the

mail
in
yes
sir
just
arrived
what
name
charles
k
spencer
the
letter
clerk
seized
a
batch
of
correspondence
and
sorted
it
with
nimble
fingers
the
form
of
the
question
told
him
that
spencer
was
interested
in
letters
stamped
for
the
greater
part
with
bland
presentments
of
bygone
presidents
of
the
united
states
in
any
event
he
would
have
known
by
long
experience
of
the
type
that
the
well
dressed
straight
limbed
strong
faced
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
was
an
american
he
withdrew
four
missives
from
the
bundle
his
quick
eyes
saw
that
three
bore
the
denver
postmark
and
the
fourth
hailed
from
leadville
that
is
all
at
present
sir
he
said
would
you
like
your
mail
sent
to
your
room
in
future
or
shall
i
keep
it
here
right
here
please
in
no
slot
i
could
receive
a
reply
by
cable
while
i
was
going
and
coming
along
my
corridor
the
clerk
smiled
deferentially
he
appreciated
not
only
the
length
of
the
corridor
but
the
price
paid
by
the
tenant
of
a
second
floor
suite
overlooking
the
river
very
well
sir
he
said
glancing
again
at
spencer
i
will
attend
to
it
and
he
took
a
mental
portrait
of
the
man
who
could
afford
to
hire
apartments
that
ranked
among
the
most
expensive
in
the
hotel
obviously
the
american
was
a
recent
arrival
his
suite
had
been
vacated
by
a
frankfort
banker
only
three
days
earlier
and
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
asked
for
letters
even
the
disillusioned
official
was
amused
by
the
difference
between
the
two
latest
occupants
of
no
herr
bamberger
a
tub
of
a
man
bald
headed
and
bespectacled
and
this
alert
sinewy
youngster
with
the
cleancut
features
of
a
greek
statue
and
the
brilliant
deep
set
earnest
eyes
of
one
to
whom
thought
and
action
were
alike
familiar
spencer
fully
aware
that
he
was
posing
for
a
necessary
picture
examined
the
dates
on
his
letters
nipped
the
end
off
a
green
cigar
helped
himself
to
a
match
from
a
box
tendered
by
a
watchful
boy
crossed
the
entrance
hall
and
descended
a
few
steps
leading
to
the
inner
foyer
and
restaurant
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
looked
about
for
a
quiet
corner
the
luncheon
hour
was
almost
ended
groups
of
smokers
and
coffee
drinkers
were
scattered
throughout
the
larger
room
which
widened
out
below
a
second
short
flight
of
carpeted
steps
the
smaller
anteroom
in
which
he
stood
was
empty
save
for
a
few
people
passing
that
way
from
the
restaurant
and
he
decided
that
a
nook
near
a
palm
shaded
balcony
offered
the
retreat
he
sought
he
little
dreamed
that
he
was
choosing
the
starting
point
of
the
most
thrilling
adventure
in
a
life
already
adventurous
that
the
soft
carpet
of
the
embankment
hotel
might
waft
him
to
scenes
not
within
the
common
scope
that
is
ever
the
way
of
true
romance
your
knight
errant
may
wander
in
the
forest
for
a
day
or
a
year
he
never
knows
the
moment
when
the
enchanted
glade
shall
open
before
his
eyes
nay
he
scarce
has
seen
the
weeping
maiden
bound
to
a
tree
ere
he
is
called
in
to
couch
his
lance
and
ride
at
the
fire
breathing
dragon
it
was
so
when
men
and
maids
dwelt
in
a
young
world
it
is
so
now
and
it
will
be
so
till
the
crack
of
doom
manners
may
change
and
costume
but
hearts
filled
with
the
wine
of
life
are
not
to
be
altered
they
are
fashioned
that
way
and
the
world
does
not
vary
else
eve
might
regain
paradise
and
all
the
fret
and
fume
have
an
end
charles
spencer
then
would
certainly
have
been
the
most
astonished
though
perhaps
the
most
self
possessed
man
in
london
had
some
guardian
sprite
whispered
low
in
his
ear
what
strange
hazard
lay
in
his
choice
of
a
chair
if
such
whisper
were
vouchsafed
to
him
he
paid
no
heed
perhaps
his
occupancy
of
that
particular
corner
was
preordained
it
was
inviting
secluded
an
upholstered
backwash
in
the
stream
of
fashion
so
he
sat
there
nearly
stunned
a
waiter
by
asking
for
a
glass
of
water
and
composed
himself
to
read
his
letters
the
waiter
hesitated
he
was
a
frenchman
and
feared
he
had
not
heard
aright
what
sort
of
water
sir
he
asked
vichy
galmier
apollinaris
spencer
looked
up
he
thought
the
man
had
gone
no
none
of
those
he
said
just
plain
unemotional
water
straight
from
the
pipe
the
microbe
laden
fluid
that
runs
off
london
tiles
most
days
i
have
been
outside
the
hotel
during
the
last
hour
but
if
you
happen
to
pass
the
door
i
guess
you
see
the
kind
of
essence
i
mean
dripping
off
umbrellas
if
you
do
keep
it
in
the
house
try
to
borrow
a
policeman
cape
and
shoot
a
quart
into
a
decanter
the
quelled
waiter
hurried
away
and
brought
a
carafe
spencer
professed
to
be
so
pleased
with
his
rare
intelligence
that
he
gave
him
a
shilling
then
he
opened
the
envelop
with
the
leadville
postmark
it
contained
a
draft
for
pounds
shillings
pence
and
the
accompanying
letter
from
a
firm
of
solicitors
showed
that
the
remittance
of
a
thousand
dollars
was
the
moiety
of
the
proceeds
of
a
on
certain
tailings
taken
over
by
the
purchasers
of
the
battle
mountain
tunnel
the
sum
was
not
a
large
one
but
it
seemed
to
give
its
recipient
such
satisfaction
that
the
movement
of
chairs
on
the
floor
of
the
big
room
just
beneath
failed
to
draw
his
attention
from
the
lawyer
statement
a
woman
languid
well
bred
voice
broke
in
on
this
apparently
pleasant
reverie
shall
we
sit
here
helen
anywhere
you
like
dear
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
thanks
to
you
i
am
passing
an
afternoon
in
wonderland
i
find
my
surroundings
so
novel
and
entertaining
that
i
should
still
be
excited
if
you
were
to
put
me
in
the
refrigerator
the
eager
vivacity
of
the
second
speaker
the
note
of
undiluted
and
almost
childlike
glee
with
which
she
acknowledged
that
a
visit
to
a
luxurious
hotel
was
a
red
letter
day
in
her
life
caused
the
man
to
glance
at
the
two
young
women
who
had
unconsciously
disturbed
him
evidently
they
had
just
risen
from
luncheon
in
the
restaurant
and
meant
to
dispose
themselves
for
a
chat
it
was
equally
clear
that
each
word
they
uttered
in
an
ordinary
conversational
tone
must
be
audible
to
him
they
were
appropriating
chairs
which
would
place
the
plumes
of
their
hats
within
a
few
inches
of
his
feet
when
seated
their
faces
would
be
hidden
from
him
save
for
a
possible
glimpse
of
a
profile
as
one
or
other
turned
toward
her
companion
but
for
a
few
seconds
he
had
a
good
view
of
both
and
he
was
young
enough
to
find
the
scrutiny
to
his
liking
at
the
first
glance
the
girl
who
was
acting
as
hostess
might
be
deemed
the
more
attractive
of
the
pair
she
was
tall
slender
charmingly
dressed
and
carried
herself
with
an
assured
elegance
that
hinted
of
the
stage
spencer
caught
a
glint
of
corn
flower
blue
eyes
beneath
long
lashes
and
a
woman
would
have
deduced
from
their
color
the
correct
explanation
of
a
blue
sunshade
a
blue
straw
hat
and
a
light
cape
of
myosotis
blue
silk
that
fell
from
shapely
shoulders
over
a
white
lace
gown
the
other
girl
she
who
answered
to
the
name
of
helen
though
nearly
as
tall
and
quite
as
graceful
was
robed
so
simply
in
muslin
that
she
might
have
provided
an
intentional
contrast
in
the
man
esteem
she
lost
nothing
thereby
he
appraised
her
by
the
fine
contour
of
her
oval
face
the
wealth
of
glossy
brown
hair
that
clustered
under
her
hat
and
the
gleam
of
white
teeth
between
lips
of
healthy
redness
again
had
he
looked
through
a
woman
eyes
he
would
have
seen
how
the
difference
between
and
kilburn
as
shopping
centers
might
be
sharply
accentuated
but
that
distinction
did
not
trouble
him
beneath
a
cold
exterior
he
had
an
artist
soul
and
helen
met
an
ideal
pretty
as
a
peach
he
said
to
himself
and
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
indeed
for
an
instant
he
forgot
himself
and
it
was
not
until
she
spoke
again
that
he
realized
how
utterly
oblivious
were
both
girls
of
his
nearness
i
suppose
everybody
who
comes
here
is
very
rich
was
her
rather
comment
her
companion
laughed
how
nice
of
you
to
put
it
that
way
it
makes
me
feel
quite
important
i
lunch
or
dine
or
sup
here
often
and
the
direct
inference
is
that
i
am
rolling
in
wealth
well
dear
you
earn
a
great
deal
of
money
i
get
twenty
pounds
a
week
and
this
frock
i
am
wearing
cost
really
helen
you
are
the
sweetest
little
goose
i
ever
met
you
live
in
london
but
are
not
of
it
you
have
grasped
the
first
principle
of
social
existence
if
i
dressed
within
my
means
and
never
spent
a
sovereign
until
it
was
in
my
purse
i
should
not
even
earn
the
sovereign
i
simply
must
mix
with
this
crowd
whether
i
can
afford
it
or
not
but
surely
you
are
paid
for
your
art
not
as
a
mannikin
you
are
almost
in
the
front
rank
of
musical
comedy
i
have
seen
you
occasionally
at
the
theater
and
i
thought
you
were
the
best
dancer
in
the
company
what
about
my
singing
you
have
a
very
agreeable
and
well
trained
voice
i
afraid
you
are
incorrigible
you
ought
to
have
said
that
i
sang
better
than
i
danced
and
the
fib
would
have
pleased
me
immensely
we
women
like
to
hear
ourselves
praised
for
accomplishments
we
possess
no
my
dear
rule
art
out
of
the
cast
and
substitute
advertisement
did
you
notice
a
dowdy
creature
who
was
lunching
with
two
men
on
your
right
she
wore
a
brown
tussore
silk
and
a
turban
well
she
writes
the
about
people
in
daily
journal
i
bet
you
a
pair
of
gloves
that
you
will
see
something
like
this
in
paper
archie
beaumanoir
entertained
a
party
of
friends
at
the
embankment
hotel
yesterday
at
the
next
table
miss
millicent
jaques
of
the
wellington
theater
was
lunching
with
a
pretty
girl
whom
i
did
not
know
miss
jaques
wore
an
exquisite
etc
fill
in
full
details
of
my
personal
appearance
and
you
have
the
complete
paragraph
the
public
the
stupid
public
fatten
on
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
keeps
me
going
far
more
effectively
than
my
feeble
attempts
to
warble
a
couple
of
songs
which
you
could
sing
far
better
if
only
you
made
up
your
mind
to
come
on
the
stage
but
there
after
such
unwonted
candor
i
must
have
a
smoke
you
wo
try
a
cigarette
well
do
look
so
shocked
this
is
a
church
you
know
spencer
who
had
listened
with
interest
to
miss
jaques
outspoken
views
suddenly
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
an
eavesdropper
he
had
all
an
american
chivalrous
instincts
where
women
were
concerned
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
betake
himself
and
his
letters
to
his
own
room
yet
when
all
was
said
and
done
he
was
in
a
hotel
the
girls
were
strangers
and
likely
to
remain
so
and
it
was
their
own
affair
if
they
chose
to
indulge
in
unguarded
confidences
so
he
compromised
with
his
scruples
by
pouring
out
a
glass
of
water
replacing
the
decanter
on
its
tray
with
some
degree
of
noise
then
he
struck
an
unnecessary
match
and
applied
it
to
his
cigar
before
opening
the
first
of
the
denver
letters
as
his
glance
was
momentarily
diverted
he
did
not
grasp
the
essential
fact
that
neither
of
the
pair
was
disturbed
by
his
well
meant
efforts
millicent
jaques
was
lighting
a
cigarette
and
this
to
a
woman
is
an
all
absorbing
achievement
while
her
friend
was
so
new
to
her
palatial
surroundings
that
she
had
not
the
least
notion
of
the
existence
of
another
open
floor
just
above
the
level
of
her
eyes
i
do
know
how
in
the
world
you
manage
to
exist
went
on
the
actress
tilting
herself
back
in
her
chair
to
watch
the
smoke
curling
lazily
upward
what
was
it
you
said
the
other
day
when
we
met
you
are
some
sort
of
secretary
and
amanuensis
to
a
scientist
does
that
mean
typewriting
and
what
is
the
science
professor
von
eulenberg
is
a
well
known
man
was
the
quiet
reply
i
type
his
essays
and
reports
it
is
true
but
i
also
assist
in
his
classification
work
and
it
is
very
interesting
what
does
he
classify
mostly
beetles
oh
how
horrid
do
you
ever
see
any
thousands
i
should
find
one
enough
if
it
is
a
fair
question
what
does
your
professor
pay
you
thirty
shillings
a
week
in
his
own
way
he
is
as
poor
as
i
am
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
can
live
in
those
nice
rooms
you
took
me
to
and
dress
decently
on
that
sum
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
i
have
a
small
pension
and
i
earn
a
little
by
writing
titbits
of
scientific
gossip
for
firefly
herr
von
eulenberg
helps
he
translates
interesting
paragraphs
from
the
foreign
technical
papers
and
i
jot
them
down
and
by
that
means
i
pick
up
sufficient
to
buy
an
extra
hat
or
wrap
and
go
to
a
theater
or
a
concert
but
i
have
to
be
careful
as
my
employer
is
absent
each
summer
for
two
months
he
goes
abroad
to
hunt
new
specimens
and
of
course
i
am
not
paid
then
is
he
away
now
yes
and
how
do
you
pass
your
time
i
write
a
good
deal
some
day
i
hope
to
get
a
story
accepted
by
one
of
the
magazines
but
it
is
so
hard
for
a
beginner
to
find
an
opening
yet
when
i
offered
to
give
you
a
start
in
the
chorus
of
the
best
theater
in
london
a
thing
mind
you
that
thousands
of
girls
are
aching
for
you
refused
i
sorry
millie
dear
but
i
am
not
cut
out
for
the
stage
it
does
not
appeal
to
me
heigho
tastes
differ
stick
to
your
beetles
then
and
marry
your
professor
helen
laughed
with
a
fresh
joyousness
that
was
good
to
hear
herr
von
eulenberg
is
blessed
with
an
exceedingly
stout
wife
and
five
very
healthy
children
already
she
cried
then
that
settles
it
you
mad
quite
mad
let
us
talk
of
something
else
do
you
ever
have
a
holiday
where
are
you
going
this
year
off
to
champèry
when
the
theater
closes
champèry
in
switzerland
is
it
yes
ah
that
is
the
dream
of
my
life
to
see
the
everlasting
snows
to
climb
those
grand
solemn
mountains
to
cross
the
great
passes
that
one
reads
of
in
the
travel
books
now
at
last
you
have
made
me
envious
are
you
going
alone
but
of
course
that
is
a
foolish
question
you
intend
to
join
others
from
the
theater
no
doubt
well
er
something
of
the
sort
i
fear
my
enthusiasm
will
not
carry
me
far
on
the
lines
that
would
appeal
to
you
i
suppose
you
consider
a
short
skirt
strong
boots
a
tyrolese
hat
and
an
alpenstock
to
be
a
sufficient
whereas
my
mountaineering
costumes
will
fill
five
large
trunks
and
three
hat
boxes
i
afraid
helen
we
do
run
on
the
same
rails
as
our
american
cousins
say
there
was
a
little
pause
millicent
words
apparently
tossed
lightly
into
the
air
after
a
smoke
spiral
had
in
them
a
touch
of
bitterness
it
might
be
of
self
analysis
her
guest
seemed
to
take
thought
before
she
answered
perhaps
the
divergence
is
mainly
in
environment
and
i
have
always
inclined
to
the
more
serious
side
of
life
even
when
we
were
together
in
brussels
you
serious
at
madam
bérard
i
like
that
who
was
it
that
kicked
the
plaster
off
the
dormitory
wall
higher
than
her
head
who
put
pepper
in
signor
antonio
snuff
box
spencer
saw
the
outer
waves
of
a
flush
on
helen
cheeks
this
is
exceedingly
interesting
he
thought
but
i
can
not
even
persuade
myself
that
i
ought
to
listen
any
longer
yet
if
i
rise
now
and
walk
away
they
will
know
i
heard
every
word
nevertheless
he
meant
to
go
at
the
risk
of
their
embarrassment
but
he
waited
for
helen
reply
she
laughed
and
the
ripple
of
her
mirth
was
as
musical
as
her
voice
whereas
many
women
dowered
with
pleasantly
modulated
notes
for
ordinary
conversation
should
be
careful
never
to
indulge
in
laughter
which
is
less
controllable
and
therefore
natural
that
is
the
worst
of
having
a
past
she
said
let
me
put
it
then
that
entomology
as
a
pursuit
sternly
represses
frivolousness
does
entomology
mean
beetles
my
dear
if
you
asked
herr
von
eulenberg
that
question
he
would
sate
your
curiosity
with
page
extracts
from
one
of
his
books
he
has
written
a
whole
volume
to
prove
that
the
only
true
entoma
or
insects
are
condylopoda
and
hexapoda
which
means
cockroaches
good
gracious
to
think
of
helen
wynton
who
once
hit
a
belgian
boy
very
hard
on
the
nose
for
being
rude
wasting
her
life
on
such
rubbish
and
you
actually
seem
to
thrive
on
it
i
do
believe
you
are
far
happier
than
i
at
present
i
am
envying
you
that
trip
to
champèry
why
can
not
some
fairy
godmother
call
in
at
no
warburton
gardens
and
wave
over
my
awed
head
a
wand
that
shall
scatter
sleeping
car
tickets
and
banknotes
galore
or
at
any
rate
sufficient
thereof
to
take
me
to
the
engadine
and
back
ah
the
engadine
i
am
not
going
there
this
year
i
think
have
you
planned
your
tour
yet
no
that
is
not
exactly
do
you
know
that
is
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures
with
a
last
continental
bradshaw
and
a
few
tattered
baedekers
i
journey
far
afield
i
know
the
times
the
fares
and
the
stopping
places
of
all
the
main
routes
from
calais
and
boulogne
i
could
pass
a
creditable
examination
in
most
of
the
boat
and
train
services
by
way
of
ostend
flushing
and
the
hook
of
holland
i
assure
you
millie
when
my
ship
does
come
home
or
the
glittering
lady
whom
i
have
invoked
deigns
to
visit
my
lodgings
i
shall
call
a
cab
for
charing
cross
or
victoria
with
the
assurance
of
a
seasoned
traveler
for
some
reason
miss
jaques
refused
to
share
her
friend
enthusiasm
you
are
easily
pleased
she
said
listlessly
for
my
part
after
one
shuddering
glance
at
the
channel
i
try
to
deaden
all
sensation
till
i
find
myself
dressing
for
dinner
at
the
ritz
i
positively
refuse
to
go
beyond
paris
the
first
day
ah
bother
here
comes
a
man
whom
i
wish
to
avoid
let
us
be
on
the
move
before
he
sees
us
which
he
can
not
fail
to
do
do
forget
that
i
have
a
rehearsal
at
three
i
have
really
but
we
must
escape
somehow
spencer
who
had
salved
his
conscience
by
endeavoring
to
read
a
technical
letter
on
mining
affairs
would
be
less
than
human
if
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
then
it
is
odd
how
the
sense
of
hearing
when
left
to
its
unfettered
play
by
the
absence
of
the
disturbing
influence
of
facial
expression
can
discriminate
in
its
analysis
of
the
subtler
emotions
he
was
quite
sure
that
miss
jaques
was
startled
even
annoyed
by
the
appearance
of
some
person
whom
she
did
not
expect
to
meet
and
he
surveyed
the
new
arrival
critically
perhaps
with
latent
hostility
he
saw
a
corpulent
well
dressed
man
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
looking
around
the
spacious
room
obviously
he
had
not
come
from
the
restaurant
he
carried
his
hat
gloves
and
stick
in
his
left
hand
with
his
right
hand
he
caressed
his
chin
and
his
glance
wandered
slowly
over
the
little
knots
of
people
in
the
foyer
beyond
the
fact
that
a
large
diamond
sparkled
on
one
of
his
plump
fingers
and
that
his
olive
tinted
face
was
curiously
opposed
to
the
whiteness
of
the
uplifted
hand
he
differed
in
no
essential
from
the
hundreds
of
spick
and
span
idlers
who
might
be
encountered
at
that
hour
in
the
west
end
of
london
he
had
the
physique
and
bearing
of
a
man
athletic
in
his
youth
but
now
an
astute
tailor
had
managed
to
conceal
the
too
rounded
curves
of
the
fourth
decade
by
fashioning
his
garments
skillfully
his
coat
fitted
like
a
skin
across
his
shoulders
but
hung
loosely
in
front
the
braid
of
a
colored
waistcoat
was
a
marvel
of
suggestion
in
indicating
a
waist
and
the
same
adept
craftsmanship
carried
the
eye
in
faultless
lines
to
his
verni
boots
judged
by
his
profile
he
was
not
ill
looking
his
features
were
regular
the
mouth
and
chin
strong
the
forehead
slightly
rounded
and
the
nose
gave
the
merest
hint
of
semitic
origin
taken
altogether
he
had
the
style
of
a
polished
man
of
the
world
and
spencer
smiled
at
the
sudden
fancy
that
seized
him
i
am
attending
the
first
act
of
a
little
play
he
thought
helen
and
millicent
rise
and
move
to
center
of
stage
enter
the
conventional
villain
miss
jaques
was
not
mistaken
when
she
said
that
her
acquaintance
would
surely
see
her
she
and
helen
wynton
had
not
advanced
a
yard
from
their
corner
before
the
newcomer
discovered
them
he
hastened
to
meet
them
with
the
aspect
of
one
equally
surprised
and
delighted
his
manners
were
courtly
and
displayed
great
friendliness
but
spencer
was
quick
to
notice
the
air
of
interest
with
which
his
gaze
rested
on
helen
it
was
possible
to
see
now
that
millicent
unexpected
friend
had
large
prominent
dark
eyes
which
lent
animation
and
vivacity
to
a
face
otherwise
heavy
and
coarse
it
was
impossible
to
hear
all
that
was
said
as
the
trio
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
a
couple
of
men
passing
up
the
stairs
at
the
moment
were
talking
loudly
but
spencer
gathered
that
millicent
was
explaining
volubly
how
she
and
miss
wynton
had
dropped
in
here
for
luncheon
by
the
merest
chance
and
was
equally
emphatic
in
the
declaration
that
she
was
already
overdue
at
the
theater
the
man
said
something
and
glanced
again
at
helen
evidently
he
asked
for
an
introduction
which
miss
jaques
gave
with
an
affability
that
was
eloquent
of
her
powers
as
an
actress
the
unwished
for
cavalier
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
he
walked
with
them
up
the
stairs
and
crossed
the
entrance
hall
spencer
stuffing
his
letters
into
a
pocket
strolled
that
way
too
and
saw
this
pirate
in
a
morning
coat
bear
off
both
girls
in
a
capacious
motor
car
not
to
be
balked
of
the
dénouement
of
the
little
comedy
in
real
life
for
which
he
had
provided
the
audience
the
american
grabbed
the
hall
porter
say
he
said
do
you
know
that
gentleman
yes
sir
that
is
mark
bower
spencer
beamed
on
the
man
as
though
he
had
just
discovered
that
mark
bower
was
his
dearest
friend
well
now
if
that
is
the
queerest
thing
he
said
is
that
mark
he
just
gone
round
to
the
wellington
theater
i
guess
how
far
is
it
from
here
not
a
hundred
yards
sir
off
went
spencer
without
his
hat
he
had
intended
to
follow
in
a
cab
but
a
sprint
would
be
more
effective
over
such
a
short
distance
he
crossed
the
strand
without
heed
to
the
traffic
turned
to
the
right
and
to
use
his
own
phrase
butted
into
a
policeman
at
the
first
corner
i
on
the
hunt
for
the
wellington
theater
he
explained
you
need
hunt
much
farther
said
the
constable
good
humoredly
there
it
is
a
little
way
up
on
the
left
at
that
instant
spencer
saw
bower
raise
his
hat
to
the
two
women
they
hurried
inside
the
theater
and
their
escort
turned
to
reënter
his
motor
the
american
had
learned
what
he
wanted
to
know
miss
jaques
had
shaken
off
her
presumed
admirer
and
miss
wynton
had
aided
and
abetted
her
in
the
deed
you
do
say
he
exclaimed
gazing
at
the
building
admiringly
it
looks
new
in
fact
the
whole
street
has
a
kind
of
san
appearance
that
right
sir
it
not
so
long
since
some
of
the
worst
slums
in
london
were
pulled
down
to
make
way
for
it
it
fine
but
i
rather
stuck
on
antiquities
i
seen
plenty
of
last
year
palaces
on
the
other
side
have
a
drink
will
you
when
time
up
the
policeman
glanced
surreptitiously
at
the
which
spencer
insinuated
into
his
palm
and
looked
after
the
donor
as
he
went
back
to
the
hotel
well
i
jiggered
he
said
to
himself
i
often
heard
tell
of
the
way
some
americans
see
london
but
i
never
came
across
a
chap
who
rushed
up
in
his
bare
head
and
took
a
squint
at
any
place
in
that
fashion
he
seemed
to
have
his
wits
about
him
too
but
there
must
be
a
screw
loose
somewhere
and
indeed
charles
spencer
had
he
paused
to
take
stock
of
his
behavior
must
have
admitted
that
it
was
to
say
the
least
erratic
but
his
imagination
was
fired
his
sympathies
were
all
with
the
thought
that
it
lay
within
his
power
to
share
with
a
kin
soul
some
small
part
of
the
good
fortune
that
had
fallen
to
his
lot
of
late
wants
a
fairy
godmother
does
she
he
asked
himself
and
the
quiet
humor
that
gleamed
in
his
face
caused
more
than
one
passerby
to
turn
and
watch
him
as
he
strode
along
the
pavement
well
i
guess
play
a
character
not
hitherto
heard
of
in
the
legitimate
drama
what
price
the
fairy
godfather
i
a
picture
of
myself
in
that
rôle
oh
my
see
me
twirl
that
wand
helen
you
shall
climb
those
rocks
but
i
do
like
your
friend
i
send
you
to
champèry
no
off
the

for
you
chapter

the
fulfillment
of
the
wish
explanations
of
motive
are
apt
to
become
tedious
they
are
generally
inaccurate
too
for
who
can
reduce
a
fantasy
to
a
formula
nor
should
they
ever
be
allowed
to
clip
the
wings
of
romance
but
the
painter
who
bade
his
subject
sit
under
a
sodium
light
would
justly
be
deemed
a
lunatic
and
any
analysis
of
spencer
character
drawn
from
his
latest
prank
would
be
faulty
in
the
extreme
in
all
london
at
that
moment
there
was
not
a
more
level
headed
man
of
his
years
he
was
an
expert
mining
engineer
and
the
successful
pioneer
of
a
new
method
of
hauling
ore
even
in
western
america
god
own
country
as
it
is
held
to
be
by
those
who
live
there
few
men
arrive
so
early
in
life
some

is
true
amass
wealth
by
lucky
speculation
before
they
are
fitted
by
experience
to
earn
the
price
of
a
suit
of
clothes
but
they
are
of
the
freak
order
they
are
not
to
be
classed
with
one
who
by
hard
work
wrests
a
fortune
out
of
the
grim
colorado
granite
spencer
had
been
called
on
to
endure
long
years
of
rebuff
and
scorn
though
scoffed
at
by
many
who
thought
he
was
wrong
he
persisted
because
he
knew
he
was
right
ofttimes
fate
will
test
such
a
man
almost
to
breaking
point
then
she
yields
and
being
feminine
her
obduracy
is
the
measure
of
her
favors
for
she
will
bestow
on
her
dogged
suitor
all
and
more
than
all
that
he
desired
the
draft
from
leadville
crammed
so
carelessly
into
a
pocket
when
he
followed
the
three
to
the
door
was
a
fair
instance
of
this
trick
of
hers
a
tunnel
projected
and
constructed
in
the
teeth
of
ridicule
and
financial
opposition
had
linked
up
the
underground
workings
of
several
mines
and
proved
conclusively
that
it
was
far
cheaper
to
bring
minerals
to
the
rail
in
that
manner
than
to
sink
expensive
shafts
raise
the
ore
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
cart
it
to
its
old
level
in
the
valley
once
the
thing
was
indisputable
the
young
engineer
found
himself
rich
and
famous
to
increase
the
feeders
of
the
main
bore
he
drove
another
short
gallery
through
a
mining
claim
acquired
for
a
few
dollars
a
claim
deemed
worthless
owing
to
a
geological
fault
that
traversed
its
whole
length
that
was
fate
opportunity
doubtless
she
smiled
mischievously
when
she
gave
him
a
vein
of
rich
quartz
through
which
to
quarry
his
way
the
mere
delving
of
the
rock
had
produced
two
thousand
dollars
worth
of
ore
of
which
sum
he
took
a
moiety
by
agreement
with
the
company
that
purchased
his
rights
people
in
leadville
soon
discovered
that
spencer
was
a
bright
man
yes
sir
a
citizen
of
whom
the
chief
mining
city
of
the
rocky
mountains
has
every
reason
to
be
proud
and
the
railway
magnate
who
had
nearly
ruined
him
by
years
of
hostility
buried
the
past
grandiloquently
with
a
charles
spencer
ca
be
sidetracked
he
said
that
k
is
in
his
name
by
accident
look
at
it
a
regular
buffer
of
a
letter
tell
you
what
you
may
monkey
with
charles
but
when
you
hit
the
k
look
out
for
trouble
whereupon
the
miners
laughed
and
said
that
the
president
was
a
mighty
smart
man
too
and
spencer
who
knew
he
was
a
thief
but
was
unwilling
to
quarrel
with
him
for
the
sake
of
the
company
thought
that
a
six
months
vacation
in
europe
would
make
for
peace
and
general
content
he
had
no
plans
he
was
free
to
wander
whithersoever
chance
led
him
arriving
in
london
from
plymouth
late
on
a
thursday
evening
he
took
a
holiday
on
friday
finding
a
tunnel
under
the
thames
in
full
progress
near
the
hotel
he
sought
the
resident
engineer
spoke
to
him
in
the
lingua
franca
of
the
craft
and
spent
several
dangerous
and
enjoyable
hours
in
crawling
through
all
manner
of
uncomfortable
passages
bored
by
human
worms
beneath
the
bed
of
the
river
and
this
was
saturday
and
here
he
was
at
three
in
the
afternoon
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
best
way
of
sending
on
an
expensive
trip
abroad
a
girl
who
had
not
the
remotest
notion
of
his
existence
it
was
a
whim
and
a
harmless
one
and
he
excused
it
to
his
practical
mind
by
the
reflection
that
he
was
entitled
to
one
day
of
extravagance
after
seven
years
of
hard
labor
for
his
own
part
he
was
weary
of
mountains
he
had
wrought
against
one
frowning
and
stubborn
as
any
alp
and
had
not
desisted
until
he
reached
its
very
heart
with
a
four
thousand
foot
lance
switzerland
was
the
last
place
in
europe
he
would
visit
he
wanted
to
see
old
cities
and
dim
cathedrals
to
lounge
in
pleasant
lands
where
rivers
murmured
past
lush
meadows
though
an
american
born
and
bred
there
was
a
tradition
in
his
home
that
the
spencers
were
once
people
of
note
on
the
border
when
tired
of
london
he
meant
to
go
north
and
ramble
through
liddesdale
in
search
of
family
records
but
the
business
presently
on
hand
was
to
arrange
that
swiss
excursion
for
helen
and
he
set
about
it
with
characteristic
energy
in
the
first
instance
he
noted
her
name
and
address
on
the
back
of
the
leadville
envelop
then
he
sought
the
manager
i
guess
you
know
switzerland
pretty
well
he
said
when
a
polite
man
was
produced
by
a
boy
the
assumption
was
well
founded
in
fact
the
first
really
important
looking
object
the
manager
remembered
seeing
in
this
world
was
the
giant
matterhorn
because
his
mother
told
him
that
if
he
was
a
bad
boy
he
would
be
carried
off
by
the
demons
that
dwelt
on
its
summit
what
sort
of
places
are
and
champèry
went
on
spencer
evian
is
a
fashionable
lakeside
town
champèry
is
in
the
hills
behind
it
when
evian
becomes
too
hot
in
august
one
goes
to
champèry
to
cool
down
are
they
anywhere
near
the
engadine
good
gracious
no
they
are
as
different
as
chalk
and
cheese
is
the
engadine
the
cheese
does
it
take
the
biscuit
the
manager
laughed
like
all
londoners
he
regarded
every
american
as
a
humorist
it
all
depends
he
said
for
my
part
i
think
the
upper
engadine
is
far
and
away
the
most
charming
section
of
switzerland
but
there
are
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
who
would
unhesitatingly
vote
for
evian
and
for
a
score
of
other
places
where
there
are
promenades
and
casinos
are
you
thinking
of
making
a
tour
there
there
no
telling
where
i
may
bring
up
when
i
cross
the
channel
said
spencer
i
have
heard
some
talk
of
the
two
districts
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
were
just
the
man
to
give
me
a
few
useful
pointers
well
the
average
tourist
rushes
from
one
valley
to
another
tramps
over
a
pass
each
morning
and
spends
the
afternoon
in
a
train
or
on
board
a
lake
steamer
but
if
i
wanted
a
real
rest
and
wished
at
the
same
time
to
be
in
a
center
from
which
pleasant
walks
or
stiff
climbs
for
that
matter
could
be
obtained
i
should
go
by
the
engadine
express
to
moritz
and
drive
from
there
to
the
where
there
is
an
excellent
hotel
and
usually
a
number
of
nice
people
english
yes
english
and
americans
they
select
the
best
as
a
rule
you
know
it
sounds
attractive
said
spencer
and
it
is
believe
me
do
forget
the
name
it
is
twelve
miles
from
everywhere
and
practically
consists
of
the
one
big
hotel
spencer
procured
his
hat
gloves
and
stick
and
called
a
cab
take
me
to
firefly
office
he
said
beg
pawdon
sir
but
where
that
asked
the
driver
it
up
to
you
to
find
out
then
is
it
i
heerd
of
the
an
the
chicken
friend
the
cat
an
the
bee
but
the
firefly
leaves
me
thinkin
is
it
a
noospaper
something
of
the
sort
all
right
sir
jump
in
we
soon
be
on
its
track
the
hansom
scampered
off
to
as
the
result
of
inquiries
spencer
was
deposited
at
the
entrance
to
a
dingy
court
the
depths
of
which
he
was
assured
were
illumined
by
the
firefly
there
is
nothing
that
so
mystifies
the
citizen
of
the
new
world
as
the
aspect
of
some
of
the
business
establishments
of
london
he
soon
learns
however
to
differentiate
between
the
spidery
dens
where
money
is
amassed
and
the
soot
laden
tenements
in
which
the
struggle
for
existence
is
keen
a
comprehensive
glance
at
the
exterior
of
the
premises
occupied
by
the
firefly
at
once
explained
to
spencer
why
the
cabman
did
not
know
its
whereabouts
three
small
rooms
sufficed
for
its
literary
and
commercial
staff
and
to
let
notices
stared
from
several
windows
in
the
same
building
appearances
are
deceptive
ever
murmured
he
as
he
scanned
the
legends
on
three
doors
in
a
narrow
lobby
but
i
think
i
beginning
to
catch
on
to
the
limited
extent
of
miss
helen
earnings
from
her
scientific
paragraphs
he
knocked
at
each
door
but
received
no
answer
then
having
sharp
ears
he
tried
the
handle
of
one
marked
private
it
yielded
and
he
entered
to
be
accosted
angrily
by
a
pallid
elderly
bewhiskered
man
standing
in
front
of
a
much
littered
table
confound
it
sir
came
the
growl
do
you
know
it
is
saturday
afternoon
and
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
in
unannounced
guess
you
the
editor
said
spencer
what
if
i
am
i
just
happened
along
to
have
a
few
quiet
words
with
you
if
there
no
callers
saturdays
why
that
exactly
what
i
want
and
i
came
right
in
because
you
did
answer
my
knock
i
tell
you
i
not
supposed
to
be
here
then
you
should
draw
corks
while
anybody
is
damaging
the
paint
outside
spencer
smiled
so
agreeably
that
the
editor
of
the
firefly
softened
at
first
he
had
taken
his
visitor
for
an
unpaid
contributor
but
the
american
accent
banished
this
phantom
of
the
imagination
he
continued
to
pour
into
a
tumbler
the
contents
of
a
bottle
of
beer
well
he
said
now
that
you
are
here
what
can
i
do
for
you
spencer
charles
k
spencer
instantly
it
struck
the
younger
man
that
little
more
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
since
he
gave
his
name
to
the
letter
clerk
in
the
hotel
the
singularity
of
his
proceedings
during
that
hour
was
thereby
brought
home
to
him
he
knew
nothing
of
newspapers
daily
or
weekly
but
commonsense
suggested
that
the
firefly
radiance
was
not
his
native
shrewdness
advised
caution
though
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
in
homely
phrase
twist
this
faded
journalist
round
his
little
finger
before
i
open
the
ball
he
said
may
i
see
a
copy
of
your
magazine
meanwhile
the
other
was
trying
to
sum
him
up
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
visitor
meant
to
introduce
some
new
advertising
scheme
and
as
the
firefly
was
sorely
in
need
of
advertisements
he
decided
to
listen
here
is
last
week
issue
he
said
handing
to
spencer
a
small
publication
the
american
glanced
through
it
rapidly
while
the
editor
sampled
the
beer
i
see
said
spencer
after
he
had
found
a
column
signed
which
consisted
of
paragraphs
translated
from
a
german
article
on
airships
i
see
that
firefly
scintillates
around
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
editor
relaxed
sufficiently
to
smile
that
is
a
good
description
of
its
weekly
flights
he
said
you
do
use
many
cuts
they
are
expensive
and
hard
to
obtain
for
such
subjects
as
we
favor
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
notion
to
brighten
it
up
a
bit
put
in
something
lively
and
more
in
keeping
with
the
name
i
have
no
opening
for
new
matter
if
that
is
what
you
mean
and
the
editor
stiffened
again
but
you
have
the
as
to
the
contents
i
suppose
oh
yes
the
selection
rests
with
me
good
i
sort
of
interested
in
a
young
lady
miss
helen
wynton
by
name
she
lives
in
warburton
gardens
and
does
work
for
you
occasionally
now
i
propose
to
send
her
on
a
month
trip
to
switzerland
where
she
will
represent
firefly
you
must
get
her
to
turn
out
a
couple
of
pages
of
readable
stuff
each
week
which
you
will
have
illustrated
by
a
smart
artist
at
a
cost
of
say
twenty
pounds
an
article
for
drawings
and
blocks
i
pay
all
expenses
she
gets
the
trip
and
you
secure
some
good
copy
for
nothing
is
it
a
deal
the
editor
sat
down
suddenly
and
combed
his
whiskers
with
nervous
fingers
he
was
a
weak
man
and
a
too
liberal
beer
diet
was
not
good
for
him
are
you
in
earnest
mr
spencer
he
queried
in
a
bewildered
way
dead
in
earnest
you
write
the
necessary
letter
to
miss
wynton
while
i
am
here
and
i
hand
you
the
first
twenty
in
notes
you
are
to
tell
her
to
call
monday
noon
at
any
bank
you
may
select
and
she
will
be
given
her
tickets
and
a
hundred
pounds
when
i
am
certain
that
she
has
started
i
undertake
to
pay
you
a
further
sum
of
sixty
pounds
i
make
only
two
conditions
you
must
guarantee
to
star
her
work
as
it
should
help
her
some
and
my
identity
must
not
be
disclosed
to
her
under
any
circumstances
in
a
word
she
must
regard
herself
as
the
accredited
correspondent
of
firefly
if
she
appears
to
be
a
trifle
rattled
by
your
generosity
in
the
matter
of
terms
you
must
try
and
look
as
if
you
did
that
sort
of
thing
occasionally
and
would
like
to
do
it
often
the
editor
pushed
his
chair
away
from
the
table
he
seemed
to
require
more
air
again
i
must
ask
you
if
you
actually
mean
what
you
say
he
gasped
spencer
opened
a
pocketbook
and
counted
four
notes
out
of
a
goodly
bundle
it
is
all
here
in
neat
copperplate
he
said
placing
the
notes
on
the
table
maybe
you
have
caught
on
to
the
root
idea
of
the
proposition
he
continued
seeing
that
the
other
man
was
staring
at
him
blankly
i
want
miss
wynton
to
have
a
real
good
time
i
also
want
to
lift
her
up
a
few
rungs
of
the
journalistic
ladder
but
she
is
sensitive
and
would
resent
patronage
so
i
must
not
figure
in
the
affair
at
all
i
have
no
other
motive
at
the
back
of
my
head
putting
up
two
hundred
pounds
out
of
sheer
philanthropy
will
you
help
there
are
points
about
this
amazing
proposal
that
require
elucidation
said
the
editor
slowly
travel
articles
might
possibly
come
within
the
scope
of
firefly
but
i
am
aware
that
miss
wynton
is
what
might
be
termed
an
exceedingly
attractive
young
lady
for
instance
you
would
be
philanthropic
on
my
account
you
never
can
tell
it
all
depends
how
your
case
appealed
to
me
but
if
you
are
hinting
that
i
intend
to
use
my
scheme
for
the
purpose
of
winning
miss
wynton
favorable
regard
i
must
say
that
she
strikes
me
as
the
kind
of
girl
who
would
think
she
had
been
swindled
if
she
learned
the
truth
in
any
event
i
may
never
see
her
again
and
it
is
certainly
not
my
design
to
follow
her
to
switzerland
i
do
kick
at
your
questions
you
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
mine
for
that
matter
go
ahead
this
is
saturday
afternoon
you
know
and
there
no
business
stirring
spencer
had
to
cover
the
ground
a
second
time
before
everything
was
made
clear
at
last
the
fateful
letter
was
written
he
promised
to
call
on
monday
and
learn
how
the
project
fared
then
he
relieved
the
cabman
anxiety
as
the
alley
possessed
a
second
exit
and
was
driven
to
the
wellington
theater
where
he
secured
a
stall
for
that
performance
of
the
chinese
musical
comedy
in
which
miss
millicent
jaques
played
the
part
of
a
british
admiral
daughter
while
spencer
was
watching
helen
hostess
cutting
capers
in
a
mandarin
palace
helen
herself
was
reading
over
and
over
again
a
most
wonderful
letter
that
had
fallen
from
her
sky
it
had
all
the
appearance
of
any
ordinary
missive
the
king
face
on
a
penny
stamp
or
so
much
of
it
as
was
left
uninjured
by
a
postal
smudge
looked
familiar
enough
and
both
envelop
and
paper
resembled
those
which
had
brought
her
other
communications
from
the
firefly
but
the
text
was
magic
rank
necromancy
no
wizard
who
ever
dealt
in
black
letter
treatises
could
have
devised
a
more
convincing
proof
of
his
occult
powers
than
this
straightforward
offer
made
by
the
editor
of
the
firefly
four
articles
of
five
thousand
words
each
tickets
and
pounds
awaiting
her
at
a
bank
go
to
the
hotel
leave
london
at
the
earliest
possible
date
please
send
photographs
and
suggestions
for
illustrations
of
mountaineering
and
society
what
could
it
possibly
mean
at
the
third
reading
helen
began
to
convince
herself
that
this
rare
stroke
of
luck
was
really
hers
the
concluding
paragraph
shed
light
on
the
firefly
extraordinary
outburst
as
this
commission
heralds
a
new
departure
for
the
paper
i
have
to
ask
you
to
be
good
enough
not
to
make
known
the
object
of
your
journey
in
fact
it
will
be
as
well
if
you
do
not
state
your
whereabouts
to
any
persons
other
than
your
near
relatives
of
course
all
need
for
secrecy
ceases
with
the
appearance
of
your
first
article
but
by
that
time
you
will
practically
be
on
your
way
home
again
i
am
anxious
to
impress
on
you
the
importance
of
this
instruction
helen
found
herein
the
germ
of
understanding
the
firefly
meant
to
boom
itself
on
its
swiss
correspondence
but
even
that
darksome
piece
of
journalistic
enterprise
did
not
explain
the
princely
munificence
of
the
hundred
pounds
at
last
when
she
calmed
down
sufficiently
to
be
capable
of
connected
thought
she
saw
that
mountaineering
implied
the
hire
of
guides
and
that
society
meant
frocks
of
course
it
was
intended
that
she
should
spend
the
whole
of
the
money
and
thus
give
the
firefly
a
fair
return
for
its
outlay
and
a
rapid
calculation
revealed
the
dazzling
fact
that
after
setting
aside
the
fabulous
sum
of
two
pounds
a
day
for
expenses
she
still
had
forty
pounds
left
wherewith
to
replenish
her
scanty
stock
of
dresses
believing
that
at
any
instant
the
letter
might
dissolve
into
a
curt
request
to
keep
her
scientific
jottings
strictly
within
the
limits
of
a
column
helen
sat
with
it
lying
open
on
her
lap
and
searched
the
pages
of
a
tattered
guidebook
for
particulars
of
the
upper
engadine
she
had
read
every
line
before
but
the
words
now
seemed
to
live
moritz
pontresina
silvaplana
they
ceased
to
be
mere
names
they
became
actualities
the
julier
pass
the
septimer
the
forno
glacier
the
diavolezza
route
and
the
rest
of
the
stately
panorama
of
snow
capped
peaks
blue
lakes
and
narrow
valleys
valleys
which
began
with
picturesque
chalets
dun
colored
cattle
and
herb
laden
pastures
and
ended
in
the
yawning
mouths
of
ice
rivers
whence
issued
the
milky
white
streams
that
dashed
through
the
lower
gorges
they
passed
before
her
eyes
as
she
read
till
she
was
dazzled
by
their
glories
what
a
day
dream
to
one
who
dwelt
in
smoky
london
year
in
and
year
out
what
an
experience
to
look
forward
to
what
memories
to
treasure
nor
was
she
blind
to
the
effect
of
the
undertaking
on
her
future
though
the
firefly
was
not
an
important
paper
though
its
editor
was
of
a
day
and
generation
she
would
now
have
good
work
to
show
when
asked
what
she
had
done
she
was
not
enamored
of
beetles
even
the
classifying
of
them
was
monotonous
and
she
had
striven
bravely
to
push
her
way
through
the
throng
of
writers
that
besieged
the
doors
of
every
popular
periodical
in
london
it
was
a
heartbreaking
struggle
the
same
post
that
gave
her
this
epoch
marking
letter
had
brought
back
two
stories
with
the
stereotyped
expression
of
editorial
regret
now
thought
helen
when
her
glance
fell
on
the
bulky
envelops
my
name
will
at
least
become
known
and
editors
very
much
resemble
the
public
they
cater
for
if
a
writer
achieves
success
they
all
want
him
i
have
often
marveled
how
any
author
got
his
first
chance
now
i
know
it
comes
this
way
like
a
flash
of
lightning
from
a
summer
sky
it
was
only
fit
and
proper
that
she
should
magnify
her
first
real
commission
no
veteran
soldier
ever
donned
a
field
marshal
uniform
with
the
same
zest
that
he
displayed
when
his
subaltern
outfit
came
from
the
tailor
so
helen
glowed
with
that
serious
enthusiasm
which
is
the
soul
of
genius
for
without
it
life
becomes
flat
and
gray
and
she
passed
many
anxious
hours
until
a
courteous
bank
official
handed
her
a
packet
at
the
appointed
time
on
monday
and
gave
her
a
receipt
to
sign
and
asked
her
how
she
would
take
her
hundred
pounds
did
she
want
it
all
in
notes
or
some
in
gold
she
was
so
unnerved
by
this
sudden
confirmation
of
her
good
fortune
that
she
stammered
confusedly
i
really
do
know
well
it
would
be
rather
heavy
in
gold
came
the
smiling
comment
this
money
i
understand
is
paid
to
you
for
some
journalistic
enterprise
that
will
take
you
abroad
may
i
suggest
that
you
should
carry
say
thirty
pounds
in
notes
and
ten
in
gold
and
allow
me
to
give
you
the
balance
in
the
form
of
circular
notes
which
are
payable
only
under
your
signature
yes
said
helen
rosy
red
at
her
own
awkwardness
that
will
be
very
nice
the
official
pushed
across
the
counter
some
banknotes
and
sovereigns
and
summoned
a
commissionaire
to
usher
her
into
the
waiting
room
till
he
had
prepared
the
circular
notes
the
respite
was
a
blessing
it
gave
helen
time
to
recover
her
self
possession
she
opened
the
packet
and
found
therein
coupons
for
the
journey
to
and
from
moritz
together
with
a
letter
from
the
sleeping
car
company
from
which
she
gathered
that
a
berth
on
the
engadine
express
was
provisionally
reserved
in
her
name
for
the
following
thursday
but
any
change
to
a
later
date
must
be
made
forthwith
as
the
holiday
pressure
was
beginning
it
was
advisable
too
she
was
reminded
that
she
should
secure
her
return
berth
before
leaving
london
each
moment
the
reality
of
the
tour
became
more
patent
she
might
feel
herself
bewitched
but
pounds
sterling
and
railway
tickets
were
tangible
things
and
not
to
be
explained
away
by
any
fantasy
by
the
time
her
additional
wealth
was
ready
she
was
better
fitted
to
guard
it
she
hurried
away
quite
unconscious
of
the
admiring
eyes
that
were
raised
from
dockets
and
ledgers
behind
the
grille
she
made
for
the
court
in
which
the
firefly
had
its
abode
the
squalor
of
the
passage
the
poverty
stricken
aspect
of
the
stairs
items
which
had
prepared
her
on
other
occasions
for
the
starvation
rate
of
pay
offered
for
her
work
now
passed
unheeded
this
affectation
of
scanty
means
was
humorous
obviously
some
millionaire
had
secured
what
the
newspapers
called
a
controlling
interest
in
the
firefly
she
sought
mackenzie
the
editor
and
he
received
her
with
a
manifest
reluctance
to
waste
his
precious
time
over
details
that
was
almost
as
convincing
as
the
money
and
vouchers
she
carried
yes
thursday
will
suit
admirably
he
said
in
reply
to
her
breathless
questions
you
will
reach
maloja
on
friday
evening
and
if
you
post
the
first
article
that
day
week
it
will
arrive
in
good
time
for
the
next
number
as
for
the
style
and
tone
i
leave
those
considerations
entirely
to
you
so
long
as
the
matter
is
bright
and
readable
that
is
all
i
want
i
put
my
requirements
clearly
in
my
letter
follow
that
and
you
can
not
make
any
mistake
helen
little
realized
how
precise
were
the
instructions
given
two
hours
earlier
to
the
editor
the
bank
clerk
and
the
sleeping
car
company
mackenzie
curt
acceptance
of
her
mission
brought
a
wondering
cry
to
her
lips
i
am
naturally
overjoyed
at
my
selection
for
this
work
she
said
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
think
of
me
oh
it
is
hard
to
say
how
these
things
are
determined
he
answered
we
liked
your
crisp
way
of
putting
dull
facts
i
suppose
and
thought
that
a
young
lady
impressions
of
life
in
an
summer
community
would
be
fresher
and
more
attractive
than
a
man
that
is
all
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
experiences
but
please
i
want
to
thank
you
not
a
word
business
is
business
you
know
if
a
thing
is
worth
doing
it
must
be
done
well
he
flattered
himself
that
he
could
spend
another
man
money
with
as
lordly
an
air
as
the
youngest
journalist
on
the
difficulty
was
to
find
the
man
with
the
money
and
mackenzie
had
given
much
thought
during
the
sabbath
to
the
potentialities
that
lay
behind
spencer
whim
he
was
sure
the
incident
would
not
close
with
the
publication
of
miss
wynton
articles
judiciously
handled
her
unknown
benefactor
might
prove
equally
beneficial
to
the
firefly
so
helen
tripped
out
into
and
turned
her
pretty
face
westward
and
looked
so
eager
and
happy
that
it
is
not
surprising
if
many
a
man
eyed
her
as
she
passed
and
many
a
woman
sighed
to
think
that
another
woman
could
find
life
in
this
dreary
city
such
a
joyous
thing
a
sharp
walk
through
the
strand
and
across
trafalgar
square
did
a
good
deal
toward
restoring
the
poise
of
her
wits
for
safety
she
had
pinned
the
envelop
containing
her
paper
money
and
tickets
inside
her
blouse
the
mere
presence
of
the
solid
little
parcel
reminded
her
at
every
movement
that
she
was
truly
bound
for
the
wonderful
engadine
and
now
that
the
notion
was
becoming
familiar
she
was
the
more
astonished
that
the
choice
of
the
firefly
had
fallen
on
her
it
was
all
very
well
for
mackenzie
to
say
that
the
paper
would
be
brightened
by
a
woman
views
on
life
in
the
high
alps
the
poor
worn
man
looked
as
if
such
a
holiday
would
have
done
him
a
world
of
good
but
the
certain
fact
remained
that
there
was
no
room
for
error
it
was
she
helen
wynton
and
none
other
for
whom
the
gods
had
contrived
this
miracle
if
it
had
been
possible
she
would
have
crossed
busy
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
in
order
to
gain
the
sleeping
car
company
premises
she
knew
the
place
well
many
a
time
had
she
looked
at
the
attractive
posters
in
the
windows
those
gorgeous
fly
sheets
that
told
of
winter
in
summer
among
the
mountains
of
switzerland
and
the
tyrol
and
of
summer
in
winter
along
the
sunlit
shores
of
the
côte
she
almost
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
that
possessed
her
as
she
waited
for
a
moment
on
the
curb
to
allow
a
press
of
traffic
to
pass
if
my
luck
holds
till
christmas
i
may
be
sent
to
monte
carlo
she
said
to
herself
and
why
not
it
the
first
step
that
counts
and
firefly
once
fairly
embarked
on
a
career
of
wild
extravagance
may
keep
it
up
under
the
pressure
of
that
further
inspiration
she
refused
to
wait
any
longer
but
dodged
an
omnibus
a
motor
car
and
some
hansoms
and
pushed
open
the
swing
doors
of
the
bureau
de
la
campagnie
des
she
did
not
notice
that
the
automobile
stopped
very
quickly
a
few
yards
higher
up
the
street
the
occupant
mark
bower
alighted
looked
at
her
through
the
window
to
make
sure
he
was
not
mistaken
and
followed
her
into
the
building
he
addressed
some
question
to
an
attendant
and
heard
helen
say
yes
please
thursday
will
suit
admirably
i
am
going
straight
through
to
moritz
i
shall
call
on
wednesday
and
let
you
know
what
day
i
wish
to
return
if
bower
had
intended
to
speak
to
her
he
seemed
to
change
his
mind
rather
promptly
helen
back
was
turned
she
was
watching
a
clerk
writing
out
a
voucher
for
her
berth
in
the
sleeping
car
and
the
office
was
full
of
other
prospective
travelers
discussing
times
and
routes
with
the
officials
bower
thanked
his
informant
for
information
which
he
could
have
supplied
in
ampler
detail
himself
then
he
went
out
and
looked
again
at
helen
from
the
doorway
but
she
was
wholly
unaware
of
his
presence
thus
it
came
about
quite
simply
and
naturally
that
mark
bower
met
miss
helen
wynton
on
the
platform
of
victoria
station
on
thursday
morning
and
learned
that
like
himself
she
was
a
passenger
by
the
engadine
express
he
took
her
presence
as
a
matter
of
course
hoped
she
would
allow
him
to
secure
her
a
comfortable
chair
on
the
steamer
told
her
that
the
weather
report
was
excellent
and
remarked
that
they
might
expect
a
pleasant
crossing
in
the
new
turbine
steamer
illustration
i
am
going
through
to
st
moritz
then
having
ascertained
that
she
had
a
corner
seat
and
that
her
luggage
was
registered
through
to
moritz
helen
having
arrived
at
the
station
a
good
hour
before
the
train
was
due
to
start
he
bowed
himself
away
being
far
too
skilled
a
stalker
of
such
shy
game
to
thrust
his
company
on
her
at
that
stage
his
attitude
was
very
polite
and
friendly
and
helen
was
almost
grateful
to
the
chance
which
had
brought
him
there
she
was
feeling
just
a
trifle
lonely
in
the
midst
of
the
gay
and
chattering
throng
that
crowded
the
station
the
presence
of
one
who
was
not
wholly
a
stranger
of
a
friend
friend
of
a
man
whose
name
was
familiar
made
the
journey
look
less
dreamlike
she
was
glad
he
had
not
sought
to
travel
in
her
carriage
that
was
tactful
and
indeed
his
courtesy
and
pleasant
words
during
her
first
brief
meeting
with
him
in
the
embankment
hotel
had
conveyed
the
same
favorable
impression
so
when
the
hour
hand
of
the
big
clock
overhanging
the
center
of
the
platform
pointed
to
eleven
the
long
train
glided
quietly
away
with
its
load
of
and
neither
helen
nor
her
new
acquaintance
could
possibly
know
that
their
meeting
had
been
witnessed
with
a
blank
amazement
that
was
rapidly
transmuted
into
sheer
annoyance
by
a
young
american
engineer
named
charles
spencer
chapter
iii
wherein
two
people
become
better
acquainted
mackenzie
of
course
was
aware
that
miss
wynton
would
leave
london
by
the
eleven
train
on
thursday
and
spencer
saw
no
harm
in
witnessing
her
departure
he
found
a
good
deal
of
quiet
fun
in
noting
her
animated
expression
and
businesslike
air
her
enjoyment
of
novel
surroundings
was
an
asset
for
the
outlay
of
his
two
hundred
pounds
and
he
had
fully
and
finally
excused
that
piece
of
extravagance
until
he
caught
sight
of
bower
strolling
along
the
platform
with
the
easy
confidence
of
one
who
knew
exactly
whom
he
would
meet
and
how
he
would
account
for
his
unbidden
presence
spencer
at
once
suspected
the
man
motives
not
without
fair
cause
they
were
he
thought
as
plain
to
him
as
they
were
hidden
from
the
girl
bower
counterfeited
the
genuine
surprise
on
helen
face
with
admirable
skill
but
to
the
startled
onlooker
peering
beneath
the
actor
mask
his
stagy
artifice
was
laid
bare
and
spencer
was
quite
helpless
a
condition
that
irritated
him
almost
beyond
control
he
had
absolutely
no
grounds
for
interference
he
could
only
glower
angrily
and
in
silence
at
a
meeting
he
could
not
prevent
conjecture
might
run
riot
as
to
the
causes
which
had
given
this
sinister
bend
to
an
idyl
but
perforce
he
must
remain
dumb
from
one
point
of
view
it
was
lucky
that
helen
self
appointed
godfather
was
in
a
position
not
to
misjudge
her
from
another
it
would
have
been
better
for
spencer
peace
of
mind
were
he
left
in
ignorance
of
the
trap
that
was
apparently
being
laid
for
her
perhaps
fate
had
planned
this
thing
having
lately
smiled
on
the
american
she
may
have
determined
to
plague
him
somewhat
at
any
rate
in
that
instant
the
whole
trend
of
his
purpose
took
a
new
turn
from
a
general
belief
that
he
would
never
again
set
eyes
on
one
in
whose
fortunes
he
felt
a
transient
interest
his
intent
swerved
to
a
fixed
resolve
to
protect
her
from
bower
it
would
have
puzzled
him
to
assign
a
motive
for
his
dislike
of
the
man
but
the
feeling
was
there
strong
and
active
it
even
gave
him
a
certain
satisfaction
to
remember
that
he
was
hostile
to
bower
before
he
had
seen
him
indeed
he
nearly
yielded
to
the
momentary
impulse
that
bade
him
hasten
to
the
booking
office
and
secure
a
ticket
for
moritz
forthwith
he
dismissed
the
notion
as
quixotic
and
unnecessary
bower
attitude
in
not
pressing
his
company
on
miss
wynton
at
this
initial
stage
of
the
journey
revealed
a
subtlety
that
demanded
equal
restraint
on
spencer
part
helen
herself
was
so
far
from
suspecting
the
truth
that
bower
would
be
compelled
to
keep
up
the
pretense
of
a
casual
rencontre
nevertheless
spencer
chivalric
nature
was
stirred
to
the
depths
the
conversation
overheard
in
the
embankment
hotel
had
given
him
a
knowledge
of
the
characteristics
of
two
women
that
would
have
amazed
both
of
them
were
they
told
of
it
he
was
able
to
measure
too
the
exact
extent
of
bower
acquaintance
with
helen
while
he
was
confident
that
the
relationship
between
bower
and
millicent
jaques
had
gone
a
great
deal
further
than
might
be
inferred
from
the
curt
statement
that
he
was
one
whom
she
wished
to
avoid
these
two
extremes
could
be
reconciled
only
by
a
most
unfavorable
estimate
of
bower
and
that
the
american
conceded
without
argument
of
course
there
remained
the
possibility
that
bower
was
really
a
traveler
that
day
by
idle
chance
but
spencer
blew
aside
this
alternative
with
the
first
whiff
of
smoke
from
the
cigar
he
lit
mechanically
as
soon
as
the
train
left
the
station
no
he
said
in
grim
self
communing
the
skunk
found
out
somehow
that
she
was
going
abroad
and
planned
to
accompany
her
i
could
see
it
in
the
smirk
on
his
face
as
soon
as
he
discovered
her
whereabouts
on
the
platform
if
he
means
to
summer
at
maloja
i
guess
my
thousand
dollars
was
expended
to
no
good
purpose
and
the
quicker
i
put
up
another
thousand
to
pull
things
straight
the
happier
i
shall
be
and
let
me
tell
you
mother
that
if
i
get
helen
through
this
business
well
and
happy
i
shall
quit
fooling
round
as
godfather
or
stage
uncle
or
any
other
sort
of
idiot
meanwhile
bower
has
jumped
my
claim
his
glance
happened
to
fall
on
an
official
with
the
legend
ticket
inspector
on
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
remembered
that
this
man
or
some
other
closely
resembling
him
had
visited
the
carriage
in
which
bower
traveled
say
he
cried
hailing
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
when
does
the
next
train
leave
for
st
moritz
at
from
charing
cross
sir
but
the
engadine
express
is
the
best
one
did
you
miss
it
no
i
just
blew
in
here
to
see
a
friend
off
and
the
trip
kind
of
appealed
to
me
did
you
notice
a
reserved
compartment
for
a
mark
bower
i
know
bower
very
well
sir
he
goes
to
paris
or
vienna
twenty
times
a
year
he
is
going
to
switzerland
so
he
is
to
zurich
i
think
first
single
he
had
but
he
sure
to
bring
up
in
vienna
or
frankfort
i
wish
i
knew
half
what
he
knows
about
foreign
money
business
i
should
be
punching
tickets
here
very
long
thank
you
sir
charing
cross
at
but
you
may
have
difficulty
about
booking
a
berth
in
the
sleeper
just
now
everybody
is
crossing
the
channel
it
looks
like
that
said
spencer
who
had
obtained
the
information
he
wanted
taking
a
cab
he
drove
to
the
sleeping
car
office
where
he
asked
for
a
map
of
the
swiss
railways
zurich
as
bower
destination
puzzled
him
but
he
did
not
falter
in
his
purpose
the
man
is
a
rogue
he
thought
or
i
have
never
seen
one
anyhow
a
night
in
the
train
does
cut
any
ice
and
switzerland
can
fill
the
bill
for
a
week
as
well
as
london
or
scotland
he
was
fortunate
in
the
fact
that
some
person
wished
to
postpone
a
journey
that
day
and
the
accident
assured
him
of
comfortable
quarters
from
calais
onward
then
he
drove
to
a
bank
and
to
the
firefly
office
mackenzie
had
just
opened
his
second
bottle
of
beer
by
this
time
he
regarded
spencer
as
an
amiable
lunatic
he
greeted
him
now
with
as
much
glee
as
his
dreary
nature
was
capable
of
hello
he
said
been
to
see
the
last
of
the
lady
not
quite
i
want
to
take
back
what
i
said
about
not
going
to
switzerland
i
following
this
afternoon
great
scott
you
sudden
i
built
that
way
said
spencer
dryly
here
are
the
sixty
pounds
i
promised
you
now
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
send
a
messenger
to
the
wellington
theater
with
a
note
for
miss
millicent
jaques
and
ask
her
if
she
can
oblige
you
with
the
present
address
of
miss
helen
wynton
make
a
pretext
of
work
no
matter
if
she
writes
to
her
friend
and
the
inquiry
leads
to
talk
you
can
put
up
a
suitable
fairy
tale
i
have
no
doubt
better
still
let
my
assistant
write
then
if
necessary
i
can
curse
him
for
not
minding
his
own
business
but
what
in
the
wind
i
wish
to
find
out
whether
or
not
miss
jaques
knows
of
this
swiss
journey
that
is
all
if
the
reply
reaches
you
by
one
send
it
to
the
embankment
hotel
otherwise
post
it
to
me
at
the
kursaal
but
not
in
an
office
envelop
you
come
back
mr
spencer
said
the
editor
plaintively
for
he
had
visions
of
persuading
the
eccentric
american
to
start
a
magazine
of
his
own
oh
yes
you
probably
see
me
again
within
six
days
i
look
in
and
report
progress
good
by
a
messenger
caught
him
as
he
was
leaving
the
hotel
mackenzie
had
not
lost
any
time
and
miss
jaques
happened
to
be
at
the
theater
sorry
she
wrote
in
the
artistic
script
that
looks
so
well
in
face
cream
and
soap
advertisements
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
remember
the
number
but
miss
wynton
lives
somewhere
in
warburton
gardens
the
signature
millicent
jaques
was
an
elegant
thing
in
itself
carefully
thought
out
and
never
hurried
in
execution
no
matter
how
pressed
she
might
be
for
time
spencer
was
on
the
point
of
scattering
the
note
in
little
pieces
along
the
strand
but
he
checked
himself
guess
i
keep
this
as
a
souvenir
he
said
and
it
found
a
place
in
his
pocketbook
helen
wynton
having
crossed
the
channel
many
times
during
her
childhood
was
no
novice
amid
the
bustle
and
crush
on
the
narrow
pier
at
dover
she
had
dispensed
with
all
accessories
for
the
journey
except
the
few
articles
that
could
be
crammed
into
a
handbag
thus
being
independent
of
porters
she
was
one
of
the
first
to
reach
the
steamer
gangway
as
usual
all
the
most
sheltered
nooks
on
board
were
occupied
there
seems
to
be
a
mysterious
type
of
traveler
who
inhabits
the
vessels
permanently
no
matter
how
speedy
may
be
the
movements
of
a
passenger
by
the
either
at
dover
or
calais
the
best
seats
on
the
upper
deck
invariably
reveal
the
presence
of
earlier
arrivals
by
deposits
of
wraps
and
packages
this
phenomenon
was
not
strange
to
helen
a
more
baffling
circumstance
was
the
altered
shape
of
the
ship
the
familiar
lines
of
the
paddle
steamer
were
gone
and
helen
was
wondering
where
she
might
best
bestow
herself
and
her
tiny
valise
when
she
heard
bower
voice
i
took
the
precaution
to
telegraph
from
london
to
one
of
the
officers
he
said
and
nodded
toward
a
couple
of
waterproof
rugs
which
guarded
a
recess
behind
the
captain
cabin
that
is
our
corner
i
expect
my
friend
will
be
here
in
a
moment
sure
enough
a
man
in
uniform
approached
and
lifted
his
gold
laced
cap
we
have
a
rather
crowded
ship
bower
he
said
but
you
will
be
quite
comfortable
there
i
suppose
you
deemed
the
weather
too
fine
to
need
your
usual
cabin
yes
i
have
a
companion
you
see
helen
was
a
little
bewildered
by
this
but
it
was
very
pleasant
to
claim
undisputed
possession
of
a
quiet
retreat
from
which
to
watch
others
trying
to
find
chairs
and
although
bower
had
a
place
reserved
by
her
side
he
did
not
sit
down
he
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
on
such
eminently
safe
topics
as
the
smooth
sea
the
superiority
of
turbine
engines
in
the
matter
of
steadiness
the
advisability
of
lunching
in
the
train
after
leaving
calais
rather
than
on
board
the
ship
and
soon
betook
himself
aft
there
to
smoke
and
chat
with
some
acquaintances
whom
he
fell
in
with
dover
castle
was
becoming
a
gray
blur
on
the
horizon
when
he
spoke
to
helen
again
you
look
quite
comfortable
he
said
pleasantly
and
it
is
wise
not
to
risk
walking
about
if
you
are
afraid
of
being
i
used
to
cross
in
bad
weather
without
consequences
she
answered
but
i
am
older
now
and
am
doubtful
of
experiments
you
were
educated
abroad
then
yes
i
was
three
years
in
brussels
three
happy
years
ah
why
qualify
them
all
your
years
are
happy
i
should
imagine
if
i
may
judge
by
appearances
well
if
happiness
can
be
defined
as
contentment
you
are
right
but
i
have
had
my
sad
periods
too
bower
i
lost
my
mother
when
i
was
eighteen
and
that
was
a
blow
under
which
i
have
never
ceased
to
wince
fortunately
i
had
to
seek
consolation
in
work
added
to
good
health
it
makes
for
content
you
are
quite
a
philosopher
will
you
pardon
my
curiosity
i
too
lead
the
strenuous
life
now
i
should
like
to
have
your
definition
of
work
i
am
not
questioning
your
capacity
my
wonder
is
that
you
should
mention
it
at
all
but
why
any
man
who
knows
what
toil
is
should
not
regard
women
as
dolls
i
prefer
to
look
on
them
as
goddesses
helen
smiled
i
fear
then
you
will
deem
my
pedestal
a
sorry
one
she
said
perhaps
you
think
because
you
met
me
once
in
miss
company
and
again
here
traveling
that
i
am
in
her
set
i
am
not
by
courtesy
i
am
called
a
but
the
title
might
be
shortened
into
i
help
professor
von
eulenberg
with
his
scientific
researches
though
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
say
beetles
she
substituted
the
more
dignified
phrase
bower
was
very
nice
and
kind
but
she
felt
that
beetles
might
sound
somewhat
flippant
and
lend
a
too
familiar
tone
to
their
conversation
von
eulenberg
i
have
heard
of
him
quite
a
distinguished
man
in
his
own
line
an
authority
on
moths
is
it
insects
generally
she
blushed
and
laughed
outright
not
only
at
the
boomerang
effect
of
her
grandiloquent
description
of
the
professor
industry
but
at
the
absurdity
of
her
position
above
all
else
helen
was
candid
and
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
enlighten
a
comparative
stranger
who
seemed
to
take
a
friendly
interest
in
her
i
ought
to
explain
she
went
on
that
i
am
going
to
the
engadine
as
a
journalist
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
chosen
for
a
very
pleasant
task
hence
this
present
grandeur
which
i
assure
you
is
not
a
usual
condition
of
entomological
secretaries
bower
pretended
to
ward
off
some
unexpected
attack
i
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
a
hard
word
like
that
miss
wynton
he
cried
i
shall
not
recover
till
we
reach
calais
may
i
sit
beside
you
while
you
tell
me
what
it
means
she
made
room
for
him
strictly
speaking
it
is
nonsense
she
said
excellent
that
is
the
better
line
for
women
who
are
young
and
pretty
we
jaded
men
of
the
world
hate
to
be
serious
when
we
leave
business
behind
now
you
would
scarce
credit
what
a
lively
youngster
i
am
when
i
come
abroad
for
a
holiday
i
always
kiss
my
fingers
to
france
at
the
first
sight
of
her
fair
face
she
bubbles
like
her
own
champagne
whereas
london
invariably
reminds
me
of
beer
do
i
take
it
that
you
prefer
gas
to
froth
you
offer
me
difficult
alternatives
yet
i
accept
them
though
gas
is
as
dreadful
a
description
of
champagne
as
entomological
is
of
a
certain
type
of
secretary
i
would
venture
to
point
out
that
it
expands
effervesces
soars
ever
to
greater
heights
but
beer
froth
and
all
tends
to
become
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
i
assure
you
my
knowledge
of
both
is
limited
i
had
never
even
tasted
champagne
until
the
other
day
when
you
lunched
with
millicent
at
the
embankment
hotel
well
yes
she
was
at
school
with
me
and
we
met
last
week
by
accident
she
is
making
quite
a
success
at
the
wellington
theater
is
she
not
so
i
hear
i
am
a
director
of
that
concern
but
i
seldom
go
there
how
odd
that
sounds
to
one
who
saves
up
her
pennies
to
attend
a
favorite
play
then
you
must
have
my
address
and
when
i
am
in
town
you
need
never
want
a
stall
at
any
theater
in
london
now
that
is
no
idle
promise
i
mean
it
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
think
you
were
enjoying
something
through
my
instrumentality
how
exceedingly
kind
of
you
i
shall
take
you
at
your
word
what
girl
would
i
know
quite
a
number
who
regard
me
as
an
ogre
i
am
not
a
lady
man
in
the
general
sense
of
the
term
miss
wynton
i
might
tell
you
more
about
myself
if
it
were
not
for
signs
that
the
next
five
minutes
will
bring
us
to
calais
you
are
far
too
independent
i
suppose
that
i
should
offer
to
carry
your
bag
but
will
you
allow
me
to
reserve
a
joint
table
for
there
will
be
a
rush
for
the
first
service
which
is
the
best
as
a
rule
and
i
have
friends
at
court
on
this
line
please
do
say
you
are
not
hungry
that
would
be
impolite
and
horribly
untrue
laughed
helen
he
took
the
implied
permission
and
hurried
away
they
did
not
meet
again
until
he
came
to
her
carriage
in
the
train
is
this
where
you
are
he
cried
looking
up
at
her
through
the
open
window
i
am
in
the
next
block
as
they
say
in
america
when
you
are
ready
i
shall
take
you
to
the
dining
car
come
out
on
the
platform
the
corridors
are
simply
impassable
and
here
are
baskets
of
peaches
and
ripe
pears
and
all
manner
of
pleasant
fruits
yes
try
the
corridor
to
the
right
and
charge
resolutely
if
you
inflict
the
maximum
injury
on
others
you
seldom
damage
yourself
in
a
word
mark
bower
spoke
as
lightheartedly
as
he
professed
to
feel
and
helen
had
no
cause
whatever
to
be
other
than
thankful
for
the
chance
that
brought
him
to
switzerland
on
the
same
day
and
in
the
same
train
as
herself
his
delicate
consideration
for
her
well
being
was
manifested
in
many
ways
that
such
a
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
figure
of
importance
in
the
financial
world
should
take
an
interest
in
the
simple
chronicles
of
her
past
life
was
a
flattering
thing
in
itself
he
listened
sympathetically
to
the
story
of
her
struggles
since
the
death
of
her
mother
the
consequent
stoppage
of
the
annuity
paid
to
the
widow
of
an
indian
civilian
rendered
it
necessary
that
helen
should
supplement
by
her
own
efforts
the
fifty
pounds
a
year
allotted
to
her
until
death
or
marriage
there
are
plenty
of
country
districts
where
i
could
exist
quite
easily
on
such
a
sum
she
said
but
i
declined
to
be
buried
alive
in
that
fashion
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
earn
my
own
living
somehow
london
appeals
to
young
people
situated
as
i
was
it
is
there
that
the
great
prizes
are
to
be
gained
so
i
came
to
london
from
broke
in
bower
who
was
peeling
one
of
the
peaches
bought
at
calais
from
a
village
near
sheringham
in
norfolk
he
nodded
with
smiling
comprehension
when
she
detailed
her
struggles
with
editors
who
could
detect
no
originality
in
her
literary
work
but
that
phase
has
passed
now
he
said
encouragingly
well
it
looks
like
it
i
hope
so
for
i
am
tired
of
classifying
beetles
there
the
word
was
out
at
last
perhaps
bower
wondered
why
she
laughed
and
blushed
at
the
recollection
of
her
earlier
determination
to
suppress
von
eulenberg
specimens
as
a
topic
of
conversation
already
the
stiffness
of
their
talk
on
board
the
steamship
seemed
to
have
vanished
completely
it
was
really
a
pleasant
way
of
passing
the
time
to
sit
and
chat
in
this
glass
palace
while
the
train
skimmed
over
a
dull
land
of
marshes
and
poplars
beetles
though
apt
to
be
flighty
are
otherwise
dull
creatures
he
said
may
i
ask
what
paper
you
are
representing
on
your
present
tour
it
was
an
obvious
and
harmless
question
but
helen
was
loyal
to
her
bond
it
sounds
absurd
to
have
to
say
it
but
i
am
pledged
to
secrecy
she
answered
good
gracious
do
tell
me
you
intend
to
interview
anarchists
or
runaway
queens
or
the
other
disgruntled
people
who
live
in
switzerland
moreover
they
usually
find
quarters
in
geneva
while
you
presumably
are
bound
for
the
engadine
oh
no
my
work
lies
in
less
excitable
circles
in
a
swiss
hotel
would
be
nearer
the
mark
apart
from
the
unusual
surroundings
you
will
find
it
suspiciously
like
life
in
a
quiet
norfolk
village
miss
wynton
said
bower
he
paused
tasted
the
peach
and
made
a
grimace
sour
he
protested
really
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
only
place
in
which
one
can
buy
a
decent
peach
is
london
ah
a
distinct
score
for
britain
and
a
fair
hit
to
your
credit
let
me
urge
in
self
defense
that
if
life
in
france
bubbles
it
occasionally
leaves
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
now
you
shall
go
and
read
and
sleep
a
little
perhaps
if
that
is
not
a
heretical
thing
to
suggest
we
have
the
same
table
for
afternoon
tea
and
dinner
helen
had
never
met
such
a
versatile
man
he
talked
of
most
things
with
knowledge
and
restraint
and
some
humor
she
could
not
help
admitting
that
the
journey
would
have
been
exceedingly
dull
without
his
companionship
and
he
had
the
tact
to
make
her
feel
that
he
was
equally
indebted
to
her
for
passing
the
long
hours
at
dinner
she
noticed
that
they
were
served
with
dishes
not
supplied
to
others
in
the
dining
car
i
hope
you
have
not
been
ordering
a
dreadfully
expensive
meal
she
ventured
to
say
i
must
pay
my
share
you
know
and
i
am
quite
an
economical
person
there
he
vowed
that
is
the
first
unkind
word
you
have
uttered
surely
you
will
not
refuse
to
be
my
guest
indeed
i
was
hoping
that
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
wherein
we
might
meet
at
times
and
criticize
humanity
to
our
hearts
content
i
should
feel
unhappy
if
i
did
not
pay
she
insisted
well
then
i
shall
charge
you
table
prices
will
that
content
you
so
when
the
attendant
came
to
the
other
tables
helen
produced
her
purse
and
bower
solemnly
accepted
her
few
francs
but
no
bill
was
presented
to
him
you
see
he
said
smiling
at
her
through
a
glass
of
golden
wine
you
have
missed
a
great
opportunity
not
one
woman
in
a
million
can
say
that
she
has
dined
at
the
railway
company
expense
in
france
she
was
puzzled
his
manner
had
become
slightly
more
confidential
during
the
meal
it
needed
no
feminine
intuition
to
realize
that
he
admired
her
excitement
the
sea
air
the
heated
atmosphere
and
unceasing
onrush
of
the
train
had
flushed
her
cheeks
and
lent
a
deeper
shade
to
her
brown
eyes
she
knew
that
bower
was
not
the
only
glance
that
dwelt
on
her
with
a
curious
and
somewhat
unnerving
appraisement
other
men
and
not
a
few
women
stared
at
her
the
mirror
in
her
dressing
room
had
told
her
that
she
was
looking
her
best
and
her
heart
fluttered
a
little
at
the
thought
that
she
had
succeeded
without
effort
in
winning
the
appreciation
of
a
man
highly
placed
in
the
world
of
fashion
and
finance
the
conceit
induced
an
odd
feeling
of
embarrassment
to
dispel
it
she
took
up
his
words
in
a
vein
of
playful
sarcasm
if
you
assure
me
that
for
some
unexplained
reason
the
railway
authorities
are
giving
us
this
excellent
dinner
for
nothing
please
return
my
money
she
said
the
gifts
of
the
gods
and
eke
of
railway
companies
must
be
taken
without
question
he
answered
no
i
shall
keep
your
pieces
of
silver
i
mean
to
invest
them
it
will
amuse
me
to
learn
how
much
i
can
make
on
an
initial
capital
of
twelve
francs
fifty
centimes
will
you
allow
that
i
shall
be
scrupulously
accurate
and
submit
an
audited
account
at
christmas
even
my
worst
enemies
have
never
alleged
dishonesty
against
me
is
it
a
bargain
she
stammered
confusedly
hardly
knowing
what
he
meant
he
was
leaning
over
the
small
table
and
looking
steadfastly
at
her
she
noticed
that
the
wine
and
food
had
made
his
skin
greasy
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
mark
bower
resembled
certain
exotic
plants
which
must
be
viewed
from
a
distance
if
they
would
gratify
the
critical
senses
the
gloss
of
a
careful
toilet
was
gone
he
was
altogether
cruder
coarser
more
animal
since
he
had
eaten
though
his
consumption
of
wine
was
quite
moderate
his
big
rather
fierce
eyes
were
more
than
prominent
now
they
bulged
certain
jewish
characteristics
in
his
face
had
become
accentuated
she
remembered
the
ancient
habit
of
anointing
with
oil
and
laughed
at
the
thought
for
that
was
a
little
trick
of
hers
to
conceal
nervousness
you
doubt
me
then
he
half
whispered
or
do
you
deem
it
beyond
the
power
of
finance
to
convert
so
small
a
sum
into
hundreds
it
may
be
thousands
of
pounds
in
six
months
indeed
i
should
credit
you
with
ability
to
do
that
and
more
bower
she
said
but
i
was
wondering
why
you
made
such
an
offer
to
a
mere
acquaintance
one
whom
it
is
more
than
likely
you
will
never
meet
again
the
phrase
had
a
harsh
and
awkward
sound
in
her
ears
bower
to
her
relief
seemed
to
ignore
it
it
is
permissible
to
gratify
an
impulse
once
in
awhile
he
countered
and
not
to
mention
the
audited
accounts
there
was
a
matter
of
theater
tickets
that
should
serve
to
bring
us
together
again
wo
you
give
me
your
address
in
london
if
not
in
switzerland
here
is
mine
he
produced
a
pocketbook
and
picked
out
a
card
it
bore
his
name
and
his
club
he
added
in
pencil
hamilton
place
letters
sent
to
my
house
reach
me
no
matter
where
i
may
happen
to
be
he
said
the
incident
brought
fresh
tremors
to
helen
indeed
the
penciled
address
came
as
an
unpleasant
shock
for
millicent
jaques
on
the
day
they
met
in
piccadilly
having
gone
home
with
helen
to
tea
excused
an
early
departure
on
the
ground
that
she
was
due
to
dinner
at
that
very
house
but
she
took
the
card
and
strove
desperately
to
appear
at
ease
for
she
had
no
cause
to
quarrel
with
one
whose
manners
were
so
courteous
thank
you
very
much
she
said
if
you
care
to
see
my
articles
in
the
in
the
paper
i
shall
send
you
copies
now
i
must
say
good
by
i
am
rather
tired
before
i
go
let
me
say
how
deeply
indebted
i
feel
for
your
kindness
she
rose
bower
stood
up
too
and
bowed
with
smiling
deference
good
night
he
said
you
will
not
be
disturbed
by
the
customs
people
at
the
frontier
i
have
arranged
all
that
helen
made
the
best
of
her
way
along
the
swaying
corridors
till
she
reached
her
section
of
the
sleeping
car
but
bower
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
he
ordered
a
glass
of
fine
champagne
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
there
was
a
decided
frown
on
his
strong
face
and
the
attendant
who
served
him
imagined
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
liqueur
pas
bon
he
began
will
you
go
to
the
devil
said
bower
speaking
very
slowly
without
looking
at
him
je
vous
and
the
man
disappeared
it
was
not
the
wine
but
the
woman
that
was
perplexing
him
not
often
had
the
lure
of
gold
failed
so
signally
and
why
was
she
so
manifestly
startled
at
the
last
moment
had
he
gone
too
far
was
he
mistaken
in
the
assumption
that
millicent
jaques
had
said
little
or
nothing
concerning
him
to
her
friend
and
this
commission
too
there
were
inexplicable
features
about
it
he
knew
a
great
deal
of
the
ways
of
newspapers
daily
and
weekly
and
it
was
not
the
journalistic
habit
to
send
inexperienced
young
women
on
costly
journeys
to
write
up
swiss
summer
resorts
he
frowned
still
more
deeply
as
he
thought
of
the
hotel
for
helen
had
innocently
affixed
a
label
bearing
her
address
on
her
handbag
he
peopled
it
with
dozens
of
smart
young
men
and
not
a
few
older
beaux
of
his
own
type
his
features
relaxed
somewhat
when
he
remembered
the
women
helen
was
alone
and
far
too
to
command
sympathy
there
should
be
the
elements
of
trouble
in
that
quarter
if
he
played
his
cards
well
and
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
his
skill
helen
should
greet
him
as
her
best
friend
when
he
surprised
her
by
appearing
unexpectedly
at
the
then
he
waxed
critical
she
was
young
and
lively
and
unquestionably
pretty
but
was
she
worth
all
this
planning
and
contriving
she
was
by
way
of
being
a
prude
too
and
held
serious
notions
of
women
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
at
any
rate
the
day
hunting
had
not
brought
him
far
out
of
his
path
frankfort
being
his
real
objective
and
he
would
make
up
his
mind
later
perhaps
she
would
remove
all
obstacles
by
writing
to
him
on
her
return
to
london
but
the
recollection
of
her
frank
clear
gaze
of
lips
that
were
molded
for
strength
as
well
as
sweetness
of
the
dignity
and
grace
with
which
the
well
shaped
head
was
poised
on
a
white
firm
neck
warned
him
that
such
a
woman
might
surrender
to
love
but
never
to
greed
then
he
laughed
and
ordered
another
liqueur
and
drank
a
toast
to
when
all
things
come
to
pass
for
the
man
who
knows
how
to
contrive
in
the
early
morning
at
basle
he
awoke
and
was
somewhat
angry
with
himself
when
he
found
that
his
thoughts
still
dwelt
on
helen
wynton
in
the
cold
gray
glimmer
of
dawn
and
after
the
unpleasant
shaking
his
pampered
body
had
received
all
night
some
of
the
romance
of
this
latest
quest
had
evaporated
he
was
stiff
and
weary
and
he
regretted
the
whim
that
had
led
him
a
good
twelve
hours
astray
but
he
roused
himself
and
dressed
with
care
some
twenty
minutes
short
of
zurich
he
sent
an
attendant
to
miss
wynton
berth
to
inquire
if
she
would
join
him
for
early
coffee
at
that
station
there
being
a
wait
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
train
went
on
to
coire
helen
who
was
up
and
dressed
said
she
would
be
delighted
she
too
had
been
thinking
and
being
a
and
girl
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
abrupt
departure
the
previous
night
was
wholly
uncalled
for
and
ungracious
so
it
was
with
a
smiling
face
that
she
awaited
bower
on
the
steps
of
her
carriage
she
shook
hands
with
him
cordially
did
not
object
in
the
least
degree
when
he
seized
her
arm
to
pilot
her
through
a
noisy
crowd
of
foreigners
and
laughed
with
utmost
cheerfulness
when
they
both
failed
to
drink
some
extraordinarily
hot
coffee
served
in
glasses
that
seemed
to
be
hotter
still
helen
had
the
rare
distinction
of
being
quite
as
bright
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
in
the
searching
light
of
the
sun
first
rays
as
at
any
other
hour
bower
though
spruce
and
dandified
looked
rather
worn
i
did
not
sleep
well
he
explained
and
the
rails
to
the
frontier
on
this
line
are
the
worst
laid
in
europe
it
is
early
yet
she
said
why
not
turn
in
again
when
you
reach
your
hotel
perish
the
thought
he
cried
i
shall
wander
disconsolate
by
the
side
of
the
lake
please
say
you
will
miss
me
at
breakfast
and
by
the
way
you
will
find
a
table
specially
set
apart
for
you
i
suppose
you
change
at
coire
how
kind
and
thoughtful
you
are
yes
i
am
going
to
the
engadine
you
know
well
give
my
greetings
to
the
high
alps
i
have
climbed
most
of
them
in
my
time
more
improbable
things
have
happened
than
that
i
may
renew
the
acquaintance
with
some
of
my
old
friends
this
year
what
fun
if
you
and
i
met
on
the
matterhorn
or
jungfrau
but
they
are
far
away
from
the
valley
of
the
inn
and
perhaps
you
do
not
climb
i
have
never
had
the
opportunity
but
i
mean
to
try
moreover
it
is
part
of
my
undertaking
then
may
we
soon
be
tied
to
the
same
rope
thus
they
parted
with
cheery
words
and
on
helen
side
a
genuine
wish
that
they
might
renew
a
pleasant
acquaintance
bower
waited
on
the
platform
to
see
the
last
of
her
as
the
train
steamed
away
yes
it
is
worth
while
he
muttered
when
the
white
feathers
on
her
hat
were
no
longer
visible
he
did
not
go
to
the
lake
but
to
the
telegraph
office
and
there
he
wrote
two
long
messages
which
he
revised
carefully
and
copied
yet
he
frowned
again
even
while
he
was
paying
for
their
transmission
never
before
had
he
taken
such
pains
to
win
any
woman
regard
and
the
knowledge
vexed
him
for
the
taking
of
pains
was
not
his
way
with
women
chapter
iv
how
helen
came
to
maloja
at
coire
or
chur
as
the
swiss
often
term
it
german
being
the
language
most
in
vogue
in
switzerland
helen
found
a
cheerful
looking
mountain
train
awaiting
the
coming
of
its
heavy
brother
from
far
off
calais
it
was
soon
packed
to
the
doors
for
those
alpine
valleys
hum
with
life
and
movement
during
the
closing
days
of
july
even
in
the
first
class
carriages
nearly
every
seat
was
filled
in
a
few
minutes
while
pandemonium
reigned
in
the
cheaper
sections
helen
having
no
cumbersome
baggage
to
impede
her
movements
was
swept
in
on
the
crest
of
the
earliest
wave
and
obtained
a
corner
near
the
corridor
she
meant
to
leave
her
handbag
there
stroll
up
and
down
the
station
for
a
few
minutes
mainly
to
look
at
the
cosmopolitan
crowd
and
perhaps
buy
some
fruit
but
the
babel
of
english
german
french
and
italian
mixed
with
scraps
of
russian
and
czech
that
raged
round
a
distracted
conductor
warned
her
that
the
wiser
policy
was
to
sit
still
an
englishwoman
red
faced
elderly
and
important
was
offered
a
center
seat
facing
the
engine
in
helen
compartment
she
refused
it
her
indignation
was
magnificent
to
face
the
engine
she
declared
meant
instant
illness
i
never
return
to
this
wretched
country
that
i
do
not
regret
it
she
shrilled
have
you
no
telegraphs
can
not
your
officials
ascertain
from
zurich
how
many
english
passengers
may
be
expected
and
make
suitable
provision
for
them
as
this
tirade
was
thrown
away
on
the
conductor
she
proceeded
to
translate
it
into
fairly
accurate
french
but
the
man
was
at
his
wits
end
to
accommodate
the
throng
and
said
so
with
the
breathless
politeness
that
such
a
seemed
to
merit
then
you
should
set
apart
a
special
train
for
passengers
from
england
she
declared
vehemently
i
shall
never
come
here
again
never
the
place
is
overrun
with
cheap
tourists
moreover
i
shall
tell
all
my
friends
to
avoid
switzerland
perhaps
when
british
patronage
is
withdrawn
from
your
railways
and
hotels
you
will
begin
to
consider
our
requirements
helen
felt
that
her
irate
fellow
countrywoman
was
metaphorically
hurling
large
volumes
of
the
peerage
baronetage
and
landed
gentry
at
the
unhappy
conductor
head
again
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
seat
at
madam
service
when
the
train
started
he
would
do
his
best
to
secure
another
in
the
desired
position
as
the
woman
whose
proportions
were
generous
was
blocking
the
gangway
she
received
a
forcible
reminder
from
the
end
of
a
heavy
portmanteau
that
she
must
clear
out
of
the
way
breathing
dire
reprisals
on
the
swiss
federal
railway
system
she
entered
unwillingly
disgraceful
she
snorted
a
nation
of
boors
in
another
second
i
should
have
been
thrown
down
and
trampled
on
a
stolid
german
and
his
wife
occupied
opposite
corners
and
the
man
probably
wondered
why
the
glared
at
him
so
fiercely
but
he
did
not
move
helen
thinking
to
throw
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
said
pleasantly
wo
you
change
seats
with
me
i
do
mind
whether
i
face
the
engine
or
not
in
any
case
i
intend
to
stand
in
the
corridor
most
of
the
time
the
stout
woman
hearing
herself
addressed
in
english
lifted
her
mounted
eyeglasses
and
stared
at
helen
in
one
sweeping
glance
she
took
in
details
as
it
happened
the
girl
had
expended
fifteen
of
her
forty
pounds
on
a
neat
tailor
made
costume
a
smart
hat
well
fitting
gloves
and
the
best
pair
of
walking
boots
she
could
buy
for
having
pretty
feet
it
was
a
pardonable
vanity
that
she
should
wish
them
well
shod
apparently
the
other
was
satisfied
that
there
would
be
no
loss
of
caste
in
accepting
the
proffered
civility
thank
you
i
am
very
much
obliged
she
said
it
is
awfully
sweet
of
you
to
incommode
yourself
for
my
sake
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
woman
who
had
just
stormed
at
the
conductor
who
had
the
effrontery
to
subject
helen
to
that
stony
scrutiny
before
she
answered
could
adopt
such
dulcet
tones
so
suddenly
helen
frank
and
to
a
degree
would
have
preferred
a
gradual
subsidence
of
wrath
to
this
remarkable
but
she
reiterated
that
she
regarded
her
place
in
a
carriage
as
of
slight
consequence
and
the
change
was
effected
the
other
adjusted
her
eyeglasses
again
and
passed
in
review
the
remaining
occupants
of
the
compartment
they
were
foreigners
whose
existence
might
be
ignored
this
line
grows
worse
each
year
she
remarked
by
way
of
a
conversational
opening
it
is
horrid
traveling
alone
unfortunately
i
missed
my
son
at
lucerne
are
your
people
on
the
train
no
i
too
am
alone
ah
going
to
st
moritz
yes
but
i
take
the
diligence
there
for
maloja
the
diligence
who
in
the
world
advised
that
nobody
ever
travels
that
way
by
nobody
she
clearly
conveyed
the
idea
that
she
mixed
in
the
sacred
circle
of
somebodies
carriage
folk
to
the
soles
of
their
boots
because
helen
guidebook
showed
that
a
diligence
ran
twice
daily
through
the
upper
engadine
and
the
swiss
authorities
would
not
provide
those
capacious
vehicles
unless
there
were
passengers
to
fill
them
oh
cried
helen
should
i
have
ordered
a
carriage
beforehand
most
decidedly
but
your
friends
will
send
one
they
know
you
are
coming
by
this
train
helen
smiled
she
anticipated
a
certain
amount
of
cross
examination
at
the
hands
of
residents
in
the
hotel
but
she
saw
no
reason
why
the
ordeal
should
begin
so
soon
i
must
take
my
luck
then
she
said
there
ought
to
be
plenty
of
carriages
at
st
moritz
without
being
positively
rude
her
new
acquaintance
could
not
repeat
the
question
thus
shirked
but
she
had
other
shafts
in
her
quiver
you
will
stay
at
the
kursaal
of
course
she
said
yes
a
passing
visit
or
for
a
period
i
ask
because
i
am
going
there
myself
oh
how
nice
i
am
glad
i
have
met
you
i
mean
to
remain
at
maloja
until
the
end
of
august
quite
the
right
time
the
rest
of
switzerland
is
unbearable
in
august
you
will
find
the
hotel
rather
full
the
are
there
the
tennis
players
you
know
and
general
and
wragg
and
their
family
and
the
de
la
veres
nominally
husband
and
wife
a
most
charming
couple
individually
have
you
met
the
de
la
veres
no
well
do
be
unhappy
on
edith
account
if
reginald
flirts
with
you
she
likes
it
but
perhaps
i
might
not
like
it
laughed
helen
ah
reginald
has
such
fascinating
manners
a
sigh
seemed
to
deplore
the
days
of
long
ago
when
reginald
fascination
might
have
displayed
itself
on
her
account
again
there
was
a
break
in
the
flow
of
talk
and
helen
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
scenery
not
to
be
balked
her
inquisitor
searched
in
a
attached
to
her
left
wrist
with
a
strap
and
produced
a
card
we
may
as
well
know
each
other
names
she
cooed
affably
here
is
my
card
helen
read
de
courcy
vavasour
villa
menini
nice
i
am
sorry
she
said
with
a
friendly
smile
that
might
have
disarmed
prejudice
but
in
the
hurry
of
my
departure
from
london
i
packed
my
cards
in
my
registered
baggage
my
name
is
helen
wynton
the
eyeglasses
went
up
once
more
do
you
spell
it
with
an
i
are
you
one
of
the
gloucestershire
wintons
no
i
live
in
town
but
my
home
is
in
norfolk
and
whose
party
will
you
join
at
the
maloja
helen
colored
a
little
under
this
rigorous
heckling
as
i
have
already
told
you
vavasour
i
am
alone
she
said
indeed
i
have
come
here
to
to
do
some
literary
work
for
a
newspaper
yes
vavasour
received
this
statement
guardedly
if
helen
was
on
the
staff
of
an
important
journal
there
was
something
to
be
gained
by
being
cited
in
her
articles
as
one
of
the
important
persons
sojourning
in
the
engadine
it
is
really
wonderful
she
admitted
how
enterprising
the
great
daily
papers
are
nowadays
helen
very
new
to
a
world
of
de
courcy
vavasours
and
wraggs
and
forgave
this
hawklike
pertinacity
for
sake
of
the
apparent
sympathy
of
her
catechist
and
she
was
painfully
candid
the
weekly
paper
i
represent
is
not
at
all
well
known
she
explained
but
here
i
am
and
i
mean
to
enjoy
my
visit
hugely
it
is
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
to
be
sent
abroad
on
such
a
mission
i
little
dreamed
a
week
since
that
i
should
be
able
to
visit
this
beautiful
country
under
the
best
conditions
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
cost
poor
helen
had
she
delved
in
many
volumes
to
obtain
material
that
would
condemn
her
in
the
eyes
of
the
tuft
hunter
she
was
addressing
she
could
not
have
shocked
so
many
conventions
in
so
few
words
she
was
poor
unknown
unfriended
worse
than
these
negative
defects
she
was
positively
attractive
vavasour
almost
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
the
son
missed
at
lucerne
the
son
who
would
arrive
at
maloja
on
the
morrow
in
the
company
of
someone
whom
he
preferred
to
his
mother
as
a
fellow
traveler
what
a
pitfall
she
had
escaped
she
might
have
made
a
friend
of
this
impossible
person
nevertheless
rendered
wary
by
many
social
skirmishes
she
did
not
declare
war
at
once
the
girl
was
too
outspoken
to
be
an
adventuress
she
must
wait
and
watch
and
furbish
her
weapons
helen
whose
brain
was
nimble
enough
to
take
in
some
of
vavasour
limitations
hoped
that
the
preliminary
inquiry
into
her
caste
was
ended
she
went
into
the
corridor
a
man
made
room
for
her
with
an
alacrity
that
threatened
an
attempt
to
draw
her
into
conversation
so
she
moved
somewhat
farther
away
and
gave
herself
to
thought
if
this
prying
woman
was
a
fair
sample
of
the
people
in
the
hotel
it
was
obvious
that
the
human
element
in
the
high
alps
held
a
suspicious
resemblance
to
society
in
bayswater
where
each
street
is
a
faction
and
the
clique
in
the
terrace
is
not
on
speaking
terms
with
the
clique
in
the
gardens
thus
far
she
owned
to
a
feeling
of
disillusionment
in
many
respects
two
years
earlier
a
naturalist
in
the
highlands
had
engaged
von
eulenberg
to
classify
his
collection
and
helen
had
gone
to
inverness
with
the
professor
family
she
saw
something
then
of
the
glories
of
scotland
and
her
memories
of
the
purple
hills
the
silvery
lakes
the
joyous
burns
tumbling
headlong
through
woodland
and
pasture
were
not
dimmed
by
the
dusty
garishness
of
the
swiss
scenery
true
baedeker
said
that
these
pent
valleys
were
suffocating
in
midsummer
she
could
only
await
in
diminished
confidence
her
first
glimpse
of
the
eternal
snows
and
again
the
holiday
makers
were
not
the
blithesome
creatures
of
her
imagination
some
were
reading
many
sleeping
and
the
rest
for
the
most
part
talking
in
strange
tongues
of
anything
but
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
the
britons
among
them
seemed
to
be
brooding
on
glaciers
a
party
of
lively
americans
were
playing
bridge
and
a
scrap
of
gossip
in
english
from
a
neighboring
compartment
revealed
that
some
woman
who
went
to
a
dance
at
montreux
wore
a
cheap
voile
my
dear
a
last
year
bargain
all
crumpled
and
dirty
you
never
saw
such
a
fright
these
things
were
trivial
and
commonplace
a
wide
gap
opened
between
them
and
helen
day
dreams
of
alpine
travel
by
natural
sequence
of
ideas
she
began
to
contrast
her
present
loneliness
with
pleasant
journey
and
the
outcome
was
eminently
favorable
to
mark
bower
she
missed
him
she
was
quite
sure
had
he
accompanied
her
from
zurich
that
he
would
have
charmed
away
the
dull
hours
with
amusing
anecdotes
instead
of
feeling
rather
tired
and
sleepy
she
would
now
be
listening
to
his
apt
expositions
of
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
places
and
people
seen
from
the
carriage
windows
for
fully
five
minutes
her
expressive
mouth
betrayed
a
little
moue
of
disappointment
and
then
the
train
climbed
a
long
spiral
which
gave
a
series
of
delightful
views
of
a
picturesque
swiss
village
exactly
such
a
cluster
of
low
roofed
houses
as
she
had
admired
many
a
time
in
photographs
of
alpine
scenery
an
exclamation
from
a
little
boy
who
clapped
his
hands
in
ecstasy
caused
her
to
look
through
a
cleft
in
the
nearer
hills
with
a
thrill
of
wonder
she
discovered
there
remote
and
solitary
all
garbed
in
shining
white
a
majestic
snow
capped
mountain
ah
this
was
the
real
switzerland
her
heart
throbbed
and
her
breath
came
in
fluttering
gasps
of
excitement
how
mean
and
trivial
were
class
distinctions
in
sight
of
nature
nobility
she
was
uplifted
inspirited
filled
with
a
sedate
happiness
she
wanted
to
voice
her
gladness
as
the
child
had
done
a
high
pitched
female
voice
said
of
course
i
had
to
call
because
jack
meets
her
husband
in
the
city
but
it
is
an
awful
bore
knowing
such
people
then
the
train
plunged
into
a
noisome
tunnel
and
turned
a
complete
circle
in
the
heart
of
the
rock
and
when
it
panted
into
daylight
again
the
tall
square
tower
of
the
village
church
had
sunk
more
deeply
into
the
valley
far
beneath
two
bright
steel
ribbons
swallowed
by
a
cavernous
mouth
that
belched
clouds
of
dense
smoke
showed
the
strangeness
of
the
route
that
led
to
the
silent
peaks
at
times
the
rails
crossed
or
ran
by
the
side
of
a
white
tree
lined
track
that
mounted
ever
upward
though
she
could
not
recall
the
name
of
the
pass
helen
was
aware
that
this
was
one
of
the
fine
mountain
roads
for
which
switzerland
is
famous
pedestrians
singly
or
in
small
parties
were
trudging
along
sturdily
they
seemed
to
be
mostly
german
tourists
jolly
well
fed
folk
nearly
as
many
women
as
men
each
one
carrying
a
rucksack
and
alpenstock
and
evidently
determined
to
cover
a
set
number
of
kilometers
before
night
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
should
like
to
see
the
alps
thought
helen
i
am
sure
they
sing
as
they
walk
and
they
miss
nothing
of
the
grandeur
and
exquisite
coloring
of
the
hills
a
train
is
very
comfortable
but
it
certainly
brings
to
these
quiet
valleys
a
great
many
people
who
would
otherwise
never
come
near
them
the
force
of
this
trite
reflection
was
borne
in
on
her
by
a
loud
wrangle
between
the
bridge
players
a
woman
had
revoked
and
was
quite
wroth
with
the
man
who
detected
her
mistake
at
the
next
stopping
place
helen
bought
some
chocolates
and
made
a
friend
of
the
boy
a
tiny
parisian
the
two
found
amusement
in
searching
for
patches
of
snow
on
the
northerly
sides
of
the
nearest
hills
once
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
whole
snowy
range
and
they
shrieked
so
enthusiastically
that
the
woman
whose
husband
was
also
in
the
city
glanced
at
them
with
disapproval
as
they
interrupted
a
full
and
particular
if
not
true
account
of
the
quarrel
between
the
firs
and
the
limes
at
last
the
panting
engine
gathered
speed
and
rushed
along
a
wide
valley
into
samaden
celerina
and
moritz
vavasour
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
a
tauchnitz
novel
till
the
last
moment
and
the
next
sight
of
her
vouchsafed
to
helen
was
her
departure
from
the
terminus
in
solitary
state
in
a
victoria
it
savored
somewhat
of
unkindness
that
she
had
not
offered
to
share
the
roomy
vehicle
with
one
who
had
befriended
her
perhaps
she
was
afraid
i
might
not
pay
my
share
of
the
hire
said
helen
to
herself
rather
indignantly
but
a
civil
hotel
porter
helped
her
to
clear
the
customs
shed
rapidly
secured
a
comfortable
carriage
advised
her
confidentially
as
to
the
amount
that
should
be
paid
and
promised
to
telephone
to
the
hotel
for
a
suitable
room
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
many
of
her
fellow
passengers
were
bound
for
maloja
some
she
had
encountered
at
various
stages
of
the
journey
all
the
way
from
london
while
many
like
vavasour
had
joined
the
train
in
switzerland
she
remembered
too
with
a
quiet
humor
that
had
in
it
a
spice
of
sarcasm
that
her
elderly
acquaintance
had
not
come
from
england
and
had
no
more
right
to
demand
special
accommodation
at
coire
than
the
dozens
of
other
travelers
who
put
in
an
appearance
at
each
station
after
basle
she
noticed
that
as
soon
as
the
luggage
was
handed
to
the
driver
to
be
strapped
behind
each
vehicle
the
newcomers
nearly
all
went
to
a
neighboring
hotel
for
luncheon
being
a
healthy
young
person
and
endowed
with
a
sound
digestion
helen
deemed
this
example
too
good
not
to
be
followed
then
she
began
a
two
hours
drive
through
a
valley
that
almost
shook
her
allegiance
to
scotland
the
driver
a
fine
looking
old
man
with
massive
features
and
curling
gray
hair
that
reminded
her
of
michelangelo
head
of
moses
knowing
the
nationality
of
his
fare
resolutely
refused
to
speak
any
other
language
than
english
he
would
jerk
round
flourish
his
whip
and
cry
dissa
pless
moritz
bad
datta
pless
moritz

soon
he
announced
the
engelish
kirch
thereby
meaning
the
round
arched
english
church
overlooking
the
lake
or
it
might
be
with
a
loftier
sweep
of
the
whip
piz

mit

see
all
this
helen
could
have
told
him
with
equal
accuracy
and
even
greater
detail
had
she
not
almost
learned
by
heart
each
line
of
baedeker
on
the
upper
engadine
could
she
not
have
reproduced
from
memory
a
fairly
complete
map
of
the
valley
with
its
villages
mountains
and
lakes
clearly
marked
but
she
would
not
on
any
account
repress
the
man
enthusiasm
and
her
eager
acceptance
of
his
quaint
information
induced
fresh
efforts
with

she
had
seen
that
he
was
very
lame
as
he
hobbled
about
the
carriage
tying
up
her
boxes
so
here
was
a
real
guide
that
explained
his
romantic
aspect
his
love
of
the
high
places
and
he
had
been
maimed
for
life
by
that
magnificent
mountain
whose
scarred
slopes
were
now
vividly
before
her
eyes
the
bright
sunshine
lit
lakes
and
hills
with
its
glory
a
marvelous
atmosphere
made
all
things
visible
with
microscopic
fidelity
from
campfer
to
silvaplana
looked
to
be
a
ten
minutes
drive
and
from
silvaplana
to
another
quarter
of
an
hour
helen
had
to
consult
her
watch
and
force
herself
to
admit
that
the
horses
were
trotting
fully
seven
miles
an
hour
before
she
realized
that
distances
could
be
so
deceptive
the
summit
of
the
lordly
corvatsch
seemed
to
be
absurdly
near
she
judged
it
within
the
scope
of
an
easy
walk
between
breakfast
and
afternoon
tea
from
the
hotel
on
a
tree
covered
peninsula
that
stretched
far
out
into
lake
and
she
wondered
why
anyone
should
fall
and
break
his
leg
during
such
a
simple
climb
just
to
make
sure
she
glanced
at
the
guidebook
and
it
gave
her
a
shock
when
she
saw
the
words
guides
necessary
descent
to
sils
practicable
only
for
experts
spend
night
at
roseg
inn
the
route
followed
being
that
from
pontresina
then
she
recollected
that
the
lovely
valley
she
was
traversing
from
beginning
to
end
was
itself
six
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
that
the
observatory
on
rugged
old
ben
nevis
which
she
had
visited
when
in
scotland
was
metaphorically
speaking
two
thousand
feet
beneath
the
smooth
road
along
which
she
was
being
driven
and
that
the
highest
peak
on
corvatsch
was
still
six
thousand
feet
above
her
head
all
at
once
helen
felt
subdued
the
fancy
seized
her
that
the
carriage
was
rumbling
over
the
roof
of
the
world
in
a
word
she
was
yielding
to
the
exhilaration
of
high
altitudes
and
her
brain
was
ready
to
spin
wild
fantasies
at
she
was
brought
suddenly
to
earth
again
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
her
driver
was
a
moritz
man
and
therefore
at
constant
feud
with
the
men
from
the
kursaal
who
brought
empty
carriages
to
moritz
and
went
back
laden
with
the
spoil
that
would
otherwise
have
fallen
to
the
share
of
the
local
livery
stables
hence
he
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
pass
every
maloja
owned
vehicle
on
the
road
six
times
he
succeeded
but
on
the
seventh
reversing
the
moral
of
bruce
spider
he
smashed
the
near
hind
wheel
by
attempting
to
slip
between
a
landau
and
a
stone
post
helen
was
almost
thrown
into
the
lake
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
repress
a
scream
but
the
danger
passed
as
rapidly
as
it
had
risen
and
all
that
happened
was
that
the
carriage
settled
down
lamely
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
its
weight
resting
on
one
of
her
boxes
the
driver
spoke
no
more
english
he
bewailed
his
misfortune
in
free
and
fluent
italian
of
the
romansch
order
but
he
understood
german
and
when
helen
demanded
imperatively
that
he
should
unharness
the
horses
and
help
to
prop
the
carriage
off
a
crumpled
tin
trunk
that
contained
her
best
dresses
he
recovered
his
senses
worked
willingly
and
announced
with
a
weary
grin
that
if
the
would
wait
a
little
he
would
obtain
another
wheel
from
a
neighboring
forge
having
recovered
from
her
fright
she
was
so
touched
by
the
poor
fellow
distress
that
she
promised
readily
to
stand
by
him
until
repairs
were
effected
it
was
a
longer
job
than
either
of
them
anticipated
the
axle
was
slightly
bent
and
a
blacksmith
had
to
bring
clamps
and
a
jackscrew
before
the
new
wheel
could
be
adjusted
even
then
it
had
an
air
of
uncertainty
that
rendered
speed
impossible
the
concluding
five
miles
of
the
journey
were
taken
at
a
snail
pace
and
helen
reflected
ruefully
that
it
was
possible
to
bruk
ze
leg
on
the
level
high
road
as
well
as
on
the
rocks
of
corvatsch
of
course
she
received
offers
of
assistance
in
plenty
every
carriage
that
passed
while
the
blacksmith
was
at
work
pulled
up
and
placed
a
seat
therein
at
her
command
but
she
refused
them
all
it
was
not
that
she
feared
to
desert
her
baggage
for
switzerland
is
proverbially
honest
the
unlucky
driver
had
tried
to
be
friendly
his
fault
was
due
to
an
excess
of
zeal
and
each
time
she
declined
the
proffered
help
his
furrowed
face
brightened
if
she
did
not
reach
the
hotel
until
midnight
she
was
determined
to
go
there
in
that
vehicle
and
in
none
other
the
accident
threw
her
late
but
only
by
some
two
hours
instead
of
arriving
at
maloja
in
brilliant
sunshine
it
was
damp
and
chilly
when
she
entered
the
hotel
a
bank
of
mist
had
been
carried
over
the
summit
of
the
pass
by
a
southwesterly
wind
long
before
the
carriage
crawled
round
the
last
great
bend
in
the
road
the
glorious
panorama
of
lake
and
mountains
was
blotted
out
of
sight
the
horses
seemed
to
be
jogging
on
through
a
luminous
cloud
so
dense
that
naught
was
visible
save
a
few
yards
of
roadway
and
the
boundary
wall
or
stone
posts
on
the
left
side
where
lay
the
lake
the
brightness
soon
passed
as
the
hurrying
fog
wraiths
closed
in
on
each
other
it
became
bitterly
cold
too
and
it
was
with
intense
gladness
that
helen
finally
stepped
from
the
outer
gloom
into
a
glass
haven
of
warmth
and
light
that
formed
a
species
of
veranda
in
front
of
the
hotel
she
was
about
to
pay
the
driver
having
added
to
the
agreed
sum
half
the
cost
of
the
broken
wheel
by
way
of
a
solatium
when
another
carriage
drove
up
from
the
direction
of
moritz
she
fancied
that
the
occupant
a
young
man
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
glanced
at
her
as
though
he
knew
her
she
looked
again
to
make
sure
but
by
that
time
his
eyes
were
turned
away
so
he
had
evidently
discovered
his
mistake
still
he
seemed
to
take
considerable
interest
in
her
carriage
and
helen
ever
ready
to
concede
the
most
generous
interpretation
of
doubtful
acts
assumed
that
he
had
heard
of
the
accident
by
some
means
and
was
on
the
lookout
for
her
it
would
indeed
have
been
a
fortunate
thing
for
helen
had
some
swiss
fairy
whispered
the
news
of
her
mishap
in
spencer
ears
during
the
long
drive
up
the
mist
laden
valley
then
at
least
he
might
have
spoken
to
her
and
used
the
informal
introduction
to
make
her
further
acquaintance
on
the
morrow
but
the
knowledge
was
withheld
from
him
no
hint
of
it
was
even
flashed
through
space
by
that
wireless
telegraphy
which
has
existed
between
kin
souls
ever
since
men
and
women
contrived
to
raise
human
affinities
to
a
plane
not
far
removed
from
the
divine
he
had
small
store
of
german
but
he
knew
enough
to
be
perplexed
by
the
way
in
which
helen
driver
expressed
beautiful
thanks
for
her
gift
the
man
seemed
to
be
at
once
grateful
and
downhearted
of
course
the
impression
was
of
the
slightest
but
spencer
had
been
trained
in
reaching
vital
conclusions
on
meager
evidence
he
could
not
wait
to
listen
to
helen
words
so
he
passed
into
the
hotel
having
the
american
habit
of
leaving
the
care
of
his
baggage
to
the
hall
porter
he
wondered
why
helen
was
so
late
in
arriving
that
he
had
caught
her
up
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
kursaal
so
to
speak
he
would
not
forget
the
driver
face
and
if
he
met
the
man
again
it
might
be
possible
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
delay
he
himself
was
before
time
the
federal
railway
authorities
at
coire
awaking
to
the
fact
that
the
holiday
rush
was
beginning
had
actually
dispatched
a
relief
train
to
moritz
when
the
second
important
train
of
the
day
turned
up
as
full
as
its
predecessor
at
dinner
helen
and
he
sat
at
little
tables
in
the
same
section
of
the
huge
dining
hall
the
hotel
was
nearly
full
and
it
was
noticeable
that
they
were
the
only
persons
who
dined
alone
indeed
the
head
waiter
asked
spencer
if
he
cared
to
join
a
party
of
men
who
sat
together
but
he
declined
there
was
no
such
general
gathering
of
women
so
helen
was
given
no
alternative
and
she
ate
the
meal
in
silence
she
saw
vavasour
in
a
remote
part
of
the
salon
with
her
was
a
vacuous
looking
young
man
who
seldom
spoke
to
her
but
was
continually
addressing
remarks
to
a
woman
at
another
table
that
is
the
son
lost
at
lucerne
she
decided
finding
in
his
face
some
of
the
physical
traits
but
none
of
the
calculating
shrewdness
of
his
mother
after
a
repast
of
many
courses
helen
wandered
into
the
great
hall
found
an
empty
chair
and
longed
for
someone
to
speak
to
at
the
first
glance
everybody
seemed
to
know
everybody
else
that
was
not
really
the
case
of
course
there
were
others
present
as
neglected
and
solitary
as
helen
but
the
noise
and
merriment
of
the
greater
number
dominated
the
place
it
resembled
a
social
club
rather
than
a
hotel
her
chair
was
placed
in
an
alley
along
which
people
had
to
pass
who
wished
to
reach
the
glass
covered
veranda
she
amused
herself
by
trying
to
pick
out
the
wraggs
the
and
the
de
la
veres
suddenly
she
was
aware
that
vavasour
and
her
son
were
coming
that
way
the
son
unwillingly
the
mother
with
an
air
of
determination
perhaps
the
lucerne
episode
was
about
to
be
explained
when
young
vavasour
eyes
fell
on
helen
the
boredom
vanished
from
his
face
it
was
quite
obvious
that
he
called
his
mother
attention
to
her
and
asked
who
she
was
helen
felt
that
an
introduction
was
imminent
she
was
glad
of
it
at
that
moment
she
would
have
chatted
gayly
with
even
a
greater
ninny
than
george
de
courcy
vavasour
but
she
had
not
yet
grasped
the
peculiar
idiosyncrasies
of
a
woman
who
was
famous
for
snubbing
those
whom
she
considered
to
be
undesirables
helen
looked
up
with
a
shy
smile
expecting
that
the
older
woman
would
stop
and
speak
but
vavasour
gazed
at
her
blankly
looked
at
the
back
of
her
chair
through
her
body
and
walked
on
i
do
know
george
helen
heard
her
say
there
are
a
lot
of
new
arrivals
some
person
of
no
importance
rather
déclassée
i
should
imagine
by
appearances
as
i
was
telling
you
the
general
has
arranged
taken
altogether
helen
had
crowded
into
portions
of
two
days
many
new
and
some
very
unpleasant
experiences
chapter
v
an
interlude
helen
rose
betimes
next
morning
but
she
found
that
the
sun
had
kept
an
earlier
tryst
not
a
cloud
marred
a
sky
of
dazzling
blue
the
phantom
mist
had
gone
with
the
shadows
from
her
bed
room
window
she
could
see
the
whole
length
of
the
till
the
view
was
abruptly
shut
off
by
the
giant
shoulders
of
lagrev
and
rosatch
the
brilliance
of
the
coloring
was
the
landscape
most
astounding
feature
the
lakes
were
planes
of
polished
turquoise
the
rocks
pure
grays
and
browns
and
reds
the
meadows
emerald
green
while
the
shining
white
patches
of
snow
on
the
highest
mountain
slopes
helped
to
blacken
by
contrast
the
somber
clumps
of
pines
that
gathered
thick
wherever
man
had
not
disputed
with
the
trees
the
tenancy
of
each
foot
of
meager
loam
this
morning
glory
of
nature
gladdened
the
girl
heart
and
drove
from
it
the
overnight
vapors
she
dressed
hurriedly
made
a
light
breakfast
and
went
out
there
was
no
need
to
ask
the
way
in
front
of
the
hotel
the
narrow
silser
see
filled
the
valley
close
behind
lay
the
crest
of
the
pass
a
picturesque
château
was
perched
on
a
sheer
rock
overhanging
the
vale
of
bregaglia
and
commanding
a
far
flung
prospect
almost
to
the
brink
of
como
on
both
sides
rose
the
mountain
barriers
but
toward
the
east
there
was
an
inviting
gorge
beyond
which
the
lofty
cima
di
rosso
flung
its
eternal
snows
heavenward
a
footpath
led
in
that
direction
helen
who
prided
herself
on
her
sense
of
locality
decided
that
it
would
bring
her
to
the
valley
in
which
were
situated
as
she
learned
by
the
map
a
small
lake
and
a
glacier
that
will
be
a
fine
walk
before
lunch
she
said
and
it
is
quite
impossible
to
lose
the
way
so
she
set
off
crossing
the
hotel
golf
course
and
making
for
a
typical
swiss
church
that
crowned
the
nearest
of
the
foothills
passing
the
church
she
found
the
double
doors
in
the
porch
open
and
peeped
in
it
was
a
cozy
little
place
cleaner
and
less
garish
than
such
edifices
are
usually
on
the
continent
the
lamp
burning
before
the
sanctuary
showed
that
it
was
devoted
to
roman
catholic
worship
the
red
gleam
of
the
tiny
sentinel
conveyed
a
curiously
vivid
impression
of
faith
and
spirituality
though
helen
was
a
protestant
she
was
conscious
of
a
benign
emotion
arising
from
the
presence
of
this
simple
token
of
belief
i
must
ascertain
the
hours
of
service
she
thought
it
will
be
delightful
to
join
the
swiss
peasants
in
prayer
one
might
come
near
the
creator
in
this
rustic
tabernacle
she
did
not
cross
the
threshold
of
the
inner
door
at
present
her
mind
was
fixed
on
brisk
movement
in
the
marvelous
air
she
wanted
to
absorb
the
sunshine
to
dispel
once
and
for
all
the
unpleasing
picture
of
life
in
the
high
alps
presented
by
the
stupid
crowd
she
had
met
in
the
hotel
overnight
of
course
she
was
somewhat
unjust
there
but
women
are
predisposed
to
trust
first
impressions
and
helen
was
no
exception
to
her
sex
beyond
the
church
the
path
was
not
so
definite
oddly
enough
it
seemed
to
go
along
the
flat
top
of
a
low
wall
down
to
a
tiny
mountain
stream
steps
were
cut
in
the
opposite
hillside
but
they
were
little
used
and
higher
up
among
some
dwarf
pines
and
azaleas
a
broader
way
wound
back
toward
the
few
scattered
chalets
that
nestled
under
the
château
as
the
guidebook
spoke
of
a
carriage
road
to
lake
cavloccio
and
a
bridle
path
thence
to
within
a
mile
of
the
forno
glacier
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
taking
a
short
cut
at
any
rate
on
the
summit
of
the
next
little
hill
she
would
be
able
to
see
her
way
quite
distinctly
so
she
jumped
across
the
brook
and
climbed
through
the
undergrowth
before
she
had
gone
twenty
yards
she
stopped
she
was
almost
certain
that
someone
was
sobbing
bitterly
up
there
among
the
trees
it
had
an
uncanny
sound
this
plaint
of
grief
in
such
a
quiet
sunlit
spot
still
sorrow
was
not
an
affrighting
thing
to
helen
it
might
stir
her
sympathies
but
it
assuredly
could
not
drive
her
away
in
panic
she
went
on
not
noiselessly
as
she
did
not
wish
to
intrude
on
some
stranger
misery
soon
she
came
to
a
low
wall
and
before
she
quite
realized
her
surroundings
she
was
looking
into
a
grass
grown
cemetery
it
was
a
surprise
this
ambush
of
the
silent
company
among
the
trees
hidden
away
from
the
outer
world
and
so
secluded
that
its
whereabouts
remain
unknown
to
thousands
of
people
who
visit
the
maloja
each
summer
there
was
an
aspect
of
stealth
in
its
sudden
discovery
that
was
almost
menacing
but
helen
was
not
a
nervous
subject
the
sobbing
had
ceased
and
when
the
momentary
effect
of
such
a
depressing
environment
had
been
resolutely
driven
off
she
saw
that
a
rusty
iron
gate
was
open
the
place
was
very
small
there
were
a
few
monuments
so
choked
with
weeds
and
dank
grass
that
their
inscriptions
were
illegible
she
had
never
seen
a
more
desolate
graveyard
despite
the
vivid
light
and
the
joyous
breeze
rustling
the
pine
branches
its
air
of
abandonment
was
depressing
she
fought
against
the
sensation
as
unworthy
of
her
intelligence
but
she
had
some
reason
for
it
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
visible
explanation
of
the
mourning
she
had
undoubtedly
heard
then
she
uttered
an
involuntary
cry
for
a
man
head
and
shoulders
rose
from
behind
a
leafy
shrub
instantly
she
was
ashamed
of
her
fear
it
was
the
old
guide
who
acted
as
coachman
the
previous
evening
and
he
had
been
lying
face
downward
on
the
grass
in
that
part
of
the
cemetery
given
over
to
the
unnamed
dead
he
recognized
her
at
once
struggling
awkwardly
to
his
feet
he
said
in
broken
and
halting
german
i
pray
your
forgiveness
i
fear
i
have
alarmed
you
it
is
i
who
should
ask
forgiveness
she
said
i
came
here
by
accident
i
thought
i
could
go
to
cavloccio
by
this
path
she
could
have
hit
on
no
other
words
so
well
calculated
to
bring
him
back
to
every
day
life
to
direct
the
steps
of
wanderers
in
his
beloved
engadine
was
a
real
pleasure
to
him
for
an
instant
he
forgot
that
they
had
both
spoken
german
no
no
he
cried
animatedly
for
lek
him
go
by
village
bad
road
dissa
way
no
cross
ze
field
then
helen
remembered
that
trespassers
are
sternly
warned
off
the
low
lying
lands
in
the
mountains
grass
is
scarce
and
valuable
until
the
highest
pastures
yield
to
the
arid
rock
pedestrians
must
keep
to
the
beaten
track
i
was
quite
mistaken
she
said
i
see
now
that
the
path
i
was
trying
to
reach
leads
here
only
and
i
am
very
very
sorry
i
disturbed
you
illustration
i
fear
i
have
alarmed
you
he
hobbled
nearer
the
ruin
of
a
fine
man
with
a
nobly
proportioned
head
and
shoulders
but
sadly
maimed
by
the
accident
which
to
all
appearances
made
him
useless
as
a
guide
pardon
an
old
man
folly
he
said
humbly
i
thought
none
could
hear
and
i
felt
the
loss
of
my
little
girl
more
than
ever
your
daughter
is
she
buried
here
yes
many
a
year
has
passed
but
i
miss
her
now
more
than
ever
she
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
i
am
alone
now
and
that
is
a
hard
thing
when
the
back
is
bent
with
age
helen
eyes
grew
moist
but
she
tried
bravely
to
control
her
voice
was
she
young
she
asked
softly
only
twenty
only
twenty
and
as
tall
and
fair
as
yourself
they
carried
her
here
sixteen
years
ago
this
very
day
i
did
not
even
see
her
on
the
previous
night
i
fell
on
corvatsch
oh
how
sad
but
why
did
she
die
at
that
age
and
in
this
splendid
climate
was
her
death
unexpected
unexpected
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
huge
mountain
of
which
the
cemetery
hill
formed
one
of
the
lowermost
buttresses
if
the
piz
della
margna
were
to
topple
over
and
crush
me
where
i
stand
it
would
be
less
unforeseen
than
was
my
sweet
etta
fate
but
i
frighten
you
lady
a
poor
return
for
your
kindness
that
is
your
way
through
the
village
and
by
the
postroad
till
you
reach
a
notice
board
telling
you
where
to
take
the
path
there
was
a
crude
gentility
in
his
manner
that
added
to
the
pathos
of
his
words
helen
was
sure
that
he
wished
to
be
left
alone
with
his
memories
yet
she
lingered
please
tell
me
your
name
she
said
i
may
visit
moritz
while
i
remain
here
and
i
shall
try
to
find
you
christian
stampa
he
said
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
adding
something
but
checked
himself
christian
stampa
he
repeated
after
a
pause
everybody
knows
old
stampa
the
guide
if
i
am
not
there
and
you
go
to
zermatt
some
day
well
just
ask
for
stampa
they
will
tell
you
what
has
become
of
me
she
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
this
broken
careworn
old
man
with
her
cheery
companion
of
the
previous
afternoon
what
did
he
mean
she
understood
his
queer
jargon
of
italianized
german
quite
clearly
but
there
was
a
sinister
ring
in
his
words
that
blanched
her
face
she
could
not
leave
him
in
his
present
mood
she
was
more
alarmed
now
than
when
she
saw
him
rising
ghostlike
from
behind
the
screen
of
grass
and
weeds
please
walk
with
me
to
the
village
she
said
all
this
beautiful
land
is
strange
to
me
it
will
divert
your
thoughts
from
a
mournful
topic
if
you
tell
me
something
of
its
wonders
he
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
church
in
the
neighboring
hollow
and
he
crossed
himself
murmuring
a
few
words
in
italian
she
guessed
their
meaning
he
was
thanking
the
virgin
for
having
sent
to
his
rescue
a
girl
who
reminded
him
of
his
lost
etta
yes
he
said
i
will
come
if
i
were
remaining
in
the
maloja
i
would
beg
you
to
let
me
take
you
to
the
forno
and
perhaps
to
one
of
the
peaks
beyond
old
as
i
am
and
lame
you
would
be
safe
with
me
helen
breathed
freely
again
she
felt
that
she
had
been
within
measurable
distance
of
a
tragedy
nor
was
there
any
call
on
her
wits
to
devise
fresh
means
of
drawing
his
mind
away
from
the
madness
that
possessed
him
a
few
minutes
earlier
as
he
limped
unevenly
by
her
side
his
talk
was
of
the
mountains
did
she
intend
to
climb
well
slow
and
sure
was
the
golden
rule
do
little
or
nothing
during
four
or
five
days
until
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
thin
and
keen
alpine
air
then
go
to
lake
lunghino
that
would
suffice
for
the
first
real
excursion
next
day
she
ought
to
start
early
and
climb
the
mountain
overlooking
that
same
lake
up
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
hotel
all
rock
and
not
difficult
if
the
weather
was
clear
she
would
have
a
grand
view
of
the
bernina
range
next
she
might
try
the
forno
glacier
it
was
a
simple
thing
she
could
go
to
and
from
the
in
ten
hours
afterward
the
cima
di
rosso
offered
an
easy
climb
but
that
meant
sleeping
at
the
hut
all
of
which
was
excellent
advice
though
the
reflection
came
that
stampa
slow
and
sure
methods
were
not
strongly
in
evidence
some
sixteen
hours
earlier
now
the
cima
di
rosso
was
in
full
view
at
that
instant
helen
stopped
do
you
really
mean
to
tell
me
that
if
i
wish
to
reach
the
top
of
that
mountain
i
must
devote
two
days
to
it
she
cried
stampa
though
bothered
with
troubles
beyond
her
ken
forgot
them
sufficiently
to
laugh
grimly
it
is
farther
away
than
you
seem
to
think
but
the
real
difficulty
is
the
ice
unless
you
cross
some
of
the
crevasses
in
the
early
morning
before
the
sun
has
had
time
to
undo
the
work
accomplished
by
the
night
frost
you
run
a
great
risk
and
that
is
why
you
must
be
ready
to
start
from
the
at
dawn
moreover
at
this
time
of
year
you
get
the
finest
view
about
six
the
mention
of
crevasses
was
somewhat
awesome
is
it
necessary
to
be
roped
when
one
tries
that
climb
she
asked
if
any
guide
ever
tells
you
that
you
need
not
be
roped
while
crossing
ice
or
climbing
rock
turn
back
at
once
wait
for
another
day
and
go
with
a
man
who
knows
his
business
that
is
how
the
alps
get
a
bad
name
for
accidents
look
at
me
i
have
climbed
the
matterhorn
forty
times
and
the
jungfrau
times
out
of
count
and
never
did
i
or
anyone
in
my
care
come
to
grief
the
rope
properly
is
my
motto
and
it
has
never
failed
me
not
even
when
two
out
of
five
of
us
were
struck
senseless
by
falling
stones
on
the
south
side
of
monte
rosa
helen
experienced
another
thrill
i
very
much
object
to
falling
stones
she
said
stampa
threw
out
his
hands
in
emphatic
gesture
what
can
one
do
he
cried
they
are
always
a
danger
like
the
snow
cornice
and
the
there
is
a
chimney
on
the
jungfrau
through
which
stones
are
constantly
shooting
from
a
height
of
two
thousand
feet
you
can
not
see
them
they
travel
too
fast
for
the
eye
you
hear
something
sing
past
your
ears
that
is
all
occasionally
there
is
a
report
like
a
gunshot
and
then
you
observe
a
little
cloud
of
dust
rising
from
a
new
scar
on
a
rock
if
you
are
hit
well
there
is
no
dust
because
the
stone
goes
right
through
of
course
one
does
not
loiter
there
then
seeing
the
scared
look
on
her
face
he
went
on
ladies
should
not
go
to
such
places
it
is
not
fit
but
for
men
yes
there
is
the
joy
of
battle
do
not
err
the
mountains
are
alive
and
they
fight
to
the
death
they
can
be
beaten
but
there
must
be
no
mistakes
they
are
like
strong
men
the
hills
when
you
strive
against
them
strain
them
to
your
breast
and
never
relax
your
grip
then
they
yield
slowly
with
many
a
trick
and
false
move
that
a
man
must
learn
if
he
would
look
down
over
them
all
and
say
am
lord
here
ah
me
shall
i
ever
again
cross
the
col
du
lion
or
climb
the
great
tower
but
there
i
am
old
and
thrown
aside
boys
whom
i
engaged
as
porters
would
refuse
me
now
as
their
porter
better
to
have
died
like
my
friend
michel
croz
than
live
to
be
a
goatherd
he
seemed
to
pull
himself
up
with
an
effort
that
way
to
your
left
you
can
not
miss
the
path
and
he
lifted
his
hat
with
the
inborn
grace
of
the
peasantry
of
southern
europe
helen
was
hoping
that
he
might
elect
to
accompany
her
to
cavloccio
she
would
willingly
have
paid
him
for
loss
of
time
her
ear
was
becoming
better
tuned
each
moment
to
his
strange
patois
though
he
often
gave
a
soft
italian
inflection
to
the
harsh
german
syllables
she
grasped
his
meaning
quite
literally
she
had
read
so
much
about
switzerland
that
she
knew
how
michel
croz
was
killed
while
descending
the
matterhorn
after
having
made
the
first
ascent
that
historic
accident
happened
long
before
she
was
born
to
hear
a
man
speak
of
croz
as
a
friend
sounded
almost
unbelievable
though
a
thought
told
her
that
whymper
who
led
the
attack
on
the
hitherto
impregnable
cervin
on
that
july
day
in
was
still
living
a
keen
alpinist
she
could
not
refrain
from
asking
stampa
one
question
though
she
imagined
that
he
was
now
in
a
hurry
to
take
the
damaged
carriage
back
to
moritz
michel
croz
was
a
brave
man
she
said
did
you
know
him
well
i
worshiped
him
was
the
reverent
answer
may
i
receive
pardon
in
my
last
hour
but
i
took
him
for
an
evil
spirit
on
the
day
of
his
death
i
was
with
jean
antoine
carrel
in
signor
party
we
started
from
breuil
croz
and
his
voyageurs
from
zermatt
we
failed
he
succeeded
when
we
saw
him
and
his
englishmen
on
the
summit
we
believed
they
were
devils
because
they
yelled
in
triumph
and
started
an
avalanche
of
stones
to
announce
their
victory
three
days
later
carrel
and
i
with
two
men
from
breuil
tried
again
we
gained
the
top
that
time
and
passed
the
place
where
croz
was
knocked
over
by
the
english
milord
and
the
others
who
fell
with
him
i
saw
three
bodies
on
the
glacier
four
thousand
feet
below
a
fine
better
than
that
up
there
he
looked
back
at
the
pines
which
now
hid
the
cemetery
wall
from
sight
then
with
another
courteous
sweep
of
his
hat
he
walked
away
covering
the
ground
rapidly
despite
his
twisted
leg
if
helen
had
been
better
trained
as
a
woman
journalist
she
would
have
regarded
this
meeting
with
stampa
as
an
incident
of
much
value
long
experience
of
the
lights
and
shades
of
life
might
have
rendered
her
less
sensitive
as
it
was
the
man
personality
appealed
to
her
she
had
been
vouchsafed
a
glimpse
into
an
abyss
profound
as
that
into
which
stampa
himself
peered
on
the
day
he
discovered
three
of
the
four
who
fell
from
the
matterhorn
still
roped
together
in
death
the
old
man
simple
references
to
the
terrors
lurking
in
those
radiant
mountains
had
also
shaken
her
somewhat
the
snow
capped
cima
di
rosso
no
longer
looked
so
attractive
the
orlegna
gorge
had
lost
some
of
its
beauty
though
the
sun
was
pouring
into
its
wooded
depths
it
had
grown
gloomy
and
somber
in
her
eyes
yielding
to
impulse
she
loitered
in
the
village
took
the
carriage
road
to
the
château
and
sat
there
with
her
back
to
the
inner
heights
and
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
smiling
valley
that
opened
toward
italy
out
of
the
septimer
pass
meanwhile
stampa
hurried
past
the
stables
where
his
horses
were
munching
the
remains
of
the
little
oaten
loaves
which
form
the
staple
food
of
hard
worked
animals
in
the
alps
he
entered
the
hotel
by
the
main
entrance
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
manager
bureau
when
spencer
smoking
on
the
veranda
caught
sight
of
him
instantly
the
american
started
in
pursuit
by
this
time
he
had
heard
of
helen
accident
from
one
of
yesterday
passers
by
it
accounted
for
the
delay
but
he
was
anxious
to
learn
exactly
what
had
happened
stampa
reached
the
office
first
he
was
speaking
to
the
manager
when
spencer
came
in
and
said
in
his
downright
way
this
is
the
man
who
drove
miss
wynton
from
moritz
last
night
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
able
to
understand
what
he
says
will
you
kindly
ask
him
what
caused
the
trouble
it
is
quite
an
easy
matter
was
the
smiling
response
poor
stampa
is
not
only
too
eager
to
pass
every
other
vehicle
on
the
road
but
he
is
inclined
to
watch
the
mountains
rather
than
his
horses
ears
he
was
a
famous
guide
once
but
he
met
with
misfortune
and
took
to
carriage
work
as
a
means
of
livelihood
he
has
damaged
his
turnout
twice
this
year
so
this
morning
he
was
dismissed
by
telephone
and
another
driver
is
coming
from
moritz
to
take
his
place
spencer
looked
at
stampa
he
liked
the
strong
worn
face
with
its
half
wistful
half
resigned
expression
an
uneasy
feeling
gripped
him
that
the
whim
of
a
moment
in
the
embankment
hotel
might
exert
its
crazy
influence
in
quarters
far
removed
from
the
track
that
seemed
then
to
be
so
direct
and
why
did
he
want
to
butt
in
between
the
other
fellow
and
the
landscape
what
was
the
hurry
anyhow
he
asked
stampa
smiled
genially
when
the
questions
were
translated
to
him
i
was
talking
to
the
he
explained
using
his
native
tongue
for
he
was
born
on
the
italian
side
of
the
bernina
that
counts
but
it
gives
no
good
reason
why
he
should
risk
her
life
objected
spencer
stampa
weather
furrowed
cheeks
reddened
there
was
no
danger
he
muttered
wrathfully
madonna
i
would
lose
the
use
of
another
limb
rather
than
hurt
a
hair
of
her
head
is
she
not
my
good
angel
has
she
not
drawn
me
back
from
the
gate
of
hell
risk
her
life
are
people
saying
that
because
a
wheel
went
to
pieces
against
a
stone
what
on
earth
is
he
talking
about
demanded
spencer
has
he
been
pestering
miss
wynton
this
morning
with
some
story
of
his
present
difficulties
the
manager
knew
stampa
character
he
put
the
words
in
kindlier
phrase
does
the
know
that
you
have
lost
your
situation
he
said
even
in
that
mild
form
the
suggestion
annoyed
the
old
man
he
flung
it
aside
with
scornful
gesture
and
turned
to
leave
the
office
tell
the
gentleman
to
go
to
zermatt
and
ask
in
the
street
if
christian
stampa
the
guide
would
throw
himself
on
a
woman
charity
he
growled
spencer
did
not
wait
for
any
interpretation
hold
on
he
said
quietly
what
is
he
going
to
do
now
work
for
a
man
of
his
years
does
grow
on
gooseberry
bushes
i
suppose
christian
christian
you
are
as
a
boy
cried
the
manager
the
fact
is
he
went
on
he
came
to
me
to
offer
his
services
but
i
have
already
engaged
more
drivers
than
i
need
and
i
am
dismissing
some
stable
men
perhaps
he
can
find
a
job
in
st
moritz
are
his
days
as
guide
ended
unfortunately
yes
i
believe
he
is
as
active
as
ever
but
people
wo
credit
it
and
you
can
not
blame
them
when
one
safety
depends
on
a
man
who
may
have
to
cling
to
an
ice
covered
rock
like
a
fly
to
a
one
is
apt
to
distrust
a
crooked
leg
did
he
have
an
accident
the
manager
hesitated
it
is
part
of
his
sad
history
he
said
he
fell
and
nearly
killed
himself
but
he
was
hurrying
to
see
the
last
of
a
daughter
to
whom
he
was
devoted
is
he
a
local
man
then
no
oh
no
the
girl
happened
to
be
here
when
the
end
came
well
i
guess
he
will
suit
my
limited
requirements
in
the
fly
and
business
while
i
remain
in
maloja
said
spencer
tell
him
i
am
willing
to
put
up
ten
francs
a
day
and
extras
for
his
exclusive
services
as
guide
during
my
stay
poor
stampa
was
nearly
overwhelmed
by
this
unexpected
good
fortune
in
his
agitation
he
blurted
out
ah
then
the
good
god
did
really
send
an
angel
to
my
help
this
morning
spencer
however
reviewing
his
own
benevolence
over
a
pipe
outside
the
hotel
expressed
the
cynical
opinion
that
the
hot
sun
was
affecting
his
brain
i
on
a
loose
end
he
communed
next
time
i
waft
myself
to
europe
on
a
steamer
i
bring
my
mother
it
would
be
a
bully
fine
notion
to
cable
for
her
right
away
i
want
someone
to
take
care
of
me
it
looks
as
if
i
had
a
cinch
on
running
this
hotel
gratis
what
in
thunder
will
happen
next
he
could
surely
have
answered
that
query
if
he
had
the
least
inkling
of
the
circumstances
governing
helen
prior
meeting
with
stampa
as
it
was
the
development
of
events
followed
the
natural
course
while
spencer
strolled
off
by
the
side
of
the
lake
the
old
guide
lumbered
into
the
village
street
and
waited
there
knowing
that
he
would
waylay
the
on
her
return
though
she
came
from
the
château
and
not
from
cavloccio
he
did
not
fail
to
see
her
at
first
she
was
at
a
loss
to
fathom
the
cause
of
stampa
delight
and
still
less
to
understand
why
he
should
want
to
thank
her
with
such
exuberance
she
imagined
he
was
overjoyed
at
having
gone
back
to
his
beloved
profession
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
questioning
that
she
discovered
the
truth
then
it
dawned
on
her
that
the
man
had
been
goaded
to
desperation
by
the
curt
message
from
moritz
that
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
abandon
the
struggle
and
follow
into
the
darkness
the
daughter
taken
from
him
so
many
years
ago
and
the
remembrance
of
her
suspicion
when
they
were
about
to
part
at
the
cemetery
gate
lent
a
serious
note
to
her
words
of
congratulation
you
see
stampa
she
said
you
were
very
wrong
to
lose
faith
this
morning
at
the
very
moment
of
your
deepest
despair
heaven
was
providing
a
good
friend
for
you
yes
indeed
that
is
why
i
waited
here
i
felt
that
i
must
thank
you
it
was
all
through
you
the
good
god
sent
you
i
think
you
are
far
more
beholden
to
the
gentleman
who
employed
you
than
to
me
she
broke
in
yes
he
is
splendid
the
young
but
it
was
wholly
on
your
account
lady
he
was
angry
with
me
at
first
because
he
thought
i
placed
you
in
peril
in
the
matter
of
the
wheel
helen
was
amazed
he
spoke
of
me
she
cried
ah
yes
he
did
not
say
much
but
his
eyes
looked
through
me
he
has
the
eyes
of
a
true
man
that
young
american
she
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
what
is
his
name
she
asked
here
it
is
the
director
wrote
it
for
me
so
that
i
may
learn
how
to
pronounce
it
stampa
produced
a
scrap
of
paper
and
helen
read
charles
k
spencer
are
you
quite
certain
he
mentioned
me
she
repeated
can
i
be
mistaken
i
know
because
i
studied
the
labels
on
your
boxes
mees
hélène
weenton
so
and
did
he
not
rate
me
about
the
accident
well
wonders
will
never
cease
she
vowed
and
indeed
they
were
only
just
beginning
in
her
life
which
shows
how
blind
to
excellent
material
wonders
can
be
at
luncheon
she
summoned
the
head
waiter
is
there
a
charles
spencer
staying
in
the
hotel
she
asked
yes
madam
will
you
please
tell
me
if
he
is
in
the
room
the
head
waiter
turned
spencer
was
studying
the
menu
yes
madam
there
he
is
sitting
alone
at
the
second
table
from
the
window
it
was
quite
to
be
expected
that
the
subject
of
their
joint
gaze
should
look
at
them
instantly
there
is
a
magnetism
in
the
human
eye
that
is
unfailing
in
that
respect
and
its
power
is
increased
a
hundredfold
when
a
charming
young
woman
tries
it
on
a
young
man
who
happens
to
be
thinking
of
her
at
the
moment
then
spencer
realized
that
stampa
had
told
helen
what
had
taken
place
in
the
hotel
bureau
and
he
wanted
to
kick
himself
for
having
forgotten
to
make
secrecy
a
part
of
the
bargain
helen
knowing
that
he
knew
blushed
furiously
she
tried
to
hide
her
confusion
by
murmuring
something
to
the
head
waiter
but
in
her
heart
she
was
saying
who
in
the
world
is
he
i
have
never
seen
him
before
last
night
and
why
am
i
such
an
idiot
as
to
tremble
all
over
just
because
he
happened
to
catch
me
looking
at
him
chapter
vi
the
battlefield
both
man
and
woman
were
far
too
well
bred
to
indulge
in
an
the
knowledge
that
each
was
thinking
of
the
other
led
rather
to
an
ostentatious
avoidance
of
anything
that
could
be
construed
into
any
such
flirtatious
overture
though
stampa
curious
statement
had
puzzled
helen
she
soon
hit
on
the
theory
that
the
american
must
have
heard
of
the
accident
to
her
carriage
yes
that
supplied
a
ready
explanation
no
doubt
he
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
her
on
the
road
he
arrived
at
the
hotel
almost
simultaneously
with
herself
and
she
had
not
forgotten
his
somewhat
inquiring
glance
as
they
stood
together
on
the
steps
with
the
chivalry
of
his
race
in
all
things
concerning
womankind
he
was
eager
to
render
assistance
and
under
the
circumstances
he
probably
wondered
what
sort
of
damsel
in
distress
it
was
that
needed
help
it
was
natural
enough
too
that
in
engaging
stampa
he
should
refer
to
the
carelessness
that
brought
about
the
collapse
of
the
wheel
really
when
one
came
to
analyze
an
incident
seemingly
inexplicable
it
resolved
itself
into
quite
commonplace
constituents
she
found
it
awkward
that
he
should
be
sitting
between
her
and
a
window
commanding
the
best
view
of
the
lake
if
spencer
had
been
at
any
other
table
she
could
have
feasted
her
eyes
on
the
whole
expanse
of
the
valley
therefore
she
had
every
excuse
for
looking
that
way
whereas
he
had
none
for
gazing
at
her
spencer
appeared
to
be
aware
of
this
disability
for
lack
of
better
occupation
he
scrutinized
the
writing
on
the
menu
with
a
prolonged
intentness
worthy
of
a
gourmand
or
an
expert
graphologist
helen
rose
first
and
that
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
note
her
graceful
carriage
though
born
in
the
states
he
was
of
british
stock
and
he
did
not
share
the
professed
opinion
of
the
american
humorist
that
the
typical
englishwoman
is
angular
has
large
feet
and
does
not
know
how
to
walk
helen
at
any
rate
betrayed
none
of
these
elements
of
caricature
though
there
were
several
smart
women
in
the
hotel
women
who
clung
desperately
to
the
fringe
of
society
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
his
protégée
was
easily
first
among
the
few
who
had
any
claim
to
good
looks
helen
was
not
only
tall
and
lithe
but
her
movements
were
marked
by
a
quiet
elegance
it
was
her
custom
in
nearly
all
weathers
to
walk
from
bayswater
to
professor
von
eulenberg
study
which
needless
to
say
was
situated
near
the
british
museum
she
usually
returned
by
a
longer
route
unless
pelting
rain
or
the
misery
of
london
snow
made
the
streets
intolerable
thus
there
was
hardly
a
day
that
she
did
not
cover
eight
miles
at
a
rapid
pace
a
method
of
training
that
eclipsed
all
the
artifices
of
beauty
doctors
and
schools
of
deportment
her
sweetly
pretty
face
her
abundance
of
shining
brown
hair
her
slim
well
proportioned
figure
and
the
almost
athletic
swing
of
her
well
arched
shoulders
would
entitle
her
to
notice
in
a
gathering
of
beauties
far
more
noted
than
those
who
graced
maloja
with
their
presence
that
year
in
addition
to
these
physical
attractions
she
carried
with
her
the
rarer
and
indefinable
aura
of
the
born
aristocrat
as
it
happened
she
merited
that
description
both
by
birth
and
breeding
but
there
is
a
vast
company
entitled
to
consideration
on
that
score
to
whom
nature
has
cruelly
denied
the
necessary
hallmarks
otherwise
the
pages
of
burke
would
surely
be
embellished
with
portraits
indeed
so
far
as
appearance
went
it
was
rather
ludicrous
to
regard
helen
as
the
social
inferior
of
any
person
then
resident
in
the
kursaal
and
it
is
probable
that
a
glimmering
knowledge
of
this
fact
inflamed
de
courcy
vavasour
wrath
to
boiling
point
when
a
few
minutes
later
she
saw
her
son
coolly
walk
up
to
the
undesirable
and
enter
into
conversation
with
her
helen
was
seated
in
a
shady
corner
a
flood
of
sunlight
filled
the
glass
covered
veranda
with
a
grateful
warmth
she
had
picked
up
an
astonishingly
well
written
and
scholarly
guide
book
issued
by
the
proprietors
of
the
hotel
and
was
deep
in
its
opening
treatise
on
the
history
and
racial
characteristics
of
the
engadiners
when
she
was
surprised
at
hearing
herself
addressed
by
name
er
miss
er
wynton
i
believe
said
a
drawling
voice
looking
up
she
found
george
de
courcy
vavasour
bending
over
her
in
an
attitude
that
betokened
the
utmost
admiration
for
both
parties
to
the
under
ordinary
conditions
that
is
to
say
if
existence
depended
on
his
own
exertions
helen
eyes
would
have
dwelt
on
a
gawky
youth
endowed
with
a
certain
pertness
that
might
in
time
have
brought
him
from
behind
the
counter
of
a
drapery
store
to
the
wider
arena
of
the
floor
as
it
was
a
reasonably
large
income
gave
him
unbounded
assurance
and
his
credit
with
a
good
tailor
was
unquestionable
he
represented
a
british
product
that
flourishes
best
in
alien
soil
there
exists
a
foreign
legion
of
george
de
courcy
vavasours
flaccid
heroes
of
fashion
plates
whose
parade
grounds
change
with
the
seasons
from
paris
to
the
riviera
and
from
the
riviera
to
some
nook
in
the
alps
providence
and
a
grandfather
have
conspired
in
their
behalf
to
make
work
unnecessary
but
providence
more
than
grandfathers
has
decreed
that
they
shall
be
effete
and
light
brained
so
the
type
does
not
endure
helen
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
became
aware
that
de
courcy
vavasour
was
advancing
with
all
the
plumes
of
the
british
matron
ruffled
for
battle
it
was
not
in
human
nature
that
the
girl
should
not
recall
the
slight
offered
her
the
previous
evening
with
the
thought
came
the
temptation
to
repay
it
now
with
interest
but
she
thrust
it
aside
yes
that
is
my
name
she
said
smiling
pleasantly
well
er
the
general
has
asked
me
to
er
invite
you
take
part
in
some
of
our
tournaments
we
have
tennis
you
know
an
golf
croquet
an
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
you
play
tennis
an
i
rather
fancy
you
a
golfer
as
well
you
look
that
kind
of
girl
eh
what
he
caressed
a
small
mustache
as
he
spoke
using
the
finger
and
thumb
of
each
hand
alternately
and
helen
noticed
that
his
hands
were
surprisingly
large
when
compared
with
his
otherwise
fragile
frame
who
is
the
general
she
inquired
oh
wragg
you
know
he
looks
after
everything
in
the
amusement
line
an
i
help
do
let
me
put
you
down
for
the
singles
an
mixed
doubles
none
of
the
women
here
can
play
for
nuts
an
i
have
got
a
partner
yet
for
the
doubles
i
been
waitin
for
someone
like
you
to
turn
up
you
have
not
remained
long
in
suspense
she
could
not
help
saying
you
are
vavasour
are
you
not
yes
better
known
as
georgie
and
you
arrived
in
maloja
last
evening
i
think
well
i
do
play
tennis
or
rather
i
used
to
play
fairly
well
some
years
ago
by
gad
just
what
i
thought
go
slow
in
your
practice
games
miss
wynton
an
you
have
a
rippin
handicap
would
that
be
quite
honest
said
helen
lifting
her
steadfast
brown
eyes
to
meet
his
somewhat
too
free
scrutiny
honest
rather
you
wait
till
you
see
the
old
guard
pullin
out
a
bit
when
they
settle
down
to
real
business
but
the
general
is
up
to
their
little
dodges
he
knows
their
form
like
a
book
an
he
gets
every
one
of
shaken
out
by
the
first
round
eh
what
the
arrangement
seems
to
be
ideal
if
one
is
friendly
with
the
general
said
helen
vavasour
drew
up
a
chair
he
also
drew
up
the
ends
of
his
trousers
thus
revealing
that
the
pomeranian
brown
and
myrtle
green
stripes
in
his
necktie
were
faithfully
reproduced
in
his
socks
while
these
master
tints
were
thoughtfully
developed
in
the
subdominant
hues
of
his
clothes
and
boots
by
jove
what
a
stroke
of
luck
i
should
have
got
hold
of
you
first
he
chuckled
i
pretty
good
at
the
net
miss
wynton
if
we
manage
things
properly
we
ought
to
have
the
mixed
doubles
a
gift
with
plus
half
forty
an
in
the
ladies
singles
you
be
a
queen
club
champion
at
nine
eh
what
though
vavasour
represented
a
species
of
inane
young
man
whom
helen
detested
she
bore
with
him
because
she
hungered
for
the
sound
of
an
english
voice
in
friendly
converse
this
bright
morning
at
times
her
life
was
lonely
enough
in
london
but
she
had
never
felt
her
isolation
there
the
great
city
appealed
to
her
in
all
its
moods
her
cheerful
yet
sensitive
nature
did
not
shrink
from
contact
with
its
hurrying
crowds
the
mere
sense
of
aloofness
among
so
many
millions
of
people
brought
with
it
the
knowledge
that
she
was
one
of
them
a
human
atom
plunged
into
a
heedless
vortex
the
moment
she
passed
from
her
house
into
the
street
here
in
maloja
things
were
different
while
her
own
identity
was
laid
bare
while
men
and
women
canvassed
her
name
her
appearance
her
occupation
she
was
cut
off
from
them
by
a
social
wall
of
their
own
contriving
the
attitude
of
the
younger
women
told
her
that
trespassers
were
forbidden
within
that
sacred
fold
she
knew
now
that
she
had
done
a
daring
thing
outraged
one
of
the
cheap
conventions
in
coming
alone
to
this
swiss
valley
better
a
thousand
times
have
sought
lodgings
in
some
small
village
inn
and
mixed
with
the
homely
folk
who
journeyed
thither
on
the
diligence
or
tramped
joyously
afoot
than
strive
to
win
the
sympathy
of
any
of
these
shallow
nonentities
of
the
smart
set
even
while
listening
to
georgie
efforts
to
win
her
smiles
with
slangy
confidences
she
saw
that
vavasour
had
halted
in
mid
career
and
joined
a
group
of
women
evidently
a
mother
and
two
daughters
and
that
she
herself
was
the
subject
of
their
talk
she
wondered
why
she
was
somewhat
perplexed
when
the
conclave
broke
up
suddenly
the
girls
going
to
the
door
vavasour
retreating
majestically
to
the
far
end
of
the
veranda
and
the
other
elderly
woman
drawing
a
short
fat
red
faced
man
away
from
a
discussion
with
another
man
jolly
place
this
vavasour
was
saying
there
dancin
most
nights
the
dowager
brigade
want
the
band
to
play
classical
music
that
sort
of
rot
you
know
but
de
la
vere
and
the
wragg
girls
like
a
hop
an
we
generally
arrange
things
our
own
way
we
have
a
dance
if
you
wish
it
but
you
must
promise
to
georgie
cried
the
pompous
little
man
i
want
you
a
minute
vavasour
swung
round
evidently
he
regarded
the
interruption
as
a
beastly
bore
all
right
general
he
said
airily
i
be
there
soon
no
hurry
is
there
yes
i
want
you
now
the
order
was
emphatic
the
general
only
military
asset
was
a
martinet
voice
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
rather
rotten
is
it
interferin
with
a
fellow
in
this
way
muttered
vavasour
will
you
excuse
me
i
must
see
what
the
old
boy
is
worryin
about
i
shall
come
back
soon
eh
what
i
am
going
out
said
helen
but
we
shall
meet
again
i
remain
here
a
month
you
enter
for
the
tournament
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
i
think
so
it
will
be
something
to
do
thanks
awfully
and
do
forget
helen
laughed
she
could
not
help
it
the
younger
members
of
the
wragg
family
were
eying
her
sourly
through
the
glass
partition
they
seemed
to
be
nice
girls
too
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
disillusion
them
speedily
if
they
thought
that
she
harbored
designs
on
the
callow
youth
whom
they
probably
regarded
as
their
own
special
cavalier
when
she
passed
through
the
inner
doorway
to
go
to
her
room
she
noticed
that
the
general
was
giving
georgie
some
instructions
which
were
listened
to
in
sulky
silence
indeed
that
remarkable
was
laying
down
the
law
of
the
british
parish
with
a
clearness
that
was
admirable
he
had
been
young
himself
once
dammit
and
had
as
keen
an
eye
for
a
pretty
face
as
any
other
fellow
but
no
gentleman
could
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
an
unattached
female
under
the
very
nose
of
his
mother
not
to
mention
the
noses
of
other
ladies
who
were
his
friends
georgie
broke
out
in
protest
oh
but
i
say
general
she
is
a
lady
an
you
yourself
said
i
know
i
did
i
was
wrong
even
a
wary
old
bird
like
me
can
make
a
mistake
vavasour
has
just
warned
my
wife
about
her
it
no
good
arguing
georgie
my
boy
nowadays
you
ca
draw
the
line
too
rigidly
things
permissible
in
paris
or
nice
wo
pass
muster
here
i
sorry
georgie
she
a
high
stepper
and
devilish
taking
i
admit
writes
for
some
rag
er
for
some
cheap
society
paper
i
hear
why
dash
it
all
she
will
be
lampooning
us
in
it
before
we
know
where
we
are
just
you
go
and
tell
your
mother
you
behave
better
in
future
excellent
woman
vavasour
she
never
makes
a
mistake
gad
do
you
remember
how
she
spotted
that
waiter
from
the
ritz
who
gulled
the
lot
of
us
at
the
jetée
last
winter
took
him
for
the
french
marquis
he
said
he
was
every
one
of
us
women
and
all
till
fixed
her
eye
on
him
and
said
damme
how
he
curled
up
george
was
still
obdurate
a
masquerading
waiter
differed
from
helen
in
many
essentials
he
was
a
frenchman
an
they
mostly
rotters
this
girl
is
english
general
an
i
shall
look
a
proper
sort
of
an
ass
if
i
freeze
up
suddenly
after
what
i
said
to
her
not
for
the
first
time
my
boy
and
mebbe
not
for
the
last
then
in
view
of
the
younger
man
obvious
defiance
the
general
white
mustache
bristled
of
course
you
can
please
yourself
he
growled
but
neither
wragg
nor
my
daughters
will
tolerate
your
acquaintance
with
that
person
oh
all
right
general
came
the
irritated
answer
between
you
the
mater
i
got
to
come
to
heel
but
it
a
beastly
shame
i
say
an
you
all
makin
a
jolly
big
mistake
georgie
intelligence
might
be
superficial
but
he
knew
a
lady
when
he
met
one
and
helen
had
attracted
him
powerfully
he
was
thanking
his
stars
for
the
good
fortune
that
numbered
him
among
the
earliest
of
her
acquaintances
in
the
hotel
and
it
was
too
bad
that
the
barring
edict
should
have
been
issued
against
her
so
unexpectedly
but
he
was
not
of
a
fighting
breed
and
he
quailed
before
the
threat
of
wragg
displeasure
helen
after
a
delightful
ramble
past
the
château
and
along
the
picturesque
turns
and
twists
of
the
colline
des
artistes
returned
in
time
for
tea
which
was
served
on
the
veranda
the
common
rendezvous
of
the
hotel
during
daylight
no
one
spoke
to
her
she
went
out
again
and
walked
by
the
lake
till
the
shadows
fell
and
the
mountains
glittered
in
purple
and
gold
she
dressed
herself
in
a
simple
white
evening
frock
dined
in
solitary
state
and
ventured
into
the
ball
room
after
dinner
georgie
was
dancing
with
de
la
vere
a
languid
looking
woman
who
seemed
to
be
pining
for
admiration
at
the
conclusion
of
the
waltz
that
was
going
on
when
helen
entered
vavasour
brought
his
partner
a
whisky
and
soda
and
a
cigarette
he
passed
helen
twice
but
ignored
her
and
whirled
one
of
the
wragg
girls
off
into
a
polka
again
he
failed
to
see
her
when
parties
were
being
formed
for
a
quadrille
even
to
herself
she
did
not
attempt
to
deny
a
feeling
of
annoyance
though
she
extracted
a
bitter
amusement
from
the
knowledge
that
she
had
been
slighted
by
such
a
vapid
creature
she
was
under
no
misconception
as
to
what
had
happened
the
women
were
making
a
dead
set
against
her
if
she
had
been
plain
or
dowdy
they
might
have
been
friendly
enough
it
was
an
unpardonable
offense
that
she
should
be
good
looking
unchaperoned
and
not
one
of
the
queerly
assorted
mixture
they
deemed
their
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
really
angry
she
realized
that
her
only
crime
was
poverty
given
a
little
share
of
the
wealth
held
by
many
of
these
passée
matrons
and
girls
she
would
be
a
reigning
star
among
them
and
could
act
and
talk
as
she
liked
yet
her
shyness
and
reserve
would
have
been
her
best
credentials
to
any
society
that
was
constituted
on
a
sounder
basis
than
a
gathering
of
snobs
among
really
people
she
would
certainly
have
been
received
on
an
equal
footing
until
some
valid
reason
for
ostracism
was
forthcoming
the
imported
limpets
on
this
swiss
rock
of
gentility
were
not
sure
of
their
own
grip
hence
they
strenuously
refused
to
make
room
for
a
newcomer
until
they
were
shoved
aside
poor
disillusioned
helen
when
she
went
to
church
she
prayed
to
the
good
lord
to
deliver
her
and
everybody
else
from
envy
hatred
and
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
she
felt
now
that
there
might
well
be
added
to
the
litany
a
fresh
petition
which
should
include
british
communities
on
the
continent
in
the
list
of
avoidable
evils
at
that
instant
the
piquant
face
and
figure
of
millicent
jaques
rose
before
her
mind
eye
she
pictured
to
herself
the
cool
effrontery
with
which
the
actress
would
crush
these
waspish
women
by
creating
a
court
of
every
eligible
man
in
the
place
it
was
not
a
healthy
thought
but
it
was
the
offspring
of
sheer
vexation
and
helen
experienced
her
second
temptation
that
day
when
de
la
vere
the
irresistible
reginald
of
vavasour
sketchy
reminiscences
came
and
asked
her
to
dance
she
recognized
him
at
once
he
sat
with
de
la
vere
at
table
and
never
spoke
to
her
unless
it
was
strictly
necessary
he
had
distinguished
manners
a
pleasant
voice
and
a
charming
smile
and
he
seemed
to
be
the
devoted
slave
of
every
pretty
woman
in
the
hotel
except
his
wife
please
pardon
the
informality
he
said
with
an
affability
that
cloaked
the
impertinence
we
are
quite
a
family
party
at
maloja
i
hear
you
are
staying
here
some
weeks
and
we
are
bound
to
get
to
know
each
other
sooner
or
later
helen
could
dance
well
she
was
so
mortified
by
the
injustice
meted
out
to
her
that
she
almost
accepted
de
la
vere
partnership
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
her
soul
rebelled
against
the
man
covert
insolence
and
she
said
quietly
no
thank
you
i
do
not
care
to
dance
may
i
sit
here
and
talk
he
persisted
i
am
just
going
she
said
and
i
think
de
la
vere
is
looking
for
you
by
happy
chance
the
woman
in
question
was
standing
alone
in
the
center
of
the
ball
room
obviously
in
quest
of
some
man
who
would
take
her
to
the
foyer
for
a
cigarette
helen
retreated
with
the
honors
of
war
but
the
irresistible
one
only
laughed
that
idiot
georgie
told
the
truth
then
he
admitted
and
she
knows
what
the
other
women
are
saying
what
cats
these
dear
creatures
can
be
to
be
sure
spencer
happened
to
be
an
interested
onlooker
indeed
he
was
trying
to
arrive
at
the
best
means
of
obtaining
an
introduction
to
helen
when
he
saw
de
la
vere
stroll
leisurely
up
to
her
with
the
assured
air
of
one
sated
by
conquest
the
girl
brushed
close
to
him
as
he
stood
in
the
passage
she
held
her
head
high
and
her
eyes
were
sparkling
he
had
not
heard
what
was
said
but
de
la
vere
discomfiture
was
so
patent
that
even
his
wife
smiled
as
she
sailed
out
on
the
arm
of
a
youthful
purveyor
of
cigarettes
spencer
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
kick
de
la
vere
yet
in
some
sense
he
shared
that
redoubtable
rebuff
he
too
was
wondering
if
the
social
life
of
a
swiss
hotel
would
permit
him
to
seek
a
dance
with
helen
under
existing
conditions
it
would
provide
quite
a
humorous
episode
he
told
himself
to
strike
up
a
friendship
with
her
he
could
not
imagine
why
she
had
adopted
such
an
aloof
attitude
toward
all
and
sundry
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
declined
anything
in
the
guise
of
promiscuous
acquaintance
and
he
like
her
felt
lonely
there
were
several
americans
in
the
hotel
and
he
would
probably
meet
some
of
the
men
in
the
bar
or
smoking
room
after
the
dance
was
ended
but
he
would
have
preferred
a
pleasant
chat
with
helen
that
evening
and
now
she
had
gone
to
her
room
in
a
huff
then
an
inspiration
came
to
him
guess
i
stir
up
mackenzie
to
send
along
an
introduction
he
said
a
telegram
will
fix
things
it
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
explain
matters
in
the
curt
language
of
the
wire
he
found
and
it
savored
of
absurdity
to
amaze
the
scot
with
a
long
message
so
he
compromised
between
desire
and
expediency
by
a
letter
dear
mackenzie
he
wrote
life
is
not
rapid
at
this
terminus
it
might
take
on
some
new
features
if
i
had
the
privilege
of
saying
de
do
to
miss
wynton
will
you
oblige
me
by
telling
her
that
one
of
your
best
and
newest
friends
happens
to
be
in
the
same
hotel
as
her
charming
self
and
that
if
she
gets
him
to
sparkle
he
which
is
i
will
help
considerable
with
copy
for
firefly
advise
me
by
same
post
and
the
rest
of
the
situation
is
up
to
yours
faithfully
the
letter
was
posted
and
spencer
waited
five
tiresome
days
he
saw
little
or
nothing
of
helen
save
at
meals
once
he
met
her
on
a
footpath
that
runs
through
a
wood
by
the
side
of
the
lake
to
the
little
hamlet
of
isola
and
he
was
minded
to
raise
his
hat
as
he
would
have
done
to
any
other
woman
in
the
hotel
whom
he
encountered
under
similar
circumstances
but
she
deliberately
looked
away
and
his
intended
courtesy
must
have
passed
unheeded
as
he
sedulously
avoided
any
semblance
of
dogging
her
footsteps
he
could
not
know
how
she
was
being
persecuted
by
de
la
vere
vavasour
and
one
or
two
other
men
of
like
habit
that
knowledge
was
yet
to
come
consequently
he
deemed
her
altogether
too
prudish
and
was
so
out
of
patience
with
her
that
he
and
stampa
went
off
for
a
two
climb
by
way
of
the
muretto
pass
to
chiareggio
and
back
to
over
the
fex
glacier
footsore
and
tired
but
thoroughly
converted
to
the
marvels
of
the
high
alps
he
reached
the
kursaal
side
by
side
with
the
postman
who
brought
the
chief
english
mail
about
six
each
evening
he
waited
with
an
eager
crowd
of
residents
while
the
hall
porter
sorted
the
letters
there
were
some
for
him
from
america
and
one
from
london
in
a
handwriting
that
was
strange
to
him
but
he
had
quick
eyes
and
he
saw
that
a
letter
addressed
to
miss
helen
wynton
in
the
flamboyant
envelope
of
the
firefly
bore
the
same
script
mackenzie
had
risen
to
the
occasion
he
even
indulged
in
a
classical
joke
there
is
something
in
the
name
of
helen
that
attracts
he
said
were
it
not
for
the
lady
whose
face
drew
a
thousand
ships
to
ilium
we
should
never
have
heard
of
paris
or
troy
or
the
heel
of
achilles
and
all
these
would
be
greatly
missed
and
i
should
never
have
heard
of
mackenzie
or
maloja
thought
spencer
sinking
into
a
chair
and
looking
about
to
learn
whether
or
not
the
girl
would
find
her
letter
before
he
went
to
dress
for
dinner
he
was
sure
she
knew
his
name
perhaps
when
she
read
the
note
she
too
would
search
the
spacious
lounge
with
those
fine
eyes
of
hers
for
the
man
described
therein
if
that
were
so
he
meant
to
go
to
her
instantly
discuss
the
strangeness
of
the
coincidence
that
led
to
two
of
mackenzie
friends
being
at
the
hotel
at
the
same
time
and
suggest
that
they
should
dine
together
the
project
seemed
feasible
and
it
was
decidedly
pleasant
in
perspective
he
longed
to
compare
notes
with
her
to
tell
her
the
quaint
stories
of
the
hills
related
to
him
by
stampa
in
a
medley
of
english
french
italian
and
german
perhaps
to
plan
delightful
trips
to
the
fairyland
in
company
people
began
to
clear
away
from
the
hall
porter
table
yet
helen
remained
invisible
he
could
hardly
have
missed
her
but
to
make
certain
he
rose
and
glanced
at
the
few
remaining
letters
yes
the
firefly
gaudy
imprint
still
gleamed
at
him
he
turned
way
disappointed
after
his
long
tramp
and
a
night
in
a
weird
italian
inn
a
bath
was
imperative
and
the
boom
of
the
dressing
gong
was
imminent
he
was
crossing
the
hall
toward
the
elevator
when
he
heard
her
voice
i
am
so
glad
you
are
keen
on
an
early
climb
she
was
saying
with
a
new
note
of
confidence
that
stirred
him
strangely
i
have
been
longing
to
leave
the
sign
boards
and
footpaths
far
behind
but
i
felt
rather
afraid
of
going
to
the
forno
for
the
first
time
with
a
guide
you
see
i
know
nothing
about
mountaineering
and
you
can
put
me
up
to
all
the
dodges
beforehand
show
you
the
ropes
in
fact
agreed
the
man
with
her
mark
bower
spencer
was
so
completely
taken
by
surprise
that
he
could
only
stare
at
the
two
as
though
they
were
ghosts
they
had
entered
the
hotel
together
and
had
apparently
been
out
for
a
walk
helen
picked
up
her
letter
and
held
it
carelessly
in
her
hand
while
she
continued
to
talk
with
bower
her
pleasurable
excitement
was
undeniable
she
regarded
her
companion
as
a
friend
and
was
evidently
overjoyed
at
his
presence
spencer
banged
into
the
elevator
astonished
the
attendant
and
two
other
occupants
by
the
savagery
of
his
command
au
deuxième
vite
and
paced
through
a
long
corridor
with
noisy
clatter
of
boots
he
was
in
a
rare
fret
and
fume
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
alone
bower
was
at
helen
table
it
was
brightened
by
rare
flowers
not
often
seen
in
sterile
maloja
a
bottle
of
champagne
rested
in
an
ice
bucket
by
his
side
he
had
brought
with
him
the
atmosphere
of
london
of
the
pleasant
life
that
london
offers
to
those
who
can
buy
her
favors
truly
this
helen
all
unconsciously
had
not
only
found
the
heel
of
a
modern
achilles
but
was
wounding
him
sorely
for
now
spencer
knew
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
frank
eyes
smiling
into
his
as
they
were
smiling
into
bower
and
no
matter
what
turn
events
took
a
sinister
element
had
been
thrust
into
a
harmless
idyl
by
this
man
arrival
chapter
vii
some
skirmishing
later
the
american
saw
the
two
sitting
in
the
hall
they
were
chatting
with
the
freedom
of
old
friends
helen
animated
face
showed
that
the
subject
of
their
talk
was
deeply
interesting
she
was
telling
bower
of
the
slights
inflicted
on
her
by
the
other
women
but
spencer
interpreted
her
intent
manner
as
supplying
sufficient
proof
of
a
stronger
emotion
than
mere
friendliness
he
was
beginning
to
detest
bower
it
was
his
habit
to
decide
quickly
when
two
ways
opened
before
him
he
soon
settled
his
course
now
to
remain
in
the
hotel
under
present
conditions
involved
a
loss
of
self
respect
he
thought
he
went
to
the
bureau
asked
for
his
account
and
ordered
a
carriage
to
moritz
for
the
morrow
fast
train
to
england
the
manager
was
politely
regretful
you
are
leaving
us
at
the
wrong
time
sir
he
said
within
the
next
few
days
we
ought
to
have
a
midsummer
storm
when
even
the
lower
hills
will
be
covered
with
snow
then
we
usually
enjoy
a
long
spell
of
magnificent
weather
sorry
said
spencer
i
like
the
scramble
up
there
and
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
bernina
range
and
old
stampa
is
a
gem
of
a
guide
but
i
can
hardly
put
off
any
longer
some
business
that
needs
attention
in
england
anyhow
i
shall
come
back
perhaps
next
month
stampa
says
it
is
all
right
here
in
september
our
best
month
i
assure
you
and
the
ideal
time
to
drop
down
into
italy
when
you
are
tired
of
the
mountains
i
must
let
it
go
at
that
i
intend
to
fix
stampa
so
that
he
can
remain
here
till
the
end
of
the
season
so
you
see
i
mean
to
return
he
was
very
fortunate
in
meeting
you
spencer
said
the
manager
warmly
well
it
is
time
he
had
a
slice
of
luck
i
taken
a
fancy
to
the
old
fellow
one
night
in
the
forno
hut
he
told
me
something
of
his
story
i
guess
it
will
please
him
to
stop
at
the
maloja
for
awhile
he
told
you
about
his
daughter
came
the
tentative
question
not
all
i
am
afraid
there
was
no
difficulty
in
filling
in
the
blanks
i
heard
enough
to
make
me
respect
him
and
sympathize
with
his
troubles
the
manager
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
one
who
recalls
that
which
he
would
willingly
have
forgotten
such
incidents
are
rare
in
switzerland
he
said
i
well
remember
the
sensation
her
death
created
she
was
such
a
pretty
girl
the
young
men
at
pontresina
called
her
edelweiss
because
she
was
so
inaccessible
in
fact
poor
stampa
had
educated
her
beyond
her
station
and
that
is
not
always
good
for
a
woman
especially
in
these
quiet
valleys
where
knowledge
of
cattle
and
garden
produce
is
a
better
asset
than
speaking
french
and
playing
the
piano
spencer
agreed
he
could
name
other
districts
where
the
same
rule
held
good
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
spacious
hall
to
light
a
cigar
involuntarily
he
glanced
at
helen
she
met
his
gaze
and
said
something
to
bower
that
caused
the
latter
also
to
turn
and
look
she
has
read
mackenzie
letter
thought
spencer
taking
refuge
behind
a
cloud
of
smoke
it
will
be
bad
behavior
on
my
part
to
leave
the
hotel
without
making
my
bow
shall
i
go
to
her
now
or
wait
till
morning
he
reflected
that
helen
might
be
out
early
next
day
if
he
presented
his
introduction
at
once
she
would
probably
ask
him
to
sit
with
her
a
little
while
and
then
he
must
become
acquainted
with
bower
he
disliked
the
notion
but
he
saw
no
way
out
of
it
unless
indeed
helen
treated
him
with
the
chilling
abruptness
she
meted
out
to
other
men
in
the
hotel
who
tried
to
become
friendly
with
her
he
was
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
dispassionately
when
the
english
chaplain
approached
do
you
play
bridge
mr
spencer
he
asked
i
know
the
leads
and
call
on
the
least
provocation
was
the
reply
you
are
the
very
man
i
am
searching
for
and
i
have
the
authority
of
the
first
book
of
samuel
in
my
quest
well
now
that
is
the
last
place
in
which
i
should
expect
to
find
my
bridge
portrait
do
you
remember
how
saul
servants
asked
his
permission
to
out
a
man
who
is
a
cunning
player
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
doing
come
to
the
smoking
room
there
are
two
other
men
there
and
one
is
a
fellow
countryman
of
yours
the
rev
hare
was
a
genial
soul
a
somersetshire
vicar
who
took
his
annual
holiday
by
accepting
a
temporary
position
in
some
alpine
village
where
there
was
an
english
church
he
did
not
dream
that
he
was
acting
the
part
of
hermes
messenger
of
the
gods
at
that
moment
for
indeed
his
appearance
on
the
scene
just
then
changed
the
whole
trend
of
spencer
actions
what
a
delightful
place
this
is
he
went
on
as
they
walked
together
through
a
long
corridor
but
what
is
the
matter
with
the
people
they
do
mix
i
would
not
have
believed
that
there
were
so
many
prigs
in
the
british
isles
some
such
candid
opinion
had
occurred
to
spencer
but
being
an
american
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
might
be
mistaken
the
english
character
is
somewhat
adaptable
to
environment
i
have
heard
that
is
why
you
send
out
such
excellent
colonists
he
said
does
that
go
rather
to
prove
that
everybody
here
should
be
hail
fellow
well
met
not
at
all
they
take
their
pose
from
the
alps
snow
glaciers
hard
rock
you
know
that
is
the
subtlety
of
it
the
vicar
laughed
you
have
given
me
a
new
point
of
view
he
said
some
of
them
are
slippery
customers
too
yes
one
might
carry
the
parallel
a
long
way
but
here
we
are
now
mind
you
cut
me
as
a
partner
i
have
tried
the
others
and
found
them
severely
critical
as
bridge
players
you
look
a
stoic
the
vicar
had
his
wish
spencer
and
he
opposed
a
man
from
pittsburg
named
holt
and
dunston
an
englishman
while
the
latter
was
shuffling
the
cards
for
hare
deal
he
said
something
that
took
one
at
least
of
his
hearers
by
surprise
bower
has
turned
up
i
see
what
has
brought
him
to
the
engadine
at
this
time
of
year
i
ca
guess
unless
perhaps
he
is
interested
in
a
pretty
face
at
this
time
of
the
year
repeated
spencer
is
this
the
season
not
for
him
he
used
to
be
a
famous
climber
but
he
has
given
it
up
since
he
waxed
fat
and
prosperous
i
have
met
him
once
or
twice
at
moritz
in
the
winter
otherwise
he
usually
shows
up
in
the
fashionable
resorts
in
august
ostend
or
trouville
or
if
he
is
livery
vichy
or
anywhere
but
this
quiet
spot
bower
likes
excitement
too
he
often
opens
a
thousand
pound
bank
at
baccarat
whereas
people
are
shocked
in
maloja
at
seeing
hare
play
bridge
at
tenpence
a
hundred
i
leave
it
partner
broke
in
the
vicar
to
whom
the
game
was
the
thing
no
trumps
said
spencer
without
giving
the
least
heed
to
his
cards
it
was
true
his
eyes
were
resting
on
the
ace
king
and
queen
of
spades
but
his
mind
was
tortured
by
the
belief
that
by
his
fantastic
conceit
in
sending
helen
to
this
alpine
fastness
he
had
delivered
her
bound
to
the
vultures
double
no
trumps
said
dunston
gloating
over
the
possession
of
a
long
suit
of
hearts
and
three
aces
hare
looked
anxious
and
spencer
suddenly
awoke
to
the
situation
satisfied
he
said
holt
led
the
three
of
hearts
and
spencer
spread
his
cards
on
the
table
with
the
gravity
of
a
sioux
chief
in
addition
to
the
three
high
spades
he
held
six
others
really
gasped
the
parson
a
most
remarkable
declaration
yet
there
was
an
agitated
triumph
in
his
voice
that
was
not
pleasant
hearing
for
dunston
who
took
the
trick
with
the
ace
of
hearts
and
led
the
lowest
of
a
sequence
to
the
queen
got
him
panted
hare
producing
the
king
the
rest
was
easy
the
vicar
played
a
small
spade
and
scored
points
without
any
further
risk
it
is
magnificent
but
it
is
not
bridge
said
the
man
from
pittsburg
dunston
simply
glowered
partner
demanded
hare
timidly
may
i
ask
why
you
called
trumps
on
a
hand
like
that
thought
i
would
give
you
a
chance
of
distinguishing
yourself
replied
spencer
besides
that
sort
of
thing
rattles
your
opponents
at
the
beginning
of
a
game
keep
your
nerve
now
and
you
have
in
a
cleft
stick
as
it
happened
holt
made
a
no
trump
declaration
on
a
very
strong
hand
but
spencer
held
seven
clubs
headed
by
the
ace
and
king
he
doubled
holt
redoubled
spencer
doubled
again
hare
flushed
somewhat
allow
me
to
say
that
i
am
very
fond
of
bridge
but
i
can
not
take
part
in
a
game
that
savors
of
gambling
even
for
low
stakes
he
broke
in
shall
we
let
her
go
at
points
a
trick
spencer
asked
yep
snapped
holt
got
all
the
clubs
not
all
sufficient
perhaps
he
played
the
ace
dunston
laid
the
queen
and
knave
on
the
table
spencer
scored
the
winning
trick
before
his
adversary
obtained
an
opening
you
have
a
backbone
of
cast
steel
commented
dunston
who
was
an
do
you
play
baccarat
he
went
on
with
curious
eagerness
i
regret
to
state
that
my
education
was
completed
in
a
western
mining
camp
will
you
excuse
the
liberty
and
perhaps
hare
wo
listen
for
a
moment
but
i
will
finance
you
in
three
banks
of
a
thousand
each
either
banking
or
punting
if
you
promise
to
take
on
bower
i
can
arrange
it
easily
i
say
this
because
you
personally
may
not
care
to
play
for
high
sums
the
suggestion
was
astounding
coming
as
it
did
from
a
stranger
but
spencer
merely
said
you
do
like
bower
then
that
is
so
i
have
business
relations
with
him
occasionally
and
there
he
is
all
that
could
be
wished
but
i
have
seen
him
clean
out
more
than
one
youngster
ruthlessly
force
the
play
to
too
high
stakes
i
mean
i
think
you
could
take
his
measure
anyhow
i
am
prepared
to
back
you
i
leaving
here
ah
well
we
may
have
another
opportunity
if
so
my
offer
holds
guess
you
have
heard
that
spencer
is
the
man
who
bored
a
tunnel
through
the
rocky
mountains
said
holt
no
you
must
tell
me
about
it
sorry
hare
i
am
stopping
the
game
spencer
continued
to
have
amazing
good
fortune
and
he
played
with
skill
but
without
any
more
fireworks
at
the
close
of
the
sitting
the
vicar
said
cheerfully
you
are
not
a
ladies
man
spencer
you
know
the
old
proverb
lucky
at
cards
unlucky
in
love
but
let
me
hope
that
it
does
not
apply
in
your
case
talking
about
a
ladies
man
who
is
the
girl
your
friend
bower
dined
with
asked
holt
she
has
been
in
the
hotel
several
days
but
she
did
seem
to
be
acquainted
with
anybody
in
particular
until
he
blew
in
this
afternoon
she
is
a
miss
helen
wynton
said
the
vicar
i
like
her
very
much
from
what
little
i
have
seen
of
her
she
attended
both
services
on
sunday
and
i
happen
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
was
at
mass
in
the
roman
church
earlier
i
wanted
her
to
play
the
harmonium
next
sunday
but
she
declined
and
gave
me
her
reasons
too
may
i
ask
what
they
were
inquired
spencer
well
speaking
in
confidence
they
were
grievously
true
some
miserable
pandering
to
grundy
has
set
the
other
women
against
her
so
she
declined
to
thrust
herself
into
prominence
i
tried
to
talk
her
out
of
it
but
failed
who
is
grundy
anyhow
growled
holt
the
others
laughed
she
is
the
medusa
of
modern
life
explained
the
vicar
she
turns
to
stone
those
who
gaze
on
her
most
certainly
she
petrifies
all
good
feeling
and
christian
tolerance
why
i
actually
heard
a
woman
whose
conduct
is
not
usually
governed
by
what
i
hold
to
be
good
taste
sneer
at
miss
wynton
this
evening
murder
is
out
now
she
said
presence
explains
everything
yet
i
am
able
to
state
that
miss
wynton
was
quite
unprepared
for
his
arrival
by
chance
i
was
standing
on
the
steps
when
he
drove
up
to
the
hotel
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
the
words
they
used
that
neither
was
aware
that
the
other
was
in
maloja
spencer
leaned
over
toward
the
tell
you
what
he
said
i
changed
my
mind
about
the
trip
to
england
get
up
that
game
with
bower
i
stand
the
racket
myself
unless
you
want
to
go
half
shares
done
i
should
like
to
have
an
interest
in
it
not
that
i
am
pining
for
bower
money
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
win
ours
but
i
am
keen
on
giving
him
a
sharp
run
at
nice
last
january
not
a
soul
in
the
casino
would
go
banco
when
he
opened
a
big
bank
they
were
afraid
of
him
while
he
was
speaking
dunston
shrewd
eyes
dwelt
on
the
younger
man
unmoved
face
he
wondered
what
had
caused
this
sudden
veering
of
purpose
it
was
certainly
not
the
allurement
of
heavy
gambling
for
spencer
had
declined
the
proposal
as
coolly
as
he
now
accepted
it
being
a
man
of
the
world
he
thought
he
could
peer
beneath
the
mask
to
satisfy
himself
he
harked
back
to
the
personal
topic
by
the
way
does
anyone
know
who
miss
wynton
is
he
said
that
inveterate
gossip
vavasour
who
can
vouch
for
every
name
in
the
red
book
says
she
is
a
lady
journalist
that
at
any
rate
is
correct
said
the
vicar
in
fact
miss
wynton
herself
told
me
so
jolly
fine
girl
whatever
she
is
to
give
bower
his
due
he
has
always
been
a
person
of
taste
i
have
reason
to
believe
said
spencer
that
miss
acquaintance
with
bower
is
of
the
slightest
his
words
were
slow
and
clear
dunston
sure
now
that
his
guess
was
fairly
accurate
hastened
to
efface
an
unpleasant
impression
of
course
i
only
meant
that
if
bower
is
seen
talking
to
any
woman
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
she
is
a
pretty
one
he
explained
but
who
for
a
drink
perhaps
we
shall
meet
our
expected
opponent
in
the
bar
mr
spencer
i
have
some
letters
to
write
fix
that
game
for
or
next
day
and
i
be
on
hand
dunston
and
holt
paid
the
few
shillings
they
owed
and
went
out
hare
did
not
move
he
looked
anxious
almost
annoyed
it
is
exceedingly
ridiculous
how
circumstances
pass
beyond
a
man
control
occasionally
he
protested
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
until
this
evening
neither
bower
nor
dunston
was
known
to
you
mr
spencer
absolutely
correct
vicar
i
have
never
yet
spoken
to
bower
and
you
heard
all
that
passed
between
dunston
and
myself
then
my
harmless
invitation
to
you
to
join
in
a
game
at
cards
has
led
directly
to
an
arrangement
for
play
at
absurdly
high
figures
it
seems
to
me
hare
that
bower
tracks
and
mine
are
destined
to
cross
in
more
ways
than
one
in
the
near
future
said
spencer
coolly
but
the
vicar
was
not
to
be
switched
away
from
the
new
thought
that
was
troubling
him
i
will
not
ask
what
you
mean
he
said
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
american
my
chief
concern
is
the
outcome
of
my
share
in
this
evening
pleasant
amusement
i
can
not
shut
my
ears
to
the
fact
that
you
have
planned
the
loss
or
gain
of
some
thousands
of
pounds
on
the
turn
of
a
card
at
baccarat
if
it
is
disagreeable
to
you
how
can
it
be
otherwise
i
am
a
man
and
i
see
no
harm
whatever
in
playing
bridge
for
pennies
but
i
am
more
pained
than
i
care
to
confess
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
sequel
to
our
friendly
meeting
if
this
thing
happens
if
a
small
fortune
is
won
or
lost
merely
to
gratify
dunston
whim
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
never
touch
a
card
again
as
long
as
i
live
then
spencer
laughed
that
would
be
too
bad
hare
he
cried
make
your
mind
easy
the
game
is
off
count
on
me
for
the
tenpence
a
hundred
limit
after
dinner
now
that
is
quite
good
and
kind
of
you
dunston
made
me
very
miserable
by
his
mad
proposition
of
course
both
he
and
bower
are
rich
men
men
to
whom
a
few
thousand
pounds
are
of
little
importance
or
to
be
accurate
they
profess
not
to
care
whether
they
win
or
lose
though
their
wealth
is
not
squandered
so
heedlessly
when
it
is
wanted
for
some
really
deserving
object
but
perhaps
that
is
uncharitable
my
only
wish
is
to
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
your
generous
promise
is
bower
so
very
rich
then
have
you
met
him
before
he
is
a
reputed
millionaire
i
read
of
him
in
the
newspapers
at
times
in
my
small
country
parish
such
financial
luminaries
twinkle
from
a
far
sky
it
is
true
he
is
a
recent
light
he
made
a
great
deal
of
money
in
copper
i
believe
what
kind
of
character
do
you
give
him
good
bad
or
indifferent
hare
benevolent
features
showed
the
astonishment
that
thrilled
him
at
this
blunt
question
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
he
stammered
spencer
liked
this
cheery
vicar
and
resolved
to
trust
him
let
me
explain
he
said
you
and
i
agree
in
thinking
that
miss
wynton
is
an
uncommonly
nice
girl
i
am
not
on
her
visiting
list
at
present
so
my
judgment
is
altruistic
suppose
she
was
your
daughter
or
niece
would
you
care
to
see
her
left
to
that
man
mercies
the
clergyman
fidgeted
a
little
before
he
answered
spencer
was
a
stranger
to
him
yet
he
felt
drawn
toward
him
the
strong
clear
cut
face
won
confidence
if
it
was
the
will
of
heaven
i
would
sooner
see
her
in
the
grave
he
said
with
solemn
candor
spencer
rose
he
held
out
his
hand
i
guess
it
growing
late
he
cried
and
our
talk
has
swung
round
to
a
serious
point
sleep
well
hare
that
game
is
dead
off
as
he
passed
the
bar
he
heard
bower
smooth
well
rounded
accents
through
the
door
nothing
i
should
like
better
he
was
saying
are
you
tired
if
not
bring
your
friend
to
my
rooms
now
although
i
have
been
in
the
train
all
night
i
am
fit
as
a
fiddle
let
me
see
i
left
him
in
the
smoking
room
with
our
it
was
dunston
who
spoke
but
bower
broke
in
oh
keep
the
clergy
out
of
it
they
make
such
a
song
about
these
things
if
they
hear
of
them
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
he
is
not
there
he
will
be
in
his
room
he
is
two
doors
from
me
no
i
think
shall
i
fetch
him
do
by
all
means
by
jove
i
did
expect
to
get
any
decent
play
here
spencer
slipped
into
a
small
vestibule
where
he
had
left
a
hat
and
overcoat
he
remained
there
till
dunston
crossed
the
hall
and
entered
the
elevator
then
he
went
out
meaning
to
stroll
and
smoke
in
the
moonlight
for
an
hour
it
would
be
easier
to
back
out
of
the
promised
game
in
the
morning
than
at
that
moment
moreover
in
the
clear
still
air
he
could
plan
a
course
of
action
the
need
of
which
was
becoming
insistent
he
was
blessed
or
cursed
with
a
stubborn
will
and
he
knew
it
hitherto
it
had
been
exercised
on
a
theory
wrapped
in
hard
granite
and
the
granite
had
yielded
justifying
the
theory
now
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
a
woman
temperament
and
his
experience
of
that
elusive
and
complex
mixture
of
attributes
was
of
the
slightest
attractive
young
women
in
colorado
are
plentiful
as
cranberries
but
never
one
of
them
had
withdrawn
his
mind
eye
from
his
work
why
then
was
he
so
ready
now
to
devote
his
energies
to
the
safeguarding
of
helen
wynton
it
was
absurd
to
pretend
that
he
was
responsible
for
her
future
because
of
the
whim
that
sent
her
on
a
holiday
she
was
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
she
had
earned
her
own
living
before
he
met
her
she
had
risen
imperiously
above
the
petty
malice
displayed
by
some
of
the
residents
in
the
hotel
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
she
might
become
the
wife
of
a
man
highly
placed
and
wealthy
every
consideration
told
in
favor
of
a
policy
of
the
smoking
of
an
inch
of
good
cigar
placed
the
matter
in
such
a
convincing
light
that
spencer
was
half
resolved
to
abide
by
his
earlier
decision
and
leave
maloja
next
morning
but
the
other
half
made
up
of
inclination
pleaded
against
all
the
urging
of
expediency
he
deemed
the
vicar
an
honest
man
and
that
phrase
of
his
stuck
yet
whether
he
went
or
stayed
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
problem
lay
with
helen
herself
once
on
speaking
terms
with
her
he
could
form
a
more
decided
view
it
was
wonderful
how
one
estimate
of
a
man
or
woman
could
be
modified
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
conversation
well
he
would
settle
things
that
way
and
meanwhile
enjoy
the
beauty
of
a
wondrous
night
a
full
moon
was
flooding
the
landscape
with
a
brilliance
not
surpassed
in
the
crystal
atmosphere
of
denver
the
snow
capped
summit
of
the
cima
di
rosso
was
fit
to
be
a
peak
in
olympus
a
silver
throned
height
where
the
gods
sat
in
council
the
brooding
pines
perched
on
the
hillside
beyond
the
orlegna
looked
like
a
company
of
gigantic
birds
with
folded
wings
from
the
road
leading
to
the
village
he
could
hear
the
torrent
itself
singing
its
mad
song
of
freedom
after
escaping
from
the
icy
caverns
of
the
forno
glacier
quite
near
on
the
right
the
tiny
cascade
that
marks
the
first
seaward
flight
of
the
inn
mingled
its
sweet
melody
with
the
orchestral
thunder
of
the
more
distant
cataracts
plunging
down
the
precipices
toward
italy
it
was
a
night
when
one
might
listen
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
and
spencer
was
suddenly
jarred
into
unpleasant
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
by
the
raucous
voices
of
some
peasants
bawling
a
romansch
ballad
in
a
wayside
wine
house
turning
sharply
on
his
heel
he
took
the
road
by
the
lake
there
at
least
he
would
find
peace
from
the
strenuous
amours
of
margharita
as
trolled
by
the
revelers
he
had
not
gone
three
hundred
yards
before
he
saw
a
woman
standing
near
the
low
wall
that
guarded
the
embanked
highway
from
the
water
she
was
looking
at
the
dark
mirror
of
the
lake
and
seemed
to
be
identifying
the
stars
reflected
in
it
three
or
four
times
as
he
approached
she
tilted
her
head
back
and
gazed
at
the
sky
the
skirt
of
a
white
dress
was
visible
below
a
heavy
ulster
a
knitted
shawl
was
wrapped
loosely
over
her
hair
and
neck
and
the
ends
were
draped
deftly
across
her
shoulders
but
before
she
turned
to
see
who
was
coming
along
the
road
spencer
had
recognized
her
thus
in
a
sense
he
was
a
trifle
the
more
prepared
of
the
two
for
this
unforeseen
meeting
and
he
hailed
it
as
supplying
the
answer
to
his
doubts
now
said
he
to
himself
i
shall
know
in
ten
seconds
whether
or
not
i
travel
west
by
north
helen
did
not
avert
her
glance
instantly
nor
did
she
at
once
resume
a
stroll
evidently
interrupted
to
take
in
deep
breaths
of
the
beauty
of
the
scene
that
was
encouraging
to
the
american
she
expected
him
to
speak
to
her
he
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
if
he
was
mistaken
he
did
not
wish
to
alarm
her
if
you
will
pardon
the
somewhat
unorthodox
time
and
place
i
should
like
to
make
myself
known
to
you
miss
wynton
he
said
lifting
his
cap
you
are
mr
spencer
she
answered
with
a
frank
smile
yes
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
from
mr
mackenzie
so
have
i
what
do
we
do
next
exchange
letters
mine
is
in
the
hotel
suppose
we
just
shake
well
that
is
certainly
the
most
direct
way
their
hands
met
they
were
both
aware
of
a
whiff
of
nervousness
for
some
reason
the
commonplace
greetings
of
politeness
fell
awkwardly
from
their
lips
in
such
a
predicament
a
woman
may
always
be
trusted
to
find
the
way
out
it
is
rather
absurd
that
we
should
be
saying
how
pleased
we
are
that
mackenzie
thought
of
writing
those
letters
while
in
reality
i
am
horribly
conscious
that
i
ought
not
to
be
here
at
all
and
you
are
probably
thinking
that
i
am
quite
an
amazing
person
and
helen
laughed
light
heartedly
that
is
part
of
my
thought
said
spencer
wo
you
tell
me
the
remainder
may
i
please
do
i
am
in
chastened
mood
i
wish
i
was
skilled
in
the
trick
of
words
then
i
might
say
something
real
cute
as
it
is
i
can
only
supply
a
sort
of
condensed
statement
something
about
a
nymph
a
moonlit
lake
the
spirit
of
the
glen
nice
catchy
phrases
every
one
with
a
line
thrown
in
from
shelley
about
an
maiden
with
white
fire
laden
let
me
go
back
a
hundred
yards
miss
wynton
and
i
shall
return
with
the
whole
thing
in
order
with
such
material
i
believe
you
would
bring
me
a
sonnet
no
i
hail
from
the
wild
and
woolly
west
where
life
itself
is
a
poem
so
i
stick
to
prose
there
is
a
queer
sort
of
kink
in
human
nature
to
account
for
that
on
the
principle
that
a
londoner
never
hears
the
roar
of
london
i
suppose
exactly
an
old
lady
i
know
once
came
across
a
remarkable
instance
of
it
she
watched
a
the
real
article
with
all
the
scenic
accessories
and
when
a
half
drowned
sailor
was
dragged
ashore
she
asked
him
how
he
felt
at
that
awful
moment
and
what
do
you
think
he
said
very
wet
laughed
helen
no
that
is
the
other
story
this
man
said
he
was
very
dry
ah
the
one
step
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
which
reminds
me
that
if
i
remain
here
much
longer
talking
nonsense
i
shall
lose
the
good
opinion
i
am
sure
you
have
formed
of
me
from
letter
why
it
must
be
after
eleven
are
you
going
any
farther
or
will
you
walk
with
me
to
the
hotel
if
you
will
allow
me
indeed
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
i
came
out
to
escape
my
own
thoughts
did
you
ever
meet
such
an
unsociable
lot
of
people
as
our
fellow
boarders
spencer
if
it
was
not
for
my
work
and
the
fact
that
i
have
taken
my
room
for
a
month
i
should
hie
me
forthwith
to
the
beaten
track
of
the
vulgar
but
good
natured
tourist
why
not
go
let
me
help
you
to
map
out
a
tour
then
i
shall
know
precisely
where
to
waylay
you
for
i
feel
the
chill
here
too
i
wish
i
could
fall
in
with
the
first
part
of
your
proposal
though
the
second
rather
suggests
that
you
regard
mackenzie
letter
of
introduction
as
a
letter
of
marque
at
any
rate
i
am
an
avowed
pirate
he
could
not
help
retorting
but
to
keep
strictly
to
business
why
not
quit
if
you
feel
like
wandering
because
i
was
sent
here
on
a
journalistic
mission
which
i
understand
less
now
than
when
i
received
it
in
london
of
course
i
am
delighted
with
the
place
it
is
the
people
i
kick
at
is
that
a
quite
proper
americanism
it
seems
to
fit
the
present
case
like
a
glove
or
may
i
say
like
a
shoe
now
you
are
laughing
at
me
inwardly
of
course
and
i
agree
with
you
ladies
should
not
use
slang
nor
should
they
promenade
alone
in
swiss
valleys
by
moonlight
my
excuse
is
that
i
did
not
feel
sleepy
and
the
moon
tempted
me
good
night
they
were
yet
some
little
distance
from
the
hotel
and
spencer
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
this
sudden
dismissal
she
saw
the
look
of
bewilderment
in
his
face
i
have
found
a
back
stairs
door
she
explained
with
a
smile
i
really
do
think
i
should
have
dared
to
come
out
at
ten
if
i
had
to
pass
the
gorgons
in
the
foyer
she
flitted
away
by
a
side
path
leaving
spencer
more
convinced
than
ever
that
he
had
blundered
egregiously
in
dragging
this
sedate
and
charming
girl
from
the
quiet
round
of
existence
in
london
to
the
artificial
life
of
the
kursaal
some
feeling
of
unrest
had
driven
her
forth
to
commune
with
the
stars
was
she
asking
herself
why
she
was
denied
the
luxuries
showered
on
the
creatures
whose
malicious
tongues
were
busy
the
instant
bower
set
foot
in
the
hotel
it
would
be
an
ill
outcome
of
his
innocent
subterfuge
if
she
returned
to
england
discontented
and
rebellious
she
was
in
chastened
mood
she
had
said
he
wondered
why
had
bower
been
too
confident
too
sure
of
his
prey
to
guard
his
tongue
of
all
the
unlooked
for
developments
that
could
possibly
be
bound
up
with
the
harmless
piece
of
midsummer
madness
that
sent
helen
wynton
to
switzerland
surely
this
presence
was
the
most
irritating
and
perplexing
then
from
the
road
came
another
stanza
from
the
wine
bibbers
now
homeward
bound
they
were
still
howling
about
margharita
in
long
sustained
cadences
and
spencer
knew
his
faust
it
was
to
the
moon
that
the
lovesick
maiden
confided
her
dreams
and
mephisto
was
at
hand
to
jog
the
elbow
of
his
bewitched
philosopher
at
exactly
the
right
moment
spencer
threw
his
cigar
into
the
gurgling
rivulet
of
the
inn
he
condemned
switzerland
and
the
upper
engadine
and
the
very
great
majority
of
the
guests
in
the
kursaal
in
one
emphatic
malediction
and
went
to
his
room
hoping
to
sleep
but
actually
to
lie
awake
for
hours
and
puzzle
his
brains
in
vain
effort
to
evolve
a
satisfying
sequel
to
the
queer
combination
of
events
he
had
set
in
motion
when
he
ran
bare
headed
into
the
strand
after
bower
motor
car
chapter
viii
shadows
it
is
a
glorious
morning
if
the
weather
holds
your
first
visit
to
the
real
alps
should
be
memorable
said
bower
helen
had
just
descended
the
long
flight
of
steps
in
front
of
the
hotel
a
tender
purple
light
filled
the
valley
the
nearer
hills
were
silhouetted
boldly
against
a
sky
of
primrose
and
pink
but
the
misty
depths
where
the
lake
lurked
beneath
the
pines
had
not
yet
yielded
wholly
to
the
triumph
of
the
new
day
the
air
had
a
cold
life
in
it
that
invigorated
while
it
chilled
it
resembled
some
of
rare
vintage
its
fragrant
vivacity
was
ready
to
burst
forth
at
the
first
encouraging
hint
of
a
kindlier
temperature
why
that
dubious
clause
as
to
the
weather
asked
helen
looking
at
the
golden
shafts
of
sunlight
on
the
topmost
crags
of
corvatsch
and
the
piz
della
margna
those
far
off
summits
were
so
startlingly
vivid
in
outline
that
they
seemed
to
be
more
accessible
than
the
mist
shrouded
ravines
cleaving
their
dun
sides
it
needed
an
effort
of
the
imagination
to
correct
the
erring
testimony
of
the
eye
the
moods
of
the
hills
are
variable
my
lady
femininely
fickle
in
fact
there
is
a
proverb
that
contrasts
the
wind
with
woman
mind
but
the
disillusioned
male
who
framed
it
evidently
possessed
little
knowledge
of
weather
changes
in
the
high
alps
or
else
he
did
you
beguile
me
out
of
my
cozy
room
at
six
on
a
frosty
morning
to
regale
me
with
stale
jibes
at
my
sex
perish
the
thought
miss
wynton
my
only
intent
was
to
explain
that
the
ancient
proverb
maker
meaning
to
be
rude
might
have
found
a
better
simile
meanwhile
i
am
so
cold
that
the
only
mood
left
in
my
composition
is
one
of
impatience
to
be
moving
well
i
am
ready
but
where
is
our
guide
he
has
gone
on
in
front
with
the
porter
porter
what
is
the
man
carrying
the
wherewithal
to
refresh
ourselves
when
we
reach
the
hut
oh
said
helen
i
had
no
idea
that
mountaineering
was
such
a
business
i
thought
the
essentials
were
a
packet
of
sandwiches
and
a
flask
you
will
please
not
be
flippant
climbing
is
serious
work
and
you
must
moderate
your
pace
if
you
walk
at
that
rate
from
here
to
forno
you
will
be
very
very
ill
before
you
reach
the
hut
ill
how
absurd
not
only
absurd
but
disagreeable
far
worse
than
crossing
the
channel
even
old
hands
like
me
are
not
free
from
mountain
sickness
though
it
seizes
us
at
higher
altitudes
than
we
shall
reach
in
the
case
of
a
novice
anything
in
the
nature
of
hurrying
during
the
outward
journey
is
an
unfailing
factor
they
were
crossing
the
golf
links
and
the
smooth
path
was
tempting
to
a
good
walker
helen
smiled
as
she
accommodated
herself
to
slower
stride
though
the
man
might
possess
experience
the
woman
had
the
advantage
of
youth
the
unattainable
and
this
wonderful
hour
after
dawn
was
stirring
its
ichor
in
her
veins
i
suppose
that
is
what
stampa
meant
when
he
took
and
sure
for
his
motto
she
said
stampa
who
is
stampa
there
was
a
sudden
rasp
of
iron
in
his
voice
as
a
rule
bower
spoke
with
a
cultivated
languor
that
almost
veiled
the
staccato
accents
of
the
man
of
affairs
helen
was
so
surprised
by
this
unwarranted
clang
of
anger
that
she
looked
at
him
with
wide
open
eyes
he
is
the
driver
i
told
you
of
the
man
who
took
the
wheel
off
my
carriage
during
the
journey
from
moritz
she
explained
oh
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
to
forget
but
by
the
way
did
you
mention
his
name
no
i
think
not
someone
interrupted
me
dunston
came
and
spoke
to
you
he
laughed
gayly
and
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
the
keen
air
he
was
carrying
his
ice
ax
over
his
left
shoulder
with
his
right
hand
he
brushed
away
a
disturbing
thought
by
jove
yes
dunston
dragged
me
off
to
open
a
bank
at
baccarat
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
won
five
hundred
pounds
i
am
glad
you
won
but
who
lost
so
much
money
dunston
dropped
the
greater
part
of
it
your
american
friend
spencer
was
rather
inclined
to
brag
of
his
prowess
in
that
direction
it
appears
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
announce
his
willingness
to
play
for
four
figures
but
he
backed
out
of
it
do
you
mean
that
spencer
wanted
to
stake
a
thousand
pounds
on
a
single
game
at
cards
evidently
he
did
not
want
to
do
it
but
he
talked
about
it
yet
he
impressed
me
as
being
a
very
and
sensible
young
man
said
helen
decisively
here
young
lady
i
must
call
you
to
account
in
what
category
do
you
place
me
then
oh
you
are
different
i
disapprove
of
anyone
playing
for
such
high
stakes
but
i
suppose
you
are
used
to
it
and
can
afford
it
whereas
a
man
who
has
his
way
to
make
in
the
world
would
be
exceedingly
foolish
to
do
such
a
thing
pray
how
did
you
come
to
measure
the
extent
of
spencer
finances
dear
me
did
i
say
that
i
am
sorry
of
course
i
had
no
wish
to
speak
offensively
what
i
mean
is
that
he
may
be
quite
as
well
able
to
run
a
big
bank
at
baccarat
as
i
am
he
was
telling
me
yesterday
of
his
early
struggles
to
gain
a
footing
in
some
mining
community
in
colorado
and
the
impression
his
words
left
on
me
was
that
he
is
still
far
from
wealthy
that
is
as
one
understands
the
term
here
we
are
at
the
footpath
shall
we
follow
it
and
scramble
up
out
of
the
ravine
or
do
you
prefer
the
carriage
road
the
footpath
please
but
before
we
drop
the
subject
of
cards
which
is
unquestionably
out
of
place
on
a
morning
like
this
let
me
say
that
perhaps
i
have
done
the
american
an
injustice
dunston
is
given
to
exaggeration
he
has
so
little
control
over
his
face
that
it
is
rank
robbery
to
bet
with
him
such
a
man
is
apt
to
run
to
extremes
it
may
be
that
spencer
was
only
talking
through
his
hat
as
they
say
in
new
york
helen
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
rejecting
this
version
of
the
story
her
perceptive
faculties
always
well
developed
were
strung
to
high
tension
in
maloja
the
social
pinpricks
inflicted
there
had
rendered
her
more
alert
more
cautious
than
was
her
wont
she
was
quite
sure
for
instance
judging
from
a
number
of
slight
indications
that
spencer
was
deliberately
avoiding
any
opportunity
of
making
acquaintance
more
than
once
when
an
introduction
seemed
to
be
imminent
the
american
effaced
himself
other
men
in
the
hotel
were
not
like
that
they
rather
sought
the
great
man
company
she
wondered
if
bower
had
noticed
it
despite
his
candid
almost
generous
disclaimer
of
motive
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
hostility
in
his
words
that
suggested
a
feeling
of
pique
she
climbed
the
rocky
path
in
silence
until
bower
spoke
again
how
do
the
boots
go
he
asked
splendidly
thanks
it
was
exceedingly
kind
of
you
to
take
such
trouble
about
them
i
had
no
idea
one
had
to
wear
such
heavy
nails
and
that
tip
of
yours
about
the
extra
stockings
is
excellent
you
will
acknowledge
the
benefit
most
during
the
descent
i
have
known
people
become
absolutely
lame
on
the
home
journey
through
wearing
boots
only
just
large
enough
for
ordinary
walking
as
for
the
clamping
of
the
nails
over
the
edges
of
the
soles
the
sharp
stones
render
that
imperative
when
you
have
crossed
a
moraine
or
two
and
a
peculiarly
nasty
that
exists
beyond
the
hut
if
we
have
time
to
make
an
easy
ascent
you
will
understand
the
need
of
extra
strong
footwear
helen
favored
him
with
a
shy
smile
long
hours
of
reading
have
revealed
the
nature
of
a
moraine
she
said
but
please
what
is
a
a
slope
of
loose
stones
let
me
see
what
do
they
call
it
in
scotland
and
cumberland
ah
yes
a
scree
on
the
french
side
of
the
alps
the
same
thing
is
known
as
a
how
well
you
know
this
country
and
its
ways
have
you
climbed
many
of
the
well
known
peaks
some
years
ago
i
scored
my
century
beyond
twelve
thousand
feet
that
is
pretty
fair
for
an
amateur
have
you
done
the
matterhorn
yes
four
times
once
i
followed
tyndall
example
and
converted
the
summit
into
a
pass
between
switzerland
and
italy
how
delightful
i
suppose
you
have
met
many
of
the
famous
guides
he
laughed
pleasantly
one
does
not
attempt
the
cervin
or
the
jungfrau
without
the
best
men
and
in
my
time
there
were
not
twenty
all
told
i
had
a
long
talk
with
our
present
guide
last
night
and
found
i
had
used
many
a
track
he
had
only
seen
from
the
valley
then
a
loud
toot
on
a
cowhorn
close
at
hand
interrupted
her
the
artist
was
a
small
boy
he
appeared
to
be
waiting
expectantly
on
a
hillock
for
someone
who
came
not
is
that
a
signal
she
asked
yes
he
is
a
or
cowherd
another
word
for
your
alpine
vocabulary
the
burgher
whose
cattle
he
will
drive
to
the
pasture
has
probably
arranged
to
meet
him
here
bower
was
always
an
interesting
and
well
informed
companion
launched
now
into
a
congenial
topic
he
gave
helen
a
thoroughly
entertaining
lecture
on
the
customs
of
a
swiss
commune
he
pointed
out
the
successive
tiers
of
pastures
told
her
their
names
and
seasons
of
use
and
even
hummed
some
verses
of
the
cow
songs
or
which
the
men
sing
to
the
cattle
addressing
each
animal
by
name
an
hour
passed
pleasantly
in
this
manner
their
guide
a
man
named
josef
barth
and
the
porter
who
answered
to
karl
awaited
them
at
the
milk
chalet
by
the
side
of
lake
cavloccio
bower
evidently
accustomed
to
the
leadership
of
expeditions
of
this
sort
tested
their
ice
axes
and
examined
the
ropes
slung
to
barth
rucksack
the
forno
is
a
glacier
he
explained
to
helen
but
it
is
always
advisable
to
make
sure
that
your
appliances
are
in
good
order
that
you
are
carrying
was
made
by
the
best
blacksmith
in
grindelwald
and
you
can
depend
on
its
soundness
but
these
men
are
so
familiar
with
their
surroundings
that
they
often
provide
themselves
with
frayed
ropes
and
damaged
axes
in
addition
to
my
boots
therefore
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
a
special
brand
of
ice
ax
she
cried
your
gratitude
now
is
as
nothing
to
the
ecstasy
you
will
display
when
karl
unpacks
his
load
he
answered
lightly
now
miss
wynton
you
know
the
path
to
the
glacier
already
do
you
i
have
been
to
its
foot
twice
then
you
go
in
front
there
is
no
room
to
walk
two
abreast
before
we
tackle
the
ice
we
will
call
a
halt
for
refreshments
from
that
point
till
the
glacier
was
reached
the
climb
was
laboriously
simple
there
was
no
difficulty
and
not
the
slightest
risk
even
for
a
child
but
the
heavy
gradient
and
the
rarefied
air
made
it
almost
impossible
to
sustain
a
conversation
unless
the
speakers
dawdled
helen
often
found
herself
many
yards
in
advance
of
the
others
she
simply
could
not
help
breasting
the
steeper
portions
of
the
track
she
was
drawn
forward
by
an
intense
eagerness
to
begin
the
real
business
of
the
day
bower
did
not
seek
to
restrain
her
he
thought
her
high
spirits
admirable
and
his
gaze
dwelt
appreciatively
on
her
graceful
poise
as
she
stopped
on
the
crest
of
some
small
ravine
and
looked
back
at
the
plodders
beneath
attractive
at
all
times
she
was
bewitching
that
morning
to
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
his
athletic
tastes
she
wore
a
white
knitted
jersey
and
a
short
skirt
a
costume
seemingly
devised
to
reveal
the
lines
of
a
slender
waist
and
supple
limbs
a
white
tam
o
shanter
was
tied
firmly
over
her
glossy
brown
hair
with
a
silk
motor
veil
and
the
stout
boots
which
she
had
surveyed
so
ruefully
when
bower
brought
them
to
her
on
the
previous
evening
after
interviewing
the
village
shoemaker
were
by
no
means
so
cumbrous
in
use
as
her
unaccustomed
eyes
had
deemed
them
even
the
phlegmatic
guide
was
stirred
to
gruff
appreciation
when
he
saw
her
vault
on
to
a
large
flat
boulder
in
order
to
examine
an
iron
cross
that
surmounted
it
gott
he
grunted
that
englishwoman
is
as
surefooted
as
a
chamois
but
helen
had
found
a
name
and
a
date
on
a
triangular
strip
of
metal
attached
to
the
cross
why
has
this
memorial
been
placed
here
she
asked
bower
appealed
to
barth
but
he
shook
his
head
karl
gave
details
a
man
fell
on
the
cima
del
largo
they
carried
him
here
and
he
died
on
that
rock
poor
fellow
some
of
the
joyous
light
left
helen
face
she
had
passed
the
cross
before
and
had
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
votive
offerings
so
common
by
the
wayside
in
catholic
countries
knowing
that
in
this
part
of
switzerland
the
italian
element
predominated
among
the
peasants
we
get
a
fine
view
of
the
cima
del
largo
from
the
said
bower
unconcernedly
helen
picked
a
little
blue
flower
that
nestled
at
the
base
of
the
rock
she
pinned
it
to
her
jersey
without
comment
sometimes
the
callousness
of
a
man
was
helpful
and
the
shadow
of
a
bygone
tragedy
was
out
of
keeping
with
the
glow
of
this
delightful
valley
the
curving
mass
of
the
glacier
was
now
clearly
visible
it
looked
like
some
marble
staircase
meant
to
be
trodden
only
by
immortals
ever
broadening
and
ascending
until
it
filled
the
whole
width
of
the
rift
between
the
hills
it
seemed
to
mount
upward
to
infinity
the
sidelong
rays
of
the
sun
peeping
over
the
shoulders
of
forno
and
roseg
tinted
the
great
ice
river
with
a
sapphire
blue
while
its
higher
reaches
glistened
as
though
studded
with
gigantic
diamonds
near
at
hand
where
the
orlegna
rushed
noisily
from
thraldom
the
broken
surface
was
somber
and
repellent
in
color
a
dull
gray
owing
to
the
accumulation
of
winter
débris
and
summer
dust
it
had
the
aspect
of
decay
and
death
it
was
jagged
and
gaunt
and
haggard
the
far
flung
piles
of
the
white
moraine
imposed
a
stony
barrier
against
its
farther
progress
but
that
unpleasing
glimpse
of
disruption
was
quickly
dispelled
by
the
magnificent
volume
and
virgin
purity
of
the
glacier
as
a
whole
helen
tried
to
imagine
herself
two
miles
distant
a
tiny
speck
on
the
great
floor
of
the
pass
that
was
the
only
way
to
grasp
its
stupendous
size
though
she
knew
that
it
mounted
through
five
miles
of
rock
strewn
ravine
before
it
touched
the
precipitous
saddle
along
which
runs
the
border
line
between
italy
and
switzerland
karl
sigh
of
relief
as
he
deposited
his
heavy
load
on
a
tablelike
boulder
brought
helen
back
from
the
land
of
dreams
to
this
sturdy
peasant
the
wondrous
forno
merely
represented
a
day
hard
work
at
an
agreed
sum
of
ten
francs
for
carrying
nearly
half
a
hundredweight
and
a
liberal
if
the
voyageurs
were
satisfied
sandwiches
and
a
glass
of
wine
diluted
with
water
brought
by
the
guide
from
a
neighboring
rill
glacier
water
being
used
only
as
a
last
resource
were
delectable
after
a
steady
two
hours
walk
the
early
morning
meal
of
coffee
and
a
roll
had
lost
some
of
its
flavor
when
consumed
apparently
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
helen
was
ready
now
for
her
breakfast
while
they
were
eating
bower
and
josef
barth
cast
glances
at
some
wisps
of
cloud
drifting
slowly
over
the
crests
of
the
southern
hills
nothing
was
said
the
guide
read
his
patron
wishes
correctly
unless
some
cause
far
more
imperative
than
a
slight
mist
intervened
the
day
programme
must
not
be
abandoned
so
there
was
no
loitering
the
sun
was
almost
in
the
valley
and
the
glacier
must
be
crossed
before
the
work
of
the
night
frost
was
undone
when
they
stepped
from
the
moraine
on
to
the
ice
barth
led
helen
followed
bower
came
next
with
karl
in
the
rear
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
crisp
crunching
sound
of
the
hobnails
amid
the
loose
fragments
on
the
surface
and
the
ring
of
the
butt
on
the
solid
mass
beneath
helen
might
have
fancied
that
she
was
walking
up
an
easy
slope
any
delusion
on
that
point
however
was
promptly
dispelled
by
a
glimpse
of
a
narrow
crevasse
that
split
the
foot
of
the
glacier
lengthwise
she
peered
into
its
depths
awesomely
it
resembled
a
toothless
mouth
gaping
slowly
open
ready
enough
to
swallow
her
but
too
inert
to
put
forth
the
necessary
effort
and
the
thought
reminded
her
of
something
she
halted
and
turned
to
bower
ought
we
not
to
be
roped
she
asked
he
laughed
with
the
quiet
confidence
of
the
expert
mountaineer
why
he
cried
the
way
is
clear
one
does
not
walk
into
a
crevasse
with
one
eyes
open
but
stampa
told
me
that
i
should
refuse
to
advance
a
yard
on
ice
or
difficult
rock
without
being
roped
stampa
your
cab
driver
there
was
no
reason
that
she
could
fathom
why
her
elderly
name
should
be
repeated
with
such
scornful
emphasis
ah
yes
he
is
that
because
he
is
lame
she
protested
but
he
was
one
of
the
most
famous
guides
in
zermatt
years
ago
she
swung
round
and
appealed
to
barth
who
was
wondering
why
his
employers
were
stopping
before
they
had
climbed
twenty
feet
are
you
from
zermatt
she
demanded
no
from
pontresina
zermatt
is
a
long
way
from
here
but
you
know
some
of
the
zermatt
men
i
suppose
have
you
ever
heard
of
christian
stampa
most
certainly
my
father
helped
him
to
build
the
first
hut
on
the
hörnli
ridge
old
stampa
chimed
in
karl
from
beneath
it
will
be
long
ere
he
is
forgotten
i
was
one
of
four
who
carried
him
down
from
corvatsch
to
the
day
after
he
fell
he
was
making
the
descent
by
night
a
mad
thing
to
do
and
there
was
murder
in
his
heart
they
said
but
i
never
believed
it
we
shared
a
bottle
of
monte
pulciano
only
yesterday
just
for
the
sake
of
old
times
and
he
was
as
merry
as
hans
von
rippach
himself
bower
was
stooping
so
helen
could
not
see
his
face
he
seemed
to
be
fumbling
with
a
boot
lace
you
hear
mr
bower
she
cried
i
am
quoting
no
mean
authority
he
did
not
answer
he
had
untied
the
lace
and
was
readjusting
it
the
girl
realized
that
to
a
man
of
his
portly
build
his
present
attitude
was
not
conducive
to
speech
it
had
an
additional
effect
which
did
not
suggest
itself
to
her
the
effort
thus
demanded
from
heart
and
lungs
might
bring
back
the
blood
to
a
face
blanched
by
a
deadly
fear
karl
was
stocked
with
reminiscences
of
stampa
i
remember
the
time
when
people
said
christian
was
the
best
man
in
the
bernina
he
said
he
would
never
go
back
to
the
valais
after
his
daughter
died
it
was
a
strange
thing
that
he
should
come
to
grief
on
a
cowherd
track
like
that
over
corvatsch
but
etta
affair
snarled
bower
straightening
himself
suddenly
his
dark
eyes
shot
such
a
gleam
of
lambent
fury
at
the
porter
that
the
jaw
fell
the
words
were
frozen
on
his
lips
he
could
not
have
been
stricken
dumb
more
effectually
had
he
come
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
horrific
sprites
described
in
the
folklore
of
the
hills
helen
was
surprised
what
had
poor
karl
done
that
he
should
be
bidden
so
fiercely
to
hold
his
tongue
then
she
thought
that
bower
must
have
recalled
stampa
history
and
feared
that
perhaps
the
outspoken
peasant
might
enter
into
a
piquant
account
of
some
village
scandal
a
chambermaid
in
the
hotel
questioned
about
stampa
had
told
her
that
the
daughter
he
loved
so
greatly
had
committed
suicide
really
she
ought
to
be
grateful
to
her
companion
for
saving
her
from
a
passing
embarrassment
but
she
had
the
tact
not
to
drop
the
subject
too
quickly
if
barth
and
you
agree
that
roping
is
unnecessary
of
course
i
have
a
word
to
say
in
the
matter
she
volunteered
it
was
rather
absurd
of
me
to
mention
it
in
the
first
instance
no
you
were
right
i
have
never
seen
stampa
but
his
name
is
familiar
it
occurs
in
most
alpine
records
barth
fix
the
rope
before
we
go
farther
the
wishes
it
the
rush
of
color
induced
by
physical
effort
effort
of
a
tensity
that
helen
was
wholly
unaware
of
was
ebbing
now
before
a
numbing
terror
that
had
come
to
stay
his
face
was
drawn
and
livid
his
voice
had
the
metallic
ring
in
it
that
the
girl
had
detected
once
already
that
day
again
she
experienced
a
sense
of
bewilderment
that
he
should
regard
a
trivial
thing
so
seriously
she
was
not
a
child
the
world
of
pulsated
with
far
too
many
stories
of
tragic
passion
that
she
should
be
shielded
so
determinedly
from
any
hint
of
an
episode
that
doubtless
wrung
the
heart
core
of
this
quiet
valley
one
day
in
august
sixteen
years
ago
in
some
slight
degree
bower
paroxysm
of
anger
was
a
reflection
on
her
own
good
taste
for
she
had
unwittingly
given
rise
to
it
nevertheless
she
felt
indebted
to
him
to
extricate
both
bower
and
herself
from
an
awkward
situation
she
took
a
keen
interest
in
method
of
adjusting
the
rope
the
man
did
not
show
any
amazement
at
bower
order
he
was
there
to
earn
his
fee
had
these
mad
english
told
him
to
cut
steps
up
the
gentle
slope
in
front
he
would
have
obeyed
without
protest
though
it
was
more
than
strange
that
this
much
traveled
should
adopt
such
a
needless
precaution
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
barth
guidance
a
blind
cripple
could
have
surmounted
the
first
kilometer
of
the
forno
glacier
the
track
lay
close
to
the
left
bank
of
the
moraine
it
curved
slightly
to
the
right
and
soon
the
exquisite
panorama
of
monte
roseg
the
cima
di
rosso
monte
sissone
piz
torrone
and
the
castello
group
opened
up
before
the
climbers
helen
was
enchanted
twice
she
half
turned
to
address
some
question
to
bower
but
on
each
occasion
she
happened
to
catch
him
in
the
act
of
swallowing
some
brandy
from
a
flask
governed
by
an
unaccountable
timidity
she
pretended
not
to
notice
his
actions
and
diverted
her
words
to
barth
who
told
her
the
names
of
the
peaks
and
pointed
to
the
junctions
of
minor
ice
fields
with
the
main
artery
of
the
forno
bower
did
not
utter
a
syllable
until
they
struck
out
toward
the
center
of
the
glacier
a
crevasse
some
ten
feet
in
width
and
seemingly
hundreds
of
feet
deep
barred
the
way
but
a
bridge
of
ice
covered
with
snow
offered
safe
transit
the
snow
carpet
showed
that
a
number
of
climbers
had
passed
quite
recently
in
both
directions
even
helen
somewhat
awed
by
the
dimensions
of
the
rift
understood
that
the
existence
of
this
natural
arch
was
as
well
recognized
by
alpinists
as
waterloo
bridge
is
known
to
dwellers
on
the
south
side
of
the
thames
now
miss
wynton
you
should
experience
your
first
real
thrill
said
bower
this
bridge
forms
here
every
year
at
this
season
and
an
army
might
cross
in
safety
it
is
the
genuine
article
the
first
and
strongest
of
a
series
yet
here
you
cross
the
rubicon
a
mixture
of
metaphors
is
allowable
in
high
altitudes
you
know
helen
almost
startled
at
first
by
the
unaffected
naturalness
of
his
words
was
unfeignedly
relieved
at
finding
him
restored
to
the
normal
usually
his
supply
of
badinage
was
unceasing
he
knew
exactly
when
and
how
to
season
it
with
more
serious
statements
it
is
this
rare
quality
that
makes
tolerable
a
long
day
solitude
illustration
she
flourished
her
ice
axe
bravely
i
am
not
cæsar
wife
she
replied
but
for
the
credit
of
womankind
in
general
i
shall
act
as
though
i
was
above
suspicion
of
nervousness
she
did
not
look
round
barth
was
moving
quickly
and
she
had
no
desire
to
burden
him
with
a
drag
on
the
rope
when
she
was
in
the
center
of
the
narrow
causeway
a
snow
cornice
in
the
lip
of
the
crevasse
detached
itself
under
the
growing
heat
of
the
sun
and
shivered
down
into
the
green
darkness
the
incident
brought
her
heart
into
her
mouth
it
served
as
a
reminder
that
this
solid
ice
river
was
really
in
a
state
of
constant
change
and
movement
bower
laughed
with
all
his
customary
gayety
of
manner
that
came
at
a
dramatic
moment
he
said
too
bad
it
could
not
let
you
pass
without
giving
you
a
quake
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
ah
but
i
can
read
your
thoughts
there
is
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
hemp
is
a
you
are
willfully
misunderstanding
me
he
retorted
no
i
honestly
believed
you
felt
the
rope
quiver
a
little
alas
it
is
the
atmosphere
my
compliments
fall
on
idle
ears
barth
interrupted
this
play
of
harmless
chaff
by
jerking
some
remark
over
his
shoulder
looks
like
a
he
said
gruffly
nonsense
said
bower
a
bank
of
mist
the
sun
will
soon
melt
it
it
a
right
enough
chimed
in
karl
who
had
recovered
his
power
of
speech
that
is
why
the
boy
was
blowing
his
horn
to
show
he
was
bringing
the
cattle
home
well
then
push
on
the
sooner
we
are
in
the
hut
the
better
please
what
is
a
asked
helen
when
the
men
had
nothing
more
to
say
a
word
i
would
have
wished
to
add
later
to
your
alpine
phrase
book
it
means
a
storm
a
blizzard
should
we
not
return
at
once
in
that
event
what
who
said
just
now
she
was
not
afraid
but
a
storm
in
such
a
place
these
fellows
smell
a
in
every
little
cloud
from
the
southwest
we
may
have
some
wind
and
a
light
snowfall
and
that
will
be
an
experience
for
you
surely
you
can
trust
me
not
to
run
any
real
risk
oh
yes
i
do
indeed
but
i
have
read
of
people
being
caught
in
these
storms
and
suffering
terribly
not
on
the
forno
i
assure
you
i
do
wish
to
minimize
the
perils
of
your
first
ascent
but
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
this
is
an
exhibition
glacier
if
it
was
nearer
town
you
would
find
an
orchestra
in
each
amphitheater
up
there
with
sideshows
in
every
couloir
jesting
apart
you
are
absolutely
safe
with
barth
and
me
not
to
mention
the
irrepressible
gentleman
who
carries
our
provisions
helen
was
fully
alive
to
the
fact
that
a
woman
who
joins
a
mountaineering
party
should
not
impose
her
personal
doubts
on
men
who
are
willing
to
go
on
she
flourished
her
ice
ax
bravely
and
cried
excelsior
in
the
next
instant
she
regretted
her
choice
of
expression
the
moral
of
longfellow
poem
might
be
admirable
but
the
fate
of
its
hero
was
unpleasantly
topical
again
bower
laughed
ah
he
said
will
you
deny
now
that
i
am
a
first
rate
receiver
of
wireless
messages
she
had
no
breath
left
for
a
quip
barth
was
hurrying
and
the
thin
air
was
beginning
to
have
its
effect
when
an
unusually
smooth
stretch
of
ice
permitted
her
to
take
her
eyes
from
the
track
for
a
moment
she
looked
back
to
learn
the
cause
of
such
haste
to
her
complete
astonishment
the
maloja
pass
and
the
hills
beyond
it
were
dissolved
in
a
thick
mist
a
monstrous
cloud
was
sweeping
up
the
orlegna
valley
as
yet
it
was
making
for
the
muretto
pass
rather
than
the
actual
ravine
of
the
forno
but
a
few
wraiths
of
vapor
were
sailing
high
overhead
and
it
needed
no
weatherwise
native
to
predict
that
ere
long
the
glacier
itself
would
be
covered
by
that
white
pall
she
glanced
at
bower
he
smiled
cheerfully
it
is
nothing
he
murmured
i
really
do
care
she
said
one
does
not
shirk
an
adventure
merely
because
it
is
disagreeable
the
pity
is
that
all
this
lovely
sunshine
must
vanish
it
will
reappear
you
will
be
charmed
with
the
novelty
in
an
hour
or
less
is
it
far
to
the
hut
hardly
twenty
minutes
at
our
present
pace
a
growl
from
barth
stopped
their
brief
talk
another
huge
crevasse
yawned
in
front
there
was
an
ice
bridge
with
snow
like
others
they
had
crossed
but
this
was
a
slender
structure
and
the
leader
stabbed
it
viciously
with
the
butt
of
his
ax
before
he
ventured
on
it
the
others
kept
the
rope
taut
and
he
crossed
safely
they
followed
as
helen
gained
the
further
side
she
heard
bower
chuckle
another
thrill
i
am
growing
quite
used
to
them
she
said
well
it
may
help
somewhat
if
i
tell
you
that
the
temporary
departure
of
the
sun
will
cause
this
particular
bridge
to
be
ten
times
as
strong
when
we
return
attention
cried
barth
taking
a
sharp
turn
to
the
left
the
meaning
of
his
warning
was
soon
apparent
they
had
to
descend
a
few
feet
of
rough
ice
and
helen
found
to
her
great
relief
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
were
approaching
the
lateral
moraine
already
the
sky
was
overcast
the
glacier
had
taken
to
itself
a
cold
grayness
that
was
disconcerting
the
heavy
mist
fell
on
them
with
inconceivable
rapidity
shining
peaks
and
towering
precipices
of
naked
rock
were
swept
out
of
sight
each
instant
the
weather
had
changed
with
a
magical
speed
the
mist
advanced
with
the
rush
of
an
express
train
and
a
strong
wind
sprang
up
as
though
it
had
burst
through
a
restraining
wall
and
was
bent
on
overwhelming
the
daring
mortals
who
were
penetrating
its
chosen
territory
somehow
anyhow
helen
scrambled
on
she
was
obliged
to
keep
eyes
and
mind
intent
on
each
step
her
chief
object
was
to
imitate
barth
to
poise
and
jump
and
clamber
with
feet
and
hands
exactly
as
he
did
at
this
stage
the
rope
was
obviously
a
hindrance
but
none
of
the
men
suggested
its
removal
and
helen
had
enough
to
occupy
her
wits
without
troubling
them
by
a
question
even
in
the
stress
of
her
own
breathless
exertions
she
had
room
in
her
mind
for
a
wondering
pity
for
the
heavily
laden
karl
she
marveled
that
anyone
be
he
strong
as
samson
could
carry
such
a
load
and
not
fall
under
it
yet
he
was
lumbering
along
behind
bower
with
a
clumsy
agility
that
was
almost
supernatural
to
her
thinking
she
was
still
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
most
of
her
own
struggles
were
due
more
to
the
rarefied
air
than
to
the
real
difficulties
of
the
route
at
last
when
she
really
thought
she
must
cry
out
for
a
rest
when
a
steeper
climb
than
any
hitherto
encountered
had
bereft
her
almost
of
the
power
to
take
another
upward
spring
to
the
ledge
of
some
enormous
boulder
when
her
knees
and
ankles
were
sore
and
bruised
and
the
skin
of
her
fingers
was
beginning
to
fray
under
her
stout
gloves
she
found
herself
standing
on
a
comparatively
level
space
formed
of
broken
stones
a
rough
wall
surmounted
by
a
flat
pitched
roof
stared
at
her
out
of
the
mist
in
the
center
of
the
wall
a
small
square
shuttered
window
suggested
a
habitation
her
head
swam
and
her
eyes
ached
dreadfully
but
she
knew
that
this
was
the
hut
and
strove
desperately
to
appear
self
possessed
accept
my
congratulations
miss
wynton
said
a
low
voice
at
her
ear
not
one
woman
in
a
thousand
would
have
gone
through
that
last
without
a
murmur
you
are
no
longer
a
novice
allow
me
to
present
you
with
the
freedom
of
the
alps
this
is
one
of
the
many
châteaux
at
your
disposal
a
wild
swirl
of
sleet
lashed
them
venomously
this
first
whip
of
the
gale
seemed
to
have
the
spitefulness
of
disappointed
rage
helen
felt
her
arm
grasped
bower
led
her
to
a
doorway
cunningly
disposed
out
of
the
path
of
the
dreaded
southwest
wind
at
that
instant
all
the
woman
in
her
recognized
that
the
man
was
big
and
strong
and
self
reliant
and
that
it
was
good
to
have
him
near
shouting
reassuring
words
that
were
whirled
across
the
glacier
by
the
violence
of
the
tempest
chapter
ix
etta
father
though
the
hut
was
a
crude
thing
a
triumph
of
essentials
over
luxuries
helen
had
never
before
hailed
four
walls
and
a
roof
with
such
heartfelt
if
silent
thanksgiving
she
sank
exhausted
on
a
rough
bench
and
watched
the
engadiners
unpacking
the
stores
and
firewood
carried
in
their
rucksacks
their
businesslike
air
supplied
the
tonic
she
needed
though
the
howling
storm
seemed
to
threaten
the
tiny
refuge
with
destruction
these
two
men
set
to
work
coolly
and
methodically
to
prepare
a
meal
barth
arranged
the
contents
of
karl
bulky
package
on
a
small
table
and
the
porter
busied
himself
with
lighting
a
fire
in
a
swiss
stove
that
stood
in
the
center
of
the
outer
room
an
inner
apartment
loomed
black
and
uninviting
through
an
open
doorway
helen
discovered
later
that
some
scanty
accommodation
was
provided
there
for
those
who
meant
to
sleep
in
the
hut
in
readiness
for
an
early
ascent
while
it
supplied
a
separate
room
in
the
event
of
women
taking
part
in
an
expedition
bower
offered
her
a
quantity
of
brandy
and
water
she
declined
it
declaring
that
she
needed
only
time
to
regain
her
breath
he
was
a
man
who
might
be
trusted
not
to
pester
anyone
with
well
meant
but
useless
attentions
he
went
to
the
door
lit
a
cigarette
and
seemed
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
sleet
as
it
pelted
the
moraine
or
gathered
in
drifts
in
the
minor
fissures
of
the
glacier
within
a
remarkably
short
space
of
time
karl
had
concocted
two
cups
of
steaming
coffee
helen
was
then
all
aglow
her
strength
was
restored
the
boisterous
wind
had
crimsoned
her
cheeks
beneath
the
tan
she
had
never
looked
such
a
picture
of
radiant
womanhood
as
after
this
tussle
with
the
storm
luckily
her
clothing
was
not
wet
since
the
travelers
reached
the
at
the
very
instant
the
elements
became
really
aggressive
it
was
a
quite
composed
and
reinvigorated
helen
who
summoned
bower
from
his
contemplation
of
the
weather
portents
we
may
be
besieged
she
cried
but
at
any
rate
we
are
not
on
famine
rations
what
a
spread
you
could
hardly
have
brought
more
food
if
you
fancied
we
might
be
kept
here
a
week
the
sustained
physical
effort
called
for
during
the
last
part
of
the
climb
seemed
to
have
dispelled
his
fit
of
abstraction
being
an
eminently
adaptable
man
he
responded
to
her
mood
ah
that
sounds
more
like
the
enthusiast
who
set
forth
so
gayly
from
the
kursaal
this
morning
he
answered
pulling
the
door
ajar
before
he
took
a
seat
by
her
side
on
the
bench
a
few
minutes
ago
you
were
ready
to
condemn
me
as
several
kinds
of
idiot
for
going
on
in
the
teeth
of
our
warnings
now
confess
i
do
think
i
could
have
climbed
another
ten
yards
she
admitted
our
haste
was
due
to
barth
anxiety
he
wanted
to
save
you
from
a
drenching
it
was
a
near
thing
and
with
the
thermometer
falling
a
degree
a
minute
soaked
garments
might
have
brought
very
unpleasant
consequences
but
that
was
our
only
risk
old
mountaineer
as
i
am
i
hardly
expected
such
a
blizzard
in
august
after
such
short
notice
too
otherwise
now
that
we
are
safely
housed
you
are
fortunate
in
securing
a
memorable
experience
the
storm
will
soon
blow
over
but
it
promises
to
be
lively
while
it
lasts
helen
was
sipping
her
coffee
perhaps
her
eyes
conveyed
the
question
her
tongue
hesitated
to
utter
bower
smiled
pleasantly
and
gesticulated
with
hands
and
shoulders
in
a
way
that
was
foreign
to
his
studiously
cultivated
english
habit
of
repose
indeed
with
his
climber
garb
he
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
new
manner
there
was
a
perplexing
change
in
him
since
the
morning
yes
he
said
i
understand
perfectly
you
and
i
might
sing
ohne
miss
wynton
i
have
known
these
summer
gales
to
last
four
days
but
pray
do
not
be
alarmed
for
helen
nearly
dropped
her
cup
in
quick
dismay
my
own
opinion
is
that
we
shall
have
a
delightful
afternoon
of
course
i
am
a
discredited
prophet
ask
barth
the
guide
hearing
his
name
mentioned
glanced
at
them
though
he
was
engaged
at
the
moment
in
taking
the
wrappings
off
a
quantity
of
bread
cold
chicken
and
slices
of
ham
and
beef
he
agreed
with
bower
the
barometer
stood
high
when
they
left
the
hotel
he
thought
as
all
men
think
who
live
in
the
open
that
the
sharper
the
blast
the
sooner
it
past
moreover
broke
in
karl
who
refused
to
be
left
out
of
the
conversation
johann
klucker
cat
was
sitting
with
its
back
to
the
stove
last
evening
this
bit
of
homely
philosophy
brought
a
ripple
of
laughter
from
helen
whereupon
karl
explained
cats
are
very
wise
johann
klucker
cat
is
old
therefore
she
is
skilled
in
reading
the
tokens
of
the
weather
a
cat
hates
wind
and
rain
and
makes
her
arrangements
accordingly
if
she
washes
herself
smoothly
the
next
twelve
hours
will
be
fine
if
she
licks
against
the
grain
it
will
be
wet
when
she
lies
with
her
back
to
the
fire
there
will
surely
be
a
squall
when
her
tail
is
up
and
her
coat
rises
look
out
for
wind
johann
klucker
cat
has
settled
the
dispute
said
bower
gravely
in
english
a
squall
it
is
a
most
suitable
prediction
for
a
cat
and
i
am
once
more
rehabilitated
in
your
esteem
i
hope
a
cold
iridescence
suddenly
illumined
the
gloomy
interior
of
the
hut
it
gave
individuality
to
each
particle
of
sleet
whirling
past
the
door
helen
thought
that
the
sun
had
broken
through
the
storm
clouds
for
an
instant
but
bower
said
quietly
are
you
afraid
of
lightning
not
very
i
do
like
it
some
people
collapse
altogether
when
they
see
it
perhaps
when
forewarned
you
are
forearmed
a
low
rumble
boomed
up
the
valley
and
the
mountain
echoes
muttered
in
solemn
chorus
we
are
to
be
spared
none
of
the
scenic
accessories
then
said
helen
none
in
fact
you
will
soon
see
and
hear
a
thunder
storm
that
would
have
delighted
gustave
doré
please
remember
that
it
can
not
last
long
and
that
this
hut
has
been
built
twenty
years
to
my
knowledge
helen
sipped
her
coffee
but
pushed
away
a
plate
set
before
her
by
barth
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
the
door
wide
open
she
said
you
prefer
to
lunch
later
yes
and
you
wish
to
face
the
music
is
that
it
i
think
so
let
me
remind
you
that
jove
thunderbolts
are
really
forged
on
the
hilltops
i
am
here
so
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
shall
not
scream
or
faint
if
that
is
what
you
dread
i
dread
nothing
but
your
anger
for
not
having
turned
back
when
a
retreat
was
possible
i
hate
turning
back
miss
wynton
i
have
never
yet
withdrawn
from
any
enterprise
seriously
undertaken
and
i
was
determined
to
share
your
first
ramble
among
my
beloved
hills
another
gleam
of
light
bluer
and
more
penetrating
than
its
forerunner
lit
the
brown
rafters
of
the
it
was
succeeded
by
a
crash
like
the
roar
of
massed
artillery
the
walls
trembled
some
particles
of
mortar
rattled
noisily
to
the
floor
a
strange
sound
of
rending
followed
by
a
heavy
thud
suggested
something
more
tangible
than
thunderbolts
bower
kicked
the
door
and
it
swung
inward
an
avalanche
he
said
probably
a
rockfall
too
of
course
the
hut
stands
clear
of
the
track
of
unpleasant
visitors
of
that
description
helen
had
not
expected
this
courageous
bearing
in
a
man
of
physical
characteristics
hitherto
she
had
regarded
him
as
somewhat
self
indulgent
a
sybarite
the
product
of
modernity
in
its
london
aspects
his
demeanor
in
the
train
in
the
hotel
bespoke
one
accustomed
to
gratify
the
flesh
who
found
all
the
world
ready
to
pander
to
his
desires
again
she
was
conscious
of
that
instinctive
trustfulness
a
woman
freely
reposes
in
a
dominant
man
oddly
enough
she
thought
of
spencer
in
the
same
breath
an
hour
earlier
had
she
been
asked
which
of
these
two
would
command
her
confidence
during
a
storm
her
unhesitating
choice
would
have
favored
the
american
now
she
was
at
least
sure
that
bower
coolness
was
not
assumed
his
attitude
inspired
emulation
she
rose
and
went
to
the
door
i
want
to
see
an
avalanche
she
cried
where
did
that
one
fall
bower
followed
her
he
spoke
over
her
shoulder
on
monte
roseg
i
expect
the
weather
seems
to
be
clearing
slightly
this
tearing
wind
will
soon
roll
up
the
mist
and
the
thunder
will
certainly
start
another
big
rock
or
a
snowslide
if
you
are
lucky
you
may
witness
something
really
fine
a
dazzling
flash
leaped
over
the
glacier
although
the
surrounding
peaks
were
as
yet
invisible
through
the
haze
of
sleet
and
vapor
objects
near
at
hand
were
revealed
with
uncanny
distinctness
each
frozen
wave
on
the
surface
of
the
ice
was
etched
in
sharp
lines
a
cluster
of
séracs
on
a
neighboring
icefall
showed
all
their
mad
chaos
the
blue
green
chasm
of
a
huge
crevasse
was
illumined
to
a
depth
far
below
any
point
to
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
penetrated
on
the
neighboring
slope
of
monte
roseg
the
crimson
and
green
and
yellow
mosses
were
given
sudden
life
against
the
black
background
of
rock
every
boulder
here
wore
a
somber
robe
they
were
stark
and
grim
the
eye
instantly
caught
the
contrast
to
their
fellows
piled
on
the
lower
moraine
or
in
the
bed
of
the
orlegna
helen
was
quick
to
note
the
new
tone
of
black
amid
the
vividly
white
patches
of
snow
she
waited
until
the
deafening
thunder
peal
was
dying
away
in
eerie
cadences
why
are
the
rocks
black
here
and
almost
white
in
the
valley
she
asked
because
they
are
young
as
rocks
go
was
the
smiling
answer
they
have
yet
to
pass
through
the
mill
they
will
be
battered
and
bruised
and
polished
before
they
emerge
from
the
glacier
several
years
hence
and
a
few
miles
nearer
peace
in
that
they
resemble
men
my
word
miss
wynton
you
have
caused
me
to
evolve
a
rather
poetic
explanation
of
certain
gray
hairs
i
have
noticed
of
late
among
my
own
raven
locks
you
appear
to
know
and
love
these
hills
so
well
that
i
wonder
if
you
will
excuse
a
personal
remark
i
wonder
you
ever
were
able
to
tear
yourself
away
from
them
i
have
missed
too
much
of
real
enjoyment
in
the
effort
to
amass
riches
he
said
slowly
believe
me
that
thought
has
held
me
since
since
you
and
i
set
foot
on
the
forno
together
but
you
knew
you
were
no
stranger
to
the
alps
i
am
beginning
to
understand
that
one
can
not
claim
kinship
with
the
high
places
until
they
stir
the
heart
more
in
storm
than
in
sunshine
when
i
saw
all
these
giants
glittering
in
the
sun
like
knights
in
silver
armor
i
described
them
to
myself
as
gloriously
beautiful
now
i
feel
that
they
are
more
than
that
they
are
awful
pitiless
in
their
indifference
to
frail
mortals
they
carry
me
into
a
dim
region
where
life
and
death
are
terms
without
meaning
yes
that
is
the
true
spirit
of
the
mountains
i
too
used
to
look
on
them
with
affectionate
reverence
and
you
recall
the
old
days
perhaps
if
i
am
deemed
worthy
you
will
teach
me
the
cult
once
more
he
bent
closer
helen
became
conscious
that
in
her
enthusiasm
she
had
spoken
unguardedly
she
moved
away
slightly
but
unmistakably
a
step
or
two
out
into
the
open
for
the
hut
on
that
side
was
not
exposed
to
the
bitter
violence
of
the
wind
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
us
in
a
change
of
rôle
she
cried
i
should
play
the
poorest
travesty
of
mentor
to
your
telemachus
oh
what
is
that
while
she
was
speaking
another
blinding
flare
of
lightning
flooded
moraine
and
glacier
and
pierced
the
veil
of
sleet
her
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shriek
bower
sprang
forward
his
left
hand
rested
reassuringly
across
her
shoulders
better
come
inside
the
hut
he
began
but
i
saw
someone
a
white
face
staring
at
me
down
there
it
is
possible
there
is
no
cause
for
fear
a
party
may
have
crossed
from
italy
there
would
be
none
from
the
maloja
at
this
hour
helen
was
actually
trembling
bower
drew
her
a
little
nearer
he
himself
was
unnerved
a
prey
to
wilder
emotions
than
she
could
guess
till
later
days
brought
a
fuller
understanding
it
was
a
mad
trick
of
fate
that
threw
the
girl
into
his
embrace
just
then
for
another
sheet
of
fire
revealed
to
her
terrified
vision
the
figures
of
spencer
and
stampa
on
the
rocks
beneath
with
brutal
candor
the
same
flash
showed
her
nestling
close
to
bower
for
some
reason
she
shuddered
though
the
merciful
gloom
of
the
next
few
seconds
restored
her
faculties
her
face
and
neck
were
aflame
she
almost
felt
that
she
had
been
detected
in
some
fault
her
confusion
was
not
lessened
by
hearing
a
muttered
curse
from
her
companion
careless
of
the
stinging
sleet
she
leaped
down
to
a
broad
tier
of
rock
below
the
plateau
of
the
hut
and
cried
shrilly
is
that
really
you
mr
spencer
a
more
tremendous
burst
of
thunder
than
any
yet
experienced
dwarfed
all
other
sounds
for
an
appreciable
time
the
american
scrambled
up
almost
at
her
feet
and
stood
beside
her
stampa
came
quick
on
his
heels
moving
with
a
lightness
and
accuracy
of
foothold
amazing
in
one
so
lame
just
me
miss
wynton
sorry
if
i
have
frightened
you
but
our
old
friend
here
was
insistent
that
we
should
hurry
i
have
been
tracking
you
since
nine
spencer
words
were
nonchalantly
polite
he
even
raised
his
cap
though
the
fury
of
the
ice
laden
blast
might
well
have
excused
this
formal
act
of
courtesy
helen
was
still
blushing
so
painfully
that
she
became
angry
with
herself
and
her
voice
was
hardly
under
control
nevertheless
she
managed
to
say
how
kind
and
thoughtful
of
you
i
am
all
right
as
you
see
bower
and
the
guide
were
able
to
bring
me
here
before
the
storm
broke
we
happened
to
be
standing
near
the
door
watching
the
lightning
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
i
was
so
stupidly
startled
that
i
screamed
and
almost
fell
into
bower
arms
put
in
that
way
it
did
not
sound
so
distressing
and
spencer
had
no
desire
to
add
further
difficulties
to
a
situation
already
awkward
guess
you
scared
me
too
he
said
i
suppose
now
we
are
at
the
hut
stampa
will
not
object
to
my
waiting
five
minutes
or
so
before
we
start
for
home
surely
you
will
lunch
with
us
everything
is
set
out
on
the
table
and
we
have
food
enough
for
a
regiment
you
would
need
it
if
you
remained
here
another
couple
of
hours
miss
wynton
stampa
tells
me
that
a
first
rate
which
is
swiss
for
a
blizzard
i
believe
is
blowing
up
this
thunder
storm
is
the
preliminary
to
a
heavy
downfall
of
snow
that
is
why
i
came
if
we
are
not
off
the
glacier
before
two
it
will
become
impassable
till
a
lot
of
the
snow
melts
what
is
that
you
are
saying
demanded
bower
bruskly
helen
and
the
two
men
had
reached
the
level
of
the
but
stampa
thinking
they
would
all
enter
kept
in
the
rear
if
that
fairy
tale
accounts
for
your
errand
you
are
on
a
wild
goose
chase
mr
spencer
he
had
not
heard
the
american
words
clearly
but
he
gathered
sufficient
to
account
for
the
younger
man
motive
in
following
them
and
was
furiously
annoyed
by
this
unlooked
for
interruption
he
had
no
syllable
of
thanks
for
a
friendly
action
though
no
small
risk
attended
the
crossing
of
the
forno
during
a
gale
it
was
evident
he
strongly
resented
the
presence
of
both
spencer
and
the
guide
helen
after
her
first
eager
outburst
was
tongue
tied
she
saw
that
her
rescuers
were
dripping
wet
and
was
amazed
that
bower
should
greet
them
so
curtly
though
to
be
sure
she
believed
implicitly
that
the
storm
would
soon
pass
stampa
was
already
inside
the
hut
he
was
haranguing
barth
and
the
porter
vehemently
and
they
were
listening
with
a
curious
submissiveness
spencer
was
the
most
collected
person
present
he
brushed
aside
bower
acrimony
as
lightly
as
he
had
accepted
helen
embarrassed
explanation
this
is
not
my
hustle
at
all
he
said
stampa
heard
that
his
adored
stampa
is
that
stampa
bower
strident
voice
was
hushed
to
a
hoarse
murmur
it
reminded
one
of
his
hearers
of
a
growling
dog
suddenly
cowed
by
fear
helen
ears
were
tuned
to
this
perplexing
note
but
spencer
interpreted
it
according
to
his
dislike
of
the
man
stampa
heard
he
went
on
with
precision
that
miss
wynton
had
gone
to
the
forno
he
is
by
far
the
most
experienced
guide
to
be
found
on
this
side
of
the
alps
and
he
believes
that
anyone
remaining
up
here
will
surely
be
imprisoned
in
the
hut
a
week
or
more
by
bad
weather
in
fact
even
now
an
hour
may
make
all
the
difference
between
danger
and
safety
perhaps
you
can
convince
him
he
is
wrong
i
know
nothing
about
it
beyond
the
evidence
of
my
senses
backed
up
by
some
acquaintance
with
blizzards
anyhow
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
miss
wynton
will
be
wise
if
she
listens
to
the
points
of
the
argument
in
the
hotel
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
return
at
once
said
helen
timidly
her
sensitive
nature
warned
her
that
these
two
men
were
ready
to
quarrel
and
that
she
herself
in
some
nebulous
way
was
the
cause
of
their
mutual
enmity
beyond
this
her
intuition
could
not
travel
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
realize
how
sorely
her
wish
to
placate
bower
disquieted
spencer
he
had
seen
the
two
under
conditions
that
might
indeed
be
explicable
by
helen
fright
but
he
would
extend
no
such
charitable
consideration
to
bower
whose
conduct
no
matter
how
it
was
viewed
made
him
a
rival
yes
it
had
come
to
that
spencer
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
to
stampa
during
the
toilsome
journey
from
maloja
he
had
looked
facts
stubbornly
in
the
face
and
the
looking
served
to
clear
certain
doubts
from
his
heart
and
brain
he
wanted
to
woo
and
win
helen
for
his
wife
he
was
enmeshed
in
a
net
of
his
own
contriving
and
its
strands
were
too
strong
to
be
broken
if
helen
was
reft
from
him
now
he
would
gaze
on
a
darkened
world
for
many
a
day
but
he
was
endowed
with
a
splendid
self
control
that
element
of
cast
steel
in
his
composition
discovered
by
dunston
after
five
acquaintance
kept
him
rigid
under
the
strain
sorry
i
should
figure
as
spoiling
your
excursion
miss
wynton
he
was
able
to
say
calmly
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
weather
is
bad
and
you
will
have
plenty
of
fine
days
later
bower
crept
nearer
his
action
suggested
stealth
although
the
wind
was
howling
under
the
deep
eaves
of
the
hut
he
almost
whispered
yes
you
are
right
quite
right
let
us
go
now
at
once
with
you
and
me
spencer
miss
wynton
will
be
safe
safer
than
with
the
guides
they
can
follow
with
the
stores
come
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
the
others
were
so
taken
aback
by
his
astounding
change
of
front
that
they
were
silent
for
an
instant
it
was
helen
who
protested
firmly
enough
the
lightning
seems
to
have
given
us
an
attack
of
nerves
she
said
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
rush
off
in
that
manner
but
there
is
peril
real
peril
in
delay
i
admit
it
i
was
wrong
bower
anxiety
was
only
too
evident
spencer
regarding
him
from
a
single
viewpoint
deemed
him
a
coward
and
his
gorge
rose
at
the
thought
oh
nonsense
he
cried
contemptuously
we
shall
be
two
hours
on
the
glacier
so
five
more
minutes
wo
cut
any
ice
if
you
have
food
and
drink
in
there
stampa
certainly
wants
both
we
all
need
them
we
have
to
meet
that
gale
all
the
way
the
two
hours
may
become
three
before
we
reach
the
path
helen
guessed
the
reason
of
his
disdain
it
was
unjust
but
the
moment
did
not
permit
of
a
hint
that
he
was
mistaken
to
save
bower
from
further
commitment
which
she
was
convinced
was
due
entirely
to
regard
for
her
own
safety
she
went
into
the
hut
stampa
she
said
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
taking
so
much
trouble
i
suppose
we
may
eat
something
before
we
start
assuredly
he
cried
am
i
not
here
were
it
to
begin
to
snow
at
once
i
could
still
bring
you
unharmed
to
the
chalets
josef
barth
had
borne
stampa
reproaches
with
surly
deference
but
he
refused
to
be
degraded
in
this
fashion
before
karl
too
whose
tongue
wagged
so
loosely
that
is
the
talk
of
a
foolish
boy
not
of
a
man
he
cried
wrathfully
am
i
not
fitted
then
to
take
mademoiselle
home
after
bringing
her
here
truly
on
a
fine
day
josef
was
the
smiling
answer
i
told
monsieur
that
a
was
blowing
up
from
the
south
so
did
karl
but
he
would
not
hearken
foi
i
am
not
to
blame
barth
on
his
dignity
introduced
a
few
words
of
french
picked
up
from
the
chamounix
men
he
fancied
they
would
awe
stampa
and
prove
incidentally
how
wide
was
his
own
experience
the
old
guide
only
laughed
a
nice
pair
you
and
karl
he
shouted
are
the
voyageurs
in
your
care
or
not
you
told
monsieur
indeed
you
ought
to
have
refused
to
take
mademoiselle
that
would
have
settled
the
affair
i
fancy
but
this
monsieur
knows
as
much
about
the
mountains
as
any
of
us
he
might
surprise
even
you
stampa
he
has
climbed
the
matterhorn
from
zermatt
and
breuil
he
has
come
down
the
rock
wall
on
the
col
des
nantillons
how
is
one
to
argue
with
such
a
on
this
glacier
stampa
whistled
oh
knows
the
matterhorn
does
he
what
is
his
name
bower
said
helen
mark
bower
what
say
that
again
mark
bower
is
that
your
english
way
of
putting
it
helen
attributed
stampa
low
hiss
to
a
tardy
recognition
of
fame
as
a
mountaineer
though
the
hour
was
noon
the
light
was
feeble
veritable
thunder
clouds
had
gathered
above
the
mist
and
the
expression
of
stampa
face
was
almost
hidden
in
the
obscurity
of
the
hut
that
is
his
name
she
repeated
you
must
have
heard
of
him
he
was
well
known
on
the
high
alps
years
ago
she
paused
before
she
added
those
concluding
words
she
was
about
to
say
in
your
time
but
the
substituted
phrase
was
less
personal
since
the
circumstances
under
which
stampa
ceased
to
be
a
notability
in
the
street
at
zermatt
were
in
her
mind
god
in
heaven
muttered
the
old
man
passing
a
hand
over
his
face
as
though
waking
from
a
dream
god
in
heaven
can
it
be
that
my
prayer
is
answered
at
last
he
shambled
out
spencer
had
waited
to
watch
the
almost
continuous
blaze
of
lightning
playing
on
the
glacier
distant
summits
were
now
looming
through
the
diminishing
downpour
of
sleet
he
was
wondering
if
by
any
chance
stampa
might
be
mistaken
bower
stood
somewhat
apart
seemingly
engaged
in
the
same
engrossing
task
the
wind
was
not
quite
so
fierce
as
during
its
first
onset
it
blew
in
gusts
no
longer
screaming
in
a
shrill
and
sustained
note
it
wailed
fitfully
stampa
lurched
unevenly
close
to
bower
he
was
about
to
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
but
he
appeared
to
recollect
himself
in
time
marcus
bauer
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
terrible
by
reason
of
its
restraint
bower
wheeled
suddenly
he
did
not
flinch
his
manner
suggested
a
certain
preparedness
thus
might
a
strong
man
face
a
wild
beast
when
hope
lay
only
in
the
matching
of
sinew
against
sinew
that
is
not
my
name
he
snarled
viciously
marcus
bauer
repeated
stampa
in
the
same
repressed
monotone
i
am
etta
father
why
do
you
address
me
in
that
fashion
i
have
never
before
seen
you
no
you
took
care
of
that
you
feared
etta
father
though
you
cared
little
for
christian
stampa
the
guide
but
i
have
seen
you
marcus
bauer
you
were
slim
then
an
elegant
is
it
not
and
many
a
time
have
i
hobbled
into
the
hotel
mont
cervin
to
look
at
your
portrait
in
a
group
lest
i
should
forget
your
face
yet
i
passed
you
just
now
great
god
i
passed
you
a
ferocity
glared
from
bower
eyes
that
might
well
have
daunted
stampa
for
an
instant
he
glanced
toward
spencer
whose
clear
cut
profile
was
silhouetted
against
a
background
of
ice
now
gleaming
in
a
constant
flutter
of
lightning
stampa
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
true
cause
of
bower
frenzy
he
thought
that
terror
was
spurring
him
to
self
defense
an
insane
impulse
to
kill
to
fight
with
the
nails
and
teeth
almost
mastered
him
but
that
must
not
be
yet
it
is
useless
marcus
bauer
he
said
with
a
calmness
so
horribly
unreal
that
its
deadly
intent
was
all
the
more
manifest
i
am
the
avenger
not
you
i
can
tear
you
to
pieces
with
my
hands
when
i
will
it
would
be
here
and
now
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
the
english
who
saved
me
from
death
it
is
not
meet
that
she
should
witness
your
expiation
that
is
to
be
settled
between
you
and
me
alone
bower
made
one
last
effort
to
assert
himself
you
are
talking
in
riddles
man
he
said
if
you
believe
you
have
some
long
forgotten
grievance
against
one
of
my
name
come
and
see
me
at
the
hotel
perhaps
yes
i
shall
see
you
do
not
dream
that
you
can
escape
me
now
that
i
know
you
live
i
would
search
the
wide
world
for
you
blessed
mother
how
you
must
have
feared
me
all
these
years
stampa
was
using
the
romansch
dialect
of
the
italian
alps
bower
spoke
in
german
spencer
heard
them
indistinctly
he
marveled
that
they
should
discuss
as
he
imagined
the
state
of
the
weather
with
such
subdued
passion
hello
christian
he
cried
the
clouds
are
lifting
somewhat
where
is
your
promised
snow
stampa
peered
up
into
bower
face
for
his
twisted
leg
had
reduced
his
own
unusual
height
by
many
inches
he
whispered
at
ten
outside
the
hotel
then
we
have
a
settlement
is
it
so
there
was
no
answer
bower
was
wrestling
with
a
mad
desire
to
grapple
with
him
and
fling
him
down
among
the
black
rocks
stampa
crept
nearer
a
ghastly
smile
lit
his
rugged
features
and
his
clattered
to
the
broken
shingle
at
his
feet
i
offer
you
he
said
i
am
in
no
hurry
have
i
not
waited
sixteen
years
but
it
may
be
that
you
are
tortured
by
a
devil
marcus
bauer
shall
it
be
now
the
peasant
believed
that
the
millionaire
had
a
conscience
not
yet
did
he
understand
that
balked
desire
is
stronger
than
any
conscience
it
really
seemed
that
nothing
could
withhold
these
two
from
mortal
struggle
then
and
there
spencer
was
regarding
them
curiously
but
they
paid
no
heed
to
him
bower
tongue
was
darting
in
and
out
between
his
teeth
the
red
blood
surged
to
his
temples
stampa
was
still
smiling
his
lips
moved
in
the
strangest
prayer
that
ever
came
from
a
man
heart
he
was
actually
thanking
the
madonna
mother
of
the
great
peacemaker
for
having
brought
his
enemy
within
reach
mr
bower
came
helen
voice
from
the
door
of
the
why
do
you
join
us
and
you
spencer
stampa
come
here
and
eat
at
once
at
ten
or
now
the
old
man
whispered
again
curse
you
stampa
twisted
himself
round
i
am
not
hungry
he
cried
i
ate
chocolate
all
the
way
up
the
glacier
but
do
you
be
speedy
we
have
lost
too
much
time
already
bower
brushed
past
and
the
guide
stooped
to
recover
his
ice
ax
spencer
though
troubled
sufficiently
by
his
own
disturbing
fantasies
did
not
fail
to
notice
their
peculiar
behavior
but
he
answered
helen
with
a
pleasant
disclaimer
christian
kept
his
hoard
a
secret
miss
wynton
i
too
have
lost
my
appetite
said
he
once
we
start
we
shall
hardly
be
able
to
unpack
the
hamper
again
said
helen
the
american
was
trying
her
temper
she
suspected
that
he
carried
his
hostility
to
the
absurd
pitch
of
refusing
to
partake
of
any
food
provided
by
bower
it
was
a
queer
coincidence
that
spencer
harbored
the
same
notion
with
regard
to
stampa
and
wondered
at
it
i
shall
starve
willingly
he
said
it
will
be
a
just
punishment
for
declining
the
good
things
that
did
not
tempt
me
when
they
were
available
bower
poured
out
a
quantity
of
wine
and
drank
it
at
a
gulp
he
refilled
the
glass
and
nearly
emptied
it
a
second
time
but
he
touched
not
a
morsel
of
meat
or
bread
helen
fortunately
attributed
the
conduct
of
the
men
to
spleen
she
ate
a
sandwich
and
found
that
she
was
far
more
ready
for
a
meal
than
she
had
imagined
stampa
broad
frame
darkened
the
doorway
he
told
karl
not
to
burden
himself
with
anything
save
the
cutlery
now
that
he
was
the
skilled
guide
again
the
leader
in
whom
they
trusted
his
worn
face
was
animated
and
his
voice
eager
helen
heard
spencer
exclamation
without
by
jove
stampa
you
are
right
here
comes
the
snow
quick
quick
cried
stampa
barth
you
lead
stop
at
my
call
karl
next
then
the
and
my
monsieur
yours
follows
and
i
come
last
no
no
burst
out
bower
lowering
a
third
glass
of
wine
from
his
lips
diavolo
it
shall
be
as
i
have
said
shouted
stampa
with
an
imperious
gesture
helen
remarked
it
but
things
were
being
done
and
said
that
were
inexplicable
even
bower
was
silenced
are
we
to
be
roped
then
growled
barth
have
you
never
crossed
ice
during
a
snow
storm
asked
stampa
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
ready
the
lightning
flashes
were
less
frequent
and
the
thunder
was
muttering
far
away
amid
the
secret
places
of
the
bernina
the
wind
was
rising
again
instead
of
sleet
it
carried
snowflakes
and
these
did
not
sting
the
face
nor
patter
on
the
ice
but
they
clung
everywhere
and
the
sable
rocks
were
taking
unto
themselves
a
new
garment
rang
out
stampa
trumpet
like
call
and
barth
leaped
down
into
the
moraine
chapter
x
on
the
glacier
barth
a
good
man
on
ice
and
rock
was
not
a
genius
among
guides
faced
by
an
apparently
unscalable
rock
wall
or
lost
in
a
wilderness
of
séracs
he
would
never
guess
the
one
way
that
led
to
success
but
he
was
skilled
in
the
technic
of
his
profession
and
did
not
make
the
mistake
now
of
subjecting
helen
or
spencer
to
the
risk
of
an
ugly
fall
the
air
temperature
had
dropped
from
eighty
degrees
fahrenheit
to
below
freezing
point
rocks
that
gave
safe
foothold
an
hour
earlier
were
now
glazed
with
an
amalgam
of
sleet
and
snow
if
in
his
dull
mind
he
wondered
why
spencer
came
next
to
helen
rather
than
bower
or
stampa
either
of
whom
would
know
exactly
when
to
give
that
timely
aid
with
the
rope
that
imparts
such
confidence
to
the
novice
he
said
nothing
stampa
eye
was
on
him
his
pride
was
up
in
arms
it
behooved
him
to
press
on
at
just
the
right
pace
and
commit
no
blunder
helen
who
had
been
glad
to
get
back
to
the
moraine
during
the
ascent
was
ready
to
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
felt
her
feet
on
the
ice
again
those
treacherous
rocks
were
affrighting
they
bereft
her
of
trust
in
her
own
limbs
she
seemed
to
slip
here
and
there
without
power
to
check
herself
she
expected
at
any
moment
to
stumble
helplessly
on
some
cruelly
sharp
angle
of
a
granite
boulder
and
find
that
she
was
maimed
so
badly
as
to
render
another
step
impossible
more
than
once
she
was
sensible
that
the
restraining
pull
on
the
rope
alone
held
her
from
disaster
her
distress
did
not
hinder
the
growth
of
a
certain
surprise
that
the
american
should
be
so
sure
footed
so
quick
to
judge
her
needs
when
by
his
help
a
headlong
downward
plunge
was
converted
into
a
harmless
slide
over
the
sloping
face
of
a
rock
she
half
turned
i
must
thank
you
for
that
afterward
she
said
with
a
fine
effort
at
a
smile
eyes
front
please
was
the
quiet
answer
under
less
strenuous
conditions
it
might
have
sounded
curt
but
the
look
that
met
hers
robbed
the
words
of
their
tenseness
and
sent
the
hot
blood
tingling
in
her
veins
bower
had
never
looked
at
her
like
that
just
as
some
unusually
vivid
flash
of
lightning
revealed
the
hidden
depths
of
a
crevasse
bringing
plainly
before
the
eye
chinks
and
crannies
not
discernible
in
the
strongest
sunlight
so
did
the
glimpse
of
spencer
soul
illumine
her
understanding
he
was
not
only
safeguarding
her
but
thinking
of
her
and
the
stolen
knowledge
set
up
a
bewildering
tumult
in
her
heart
attention
shouted
barth
halting
and
making
a
drive
at
something
with
his
ax
the
line
stopped
stampa
ringing
voice
came
over
helen
head
what
is
that
ahead
there
a
new
fall
i
think
we
ought
to
leave
the
moraine
a
little
lower
down
but
this
was
not
here
when
we
ascended
how
either
man
stampa
especially
could
see
anything
at
all
was
beyond
the
girl
comprehension
the
snow
was
absolutely
blinding
the
wind
was
full
in
their
faces
and
it
carried
the
huge
flakes
upward
they
seemed
to
spring
from
beneath
rather
than
drop
from
the
clouds
ever
and
anon
a
weirdly
blue
gleam
of
lightning
would
give
a
demoniac
touch
to
a
scene
worthy
of
the
inferno
make
for
the
ice
quick
cried
stampa
and
barth
turned
sharply
to
the
left
falling
stones
were
now
their
chief
danger
and
both
men
were
anxious
to
avoid
it
after
a
brief
scramble
they
mounted
the
curving
glacier
a
fiercer
gust
shrieked
at
them
and
swept
some
small
space
clear
of
snow
helen
had
a
dim
vision
of
lightning
playing
above
the
crest
of
a
great
mound
on
the
edge
of
the
ice
field
a
mound
that
she
did
not
remember
seeing
before
then
the
gale
sank
back
to
its
sustained
howling
the
snow
swirled
in
denser
volume
and
the
specter
vanished
ere
they
had
gone
another
hundred
yards
barth
hoarse
warning
checked
them
again
the
bridge
has
fallen
was
his
cry
there
has
been
an
ice
movement
there
was
a
question
in
the
man
words
here
was
a
nice
point
submitted
to
his
judgment
whether
to
follow
the
line
of
the
recently
formed
schrund
yawning
at
his
feet
or
endeavor
to
cross
it
or
go
back
to
the
scene
of
the
landslip
that
was
where
barth
was
lacking
in
that
instant
he
resigned
his
pride
of
place
without
further
effort
to
retain
it
he
was
in
the
van
but
did
not
lead
thenceforth
stampa
was
master
what
is
the
width
ten
meters
demanded
the
old
guide
cheerfully
about
that
all
the
better
it
is
not
deep
here
the
shock
of
that
avalanche
opened
it
up
you
will
find
a
way
down
cut
the
steps
close
together
you
know
how
to
polish
them
karl
yes
i
can
do
that
said
the
porter
and
watch
the
feet
yes
i
take
care
barth
was
peering
fixedly
into
the
chasm
to
helen
fancy
it
was
bottomless
though
in
reality
it
was
not
more
than
forty
feet
deep
and
the
two
walls
fell
away
from
each
other
at
a
practicable
angle
in
normal
summer
weather
a
small
crevasse
always
formed
there
owing
to
the
glacier
flowing
over
a
transverse
ridge
of
rock
beneath
the
impact
of
many
thousands
of
tons
of
débris
had
disrupted
the
ice
to
an
unusual
extent
having
decided
on
the
best
line
the
leading
guide
stepped
over
into
space
helen
heard
his
ax
ringing
as
he
fashioned
secure
foothold
down
the
steep
ledge
he
had
selected
he
was
quite
trustworthy
in
such
work
stampa
who
had
a
thought
for
none
save
helen
gave
her
a
reassuring
word
barth
will
find
a
way
he
said
and
herr
spencer
knows
how
you
should
cross
your
feet
and
carry
your
ax
while
karl
will
see
to
your
foothold
remember
too
that
you
will
be
at
the
bottom
before
i
begin
the
descent
so
no
harm
can
come
to
you
try
and
stand
straight
do
lean
against
the
slope
lean
away
from
it
do
be
afraid
do
trust
to
the
rope
or
the
grip
of
the
ax
rely
on
your
own
stand
it
was
no
time
to
pick
and
choose
phrases
yet
helen
realized
the
oddity
of
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
bower
one
other
in
the
party
had
a
thought
somewhat
akin
to
hers
but
he
slurred
it
over
in
his
mind
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
help
her
by
a
casual
remark
guess
you
hardly
expected
genuine
ice
work
in
trip
he
said
stampa
and
i
had
a
lot
of
it
last
week
it
as
easy
as
walking
down
stairs
when
you
know
how
i
do
think
i
am
afraid
she
answered
but
i
should
have
preferred
to
walk
up
stairs
first
this
is
rather
reversing
the
natural
order
of
things
is
it
nature
loves
irregularities
that
is
why
the
prize
girl
in
every
novel
has
irregular
features
a
heroine
with
a
greek
face
would
kill
a
whole
library
es
geht
barth
gruff
voice
sounded
hollow
from
the
depths
karl
in
his
turn
went
over
the
lip
of
the
crevasse
helen
conscious
of
an
exaltation
that
lifted
her
out
of
the
region
of
ignoble
fear
looked
down
she
could
see
now
what
was
being
done
barth
was
swinging
his
ax
and
smiting
the
ice
with
the
adz
his
head
was
just
below
the
level
of
her
feet
though
he
was
distant
the
full
length
of
two
sections
of
the
rope
he
had
cut
broad
black
steps
they
did
not
seem
to
present
any
great
difficulty
helen
found
herself
speculating
on
the
remarkable
light
effects
that
made
these
notches
black
in
a
wall
right
foot
first
said
spencer
quietly
when
that
is
firmly
fixed
throw
all
your
weight
on
it
and
bring
the
left
down
then
the
right
again
hold
the
pick
breast
high
so
cried
karl
appreciatively
watching
her
first
successful
effort
as
spencer
was
lowering
himself
into
the
crevasse
he
heard
something
that
set
his
nimble
wits
agog
stampa
the
valiant
and
light
hearted
stampa
the
genial
companion
who
had
laughed
and
jested
even
when
they
were
crossing
an
ice
slope
on
the
giant
monte
della
disgrazia
a
traverse
of
precarious
clinging
where
a
slip
meant
death
a
thousand
feet
below
was
muttering
strangely
at
bower
he
was
saying
if
any
evil
befalls
the
i
shall
drive
my
ax
between
your
shoulder
blades
there
was
no
reply
spencer
was
sure
he
was
not
mistaken
though
the
guide
spoke
german
he
knew
enough
of
that
language
to
understand
this
comparatively
simple
sentence
quite
as
amazing
as
stampa
threat
was
bower
silent
acceptance
of
it
he
began
to
piece
together
some
fleeting
impressions
of
the
curious
wrangle
between
the
two
outside
the
hut
he
recalled
bower
extraordinary
change
of
tone
when
told
that
a
man
named
christian
stampa
had
followed
him
from
maloja
helen
was
just
taking
another
confident
step
forward
and
down
balancing
herself
with
graceful
assurance
spencer
had
a
few
seconds
in
which
to
steal
a
backward
glance
and
a
flash
of
lightning
happened
to
glimmer
on
bower
features
the
american
was
not
given
to
fanciful
imaginings
but
during
many
a
wild
hour
in
the
far
west
he
had
seen
the
baleful
frown
of
murder
on
a
man
face
too
often
not
to
recognize
it
now
in
this
snow
scourged
cleft
of
a
mighty
alpine
glacier
yet
he
was
helpless
he
could
neither
speak
nor
act
on
a
mere
opinion
he
could
only
watch
and
be
on
his
guard
from
that
moment
he
tried
to
observe
every
movement
not
only
of
helen
but
of
bower
the
members
of
the
party
were
roped
at
intervals
of
twenty
feet
allowing
for
the
depth
of
the
crevasse
the
amount
of
rope
taken
up
in
their
hands
ready
to
be
served
out
as
occasion
required
and
the
inclination
of
barth
line
of
descent
the
latter
ought
to
be
notching
the
opposing
wall
before
stampa
quitted
the
surface
of
the
glacier
though
spencer
could
not
see
stampa
now
he
knew
that
the
rear
guide
was
bracing
himself
strongly
against
any
jerk
with
the
additional
security
of
an
anchor
obtained
by
driving
the
pick
of
his
ax
deeply
into
the
surface
ice
it
was
bower
business
to
keep
the
rope
quite
taut
both
above
and
below
but
the
american
was
sure
that
he
was
gathering
the
slack
behind
him
with
his
right
hand
while
he
carried
the
ax
in
his
left
and
did
not
use
it
to
steady
himself
spencer
assumed
from
various
comments
by
helen
and
others
that
bower
was
an
adept
climber
therefore
the
passage
of
a
schrund
or
large
shallow
crevasse
was
child
play
to
him
this
departure
from
all
the
canons
of
the
craft
as
imparted
by
stampa
during
their
first
week
on
the
hills
together
struck
spencer
as
exceedingly
dangerous
he
reflected
that
were
it
not
for
the
words
he
had
overheard
he
would
never
have
known
of
this
curious
proceeding
indeed
but
for
those
words
with
their
sinister
significance
augmented
by
bower
devilish
expression
had
he
even
looked
back
by
chance
the
maneuver
might
not
have
attracted
his
attention
what
then
did
it
imply
why
should
a
skilled
mountaineer
break
an
imperative
rule
that
permits
of
no
exceptions
he
continued
to
watch
bower
even
more
closely
he
devoted
to
the
task
every
instant
that
consideration
for
helen
safety
and
his
own
would
allow
there
was
not
much
light
in
the
crevasse
heavy
clouds
and
the
smothering
snow
wraiths
hid
the
travelers
under
a
dense
pall
that
suggested
the
approach
of
night
although
the
actual
time
was
about
half
past
one
in
the
afternoon
the
wind
seemed
to
delight
in
torturing
them
with
minute
particles
of
ice
that
stung
with
a
peculiar
sensation
of
burning
these
were
bad
enough
to
add
to
their
miseries
fine
powdery
snowflakes
settled
on
eyes
and
eyelids
with
blinding
effect
during
a
particularly
baffling
gust
helen
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
instantly
spencer
stiffened
himself
and
barth
and
karl
halted
it
is
nothing
she
cried
for
a
second
i
could
not
see
barth
ax
rang
out
again
the
vibrations
of
each
lusty
blow
could
be
felt
distinctly
along
the
solid
ice
wall
after
a
last
downward
step
he
would
begin
to
notch
his
way
up
the
other
side
where
the
angle
was
much
more
favorable
to
rapid
progress
spencer
stole
another
glance
over
his
shoulder
bower
had
fully
ten
feet
of
the
rearmost
section
of
rope
in
hand
his
head
was
thrown
well
back
standing
with
his
face
to
the
ice
he
was
striving
to
look
over
the
lip
of
the
schrund
stampa
feeling
a
steady
tension
must
be
expecting
the
announcement
momentarily
that
barth
was
crossing
the
narrow
crevice
at
the
bottom
helen
and
karl
intent
on
the
operations
of
the
leader
paid
heed
to
nothing
else
but
spencer
was
fascinated
by
bower
peculiar
actions
at
last
barth
deep
bass
reverberated
triumphantly
upward
stampa
repeated
bower
suddenly
changing
the
ice
ax
to
his
right
hand
and
stretching
the
left
as
far
along
the
rope
and
as
high
up
as
possible
simultaneously
he
raised
the
ax
then
and
not
till
then
did
spencer
understand
stampa
must
be
on
the
point
of
relaxing
his
grip
and
preparing
to
descend
if
bower
cut
the
rope
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
adz
a
violent
tug
at
the
sundered
end
would
precipitate
stampa
headlong
into
the
crevasse
while
there
would
be
ample
evidence
to
show
that
he
had
himself
severed
the
rope
by
a
miscalculated
blow
the
fall
would
surely
kill
him
when
his
corpse
was
recovered
it
would
be
found
that
the
cut
had
been
made
much
closer
to
his
own
body
than
to
that
of
his
nearest
neighbor
stop
roared
spencer
all
with
wrath
at
his
discovery
obedience
to
the
climbers
law
held
the
others
rigid
that
command
implied
danger
it
called
for
an
instant
tightening
of
every
muscle
to
withstand
the
strain
of
a
slip
even
bower
a
man
on
the
very
brink
of
committing
a
fiendish
crime
yielded
to
a
subconscious
acceptance
of
the
law
and
kept
himself
braced
in
his
steps
the
american
was
well
fitted
to
handle
a
crisis
of
that
nature
hold
fast
stampa
he
shouted
what
is
wrong
came
the
ready
cry
for
the
rear
guide
had
already
driven
the
pick
of
his
ax
into
the
ice
again
after
having
withdrawn
it
then
spencer
spoke
english
i
happen
to
be
watching
you
he
said
slowly
never
relaxing
a
scrutiny
of
bower
livid
face
you
seem
to
forget
what
you
are
doing
follow
me
until
you
have
taken
up
the
slack
of
the
rope
do
you
understand
bower
continued
to
gaze
at
him
with
eyes
all
he
realized
was
that
his
murderous
design
was
frustrated
but
how
or
why
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
do
you
hear
me
demanded
spencer
even
more
sternly
come
along
or
i
shall
explain
myself
more
fully
without
answering
the
other
made
shift
to
move
spencer
however
meant
to
save
the
unwitting
guide
from
further
hazard
do
stir
stampa
till
i
give
the
order
he
sang
out
all
right
monsieur
but
we
are
losing
time
what
is
barth
doing
there
if
i
were
in
front
bower
who
owned
certain
strong
qualities
swallowed
something
took
three
strides
downward
and
said
calmly
i
was
waiting
to
give
stampa
a
hand
he
is
lame
you
know
helen
of
course
heard
all
that
passed
she
had
long
since
abandoned
the
effort
to
disentangle
the
skein
of
that
day
events
everybody
was
talking
and
acting
unnaturally
perhaps
the
ravel
of
things
would
clear
itself
when
they
regained
the
commonplace
world
of
the
hotel
in
any
case
she
wished
the
men
would
hurry
for
it
was
unutterably
cold
in
the
crevasse
at
last
then
there
was
a
movement
ahead
barth
began
to
mount
muttering
an
instruction
to
karl
that
he
was
to
give
the
girl
a
friendly
pull
he
cut
smaller
steps
more
widely
apart
and
at
a
steeper
gradient
soon
they
were
on
the
floor
of
the
ice
and
hurrying
to
the
next
bridge
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
anyone
the
fury
of
the
gale
and
the
ever
gathering
snow
made
it
imperative
that
not
a
moment
should
be
wasted
the
lightning
was
decreasing
perceptibly
while
the
occasional
peals
of
thunder
were
scarcely
audible
above
the
soughing
of
the
wind
a
tremendous
crash
on
the
right
announced
the
fall
of
another
avalanche
but
it
did
not
affect
the
next
broad
crevasse
the
bridge
they
had
used
a
few
hours
earlier
stood
firm
indeed
it
was
new
welded
by
regelation
since
the
sun
rays
had
disappeared
the
leader
kept
a
perfect
line
never
deviating
from
the
right
track
helen
who
had
completely
lost
her
bearings
thought
they
had
a
long
way
farther
to
go
when
she
saw
barth
stop
and
begin
to
unfasten
the
rope
then
a
thrust
with
the
butt
of
her
told
her
that
she
was
standing
on
rock
when
she
cleared
her
eyes
of
the
flying
snow
she
saw
a
well
defined
curving
ribbon
amid
the
white
chaos
it
was
the
path
covered
six
inches
deep
the
violent
exertions
of
nearly
three
hours
since
she
left
the
hut
had
induced
a
pleasant
sense
of
languor
did
she
dare
to
suggest
it
she
would
have
liked
to
sit
down
and
rest
for
awhile
bower
who
had
substituted
reasoned
thought
for
his
madness
addressed
spencer
with
easy
complacence
while
barth
was
unroping
them
why
did
you
believe
that
i
was
doing
a
risky
thing
in
stopping
to
assist
stampa
he
asked
i
guess
you
know
best
was
the
uncompromising
answer
yes
i
think
i
do
of
course
i
could
not
argue
the
matter
then
but
i
fancy
my
climbing
experience
is
far
greater
than
yours
mr
spencer
his
sheer
impudence
was
admirable
he
even
smiled
in
the
superior
way
of
an
expert
lecturing
a
novice
but
spencer
did
not
smile
do
you
really
want
to
hear
my
views
on
your
conduct
he
said
no
thanks
the
discussion
might
prove
interesting
but
we
can
adjourn
it
to
the
coffee
and
cigar
period
after
dinner
his
eyes
fell
under
spencer
contemptuous
glance
yet
he
carried
himself
bravely
though
the
man
he
meant
to
kill
and
another
man
who
had
read
his
inmost
thought
in
time
to
prevent
a
tragedy
were
looking
at
him
fixedly
he
turned
away
with
a
laugh
on
his
lips
i
am
afraid
miss
wynton
you
will
regard
me
in
future
as
a
broken
reed
where
alpine
excursions
are
concerned
he
said
you
were
mistaken
that
is
obvious
said
helen
frankly
but
so
was
barth
he
agreed
that
the
storm
would
be
only
a
passing
affair
you
think
we
are
very
deeply
indebted
to
spencer
and
stampa
for
coming
to
our
assistance
i
do
indeed
stampa
one
can
reward
in
kind
this
sort
of
thing
used
to
be
his
business
i
hear
as
for
spencer
a
smile
from
you
will
repay
him
tenfold
herr
spencer
broke
in
stampa
you
go
on
with
the
and
see
that
she
does
not
slip
she
is
tired
marcus
bauer
and
i
have
matters
to
discuss
the
old
man
unwonted
harshness
appealed
to
the
girl
as
did
the
host
of
other
queer
happenings
on
that
memorable
day
bower
moved
uneasily
a
vindictive
gleam
shot
from
his
eyes
helen
missed
none
of
this
but
she
was
fatigued
and
her
feet
were
cold
and
wet
while
the
sleet
encountered
on
the
upper
glacier
had
almost
soaked
her
to
the
skin
nevertheless
she
strove
bravely
to
lighten
the
cloud
that
seemed
to
have
settled
on
the
men
that
means
a
wordy
warfare
she
said
gayly
i
pity
you
bower
you
can
not
wriggle
out
of
your
difficulty
the
snow
will
soon
be
a
foot
deep
in
the
valley
goodness
only
knows
what
would
have
become
of
us
up
there
in
the
hut
he
bowed
gracefully
with
a
hint
of
the
foreign
air
she
had
noted
once
before
i
would
have
brought
you
safely
out
of
greater
perils
he
said
but
every
dog
has
his
day
and
this
is
stampa
route
cried
the
guide
impatiently
he
loathed
the
sight
of
bower
standing
there
smiling
and
courteous
in
the
presence
of
one
whom
he
regarded
as
a
friend
and
protectress
spencer
attributed
his
surliness
to
its
true
cause
it
supplied
another
bit
of
the
mosaic
he
was
slowly
piecing
together
greatly
as
he
preferred
helen
company
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
at
least
ten
minutes
of
it
could
he
but
listen
to
the
discussion
between
stampa
and
bower
therein
he
would
have
erred
greatly
helen
was
tired
and
she
admitted
it
she
did
not
decline
his
aid
when
the
path
was
steep
and
slippery
in
delightful
snatches
of
talk
they
managed
to
say
a
good
deal
to
each
other
and
helen
did
not
fail
to
make
plain
the
exact
circumstances
under
which
she
first
caught
sight
of
spencer
outside
the
hut
when
they
arrived
at
the
carriage
road
which
begins
at
lake
cavloccio
they
could
walk
side
by
side
and
chat
freely
here
in
the
valley
matters
were
normal
the
snow
did
not
place
such
a
veil
on
all
things
the
windings
of
the
road
often
brought
them
abreast
of
the
four
men
in
the
rear
bower
was
trudging
along
alone
holding
his
head
down
and
seemingly
lost
in
thought
close
behind
him
came
stampa
and
the
engadiners
karl
of
course
was
talking
the
others
might
or
might
not
be
lending
their
ears
to
his
interminable
gossip
we
are
outstripping
our
companions
do
you
think
we
ought
to
wait
for
them
said
helen
once
when
bower
chanced
to
look
her
way
no
said
spencer
you
are
exceedingly
positive
i
tried
to
be
exceedingly
negative
but
why
i
rather
fancy
that
they
would
jar
on
us
but
stampa
promised
lecture
appears
to
have
ended
i
think
it
never
began
it
is
a
safe
bet
that
bower
and
he
have
not
exchanged
a
word
since
our
last
halt
helen
laughed
a
genuine
case
of
greek
meeting
greek
she
said
stampa
is
an
excellent
guide
i
am
sure
but
bower
does
really
know
these
mountains
i
suppose
anyone
is
liable
to
err
in
forecasting
alpine
weather
that
is
nothing
if
it
were
you
or
i
stampa
would
dismiss
the
point
with
a
grin
you
heard
how
he
chaffed
barth
yet
trusted
him
with
the
lead
no
these
two
have
an
old
feud
to
settle
you
will
hear
more
of
it
a
feud
bower
declared
to
me
that
stampa
was
absolutely
unknown
to
him
it
is
necessary
to
know
a
man
before
you
hate
him
i
can
give
you
a
heap
of
historic
examples
for
instance
who
has
a
good
word
to
say
for
ananias
the
girl
understood
that
he
meant
to
parry
her
question
with
a
quip
the
cross
purposes
so
much
in
evidence
all
day
were
baffling
and
mysterious
to
its
close
my
own
opinion
is
that
both
you
and
stampa
have
taken
an
unreasonable
dislike
to
bower
she
said
determinedly
the
words
were
out
before
she
quite
realized
their
import
she
flushed
a
little
spencer
was
gazing
down
into
the
gorge
of
the
orlegna
the
brawling
torrent
chimed
with
his
own
mood
but
his
set
face
gave
no
token
of
the
storm
within
he
only
said
quietly
how
good
it
must
be
to
have
you
as
a
friend
i
have
no
reason
to
feel
other
than
friendly
to
bower
she
protested
hotly
it
was
the
rarest
good
fortune
for
me
that
he
came
to
maloja
i
met
him
once
in
london
and
a
second
time
by
accident
during
my
journey
to
switzerland
yet
widely
known
as
he
is
in
society
he
was
sufficiently
large
minded
to
disregard
the
sneers
and
innuendoes
of
some
of
those
horrid
women
in
the
hotel
he
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
show
me
every
kindness
why
should
i
not
repay
it
by
speaking
well
of
him
i
shall
lay
my
head
on
the
nearest
tree
stump
and
you
can
smite
me
with
your
ax
good
and
hard
said
spencer
she
laughed
angrily
i
do
know
what
evil
influence
is
possessing
us
she
cried
everything
is
awry
even
the
sun
refuses
to
shine
here
am
i
storming
at
one
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
no
he
broke
in
decisively
do
put
it
that
way
because
the
whole
credit
of
the
relief
expedition
is
due
to
stampa
say
miss
wynton
may
i
square
my
small
services
by
asking
a
favor
oh
yes
indeed
well
then
if
it
lies
in
your
power
keep
stampa
and
bower
apart
in
any
event
do
intervene
in
their
quarrel
so
you
are
quite
serious
in
your
belief
that
there
is
a
quarrel
the
american
saw
again
in
his
mind
eye
the
scene
in
the
crevasse
when
bower
had
raised
his
ax
to
strike
quite
serious
he
replied
and
the
gravity
in
his
voice
was
so
marked
that
helen
placed
a
contrite
hand
on
his
arm
for
an
instant
please
i
am
sorry
if
i
was
rude
to
you
just
now
she
said
i
have
had
a
long
day
and
my
nerves
are
worn
to
a
fine
edge
i
used
to
flatter
myself
that
i
had
any
nerves
but
they
have
come
to
the
surface
here
it
must
be
the
thin
air
then
it
is
a
bad
place
for
an
american
ah
that
reminds
me
of
something
i
had
forgotten
i
meant
to
ask
you
how
you
came
to
remain
in
the
maloja
is
that
too
inquisitive
on
my
part
i
can
account
for
the
presence
of
the
other
americans
in
the
hotel
they
belong
to
the
paris
colony
and
are
interested
in
tennis
and
golf
i
have
not
seen
you
playing
either
game
in
fact
you
moon
about
in
solitary
grandeur
like
myself
and
oh
dear
what
a
string
of
questions
is
it
true
that
you
wanted
to
play
baccarat
with
bower
for
a
thousand
pounds
it
is
true
that
i
agreed
to
share
a
bank
with
dunston
and
the
figure
you
mention
was
suggested
but
i
backed
out
of
the
proposition
why
because
your
friend
hare
thought
he
was
responsible
in
a
sense
having
introduced
me
to
dunston
so
i
let
up
on
the
idea
just
to
stop
him
from
feeling
bad
about
it
you
really
meant
to
play
in
the
first
instance
yes
well
it
was
very
wicked
of
you
only
the
other
day
you
were
telling
me
how
hard
you
had
to
work
before
you
saved
your
first
thousand
pounds
from
that
point
of
view
my
conduct
was
idiotic
but
i
would
like
to
carry
the
story
a
little
further
miss
wynton
i
was
in
a
mood
that
night
to
oppose
bower
for
a
much
more
valuable
stake
if
the
chance
offered
it
is
rather
shocking
said
helen
i
suppose
so
of
course
there
are
prizes
in
life
that
can
not
be
measured
by
monetary
standards
he
was
not
looking
at
the
orlegna
now
and
the
girl
by
his
side
well
knew
it
the
great
revelation
that
flooded
her
soul
with
light
while
crossing
the
forno
came
back
with
renewed
power
she
did
not
pretend
to
herself
that
the
words
were
devoid
of
a
hidden
meaning
and
her
heart
fluttered
with
subtle
ecstasy
but
she
was
proud
and
self
reliant
so
proud
that
she
crushed
the
tumult
in
her
breast
so
self
reliant
that
she
was
able
to
give
him
a
timid
smile
that
deals
with
the
second
head
of
the
indictment
then
she
said
lightly
now
for
the
first
why
did
you
select
the
engadine
for
your
holiday
if
i
could
tell
you
that
i
should
know
something
of
the
occult
impulses
that
govern
men
lives
one
minute
i
was
in
london
meaning
to
go
north
the
next
i
was
hurrying
to
buy
a
ticket
for
st
moritz
but
she
meant
to
continue
you
arrived
here
the
same
day
as
i
did
somehow
that
did
not
sound
quite
the
right
thing
to
say
her
tongue
tripped
but
she
forced
herself
to
frame
a
sentence
it
is
odd
that
you
like
myself
should
have
hit
upon
an
out
of
the
way
place
like
maloja
the
difference
is
that
i
was
sent
here
whereas
you
came
of
your
own
free
will
i
guess
you
are
right
said
he
laughing
as
though
she
had
uttered
an
exquisite
joke
yes
that
is
just
it
i
can
imagine
two
young
english
swallows
meeting
in
algeria
in
the
winter
twittering
explanations
of
the
same
sort
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
a
swallow
and
i
am
sure
i
ca
twitter
and
as
for
algeria
a
home
of
sunshine
well
just
look
at
it
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
darkening
panorama
of
hills
and
pine
woods
all
etched
in
black
lines
and
masses
where
rocks
and
trees
and
houses
broke
the
dead
white
of
the
snow
mantle
they
happened
to
be
crossing
a
bridge
that
spans
the
orlegna
before
it
takes
its
first
frantic
plunge
towards
italy
bower
who
had
quickened
his
pace
took
the
gesture
as
a
signal
and
sent
an
answering
flourish
helen
stopped
he
evidently
wished
to
overtake
them
more
explanations
murmured
spencer
but
he
was
mistaken
i
was
calling
nature
to
witness
that
your
simile
was
not
justified
tell
you
what
he
said
in
a
low
voice
if
this
storm
has
blown
over
by
the
morning
meet
me
after
breakfast
and
we
will
walk
down
the
valley
to
vicosoprano
for
luncheon
there
is
a
diligence
back
in
the
afternoon
we
can
stroll
there
in
three
hours
and
i
shall
have
time
to
clear
up
this
swallow
proposition
that
will
be
delightful
if
the
weather
improves
it
will
i
will
compel
it
bower
was
nearing
them
rapidly
a
constrained
silence
fell
between
them
to
end
it
helen
cried
well
are
you
feeling
duly
humbled
mr
bower
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
her
meaning
apparently
he
might
have
forgotten
that
stampa
still
lived
then
he
roused
his
wits
with
an
effort
not
humbled
but
elated
he
said
have
i
not
led
you
to
feats
of
why
the
wragg
girls
will
be
green
with
envy
when
they
hear
of
your
exploits
he
swung
round
the
corner
to
the
bridge
after
a
smiling
glance
at
spencer
impassive
face
he
turned
to
helen
you
have
come
out
of
the
ordeal
with
flying
colors
he
said
that
flower
you
picked
on
the
way
up
has
not
withered
give
it
to
me
as
a
memento
the
words
were
almost
a
challenge
the
girl
hesitated
no
she
said
i
must
find
you
some
other
souvenir
but
i
want
that
if
there
is
no
you
forget
that
i
took
it
from
from
the
boulder
marked
by
a
cross
i
am
not
superstitious
nor
am
i
nevertheless
i
should
not
care
to
give
you
such
a
symbol
she
caught
bower
and
spencer
exchanging
a
strange
look
these
men
shared
some
secret
that
they
sedulously
kept
from
her
perhaps
the
american
meant
to
enlighten
her
during
their
projected
walk
to
vicosoprano
stampa
and
the
others
approached
together
they
climbed
the
little
hill
leading
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
in
the
village
they
said
good
night
to
the
two
guides
and
karl
helen
promised
laughingly
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
johann
cat
at
the
first
opportunity
she
was
passing
through
a
wicket
that
protects
the
footpath
across
the
golf
links
when
she
heard
stampa
growl
früh
snapped
bower
she
smiled
to
herself
at
the
thought
that
things
were
going
to
happen
she
was
right
but
she
had
not
yet
done
with
the
present
day
when
she
entered
the
cozy
and
brilliantly
lighted
veranda
of
the
hotel
the
first
person
her
amazed
eyes
alighted
upon
was
millicent
jaques
chapter
xi
wherein
helen
lives
a
crowded
hour
millicent
you
here
helen
breathed
the
words
in
an
undertone
that
carried
more
than
a
hint
of
dismay
it
was
one
of
those
rare
crises
in
life
when
the
brain
receives
a
presage
of
evil
without
any
prior
foundation
of
fact
helen
had
every
reason
to
welcome
her
friend
none
to
be
chilled
by
her
unexpected
presence
among
a
small
circle
of
intimate
acquaintances
she
counted
millicent
jaques
the
best
and
truest
they
had
drifted
apart
but
that
was
owing
to
helen
lack
of
means
she
was
not
able
nor
did
she
aspire
to
mix
in
the
society
that
hailed
the
actress
as
a
bright
particular
star
yet
it
meant
much
to
a
girl
earning
her
daily
bread
in
a
heedless
city
that
she
should
possess
one
friend
of
her
own
age
and
sex
who
could
speak
of
the
golden
years
when
they
were
children
together
the
years
when
helen
father
was
the
prospective
governor
of
an
indian
province
as
large
as
france
when
the
tuft
hunters
now
gathered
in
maloja
would
have
fawned
on
her
mother
in
hope
of
subsequent
recognition
why
then
did
helen
falter
in
her
greeting
who
can
tell
she
herself
did
not
know
unless
it
was
that
millicent
rose
so
leisurely
from
the
table
at
which
she
was
drinking
a
belated
cup
of
tea
and
came
toward
her
with
a
smile
that
had
no
warmth
in
it
so
you
have
returned
she
said
and
with
both
cavaliers
helen
was
conscious
of
a
queer
humming
noise
in
her
head
she
was
incapable
of
calm
thought
she
realized
now
that
the
friend
she
had
left
in
london
was
here
in
the
guise
of
a
bitter
enemy
the
veranda
was
full
of
people
waiting
for
the
post
the
snow
had
banished
them
from
links
and
tennis
court
this
august
afternoon
was
dark
as
at
the
same
hour
but
the
rendezvous
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
reappearance
of
the
climbers
whose
chances
of
safety
had
been
eagerly
debated
since
the
snow
storm
began
drew
all
eyes
someone
had
whispered
too
that
the
beautiful
woman
who
arrived
from
moritz
half
an
hour
earlier
who
sat
in
her
furs
and
sipped
her
tea
after
a
long
conversation
with
a
clerk
in
the
bureau
was
none
other
than
millicent
jaques
the
dancer
one
of
the
leading
lights
of
english
musical
comedy
the
peepers
and
whisperers
little
dreamed
that
she
could
be
awaiting
the
party
from
the
forno
now
that
her
vigil
was
explained
for
bower
had
advanced
with
ready
smile
and
outstretched
hand
the
wraggs
and
vavasours
and
de
la
veres
all
the
little
coterie
of
gossips
and
scandalmongers
were
drawn
to
the
center
of
the
hall
like
steel
filings
to
a
magnet
millicent
ignored
bower
she
was
young
enough
and
pretty
enough
to
feel
sure
of
her
ability
to
deal
with
him
subsequently
her
cornflower
blue
eyes
glittered
they
held
something
of
the
quiet
menace
of
a
crevasse
she
had
traveled
far
for
revenge
and
she
did
not
mean
to
forego
it
helen
whose
second
impulse
was
to
kiss
her
affectionately
with
excited
clamor
of
welcome
and
inquiry
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
by
her
friend
strange
words
i
i
am
so
surprised
she
half
stammered
in
an
agony
of
confused
doubt
and
that
was
the
only
lame
phrase
she
could
utter
during
a
few
trying
seconds
bower
frowned
he
hated
scenes
between
women
with
his
first
glimpse
of
millicent
he
guessed
her
errand
for
helen
sake
in
the
presence
of
that
crowd
he
would
not
brook
the
unmerited
flood
of
sarcastic
indignation
which
he
knew
was
trembling
on
her
lips
miss
wynton
has
had
an
exhausting
day
he
said
coolly
she
must
go
straight
to
her
room
and
rest
you
two
can
meet
and
talk
after
dinner
without
further
preamble
he
took
helen
arm
millicent
barred
the
way
she
did
not
give
place
again
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
man
i
shall
not
detain
you
long
she
said
looking
only
at
helen
and
speaking
in
a
low
clear
voice
that
her
stage
training
rendered
audible
throughout
the
large
hall
i
only
wished
to
assure
myself
that
what
i
was
told
was
true
i
found
it
hard
to
believe
even
when
i
saw
your
name
written
up
in
the
hotel
before
i
go
let
me
congratulate
you
on
your
conquest
and
mark
bower
on
his
she
added
with
clever
pretense
of
afterthought
helen
continued
to
stare
at
her
helplessly
her
lips
quivered
but
they
uttered
no
sound
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
object
she
meant
to
wound
and
insult
in
the
grossest
way
bower
dropped
helen
arm
and
strode
close
to
the
woman
who
had
struck
this
shrewd
blow
at
him
i
give
you
this
one
chance
he
muttered
while
his
eyes
blazed
into
hers
go
to
your
room
or
sit
down
somewhere
till
i
am
free
i
shall
come
to
you
and
put
things
straight
that
now
seem
crooked
you
are
wrong
horribly
wrong
in
your
suspicions
wait
my
explanation
or
by
all
that
i
hold
sacred
you
will
regret
it
to
your
dying
hour
millicent
drew
back
a
little
she
conveyed
the
suggestion
that
his
nearness
was
offensive
to
her
nostrils
and
she
laughed
with
due
semblance
of
real
amusement
what
has
she
made
a
fool
of
you
too
she
cried
bitingly
then
helen
did
exactly
the
thing
she
ought
not
to
have
done
she
fainted
spencer
in
his
own
vivid
phrase
was
looking
for
trouble
the
instant
he
caught
sight
of
the
actress
had
some
magic
lantern
focused
on
the
screen
of
his
inner
consciousness
a
complete
narrative
of
the
circumstances
which
conspired
to
bring
millicent
jaques
to
the
upper
engadine
he
could
not
have
mastered
cause
and
effect
more
fully
the
unlucky
letter
he
asked
mackenzie
to
send
to
the
wellington
theater
the
letter
devised
as
a
probe
into
motives
but
which
was
now
cruelly
searching
its
author
heart
had
undoubtedly
supplied
to
a
slighted
woman
the
clew
to
her
identity
better
posted
than
bower
in
the
true
history
of
visit
to
switzerland
he
did
not
fail
to
catch
the
most
significant
word
in
millicent
scornful
greeting
and
with
cavaliers
in
all
probability
she
knew
the
whole
ridiculous
story
reading
into
it
the
meaning
lent
by
jealous
spleen
and
no
more
to
be
convinced
of
error
than
the
forno
glacier
could
be
made
to
flow
backward
illustration
no
said
spencer
ring
for
the
elevator
but
if
his
soul
was
vexed
by
a
sense
of
bygone
folly
his
brain
was
cool
and
alert
he
saw
helen
sway
slightly
he
caught
her
before
she
collapsed
where
she
stood
he
gathered
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
she
might
have
been
a
tired
child
fallen
asleep
too
soon
her
limp
head
rested
on
his
shoulder
through
the
meshes
of
her
blue
veil
he
could
see
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
cheeks
the
tint
of
the
silk
added
to
the
lifelessness
of
her
aspect
just
then
spencer
heart
was
sore
within
him
and
he
was
an
awkward
man
to
oppose
george
de
courcy
vavasour
happened
to
crane
his
neck
nearer
at
the
wrong
moment
the
american
sent
him
flying
with
a
vigorous
elbow
thrust
he
shoved
bower
aside
with
scant
ceremony
millicent
jaques
met
a
steely
glance
that
quelled
the
vengeful
sparkle
in
her
own
eyes
and
caused
her
to
move
quickly
lest
perchance
this
american
should
trample
on
her
before
bower
could
recover
his
balance
for
his
hobnails
caused
him
to
slip
on
the
tiled
floor
spencer
was
halfway
across
the
inner
hall
and
approaching
the
elevator
an
official
of
the
hotel
hastened
forward
with
ready
proffer
of
help
this
way
he
said
sympathetically
the
lady
was
overcome
by
the
heat
after
so
many
hours
in
the
intense
cold
it
often
occurs
she
will
recover
soon
bring
her
to
a
chair
in
the
office
but
spencer
was
not
willing
that
helen
first
wondering
glance
should
rest
on
strangers
or
that
when
able
to
walk
to
her
own
apartments
she
should
be
compelled
to
pass
through
the
ranks
of
gapers
in
the
lounge
no
he
said
ring
for
the
elevator
this
lady
must
be
taken
to
her
room
no
i
believe
then
the
manageress
and
a
chambermaid
can
attend
to
her
quick
the
elevator
bower
turned
on
millicent
like
an
angry
bull
you
have
chosen
your
own
method
he
growled
very
well
you
shall
pay
for
it
her
venom
was
such
that
she
was
by
no
means
disturbed
by
his
threat
the
other
man
the
american
who
brought
her
here
seems
to
have
bested
you
throughout
she
taunted
him
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
certain
dignity
he
was
aware
that
every
tongue
in
the
place
was
stilled
that
every
ear
was
tuned
to
catch
each
note
of
this
fantastic
quartet
a
sonata
appassionata
in
which
vibrated
the
souls
of
men
and
women
he
looked
from
millicent
pallid
face
to
the
faces
of
the
listeners
some
of
whom
made
pretense
of
polite
indifference
while
others
did
not
scruple
to
exhibit
their
eager
delight
if
nothing
better
the
episode
would
provide
an
abundance
of
spicy
gossip
during
the
enforced
idleness
caused
by
the
weather
the
lady
whom
you
are
endeavoring
to
malign
will
i
hope
do
me
the
honor
of
becoming
my
wife
he
said
that
being
so
she
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
slanderous
malice
of
an
girl
he
spoke
slowly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
weighed
his
words
a
thrill
that
could
be
felt
ran
through
his
intent
audience
mark
bower
the
millionaire
the
financial
genius
who
dominated
more
than
one
powerful
group
in
the
city
who
controlled
a
ring
of
theaters
in
london
and
the
provinces
who
had
declined
a
knighthood
and
would
surely
be
created
a
peer
with
the
next
change
of
government
that
he
should
openly
declare
himself
a
suitor
for
the
hand
of
a
penniless
girl
was
a
sensation
with
a
vengeance
his
description
of
millicent
as
an
girl
offered
another
to
the
crowd
she
would
never
again
skip
airily
behind
the
footlights
of
the
wellington
or
any
other
important
theater
in
england
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
musical
comedy
candle
that
succeeded
to
the
sacred
lamp
of
west
end
burlesque
was
snuffed
out
millicent
was
actress
enough
not
to
flinch
from
the
goad
a
charming
and
proper
sentiment
she
cried
with
well
simulated
flippancy
the
marriage
of
mark
bower
will
be
quite
a
fashionable
event
provided
always
that
he
secures
the
assent
of
the
american
gentleman
who
is
paying
his
future
wife
expenses
during
her
present
holiday
now
so
curiously
constituted
is
human
nature
or
the
shallow
worldliness
that
passes
current
for
it
among
the
homeless
gadabouts
who
pose
as
british
society
on
the
continent
that
already
the
current
of
opinion
in
the
hotel
was
setting
steadily
in
helen
favor
the
remarkable
change
dated
from
the
moment
of
bower
public
announcement
of
his
matrimonial
plans
many
of
those
present
were
regretting
a
lost
opportunity
it
was
obvious
to
the
meanest
intelligence
and
the
worn
phrase
took
a
new
vitality
when
applied
to
some
among
the
company
that
any
kindness
shown
to
helen
during
the
preceding
fortnight
would
be
repaid
a
hundredfold
when
she
became
mark
bower
again
not
even
the
bitterest
of
her
critics
could
allege
that
she
was
flirting
with
the
quiet
mannered
american
who
had
just
carried
her
off
like
a
new
paris
she
had
lived
in
the
same
hotel
for
a
whole
week
without
speaking
a
word
to
him
if
anything
she
had
shown
favor
only
to
bower
and
that
in
a
way
so
decorous
and
discreet
that
more
than
one
woman
there
was
amazed
by
her
careless
handling
of
a
promising
situation
just
give
one
of
them
the
chance
of
securing
such
a
prize
fish
as
this
stalwart
millionaire
well
at
least
he
should
not
miss
the
hook
for
lack
of
a
bait
oddly
enough
the
rev
philip
hare
gave
voice
to
a
general
sentiment
when
he
interfered
in
the
duel
he
like
others
was
waiting
for
his
letters
he
saw
helen
come
in
and
was
hurrying
to
offer
his
congratulations
on
her
escape
from
the
storm
when
the
appearance
of
millicent
prevented
him
from
speaking
at
once
the
little
man
was
hot
with
vexation
at
the
scene
that
followed
he
liked
helen
he
was
unutterably
shocked
by
millicent
attack
and
he
resented
the
unfair
and
untrue
construction
that
must
be
placed
on
her
latest
innuendo
as
one
who
has
made
miss
wynton
acquaintance
in
this
hotel
he
broke
in
vehemently
i
must
protest
most
emphatically
against
the
outrageous
statement
we
have
just
heard
if
i
may
say
it
it
is
unworthy
of
the
lady
who
is
responsible
for
it
i
know
nothing
of
your
quarrel
nor
do
i
wish
to
figure
in
it
but
i
do
declare
on
my
honor
as
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
that
miss
wynton
conduct
in
maloja
has
in
no
way
lent
itself
to
the
inference
one
is
compelled
to
draw
from
the
words
used
thank
you
hare
said
bower
quietly
and
a
subdued
murmur
of
applause
buzzed
through
the
gathering
there
is
a
legend
in
zermatt
that
saint
theodule
patron
of
the
valais
wishing
to
reach
rome
in
a
hurry
sought
demoniac
aid
to
surmount
the
impassable
barrier
of
the
alps
opening
his
window
he
saw
three
devils
dancing
merrily
on
the
housetops
he
called
them
which
of
you
is
the
speediest
he
asked
i
said
one
i
am
swift
as
the
bah
cried
the
second
i
can
fly
like
a
bullet
these
two
talk
idly
said
the
third
i
am
quick
as
the
thought
of
a
woman
the
worthy
prelate
chose
the
third
the
hour
being
late
he
bargained
that
he
should
be
carried
to
rome
and
back
before
cockcrow
the
price
for
the
service
to
be
his
saintly
soul
the
imp
flew
well
and
returned
to
the
valley
of
the
rhone
long
ere
dawn
joyous
at
his
gain
he
was
about
to
bound
over
the
wall
of
the
episcopal
city
of
sion
when
theodule
roared
lustily
chante
que
tu
chantes
ou
que
jamais
plus
tu
ne
chantes
every
cock
in
sion
awoke
at
his
voice
and
raised
such
a
din
that
the
devil
dropped
a
bell
given
to
his
saintship
by
the
holy
father
and
saint
theodule
was
snug
and
safe
inside
it
the
prelate
was
right
in
his
choice

struggling
back
to
consciousness
when

the
kindly
women
who
were
loosening
her
bodice
and
chafing
her
hands
and
feet
the
first
words
the
girl
heard
were
in
english
a
woman
voice
was
saying
cheerfully
there
my
dear
a
simple
formula
of
marvelous
recuperative
effect
there
now
you
are
all
right
again
but
your
room
is
bitterly
cold
wo
you
come
into
mine
it
is
quite
near
and
my
stove
has
been
alight
all
day

opening
her
eyes
found
herself
gazing
up
at

high
among
good
deeds
the
girl
lips
quivered
returning
life
brought
with
it
tears
the
woman
whom
she
had
regarded
as
a
social
butterfly
sat
beside
her
on
the
bed
and
placed
a
friendly
arm
round
her
neck
do
cry
you
dear
thing
she
cooed
gently
there
is
nothing
to
cry
about
you
are
a
bit
overwrought
of
course
but
as
it
happens
you
have
scored
heavily
off
all
of
us
and
not
least
off
the
creature
who
upset
you
now
do
try
and
come
with
me
here
are
your
slippers
the
corridor
is
empty
it
is
only
a
few
steps
come
with
you
yes
you
are
shivering
with
the
cold
and
my
room
is
gloriously
warm
but
there
are
no
buts
marie
will
bring
a
basin
of
nice
hot
soup
while
you
are
drinking
it
she
will
set
your

going
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
the
whole
world
is
topsyturvy
and
you
do
think
there
is
a
smile
in
your
as
that
dear
american
man
who
carried
you
here
would
say
helen
recovered
her
senses
with
exceeding
rapidity
de

was
already
leading
her
to
the
door
what
spencer
did
he
he
did
come
now
i
shall
tell
you
all
the
trying
details
when
you
are
seated
in
my
easy
chair
and
wrapped
in
the
duckiest
shetland
shawl
that
a
red
headed
laird
sent
me
last
christmas
excellent
of
course
you
can
walk
is
every
other
woman
in
the
hotel
well
aware
how
you
got
that
lovely
figure
yes
in
that
chair
and
here
is
the
shawl
it
just
like
being
cuddled
by
a
woolly
lamb
de

turned
the
keys
in
two
doors
reggie
always
knocks
she
explained
but
some
inquisitive
cat
may
follow
me
here
and
i
am
sure
you
do
wish
to
be
gushed
over
now
after
everybody
has
been
so
horrid
to
you
you
were
not
said
helen
gratefully
yes
i
was
in
a
way
i
hate
most
women
but
i
admired
you
ever
since
you
took
the
conceit
out
of
that
giddy
husband
of
mine
if
i
speak
it
arose
from
sheer
laziness
a
sort
of
drifting
with
the
stream
in
tow
of
the
general
and
that
old
mischief
maker
vavasour
i
sorry
and
you
will
be
quite
justified
morning
in
sailing
past
me
and
the
rest
as
though
we
were
beetles
then
helen
laughed
feebly
it
is
true
but
with
a
genuine
mirth
that
chased
away
momentarily
the
evergrowing
memory
of
injustice
why
do
you
mention
beetles
she
asked
it
is
part
of
my
every
day
work
to
classify
them
de
la
vere
was
puzzled
i
believe
you
have
said
something
very
cutting
she
cried
if
you
did
we
deserve
it
but
please
tell
me
the
joke
i
shall
hand
it
on
to
the
wraggs
there
is
no
joke
i
act
as
secretary
to
a
german
professor
of
entomology
insects
you
know
he
makes
beetles
a
specialty
the
other
woman
eye
danced
it
is
all
very
funny
she
said
and
i
still
have
my
doubts
never
mind
i
want
to
atone
for
earlier
shortcomings
i
felt
that
someone
really
ought
to
tell
you
what
took
place
in
the
outer
foyer
after
you
sank
gracefully
out
of
the
act
bower
a
tap
on
the
door
leading
into
the
corridor
interrupted
her
it
was
marie
armed
with
chicken
broth
and
dry
toast
de
la
vere
who
seemed
to
be
filled
with
an
honest
anxiety
to
place
helen
at
her
ease
persuaded
her
to
begin
sipping
the
compound
well
what
did
bower
do
demanded
helen
who
was
wondering
now
why
she
had
fainted
the
accusation
brought
against
her
by
millicent
jaques
was
untrue
why
should
it
disturb
her
so
gravely
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
the
true
cause
was
physical
a
too
sudden
change
of
temperature
he
sat
on
that
young
woman
from
the
wellington
theater
very
severely
i
assure
you
from
her
manner
we
all
imagined
she
had
some
sort
of
claim
on
him
but
if
she
was
laboring
under
any
such
delusion
he
cured
her
he
said
are
you
really
strong
enough
to
stand
a
shock
twenty
shocks
i
ca
think
how
i
could
have
been
so
silly
nerves
my
dear
we
all
have
sometimes
if
i
did
smoke
i
should
scream
no
woman
really
likes
to
see
her
husband
flirting
openly
with
her
friends
i
no
saint
but
my
wickedness
is
defensive
now
are
you
ready
quite
ready
bower
told
us
le
you
know
that
he
meant
to
marry
you
oh
said
helen
during
an
appreciable
pause
neither
woman
spoke
helen
was
not
sure
whether
she
wanted
to
laugh
or
be
angry
de
la
vere
eyed
her
curiously
the
girl
face
was
yet
white
and
drawn
it
was
impossible
to
guess
how
the
great
news
affected
her
the
de
la
veres
were
poor
on
two
thousand
a
year
what
did
it
feel
like
to
be
the
prospective
bride
of
a
millionaire
especially
when
you
were
what
was
it
secretary
to
a
man
who
collected
beetles
did
bower
assign
any
reason
for
making
that
remarkable
statement
said
helen
at
last
he
explained
that
the
fact
i
suppose
it
is
a
fact
would
safeguard
you
from
the
malice
of
an
indeed
he
put
it
more
brutally
he
spoke
of
the
malice
of
an
girl
the
english
term
sounds
a
trifle
harsher
than
the
french
do
you
think
it
began
to
dawn
on
helen
that
de
la
vere
friendliness
might
have
a
somewhat
sordid
foundation
was
she
tending
her
merely
to
secure
the
freshest
details
of
an
affair
that
must
be
causing
many
tongues
to
wag
i
am
acquiring
new
theories
of
life
since
i
came
to
maloja
she
said
slowly
one
would
have
thought
that
i
might
be
the
first
person
to
be
made
aware
of
bower
intentions
oh
this
is
really
too
funny
may
i
light
a
cigarette
please
do
and
now
it
is
my
turn
to
ask
you
to
point
out
the
exquisite
humor
of
the
situation
do
be
vexed
with
me
child
you
need
say
another
word
if
you
do
wish
it
but
surely
you
are
not
annoyed
because
i
have
given
you
the
tip
as
to
what
took
place
in
the
hall
you
have
been
exceedingly
good
no
i
have
i
was
just
as
nasty
as
the
others
and
i
sneered
like
the
rest
when
bower
showed
up
a
fortnight
since
i
was
wrong
and
i
apologize
for
it
regard
me
as
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
but
my
heart
went
out
to
you
when
you
dropped
like
a
log
among
all
those
staring
people
i
i
done
it
myself
and
my
case
was
worse
than
yours
once
in
my
life
i
loved
a
man
and
i
came
home
one
day
from
the
hunting
field
to
read
a
telegram
from
the
war
office
he
was
it
said
missing
in
a
action
in
tirah
do
you
know
what
that
means
a
cloud
of
smoke
hid
her
face
but
it
could
not
stifle
the
sob
in
her
voice
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
are
you
there
edith
demanded
reginald
de
la
vere
yes
go
away
i
busy
but
go
away
i
tell
you
then
she
jerked
a
scornful
hand
toward
the
door
six
months
later
i
was
married
men
who
are
missed
among
the
afridis
do
come
back
she
said
i
more
sorry
than
i
can
put
into
words
murmured
helen
for
goodness
sake
do
let
us
grow
sentimental
shall
we
return
to
our
sheep
do
be
afraid
that
i
shall
pasture
the
goats
in
the
hall
on
your
confidences
has
bower
asked
you
no
then
his
action
was
all
the
more
generous
he
meant
to
squelch
that
friend
of
yours
is
she
your
friend
she
used
to
be
said
helen
sadly
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
it
you
will
marry
bower
of
course
helen
heart
fluttered
her
color
rose
in
a
sudden
wave
i
i
think
so
she
breathed
do
you
well
i
like
you
the
better
for
saying
so
i
can
picture
myself
putting
the
same
questions
to
one
of
the
wragg
girls
to
both
of
in
fact
i
am
older
than
you
and
very
much
wiser
in
some
of
the
world
ways
and
my
advice
is
do
marry
any
man
unless
you
are
sure
you
love
him
if
you
do
love
him
you
may
keep
him
for
men
are
patient
creatures
but
that
is
for
you
to
decide
i
ca
help
you
there
i
am
mainly
concerned
for
the
moment
in
helping
you
over
the
ice
during
the
next
day
or
two
if
you
will
let
me
that
is
probably
you
have
determined
not
to
appear
in
public
that
will
be
a
mistake
wear
your
prettiest
frock
and
dine
with
reggie
and
me
we
shall
invite
bower
to
join
us
and
two
other
people
some
man
and
woman
i
can
depend
on
to
keep
things
going
if
we
laugh
and
kick
up
no
end
of
a
noise
it
will
not
only
worry
the
remainder
of
the
crowd
but
you
score
heavily
off
the
theatrical
lady
see
i
can
see
that
you
are
acting
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
cried
helen
oh
dear
no
nothing
so
antiquated
look
at
your
future
position
the
avowed
wife
of
a
millionaire
eh
what
as
georgie
says
but
i
am
not
anything
of
the
kind
bower
bower
is
all
right
he
has
the
recognized
history
of
the
man
who
makes
a
good
husband
and
you
ca
help
liking
him
unless
unless
there
is
another
man
there
at
least
i
am
helen
hesitated
something
gripped
her
heart
and
checked
the
modest
protestation
of
her
freedom
de
la
vere
laughed
if
you
are
not
sure
you
are
safe
she
said
with
a
hard
ring
in
her
utterance
that
belied
her
easygoing
philosophy
really
you
bring
me
back
a
lost
decade
now
helen
may
i
call
you
helen
yes
indeed
well
then
do
forget
that
my
name
is
edith
you
have
just
half
an
hour
to
dress
i
need
every
second
of
the
time
so
off
you
run
to
your
room
as
i
hear
reggie
flinging
his
boots
around
next
door
i
shall
hurry
him
and
arrange
about
the
table
call
for
me
we
must
go
to
the
foyer
together
now
kiss
me
there
a
dear
helen
was
wrestling
with
her
refractory
tresses
for
the
coiffure
that
suits
glaciers
and
tam
is
not
permissible
in
evening
dress
when
a
servant
brought
her
a
note
dear
miss
wynton
it
ran
if
you
are
able
to
come
down
to
dinner
why
not
dine
with
me
sincerely
charles
k
spencer
she
blushed
and
laughed
a
little
i
am
in
demand
she
thought
flashing
a
pardonable
glance
at
her
own
face
in
the
mirror
she
read
the
brief
invitation
again
spencer
had
a
trick
of
printing
the
k
in
his
signature
it
caught
her
fancy
it
suggested
strength
trustworthiness
she
did
not
know
then
that
one
of
the
shrewdest
scoundrels
in
the
western
states
had
already
commented
on
certain
qualities
betokened
by
that
letter
in
spencer
name
i
can
not
refuse
she
murmured
to
be
candid
i
do
want
to
refuse
what
shall
i
do
bidding
the
servant
wait
she
twisted
her
hair
into
a
coil
threw
a
wrap
round
her
shoulders
and
tapped
on
de
la
vere
door
cried
that
lady
i
am
in
a
bit
of
difficulty
said
helen
spencer
wishes
me
to
dine
with
him
would
you
certainly
i
ask
him
to
join
us
reggie
will
see
him
too
really
helen
this
is
amusing
i
am
beginning
to
suspect
you
so
spencer
received
a
surprising
answer
he
read
it
without
any
sign
of
the
amusement
de
la
vere
extracted
from
the
situation
for
helen
took
care
to
recite
the
whole
arrangement
i
going
through
with
this
he
growled
savagely
even
if
i
have
to
drink
bower
health
damn
him
chapter

the
allies
seldom
if
ever
has
a
more
strangely
assorted
party
met
at
dinner
than
that
which
gathered
in
the
hotel
kursaal
under
the
social
wing
of
de
la
vere
her
husband
while
being
coached
in
essentials
was
the
first
to
discover
its
incongruities
where
miss
wynton
is
concerned
you
are
warned
off
his
wife
told
him
dryly
you
must
console
yourself
with
she
will
stand
anything
to
cut
out
a
younger
and
prettier
woman
where
do
you
come
in
edie
said
he
for
de
la
vere
delicate
aristocratic
beauty
seemed
to
be
the
natural
complement
of
her
sporting
style
and
there
was
a
wistful
charm
in
her
face
that
the
lively
reginald
had
not
seen
there
before
she
turned
aside
busying
herself
with
her
toilet
i
do
come
in
i
went
out
five
years
ago
she
cried
with
a
mocking
laugh
do
you
know
he
muttered
i
often
wonder
why
the
deuce
you
an
i
got
married
because
sweet
reginald
we
were
made
for
each
other
by
a
wise
providence
what
other
woman
of
your
acquaintance
would
tolerate
you
as
a
husband
oh
dash
it
all
if
it
comes
to
that
for
goodness
sake
do
fuss
or
begin
to
think
run
away
and
interview
the
head
waiter
then
you
are
to
buttonhole
bower
and
the
american
i
am
just
sending
a
chit
to
the
who
is
my
partner
lulu
of
course
de
la
vere
was
puzzled
and
looked
it
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
he
growled
still
i
ca
help
thinking
you
got
something
up
your
sleeve
edie
she
stamped
a
very
pretty
foot
angrily
do
as
i
tell
you
you
hear
what
bower
said
he
will
be
everlastingly
obliged
to
us
for
coming
to
the
rescue
in
this
fashion
next
time
you
have
a
flutter
in
the
city
his
friendship
may
be
useful
by
gad
cried
reginald
beginning
as
he
fancied
to
see
light
something
seems
to
have
bitten
you
this
evening
tell
you
what
lulu
is
a
get
bower
to
put
you
on
to
a
soft
thing
in
africans
an
you
an
i
will
have
a
second
honeymoon
in
madeira
next
winter
honor
bright
i
mean
it
she
seized
a
silver
mounted
brush
from
the
dressing
table
with
the
obvious
intent
of
speeding
his
departure
he
dodged
out
and
strolled
down
the
corridor
never
saw
edie
in
that
sort
of
tantrum
before
he
said
to
himself
if
she
only
knew
how
sick
i
was
of
all
this
jolly
rot
run
better
in
double
harness
so
it
came
to
pass
when
the
company
assembled
in
the
great
dining
room
that
bower
sat
on
de
la
vere
left
and
spencer
on
her
right
beyond
them
respectively
were
lulu
and
her
husband
and
between
these
latter
were
de
la
vere
and
helen
thus
the
girl
was
separated
from
the
two
men
whom
her
shrewd
eyed
hostess
had
classed
as
rivals
while
the
round
table
made
possible
a
general
conversation
the
talk
could
hardly
fail
to
turn
on
the
day
adventures
spencer
who
had
never
before
in
his
life
thrust
himself
forward
in
a
social
gathering
did
so
now
with
fixed
purpose
he
meant
to
eclipse
bower
in
a
territory
where
that
polished
man
of
the
world
was
accustomed
to
reign
unchallenged
but
he
had
the
wisdom
to
wait
he
guessed
not
without
good
cause
that
more
than
one
late
arrival
would
pause
beside
their
table
and
make
polite
inquiries
as
to
the
climbers
well
being
these
interruptions
were
fatal
to
bower
well
balanced
periods
the
journey
to
the
hut
therefore
was
dealt
with
jerkily
when
spencer
took
up
the
thread
he
caught
and
held
the
attention
of
his
hearers
in
this
he
was
helped
considerably
by
his
quaint
idioms
to
english
ears
american
expressions
are
always
amusing
spencer
of
course
could
speak
quite
as
correct
english
as
anyone
present
but
he
realized
that
in
this
instance
a
certain
amount
of
picturesque
exaggeration
would
lend
itself
to
humor
his
quick
ear
too
had
missed
none
of
the
queer
mixture
of
prayers
and
objurgations
with
which
karl
and
the
two
guides
hailed
every
incident
his
selections
set
them
all
in
a
roar
in
fact
they
were
the
liveliest
party
in
the
room
many
an
eye
was
drawn
by
a
merriment
that
offered
such
striking
contrast
to
the
dramatic
episode
in
the
outer
hall
the
one
person
missing
from
that
crowd
is
the
stage
lady
was
miss
gladys
wragg
caustic
comment
when
evoked
a
fresh
outburst
by
protesting
that
he
forgot
to
eat
his
fish
owing
to
spencer
beastly
funny
yarn
and
miss
wragg
criticism
was
justified
it
only
needed
presence
to
add
a
wizard
touch
to
the
amazement
with
which
vavasour
and
others
of
her
kind
regarded
the
defection
of
the
de
la
veres
and
the
but
millicent
was
dining
in
her
own
room
the
last
thing
she
dreamed
of
was
that
helen
would
face
the
other
residents
in
the
hotel
after
the
ordeal
she
had
gone
through
an
hour
earlier
she
half
expected
that
bower
would
endeavor
to
meet
her
privately
while
dinner
was
being
served
she
was
ready
for
him
she
prepared
a
number
of
sarcastic
little
speeches
each
with
a
subtle
venom
of
its
own
and
even
rehearsed
a
pose
or
two
with
a
view
toward
scenic
effect
but
she
had
neither
taken
bower
measure
nor
counted
on
de
la
vere
superior
strategy
all
that
happened
was
that
she
ate
a
lukewarm
meal
and
was
left
to
wonder
at
her
boldness
in
accepting
a
situation
that
many
a
daring
man
would
have
striven
to
evade
after
dinner
it
was
the
custom
of
the
habitués
to
break
up
into
small
groups
and
arrange
the
night
amusement
dancing
claimed
the
younger
element
while
card
games
had
their
devotees
de
la
vere
danced
invariably
but
she
devoted
herself
to
helen
she
was
under
no
illusions
bower
and
spencer
were
engaged
in
a
quiet
duel
and
the
victor
meant
to
monopolize
the
girl
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
that
was
preventable
they
could
fight
their
battle
on
some
other
occasion
at
present
there
was
one
thing
of
vital
importance
the
unpleasant
impression
created
by
the
actress
bitter
attack
must
be
dissipated
and
de
la
vere
secretly
marveling
at
her
own
enthusiasm
aimed
at
the
achievement
do
be
drawn
away
from
me
on
any
pretext
she
whispered
linking
her
arm
through
helen
as
they
passed
out
into
the
foyer
and
be
gracious
to
everybody
even
to
those
who
have
been
most
cattish
helen
was
far
too
excited
and
grateful
to
harbor
animosity
moreover
she
dreaded
the
chance
of
being
left
alone
with
bower
as
he
had
already
declared
his
intentions
publicly
she
was
sure
he
would
seize
the
first
opportunity
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
and
what
would
be
her
answer
she
hardly
knew
she
must
have
time
to
think
she
must
search
her
own
heart
she
almost
flinched
from
the
succeeding
thought
was
it
that
her
soul
had
found
another
mate
if
that
was
so
she
must
refuse
bower
though
the
man
she
was
learning
to
love
might
pass
out
of
her
life
and
leave
her
desolate
she
liked
bower
even
respected
him
never
for
an
instant
had
the
notion
intruded
that
he
had
followed
her
to
switzerland
with
an
unworthy
motive
to
her
mind
nothing
could
be
more
straightforward
than
their
acquaintance
the
more
she
reflected
on
millicent
extraordinary
conduct
the
more
she
was
astounded
by
its
utter
baselessness
and
bower
was
admirable
in
many
ways
he
stood
high
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
he
was
rich
cultured
and
seemingly
very
deeply
enamored
of
her
undeserving
self
what
better
husband
could
any
girl
desire
he
would
give
her
everything
that
made
life
worth
living
indeed
if
the
truth
must
be
told
she
was
phenomenally
lucky
thus
did
she
strive
to
silence
misgivings
to
quell
doubt
to
order
and
regulate
a
blurred
medley
of
subconscious
thought
while
laughing
and
talking
and
making
the
most
successful
efforts
to
be
at
ease
with
the
dozens
of
people
who
came
and
spoke
to
de
la
vere
and
herself
she
felt
like
some
frail
vessel
dancing
blithely
in
a
swift
smooth
current
yet
hastening
ever
to
the
verge
of
a
cataract
once
bower
approached
skillfully
piloting
for
reginald
tiring
of
the
rôle
thrust
on
him
by
his
wife
had
gone
to
play
bridge
it
was
his
clear
intent
to
take
helen
from
her
chaperon
it
is
still
snowing
though
not
so
heavily
he
said
come
on
the
veranda
and
look
at
the
landscape
the
lake
is
a
pool
of
ink
in
the
middle
of
a
white
table
cloth
the
snow
will
be
far
more
visible
in
the
morning
and
we
have
a
lot
of
ice
to
melt
here
interposed
de
la
vere
quickly
the
man
and
woman
both
well
versed
in
the
ways
of
society
looked
each
other
squarely
in
the
eye
though
disappointed
the
man
understood
was
even
appreciative
miss
wynton
is
fortunate
in
her
friends
he
said
and
straightway
went
to
the
writing
room
he
felt
that
helen
was
safe
with
this
unexpected
ally
he
could
afford
to
bide
his
time
nothing
could
now
undo
the
effect
of
his
open
declaration
while
flouting
millicent
jaques
if
he
gave
that
wayward
young
person
a
passing
thought
it
was
one
of
gladness
that
she
had
precipitated
matters
there
remained
only
an
unpleasant
meeting
with
stampa
in
the
morning
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
that
he
had
nearly
done
a
foolish
thing
while
crossing
the
crevasse
what
sinister
influence
could
have
so
weakened
his
nerve
as
to
make
him
think
of
murder
crime
was
the
last
resource
of
impaired
intellect
he
was
able
to
laugh
now
at
the
stupid
memory
of
it
true
the
american
by
the
way
what
did
millicent
mean
by
her
shrewish
cry
that
spencer
was
paying
for
helen
holiday
so
engrossed
was
he
in
other
directions
that
his
early
doubts
with
regard
to
the
firefly
unprecedented
enterprise
in
sending
a
representative
to
this
swiss
valley
had
been
lulled
to
sleep
of
course
he
had
caused
certain
inquiries
to
be
made
that
was
his
method
one
of
the
telegrams
he
dispatched
from
zurich
after
helen
train
bustled
off
to
coire
started
the
investigation
thus
far
a
trusted
clerk
could
only
ascertain
that
the
newspaper
had
undoubtedly
commissioned
the
girl
on
the
lines
indicated
still
the
point
demanded
attention
he
resolved
to
telegraph
further
instructions
in
the
morning
with
spencer
name
added
as
a
clew
though
to
be
sure
he
was
not
done
with
millicent
yet
he
would
reckon
with
her
also
on
the
morrow
perhaps
if
he
annoyed
her
sufficiently
she
might
explain
that
cryptic
taunt
could
he
have
seen
a
letter
that
was
brought
to
spencer
room
before
dinner
the
telegram
would
not
have
been
written
mackenzie
rather
incoherent
with
indignation
sent
a
hurried
scrawl
dear
spencer
it
ran
a
devil
of
a
thing
has
happened
the
date
being
three
days
old
i
went
out
to
lunch
leaving
a
thick
headed
subeditor
in
charge
i
had
not
been
gone
ten
minutes
when
a
stage
fairy
all
frills
and
flounces
whisked
into
the
office
and
asked
for
miss
wynton
address
my
assistant
succumbed
instantly
he
was
nearly
asphyxiated
with
joy
at
being
permitted
to
entertain
not
unawares
that
angel
of
musical
comedy
miss
millicent
jaques
his
maundering
excuse
is
that
you
yourself
seemed
to
acknowledge
miss
jaques
right
to
be
acquainted
with
her
friend
whereabouts
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
frail
youth
not
only
spoke
of
maloja
but
supplied
such
details
as
were
known
to
him
of
your
kindness
in
the
matter
i
have
cursed
him
extensively
but
that
can
make
no
amends
at
any
rate
i
feel
that
you
should
be
told
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
express
my
lasting
regret
that
the
incident
should
have
occurred
this
letter
joined
to
certain
lurid
statements
made
by
stampa
had
induced
spencer
to
accept
de
la
vere
invitation
little
as
he
cared
to
dine
in
bower
company
it
was
due
to
helen
that
he
should
not
refuse
he
was
entangled
neck
and
heels
in
a
net
of
his
own
contriving
for
very
shame
sake
he
could
not
wriggle
out
leaving
helen
in
the
toils
surely
there
never
was
a
day
more
crammed
with
contrarieties
he
witnessed
his
adversary
rebuff
and
put
it
down
to
its
rightful
cause
no
sooner
had
he
discovered
de
la
vere
apparent
motive
in
keeping
the
girl
by
her
side
than
he
was
buttonholed
by
the
rev
philip
hare
you
know
i
am
not
an
ardent
admirer
of
bower
said
the
cleric
but
i
must
admit
that
it
was
very
manly
of
him
to
make
that
outspoken
statement
about
miss
wynton
what
statement
asked
spencer
ah
i
had
forgotten
you
were
not
present
of
course
he
made
the
other
woman
hysterical
outburst
supremely
ridiculous
by
saying
in
effect
that
he
meant
to
marry
miss
wynton
he
said
that
eh
yes
he
was
quite
emphatic
i
rebuked
miss
jaques
myself
and
he
thanked
me
everything
was
nicely
cut
and
dried
in
my
absence
it
seems
well
er
the
crowd
evidently
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
i
had
carried
off
the
prospective
bride
miss
jaques
called
attention
to
it
guess
her
head
is
screwed
on
straight
she
made
a
bad
break
in
attacking
miss
wynton
but
when
she
set
about
bower
she
was
running
on
a
strong
scent
sit
tight
hare
do
take
sides
or
whoop
up
the
wrong
spout
and
you
see
heaps
of
fun
before
you
much
older
mightily
incensed
the
younger
man
turned
away
the
vicar
produced
his
handkerchief
and
trumpeted
into
it
loudly
god
bless
my
soul
he
said
and
repeated
the
pious
wish
for
he
felt
that
it
did
him
good
how
does
one
whoop
up
the
wrong
spout
and
what
happens
if
one
does
and
how
remarkably
touchy
everybody
seems
to
be
next
time
i
apply
to
the
for
an
alpine
station
i
shall
stipulate
for
a
low
altitude
i
am
sure
this
rarefied
air
is
bad
for
the
nerves
nevertheless
hare
startling
communication
was
the
one
thing
needed
to
clear
away
the
doubts
that
beset
spencer
at
the
dinner
table
he
had
seen
de
la
vere
enter
helen
bedroom
when
he
left
the
girl
in
charge
of
a
gesticulating
maid
but
an
act
of
womanly
solicitude
did
not
explain
the
friendship
that
sprang
so
suddenly
into
existence
now
he
understood
or
thought
he
understood
which
is
a
man
way
when
he
seeks
to
interpret
a
woman
mind
de
la
vere
like
the
rest
was
dazzled
by
bower
wealth
after
ignoring
helen
during
the
past
fortnight
she
was
prepared
to
toady
to
her
instantly
in
her
new
guise
as
the
chosen
bride
of
a
millionaire
the
belief
added
fuel
to
the
fire
already
raging
in
his
breast
there
never
was
man
more
loyal
to
woman
in
his
secret
meditations
than
spencer
but
his
gorge
rose
at
the
sight
of
helen
winsome
gratitude
to
one
so
unworthy
of
it
with
him
now
as
ever
to
think
was
to
act
watching
his
chance
he
waylaid
helen
when
her
vigilant
chaperon
was
momentarily
absorbed
in
a
suggestion
that
private
theatricals
and
the
rehearsal
of
a
minuet
would
relieve
the
general
tedium
while
the
snow
held
spare
me
five
minutes
miss
wynton
he
said
i
want
to
tell
you
something
de
la
vere
pirouetted
round
on
him
before
the
girl
could
answer
miss
wynton
is
just
going
to
bed
she
informed
him
graciously
you
know
how
tired
she
is
spencer
you
must
wait
till
the
morning
i
do
feel
like
waiting
but
i
promise
to
cut
down
my
remarks
to
one
minute
by
the
clock
he
answered
de
la
vere
but
looked
at
helen
her
color
rose
and
fell
almost
with
each
beat
of
her
heart
she
saw
the
steadfast
purpose
in
his
eyes
and
shrank
from
the
decision
she
would
be
called
upon
to
make
hardly
realizing
what
form
the
words
took
she
gave
faint
utterance
to
the
first
lucid
idea
that
presented
itself
i
think
i
must
really
go
to
my
room
she
murmured
you
would
like
me
to
faint
twice
in
one
evening
mr
spencer
it
was
an
astonishing
thing
to
say
the
worst
thing
possible
it
betrayed
an
exact
knowledge
of
his
purpose
in
seeking
this
interview
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
quick
light
it
seemed
that
he
was
answered
before
he
spoke
not
one
second
go
away
do
broke
in
de
la
vere
whisking
helen
toward
the
elevator
without
further
parley
but
she
shot
a
glance
at
spencer
over
her
shoulder
that
he
could
not
fail
to
interpret
as
a
silent
message
of
encouragement
forthwith
he
viewed
her
behavior
from
a
more
favorable
standpoint
guess
the
feminine
is
more
complex
than
i
counted
on
he
communed
as
he
bent
over
a
table
to
find
a
match
that
being
a
commonplace
sort
of
action
calculated
to
disarm
suspicion
lest
others
might
be
observing
him
and
wondering
why
the
women
retired
so
promptly
i
like
your
american
my
dear
said
de
la
vere
sympathetically
in
the
solitude
of
the
corridor
helen
was
silent
if
you
want
to
cry
do
mind
me
went
on
the
kindly
cynic
coming
in
with
you
i
light
up
while
you
weep
and
then
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
that
will
do
you
a
world
of
good
there
to
tell
bleated
helen
oh
yes
there
is
you
silly
child
you
will
have
to
choose
between
those
two
men
which
shall
it
be
i
said
before
dinner
that
i
could
help
you
to
decide
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
anyhow
try
at
midnight
the
snow
storm
ceased
the
wind
died
away
and
the
still
air
deposited
its
vapor
on
hills
and
valley
in
a
hoar
frost
the
sun
rose
with
a
magnificent
disregard
for
yesterday
riot
spencer
room
faced
the
southeast
when
the
valet
drew
his
blind
in
the
morning
the
cold
room
was
filled
with
a
balmy
warmth
a
glance
through
the
window
however
dispelled
a
germ
of
hope
that
helen
and
he
might
start
on
the
promised
walk
to
vicosoprano
the
snow
lay
deep
in
the
pass
and
probably
extended
a
mile
or
two
down
into
the
vale
of
bregaglia
the
rapid
thaw
that
would
set
in
during
the
forenoon
might
clear
the
roads
before
sunset
next
day
walking
would
be
practicable
it
meant
wading
he
looked
through
the
orlegna
gorge
and
caught
the
silvery
sheen
of
the
cima
di
rosso
snow
capped
summit
hardly
a
rock
was
visible
the
gale
had
clothed
each
crag
with
a
white
shroud
all
day
long
the
upper
reaches
of
the
glacier
would
be
pelted
by
avalanches
it
struck
him
that
an
early
stroll
to
the
highest
point
of
the
path
beyond
cavloccio
might
be
rewarded
with
a
distant
view
of
several
falls
in
any
case
it
provided
an
excellent
pretext
for
securing
helen
company
and
he
would
have
cheerfully
suggested
a
trip
in
a
balloon
to
attain
the
same
object
the
temperature
of
his
bath
water
induced
doubts
as
to
the
imminence
of
the
thaw
indeed
the
air
was
bitterly
cold
as
yet
the
snow
lay
closely
on
roads
and
meadow
land
it
had
the
texture
of
fine
powder
passing
traffic
left
shallow
well
defined
marks
a
couple
of
stablemen
swung
their
arms
to
restore
circulation
the
breath
of
horses
and
cattle
showed
in
dense
clouds
for
once
in
his
life
the
color
of
a
tie
and
the
style
of
his
clothes
became
matters
of
serious
import
at
first
he
was
blind
to
the
humor
of
it
he
hesitated
between
the
spruce
tightness
of
a
suit
fashioned
by
a
new
york
tailor
and
the
more
loosely
designed
garments
he
had
purchased
in
london
then
he
laughed
and
reddened
flinging
both
aside
he
chose
the
climber
garb
worn
the
previous
day
and
began
to
dress
hurriedly
therein
he
was
well
advised
nothing
could
better
become
his
athletic
figure
he
was
that
type
of
man
who
looks
thinner
when
fully
clothed
he
had
never
spared
himself
when
asking
others
to
work
hard
and
he
received
his
guerdon
now
in
a
frame
of
iron
and
sinews
of
pliant
steel
helen
usually
came
down
to
breakfast
at
eight
she
had
the
healthy
british
habit
of
beginning
the
day
with
a
good
meal
and
spencer
indulged
in
the
conceit
that
he
might
be
favored
with
a
before
they
started
for
the
projected
walk
neither
bower
nor
de
la
vere
ever
put
in
an
appearance
at
that
hour
though
americans
incline
to
the
continental
manner
of
living
this
true
westerner
found
himself
a
sudden
convert
to
english
methods
in
a
word
he
was
in
love
and
his
lady
could
not
err
to
please
her
he
was
prepared
to
abjure
iced
water
even
to
drink
tea
but
as
often
happens
his
cheery
mood
was
destined
to
end
in
disappointment
he
lingered
a
whole
hour
in
the
à
but
helen
came
not
then
he
rose
in
a
panic
what
if
she
had
breakfasted
in
her
room
and
was
already
basking
in
the
sunlit
veranda
perhaps
listening
to
bower
eloquence
he
rushed
out
so
suddenly
that
his
waiter
was
amazed
really
these
americans
were
incomprehensible
weird
as
the
english
the
two
races
dwelt
far
apart
but
they
moved
in
the
same
erratic
orbit
to
the
stolid
german
mind
they
were
human
comets
whose
comings
and
goings
were
not
to
be
gaged
by
any
reasonable
standard
no
the
veranda
was
empty
to
him
plenty
of
people
greeted
him
but
there
was
no
helen
ultimately
he
reflected
that
their
appointment
was
for
ten
he
calmed
down
and
a
pipe
became
obvious
he
was
enjoying
that
supremest
delight
of
the
smoker
the
first
soothing
whiffs
of
the
day
tobacco
when
a
servant
brought
him
a
note
the
handwriting
was
strange
to
his
eyes
but
a
premonition
told
him
that
it
was
helen
somehow
he
expected
that
she
would
write
in
a
clear
strong
legible
way
he
was
not
mistaken
she
sent
a
friendly
little
message
that
she
was
devoting
the
morning
to
work
the
weather
made
it
impossible
to
go
to
vicosoprano
and
in
any
event
she
did
not
feel
equal
to
a
long
walk
yesterday
events
she
explained
took
more
out
of
me
than
i
imagined
well
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
and
that
counted
he
was
staring
at
the
snow
covered
tennis
courts
and
wondering
how
soon
the
valley
would
regain
its
summer
aspect
when
stampa
limped
into
sight
round
the
corner
of
the
hotel
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
broad
flight
of
steps
as
though
waiting
for
someone
spencer
was
about
to
join
him
for
a
chat
when
he
recollected
that
bower
and
the
guide
had
an
arrangement
to
meet
in
the
morning
with
the
memory
came
a
queer
jumble
of
impressions
stampa
story
told
overnight
was
a
sad
one
but
the
american
was
too
fair
minded
to
affect
a
moral
detestation
of
bower
because
of
a
piece
of
folly
that
wrecked
a
girl
life
sixteen
years
ago
if
the
sins
of
a
man
youth
were
to
shadow
his
whole
life
then
charity
and
regeneration
must
be
cast
out
of
the
scheme
of
things
moreover
bower
version
of
the
incident
might
put
a
new
face
on
it
there
was
no
knowing
how
he
too
had
been
tempted
and
suffered
that
he
raged
against
the
resurrection
of
a
bygone
misdeed
was
shown
by
his
mad
impulse
to
kill
stampa
on
the
glacier
that
such
a
man
strong
in
the
power
of
his
wealth
and
social
position
should
even
dream
of
blotting
out
the
past
by
a
crime
offered
the
clearest
proof
of
the
frenzy
that
possessed
him
as
soon
as
he
recognized
etta
stampa
father
not
one
word
of
his
personal
belief
crossed
spencer
lips
during
the
talk
with
the
guide
rather
did
he
impress
on
his
angry
and
vengeful
hearer
that
a
forgotten
scandal
should
be
left
in
its
tomb
he
took
this
line
not
that
he
posed
as
a
moralist
but
because
he
hated
to
acknowledge
even
to
himself
that
he
was
helped
in
his
wooing
by
helen
horror
of
his
rival
lapse
from
the
standard
every
pure
minded
woman
sets
up
in
her
ideal
lover
ethically
he
might
be
wrong
in
his
conscience
he
was
justified
he
had
suffered
too
grievously
from
every
species
of
intrigue
and
calumny
during
his
own
career
not
to
be
in
regard
to
the
use
of
such
agents
yet
watching
the
bent
and
crippled
old
man
waiting
there
in
the
snow
a
sense
of
pity
and
mourning
chilled
his
heart
with
ice
cold
touch
if
i
were
stampa
son
if
that
dead
girl
were
my
sister
how
would
settle
with
bower
he
asked
clenching
his
pipe
firmly
between
his
teeth
well
i
could
only
ask
god
to
be
merciful
both
to
him
and
to
me
good
gracious
spencer
why
that
fierce
gaze
at
our
delightful
valley
came
the
voice
of
de
la
vere
i
am
glad
none
of
us
can
give
you
the
address
of
the
swiss
clerk
of
the
weather
or
you
would
surely
slay
him
he
turned
convention
demanded
a
smile
and
a
polite
greeting
but
spencer
was
not
conventional
you
are
a
thought
reader
de
la
vere
he
said
of
my
many
attractions
you
should
have
added
i
find
this
limpid
light
too
critical
oh
what
a
horrid
thing
to
tell
any
woman
especially
in
the
early
morning
i
have
a
wretched
habit
of
putting
the
second
part
of
a
sentence
first
i
really
intended
to
say
but
it
is
too
late
it
is
rather
like
swallowing
the
sugar
coating
after
the
pill
but
i
try
well
then
this
crystal
atmosphere
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
obvious
if
we
were
in
london
i
should
catalogue
your
bewitchments
lest
you
imagined
i
was
blind
to
them
that
sounds
nice
but
it
demands
analysis
so
i
have
failed
doubly
i
do
feel
up
to
talking
like
a
character
in
one
of
henry
novels
and
you
were
much
more
amusing
last
night
have
you
seen
miss
jaques
this
morning
no
that
is
i
do
think
so
do
you
know
her
no
it
would
be
a
kind
thing
if
someone
told
her
that
there
are
other
places
in
switzerland
where
she
will
command
the
general
admiration
she
deserves
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
there
is
a
man
in
the
hotel
who
can
put
that
notion
before
her
delicately
spencer
possessed
the
unchanging
gravity
of
expression
that
the
whole
american
race
seems
to
have
borrowed
from
the
red
indian
de
la
vere
eyes
twinkled
as
she
gazed
at
him
you
did
hear
what
was
said
last
night
she
murmured
where
millicent
jaques
is
concerned
delicacy
is
absent
from
is
that
good
new
york
it
would
be
understood
this
time
he
smiled
de
la
vere
wished
to
be
a
friend
to
helen
whatsoever
her
motive
the
wish
was
excellent
you
are
severe
she
pouted
of
course
i
ought
not
to
mimic
you
pray
do
i
had
no
idea
i
spoke
so
nicely
thank
you
but
i
am
serious
i
have
espoused
miss
wynton
cause
and
there
will
be
nothing
but
unhappiness
for
her
while
that
other
girl
remains
here
i
hope
you
are
mistaken
he
said
slowly
meeting
her
quizzing
glance
without
flinching
that
is
precisely
where
a
woman
point
of
view
differs
from
a
man
she
countered
in
our
lives
we
are
swayed
by
things
that
men
despise
we
are
conscious
of
sidelong
looks
and
whisperings
we
dread
the
finger
of
scorn
when
you
have
a
wife
spencer
you
will
begin
to
realize
the
limitations
of
the
feminine
horizon
are
you
asking
me
to
take
this
demonstrative
young
lady
in
hand
i
believe
you
would
succeed
spencer
smiled
again
he
had
not
credited
de
la
vere
with
such
fine
perceptiveness
if
her
words
meant
anything
they
implied
an
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
for
helen
benefit
and
his
own
guess
we
leave
it
right
there
till
i
had
a
few
words
with
miss
wynton
he
said
dropping
suddenly
into
colloquial
phrase
a
heart
to
heart
talk
in
fact
she
laughed
pleasantly
and
opened
her
cigarette
case
tell
you
what
de
la
vere
he
said
if
ever
you
come
to
colorado
i
shall
hail
you
as
a
real
cousin
then
a
silence
fell
between
them
bower
was
walking
out
of
the
hotel
he
passed
close
in
front
of
the
glass
partition
and
might
have
seen
them
if
his
eyes
were
not
as
preoccupied
as
his
mind
but
he
was
looking
at
stampa
and
frowning
in
deep
thought
the
guide
heard
his
slow
heavy
tread
and
turned
the
two
met
they
exchanged
no
word
but
went
away
together
the
lame
peasant
hobbling
along
by
the
side
of
the
tall
well
dressed
plutocrat
how
odd
said
de
la
vere
how
exceedingly
odd
chapter

the
compact
now
what
have
you
to
say
we
are
safe
from
meddlers
here
bower
spoke
curtly
stampa
and
he
were
halfway
across
the
narrow
strip
of
undulating
meadow
land
which
shut
off
the
hotel
from
the
village
they
had
followed
the
footpath
a
busy
thoroughfare
bombarded
with
golf
balls
on
fine
mornings
but
likely
to
be
unfrequented
till
the
snow
melted
receiving
no
answer
bower
glanced
sharply
at
his
companion
but
the
old
guide
might
be
unaware
of
his
presence
so
steadily
did
he
trudge
onward
with
downcast
introspective
eyes
resolved
to
make
an
end
of
a
silence
that
was
irksome
bower
halted
then
for
the
first
time
stampa
opened
his
lips
not
here
he
said
why
not
we
are
alone
you
must
come
with
me
herr
baron
that
is
not
my
title
it
used
to
be
it
will
serve
as
well
as
any
other
i
refuse
to
stir
a
yard
farther
then
said
stampa
i
will
kill
you
where
you
stand
neither
in
voice
nor
feature
did
he
exhibit
any
emotion
he
merely
put
forward
an
reason
and
left
it
at
that
bower
was
no
coward
though
the
curiously
repressed
manner
of
the
threat
sent
a
wave
of
blood
from
his
face
to
his
heart
he
strode
suddenly
nearer
ready
and
eager
to
grapple
with
his
adversary
before
a
weapon
could
be
drawn
he
peered
into
the
peasant
care
lined
face
so
that
is
your
plan
is
it
he
said
thickly
you
would
entice
me
to
some
lonely
place
where
you
can
shoot
or
stab
me
at
your
own
good
pleasure
fool
i
can
overpower
you
instantly
and
have
you
sent
to
a
jail
or
a
lunatic
asylum
for
the
rest
of
your
life
i
carry
no
knife
nor
can
i
use
a
pistol
herr
baron
was
the
unruffled
answer
i
do
not
need
them
my
hands
are
enough
you
are
a
man
a
big
strong
man
with
all
a
man
worst
passions
have
you
never
felt
that
you
could
tear
your
enemy
with
your
nails
choke
him
till
the
bones
of
his
neck
crackled
and
his
tongue
lolled
out
like
a
panting
dog
that
is
how
i
too
may
feel
if
you
deny
my
request
and
i
will
kill
you
marcus
bauer
as
sure
as
god
is
in
heaven
i
will
kill
you
fear
now
lent
its
blind
fury
to
the
instinct
of
self
preservation
bower
leaped
at
stampa
determined
to
master
him
at
the
first
onslaught
but
he
was
heavy
and
slow
inert
after
long
years
of
physical
indolence
the
older
man
awkward
only
because
of
his
crippled
leg
swung
himself
clear
of
bower
grip
and
sprang
out
of
reach
if
there
be
any
who
look
is
you
who
risk
imprisonment
he
said
calmly
with
a
touch
of
humor
that
assuredly
he
did
not
intend
bower
knew
then
how
greatly
he
had
erred
it
was
a
mistake
ever
to
have
agreed
to
meet
stampa
alone
a
much
greater
one
not
to
have
waited
to
be
attacked
as
stampa
said
truly
if
anyone
in
the
village
had
seen
his
mad
action
there
would
be
testimony
that
he
was
the
aggressor
he
frowned
at
stampa
in
a
rage
glowering
at
him
in
a
frenzy
of
impotence
this
dour
old
man
opposed
a
grim
barrier
to
his
hopes
it
was
intolerable
that
he
mark
bower
the
millionaire
a
man
who
held
within
his
grasp
all
that
the
material
world
has
to
give
should
be
standing
there
at
the
mercy
of
a
swiss
peasant
throughout
the
dreary
vigil
of
the
night
he
had
pondered
this
thing
and
could
find
no
loophole
of
escape
the
record
of
that
accursed
summer
sixteen
years
ago
was
long
since
obliterated
in
the
history
of
marcus
bauer
the
emotional
youth
who
made
love
to
a
village
belle
in
zermatt
and
posed
as
an
austrian
baron
among
the
english
and
italians
who
at
that
time
formed
the
select
band
of
climbers
in
the
valais
but
the
romance
was
dead
and
buried
and
its
memory
brought
the
taste
of
dead
sea
ashes
to
the
mouth
marcus
bauer
had
become
a
naturalized
englishman
the
mock
barony
was
replaced
by
a
wealth
that
might
buy
real
titles
but
the
crime
still
lived
and
woe
to
mark
bower
the
financial
magnate
if
it
was
brought
home
to
him
he
had
not
risen
above
his
fellows
without
making
enemies
he
well
knew
the
weakness
and
the
strength
of
the
british
social
system
with
its
strange
complacency
its
allowances
its
hysterical
prudery
its
queer
amalgam
of
puritanism
and
light
hearted
forbearance
he
might
gamble
with
loaded
dice
in
the
city
and
people
would
applaud
him
as
cleverer
and
shrewder
than
his
opponents
his
name
might
be
coupled
with
that
of
a
pretty
actress
and
people
would
only
smile
knowingly
but
let
a
hint
of
his
betrayal
of
etta
stampa
and
its
attendant
circumstances
reach
the
ears
of
those
who
hated
him
and
he
would
sink
forthwith
into
the
slough
of
rich
parvenus
who
eke
out
their
lives
in
vain
efforts
to
enter
the
closely
guarded
circle
from
which
he
had
been
expelled
if
that
was
the
only
danger
he
might
meet
and
vanquish
it
the
unscrupulous
use
of
money
backed
up
by
the
law
of
libel
can
do
a
great
deal
to
still
the
public
conscience
there
was
another
more
subtle
and
heart
searching
he
was
genuinely
in
love
with
helen
wynton
he
had
reached
an
age
when
position
and
power
were
more
gratifying
than
mere
gilded
bohemianism
he
could
enter
parliament
either
by
way
of
palace
yard
or
through
the
portals
of
the
upper
house
he
owned
estates
in
scotland
and
the
home
counties
and
his
park
lane
mansion
figured
already
in
the
address
books
of
half
the
peerage
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
in
placing
a
charming
and
gracious
woman
like
helen
at
the
head
of
his
household
she
would
look
to
him
as
the
lodestar
of
her
existence
and
not
tolerate
him
with
the
hauteur
of
one
of
the
many
aristocratic
young
women
who
were
ready
enough
to
marry
him
but
who
in
their
heart
of
hearts
despised
him
he
had
deliberately
avoided
that
sort
of
matrimonial
blunder
it
promised
more
than
it
fulfilled
he
refused
to
wed
a
woman
who
deemed
her
social
rank
dearly
bartered
for
his
money
yet
before
ever
the
question
arose
he
knew
quite
well
that
this
girl
whom
he
had
chosen
the
poorly
paid
secretary
of
some
harmless
enthusiast
the
strangely
selected
correspondent
of
an
insignificant
journal
would
spurn
him
with
scorn
if
she
heard
the
story
stampa
might
tell
of
his
lost
daughter
that
was
the
wildest
absurdity
in
the
mad
jumble
of
events
which
brought
him
here
face
to
face
with
a
broken
and
frayed
old
man
one
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
the
previous
day
it
was
of
a
piece
with
this
fantasy
that
he
should
be
standing
ankle
deep
in
snow
under
the
brilliant
sun
of
august
and
in
risk
if
not
in
fear
of
his
life
within
two
hundred
yards
of
a
crowded
hotel
and
a
placid
swiss
village
his
usually
well
ordered
brain
rebelled
against
these
manifest
incongruities
his
passion
subsided
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
arisen
he
moistened
his
cold
lips
with
his
tongue
and
the
action
seemed
to
restore
his
power
of
speech
i
suppose
you
have
some
motive
in
bringing
me
here
what
is
it
he
said
you
must
come
to
the
cemetery
it
is
not
far
this
unlooked
for
reply
struck
a
new
note
it
had
such
a
bizarre
effect
that
bower
actually
laughed
then
you
really
are
mad
he
guffawed
harshly
no
not
at
all
i
was
on
the
verge
of
madness
the
other
day
but
i
was
pulled
back
in
time
thanks
to
the
madonna
else
i
might
never
have
met
you
do
you
expect
me
to
walk
quietly
to
the
burial
ground
in
order
that
i
may
be
slaughtered
conveniently
i
am
not
going
to
kill
you
marcus
bauer
said
stampa
i
trust
the
good
god
will
enable
me
to
keep
my
hands
off
you
he
will
punish
you
in
his
own
good
time
you
are
safe
from
me
a
moment
ago
you
spoke
differently
ah
that
was
because
you
refused
to
come
with
me
assuredly
i
shall
bring
either
you
or
your
lying
tongue
to
etta
grave
this
morning
but
you
will
come
now
you
are
afraid
herr
baron
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
and
you
value
that
body
of
yours
too
highly
not
to
do
as
i
demand
believe
me
within
the
next
few
minutes
you
shall
either
kneel
by
my
little
girl
grave
or
tumble
into
your
own
i
am
not
afraid
stampa
i
warn
you
again
that
i
am
more
than
a
match
for
you
yet
i
would
willingly
make
any
reparation
within
my
power
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
yes
yes
that
is
all
i
ask
reparation
such
as
it
is
not
to
me
to
etta
come
then
i
have
no
weapon
i
repeat
you
trust
to
your
size
and
strength
so
by
your
own
showing
you
are
safe
but
you
must
come
a
gleam
of
confidence
crept
into
bower
eyes
was
it
not
wise
to
humor
this
old
madman
perhaps
by
displaying
a
remorse
that
was
not
all
acting
he
might
arrange
a
truce
secure
a
breathing
space
he
would
be
free
to
deal
with
millicent
jaques
he
might
so
contrive
matters
that
helen
should
be
far
removed
from
stampa
dangerous
presence
before
the
threatened
disclosure
was
made
yes
a
wary
prudence
in
speech
and
action
might
accomplish
much
surely
he
dared
match
his
brain
against
a
peasant
very
well
he
said
i
shall
accompany
you
but
remember
at
the
least
sign
of
violence
i
shall
not
only
defend
myself
but
drag
you
off
to
the
communal
guardhouse
without
any
answer
stampa
resumed
his
steady
plodding
through
the
snow
bower
followed
somewhat
in
the
rear
he
glanced
sharply
back
toward
the
hotel
so
far
as
he
could
judge
no
one
had
witnessed
that
frantic
spring
at
his
tormentor
at
that
hour
nearly
every
resident
would
be
on
the
sunlit
veranda
he
wondered
whether
or
not
helen
and
millicent
had
met
again
he
wished
now
he
had
interviewed
millicent
last
night
her
problem
was
simple
enough
a
mere
question
of
terms
spite
had
carried
her
boldly
through
the
scene
in
the
foyer
but
she
was
far
too
sensible
a
young
woman
to
persist
in
a
hopeless
quarrel
it
was
one
of
the
fatalities
that
dogged
his
footsteps
ever
since
he
came
to
maloja
that
the
only
person
watching
him
at
the
moment
should
happen
to
be
millicent
herself
her
room
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
and
she
had
fallen
asleep
after
many
hours
of
restless
thought
when
the
clang
of
a
bell
woke
her
with
a
start
she
found
that
the
morning
was
far
advanced
she
dressed
hurriedly
rather
in
a
panic
lest
her
quarry
might
have
evaded
her
by
an
early
flight
the
fine
panorama
of
the
italian
alps
naturally
attracted
her
eyes
she
was
staring
at
it
idly
when
she
saw
bower
and
stampa
crossing
the
open
space
in
front
of
her
bed
room
window
stampa
of
course
was
unknown
to
her
in
some
indefinable
way
his
presence
chimed
with
her
fear
that
bower
would
leave
maloja
forthwith
did
he
intend
to
post
through
the
vale
of
bregaglia
to
chiavenna
then
indeed
she
might
be
called
on
to
overcome
unforeseen
difficulties
she
appreciated
his
character
to
the
point
of
believing
that
helen
was
his
dupe
she
regretted
now
that
she
was
so
foolish
as
to
attack
her
friend
openly
far
better
have
asked
helen
to
visit
her
privately
and
endeavor
to
find
out
exactly
how
the
land
lay
before
she
encountered
bower
at
any
rate
she
ought
to
learn
without
delay
whether
or
not
he
was
hiring
post
horses
in
the
village
if
so
he
was
unwilling
to
meet
her
and
the
battle
royal
must
take
place
in
london
a
maid
entered
with
coffee
and
rolls
who
is
that
man
with
the
english
monsieur
inquired
millicent
pointing
to
the
two
the
servant
was
a
moritz
girl
and
a
glance
sufficed
that
he
is
christian
stampa
madam
he
used
to
drive
one
of
joos
carriages
but
he
had
a
misfortune
he
nearly
killed
a
lady
whom
he
was
bringing
to
the
hotel
and
was
dismissed
in
consequence
now
he
is
guide
to
an
american
gentleman
my
god
but
they
are
droll
the
americans
the
maid
laughed
and
created
a
clatter
with
basin
and
hot
water
can
millicent
forcing
herself
to
eat
quickly
continued
to
gaze
after
the
pair
the
description
of
stampa
employer
interested
her
his
drollery
evidently
consisted
in
hiring
a
cripple
as
guide
is
the
american
monsieur
named
charles
k
spencer
she
said
speaking
very
clearly
i
do
not
know
madam
but
marie
who
is
on
the
second
can
tell
me
shall
i
ask
do
please
léontine
bustled
out
just
then
millicent
was
amazed
by
extraordinary
leap
at
stampa
and
the
guide
agile
avoidance
of
his
assailant
the
men
faced
each
other
as
though
a
fight
was
imminent
but
the
upshot
was
that
they
walked
on
together
quietly
be
sure
that
two
keen
blue
eyes
watched
their
every
motion
thenceforth
never
leaving
them
till
they
entered
the
village
street
and
disappeared
behind
a
large
chalet
and
what
did
it
all
mean
mark
bower
scuffling
with
a
villager
millicent
smooth
forehead
wrinkled
in
earnest
thought
how
queer
it
would
be
if
bower
was
trying
to
force
spencer
guide
into
the
commission
of
a
crime
he
would
stop
at
nothing
he
believed
he
could
bend
all
men
and
all
women
too
to
his
will
was
he
angered
by
unexpected
resistance
she
hoped
the
maid
would
hurry
with
her
news
though
she
meant
to
go
at
once
to
the
village
it
would
be
a
point
gained
if
she
was
certain
of
stampa
identity
she
was
already
veiled
and
befurred
when
léontine
returned
yes
marie
had
given
her
full
information
madam
had
heard
perhaps
how
herr
bower
and
the
pretty
english
mademoiselle
were
in
danger
of
being
snowed
up
in
the
forno
hut
yesterday
well
stampa
had
gone
with
his
monsieur
spensare
to
their
rescue
and
the
young
lady
was
the
one
whom
stampa
had
endangered
during
his
career
as
a
cab
driver
again
it
was
droll
millicent
agreed
for
the
second
time
she
resolved
to
postpone
her
journey
to
moritz
bower
was
surprised
when
stampa
led
him
into
the
main
road
having
never
seen
any
sign
of
a
cemetery
at
maloja
he
guessed
vaguely
that
it
must
be
situated
close
to
the
church
therein
in
a
sense
he
was
right
it
will
be
remembered
how
helen
solitary
ramble
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
in
maloja
brought
her
to
the
secluded
graveyard
she
first
visited
the
little
swiss
tabernacle
which
had
attracted
her
curiosity
and
thence
took
the
priest
path
to
the
last
resting
place
of
his
flock
but
stampa
had
a
purpose
in
following
a
circuitous
route
he
turned
sharply
round
the
base
of
a
huge
pile
of
logs
stacked
there
in
readiness
for
the
fires
of
a
long
winter
look
he
said
throwing
open
the
half
door
of
a
cattle
shed
behind
the
timber
they
found
her
here
on
the
second
of
august
a
sunday
morning
just
before
the
people
went
to
early
mass
by
her
side
was
a
bottle
labeled
she
bought
it
in
zermatt
on
the
sixth
of
july
so
you
see
my
little
girl
had
been
thinking
a
whole
month
of
killing
herself
poor
child
what
a
month
they
tell
me
herr
baron
you
left
zermatt
on
the
sixth
of
july
bower
face
had
grown
cold
and
gray
while
the
old
man
was
speaking
he
began
to
understand
stampa
would
spare
him
none
of
the
horror
of
the
tragedy
from
which
he
fled
like
a
lost
soul
when
the
news
of
it
reached
the
hotel
well
he
would
not
draw
back
now
if
stampa
and
he
were
destined
to
have
a
settlement
why
defer
it
this
was
his
day
of
reckoning
of
atonement
he
hoped
and
he
would
not
shirk
the
ordeal
though
his
flesh
quivered
and
his
humbled
pride
lashed
him
like
a
whip
the
squalid
stable
was
peculiarly
offensive
owing
to
the
gale
the
cattle
that
ought
to
be
pasturing
in
the
high
alp
were
crowded
there
in
reeking
filth
yesterday
not
long
before
this
hour
he
was
humming
verses
of
cow
songs
to
helen
and
beguiling
the
way
to
the
forno
with
a
recital
of
the
customs
and
idyls
of
the
hills
what
a
spiteful
thing
was
fate
why
had
this
doting
peasant
risen
from
the
dead
to
drag
him
through
the
mire
of
a
past
transgression
if
stampa
betrayed
anger
if
his
eyes
and
voice
showed
the
scorn
and
hatred
of
a
man
justly
incensed
because
of
his
daughter
untimely
death
the
situation
would
be
more
tolerable
but
his
words
were
mild
biting
only
by
reason
of
their
simple
pathos
he
spoke
in
a
detached
manner
he
might
be
relating
the
unhappy
story
of
some
village
maid
of
whom
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
this
complete
self
effacement
grated
on
nerves
it
almost
spurred
him
again
to
ungovernable
rage
but
he
realized
the
paramount
need
of
self
control
he
clenched
his
teeth
in
the
effort
to
bear
his
punishment
without
protest
and
stampa
seemed
to
have
the
gift
of
divination
he
read
heart
by
some
means
he
became
aware
that
the
unsavory
shed
was
loathsome
to
the
fine
gentleman
standing
beside
him
etta
was
always
so
neat
in
her
dress
that
it
must
have
been
a
dreadful
thing
to
see
her
laid
there
he
went
on
she
fell
just
inside
the
door
before
she
drank
the
poison
she
must
have
looked
once
at
the
top
of
old
corvatsch
she
thought
of
me
i
am
sure
for
she
had
my
letter
in
her
pocket
telling
her
that
i
was
at
pontresina
with
my
voyageurs
and
she
would
think
of
you
too
her
lover
her
promised
husband
bower
cleared
his
throat
he
tried
to
frame
a
denial
but
stampa
waved
the
unspoken
thought
aside
surely
you
told
her
you
would
marry
her
herr
baron
he
said
gently
was
it
not
to
implore
you
to
keep
your
vow
that
she
journeyed
all
the
way
from
zermatt
to
the
maloja
she
was
but
a
child
an
innocent
and
frightened
child
and
you
should
not
have
been
so
brutal
when
she
came
to
you
in
the
hotel
ah
well
it
is
all
ended
and
done
with
now
it
is
said
the
madonna
gives
her
most
powerful
aid
to
young
girls
who
seek
from
her
son
the
mercy
they
were
denied
on
earth
and
my
etta
has
been
dead
sixteen
long
years
long
enough
for
her
sin
to
be
cleansed
by
the
fire
of
purgatory
perhaps
when
justice
is
done
to
her
at
last
she
may
be
admitted
to
paradise
who
can
tell
i
would
ask
the
priest
but
he
would
bid
me
not
question
the
ways
of
providence
at
last
bower
found
his
voice
etta
is
at
peace
he
muttered
we
have
suffered
for
our
folly
both
of
us
i
i
could
not
marry
her
it
was
impossible
stampa
did
look
at
him
then
such
a
look
as
the
old
roman
may
have
cast
on
the
man
who
caused
him
to
slay
his
loved
daughter
yet
when
he
spoke
his
words
were
measured
almost
reverent
not
impossible
marcus
bower
nothing
is
impossible
to
god
and
he
ordained
that
you
should
marry
my
etta
i
tell
you
began
bower
huskily
but
the
other
silenced
him
with
a
gesture
they
took
her
to
the
inn
they
are
kind
people
who
live
there
and
someone
telegraphed
to
me
the
news
went
to
zermatt
and
back
to
pontresina
i
was
high
up
in
the
bernina
with
my
party
but
a
friend
found
me
and
i
ran
like
a
madman
over
ice
and
rock
in
the
foolish
belief
that
if
only
i
held
my
little
girl
in
my
arms
i
should
kiss
her
back
to
life
again
i
took
the
line
of
a
bird
if
i
had
crossed
the
muretto
i
should
not
be
lame
but
i
took
corvatsch
in
my
path
and
i
fell
and
when
i
saw
etta
grave
the
grass
was
growing
on
it
come
the
turf
is
sixteen
years
old
now
breaking
off
thus
abruptly
he
swung
away
into
the
open
pasture
bower
heavy
with
wrath
and
care
strode
close
behind
he
strove
to
keep
his
brain
intent
on
the
one
issue
to
placate
this
sorrowing
old
man
to
persuade
him
that
silence
was
best
soon
they
reached
a
path
that
curved
upward
among
stunted
trees
it
ended
at
an
iron
gate
in
the
center
of
a
low
wall
bower
shuddered
this
then
was
the
cemetery
he
had
never
noticed
it
though
in
former
years
he
could
have
drawn
a
map
of
the
maloja
from
memory
so
familiar
was
he
with
every
twist
and
turn
of
mountain
valley
and
lake
the
sun
was
hot
on
that
small
pine
sheltered
hillock
the
snow
was
beginning
to
melt
it
clogged
their
feet
and
left
green
patches
where
their
footprints
would
have
been
clearly
marked
an
hour
earlier
and
they
were
not
the
only
visitors
that
day
there
were
signs
of
one
who
had
climbed
the
hill
since
the
snow
ceased
falling
inside
the
wall
the
white
covering
lay
deep
bower
prominent
eyes
searching
everywhere
with
furtive
horror
saw
that
a
little
space
had
been
cleared
in
one
corner
the
piled
up
snow
was
strewed
with
broken
weeds
and
tufts
of
long
grass
it
bore
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
edges
of
a
grave
he
paused
irresolute
unnerved
yet
desperately
determined
to
fall
in
with
stampa
strange
mood
there
is
nothing
to
fear
said
the
old
man
gently
they
brought
her
here
you
are
not
afraid
you
who
clasped
her
to
your
breast
and
swore
you
loved
her
bower
face
deathly
pale
before
flamed
into
sudden
life
the
strain
was
unbearable
he
could
feel
his
own
heart
beating
violently
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
almost
shouted
she
is
dead
my
repentance
is
of
no
avail
why
are
you
torturing
me
in
this
manner
softly
softly
you
are
disturbed
or
you
would
see
the
hand
of
providence
in
our
meeting
what
could
be
better
arranged
you
have
returned
after
all
these
years
it
is
not
too
late
you
shall
marry

purple
above
the
line
of
his
white
collar
the
veins

out
on
his
temples
he
looked
like
one
in
the
throes
of
apoplexy
for
heaven
sake
what
do
you
mean
he
panted
i
mean
just
what
i

this
is
your
wedding

your

there

never

wait
for
her
man
so

and
patient

be
dealt
with

come
away
let
us
find
some
less
mournful
place
and
i
shall
tell
you
nay
even
yet
you
do
not
understand
well
then
marcus

hear
me
while
you
may
i
swear
you
shall
marry
my
girl
if
i
have
to
recite
the
wedding
prayers
over
your
dead
body
i
have
petitioned
the
madonna
to
spare
me
from
becoming
a
murderer
and
i
give
you
this
last
chance
of
saving
your
dirty
life
kneel
there
by
the
side
of
the
grave
and
attend
to
the
words
that
i
shall
read
to
you
or
you
must
surely
die
you
came
to
zermatt
and
chose
my
etta
very
well
if
it
be
god
will
that
she
should
be
the
wife
of
a
scoundrel
like
you
it
is
not
for
me

resist

you

here
and
now
i
will
bind
you
to

henceforth
and
for
all

and
the
time
will
come
when
her
intercession
may
drag
you
back
from
the
hell
your
cruel
deed
deserves
with
a
mighty
effort
bower
regained
the
that
words
no
less
than
the
depressing
environment
had
shocked
out
of
him
the
grotesque
nature
of
the
proposal
was
a
tonic
in
itself
if
i
had
expected
any
such
folly
on
your
part
i
should
not
have
come
with
you
he
said
speaking
with
something
of
his
habitual
dignity
your
suggestion
is
monstrous
how
can
i
marry
a
dead
woman
stampa
expression
changed
instantly
its
meek
sorrow
yielded
to
a
ferocity
that
was
appalling
already
bent
he
crouched
like
a
wild
beast
gathering
itself
for
an
attack
do
you
refuse
he
asked
in
a
low
note
of
intense
passion
yes
curse
you
and
mutter
your
prayers
in
your
own
behalf
you
need
them
more
than
i
bower
planted
himself
firmly
right
in
the
gateway
he
clenched
his
fists
and
savagely
resolved
to
batter
this
lunatic
face
into
a
pulp
he
had
a
notion
that
stampa
would
rush
straight
at
him
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
strike
from
the
shoulder
hard
and
true
he
was
bitterly
undeceived
the
man
who
was
nearly
twenty
years
his
senior
jumped
from
the
top
of
a
low
monument
on
to
the
flat
coping
stones
of
the
wall
from
that
greater
height
he
leaped
down
on
bower
who
struck
out
wildly
but
without
a
tithe
of
the
force
needed
to
stop
the
impact
of
a
heavily
built
adversary
he
had
to
change
feet
too
and
he
was
borne
to
the
earth
by
that
catamount
spring
before
he
could
avoid
it
for
a
few
seconds
the
two
writhed
in
the
snow
in
deadly
embrace
then
stampa
remained
uppermost
he
had
pinned
bower
to
the
ground
face
downward
kneeling
on
his
shoulders
with
the
left
hand
gripping
his
neck
and
the
right
clutching
his
hair
and
scalp
he
pulled
back
the
wretched
man
head
till
it
was
a
miracle
that
the
spinal
column
was
not
broken
now
he
growled
are
you
content
there
was
no
reply
it
was
a
physical
impossibility
that
bower
should
speak
even
in
his
tempest
of
rage
stampa
realized
this
and
loosened
his
grip
sufficiently
to
give
his
opponent
a
moment
of
precious
breath
answer
he
muttered
again
promise
you
will
obey
you
brute
or
i
crack
your
neck
bower
gurgled
something
that
sounded
like
an
appeal
for
mercy
stampa
rose
at
once
but
took
the
precaution
to
close
the
gate
since
they
had
rolled
into
the
cemetery
during
their
short
fight
he
cried
you
are
not
the
first
who
deemed
me
helpless
because
of
my
crooked
leg
you
might
have
run
from
me
marcus
bauer
you
could
never
fight
me
were
i
at
death
door
i
would
still
have
strength
left
to
throttle
you
if
once
my
fingers
closed
round
your
throat
bower
raised
himself
on
hands
and
knees
he
cut
an
abject
figure
but
he
was
beyond
all
thought
of
appearances
for
one
dread
moment
his
life
had
trembled
in
the
balance
that
glimpse
of
death
and
of
the
gloomy
path
beyond
was
affrighting
he
would
do
anything
now
to
gain
time
wealth
fame
love
itself
what
were
they
each
and
all
when
viewed
from
the
threshold
of
that
barrier
which
admits
a
man
once
and
for
ever
in
deep
laboring
gasps
his
breath
came
back
the
blood
coursed
freely
again
in
his
veins
he
lived
ah
that
was
everything
he
still
lived
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
bare
headed
yellow
skinned
dazed
and
trembling
his
eyes
dwelt
on
stampa
with
a
new
timidity
he
found
difficulty
in
straightening
his
limbs
he
was
quite
insensible
of
his
ridiculous
aspect
his
clothing
even
his
hair
was
matted
with
soft
snow
in
a
curiously
servile
way
he
stooped
to
pick
up
his
cap
stampa
lurched
toward
the
tiny
patch
of
grass
from
which
he
had
cleared
the
snow
soon
after
daybreak
kneel
here
at
her
feet
he
said
bower
approached
with
a
slow
dragging
movement
without
a
word
of
protest
he
sank
to
his
knees
the
snow
in
his
hair
began
to
melt
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
face
as
though
shutting
out
some
horrific
vision
stampa
produced
from
his
pocket
a
frayed
and
tattered
prayer
book
an
italian
edition
of
the
paroissien
romain
he
opened
it
at
a
marked
page
and
began
to
read
the
marriage
ritual
though
the
words
were
latin
and
he
was
no
better
educated
than
any
other
peasant
in
the
district
he
pronounced
the
sonorous
phrases
with
extraordinary
accuracy
of
course
he
was
an
italian
and
latin
was
not
such
an
incomprehensible
tongue
to
him
as
it
would
prove
to
a
german
or
englishman
of
his
class
moreover
the
liturgy
of
the
church
of
rome
is
familiar
to
its
people
no
matter
what
their
race
bower
stupefied
and
benumbed
though
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
and
a
constant
dripping
from
the
pine
branches
gave
proof
of
a
rapid
thaw
listened
like
one
in
a
trance
he
understood
scattered
sentences
brokenly
yet
with
sufficient
comprehension
deo
mumbled
stampa
and
the
bridegroom
in
this
strange
rite
knew
that
he
was
making
the
profession
of
a
faith
he
did
not
share
his
mind
cleared
by
degrees
he
was
still
under
the
spell
of
bodily
fear
but
his
brain
triumphed
over
physical
stress
and
bade
him
disregard
these
worn
out
shibboleths
nevertheless
the
words
had
a
tremendous
significance
noster
qui
es
in
coelis
sanctificetur
nomen
tuum
dimitte
nobis
debita
nostra
sicut
et
nos
dimittimus
debitoribus
nostris
it
was
quite
easy
to
follow
their
general
drift
anyone
who
had
ever
recited
the
lord
prayer
in
any
language
would
realize
that
he
was
asking
the
deity
to
forgive
him
his
trespasses
as
he
forgave
those
who
trespassed
against
him
and
there
came
to
the
kneeling
man
a
thrilling
consciousness
that
stampa
was
appealing
for
him
in
the
name
of
the
dead
girl
the
once
blushing
and
timid
maid
whose
bones
were
crumbling
into
dust
beneath
that
coverlet
of
earth
and
herbage
there
could
be
no
doubting
the
grim
earnestness
of
the
reader
it
mattered
not
a
jot
to
stampa
that
he
was
usurping
the
functions
of
the
church
in
an
outlandish
travesty
of
her
ritual
he
was
sustained
by
a
fixed
belief
that
the
daughter
so
heartlessly
reft
from
him
was
present
in
spirit
nay
more
that
she
was
profoundly
grateful
for
this
belated
sanctifying
of
an
unhallowed
love
bower
feelings
or
convictions
were
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
he
owed
it
to
etta
to
make
reparation
and
the
duty
must
be
fulfilled
to
the
utmost
letter
strong
man
as
he
was
bower
nearly
fainted
he
scarce
had
the
faculty
of
speech
when
stampa
bade
him
make
the
necessary
responses
in
italian
but
he
obeyed
all
the
time
the
devilish
conviction
grew
that
if
he
persisted
in
this
flummery
he
might
emerge
scatheless
from
a
ghastly
ordeal
the
punishment
of
publicity
was
the
one
thing
he
dreaded
and
that
might
be
avoided
for
etta
sake
so
he
obeyed
with
cunning
pretense
of
grief
trying
to
veil
the
malevolence
in
his
heart
at
last
when
the
solemn
omnia
and
a
peaceful
amen
announced
the
close
of
this
amazing
marriage
service
stampa
looked
fixedly
at
his
supposed
now
marcus
bauer
he
said
i
have
done
with
you
see
to
it
that
you
do
not
again
break
your
plighted
vows
to
my
daughter
she
is
your
wife
you
are
her
husband
not
even
death
can
divide
you
go
his
strong
splendidly
molded
face
massive
and
dignified
cast
in
lines
that
would
have
appealed
to
a
sculptor
who
wished
to
limn
the
features
of
a
patriarch
of
old
wore
an
aspect
of
settled
calm
he
was
at
peace
with
all
the
world
he
had
forgiven
his
enemy
bower
rose
again
stiffly
he
would
have
spoken
but
stampa
now
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
pray
silently
so
the
millionaire
humbled
again
and
terror
stricken
by
the
sinister
significance
of
those
concluding
words
yet
not
daring
to
question
them
crept
out
of
the
place
of
the
dead
as
he
staggered
down
the
hillside
he
looked
back
once
he
had
eyes
only
for
the
little
iron
gate
but
stampa
came
not
then
he
essayed
to
brush
some
of
the
clinging
snow
off
his
clothes
he
shook
himself
like
a
dog
after
a
plunge
into
water
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
hotel
with
its
promise
of
luxury
and
forgetfulness
and
he
cursed
stampa
with
a
bitter
fury
of
emphasis
trying
vainly
to
persuade
himself
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
a
maniac
delusion
chapter
xiv
wherein
millicent
arms
for
the
fray
millicent
was
wondering
how
she
would
fare
in
the
deep
snow
in
boots
that
were
never
built
for
such
a
test
she
was
standing
on
the
swept
roadway
between
the
hotel
and
the
stables
and
the
tracks
of
her
quarry
were
plainly
visible
but
the
hope
of
discovering
some
explanation
of
bower
queer
behavior
was
more
powerful
than
her
dread
of
wet
feet
she
was
gathering
her
skirts
daintily
before
taking
the
next
step
when
the
two
men
suddenly
reappeared
they
had
left
the
village
and
were
crossing
the
line
of
the
path
shrinking
back
under
cover
of
an
empty
wagon
she
watched
them
apparently
they
were
heading
for
the
orlegna
gorge
and
she
scanned
the
ground
eagerly
to
learn
how
she
could
manage
to
spy
on
them
without
being
seen
almost
immediately
then
she
fell
into
the
same
error
as
helen
in
believing
that
the
winding
carriage
road
to
the
church
offered
the
nearest
way
to
the
clump
of
firs
and
azaleas
by
which
bower
and
stampa
would
soon
be
hidden
three
minutes
sharp
walking
brought
her
to
the
church
but
there
the
highway
turned
abruptly
toward
the
village
as
one
side
of
the
small
ravine
faced
south
the
sun
rays
were
beginning
to
have
effect
and
a
narrow
track
seemingly
leading
to
the
hill
was
almost
laid
bare
in
any
event
it
must
bring
her
near
the
point
where
the
men
vanished
so
she
went
on
breathlessly
crossing
the
rivulet
already
swollen
with
melting
snow
she
mounted
the
steps
cut
in
the
hillside
it
was
heavy
going
in
that
thin
air
but
she
held
to
it
determinedly
then
she
heard
men
voices
raised
in
anger
she
recognized
one
bower
was
speaking
german
stampa
a
mixture
of
german
and
italian
millicent
had
a
vague
acquaintance
with
both
languages
but
it
was
of
the
ollendorf
order
and
did
not
avail
her
in
understanding
their
rapid
excited
words
soon
there
were
other
sounds
the
animal
cries
the
sobs
the
labored
grunts
of
men
engaged
in
deadly
struggle
thoroughly
alarmed
more
willing
to
retreat
than
advance
she
still
clambered
on
impelled
by
irresistible
desire
to
find
out
what
strange
thing
was
happening
at
last
partly
concealed
by
a
dwarf
fir
she
could
peer
over
a
wall
into
the
tiny
cemetery
she
was
too
late
to
witness
the
actual
fight
but
she
saw
stampa
spring
upright
leaving
his
prostrate
opponent
apparently
lifeless
she
was
utterly
frightened
fear
rendered
her
mute
to
her
startled
eyes
it
seemed
that
bower
had
been
killed
by
the
crippled
man
soon
that
quite
natural
impression
yielded
to
one
of
sustained
astonishment
bower
rose
slowly
a
sorry
spectacle
to
her
woman
mind
unfamiliar
with
scenes
of
violence
it
was
surprising
that
he
did
not
begin
at
once
to
beat
the
life
out
of
the
lame
old
peasant
who
had
attacked
him
so
viciously
when
stampa
closed
the
gate
and
motioned
bower
to
kneel
when
the
tall
powerfully
built
man
knelt
without
protest
when
the
reading
of
the
latin
service
began
well
millicent
could
never
afterward
find
words
to
express
her
conflicting
emotions
but
she
did
not
move
crouching
behind
her
protecting
tree
guarding
her
very
breath
lest
some
involuntary
cry
should
betray
her
presence
she
watched
the
whole
of
the
weird
ceremonial
she
racked
her
brains
to
guess
its
meaning
strained
her
ears
to
catch
a
sentence
that
might
be
identified
hereafter
but
she
failed
in
both
respects
of
course
it
was
evident
that
someone
was
buried
there
someone
whose
memory
the
wild
looking
villager
held
dear
someone
whose
grave
he
had
forced
bower
to
visit
someone
for
whose
sake
he
was
ready
to
murder
bower
if
the
occasion
demanded
so
much
was
clear
but
the
rest
was
blurred
a
medley
of
incoherences
a
waking
nightmare
oddly
enough
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
a
woman
might
be
lying
in
that
dreary
tenement
her
first
vague
imagining
suggested
that
bower
had
committed
a
crime
killed
a
man
and
that
an
avenger
had
dragged
him
to
his
victim
last
resting
place
that
stampa
was
laboriously
plodding
through
the
marriage
ritual
was
a
fantastic
conceit
of
which
she
received
no
hint
there
was
nothing
to
dissolve
the
mist
in
her
mind
she
could
only
wait
and
marvel
as
the
strange
scene
drew
to
its
close
she
became
calmer
she
reflected
that
some
sort
of
registry
would
be
kept
of
the
graves
a
few
dismal
monuments
and
two
rows
of
little
black
wooden
crosses
that
stuck
up
mournfully
out
of
the
snow
gave
proof
positive
of
that
she
counted
the
crosses
stampa
was
standing
near
the
seventh
from
a
tomb
easily
recognizable
at
some
future
time
bower
faced
it
on
his
knees
she
could
not
see
him
distinctly
as
he
was
hidden
by
the
other
broad
shoulders
but
she
did
not
regret
it
because
the
warm
brown
tints
of
her
furs
against
the
background
of
snow
and
foliage
might
warn
him
of
her
presence
she
thanked
the
kindly
stars
that
brought
her
here
no
matter
what
turn
events
took
now
she
hoped
to
hold
the
whip
hand
over
bower
there
was
a
mystery
to
be
cleared
of
course
but
with
such
materials
she
could
hardly
fail
to
discover
its
true
bearings
so
she
watched
in
tremulous
patience
quick
to
note
each
movement
of
the
actors
in
a
drama
the
like
to
which
she
had
never
seen
on
the
stage
at
last
bower
slunk
away
she
heard
the
crunching
of
his
feet
on
the
snow
and
when
stampa
ceased
his
silent
prayer
she
expected
that
he
would
depart
by
the
same
path
to
her
overwhelming
dismay
he
wheeled
round
and
looked
straight
at
her
in
reality
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
hills
behind
her
he
was
thinking
of
his
unhappy
daughter
the
giant
mass
of
corvatsch
was
associated
in
his
mind
with
the
last
glimpse
of
her
beloved
switzerland
while
on
that
same
memorable
day
it
threw
its
deep
shadow
over
his
own
life
he
turned
to
the
mountain
to
seek
its
testimony
as
it
were
to
the
consummation
of
a
tragedy
but
millicent
could
not
know
that
losing
all
command
of
herself
she
shrieked
in
terror
and
ran
wildly
among
the
trees
she
stumbled
and
fell
before
she
had
gone
five
yards
over
the
rough
ground
quite
in
a
panic
confused
and
blinded
with
snow
she
rose
and
ran
again
only
to
find
herself
speeding
back
to
the
burial
ground
then
in
a
very
agony
of
distress
she
stood
still
stampa
was
looking
at
her
with
mild
surprise
displayed
in
every
line
of
his
expressive
features
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
in
italian
she
half
understood
but
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
her
terror
was
manifest
and
he
pitied
her
he
repeated
his
question
in
german
a
child
might
have
recognized
that
this
man
of
the
benignant
face
and
kindly
sorrow
laden
eyes
intended
no
evil
i
am
sorry
i
beg
your
pardon
herr
stampa
she
managed
to
stammer
ah
you
know
me
then
but
everybody
knows
old
stampa
have
you
lost
your
way
i
was
taking
a
little
walk
and
happened
to
approach
the
cemetery
i
saw
there
is
nothing
to
interest
you
here
madam
and
still
less
to
cause
fear
but
it
is
a
sad
place
at
the
best
follow
that
path
it
will
lead
you
to
the
village
or
the
hotel
her
fright
was
subsiding
rapidly
she
deemed
the
opportunity
too
good
to
be
lost
if
she
could
win
his
confidence
what
an
immense
advantage
it
would
be
in
her
struggle
against
bower
summoning
all
her
energies
and
trying
to
remember
some
of
the
german
sentences
learned
in
her
school
days
she
smiled
wistfully
you
are
in
great
trouble
she
murmured
i
suppose
herr
bower
has
injured
you
stampa
glanced
at
her
keenly
he
had
the
experience
of
sixty
years
of
a
busy
life
to
help
him
in
summing
up
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
and
this
beautiful
richly
dressed
woman
did
not
appeal
to
his
simple
nature
as
did
helen
when
she
surprised
his
grief
on
a
morning
not
so
long
ago
moreover
the
elegant
stranger
was
little
better
than
a
spy
for
none
but
a
spy
would
have
wandered
among
the
rocks
and
shrubs
in
such
weather
and
he
was
in
no
mood
to
suffer
her
inquiries
i
am
in
no
trouble
he
said
and
herr
bauer
has
not
injured
me
but
you
fought
she
persisted
i
thought
you
had
killed
him
i
almost
wish
you
had
i
hate
him
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
hate
anyone
i
am
three
times
your
age
so
you
may
or
may
not
regard
my
advice
as
excellent
come
round
by
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
you
will
reach
the
path
without
walking
in
the
deep
snow
good
morning
madam
he
bowed
with
an
ease
that
would
have
proclaimed
his
nationality
if
he
had
not
been
an
italian
mountaineer
in
every
poise
and
gesture
stooping
to
recover
his
alpine
hat
which
was
lying
near
the
cross
at
the
head
of
the
grave
he
passed
out
through
the
gate
before
millicent
was
clear
of
the
wall
he
made
off
with
long
uneven
but
rapid
strides
leaving
her
hot
with
annoyance
that
a
mere
peasant
should
treat
her
so
cavalierly
though
she
did
not
understand
all
he
said
she
grasped
its
purport
but
her
soreness
soon
passed
the
great
fact
remained
that
she
shared
some
secret
with
him
and
bower
a
secret
of
an
importance
she
could
not
yet
measure
she
was
tempted
to
go
inside
the
cemetery
and
might
have
yielded
to
the
impulse
had
not
a
load
of
snow
suddenly
tumbled
off
the
broad
fronds
of
a
pine
the
incident
set
her
heart
beating
furiously
again
how
lonely
was
this
remote
hilltop
even
the
glorious
sunshine
did
not
relieve
its
brooding
silence
thus
it
came
about
that
these
three
people
went
down
into
the
valley
each
within
a
short
distance
of
the
others
and
spencer
saw
them
all
from
the
high
road
where
he
was
questioning
an
official
of
the
federal
postoffice
as
to
the
method
of
booking
seats
in
the
banquette
of
the
diligence
from
vicosoprano
that
he
was
bewildered
by
the
procession
goes
without
saying
where
had
they
been
and
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
the
presence
be
accounted
for
the
polite
postmaster
must
have
thought
that
the
englishman
was
very
dense
that
morning
several
times
he
explained
fully
that
the
two
desired
seats
in
the
diligence
must
be
reserved
from
chiavenna
as
many
times
did
spencer
repeat
the
information
without
in
the
least
seeming
to
comprehend
it
he
spoke
with
the
detached
air
of
a
boy
in
the
first
form
reciting
the
fifth
proposition
in
euclid
at
last
the
postmaster
gave
it
up
in
despair
you
see
that
man
there
he
said
to
a
keenly
interested
policeman
when
spencer
strolled
away
in
the
direction
of
the
village
he
is
of
the
most
peculiar
he
talks
german
like
a
parrot
he
must
be
a
rich
american
perhaps
he
wants
to
buy
a
diligence
weiss
said
the
other
money
makes
some
folk
mad
and
indeed
through
spencer
brain
was
running
a
bedlamite
jingle
a
triolet
of
which
the
dominant
line
was
bower
stampa
and
millicent
jaques
the
meeting
of
bower
and
stampa
was
easy
of
explanation
after
the
guide
story
of
the
previous
evening
nothing
but
stampa
death
or
bower
flight
could
prevent
it
but
the
woman
from
the
wellington
theater
how
had
she
come
to
know
of
their
feud
he
was
almost
tempted
to
quote
the
only
line
of
molière
ever
heard
beyond
the
shores
of
france
like
every
visitor
to
the
maloja
he
was
acquainted
with
each
of
its
roads
and
footpaths
except
the
identical
one
that
these
three
descended
where
did
it
lead
to
before
he
quite
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
was
walking
up
the
hill
in
places
where
the
sun
had
not
yet
caught
the
snow
there
was
a
significant
trail
bower
had
come
and
gone
once
stampa
or
some
man
wearing
boots
twice
but
the
single
track
left
by
millicent
smart
footwear
added
another
perplexing
item
to
the
puzzle
so
he
pressed
on
and
soon
was
gazing
at
the
forlorn
cemetery
with
its
signs
of
a
furious
struggle
between
the
gateposts
the
uncovered
grave
space
and
millicent
track
round
two
corners
of
the
square
built
wall
it
was
part
of
his
life
training
to
read
signs
the
mining
engineer
who
would
hit
on
a
lode
in
a
mountain
of
granite
must
combine
imagination
with
knowledge
and
spencer
quickly
made
out
something
of
the
silent
story
something
not
all
but
enough
to
send
him
in
haste
to
the
hotel
by
the
way
millicent
had
arrived
on
the
scene
guess
there
going
to
be
a
heap
of
trouble
round
here
he
said
to
himself
helen
must
be
recalled
to
london
it
up
to
me
to
make
the
cable
hot
to
mackenzie
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
storm
which
brought
about
a
good
deal
of
the
preceding
hours
excitement
had
not
acted
in
any
niggardly
fashion
it
had
laid
low
whole
sections
of
the
telegraph
system
on
both
sides
of
the
pass
during
the
night
gangs
of
men
were
busy
repairing
the
wires
later
in
the
day
said
a
civil
spoken
attendant
at
the
des
a
notice
would
be
exhibited
stating
the
probable
hour
of
the
resumption
of
service
are
the
wires
down
beyond
st
moritz
asked
spencer
i
can
not
give
an
assurance
said
the
clerk
but
these
southwest
gales
usually
do
not
affect
the
albula
pass
the
road
to
moritz
is
practicable
as
this
morning
mail
was
only
forty
minutes
behind
time
spencer
ordered
a
carriage
wrote
a
telegram
and
gave
it
to
the
driver
with
orders
to
forward
it
from
moritz
if
possible
and
this
was
the
text
mackenzie
office
london
wire
miss
wynton
positive
instructions
to
return
to
england
immediately
say
she
is
wanted
at
office
i
shall
arrange
matters
before
she
arrives
this
is
urgent
spencer
a
heavy
weight
gradually
lifted
off
his
shoulders
as
he
watched
the
wheels
of
the
vehicle
churning
up
the
brown
snow
broth
along
the
valley
road
within
two
hours
his
message
would
reach
a
telegraph
office
two
more
would
bring
it
to
mackenzie
with
reasonable
luck
the
line
repairers
would
link
maloja
to
the
outer
world
that
afternoon
and
helen
would
hie
homeward
in
the
morning
it
was
a
pity
that
her
holiday
and
his
wooing
should
be
interfered
with
but
who
could
have
foretold
that
millicent
jaques
would
drop
from
the
sky
in
that
unheralded
way
her
probable
interference
in
the
quarrel
between
stampa
and
bower
put
de
la
vere
suggestion
out
of
court
a
woman
bent
on
requiting
a
personal
slight
would
never
consent
to
forego
such
a
chance
of
obtaining
ample
vengeance
as
bower
earlier
history
provided
in
any
case
spencer
was
sure
that
the
sooner
helen
and
he
were
removed
from
their
present
environment
the
happier
they
would
be
he
hoped
most
fervently
that
the
course
of
events
might
be
made
smooth
for
their
departure
he
cared
not
a
jot
for
the
of
the
hotel
let
him
but
see
helen
in
london
and
it
would
not
be
his
fault
if
they
did
not
set
forth
on
their
honeymoon
before
the
year
was
much
older
he
disliked
this
secret
plotting
and
contriving
he
adopted
such
methods
only
because
they
offered
the
surest
road
to
success
were
he
to
consult
his
own
feelings
he
would
go
straight
to
helen
tell
her
how
chance
had
conspired
with
vagrom
fancy
to
bring
them
together
and
ask
her
to
believe
as
all
who
love
are
ready
to
believe
that
their
union
was
predestined
throughout
the
ages
but
he
could
not
explain
his
presence
in
switzerland
without
referring
to
bower
and
the
task
was
eminently
distasteful
in
all
things
concerning
the
future
relations
between
helen
and
himself
he
was
done
with
pretense
if
he
could
help
it
her
first
visit
to
the
alps
should
not
have
its
record
darkened
by
the
few
miserable
pages
torn
out
of
bower
life
after
many
years
the
man
sin
had
discovered
him
that
which
was
then
done
in
secret
was
now
about
to
be
shrieked
aloud
from
the
housetops
even
the
gods
can
not
undo
the
past
said
the
old
greeks
and
the
stern
dogma
had
lost
nothing
of
its
truth
with
the
march
of
the
centuries
indeed
spencer
regretted
his
threatened
exposure
if
it
lay
in
his
power
he
would
prevent
it
meanwhile
helen
must
be
snatched
from
the
enduring
knowledge
of
her
innocent
association
with
the
offender
and
his
pillory
he
set
his
mind
on
the
achievement
to
succeed
he
must
monopolize
her
company
until
she
quitted
the
hotel
en
route
for
london
then
he
thought
of
de
la
vere
as
a
helper
her
seeming
shallowness
her
glaring
affectations
no
longer
deceived
him
the
mask
lifted
for
an
instant
by
that
backward
glance
as
she
convoyed
helen
to
her
room
the
previous
night
had
proved
altogether
ineffective
since
their
talk
on
the
veranda
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
himself
why
such
a
woman
volatile
fickle
blown
this
way
and
that
by
social
zephyrs
should
champion
the
cause
of
romance
he
simply
thanked
heaven
for
it
nor
sought
other
explanation
than
was
given
by
his
unwavering
belief
in
the
essential
nobility
of
her
sex
therein
he
was
right
had
he
trusted
to
her
intuition
and
told
millicent
jaques
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
exactly
how
matters
stood
between
helen
and
himself
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
actress
would
have
changed
her
plan
of
campaign
she
had
no
genuine
antipathy
toward
helen
whose
engagement
to
spencer
would
be
her
strongest
weapon
against
bower
as
matters
stood
however
helen
was
a
stumbling
block
in
her
path
and
her
jealous
rage
was
in
process
of
being
fanned
to
a
passionate
intensity
when
spencer
searching
for
de
la
vere
saw
millicent
in
the
midst
of
a
group
composed
of
the
vavasours
mother
and
son
the
general
and
his
daughters
de
courcy
vavasour
was
the
evil
spirit
who
brought
about
this
sinister
gathering
she
was
awed
by
bower
she
would
not
risk
a
snubbing
from
de
la
vere
and
she
was
exceedingly
annoyed
to
think
that
helen
might
yet
topple
her
from
her
throne
to
one
of
her
type
this
final
consideration
was
peculiarly
galling
and
the
too
susceptible
georgie
would
be
quite
safe
with
the
lady
from
the
wellington
theater
vavasour
remembered
the
malice
in
millicent
fine
eyes
when
she
refused
to
quail
before
bower
wrath
a
hawk
in
pursuit
of
a
plump
pigeon
would
not
turn
aside
to
snap
up
an
insignificant
sparrow
so
being
well
versed
in
the
tactics
of
these
social
skirmishes
she
sought
millicent
acquaintance
the
younger
woman
was
ready
to
meet
her
more
than
halfway
the
hotel
gossips
were
the
very
persons
whose
aid
she
needed
a
gracious
smile
and
a
pouting
complaint
against
the
weather
were
the
preliminaries
in
two
minutes
they
were
discussing
helen
and
general
wragg
was
drawn
into
their
chat
georgie
and
the
misses
wragg
of
course
came
uninvited
they
scented
scandal
as
jackals
sniff
the
feast
provided
by
the
mightier
beasts
millicent
really
despising
these
people
but
anxious
to
hear
the
story
of
bower
love
making
made
no
secret
of
her
own
sorrows
miss
wynton
was
my
friend
she
said
with
ingenuous
pathos
she
never
met
bower
until
i
introduced
her
to
him
a
few
days
before
she
came
to
switzerland
you
may
guess
what
a
shock
it
gave
me
when
i
heard
that
he
had
followed
her
here
even
then
knowing
how
strangely
coincidence
works
at
times
i
refused
to
believe
that
the
man
who
was
my
promised
husband
would
abandon
me
under
the
spell
of
a
momentary
infatuation
for
it
can
be
nothing
more
are
you
sure
asked
the
sympathetic
vavasour
by
gad
growled
wragg
i
inclined
to
differ
from
you
there
miss
jaques
when
bower
turned
up
last
week
they
met
as
very
old
friends
i
can
assure
you
obviously
a
prearranged
affair
said
vavasour
none
of
us
has
had
a
look
in
since
grinned
georgie
vacuously
even
reggie
de
la
vere
who
is
a
deuce
of
a
fellah
with
the
girls
could
not
get
within
yards
of
her
this
remark
found
scant
favor
with
his
audience
miss
beryl
wragg
who
had
affected
de
la
vere
company
for
want
of
an
eligible
bachelor
pursed
her
lips
scornfully
i
can
hardly
agree
with
that
she
said
edith
de
la
vere
may
be
a
sport
but
she
does
exactly
fling
her
husband
at
another
head
anyhow
it
was
amazing
bad
form
on
her
part
to
include
miss
wynton
in
her
dinner
party
last
night
millicent
blue
eyes
snapped
did
helen
wynton
dine
in
public
yesterday
evening
she
demanded
rather
quite
a
lively
crowd
they
were
too
indeed
who
were
the
others
oh
the
and
the
bower
man
and
that
american
what
his
name
then
millicent
laughed
shrilly
she
saw
her
chance
of
delivering
a
deadly
stroke
and
took
it
without
mercy
the
american
spencer
what
a
delightful
mixture
why
he
is
the
very
man
who
is
paying
miss
wynton
expenses
so
you
said
last
night
a
somewhat
er
dangerous
statement
coughed
the
general
rather
stiff
you
know
eh
what
put
in
georgie
his
mother
silenced
him
with
a
frosty
glance
of
course
you
have
good
reasons
for
saying
that
she
interposed
spencer
passed
at
that
instant
and
there
was
a
thrilling
pause
millicent
was
well
aware
that
every
ear
was
alert
to
catch
each
syllable
when
she
spoke
her
words
were
clear
and
precise
naturally
one
would
not
say
such
a
thing
about
any
girl
without
the
utmost
certainty
she
purred
even
then
there
are
circumstances
under
which
one
ought
to
try
and
forget
it
but
if
it
is
a
question
as
to
my
veracity
in
the
matter
i
can
only
assure
you
that
miss
wynton
mission
to
switzerland
on
behalf
of
firefly
is
a
mere
blind
for
spencer
extraordinary
generosity
he
is
acting
through
the
paper
it
is
true
but
some
of
you
must
have
seen
firefly
how
could
such
a
poor
journal
afford
to
pay
a
young
lady
one
hundred
pounds
and
give
her
a
return
ticket
by
the
engadine
express
for
four
silly
articles
on
life
in
the
high
alps
why
it
is
ludicrous
pretty
hot
i
must
admit
sniggered
georgie
thinking
to
make
peace
with
beryl
wragg
but
she
seemed
to
find
his
humor
not
to
her
taste
it
is
the
kind
of
arrangement
from
which
one
draws
one
own
conclusions
said
vavasour
blandly
but
i
say
does
bower
know
this
asked
wragg
swinging
his
eyeglasses
nervously
though
he
dearly
loved
these
carpet
battles
he
was
chary
of
figuring
in
them
having
been
caught
badly
more
than
once
between
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
of
opposing
facts
you
heard
me
tell
him
was
millicent
confident
answer
if
he
requires
further
information
i
am
here
to
give
it
to
him
indeed
i
have
delayed
my
departure
for
that
very
reason
by
the
way
general
do
you
know
switzerland
well
every
hotel
in
the
country
he
boasted
proudly
i
do
quite
mean
in
that
sense
who
are
the
authorities
for
instance
if
i
had
a
friend
buried
in
the
cemetery
here
to
whom
should
i
apply
for
identification
of
the
grave
the
general
screwed
up
his
features
into
a
judicial
frown
well
er
i
should
go
to
the
communal
office
in
the
village
if
i
were
you
said
he
braving
his
mother
possible
displeasure
george
de
courcy
vavasour
asserted
his
manliness
for
beryl
benefit
i
know
the
right
johnny
he
said
let
me
take
you
to
him
miss
jaques
eh
what
millicent
affected
to
consider
the
proposal
she
saw
that
vavasour
was
content
it
is
very
kind
of
you
she
said
with
her
most
charming
smile
have
we
time
to
go
there
before
lunch
oh
loads
i
am
walking
toward
the
village
may
i
come
with
you
asked
beryl
wragg
that
will
be
too
delightful
said
millicent
georgie
feeling
the
claws
beneath
the
velvet
of
miss
wragg
voice
could
only
suffer
in
silence
the
three
went
out
together
the
two
women
did
the
talking
and
millicent
soon
discovered
that
bower
had
unquestionably
paid
court
to
helen
from
the
first
hour
of
his
arrival
in
the
maloja
whereas
spencer
seemed
to
be
an
utter
stranger
to
her
and
to
every
other
person
in
the
place
this
statement
offered
a
curious
discrepancy
to
the
story
retailed
by
mackenzie
assistant
but
it
strengthened
her
case
against
helen
she
grew
more
determined
than
ever
to
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
a
communal
official
raised
no
difficulty
about
giving
the
name
of
the
occupant
of
the
grave
marked
by
the
seventh
cross
from
the
tomb
she
described
a
child
was
buried
there
a
boy
who
died
three
years
ago
with
beryl
wragg
assistance
she
cross
examined
the
man
but
could
not
shake
his
faith
in
the
register
the
parents
still
lived
in
the
village
the
official
knew
them
and
remembered
the
boy
quite
well
he
had
contracted
a
fever
and
died
suddenly
this
was
disappointing
millicent
prepared
to
hear
of
a
tragedy
was
confronted
by
the
commonplace
but
the
special
imp
that
attends
all
mischief
makers
prompted
her
next
question
do
you
know
christian
stampa
the
guide
she
asked
the
man
grinned
yes
he
has
been
on
the
road
for
years
ever
since
he
lost
his
daughter
was
he
any
relation
to
the
boy
what
interest
would
he
have
in
this
particular
grave
the
custodian
of
parish
records
stroked
his
chin
he
took
thought
and
reached
for
another
ledger
he
ran
a
finger
through
an
index
and
turned
up
a
page
a
strange
thing
he
cried
why
that
is
the
very
place
where
etta
stampa
is
buried
you
see
he
explained
it
is
a
small
cemetery
and
our
people
are
poor
etta
stampa
was
this
the
clew
millicent
heart
throbbed
how
stupid
that
she
had
not
thought
of
a
woman
earlier
how
old
was
etta
stampa
she
inquired
her
age
is
given
here
as
nineteen
but
that
is
a
guess
it
was
a
sad
case
she
killed
herself
she
came
from
zermatt
i
have
lived
nearly
all
my
life
in
this
valley
and
hers
is
the
only
suicide
i
can
recall
why
did
she
kill
herself
and
when
the
official
supplied
the
date
but
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
affair
beyond
a
village
rumor
that
she
had
been
crossed
in
love
as
for
poor
old
stampa
who
met
with
an
accident
about
the
same
time
he
never
mentioned
her
stampa
is
the
lame
johnny
who
went
up
the
forno
yesterday
volunteered
georgie
when
they
quitted
the
office
but
i
say
miss
jaques
his
daughter
could
be
a
friend
of
yours
millicent
did
not
answer
she
was
thinking
deeply
then
she
realized
that
beryl
wragg
was
watching
her
intently
no
she
said
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
that
she
was
my
friend
only
that
one
whom
i
know
well
was
interested
in
her
can
you
tell
me
how
i
can
find
out
more
of
her
history
some
of
the
villagers
may
help
said
miss
wragg
shall
we
make
inquiries
it
is
marvelous
how
one
comes
across
things
in
the
most
unlikely
quarters
vavasour
whose
stroll
with
a
pretty
actress
had
resolved
itself
into
a
depressing
quest
into
the
records
of
the
local
cemetery
looked
at
his
watch
time
up
he
announced
firmly
the
luncheon
gong
will
go
in
a
minute
or
two
and
this
keen
air
makes
one
peckish
eh
what
so
millicent
returned
to
the
hotel
and
when
she
entered
the
dining
room
she
saw
helen
and
spencer
sitting
with
the
de
la
veres
edith
de
la
vere
stared
at
her
in
a
particularly
irritating
way
cynical
contempt
bored
amusement
even
a
quizzical
surprise
that
such
a
vulgar
person
could
be
so
well
dressed
were
carried
by
wireless
telegraphy
from
the
one
woman
to
the
other
millicent
countered
with
a
studied
indifference
she
gave
her
whole
attention
to
the
efforts
of
the
head
waiter
to
find
a
seat
to
her
liking
he
offered
her
the
choice
between
two
with
fine
self
control
she
selected
that
which
turned
her
back
on
helen
and
her
friends
she
had
just
taken
her
place
when
bower
came
in
he
stopped
near
the
door
and
spoke
to
an
under
manager
but
his
glance
swept
the
crowded
room
spencer
and
helen
happened
to
be
almost
facing
him
and
the
girl
was
listening
with
a
smile
to
something
the
american
was
saying
but
there
was
a
conscious
shyness
in
her
eyes
a
touch
of
color
on
her
sun
browned
face
that
revealed
more
than
she
imagined
bower
who
looked
ill
and
old
hesitated
perceptibly
then
he
seemed
to
reach
some
decision
he
walked
to
helen
side
and
bent
over
her
with
courteous
solicitude
i
hope
that
i
am
forgiven
he
said
she
started
she
was
so
absorbed
in
spencer
talk
which
dealt
with
nothing
more
noteworthy
than
the
excursion
down
the
vale
of
bregaglia
which
he
secretly
hoped
would
be
postponed
that
she
had
not
observed
bower
approach
forgiven
bower
for
what
she
asked
blushing
now
for
no
assignable
reason
for
yesterday
fright
and
its
sequel
but
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
please
do
think
i
am
only
a
fair
weather
mountaineer
no
i
am
not
likely
to
commit
that
mistake
it
was
feminine
spite
not
elemental
that
i
fancied
might
have
troubled
you
now
i
am
going
to
face
the
enemy
alone
pity
me
and
please
drink
to
my
success
he
favored
spencer
and
the
de
la
veres
with
a
comprehensive
nod
and
turned
away
well
satisfied
that
he
had
claimed
a
condition
of
confidence
of
mutual
trust
between
helen
and
himself
millicent
was
reading
the
menu
when
she
heard
bower
voice
at
her
shoulder
good
morning
millicent
he
said
shall
we
declare
a
truce
may
i
eat
at
your
table
that
at
least
will
be
original
picture
the
amazement
of
the
mob
if
the
lion
and
the
lamb
split
a
small
bottle
he
was
bold
but
chance
had
fenced
her
with
triple
brass
i
really
do
feel
inclined
to
forgive
you
she
said
with
a
quite
forgiving
smile
he
sat
down
the
two
were
watched
with
discreet
stupefaction
by
many
never
give
rein
to
your
emotions
millicent
you
did
so
last
night
and
blundered
badly
in
consequence
artifice
is
the
truest
art
you
know
let
us
then
be
unreal
and
act
as
though
we
were
the
dearest
friends
we
are
i
imagine
self
interest
should
keep
us
solid
bower
affected
a
momentary
absorption
in
the
wine
list
he
gave
his
order
and
the
waiter
left
them
now
i
want
you
to
be
good
he
said
put
your
cards
on
the
table
and
i
will
do
the
same
let
us
discuss
matters
without
prejudice
as
the
lawyers
say
and
in
the
first
instance
tell
me
exactly
what
you
imply
by
the
statement
that
charles
spencer
of
denver
colorado
as
he
appears
in
the
hotel
register
is
responsible
for
helen
wynton
presence
here
chapter
xv
a
coward
victory
it
is
a
queer
story
said
bower
because
it
is
true
retorted
millicent
yet
she
never
set
eyes
on
the
man
until
she
met
him
here
that
is
rather
impossible
is
it
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
on
the
day
i
arrived
in
maloja
a
letter
came
from
the
editor
of
firefly
telling
her
that
he
had
written
to
spencer
whom
he
knew
and
suggested
that
they
should
become
acquainted
these
things
are
easily
managed
said
millicent
airily
i
accept
miss
wynton
version
bower
spoke
with
brutal
frankness
the
morning
tribulation
had
worn
away
some
of
the
veneer
he
fully
expected
the
girl
to
flare
into
ill
suppressed
rage
then
he
could
deal
with
her
as
he
liked
he
had
not
earned
his
repute
in
the
city
of
london
without
revealing
at
times
the
innate
savagery
of
his
nature
as
soon
as
he
had
taunted
his
adversaries
into
a
passion
he
found
the
weak
joints
in
their
armor
he
was
surprised
now
that
millicent
should
laugh
if
she
was
acting
she
was
acting
well
it
is
too
funny
for
words
to
see
you
playing
the
trustful
swain
she
said
one
necessarily
believes
the
best
of
one
future
wife
so
you
still
keep
up
that
pretense
it
was
a
good
line
in
last
night
situation
but
it
becomes
farcical
when
applied
to
light
comedy
i
give
you
credit
for
sufficient
wit
to
understand
why
i
joined
you
here
we
can
avoid
unpleasant
explanations
i
am
prepared
to
bury
the
hatchet
on
terms
terms
yes
you
are
a
blackmailer
a
somewhat
dangerous
one
you
tempt
me
to
revise
the
wisest
of
la
rochefoucauld
maxims
and
say
that
every
woman
is
at
heart
a
snake
you
owe
everything
to
me
yet
you
are
not
content
without
my
help
you
would
still
be
carrying
a
banner
in
the
chorus
unless
i
continue
my
patronage
that
is
what
you
must
go
back
to
do
imagine
that
i
am
treating
with
you
out
of
sentiment
for
helen
sake
for
her
sake
only
i
offer
a
settlement
millicent
eyes
narrowed
a
little
but
she
affected
to
admire
the
gleaming
beads
in
a
glass
of
champagne
pray
continue
she
said
your
views
are
interesting
there
was
some
danger
lest
bower
should
reverse
his
wonted
procedure
and
lose
his
own
temper
in
this
unequal
duel
they
both
spoke
in
low
tones
anyone
watching
them
would
find
the
smiles
of
conventionality
on
their
lips
to
all
outward
seeming
they
were
indulging
in
a
friendly
gossip
of
course
you
want
money
he
said
that
is
the
and
of
your
existence
very
well
write
a
letter
to
miss
wynton
apologizing
for
your
conduct
take
yourself
away
from
here
at
three
and
from
moritz
by
the
next
train
and
i
not
only
withdraw
my
threat
to
bar
you
in
the
profession
but
shall
hand
you
a
check
for
a
thousand
pounds
millicent
pretended
to
consider
his
proposal
she
shook
her
head
not
nearly
enough
she
said
with
a
sweetly
deprecatory
moue
it
is
all
you
will
get
i
repeat
that
i
am
doing
this
to
spare
helen
feelings
perhaps
i
am
ill
advised
you
have
done
your
worst
already
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
crush
you
but
i
stick
to
the
bargain
for
five
minutes
dear
dear
she
sighed
only
five
minutes
do
you
get
rid
of
your
troubles
so
quickly
how
nice
to
be
a
man
and
to
be
able
to
settle
matters
with
such
promptitude
bower
was
undeniably
perplexed
but
he
held
to
his
line
unwavering
tenacity
of
purpose
was
his
chief
characteristic
meanwhile
he
said
let
us
talk
of
the
weather
a
most
seasonable
topic
it
was
altogether
novel
this
morning
to
wake
and
find
the
world
covered
with
snow
if
the
maloja
is
your
world
you
must
have
thought
it
rather
chilling
he
laughed
yes
cold
perhaps
but
fascinating
i
went
for
a
walk
you
see
i
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
what
i
should
do
for
the
best
a
woman
is
so
helpless
when
she
has
to
fight
a
big
strong
man
like
you
chance
led
me
to
the
cemetery
what
an
odd
little
place
it
is
would
you
hate
to
be
buried
there
it
was
now
millicent
turn
to
be
surprised
not
by
the
slightest
tremor
did
bower
betray
the
shock
caused
by
her
innuendo
his
nerves
were
proof
against
further
assault
that
day
fear
had
conquered
him
for
an
instant
when
he
looked
into
the
gate
of
darkness
with
its
passing
from
before
his
eyes
his
intellect
resumed
its
sway
and
he
weighed
events
by
that
nicely
adjusted
balance
none
but
a
man
who
greatly
dared
would
be
sitting
opposite
millicent
at
that
moment
none
but
a
fool
would
have
failed
to
understand
her
but
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
understood
he
refilled
his
glass
and
emptied
it
with
the
gusto
of
a
connoisseur
that
is
a
good
wine
he
said
sometimes
pints
are
better
than
quarts
although
of
the
same
vintage
waiter
another
half
bottle
please
no
more
for
me
of
course
murmured
millicent
i
must
keep
my
head
clear
so
much
depends
on
the
next
five
minutes
three
to
be
exact
ah
then
i
must
use
them
to
advantage
shall
i
tell
you
more
about
my
early
stroll
what
time
did
you
go
out
soon
after
ten
you
saw
what
a
most
exciting
struggle
and
what
shall
i
call
it
a
ceremony
bower
was
silent
for
an
appreciable
time
he
watched
a
waiter
uncorking
the
champagne
when
the
bottle
was
placed
on
the
table
he
pretended
to
read
the
label
he
was
thinking
that
stampa
marriage
service
was
not
so
futile
after
all
it
had
soon
erected
its
first
barrier
millicent
who
had
qualities
rare
in
a
woman
turned
and
looked
at
a
clock
incidentally
she
discovered
that
spencer
was
devoting
some
attention
to
the
proceedings
at
her
table
still
bower
remained
silent
she
stole
a
glance
at
him
she
was
conscious
that
an
abiding
dread
was
stealing
into
her
heart
but
her
stage
training
came
to
her
aid
and
she
managed
to
say
evenly
my
little
ramble
does
not
appear
to
interest
you
it
does
he
said
i
have
been
arguing
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
ticklish
problem
there
are
two
courses
to
me
i
can
either
bribe
you
or
leave
you
to
your
own
devices
the
latter
method
implies
the
interference
of
the
police
i
dislike
that
helen
would
certainly
be
opposed
to
it
i
make
the
one
thousand
into
five
but
i
want
your
answer
now
i
accept
she
said
instantly
ah
but
you
are
trembling
queer
is
it
how
thin
is
the
partition
between
affluence
and
a
prison
there
are
dozens
of
men
who
stand
high
in
commercial
circles
in
london
who
ought
to
be
in
jail
there
are
quite
as
many
convicts
in
portland
who
reached
penal
servitude
along
precisely
the
same
road
that
is
the
penalty
of
being
found
out
let
me
congratulate
you
and
do
try
another
glass
of
this
excellent
wine
you
need
it
and
you
have
to
pack
your
belongings
at
once
you
know
thank
you
her
eyes
sparkled
her
well
modulated
voice
was
hardly
under
control
five
thousand
pounds
was
a
great
deal
of
money
but
the
tragedy
of
etta
stampa
life
might
have
been
worth
more
how
could
she
find
out
the
whole
truth
she
must
accomplish
that
in
some
way
therein
however
she
greatly
miscalculated
bower
divined
her
thought
almost
before
it
was
formed
for
goodness
sake
let
us
put
things
in
plain
english
he
said
i
am
paying
you
handsomely
to
save
the
woman
i
am
going
to
marry
from
some
little
suffering
and
heartache
perhaps
it
is
unnecessary
her
fine
nature
might
forgive
a
man
a
transgression
of
his
youth
at
any
rate
i
avert
the
risk
by
this
payment
the
check
will
be
payable
to
you
personally
in
other
words
you
must
place
it
to
your
own
account
in
your
bank
any
breach
of
our
contract
in
letter
or
spirit
during
the
next
two
days
will
be
punished
by
its
stoppage
after
that
time
the
remotest
hint
on
your
part
of
any
scandalous
knowledge
affecting
me
or
helen
or
the
causes
which
led
to
my
present
weakness
in
allowing
you
to
blackmail
me
will
imply
the
immediate
issue
of
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
need
i
explain
the
position
at
greater
length
no
said
millicent
who
wished
now
that
she
had
bitten
off
the
end
of
her
tongue
before
she
vented
her
spleen
to
the
vavasours
and
the
wraggs
on
second
thoughts
went
on
bower
unconcernedly
i
forego
the
stipulation
as
to
a
letter
of
apology
i
do
suppose
helen
will
value
it
assuredly
i
do
not
the
cheapening
of
her
surrender
stung
more
than
she
counted
on
i
have
tried
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
uncalled
for
rudeness
she
blurted
out
well
yes
what
is
the
number
of
your
room
she
told
him
i
shall
send
the
check
to
you
at
once
have
you
finished
he
accompanied
her
to
the
door
bowed
her
out
and
came
back
smiling
affably
he
pulled
a
chair
to
de
la
vere
side
i
quite
enjoyed
my
luncheon
he
said
you
all
heard
that
stupid
outburst
of
millicent
last
night
so
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
you
that
she
regrets
it
she
is
leaving
the
hotel
forthwith
helen
rose
suddenly
she
is
one
of
my
few
friends
she
said
i
can
not
let
her
go
in
anger
she
is
unworthy
of
your
friendship
exclaimed
bower
sharply
take
my
advice
and
forget
that
she
exists
you
can
not
forget
that
anyone
exists
or
has
existed
said
spencer
quietly
what
you
too
said
bower
his
eyes
sought
the
american
and
flashed
an
unspoken
challenge
he
felt
that
the
world
was
a
few
hundred
years
too
old
there
were
historical
precedents
for
settling
affairs
such
as
that
now
troubling
him
by
means
that
would
have
appealed
to
him
but
he
opposed
no
further
hindrance
to
helen
departure
indeed
he
perceived
that
her
meeting
with
millicent
would
provide
in
some
sense
a
test
of
his
own
judgment
he
would
soon
learn
whether
or
not
money
would
prevail
he
waited
a
little
while
and
then
sent
his
valet
with
the
check
and
a
request
for
an
acknowledgment
the
man
brought
him
a
scribbled
note
was
rather
taken
aback
by
appearance
of
she
says
you
told
her
i
was
leaving
the
hotel
we
fell
on
each
neck
and
wept
is
that
right
m
j
he
cut
the
end
off
a
cigar
lit
the
paper
with
a
match
and
lit
the
cigar
with
the
paper
five
thousand
pounds
he
said
to
himself
it
is
a
lot
of
money
to
one
who
has
none
i
remember
the
time
when
i
would
have
sold
my
soul
to
the
devil
for
half
the
amount
but
that
was
not
a
pleasing
notion
it
suggested
that
by
evil
hazard
some
such
contract
had
in
fact
been
made
but
forgotten
by
one
of
the
parties
to
it
so
he
dismissed
it
having
disposed
of
stampa
and
millicent
practically
between
breakfast
and
lunch
there
were
no
reasons
why
he
should
trouble
further
about
them
the
american
threatened
a
fresh
obstacle
he
was
winning
his
way
with
helen
altogether
too
rapidly
in
the
light
of
those
ominous
words
at
the
luncheon
table
his
close
association
with
stampa
indicated
a
definite
knowledge
of
the
past
curse
him
why
did
he
interfere
bower
was
eminently
a
selfish
man
he
had
enjoyed
unchecked
success
for
so
long
a
time
that
he
railed
now
at
the
series
of
mischances
that
tripped
the
feet
of
his
desires
looking
back
through
recent
days
he
was
astonished
to
find
how
often
spencer
had
crossed
his
path
before
he
was
four
hours
in
maloja
helen
in
his
hearing
had
singled
out
the
american
for
conjecture
and
scrutiny
then
dunston
spoke
of
the
same
man
as
an
eager
adversary
at
baccarat
but
the
promised
game
was
arranged
without
spencer
coöperation
greatly
to
dunston
loss
a
man
did
not
act
in
such
fashion
without
some
motive
what
was
it
this
reserved
somewhat
contemptuous
rival
had
also
snatched
helen
from
his
company
many
times
he
had
undoubtedly
rendered
some
service
in
coming
to
the
forno
hut
but
bower
own
lapse
from
sanity
on
that
occasion
did
not
escape
his
notice
finally
this
cool
mannered
alert
youngster
from
the
new
world
did
not
seem
to
care
a
fig
for
any
prior
claim
on
helen
affections
his
whole
attitude
might
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
was
stampa
employer
and
had
won
the
old
confidence
yes
the
american
was
the
real
danger
that
pale
ghost
conjured
from
the
grave
by
stampa
was
intangible
powerless
a
dreamlike
wraith
evoked
by
a
madman
fancy
already
the
fear
engendered
myopia
of
the
morning
was
passing
from
bower
eyes
the
passage
of
arms
with
millicent
had
done
him
good
he
saw
now
that
if
he
meant
to
win
helen
he
must
fight
for
her
glancing
at
his
watch
he
found
that
the
time
was
a
quarter
to
three
he
opened
a
window
in
his
sitting
room
which
was
situated
in
the
front
of
the
hotel
by
leaning
out
he
could
survey
the
carriage
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
long
flight
of
steps
a
vehicle
was
drawn
up
there
and
men
were
fastening
portly
dress
baskets
in
the
baggage
carrier
over
the
hind
wheels
he
smiled
the
pretty
dancer
travels
luxuriously
he
thought
i
wonder
whether
she
will
be
honest
enough
to
pay
her
debts
with
my
money
he
still
hated
her
for
having
dragged
him
into
a
public
squabble
he
looked
to
the
future
to
requite
him
a
year
two
years
would
soon
pass
then
when
funds
were
low
and
engagements
scarce
she
would
appeal
to
him
again
and
his
solicitors
would
reply
he
caught
himself
framing
curt
stinging
sentences
to
be
embodied
in
the
letter
but
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
start
surely
there
was
something
very
wrong
with
mark
bower
the
millionaire
when
he
gloated
over
such
paltry
details
why
his
reflections
were
worthy
of
that
old
spitfire
de
courcy
vavasour
his
cigar
had
gone
out
he
threw
it
away
it
had
the
taste
of
millicent
cheap
passion
a
decanter
of
brandy
stood
on
the
table
and
he
drank
a
small
quantity
though
he
had
imbibed
freely
of
champagne
at
luncheon
he
glanced
at
a
mirror
his
face
was
flushed
and
care
lined
and
he
scowled
at
his
own
apparition
i
must
go
and
see
the
last
of
millicent
it
will
cheer
me
up
he
said
to
himself
when
he
entered
the
foyer
millicent
was
already
in
the
veranda
a
dainty
picture
in
furs
and
feathers
somewhat
to
his
surprise
helen
was
with
her
a
good
many
people
were
watching
them
covertly
a
quite
natural
proceeding
in
view
of
their
strained
relations
overnight
illustration
it
will
paralyze
the
dowager
brigade
if
we
hug
each
other
millicent
first
action
after
quitting
the
à
had
been
to
worm
out
of
léontine
the
full
true
and
particular
history
of
etta
stampa
or
so
much
of
the
story
as
was
known
to
the
hotel
servants
the
recital
was
cut
short
by
helen
visit
but
resumed
during
packing
operations
as
millicent
had
enlarged
her
store
of
knowledge
considerably
during
the
process
of
reconciliation
so
alive
to
possibilities
going
far
beyond
a
single
check
even
for
five
thousand
pounds
at
the
last
moment
she
sent
a
message
to
helen
come
and
see
me
off
she
wrote
it
will
simply
paralyze
the
dowager
brigade
if
we
hug
each
other
on
the
mat
helen
agreed
she
was
not
sorry
that
her
critics
should
be
paralyzed
or
stupefied
or
rendered
incapable
in
some
way
of
inflicting
further
annoyance
in
her
present
radiant
mood
nearly
all
her
troubles
having
taken
unto
themselves
wings
she
looked
on
yesterday
episode
in
the
light
of
a
rather
far
fetched
joke
bower
stood
so
high
in
her
esteem
that
she
was
sure
the
outspoken
announcement
of
his
intentions
was
dictated
chiefly
by
anger
at
millicent
unfair
utterances
perhaps
he
had
some
thought
of
marriage
but
he
must
seek
a
wife
in
a
more
exalted
sphere
she
felt
in
her
heart
that
spencer
was
only
awaiting
a
favorable
opportunity
to
declare
his
love
and
she
did
not
strive
to
repress
the
wave
of
divine
happiness
that
flooded
her
heart
at
the
thought
after
much
secret
pondering
and
some
shy
confidences
intrusted
to
de
la
vere
she
had
resolved
to
tell
him
that
if
he
left
the
maloja
at
once
an
elastic
phrase
in
lovers
language
and
came
to
her
in
london
next
month
she
would
have
an
answer
ready
she
persuaded
herself
that
there
was
no
other
honorable
way
out
of
an
embarrassing
position
she
had
come
to
switzerland
for
work
not
for
love
making
spencer
would
probably
wish
to
marry
her
forthwith
and
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
while
the
firefly
commission
was
only
half
completed
all
of
which
modest
and
maidenly
reasoning
left
wholly
out
of
account
spencer
strenuous
wooing
it
is
chronicled
here
merely
to
show
her
state
of
mind
when
she
kissed
millicent
farewell
it
is
worthy
of
note
also
that
two
young
people
who
might
be
expected
to
take
the
liveliest
interest
in
each
other
company
were
steadfast
in
their
determination
to
separate
each
meant
to
send
the
other
back
to
england
with
the
least
possible
delay
and
both
were
eager
to
fly
into
each
other
arms
in
london
whereat
the
gods
may
have
laughed
or
frowned
as
the
case
may
be
if
they
glanced
at
the
horoscopes
of
certain
mortals
pent
within
the
mountain
walls
of
the
upper
engadine
while
helen
was
still
gazing
after
millicent
retreating
carriage
bower
came
from
the
darksome
foyer
to
the
sunlit
veranda
so
you
parted
the
best
of
friends
he
said
quietly
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
shining
eyes
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
that
a
stupid
misunderstanding
should
be
cleared
away
she
said
then
i
share
your
pleasure
though
to
be
candid
i
was
thinking
that
a
woman
kiss
has
infinite
gradations
it
may
savor
of
paradise
or
the
dead
sea
but
she
told
me
how
grieved
she
was
that
she
had
behaved
so
foolishly
and
appealed
to
me
not
to
let
the
folly
of
a
day
break
the
friendship
of
years
ah
millicent
picks
up
some
well
turned
sentiments
on
the
stage
come
out
for
a
little
stroll
and
tell
me
all
about
it
helen
hesitated
it
will
soon
be
tea
time
she
said
with
a
self
conscious
blush
she
had
promised
spencer
to
walk
with
him
to
the
château
but
her
visit
to
millicent
had
intervened
and
he
was
not
on
the
veranda
at
the
moment
we
need
not
go
far
the
sun
has
garnished
the
roads
for
us
what
do
you
say
if
we
make
for
the
village
and
interview
johann
klucker
cat
on
the
weather
his
tone
was
quite
reassuring
to
her
transparent
honesty
of
purpose
it
seemed
better
that
they
should
discuss
millicent
motive
in
coming
to
the
hotel
and
then
dismiss
it
for
ever
a
most
excellent
idea
she
cried
lightly
i
have
been
writing
all
the
morning
so
a
breath
of
fresh
air
will
be
grateful
they
passed
down
the
steps
they
had
not
gone
more
than
a
few
paces
when
the
driver
of
an
empty
carriage
pulled
up
his
vehicle
and
handed
bower
a
telegram
they
gave
it
to
me
at
moritz
herr
bower
he
said
i
took
a
message
there
for
herr
spencer
and
they
asked
me
to
bring
this
to
you
as
it
would
reach
you
more
quickly
than
if
it
came
by
the
post
bower
thanked
the
man
and
opened
the
envelop
it
was
a
very
long
telegram
but
he
only
glanced
at
it
in
the
most
cursory
manner
before
putting
it
in
a
pocket
at
a
distant
corner
of
the
road
by
the
side
of
the
lake
millicent
turned
for
a
last
look
at
the
hotel
and
waved
a
hand
at
them
helen
replied
i
almost
wish
now
she
was
staying
here
a
few
days
she
said
wistfully
she
ought
to
have
seen
our
valley
in
its
summer
greenery
i
fear
she
brought
winter
in
her
train
was
bower
comment
but
the
famous
cat
must
decide
here
boy
he
went
on
hailing
a
village
urchin
where
is
johann
klucker
house
the
boy
pointed
to
a
track
that
ran
close
to
the
right
bank
of
the
tiny
inn
he
explained
volubly
and
was
rewarded
with
a
franc
do
you
know
this
path
asked
bower
klucker
chalet
is
near
the
waterfall
which
should
be
a
fine
sight
owing
to
the
melting
snow
it
was
helen
favorite
walk
she
would
have
preferred
a
more
frequented
route
but
the
group
of
houses
described
by
the
boy
was
quite
near
and
she
could
devise
no
excuse
for
keeping
to
the
busy
highway
as
the
path
was
narrow
she
walked
in
front
the
grass
and
flowers
seemed
to
have
drawn
fresh
tints
from
the
snow
which
had
cleared
away
with
magical
rapidity
from
this
sheltered
spot
but
the
little
rivulet
usually
diamond
bright
was
now
a
turbulent
and
foaming
stream
care
was
needed
not
to
slip
if
anyone
fell
into
that
miniature
torrent
it
would
be
no
easy
matter
to
escape
without
broken
bones
would
you
ever
believe
that
a
few
hours
snow
followed
by
a
hot
sun
would
make
such
a
difference
to
a
mere
ribbon
of
water
like
this
she
asked
when
they
were
passing
through
a
narrow
cleft
in
a
wall
of
rock
through
which
the
inn
roared
with
a
quite
respectable
fury
i
am
in
a
mood
to
believe
anything
said
bower
do
you
remember
our
first
meeting
at
the
embankment
hotel
who
would
have
imagined
then
that
millicent
jaques
a
few
weeks
later
would
rush
a
thousand
miles
to
the
maloja
and
scream
her
woes
to
heaven
and
the
multitude
neither
you
nor
i
i
fancy
had
seen
her
during
the
interval
did
she
tell
you
the
cause
of
her
extraordinary
behavior
no
i
did
not
ask
her
but
it
scarce
needed
explanation
bower
i
i
fear
she
suspected
me
of
flirting
it
was
unjust
but
i
can
well
conceive
that
a
woman
who
thinks
her
friend
is
robbing
her
of
a
affections
does
not
wait
to
consider
nice
points
of
procedure
surely
millicent
did
not
say
that
i
had
promised
to
marry
her
though
helen
was
not
prepared
for
this
downright
plunge
into
an
embarrassing
discussion
she
managed
to
evade
a
direct
answer
there
was
more
than
a
suggestion
of
that
in
her
words
last
night
she
said
perhaps
she
thought
so
in
all
seriousness
you
seem
to
have
undeceived
her
and
i
am
sure
you
must
have
dealt
with
her
kindly
or
she
would
not
have
acknowledged
her
mistake
in
such
frank
terms
to
me
there
now
that
is
the
end
of
a
very
disagreeable
episode
shall
we
say
no
more
about
it
helen
was
flushed
and
hurried
of
speech
but
she
persevered
bravely
hoping
that
bower
tact
would
not
desert
him
at
this
crisis
she
quickened
her
pace
a
little
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
said
the
last
word
on
a
difficult
topic
and
is
anxious
to
forget
it
bower
overtook
her
he
grasped
her
shoulder
almost
roughly
and
drew
her
round
till
she
faced
him
you
are
trying
to
escape
me
helen
he
said
hoarsely
that
is
impossible
someone
must
have
told
you
what
i
said
to
millicent
in
the
hearing
of
all
who
chose
to
listen
her
amazing
outburst
forced
from
me
an
avowal
that
should
have
been
made
to
you
alone
helen
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
i
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
i
have
my
faults
what
man
is
flawless
but
i
have
the
abiding
virtue
of
loving
you
i
shall
make
your
life
happy
helen
for
god
sake
do
not
tell
me
that
you
are
already
promised
to
another
his
eyes
blazed
into
hers
with
a
passion
that
was
appalling
in
its
intensity
she
seemed
to
lose
the
power
to
speak
or
move
she
looked
up
at
him
like
a
frightened
child
who
hears
strange
words
that
she
does
not
comprehend
thinking
he
had
won
her
he
threw
his
arms
about
her
and
strained
her
fiercely
to
his
breast
he
strove
to
kiss
away
the
tears
that
began
to
fall
in
piteous
protest
but
she
bent
her
head
as
if
in
shame
oh
please
let
me
go
she
sobbed
please
let
me
go
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
treat
me
so
cruelly
cruelly
helen
how
should
i
be
cruel
to
you
whom
i
hold
so
dear
still
he
clasped
her
tightly
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
in
his
transport
of
joy
at
the
belief
that
she
was
his
she
struggled
to
free
herself
she
shrank
from
this
physical
contact
with
a
strange
repulsion
she
felt
as
a
timid
animal
must
feel
when
some
lord
of
the
jungle
pulls
it
down
and
drags
it
to
his
lair
bower
was
kissing
her
cheeks
her
forehead
her
hair
finding
a
mad
rapture
in
the
fragrance
of
her
skin
he
crushed
her
in
a
close
embrace
that
was
almost
suffocating
oh
please
let
me
go
she
wailed
you
frighten
me
let
me
go
how
dare
you
she
fought
so
wildly
that
he
yielded
to
a
dim
sense
that
she
was
in
earnest
he
relaxed
his
grip
with
the
instinct
of
a
hunted
thing
she
took
a
dangerous
leap
for
safety
clean
across
the
swollen
inn
luckily
she
alighted
on
a
broad
boulder
or
a
sprained
ankle
would
have
been
the
least
penalty
for
that
desperate
means
of
escape
as
she
stood
there
with
tears
streaming
down
her
face
and
the
crimson
brand
of
angry
terror
on
her
brow
the
dreadful
knowledge
that
he
had
lost
her
smote
bower
like
a
rush
of
cold
air
from
a
newly
opened
tomb
between
them
brawled
the
tiny
torrent
it
offered
no
bar
to
an
active
man
but
even
in
his
panic
of
sudden
perception
he
resisted
the
impulse
that
bade
him
follow
helen
he
pleaded
stretching
forth
his
hands
in
frenzied
gesture
why
do
you
cast
me
off
i
swear
by
all
a
man
holds
sacred
that
i
mean
no
wrong
you
are
dear
to
me
as
life
itself
ah
helen
say
that
i
may
hope
i
do
not
even
ask
for
your
love
i
shall
win
that
by
a
lifetime
of
devotion
at
last
she
found
utterance
he
had
alarmed
her
greatly
but
no
woman
can
feel
it
an
outrage
that
a
man
should
avow
his
longing
and
she
pitied
bower
with
a
great
pity
deep
down
in
her
heart
was
a
suspicion
that
they
might
have
been
happy
together
had
they
met
sooner
she
would
never
have
loved
him
she
knew
that
now
beyond
cavil
but
if
they
were
married
she
must
have
striven
to
make
life
pleasant
for
him
while
she
drifted
down
the
smooth
stream
of
existence
free
from
either
abiding
joys
or
carking
sorrows
i
am
more
grieved
than
i
can
tell
that
this
should
have
happened
she
said
striving
hard
to
restrain
the
sob
in
her
voice
though
it
gave
her
words
the
ring
of
genuine
regret
i
little
dreamed
that
you
thought
of
me
in
that
way
bower
but
i
can
never
marry
you
never
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
surely
you
will
help
me
to
dispel
the
memory
of
a
foolish
moment
it
has
been
trying
to
both
of
us
let
us
pretend
that
it
never
was
had
she
struck
him
with
a
whip
he
could
not
have
flinched
so
visibly
beneath
the
lash
as
from
the
patent
honesty
of
her
words
for
a
time
he
did
not
answer
and
the
sudden
calm
that
came
quick
on
the
heels
of
frenzy
had
in
it
a
weird
peacefulness
neither
could
ever
again
forget
the
noisy
rush
of
the
stream
the
glad
singing
of
birds
in
a
thicket
overhanging
the
bank
the
tinkle
of
the
cow
bells
as
the
cattle
began
to
climb
to
the
pastures
for
a
luxurious
hour
ere
sundown
it
was
typical
of
their
lives
that
they
should
be
divided
by
the
infant
inn
almost
at
its
source
and
that
thenceforth
the
barrier
should
become
ever
wider
and
deeper
till
it
reached
the
infinite
sea
he
seemed
to
take
his
defeat
well
he
was
pale
and
his
lips
twitched
with
the
effort
to
attain
composure
he
looked
at
helen
with
a
hungry
longing
that
was
slowly
acknowledging
restraint
i
must
have
frightened
you
he
said
breaking
a
silence
that
was
growing
irksome
of
course
i
apologize
for
that
but
we
can
not
leave
things
where
they
are
if
you
must
send
me
away
from
you
i
may
at
least
demand
a
clear
understanding
have
no
fear
that
i
shall
distress
you
further
may
i
join
you
or
will
you
walk
to
the
bridge
a
little
higher
up
let
us
return
to
the
hotel
she
protested
no
no
we
are
not
children
we
have
broken
no
law
of
god
or
man
why
should
i
be
ashamed
of
having
asked
you
to
marry
me
or
you
to
listen
even
though
it
be
such
a
hopeless
fantasy
as
you
say
helen
deeply
moved
in
his
behalf
walked
to
a
bridge
of
planks
a
little
distance
up
stream
bower
joined
her
there
he
had
deliberately
resolved
to
do
a
dastardly
thing
if
spencer
was
the
cause
of
refusal
that
obstacle
at
any
rate
could
be
smashed
to
a
pulp
now
helen
he
said
i
want
you
to
believe
that
your
happiness
is
my
only
concern
perhaps
at
some
other
time
you
may
allow
me
to
renew
in
less
abrupt
manner
the
proposal
i
have
made
but
when
you
hear
all
that
i
have
to
tell
you
will
be
forced
to
admit
that
i
placed
your
high
repute
above
every
other
consideration
in
declaring
my
love
before
rather
than
after
you
learned
how
and
why
you
came
to
switzerland
his
manner
was
becoming
more
calm
and
judicial
each
moment
it
reacted
on
helen
who
gazed
at
him
with
a
very
natural
surprise
in
her
still
eyes
that
at
least
is
simple
enough
she
cried
no
it
is
menacing
ugly
a
trick
calculated
to
wound
you
sorely
when
first
it
came
to
my
ears
i
refused
to
credit
the
vile
meanness
of
it
you
saw
that
telegram
which
reached
my
hands
as
we
quitted
the
hotel
it
is
a
reply
to
certain
inquiries
i
caused
to
be
made
in
london
read
it
helen
took
the
crumpled
sheets
of
thin
paper
and
began
to
read
bower
watched
her
face
with
a
maleficent
confidence
that
might
have
warned
her
had
she
seen
it
but
she
paid
heed
to
nothing
else
at
that
moment
save
the
mysterious
words
scrawled
in
a
foreign
handwriting
have
investigated
incident
fully
pargrave
compelled
mackenzie
to
explain
the
american
charles
spencer
recently
residing
at
embankment

miss
helen
wynton
expenses
including
cost
of
publishing
her
articles
he
followed
her
on
the
day
of
her
departure
and

since
asked

pargrave

annoyed

chapter
xvi
spencer
explains
a
sustained
rapping
on
the
inner
door
of
the
hut
roused
helen
from
dreamless
sleep
in
the
twilight
of
the
mind
that
exists
between
sleeping
and
waking
she
was
bewildered
by
the
darkness
perhaps
baffled
by
her
novel
surroundings
she
strove
to
pierce
the
gloom
with
unseeing
eyes
but
the
voice
of
her
guide
broke
the
spell
time
to
get
up
the
sun
is
on
the
rock
and
we
have
a
piece
of
bad
snow
to
cross
then
she
remembered
and
sighed
the
sigh
was
involuntary
the
half
conscious
tribute
of
a
wearied
heart
it
needed
an
effort
to
brace
herself
against
the
long
hours
of
a
new
day
the
hours
when
thoughts
would
come
unbidden
when
regrets
that
she
was
fighting
almost
fiercely
would
rush
in
and
threaten
to
overwhelm
her
but
helen
was
brave
she
had
the
courage
that
springs
from
the
conviction
of
having
done
that
which
is
right
if
she
was
a
woman
too
with
a
infinite
capacity
for
suffering
well
that
demanded
another
sort
of
bravery
a
resolve
to
subdue
the
soul
murmurings
a
spiritual
in
the
determination
to
prevail
a
complete
acceptance
of
unmerited
wrongs
in
obedience
to
some
inexplicable
decree
of
providence
so
she
rose
from
a
couch
which
at
least
demanded
perfect
physical
health
ere
one
could
find
rest
on
it
and
being
fully
dressed
went
forth
at
once
to
drink
the
steaming
hot
coffee
that
filled
the
tiny
hut
with
its
fragrance
a
fine
morning
pietro
she
asked
addressing
the
man
who
had
summoned
her
dawn
is
breaking
with
good
promise
there
is
a
slight
mist
on
the
glacier
but
the
rock
shows
clear
in
the
sun
she
knew
that
an
amiable
grin
was
on
the
man
face
but
it
was
so
dark
in
the
that
she
could
see
little
beyond
the
figures
of
the
guide
and
his
companion
she
went
to
the
door
and
stood
for
a
minute
on
the
narrow
platform
of
rough
stones
that
provided
the
only
level
space
in
a
witches
cauldron
of
moss
covered
boulders
and
rough
ice
beneath
her
feet
was
an
ultramarine
mist
around
her
were
masses
of
black
rock
but
overhead
was
a
glorious
pink
canopy
fringed
by
far
flung
circles
of
translucent
blue
and
tenderest
green
and
this
heaven
own
shield
was
ever
widening
eastward
its
arc
was
broken
by
an
irregular
dark
mass
whose
pinnacles
glittered
like
burnished
gold
that
was
the
aguagliouls
rock
which
rises
so
magnificently
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
ice
field
like
some
great
portal
to
the
wonderland
of
the
bernina
she
had
seen
it
the
night
before
after
leaving
the
small
restaurant
that
nestles
at
the
foot
of
the
roseg
glacier
then
its
scarred
sides
brightened
by
the
crimson
and
violet
rays
of
the
setting
sun
looked
friendly
and
inviting
though
its
base
was
a
good
mile
distant
across
the
surface
of
the
ice
she
could
discern
every
crevice
and
ledge
and
steep
couloir
now
all
these
distinguishing
features
were
merged
in
the
mist
the
great
wall
itself
seemed
to
be
one
vast
unscalable
precipice
capped
by
a
series
of
shining
spires
and
for
the
first
time
in
three
sorrowful
days
while
her
eyes
dwelt
on
that
castle
above
the
clouds
the
mysterious
grandeur
of
nature
healed
her
vexed
spirit
and
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
fell
upon
her
the
miserable
intrigues
and
jealousies
of
the
past
weeks
were
so
insignificant
so
far
away
up
here
among
the
mountains
had
she
only
consulted
her
own
happiness
she
mused
she
would
not
have
ordered
events
differently
there
was
no
real
reason
why
she
should
have
flown
from
the
hotel
like
a
timid
deer
roused
by
hounds
from
a
thicket
instead
of
doubling
and
twisting
from
moritz
to
samaden
and
back
by
carriage
to
a
remote
hotel
in
the
roseg
valley
she
might
have
remained
and
defied
her
persecutors
but
now
the
fume
and
fret
were
ended
and
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
she
was
glad
she
felt
that
she
could
never
again
endure
the
sight
of
bower
face
the
memory
of
his
passionate
embrace
of
his
blazing
eyes
of
the
thick
sensual
lips
that
forced
their
loathsome
kisses
upon
her
was
bitter
enough
without
the
need
of
reviving
it
each
time
they
met
she
was
sorry
it
was
impossible
to
bid
farewell
to
de
la
vere
any
hint
of
her
intent
would
have
drawn
from
that
cynic
a
flood
of
remonstrance
hard
to
stem
though
nothing
short
of
force
would
have
kept
helen
at
maloja
once
she
was
sure
of
spencer
double
dealing
of
course
she
might
write
to
de
la
vere
when
she
was
in
calmer
mood
it
would
be
easier
then
to
pick
and
choose
the
words
that
would
convey
in
full
measure
her
detestation
of
the
american
for
she
hated
him
yes
hatred
alone
was
satisfying
she
despised
her
own
heart
because
it
whispered
a
protest
yet
she
feared
him
too
it
was
from
him
that
she
fled
she
admitted
this
to
her
honest
mind
while
she
watched
the
spreading
radiance
of
the
new
day
she
feared
the
candor
of
his
steady
eyes
more
than
the
wiles
and
hypocrisies
of
bower
and
her
false
friend
millicent
by
a
half
miraculous
insight
into
the
history
of
recent
events
she
saw
that
bower
had
followed
her
to
switzerland
with
evil
intent
but
the
discovery
embittered
her
the
more
against
spencer
who
had
lured
her
there
deliberately
than
against
bower
who
knew
of
it
nor
scrupled
to
use
the
knowledge
as
best
it
marched
with
his
designs
it
was
nothing
to
her
she
told
herself
that
spencer
no
less
than
bower
had
renounced
his
earlier
purpose
and
was
ready
to
marry
her
she
still
quivered
with
anger
at
the
thought
that
she
had
fallen
so
blindly
into
the
toils
even
though
she
accepted
astounding
commission
she
might
have
guessed
that
there
was
some
ignoble
element
underlying
it
she
felt
now
that
it
was
possible
to
be
prepared
to
scrutinize
occurrences
more
closely
to
hold
herself
aloof
from
compromising
incidents
the
excursion
to
the
forno
the
manifest
interest
she
displayed
in
both
men
the
concealment
of
her
whereabouts
from
friends
in
london
her
stiff
lipped
indifference
to
the
opinion
of
other
residents
in
the
hotel
these
things
trivial
individually
united
into
a
strong
self
indictment
as
for
spencer
though
she
meant
above
all
things
to
avoid
meeting
him
and
hoped
that
he
was
now
well
on
his
way
to
the
wide
world
beyond
maloja
she
would
never
forgive
him
no
never
i
am
sorry
to
hurry
you
but
there
is
a
bit
of
really
bad
snow
on
the
sella
pass
urged
pietro
apologetically
at
her
shoulder
and
she
reëntered
the
hut
at
once
sitting
down
to
that
which
she
deemed
to
be
her
last
meal
on
the
swiss
side
of
the
upper
engadine
it
was
in
a
hotel
at
moritz
that
she
had
settled
her
route
with
the
aid
of
a
map
and
a
guidebook
when
on
that
day
of
great
happenings
she
quitted
the
she
stipulated
that
the
utmost
secrecy
should
be
observed
as
to
her
departure
her
boxes
and
portmanteau
were
brought
from
her
room
by
the
little
used
exit
she
had
discovered
soon
after
her
arrival
a
closed
carriage
met
her
there
in
the
dusk
and
she
drove
straight
to
moritz
station
leaving
her
baggage
in
the
parcels
office
she
sought
a
quiet
hotel
for
the
night
registering
her
room
under
her
mother
maiden
name
of
trenholme
she
meant
to
return
to
england
by
the
earliest
train
in
the
morning
but
her
terror
of
encountering
spencer
set
in
motion
a
scheme
for
evading
pursuit
either
by
him
or
bower
by
going
up
the
roseg
valley
and
carrying
the
barest
necessaries
for
a
few
days
travel
she
could
cross
the
bernina
range
into
italy
reach
the
rail
at
sondrio
and
go
round
by
como
to
lucerne
and
thence
to
basle
whither
the
excellent
swiss
system
of
delivering
luggage
would
convey
her
bulky
packages
long
before
she
was
ready
to
claim
them
with
a
sense
of
equity
that
was
creditable
she
made
up
her
mind
to
expend
every
farthing
of
the
money
received
from
the
firefly
she
had
kept
her
contract
faithfully
mackenzie
therefore
or
spencer
must
abide
by
it
to
the
last
letter
the
third
article
of
the
series
was
already
written
and
in
the
post
the
fourth
she
wrote
quietly
in
her
room
at
the
moritz
hotel
nor
did
she
stir
out
during
the
next
day
until
it
was
dark
when
she
walked
a
few
yards
up
the
main
street
to
buy
a
rucksack
and
an
alpenstock
early
next
morning
close
wrapped
and
veiled
she
took
a
carriage
to
the
restaurant
du
glacier
here
she
met
an
unforeseen
check
the
local
guides
were
absent
in
the
bernina
and
the
hotel
proprietor
good
careful
man
would
not
hear
of
intrusting
the
pretty
english
girl
to
inexperienced
villagers
but
persuaded
her
to
await
the
coming
of
a
party
from
italy
whose
rooms
were
bespoke
their
guides
in
all
probability
would
be
returning
over
the
sella
pass
and
would
charge
far
less
for
the
journey
he
was
right
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
three
tired
englishmen
arrived
at
the
restaurant
and
their
hardy
italian
pilots
were
only
too
glad
to
find
a
ready
to
start
at
once
for
the
mortel
hut
whence
a
nine
hours
climb
would
take
them
back
to
the
val
malenco
provided
they
crossed
the
dangerous
névé
on
the
upper
part
of
the
glacier
soon
after
daybreak
pietro
the
leader
was
a
cheery
soul
like
others
of
his
type
in
the
bernina
region
he
spoke
a
good
deal
of
german
and
his
fund
of
pleasant
anecdote
and
reminiscence
kept
helen
from
brooding
on
her
own
troubles
during
the
long
evening
in
the
hut
and
now
while
she
was
finishing
her
meal
in
the
dim
light
of
dawn
and
the
second
guide
was
packing
their
few
belongings
pietro
regaled
her
with
a
legend
of
the
monte
del
diavolo
which
overlooks
sondrio
and
the
lovely
valley
of
the
adda
once
upon
a
time
they
used
to
grow
fine
grapes
there
he
said
and
the
wine
was
always
sent
to
rome
for
the
special
use
of
the
pope
and
his
cardinals
that
made
the
people
proud
and
the
devil
took
possession
of
them
which
greatly
grieved
a
pious
hermit
who
dwelt
in
a
cell
in
the
little
val
malgina
by
the
side
of
a
torrent
that
flows
into
the
adda
so
one
day
he
asked
the
good
lord
to
permit
the
devil
to
visit
him
but
when
satan
appeared
the
saint
laughed
at
him
he
cried
sent
for
you
you
are
not
the
prince
of
the
infernal
regions
i
not
said
the
stranger
with
a
truly
fiendish
grin
try
my
powers
and
see
what
will
happen
well
said
the
saint
me
twenty
barrels
of
better
wine
than
can
be
grown
in
sondrio
so
old
barbariccia
stamped
his
hoof
and
lo
there
were
the
twenty
barrels
while
the
mere
scent
of
them
nearly
made
the
saint
break
a
vow
that
he
would
never
again
taste
fermented
wine
but
he
held
fast
and
said
drink
the
lot
nonsense
roared
the
devil
said
the
hermit
not
much
of
a
devil
if
you
ca
do
in
a
moment
what
the
college
of
cardinals
can
do
in
a
week
that
annoyed
satan
and
he
put
away
barrel
after
barrel
until
the
saint
began
to
feel
very
uneasy
but
the
last
barrel
finished
him
and
down
he
went
like
a
log
whereupon
the
holy
man
put
him
into
one
of
his
own
tubs
and
sent
him
to
rome
to
be
dealt
with
properly
there
was
a
tremendous
row
it
is
said
when
the
cask
was
opened
in
the
confusion
satan
escaped
but
in
revenge
for
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
him
he
put
a
blight
on
the
vines
of
the
adda
and
from
that
day
to
this
never
a
liter
of
decent
wine
came
out
of
sondrio
i
guess
if
that
occurred
anywhere
in
italy
nowadays
they
lynch
the
hermit
said
a
voice
in
english
outside
helen
screamed
and
the
two
italians
were
startled
no
one
was
expected
at
the
hut
at
that
hour
its
earliest
visitors
should
come
from
the
inner
range
after
a
long
tramp
from
italy
or
pontresina
sorry
if
i
scared
you
said
spencer
his
tall
figure
suddenly
darkening
the
doorway
but
i
did
like
to
interrupt
the
story
helen
sprang
to
her
feet
her
cheeks
blanched
for
a
few
seconds
became
rosy
red
you
she
cried
how
dare
you
follow
me
here
in
the
rapidly
growing
light
she
caught
a
transitory
gleam
in
the
american
eyes
though
his
face
was
as
impassive
as
usual
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
it
suggested
humor
not
resentment
even
in
the
tumult
of
wounded
pride
that
took
her
heart
by
storm
she
realized
that
her
fiery
vehemence
had
gone
perilously
near
to
a
literal
translation
of
the
saintly
scoff
at
old
barbariccia
and
now
if
ever
she
must
be
dignified
anger
yielded
to
disdain
in
an
instant
she
grew
cold
and
self
collected
i
regret
that
in
my
surprise
i
spoke
unguardedly
she
said
of
course
this
hut
is
open
to
everyone
judging
by
the
look
of
things
between
here
and
the
hotel
we
shall
not
be
worried
by
a
crowd
broke
in
spencer
i
meant
to
arrive
half
an
hour
earlier
but
that
slope
on
the
alp
ota
offers
surprising
difficulties
in
the
dark
i
wished
to
say
when
you
interrupted
me
that
i
am
leaving
at
once
so
my
presence
can
make
little
difference
to
you
said
helen
grandly
that
sounds
more
reasonable
than
it
really
is
was
the
quietly
flippant
reply
it
conveys
my
intent
i
have
no
desire
to
prolong
this
conversation
she
cried
rather
more
flurriedly
now
there
i
agree
with
you
we
have
started
on
the
wrong
set
of
rails
it
is
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
coughed
or
fallen
down
the
moraine
or
done
any
old
thing
sooner
than
butt
into
the
talk
so
unexpectedly
if
you
will
allow
me
i
begin
again
right
now
he
turned
to
the
italians
who
were
watching
and
listening
in
curious
silence
trying
to
pick
up
an
odd
word
that
would
help
to
explain
the
relations
between
the
two
will
you
gentlemen
take
an
interest
in
the
scenery
for
five
minutes
he
asked
with
a
smile
though
the
valley
of
the
adda
may
have
lost
its
wine
it
will
never
lose
its
love
of
romance
the
polite
italians
raised
their
hats
and
went
out
helen
drawing
a
long
breath
withdrew
somewhat
into
the
shadow
she
felt
that
she
would
have
more
command
over
herself
if
the
american
could
not
see
her
face
the
ruse
did
not
avail
her
at
all
spencer
crossed
the
floor
of
the
hut
until
he
looked
into
her
eyes
helen
he
said
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
the
tender
reproach
in
his
voice
almost
unnerved
her
but
she
answered
simply
what
else
would
you
have
me
do
once
i
found
out
the
circumstances
under
which
i
came
to
switzerland
it
may
be
that
you
were
not
told
the
truth
who
was
your
informant
mr
bower
none
other
what
then
is
my
pitiful
story
the
property
of
the
hotel
it
is
now
i
took
care
of
that
some
of
the
people
there
had
been
spreading
a
misleading
version
and
it
was
necessary
to
correct
it
the
women
of
course
i
could
not
deal
with
as
the
general
was
an
old
man
i
picked
out
george
de
courcy
vavasour
as
best
fitted
to
digest
the
wrong
edition
i
made
him
eat
it
it
seemed
to
disagree
with
him
but
he
got
through
with
an
effort
helen
felt
that
she
ought
to
decline
further
discussion
but
she
was
tongue
tied
spencer
was
regarding
her
so
fixedly
that
she
began
to
fear
lest
he
might
notice
the
embarrassed
perplexity
that
she
herself
was
quite
conscious
of
will
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
exactly
what
you
mean
she
said
forcing
the
question
mechanically
from
her
lips
that
is
why
i
am
here
i
assure
you
that
subterfuge
can
never
again
exist
between
you
and
me
said
he
earnestly
you
can
accept
my
words
literally
acting
for
himself
and
others
vavasour
wrote
on
paper
the
lying
insinuations
made
by
miss
jaques
and
ate
them
both
words
and
paper
he
happened
to
use
the
thin
glazed
continental
variety
so
what
it
lost
in
bulk
it
gained
in
toughness
he
did
like
it
and
said
so
but
he
had
to
do
it
she
was
nervously
aware
of
a
wish
to
laugh
but
unless
she
gave
way
to
hysteria
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
trying
to
retreat
still
farther
into
the
friendly
shade
she
backed
round
the
inner
end
of
the
table
but
found
the
way
blocked
by
a
rough
bench
something
must
be
said
or
done
to
extricate
herself
the
dread
that
her
voice
might
break
was
becoming
an
obsession
you
speak
of
a
false
version
and
that
implies
a
true
one
she
managed
to
say
constrainedly
how
far
was
bower
statement
false
or
true
i
settled
that
point
too
bower
told
you
the
facts
the
deduction
he
forced
on
you
was
a
lie
to
my
harmless
notion
of
gratifying
a
girl
longing
for
a
holiday
abroad
he
added
the
motive
that
inspired
his
own
journey
i
overheard
your
conversation
with
miss
jaques
in
the
embankment
hotel
i
saw
bower
introduced
to
you
i
saw
him
looking
for
you
in
victoria
station
and
knew
that
he
represented
the
meeting
as
accidental
i
felt
a
certain
responsibility
on
your
account
so
i
followed
by
the
next
train
bower
played
his
cards
so
well
that
i
found
myself
in
a
difficult
position
i
was
busy
guessing
but
was
unable
to
prove
anything
while
the
one
story
i
was
sure
of
was
not
in
the
game
and
then
you
see
he
wanted
to
make
you
his
wife
which
brought
about
the
real
complication
i
have
much
use
for
him
but
i
must
be
fair
and
bower
only
break
was
when
he
misrepresented
my
action
in
subsidizing
firefly
i
do
deny
he
was
pretty
mad
at
the
idea
of
losing
you
and
jealousy
will
often
drive
a
man
to
do
a
mean
thing
which
might
otherwise
be
repugnant
to
his
better
nature
jealousy
shrilled
helen
her
woman
wit
at
last
finding
a
joint
in
his
armor
yet
never
did
woman
err
more
than
she
in
thinking
that
her
american
suitor
would
flinch
beneath
the
shaft
that
is
the
word
was
the
quiet
reply
she
flared
into
indignant
scorn
pray
tell
me
why
he
or
any
other
man
should
feel
jealous
of
you
where
i
am
concerned
she
said
i
am
going
to
tell
you
right
away
helen
but
that
is
the
last
chapter
there
is
quite
a
long
record
as
to
the
way
i
hit
on
your
track
in
moritz
and
heard
of
you
by
telephone
last
night
of
course
that
part
of
the
story
will
keep
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
hear
any
portion
of
it
she
interrupted
hoping
to
irritate
him
and
thus
lessen
the
strain
imposed
by
his
studiously
tranquil
manner
well
it
ought
to
interest
you
but
it
has
humorous
points
to
which
i
ca
do
justice
under
present
conditions
you
are
right
helen
you
most
always
are
the
real
question
at
issue
is
my
position
in
the
deal
which
becomes
quite
clear
when
i
say
that
you
are
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
loved
or
ever
shall
love
more
than
that
you
are
the
only
woman
to
whom
i
have
ever
spoken
a
word
of
love
and
as
i
have
set
about
loving
the
dearest
and
prettiest
and
healthiest
girl
i
have
ever
seen
it
is
safe
to
figure
that
you
will
have
sole
claim
on
all
the
nice
things
i
can
try
to
say
to
any
woman
during
the
remainder
of
my
life
he
hesitated
a
moment
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
that
helen
after
a
rebellious
gasp
or
two
had
suddenly
become
very
still
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
fixed
up
a
finer
bit
of
word
painting
than
that
he
continued
slowly
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
mind
admitting
that
ever
since
eleven
last
night
when
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
below
there
telephoned
to
me
that
miss
trenholme
had
gone
to
the
mortel
hut
with
two
guides
i
have
been
rehearsing
x
plus
y
multiplied
by
z
ways
of
telling
you
just
how
dear
you
are
to
me
but
they
all
vanished
like
smoke
when
i
saw
your
sweet
face
you
tried
to
be
severe
with
me
helen
but
your
voice
ring
true
and
you
are
the
poorest
sort
of
prevaricator
i
know
and
the
reason
those
set
forms
would
work
at
the
right
moment
is
that
they
were
addressed
to
the
silent
air
you
are
near
me
now
my
sweet
you
are
almost
in
my
arms
you
are
in
my
arms
helen
and
it
sounds
just
right
to
keep
on
telling
you
that
i
love
you
now
and
shall
love
you
for
ever
oh
my
dear
my
dear
you
must
never
never
run
away
again
search
the
dictionary
for
all
the
unkindest
things
you
can
say
about
me
but
do
run
away
for
i
know
now
that
when
you
are
absent
the
day
is
night
and
the
night
is
akin
to
death
guide
pietro
was
somewhat
a
philosopher
stamping
about
on
the
tiny
stone
plateau
of
the
hut
to
keep
at
bay
the
cold
mists
from
the
glacier
he
happened
to
glance
through
the
open
door
he
drew
away
instantly
bartelommeo
he
said
to
his
companion
we
shall
not
cross
the
sella
with
our
charming
bartelommeo
was
surprised
he
looked
at
the
clean
cut
crest
of
the
rock
glowing
now
in
vivid
sunlight
argument
was
not
required
he
pointed
silently
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
yes
murmured
pietro
we
could
have
a
better
day
for
the
pass
it
is
not
the
weather
then
what
is
it
asked
bartelommeo
moved
to
speech
she
is
going
the
other
way
did
you
catch
the
tears
in
her
voice
yesterday
she
smiled
at
my
stories
and
carried
herself
bravely
but
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
when
she
was
left
to
her
thoughts
and
again
my
friend
did
you
not
see
her
face
when
the
young
arrived
she
was
frightened
pietro
laughed
softly
a
woman
always
fears
her
lover
he
said
that
is
just
the
reason
why
you
married
caterina
you
liked
her
for
her
shyness
it
made
you
feel
yourself
a
man
a
devil
of
a
fellow
do
you
remember
how
timid
she
was
how
she
tried
to
avoid
you
how
she
would
dodge
into
anybody
chalet
rather
than
meet
you
but
how
do
you
know
demanded
bartelommeo
waking
into
resentful
appreciation
of
pietro
close
acquaintance
with
his
wooing
because
i
married
lola
two
years
earlier
women
are
all
the
same
no
matter
what
country
they
hail
from
nervous
as
young
chamois
before
marriage
but
after
body
of
bacchus
was
it
on
wednesday
that
caterina
hauled
you
out
of
the
albergo
to
chop
firewood
bartelommeo
grunted
and
put
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
again
chapter
xvii
the
settlement
though
helen
was
the
better
linguist
it
was
left
to
spencer
to
explain
that
circumstances
would
prevent
the
lady
from
going
to
malenco
that
day
he
did
not
fully
understand
why
the
men
should
exchange
glances
of
darksome
intelligence
when
he
made
this
statement
he
fancied
they
were
disappointed
at
losing
a
good
customer
so
he
went
on
brokenly
you
are
in
no
hurry
eh
well
then
take
us
across
the
glacier
to
the
aguagliouls
we
should
obtain
a
fine
view
from
the
summit
and
get
back
to
the
hotel
for
luncheon
i
will
pay
the
same
rates
as
for
the
sella
both
guides
were
manifestly
pleased
pietro
began
a
voluble
recital
of
the
glories
that
would
meet
their
enraptured
gaze
from
the
top
of
the
mighty
rock
you
will
see
the
bernina
splendidly
he
cried
and
roseg
too
and
the
glüschaint
and
il
chapütschin
if
the
lady
will
trust
to
us
we
can
bring
her
down
the
tschierva
glacier
safely
you
are
a
climber
else
you
could
never
have
crossed
the
ota
before
dawn
but
let
us
make
another
cup
of
coffee
the
middle
roseg
ice
is
safe
at
any
hour
and
if
we
are
on
the
rock
by
nine
that
will
be
perfect
for
the
sun
already
a
grand
panorama
of
glaciers
and
peaks
was
unfolding
itself
a
cloudless
sky
promised
a
lovely
august
day
and
what
that
means
in
the
high
alps
the
mountaineer
alone
can
tell
but
spencer
turned
his
back
on
the
outer
glory
he
had
eyes
only
for
helen
while
she
looking
mistily
at
the
giant
rock
across
the
valley
saw
it
not
at
all
for
she
was
peering
into
her
own
soul
and
found
the
prospect
dazzling
in
its
pure
delight
so
they
sat
down
to
a
fresh
brew
of
coffee
and
spencer
horrified
helen
by
a
confession
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
previous
evening
her
tender
solicitude
for
his
needs
her
hasty
unpacking
of
rolls
and
sandwiches
her
anxiety
that
he
should
endeavor
to
consume
the
whole
of
the
provisions
intended
for
the
day
march
were
all
sufficing
guerdon
for
the
sufferings
of
those
miserable
days
since
the
hour
when
de
la
vere
told
him
that
helen
had
gone
it
was
a
new
experience
for
spencer
to
have
a
gracious
and
smiling
woman
so
greatly
concerned
for
his
welfare
but
it
was
decidedly
agreeable
these
little
attentions
admitted
so
much
that
she
dared
not
tell
as
yet
and
he
had
such
a
budget
of
news
for
her
though
he
found
it
difficult
to
eat
and
talk
at
the
same
time
he
boldly
made
the
attempt
stampa
was
the
genius
who
really
unraveled
the
mystery
he
said
certainly
i
managed
to
discover
in
the
first
instance
that
you
had
deposited
your
baggage
in
your
own
name
had
all
else
failed
i
should
have
converted
myself
into
a
label
and
stuck
to
your
boxes
till
you
claimed
them
at
basle
but
once
we
ascertained
that
you
had
not
quitted
moritz
by
train
stampa
did
the
rest
he
knows
moritz
like
a
book
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
you
had
changed
your
name
why
i
wonder
she
broke
in
that
is
rather
hard
to
say
he
wrestled
valiantly
with
the
leg
of
a
tough
chicken
and
thus
was
able
to
evade
the
question
poor
stampa
clinging
tenaciously
to
the
belief
that
helen
bore
some
resemblance
to
his
lost
daughter
remembered
that
when
etta
made
her
sorrowful
journey
from
zermatt
she
gave
another
name
at
the
little
hostelry
in
maloja
where
she
ended
her
life
anyhow
went
on
spencer
having
dexterously
severed
the
joint
he
tracked
you
from
moritz
to
the
roseg
he
even
hit
on
the
shop
in
which
you
bought
your
rucksack
and
alpenstock
then
he
put
me
on
to
the
telephone
and
the
remainder
of
the
chase
was
up
to
me
i
am
sorry
now
that
the
dear
old
man
did
not
come
with
you
cried
helen
i
look
on
him
as
the
first
of
my
friends
in
switzerland
and
shall
be
more
than
pleased
to
see
him
again
i
pressed
him
to
come
along
but
he
refused
i
do
wish
to
pain
you
dearest
but
i
guess
he
wants
to
keep
track
of
bower
helen
who
had
no
inkling
of
the
tragedy
that
linked
those
two
blushed
to
her
ears
at
the
recollection
of
her
parting
from
the
millionaire
do
you
do
you
know
that
bower
proposed
to
me
she
stammered
he
told
me
that
and
a
lot
more
did
you
quarrel
we
said
things
but
i
could
treat
bower
as
i
handled
georgie
i
was
forced
to
admit
his
good
taste
you
see
well
dear
promise
me
that
i
slay
him
why
helen
if
he
is
half
the
man
i
take
him
for
he
will
come
to
our
wedding
i
told
de
la
vere
i
should
bring
you
back
and
she
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
color
ebbed
and
flowed
on
helen
face
at
an
alarming
rate
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
she
asked
with
a
calm
severity
that
her
fluttering
heart
denied
spencer
laughed
so
happily
that
pietro
who
understood
no
word
of
what
his
voyageurs
were
saying
gave
bartelommeo
a
sapient
wink
well
now
he
cried
would
we
be
the
queerest
pair
of
zanies
to
go
all
that
long
way
to
london
to
get
married
when
a
parson
and
a
church
and
all
the
needful
consular
offices
are
right
here
under
our
noses
so
to
speak
why
we
have
a
honeymoon
staring
us
in
the
face
we
just
skate
round
switzerland
after
your
baggage
and
then
drop
down
the
map
into
italy
i
figured
it
all
out
last
night
together
with
methods
of
making
the
preliminary
declaration
i
tell
you
the
whole
scheme
while
we
oh
well
if
you
in
a
real
hurry
to
cross
the
glacier
i
must
defer
details
and
talk
in
headlines
for
helen
absolutely
scarlet
now
had
risen
with
a
tragic
air
and
bade
the
guides
prepare
for
instant
departure
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
roseg
and
roping
was
essential
though
pietro
undertook
to
avoid
any
difficult
crevasses
he
led
spencer
followed
with
helen
next
and
bartelommeo
last
they
reached
the
opposite
moraine
in
half
an
hour
and
began
to
climb
steadily
the
rock
which
looked
so
forbidding
from
the
hut
was
by
no
means
steep
and
not
at
all
dangerous
they
had
plenty
of
time
and
often
stopped
to
admire
the
magnificent
vistas
of
the
val
roseg
and
the
bernina
range
that
were
gradually
unfolding
before
their
eyes
soon
they
were
on
a
level
with
the
hut
the
alpine
palace
that
had
permitted
their
first
embrace
when
we
make
our
next
trip
to
moritz
helen
we
must
seek
out
the
finest
and
biggest
photograph
of
the
mortel
that
money
can
buy
said
spencer
helen
was
standing
a
little
above
him
on
a
broad
ledge
her
hand
was
resting
on
his
shoulder
oh
look
she
cried
suddenly
pointing
with
her
alpenstock
to
the
massive
mountain
wall
that
rose
above
the
a
few
stones
had
fallen
above
a
widespread
snow
slope
the
stones
started
an
avalanche
and
the
roar
of
the
tremendous
cascade
of
snow
and
rock
was
distinctly
audible
pietro
uttered
an
exclamation
and
hastily
unslung
a
telescope
he
said
something
in
a
low
tone
to
bartelommeo
but
spencer
and
helen
grasped
its
meaning
the
girl
eyes
dilated
with
terror
there
has
been
an
accident
she
whispered
bartelommeo
took
the
telescope
in
his
turn
and
evidently
agreed
with
the
leading
guide
a
party
has
fallen
on
corvatsch
said
pietro
gravely
two
men
are
clinging
to
a
ledge
it
is
not
a
bad
place
but
they
can
not
move
they
must
be
injured
and
there
may
be
others
below
let
us
go
to
their
assistance
said
spencer
instantly
certo
that
is
the
law
of
the
hills
but
the
what
of
her
she
will
remain
at
the
hut
i
will
do
anything
you
wish
said
helen
sorrowfully
for
her
gladness
had
been
changed
to
mourning
by
the
fearsome
tidings
that
two
if
not
more
human
beings
were
in
imminent
danger
on
the
slopes
of
the
very
hill
that
had
witnessed
the
avowal
of
her
love
they
raced
back
over
the
glacier
doubling
on
their
own
track
and
were
thus
enabled
to
travel
without
precaution
leaving
helen
at
the
hut
the
men
lost
no
time
in
beginning
the
ascent
they
were
gone
so
long
that
she
was
almost
frantic
with
dread
in
their
behalf
but
at
last
they
came
slowly
with
the
tread
of
care
for
they
were
carrying
the
body
of
a
man
while
they
were
yet
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
above
the
hut
spencer
intrusted
the
burden
to
the
italians
alone
he
advanced
with
rapid
strides
and
helen
knew
that
he
brought
bad
news
come
dear
one
he
said
gently
we
must
go
to
the
inn
and
send
help
our
guides
are
bringing
an
injured
man
to
the
hut
and
there
is
one
other
whom
we
left
on
the
mountain
dead
yes
killed
instantly
by
a
stone
that
was
all
just
a
mishap
one
of
the
things
that
can
never
be
avoided
in
climbing
but
come
dear
more
men
are
needed
and
a
doctor
this
poor
fellow
is
badly
hurt
can
i
do
nothing
for
him
she
pleaded
a
species
of
fright
twitched
his
grave
face
for
an
instant
no
no
that
is
not
to
be
thought
of
he
urged
pietro
says
he
has
some
little
skill
in
these
matters
he
can
do
all
that
is
needed
until
a
doctor
arrives
believe
me
helen
it
is
imperative
that
we
should
reach
the
hotel
without
delay
she
went
with
him
at
once
who
is
it
she
asked
he
steeled
himself
to
answer
according
to
his
intent
though
he
had
vowed
that
never
again
would
he
utter
a
syllable
to
his
love
that
was
not
transparently
true
how
could
he
tell
her
then
that
stampa
was
stretched
lifeless
on
the
broad
bosom
of
corvatsch
and
that
the
italians
were
carrying
bower
crushed
and
raving
in
delirium
to
the
hut
an
englishman
and
his
guide
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
his
prepared
reply
the
guide
is
dead
but
his
employer
can
be
saved
i
am
sure
if
only
we
rush
things
a
bit
now
helen
let
us
go
at
top
speed
no
talking
dear
we
must
make
the
hotel
under
the
hour
they
did
it
and
help
was
soon
forthcoming
then
spencer
ordered
a
carriage
and
insisted
that
helen
should
drive
to
maloja
forthwith
he
would
stay
at
roseg
he
said
to
make
certain
that
everything
possible
was
done
for
the
unfortunate
climber
indeed
when
his
beloved
was
lost
to
sight
down
the
winding
road
that
leads
to
the
main
valley
of
the
engadine
he
accompanied
the
men
who
went
to
the
mortel
halfway
they
met
pietro
and
bartelommeo
carrying
bower
on
an
improvised
stretcher
ice
axes
and
a
blanket
by
this
time
under
the
stimulus
of
wine
and
warmth
bower
had
regained
his
senses
he
recognized
spencer
and
tried
to
speak
but
the
american
told
him
that
even
the
least
excitement
must
be
avoided
once
the
hotel
was
reached
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
doctor
bower
could
not
be
restrained
it
was
you
who
rescued
me
he
said
feebly
i
and
two
italian
guides
we
saw
the
accident
from
the
other
side
of
the
roseg
glacier
yes
stampa
pointed
you
out
to
me
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
i
watched
you
till
the
thought
came
that
stampa
had
befooled
me
then
he
pushed
me
off
the
rock
where
we
were
standing
i
broke
my
leg
in
the
fall
but
he
held
me
there
on
the
rope
and
taunted
me
great
god
how
i
suffered
you
really
ought
not
to
talk
about
it
said
spencer
soothingly
why
not
he
brought
me
there
to
kill
me
he
said
the
cunning
old
fox
told
me
that
i
would
find
helen
in
the
mortel
hut
and
offered
to
take
me
to
her
by
a
short
cut
over
corvatsch
and
i
believed
him
i
was
mad
i
suppose
we
did
the
marmoré
ascent
by
the
light
of
the
stars
do
you
realize
what
that
means
it
is
a
hard
climb
for
experts
in
broad
daylight
but
i
meant
to
beat
you
spencer
stampa
vowed
you
were
in
moritz
and
again
i
believed
him
think
of
it
i
was
hoodwinked
by
an
old
peasant
hush
try
and
forget
things
till
your
broken
limb
is
fixed
what
does
it
matter
confound
it
you
won
so
let
me
tell
my
story
i
must
have
lost
my
senses
when
i
saw
you
and
helen
leaving
the
glacier
with
two
strange
guides
i
forgot
all
else
in
my
rage
i
stood
there
frozen
bewitched
stampa
was
watching
me
all
the
time
and
the
instant
i
turned
to
revile
him
he
threw
me
off
my
balance
with
a
thrust
of
his
ax
you
are
going
to
die
marcus
bauer
he
said
grinning
at
me
with
a
lunatic
joy
he
even
gloated
over
the
unexpected
injury
i
received
in
falling
my
groans
and
cries
were
so
pleasing
to
him
that
he
did
not
cut
the
rope
at
once
as
he
meant
to
do
but
kept
me
dangling
there
listening
to
his
reproaches
then
the
stones
fell
and
pinned
him
to
the
ledge
but
not
one
touched
me
and
i
hauled
myself
up
broken
leg
and
all
till
i
crawled
on
to
the
big
rock
that
rested
on
his
body
you
found
me
there
eh
yes
well
i
wish
you
luck
i
meant
to
snatch
helen
from
you
even
at
the
twelfth
hour
but
stampa
me
that
mock
marriage
of
his
contriving
had
more
power
than
i
counted
on
curse
it
how
these
crushed
bones
are
beginning
to
ache
give
me
some
brandy
i
want
to
drink
helen
health
and
my
own
and
yours
damn
you
see
that
you
treat
her
well
and
make
her
life
happy
she
is
worthy
of
all
your
love
and
i
suppose
she
loves
you
whereas
i
might
have
striven
for
years
to
win
her
affection
and
then
failed
in
the
end
late
that
night
spencer
arrived
at
the
maloja
helen
was
waiting
for
him
as
he
had
telephoned
the
hour
he
might
be
expected
rumor
had
brought
the
news
of
stampa
death
and
bower
accident
then
she
understood
why
her
lover
had
sent
her
away
so
quickly
she
was
troubled
all
day
blaming
herself
as
the
unconscious
cause
of
so
much
misery
spencer
saw
that
the
full
truth
alone
would
dispel
her
self
reproach
so
he
told
her
everything
even
showing
her
letter
and
a
telegram
received
from
mackenzie
in
which
the
editor
of
the
firefly
put
it
quite
plainly
that
the
proprietor
of
the
magazine
had
forbidden
him
mackenzie
from
taking
any
steps
whatever
with
regard
to
helen
return
to
england
without
definite
instructions
the
more
she
learned
of
the
amazing
web
of
intrigue
and
misunderstanding
that
surrounded
her
movements
since
she
left
the
embankment
hotel
after
that
memorable
luncheon
with
millicent
the
less
inclined
she
was
to
deny
spencer
theory
that
fate
had
brought
them
together
i
cleared
out
of
colorado
as
though
a
tarantula
had
bitten
me
he
said
i
traveled
five
thousand
miles
to
london
saw
you
fooled
myself
into
the
belief
that
i
was
intended
by
providence
to
play
the
part
of
a
heavy
uncle
and
kept
up
that
notion
during
another
trip
to
this
delightful
country
then
you
began
to
reach
out
for
me
helen
i
did
nothing
of
the
kind
she
protested
oh
yes
you
did
just
grabbed
me
good
and
hard
and
when
bower
showed
up
i
stacked
my
chips
on
the
table
and
sat
down
to
the
game
what
am
i
talking
about
i
do
know
kiss
me
good
night
sweetheart
and
do
you
give
a
red
cent
who
looking
for
once
in
a
way
i
do
mind
admitting
that
i
tired
all
in
i
could
sleep
on
a
row
of
porcupines
stampa
was
buried
in
the
grave
that
held
his
daughter
remains
spencer
purchased
the
space
for
a
suitable
monument
and
the
inscription
does
not
fail
to
record
the
fact
that
one
of
the
men
who
first
conquered
the
matterhorn
had
paid
tribute
to
the
mountains
by
meeting
his
death
on
corvatsch
the
american
went
many
times
to
visit
bower
at
the
roseg
inn
he
found
his
erstwhile
rival
resigned
to
the
vagaries
of
fortune
the
doctors
summoned
from
moritz
deemed
his
case
so
serious
that
they
brought
a
specialist
from
paris
and
the
great
surgeon
announced
that
the
millionaire
leg
would
be
saved
but
there
must
remain
a
permanent
stiffness
i
know
what
that
means
said
bower
with
a
wry
smile
it
is
a
legacy
from
stampa
that
is
really
rather
funny
considering
that
the
joke
is
against
myself
by
the
way
did
i
tell
you
i
gave
millicent
jaques
a
check
for
five
thousand
pounds
to
stop
her
tongue
i
guessed
the
check
but
could
guess
the
amount
she
wrote
last
week
threatening
all
sorts
of
terrible
things
because
i
withheld
payment
you
will
remember
that
when
you
and
i
placed
on
record
our
mutual
opinion
of
each
other
we
agreed
at
any
rate
that
it
was
a
mean
thing
on
her
part
to
give
away
our
poor
helen
to
the
harpies
in
the
hotel
so
i
telegraphed
at
once
to
my
bankers
and
miss
millicent
did
make
good
as
you
would
put
it
now
she
promises
to
me
humorous
is
it
i
think
you
ought
to
marry
her
said
spencer
with
that
immobile
look
of
his
perhaps
i
may
one
of
these
days
but
first
she
must
learn
to
behave
herself
a
nice
girl
millicent
she
would
look
decorative
sitting
beside
an
invalid
in
a
carriage
yes
i
think
of
it
meanwhile
i
shall
chaff
her
about
the
five
thousand
and
see
how
she
takes
it
millicent
behaved
helen
saw
that
she
did
on
a
day
in
september
after
a
wedding
that
was
attended
by
as
many
people
as
could
be
crowded
into
the
little
english
church
at
maloja
and
charles
spencer
drove
over
the
pass
and
down
the
vale
of
bregaglia
en

to
como
milan
and
venice
at

breakfast
when

the

amused
the
guests
by
stating
that
he
had
taken
pains
to
discover
what
the
initial
k
represented
in
his
american
friend
name
his
second
name
is
knox
said
the
vicar
and
i
understand
that
he
is
a
direct
descendant
of
a
famous
scottish
divine
known
to
history
as
a
very
stubborn
person
well
it
has
been
said
by
a
gentleman
present
that
spencer
has
a
backbone
of
cast
steel
so
the
is
fully
accounted
for
while
the
singular
affinity
of
steel
of
any
variety
for
a
magnet
gives
a
ready
explanation
of
the
admirable
union
which
has
resulted
from
the
chance
that
brought
the
bride
and
bridegroom
under
the
same
roof
everybody
said
that
hare
was
much
happier
on
such
occasions
than
in
the
pulpit
and
even
the
wragg
girls
were
heard
to
admit
that
helen
looked
positively
charming
so
it
is
clear
that
many
hatchets
were
blunted
in
maloja
which
is
as
it
should
ever
be
in
such
a
fairyland
and
that
helen
looking
back
at
the
mighty
chain
of
