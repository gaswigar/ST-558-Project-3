the
hour
for
breakfast
at
the
home
of
harrison
townsend
in
worthington
square
was
supposed
to
be
eight
o
clock
in
point
of
fact
however
breakfast
was
usually
served
from
that
hour
on
until
the
last
laggard
had
appeared
the
head
of
the
house
himself
was
always
promptly
on
hand
at
eight
on
the
morning
of
april
second
he
had
as
usual
nearly
finished
his
breakfast
before
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
second
member
of
the
family
townsend
raised
his
eyes
as
a
tall
and
slender
figure
limped
slowly
across
the
floor
morning
murray
he
said
and
dropped
his
eyes
again
to
his
paper
good
morning
sir
responded
his
son
and
glanced
indifferently
over
the
table
as
he
sat
down
bring
me
grapefruit
and
a
cup
of
coffee
he
said
to
the
maid
no
nothing
else
be
sure
the
grapefruit
is
fixed
as
i
like
it
townsend
finished
his
newspaper
and
his
coffee
at
the
same
moment
and
rose
from
the
table
although
five
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
elder
of
his
two
sons
came
into
the
room
no
conversation
had
passed
between
them
townsend
s
glance
dropped
upon
the
young
man
who
with
his
look
of
ill
health
would
have
appeared
to
a
stranger
to
have
lived
several
more
than
the
years
which
were
really
his
you
re
not
feeling
well
this
morning
murray
about
as
usual
it
s
not
strange
that
you
have
no
strength
when
you
take
nothing
substantial
with
your
morning
meal
how
can
i
when
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
anything
but
fruit
you
don
t
get
out
enough
i
suppose
i
don
t
there
s
nothing
to
take
me
out
townsend
turned
away
as
he
passed
through
the
door
he
met
his
daughter
olive
and
greeted
her
this
very
pretty
girl
of
eighteen
evidently
had
been
keeping
late
hours
on
the
previous
evening
her
long
lashes
drooped
sleepily
over
her
eyes
as
she
nodded
to
her
brother
grapefruit
any
good
she
asked
fair
if
it
wasn
t
sweetened
like
a
bonbon
i
like
mine
sweet
annie
tell
gretchen
to
put
half
a
dozen
maraschino
cherries
in
my
grapefruit
and
some
crushed
ice
you
must
like
the
mess
that
will
be
murray
observed
i
do
very
much
replied
his
sister
decidedly
the
two
continued
their
breakfast
in
silence
which
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
advent
of
a
fourth
member
of
the
family
forrest
townsend
flinging
into
the
room
with
a
rush
dressed
in
riding
clothes
and
casting
hat
and
crop
upon
a
chair
as
he
passed
it
offered
a
picturesque
contrast
to
the
two
young
persons
of
a
little
more
than
medium
height
strongly
built
and
he
looked
the
young
athlete
that
he
was
hello
was
his
morning
greeting
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
he
proceeded
instantly
to
give
his
directions
to
the
maid
no
invalid
order
was
his
no
no
grapefruit
i
want
my
chop
and
some
bacon
and
eggs
tell
gretchen
to
brown
the
eggs
better
than
she
did
yesterday
muffins
this
morning
what
oh
bother
you
know
i
hate
toast
annie
oh
waffles
that
s
better
coffee
of
course
sounds
like
an
order
you
d
give
at
a
hotel
observed
his
sister
with
scorn
i
wonder
gretchen
does
n
t
make
a
fuss
at
having
to
cook
a
whole
breakfast
like
that
just
for
you
nobody
else
wants
such
a
heavy
meal
at
this
hour
the
bigger
geese
you
all
are
then
if
i
picked
at
my
breakfast
the
way
the
rest
of
you
do
i
d
soon
lose
this
good
muscle
and
wind
of
mine
i
never
heard
that
hot
waffles
and
syrup
were
good
for
muscle
and
wind
murray
looked
cynical
under
his
dark
eyebrows
they
would
n
t
be
allowed
at
any
forrest
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
his
brother
a
lot
you
know
about
training
tables
a
fellow
who
spent
his
two
college
years
cramming
for
honours
he
said
pointedly
no
wonder
you
look
like
a
pale
ghost
on
such
rations
here
comes
mother
at
last
harrison
townsend
in
a
trailing
pale
blue
gown
her
fair
hair
piled
high
upon
her
head
came
in
with
an
air
of
abstraction
out
late
last
night
forrest
asked
her
attacking
his
chop
with
relish
a
dissipated
lot
you
all
look
but
me
even
murray
would
be
taken
for
a
chap
that
got
in
toward
morning
that
comes
of
reading
in
bed
now
look
at
me
i
was
in
after
the
last
of
you
and
i
m
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
for
a
boy
not
out
of
his
teens
your
hours
strike
me
as
peculiar
murray
rose
slowly
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
at
his
mother
she
was
busy
with
letters
she
had
found
at
her
plate
murray
limped
slowly
over
to
the
end
of
the
room
where
a
great
alcove
filled
with
windows
a
cushioned
seat
running
round
its
whole
extent
looked
out
upon
the
shrubbery
and
the
street
beyond
he
sank
down
upon
this
seat
and
gazed
indifferently
out
of
the
window
across
the
narrow
side
street
which
led
away
from
stately
worthington
square
into
a
much
less
pretentious
neighborhood
stood
a
big
furniture
van
unloading
its
contents
before
a
small
brown
house
although
upon
the
left
side
of
the
townsend
place
lay
a
fine
stretch
of
lawn
at
the
right
the
house
stood
not
more
than
ten
yards
away
from
the
side
street
its
present
owner
had
attempted
to
remedy
this
misfortune
of
site
by
planting
a
thick
hedge
and
much
shrubbery
but
a
narrow
vista
remained
through
which
from
the
windows
the
little
brown
house
opposite
could
be
seen
with
the
effect
of
being
viewed
through
a
and
brought
into
close
range
what
s
that
over
there
in
gay
street
olive
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
new
people
moving
in
goodness
how
many
tenants
has
that
house
had
they
re
always
moving
out
and
moving
in
nobody
can
keep
track
of
them
townsend
looking
up
from
her
letter
glanced
out
in
her
turn
there
is
certainly
no
need
to
keep
track
of
them
she
observed
what
your
grandfather
townsend
could
have
been
thinking
of
when
he
built
this
house
on
the
very
edge
of
such
a
fine
lot
grandfather
townsend
was
a
shrewd
old
man
and
had
an
eye
to
the
sale
of
lots
on
the
farther
side
of
the
house
when
land
got
high
here
was
forrest
s
explanation
five
minutes
later
he
was
out
of
the
house
and
crossing
the
lawn
to
the
stables
a
gay
and
gallant
young
figure
in
his
riding
clothes
from
the
window
of
his
own
room
upstairs
murray
watched
his
brother
go
feeling
bitterly
as
he
often
did
the
contrast
between
forrest
s
superb
young
health
and
his
own
crippled
condition
the
result
of
an
accident
two
years
before
and
the
illness
which
had
followed
it
don
t
get
outdoors
enough
he
said
to
himself
i
fancy
if
i
could
go
tearing
out
of
the
house
like
that
every
morning
jump
on
bluebottle
and
gallop
off
down
frankfort
boulevard
i
could
get
outdoor
air
enough
to
keep
me
healthy
an
hour
afterward
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
and
a
child
s
voice
called
o
murray
may
i
come
in
his
sister
shirley
somehow
seemed
nearer
to
murray
than
any
other
member
of
his
family
come
in
he
responded
o
murray
the
little
sister
began
instantly
some
new
people
are
moving
into
the
little
brown
house
and
there
s
a
girl
just
my
age
she
looks
so
nice
i
ve
been
watching
her
she
s
helping
wash
windows
oh
please
come
into
the
den
and
let
me
show
you
from
the
den
it
could
all
be
seen
there
were
two
girls
on
the
small
porch
each
washing
a
window
the
elder
girl
looked
as
if
she
were
about
eighteen
her
abundant
curly
hair
of
a
decided
reddish
brown
being
worn
low
at
her
neck
after
the
fashion
of
girls
of
that
age
even
across
the
street
the
observers
could
see
that
she
had
a
merry
face
full
of
life
and
colour
the
younger
girl
was
about
shirley
s
size
and
sturdy
and
apparently
of
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
for
having
accidentally
tipped
over
her
pail
she
took
the
mishap
in
the
jolliest
spirit
and
throwing
back
her
thick
brown
braids
of
hair
mopped
up
the
swimming
porch
with
lively
flourishes
i
wish
we
could
see
em
closer
suggested
shirley
they
look
so
nice
don
t
you
think
they
do
not
a
bit
like
the
other
people
that
have
lived
in
that
house
i
saw
their
mother
i
m
sure
i
did
a
little
while
ago
she
had
the
dearest
face
murray
don
t
you
think
you
d
like
to
take
a
little
walk
it
would
be
such
fun
to
go
past
the
house
while
they
re
out
there
and
they
d
be
sure
to
turn
and
look
so
we
could
see
their
faces
please
murray
we
may
not
have
so
good
a
chance
after
they
get
the
windows
washed
it
was
something
to
do
certainly
motives
of
interest
for
the
daily
walk
upon
which
the
doctors
insisted
were
few
and
the
older
brother
gladly
followed
his
anxious
young
leader
out
into
the
spring
sunshine
slowly
murray
s
cane
tapping
their
advance
they
turned
the
corner
from
worthington
square
into
gay
street
coming
rapidly
toward
them
from
the
opposite
direction
was
a
young
fellow
of
about
murray
s
age
this
youth
looking
toward
the
brown
house
gave
a
low
whistle
the
girls
upon
the
porch
turned
and
waved
their
cloths
and
the
newcomer
making
three
leaps
of
the
short
path
to
the
house
and
one
jump
of
the
low
porch
was
with
them
they
did
not
shout
those
three
and
the
elder
girl
s
voice
murray
noted
was
delightfully
modulated
but
he
and
shirley
were
close
now
and
they
could
not
help
hearing
the
greeting
hard
at
it
already
everything
come
i
got
off
for
an
hour
and
thought
i
d
rush
up
and
do
what
i
could
that
was
lovely
of
you
pete
said
the
elder
girl
a
surreptitious
glance
from
murray
and
a
frank
stare
from
shirley
proved
her
to
possess
a
very
attractive
face
indeed
as
she
smiled
at
the
stoutly
built
young
man
before
her
yes
everything
has
come
and
mother
can
keep
you
busy
every
minute
would
n
t
to
come
first
but
we
thought
we
d
get
at
least
this
little
front
room
in
order
by
night
so
that
when
you
all
came
home
her
voice
was
growing
indistinct
as
the
moved
reluctantly
on
but
the
younger
girl
at
this
point
broke
in
and
her
voice
high
and
eager
like
shirley
s
own
carried
farther
o
petey
jane
and
i
are
to
have
the
dearest
littlest
room
you
ever
saw
right
under
the
eaves
jane
can
t
stand
up
all
over
but
i
can
except
close
to
the
wall
it
s
so
little
jane
thinks
we
can
paper
it
ourselves
if
we
can
only
here
the
deeper
voice
of
the
youth
interrupted
and
nothing
more
was
distinguishable
murray
and
shirley
walked
on
both
it
must
be
confessed
wishing
they
had
eyes
in
the
backs
of
their
heads
oh
do
let
s
turn
and
go
back
begged
shirley
with
one
quick
glance
behind
but
murray
made
her
keep
on
to
the
corner
and
then
insisted
on
crossing
the
street
even
now
they
may
guess
that
we
re
watching
them
he
said
don
t
stare
so
at
them
child
but
they
re
going
in
oh
look
she
clutched
his
arm
there
s
the
mother
i
m
sure
she
is
look
isn
t
she
dear
she
did
look
dear
she
was
enveloped
in
an
apron
and
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
to
the
elbows
revealing
a
pair
of
round
white
capable
arms
her
abundant
gray
hair
rolled
and
puffed
about
her
face
in
a
most
girlish
fashion
her
bright
dark
eyes
were
set
under
arching
eyebrows
and
her
face
almost
as
fresh
in
colouring
as
her
daughter
s
was
full
of
charm
the
young
man
laughing
put
an
arm
about
her
shoulders
and
drew
her
back
with
him
into
the
house
the
two
girls
gathering
up
their
pails
and
cloths
and
exchanging
low
gay
talk
followed
and
the
door
was
closed
the
april
sunshine
suddenly
faded
out
of
the
narrow
side
street
and
left
it
as
commonplace
as
ever
yet
not
quite
murray
and
shirley
gazing
across
at
the
dull
little
brown
house
were
longing
to
enter
it
it
was
quite
evident
that
life
of
a
sort
they
hardly
knew
was
about
to
be
lived
within
with
this
new
interest
to
stimulate
him
it
was
perhaps
not
strange
that
murray
should
have
found
it
rather
easier
than
usual
to
get
out
for
his
afternoon
walk
or
that
it
should
have
ended
by
a
slow
progress
through
gay
street
there
were
somehow
so
few
young
people
he
cared
for
and
the
faces
of
the
three
he
had
seen
had
struck
him
as
so
interesting
that
he
wondered
as
he
tapped
along
with
his
cane
by
what
means
he
could
learn
to
know
them
just
as
murray
came
along
the
street
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
he
had
seen
opened
the
door
and
holding
it
ajar
addressed
somebody
inside
in
her
childishly
penetrating
voice
i
m
going
to
find
a
telephone
somewhere
janey
if
i
have
to
ring
at
every
door
no
i
ll
them
we
are
n
t
the
sort
of
people
who
borrow
molasses
and
telephones
and
things
all
the
time
but
why
i
ll
say
it
s
important
would
understand
about
not
coming
and
the
man
waiting
no
i
don
t
suppose
they
have
in
such
a
little
house
but
it
won
t
do
any
harm
to
ask
of
course
across
the
street
they
d
have
but
i
don
t
quite
no
of
course
i
won
t
but
she
ended
an
interview
which
evidently
was
not
proceeding
according
to
her
satisfaction
by
closing
the
door
and
running
down
the
steps
into
the
street
murray
wanted
very
much
to
speak
to
her
and
offer
the
use
of
his
telephone
but
she
whisked
away
so
fast
he
had
no
time
he
walked
more
slowly
than
ever
saw
her
turn
away
from
two
gay
street
doors
and
then
retraced
his
steps
and
met
her
as
she
was
preparing
to
ascend
the
third
small
porch
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
but
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
something
about
needing
to
use
a
telephone
won
t
you
please
come
over
and
use
ours
the
house
on
the
corner
oh
thank
you
she
looked
relieved
that
s
good
of
you
we
hate
to
bother
anybody
like
this
and
jane
my
sister
did
n
t
want
me
to
but
the
paper
man
is
waiting
and
he
s
getting
very
cross
and
we
do
want
to
get
the
done
before
night
i
ll
go
and
tell
jane
she
ll
have
to
telephone
i
can
t
i
don
t
know
how
she
ran
into
the
house
and
a
moment
later
the
elder
sister
emerged
and
came
down
to
murray
to
accept
his
courtesy
it
s
very
kind
of
you
she
said
as
he
accompanied
her
across
the
street
and
in
at
the
hedge
gate
happens
to
be
a
legal
holiday
you
know
and
the
paperer
says
if
he
does
n
t
have
the
right
paper
this
afternoon
it
will
be
three
days
before
he
can
finish
that
would
be
an
awful
bother
murray
declared
just
as
you
re
getting
settled
i
m
glad
we
re
so
near
come
in
this
way
please
take
this
chair
here
by
the
desk
i
ll
just
wait
in
the
hall
and
show
you
the
way
out
as
he
waited
murray
could
not
help
hearing
the
business
did
not
seem
to
be
easily
accomplished
when
his
visitor
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
paper
house
on
the
telephone
she
had
a
very
bad
time
making
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
understand
about
the
mistake
in
the
paper
and
when
it
became
plain
that
he
did
understand
jane
s
surprised
little
sentences
showed
that
he
was
a
most
unaccommodating
person
and
would
not
do
what
she
requested
you
can
t
do
it
she
asked
and
murray
observed
that
with
all
the
trouble
she
was
having
her
voice
did
not
lose
its
courteous
intonations
not
this
afternoon
we
are
very
anxious
to
get
the
room
settled
and
the
paperer
says
yes
i
know
but
it
surely
was
n
t
our
mistake
i
beg
your
pardon
it
s
only
three
o
clock
i
think
not
four
he
says
there
s
plenty
of
time
if
no
i
ve
nobody
to
send
look
here
murray
s
disgusted
voice
was
at
her
ear
he
was
gently
attempting
to
take
the
receiver
away
from
her
let
me
tackle
that
person
please
the
next
moment
jane
was
standing
beside
the
desk
her
cheeks
rosy
with
a
quite
reasonable
indignation
at
the
treatment
she
had
been
receiving
from
the
surly
unknown
at
the
telephone
sat
her
new
acquaintance
sending
rapid
requests
over
the
wire
in
a
tone
which
plainly
was
making
somebody
attend
not
fix
up
your
own
mistake
with
a
holiday
why
not
there
s
plenty
of
time
send
by
a
special
messenger
of
course
and
tell
him
to
be
quick
who
s
talking
to
you
that
does
n
t
make
any
special
difference
does
it
it
may
be
a
small
order
i
don
t
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
bell
needs
that
paper
up
within
half
an
hour
yes
well
this
is
harrison
townsend
s
house
worthington
square
and
i
m
telephoning
for
our
friends
what
oh
you
will
well
thank
you
i
m
glad
you
see
your
way
clear
yes
half
an
hour
i
say
make
it
twenty
minutes
can
t
you
please
very
well
and
murray
broke
off
and
hung
up
the
receiver
with
an
impatient
click
which
expressed
his
contempt
for
a
clerk
who
would
hurry
up
an
order
for
worthington
square
when
he
would
n
t
do
it
for
gay
street
idiot
he
remarked
the
girl
beside
him
moved
toward
the
door
smiling
it
was
ever
so
kind
of
you
she
said
the
paper
is
for
the
and
you
can
guess
how
it
upsets
things
to
have
the
in
confusion
i
hope
you
didn
t
mind
my
telling
that
fellow
you
were
our
friends
said
murray
as
he
accompanied
his
guest
to
the
door
such
near
neighbours
oh
i
understood
that
was
what
made
it
so
easy
for
him
to
get
a
messenger
only
please
don
t
think
we
yes
murray
was
smiling
encouragingly
at
her
it
sounds
absurd
but
it
s
so
dreadfully
soon
to
be
borrowing
telephones
or
molasses
they
both
laughed
murray
s
hand
lingered
upon
the
door
knob
which
at
this
moment
it
became
timely
for
him
to
turn
for
her
i
could
n
t
help
hearing
your
sister
assuring
you
that
she
would
tell
people
you
never
borrowed
molasses
i
don
t
see
why
not
we
might
need
to
borrow
it
of
you
some
time
but
of
course
if
you
feel
there
s
something
especially
prohibitive
about
molasses
he
knew
he
was
not
saying
anything
brilliant
but
it
made
her
laugh
again
and
laughing
is
an
excellent
way
of
getting
over
a
trying
situation
but
he
was
obliged
to
open
the
door
for
her
without
delay
for
she
plainly
was
not
going
to
be
tempted
into
lingering
she
ran
down
the
steps
and
he
saw
her
hair
catch
the
sunshine
as
she
went
as
she
reached
the
bottom
he
called
after
her
i
hope
you
ll
like
that
paper
mighty
well
when
it
s
on
thank
you
he
heard
her
answer
over
her
shoulder
and
he
was
sure
that
she
was
still
smiling
it
seemed
to
him
reasonably
certain
that
the
bells
were
pleasant
people
to
know
chapter

down

tramp
upon
the
little
porch
peter
flung
the
door
wide
and
in
marched
the
four
male
members
of
the
house
of
bell
the
door
opened
hospitably
at
once
into
the
so
that
the
four
were
able
at
a
glance
to
see
what
had
been
accomplished
and
they
immediately
gave
voice
to
their
surprise
hi
this
was
rufus
s
exclamation
hi
hi
hip
hip
well
well
they
must
have
worked
said
peter
i
was
up
here
an
hour
this
morning
and
they
had
n
t
got
further
than
washing
the
windows
when
it
comes
to
hustling
work
mother
bell
and
corps
can
t
be
beaten
declared
ross
mcandrew
the
cousin
of
the
bells
a
lad
of
eighteen
there
was
a
rush
from
the
rear
of
the
house
and
nancy
was
upon
them
nancy
the
with
the
thick
brown
braids
and
the
round
bright
face
ross
caught
her
and
swung
her
up
to
his
shoulder
where
she
struggled
frantically
i
m
too
old
ross
she
pleaded
rumpling
his
curly
fair
hair
in
revenge
until
it
stood
on
end
put
me
down
put
me
down
at
once
you
re
bumping
my
head
against
the
ceiling
he
looked
up
and
laughing
swung
her
gently
down
it
is
n
t
a
very
lofty
apartment
is
it
nan
did
it
hurt
only
my
feelings
does
n
t
it
look
nice
here
mother
worked
at
the
kitchen
and
jane
and
i
did
all
this
we
wanted
it
to
look
like
home
when
you
came
it
does
indeed
but
i
must
admit
i
m
glad
mother
kept
at
the
kitchen
laughed
her
father
with
a
tweak
of
one
fat
braid
it
seems
too
much
to
expect
that
we
should
have
a
meal
in
all
the
disorder
but
peter
brought
back
word
this
morning
that
we
were
to
come
indeed
you
are
said
a
voice
from
an
inner
doorway
and
everybody
turned
a
fresh
white
apron
tied
about
her
trim
waist
where
did
she
find
it
in
the
confusion
her
beautiful
hair
in
careful
order
bell
beamed
at
her
big
family
we
ve
nothing
but
an
irish
stew
for
you
but
we
had
it
on
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
fire
was
built
and
it
s
tender
and
fine
good
for
you
we
like
nothing
better
where
s
janey
in
the
kitchen
trying
to
make
places
for
you
all
at
the
kitchen
table
we
could
n
t
do
anything
with
the
the
paperer
has
only
just
gone
come
on
you
people
called
a
blithe
voice
from
the
next
room
and
jane
s
face
looked
over
her
mother
s
shoulder
turn
to
the
right
as
you
come
through
the
door
and
follow
the
wall
round
i
ve
made
a
passage
that
way
but
you
re
likely
to
get
into
perilous
places
if
you
try
to
steer
for
yourselves
in
single
file
they
followed
directions
all
but
young
rufus
who
preferred
leaping
from
box
to
barrel
and
from
table
to
trunk
and
so
reached
the
haven
of
the
kitchen
first
he
ejaculated
say
but
this
is
jolly
smell
that
stew
hope
you
ve
lots
of
it
all
you
can
eat
responded
jane
confidently
now
if
you
ll
let
me
seat
you
all
i
ll
make
a
place
for
every
one
mother
to
go
first
at
the
other
end
in
the
chair
our
only
one
available
as
yet
next
ross
on
the
and
nan
on
the
daddy
s
to
have
this
all
to
himself
with
a
cushion
on
it
peter
can
sit
on
that
turned
upside
down
there
was
a
roar
at
this
and
a
protest
from
peter
can
t
i
have
a
newspaper
to
pad
the
top
of
it
sis
if
you
will
find
one
jane
responded
unmoved
rufe
will
have
to
take
the
top
of
that
and
we
ll
hand
up
his
things
bell
was
a
famous
cook
and
understood
well
the
quantity
of
food
necessary
to
appease
the
keen
appetites
of
her
big
family
so
the
bowls
were
replenished
again
and
again
until
all
were
satisfied
and
still
the
kettle
was
not
quite
empty
you
re
not
much
like
a
girl
i
saw
janey
remarked
peter
balancing
himself
in
the
attempt
to
sit
comfortably
back
upon
his
while
his
sister
removed
the
plates
and
set
forth
a
dish
of
baked
apples
and
cream
peter
laughed
at
the
recollection
she
was
too
stately
and
languid
to
lift
her
eyes
to
look
at
me
after
the
first
frosty
glance
we
rode
up
town
on
the
same
street
car
yesterday
when
i
was
coming
here
to
make
sure
the
house
was
ready
for
us
it
was
the
rush
hour
of
course
and
i
gave
her
my
seat
i
think
yes
i
really
think
peter
paused
to
reflect
she
said
thank
you
though
since
of
course
i
was
n
t
looking
at
her
as
i
took
off
my
hat
i
did
n
t
see
her
lips
move
she
and
i
got
off
the
car
together
and
came
up
gay
street
together
illustration
you
re
not
much
like
a
girl
i
saw
today
janey
together
from
jane
on
opposite
sides
of
the
street
she
was
a
little
ahead
for
the
car
stopped
on
her
side
i
looked
across
at
her
with
interest
as
i
came
along
wanted
to
find
out
what
our
neighbors
were
like
you
know
she
was
carrying
a
big
muff
and
had
some
things
in
it
been
shopping
of
course
oh
i
don
t
mean
parcels
she
would
n
t
be
caught
carrying
a
parcel
but
letters
and
a
purse
and
a
and
a
and
so
forth
well
as
we
came
along
i
noticed
she
had
dropped
something
handkerchief
by
the
way
it
fluttered
down
of
course
i
bolted
across
the
street
through
six
inches
of
spring
mud
grasped
the
article
and
rushed
after
her
i
said
pardon
me
but
you
dropped
your
handkerchief
and
held
it
out
she
took
it
murmured
thank
you
i
saw
her
lips
move
this
time
and
sailed
on
like
a
queen
i
took
off
my
hat
waded
back
through
the
mud
and
was
continuing
on
my
thankless
way
thankless
i
thought
you
just
admitted
she
thanked
you
objected
ross
with
a
twinkle
it
was
one
of
those
thankless
just
the
same
explained
peter
with
gravity
well
as
i
say
i
went
on
like
this
story
meditating
upon
her
cordial
manner
when
i
saw
something
else
fall
from
the
capacious
muff
you
didn
t
jane
looked
incredulous
pardon
me
i
did
this
time
i
did
not
bolt
across
the
street
indeed
i
stopped
to
consider
whether
i
should
not
shout
hi
hi
there
you
ve
dropped
your
purse
lady
like
a
street
gamin
but
reflecting
on
the
embarrassment
this
might
cause
me
at
some
future
date
when
she
and
i
should
really
meet
i
picked
my
way
across
again
seized
the
pocketbook
and
was
about
to
pursue
her
when
she
looked
round
and
caught
me
in
the
act
of
scrutinizing
it
as
one
naturally
does
upon
picking
up
a
aristocratic
affair
like
that
the
like
of
which
he
expects
never
oh
go
on
rufus
could
no
longer
endure
his
brother
s
tantalising
eloquence
i
hastened
to
her
side
continued
peter
who
was
gifted
in
the
art
of
putting
things
elaborately
when
he
chose
and
remarked
i
believe
this
is
yours
she
now
what
friends
would
you
naturally
expect
a
girl
to
do
on
receiving
the
third
favour
from
a
stranger
within
fifteen
minutes
what
did
you
expect
did
you
suppose
she
would
fly
into
your
did
you
want
her
to
open
the
pocketbook
and
hand
you
a
quarter
saying
here
my
honest
lad
think
she
d
say
you
must
call
and
see
father
he
will
give
you
a
position
in
his
your
suggestions
are
and
improbable
i
expected
none
of
these
things
to
happen
but
consider
the
situation
here
was
i
crossing
the
street
for
the
third
time
in
the
mud
go
on
would
n
t
you
have
thought
considering
the
absurdity
of
the
affair
her
strewing
things
along
the
street
like
that
the
least
she
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
smile
supplied
jane
n
she
peter
she
did
not
avowed
peter
she
just
looked
at
me
as
if
she
thought
i
had
been
about
to
steal
her
purse
took
it
and
went
on
this
time
without
saying
thank
you
good
gracious
this
from
ross
she
must
be
a
nice
girl
to
know
and
you
look
pretty
well
too
pete
in
that
blue
suit
where
does
she
live
nancy
inquired
her
round
face
sympathetic
with
peter
s
mock
humiliation
in
the
big
house
across
the
street
if
you
get
out
of
milk
or
eggs
janey
don
t
hesitate
to
run
across
and
borrow
some
counselled
peter
now
if
you
ll
just
make
use
of
us
all
this
evening
proposed
bell
rising
we
can
accomplish
a
good
deal
eh
boys
shall
i
open
the
boxes
and
barrels
martha
at
this
suggestion
three
more
pairs
of
strong
arms
were
put
at
bell
s
service
she
set
every
one
at
work
at
once
yes
joe
dear
she
agreed
if
you
will
open
the
boxes
i
ll
take
out
the
things
and
put
them
in
place
as
far
as
i
can
that
s
right
nancy
you
help
jane
with
the
dishes
and
when
they
are
done
you
can
go
up
stairs
and
make
up
the
beds
ross
and
peter
yes
we
ll
set
up
the
beds
said
peter
with
alacrity
anticipating
the
division
of
work
and
uncrate
the
chests
of
drawers
and
the
bedroom
furniture
generally
come
on
ross
you
re
as
much
one
of
the
family
as
any
of
us
now
since
you
helped
us
move
and
a
little
family
labour
like
this
will
complete
the
job
whoever
lives
with
us
has
to
learn
to
be
handy
man
about
the
house
i
m
ready
ross
looked
it
there
was
an
air
of
alertness
about
him
for
he
was
slimmer
and
lighter
than
peter
and
his
fair
curly
hair
made
him
appear
much
younger
although
only
two
years
separated
the
ages
of
the
cousins
you
will
find
the
furniture
mostly
in
the
rooms
where
it
belongs
bell
called
after
them
jane
will
be
up
soon
and
straighten
you
out
if
you
get
mixed
rufus
suppose
you
go
round
after
the
others
and
bring
away
all
the
litter
they
leave
after
the
uncrating
and
make
a
neat
pile
of
it
in
the
the
steep
and
narrow
little
staircase
ascended
abruptly
between
walls
from
the
and
led
to
regions
above
which
to
the
eyes
of
murray
and
shirley
townsend
from
the
big
house
across
the
street
facing
worthington
square
would
have
seemed
too
cramped
and
small
of
dimensions
to
be
habitable
to
say
nothing
of
the
possibility
of
their
ever
being
made
comfortable
but
the
bells
were
of
the
sort
who
make
the
best
of
everything
and
so
far
none
of
them
had
suggested
that
the
little
house
was
not
an
abode
fit
for
the
finest
jane
and
nan
in
one
room
rufe
and
i
in
another
and
ross
mcandrew
alone
in
state
in
this
little
one
in
the
corner
i
judge
by
the
signs
that
s
the
stowing
of
the
crowd
intended
speculated
peter
surveying
each
room
in
turn
that
corner
room
s
as
big
as
any
i
don
t
think
i
ought
to
have
it
all
to
myself
objected
ross
what
not
that
spacious
apartment
with
one
whole
side
under
the
eaves
laughed
peter
well
since
we
can
t
split
ourselves
into
halves
and
like
the
family
of
the
famous
poem
we
are
seven
i
don
t
see
but
you
ll
have
to
make
the
best
of
your
loneliness
the
beds
are
only
size
and
rufe
takes
up
less
room
than
you
do
so
he
and
i
naturally
chum
it
all
right
let
s
make
a
start
catch
hold
of
that
bureau
and
heave
it
around
into
place
they
fell
to
work
with
a
will
ross
the
more
lightly
built
showed
the
greater
energy
of
the
two
though
peter
worked
away
quite
as
steadily
but
after
an
hour
of
hard
labour
peter
called
a
halt
oh
let
s
put
it
through
and
ross
bent
over
a
box
with
undiminished
ardour
his
attitude
appealed
to
peter
spoiling
for
fun
after
a
long
day
at
the
factory
and
in
a
twinkling
he
had
tipped
his
cousin
head
first
into
the
nearly
empty
box
shouts
laughter
and
a
lively
scuffle
ensued
so
lively
a
scuffle
indeed
that
bell
jane
and
nancy
in
the
below
energetically
sweeping
up
the
litter
made
by
the
paperer
smiled
at
one
another
in
mock
dismay
as
the
floor
above
resounded
with
the
pounding
and
scraping
of
and
the
very
walls
of
the
small
house
trembled
with
the
fray
goodness
i
should
think
it
was
elephants
up
there
cried
nancy
and
ran
up
the
stairs
to
see
what
was
going
on
bell
opened
his
mouth
to
say
tell
them
it
s
an
old
house
nan
and
the
ceiling
s
cracked
when
the
thing
happened
the
ceiling
was
old
the
house
was
not
too
solidly
built
and
the
battle
above
had
reached
its
height
when
quite
without
warning
down
upon
the
freshly
cleaned
floor
fell
a
great
mass
of
plaster
the
powdery
lime
rose
in
a
suffocating
cloud
and
covered
jane
and
her
father
with
dust
and
debris
it
was
a
minute
more
before
the
combatants
wrestling
furiously
over
the
bare
floors
above
could
be
made
to
understand
by
a
horrified
young
person
who
shrieked
the
news
at
them
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
the
havoc
they
had
wrought
but
when
they
comprehended
what
had
happened
they
hurried
downstairs
well
of
all
the
ross
was
too
shocked
to
finish
i
say
but
we
ve
done
it
now
have
n
t
we
exclaimed
peter
in
disgust
janey
dad
it
did
n
t
hurt
you
did
it
only
my
pride
and
my
hair
answered
jane
as
she
vainly
tried
to
brush
her
curly
locks
free
from
plaster
it
s
a
shame
why
didn
t
you
stop
us
clumsy
louts
pulling
the
place
down
about
our
ears
the
very
first
night
and
how
we
hurried
that
paper
man
to
get
him
through
lamented
nancy
brushing
off
her
father
with
anxious
fingers
we
were
going
to
have
the
all
settled
and
s
a
holiday
murmured
jane
from
under
her
hair
she
was
bending
forward
with
her
head
at
her
knees
while
bell
shook
out
the
clinging
lumps
from
the
tangle
of
hair
in
which
they
were
caught
it
s
a
quarter
of
ten
announced
rufus
cheerfully
do
we
have
to
clear
this
up
i
should
say
so
ross
caught
up
a
broom
it
s
the
least
we
can
do
get
a
box
will
you
rufe
and
let
s
have
the
worst
over
pete
and
i
will
do
the
job
and
the
rest
of
you
can
go
upstairs
and
dance
a
hornpipe
over
our
heads
if
you
will
throw
things
at
us
from
time
to
time
down
the
stairs
it
may
relieve
your
feelings
don
t
feel
too
badly
i
had
a
notion
all
the
time
that
that
ceiling
ought
to
have
been
pulled
down
before
we
papered
the
room
it
looked
old
and
shaky
to
me
now
we
ll
have
a
new
one
that
will
stand
as
long
as
we
live
here
said
bell
smiling
at
the
rueful
countenance
of
her
nephew
right
you
are
and
i
ll
have
a
man
here
to
put
that
plaster
on
in
the
morning
holiday
or
no
holiday
promised
peter
in
ten
minutes
the
plaster
had
been
swept
up
jane
s
hair
had
received
a
thorough
brushing
bell
had
been
relieved
of
several
lumps
which
had
worked
their
way
down
his
back
and
the
family
went
to
bed
in
as
good
spirits
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
next
morning
peter
started
early
in
quest
of
a
plasterer
to
restore
the
ceiling
and
finding
it
by
no
means
easy
to
discover
one
who
cared
to
work
when
he
might
play
came
home
after
two
hours
search
baffled
but
still
determined
a
passing
acquaintance
gave
him
a
clue
and
he
was
presently
hurrying
across
the
street
in
search
of
the
townsends
coachman
whose
brother
the
acquaintance
had
said
might
be
persuaded
to
do
the
job
in
the
stables
much
to
his
astonishment
he
came
fairly
upon
the
girl
whose
propensity
for
losing
things
he
had
described
with
so
much
gusto
the
evening
before
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
quickly
he
seemed
to
be
always
begging
her
pardon
but
i
was
looking
for
your
coachman
i
he
i
hoped
he
could
tell
me
the
name
that
is
of
course
he
knows
the
name
i
mean
i
wanted
his
brother
s
address
peter
was
no
stammerer
and
it
irritated
him
very
much
to
be
saying
all
this
so
awkwardly
but
there
was
something
about
the
cool
dark
eyes
of
this
girl
as
she
stood
looking
at
him
which
rather
disconcerted
him
she
had
evidently
just
dismounted
from
her
horse
and
now
peter
observed
two
things
first
that
she
was
rather
oddly
pale
and
second
that
her
had
slipped
and
rested
at
an
altogether
improper
angle
upon
the
horse
s
back
as
he
saw
this
he
came
forward
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
quickly
you
haven
t
had
a
fall
you
didn
t
ride
this
way
of
course
yes
i
did
she
answered
lifting
her
head
rather
high
and
then
suddenly
drooping
it
again
how
far
when
did
it
slip
were
you
alone
peter
examined
the
it
began
to
slip
back
at
the
boulevard
said
the
girl
rather
slowly
i
i
don
t
know
just
how
i
kept
on
but
i
did
lewis
is
n
t
here
he
ought
to
be
i
can
t
put
up
blackthorn
myself
let
me
do
it
for
you
peter
took
the
bridle
from
her
he
soon
had
the
horse
in
the
stall
and
had
put
away
the
saddle
and
bridle
that
was
a
plucky
thing
to
do
declared
peter
coming
back
to
the
stable
door
where
the
girl
had
dropped
into
the
coachman
s
chair
to
ride
home
with
a
slipping
saddle
but
you
ought
not
to
have
done
it
you
know
it
might
have
slipped
a
lot
more
with
a
jerk
and
thrown
you
see
here
you
re
not
feeling
just
right
are
you
shall
i
call
somebody
no
no
she
started
up
if
mother
knew
the
least
thing
went
wrong
she
would
n
t
let
me
ride
at
all
if
you
if
you
just
would
n
t
mind
staying
here
a
little
till
i
feel
like
myself
again
why
of
course
i
will
and
peter
stayed
it
was
only
for
a
few
minutes
and
meanwhile
lewis
the
coachman
had
returned
and
the
matter
of
the
loose
had
been
fully
discussed
by
all
three
then
peter
took
his
way
home
jane
met
him
at
the
door
did
you
find
where
the
plasterer
lives
she
asked
eagerly
peter
stared
at
her
turned
about
and
gazed
across
the
street
as
if
he
expected
to
see
a
plasterer
following
in
his
path
trowel
and
float
in
hand
then
he
burst
into
a
laugh
he
mumbled
something
which
sounded
like
a
very
peculiar
name
if
it
was
a
name
and
rapidly
retraced
his
footsteps
across
the
street
to
make
his
inquiry
of
lewis
the
coachman
chapter
iii
peter
sees
a
light
the
bells
had
been
at
home
for
a
fortnight
in
gay
street
the
little
house
was
in
order
from
cellar
to
roof
and
its
occupants
had
settled
down
to
the
routine
of
their
daily
living
well
content
with
the
new
abode
in
a
way
they
missed
the
larger
house
and
freer
environments
of
the
remote
suburban
place
they
had
left
but
the
early
hour
at
which
bell
and
the
boys
were
now
able
to
reach
home
and
the
later
one
at
which
they
could
leave
in
the
morning
amply
compensated
for
the
more
cramped
quarters
made
necessary
by
the
higher
rates
of
rental
in
the
city
it
s
not
a
very
friendly
neighborhood
though
is
it
janey
commented
peter
one
evening
as
he
and
jane
stood
on
the
porch
enjoying
the
mild
evening
how
many
calls
have
you
had
two
three
corrected
jane
cheerfully
the
two
old
ladies
on
the
right
the
mother
of
six
the
left
and
one
odd
person
from
westlake
street
the
rest
are
still
looking
us
over
nobody
from
worthington
square
peter
s
tone
was
quizzical
absolutely
nobody
jane
laughed
but
we
have
one
acquaintance
in
worthington
square
peter
the
little
townsend
girl
with
the
sweet
pale
face
she
wants
to
know
us
dreadfully
and
she
s
such
a
dear
democratic
little
person
the
smiles
positively
tremble
on
her
mouth
when
i
meet
her
which
i
do
almost
every
day
so
does
nancy
it
s
the
oddest
thing
nan
says
she
almost
never
stirs
out
that
the
townsend
child
does
n
t
appear
she
wants
to
get
acquainted
i
don
t
blame
her
they
re
the
dullest
lot
over
there
there
seems
to
be
one
stirabout
the
chap
who
s
off
on
horseback
every
day
but
the
other
son
s
a
paleface
and
the
daughter
hum
well
peter
s
pause
was
eloquent
i
think
she
s
hello
what
s
that
he
had
looked
over
at
the
big
house
as
he
spoke
of
its
inmates
and
his
eye
had
been
caught
by
an
appearance
which
struck
him
as
unusual
the
house
was
dimly
lighted
everywhere
but
in
one
room
the
upper
one
with
the
semicircular
window
there
was
an
effect
of
brilliancy
of
a
ruddier
color
than
is
ordinarily
produced
by
electric
lights
as
peter
and
jane
now
stared
at
it
it
seemed
to
grow
in
intensity
and
there
showed
a
wavering
and
flashing
of
this
singular
light
which
looked
suspiciously
like
fire
do
you
suppose
there
can
be
anything
wrong
speculated
peter
anxiously
of
course
a
fire
of
coke
or
cannel
in
a
fireplace
might
give
that
effect
through
those
thin
curtains
but
we
haven
t
seen
anything
like
it
before
and
by
george
as
the
light
flared
more
ruddily
than
ever
for
an
instant
and
then
grew
dull
again
i
believe
there
trouble
there
anyhow
i
ll
run
over
and
find
out
they
can
t
blame
me
for
that
he
was
starting
off
at
a
run
when
jane
darted
after
him
i
m
sure
i
saw
flames
jump
up
pete
she
called
excitedly
the
window
s
open
and
the
curtain
blew
to
one
side
oh
hurry
most
of
them
are
away
i
saw
them
drive
off
an
hour
ago
she
was
running
at
peter
s
side
fleet
of
foot
as
he
her
mind
had
leaped
to
the
youngest
member
of
the
unknown
household
the
one
who
did
not
drive
away
after
nightfall
to
dinners
and
parties
like
the
others
only
that
day
she
had
met
shirley
and
exchanged
with
her
the
few
bright
words
the
little
girl
seemed
to
welcome
so
eagerly
they
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
great
portico
with
its
stately
columns
and
hurrying
across
it
came
to
a
partly
opened
door
peter
rang
the
bell
peering
impatiently
through
the
vestibule
into
the
large
square
interior
i
ll
wait
just
one
minute
for
an
answer
he
said
with
his
foot
on
the
threshold
and
then
i
ll
be
up
that
gorgeous
staircase
back
there
jane
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
i
smell
smoke
she
breathed
and
peter
pushed
past
her
delaying
no
longer
he
ran
across
the
hall
and
up
the
staircase
closely
followed
by
jane
as
he
reached
the
top
a
little
figure
ran
screaming
toward
him
he
rushed
by
but
jane
at
his
heels
caught
the
little
girl
up
in
her
arms
there
there
darling
she
soothed
the
frightened
sobbing
child
you
re
all
safe
peter
will
take
care
of
the
fire
are
they
all
away
there
don
t
be
frightened
dear
over
shirley
s
head
jane
saw
peter
vanish
through
a
doorway
beyond
which
she
could
see
a
mass
of
smoke
and
flame
slam
down
a
window
and
dash
out
again
closing
the
door
behind
him
then
he
was
off
down
the
stairs
shouting
for
help
as
he
went
and
getting
no
response
from
any
quarter
of
the
strangely
deserted
house
take
her
away
he
called
back
to
jane
as
he
ran
and
jane
attempted
to
obey
where
are
your
clothes
dear
she
asked
the
child
in
her
arms
but
could
get
no
coherent
answer
she
looked
about
her
and
carrying
shirley
who
was
slender
and
as
light
of
weight
as
a
much
younger
child
soon
discovered
the
little
girl
s
room
she
caught
up
the
pile
of
clothes
on
a
chair
and
attempted
to
dress
her
charge
but
shirley
only
cried
and
clung
jane
pulled
a
silken
blanket
from
the
little
brass
bed
and
wrapping
the
child
in
it
and
rolling
her
clothes
into
a
bundle
which
she
tucked
under
one
arm
carried
her
downstairs
and
into
a
small
near
the
front
entrance
peter
dashing
through
the
silent
house
toward
the
rear
hoping
to
come
upon
a
somewhere
was
met
at
last
by
a
startled
maid
a
room
upstairs
is
on
fire
he
said
any
men
here
to
help
me
put
it
out
if
there
are
n
t
i
must
send
in
an
alarm
any
about
the
girl
s
wits
scattered
at
the
news
but
she
managed
to
recall
the
fact
that
the
coachman
must
be
at
the
stable
again
by
this
time
and
flew
to
call
him
peter
ran
back
to
keep
track
of
events
he
saw
that
the
walls
were
heavy
that
the
fire
was
thus
far
confined
to
the
one
room
and
that
if
help
came
speedily
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
call
out
the
fire
department
an
expedient
to
be
avoided
he
felt
sure
unless
the
danger
to
the
house
was
greater
than
he
thought
but
the
frightened
maid
forestalled
him
in
this
plan
she
ran
to
the
telephone
and
sent
in
the
alarm
herself
although
in
the
confusion
of
her
fright
she
lost
some
minutes
in
getting
the
message
properly
reported
meanwhile
the
coachman
having
arrived
to
aid
peter
bringing
with
him
the
apparatus
kept
in
the
stables
for
the
purpose
of
extinguishing
fire
the
two
were
soon
successfully
fighting
the
flames
without
further
aid
shirley
downstairs
was
still
trembling
in
jane
s
arms
and
incoherently
crying
for
her
brother
murray
who
she
insisted
had
not
gone
out
with
the
others
that
evening
but
had
been
reading
in
the
room
which
was
now
on
fire
at
that
moment
murray
himself
came
limping
in
at
the
open
door
the
maid
met
him
at
the
threshold
o
murray
she
began
and
jane
in
the
heard
her
the
house
is
on
fire
and
what
where
where
s
shirley
who
s
jane
with
the
child
in
her
arms
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
she
s
here
quite
safe
she
said
and
with
an
exclamation
murray
came
anxiously
toward
the
two
then
he
paused
and
looked
up
the
staircase
for
through
the
distant
closed
door
upstairs
could
be
heard
the
sounds
of
voices
shouting
directions
the
maid
was
beginning
an
excited
explanation
when
jane
interrupted
her
my
brother
is
here
and
he
and
your
coachman
are
putting
it
out
i
m
sure
has
anybody
sent
in
an
alarm
i
did
said
the
maid
the
young
man
told
me
not
to
but
how
did
he
know
he
could
put
it
out
and
the
master
d
be
blamin
me
we
don
t
want
the
firemen
here
if
we
don
t
need
them
murray
was
beginning
when
the
distant
and
familiar
clang
of
a
gong
stopped
the
words
upon
his
lips
in
a
moment
more
it
became
evident
that
a
and
its
train
were
upon
them
murray
turned
away
and
started
hurriedly
up
the
stairs
at
the
approaching
noises
which
to
the
delicate
child
had
always
been
peculiarly
terrifying
little
shirley
began
to
cry
afresh
jane
gathered
her
up
with
an
air
of
determination
i
m
going
to
take
her
to
our
house
across
the
street
she
said
to
the
maid
there
s
no
need
of
her
staying
here
to
be
so
frightened
the
girl
made
no
remonstrance
she
was
too
excited
to
do
more
than
bewail
the
absence
of
the
other
servants
and
the
misfortune
of
her
having
been
left
alone
in
charge
i
d
just
stepped
out
of
the
door
a
minute
miss
she
explained
to
speak
to
a
friend
of
mine
that
was
passing
t
was
a
mercy
i
left
the
door
open
or
the
young
gentleman
couldn
t
have
there
s
the
gong
there
s
the
oh
my
but
look
at
the
crowd
comin
after
em
show
me
a
side
door
where
i
can
slip
out
please
requested
jane
hurriedly
and
the
maid
obeyed
as
the
firemen
ran
in
at
the
front
door
jane
with
shirley
in
her
arms
hurried
out
at
a
low
side
entrance
from
which
a
path
through
the
shrubbery
led
to
a
gateway
in
the
high
hedge
next
the
street
as
she
reached
her
own
porch
the
rest
of
her
family
came
rushing
out
having
heard
the
commotion
in
the
street
she
almost
ran
into
nancy
who
stopped
abruptly
to
stare
at
jane
s
burden
come
back
into
the
house
with
me
nan
said
jane
quickly
here
s
our
frightened
little
neighbour
the
fire
will
soon
be
out
but
i
thought
she
d
be
happier
over
here
for
the
family
are
all
away
in
the
house
she
put
shirley
down
upon
the
couch
in
the
front
room
and
the
child
staring
up
her
big
eyes
full
of
tears
and
fright
beheld
the
face
of
the
girl
she
had
so
longed
to
know
smiling
down
at
her
this
is
splendid
said
nancy
bell
i
ve
wanted
to
know
you
like
everything
and
now
i
ve
got
you
right
here
in
my
own
house
won
t
you
let
me
help
you
get
dressed
i
d
love
to
seeing
that
nancy
would
be
better
for
the
shy
little
visitor
than
any
number
of
older
persons
jane
left
the
two
together
and
went
out
to
see
what
was
happening
it
was
very
little
the
was
already
turning
to
leave
the
driver
grumbling
at
a
needless
alarm
all
out
a
voice
was
shouting
and
the
crowd
was
reluctantly
pausing
upon
the
edge
of
the
lawn
disappointed
that
no
further
excitement
was
to
be
had
upstairs
the
firemen
had
found
the
fire
subdued
to
a
mere
dying
smother
of
smoke
the
efficient
chemical
having
made
quick
work
of
the
blaze
which
had
not
had
time
to
attack
the
walls
of
the
room
but
had
been
confined
to
its
furnishings
peter
his
hands
and
clothes
grimy
made
light
of
the
affair
to
murray
who
was
looking
in
at
the
ruin
of
the
room
i
took
a
few
liberties
with
your
front
door
peter
said
finding
it
open
and
no
one
about
oh
no
it
hadn
t
much
headway
i
saw
that
when
i
decided
not
to
call
out
the
department
it
was
quite
a
blaze
but
mostly
the
light
stuff
about
it
must
have
caught
from
the
curtains
blowing
into
that
that
s
my
fault
murray
owned
i
hate
electric
lights
to
read
by
so
i
lighted
that
lamp
here
i
was
reading
but
the
room
began
to
feel
stuffy
and
i
opened
the
window
it
looked
so
pleasant
outside
i
thought
i
d
take
a
turn
round
the
square
i
m
not
a
fast
walker
he
glanced
at
his
lame
leg
and
i
was
probably
at
the
other
side
of
the
square
when
you
came
in
look
here
you
must
have
been
mighty
quick
to
take
in
the
situation
for
i
couldn
t
have
been
away
over
five
minutes
when
you
saw
the
blaze
my
sister
and
i
happened
to
be
standing
out
on
our
porch
you
see
we
live
just
round
the
corner
in
gay
street
about
opposite
these
windows
here
i
know
murray
nodded
i
ve
seen
you
we
thought
at
first
it
was
a
fire
you
know
how
they
flash
with
a
red
light
but
when
we
suspected
we
just
ran
across
i
hope
your
little
sister
wasn
t
too
badly
frightened
her
room
s
next
to
this
poor
child
she
frightened
i
deserve
a
thrashing
you
know
for
my
carelessness
every
one
of
the
family
is
out
and
all
the
servants
except
my
mother
s
maid
it
was
very
kind
of
your
sister
to
take
shirley
in
charge
she
s
downstairs
with
her
now
will
your
people
be
getting
news
of
the
and
be
frightened
peter
asked
putting
on
his
coat
i
don
t
think
so
father
and
mother
are
out
of
town
at
a
dinner
and
my
sister
s
at
a
party
in
a
country
house
they
won
t
be
likely
to
hear
i
don
t
know
where
my
brother
is
don
t
go
must
you
i
you
know
i
m
awfully
obliged
to
you
for
this
it
s
nothing
glad
i
happened
to
be
on
hand
and
peter
would
have
said
good
night
and
run
down
the
stairs
but
he
saw
that
his
host
meant
to
go
down
with
him
so
he
descended
slowly
keeping
pace
with
the
other
s
halting
steps
and
talking
with
him
as
he
went
your
sister
was
here
when
i
came
in
said
murray
glancing
into
the
small
the
maid
who
had
been
watching
the
departure
of
the
crowd
from
the
window
of
this
room
turned
to
him
the
young
lady
took
miss
shirley
home
with
her
she
explained
i
was
that
flustered
i
let
her
go
without
so
much
as
asking
you
murray
but
it
s
all
right
murray
put
in
hastily
it
was
just
the
thing
to
do
the
child
was
so
scared
if
they
re
at
your
house
i
ll
just
step
over
there
with
you
if
you
don
t
mind
glad
to
have
you
said
peter
wondering
what
jane
would
say
to
this
second
unexpected
introduction
murray
as
he
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
in
gay
street
felt
distinctly
glad
of
the
chance
since
his
illness
he
had
led
a
lonely
life
and
he
longed
for
comrades
near
at
hand
from
behind
the
curtains
he
had
done
not
a
little
watching
of
the
coming
and
going
in
gay
street
and
had
been
strongly
attracted
toward
each
one
of
the
household
across
the
way
he
liked
the
faces
of
those
people
he
had
wished
that
he
could
make
their
acquaintance
walk
in
invited
peter
throwing
the
door
hospitably
open
and
murray
his
quick
curious
eyes
taking
in
everything
at
a
glance
entered
the
small
front
room
which
was
just
then
unoccupied
he
heard
voices
and
laughter
near
at
hand
but
for
the
moment
while
peter
went
to
summon
his
mother
he
had
time
to
look
about
him
there
was
not
very
much
in
the
room
and
there
was
nothing
of
value
as
that
word
was
used
in
the
townsend
house
yet
the
visitor
could
not
help
finding
the
place
warmly
attractive
there
was
a
homelike
look
about
it
and
there
was
an
indefinable
air
of
refinement
the
furniture
was
old
and
very
nearly
shabby
but
it
was
not
the
cheap
and
tawdry
furniture
one
might
have
expected
to
find
in
such
a
house
the
pictures
on
the
walls
were
all
good
copies
of
great
pictures
or
photographs
set
under
glass
piles
of
music
lay
on
the
square
piano
and
a
few
papers
and
magazines
all
of
good
selection
were
upon
the
table
in
the
centre
of
which
burned
a
brilliant
lamp
but
most
of
all
the
character
of
the
household
was
shown
by
the
books
as
it
inevitably
is
of
these
there
were
a
surprising
number
murray
felt
his
respect
for
the
bell
family
rising
immensely
as
he
noted
the
contents
of
the
rows
of
they
were
in
plain
worn
bindings
most
of
them
quite
unlike
the
stately
rows
in
the
great
library
at
home
but
they
were
the
same
old
friends
in
common
clothes
and
murray
rejoiced
at
the
sight
peter
was
quickly
back
bringing
with
him
the
lady
whom
murray
recognised
as
the
mother
of
the
family
she
a
lady
no
doubt
of
that
he
had
been
sure
of
it
before
now
as
he
listened
to
her
voice
the
test
incontrovertible
he
knew
beyond
question
she
greeted
him
cordially
he
was
charmed
with
her
face
with
her
manner
with
everything
about
her
then
peter
brought
all
the
others
in
and
murray
shook
hands
with
them
all
shirley
appeared
clinging
to
nancy
s
hands
and
shirley
was
so
happy
and
begged
so
hard
in
his
ear
to
stay
a
few
minutes
longer
that
he
willingly
delayed
their
departure
fine
fellows
peter
and
ross
and
rufus
proved
to
be
on
acquaintance
not
in
the
least
overawed
by
the
presence
of
the
rich
man
s
son
from
worthington
square
they
talked
business
and
football
and
politics
and
various
other
things
in
those
few
minutes
in
a
hearty
decidedly
manly
fashion
that
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
happened
that
murray
said
less
to
jane
than
to
any
of
the
others
but
he
noticed
her
not
a
little
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
girl
who
looked
so
spirited
and
sweet
and
gay
and
gentle
all
in
one
he
felt
that
his
sister
olive
must
learn
to
know
her
at
once
that
she
might
learn
what
it
is
to
be
pretty
without
seeming
aware
of
the
fact
and
how
it
is
possible
to
make
a
stranger
feel
wholly
at
his
ease
without
appearing
to
exercise
any
arts
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
taking
my
sister
home
murray
said
at
last
getting
to
his
feet
the
truth
is
she
has
wanted
to
know
miss
nancy
since
she
first
saw
her
and
so
murray
wanted
to
know
you
too
said
shirley
in
nancy
s
ear
but
as
her
brother
paused
the
words
were
audible
to
everybody
to
know
queried
nancy
in
surprise
and
everybody
smiled
i
m
sure
my
mother
and
sister
will
call
soon
said
murray
trying
to
feel
sure
of
that
rather
doubtful
proposition
as
he
made
it
the
moment
would
have
been
an
awkward
one
in
some
small
houses
for
it
was
impossible
not
to
remember
that
the
worthington
squares
do
not
make
many
calls
in
the
gay
streets
but
young
rufus
studying
shirley
with
interest
broke
in
without
intention
upon
his
mother
s
reply
rufus
was
quite
untroubled
by
the
social
inequalities
existing
between
localities
divided
only
by
a
stone
s
throw
that
s
a
dandy
you
will
have
there
when
you
put
it
out
he
remarked
it
s
pretty
fair
and
we
shall
have
it
in
shape
early
this
year
replied
murray
smiling
there
was
a
beauty
about
murray
s
rare
smile
which
quite
transformed
his
pale
face
his
eyes
met
jane
s
as
he
spoke
it
s
too
bad
to
grow
up
past
the
point
of
breaking
the
ice
so
easily
is
n
t
it
she
said
merrily
as
he
shook
hands
we
ll
have
to
follow
their
wise
example
he
replied
i
hope
that
you
ll
find
your
way
over
to
gay
street
often
in
the
future
declared
peter
shaking
hands
i
mean
to
thank
you
if
you
ll
let
me
murray
looked
into
bell
s
eyes
and
a
shade
of
wistfulness
crept
into
his
own
which
she
saw
and
recognising
was
sure
she
understood
please
come
if
you
care
to
she
said
cordially
and
he
felt
her
warm
firm
hand
give
his
a
friendly
pressure
which
quite
completed
the
capturing
of
his
heart
a
ringing
step
on
the
porch
outside
a
knock
at
the
door
it
boasted
no
bell
and
everybody
looked
up
surprised
for
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
ross
opened
the
door
i
beg
your
pardon
said
a
gay
and
careless
voice
outside
but
i
came
to
look
for
my
brother
and
sister
they
seem
to
be
lost
and
i
m
told
they
re
here
come
in
said
ross
and
the
owner
of
the
voice
appeared
upon
the
threshold
standing
there
surveying
the
company
with
his
characteristically
assured
expression
his
handsome
face
taking
on
a
saucy
smile
as
his
eyes
fell
on
his
brother
forrest
townsend
was
carefully
and
formally
presented
by
murray
to
each
one
of
the
household
in
turn
he
looked
a
fine
figure
in
his
evening
clothes
his
long
outer
coat
falling
open
his
hat
in
his
hand
his
audacious
young
eyes
fell
on
jane
before
he
was
presented
to
her
and
his
manner
acquired
a
sort
of
laughing
gallantry
rather
effective
it
was
a
very
lucky
fire
for
us
he
said
gaily
as
he
bowed
i
only
wish
i
had
been
at
home
chapter
iv
forrest
plays
a
trick
it
s
no
more
than
civil
mother
that
you
and
olive
should
go
over
and
call
insisted
murray
townsend
with
heat
i
can
t
see
that
it
is
necessary
at
all
replied
townsend
with
offsetting
coolness
the
young
man
has
been
properly
thanked
for
his
services
indeed
i
should
say
that
between
you
and
forrest
and
shirley
the
entire
family
have
had
quite
fuss
enough
made
over
them
i
didn
t
make
much
of
the
fuss
forrest
said
i
was
only
there
five
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
show
time
enough
to
see
though
that
those
people
are
n
t
off
the
same
piece
as
the
usual
tenants
of
that
house
they
ve
seen
better
days
or
i
miss
my
guess
not
at
all
they
ve
never
had
much
money
but
they
re
educated
people
just
the
same
a
mighty
good
sort
you
ve
only
to
look
at
the
books
that
fairly
line
that
little
room
to
see
for
yourself
is
n
t
there
any
rule
for
sizing
up
men
but
by
the
dollars
they
ve
made
or
women
but
by
the
clothes
they
wear
the
vehemence
of
murray
s
speech
was
so
unusual
and
his
ordinarily
quiet
and
indifferent
expression
had
given
place
to
one
so
eager
that
the
family
all
turned
with
one
accord
to
look
at
him
they
were
at
dinner
one
late
april
evening
a
week
after
the
fire
the
was
the
one
place
in
the
house
where
all
the
family
were
accustomed
to
meet
therefore
any
question
of
the
sort
which
murray
had
proposed
was
brought
up
there
as
a
matter
of
course
townsend
himself
answered
his
son
s
pointed
observation
forestalling
the
rejoinder
about
to
fall
from
his
wife
s
lips
it
s
the
way
of
the
world
murray
and
an
unjust
one
in
many
cases
still
one
can
t
help
feeling
that
a
man
who
has
lived
to
the
age
of
joseph
bell
without
reaching
a
position
higher
than
the
one
he
holds
with
the
armstrong
company
can
t
be
possessed
of
a
very
unusual
endowment
of
brains
i
should
say
that
depends
on
whether
making
money
has
been
his
ambition
or
something
else
he
certainly
hasn
t
achieved
the
something
else
was
olive
s
comment
not
even
a
decent
home
decent
murray
turned
on
her
it
s
a
home
worthy
the
name
i
can
tell
you
that
and
if
you
refuse
to
call
on
these
people
that
live
in
it
after
peter
bell
saved
ours
over
our
heads
i
say
you
re
acting
like
snobs
murray
his
mother
spoke
very
sharply
forrest
laughed
he
enjoyed
the
scene
being
inclined
by
his
remembrance
of
jane
to
take
his
brother
s
side
townsend
came
to
the
rescue
you
are
rather
rough
in
your
language
murray
but
i
think
you
are
right
in
your
notions
about
the
call
it
s
only
a
courtesy
surely
eloise
to
go
over
and
make
one
call
you
don
t
need
to
continue
the
acquaintance
unless
you
wish
but
i
should
be
glad
myself
if
you
would
go
it
is
several
days
now
since
it
s
a
week
said
murray
he
knows
no
doubt
of
that
laughed
forrest
he
s
cultivated
the
acquaintance
anyhow
i
saw
him
walking
up
the
street
yesterday
with
the
pretty
girl
of
the
family
you
walked
up
with
her
yourself
the
day
before
cried
shirley
forrest
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
you
re
a
little
spy
well
i
don
t
mind
owning
that
i
did
she
s
a
girl
on
the
street
too
if
she
does
n
t
wear
the
furbelows
olive
does
she
we
may
as
well
go
over
and
call
mother
said
olive
with
emphasis
if
both
the
boys
are
running
after
the
family
we
ought
to
find
out
what
they
are
you
won
t
be
so
condescending
as
you
think
murray
said
to
her
as
he
left
the
room
at
her
side
bell
is
n
t
the
sort
to
be
impressed
with
the
honour
you
do
her
townsend
and
olive
realising
that
the
wishes
of
the
three
male
members
of
the
family
were
not
to
be
lightly
disregarded
made
the
call
without
further
delay
dressed
as
carefully
as
if
they
had
been
calling
in
worthington
square
they
knocked
upon
the
door
of
the
little
house
in
gay
street
and
were
admitted
by
nancy
it
chanced
that
this
was
a
saturday
afternoon
and
saturday
was
a
for
nearly
all
workers
in
the
city
thus
it
came
about
that
in
the
middle
of
the
stiff
little
call
stiff
in
spite
of
bell
and
jane
who
had
received
their
visitors
with
all
simplicity
and
naturalness
peter
arrived
at
home
being
burdened
with
small
parcels
he
hurried
round
to
the
kitchen
door
and
depositing
his
parcels
on
the
table
there
started
in
search
of
his
sisters
jane
nan
where
are
you
he
shouted
through
the
little
house
and
before
nancy
springing
down
the
stairs
could
stop
him
he
had
bolted
into
the
front
room
olive
townsend
turning
quickly
recognised
the
big
youth
with
the
face
who
had
several
times
been
of
assistance
to
her
peter
was
presented
to
the
visitors
by
his
mother
who
seemed
quite
undisturbed
by
the
interruption
jane
only
laughed
and
peter
himself
recovered
his
balance
with
but
a
momentary
show
of
confusion
it
was
important
business
you
see
he
said
smiling
and
explaining
to
jane
i
brought
home
the
you
wanted
and
i
had
an
idea
they
must
get
into
the
ground
within
the
next
fifteen
minutes
or
it
would
be
too
late
i
don
t
wonder
he
thought
so
jane
said
to
olive
glancing
from
her
brother
to
her
guest
i
impressed
upon
him
this
morning
the
fact
that
if
the
sweet
peas
were
n
t
planted
we
should
n
t
have
any
growing
before
august
don
t
go
peter
perhaps
miss
townsend
can
tell
us
what
else
we
ought
to
have
in
our
garden
peter
obediently
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
olive
responding
that
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
gardens
because
the
gardener
always
attended
to
whatever
there
were
about
the
grounds
was
conscious
of
a
keen
and
steady
scrutiny
from
peter
s
cool
gray
eyes
quite
as
if
he
were
not
in
the
least
abashed
by
her
distinguished
presence
she
was
moreover
forced
to
acknowledge
as
the
moments
went
by
that
peter
could
talk
and
talk
well
he
came
to
the
assistance
of
jane
who
had
begun
to
feel
the
difficulties
of
entertaining
the
visitor
and
told
an
amusing
incident
of
the
morning
s
experience
before
she
knew
it
olive
was
laughing
for
peter
s
clever
mimicry
was
quite
irresistible
as
she
rose
to
go
olive
made
an
immense
condescension
i
believe
it
must
have
been
you
bell
she
said
who
picked
up
my
handkerchief
for
me
one
day
peter
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
with
a
droll
gesture
and
a
formal
bow
an
interesting
i
think
i
had
the
honour
he
admitted
with
a
twinkle
and
now
something
unforeseen
happened
exactly
as
the
visitors
rose
to
go
the
april
skies
which
five
minutes
before
had
been
smiling
suddenly
opened
and
poured
out
one
of
those
astonishing
spring
downfalls
which
arrest
street
traffic
on
the
instant
townsend
and
olive
with
the
door
opening
to
let
them
out
stood
still
upon
the
threshold
in
dismay
glancing
down
at
their
delicate
spring
attire
you
can
t
go
in
this
said
bell
cordially
it
will
be
over
soon
please
come
back
and
sit
down
the
fates
must
surely
have
intended
from
the
first
to
mix
up
things
between
these
two
families
of
townsend
and
bell
with
that
end
in
view
nothing
could
have
been
more
opportune
than
this
shower
for
it
lasted
a
good
without
showing
signs
of
slackening
and
it
contributed
also
lightning
and
thunder
which
made
olive
shrink
and
shudder
also
ross
mcandrew
and
young
rufus
bell
coming
home
in
the
late
afternoon
and
being
caught
at
the
corner
in
the
downpour
dashed
for
the
little
front
porch
for
shelter
and
then
into
the
ross
making
apologies
on
account
of
his
moist
condition
and
getting
through
the
room
and
out
with
rufus
as
fast
as
possible
was
yet
able
to
take
in
the
surprising
fact
that
peter
was
sitting
in
the
corner
with
the
girl
from
the
aristocratic
square
chatting
cheerfully
with
her
and
eliciting
not
altogether
unwilling
smiles
in
response
out
in
the
kitchen
with
the
door
closed
ross
and
rufus
interviewed
nancy
how
on
earth
did
old
peter
get
into
it
like
this
ross
inquired
as
he
hung
his
coat
to
dry
by
the
stove
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
to
see
him
confabulating
with
miss
worthington
square
she
seems
quite
human
does
n
t
she
when
you
get
her
indoors
i
don
t
know
said
nancy
i
only
let
them
in
she
looks
awfully
pretty
don
t
you
think
and
maybe
she
s
nice
when
you
get
to
know
her
if
you
ever
do
qualified
ross
pretty
well
all
i
saw
was
a
gorgeous
hat
and
a
pair
of
big
eyes
i
felt
as
if
somebody
was
looking
at
me
with
a
she
is
n
t
in
it
with
our
janey
if
you
re
talking
about
prettiness
no
of
course
not
cried
loyal
nancy
by
the
time
the
storm
had
ceased
a
good
deal
of
the
stiffness
in
the
little
front
room
had
melted
away
it
may
be
possible
for
some
people
to
be
formal
and
frigid
for
the
space
of
a
call
but
to
keep
it
up
for
full
of
an
hour
longer
while
rain
pours
and
lightning
flashes
and
unconventional
young
persons
dash
in
and
out
and
a
youth
like
peter
tells
jolly
stories
that
becomes
much
more
difficult
townsend
maintained
a
peculiar
dignity
to
the
end
but
olive
well
in
spite
of
her
prejudices
olive
was
young
and
liked
young
associates
and
as
she
looked
and
listened
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
for
her
to
refuse
to
recognise
that
the
people
in
this
little
house
were
not
ordinary
not
commonplace
not
uneducated
as
she
had
fancied
them
but
bright
and
gay
and
interesting
when
she
gave
jane
her
hand
as
she
took
her
leave
the
april
storm
having
at
last
given
place
again
to
brilliant
april
sunshine
she
found
herself
wishing
she
might
know
this
prepossessing
maid
there
was
a
straightforward
sweetness
in
the
glance
of
jane
s
rich
hazel
eyes
a
captivating
charm
in
her
free
smile
which
the
other
girl
had
never
encountered
in
quite
so
beguiling
a
form
olive
townsend
of
all
the
girls
whom
jane
had
ever
met
least
likely
to
succumb
to
the
fascinations
of
another
girl
not
in
her
own
set
fell
nevertheless
considerably
under
jane
s
influence
on
that
very
first
encounter
in
taking
leave
she
said
to
jane
that
which
she
had
not
dreamed
of
saying
commonplace
an
expression
of
friendliness
as
it
was
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
often
since
we
live
so
near
gone
gone
all
gone
queried
ross
putting
in
his
head
cautiously
at
the
door
as
the
visitors
turned
the
corner
all
gone
replied
peter
gone
forever
silks
and
velvets
and
new
spring
hats
ribbons
and
laces
and
sweet
pretty
faces
chanted
ross
reminded
of
the
old
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
not
much
sugar
about
miss
worthington
square
eh
pete
oh
i
don
t
know
mused
peter
gazing
absently
out
of
the
window
toward
the
square
where
olive
s
spring
finery
was
just
fluttering
out
of
sight
she
s
not
so
bad
at
close
range
i
should
n
t
wonder
if
an
earthquake
shock
might
stir
her
up
into
quite
an
interesting
girl
lacking
that
some
lesser
convulsion
of
nature
might
possibly
the
bell
family
certainly
did
their
best
to
shock
her
if
daddy
and
nan
could
have
just
burst
in
from
somewhere
i
think
the
effect
would
have
been
complete
declared
jane
merrily
the
subject
of
these
comments
upon
reaching
home
found
herself
called
upon
for
an
opinion
of
the
bells
forrest
townsend
encountering
his
sister
upon
the
stairs
followed
her
to
her
room
own
up
that
they
re
not
as
odd
as
you
thought
he
demanded
they
re
very
well
of
their
sort
was
olive
s
reply
observing
herself
in
her
mirror
and
congratulating
herself
on
the
fact
that
the
new
spring
hat
was
undoubtedly
becoming
see
here
why
not
send
jane
and
peter
an
invitation
to
your
party
and
peter
you
seem
to
be
pretty
intimate
with
them
already
i
don
t
call
them
that
to
their
faces
but
you
ve
seen
for
yourselves
they
re
all
right
ask
them
over
it
won
t
hurt
you
why
forrest
townsend
people
who
don
t
know
a
soul
in
our
set
what
an
idea
a
mighty
good
idea
nobody
ll
know
they
live
in
gay
street
and
you
won
t
be
ashamed
of
them
either
i
shall
not
do
anything
of
the
sort
olive
took
off
the
hat
and
laid
it
in
its
box
i
don
t
know
what
in
the
world
has
got
into
you
and
murray
you
re
both
perfectly
mad
over
the
bells
if
you
re
so
charmed
with
that
girl
you
can
go
and
call
on
her
i
suppose
she
recalled
with
some
surprise
her
own
liking
for
jane
wondering
now
that
her
brother
showed
his
prepossessions
so
strongly
how
she
could
have
fancied
her
it
seemed
sometimes
to
be
a
matter
of
principle
with
olive
never
to
like
the
people
whom
forrest
or
murray
liked
see
here
said
forrest
frowning
i
think
it
s
pretty
of
you
not
to
invite
one
or
two
persons
i
ask
you
to
whether
you
happen
to
want
them
or
not
this
party
may
be
your
birthday
affair
but
there
s
no
reason
why
somebody
else
should
n
t
have
a
hand
in
the
inviting
let
s
see
your
list
will
you
olive
unwillingly
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
the
names
of
her
prospective
guests
were
written
he
scanned
it
sharply
same
old
crowd
he
observed
his
handsome
brows
knit
into
a
scowl
i
should
think
you
d
want
a
little
fresh
blood
to
liven
things
up
for
you
to
sit
in
a
corner
with
you
mean
will
you
do
it
to
please
me
no
olive
snatched
the
list
out
of
his
hand
and
returned
it
to
a
box
which
she
laid
in
a
drawer
of
her
desk
forrest
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
then
without
a
further
word
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
out
of
the
room
two
hours
later
he
came
quietly
back
olive
had
gone
out
as
he
knew
he
crossed
the
room
to
the
desk
searched
and
found
the
box
into
which
he
had
seen
the
list
put
and
discovered
as
he
had
expected
the
invitations
to
the
birthday
party
folded
and
partially
addressed
he
knew
that
they
were
to
go
out
upon
the
morrow
and
that
olive
doubtless
would
finish
the
task
of
addressing
them
that
evening
he
had
heard
her
bewailing
the
fact
that
this
labour
consumed
so
much
time
but
he
had
not
cared
to
offer
to
assist
her
forrest
looked
the
invitations
over
smiling
to
himself
took
out
two
unaddressed
envelopes
and
put
them
into
his
pocket
closed
the
door
and
strolled
away
in
his
own
room
he
took
them
out
again
and
wrote
upon
them
in
his
best
hand
peter
bell
and
miss
jane
bell
adding
the
street
and
number
and
stamping
and
sealing
them
still
with
the
laugh
in
the
corners
of
his
mischievous
mouth
the
next
day
when
olive
s
invitations
went
into
the
on
the
corner
they
were
shortly
followed
by
two
of
which
the
giver
of
the
party
had
no
knowledge
it
happened
that
the
early
morning
mail
in
gay
street
always
arrived
just
before
the
departure
of
the
family
workers
for
their
place
of
business
so
when
nancy
after
answering
the
postman
s
ring
came
back
to
the
table
with
the
mail
both
peter
and
jane
just
finishing
breakfast
were
on
hand
to
receive
it
whose
handwriting
can
this
be
i
wonder
speculated
jane
intently
studying
the
dashing
address
peter
glanced
over
her
shoulder
same
as
mine
he
observed
ripping
his
envelope
open
looks
like
a
wedding
invitation
but
since
none
of
our
friends
janey
are
so
much
as
thinking
of
getting
married
hello
what
s
this
oh
why
jane
was
stammering
eagerly
o
petey
how
lovely
why
there
i
knew
she
was
n
t
as
cold
and
proud
as
you
thought
her
who
what
demanded
nancy
with
excitement
miss
olive
townsend
explained
jane
flushing
with
pleasure
what
miss
worthington
square
invited
you
two
folks
to
her
party
ross
inquired
getting
up
from
the
table
and
reaching
for
his
hat
pete
you
ll
lose
your
car
if
you
stand
mooning
over
that
thing
how
did
you
know
she
was
to
have
a
party
little
miss
shirley
confided
it
to
me

cried
nancy
proudly
but
she
did
n
t
tell
me
her
sister

ask
you
miss
olive
probably
didn
t
intend
to
hazarded
peter
folding
up
his
note
and
putting
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
until
she
came
to
call
and
saw
our
charms
she
came
she
saw
we
conquered
eh
janey
with
our
sweet
smiles
and
our
stories
how
about
it

we
go
if
began
jane
slowly
the
smile
fading
a
little
on
her
bright
face
if
if
we
ve
anything
to
wear
supplied
ross
and
began
to
whistle
gaily
ye
shall
walk
in
silk
breaking
off
to
glance
at
the
clock
and
start
hastily
for
the
door
with
peter
and
rufus
after
him
jane
turned
to
bell
who
sitting
quietly
in
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
regarding
her
young
daughter
as
if
she
understood
all
the
doubts
which
had
instantly
risen
in
the
girl
s
mind
i
think
we
can
manage
it
dear
she
said
if
the
party
dress
does
n
t
have
to
match
the
invitation
jane
s
face
grew
flushed
again
i
can
wear

some
fresh
ribbons
but
peter
yes
peter
agreed
bell
she
rose
and
came
round
to
jane
peter

a
new
cravat
said
she
and
smiled
into
jane
s
eyes
jane
smiled
back
each
knew
that
the
other
was
thinking
of
peter
s
best
black
suit
in
which
he
went
to
church
on
sundays
each
knew
that
the
townsend
sons
would
wear
evening
clothes

new
cravat

said
jane

the
big
porch

all
shut
in
with

stuff
and
there
s
a
striped
awning
where
the
carriages
stop
just
as
if
it
was
a
great
party
or
a
wedding
and
i
saw

carrying
in
loads
of
palms
and
things

t

excited
to
be
going
this
was
nancy
bell
flying
into
the
front
room
upstairs
where
bell
and
jane
were
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
jane
s
frock
to
be
worn

evening

jane
smiling
at
the
eager
little
sister

how
pretty
that
is
nancy
clasped
her
hands
in
ecstasy
over
the
dainty
ruffled
skirt
with
its
tiny
yellow
flowers
scattered
over
a
white
ground
then
she
caught
up
the
long
sash
belt
of
ribbon
its
graceful
rosettes
and
flowing
ends
promising
an
effective
finish
to
the
simple
toilet
you
ll
be
the
prettiest
girl
at
the
party
she
declared
joyously
bell
and
jane
laughed
across
at
each
other
in
a
dimity
their
eyes
said
with
congratulations
reduced
from
eighteen
my
ribbon
is
what
rejoices
my
soul
said
jane
touching
the
soft
silk
that
was
a
bargain
we
just
happened
on
the
price
cut
in
two
because
of
a
few
soiled
places
we
simply
did
n
t
use
those
at
all
and
there
were
enough
long
lengths
to
make
the
streamers
it
s
such
a
beautiful
quality
it
makes
the
whole
dress
look
finer
than
it
is
how
can
you
ever
wait
till
evening
sighed
nancy
o
jane
shirley
wants
me
to
hide
in
the
shrubbery
over
there
by
the
hedge
and
she
s
going
to
slip
out
with
some
and
cake
for
me
bell
s
eyes
and
jane
s
met
again
with
a
smile
jane
s
eyebrows
went
up
in
interrogation
bell
nodded
i
think
nancy
may
have
that
much
of
the
party
she
said
evening
came
at
last
although
nancy
had
moments
of
feeling
sure
that
it
never
would
jane
her
curly
auburn
locks
tied
up
in
charming
fashion
with
various
rebellious
tendrils
waving
about
her
face
slipped
into
the
pretty
frock
and
bell
arranged
the
primrose
girdle
which
set
off
the
whole
effect
peter
in
his
best
black
suit
and
wearing
the
new
cravat
looked
at
his
sister
approvingly
my
but
i
m
proud
of
my
girl
he
said
not
prouder
than
i
am
of
my
big
brother
responded
jane
the
family
saw
them
off
rejoicing
in
their
youthful
good
looks
and
sure
they
would
hold
their
own
in
appearance
with
anybody
in
worthington
square
peter
and
jane
not
feeling
quite
so
confident
yet
experiencing
a
pleasant
stir
of
anticipation
walked
slowly
round
the
corner
nearly
all
the
guests
were
arriving
in
carriages
and
the
brother
and
sister
as
they
crossed
the
porch
encountered
a
number
of
these
entering
from
the
as
jane
s
eyes
fell
upon
the
gaily
dressed
young
people
the
first
thing
she
observed
about
them
gave
her
an
unpleasant
shock
they
all
youths
and
girls
were
wearing
gloves
jane
glanced
from
her
own
round
white
arms
bare
from
the
elbows
to
peter
s
uncovered
hands
peter
we
never
once
thought
of
gloves
she
murmured
in
his
ear
as
they
lingered
to
let
the
party
from
the
carriages
go
in
at
the
door
ahead
of
them
peter
stared
from
her
to
the
other
guests
then
his
gay
twinkle
replaced
the
look
of
dismay
gloves
on
youngsters
like
us
don
t
you
care
a
bit
he
whispered
back
in
her
ear
it
was
a
little
difficult
not
to
care
especially
for
jane
as
in
the
upstairs
she
met
many
curious
glances
the
maid
in
charge
even
offered
to
help
her
put
on
her
gloves
and
jane
could
not
help
feeling
a
bit
unhappy
as
she
replied
that
she
was
not
wearing
gloves
but
the
sight
of
peter
smiling
serenely
at
her
from
the
head
of
the
staircase
where
he
awaited
her
strengthened
her
resolution
not
to
mind
a
glance
at
the
mirror
had
assured
her
that
the
inexpensive
little
dimity
with
its
primrose
ribbons
was
irreproachable
in
its
dainty
distinction
of
style
thanks
to
bell
s
clever
fingers
and
this
knowledge
was
very
comforting
her
face
was
as
bright
as
ever
when
she
joined
peter
whose
hearty
whisper
you
re
all
right
put
her
quite
on
her
feet
again
downstairs
where
olive
townsend
stood
receiving
with
her
mother
with
forrest
and
murray
close
at
hand
a
brief
but
interesting
colloquy
took
place
just
before
jane
and
peter
came
into
the
reception
room
forrest
had
been
keeping
sharp
watch
on
the
hall
entrance
and
the
moment
that
he
saw
the
two
bells
arrive
and
make
their
way
toward
the
staircase
he
watched
for
a
chance
to
get
a
word
in
the
ears
of
his
family
a
lull
in
the
arrivals
gave
him
his
opportunity
olive
he
said
coolly
to
his
sister
in
an
undertone
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
jane
and
peter
bell
an
invitation
and
they
re
here
i
want
you
to
brace
up
and
give
them
just
as
nice
a
welcome
as
you
re
giving
the
rest
hold
on
if
you
re
angry
at
anybody
it
s
at
me
and
you
ve
no
right
to
take
it
out
of
them
for
that
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
if
you
are
frosty
to
them
you
ll
settle
with
me
afterward
he
had
his
sister
in
a
corner
so
to
speak
olive
cared
very
much
for
appearances
there
were
many
eyes
upon
her
she
could
make
no
angry
response
or
show
chagrin
in
any
way
without
attracting
notice
and
comment
all
she
could
do
which
she
promptly
did
was
to
whisper
back
with
lips
which
smiled
for
the
sake
of
those
who
looked
at
her
you
wretch
i
ll
pay
you
off
never
fear
do
i
don
t
mind
and
forrest
approached
his
mother
he
was
her
favourite
son
and
she
was
a
thorough
woman
of
the
world
he
had
reckoned
on
her
making
the
best
of
the
situation
and
when
he
had
told
her
with
a
gay
glance
and
a
furtive
squeeze
of
her
hand
he
received
no
more
severe
threat
of
punishment
than
he
had
expected
in
her
light
you
naughty
boy
you
ll
have
to
take
care
of
them
nobody
else
knows
them
or
will
care
to
i
ll
see
to
them
was
her
son
s
careless
reply
and
he
crossed
over
to
murray
who
was
indifferently
playing
his
part
of
young
host
to
him
as
jane
and
peter
appeared
at
the
doorway
forrest
made
a
hasty
explanation
murray
s
face
instantly
brightened
and
he
answered
promptly
it
was
a
risky
thing
to
do
but
i
m
glad
they
re
here
between
us
we
ll
make
sure
they
have
a
good
time
there
was
nothing
in
the
greeting
of
townsend
or
of
olive
to
give
peter
and
jane
a
hint
of
their
position
the
bells
had
expected
only
a
formal
reception
on
an
occasion
like
this
and
when
they
received
it
felt
no
special
lack
and
whatever
was
wanting
in
the
greeting
of
the
hostesses
was
made
up
by
the
masculine
half
of
the
receiving
party
this
is
jolly
said
forrest
giving
each
a
hearty
grasp
of
the
hand
i
m
immensely
glad
you
could
come
and
as
others
pressed
toward
him
he
passed
them
on
to
murray
do
you
know
said
murray
having
you
two
come
makes
up
to
me
for
the
whole
thing
i
detest
parties
as
a
rule
never
go
to
them
and
would
n
t
come
downstairs
at
our
own
affairs
if
i
could
get
out
of
it
but
i
m
glad
i
could
n
t
this
time
see
here
you
don
t
know
many
of
these
people
do
you
nobody
at
all
of
course
not
having
only
just
moved
into
the
neighbourhood
i
can
t
do
much
myself
except
sit
about
and
look
on
and
i
m
going
to
be
so
bold
as
to
beg
your
company
miss
bell
for
so
much
of
the
evening
as
you
ll
give
me
there
are
a
lot
of
pleasant
nooks
about
the
rooms
and
halls
and
i
d
like
to
try
them
all
with
you
that
s
a
selfish
plan
is
n
t
it
and
he
smiled
at
her
it
s
lovely
of
you
of
course
and
you
know
it
she
answered
it
s
a
risk
for
me
lest
i
lose
you
but
i
ll
present
a
few
of
these
chaps
to
you
first
so
if
you
care
to
dance
i
don
t
truly
i
m
glad
but
i
ll
do
it
for
the
sake
of
my
conscience
and
murray
began
the
task
on
the
spot
half
a
dozen
youths
accordingly
bowed
ceremoniously
to
jane
gazed
with
interest
at
her
charming
face
said
something
or
other
in
the
way
of
an
attempt
at
conversation
and
got
away
again
not
one
asked
jane
to
dance
she
needs
olive
s
guardianship
not
mine
thought
murray
resentfully
if
olive
backed
her
up
the
rest
would
accept
her
in
a
jiffy
but
olive
won
t
do
it
i
know
that
well
enough
so
i
ll
do
my
best
in
my
way
and
thank
my
stars
for
the
chance
there
is
n
t
a
girl
in
the
house
to
match
her
that
s
sure
the
moment
that
his
duties
in
the
were
over
murray
convoyed
jane
away
to
one
of
the
attractive
retreats
he
had
mentioned
a
beflowered
nook
on
the
staircase
landing
from
which
they
could
view
the
hall
below
and
see
the
greater
part
of
the
long
where
the
dancing
had
begun
strains
of
gay
music
from
the
orchestra
floated
pleasantly
up
to
them
now
this
is
something
like
said
murray
sinking
back
upon
the
soft
divan
behind
the
palms
he
pulled
off
his
gloves
as
he
spoke
rolled
them
into
a
ball
and
crammed
them
into
his
pocket
he
did
not
put
them
on
again
that
evening
a
bit
of
kindliness
which
two
guests
understood
and
appreciated
if
i
m
not
monopolising
the
host
when
he
ought
to
be
looking
after
his
other
guests
replied
jane
as
her
eyes
followed
the
distant
dancers
if
there
is
any
monopoly
i
m
the
guilty
one
and
enjoying
my
guilt
honestly
miss
bell
it
s
a
fine
chance
for
me
to
get
acquainted
with
my
neighbour
if
she
ll
let
me
and
as
for
my
being
missed
a
shake
of
the
head
told
jane
more
than
its
owner
meant
of
his
loneliness
at
which
she
had
hitherto
only
guessed
meanwhile
peter
had
also
fallen
into
friendly
hands
if
youthful
ones
shirley
allowed
to
play
a
modest
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
evening
but
finding
nobody
willing
to
give
her
more
than
a
smile
and
nod
fell
upon
peter
as
a
possible
ally
he
had
been
standing
at
one
side
of
the
crush
in
the
doorway
of
the
looking
on
with
interested
eyes
but
feeling
a
trifle
deserted
nevertheless
when
he
felt
a
warm
little
hand
slide
into
his
own
looking
down
surprised
he
met
shirley
s
friendly
smile
you
don
t
know
many
people
do
you
asked
that
frank
young
person
i
don
t
know
anybody
returned
peter
no
i
ought
not
to
say
that
for
your
brother
forrest
presented
me
to
a
number
of
girls
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
dance
and
they
soon
left
me
for
livelier
company
nobody
asks
me
to
dance
either
said
shirley
because
olive
would
n
t
invite
any
boys
of
my
age
and
the
big
ones
want
the
big
girls
i
don
t
peter
assured
her
i
want
one
about
thirteen
years
old
dressed
in
a
jolly
white
lacy
frock
with
pink
ribbons
and
pink
slippers
i
feel
more
at
home
with
a
girl
like
that
than
with
any
of
those
i
was
introduced
to
you
see
their
hair
was
so
done
up
done
up
was
n
t
your
sister
s
hair
done
up
queried
shirley
oh
no
i
remember
those
lovely
thick
curls
of
hers
were
tied
in
a
bunch
at
her
neck
such
a
lovely
way
none
of
the
others
do
theirs
like
that
she
s
awfully
pretty
is
n
t
she
prettier
than
olive
i
think
i
admire
my
sister
very
much
agreed
peter
but
it
would
be
hard
for
anybody
to
be
prettier
than
your
sister
his
eyes
turned
to
olive
as
he
spoke
she
stood
near
by
exchanging
gay
talk
with
a
tall
youth
in
the
interval
between
dances
more
beautifully
dressed
than
any
young
girl
he
had
ever
seen
her
dark
face
lighted
into
brilliancy
by
excitement
the
rare
colour
in
her
cheeks
set
off
by
the
big
bunch
of
red
roses
she
carried
she
was
a
picturesque
figure
indeed
yes
olive
does
look
pretty
admitted
olive
s
little
sister
excuse
me
a
minute
please
she
added
and
slipped
over
to
olive
s
side
if
peter
could
have
heard
the
brief
whispered
conversation
exchanged
he
would
hardly
have
dared
to
stand
watching
it
as
he
did
olive
begged
shirley
when
with
difficulty
she
had
secured
her
sister
s
reluctant
attention
if
i
take
care
of
peter
bell
for
a
while
won
t
you
be
nice
to
him
he
does
n
t
dance
and
he
does
n
t
know
anybody
it
s
enough
that
he
s
here
retorted
olive
with
a
frown
i
didn
t
ask
him
or
his
sister
so
i
you
did
n
t
ask
him
no
no
run
along
but
who
forrest
without
saying
a
word
to
me
oh
shirley
gasped
and
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
she
pulled
at
olive
s
arm
again
olive
but
they
re
our
guests
just
the
same
and
shirley
don
t
bother
me
now
listen
olive
just
a
minute
peter
says
nobody
could
be
prettier
than
you
it
was
a
shot
which
told
olive
s
grudging
attention
was
arrested
she
glanced
over
her
sister
s
head
in
the
direction
of
peter
her
eyes
met
his
and
she
turned
away
again
but
not
before
the
momentary
vision
of
the
strong
intent
face
had
impressed
itself
upon
her
as
rather
better
worth
consideration
than
many
of
the
others
the
thought
of
such
a
compliment
as
shirley
had
reported
coming
from
those
lips
of
peter
bell
gave
the
recipient
rather
a
novel
sensation
olive
had
been
out
of
patience
with
peter
from
the
moment
that
she
caught
sight
of
his
unconventional
attire
but
she
felt
all
at
once
more
tolerant
of
his
presence
he
did
n
t
tell
you
to
tell
me
that
i
suppose
she
whispered
to
shirley
oh
no
i
only
go
back
and
tell
him
to
save
some
time
for
me
after
this
dance
i
ll
keep
the
next
one
for
him
but
olive
you
know
he
does
n
t
dance
i
ll
sit
it
out
with
him
since
he
doesn
t
know
enough
to
come
and
ask
me
for
himself
half
an
hour
later
jane
passing
through
the
hall
with
murray
on
the
way
to
the
library
where
he
was
to
show
her
certain
books
of
which
they
had
been
talking
caught
sight
of
her
brother
just
mounting
the
staircase
to
the
retreat
on
the
landing
to
her
surprise
and
relief
for
she
had
anxiously
looked
for
him
from
time
to
time
and
had
seen
him
with
nobody
but
little
shirley
she
noted
that
he
was
now
in
the
company
of
his
girlish
hostess
and
that
that
young
person
was
turning
upon
him
a
gracious
face
to
jane
the
remainder
of
the
evening
passed
in
full
pleasure
she
spent
an
interesting
hour
in
the
library
with
murray
who
made
himself
a
delightful
companion
expanding
in
the
sympathetic
atmosphere
of
her
good
comradeship
into
a
more
genial
warmth
and
sincerity
of
manner
than
she
had
imagined
him
capable
of
showing
then
forrest
came
in
search
of
her
and
bore
her
away
to
join
a
company
of
young
people
who
were
going
to
supper
together
under
forrest
s
wing
she
found
her
position
secure
for
he
was
a
youth
and
whatsoever
girl
he
chose
to
favour
must
as
he
had
known
be
treated
with
friendliness
by
all
his
companions
jane
s
own
charms
came
to
her
aid
also
and
brought
several
unattached
young
gentlemen
to
her
side
so
that
before
the
evening
was
over
she
had
made
what
forrest
inwardly
congratulated
himself
upon
as
a
respectable
success
upon
the
landing
peter
established
olive
and
himself
on
the
divan
among
the
palms
he
studied
his
companion
s
face
a
moment
then
said
abruptly
i
want
to
tell
you
miss
townsend
that
i
m
more
than
sorry
to
be
here
by
an
accident
she
looked
up
at
him
startled
but
met
only
a
quiet
smile
how
did
you
i
didn
t
mean
you
i
know
you
did
n
t
and
you
were
very
kind
not
to
show
how
you
must
have
felt
perhaps
it
would
be
in
better
taste
for
me
not
to
mention
it
at
all
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
appreciated
your
courtesy
in
accepting
the
situation
but
how
i
found
out
from
a
little
slip
of
miss
shirley
s
i
wanted
to
go
home
of
course
but
i
could
n
t
make
up
my
mind
to
spoil
my
sister
s
evening
and
besides
i
thought
your
brother
s
invitation
made
it
right
for
us
to
be
here
olive
s
dark
face
was
colouring
warmly
she
looked
down
at
her
roses
wondering
what
to
say
somehow
she
found
herself
unwilling
to
let
peter
bell
think
she
did
n
t
want
him
at
her
party
for
it
was
becoming
clear
to
her
that
she
did
i
m
so
sorry
she
murmured
but
i
m
very
glad
you
did
n
t
go
home
if
i
had
known
you
longer
i
m
sure
i
should
have
invited
don
t
bother
to
explain
urged
peter
s
low
voice
i
did
n
t
tell
you
to
make
you
uncomfortable
perhaps
you
won
t
mind
my
saying
that
looking
on
at
this
sort
of
thing
is
very
interesting
to
me
i
ve
never
seen
it
before
how
do
you
like
it
asked
olive
glancing
up
at
him
curiously
peter
laughed
looking
off
for
a
moment
toward
the
i
m
an
outdoor
sort
of
chap
i
think
he
said
yet
it
s
very
pretty
all
that
down
there
and
i
like
to
look
at
it
miss
townsend
do
you
ride
horseback
much
sometimes
not
often
i
don
t
care
for
it
neither
should
i
down
the
boulevard
or
in
the
park
but
out
on
a
country
road
i
m
a
country
boy
and
i
like
a
good
gallop
down
the
old
northboro
road
miles
of
it
as
smooth
as
a
floor
as
for
ah
there
s
sport
i
ve
never
seen
you
ride
peter
s
face
changed
no
i
don
t
ride
now
he
said
but
you
have
saturday
afternoons
free
oh
yes
there
are
three
in
the
stable
said
olive
making
a
sudden
resolve
and
only
one
of
them
gets
much
use
would
you
care
to
take
me
for
a
gallop
down
the
northboro
road
some
day
that
she
should
make
such
a
proposition
as
this
would
have
seemed
to
olive
townsend
but
an
hour
before
preposterous
but
now
looking
up
at
the
sturdy
figure
before
her
noting
the
wistful
smile
with
which
peter
had
spoken
of
past
experiences
it
had
come
to
her
all
at
once
that
a
new
pleasure
might
be
hers
she
saw
plainly
that
she
should
not
be
ashamed
of
peter
as
an
escort
anywhere
peter
stared
at
his
hostess
for
a
moment
as
if
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
had
heard
aright
do
you
really
mean
that
miss
townsend
he
asked
indeed
i
do
i
m
not
in
the
habit
of
saying
things
i
don
t
mean
then
thank
you
i
should
like
it
immensely
he
said
with
a
smile
and
bow
more
attractive
olive
admitted
to
herself
than
any
she
had
received
that
evening
chapter
vi
weeds
and
flowers
good
morning
miss
jane
bell
may
i
come
in
jane
lifted
her
head
quickly
from
over
the
she
was
weeding
in
the
little
garden
back
of
the
house
to
see
forrest
townsend
looking
over
the
wooden
gate
which
shut
away
the
garden
from
the
surrounding
neighborhood
good
morning
yes
indeed
come
in
she
responded
blithely
waving
a
discarded
white
ruffled
sunbonnet
at
her
guest
he
vaulted
over
the
low
barrier
and
came
swinging
down
the
narrow
path
to
the
end
of
the
enclosure
where
the
lay
here
he
stood
still
regarding
with
favour
the
girl
in
the
blue
dress
whose
hair
glinted
in
the
early
june
sunlight
always
busy
at
something
are
n
t
you
he
said
tipping
over
a
with
weeds
and
seating
himself
upon
it
yes
i
know
i
ve
spilled
out
the
weeds
but
i
ll
pick
em
up
again
when
i
m
through
i
came
over
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
you
and
i
ve
got
to
be
down
here
near
you
where
i
can
look
you
in
the
eye
the
grass
is
too
damp
yet
to
sit
on
in
white
trousers
jane
laughed
it
can
t
be
a
very
serious
matter
that
s
troubling
you
or
you
would
n
t
think
of
your
clothes
it
is
serious
though
i
m
full
of
it
and
can
t
stop
to
talk
about
the
weather
so
here
i
ve
quarrelled
with
my
father
jane
who
had
thus
far
not
ceased
her
weeding
stopped
work
and
sat
still
to
look
at
her
neighbour
he
met
her
gaze
defiantly
yes
i
know
you
think
this
is
another
case
of
schoolboy
heroics
like
the
last
fuss
i
told
you
i
had
with
him
i
wish
you
would
n
t
tell
me
i
ve
got
to
tell
somebody
come
jane
you
ve
grown
to
seem
like
the
best
friend
i
have
don
t
turn
the
cold
shoulder
on
me
just
when
i
need
you
you
know
what
my
mother
and
sister
are
like
with
a
gesture
of
disapproval
jane
turned
away
to
her
work
forrest
watched
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
began
again
all
right
i
won
t
complain
if
you
ll
just
let
me
tell
you
about
this
last
scrape
there
s
nobody
else
i
can
talk
to
you
know
enough
about
us
to
know
that
there
ought
to
be
your
brother
oh
murray
with
all
respect
to
him
since
you
insist
on
respect
he
s
not
off
the
same
piece
of
cloth
with
me
and
can
t
understand
me
any
more
than
i
can
him
his
blood
is
n
t
good
red
blood
at
all
it
s
white
i
think
and
i
jane
rose
up
from
her
knees
and
stood
above
her
visitor
determination
on
her
frank
face
forrest
townsend
said
she
if
you
can
talk
to
me
without
running
down
your
family
i
ll
listen
but
not
otherwise
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
your
affairs
at
all
but
if
you
re
sure
i
can
be
of
use
i
ll
hear
them
on
that
one
condition
forrest
studied
her
a
moment
without
replying
while
her
clear
hazel
eyes
returned
his
gaze
then
he
laughed
rather
awkwardly
you
re
the
soul
of
honour
are
n
t
you
he
said
and
that
s
just
why
i
need
your
advice
i
don
t
want
to
do
anything
dishonourable
but
i
m
in
a
corner
and
don
t
see
any
way
out
except
a
jump
over
the
wall
let
me
tell
you
please
jane
dropped
upon
her
knees
again
and
gave
her
attention
to
her
work
taking
this
as
permission
forrest
began
picking
up
a
long
weed
and
pulling
it
through
his
fingers
as
he
talked
i
ve
known
all
the
while
father
wanted
me
in
the
house
with
him
and
wanted
me
to
go
to
college
with
that
end
in
view
we
ve
had
a
few
brushes
on
the
subject
from
time
to
time
and
i
ve
told
him
over
and
over
i
never
meant
to
go
to
college
or
to
go
into
the
business
either
but
he
s
thought
it
boy
talk
i
suppose
anyhow
it
turns
out
he
s
never
taken
me
seriously
when
i
ve
told
him
i
meant
to
live
my
own
life
in
my
own
way
he
had
me
tutored
all
last
winter
to
get
me
ready
for
my
entrance
examinations
and
he
expects
me
to
go
down
and
take
them
next
week
that
s
where
i
balked
he
tackled
me
last
night
and
i
had
it
out
with
him
the
result
was
forrest
tried
to
keep
up
the
nonchalant
manner
he
had
assumed
when
he
began
this
explanation
but
his
voice
showed
his
strong
feeling
as
he
ended
the
sentence
the
result
was
he
gave
it
to
me
hot
and
heavy
and
i
talked
back
at
him
in
short
i
jane
her
pretty
lips
set
close
together
her
troubled
eyes
on
the
ground
listened
anxiously
for
the
words
you
don
t
mean
she
began
slowly
forrest
nodded
and
she
caught
the
gesture
it
brought
her
head
round
and
her
eyes
to
search
his
you
didn
t
say
you
wouldn
t
do
what
he
wants
i
did
and
meant
it
jane
drew
a
long
breath
she
forgot
her
weeding
and
sat
back
upon
the
walk
pulling
off
her
gloves
forrest
waited
silently
for
her
first
comment
imagine
my
brother
peter
doing
that
she
murmured
i
can
t
imagine
it
though
peter
s
no
but
your
father
s
human
jane
mine
isn
t
oh
he
is
he
is
don
t
say
that
he
may
seem
stern
and
hard
but
that
s
only
on
the
surface
i
m
sure
much
you
know
about
it
muttered
forrest
but
anyhow
hard
or
not
i
m
not
going
to
be
put
into
a
business
life
i
hate
what
would
you
like
to
do
go
into
the
army
jane
stared
at
him
astonished
this
idle
youth
live
that
sort
of
life
her
lips
curved
slowly
into
a
smile
at
which
forrest
promptly
took
umbrage
see
here
he
said
sitting
up
straight
you
re
not
to
judge
me
you
know
from
what
you
ve
seen
of
me
in
the
two
months
you
ve
lived
in
gay
street
i
ve
been
on
vacation
i
admit
ever
since
my
tutor
left
in
march
besides
it
s
not
enlisting
as
a
private
i
m
thinking
of
no
no
i
want
to
enter
the
army
by
the
way
of
west
point
and
get
my
lieutenant
s
commission
at
graduation
that
s
a
very
different
thing
yes
that
s
true
it
means
i
believe
four
years
of
the
severest
training
in
the
world
i
know
a
boy
who
went
he
could
n
t
stand
it
forrest
flushed
hotly
under
his
fair
skin
and
you
think
i
could
n
t
that
settles
it
i
ll
go
if
only
to
prove
you
re
mistaken
the
girl
looked
up
quickly
startled
by
his
tone
ah
please
she
began
don
t
talk
that
way
tell
me
will
your
brother
go
into
the
business
not
much
his
health
settles
that
for
him
besides
he
s
too
bookish
and
father
ll
let
him
do
what
he
pleases
anyway
he
does
n
t
mind
having
one
son
of
that
stripe
but
the
other
son
he
must
go
into
the
mill
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
could
you
get
to
west
point
without
your
father
s
permission
don
t
you
have
to
be
sent
by
somebody
your
congressman
is
n
t
it
oh
there
s
a
lot
of
red
tape
and
father
could
block
the
whole
game
i
suppose
if
he
does
well
i
d
enlist
and
get
into
the
ranks
and
work
my
way
up
rather
than
go
into
that
dingy
old
office
and
tie
myself
to
a
desk
and
a
telephone
forrest
got
upon
his
feet
as
he
spoke
brushed
a
clinging
weed
leaf
or
two
from
his
clothes
and
stood
looking
gloomily
down
at
jane
who
had
risen
also
it
s
evident
i
get
no
sympathy
from
you
he
said
i
thought
you
were
a
girl
who
could
understand
a
fellow
s
ambitions
not
them
jane
looked
up
at
him
smiling
although
her
eyes
were
still
troubled
i
can
i
think
she
said
yet
somehow
i
m
imagining
the
disappointment
it
must
be
to
a
father
who
has
built
up
a
great
business
like
townsend
company
s
to
have
his
son
take
no
interest
in
it
i
can
t
help
thinking
what
as
jane
paused
abruptly
never
mind
but
i
want
to
know
what
you
can
t
help
thinking
well
i
m
wondering
if
it
would
be
any
harder
for
you
to
go
into
your
father
s
office
than
it
is
for
peter
to
work
with
my
father
in
the
factory
do
you
know
what
peter
wants
to
be
no
i
know
he
has
a
good
position
for
his
age
with
the
armstrongs
yes
but
peter
wants
has
wanted
for
six
years
to
be
a
chemist
an
expert
you
know
oh
i
m
not
sure
i
ought
to
tell
you
please
never
speak
of
it
even
father
does
n
t
know
it
s
any
more
than
a
boy
s
fancy
peter
could
n
t
afford
the
years
of
training
of
course
and
father
can
t
spare
him
there
are
as
forrest
looked
surprised
more
people
dependent
on
father
and
the
boys
than
you
know
of
and
i
must
n
t
tell
you
all
i
want
you
to
know
is
that
jane
smiled
wistfully
there
are
other
people
who
can
t
have
their
own
way
and
who
are
making
the
best
of
it
and
pretty
bravely
too
bell
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
with
a
pleasant
nod
and
smile
to
forrest
told
jane
that
a
certain
bowl
of
had
reached
a
critical
condition
of
lightness
the
girl
picked
up
her
basket
and
forrest
bent
to
toss
into
it
the
weeds
he
had
thrown
out
please
don
t
feel
i
m
an
unsympathetic
listener
begged
jane
as
her
visitor
took
his
leave
i
won
t
i
know
you
mean
it
all
right
i
just
think
you
don
t
understand
all
the
facts
in
the
case
much
obliged
to
you
for
hearing
me
out
if
i
turn
up
missing
some
day
you
ll
know
you
did
your
part
and
gave
me
the
proper
grandmotherly
advice
and
forrest
swung
away
through
the
gate
with
a
reckless
air
which
jane
thought
rather
melodramatic
and
quite
in
keeping
with
a
certain
staginess
sometimes
apparent
in
the
youth
s
bearing
jane
s
acquaintance
with
olive
townsend
had
progressed
very
slowly
olive
was
not
a
girl
who
possessed
the
gift
of
making
many
warm
friendships
she
was
not
well
liked
even
by
the
young
people
of
her
own
chosen
circle
girl
visitors
were
not
frequent
at
the
townsend
house
and
olive
was
seldom
seen
coming
or
going
with
one
or
another
of
such
friends
yet
there
was
something
about
her
personality
which
held
a
strong
attraction
for
jane
and
made
her
want
to
know
olive
well
when
peter
returned
from
his
first
horseback
ride
in
olive
s
company
jane
had
waited
with
interest
for
his
description
of
the
event
peter
always
told
jane
his
experiences
for
the
reason
perhaps
that
she
never
demanded
them
from
him
never
betrayed
his
confidences
and
invariably
showed
her
appreciation
of
his
comradeship
she
s
an
odd
girl
said
peter
to
jane
she
seemed
principally
occupied
for
the
first
two
miles
in
noticing
how
i
rode
whether
i
kept
elbows
in
head
up
back
stiff
like
herself
and
whether
i
held
my
whip
in
the
proper
position
we
jogged
along
at
a
fussy
little
pace
talking
about
nothing
in
particular
and
minding
our
p
s
and
q
s
as
if
we
were
at
professor
miller
s
riding
academy
with
the
eye
of
the
master
on
us
i
hope
she
was
satisfied
with
your
correct
style
jane
said
i
saw
you
start
and
i
thought
you
looked
more
at
home
in
the
saddle
than
she
i
probably
am
after
riding
everything
on
grandfather
s
farm
ever
since
i
was
a
little
shaver
and
breaking
every
colt
he
had
for
the
three
years
we
lived
there
i
ought
to
feel
fairly
comfortable
on
a
model
like
the
one
she
gave
me
she
s
been
trained
in
the
school
which
leaves
a
lot
of
things
to
be
desired
to
my
way
of
thinking
she
broke
loose
all
right
though
when
i
got
my
chance
to
show
her
what
my
idea
of
the
sport
is
peter
s
face
took
on
a
comical
expression
and
jane
hurried
him
on
with
an
eager
well
we
got
out
on
the
northboro
road
you
know
that
long
stretch
where
there
are
so
few
houses
just
a
sort
of
lane
between
big
trees
shady
and
cool
and
the
road
like
a
at
this
time
of
year
jane
nodded
i
proposed
that
we
let
out
a
reef
or
two
she
agreed
and
we
broke
into
a
baby
canter
i
kept
hitting
up
the
pace
a
little
her
horse
caught
the
idea
and
began
to
quicken
she
bumped
about
a
bit
but
i
saw
she
would
know
how
to
stay
on
even
if
she
moved
faster
than
she
ever
had
before
just
as
we
got
up
a
fairly
decent
speed
one
of
those
little
of
came
bursting
out
of
a
driveway
and
both
our
horses
shied
and
threatened
to
bolt
it
was
nothing
you
know
they
were
over
it
in
a
jiffy
and
she
kept
her
seat
all
right
and
showed
she
was
game
but
it
stirred
both
horses
to
take
the
rest
of
that
stretch
at
as
pretty
a
gallop
as
you
d
care
to
see
and
when
i
saw
the
girl
was
all
right
i
shouted
come
on
and
let
them
have
it
i
tell
you
she
forgot
the
riding
academy
and
professor
miller
and
rode
for
fair
it
was
jolly
good
fun
and
she
enjoyed
it
too
peter
laughed
reminiscently
jane
remarked
that
she
had
noticed
olive
s
masses
of
black
hair
were
not
in
quite
such
trim
shape
when
she
came
home
from
that
ride
as
upon
setting
forth
and
peter
admitted
that
upon
that
joyous
gallop
she
had
dropped
not
only
her
whip
but
most
of
her
hairpins
of
which
latter
articles
he
had
been
able
to
recover
for
her
only
a
few
that
s
all
the
girl
needs
he
observed
sagely
just
shake
out
a
few
of
her
hairpins
each
time
you
re
with
her
and
she
ll
learn
how
to
be
good
friends
with
you
i
don
t
have
much
chance
to
shake
out
her
hairpins
jane
objected
you
will
you
re
to
go
next
time
some
day
when
her
brother
forrest
is
away
and
i
can
ride
his
horse
and
you
the
one
i
had
i
told
her
a
pitiful
tale
of
how
you
loved
to
ride
how
well
you
could
do
it
and
peter
oh
i
didn
t
whine
just
let
her
know
i
was
n
t
the
only
horseman
in
the
family
she
ll
ask
you
see
if
she
doesn
t
if
she
doesn
t
i
won
t
go
my
self
olive
did
not
ask
jane
however
and
after
one
more
ride
with
her
peter
suddenly
became
too
busy
to
accept
her
invitations
olive
went
off
by
herself
one
day
suffered
a
fall
and
a
sprained
shoulder
and
was
thereby
initiated
at
last
into
jane
s
friendship
my
sister
sent
me
over
said
murray
townsend
one
june
evening
to
jane
who
hemming
a
tiny
ruffle
sat
in
the
western
sunlight
upon
the
little
back
porch
where
the
family
now
spent
their
evenings
enjoying
the
first
blossomings
of
the
small
garden
she
s
been
fretting
all
day
with
that
shoulder
of
hers
she
hurt
last
week
and
vows
she
can
t
get
through
the
evening
with
me
the
others
are
all
away
as
usual
won
t
you
do
us
the
favour
of
coming
over
was
it
really
her
suggestion
or
yours
jane
challenged
him
for
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
made
the
attempt
upon
one
excuse
or
or
another
to
get
her
across
the
street
hers
on
my
honour
though
i
ll
admit
i
seconded
the
motion
she
really
wants
you
she
s
lying
on
a
couch
round
on
the
side
porch
it
s
a
jolly
place
or
would
be
if
it
had
you
in
it
he
nearly
said
but
discreetly
substituted
had
such
a
nice
crowd
in
it
as
this
he
glanced
from
one
to
another
of
the
group
upon
the
little
porch
ross
was
softly
breathing
notes
from
a
flute
and
bell
sat
side
by
side
in
happy
comradeship
peter
his
long
legs
extending
well
out
upon
the
grass
before
the
porch
whittled
at
a
bit
of
wood
and
nancy
close
beside
her
cousin
ross
was
holding
for
him
a
page
of
music
which
he
evidently
was
trying
for
the
first
time
stay
with
them
if
you
d
like
to
suggested
jane
softly
as
she
put
away
her
work
and
prepared
to
accept
his
invitation
you
know
they
always
like
to
have
you
every
one
of
them
and
i
can
slip
across
by
myself
i
ll
take
her
some
of
my
mignonette
and
june
roses
thank
you
for
your
kind
permission
answered
murray
following
jane
s
figure
slowly
down
to
the
at
the
farther
end
of
the
garden
but
i
d
rather
accept
it
some
evening
when
miss
jane
bell
is
to
be
at
home
hamlet
with
ophelia
left
out
would
n
t
be
much
more
of
a
play
than
it
would
be
minus
the
melancholy
gentleman
himself
armed
with
a
great
bunch
of
the
fragrant
blossoms
from
the
garden
jane
accompanied
murray
across
gay
street
through
the
gate
in
the
high
hedge
and
over
the
lawn
and
round
the
house
to
the
great
sheltered
porch
on
the
other
side
its
tall
columns
making
it
as
great
a
contrast
to
the
miniature
place
she
had
just
left
as
could
be
imagined
rugs
carpeted
the
floor
big
bamboo
and
rush
chairs
invited
repose
and
screens
hung
ready
to
be
dropped
and
to
shut
it
quite
away
from
invading
breezes
on
a
wide
richly
cushioned
settee
lay
olive
listless
and
unhappy
she
scanned
jane
closely
noted
that
her
visitor
was
not
less
attractively
if
far
less
expensively
dressed
than
herself
and
lifted
to
her
face
eyes
into
which
had
suddenly
come
a
look
of
relief
and
interest
for
me
she
asked
as
jane
put
the
flowers
into
her
outstretched
hands
oh
how
sweet
why
don
t
we
have
such
mignonette
as
that
in
our
gardens
there
are
a
lot
of
flowers
thought
murray
as
he
watched
jane
take
her
seat
by
his
sister
and
begin
to
entertain
her
that
they
grow
in
gay
street
which
we
don
t
know
the
smell
of
over
here
if
we
could
just
transplant
the
one
i
brought
over
what
a
beginning
of
a
garden
we
should
have
chapter
vii
jane
puts
a
question
on
her
way
home
from
a
trip
to
a
not
nancy
bell
caught
sight
of
her
friend
shirley
townsend
waving
an
eagerly
summoning
hand
from
the
gateway
in
the
hedge
it
was
a
hot
morning
in
early
july
and
nancy
after
running
into
the
house
to
report
her
return
to
her
mother
joined
shirley
in
a
shady
corner
under
the
shrubbery
which
had
become
a
favourite
of
the
two
children
half
an
hour
afterward
nancy
her
eyes
wide
with
excitement
sought
out
her
mother
and
jane
upon
the
small
back
porch
where
each
was
busy
with
the
morning
s
work
at
this
moment
the
of
raspberries
and
the
shelling
of
peas
o
mother
o
jane
the
child
began
the
dreadfullest
thing
has
happened
over
at
the
big
house
forrest
townsend
s
run
away
and
they
don
t
know
where
he
is
why
nan
jane
s
busy
fingers
red
with
raspberry
stains
stopped
their
work
as
she
stared
at
her
sister
in
dismay
that
can
t
be
so
yes
it
can
it
is
shirley
told
me
he
s
been
gone
three
days
but
they
thought
he
must
be
off
on
a
visit
till
they
got
a
letter
this
morning
and
they
don
t
even
know
where
the
letter
was
mailed
from
townsend
s
sick
in
bed
about
it
and
shirley
says
her
father
won
t
say
a
word
just
looks
white
and
angry
and
queer
the
poor
father
and
mother
murmured
bell
her
eyes
full
of
sympathy
but
he
can
t
have
gone
away
to
stay
said
jane
staring
at
nancy
still
incredulous
he
s
an
impulsive
fellow
quick
tempered
and
he
and
his
father
don
t
get
on
well
together
but
to
run
away
but
he
has
persisted
nancy
the
letter
said
it
was
no
use
looking
for
him
he
d
come
back
some
time
when
he
d
shown
he
could
look
after
his
own
oh
i
don
t
remember
just
what
he
said
shirley
was
n
t
sure
what
it
meant
but
she
said
her
mother
just
cried
and
cried
and
told
her
father
she
d
always
known
his
harsh
ways
don
t
dear
don
t
tell
us
bell
interrupted
quickly
shirley
should
n
t
have
told
you
anything
that
was
said
we
have
no
right
to
know
when
people
are
hurt
and
sad
they
say
bitter
things
they
are
very
sorry
for
afterward
the
only
thing
for
us
to
know
is
that
this
trouble
has
come
to
our
neighbours
we
must
think
how
we
can
help
them
i
would
go
over
at
once
if
i
thought
i
could
be
of
use
to
poor
townsend
and
were
sure
she
was
willing
i
should
know
they
discussed
the
situation
bell
and
jane
as
they
went
on
with
their
work
and
jane
told
her
mother
all
she
knew
of
forrest
s
differences
with
his
father
it
bothers
me
so
she
ended
sorrowfully
that
i
did
n
t
realise
he
was
in
earnest
about
taking
things
into
his
own
hands
and
do
something
to
let
the
others
know
do
you
suppose
that
foolish
threat
about
enlisting
in
the
army
could
really
have
been
what
he
meant
to
do
do
you
suppose
he
has
done
it
it
is
a
possible
clue
i
think
they
ought
to
know
it
if
they
have
nothing
else
to
guide
them
when
your
father
comes
home
i
will
talk
with
him
about
it
and
he
may
think
it
best
to
go
to
townsend
himself
tell
him
what
we
know
and
offer
to
help
but
it
proved
not
necessary
to
wait
until
the
evening
to
consult
about
offering
sympathy
and
counsel
to
the
troubled
family
in
worthington
square
early
in
the
afternoon
while
bell
lay
resting
in
her
room
and
nancy
and
jane
sat
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
big
maples
at
the
end
of
the
garden
their
special
retreat
on
hot
days
the
tap
of
murray
s
cane
was
heard
on
the
walk
outside
run
into
the
house
dear
please
jane
whispered
quickly
it
s
murray
and
i
believe
he
s
come
to
talk
with
me
about
forrest
her
surmise
proved
correct
as
she
knew
from
her
first
glance
at
the
pale
face
and
grave
eyes
of
her
friend
he
was
her
friend
that
she
had
come
to
know
very
clearly
in
the
last
few
weeks
her
friend
in
quite
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
forrest
had
shown
her
friendship
there
had
developed
a
genuine
congeniality
of
interests
between
the
quiet
youth
and
the
girl
who
had
not
gone
to
college
but
who
was
persistently
giving
herself
the
higher
education
she
longed
for
books
he
was
lending
her
lessons
in
french
and
german
he
had
been
lately
begging
to
be
allowed
to
give
her
and
many
inspiring
talks
he
had
with
her
on
the
subjects
both
loved
whenever
a
chance
offered
or
he
could
make
one
so
now
as
murray
came
toward
her
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
as
if
he
were
sure
that
here
he
would
find
something
he
sorely
needed
jane
felt
an
added
longing
to
show
her
power
to
be
of
use
in
time
of
trouble
and
dropping
her
book
one
that
belonged
to
murray
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
look
which
showed
him
that
she
already
understood
you
ve
heard
he
asked
in
surprise
i
don
t
know
how
but
i
m
glad
for
i
dreaded
to
tell
it
shirley
told
nancy
just
the
bare
facts
and
of
course
my
little
sister
told
my
mother
and
me
we
ve
been
thinking
of
you
all
ever
since
wishing
we
could
help
you
you
can
we
need
you
even
mother
feels
it
olive
says
when
she
asked
her
if
she
wanted
a
nurse
she
refused
to
have
one
except
her
maid
but
said
i
wish
i
dared
to
ask
that
bell
i
feel
as
if
she
could
tell
me
what
to
mother
will
be
so
glad
she
will
go
over
by
and
by
she
loves
to
help
people
and
always
knows
how
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
i
can
believe
it
she
makes
a
fellow
feel
as
if
he
belonged
to
her
somehow
and
she
was
interested
in
him
she
is
that
s
why
she
makes
you
feel
come
over
here
in
the
shade
please
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
murray
dropped
upon
the
grass
beside
jane
s
low
chair
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
and
ran
his
hand
through
the
thick
locks
of
his
hair
pushing
them
away
from
his
forehead
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
if
he
would
like
thus
easily
to
clear
away
the
clouds
which
bothered
him
you
see
he
began
slowly
i
feel
more
or
less
responsible
myself
for
this
outbreak
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
if
things
had
been
between
us
as
they
ought
to
be
between
brothers
forrest
would
have
brought
his
notions
and
troubles
to
me
but
you
but
he
jane
paused
surprised
at
the
tone
he
took
you
have
n
t
been
able
to
be
with
forrest
much
because
because
he
has
been
so
active
and
lived
such
a
different
life
you
are
kind
to
excuse
me
but
i
don
t
see
how
that
makes
it
any
better
i
could
have
shown
interest
and
sympathy
enough
with
his
tastes
and
plans
to
have
made
him
come
naturally
to
me
i
m
the
elder
brother
and
i
have
n
t
been
a
brother
only
a
querulous
elderly
relative
as
if
he
were
fourteen
and
i
forty
he
did
come
to
you
with
his
grievances
against
father
did
n
t
he
jane
coloured
a
little
as
his
eyes
keenly
questioned
her
yes
though
i
did
n
t
want
him
to
tell
me
and
would
n
t
listen
to
very
much
of
it
i
felt
guilty
to
let
him
talk
at
all
but
he
was
so
i
m
glad
you
did
if
anybody
could
have
given
him
advice
that
he
would
take
it
would
have
been
you
i
was
pretty
sure
he
had
been
to
you
by
the
way
i
saw
him
fling
over
here
just
after
he
d
had
a
bout
with
father
he
said
something
that
day
i
feel
as
if
your
father
ought
to
know
and
i
ve
been
wondering
how
i
could
let
him
know
and
with
this
introduction
jane
told
murray
all
she
had
learned
of
forrest
s
inclination
toward
the
army
and
its
varied
experiences
ending
as
gently
as
she
could
with
the
boyish
threat
of
enlisting
if
he
could
not
bring
about
his
own
appointment
to
west
point
murray
listened
to
her
very
soberly
father
would
veto
the
west
point
proposition
from
the
first
word
he
said
merely
because
he
has
no
notion
of
the
sort
of
fascination
the
idea
would
have
for
a
restless
chap
like
my
brother
so
if
forrest
asked
him
to
let
him
go
i
ve
no
doubt
he
refused
him
and
then
well
i
can
easily
imagine
forrest
carrying
out
his
threat
out
of
pure
bravado
it
gives
us
something
to
go
by
anyhow
we
can
soon
find
out
if
he
s
had
the
folly
to
enlist
he
may
have
the
dash
and
bravery
to
do
a
gallant
deed
to
fight
stoutly
enough
at
a
time
of
need
but
the
patience
and
endurance
for
the
army
life
he
shook
his
head
he
s
only
a
boy
you
know
you
could
n
t
expect
it
of
him
just
here
peter
opened
the
little
garden
gate
and
came
swinging
in
hello
he
called
at
sight
of
the
pair
under
the
you
two
look
cool
and
restful
out
there
may
i
join
the
picnic
party
when
i
ve
freshened
up
a
bit
a
breakdown
in
the
power
at
the
factory
sent
fifty
or
sixty
of
us
in
our
department
home
for
a
that
s
luck
for
us
too
called
back
murray
cordially
jane
bent
forward
eagerly
do
you
mind
peter
s
knowing
she
asked
pete
s
so
big
and
strong
and
ingenious
he
s
like
mother
at
knowing
what
to
do
i
want
peter
to
know
murray
replied
without
hesitation
we
re
going
to
try
to
keep
this
thing
out
of
the
papers
of
course
and
away
from
our
acquaintances
as
long
as
we
can
but
your
family
must
all
know
i
feel
somehow
as
if
having
the
bell
family
stand
by
us
would
be
worth
a
lot
when
peter
came
out
in
fresh
clothes
his
brown
hair
damp
from
the
splashing
shower
he
had
just
taken
and
joined
the
two
others
under
the
maple
he
was
told
the
whole
story
he
listened
in
gravity
with
once
or
twice
a
short
exclamation
of
regret
as
murray
ended
with
jane
s
suggestion
about
the
runaway
s
possible
enlistment
in
the
army
peter
drew
a
long
breath
i
believe
i
can
understand
how
he
felt
about
it
he
said
throwing
his
head
back
and
staring
up
at
the
sky
for
a
moment
then
coming
back
to
earth
with
a
squaring
of
his
broad
shoulders
he
added
with
a
rueful
smile
at
jane
and
that
s
not
because
my
home
is
n
t
the
happiest
one
on
earth
it
s
just
the
feeling
a
fellow
gets
once
in
a
while
that
he
d
like
to
jump
over
something
and
make
a
dash
for
the
horizon
line
to
see
what
s
beyond
it
and
i
can
see
how
he
then
he
broke
off
suddenly
looking
at
murray
that
does
n
t
mean
i
don
t
appreciate
what
this
is
to
all
his
family
and
if
there
s
anything
i
can
do
to
help
i
m
your
man
you
d
be
a
good
one
to
send
after
him
murray
answered
with
a
slight
smile
you
d
know
better
than
to
pounce
on
him
like
an
officer
of
the
law
you
d
treat
him
like
a
brother
a
better
brother
than
i
ve
been
and
the
smile
faded
look
here
don
t
take
it
that
way
there
are
few
brothers
i
know
who
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
they
ought
to
do
it
s
odd
but
it
s
so
and
a
pity
it
is
too
i
think
our
family
is
different
from
most
for
the
reason
here
peter
stopped
abruptly
once
more
meeting
jane
s
eyes
he
could
not
say
that
early
training
given
by
wise
parents
had
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
with
their
family
life
yes
i
fancy
i
know
the
reason
said
murray
wistfully
and
i
congratulate
you
on
it
i
m
a
stupid
sort
of
job
s
comforter
peter
went
on
but
one
thing
is
sure
if
you
d
like
an
extra
brother
to
stand
by
in
this
difficulty
here
he
is
he
laid
his
hand
on
murray
s
arm
as
he
spoke
and
murray
flushed
with
pleasure
he
turned
and
held
out
his
own
hand
and
peter
s
closed
on
it
with
a
grip
then
both
began
to
talk
with
a
will
about
other
things
when
murray
went
home
he
took
bell
with
him
he
watched
her
vanish
through
the
doorway
of
his
mother
s
room
where
that
poor
lady
had
been
all
day
in
a
state
of
nervous
prostration
and
felt
that
he
had
brought
her
a
friend
worth
while
the
moment
that
his
father
came
home
murray
went
to
him
with
the
news
he
had
obtained
in
gay
street
the
two
had
a
long
conference
during
which
murray
discovered
his
father
to
be
watching
him
with
a
peculiar
expression
as
if
surprised
to
find
this
reserved
son
so
ready
with
suggestions
townsend
shook
his
head
over
the
notion
that
forrest
could
have
carried
his
revolt
against
authority
so
far
as
to
have
taken
the
step
of
enlisting
in
the
army
but
when
murray
urged
that
the
clue
should
be
followed
up
the
elder
man
said
slowly
i
don
t
know
whether
it
would
do
any
good
to
hunt
him
up
and
bring
him
home
he
s
taken
things
into
his
own
hands
i
feel
like
letting
him
manage
his
own
affairs
for
a
while
he
has
n
t
the
force
of
character
to
deprive
himself
of
the
comforts
of
life
very
long
if
he
has
enlisted
he
d
better
take
the
consequences
i
m
not
so
sure
but
a
term
of
service
in
the
army
would
do
him
good
take
the
conceit
out
of
him
and
show
him
that
he
can
not
escape
discipline
anywhere
life
itself
means
discipline
of
one
sort
or
another
if
we
should
find
he
had
enlisted
then
you
wouldn
t
take
the
steps
to
get
him
off
you
could
you
know
sir
since
he
s
under
age
peter
says
so
peter
peter
who
peter
bell
in
gay
street
oh
yes
you
see
a
good
deal
of
the
bells
murray
yes
sir
i
don
t
think
i
should
apply
to
have
him
released
from
service
said
townsend
slowly
grim
lines
settling
about
his
mouth
a
week
went
by
at
its
close
a
second
briefly
letter
arrived
from
forrest
addressed
to
his
mother
it
stated
that
forrest
had
enlisted
in
the
army
and
had
at
his
own
application
been
allowed
to
join
a
regiment
just
leaving
for
san
francisco
to
be
sent
for
a
term
of
three
years
service
in
the
philippines
by
the
time
the
letter
reached
home
forrest
would
have
sailed
the
letter
was
written
in
a
spirit
of
boyish
bravado
like
the
first
but
although
it
upset
townsend
again
and
sent
her
back
to
her
bed
it
relieved
the
tension
of
the
family
it
furnished
definite
news
of
the
young
fellow
s
whereabouts
and
made
it
possible
to
communicate
with
him
when
he
should
have
reached
his
destination
townsend
spent
many
days
thereafter
in
urging
her
husband
to
apply
at
headquarters
to
have
her
son
returned
it
could
be
done
she
was
sure
because
the
boy
was
but
nineteen
and
having
enlisted
without
his
father
s
permission
must
have
misrepresented
his
age
at
the
but
townsend
remained
firm
he
said
that
forrest
having
chosen
this
course
must
abide
by
it
at
least
for
the
term
of
service
for
which
he
had
enlisted
he
would
not
have
a
turncoat
for
a
son
he
said
sternly
although
with
a
suspicious
lowering
of
the
voice
and
he
was
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
the
hard
realities
of
life
would
make
a
man
out
of
forrest
if
the
stuff
of
which
men
are
made
was
in
him
meanwhile
he
said
to
murray
with
a
sadness
which
the
other
detected
it
is
the
father
rather
than
the
son
after
all
who
has
the
bitterest
dose
of
medicine
to
take
i
m
sorry
sir
was
all
murray
could
say
wondering
if
his
father
meant
the
fact
that
his
plan
for
taking
forrest
into
the
business
would
have
to
be
given
up
he
suggested
this
to
jane
bell
in
the
little
garden
one
evening
down
by
the
where
she
had
gone
to
pick
a
bunch
of
flowers
for
olive
who
sat
upon
the
porch
with
ross
and
peter
olive
had
at
last
learned
the
way
over
to
gay
street
and
having
found
it
had
discovered
that
the
knowledge
lent
interest
to
a
life
she
had
felt
to
be
very
dull
i
suppose
he
feels
badly
about
it
said
murray
holding
the
phlox
jane
gave
him
while
she
picked
a
cluster
of
lilies
to
go
with
it
indeed
he
must
it
is
the
thing
he
has
looked
forward
to
for
years
ever
since
he
realised
he
could
n
t
make
a
business
man
out
of
me
yes
and
i
suppose
even
if
your
brother
came
back
after
two
or
three
years
less
than
now
he
might
not
be
any
more
willing
to
settle
down
to
that
life
no
i
doubt
if
he
would
it
s
all
up
for
father
and
it
s
a
tremendous
disappointment
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
him
said
jane
gravely
musing
over
her
lilies
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
looked
up
you
don
t
think
she
ventured
her
hazel
eyes
scanning
his
that
anybody
could
possibly
make
it
up
to
him
anybody
who
who
indeed
jane
was
breathing
a
little
quickly
murray
stared
at
her
in
mingled
astonishment
questioning
and
dismay
then
he
spoke
abruptly
and
roughly
in
the
name
of
all
absurdity
you
can
t
mean
jane
dropped
her
eyes
flushing
deeply
she
bit
her
lips
it
would
be
very
very
hard
would
n
t
it
murray
drew
a
deep
impatient
breath
he
exploded
and
turned
away
then
he
wheeled
back
you
re
not
serious
he
said
hurriedly
you
can
t
be
serious
in
even
suggesting
such
a
thing
i
bookworm
cripple
weakling
jane
raised
her
eyes
once
more
in
the
deepening
twilight
murray
felt
as
if
they
were
searching
his
soul
and
yet
she
said
slowly
and
almost
wistfully
it
would
be
such
a
magnificent
thing
to
do
it
would
take
hero
stuff
i
know
yet
she
smiled
i
think
you
could
then
she
stopped
short
oh
forgive
me
she
cried
softly
under
her
breath
what
am
i
that
i
should
suggest
hero
deeds
to
you
a
girl
who
cries
nearly
every
night
of
her
life
because
she
can
t
go
to
college
chapter
viii
murray
gives
an
answer
i
wish
i
knew
observed
olive
townsend
to
jane
bell
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
murray
he
acts
as
if
he
had
lost
his
head
completely
i
went
into
his
room
this
morning
and
almost
fell
over
a
pile
of
indian
clubs
and
and
i
saw
a
set
of
chest
weights
hanging
against
the
wall
it
s
the
queerest
thing
he
s
never
gone
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
at
all
and
i
shouldn
t
think
he
was
strong
enough
for
it
either
the
two
girls
were
driving
along
the
park
roadway
in
a
phaeton
of
olive
s
behind
a
very
smartly
harnessed
horse
this
was
the
third
time
olive
had
asked
jane
to
drive
with
her
and
although
jane
would
have
enjoyed
excursions
into
the
country
much
more
than
these
drives
about
the
fashionable
city
streets
she
appreciated
the
honour
olive
meant
to
do
her
in
thus
exhibiting
their
friendship
to
all
beholders
olive
had
grown
to
be
rather
proud
of
jane
s
company
upon
these
drives
for
she
was
conscious
that
they
attracted
considerable
admiring
attention
and
she
fancied
that
jane
s
quiet
daintiness
of
attire
set
off
her
own
rather
more
striking
style
jane
laughed
at
the
notion
that
murray
was
not
strong
enough
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
being
stronger
she
knew
it
was
peter
who
had
suggested
this
course
of
proceedings
in
response
to
an
envious
comment
from
murray
when
he
had
seen
peter
scantily
garbed
for
some
severe
physical
labor
about
the
house
biceps
peter
had
laughed
as
murray
grasped
the
sinewy
arm
and
expressed
his
admiration
for
the
fine
development
thereof
and
deltoid
oh
yes
that
s
easy
if
your
particular
form
of
daily
toil
does
n
t
give
you
muscle
where
you
want
it
get
it
for
yourself
with
exercise
you
can
build
up
anything
you
like
in
a
gymnasium
or
in
your
own
room
if
you
have
the
persistence
you
could
with
your
splendid
health
to
begin
on
of
course
murray
replied
with
a
sigh
for
he
had
begun
to
suspect
that
peter
s
unusual
and
efficiency
came
in
considerable
degree
from
his
body
so
could
you
a
year
of
solid
work
with
a
good
instructor
would
make
another
chap
of
you
two
years
an
athlete
oh
no
not
with
my
constitution
your
constitution
man
peter
had
almost
shouted
what
s
constitution
something
to
be
made
just
about
what
you
will
of
fellows
with
a
direct
tendency
toward
consumption
have
made
themselves
giants
by
living
outdoors
and
sawing
wood
this
had
been
the
beginning
the
first
result
of
which
serious
talk
had
been
the
and
which
had
called
forth
olive
s
suspicion
of
her
brother
s
sanity
but
he
s
never
cared
for
anything
but
books
and
to
be
let
alone
objected
olive
when
jane
replied
that
she
thought
nothing
better
could
happen
to
murray
than
to
become
interested
in
building
up
his
physical
being
it
s
just
since
forrest
has
been
gone
only
think
that
s
six
weeks
now
that
murray
has
been
at
this
it
s
telling
on
him
already
too
said
jane
feeling
a
sense
of
elation
over
the
fact
which
she
could
not
quite
account
for
he
has
a
better
colour
i
noticed
it
yesterday
that
was
sunburn
declared
olive
skeptically
he
spent
the
afternoon
lying
on
the
ground
with
a
book
down
by
the
hedge
right
squarely
in
the
hot
august
sun
i
think
it
was
ridiculous
he
s
lived
in
the
house
ever
so
much
more
than
was
good
for
him
jane
insisted
gently
so
does
everybody
in
cities
my
idea
of
happiness
one
sort
is
a
day
on
my
grandfather
s
farm
it
s
only
about
ten
miles
out
and
we
ve
a
plan
should
you
murray
and
shirley
care
to
spend
a
day
with
us
out
there
a
sort
of
picnic
you
know
down
by
the
river
there
are
the
loveliest
places
you
can
imagine
and
peter
says
he
ll
take
you
fishing
if
you
care
for
it
indeed
i
should
i
m
sure
agreed
olive
with
real
pleasure
she
loved
new
sensations
and
the
notion
of
going
fishing
with
peter
bell
appealed
to
her
strongly
she
was
growing
more
and
more
to
respect
and
admire
peter
in
a
way
it
was
true
in
which
she
quite
failed
to
appreciate
his
best
qualities
but
in
which
she
responded
nevertheless
to
those
which
his
family
would
have
rated
as
his
second
best
don
t
forget
the
picnic
was
olive
s
last
word
as
she
set
jane
down
at
her
own
door
i
shall
begin
to
get
an
outing
hat
ready
now
if
i
should
forget
peter
would
remind
me
it
s
his
plan
jane
reassured
her
a
fact
which
of
itself
pleased
olive
for
she
was
confident
that
it
meant
his
regard
for
her
entertainment
if
she
had
known
however
the
whole
plan
was
a
plot
of
peter
s
for
murray
s
diversion
the
fellow
s
worrying
about
something
peter
had
said
he
s
pitching
into
the
exercises
i
showed
him
but
his
mind
s
counting
against
him
i
know
what
he
wants
to
build
himself
up
for
he
told
me
that
if
he
had
to
be
the
family
s
sole
representative
in
the
matter
of
sons
for
the
next
three
years
he
wanted
to
put
up
a
better
showing
and
i
m
decidedly
glad
he
takes
it
that
way
i
d
hate
myself
to
be
five
feet
ten
and
weigh
only
one
hundred
and
thirty
let
s
take
him
and
the
girls
if
you
like
out
for
a
day
on
grandfather
bell
s
farm
what
do
you
say
do
you
suppose
we
could
make
the
thing
acceptable
to
miss
worthington
square
after
due
consideration
of
the
matter
and
some
consultation
with
her
mother
jane
had
enthusiastically
agreed
now
upon
returning
from
the
drive
she
was
able
to
tell
peter
that
olive
had
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
what
fishing
and
all
he
laughed
really
i
think
better
of
her
ladyship
than
ever
for
coming
down
to
earth
like
that
the
question
is
now
how
to
get
them
there
without
resorting
to
a
form
of
conveyance
i
judge
miss
olive
would
n
t
deign
to
accept
imagine
one
rolling
up
to
the
on
the
worthington
square
front
and
jane
broke
into
such
a
merry
laugh
that
everybody
joined
in
for
jane
had
told
peter
her
news
at
the
let
miss
olive
and
murray
and
shirley
drive
in
their
own
trap
and
have
pete
bring
out
grandfather
s
new
surrey
for
us
i
m
sure
it
s
as
trim
a
looking
vehicle
as
any
if
his
horses
don
t
have
quite
the
smartest
harness
going
suggested
ross
mcandrew
the
horses
themselves
are
that
will
have
to
do
i
think
jane
agreed
though
it
seems
too
bad
to
ask
our
guests
to
take
themselves
no
matter
in
what
order
we
go
you
ll
find
we
ll
come
home
democratically
mixed
up
prophesied
ross
i
defy
miss
worthington
square
to
withstand
the
leveling
influences
of
a
day
on
grandfather
bell
s
farm
i
ve
no
doubt
peter
will
drive
the
trap
home
with
rufe
hanging
on
the
back
seat
and
murray
will
learn
what
it
means
to
coax
a
pair
of
shy
farm
horses
past
the
electric
cars
as
for
me
i
may
come
home
as
jockey
on
young
major
s
back
the
city
youth
having
proved
not
up
to
the
situation
with
such
merry
comments
the
preparation
for
the
picnic
was
made
and
if
the
bells
had
known
it
their
guests
looked
forward
to
the
affair
with
quite
as
pleasant
anticipations
as
themselves
when
the
day
came
a
sultry
august
morning
with
signs
of
in
the
west
olive
and
murray
and
shirley
found
themselves
as
willing
to
risk
a
possible
wetting
as
the
bells
themselves
who
never
minded
such
small
things
as
in
the
least
the
farm
horses
grandfather
bell
s
pride
and
with
reason
for
they
were
a
fine
pair
of
blacks
led
the
way
the
new
surrey
carrying
such
a
jolly
company
that
the
guests
following
close
behind
in
the
smart
trap
tried
in
vain
to
rival
their
hilarity
the
three
townsends
were
all
arrayed
in
white
linen
from
head
to
foot
and
presented
a
cool
and
attractive
spectacle
but
murray
s
eyes
watched
with
envy
the
group
in
the
conveyance
ahead
and
olive
reluctantly
owned
to
herself
that
jane
s
fresh
little
blue
cotton
frock
while
better
suited
to
a
farm
picnic
than
one
of
white
linen
was
also
a
charming
spot
of
colour
upon
the
landscape
now
who
s
going
fishing
called
back
peter
as
he
drove
his
steeds
briskly
in
through
grandfather
bell
s
gateway
followed
by
the
trap
at
its
best
pace
it
s
clouding
over
now
so
that
we
ought
to
have
some
good
sport
if
the
rain
holds
off
and
i
think
it
will
judging
by
the
wind
grandfather
bell
can
tell
us
that
he
added
as
a
tall
old
man
of
a
hale
and
vigorous
aspect
came
out
of
the
house
to
greet
his
guests
the
rain
won
t
bother
you
before
afternoon
i
guess
prophesied
grandfather
bell
shaking
hands
cordially
with
his
guests
when
it
does
you
d
better
put
for
the
house
you
can
have
your
picnic
indoors
where
you
won
t
get
your
clothes
wet
and
his
glance
fell
on
the
three
young
people
from
the
city
never
mind
our
clothes
said
murray
we
were
thinking
of
the
hot
day
coming
when
we
put
them
on
it
would
have
been
more
sensible
to
dress
like
you
fellows
and
he
glanced
from
ross
s
worn
gray
corduroys
to
peter
s
faded
blue
flannels
in
which
costumes
both
young
men
looked
ruggedly
and
not
unattractively
ready
for
roughing
it
picnics
appeal
to
people
from
different
points
of
view
suggested
ross
now
miss
olive
can
certainly
sit
on
a
rock
and
watch
peter
rufe
nan
and
myself
fish
giving
us
practical
suggestions
from
time
to
time
in
a
whisper
perhaps
she
ll
photograph
us
with
that
camera
she
has
there
but
i
would
advise
that
murray
townsend
miss
shirley
townsend
and
miss
jane
bell
sit
apart
on
some
mossy
bank
and
read
some
pleasant
tale
fishing
nonsense
you
talk
like
a
stage
manager
jeered
peter
miss
olive
s
going
to
do
some
real
fishing
if
grandmother
bell
has
to
lend
her
a
dress
to
go
home
in
and
so
are
the
rest
fishing
is
the
first
thing
on
this
programme
and
fishing
is
to
be
done
you
saw
to
the
rods
and
lines
rufe
where
are
they
rufe
raced
away
to
the
barns
and
came
back
with
a
full
fishing
equipment
for
everybody
after
greeting
grandmother
bell
a
pleasant
little
old
lady
with
a
warm
welcome
for
every
one
the
party
proceeded
through
the
orchard
and
down
a
long
lane
to
the
river
a
picturesque
spot
which
had
been
the
paradise
of
the
bell
family
from
its
earliest
recollections
here
sport
reigned
for
an
hour
although
few
fish
were
caught
the
spirit
of
hilarity
ruled
the
holiday
too
thoroughly
to
admit
of
much
wooing
of
the
frightened
prey
but
nobody
minded
except
rufus
who
finally
left
the
others
and
wandered
away
whence
he
returned
after
a
time
triumphant
with
a
respectable
showing
of
fish
the
clouds
don
t
look
as
threatening
as
they
did
could
n
t
we
climb
that
small
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
i
ve
been
looking
at
that
winding
path
for
an
hour
wishing
i
could
see
where
it
leads
said
murray
to
jane
propping
his
against
a
tree
it
leads
to
a
little
hemlock
grove
and
a
field
of
corn
beyond
answered
jane
fanning
her
flushed
and
laughing
face
with
her
hat
oh
don
t
tell
me
come
and
explore
it
with
me
will
you
murray
gave
her
such
a
pleading
look
that
she
could
not
refuse
him
although
she
and
peter
had
agreed
that
this
picnic
was
not
to
be
a
pairing
off
affair
because
that
would
leave
ross
in
the
lurch
and
ross
had
been
working
hard
of
late
and
needed
an
outing
his
cousins
thought
more
than
anybody
we
ll
just
go
over
and
back
if
you
like
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
and
jane
let
him
walk
away
with
her
they
slowly
climbed
the
hill
path
murray
stopping
to
cut
himself
a
stout
staff
in
lieu
of
the
cane
he
no
longer
used
i
shall
always
be
lame
he
said
to
jane
but
i
m
not
going
to
depend
on
canes
any
longer
except
for
such
special
occasions
as
this
do
you
know
i
think
i
m
growing
a
shade
brawnier
thanks
to
peter
s
training
i
m
sure
you
are
you
look
it
responded
jane
warmly
and
i
m
so
glad
there
has
been
wonderful
work
done
in
the
world
by
people
in
ill
health
but
i
m
afraid
i
could
never
be
a
carlyle
or
a
stevenson
no
matter
how
bright
the
fires
of
genius
burned
they
worked
for
the
love
of
it
but
when
the
task
a
fellow
sees
before
him
is
one
he
dislikes
he
certainly
needs
the
backing
of
a
sound
body
as
they
attained
the
top
of
the
hill
panting
a
little
for
breath
murray
stared
ahead
into
the
hemlock
grove
that
s
a
spot
can
t
we
sit
down
there
a
few
minutes
i
ll
have
to
rest
a
bit
before
i
do
more
he
urged
it
s
three
years
since
i
climbed
a
hill
like
that
just
the
day
before
i
had
my
accident
i
seem
to
have
got
started
on
the
uninteresting
subject
of
myself
so
i
may
as
well
go
on
a
little
further
and
tell
you
my
plans
about
the
same
chap
if
you
don
t
mind
listening
i
d
love
to
hear
them
here
s
a
fine
mossy
spot
and
two
trees
to
lean
against
and
jane
dropped
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
trees
she
had
pointed
out
murray
casting
aside
his
stick
threw
himself
down
at
full
length
near
by
his
arms
clasped
under
his
head
ah
this
is
great
he
murmured
smell
those
balsams
it
makes
one
want
to
live
outdoors
and
that
s
what
i
m
thinking
of
doing
really
how
will
you
pitch
a
tent
on
the
lawn
that
would
be
fine
for
you
and
we
should
all
envy
you
no
i
want
a
more
radical
change
to
outdoor
life
than
that
or
at
least
i
want
the
results
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
that
to
live
my
life
out
as
a
bookish
invalid
if
i
might
do
better
is
too
poor
a
way
of
playing
the
game
of
life
as
one
author
i
like
immensely
puts
it
i
shall
stick
to
the
books
all
i
can
but
i
want
some
good
red
blood
in
my
veins
besides
forrest
s
words
spoken
weeks
ago
charging
murray
with
the
very
lack
of
red
blood
came
to
jane
s
mind
and
she
smiled
and
sighed
thinking
what
a
change
those
weeks
had
made
in
the
relations
of
the
two
brothers
and
here
was
murray
wishing
for
the
very
thing
the
want
of
which
his
vigorous
brother
had
deplored
i
m
sure
you
can
have
it
and
all
the
good
things
that
go
with
it
which
are
many
as
you
people
have
already
taught
me
honestly
it
s
seeing
your
family
so
alive
and
hearty
and
happy
that
s
brought
me
to
be
dissatisfied
with
myself
i
m
going
to
have
need
of
all
i
can
put
into
murray
townsend
and
so
i
ve
about
made
up
my
mind
he
hesitated
pulling
a
hemlock
branch
through
his
slim
fingers
with
nervous
energy
then
he
began
again
i
ve
been
reading
a
lot
lately
about
life
on
one
of
those
western
ranches
real
ranch
life
i
mean
not
eastern
play
at
it
i
ve
a
cousin
who
went
to
montana
six
years
ago
i
get
a
letter
from
him
once
in
a
while
he
s
a
westerner
now
i
doubt
if
he
ever
comes
east
again
to
stay
i
ve
written
him
to
ask
if
he
has
any
room
for
a
tenderfoot
on
his
ranch
and
if
he
says
he
ll
take
me
in
i
think
i
ll
go
right
away
right
away
if
father
agrees
and
i
think
he
will
he
ll
be
only
too
glad
to
have
me
take
the
chance
of
making
a
man
out
of
myself
instead
of
a
bloodless
bookworm
murray
turned
over
with
a
short
laugh
and
propping
his
chin
on
his
elbows
lay
looking
at
jane
how
long
shall
you
stay
long
enough
to
do
the
business
a
year
if
necessary
when
i
come
back
i
ll
probably
be
wearing
leather
leggings
with
fringes
a
handkerchief
round
my
neck
and
a
sombrero
i
ve
no
doubt
the
cowboys
will
have
played
tricks
enough
on
me
to
prove
satisfactorily
to
all
concerned
whether
i
m
a
man
or
a
mushroom
jane
looked
steadily
down
at
the
face
below
her
and
realised
that
it
was
a
face
of
strength
as
well
as
of
fineness
the
eyes
which
met
hers
were
enlivened
by
a
determination
she
had
never
seen
in
them
before
and
her
answer
brought
into
them
a
light
which
surprised
and
pleased
her
i
think
it
s
the
best
plan
in
the
world
she
said
heartily
and
i
know
it
will
succeed
nobody
ever
set
himself
to
accomplishing
anything
without
accomplishing
either
that
thing
or
something
better
what
could
the
something
better
be
in
my
case
i
don
t
know
do
you
the
question
was
a
challenge
murray
sat
up
a
tinge
of
red
crept
into
his
cheek
yes
i
know
he
answered
so
do
you
i
think
you
put
it
into
my
head
am
i
a
coward
that
i
can
t
decide
to
give
myself
over
to
my
father
and
the
business
no
but
you
are
planning
to
put
your
shoulder
to
his
wheel
somehow
i
know
you
are
or
you
would
n
t
be
trying
so
hard
to
strengthen
that
shoulder
you
re
a
wizard
or
a
witch
murray
spoke
soberly
then
he
laughed
as
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
and
he
caught
the
fire
in
jane
s
are
you
always
so
sure
of
your
friends
always
if
i
have
a
friend
i
believe
in
her
whether
she
wants
me
to
or
not
she
always
proves
me
right
suppose
it
him
i
don
t
know
so
much
about
the
hims
said
jane
except
my
brothers
the
rule
works
with
them
you
must
be
an
inspiring
sister
you
ve
brothers
enough
already
i
suppose
but
i
wish
you
d
adopt
another
my
sister
she
can
t
be
far
from
your
age
but
she
seems
years
younger
she
has
n
t
thought
about
things
the
way
you
have
look
here
if
i
go
to
montana
for
a
year
i
shall
be
pretty
lonesome
sometimes
i
expect
will
you
let
me
write
to
you
it
would
be
great
fun
answered
jane
simply
to
have
letters
from
a
real
cowboy
with
in
his
belt
i
ll
take
them
out
when
i
write
to
you
must
we
go
back
well
if
you
think
we
ought
though
i
d
like
to
lie
here
all
day
and
dream
dreams
about
the
great
things
i
m
going
to
do
but
a
fellow
can
t
dream
much
in
the
society
of
the
bells
he
has
to
be
up
and
doing
with
a
heart
for
any
fate
quoted
jane
blithely
as
she
led
the
way
i
ll
tell
you
a
better
motto
than
that
though
fine
as
it
is
what
is
it
give
it
to
me
will
you
i
ll
write
it
out
for
you
when
perhaps
please
i
m
an
impatient
chap
very
well
you
shall
have
it
when
we
get
home
it
s
one
i
can
t
talk
about
somehow
it
gives
me
a
choke
in
my
throat
i
don
t
know
why
hours
later
murray
found
out
why
by
the
time
he
and
jane
had
rejoined
the
rest
of
the
party
the
threatening
had
brought
the
promised
rain
the
lunch
had
to
be
eaten
in
grandmother
bell
s
pleasant
kitchen
but
the
guests
enjoyed
it
almost
as
much
as
they
could
have
done
in
the
sylvan
spot
that
peter
had
picked
out
by
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
storm
had
passed
it
had
cooled
the
air
a
little
so
that
it
was
possible
for
the
party
to
spend
three
long
and
delightful
hours
upon
the
river
before
going
home
we
three
in
what
was
once
white
said
murray
as
he
stood
by
the
trap
are
a
pretty
crowd
to
go
back
all
together
why
may
i
not
change
places
with
peter
and
drive
the
bell
family
home
ross
chuckled
as
he
winked
at
jane
and
she
recalled
his
prophecy
of
some
days
earlier
but
it
was
he
and
nancy
who
took
the
back
seat
of
the
trap
leaving
rufus
and
shirley
in
the
surrey
to
carry
on
an
acquaintance
which
had
developed
to
great
friendliness
in
the
townsend
where
the
children
had
played
every
evening
throughout
the
summer
up
in
his
own
room
murray
took
from
his
pocket
a
slip
of
paper
jane
had
given
him
as
she
said
good
night
and
unfolding
it
as
if
it
were
a
message
from
a
royal
hand
he
read
it
slowly
through
the
expectation
of
this
message
had
been
warm
all
through
the
pleasant
drive
home
in
the
twilight
the
words
of
jane
s
quotation
were
these
and
as
it
happened
that
he
had
never
seen
them
before
they
came
to
him
at
this
crisis
of
his
life
with
peculiar
force
life
is
an
arrow
therefore
you
must
know
what
mark
to
aim
at
how
to
use
the
bow
then
draw
it
to
the
head
and
let
it
go
there
was
a
little
constriction
in
murray
s
own
throat
as
he
studied
the
brave
words
he
saw
at
a
flash
their
deeper
meaning
make
myself
fit
to
live
my
life
he
thought
and
then
whether
it
s
the
life
i
want
to
live
or
not
let
it
go
jane
you
know
how
to
fit
the
arrow
to
my
hand
bless
you
i
will
it
to
the
head
let
it
chapter
ix
snap
shots
a
letter
from
montana
for
miss
jane
bell
observed
peter
distributing
the
mail
at
the
one
may
morning
nine
months
after
the
picnic
at
grandfather
bell
s
farm
it
strikes
me
these
montana
letters
are
beginning
to
arrive
with
astonishing
regularity
they
began
declared
ross
enjoying
the
sight
of
the
sudden
colour
in
jane
s
face
as
she
tucked
the
letter
into
her
belt
and
tried
vainly
to
look
unconscious
as
she
went
on
serving
the
family
from
a
big
dish
of
oatmeal
porridge
by
coming
modestly
once
in
about
three
or
four
weeks
then
they
got
to
once
a
fortnight
that
was
in
midwinter
along
about
april
if
i
were
a
big
grown
man
murmured
jane
i
d
never
condescend
to
keep
track
of
along
in
april
pursued
ross
unmoved
once
in
ten
days
was
the
schedule
but
this
last
coming
as
it
does
just
one
short
week
after
its
predecessor
and
carrying
as
it
does
two
large
red
which
i
am
confident
is
underpayment
stop
teasing
cried
nancy
always
loyal
to
her
sister
every
one
of
you
is
envying
jane
wishing
you
could
have
letters
from
a
real
cowboy
a
real
cowboy
laughed
ross
i
think
i
see
murray
townsend
getting
himself
up
in
that
rig
with
his
pale
face
and
thin
shoulders
he
d
look
like
the
tenderest
kind
of
a
tenderfoot
jane
pulled
the
letter
out
of
her
belt
the
previous
letter
had
promised
that
this
one
should
bring
some
pictures
of
the
writer
and
his
surroundings
she
hoped
as
she
broke
the
seal
that
she
should
find
them
feeling
sure
that
the
extra
thick
letter
indicated
that
it
carried
the
promised
enclosures
as
she
pulled
out
the
sheets
a
little
packet
of
dropped
into
her
lap
she
picked
them
up
and
fell
to
looking
at
them
peter
sitting
next
to
her
laughed
to
himself
as
he
reached
for
his
dish
of
oatmeal
jane
having
forgotten
to
serve
him
but
everybody
forgot
breakfast
as
the
went
round
the
table
all
but
one
were
scenes
of
ranch
and
camp
life
bringing
into
view
horses
and
cowboys
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
each
carefully
labelled
with
its
descriptive
title
but
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
pack
was
called
the
tenderfoot
the
only
one
of
the
set
in
which
jane
s
correspondent
was
in
evidence
can
it
be
possible
this
is
murray
exclaimed
bell
studying
incredulously
the
erect
figure
on
horseback
life
and
energy
in
every
outline
from
the
tilt
of
the
wide
hat
to
the
set
of
the
leg
in
the
saddle
why
he
looks
as
if
he
weighed
thirty
pounds
more
than
when
he
went
away
by
george
the
fellow
has
n
t
roughed
it
nearly
a
year
for
nothing
has
he
admitted
ross
he
doesn
t
look
the
stage
cowboy
either
i
ll
say
that
for
him
those
clothes
have
seen
wear
and
rain
and
that
hat
has
had
the
true
western
shape
knocked
into
it
it
makes
you
envy
him
does
n
t
it
peter
said
nothing
but
his
eyes
dwelt
upon
the
figure
in
the
saddle
with
a
look
of
longing
so
intense
that
if
anyone
had
been
observing
him
it
must
have
told
his
story
plainly
one
person
was
observing
him
and
as
peter
looked
up
at
last
with
an
involuntary
glance
at
his
father
who
had
just
made
some
observation
on
the
advantage
it
had
been
to
the
rich
man
s
son
to
get
out
among
the
ranchmen
and
gain
a
new
view
of
life
he
met
his
father
s
eyes
joseph
bell
understood
just
what
it
meant
to
peter
to
stay
at
home
and
work
as
foreman
in
a
factory
when
there
were
such
places
as
montana
in
the
world
waiting
for
young
men
to
come
and
explore
them
and
there
was
that
in
his
father
s
look
which
told
peter
that
his
sacrifice
was
appreciated
up
in
her
own
room
when
a
dozen
duties
had
been
done
jane
read
her
letter
it
was
to
her
a
deeply
interesting
letter
as
had
been
all
those
which
came
before
it
for
murray
wielded
a
graphic
pen
and
his
pictures
of
the
sort
of
life
he
had
been
living
were
vivid
as
he
was
rejoicing
in
the
coming
of
spring
and
summer
after
the
long
cold
winter
and
his
delight
seemed
to
jane
so
unlike
any
pleasure
in
outdoor
life
she
had
seen
him
show
at
home
that
it
filled
her
with
joy
the
letter
said
as
it
neared
the
close
and
fell
into
the
personal
vein
as
letters
do
i
never
knew
before
what
it
was
to
breathe
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
my
lungs
my
existence
after
my
accident
and
up
to
the
time
i
came
here
seems
now
to
me
like
that
of
some
pale
monk
in
his
cell
feeding
on
other
men
s
thoughts
but
never
living
them
himself
i
ve
learned
to
live
you
who
have
long
known
that
secret
will
be
glad
with
me
won
t
you
all
through
the
winter
i
was
wrapped
to
the
eyes
whenever
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
cabin
door
men
dress
warmly
here
in
the
winter
canvas
overcoats
blanket
coats
they
call
them
felt
boots
and
all
that
but
they
don
t
make
grannies
of
themselves
as
i
did
at
first
as
the
winter
advanced
though
i
began
to
get
hardened
to
it
and
before
spring
i
could
stand
a
pretty
low
temperature
without
feeling
my
blood
congeal
but
when
spring
came
spring
in
this
western
country
i
wish
i
could
describe
it
the
air
like
wine
the
sunshine
like
nothing
i
can
think
of
when
spring
came
i
began
to
expand
mentally
and
physically
and
in
still
another
way
i
think
anyhow
i
m
not
the
same
fellow
who
went
to
the
doctor
for
an
outfit
of
drugs
before
he
dared
start
west
i
ve
learned
a
lot
from
these
men
i
ve
been
associated
with
a
rough
set
they
would
seem
to
you
most
of
them
they
did
to
me
at
first
but
when
i
got
to
know
them
underneath
the
roughness
i
found
men
it
s
no
use
trying
to
put
it
into
a
letter
i
must
talk
with
you
face
to
face
and
just
what
that
means
to
me
when
i
think
of
it
i
won
t
venture
to
say
i
ll
be
home
in
the
fall
and
then
i
m
going
into
my
father
s
business
i
have
n
t
said
that
before
have
i
you
ll
please
not
mention
it
to
anyone
except
peter
if
you
like
i
want
to
surprise
father
that
s
going
to
be
my
reward
for
doing
my
duty
it
is
my
duty
i
see
it
plainly
at
last
and
every
ounce
of
determination
i
can
grow
from
now
till
fall
is
going
to
be
just
so
much
more
to
offer
him
but
i
won
t
brag
about
that
do
the
best
i
can
it
won
t
be
a
wonderful
gift
for
i
m
afraid
my
talents
don
t
lie
in
that
direction
but
if
honest
effort
can
make
up
jane
i
have
n
t
watched
some
of
these
heroic
chaps
for
nothing
i
m
simply
shamed
into
taking
my
medicine
and
shutting
my
mouth
tight
after
it
and
that
s
the
last
word
about
it
s
being
medicine
i
m
going
to
get
interested
in
the
business
if
pitching
in
all
over
will
do
it
this
is
a
long
letter
and
i
m
done
except
to
tell
you
that
the
west
does
n
t
deserve
all
the
credit
for
my
altered
views
of
life
a
certain
girl
i
know
who
wanted
to
go
to
college
but
gave
up
all
thought
of
it
because
besides
the
family
her
father
and
brothers
had
half
a
dozen
helpless
elderly
relatives
to
support
isn
t
the
poorest
sort
of
inspiration
to
her
friend
when
he
happens
to
be
a
fellow
who
never
gave
up
anything
for
anybody
in
his
life
he
values
her
friendship
far
more
than
he
dares
to
tell
her
now
somebody
ruskin
said
a
knight
s
armour
never
fitted
him
quite
so
well
as
when
the
lady
s
hand
had
braced
it
and
i
m
beginning
to
understand
what
that
rather
picturesque
metaphor
may
mean
do
i
sound
sentimental
and
are
you
laughing
at
me
don
t
do
it
i
ve
not
a
gun
in
my
belt
but
i
m
rather
a
rough
looking
customer
nevertheless
i
came
in
an
hour
ago
wet
to
the
skin
caught
out
in
a
cloudburst
without
my
slicker
and
while
my
clothes
dry
am
attired
in
my
cousin
s
seven
sizes
too
big
being
averse
to
putting
on
any
of
the
clothes
in
my
trunk
the
foolish
clothes
of
civilisation
i
weigh
one
hundred
and
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
it
s
not
flesh
but
muscle
and
sinew
did
i
say
i
was
done
i
am
but
i
am
also
faithfully
your
friend
murray
townsend
you
look
it
agreed
jane
studying
the
photograph
you
certainly
look
it
she
gave
the
little
print
one
more
careful
examination
noting
the
steady
gaze
the
pictured
face
gave
back
a
spirited
expression
very
different
from
the
look
she
had
first
known
then
she
put
the
photographs
away
and
went
about
her
work
and
as
she
went
a
little
song
sang
itself
over
and
over
in
her
heart
the
song
of
trust
in
a
ripening
friendship
of
the
sort
that
makes
life
worth
living
spring
and
summer
passed
slowly
by
marking
a
growing
interchange
of
amenities
between
the
little
house
in
gay
street
and
the
big
one
in
worthington
square
things
had
happened
during
the
winter
things
kept
on
happening
as
the
year
advanced
to
draw
the
two
families
together
in
january
shirley
had
had
a
long
and
severe
illness
during
which
bell
and
jane
made
their
way
into
the
inmost
heart
of
every
member
of
the
household
there
were
nights
during
that
illness
when
joseph
bell
feeling
that
difference
of
social
position
counted
for
nothing
when
a
father
was
in
trouble
went
over
to
shake
harrison
townsend
s
hand
bidding
him
be
of
courage
and
found
himself
detained
as
a
friend
in
need
by
and
by
when
the
anxiety
was
over
and
the
bells
ceased
coming
often
in
and
out
the
townsends
began
to
summon
them
townsend
discovered
the
shrewd
wisdom
and
genial
philosophy
of
joseph
bell
to
be
of
value
and
often
went
to
sit
with
him
in
the
little
front
room
where
his
eyes
noted
with
approval
the
rows
of
books
he
discovered
that
armstrongs
s
head
man
knew
more
that
lay
between
the
covers
of
those
books
than
did
harrison
townsend
himself
as
for
townsend
and
bell
while
they
were
too
different
in
temperament
and
taste
to
get
far
into
each
other
s
lives
they
found
enough
in
common
to
bring
them
together
rather
oftener
than
could
naturally
have
been
expected
there
was
a
quiet
poise
about
bell
which
the
other
woman
accomplished
woman
of
the
world
though
she
was
could
only
study
in
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
attain
but
she
found
a
rest
and
refreshment
in
her
neighbour
s
society
which
none
of
her
more
fashionable
friends
could
give
her
and
she
sent
often
for
bell
to
keep
her
company
olive
s
taken
one
big
step
in
advance
peter
said
to
his
mother
one
day
in
early
summer
she
has
begun
to
write
regularly
to
forrest
i
m
very
glad
said
bell
does
he
answer
her
letters
he
does
only
too
glad
to
i
should
say
she
s
shown
me
some
of
his
letters
there
s
a
homesick
grunt
to
them
that
s
sure
life
in
the
army
and
particularly
life
in
the
philippines
is
n
t
unmitigated
bliss
and
he
s
finding
it
out
he
does
n
t
exactly
squeal
but
you
can
see
how
it
is
with
him
it
will
do
olive
good
to
take
up
such
a
sisterly
duty
was
it
your
suggestion
asked
bell
how
did
you
guess
that
i
did
give
her
a
talk
one
day
when
she
happened
to
say
that
shirley
was
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
wrote
to
forrest
with
any
regularity
she
was
pretty
angry
with
me
for
a
day
or
two
but
she
came
round
and
now
she
writes
once
a
fortnight
there
s
really
more
to
that
girl
than
you
would
think
she
is
improving
very
much
i
am
sure
agreed
his
mother
warmly
with
a
different
early
training
olive
would
have
been
by
now
a
much
more
lovable
girl
than
she
has
seemed
but
happily
it
s
not
too
late
to
give
her
new
ideals
and
i
think
you
have
helped
in
that
direction
ideals
mused
peter
i
don
t
think
i
have
any
of
those
at
least
i
don
t
call
them
by
that
name
rules
of
the
game
how
will
that
do
instead
the
foreman
of
room
in
a
factory
is
n
t
supposed
to
have
ideals
is
he
i
don
t
know
about
that
suppose
you
ask
the
men
and
women
under
you
i
fancy
they
would
protest
your
ideals
were
pretty
hard
for
them
to
live
up
to
peter
laughed
to
himself
maybe
they
would
but
they
would
n
t
put
it
that
way
the
boss
is
a
tough
one
to
suit
they
d
say
call
it
what
you
will
rules
of
the
game
if
you
like
but
as
the
children
used
to
say
peter
bell
plays
fair
i
hope
he
does
if
he
does
n
t
it
is
n
t
the
fault
of
his
trainer
and
the
gray
eyes
met
the
brown
ones
for
an
instant
in
a
glance
which
said
many
things
peter
could
not
have
spoken
the
days
went
on
june
gave
place
to
july
august
heat
melted
into
september
mildness
and
october
with
its
falling
leaves
marked
the
end
of
the
days
of
outdoor
life
lived
from
april
to
november
in
the
little
garden
the
is
jane
s
birthday
observed
nancy
to
shirley
several
days
before
that
event
we
re
wondering
what
to
do
in
celebration
why
it
s
mine
too
cried
shirley
how
funny
that
we
did
n
t
know
it
we
ought
to
celebrate
it
together
this
remark
was
duly
reported
to
bell
who
said
at
once
that
they
must
invite
shirley
over
to
have
her
birthday
cake
with
jane
s
but
before
this
plan
could
be
carried
into
effect
an
invitation
arrived
from
the
big
house
asking
every
member
of
the
bell
household
to
be
present
at
a
small
dinner
of
shirley
s
own
planning
this
is
the
first
time
we
ve
all
been
asked
over
there
together
it
s
quite
an
occasion
declared
peter
on
the
evening
of
the
as
he
stood
waiting
in
the
doorway
for
everybody
to
be
ready
i
say
he
exclaimed
but
we
re
gorgeous
and
he
fastened
admiring
eyes
on
his
mother
who
was
dressed
in
a
pale
gray
gown
of
her
own
making
and
therefore
of
faultless
effect
the
quality
was
fine
also
for
peter
had
looked
after
that
gorgeous
does
n
t
seem
exactly
the
word
ross
commented
demure
but
coquettish
i
should
call
that
gown
the
party
proceeded
in
a
body
to
the
corner
of
worthington
square
where
jane
under
escort
of
peter
came
to
a
sudden
halt
oh
i
ve
forgotten
something
to
go
with
my
present
to
shirley
she
said
to
him
give
me
the
key
please
i
ll
run
back
and
get
it
don
t
wait
i
want
to
slip
into
the
over
there
anyway
before
i
see
anybody
and
i
ll
come
in
by
the
side
door
so
jane
ran
back
alone
and
let
herself
into
the
dark
house
the
lamps
having
for
safety
been
all
extinguished
before
the
family
went
out
she
hurriedly
lighted
the
lamp
in
the
front
room
for
she
meant
to
fill
out
a
card
with
a
certain
appropriate
quotation
to
put
with
shirley
s
gift
and
the
book
she
needed
was
in
this
room
the
quotation
was
not
as
easily
found
as
she
had
thought
it
would
be
and
hurriedly
searching
for
it
jane
consumed
considerable
time
but
did
not
want
to
give
it
up
for
the
words
fitted
shirley
delightfully
and
would
give
point
to
the
gift
so
bending
over
the
book
still
unsuccessful
she
heard
with
regret
the
sound
of
a
quick
step
upon
the
porch
followed
by
a
ring
at
the
bell
she
sprang
up
book
in
hand
wishing
she
had
taken
her
affairs
with
her
light
into
the
hoping
that
her
appearance
in
her
evening
frock
would
warn
the
chance
visitor
that
the
time
was
inopportune
she
opened
the
door
jane
exclaimed
a
joyful
voice
ah
but
this
is
good
luck
and
jane
looked
up
into
a
face
so
brown
and
rugged
and
strong
that
for
an
instant
she
did
not
know
it
but
the
eyes
gazing
eagerly
into
her
own
told
her
in
the
next
breath
who
stood
before
her
she
put
out
both
hands
speechless
with
surprise
they
were
grasped
and
held
as
murray
townsend
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
a
sturdy
shoulder
i
you
why
i
thought
you
were
n
t
coming
for
a
month
yet
she
said
half
shyly
for
in
spite
of
the
smile
and
the
warm
handclasp
it
seemed
as
if
this
must
be
a
stranger
who
stood
before
her
radiating
health
and
happiness
and
looking
so
different
from
the
pale
young
man
who
had
gone
away
a
year
before
i
was
hit
by
a
sudden
wave
of
homesickness
that
swept
me
off
my
feet
murray
explained
releasing
the
hands
which
were
gently
drawing
themselves
away
but
continuing
to
stare
down
at
the
engaging
young
figure
in
its
modest
evening
attire
as
if
he
had
seen
nothing
so
attractive
in
all
montana
in
spite
of
his
fine
tales
of
its
glories
i
began
to
think
about
it
and
that
was
fatal
once
the
notion
of
coming
home
a
bit
ahead
of
the
date
i
d
set
took
hold
of
me
i
was
no
more
use
to
anybody
they
told
me
to
pack
up
and
start
for
i
was
n
t
fit
to
brand
a
calf
and
could
n
t
earn
my
salt
he
laughed
tell
me
you
re
not
sorry
indeed
i
m
not
this
happens
to
be
my
birthday
and
it
s
the
nicest
surprise
i
ve
had
yet
thank
you
that
s
the
welcome
i
wanted
but
he
glanced
at
her
dress
again
and
his
face
fell
you
were
going
out
only
to
worthington
square
laughed
jane
it
s
shirley
s
birthday
too
and
we
re
all
to
be
there
at
dinner
why
you
must
know
you
ve
just
come
from
there
that
is
a
joke
on
me
i
rang
no
you
know
and
a
new
maid
i
ve
never
seen
let
me
in
i
saw
everything
lighted
up
and
flowers
all
about
and
asked
if
they
were
entertaining
she
said
they
were
and
everybody
was
dressing
so
i
just
turned
and
ran
thinking
i
d
slip
over
here
and
see
you
first
since
i
could
n
t
see
much
of
my
family
till
the
affair
was
over
well
well
so
i
may
spend
the
evening
in
your
company
talk
about
luck
they
stood
there
exchanging
questions
and
replies
in
the
laughing
disconnected
way
in
which
people
are
wont
to
address
each
other
in
the
first
excitement
of
an
unexpected
and
welcome
meeting
neither
of
them
knowing
quite
what
they
were
saying
but
each
feeling
that
something
of
great
importance
had
happened
then
jane
gathered
up
her
wraps
and
shirley
s
gift
and
said
with
a
startled
glance
at
the
clock
it
is
later
than
i
thought
we
must
go
this
minute
shall
i
put
out
the
light
and
murray
strode
across
the
floor
jane
noted
with
gladness
that
his
walk
was
the
walk
of
a
strong
man
they
crossed
the
street
to
the
hedge
gate
and
came
to
the
side
entrance
as
he
put
his
thumb
to
the
bell
murray
said
half
under
his
breath
i
ve
imagined
all
sorts
of
but
never
one
quite
so
nice
as
this
to
make
my
entrance
with
you
oh
you
re
not
going
to
make
it
with
me
said
jane
gaily
i
shall
stay
in
the
arranging
shirley
s
plate
until
you
are
safe
in
the
midst
of
them
and
plead
as
he
would
murray
found
there
was
no
way
to
make
her
change
this
decision
so
at
last
hearing
the
voices
of
the
others
in
the
big
hall
where
they
were
gathered
about
the
fireplace
in
which
roared
a
royal
october
fire
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
crack
from
this
position
he
looked
back
at
jane
where
she
stood
by
shirley
s
chair
watching
him
across
the
gala
decorations
of
roses
which
crowned
the
handsome
table
i
m
at
home
again
he
called
to
her
softly
and
she
nodded
smiling
then
hat
in
hand
he
threw
the
door
wide
and
marched
through
shoulders
back
head
up
eyes
intent
upon
the
faces
which
at
the
opening
of
the
door
had
turned
that
way
chapter
x
hide
and
seek
there
was
a
moment
s
astonished
hush
as
the
group
about
the
fire
stared
at
the
erect
young
figure
then
murray
s
father
was
the
first
across
the
floor
to
meet
him
and
in
an
instant
more
the
whole
family
was
upon
him
while
the
bells
rose
smiling
to
do
him
honour
my
dear
boy
there
was
a
great
gladness
in
harrison
townsend
s
voice
and
he
wrung
his
son
s
hand
as
if
he
would
wring
it
off
murray
s
mother
too
he
had
not
known
she
was
capable
of
so
much
tenderness
and
he
kissed
her
with
a
feeling
that
in
his
thoughts
he
had
n
t
done
her
love
for
him
justice
as
for
olive
and
shirley
there
was
nothing
lacking
in
the
way
they
showed
their
joy
in
having
him
at
home
again
murray
himself
during
this
long
year
of
absence
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
learned
a
few
enlightening
truths
about
the
great
business
of
living
to
the
full
also
murray
enjoyed
the
surprising
fact
that
the
bells
were
grouped
about
the
fire
in
a
way
which
indicated
that
they
were
entirely
at
home
he
rejoiced
in
the
heartiness
with
which
the
male
members
of
that
family
gripped
his
hand
they
seemed
like
brothers
and
when
the
lady
in
gray
pressed
his
hand
in
both
her
own
and
looked
at
him
as
if
her
pleasure
in
his
return
was
very
great
murray
quite
unable
to
help
it
stooped
and
kissed
her
also
surely
homecoming
was
a
happier
thing
than
he
had
dared
to
picture
it
he
was
off
upstairs
to
his
room
presently
while
word
was
sent
to
an
exasperated
cook
to
delay
the
dinner
yet
a
little
longer
in
less
time
than
could
have
been
expected
however
murray
was
down
again
and
in
his
evening
clothes
showed
even
more
plainly
than
before
the
astonishing
increase
in
his
weight
these
shoulders
cried
peter
inspecting
them
can
they
be
the
shoulders
of
the
delicate
young
gentleman
who
went
away
last
year
looking
so
long
and
lean
and
lank
i
wonder
you
could
get
them
into
your
coat
i
could
n
t
murray
answered
laughing
i
had
to
borrow
father
s
and
one
of
his
waistcoats
it
was
fortunate
for
you
that
the
old
coat
was
n
t
given
away
when
the
new
one
came
home
his
father
observed
regarding
the
shoulders
in
evidence
with
great
satisfaction
they
went
out
to
dinner
in
the
gayest
spirits
and
if
everybody
remembered
with
regret
the
one
absent
everybody
still
rejoiced
that
this
promising
son
of
the
house
was
once
more
at
its
board
for
there
could
be
no
question
that
the
eldest
son
looked
now
a
fit
representative
of
the
family
of
townsend
the
dinner
which
followed
was
an
elaborate
one
for
it
was
not
within
the
range
of
the
hostess
s
notions
to
entertain
in
any
simple
fashion
even
when
the
occasion
was
the
birthday
of
a
but
the
young
people
at
the
board
succeeded
in
infusing
so
much
of
their
own
joyousness
into
the
affair
that
the
time
passed
swiftly
there
were
birthday
gifts
at
jane
s
plate
as
well
as
at
shirley
s
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
at
the
close
of
the
feast
which
pair
of
cheeks
was
the
pinker
or
which
pair
of
eyes
the
brighter
it
is
safe
to
guess
however
that
there
were
elements
in
the
pleasure
of
one
recipient
which
must
have
been
lacking
in
that
of
the
other
and
that
the
presence
of
one
birthday
guest
counted
for
more
to
her
than
all
the
gifts
put
together
the
fact
that
she
could
hardly
look
up
without
encountering
the
interested
glance
of
the
newly
arrived
traveller
was
just
a
trifle
disconcerting
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
when
jane
and
shirley
gathered
up
their
gifts
at
the
close
of
the
dinner
the
little
girl
knew
better
than
the
older
one
just
what
she
had
received
dinner
over
a
short
and
not
especially
dramatic
little
scene
took
place
behind
closed
library
doors
scenes
which
mean
the
most
are
often
quietest
of
all
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
sir
said
murray
to
his
father
something
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
right
away
i
went
west
to
make
myself
strong
enough
to
to
go
into
the
business
if
you
care
to
have
me
i
mean
he
went
on
quickly
as
his
father
looked
at
him
as
if
he
could
not
quite
believe
the
purport
of
these
words
i
mean
in
whatever
capacity
you
can
use
me
if
you
think
i
d
better
begin
at
the
bottom
and
his
smile
was
not
a
smile
which
supplied
but
of
course
you
won
t
townsend
stood
looking
at
murray
studying
the
straightforward
gaze
which
met
his
noting
the
tints
of
health
the
signs
of
vigour
in
the
fine
face
murray
do
you
mean
it
he
asked
i
do
sir
and
yet
you
don
t
like
the
prospect
of
a
business
life
any
more
than
you
ever
did
do
you
not
much
sir
you
make
this
offer
knowing
fully
what
it
entails
i
have
little
expectation
that
your
brother
will
ever
agree
to
my
wishes
that
s
what
decided
me
you
are
willing
to
give
up
your
books
you
could
complete
your
college
course
now
with
your
renewed
health
if
murray
winced
at
this
he
did
not
let
it
show
i
think
you
need
me
now
sir
and
as
for
the
college
course
and
the
books
i
shall
have
my
evenings
townsend
studied
his
son
s
face
a
full
minute
in
silence
then
he
held
out
his
hand
murray
seized
it
with
a
grasp
which
banished
the
elder
man
s
doubts
and
showed
him
that
his
boy
s
heart
was
in
this
offer
of
himself
the
two
shook
hands
without
speaking
there
seemed
no
need
of
further
words
just
then
it
being
shirley
s
birthday
that
young
person
s
wishes
ruled
the
hour
prompted
by
rufus
who
thirsted
for
something
lively
she
decreed
a
game
of
over
the
whole
house
and
succeeded
in
enticing
the
elder
people
into
the
frolic
townsend
and
murray
coming
from
the
library
found
things
in
full
swing
bell
was
just
emerging
from
a
small
closet
under
the
staircase
his
hair
much
rumpled
bell
laughing
blithely
had
run
round
a
corner
of
the
and
touched
goal
before
her
son
rufus
could
swing
himself
down
the
stairs
and
get
in
ahead
of
her
townsend
and
her
husband
could
not
quite
credit
his
eyes
as
he
saw
her
was
with
trailing
skirts
held
close
squeezing
out
of
a
very
small
corner
behind
the
grand
piano
in
the
well
well
cried
the
newcomers
enthusiastically
let
us
into
the
game
come
on
shouted
rufus
father
s
it
let
s
play
it
in
another
way
and
hide
for
keeps
everybody
stay
hid
till
found
and
each
man
found
join
the
hunt
makes
it
nice
and
exciting
for
the
last
fellow
you
ll
have
to
tell
us
our
bounds
pretty
carefully
said
bell
smiling
at
his
hostess
in
our
excitement
we
may
open
the
wrong
doors
open
any
door
responded
townsend
promptly
feeling
more
like
a
girl
again
than
she
had
felt
in
many
years
of
formal
entertaining
and
preparing
as
she
spoke
to
hurry
up
the
staircase
to
a
retreat
that
she
felt
would
be
secure
it
proved
great
fun
and
a
full
went
by
before
the
last
one
was
found
murray
had
been
the
first
to
be
discovered
his
head
so
full
of
the
late
talk
in
the
library
that
he
had
somewhat
dazedly
secreted
himself
in
a
position
easily
come
upon
by
bell
so
when
the
second
round
began
it
was
murray
who
stood
counting
the
tale
of
numbers
in
the
hall
below
while
his
quarry
scurried
away
over
the
house
he
knows
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
of
course
whispered
ross
to
jane
as
they
ran
lightly
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
so
we
ll
have
to
hide
pretty
close
to
escape
him
i
m
for
a
closet
i
know
of
where
there
s
a
pile
of
blankets
as
big
as
a
barn
will
you
come
no
i
know
a
better
place
and
jane
slipped
away
by
herself
she
meant
to
be
the
last
found
and
to
elude
murray
as
long
as
she
could
a
very
girlish
feeling
having
taken
possession
of
her
that
the
time
to
run
away
is
the
time
when
you
see
somebody
looking
uncommonly
as
if
he
would
like
to
be
with
you
although
she
longed
to
hear
the
outcome
of
the
conference
in
the
library
she
was
somehow
just
a
little
afraid
of
the
new
murray
and
it
was
with
a
delightful
sense
of
exhilaration
that
she
made
her
quick
and
quiet
way
up
a
third
flight
of
stairs
to
one
of
shirley
s
haunts
in
an
unused
portion
of
the
regions
under
the
eaves
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
heard
the
sounds
of
the
hunt
in
which
at
last
the
whole
party
had
come
to
join
approaching
her
hiding
place
but
suddenly
a
lower
door
was
thrown
open
and
murray
s
voice
sounded
far
down
in
a
determined
challenge
we
ll
have
you
now
jane
it
s
no
use
shirley
s
kept
us
away
so
far
the
rascal
but
your
time
s
up
she
be
caught
there
was
a
tiny
door
low
down
in
the
side
of
the
closet
where
she
was
hiding
and
dark
though
she
knew
it
must
be
in
the
unknown
region
beyond
this
door
she
opened
it
slipped
through
closed
it
and
crept
along
the
bare
beams
beyond
murray
was
carrying
a
little
electric
searchlight
which
he
was
flashing
into
every
nook
and
crevice
its
sharp
beam
had
penetrated
the
hole
in
the
blankets
ross
had
kept
for
a
breathing
space
it
had
likewise
sought
out
the
hems
of
skirts
the
soles
of
shoes
fingers
clutching
concealing
draperies
and
elbows
sticking
unwarily
out
from
sly
nooks
jane
saw
its
rays
outline
the
edges
of
the
small
door
beyond
which
she
crouched
then
she
heard
murray
s
triumphant
cry
she
s
dropped
her
handkerchief
now
we
re
hot
on
the
trail
she
s
gone
through
this
door
the
crafty
lady
there
was
a
shout
of
mingled
laughter
and
expostulation
she
wouldn
t
go
through
that
it
s
too
dark
in
there
for
a
girl
there
s
no
floor
either
but
murray
was
attempting
to
open
the
door
it
was
a
sliding
door
not
a
hinged
one
and
for
a
moment
it
delayed
him
for
he
was
not
familiar
with
these
regions
so
dear
to
shirley
during
that
moment
jane
with
the
breathless
unreadiness
to
be
discovered
which
takes
hold
of
the
hiding
one
even
in
a
game
had
desperately
retreated
over
the
rafters
in
the
hope
of
coming
upon
some
sheltering
corner
the
next
instant
with
a
smothered
cry
she
had
fallen
over
the
edge
of
something
into
three
feet
of
water
nobody
had
heard
her
and
somehow
in
the
intensity
of
the
game
jane
s
second
emotion
after
the
startling
sensation
of
her
sudden
immersion
was
one
of
absurd
relief
at
finding
herself
after
all
safe
from
discovery
for
as
the
little
door
at
last
flew
open
and
murray
s
brilliant
light
leaped
into
the
space
under
the
eaves
it
disclosed
to
jane
that
she
had
dropped
into
a
cistern
the
top
of
which
lay
level
with
the
floor
beams
and
at
the
bottom
thereof
where
having
scrambled
to
her
feet
she
stood
stooping
was
out
of
sight
of
the
faces
peering
in
at
the
small
door
not
here
was
murray
s
disappointed
observation
after
one
wave
of
his
light
round
the
small
space
unless
she
s
in
mother
s
special
tank
white
frock
and
all
come
on
i
thought
we
had
her
then
sure
where
can
she
be
she
s
been
here
witness
that
handkerchief
and
if
there
s
a
cranny
we
have
n
t
explored
i
ll
the
little
door
closed
with
a
slam
the
light
faded
away
from
its
edges
the
voices
of
the
party
were
heard
retreating
down
the
stairs
and
jane
was
left
alone
to
realise
the
humour
of
the
situation
it
was
undoubtedly
humorous
it
could
hardly
be
dangerous
for
october
had
been
a
mild
month
and
jane
was
well
used
to
cold
plunges
the
wetting
of
the
pretty
frock
was
of
no
consequence
for
it
was
quite
washable
it
was
fairly
easy
to
scramble
back
to
the
rafters
jane
had
done
that
the
moment
the
searching
party
was
out
of
hearing
and
was
carefully
wringing
out
her
drenched
skirts
her
impromptu
bath
had
wet
her
to
the
shoulders
besides
bruising
her
arm
rather
badly
but
the
trying
thing
was
to
get
downstairs
and
away
without
being
discovered
and
the
whole
company
in
full
cry
over
the
house
jane
laughed
rather
hysterically
shivering
a
little
more
from
excitement
and
chagrin
than
from
chill
she
crept
carefully
to
the
small
door
meaning
to
push
it
open
and
listen
when
suddenly
it
began
to
slide
quietly
aside
of
itself
the
next
instant
she
saw
a
sunburned
hand
upon
its
fastening
and
heard
a
cool
voice
close
by
say
quietly
it
s
all
right
nobody
knows
but
me
they
ve
given
it
up
and
sat
down
to
await
your
own
sweet
will
in
showing
up
here
s
a
big
steamer
rug
will
you
have
it
to
wrap
up
in
i
ll
get
you
home
without
a
soul
knowing
and
we
ll
play
it
off
as
a
joke
somehow
thank
you
answered
jane
in
a
very
meek
voice
which
shook
with
mingled
irritation
and
merriment
as
the
rug
came
through
the
opening
perhaps
i
could
put
it
on
better
if
i
were
not
balancing
myself
on
these
rafters
i
beg
your
pardon
i
ll
get
out
of
this
closet
and
you
can
get
in
i
just
thought
you
would
n
t
leave
so
so
damp
a
trail
behind
you
if
you
were
wrapped
up
in
something
here
are
a
er
a
pair
of
olive
s
rubbers
for
your
feet
so
you
won
t
show
any
tracks
murray
s
voice
was
shaking
also
and
in
a
minute
more
the
two
were
laughing
together
jane
shrouded
in
her
rug
emerged
from
the
closet
into
the
attic
and
murray
regarded
her
by
the
light
of
his
electric
searcher
you
don
t
look
much
the
worse
for
having
taken
such
desperate
measures
to
escape
me
he
remarked
noting
with
keen
enjoyment
the
rich
colour
on
the
cheek
near
which
he
was
rather
mercilessly
holding
his
torch
rather
meet
a
cold
ducking
than
a
warm
friend
any
time
wouldn
t
you
not
at
all
i
you
know
how
one
hates
to
be
caught
does
one
now
i
can
t
conceive
jumping
into
a
tank
of
water
to
escape
you
if
you
had
been
after
me
please
stop
laughing
at
me
and
help
me
to
get
home
i
m
not
laughing
at
you
i
m
i
may
pretend
to
be
laughing
but
inside
i
assure
you
i
m
tremendously
worried
lest
this
running
away
indicates
a
state
of
mind
please
take
me
home
come
then
he
led
the
way
by
back
staircases
to
a
quiet
side
entrance
and
so
quickly
across
the
street
and
into
her
own
house
then
he
went
back
to
the
others
to
evade
their
questioning
so
cleverly
that
nobody
but
jane
s
mother
suspected
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
had
happened
in
a
very
short
time
indeed
jane
drifted
inconspicuously
in
upon
the
company
again
and
when
inquiries
from
the
younger
members
of
the
party
as
to
the
change
in
her
costume
fell
thick
and
fast
upon
her
murray
protected
her
with
the
nonchalant
explanation
don
t
bother
her
she
s
very
kindly
trying
to
shield
me
for
being
the
cause
of
a
little
accident
that
happened
to
the
other
dress
it
was
confoundedly
awkward
of
me
but
she
cheers
me
by
declaring
that
she
can
easily
repair
damages
it
was
murray
who
took
jane
home
again
by
and
by
and
who
lingered
on
the
porch
after
the
others
had
gone
in
to
tell
her
how
his
father
had
received
the
good
news
i
m
so
glad
jane
s
hands
were
clasped
tight
together
i
knew
it
would
be
just
as
you
tell
me
are
n
t
you
wonderfully
happy
wonderfully
happier
than
ever
in
my
life
except
for
just
one
thing
nothing
serious
well
i
certainly
hope
not
what
bothers
me
is
that
you
seem
somehow
not
exactly
afraid
of
me
but
different
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
but
i
he
stopped
his
tone
growing
anxious
you
know
i
could
n
t
bear
that
he
added
unless
i
thought
it
meant
see
here
jane
are
we
just
as
good
friends
as
ever
why
of
course
we
are
she
said
it
shyly
she
was
very
glad
it
was
so
dark
on
the
little
porch
friends
for
always
i
don
t
change
i
think
she
answered
with
a
proud
little
lift
of
the
head
don
t
you
well
as
i
don
t
either
that
ought
to
satisfy
me
yet
it
does
n
t
quite
after
all
it
s
odd
but
i
believe
just
being
good
friends
who
don
t
change
is
n
t
enough
oh
don
t
go
you
re
not
angry
yes
i
know
it
s
late
but
i
ve
hardly
seen
you
yet
you
will
go
but
you
ll
let
me
come
over
early
after
more
than
a
year
away
well
then
i
ll
have
to
teach
you
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
on
my
honour
i
m
not
carrying
a
gun
wait
a
minute
just
a
minute
did
i
ever
stay
away
from
you
so
long
good
night
little
jane
good
night
chapter
xi
in
the
garden
winter
long
and
cold
spring
late
and
slow
then
all
at
once
in
june
radiant
summer
and
the
little
garden
round
the
corner
in
gay
street
was
a
place
of
richly
bursting
bloom
a
riot
of
colours
against
the
leafy
green
background
of
its
walls
toward
the
end
of
june
a
week
of
almost
tropical
heat
had
made
the
evenings
outdoors
on
the
little
porch
and
in
the
garden
itself
events
to
be
looked
forward
to
throughout
the
day
joseph
bell
peter
ross
and
rufus
thought
of
them
many
times
during
the
hottest
day
of
all
midsummer
the
of
the
month
and
came
home
at
night
to
find
the
table
laid
for
a
supper
out
under
the
shadow
of
the
maple
and
bell
jane
and
nancy
in
thin
summer
frocks
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
attractive
meal
about
to
be
served
there
up
in
a
window
of
the
house
next
door
behind
closed
blinds
an
elderly
neighbour
had
watched
jane
wreathing
a
big
glass
bowl
full
of
strawberries
with
a
crisp
little
green
vine
spray
the
bells
certainly
are
the
queerest
people
anybody
ever
lived
neighbour
to
she
said
over
her
shoulder
to
her
sister
a
withered
little
spinster
who
in
this
hot
small
upstairs
room
was
sewing
at
another
window
which
did
not
look
out
upon
the
garden
and
therefore
could
have
its
blinds
open
anybody
d
think
life
was
just
one
picnic
to
them
think
of
lugging
all
those
dishes
outdoors
this
hot
night
and
then
lugging
em
all
in
again
and
they
all
dressed
out
in
flowered
muslins
the
sister
came
to
the
window
and
peered
somewhat
wistfully
out
through
the
closed
blinds
it
does
look
sort
of
pleasant
out
there
she
said
and
we
certainly
can
t
say
they
re
not
good
neighbours
bell
sent
over
a
whole
tin
of
those
light
rolls
of
hers
this
morning
they
ll
come
in
handy
for
supper
there
come
the
men
hunter
brought
her
gaze
to
bear
upon
the
four
who
had
stolen
up
to
the
gate
and
who
as
she
spoke
burst
out
suddenly
with
a
crisp
clapping
of
hands
which
brought
the
three
in
the
to
the
if
hunter
and
miss
maria
watching
those
four
advance
could
have
heard
what
they
were
saying
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
table
they
might
have
had
a
new
light
shed
upon
the
question
whether
the
trouble
of
bringing
forth
all
those
dishes
from
the
house
had
been
worth
while
the
neighbours
saw
the
merry
little
meal
eaten
and
saw
all
hands
clear
it
away
at
the
end
making
short
work
of
the
many
dishes
but
afterward
twilight
fell
and
little
could
be
discerned
except
the
gleam
of
the
light
dresses
and
the
presence
near
of
dark
forms
lying
on
the
grass
it
was
after
the
midsummer
moon
was
lighting
the
garden
into
a
small
that
peter
springing
up
exclaimed
there
s
olive
and
murray
and
ran
to
greet
them
there
was
a
third
person
with
them
and
a
moment
later
the
others
heard
peter
exclaim
in
a
tone
of
surprise
well
well
well
you
don
t
mean
to
say
this
is
why
how
are
you
how
are
you
i
m
tremendously
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
i
m
a
good
deal
gladder
to
be
home
than
anybody
possibly
can
be
to
have
me
and
jane
recognising
first
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
voice
cried
out
why
it
s
forrest
and
led
the
others
as
a
general
uprising
took
place
yes
it
s
forrest
said
the
voice
and
in
the
bright
moonlight
jane
looked
up
into
the
face
whose
outlines
in
these
two
years
of
absence
had
grown
dim
in
her
memory
it
was
the
same
face
but
she
thought
it
looked
older
and
thinner
and
she
realised
then
and
there
that
forrest
was
not
the
same
careless
boy
who
had
gone
so
lightly
away
to
lead
a
soldier
s
life
when
the
greetings
were
over
and
the
company
had
settled
down
again
on
the
turf
under
the
maple
jane
found
forrest
next
to
herself
and
had
her
first
little
insight
into
his
thoughts
i
feel
like
a
stranger
from
a
foreign
country
i
assure
you
he
was
saying
to
her
presently
as
the
talk
and
laughter
of
the
others
made
a
bit
of
confidence
possible
and
the
strangest
thing
of
all
to
me
is
the
sight
of
my
brother
grinding
away
down
there
in
the
office
looking
like
the
healthiest
fellow
in
town
i
can
t
understand
it
it
took
me
off
my
feet
we
have
grown
so
used
to
the
change
said
jane
smiling
to
herself
in
the
dim
light
that
we
don
t
think
about
it
any
more
you
see
forrest
pursued
i
came
home
on
the
quiet
just
wanting
to
see
you
know
how
they
would
take
it
i
thought
if
they
really
still
cared
i
should
know
it
by
the
look
on
their
faces
oh
how
could
you
think
jane
began
eagerly
but
he
interrupted
a
fellow
thinks
a
good
many
things
when
he
s
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
i
well
i
got
to
wanting
to
know
some
things
so
badly
i
was
n
t
sorry
when
i
had
my
fever
yes
you
did
n
t
know
that
did
you
oh
i
had
it
all
right
and
i
wasn
t
sorry
when
they
sent
me
home
with
a
lot
of
other
convalescents
so
i
made
for
the
office
the
minute
i
had
seen
my
mother
and
the
girls
for
they
told
me
that
murray
was
down
there
for
good
a
thing
i
had
n
t
known
maybe
they
thought
i
d
be
jealous
and
maybe
i
was
in
a
way
though
i
don
t
want
the
job
any
more
than
i
ever
did
father
gave
me
a
good
warm
greeting
i
ll
say
that
and
murray
well
when
he
got
up
and
came
toward
me
with
his
hand
out
looking
like
the
strongest
kind
of
a
young
business
man
i
felt
as
if
but
i
can
t
tell
you
about
that
now
there
was
a
general
movement
of
the
younger
people
of
the
party
in
response
to
a
request
from
ross
who
was
entertaining
them
with
some
new
tricks
at
which
he
was
an
adept
during
the
confusion
murray
came
and
flung
himself
upon
the
grass
beside
jane
take
me
into
the
conference
will
you
he
said
i
m
envious
of
anybody
my
brother
talks
to
i
m
so
glad
to
get
him
back
under
cover
of
the
subdued
light
jane
found
her
hand
which
had
been
resting
on
the
cool
grass
where
she
sat
taken
into
a
warm
significant
grasp
as
familiar
now
as
it
was
dear
she
gave
back
a
little
answering
pressure
without
turning
her
head
toward
murray
at
whose
close
presence
she
had
grown
instantly
happier
take
you
in
forrest
answered
slowly
well
if
you
and
all
the
others
will
only
take
me
in
and
never
turn
me
out
or
let
me
turn
myself
out
again
i
ll
be
satisfied
with
one
hand
holding
tight
the
small
one
buried
in
the
grass
murray
s
other
hand
went
out
toward
the
fist
clenched
on
forrest
s
knee
old
fellow
he
said
warmly
if
you
ll
just
stay
where
you
can
get
over
often
into
this
garden
in
gay
street
you
ll
find
it
will
do
as
much
toward
making
life
worth
living
as
it
has
done
for
every
other
one
of
the
townsend
family
i
believe
you
answered
forrest
and
gave
the
brotherly
hand
an
answering
grip

jane
wears
pearls
a
tap
upon
her
door
sent
murray
townsend
flying
across
the
room
to
answer
it
she
expected
to
find
her
husband
there
awaiting
her
permission
to
come
in
and
see
her
in
the
white
gown
which
she
had
worn
but
once
before
two
months
ago
he
had
vowed
since
that
he
had
never
seen
that
being
occupied
wholly
upon
the
occasion
on
which
it
was
worn
in
keeping
his
head
in
order
to
play
his
own
part
with
dignity
and
but
to
jane
s
disappointment
she
opened
the
door
only
to
a
maid
with
a
florist
s
box
the
box
upon
being
examined
yielded
up
among
a
mass
of
roses
murray
s
card
which
bore
this
message
sorry
to
be
delayed
dear
but
father
wanted
to
go
over
everything
that
has
happened
at
the
office
during
my
absence
will
be
up
in
time
for
the
wear
one
of
these
for
murray
jane
smiled
regretfully
it
had
seemed
a
long
day
only
that
morning
she
and
murray
had
returned
belated
from
their
wedding
journey
across
the
continent
to
find
cards
out
for
a
reception
in
their
honour
to
take
place
that
very
evening
you
knew
the
date
harrison
townsend
had
said
to
her
elder
son
when
upon
being
told
that
his
delay
had
caused
much
anxiety
to
the
givers
of
the
affair
he
turned
to
his
bride
with
a
soft
whistle
of
recollection
and
chagrin
i
certainly
did
he
had
owned
i
forgot
i
m
afraid
that
there
were
such
things
as
festivities
due
to
society
and
that
this
was
the
date
for
the
first
of
the
series
i
don
t
think
jane
even
knew
i
didn
t
said
jane
looking
regretfully
at
her
s
handsome
face
which
betrayed
a
slight
annoyance
it
certainly
had
been
trying
to
receive
daily
telegrams
from
the
travellers
throughout
the
past
week
announcing
delays
at
this
place
and
that
on
the
homeward
way
of
course
it
s
of
no
consequence
now
that
you
are
safely
here
i
m
only
sorry
jane
will
have
no
chance
to
rest
and
visit
the
florist
s
men
will
arrive
within
an
hour
and
the
house
will
be
generally
upset
i
ll
run
away
over
to
gay
street
then
said
jane
murray
s
going
down
to
the
office
and
mother
and
nan
will
be
looking
for
me
my
dear
i
m
sorry
but
olive
has
asked
a
few
friends
informally
for
luncheon
people
from
out
of
town
who
are
coming
for
it
would
hardly
do
for
you
not
to
meet
them
since
two
are
cousins
so
jane
had
had
to
be
content
with
one
brief
hour
in
the
little
home
round
the
corner
in
gay
street
and
then
she
had
come
back
to
the
big
house
in
worthington
square
there
to
begin
to
act
the
part
expected
of
her
murray
had
been
more
than
sorry
to
leave
her
on
this
first
day
but
his
father
s
affairs
were
pressing
the
office
work
had
suffered
in
his
absence
and
he
felt
it
a
necessity
to
get
back
into
the
harness
without
an
hour
s
delay
he
had
expected
to
be
early
at
home
but
his
message
showed
jane
that
even
for
her
he
did
not
mean
to
cut
short
the
work
of
taking
up
again
the
routine
of
business
at
the
point
where
he
had
left
it
two
months
ago
selecting
half
a
dozen
of
the
finest
of
her
roses
jane
with
a
long
light
coat
slipped
on
over
her
finery
opened
the
door
and
peeped
cautiously
out
into
the
large
square
gallery
of
the
upper
hall
nobody
was
in
sight
the
doors
of
townsend
s
and
olive
s
rooms
were
closed
the
ladies
dressing
for
the
affair
of
the
evening
the
door
of
a
occupied
by
the
two
cousins
from
out
of
town
was
slightly
ajar
and
a
maid
was
to
be
seen
inside
offering
a
cup
of
tea
on
a
tray
one
of
the
cousins
had
a
headache
and
was
fortifying
herself
for
a
fatiguing
evening
jane
slipped
quietly
by
this
door
and
round
the
gallery
to
the
point
where
a
staircase
led
to
the
lower
landing
a
place
just
now
embowered
in
palms
which
were
to
serve
as
a
screen
for
the
string
orchestra
she
paused
an
instant
on
this
landing
to
look
down
upon
the
brilliant
picture
presented
by
the
and
its
opening
rooms
below
the
look
of
it
reminded
her
of
an
evening
long
ago
the
first
upon
which
she
had
set
foot
as
a
guest
in
the
great
unknown
house
in
worthington
square
when
murray
had
taken
charge
of
her
and
brought
her
up
here
on
the
landing
to
look
down
upon
the
scene
in
which
neither
of
them
had
much
cared
to
take
part
can
this
really
be
my
home
thought
jane
feeling
as
if
it
could
not
all
be
true
even
yet
she
ran
quickly
on
downstairs
and
round
the
foot
of
the
staircase
to
a
door
beneath
which
furnished
an
inconspicuous
exit
from
the
big
hall
and
which
opened
upon
a
short
passage
and
a
side
entrance
not
much
used
by
the
family
this
had
long
been
a
favourite
entrance
for
murray
himself
for
it
shortened
the
way
to
gay
street
a
very
short
cut
jane
made
of
it
for
a
flood
of
light
from
the
long
row
of
windows
in
the
fell
across
the
path
and
turned
it
into
one
less
obscure
than
she
wished
it
to
be
just
now
holding
her
delicate
skirts
well
away
from
the
dust
of
the
road
she
hurried
across
through
the
warm
air
of
the
may
evening
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
downstairs
in
the
old
house
although
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
small
rooms
wore
their
usual
air
of
and
order
jane
ran
up
the
steep
little
staircase
which
led
to
the
above
she
understood
that
as
at
the
big
house
the
family
were
engaged
in
arraying
themselves
for
the
townsend
reception
she
paused
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
listen
and
observe
for
the
various
doors
were
all
more
or
less
ajar
and
the
usual
atmosphere
of
friendly
family
comradeship
gave
her
a
little
pang
of
homesickness
the
first
thing
distinguishable
was
the
fact
that
peter
seemed
to
be
having
a
bad
time
with
his
and
that
his
cousin
ross
mcandrew
was
enjoying
his
perturbation
of
mind
either
my
neck
is
bigger
than
it
was
or
this
neckband
has
shrunk
peter
s
growl
rolled
out
into
the
tiny
hall
and
brought
a
dimple
into
jane
s
cheek
as
she
listened
probably
both
catastrophes
have
happened
this
was
ross
s
voice
in
reply
anybody
who
has
seen
you
stow
away
buckwheat
cakes
and
all
winter
could
n
t
be
surprised
if
your
neck
should
take
a
seventeen
collar
this
spring
seventeen
nothing
sixteen
s
my
size
and
when
i
wear
a
bigger
it
ll
be
because
o
jiminy
i
ve
burst
that
buttonhole
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
now
i
don
t
own
but
one
dress
shirt
that
ll
fit
the
opening
in
my
white
waistcoat
your
mother
ll
sew
that
up
on
your
back
i
ll
do
it
myself
if
you
won
t
howl
at
a
prick
or
two
much
obliged
but
i
know
the
general
style
of
your
repairs
in
a
case
like
this
nan
ll
do
it
if
she
s
dressed
and
peter
s
door
swung
open
intent
on
reaching
his
younger
sister
whose
door
was
next
beyond
his
own
he
did
not
observe
the
figure
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
the
shadow
he
proceeded
to
perform
a
double
tattoo
upon
nancy
s
door
what
s
the
matter
petey
sounded
an
amiable
voice
from
within
neckband
of
my
shirt
s
a
wreck
want
you
to
come
and
splice
the
main
brace
all
right
if
you
ll
button
me
up
the
back
i
can
t
reach
below
the
fourth
button
and
mother
s
busy
dressing
too
it
s
so
inconvenient
having
janey
married
give
and
take
s
fair
play
agreed
peter
as
a
charming
young
figure
in
muslin
backed
out
of
the
door
both
bare
arms
strenuously
demonstrating
that
they
could
not
reach
below
the
fourth
button
stand
still
now
no
fidgeting
what
on
earth
a
girl
wants
her
rigging
fastened
behind
for
is
beyond
me
if
it
must
be
why
not
use
buttons
big
enough
to
get
hold
of
look
out
don
t
treat
my
buttonholes
as
you
did
your
own
or
i
ll
have
to
be
sewed
up
too
all
right
you
re
done
turn
round
and
let
s
see
how
you
look
in
front
good
work
you
re
a
stunner
and
tremendously
grown
up
too
with
your
hair
that
way
put
it
up
the
day
you
were
eighteen
did
n
t
you
of
course
admitted
nancy
with
her
comely
head
held
high
then
as
jane
s
white
skirts
in
the
shadow
caught
her
eye
why
there
s
janey
you
dear
oh
how
good
it
looks
to
see
you
standing
there
at
the
cry
three
doors
flew
wide
open
and
bell
ross
and
rufus
appeared
simultaneously
upon
their
respective
thresholds
while
a
voice
from
within
called
is
jane
there
come
here
dear
o
mother
let
me
do
your
hair
will
you
offered
jane
eagerly
when
she
had
succeeded
in
making
her
way
past
the
embraces
of
her
delighted
family
not
in
that
dress
child
mercy
remember
it
s
your
and
don
t
whisk
round
so
sit
down
there
and
let
me
look
at
you
while
i
put
my
hair
up
it
won
t
take
but
a
minute
and
then
you
shall
help
me
into
my
dress
if
you
won
t
let
me
do
your
hair
i
ll
go
sew
up
pete
s
buttonhole
i
must
do
something
for
somebody
it
seems
so
funny
to
have
got
dressed
over
in
the
big
house
i
just
had
to
come
over
here
and
see
the
rest
of
you
getting
ready
and
consulting
each
other
on
details
as
usual
where
s
your
mother
dear
nan
running
to
the
door
don
t
you
to
mend
peter
s
shirt
i
want
to
do
it
myself
all
right
townsend
nothing
will
suit
me
better
declared
peter
with
satisfaction
kneeling
in
front
of
his
sister
with
his
back
to
her
while
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
armchair
and
threaded
her
needle
what
does
murray
think
by
the
way
of
having
his
bride
rush
over
here
to
assist
her
family
and
leave
him
to
shift
for
himself
why
are
n
t
you
putting
in
his
studs
and
things
like
a
dutiful
wife
he
could
n
t
get
home
from
the
office
till
the
last
minute
father
townsend
wanted
to
consult
him
on
so
much
that
s
happened
while
we
ve
been
gone
of
course
i
m
going
back
before
he
comes
responded
jane
dear
me
wreck
is
certainly
the
word
for
this
buttonhole
did
you
try
to
put
your
thumb
through
it
tried
to
climb
through
it
myself
bodily
at
the
last
anything
better
calculated
to
put
a
fellow
into
a
lovely
frame
of
mind
for
an
affair
where
s
he
s
expected
to
make
himself
agreeable
i
don
t
know
wrestling
to
get
an
iron
collar
on
a
steel
neckband
is
well
it
s
a
trifle
upsetting
to
the
nerves
be
sure
you
get
that
buttonhole
the
right
size
better
try
the
in
it
before
you
make
fast
when
you
re
done
with
him
you
can
tie
my
tie
for
me
if
you
re
looking
for
work
announced
rufus
appearing
in
the
doorway
i
can
t
seem
to
get
the
right
curve
on
the
thing
janey
would
you
wear
this
bracelet
shirley
gave
me
last
christmas
or
would
n
t
you
nancy
looked
in
over
rufus
s
shoulder
at
eighteen
she
was
tall
for
her
years
at
rufus
although
sturdily
built
had
no
advantage
of
her
in
inches
it
was
peter
with
his
six
feet
of
brawn
who
was
the
family
pride
in
the
matter
of
size
jane
snipped
off
her
thread
and
turned
to
look
at
her
younger
sister
do
as
you
like
nan
of
course
said
she
but
if
you
want
to
look
quite
perfect
in
my
eyes
you
ll
leave
it
off
good
for
you
peter
observed
nancy
s
simple
frock
and
fair
neck
with
approval
lots
of
time
for
the
gewgaws
when
they
re
needed
to
cover
up
the
hollows
now
i
ll
go
help
mother
said
jane
having
adjusted
rufus
s
cravat
to
his
satisfaction
mended
a
tiny
rip
in
ross
s
glove
and
given
her
father
a
hug
since
his
dressing
was
completed
and
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
she
could
do
for
him
he
had
held
her
fast
regardless
of
her
bridal
attire
for
he
had
missed
her
sorely
during
her
two
months
absence
and
the
thought
that
however
often
she
might
seek
it
his
roof
was
no
longer
hers
was
one
not
easily
assimilated
i
should
really
not
have
felt
properly
dressed
averred
bell
as
jane
hovered
about
her
performing
all
sorts
of
small
offices
if
you
had
not
been
here
to
assure
me
that
i
was
quite
right
in
all
points
as
jane
smiled
first
at
her
mother
then
at
her
father
wondering
how
she
had
ever
been
able
even
for
murray
s
sake
to
leave
two
people
so
dear
a
low
call
apparently
proceeding
from
downstairs
reached
her
ear
and
she
turned
quickly
to
listen
jane
came
the
voice
again
interrogatively
gentle
jane
you
re
not
lost
to
me
for
good
and
all
jane
ran
to
the
head
of
the
small
stairway
and
looked
down
in
the
light
from
a
bracket
lamp
at
the
foot
her
husband
s
face
smiled
up
at
her
a
bright
strong
face
it
was
ruddy
with
health
and
alert
with
interest
in
that
which
he
beheld
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
murray
was
in
evening
dress
and
as
jane
observed
the
fact
she
cried
softly
and
regretfully
why
it
must
be
later
than
i
thought
i
did
n
t
mean
to
be
away
when
you
came
i
m
so
sorry
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
i
d
been
here
five
minutes
no
excuses
necessary
dear
he
answered
when
i
sent
you
word
i
did
n
t
expect
to
be
able
to
get
away
till
the
last
minute
but
a
telegram
from
a
man
who
had
an
appointment
with
father
let
us
out
and
i
followed
my
message
home
i
came
after
you
because
mother
is
getting
a
bit
uneasy
she
wants
to
be
sure
the
bride
is
at
her
elbow
ready
for
the
fray
though
not
a
soul
will
show
up
of
course
till
long
after
the
hour
on
the
cards
i
ll
come
this
minute
and
jane
caught
up
her
long
coat
threw
a
kiss
at
her
family
and
hurried
down
you
ll
all
come
right
away
won
t
you
she
called
back
and
let
murray
walk
off
with
her
at
the
curb
she
paused
i
meant
to
have
borrowed
nan
s
rubbers
she
said
looking
down
at
her
feet
i
forgot
when
i
came
over
that
s
easy
and
murray
had
her
across
the
street
before
she
could
protest
that
she
was
too
heavy
for
him
you
could
n
t
have
done
that
when
i
first
knew
you
could
you
laughed
jane
with
pride
in
his
strength
of
arm
not
much
what
a
slim
and
sickly
whiffet
i
was
i
wonder
you
ever
looked
twice
at
me
with
pete
at
hand
as
a
contrast
i
liked
muscle
but
i
like
brains
too
explained
jane
as
if
this
were
the
first
time
the
matter
had
been
made
clear
thank
you
i
m
afraid
i
had
none
too
many
of
those
either
the
house
looks
festive
does
n
t
it
have
you
seen
the
mother
seemed
to
be
particularly
pleased
with
the
decorations
there
i
m
afraid
i
ran
away
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
notice
murray
gave
his
young
wife
an
amused
look
as
they
stood
together
on
the
steps
of
the
small
side
entrance
by
which
jane
had
come
out
an
hour
before
do
you
know
where
you
are
to
stand
in
the
receiving
line
he
inquired
jane
shook
her
head
do
you
know
whether
you
are
to
shake
hands
with
the
guests
or
merely
bow
no
you
ll
tell
me
won
t
you
do
you
know
whether
i
m
to
present
people
you
don
t
know
to
you
or
whether
you
re
to
depend
on
mother
for
that
i
suppose
i
ll
find
that
out
when
the
time
comes
do
you
know
whether
you
ought
to
look
beamingly
happy
or
coolly
composed
which
do
you
prefer
murray
laughed
a
judicious
mixture
of
both
i
should
say
well
my
small
bride
ignorant
as
you
profess
to
be
of
your
part
i
m
not
worried
about
you
just
the
same
i
expect
we
d
better
hunt
up
mother
and
be
coached
as
to
the
precise
line
of
conduct
she
expects
of
us
i
ve
never
played
the
leading
man
s
part
in
a
bridal
at
home
myself
and
mother
s
something
of
a
stickler
for
doing
things
according
to
the
latest
revision
of
the
code
well
well
he
added
in
surprise
glancing
at
his
watch
as
they
entered
the
hall
it
s
later
than
i
thought
do
you
need
to
go
upstairs
just
a
minute
to
smooth
my
unruly
hair
and
jane
ran
away
leaving
him
gazing
after
her
murray
his
mother
came
toward
him
from
the
library
a
striking
even
imposing
figure
in
black
and
white
lace
and
amethysts
between
you
and
jane
i
was
getting
anxious
i
have
n
t
seen
the
child
since
i
went
to
her
room
at
least
two
hours
ago
she
is
all
ready
dressed
early
so
she
might
run
home
since
i
sent
her
word
i
should
be
late
but
where
is
she
now
ran
upstairs
to
see
if
her
hair
was
right
is
n
t
that
the
invariable
custom
at
the
last
minute
she
is
wearing
her
of
course
she
surely
is
no
ornaments
i
sent
her
some
roses
she
ll
carry
them
or
wear
one
or
something
i
suppose
but
no
jewels
i
think
she
s
wearing
the
pearl
pin
i
gave
her
murray
you
are
quite
as
bad
as
jane
to
be
sure
her
girlish
way
of
dressing
has
been
very
pretty
and
appropriate
in
view
of
her
father
s
lack
of
means
but
her
position
now
as
your
wife
is
different
olive
insists
that
jane
does
not
care
for
ornaments
of
any
sort
but
i
am
sure
she
would
not
object
murray
to
wearing
that
beautiful
pearl
necklace
of
grandmother
townsend
s
if
you
explain
to
her
that
it
s
an
heirloom
and
that
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
have
her
wear
it
pearls
are
not
becoming
to
olive
added
townsend
and
her
son
smiled
if
you
want
jane
to
wear
that
mother
you
will
have
to
ask
her
yourself
she
s
coming
now
i
think
yes
as
jane
looked
over
the
gallery
rail
and
nodded
down
at
him
here
she
is
do
you
really
think
she
needs
ornaments
they
strike
me
as
superfluous
mother
and
son
were
watching
jane
as
she
came
down
the
staircase
her
white
figure
outlined
against
the
dark
green
of
the
palms
and
foliage
her
hair
shone
like
a
crown
under
the
radiance
of
the
lights
and
her
softly
blooming
face
made
one
forget
the
simplicity
of
her
attire
at
least
it
made
murray
forget
it
but
harrison
townsend
saw
in
the
white
neck
and
arms
a
background
for
her
pearls
she
picked
up
a
case
from
the
table
where
she
had
laid
it
my
dear
she
said
you
are
very
sweet
and
i
shall
be
very
proud
to
present
you
as
my
daughter
and
you
won
t
mind
wearing
to
please
me
these
pearls
of
murray
s
s
will
you
they
are
just
what
you
need
to
set
off
your
colouring
jane
s
face
grew
warm
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
pearls
lying
in
a
worn
old
case
lined
with
faded
green
velvet
she
looked
from
them
to
murray
an
appealing
little
glance
and
a
questioning
one
he
nodded
ever
so
slightly
in
return
smiling
at
her
you
are
very
kind
said
jane
simply
to
her
i
will
wear
them
if
you
wish
she
let
townsend
clasp
the
necklace
received
that
lady
s
kiss
and
approving
comment
on
the
difference
it
made
in
her
appearance
and
allowed
herself
to
be
led
to
a
mirror
to
see
the
effect
as
she
stood
before
it
her
lashes
falling
after
one
glance
of
a
pair
of
unwilling
eyes
somebody
called
murray
s
mother
away
jane
looked
at
her
husband
again
yes
i
know
you
hate
it
little
modesty
said
he
and
i
own
i
like
to
see
you
without
any
jewels
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
you
become
those
pearls
you
set
them
off
not
they
you
and
seeing
they
re
not
diamonds
jane
s
eyes
flashed
not
even
for
you
his
eyes
responded
with
an
answering
brilliance
as
he
shook
his
head
laughing
not
even
for
me
are
you
sure
but
you
need
n
t
fear
diamonds
little
jane
townsend
were
not
made
for
you
let
those
sparkle
who
want
to
i
prefer
a
steady
glow
an
hour
later
ross
mcandrew
and
peter
bell
making
their
entrance
to
the
long
together
and
waiting
their
turn
to
advance
toward
the
receiving
party
exchanged
a
series
of
comments
under
cover
of
the
general
hum
of
talk
my
word
pete
can
that
be
our
small
girl
standing
up
there
like
a
young
queen
watch
her
i
say
watch
her
i
am
watching
her
said
peter
with
great
satisfaction
if
you
see
my
eyes
drop
out
pick
em
up
will
you
not
that
we
might
n
t
have
expected
it
of
her
i
knew
well
enough
she
d
be
sweet
and
charming
but
that
little
gracious
manner
that
jolly
she
s
great
look
at
murray
is
he
proud
of
her
or
is
n
t
he
proud
as
lucifer
and
has
a
right
to
be
his
mother
looks
pretty
complacent
herself
and
olive
she
s
stunning
as
usual
but
our
jane
the
time
to
go
forward
had
arrived
with
head
up
and
shoulders
squared
peter
led
the
way
as
he
passed
his
host
and
hostess
he
was
a
model
of
propriety
but
when
he
reached
jane
and
murray
his
formal
manner
relaxed
and
he
grasped
each
hand
with
a
hearty
grip
you
re
a
delightful
pair
he
murmured
and
the
sight
of
you
takes
me
off
my
feet
you
look
perfectly
composed
even
bored
retorted
murray
laughing
glad
to
greet
a
brother
who
could
be
relied
upon
not
to
say
the
usual
thing
but
jane
whispered
as
she
smiled
up
at
him
i
m
dreadfully
frightened
petey
and
i
can
t
do
it
well
at
all
keep
on
being
frightened
then
advised
her
brother
the
result
s
perfectly
satisfactory
is
n
t
it
murray
you
re
not
really
frightened
whispered
her
husband
taking
advantage
of
a
slight
lull
in
his
duties
to
detain
peter
she
does
n
t
look
it
does
she
not
a
bit
you
ve
only
to
look
at
mother
was
murray
s
comforting
assurance
to
know
that
she
s
entirely
satisfied
if
she
were
not
well
she
d
look
different
that
s
all
chapter
ii
shirley
has
grown
up
as
peter
bell
abruptly
rounded
the
corner
from
gay
street
into
worthington
square
he
saw
coming
toward
him
an
attractive
young
figure
in
a
white
frock
he
glanced
at
it
and
away
again
then
back
as
he
came
nearer
once
more
away
then
returned
to
look
steadily
positive
that
his
second
impression
had
been
the
right
one
after
all
it
must
be
that
he
knew
this
girl
if
he
did
he
must
give
her
a
chance
to
recognise
him
she
not
only
recognised
him
she
smiled
outright
and
stopping
short
held
out
her
hand
the
eyes
which
were
laughing
at
him
were
eyes
he
had
surely
seen
before
peter
s
hat
had
come
off
promptly
when
she
stopped
he
stopped
when
she
held
out
her
hand
he
took
it
and
stood
staring
down
into
the
merry
eyes
with
puzzled
interest
o
peter
bell
she
jeered
softly
to
be
so
slow
to
recognise
an
old
friend
a
connection
of
your
own
family
dear
dear
you
should
go
to
an
oculist
has
it
been
coming
on
long
can
you
still
distinguish
trees
and
houses
the
voice
told
him
who
its
owner
was
though
it
was
a
degree
richer
in
quality
than
when
he
had
heard
it
last
two
years
before
shirley
townsend
he
cried
miss
shirley
i
mean
of
course
well
well
no
wonder
i
when
did
you
come
and
you
ve
grown
up
of
course
i
have
has
n
t
nancy
grown
up
i
m
a
year
older
than
she
too
and
i
came
last
night
a
whole
month
before
they
expected
me
i
was
supposed
to
be
going
to
stop
in
new
york
with
aunt
isabel
for
a
month
after
two
long
years
away
off
in
england
at
school
but
marian
hille
s
mother
met
her
at
the
ship
she
s
the
girl
who
went
with
me
you
know
and
they
came
right
along
home
i
could
n
t
stand
it
to
stop
in
new
york
and
i
came
with
them
and
you
don
t
mean
miss
shirley
at
all
of
course
with
jane
married
to
murray
then
you
don
t
mean
mr
peter
you
look
terribly
elderly
yourself
but
i
knew
you
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
not
wearing
the
same
clothes
you
were
when
i
went
away
it
was
n
t
your
clothes
except
the
extension
on
the
length
of
them
it
was
it
was
i
understand
my
hair
is
up
i
no
longer
wear
two
big
black
bows
behind
my
ears
your
cheeks
protested
peter
you
the
english
air
i
suppose
no
i
m
not
a
pale
little
frail
little
girl
any
more
thanks
to
miles
and
miles
of
walking
you
don
t
look
very
frail
either
are
n
t
we
delightfully
frank
after
staring
each
other
out
of
countenance
is
nancy
at
home
and
mrs
bell
they
ll
be
delighted
to
see
you
they
ll
me
too
laughed
shirley
she
certainly
has
grown
up
thought
peter
when
shirley
had
walked
away
from
him
toward
gay
street
he
rather
wished
he
had
not
been
so
obviously
rushing
away
from
home
when
he
met
this
acquaintance
the
little
shirley
had
always
been
a
good
friend
of
his
the
older
shirley
looked
distinctly
better
worth
knowing
but
peter
s
days
were
busy
ones
he
had
few
moments
for
lingering
by
the
side
of
pretty
girls
nor
was
he
wont
to
spend
much
time
lamenting
his
deprivations
shirley
townsend
s
appearance
at
the
door
of
the
bell
house
caused
a
flurry
of
welcoming
nancy
after
two
minutes
of
shyness
at
the
sight
of
her
former
chum
looking
so
like
and
so
unlike
herself
discovered
that
the
unlikeness
was
going
to
make
no
difference
it
was
a
great
relief
for
somebody
who
had
seen
marian
hille
at
the
end
of
one
year
at
the
english
school
had
declared
her
grown
insufferably
consequential
and
had
prophesied
that
shirley
townsend
would
come
home
spoiled
but
almost
the
first
remark
shirley
made
was
isn
t
jane
the
dearest
thing
you
ever
saw
and
are
n
t
we
just
the
luckiest
people
to
get
her
into
the
family
so
then
nancy
knew
it
was
precisely
the
same
shirley
and
was
glad
i
don
t
suppose
she
s
really
as
as
olive
commented
rufus
when
he
too
had
seen
his
partner
at
tennis
and
had
had
a
game
with
her
but
she
s
a
lot
more
alive
and
jollier
ten
times
over
and
her
playing
form
s
improved
she
can
serve
a
ball
that
keeps
you
up
and
doing
for
fair
she
knows
cricket
too
she
s
going
to
teach
us
i
m
glad
she
s
got
home
it
ll
be
a
good
deal
pleasanter
for
jane
over
there
shirley
won
t
go
in
for
society
like
olive
and
mrs
harrison
rufus
s
prophecy
proved
a
true
one
upon
the
second
day
after
shirley
s
return
townsend
senior
announced
with
some
languor
as
if
she
herself
found
summer
affairs
wearisomer
after
a
winter
which
had
been
unusually
full
that
a
and
would
that
afternoon
claim
all
four
feminine
members
of
the
household
our
men
ought
to
go
too
she
added
but
your
father
simply
will
go
to
nothing
that
takes
him
away
from
his
business
and
murray
seems
to
be
lapsing
into
the
same
attitude
forrest
when
he
is
at
home
is
my
only
standby
but
this
freak
of
his
to
spend
his
time
travelling
makes
him
seldom
to
be
counted
on
shirley
i
hope
you
have
something
suitable
to
wear
it
was
a
strange
idea
for
you
to
come
home
after
being
two
years
within
an
hour
of
london
with
nothing
but
tennis
suits
and
cricketing
shoes
if
you
had
stopped
in
new
york
as
i
expected
your
aunt
isabel
would
have
remedied
all
deficiencies
in
your
wardrobe
but
as
it
is
as
it
is
i
ve
nothing
suitable
mother
mine
so
you
won
t
ask
me
to
go
will
you
you
must
have
something
that
will
do
the
hildreths
will
expect
you
now
that
every
one
knows
you
are
at
home
marian
hille
will
be
sure
to
be
there
and
you
ought
to
be
quite
as
much
i
ve
had
two
years
of
marie
anne
as
she
wishes
to
be
called
now
i
can
do
without
her
very
comfortably
for
a
day
or
two
objected
shirley
smiling
at
jane
jane
was
indeed
rejoicing
in
her
new
young
sister
s
return
the
relations
between
herself
and
olive
although
cordial
and
affectionate
were
not
based
on
so
strong
a
congeniality
of
tastes
as
existed
between
jane
and
shirley
the
girl
before
she
went
away
had
shown
decided
promise
of
originality
and
force
of
character
looking
at
her
now
as
she
stood
before
them
in
short
tennis
dress
and
hat
with
vivacious
face
full
of
clear
colour
it
needed
small
discernment
to
make
sure
of
the
fact
that
here
was
a
girl
out
of
the
common
and
quite
irresistibly
out
of
the
common
too
i
don
t
like
to
insist
shirley
and
i
would
not
if
you
were
showing
the
slightest
fatigue
after
your
journey
but
since
all
the
apology
i
could
make
for
you
would
be
that
you
preferred
to
play
tennis
in
the
sun
with
nancy
bell
i
see
it
s
evident
i
must
face
the
music
miss
antoinette
southwode
s
searching
soprano
and
clifford
s
wabbly
tenor
and
tea
and
little
cakes
since
it
s
my
duty
i
ll
do
it
but
mother
dear
please
don
t
make
many
engagements
for
me
give
it
out
that
i
m
eccentric
that
miss
cockburn
told
me
positively
before
i
came
away
from
helmswood
that
after
a
severe
course
of
study
under
her
unexceptionable
tutelage
i
must
have
absolute
relaxation
say
that
i
have
no
fine
clothes
no
floppy
hats
covered
with
roses
suitable
for
say
anything
but
after
don
t
make
me
go
unless
i
most
awfully
want
to
promise
two
firm
tanned
hands
clasped
themselves
behind
townsend
s
neck
two
importunate
blue
eyes
looked
at
her
beseechingly
the
mother
sighed
child
what
shall
i
do
with
two
of
you
here
is
jane
accepting
her
invitations
under
protest
and
now
you
are
going
to
be
still
more
unreasonable
is
jane
another
then
why
not
just
make
a
simple
division
of
labour
you
and
olive
play
the
society
parts
and
give
jane
and
me
the
domestic
ones
my
dear
nothing
can
be
so
unfortunate
for
a
girl
or
for
a
young
married
woman
as
to
become
known
as
peculiar
of
course
you
are
not
serious
no
girl
of
your
age
is
ever
serious
in
declaring
that
she
wants
nothing
to
do
with
society
but
it
distresses
me
to
have
you
even
talk
as
you
are
doing
go
and
dress
and
look
your
best
dear
and
don
t
worry
me
with
this
sort
of
thing
i
am
quite
worn
out
already
doctor
warrener
advises
a
course
of
baths
at
a
and
i
think
i
shall
have
to
follow
his
advice
i
m
sorry
and
shirley
kissed
her
mother
with
a
pat
upon
the
smooth
white
cheek
where
faint
lines
were
beginning
to
show
then
she
went
away
to
dress
discarding
the
short
skirt
and
canvas
shoes
with
a
smothered
breath
of
regret
but
appearing
in
due
course
of
time
in
a
costume
eminently
suitable
for
a
at
least
from
her
own
point
of
view
her
mother
did
not
see
her
until
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
and
then
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
do
more
than
to
murmur
my
dear
if
that
is
the
best
you
can
do
i
must
take
you
to
a
dressmaker
at
once
white
linen
is
well
enough
for
some
occasions
and
that
hat
did
you
tell
me
that
miss
cockburn
advised
it
and
you
got
it
in
bond
street
but
the
effect
is
decidedly
more
girlish
than
is
necessary
i
should
think
you
would
want
me
as
infantile
as
possible
with
olive
to
do
the
dressy
young
lady
you
and
jane
and
olive
with
your
ribbons
and
laces
and
sweet
pretty
faces
need
a
plain
little
schoolgirl
to
set
you
off
and
i
shall
not
be
out
until
next
winter
i
m
all
right
mother
dear
miss
cockburn
was
always
delighted
with
white
linen
and
discouraged
fussy
frocks
i
m
really
beautifully
english
and
you
should
be
satisfied
girls
are
n
t
allowed
to
grow
up
half
so
fast
over
there
as
here
and
i
think
it
is
a
sensible
thing
townsend
said
no
more
until
crossing
the
hildreth
lawn
an
hour
later
she
caught
sight
of
marian
hille
at
the
first
opportunity
thereafter
she
said
in
shirley
s
ear
miss
cockburn
certainly
did
not
advise
marian
to
cling
to
the
schoolgirl
style
of
dressing
if
that
is
not
a
french
frock
she
is
wearing
my
eyes
deceive
me
she
is
charming
in
it
too
and
not
at
all
overdressed
that
hat
is
exquisite
and
quite
girlish
enough
shirley
smiled
a
protesting
little
smile
but
she
did
not
argue
the
question
further
to
her
mind
marie
anne
looked
like
a
parisian
and
her
manner
was
certainly
that
of
a
young
person
of
considerable
social
experience
shirley
did
not
like
it
her
eye
went
from
miss
marian
hille
to
murray
townsend
and
rejoiced
at
the
contrast
the
two
were
close
together
taking
their
seats
for
the
outdoor
which
was
about
to
begin
no
fault
could
possibly
be
found
with
jane
s
attire
but
in
it
she
looked
beside
marian
like
a
dainty
gray
pigeon
beside
a
golden
pheasant
i
beg
your
pardon
but
may
i
ask
what
you
are
staring
at
so
intently
said
a
voice
beside
her
and
shirley
turned
to
confront
the
interested
gaze
of
brant
hille
marian
s
elder
brother
i
ve
been
standing
beside
you
here
all
of
three
minutes
waiting
for
you
to
come
back
to
earth
and
recognise
me
do
you
realise
we
have
n
t
met
since
you
and
marian
came
back
and
won
t
you
let
me
find
you
a
chair
over
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
where
we
can
talk
this
suited
shirley
and
she
let
him
establish
her
in
a
corner
where
a
clump
of
shrubbery
screened
the
two
from
a
part
of
the
audience
until
the
music
began
young
hille
plied
her
with
questions
about
her
experiences
at
miss
cockburn
s
school
evidently
enjoying
the
fact
that
her
point
of
view
seemed
decidedly
to
differ
from
that
of
his
sister
i
should
n
t
know
you
had
been
at
the
same
place
was
his
whispered
comment
as
the
first
notes
of
the
initial
number
on
the
programme
smote
the
summer
air
and
caused
a
partial
hush
to
fall
upon
the
assemblage
he
had
been
noting
with
interest
the
change
in
her
he
had
known
shirley
since
their
earliest
days
but
beyond
the
friendly
liking
she
had
always
inspired
in
him
as
in
everybody
by
her
girlish
good
humour
and
love
of
sport
he
had
not
thought
her
especially
attractive
now
however
as
peter
bell
had
done
he
found
himself
discovering
in
her
qualities
distinctly
noteworthy
so
they
took
you
to
a
lot
of
old
churches
and
cathedrals
he
began
suddenly
to
shirley
after
an
interval
during
which
they
had
listened
politely
to
miss
antoinette
southwode
s
truly
searching
soprano
and
s
astonishingly
wabbly
tenor
intermingled
in
an
elaborate
italian
duet
did
n
t
you
find
that
sort
of
thing
deadly
dull
not
a
bit
denied
shirley
promptly
it
was
such
fun
to
hear
the
dear
old
vergers
proudly
recite
the
histories
of
the
antiquities
and
the
antiquities
themselves
in
one
very
very
old
church
there
was
a
tablet
of
a
man
and
his
six
wives
all
kneeling
before
a
shrine
he
knelt
first
and
they
came
after
all
in
profile
the
poor
dears
were
all
dressed
alike
they
must
have
worn
the
same
dress
handed
down
one
s
head
was
gone
that
made
her
more
touching
than
the
others
you
could
n
t
help
feeling
that
her
husband
had
been
harder
on
her
than
on
the
rest
he
looked
that
sort
you
see
no
doubt
he
was
agreed
hille
laughing
did
you
see
anything
else
equal
to
that
no
end
of
things
of
course
there
was
ever
so
much
that
was
dignified
and
beautiful
but
one
could
n
t
help
being
glad
to
find
something
funny
now
and
then
one
tablet
in
another
ancient
chapel
showed
three
men
one
above
another
on
their
painted
wooden
tombs
all
lying
sidewise
and
half
rising
on
their
elbows
and
staring
right
down
at
you
with
their
eyes
wide
open
they
had
pink
cheeks
and
black
hair
they
were
father
son
and
grandson
and
the
father
looked
the
youngest
their
wives
were
all
lying
quietly
asleep
at
one
side
it
did
n
t
seem
fair
for
the
men
to
be
so
wide
awake
while
the
poor
wives
had
to
slumber
and
see
oh
there
goes
brisbane
again
why
his
voice
shake
so
much
harder
than
when
i
heard
him
last
he
s
that
much
more
celebrated
said
hille
see
here
are
n
t
you
and
marian
about
the
same
age
shirley
shook
her
head
but
when
the
song
was
over
he
asked
the
question
again
i
m
three
months
older
admitted
shirley
she
looks
three
years
older
why
is
it
shirley
shook
her
head
again
it
was
one
thing
to
air
her
views
to
her
family
quite
another
to
tell
brant
that
marian
was
leaping
into
young
ladyhood
and
its
signs
too
fast
but
brant
studied
his
sister
her
blond
head
the
hair
elaborately
waved
could
be
seen
between
the
heads
and
shoulders
in
front
the
striking
hat
conspicuous
among
other
elaborate
hats
of
all
patterns
she
looks
at
least
he
commented
approvingly
she
looks
older
than
your
sister
olive
and
she
seems
to
have
that
cad
maltbie
glued
to
her
for
the
afternoon
if
that
s
the
best
she
can
do
she
d
better
take
me
but
she
s
no
use
for
brothers
look
here
when
s
forrest
coming
home
i
ve
no
idea
he
was
leaving
ecuador
before
the
hot
season
began
and
was
intending
to
stay
at
jamaica
as
long
as
it
was
comfortable
he
wrote
he
might
be
off
for
the
south
sea
islands
soon
he
s
had
a
tempting
invitation
he
s
a
rover
his
taste
of
army
life
gave
him
the
fever
i
wish
he
d
get
enough
of
it
and
come
back
things
always
go
while
forrest
s
home
altogether
between
brant
hille
and
two
or
three
other
young
people
shirley
found
the
endurable
but
its
cakes
and
ices
spoiled
her
appetite
for
dinner
and
the
moment
that
meal
was
over
she
was
off
to
the
here
she
and
rufus
played
several
sets
in
so
spirited
a
fashion
that
murray
and
jane
strolling
over
the
lawn
to
watch
them
were
moved
to
comment
upon
shirley
s
vigour
i
m
just
working
off
the
declared
the
girl
when
her
brother
asked
the
cause
of
so
much
energy
upon
so
warm
an
evening
you
should
have
put
on
your
tennis
skirt
dear
said
jane
as
shirley
came
up
to
her
racquet
in
hand
so
i
ought
but
i
was
afraid
mother
would
be
made
ill
by
the
sight
of
me
if
i
did
after
dinner
oh
how
good
it
is
to
be
at
home
let
s
camp
down
here
on
the
grass
and
send
for
the
rest
of
the
clan
run
over
rufie
will
you
and
get
all
the
bells
that
will
come
as
she
spoke
shirley
dropped
upon
the
smooth
turf
close
by
the
big
wicker
chair
that
murray
had
just
drawn
up
for
jane
on
the
terrace
at
the
edge
of
the
court
her
cheeks
were
flushed
by
the
lively
exercise
she
had
been
taking
her
hair
curled
moistly
about
her
forehead
jane
looked
at
her
with
a
touch
of
envy
in
her
affectionate
glance
being
murray
townsend
she
supposed
it
became
her
to
sit
demurely
in
a
chair
instead
of
putting
herself
as
she
longed
to
do
beside
shirley
on
the
grass
but
murray
with
no
such
restraining
thought
in
his
head
cast
himself
upon
the
turf
beside
his
sister
at
his
wife
s
feet
presently
rufus
returned
bringing
nancy
and
ross
mcandrew
olive
spying
the
group
upon
the
lawn
came
trailing
out
in
all
her
pretty
finery
of
the
afternoon
two
or
three
young
neighbours
appeared
by
and
by
peter
bell
just
home
from
the
looked
across
from
the
gay
street
porch
and
descried
the
distant
group
somebody
had
brought
a
banjo
and
somebody
else
was
essaying
to
sing
a
to
the
accompaniment
shall
i
go
over
thought
peter
when
he
had
had
his
bath
and
his
supper
and
had
come
out
upon
the
porch
again
he
was
quite
alone
for
his
mother
after
serving
his
supper
had
hurried
out
to
see
a
neighbour
who
had
been
long
ill
and
who
depended
upon
bell
for
her
daily
cheer
bell
had
driven
out
to
grandfather
bell
s
farm
the
little
house
seemed
strangely
silent
and
the
porch
in
the
early
summer
twilight
more
companionable
a
hammock
swung
behind
the
vines
and
after
a
moment
s
indecision
peter
stretched
his
long
form
in
it
clasping
his
hands
under
his
head
he
was
unusually
weary
for
the
day
had
been
very
hot
he
lay
quietly
listening
to
the
distant
plunkings
of
the
banjo
and
to
the
faint
sounds
of
talk
and
laughter
which
floated
across
the
space
to
him
so
after
a
little
he
fell
asleep
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
step
the
bell
porch
unlike
that
of
the
townsends
possessed
no
electric
lamps
and
the
nearest
illumination
came
from
an
on
the
corner
peter
in
his
hammock
lay
shrouded
wholly
in
darkness
he
could
see
a
gleam
of
white
between
the
vines
which
sheltered
him
and
the
voices
were
those
of
his
sister
nancy
and
shirley
townsend
it
s
such
a
relief
shirley
was
saying
to
get
away
from
that
banjo
i
seem
to
have
been
listening
all
day
to
the
sorts
of
music
i
like
least
rodman
fielding
and
his
banjo
are
the
last
straw
nan
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
with
me
that
i
don
t
seem
to
care
for
the
things
most
girls
do
clothes
and
boys
and
banjos
i
detest
banjos
what
do
you
care
for
nancy
asked
tennis
anyhow
and
you
like
rufus
and
ross
and
peter
don
t
you
as
for
banjos
i
don
t
think
anybody
thinks
they
re
very
musical
they
just
like
the
funny
songs
that
go
with
them
rufus
is
like
a
brother
and
ross
like
an
uncle
a
young
one
as
for
peter
i
don
t
seem
to
know
peter
he
s
changed
what
s
he
been
doing
to
make
him
look
so
old
and
sober
i
almost
thought
i
saw
a
gray
hair
and
he
s
no
older
than
murray
peter
old
and
sober
peter
himself
was
growing
fairly
awake
although
not
fully
enough
roused
to
the
situation
to
realise
that
he
was
playing
what
an
idea
he
has
n
t
changed
a
particle
gray
hair
it
could
n
t
be
why
peter
s
stronger
than
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
he
s
been
taxing
his
strength
then
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
carrying
loads
of
responsibility
solving
problems
worrying
over
some
he
could
n
t
solve
he
s
working
too
hard
nancy
laughed
incredulously
and
said
that
peter
s
work
was
quite
the
same
as
it
had
been
and
that
her
friend
s
absence
had
made
her
see
things
unnaturally
but
peter
s
eyes
in
the
darkness
opened
wide
here
was
extraordinary
discernment
for
a
girl
who
had
met
him
only
once
since
her
return
casually
upon
the
street
during
which
time
she
had
merely
laughed
at
him
for
not
knowing
her
immediately
and
then
had
walked
on
was
it
possible
that
she
had
seen
that
which
he
had
been
carefully
guarding
from
the
eyes
of
his
family
for
a
long
long
time
and
at
which
even
his
mother
did
not
guess
but
here
was
shirley
again
speaking
low
and
thoughtfully
i
seem
to
see
everybody
since
i
came
home
as
if
i
had
never
seen
them
before
i
see
father
looking
as
if
he
thought
it
did
n
t
pay
to
have
made
so
much
money
after
all
and
mother
looking
playing
the
grand
lady
olive
following
after
and
not
finding
much
in
it
murray
and
jane
absorbed
in
each
other
but
jane
wishing
no
i
ll
not
say
what
i
think
jane
is
wishing
she
would
n
t
admit
it
i
know
ross
and
rufus
and
you
busy
and
happy
your
father
and
mother
contented
as
ever
but
peter
it
would
not
do
he
was
fully
awake
now
if
she
was
going
on
to
talk
about
him
again
he
must
let
her
know
he
was
there
besides
if
she
really
divined
something
of
the
truth
he
must
not
let
her
make
nancy
anxious
shirley
had
paused
with
his
name
upon
her
lips
as
if
soberly
thinking
peter
sat
up
but
at
the
fortunate
instant
a
figure
dashed
across
gay
street
you
runaways
rufus
called
reproachfully
a
fine
hostess
you
are
shirley
townsend
they
re
asking
for
you
you
ll
have
to
come
back
so
they
went
away
and
peter
was
left
alone
upon
the
porch
there
was
a
queer
feeling
tugging
at
his
heart
nobody
else
had
seen
nobody
else
had
even
noticed
the
slightest
change
in
him
of
course
it
was
not
possible
that
shirley
could
know
the
least
thing
about
his
situation
but
it
was
something
that
she
appreciated
one
fact
that
he
was
working
to
the
limit
of
his
capacity
and
that
although
he
was
not
yet
overdone
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
not
the
strain
of
work
but
the
greater
and
more
exhausting
drain
of
anxiety
chapter
iii
luncheon
for
twelve
murray
townsend
would
like
you
to
come
to
her
room
if
you
please
yes
sophy
certainly
is
townsend
s
headache
better
this
morning
it
s
very
bad
murray
and
she
s
that
upset
about
the
luncheon
she
s
giving
cook
s
taken
sick
too
the
bad
luck
since
breakfast
sophy
t
was
norah
and
mary
served
breakfast
cook
but
got
out
of
bed
and
went
back
townsend
bade
me
send
for
the
doctor
he
says
she
ll
not
leave
her
bed
again
the
day
and
townsend
says
the
luncheon
must
go
on
and
not
a
bit
of
outside
help
to
be
had
at
this
short
notice
jane
hurried
down
the
hall
sophy
s
laments
in
her
ears
she
found
olive
sitting
on
the
foot
of
her
mother
s
bed
talking
perturbedly
with
the
elder
woman
in
the
effort
to
dissuade
her
from
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
entertain
any
guests
whatever
in
the
circumstances
but
it
became
evident
to
jane
at
once
that
townsend
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
there
must
be
somebody
to
be
had
she
asserted
as
jane
drew
up
a
chair
after
laying
a
cool
hand
on
the
aching
forehead
and
expressing
her
sympathy
with
the
headache
it
can
t
be
possible
that
lemare
could
n
t
send
me
somebody
if
he
understood
the
necessity
or
perceval
we
don
t
need
much
done
cook
had
all
the
preliminary
baking
done
yesterday
it
s
only
to
get
everything
together
but
that
s
the
whole
of
it
mother
olive
urged
you
may
say
it
s
only
a
simple
luncheon
but
norah
and
mary
are
certainly
not
equal
to
it
is
n
t
it
excuse
enough
to
send
those
women
word
that
you
re
ill
i
ll
telephone
or
write
notes
if
you
prefer
she
rose
as
she
spoke
but
townsend
waved
an
agitated
hand
and
shook
her
head
violently
you
don
t
understand
she
moaned
pressing
her
hand
to
her
head
and
falling
back
among
the
pillows
there
are
reasons
why
i
can
t
have
this
thing
fail
arlo
stevenson
is
a
most
difficult
person
to
get
for
any
affair
whatever
and
this
is
particularly
in
her
honour
i
could
have
had
a
caterer
of
course
but
i
consider
it
not
good
form
to
put
small
entertaining
into
any
hands
but
one
s
cook
s
i
am
indebted
to
wister
very
deeply
and
she
is
bringing
a
guest
whom
she
is
very
anxious
to
have
meet
stevenson
there
are
other
reasons
but
mother
olive
s
tone
was
growing
impatient
what
can
t
be
can
t
be
we
can
t
get
any
one
perhaps
i
could
do
it
jane
began
with
some
hesitation
if
it
s
really
a
simple
luncheon
it
is
townsend
spoke
with
eagerness
i
might
not
be
able
to
manage
the
most
elaborate
dishes
cook
can
t
be
too
ill
to
tell
you
what
is
necessary
but
mother
olive
protested
jane
must
be
at
the
table
she
can
t
be
in
the
kitchen
sending
in
courses
that
s
of
no
consequence
declared
jane
quickly
i
don
t
mind
missing
the
luncheon
in
the
least
they
are
all
older
women
murmured
townsend
closing
her
eyes
wearily
when
olive
took
things
in
hand
it
was
always
difficult
to
oppose
her
yes
but
jane
is
our
bride
and
you
expect
me
to
be
there
if
jane
stays
in
the
kitchen
so
shall
i
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
and
the
poor
lady
on
the
bed
among
her
pillows
looked
as
if
she
were
indeed
suffering
there
was
a
minute
s
silence
then
jane
spoke
with
gentle
decision
olive
dear
that
is
very
nice
of
you
but
i
truly
don
t
mind
in
the
least
it
is
n
t
as
if
you
had
n
t
already
introduced
me
everywhere
and
i
had
n
t
been
entertained
over
and
over
if
mother
s
guests
are
older
ladies
my
absence
surely
won
t
be
noticed
and
i
d
love
to
try
what
i
can
do
you
know
i
ve
had
years
of
training
at
cookery
and
if
i
can
t
manage
all
of
cook
s
dishes
perhaps
i
can
substitute
others
that
are
n
t
at
all
common
i
can
promise
at
least
that
nothing
will
be
burned
you
are
a
dear
child
said
townsend
fervently
she
wiped
away
a
nervous
tear
or
two
olive
followed
jane
to
her
room
to
watch
her
new
sister
exchange
her
morning
dress
for
one
more
suitable
for
the
affairs
she
meant
to
take
in
hand
this
is
going
to
be
fun
said
jane
gaily
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
think
so
it
s
certainly
very
foolish
of
mother
to
persist
against
all
odds
one
would
think
her
life
depended
on
that
luncheon
it
does
in
a
way
her
poor
nerves
are
quite
worn
out
i
ve
seen
it
for
a
long
time
having
things
go
wrong
just
now
is
the
last
straw
why
jane
what
s
going
to
happen
called
shirley
five
minutes
later
encountering
jane
on
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
servants
rooms
on
the
third
floor
shirley
had
been
up
to
see
cook
who
adored
her
is
bridget
able
to
see
me
asked
jane
she
ll
be
much
flattered
it
s
sciatica
and
it
lays
her
low
but
she
can
converse
with
intelligence
even
with
brilliancy
she
s
in
a
terrible
state
over
not
being
able
to
get
up
that
luncheon
i
m
going
to
hold
a
council
of
war
with
her
and
jane
disappeared
into
cook
s
room
half
an
hour
later
she
came
out
again
her
eyes
dancing
with
anticipation
pencil
and
paper
in
hand
as
she
ran
downstairs
sophy
came
up
with
a
tray
and
caught
the
overflow
of
bridget
s
emotions
the
cleverness
of
her
exclaimed
the
invalid
to
take
the
menyou
into
her
own
pretty
hands
and
think
she
can
see
to
it
all
she
can
too
or
i
m
deceived
consultin
with
me
and
gettin
my
directions
and
tellin
me
where
she
makes
bold
to
follow
and
where
she
s
not
quite
sure
it
s
a
pity
she
s
not
mistress
of
the
house
in
townsend
s
place
and
her
so
wore
out
she
ought
to
be
at
a
sanitarium
this
minute
look
to
it
sophy
that
norah
and
mary
does
their
duty
by
murray
this
day
if
they
re
inclined
to
be
triflin
bid
them
come
up
to
me
i
ll
soon
put
them
in
mind
of
what
murray
says
to
me
when
he
brought
home
his
wife
whatever
you
do
to
please
her
will
be
appreciated
he
says
by
and
it
s
nothing
i
would
n
t
do
for
murray
and
miss
shirley
these
seven
years
i
ve
lived
here
and
now
i
m
feelin
the
same
way
toward
mrs
murray
whether
it
was
the
potency
of
the
message
which
reached
scullery
maid
and
waitress
by
way
of
sophy
or
whether
it
was
jane
s
own
engaging
manner
together
with
the
respect
she
soon
inspired
by
the
assured
and
competent
way
in
which
she
took
hold
there
could
be
no
question
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
hour
not
only
norah
and
mary
but
also
ellen
the
laundress
were
flying
about
as
they
had
rarely
done
before
even
for
bridget
who
certainly
knew
how
to
get
out
of
them
work
enough
and
to
spare
at
a
moment
when
they
chanced
to
be
all
together
jane
had
said
to
them
as
with
deft
fingers
she
mixed
a
bowlful
of
ingredients
that
if
with
their
help
she
could
only
bring
about
the
serving
of
a
luncheon
which
the
guests
would
like
to
eat
she
should
be
happier
than
over
any
entertainment
she
herself
had
ever
been
offered
and
she
had
been
able
to
tell
from
their
smiling
interested
faces
that
she
was
to
have
from
that
moment
the
best
service
they
could
give
her
shirley
when
affairs
were
well
under
way
had
gone
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
murray
s
office
i
want
you
to
come
home
for
a
few
minutes
at
two
o
clock
she
said
imperatively
what
for
anything
the
matter
asked
her
brother
not
a
thing
said
shirley
reassuringly
but
there
s
something
happening
up
here
at
the
house
that
you
must
see
i
m
pretty
busy
you
ll
never
forgive
yourself
when
you
hear
about
it
if
you
don
t
see
with
your
own
eyes
all
right
i
ll
try
to
make
it
anything
connected
with
jane
of
course
do
you
suppose
i
d
ask
you
if
it
was
n
t
i
ll
be
there
i
thought
you
would
and
shirley
laughed
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
no
doubt
murray
was
a
happy
man
do
you
suppose
jane
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
it
queried
townsend
dressing
with
the
help
of
shirley
and
sophy
as
the
hour
for
the
arrival
of
her
guests
approached
doubts
were
beginning
to
assail
her
jane
was
no
doubt
an
extremely
capable
young
matron
but
the
preparing
of
such
a
luncheon
as
bridget
had
planned
meant
not
only
accomplished
cookery
but
much
skill
and
care
in
the
details
of
serving
had
jane
s
eyes
been
open
during
the
brief
period
of
her
entertainment
at
various
fine
tables
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
but
hope
so
don
t
worry
mother
shirley
had
urged
jane
s
doing
wonders
if
she
can
keep
it
up
she
ll
surprise
you
i
had
a
bit
sip
of
the
just
now
when
i
was
down
in
the
kitchen
offered
sophy
and
it
was
elegant
and
you
know
yourself
m
bridget
says
that
s
one
of
the
most
trying
things
of
all
to
get
tasty
townsend
went
wanly
down
into
her
rooms
to
find
flowers
all
about
distributed
by
olive
s
skilful
fingers
she
looked
into
the
her
table
was
faultlessly
laid
to
the
last
detail
and
a
charming
arrangement
of
lilies
was
mirrored
in
the
polished
mahogany
now
come
and
rest
until
the
last
minute
urged
shirley
and
don
t
worry
arlo
stevenson
won
t
have
a
thing
to
criticise
except
the
conversation
an
hour
afterward
murray
letting
himself
in
with
his
found
shirley
awaiting
him
inside
the
door
don
t
say
a
word
she
whispered
just
walk
straight
past
the
without
looking
in
mother
s
entertaining
stevenson
at
luncheon
you
know
and
it
s
a
very
solemn
occasion
wondering
murray
hat
in
hand
followed
his
sister
as
she
walked
demurely
by
the
wide
entrance
to
the
from
within
which
he
could
hear
a
subdued
murmur
of
voices
but
once
past
she
hurried
him
by
a
circuitous
route
to
a
narrow
hallway
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
led
to
the
kitchen
here
she
stationed
him
and
bade
him
push
the
door
open
a
cautious
crack
and
peep
within
he
obeyed
her
shirley
stood
behind
him
alive
with
anticipation
while
she
watched
her
brother
s
shoulders
shirley
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
heard
his
subdued
exclamation
as
he
gazed
at
the
scene
within
she
knew
what
it
was
the
luncheon
had
reached
the
salad
course
jane
was
arranging
plates
picturesque
with
an
enticing
combination
of
ingredients
crisp
and
cool
her
fair
arms
were
bared
to
the
elbow
her
cheeks
were
flushed
at
her
right
hand
mary
was
ready
with
assistance
her
eyes
respectfully
studying
the
arrangement
not
of
the
salad
but
of
her
young
mistress
s
hair
which
was
certainly
worth
studying
for
its
effective
simplicity
the
maid
could
never
hope
to
match
that
daintiness
of
arrangement
with
her
own
locks
but
she
meant
to
try
murray
turned
about
at
last
well
by
jove
he
exploded
softly
how
does
this
come
about
shirley
noiselessly
closed
the
door
and
explained
in
a
whisper
murray
s
eyes
grew
eloquent
as
he
listened
the
little
trump
was
his
comment
i
wish
i
could
stay
till
she
s
finished
i
suppose
it
would
n
t
do
to
call
her
out
now
mercy
no
you
might
upset
her
so
far
i
don
t
think
the
least
thing
has
gone
wrong
what
possessed
mother
to
put
the
thing
through
anyhow
jane
ought
to
be
in
there
with
the
others
it
was
something
about
entertaining
arlo
stevenson
mother
felt
it
must
be
done
though
the
heavens
fell
they
nearly
did
fall
till
jane
came
under
and
held
them
up
as
for
jane
s
being
at
the
table
she
did
n
t
want
to
be
there
and
olive
would
n
t
be
without
her
so
there
s
nothing
noticeable
they
re
all
women
of
mother
s
age
on
some
special
board
of
charities
or
something
like
that
that
makes
them
congenial
its
making
them
congenial
does
n
t
necessarily
follow
unfortunately
so
olive
stayed
out
did
she
that
s
one
count
for
olive
why
is
n
t
she
helping
jane
though
jane
would
n
t
have
either
of
us
in
the
kitchen
olive
did
the
flowers
and
norah
and
i
the
table
i
got
in
an
english
fashion
or
two
that
will
either
drive
mother
to
distraction
or
fill
her
with
pride
i
forgot
to
tell
her
and
shirley
began
to
laugh
she
led
murray
away
to
safer
regions
but
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
he
must
be
off
wasn
t
it
worth
coming
up
for
she
demanded
no
question
of
that
much
obliged
for
letting
me
know
i
ll
settle
with
jane
later
take
her
out
for
a
drive
or
something
to
cool
her
off
will
you
good
bye
and
murray
vanished
smiling
to
himself
that
ought
to
make
her
pretty
solid
with
mother
he
reflected
as
he
raced
to
his
car
but
when
the
last
guest
had
rustled
away
townsend
was
in
no
condition
to
fall
upon
jane
s
neck
and
overwhelm
her
with
thanks
instead
she
had
to
be
carried
to
her
room
by
phelps
the
coachman
summoned
in
haste
from
the
stable
and
put
to
bed
by
her
daughters
her
physician
arrived
in
short
order
and
his
edict
when
he
had
telephoned
for
a
nurse
was
stern
when
you
society
women
stop
putting
yourselves
through
a
grind
that
no
strong
man
could
stand
up
under
you
will
get
a
grip
upon
your
nerves
said
he
townsend
was
at
the
end
of
her
forces
two
months
ago
and
i
told
her
so
she
has
simply
been
keeping
up
on
will
with
the
inevitable
result
the
moment
she
is
fit
to
travel
she
must
get
off
to
the
quietest
place
on
my
list
and
stay
there
home
would
be
a
better
place
for
her
if
she
would
obey
the
rules
but
she
won
t
so
that
settles
it
and
you
miss
olive
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
elder
daughter
of
the
house
would
do
well
to
go
with
her
it
s
evident
you
ve
been
travelling
along
the
same
road
o
doctor
warrener
how
absurd
you
are
i
m
perfectly
well
and
i
ve
half
a
dozen
invitations
to
lovely
places
they
ll
do
me
far
more
good
than
going
to
some
invalid
resort
and
taking
baths
he
shook
his
head
you
re
all
alike
said
he
i
may
talk
till
i
m
dumb
you
ll
pay
the
price
and
when
you
ve
paid
it
you
ll
remember
there
are
two
said
olive
indicating
jane
and
shirley
who
will
never
have
nervous
prostration
on
account
of
overdoing
society
doctor
warrener
surveyed
them
and
the
grimness
of
his
face
relaxed
i
ll
acquit
them
on
their
faces
said
he
tell
your
husband
murray
to
shut
you
up
in
a
bandbox
or
better
take
you
off
west
to
that
place
where
he
got
back
his
health
before
he
lets
you
drift
into
the
swirl
as
for
shirley
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
if
i
m
any
reader
of
destiny
and
i
ought
to
be
she
s
going
to
swing
that
tennis
racquet
for
several
years
yet
before
she
gives
up
and
settles
down
all
this
had
happened
before
townsend
and
murray
came
home
townsend
s
breakdowns
after
fatigue
in
fulfilling
her
engagements
and
the
summoning
of
the
doctor
had
become
too
frequent
occurrences
to
imply
the
sending
for
her
husband
the
orders
away
for
rest
and
recuperation
were
also
within
the
last
few
years
of
recurrence
it
simply
means
said
murray
pacing
with
jane
up
and
down
the
long
walk
between
the
house
and
the
it
simply
means
six
weeks
or
two
months
for
you
to
try
your
hand
at
being
mistress
of
the
establishment
and
judging
by
what
i
saw
that
hand
do
jane
looked
quickly
up
at
him
i
should
say
that
it
was
competent
to
run
anything
that
salad
was
a
what
do
women
say
a
symphony
a
star
not
that
i
care
much
for
salads
myself
but
to
see
you
putting
it
together
murray
you
didn
t
didn
t
i
you
had
on
a
checked
apron
that
came
up
over
your
shoulders
your
sleeves
were
short
and
your
hair
curled
round
your
ears
the
way
it
does
on
damp
days
you
where
were
you
how
did
you
know
who
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
which
you
forgot
to
lock
never
in
my
life
was
i
so
bowled
over
by
the
sight
of
a
girl
in
a
kitchen
if
i
had
known
you
were
looking
precisely
that
was
why
shirley
wouldn
t
let
me
call
you
out
of
course
i
should
have
kissed
you
i
never
felt
more
like
it
and
that
might
have
endangered
the
composition
of
the
salad
i
m
afraid
it
would
laughed
jane
as
it
was
i
made
the
one
real
mistake
of
the
luncheon
i
sent
that
salad
in
on
the
game
plates
the
girls
were
in
such
a
flurry
they
did
n
t
notice
till
the
plates
began
to
come
out
again
i
hope
mother
did
n
t
mind
very
much
i
ll
warrant
nobody
else
did
arlo
stevenson
is
as
as
an
owl
in
the
and
as
i
understand
it
stevenson
was
the
guest
who
counted
goodness
knows
why
i
think
she
s
insufferable
i
m
glad
mother
s
got
her
off
her
mind
for
the
time
being
it
will
give
her
a
chance
to
recuperate
poor
mother
she
misses
a
lot
of
fun
does
n
t
she
she
thinks
it
s
we
who
miss
it
perhaps
we
can
show
her
better
some
day
when
we
ve
been
very
good
and
earned
that
house
by
ourselves
hi
what
exclaimed
murray
how
you
jumped
did
you
think
that
house
by
ourselves
was
n
t
really
to
materialise
some
day
i
wasn
t
sure
jane
s
voice
was
low
she
did
not
mean
to
show
how
much
she
cared
or
how
she
longed
to
believe
definitely
in
a
prospect
which
as
yet
had
not
been
in
so
many
words
held
out
to
her
why
it
s
a
certainty
have
n
t
i
made
that
clear
little
girl
you
know
when
i
told
you
how
anxious
father
was
to
have
us
live
with
them
i
said
it
would
n
t
be
for
all
time
don
t
you
remember
that
i
know
but
i
thought
you
thought
i
see
it
meant
while
he
needed
me
which
would
be
as
long
as
he
lived
no
he
does
n
t
insist
on
that
it
was
to
be
only
while
he
stayed
an
active
partner
in
the
business
he
wanted
me
at
his
elbow
and
i
did
n
t
feel
like
refusing
him
he
means
to
retire
within
five
years
or
sooner
if
his
health
shows
signs
of
breaking
then
he
understands
that
i
m
to
have
a
home
by
myself
build
one
you
know
well
well
what
a
squeeze
my
arm
is
getting
are
you
so
glad
i
m
pretty
glad
it
s
not
that
that
this
place
is
n
t
pleasant
and
everybody
more
than
kind
but
you
needn
t
be
afraid
to
tell
me
in
fact
you
don
t
need
to
tell
me
you
re
too
much
of
a
born
jenny
wren
not
to
want
to
feather
your
own
nest
and
i
want
to
see
you
do
it
we
ll
begin
to
look
over
plans
we
can
talk
about
it
and
think
about
it
no
we
can
t
murray
why
not
isn
t
anticipation
yes
but
it
would
make
it
harder
to
wait
now
i
know
it
s
sure
i
can
be
good
said
her
husband
you
are
being
good
heavenly
what
you
did
well
if
you
could
have
known
what
i
thought
about
you
when
i
saw
you
out
there
putting
those
pretty
shoulders
to
the
domestic
wheel
proud
is
n
t
the
name
for
it
and
let
me
tell
you
janey
townsend
it
is
n
t
every
girl
who
could
take
command
of
the
forces
and
have
them
working
for
you
at
the
top
of
their
ability
like
that
norah
has
n
t
a
nose
and
chin
of
that
perky
shape
for
nothing
and
mary
can
soldier
for
fair
when
she
chooses
as
for
sophy
but
you
had
sophy
for
your
own
from
the
start
and
it
s
not
been
done
with
tips
either
has
it
honestly
now
have
you
ever
given
sophy
a
tip
since
you
came
to
the
house
a
tip
said
jane
money
you
mean
why
no
should
i
i
never
thought
of
it
does
she
expect
it
she
probably
doesn
t
now
from
you
or
want
it
as
long
as
you
reward
her
with
your
smiles
and
ask
about
her
invalid
brother
the
way
i
overheard
you
doing
the
other
day
she
d
probably
rather
have
your
friendly
interest
than
all
olive
s
dollar
bills
oh
there
are
several
ways
of
winning
people
s
loyalty
dear
and
yours
is
the
best
only
everybody
can
t
do
it
do
you
know
gentle
jane
i
m
a
good
deal
interested
in
seeing
you
in
the
role
of
mistress
of
this
house
for
a
while
murray
i
m
so
doubtful
about
it
you
need
n
t
be
the
commanding
officer
who
has
proved
to
his
regiment
that
in
an
emergency
he
can
work
with
them
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
work
better
than
they
can
need
have
no
fears
it
ll
just
be
a
case
of
bridget
norah
sophy
mary
ellen
fall
in
shoulder
arms
march
and
off
the
regiment
will
go
heads
up
chests
out
eyes
to
the
front
chapter
iv
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
murray
all
right
sister
i
m
at
your
service
please
come
over
to
the
seat
beyond
the
shrubbery
where
nobody
will
see
or
hear
it
s
not
a
very
suitable
place
but
it
s
better
than
the
house
this
hot
night
not
a
suitable
place
queried
murray
as
he
followed
shirley
across
the
lawn
not
so
fast
child
it
is
a
hot
night
and
i
ve
only
just
cooled
off
since
dinner
it
was
insufferable
in
the
office
or
would
have
been
if
anybody
had
had
time
to
stop
and
think
about
it
why
is
n
t
that
romantic
seat
beyond
the
shrubbery
just
the
place
to
talk
because
the
talk
has
no
romance
about
it
the
office
would
be
the
place
for
it
only
you
ve
no
time
to
give
me
if
i
should
come
there
you
excite
my
curiosity
murray
disposed
himself
comfortably
upon
the
wide
rustic
seat
screened
from
all
beholders
without
and
within
the
grounds
not
only
by
shrubbery
and
hedges
but
by
the
fast
deepening
july
twilight
fire
away
anything
gone
wrong
nothing
except
me
you
alarm
me
don
t
joke
i
m
serious
i
see
you
are
and
that
s
what
alarms
me
seriousness

not
only
serious

cross
murray

to
do

jane

me
she
could
n
t
get
on
without
you
jane
is
a
dear
and
i
love
to
help
her
but
i
want
to
be
doing
something
else
i
want
to
amount
to
something
i
want
to
learn
something
miss
cockburn
s
didn
t
finish
then
is
college
the
bee
you
have
in
your
bonnet
no
i
m
afraid
i
m
too
unsettled
for
that
now
i
don
t
know
why
once
i
spent
a
whole
week
trying
to
convince
mother
i
must
go
to
college
instead
of
to
school
in
england
but
i
don
t
want
that
any
more
i
want
murray
please
don
t
laugh
when
i
tell
you
why
should
i
laugh
it
s
plain
you
mean
business
of
some
sort
and
i
m
honoured
by
your
confidence
go
ahead
little
girl
and
don
t
be
afraid
of
your
big
brother
well
then
i
want
to
learn
stenography
and
typewriting
it
came
with
a
rush
and
after
it
shirley
sat
still
one
hand
holding
the
other
tightly
while
she
waited
for
the
explosion
she
expected
it
did
not
come
murray
turned
his
head
until
she
could
feel
that
he
was
looking
directly
at
her
through
the
dim
light
he
sat
up
slightly
and
thrust
his
hands
deeper
down
into
his
pockets
a
masculine
action
which
usually
indicates
concentration
of
attention
he
was
silent
for
a
full
minute
before
he
spoke
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
the
tone
that
one
man
uses
to
another
when
the
basis
of
their
intercourse
is
that
of
mutual
respect
would
you
mind
giving
me
your
idea
it
s
plain
you
have
thought
something
out
to
the
end
i
need
to
know
it
from
the
beginning
if
you
want
any
advice
worth
while
i
can
now
i
know
that
you
re
not
going
to
knock
me
down
with
arguments
against
it
before
you
know
mine
for
it
that
would
be
poor
policy
that
s
the
boomerang
sort
of
argument
the
one
that
comes
back
at
one
s
self
besides
i
ve
too
much
confidence
in
my
sister
s
good
judgment
to
believe
that
she
would
fire
a
proposition
like
that
at
me
without
a
reason
back
of
it
the
reason
is
easy
i
m
restless
for
something
to
do
i
don
t
want
to
be
a
next
season
s
debutante
and
go
through
a
winter
like
the
five
olive
has
spent
i
want
to
work
i
want
to
fit
myself
to
be
independent
if
anything
should
happen
to
father
s
money
i
don
t
want
to
be
like
the
desmond
girls
after
their
father
s
failure
as
helpless
as
baby
birds
pushed
out
of
the
nest
olive
could
n
t
do
a
thing
forrest
is
just
an
idler
you
have
jane
to
take
care
of
but
i
i
could
be
learning
to
support
myself
the
business
is
in
fine
condition
we
never
were
so
substantial
a
firm
as
now
there
s
very
little
danger
of
our
going
to
pot
that
may
be
said
shirley
though
things
do
happen
murray
out
of
a
clear
sky
but
that
s
not
my
real
reason
my
real
reason
is
a
genuine
great
big
longing
to
amount
to
something
i
never
come
down
to
the
office
without
envying
the
girls
i
see
there
i
envy
them
because
they
have
to
do
it
because
they
re
supporting
themselves
and
somebody
else
by
it
do
you
mean
that
you
would
like
a
position
in
our
office
oh
would
n
t
i
if
i
could
study
and
study
and
practise
and
practise
and
then
some
day
take
a
dictation
from
you
or
father
and
bring
you
a
perfect
copy
i
believe
i
d
be
murray
i
d
be
the
happiest
girl
that
ever
lived
you
mean
that
do
you
i
do
have
you
thought
that
if
you
took
a
position
in
our
office
or
in
any
other
you
d
be
shutting
out
some
poor
girl
who
really
needs
the
salary
yes
i
ve
thought
of
it
i
know
that
s
an
argument
against
it
but
murray
don
t
you
think
the
rich
men
s
daughters
need
employment
sometimes
quite
as
much
as
the
poor
ones
do
why
i
m
telling
you
i
envy
the
poor
ones
i
know
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
need
the
money
and
you
don
t
are
n
t
you
keeping
some
poor
man
out
of
the
salary
you
get
by
taking
the
place
of
father
s
right
hand
man
murray
laughed
there
s
a
for
me
but
i
m
practically
a
partner
you
know
and
a
firm
can
t
do
without
its
heads
no
matter
how
many
poor
fellows
would
like
the
job
and
you
have
the
right
to
make
something
of
yourself
but
i
have
n
t
because
i
should
be
taking
work
away
from
some
girl
who
needs
it
i
don
t
want
to
do
that
i
d
work
for
nothing
or
give
my
salary
away
ah
but
that
wouldn
t
solve
the
problem
the
girl
whose
job
you
took
from
her
would
n
t
accept
your
salary
from
you
then
just
because
a
girl
s
father
can
support
her
must
she
give
up
learning
how
to
support
herself
and
the
fun
of
doing
it
what
do
you
expect
the
family
to
say
about
it
of
course
they
won
t
like
it
except
father
i
think
he
will
possibly
after
you
have
wheedled
him
and
hung
round
his
neck
well
do
you
feel
you
have
a
right
to
disappoint
mother
and
olive
as
you
will
do
if
you
so
much
as
begin
on
this
course
to
say
nothing
of
sticking
to
it
shirley
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
answered
very
gently
i
should
be
sorry
for
that
of
course
but
i
think
i
have
the
right
devoting
one
s
self
to
society
can
t
be
a
duty
one
owes
to
one
s
family
if
one
does
n
t
feel
satisfied
with
that
life
and
my
learning
to
earn
my
own
living
won
t
disgrace
my
family
not
in
these
days
of
millionaire
milliners
and
violet
raisers
no
it
won
t
disgrace
your
family
instead
it
makes
one
member
of
it
sit
up
and
look
at
his
small
sister
with
a
good
deal
of
respect
if
you
take
hold
of
the
thing
you
ll
go
through
with
it
i
ve
not
the
least
doubt
of
that
for
you
re
no
quitter
thank
you
then
will
you
go
with
me
to
talk
with
father
about
it
when
now
he
s
in
the
library
murray
got
up
you
are
in
earnest
he
remarked
yes
i
ll
go
with
you
but
you
ll
find
the
question
will
have
to
be
pretty
thoroughly
threshed
out
with
him
before
he
agrees
he
employs
none
but
experts
you
ll
have
to
win
your
spurs
before
you
can
wear
them
and
good
stenographers
are
born
not
made
if
you
ve
got
it
in
you
you
ll
succeed
if
you
have
n
t
you
won
t
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
he
could
not
see
his
sister
s
eyes
but
he
could
read
the
determination
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
that
it
was
the
expectation
of
winning
those
spurs
that
made
her
heart
jump
just
to
think
about
it
it
was
a
fortnight
after
this
talk
and
the
longer
and
more
earnest
one
which
succeeded
it
that
coming
away
from
the
factory
one
warm
july
afternoon
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
peter
bell
happened
upon
his
young
neighbour
in
a
most
unexpected
place
far
downtown
blocks
below
the
usual
shopping
district
he
saw
shirley
townsend
come
out
of
a
doorway
and
start
rapidly
up
the
street
she
had
not
seen
him
and
he
was
too
far
away
to
call
to
her
so
he
was
forced
to
quicken
his
pace
almost
to
a
run
to
overtake
her
at
the
next
corner
before
she
signalled
her
car
she
had
walked
so
fast
that
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
run
and
swing
himself
aboard
the
same
car
just
as
it
got
under
way
the
car
was
full
and
shirley
herself
was
obliged
to
stand
clinging
to
a
strap
peter
secured
a
strap
beside
her
there
was
little
chance
for
conversation
during
the
long
ride
uptown
but
peter
s
eyes
were
observant
and
he
noticed
a
peculiarity
in
shirley
s
attire
at
an
hour
in
the
afternoon
when
the
girls
of
her
sort
would
all
be
wearing
light
frocks
and
ribbons
shirley
was
dressed
like
the
girls
in
the
office
he
had
just
left
with
a
difference
which
peter
s
eyes
also
discerned
although
he
could
not
have
told
just
where
the
difference
lay
shirley
s
white
blouse
her
blue
serge
skirt
her
sailor
hat
her
trim
shoes
all
bore
about
them
the
stamp
of
quality
indefinable
yet
not
to
be
denied
as
for
her
face
peter
thought
he
had
never
seen
it
so
alight
with
life
the
smile
she
had
flashed
at
him
was
brilliant
he
was
glad
he
had
caught
the
car
it
was
a
decided
enlivenment
of
the
long
ride
monotonous
with
daily
repetition
just
to
stand
beside
the
trim
swaying
figure
and
occasionally
exchange
a
word
with
its
possessor
besides
he
was
feeling
not
a
little
curiosity
as
to
the
errand
which
had
taken
her
to
a
place
where
hung
the
sign
of
a
commercial
college
it
is
a
hot
day
isn
t
it
observed
shirley
when
he
had
handed
her
off
the
car
and
they
were
walking
up
gay
street
toward
worthington
square
just
the
day
to
get
into
the
country
i
d
like
a
gallop
over
about
ten
miles
of
good
roads
just
to
feel
the
wind
in
my
face
it
would
be
great
would
n
t
it
agreed
peter
she
looked
up
at
him
you
and
olive
don
t
ride
as
much
as
you
used
to
she
has
n
t
seemed
to
care
for
it
for
the
last
year
or
so
hasn
t
she
asked
you
to
ride
grayback
whenever
you
wanted
she
s
been
very
kind
about
offering
him
but
i
don
t
like
to
go
over
and
order
him
out
myself
he
s
pining
for
exercise
so
is
pretty
polly
though
i
had
one
short
canter
on
her
before
breakfast
you
ve
never
been
out
with
me
on
horseback
perhaps
you
don
t
know
i
can
ride
i
have
my
eyesight
and
as
for
inviting
you
to
go
with
me
how
can
i
when
you
have
the
horses
if
you
re
asking
me
to
go
with
you
there
s
nothing
on
earth
i
d
rather
do
just
now
i
believe
that
thought
shirley
as
she
ran
into
the
house
to
change
her
clothes
if
ever
a
man
looked
as
if
he
d
like
to
drop
his
cares
and
get
off
on
a
horse
s
back
peter
does
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
crossing
the
lawn
in
her
riding
habit
crop
in
hand
peter
met
her
himself
in
riding
trim
his
face
showed
his
pleasure
in
the
prospect
as
he
put
her
up
and
swung
into
his
own
saddle
if
wishes
were
horses
he
quoted
as
they
turned
toward
the
northboro
road
and
sometimes
they
are
an
hour
ago
i
was
looking
out
of
the
office
window
at
the
factory
and
wishing
for
this
very
sort
of
thing
i
ought
to
see
grandfather
bell
do
you
mind
if
we
go
that
way
i
m
fond
of
that
way
it
will
give
us
a
good
gallop
down
the
old
turnpike
and
a
cool
walk
through
the
woods
to
freshen
the
horses
once
out
of
the
city
they
were
off
at
a
brisk
trot
talking
a
little
now
and
then
but
mostly
busy
with
thoughts
they
had
seen
so
little
of
each
other
since
shirley
s
return
that
a
sense
of
having
begun
a
new
acquaintanceship
hampered
them
both
they
had
not
yet
found
common
ground
now
for
the
gallop
said
shirley
as
they
rounded
a
turn
and
came
out
upon
a
long
level
stretch
of
road
with
few
vehicles
in
sight
this
is
the
spot
where
your
sister
lost
most
of
her
hairpins
when
she
took
her
first
ride
with
me
said
peter
indicating
to
grayback
that
a
change
of
pace
was
in
order
i
don
t
think
she
d
ever
had
such
a
dashing
before
off
are
you
well
well
you
do
mean
business
don
t
you
all
right
i
m
with
you
but
don
t
expect
me
to
recover
the
hairpins
he
called
as
grayback
picked
up
the
pace
pretty
polly
had
set
but
both
pretty
polly
and
her
rider
were
evidently
on
their
mettle
and
grayback
bigger
and
longer
of
stride
though
he
was
had
to
look
to
his
heels
to
keep
up
with
the
little
brown
mare
shirley
proved
a
daring
rider
and
before
she
finally
pulled
polly
down
to
a
canter
she
certainly
had
felt
the
wind
in
her
face
with
a
rush
when
she
looked
round
at
peter
as
they
entered
the
course
of
road
which
succeeded
the
turnpike
she
met
a
brighter
smile
than
she
had
seen
on
his
face
since
she
came
home
two
months
before
once
more
for
the
moment
he
looked
the
boy
again
you
may
be
a
pupil
of
the
but
you
ve
taken
plenty
of
since
was
his
comment
and
not
a
hairpin
loose
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
s
because
i
always
tie
my
mop
with
a
ribbon
for
riding
like
any
schoolgirl
it
s
childish
but
comfortable
is
n
t
this
deliciously
cool
in
here
and
i
ve
forgotten
all
about
the
pothooks
already
but
having
said
this
shirley
bit
her
lip
she
had
not
meant
to
tell
yet
pothooks
repeated
peter
curiously
have
you
been
bothered
by
pothooks
lately
a
trifle
she
turned
away
her
head
and
pointed
out
a
fine
clump
of
ferns
growing
on
a
bank
by
the
roadside
do
you
want
them
he
asked
no
no
not
enough
to
get
down
for
i
said
something
i
did
n
t
mean
to
and
the
ferns
offered
a
way
of
escape
peter
was
silent
wondering
what
she
could
mean
then
shirley
said
frankly
that
sounds
rude
and
i
m
going
to
tell
you
not
because
something
slipped
out
i
won
t
even
guess
at
it
unless
you
want
me
to
i
do
now
i
think
i
d
like
to
tell
you
though
not
even
nancy
knows
yet
my
family
do
but
i
don
t
think
even
they
quite
realise
what
it
means
to
me
perhaps
you
would
i
d
like
to
try
i
have
begun
to
study
stenography
said
shirley
when
i
ve
learned
it
and
typewriting
thoroughly
i
m
to
have
a
place
in
murray
s
office
she
said
it
with
her
eyes
looking
straight
between
her
horse
s
ears
and
she
did
not
see
the
quick
astonished
glance
which
fell
upon
her
peter
made
no
answer
for
so
long
that
she
turned
wondering
and
a
little
resentful
i
beg
your
pardon
said
peter
i
believe
i
forgot
to
answer
but
that
was
n
t
from
lack
of
interest
you
took
my
breath
away
when
i
got
it
back
i
fell
to
thinking
that
i
might
have
expected
it
of
you
you
might
why
i
m
not
good
at
telling
my
thoughts
but
i
knew
you
had
a
mind
of
your
own
from
the
day
you
first
gave
nancy
bell
of
gay
street
the
preference
over
the
little
hille
girl
of
worthington
square
gay
street
was
sixteen
times
more
interesting
than
worthington
square
always
declared
shirley
frankly
how
do
you
like
the
pothooks
i
m
going
to
like
them
whether
they
re
likable
or
not
just
now
i
m
in
a
sort
of
delirium
ever
them
little
black
quirls
and
dots
and
dashes
walk
through
my
dreams
i
ve
just
one
week
of
it
now
and
i
m
fascinated
the
only
trouble
is
i
want
to
get
hold
of
everything
at
once
hold
steady
and
make
sure
as
you
go
slow
accuracy
at
first
is
much
better
than
a
fast
jumble
that
you
can
t
read
yourself
if
you
like
it
and
are
getting
hold
of
it
already
that
shows
you
are
going
to
win
out
it
s
easy
to
tell
from
the
start
who
ll
make
a
stenographer
in
the
end
and
who
won
t
that
s
what
murray
says
and
it
encourages
me
you
ve
studied
it
yourself
then
taught
myself
in
odd
hours
thought
it
might
be
useful
some
time
and
it
has
been
many
times
i
can
show
you
a
lot
of
technical
short
cuts
that
will
be
of
use
to
you
when
you
re
familiar
with
the
regular
oh
thank
you
i
ll
be
grateful
come
polly
you
ve
cooled
off
try
a
smooth
little
canter
for
a
while
at
grandfather
bell
s
peter
took
shirley
down
and
sent
her
to
roam
about
the
great
orchard
while
he
hunted
up
the
old
gentleman
and
had
a
talk
with
him
this
consumed
nearly
an
hour
and
when
they
were
off
upon
the
road
once
more
shirley
discovered
that
the
look
had
vanished
from
her
companion
s
face
and
that
his
mouth
had
taken
again
the
grave
expression
it
had
acquired
after
she
went
away
to
school
she
let
him
ride
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
four
miles
toward
home
in
the
abstracted
silence
which
had
fallen
upon
him
but
as
they
came
under
the
first
cool
shadows
she
brought
pretty
polly
down
to
a
walk
and
began
to
talk
lightly
about
murray
and
jane
and
the
successful
way
in
which
jane
had
taken
up
the
cares
of
managing
the
big
house
and
its
affairs
peter
obediently
followed
her
lead
but
after
a
short
time
she
discovered
that
he
gave
her
his
attention
only
by
an
effort
she
longed
to
know
what
was
the
matter
for
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
she
was
more
than
ever
sure
two
years
ago
she
would
have
demanded
with
the
familiarity
of
long
acquaintance
an
explanation
of
any
cloud
upon
his
brow
for
she
and
peter
had
been
as
good
friends
as
seventeen
and
may
be
when
the
families
of
both
are
united
by
certain
common
interests
but
somehow
nineteen
and
had
not
yet
recovered
quite
the
old
ground
of
mutual
frankness
and
shirley
s
anxious
questions
halted
upon
her
lips
they
had
another
gallop
when
they
came
to
the
smooth
stretch
but
this
time
although
peter
said
that
was
a
good
one
was
n
t
it
his
face
did
not
clear
just
before
they
reached
home
however
he
appeared
to
realise
all
at
once
that
he
must
have
been
poor
company
and
said
so
with
a
word
of
regret
i
don
t
mind
a
bit
said
shirley
one
does
n
t
always
feel
like
talking
and
i
know
in
your
position
you
must
have
a
good
many
cares
a
few
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
good
at
carrying
them
since
i
let
myself
keep
them
on
my
own
shoulders
even
on
horseback
they
fell
off
on
the
way
out
but
at
the
farm
they
climbed
up
grayback
s
tail
again
i
m
sorry
for
you
ve
been
jolly
company
and
i
ve
honestly
enjoyed
the
ride
more
than
anything
that
has
happened
in
a
year
we
ll
go
again
then
on
another
and
next
time
we
ll
leave
black
care
behind
altogether
or
if
you
will
take
him
along
you
shall
introduce
me
will
you
her
look
was
so
girlishly
sympathetic
and
inviting
peter
could
hardly
be
blamed
for
finding
a
ray
of
comfort
in
it
although
he
only
said
stoutly
that
would
n
t
be
fair
indeed
it
would
what
are
one
s
friends
for
and
black
care
does
n
t
like
the
society
of
two
that
s
true
but
he
s
not
a
desirable
acquaintance
and
i
don
t
mean
to
introduce
him
to
you
remember
the
pothooks
they
ll
keep
you
busy
he
smiled
as
he
said
it
but
shirley
persisted
more
boldly
for
she
thought
she
detected
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
peter
to
tell
somebody
his
troubles
if
his
conscience
would
let
him
i
ve
seen
ever
since
i
came
home
that
something
was
worrying
you
it
s
made
me
feel
badly
perhaps
just
telling
would
make
it
easier
i
should
imagine
it
might
i
ll
think
about
it
meanwhile
thank
you
for
two
fine
hours
we
re
back
just
in
time
for
your
dinner
and
my
supper
will
you
go
to
the
house
door
or
dismount
here
at
the
stable
here
please
and
next
saturday
we
ll
go
again
if
you
really
care
to
i
shall
think
about
it
through
the
week
here
you
are
you
don
t
half
let
me
help
you
success
to
the
pothooks
chapter
v
black
care
on
the
following
saturday
it
rained
all
day
and
no
or
excursions
of
any
sort
were
possible
before
another
had
come
round
an
unusual
and
severe
pressure
of
work
had
overtaken
peter
which
shut
him
off
from
any
leisure
whatever
for
many
successive
weeks
night
after
night
all
through
july
and
august
he
came
home
late
in
the
evening
too
weary
for
anything
but
supper
and
bed
during
all
this
time
he
saw
little
of
the
people
in
worthington
square
as
for
shirley
although
she
thought
often
of
peter
and
was
sorry
that
no
chance
seemed
to
favour
her
getting
at
the
secret
of
his
burdens
whatever
they
might
be
her
own
work
absorbed
her
she
was
proving
a
ready
pupil
keen
of
intellect
and
quick
of
eye
and
hand
as
she
advanced
in
the
mastery
of
stenography
she
became
more
and
more
fascinated
by
its
details
and
spent
more
and
more
of
her
spare
hours
in
practice
the
typewriting
she
acquired
in
an
unexpectedly
short
space
of
time
but
her
chief
ambition
was
to
achieve
the
ability
to
take
dictation
rapidly
and
accurately
and
to
this
end
she
laboured
with
much
zeal
nancy
bell
was
taken
into
confidence
and
became
an
active
and
interested
partner
many
were
the
hours
she
spent
with
shirley
reading
aloud
to
her
from
all
sorts
of
books
and
papers
with
a
view
to
accustoming
her
to
any
kind
of
composition
you
certainly
can
do
anything
now
nancy
said
one
day
in
late
september
when
she
had
given
shirley
an
unusually
trying
test
at
top
speed
and
the
worker
had
typewritten
it
without
an
error
worth
mentioning
i
m
not
so
sure
shirley
studied
her
paper
i
m
used
to
you
and
you
don
t
flurry
me
much
but
if
i
should
go
to
father
and
offer
myself
for
a
trial
i
m
afraid
i
should
bungle
it
but
you
can
t
get
office
practice
without
office
practice
nothing
can
take
its
place
or
give
you
confidence
i
should
think
why
don
t
you
let
murray
try
you
if
he
dictates
as
fast
as
he
talks
when
he
s
discussing
business
with
peter
he
must
be
hard
enough
for
anybody
that
evening
as
murray
and
jane
in
the
library
were
discussing
certain
household
matters
shirley
sitting
at
the
big
table
with
her
notebook
turned
a
leaf
and
began
to
take
down
the
conversation
did
i
say
that
murray
asked
toward
the
close
of
the
conference
i
thought
i
put
it
quite
differently
you
said
dear
said
jane
that
it
ought
to
cost
that
not
that
it
did
are
you
sure
quite
sure
i
must
have
been
wandering
in
my
mind
i
seem
to
hear
myself
saying
in
a
tone
of
great
assurance
that
it
actually
did
cost
seventeen
dollars
i
could
n
t
have
said
anything
else
knowing
the
facts
jane
merely
smiled
sure
of
her
ground
but
not
liking
to
dispute
it
further
murray
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
whistling
softly
he
himself
would
not
insist
upon
the
thing
he
was
sure
he
had
said
but
he
was
none
the
less
confident
it
seemed
to
bring
the
discussion
to
a
standstill
as
such
small
differences
of
statement
sometimes
will
shirley
began
to
read
aloud
from
her
a
reproduction
of
the
conversation
which
had
just
taken
place
listening
incredulously
murray
heard
himself
quoted
as
saying
precisely
that
which
jane
had
asserted
look
here
said
he
coming
over
to
the
table
and
seizing
upon
the
are
you
sure
you
have
that
straight
that
you
re
not
saying
it
from
memory
of
what
jane
said
i
said
i
did
n
t
get
every
word
you
said
but
i
did
get
that
sentence
you
brought
out
the
ought
so
strenuously
i
put
the
exact
sign
down
i
ll
give
in
of
course
but
i
ll
have
to
be
careful
of
what
i
say
in
your
hearing
after
this
you
must
be
pretty
good
at
it
if
you
caught
all
that
off
our
tongues
we
were
talking
fairly
fast
if
i
remember
you
were
very
nearly
too
fast
for
me
in
spots
conversation
s
harder
to
take
than
anything
else
do
you
want
to
try
me
on
a
business
letter
with
pleasure
and
murray
promptly
pulled
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
glanced
it
over
and
began
to
dictate
a
reply
before
she
had
done
two
lines
shirley
realised
that
the
actual
receiving
of
dictation
from
a
man
of
business
who
was
seriously
putting
her
to
a
test
was
quite
different
from
any
amount
of
practice
with
nancy
bell
murray
s
keen
eyes
were
upon
her
he
was
watching
her
fingers
as
they
flew
he
was
using
business
terms
with
which
she
was
not
familiar
these
technicalities
she
was
forced
to
omit
but
after
a
little
she
steadied
under
the
consciousness
that
he
was
speaking
not
too
rapidly
and
that
he
paused
now
and
then
between
sentences
as
if
studying
the
letter
he
was
answering
at
the
end
she
said
i
ll
make
you
a
copy
and
flew
out
of
the
room
murray
smiled
at
jane
who
had
been
an
interested
witness
of
the
scene
i
can
t
get
used
to
the
idea
that
the
child
is
serious
in
all
this
said
he
i
know
she
s
been
working
at
it
all
summer
but
i
ve
seen
so
little
of
it
and
she
s
been
so
quiet
about
it
i
forget
that
she
means
business
if
mother
and
olive
had
been
at
home
all
this
time
i
should
have
heard
of
little
else
there
s
no
doubt
of
her
being
in
earnest
she
and
nan
have
practised
by
the
hour
answered
jane
i
think
you
ll
find
her
copy
pretty
correct
i
doubt
it
she
certainly
caught
the
gist
of
our
conversation
but
that
s
comparatively
easy
for
her
memory
would
help
out
on
the
sort
of
thing
we
were
saying
but
when
it
comes
to
getting
it
word
for
word
as
a
business
letter
must
she
ll
find
that
s
another
thing
shirley
came
back
presently
and
handed
her
brother
the
letter
he
read
it
through
carefully
by
jove
he
ejaculated
and
looked
at
his
sister
i
had
to
leave
spaces
for
the
words
you
used
that
i
had
never
heard
said
she
i
did
n
t
think
of
it
before
but
there
must
be
a
lot
of
such
words
in
your
correspondence
would
you
mind
making
me
out
a
list
of
them
or
giving
me
a
catalogue
next
time
i
ll
know
them
i
ll
warrant
you
will
except
for
them
you
ve
practically
every
word
just
as
i
gave
it
to
you
see
here
when
have
you
done
it
you
have
n
t
had
time
to
accomplish
so
much
it
takes
at
least
six
months
to
make
a
respectable
stenographer
you
ve
been
at
it
but
four
come
here
and
let
me
look
at
you
by
rights
you
ought
to
have
grown
thin
no
i
can
t
see
that
you
have
of
course
i
have
n
t
i
ve
never
been
so
happy
in
my
life
miss
henley
who
is
in
the
office
is
going
to
be
married
in
october
he
studied
her
face
keenly
she
looked
at
him
with
eager
eyes
he
laughed
if
you
were
a
pauper
with
a
family
to
support
you
could
n
t
look
more
appealing
he
said
well
keep
pegging
away
and
i
ll
recommend
you
to
father
harrison
townsend
did
not
come
home
at
all
that
autumn
instead
she
sailed
for
italy
taking
olive
with
her
from
europe
townsend
wrote
murray
a
letter
which
he
showed
to
no
one
but
which
gave
him
no
little
discomfort
of
mind
i
am
much
better
away
she
wrote
where
i
shall
not
be
in
the
throes
of
the
revolution
which
has
overtaken
my
household
with
jane
refusing
many
of
her
most
important
invitations
forrest
away
and
shirley
casting
herself
into
the
business
world
like
any
poor
man
s
daughter
i
should
be
too
distressed
to
be
able
to
play
my
own
part
with
composure
i
hear
that
jane
is
not
keeping
up
her
calling
list
as
conscientiously
as
she
should
do
please
try
to
impress
her
with
her
duty
to
our
friends
even
if
she
does
not
care
to
make
them
hers
when
i
return
i
shall
wish
to
take
up
my
social
life
where
i
left
it
and
if
i
should
find
my
friends
alienated
by
the
eccentricity
of
my
i
should
feel
that
a
wrong
had
been
done
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
overlook
about
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
thought
murray
as
he
pondered
these
lines
seems
to
be
for
one
woman
to
get
another
s
point
of
view
here
s
jane
staying
at
home
all
summer
to
keep
me
company
when
she
might
have
gone
off
to
the
seaside
or
the
mountains
with
olive
she
s
tackling
big
problems
every
day
in
the
management
of
the
house
to
say
nothing
of
looking
after
all
mother
s
social
correspondence
she
s
entertained
relatives
of
ours
from
in
town
and
from
out
of
town
to
say
nothing
of
making
father
s
evenings
pleasant
and
seeing
to
her
own
family
yet
because
some
woman
on
mother
s
list
writes
her
that
jane
has
failed
to
pay
a
call
within
the
required
limit
of
time
the
poor
girl
is
well
she
shall
not
be
taxed
with
it
if
i
can
help
it
feeling
that
jane
although
unconscious
of
the
elder
woman
s
dissatisfaction
with
her
endeavours
should
have
amends
made
her
after
some
fashion
murray
arranged
to
take
her
with
him
upon
a
week
s
business
trip
a
flying
journey
across
the
continent
and
back
in
the
absence
of
townsend
and
olive
this
left
shirley
and
her
father
quite
alone
for
a
week
one
of
the
evenings
of
that
week
townsend
spent
with
joseph
bell
as
was
now
his
frequent
custom
on
this
evening
shirley
settled
down
with
a
book
before
the
library
fire
she
had
been
working
harder
and
harder
to
perfect
herself
for
the
position
which
she
had
been
assured
should
be
hers
upon
the
resignation
of
miss
henley
a
fortnight
hence
and
she
had
at
last
arrived
at
that
state
of
confidence
in
her
own
powers
which
permitted
an
occasional
indulgence
in
an
idle
evening
without
a
twinge
of
conscience
the
book
proved
so
entertaining
that
an
hour
passed
during
which
she
took
no
note
of
time
she
could
not
have
told
whether
it
was
late
or
early
when
a
slight
stir
in
the
hall
brought
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
somebody
was
there
awaiting
her
recognition
she
looked
up
to
see
peter
bell
standing
in
the
doorway
his
face
so
grave
and
worn
that
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
amazement
why
peter
she
said
and
came
forward
to
give
him
her
hand
he
looked
down
at
her
almost
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
his
hand
was
cold
you
ve
been
out
in
the
wet
you
re
chilled
she
said
eagerly
drawing
him
toward
the
fire
why
you
re
very
wet
you
did
n
t
have
an
umbrella
i
believe
i
did
n
t
peter
answered
glancing
at
his
which
was
indeed
almost
dripping
with
dampness
i
ve
been
walking
a
long
way
i
don
t
know
how
far
he
took
the
big
armchair
which
she
offered
him
but
she
stood
regarding
his
moist
condition
with
concern
his
visits
were
too
few
to
make
her
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
this
one
by
suggesting
that
he
ought
not
to
sit
down
in
his
wet
coat
and
after
a
moment
she
ran
away
and
came
back
with
a
house
coat
of
murray
s
please
put
this
on
she
said
peter
protested
that
he
had
no
need
of
taking
such
precautions
but
shirley
persisted
until
he
obeyed
her
and
donned
the
coat
throwing
his
own
upon
a
chair
whence
she
rescued
it
and
hung
it
where
it
might
have
a
chance
to
dry
now
rest
and
be
comfortable
said
she
drawing
her
own
small
chair
into
a
friendly
nearness
to
the
big
one
and
tell
me
what
s
wrong
it
needs
to
be
told
at
once
i
know
or
i
d
try
to
talk
about
something
else
first
i
m
afraid
i
couldn
t
talk
about
anything
else
first
said
peter
yet
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
talk
about
this
but
i
had
to
come
there
was
no
one
else
i
could
go
to
i
ve
stood
all
the
rest
by
myself
but
this
he
stopped
short
as
if
he
could
not
go
on
something
about
his
appearance
made
shirley
s
heart
begin
to
beat
fast
with
apprehension
it
must
be
a
very
bad
trouble
indeed
which
could
make
peter
act
so
unlike
himself
peter
the
strong
the
her
mind
went
back
in
a
flash
to
the
day
weeks
before
when
he
had
half
promised
to
give
her
his
confidence
in
regard
to
matters
which
it
was
evident
were
bothering
him
but
he
had
not
looked
then
in
the
least
like
this
it
had
been
merely
business
care
which
was
heavy
on
his
shoulders
at
that
time
this
was
trouble
or
she
did
not
know
the
signs
his
set
face
upon
which
her
welcome
had
brought
no
hint
of
an
answering
smile
the
lines
about
his
mouth
the
suggestion
of
pallor
which
was
already
succeeding
to
the
colour
which
had
been
the
result
of
the
tramp
in
the
rain
all
made
her
sure
of
her
conclusions
i
want
to
hear
began
shirley
very
gently
controlling
the
anxiety
in
her
voice
then
suddenly
as
a
startling
thought
occurred
to
her
peter
it
s
not
murray
or
jane
or
mother
no
no
said
peter
quickly
turning
to
her
no
it
s
not
your
trouble
it
s
mine
ours
only
the
others
don
t
know
it
yet
they
must
n
t
know
it
till
it
comes
that
s
why
i
came
here
it
s
not
right
to
burden
you
with
it
i
m
afraid
but
somehow
i
shirley
impulsively
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
touch
his
he
did
not
see
it
and
she
withdrew
it
again
she
longed
to
give
him
comfort
in
some
way
yet
until
the
story
was
told
she
could
not
tell
what
to
do
if
only
he
would
tell
it
quickly
but
plainly
it
was
hard
to
tell
he
drew
a
deep
breath
then
sat
up
straight
staring
into
the
fire
there
has
been
a
long
succession
of
misfortunes
he
began
slowly
i
don
t
need
to
go
into
those
though
i
thought
them
bad
enough
until
now
now
if
it
were
nothing
worse
than
those
things
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
them
i
d
shoulder
them
all
gladly
and
not
mind
it
was
property
business
all
of
it
foreclosure
of
a
heavy
mortgage
threatening
grandfather
bell
s
farm
loss
of
the
little
money
father
had
got
together
and
put
into
stocks
that
have
gone
to
pieces
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
up
to
me
to
straighten
it
all
out
and
not
much
to
do
it
with
and
father
he
seemed
not
very
well
had
two
or
three
queer
attacks
of
illness
at
the
factory
during
the
hot
weather
i
felt
i
could
n
t
worry
him
with
it
he
seemed
to
be
getting
old
all
at
once
finally
yesterday
peter
paused
then
he
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
yesterday
he
had
another
of
those
attacks
much
worse
than
before
a
man
near
him
sent
for
me
and
i
sent
for
a
doctor
the
doctor
brought
him
round
but
it
took
some
time
i
made
him
go
to
another
doctor
a
specialist
he
examined
father
and
told
me
what
it
was
shirley
in
a
breathless
silence
waited
any
excitement
worry
anything
may
end
it
at
any
time
if
he
would
give
up
and
stay
quietly
at
home
he
might
last
a
good
while
but
that
s
what
he
won
t
do
he
knows
it
all
took
it
as
coolly
as
if
it
were
nothing
at
all
but
won
t
give
up
and
he
won
t
have
anybody
told
says
they
d
never
know
another
happy
moment
and
that
s
true
enough
he
ll
just
take
his
chances
it
s
brave
of
him
and
i
can
understand
how
he
feels
but
the
hard
thing
for
me
is
i
ve
got
to
keep
still
and
stand
by
and
see
it
come
with
the
last
word
peter
s
voice
almost
broke
he
turned
his
head
away
shirley
got
up
and
went
to
him
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
standing
still
beside
him
her
heart
aching
with
sympathy
but
finding
not
a
word
to
say
in
all
his
unhappiness
peter
recognised
the
light
touch
and
putting
up
his
cold
hand
grasped
the
warm
one
he
held
it
tight
for
a
minute
for
the
sense
of
comradeship
and
comprehension
it
brought
him
gave
him
courage
to
go
on
shirley
understood
the
warm
and
close
relations
which
had
always
existed
between
peter
and
his
father
and
she
realised
with
a
pang
that
which
peter
had
not
mentioned
but
which
must
add
its
share
to
the
poignancy
of
his
apprehension
the
fact
that
with
the
loss
of
the
head
of
the
family
the
burden
of
the
support
of
that
family
must
fall
upon
the
son
s
shoulders
money
problems
were
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
the
threatened
loss
of
a
dear
parent
but
the
anxiety
they
were
bound
to
cause
would
make
peter
s
trouble
immeasurably
more
serious
when
peter
spoke
his
voice
was
steady
again
of
course
i
m
facing
nothing
harder
than
other
people
have
to
face
every
day
in
one
way
or
another
i
mean
to
stand
up
to
it
like
a
man
if
i
can
it
would
n
t
be
worthy
of
a
chap
with
a
father
like
mine
to
be
bowled
over
by
what
he
bears
with
such
courage
but
it
seemed
to
me
i
must
tell
somebody
and
you
something
you
said
weeks
ago
when
we
went
riding
together
made
me
sure
you
would
care
i
do
care
very
very
much
shirley
answered
i
ve
wished
ever
so
many
times
since
then
that
i
knew
what
was
the
matter
if
you
had
told
me
that
it
would
have
been
easier
for
you
to
come
to
me
with
this
i
think
i
m
so
glad
you
did
i
only
wish
oh
how
i
wish
there
were
something
i
could
do
you
can
you
re
doing
it
now
just
knowing
you
know
makes
it
easier
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
myself
i
could
bear
it
better
she
slipped
out
of
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
back
bearing
a
tray
upon
which
was
a
cup
of
chocolate
with
a
little
mound
of
whipped
cream
on
top
and
beside
it
a
plate
of
sandwiches
she
set
her
tray
at
peter
s
elbow
father
is
so
fond
of
this
late
in
the
evening
that
cook
keeps
a
double
boiler
ready
on
the
back
of
the
range
and
the
rest
of
us
make
use
of
it
she
explained
you
may
not
be
hungry
but
it
will
be
good
for
you
tell
me
did
you
have
your
supper
no
i
haven
t
been
home
he
owned
if
a
fellow
could
eat
at
all
he
ought
to
be
able
to
eat
this
to
shirley
s
satisfaction
peter
consumed
every
one
of
the
six
thin
sandwiches
and
when
she
suggested
a
second
cup
of
chocolate
he
gratefully
accepted
it
he
had
been
famishing
though
he
had
not
known
it
the
interview
with
the
specialist
had
taken
place
before
lunch
time
and
peter
had
not
remembered
lunch
at
all
being
human
and
very
weary
creature
comforts
did
their
part
in
strengthening
him
in
mind
as
well
as
body
when
he
had
finished
and
had
spent
another
listening
to
shirley
s
account
of
news
from
forrest
who
was
in
the
west
indies
now
he
rose
a
very
different
young
man
from
the
one
who
had
come
in
out
of
the
rain
an
hour
before
when
he
had
exchanged
the
velvet
for
the
rough
tweed
one
now
dried
by
the
fire
he
stood
before
her
hat
in
hand
he
looked
down
into
her
friendly
uplifted
face
and
something
very
appreciative
showed
in
his
own
he
could
summon
only
the
suggestion
of
a
smile
but
his
eyes
were
less
heavy
his
colour
had
come
back
and
resolution
was
once
more
in
his
bearing
you
would
put
heart
into
a
craven
he
said
shaking
hands
you
re
no
craven
answered
shirley
returning
the
look
steadily
with
her
frank
eyes
but
one
of
the
i
ever
knew
i
know
lots
more
about
you
than
you
think
and
i
know
what
you
have
been
facing
all
these
years
in
the
way
of
sticking
to
work
you
did
n
t
like
that
s
nothing
everybody
does
that
if
he
amounts
to
any
thing
everybody
doesn
t
but
it
s
made
you
strong
and
brave
you
re
brave
now
and
you
re
going
to
be
braver
yet
he
studied
her
a
moment
in
silence
then
the
smile
she
had
missed
shone
briefly
out
upon
her
as
peter
said
fervently
if
i
am
it
will
be
thanks
to
you
my
friend
good
night
chapter
vi
a
breakdown
now
make
her
come
commanded
marian
hille
as
her
brother
brant
brought
his
big
green
to
a
stand
in
front
of
the
great
building
belonging
to
townsend
company
don
t
let
her
refuse
how
she
can
spend
her
days
down
here
drudging
away
i
don
t
see
brant
tell
her
i
shall
simply
never
forgive
her
if
she
does
n
t
shut
up
that
typewriter
at
once
and
come
along
i
ll
say
what
seems
to
me
to
suit
the
situation
declared
her
brother
sliding
out
of
his
seat
and
divesting
himself
of
his
motoring
coat
whether
it
will
make
any
impression
i
m
not
so
sure
he
walked
leisurely
off
but
when
he
was
inside
the
building
he
made
a
short
trip
of
it
to
the
fifth
floor
and
the
offices
he
was
quite
as
anxious
as
his
sister
for
the
success
of
his
errand
murray
himself
welcomed
young
hille
cordially
and
when
brant
asked
for
shirley
he
led
his
visitor
into
an
inner
office
here
brant
stood
still
gazing
with
interest
he
had
not
yet
seen
his
old
acquaintance
at
her
new
tasks
shirley
sat
before
a
typewriting
machine
her
fingers
playing
as
lightly
and
swiftly
over
the
keys
for
all
brant
could
see
as
those
of
any
veteran
at
the
business
the
girl
did
not
look
up
plainly
she
was
much
absorbed
in
her
work
a
little
flush
on
her
cheek
her
eyes
devouring
the
copy
before
her
in
the
shape
of
her
held
open
by
a
device
above
her
machine
brant
turned
to
look
at
murray
and
murray
smiled
she
looks
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
brant
exclaimed
under
his
breath
she
does
no
question
of
that
it
ll
wear
off
don
t
you
think
i
doubt
it
he
walked
over
and
stood
at
her
elbow
waiting
shirley
paid
him
no
attention
while
she
finished
the
long
business
letter
before
her
and
she
would
not
have
turned
then
if
her
brother
had
not
said
quietly
a
caller
is
waiting
to
see
you
miss
townsend
then
she
glanced
up
and
rose
pulling
a
glove
finger
from
the
forefinger
of
her
right
hand
before
she
let
the
visitor
take
it
i
still
seem
to
give
this
finger
a
bit
of
extra
work
she
said
smiling
brant
said
a
complimentary
thing
or
two
in
recognition
of
her
businesslike
command
of
the
typewriter
and
then
proceeded
to
put
his
case
as
she
knew
a
november
house
party
was
in
progress
at
the
hildreth
s
country
place
eighteen
miles
out
he
and
marian
had
come
in
on
an
errand
and
were
going
back
a
particularly
jolly
evening
was
in
prospect
somebody
had
suggested
that
the
hilles
bring
shirley
back
with
them
just
for
the
evening
they
felt
she
owed
them
that
much
after
so
resolutely
declining
the
original
invitation
for
the
entire
week
would
she
not
go
it
was
a
rare
evening
for
early
november
the
air
mild
the
moon
magnificent
the
roads
like
a
floor
the
hildreths
wanted
her
to
stay
the
night
but
brant
would
rise
with
the
lark
and
bring
her
back
to
town
before
breakfast
that
she
might
not
miss
so
much
as
a
semicolon
of
her
day
s
work
or
as
shirley
continued
to
look
doubtful
he
urged
that
if
she
preferred
he
would
actually
get
her
back
some
of
the
married
people
would
drive
in
with
them
for
the
sake
of
the
run
in
the
moonlight
please
go
shirley
and
have
a
fine
time
said
her
brother
she
was
only
human
and
a
girl
after
all
and
after
many
weeks
of
close
and
serious
work
the
prospect
of
the
little
spin
of
an
hour
s
duration
with
the
jolly
evening
appealed
to
her
smiling
at
brant
s
last
proposition
shirley
yielded
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
house
first
she
said
setting
the
cover
on
her
machine
and
putting
away
her
work
the
clock
already
indicated
the
end
of
the
in
the
townsend
office
of
course
we
ll
take
you
right
up
in
a
jiffy
and
brant
led
the
way
to
the
elevator
his
soul
filled
with
satisfaction
the
green
car
was
shortly
in
front
of
the
townsend
house
while
shirley
ran
up
to
exchange
her
office
clothes
for
the
pretty
dull
red
silk
frock
which
seemed
to
her
to
fit
the
november
evening
a
sense
of
exhilaration
took
possession
of
her
as
she
pulled
on
her
long
and
pinned
in
place
the
close
hat
and
swathing
gray
veil
which
made
her
ready
for
the
swift
drive
in
the
autumn
air
to
be
really
a
working
girl
and
yet
not
to
be
shut
out
from
an
occasional
taste
of
this
sort
of
pleasure
it
was
certainly
a
pleasant
combination
and
shirley
had
accomplished
one
of
the
best
day
s
works
that
she
had
yet
done
and
felt
as
if
she
had
earned
whatever
of
jollity
the
evening
might
have
in
store
for
her
well
i
m
certainly
thankful
to
see
you
acting
like
one
of
us
again
if
only
for
a
few
hours
asserted
marie
anne
as
they
whirled
away
shirley
townsend
in
a
blue
serge
at
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
is
an
extraordinary
sight
now
you
look
like
yourself
again
what
have
you
got
on
that
silk
when
you
like
a
thing
you
like
it
forever
don
t
you
i
wonder
how
many
times
you
came
down
to
dinner
last
winter
at
miss
cockburn
s
in
that
red
silk
don
t
be
brutal
marian
called
her
brother
over
his
shoulder
as
if
it
made
any
difference
what
she
wears
as
long
as
she
comes
with
us
besides
i
haven
t
seen
the
red
silk
but
shirley
was
only
smiling
at
marian
s
comments
on
her
attire
she
had
not
summered
and
wintered
miss
hille
as
a
for
two
years
in
the
english
school
not
to
have
become
inured
to
her
style
of
intimate
criticism
besides
she
knew
perfectly
that
that
silk
frock
had
been
her
friend
s
envy
for
the
first
six
weeks
of
its
existence
on
account
of
its
beauty
and
the
way
it
became
shirley
s
colouring
it
does
not
take
long
for
a
of
high
driven
by
a
young
man
with
the
usual
dash
of
daring
in
his
composition
to
cover
eighteen
miles
of
smooth
roadway
and
it
was
not
yet
six
o
clock
when
the
car
shot
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
hildreth
s
country
place
half
a
dozen
young
people
returning
from
the
golf
links
hurried
up
to
welcome
shirley
townsend
back
to
the
ranks
of
the
and
she
was
borne
into
the
house
on
a
little
wave
of
and
merriment
which
she
could
not
help
decidedly
enjoying
it
s
a
shame
to
think
of
that
girl
throwing
herself
away
on
the
sort
of
fad
she
s
taken
up
growled
somers
hildreth
to
brant
hille
as
the
two
came
in
after
dressing
for
dinner
to
find
shirley
townsend
the
centre
of
a
gay
group
before
the
great
fireplace
which
was
the
heart
of
the
country
house
i
wonder
what
fault
marian
had
to
find
with
that
dress
brant
was
thinking
as
he
caught
its
gleam
in
the
firelight
and
saw
the
sparkling
eyes
and
cheeks
above
it
if
she
is
n
t
by
long
odds
the
finest
girl
in
that
crowd
i
ll
go
without
my
dinner
but
aloud
he
responded
calmly
it
does
n
t
seem
to
have
dulled
her
charms
she
never
looked
more
as
if
she
found
things
worth
while
did
she
that
s
reaction
declared
the
other
young
man
shut
any
girl
up
in
a
cage
and
she
ll
stretch
her
wings
when
she
gets
out
it
will
tell
on
her
after
a
while
though
if
she
keeps
it
up
but
she
won
t
that
goes
without
saying
don
t
you
fool
yourself
muttered
brant
adopting
murray
townsend
s
view
of
the
matter
shirley
indeed
did
not
look
like
a
girl
who
was
accustomed
to
adopt
courses
only
to
abandon
them
when
weary
whatever
her
views
of
the
things
worth
while
she
certainly
enjoyed
that
evening
those
who
had
sent
for
her
congratulated
themselves
on
their
foresight
without
making
herself
in
any
way
a
conspicuous
figure
or
appearing
to
take
the
lead
shirley
s
very
presence
seemed
somehow
to
bring
about
that
result
most
desirable
to
a
hostess
the
making
things
go
the
young
people
had
been
together
for
five
successive
evenings
and
had
about
exhausted
their
resources
and
those
of
their
entertainers
in
the
way
of
diversion
but
with
shirley
townsend
s
softly
brilliant
eyes
looking
on
her
spirited
mouth
curving
into
mischief
or
merriment
her
appreciative
comments
spurring
them
the
young
men
of
the
party
at
least
found
themselves
stimulated
to
their
best
achievement
and
exerted
themselves
to
bring
the
response
of
her
pleasure
as
for
the
girls
they
all
liked
her
although
not
without
here
and
there
a
touch
of
envy
at
the
success
of
a
style
so
free
from
affectation
that
nobody
could
accuse
its
possessor
of
not
being
genuine
you
can
t
say
you
re
not
having
a
good
time
urged
hille
cornering
shirley
as
the
evening
went
on
there
s
no
reason
why
i
should
want
to
say
it
i
m
having
a
delightful
time
i
thought
it
was
part
of
your
code
from
now
on
to
enjoy
nothing
but
hard
labour
her
laugh
rang
out
softly
you
did
n
t
believe
anything
of
the
sort
if
all
work
and
no
play
make
jack
a
dull
boy
what
would
they
do
to
jill
she
would
be
unendurable
she
would
but
anybody
would
have
taken
alarm
at
sight
of
you
over
your
typewriter
you
looked
as
if
you
were
nothing
short
of
carried
away
with
it
you
did
n
t
so
much
as
notice
i
was
in
the
room
i
m
not
supposed
to
notice
people
who
come
into
murray
s
office
i
learned
that
at
once
by
watching
miss
henley
while
i
m
there
i
m
to
be
merely
an
intelligent
machine
machine
doesn
t
strike
me
as
exactly
the
word
in
your
case
as
for
the
intelligence
i
suppose
townsend
company
are
very
exacting
do
you
suppose
they
d
take
me
on
the
force
you
it
seemed
to
amuse
her
very
much
brant
looked
nettled
he
had
asked
the
question
in
sport
but
he
did
not
like
to
be
taken
that
way
look
here
am
i
such
a
joke
as
that
the
notion
of
your
working
for
anybody
even
for
yourself
is
very
interesting
you
think
i
m
not
capable
i
think
the
mere
thought
of
going
to
an
office
every
morning
at
nine
o
clock
would
be
too
much
for
you
you
must
have
a
pretty
poor
opinion
of
me
not
at
all
but
you
have
never
needed
to
work
never
expect
to
need
to
work
and
have
never
shown
the
first
sign
of
intending
to
work
why
shouldn
t
the
idea
of
your
working
seem
strange
i
might
have
said
the
same
of
you
a
few
months
ago
brant
was
getting
red
so
you
might
but
i
m
a
girl
does
my
being
a
man
i
m
make
it
a
foregone
conclusion
that
i
should
roll
up
my
sleeves
and
tackle
a
shovel
and
pick
whether
i
need
the
money
or
not
shirley
surveyed
him
no
i
don
t
think
it
does
the
red
which
had
begun
to
show
above
brant
s
collar
now
spread
toward
his
ears
extended
his
forehead
and
finally
suffused
his
entire
face
he
broke
out
hotly
look
here
you
used
not
to
be
like
that
if
your
taking
up
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
to
make
you
not
mind
how
you
cut
your
friends
it
s
my
opinion
you
d
be
better
at
your
embroidery
shirley
bit
her
lip
with
a
mischievous
desire
to
say
something
which
would
make
the
angry
gleam
in
his
eyes
light
up
still
more
vividly
she
and
brant
had
played
together
and
quarreled
and
made
up
since
their
nursery
days
and
this
retort
which
she
would
have
resented
from
anybody
else
merely
delighted
her
from
brant
she
liked
to
wake
him
up
and
considered
that
hurting
his
feelings
on
the
score
of
his
idleness
was
both
salutary
and
justifiable
ever
since
she
had
returned
she
had
been
feeling
more
and
more
annoyed
with
him
for
seeming
to
settle
down
so
unconcernedly
to
a
life
of
absolute
ease
and
the
spending
of
his
share
of
the
estate
left
him
by
a
father
who
had
toiled
a
lifetime
to
get
his
property
together
but
she
did
not
intend
to
be
led
into
a
serious
argument
with
him
now
and
here
nor
did
she
wish
to
make
him
like
her
less
on
account
of
her
new
method
of
employing
her
time
she
liked
him
for
many
good
points
and
she
was
rather
wiser
than
most
girls
in
perceiving
when
she
had
said
enough
so
after
an
instant
s
silence
she
asked
with
a
bright
glance
disarming
because
unexpected
shall
we
call
it
even
did
my
shot
about
the
embroidery
hit
brant
exulted
hard
it
doesn
t
matter
that
i
don
t
know
how
to
embroider
not
in
the
least
yes
i
ll
call
it
even
though
i
got
the
worst
of
it
i
was
mad
enough
to
bite
something
a
minute
ago
but
you
always
did
have
a
way
of
making
a
chap
double
up
his
fists
and
then
open
them
again
feeling
foolish
oh
here
comes
hildreth
you
don
t
want
to
go
back
do
you
i
ll
wait
till
morning
but
we
must
be
off
early
i
would
n
t
miss
being
on
time
for
a
week
s
salary
before
breakfast
of
course
if
they
ll
let
us
we
ll
have
breakfast
at
home
the
early
morning
run
will
make
us
hungry
it
certainly
will
see
here
we
don
t
have
to
get
anybody
up
to
go
in
with
us
do
we
shirley
looked
doubtful
i
m
afraid
we
do
then
i
d
rather
take
you
in
said
brant
promptly
we
ll
fill
up
the
car
with
chaperons
and
you
can
sit
in
front
with
me
they
ll
be
tickled
to
go
in
this
moonlight
i
ll
ask
hildreth
and
miss
armitage
they
ll
discuss
dressmakers
all
the
way
in
and
leave
us
in
peace
shirley
let
him
arrange
it
personally
much
preferring
to
reach
home
that
night
and
get
up
at
the
usual
hour
in
the
morning
with
an
interval
between
her
and
her
work
the
hour
was
not
late
and
brant
professed
to
be
able
to
make
incredibly
quick
time
so
he
had
no
difficulty
in
arranging
his
party
there
were
many
sallies
at
shirley
s
expense
as
her
friends
saw
her
depart
her
devotion
to
business
was
considered
a
caprice
likely
at
any
time
to
give
way
to
more
rational
behaviour
and
she
was
assured
of
an
enthusiastic
welcome
back
to
the
company
of
sane
beings
when
her
craze
should
be
over
she
went
away
smiling
at
the
thought
of
how
little
they
understood
her
and
with
a
sense
of
having
at
hand
resources
of
contentment
at
which
they
could
not
even
guess
with
an
empty
road
ahead
and
the
moonlight
making
all
things
clear
brant
sent
his
car
humming
in
the
rush
of
air
caused
by
their
flight
all
four
travellers
stopped
talking
and
it
was
upon
a
silence
hitherto
disturbed
only
by
the
muffled
mechanism
of
the
car
that
the
startling
of
an
exploding
tire
woke
the
echoes
confound
the
luck
burst
from
the
young
man
in
the
driver
s
seat
as
he
brought
the
machine
to
a
standstill
that
means
stop
and
repair
right
here
we
can
t
run
her
in
on
her
rim
we
re
not
half
way
shirley
looked
about
her
ten
rods
away
its
big
barns
looming
against
the
sky
its
white
house
showing
clearly
in
the
moonlight
lay
the
farm
of
elihu
bell
the
grandfather
of
her
friends
although
it
was
after
eleven
o
clock
there
were
lights
showing
in
windows
which
she
knew
belonged
to
the
front
room
of
the
shall
you
need
help
she
asked
as
brant
threw
open
the
box
which
held
his
repair
kit
the
noise
has
brought
somebody
to
the
door
over
there
it
s
the
bell
farm
my
sister
jane
s
grandfather
you
know
is
it
then
we
ll
pull
over
there
into
the
yard
and
you
people
can
go
inside
since
they
seem
to
be
up
it
may
take
me
quite
a
while
to
get
out
of
this
scrape
i
m
not
much
of
a
mechanic
and
i
ve
been
lucky
enough
not
to
puncture
many
tires
he
got
in
again
and
ran
the
car
slowly
over
to
the
open
gate
of
the
bell
place
as
he
turned
in
the
two
figures
which
had
been
standing
in
the
doorway
came
out
and
crossed
the
yard
shirley
recognized
them
both
one
tall
and
slim
with
the
slight
stoop
and
characteristic
walk
of
age
the
other
also
tall
but
and
erect
she
wondered
what
peter
bell
could
be
doing
out
here
calling
on
his
grandfather
at
this
late
hour
and
then
remembered
that
peter
s
time
was
so
full
by
day
that
he
must
needs
make
his
visits
by
night
she
thought
of
the
mortgage
he
had
spoken
of
and
surmised
that
the
visit
prolonged
past
the
hour
when
farmhouses
are
usually
dark
and
silent
was
on
business
well
well
called
the
kindly
voice
of
the
old
man
broke
down
have
you
anything
we
can
do
your
lights
are
brighter
than
any
we
can
furnish
you
peter
came
close
will
the
ladies
come
into
the
house
he
asked
he
could
not
see
who
they
were
hildreth
and
miss
armitage
accepted
the
offer
for
the
november
air
was
not
so
mild
as
it
had
been
during
the
day
and
they
had
no
great
confidence
in
brant
s
ability
to
repair
his
own
machine
peter
offered
a
helping
hand
when
the
older
ladies
were
out
he
turned
to
the
girl
on
the
front
seat
she
sprang
down
and
stood
still
before
him
she
had
pulled
her
gray
veil
closely
about
her
face
and
she
spoke
in
a
muffled
whisper
guess
who
i
am
illustration
she
sprang
down
and
stood
still
before
him
peter
glanced
toward
brant
who
had
now
come
around
into
the
glare
from
his
own
headlights
peter
knew
brant
as
anyone
must
who
was
included
in
the
entertaining
done
in
the
townsend
house
but
it
had
always
been
many
leagues
farther
to
gay
street
from
the
hille
home
on
the
north
side
of
worthington
square
than
from
that
of
murray
and
shirley
townsend
on
the
south
side
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
guess
admitted
peter
who
thought
he
knew
that
shirley
was
at
home
that
night
having
noted
a
light
in
her
window
when
at
nine
o
clock
he
had
mounted
his
bicycle
to
make
the
trip
to
grandfather
bell
s
her
figure
in
the
long
coat
and
shrouding
veil
was
not
familiar
to
him
and
the
whisper
had
conveyed
no
note
of
shirley
s
real
tones
then
you
shall
never
know
the
sepulchral
whisper
assured
him
and
he
found
some
difficulty
in
holding
his
hand
from
the
desire
forcibly
to
remove
the
provoking
veil
the
possibility
that
it
was
his
sister
jane
caused
him
to
estimate
sharply
the
height
of
the
figure
before
him
it
was
a
little
too
tall
for
jane
and
peter
was
about
to
hazard
a
guess
that
it
was
one
of
the
least
formidable
of
the
girls
of
shirley
s
set
whom
he
occasionally
met
at
her
home
when
brant
hille
called
out
annoyance
sounding
in
his
voice
you
d
better
go
in
with
the
others
shirley
this
is
going
to
take
time
i
ve
got
to
put
on
a
new
tire
worse
luck
peter
s
fingers
grasped
the
veil
and
gently
pulled
it
aside
from
the
laughing
face
beneath
no
wonder
you
wanted
to
hide
he
jeered
under
his
breath
a
like
you
off
on
midnight
larks
like
this
with
ahead
but
there
was
a
distinct
hint
of
pleasure
in
his
voice
at
the
discovery
of
her
here
thrown
upon
his
hospitality
he
led
her
away
to
the
house
within
whose
open
door
the
other
ladies
had
disappeared
grandmother
has
gone
to
bed
long
ago
he
said
as
they
came
up
on
the
porch
and
i
don
t
think
i
ll
disturb
her
she
s
deaf
and
won
t
hear
and
she
needs
her
sleep
but
i
can
get
you
all
something
hot
to
drink
and
something
to
eat
too
if
there
s
much
delay
shirley
presented
him
to
hildreth
and
miss
armitage
who
were
already
making
themselves
at
home
in
the
pleasant
which
lay
all
across
the
front
of
the
a
dying
fire
reddened
the
hearth
which
peter
soon
revived
into
a
blaze
then
he
went
in
search
of
refreshments
thereafter
returning
to
the
scene
of
the
breakdown
he
rendered
brant
valuable
assistance
proving
handier
at
the
process
of
replacing
the
injured
tire
than
brant
himself
when
they
finally
had
done
the
work
and
brant
pulled
out
his
watch
with
a
hand
black
with
dirt
and
grease
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
dismay
one
by
all
that
s
unfortunate
better
let
me
take
you
back
to
longacre
shirley
and
get
you
home
comfortably
in
the
morning
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
do
miss
part
of
a
day
leave
her
here
said
elihu
bell
we
ll
take
care
of
her
and
i
ll
drive
in
with
her
in
the
morning
bright
and
early
that
s
the
best
way
out
and
you
people
can
go
back
and
go
to
bed
grandma
ll
be
mightily
pleased
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
find
the
little
girl
here
feeling
it
the
simplest
solution
of
a
situation
which
was
involving
somebody
s
sacrifice
whatever
she
did
shirley
accepted
the
offer
brant
did
not
feel
altogether
pleased
over
driving
away
and
leaving
her
standing
on
the
porch
beside
peter
but
he
was
decidedly
weary
with
his
exercise
and
sleepy
after
two
brimming
glasses
of
milk
and
he
resigned
his
charge
with
one
murmured
speech
shows
what
a
fool
thing
it
is
for
a
girl
like
you
to
play
at
holding
down
a
business
position
you
can
t
be
either
one
thing
or
the
other
with
any
comfort
and
it
even
gets
your
friends
into
trouble
this
surly
farewell
was
punished
by
the
girl
s
gay
rejoinder
i
suppose
it
was
the
weight
of
your
cares
that
was
too
much
for
the
car
i
m
sorry
and
i
ll
promise
not
to
run
away
from
my
work
again
with
you
when
the
car
was
off
peter
promptly
brought
round
his
bicycle
this
is
n
t
quite
so
imposing
a
conveyance
as
hille
s
automobile
he
said
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
looking
up
at
shirley
and
i
can
t
invite
anybody
to
share
it
with
me
and
ride
home
but
it
s
very
convenient
for
these
little
runs
out
to
the
farm
and
i
m
glad
i
happened
to
be
here
somehow
just
the
sight
of
you
without
any
chance
to
talk
does
me
good
if
that
is
true
i
should
think
you
might
take
advantage
of
living
so
near
just
a
bit
oftener
than
you
do
do
you
know
how
long
it
is
since
you
ve
been
over
it
seems
six
months
to
me
said
peter
smiling
it
is
six
weeks
are
you
so
busy
all
your
evenings
pretty
busy
and
i
spend
what
little
spare
time
i
can
make
with
father
of
course
she
agreed
gently
but
i
think
you
need
a
little
more
change
of
scene
than
you
get
i
d
like
it
but
i
can
t
be
bothering
a
girl
like
you
with
entertaining
an
old
chap
like
me
an
old
chap
mused
shirley
is
that
the
way
you
feel
i
was
feeling
forty
at
least
till
the
tire
blew
up
then
i
came
down
to
thirty
when
i
found
the
girl
under
the
veil
i
dropped
off
several
years
more
but
when
i
looked
at
that
boy
hille
i
became
a
patriarch
again
i
wish
he
could
hear
you
call
him
a
boy
suppose
i
give
you
a
special
invitation
and
run
the
risk
of
your
bothering
me
will
you
accept
it
in
a
hurry
your
first
spare
evening
then
you
tempt
me
to
cut
everything
and
come
night
no
i
ll
wait
a
decent
interval
to
let
you
get
caught
up
after
this
midnight
dissipation
may
i
come
early
the
earlier
the
better
and
you
won
t
invite
anybody
else
to
help
make
it
jolly
for
me
the
last
time
i
ventured
over
you
had
a
roomful
i
ll
invite
nobody
come
peter
bell
do
you
know
i
m
being
much
nicer
to
you
than
i
ordinarily
am
to
anybody
i
let
mother
and
olive
do
the
inviting
and
i
just
look
demure
as
if
i
did
n
t
care
you
do
care
then
this
time
it
s
time
you
were
off
is
n
t
it
and
she
retreated
laughing
to
the
open
door
peter
looked
back
at
her
an
alluring
figure
with
the
lamplight
falling
over
the
dull
red
silk
of
her
frock
and
wished
he
need
not
go
at
all
but
grandfather
bell
s
tall
form
appeared
just
behind
shirley
s
this
was
an
hour
for
grandfather
bell
so
with
a
friendly
good
night
and
a
warm
feeling
at
his
heart
peter
bestrode
his
wheel
and
was
off
down
the
moonlit
road
toward
home
chapter
vii
christmas
greens
jane
i
ve
the
most
charming
plan
in
my
head
for
christmas
week
you
ever
heard
of
have
you
shirley
dear
and
are
you
going
to
tell
it
to
me
i
am
indeed
listen
let
s
take
cook
and
norah
and
go
all
of
us
your
houseful
and
ours
and
spend
part
of
holiday
week
at
grasslands
shirley
you
take
my
breath
away
could
we
do
it
would
n
t
it
be
fun
if
we
could
i
don
t
see
a
thing
in
the
way
when
i
stayed
overnight
in
november
your
grandmother
bell
said
she
wished
she
could
get
her
family
together
once
more
at
christmas
there
instead
of
going
in
to
have
dinner
in
gay
street
as
they
ve
been
doing
since
your
family
went
to
live
in
town
she
said
she
d
like
to
have
us
all
if
she
were
younger
again
but
she
has
no
help
and
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
ask
us
and
then
have
your
mother
and
nan
do
the
work
i
ve
thought
about
it
ever
so
many
times
since
but
this
idea
has
only
just
popped
into
my
head
i
should
think
it
could
be
done
mused
jane
there
are
rooms
and
rooms
at
the
farm
and
little
open
in
every
one
you
and
i
could
go
out
the
day
before
and
get
everything
aired
and
ready
what
if
you
and
bell
and
nan
and
i
went
without
telling
any
of
the
men
i
m
to
have
christmas
week
for
my
first
vacation
you
know
then
when
they
came
home
in
the
evening
have
a
bouncing
big
sleigh
ready
to
carry
them
off
to
the
farm
and
a
jolly
supper
waiting
then
a
tree
that
night
and
christmas
next
day
with
coasting
and
skating
and
snowballing
if
the
weather
is
right
you
artful
child
exclaimed
jane
it
would
do
us
all
heaps
of
good
especially
father
and
mother
father
looks
to
me
so
worn
and
tired
have
you
noticed
it
shirley
nodded
she
had
indeed
noticed
it
and
a
plot
having
for
its
beneficiary
joseph
bell
was
at
the
back
of
the
planning
but
she
did
not
intend
that
anybody
should
find
that
out
so
she
agreed
lightly
that
jane
s
father
needed
a
holiday
as
did
all
the
others
if
we
can
t
get
any
of
them
to
take
more
than
christmas
day
we
can
at
least
bring
them
out
there
every
night
and
back
every
morning
she
said
we
ll
give
them
such
good
things
to
eat
they
won
t
mind
the
drive
with
grandfather
bell
s
big
horses
all
jingly
with
they
certainly
won
t
oh
will
you
go
and
speak
to
cook
now
i
simply
can
t
wait
to
get
things
under
way
do
you
mean
to
surprise
grandmother
bell
too
yes
if
your
grandfather
agrees
as
i
m
sure
he
will
if
we
told
her
she
d
tire
herself
all
out
doing
wholly
unnecessary
things
everything
in
the
house
is
always
in
order
but
she
would
n
t
think
so
you
re
quite
right
i
think
i
ll
go
and
talk
with
cook
and
jane
hurried
away
looking
as
girlishly
eager
as
shirley
herself
she
had
small
doubt
of
cook
if
murray
townsend
had
a
friend
in
the
house
it
was
bridget
harrison
townsend
had
never
considered
bridget
a
particularly
amiable
person
but
jane
had
won
her
completely
by
treating
her
always
with
consideration
and
by
showing
the
interest
in
her
affairs
which
is
appreciated
most
by
those
who
expect
it
least
sure
then
we
ll
go
murray
and
take
it
as
a
holiday
agreed
cook
when
her
young
mistress
had
explained
her
plans
and
we
ll
take
some
of
the
fixings
with
us
they
ll
not
be
havin
at
the
farm
during
the
week
that
intervened
before
christmas
shirley
s
head
was
so
full
of
her
schemes
that
for
the
first
time
since
her
initiation
into
office
work
she
had
considerable
difficulty
in
keeping
her
mind
upon
her
tasks
christmas
fell
upon
a
tuesday
that
year
fortunately
for
her
plans
so
after
saturday
noon
she
was
free
to
give
her
mind
to
the
pleasures
in
prospect
bell
and
nancy
had
agreed
enthusiastically
to
every
detail
of
the
arrangements
and
grandfather
bell
when
cautiously
consulted
over
the
telephone
and
urged
to
keep
it
all
a
secret
from
his
wife
had
responded
as
joyously
as
a
boy
that
the
party
might
occupy
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
house
and
have
things
all
their
own
way
if
they
would
only
come
it
proved
necessary
to
let
somebody
into
the
plan
at
the
last
in
order
that
the
men
returning
to
their
homes
on
monday
evening
should
be
directed
what
to
do
rufus
was
selected
for
this
office
an
appointment
which
tickled
him
so
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
kept
from
bursting
out
with
his
secret
at
night
he
was
first
at
home
and
as
the
others
one
by
one
arrived
he
haled
them
to
their
rooms
bade
them
make
themselves
ready
in
short
order
and
surreptitiously
packed
away
several
travelling
bags
in
the
recesses
of
grandfather
bell
s
capacious
now
on
runners
and
fitted
with
seats
what
on
earth
does
it
all
mean
asked
murray
taking
his
seat
in
the
sleigh
in
which
the
energetic
rufus
had
stowed
the
male
members
of
his
own
family
amidst
a
storm
of
questions
and
surmises
accompanied
by
much
good
humoured
raillery
at
his
own
quite
evident
excitement
it
means
that
you
re
kidnapped
and
may
never
see
home
again
responded
rufus
tucking
a
hot
soapstone
under
his
father
s
feet
for
the
night
was
sharp
and
shirley
s
orders
imperative
warm
daddy
want
an
extra
rug
over
you
i
ve
enough
here
to
wrap
up
a
party
of
elephants
i
m
very
comfortable
bell
replied
his
shoulder
rested
against
peter
s
and
peter
s
arm
lay
along
the
low
back
of
the
seat
behind
him
bell
always
felt
a
comfortable
sense
of
support
and
protection
when
peter
was
near
and
peter
generally
was
near
in
these
days
the
elder
man
well
understood
why
and
appreciated
the
devotion
which
showed
itself
in
acts
rather
than
in
words
i
ve
only
one
objection
to
make
declared
ross
as
the
sleigh
moved
briskly
off
driven
by
grandfather
bell
s
next
neighbour
a
man
who
did
odd
jobs
for
him
when
needed
and
worked
for
him
steadily
during
the
summers
i
m
hungry
as
a
bear
and
don
t
want
to
go
more
than
fifty
miles
to
supper
it
would
pay
you
to
go
a
hundred
judging
by
my
observations
asserted
rufus
from
among
the
fur
robes
at
ross
s
feet
and
we
ll
be
there
in
a
jiffy
don
t
these
boys
go
though
they
must
get
fed
plenty
of
oats
they
certainly
do
agreed
the
driver
elihu
bell
is
n
t
the
man
to
starve
his
horses
let
alone
humans
that
s
encouraging
and
murray
who
also
boasted
a
vigorous
appetite
fell
to
conjecturing
after
the
manner
of
hungry
man
what
supper
at
the
farm
would
be
like
he
knew
nothing
of
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
and
felt
rather
doubtful
whether
anything
could
take
the
place
of
the
dinner
of
jane
s
planning
he
had
expected
to
find
at
home
the
ten
miles
were
covered
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
for
the
sleighing
was
good
and
the
driver
anxious
to
show
what
his
horses
could
do
as
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
drew
up
at
the
side
porch
they
saw
that
the
old
house
was
aglow
from
top
to
bottom
with
lights
in
every
window
at
the
jingle
of
their
bells
the
door
flew
hospitably
open
although
no
one
was
in
sight
and
only
the
roaring
fire
in
the
wide
fireplace
opposite
the
door
seemed
on
hand
to
give
them
a
welcome
it
looks
enough
in
there
does
n
t
it
said
ross
catching
sight
of
holly
branches
and
ropes
of
adorning
the
and
holly
wreaths
tied
with
scarlet
ribbons
in
the
windows
well
well
ejaculated
joseph
bell
slowly
as
peter
gently
pushed
him
ahead
into
the
room
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
tree
its
top
touching
the
low
ceiling
its
branches
twinkling
with
candles
and
loaded
with
packages
he
blinked
with
astonishment
and
sat
abruptly
down
in
the
first
chair
that
offered
looking
as
pleased
as
a
boy
where
are
they
all
and
rufus
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
gave
a
ringing
hail
merry
christmas
responded
a
chorus
of
gay
voices
and
a
curtain
fell
aside
grandmother
bell
her
rosy
old
face
beaming
advanced
with
outstretched
hand
her
husband
close
behind
her
in
the
background
appeared
joseph
bell
jane
shirley
and
nancy
all
in
white
dresses
with
holly
berries
gleaming
in
their
hair
this
is
the
best
surprise
ever
heard
of
cried
peter
stooping
to
kiss
grandmother
bell
s
soft
wrinkled
cheek
and
then
turning
to
wring
his
grandfather
s
hand
this
beats
christmas
in
town
all
to
nothing
it
jolly
and
murray
saluted
the
old
lady
in
his
turn
for
he
was
a
favourite
with
her
not
only
because
he
was
jane
s
husband
but
because
from
the
first
he
had
taken
pains
to
be
very
good
to
her
he
smiled
at
jane
as
he
stood
straight
again
thinking
she
had
never
looked
prettier
than
she
did
but
murray
was
apt
to
think
that
wherever
he
first
caught
sight
of
her
after
a
day
s
absence
i
ve
been
trying
all
day
said
ross
as
he
greeted
the
old
people
to
make
myself
realise
this
was
christmas
eve
but
from
this
hour
all
difficulty
leaves
me
i
smell
christmas
in
the
air
it
s
the
pumpkin
pies
and
mince
and
doughnuts
and
plum
pudding
you
smell
laughed
nancy
the
greens
smell
sweet
and
too
said
shirley
we
had
such
fun
gathering
them
this
morning
it
seemed
a
pity
to
do
it
by
ourselves
if
i
d
known
of
it
i
should
have
blown
out
through
the
factory
roof
and
landed
over
in
grandfather
s
woods
declared
peter
coming
up
to
shake
hands
woods
in
winter
and
s
a
holiday
are
we
to
stay
i
thought
i
fell
over
a
grip
as
i
got
out
of
the
sleigh
indeed
you
are
for
four
days
four
days
i
only
wish
i
could
you
can
evenings
and
nights
and
mornings
do
you
mean
it
are
we
invited
we
are
who
thought
this
magnificent
scheme
up
demanded
peter
ah
you
re
blushing
i
might
have
i
ve
been
out
in
the
cold
air
more
than
half
the
day
and
shirley
covered
one
brilliant
cheek
with
her
hand
are
n
t
you
hungry
famishing
we
re
to
have
supper
right
away
your
grandmother
calls
it
supper
and
cook
calls
it
dinner
cook
she
s
here
well
of
all
the
but
peter
had
to
be
hurried
away
by
his
sister
nancy
to
his
room
his
old
room
upstairs
under
the
eaves
where
he
found
his
awaiting
him
and
a
brisk
fire
snapping
in
the
old
box
stove
for
the
time
being
he
felt
he
could
let
himself
forget
that
the
old
roof
was
encumbered
by
a
heavy
mortgage
due
in
six
weeks
now
and
held
by
a
man
who
had
long
coveted
that
farm
it
was
christmas
the
meal
spread
in
the
long
low
to
which
a
merry
company
presently
sat
down
was
a
delicious
one
grandmother
bell
s
old
canton
plates
and
cups
had
never
been
more
delectably
filled
nor
had
her
antique
silver
forks
and
spoons
clinked
to
a
livelier
measure
than
the
talk
and
laughter
which
went
round
as
the
supper
proceeded
does
it
seem
like
home
here
shirley
asked
joseph
bell
home
said
he
with
a
glance
from
the
old
prints
upon
the
walls
to
the
antique
side
table
below
with
its
leaf
it
s
the
only
place
in
the
world
that
will
ever
really
seem
like
home
to
me
it
s
just
a
makeshift
living
in
the
city
to
people
who
were
brought
up
on
a
place
like
this
you
see
though
i
went
away
from
here
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
lived
a
long
time
in
the
city
working
up
in
the
paper
factory
we
came
back
here
again
and
stayed
five
years
while
the
children
were
little
on
account
of
a
breakdown
in
my
health
then
when
i
grew
strong
again
we
moved
back
and
settled
in
gay
street
but
the
farm
is
home
always
will
be
my
wife
feels
the
same
way
though
she
was
a
city
girl
she
d
like
to
live
here
now
as
much
as
ever
i
don
t
wonder
it
s
one
of
the
pleasantest
i
ever
saw
and
shirley
smiled
across
the
table
at
peter
as
she
spoke
meeting
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
from
his
father
s
face
to
hers
well
pleased
to
see
the
elder
man
looking
as
if
heartily
enjoying
himself
the
tree
is
only
to
look
at
this
evening
announced
jane
when
they
were
all
back
in
the
nothing
is
to
be
taken
off
it
till
evening
and
we
re
to
be
tantalised
all
that
while
i
m
willing
to
see
it
shorn
of
its
fruit
any
time
after
i
ve
made
a
quick
trip
to
town
which
will
be
the
first
thing
morning
said
murray
with
a
meaning
wink
at
peter
who
nodded
comprehending
rufus
grinned
at
his
father
and
a
general
spirit
of
understanding
appeared
to
prevail
among
the
guests
who
had
been
brought
away
to
the
party
without
a
chance
to
get
together
the
parcels
they
had
stowed
in
sundry
secret
places
we
re
glad
you
re
so
clever
at
seeing
our
reasons
for
delay
said
nancy
gazing
up
into
the
thick
branches
of
the
tree
her
eye
upon
various
packages
of
her
own
all
tied
in
the
same
way
so
that
they
were
easily
recognisable
she
had
worked
for
months
over
her
gifts
having
little
money
to
spend
but
possessing
much
love
and
ten
skilful
fingers
meanwhile
we
must
have
something
doing
this
evening
said
rufus
what
shall
it
be
how
will
making
candy
suit
your
zest
for
sport
asked
jane
bully
we
haven
t
made
candy
since
we
grew
up
not
real
candy
i
don
t
count
nan
s
caramels
and
shirley
s
fudge
let
s
make
some
real
molasses
candy
and
it
what
else
at
the
old
farm
as
soon
as
the
kitchen
is
clear
we
ll
go
out
and
jane
disappeared
to
hasten
operations
in
the
kitchen
by
tying
on
an
apron
and
wiping
dishes
herself
with
norah
her
blithe
talk
while
her
fingers
flew
kept
both
cook
and
norah
smiling
while
they
worked
and
the
big
kitchen
was
soon
in
spotless
order
it
does
be
after
doin
me
good
to
work
in
a
place
like
this
again
declared
cook
as
she
helped
jane
measure
out
molasses
and
get
the
big
kettle
on
it
s
not
that
i
don
t
like
the
tiles
and
the
copper
and
all
the
conveniences
of
my
kitchen
in
the
city
but
when
a
person
has
been
brought
up
in
the
country
there
s
always
the
fondness
clingin
to
them
for
the
old
ways
even
if
they
re
a
bit
inconvenient
see
the
gourd
dipper
now
norah
will
you
say
that
water
does
n
t
taste
better
out
of
it
than
from
granite
ware
i
never
saw
a
dipper
like
this
before
answered
norah
who
had
been
born
in
town
and
could
hardly
share
cook
s
enthusiasm
for
these
details
of
country
living
knows
what
i
mean
said
cook
with
a
nod
of
the
head
after
her
young
mistress
just
departing
sure
i
have
n
t
seen
such
a
sparkle
in
the
eyes
of
her
since
she
came
to
live
at
the
house
she
s
not
born
to
be
a
great
lady
just
a
one
and
that
s
the
best
sort
to
my
mind
then
she
beckoned
norah
away
and
they
fled
up
the
back
stairs
just
as
the
sounds
of
approaching
feet
warned
them
that
the
company
were
coming
jolly
this
is
the
stuff
exulted
rufus
bursting
first
into
the
kitchen
doesn
t
that
smell
like
the
real
thing
tie
an
apron
on
me
and
let
me
take
charge
of
the
kettle
the
rest
of
you
can
grease
tins
i
ll
offer
a
prize
for
the
whitest
candy
secure
your
partners
for
the
pulling
may
i
have
the
honour
and
peter
made
his
best
bow
to
shirley
as
she
appeared
from
the
pantry
her
hands
full
of
shining
tins
of
course
you
may
if
you
ll
show
me
how
i
never
pulled
candy
in
my
life
your
education
has
been
appallingly
insufficient
in
spite
of
those
two
years
in
england
but
i
used
to
be
pretty
good
at
it
and
we
ll
take
the
prize
if
you
follow
directions
please
begin
by
taking
off
those
rings
commanded
peter
shirley
obediently
slipped
off
several
pretty
rings
then
she
tied
on
a
small
and
frivolous
apron
at
which
peter
frowned
do
you
call
that
absurdity
of
lace
and
ribbons
an
apron
he
demanded
what
do
you
suppose
will
happen
to
it
if
you
drop
a
hunk
of
candy
in
the
sticky
stage
on
it
here
i
ll
get
you
one
of
grandma
s
they
re
worth
something
shirley
presently
found
herself
invested
in
a
bountifully
made
apron
of
checked
white
material
with
a
bib
and
strings
which
nearly
covered
her
from
sight
now
you
re
safe
and
so
is
the
candy
the
minute
it
s
fairly
cool
we
ll
seize
a
generous
portion
and
get
away
to
some
cool
spot
with
it
it
was
some
time
before
this
stage
in
the
operations
was
reached
and
meanwhile
peter
found
himself
obliged
to
share
his
partner
with
ross
and
rufus
who
had
no
idea
of
allowing
monopolies
with
no
other
girls
present
but
nancy
the
elder
people
however
proved
themselves
nearly
as
good
company
as
the
younger
ones
for
everybody
seemed
to
have
adopted
the
spirit
of
the
season
and
to
be
ready
for
as
much
as
possible
and
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
both
peter
and
shirley
not
the
least
of
the
company
seemed
joseph
bell
himself
to
peter
especially
watching
his
father
with
an
eye
which
took
note
as
the
others
could
not
the
very
evident
relaxation
and
refreshment
of
the
occasion
were
a
source
of
deep
satisfaction
for
once
the
son
felt
that
he
could
himself
relax
and
dare
to
get
out
of
the
hour
all
the
joy
there
was
in
it
happiness
of
this
sort
could
not
hurt
he
was
sure
it
could
only
help
our
panful
is
cool
enough
declared
peter
flourishing
the
gingham
apron
which
veiled
his
long
legs
as
he
returned
from
the
porch
where
the
candy
had
been
cooling
now
partner
hands
buttered
courage
good
stand
ready
to
take
hold
when
i
say
the
word
i
ll
work
the
lump
into
malleable
condition
open
the
door
into
the
please
we
ll
do
our
pulling
there
if
it
s
not
too
cool
for
you
then
we
ll
not
get
stuck
shirley
gave
a
little
shriek
as
peter
presently
with
a
deft
pull
of
his
big
lump
into
a
long
smooth
skein
handed
her
one
end
with
the
injunction
to
draw
it
out
quickly
and
swing
it
back
to
him
but
it
s
hot
of
course
it
is
miss
if
we
let
it
get
comfortably
cool
we
could
n
t
pull
it
at
all
keep
hold
keep
it
moving
don
t
let
it
stay
in
your
fingers
long
enough
to
stick
pull
swing
pull
swing
hold
on
you
re
getting
stuck
wait
a
minute
i
can
t
do
anything
but
wait
gasped
shirley
holding
up
ten
fingers
hopelessly
embedded
in
a
mass
of
uncomfortably
warm
material
what
can
this
be
the
expert
stenographer
all
balled
up
in
a
couple
of
quarts
of
molasses
hold
still
don
t
try
to
work
out
i
ll
pull
you
loose
don
t
let
the
others
see
keep
away
from
that
kitchen
door
but
rufus
pulling
smoothly
away
from
jane
with
the
art
acquired
by
much
practice
in
past
years
spied
out
the
tangled
ones
his
shout
of
laughter
brought
all
the
others
toward
the
door
shirley
and
peter
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
kitchen
to
obtain
butter
for
the
fingers
they
fell
into
a
state
of
great
merriment
over
the
situation
in
which
everybody
else
joined
appreciatively
and
the
old
kitchen
rafters
rang
with
the
laughter
where
would
the
stage
apron
be
now
this
is
no
gallery
play
jeered
peter
rescuing
one
long
string
of
sweetness
from
the
front
of
shirley
s
big
white
apron
want
a
taste
shut
your
eyes
and
open
your
mouth
no
thank
you
eat
it
yourself
i
will
and
peter
tipped
back
his
head
at
this
interesting
moment
the
door
between
and
kitchen
swung
open
a
figure
appeared
upon
the
threshold
a
figure
clad
in
silk
and
furs
topped
by
a
parisian
bonnet
over
its
shoulder
showed
the
heads
of
two
others
one
wearing
a
wonderful
hat
covered
with
fine
black
the
other
its
own
thin
thatch
of
short
hair
we
have
found
you
at
last
said
the
voice
of
harrison
townsend
behind
her
olive
burst
into
a
musical
peal
of
laughter
look
at
shirley
mother
don
t
you
think
it
s
about
time
we
came
home
to
prevent
her
quite
returning
to
childhood
then
harrison
townsend
from
the
background
this
is
rather
stealing
a
march
on
you
good
friends
but
we
found
our
own
house
dark
and
this
is
christmas
eve
chapter
viii
peter
reads
rhymes
stay
of
course
you
ll
stay
declared
grandfather
bell
to
and
townsend
it
ll
do
you
good
after
all
your
junketing
and
we
ll
be
mightily
pleased
to
have
you
it
had
not
taken
much
persuasion
there
certainly
was
a
charm
pervading
the
old
farmhouse
and
the
thought
of
resting
quietly
there
for
a
few
days
appealed
to
townsend
her
husband
was
delighted
at
the
plan
for
he
had
been
persuaded
to
join
his
wife
abroad
and
several
months
of
european
travel
had
wearied
him
everything
simple
and
homelike
attracted
him
now
more
than
ever
it
had
been
his
restlessness
which
had
brought
his
party
home
a
month
before
the
date
originally
set
for
their
return
if
there
had
been
a
goodly
number
of
packages
upon
the
christmas
tree
on
christmas
eve
there
were
more
than
double
that
number
by
the
evening
of
christmas
day
not
only
had
murray
and
peter
made
an
excursion
to
town
but
townsend
mindful
of
many
intended
gifts
stored
away
in
her
trunks
had
sent
olive
in
with
the
others
to
get
them
when
the
christmas
dinner
was
over
rufus
proposed
that
the
clan
go
out
for
an
hour
s
skating
on
a
pond
not
far
away
we
can
enjoy
that
tree
a
lot
better
if
we
have
some
good
brisk
exercise
beforehand
he
asserted
i
don
t
skate
said
olive
looking
as
if
she
wished
she
did
come
along
with
us
just
the
same
urged
ross
and
we
ll
take
turns
not
exactly
sitting
out
with
you
but
walking
up
and
down
the
shore
or
we
ll
teach
you
olive
declined
to
be
taught
but
agreed
to
accompany
the
others
promenading
along
the
bank
her
dark
beauty
made
brilliant
by
the
frosty
air
which
nipped
her
cheeks
she
was
a
figure
to
compel
attention
she
had
never
seemed
more
companionable
than
now
and
both
ross
and
rufus
enjoyed
with
more
zest
than
they
had
anticipated
the
period
allotted
to
them
for
bearing
her
company
murray
observing
her
with
brotherly
penetration
found
her
decidedly
improved
and
wondered
what
had
happened
during
the
months
of
her
absence
to
make
her
so
much
more
appreciative
of
her
family
s
society
than
she
had
been
wont
to
be
when
peter
in
his
turn
came
to
offer
himself
as
partner
in
her
exile
from
the
gaieties
going
on
upon
the
ice
she
greeted
him
with
a
smile
so
radiant
that
he
looked
at
her
in
wonder
the
old
friendship
between
the
two
begun
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
acquaintance
and
carried
on
through
several
years
while
they
grew
from
boy
and
girl
to
man
and
woman
had
waned
and
nearly
died
of
neglect
on
both
sides
during
the
past
two
years
each
had
become
absorbed
in
pursuits
so
different
that
they
had
little
in
common
and
olive
especially
had
seemed
to
outgrow
the
traits
of
frankness
and
friendliness
which
had
made
peter
like
her
in
spite
of
many
obvious
faults
before
she
went
away
he
had
come
to
think
of
her
as
hopelessly
spoiled
and
artificial
but
now
had
something
changed
her
point
of
view
a
few
years
ago
said
olive
as
the
two
paced
up
and
down
exchanging
comments
on
the
occurrences
of
the
past
months
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
grown
up
when
i
look
at
jane
and
shirley
and
nancy
after
having
been
away
from
them
for
six
months
i
realise
that
their
genius
for
remaining
girls
is
going
to
be
an
advantage
what
a
trio
they
are
shouldn
t
you
say
they
were
all
three
about
sixteen
the
three
had
just
joined
hands
and
skated
away
from
murray
ross
and
rufus
who
had
promptly
started
in
pursuit
all
three
wore
skirts
of
ankle
length
short
jackets
and
close
little
caps
and
none
had
considered
furs
a
necessary
article
of
apparel
for
lively
exercise
a
blue
silk
scarf
about
jane
s
throat
and
a
scarlet
one
floating
to
the
breeze
from
shirley
s
furnished
notes
of
colour
to
the
agile
figures
and
three
winsome
faces
looked
up
at
the
two
on
the
bank
with
a
gay
greeting
as
the
trio
swung
lightly
by
i
certainly
should
agreed
peter
i
don
t
think
jane
will
ever
grow
old
nan
is
an
infant
and
will
be
for
ten
years
yet
as
far
as
settling
down
to
consider
herself
too
old
for
pranks
like
that
and
i
m
glad
of
it
as
for
your
sister
shirley
tell
me
what
you
think
of
shirley
the
child
is
a
continual
puzzle
to
me
i
can
t
make
her
out
this
idea
of
working
steadily
at
earning
a
salary
in
the
office
seems
to
be
a
fixed
one
though
i
had
supposed
it
only
a
freak
does
she
look
as
contented
as
this
all
the
time
or
is
it
just
the
relaxation
of
the
holiday
i
should
say
it
was
a
permanent
condition
of
mind
she
s
more
interested
in
her
work
than
when
she
began
and
is
growing
surprisingly
expert
murray
told
me
yesterday
she
wants
to
tackle
the
special
foreign
correspondence
french
you
know
that
means
a
lot
of
extra
labour
peter
spoke
as
if
he
felt
a
personal
pride
in
shirley
s
achievements
an
attitude
which
shirley
s
sister
was
quick
to
note
i
felt
out
of
patience
with
you
when
she
began
for
i
thought
her
zeal
for
making
a
of
herself
might
be
of
your
inspiring
said
olive
with
a
quick
look
at
him
not
a
bit
of
it
i
never
heard
of
it
till
she
had
been
a
week
at
her
first
studies
how
should
i
have
dared
suggest
such
a
course
you
and
she
seem
to
be
great
friends
do
we
it
is
an
honour
i
appreciate
very
much
answered
peter
with
a
little
touch
of
courtliness
in
his
manner
such
as
had
often
surprised
her
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
and
which
struck
her
now
as
decidedly
interesting
in
a
young
man
who
spent
his
days
in
a
factory
even
if
he
was
many
degrees
higher
in
position
in
that
factory
than
when
she
had
first
known
him
what
his
position
was
at
present
she
did
not
guess
nor
did
she
know
that
murray
had
begun
to
look
at
him
as
a
man
to
be
desired
in
his
own
business
a
man
whose
brain
was
undoubtedly
to
make
him
an
important
factor
wherever
he
might
be
what
she
did
recognise
was
that
she
had
met
few
men
anywhere
who
had
the
power
to
command
her
interest
as
peter
had
always
done
and
seemed
now
more
capable
of
doing
than
ever
before
as
for
his
looks
she
owned
to
herself
that
she
had
never
before
realised
quite
how
fine
and
resolute
and
altogether
manly
was
his
whole
personality
speaking
of
contentment
said
peter
breaking
the
little
silence
which
had
followed
upon
his
last
words
don
t
you
think
it
follows
rather
naturally
upon
feeling
that
you
are
accomplishing
something
worth
the
doing
it
does
n
t
make
so
much
difference
what
it
is
the
point
is
that
you
re
doing
it
if
it
costs
effort
so
much
the
better
it
depends
on
what
you
think
is
worth
the
doing
said
olive
you
and
i
would
be
apt
to
differ
on
that
as
shirley
and
i
do
not
much
question
of
that
admitted
peter
smiling
he
gave
her
one
of
his
glances
under
which
she
shrank
a
little
though
she
did
not
show
it
it
made
her
say
rather
defiantly
of
course
you
think
as
you
always
did
that
i
m
the
most
useless
creature
living
and
that
my
ideals
are
about
as
insignificant
as
the
amount
of
actual
work
i
do
their
eyes
met
hers
black
and
sparkling
his
gray
and
steady
and
cool
he
studied
her
for
an
instant
with
a
quality
in
his
intent
scrutiny
before
which
her
eyes
went
down
she
was
used
to
admiration
in
men
s
observation
of
her
and
though
that
element
could
hardly
be
lacking
in
peter
s
since
he
was
human
and
she
a
more
than
ordinarily
charming
young
woman
there
was
also
in
his
regard
that
appearance
of
taking
her
measure
which
quite
unconsciously
he
could
never
help
exercising
when
brought
into
contact
with
men
or
women
but
his
words
when
they
came
were
gentle
if
you
don
t
mind
my
saying
so
i
think
you
re
capable
of
things
so
well
worth
while
that
your
life
might
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
you
you
could
if
you
cared
to
do
what
you
pleased
with
almost
anybody
you
have
the
art
the
magnetism
whatever
it
may
be
of
the
born
leader
the
only
trouble
is
you
don
t
much
mind
do
you
which
way
you
lead
this
from
peter
bell
for
a
minute
olive
was
left
speechless
yet
it
was
impossible
to
resent
his
frank
putting
of
the
case
for
it
conveyed
something
which
gave
her
a
distinct
pleasure
i
m
not
sure
whether
i
ought
to
be
angry
with
you
or
not
she
said
after
a
minute
please
don
t
be
when
did
you
take
up
the
profession
of
preacher
to
the
queen
suggested
peter
with
an
odd
smile
but
you
re
at
liberty
to
order
my
head
off
at
any
minute
you
know
or
to
preach
back
which
would
be
worse
in
spite
of
this
they
were
both
laughing
when
the
others
came
up
with
the
announcement
that
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
the
house
but
peter
s
keen
speech
sank
in
olive
did
not
forget
it
soon
and
somehow
she
was
more
than
ever
sure
that
peter
himself
was
well
worth
cultivating
i
never
was
so
excited
over
a
christmas
tree
as
over
this
one
confided
nancy
to
shirley
as
the
two
dressed
for
the
evening
the
christmas
dinner
had
taken
place
after
the
country
fashion
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
it
was
now
six
o
clock
and
the
evening
was
before
them
no
supper
was
in
order
after
the
tremendous
banquet
at
three
o
clock
but
jane
had
provided
certain
light
refreshments
of
the
decorative
sort
salad
and
sandwiches
ices
and
bonbons
cakes
and
a
great
bowl
of
fruit
punch
all
of
which
waited
in
a
cool
spot
ready
for
the
serving
by
the
young
people
themselves
cook
and
norah
had
been
sent
into
town
for
a
celebration
of
their
own
with
friends
oh
oh
what
a
pretty
frock
cried
nancy
as
her
friend
shook
out
a
soft
silken
fabric
of
pale
gray
lighted
up
here
and
there
with
small
sprigs
of
scarlet
flowers
with
belt
and
long
streamers
of
scarlet
velvet
to
match
do
you
like
it
it
s
my
one
french
gown
and
an
inexpensive
one
too
but
it
looks
festal
and
i
thought
i
d
christen
it
will
you
wear
the
one
i
have
for
you
i
meant
to
put
it
on
the
tree
but
it
occurred
to
me
you
might
like
to
wear
it
and
keep
me
company
and
shirley
pulled
a
long
box
from
under
the
valance
of
the
high
bed
you
are
the
dearest
thing
that
ever
lived
cried
nancy
going
down
on
her
knees
before
the
box
and
lifting
out
the
frock
of
pale
blue
veiling
with
its
trimmings
of
flowered
ribbon
a
girlish
creation
of
the
sort
to
please
young
eyes
it
was
a
very
happy
pair
of
maids
who
descended
the
staircase
together
they
were
happy
however
in
two
quite
different
ways
nancy
s
cup
was
overflowing
in
the
delight
of
her
pretty
finery
but
it
was
a
joy
of
another
sort
which
made
shirley
s
heart
beat
high
under
the
folds
of
gray
with
the
scarlet
flowers
a
small
envelope
lay
hidden
over
the
contents
of
which
the
girl
had
spent
an
anxious
hour
there
has
not
been
room
to
tell
of
it
in
this
brief
chronicle
but
for
the
last
month
shirley
had
been
having
consultations
with
murray
over
an
important
subject
the
matter
of
an
investment
she
wished
to
make
she
owned
not
a
small
amount
of
property
in
stocks
and
bonds
an
inheritance
from
her
grandfather
the
management
of
which
had
been
put
into
her
hands
by
her
father
as
a
matter
of
education
within
a
few
weeks
a
chance
for
profitable
investment
of
a
portion
of
this
holding
had
appealed
to
her
and
after
a
spirited
argument
with
her
brother
she
had
received
his
sanction
in
the
course
she
was
eager
to
adopt
the
legal
part
of
the
transaction
had
been
completed
two
days
before
christmas
and
since
then
shirley
had
been
greatly
occupied
in
spare
moments
with
the
composition
of
something
which
might
seem
to
have
small
connection
with
so
prosaic
a
subject
as
the
transfer
of
certain
legal
documents
from
one
pair
of
hands
to
another
she
was
not
yet
satisfied
with
the
result
of
her
endeavours
being
no
poet
but
the
best
burlesque
production
of
which
she
had
been
capable
had
been
carefully
copied
on
her
typewriter
and
was
now
reposing
where
its
presence
considerably
quickened
the
under
the
scarlet
flowers
at
a
moment
when
she
was
alone
in
the
room
shirley
slipped
round
behind
the
tree
and
extracting
the
envelope
from
its
agitating
position
quickly
although
with
fingers
which
mixed
themselves
up
a
little
tied
it
in
an
obscure
place
beneath
a
bough
where
a
gay
golden
ball
nearly
hid
it
from
view
come
out
come
out
commanded
rufus
as
arriving
upon
the
scene
he
spied
her
absolutely
not
a
feather
s
weight
more
allowed
on
that
tree
there
never
was
a
tree
so
bowed
down
with
care
as
that
one
nor
another
small
boy
so
impatient
to
begin
as
this
one
i
caught
sight
of
my
name
on
that
package
six
feet
long
under
there
and
i
ve
been
delirious
with
suspense
ever
since
as
soon
as
santa
claus
arrives
promised
jane
who
had
agreed
with
shirley
that
no
accompaniment
of
the
traditional
christmas
should
be
lacking
although
there
were
no
small
children
present
to
be
edified
by
the
sight
of
the
patron
saint
older
people
as
she
well
knew
frequently
enjoy
a
return
to
childish
means
of
entertainment
and
when
santa
claus
in
full
rig
walked
into
the
room
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
looks
of
greatest
pleasure
upon
the
faces
of
grandfather
and
grandmother
bell
peter
made
a
capital
santa
claus
treating
them
all
as
children
and
making
speeches
as
he
presented
the
gifts
which
brought
forth
peals
of
merriment
the
gifts
themselves
were
many
and
varied
from
the
mittens
knit
by
grandmother
bell
s
skilful
fingers
to
the
silken
scarfs
and
fans
and
foreign
photographs
which
were
the
contributions
of
the
travelled
townsends
skees
cried
rufus
going
into
contortions
of
ecstasy
over
murray
s
present
and
clumping
up
and
down
the
room
on
the
unwieldy
articles
won
t
i
get
out
night
on
that
hill
back
of
the
pond
such
beautiful
lace
i
never
saw
said
joseph
bell
to
townsend
her
fingers
caressing
the
exquisite
tracery
of
the
pattern
lying
in
her
lap
which
had
come
to
her
with
the
love
of
eleanor
forrest
townsend
i
thought
it
looked
like
you
returned
townsend
who
was
looking
very
much
pleased
herself
over
a
handkerchief
wrought
by
nancy
s
clever
art
the
others
were
busy
over
their
gifts
it
was
a
pandemonium
of
exclamations
and
congratulations
expressions
of
gratitude
and
observations
of
wonder
and
delight
shirley
her
lap
full
of
parcels
ribbons
and
cards
of
presentation
talking
and
exclaiming
with
the
rest
was
yet
keeping
her
eye
on
santa
claus
as
he
stripped
the
tree
she
was
watching
for
the
moment
when
he
should
find
that
envelope
when
it
came
she
meant
to
be
out
of
the
room
and
away
meanwhile
santa
claus
dropped
a
fresh
package
into
her
lap
she
recognised
the
saint
s
own
handwriting
on
the
wrapper
a
bolder
firmer
hand
than
one
would
have
expected
from
a
gentleman
with
so
long
and
snowy
a
beard
she
opened
it
with
strong
anticipation
and
found
within
a
set
of
of
special
style
and
quality
evidently
made
to
order
for
the
binding
was
of
a
beautiful
texture
of
leather
and
the
paper
within
of
the
best
known
to
trade
the
thin
india
used
only
for
fine
work
her
name
delicately
stenciled
on
the
covers
completed
a
gift
which
appealed
to
the
girl
with
a
sense
of
the
thought
and
care
put
into
its
she
looked
up
to
find
santa
claus
s
eyes
watching
her
from
behind
the
tree
his
lips
smiling
beneath
the
white
beard
for
her
surprise
and
pleasure
were
plainly
to
be
read
upon
her
face
she
nodded
at
him
colouring
rosily
a
picture
in
her
gray
and
scarlet
frock
as
she
sat
upon
the
floor
surrounded
by
her
gifts
the
sight
of
which
was
quite
sufficient
to
reward
any
giver
almost
everything
was
off
the
tree
hello
here
s
something
i
nearly
missed
murmured
santa
claus
catching
sight
of
the
corner
of
the
white
envelope
beneath
the
golden
ball
shirley
looked
up
quickly
saw
him
struggling
with
the
red
ribbon
which
tied
the
envelope
in
place
and
rose
to
her
feet
letting
a
lapful
of
miscellaneous
articles
slide
to
the
floor
everybody
was
busy
and
only
bell
noticed
and
said
gently
look
out
dear
you
re
dropping
things
but
shirley
was
gone
through
the
crowd
of
people
and
packages
to
the
door
and
had
closed
it
softly
behind
her
peter
had
already
had
a
gift
from
shirley
a
little
thing
she
was
not
the
girl
to
present
any
man
with
a
keepsake
more
valuable
than
the
small
book
of
modern
verse
which
had
in
it
certain
stirring
lines
that
she
knew
would
be
a
stimulus
to
him
so
when
he
saw
his
own
name
in
typewriting
upon
the
envelope
he
opened
it
without
much
consideration
thinking
it
a
joke
of
ross
s
or
rufus
s
but
a
second
envelope
was
fitted
inside
the
first
and
it
was
labeled
please
don
t
read
this
in
public
his
curiosity
was
awakened
now
and
slipping
the
communication
into
his
pocket
he
summarily
finished
his
duties
by
distributing
the
few
remaining
parcels
without
comment
and
then
walked
away
out
of
the
room
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
that
was
of
a
sort
that
he
had
seen
once
or
twice
before
when
shirley
had
had
occasion
to
send
him
a
note
of
invitation
outside
in
the
hall
which
was
dimly
lighted
by
an
oil
screwed
to
the
wall
peter
opened
his
inner
envelope
still
in
typewritten
characters
was
a
set
of
rhymes
cast
in
a
popular
fashion
used
by
makers
of
humorous
doggerel
his
eye
ran
over
them
hurriedly
with
a
low
ejaculation
of
astonishment
and
incredulity
at
the
end
then
he
read
them
again
more
intently
looking
as
if
he
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
they
ran
thus
a
farm
owned
by
people
named
bell
was
a
place
where
a
thorn
would
fain
dwell
so
he
bought
up
a
mortgage
intending
to
war
wage
on
the
named
bell
now
one
of
the
bells
christened
peter
thought
life
would
be
fuller
and
sweeter
if
the
farm
could
be
shorn
of
this
thorn
for
he
feared
a
foreclosure
did
peter
a
designing
young
person
called
townsend
was
seeking
investment
cash
down
and
she
purchased
the
mortgage
she
never
will
war
wage
she
ll
never
foreclose
will
townsend
peter
had
noticed
if
nobody
else
had
when
shirley
went
out
of
the
room
he
now
understood
her
sudden
disappearance
he
made
a
quick
trip
through
the
lower
part
of
the
house
paper
in
hand
his
questioning
gaze
penetrating
every
corner
she
was
not
in
the
or
the
or
the
kitchen
at
least
he
thought
she
was
not
although
he
even
looked
into
the
as
he
was
returning
through
the
kitchen
an
expression
of
determination
on
his
face
not
wholly
obscured
by
his
patriarchal
beard
whose
hitherto
uncomfortable
presence
he
had
quite
forgotten
a
slight
movement
of
the
pantry
door
caught
his
eye
he
seized
the
it
would
not
turn
for
a
moment
then
it
slipped
slowly
round
for
his
fingers
were
stronger
than
hers
the
two
confronted
each
other
the
gentleman
with
the
figure
of
an
athlete
and
the
eyes
of
an
excited
youth
and
the
slim
girl
in
the
gray
silk
with
cheeks
like
her
scarlet
ribbons
what
does
this
mean
demanded
santa
claus
he
put
forth
one
vigorous
arm
and
drew
the
runaway
out
from
the
closet
by
her
resisting
hand
just
what
it
says
i
should
think
answered
shirley
bravely
although
trembling
had
she
offended
him
through
the
whole
transaction
that
had
been
the
one
burden
of
her
anxiety
it
doesn
t
say
it
very
clearly
but
she
never
tried
writing
limericks
before
they
re
not
so
easy
as
you
might
think
she
who
s
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ve
actually
bought
that
mortgage
murray
did
the
business
i
didn
t
see
mr
thorn
but
you
own
the
mortgage
yes
thorn
did
n
t
want
to
sell
it
no
but
he
had
to
take
payment
if
it
came
when
the
mortgage
matured
it
is
n
t
due
for
six
weeks
yet
he
did
n
t
mind
being
paid
sooner
when
he
found
all
hope
of
the
chance
of
foreclosing
was
gone
he
would
n
t
sell
for
the
face
of
it
i
m
not
familiar
with
business
terms
urged
shirley
not
a
girl
who
holds
a
position
with
townsend
company
tell
me
shirley
you
did
n
t
get
that
mortgage
six
weeks
before
it
was
due
for
the
face
value
of
it
not
quite
how
much
did
you
pay
not
more
than
it
was
worth
please
tell
me
much
you
paid
i
think
that
s
my
affair
said
shirley
with
her
head
up
but
her
eyes
were
down
there
was
a
silence
peter
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
with
intent
to
cover
a
sudden
urgent
and
unwonted
necessity
to
steady
his
lips
he
encountered
the
beard
tore
it
off
and
cast
the
wig
beside
it
upon
the
floor
a
young
man
with
a
face
of
mingled
light
and
shadow
emerged
from
the
disguise
of
the
elderly
one
if
i
didn
t
know
that
with
this
farm
as
security
you
d
made
a
safe
investment
i
could
n
t
stand
this
he
said
in
a
low
tone
but
i
know
that
making
a
safe
investment
was
the
last
thing
you
cared
about
you
wanted
to
stand
by
in
a
time
of
need
and
you
ve
done
it
you
mustn
t
think
said
shirley
looking
up
eagerly
that
you
re
under
the
least
obligation
to
me
it
s
just
as
you
say
the
farm
itself
is
more
than
security
it
s
merely
a
matter
of
business
you
know
i
m
learning
to
manage
my
little
affairs
father
thought
it
would
be
good
for
me
and
a
change
of
investment
like
this
is
great
fun
peter
looked
at
her
steadily
oh
no
we
re
not
under
the
least
obligation
to
you
he
answered
it
s
very
easy
to
find
people
to
take
a
mortgage
at
terms
that
will
induce
a
man
to
sell
it
who
s
looking
for
a
chance
to
foreclose
that
s
why
i
have
n
t
done
any
worrying
about
the
matter
shirley
you
re
he
seized
her
hand
you
re
it
s
all
right
said
shirley
turning
her
head
away
with
a
sudden
access
of
shyness
there
was
no
knowing
what
terms
peter
might
be
going
to
use
when
his
voice
dropped
to
that
vibrating
note
but
she
did
not
escape
peter
was
ordinarily
a
young
man
with
a
cool
head
not
likely
to
be
carried
away
by
sudden
emotion
but
he
had
a
warm
heart
none
the
less
and
the
girl
s
friendly
act
had
touched
him
deeply
besides
he
was
as
has
been
admitted
before
entirely
human
and
shirley
in
her
gray
and
scarlet
with
her
brilliant
cheeks
and
drooping
eyes
was
a
very
captivating
figure
tightening
his
grasp
upon
her
hand
he
ended
his
impulsive
speech
half
under
his
breath
with
you
re
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
what
he
would
have
said
or
done
next
can
only
be
conjectured
for
upon
this
unexpected
and
most
disconcerting
demonstration
shirley
pulled
her
hand
away
and
ran
somewhere
anywhere
she
did
not
just
know
where
in
this
indefinite
region
she
remained
for
fully
half
an
hour
in
the
end
she
had
to
come
back
to
the
but
when
she
did
it
was
not
to
look
at
peter
as
for
peter
himself
when
he
had
got
rid
of
his
santa
claus
costume
and
put
himself
in
order
again
he
also
came
back
to
the
his
face
had
been
put
in
order
as
well
as
his
dress
and
nobody
noticed
anything
odd
about
him
but
there
something
odd
about
him
very
odd
he
felt
like
a
railway
locomotive
off
the
track
obliged
to
convey
to
the
beholders
by
its
steadiness
of
gait
the
impression
that
it
was
still
on
chapter
ix
a
red
glare
by
all
that
s
astonishing
are
you
actually
idling
and
may
i
come
and
idle
too
shirley
looked
up
from
the
depths
of
one
of
the
capacious
willow
chairs
which
well
stocked
with
cushions
were
favourite
upon
the
great
side
porch
of
the
townsend
house
and
from
which
one
could
look
out
over
a
long
and
charming
stretch
of
lawn
toward
the
it
was
a
warm
evening
in
late
may
everybody
else
was
away
and
shirley
had
settled
herself
for
one
of
the
rare
hours
of
rest
and
solitude
which
she
so
much
enjoyed
when
her
work
was
done
but
she
answered
brant
hille
cordially
of
course
you
may
if
you
will
be
nice
and
soothing
these
first
warm
days
make
me
feel
a
trifle
lazy
not
strange
when
you
spend
them
in
a
stuffy
office
brant
accepted
the
cushions
she
tossed
to
him
and
disposed
himself
comfortably
upon
them
on
the
top
step
near
her
feet
the
office
is
n
t
stuffy
i
ve
sat
by
a
window
all
day
besides
the
first
thing
murray
did
when
he
went
in
with
father
was
to
overhaul
our
whole
system
of
ventilation
so
the
office
is
never
stuffy
even
in
winter
don
t
be
belligerent
or
i
ll
not
be
responsible
for
the
soothing
effects
of
my
society
what
can
i
do
to
lull
you
to
repose
you
don
t
like
banjo
music
or
i
d
have
brought
my
banjo
over
it
s
just
the
evening
for
that
if
you
had
you
d
have
gone
home
again
you
in
a
sweet
mood
brant
spoke
with
the
familiarity
of
old
acquaintance
would
you
object
to
telling
me
what
s
gone
wrong
with
your
ladyship
i
can
t
find
out
the
french
for
certain
phrases
it
s
necessary
to
use
in
the
correspondence
we
have
on
hand
just
now
there
are
no
equivalents
for
the
idioms
that
i
can
discover
as
yet
and
it
s
most
important
that
i
get
them
right
i
ve
practically
had
to
make
a
for
myself
so
far
because
the
dictionaries
and
don
t
give
the
terms
i
want
i
got
hold
of
some
old
correspondence
last
week
that
helped
me
immensely
but
i
was
completely
baffled
i
suppose
it
has
got
on
my
nerves
and
made
me
fractious
yet
she
did
not
look
particularly
lying
there
in
the
low
chair
in
her
thin
white
frock
her
round
arms
resting
upon
the
arms
of
the
chair
her
head
thrown
back
as
she
regarded
her
visitor
from
under
lashes
neither
did
she
look
in
the
least
like
the
young
woman
of
business
she
had
become
brant
was
always
trying
to
convince
himself
that
her
work
was
spoiling
her
it
would
be
a
comforting
realisation
if
he
could
think
it
but
as
often
as
he
had
succeeded
in
making
himself
half
believe
that
some
other
girl
whose
ways
of
living
were
such
as
he
approved
was
nearly
as
attractive
as
shirley
townsend
just
so
often
did
the
sight
of
shirley
in
some
unbusinesslike
surroundings
upset
his
convictions
she
looked
particularly
feminine
and
alluring
in
spite
of
her
avowed
fractiousness
and
her
explanation
of
the
cause
all
baffling
things
wear
on
one
he
answered
with
an
air
of
being
sympathetic
i
know
how
it
is
from
experience
i
d
like
a
dictionary
or
a
myself
one
that
would
tell
me
what
to
say
to
you
when
you
want
to
be
shall
i
go
in
and
get
a
book
of
verse
and
read
aloud
to
you
please
don
t
fiction
then
worse
and
worse
history
philosophy
science
travel
or
humour
none
of
them
i
don
t
like
to
be
read
to
as
a
duty
duty
i
d
be
delighted
i
should
n
t
then
what
you
want
silence
i
think
said
the
girl
in
the
chair
with
a
mischievous
look
at
the
back
of
her
companion
s
head
her
face
was
demure
again
however
when
he
turned
don
t
you
like
just
to
sit
and
gaze
off
into
space
on
a
languid
night
like
this
and
say
nothing
at
all
if
you
prefer
to
have
me
go
home
not
in
the
least
i
d
like
to
know
you
were
there
on
call
if
you
would
n
t
talk
a
silence
of
some
length
ensued
brant
stared
moodily
off
over
the
darkening
lawn
watching
distant
electric
lights
twinkle
into
existence
along
the
rows
of
which
outlined
the
streets
shirley
closed
her
eyes
she
really
was
more
weary
than
she
knew
it
had
been
a
busy
winter
in
the
office
and
she
had
worked
hard
to
be
able
to
fill
the
place
she
held
her
achievements
in
the
matter
of
the
technical
french
correspondence
had
proved
of
considerable
importance
to
the
firm
and
her
satisfaction
at
becoming
so
useful
had
led
her
to
spend
much
of
her
spare
time
in
making
herself
proficient
it
was
fully
fifteen
minutes
he
thought
it
at
least
an
hour
before
brant
looked
around
he
had
vowed
to
himself
that
he
would
give
her
all
the
silence
she
wanted
that
he
would
not
speak
until
she
spoke
but
after
a
time
her
absolute
motionlessness
struck
him
as
caused
by
something
even
less
flattering
to
himself
than
her
desire
for
absence
of
speech
confound
it
i
believe
she
s
gone
to
sleep
he
said
to
himself
and
rose
abruptly
to
stand
looking
down
at
her
discomfited
and
very
nearly
angry
of
all
the
odd
girls
one
who
would
tell
you
to
stop
talking
and
then
go
off
to
sleep
in
your
presence
was
certainly
the
oddest
he
supposed
she
might
be
tired
and
with
reason
but
to
go
to
sleep
the
shaded
electric
bulbs
which
hung
at
each
corner
of
the
porch
at
this
moment
came
glowingly
into
life
as
somebody
within
switched
on
the
current
they
were
not
designed
to
illuminate
the
porch
strongly
only
to
turn
its
gloom
into
a
mellow
moonlight
effect
but
the
light
was
quite
sufficient
to
show
brant
that
although
shirley
s
lashes
still
swept
her
cheek
her
lips
were
smiling
it
was
a
frightful
test
of
your
friendship
n
t
it
she
murmured
without
opening
her
eyes
but
you
did
nobly
i
never
thought
you
could
hold
out
so
long
you
rascal
i
ll
wager
you
wanted
to
talk
yourself
after
a
while
of
course
i
did
the
minute
a
woman
gets
what
she
wants
she
wants
something
else
what
is
it
now
me
to
go
home
how
distrustful
of
yourself
you
are
that
s
the
effect
you
usually
have
on
me
brant
drew
up
a
chair
shirley
he
began
again
abruptly
do
you
know
what
i
wish
no
do
you
want
to
know
it
not
badly
you
don
t
care
a
straw
for
me
do
you
several
straws
you
do
i
say
a
door
opened
sophy
said
deferentially
you
re
wanted
at
the
telephone
if
you
please
miss
shirley
shirley
vanished
brant
rose
and
paced
about
the
porch
waiting
of
course
it
s
no
use
he
said
discontentedly
to
himself
i
ve
got
as
far
as
this
forty
times
and
no
farther
the
next
thing
she
did
would
be
to
throw
a
soaking
wet
blanket
over
me
i
ought
to
be
used
to
it
but
she
might
at
least
take
me
seriously
she
never
does
it
s
no
good
this
growing
up
with
a
girl
and
then
trying
to
convince
her
that
you
mean
anything
when
you
speak
inside
shirley
was
listening
to
a
rapid
fire
of
words
which
woke
her
up
as
thoroughly
as
anything
had
ever
done
in
her
life
they
came
in
the
voice
of
peter
bell
a
voice
at
once
excited
and
controlled
shirley
the
factory
is
on
fire
i
don
t
want
father
to
hear
about
it
he
d
come
down
you
understand
will
you
think
up
some
way
to
get
him
off
with
yourself
for
the
next
hour
we
ll
probably
have
to
turn
in
a
general
alarm
and
if
we
do
somebody
ll
be
sure
to
call
him
up
and
tell
him
that
s
all
i
can
count
on
you
yes
yes
peter
but
peter
was
already
gone
evidently
he
had
no
time
to
spare
for
answering
questions
shirley
turned
away
from
the
telephone
thinking
rapidly
she
knew
that
joseph
bell
was
at
home
for
she
had
seen
him
an
hour
earlier
training
vines
over
the
front
porch
she
understood
that
peter
had
remained
for
late
work
at
the
factory
office
as
he
so
often
did
although
it
was
now
nearly
nine
o
clock
and
she
knew
well
that
it
would
never
do
for
peter
s
father
to
go
down
to
the
burning
building
the
excitement
of
a
great
fire
at
his
own
place
of
business
would
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
him
joseph
bell
had
kept
steadily
on
at
his
work
throughout
the
year
and
nothing
that
peter
had
feared
had
happened
it
had
been
arranged
somehow
so
that
the
most
fatiguing
part
of
his
duties
now
came
upon
the
broad
shoulders
of
the
son
instead
of
the
bent
ones
of
the
father
but
it
was
as
necessary
as
ever
that
there
should
be
no
sudden
strain
either
physical
or
mental
and
it
was
this
which
she
now
must
prevent
brant
hille
waiting
impatiently
outside
saw
shirley
fly
back
to
him
and
looked
up
at
her
with
gratification
but
her
first
words
made
him
sit
up
for
she
spoke
in
haste
brant
is
your
car
ready
for
a
start
always
is
want
to
will
you
get
it
quick
the
armstrong
is
on
fire
bell
mustn
t
know
it
i
can
t
stop
to
explain
i
must
get
him
away
where
he
won
t
hear
i
ll
go
ask
him
and
bell
to
take
a
drive
with
us
out
to
the
farm
perhaps
i
ll
run
over
you
drive
round
there
will
you
why
on
earth
should
n
t
he
know
he
oh
don
t
stop
to
talk
about
it
i
ll
tell
you
afterward
the
general
alarm
may
go
in
any
minute
and
somebody
will
telephone
him
if
he
s
at
the
house
quick
please
of
course
brant
did
not
understand
but
shirley
s
manner
was
not
to
be
taken
lightly
even
as
she
spoke
she
left
him
and
ran
indoors
again
well
if
he
could
serve
her
it
would
be
better
than
having
to
sit
beside
her
in
silence
while
she
thought
about
technical
french
phrases
besides
he
was
an
enthusiastic
motorist
and
a
hurry
call
for
the
car
always
gave
him
more
or
less
pleasure
he
bolted
across
the
lawn
through
the
hedge
by
a
short
cut
to
the
street
and
so
to
his
own
home
on
the
farther
side
of
worthington
square
shirley
hurried
across
gay
street
having
stopped
only
to
pick
up
a
long
coat
and
scarf
she
caught
sight
of
bell
s
light
skirt
at
the
edge
of
the
of
the
porch
isn
t
it
a
perfect
night
bell
heard
a
familiar
voice
ask
don
t
you
and
bell
want
to
take
a
gentle
little
spin
down
northboro
road
in
hille
s
car
he
s
asked
me
out
and
given
me
leave
to
invite
whomever
i
want
i
d
love
to
have
you
brant
hille
inviting
and
joseph
bell
to
go
motoring
with
him
at
nine
o
clock
on
a
may
evening
there
was
no
precedent
for
this
but
bell
with
the
intuition
of
the
mother
of
young
people
thought
she
understood
shirley
wanted
a
chaperon
and
her
kind
young
heart
prompted
her
to
ask
a
pair
who
were
not
much
accustomed
to
the
delights
of
automobiling
in
the
moonlight
why
yes
we
ll
go
said
bell
getting
up
from
his
we
re
all
alone
the
young
people
are
off
at
a
party
if
you
ll
persuade
the
young
man
not
to
put
on
too
much
speed
so
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
party
were
settling
themselves
in
the
big
green
car
its
headlights
making
a
wide
brilliant
track
before
it
down
the
quiet
street
all
ready
asked
hille
and
started
the
car
as
it
began
to
move
the
distant
but
distinct
sound
of
a
struck
upon
shirley
s
ear
bell
turned
his
head
was
that
in
our
house
he
asked
bell
was
tying
a
scarf
over
her
hair
slightly
muffling
her
ears
she
had
not
heard
go
on
fast
breathed
shirley
in
hille
s
ear
the
street
was
nearly
empty
and
he
obeyed
for
a
moment
bell
s
attention
was
taken
by
the
new
sensation
of
speed
not
appreciable
speed
from
the
motorist
s
because
the
car
was
within
city
limits
but
to
the
novice
considerable
at
the
intersection
of
gay
street
with
conner
street
it
was
possible
to
look
for
a
moment
straight
down
toward
the
heart
of
the
city
into
the
business
district
a
red
glare
was
plainly
visible
although
partly
dimmed
by
hundreds
of
twinkling
electric
lights
between
must
be
a
big
fire
said
bell
straining
his
eyes
to
see
then
the
trees
and
houses
hid
the
city
from
view
it
was
down
our
way
too
i
wish
i
could
telephone
the
factory
and
find
out
peter
s
there
he
d
know
might
be
that
was
our
that
rang
i
did
n
t
hear
any
bell
dear
his
wife
assured
him
a
fire
always
looks
nearer
than
it
is
said
hille
over
his
shoulder
driving
on
without
diminishing
his
speed
instead
he
accelerated
it
the
street
was
a
quiet
one
there
was
nobody
in
sight
one
summer
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
we
were
staying
in
the
country
father
and
i
walked
half
a
mile
to
see
a
fire
and
found
a
big
red
moon
coming
up
behind
the
trees
said
shirley
and
talked
lightly
on
brant
seconded
her
efforts
with
skill
for
which
she
inwardly
thanked
him
and
between
them
they
soon
had
the
thoughts
of
their
guests
far
away
from
the
dangerous
subject
they
ran
quickly
through
the
suburbs
out
into
the
open
country
taking
the
northboro
road
for
that
course
led
directly
away
from
the
red
glare
which
as
shirley
covertly
glanced
back
from
time
to
time
could
be
clearly
perceived
on
the
western
side
of
the
city
behind
them
gaily
as
she
talked
and
laughed
the
girl
s
thoughts
were
with
peter
he
was
somewhere
back
in
that
red
glare
working
without
doubt
if
there
were
anything
for
him
to
do
she
was
thankful
that
it
was
after
hours
and
that
there
were
probably
few
of
the
factory
hands
about
the
place
yet
there
were
undoubtedly
many
things
to
be
saved
in
the
office
books
and
papers
and
drawings
she
knew
peter
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
his
own
personal
safety
would
be
the
last
thing
he
would
think
of
so
long
as
he
could
do
what
might
look
like
his
duty
to
the
house
he
served
the
bells
did
not
know
how
far
they
went
nor
did
they
guess
at
what
a
pace
brant
s
machine
was
a
fine
one
and
he
was
an
expert
at
smooth
running
the
flight
through
the
warm
moonlight
was
a
delightful
experience
for
few
curves
and
no
sharp
grades
gave
accent
to
the
speed
and
the
hour
flew
by
as
swiftly
as
the
road
when
they
turned
again
toward
the
city
the
crimson
glow
upon
the
clouds
had
gone
the
fire
is
out
remarked
bell
as
they
arrived
at
the
top
of
a
small
hill
in
the
suburbs
from
which
he
could
see
into
the
heart
of
the
business
district
hope
it
was
n
t
as
serious
as
it
looked
but
brant
s
eyes
and
shirley
s
younger
and
sharper
could
make
out
a
dense
mass
of
smoke
hanging
over
the
place
where
the
flames
had
been
it
won
t
do
to
take
them
home
yet
thought
the
girl
setting
her
wits
at
work
again
the
result
was
an
invitation
to
the
bells
to
alight
at
the
great
porch
of
the
townsend
house
instead
of
in
gay
street
with
the
promise
of
some
light
refreshment
at
first
they
shook
their
heads
but
hille
declared
so
loudly
that
he
knew
what
shirley
had
to
offer
and
could
not
think
of
letting
them
down
short
of
the
full
measure
of
the
entertainment
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
out
without
spoiling
the
pleasure
of
the
two
young
people
so
presently
they
were
all
partaking
of
a
hastily
concocted
iced
drink
served
with
tiny
cakes
and
laughing
over
hille
s
stories
of
certain
college
incidents
which
he
told
with
gusto
incited
thereto
by
shirley
s
whispered
you
re
helping
me
splendidly
please
keep
it
up
and
i
ll
be
forever
in
your
debt
if
there
s
any
way
of
making
you
forever
in
my
debt
brant
made
reply
under
his
breath
i
ll
do
a
continuous
performance
for
your
friends
till
daylight
but
such
an
effort
as
this
would
have
been
was
unnecessary
bell
presently
took
her
husband
away
and
since
it
was
a
late
hour
and
no
other
chaperons
appeared
upon
the
scene
brant
was
forced
to
go
also
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
making
any
further
attempts
at
gaining
headway
in
shirley
s
good
graces
for
although
she
dismissed
him
with
hearty
thanks
it
was
with
an
air
of
abstraction
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
her
one
desire
was
to
hear
the
ring
again
and
learn
that
although
the
factory
might
have
burned
to
the
ground
no
lives
were
lost
and
that
not
a
hair
of
her
friend
s
head
was
hurt
she
stood
alone
upon
the
porch
waiting
anxiously
when
the
townsend
landau
drove
in
at
the
gate
bringing
home
murray
and
jane
who
had
been
out
to
dinner
there
she
is
said
murray
with
suppressed
excitement
the
next
instant
he
was
out
had
whirled
jane
out
also
and
was
grasping
his
young
sister
s
hands
don
t
be
frightened
it
s
all
right
but
a
few
things
have
happened
this
evening
the
armstrong
factory
i
know
is
it
gone
to
the
foundations
peter
found
the
fire
fought
it
alone
till
the
firemen
came
rescued
the
played
the
leading
part
generally
till
an
accident
put
him
out
my
word
that
fellow
well
he
s
all
right
but
he
s
burned
a
bit
and
his
leg
s
broken
he
was
so
confoundedly
risky
trying
to
save
the
last
calendar
on
the
wall
where
is
he
martin
s
hospital
we
ve
just
come
from
there
he
got
his
the
first
after
the
thing
began
so
there
s
been
time
to
get
him
fixed
up
our
man
larrabee
was
at
the
fire
saw
peter
put
into
the
ambulance
and
telephoned
me
at
the
kingsfords
tried
three
times
to
get
his
people
at
home
but
could
n
t
see
here
he
wants
you
to
tell
his
mother
says
jane
is
too
much
upset
illustration
larrabee
was
at
the
fire
and
saw
peter
put
into
the
ambulance
shirley
looked
at
jane
i
m
not
upset
said
jane
but
her
lips
were
unsteady
murray
put
his
arm
around
her
you
see
larrabee
thought
it
was
worse
than
it
was
with
peter
when
they
put
him
in
the
ambulance
he
was
stunned
by
the
fall
that
broke
his
leg
it
gave
janey
a
bad
shock
and
no
wonder
it
did
me
but
the
old
boy
s
himself
again
all
right
and
his
one
idea
is
to
let
his
mother
know
why
he
does
n
t
come
home
but
to
keep
even
the
news
of
the
factory
fire
from
his
father
if
he
can
we
don
t
see
why
but
he
seems
to
so
we
ll
follow
his
wishes
it
s
the
least
we
can
do
for
him
shirley
slipped
through
the
hedge
and
slowly
crossed
gay
street
in
the
moonlight
she
was
trying
hard
to
be
cool
and
do
as
peter
wanted
her
to
do
if
she
rang
bell
would
come
to
the
door
and
then
how
should
she
manage
what
excuse
should
she
give
she
thought
of
a
way
bell
she
said
when
he
appeared
janey
s
come
home
from
her
party
and
she
s
had
just
a
little
bit
too
much
party
she
feels
like
a
small
girl
again
and
wants
her
mother
to
come
over
for
a
few
minutes
why
of
course
said
bell
heartily
from
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
nothing
much
the
matter
with
the
little
girl
oh
no
she
ll
be
all
right
in
the
morning
so
bell
crossed
the
road
with
shirley
and
the
girl
with
her
arm
round
the
elder
woman
s
shoulders
gently
told
her
the
news
bell
took
it
as
peter
had
known
she
would
quietly
although
aside
from
his
personal
injury
there
was
much
cause
for
anxious
thought
in
the
loss
of
the
factory
and
the
consequent
putting
of
its
workers
out
of
employment
when
peter
s
mother
had
gone
home
again
resting
on
murray
s
promise
that
in
the
morning
he
would
take
her
to
the
hospital
shirley
turned
to
her
brother
he
had
taken
jane
upstairs
and
come
down
again
himself
too
restless
to
go
to
bed
he
discovered
his
sister
to
be
in
a
like
mood
and
they
sat
down
once
more
in
the
moonlit
porch
to
talk
it
over
regardless
of
the
hour
which
was
past
midnight
i
wonder
sometimes
said
murray
suddenly
when
he
had
told
shirley
in
detail
all
he
knew
of
the
events
of
the
evening
whether
anybody
but
me
fully
appreciates
that
chap
peter
bell
do
you
know
what
i
ve
been
thinking
a
long
time
that
he
s
the
man
we
need
at
the
head
of
one
of
our
departments
from
all
i
can
learn
he
s
been
growing
as
nearly
invaluable
to
the
armstrongs
as
a
man
can
be
yet
they
have
n
t
raised
his
salary
for
two
years
now
s
our
chance
to
jump
in
and
get
him
if
i
can
only
convince
father
and
i
think
he
s
pretty
nearly
convinced
i
ll
make
peter
an
offer
pretty
good
medicine
for
a
broken
leg
and
burned
hands
eh
i
should
hope
it
would
be
you
d
like
to
see
him
in
the
business
would
n
t
you
if
you
think
him
fit
for
it
if
i
think
him
fit
what
about
you
how
can
i
judge
it
s
for
you
to
say
murray
looked
sharply
at
her
in
the
shaded
light
of
the
electric
bulbs
he
smiled
for
in
spite
of
her
remarkably
quiet
manner
her
fingers
unconsciously
twisting
and
untwisting
her
delicate
handkerchief
were
as
he
put
it
to
himself
giving
her
away
he
had
an
idea
that
it
mattered
a
good
deal
to
his
sister
what
peter
bell
s
future
might
be
although
he
was
confident
that
there
was
no
understanding
between
them
if
he
knew
peter
that
young
man
was
not
the
one
to
ask
to
marry
a
rich
man
s
daughter
until
his
own
feet
were
on
substantial
ground
but
that
peter
cared
and
cared
very
deeply
for
murray
townsend
s
sister
murray
was
well
assured
it
s
for
me
to
say
is
it
he
went
on
wickedly
persisting
in
his
theme
but
it
s
for
you
to
think
how
about
having
him
round
our
office
every
day
desk
next
mine
giving
you
dictation
now
and
then
maybe
when
it
suits
me
to
put
it
off
on
him
think
you
could
stand
it
look
up
at
him
as
coolly
as
you
do
at
me
could
you
miss
townsend
stenographer
see
here
what
are
you
jumping
up
for
because
you
are
getting
impudent
responded
miss
townsend
turning
her
head
so
that
her
face
was
in
shadow
her
heart
was
beating
so
quickly
she
was
afraid
her
brother
would
recognise
the
fact
it
had
been
an
agitating
evening
all
through
and
now
this
last
suggestion
was
rather
more
than
she
could
face
with
composure
i
ve
a
notion
himself
could
put
up
with
the
situation
went
on
murray
watching
her
his
dictation
might
be
a
trifle
flurried
at
first
and
he
might
forget
himself
now
and
then
and
ignore
those
purely
businesslike
relations
which
should
always
exist
between
a
business
man
and
his
stenographer
but
i
ve
no
doubt
that
by
a
judicious
course
of
snubbing
you
could
but
he
was
talking
to
the
empty
air
by
a
hasty
flight
and
the
abrupt
closing
of
a
door
his
sister
had
put
herself
out
of
range
chapter
x
peter
prefers
the
porch
you
re
quite
sure
you
want
me
asked
peter
bell
quite
sure
replied
murray
townsend
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
looked
into
each
other
peter
s
gaze
shifted
to
his
father
i
ll
do
it
under
one
condition
he
said
that
father
gives
up
factory
work
and
goes
to
live
at
the
old
farm
harrison
townsend
turned
also
toward
joseph
bell
he
smiled
slightly
noting
the
hesitation
of
the
other
man
it
s
time
you
and
i
retired
bell
said
he
i
ve
been
getting
to
the
point
for
a
long
time
let
s
make
a
bargain
of
it
if
you
ll
go
back
to
the
farm
i
ll
come
and
spend
a
good
share
of
my
time
there
i
d
like
to
help
with
the
haying
i
should
enjoy
watching
the
cows
come
home
i
ll
venture
to
say
i
could
drive
a
for
an
hour
or
two
the
four
men
occupied
the
small
rear
porch
of
the
house
in
gay
street
looking
out
on
nancy
s
garden
peter
lay
upon
a
couch
his
leg
in
splints
his
hands
in
bandages
after
a
few
days
at
the
hospital
he
had
been
brought
home
to
spend
the
long
hours
of
his
recovery
where
he
could
bear
them
best
the
other
three
were
close
by
murray
nearest
he
had
put
off
making
his
proposition
to
peter
until
he
and
his
father
could
arrive
at
a
perfect
agreement
as
to
every
term
of
the
offer
joseph
bell
met
his
son
s
meaning
gaze
with
understanding
he
knew
nothing
counted
with
peter
as
did
the
anxiety
over
his
father
s
physical
condition
he
had
kept
his
boy
a
long
time
upon
the
rack
because
of
his
own
unwillingness
to
give
up
his
old
work
but
the
work
was
taken
away
from
him
now
there
would
be
a
considerable
interval
before
the
armstrongs
would
be
ready
for
him
again
and
he
could
hardly
think
of
trying
for
a
new
position
meanwhile
the
haying
season
was
approaching
he
thought
with
longing
of
the
scent
of
the
newly
cut
grass
he
could
not
work
hard
out
under
the
sun
he
knew
that
but
he
could
play
at
work
and
his
friend
harrison
townsend
rich
man
though
he
was
was
offering
to
play
too
he
looked
at
peter
and
smiled
under
his
short
gray
beard
peter
smiled
back
entreatingly
slowly
joseph
bell
nodded
all
right
peter
he
said
i
ll
let
you
have
your
way
at
last
for
a
moment
peter
could
not
speak
he
lay
with
dropped
eyelids
fighting
lest
the
sudden
relief
from
the
long
strain
should
unman
him
before
these
who
had
been
paying
tribute
to
his
manhood
but
after
a
short
space
he
looked
from
townsend
to
his
son
i
ll
come
said
he
and
forgetting
his
bandaged
hands
started
to
hold
one
out
then
he
smiled
whimsically
and
added
in
an
odd
tone
if
you
re
not
afraid
of
the
bad
omen
in
taking
on
a
man
with
a
pair
of
hands
like
these
not
much
when
we
remember
what
put
them
in
that
shape
declared
murray
in
a
tone
of
great
satisfaction
and
his
father
gave
an
emphatic
assent
what
do
you
think
s
going
to
happen
cried
nancy
rushing
out
upon
peter
s
porch
a
week
later
give
it
up
but
nothing
can
surprise
me
after
recent
events
replied
peter
removing
his
gaze
for
a
moment
from
the
morning
newspaper
pinned
up
in
front
of
him
to
the
excited
face
of
his
sister
but
looking
immediately
back
again
at
the
absorbing
column
of
business
news
he
had
been
with
some
difficulty
perusing
his
hands
had
been
slow
in
recovering
from
the
severe
injuries
they
had
received
this
will
somebody
s
going
to
be
married
remarkable
but
such
events
have
occurred
before
in
the
history
of
nations
replied
her
brother
abstractedly
not
at
the
townsend
house
for
murray
married
jane
over
here
ah
ha
i
thought
you
d
give
me
your
undivided
attention
at
last
crowed
nancy
triumphantly
peter
did
his
best
to
look
unconcerned
but
his
heart
had
begun
to
thump
quite
suddenly
and
disconcertingly
he
waited
he
forgot
the
newspaper
have
n
t
you
noticed
how
devoted
brant
hille
has
been
for
the
last
year
nancy
demanded
no
then
you
ve
been
blind
i
ve
been
busy
how
oddly
you
speak
is
your
throat
sore
don
t
tease
nan
i
m
not
up
to
it
it
was
no
use
trying
to
look
unconcerned
nancy
saw
and
took
pity
on
him
as
she
might
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
upon
his
feet
it
s
olive
then
though
i
believe
i
could
have
made
you
think
it
was
shirley
it
s
not
brant
hille
s
fault
that
it
is
n
t
i
can
tell
you
that
olive
s
going
to
marry
an
englishman
she
met
last
summer
abroad
arthur
crewe
of
manchester
it
s
just
announced
the
wedding
s
to
be
the
first
of
july
you
ll
be
on
crutches
peter
is
n
t
that
lucky
you
can
go
oh
yes
i
ll
dance
at
the
wedding
agreed
peter
looking
as
if
the
shot
that
missed
him
had
come
uncomfortably
close
it
s
going
to
be
a
big
wedding
a
gorgeous
one
is
n
t
that
like
olive
shirley
s
to
be
maid
of
honour
and
there
ll
be
six
bridesmaids
six
ushers
and
you
d
have
been
one
if
you
had
n
t
broken
your
leg
olive
told
me
so
compensation
in
all
things
murmured
peter
the
best
man
is
the
englishman
s
brother
olive
says
he
s
stunning
would
n
t
it
be
funny
if
he
and
shirley
should
take
a
fancy
to
each
other
the
maid
of
honour
and
the
best
man
often
do
you
know
very
interesting
i
should
say
you
had
been
taking
a
course
of
novels
you
re
so
full
of
possible
plots
and
peter
eyed
his
newspaper
as
if
he
preferred
its
practical
columns
to
his
sister
s
outlines
of
sentimental
situations
nancy
laughed
shirley
s
to
have
a
vacation
for
a
week
before
the
wedding
perhaps
she
ll
find
time
to
get
over
to
see
you
oftener
then
she
s
been
over
to
see
me
how
many
times
twice
for
how
long
five
minutes
the
first
time
three
the
second
how
many
other
people
present
a
dozen
or
so
have
a
satisfactory
visit
oh
very
peter
hit
the
newspaper
with
his
elbow
and
it
fell
down
what
have
you
got
it
in
for
me
this
morning
for
sis
he
demanded
wrathfully
nancy
stopped
laughing
and
looked
serious
it
won
t
hurt
you
any
it
may
wake
you
up
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
i
m
honestly
and
truly
worried
about
brant
hille
then
she
vanished
and
peter
lay
wishing
he
had
two
good
legs
that
he
might
get
up
and
go
and
see
for
himself
just
how
much
all
this
meant
he
read
the
newspaper
no
more
that
morning
it
lay
forgotten
on
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
the
weeks
went
by
slowly
enough
to
the
convalescent
impatient
to
begin
his
new
work
and
full
of
plans
for
it
long
talks
with
murray
helped
most
to
make
the
waiting
endurable
and
the
two
young
men
grew
to
know
and
respect
each
other
still
more
deeply
than
ever
before
everybody
was
kind
both
and
townsend
came
often
to
see
peter
and
even
olive
although
at
times
distraught
with
the
business
of
preparation
for
her
approaching
marriage
found
a
now
and
then
in
which
to
slip
across
to
gay
street
and
talk
with
him
at
these
times
she
found
decided
refreshment
in
his
society
for
peter
s
ideas
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
were
both
novel
and
sensible
and
in
after
years
she
often
found
herself
remembering
and
putting
into
practice
one
or
another
of
his
quizzical
maxims
founded
on
much
shrewd
observation
you
are
coming
to
my
wedding
you
know
she
said
on
the
last
of
these
occasions
three
days
before
the
date
set
for
that
event
and
i
want
you
at
dinner
the
evening
before
so
you
may
get
to
know
crewe
and
he
you
as
well
as
you
can
in
one
short
evening
i
m
so
disappointed
he
could
n
t
be
here
all
this
week
as
he
planned
dinners
weddings
on
these
sticks
scoffed
peter
that
day
promoted
to
crutches
and
finding
them
as
yet
merely
invitations
to
ironic
humour
certainly
if
you
make
them
an
excuse
for
staying
away
i
shall
never
forgive
you
please
let
me
off
from
the
dinner
if
you
ll
put
me
in
the
porch
and
let
me
be
found
there
afterward
i
ll
agree
but
i
can
t
hobble
out
to
the
table
on
crutches
of
torture
not
even
to
take
out
shirley
olive
glanced
at
him
mischievously
and
saw
him
colour
slightly
as
he
answered
that
would
be
an
inducement
if
anything
would
but
i
m
sure
you
ll
adopt
my
point
of
view
if
i
beg
you
to
then
i
shall
have
to
send
her
in
with
geoffrey
crewe
or
brant
hille
will
the
men
stay
behind
when
the
ladies
come
out
yes
of
course
then
i
prefer
the
porch
persisted
peter
comfortably
and
olive
acknowledged
that
he
had
chosen
the
wiser
part
so
on
tuesday
evening
when
shirley
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
young
women
floated
airily
out
from
the
brightly
lighted
and
oppressively
warm
to
the
cool
softly
lighted
recesses
of
the
great
porch
it
was
with
a
sense
of
refreshing
change
that
she
went
straight
to
the
big
chair
by
a
pillar
where
peter
sat
waiting
for
her
as
she
dropped
into
a
low
seat
by
his
side
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
show
to
greater
advantage
although
he
could
not
rise
to
do
her
honour
and
could
only
say
with
a
straight
upward
glance
this
is
kind
of
you
i
ve
been
thinking
for
an
hour
how
you
d
look
when
you
came
out
that
door
do
i
look
it
my
imagination
fell
a
long
way
short
it
s
months
since
i
ve
seen
you
in
this
sort
of
thing
he
indicated
her
gauzy
evening
frock
of
pale
a
wreath
of
tiny
rosebuds
crowned
her
hair
a
little
silver
basket
of
roses
lay
in
her
lap
a
dinner
favour
like
those
the
others
carried
but
suiting
her
attire
with
special
charm
do
you
remember
our
first
party
asked
shirley
smiling
at
him
i
certainly
do
peter
assured
her
you
had
on
a
white
dress
and
pink
ribbons
pink
slippers
too
you
came
up
and
slid
your
hand
into
mine
because
you
saw
i
was
feeling
lonely
you
were
jolly
kind
to
me
that
night
and
i
never
forgot
it
i
suppose
i
was
a
pitiful
object
standing
there
looking
on
all
by
myself
you
did
n
t
look
pitiful
at
all
but
rather
superior
if
i
remember
like
a
big
bernard
condescending
to
watch
the
antics
of
a
lot
of
frolicsome
terriers
peter
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
low
with
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
whatever
there
might
have
been
that
was
odd
about
peter
s
appearance
at
that
first
party
there
could
be
no
criticism
of
his
looks
olive
taking
critical
note
of
shirley
s
companion
owned
that
she
should
feel
no
hesitation
in
presenting
him
to
arthur
crewe
and
his
brother
as
a
connection
of
the
family
when
that
moment
arrived
the
american
and
the
englishmen
appeared
to
take
a
frank
liking
to
one
another
on
the
spot
for
the
crewes
both
sat
down
to
talk
and
peter
sitting
up
met
them
in
a
cordial
effort
to
become
acquainted
in
the
brief
time
allotted
them
will
you
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
it
was
olive
slipping
for
a
moment
toward
the
end
of
the
evening
into
the
chair
by
peter
s
he
being
temporarily
left
to
himself
i
think
he
s
a
man
said
peter
heartily
and
to
the
point
there
s
nothing
better
i
could
say
than
that
is
there
i
suppose
not
being
one
yourself
a
woman
would
think
it
necessary
to
add
a
number
of
complimentary
things
about
his
appearance
and
his
manner
and
all
that
i
could
do
that
at
a
pinch
said
peter
smiling
for
my
memory
would
tell
me
that
they
were
all
right
though
i
thought
nothing
about
them
at
the
time
i
was
looking
to
see
what
it
was
you
were
going
to
marry
and
i
found
out
as
far
as
a
s
talk
would
show
it
i
wish
you
great
happiness
olive
and
i
believe
you
ll
get
it
thank
you
and
olive
was
gone
again
being
in
constant
demand
as
the
central
figure
of
the
occasion
she
found
time
however
to
ask
much
the
same
question
of
arthur
crewe
concerning
peter
bell
and
received
so
nearly
the
same
sort
of
answer
that
she
laughed
and
told
him
of
the
similarity
in
the
two
estimates
i
am
flattered
said
crewe
for
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
met
a
young
american
i
ve
liked
better
he
s
both
frank
and
reserved
a
combination
which
appeals
to
me
it
looks
a
bit
as
if
you
were
going
to
have
him
in
the
family
i
believe
you
told
me
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
though
if
you
don
t
mind
my
saying
it
now
that
i
see
your
sister
i
feel
as
if
i
d
like
to
leave
geoffrey
here
for
the
summer
with
deliberate
intention
i
fancy
it
s
too
late
for
that
though
i
m
glad
you
like
peter
it
would
be
too
unkind
to
the
family
to
take
more
than
one
daughter
to
england
see
how
well
geoffrey
appreciates
his
privileges
whispered
crewe
indicating
his
brother
as
that
personable
young
man
went
by
with
shirley
his
manner
suggesting
concentration
of
attention
upon
the
subject
in
hand
then
he
looked
in
peter
s
direction
the
chap
in
the
chair
isn
t
deserted
is
he
i
think
each
bridesmaid
has
taken
a
turn
at
him
and
he
seems
equal
to
them
all
however
this
might
have
been
peter
found
himself
thoroughly
weary
at
the
end
of
the
evening
and
glad
to
be
put
into
a
wheeled
chair
and
taken
home
ignominious
as
that
mode
of
departure
seemed
arthur
crewe
insisted
on
walking
at
peter
s
elbow
all
the
way
round
to
the
house
in
gay
street
and
the
two
parted
with
friendly
warmth
of
on
each
side
according
to
nancy
who
kept
peter
informed
geoffrey
crewe
neglected
none
of
the
opportunities
afforded
him
by
his
brief
visit
and
in
one
way
and
another
shirley
was
kept
busy
all
the
next
day
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
in
the
evening
so
peter
had
plenty
of
time
to
rest
and
reflect
on
the
advantages
an
man
has
over
a
temporary
cripple
as
he
caught
glimpses
from
time
to
time
of
such
sights
as
shirley
driving
off
in
the
trap
with
the
younger
englishman
or
sitting
beside
brant
hille
as
he
took
a
portion
of
the
bridal
party
away
for
a
spin
in
his
big
green
car
olive
had
chosen
to
be
married
at
home
so
every
effort
at
effective
decoration
had
been
expended
upon
the
house
and
grounds
in
worthington
square
for
a
hot
night
in
july
it
was
expected
that
the
outdoor
arrangements
would
be
most
popular
and
the
great
lawn
with
its
natural
beauties
of
enhanced
by
the
devices
of
electricity
and
chinese
lanterns
flowers
and
bunting
was
like
a
fairyland
if
a
fellow
s
will
amounted
to
anything
a
scene
like
this
would
make
him
get
on
his
legs
if
both
of
them
were
only
just
out
of
the
groaned
peter
as
he
was
brought
through
the
gates
by
rufus
at
an
early
hour
he
took
note
of
the
paths
winding
away
through
the
grounds
made
enticing
to
promenades
by
every
witchery
of
art
and
his
imagination
already
pictured
shirley
in
her
attire
floating
away
down
one
of
them
devotedly
attended
by
brant
hille
or
geoffrey
crewe
cheer
up
the
role
is
awfully
taking
with
the
girls
you
know
consoled
rufus
divining
the
tantalising
effect
of
this
stage
setting
upon
his
handicapped
brother
wounded
hero
be
shot
retorted
peter
it
would
be
the
most
soothing
thing
that
could
happen
to
him
would
you
like
to
change
places
with
him
instead
of
being
able
to
dash
about
in
search
of
what
you
want
i
shouldn
t
mind
if
my
crippled
condition
seemed
to
have
the
hypnotic
effect
yours
did
last
evening
according
to
nancy
the
was
n
t
in
it
with
you
at
posing
as
an
interesting
figure
she
said
the
bridesmaids
were
four
deep
around
you
things
they
were
nearly
the
finish
of
me
when
i
become
a
society
man
please
notify
my
family
i
shall
not
have
the
brains
myself
i
will
where
will
you
be
placed
for
the
ceremony
behind
a
screen
of
palms
if
possible
requested
peter
he
did
not
get
his
wish
literally
but
by
grace
of
a
special
plea
to
one
of
the
ushers
he
was
put
in
an
inconspicuous
place
of
great
advantage
where
he
could
not
only
view
the
entire
scene
but
could
watch
the
bridal
party
during
its
whole
course
from
to
improvised
altar
beneath
a
canopy
at
one
end
of
the
long
olive
made
a
strikingly
beautiful
bride
as
her
friends
had
known
she
would
and
her
bridesmaids
were
nearly
all
more
than
ordinarily
fair
or
seemed
so
in
their
picturesque
garb
but
to
peter
in
all
the
bridal
party
there
was
only
one
face
and
figure
worth
more
than
a
moment
s
glance
and
when
the
finally
turned
away
from
the
altar
to
take
her
position
by
the
side
of
the
best
man
for
the
ceremonies
of
reception
and
congratulation
which
followed
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
marriage
service
the
one
onlooker
who
could
not
get
up
and
take
his
place
in
the
gay
company
forming
in
line
to
greet
the
bridal
party
was
feeling
more
than
ever
like
a
stranded
in
the
company
of
a
fleet
of
racing
yachts
they
came
to
him
however
when
they
were
free
olive
crewe
and
her
husband
shirley
and
geoffrey
crewe
several
of
the
bridesmaids
and
even
brant
hille
and
peter
said
all
the
things
that
were
expected
of
him
and
said
them
well
he
might
be
no
society
man
as
he
had
said
but
he
possessed
the
and
quickness
of
wit
which
take
the
place
of
familiarity
with
such
situations
arthur
crewe
liked
him
better
than
ever
as
the
two
shook
hands
and
peter
spoke
his
quiet
but
earnest
words
of
felicitation
and
prophecy
for
the
future
i
m
sorry
i
can
t
be
here
to
see
you
when
you
get
about
again
said
crewe
at
parting
i
can
quite
fancy
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
you
put
into
your
work
i
don
t
need
to
see
you
at
yours
to
be
sure
you
re
a
both
at
project
and
performance
responded
peter
smiling
we
d
work
jolly
well
together
i
venture
to
say
said
the
englishman
perhaps
we
ll
have
the
chance
some
day
i
wish
we
might
and
peter
gave
the
friendly
hand
a
hearty
grip
the
best
of
luck
peter
sat
alone
upon
the
townsend
porch
waiting
for
someone
to
come
and
take
him
home
everything
was
over
the
bridal
pair
had
gone
the
last
lingerers
along
the
paths
among
the
shrubbery
had
straggled
in
and
reluctantly
taken
their
departure
the
big
marquee
in
the
centre
of
the
lawn
where
supper
had
been
served
was
empty
except
for
scurrying
caterer
s
men
the
string
orchestra
stationed
in
the
had
at
last
stopped
playing
mopped
their
perspiring
heads
and
packed
up
their
instruments
townsend
had
betaken
herself
to
her
room
in
a
state
of
collapse
requiring
the
attendance
of
her
husband
and
jane
and
murray
paced
up
and
down
the
upper
hall
thinking
to
himself
that
he
had
never
before
realised
what
unpleasant
things
weddings
were
when
they
occurred
in
one
s
own
family
as
for
shirley
no
one
had
laid
eyes
upon
her
since
the
moment
when
the
townsend
landau
had
driven
away
with
everybody
throwing
confetti
and
olive
leaning
out
had
flung
her
bouquet
straight
at
her
sister
s
feet
everybody
had
laughed
as
shirley
picked
it
up
but
the
girl
had
run
away
with
the
white
bridal
roses
crushed
close
against
her
breast
her
lips
set
tight
and
her
eyes
brilliant
with
unshed
tears
she
and
olive
had
been
more
to
each
other
during
this
last
year
than
ever
before
and
england
as
a
place
of
permanent
residence
seemed
a
very
very
long
way
off
it
was
odd
that
at
the
last
everybody
seemed
to
have
forgotten
peter
ross
laughing
with
a
pretty
girl
had
walked
directly
past
him
and
gone
home
unmindful
peter
had
supposed
he
would
come
back
but
he
did
not
the
servants
were
busy
the
quiet
of
the
deserted
porch
restful
and
peter
leaned
his
head
against
one
of
the
tall
white
pillars
thinking
less
of
the
evening
that
was
past
than
of
the
future
that
was
coming
so
soon
as
he
could
walk
sturdily
about
once
more
up
through
the
narrowest
and
least
conspicuous
path
of
all
one
which
few
of
the
wedding
revelers
had
noticed
because
its
entrance
was
designedly
unlighted
came
a
slim
white
figure
with
bent
head
peter
gazing
dreamily
out
over
the
lawn
saw
it
at
once
and
recognised
it
with
a
start
of
gladness
shirley
came
on
across
the
velvety
grass
without
looking
up
and
slowly
ascended
the
porch
steps
with
her
eyes
still
cast
down
reaching
the
top
she
turned
about
and
stood
leaning
against
the
pillar
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
peter
s
chair
without
noticing
his
presence
staring
off
at
the
lights
and
seeing
a
little
misty
halo
about
each
one
when
she
had
stood
motionless
there
for
some
time
peter
spoke
so
quietly
that
he
hardly
startled
her
she
turned
about
with
a
little
choking
breath
said
oh
is
it
you
in
a
tone
of
relief
and
resumed
her
former
position
i
wish
i
could
help
make
it
easier
said
peter
very
gently
you
ve
made
things
easier
for
me
so
many
times
first
and
last
you
do
said
shirley
in
a
do
i
i
m
glad
but
how
just
by
being
there
peter
s
face
lighted
up
this
was
a
most
unusual
tribute
from
his
independent
little
friend
he
got
slowly
to
his
crutches
and
with
a
greater
effort
than
he
had
yet
made
came
stumping
round
to
her
side
of
the
pillar
and
stood
near
her
leaning
against
a
great
green
tub
which
held
a
towering
palm
he
felt
somehow
as
if
he
must
be
literally
upon
his
feet
in
order
to
stand
by
her
in
this
crisis
both
were
silent
again
for
some
minutes
until
suddenly
shirley
looked
round
at
him
and
exclaimed
why
i
mustn
t
let
you
stand
like
this
please
sit
down
again
not
unless
you
do
why
i
m
not
tired
but
i
want
to
be
near
you
i
ve
done
nothing
all
the
evening
but
envy
the
men
who
could
get
about
and
do
things
for
you
you
ll
soon
be
walking
off
at
your
usual
breakneck
pace
said
shirley
the
colour
coming
back
with
a
rush
into
cheeks
which
had
been
pale
since
olive
went
to
the
office
yes
your
office
i
can
hardly
wait
but
i
wonder
sometimes
if
i
can
keep
my
wits
and
do
my
work
there
why
not
don
t
you
know
why
shirley
s
little
moist
ball
of
a
handkerchief
was
all
at
once
being
clutched
very
tight
in
her
fingers
she
shook
her
head
i
think
you
do
i
think
you
must
know
why
i
m
half
out
of
my
head
with
the
prospect
of
being
manager
of
the
new
house
of
townsend
son
i
m
glad
that
you
like
the
prospect
said
shirley
in
the
lowest
of
voices
and
looking
anywhere
but
at
peter
are
you
do
like
it
very
much
peter
forgot
his
crutches
and
one
of
them
fell
with
a
rattle
at
shirley
s
feet
she
would
have
bent
to
pick
it
up
but
he
prevented
her
and
laboriously
reached
for
it
himself
i
m
not
going
said
peter
deliberately
to
let
you
wait
on
me
when
all
in
life
i
want
is
the
chance
to
serve
you
all
my
life
it
would
be
a
very
poor
partnership
said
shirley
in
a
after
a
minute
and
peter
s
heart
stopped
beating
if
the
serving
were
all
on
one
side
and
peter
s
heart
went
thumping
on
again
though
not
in
proper
rhythm
partnership
it
a
partnership
shirley
she
nodded
but
she
moved
three
steps
out
of
reach
peter
made
a
hasty
movement
and
both
crutches
slipped
down
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
and
slid
away
off
the
edge
of
the
porch
to
the
ground
peter
glared
after
them
then
he
looked
at
shirley
standing
there
her
eyes
now
full
of
laughter
oh
get
them
for
me
dear
he
pleaded
or
no
never
mind
the
crutches
just
