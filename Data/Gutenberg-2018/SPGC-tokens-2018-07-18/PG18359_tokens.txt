boyhood
in

earliest
recollections
the
dandy
doctor
terror
deeds
of
daring
the
savagery
of
boys
school
and
fighting
when
i
was
a
boy
in
scotland
i
was
fond
of
everything
that
was
wild
and
all
my
life
i
been
growing
fonder
and
fonder
of
wild
places
and
wild
creatures
fortunately
around
my
native
town
of
dunbar
by
the
stormy
north
sea
there
was
no
lack
of
wildness
though
most
of
the
land
lay
in
smooth
cultivation
with
playmates
wild
as
myself
i
loved
to
wander
in
the
fields
to
hear
the
birds
sing
and
along
the
seashore
to
gaze
and
wonder
at
the
shells
and
seaweeds
eels
and
crabs
in
the
pools
among
the
rocks
when
the
tide
was
low
and
best
of
all
to
watch
the
waves
in
awful
storms
thundering
on
the
black
headlands
and
craggy
ruins
of
the
old
dunbar
castle
when
the
sea
and
the
sky
the
waves
and
the
clouds
were
mingled
together
as
one
we
never
thought
of
playing
truant
but
after
i
was
five
or
six
years
old
i
ran
away
to
the
seashore
or
the
fields
almost
every
saturday
and
every
day
in
the
school
vacations
except
sundays
though
solemnly
warned
that
i
must
play
at
home
in
the
garden
and
back
yard
lest
i
should
learn
to
think
bad
thoughts
and
say
bad
words
all
in
vain
in
spite
of
the
sure
sore
punishments
that
followed
like
shadows
the
natural
inherited
wildness
in
our
blood
ran
true
on
its
glorious
course
as
invincible
and
unstoppable
as
stars
my
earliest
recollections
of
the
country
were
gained
on
short
walks
with
my
grandfather
when
i
was
perhaps
not
over
three
years
old
on
one
of
these
walks
grandfather
took
me
to
lord
lauderdale
gardens
where
i
saw
figs
growing
against
a
sunny
wall
and
tasted
some
of
them
and
got
as
many
apples
to
eat
as
i
wished
on
another
memorable
walk
in
a
when
we
sat
down
to
rest
on
one
of
the
haycocks
i
heard
a
sharp
prickly
stinging
cry
and
jumping
up
eagerly
called
grandfather
attention
to
it
he
said
he
heard
only
the
wind
but
i
insisted
on
digging
into
the
hay
and
turning
it
over
until
we
discovered
the
source
of
the
strange
exciting
sound
a
mother
field
mouse
with
half
a
dozen
naked
young
hanging
to
her
teats
this
to
me
was
a
wonderful
discovery
no
hunter
could
have
been
more
excited
on
discovering
a
bear
and
her
cubs
in
a
wilderness
den
i
was
sent
to
school
before
i
had
completed
my
third
year
the
first
schoolday
was
doubtless
full
of
wonders
but
i
am
not
able
to
recall
any
of
them
i
remember
the
servant
washing
my
face
and
getting
soap
in
my
eyes
and
mother
hanging
a
little
green
bag
with
my
first
book
in
it
around
my
neck
so
i
would
not
lose
it
and
its
blowing
back
in
the
like
a
flag
but
before
i
was
sent
to
school
my
grandfather
as
i
was
told
had
taught
me
my
letters
from
shop
signs
across
the
street
i
can
remember
distinctly
how
proud
i
was
when
i
had
spelled
my
way
through
the
little
first
book
into
the
second
which
seemed
large
and
important
and
so
on
to
the
third
going
from
one
book
to
another
formed
a
grand
triumphal
advancement
the
memories
of
which
still
stand
out
in
clear
relief
the
third
book
contained
interesting
stories
as
well
as
plain
to
me
the
best
story
of
all
was
llewellyn
dog
the
first
animal
that
comes
to
mind
after
the
field
mouse
it
so
deeply
interested
and
touched
me
and
some
of
my
classmates
that
we
read
it
over
and
over
with
aching
hearts
both
in
and
out
of
school
and
shed
bitter
tears
over
the
brave
faithful
dog
gelert
slain
by
his
own
master
who
imagined
that
he
had
devoured
his
son
because
he
came
to
him
all
bloody
when
the
boy
was
lost
though
he
had
saved
the
child
life
by
killing
a
big
wolf
we
have
to
look
far
back
to
learn
how
great
may
be
the
capacity
of
a
child
heart
for
sorrow
and
sympathy
with
animals
as
well
as
with
human
friends
and
neighbors
this
story
stands
out
in
the
throng
of
old
schoolday
memories
as
clearly
as
if
i
had
myself
been
one
of
that
welsh
heard
the
bugles
blowing
seen
gelert
slain
joined
in
the
search
for
the
lost
child
discovered
it
at
last
happy
and
smiling
among
the
grass
and
bushes
beside
the
dead
mangled
wolf
and
wept
with
llewellyn
over
the
sad
fate
of
his
noble
faithful
dog
friend
another
favorite
in
this
book
was
southey
poem
the
inchcape
bell
a
story
of
a
priest
and
a
pirate
a
good
priest
in
order
to
warn
seamen
in
dark
stormy
weather
hung
a
big
bell
on
the
dangerous
inchcape
rock
the
greater
the
storm
and
higher
the
waves
the
louder
rang
the
warning
bell
until
it
was
cut
off
and
sunk
by
wicked
ralph
the
rover
one
fine
day
as
the
story
goes
when
the
bell
was
ringing
gently
the
pirate
put
out
to
the
rock
saying
i
sink
that
bell
and
plague
the
abbot
of
aberbrothok
so
he
cut
the
rope
and
down
went
the
bell
with
a
gurgling
sound
the
bubbles
rose
and
burst
around
etc
then
ralph
the
rover
sailed
away
he
scoured
the
seas
for
many
a
day
and
now
grown
rich
with
plundered
store
he
steers
his
course
for
scotland
shore
then
came
a
terrible
storm
with
cloud
darkness
and
night
darkness
and
high
roaring
waves
now
where
we
are
cried
the
pirate
i
can
not
tell
but
i
wish
i
could
hear
the
inchcape
bell
and
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
how
the
wretched
rover
tore
his
hair
and
curst
himself
in
his
despair
when
with
a
shivering
shock
the
stout
ship
struck
on
the
inchcape
rock
and
went
down
with
ralph
and
his
plunder
beside
the
good
priest
bell
the
story
appealed
to
our
love
of
kind
deeds
and
of
wildness
and
fair
play
a
lot
of
terrifying
experiences
connected
with
these
first
schooldays
grew
out
of
crimes
committed
by
the
keeper
of
a
low
in
edinburgh
who
allowed
poor
homeless
wretches
to
sleep
on
benches
or
the
floor
for
a
penny
or
so
a
night
and
when
kind
death
came
to
their
relief
sold
the
bodies
for
dissection
to
hare
of
the
medical
school
none
of
us
children
ever
heard
anything
like
the
original
story
the
servant
girls
told
us
that
dandy
doctors
clad
in
long
black
cloaks
and
supplied
with
a
store
of
of
wondrous
adhesiveness
prowled
at
night
about
the
country
lanes
and
even
the
town
streets
watching
for
children
to
choke
and
sell
the
dandy
doctor
business
method
as
the
servants
explained
it
was
with
lightning
quickness
to
clap
a
on
the
face
of
a
scholar
covering
mouth
and
nose
preventing
breathing
or
crying
for
help
then
pop
us
under
his
long
black
cloak
and
carry
us
to
edinburgh
to
be
sold
and
sliced
into
small
pieces
for
folk
to
learn
how
we
were
made
we
always
mentioned
the
name
dandy
doctor
in
a
fearful
whisper
and
never
dared
venture
out
of
doors
after
dark
in
the
short
winter
days
it
got
dark
before
school
closed
and
in
cloudy
weather
we
sometimes
had
difficulty
in
finding
our
way
home
unless
a
servant
with
a
lantern
was
sent
for
us
but
during
the
dandy
doctor
period
the
school
was
closed
earlier
for
if
detained
until
the
usual
hour
the
teacher
could
not
get
us
to
leave
the
schoolroom
we
would
rather
stay
all
night
supperless
than
dare
the
mysterious
doctors
supposed
to
be
lying
in
wait
for
us
we
had
to
go
up
a
hill
called
the
davel
brae
that
lay
between
the
schoolhouse
and
the
main
street
one
evening
just
before
dark
as
we
were
running
up
the
hill
one
of
the
boys
shouted
a
dandy
doctor
a
dandy
doctor
and
we
all
fled
pellmell
back
into
the
schoolhouse
to
the
astonishment
of
mungo
siddons
the
teacher
i
can
remember
to
this
day
the
amused
look
on
the
good
dominie
face
as
he
stared
and
tried
to
guess
what
had
got
into
us
until
one
of
the
older
boys
breathlessly
explained
that
there
was
an
awful
big
dandy
doctor
on
the
brae
and
we
couldna
gang
hame
others
corroborated
the
dreadful
news
yes
we
saw
him
plain
as
onything
with
his
lang
black
cloak
to
hide
us
in
and
some
of
us
thought
we
saw
a
ready
in
his
hand
we
were
in
such
a
state
of
fear
and
trembling
that
the
teacher
saw
he
was
going
to
get
rid
of
us
without
going
himself
as
leader
he
went
only
a
short
distance
however
and
turned
us
over
to
the
care
of
the
two
biggest
scholars
who
led
us
to
the
top
of
the
brae
and
then
left
us
to
scurry
home
and
dash
into
the
door
like
pursued
squirrels
diving
into
their
holes
just
before
school
skaled
closed
we
all
arose
and
sang
the
fine
hymn
lord
dismiss
us
with
thy
blessing
in
the
spring
when
the
swallows
were
coming
back
from
their
winter
homes
we
sang
welcome
welcome
little
stranger
welcome
from
a
foreign
shore
safe
escaped
from
many
a
danger
and
while
singing
we
all
swayed
in
rhythm
with
the
music
the
cuckoo
that
always
told
his
name
in
the
spring
of
the
year
was
another
favorite
song
and
when
there
was
nothing
in
particular
to
call
to
mind
any
special
bird
or
animal
the
songs
we
sang
were
widely
varied
such
as
the
whale
the
whale
is
the
beast
for
me
plunging
along
through
the
deep
deep
sea
but
the
best
of
all
was
lord
dismiss
us
with
thy
blessing
though
at
that
time
the
most
significant
part
i
fear
was
the
first
three
words
with
my
school
lessons
father
made
me
learn
hymns
and
bible
verses
for
learning
rock
of
ages
he
gave
me
a
penny
and
i
thus
became
suddenly
rich
scotch
boys
are
seldom
spoiled
with
money
we
thought
more
of
a
penny
those
economical
days
than
the
poorest
american
schoolboy
thinks
of
a
dollar
to
decide
what
to
do
with
that
first
penny
was
an
extravagantly
serious
affair
i
ran
in
great
excitement
up
and
down
the
street
examining
the
tempting
goodies
in
the
shop
windows
before
venturing
on
so
important
an
investment
my
playmates
also
became
excited
when
the
wonderful
news
got
abroad
that
johnnie
muir
had
a
penny
hoping
to
obtain
a
taste
of
the
orange
apple
or
candy
it
was
likely
to
bring
forth
at
this
time
infants
were
baptized
and
vaccinated
a
few
days
after
birth
i
remember
very
well
a
fight
with
the
doctor
when
my
brother
david
was
vaccinated
this
happened
i
think
before
i
was
sent
to
school
i
could
imagine
what
the
doctor
a
tall
man
in
black
was
doing
to
my
brother
but
as
mother
who
was
holding
him
in
her
arms
offered
no
objection
i
looked
on
quietly
while
he
scratched
the
arm
until
i
saw
blood
then
unable
to
trust
even
my
mother
i
managed
to
spring
up
high
enough
to
grab
and
bite
the
doctor
arm
yelling
that
i
wasna
gan
to
let
him
hurt
my
bonnie
brither
while
to
my
utter
astonishment
mother
and
the
doctor
only
laughed
at
me
so
far
from
complete
at
times
is
sympathy
between
parents
and
children
and
so
much
like
wild
beasts
are
baby
boys
little
fighting
biting
climbing
pagans
father
was
proud
of
his
garden
and
seemed
always
to
be
trying
to
make
it
as
much
like
eden
as
possible
and
in
a
corner
of
it
he
gave
each
of
us
a
little
bit
of
ground
for
our
very
own
in
which
we
planted
what
we
best
liked
wondering
how
the
hard
dry
seeds
could
change
into
soft
leaves
and
flowers
and
find
their
way
out
to
the
light
and
to
see
how
they
were
coming
on
we
used
to
dig
up
the
larger
ones
such
as
peas
and
beans
every
day
my
aunt
had
a
corner
assigned
to
her
in
our
garden
which
she
filled
with
lilies
and
we
all
looked
with
the
utmost
respect
and
admiration
at
that
precious
and
wondered
whether
when
we
grew
up
we
should
ever
be
rich
enough
to
own
one
anything
like
so
grand
we
imagined
that
each
lily
was
worth
an
enormous
sum
of
money
and
never
dared
to
touch
a
single
leaf
or
petal
of
them
we
really
stood
in
awe
of
them
far
far
was
i
then
from
the
wild
lily
gardens
of
california
that
i
was
destined
to
see
in
their
glory
when
i
was
a
little
boy
at
mungo
siddons
school
a
was
held
in
dunbar
and
i
saw
a
number
of
the
exhibitors
carrying
large
handfuls
of
dahlias
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
i
thought
them
marvelous
in
size
and
beauty
and
as
in
the
case
of
my
aunt
lilies
wondered
if
i
should
ever
be
rich
enough
to
own
some
of
them
although
i
never
dared
to
touch
my
aunt
sacred
lilies
i
have
good
cause
to
remember
stealing
some
common
flowers
from
an
apothecary
peter
lawson
who
also
answered
the
purpose
of
a
regular
physician
to
most
of
the
poor
people
of
the
town
and
adjacent
country
he
had
a
pony
which
was
considered
very
wild
and
dangerous
and
when
he
was
called
out
of
town
he
mounted
this
wonderful
beast
which
after
standing
long
in
the
stable
was
frisky
and
boisterous
and
often
to
our
delight
reared
and
jumped
and
danced
about
from
side
to
side
of
the
street
before
he
could
be
persuaded
to
go
ahead
we
boys
gazed
in
awful
admiration
and
wondered
how
the
druggist
could
be
so
brave
and
able
as
to
get
on
and
stay
on
that
wild
beast
back
this
famous
peter
loved
the
flowers
and
had
a
fine
garden
surrounded
by
an
iron
fence
through
the
bars
of
which
when
i
thought
no
one
saw
me
i
oftentimes
snatched
a
flower
and
took
to
my
heels
one
day
peter
discovered
me
in
this
mischief
dashed
out
into
the
street
and
caught
me
i
screamed
that
i
wouldna
steal
any
more
if
he
would
let
me
go
he
did
say
anything
but
just
dragged
me
along
to
the
stable
where
he
kept
the
wild
pony
pushed
me
in
right
back
of
its
heels
and
shut
the
door
i
was
screaming
of
course
but
as
soon
as
i
was
imprisoned
the
fear
of
being
kicked
quenched
all
noise
i
hardly
dared
breathe
my
only
hope
was
in
motionless
silence
imagine
the
agony
i
endured
i
did
not
steal
any
more
of
his
flowers
he
was
a
good
hard
judge
of
boy
nature
i
was
in
peter
hands
some
time
before
this
when
i
was
about
two
and
a
half
years
old
the
servant
girl
bathed
us
small
folk
before
putting
us
to
bed
the
smarting
soapy
scrubbings
of
the
saturday
nights
in
preparation
for
the
sabbath
were
particularly
severe
and
we
all
dreaded
them
my
sister
sarah
the
next
older
than
me
wanted
the
stool
i
was
sitting
on
awaiting
my
turn
so
she
just
tipped
me
off
my
chin
struck
on
the
edge
of
the
and
as
i
was
talking
at
the
time
my
tongue
happened
to
be
in
the
way
of
my
teeth
when
they
were
closed
by
the
blow
and
a
deep
gash
was
cut
on
the
side
of
it
which
bled
profusely
mother
came
running
at
the
noise
i
made
wrapped
me
up
put
me
in
the
servant
girl
arms
and
told
her
to
run
with
me
through
the
garden
and
out
by
a
back
way
to
peter
lawson
to
have
something
done
to
stop
the
bleeding
he
simply
pushed
a
wad
of
cotton
into
my
mouth
after
soaking
it
in
some
brown
astringent
stuff
and
told
me
to
be
sure
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
all
would
soon
be
well
mother
put
me
to
bed
calmed
my
fears
and
told
me
to
lie
still
and
sleep
like
a
gude
bairn
but
just
as
i
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
i
swallowed
the
bulky
wad
of
medicated
cotton
and
with
it
as
i
imagined
my
tongue
also
my
screams
over
so
great
a
loss
brought
mother
and
when
she
anxiously
took
me
in
her
arms
and
inquired
what
was
the
matter
i
told
her
that
i
had
swallowed
my
tongue
she
only
laughed
at
me
much
to
my
astonishment
when
i
expected
that
she
would
bewail
the
awful
loss
her
boy
had
sustained
my
sisters
who
were
older
than
i
oftentimes
said
when
i
happened
to
be
talking
too
much
it
a
pity
you
had
swallowed
at
least
half
of
that
long
tongue
of
yours
when
you
were
little
it
appears
natural
for
children
to
be
fond
of
water
although
the
scotch
method
of
making
every
duty
dismal
contrived
to
make
necessary
bathing
for
health
terrible
to
us
i
well
remember
among
the
awful
experiences
of
childhood
being
taken
by
the
servant
to
the
seashore
when
i
was
between
two
and
three
years
old
stripped
at
the
side
of
a
deep
pool
in
the
rocks
plunged
into
it
among
crawling
crawfish
and
slippery
wriggling
eels
and
drawn
up
gasping
and
shrieking
only
to
be
plunged
down
again
and
again
as
the
time
approached
for
this
terrible
bathing
i
used
to
hide
in
darkest
corners
of
the
house
and
oftentimes
a
long
search
was
required
to
find
me
but
after
we
were
a
few
years
older
we
enjoyed
bathing
with
other
boys
as
we
wandered
along
the
shore
careful
however
not
to
get
into
a
pool
that
had
an
invisible
monster
at
the
bottom
of
it
such
pools
miniature
maelstroms
were
called
and
were
well
known
to
most
of
us
nevertheless
we
never
ventured
into
any
pool
on
strange
parts
of
the
coast
before
we
had
thrust
a
stick
into
it
if
the
stick
were
not
pulled
out
of
our
hands
we
boldly
entered
and
enjoyed
plashing
and
ducking
long
ere
we
had
learned
to
swim
one
of
our
best
playgrounds
was
the
famous
old
dunbar
castle
to
which
king
edward
fled
after
his
defeat
at
bannockburn
it
was
built
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
though
we
knew
little
of
its
history
we
had
heard
many
mysterious
stories
of
the
battles
fought
about
its
walls
and
firmly
believed
that
every
bone
we
found
in
the
ruins
belonged
to
an
ancient
warrior
we
tried
to
see
who
could
climb
highest
on
the
crumbling
peaks
and
crags
and
took
chances
that
no
cautious
mountaineer
would
try
that
i
did
not
fall
and
finish
my
in
those
adventurous
boyhood
days
seems
now
a
reasonable
wonder
among
our
best
games
were
running
jumping
wrestling
and
scrambling
i
was
so
proud
of
my
skill
as
a
climber
that
when
i
first
heard
of
hell
from
a
servant
girl
who
loved
to
tell
its
horrors
and
warn
us
that
if
we
did
anything
wrong
we
would
be
cast
into
it
i
always
insisted
that
i
could
climb
out
of
it
i
imagined
it
was
only
a
sooty
pit
with
stone
walls
like
those
of
the
castle
and
i
felt
sure
there
must
be
chinks
and
cracks
in
the
masonry
for
fingers
and
toes
anyhow
the
terrors
of
the
horrible
place
seldom
lasted
long
beyond
the
telling
for
natural
faith
casts
out
fear
most
of
the
scotch
children
believe
in
ghosts
and
some
under
peculiar
conditions
continue
to
believe
in
them
all
through
life
grave
ghosts
are
deemed
particularly
dangerous
and
many
of
the
most
credulous
will
go
far
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
passing
through
or
near
a
graveyard
in
the
dark
after
being
instructed
by
the
servants
in
the
nature
looks
and
habits
of
the
various
black
and
white
ghosts
boowuzzies
and
witches
we
often
speculated
as
to
whether
they
could
run
fast
and
tried
to
believe
that
we
had
a
good
chance
to
get
away
from
most
of
them
to
improve
our
speed
and
wind
we
often
took
long
runs
into
the
country
tam
o
shanter
mare
outran
a
lot
of
witches
at
least
until
she
reached
a
place
of
safety
beyond
the
keystone
of
the
bridge
and
we
thought
perhaps
we
also
might
be
able
to
outrun
them
our
house
formerly
belonged
to
a
physician
and
a
servant
girl
told
us
that
the
ghost
of
the
dead
doctor
haunted
one
of
the
unoccupied
rooms
in
the
second
story
that
was
kept
dark
on
account
of
a
heavy
our
bedroom
was
adjacent
to
the
ghost
room
which
had
in
it
a
lot
of
chemical
apparatus
glass
tubing
glass
and
brass
retorts
flasks
and
we
thought
that
those
strange
articles
were
still
used
by
the
old
dead
doctor
in
compounding
physic
in
the
long
summer
days
david
and
i
were
put
to
bed
several
hours
before
sunset
mother
tucked
us
in
carefully
drew
the
curtains
of
the
big
bed
and
told
us
to
lie
still
and
sleep
like
gude
bairns
but
we
were
usually
out
of
bed
playing
games
of
daring
called
scootchers
about
as
soon
as
our
loving
mother
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
for
we
could
lie
still
however
hard
we
might
try
going
into
the
ghost
room
was
regarded
as
a
very
great
scootcher
after
venturing
in
a
few
steps
and
rushing
back
in
terror
i
used
to
dare
david
to
go
as
far
without
getting
caught
the
roof
of
our
house
as
well
as
the
crags
and
walls
of
the
old
castle
offered
fine
mountaineering
exercise
our
bedroom
was
lighted
by
a
dormer
window
one
night
i
opened
it
in
search
of
good
scootchers
and
hung
myself
out
over
the
slates
holding
on
to
the
sill
while
the
wind
was
making
a
balloon
of
my
nightgown
i
then
dared
david
to
try
the
adventure
and
he
did
then
i
went
out
again
and
hung
by
one
hand
and
david
did
the
same
then
i
hung
by
one
finger
being
careful
not
to
slip
and
he
did
that
too
then
i
stood
on
the
sill
and
examined
the
edge
of
the
left
wall
of
the
window
crept
up
the
slates
along
its
side
by
slight
got
astride
of
the
roof
sat
there
a
few
minutes
looking
at
the
scenery
over
the
garden
wall
while
the
wind
was
howling
and
threatening
to
blow
me
off
then
managed
to
slip
down
catch
hold
of
the
sill
and
get
safely
back
into
the
room
but
before
attempting
this
scootcher
recognizing
its
dangerous
character
with
commendable
caution
i
warned
david
that
in
case
i
should
happen
to
slip
i
would
grip
the
when
i
was
going
over
the
eaves
and
hang
on
and
that
he
must
then
run
fast
downstairs
and
tell
father
to
get
a
ladder
for
me
and
tell
him
to
be
quick
because
i
would
soon
be
tired
hanging
dangling
in
the
wind
by
my
hands
after
my
return
from
this
capital
scootcher
david
not
to
be
outdone
crawled
up
to
the
top
of
the
and
got
bravely
astride
of
it
but
in
trying
to
return
he
lost
courage
and
began
to
greet
to
cry
i
canna
get
doon
oh
i
canna
get
doon
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
shouted
encouragingly
dinna
greet
davie
dinna
greet
i
help
ye
doon
if
you
greet
fayther
will
hear
and
gee
us
baith
an
awfu
skelping
then
standing
on
the
sill
and
holding
on
by
one
hand
to
the
i
directed
him
to
slip
his
feet
down
within
reach
and
after
securing
a
good
hold
i
jumped
inside
and
dragged
him
in
by
his
heels
this
finished
for
the
night
and
frightened
us
into
bed
in
the
short
winter
days
when
it
was
dark
even
at
our
early
bedtime
we
usually
spent
the
hours
before
going
to
sleep
playing
voyages
around
the
world
under
the
after
mother
had
carefully
covered
us
bade
us
and
gone
downstairs
we
set
out
on
our
travels
burrowing
like
moles
we
visited
france
india
america
australia
new
zealand
and
all
the
places
we
had
ever
heard
of
our
travels
never
ending
until
we
fell
asleep
when
mother
came
to
take
a
last
look
at
us
before
she
went
to
bed
to
see
that
we
were
covered
we
were
oftentimes
covered
so
well
that
she
had
difficulty
in
finding
us
for
we
were
hidden
in
all
sorts
of
positions
where
sleep
happened
to
overtake
us
but
in
the
morning
we
always
found
ourselves
in
good
order
lying
straight
like
gude
bairns
as
she
said
some
fifty
years
later
when
i
visited
scotland
i
got
one
of
my
dunbar
schoolmates
to
introduce
me
to
the
owners
of
our
old
home
from
whom
i
obtained
permission
to
go
upstairs
to
examine
our
bedroom
window
and
judge
what
sort
of
adventure
getting
on
its
roof
must
have
been
and
with
all
my
after
experience
in
mountaineering
i
found
that
what
i
had
done
in
daring
boyhood
was
now
beyond
my
skill
boys
are
often
at
once
cruel
and
merciful
thoughtlessly
and
sympathetic
pitiful
and
kind
in
ever
changing
contrasts
love
of
neighbors
human
or
animal
grows
up
amid
savage
traits
coarse
and
fine
when
father
made
out
to
get
us
securely
locked
up
in
the
back
yard
to
prevent
our
shore
and
field
wanderings
we
had
to
play
away
the
comparatively
dull
time
as
best
we
could
one
of
our
amusements
was
hunting
cats
without
seriously
hurting
them
these
sagacious
animals
knew
however
that
though
not
very
dangerous
boys
were
not
to
be
trusted
one
time
in
particular
i
remember
when
we
began
throwing
stones
at
an
experienced
old
tom
not
wishing
to
hurt
him
much
though
he
was
a
tempting
mark
he
soon
saw
what
we
were
up
to
fled
to
the
stable
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
hay
manger
he
was
still
within
range
however
and
we
kept
the
stones
flying
faster
and
faster
but
he
just
blinked
and
played
possum
without
wincing
either
at
our
best
shots
or
at
the
noise
we
made
i
happened
to
strike
him
pretty
hard
with
a
pebble
but
he
still
blinked
and
sat
still
as
if
without
feeling
he
must
be
mortally
wounded
i
said
and
now
we
must
kill
him
to
put
him
out
of
pain
the
savage
in
us
rapidly
growing
with
indulgence
all
took
heartily
to
this
sort
of
cat
mercy
and
began
throwing
the
heaviest
stones
we
could
manage
but
that
old
fellow
knew
what
characters
we
were
and
just
as
we
imagined
him
mercifully
dead
he
evidently
thought
the
play
was
becoming
too
serious
and
that
it
was
time
to
retreat
for
suddenly
with
a
wild
whirr
and
gurr
of
energy
he
launched
himself
over
our
heads
rushed
across
the
yard
in
a
blur
of
speed
climbed
to
the
roof
of
another
building
and
over
the
garden
wall
out
of
pain
and
bad
company
with
all
his
lives
wideawake
and
in
good
working
order
after
we
had
thus
learned
that
tom
had
at
least
nine
lives
we
tried
to
verify
the
common
saying
that
no
matter
how
far
cats
fell
they
always
landed
on
their
feet
unhurt
we
caught
one
in
our
back
yard
not
tom
but
a
smaller
one
of
manageable
size
and
somehow
got
him
smuggled
up
to
the
top
story
of
the
house
i
do
know
how
in
the
world
we
managed
to
let
go
of
him
for
as
soon
as
we
opened
the
window
and
held
him
over
the
sill
he
knew
his
danger
and
made
violent
efforts
to
scratch
and
bite
his
way
back
into
the
room
but
we
determined
to
carry
the
thing
through
and
at
last
managed
to
drop
him
i
can
remember
to
this
day
how
the
poor
creature
in
danger
of
his
life
strained
and
balanced
as
he
was
falling
and
managed
to
alight
on
his
feet
this
was
a
cruel
thing
for
even
wild
boys
to
do
and
we
never
tried
the
experiment
again
for
we
sincerely
pitied
the
poor
fellow
when
we
saw
him
creeping
slowly
away
stunned
and
frightened
with
a
swollen
black
and
blue
chin
again
showing
the
natural
savagery
of
boys
we
delighted
in
and
even
in
the
horrid
red
work
of
often
running
long
distances
and
climbing
over
walls
and
roofs
to
see
a
pig
killed
as
soon
as
we
heard
the
desperately
earnest
squealing
and
if
the
butcher
was
we
begged
him
to
let
us
get
a
near
view
of
the
mysterious
insides
and
to
give
us
a
bladder
to
blow
up
for
a
but
here
is
an
illustration
of
the
better
side
of
boy
nature
in
our
back
yard
there
were
three
elm
trees
and
in
the
one
nearest
the
house
a
pair
of
had
their
nest
when
the
young
were
almost
able
to
fly
a
troop
of
the
celebrated
scottish
grays
visited
dunbar
and
three
or
four
of
the
fine
horses
were
lodged
in
our
stable
when
the
soldiers
were
polishing
their
swords
and
helmets
they
happened
to
notice
the
nest
and
just
as
they
were
leaving
one
of
them
climbed
the
tree
and
robbed
it
with
sore
sympathy
we
watched
the
young
birds
as
the
robber
pushed
them
one
by
one
beneath
his
jacket
all
but
two
that
jumped
out
of
the
nest
and
tried
to
fly
but
they
were
easily
caught
as
they
fluttered
on
the
ground
and
were
hidden
away
with
the
rest
the
distress
of
the
bereaved
parents
as
they
hovered
and
screamed
over
the
frightened
crying
children
they
so
long
had
loved
and
sheltered
and
fed
was
pitiful
to
see
but
the
shining
soldier
rode
grandly
away
on
his
big
gray
horse
caring
only
for
the
few
pennies
the
young
songbirds
would
bring
and
the
beer
they
would
buy
while
we
all
sisters
and
brothers
were
crying
and
sobbing
i
remember
as
if
it
happened
this
day
how
my
heart
fairly
ached
and
choked
me
mother
put
us
to
bed
and
tried
to
comfort
us
telling
us
that
the
little
birds
would
be
well
fed
and
grow
big
and
soon
learn
to
sing
in
pretty
cages
but
again
and
again
we
rehearsed
the
sad
story
of
the
poor
bereaved
birds
and
their
frightened
children
and
could
not
be
comforted
father
came
into
the
room
when
we
were
half
asleep
and
still
sobbing
and
i
heard
mother
telling
him
that
a
the
bairns
hearts
were
broken
over
the
robbing
of
the
nest
in
the
elm
after
attaining
the
manly
belligerent
age
of
five
or
six
years
very
few
of
my
schooldays
passed
without
a
fist
fight
and
half
a
dozen
was
no
uncommon
number
when
any
classmate
of
our
own
age
questioned
our
rank
and
standing
as
fighters
we
always
made
haste
to
settle
the
matter
at
a
quiet
place
on
the
davel
brae
to
be
a
gude
fechter
was
our
highest
ambition
our
dearest
aim
in
life
in
or
out
of
school
to
be
a
good
scholar
was
a
secondary
consideration
though
we
tried
hard
to
hold
high
places
in
our
classes
and
gloried
in
being
dux
we
fairly
reveled
in
the
battle
stories
of
glorious
william
wallace
and
robert
the
bruce
with
which
every
breath
of
scotch
air
is
saturated
and
of
course
we
were
all
going
to
be
soldiers
on
the
davel
brae
battleground
we
often
managed
to
bring
on
something
like
real
war
greatly
more
exciting
than
personal
combat
choosing
leaders
we
divided
into
two
armies
in
winter
damp
snow
furnished
plenty
of
ammunition
to
make
the
thing
serious
and
in
summer
sand
and
grass
sods
cheering
and
shouting
some
such
as
bannockburn
bannockburn
scotland
forever
the
last
war
in
india
we
were
led
bravely
on
for
heavy
battery
work
we
stuffed
our
scotch
blue
bonnets
with
snow
and
sand
sometimes
mixed
with
gravel
and
fired
them
at
each
other
as
of
course
we
always
looked
eagerly
forward
to
vacation
days
and
thought
them
slow
in
coming
old
mungo
siddons
gave
us
a
lot
of
gooseberries
or
currants
and
wished
us
a
happy
time
some
sort
of
special
singing
recitations
celebrated
the
great
day
but
i
remember
only
the
berries
freedom
from
school
work
and
opportunities
for
rambles
in
the
fields
and
along
the
seashore
an
exciting
time
came
when
at
the
age
of
seven
or
eight
years
i
left
the
auld
davel
brae
school
for
the
grammar
school
of
course
i
had
a
terrible
lot
of
fighting
to
do
because
a
new
scholar
had
to
meet
every
one
of
his
age
who
dared
to
challenge
him
this
being
the
common
introduction
to
a
new
school
it
was
very
strenuous
for
the
first
month
or
so
establishing
my
fighting
rank
taking
up
new
studies
especially
latin
and
french
getting
acquainted
with
new
classmates
and
the
master
and
his
rules
in
the
first
few
latin
and
french
lessons
the
new
teacher
lyon
blandly
smiled
at
our
comical
blunders
but
pedagogical
weather
of
the
severest
kind
quickly
set
in
when
for
every
mistake
everything
short
of
perfection
the
taws
was
promptly
applied
we
had
to
get
three
lessons
every
day
in
latin
three
in
french
and
as
many
in
english
besides
spelling
history
arithmetic
and
geography
word
lessons
in
particular
the
kind
were
kept
up
with
much
warlike
thrashing
until
i
had
committed
the
whole
of
the
french
latin
and
english
grammars
to
memory
and
in
connection
with
we
were
called
on
to
recite
parts
of
them
with
the
rules
over
and
over
again
as
if
all
the
regular
and
irregular
incomprehensible
verb
stuff
was
poetry
in
addition
to
all
this
father
made
me
learn
so
many
bible
verses
every
day
that
by
the
time
i
was
eleven
years
of
age
i
had
about
three
fourths
of
the
old
testament
and
all
of
the
new
by
heart
and
by
sore
flesh
i
could
recite
the
new
testament
from
the
beginning
of
matthew
to
the
end
of
revelation
without
a
single
stop
the
dangers
of
cramming
and
of
making
scholars
study
at
home
instead
of
letting
their
little
brains
rest
were
never
heard
of
in
those
days
we
carried
our
home
in
a
strap
every
night
and
committed
to
memory
our
next
day
lessons
before
we
went
to
bed
and
to
do
that
we
had
to
bend
our
attention
as
closely
on
our
tasks
as
lawyers
on
great
cases
i
ca
conceive
of
anything
that
would
now
enable
me
to
concentrate
my
attention
more
fully
than
when
i
was
a
mere
stripling
boy
and
it
was
all
done
by
whipping
thrashing
in
general
scotch
teachers
spent
no
time
in
seeking
short
roads
to
knowledge
or
in
trying
any
of
the
psychological
methods
so
much
in
vogue
nowadays
there
was
nothing
said
about
making
the
seats
easy
or
the
lessons
easy
we
were
simply
driven
pointblank
against
our
books
like
soldiers
against
the
enemy
and
sternly
ordered
up
and
at
commit
your
lessons
to
memory
if
we
failed
in
any
part
however
slight
we
were
whipped
for
the
grand
simple
scotch
discovery
had
been
made
that
there
was
a
close
connection
between
the
skin
and
the
memory
and
that
irritating
the
skin
excited
the
memory
to
any
required
degree
fighting
was
carried
on
still
more
vigorously
in
the
high
school
than
in
the
common
school
whenever
any
one
was
challenged
either
the
challenge
was
allowed
or
it
was
decided
by
a
battle
on
the
seashore
where
with
stubborn
enthusiasm
we
battered
each
other
as
if
we
had
not
been
sufficiently
battered
by
the
teacher
when
we
were
so
fortunate
as
to
finish
a
fight
without
getting
a
black
eye
we
usually
escaped
a
thrashing
at
home
and
another
next
morning
at
school
for
other
traces
of
the
fray
could
be
easily
washed
off
at
a
well
on
the
church
brae
or
concealed
or
passed
as
results
of
playground
accidents
but
a
black
eye
could
never
be
explained
away
from
downright
fighting
a
good
double
thrashing
was
the
inevitable
penalty
but
all
without
avail
fighting
went
on
without
the
slightest
abatement
like
natural
storms
for
no
punishment
less
than
death
could
quench
the
ancient
inherited
belligerence
burning
in
our
pagan
blood
nor
could
we
be
made
to
believe
it
was
fair
that
father
and
teacher
should
thrash
us
so
industriously
for
our
good
while
begrudging
us
the
pleasure
of
thrashing
each
other
for
our
good
all
these
various
thrashings
however
were
admirably
influential
in
developing
not
only
memory
but
fortitude
as
well
for
if
we
did
not
endure
our
school
punishments
and
fighting
pains
without
flinching
and
making
faces
we
were
mocked
on
the
playground
and
public
opinion
on
a
scotch
playground
was
a
powerful
agent
in
controlling
behavior
therefore
we
at
length
managed
to
keep
our
features
in
smooth
repose
while
enduring
pain
that
would
try
anybody
but
an
american
indian
far
from
feeling
that
we
were
called
on
to
endure
too
much
pain
one
of
our
playground
games
was
thrashing
each
other
with
whips
about
two
feet
long
made
from
the
tough
wiry
stems
of
a
species
of
polygonum
fastened
together
in
a
stiff
firm
braid
one
of
us
handing
two
of
these
whips
to
a
companion
to
take
his
choice
we
stood
up
close
together
and
thrashed
each
other
on
the
legs
until
one
succumbed
to
the
intolerable
pain
and
thus
lost
the
game
nearly
all
of
our
playground
games
were
strenuous
shinny
wrestling
prisoners
base
and
dogs
and
hares
all
augmenting
in
no
slight
degree
our
lessons
in
fortitude
moreover
we
regarded
our
punishments
and
pains
of
every
sort
as
training
for
war
since
we
were
all
going
to
be
soldiers
besides
single
combats
we
sometimes
assembled
on
saturdays
to
meet
the
scholars
of
another
school
and
very
little
was
required
for
the
growth
of
strained
relations
and
war
the
immediate
cause
might
be
nothing
more
than
a
saucy
stare
perhaps
the
scholar
stared
at
would
insolently
inquire
what
are
ye
glowerin
at
bob
bob
would
reply
i
look
where
i
hae
a
mind
and
hinder
me
if
ye
daur
weel
bob
the
outraged
scholar
would
reply
i
soon
let
ye
see
whether
i
daur
or
no
and
give
bob
a
blow
on
the
face
this
opened
the
battle
and
every
good
scholar
belonging
to
either
school
was
drawn
into
it
after
both
sides
were
sore
and
weary
a
warrior
would
be
heard
above
the
din
of
battle
shouting
i
tell
ye
what
we
dae
wi
ye
if
ye
let
us
alane
we
let
ye
alane
and
the
school
war
ended
as
most
wars
between
nations
do
and
some
of
them
begin
in
much
the
same
way
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
harshly
enforced
rules
not
very
good
order
was
kept
in
school
in
my
time
there
were
two
schools
within
a
few
rods
of
each
other
one
for
mathematics
navigation
the
other
called
the
grammar
school
that
i
attended
the
masters
lived
in
a
big
freestone
house
within
eight
or
ten
yards
of
the
schools
so
that
they
could
easily
step
out
for
anything
they
wanted
or
send
one
of
the
scholars
the
moment
our
master
disappeared
perhaps
for
a
book
or
a
drink
every
scholar
left
his
seat
and
his
lessons
jumped
on
top
of
the
benches
and
desks
or
crawled
beneath
them
tugging
rolling
wrestling
accomplishing
in
a
minute
a
depth
of
disorder
and
din
unbelievable
save
by
a
scottish
scholar
we
even
carried
on
war
class
against
class
in
those
wild
precious
minutes
a
watcher
gave
the
alarm
when
the
master
opened
his
to
return
and
it
was
a
great
feat
to
get
into
our
places
before
he
entered
adorned
in
awful
majestic
authority
shouting
silence
and
striking
resounding
blows
with
his
cane
on
a
desk
or
on
some
unfortunate
scholar
back
years
after
leaving
this
fighting
school
i
returned
on
a
visit
to
scotland
and
a
cousin
in
dunbar
introduced
me
to
a
minister
who
was
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
school
and
obtained
for
me
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
new
master
of
course
i
gladly
accepted
for
i
wanted
to
see
the
old
place
of
fun
and
pain
and
the
battleground
on
the
sands
lyon
our
able
teacher
and
thrasher
i
learned
had
held
his
place
as
master
of
the
school
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
after
i
left
it
and
had
recently
died
in
london
after
preparing
many
young
men
for
the
english
universities
at
the
while
i
was
recalling
the
amusements
and
fights
of
my
old
schooldays
the
minister
remarked
to
the
new
master
now
you
wish
that
you
had
been
teacher
in
those
days
and
gained
the
honor
of
walloping
john
muir
this
pleasure
so
merrily
suggested
showed
that
the
minister
also
had
been
a
fighter
in
his
youth
the
old
freestone
school
building
was
still
perfectly
sound
but
the
carved
desks
were
almost
whittled
away
the
highest
part
of
our
playground
back
of
the
school
commanded
a
view
of
the
sea
and
we
loved
to
watch
the
passing
ships
and
judging
by
their
rigging
make
guesses
as
to
the
ports
they
had
sailed
from
those
to
which
they
were
bound
what
they
were
loaded
with
their
tonnage
etc
in
stormy
weather
they
were
all
smothered
in
clouds
and
spray
and
showers
of
salt
scud
torn
from
the
tops
of
the
waves
came
flying
over
the
playground
wall
in
those
tremendous
storms
many
a
brave
ship
foundered
or
was
tossed
and
smashed
on
the
rocky
shore
when
a
wreck
occurred
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
town
we
often
managed
by
running
fast
to
reach
it
and
pick
up
some
of
the
spoils
in
particular
i
remember
visiting
the
battered
fragments
of
an
unfortunate
brig
or
schooner
that
had
been
loaded
with
apples
and
finding
fine
unpitiful
sport
in
rushing
into
the
spent
waves
and
picking
up
the
fruit
from
the
frothy
seething
foam
all
our
were
extravagantly
illustrated
with
drawings
of
every
kind
of
and
every
boy
owned
some
sort
of
craft
whittled
from
a
block
of
wood
and
trimmed
with
infinite
pains
sloops
schooners
brigs
and
ships
with
their
sails
and
string
ropes
properly
adjusted
and
named
for
us
by
some
old
sailor
these
precious
toy
craft
with
lead
keels
we
learned
to
sail
on
a
pond
near
the
town
with
the
sails
set
at
the
proper
angle
to
the
wind
they
made
fast
straight
voyages
across
the
pond
to
boys
on
the
other
side
who
readjusted
the
sails
and
started
them
back
on
the
return
voyages
oftentimes
fleets
of
half
a
dozen
or
more
were
started
together
in
exciting
races
our
most
exciting
sport
however
was
playing
with
gunpowder
we
made
guns
out
of
mounted
them
on
sticks
of
any
shape
clubbed
our
pennies
together
for
powder
gleaned
pieces
of
lead
here
and
there
and
cut
them
into
slugs
and
while
one
aimed
another
applied
a
match
to
the
with
these
awful
weapons
we
wandered
along
the
beach
and
fired
at
the
gulls
and
as
they
passed
us
fortunately
we
never
hurt
any
of
them
that
we
knew
of
we
also
dug
holes
in
the
ground
put
in
a
handful
or
two
of
powder
tamped
it
well
around
a
fuse
made
of
a
and
reaching
cautiously
forward
touched
a
match
to
the
straw
this
we
called
making
earthquakes
oftentimes
we
went
home
with
singed
hair
and
faces
well
peppered
with
that
could
not
be
washed
out
then
of
course
came
a
correspondingly
severe
punishment
from
both
father
and
teacher
another
favorite
sport
was
climbing
trees
and
scaling
boys
eight
or
ten
years
of
age
could
get
over
almost
any
wall
by
standing
on
each
other
shoulders
thus
making
living
ladders
to
make
walls
secure
against
marauders
many
of
them
were
finished
on
top
with
broken
bottles
imbedded
in
lime
leaving
the
cutting
edges
sticking
up
but
with
bunches
of
grass
and
weeds
we
could
sit
or
stand
in
comfort
on
top
of
the
jaggedest
of
them
like
squirrels
that
begin
to
eat
nuts
before
they
are
ripe
we
began
to
eat
apples
about
as
soon
as
they
were
formed
causing
of
course
desperate
gastric
disturbances
to
be
cured
by
castor
oil
serious
were
the
risks
we
ran
in
climbing
and
squeezing
through
hedges
and
of
course
among
the
country
folk
we
were
far
from
welcome
farmers
passing
us
on
the
roads
often
shouted
by
way
of
greeting
oh
you
vagabonds
back
to
the
toon
wi
ye
gang
back
where
ye
belang
up
to
mischief
ise
warrant
i
can
see
it
the
gamekeeper
catch
ye
and
maist
like
ye
a
be
hanged
some
day
breakfast
in
those
days
was
simple
oatmeal
porridge
usually
with
a
little
milk
or
treacle
served
in
wooden
dishes
called
luggies
formed
of
staves
hooped
together
like
miniature
tubs
about
four
or
five
inches
in
diameter
one
of
the
staves
the
lug
or
ear
a
few
inches
longer
than
the
others
served
as
a
handle
while
the
number
of
luggies
ranged
in
a
row
on
a
dresser
indicated
the
size
of
the
family
we
never
dreamed
of
anything
to
come
after
the
porridge
or
of
asking
for
more
our
portions
were
consumed
in
about
a
couple
of
minutes
then
off
to
school
at
noon
we
came
racing
home
ravenously
hungry
the
midday
meal
called
dinner
was
usually
vegetable
broth
a
small
piece
of
boiled
mutton
and
scone
none
of
us
liked
the
barley
scone
bread
therefore
we
got
all
we
wanted
of
it
and
in
desperation
had
to
eat
it
for
we
were
always
hungry
about
as
hungry
after
as
before
meals
the
evening
meal
was
called
tea
and
was
served
on
our
return
from
school
it
consisted
as
far
as
we
children
were
concerned
of
half
a
slice
of
white
bread
without
butter
barley
scone
and
warm
water
with
a
little
milk
and
sugar
in
it
a
beverage
called
content
which
warmed
but
neither
cheered
nor
inebriated
immediately
after
tea
we
ran
across
the
street
with
our
books
to
grandfather
gilrye
who
took
pleasure
in
seeing
us
and
hearing
us
recite
our
next
day
lessons
then
back
home
to
supper
usually
a
boiled
potato
and
piece
of
barley
scone
then
family
worship
and
to
bed
our
amusements
on
saturday
afternoons
and
vacations
depended
mostly
on
getting
away
from
home
into
the
country
especially
in
the
spring
when
the
birds
were
calling
loudest
father
sternly
forbade
david
and
me
from
playing
truant
in
the
fields
with
plundering
wanderers
like
ourselves
fearing
we
might
go
on
from
bad
to
worse
get
hurt
in
climbing
over
walls
caught
by
gamekeepers
or
lost
by
falling
over
a
cliff
into
the
sea
play
as
much
as
you
like
in
the
back
yard
and
garden
he
said
and
mind
what
you
get
when
you
forget
and
disobey
thus
he
warned
us
with
an
awfully
stern
countenance
looking
very
while
naturally
his
heart
was
far
from
hard
though
he
devoutly
believed
in
eternal
punishment
for
bad
boys
both
here
and
hereafter
nevertheless
like
devout
martyrs
of
wildness
we
stole
away
to
the
seashore
or
the
green
sunny
fields
with
almost
religious
regularity
taking
advantage
of
opportunities
when
father
was
very
busy
to
join
our
companions
oftenest
to
hear
the
birds
sing
and
hunt
their
nests
glorying
in
the
number
we
had
discovered
and
called
our
own
a
sample
of
our
nest
chatter
was
something
like
this
willie
chisholm
would
proudly
exclaim
i
ken
know
seventeen
nests
and
you
johnnie
ken
only
fifteen
but
i
wouldna
gie
my
fifteen
for
your
seventeen
for
five
of
mine
are
larks
and
mavises
you
ken
only
three
o
the
best
singers
yes
johnnie
but
i
ken
six
goldies
and
you
ken
only
one
maist
of
yours
are
only
sparrows
and
linties
and
then
perhaps
bob
richardson
would
loudly
declare
that
he
kenned
mair
nests
than
onybody
for
he
kenned
with
about
fifty
eggs
in
them
and
mair
than
fifty
young
birds
maybe
a
hundred
some
of
them
naething
but
raw
gorblings
but
lots
of
them
as
big
as
their
mithers
and
ready
to
flee
and
aboot
fifty
craw
nests
and
three
fox
dens
oh
yes
bob
but
that
no
fair
for
naebody
counts
craw
nests
and
fox
holes
and
then
you
live
in
the
country
at
where
ye
have
the
best
chance
yes
but
i
ken
a
lot
of
bumbee
nests
baith
the
and
the
kind
oh
wha
cares
for
bumbee
nests
weel
but
here
something
ma
father
let
me
gang
to
a
fox
hunt
and
man
it
was
grand
to
see
the
hounds
and
the
horses
lowpin
the
dykes
and
burns
and
hedges
the
nests
i
fear
with
the
beautiful
eggs
and
young
birds
were
prized
quite
as
highly
as
the
songs
of
the
glad
parents
but
no
scotch
boy
that
i
know
of
ever
failed
to
listen
with
enthusiasm
to
the
songs
of
the
skylarks
oftentimes
on
a
broad
meadow
near
dunbar
we
stood
for
hours
enjoying
their
marvelous
singing
and
soaring
from
the
grass
where
the
nest
was
hidden
the
male
would
suddenly
rise
as
straight
as
if
shot
up
to
a
height
of
perhaps
thirty
or
forty
feet
and
sustaining
himself
with
rapid
pour
down
the
most
delicious
melody
sweet
and
clear
and
strong
overflowing
all
bounds
then
suddenly
he
would
soar
higher
again
and
again
ever
higher
and
higher
soaring
and
singing
until
lost
to
sight
even
on
perfectly
clear
days
and
oftentimes
in
cloudy
weather
far
in
the
downy
cloud
as
the
poet
says
to
test
our
eyes
we
often
watched
a
lark
until
he
seemed
a
faint
speck
in
the
sky
and
finally
passed
beyond
the
of
us
all
i
see
him
yet
we
would
cry
i
see
him
yet
i
see
him
yet
i
see
him
yet
as
he
soared
and
finally
only
one
of
us
would
be
left
to
claim
that
he
still
saw
him
at
last
he
too
would
have
to
admit
that
the
singer
had
soared
beyond
his
sight
and
still
the
music
came
pouring
down
to
us
in
glorious
profusion
from
a
height
far
above
our
vision
requiring
marvelous
power
of
wing
and
marvelous
power
of
voice
for
that
rich
delicious
soft
and
yet
clear
music
was
distinctly
heard
long
after
the
bird
was
out
of
sight
then
suddenly
ceasing
the
glorious
singer
would
appear
falling
like
a
bolt
straight
down
to
his
nest
where
his
mate
was
sitting
on
the
eggs
it
was
far
too
common
a
practice
among
us
to
carry
off
a
young
lark
just
before
it
could
fly
place
it
in
a
cage
and
fondly
laboriously
feed
it
sometimes
we
succeeded
in
keeping
one
alive
for
a
year
or
two
and
when
awakened
by
the
spring
weather
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
quivering
imprisoned
soarer
of
the
heavens
rapidly
beating
its
wings
and
singing
as
though
it
were
flying
and
hovering
in
the
air
like
its
parents
to
keep
it
in
health
we
were
taught
that
we
must
supply
it
with
a
sod
of
grass
the
size
of
the
bottom
of
the
cage
to
make
the
poor
bird
feel
as
though
it
were
at
home
on
its
native
meadow
a
meadow
perhaps
a
foot
or
at
most
two
feet
square
again
and
again
it
would
try
to
hover
over
that
miniature
meadow
from
its
miniature
sky
just
underneath
the
top
of
the
cage
at
last
we
carried
the
beloved
prisoner
to
the
meadow
west
of
dunbar
where
it
was
born
and
blessing
its
sweet
heart
bravely
set
it
free
and
our
exceeding
great
reward
was
to
see
it
fly
and
sing
in
the
sky
in
the
winter
when
there
was
but
little
doing
in
the
fields
we
organized
a
dozen
or
so
of
us
would
start
out
on
races
that
were
simply
tests
of
endurance
running
on
and
on
along
a
public
road
over
the
breezy
hills
like
hounds
without
stopping
or
getting
tired
the
only
serious
trouble
we
ever
felt
in
these
long
races
was
an
occasional
stitch
in
our
sides
one
of
the
boys
started
the
story
that
sucking
raw
eggs
was
a
sure
cure
for
the
stitches
we
had
hens
in
our
back
yard
and
on
the
next
saturday
we
managed
to
swallow
a
couple
of
eggs
apiece
a
disgusting
job
but
we
would
do
almost
anything
to
mend
our
speed
and
as
soon
as
we
could
get
away
after
taking
the
cure
we
set
out
on
a
ten
or
twenty
mile
run
to
prove
its
worth
we
thought
nothing
of
running
right
ahead
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
before
turning
back
for
we
knew
nothing
about
taking
time
by
the
sun
and
none
of
us
had
a
watch
in
those
days
indeed
we
never
cared
about
time
until
it
began
to
get
dark
then
we
thought
of
home
and
the
thrashing
that
awaited
us
late
or
early
the
thrashing
was
sure
unless
father
happened
to
be
away
if
he
was
expected
to
return
soon
mother
made
haste
to
get
us
to
bed
before
his
arrival
we
escaped
the
thrashing
next
morning
for
father
never
felt
like
thrashing
us
in
cold
blood
on
the
calm
holy
sabbath
but
no
punishment
however
sure
and
severe
was
of
any
avail
against
the
attraction
of
the
fields
and
woods
it
had
other
uses
developing
memory
but
in
keeping
us
at
home
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
wildness
was
ever
sounding
in
our
ears
and
nature
saw
to
it
that
besides
school
lessons
and
church
lessons
some
of
her
own
lessons
should
be
learned
perhaps
with
a
view
to
the
time
when
we
should
be
called
to
wander
in
wildness
to
our
heart
content
oh
the
blessed
enchantment
of
those
saturday
runaways
in
the
prime
of
the
spring
how
our
young
wondering
eyes
reveled
in
the
sunny
breezy
glory
of
the
hills
and
the
sky
every
particle
of
us
thrilling
and
tingling
with
the
bees
and
glad
birds
and
glad
streams
kings
may
be
blessed
we
were
glorious
we
were
free
school
cares
and
scoldings
heart
thrashings
and
flesh
thrashings
alike
were
forgotten
in
the
fullness
of
nature
glad
wildness
these
were
my
first
excursions
the
beginnings
of
lifelong
wanderings
ii
a
new
world
stories
of
america
glorious
news
crossing
the
atlantic
the
new
home
a
baptism
in
nature
new
birds
the
adventures
of
watch
scotch
correction
marauding
indians
our
reader
called
i
think
maccoulough
course
of
reading
contained
a
few
sketches
that
excited
me
very
much
and
left
a
deep
impression
especially
a
fine
description
of
the
fish
hawk
and
the
bald
eagle
by
the
scotch
ornithologist
wilson
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
wander
for
years
in
the
american
woods
while
the
country
was
yet
mostly
wild
i
read
his
description
over
and
over
again
till
i
got
the
vivid
picture
he
drew
by
heart
the
hawk
circling
over
the
heaving
waves
every
motion
watched
by
the
eagle
perched
on
the
top
of
a
crag
or
dead
tree
the
fish
hawk
poising
for
a
moment
to
take
aim
at
a
fish
and
plunging
under
the
water
the
eagle
with
kindling
eye
spreading
his
wings
ready
for
instant
flight
in
case
the
attack
should
prove
successful
the
hawk
emerging
with
a
struggling
fish
in
his
talons
and
proud
flight
the
eagle
launching
himself
in
pursuit
the
wonderful
in
the
sky
the
fish
hawk
though
encumbered
with
his
prey
circling
higher
higher
striving
hard
to
keep
above
the
robber
eagle
the
eagle
at
length
soaring
above
him
compelling
him
with
a
cry
of
despair
to
drop
his
prey
then
the
eagle
steadying
himself
for
a
moment
to
take
aim
descending
swift
as
a
and
seizing
the
falling
fish
before
it
reached
the
sea
not
less
exciting
and
memorable
was
audubon
wonderful
story
of
the
passenger
pigeon
a
beautiful
bird
flying
in
vast
flocks
that
darkened
the
sky
like
clouds
countless
millions
assembling
to
rest
and
sleep
and
rear
their
young
in
certain
forests
miles
in
length
and
breadth
fifty
or
a
hundred
nests
on
a
single
tree
the
overloaded
branches
bending
low
and
often
breaking
the
farmers
gathering
from
far
and
near
beating
down
countless
thousands
of
the
young
and
old
birds
from
their
nests
and
roosts
with
long
poles
at
night
and
in
the
morning
driving
their
bands
of
hogs
some
of
them
brought
from
farms
a
hundred
miles
distant
to
fatten
on
the
dead
and
wounded
covering
the
ground
in
another
of
our
some
of
the
american
forests
were
described
the
most
interesting
of
the
trees
to
us
boys
was
the
sugar
maple
and
soon
after
we
had
learned
this
sweet
story
we
heard
everybody
talking
about
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
same
country
one
night
when
david
and
i
were
at
grandfather
fireside
solemnly
learning
our
lessons
as
usual
my
father
came
in
with
news
the
most
wonderful
most
glorious
that
wild
boys
ever
heard
bairns
he
said
you
needna
learn
your
lessons
the
nicht
for
we
gan
to
america
the
morn
no
more
grammar
but
boundless
woods
full
of
mysterious
good
things
trees
full
of
sugar
growing
in
ground
full
of
gold
hawks
eagles
pigeons
filling
the
sky
millions
of
nests
and
no
gamekeepers
to
stop
us
in
all
the
wild
happy
land
we
were
utterly
blindly
glorious
after
father
left
the
room
grandfather
gave
david
and
me
a
gold
coin
apiece
for
a
keepsake
and
looked
very
serious
for
he
was
about
to
be
deserted
in
his
lonely
old
age
and
when
we
in
fullness
of
young
joy
spoke
of
what
we
were
going
to
do
of
the
wonderful
birds
and
their
nests
that
we
should
find
the
sugar
and
gold
and
promised
to
send
him
a
big
box
full
of
that
tree
sugar
packed
in
gold
from
the
glorious
paradise
over
the
sea
poor
lonely
grandfather
about
to
be
forsaken
looked
with
downcast
eyes
on
the
floor
and
said
in
a
low
trembling
troubled
voice
ah
poor
laddies
poor
laddies
you
find
something
else
ower
the
sea
forbye
gold
and
sugar
birds
nests
and
freedom
fra
lessons
and
schools
you
find
plenty
hard
hard
work
and
so
we
did
but
nothing
he
could
say
could
cloud
our
joy
or
abate
the
fire
of
youthful
hopeful
fearless
adventure
nor
could
we
in
the
midst
of
such
measureless
excitement
see
or
feel
the
shadows
and
sorrows
of
his
darkening
old
age
to
my
schoolmates
met
that
night
on
the
street
i
shouted
the
glorious
news
i
gan
to
amaraka
the
morn
none
could
believe
it
i
said
weel
just
you
see
if
i
am
at
the
skule
the
morn
next
morning
we
went
by
rail
to
glasgow
and
thence
joyfully
sailed
away
from
beloved
scotland
flying
to
our
fortunes
on
the
wings
of
the
winds
as
thistle
seeds
we
could
not
then
know
what
we
were
leaving
what
we
were
to
encounter
in
the
new
world
nor
what
our
gains
were
likely
to
be
we
were
too
young
and
full
of
hope
for
fear
or
regret
but
not
too
young
to
look
forward
with
eager
enthusiasm
to
the
wonderful
schoolless
bookless
american
wilderness
even
the
natural
of
parting
from
grandfather
and
grandmother
gilrye
who
loved
us
so
well
and
from
mother
and
sisters
and
brother
was
quickly
quenched
in
young
joy
father
took
with
him
only
my
sister
sarah
thirteen
years
of
age
myself
eleven
and
brother
david
nine
leaving
my
eldest
sister
margaret
and
the
three
youngest
of
the
family
daniel
mary
and
anna
with
mother
to
join
us
after
a
farm
had
been
found
in
the
wilderness
and
a
comfortable
house
made
to
receive
them
in
crossing
the
atlantic
before
the
days
of
steamships
or
even
the
american
clippers
the
voyages
made
in
were
very
long
ours
was
six
weeks
and
three
days
but
because
we
had
no
lessons
to
get
that
long
voyage
had
not
a
dull
moment
for
us
boys
father
and
sister
sarah
with
most
of
the
old
folk
stayed
below
in
rough
weather
groaning
in
the
miseries
of
seasickness
many
of
the
passengers
wishing
they
had
never
ventured
in
the
auld
creel
as
they
called
our
ship
and
when
the
weather
was
moderately
calm
singing
songs
in
the
evenings
the
youthful
sailor
frank
and
bold
oh
why
left
i
my
hame
why
did
i
cross
the
deep
etc
but
no
matter
how
much
the
old
tub
tossed
about
and
battered
the
waves
we
were
on
deck
every
day
not
in
the
least
seasick
watching
the
sailors
at
their
and
climbing
work
joining
in
their
songs
learning
the
names
of
the
ropes
and
sails
and
helping
them
as
far
as
they
would
let
us
playing
games
with
other
boys
in
calm
weather
when
the
deck
was
dry
and
in
stormy
weather
rejoicing
in
sympathy
with
the
big
waves
the
captain
occasionally
called
david
and
me
into
his
cabin
and
asked
us
about
our
schools
handed
us
books
to
read
and
seemed
surprised
to
find
that
scotch
boys
could
read
and
pronounce
english
with
perfect
accent
and
knew
so
much
latin
and
french
in
scotch
schools
only
pure
english
was
taught
although
not
a
word
of
english
was
spoken
out
of
school
all
through
life
however
well
educated
the
scotch
spoke
scotch
among
their
own
folk
except
at
times
when
unduly
excited
on
the
only
two
subjects
on
which
scotchmen
get
much
excited
namely
religion
and
politics
so
long
as
the
controversy
went
on
with
fairly
level
temper
only
gude
braid
scots
was
used
but
if
one
became
angry
as
was
likely
to
happen
then
he
immediately
began
speaking
severely
correct
english
while
his
antagonist
drawing
himself
up
would
say
weel
there
na
use
pursuing
this
subject
ony
further
for
i
see
ye
hae
gotten
to
your
english
as
we
neared
the
shore
of
the
great
new
land
with
what
eager
wonder
we
watched
the
whales
and
dolphins
and
porpoises
and
seabirds
and
made
the
sailors
teach
us
their
names
and
tell
us
stories
about
them
there
were
quite
a
large
number
of
emigrants
aboard
many
of
them
newly
married
couples
and
the
advantages
of
the
different
parts
of
the
new
world
they
expected
to
settle
in
were
often
discussed
my
father
started
with
the
intention
of
going
to
the
backwoods
of
upper
canada
before
the
end
of
the
voyage
however
he
was
persuaded
that
the
states
offered
superior
advantages
especially
wisconsin
and
michigan
where
the
land
was
said
to
be
as
good
as
in
canada
and
far
more
easily
brought
under
cultivation
for
in
canada
the
woods
were
so
close
and
heavy
that
a
man
might
wear
out
his
life
in
getting
a
few
acres
cleared
of
trees
and
stumps
so
he
changed
his
mind
and
concluded
to
go
to
one
of
the
western
states
on
our
wavering
westward
way
a
in
buffalo
told
father
that
most
of
the
wheat
he
handled
came
from
wisconsin
and
this
influential
information
finally
determined
my
father
choice
at
milwaukee
a
farmer
who
had
come
in
from
the
country
near
fort
winnebago
with
a
load
of
wheat
agreed
to
haul
us
and
our
formidable
load
of
stuff
to
a
little
town
called
kingston
for
thirty
dollars
on
that
journey
just
after
the
spring
thaw
the
roads
over
the
prairies
were
heavy
and
miry
causing
no
end
of
lamentation
for
we
often
got
stuck
in
the
mud
and
the
poor
farmer
sadly
declared
that
never
never
again
would
he
be
tempted
to
try
to
haul
such
a
cruel
load
no
not
for
a
hundred
dollars
in
leaving
scotland
father
like
many
other
homeseekers
burdened
himself
with
far
too
much
luggage
as
if
all
america
were
still
a
wilderness
in
which
little
or
nothing
could
be
bought
one
of
his
big
boxes
must
have
weighed
about
four
hundred
pounds
for
it
contained
an
with
a
complete
set
of
counterweights
two
of
them
pounds
each
a
and
so
on
down
to
a
single
pound
also
a
lot
of
iron
wedges
carpenter
tools
and
so
forth
and
at
buffalo
as
if
on
the
very
edge
of
the
wilderness
he
gladly
added
to
his
burden
a
big
stove
with
pots
and
pans
provisions
enough
for
a
long
siege
and
a
scythe
and
cumbersome
cradle
for
cutting
wheat
all
of
which
he
succeeded
in
landing
in
the
primeval
wisconsin
woods
a
at
kingston
gave
father
a
note
to
a
farmer
by
the
name
of
alexander
gray
who
lived
on
the
border
of
the
settled
part
of
the
country
knew
the
and
would
probably
help
him
to
find
a
good
place
for
a
farm
so
father
went
away
to
spy
out
the
land
and
in
the
mean
time
left
us
children
in
kingston
in
a
rented
room
it
took
us
less
than
an
hour
to
get
acquainted
with
some
of
the
boys
in
the
village
we
challenged
them
to
wrestle
run
races
climb
trees
and
in
a
day
or
two
we
felt
at
home
carefree
and
happy
notwithstanding
our
family
was
so
widely
divided
when
father
returned
he
told
us
that
he
had
found
fine
land
for
a
farm
in
sunny
open
woods
on
the
side
of
a
lake
and
that
a
team
of
three
yoke
of
oxen
with
a
big
wagon
was
coming
to
haul
us
to
gray
place
we
enjoyed
the
strange
ride
through
the
woods
very
much
wondering
how
the
great
oxen
could
be
so
strong
and
wise
and
tame
as
to
pull
so
heavy
a
load
with
no
other
harness
than
a
chain
and
a
crooked
piece
of
wood
on
their
necks
and
how
they
could
sway
so
obediently
to
right
and
left
past
roadside
trees
and
stumps
when
the
driver
said
and
at
gray
house
father
again
left
us
for
a
few
days
to
build
a
shanty
on
the
he
had
selected
four
or
five
miles
to
the
westward
in
the
mean
while
we
enjoyed
our
freedom
as
usual
wandering
in
the
fields
and
meadows
looking
at
the
trees
and
flowers
snakes
and
birds
and
squirrels
with
the
help
of
the
nearest
neighbors
the
little
shanty
was
built
in
less
than
a
day
after
the
rough
logs
for
the
walls
and
the
boards
for
the
floor
and
roof
were
got
together
to
this
charming
hut
in
the
sunny
woods
overlooking
a
flowery
glacier
meadow
and
a
lake
rimmed
with
white
we
were
hauled
by
an
across
trackless
carex
swamps
and
low
rolling
hills
sparsely
dotted
with
oaks
just
as
we
arrived
at
the
shanty
before
we
had
time
to
look
at
it
or
the
scenery
about
it
david
and
i
jumped
down
in
a
hurry
off
the
load
of
household
goods
for
we
had
discovered
a
blue
jay
nest
and
in
a
minute
or
so
we
were
up
the
tree
beside
it
feasting
our
eyes
on
the
beautiful
green
eggs
and
beautiful
birds
our
first
memorable
discovery
the
handsome
birds
had
not
seen
scotch
boys
before
and
made
a
desperate
screaming
as
if
we
were
robbers
like
themselves
though
we
left
the
eggs
untouched
feeling
that
we
were
already
beginning
to
get
rich
and
wondering
how
many
more
nests
we
should
find
in
the
grand
sunny
woods
then
we
ran
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
that
the
shanty
stood
on
and
down
to
the
meadow
searching
the
trees
and
grass
tufts
and
bushes
and
soon
discovered
a
bluebird
and
a
woodpecker
nest
and
began
an
acquaintance
with
the
frogs
and
snakes
and
turtles
in
the
creeks
and
springs
illustration
muir
lake
fountain
lake
and
the
garden
meadow
sketched
from
the
roof
of
the
shanty
this
sudden
plash
into
pure
wildness
baptism
in
nature
warm
heart
how
utterly
happy
it
made
us
nature
streaming
into
us
wooingly
teaching
her
wonderful
glowing
lessons
so
unlike
the
dismal
grammar
ashes
and
cinders
so
long
thrashed
into
us
here
without
knowing
it
we
still
were
at
school
every
wild
lesson
a
love
lesson
not
whipped
but
charmed
into
us
oh
that
glorious
wisconsin
wilderness
everything
new
and
pure
in
the
very
prime
of
the
spring
when
nature
pulses
were
beating
highest
and
mysteriously
keeping
time
with
our
own
young
hearts
young
leaves
flowers
animals
the
winds
and
the
streams
and
the
sparkling
lake
all
wildly
gladly
rejoicing
together
next
morning
when
we
climbed
to
the
precious
jay
nest
to
take
another
admiring
look
at
the
eggs
we
found
it
empty
not
a
was
left
and
we
wondered
how
in
the
world
the
birds
were
able
to
carry
off
their
eggs
either
in
their
bills
or
in
their
feet
without
breaking
them
and
how
they
could
be
kept
warm
while
a
new
nest
was
being
built
well
i
am
still
asking
these
questions
when
i
was
on
the
harriman
expedition
i
asked
robert
ridgway
the
eminent
ornithologist
how
these
sudden
flittings
were
accomplished
and
he
frankly
confessed
that
he
did
know
but
guessed
that
jays
and
many
other
birds
carried
their
eggs
in
their
mouths
and
when
i
objected
that
a
jay
mouth
seemed
too
small
to
hold
its
eggs
he
replied
that
birds
mouths
were
larger
than
the
narrowness
of
their
bills
indicated
then
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
they
did
with
the
eggs
while
a
new
nest
was
being
prepared
he
did
know
neither
do
i
to
this
day
a
specimen
of
the
many
puzzling
problems
presented
to
the
naturalist
we
soon
found
many
more
nests
belonging
to
birds
that
were
not
half
so
suspicious
the
handsome
and
notorious
blue
jay
plunders
the
nests
of
other
birds
and
of
course
he
could
not
trust
us
almost
all
the
others
brown
thrushes
bluebirds
song
sparrows
kingbirds
nighthawks
woodpeckers
simply
tried
to
avoid
being
seen
to
draw
or
drive
us
away
or
paid
no
attention
to
us
we
used
to
wonder
how
the
woodpeckers
could
bore
holes
so
perfectly
round
true
mathematical
circles
we
ourselves
could
not
have
done
it
even
with
gouges
and
chisels
we
loved
to
watch
them
feeding
their
young
and
wondered
how
they
could
glean
food
enough
for
so
many
clamorous
hungry
unsatisfiable
babies
and
how
they
managed
to
give
each
one
its
share
for
after
the
young
grew
strong
one
would
get
his
head
out
of
the
and
try
to
hold
possession
of
it
to
meet
the
parents
how
hard
they
worked
to
support
their
families
especially
the
and
speckledy
woodpeckers
and
flickers
digging
hammering
on
scaly
bark
and
decaying
trunks
and
branches
from
dawn
to
dark
coming
and
going
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
all
the
livelong
day
we
discovered
a
nest
on
the
top
of
a
tall
oak
thirty
or
forty
rods
from
the
shanty
and
approached
it
cautiously
one
of
the
pair
always
kept
watch
soaring
in
wide
circles
high
above
the
tree
and
when
we
attempted
to
climb
it
the
big
bird
came
swooping
down
at
us
and
drove
us
away
we
greatly
admired
the
plucky
kingbird
in
scotland
our
great
ambition
was
to
be
good
fighters
and
we
admired
this
quality
in
the
handsome
little
chattering
flycatcher
that
whips
all
the
other
birds
he
was
particularly
angry
when
plundering
jays
and
hawks
came
near
his
home
and
took
pains
to
thrash
them
not
only
away
from
the
but
out
of
the
neighborhood
the
nest
was
usually
built
on
a
bur
oak
near
a
meadow
where
insects
were
abundant
and
where
no
undesirable
visitor
could
approach
without
being
discovered
when
a
hove
in
sight
the
male
immediately
set
off
after
him
and
it
was
ridiculous
to
see
that
great
strong
bird
hurrying
away
as
fast
as
his
clumsy
wings
would
carry
him
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
little
waspish
kingbird
coming
but
the
kingbird
easily
overtook
him
flew
just
a
few
feet
above
him
and
with
a
lot
of
chattering
scolding
notes
kept
diving
and
striking
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
until
tired
then
he
alighted
to
rest
on
the
hawk
broad
shoulders
still
scolding
and
chattering
as
he
rode
along
like
an
angry
boy
pouring
out
vials
of
wrath
then
up
and
at
him
again
with
his
sharp
bill
and
after
he
had
thus
driven
and
ridden
his
big
enemy
a
mile
or
so
from
the
nest
he
went
home
to
his
mate
chuckling
and
bragging
as
if
trying
to
tell
her
what
a
wonderful
fellow
he
was
this
first
spring
while
some
of
the
birds
were
still
building
their
nests
and
very
few
young
ones
had
yet
tried
to
fly
father
hired
a
yankee
to
assist
in
clearing
eight
or
ten
acres
of
the
best
ground
for
a
field
we
found
new
wonders
every
day
and
often
had
to
call
on
this
yankee
to
solve
puzzling
questions
we
asked
him
one
day
if
there
was
any
bird
in
america
that
the
kingbird
could
whip
what
about
the
sandhill
crane
could
he
whip
that
fellow
a
crane
never
goes
near
kingbirds
nests
or
notices
so
small
a
bird
he
said
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
fighting
between
them
so
we
hastily
concluded
that
our
hero
could
whip
every
bird
in
the
country
except
perhaps
the
sandhill
crane
we
never
tired
listening
to
the
wonderful
one
came
every
night
about
dusk
and
sat
on
a
log
about
twenty
or
thirty
feet
from
our
cabin
door
and
began
shouting
whip
poor
will
whip
poor
will
with
loud
emphatic
earnestness
what
that
what
that
we
cried
when
this
startling
visitor
first
announced
himself
what
do
you
call
it
why
it
telling
you
its
name
said
the
yankee
do
you
hear
it
and
what
he
wants
you
to
do
he
says
his
name
is
will
and
he
wants
you
to
whip
him
and
you
may
if
you
are
able
to
catch
him
poor
will
seemed
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
strange
creatures
we
had
seen
what
a
wild
strong
bold
voice
he
had
unlike
any
other
we
had
ever
heard
on
sea
or
land
a
near
relative
the
or
nighthawk
seemed
hardly
less
wonderful
towards
evening
scattered
flocks
kept
the
sky
lively
as
they
circled
around
on
their
long
wings
a
hundred
feet
or
more
above
the
ground
hunting
moths
and
beetles
interrupting
their
rather
slow
but
strong
regular
at
short
intervals
with
quick
quivering
strokes
while
uttering
keen
squeaky
cries
something
like
and
every
now
and
then
diving
nearly
to
the
ground
with
a
loud
ripping
bellowing
sound
like
suggesting
its
name
then
turning
and
gliding
swiftly
up
again
these
fine
wild
gray
birds
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
lay
their
two
eggs
on
bare
ground
without
anything
like
a
nest
or
even
a
concealing
bush
or
nevertheless
they
are
not
easily
seen
for
they
are
colored
like
the
ground
while
sitting
on
their
eggs
they
depend
so
much
upon
not
being
noticed
that
if
you
are
walking
rapidly
ahead
they
allow
you
to
step
within
an
inch
or
two
of
them
without
flinching
but
if
they
see
by
your
looks
that
you
have
discovered
them
they
leave
their
eggs
or
young
and
like
a
good
many
other
birds
pretend
that
they
are
sorely
wounded
fluttering
and
rolling
over
on
the
ground
and
gasping
as
if
dying
to
draw
you
away
when
pursued
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
just
when
we
were
on
the
point
of
overtaking
them
they
were
always
able
to
flutter
a
few
yards
farther
until
they
had
led
us
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
nest
then
suddenly
getting
well
they
quietly
flew
home
by
a
roundabout
way
to
their
precious
babies
or
eggs
a
the
ills
of
life
victorious
bad
boys
among
the
worst
the
yankee
took
particular
pleasure
in
encouraging
us
to
pursue
them
everything
about
us
was
so
novel
and
wonderful
that
we
could
hardly
believe
our
senses
except
when
hungry
or
while
father
was
thrashing
us
when
we
first
saw
fountain
lake
meadow
on
a
sultry
evening
sprinkled
with
millions
of
throbbing
with
light
the
effect
was
so
strange
and
beautiful
that
it
seemed
far
too
marvelous
to
be
real
looking
from
our
shanty
on
the
hill
i
thought
that
the
whole
wonderful
fairy
show
must
be
in
my
eyes
for
only
in
fighting
when
my
eyes
were
struck
had
i
ever
seen
anything
in
the
least
like
it
but
when
i
asked
my
brother
if
he
saw
anything
strange
in
the
meadow
he
said
yes
it
all
covered
with
shaky
then
i
guessed
that
it
might
be
something
outside
of
us
and
applied
to
our
yankee
to
explain
it
oh
it
nothing
but
he
said
and
kindly
led
us
down
the
hill
to
the
edge
of
the
fiery
meadow
caught
a
few
of
the
wonderful
bugs
dropped
them
into
a
cup
and
carried
them
to
the
shanty
where
we
watched
them
throbbing
and
flashing
out
their
mysterious
light
at
regular
intervals
as
if
each
little
passionate
glow
were
caused
by
the
beating
of
a
heart
once
i
saw
a
splendid
display
of
light
in
the
foothills
of
the
himalayas
north
of
calcutta
but
glorious
as
it
appeared
in
pure
starry
radiance
it
was
far
less
impressive
than
the
extravagant
abounding
quivering
dancing
fire
on
our
wisconsin
meadow
partridge
drumming
was
another
great
marvel
when
i
first
heard
the
low
soft
solemn
sound
i
thought
it
must
be
made
by
some
strange
disturbance
in
my
head
or
stomach
but
as
all
seemed
serene
within
i
asked
david
whether
he
heard
anything
queer
yes
he
said
i
hear
something
saying
and
i
wondering
at
it
then
i
was
half
satisfied
that
the
source
of
the
mysterious
sound
must
be
in
something
outside
of
us
coming
perhaps
from
the
ground
or
from
some
ghost
or
bogie
or
woodland
fairy
only
after
long
watching
and
listening
did
we
at
last
discover
it
in
the
wings
of
the
plump
brown
bird
the
of
the
common
jack
snipe
seemed
not
a
whit
less
mysterious
than
partridge
drumming
it
was
usually
heard
on
cloudy
evenings
a
strange
unearthly
winnowing
spiritlike
sound
yet
easily
heard
at
a
distance
of
a
third
of
a
mile
our
sharp
eyes
soon
detected
the
bird
while
making
it
as
it
circled
high
in
the
air
over
the
meadow
with
wonderfully
strong
and
rapid
suddenly
descending
and
rising
again
and
again
in
deep
wide
loops
the
tones
being
very
low
and
smooth
at
the
beginning
of
the
descent
rapidly
increasing
to
a
curious
little
whirling
at
the
bottom
and
gradually
fading
lower
and
lower
until
the
top
was
reached
it
was
long
however
before
we
identified
this
mysterious
as
the
little
brown
jack
snipe
that
we
knew
so
well
and
had
so
often
watched
as
he
silently
probed
the
mud
around
the
edges
of
our
meadow
stream
and
and
made
short
zigzag
flights
over
the
grass
uttering
only
little
short
crisp
quacks
and
chucks
the
of
the
frogs
seemed
hardly
less
wonderful
than
those
of
the
birds
their
musical
notes
varying
from
the
sweet
tranquil
soothing
peeping
and
purring
of
the
hylas
to
the
awfully
deep
blunt
bellowing
of
the
bullfrogs
some
of
the
smaller
species
have
wonderfully
clear
sharp
voices
and
told
us
their
good
bible
names
in
musical
tones
about
as
plainly
as
the
isaac
yacob
yacob
israel
shouted
in
sharp
ringing
tones
as
if
they
had
all
been
to
school
and
severely
drilled
in
elocution
in
the
still
warm
evenings
big
bunchy
bullfrogs
bellowed
drunk
drunk
jug
o
rum
jug
o
and
early
in
the
spring
countless
thousands
of
the
commonest
species
up
to
the
throat
in
cold
water
sang
in
concert
making
a
mass
of
music
such
as
it
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
a
distance
of
more
than
half
a
mile
far
far
apart
from
this
loud
marsh
music
is
that
of
the
many
species
of
hyla
a
sort
of
soothing
immortal
melody
filling
the
air
like
light
we
reveled
in
the
glory
of
the
sky
scenery
as
well
as
that
of
the
woods
and
meadows
and
rushy
lakes
the
great
thunderstorms
in
particular
interested
us
so
unlike
any
seen
in
scotland
exciting
awful
wondering
admiration
gazing
we
watched
the
upbuilding
of
the
sublime
glowing
pearl
and
alabaster
cumuli
glorious
in
beauty
and
majesty
and
looking
so
firm
and
lasting
that
birds
we
thought
might
build
their
nests
amid
their
downy
bosses
the
marching
in
awful
grandeur
across
the
landscape
trailing
broad
gray
sheets
of
hail
and
rain
like
vast
cataracts
and
ever
and
anon
flashing
down
vivid
zigzag
lightning
followed
by
terrible
crashing
thunder
we
saw
several
trees
shattered
and
one
of
them
a
punky
old
oak
was
set
on
fire
while
we
wondered
why
all
the
trees
and
everybody
and
everything
did
not
share
the
same
fate
for
oftentimes
the
whole
sky
blazed
after
sultry
storm
days
many
of
the
nights
were
darkened
by
smooth
black
apparently
structureless
which
at
short
intervals
were
illumined
with
startling
suddenness
to
a
fiery
glow
by
quick
quivering
revealing
the
landscape
in
almost
noonday
brightness
to
be
instantly
quenched
in
solid
blackness
but
those
first
days
and
weeks
of
unmixed
enjoyment
and
freedom
reveling
in
the
wonderful
wildness
about
us
were
soon
to
be
mingled
with
the
hard
work
of
making
a
farm
i
was
first
put
to
burning
brush
in
clearing
land
for
the
plough
those
magnificent
brush
fires
with
great
white
hearts
and
red
flames
the
first
big
wild
outdoor
fires
i
had
ever
seen
were
wonderful
sights
for
young
eyes
again
and
again
when
they
were
burning
fiercest
so
that
we
could
hardly
approach
near
enough
to
throw
on
another
branch
father
put
them
to
awfully
practical
use
as
warning
lessons
comparing
their
heat
with
that
of
hell
and
the
branches
with
bad
boys
now
john
he
would
say
now
john
just
think
what
an
awful
thing
it
would
be
to
be
thrown
into
that
fire
and
then
think
of
hellfire
that
is
so
many
times
hotter
into
that
fire
all
bad
boys
with
sinners
of
every
sort
who
disobey
god
will
be
cast
as
we
are
casting
branches
into
this
brush
fire
and
although
suffering
so
much
their
sufferings
will
never
never
end
because
neither
the
fire
nor
the
sinners
can
die
but
those
terrible
fire
lessons
quickly
faded
away
in
the
blithe
wilderness
air
for
no
fire
can
be
hotter
than
the
heavenly
fire
of
faith
and
hope
that
burns
in
every
healthy
boy
heart
soon
after
our
arrival
in
the
woods
some
one
added
a
cat
and
puppy
to
the
animals
father
had
bought
the
cat
soon
had
kittens
and
it
was
interesting
to
watch
her
feeding
protecting
and
training
them
after
they
were
able
to
leave
their
nest
and
play
she
went
out
hunting
and
brought
in
many
kinds
of
birds
and
squirrels
for
them
mostly
ground
squirrels
spermophiles
called
gophers
in
wisconsin
when
she
got
within
a
dozen
yards
or
so
of
the
shanty
she
announced
her
approach
by
a
peculiar
call
and
the
sleeping
kittens
immediately
bounced
up
and
ran
to
meet
her
all
racing
for
the
first
bite
of
they
knew
not
what
and
we
too
ran
to
see
what
she
brought
she
then
lay
down
a
few
minutes
to
rest
and
enjoy
the
enjoyment
of
her
feasting
family
and
again
vanished
in
the
grass
and
flowers
coming
and
going
every
or
so
sometimes
she
brought
in
birds
that
we
had
never
seen
before
and
occasionally
a
flying
squirrel
chipmunk
or
big
fox
squirrel
we
were
just
old
enough
david
and
i
to
regard
all
these
creatures
as
wonders
the
strange
inhabitants
of
our
new
world
the
pup
was
a
common
cur
though
very
uncommon
to
us
a
black
and
white
mongrel
that
we
named
watch
we
always
gave
him
a
pan
of
milk
in
the
evening
just
before
we
knelt
in
family
worship
while
daylight
still
lingered
in
the
shanty
and
instead
of
attending
to
the
prayers
i
too
often
studied
the
small
wild
creatures
playing
around
us
field
mice
scampered
about
the
cabin
as
though
it
had
been
built
for
them
alone
and
their
performances
were
very
amusing
about
dusk
on
one
of
the
calm
sultry
nights
so
grateful
to
moths
and
beetles
when
the
puppy
was
lapping
his
milk
and
we
were
on
our
knees
in
through
the
door
came
a
heavy
beetle
about
as
big
as
a
mouse
and
after
it
had
droned
and
boomed
round
the
cabin
two
or
three
times
the
pan
of
milk
showing
white
in
the
gloaming
caught
its
eyes
and
taking
good
aim
it
alighted
with
a
slanting
glinting
plash
in
the
middle
of
the
pan
like
a
duck
alighting
in
a
lake
baby
watch
having
never
before
seen
anything
like
that
beetle
started
back
gazing
in
dumb
astonishment
and
fear
at
the
black
sprawling
monster
trying
to
swim
recovering
somewhat
from
his
fright
he
began
to
bark
at
the
creature
and
ran
round
and
round
his
gurring
growling
like
an
old
dog
barking
at
a
or
a
bear
the
natural
astonishment
and
curiosity
of
that
boy
dog
getting
his
first
entomological
lesson
in
this
wonderful
world
was
so
immoderately
funny
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
from
laughing
out
loud
snapping
turtles
were
common
throughout
the
woods
and
we
were
delighted
to
find
that
they
would
snap
at
a
stick
and
hang
on
like
and
we
amused
ourselves
by
introducing
watch
to
them
enjoying
his
curious
behavior
and
theirs
in
getting
acquainted
with
each
other
one
day
we
assisted
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
turtles
to
get
a
good
grip
of
poor
watch
ear
then
away
he
rushed
holding
his
head
sidewise
yelping
and
with
the
strange
buglike
reptile
biting
hard
and
clinging
fast
a
shameful
amusement
even
for
wild
boys
as
a
playmate
watch
was
too
serious
though
he
learned
more
than
any
stranger
would
judge
him
capable
of
was
a
bold
faithful
and
in
his
prime
a
grand
fighter
able
to
whip
all
the
other
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
comparing
him
with
ourselves
we
soon
learned
that
although
he
could
not
read
books
he
could
read
faces
was
a
good
judge
of
character
always
knew
what
was
going
on
and
what
we
were
about
to
do
and
liked
to
help
us
we
could
run
nearly
as
fast
as
he
could
see
about
as
far
and
perhaps
hear
as
well
but
in
sense
of
smell
his
nose
was
incomparably
better
than
ours
one
sharp
winter
morning
when
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
i
noticed
that
when
he
was
yawning
and
stretching
himself
after
leaving
his
bed
he
suddenly
caught
the
scent
of
something
that
excited
him
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
looked
intently
to
the
westward
across
a
tongue
of
land
that
we
called
west
bank
eagerly
questioning
the
air
with
quivering
nostrils
and
bristling
up
as
though
he
felt
sure
that
there
was
something
dangerous
in
that
direction
and
had
actually
caught
sight
of
it
then
he
ran
toward
the
bank
and
i
followed
him
curious
to
see
what
his
nose
had
discovered
the
top
of
the
bank
commanded
a
view
of
the
north
end
of
our
lake
and
meadow
and
when
we
got
there
we
saw
an
indian
hunter
with
a
long
spear
going
from
one
muskrat
cabin
to
another
approaching
cautiously
careful
to
make
no
noise
and
then
suddenly
thrusting
his
spear
down
through
the
house
if
well
aimed
the
spear
went
through
the
poor
beaver
rat
as
it
lay
cuddled
up
in
the
snug
nest
it
had
made
for
itself
in
the
fall
with
so
much
care
and
when
the
hunter
felt
the
spear
quivering
he
dug
down
the
mossy
hut
with
his
tomahawk
and
secured
his
prey
the
flesh
for
food
and
the
skin
to
sell
for
a
dime
or
so
this
was
a
clear
object
lesson
on
keenness
of
scent
that
indian
was
more
than
half
a
mile
away
across
a
wooded
ridge
had
the
hunter
been
a
white
man
i
suppose
watch
would
not
have
noticed
him
when
he
was
about
six
or
seven
years
old
he
not
only
became
cross
so
that
he
would
do
only
what
he
liked
but
he
fell
on
evil
ways
and
was
accused
by
the
neighbors
who
had
settled
around
us
of
catching
and
devouring
whole
broods
of
chickens
some
of
them
only
a
day
or
two
out
of
the
shell
we
never
imagined
he
would
do
anything
so
grossly
undoglike
he
never
did
at
home
but
several
of
the
neighbors
declared
over
and
over
again
that
they
had
caught
him
in
the
act
and
insisted
that
he
must
be
shot
at
last
in
spite
of
tearful
protests
he
was
condemned
and
executed
father
examined
the
poor
fellow
stomach
in
search
of
sure
evidence
and
discovered
the
heads
of
eight
chickens
that
he
had
devoured
at
his
last
meal
so
poor
watch
was
killed
simply
because
his
taste
for
chickens
was
too
much
like
our
own
think
of
the
millions
of
squabs
that
preaching
praying
men
and
women
kill
and
eat
with
all
sorts
of
other
animals
great
and
small
young
and
old
while
eloquently
discoursing
on
the
coming
of
the
blessed
peaceful
bloodless
millennium
think
of
the
passenger
pigeons
that
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
filled
the
woods
and
sky
over
half
the
continent
now
exterminated
by
beating
down
the
young
from
the
nests
together
with
the
brooding
parents
before
they
could
try
their
wonderful
wings
by
trapping
them
in
nets
feeding
them
to
hogs
etc
none
of
our
fellow
mortals
is
safe
who
eats
what
we
eat
who
in
any
way
interferes
with
our
pleasures
or
who
may
be
used
for
work
or
food
clothing
or
ornament
or
mere
cruel
sportish
amusement
fortunately
many
are
too
small
to
be
seen
and
therefore
enjoy
life
beyond
our
reach
and
in
looking
through
god
great
stone
books
made
up
of
records
reaching
back
millions
and
millions
of
years
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
learn
that
vast
multitudes
of
creatures
great
and
small
and
infinite
in
number
lived
and
had
a
good
time
in
god
love
before
man
was
created
the
old
scotch
fashion
of
whipping
for
every
act
of
disobedience
or
of
simple
playful
forgetfulness
was
still
kept
up
in
the
wilderness
and
of
course
many
of
those
whippings
fell
upon
me
most
of
them
were
outrageously
severe
and
utterly
barren
of
fun
but
here
is
one
that
was
nearly
all
fun
father
was
busy
hauling
lumber
for
the
frame
house
that
was
to
be
got
ready
for
the
arrival
of
my
mother
sisters
and
brother
left
behind
in
scotland
one
morning
when
he
was
ready
to
start
for
another
load
his
was
not
to
be
found
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
anything
about
it
i
told
him
i
did
know
where
it
was
but
scotch
conscience
compelled
me
to
confess
that
when
i
was
playing
with
it
i
had
tied
it
to
watch
tail
and
that
he
ran
away
dragging
it
through
the
grass
and
came
back
without
it
it
must
have
slipped
off
his
tail
i
said
and
so
i
did
know
where
it
was
this
honest
straightforward
little
story
made
father
so
angry
that
he
exclaimed
with
heavy
foreboding
emphasis
the
very
deevil
in
that
boy
david
who
had
been
playing
with
me
and
was
perhaps
about
as
responsible
for
the
loss
of
the
whip
as
i
was
said
never
a
word
for
he
was
always
prudent
enough
to
hold
his
tongue
when
the
parental
weather
was
stormy
and
so
escaped
nearly
all
punishment
and
strange
to
say
this
time
i
also
escaped
all
except
a
terrible
scolding
though
the
thrashing
weather
seemed
darker
than
ever
as
if
unwilling
to
let
the
sun
see
the
shameful
job
father
took
me
into
the
cabin
where
the
storm
was
to
fall
and
sent
david
to
the
woods
for
a
switch
while
he
was
out
selecting
the
switch
father
put
in
the
spare
time
sketching
my
in
awful
colors
and
of
course
referred
again
and
again
to
the
place
prepared
for
bad
boys
in
the
midst
of
this
terrible
dreading
most
the
impending
thrashing
i
whimpered
that
i
was
only
playing
because
i
could
help
it
did
know
i
was
doing
wrong
would
do
it
again
and
so
forth
after
this
miserable
dialogue
was
about
exhausted
father
became
impatient
at
my
brother
for
taking
so
long
to
find
the
switch
and
so
was
i
for
i
wanted
to
have
the
thing
over
and
done
with
at
last
in
came
david
a
picture
of
innocence
solemnly
dragging
a
young
sapling
and
handed
the
end
of
it
to
father
saying
it
was
the
best
switch
he
could
find
it
was
an
awfully
heavy
one
about
two
and
a
half
inches
thick
at
the
butt
and
ten
feet
long
almost
big
enough
for
a
there
was
room
enough
in
the
cabin
to
swing
it
and
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
burst
out
laughing
in
the
midst
of
my
fears
but
father
failed
to
see
the
fun
and
was
very
angry
at
david
heaved
the
outside
and
passionately
demanded
his
reason
for
fetching
sic
a
muckle
rail
like
that
instead
o
a
switch
do
ye
ca
that
a
switch
i
have
a
gude
mind
to
thrash
you
insteed
o
john
david
with
demure
downcast
eyes
looked
preternaturally
righteous
but
as
usual
prudently
answered
never
a
word
it
was
a
hard
job
in
those
days
to
bring
up
scotch
boys
in
the
way
they
should
go
and
poor
overworked
father
was
determined
to
do
it
if
enough
of
the
right
kind
of
switches
could
be
found
but
this
time
as
the
sun
was
getting
high
he
hitched
up
old
tom
and
jerry
and
made
haste
to
the
kingston
leaving
me
unscathed
and
as
innocently
wicked
as
ever
for
hardly
had
father
got
fairly
out
of
sight
among
the
oaks
and
hickories
ere
all
our
troubles
and
exhortations
were
forgotten
in
the
fun
we
had
lassoing
a
stubborn
old
sow
and
laboriously
trying
to
teach
her
to
go
reasonably
steady
in
rope
harness
she
was
the
first
hog
that
father
bought
to
stock
the
farm
and
we
boys
regarded
her
as
a
very
wonderful
beast
in
a
few
weeks
she
had
a
lot
of
pigs
and
of
all
the
queer
funny
animal
children
we
had
yet
seen
none
amused
us
more
they
were
so
comic
in
size
and
shape
in
their
gait
and
gestures
their
merry
sham
fights
and
the
false
alarms
they
got
up
for
the
fun
of
scampering
back
to
their
mother
and
begging
her
in
most
persuasive
little
squeals
to
lie
down
and
give
them
a
drink
after
her
darling
babies
were
about
a
month
old
she
took
them
out
to
the
woods
and
gradually
roamed
farther
and
farther
from
the
shanty
in
search
of
acorns
and
roots
one
afternoon
we
heard
a
a
very
noticeable
thing
as
we
had
no
near
neighbors
as
yet
we
thought
it
must
have
been
fired
by
an
indian
on
the
trail
that
followed
the
right
bank
of
the
fox
river
between
portage
and
packwaukee
lake
and
passed
our
shanty
at
a
distance
of
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
just
a
few
minutes
after
that
shot
was
heard
along
came
the
poor
mother
rushing
up
to
the
shanty
for
protection
with
her
pigs
all
out
of
breath
and
one
of
them
was
missing
and
we
supposed
of
course
that
an
indian
had
shot
it
for
food
next
day
i
discovered
a
where
the
indian
trail
crossed
the
outlet
of
our
lake
one
of
father
hired
men
told
us
that
the
indians
thought
nothing
of
levying
this
sort
of
blackmail
whenever
they
were
hungry
the
solemn
awe
and
fear
in
the
eyes
of
that
old
mother
and
those
little
pigs
i
never
can
forget
it
was
as
unmistakable
and
deadly
a
fear
as
i
ever
saw
expressed
by
any
human
eye
and
corroborates
in
no
uncertain
way
the
oneness
of
all
of
us
iii
life
on
a
wisconsin
farm
humanity
in
oxen
jack
the
pony
learning
to
ride
nob
and
nell
snakes
mosquitoes
and
their
kin
fish
and
fishing
considering
the
lilies
learning
to
swim
a
narrow
escape
from
drowning
and
a
victory
accidents
to
animals
coming
direct
from
school
in
scotland
while
we
were
still
hopefully
ignorant
and
far
from
tame
notwithstanding
the
unnatural
profusion
of
teaching
and
thrashing
lavished
upon
us
getting
acquainted
with
the
animals
about
us
was
a
source
of
wonder
and
delight
at
first
my
father
like
nearly
all
the
backwoods
settlers
bought
a
yoke
of
oxen
to
do
the
farm
work
and
as
field
after
field
was
cleared
the
number
was
gradually
increased
until
we
had
five
yoke
these
wise
patient
plodding
animals
did
all
the
ploughing
logging
hauling
and
hard
work
of
every
sort
for
the
first
four
or
five
years
and
never
having
seen
oxen
before
we
looked
at
them
with
the
same
eager
freshness
of
conception
as
we
did
at
the
wild
animals
we
worked
with
them
sympathized
with
them
in
their
rest
and
toil
and
play
and
thus
learned
to
know
them
far
better
than
we
should
had
we
been
only
trained
scientific
naturalists
we
soon
learned
that
each
ox
and
cow
and
calf
had
individual
character
old
buck
one
of
the
second
yoke
of
oxen
we
owned
was
a
notably
sagacious
fellow
he
seemed
to
reason
sometimes
almost
like
ourselves
in
the
fall
we
fed
the
cattle
lots
of
pumpkins
and
had
to
split
them
open
so
that
mouthfuls
could
be
readily
broken
off
but
buck
never
waited
for
us
to
come
to
his
help
the
others
when
they
were
hungry
and
impatient
tried
to
break
through
the
hard
rind
with
their
teeth
but
seldom
with
success
if
the
pumpkin
was
full
grown
buck
never
wasted
time
in
this
mumbling
slavering
way
but
crushed
them
with
his
head
he
went
to
the
pile
picked
out
a
good
one
like
a
boy
choosing
an
orange
or
apple
rolled
it
down
on
to
the
open
ground
deliberately
kneeled
in
front
of
it
placed
his
broad
flat
brow
on
top
of
it
brought
his
weight
hard
down
and
crushed
it
then
quietly
arose
and
went
on
with
his
meal
in
comfort
some
would
call
this
instinct
as
if
blind
instinct
must
necessarily
make
an
ox
stand
on
its
head
to
break
pumpkins
when
its
teeth
got
sore
or
when
nobody
came
with
an
axe
to
split
them
another
fine
ox
showed
his
skill
when
hungry
by
opening
all
the
fences
that
stood
in
his
way
to
the
the
humanity
we
found
in
them
came
partly
through
the
expression
of
their
eyes
when
tired
their
tones
of
voice
when
hungry
and
calling
for
food
their
patient
plodding
and
pulling
in
hot
weather
their
sighing
breath
when
exhausted
and
suffering
like
ourselves
and
their
enjoyment
of
rest
with
the
same
grateful
looks
as
ours
we
recognized
their
kinship
also
by
their
yawning
like
ourselves
when
sleepy
and
evidently
enjoying
the
same
peculiar
pleasure
at
the
roots
of
their
jaws
by
the
way
they
stretched
themselves
in
the
morning
after
a
good
rest
by
learning
languages
scotch
english
irish
french
dutch
a
smattering
of
each
as
required
in
the
faithful
service
they
so
willingly
wisely
rendered
by
their
intelligent
alert
curiosity
manifested
in
listening
to
strange
sounds
their
love
of
play
the
attachments
they
made
and
their
mourning
long
continued
when
a
companion
was
killed
when
we
went
to
portage
our
nearest
town
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
farm
it
would
oftentimes
be
late
before
we
got
back
and
in
the
in
sultry
rainy
weather
the
clouds
were
full
of
sheet
lightning
which
every
minute
or
two
would
suddenly
illumine
the
landscape
revealing
all
its
features
the
hills
and
valleys
meadows
and
trees
about
as
fully
and
clearly
as
the
noonday
sunshine
then
as
suddenly
the
glorious
light
would
be
quenched
making
the
darkness
seem
denser
than
before
on
such
nights
the
cattle
had
to
find
the
way
home
without
any
help
from
us
but
they
never
got
off
the
track
for
they
followed
it
by
scent
like
dogs
once
father
returning
late
from
portage
or
kingston
compelled
tom
and
jerry
our
first
oxen
to
leave
the
dim
track
imagining
they
must
be
going
wrong
at
last
they
stopped
and
refused
to
go
farther
then
father
unhitched
them
from
the
wagon
took
hold
of
tom
tail
and
was
thus
led
straight
to
the
shanty
next
morning
he
set
out
to
seek
his
wagon
and
found
it
on
the
brow
of
a
steep
hill
above
an
impassable
swamp
we
learned
less
from
the
cows
because
we
did
not
enter
so
far
into
their
lives
working
with
them
suffering
heat
and
cold
hunger
and
thirst
and
almost
deadly
weariness
with
them
but
none
with
natural
charity
could
fail
to
sympathize
with
them
in
their
love
for
their
calves
and
to
feel
that
it
in
no
way
differed
from
the
divine
of
a
woman
in
thoughtful
care
for
they
would
brave
every
danger
giving
their
lives
for
their
offspring
nor
could
we
fail
to
sympathize
with
their
awkward
baby
calves
with
such
beautiful
wondering
eyes
looking
out
on
the
world
and
slowly
getting
acquainted
with
things
all
so
strange
to
them
and
awkwardly
learning
to
use
their
legs
and
play
and
fight
before
leaving
scotland
father
promised
us
a
pony
to
ride
when
we
got
to
america
and
we
saw
to
it
that
this
promise
was
not
forgotten
only
a
week
or
two
after
our
arrival
in
the
woods
he
bought
us
a
little
indian
pony
for
thirteen
dollars
from
a
in
kingston
who
had
obtained
him
from
a
winnebago
or
menominee
indian
in
trade
for
goods
he
was
a
stout
handsome
bay
with
long
black
mane
and
tail
and
though
he
was
only
two
years
old
the
indians
had
already
taught
him
to
carry
all
sorts
of
burdens
to
stand
without
being
tied
to
go
anywhere
over
all
sorts
of
ground
fast
or
slow
and
to
jump
and
swim
and
fear
nothing
a
truly
wonderful
creature
strangely
different
from
shy
skittish
nervous
superstitious
civilized
beasts
we
turned
him
loose
and
strange
to
say
he
never
ran
away
from
us
or
refused
to
be
caught
but
behaved
as
if
he
had
known
scotch
boys
all
his
life
probably
because
we
were
about
as
wild
as
young
indians
one
day
when
father
happened
to
have
a
little
leisure
he
said
noo
bairns
rin
doon
the
meadow
and
get
your
powny
and
learn
to
ride
him
so
we
led
him
out
to
a
smooth
place
near
an
indian
mound
back
of
the
shanty
where
father
directed
us
to
begin
i
mounted
for
the
first
memorable
lesson
crossed
the
mound
and
set
out
at
a
slow
walk
along
the
made
in
hauling
lumber
then
father
shouted
whup
him
up
john
whup
him
up
make
him
gallop
gallopin
is
easier
and
better
than
walkin
or
trottin
jack
was
willing
and
away
he
sped
at
a
good
fast
gallop
i
managed
to
keep
my
balance
fairly
well
by
holding
fast
to
the
mane
but
could
not
keep
from
bumping
up
and
down
for
i
was
plump
and
elastic
and
so
was
jack
therefore
about
half
of
the
time
i
was
in
the
air
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
of
this
curious
transportation
i
cried
whoa
jack
the
wonderful
creature
seemed
to
understand
scotch
for
he
stopped
so
suddenly
i
flew
over
his
head
but
he
stood
perfectly
still
as
if
that
flying
method
of
dismounting
were
the
regular
way
jumping
on
again
i
bumped
and
bobbed
back
along
the
grassy
flowery
track
over
the
indian
mound
cried
whoa
jack
flew
over
his
head
and
alighted
in
father
arms
as
gracefully
as
if
it
were
all
intended
for
circus
work
after
going
over
the
course
five
or
six
times
in
the
same
free
picturesque
style
i
gave
place
to
brother
david
whose
performances
were
much
like
my
own
in
a
few
weeks
however
or
a
month
we
were
taking
adventurous
rides
more
than
a
mile
long
out
to
a
big
meadow
frequented
by
sandhill
cranes
and
returning
safely
with
wonderful
stories
of
the
great
birds
we
had
seen
and
how
on
the
whole
journey
away
and
back
we
had
fallen
off
only
five
or
six
times
gradually
we
learned
to
gallop
through
the
woods
without
roads
of
any
sort
bareback
and
without
rope
or
bridle
guiding
only
by
leaning
from
side
to
side
or
by
slight
knee
pressure
in
this
free
way
we
used
to
amuse
ourselves
riding
at
full
speed
across
a
big
kettle
that
was
on
our
farm
without
holding
on
by
either
mane
or
tail
these
kettles
were
formed
by
the
melting
of
large
detached
blocks
of
ice
that
had
been
buried
in
moraine
material
thousands
of
years
ago
when
the
that
covered
all
this
region
was
receding
as
the
buried
ice
melted
of
course
the
moraine
material
above
and
about
it
fell
in
forming
hollows
while
the
grass
growing
on
their
sides
and
around
them
prevented
the
rain
and
wind
from
filling
them
up
the
one
we
performed
in
was
perhaps
seventy
or
eighty
feet
wide
and
twenty
or
thirty
feet
deep
and
without
a
saddle
or
hold
of
any
kind
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
from
slipping
over
jack
head
in
diving
into
it
or
over
his
tail
climbing
out
this
was
fine
sport
on
the
long
summer
sundays
when
we
were
able
to
steal
away
before
without
being
seen
we
got
very
warm
and
red
at
it
and
oftentimes
poor
jack
dripping
with
sweat
like
his
riders
seemed
to
have
been
boiled
in
that
kettle
in
scotland
we
had
often
been
admonished
to
be
bold
and
this
advice
we
passed
on
to
jack
who
had
already
got
many
a
wild
lesson
from
indian
boys
once
when
teaching
him
to
jump
muddy
streams
i
made
him
try
the
creek
in
our
meadow
at
a
place
where
it
is
about
twelve
feet
wide
he
jumped
bravely
enough
but
came
down
with
a
grand
splash
hardly
more
than
halfway
over
the
water
was
only
about
a
foot
in
depth
but
the
black
vegetable
mud
half
afloat
was
unfathomable
i
managed
to
wallow
ashore
but
poor
jack
sank
deeper
and
deeper
until
only
his
head
was
visible
in
the
black
abyss
and
his
indian
fortitude
was
desperately
tried
his
foundering
so
suddenly
in
the
treacherous
gulf
recalled
the
story
of
the
abbot
of
aberbrothok
bell
which
went
down
with
a
gurgling
sound
while
bubbles
rose
and
burst
around
i
had
to
go
to
father
for
help
he
tied
a
long
hemp
rope
brought
from
scotland
around
jack
neck
and
tom
and
jerry
seemed
to
have
all
they
could
do
to
pull
him
out
after
which
i
got
a
solemn
scolding
for
asking
the
puir
beast
to
jump
intil
sic
a
saft
bottomless
place
we
moved
into
our
frame
house
in
the
fall
when
mother
with
the
rest
of
the
family
arrived
from
scotland
and
when
the
winter
snow
began
to
fly
the
shanty
was
made
into
a
stable
for
jack
father
told
us
that
good
meadow
hay
was
all
he
required
but
we
fed
him
corn
lots
of
it
and
he
grew
very
frisky
and
fat
about
the
middle
of
winter
his
long
hair
was
full
of
dust
and
as
we
thought
required
washing
so
without
taking
the
frosty
weather
into
account
we
gave
him
a
thorough
soap
and
water
scouring
and
as
we
failed
to
get
him
rubbed
dry
a
row
of
icicles
formed
under
his
belly
father
happened
to
see
him
in
this
condition
and
angrily
asked
what
we
had
been
about
we
said
jack
was
dirty
and
we
had
washed
him
to
make
him
healthy
he
told
us
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
soaking
the
puir
beast
in
cauld
water
at
this
time
o
year
that
when
we
wanted
to
clean
him
we
should
have
sense
enough
to
use
the
brush
and
illustration
our
first
wisconsin
home
on
the
hill
near
the
shanty
built
in
the
summer
of
in
summer
dave
or
i
had
to
ride
after
the
cows
every
evening
about
sundown
and
jack
got
so
accustomed
to
bringing
in
the
drove
that
when
we
happened
to
be
a
few
minutes
late
he
used
to
go
off
alone
at
the
regular
time
and
bring
them
home
at
a
gallop
it
used
to
make
father
very
angry
to
see
jack
chasing
the
cows
like
a
shepherd
dog
running
from
one
to
the
other
and
giving
each
a
bite
on
the
rump
to
keep
them
on
the
run
flying
before
him
as
if
pursued
by
wolves
father
would
declare
at
times
that
the
wicked
beast
had
the
deevil
in
him
and
would
be
the
death
of
the
cattle
the
corral
and
barn
were
just
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
he
made
a
great
display
of
the
drove
on
the
home
stretch
as
they
walloped
down
that
hill
with
their
tails
on
end
one
evening
when
the
wild
west
show
was
at
its
wildest
it
made
father
so
extravagantly
mad
that
he
ordered
me
to
shoot
jack
i
went
to
the
house
and
brought
the
gun
suffering
most
horrible
mental
anguish
such
as
i
suppose
unhappy
abraham
felt
when
commanded
to
slay
isaac
jack
life
was
spared
however
though
i
ca
tell
what
finally
became
of
him
i
wish
i
could
after
father
bought
a
span
of
work
horses
he
was
sold
to
a
man
who
said
he
was
going
to
ride
him
across
the
plains
to
california
we
had
him
i
think
some
five
or
six
years
he
was
the
stoutest
gentlest
bravest
little
horse
i
ever
saw
he
never
seemed
tired
could
canter
all
day
with
a
man
about
as
heavy
as
himself
on
his
back
and
feared
nothing
once
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
of
beef
that
was
tied
on
his
back
slid
over
his
shoulders
along
his
neck
and
weighed
down
his
head
to
the
ground
fairly
anchoring
him
but
he
stood
patient
and
still
for
half
an
hour
or
so
without
making
the
slightest
struggle
to
free
himself
while
i
was
away
getting
help
to
untie
the
and
set
the
load
back
in
its
place
as
i
was
the
eldest
boy
i
had
the
care
of
our
first
span
of
work
horses
their
names
were
nob
and
nell
nob
was
very
intelligent
and
even
affectionate
and
could
learn
almost
anything
nell
was
entirely
different
balky
and
stubborn
though
we
managed
to
teach
her
a
good
many
circus
tricks
but
she
never
seemed
to
like
to
play
with
us
in
anything
like
an
affectionate
way
as
nob
did
we
turned
them
out
one
day
into
the
pasture
and
an
indian
hiding
in
the
brush
that
had
sprung
up
after
the
grass
fires
had
been
kept
out
managed
to
catch
nob
tied
a
rope
to
her
jaw
for
a
bridle
rode
her
to
green
lake
about
thirty
or
forty
miles
away
and
tried
to
sell
her
for
fifteen
dollars
all
our
hearts
were
sore
as
if
one
of
the
family
had
been
lost
we
hunted
everywhere
and
could
not
at
first
imagine
what
had
become
of
her
we
discovered
her
track
where
the
fence
was
broken
down
and
following
it
for
a
few
miles
made
sure
the
track
was
nob
and
a
neighbor
told
us
he
had
seen
an
indian
riding
fast
through
the
woods
on
a
horse
that
looked
like
nob
but
we
could
find
no
farther
trace
of
her
until
a
month
or
two
after
she
was
lost
and
we
had
given
up
hope
of
ever
seeing
her
again
then
we
learned
that
she
had
been
taken
from
an
indian
by
a
farmer
at
green
lake
because
he
saw
that
she
had
been
shod
and
had
worked
in
harness
so
when
the
indian
tried
to
sell
her
the
farmer
said
you
are
a
thief
that
is
a
white
man
horse
you
stole
her
no
said
the
indian
i
brought
her
from
prairie
du
chien
and
she
has
always
been
mine
the
man
pointing
to
her
feet
and
the
marks
of
the
harness
said
you
are
lying
i
will
take
that
horse
away
from
you
and
put
her
in
my
pasture
and
if
you
come
near
it
i
will
set
the
dogs
on
you
then
he
advertised
her
one
of
our
neighbors
happened
to
see
the
advertisement
and
brought
us
the
glad
news
and
great
was
our
rejoicing
when
father
brought
her
home
that
indian
must
have
treated
her
with
terrible
cruelty
for
when
i
was
riding
her
through
the
pasture
several
years
afterward
looking
for
another
horse
that
we
wanted
to
catch
as
we
approached
the
place
where
she
had
been
captured
she
stood
stock
still
gazing
through
the
bushes
fearing
the
indian
might
still
be
hiding
there
ready
to
spring
and
she
was
so
excited
that
she
trembled
and
her
heartbeats
were
so
loud
that
i
could
hear
them
distinctly
as
i
sat
on
her
back
like
the
drumming
of
a
partridge
so
vividly
had
she
remembered
her
terrible
experiences
she
was
a
great
pet
and
favorite
with
the
whole
family
quickly
learned
playful
tricks
came
running
when
we
called
seemed
to
know
everything
we
said
to
her
and
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
our
friendly
kindness
we
used
to
cut
and
shock
and
husk
the
indian
corn
in
the
fall
until
a
keen
yankee
stopped
overnight
at
our
house
and
among
other
notions
convinced
father
that
it
was
better
to
let
it
stand
and
husk
it
at
his
leisure
during
the
winter
then
turn
in
the
cattle
to
eat
the
leaves
and
trample
down
the
stalks
so
that
they
could
be
ploughed
under
in
the
spring
in
this
winter
method
each
of
us
took
two
rows
and
husked
into
baskets
and
emptied
the
corn
on
the
ground
in
piles
of
fifteen
to
twenty
basketfuls
then
loaded
it
into
the
wagon
to
be
hauled
to
the
crib
this
was
cold
painful
work
the
temperature
being
oftentimes
far
below
zero
and
the
ground
covered
with
dry
frosty
snow
giving
rise
to
miserable
crops
of
chilblains
and
frosted
fingers
a
sad
change
from
the
merry
husking
when
the
big
yellow
pumpkins
covered
the
cleared
fields
golden
corn
golden
pumpkins
gathered
in
the
hazy
golden
weather
sad
change
indeed
but
we
occasionally
got
some
fun
out
of
the
nipping
shivery
work
from
hungry
prairie
chickens
and
squirrels
and
mice
that
came
about
us
the
piles
of
corn
were
often
left
in
the
field
several
days
and
while
loading
them
into
the
wagon
we
usually
found
field
mice
in
them
big
fellows
that
we
were
taught
to
kill
just
because
they
nibbled
a
few
grains
of
corn
i
used
to
hold
one
while
it
was
still
warm
up
to
nob
nose
for
the
fun
of
seeing
her
make
faces
and
snort
at
the
smell
of
it
and
i
would
say
here
nob
as
if
offering
her
a
lump
of
sugar
one
day
i
offered
her
an
extra
fine
fat
plump
specimen
something
like
a
little
woodchuck
or
muskrat
and
to
my
astonishment
after
smelling
it
curiously
and
doubtfully
as
if
wondering
what
the
gift
might
be
and
rubbing
it
back
and
forth
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
with
her
upper
lip
she
deliberately
took
it
into
her
mouth
crunched
and
munched
and
chewed
it
fine
and
swallowed
it
bones
teeth
head
tail
everything
not
a
single
hair
of
that
mouse
was
wasted
when
she
was
chewing
it
she
nodded
and
grunted
as
though
critically
tasting
and
relishing
it
my
father
was
a
steadfast
enthusiast
on
religious
matters
and
of
course
attended
almost
every
sort
of
especially
revival
meetings
they
were
occasionally
held
in
summer
but
mostly
in
winter
when
the
sleighing
was
good
and
plenty
of
time
available
one
hot
summer
day
father
drove
nob
to
portage
and
back
miles
over
a
sandy
road
it
was
a
hot
hard
sultry
day
work
and
she
had
evidently
been
in
order
to
get
home
in
time
for
one
of
these
meetings
i
shall
never
forget
how
tired
and
wilted
she
looked
that
evening
when
i
unhitched
her
how
she
drooped
in
her
stall
too
tired
to
eat
or
even
to
lie
down
next
morning
it
was
plain
that
her
lungs
were
inflamed
all
the
dreadful
symptoms
were
just
the
same
as
my
own
when
i
had
pneumonia
father
sent
for
a
methodist
minister
a
very
energetic
resourceful
man
who
was
a
blacksmith
farmer
butcher
and
as
well
as
minister
but
all
his
gifts
and
skill
were
of
no
avail
nob
was
doomed
we
bathed
her
head
and
tried
to
get
her
to
eat
something
but
she
could
eat
and
in
about
a
couple
of
weeks
we
turned
her
loose
to
let
her
come
around
the
house
and
see
us
in
the
weary
suffering
and
loneliness
of
the
shadow
of
death
she
tried
to
follow
us
children
so
long
her
friends
and
workmates
and
playmates
it
was
awfully
touching
she
had
several
hemorrhages
and
in
the
forenoon
of
her
last
day
after
she
had
had
one
of
her
dreadful
spells
of
bleeding
and
gasping
for
breath
she
came
to
me
trembling
with
beseeching
heartbreaking
looks
and
after
i
had
bathed
her
head
and
tried
to
soothe
and
pet
her
she
lay
down
and
gasped
and
died
all
the
family
gathered
about
her
weeping
with
aching
hearts
then
dust
to
dust
she
was
the
most
faithful
intelligent
playful
affectionate
horse
i
ever
knew
and
she
won
all
our
hearts
of
the
many
advantages
of
farm
life
for
boys
one
of
the
greatest
is
the
gaining
a
real
knowledge
of
animals
as
learning
to
respect
them
and
love
them
and
even
to
win
some
of
their
love
thus
godlike
sympathy
grows
and
thrives
and
spreads
far
beyond
the
teachings
of
churches
and
schools
where
too
often
the
mean
blinding
loveless
doctrine
is
taught
that
animals
have
neither
mind
nor
soul
have
no
rights
that
we
are
bound
to
respect
and
were
made
only
for
man
to
be
petted
spoiled
slaughtered
or
enslaved
at
first
we
were
afraid
of
snakes
but
soon
learned
that
most
of
them
were
harmless
the
only
venomous
species
seen
on
our
farm
were
the
rattlesnake
and
the
copperhead
one
of
each
david
saw
the
rattler
and
we
both
saw
the
copperhead
one
day
when
my
brother
came
in
from
his
work
he
reported
that
he
had
seen
a
snake
that
made
a
queer
buzzy
noise
with
its
tail
this
was
the
only
rattlesnake
seen
on
our
farm
though
we
heard
of
them
being
common
on
limestone
hills
eight
or
ten
miles
distant
we
discovered
the
copperhead
when
we
were
ploughing
and
we
saw
and
felt
at
the
first
long
fixed
admiring
stare
at
him
that
he
was
an
awfully
dangerous
fellow
every
fibre
of
his
strong
lithe
quivering
body
his
burnished
head
and
above
all
his
fierce
able
eyes
seemed
to
be
overflowing
full
of
deadly
power
and
bade
us
beware
and
yet
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
this
terrible
beautiful
reptile
showed
no
disposition
to
hurt
us
until
we
threw
clods
at
him
and
tried
to
head
him
off
from
a
log
fence
into
which
he
was
trying
to
escape
we
were
barefooted
and
of
course
afraid
to
let
him
get
very
near
while
we
vainly
battered
him
with
the
loose
sandy
clods
of
the
freshly
ploughed
field
to
hold
him
back
until
we
could
get
a
stick
looking
us
in
the
eyes
after
a
moment
pause
he
probably
saw
we
were
afraid
and
he
came
right
straight
at
us
snapping
and
looking
terrible
drove
us
out
of
his
way
and
won
his
fight
out
on
the
open
sandy
hills
there
were
a
good
many
thick
burly
blow
snakes
the
kind
that
puff
themselves
up
and
hiss
our
yankee
declared
that
their
breath
was
very
poisonous
and
that
we
must
not
go
near
them
a
handsome
ringed
species
common
in
damp
shady
places
was
he
told
us
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
snakes
for
if
chopped
into
pieces
however
small
the
fragments
would
wriggle
themselves
together
again
and
the
restored
snake
would
go
on
about
its
business
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
commonest
kinds
were
the
striped
slender
species
of
the
meadows
and
streams
good
swimmers
that
lived
mostly
on
frogs
once
i
observed
one
of
the
larger
ones
about
two
feet
long
pursuing
a
frog
in
our
meadow
and
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
fast
the
legless
footless
wingless
finless
hunter
could
run
the
frog
of
course
knew
its
enemy
and
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
escape
to
the
water
and
hide
in
the
marsh
mud
he
was
a
fine
sleek
yellow
muscular
fellow
and
was
springing
over
the
tall
grass
in
jumps
the
snake
gliding
swiftly
and
steadily
was
keeping
the
frog
in
sight
and
had
i
not
interfered
would
probably
have
tired
out
the
poor
jumper
then
perhaps
while
digesting
and
enjoying
his
meal
the
happy
snake
would
himself
be
swallowed
frog
and
all
by
a
hawk
again
to
our
astonishment
the
small
specimens
were
attacked
by
our
hens
they
pursued
and
pecked
away
at
them
until
they
killed
and
devoured
them
oftentimes
quarreling
over
the
division
of
the
spoil
though
it
was
not
easily
divided
we
watched
the
habits
of
the
dragonflies
wild
bees
butterflies
wasps
beetles
and
soon
learned
to
discriminate
between
those
that
might
be
safely
handled
and
the
pinching
or
stinging
species
but
of
all
our
wild
neighbors
the
mosquitoes
were
the
first
with
which
we
became
very
intimately
acquainted
the
beautiful
meadow
lying
warm
in
the
spring
sunshine
outspread
between
our
lake
and
the
that
our
shanty
stood
on
sent
forth
thirsty
swarms
of
the
little
gray
speckledy
singing
stinging
pests
and
how
tellingly
they
introduced
themselves
of
little
avail
were
the
smudges
that
we
made
on
muggy
evenings
to
drive
them
away
and
amid
the
many
lessons
which
they
insisted
upon
teaching
us
we
wondered
more
and
more
at
the
extent
of
their
knowledge
especially
that
in
their
tiny
flimsy
bodies
room
could
be
found
for
such
cunning
palates
they
would
drink
their
fill
from
brown
smoky
indians
or
from
old
white
folk
flavored
with
tobacco
and
whiskey
when
no
better
could
be
had
but
the
surpassing
fineness
of
their
taste
was
best
manifested
by
their
enthusiastic
appreciation
of
boys
full
of
lively
red
blood
and
of
girls
in
full
bloom
fresh
from
cool
scotland
or
england
on
these
it
was
pleasant
to
witness
their
enjoyment
as
they
feasted
indians
we
were
told
believed
that
if
they
were
brave
fighters
they
would
go
after
death
to
a
happy
country
abounding
in
game
where
there
were
no
mosquitoes
and
no
cowards
for
cowards
were
driven
away
by
themselves
to
a
miserable
country
where
there
was
no
game
fit
to
eat
and
where
the
sky
was
always
dark
with
huge
gnats
and
mosquitoes
as
big
as
pigeons
we
were
great
admirers
of
the
little
black
their
whole
lives
seemed
to
be
play
skimming
swimming
swirling
and
waltzing
together
in
little
groups
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
in
the
meadow
springs
dancing
to
music
we
never
could
hear
the
skaters
too
seemed
wonderful
fellows
shuffling
about
on
top
of
the
water
with
like
little
bladders
tangled
under
their
hairy
feet
and
we
often
wished
that
we
also
might
be
shod
in
the
same
way
to
enable
us
to
skate
on
the
lake
in
summer
as
well
as
in
icy
winter
not
less
wonderful
were
the
boatmen
swimming
on
their
backs
pulling
themselves
along
with
a
pair
of
legs
great
was
the
delight
of
brothers
david
and
daniel
and
myself
when
father
gave
us
a
few
pine
boards
for
a
boat
and
it
was
a
memorable
day
when
we
got
that
boat
built
and
launched
into
the
lake
never
shall
i
forget
our
first
sail
over
the
gradually
deepening
water
the
sunbeams
pouring
through
it
revealing
the
strange
plants
covering
the
bottom
and
the
fishes
coming
about
us
staring
and
wondering
as
if
the
boat
were
a
monstrous
strange
fish
the
water
was
so
clear
that
it
was
almost
invisible
and
when
we
floated
slowly
out
over
the
plants
and
fishes
we
seemed
to
be
miraculously
sustained
in
the
air
while
silently
exploring
a
veritable
fairyland
we
always
had
to
work
hard
but
if
we
worked
still
harder
we
were
occasionally
allowed
a
little
spell
in
the
long
summer
evenings
about
sundown
to
fish
and
on
sundays
an
hour
or
two
to
sail
quietly
without
or
gun
when
the
lake
was
calm
therefore
we
gradually
learned
something
about
its
inhabitants
pickerel
sunfish
black
bass
perch
shiners
ducks
loons
turtles
muskrats
etc
we
saw
the
sunfishes
making
their
nests
in
little
openings
in
the
rushes
where
the
water
was
only
a
few
feet
deep
ploughing
up
and
shoving
away
the
soft
gray
mud
with
their
noses
like
pigs
forming
round
bowls
five
or
six
inches
in
depth
and
about
two
feet
in
diameter
in
which
their
eggs
were
deposited
and
with
what
beautiful
unweariable
devotion
they
watched
and
hovered
over
them
and
chased
away
prowling
enemies
that
ventured
within
a
rod
or
two
of
the
precious
nest
the
pickerel
is
a
savage
fish
endowed
with
marvelous
strength
and
speed
it
lies
in
wait
for
its
prey
on
the
bottom
perfectly
motionless
like
a
waterlogged
stick
watching
everything
that
moves
with
fierce
hungry
eyes
oftentimes
when
we
were
fishing
for
some
other
kinds
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
a
pickerel
that
we
had
not
noticed
would
come
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
and
seize
the
fish
we
had
caught
before
we
could
get
it
into
the
boat
the
very
first
pickerel
that
i
ever
caught
jumped
into
the
air
to
seize
a
small
fish
dangling
on
my
line
and
missing
its
aim
fell
plump
into
the
boat
as
if
it
had
dropped
from
the
sky
some
of
our
neighbors
fished
for
pickerel
through
the
ice
in
midwinter
they
usually
drove
a
wagon
out
on
the
lake
set
a
large
number
of
lines
baited
with
live
minnows
hung
a
loop
of
the
lines
over
a
small
bush
planted
at
the
side
of
each
hole
and
watched
to
see
the
loops
pulled
off
when
a
fish
had
taken
the
bait
large
quantities
of
pickerel
were
often
caught
in
this
cruel
way
our
beautiful
lake
named
fountain
lake
by
father
but
muir
lake
by
the
neighbors
is
one
of
the
many
small
glacier
lakes
that
adorn
the
wisconsin
landscapes
it
is
fed
by
twenty
or
thirty
meadow
springs
is
about
half
a
mile
long
half
as
wide
and
surrounded
by
low
hills
dotted
with
oak
and
hickory
and
meadows
full
of
grasses
and
sedges
and
many
beautiful
orchids
and
ferns
first
there
is
a
zone
of
green
shining
rushes
and
just
beyond
the
rushes
a
zone
of
white
and
orange
fifty
or
sixty
feet
wide
forming
a
magnificent
border
on
bright
days
when
the
lake
was
rippled
by
a
breeze
the
lilies
and
danced
together
in
radiant
beauty
and
it
became
difficult
to
discriminate
between
them
on
sundays
after
or
before
chores
and
sermons
and
we
drifted
about
on
the
lake
for
hours
especially
in
lily
time
getting
finest
lessons
and
sermons
from
the
water
and
flowers
ducks
fishes
and
muskrats
in
particular
we
took
christ
advice
and
devoutly
considered
the
lilies
how
they
grow
up
in
beauty
out
of
gray
lime
mud
and
ride
gloriously
among
the
breezy
on
our
way
home
we
gathered
grand
bouquets
of
them
to
be
kept
fresh
all
the
week
no
flower
was
hailed
with
greater
wonder
and
admiration
by
the
european
settlers
in
general
scotch
english
and
irish
than
this
white
it
is
a
magnificent
plant
queen
of
the
inland
waters
pure
white
three
or
four
inches
in
diameter
the
most
beautiful
sumptuous
and
deliciously
fragrant
of
all
our
wisconsin
flowers
no
lily
garden
in
civilization
we
had
ever
seen
could
compare
with
our
lake
garden
the
next
most
admirable
flower
in
the
estimation
of
settlers
in
this
part
of
the
new
world
was
the
or
var
it
is
the
very
first
to
appear
in
the
spring
covering
the
cold
ground
with
cheery
blossoms
before
the
axe
or
plough
had
touched
the
oak
openings
of
wisconsin
they
were
swept
by
running
fires
almost
every
autumn
after
the
grass
became
dry
if
from
any
cause
such
as
early
snowstorms
or
late
rains
they
happened
to
escape
the
autumn
fire
besom
they
were
likely
to
be
burned
in
the
spring
after
the
snow
melted
but
whether
burned
in
the
spring
or
fall
ashes
and
bits
of
charred
twigs
and
grass
stems
made
the
whole
country
look
dismal
then
before
a
single
had
sprouted
a
hopeful
multitude
of
large
hairy
silky
buds
about
as
thick
as
one
thumb
came
to
light
pushing
up
through
the
black
and
gray
ashes
and
cinders
and
before
these
buds
were
fairly
free
from
the
ground
they
opened
wide
and
displayed
purple
blossoms
about
two
inches
in
diameter
giving
beauty
for
ashes
in
glorious
abundance
instead
of
remaining
in
the
ground
waiting
for
warm
weather
and
companions
this
admirable
plant
seemed
to
be
in
haste
to
rise
and
cheer
the
desolate
landscape
then
at
its
leisure
after
other
plants
had
come
to
its
help
it
spread
its
leaves
and
grew
up
to
a
height
of
about
two
or
three
feet
the
spreading
leaves
formed
a
whorl
on
the
ground
and
another
about
the
middle
of
the
stem
as
an
involucre
and
on
the
top
of
the
stem
the
silky
hairy
seeds
formed
a
head
like
a
second
flower
a
little
church
was
established
among
the
earlier
settlers
and
the
meetings
at
first
were
held
in
our
house
after
working
hard
all
the
week
it
was
difficult
for
boys
to
sit
still
through
long
sermons
without
falling
asleep
especially
in
warm
weather
in
this
drowsy
trouble
the
charming
anemone
came
to
our
help
a
pocketful
of
the
pungent
seeds
industriously
nibbled
while
the
discourses
were
at
their
dullest
kept
us
awake
and
filled
our
minds
with
flowers
the
next
great
flower
wonders
on
which
we
lavished
admiration
not
only
for
beauty
of
color
and
size
but
for
their
curious
shapes
were
the
cypripediums
called
or
indian
moccasins
they
were
so
different
from
the
familiar
flowers
of
old
scotland
several
species
grew
in
our
meadow
and
on
shady
hillsides
yellow
and
some
nearly
white
an
inch
or
more
in
diameter
and
shaped
exactly
like
indian
moccasins
they
caught
the
eye
of
all
the
european
settlers
and
made
them
gaze
and
wonder
like
children
and
so
did
calopogon
pogonia
spiranthes
and
many
other
fine
plant
people
that
lived
in
our
meadow
the
beautiful
growing
on
was
rare
in
our
neighborhood
but
the
orange
lily
grew
in
abundance
on
dry
ground
beneath
the
and
often
brought
aunt
ray
in
scotland
to
mind
the
with
its
brilliant
scarlet
flowers
attracted
flocks
of
butterflies
and
made
fine
masses
of
color
with
autumn
came
a
glorious
abundance
and
variety
of
asters
those
beautiful
plant
stars
together
with
goldenrods
sunflowers
daisies
and
liatris
of
different
species
while
around
the
shady
margin
of
the
meadow
many
ferns
in
beds
and
vaselike
groups
spread
their
beautiful
fronds
especially
the
osmundas
claytoniana
and
and
the
sensitive
and
ostrich
ferns
early
in
summer
we
feasted
on
strawberries
that
grew
in
rich
beds
beneath
the
meadow
grasses
and
sedges
as
well
as
in
the
dry
sunny
woods
and
in
different
bogs
and
marshes
and
around
their
borders
on
our
own
farm
and
along
the
fox
river
we
found
dewberries
and
cranberries
and
a
glorious
profusion
of
huckleberries
the
of
pies
of
wondrous
taste
and
size
colored
in
the
heart
like
sunsets
nor
were
we
slow
to
discover
the
value
of
the
hickory
trees
yielding
both
sugar
and
nuts
we
carefully
counted
the
different
kinds
on
our
farm
and
every
morning
when
we
could
steal
a
few
minutes
before
breakfast
after
doing
the
chores
we
visited
the
trees
that
had
been
wounded
by
the
axe
to
scrape
off
and
enjoy
the
thick
white
delicious
syrup
that
exuded
from
them
and
gathered
the
nuts
as
they
fell
in
the
mellow
indian
summer
making
haste
to
get
a
fair
share
with
the
sapsuckers
and
squirrels
the
hickory
makes
fine
masses
of
color
in
the
fall
every
leaf
a
flower
but
it
was
the
sweet
sap
and
sweet
nuts
that
first
interested
us
no
harvest
in
the
wisconsin
woods
was
ever
gathered
with
more
pleasure
and
care
also
to
our
delight
we
found
plenty
of
hazelnuts
and
in
a
few
places
abundance
of
wild
apples
they
were
desperately
sour
and
we
used
to
fill
our
pockets
with
them
and
dare
each
other
to
eat
one
without
making
a
face
no
easy
feat
one
hot
summer
day
father
told
us
that
we
ought
to
learn
to
swim
this
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
suggestions
he
had
ever
offered
but
precious
little
time
was
allowed
for
trips
to
the
lake
and
he
seldom
tried
to
show
us
how
go
to
the
frogs
he
said
and
they
will
give
you
all
the
lessons
you
need
watch
their
arms
and
legs
and
see
how
smoothly
they
kick
themselves
along
and
dive
and
come
up
when
you
want
to
dive
keep
your
arms
by
your
side
or
over
your
head
and
kick
and
when
you
want
to
come
up
let
your
legs
drag
and
paddle
with
your
hands
we
found
a
little
basin
among
the
rushes
at
the
south
end
of
the
lake
about
and
a
rod
or
two
wide
shaped
like
a
sunfish
nest
here
we
kicked
and
plashed
for
many
a
lesson
faithfully
trying
to
imitate
frogs
but
the
smooth
comfortable
sliding
gait
of
our
amphibious
teachers
seemed
hopelessly
hard
to
learn
when
we
tried
to
kick
down
went
our
heads
as
if
weighted
with
lead
the
moment
our
feet
left
the
ground
one
day
it
occurred
to
me
to
hold
my
breath
as
long
as
i
could
and
let
my
head
sink
as
far
as
it
liked
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
and
try
to
swim
under
the
water
instead
of
on
the
surface
this
method
was
a
great
success
for
at
the
very
first
trial
i
managed
to
cross
the
basin
without
touching
bottom
and
soon
learned
the
use
of
my
limbs
then
of
course
swimming
with
my
head
above
water
soon
became
so
easy
that
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
david
tried
the
plan
with
the
same
success
then
we
began
to
count
the
number
of
times
that
we
could
swim
around
the
basin
without
stopping
to
rest
and
after
twenty
or
thirty
rounds
failed
to
tire
us
we
proudly
thought
that
a
little
more
practice
would
make
us
about
as
amphibious
as
frogs
on
the
fourth
of
july
of
this
swimming
year
one
of
the
lawson
boys
came
to
visit
us
and
we
went
down
to
the
lake
to
spend
the
great
warm
day
with
the
fishes
and
ducks
and
turtles
after
gliding
about
on
the
smooth
mirror
water
telling
stories
and
enjoying
the
company
of
the
happy
creatures
about
us
we
rowed
to
our
and
david
and
i
went
in
for
a
swim
while
our
companion
fished
from
the
boat
a
little
way
out
beyond
the
rushes
after
a
few
turns
in
the
pool
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
now
about
time
to
try
deep
water
swimming
through
the
thick
growth
of
rushes
and
lilies
was
somewhat
dangerous
especially
for
a
beginner
because
one
arms
and
legs
might
be
entangled
among
the
long
limber
stems
nevertheless
i
ventured
and
struck
out
boldly
enough
for
the
boat
where
the
water
was
twenty
or
thirty
feet
deep
when
i
reached
the
end
of
the
little
skiff
i
raised
my
right
hand
to
take
hold
of
it
to
surprise
lawson
whose
back
was
toward
me
and
who
was
not
aware
of
my
approach
but
i
failed
to
reach
high
enough
and
of
course
the
weight
of
my
arm
and
the
stroke
against
the
overleaning
stern
of
the
boat
shoved
me
down
and
i
sank
struggling
frightened
and
confused
as
soon
as
my
feet
touched
the
bottom
i
slowly
rose
to
the
surface
but
before
i
could
get
breath
enough
to
call
for
help
sank
back
again
and
lost
all
control
of
myself
after
sinking
and
rising
i
do
know
how
many
times
some
water
got
into
my
lungs
and
i
began
to
drown
then
suddenly
my
mind
seemed
to
clear
i
remembered
that
i
could
swim
under
water
and
making
a
desperate
struggle
toward
the
shore
i
reached
a
point
where
with
my
toes
on
the
bottom
i
got
my
mouth
above
the
surface
gasped
for
help
and
was
pulled
into
the
boat
this
humiliating
accident
spoiled
the
day
and
we
all
agreed
to
keep
it
a
profound
secret
my
sister
sarah
had
heard
my
cry
for
help
and
on
our
arrival
at
the
house
inquired
what
had
happened
were
you
drowning
john
i
heard
you
cry
you
couldna
get
oot
lawson
made
haste
to
reply
oh
no
he
was
juist
haverin
making
fun
i
was
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
and
at
night
after
calmly
reviewing
the
affair
concluded
that
there
had
been
no
reasonable
cause
for
the
accident
and
that
i
ought
to
punish
myself
for
so
nearly
losing
my
life
from
unmanly
fear
accordingly
at
the
very
first
opportunity
i
stole
away
to
the
lake
by
myself
got
into
my
boat
and
instead
of
going
back
to
the
old
for
further
practice
or
to
try
to
do
sanely
and
well
what
i
had
so
ignominiously
failed
to
do
in
my
first
adventure
that
is
to
swim
out
through
the
rushes
and
lilies
i
rowed
directly
out
to
the
middle
of
the
lake
stripped
stood
up
on
the
seat
in
the
stern
and
with
grim
deliberation
took
a
header
and
dove
straight
down
thirty
or
forty
feet
turned
easily
and
letting
my
feet
drag
paddled
straight
to
the
surface
with
my
hands
as
father
had
at
first
directed
me
to
do
i
then
swam
round
the
boat
glorying
in
my
suddenly
acquired
confidence
and
victory
over
myself
climbed
into
it
and
dived
again
with
the
same
triumphant
success
i
think
i
went
down
four
or
five
times
and
each
time
as
i
made
the
shouted
aloud
take
that
feeling
that
i
was
getting
most
gloriously
even
with
myself
never
again
from
that
day
to
this
have
i
lost
control
of
myself
in
water
if
suddenly
thrown
overboard
at
sea
in
the
dark
or
even
while
asleep
i
think
i
would
immediately
right
myself
in
a
way
some
would
call
instinct
rise
among
the
waves
catch
my
breath
and
try
to
plan
what
would
better
be
done
never
was
victory
over
self
more
complete
i
have
been
a
good
swimmer
ever
since
at
a
slow
gait
i
think
i
could
swim
all
day
in
smooth
water
moderate
in
temperature
when
i
was
a
student
at
madison
i
used
to
go
on
long
called
exploring
expeditions
along
the
south
shore
of
lake
mendota
on
saturdays
sometimes
alone
sometimes
with
another
amphibious
explorer
by
the
name
of
fuller
my
adventures
in
fountain
lake
call
to
mind
the
story
of
a
boy
who
in
climbing
a
tree
to
rob
a
crow
nest
fell
and
broke
his
leg
but
as
soon
as
it
healed
compelled
himself
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
tree
he
had
fallen
from
like
scotch
children
in
general
we
were
taught
grim
in
season
and
out
of
season
to
mortify
the
flesh
keep
our
bodies
in
subjection
to
bible
laws
and
mercilessly
punish
ourselves
for
every
fault
imagined
or
committed
a
little
boy
while
helping
his
sister
to
drive
home
the
cows
happened
to
use
a
forbidden
word
i
have
to
tell
fayther
on
ye
said
the
horrified
sister
i
tell
him
that
ye
said
a
bad
word
weel
said
the
boy
by
way
of
excuse
i
couldna
help
the
word
comin
into
me
and
it
na
waur
to
speak
it
oot
than
to
let
it
rin
through
ye
a
scotch
fiddler
playing
at
a
wedding
drank
so
much
whiskey
that
on
the
way
home
he
fell
by
the
roadside
in
the
morning
he
was
ashamed
and
angry
and
determined
to
punish
himself
making
haste
to
the
house
of
a
friend
a
gamekeeper
he
called
him
out
and
requested
the
loan
of
a
gun
the
alarmed
gamekeeper
not
liking
the
fiddler
looks
and
voice
anxiously
inquired
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
surely
said
he
you
no
gan
to
shoot
yoursel
with
characteristic
candor
replied
the
penitent
fiddler
i
dinna
think
that
i
juist
exactly
kill
mysel
but
i
gaun
to
tak
a
dander
doon
the
burn
brook
wi
the
gun
and
gie
mysel
a
deevil
o
a
fleg
fright
one
calm
summer
evening
a
woodpecker
was
drowned
in
our
lake
the
accident
happened
at
the
south
end
opposite
our
memorable
a
few
rods
from
the
place
where
i
came
so
near
being
drowned
years
before
i
had
returned
to
the
old
home
during
a
summer
vacation
of
the
state
university
and
having
made
a
beginning
in
botany
i
was
of
course
full
of
enthusiasm
and
ran
eagerly
to
my
beloved
pogonia
calopogon
and
cypripedium
gardens
osmunda
ferneries
and
the
lake
lilies
and
a
little
before
sundown
the
died
away
and
the
lake
reflecting
the
wooded
hills
like
a
mirror
was
dimpled
and
dotted
and
streaked
here
and
there
where
fishes
and
turtles
were
poking
out
their
heads
and
muskrats
were
sculling
themselves
along
with
their
flat
tails
making
glittering
tracks
after
lingering
a
while
dreamily
recalling
the
old
hard
days
and
watching
my
favorite
woodpeckers
pursuing
moths
like
regular
flycatchers
i
swam
out
through
the
rushes
and
up
the
middle
of
the
lake
to
the
north
end
and
back
gliding
slowly
looking
about
me
enjoying
the
scenery
as
i
would
in
a
saunter
along
the
shore
and
studying
the
habits
of
the
animals
as
they
were
explained
and
recorded
on
the
smooth
glassy
water
illustration
clock
the
star
hand
rising
and
setting
with
the
sun
all
the
year
invented
by
the
author
in
his
boyhood
on
the
way
back
when
i
was
within
a
hundred
rods
or
so
of
the
end
of
my
voyage
i
noticed
a
peculiar
plashing
disturbance
that
could
not
i
thought
be
made
by
a
jumping
fish
or
any
other
inhabitant
of
the
lake
for
instead
of
low
regular
ripples
such
as
are
made
by
the
popping
up
of
a
head
or
like
those
raised
by
the
quick
splash
of
a
leaping
fish
or
diving
loon
or
muskrat
a
continuous
struggle
was
kept
up
for
several
minutes
ere
the
outspreading
interfering
began
to
die
away
swimming
hastily
to
the
spot
to
try
to
discover
what
had
happened
i
found
one
of
my
woodpeckers
floating
motionless
with
outspread
wings
all
was
over
had
i
been
a
minute
or
two
earlier
i
might
have
saved
him
he
had
glanced
on
the
water
i
suppose
in
pursuit
of
a
moth
was
unable
to
rise
from
it
and
died
struggling
as
i
nearly
did
at
this
same
spot
like
me
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
mind
in
blind
confusion
and
fear
the
water
was
warm
and
had
he
kept
still
with
his
head
a
little
above
the
surface
he
would
sooner
or
later
have
been
wafted
ashore
the
best
aimed
flights
of
birds
and
man
gang
aft
agley
but
this
was
the
first
case
i
had
witnessed
of
a
bird
losing
its
life
by
drowning
doubtless
accidents
to
animals
are
far
more
common
than
is
generally
known
i
have
seen
quails
killed
by
flying
against
our
house
when
suddenly
startled
some
birds
get
entangled
in
hairs
of
their
own
nests
and
die
once
i
found
a
poor
snipe
in
our
meadow
that
was
unable
to
fly
on
account
of
difficult
pitying
the
poor
mother
i
picked
her
up
out
of
the
grass
and
helped
her
as
gently
as
i
could
and
as
soon
as
the
egg
was
born
she
flew
gladly
away
oftentimes
i
have
thought
it
strange
that
one
could
walk
through
the
woods
and
mountains
and
plains
for
years
without
seeing
a
single
most
wild
animals
get
into
the
world
and
out
of
it
without
being
noticed
nevertheless
we
at
last
sadly
learn
that
they
are
all
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
like
ourselves
many
birds
lose
their
lives
in
storms
i
remember
a
particularly
severe
wisconsin
winter
when
the
temperature
was
many
degrees
below
zero
and
the
snow
was
deep
preventing
the
quail
which
feed
on
the
ground
from
getting
anything
like
enough
of
food
as
was
pitifully
shown
by
a
flock
i
found
on
our
farm
frozen
solid
in
a
thicket
of
oak
sprouts
they
were
in
a
circle
about
a
foot
wide
with
their
heads
outward
packed
close
together
for
warmth
yet
all
had
died
without
a
struggle
perhaps
more
from
starvation
than
frost
many
small
birds
lose
their
lives
in
the
storms
of
early
spring
or
even
summer
one
mild
spring
morning
i
picked
up
more
than
a
score
out
of
the
grass
and
flowers
most
of
them
darling
singers
that
had
perished
in
a
sudden
storm
of
sleety
rain
and
hail
in
a
hollow
at
the
foot
of
an
oak
tree
that
i
had
chopped
down
one
cold
winter
day
i
found
a
poor
ground
squirrel
frozen
solid
in
its
snug
grassy
nest
in
the
middle
of
a
store
of
nearly
a
peck
of
wheat
it
had
carefully
gathered
i
carried
it
home
and
gradually
thawed
and
warmed
it
in
the
kitchen
hoping
it
would
come
to
life
like
a
pickerel
i
caught
in
our
lake
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
which
after
being
frozen
as
hard
as
a
bone
and
thawed
at
the
fireside
squirmed
itself
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
cook
when
she
began
to
scrape
it
bounced
off
the
table
and
danced
about
on
the
floor
making
wonderful
springy
jumps
as
if
trying
to
find
its
way
back
home
to
the
lake
but
for
the
poor
spermophile
nothing
i
could
do
in
the
way
of
revival
was
of
any
avail
its
life
had
passed
away
without
the
slightest
struggle
as
it
lay
asleep
curled
up
like
a
ball
with
its
tail
wrapped
about
it
iv
a
paradise
of
birds
bird
favorites
the
prairie
chickens
a
loon
on
the
defensive
passenger
pigeons
the
wisconsin
oak
openings
were
a
summer
paradise
for
song
birds
and
a
fine
place
to
get
acquainted
with
them
for
the
trees
stood
wide
apart
allowing
one
to
see
the
happy
homeseekers
as
they
arrived
in
the
spring
their
mating
the
brooding
and
feeding
of
the
young
and
after
they
were
and
strong
to
see
all
the
families
of
the
neighborhood
gathering
and
getting
ready
to
leave
in
the
fall
excepting
the
geese
and
ducks
and
pigeons
nearly
all
our
summer
birds
arrived
singly
or
in
small
draggled
flocks
but
when
frost
and
falling
leaves
brought
their
winter
homes
to
mind
they
assembled
in
large
flocks
on
dead
or
leafless
trees
by
the
side
of
a
meadow
or
field
perhaps
to
get
acquainted
and
talk
the
thing
over
some
species
held
regular
daily
meetings
for
several
weeks
before
finally
setting
forth
on
their
long
southern
journeys
strange
to
say
we
never
saw
them
start
some
morning
we
would
find
them
gone
doubtless
they
migrated
in
the
night
time
comparatively
few
species
remained
all
winter
the
nuthatch
chickadee
owl
prairie
chicken
quail
and
a
few
stragglers
from
the
main
flocks
of
ducks
jays
hawks
and
bluebirds
only
after
the
country
was
settled
did
either
jays
or
bluebirds
winter
with
us
the
brave
chickadees
and
nuthatches
stayed
all
the
year
wholly
independent
of
farms
and
man
food
and
affairs
with
the
first
hints
of
spring
came
the
brave
little
bluebirds
darling
singers
as
blue
as
the
best
sky
and
of
course
we
all
loved
them
their
rich
crispy
warbling
is
perfectly
delightful
soothing
and
cheering
sweet
and
whisperingly
low
nature
fine
love
touches
every
note
going
straight
home
into
one
heart
and
withal
they
are
hardy
and
brave
fearless
fighters
in
defense
of
home
when
we
boys
approached
their
nests
the
bold
little
fellows
kept
scolding
and
diving
at
us
and
tried
to
strike
us
in
the
face
and
oftentimes
we
were
afraid
they
would
prick
our
eyes
but
the
boldness
of
the
little
housekeepers
only
made
us
love
them
the
more
none
of
the
bird
people
of
wisconsin
welcomed
us
more
heartily
than
the
common
robin
far
from
showing
alarm
at
the
coming
of
settlers
into
their
native
woods
they
reared
their
young
around
our
gardens
as
if
they
liked
us
and
how
heartily
we
admired
the
beauty
and
fine
manners
of
these
graceful
birds
and
their
loud
cheery
song
of
not
fear
not
cheer
up
cheer
it
was
easy
to
love
them
for
they
reminded
us
of
the
robin
redbreast
of
scotland
like
the
bluebirds
they
dared
every
danger
in
defense
of
home
and
we
often
wondered
that
birds
so
gentle
could
be
so
bold
and
that
singers
could
so
fiercely
fight
and
scold
of
all
the
great
singers
that
sweeten
wisconsin
one
of
the
best
known
and
best
loved
is
the
brown
thrush
or
thrasher
strong
and
able
without
being
familiar
and
easily
seen
and
heard
rosy
purple
evenings
after
thundershowers
are
the
favorite
when
the
winds
have
died
away
and
the
steaming
ground
and
the
leaves
and
flowers
fill
the
air
with
fragrance
then
the
male
makes
haste
to
the
topmost
spray
of
an
oak
tree
and
sings
loud
and
clear
with
delightful
enthusiasm
until
sundown
mostly
i
suppose
for
his
mate
sitting
on
the
precious
eggs
in
a
brush
heap
and
how
faithful
and
watchful
and
daring
he
is
woe
to
the
snake
or
squirrel
that
ventured
to
go
nigh
the
nest
we
often
saw
him
diving
on
them
pecking
them
about
the
head
and
driving
them
away
as
bravely
as
the
kingbird
drives
away
hawks
their
rich
and
varied
strains
make
the
air
fairly
quiver
we
boys
often
tried
to
interpret
the
wild
ringing
melody
and
put
it
into
words
after
the
arrival
of
the
thrushes
came
the
bobolinks
gushing
gurgling
inexhaustible
fountains
of
song
pouring
forth
floods
of
sweet
notes
over
the
broad
fox
river
meadows
in
wonderful
variety
and
volume
crowded
and
mixed
beyond
description
as
they
hovered
on
quivering
wings
above
their
hidden
nests
in
the
grass
it
seemed
marvelous
to
us
that
birds
so
moderate
in
size
could
hold
so
much
of
this
wonderful
song
stuff
each
one
of
them
poured
forth
music
enough
for
a
whole
flock
singing
as
if
its
whole
body
feathers
and
all
were
made
up
of
music
flowing
glowing
bubbling
melody
interpenetrated
here
and
there
with
small
scintillating
prickles
and
spicules
we
never
became
so
intimately
acquainted
with
the
bobolinks
as
with
the
thrushes
for
they
lived
far
out
on
the
broad
fox
river
meadows
while
the
thrushes
sang
on
the
around
every
home
the
bobolinks
were
among
the
first
of
our
great
singers
to
leave
us
in
the
fall
going
apparently
direct
to
the
of
the
southern
states
where
they
grew
fat
and
were
slaughtered
in
countless
numbers
for
food
sad
fate
for
singers
so
purely
divine
one
of
the
gayest
of
the
singers
is
the
redwing
blackbird
in
the
spring
when
his
scarlet
epaulets
shine
brightest
and
his
little
modest
gray
wife
is
sitting
on
the
nest
built
on
rushes
in
a
swamp
he
sits
on
a
nearby
oak
and
devotedly
sings
almost
all
day
his
rich
simple
strain
is
or
as
interpreted
by
some
in
summer
after
nesting
cares
are
over
they
assemble
in
flocks
of
hundreds
and
thousands
to
feast
on
indian
corn
when
it
is
in
the
milk
scattering
over
a
field
each
selects
an
ear
strips
the
husk
down
far
enough
to
lay
bare
an
inch
or
two
of
the
end
of
it
enjoys
an
exhilarating
feast
and
after
all
are
full
they
rise
simultaneously
with
a
quick
birr
of
wings
like
an
church
congregation
fluttering
to
their
feet
when
the
minister
after
giving
out
the
hymn
says
let
the
congregation
arise
and
sing
alighting
on
nearby
trees
they
sing
with
a
hearty
vengeance
bursting
out
without
any
puttering
prelude
in
gloriously
glad
concert
hundreds
or
thousands
of
exulting
voices
with
sweet
gurgling
mingled
with
chippy
vibrant
and
exploding
globules
of
musical
notes
making
a
most
enthusiastic
indescribable
a
combination
unlike
anything
to
be
heard
elsewhere
in
the
bird
kingdom
something
like
bagpipes
flutes
violins
pianos
and
voices
all
bursting
and
bubbling
at
once
then
suddenly
some
one
of
the
joyful
congregation
shouts
chirr
chirr
and
all
stop
as
if
shot
the
meadowlark
with
its
placid
simple
song
of
was
another
favorite
and
we
soon
learned
to
admire
the
baltimore
oriole
and
its
wonderful
hanging
nests
and
the
scarlet
tanager
glowing
like
fire
amid
the
green
leaves
but
no
singer
of
them
all
got
farther
into
our
hearts
than
the
little
song
sparrow
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
and
begin
and
singing
the
richness
sweetness
and
pathos
of
this
small
darling
song
as
he
sat
on
a
low
bush
often
brought
tears
to
our
eyes
the
little
cheery
modest
chickadee
midget
loved
by
every
innocent
boy
and
girl
man
and
woman
and
by
many
not
altogether
innocent
was
one
of
the
first
of
the
birds
to
attract
our
attention
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
us
as
the
winter
advanced
bravely
singing
his
faint
silvery
lisping
tinkling
notes
ending
with
a
bright
dee
however
frosty
the
weather
the
nuthatches
who
also
stayed
all
winter
with
us
were
favorites
with
us
boys
we
loved
to
watch
them
as
they
traced
the
of
the
oaks
and
hickories
head
downward
deftly
flicking
off
loose
scales
and
splinters
in
search
of
insects
and
braving
the
coldest
weather
as
if
their
little
sparks
of
life
were
as
safely
warm
in
winter
as
in
summer
unquenchable
by
the
severest
frost
with
the
help
of
the
chickadees
they
made
a
delightful
stir
in
the
solemn
winter
days
and
when
we
were
out
chopping
we
never
ceased
to
wonder
how
their
slender
naked
toes
could
be
kept
warm
when
our
own
were
so
painfully
frosted
though
clad
in
thick
socks
and
boots
and
we
wondered
and
admired
the
more
when
we
thought
of
the
little
midgets
sleeping
in
when
the
temperature
was
far
below
zero
sometimes
degrees
below
and
in
the
morning
after
a
minute
breakfast
of
a
few
frozen
insects
and
hoarfrost
crystals
playing
and
chatting
in
cheery
tones
as
if
food
weather
and
everything
was
according
to
their
own
warm
hearts
our
yankee
told
us
that
the
name
of
this
darling
was
their
big
neighbors
the
owls
also
made
good
winter
music
singing
out
loud
in
wild
gallant
strains
bespeaking
brave
comfort
let
the
frost
bite
as
it
might
the
solemn
hooting
of
the
species
with
the
widest
throat
seemed
to
us
the
very
wildest
of
all
the
winter
sounds
prairie
chickens
came
strolling
in
family
flocks
about
the
shanty
picking
seeds
and
grasshoppers
like
domestic
fowls
and
they
became
still
more
abundant
as
were
multiplied
but
also
wilder
of
course
when
every
shotgun
in
the
country
was
aimed
at
them
the
booming
of
the
males
during
the
was
one
of
the
loudest
and
strangest
of
the
early
spring
sounds
being
easily
heard
on
calm
mornings
at
a
distance
of
a
half
or
three
fourths
of
a
mile
as
soon
as
the
snow
was
off
the
ground
they
assembled
in
flocks
of
a
dozen
or
two
on
an
open
spot
usually
on
the
side
of
a
ploughed
field
ruffled
up
their
feathers
inflated
the
curious
colored
sacks
on
the
sides
of
their
necks
and
strutted
about
with
queer
gestures
something
like
turkey
gobblers
uttering
strange
loud
rounded
drumming
calls
boom
boom
interrupted
by
choking
sounds
my
brother
daniel
caught
one
while
she
was
sitting
on
her
nest
in
our
the
young
are
just
like
domestic
chicks
run
with
the
mother
as
soon
as
hatched
and
stay
with
her
until
autumn
feeding
on
the
ground
never
taking
wing
unless
disturbed
in
winter
when
they
assemble
in
large
flocks
fly
about
sundown
to
selected
on
tall
trees
and
to
in
the
morning
unhusked
if
any
are
to
be
found
in
the
neighborhood
or
thickets
of
dwarf
birch
and
willows
the
buds
of
which
furnish
a
considerable
part
of
their
food
when
snow
covers
the
ground
the
wild
along
the
fox
river
and
around
pucaway
lake
were
the
summer
homes
of
millions
of
ducks
and
in
the
indian
summer
when
the
rice
was
ripe
they
grew
very
fat
the
magnificent
mallards
in
particular
afforded
our
yankee
neighbors
royal
feasts
almost
without
price
for
often
as
many
as
a
were
killed
at
a
shot
but
we
seldom
were
allowed
a
single
hour
for
hunting
and
so
got
very
few
the
autumn
duck
season
was
a
glad
time
for
the
indians
also
for
they
feasted
and
grew
fat
not
only
on
the
ducks
but
on
the
wild
rice
large
quantities
of
which
they
gathered
as
they
glided
through
the
midst
of
the
generous
crop
in
canoes
bending
down
handfuls
over
the
sides
and
beating
out
the
grain
with
small
paddles
the
warmth
of
the
deep
spring
fountains
of
the
creek
in
our
meadow
kept
it
open
all
the
year
and
a
few
pairs
of
wood
ducks
the
most
beautiful
we
thought
of
all
the
ducks
wintered
in
it
i
well
remember
the
first
specimen
i
ever
saw
father
shot
it
in
the
creek
during
a
snowstorm
brought
it
into
the
house
and
called
us
around
him
saying
come
bairns
and
admire
the
work
of
god
displayed
in
this
bonnie
bird
naebody
but
god
could
paint
feathers
like
these
juist
look
at
the
colors
hoo
they
shine
and
hoo
fine
they
overlap
and
blend
thegether
like
the
colors
o
the
rainbow
and
we
all
agreed
that
never
never
before
had
we
seen
so
awfu
bonnie
a
bird
a
pair
nested
every
year
in
the
hollow
top
of
an
oak
stump
about
fifteen
feet
high
that
stood
on
the
side
of
the
meadow
and
we
used
to
wonder
how
they
got
the
fluffy
young
ones
down
from
the
nest
and
across
the
meadow
to
the
lake
when
they
were
only
helpless
featherless
midgets
whether
the
mother
carried
them
to
the
water
on
her
back
or
in
her
mouth
i
never
saw
the
thing
done
or
found
anybody
who
had
until
this
summer
when
holabird
a
keen
observer
told
me
that
he
once
saw
the
mother
carry
them
from
the
nest
tree
in
her
mouth
quickly
coming
and
going
to
a
nearby
stream
and
in
a
few
minutes
get
them
all
together
and
proudly
sail
away
sometimes
a
flock
of
swans
were
seen
passing
over
at
a
great
height
on
their
long
journeys
and
we
admired
their
clear
bugle
notes
but
they
seldom
visited
any
of
the
lakes
in
our
neighborhood
so
seldom
that
when
they
did
it
was
talked
of
for
years
one
was
shot
by
a
blacksmith
on
a
millpond
with
a
sharp
rifle
and
many
of
the
neighbors
went
far
to
see
it
the
common
gray
goose
canada
honker
flying
in
regular
flocks
was
one
of
the
wildest
and
wariest
of
all
the
large
birds
that
enlivened
the
spring
and
autumn
they
seldom
ventured
to
alight
in
our
small
lake
fearing
i
suppose
that
hunters
might
be
concealed
in
the
rushes
but
on
account
of
their
fondness
for
the
young
leaves
of
winter
wheat
when
they
were
a
few
inches
high
they
often
alighted
on
our
fields
when
passing
on
their
way
south
and
occasionally
even
in
our
when
a
snowstorm
was
blowing
and
they
were
hungry
and
with
nearly
an
inch
of
snow
on
their
backs
in
such
times
of
distress
we
used
to
pity
them
even
while
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
them
they
were
exceedingly
cautious
and
circumspect
usually
flew
several
times
round
the
adjacent
thickets
and
fences
to
make
sure
that
no
enemy
was
near
before
settling
down
and
one
always
stood
on
guard
relieved
from
time
to
time
while
the
flock
was
feeding
therefore
there
was
no
chance
to
creep
up
on
them
unobserved
you
had
to
be
well
hidden
before
the
flock
arrived
it
was
the
ambition
of
boys
to
be
able
to
shoot
these
wary
birds
i
never
got
but
two
both
of
them
at
one
lucky
shot
when
i
ran
to
pick
them
up
one
of
them
flew
away
but
as
the
poor
fellow
was
sorely
wounded
he
did
fly
far
when
i
caught
him
after
a
short
chase
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
of
terror
and
despair
which
the
leader
of
the
flock
heard
at
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
rods
they
had
flown
off
in
frightened
disorder
of
course
but
had
got
into
the
regular
order
when
the
leader
heard
the
cry
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
bravely
he
left
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
flock
and
hurried
back
screaming
and
struck
at
me
in
trying
to
save
his
companion
i
dodged
down
and
held
my
hands
over
my
head
and
thus
escaped
a
blow
of
his
elbows
fortunately
i
had
left
my
gun
at
the
fence
and
the
life
of
this
noble
bird
was
spared
after
he
had
risked
it
in
trying
to
save
his
wounded
friend
or
neighbor
or
family
relation
for
so
shy
a
bird
boldly
to
attack
a
hunter
showed
wonderful
sympathy
and
courage
this
is
one
of
my
strangest
hunting
experiences
never
before
had
i
regarded
wild
geese
as
dangerous
or
capable
of
such
noble
devotion
the
loud
clear
call
of
the
handsome
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
and
most
characteristic
of
our
spring
sounds
and
we
soon
learned
to
imitate
it
so
well
that
a
bold
cock
often
accepted
our
challenge
and
came
flying
to
fight
the
young
run
as
soon
as
they
are
hatched
and
follow
their
parents
until
spring
roosting
on
the
ground
in
a
close
bunch
heads
out
ready
to
scatter
and
fly
these
fine
birds
were
seldom
seen
when
we
first
arrived
in
the
wilderness
but
when
supplied
abundance
of
food
they
multiplied
very
fast
although
oftentimes
sore
pressed
during
hard
winters
when
the
snow
reached
a
depth
of
two
or
three
feet
covering
their
food
while
the
mercury
fell
to
twenty
or
thirty
degrees
below
zero
occasionally
although
shy
on
account
of
being
persistently
hunted
under
pressure
of
extreme
hunger
in
the
very
coldest
weather
when
the
snow
was
deepest
they
ventured
into
barnyards
and
even
approached
the
doorsteps
of
houses
searching
for
any
sort
of
scraps
and
crumbs
as
if
piteously
begging
for
food
one
of
our
neighbors
saw
a
flock
come
creeping
up
through
the
snow
unable
to
fly
hardly
able
to
walk
and
while
approaching
the
door
several
of
them
actually
fell
down
and
died
showing
that
birds
usually
so
vigorous
and
apparently
independent
of
fortune
suffer
and
lose
their
lives
in
extreme
weather
like
the
rest
of
us
frozen
to
death
like
settlers
caught
in
blizzards
none
of
our
neighbors
perished
in
storms
though
many
had
feet
ears
and
fingers
or
solidly
frozen
as
soon
as
the
lake
ice
melted
we
heard
the
lonely
cry
of
the
loon
one
of
the
wildest
and
most
striking
of
all
the
wilderness
sounds
a
strange
sad
mournful
unearthly
cry
half
laughing
half
wailing
nevertheless
the
great
northern
diver
as
our
species
is
called
is
a
brave
hardy
beautiful
bird
able
to
fly
under
water
about
as
well
as
above
it
and
to
spear
and
capture
the
swiftest
fishes
for
food
those
that
haunted
our
lake
were
so
wary
none
was
shot
for
years
though
every
boy
hunter
in
the
neighborhood
was
ambitious
to
get
one
to
prove
his
skill
on
one
of
our
bitter
cold
new
year
holidays
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
loon
in
the
small
open
part
of
the
lake
at
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
that
was
kept
from
freezing
by
the
warm
spring
water
i
knew
that
it
could
not
fly
out
of
so
small
a
place
for
these
heavy
birds
have
to
beat
the
water
for
half
a
mile
or
so
before
they
can
get
fairly
on
the
wing
their
narrow
finlike
wings
are
very
small
as
compared
with
the
weight
of
the
body
and
are
evidently
made
for
flying
through
water
as
well
as
through
the
air
and
it
is
by
means
of
their
swift
flight
through
the
water
and
the
swiftness
of
the
blow
they
strike
with
their
long
bills
that
they
are
able
to
capture
the
fishes
on
which
they
feed
i
ran
down
the
meadow
with
the
gun
got
into
my
boat
and
pursued
that
poor
straggler
of
course
he
dived
again
and
again
but
had
to
come
up
to
breathe
and
i
at
length
got
a
quick
shot
at
his
head
and
slightly
wounded
or
stunned
him
caught
him
and
ran
proudly
back
to
the
house
with
my
prize
i
carried
him
in
my
arms
he
did
struggle
to
get
away
or
offer
to
strike
me
and
when
i
put
him
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
kitchen
stove
he
just
rested
quietly
on
his
belly
as
noiseless
and
motionless
as
if
he
were
a
stuffed
specimen
on
a
shelf
held
his
neck
erect
gave
no
sign
of
suffering
from
any
wound
and
though
he
was
motionless
his
small
black
eyes
seemed
to
be
ever
keenly
watchful
his
formidable
bill
very
sharp
three
or
three
and
a
half
inches
long
and
shaped
like
a
pickaxe
was
held
perfectly
level
but
the
wonder
was
that
he
did
not
struggle
or
make
the
slightest
movement
we
had
a
cat
an
old
tom
of
great
experience
who
was
so
fond
of
lying
under
the
stove
in
frosty
weather
that
it
was
difficult
even
to
poke
him
out
with
a
broom
but
when
he
saw
and
smelled
that
strange
big
fishy
black
and
white
speckledy
bird
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
before
seen
he
rushed
wildly
to
the
farther
corner
of
the
kitchen
looked
back
cautiously
and
suspiciously
and
began
to
make
a
careful
study
of
the
handsome
but
stranger
becoming
more
and
more
curious
and
interested
he
at
length
advanced
a
step
or
two
for
a
nearer
view
and
nearer
smell
and
as
the
wonderful
bird
kept
absolutely
motionless
he
was
encouraged
to
venture
gradually
nearer
and
nearer
until
within
perhaps
five
or
six
feet
of
its
breast
then
the
wary
loon
not
liking
tom
looks
in
so
near
a
view
which
perhaps
recalled
to
his
mind
the
plundering
minks
and
muskrats
he
had
to
fight
when
they
approached
his
nest
prepared
to
defend
himself
by
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
drawing
back
his
long
pickaxe
bill
and
without
the
slightest
fuss
or
stir
held
it
level
and
ready
just
over
his
tail
with
that
dangerous
bill
drawn
so
far
back
out
of
the
way
tom
confidence
in
the
stranger
peaceful
intentions
seemed
almost
complete
and
thus
encouraged
he
at
last
ventured
forward
with
wondering
questioning
eyes
and
quivering
nostrils
until
he
was
only
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
from
the
loon
smooth
white
breast
when
the
beautiful
bird
apparently
as
peaceful
and
inoffensive
as
a
flower
saw
that
his
hairy
yellow
enemy
had
arrived
at
the
right
distance
the
loon
who
evidently
was
a
fine
judge
of
the
reach
of
his
spear
shot
it
forward
quick
as
a
in
marvelous
contrast
to
the
wonderful
slowness
of
the
preparatory
poising
backward
motion
the
aim
was
true
to
a
tom
was
struck
right
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
between
the
eyes
i
thought
his
skull
was
cracked
perhaps
it
was
the
sudden
astonishment
of
that
outraged
cat
the
virtuous
indignation
and
wrath
terror
and
pain
are
far
beyond
description
his
eyes
and
screams
and
desperate
retreat
told
all
that
when
the
blow
was
received
he
made
a
noise
that
i
never
heard
a
cat
make
before
or
since
an
awfully
deep
condensed
screechy
explosive
as
he
bounced
straight
up
in
the
air
like
a
bucking
bronco
and
when
he
alighted
after
his
spring
he
rushed
madly
across
the
room
and
made
frantic
efforts
to
climb
up
the
plaster
wall
not
satisfied
to
get
the
width
of
the
kitchen
away
from
his
mysterious
enemy
for
the
first
time
that
cold
winter
he
tried
to
get
out
of
the
house
anyhow
anywhere
out
of
that
room
when
he
finally
ventured
to
look
back
and
saw
that
the
barbarous
bird
was
still
there
tranquil
and
motionless
in
front
of
the
stove
he
regained
command
of
some
of
his
shattered
senses
and
carefully
commenced
to
examine
his
wound
backed
against
the
wall
in
the
farthest
corner
and
keeping
his
eye
on
the
outrageous
bird
he
tenderly
touched
and
washed
the
sore
spot
wetting
his
paw
with
his
tongue
pausing
now
and
then
as
his
courage
increased
to
glare
and
stare
and
growl
at
his
enemy
with
looks
and
tones
wonderfully
human
as
if
saying
you
confounded
fishy
unfair
rascal
what
did
you
do
that
for
what
had
i
done
to
you
faithless
legless
wretch
intense
experiences
like
the
above
bring
out
the
humanity
that
is
in
all
animals
one
touch
of
nature
even
a
touch
makes
all
the
world
kin
it
was
a
great
memorable
day
when
the
first
flock
of
passenger
pigeons
came
to
our
farm
calling
to
mind
the
story
we
had
read
about
them
when
we
were
at
school
in
scotland
of
all
god
feathered
people
that
sailed
the
wisconsin
sky
no
other
bird
seemed
to
us
so
wonderful
the
beautiful
wanderers
flew
like
the
winds
in
flocks
of
millions
from
climate
to
climate
in
accord
with
the
weather
finding
their
food
acorns
beechnuts
cranberries
strawberries
huckleberries
juniper
berries
hackberries
buckwheat
rice
wheat
oats
corn
in
fields
and
forests
thousands
of
miles
apart
i
have
seen
flocks
streaming
south
in
the
fall
so
large
that
they
were
flowing
over
from
horizon
to
horizon
in
an
almost
continuous
stream
all
day
long
at
the
rate
of
forty
or
fifty
miles
an
hour
like
a
mighty
river
in
the
sky
widening
contracting
descending
like
falls
and
cataracts
and
rising
suddenly
here
and
there
in
huge
ragged
masses
like
spray
how
wonderful
the
distances
they
flew
in
a
day
in
a
year
in
a
lifetime
they
arrived
in
wisconsin
in
the
spring
just
after
the
sun
had
cleared
away
the
snow
and
alighted
in
the
woods
to
feed
on
the
fallen
acorns
that
they
had
missed
the
previous
autumn
a
comparatively
small
flock
swept
thousands
of
acres
perfectly
clean
of
acorns
in
a
few
minutes
by
moving
straight
ahead
with
a
broad
front
all
got
their
share
for
the
rear
constantly
became
the
van
by
flying
over
the
flock
and
alighting
in
front
the
entire
flock
constantly
changing
from
rear
to
front
revolving
something
like
a
wheel
with
a
low
buzzing
wing
roar
that
could
be
heard
a
long
way
off
in
summer
they
feasted
on
wheat
and
oats
and
were
easily
approached
as
they
rested
on
the
trees
along
the
sides
of
the
field
after
a
good
full
meal
displaying
beautiful
iridescent
colors
as
they
moved
their
necks
backward
and
forward
when
we
went
very
near
them
every
shotgun
was
aimed
at
them
and
everybody
feasted
on
pigeon
pies
and
not
a
few
of
the
settlers
feasted
also
on
the
beauty
of
the
wonderful
birds
the
breast
of
the
male
is
a
fine
rosy
red
the
lower
part
of
the
neck
behind
and
along
the
sides
changing
from
the
red
of
the
breast
to
gold
emerald
green
and
rich
crimson
the
general
color
of
the
upper
parts
is
grayish
blue
the
under
parts
white
the
extreme
length
of
the
bird
is
about
seventeen
inches
the
finely
modeled
slender
tail
about
eight
inches
and
extent
of
wings
inches
the
females
are
scarcely
less
beautiful
oh
what
bonnie
bonnie
birds
we
exclaimed
over
the
first
that
fell
into
our
hands
oh
what
colors
look
at
their
breasts
bonnie
as
roses
and
at
their
necks
aglow
wi
every
color
juist
like
the
wonderfu
wood
ducks
oh
the
bonnie
bonnie
creatures
they
beat
a
where
did
they
a
come
fra
and
where
are
they
a
gan
it
awfu
like
a
sin
to
kill
them
to
this
some
smug
practical
old
sinner
would
remark
aye
it
a
peety
as
ye
say
to
kill
the
bonnie
things
but
they
were
made
to
be
killed
and
sent
for
us
to
eat
as
the
quails
were
sent
to
chosen
people
the
israelites
when
they
were
starving
in
the
desert
ayont
the
red
sea
and
i
must
confess
that
meat
was
never
put
up
in
neater
packages
in
the
new
england
and
canada
woods
beechnuts
were
their
best
and
most
abundant
food
farther
north
cranberries
and
huckleberries
after
everything
was
cleaned
up
in
the
north
and
winter
was
coming
on
they
went
south
for
rice
corn
acorns
haws
wild
grapes
etc
they
seemed
to
require
more
than
half
of
the
continent
for
moving
from
one
table
to
another
field
to
field
forest
to
forest
finding
something
ripe
and
wholesome
all
the
year
round
in
going
south
in
the
fine
weather
they
flew
high
and
followed
one
another
though
the
head
of
the
flock
might
be
hundreds
of
miles
in
advance
but
against
head
winds
they
took
advantage
of
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
flying
comparatively
low
all
followed
the
leader
ups
and
downs
over
hill
and
dale
though
far
out
of
sight
never
hesitating
at
any
turn
of
the
way
vertical
or
horizontal
that
the
leaders
had
taken
though
the
largest
flocks
stretched
across
several
states
and
belts
of
different
kinds
of
weather
there
were
no
near
our
farm
and
i
never
saw
any
of
them
until
long
after
the
great
flocks
were
exterminated
i
therefore
quote
from
audubon
and
pokagon
vivid
descriptions
toward
evening
audubon
says
they
depart
for
the
which
may
be
hundreds
of
miles
distant
one
on
the
banks
of
green
river
kentucky
was
over
three
miles
wide
and
forty
long
my
first
view
of
it
says
the
great
naturalist
was
about
a
fortnight
after
it
had
been
chosen
by
the
birds
and
i
arrived
there
nearly
two
hours
before
sunset
few
pigeons
were
then
to
be
seen
but
a
great
many
persons
with
horses
and
wagons
and
armed
with
guns
long
poles
sulphur
pots
pine
pitch
torches
had
already
established
encampments
on
the
borders
two
farmers
had
driven
upwards
of
three
hundred
hogs
a
distance
of
more
than
a
hundred
miles
to
be
fattened
on
slaughtered
pigeons
here
and
there
the
people
employed
in
plucking
and
salting
what
had
already
been
secured
were
sitting
in
the
midst
of
piles
of
birds
dung
several
inches
thick
covered
the
ground
many
trees
two
feet
in
diameter
were
broken
off
at
no
great
distance
from
the
ground
and
the
branches
of
many
of
the
tallest
and
largest
had
given
way
as
if
the
forest
had
been
swept
by
a
tornado
not
a
pigeon
had
arrived
at
sundown
suddenly
a
general
cry
arose
they
come
the
noise
they
made
though
still
distant
reminded
me
of
a
hard
gale
at
sea
passing
through
the
rigging
of
a
ship
thousands
were
soon
knocked
down
by
the
the
birds
continued
to
pour
in
the
fires
were
lighted
and
a
magnificent
as
well
as
terrifying
sight
presented
itself
the
pigeons
pouring
in
alighted
everywhere
one
above
another
until
solid
masses
were
formed
on
the
branches
all
around
here
and
there
the
perches
gave
way
with
a
crash
and
falling
destroyed
hundreds
beneath
forcing
down
the
dense
groups
with
which
every
stick
was
loaded
a
scene
of
uproar
and
conflict
i
found
it
useless
to
speak
or
even
to
shout
to
those
persons
nearest
me
even
the
reports
of
the
guns
were
seldom
heard
and
i
was
made
aware
of
the
firing
only
by
seeing
the
shooters
reloading
none
dared
venture
within
the
line
of
devastation
the
hogs
had
been
penned
up
in
due
time
the
picking
up
of
the
dead
and
wounded
being
left
for
the
next
morning
employment
the
pigeons
were
constantly
coming
in
and
it
was
after
midnight
before
i
perceived
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
those
that
arrived
the
uproar
continued
all
night
and
anxious
to
know
how
far
the
sound
reached
i
sent
off
a
man
who
returning
two
hours
after
informed
me
that
he
had
heard
it
distinctly
three
miles
distant
illustration
barometer
invented
by
the
author
in
his
boyhood
toward
daylight
the
noise
in
some
measure
subsided
long
before
objects
were
distinguishable
the
pigeons
began
to
move
off
in
a
direction
quite
different
from
that
in
which
they
had
arrived
the
evening
before
and
at
sunrise
all
that
were
able
to
fly
had
disappeared
the
howling
of
the
wolves
now
reached
our
ears
and
the
foxes
lynxes
cougars
bears
coons
opossums
and
polecats
were
seen
sneaking
off
while
eagles
and
hawks
of
different
species
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
vultures
came
to
supplant
them
and
enjoy
a
share
of
the
spoil
then
the
authors
of
all
this
devastation
began
their
entry
amongst
the
dead
the
dying
and
mangled
the
pigeons
were
picked
up
and
piled
in
heaps
until
each
had
as
many
as
they
could
possible
dispose
of
when
the
hogs
were
let
loose
to
feed
on
the
remainder
the
are
selected
with
reference
to
abundance
of
food
and
countless
myriads
resort
to
them
at
this
period
the
note
of
the
pigeon
is
coo
coo
coo
like
that
of
the
domestic
species
but
much
shorter
they
caress
by
billing
and
during
incubation
the
male
supplies
the
female
with
food
as
the
young
grow
the
tyrant
of
creation
appears
to
disturb
the
peaceful
scene
armed
with
axes
to
chop
down
the
trees
and
the
abomination
of
desolation
and
destruction
produced
far
surpasses
even
that
of
the
roosting
places
pokagon
an
educated
indian
writer
says
i
saw
one
in
wisconsin
one
hundred
miles
long
and
from
three
to
ten
miles
wide
every
tree
some
of
them
quite
low
and
scrubby
had
from
one
to
fifty
nests
on
each
some
of
the
nests
overflow
from
the
oaks
to

a
burglarious
shrike
in
the
older
eastern
states
it
used
to
be
considered
great
sport
for
an
army
of
boys
to
assemble
to
hunt
birds
squirrels
and
every
other
unclaimed
unprotected
live
thing
of
shootable
size
they
divided
into
two
squads
and
choosing
leaders
scattered
through
the
woods
in
different
directions
and
the
party
that
killed
the
greatest
number
enjoyed
a
supper
at
the
expense
of
the
other
the
whole
neighborhood
seemed
to
enjoy
the
shameful
sport
especially
the
farmers
afraid
of
their
crops
with
a
great
air
of
importance
laws
were
enacted
to
govern
the
gory
business
for
example
a
gray
squirrel
must
count
four
heads
a
woodchuck
six
heads
common
red
squirrel
two
heads
black
squirrel
ten
heads
a
partridge
five
heads
the
larger
birds
such
as
and
nighthawks
two
heads
each
the
wary
crows
three
and
three
but
all
the
blessed
company
of
mere
songbirds
warblers
robins
thrushes
orioles
with
nuthatches
chickadees
blue
jays
woodpeckers
counted
only
one
head
each
the
heads
of
the
birds
were
hastily
wrung
off
and
thrust
into
the
to
be
counted
saving
the
bodies
only
of
what
were
called
game
the
larger
squirrels
partridges
etc
the
bags
of
the
best
slayers
were
soon
bulging
full
then
at
a
given
hour
all
had
to
stop
and
repair
to
the
town
empty
their
dripping
sacks
count
the
heads
and
go
rejoicing
to
their
dinner
although
like
other
wild
boys
i
was
fond
of
shooting
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
these
abominable
and
now
the
farmers
having
learned
that
birds
are
their
friends
wholesale
slaughter
has
been
abolished
we
seldom
saw
deer
though
their
tracks
were
common
the
yankee
explained
that
they
traveled
and
fed
mostly
at
night
and
hid
in
tamarack
swamps
and
brushy
places
in
the
daytime
and
how
the
indians
knew
all
about
them
and
could
find
them
whenever
they
were
hungry
indians
belonging
to
the
menominee
and
winnebago
tribes
occasionally
visited
us
at
our
cabin
to
get
a
piece
of
bread
or
some
matches
or
to
sharpen
their
knives
on
our
grindstone
and
we
boys
watched
them
closely
to
see
that
they
did
steal
jack
we
wondered
at
their
knowledge
of
animals
when
we
saw
them
go
direct
to
trees
on
our
farm
chop
holes
in
them
with
their
tomahawks
and
take
out
coons
of
the
existence
of
which
we
had
never
noticed
the
slightest
trace
in
winter
after
the
first
snow
we
frequently
saw
three
or
four
indians
hunting
deer
in
company
running
like
hounds
on
the
fresh
exciting
tracks
the
escape
of
the
deer
from
these
noiseless
tireless
hunters
was
said
to
be
impossible
they
were
followed
to
the
death
most
of
our
neighbors
brought
some
sort
of
gun
from
the
old
country
but
seldom
took
time
to
hunt
even
after
the
first
hard
work
of
fencing
and
clearing
was
over
except
to
shoot
a
duck
or
prairie
chicken
now
and
then
that
happened
to
come
in
their
way
it
was
only
the
less
industrious
american
settlers
who
left
their
work
to
go
far
two
or
three
of
our
most
enterprising
american
neighbors
went
off
every
fall
with
their
teams
to
the
pine
regions
and
cranberry
marshes
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
to
hunt
and
gather
berries
i
well
remember
seeing
their
wagons
loaded
with
game
when
they
returned
from
a
successful
hunt
their
loads
consisted
usually
of
half
a
dozen
deer
or
more
one
or
two
black
bears
and
fifteen
or
twenty
bushels
of
cranberries
all
solidly
frozen
part
of
both
the
berries
and
meat
was
usually
sold
in
portage
the
balance
furnished
their
families
with
abundance
of
venison
bear
grease
and
pies
winter
wheat
is
sown
in
the
fall
and
when
it
is
a
month
or
so
old
the
deer
like
the
wild
geese
are
very
fond
of
it
especially
since
other
kinds
of
food
are
then
becoming
scarce
one
of
our
neighbors
across
the
fox
river
killed
a
large
number
some
thirty
or
forty
on
a
small
patch
of
wheat
simply
by
lying
in
wait
for
them
every
night
our
was
the
first
that
was
sown
in
the
neighborhood
the
deer
soon
found
it
and
came
in
every
night
to
feast
but
it
was
eight
or
nine
years
before
we
ever
disturbed
them
david
then
killed
one
deer
the
only
one
killed
by
any
of
our
family
he
went
out
shortly
after
sundown
at
the
time
of
full
moon
to
one
of
our
carrying
a
shotgun
loaded
with
buckshot
after
lying
in
wait
an
hour
or
so
he
saw
a
doe
and
her
fawn
jump
the
fence
and
come
cautiously
into
the
wheat
after
they
were
within
sixty
or
seventy
yards
of
him
he
was
surprised
when
he
tried
to
take
aim
that
about
half
of
the
moon
disc
was
mysteriously
darkened
as
if
covered
by
the
edge
of
a
dense
cloud
this
proved
to
be
an
eclipse
nevertheless
he
fired
at
the
mother
and
she
immediately
ran
off
jumped
the
fence
and
took
to
the
woods
by
the
way
she
came
the
fawn
danced
about
bewildered
wondering
what
had
become
of
its
mother
but
finally
fled
to
the
woods
david
fired
at
the
poor
deserted
thing
as
it
ran
past
him
but
happily
missed
it
hearing
the
shots
i
joined
david
to
learn
his
luck
he
said
he
thought
he
must
have
wounded
the
mother
and
when
we
were
strolling
about
in
the
woods
in
search
of
her
we
saw
three
or
four
deer
on
their
way
to
the
led
by
a
fine
buck
they
were
walking
rapidly
but
cautiously
halted
at
intervals
of
a
few
rods
to
listen
and
look
ahead
and
scent
the
air
they
failed
to
notice
us
though
by
this
time
the
moon
was
out
of
the
eclipse
shadow
and
we
were
standing
only
about
fifty
yards
from
them
i
was
carrying
the
gun
david
had
fired
both
barrels
but
when
he
was
reloading
one
of
them
he
happened
to
put
the
wad
intended
to
cover
the
shot
into
the
empty
barrel
and
so
when
we
were
climbing
over
the
fence
the
buckshot
had
rolled
out
and
when
i
fired
at
the
big
buck
i
knew
by
the
report
that
there
was
nothing
but
powder
in
the
charge
the
startled
deer
danced
about
in
confusion
for
a
few
seconds
uncertain
which
way
to
run
until
they
caught
sight
of
us
when
they
bounded
off
through
the
woods
next
morning
we
found
the
poor
mother
lying
about
three
hundred
yards
from
the
place
where
she
was
shot
she
had
run
this
distance
and
jumped
a
high
fence
after
one
of
the
buckshot
had
passed
through
her
heart
excepting
sundays
we
boys
had
only
two
days
of
the
year
to
ourselves
the
of
july
and
the
of
january
sundays
were
less
than
half
our
own
on
account
of
bible
lessons
lessons
and
church
services
all
the
others
were
labor
days
rain
or
shine
cold
or
warm
no
wonder
then
that
our
two
holidays
were
precious
and
that
it
was
not
easy
to
decide
what
to
do
with
them
they
were
usually
spent
on
the
highest
rocky
hill
in
the
neighborhood
called
the
observatory
in
visiting
our
boy
friends
on
adjacent
farms
to
hunt
fish
wrestle
and
play
games
in
reading
some
new
favorite
book
we
had
managed
to
borrow
or
buy
or
in
making
models
of
machines
i
had
invented
one
of
our
july
days
was
spent
with
two
scotch
boys
of
our
own
age
hunting
redwing
blackbirds
then
busy
in
the
our
party
had
only
one
shotgun
which
as
the
oldest
and
perhaps
because
i
was
thought
to
be
the
best
shot
i
had
the
honor
of
carrying
we
marched
through
the
corn
without
getting
sight
of
a
single
redwing
but
just
as
we
reached
the
far
side
of
the
field
a
woodpecker
flew
up
and
the
lawson
boys
cried
shoot
him
shoot
him
he
is
just
as
bad
as
a
blackbird
he
eats
corn
this
memorable
woodpecker
alighted
in
the
top
of
a
white
oak
tree
about
fifty
feet
high
i
fired
from
a
position
almost
immediately
beneath
him
and
he
fell
straight
down
at
my
feet
when
i
picked
him
up
and
was
admiring
his
plumage
he
moved
his
legs
slightly
and
i
said
poor
bird
he
no
deed
yet
and
we
hae
to
kill
him
to
put
him
oot
o
pain
sincerely
pitying
him
after
we
had
taken
pleasure
in
shooting
him
i
had
seen
servant
girls
wringing
chicken
necks
so
with
desperate
humanity
i
took
the
limp
unfortunate
by
the
head
swung
him
around
three
or
four
times
thinking
i
was
wringing
his
neck
and
then
threw
him
hard
on
the
ground
to
quench
the
last
possible
spark
of
life
and
make
quick
death
doubly
sure
but
to
our
astonishment
the
moment
he
struck
the
ground
he
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
and
flew
right
straight
up
like
a
rejoicing
lark
into
the
top
of
the
same
tree
and
perhaps
to
the
same
branch
he
had
fallen
from
and
began
to
adjust
his
ruffled
feathers
nodding
and
chirping
and
looking
down
at
us
as
if
wondering
what
in
the
bird
world
we
had
been
doing
to
him
this
of
course
banished
all
thought
of
killing
as
far
as
that
revived
woodpecker
was
concerned
no
matter
how
many
ears
of
corn
he
might
spoil
and
we
all
heartily
congratulated
him
on
his
wonderful
triumphant
resurrection
from
three
kinds
of
death
shooting
and
destructive
concussion
i
suppose
only
one
pellet
had
touched
him
glancing
on
his
head
another
extraordinary
happened
one
summer
morning
shortly
after
daybreak
when
i
went
to
the
stable
to
feed
the
horses
i
noticed
a
big
hawk
on
a
tall
oak
in
front
of
the
evidently
waiting
for
a
chicken
breakfast
i
ran
to
the
house
for
the
gun
and
when
i
fired
he
fell
about
halfway
down
the
tree
caught
a
branch
with
his
claws
hung
back
downward
and
fluttered
a
few
seconds
then
managed
to
stand
erect
i
fired
again
to
put
him
out
of
pain
and
to
my
surprise
the
second
shot
seemed
to
restore
his
strength
instead
of
killing
him
for
he
flew
out
of
the
tree
and
over
the
meadow
with
strong
and
regular
for
thirty
or
forty
rods
apparently
as
well
as
ever
but
died
suddenly
in
the
air
and
dropped
like
a
stone
we
hunted
muskrats
whenever
we
had
time
to
run
down
to
the
lake
they
are
brown
bunchy
animals
about
inches
long
the
tail
being
about
nine
inches
in
length
black
in
color
and
flattened
vertically
for
sculling
and
the
hind
feet
are
they
look
like
little
beavers
usually
have
from
ten
to
a
dozen
young
are
easily
tamed
and
make
interesting
pets
we
liked
to
watch
them
at
their
work
and
at
their
meals
in
the
spring
when
the
snow
vanishes
and
the
lake
ice
begins
to
melt
the
first
open
spot
is
always
used
as
a
where
they
dive
from
the
edge
of
the
ice
and
in
a
minute
or
less
reappear
with
a
mussel
or
a
mouthful
of
pontederia
or
leaves
climb
back
on
to
the
ice
and
sit
up
to
nibble
their
food
handling
it
very
much
like
squirrels
or
marmots
it
is
then
that
they
are
most
easily
shot
a
solitary
hunter
oftentimes
shooting
thirty
or
forty
in
a
single
day
their
nests
on
the
rushy
margins
of
lakes
and
streams
far
from
being
hidden
like
those
of
most
birds
are
conspicuously
large
and
conical
in
shape
like
indian
wigwams
they
are
built
of
plants
rushes
sedges
mosses
and
ornamented
around
the
base
with
it
was
always
pleasant
and
interesting
to
see
them
in
the
fall
as
soon
as
the
nights
began
to
be
frosty
hard
at
work
cutting
sedges
on
the
edge
of
the
meadow
or
swimming
out
through
the
rushes
making
long
glittering
ripples
as
they
sculled
themselves
along
diving
where
the
water
is
perhaps
six
or
eight
feet
deep
and
reappearing
in
a
minute
or
so
with
large
mouthfuls
of
the
weedy
tangled
plants
gathered
from
the
bottom
returning
to
their
big
wigwams
climbing
up
and
depositing
their
loads
where
most
needed
to
make
them
yet
larger
and
firmer
and
warmer
foreseeing
the
freezing
weather
just
like
ourselves
when
we
banked
up
our
house
to
keep
out
the
frost
they
lie
snug
and
invisible
all
winter
but
do
not
hibernate
through
a
channel
carefully
kept
open
they
swim
out
under
the
ice
for
mussels
and
the
roots
and
stems
of
on
which
they
feed
just
as
they
do
in
summer
sometimes
the
oldest
and
most
enterprising
of
them
venture
to
orchards
near
the
water
in
search
of
fallen
apples
very
seldom
however
do
they
interfere
with
anything
belonging
to
their
mortal
enemy
man
notwithstanding
they
are
so
well
hidden
and
protected
during
the
winter
many
of
them
are
killed
by
indian
hunters
who
creep
up
softly
and
spear
them
through
the
thick
walls
of
their
cabins
indians
are
fond
of
their
flesh
and
so
are
some
of
the
wildest
of
the
white
trappers
they
are
easily
caught
in
steel
traps
and
after
vainly
trying
to
drag
their
feet
from
the
cruel
crushing
jaws
they
sometimes
in
their
agony
gnaw
them
off
even
after
having
gnawed
off
a
leg
they
are
so
guileless
that
they
never
seem
to
learn
to
know
and
fear
traps
for
some
are
occasionally
found
that
have
been
caught
twice
and
have
gnawed
off
a
second
foot
many
other
animals
suffering
excruciating
pain
in
these
cruel
traps
gnaw
off
their
legs
crabs
and
lobsters
are
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
shed
their
limbs
when
caught
or
merely
frightened
apparently
without
suffering
any
pain
simply
by
giving
themselves
a
little
shivery
shake
the
muskrat
is
one
of
the
most
notable
and
widely
distributed
of
american
animals
and
millions
of
the
gentle
industrious
creatures
are
shot
and
trapped
and
speared
every
season
for
their
skins
worth
a
dime
or
so
like
shooting
boys
and
girls
for
their
garments
surely
a
better
time
must
be
drawing
nigh
when
godlike
human
beings
will
become
truly
humane
and
learn
to
put
their
animal
fellow
mortals
in
their
hearts
instead
of
on
their
backs
or
in
their
dinners
in
the
mean
time
we
may
just
as
well
as
not
learn
to
live
clean
innocent
lives
instead
of
slimy
bloody
ones
all
hale
boys
are
savage
the
best
and
boldest
the
savagest
fond
of
hunting
and
fishing
but
when
thoughtless
childhood
is
past
the
best
rise
the
highest
above
all
this
bloody
flesh
and
sport
business
the
wild
foundational
animal
dying
out
day
by
day
as
divine
uplifting
transfiguring
charity
grows
in
hares
and
rabbits
were
seldom
seen
when
we
first
settled
in
the
wisconsin
woods
but
they
multiplied
rapidly
after
the
animals
that
preyed
upon
them
had
been
thinned
out
or
exterminated
and
food
and
shelter
supplied
in
and
log
fences
and
the
thickets
of
young
oaks
that
grew
up
in
pastures
after
the
annual
grass
fires
were
kept
out
catching
hares
in
the
when
they
were
hidden
in
hollow
was
a
favorite
pastime
with
many
of
the
boys
whose
fathers
allowed
them
time
to
enjoy
the
sport
occasionally
a
stout
lithe
hare
was
carried
out
into
an
open
field
set
free
and
given
a
chance
for
its
life
in
a
race
with
a
dog
when
the
snow
was
not
too
soft
and
deep
it
usually
made
good
its
escape
for
our
dogs
were
only
fat
mongrels
we
sometimes
discovered
hares
in
standing
hollow
trees
crouching
on
decayed
punky
wood
at
the
bottom
as
far
back
as
possible
from
the
opening
but
when
alarmed
they
managed
to
climb
to
a
considerable
height
if
the
hollow
was
not
too
wide
by
bracing
themselves
against
the
sides
foxes
though
not
uncommon
we
boys
held
steadily
to
work
seldom
saw
and
as
they
found
plenty
of
prairie
chickens
for
themselves
and
families
they
did
not
often
come
near
the
farmer
nevertheless
the
discovery
of
their
dens
was
considered
important
no
matter
how
deep
the
den
might
be
it
was
thoroughly
explored
with
pick
and
shovel
by
settlers
at
a
time
when
they
judged
the
fox
was
likely
to
be
at
home
but
i
can
not
remember
any
case
in
our
neighborhood
where
the
fox
was
actually
captured
in
one
of
the
dens
a
mile
or
two
from
our
farm
a
lot
of
prairie
chickens
were
found
and
some
smaller
birds
badger
dens
were
far
more
common
than
fox
dens
one
of
our
fields
was
named
badger
hill
from
the
number
of
badger
holes
in
a
hill
at
the
end
of
it
but
i
can
not
remember
seeing
a
single
one
of
the
inhabitants
on
a
stormy
day
in
the
middle
of
an
unusually
severe
winter
a
black
bear
hungry
no
doubt
and
seeking
something
to
eat
came
strolling
down
through
our
neighborhood
from
the
northern
pine
woods
none
had
been
seen
here
before
and
it
caused
no
little
excitement
and
alarm
for
the
european
settlers
imagined
that
these
poor
timid
bashful
bears
were
as
dangerous
as
lions
and
tigers
and
that
they
would
pursue
any
human
being
that
came
in
their
way
this
species
is
common
in
the
north
part
of
the
state
and
few
of
our
enterprising
yankee
hunters
who
went
to
the
pineries
in
the
fall
failed
to
shoot
at
least
one
of
them
we
saw
very
little
of
the
owlish
coons
and
no
wonder
since
they
lie
hidden
nearly
all
day
in
hollow
trees
and
we
never
had
time
to
hunt
them
we
often
heard
their
curious
quavering
whinnying
cries
on
still
evenings
but
only
once
succeeded
in
tracing
an
unfortunate
family
through
our
to
their
den
in
a
big
oak
and
catching
them
all
one
of
our
neighbors
mcrath
a
highland
scotchman
caught
one
and
made
a
pet
of
it
it
became
very
tame
and
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
good
intentions
of
its
kind
friend
and
master
he
always
addressed
it
in
speaking
to
it
as
a
little
man
when
it
came
running
to
him
and
jumped
on
his
lap
or
climbed
up
his
trousers
he
would
say
while
patting
its
head
as
if
it
were
a
dog
or
a
child
coonie
ma
mannie
coonie
ma
mannie
hoo
are
ye
the
day
i
think
you
hungry
as
the
comical
pet
began
to
examine
his
pockets
for
nuts
and
bits
of
bread
na
na
there
nathing
in
my
pooch
for
ye
the
day
my
wee
mannie
but
i
get
ye
something
he
would
then
fetch
something
it
liked
bread
nuts
a
carrot
or
perhaps
a
piece
of
fresh
meat
anything
scattered
for
it
on
the
floor
it
felt
with
its
paw
instead
of
looking
at
it
judging
of
its
worth
more
by
touch
than
sight
the
outlet
of
our
fountain
lake
flowed
past
mcrath
door
and
the
coon
was
very
fond
of
swimming
in
it
and
searching
for
frogs
and
mussels
it
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
to
stay
about
the
house
without
being
confined
occupied
a
comfortable
bed
in
a
section
of
a
hollow
tree
and
never
wandered
far
how
long
it
lived
after
the
death
of
its
kind
master
i
do
know
i
suppose
that
almost
any
wild
animal
may
be
made
a
pet
simply
by
sympathizing
with
it
and
entering
as
much
as
possible
into
its
life
in
alaska
i
saw
one
of
the
common
gray
mountain
marmots
kept
as
a
pet
in
an
indian
family
when
its
master
entered
the
house
it
always
seemed
glad
almost
like
a
dog
and
when
cold
or
tired
it
snuggled
up
in
a
fold
of
his
blanket
with
the
utmost
confidence
we
have
all
heard
of
ferocious
animals
lions
and
tigers
that
were
fed
and
spoken
to
only
by
their
masters
becoming
perfectly
tame
and
as
is
well
known
the
faithful
dog
that
follows
man
and
serves
him
and
looks
up
to
him
and
loves
him
as
if
he
were
a
god
is
a
descendant
of
the
wolf
or
jackal
even
frogs
and
toads
and
fishes
may
be
tamed
provided
they
have
the
uniform
sympathy
of
one
person
with
whom
they
become
intimately
acquainted
without
the
distracting
and
varying
attentions
of
strangers
and
surely
all
people
however
serious
and
savage
great
or
small
like
to
play
whales
and
elephants
dancing
humming
gnats
and
invisibly
small
mischievous
microbes
all
are
warm
with
divine
radium
and
must
have
lots
of
fun
in
them
as
far
as
i
know
all
wild
creatures
keep
themselves
clean
birds
it
seems
to
me
take
more
pains
to
bathe
and
dress
themselves
than
any
other
animals
even
ducks
though
living
so
much
in
water
dip
and
scatter
cleansing
showers
over
their
backs
and
shake
and
preen
their
feathers
as
carefully
as
watching
small
singers
taking
their
morning
baths
is
very
interesting
particularly
when
the
weather
is
cold
alighting
in
a
shallow
pool
they
oftentimes
show
a
sort
of
dread
of
dipping
into
it
like
children
hesitating
about
taking
a
plunge
as
if
they
felt
the
same
kind
of
shock
and
this
makes
it
easy
for
us
to
sympathize
with
the
little
feathered
people
occasionally
i
have
seen
from
my
linnets
bathing
in
dew
when
water
elsewhere
was
scarce
a
large
monterey
cypress
with
broad
branches
and
innumerable
leaves
on
which
the
dew
lodges
in
still
nights
made
favorite
alighting
gently
as
if
afraid
to
waste
the
dew
they
would
pause
and
fidget
as
they
do
before
beginning
to
plash
in
pools
then
dip
and
scatter
the
drops
in
showers
and
get
as
thorough
a
bath
as
they
would
in
a
pool
i
have
also
seen
the
same
kind
of
baths
taken
by
birds
on
the
boughs
of
silver
firs
on
the
edge
of
a
glacier
meadow
but
nowhere
have
i
seen
the
dewdrops
so
abundant
as
on
the
monterey
cypress
and
the
picture
made
by
the
quivering
wings
and
irised
dew
was
memorably
beautiful
children
too
make
fine
pictures
plashing
and
crowing
in
their
little
tubs
how
widely
different
from
wallowing
pigs
bathing
with
great
show
of
comfort
and
rubbing
themselves
dry
against
trees
some
of
our
own
species
seem
fairly
to
dread
the
touch
of
water
when
the
necessity
of
absolute
cleanliness
by
means
of
frequent
baths
was
being
preached
by
a
friend
who
had
been
reading
combe
physiology
in
which
he
had
learned
something
of
the
wonders
of
the
skin
with
its
millions
of
pores
that
had
to
be
kept
open
for
health
one
of
our
neighbors
remarked
oh
that
unnatural
it
well
enough
to
wash
in
a
tub
maybe
once
or
twice
a
year
but
not
to
be
paddling
in
the
water
all
the
time
like
a
frog
in
a
another
neighbor
who
prided
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
big
words
said
with
great
solemnity
i
never
can
believe
that
man
is
amphibious
natives
of
tropic
islands
pass
a
large
part
of
their
lives
in
water
and
seem
as
much
at
home
in
the
sea
as
on
the
land
swim
and
dive
pursue
fishes
play
in
the
waves
like
and
seals
and
explore
the
coral
gardens
and
groves
and
seaweed
meadows
as
if
truly
amphibious
even
the
natives
of
the
far
north
bathe
at
times
i
once
saw
a
lot
of
eskimo
boys
ducking
and
plashing
right
merrily
in
the
arctic
ocean
it
seemed
very
wonderful
to
us
that
the
wild
animals
could
keep
themselves
warm
and
strong
in
winter
when
the
temperature
was
far
below
zero
rabbits
scud
away
over
the
snow
lithe
and
elastic
as
if
glorying
in
the
frosty
sparkling
weather
and
sure
of
their
dinners
i
have
seen
gray
squirrels
dragging
ears
of
corn
about
as
heavy
as
themselves
out
of
our
field
through
loose
snow
and
up
a
tree
balancing
them
on
limbs
and
eating
in
comfort
with
their
dry
electric
tails
spread
airily
over
their
backs
once
i
saw
a
fine
hardy
fellow
go
into
a
thrusting
in
my
hand
i
caught
him
and
pulled
him
out
as
soon
as
he
guessed
what
i
was
up
to
he
took
the
end
of
my
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
sunk
his
teeth
right
through
it
but
i
gripped
him
hard
by
the
neck
carried
him
home
and
shut
him
up
in
a
box
that
contained
about
half
a
bushel
of
hoping
that
he
would
not
be
too
much
frightened
and
discouraged
to
eat
while
thus
imprisoned
after
the
rough
handling
he
had
suffered
i
soon
learned
however
that
sympathy
in
this
direction
was
wasted
for
no
sooner
did
i
pop
him
in
than
he
fell
to
with
right
hearty
appetite
gnawing
and
munching
the
nuts
as
if
he
had
gathered
them
himself
and
was
very
hungry
that
day
therefore
after
allowing
time
enough
for
a
good
square
meal
i
made
haste
to
get
him
out
of
the
and
shut
him
up
in
a
spare
bedroom
in
which
father
had
hung
a
lot
of
selected
ears
of
indian
corn
for
seed
they
were
hung
up
by
the
husks
on
cords
stretched
across
from
side
to
side
of
the
room
the
squirrel
managed
to
jump
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
to
the
cord
cut
off
an
ear
and
let
it
drop
to
the
floor
he
then
jumped
down
got
a
good
grip
of
the
heavy
ear
carried
it
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
slippery
polished
seated
himself
comfortably
and
holding
it
well
balanced
deliberately
pried
out
one
kernel
at
a
time
with
his
long
chisel
teeth
ate
the
soft
sweet
germ
and
dropped
the
hard
part
of
the
kernel
in
this
masterly
way
working
at
high
speed
he
demolished
several
ears
a
day
and
with
a
good
warm
bed
in
a
box
made
himself
at
home
and
grew
fat
then
naturally
i
suppose
free
romping
in
the
snow
and
with
companions
came
to
mind
anyhow
he
began
to
look
for
a
way
of
escape
of
course
he
first
tried
the
window
but
found
that
his
teeth
made
no
impression
on
the
glass
next
he
tried
the
sash
and
gnawed
the
wood
off
level
with
the
glass
then
father
happened
to
come
upstairs
and
discovered
the
mischief
that
was
being
done
to
his
seed
corn
and
window
and
immediately
ordered
him
out
of
the
house
the
flying
squirrel
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
the
little
animals
we
found
in
the
woods
a
beautiful
brown
creature
with
fine
eyes
and
smooth
soft
fur
like
that
of
a
mole
or
field
mouse
he
is
about
half
as
long
as
the
gray
squirrel
but
his
tail
and
the
folds
of
skin
along
his
sides
that
form
the
wings
make
him
look
broad
and
flat
something
like
a
kite
in
the
evenings
our
cat
often
brought
them
to
her
kittens
at
the
shanty
and
later
we
saw
them
fly
during
the
day
from
the
trees
we
were
chopping
they
jumped
and
glided
off
smoothly
and
apparently
without
effort
like
birds
as
soon
as
they
heard
and
felt
the
breaking
shock
of
the
strained
fibres
at
the
stump
when
the
trees
they
were
in
began
to
totter
and
groan
they
can
fly
or
rather
glide
twenty
or
thirty
yards
from
the
top
of
a
tree
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
to
the
foot
of
another
gliding
upward
as
they
reach
the
trunk
or
if
the
distance
is
too
great
they
alight
comfortably
on
the
ground
and
make
haste
to
the
nearest
tree
and
climb
just
like
the
wingless
squirrels
every
boy
and
girl
loves
the
little
fairy
airy
striped
chipmunk
half
squirrel
half
spermophile
he
is
about
the
size
of
a
field
mouse
and
often
made
us
think
of
linnets
and
song
sparrows
as
he
frisked
about
gathering
nuts
and
berries
he
likes
almost
all
kinds
of
grain
berries
and
nuts
strawberries
huckleberries
wheat
oats
corn
he
is
fond
of
them
all
and
thrives
on
them
most
of
the
hazel
bushes
on
our
farm
grew
along
the
fences
as
if
they
had
been
planted
for
the
chipmunks
alone
for
the
rail
fences
were
their
favorite
highways
we
never
wearied
watching
them
especially
when
the
were
ripe
and
the
little
fellows
were
sitting
on
the
rails
nibbling
and
handling
them
like
we
used
to
notice
too
that
although
they
are
very
neat
animals
their
lips
and
fingers
were
dyed
red
like
our
own
when
the
strawberries
and
huckleberries
were
ripe
we
could
always
tell
when
the
wheat
and
oats
were
in
the
milk
by
seeing
the
chipmunks
feeding
on
the
ears
they
kept
nibbling
at
the
wheat
until
it
was
harvested
and
then
gleaned
in
the
stubble
keeping
up
a
careful
watch
for
their
enemies
dogs
hawks
and
shrikes
they
are
as
widely
distributed
over
the
continent
as
the
squirrels
various
species
inhabiting
different
regions
on
the
mountains
and
lowlands
but
all
the
different
kinds
have
the
same
general
characteristics
of
light
airy
cheerfulness
and
good
nature
before
the
arrival
of
farmers
in
the
wisconsin
woods
the
small
ground
squirrels
called
gophers
lived
chiefly
on
the
seeds
of
wild
grasses
and
weeds
but
after
the
country
was
cleared
and
ploughed
no
feasting
animal
fell
to
more
heartily
on
the
farmer
wheat
and
corn
increasing
rapidly
in
numbers
and
knowledge
they
became
very
destructive
especially
in
the
spring
when
the
corn
was
planted
for
they
learned
to
trace
the
rows
and
dig
up
and
eat
the
three
or
four
seeds
in
each
hill
about
as
fast
as
the
poor
farmers
could
cover
them
and
unless
great
pains
were
taken
to
diminish
the
numbers
of
the
cunning
little
robbers
the
fields
had
to
be
planted
two
or
three
times
over
and
even
then
large
gaps
in
the
rows
would
be
found
the
loss
of
the
grain
they
consumed
after
it
was
ripe
together
with
the
winter
stores
laid
up
in
their
burrows
amounted
to
little
as
compared
with
the
loss
of
the
seed
on
which
the
whole
crop
depended
one
evening
about
sundown
when
my
father
sent
me
out
with
the
shotgun
to
hunt
them
in
a
stubble
field
i
learned
something
curious
and
interesting
in
connection
with
these
mischievous
gophers
though
just
then
they
were
doing
no
harm
as
i
strolled
through
the
stubble
watching
for
a
chance
for
a
shot
a
shrike
flew
past
me
and
alighted
on
an
open
spot
at
the
mouth
of
a
burrow
about
thirty
yards
ahead
of
me
curious
to
see
what
he
was
up
to
i
stood
still
to
watch
him
he
looked
down
the
gopher
hole
in
a
listening
attitude
then
looked
back
at
me
to
see
if
i
was
coming
looked
down
again
and
listened
and
looked
back
at
me
i
stood
perfectly
still
and
he
kept
twitching
his
tail
seeming
uneasy
and
doubtful
about
venturing
to
do
the
savage
job
that
i
soon
learned
he
had
in
his
mind
finally
encouraged
by
my
keeping
so
still
to
my
astonishment
he
suddenly
vanished
in
the
gopher
hole
illustration
combined
thermometer
hygrometer
barometer
and
pyrometer
invented
by
the
author
in
his
boyhood
a
bird
going
down
a
deep
narrow
hole
in
the
ground
like
a
ferret
or
a
weasel
seemed
very
strange
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
run
forward
clap
my
hand
over
the
hole
and
have
the
fun
of
imprisoning
him
and
seeing
what
he
would
do
when
he
tried
to
get
out
so
i
ran
forward
but
stopped
when
i
got
within
a
dozen
or
fifteen
yards
of
the
hole
thinking
it
might
perhaps
be
more
interesting
to
wait
and
see
what
would
naturally
happen
without
my
interference
while
i
stood
there
looking
and
listening
i
heard
a
great
disturbance
going
on
in
the
burrow
a
mixed
lot
of
keen
squeaking
shrieking
distressful
cries
telling
that
down
in
the
dark
something
terrible
was
being
done
then
suddenly
out
popped
a
gopher
four
and
a
half
or
five
inches
long
and
without
stopping
a
single
moment
to
choose
a
way
of
escape
ran
screaming
through
the
stubble
straight
away
from
its
home
quickly
followed
by
another
and
another
until
some
were
driven
out
all
of
them
crying
and
running
in
different
directions
as
if
at
this
dreadful
time
home
sweet
home
was
the
most
dangerous
and
least
desirable
of
any
place
in
the
wide
world
then
out
came
the
shrike
flew
above
the
gopher
children
and
diving
on
them
killed
them
one
after
another
with
blows
at
the
back
of
the
skull
he
then
seized
one
of
them
dragged
it
to
the
top
of
a
small
clod
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
a
start
and
laboriously
made
out
to
fly
with
it
about
ten
or
fifteen
yards
when
he
alighted
to
rest
then
he
dragged
it
to
the
top
of
another
clod
and
flew
with
it
about
the
same
distance
repeating
this
hard
work
over
and
over
again
until
he
managed
to
get
one
of
the
gophers
on
to
the
top
of
a
log
fence
how
much
he
ate
of
his
prey
or
what
he
did
with
the
others
i
ca
tell
for
by
this
time
the
sun
was
down
and
i
had
to
hurry
home
to
my
chores
vi
the
ploughboy
the
crops
doing
chores
the
sights
and
sounds
of
winter
the
craze
tuberculosis
among
the
settlers
a
cruel
brother
the
rights
of
the
indians
put
to
the
plough
at
the
age
of
twelve
in
the
among
the
settlers
running
the
digging
a
well
lining
bees
at
first
wheat
corn
and
potatoes
were
the
principal
crops
we
raised
wheat
especially
but
in
four
or
five
years
the
soil
was
so
exhausted
that
only
five
or
six
bushels
an
acre
even
in
the
better
fields
was
obtained
although
when
first
ploughed
twenty
and
bushels
was
about
the
ordinary
yield
more
attention
was
then
paid
to
corn
but
without
fertilizers
the
also
became
very
meagre
at
last
it
was
discovered
that
english
clover
would
grow
on
even
the
exhausted
fields
and
that
when
ploughed
under
and
planted
with
corn
or
even
wheat
wonderful
crops
were
raised
this
caused
a
complete
change
in
farming
methods
the
farmers
raised
fertilizing
clover
planted
corn
and
fed
the
crop
to
cattle
and
hogs
but
no
crop
raised
in
our
wilderness
was
so
surprisingly
rich
and
sweet
and
purely
generous
to
us
boys
and
indeed
to
everybody
as
the
watermelons
and
muskmelons
we
planted
a
large
patch
on
a
sunny
the
very
first
spring
and
it
seemed
miraculous
that
a
few
handfuls
of
little
flat
seeds
should
in
a
few
months
send
up
a
hundred
of
crisp
sumptuous
and
fruits
covering
all
the
hill
we
soon
learned
to
know
when
they
were
in
their
prime
and
when
and
mealy
also
that
if
a
second
crop
was
taken
from
the
same
ground
without
fertilizing
it
the
melons
would
be
small
and
what
we
called
soapy
that
is
soft
and
smooth
utterly
uncrisp
and
without
a
trace
of
the
lively
freshness
and
sweetness
of
those
raised
on
virgin
soil
coming
in
from
the
farm
work
at
noon
the
or
so
of
melons
we
had
placed
in
our
cold
spring
were
a
glorious
luxury
that
only
weary
barefooted
farm
boys
can
ever
know
spring
was
not
very
trying
as
to
temperature
and
refreshing
rains
fell
at
short
intervals
the
work
of
ploughing
commenced
as
soon
as
the
frost
was
out
of
the
ground
and
the
sowing
of
spring
wheat
was
comparatively
light
work
while
the
nesting
birds
sang
cheerily
grass
and
flowers
covered
the
marshes
and
meadows
and
all
the
wild
uncleared
parts
of
the
farm
and
the
trees
put
forth
their
new
leaves
those
of
the
oaks
forming
beautiful
purple
masses
as
if
every
leaf
were
a
petal
and
with
all
this
we
enjoyed
the
mild
soothing
winds
the
humming
of
innumerable
small
insects
and
hylas
and
the
freshness
and
fragrance
of
everything
then
too
came
the
wonderful
passenger
pigeons
streaming
from
the
south
and
flocks
of
geese
and
cranes
filling
all
the
sky
with
whistling
wings
the
summer
work
on
the
contrary
was
deadly
heavy
especially
harvesting
and
all
the
ground
had
to
be
hoed
over
for
the
first
few
years
before
father
bought
cultivators
or
small
ploughs
and
we
were
not
allowed
a
moment
rest
the
hoes
had
to
be
kept
working
up
and
down
as
steadily
as
if
they
were
moved
by
machinery
ploughing
for
winter
wheat
was
comparatively
easy
when
we
walked
barefooted
in
the
furrows
while
the
fine
autumn
tints
kindled
in
the
woods
and
the
hillsides
were
covered
with
golden
pumpkins
in
summer
the
chores
were
grinding
scythes
feeding
the
animals
chopping
and
carrying
water
up
the
hill
from
the
spring
on
the
edge
of
the
meadow
etc
then
breakfast
and
to
the
harvest
or
i
was
foolishly
ambitious
to
be
first
in
mowing
and
cradling
and
by
the
time
i
was
sixteen
led
all
the
hired
men
an
hour
was
allowed
at
noon
for
dinner
and
more
chores
we
stayed
in
the
field
until
dark
then
supper
and
still
more
chores
family
worship
and
to
bed
making
altogether
a
hard
sweaty
day
of
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
hours
think
of
that
ye
blessed
laborers
in
winter
father
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
us
at
six
to
feed
the
horses
and
cattle
grind
axes
bring
in
wood
and
do
any
other
chores
required
then
breakfast
and
out
to
work
in
the
mealy
frosty
snow
by
daybreak
chopping
fencing
etc
so
in
general
our
winter
work
was
about
as
restless
and
trying
as
that
of
the
summer
no
matter
what
the
weather
there
was
always
something
to
do
during
heavy
rains
or
snowstorms
we
worked
in
the
barn
shelling
corn
fanning
wheat
thrashing
with
the
flail
making
or
mending
things
or
sprouting
and
sorting
potatoes
in
the
cellar
no
pains
were
taken
to
diminish
or
in
any
way
soften
the
natural
hardships
of
this
pioneer
farm
life
nor
did
any
of
the
europeans
seem
to
know
how
to
find
reasonable
ease
and
comfort
if
they
would
the
very
best
oak
and
hickory
fuel
was
embarrassingly
abundant
and
cost
nothing
but
cutting
and
common
sense
but
instead
of
hauling
great
loads
of
it
for
wide
open
godlike
it
was
hauled
with
weary
industry
into
fences
and
waste
places
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
of
the
plough
and
out
of
the
way
of
doing
good
the
only
fire
for
the
whole
house
was
the
kitchen
stove
with
a
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
eight
inches
wide
and
deep
scant
space
for
three
or
four
small
sticks
around
which
in
hard
zero
weather
all
the
family
of
ten
persons
shivered
and
beneath
which
in
the
morning
we
found
our
socks
and
coarse
soggy
boots
frozen
solid
we
were
not
allowed
to
start
even
this
despicable
little
fire
in
its
black
box
to
thaw
them
no
we
had
to
squeeze
our
throbbing
aching
chilblained
feet
into
them
causing
greater
pain
than
toothache
and
hurry
out
to
chores
fortunately
the
miserable
chilblain
pain
began
to
abate
as
soon
as
the
temperature
of
our
feet
approached
the
enabling
us
in
spite
of
hard
work
and
hard
frost
to
enjoy
the
winter
beauty
the
wonderful
radiance
of
the
snow
when
it
was
starry
with
crystals
and
the
dawns
and
the
sunsets
and
white
noons
and
the
cheery
enlivening
company
of
the
brave
chickadees
and
nuthatches
the
winter
stars
far
surpassed
those
of
our
stormy
scotland
in
brightness
and
we
gazed
and
gazed
as
though
we
had
never
seen
stars
before
oftentimes
the
heavens
were
made
still
more
glorious
by
auroras
the
long
lance
rays
called
merry
dancers
in
scotland
streaming
with
startling
tremulous
motion
to
the
zenith
usually
the
electric
auroral
light
is
white
or
pale
yellow
but
in
the
third
or
fourth
of
our
wisconsin
winters
there
was
a
magnificently
colored
aurora
that
was
seen
and
admired
over
nearly
all
the
continent
the
whole
sky
was
draped
in
graceful
purple
and
crimson
folds
glorious
beyond
description
father
called
us
out
into
the
yard
in
front
of
the
house
where
we
had
a
wide
view
crying
come
come
mother
come
bairns
and
see
the
glory
of
god
all
the
sky
is
clad
in
a
robe
of
red
light
look
straight
up
to
the
crown
where
the
folds
are
gathered
hush
and
wonder
and
adore
for
surely
this
is
the
clothing
of
the
lord
himself
and
perhaps
he
will
even
now
appear
looking
down
from
his
high
heaven
this
celestial
show
was
far
more
glorious
than
anything
we
had
ever
yet
beheld
and
throughout
that
wonderful
winter
hardly
anything
else
was
spoken
of
we
even
enjoyed
the
snowstorms
the
thronging
crystals
like
daisies
coming
down
separate
and
distinct
were
very
different
from
the
tufted
flakes
we
enjoyed
so
much
in
scotland
when
we
ran
into
the
midst
of
the
feathery
throng
shouting
with
enthusiasm
plucking
her
doos
jennie
plucking
her
doos
doves
nature
has
many
ways
of
thinning
and
pruning
and
trimming
her
forests
heavy
snow
and
to
shatter
and
blow
down
whole
trees
here
and
there
or
break
off
branches
as
required
the
results
of
these
methods
i
have
observed
in
different
forests
but
only
once
have
i
seen
pruning
by
rain
the
rain
froze
on
the
trees
as
it
fell
and
grew
so
thick
and
heavy
that
many
of
them
lost
a
third
or
more
of
their
branches
the
view
of
the
woods
after
the
storm
had
passed
and
the
sun
shone
forth
was
something
never
to
be
forgotten
every
twig
and
branch
and
rugged
trunk
was
encased
in
pure
crystal
ice
and
each
oak
and
hickory
and
willow
became
a
fairy
crystal
palace
such
dazzling
brilliance
such
effects
of
white
light
and
irised
light
glowing
and
flashing
i
had
never
seen
before
nor
have
i
since
this
sudden
change
of
the
leafless
woods
to
glowing
silver
was
like
the
great
aurora
spoken
of
for
years
and
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
many
pictures
that
enriches
my
life
and
besides
the
great
shows
there
were
thousands
of
others
even
in
the
coldest
weather
manifesting
the
utmost
fineness
and
tenderness
of
beauty
and
affording
noble
compensation
for
hardship
and
pain
one
of
the
most
striking
of
the
winter
sounds
was
the
loud
roaring
and
rumbling
of
the
ice
on
our
lake
from
its
shrinking
and
expanding
with
the
changes
of
the
weather
the
fishermen
who
were
catching
pickerel
said
that
they
had
no
luck
when
this
roaring
was
going
on
above
the
fish
i
remember
how
frightened
we
boys
were
when
on
one
of
our
new
year
holidays
we
were
taking
a
walk
on
the
ice
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
sudden
rumbling
roar
beneath
our
feet
and
running
on
ahead
of
us
creaking
and
whooping
as
if
all
the
ice
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
thick
was
breaking
in
the
neighborhood
of
our
wisconsin
farm
there
were
extensive
swamps
consisting
in
great
part
of
a
thick
sod
of
very
tough
carex
roots
covering
thin
watery
lakes
of
mud
they
originated
in
glacier
lakes
that
were
gradually
overgrown
this
sod
was
so
tough
that
oxen
with
loaded
wagons
could
be
driven
over
it
without
cutting
down
through
it
although
it
was
afloat
the
carpenters
who
came
to
build
our
frame
house
noticing
how
the
sedges
sunk
beneath
their
feet
said
that
if
they
should
break
through
they
would
probably
be
well
on
their
way
to
california
before
touching
bottom
on
the
contrary
all
these
are
shallow
as
compared
with
their
width
when
we
went
into
the
wisconsin
woods
there
was
not
a
single
or
the
only
road
was
an
indian
trail
along
the
fox
river
between
portage
and
packwauckee
lake
of
course
the
deer
foxes
badgers
coons
skunks
and
even
the
squirrels
had
tracks
from
their
dens
and
in
thickets
hollow
trees
and
the
ground
but
they
did
not
reach
far
and
but
little
noise
was
made
by
the
travelers
in
passing
over
them
only
a
slight
rustling
and
swishing
among
fallen
leaves
and
grass
corduroying
the
swamps
formed
the
principal
part
of
among
the
early
settlers
for
many
a
day
at
these
annual
gatherings
opportunity
was
offered
for
discussion
of
the
news
politics
religion
war
the
state
of
the
crops
comparative
advantages
of
the
new
country
over
the
old
and
so
forth
but
the
principal
opportunities
recurring
every
week
were
the
hours
after
sunday
church
services
i
remember
hearing
long
talks
on
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
indian
corn
the
wonderful
melons
so
wondrous
fine
for
sloken
a
body
on
hot
days
their
contempt
for
tomatoes
so
fine
to
look
at
with
their
sunny
colors
and
so
disappointing

the
miserable

the
character

etcetera
then
there
were
long
discussions
about
the
russian
war
news
of
which
was
eagerly
gleaned
from
greeley
new
york
tribune
the
great
battles
of
the
alma
the
charges
at
balaklava
and
inkerman
the
siege
of
sebastopol
the

genius
of

the
character
of

the
character
of
the
russian
soldier
his
stubborn
bravery
who
for
the
first
time
in
history
withstood
the
british
bayonet
charges
the
probable
outcome
of
the
terrible
war
the
fate
of
turkey
and
so
forth
very
few
of
our
neighbors
gave
much
heed
to
what
are
called
on
the
contrary
they
were
regarded
as
a
sort
of
humbug
some
of
these
spirits
seem
to
be
stout
fellows
judging
by
the
weights
they
lift
and
the
heavy
furniture
they
bang
about
but
they
do
no
good
work
that
i
know
of
never
saw
wood
grind
corn
cook
feed
the
hungry
or
go
to
the
help
of
poor
anxious
mothers
at
the
bedsides
of
their
sick
children
i
noticed
when
i
was
a
boy
that
it
was
not
the
strongest
characters
who
followed
mediums
when
a
was
at
its
height
in
wisconsin
one
of
our
neighbors
an
old
scotchman
remarked
thay
puir
silly
may
gang
to
the
deil
wi
their
speerits
for
they
dae
nae
gude
and
i
think
the
deil
their
fayther
although
in
the
spring
of
there
was
no
other
settler
within
a
radius
of
four
miles
of
our
fountain
lake
farm
in
three
or
four
years
almost
every
of
government
land
was
taken
up
mostly
by
enthusiastic
homeseekers
from
great
britain
with
only
here
and
there
yankee
families
from
adjacent
states
who
had
come
drifting
indefinitely
westward
in
covered
wagons
seeking
their
fortunes
like
winged
seeds
all
alike
striking
root
and
gripping
the
glacial
drift
soil
as
naturally
as
oak
and
hickory
trees
happy
and
hopeful
establishing
homes
and
making
wider
and
wider
fields
in
the
hospitable
wilderness
the
axe
and
plough
were
kept
very
busy
cattle
horses
sheep
and
pigs
multiplied
barns
and
were
filled
up
and
man
and
beast
were
well
fed
a
schoolhouse
was
built
which
was
used
also
for
a
church
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
new
country
began
to
look
like
an
old
one
comparatively
few
of
the
first
settlers
suffered
from
serious
accidents
one
of
our
neighbors
had
a
finger
shot
off
and
on
a
bitter
frosty
night
had
to
be
taken
to
a
surgeon
in
portage
in
a
sled
drawn
by
slow
plodding
oxen
to
have
the
shattered
stump
dressed
another
fell
from
his
wagon
and
was
killed
by
the
wheel
passing
over
his
body
an
acre
of
ground
was
reserved
and
fenced
for
graves
and
soon
consumption
came
to
fill
it
one
of
the
saddest
instances
was
that
of
a
scotch
family
from
edinburgh
consisting
of
a
father
son
and
daughter
who
settled
on
eighty
acres
of
land
within
half
a
mile
of
our
place
the
daughter
died
of
consumption
the
third
year
after
their
arrival
the
son
one
or
two
years
later
and
at
last
the
father
followed
his
two
children
thus
sadly
ended
bright
hopes
and
dreams
of
a
happy
home
in
rich
and
free
america
another
neighbor
i
remember
after
a
lingering
illness
died
of
the
same
disease
in
midwinter
and
his
funeral
was
attended
by
the
neighbors
in
sleighs
during
a
driving
snowstorm
when
the
thermometer
was
fifteen
or
twenty
degrees
below
zero
the
great
white
plague
carried
off
another
of
our
near
neighbors
a
fine
scotchman
the
father
of
eight
promising
boys
when
he
was
only
about
years
of
age
most
of
those
who
suffered
from
this
disease
seemed
hopeful
and
cheerful
up
to
a
very
short
time
before
their
death
but
reid
i
remember
on
one
of
his
last
visits
to
our
house
said
with
brave
resignation
i
know
that
never
more
in
this
world
can
i
be
well
but
i
must
just
submit
i
must
just
submit
one
of
the
saddest
deaths
from
other
causes
than
consumption
was
that
of
a
poor
man
whose
brother
a
sturdy
devout
severe
puritan
was
a
very
hard
taskmaster
poor
charlie
was
kept
steadily
at
work
although
he
was
not
able
to
do
much
for
his
body
was
about
as
feeble
as
his
mind
he
never
could
be
taught
the
right
use
of
an
axe
and
when
he
was
set
to
chopping
down
trees
for
firewood
he
feebly
hacked
and
chipped
round
and
round
them
sometimes
spending
several
days
in
nibbling
down
a
tree
that
a
beaver
might
have
gnawed
down
in
half
the
time
occasionally
when
he
had
an
extra
large
tree
to
chop
he
would
go
home
and
report
that
the
tree
was
too
tough
and
strong
for
him
and
that
he
could
never
make
it
fall
then
his
brother
calling
him
a
useless
creature
would
fell
it
with
a
few
strokes
and
leave
charlie
to
nibble
away
at
it
for
weeks
trying
to
make
it
into
his
guardian
brother
delighting
in
hard
work
and
able
for
anything
was
as
remarkable
for
strength
of
body
and
mind
as
poor
charlie
for
childishness
all
the
neighbors
pitied
charlie
especially
the
women
who
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
give
him
kind
words
cookies
and
pie
above
all
they
bestowed
natural
sympathy
on
the
poor
imbecile
as
if
he
were
an
unfortunate
motherless
child
in
particular
his
nearest
neighbors
scotch
highlanders
warmly
welcomed
him
to
their
home
and
never
wearied
in
doing
everything
that
tender
sympathy
could
suggest
to
those
friends
he
ran
gladly
at
every
opportunity
but
after
years
of
suffering
from
overwork
and
illness
his
feeble
health
failed
and
he
told
his
scotch
friends
one
day
that
he
was
not
able
to
work
any
more
or
do
anything
that
his
brother
wanted
him
to
do
that
he
was
tired
of
life
and
that
he
had
come
to
thank
them
for
their
kindness
and
to
bid
them
for
he
was
going
to
drown
himself
in
lake
oh
charlie
charlie
they
cried
you
must
talk
that
way
cheer
up
you
will
soon
be
stronger
we
all
love
you
cheer
up
cheer
up
and
always
come
here
whenever
you
need
anything
oh
no
my
friends
he
pathetically
replied
i
know
you
love
me
but
i
ca
cheer
up
any
more
my
heart
gone
and
i
want
to
die
next
day
when
anderson
a
carpenter
whose
house
was
on
the
west
shore
of
our
lake
was
going
to
a
spring
he
saw
a
man
wade
out
through
the
rushes
and
and
throw
himself
forward
into
deep
water
this
was
poor
charlie
fortunately
anderson
had
a
skiff
close
by
and
as
the
distance
was
not
great
he
reached
the
imbecile
in
time
to
save
his
life
and
after
trying
to
cheer
him
took
him
home
to
his
brother
but
even
this
terrible
proof
of
despair
failed
to
soften
his
brother
he
seemed
to
regard
the
attempt
at
suicide
simply
as
a
crime
calculated
to
bring
harm
to
religion
though
snatched
from
the
lake
to
his
bed
poor
charlie
lived
only
a
few
days
longer
a
physician
who
was
called
when
his
health
first
became
seriously
impaired
reported
that
he
was
suffering
from
disease
after
all
was
over
the
stoical
brother
walked
over
to
the
neighbor
who
had
saved
charlie
from
drowning
and
after
talking
on
ordinary
affairs
crops
the
weather
said
in
a
careless
tone
i
have
a
little
job
of
carpenter
work
for
you
mr
anderson
what
is
it
mr
i
want
you
to
make
a
coffin
a
coffin
said
the
startled
carpenter
who
is
dead
charlie
he
coolly
replied
all
the
neighbors
were
in
tears
over
the
poor
child
man
fate
but
strange
to
say
the
brother
who
had
faithfully
cared
for
him
controlled
and
concealed
all
his
natural
affection
as
incompatible
with
sound
faith
the
mixed
lot
of
settlers
around
us
offered
a
favorable
field
for
observation
of
the
different
kinds
of
people
of
our
own
race
we
were
swift
to
note
the
way
they
behaved
the
differences
in
their
religion
and
morals
and
in
their
ways
of
drawing
a
living
from
the
same
kind
of
soil
under
the
same
general
conditions
how
they
protected
themselves
from
the
weather
how
they
were
influenced
by
new
doctrines
and
old
ones
seen
in
new
lights
in
preaching
lecturing
debating
bringing
up
their
children
and
how
they
regarded
the
indians
those
first
settlers
and
owners
of
the
ground
that
was
being
made
into
farms
i
well
remember
my
father
discussing
with
a
scotch
neighbor
a
george
mair
the
indian
question
as
to
the
rightful
ownership
of
the
soil
mair
remarked
one
day
that
it
was
pitiful
to
see
how
the
unfortunate
indians
children
of
nature
living
on
the
natural
products
of
the
soil
hunting
fishing
and
even
cultivating
small
on
the
most
fertile
spots
were
now
being
robbed
of
their
lands
and
pushed
ruthlessly
back
into
narrower
and
narrower
limits
by
alien
races
who
were
cutting
off
their
means
of
livelihood
father
replied
that
surely
it
could
never
have
been
the
intention
of
god
to
allow
indians
to
rove
and
hunt
over
so
fertile
a
country
and
hold
it
forever
in
unproductive
wildness
while
scotch
and
irish
and
english
farmers
could
put
it
to
so
much
better
use
where
an
indian
required
thousands
of
acres
for
his
family
these
acres
in
the
hands
of
industrious
farmers
would
support
ten
or
a
hundred
times
more
people
in
a
far
worthier
manner
while
at
the
same
time
helping
to
spread
the
gospel
mair
urged
that
such
farming
as
our
first
immigrants
were
practicing
was
in
many
ways
rude
and
full
of
the
mistakes
of
ignorance
yet
rude
as
it
was
and
as
were
most
of
our
wisconsin
farms
by
unskillful
inexperienced
settlers
who
had
been
merchants
and
mechanics
and
servants
in
the
old
countries
how
should
we
like
to
have
specially
trained
and
educated
farmers
drive
us
out
of
our
homes
and
farms
such
as
they
were
making
use
of
the
same
argument
that
god
could
never
have
intended
such
ignorant
unprofitable
devastating
farmers
as
we
were
to
occupy
land
upon
which
scientific
farmers
could
raise
five
or
ten
times
as
much
on
each
acre
as
we
did
and
i
well
remember
thinking
that
mair
had
the
better
side
of
the
argument
it
then
seemed
to
me
that
whatever
the
final
outcome
might
be
it
was
at
this
stage
of
the
fight
only
an
example
of
the
rule
of
might
with
but
little
or
no
thought
for
the
right
or
welfare
of
the
other
fellow
if
he
were
the
weaker
that
they
should
take
who
had
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
as
wordsworth
makes
the
marauding
scottish
highlanders
say
many
of
our
old
neighbors
toiled
and
sweated
and
grubbed
themselves
into
their
graves
years
before
their
natural
dying
days
in
getting
a
living
on
a
of
land
and
vaguely
trying
to
get
rich
while
bread
and
raiment
might
have
been
serenely
won
on
less
than
a
fourth
of
this
land
and
time
gained
to
get
better
acquainted
with
god
i
was
put
to
the
plough
at
the
age
of
twelve
when
my
head
reached
but
little
above
the
handles
and
for
many
years
i
had
to
do
the
greater
part
of
the
ploughing
it
was
hard
work
for
so
small
a
boy
nevertheless
as
good
ploughing
was
exacted
from
me
as
if
i
were
a
man
and
very
soon
i
had
to
become
a
good
ploughman
or
rather
ploughboy
none
could
draw
a
straighter
furrow
for
the
first
few
years
the
work
was
particularly
hard
on
account
of
the
that
had
to
be
dodged
later
the
stumps
were
all
dug
and
chopped
out
to
make
way
for
the
mccormick
reaper
and
because
i
proved
to
be
the
best
chopper
and
i
had
nearly
all
of
it
to
myself
it
was
dull
hard
work
leaning
over
on
my
knees
all
day
chopping
out
those
tough
oak
and
hickory
stumps
deep
down
below
the
crowns
of
the
big
roots
some
though
fortunately
not
many
were
two
feet
or
more
in
diameter
and
as
i
was
the
eldest
boy
the
greater
part
of
all
the
other
hard
work
of
the
farm
quite
naturally
fell
on
me
i
had
to
split
rails
for
long
lines
of
zigzag
fences
the
trees
that
were
tall
enough
and
straight
enough
to
afford
one
or
two
logs
ten
feet
long
were
used
for
rails
the
others
too
knotty
or
were
disposed
of
in
log
and
cordwood
fences
making
rails
was
hard
work
and
required
no
little
skill
i
used
to
cut
and
split
a
hundred
a
day
from
our
short
knotty
oak
timber
swinging
the
axe
and
heavy
mallet
often
with
sore
hands
from
early
morning
to
night
father
was
not
successful
as
a
after
trying
the
work
with
me
a
day
or
two
he
in
despair
left
it
all
to
me
i
rather
liked
it
for
i
was
proud
of
my
skill
and
tried
to
believe
that
i
was
as
tough
as
the
timber
i
mauled
though
this
and
other
heavy
jobs
stopped
my
growth
and
earned
for
me
the
title
runt
of
the
family
in
those
early
days
long
before
the
great
machines
came
to
our
help
almost
everything
connected
with
abounded
in
trying
work
cradling
in
the
long
sweaty
raking
and
binding
stacking
thrashing
and
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
our
fierce
way
of
getting
the
grain
from
the
ground
was
too
closely
connected
with
the
staff
of
life
naturally
beautiful
oftentimes
suggested
the
spade
men
and
boys
and
in
those
days
even
women
and
girls
were
cut
down
while
cutting
the
wheat
the
fat
folk
grew
lean
and
the
lean
leaner
while
the
rosy
cheeks
brought
from
scotland
and
other
cool
countries
across
the
sea
faded
to
yellow
like
the
wheat
we
were
all
made
slaves
through
the
vice
of
the
same
was
in
great
part
true
in
making
hay
to
keep
the
cattle
and
horses
through
the
long
winters
we
were
called
in
the
morning
at
four
and
seldom
got
to
bed
before
nine
making
a
broiling
seething
day
seventeen
hours
long
loaded
with
heavy
work
while
i
was
only
a
small
stunted
boy
and
a
few
years
later
my
brothers
david
and
daniel
and
my
older
sisters
had
to
endure
about
as
much
as
i
did
in
the
harvest
and
and
when
we
arose
from
our
clammy
beds
our
cotton
shirts
clung
to
our
backs
as
wet
with
sweat
as
the
of
swimmers
and
remained
so
all
the
long
sweltering
days
in
mowing
and
cradling
the
most
exhausting
of
all
the
farm
work
i
made
matters
worse
by
foolish
ambition
in
keeping
ahead
of
the
hired
men
never
a
warning
word
was
spoken
of
the
dangers
of
on
the
contrary
even
when
sick
we
were
held
to
our
tasks
as
long
as
we
could
stand
once
in
i
had
the
mumps
and
was
unable
to
swallow
any
food
except
milk
but
this
was
not
allowed
to
make
any
difference
while
i
staggered
with
weakness
and
sometimes
fell
headlong
among
the
sheaves
only
once
was
i
allowed
to
leave
the
when
i
was
stricken
down
with
pneumonia
i
lay
gasping
for
weeks
but
the
scotch
are
hard
to
kill
and
i
pulled
through
no
physician
was
called
for
father
was
an
enthusiast
and
always
said
and
believed
that
god
and
hard
work
were
by
far
the
best
doctors
none
of
our
neighbors
were
so
excessively
industrious
as
father
though
nearly
all
of
the
scotch
english
and
irish
worked
too
hard
trying
to
make
good
homes
and
to
lay
up
money
enough
for
comfortable
independence
excepting
small
few
of
them
had
owned
land
in
the
old
country
here
their
craving
was
satisfied
and
they
were
naturally
proud
of
their
farms
and
tried
to
keep
them
as
neat
and
clean
and
as
gardens
to
accomplish
this
without
the
means
for
hiring
help
was
impossible
flowers
were
planted
about
the
neatly
kept
log
or
frame
houses
barnyards
granaries
were
kept
in
about
as
neat
order
as
the
homes
and
the
fences
and
were
rigidly
straight
but
every
uncut
weed
distressed
them
so
also
did
every
ungathered
ear
of
grain
and
all
that
was
lost
by
birds
and
gophers
and
this
overcarefulness
bred
endless
work
and
worry
as
for
money
for
many
a
year
there
was
precious
little
of
it
in
the
country
for
anybody
eggs
sold
at
six
cents
a
dozen
in
trade
and
calico
was
exchanged
at
cents
a
yard
wheat
brought
fifty
cents
a
bushel
in
trade
to
get
cash
for
it
before
the
portage
railway
was
built
it
had
to
be
hauled
to
milwaukee
a
hundred
miles
away
on
the
other

food
was
abundant
eggs
chickens
pigs
cattle
wheat
corn

vegetables
of
the
best
and
wonderful
melons
as
luxuries
no
other
wild
country
i
have
ever
known
extended
a
kinder
welcome
to
poor
immigrants
on
the
arrival
in
the
spring
a
log
house
could
be
built
a
few
acres
ploughed
the
virgin
sod
planted
with
corn
potatoes
and
enough
raised
to
keep
a
family
comfortably
the
very
first
year
and
wild
hay
for
cows
and
oxen
grew
in
abundance
on
the
numerous
meadows
the
american
settlers
were
wisely
content
with
smaller
fields
and
less
of
everything
kept
indoors
during
excessively
hot
or
cold
weather
rested
when
tired
went
off
fishing
and
hunting
at
the
most
favorable
times
and
seasons
of
the
day
and
year
gathered
nuts
and
berries
and
in
general
tranquilly
accepted
all
the
good
things
the
fertile
wilderness
offered
after
eight
years
of
this
dreary
work
of
clearing
the
fountain
lake
farm
fencing
it
and
getting
it
in
perfect
order
building
a
frame
house
and
the
necessary
outbuildings
for
the
cattle
and
horses
after
all
this
had
been
victoriously
accomplished
and
we
had
made
out
to
escape
with
life
father
bought
a
of
wild
land
about
four
or
five
miles
to
the
eastward
and
began
all
over
again
to
clear
and
fence
and
break
up
other
fields
for
a
new
farm
doubling
all
the
stunting
heartbreaking
chopping
grubbing
and
so
forth
by
this
time
i
had
learned
to
run
the
breaking
plough
most
of
these
ploughs
were
very
large
turning
furrows
from
eighteen
inches
to
two
feet
wide
and
were
drawn
by
four
or
five
yoke
of
oxen
they
were
used
only
for
the
first
ploughing
in
breaking
up
the
wild
sod
woven
into
a
tough
mass
chiefly
by
the
cordlike
roots
of
perennial
grasses
reinforced
by
the
of
oak
and
hickory
bushes
called
grubs
some
of
which
were
more
than
a
century
old
and
four
or
five
inches
in
diameter
in
the
hardest
ploughing
on
the
most
difficult
ground
the
grubs
were
said
to
be
as
thick
as
the
hair
on
a
dog
back
if
in
good
trim
the
plough
cut
through
and
turned
over
these
grubs
as
if
the
wood
were
soft
like
the
flesh
of
carrots
and
turnips
but
if
not
in
good
trim
the
grubs
promptly
tossed
the
plough
out
of
the
ground
a
stout
highland
scot
our
neighbor
whose
plough
was
in
bad
order
and
who
did
not
know
how
to
trim
it
was
vainly
trying
to
keep
it
in
the
ground
by
main
strength
while
his
son
who
was
driving
and
merrily
whipping
up
the
cattle
would
cry
encouragingly
haud
her
in
fayther
haud
her
in
but
hoo
i
the
deil
can
i
haud
her
in
when
she
no
in
his
perspiring
father
would
reply
gasping
for
breath
between
each
word
on
the
contrary
with
the
share
and
coulter
sharp
and
nicely
adjusted
the
plough
instead
of
shying
at
every
grub
and
jumping
out
ran
straight
ahead
without
need
of
steering
or
holding
and
gripped
the
ground
so
firmly
that
it
could
hardly
be
thrown
out
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
our
breaker
turned
a
furrow
two
feet
wide
and
on
our
best
land
where
the
sod
was
toughest
held
so
firm
a
grip
that
at
the
end
of
the
field
my
brother
who
was
driving
the
oxen
had
to
come
to
my
assistance
in
throwing
it
over
on
its
side
to
be
drawn
around
the
end
of
the
landing
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
set
it
up
again
but
i
learned
to
keep
that
plough
in
such
trim
that
after
i
got
started
on
a
new
furrow
i
used
to
ride
on
the
crossbar
between
the
handles
with
my
feet
resting
comfortably
on
the
beam
without
having
to
steady
or
steer
it
in
any
way
on
the
whole
length
of
the
field
unless
we
had
to
go
round
a
stump
for
it
sawed
through
the
biggest
grubs
without
flinching
the
growth
of
these
grubs
was
interesting
to
me
when
an
acorn
or
had
sent
up
its
first
season
sprout
a
few
inches
long
it
was
burned
off
in
the
autumn
grass
fires
but
the
root
continued
to
hold
on
to
life
formed
a
callus
over
the
wound
and
sent
up
one
or
more
shoots
the
next
spring
next
autumn
these
new
shoots
were
burned
off
but
the
root
and
calloused
head
about
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
continued
to
grow
and
send
up
more
new
shoots
and
so
on
almost
every
year
until
very
old
probably
far
more
than
a
century
while
the
tops
which
would
naturally
have
become
tall
trees
were
only
mere
sprouts
seldom
more
than
two
years
old
thus
the
ground
was
kept
open
like
a
prairie
with
only
five
or
six
trees
to
the
acre
which
had
escaped
the
fire
by
having
the
good
fortune
to
grow
on
a
bare
spot
at
the
door
of
a
fox
or
badger
den
or
between
straggling
wide
apart
on
the
poorest
sandy
soil
the
uniformly
rich
soil
of
the
illinois
and
wisconsin
prairies
produced
so
close
and
tall
a
growth
of
grasses
for
fires
that
no
tree
could
live
on
it
had
there
been
no
fires
these
fine
prairies
so
marked
a
feature
of
the
country
would
have
been
covered
by
the
heaviest
forests
as
soon
as
the
oak
openings
in
our
neighborhood
were
settled
and
the
farmers
had
prevented
running
the
grubs
grew
up
into
trees
and
formed
tall
thickets
so
dense
that
it
was
difficult
to
walk
through
them
and
every
trace
of
the
sunny
openings
vanished
illustration
the
hickory
hill
house
built
in
we
called
our
second
farm
hickory
hill
from
its
many
fine
hickory
trees
and
the
long
gentle
slope
leading
up
to
it
compared
with
fountain
lake
farm
it
lay
high
and
dry
the
land
was
better
but
it
had
no
living
water
no
spring
or
stream
or
meadow
or
lake
a
well
ninety
feet
deep
had
to
be
dug
all
except
the
first
ten
feet
or
so
in
sandstone
when
the
sandstone
was
struck
my
father
on
the
advice
of
a
man
who
had
worked
in
mines
tried
to
blast
the
rock
but
from
lack
of
skill
the
blasting
went
on
very
slowly
and
father
decided
to
have
me
do
all
the
work
with
mason
chisels
a
long
hard
job
with
a
good
deal
of
danger
in
it
i
had
to
sit
cramped
in
a
space
about
three
feet
in
diameter
and
wearily
chip
chip
with
heavy
hammer
and
chisels
from
early
morning
until
dark
day
after
day
for
weeks
and
months
in
the
morning
father
and
david
lowered
me
in
a
wooden
bucket
by
a
windlass
hauled
up
what
chips
were
left
from
the
night
before
then
went
away
to
the
farm
work
and
left
me
until
noon
when
they
hoisted
me
out
for
dinner
after
dinner
i
was
promptly
lowered
again
the
forenoon
accumulation
of
chips
hoisted
out
of
the
way
and
i
was
left
until
night
one
morning
after
the
dreary
bore
was
about
eighty
feet
deep
my
life
was
all
but
lost
in
deadly
carbonic
acid
gas
that
had
settled
at
the
bottom
during
the
night
instead
of
clearing
away
the
chips
as
usual
when
i
was
lowered
to
the
bottom
i
swayed
back
and
forth
and
began
to
sink
under
the
poison
father
alarmed
that
i
did
not
make
any
noise
shouted
what
keeping
you
so
still
to
which
he
got
no
reply
just
as
i
was
settling
down
against
the
side
of
the
wall
i
happened
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
branch
of
a
tree
which
leaned
out
over
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
this
suddenly
awakened
me
and
to
father
excited
shouting
i
feebly
murmured
take
me
out
but
when
he
began
to
hoist
he
found
i
was
not
in
the
bucket
and
in
wild
alarm
shouted
get
in
get
in
the
bucket
and
hold
on
hold
on
somehow
i
managed
to
get
into
the
bucket
and
that
is
all
i
remembered
until
i
was
dragged
out
violently
gasping
for
breath
one
of
our
near
neighbors
a
stone
mason
and
miner
by
the
name
of
william
duncan
came
to
see
me
and
after
hearing
the
particulars
of
the
accident
he
solemnly
said
weel
johnnie
it
god
mercy
that
alive
many
a
companion
of
mine
have
i
seen
dead
with
but
none
that
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
was
so
near
to
death
in
it
as
you
were
and
escaped
without
help
duncan
taught
father
to
throw
water
down
the
shaft
to
absorb
the
gas
and
also
to
drop
a
bundle
of
brush
or
hay
attached
to
a
light
rope
dropping
it
again
and
again
to
carry
down
pure
air
and
stir
up
the
poison
when
after
a
day
or
two
i
had
recovered
from
the
shock
father
lowered
me
again
to
my
work
after
taking
the
precaution
to
test
the
air
with
a
candle
and
stir
it
up
well
with
a
bundle
the
weary
went
on
as
before
only
more
slowly
until
ninety
feet
down
when
at
last
i
struck
a
fine
hearty
gush
of
water
constant
dropping
wears
away
stone
so
does
constant
chipping
while
at
the
same
time
wearing
away
the
chipper
father
never
spent
an
hour
in
that
well
he
trusted
me
to
sink
it
straight
and
plumb
and
i
did
and
built
a
fine
covered
top
over
it
and
swung
two
buckets
in
it
from
which
we
all
drank
for
many
a
day
the
arrived
in
america
long
before
we
boys
did
but
several
years
passed
ere
we
noticed
any
on
our
farm
the
introduction
of
the
into
flowery
america
formed
a
grand
epoch
in
bee
history
this
sweet
humming
creature
companion
and
friend
of
the
flowers
is
now
distributed
over
the
greater
part
of
the
continent
filling
countless
hollows
in
rocks
and
trees
with
honey
as
well
as
the
millions
of
hives
prepared
for
them
by
who
keep
and
tend
their
flocks
of
sweet
winged
cattle
as
shepherds
keep
sheep
a
charming
employment
like
directing
sunbeams
as
thoreau
says
the
indians
call
the
the
white
man
fly
and
though
they
had
long
been
acquainted
with
several
species
of
bumblebees
that
yielded
more
or
less
honey
how
gladly
surprised
they
must
have
been
when
they
discovered
that
in
the
hollow
trees
where
before
they
had
found
only
coons
or
squirrels
they
found
swarms
of
brown
flies
with
fifty
or
even
a
hundred
pounds
of
honey
sealed
up
in
beautiful
cells
with
their
keen
hunting
senses
they
of
course
were
not
slow
to
learn
the
habits
of
the
little
brown
immigrants
and
the
best
methods
of
tracing
them
to
their
sweet
homes
however
well
hidden
during
the
first
few
years
none
were
seen
on
our
farm
though
we
sometimes
heard
hired
men
talking
about
lining
bees
none
of
us
boys
ever
found
a
bee
tree
or
tried
to
find
any
until
about
ten
years
after
our
arrival
in
the
woods
on
the
hickory
hill
farm
there
is
a
ridge
of
moraine
material
rather
dry
but
flowery
with
goldenrods
and
asters
of
many
species
upon
which
we
saw
bees
feeding
in
the
late
autumn
just
when
their
hives
were
fullest
of
honey
and
it
occurred
to
me
one
day
after
i
was
of
age
and
my
own
master
that
i
must
try
to
find
a
bee
tree
i
made
a
little
box
about
six
inches
long
and
four
inches
deep
and
wide
bought
half
a
pound
of
honey
went
to
the
goldenrod
hill
swept
a
bee
into
the
box
and
closed
it
the
lid
had
a
pane
of
glass
in
it
so
i
could
see
when
the
bee
had
sucked
its
fill
and
was
ready
to
go
home
at
first
it
groped
around
trying
to
get
out
but
smelling
the
honey
it
seemed
to
forget
everything
else
and
while
it
was
feasting
i
carried
the
box
and
a
small
stake
to
an
open
spot
where
i
could
see
about
me
fixed
the
stake
in
the
ground
and
placed
the
box
on
the
flat
top
of
it
when
i
thought
that
the
little
feaster
must
be
about
full
i
opened
the
box
but
it
was
in
no
hurry
to
fly
it
slowly
crawled
up
to
the
edge
of
the
box
lingered
a
minute
or
two
cleaning
its
legs
that
had
become
sticky
with
honey
and
when
it
took
wing
instead
of
making
what
is
called
a
for
home
it
buzzed
around
the
box
and
minutely
examined
it
as
if
trying
to
fix
a
clear
picture
of
it
in
its
mind
so
as
to
be
able
to
recognize
it
when
it
returned
for
another
load
then
circled
around
at
a
little
distance
as
if
looking
for
something
to
locate
it
by
i
was
the
nearest
object
and
the
thoughtful
worker
buzzed
in
front
of
my
face
and
took
a
good
stare
at
me
and
then
flew
up
on
to
the
top
of
an
oak
on
the
side
of
the
open
spot
in
the
centre
of
which
the
was
keeping
a
keen
watch
after
a
minute
or
two
of
rest
or
i
saw
it
fly
in
wide
circles
round
the
tops
of
the
trees
nearest
the
and
after
apparently
satisfying
itself
make
a
for
the
hive
looking
endwise
on
the
line
of
flight
i
saw
that
what
is
called
a
is
not
an
absolutely
straight
line
but
a
line
in
general
straight
made
of
many
slight
wavering
lateral
curves
after
taking
as
true
a
bearing
as
i
could
i
waited
and
watched
in
a
few
minutes
probably
ten
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
bee
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
outleaning
limb
of
the
oak
mentioned
above
as
though
that
was
the
first
point
it
had
fixed
in
its
memory
to
be
depended
on
in
retracing
the
way
back
to
the
from
the
it
came
straight
to
my
head
thence
straight
to
the
box
entered
without
the
least
hesitation
filled
up
and
started
off
after
the
same
preparatory
dressing
and
taking
of
bearings
as
before
then
i
took
particular
pains
to
lay
down
the
exact
course
so
i
would
be
able
to
trace
it
to
the
hive
before
doing
so
however
i
made
an
experiment
to
test
the
worth
of
the
impression
i
had
that
the
little
insect
found
the
way
back
to
the
box
by
fixing
telling
points
in
its
mind
while
it
was
away
i
picked
up
the
and
set
it
on
the
stake
a
few
rods
from
the
position
it
had
thus
far
occupied
and
stood
there
watching
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
the
bee
arrive
at
its
the
overleaning
branch
on
the
and
thence
came
bouncing
down
right
to
the
spaces
in
the
air
which
had
been
occupied
by
my
head
and
the
and
when
the
cunning
little
found
nothing
there
but
empty
air
it
whirled
round
and
round
as
if
confused
and
lost
and
although
i
was
standing
with
the
open
within
fifty
or
sixty
feet
of
the
former
it
could
not
or
at
least
did
not
find
it
now
that
i
had
learned
the
general
direction
of
the
hive
i
pushed
on
in
search
of
it
i
had
gone
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
i
caught
another
bee
which
after
getting
loaded
went
through
the
same
performance
of
circling
round
and
round
the
buzzing
in
front
of
me
and
staring
me
in
the
face
to
be
able
to
recognize
me
but
as
if
the
adjacent
trees
and
bushes
were
sufficiently
well
known
it
simply
looked
around
at
them
and
bolted

i
followed
on
and

discovered

of
a

but
some
lucky
fellow
had
discovered
it
before
me

it
the
robbers
had
chopped
a
large
hole
in
the

out
most
of
the
honey

left
the
poor
bees
late
in

was

to
make
haste
to
gather
all
the
honey

could
from
the

advice
i
learned
arithmetic
in
scotland
without
understanding
any
of
it
though
i
had
the
rules
by
heart
but
when
i
was
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
i
began
to
grow
hungry
for
real
knowledge
and
persuaded
father
who
was
willing
enough
to
have
me
study
provided
my
farm
work
was
kept
up
to
buy
me
a
higher
arithmetic
beginning
at
the
beginning
in
one
summer
i
easily
finished
it
without
assistance
in
the
short
intervals
between
the
end
of
dinner
and
the
afternoon
start
for
the
accomplishing
more
without
a
teacher
in
a
few
scraps
of
time
than
in
years
in
school
before
my
mind
was
ready
for
such
work
then
in
succession
i
took
up
algebra
geometry
and
trigonometry
and
made
some
little
progress
in
each
and
reviewed
grammar
i
was
fond
of
reading
but
father
had
brought
only
a
few
religious
books
from
scotland
fortunately
several
of
our
neighbors
had
brought
a
dozen
or
two
of
all
sorts
of
books
which
i
borrowed
and
read
keeping
all
of
them
except
the
religious
ones
carefully
hidden
from
father
eye
among
these
were
scott
novels
which
like
all
other
novels
were
strictly
forbidden
but
devoured
with
glorious
pleasure
in
secret
father
was
easily
persuaded
to
buy
josephus
wars
of
the
jews
and
history
of
the
reformation
and
i
tried
hard
to
get
him
to
buy
plutarch
lives
which
as
i
told
him
everybody
even
religious
people
praised
as
a
grand
good
book
but
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
old
pagan
until
the
graham
bread
and
doctrines
came
suddenly
into
our
backwoods
neighborhood
making
a
stir
something
like
phrenology
and
which
were
as
mysterious
in
their
attacks
as
influenza
he
then
thought
it
possible
that
plutarch
might
be
turned
to
account
on
the
food
question
by
revealing
what
those
old
greeks
and
romans
ate
to
make
them
strong
and
so
at
last
we
gained
our
glorious
plutarch
dick
christian
philosopher
which
i
borrowed
from
a
neighbor
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
read
in
the
open
trusting
that
the
word
christian
would
be
proof
against
its
cautious
condemnation
but
father
balked
at
the
word
philosopher
and
quoted
from
the
bible
a
verse
which
spoke
of
philosophy
falsely
i
then
ventured
to
speak
in
defense
of
the
book
arguing
that
we
could
not
do
without
at
least
a
little
of
the
most
useful
kinds
of
philosophy
yes
we
can
he
said
with
enthusiasm
the
bible
is
the
only
book
human
beings
can
possibly
require
throughout
all
the
journey
from
earth
to
heaven
but
how
i
contended
can
we
find
the
way
to
heaven
without
the
bible
and
how
after
we
grow
old
can
we
read
the
bible
without
a
little
helpful
science
just
think
father
you
can
not
read
your
bible
without
spectacles
and
millions
of
others
are
in
the
same
fix
and
spectacles
can
not
be
made
without
some
knowledge
of
the
science
of
optics
oh
he
replied
perceiving
the
drift
of
the
argument
there
will
always
be
plenty
of
worldly
people
to
make
spectacles
to
this
i
stubbornly
replied
with
a
quotation
from
the
bible
with
reference
to
the
time
coming
when
all
shall
know
the
lord
from
the
least
even
to
the
greatest
and
then
who
will
make
the
spectacles
but
he
still
objected
to
my
reading
that
book
called
me
a
contumacious
quibbler
too
fond
of
disputation
and
ordered
me
to
return
it
to
the
accommodating
owner
i
managed
however
to
read
it
later
on
the
food
question
father
insisted
that
those
who
argued
for
a
vegetable
diet
were
in
the
right
because
our
teeth
showed
plainly
that
they
were
made
with
reference
to
fruit
and
grain
and
not
for
flesh
like
those
of
dogs
and
wolves
and
tigers
he
therefore
promptly
adopted
a
vegetable
diet
and
requested
mother
to
make
the
bread
from
graham
flour
instead
of
bolted
flour
mother
put
both
kinds
on
the
table
and
meat
also
to
let
all
the
family
take
their
choice
and
while
father
was
insisting
on
the
foolishness
of
eating
flesh
i
came
to
her
help
by
calling
father
attention
to
the
passage
in
the
bible
which
told
the
story
of
elijah
the
prophet
who
when
he
was
pursued
by
enemies
who
wanted
to
take
his
life
was
hidden
by
the
lord
by
the
brook
cherith
and
fed
by
ravens
and
surely
the
lord
knew
what
was
good
to
eat
whether
bread
or
meat
and
on
what
i
asked
did
the
lord
feed
elijah
on
vegetables
or
graham
bread
no
he
directed
the
ravens
to
feed
his
prophet
on
flesh
the
bible
being
the
sole
rule
father
at
once
acknowledged
that
he
was
mistaken
the
lord
never
would
have
sent
flesh
to
elijah
by
the
ravens
if
graham
bread
were
better
i
remember
as
a
great
and
sudden
discovery
that
the
poetry
of
the
bible
shakespeare
and
milton
was
a
source
of
inspiring
exhilarating
uplifting
pleasure
and
i
became
anxious
to
know
all
the
poets
and
saved
up
small
sums
to
buy
as
many
of
their
books
as
possible
within
three
or
four
years
i
was
the
proud
possessor
of
parts
of
shakespeare
milton
cowper
henry
kirke
white
campbell
and
akenside
works
and
quite
a
number
of
others
seldom
read
nowadays
i
think
it
was
in
my
fifteenth
year
that
i
began
to
relish
good
literature
with
enthusiasm
and
smack
my
lips
over
favorite
lines
but
there
was
desperately
little
time
for
reading
even
in
the
winter
evenings
only
a
few
stolen
minutes
now
and
then
father
strict
rule
was
straight
to
bed
immediately
after
family
worship
which
in
winter
was
usually
over
by
eight
i
was
in
the
habit
of
lingering
in
the
kitchen
with
a
book
and
candle
after
the
rest
of
the
family
had
retired
and
considered
myself
fortunate
if
i
got
five
minutes
reading
before
father
noticed
the
light
and
ordered
me
to
bed
an
order
that
of
course
i
immediately
obeyed
but
night
after
night
i
tried
to
steal
minutes
in
the
same
lingering
way
and
how
keenly
precious
those
minutes
were
few
nowadays
can
know
father
failed
perhaps
two
or
three
times
in
a
whole
winter
to
notice
my
light
for
nearly
ten
minutes
magnificent
golden
blocks
of
time
long
to
be
remembered
like
holidays
or
geological
periods
one
evening
when
i
was
reading
church
history
father
was
particularly
irritable
and
called
out
with
emphasis
go
to
bed
must
i
give
you
a
separate
order
every
night
to
get
you
to
go
to
bed
now
i
will
have
no
irregularity
in
the
family
you
go
when
the
rest
go
and
without
my
having
to
tell
you
then
as
an
afterthought
as
if
judging
that
his
words
and
tone
of
voice
were
too
severe
for
so
pardonable
an
offense
as
reading
a
religious
book
he
unwarily
added
if
you
read
get
up
in
the
morning
and
read
you
may
get
up
in
the
morning
as
early
as
you
like
that
night
i
went
to
bed
wishing
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
somebody
or
something
might
call
me
out
of
sleep
to
avail
myself
of
this
wonderful
indulgence
and
next
morning
to
my
joyful
surprise
i
awoke
before
father
called
me
a
boy
sleeps
soundly
after
working
all
day
in
the
snowy
woods
but
that
frosty
morning
i
sprang
out
of
bed
as
if
called
by
a
trumpet
blast
rushed
downstairs
scarce
feeling
my
chilblains
enormously
eager
to
see
how
much
time
i
had
won
and
when
i
held
up
my
candle
to
a
little
clock
that
stood
on
a
bracket
in
the
kitchen
i
found
that
it
was
only
one
i
had
gained
five
hours
almost
half
a
day
five
hours
to
myself
i
said
five
huge
solid
hours
i
can
hardly
think
of
any
other
event
in
my
life
any
discovery
i
ever
made
that
gave
birth
to
joy
so
transportingly
glorious
as
the
possession
of
these
five
frosty
hours
in
the
glad
tumultuous
excitement
of
so
much
suddenly
acquired
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
it
i
first
thought
of
going
on
with
my
reading
but
the
zero
weather
would
make
a
fire
necessary
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
father
might
object
to
the
cost
of
firewood
that
took
time
to
chop
therefore
i
prudently
decided
to
go
down
cellar
and
begin
work
on
a
model
of
a
sawmill
i
had
invented
next
morning
i
managed
to
get
up
at
the
same
gloriously
early
hour
and
though
the
temperature
of
the
cellar
was
a
little
below
the
freezing
point
and
my
light
was
only
a
tallow
candle
the
mill
work
went
joyfully
on
there
were
a
few
tools
in
a
corner
of
the
cellar
a
vise
files
a
hammer
chisels
that
father
had
brought
from
scotland
but
no
saw
excepting
a
coarse
crooked
one
that
was
unfit
for
sawing
dry
hickory
or
oak
so
i
made
a
saw
suitable
for
my
work
out
of
a
strip
of
steel
that
had
formed
part
of
an
corset
that
cut
the
hardest
wood
smoothly
i
also
made
my
own
bradawls
punches
and
a
pair
of
compasses
out
of
wire
and
old
files
my
workshop
was
immediately
under
father
bed
and
the
filing
and
tapping
in
making
cogwheels
journals
cams
must
no
doubt
have
annoyed
him
but
with
the
permission
he
had
granted
in
his
mind
and
doubtless
hoping
that
i
would
soon
tire
of
getting
up
at
one
he
impatiently
waited
about
two
weeks
before
saying
a
word
i
did
not
vary
more
than
five
minutes
from
one
all
winter
nor
did
i
feel
any
bad
effects
whatever
nor
did
i
think
at
all
about
the
subject
as
to
whether
so
little
sleep
might
be
in
any
way
injurious
it
was
a
grand
triumph
of
over
cold
and
common
comfort
and
in
abruptly
cutting
down
my
ten
hours
allowance
of
sleep
to
five
i
simply
felt
that
i
was
rich
beyond
anything
i
could
have
dreamed
of
or
hoped
for
i
was
far
more
than
happy
like
tam
shanter
i
was
glorious
a
the
ills
o
life
victorious
father
as
was
customary
in
scotland
gave
thanks
and
asked
a
blessing
before
meals
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
form
and
decent
christian
manners
for
he
regarded
food
as
a
gift
derived
directly
from
the
hands
of
the
father
in
heaven
therefore
every
meal
to
him
was
a
sacrament
requiring
conduct
and
attitude
of
mind
not
unlike
that
befitting
the
lord
supper
no
idle
word
was
allowed
to
be
spoken
at
our
table
much
less
any
laughing
or
fun
or
when
we
were
at
the
about
two
weeks
after
the
great
golden
father
cleared
his
throat
preliminary
as
we
all
knew
to
saying
something
considered
important
i
feared
that
it
was
to
be
on
the
subject
of
my
early
rising
and
dreaded
the
withdrawal
of
the
permission
he
had
granted
on
account
of
the
noise
i
made
but
still
hoping
that
as
he
had
given
his
word
that
i
might
get
up
as
early
as
i
wished
he
would
as
a
scotchman
stand
to
it
even
though
it
was
given
in
an
unguarded
moment
and
taken
in
a
sense
unreasonably
the
solemn
sacramental
silence
was
broken
by
the
dreaded
question
john
what
time
is
it
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
about
one
i
replied
in
a
low
meek
guilty
tone
of
voice
and
what
kind
of
a
time
is
that
getting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
disturbing
the
whole
family
i
simply
reminded
him
of
the
permission
he
had
freely
granted
me
to
get
up
as
early
as
i
wished
i
it
he
said
in
an
almost
agonized
tone
of
voice
i
i
gave
you
that
miserable
permission
but
i
never
imagined
that
you
would
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
this
i
cautiously
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
listen
for
the
heavenly
call
and
it
never
failed
after
completing
my
sawmill
i
dammed
one
of
the
streams
in
the
meadow
and
put
the
mill
in
operation
this
invention
was
speedily
followed
by
a
lot
of
others
curious
doorlocks
and
latches
thermometers
hygrometers
pyrometers
clocks
a
barometer
an
automatic
contrivance
for
feeding
the
horses
at
any
required
hour
a
and
an
machine
and
so
forth
after
the
sawmill
was
proved
and
discharged
from
my
mind
i
happened
to
think
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
make
a
timekeeper
which
would
tell
the
day
of
the
week
and
the
day
of
the
month
as
well
as
strike
like
a
common
clock
and
point
out
the
hours
also
to
have
an
attachment
whereby
it
could
be
connected
with
a
bedstead
to
set
me
on
my
feet
at
any
hour
in
the
morning
also
to
start
fires
light
lamps
etc
i
had
learned
the
time
laws
of
the
pendulum
from
a
book
but
with
this
exception
i
knew
nothing
of
timekeepers
for
i
had
never
seen
the
inside
of
any
sort
of
clock
or
watch
after
long
brooding
the
novel
clock
was
at
length
completed
in
my
mind
and
was
tried
and
found
to
be
durable
and
to
work
well
and
look
well
before
i
had
begun
to
build
it
in
wood
i
carried
small
parts
of
it
in
my
pocket
to
whittle
at
when
i
was
out
at
work
on
the
farm
using
every
spare
or
stolen
moment
within
reach
without
father
knowing
anything
about
it
in
the
middle
of
summer
when
harvesting
was
in
progress
the
novel
was
nearly
completed
it
was
hidden
upstairs
in
a
spare
bedroom
where
some
tools
were
kept
i
did
the
making
and
mending
on
the
farm
but
one
day
at
noon
when
i
happened
to
be
away
father
went
upstairs
for
a
hammer
or
something
and
discovered
the
mysterious
machine
back
of
the
bedstead
my
sister
margaret
saw
him
on
his
knees
examining
it
and
at
the
first
opportunity
whispered
in
my
ear
john
fayther
saw
that
thing
you
making
upstairs
none
of
the
family
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
they
knew
very
well
that
all
such
work
was
frowned
on
by
father
and
kindly
warned
me
of
any
danger
that
threatened
my
plans
the
fine
invention
seemed
doomed
to
destruction
before
its
commenced
though
i
thought
it
handsome
had
so
long
carried
it
in
my
mind
and
like
the
nest
of
burns
wee
mousie
it
had
cost
me
mony
a
weary
whittling
nibble
when
we
were
at
dinner
several
days
after
the
sad
discovery
father
began
to
clear
his
throat
to
speak
and
i
feared
the
doom
of
martyrdom
was
about
to
be
pronounced
on
my
grand
clock
john
he
inquired
what
is
that
thing
you
are
making
upstairs
i
replied
in
desperation
that
i
did
know
what
to
call
it
what
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
what
you
are
trying
to
do
oh
yes
i
said
i
know
very
well
what
i
am
doing
what
then
is
the
thing
for
it
for
a
lot
of
things
i
replied
but
getting
people
up
early
in
the
morning
is
one
of
the
main
things
it
is
intended
for
therefore
it
might
perhaps
be
called
an
machine
after
getting
up
so
extravagantly
early
all
the
last
memorable
winter
to
make
a
machine
for
getting
up
perhaps
still
earlier
seemed
so
ridiculous
that
he
very
nearly
laughed
but
after
controlling
himself
and
getting
command
of
a
sufficiently
solemn
face
and
voice
he
said
severely
do
you
not
think
it
is
very
wrong
to
waste
your
time
on
such
nonsense
no
i
said
meekly
i
do
think
i
doing
any
wrong
well
he
replied
i
assure
you
i
do
and
if
you
were
only
half
as
zealous
in
the
study
of
religion
as
you
are
in
contriving
and
whittling
these
useless
nonsensical
things
it
would
be
infinitely
better
for
you
i
want
you
to
be
like
paul
who
said
that
he
desired
to
know
nothing
among
men
but
christ
and
him
crucified
to
this
i
made
no
reply
gloomily
believing
my
fine
machine
was
to
be
burned
but
still
taking
what
comfort
i
could
in
realizing
that
anyhow
i
had
enjoyed
inventing
and
making
it
after
a
few
days
finding
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
said
and
that
father
after
all
had
not
had
the
heart
to
destroy
it
all
necessity
for
secrecy
being
ended
i
finished
it
in
the
that
we
had
at
noon
and
set
it
in
the
parlor
between
two
chairs
hung
moraine
boulders
that
had
come
from
the
direction
of
lake
superior
on
it
for
weights
and
set
it
running
we
were
then
hauling
grain
into
the
barn
father
at
this
period
devoted
himself
entirely
to
the
bible
and
did
no
farm
work
whatever
the
clock
had
a
good
loud
tick
and
when
he
heard
it
strike
one
of
my
sisters
told
me
that
he
left
his
study
went
to
the
parlor
got
down
on
his
knees
and
carefully
examined
the
machinery
which
was
all
in
plain
sight
not
being
enclosed
in
a
case
this
he
did
repeatedly
and
evidently
seemed
a
little
proud
of
my
ability
to
invent
and
whittle
such
a
thing
though
careful
to
give
no
encouragement
for
anything
more
of
the
kind
in
future
but
somehow
it
seemed
impossible
to
stop
inventing
and
whittling
faster
than
ever
i
made
another
hickory
clock
shaped
like
a
scythe
to
symbolize
the
scythe
of
father
time
the
pendulum
is
a
bunch
of
arrows
symbolizing
the
flight
of
time
it
hangs
on
a
leafless
mossy
oak
snag
showing
the
effect
of
time
and
on
the
snath
is
written
all
flesh
is
grass
this
especially
the
inscription
rather
pleased
father
and
of
course
mother
and
all
my
sisters
and
brothers
admired
it
like
the
first
it
indicates
the
days
of
the
week
and
month
starts
fires
and
beds
at
any
given
hour
and
minute
and
though
made
more
than
fifty
years
ago
is
still
a
good
timekeeper
my
mind
still
running
on
clocks
i
invented
a
big
one
like
a
town
clock
with
four
dials
with
the
so
large
they
could
be
read
by
all
our
immediate
neighbors
as
well
as
ourselves
when
at
work
in
the
fields
and
on
the
side
next
the
house
the
days
of
the
week
and
month
were
indicated
it
was
to
be
placed
on
the
peak
of
the
barn
roof
but
just
as
it
was
all
but
finished
father
stopped
me
saying
that
it
would
bring
too
many
people
around
the
barn
i
then
asked
permission
to
put
it
on
the
top
of
a
tree
near
the
house
studying
the
larger
main
branches
i
thought
i
could
secure
a
sufficiently
rigid
foundation
for
it
while
the
trimmed
sprays
and
leaves
would
conceal
the
angles
of
the
cabin
required
to
shelter
the
works
from
the
weather
and
the
pendulum
fourteen
feet
long
could
be
snugly
encased
on
the
side
of
the
trunk
nothing
about
the
grand
useful
timekeeper
i
argued
would
disfigure
the
tree
for
it
would
look
something
like
a
big
hawk
nest
but
that
he
objected
would
draw
still
bigger
bothersome
trampling
crowds
about
the
place
for
who
ever
heard
of
anything
so
queer
as
a
big
clock
on
the
top
of
a
tree
so
i
had
to
lay
aside
its
big
wheels
and
cams
and
rest
content
with
the
pleasure
of
inventing
it
and
looking
at
it
in
my
mind
and
listening
to
the
deep
solemn
throbbing
of
its
long
pendulum
with
its
two
old
axes
back
to
back
for
the
bob
one
of
my
inventions
was
a
large
thermometer
made
of
an
iron
rod
about
three
feet
long
and
five
eighths
of
an
inch
in
diameter
that
had
formed
part
of
a
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
this
rod
was
multiplied
by
a
series
of
levers
made
of
strips
of
hoop
iron
the
pressure
of
the
rod
against
the
levers
was
kept
constant
by
a
small
counterweight
so
that
the
slightest
change
in
the
length
of
the
rod
was
instantly
shown
on
a
dial
about
three
feet
wide
multiplied
about
thousand
times
the
was
gained
by
packing
the
rod
in
wet
snow
the
scale
was
so
large
that
the
big
black
hand
on
the
dial
could
be
seen
distinctly
and
the
temperature
read
while
we
were
ploughing
in
the
field
below
the
house
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
caused
the
hand
to
make
several
revolutions
the
number
of
these
revolutions
was
indicated
on
a
small
dial
marked
on
the
larger
one
this
thermometer
was
fastened
on
the
side
of
the
house
and
was
so
sensitive
that
when
any
one
approached
it
within
four
or
five
feet
the
heat
radiated
from
the
observer
body
caused
the
hand
of
the
dial
to
move
so
fast
that
the
motion
was
plainly
visible
and
when
he
stepped
back
the
hand
moved
slowly
back
to
its
normal
position
it
was
regarded
as
a
great
wonder
by
the
neighbors
and
even
by
my
own
father

boys
are
fond
of
the
books
of
travelers
and
i
remember
that
one
day
after
i
had
been
reading
mungo
park
travels
in
africa
mother
said
weel
john
maybe
you
will
travel
like
park
and
humboldt
some
day
father
overheard
her
and
cried
out
in
solemn
deprecation
oh
anne
dinna
put
sic
notions
in
the
laddie
heed
but
at
this
time
there
was
precious
little
need
of
such
prayers
my
brothers
left
the
farm
when
they
came
of
age
but
i
stayed
a
year
longer
loath
to
leave
home
mother
hoped
i
might
be
a
minister
some
day
my
sisters
that
i
would
be
a
great
inventor
i
often
thought
i
should
like
to
be
a
physician
but
i
saw
no
way
of
making
money
and
getting
the
necessary
education
excepting
as
an
inventor
so
as
a
beginning
i
decided
to
try
to
get
into
a
big
shop
or
factory
and
live
a
while
among
machines
but
i
was
naturally
extremely
shy
and
had
been
taught
to
have
a
poor
opinion
of
myself
as
of
no
account
though
all
our
neighbors
encouragingly
called
me
a
genius
sure
to
rise
in
the
world
when
i
was
talking
over
plans
one
day
with
a
friendly
neighbor
he
said
now
john
if
you
wish
to
get
into
a
just
take
some
of
your
inventions
to
the
state
fair
and
you
may
be
sure
that
as
soon
as
they
are
seen
they
will
open
the
door
of
any
shop
in
the
country
for
you
you
will
be
welcomed
everywhere
and
when
i
doubtingly
asked
if
people
would
care
to
look
at
things
made
of
wood
he
said
made
of
wood
made
of
wood
what
does
it
matter
what
they
made
of
when
they
are
so
original
there
nothing
else
like
them
in
the
world
that
is
what
will
attract
attention
and
besides
they
mighty
handsome
things
anyway
to
come
from
the
backwoods
so
i
was
encouraged
to
leave
home
and
go
at
his
direction
to
the
state
fair
when
it
was
being
held
in
madison
viii
the
world
and
the
university
leaving
home
creating
a
sensation
in
pardeeville
a
ride
on
a
locomotive
at
the
state
fair
in
madison
employment
in
a
at
prairie
du
chien
back
to
madison
entering
the
university
teaching
school
first
lesson
in
botany
more
inventions
the
university
of
the
wilderness
when
i
told
father
that
i
was
about
to
leave
home
and
inquired
whether
if
i
should
happen
to
be
in
need
of
money
he
would
send
me
a
little
he
said
no
depend
entirely
on
yourself
good
advice
i
suppose
but
surely
needlessly
severe
for
a
bashful
boy
who
had
worked
so
hard
i
had
the
gold
sovereign
that
my
grandfather
had
given
me
when
i
left
scotland
and
a
few
dollars
perhaps
ten
that
i
had
made
by
raising
a
few
bushels
of
grain
on
a
little
patch
of
sandy
abandoned
ground
so
when
i
left
home
to
try
the
world
i
had
only
about
fifteen
dollars
in
my
pocket
strange
to
say
father
carefully
taught
us
to
consider
ourselves
very
poor
worms
of
the
dust
conceived
in
sin
and
devoutly
believed
that
quenching
every
spark
of
pride
and
was
a
sacred
duty
without
realizing
that
in
so
doing
he
might
at
the
same
time
be
quenching
everything
else
praise
he
considered
most
venomous
and
tried
to
assure
me
that
when
i
was
fairly
out
in
the
wicked
world
making
my
own
way
i
would
soon
learn
that
although
i
might
have
thought
him
a
hard
taskmaster
at
times
strangers
were
far
harder
on
the
contrary
i
found
no
lack
of
kindness
and
sympathy
all
the
baggage
i
carried
was
a
package
made
up
of
the
two
clocks
and
a
small
thermometer
made
of
a
piece
of
old
washboard
all
three
tied
together
with
no
covering
or
case
of
any
sort
the
whole
looking
like
one
very
complicated
machine
the
aching
parting
from
mother
and
my
sisters
was
of
course
hard
to
bear
father
let
david
drive
me
down
to
pardeeville
a
place
i
had
never
before
seen
though
it
was
only
nine
miles
south
of
the
hickory
hill
home
when
we
arrived
at
the
village
tavern
it
seemed
deserted
not
a
single
person
was
in
sight
i
set
my
clock
baggage
on
the
rickety
platform
david
said
and
started
for
home
leaving
me
alone
in
the
world
the
grinding
noise
made
by
the
wagon
in
turning
short
brought
out
the
landlord
and
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
was
my
strange
bundle
then
he
looked
at
me
and
said
hello
young
man
what
this
machines
i
said
for
keeping
time
and
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
so
forth
well
well
that
a
mighty
queer
you
must
be
a
yankee
where
did
you
get
the
pattern
for
such
a
thing
in
my
head
i
said
some
one
down
the
street
happened
to
notice
the
landlord
looking
intently
at
something
and
came
up
to
see
what
it
was
three
or
four
people
in
that
little
village
formed
an
attractive
crowd
and
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
greater
part
of
the
population
of
pardeeville
stood
gazing
in
a
circle
around
my
strange
hickory
belongings
i
kept
outside
of
the
circle
to
avoid
being
seen
and
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
the
remarks
without
being
embarrassed
almost
every
one
as
he
came
up
would
say
what
that
what
it
for
who
made
it
the
landlord
would
answer
them
all
alike
why
a
young
man
that
lives
out
in
the
country
somewhere
made
it
and
he
says
it
a
thing
for
keeping
time
getting
up
in
the
morning
and
something
that
i
did
understand
i
do
know
what
he
meant
oh
no
one
of
the
crowd
would
say
that
ca
be
it
for
something
else
something
mysterious
mark
my
words
you
see
all
about
it
in
the
newspapers
some
of
these
days
a
curious
little
fellow
came
running
up
the
street
joined
the
crowd
stood
on
tiptoe
to
get
sight
of
the
wonder
quickly
made
up
his
mind
and
shouted
in
crisp
confident
style
i
know
what
that
contraption
for
it
a
machine
for
taking
the
bones
out
of
fish
this
was
in
the
time
of
the
great
popular
phrenology
craze
when
the
fences
and
barns
along
the
roads
throughout
the
country
were
plastered
with
big
posters
headed
know
thyself
and
advising
everybody
to
attend
schoolhouse
lectures
to
have
their
heads
explained
and
be
told
what
they
were
good
for
and
whom
they
ought
to
marry
my
mechanical
bundle
seemed
to
bring
a
good
deal
of
this
phrenology
to
mind
for
many
of
the
onlookers
would
say
i
wish
i
could
see
that
boy
head
he
must
have
a
tremendous
bump
of
invention
others
complimented
me
by
saying
i
wish
i
had
that
fellow
head
rather
have
it
than
the
best
farm
in
the
state
i
stayed
overnight
at
this
little
tavern
waiting
for
a
train
in
the
morning
i
went
to
the
station
and
set
my
bundle
on
the
platform
along
came
the
thundering
train
a
glorious
sight
the
first
train
i
had
ever
waited
for
when
the
conductor
saw
my
queer
baggage
he
cried
hello
what
have
we
here
inventions
for
keeping
time
early
rising
and
so
forth
may
i
take
them
into
the
car
with
me
you
can
take
them
where
you
like
he
replied
but
you
had
better
give
them
to
the
if
you
take
them
into
the
car
they
will
draw
a
crowd
and
might
get
broken
so
i
gave
them
to
the
and
made
haste
to
ask
the
conductor
whether
i
might
ride
on
the
engine
he
said
yes
it
the
right
place
for
you
run
ahead
and
tell
the
engineer
what
i
say
but
the
engineer
bluntly
refused
to
let
me
on
saying
it
do
matter
what
the
conductor
told
you
say
you
ca
ride
on
my
engine
by
this
time
the
conductor
standing
ready
to
start
his
train
was
watching
to
see
what
luck
i
had
and
when
he
saw
me
returning
came
ahead
to
meet
me
the
engineer
wo
let
me
on
i
reported
wo
he
said
the
kind
conductor
oh
i
guess
he
will
you
come
down
with
me
and
so
he
actually
took
the
time
and
patience
to
walk
the
length
of
that
long
train
to
get
me
on
to
the
engine
charlie
said
he
addressing
the
engineer
do
you
ever
take
a
passenger
very
seldom
he
replied
anyhow
i
wish
you
would
take
this
young
man
on
he
has
the
strangest
machines
in
the
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
believe
he
could
make
a
locomotive
he
wants
to
see
the
engine
running
let
him
on
then
in
a
low
whisper
he
told
me
to
jump
on
which
i
did
gladly
the
engineer
offering
neither
encouragement
nor
objection
as
soon
as
the
train
was
started
the
engineer
asked
what
the
strange
thing
the
conductor
spoke
of
really
was
only
inventions
for
keeping
time
getting
folk
up
in
the
morning
and
so
forth
i
hastily
replied
and
before
he
could
ask
any
more
questions
i
asked
permission
to
go
outside
of
the
cab
to
see
the
machinery
this
he
kindly
granted
adding
be
careful
not
to
fall
off
and
when
you
hear
me
whistling
for
a
station
you
come
back
because
if
it
is
reported
against
me
to
the
superintendent
that
i
allow
boys
to
run
all
over
my
engine
i
might
lose
my
job
assuring
him
that
i
would
come
back
promptly
i
went
out
and
walked
along
the
on
the
side
of
the
boiler
watching
the
magnificent
machine
rushing
through
the
landscapes
as
if
glorying
in
its
strength
like
a
living
creature
while
seated
on
the
platform
i
seemed
to
be
fairly
flying
and
the
wonderful
display
of
power
and
motion
was
enchanting
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
been
on
a
train
much
less
a
locomotive
since
i
had
left
scotland
when
i
got
to
madison
i
thanked
the
kind
conductor
and
engineer
for
my
glorious
ride
inquired
the
way
to
the
fair
shouldered
my
inventions
and
walked
to
the
fair
ground
when
i
applied
for
an
admission
ticket
at
a
window
by
the
gate
i
told
the
agent
that
i
had
something
to
exhibit
what
is
it
he
inquired
well
here
it
is
look
at
it
when
he
craned
his
neck
through
the
window
and
got
a
glimpse
of
my
bundle
he
cried
excitedly
oh
do
need
a
ticket
come
right
in
when
i
inquired
of
the
agent
where
such
things
as
mine
should
be
exhibited
he
said
you
see
that
building
up
on
the
hill
with
a
big
flag
on
it
that
the
fine
arts
hall
and
it
just
the
place
for
your
wonderful
invention
so
i
went
up
to
the
fine
arts
hall
and
looked
in
wondering
if
they
would
allow
wooden
things
in
so
fine
a
place
i
was
met
at
the
door
by
a
dignified
gentleman
who
greeted
me
kindly
and
said
young
man
what
have
we
got
here
two
clocks
and
a
thermometer
i
replied
did
you
make
these
they
look
wonderfully
beautiful
and
novel
and
must
i
think
prove
the
most
interesting
feature
of
the
fair
where
shall
i
place
them
i
inquired
just
look
around
young
man
and
choose
the
place
you
like
best
whether
it
is
occupied
or
not
you
can
have
your
pick
of
all
the
building
and
a
carpenter
to
make
the
necessary
shelving
and
assist
you
every
way
possible
so
i
quickly
had
a
shelf
made
large
enough
for
all
of
them
went
out
on
the
hill
and
picked
up
some
glacial
boulders
of
the
right
size
for
weights
and
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
clocks
were
running
they
seemed
to
attract
more
attention
than
anything
else
in
the
hall
i
got
lots
of
praise
from
the
crowd
and
the
the
local
press
reports
were
copied
into
the
eastern
papers
it
was
considered
wonderful
that
a
boy
on
a
farm
had
been
able
to
invent
and
make
such
things
and
almost
every
spectator
foretold
good
fortune
but
i
had
been
so
lectured
by
my
father
above
all
things
to
avoid
praise
that
i
was
afraid
to
read
those
kind
newspaper
notices
and
never
clipped
out
or
preserved
any
of
them
just
glanced
at
them
and
turned
away
my
eyes
from
beholding
vanity
they
gave
me
a
prize
of
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
and
a
diploma
for
wonderful
things
not
down
in
the
list
of
exhibits
many
years
later
after
i
had
written
articles
and
books
i
received
a
letter
from
the
gentleman
who
had
charge
of
the
fine
arts
hall
he
proved
to
be
the
professor
of
english
literature
in
the
university
of
wisconsin
at
this
fair
time
and
long
afterward
he
sent
me
clippings
of
reports
of
his
lectures
he
had
a
lecture
on
me
discussing
style
etcetera
and
telling
how
well
he
remembered
my
arrival
at
the
hall
in
my
with
those
mechanical
wonders
on
my
shoulder
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
these
inventions
though
of
little
importance
opened
all
doors
for
me
and
made
marks
that
have
lasted
many
years
simply
i
suppose
because
they
were
original
and
promising
i
was
looking
around
in
the
mean
time
to
find
out
where
i
should
go
to
seek
my
fortune
an
inventor
at
the
fair
by
the
name
of
wiard
was
exhibiting
an
iceboat
he
had
invented
to
run
on
the
upper
mississippi
from
prairie
du
chien
to
paul
during
the
winter
months
explaining
how
useful
it
would
be
thus
to
make
a
highway
of
the
river
while
it
was
closed
to
ordinary
navigation
by
ice
after
he
saw
my
inventions
he
offered
me
a
place
in
his
foundry
and
in
prairie
du
chien
and
promised
to
assist
me
all
he
could
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
accept
his
offer
and
rode
with
him
to
prairie
du
chien
in
his
iceboat
which
was
mounted
on
a
flat
car
i
soon
found
however
that
he
was
seldom
at
home
and
that
i
was
not
likely
to
learn
much
at
his
small
shop
i
found
a
place
where
i
could
work
for
my
board
and
devote
my
spare
hours
to
mechanical
drawing
geometry
and
physics
making
but
little
headway
however
although
the
pelton
family
for
whom
i
worked
were
very
kind
i
made
up
my
mind
after
a
few
months
stay
in
prairie
du
chien
to
return
to
madison
hoping
that
in
some
way
i
might
be
able
to
gain
an
education
at
madison
i
raised
a
few
dollars
by
making
and
selling
a
few
of
those
bedsteads
that
set
the
sleepers
on
their
feet
in
the
morning
inserting
in
the
footboard
the
works
of
an
ordinary
clock
that
could
be
bought
for
a
dollar
i
also
made
a
few
dollars
addressing
circulars
in
an
insurance
office
while
at
the
same
time
i
was
paying
my
board
by
taking
care
of
a
pair
of
horses
and
going
errands
this
is
of
no
great
interest
except
that
i
was
thus
winning
my
bread
while
hoping
that
something
would
turn
up
that
might
enable
me
to
make
money
enough
to
enter
the
state
university
this
was
my
ambition
and
it
never
wavered
no
matter
what
i
was
doing
no
university
it
seemed
to
me
could
be
more
admirably
situated
and
as
i
sauntered
about
it
charmed
with
its
fine
lawns
and
trees
and
beautiful
lakes
and
saw
the
students
going
and
coming
with
their
books
and
occasionally
practising
with
a
theodolite
in
measuring
distances
i
thought
that
if
i
could
only
join
them
it
would
be
the
greatest
joy
of
life
i
was
desperately
hungry
and
thirsty
for
knowledge
and
willing
to
endure
anything
to
get
it
one
day
i
chanced
to
meet
a
student
who
had
noticed
my
inventions
at
the
fair
and
now
recognized
me
and
when
i
said
you
are
fortunate
fellows
to
be
allowed
to
study
in
this
beautiful
place
i
wish
i
could
join
you
well
why
do
you
he
asked
i
have
money
enough
i
said
oh
as
to
money
he
reassuringly
explained
very
little
is
required
i
presume
you
able
to
enter
the
freshman
class
and
you
can
board
yourself
as
quite
a
number
of
us
do
at
a
cost
of
about
a
dollar
a
week
the
baker
and
milkman
come
every
day
you
can
live
on
bread
and
milk
well
i
thought
maybe
i
have
money
enough
for
at
least
one
beginning
term
anyhow
i
could
help
trying
with
fear
and
trembling
overladen
with
ignorance
i
called
on
professor
stirling
the
dean
of
the
faculty
who
was
then
acting
president
presented
my
case
and
told
him
how
far
i
had
got
on
with
my
studies
at
home
and
that
i
had
been
to
school
since
leaving
scotland
at
the
age
of
eleven
years
excepting
one
short
term
of
a
couple
of
months
at
a
district
school
because
i
could
not
be
spared
from
the
farm
work
after
hearing
my
story
the
kind
professor
welcomed
me
to
the
glorious
university
next
it
seemed
to
me
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
after
a
few
weeks
in
the
preparatory
department
i
entered
the
freshman
class
in
latin
i
found
that
one
of
the
books
in
use
i
had
already
studied
in
scotland
so
after
an
interruption
of
a
dozen
years
i
began
my
latin
over
again
where
i
had
left
off
and
strange
to
say
most
of
it
came
back
to
me
especially
the
grammar
which
i
had
committed
to
memory
at
the
dunbar
grammar
school
during
the
four
years
that
i
was
in
the
university
i
earned
enough
in
the
during
the
long
summer
vacations
to
carry
me
through
the
balance
of
each
year
working
very
hard
cutting
with
a
cradle
four
acres
of
wheat
a
day
and
helping
to
put
it
in
the
shock
but
having
to
buy
books
and
paying
i
think
dollars
a
year
for
instruction
and
occasionally
buying
acids
and
retorts
glass
tubing
flasks
i
had
to
cut
down
expenses
for
board
now
and
then
to
half
a
dollar
a
week
one
winter
i
taught
school
ten
miles
south
of
madison
earning
money
at
the
rate
of
twenty
dollars
a
month
boarding
round
and
keeping
up
my
university
work
by
studying
at
night
as
i
was
not
then
well
enough
off
to
own
a
watch
i
used
one
of
my
hickory
clocks
not
only
for
keeping
time
but
for
starting
the
school
fire
in
the
cold
mornings
and
regulating
i
carried
it
out
on
my
shoulder
to
the
old
log
schoolhouse
and
set
it
to
work
on
a
little
shelf
nailed
to
one
of
the
knotty
bulging
logs
the
winter
was
very
cold
and
i
had
to
go
to
the
schoolhouse
and
start
the
fire
about
eight
to
warm
it
before
the
arrival
of
the
scholars
this
was
a
rather
trying
job
and
one
that
my
clock
might
easily
be
made
to
do
therefore
after
supper
one
evening
i
told
the
head
of
the
family
with
whom
i
was
boarding
that
if
he
would
give
me
a
candle
i
would
go
back
to
the
schoolhouse
and
make
arrangements
for
lighting
the
fire
at
eight
without
my
having
to
be
present
until
time
to
open
the
school
at
nine
he
said
oh
young
man
you
have
some
curious
things
in
the
but
i
do
think
you
can
do
that
i
said
oh
yes
it
easy
and
in
hardly
more
than
an
hour
the
simple
job
was
completed
i
had
only
to
place
a
teaspoonful
of
powdered
chlorate
of
potash
and
sugar
on
the
near
a
few
shavings
and
kindling
and
at
the
required
time
make
the
clock
through
a
simple
arrangement
touch
the
inflammable
mixture
with
a
drop
of
sulphuric
acid
every
evening
after
school
was
dismissed
i
shoveled
out
what
was
left
of
the
fire
into
the
snow
put
in
a
little
kindling
filled
up
the
big
box
stove
with
heavy
oak
wood
placed
the
lighting
arrangement
on
the
hearth
and
set
the
clock
to
drop
the
acid
at
the
hour
of
eight
all
this
requiring
only
a
few
minutes
the
first
morning
after
i
had
made
this
simple
arrangement
i
invited
the
doubting
farmer
to
watch
the
old
squat
schoolhouse
from
a
window
that
overlooked
it
to
see
if
a
good
smoke
did
not
rise
from
the
stovepipe
sure
enough
on
the
minute
he
saw
a
tall
column
curling
gracefully
up
through
the
frosty
air
but
instead
of
congratulating
me
on
my
success
he
solemnly
shook
his
head
and
said
in
a
hollow
lugubrious
voice
young
man
you
will
be
setting
fire
to
the
schoolhouse
all
winter
long
that
faithful
clock
fire
never
failed
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
schoolhouse
the
stove
was
usually
at
the
beginning
of
the
long
summer
vacations
i
returned
to
the
hickory
hill
farm
to
earn
the
means
in
the
to
continue
my
university
course
walking
all
the
way
to
save
railroad
fares
and
although
i
cradled
four
acres
of
wheat
a
day
i
made
the
long
hard
sweaty
day
work
still
longer
and
harder
by
keeping
up
my
study
of
plants
at
the
noon
hour
i
collected
a
large
handful
put
them
in
water
to
keep
them
fresh
and
after
supper
got
to
work
on
them
and
sat
up
till
after
midnight
analyzing
and
classifying
thus
leaving
only
four
hours
for
sleep
and
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
after
taking
up
botany
i
knew
the
principal
flowering
plants
of
the
region
i
received
my
first
lesson
in
botany
from
a
student
by
the
name
of
griswold
who
is
now
county
judge
of
the
county
of
waukesha
wisconsin
in
the
university
he
was
often
laughed
at
on
account
of
his
anxiety
to
instruct
others
and
his
frequently
saying
with
fine
emphasis
imparting
instruction
is
my
greatest
enjoyment
one
memorable
day
in
june
when
i
was
standing
on
the
stone
steps
of
the
north
dormitory
griswold
joined
me
and
at
once
began
to
teach
he
reached
up
plucked
a
flower
from
an
overspreading
branch
of
a
locust
tree
and
handing
it
to
me
said
muir
do
you
know
what
family
this
tree
belongs
to
no
i
said
i
do
know
anything
about
botany
well
no
matter
said
he
what
is
it
like
it
like
a
pea
flower
i
replied
that
right
you
right
he
said
it
belongs
to
the
pea
family
but
how
can
that
be
i
objected
when
the
pea
is
a
weak
clinging
straggling
herb
and
the
locust
a
big
thorny
hardwood
tree
yes
that
is
true
he
replied
as
to
the
difference
in
size
but
it
is
also
true
that
in
all
their
essential
characters
they
are
alike
and
therefore
they
must
belong
to
one
and
the
same
family
just
look
at
the
peculiar
form
of
the
locust
flower
you
see
that
the
upper
petal
called
the
banner
is
broad
and
erect
and
so
is
the
upper
petal
of
the
pea
flower
the
two
lower
petals
called
the
wings
are
outspread
and
so
are
those
of
the
pea
and
the
two
petals
below
the
wings
are
united
on
their
edges
curve
upward
and
form
what
is
called
the
keel
and
so
you
see
are
the
corresponding
petals
of
the
pea
flower
and
now
look
at
the
stamens
and
pistils
you
see
that
nine
of
the
ten
stamens
have
their
filaments
united
into
a
sheath
around
the
pistil
but
the
tenth
stamen
has
its
filament
free
these
are
very
marked
characters
are
they
not
and
strange
to
say
you
will
find
them
the
same
in
the
tree
and
in
the
vine
now
look
at
the
ovules
or
seeds
of
the
locust
and
you
will
see
that
they
are
arranged
in
a
pod
or
legume
like
those
of
the
pea
and
look
at
the
leaves
you
see
the
leaf
of
the
locust
is
made
up
of
several
leaflets
and
so
also
is
the
leaf
of
the
pea
now
taste
the
locust
leaf
i
did
so
and
found
that
it
tasted
like
the
leaf
of
the
pea
nature
has
used
the
same
seasoning
for
both
though
one
is
a
straggling
vine
the
other
a
big
tree
now
surely
you
can
not
imagine
that
all
these
similar
characters
are
mere
coincidences
do
they
not
rather
go
to
show
that
the
creator
in
making
the
pea
vine
and
locust
tree
had
the
same
idea
in
mind
and
that
plants
are
not
classified
arbitrarily
man
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
classification
nature
has
attended
to
all
that
giving
essential
unity
with
boundless
variety
so
that
the
botanist
has
only
to
examine
plants
to
learn
the
harmony
of
their
relations
this
fine
lesson
charmed
me
and
sent
me
to
the
woods
and
meadows
in
wild
enthusiasm
like
everybody
else
i
was
always
fond
of
flowers
attracted
by
their
external
beauty
and
purity
now
my
eyes
were
opened
to
their
inner
beauty
all
alike
revealing
glorious
traces
of
the
thoughts
of
god
and
leading
on
and
on
into
the
infinite
cosmos
i
wandered
away
at
every
opportunity
making
long
excursions
round
the
lakes
gathering
specimens
and
keeping
them
fresh
in
a
bucket
in
my
room
to
study
at
night
after
my
regular
class
tasks
were
learned
for
my
eyes
never
closed
on
the
plant
glory
i
had
seen
nevertheless
i
still
indulged
my
love
of
mechanical
inventions
i
invented
a
desk
in
which
the
books
i
had
to
study
were
arranged
in
order
at
the
beginning
of
each
term
i
also
made
a
bed
which
set
me
on
my
feet
every
morning
at
the
hour
determined
on
and
in
dark
winter
mornings
just
as
the
bed
set
me
on
the
floor
it
lighted
a
lamp
then
after
the
minutes
allowed
for
dressing
had
elapsed
a
click
was
heard
and
the
first
book
to
be
studied
was
pushed
up
from
a
rack
below
the
top
of
the
desk
thrown
open
and
allowed
to
remain
there
the
number
of
minutes
required
then
the
machinery
closed
the
book
and
allowed
it
to
drop
back
into
its
stall
then
moved
the
rack
forward
and
threw
up
the
next
in
order
and
so
on
all
the
day
being
divided
according
to
the
times
of
recitation
and
time
required
and
allotted
to
each
study
besides
this
i
thought
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
in
the
when
the
sun
rose
early
to
dispense
with
the
bed
machinery
and
make
use
of
sunbeams
instead
this
i
did
simply
by
taking
a
lens
out
of
my
small
fixing
it
on
a
frame
on
the
sill
of
my
bedroom
window
and
pointing
it
to
the
sunrise
the
sunbeams
focused
on
a
thread
burned
it
through
allowing
the
bed
machinery
to
put
me
on
my
feet
when
i
wished
to
arise
at
any
given
time
after
sunrise
i
had
only
to
turn
the
pivoted
frame
that
held
the
lens
the
requisite
number
of
degrees
or
minutes
thus
i
took
advice
and
hitched
my
bed
to
a
star
illustration
my
desk
made
and
used
at
the
wisconsin
state
university
i
also
invented
a
machine
to
make
visible
the
growth
of
plants
and
the
action
of
the
sunlight
a
very
delicate
contrivance
enclosed
in
glass
besides
this
i
invented
a
barometer
and
a
lot
of
novel
scientific
apparatus
my
room
was
regarded
as
a
sort
of
show
place
by
the
professors
who
oftentimes
brought
visitors
to
it
on
saturdays
and
holidays
and
when
some
eighteen
years
after
i
had
left
the
university
i
was
sauntering
over
the
campus
in
time
of
vacation
and
spoke
to
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
taking
some
charge
of
the
grounds
he
informed
me
that
he
was
the
janitor
and
when
i
inquired
what
had
become
of
pat
the
janitor
in
my
time
and
a
favorite
with
the
students
he
replied
that
pat
was
still
alive
and
well
but
now
too
old
to
do
much
work
and
when
i
pointed
to
the
dormitory
room
that
i
long
ago
occupied
he
said
oh
then
i
know
who
you
are
and
mentioned
my
name
how
comes
it
that
you
know
my
name
i
inquired
he
explained
that
pat
always
pointed
out
that
room
to
newcomers
and
told
long
stories
about
the
wonders
that
used
to
be
in
it
so
long
had
the
memory
of
my
little
inventions
survived
although
i
was
four
years
at
the
university
i
did
not
take
the
regular
course
of
studies
but
instead
picked
out
what
i
thought
would
be
most
useful
to
me
particularly
chemistry
which
opened
a
new
world
and
mathematics
and
physics
a
little
greek
and
latin
botany
and
geology
i
was
far
from
satisfied
with
what
i
had
learned
and
should
have
stayed
longer
anyhow
i
wandered
away
on
a
glorious
botanical
and
geological
excursion
which
has
lasted
nearly
fifty
years
and
is
not
yet
completed
always
happy
and
free
poor
and
rich
without
thought
of
a
diploma
or
of
making
a
name
urged
on
and
on
through
endless
inspiring
godful
beauty
from
the
top
of
a
hill
on
the
north
side
of
lake
mendota
i
gained
a
last
wistful
lingering
view
of
the
beautiful
university
grounds
and
buildings
where
i
had
spent
so
many
hungry
and
happy
and
hopeful
days
there
with
streaming
eyes
i
bade
my
blessed
alma
mater
farewell
but
i
was
