the
princess
de
montpensier
by

de
lafayette
introduction
by
oliver
colt
this
story
was
written
by
madame
de
lafayette
and
published
anonymously
in
it
is
set
in
a
period
almost
years
previously
during
the
sanguinary
wars
of
the
when
the
catholic
rulers
of
europe
with
the
encouragement
of
the
papacy
were
bent
on
extirpating
the
followers
of
the
creeds
of
luther
and
calvin
i
am
not
qualified
to
embark
on
a
historical
analysis
and
shall
do
no
more
than
say
that
many
of
the
persons
who
are
involved
in
the
tale
actually
existed
and
the
events
referred
to
actually
took
place
the
weak
and
vicious
king
and
his
malign
and
unscrupulous
mother
are
real
enough
as
is
a
duc
de
montpensier
a
prince
of
the
blood
who
achieved
some
notoriety
for
the
cruelty
with
which
he
treated
any
huguenots
who
fell
into
his
hands
and
for
the
leadership
he
gave
to
the
assassins
during
the
atrocious
massacre
of
bartholomew
day
he
was
married
and
had
progeny
but
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
married
was
not
the
heroine
of
this
romance
who
is
a
fictional
character
as
is
the
comte
de
chabannes
the
duc
de
guise
of
the
period
whose
father
had
been
killed
fighting
against
the
protestants
did
marry
the
princess
de
portein
but
this
was
for
political
reasons
and
not
to
satisfy
the
wishes
of
a
princess
de
montpensier
it
will
be
noticed
i
think
that
women
were
traded
in
marriage
with
little
or
no
regard
to
their
personal
emotions
and
no
doubt
as
has
been
remarked
by
others
marriages
without
love
encouraged
love
outside
marriage
whatever
the
reality
the
literary
conventions
of
the
time
seem
to
have
dictated
that
we
should
be
treated
only
to
ardent
glances
fervent
declarations
swoonings
and
courtly
gestures
we
are
not
led
even
to
the
bedroom
door
let
alone
the
amorous
couch
i
wonder
however
if
the
reader
might
not
think
that
this
little
tale
written
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
contains
the
elements
of
many
of
the
romantic
novels
and
soap
operas
which
have
followed
it
at
one
level
it
is
a
cautionary
tale
about
the
consequences
of
marital
infidelity
at
another
it
is
a
story
of
a
woman
betrayed
treated
as
a
pretty
bauble
for
the
gratification
of
men
and
cast
aside
when
she
has
served
her
purpose
or
a
butterfly
trapped
in
a
net
woven
by
uncaring
fate
her
end
is
rather
too
contrived
for
modern
taste
but
even
today
characters
who
are
about
to
be
written
out
of
the
plot
in
soap
operas
are
sometimes
smitten
by
mysterious
and
fatal
disorders
of
the
brain
the
unfortunate
comte
de
chabannes
is
the
archetypical
decent
chap
the
faithful
but
rejected
swain
who
sacrifices
himself
for
the
welfare
of
his
beloved
without
expectation
of
reward
in
the
hands
of
another
writer
with
some
modification
he
could
have
provided
a
happy
ending
in
the
mills
and
boon
tradition
this
translation
is
not
a
schoolroom
exercise
for
although
i
have
not
altered
the
story
i
have
altered
the
exact
way
in
which
it
is
told
in
the
original
with
the
aim
of
making
it
more
acceptable
to
the
modern
reader
all
translation
must
involve
paraphrase
for
what
sounds
well
in
one
language
may
sound
ridiculous
if
translated
literally
into
another
and
it
is
for
the
translator
to
decide
how
far
this
process
may
be
carried
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
my
task
only
the
reader
can
say
the
princess
de
montpensier
by
madame
de
lafayette
translated
by
oliver
colt
mézières
it
was
while
the
civil
war
of
religion
was
tearing
france
apart
that
the
only
daughter
of
the
marquis
of
mézières
a
very
considerable
heiress
both
because
of
her
wealth
and
the
illustrious
house
of
anjou
from
which
she
was
descended
was
promised
in
marriage
to
the
duc
de
maine
the
younger
brother
of
the
duc
de
guise
the
marriage
was
delayed
because
of
the
youth
of
this
heiress
but
the
elder
of
the
brothers
the
duc
de
guise
who
saw
much
of
her
and
who
saw
also
the
burgeoning
of
what
was
to
become
a
great
beauty
fell
in
love
with
her
and
was
loved
in
return
they
concealed
their
feelings
with
great
care
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
not
yet
become
as
ambitious
as
he
was
to
become
later
wanted
desperately
to
marry
her
but
fear
of
angering
his
uncle
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
who
had
taken
the
place
of
his
dead
father
prevented
him
from
making
any
declaration
this
was
how
the
matter
stood
when
the
ruling
house
of
bourbon
who
could
not
bear
to
see
any
benefit
accruing
to
that
of
de
guise
decided
to
step
in
and
reap
the
profit
themselves
by
marrying
this
heiress
to
the
prince
de
montpensier
this
project
was
pursued
with
such
vigour
that
the
parents
of
mlle
de
mézières
despite
the
promises
given
to
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
resolved
to
give
her
in
marriage
to
the
young
prince
the
house
of
de
guise
was
much
displeased
at
this
but
the
duc
himself
was
overcome
by
grief
and
regarded
this
as
an
insupportable
affront
in
spite
of
warnings
from
his
uncles
the
cardinal
and
the
duc
de
aumale
who
did
not
wish
to
stand
in
the
way
of
something
which
they
could
not
prevent
he
expressed
himself
with
so
much
violence
even
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
de
montpensier
that
a
mutual
enmity
arose
between
them
which
lasted
all
their
lives
mlle
de
mézières
urged
by
her
parents
to
marry
the
prince
realised
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
marry
the
duc
de
guise
and
that
if
she
married
his
brother
the
duc
de
maine
she
would
be
in
the
dangerous
position
of
having
as
a
a
man
whom
she
wished
was
her
husband
so
she
agreed
finally
to
marry
the
prince
and
begged
the
duc
de
guise
not
to
continue
to
place
any
obstacle
in
the
way
the
marriage
having
taken
place
the
prince
de
montpensier
took
her
off
to
his
estate
of
champigny
which
was
where
princes
of
his
family
usually
lived
in
order
to
remove
her
from
paris
where
it
seemed
that
an
outbreak
of
fighting
was
imminent
this
great
city
being
under
threat
of
siege
by
a
huguenot
army
led
by
the
prince
de
condé
who
had
once
more
declared
war
on
the
king
the
prince
de
montpensier
had
when
a
very
young
man
formed
a
close
friendship
with
the
comte
de
chabannes
a
man
considerably
older
than
himself
and
of
exemplary
character
the
comte
in
turn
had
been
so
much
influenced
by
the
esteem
and
friendship
of
the
prince
that
he
had
broken
off
influential
connections
which
he
had
with
the
prince
de
condé
and
had
declared
for
the
catholics
a
change
of
sides
which
having
no
other
foundation
was
regarded
with
suspicion
so
much
so
that
the
queen
mother
catherine
de
medici
on
the
declaration
of
war
by
the
huguenots
proposed
to
have
him
imprisoned
the
prince
de
montpensier
prevented
this
and
carried
him
away
to
champigny
when
he
went
there
with
his
wife
the
comte
being
a
very
pleasant
amiable
man
soon
gained
the
approbation
of
the
princess
and
before
long
she
regarded
him
with
as
much
friendship
and
confidence
as
did
her
husband
chabannes
for
his
part
observed
with
admiration
the
beauty
sense
and
modesty
of
the
young
princess
and
used
what
influence
he
had
to
instill
in
her
thoughts
and
behaviour
suited
to
her
elevated
position
so
that
under
his
guidance
she
became
one
of
the
most
accomplished
women
of
her
time
the
prince
having
gone
back
to
the
court
where
he
was
needed
owing
to
the
continuation
of
the
war
the
comte
lived
alone
with
the
princess
and
continued
to
treat
her
with
the
respect
due
to
her
rank
and
position
the
princess
took
him
so
far
into
her
confidence
as
to
tell
him
of
the
feelings
she
had
once
had
for
the
duc
de
guise
but
she
intimated
that
there
remained
only
enough
of
this
emotion
to
prevent
her
heart
from
straying
elsewhere
and
that
this
remnant
together
with
her
wifely
virtue
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
respond
except
with
a
rebuff
to
any
possible
suitor
the
comte
who
recognised
her
sincerity
and
who
saw
in
her
a
character
wholly
opposed
to
flirtation
and
gallantry
did
not
doubt
the
truth
of
her
words
but
nevertheless
he
was
unable
to
resist
all
the
charms
which
he
saw
daily
so
close
to
him
he
fell
deeply
in
love
with
the
princess
in
spite
of
the
shame
he
felt
at
allowing
himself
to
be
overcome
by
this
illicit
passion
however
although
not
master
of
his
heart
he
was
master
of
his
actions
the
change
in
his
emotions
did
not
show
at
all
in
his
behaviour
and
no
one
suspected
him
he
took
for
a
whole
year
scrupulous
care
to
hide
his
feelings
from
the
princess
and
believed
that
he
would
always
be
able
to
do
so
love
however
had
the
same
effect
on
him
as
it
does
on
everyone
he
longed
to
speak
of
it
and
after
all
the
struggles
which
are
usually
made
on
such
occasions
he
dared
to
tell
her
of
his
devotion
he
had
been
prepared
to
weather
the
storm
of
reproach
which
this
might
arouse
but
he
was
greeted
with
a
calm
and
a
coolness
which
was
a
thousand
times
worse
than
the
outburst
which
he
had
expected
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
be
angry
she
pointed
out
in
a
few
words
the
difference
in
their
rank
and
ages
she
reminded
him
of
what
she
had
previously
said
about
her
attitude
to
suitors
and
above
all
to
the
duty
he
owed
to
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
the
prince
her
husband
the
comte
was
overwhelmed
by
shame
and
distress
she
tried
to
console
him
by
assuring
him
that
she
would
forget
entirely
what
he
had
just
said
to
her
and
would
always
look
on
him
as
her
best
friend
assurances
which
were
small
consolation
to
the
comte
as
one
might
imagine
he
felt
the
disdain
which
was
implicit
in
all
that
the
princess
had
said
and
seeing
her
the
next
day
with
her
customary
untroubled
looks
redoubled
his
misery
the
princess
continued
to
show
him
the
same
goodwill
as
before
and
even
discussed
her
former
attachment
to
the
duc
de
guise
saying
that
she
was
pleased
that
his
increasing
fame
showed
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
affection
she
had
once
had
for
him
these
demonstrations
of
confidence
which
were
once
so
dear
to
the
comte
he
now
found
insupportable
but
he
did
not
dare
say
as
much
to
the
princess
though
he
did
sometimes
remind
her
of
what
he
had
so
rashly
confessed
to
her
after
an
absence
of
two
years
peace
having
been
declared
the
prince
de
montpensier
returned
to
his
wife
his
renown
enhanced
by
his
behaviour
at
the
siege
of
paris
and
the
battle
of
denis
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
beauty
of
the
princess
blooming
in
such
perfection
and
being
of
a
naturally
jealous
disposition
he
was
a
little
put
out
of
humour
by
the
realisation
that
this
beauty
would
be
evident
to
others
beside
himself
he
was
delighted
to
see
once
more
the
comte
for
whom
his
affection
was
in
no
way
diminished
he
asked
him
for
confidential
details
about
his
wife
character
and
temperament
for
she
was
almost
a
stranger
to
him
because
of
the
little
time
during
which
they
had
lived
together
the
comte
with
the
utmost
sincerity
as
if
he
himself
were
not
enamoured
told
the
prince
everything
he
knew
about
the
princess
which
would
encourage
her
husband
love
of
her
and
he
also
suggested
to
madame
de
montpensier
all
the
measures
she
might
take
to
win
the
heart
and
respect
of
her
spouse
the
comte
devotion
led
him
to
think
of
nothing
but
what
would
increase
the
happiness
and
of
the
princess
and
to
forget
without
difficulty
the
interest
which
lovers
usually
have
in
stirring
up
trouble
between
the
objects
of
their
affection
and
their
marital
partners
the
peace
was
only
war
soon
broke
out
again
by
reason
of
a
plot
by
the
king
to
arrest
the
prince
de
condé
and
admiral
chatillon
at
noyers
as
a
result
of
the
military
preparations
the
prince
de
montpensier
was
forced
to
leave
his
wife
and
report
for
duty
chabannes
who
had
been
restored
to
the
queen
favour
went
with
him
it
was
not
without
much
sorrow
that
he
left
the
princess
while
she
for
her
part
was
distressed
to
think
of
the
perils
to
which
the
war
might
expose
her
husband
the
leaders
of
the
huguenots
retired
to
la
rochelle
they
held
poitou
and
saintongne
the
war
flared
up
again
and
the
king
assembled
all
his
troops
his
brother
the
duc
who
later
became
henri
iii
distinguished
himself
by
his
deeds
in
various
actions
amongst
others
the
battle
of
jarnac
in
which
the
prince
de
condé
was
killed
it
was
during
this
fighting
that
the
duc
de
guise
began
to
play
a
more
important
part
and
to
display
some
of
the
great
qualities
which
had
been
expected
of
him
the
prince
de
montpensier
who
hated
him
not
only
as
a
personal
enemy
but
as
an
enemy
of
his
family
the
bourbons
took
no
pleasure
in
his
successes
nor
in
the
friendliness
shown
toward
him
by
the
duc
after
the
two
armies
had
tired
themselves
out
in
a
series
of
minor
actions
by
common
consent
they
were
stood
down
for
a
time
the
duc
stayed
at
loches
to
restore
to
order
all
the
places
which
had
been
attacked
the
duc
de
guise
stayed
with
him
and
the
prince
de
montpensier
accompanied
by
the
comte
de
chabannes
went
back
to
champigny
which
was
not
far
away
the
duc
frequently
went
to
inspect
places
where
fortifications
were
being
constructed
one
day
when
he
was
returning
to
loches
by
a
route
which
his
staff
did
not
know
well
the
duc
de
guise
who
claimed
to
know
the
way
went
to
the
head
of
the
party
to
act
as
guide
but
after
a
time
he
became
lost
and
arrived
at
the
bank
of
a
small
river
which
he
did
not
recognise
the
duc
had
a
few
words
to
say
to
him
for
leading
them
astray
but
while
they
were
held
up
there
they
saw
a
little
boat
floating
on
the
river
in
which
the
river
not
being
very
wide
they
could
see
the
figures
of
three
or
four
women
one
of
whom
very
pretty
and
sumptuously
dressed
was
watching
with
interest
the
activities
of
two
men
who
were
fishing
nearby
this
spectacle
created
something
of
a
sensation
amongst
the
princes
and
their
suite
it
seemed
to
them
like
an
episode
from
a
romance
some
declared
that
it
was
fate
that
had
led
the
duc
de
guise
to
bring
them
there
to
see
this
lovely
lady
and
that
they
should
now
pay
court
to
her
the
duc
maintained
that
it
was
he
who
should
be
her
suitor
to
push
the
matter
a
bit
further
they
made
one
of
the
horsemen
go
into
the
river
as
far
as
he
could
and
shout
to
the
lady
that
it
was
the
duc
who
wished
to
cross
to
the
other
bank
and
who
begged
the
lady
to
take
him
in
her
boat
the
lady
who
was
of
course
the
princess
de
montpensier
hearing
that
it
was
the
duc
and
having
no
doubt
when
she
saw
the
size
of
his
suite
that
it
was
indeed
him
took
her
boat
over
to
the
bank
where
he
was
his
fine
figure
made
him
easily
distinguishable
from
the
others
she
however
distinguished
even
more
easily
the
figure
of
the
duc
de
guise
this
sight
disturbed
her
and
caused
her
to
blush
a
little
which
made
her
seem
to
the
princes
to
have
an
almost
supernatural
beauty
the
duc
de
guise
recognised
her
immediately
in
spite
of
the
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
her
appearance
in
the
three
years
since
he
had
last
seen
her
he
told
the
duc
who
she
was
and
the
duc
was
at
first
embarrassed
at
the
liberty
he
had
taken
but
then
struck
by
the
princess
beauty
he
decided
to
venture
a
little
further
and
after
a
thousand
excuses
and
a
thousand
compliments
he
invented
a
serious
matter
which
required
his
presence
on
the
opposite
bank
and
accepted
the
offer
which
she
made
of
a
passage
in
her
boat
he
got
in
accompanied
only
by
the
duc
de
guise
giving
orders
to
his
suite
to
cross
the
river
elsewhere
and
to
join
him
at
champigny
which
madame
de
montpensier
told
him
was
not
more
than
two
leagues
from
there
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
boat
the
duc
asked
to
what
they
owed
this
so
pleasant
encounter
madame
de
montpensier
replied
that
having
left
champigny
with
the
prince
her
husband
with
the
intention
of
following
the
hunt
she
had
become
tired
and
having
reached
the
river
bank
she
had
gone
out
in
the
boat
to
watch
the
landing
of
a
salmon
which
had
been
caught
in
a
net
the
duc
de
guise
did
not
take
part
in
this
conversation
but
he
was
conscious
of
the
of
all
the
emotions
which
the
princess
had
once
aroused
in
him
and
thought
to
himself
that
he
would
have
difficulty
in
escaping
from
this
meeting
without
falling
once
more
under
her
spell
they
arrived
shortly
at
the
bank
where
they
found
the
princess
horses
and
her
attendants
who
had
been
waiting
for
her
the
two
noblemen
helped
her
onto
her
horse
where
she
sat
with
the
greatest
elegance
during
their
journey
back
to
champigny
they
talked
agreeably
about
a
number
of
subjects
and
her
companions
were
no
less
charmed
by
her
conversation
than
they
had
been
by
her
beauty
they
offered
her
a
number
of
compliments
to
which
she
replied
with
becoming
modesty
but
a
little
more
coolly
to
those
from
de
guise
for
she
wished
to
maintain
a
distance
which
would
prevent
him
from
founding
any
expectations
on
the
feelings
she
had
once
had
towards
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
outer
courtyard
of
champigny
they
encountered
the
prince
de
montpensier
who
had
just
returned
from
the
hunt
he
was
greatly
astonished
to
see
two
men
in
the
company
of
his
wife
and
he
was
even
more
astonished
when
on
coming
closer
he
saw
that
these
were
the
duc
and
the
duc
de
guise
the
hatred
which
he
bore
for
the
latter
combined
with
his
naturally
jealous
disposition
made
him
find
the
sight
of
these
two
princes
with
his
wife
without
knowing
how
they
came
to
be
there
or
why
they
had
come
to
his
house
so
disagreeable
that
he
was
unable
to
conceal
his
annoyance
he
however
adroitly
put
this
down
to
a
fear
that
he
could
not
receive
so
mighty
a
prince
as
the
king
brother
in
a
style
befitting
his
rank
the
comte
de
chabannes
was
even
more
upset
at
seeing
the
duc
de
guise
and
madame
de
montpensier
together
than
was
her
husband
it
seemed
to
him
a
most
evil
chance
which
had
brought
the
two
of
them
together
again
an
augury
which
foretold
disturbing
sequels
to
follow
this
new
beginning
in
the
evening
madame
de
montpensier
acted
as
hostess
with
the
same
grace
with
which
she
did
everything
in
fact
she
pleased
her
guests
a
little
too
much
the
duc
who
was
very
handsome
and
very
much
a
ladies
man
could
not
see
a
prize
so
much
worth
winning
without
wishing
ardently
to
make
it
his
own
he
had
a
touch
of
the
same
sickness
as
the
duc
de
guise
and
continuing
to
invent
important
reasons
he
stayed
for
two
days
at
champigny
without
being
obliged
to
do
so
by
anything
but
the
charms
of
madame
de
montpensier
for
her
husband
did
not
make
any
noticeable
effort
to
detain
him
the
duc
de
guise
did
not
leave
without
making
it
clear
to
madame
de
momtpensier
that
he
felt
towards
her
as
he
had
done
in
the
past
as
nobody
knew
of
this
former
relationship
he
said
to
her
several
times
in
front
of
everybody
that
his
affections
were
in
no
way
changed
a
remark
which
only
she
understood
both
he
and
the
duc
left
champigny
with
regret
for
a
long
time
they
went
along
in
silence
but
at
last
it
occurred
to
the
duc
that
the
reflections
which
occupied
his
thoughts
might
be
echoed
in
the
mind
of
the
duc
de
guise
and
he
asked
him
brusquely
if
he
was
thinking
about
the
beauties
of
madame
de
montpensier
this
blunt
question
combined
with
what
he
had
already
observed
of
the
prince
behaviour
made
the
duc
realise
that
he
had
a
rival
from
whom
it
was
essential
that
his
own
love
for
the
princess
should
be
concealed
in
order
to
allay
all
suspicion
he
answered
with
a
laugh
that
the
prince
himself
had
seemed
so
preoccupied
with
the
thoughts
which
he
was
accused
of
having
that
he
had
deemed
it
inadvisable
to
interrupt
him
the
beauty
of
madame
de
montpensier
was
he
said
nothing
new
to
him
he
had
been
used
to
discounting
its
effect
since
the
days
when
she
was
destined
to
be
his
but
he
saw
that
not
everyone
was
so
little
dazzled
the
duc
admitted
that
he
had
never
seen
anyone
to
compare
with
this
young
princess
and
that
he
was
well
aware
that
the
vision
might
be
dangerous
if
he
was
exposed
to
it
too
often
he
tried
to
get
the
duc
de
guise
to
confess
that
he
felt
the
same
but
the
duc
would
admit
to
nothing
on
their
return
to
loches
they
often
recalled
with
pleasure
the
events
which
had
led
to
their
meeting
with
the
princess
de
montpensier
a
subject
which
did
not
give
rise
to
the
same
pleasure
at
champigny
the
prince
de
montpensier
was
dissatisfied
with
all
that
had
happened
without
being
able
to
say
precisely
why
he
found
fault
with
his
wife
for
being
in
the
boat
he
considered
that
she
had
welcomed
the
princes
too
readily
and
what
displeased
him
most
was
that
he
had
noticed
the
attention
paid
to
her
by
the
duc
de
guise
this
had
provoked
in
him
a
furious
bout
of
jealousy
in
which
he
recalled
the
anger
displayed
by
the
duc
at
the
prospect
of
his
marriage
which
caused
him
to
suspect
that
even
at
that
time
the
duc
was
in
love
with
his
wife
the
comte
de
chabannes
as
usual
made
every
effort
to
act
as
peacemaker
hoping
in
this
way
to
show
the
princess
that
his
devotion
to
her
was
sincere
and
disinterested
he
could
not
resist
asking
her
what
effect
the
sight
of
the
duc
de
guise
had
produced
she
replied
that
she
had
been
somewhat
upset
and
embarrassed
at
the
memory
of
the
feelings
she
had
once
displayed
to
him
she
found
him
more
handsome
than
he
had
been
then
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
he
wished
to
persuade
her
that
he
still
loved
her
but
she
assured
the
comte
that
nothing
would
shake
her
determination
not
to
become
involved
in
any
intrigue
the
comte
was
happy
to
hear
of
this
resolve
but
he
was
far
from
being
sure
about
the
duc
de
guise
he
earnestly
warned
the
princess
of
the
danger
of
a
return
to
the
previous
situation
should
she
have
any
change
of
heart
though
when
he
spoke
of
his
devotion
she
adopted
her
invariable
attitude
of
looking
on
him
as
her
closest
friend
but
in
no
way
a
possible
suitor
the
armies
were
once
more
called
up
all
the
princes
returned
to
their
posts
and
the
prince
de
montpensier
decided
that
his
wife
should
come
with
him
to
paris
so
as
to
be
further
from
the
area
where
it
was
expected
that
fighting
would
take
place
the
huguenots
besieged
poitiers
the
duc
de
guise
went
there
to
organise
the
defence
and
while
there
enhanced
his
reputation
by
his
conduct
the
duc
suffered
from
some
illness
and
left
the
army
either
on
account
of
the
severity
of
this
or
because
he
wanted
to
return
to
the
comfort
and
security
of
paris
where
the
presence
of
the
princess
de
montpensier
was
not
the
least
of
the
attractions
the
command
of
the
army
was
taken
over
by
the
prince
de
montpensier
and
shortly
after
this
a
peace
having
been
arranged
the
court
assembled
in
paris
here
the
beauty
of
the
princess
eclipsed
that
of
all
her
rivals
she
charmed
everyone
by
her
looks
and
personality
the
duc
did
not
abandon
the
sentiments
she
had
inspired
in
him
at
champigny
he
took
great
care
to
make
her
aware
of
this
by
all
sorts
of
delicate
considerations
being
careful
at
the
same
time
not
to
make
his
attentions
too
obvious
for
fear
of
arousing
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
the
duc
de
guise
was
now
fervently
in
love
with
her
but
wishing
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
keep
this
secret
he
resolved
to
tell
her
so
privately
and
avoid
any
preliminaries
which
as
always
would
give
rise
to
talk
and
exposure
one
day
when
he
was
in
the
queen
apartments
where
there
were
very
few
people
the
queen
having
left
to
discuss
affairs
of
state
with
cardinal
de
lorraine
the
princess
de
montpensier
arrived
he
decided
to
take
this
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
and
going
up
to
her
he
said
although
it
may
surprise
and
displease
you
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
have
always
felt
for
you
that
emotion
which
you
once
knew
so
well
and
that
its
power
has
been
so
greatly
increased
by
seeing
you
again
that
neither
your
disapproval
the
hatred
of
your
husband
nor
the
rivalry
of
the
first
prince
in
the
kingdom
can
in
the
least
diminish
it
it
would
perhaps
have
been
more
tactful
to
have
let
you
become
aware
of
this
by
my
behaviour
rather
than
by
my
words
but
my
behaviour
would
have
been
evident
to
others
as
well
as
to
yourself
and
i
wanted
you
alone
to
know
of
my
love
for
you
the
princess
was
so
surprised
and
thrown
into
confusion
by
this
speech
that
she
could
not
think
of
an
answer
then
just
when
she
had
collected
her
wits
and
begun
to
reply
the
prince
de
montpensier
entered
the
room
the
princess
face
displayed
her
agitation
and
her
embarrassment
was
compounded
by
the
sight
of
her
husband
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
left
in
no
doubt
about
what
the
duc
de
guise
had
been
saying
to
her
fortunately
at
that
moment
the
queen
the
room
and
the
duc
de
guise
moved
away
to
avoid
the
jealous
prince
that
evening
the
princess
found
her
husband
in
the
worst
temper
imaginable
he
berated
her
with
the
utmost
violence
and
forbade
her
ever
to
speak
to
the
duc
de
guise
again
she
retired
to
her
room
very
sad
and
much
preoccupied
with
the
events
of
the
day
she
saw
the
duc
the
next
day
amid
the
company
around
the
queen
but
he
did
not
come
near
her
and
left
soon
after
she
did
indicating
that
he
had
no
interest
in
remaining
if
she
was
not
there
not
a
day
passed
without
her
receiving
a
thousand
covert
marks
of
the
duc
passion
though
he
did
not
attempt
to
speak
to
her
unless
he
was
sure
that
they
could
be
seen
by
nobody
convinced
of
the
duc
sincerity
the
princess
in
spite
of
the
resolution
she
had
made
at
champigny
began
to
feel
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
something
of
what
she
had
felt
in
the
past
the
duc
for
his
part
omitted
nothing
which
could
demonstrate
his
devotion
in
all
the
places
where
he
could
meet
her
in
the
queen
his
mother
apartments
he
followed
her
about
continually
completely
ignoring
his
sister
who
was
very
fond
of
him
it
was
at
around
this
time
that
it
became
evident
that
this
sister
who
later
became
the
queen
of
navarre
had
a
liking
for
the
duc
de
guise
and
another
thing
that
became
evident
was
a
cooling
of
the
friendship
between
that
duc
and
the
duc
the
rumour
linking
the
name
of
the
royal
princess
with
that
of
the
duc
de
guise
disturbed
the
princess
de
montpensier
to
a
degree
which
surprised
her
and
made
her
realise
that
she
was
more
interested
in
the
duc
than
she
had
supposed
now
it
so
happened
that
her
de
montpensier
married
a
sister
of
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
princess
was
bound
to
meet
the
duc
frequently
in
the
various
places
where
the
marriage
celebrations
required
their
presence
she
was
greatly
offended
that
a
man
who
was
widely
believed
to
be
in
love
with
madame
the
king
sister
should
dare
to
make
advances
to
her
she
was
not
only
offended
but
distressed
at
having
deceived
herself
one
day
when
they
met
at
his
sister
house
being
a
little
separated
from
the
rest
the
duc
was
tempted
to
speak
to
her
but
she
interrupted
him
sharply
saying
angrily
i
do
not
understand
how
on
the
basis
of
a
weakness
which
one
had
at
the
age
of
thirteen
you
have
the
audacity
to
make
amorous
proposals
to
a
person
like
me
particularly
when
in
the
view
of
the
whole
court
you
are
interested
in
someone
else
the
duc
who
was
intelligent
as
well
as
being
much
in
love
understood
the
emotion
which
underlay
the
princess
words
he
answered
her
most
respectfully
i
confess
madame
that
it
was
wrong
of
me
not
to
reject
the
possible
honour
of
becoming
the
king
rather
than
allow
you
to
suspect
for
a
moment
that
i
could
desire
any
heart
but
yours
but
if
you
will
be
patient
enough
to
hear
me
i
am
sure
i
can
fully
justify
my
behaviour
the
princess
made
no
reply
but
she
did
not
go
away
and
the
duc
seeing
that
she
was
prepared
to
listen
to
him
told
her
that
although
he
had
made
no
effort
to
attract
the
attention
of
madame
she
had
nevertheless
honoured
him
with
her
interest
as
he
was
not
enamoured
of
her
he
had
responded
very
coolly
to
this
honour
until
she
gave
him
to
believe
that
she
might
marry
him
the
realisation
of
the
grandeur
to
which
such
a
marriage
would
raise
him
had
obliged
him
to
take
a
little
more
trouble
this
situation
had
aroused
the
suspicions
of
the
king
and
the
duc
but
the
opposition
of
neither
of
them
would
have
any
effect
on
his
course
of
action
however
if
this
displeased
her
he
would
abandon
all
such
notions
and
never
think
of
them
again
this
sacrifice
which
the
duc
was
prepared
to
make
caused
the
princess
to
forget
all
the
anger
she
had
shown
she
changed
the
subject
and
began
to
speak
of
the
indiscretion
displayed
by
madame
in
making
the
first
advances
and
of
the
considerable
advantages
which
he
would
gain
if
he
married
her
in
the
end
without
saying
anything
kind
to
the
duc
de
guise
she
made
him
recall
a
thousand
things
he
had
found
so
pleasing
in
mlle
de
mézières
although
they
had
not
had
private
conversation
for
a
long
time
they
found
themselves
attuned
to
one
another
and
their
thoughts
went
along
a
track
which
they
both
had
travelled
in
the
past
at
the
end
of
this
agreeable
meeting
the
duc
was
left
in
a
state
of
considerable
happiness
and
the
princess
was
not
a
little
moved
to
think
that
he
truly
loved
her
however
in
the
privacy
of
her
room
she
became
ashamed
of
the
ease
with
which
she
had
accepted
the
duc
excuses
and
reflected
on
the
trouble
into
which
she
might
be
plunged
if
she
engaged
in
something
she
had
always
regarded
with
distaste
and
on
the
frightening
misery
which
a
jealous
husband
might
inflict
on
her
these
thoughts
made
her
adopt
new
resolves
but
they
disappeared
the
next
day
on
the
sight
of
the
duc
de
guise
the
new
alliance
between
their
families
gave
the
duc
many
opportunities
to
speak
to
her
he
gave
her
an
exact
account
of
all
that
passed
between
madame
and
himself
he
had
difficulty
in
allaying
the
jealousy
to
which
the
beauty
of
madame
gave
rise
and
any
number
of
promises
failed
to
reassure
her
this
jealousy
enabled
the
princess
to
defend
the
remains
of
her
heart
against
the
advances
of
the
duc
who
already
had
won
the
greater
part
of
it
the
marriage
of
the
king
to
the
daughter
of
the
emperor
maximilian
filled
the
court
with
fêtes
and
celebrations
the
king
put
on
a
ballet
in
which
madame
and
all
the
princesses
were
to
dance
among
them
only
the
princess
de
montpensier
could
rival
madame
in
beauty
the
duc
and
four
others
were
to
make
an
appearance
as
moors
their
costumes
would
all
be
identical
as
was
usual
in
this
sort
of
performance
on
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
ballet
was
presented
the
duc
de
guise
before
the
dance
began
and
before
he
had
donned
his
mask
said
a
few
words
to
the
princess
as
he
went
past
her
she
saw
clearly
that
the
prince
her
husband
had
noticed
this
which
made
her
feel
uneasy
a
little
later
seeing
the
duc
in
his
mask
and
moorish
costume
who
was
coming
to
speak
to
her
she
mistook
him
for
the
duc
de
guise
and
said
to
him
do
not
have
eyes
for
anyone
but
madame
this
evening
i
shall
not
be
in
the
least
jealous
i
am
ordering
you
i
am
being
watched
do
not
come
near
me
again
as
soon
as
she
had
said
this
she
moved
away
the
duc
stood
there
thunderstruck
he
saw
that
he
had
a
successful
rival
the
reference
to
madame
made
it
obvious
that
this
was
the
duc
de
guise
and
left
him
in
no
doubt
that
his
sister
was
to
play
second
fiddle
to
the
princess
de
montpensier
jealousy
frustration
and
rage
joining
to
the
dislike
which
he
already
had
for
the
duc
roused
him
to
a
violent
fury
and
he
would
have
given
there
and
then
some
bloody
mark
of
his
temper
had
not
that
dissimulation
which
came
naturally
to
him
prevented
him
from
attacking
the
duc
de
guise
in
the
present
circumstances
he
did
not
however
refrain
from
the
pleasure
of
disclosing
his
knowledge
of
this
secret
affair
he
approached
the
duc
de
guise
as
they
left
the
salon
where
they
had
been
dancing
and
said
to
him
to
presume
to
raise
your
eyes
towards
my
sister
as
well
as
stealing
the
affection
of
the
woman
i
love
is
altogether
too
much
the
presence
of
the
king
prevents
me
from
taking
any
action
just
now
but
remember
that
the
loss
of
your
life
may
be
one
day
the
least
thing
with
which
i
shall
punish
your
impertinence
the
pride
of
the
duc
de
guise
was
not
accustomed
to
submit
tamely
to
such
threats
but
he
was
unable
to
reply
because
at
that
moment
the
king
called
both
of
them
to
his
side
he
did
not
forget
however
and
tried
all
his
life
to
exact
revenge
from
that
evening
the
duc
endeavoured
in
all
sorts
of
ways
to
turn
the
king
against
the
duc
de
guise
he
persuaded
the
king
that
madame
would
never
agree
to
her
proposed
marriage
to
the
king
of
navarre
as
long
as
the
duc
de
guise
was
allowed
to
have
any
contact
with
her
and
that
it
was
unacceptable
that
a
subject
for
his
own
vain
purposes
should
place
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
what
could
bring
peace
to
france
the
king
already
disliked
the
duc
de
guise
and
this
speech
inflamed
his
dislike
so
much
that
the
next
day
when
the
duc
presented
himself
to
join
the
ball
at
the
queen
apartments
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
asked
him
brusquely
where
he
was
going
the
duc
without
showing
any
surprise
answered
that
he
had
come
to
offer
his
most
humble
services
to
which
the
king
replied
that
he
had
no
need
of
any
services
which
the
duc
might
provide
and
turned
away
without
any
other
acknowledgement
the
duc
was
not
deterred
from
entering
the
room
his
feelings
incensed
both
against
the
king
and
the
duc
his
natural
pride
led
him
as
an
act
of
defiance
to
pay
more
attention
to
madame
than
usual
and
what
the
duc
had
told
him
prevented
him
from
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
princess
de
montpensier
the
duc
watched
both
of
them
with
close
attention
the
princess
expression
in
spite
of
herself
showed
some
chagrin
when
the
duc
de
guise
spoke
with
madame
the
duc
who
realised
from
what
she
had
said
to
him
when
she
mistook
him
for
the
duc
de
guise
that
she
was
jealous
hoped
to
cause
trouble
he
drew
close
to
her
and
said
it
is
in
your
interest
and
not
in
mine
that
i
must
tell
you
that
the
duc
de
guise
does
not
deserve
the
choice
you
have
made
of
him
in
preference
to
me
a
choice
which
you
can
not
deny
and
of
which
i
am
well
aware
he
is
deceiving
you
madame
and
betraying
you
for
my
sister
as
he
betrayed
her
for
you
he
is
a
man
moved
only
by
ambition
but
since
he
has
the
good
fortune
to
please
you
that
is
enough
i
shall
not
attempt
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
felicity
which
without
doubt
i
merit
more
than
he
it
would
be
undignified
for
me
to
persist
in
trying
to
gain
the
heart
which
is
already
possessed
by
another
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
attracted
only
your
indifference
and
i
would
not
like
to
have
this
replaced
by
dislike
by
wearying
you
with
endless
protestations
of
unwelcome
devotion
the
duc
who
was
genuinely
touched
by
love
and
sadness
was
hardly
able
to
complete
this
speech
and
although
he
had
begun
in
a
spirit
of
spite
and
vengeance
he
was
so
overcome
when
he
thought
of
the
princess
beauty
and
of
what
he
was
losing
by
giving
up
all
hope
of
being
her
lover
that
without
waiting
for
her
reply
he
left
the
ball
saying
that
he
felt
unwell
and
went
home
to
nurse
his
grief
the
princess
de
montpensier
stayed
there
upset
and
worried
as
one
might
imagine
to
see
her
reputation
and
her
secret
in
the
hands
of
a
suitor
whom
she
had
rejected
and
to
learn
from
him
that
she
was
being
deceived
by
her
lover
were
not
things
which
would
put
her
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
for
a
place
dedicated
to
enjoyment
she
had
however
to
remain
where
she
was
and
later
go
to
supper
in
the
company
of
the
duchess
de
montpensier
her
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
followed
them
to
his
sister
house
was
dying
to
tell
her
what
the
duc
had
said
the
day
before
but
to
his
astonishment
when
he
did
have
the
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
he
was
overwhelmed
by
reproaches
which
were
tumbled
out
in
such
angry
profusion
that
all
he
could
gather
was
that
he
was
accused
of
infidelity
and
treachery
dismayed
at
finding
himself
in
this
unhappy
situation
when
he
had
hoped
for
consolation
and
being
so
much
in
love
with
the
princess
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
unsure
if
he
was
loved
in
return
he
took
a
sudden
decision
i
shall
lay
your
doubts
at
rest
he
said
i
am
going
to
do
what
all
the
royal
power
could
not
make
me
do
it
will
cost
me
my
fortune
but
that
is
of
little
account
if
it
makes
you
happy
he
went
straight
from
his
sister
house
to
that
of
his
uncle
the
cardinal
he
convinced
him
that
having
fallen
into
the
disfavour
it
was
essential
that
it
should
be
made
quite
clear
that
he
would
not
marry
madame
so
he
asked
for
his
marriage
to
be
arranged
with
the
princess
de
portien
a
matter
which
had
previously
been
discussed
the
news
of
this
was
soon
all
over
paris
and
gave
rise
to
much
surprise
the
princess
de
montpensier
was
both
happy
and
sad
glad
to
see
the
power
she
had
over
the
duc
and
sorry
that
she
had
caused
him
to
abandon
something
so
advantageous
as
marriage
to
madame
the
duc
who
hoped
that
love
would
compensate
him
for
his
material
loss
pressed
the
princess
to
give
him
a
private
audience
so
that
he
could
clear
up
the
unjust
accusations
which
she
had
made
he
obtained
this
when
she
found
herself
at
his
sister
house
at
a
time
when
his
sister
was
not
there
and
she
was
able
to
speak
to
him
alone
the
duc
took
the
opportunity
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
and
describe
all
that
he
had
suffered
because
of
her
suspicions
and
though
the
princess
was
unable
to
forget
what
the
duc
had
said
to
her
the
behaviour
of
the
duc
de
guise
did
much
to
reassure
her
she
told
him
exactly
why
she
believed
he
had
betrayed
her
which
was
because
the
duc
knew
what
he
could
only
have
learned
from
him
the
duc
did
not
know
how
to
defend
himself
and
was
as
puzzled
as
she
to
guess
what
could
have
given
away
their
secret
at
last
while
the
princess
was
remonstrating
with
him
for
giving
up
the
idea
of
the
advantageous
marriage
with
madame
and
rushing
into
that
with
the
princess
de
portien
she
said
to
him
that
he
could
have
been
certain
that
she
would
not
be
jealous
since
on
the
day
of
the
ball
she
herself
had
told
him
to
have
eyes
only
for
madame
the
duc
said
that
she
might
have
intended
to
do
so
but
that
she
certainly
had
not
she
maintained
that
she
had
and
in
the
end
they
reached
the
correct
conclusion
that
she
herself
deceived
by
the
resemblance
of
the
costumes
had
told
the
duc
what
she
accused
the
duc
de
guise
of
telling
him
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
almost
entirely
returned
to
favour
did
so
completely
as
a
result
of
this
conversation
the
princess
could
not
refuse
her
heart
to
a
man
who
had
possessed
it
in
the
past
and
had
just
made
such
a
sacrifice
to
please
her
she
consented
to
accept
his
declaration
and
permitted
him
to
believe
that
she
was
not
unmoved
by
his
passion
the
arrival
of
the
duchess
her
put
an
end
to
this
and
prevented
the
duc
from
demonstrating
his
transports
of
joy
some
time
later
the
court
having
gone
to
blois
the
marriage
between
the
king
of
navarre
and
madame
was
celebrated
the
duc
de
guise
who
wanted
nothing
more
than
the
love
of
the
princess
de
montpensier
enjoyed
a
ceremony
which
in
other
circumstances
would
have
overwhelmed
him
with
disappointment
the
duc
was
not
able
to
conceal
his
love
so
well
that
the
prince
de
montpensier
did
not
suspect
that
something
was
going
on
and
being
consumed
by
jealousy
he
ordered
his
wife
to
go
to
champigny
this
order
was
a
great
shock
to
her
but
she
had
to
obey
she
found
a
way
to
say
goodbye
to
the
duc
de
guise
privately
but
she
found
herself
in
great
difficulty
when
it
came
to
a
means
of
providing
a
method
whereby
he
could
write
to
her
after
much
thought
she
decided
to
make
use
of
the
comte
de
chabannes
whom
she
always
looked
on
as
a
friend
without
considering
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
the
duc
de
guise
who
knew
of
the
close
friendship
between
the
comte
and
the
prince
de
montpensier
was
at
first
amazed
at
her
choice
of
the
comte
as
a
but
she
assured
him
of
the
comte
fidelity
with
such
conviction
that
he
was
eventually
satisfied
he
parted
from
her
with
all
the
unhappiness
which
such
a
separation
can
cause
the
comte
de
chabannes
who
had
been
ill
in
paris
while
the
princess
was
at
blois
learning
that
she
was
going
to
champigny
arranged
to
meet
her
on
the
road
and
go
with
her
she
greeted
him
with
a
thousand
expressions
of
friendship
and
displayed
an
extraordinary
impatience
to
talk
to
him
in
private
which
at
first
delighted
him
judge
his
dismay
when
he
found
that
this
impatience
was
only
to
tell
him
that
she
was
loved
passionately
by
the
duc
de
guise
a
love
which
she
returned
he
was
so
distressed
that
he
was
unable
to
reply
the
princess
who
was
engrossed
by
her
infatuation
took
no
notice
of
his
silence
she
began
to
tell
him
all
the
least
details
of
the
events
and
how
she
and
the
duc
had
agreed
that
he
should
be
the
means
by
which
they
could
exchange
letters
the
thought
that
the
woman
he
loved
expected
him
to
be
of
assistance
to
his
rival
and
made
the
proposal
as
if
it
was
a
thing
he
would
find
agreeable
was
bitterly
hurtful
but
he
was
so
much
in
control
of
himself
that
he
hid
all
his
feelings
from
her
and
expressed
only
surprise
at
the
change
in
her
attitude
he
hoped
that
this
change
which
removed
even
the
faintest
hope
from
him
would
at
the
same
time
change
his
feelings
but
he
found
the
princess
so
charming
her
natural
beauty
having
been
enhanced
by
a
certain
grace
which
she
had
acquired
at
court
that
he
felt
that
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
this
remarkable
devotion
produced
a
remarkable
effect
he
agreed
to
carry
his
letters
to
his
beloved
the
princess
was
very
despondent
at
the
absence
of
the
duc
de
guise
and
could
hope
for
solace
only
from
his
letters
she
continually
tormented
the
comte
de
chabannes
to
know
if
he
had
received
any
and
almost
blamed
him
for
not
having
delivered
one
sooner
at
last
some
arrived
brought
by
a
gentleman
in
the
duc
service
which
he
took
to
her
immediately
so
as
not
to
delay
her
pleasure
for
a
moment
longer
than
necessary
the
princess
was
delighted
to
have
them
and
tortured
the
poor
comte
by
reading
them
to
him
as
well
as
her
tender
and
loving
reply
he
took
this
reply
to
the
waiting
courier
even
more
sadly
than
he
had
made
the
delivery
he
consoled
himself
a
little
by
the
reflection
that
the
princess
would
realise
what
he
was
doing
for
her
and
would
show
some
recognition
finding
however
that
she
daily
treated
him
with
less
consideration
owing
to
the
anxieties
which
preoccupied
her
he
took
the
liberty
of
begging
her
to
think
a
little
of
the
suffering
she
was
causing
him
the
princess
who
had
nothing
in
her
head
but
the
duc
de
guise
was
so
irritated
by
this
approach
that
she
treated
the
comte
much
worse
than
she
had
done
on
the
first
occasion
when
he
had
declared
his
love
for
her
although
his
devotion
and
patience
had
stood
so
many
trials
this
was
too
much
he
left
the
princess
and
went
to
live
with
a
friend
who
had
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
from
where
he
wrote
to
her
with
all
the
bitterness
that
her
behaviour
had
provoked
and
bid
her
an
eternal
adieu
the
princess
began
to
repent
having
dealt
so
harshly
with
a
man
over
whom
she
had
so
much
influence
and
being
unwilling
to
lose
him
not
only
on
account
of
their
past
friendship
but
also
because
of
his
vital
role
in
the
conduct
of
her
affair
she
sent
a
message
to
him
to
say
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
one
more
time
and
that
afterwards
she
would
leave
him
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
one
is
very
vulnerable
when
one
is
in
love
the
comte
came
back
and
in
less
than
an
hour
the
beauty
of
the
princess
her
charm
and
a
few
kind
words
made
him
more
submissive
than
ever
and
he
even
gave
her
some
letters
from
the
duc
de
guise
which
he
had
just
received
at
this
time
there
was
a
scheme
afoot
in
the
court
to
attract
there
all
the
leaders
of
the
huguenots
with
the
secret
aim
of
including
them
in
the
horrible
massacre
of
bartholomew
day
as
part
of
this
attempt
to
lull
them
into
a
false
sense
of
security
the
king
dismissed
from
his
presence
all
the
princes
of
the
houses
of
bourbon
and
de
guise
the
prince
de
montpensier
returned
to
champigny
to
the
utter
dismay
of
his
wife
the
duc
de
guise
went
to
the
home
of
his
uncle
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
love
and
idleness
induced
in
him
such
a
violent
desire
to
see
the
princess
de
montpensier
that
without
considering
the
risks
to
her
and
to
himself
he
made
some
excuse
to
travel
and
leaving
his
suite
in
a
small
town
he
took
with
him
only
the
gentleman
who
had
already
made
several
trips
to
champigny
and
went
there
by
as
he
knew
no
one
whom
he
could
approach
but
the
comte
de
chabannes
he
had
the
gentleman
write
a
note
requesting
a
meeting
at
a
certain
spot
the
comte
believing
that
this
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
letters
from
the
duc
de
guise
went
there
but
was
most
surprised
to
see
the
duc
himself
and
equally
dismayed
the
duc
full
of
his
own
plans
took
no
more
notice
of
the
comte
dismay
than
had
the
princess
of
his
silence
when
she
told
him
of
her
amour
he
described
his
passion
in
florid
terms
and
claimed
that
he
would
infallibly
die
if
the
princess
could
not
be
persuaded
to
see
him
the
comte
replied
coldly
that
he
would
tell
the
princess
all
that
the
duc
wanted
to
convey
and
would
return
with
her
response
he
then
went
back
to
champigny
with
his
own
emotions
in
such
a
turmoil
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
thought
of
sending
the
duc
away
without
saying
anything
to
the
princess
but
the
faithfulness
with
which
he
had
promised
to
serve
her
soon
put
an
end
to
that
idea
he
arrived
without
knowing
what
he
should
do
and
finding
that
the
prince
was
out
hunting
he
went
straight
to
the
princess
apartment
she
saw
that
he
was
distressed
and
dismissed
her
women
in
order
to
find
out
what
troubled
him
he
told
her
as
calmly
as
he
could
that
the
duc
de
guise
was
a
league
distant
and
that
he
wanted
passionately
to
see
her
the
princess
gave
a
cry
at
this
news
and
her
confusion
was
almost
as
great
as
that
of
the
comte
at
first
she
was
full
of
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
man
she
loved
so
tenderly
but
when
she
considered
how
much
this
was
against
her
principles
and
that
she
could
not
see
her
lover
without
introducing
him
into
her
home
during
the
night
and
without
her
husband
knowledge
she
found
herself
in
the
utmost
difficulty
the
comte
awaited
her
reply
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
life
or
death
realising
that
her
silence
indicated
her
uncertainty
he
took
the
liberty
of
presenting
to
her
all
the
perils
to
which
she
would
be
exposed
by
such
a
meeting
and
wishing
to
make
it
clear
that
he
was
not
doing
this
in
his
own
interest
he
said
that
if
in
spite
of
all
that
he
had
said
she
was
determined
to
see
the
duc
rather
than
see
her
seek
for
aid
from
helpers
less
faithful
than
himself
he
would
bring
the
duc
to
her
yes
madame
he
said
i
shall
go
and
find
the
duc
and
bring
him
to
your
apartment
for
it
is
too
dangerous
to
leave
him
for
long
where
he
is
but
how
can
this
be
done
interrupted
the
princess
ha
madame
cried
the
comte
it
is
then
decided
since
you
speak
only
of
the
method
i
shall
lead
him
through
the
park
only
order
one
of
your
maids
whom
you
can
trust
to
lower
exactly
at
midnight
the
little
drawbridge
which
leads
from
your
antechamber
to
the
flower
garden
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
having
said
this
he
rose
and
without
waiting
for
any
further
comment
from
the
princess
he
left
remounted
his
horse
and
went
to
look
for
the
duc
de
guise
who
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
greatest
impatience
the
princess
remained
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
came
to
her
senses
her
first
thought
was
to
send
someone
after
the
comte
to
tell
him
not
to
bring
the
duc
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
so
she
then
thought
that
failing
this
she
had
only
not
to
have
the
drawbridge
lowered
and
she
believed
that
she
would
continue
with
this
resolve
but
when
the
hour
of
the
assignation
drew
near
she
was
no
longer
able
to
resist
the
desire
to
see
the
lover
whom
she
longed
for
and
she
gave
instructions
to
one
of
her
women
on
the
method
by
which
the
duc
was
to
be
introduced
into
her
apartment
meanwhile
the
duc
and
the
comte
were
approaching
champigny
but
in
very
differing
frames
of
mind
the
duc
was
full
of
joy
and
all
the
happiness
of
expectation
the
comte
was
in
a
mood
of
despair
and
anger
which
tempted
him
at
times
to
run
his
sword
through
his
rival
they
at
last
reached
the
park
where
they
left
their
horses
in
the
care
of
the
squire
and
passing
through
a
gap
in
the
wall
they
came
to
the
flower
garden
the
comte
had
always
retained
some
hope
that
the
princess
would
come
to
her
senses
and
resolve
not
to
see
the
duc
but
when
he
saw
that
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
he
realised
that
his
hope
was
in
vain
he
was
tempted
to
take
some
desperate
measure
but
he
was
aware
that
any
noise
would
be
heard
by
the
prince
de
montpensier
whose
rooms
looked
out
onto
the
same
and
that
all
the
subsequent
disorder
would
fall
on
the
head
of
the
one
he
loved
most
he
calmed
himself
and
led
the
duc
to
the
presence
of
the
princess
although
the
princess
signaled
that
she
would
like
him
to
stay
in
the
room
during
the
interview
he
was
unwilling
to
do
so
and
retired
to
a
little
passage
which
ran
alongside
the
princess
apartment
a
prey
to
the
saddest
thoughts
which
could
afflict
a
disappointed
lover
now
although
they
had
made
very
little
noise
while
crossing
the
bridge
the
prince
de
montpensier
was
awake
and
heard
it
he
made
one
of
his
servants
get
up
and
go
to
see
what
it
was
the
servant
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
in
the
darkness
he
could
make
out
that
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
he
told
his
master
who
then
ordered
him
to
go
into
the
park
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
a
moment
later
he
got
up
himself
being
disturbed
by
what
he
thought
he
had
heard
that
is
footsteps
on
the
bridge
leading
to
his
wife
quarters
as
he
was
going
towards
the
little
passage
where
the
comte
was
waiting
the
princess
who
was
somewhat
embarrassed
at
being
alone
with
the
duc
de
guise
asked
the
latter
several
times
to
come
into
the
room
he
refused
to
do
so
and
as
she
continued
to
press
him
and
as
he
was
furiously
angry
he
answered
her
so
loudly
that
he
was
heard
by
the
prince
de
montpensier
but
so
indistinctly
that
the
prince
heard
only
a
man
voice
without
being
able
to
recognise
it
as
that
of
the
comte
these
events
would
have
infuriated
a
character
more
placid
and
less
jealous
than
the
prince
de
montpensier
he
hurled
himself
against
the
door
calling
for
it
to
be
opened
and
cruelly
surprising
the
princess
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
comte
de
chabannes
this
last
hearing
the
prince
voice
saw
immediately
that
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
him
from
believing
that
there
was
someone
in
his
wife
room
and
that
he
was
in
such
a
state
that
if
he
found
that
it
was
the
duc
de
guise
he
might
kill
him
before
the
eyes
of
the
princess
and
that
even
her
life
might
be
at
risk
he
decided
in
an
act
of
extraordinary
generosity
to
sacrifice
himself
to
save
a
successful
rival
and
an
ungrateful
mistress
while
the
prince
was
battering
on
the
door
he
went
to
the
duc
who
had
no
idea
what
to
do
put
him
in
the
care
of
the
woman
who
had
arranged
his
entry
by
the
bridge
and
told
her
to
show
him
the
way
out
scarcely
had
he
left
when
the
prince
having
broken
down
the
door
entered
the
room
like
a
man
possessed
however
when
he
saw
only
the
comte
de
chabannes
motionless
leaning
on
a
table
with
a
look
of
infinite
sadness
on
his
face
he
stopped
short
the
astonishment
of
finding
his
best
friend
alone
at
night
in
his
wife
room
deprived
him
of
speech
the
princess
had
collapsed
onto
some
cushions
and
never
perhaps
has
fate
put
three
people
in
a
more
unhappy
position
at
last
the
prince
made
an
attempt
to
make
sense
of
the
chaos
before
his
eyes
he
addressed
the
comte
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
still
had
some
friendliness
what
is
this
i
see
he
said
is
it
possible
that
a
man
i
love
so
dearly
has
chosen
among
all
other
women
to
seduce
my
wife
and
you
madame
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
was
it
not
enough
to
deprive
me
of
your
love
and
my
honour
without
depriving
me
of
the
one
man
who
could
have
consoled
me
in
such
circumstances
answer
me
one
of
you
he
said
to
them
and
explain
this
affair
which
i
can
not
believe
is
what
it
seems
the
princess
was
incapable
of
replying
and
the
comte
opened
his
mouth
once
or
twice
but
was
unable
to
speak
you
see
me
as
a
criminal
he
said
at
last
and
unworthy
of
the
friendship
you
have
shown
me
but
the
situation
is
not
what
you
may
think
it
is
i
am
more
unhappy
than
you
and
more
despairing
i
do
not
know
how
to
tell
you
more
than
that
my
death
would
avenge
you
and
if
you
were
to
kill
me
now
you
would
be
doing
me
a
favour
these
words
spoken
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
sorrow
and
in
a
manner
which
declared
his
innocence
instead
of
enlightening
the
prince
confirmed
him
in
the
view
that
something
mysterious
was
going
on
which
he
did
not
understand
his
unhappiness
was
increased
by
this
uncertainty
kill
me
yourself
he
said
or
give
me
some
explanation
of
your
words
for
i
can
understand
nothing
you
owe
it
to
my
friendship
you
owe
it
to
my
restraint
for
anyone
but
me
would
have
already
taken
your
life
to
avenge
such
an
affront
the
appearances
are
wholly
misleading
interrupted
the
comte
ah
it
is
too
much
i
must
be
avenged
and
clear
things
up
later
said
the
prince
advancing
towards
the
comte
like
a
man
carried
away
by
rage
the
princess
fearing
bloodshed
which
was
not
possible
as
her
husband
did
not
have
a
sword
placed
herself
between
the
two
of
them
and
fell
fainting
at
her
husband
feet
the
prince
was
even
more
affected
by
this
than
he
was
by
the
calmness
of
the
comte
when
he
confronted
him
and
as
if
he
could
no
longer
bear
the
sight
of
those
two
people
who
had
caused
him
such
distress
he
turned
away
and
fell
on
his
wife
bed
overcome
by
grief
the
comte
de
chabannes
filled
with
remorse
at
having
abused
the
friendship
of
which
he
had
had
so
many
marks
and
believing
that
he
could
never
atone
for
what
he
had
done
left
the
room
abruptly
and
passing
through
the
princess
apartment
where
he
found
all
the
doors
open
he
went
down
to
the
courtyard
he
had
a
horse
brought
to
him
and
rode
off
into
the
country
led
only
by
his
feelings
of
hopelessness
the
prince
de
montpensier
seeing
that
his
wife
did
not
recover
from
her
faint
left
her
to
her
women
and
retired
to
his
own
quarters
greatly
disturbed
the
duc
de
guise
having
got
out
of
the
park
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
being
in
such
a
state
of
turmoil
put
several
leagues
between
himself
and
champigny
but
could
go
no
further
without
news
of
the
princess
he
stopped
in
the
forest
and
sent
his
squire
to
find
out
from
the
comte
de
chabannes
what
had
happened
the
squire
found
no
trace
of
chabannes
but
was
told
by
others
that
the
princess
was
seriously
ill
the
duc
inquietude
was
increased
by
what
the
squire
had
told
him
but
as
he
could
do
nothing
he
was
constrained
to
go
back
to
his
uncle
in
order
not
to
raise
suspicions
by
too
long
an
absence
the
duc
squire
had
been
correct
when
he
said
that
the
princess
was
seriously
ill
for
as
soon
as
her
women
had
put
her
to
bed
she
was
seized
by
a
violent
fever
with
horrible
phantasies
so
that
by
the
second
day
her
life
was
despaired
of
the
prince
pretended
that
he
himself
was
ill
so
that
no
one
should
be
surprised
that
he
did
not
visit
his
wife
room
the
order
which
he
received
to
return
to
the
court
to
which
all
the
catholic
princes
were
being
recalled
in
preparation
for
the
massacre
of
the
huguenots
relieved
him
of
his
embarrassment
he
went
off
to
paris
without
knowing
what
he
had
to
hope
or
fear
about
his
wife
illness
he
had
hardly
arrived
there
when
the
assault
on
the
huguenots
was
signalised
by
the
attack
on
admiral
de
chatillon
two
days
later
came
the
disgraceful
massacre
now
so
well
known
throughout
europe
the
poor
comte
de
chabannes
who
had
gone
to
hide
himself
away
in
one
of
the
outer
suburbs
of
paris
to
abandon
himself
to
his
misery
was
caught
up
in
the
ruin
of
the
huguenots
the
people
to
whose
house
he
had
retired
having
recognised
him
and
having
recalled
that
he
had
once
been
suspected
of
being
of
that
persuasion
murdered
him
on
the
same
night
which
was
fatal
to
so
many
people
the
next
day
the
prince
de
montpensier
who
was
in
that
area
on
duty
passed
along
the
street
where
the
body
of
the
comte
lay
he
was
at
first
shocked
by
this
pitiful
sight
and
recalling
his
past
friendship
was
grieved
but
then
the
memory
of
the
offence
which
he
believed
the
comte
had
committed
made
him
feel
pleased
that
he
had
been
avenged
by
the
hand
of
chance
the
duc
de
guise
who
had
used
the
opportunity
of
the
massacre
to
take
ample
revenge
for
the
death
of
his
father
gradually
took
less
and
less
interest
in
the
condition
of
the
princess
of
montpensier
and
having
met
the
marquise
de
noirmoutier
a
woman
of
wit
and
beauty
and
one
who
promised
more
than
the
princess
de
montpensier
he
attached
himself
to
her
an
attachment
which
lasted
a
lifetime
the
princess
illness
reached
a
crisis
and
then
began
to
remit
she
recovered
her
senses
and
was
somewhat
relieved
by
the
absence
of
her
husband
she
was
expected
to
live
but
her
health
recovered
very
slowly
because
of
her
low
spirits
which
were
further
depressed
by
the
realisation
that
she
had
received
no
news
of
the
duc
de
guise
during
all
her
illness
she
asked
her
women
if
they
had
not
seen
anyone
if
they
had
not
had
any
letters
and
finding
that
there
had
been
nothing
she
saw
herself
as
the
most
wretched
of
women
one
who
had
risked
all
for
a
man
who
had
abandoned
her
a
fresh
blow
was
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
comte
de
chabannes
which
her
husband
made
sure
she
heard
about
as
soon
as
possible
the
ingratitude
of
the
duc
de
guise
made
her
feel
even
more
deeply
the
loss
of
a
man
whose
fidelity
she
knew
so
well
these
disappointments
weighed
heavily
upon
her
and
reduced
her
to
a
state
as
serious
as
that
from
which
she
had
recently
recovered
madame
de
noirmoutier
was
a
woman
who
took
as
much
care
to
publicise
her
affairs
as
others
do
to
conceal
them
her
relations
with
the
duc
de
guise
were
so
open
that
even
though
far
away
and
ill
the
princess
heard
so
much
about
it
that
she
was
left
in
no
doubt
this
was
the
final
straw
she
had
lost
the
regard
of
her
husband
the
heart
of
her
lover
and
the
most
loyal
of
her
friends
she
took
to
her
bed
and
died
not
long
after
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
she
was
one
of
the
loveliest
of
women
and
could
have
been
one
of
the
happiest
