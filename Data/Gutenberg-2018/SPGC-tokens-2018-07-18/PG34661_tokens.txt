i
the
wagon
had
come
to
rest
among
the
trees
an
hour
or
two
before
sunset
it
was
a
dray
and
had
been
brought
to
in
a
little
clearing
of
the
scrubby
undergrowth
two
horses
had
drawn
it
all
the
way
from
the
coast
freed
of
their
harness
they
stood
in
the
lee
of
a
great
gum
their
flanks
matted
with
the
dust
which
had
caked
with
the
run
of
sweat
on
them
the
mongrel
that
had
followed
at
their
heels
lay
stretched
on
the
sward
beside
them
a
cow
and
her
calf
were
tethered
to
a
wheel
of
the
wagon
and
at
a
little
distance
from
them
were
two
battered
crates
of
drooping
and
drowsy
fowls
on
a
patch
of
earth
scraped
clear
of
grass
and
leaves
the
fire
threw
off
wisps
of
smoke
and
the
dry
musky
incense
of
burning
eucalyptus
and
dogwood
it
had
smouldered
and
a
woman
stooping
beside
it
was
feeding
it
with
branches
of
brushwood
and
sticks
that
she
broke
in
her
hands
or
across
her
knees
a
man
was
busy
in
the
interior
of
the
wagon
moving
heavy
casks
and
pieces
of
furniture
he
lifted
them
out
piled
them
on
the
ground
and
spread
a
couple
of
sheepskins
over
them
then
he
threw
a
sheepskin
and
a
blanket
of
black
and
brown
tweed
on
the
floor
for
the
night
resting
it
had
been
climbing
the
foothills
for
days
this
heavy
vehicle
and
the
man
and
the
woman
had
climbed
with
it
she
driving
the
cow
and
calf
he
giving
his
attention
to
the
horses
and
clearing
the
track
so
slowly
had
it
toiled
along
that
at
a
little
distance
it
looked
like
some
weary
indefatigable
insect
creeping
among
the
trees
the
horses
a
sturdy
young
mare
and
a
raw
weedy
bay
seemed
as
much
part
of
it
as
its
wooden
frame
ironshod
wheels
and
awning
of
grimy
sailcloth
they
tugged
at
their
load
with
dull
dumb
patience
and
obstinacy
although
the
bay
had
stumbled
rather
badly
the
whole
way
the
man
had
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
helping
the
horses
up
the
steep
banks
and
long
slippery
sidings
he
had
stood
trembling
and
sweating
with
them
when
heavy
places
in
the
road
were
past
the
veins
knotted
in
his
swarthy
forehead
the
bare
column
of
his
throat
gasping
for
the
mountain
air
there
was
the
same
toiling
faculty
in
him
that
there
was
in
the
horses
an
instinct
to
overcome
all
difficulties
by
exertion
of
the
muscles
of
his
back
the
wagon
had
creaked
garrulously
on
the
long
slopes
and
stuttered
and
groaned
up
the
steep
hill
sides
it
had
forded
creeks
the
horses
splashing
soberly
through
them
and
sending
the
spray
into
the
air
on
either
side
it
had
crashed
over
the
undergrowth
that
encroached
on
the
track
an
stock
route
among
the
trees
and
again
and
again
the
man
had
been
obliged
to
haul
aside
fallen
timber
or
burn
it
where
it
lay
and
cut
away
saplings
in
order
to
make
a
new
path
the
wagon
was
filled
with
boxes
and
bags
of
food
stuffs
and
pieces
of
furniture
inside
it
smelt
like
a
grocer
shop
and
it
had
trailed
the
mingled
odour
of
meal
corned
meat
hemp
iron
seed
wheat
crude
oil
and
potatoes
through
the
virgin
purity
of
the
forest
air
beneath
its
floor
in
wrappings
of
torn
bags
straw
and
hessian
were
lashed
a
wooden
plough
a
shovel
and
half
a
dozen
farming
and
carpentering
tools
the
fowls
a
game
rooster
a
buff
hen
and
a
speckled
pullet
hung
in
wicker
baskets
from
wooden
pegs
at
the
back
they
and
the
cow
and
her
calf
had
wakened
strange
echoes
in
the
forest
the
rooster
heralding
every
morning
at
dawn
this
advance
guard
of
civilisation
when
the
vehicle
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
foothills
the
track
fell
wavering
into
the
green
depths
of
the
forest
behind
it
a
wale
of
broken
ferns
slain
saplings
blue
gums
and
myrtles
mown
down
as
with
a
scythe
by
its
wheels
the
timbered
hills
fell
away
wave
upon
wave
into
the
mists
of
the
distance
and
the
plains
stretched
outward
from
them
to
the
faintly
glittering
line
the
sea
made
on
the
dim
horizon
somewhere
to
the
west
on
those
grey
plains
against
the
shore
of
an
inlet
was
the
township
of
port
southern
from
which
they
had
come
donald
cameron
after
studying
a
plan
and
the
wall
of
the
forest
about
him
had
taken
the
mare
by
her
sandy
forelock
and
turned
the
wagon
in
among
the
trees
on
the
far
side
of
a
giant
gum
blazed
with
a
cross
on
which
the
congealing
sap
had
dried
like
blood
steering
a
course
the
wagon
had
tacked
among
the
trees
and
come
to
the
clearing
and
now
that
all
preparations
for
the
night
were
made
he
took
the
animals
to
the
creek
for
water
it
ran
at
the
foot
of
the
long
low
hillside
and
could
be
heard
crooning
and
gurgling
under
the
leafy
murmur
of
the
forest
leaving
the
fire
the
woman
went
to
a
fallen
trunk
sat
down
and
gazed
into
the
shadows
gathering
among
the
trees
a
rosy
and
saffron
mist
hung
between
their
thronging
boles
the
peace
of
the
held
the
hills
the
chirring
of
insects
and
the
shrill
sweet
calling
of
birds
had
quivered
into
silence
only
a
leafy
whispering
stirred
the
quiet
for
a
moment
the
fire
of
her
clear
spirit
burnt
low
hope
and
courage
were
lost
in
dreams
there
was
wistfulness
in
her
grey
eyes
as
they
went
out
before
her
wistfulness
and
heartache
she
seemed
to
be
reading
the
scroll
of
the
future
seeing
a
dim
mysterious
unrolling
of
joys
and
sorrows
with
the
eyes
of
her
inner
vision
the
sun
had
set
when
cameron
returned
he
tethered
the
cow
to
the
wheel
of
the
wagon
and
clamped
rusty
hobbles
about
the
horses
fetlocks
then
he
looked
towards
the
woman
mary
he
called
she
did
not
hear
and
he
walked
towards
her
a
man
of
few
words
cameron
did
not
speak
as
he
searched
his
face
i
i
was
dreaming
she
said
looking
up
startled
at
the
sight
of
him
you
not
grieving
he
asked
there
was
a
tremor
in
his
voice
though
its
roughness
almost
covered
that
no
not
grieving
she
said
but
thinking
what
it
will
be
to
us
and
our
children
by
and
by
in
this
place
it
is
a
new
country
and
a
new
people
we
making
they
said
at
home
and
i
realising
what
they
meant
now
aye
but
it
a
fine
country
cameron
eyes
travelled
the
length
of
the
clearing
over
the
slope
of
the
hill
they
took
in
the
silent
world
of
the
trees
the
rosy
mist
that
still
glowed
between
their
slender
thronging
stems
there
was
pride
and
an
expression
of
sated
hunger
in
his
glance
it
all
ours
this
land
about
here
he
said
yes
her
eyes
wandered
too
i
have
worked
all
my
days
till
now
he
said
reviving
a
bitter
memory
without
so
much
as
a
plot
of
sour
earth
as
big
as
handkerchief
to
call
my
own
worked
for
other
men
sweated
the
body
and
soul
out
of
me
and
now
this
is
mine
all
this
hundred
acres
and
more
when
i
ready
for
it
more
and
more
and
more
he
paused
a
moment
all
the
emotion
in
him
stirred
and
surging
then
with
a
breath
that
dismissed
the
past
and
dedicated
thought
and
energy
to
the
future
he
went
on
i
marked
this
place
when
i
came
through
to
the
port
with
cattle
last
year
i
run
cattle
but
i
want
to
clear
and
cultivate
too
up
there
where
there
are
trees
now
will
be
ploughed
fields
and
an
orchard
soon
the
house
and
barns
be
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
by
and
by
we
shall
have
a
name
and
a
place
in
the
country
his
wife
eyes
were
on
his
face
he
had
spoken
as
though
he
were
taking
an
oath
no
doubt
it
will
be
as
you
say
donald
she
said
with
a
faint
sigh
but
it
is
a
strange
lonely
land
indeed
without
the
sight
of
a
roof
in
all
the
long
miles
we
have
come
by
never
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
or
the
lowing
of
cattle
donald
cameron
did
not
reply
he
was
envisaging
his
schemes
for
the
future
not
a
man
given
to
dreams
the
thoughtful
mood
had
taken
him
his
breath
came
and
went
in
steady
draughts
his
face
was
set
to
the
mould
of
his
musing
there
was
determination
in
every
line
of
it
a
gloomy
face
it
was
with
deep
set
eyes
his
wife
words
and
the
sigh
that
went
with
them
were
repeated
in
a
remote
brain
cell
you
should
be
giving
thanks
not
complaining
he
said
his
gaze
returning
to
her
we
must
do
that
now
give
thanks
for
the
journey
accomplished
and
as
if
it
were
the
last
duty
of
a
day
he
knelt
on
the
grassy
earth
and
mary
knelt
beside
him
donald
cameron
addressed
his
god
as
man
speaks
to
man
yet
his
voice
had
a
vibrating
note
as
he
prayed
o
lord
he
said
we
thank
thee
for
having
brought
us
in
safety
to
our
new
home
we
thank
thee
for
having
brought
us
over
the
sea
through
the
storms
and
the
troubles
on
the
ship
when
there
was
nothing
to
eat
but
weevily
biscuits
and
the
water
stank
and
there
was
like
to
be
mutiny
with
the
men
in
the
chained
gangs
we
we
thank
thee
this
woman
and
i
she
is
a
good
woman
for
a
man
to
have
with
him
when
he
goes
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
carve
out
a
name
and
a
place
for
himself
he
paused
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
i
have
said
all
that
before
but
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
would
do
no
harm
to
say
it
again
now
that
we
are
ready
to
begin
the
new
life
and
will
need
all
thy
help
and
protection
lord
we
thank
thee
for
having
brought
us
all
the
miles
from
the
coast
and
the
beasts
and
the
wagon
in
safety
though
the
bay
horse
i
bought
of
middleton
storekeeper
is
turning
out
badly
he
was
a
poor
bargain
at
the
best
of
it
weak
in
the
knee
and
do
thou
have
a
care
of
him
lord
it
will
be
a
big
loss
to
me
if
he
is
no
use
with
all
the
clearing
and
carting
there
will
be
to
do
soon
he
talked
a
little
longer
to
the
almighty
asking
no
favour
but
intimating
that
he
expected
to
be
justly
dealt
by
as
he
himself
dealt
by
all
men
in
the
matter
of
the
bay
he
said
that
he
did
not
think
a
man
had
been
treated
quite
as
well
as
under
the
circumstances
he
might
have
been
but
he
imputed
no
blame
except
to
middleton
storekeeper
and
gave
thanks
again
a
man
of
middle
height
squarely
built
donald
cameron
had
the
loosely
slung
frame
of
a
farm
labourer
the
woman
beside
him
although
her
clothes
were
as
poor
and
heavy
as
his
was
more
finely
and
delicately
made
the
hands
clasped
before
her
were
long
and
slender
the
prayer
ended
they
rose
from
the
grass
cameron
eyes
covered
his
wife
a
gust
of
tenderness
swept
him
there
was
not
what
you
might
call
much
sentiment
about
our
mating
he
said
but
i
doubt
not
it
has
come
mary
yes
donald
her
clear
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
may
i
be
a
true
and
faithful
wife
to
you
y
not
regretting
at
the
long
journey
end
he
asked
it
not
that
a
sigh
went
from
her
but
that
i
not
worthy
of
you
whist
he
said
you
my
woman
my
wife
it
all
done
with
the
past
chapter
ii
a
few
months
later
mary
cameron
voice
as
she
sang
lullabies
to
her
baby
mingled
with
the
forest
murmur
and
the
sounds
that
came
from
the
clearing
the
lowing
of
the
cow
the
clucking
and
cackle
of
fowls
the
clang
of
donald
axe
as
he
trees
near
the
house
a
hut
built
of
long
saplings
ranged
one
above
the
other
and
thatched
with
coarse
bark
laid
on
in
slabs
it
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
not
far
from
the
wagon
first
resting
place
its
two
doors
set
opposite
each
other
opened
one
towards
the
back
hills
and
the
other
towards
the
creek
and
the
cleared
land
on
which
a
stubble
of
stumps
still
stood
the
walls
of
the
hut
inside
were
plastered
with
the
clayey
hill
soil
which
mary
had
rammed
into
crevices
between
the
saplings
when
daylight
had
at
first
showed
in
thin
shining
streaks
and
the
mountain
breezes
had
crept
chilly
through
them
in
the
early
mornings
she
had
made
the
floor
of
beaten
clay
too
and
had
gathered
from
the
creek
bed
the
grey
and
brown
stones
which
donald
had
built
into
the
hearth
and
chimney
with
seams
of
lime
and
fine
white
sand
that
he
had
brought
from
the
port
a
window
space
had
been
left
in
the
wall
fronting
the
clearing
but
there
was
no
glass
in
it
at
night
or
when
it
rained
mary
hung
a
piece
of
hessian
over
the
window
two
chairs
were
the
only
furniture
of
the
room
the
boxes
and
bales
brought
in
the
wagon
were
piled
in
a
corner
a
table
made
of
with
sapling
legs
driven
into
the
floor
was
under
the
window
and
a
bed
on
a
wooden
foundation
strapped
with
stood
against
the
back
wall
a
few
pieces
of
delft
and
white
crockery
glimmered
on
a
shelf
near
the
open
fireplace
and
below
them
on
another
shelf
were
stone
jars
and
two
or
three
pots
and
pans
donald
harness
saddle
and
hung
on
pegs
near
the
back
door
among
the
bales
and
boxes
under
a
dingy
muffling
cloth
stood
a
spinning
wheel
and
tied
together
with
lengths
of
dusty
yarn
the
parts
of
a
weaver
hand
loom
which
mary
had
brought
from
the
old
country
on
sundays
when
a
bright
fire
sparkled
on
the
hearth
the
mats
of
frayed
hessian
were
spread
on
the
floor
and
she
had
put
a
jar
filled
with
wild
flowers
on
the
table
her
eyes
brimmed
with
joy
and
tenderness
as
she
gazed
about
her
she
had
toiled
all
the
summer
out
of
doors
with
her
husband
to
make
their
home
with
him
grubbing
stumps
from
the
land
laying
twigs
and
leaves
in
the
stumps
and
lighting
them
so
that
the
slow
fires
eating
the
wood
left
only
charred
shells
to
clear
away
she
had
driven
lassie
the
grey
backwards
and
forwards
drawing
logs
and
tree
trunks
from
the
slope
to
the
stack
behind
the
house
and
when
the
frames
of
the
wagon
shed
cow
sheds
and
stable
were
up
had
laced
the
brushwood
to
them
the
weedy
brown
nag
that
was
lassie
trace
mate
during
those
first
weeks
in
the
hills
had
come
down
and
got
himself
rather
badly
staked
and
donald
had
had
to
shoot
him
it
cost
him
a
good
deal
to
fire
that
shot
but
he
had
worked
the
harder
for
it
mary
watched
the
cow
while
she
browsed
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
before
a
paddock
on
the
top
of
the
hill
was
fenced
she
milked
fed
the
calf
and
the
fowls
and
carried
water
from
the
creek
to
the
house
when
she
was
not
doing
any
of
these
things
or
baking
brushing
or
furbishing
indoors
during
those
first
few
months
her
fingers
were
busy
with
little
garments
shirts
and
gowns
and
overalls
cut
from
her
own
clothes
of
homespun
tweed
and
unbleached
calico
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
long
golden
day
that
a
cry
from
her
brought
donald
from
the
far
edge
of
the
clearing
he
was
turning
the
land
for
his
first
crop
and
when
he
heard
that
cry
left
the
mare
in
her
tracks
the
rope
lines
trailing
beside
her
later
his
hands
trembling
he
took
lassie
from
the
plough
and
led
her
to
the
creek
for
water
then
although
the
sun
had
not
set
he
hobbled
her
for
the
night
went
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
usually
all
was
silent
within
its
walls
when
the
darkness
fell
but
this
night
a
garish
light
flickered
under
the
door
there
were
sounds
of
hushed
movement
faint
moaning
the
crackling
of
fire
on
the
hearth
all
night
the
dog
lying
on
the
mat
by
the
door
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
growled
low
and
warningly
now
and
then
towards
morning
while
stars
still
sparkled
over
the
dark
wave
of
the
forest
a
faintly
wailing
cry
came
from
the
hut
the
dog
ears
twitched
his
yelping
had
an
eerie
note
sunlight
was
flooding
the
hills
illumining
the
forest
greenery
making
crimson
and
gold
of
the
shoots
on
the
saplings
banishing
the
mists
among
the
trees
splashing
in
long
shafts
on
the
sward
wet
with
dew
when
donald
cameron
opened
the
door
his
arms
were
folded
round
a
shawled
bundle
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
the
sunlight
beating
past
him
into
the
hut
then
he
lifted
the
small
body
in
his
arms
kissed
it
and
held
it
out
to
the
dawn
his
face
wrung
with
emotion
all
this
yours
your
world
my
son
he
said
they
were
quiet
days
that
followed
days
spun
off
in
lengths
of
sunshine
from
the
looms
of
time
with
the
sleepy
warmth
of
the
end
of
the
summer
and
the
musky
odours
of
the
forest
in
them
mary
worked
less
out
of
doors
when
she
was
about
again
her
hands
were
full
cooking
washing
and
sewing
and
looking
after
the
animals
and
the
baby
she
sang
to
him
as
she
worked
all
her
joy
and
tenderness
were
centred
in
him
now
donald
did
not
understand
the
love
songs
she
sang
to
little
davey
they
were
always
in
her
own
welsh
tongue
it
queer
talk
to
make
to
a
bairn
he
said
one
day
smiling
grimly
as
he
listened
to
her
he
understands
it
i
sure
she
said
smiling
too
cameron
sang
himself
sometimes
when
he
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
clearing
it
was
always
the
same
thing
the
gathering
song
of
the
clan
of
donald
the
black
while
he
was
ploughing
one
morning
mary
first
heard
him
singing
pibroch
o
donuil
dhu
pibroch
o
donuil
wake
thy
wild
voice
anew
summon
clan
conuil
the
words
of
the
grand
old
slogan
echoed
among
the
hills
when
next
she
heard
it
mary
lifted
davey
out
of
his
cradle
and
ran
to
the
door
with
him
crying
happily
listen
now
davey
dear
to
thy
father
singing
cameron
had
interrupted
himself
to
call
to
the
mare
as
she
turned
a
furrow
whoa
lass
whoa
now
he
had
gone
on
with
his
song
as
he
bent
the
share
to
the
slope
of
the
hill
again
a
hidden
root
checked
his
progress
but
when
he
had
got
it
out
of
the
way
and
the
plough
settled
again
he
swung
down
hill
giving
his
voice
to
the
wind
heartily
leave
untended
the
herd
the
flock
without
shelter
leave
the
corpse
uninterred
the
bride
at
the
altar
leave
the
deer
leave
the
steer
leave
nets
and
barges
come
in
your
fighting
gear
broad
swords
and
t
a
r
ges
his
voice
had
not
much
music
but
mary
loved
the
way
he
sang
with
the
fierceness
and
burr
the
rumble
on
the
last
word
of
a
chieftain
calling
his
men
to
battle
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
calling
his
tribesmen
to
help
him
in
the
battle
he
had
on
hand
but
he
was
as
shamefaced
as
a
schoolboy
about
his
singing
and
it
was
only
when
he
was
some
distance
from
the
house
and
had
forgotten
himself
in
his
work
that
he
gave
expression
to
the
joy
and
satisfaction
with
life
that
were
in
him
davey
was
four
months
old
and
the
paddock
his
father
had
been
ploughing
the
day
he
was
born
was
green
with
the
blades
of
its
first
crop
when
mary
asked
when
will
you
be
going
back
to
the
port
donald
she
had
taken
cameron
tea
to
him
where
he
was
working
among
the
trees
a
little
way
from
the
clearing
he
was
resting
for
a
few
minutes
sitting
on
a
log
with
his
axe
beside
him
she
spoke
quietly
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
enough
question
she
had
asked
her
eyes
sought
his
there
very
little
flour
left
and
only
a
small
piece
of
corned
meat
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
day
after
he
said
chapter
iii
this
journey
to
port
southern
for
stores
meant
that
mary
would
have
to
remain
alone
in
the
hills
until
her
husband
returned
the
cow
and
calf
had
to
be
fed
and
looked
after
they
were
valuable
possessions
and
could
not
be
left
for
fear
they
might
wander
away
from
the
clearing
and
get
lost
in
the
scrub
besides
there
were
the
fowls
to
feed
and
the
crop
to
guard
from
the
shy
wild
creatures
that
already
lopping
out
of
the
forest
at
dawn
had
nibbled
it
down
in
places
cameron
eyes
lingered
on
his
wife
as
he
answered
her
question
she
stood
bareheaded
before
him
the
afternoon
sunlight
outlining
her
figure
and
setting
threads
of
gold
in
her
hair
the
coming
of
the
child
had
made
her
vaguely
dearer
to
him
this
journey
had
not
been
mentioned
between
them
since
davey
birth
he
had
tried
to
put
off
making
it
ekeing
out
their
dwindling
supply
of
corned
meat
by
shooting
the
brown
wallabys
which
came
out
of
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
surprised
at
the
sight
of
strange
and
creatures
they
and
the
little
grey
furry
animals
that
scurried
high
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
on
moonlight
nights
made
very
good
food
donald
cameron
had
been
told
that
no
man
need
starve
in
the
hills
while
he
had
a
gun
and
there
were
in
the
trees
but
neither
he
nor
mary
liked
the
strong
flavour
of
flesh
tasting
as
it
did
of
the
pungent
eucalyptus
buds
and
leaves
the
little
creatures
lived
on
he
shot
the
for
the
sake
of
their
skins
though
spread
and
tacked
the
grey
pelts
against
the
wall
of
the
house
and
when
the
sun
had
dried
them
mary
stitched
them
into
a
rug
she
had
lined
davey
cradle
with
them
too
donald
made
ready
for
his
journey
next
day
during
the
morning
he
took
his
gun
down
from
the
shelf
above
the
door
cleaned
it
and
called
his
wife
out
of
doors
he
showed
her
how
to
use
it
and
made
her
take
aim
at
a
tall
tree
at
the
end
of
the
clearing
you
must
have
no
fires
or
light
in
the
place
after
sundown
he
said
and
let
the
grub
fires
in
the
stumps
die
out
bar
the
doors
at
night
and
if
blacks
or
a
white
man
sets
foot
in
the
hut
y
the
gun
and
must
use
it
do
hesitate
it
the
law
in
this
country
every
man
for
himself
and
a
woman
is
doubly
justified
you
understand
yes
of
course
she
answered
and
i
leave
you
the
dog
he
went
on
he
a
good
watch
and
give
warning
if
there
any
danger
about
yes
she
said
when
the
morning
came
she
went
to
the
track
in
the
wagon
with
him
carrying
davey
she
got
down
when
they
reached
the
track
he
kissed
her
and
the
child
and
turned
his
back
on
them
silently
she
stood
watching
the
wagon
go
along
the
path
they
had
come
by
from
the
port
until
its
roof
dipped
out
of
sight
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
then
she
went
slowly
back
along
the
threadlike
path
among
the
trees
a
bird
flapped
across
her
path
already
fear
of
the
stillness
was
upon
her
when
she
reached
the
break
in
the
trees
and
the
clearing
was
visible
the
hut
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
had
an
alien
aspect
the
air
was
empty
without
the
sound
of
donald
axe
clanging
in
the
distance
or
of
his
voice
calling
lassie
she
was
glad
when
davey
began
to
cry
fretfully
but
she
could
not
sing
to
him
she
tried
and
her
voice
wavered
and
broke
every
other
murmur
in
the
stillness
was
subdued
to
listen
to
it
the
day
seemed
endless
at
last
night
came
she
closed
and
barred
the
door
of
the
hut
at
sunset
glancing
towards
the
shelf
where
donald
had
put
his
gun
the
firelight
flickered
and
gleamed
on
its
polished
barrel
kneeling
by
the
hearth
she
tried
to
pray
but
her
thoughts
were
flying
in
an
incoherent
flight
like
scattered
birds
davey
slept
peacefully
on
the
bed
among
the
grey
furs
she
had
wrapped
round
him
she
watched
him
sleeping
for
awhile
and
then
undressing
noiselessly
lay
down
beside
him
she
did
not
sleep
but
lay
listening
to
every
sound
the
creak
of
the
wood
of
the
house
the
panting
of
the
wind
about
it
sounds
among
the
trees
the
shrill
cry
of
a
night
creature
every
stir
and
rustle
until
the
pale
light
of
early
dawn
crept
under
the
door
and
she
knew
that
it
was
day
again
while
she
was
busy
in
the
morning
she
was
unconscious
of
the
world
about
her
or
the
flight
of
the
day
but
when
her
work
was
done
and
she
stood
in
the
doorway
at
noon
the
silence
struck
her
again
all
the
long
day
there
was
a
faint
busy
hum
of
insects
in
the
air
it
came
from
the
grass
from
the
trees
the
long
tasselled
branches
of
downy
white
blossoms
that
hung
from
them
yet
this
ceaseless
chirring
of
insects
the
leafy
murmuring
of
the
trees
twittering
of
birds
in
the
brushwood
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
in
distant
valleys
the
intermittent
crooning
and
drone
of
the
creek
all
the
faint
sweet
earth
voices
dropped
into
the
great
quiet
that
brooded
over
the
place
as
they
might
have
into
a
mysterious
ocean
that
absorbed
and
obliterated
all
sounds
the
bright
hours
were
rent
by
the
momentary
screeching
and
chatter
of
parroquets
as
they
flew
spreading
the
red
green
and
yellow
of
their
breasts
against
the
blue
sky
at
sunset
and
dawn
there
were
merry
melodious
flutings
long
sweet
carollings
and
bursts
of
husky
gnomish
laughter
yet
the
silence
remained
hovering
and
swallowing
insatiably
every
sound
she
gazed
at
the
wilderness
of
the
trees
about
her
from
the
hill
on
which
the
cow
paddock
was
she
could
see
only
the
clearing
and
trees
trees
standing
in
a
green
and
undulating
sea
in
every
direction
clothing
the
hills
so
that
they
seemed
no
more
than
a
dark
moss
clinging
close
to
their
sides
in
the
distance
they
took
on
all
the
misty
shades
of
grey
and
blue
or
stood
purple
steeped
in
shadows
under
a
rain
cloud
she
remembered
how
she
had
wondered
what
their
mystery
contained
for
her
when
she
had
first
seen
them
on
the
edge
of
the
plains
and
she
and
donald
had
set
their
faces
towards
them
she
looked
down
on
the
child
in
her
arms
and
realised
that
they
had
brought
him
to
her
from
him
her
eyes
went
to
the
brown
roof
of
the
hut
with
its
back
to
the
hillside
a
thread
of
smoke
curling
from
its
brown
and
grey
chimney
and
to
the
stretches
of
dark
upturned
earth
before
it
they
had
brought
her
this
too
all
the
dear
homeness
of
it
and
a
sense
of
peace
and
consolation
filled
her
heart
to
throw
off
the
spell
of
the
silence
she
decided
that
she
must
work
again
but
what
to
do
donald
had
said
no
fires
were
to
be
lit
in
the
stumps
because
the
smoke
might
attract
wayfarers
on
the
road
or
wandering
natives
to
the
clearing
she
sang
to
the
child
fitfully
softly
then
remembering
the
spinning
wheel
which
stood
in
its
muffling
cloths
against
the
wall
in
the
hut
she
brought
it
into
the
sunshine
and
laid
davey
down
on
a
shawl
at
her
feet
when
she
had
a
slender
thread
of
yarn
going
and
the
spinning
wheel
began
its
familiar
communicative
little
her
mind
was
set
to
old
themes
she
forgot
place
and
time
as
her
fingers
pursued
their
familiar
track
a
gay
little
air
went
fluttering
over
her
lips
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
wheel
and
the
little
tap
tapping
of
its
treadles
she
glanced
at
the
child
every
now
and
then
laughing
and
telling
him
that
his
mother
had
found
the
wherewithal
to
keep
her
busy
and
gay
as
a
bonny
baby
mother
ought
to
be
and
that
the
song
she
was
singing
was
a
song
that
the
women
sang
over
their
spinning
wheels
in
the
dear
country
that
she
had
come
from
far
across
the
sea
but
the
shadows
fell
quickly
the
birds
were
calling
long
and
warningly
when
she
carried
the
wheel
indoors
and
busied
herself
for
the
evening
milking
wherever
she
went
the
dog
that
had
come
from
the
port
with
them
followed
he
trailed
in
her
footsteps
when
she
went
to
the
creek
for
water
or
to
the
cow
paddock
he
lay
with
watchful
eyes
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
when
she
sat
at
her
spinning
in
the
afternoon
or
walked
backwards
and
forwards
crooning
davey
to
sleep
at
about
noon
on
the
fourth
day
while
she
was
making
porridge
for
her
midday
meal
the
dog
started
to
his
feet
and
barked
furiously
he
had
been
lying
stretched
on
the
mat
in
the
doorway
for
a
moment
her
heart
stood
still
then
she
went
to
the
door
what
is
it
jo
she
asked
the
dog
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
trees
and
scrubby
undergrowth
to
the
left
of
the
hut
every
short
hair
on
his
lean
body
bristled
he
growled
sullenly
later
in
the
afternoon
when
she
sat
in
the
clearing
spinning
and
singing
with
davey
on
his
shawl
beside
her
he
started
to
his
feet
suddenly
and
snarled
fiercely
mary
looked
at
him
again
questioningly
and
her
eyes
flew
to
the
edge
of
the
trees
in
the
direction
he
pointed
no
quivering
leaf
nor
threatening
sound
stirred
the
quiet
he
subsided
at
her
feet
after
a
moment
but
his
ears
kept
pricked
twitched
uneasily
his
eyes
never
left
the
edge
of
the
trees
once
they
twisted
up
to
her
and
she
read
in
them
the
clear
expression
of
a
pitiful
uneasiness
the
assurance
of
deathless
fidelity
a
prayer
almost
to
go
into
the
house
she
picked
up
the
child
and
walked
towards
the
hut
the
dog
followed
glancing
uneasily
towards
the
edge
of
the
clearing
she
shut
the
door
on
that
side
of
the
hut
and
went
to
the
back
door
jo
jo
she
called
long
and
clearly
he
flew
round
to
her
though
her
limbs
trembled
mary
went
up
to
the
paddock
and
brought
the
cow
down
to
the
shed
she
milked
with
davey
on
her
knees
and
the
dog
crouched
beside
her
then
with
the
child
on
one
arm
and
the
milk
pail
on
the
other
she
went
towards
the
house
again
she
did
not
go
down
to
the
creek
for
water
as
she
usually
did
it
not
because
i
afraid
davey
she
murmured
but
jo
would
not
have
barked
like
that
for
nothing
it
was
a
warning
and
it
would
not
be
nice
of
us
to
take
no
notice
of
him
at
all
as
she
left
the
shed
the
dog
darted
savagely
away
she
did
not
notice
that
he
was
no
longer
at
her
heels
until
she
had
the
hut
as
she
was
going
to
call
him
the
words
died
on
her
lips
two
gaunt
and
ragged
men
stood
in
the
doorway
chapter
iv
mary
stood
back
from
the
threshold
the
fear
that
had
haunted
her
for
days
had
suddenly
left
her
at
first
glance
she
had
seen
that
the
men
had
rough
pieces
of
wood
in
their
hands
her
gaze
was
arrested
by
the
taller
shaggier
man
who
had
sprung
forward
he
was
about
to
speak
roughly
breathlessly
but
she
anticipated
him
her
eyes
flew
past
him
to
the
man
who
hung
in
his
shadow
the
gash
of
a
wound
was
just
visible
under
a
grimy
piece
of
rag
wrapped
across
his
forehead
he
hurt
she
cried
a
sure
instinct
of
protection
urging
her
come
in
and
i
bind
up
your
head
it
wants
water
and
a
clean
bandage
oh
but
you
look
starving
both
of
you
have
you
lost
your
way
in
the
hills
it
terrible
to
do
that
but
you
welcome
indeed
come
in
and
have
something
to
eat
and
rest
yourselves
the
tall
man
hung
in
the
doorway
as
though
speech
and
reason
had
deserted
him
but
the
other
whose
thatch
of
reddish
hair
stood
up
strangely
from
the
filthy
rag
that
bound
his
forehead
raised
his
arm
and
took
a
step
forward
the
glare
of
madness
in
his
eyes
but
that
movement
was
the
last
spurt
of
energy
in
him
he
pitched
forward
and
lay
across
the
threshold
oh
bring
him
in
and
put
him
on
the
bed
there
and
i
try
and
do
something
for
him
mary
cried
her
eyes
flying
from
the
fallen
body
to
the
man
who
stood
in
the
doorway
he
did
as
she
asked
and
turned
to
her
with
watchful
eyes
you
hold
the
child
for
me
while
i
bathe
his
head
she
said
it
may
bring
him
to
she
thrust
davey
into
his
arms
sit
down
wo
you
she
asked
smiling
towards
him
as
she
set
some
water
on
the
fire
and
poured
some
more
into
a
basin
she
tore
up
a
piece
of
old
linen
and
began
very
gently
to
bathe
the
unconscious
man
head
he
groaned
as
the
pain
stirred
again
she
spoke
to
him
saying
that
the
wound
would
mend
the
sooner
for
being
cleansed
and
that
it
was
a
wonder
he
was
alive
at
all
with
the
state
it
was
in
sitting
in
donald
chair
holding
davey
in
his
arms
tightly
clumsily
the
tall
man
watched
her
his
face
turned
to
and
from
her
as
his
eyes
wandered
apprehensively
about
the
hut
and
to
the
door
here
he
said
at
last
snarling
over
the
words
where
your
man
i
no
notion
for
him
to
come
in
and
corner
us
if
that
your
game
he
away
she
replied
and
will
not
be
back
perhaps
for
a
day
or
two
he
stared
at
her
i
should
never
have
thought
davey
would
be
so
good
with
a
stranger
she
added
her
eyes
travelling
from
davey
round
head
on
his
arm
to
the
man
dark
face
and
the
eyes
that
leapt
and
glittered
in
it
she
smiled
into
them
davey
was
crooning
and
gurgling
he
had
crooked
his
little
hands
into
the
stranger
beard
and
his
mother
saw
with
joy
that
the
stranger
held
his
head
as
though
he
feared
to
dislodge
those
little
hands
no
games
he
growled
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
desperate
men
it
our
lives
we
fighting
for
i
knew
that
when
i
saw
you
she
said
quietly
she
put
some
bread
on
the
table
a
mug
of
milk
and
a
piece
of
cold
meat
it
is
not
much
to
offer
you
but
it
is
all
i
got
she
said
i
wish
it
were
better
because
you
wanting
good
wholesome
food
just
now
i
make
some
gruel
for
your
friend
and
maybe
there
be
an
egg
or
i
can
set
snares
for
a
she
took
davey
from
him
and
he
turned
to
the
table
to
eat
the
man
on
the
bed
moaned
wearily
she
put
davey
into
his
basket
lined
with
furry
skins
and
went
to
the
sick
man
the
cloths
that
she
had
put
over
it
to
soak
off
the
filthy
rag
which
bound
his
head
had
served
their
purpose
she
lifted
them
and
the
festering
gash
on
his
forehead
was
laid
bare
her
exclamation
or
a
twinge
of
pain
as
the
air
touched
the
wound
sharpened
his
brain
his
eyes
opened
he
stared
with
gaze
a
moment
then
with
a
hoarse
oath
he
sprang
at
her
his
quivering
lean
fingers
gripped
her
throat
and
clung
tenaciously
the
man
at
the
table
flung
himself
upon
him
and
wrenched
his
hands
away
they
struggled
for
a
moment
then
the
sick
man
dropped
on
to
the
bed
again
but
he
shouted
incoherently
his
eyes
baleful
by
the
flickering
firelight
after
the
gaols
the
sea
the
bush
to
be
taken
now
and
like
this
by
god
he
panted
let
me
be
let
me
be
do
you
see
it
a
trap
it
all
right
the
other
gasped
do
let
your
tongue
run
away
with
you
steve
i
not
be
taken
alive
the
man
on
the
bed
cried
not
now
not
after
getting
through
so
far
i
not
be
taken
alive
the
one
that
tries
to
take
me
not
live
either
the
tall
man
cursed
beneath
his
breath
the
woman
means
no
harm
to
you
he
said
it
is
the
fever
troubling
him
mary
explained
the
sick
man
was
already
weak
again
he
lay
on
the
bed
limply
and
muttering
uneasily
you
best
hold
him
so
as
i
can
put
on
the
clean
rags
she
said
she
had
a
length
of
old
linen
smeared
with
ointment
from
a
small
earthenware
jar
in
her
hands
she
laid
it
over
the
wound
and
gently
and
firmly
bound
it
into
place
that
be
better
she
murmured
the
gaunt
man
overlooked
her
a
curious
cynical
humour
in
his
eyes
you
a
brave
woman
he
said
i
not
indeed
she
replied
but
her
eyes
met
his
squarely
she
laughed
softly
and
told
him
how
afraid
she
had
been
earlier
in
the
day
at
the
sound
of
his
mother
voice
davey
piped
wistfully
she
went
over
to
him
and
rocked
his
cradle
for
a
moment
or
two
hush
davey
she
said
talking
to
him
softly
in
her
native
welsh
we
have
company
there
one
hungry
man
wants
his
supper
and
another
man
sick
that
thy
mother
must
make
gruel
for
do
thou
sing
to
thyself
son
till
mother
is
ready
to
take
thee
again
but
davey
had
no
great
notion
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
that
separated
him
from
the
source
of
all
consolation
he
wailed
incontinently
and
from
wailing
took
to
uttering
his
protest
with
all
the
strength
that
was
in
him
the
unkempt
stranger
munching
his
dry
bread
by
the
table
glanced
furtively
at
mary
back
as
she
stooped
over
the
fire
stirring
the
gruel
then
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
cradle
he
lifted
the
child
with
awkward
carefulness
davey
continued
to
wail
nevertheless
finding
that
it
was
not
the
soft
covering
of
his
mother
breast
that
he
was
laid
against
but
a
harsh
fabric
smelling
of
the
sea
the
earth
dank
leaves
and
a
strange
personality
when
she
took
the
gruel
from
the
fire
and
poured
it
into
a
little
bowl
her
eyes
rested
on
the
stranger
as
he
tried
to
appease
davey
he
was
cradling
the
child
in
his
arms
and
muttering
awkwardly
distressfully
there
now
there
an
expression
of
awe
and
reflectiveness
veiled
the
sharpness
of
his
features
there
now
there
then
he
kept
saying
he
looked
up
to
find
davey
mother
eyes
resting
on
him
and
laughed
a
little
shamefacedly
i
think
he
forgetting
his
company
manners
surely
he
said
you
the
first
company
he
had
to
practise
on
she
replied
her
simplicity
and
again
the
clear
shining
eyes
with
their
direct
and
smiling
glance
astounded
him
you
best
give
this
to
your
friend
yourself
she
went
on
putting
the
bowl
on
the
table
it
seems
to
trouble
him
to
see
a
strange
face
she
lifted
davey
from
the
stranger
arms
and
he
took
the
bowl
of
gruel
to
the
other
man
be
gentle
with
him
and
humour
him
she
warned
but
make
him
eat
all
of
it
i
put
a
blanket
here
on
the
hearth
for
you
and
davey
and
i
will
sleep
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
when
she
had
thrown
all
the
spare
clothing
in
the
hut
on
the
floor
before
the
fire
and
had
spread
a
patchwork
quilt
and
the
rug
of
skins
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
for
herself
she
sat
down
on
a
low
stool
near
the
door
and
lifted
davey
lips
to
her
breast
she
sang
a
lullaby
rocking
him
in
her
arms
his
cries
ceased
her
thoughts
went
off
into
a
dreamy
psalm
of
thanksgiving
as
his
soft
mouth
pulled
at
her
breast
she
looked
up
to
find
the
eyes
of
the
tall
stranger
on
her
a
gaunt
man
his
clothes
hung
on
his
arms
and
legs
as
if
they
were
the
wooden
limbs
of
a
scarecrow
the
shreds
were
knotted
and
tied
together
and
showed
bare
shrunken
shanks
and
shins
burnt
and
cut
about
the
dark
hair
of
virility
thick
on
them
his
face
lean
and
leathern
had
a
curious
expression
of
hunger
the
eyes
in
it
held
dark
memories
yet
a
glitter
of
the
sun
mary
cameron
vaguely
realised
that
she
had
known
what
manner
of
man
this
was
the
moment
she
looked
into
his
eyes
that
was
why
she
had
not
been
afraid
when
he
confronted
her
on
the
doorstep
why
too
she
had
been
able
to
ask
him
into
her
house
and
treat
him
as
an
unexpected
but
not
unwelcome
guest
the
man
on
the
bed
moaned
suddenly
he
started
up
with
a
shrill
scream
a
wave
a
wave
we
be
swamped
his
voice
fell
away
muttering
then
again
he
was
crying
is
that
the
land
dan
that
line
against
the
sky
over
there
no
y
see
there
there
man
god
do
say
it
is
how
long
have
we
been
in
this
boat

sea

little
blue
waves

my
face

any
longer
the
thirst
and
the
pain
in
me
head
dan
mary
turned
pitiful
eyes
on
him
rocking
davey
and
hushing
him
gently
as
he
wakened
and
began
to
cry
querulously
a
sail
the
sick
man
shouted
some
blasted
clipper
for
the
port
think
she
see
us
dan
are
we
too
far
away
will
the
waves
hide
us
he
sank
back
wearily
muttering
again
i
not
be
caught
not
be
taken
alive
dan
he
started
up
crying
angrily
i
rather
go
to
hell
than
back
a
shriek
that
curdled
the
blood
in
her
veins
a
cry
that
sped
upwards
in
an
uncurling
scream
of
uncontrollable
anguish
flew
from
the
sick
man
another
and
another
mary
looked
at
the
man
before
her
questioningly
the
lines
about
his
nose
were
bent
to
a
faint
and
bitter
smile
but
there
was
no
smile
in
his
eyes
thinks
he
being
flogged
he
said
he
would
be
if
we
were
caught
taken
back
again
you
know
where
we
came
from
yes
she
said
from
the
island
his
head
was
jerked
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
you
the
first
soul
i
spoken
to
since
we
escaped
except
him
and
he
been
raving
mad
most
of
the
time
you
and
i
got
to
do
some
talking
he
looked
about
the
room
lifted
donald
chair
and
set
it
before
her
he
had
recovered
his
was
readjusting
his
plans
yes
she
said
you
know
we
meant
to
get
all
the
food
and
clothes
we
wanted
from
this
hut
he
said
harshly
we
watched
you
all
day
from
the
trees
and
thought
a
man
would
be
coming
home
after
sundown
we
did
mean
to
let
you
off
if
you
screamed
and
brought
him
before
we
got
what
we
wanted
the
dog
dead
did
you
know
i
killed
him
caught
him
by
the
throat
behind
the
shed
but
that
was
a
pity
she
cried
a
note
of
distress
in
her
voice
pity
he
leaned
forward
but
we
ca
afford
to
have
pity
i
saw
you
sitting
spinning
in
the
sun
singing
to
the
child
my
heart
turned
in
me
to
see
you
like
the
women
at
home
but
that
would
not
have
saved
you
starving
men
fighting
for
our
lives
we
were
wild
beasts
pity
what
pity
been
shown
to
us
do
y
know
what
it
means
to
have
felt
the
lash
and
made
your
escape
from
port
arthur
swimming
the
bay
at
neck
wrapped
in
kelp
cheating
the
bloodhounds
chained
a
few
yards
from
each
other
across
the
neck
and
the
sentry
who
shoot
you
like
a
dog
if
he
saw
you
do
y
know
what
it
was
like
crawling
from
one
end
of
the
island
to
the
other
in
the
bush
at
night
with
only
a
native
to
guide
you
not
knowing
whether
he
was
going
to
spear
you
or
run
you
into
the
tribe
making
your
way
in
a
of
a
boat
in
the
open
sea
without
any
mariner
tools
at
all
and
only
a
keg
of
water
and
a
bit
of
skin
to
chew
to
keep
the
life
in
you
no
you
do
know
how
could
you
he
paused
a
moment
and
continued
desperately
and
it
no
good
my
trying
to
tell
you
steve
got
a
crack
on
his
head
the
night
we
escaped
he
was
mad
with
thirst
in
the
boat
i
was
near
it
myself
and
i
had
all
the
work
to
do
pulling
and
straining
my
eyes
for
the
land
we
had
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
other
boats
too
and
the
government
sloop
going
between
port
southern
and
hobart
town
for
fear
we
be
seen
picked
up
and
sent
back
months
of
scheming
it
took
to
get
so
far
i
picked
up
the
lay
of
the
land
near
the
port
and
the
way
to
get
about
in
the
country
beyond
from
sailors
it
was
a
man
who
got
as
far
as
the
coast
and
had
been
sent
back
told
me
to
look
for
the
muddy
in
the
sea
and
get
up
the
river
at
night
we
wanted
to
make
the
wirree
because
there
is
a
man
lives
near
the
river
we
heard
would
give
us
food
and
shelter
or
help
us
to
get
away
to
the
hills
we
got
to
the
river
and
had
to
be
low
in
the
bush
all
day
till
night
came
again
then
i
went
up
through
the
trees
to
a
wooden
house
we
could
see
among
other
houses
that
were
all
mud
or
mud
and
stones
it
was
mcnab
shanty
we
got
a
sailor
to
take
a
letter
through
to
him
saying
we
were
coming
and
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
us
and
i
got
a
message
from
mcnab
telling
us
how
to
get
to
him
what
sort
of
man
he
was
to
look
at
and
saying
he
was
willing
to
help
us
get
away
on
condition
that
when
we
got
on
our
feet
we
make
it
up
to
him
of
course
we
had
to
pay
on
the
spot
too
and
we
got
a
bit
to
do
it
with
i
heard
them
say
on
the
island
he
making
his
fortune
mcnab
they
say
there
are
men
in
this
country
now
well
off
holding
big
positions
who
pay
mcnab
what
he
likes
because
he
helped
them
to
get
away
they
pay
because
if
they
do
no
matter
who
they
are
what
they
doing
a
word
from
him
against
them
and
back
they
go
to
the
darbies
and
the
cells
but
there
a
new
game
now
a
reward
is
out
for
the
capture
of
escaped
convicts
the
weary
bitterness
of
his
voice
took
a
sharper
edge
it
was
a
hot
night
i
lay
low
near
mcnab
waiting
for
the
chance
to
tell
him
we
come
and
get
the
food
and
clothes
he
promised
to
have
ready
for
us
it
was
late
i
waited
until
there
did
seem
anybody
about
the
bar
and
the
lights
went
out
all
but
the
one
in
a
room
at
the
side
then
i
got
tired
of
waiting
and
crept
up
to
the
shanty
and
lay
flat
against
the
wall
hoping
to
see
if
the
way
was
clear
and
i
could
get
a
word
with
mcnab
the
wall
was
not
thick
and
there
was
a
crack
in
it
i
could
see
into
that
room
with
the
light
mcnab
was
there
and
the
trooper
from
port
southern
with
him
under
his
coat
i
could
make
out
his
uniform
a
bottle
of
rum
made
the
talk
go
easy
between
them
and
i
heard
the
plan
they
were
making
it
was
that
should
not
keep
too
close
a
watch
for
from
the
island
be
too
keen
on
their
scent
and
mcnab
should
play
friendly
to
them
and
tell
of
their
whereabouts
when
they
thought
they
were
getting
off
finely
he
was
to
arrest
them
and
the
pair
of
them
would
share
the
reward
steve
and
i
were
expected
we
were
to
be
first
victims
mary
exclamation
of
pity
and
horror
comforted
him
the
compassion
of
her
eyes
banished
the
evil
mirthless
smile
from
his
i
got
back
to
steve
he
said
more
quietly
he
was
almost
too
ill
to
walk
he
understood
though
that
we
would
not
be
troubling
mcnab
when
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
was
quiet
though
he
had
been
moaning
and
crying
all
day
it
was
because
of
his
fever
i
was
afraid
to
leave
him
again
or
to
try
to
get
food
in
the
township
so
we
started
for
the
ranges
but
we
had
gone
far
when
he
gave
out
and
i
had
to
carry
him
i
wanted
to
get
him
away
from
the
tracks
where
the
sound
of
his
raving
could
be
heard
and
so
we
been
in
the
hills
ever
since
nearly
ten
days
it
must
be
this
was
the
first
clearing
we
sighted
since
we
saw
the
wirree
and
we
had
to
get
what
we
could
out
of
it
or
die
in
our
tracks
i
talking
sane
enough
now
but
i
was
almost
as
mad
as
steve
with
hunger
and
rage
at
the
thought
of
being
taken
again
and
serving
to
get
reward
money
for
mcnab
when
we
came
to
the
door
here
he
hesitated
it
was
the
sight
of
you
looking
like
the
mother
of
god
with
the
child
in
your
arms
saved
me
i
give
you
all
the
food
and
clothes
i
can
she
said
his
voice
trembled
then
he
said
roughly
you
not
playing
the
thad
mcnab
game
her
eyes
met
his
do
you
think
so
she
asked
davey
and
i
a
fine
pair
we
are
to
play
a
game
with
you
you
think
it
the
easiest
way
to
get
rid
of
us
to
give
us
what
we
ask
for
she
nodded
smiling
you
are
afraid
then
not
for
myself
but
for
you
there
was
no
wavering
in
her
eyes
i
was
not
wanting
my
husband
to
find
you
here
he
might
think
it
was
his
duty
to
send
word
back
to
the
port
he
might
he
try
yes
he
try
but
you
got
a
sick
man
to
think
of
and
you
at
the
end
of
your
strength
yourself
donald
a
strong
man
and
he
has
no
love
for
desperate
characters
a
flickering
smile
played
about
her
mouth
you
must
be
gone
before
he
returns
you
can
rest
here
and
then
you
would
be
better
going
you
can
read
the
stick
by
the
door
the
cross
marks
the
day
he
went
it
will
be
five
days
since
then
and
he
may
be
back
on
the
sixth
or
the
seventh
day
the
man
looked
from
her
to
the
sapling
pole
by
the
door
counted
the
notches
on
it
and
his
eyes
returned
to
her
you
heard
naught
good
of
convicts
that
you
should
be
treating
me
so
he
said
no
it
terrible
tales
i
heard
of
the
things
they
do
and
the
things
that
are
done
to
them
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
her
face
none
too
terrible
for
the
truth
he
said
they
tell
me
it
was
a
man
in
melbourne
told
me
it
is
the
life
makes
them
desperate
she
cried
men
who
have
been
sent
out
for
quite
little
things
become
dead
to
shame
he
said
men
who
would
kill
a
woman
who
has
served
them
as
you
have
served
us
for
fear
when
they
gone
she
would
betray
them
send
her
men
and
the
black
bloodhounds
after
them
condemn
them
to
hell
and
torture
again
oh
women
have
done
it
and
men
like
me
have
made
other
women
pay
a
gleam
of
anger
lighted
mary
cameron
eyes
if
you
believe
i
would
give
them
the
chance
of
taking
you
back
again
there
is
donald
gun
on
the
shelf
she
said
settle
the
matter
for
yourself
but
if
you
will
believe
the
truth
it
is
this
my
heart
is
with
you
and
all
like
you
the
sick
man
muttered
and
cried
davey
waking
wailed
fretfully
we
go
the
stranger
said
you
give
us
food
and
clothing
yes
she
replied
a
little
wearily
but
will
you
not
rest
now
i
must
be
sleeping
myself
because
the
child
will
be
ill
if
i
not
careful
of
him
the
man
stood
before
her
abashed
his
face
working
as
though
he
were
restraining
the
desire
to
cry
as
davey
was
crying
i
ca
understand
why
you
should
be
as
you
are
he
said
at
length
his
voice
breaking
ah
there
reason
enough
she
sighed
and
turned
away
from
him
he
threw
himself
down
before
the
fire
but
mary
did
not
sleep
when
she
lay
on
the
floor
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
although
the
regular
breathing
of
her
guest
told
her
when
he
slept
once
she
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
where
he
lay
stretched
before
the
fire
as
he
had
thrown
himself
in
an
attitude
of
utter
exhaustion
the
rambling
cries
and
the
moaning
of
the
man
on
the
bed
kept
her
awake
she
found
herself
listening
to
the
tangled
threads
of
his
raving
the
firelight
leapt
in
long
beams
across
the
room
there
was
no
fear
but
a
strange
awe
in
her
heart
chapter
v
in
the
morning
the
tall
man
eyes
followed
mary
as
she
went
about
the
work
of
her
house
as
though
he
were
dreaming
he
watched
her
break
dry
branches
and
sticks
for
the
fire
across
her
knee
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
offer
to
break
them
for
her
and
he
fetched
an
armful
of
wood
from
the
stack
in
the
yard
he
gazed
as
if
it
were
strange
and
wonderful
to
see
a
woman
washing
dishes
sweeping
and
cooking
at
her
own
hearth
he
saw
her
and
bail
the
cow
lead
the
cow
and
calf
to
the
fenced
paddock
on
the
top
of
the
hill
after
the
milking
and
carry
buckets
of
water
from
the
creek
to
the
house
the
sunlight
touching
her
bare
head
and
flashing
from
the
water
in
her
pails
mary
did
everything
in
a
serene
methodical
way
going
from
one
task
to
another
as
though
she
were
happy
in
each
and
in
no
hurry
to
be
done
with
it
he
heard
her
calling
to
the
fowls
as
she
threw
a
handful
of
crumbs
to
them
and
seeing
that
he
was
watching
she
told
him
smiling
a
little
that
the
matronly
buff
hen
mother
bunch
was
a
very
good
hen
indeed
laying
every
day
except
sunday
in
the
summer
and
spring
time
and
that
the
smart
pullet
was
no
good
at
all
for
laying
she
gives
us
a
little
brown
egg
now
and
then
mary
said
and
makes
such
a
fuss
about
it
that
why
i
call
her
fanny
she
is
so
like
miss
fanny
at
home
who
could
not
sew
at
all
well
but
when
she
made
a
dress
that
a
woman
could
wear
all
the
countryside
knew
about
it
he
she
indicated
the
lordly
rooster
is
called
the
meester
that
is
the
master
in
english
a
smile
showed
in
the
man
sombre
eyes
early
in
the
morning
she
had
given
him
a
bowl
of
porridge
and
had
eaten
some
herself
a
bowl
containing
porridge
for
steve
when
he
wakened
was
set
by
the
hearth
the
house
was
in
order
davey
bathed
and
put
in
his
basket
in
the
sun
and
mary
was
making
bread
of
the
little
flour
and
meal
left
in
the
bags
when
steve
awoke
he
sat
up
on
the
bed
and
looked
uneasily
about
the
room
he
was
a
frail
creature
the
fever
had
left
him
but
there
were
apprehension
and
desperate
fear
in
his
eyes
as
with
a
quickened
light
they
rested
on
her
he
awake
mary
called
softly
to
the
man
out
of
doors
he
sprang
across
the
threshold
it
all
right
steve
he
said
this
woman
a
friend
she
had
stooped
to
the
hearth
and
lifted
the
bowl
of
porridge
steve
ate
like
a
hungry
dog
tearing
at
the
bread
and
thrusting
large
spoonfuls
of
porridge
into
his
mouth
mary
gave
him
a
cup
of
hot
milk
he
swallowed
it
at
once
and
coughed
and
swore
as
it
scalded
his
throat
if
you
could
see
what
you
can
do
for
us
in
the
way
of
clothes
his
companion
said
we
be
moving
on
her
eyes
were
troubled
if
harm
came
of
my
helping
you
she
began
if
innocent
blood
were
shed
he
said
there
was
bitterness
in
his
voice
you
like
the
rest
of
them
good
bad
or
indifferent
you
herd
us
all
together
convicts
if
you
mean
his
eyes
sought
hers
if
you
mean
you
afraid
that
instead
of
helping
to
give
a
man
another
chance
for
his
life
you
may
be
helping
a
wolf
to
harry
the
lambs
you
making
a
mistake
i
swear
by
all
i
hold
sacred
you
not
repent
of
what
you
have
done
for
me
mary
smiled
her
tension
of
spirit
relieved
i
believe
you
she
said
simply
she
took
donald
working
clothes
from
the
pegs
where
they
hung
behind
the
door
they
were
worn
but
whole
from
the
heavy
that
stood
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
she
took
a
grey
flannel
shirt
also
one
of
unbleached
calico
and
a
pair
of
dingy
black
trousers
then
she
brought
a
pair
of
broken
boots
and
a
torn
felt
hat
from
the
shed
where
the
plough
and
tools
were
kept
there
only
one
hat
and
i
have
to
stitch
it
for
you
she
said
but
he
with
a
glance
at
steve
who
had
fallen
asleep
again
on
the
bed
he
wo
have
need
of
a
hat
for
awhile
with
that
bandage
on
his
head
and
when
the
cut
is
healed
you
had
better
give
him
this
one
to
wear
and
you
will
be
able
to
say
you
have
lost
yours
the
tall
man
glanced
from
donald
heavy
boots
to
steve
bruised
and
blackened
feet
you
had
better
put
on
those
yourself
mary
said
following
his
glance
perhaps
he
could
wear
mine
she
sat
down
and
took
off
her
shoes
while
he
measured
her
shoe
against
steve
foot
she
slipped
her
feet
into
a
broken
pair
of
covers
clamped
with
nails
that
donald
had
made
they
will
be
right
for
him
he
said
i
waken
him
now
and
we
get
on
our
way
she
took
the
bread
that
had
been
browning
on
the
hearth
stones
and
put
it
on
the
table
the
hut
was
filled
with
the
warm
sweet
smell
of
the
loaves
you
can
change
in
here
while
i
put
davey
to
sleep
outside
she
said
and
there
a
pail
of
water
and
soap
there
by
the
doorway
it
will
do
you
no
harm
to
dowse
with
it
the
tall
man
laughed
it
was
a
boyish
burst
that
laugh
of
his
the
piece
of
advice
womanly
in
its
essence
and
delivered
with
an
air
of
maternal
solicitude
touched
a
forgotten
of
merriment
mary
lifted
davey
into
her
arms
and
sang
to
him
softly
as
she
walked
up
and
down
in
the
sunshine
a
long
straggling
figure
came
to
her
a
few
moments
later
clad
in
donald
clothes
she
smiled
to
see
the
way
they
hung
short
of
his
ankles
hitched
over
the
long
thin
legs
but
the
dowsing
of
creek
water
had
done
more
than
cleanse
his
body
in
an
indefinable
way
it
had
purified
and
stimulated
the
inner
man
he
had
found
donald
shears
too
and
had
clipped
the
shaggy
growth
about
his
chin
to
a
modest
beard
and
shorn
his
head
of
some
of
its
shock
of
hair
you
have
the
air
of
a
daffy
young
englishman
just
arrived
in
the
colonies
to
make
your
fortune
she
said
is
that
what
i
am
there
was
a
blithe
recklessness
in
his
voice
he
swept
her
the
bow
that
was
considered
gallant
in
the
old
country
steve
appeared
in
the
doorway
are
you
going
now
she
asked
he
nodded
but
i
must
give
you
some
bread
and
milk
to
take
with
you
she
said
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
strike
middleton
it
was
there
i
was
thinking
you
might
make
for
at
first
it
across
the
ranges
to
the
east
if
you
follow
the
track
across
the
clearing
you
will
find
a
stock
route
you
only
to
keep
along
that
and
it
will
bring
you
to
the
station
it
four
or
five
days
journey
from
here
i
think
and
maybe
there
be
a
job
with
cattle
there
drovers
are
being
wanted
everywhere
they
were
when
we
came
up
from
the
port
nearly
a
year
ago
yes
he
said
we
heard
in
the
island
that
every
man
in
the
wanting
to
be
and
that
the
ca
get
beasts
to
the
market
they
running
off
wild
where
the
stockmen
have
left
them
we
want
any
job
that
bring
food
and
money
to
begin
with
and
they
say
men
with
cattle
are
not
making
too
particular
inquiries
as
to
whose
doing
their
drovin
so
long
as
it
done
she
put
davey
in
his
basket
and
went
back
to
the
hut
when
she
reappeared
it
was
with
some
bread
and
a
bottle
of
milk
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
bagging
you
have
no
trouble
about
water
because
there
are
creeks
all
through
the
hills
she
said
as
she
put
the
bundle
into
his
hand
steve
had
gone
off
without
speaking
to
her
he
was
slouching
towards
the
trees
the
tall
man
took
the
food
from
her
their
eyes
met
have
i
ever
seen
you
before
i
seem
to
know
you
she
asked
distress
on
her
face
pray
god
not
he
said
what
is
your
name
you
better
not
know
for
a
moment
in
a
storm
of
gratitude
and
emotion
his
mind
trembled
on
the
verge
of
his
face
worked
uncertainly
i
can
not
say
what
i
want
to
he
said
at
last
as
if
restraint
denied
him
almost
any
expression
at
all
this
is
a
debt
if
ever
in
any
way
i
can
repay
i
will
but
there
no
way
of
letting
you
know
what
you
have
done
for
me
for
a
moment
his
eyes
held
hers
then
he
turned
away
and
she
watched
him
stride
across
the
clearing
and
disappear
among
the
trees
chapter
vi
in
her
sleep
mary
heard
the
rumble
and
groan
of
the
wagon
as
it
ground
its
way
along
the
rough
tracks
and
crashed
over
the
undergrowth
she
awakened
to
hear
the
yelping
of
dogs
the
lowing
of
cattle
sounds
of
men
voices
in
the
clearing
for
a
moment
she
believed
that
her
mind
was
still
hovering
in
the
troubled
state
of
dreams
then
donald
voice
calling
her
struck
through
the
drowsy
uncertainty
trembling
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
threw
davey
red
shawl
about
her
shoulders
she
lighted
the
dip
in
a
bowl
of
melted
fat
and
put
it
on
to
the
table
mary
again
his
voice
hoarse
and
impatient
came
from
the
darkness
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
she
pulled
back
the
bolts
and
threw
open
the
door
yes
she
called
donald
loomed
out
of
the
darkness
across
the
clearing
by
the
swinging
light
of
a
lantern
before
the
wagon
she
dimly
saw
its
white
shape
and
the
moving
backs
of
cattle
her
arms
went
out
to
donald
when
he
stood
before
her
where
the
dog
he
asked
dead
she
said
quietly
from
her
eyes
and
her
face
as
she
fell
back
he
learnt
that
something
unusual
had
happened
then
there
has
been
trouble
he
said
she
nodded
he
swept
his
hat
off
with
a
great
sigh
but
you
all
right
you
and
the
bairn
yes
when
the
dog
did
not
fly
out
as
we
got
near
the
house
i
thought
something
had
happened
there
are
tales
in
the
port
of
two
men
from
hobart
town
escaped
convicts
having
taken
to
the
hills
their
boat
was
found
in
the
wirree
i
tried
to
get
back
sooner
fearing
they
might
come
this
way
but
the
roads
were
bad
and
then
there
were
the
cattle
i
have
had
an
easy
minute
since
i
been
away
but
we
can
talk
later
there
a
boy
come
with
me
drivin
the
cattle
i
got
a
mob
cheap
from
a
man
whose
stockmen
had
cleared
out
and
left
them
on
his
hands
get
us
something
to
eat
ready
i
bring
the
wagon
up
to
the
shed
now
you
can
get
what
you
want
from
it
there
corned
meat
and
oatmeal
and
flour
for
a
year
we
put
the
cattle
into
the
fenced
paddock
and
then
come
down
you
can
clear
out
the
wagon
enough
to
put
a
sheepskin
or
two
and
a
blanket
in
it
for
johnson
he
turned
away
and
went
back
into
the
night
mary
threw
more
wood
on
the
fire
as
she
put
on
her
skirt
and
bodice
she
heard
the
wagon
labouring
forward
she
was
out
getting
the
flour
and
bacon
she
wanted
from
it
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
when
with
a
rattling
of
horns
and
a
thunder
of
hoofs
the
cattle
beat
past
her
along
the
track
behind
the
sheds
the
lantern
light
gave
a
vision
of
fierce
bloodshot
eyes
of
terror
in
a
sea
of
tossing
backs
of
moving
flanks
and
branching
horns
she
heard
her
voice
hoarse
and
yelling
the
voice
of
the
strange
youth
and
the
cracking
of
whips
and
yelping
of
dogs
for
nearly
an
hour
afterwards
as
they
tried
to
get
the
beasts
into
the
fenced
paddock
on
the
it
was
nearly
dawn
before
donald
and
the
slight
young
man
he
had
brought
with
him
from
port
southern
had
finished
their
meal
then
the
stockman
went
to
sleep
in
the
wagon
and
donald
cameron
turned
to
his
wife
tell
me
what
happened
he
said
she
did
so
very
simply
they
must
have
been
the
same
men
i
heard
of
in
the
port
he
said
breathing
hard
the
trooper
told
me
about
them
and
that
i
had
best
look
out
for
them
up
here
there
was
no
telling
what
they
might
do
he
said
a
desperate
pair
would
stop
at
nothing
i
am
not
sure
that
i
better
not
send
johnson
back
to
tell
him
that
been
here
and
that
you
would
not
do
that
donald
why
not
his
voice
the
suppressed
rage
of
it
was
a
shock
to
her
a
man
can
not
leave
his
home
in
safety
with
these
sort
of
men
about
and
it
is
the
duty
of
every
honest
man
to
deal
as
he
would
be
dealt
by
you
a
clever
woman
and
no
harm
has
come
to
you
by
them
but
there
are
other
women
who
might
not
be
so
clever
but
they
were
not
bad
men
donald
one
of
them
was
sick
and
the
other
it
would
be
a
good
thing
too
being
new
in
the
district
to
stand
well
with
the
police
he
continued
doggedly
and
if
they
were
here
those
two
they
would
either
make
back
for
the
port
or
the
wirree
or
try
to
get
to
middleton
if
they
on
foot
as
ye
say
they
could
not
go
fast
and
with
horses
could
catch
them
up
in
a
day
or
two
which
way
did
they
go
mary
turned
her
head
away
a
sick
feeling
of
grief
and
disappointment
overcame
her
his
eyes
covered
the
averted
curve
of
her
face
and
the
line
of
her
neck
which
way
did
they
go
he
asked
thickly
donald
she
turned
to
him
i
promised
not
to
send
anyone
after
them
you
know
and
i
know
that
lots
of
men
have
been
sent
out
for
things
that
were
not
crimes
at
all
and
you
know
and
you
will
not
tell
me
he
asked
harshly
as
though
he
had
not
heard
yes
she
cried
he
took
her
by
the
shoulder
his
arm
trembled
i
have
stood
this
sort
of
thing
long
enough
he
said
on
the
ship
and
in
melbourne
it
was
the
same
you
were
always
doing
such
things
feeding
or
giving
your
clothes
to
filthy
ailing
and
whiners
i
have
told
you
you
could
not
afford
to
do
it
no
respectable
woman
can
afford
to
in
a
country
where
every
second
woman
has
the
prison
mark
on
her
show
sympathy
with
lags
and
what
be
said
next
you
a
lag
yourself
and
that
why
your
sympathy
with
them
y
my
wife
the
wife
of
a
decent
man
and
free
settler
i
have
remember
that
and
i
not
have
it
said
of
you
he
threw
her
off
from
him
which
way
did
they
go
keen
and
compelling
the
eyes
those
places
of
his
will
met
hers
it
was
my
word
i
gave
donald
his
wife
said
and
i
ca
tell
you
chapter
vii
in
ten
years
cameron
had
become
the
biggest
clearing
in
the
hills
as
it
was
the
oldest
many
others
had
been
made
and
were
scattered
throughout
the
lower
ranges
overlooking
the
wirree
plains
though
at
great
distances
apart
ten
twelve
and
sometimes
twenty
miles
lying
between
neighbouring
homesteads
the
hut
that
had
been
donald
and
mary
cameron
first
home
had
been
broadened
by
the
addition
of
several
extra
rooms
floors
had
been
put
down
and
a
wide
verandah
spread
out
from
them
every
room
had
a
window
with
four
small
glass
panes
the
verandah
posts
and
doors
had
been
painted
green
and
the
whole
of
the
house
whitewashed
its
bark
roof
had
given
place
to
a
covering
of
slates
there
was
even
a
coin
or
two
of
grey
and
golden
lichen
on
them
and
the
autumn
and
spring
rains
drummed
merrily
on
the
iron
roof
of
the
verandah
creepers
climbed
around
the
stone
chimney
and
the
verandah
clematis
showered
starry
white
blossom
over
the
roof
and
about
the
verandah
post
a
little
garden
from
the
long
green
fields
of
spring
wheat
by
a
fence
of
palings
was
filled
with
bright
flowers
english
marigolds
scarlet
geraniums
pink
yellow
and
blue
larkspurs
and
all
manner
of
herbs
sage
mint
marjoram
and
lemon
thyme
the
narrow
beaten
paths
that
ran
from
the
verandah
to
the
gate
and
round
the
house
were
bordered
with
rosemary
and
in
the
summer
a
long
line
of
hollyhocks
pink
white
and
red
and
red
and
white
waved
tall
and
straight
at
one
side
of
the
house
the
edge
of
the
forest
had
been
distanced
so
far
on
every
side
of
the
clearing
except
one
that
the
trunks
of
the
trees
showed
in
dim
outlines
against
it
the
misty
drifting
leafage
swaying
over
and
across
them
only
on
the
side
on
which
the
track
climbed
uphill
from
the
road
the
trees
still
pressed
against
the
paddock
railings
a
long
white
gate
in
the
fence
where
the
road
stopped
bore
the
name
donald
cameron
had
given
his
place
ayrmuir
it
was
the
name
of
the
estate
he
had
worked
on
in
scotland
when
he
was
a
lad
it
gave
him
no
end
of
satisfaction
to
realise
that
he
was
the
master
of
ayrmuir
and
that
his
acres
were
broader
than
those
of
the
ayrmuir
in
the
old
country
not
only
broader
but
his
to
do
what
he
liked
with
his
property
unencumbered
by
mortgage
or
entail
on
the
cleared
hillsides
about
the
house
crops
of
wheat
barley
and
rye
had
been
sown
an
orchard
climbed
the
slope
on
the
left
behind
the
old
barn
and
the
stables
were
a
row
of
haystacks
the
cowsheds
and
milking
yards
were
a
little
further
away
round
the
haystacks
and
about
the
barn
a
score
of
the
buff
and
progeny
of
mother
bunch
a
few
speckled
chickens
black
and
white
pullets
and
miscellaneous
breeds
of
and
yellow
fowls
scratched
and
pecked
industriously
donald
cameron
farmed
his
land
in
the
careful
fashion
of
the
lowland
scots
there
was
perhaps
here
and
there
a
crooked
line
in
his
fields
and
a
rick
awry
behind
the
barns
but
all
was
neatness
and
order
from
the
beehives
which
stood
with
their
pointed
straw
bonnets
beneath
the
apple
trees
to
the
cowsheds
where
bracken
was
laid
down
every
day
or
two
for
the
cows
to
stand
in
when
they
were
milked
there
was
no
filth
or
squelching
morass
in
his
the
pigs
wandered
over
the
hills
rooting
under
the
tender
grass
scarcely
a
straw
was
allowed
to
stray
between
the
back
of
the
house
and
barns
in
the
the
in
every
shed
and
yard
the
meticulous
precision
and
passion
for
order
which
characterised
all
that
donald
cameron
did
was
maintained
there
were
changes
indoors
as
well
as
out
a
long
straight
kitchen
with
a
bricked
floor
and
small
window
looking
out
on
to
the
yard
had
been
added
to
the
original
home
on
the
east
side
two
rooms
had
been
built
and
a
small
limewashed
shed
behind
the
kitchen
served
for
a
dairy
in
it
on
broad
low
shelves
against
the
wall
the
rows
of
milk
pans
with
milk
setting
in
them
were
ranged
a
small
window
in
the
back
wall
framed
a
square
of
blue
sky
when
cameron
was
making
butter
the
sound
of
the
milk
in
the
churn
the
rumble
and
splash
of
the
curded
cream
could
be
heard
in
the
yard
the
sweet
smell
of
the
new
butter
and
buttermilk
hung
about
the
kitchen
door
ten
years
of
indefatigable
energy
of
clearing
land
breaking
soil
raising
crops
and
rearing
cattle
doing
battle
with
the
wilderness
overcoming
all
the
hardships
and
odds
that
a
pioneer
has
to
struggle
against
had
left
their
mark
on
donald
cameron
every
line
in
his
face
was
ploughed
deep
his
expression
gloomy
and
taciturn
as
of
old
masked
an
internal
concentration
the
bending
of
all
faculties
to
the
one
end
that
occupied
him
always
a
man
of
few
words
as
the
farm
grew
and
its
operations
increased
he
became
more
and
more
silent
talking
only
when
it
was
necessary
and
seldom
for
the
sake
of
companionship
or
mere
social
intercourse
his
mind
was
always
busy
with
the
movements
of
cattle
branding
mustering
breeding
buying
and
selling
prices
possibilities
of
the
market
he
worked
insatiably
he
was
reminded
of
the
flight
of
time
only
by
the
growth
of
his
son
a
gawky
boy
as
soon
as
he
could
walk
davey
had
taken
his
share
in
the
work
of
the
homestead
rounding
up
cows
in
the
early
morning
feeding
fowls
hunting
for
eggs
in
the
ripening
crops
scaring
birds
from
the
ploughed
land
when
seed
was
in
and
cutting
ferns
for
the
cowsheds
and
stables
his
father
was
little
more
than
a
dour
taskmaster
to
the
boy
davey
had
no
memory
of
hearing
him
sing
the
gathering
song
of
the
clan
of
donald
the
black
his
mother
had
taught
him
to
read
and
count
as
she
sat
with
her
spinning
wheel
in
the
little
garden
in
front
of
the
house
or
stitching
by
the
fire
indoors
on
winter
evenings
davey
had
to
sit
near
her
and
spell
out
the
words
slowly
from
the
bible
or
the
only
other
book
she
had
a
shabby
little
red
history
sometimes
when
he
was
tired
of
reading
or
the
click
and
purr
of
her
wheel
set
her
mind
wandering
she
told
him
stories
of
the
country
over
the
sea
where
she
was
born
davey
knew
that
the
song
she
sang
sometimes
when
she
was
spinning
was
a
song
a
fairy
had
taught
a
welshwoman
long
ago
so
that
her
spinning
would
go
well
and
quickly
she
told
him
stories
of
the
tylwyth
teg
the
little
brown
welsh
fairies
there
was
one
he
was
never
tired
of
hearing
tell
me
about
the
farmer
boy
who
married
the
fairy
mother
he
would
say
eagerly
and
she
would
tell
him
the
story
she
had
heard
when
she
was
a
child
once
upon
a
time
she
would
say
ever
so
long
ago
there
was
a
farmer
boy
who
minded
his
father
sheep
on
a
wild
lonely
mountain
side
not
a
mountain
side
like
any
we
see
in
this
country
davey
dear
but
bare
and
dark
with
great
rocks
on
it
and
one
day
when
he
was
all
alone
up
there
he
saw
a
girl
looking
at
him
from
round
a
rock
her
hair
was
so
dark
that
it
seemed
part
of
the
rock
and
her
face
was
like
one
of
the
little
flowers
that
grow
on
the
mountain
side
but
he
knew
that
it
was
not
a
flower
face
because
there
were
eyes
in
it
bright
dark
eyes
and
a
mouth
on
it
a
little
red
mouth
with
tiny
white
teeth
behind
it
they
played
on
the
mountain
together
for
a
long
time
and
sometimes
she
helped
him
to
drive
his
sheep
after
a
while
they
got
so
fond
of
each
other
that
the
boy
asked
her
to
go
home
with
him
to
his
father
house
and
he
told
his
father
that
he
wanted
to
marry
her
that
night
a
lot
of
little
men
riding
on
grey
horses
came
down
from
the
mountain
on
a
path
of
moonlight
and
clattered
into
the
farmyard
of
the
farmer
of
ystrad
the
smallest
and
fattest
of
the
men
in
a
red
coat
they
all
wore
red
coats
and
rode
grey
horses
did
i
say
that
they
all
rode
grey
horses
davey
yes
mother
davey
breathed
she
had
this
irritating
little
way
of
going
back
a
word
or
two
on
her
story
if
a
thread
caught
on
her
wheel
well
she
began
again
and
as
likely
as
not
her
mind
taken
up
with
the
tangled
thread
would
add
where
was
i
davey
and
davey
all
impatience
for
her
to
go
on
with
the
story
though
he
could
have
almost
told
it
himself
would
say
and
the
smallest
and
fattest
of
the
men
in
a
red
coat
oh
yes
mary
started
again
strode
into
the
kitchen
and
pinched
the
farmer
ear
and
said
that
he
was
penelop
father
the
girl
name
was
penelop
and
that
he
would
let
her
marry
the
farmer
son
and
give
her
a
dowry
of
health
wealth
and
happiness
on
condition
that
nobody
ever
touched
her
with
a
piece
of
iron
if
anybody
put
a
piece
of
iron
on
her
penelop
father
said
she
would
fly
back
to
the
mountain
and
her
own
people
and
never
more
sit
by
her
husband
hearth
and
churn
or
spin
for
him
so
the
farmer
boy
married
penelop
and
very
happily
they
lived
together
everything
on
the
farm
prospered
because
of
the
fairy
wife
though
she
wore
a
red
petticoat
and
was
like
any
other
woman
to
look
at
only
more
beautiful
and
always
busy
and
merry
she
made
fine
soup
and
cheese
and
her
spinning
was
always
good
and
everybody
was
very
fond
of
her
then
one
day
when
her
husband
wanted
to
go
to
a
fair
she
ran
into
the
fields
to
help
him
to
catch
his
pony
and
while
he
was
throwing
the
bridle
the
iron
struck
her
arm
and
that
minute
she
vanished
into
the
air
before
his
eyes
she
paused
for
davey
exclamation
of
wonderment
and
then
continued
though
he
wandered
all
over
the
mountain
calling
her
penelop
never
came
back
to
her
husband
or
the
two
little
children
she
had
left
with
him
but
one
very
cold
night
in
the
winter
he
wakened
out
of
his
sleep
to
hear
her
saying
outside
in
the
wind
and
rain
lest
my
son
should
find
it
cold
place
on
him
his
father
coat
lest
the
fair
one
find
it
cold
place
on
her
my
petticoat
mary
sang
the
words
to
a
quaint
little
air
of
her
own
making
while
davey
listened
and
when
the
children
grew
up
they
had
dark
hair
and
bright
sparkling
eyes
like
their
mother
she
would
conclude
smiling
at
him
and
when
they
had
children
they
were
like
them
too
so
that
people
who
came
from
the
valley
where
the
farmer
boy
had
married
the
fairy
were
always
known
by
their
looks
and
they
were
called
pellings
or
the
children
of
penelop
because
it
was
said
they
had
fairy
blood
in
their
veins
davey
had
always
a
thousand
questions
to
ask
he
liked
to
brood
over
the
story
but
he
learnt
more
than
fairy
tales
from
his
mother
memories
of
the
old
land
her
mind
was
beginning
to
be
occupied
with
thoughts
of
his
future
she
and
her
husband
were
simple
folk
cameron
could
barely
read
and
write
and
what
little
knowledge
mary
possessed
she
had
already
passed
on
to
davey
she
knew
what
donald
cameron
ambitions
were
and
after
ten
years
of
life
with
him
had
little
doubt
as
to
their
achievement
the
position
that
it
would
put
davey
in
had
begun
to
be
a
matter
of
concern
to
her
she
was
turning
over
in
her
mind
her
plans
for
his
getting
a
good
education
as
she
sat
spinning
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
kitchen
one
evening
when
her
husband
said
suddenly
i
wish
to
goodness
you
put
that
clacking
thing
away
have
done
with
it
now
my
wheel
she
asked
mild
surprise
in
her
eyes
aye
he
said
impatiently
he
was
sitting
in
his
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
do
you
realise
woman
it
not
the
thing
for
cameron
of
ayrmuir
to
be
doing
do
you
realise
y
a
person
of
importance
now
the
lady
of
the
countryside
if
it
comes
to
that
and
for
you
to
sit
there
tapping
and
clacking
that
thing
is
as
good
as
telling
everybody
y
were
a
wench
had
to
twist
up
wool
for
a
living
a
few
years
ago
she
stared
at
him
he
shifted
his
seat
uneasily
i
been
thinking
he
continued
it
no
good
having
made
the
name
and
the
money
unless
we
live
up
to
it
you
must
get
a
girl
to
help
with
the
work
of
the
house
and
we
not
sit
in
here
any
more
in
the
evening
but
in
the
front
room
and
have
our
meals
there
but
the
new
carpet
that
laid
down
and
the
new
furniture
donald
she
exclaimed
they
not
there
to
be
looked
at
are
they
he
asked
last
spring
sales
they
were
calling
me
of
ayrmuir
i
cleared
near
on
a
thousand
pounds
i
not
wanting
to
be
flash
and
throw
away
money
he
added
hastily
but
that
to
show
you
we
can
and
are
going
to
live
something
the
way
they
did
at
ayrmuir
in
the
old
country
she
rose
and
lifted
the
spinning
wheel
from
its
place
by
the
fire
it
was
like
putting
an
old
and
tried
friend
from
her
but
when
she
sat
down
on
her
chair
opposite
donald
cameron
again
there
was
a
new
steady
light
in
her
eyes
you
be
a
rich
man
indeed
donald
if
you
go
on
as
you
are
doing
she
said
aye
he
gazed
before
him
smoking
thoughtfully
and
your
son
will
be
a
rich
man
after
you
aye
well
you
must
have
him
properly
educated
for
the
position
he
is
going
to
have
she
came
steadily
to
her
point
all
your
money
wo
be
any
use
to
him
it
will
only
make
him
ashamed
to
go
where
the
money
could
take
him
unless
he
has
got
the
education
to
hold
his
own
her
eyes
drew
his
from
their
contemplation
of
the
fireplace
and
the
falling
embers
you
the
book
learning
why
ca
you
give
it
to
him
he
said
i
have
given
him
as
much
as
i
can
she
sighed
but
it
little
enough
i
not
such
a
fine
scholar
as
you
think
donald
there
are
things
in
those
books
that
you
brought
from
the
port
in
the
sale
lot
with
the
and
the
that
i
can
not
make
head
nor
tail
of
though
the
i
read
say
that
knowledge
of
the
contents
is
essential
to
a
liberal
education
she
pronounced
the
words
slowly
and
carefully
donald
cameron
frowned
he
did
not
exactly
know
what
she
was
driving
at
but
those
words
sounded
important
i
been
thinking
mary
went
on
quickly
there
a
good
many
people
about
here
now
and
they
ought
to
be
getting
their
children
educated
too
there
the
morrisons
mackays
rosses
and
and
there
a
child
at
the
new
shanty
on
the
top
of
the
track
ross
was
telling
me
last
time
she
was
here
between
the
lot
of
us
we
ought
to
be
able
to
put
up
a
school
and
get
a
teacher
a
barn
on
the
road
would
do
for
a
school
in
other
parts
of
the
country
the
people
are
getting
up
schools
the
newspaper
you
brought
from
port
southern
last
sales
said
that
why
should
not
we
and
where
will
you
get
teacher
cameron
asked
grimly
her
colour
rose
i
know
what
you
mean
she
said
the
only
sort
of
men
who
could
and
would
think
it
worth
while
giving
school
to
children
are
the
convicts
and
men
but
there
are
decent
men
among
them
they
seem
to
be
doing
very
well
in
other
places
i
see
that
mothers
are
going
to
the
and
sitting
there
doing
their
sewing
so
that
they
can
be
sure
the
children
are
learning
no
harm
with
their
lessons
we
could
not
do
that
every
day
here
but
now
and
then
one
of
us
mothers
could
go
to
see
that
the
school
was
going
on
well
anyway
the
children
must
be
taught
and
we
got
to
make
the
best
bargain
we
can
i
think
of
what
you
say
her
husband
replied
you
be
going
to
the
clearwater
river
and
be
away
a
day
or
two
wo
you
she
asked
i
might
take
the
cart
and
lass
and
go
and
see
what
ross
and
martha
morrison
and
mackay
think
of
getting
a
school
if
people
about
are
willing
donald
cameron
said
brooding
over
his
pipe
it
be
a
good
thing
for
all
of
us
a
school
the
difficulty
i
can
see
will
be
the
teacher
can
we
get
one
there
high
wages
for
stockmen
and
drovers
but
maybe
there
be
just
some
stranded
young
fool
glad
of
the
job
and
the
chance
of
makin
a
little
money
without
soiling
his
hands
you
could
pick
them
up
by
the
score
in
melbourne
but
here
he
shook
his
head
you
might
ask
a
few
questions
in
the
port
when
you
there
if
there
is
any
likely
young
man
she
said
aye
i
might
he
replied
there
was
an
amused
gleam
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
up
at
her
you
seem
to
have
thought
a
good
deal
on
this
matter
before
using
y
tongue
is
it
not
a
good
way
she
asked
the
smile
in
her
eyes
too
aye
he
admitted
grudgingly
a
very
good
way
and
you
do
not
mean
the
grass
to
grow
under
y
feet
mary
no
indeed
she
put
her
away
took
the
lighted
candle
from
the
table
and
went
to
her
room
the
loose
star
of
the
candle
flickered
a
moment
in
the
gloom
and
then
was
extinguished
but
donald
cameron
left
alone
before
the
fire
realised
that
the
subject
of
davey
schooling
had
been
disposed
of
chapter
viii
it
took
cameron
some
time
to
make
her
round
of
visits
but
she
was
very
pleased
with
the
result
of
them
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
she
drove
in
a
high
up
the
steep
hillside
on
the
top
of
which
a
shanty
had
been
built
only
a
few
months
before
it
was
a
stopping
place
for
stockmen
and
travellers
on
the
overland
track
the
only
one
between
the
scattered
settlements
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranges
and
the
wirree
river
from
the
head
of
the
ranges
it
looked
down
on
the
falling
slopes
of
lesser
hillsides
and
on
the
wide
sweep
of
the
inland
plains
it
was
not
more
than
five
or
six
miles
from
ayrmuir
but
she
had
made
it
the
last
place
to
visit
thinking
that
she
might
not
have
time
to
get
to
it
before
her
husband
was
due
to
return
from
the
clearwater
she
had
settled
in
her
own
mind
to
make
a
separate
journey
some
afternoon
if
she
could
not
include
it
in
this
one
but
her
plans
had
gone
well
and
briskly
all
the
women
she
had
seen
thought
the
school
a
good
idea
and
were
anxious
to
have
it
the
men
had
promised
to
help
in
the
building
and
to
pay
the
share
that
she
had
mentioned
as
likely
to
be
asked
of
them
for
the
schoolmaster
services
davey
had
enjoyed
the
first
part
of
the
excursion
as
much
as
she
had
he
had
romped
and
run
wild
with
boys
and
girls
on
the
homesteads
they
had
been
to
it
was
only
when
they
were
leaving
ross
that
morning
he
had
been
disturbed
after
his
mother
and
ross
had
kissed
cameron
had
shaken
hands
with
ted
and
mick
ross
and
kissed
little
jessie
and
he
had
shaken
hands
with
ross
and
grinned
at
the
boys
ross
exclaimed
why
davey
has
said
to
jess
she
had
lifted
the
child
up
to
his
face
jess
soft
skin
against
his
and
her
wet
baby
mouth
overwhelmed
him
with
confusion
he
brushed
his
coat
sleeve
across
his
cheek
oh
davey
his
mother
laughed
ross
laughed
too
and
ted
and
mick
giggled
hilariously
davey
had
climbed
into
the
cart
and
taken
his
seat
by
his
mother
angry
and
offended
he
had
no
idea
why
they
were
laughing
at
him
and
he
sat
stolid
and
sullen
brooding
over
it
all
the
morning
when
they
came
to
the
ramshackle
house
of
grey
palings
with
a
roof
of
corrugated
iron
on
the
top
of
the
hill
two
or
three
dogs
flew
out
barking
furiously
a
was
drawn
up
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
a
lean
stock
horse
hitched
to
a
post
stood
twitching
his
tail
to
keep
the
flies
away
half
a
dozen
scraggy
fowls
scratched
and
pecked
about
the
a
little
girl
with
dark
hair
ran
out
and
stood
staring
at
them
she
had
a
little
white
freckled
face
and
eyes
as
shy
and
bright
as
a
startled
wild
creature
cameron
got
down
from
the
cart
leaving
davey
in
it
holding
the
reins
she
said
to
the
child
i
want
to
see
mr
stevens
the
child
stared
at
her
then
a
man
came
to
the
dark
doorway
of
the
house
a
lean
lithe
man
with
bearded
chin
and
quick
restless
eyes
she
went
towards
him
and
explained
in
a
few
eager
words
why
she
had
come
will
you
come
in
and
take
a
seat
he
asked
his
voice
vibrating
strangely
she
went
into
the
house
its
very
shadow
exhaled
a
stale
smell
of
crude
spirits
and
tobacco
you
better
give
lass
a
drink
davey
she
called
i
be
back
presently
the
room
she
stepped
into
was
kept
with
an
attempt
at
orderliness
it
was
bare
and
cleanly
the
dull
afternoon
sunshine
garnished
its
bare
walls
the
rough
chairs
and
the
bunks
against
the
wall
the
man
had
followed
her
into
the
room
and
now
faced
her
there
was
a
suspension
of
the
breath
in
his
nostrils
as
this
quiet
woman
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
few
minutes
people
passed
and
repassed
the
room
feet
dragged
curious
glances
strayed
into
it
if
you
recognise
us
give
us
away
the
game
up
he
muttered
i
understand
cameron
said
steve
made
some
money
on
the
fields
he
said
he
bought
this
place
and
deirdre
and
i
came
with
him
to
see
him
settled
deirdre
the
child
you
saw
outside
belongs
to
me
it
about
her
i
came
cameron
explained
hurriedly
glad
to
leave
the
ground
of
troubled
memory
she
described
the
scheme
for
getting
a
school
in
the
district
building
a
room
somewhere
on
the
roadside
at
a
point
where
it
could
be
reached
by
children
of
the
scattered
clearings
who
to
be
the
teacher
he
asked
sitting
on
a
low
form
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
gazed
at
her
through
the
open
window
she
could
see
davey
sitting
up
very
stiff
and
straight
in
the
he
had
taken
his
red
history
book
from
his
pocket
and
was
pretending
to
read
the
child
whom
the
man
before
her
had
called
deirdre
was
standing
staring
at
him
a
smile
flitted
across
cameron
face
she
thought
that
davey
had
not
forgiven
her
sex
for
the
discomfiture
it
had
put
upon
him
that
morning
and
was
determined
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
little
girls
that
our
difficulty
the
teacher
she
said
the
only
persons
who
have
the
education
who
are
able
to
be
teachers
are
transports
convicts
he
interrupted
harshly
beg
your
pardon
his
voice
dropped
contritely
as
he
continued
you
were
saying
the
only
persons
in
the
colony
who
could
be
school
teachers
are
persons
of
evil
character
who
could
not
be
depended
on
not
to
corrupt
the
children
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
we
thought
if
we
could
get
a
young
man
with
the
education
who
seemed
reformed
we
would
give
him
a
chance
she
said
for
a
while
the
mothers
would
go
to
the
school
and
sit
there
during
some
of
the
to
see
that
the
children
did
not
learn
more
than
their
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
yes
she
smiled
do
you
think
you
would
be
willing
to
let
your
little
girl
come
to
the
school
if
we
can
get
a
teacher
he
flung
off
his
seat
and
strode
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
she
a
wild
cat
she
would
go
unless
he
threw
back
his
head
looking
at
her
a
blithe
defiance
creeping
into
his
eyes
and
voice
unless
you
made
me
the
teacher
he
said
what
would
you
say
if
i
applied
for
the
post
you
her
eyes
were
wide
with
amazement
oh
i
thought
so
he
laughed
but
your
reformed
young
man
would
have
something
of
a
past
too
you
know
and
it
might
not
be
as
clean
even
as
mine
it
a
pity
you
wo
consider
me
as
a
likely
person
i
got
what
you
call
the
have
you
she
asked
eagerly
the
grammar
geography
all
the
the
learning
that
is
to
a
liberal
education
all
that
and
letters
after
my
name
for
it
he
said
bitterly
but
i
an
irishman
i
called
myself
a
patriot
and
any
stick
is
good
enough
to
beat
a
dog
with
i
do
know
exactly
what
they
called
my
offence
to
revolt
or
seditious
language
perhaps
but
i
have
earned
my
sentence
since
i
got
here
it
was
that
i
was
doing
all
the
time
in
new
south
wales
and
the
island
to
revolt
and
seditious
language
but
the
fire
gone
out
of
me
now
i
want
a
quiet
life
in
his
eyes
she
read
a
passionate
impatience
and
weariness
if
you
were
willing
that
i
should
be
the
schoolmaster
the
other
people
would
be
likely
to
have
me
perhaps
he
continued
they
would
not
know
what
you
know
and
i
can
play
the
part
of
the
fool
who
has
lost
every
penny
he
had
on
the
fields
it
does
not
rest
with
me
naming
the
schoolmaster
of
course
she
said
a
little
troubled
but
if
the
others
are
willing
to
have
you
i
shall
be
glad
she
had
a
native
grace
that
took
for
granted
in
others
her
own
sincerity
and
purity
of
motive
i
am
grateful
cameron
he
said
she
smiled
to
think
that
he
knew
her
name
you
are
daniel
farrel
he
said
when
they
went
out
of
doors
lass
was
standing
deserted
with
her
nose
over
the
there
was
no
sight
or
sound
of
davey
or
deirdre
her
father
called
and
presently
she
came
racing
round
the
corner
of
the
house
hair
flying
and
eyes
bright
with
mischief
and
laughter
davey
followed
at
a
breakneck
pace
his
collar
was
twisted
and
a
jagged
tear
showed
in
his
grey
trousers
the
girl
flew
to
her
father
davey
came
to
a
standstill
sheepishly
a
few
yards
from
his
mother
what
have
you
been
doing
deirdre
farrel
asked
showing
him

back
of

she
said
eagerly
he
could
climb
because
his
trousers
were
too
tight
and
i
raced
him
up
the
hill
she
a
wild
thing

but

after

said
to
cameron
the

hand
her

dead
cameron
asked
gently
yes
he
said
davey
and
cameron
drove
away
davey
craned
his
neck
looking
back
along
the
road
several
times
and
the
last
time
he
looked
deirdre
was
standing
alone
an
elfish
figure
outlined
against
the
sunset

cried
his
eyes
alight

and

pelling
mother

hair

smiling
at
his
eagerness
and
belief
in
the
old
story

chapter
ix
it
was
not
long
before
a
building
of
slatted
shingles
appeared
in
a
clearing
off
the
road
two
or
three
miles
below
steve
it
stood
on
log
foundations
as
if
on
account
of
its
importance
and
had
a
door
at
one
end
of
its
wall
instead
of
in
the
middle
as
ordinary
houses
had
and
two
windows
with
small
square
panes
of
glass
stared
out
on
the
road
drovers
and
teamsters
on
the
roads
as
they
passed
to
listen
to
the
children
singing
and
went
on
their
way
with
oaths
of
admiration
throats
and
eyes
aching
sometimes
at
the
memories
and
vivid
pictures
the
sound
brought
them
behind
the
school
was
the
hut
which
had
been
run
up
for
the
schoolmaster
to
live
in
donald
cameron
had
given
the
plot
of
land
for
the
school
and
he
had
promised
to
sell
the
schoolmaster
a
few
acres
beside
it
if
he
wanted
to
make
use
of
his
spare
time
to
clear
the
land
put
in
a
crop
or
make
a
garden
mr
farrel
soon
intimated
that
he
did
and
came
to
terms
with
donald
cameron
at
first
no
more
than
a
dozen
children
went
to
school
some
walked
others
came
tumbling
into
the
clearing
two
or
three
of
a
stolid
old
horse
others
arrived
packed
together
in
a
at
the
back
of
the
clearing
was
a
fenced
paddock
into
which
the
horses
were
turned
during
school
hours
they
were
a
merry
company
of
young
warrigals
these
children
of
the
hills
when
they
poured
out
of
the
school
doorway
played
in
the
clearing
at
midday
munching
their
crusty
lunches
or
chased
in
the
horses
as
a
preliminary
to
scrambling
on
to
them
and
racing
each
other
down
the
bush
tracks
spreading
and
straggling
in
every
direction
to
their
homes
the
schoolmaster
governed
them
all
with
an
easy
familiarity
he
had
an
eager
boyish
way
of
talking
when
he
explained
a
peculiarity
of
spelling
or
grammar
or
a
story
from
history
a
light
reckless
humour
that
made
cameron
if
she
were
sitting
by
the
window
sewing
look
up
uneasily
her
serene
face
disturbed
her
eyes
mildly
reproving
but
the
children
laughed
and
loved
the
flippancies
they
scratched
and
scraped
the
better
for
being
on
good
terms
with
the
schoolmaster
although
cameron
was
afraid
that
they
had
not
a
proper
respect
for
him
and
that
he
was
not
dignified
enough
with
them
she
was
not
the
only
woman
who
sat
on
the
seat
by
the
window
sometimes
ross
or
morrison
took
a
turn
there
and
knitted
or
stitched
as
they
watched
to
see
that
the
schoolmaster
behaviour
was
all
that
might
be
expected
they
knew
nothing
of
farrel
history
or
antecedents
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
he
was
a
irishman
who
had
come
to
make
his
fortune
on
the
goldfields
and
lost
any
money
he
had
that
was
his
story
and
that
he
wanted
to
live
a
quiet
life
for
awhile
away
from
the
temptations
and
risks
of
the
scramble
for
gold
his
manner
and
air
were
decorous
enough
to
make
them
believe
it
and
after
the
first
few
visits
of
inspection
they
were
satisfied
not
to
make
any
more
only
mary
cameron
was
concerned
as
to
the
nature
of
some
of
the
seeds
he
was
sowing
in
the
minds
of
the
young
generation
she
had
heard
him
describing
the
state
of
ireland
under
his
most
gracious
majesty
george
iii
to
the
older
boys
and
girls
and
on
another
occasion
had
heard
him
telling
them
that
the
exports
of
great
britain
were
cotton
and
woollen
goods
coal
and
iron
and
convicts
to
new
south
wales
and
van
land
did
you
have
good
lessons
davey
she
asked
one
evening
when
her
son
was
poring
over
his
books
not
half
as
good
as
yesterday
when
you
were
there
mother
he
said
why
how
was
that
she
asked
oh
farrel
says
more
things
to
make
us
laugh
when
you
there
he
said
going
on
with
his
writing
painstakingly
he
made
me
do
sums
all
this
morning
and
i
never
have
got
them
right
if
deirdre
had
helped
me
he
lets
her
sit
next
me
now
when
school
was
out
a
day
or
two
later
cameron
rose
from
her
seat
by
the
window
she
tied
her
bonnet
strings
the
schoolmaster
hummed
the
tune
the
children
had
been
singing
before
they
clattered
out
for
the
day
it
was
an
old
english
folk
song
that
he
had
taught
them
as
he
put
away
his
books
and
pencils
his
eyes
wandered
towards
cameron
once
or
twice
her
back
was
to
him
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
he
strode
over
to
her
he
knew
she
was
displeased
his
eyes
had
the
guilty
look
of
awaiting
reproof
the
glad
light
of
the
miscreant
who
knows
that
he
has
done
wrong
but
has
enjoyed
doing
it
he
had
not
admitted
to
himself
even
that
his
reason
for
talking
to
make
the
children
laugh
and
pointing
a
story
from
history
with
a
radical
or
cynical
moral
was
that
her
anxiety
about
the
instruction
they
were
getting
might
not
be
quite
lulled
he
did
not
want
her
to
give
up
coming
to
the
school
and
cease
to
occupy
the
seat
by
the
window
occasionally
but
there
was
something
in
her
face
this
afternoon
that
he
had
not
seen
there
before
it
was
a
pity
to
talk
to
the
children
the
way
you
did
she
said
simply
facts
mrs
cameron
he
cried
gaily
the
facts
of
life
presented
in
an
interesting
form
are
far
more
important
to
boys
and
girls
than
a
knowledge
of
let
us
say
geography
it
was
geography
among
other
things
we
asked
you
to
teach
them
she
replied
i
beg
your
pardon
his
pride
was
cut
to
the
quick
he
bowed
awkwardly
i
sha
be
coming
to
the
school
any
more
farrel
she
said
after
a
few
moments
there
was
an
odd
mixture
of
dignity
and
humility
in
her
bearing
we
all
grateful
to
you
for
what
you
have
done
in
teaching
the
children
i
knew
from
the
first
that
you
were
to
be
trusted
that
no
harm
would
come
of
your
schooling
and
davey
has
told
me
that
it
is
only
when
i
am
here
that
you
talk
as
you
have
done
you
know
i
been
coming
for
my
own
learning
and
not
to
see
that
you
taught
properly
i
came
often
because
i
wanted
to
learn
and
keep
up
with
davey
so
that
i
could
help
him
perhaps
there
was
an
unmistakable
break
in
her
voice
it
was
not
very
kind
to
laugh
at
me
she
took
the
wild
flowers
from
the
jar
of
water
on
her
table
by
the
window
as
she
always
did
and
went
to
the
door
it
had
been
very
pleasant
for
her
to
sit
on
the
bench
under
the
window
hearing
the
children
sing
old
country
songs
and
listening
to
the
schoolmaster
telling
them
of
other
parts
of
the
world
of
rules
of
speech
and
calculation
of
the
nature
of
the
earth
the
heavens
the
stars
and
the
sea
of
kingdoms
strange
peoples
and
their
histories
and
occupations
the
sunlight
had
come
through
the
open
window
and
a
breeze
bearing
the
honey
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
fleecing
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
had
fanned
her
face
she
was
so
sorry
to
be
giving
up
those
days
in
the
that
a
mist
of
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
glanced
about
it
she
had
felt
an
innocent
almost
childish
pleasure
in
them
and
in
learning
with
the
children
cameron
the
schoolmaster
sprang
after
her
the
trouble
in
his
face
surprised
her
do
say
that
i
that
i
that
you
think
i
could
he
was
not
able
to
say
laugh
at
you
but
she
had
gone
he
dropped
into
her
chair
by
the
window
and
threw
his
arms
across
the
table
chapter
x
the
school
had
been
working
for
over
three
years
when
cameron
and
the
schoolmaster
came
to
an
agreement
by
which
davey
was
to
have
extra
lessons
after
school
hours
to
learn
something
of
foreign
languages
and
of
the
higher
mathematics
not
to
speak
of
other
odds
and
ends
of
knowledge
that
farrel
might
consider
part
of
that
liberal
education
she
was
so
anxious
he
should
acquire
and
deirdre
was
to
stay
with
cameron
for
a
while
and
learn
to
cook
and
sew
and
generally
to
practise
woman
ways
about
a
house
it
was
bareback
on
lass
that
davey
and
deirdre
came
jogging
along
the
road
from
school
for
the
first
time
cameron
heard
their
shrill
joyous
voices
long
before
they
emerged
from
the
cover
of
the
trees
then
she
watched
them
climbing
the
track
across
the
rise
straddling
the
old
horse
fat
sides
deirdre
with
her
arms
round
davey
waist
the
red
handkerchief
containing
her
wardrobe
in
his
left
hand
fast
in
lass
matted
mane
he
gave
the
old
mare
a
flick
now
and
again
with
a
stripped
branch
he
had
in
his
right
hand
though
it
made
no
more
impression
than
a
fly
alighting
on
her
thick
hair
she
kept
on
at
her
steady
jogging
pace
until
they
were
against
the
yard
gate
cameron
laughed
when
she
saw
them
she
kissed
deirdre
and
took
the
red
bundle
from
davey
hand
father
says
deirdre
said
a
quaint
air
of
sedateness
settling
down
on
her
that
he
to
send
me
without
stockings
or
a
wedding
garment
cameron
but
if
you
will
get
what
is
necessary
for
me
next
time
you
go
to
the
port
he
will
be
what
was
it
davey
extremely
obliged
davey
replied
carefully
farrel
says
that
bought
her
shoes
and
stockings
over
and
over
again
mother
but
she
wo
wear
them
there
two
shoes
in
the
nest
by
our
house
and
a
pair
of
boots
in
the
creek
deirdre
admitted
with
a
sidelong
look
at
him
while
davey
took
lass
to
the
paddock
on
the
top
of
the
hill
deirdre
went
indoors
with
cameron
she
had
never
been
away
from
her
father
before
at
first
she
had
been
surprised
at
the
suggestion
of
going
anywhere
without
him
but
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
going
to
learn
to
be
like
cameron
a
good
housewife
so
that
she
could
look
after
him
and
their
home
as
well
as
a
grown
woman
and
she
was
delighted
at
the
idea
jogging
up
the
hills
behind
davey
she
had
not
realised
that
she
was
to
spend
the
night
away
from
dan
as
he
was
to
her
in
all
her
tense
moments
it
was
only
when
she
went
into
the
tiny
room
with
two
little
white
beds
in
it
that
she
began
to
understand
this
she
gazed
at
the
room
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
with
its
white
covers
little
cupboard
with
a
mirror
on
it
and
papered
walls
spread
with
red
and
brown
flowers
you
must
wash
your
face
and
hands
and
feet
deirdre
cameron
said
and
then
i
bring
you
a
pair
of
davey
shoes
and
stockings
to
wear
until
i
can
get
others
for
you
she
unknotted
the
red
handkerchief
the
two
or
three
little
garments
of
coarse
calico
it
contained
had
been
washed
and
mary
turned
them
over
critically
dan
washed
them
himself
deirdre
said
sullenly
sensing
the
criticism
he
put
them
under
his
bed
and
slept
on
them
so
that
they
would
look
nice
this
morning
he
sewed
up
the
holes
too
and
he
said
god
when
he
folded
them
up
and
put
them
in
the
handkerchief
cameron
stared
at
the
clothes
her
heart
sore
for
the
schoolmaster
and
his
attempt
to
send
the
child
to
her
with
all
her
little
belongings
neatly
mended
and
in
order
there
was
silence
a
moment
then
deirdre
started
away
from
her
i
do
want
to
stay
here
she
cried
deirdre
cameron
was
amazed
at
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
sunny
little
face
i
want
dan
i
want
to
go
home
deirdre
cried
passionately
i
want
to
stay
here
i
do
want
to
be
like
you
i
want
want
dan
she
brushed
past
cameron
and
ran
out
of
the
house
cameron
went
after
her
calling
her
but
deirdre
a
light
flying
figure
ran
on
sobbing
the
trees
swallowed
her
where
the
child
davey
asked
with
the
easy
superiority
of
his
extra
years
when
he
came
down
from
the
stables
and
found
his
mother
standing
at
the
gate
looking
down
the
track
deirdre
and
he
had
just
come
by
she
gone
davey
cameron
cried
distressfully
gone
where
home
she
went
down
the
track
he
asked
cameron
nodded
tears
of
disappointment
in
her
eyes
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
having
a
little
girl
to
teach
and
look
after
as
though
she
were
her
own
davey
set
off
at
a
run
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
that
he
returned
a
kicking
struggling
scratching
little
creature
in
his
arms
he
released
his
hold
of
her
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
threw
her
from
him
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
there
scratch
cat
he
cried
fiercely
next
time
you
try
to
run
away
remember
what
the
schoolmaster
said
you
love
me
deirdre
you
be
good
to
cameron
and
do
what
she
wants
you
to
deirdre
had
dropped
to
the
floor
and
was
crying
wildly
furiously
davey
stared
at
her
if
you
do
stop
that
howling
and
yelling
at
once
i
ride
over
and
tell
him
how
you
behaving
he
said
and
then
what
he
say
deirdre
sobbing
subsided
there
was
a
heavy
step
outside
donald
cameron
opened
the
kitchen
door
what
this
he
asked
looking
down
on
the
huddled
heap
on
the
floor
that
was
deirdre
he
glanced
questioningly
from
his
wife
to
davey
it
the
schoolmaster
little
girl
cameron
explained
never
been
away
from
him
before
and
well
we
ca
have
this
noise
in
the
place
he
said
irritably
deirdre
had
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
that
harsh
voice
the
sight
of
davey
father
quelled
her
take
her
away
and
see
that
she
gets
ready
for
tea
davey
cameron
said
anxiously
although
deirdre
made
no
more
noise
she
sat
shivering
and
quivering
all
the
evening
her
eyes
vacant
of
all
but
an
inexpressible
misery
her
thin
little
body
shaken
by
long
gasping
breaths
cameron
tried
to
comfort
and
console
her
talking
to
her
gently
and
lovingly
as
she
put
her
to
bed
but
the
child
mind
was
adamant
i
want
dan
i
want
dan
she
sobbed
and
in
the
morning
when
cameron
went
into
her
room
the
window
was
open
and
the
little
white
bed
empty

davey

with

his
look
of
reproach
went
into
deirdre
heart
with
a
wailing
cry
she
burst
into
tears
again
davey
after
his
first
glance
at
her
kept
his
eyes
on
his
book
he
tried
not
to
see
her
or
hear
her
sobbing
beside
him
his
heart
was
hot
against
farrel
for
after
all
it
was
because
she
loved
the
schoolmaster
so
much
and
could
not
bear
to
be
separated
from
him
that
deirdre
was
crying
like
this
he
told
himself
it
was
hard
that
farrel
should
be
angry
with
her
as
well
as
everybody
else
when
she
had
made
everybody
angry
with
her
on
his
account
but
the
sight
of
deirdre
grief
was
more
than
the
schoolmaster
could
bear
either
he
lifted
her
out
of
her
seat
and
carried
her
off
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
sat
there
with
her
on
his
knee
talking
to
her
for
awhile
once
davey
glanced
in
their
direction
but
he
looked
away
quickly
he
had
seen
tears
on
the
schoolmaster
lean
swarthy
cheeks
and
deirdre
face
lifted
to
his
with
a
penitent
radiance
and
eyes
shining
the
joy
of
being
folded
into
his
love
again
had
banished
the
desolation
and
bleak
misery
from
her
face
when
school
was
out
jess
clambered
into
the
davey
had
come
to
school
in
that
day
and
perched
herself
on
the
high
seat
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
followed
them
along
the
road
a
little
later
lass
went
without
any
flicking
with
a
switch
or
mirthful
goading
of
hard
young
heels
that
afternoon
davey
brooded
over
the
tragedy
of
deirdre
having
to
become
domesticated
and
of
her
love
for
her
father
that
made
it
unendurable
for
her
to
be
away
from
him
even
for
a
night
since
he
had
forgiven
her
and
they
had
come
to
an
understanding
she
had
eyes
for
nobody
else
her
eyes
had
followed
him
all
the
afternoon
still
swimming
with
tears
an
adoring
light
in
them
davey
young
male
instinct
was
piqued
he
had
had
no
existence
for
her
yet
he
had
always
been
her
and
felt
for
her
more
than
anybody
else
even
the
schoolmaster
he
was
sure
jess
jolted
up
and
down
contentedly
on
the
seat
beside
him
the
ends
of
her
little
fair
flipped
his
arm
she
chatted
gaily
i
like
you
better
than
any
of
the
other
boys
at
school
davey
she
said
with
innocent
candour
i
think
you
the
nicest
boy
and
marry
you
when
i
grow
up
mother
says
you
kissed
me
once
when
i
was
quite
a
little
girl
and
boys
only
kiss
girls
who
are
their
sweethearts
do
they
davey
no
i
do
know
davey
muttered
jessie
ross
was
a
fair
little
girl
with
stockings
and
black
boots
on
her
dangling
feet
her
round
little
face
never
freckled
nor
got
sunburnt
though
she
only
wore
a
hat
or
bonnet
in
the
summer
time
her
skin
was
prettily
coloured
and
her
eyes
smiled
up
at
him
easily
it
pleased
davey
to
think
that
she
thought
he
was
the
nicest
boy
he
smiled
sheepishly
it
was
good
to
think
that
somebody
liked
him
he
looked
round
to
see
how
far
behind
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
were
they
were
not
very
far
he
saw
deirdre
leaning
happily
against
her
father
although
in
her
hand
davey
eyes
lighted
was
the
red
bundle
he
clucked
and
whistled
to
lass
old
lazybones
he
called
cheerily
jess
chirruped
after
him
old
lazybones
you
do
like
deirdre
better
than
me
do
you
davey
she
asked
no
said
davey
in
his
good
humour
and
sore
at
indifference
to
his
attempts
to
attract
her
attention
all
day
the
schoolmaster
means
she
to
stay
with
us
anyway
he
thought
jess
sighed
then
if
you
like
me
you
can
kiss
me
again
davey
she
said
eh
davey
looked
scared
well
then
i
kiss
you
jess
said
gaily
and
forth
with
did
davey
felt
himself
grow
hot
and
red
jess
laughed
delightedly
oh
you
look
so
funny
davey
she
cried
mick
does
look
like
that
when
i
kiss
him
jess
was
only
a
kid
davey
told
himself
and
because
she
had
brothers
and
kissed
them
thought
she
could
kiss
other
boys
yet
her
gay
little
peck
at
his
cheek
had
not
displeased
him
he
wondered
whether
deirdre
and
the
schoolmaster
had
seen
it
davey
got
out
of
the
cart
to
swing
open
the
long
gate
he
left
it
open
for
the
schoolmaster
cameron
came
into
the
yard
jess
jumped
out
of
the
cart
and
ran
to
her
mother
says
cameron
dear
she
cried
would
you
please
give
her
the
recipe
for
making
with
gum
leaves
and
she
sends
her
love
and
hopes
you
are
well
as
she
is
and
our
black
cow
has
a
calf
and
i
found
thirteen
eggs
in
a
nest
in
the
creek
paddock
and
mick
killed
a
snake
long
under
the
verandah
on
sunday
cameron
smiled
and
kissed
her
jess
snuggled
affectionately
against
her
the
schoolmaster
bringing
deirdre
davey
said
cameron
eyes
flew
along
the
track
to
the
other
cart
that
was
coming
slowly
up
the
hillside
davey
took
charge
of
the
schoolmaster
horse
cameron
and
he
and
the
children
went
indoors
i
come
to
apologise
cameron
for
deirdre
rudeness
last
night
the
schoolmaster
said
gravely
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
say
that
you
would
teach
her
what
i
so
much
want
her
to
know
i
hope
that
you
will
forgive
her
and
his
voice
trembled
deirdre
you
got
something
to
say
to
cameron
yourself
you
i
sorry
deirdre
cried
with
a
dry
breathless
gasp
her
face
had
whitened
the
misery
had
come
into
her
eyes
again
they
went
appealingly
to
the
schoolmaster
and
back
to
cameron
face
will
you
forgive
me
and
teach
me
to
cook
and
sew
and
be
a
good
housewife
she
sobbed
as
if
she
were
repeating
a
lesson
poor
child
cameron
compassionate
gaze
turned
from
deirdre
to
the
schoolmaster
do
you
really
think
you
ought
to
she
asked
so
help
me
god
he
said
struggling
with
his
emotion
this
is
the
only
chance
i
got
of
making
a
decent
woman
of
her
your
influence
if
you
will
use
it
i
do
want
her
to
be
a
hoyden
always
she
must
be
gentled
and
tamed
and
if
you
will
be
as
good
as
to
help
me
he
stopped
abruptly
you
will
forgive
me
he
said
and
went
out
of
the
room
deirdre
made
a
quick
passionate
gesture
after
him
she
did
not
call
him
but
a
sob
broke
as
she
stood
staring
after
him
she
ran
into
the
garden
to
watch
the
cart
with
him
in
it
go
down
the
hillside
and
slip
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
grass
and
sobbed
davey
moved
to
go
out
to
her
leave
her
alone
his
mother
said
gently
it
best
to
let
her
get
over
it
by
herself
davey
jess
flew
backwards
and
forwards
helping
to
set
the
table
she
delighted
in
making
herself
useful
oh
cameron
what
a
funny
she
cried
we
got
two
blue
ones
and
a
big
new
lamp
mother
got
at
the
port
cameron
looked
from
the
face
of
the
schoolmaster
little
daughter
to
the
plump
child
of
her
nearest
and
most
prosperous
neighbour
and
sighed
when
the
tea
was
made
she
and
the
children
sat
round
the
table
for
their
meal
donald
cameron
was
away
and
not
expected
home
for
a
day
or
two
deirdre
tried
to
eat
when
she
was
told
to
but
her
lips
quivered
she
choked
over
the
mouthfuls
of
food
she
swallowed
cameron
put
her
arms
round
her
but
deirdre
stiffened
against
their
gentle
pressure
she
would
not
be
comforted
davey
stared
at
her
miserably
only
jess
chattered
on
artlessly
taking
no
notice
of
her
eating
all
her
bread
and
butter
and
drinking
her
milk
and
water
saying
her
grace
and
asking
to
be
excused
from
the
table
when
she
had
finished
her
meal
as
though
she
were
demonstrating
generally
how
a
nice
child
ought
to
behave
she
had
the
other
bed
in
the
room
in
which
deirdre
had
been
put
to
sleep
the
night
before
cameron
kissed
them
both
jess
responded
eagerly
to
her
caress
she
threw
her
arms
round
cameron
neck
and
rubbed
her
soft
little
face
against
hers
purring
affectionately
i
do
love
you
cameron
dear
she
whispered
deirdre
submitted
to
the
kiss
she
did
not
respond
to
it
of
davey
she
took
no
notice
when
she
went
to
the
little
room
she
and
jess
were
to
sleep
in
jess
held
up
her
face
for
him
to
kiss
as
cameron
had
done
but
he
turned
away
brusquely
as
if
he
did
not
see
it
and
she
ran
off
crying
gaily
davey
jones
and
sweet
sleep
rest
your
bones
jess
undressed
methodically
as
she
took
off
each
garment
she
folded
it
and
laid
it
neatly
on
the
chair
beside
her
bed
when
she
had
on
her
little
of
unbleached
calico
she
brushed
her
hair
and
plaited
it
again
so
that
it
hung
in
two
braids
on
either
side
of
her
face
then
she
knelt
down
by
her
bedside
folded
her
hands
together
and
prayed
aloud
she
got
into
bed
and
looked
at
deirdre
across
the
patchwork
quilt
conscious
of
having
performed
her
whole
duty
for
the
day
are
you
sorry
you
such
a
bad
naughty
wicked
little
girl
she
asked
deirdre
sobs
were
her
only
answer
god
does
love
you
and
i
do
and
cameron
and
davey
love
you
either
nobody
loves
bad
wicked
naughty
little
girls
jess
said
solemnly
she
put
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
was
sleeping
sweetly
peacefully
in
a
few
minutes
deirdre
crept
to
the
open
window
she
gazed
out
of
it
at
the
dark
heave
of
the
forest
that
cut
her
off
from
the
being
she
loved
and
the
hut
in
the
clearing
behind
the
school
the
blue
night
sky
that
spread
over
her
was
spread
over
the
hut
in
the
clearing
and
the
school
too
she
knew
they
were
not
many
miles
away
the
hut
the
clearing
and
the
school
from
gazing
steadily
before
her
and
realising
that
fact
she
glanced
from
the
window
to
the
ground
it
was
such
a
little
distance
davey
going
to
bed
in
a
loft
in
the
barn
saw
her
standing
at
the
window
and
watched
her
a
troubled
pain
at
her
suffering
gripping
his
heart
when
she
dropped
from
the
window
into
the
garden
he
was
beside
her
in
an
instant
he
caught
her
sobbing
breath
as
he
touched
her
you
not
going
home
deirdre
he
asked
yes
she
panted
her
eyes
wide
and
dark
with
anguish
i
ca
bear
it
davey
i
ca
breathe
he
be
angry
davey
said
yes
she
cried
and
sobbed
quietly
for
a
moment
but
i
rather
be
angry
than
send
me
away
from
him
it
be
morning
soon
if
you
walked
you
would
be
home
any
earlier
than
if
you
waited
for
us
to
go
to
school
davey
said
with
rare
subtlety
the
schoolmaster
wo
be
angry
if
you
wait
till
then
deirdre
and
a
brilliant
inspiration
came
to
him
i
bring
lass
in
an
hour
earlier
and
we
can
start
then
true
davey
her
eyes
questioned
him
tragically
true
as
death
he
said
and
struck
his
breast
three
times
she
turned
to
go
back
to
the
bedroom
i
sorry
that
sorry
deirdre
he
cried
fumbling
for
words
and
unable
to
express
his
sympathy
she
did
not
turn
or
look
back
at
him
as
she
clambered
in
the
window
but
her
face
in
the
morning
showed
that
she
understood
his
championship
she
turned
to
him
eagerly
when
she
saw
him
at
breakfast
a
subdued
gratitude
in
her
eyes
davey
thought
that
she
had
at
last
recognised
in
him
a
friend
to
whom
she
could
turn
when
everybody
hand
was
against
her
chapter
xii
for
months
davey
and
deirdre
went
together
along
the
winding
tracks
from
the
school
to
cameron
and
from
cameron
to
school
sometimes
in
the
but
more
often
on
lass
broad
back
deirdre
had
to
hang
on
to
davey
when
the
old
horse
took
it
into
her
head
to
step
out
jauntily
but
for
the
most
part
they
rode
her
lightly
enough
davey
with
one
hand
on
her
mane
and
deirdre
swinging
behind
him
sometimes
davey
dug
his
heels
into
her
fat
sides
and
put
her
at
a
trot
that
set
them
bumping
up
and
down
like
peas
in
a
box
and
laughing
till
the
hills
echoed
and
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
fun
they
found
themselves
shot
on
the
roadside
as
lass
shied
and
propped
pretending
to
be
startled
by
a
wallaby
or
a
dead
tree
these
comfortable
shies
and
proppings
were
regarded
as
her
little
joke
her
way
of
indicating
that
she
did
not
like
being
dug
in
the
sides
they
shrieked
with
laughter
as
she
stood
blinking
at
them
her
eyes
on
which
a
chalky
whiteness
was
growing
bland
and
innocent
as
if
she
were
so
surprised
and
had
done
it
all
of
a
purpose
they
explained
to
each
other
deirdre
quickly
outgrew
the
dresses
that
cameron
had
first
made
for
her
the
schoolmaster
thought
that
davey
was
growing
too
although
lass
was
up
to
the
weight
of
the
two
and
they
ran
beside
her
up
the
hillsides
as
often
as
not
and
rode
her
only
one
at
a
time
as
they
grew
older
with
keen
eyes
for
a
fair
thing
where
a
horse
was
concerned
the
schoolmaster
bought
a
little
wilding
of
a
chestnut
for
deirdre
to
ride
a
stockman
had
traded
the
colt
for
a
bottle
of
rum
when
his
mare
foaled
at
steve
she
was
a
fine
animal
with
a
strain
of
arab
in
her
and
when
the
schoolmaster
had
mouthed
and
gentled
white
socks
as
deirdre
christened
the
colt
she
straddled
him
bareback
and
davey
had
his
old
lass
to
himself
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
watch
deirdre
as
she
went
off
down
the
track
clinging
lightly
to
the
little
horse
whose
legs
spread
out
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
davey
heart
sickened
with
envy
every
time
deirdre
dashed
past
him
he
urged
lass
to
the
limit
of
her
heavy
clompering
gait
but
even
then
she
did
not
keep
the
chestnut
in
sight
and
all
but
broke
a
blood
vessel
in
the
attempt
when
davey
came
up
to
her
deirdre
was
invariably
twisted
round
waiting
for
him
a
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
her
hair
flying
about
her
you
break
your
neck
some
day
riding
like
that
he
told
her
sombrely
but
he
was
eating
his
heart
out
at
not
having
a
horse
to
put
against
hers
at
not
being
able
to
send
flying
the
pebbles
on
the
hill
tracks
as
she
did
he
had
asked
his
father
over
and
over
again
for
a
horse
of
his
own
but
donald
cameron
would
not
give
him
one
no
my
lad
he
said
shrewdly
i
not
going
to
have
you
racing
horses
of
mine
on
these
roads
with
the
schoolmaster
girl
breaking
their
knees
and
windin
them
i
have
money
to
throw
away
if
the
schoolmaster
has
by
and
by
when
you
working
with
me
you
have
a
good
stock
horse
of
y
own
maybe
davey
school
days
were
numbered
cameron
knew
he
was
shooting
up
into
a
long
straggling
youth
his
father
was
talking
of
breaking
him
into
the
work
of
the
place
and
davey
was
beginning
to
be
restive
at
school
wanting
to
do
man
work
and
get
a
horse
of
his
own
deirdre
learnt
womanly
ways
about
a
house
quickly
enough
when
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
although
since
the
new
order
of
things
at
ayrmuir
cameron
had
jenny
a
big
girl
from
the
wirree
to
help
her
and
the
family
had
meals
in
the
parlour
and
sat
on
the
best
shiny
black
furniture
every
day
deirdre
made
beds
dusted
and
swept
with
cameron
she
fed
the
fowls
and
learnt
to
cook
and
sew
davey
had
seen
her
churning
sleeves
rolled
up
from
her
long
thin
arms
he
had
watched
her
and
his
mother
shapeless
masses
of
butter
in
the
cool
dark
of
the
dairy
when
they
washed
clothes
in
tubs
on
the
hillside
he
carried
buckets
of
water
for
them
and
had
helped
to
hang
the
clean
heavy
wet
things
on
lines
between
the
trees
or
to
spread
them
on
the
grass
to
cameron
had
taught
deirdre
to
knit
and
when
her
husband
was
not
at
home
had
even
taken
her
spinning
wheel
from
under
its
covers
set
it
up
in
the
garden
and
showed
her
how
to
use
it
she
had
sat
quite
a
long
time
at
it
spinning
and
delighting
in
its
old
friendly
purr
and
clatter
at
such
times
she
would
sing
softly
to
herself
davey
and
deirdre
crouched
on
the
grass
beside
her
and
when
they
begged
for
them
she
would
tell
some
of
the
fairy
tales
they
loved
to
hear
cameron
scarcely
ever
saw
the
schoolmaster
and
it
was
rarely
then
that
she
spoke
to
him
sometimes
she
discovered
him
in
the
background
of
a
gathering
of
hill
folk
who
met
in
the
on
sundays
for
hymns
prayers
and
a
reading
of
the
scriptures
and
sometimes
she
heard
him
singing
in
the
distance
as
he
rode
along
the
hill
roads
deirdre
had
sensed
a
reserve
in
cameron
manner
and
attitude
towards
her
father
and
could
not
forgive
her
for
it
though
she
had
a
shy
affection
for
her
davey
was
not
sure
that
he
liked
the
deirdre
who
had
learnt
to
brush
her
hair
and
wear
woman
clothes
as
well
as
the
old
deirdre
there
was
something
more
subdued
about
her
her
laughter
was
rarer
though
it
had
still
the
catch
and
ripple
of
a
wild
bird
song
she
was
not
quite
tamed
however
for
all
that
she
did
deftly
and
quickly
though
it
was
done
had
a
certain
wild
grace
it
was
one
evening
when
she
was
knitting
making
a
pair
of
socks
for
the
schoolmaster
and
muttering
to
herself
knit
one
slip
one
knit
one
two
together
slip
one
that
he
realised
deirdre
was
going
a
way
and
that
he
had
to
go
a
man
it
be
moonlight
early
and
there
be
dozens
of
in
the
white
gums
near
the
creek
deirdre
he
said
coming
to
her
eagerly
the
proposition
of
a
hunt
had
always
been
irresistible
deirdre
had
loved
to
crouch
in
the
bushes
with
him
on
moonlight
nights
and
watch
the
little
creatures
at
play
on
the
high
branches
of
trees
near
the
edge
of
the
clearing
they
had
flung
knobby
pieces
of
wood
at
them
or
catapulted
them
and
were
rejoiced
beyond
measure
when
a
shot
told
there
was
a
startled
scream
among
the
and
a
little
grey
body
tumbled
from
a
bough
in
the
moonlight
to
the
dark
earth
but
this
night
deirdre
shook
her
head
and
went
on
with
her
murmuring
of
knit
one
slip
one
knit
one
two
together
slip
one
no
i
ca
go
davey
she
said
i
want
to
finish
turning
this
heel
chapter
xiii
the
summer
of
davey
first
year
work
with
his
father
was
the
driest
the
early
settlers
had
known
in
the
south
a
breathless
insistent
heat
brooded
over
the
hills
their
narrow
valleys
and
the
long
bare
wirree
plains
the
grass
stood
stiff
and
by
the
roads
and
in
the
cleared
paddocks
rustling
when
anything
moved
in
it
hordes
of
grasshoppers
lay
in
it
whistling
and
whispering
huskily
or
rose
with
whirring
wings
when
anything
disturbed
them
the
skies
faded
to
grey
gave
no
promise
of
rain
and
when
the
sun
set
it
left
a
dull
angry
flush
the
colour
of
a
black
snake
belly
behind
the
hills
the
lesser
mountain
streams
dried
up
the
creek
that
ran
through
cameron
paddocks
became
a
mere
trickle
there
was
only
one
deep
pool
left
of
it
in
that
only
enough
water
remained
to
keep
the
household
going
for
a
month
when
donald
cameron
mustered
and
he
davey
and
the
stockmen
drove
the
cattle
to
the
clearwater
river
ten
miles
away
to
the
it
was
still
in
good
condition
and
cameron
held
three
hundred
acres
of
the
river
frontage
there
he
was
better
off
than
most
of
the
hill
folk
who
after
driving
their
cattle
a
dozen
miles
or
so
for
water
had
to
pay
high
prices
for
paddocks
to
run
them
in
every
man
of
cameron
was
away
at
the
clearwater
and
cameron
and
jenny
alone
at
the
homestead
the
afternoon
that
deirdre
came
riding
up
out
of
the
misty
depths
of
the
trees
for
days
a
heavy
haze
had
covered
the
hills
cameron
could
not
from
her
doorway
see
the
slopes
of
the
ranges
behind
the
house
the
mist
hung
like
a
pall
over
the
trees
seeming
to
stifle
the
wild
life
of
them
not
a
twitter
of
birds
was
heard
parroquets
breaking
the
mist
with
the
scarlet
and
blue
and
green
of
their
wings
and
breasts
dashed
over
the
clearing
chattering
hoarsely
now
and
then
they
rose
from
the
orchard
with
shrill
screams
as
jenny
drove
them
away
from
the
few
shrivelled
plums
left
on
the
trees
by
flapping
a
at
them
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
burning
the
fires
have
been
bad
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranges
deirdre
told
cameron
as
she
came
into
the
yard
and
slipped
her
bridle
from
socks
neck
father
is
taking
our
poddies
and
cows
and
steve
to
the
clearwater
yes
cameron
said
some
men
on
the
roads
told
us
a
few
days
ago
that
we
better
get
our
beasts
out
of
the
back
paddocks
in
case
the
fires
come
this
way
deirdre
caught
socks
by
his
forelock
but
instead
of
turning
him
into
the
paddock
behind
the
stables
as
she
ordinarily
did
she
led
him
into
one
of
the
stalls
and
slammed
the
door
on
him
a
man
at
steve
this
morning
said
some
of
the
people
on
the
other
side
been
burnt
out
she
said
the
fires
swept
over
the
bush
as
if
it
were
a
grass
paddock
martin
at
dale
is
burnt
down
and
he
said
that
some
of
the
children
going
home
from
the
dale
school
were
burnt
to
death
cameron
exclaimed
distressfully
the
fires
came
up
so
quickly
they
could
get
home
before
them
deirdre
continued
and
when
they
turned
to
go
back
the
flames
were
all
round
father
sent
me
up
davey
and
cameron
being
away
he
thought
you
might
know
if
the
fires
are
at
dale
there
was
a
flicker
of
anxiety
in
cameron
eyes
they
travelled
over
forty
miles
already
deirdre
said
and
father
says
if
the
wind
changes
we
get
them
up
here
for
sure
they
may
sweep
right
on
as
it
is
and
miss
us
but
he
said
it
would
be
madness
to
try
to
fight
them
with
only
the
three
of
us
and
if
they
do
come
this
way
to
get
down
to
the
pool
at
once
he
said
he
try
to
get
here
if
the
wind
changes
once
or
twice
there
had
been
scrub
fires
in
the
summer
and
cameron
with
everybody
else
on
the
place
had
helped
to
beat
out
the
forked
flames
which
tried
to
make
their
way
across
the
paddocks
of
the
clearing
to
the
house
and
sheds
she
had
carried
water
for
the
men
beating
when
there
was
water
to
spare
and
they
had
dipped
their
bags
and
branches
of
green
gum
leaves
into
the
water
and
slashed
at
the
flames
in
the
grass
there
are
beaters
and
bags
by
the
barn
she
said
i
cut
the
beaters
after
davey
and
his
father
had
gone
thinking
we
might
want
them
she
meant
to
make
a
fight
for
her
home
if
the
fires
came
that
way
deirdre
realised
the
afternoon
wore
away
slowly
cameron
had
few
treasures
but
she
made
a
bundle
of
them
a
bible
some
of
davey
baby
clothes
an
brooch
with
a
mosaic
on
black
stone
that
donald
cameron
had
given
her
and
desired
her
to
wear
with
the
black
silk
dress
he
had
insisted
on
her
having
and
appearing
in
occasionally
when
people
began
to
call
him
the
laird
of
ayrmuir
the
dress
was
more
an
object
of
veneration
than
anything
else
but
she
wrapped
it
and
the
ribband
and
the
piece
of
lace
that
she
wore
with
it
into
the
bundle
and
put
them
with
her
spinning
wheel
and
a
pair
of
blue
vases
that
had
been
her
first
parlour
ornaments
on
the
back
verandah
where
they
would
be
easy
to
get
if
the
fires
threatened
the
house
deirdre
moved
restlessly
about
out
of
doors
watching
the
haze
on
every
side
of
the
clearing
for
any
sign
of
a
break
in
it
are
there
any
animals
on
the
place
mrs
cameron
she
asked
late
in
the
afternoon
only
a
couple
of
cows
and
lass
cameron
replied
they
in
the
top
paddock
i
run
them
down
deirdre
said
straddling
socks
and
calling
to
the
toothless
old
cattle
dog
who
lay
dozing
on
his
paws
before
the
kitchen
door
she
went
to
the
and
brought
down
the
cows
and
lass
a
few
minutes
later
keep
there
jock
she
said
and
left
the
old
dog
shepherding
them
in
the
yard
behind
the
barns
while
she
was
away
cameron
and
jenny
had
bundled
half
a
dozen
hens
and
a
game
rooster
into
a
big
wicker
crate
just
before
sunset
they
went
to
the
together
cameron
and
deirdre
and
jenny
buzzing
before
them
not
a
puff
of
air
stirred
the
tawny
curtain
that
obscured
the
hills
at
a
little
distance
the
trees
stood
motionless
the
light
leaves
of
the
young
gum
saplings
hung
with
a
stillness
that
had
tragedy
in
it
faint
and
far
away
in
the
silence
though
was
a
rushing
murmur
the
smell
of
burning
that
had
been
in
the
air
for
days
came
with
a
harsher
tang
darkness
was
making
way
against
the
neither
deirdre
nor
cameron
spoke
staring
into
it
a
flock
of
parroquets
flew
out
of
the
haze
and
scattered
across
the
clearing
with
shrill
startled
screams
a
little
brown
feathered
bird
dropped
into
the
grass
deirdre
picked
it
up
its
wings
are
singed
she
said
quickly
and
they
quite
hot
still
it
ca
have
flown
far
tense
and
alert
she
threw
back
her
head
a
puff
of
wind
feather
light
almost
imperceptible
touched
her
face
it
coming
from
the
west
she
breathed
will
you
take
the
animals
to
the
pool
deirdre
cameron
said
sharply
jock
keep
them
there
jenny
you
bring
the
beaters
up
here
i
stay
and
watch
to
see
if
the
fire
breaks
if
the
wind
from
the
west
it
strike
us
first
here
chapter
xiv
when
deirdre
returned
from
the
pool
where
she
had
left
lass
the
crate
of
fowls
and
the
cows
with
the
old
dog
standing
guard
over
them
cameron
was
already
beating
an
arrow
of
flame
that
had
struck
the
paddock
on
the
and
jenny
on
the
other
edge
of
the
fences
was
also
beating
darkness
had
fallen
the
glare
of
the
fire
was
visible
above
the
thick
standing
wall
of
haze
deirdre
saw
a
glittering
line
break
through
the
grass
at
a
little
distance
from
cameron
and
seizing
one
of
the
green
branches
jenny
had
thrown
down
in
the
centre
of
the
paddock
beat
the
fire
until
it
went
out
other
threads
of
fire
appeared
near
her
and
she
followed
them
along
the
fence
slashing
with
the
branch
until
they
died
down
leaving
blackened
earth
and
breaths
of
virulent
blue
smoke
stay
near
the
top
of
the
hill
deirdre
cameron
called
and
watch
to
see
if
there
a
break
on
the
front
clearing
or
the
pool
side
or
near
the
sheds
then
the
fire
began
to
show
in
a
dozen
places
at
once
wriggling
through
the
dry
grass
beating
became
automatic
an
unflagging
lashing
and
thrashing
and
watch
had
to
be
kept
that
the
enemy
was
not
attacking
in
another
part
of
the
clearing
the
blackened
earth
smoked
under
a
dead
flame
one
moment
the
next
a
spark
kindled
and
wispish
fire
was
running
through
the
grass
again
far
down
the
hillside
through
the
smoke
mists
to
deirdre
on
the
top
cameron
and
jenny
looked
in
their
white
cotton
dresses
the
fire
in
the
trees
of
which
these
swift
silent
runners
in
the
grass
were
was
still
some
distance
off
but
they
could
hear
the
crash
of
falling
trees
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
flames
in
the
tangled
leafage
shrill
cries
of
the
wild
creatures
of
the
bush
the
blare
and
bellowing
screams
of
cattle
cameron
light
skirt
caught
fire
jenny
beat
it
out
with
her
hands
she
and
cameron
fell
back
a
moment
the
glare
lighted
the
whole
of
the
clearing
in
the
valley
flashing
shafts
of
flame
could
be
seen
they
leapt
athwart
clouds
of
smoke
which
drove
billowing
across
the
sky
sprayed
by
showers
of
sparks
mrs
cameron
deirdre
screamed
warningly
as
a
steer
leapt
into
the
paddock
and
careered
across
it
into
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
the
heat
was
suffocating
the
heavy
acrid
smoke
in
their
lungs
made
their
heads
reel
deirdre
was
fighting
a
brilliant
patch
of
flames
across
the
paddock
when
cameron
called
to
her
it
no
good
child
she
said
her
face
was
dim
with
smoke
her
hands
burnt
and
blackened
it
no
good
trying
to
do
any
more
we
must
go
now
they
ran
from
the
to
the
house
cameron
caught
up
her
bundle
jenny
the
blue
vases
and
the
spinning
wheel
and
deirdre
taking
socks
from
the
stable
in
which
he
was
beginning
to
whinny
with
fear
led
him
down
the
track
in
front
of
the
house
they
were
half
way
across
the
clearing
when
cameron
came
to
a
standstill
flames
had
eaten
their
way
up
the
paddock
and
lay
across
the
track
we
cut
off
she
said
what
can
we
do
deirdre
asked
there
no
time
to
lose
jenny
screamed
dancing
up
and
down
beside
herself
with
terror
and
excitement
we
cut
off
cut
off
she
dropped
one
of
the
vases
she
was
carrying
and
it
broke
in
a
thousand
pieces
i
do
know
cameron
said
slowly
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
broken
pieces
of
the
vase
for
a
moment
deirdre
brain
was
paralysed
too
she
stood
staring
down
the
track
all
the
terrible
stories
of
the
fires
of
people
who
had
been
burnt
to
death
flashed
into
her
mind
a
shout
was
raised
behind
them
it
father
she
cried
the
schoolmaster
dashed
round
the
corner
of
the
house
his
face
was
blackened
and
had
angry
weals
where
the
fire
had
lashed
it
his
eyebrows
and
beard
were
singed
close
to
his
head
at
a
glance
he
took
in
the
situation
his
horse
with
head
hung
was
blowing
like
a
bellows
davey
just
behind
me
he
gasped
looking
at
cameron
cameron
and
he
did
know
the
fires
were
making
this
way
till
i
told
them
then
he
sent
davey
i
came
to
give
him
a
hand
never
thought
we
get
here
miles
of
fire
across
the
road
get
a
couple
of
blankets
deirdre
and
we
make
a
dash
for
the
creek
deirdre
ran
back
to
the
house
tore
the
blankets
from
the
beds
inside
and
threw
them
on
to
the
verandah
he
dipped
three
of
them
in
a
bucket
of
water
that
stood
by
the
kitchen
door
wrapped
her
in
one
and
cameron
and
jenny
in
the
others
davey
swung
into
the
yard
on
an
all
but
spent
horse

her

davey
the
schoolmaster
cried
and
get
down
to
the
water
i
look
after

mother

jenny
up
behind

fly
along
and

slip

grass

if
you
keep
him
at
it
davey
and
deirdre
dashed
across
the
smouldering
and
smoking
paddock
putting
their
horses
blindly
towards
the
corner
of
the
fence
where
the
were
already
down
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
behind
the
house
were
already
roaring
wrapped
in
the
smoke
and

up

over

a
hoarse
yelping
the

of

up

the
fire
did
not
reach
the
trees
above
the
pool
till
it
had
swept
the
orchards
sheds
and
house
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
cameron
watched
it
devouring
them
every
line
of
the
sheds
and
barns
the
eaves
and
corners
of
the
home
that
donald
and
she
had
made
was
struck
against
the
glare
the
stables
fell
with
a
crash
flames
went
up
from
the
new
weatherboard
corner
of
the
house
it
like
watching
someone
you
love
die
slowly
she
cried
a
breath
of
wind
brought
a
shower
of
blackened
and
burning
leaves
by
a
flank
movement
the
fire
was
sweeping
towards
them
the
wind
springing
up
gave
it
zest
it
sprang
in
long
brilliant
leaps
over
the
quivering
tops
of
the
trees
davey
and
the
schoolmaster
dropped
from
their
horses
cameron
deirdre
and
jenny
crouched
in
the
water
till
the
fury
of
the
flames
had
passed
over
their
heads
davey
had
his
hands
full
to
keep
the
cows
from
breaking
away
mad
with
terror
socks
the
most
restive
and
mettlesome
of
the
horses
started
and
whinnied
as
burning
leaves
struck
him
deirdre
threw
her
wet
blanket
over
him
and
cowered
next
to
him
under
it
murmuring
soothingly
there
now
steady
old
boy
steady
my
pretty
the
schoolmaster
held
his
own
horse
and
lass
startled
out
of
her
peaceful
phlegm
by
the
terrifying
roar
and
heat
even
when
the
flames
had
raced
on
over
the
it
was
not
safe
to
leave
the
pool
the
men
and
women
in
it
stood
in
water
to
their
waists
for
hours
a
red
haze
enveloping
them
the
blankets
dried
in
a
few
minutes
the
bush
behind
them
through
which
the
fire
had
passed
showed
trees
stripped
of
their
greenery
and
outlined
with
glowing
embers
some
of
the
dead
trees
beside
the
pool
burned
dully
and
fluttering
red
and
blackened
leaves
drifted
from
the
saplings
once
jenny
had
to
dip
to
her
neck
as
a
spark
of
fire
caught
her
dress
look
out
mrs
cameron
deirdre
cried
sharply
hearing
a
crack
and
seeing
a
glowing
bough
waver
over
davey
mother
the
schoolmaster
brushed
cameron
aside
and
the
bough
struck
his
face
deirdre
uttered
a
low
cry
davey
too
had
seen
the
movement
are
you
hurt
mr
farrel
he
asked
anxiously
no
it
is
anything
at
all
the
schoolmaster
replied
brusquely
with
a
half
laugh
cameron
herself
did
not
realise
what
had
happened
to
the
glare
of
the
fire
and
the
hot
red
mists
a
few
hours
before
dawn
succeeded
a
heavy
darkness
lit
only
by
the
columns
of
dead
trees
burning
to
ember
the
night
seemed
endless
when
the
first
wavering
gleam
came
in
the
eastern
sky
it
revealed
the
blackened
fringe
of
the
trees
their
green
waving
draperies
scorched
and
where
the
fire
like
a
ravening
monster
had
them
and
passed
on
the
wind
had
swept
the
haze
and
the
smoke
before
it
the
bosom
of
the
earth
lay
bare
of
the
light
dry
grass
that
had
covered
it
and
from
the
paddocks
and
blackened
forest
thin
spirals
and
breaths
of
bluish
smoke
rose
and
drifted
the
peaceful
space
of
trees
and
the
grasses
about
the
ayrmuir
homestead
were
gone
charred
outlines
of
sheds
and
what
of
the
house
was
still
left
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
the
wan
light
the
pool
mirrored
the
desolation
and
the
haggard
and
weary
men
and
women
who
stood
in
it
chilled
and
cramped
from
being
in
the
water
so
long
exhausted
with
the
anxieties
of
the
night
they
ventured
warily
back
to
the
still
hot
earth
cameron
eyes
turned
first
to
her
son
his
face
was
grimed
with
smoke
and
leaf
smuts
there
were
angry
red
flushes
on
it
where
scraps
of
burning
foliage
had
struck
him
deirdre
and
jenny
clothes
hung
to
them
scorched
and
dripping
there
were
burnt
holes
in
own
dress
farrel
and
davey
were
drenched
to
the
skin
the
schoolmaster
had
tied
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
covering
one
eye
in
the
first
light
of
the
dawn
deirdre
exclaimed
when
she
saw
it
father
she
cried
you
hurt
i
all
right
he
said
irritably
she
went
over
to
him
and
lifted
the
handkerchief
his
face
was
curiously
wrung
with
pain
and
blanched
beneath
the
tan
and
a
clammy
sweat
beaded
on
his
forehead
hold
your
tongue
deirdre
he
muttered
it
only
a
bit
of
a
burn
cameron
was
gazing
at
the
ruins
of
her
home
what
is
it
she
asked
hearing
his
voice
low
as
it
as
pitched
oh
you
got
a
bad
burn
she
went
towards
him
distress
in
her
eyes
it
nothing
at
all
it
does
matter
he
edged
away
from
her
so
that
she
should
not
see
when
you
and
davey
are
fixed
up
cameron
deirdre
and
i
must
get
along
and
see
how
steve
and
the
school
fared
they
found
some
flour
bread
and
tea
in
stone
jars
among
the
ruins
of
the
kitchen
davey
milked
the
cows
cameron
and
jenny
built
a
fire
in
the
yard
and
when
they
had
all
breakfasted
on
the
scorched
bread
and
some
tea
cameron
wanted
to
put
flour
on
the
schoolmaster
burn
but
he
said
that
it
was
not
worth
bothering
about
and
would
have
nothing
done
for
it
chapter
xvi
for
months
after
the
fires
every
settler
in
the
hills
was
felling
and
carting
timber
new
homes
were
built
on
the
débris
of
the
old
scarcely
a
house
in
the
district
had
escaped
the
hunger
of
the
flames
a
family
lived
in
a
tent
in
a
of
bagging
and
bark
or
in
what
was
left
of
the
walls
roofs
and
doors
of
houses
jammed
together
to
form
some
sort
of
shelter
against
the
weather
every
pair
of
hands
were
busy
trying
to
get
the
new
homes
up
before
the
autumn
rains
and
money
was
scarce
most
of
the
settlers
had
lost
cattle
and
horses
as
well
as
their
homesteads
sheds
and
crops
the
wind
that
had
driven
the
smoke
and
flames
billowing
before
it
brought
a
downpour
which
quenched
the
fire
the
morning
after
it
had
swept
the
southern
slopes
of
the
hills
for
days
it
rained
steadily
light
vertical
showers
soaked
into
the
blackened
earth
there
was
every
prospect
of
a
good
season
to
make
up
for
the
damage
done
by
the
fires
rain
on
fired
earth
makes
for
fertility
good
grain
fat
stock
and
an
abundant
harvest
the
settlers
worked
like
beavers
to
be
ready
for
it
the
prospect
of
a
good
season
heartening
their
labours
and
leavening
their
disappointment
at
having
again
to
do
all
the
building
and
fencing
that
had
been
done
only
a
few
years
before
the
only
places
in
the
district
that
remained
a
charred
monument
to
the
fires
were
the
school
and
the
cottage
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
were
living
at
steve
again
by
a
miracle
the
shanty
had
escaped
the
fires
it
remained
standing
when
scarcely
another
house
in
the
countryside
did
steve
and
two
teamsters
who
had
been
on
the
roads
had
spent
the
night
watching
that
flying
sparks
did
not
catch
its
splintery
grey
shingles
a
corrugated
iron
roof
had
saved
it
they
said
although
there
was
a
good
clearing
on
either
side
of
the
shanty
for
the
first
few
days
after
the
fires
while
the
rain
lasted
had
been
stretched
to
the
limit
of
its
capacity
to
shelter
homeless
men
women
and
children
the
men
camped
as
best
they
might
in
the
bar
in
the
kitchen
and
on
the
verandahs
ross
jess
deirdre
and
mackay
her
baby
and
three
small
boys
slept
in
one
room
and
when
steve
heard
that
morrison
and
kitty
who
had
wrapped
themselves
in
wet
blankets
and
crept
into
a
corrugated
iron
tank
while
the
fires
were
raging
around
them
had
no
shelter
but
the
tank
during
the
rain
the
schoolmaster
went
to
bring
them
into
the
shanty
and
steve
and
the
ross
boys
rigged
a
wind
and
rain
screen
of
boughs
and
bagging
round
the
verandah
to
make
another
room
for
them
deirdre
took
charge
of
the
domestic
arrangements
though
everybody
lent
a
hand
notwithstanding
the
terrible
experiences
every
member
of
the
house
party
had
passed
through
there
was
much
more
laughing
than
sighing
much
more
finding
of
humour
in
every
phase
of
awkward
predicaments
than
dilating
on
dangers
and
difficulties
losses
were
discussed
as
the
women
helped
deirdre
to
make
big
savoury
stews
and
put
bumper
loaves
on
the
ashes
of
steve
hearth
but
it
was
always
with
concluding
exclamations
of
gratitude
that
things
were
no
worse
at
dale
only
a
few
miles
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranges
three
mothers
were
weeping
for
little
ones
caught
in
the
flames
and
burnt
to
death
on
their
way
home
from
school
no
lives
had
been
lost
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
hills
all
day
the
men
were
out
riding
in
the
rain
trying
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
damage
done
they
ran
up
fences
mustered
stray
cattle
and
in
the
evening
brought
back
pitiful
accounts
of
beasts
burned
to
death
in
the
gullies
and
dry
when
they
sat
with
the
women
round
the
fire
in
steve
kitchen
their
great
boots
steaming
before
it
breathless
stories
of
fights
with
the
fires
were
told
most
of
the
men
had
been
away
taking
cattle
to
water
when
the
homesteads
were
attacked
the
flames
had
leapt
the
crest
of
the
range
and
circled
the
clearings
with
incredible
speed
the
women
had
to
do
the
best
they
could
to
save
the
children
the
animals
left
on
the
farms
and
the
buildings
and
many
a
good
fight
had
been
waged
before
they
sought
safety
themselves
it
rained
steadily
for
three
days
then
the
sunshine
gleamed
and
broke
up
the
men
restless
and
eager
to
repair
the
damage
that
had
been
done
were
off
at
dawn
the
women
and
children
followed
a
few
hours
later
in
lumbering
carts
and
some
of
them
were
going
to
make
a
of
boughs
and
bagging
or
of
oilskins
before
night
and
some
were
going
for
stores
to
the
port
or
to
the
new
township
that
was
springing
up
about
the
wirree
river
there
was
bound
to
be
plenty
of
work
for
every
pair
of
hands
for
months
to
come
while
everybody
was
busy
felling
fencing
splitting
and
running
up
new
buildings
it
was
rumoured
that
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
were
going
to
leave
the
hills
chapter
xvii
davey
had
said
to
the
schoolmaster
well
i
be
going
now
he
said
moving
away
clumsily
he
had
said
all
he
could
though
there
was
not
much
of
that
most
of
what
he
wanted
to
say
remained
deep
within
him
he
could
not
dig
it
up
the
words
to
express
his
feeling
would
not
come
he
had
muttered
something
about
passing
that
way
and
having
come
in
to
say
when
he
entered
the
big
bare
room
at
steve
he
had
not
seen
deirdre
nor
the
schoolmaster
since
the
night
of
the
fires
his
father
had
kept
him
busy
and
with
all
the
work
of
the
new
buildings
going
up
at
ayrmuir
there
was
plenty
to
do
he
talked
of
it
for
a
while
in
a
strained
uninterested
fashion
deirdre
told
me
mother
put
up
a
great
fight
for
the
house
he
said
but
of
course
the
old
man
does
give
her
credit
for
that
thinks
he
could
have
saved
it
if
he
had
been
on
the
spot
in
time
i
wish
he
had
been
there
i
like
to
seen
if
he
could
beaten
a
fire
with
that
wind
against
him
i
might
been
with
mother
a
bit
earlier
and
been
able
to
help
her
if
i
had
a
decent
nag
and
that
what
i
told
him
but
i
not
likely
to
get
one
the
expense
of
the
new
buildings
has
got
him
down
and
he
mad
because
nat
left
a
couple
of
hundred
yearlings
in
one
of
the
back
paddocks
we
ran
in
about
a
hundred
of
last
week
found
some
burnt
to
cinders
the
others
got
away
awkwardly
uncertainly
he
shifted
his
feet
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
say
the
final
words
and
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
stay
farrel
understood
that
and
kept
him
talking
longer
he
was
still
wearing
a
bandage
over
his
left
eye
your
eye
all
right
is
it
davey
asked
it
is
seriously
hurt
mother
was
asking
me
the
other
day
if
it
was
better
she
does
know
how
it
happened
mr
farrel
how
what
happened
farrel
asked
a
spasm
of
pain
twitched
his
lean
sunburnt
features
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
light
on
a
low
bench
under
the
window
how
you
got
that
burn
about
your
eyes
said
davey
but
i
saw
if
you
had
tried
to
prevent
the
branch
falling
on
mother
the
way
she
was
standing
it
would
have
come
down
on
her
face
it
might
have
fallen
on
any
of
us
the
schoolmaster
spoke
sharply
i
hope
you
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
with
it
davey
said
no
of
course
not
dan
rose
from
his
seat
under
the
window
you
be
wanting
to
say
to
deirdre
too
wo
you
davey
he
went
across
to
the
door
and
called
into
the
next
room
davey
going
deirdre
but
though
a
muffled
sound
of
someone
moving
came
from
it
there
was
no
answer
he
called
again
but
still
there
was
no
reply
she
must
have
gone
to
bring
in
the
cows
for
steve
the
schoolmaster
said
never
mind
i
tell
her
you
left
a
message
for
her
yes
said
the
boy
folding
and
his
hat
but
it
did
not
seem
the
same
thing
as
seeing
deirdre
and
saying
to
her
himself
mind
if
there
any
books
you
wanting
or
any
way
i
can
help
you
if
you
want
to
study
more
you
can
always
let
me
know
and
i
be
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
for
you
the
schoolmaster
said
steve
will
pass
a
letter
on
to
me
i
do
know
where
we
settle
at
first
or
just
what
we
going
to
do
but
he
generally
know
our
whereabouts
and
one
other
thing
i
like
to
say
davey
you
can
always
be
sure
of
a
friend
in
the
world
if
you
get
into
a
scrape
or
any
sort
of
trouble
will
you
remember
that
they
gripped
hands
thank
you
farrel
davey
muttered
but
i
wish
you
were
going
he
added
desperately
i
wish
we
were
too
farrel
said
with
a
sigh
but
then
you
see
people
do
want
to
build
the
school
again
they
do
think
the
same
need
for
one
now
most
of
the
girls
i
been
teaching
for
the
last
few
years
can
teach
the
children
coming
on
well
enough
and
besides
there
talk
of
government
schools
being
set
up
everywhere
yes
davey
countenance
was
one
of
settled
gloom
the
schoolmaster
wrung
his
hand
davey
found
himself
lifting
his
rein
from
the
docked
sapling
in
the
shanty
yard
two
other
horses
with
reins
hung
over
the
post
stood
before
bar
a
couple
of
cattle
dogs
lay
at
their
heels
nosing
the
dust
the
fowls
scratching
in
the
spread
their
wings
and
cackled
as
he
turned
out
of
the
yard
to
the
road
davey
the
schoolmaster
called
from
the
verandah
davey
replied
the
loose
gravel
rolled
under
his
mare
feet
as
she
slipped
and
slid
down
the
hill
the
reins
hanging
loose
on
her
neck
he
looked
straight
before
him
trying
to
understand
the
state
of
his
mind
he
had
not
expected
to
be
so
disturbed
at
taking
leave
of
the
schoolmaster
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
seen
deirdre
to
say
to
her
he
thought
for
the
first
time
he
realised
that
she
was
going
away
going
out
of
his
life
perhaps
that
realisation
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
his
thought
all
the
time
but
it
struck
him
suddenly
viciously
now
he
was
looking
into
the
distance
dazed
by
the
tumult
within
him
when
a
blithe
voice
called
him
and
glancing
up
he
saw
deirdre
standing
on
the
bank
by
the
roadside
there
you
are
davey
she
cried
going
away
without
saying
a
word
to
me
i
a
good
mind
to
let
you
go
she
was
breathless
with
running
across
the
paddocks
to
reach
the
turn
in
the
road
the
wind
had
blown
her
dark
hair
into
little
tendrils
about
her
face
and
there
was
a
sparkle
of
anger
in
her
eyes
i
heard
what
you
said
to
father
she
went
on
and
if
you
anything
better
to
say
to
me
i
go
back
davey
gazed
at
her
he
gazed
as
though
he
had
never
seen
her
before
she
seemed
another
creature
nothing
like
the
ragged
little
urchin
who
had
climbed
trees
with
him
and
ridden
to
school
behind
him
nothing
like
the
sedate
housewife
his
mother
had
made
of
her
either
deirdre
stared
at
him
too
as
though
he
were
quite
different
from
the
davey
she
had
known
a
shy
smile
quivered
on
her
lips
she
plucked
nervously
at
trails
of
the
which
overhung
the
bank
and
put
the
end
of
a
runner
between
her
teeth
and
chewed
the
stalk
davey
saw
that
her
lips
were
as
scarlet
as
the
flowers
that
like
butterflies
hung
at
the
end
of
the
trail
he
slid
off
his
horse
and
stood
facing
her
his
limbs
were
trembling
what
the
matter
she
asked
a
little
distress
creeping
into
her
voice
davey
face
was
tense
and
colourless
to
the
trouble
which
had
surprised
him
that
day
a
strange
soft
thrill
was
added
when
she
put
the
runner
stalk
with
its
scarlet
flowers
between
her
teeth
it
struck
him
with
a
strange
pang
that
deirdre
was
beautiful
that
her
lips
were
the
same
colour
as
the
flowers
hanging
near
them
it
was
all
translated
this
emotion
of
his
in
the
shamed
shy
smile
that
came
into
his
face
as
he
stared
at
her
deirdre
understood
well
enough
she
scrambled
down
the
bank
and
went
to
him
you
are
sorry
we
going
are
you
davey
she
asked
he
nodded
finding
he
could
not
speak
the
gloom
of
the
forest
was
closing
round
them
the
sunset
dying
she
sighed
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
after
a
few
moments
as
he
said
nothing
she
spoke
again
it
be
all
changed
i
suppose
when
father
and
i
come
back
she
said
we
come
back
by
and
by
sometime
you
know
father
says
we
come
to
see
steve
perhaps
but
we
be
grown
up
quite
you
and
i
davey
you
be
married
and
i
what
davey
had
wakened
i
was
saying
we
be
and
married
perhaps
by
the
time
we
see
each
other
again
deirdre
murmured
none
of
the
times
come
again
like
the
ones
when
we
went
home
on
lass
or
in
the
or
walked
and
chased
wallies
and
went
after
birds
nests
i
wish
they
could
i
wish
i
could
be
just
ten
when
i
come
back
and
give
you
a
race
down
the
road
davey
her
voice
ran
on
quickly
but
davey
mind
stuck
on
her
first
words
there
only
one
girl
i
be
married
to
he
said
yes
her
eyes
leapt
to
his
jess
ross
who
says
so
she
does
deirdre
laughed
she
says
she
the
only
girl
you
ever
kissed
and
her
mother
says
when
she
was
a
kid
they
put
her
face
up
to
me
but
i
never
kissed
her
or
any
girl
davey
said
i
did
believe
it
of
course
deirdre
laughed
softly
why
well
i
thought
if
there
was
any
girl
you
be
wanting
to
kiss
it
would
be
me
davey
the
bright
shy
glance
that
flew
towards
him
and
the
quiver
of
her
lips
fired
the
boy
his
arms
went
out
to
her
he
caught
her
shoulder
and
held
her
to
him
for
an
instant
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
night
or
day
but
when
he
withdrew
from
that
moment
of
unconsciousness
wild
uncontrollable
joy
and
possession
his
eyes
were
humid
and
her
eyes
beneath
his
were
like
pools
in
the
forest
which
the
mould
has
darkened
and
the
twilight
striking
through
the
trees
makes
a
dim
mysterious
mirror
of
deirdre
he
whispered
as
if
he
had
never
before
said
her
name
and
to
say
it
were
like
singing
in
church
he
kissed
her
again
slowly
and
tenderly
the
first
pressure
of
her
lips
had
made
a
man
of
him
you
my
sweetheart
are
you
deirdre
he
said
exultingly
holding
her
in
his
arms
and
gazing
down
at
her
when
you
come
back
we
be
married
yes
deirdre
whispered
her
eyes
reflected
the
glow
of
her
heart
i
always
meant
to
marry
you
davey
though
i
sometimes
pretended
i
liked
mick
ross
or
buddy
morrison
better
she
drew
a
little
sigh
but
i
so
glad
it
all
settled
now
and
we
really
going
to
marry
each
other
the
sunset
had
died
out
of
the
sky
and
the
forest
was
dark
about
them
when
they
kissed
and
whispered
for
a
little
while
davey
could
scarcely
say
the
words
he
watched
deirdre
as
she
fled
up
hill
to
the
shanty
then
leaping
on
his
horse
he
sent
her
clattering
down
hill
all
his
young
manhood
the
tumult
of
his
love
awakened
senses
rejoicing
and
dreams
orchestrating
within
him
chapter
xviii
in
the
earliest
days
of
port
southern
settlers
tracking
inland
or
further
along
the
coast
had
to
cross
the
wirree
driving
their
cattle
and
horses
before
them
the
shallows
of
the
river
where
they
crossed
began
to
be
called
the
wirree
ford
the
tracks
converged
there
and
it
was
not
long
before
a
shanty
appeared
on
the
left
bank
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
broad
and
river
the
wirree
came
down
from
the
hills
and
flowed
across
the
plains
at
the
foot
of
the
ranges
the
whole
of
the
flat
land
it
watered
was
spoken
of
as
the
wirree
river
district
or
the
wirree
the
stream
emptied
itself
into
the
waters
of
bass
straits
opposite
was
van
diemen
land
the
beautiful
green
island
on
which
penal
settlements
had
been
established
men
had
been
known
to
escape
from
it
to
the
mainland
they
made
the
dangerous
passage
of
the
straits
in
open
boats
and
sometimes
were
picked
up
in
an
exhausted
condition
by
a
frigate
policing
the
coast
or
a
trader
and
sent
back
to
hobart
town
or
port
arthur
sometimes
their
dead
bodies
were
tossed
by
the
sea
on
the
shores
they
had
been
trying
to
reach
and
sometimes
steering
by
the
muddy
waters
of
the
river
that
flowed
out
from
the
nearest
point
opposite
the
island
bearing
silt
and
for
a
couple
of
miles
into
the
sea
they
reached
the
land
of
promise
and
freedom
as
the
beaten
grass
path
along
the
seaboard
became
the
main
stock
route
between
port
southern
and
rane
a
settlement
at
the
further
eastern
end
of
the
coast
a
township
of
curious
mushroom
growth
cropped
up
about
the
wirree
ford
and
mcnab
shanty
it
was
a
collection
of
huts
wattle
and
dab
whitewashed
for
the
most
part
but
some
of
them
were
of
sods
plastered
together
or
of
the
stones
which
were
scattered
over
the
plains
or
filled
the
creek
beds
mcnab
weatherboard
shanty
with
its
of
a
black
bull
with
eyes
on
a
white
ground
was
by
far
the
most
pretentious
the
history
of
these
dwellers
about
mcnab
was
a
matter
of
suspicion
they
arrived
from
nowhere
out
of
the
night
silently
and
it
was
surmised
crept
up
the
river
in
the
boats
which
had
brought
them
over
the
straits
and
were
sunk
in
the
river
when
they
had
served
their
purpose
the
fertile
flats
stretching
to
the
edge
of
the
mountains
had
been
taken
up
before
mcnab
got
his
holding
on
an
arm
of
the
wirree
he
set
about
acquiring
the
selvedge
of
the
plains
which
was
cut
off
from
the
finer
more
arable
land
by
a
scrubby
line
of
densely
growing
most
of
the
wirree
ford
men
ran
cattle
on
these
strips
of
land
thrashed
by
the
sea
breezes
but
they
were
no
sticklers
for
the
niceties
of
boundaries
and
property
laws
they
drove
their
first
scraggy
herds
whither
they
listed
a
cursing
blasphemous
crew
none
dared
gainsay
them
it
was
reckoned
better
to
have
the
than
the
enmity
of
the
wirree
river
men
the
body
of
a
settler
who
had
threatened
to
have
the
law
of
them
for
grazing
their
beasts
on
his
land
was
a
few
days
afterwards
found
in
the
river
drifting
with
the
tide
out
to
sea
some
of
the
wirree
men
made
a
living
as
fishermen
others
maintained
themselves
by
a
desultory
farming
they
ploughed
the
grey
land
of
the
seaboard
with
wooden
but
many
of
them
thrived
on
what
they
could
make
out
of
the
stockmen
and
drovers
who
passed
through
the
township
on
their
way
to
rane
or
to
the
port
mcnab
was
powerful
enough
even
in
those
days
and
many
and
ingenious
were
the
stories
he
invented
to
account
for
the
presence
of
men
who
came
to
the
wirree
ford
unexpectedly
as
the
settlement
grew
it
did
justice
to
the
rumoured
accounts
of
its
origin
mcnab
was
the
meeting
place
of
stockmen
drovers
and
teamsters
on
the
southern
roads
and
the
carouses
held
there
were
it
was
recognised
as
a
hotbed
of
thieves
and
ruffians
by
the
roadsters
and
no
man
of
substance
or
any
pretensions
at
all
would
lodge
the
night
in
any
of
the
huts
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
river
before
long
the
wirree
men
had
fat
cattle
to
dispose
of
an
open
space
between
the
huts
not
far
from
mcnab
was
used
as
a
sale
yard
it
was
then
that
settlers
who
wanted
good
prices
for
their
beasts
had
to
drive
them
to
the
wirree
market
a
better
bargain
was
driven
in
the
wirree
square
than
anywhere
else
so
wirree
ford
became
wirreeford
and
thrived
and
prospered
until
it
was
the
busiest
cattle
market
in
the
south
to
a
certain
extent
its
prosperity
threw
an
air
of
respectability
over
it
at
first
and
farmers
from
the
hills
entered
the
township
in
the
morning
and
left
it
before
the
shadows
of
night
fell
they
did
their
business
and
left
the
wirree
not
much
better
off
for
their
coming
venturing
into
the
shanty
for
a
midday
meal
only
and
drinking
sparingly
if
at
all
of
the
curious
dark
spirits
it
vended
then
stores
were
opened
there
were
less
fearsome
comings
and
goings
mary
ann
hegarty
set
up
a
shanty
and
proceeded
to
business
with
an
air
of
great
propriety
women
and
children
were
brought
into
the
township
for
the
cattle
sales
sale
days
became
weekly
holidays
they
meant
the
donning
of
festive
ribbands
by
the
women
and
children
the
climbing
into
high
and
buggies
and
driving
along
the
winding
track
from
the
hills
to
the
township
where
groceries
dress
stuffs
and
household
furnishings
could
be
bought
and
stowed
in
the
back
of
the
carts
for
the
home
journey
sale
days
however
still
ended
in
gaming
and
drinking
brawls
at
the
shanties
and
sometimes
in
the
dropping
of
a
heavy
still
body
into
the
wirree
when
the
tides
would
carry
it
out
to
sea
it
was
the
disappearance
of
a
young
farmer
from
the
west
hills
after
a
night
at
the
black
bull
that
made
donald
cameron
decide
to
take
action
he
backed
by
other
farmers
and
hill
settlers
made
representations
to
the
port
authorities
as
to
the
lawless
character
and
conduct
of
wirreeford
township
a
trooper
who
rode
into
it
a
few
days
later
was
pelted
with
stones
tarred
and
feathered
and
sent
back
to
port
southern
then
a
building
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
township
a
ramshackle
house
built
of
overlapping
smooth
pine
shingles
it
was
whitewashed
so
that
it
stood
out
on
the
darkest
nights
to
remind
roisterers
that
law
and
order
were
in
their
midst
and
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
john
a
from
the
port
took
up
his
residence
in
it
he
mitigated
the
impression
that
undue
severity
would
be
meted
out
to
from
the
new
police
by
genially
brawling
with
most
of
his
neighbours
at
mcnab
as
soon
as
he
arrived
very
successfully
intimating
that
he
was
far
too
and
convivial
a
soul
to
interfere
with
the
wirree
little
way
of
doing
things
donald
cameron
was
well
known
in
wirreeford
when
it
began
to
be
a
cattle
market
of
importance
so
was
davey
young
davey
as
he
was
called
when
he
began
to
go
regularly
to
the
sales
in
the
years
that
followed
the
fires
cameron
worked
all
day
in
the
with
his
men
he
drove
in
his
own
beasts
in
the
morning
threw
off
his
coat
for
the
drafting
and
when
the
sales
were
over
went
out
of
the
township
a
stolid
stooping
figure
on
his
heavy
bay
cob
although
he
sometimes
made
close
on
a
thousand
pounds
on
a
day
sales
he
went
out
of
the
township
as
often
as
not
without
spending
a
penny
it
was
said
that
he
was
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
countryside
and
as
mean
as
they
make
yet
his
disinclination
to
spend
money
was
made
subservient
to
his
sense
of
justice
and
a
spirit
of
integrity
that
he
carried
round
with
him
made
the
wirree
people
regard
him
with
suspicious
awe
the
iron
quality
of
his
will
the
hard
straight
gaze
of
his
eyes
were
difficult
things
for
men
with
uneasy
consciences
to
encounter
because
he
was
the
first
man
in
the
country
it
was
reckoned
a
matter
of
prestige
to
have
the
patronage
of
donald
cameron
of
ayrmuir
whether
for
a
meal
store
order
or
any
job
whatever
in
jest
half
earnest
he
was
called
the
laird
of
ayrmuir
wirree
men
said
that
thad
mcnab
loathed
donald
cameron
as
the
devil
loathes
holy
water
mcnab
was
not
the
devil
in
their
eyes
nor
donald
cameron
holy
water
but
the
saying
perhaps
suggested
to
them
the
composite
forces
of
the
two
men
thad
with
his
twisted
mind
his
cruel
eyes
his
treacherous
underhand
ways
stood
to
them
for
something
in
the
nature
of
the
power
of
evil
donald
cameron
with
his
harsh
integrity
his
unbending
virtue
his
parsimony
and
sober
respectability
stood
for
something
in
the
nature
of
abstract
good
they
had
the
respect
for
him
that
people
sometimes
have
for
a
standard
which
has
been
hung
before
their
eyes
and
which
they
have
not
been
able
to
live
up
to
but
thad
was
their
aider
and
abettor
thad
for
all
his
tyrannies
blackmail
petulances
made
life
easier
for
them
they
stood
by
him
and
blessed
him
cursing
donald
cameron
and
his
sort
who
would
have
sent
them
back
to
the
prison
cells
and
torture
of
the
island
it
was
not
from
motives
of
sheer
kindness
that
mcnab
stood
by
them
they
knew
but
because
it
paid
him
nevertheless
the
thing
worked
out
in
the
same
way
donald
cameron
was
more
their
enemy
than
thad
thad
feud
with
him
amused
them
as
much
as
a
cock
fight
their
money
was
on
their
own
bird
and
they
barracked
for
him
idly
scoffing
at
his
enemy
almost
every
man
in
the
wirree
was
in
mcnab
debt
he
knew
more
about
their
lives
and
antecedents
than
was
to
their
soul
comfort
they
suspected
that
more
than
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
taken
back
to
the
island
had
been
put
away
by
mcnab
and
that
those
lean
crooked
hands
of
his
had
fingered
government
money
rewards
for
the
capture
of
escaped
convicts
but
so
long
as
they
were
in
with
thad
mcnab
wirreeford
men
with
pasts
that
would
not
bear
looking
into
thought
they
were
all
right
although
there
were
rumours
of
treacherous
dealings
on
his
part
with
simplicity
with
the
faith
of
the
desperate
they
trusted
mcnab
believing
that
he
stood
between
them
and
the
prisons
of
port
arthur
they
believed
that
if
they
were
in
with
thad
they
need
not
wake
sweating
out
of
their
sleep
at
the
thought
of
the
cat
or
worry
if
forgetful
of
consequences
they
gave
that
start
at
the
clank
and
rattle
of
irons
it
was
pretty
well
understood
that
thad
mcnab
and
sergeant
worked
together
thad
had
been
with
him
since
he
came
to
the
wirree
river
the
fact
sometimes
stood
unruly
spirits
in
good
stead
when
there
was
a
merry
night
at
the
black
bull
but
when
there
was
an
inconvenient
accident
over
the
cards
once
or
twice
and
when
there
was
a
on
the
rane
road
just
outside
the
township
too
it
was
conceded
that
had
earned
his
screw
thad
saw
to
it
that
occasionally
he
made
an
appearance
of
doing
his
duty
if
it
had
been
imagined
at
that
sergeant
winked
at
irregularities
in
the
application
of
the
law
at
wirreeford
he
might
have
been
moved
on
and
that
would
not
have
suited
the
landlord
of
the
black
bull
who
would
then
have
had
another
man
to
deal
with
or
have
found
that
another
man
was
dealing
with
him
donald
cameron
made
no
secret
of
his
attitude
to
mcnab
after
had
been
several
months
in
the
township
and
there
was
no
outward
or
visible
sight
of
his
having
mended
its
ways
cameron
made
representation
to
the
authorities
at
port
southern
and
through
them
to
the
powers
that
had
their
official
residence
in
melbourne
in
respect
to
thadeus
mcnab
position
and
breaches
of
the
law
in
wirreeford
he
was
clear
in
his
own
mind
that
there
was
a
case
against
mcnab
first
for
harbouring
convicts
escaped
from
van
diemen
land
and
secondly
for
being
the
possessor
of
a
still
and
for
turning
it
to
account
in
sly
grog
making
john
ross
mathew
morrison
and
the
rest
of
the
hill
folk
and
settlers
at
the
farther
end
of
the
plains
upheld
him
in
this
effort
to
rid
the
district
of
mcnab
but
although
an
inquiry
was
made
nothing
came
of
it
donald
cameron
gained
no
extra
popularity
in
the
wirree
on
the
first
of
his
counts
thad
position
was
if
anything
strengthened
by
hostility
every
man
in
the
township
knew
that
he
had
to
stand
by
mcnab
or
mcnab
would
not
stand
by
him
therefore
when
an
officer
from
the
port
came
to
investigate
conditions
in
wirreeford
he
found
nothing
to
take
exception
to
he
reported
that
the
local
police
officer
was
efficient
and
that
complaints
of
the
hill
settlers
were
due
to
a
personal
rancour
existing
between
donald
cameron
and
the
landlord
of
the
black
bull
thad
flourished
like
a
green
bay
tree
after
this
failure
to
move
him
and
forged
the
weapon
of
a
very
serviceable
hate
against
donald
cameron
he
kept
it
very
carefully
scabbarded
but
occasionally
it
leapt
forth
and
its
mettle
was
visible
to
all
and
sundry
ordinarily
thad
kept
a
locked
brain
it
was
only
in
rare
transports
of
rage
that
he
revealed
anything
of
its
crooked
workings
and
then
those
who
saw
them
looked
to
their
own
behaviour
and
were
careful
to
do
nothing
that
would
bring
them
into
its
toils
probably
nobody
but
cameron
himself
thought
mcnab
had
swallowed
that
little
business
of
the
inquiry
when
a
few
months
later
he
was
fawning
round
him
telling
him
that
dinners
were
to
be
served
at
the
bull
on
sale
days
and
that
his
patronage
would
be
an
esteemed
favour
those
who
heard
him
say
things
has
not
been
as
they
might
have
been
always
at
the
black
bull
cameron
you
have
had
reason
to
complain
in
the
past
but
everything
is
goin
to
be
different
for
the
future
could
not
believe
their
ears
it
was
very
humbly
with
a
flattering
deference
that
mcnab
had
asked
the
laird
to
help
him
to
improve
the
tone
of
the
place
by
occasionally
having
a
meal
in
it
donald
cameron
had
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
his
or
bread
and
cheese
sandwich
to
the
sale
yards
in
his
pocket
he
ate
his
lunch
there
at
midday
when
most
of
the
men
made
tracks
for
the
bar
opposite
but
after
a
while
he
took
his
meals
at
the
black
bull
lowering
not
a
whit
of
his
dignity
in
the
doing
of
it
and
treating
mcnab
as
curtly
in
his
own
establishment
as
he
did
anywhere
else
when
he
was
down
with
rheumatics
in
the
early
spring
the
place
had
open
doors
to
davey
he
was
served
like
a
duke
in
it
young
davey
promised
to
be
a
chip
of
the
old
block
the
wirree
said
he
worked
as
insatiably
as
the
old
man
and
was
no
more
than
a
roadmender
by
the
look
of
him
his
grey
trousers
had
many
a
patch
on
them
and
his
hat
was
as
weathered
a
bit
of
felt
as
was
seen
in
the
yards
he
walked
with
the
slouch
of
the
men
who
have
spent
most
of
their
days
in
the
saddle
when
he
flung
off
his
hat
it
was
seen
he
was
enough
with
an
air
of
breed
about
him
a
something
the
wirree
did
not
quite
get
there
was
a
great
deal
of
his
mother
in
the
cast
of
his
features
and
his
eyes
were
grey
and
green
like
hers
but
his
mouth
was
donald
cameron
set
in
a
boy
face
davey
was
a
shy
awkward
fellow
and
spoke
as
little
as
the
old
man
though
it
was
acknowledged
that
if
his
hand
was
as
rarely
in
his
breeches
pockets
as
his
father
it
was
because
there
was
nothing
in
them
it
was
well
known
that
donald
cameron
worked
his
son
like
a
convict
and
kept
him
on
short
commons
giving
him
neither
wages
nor
so
that
he
blushed
when
a
blackguard
asked
him
for
the
price
of
drink
and
he
had
not
got
it
to
give
he
fed
with
the
old
man
this
young
davey
cameron
and
was
never
seen
in
the
bars
few
of
the
men
who
entered
the
shanties
could
say
that
they
had
had
much
to
do
with
cameron
and
his
son
except
john
ross
and
the
morrison
boys
who
occasionally
dropped
into
mcnab
but
they
were
of
the
same
sort
hardworking
thrifty
respectable
homely
people
of
the
hills
who
despised
the
wirree
river
township
its
antecedents
descendants
and
associations
and
did
business
with
it
only
because
business
was
better
done
there
than
anywhere
else
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
had
been
gone
from
the
hills
for
over
a
year
when
wirreeford
began
to
make
concessions
for
the
sake
of
the
younger
generation
although
cards
were
shuffled
and
dice
were
thrown
at
the
black
bull
when
the
flickered
in
the
windows
after
the
sales
and
the
little
fires
of
lighted
before
the
doors
of
the
houses
to
keep
away
the
sandflies
and
mosquitoes
glowed
in
the
dusk
sending
up
faint
wreaths
of
blue
smoke
mary
ann
hegarty
threw
open
her
parlour
and
there
was
dancing
in
it
until
the
small
hours
the
hill
people
lent
the
countenance
of
their
presence
to
days
of
sports
and
to
the
dancing
at
hegarty
on
christmas
and
new
year
day
the
ross
boys
danced
with
wirree
girls
morrison
kitty
and
some
of
the
other
girls
from
the
hills
learnt
the
reels
and
jigs
that
their
parents
had
danced
in
the
country
beyond
the
seas
they
were
always
talking
of
the
old
people
danced
too
there
were
nights
of
wholesome
merriment
and
the
singing
of
old
songs
only
donald
cameron
and
his
wife
held
aloof
from
these
festivities
but
before
long
it
was
observed
that
young
davey
was
going
to
the
monthly
dancing
with
the
rosses
he
rode
down
from
the
hills
with
the
boys
and
jess
they
made
the
wirree
streets
ring
as
they
galloped
to
hegarty
and
their
laughter
streeled
out
on
the
wind
behind
them
as
they
went
home
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
even
the
roisterers
at
the
black
bull
had
fallen
asleep
in
uneasy
attitudes
about
its
verandahs
chapter
xix
it
was
not
every
day
there
was
dancing
at
mary
ann
only
on
fridays
after
the
cattle
sales
and
it
was
not
every
friday
that
pat
glynn
could
be
got
for
the
music
he
wandered
all
over
the
country
putting
the
devil
into
folks
heels
he
was
in
the
port
one
day
in
wirreeford
the
next
then
on
to
rane
or
off
wandering
somewhere
over
the
ranges
whenever
word
went
round
that
pat
was
coming
the
couples
gathered
from
every
direction
whether
they
danced
on
a
wooden
floor
or
on
the
grass
was
a
matter
of
little
importance
there
was
always
a
merry
time
when
pat
glynn
put
up
anywhere
for
the
night
he
came
trotting
into
wirreeford
on
the
day
of
the
early
november
sales
about
two
years
after
deirdre
and
the
schoolmaster
had
left
the
hills
the
township
was
full
of
dust
cattle
and
dogs
boys
yelling
drafting
and
beating
beasts
from
one
yard
to
another
men
watching
them
drovers
lean
men
and
auctioneers
horses
were
hanging
on
loose
reins
about
the
or
in
rows
with
drooping
heads
along
the
hitching
posts
at
the
black
bull
and
hegarty
two
or
three
heavy
family
were
drawn
up
before
the
store
where
the
women
with
children
about
them
were
shopping
buying
lengths
of
calico
dress
stuffs
or
groceries
and
ironmongery
to
take
home
to
the
hills
word
that
pat
glynn
was
at
hegarty
went
round
like
wildfire
so
at
mary
ann
it
was
that
all
the
miscellaneous
crowd
of
the
foregathered
they
danced
until
the
blood
boiled
under
leathern
faces
and
the
rising
sweat
left
furrows
in
the
dust
of
the
road
on
them
matted
lank
hair
lay
in
wet
streaky
locks
on
foreheads
marked
with
the
line
of
hats
that
almost
grew
on
them
the
line
beyond
which
the
sunburn
never
travelled
men
women
boys
and
girls
of
all
ages
children
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
pat
danced
them
all
to
a
state
of
breathless
exhaustion
as
he
tucked
his
fiddle
under
his
chin
and
raked
it
with
his
long
bow
his
eyes
gleamed
with
mischief
and
merriment
his
arm
went
backwards
and
forwards
so
dexterously
with
such
agility
that
the
gay
airs
he
played
possessed
him
as
well
as
everyone
who
heard
them
old
men
and
women
left
their
benches
by
the
wall
and
skipped
and
trundled
until
the
pine
floor
shook
the
only
people
who
were
not
dancing
were
a
young
mother
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
a
teamster
too
drunk
to
do
more
than
hang
by
the
doorpost
he
attempted
a
few
wild
and
hilarious
movements
fell
headlong
and
was
dragged
feet
foremost
to
the
door
and
thrown
out
because
he
cumbered
the
floor
the
young
mother
joggled
her
baby
and
sang
softly
in
tune
to
pat
music
enfolding
the
assembled
company
and
pat
himself
in
her
beaming
smile
it
was
incense
to
pat
soul
to
see
everybody
within
earshot
moving
the
clatter
rhythmic
lift
shuffle
and
thump
of
feet
was
as
good
to
his
ears
as
any
of
the
old
airs
he
played
his
arm
flying
quicker
and
quicker
sent
old
and
young
along
with
the
strain
of
his
music
like
corks
on
a
stream
heads
bobbed
feet
stamped
busily
a
catch
of
laughter
flew
out
the
elderly
stout
mother
of
a
family
called
breathlessly
stop
it
pat
stop
it
ye
villain
but
pat
only
laughed
and
his
fiddle
arm
flew
faster
till
the
dancers
dropped
exhausted
against
the
wall
or
hung
there
gasping
with
a
stitch
in
their
sides
when
he
had
tired
them
all
out
he
lifted
his
bow
with
a
flourish
and
a
shout
of
laughter
the
two
that
kept
the
floor
longer
than
most
others
were
jess
jess
as
she
was
called
and
young
davey
cameron
they
were
reckoned
a
fine
pair
of
dancers
pat
had
great
pride
in
them
when
everybody
else
had
left
the
floor
he
made
the
pace
faster
and
faster
for
them
till
they
whirled
to
a
finish
watched
and
cheered
by
the
crowd
against
the
walls
and
derelicts
of
the
wirree
whom
hegarty
would
not
have
to
dance
in
her
parlour
had
to
amuse
themselves
by
looking
in
the
doorway
or
by
jigging
as
best
they
might
out
of
doors
under
the
sky
it
was
that
night
of
the
november
sales
when
pat
was
at
hegarty
that
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
came
back
to
the
wirree
they
put
up
at
the
black
bull
and
it
was
not
until
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
that
they
appeared
in
hegarty
doorway
pat
was
speeding
up
a
reel
his
eyes
kindling
faith
it
a
drop
of
the
craythur
you
want
to
waken
you
up
mick
ross
he
called
catching
up
the
air
of
his
tune
he
sang
gaily
and
the
company
joined
in
breathlessly
at
the
top
of
its
lungs
he
broke
from
the
song
into
expostulation
and
explanation
there
the
darlin
boy
buddy
morrison
he
cried
tears
of
laughter
running
down
his
withered
cheeks
but
he
break
morrison
back
for
her
let
you
be
gentle
with
the
girl
buddy
it
a
young
lady
sir
not
a
heifer
ye
have
by
the
horns
it
was
when
davey
and
jess
were
having
their
last
fling
against
music
and
he
scraping
for
all
he
was
worth
to
beat
them
in
their
whirling
and
turning
that
jess
saw
a
tall
girl
watching
them
on
the
outskirts
of
the
people
who
had
just
stopped
dancing
she
knew
her
at
once
her
dark
eyes
white
skin
the
black
hair
that
swept
back
from
her
face
it
was
deirdre
deirdre
grown
very
tall
and
lithe
and
deirdre
in
a
dark
dress
with
a
necklace
of
red
beads
about
her
neck
and
a
blue
ribband
round
her
waist
jess
knew
what
the
look
in
her
eyes
meant
as
she
watched
the
dancing
she
knew
and
her
heart
exulted
deirdre
would
see
that
davey
and
she
had
become
great
friends
while
she
was
away
he
had
not
seen
the
girl
in
the
doorway
he
flung
jess
backwards
and
forwards
flushed
and
excited
spurred
on
by
the
music
and
the
test
of
keeping
step
losing
no
movement
of
hers
to
be
even
with
pat
when
he
drew
his
last
chords
jess
flew
with
him
davey
saw
no
more
of
her
than
her
sonsy
face
surrounded
with
the
fair
wisps
of
curls
her
grey
eyes
came
to
him
and
her
lips
parted
and
smiled
as
her
arms
went
out
to
him
she
stumbled
and
fell
breathlessly
at
the
last
he
had
to
hold
her
to
prevent
her
falling
when
up
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
recovered
his
breath
his
eyes
were
shining
his
laughter
rang
out
a
gay
challenge
in
it
how
that
for
a
finish
pat
oh
ye
a
deevil
davey
the
old
man
cried
mopping
his
forehead
jess
had
put
herself
before
davey
and
his
view
of
the
door
but
he
had
moved
to
call
to
the
fiddler
he
saw
the
group
there
and
stood
staring
for
a
moment
the
colour
ebbed
from
his
face
he
recognised
the
schoolmaster
though
he
wore
a
shade
over
one
eye
now
but
it
was
the
sight
of
the
dark
head
the
turn
of
a
girl
shoulder
and
back
near
him
that
was
a
shock
to
davey
the
great
moment
had
come
deirdre
had
returned
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
room
men
and
women
gathered
about
her
and
the
schoolmaster
davey
heard
her
voice
ring
out
the
sound
of
it
thrilled
him
and
left
him
trembling
it
seemed
only
yesterday
that
she
had
gone
and
yet
it
was
ages
three
years
they
had
written
once
or
twice
at
first
but
somehow
the
letters
had
stopped
he
had
not
heard
from
her
for
a
long
time
what
could
he
do
what
a
lot
there
would
be
to
tell
her
he
wanted
to
show
her
his
new
horse
a
sturdy
that
he
had
coveted
on
sight
and
had
induced
his
father
to
buy
would
he
ever
be
able
to
go
and
speak
to
her
he
wondered
his
legs
shook
so
would
he
be
able
to
speak
his
throat
ached
did
she
know
that
he
davey
her
sweetheart
was
there
against
the
wall
so
full
of
love
for
her
that
he
could
not
move
that
he
could
only
gaze
at
her
if
only
she
would
come
to
him
if
only
the
whole
of
mary
ann
room
would
fall
away
from
them
leave
them
just
deirdre
and
he
together
he
did
not
see
jess
did
not
realise
that
she
was
watching
him
with
a
pain
in
her
eyes
at
the
wonder
and
adoration
of
his
it
deirdre
she
said
as
if
for
her
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
yes
he
breathed
he
could
hear
deirdre
laughing
and
chattering
with
the
men
and
girls
who
had
been
to
school
with
her
when
she
and
the
schoolmaster
lived
in
the
hills
the
schoolmaster
had
gone
out
of
doors
again
but
where
he
had
been
a
long
drover
of
maitland
conal
fighting
conal
was
standing
leaning
against
the
wall
and
smiling
down
on
her
beneath
the
inexplicable
exhilaration
the
tingling
thrilling
joy
which
possessed
davey
a
slow
wrath
surged
at
the
way
conal
looked
and
smiled
at
deirdre
and
at
the
way
she
looked
her
eyes
leaping
up
to
his
and
smiled
at
conal
but
she
was
his
his
sweetheart
and
had
promised
to
marry
him
davey
told
himself
and
the
resurgent
joy
at
seeing
her
flooded
him
are
you
going
to
dance
davey
jess
asked
anxiously
when
pat
began
to
fiddle
again
no
he
said
if
you
not
going
to
can
i
have
this
one
with
jess
asked
buddy
morrison
with
restrained
eagerness
what
davey
asked
his
eyes
on
deirdre
if
you
not
can
i
have
this
one
with
jess
repeated
bud
morrison
his
face
and
ruddy
hair
was
responsible
for
his
youthful
appearance
although
he
was
older
by
a
couple
of
years
than
davey
he
was
jess
most
humble
adorer
but
his
grief
was
that
she
would
never
look
at
him
if
davey
was
looking
at
her
oh
yes
davey
replied
he
watched
jess
and
buddy
morrison
go
out
among
the
dancers
his
eyes
flew
back
to
where
deirdre
had
been
standing
but
she
was
dancing
with
conal
a
lightning
tremor
of
surprise
flickered
through
him
he
caught
his
breath
that
anybody
but
himself
would
dance
with
deirdre
had
not
occurred
to
him
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
her
after
the
dance
what
right
had
conal
to
dance
with
her
he
was
caught
in
a
cloud
of
troubled
thought
and
dismay
davey
watched
them
dancing
this
tall
slender
girl
with
her
hair
knotted
up
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
the
bearded
man
who
had
come
to
the
sales
for
sam
maitland
he
could
dance
he
and
deirdre
were
dancing
as
the
people
in
wirreeford
had
never
seen
folk
dancing
and
conal
dark
handsome
face
was
turned
down
to
the
girl
it
was
not
the
dance
he
was
thinking
of
but
her
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
as
they
covered
her
every
movement
was
tender
of
her
jess
in
a
fury
of
impatience
with
her
partner
dragged
him
off
the
floor
he
was
heavy
and
slow
on
his
feet
missed
the
time
and
muddled
his
steps
in
order
not
to
disgrace
her
own
dancing
she
had
to
fall
back
against
the
wall
when
deirdre
came
away
from
the
dancers
with
her
tall
partner
davey
went
round
to
where
they
were
standing
once
only
he
had
seen
her
flash
a
swift
glance
round
the
room
then
her
eyes
had
not
rested
on
him
at
all
but
skimmed
past
him
like
swallows
in
flight
he
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
him
now
that
he
stood
near
her
his
heart
throbbed
she
laughed
and
chattered
with
the
people
about
her
davey
caught
a
word
or
two
of
her
greetings
to
old
schoolfellows
conal
bent
over
her
appropriatingly
deirdre
flashed
a
smile
at
him
as
she
talked
davey
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
a
little
hurt
feeling
began
to
grow
in
him
would
he
never
catch
her
eye
would
she
never
look
his
way
pat
was
calling
for
another
dance
the
little
crowd
shifted
and
drifted
away
from
deirdre
mick
ross
had
the
temerity
to
ask
her
if
she
would
dance
with
him
davey
heard
him
and
he
heard
long
conal
drawl
lazily
in
reply
the
man
that
dances
with
deirdre
will
have
to
with
me
well
i
not
wanting
to
with
you
conal
mick
replied
laughing
and
withdrew
to
find
another
partner
davey
eyes
sparkled
he
walked
up
to
where
deirdre
stood
in
the
doorway
with
the
drover
will
you
dance
with
me
deirdre
he
said
why
she
exclaimed
blithely
much
as
he
had
heard
her
exclaim
to
a
dozen
others
it
davey
cameron
grown
up
i
never
known
you
davey
but
for
the
scar
on
your
neck
where
the
calf
kicked
you
do
you
remember
the
day
we
were
taking
him
up
to
steve
in
the
davey
and
i
used
to
have
great
times
at
the
school
she
explained
with
a
glance
for
conal
this
is
conal
you
know
long
conal
davey
fighting
conal
they
call
him
do
they
she
went
on
with
a
little
mischievous
inflection
in
her
voice
yes
i
know
said
davey
will
you
dance
with
me
deirdre
few
people
south
of
the
ranges
did
not
know
or
had
not
heard
of
fighting
conal
of
sally
the
yellow
streak
of
a
cattle
dog
half
dingo
that
he
swore
by
and
of
his
three
parts
bred
mare
ginger
ginger
for
pluck
conal
said
and
that
was
why
she
got
her
name
though
he
had
his
title
to
live
up
to
conal
was
a
prime
favourite
on
the
roads
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
another
name
but
nobody
ever
bothered
about
it
conal
fighting
conal
was
a
good
enough
name
for
any
man
to
go
by
it
was
reckoned
there
was
talk
under
the
breath
of
sometimes
when
he
was
mentioned
but
it
was
always
under
the
breath
for
conal
was
a
man
with
a
fist
that
could
punish
any
reflections
on
his
character
as
thoroughly
as
the
fist
of
a
man
had
ever
been
known
to
but
he
was
a
lightsome
swaggerer
a
reckless
sort
of
bully
then
if
you
know
said
conal
coolly
you
better
have
gone
home
and
to
bed
young
shaver
before
havin
asked
deirdre
to
dance
with
you
i
do
like
any
interference
with
the
partners
i
choose
for
meself
it
was
all
said
with
a
lazy
air
conal
was
sure
of
himself
he
reviewed
with
faint
amusement
this
youngster
who
made
claims
to
privileges
that
he
had
reserved
to
himself
for
the
evening
will
you
dance
with
me
deirdre
davey
asked
again
his
eyes
blazed
he
trembled
with
anger
well
i
conal
straightened
and
swore
amazedly
but
deirdre
hand
caught
his
sleeve
we
missing
all
this
dance
she
said
quickly
as
she
turned
away
on
his
arm
her
eyes
swung
round
to
davey
go
and
find
jess
she
said
you
looked
such
a
pretty
couple
dancing
together
when
i
came
in
her
laughter
and
little
speech
stupefied
davey
he
forgot
his
anger
forgot
conal
forgot
the
roomful
of
dancers
stampeding
merrily
forgot
pat
glynn
and
his
music
he
forgot
everything
but
that
deirdre
was
laughing
at
him
her
words
tingled
in
his
ears
he
had
heard
her
laughter
deirdre
his
sweetheart
was
laughing
at
him
deirdre
who
had
promised
he
stumbled
out
of
the
room
chapter
xx
davey
the
schoolmaster
voice
went
out
with
a
glad
note
in
it
he
turned
aside
from
the
men
who
were
talking
with
him
outside
parlour
his
arm
stretched
to
grip
the
boy
hand
but
davey
swung
past
he
did
not
see
or
hear
he
did
not
even
know
where
he
was
going
he
walked
through
darkness
surging
darkness
though
the
night
was
a
clear
one
stars
on
the
screen
of
the
sky
the
houses
of
the
wirree
were
white
in
the
light
deep
shadows
were
cast
back
from
their
walls
as
they
squatted
against
the
earth
davey
turned
the
angle
of
the
house
into
the
stable
yard
instinct
carried
him
to
it
and
to
the
fence
where
his
horse
was
tethered
there
was
a
fluttered
cackle
of
fowls
a
startled
yelping
of
dogs
as
he
threw
on
his
saddle
and
turned
out
of
the
yard
taking
the
road
to
the
hills
the
men
outside
hegarty
smoking
and
swopping
yarns
with
the
schoolmaster
watched
him
go
sparks
of
white
fire
flew
from
his
hoofs
as
they
beat
along
the
road
young
davey
riding
as
though
the
devil
were
at
his
heels
someone
remarked
through
teeth
that
gripped
a
pipe
never
seen
him
ride
like
that
before
thad
mcnab
said
farrel
did
not
speak
he
wondered
too
what
it
was
had
sent
the
boy
out
into
the
night
like
that
half
an
hour
before
he
had
seen
him
dancing
with
jess
ross
and
his
face
had
just
such
a
look
as
his
mother
might
have
had
when
she
was
his
age
and
dancing
he
looked
back
into
the
room
jess
was
sitting
a
very
forlorn
dejected
little
figure
on
a
bench
by
herself
deirdre
was
dancing
with
conal
instinctively
he
associated
davey
going
with
deirdre
they
had
been
such
good
friends
when
they
were
children
and
he
had
imagined
that
they
would
be
so
glad
to
meet
each
other
again
he
followed
deirdre
as
she
danced
with
conal
conal
was
an
old
friend
of
his
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
since
they
left
the
hills
and
few
men
had
the
place
in
the
schoolmaster
regard
and
affection
that
long
conal
had
he
had
been
with
them
on
several
of
their
wanderings
and
deirdre
and
he
had
always
seemed
to
get
on
like
brother
and
sister
together
he
thought
but
now
he
saw
the
gleam
in
conal
eyes
as
he
bent
over
her
the
tenderness
in
his
swarthy
face
deirdre
smile
her
swift
glances
shy
and
alluring
her
averted
head
the
way
she
laughed
and
moved
were
a
revelation
to
him
so
deirdre
a
woman
and
at
woman
tricks
he
thought
she
had
been
a
child
to
him
till
this
night
conal
with
his
sunburnt
bearded
face
his
rough
hands
his
eyes
bright
with
love
and
laughter
had
made
a
woman
of
her
he
told
himself
and
what
had
she
made
of
him
the
schoolmaster
saw
his
eyes
on
her
neck
where
the
dark
curls
gathered
dewily
he
knew
as
much
as
there
was
to
be
known
of
long
conal
knew
that
he
had
flirted
and
drunk
and
sworn
his
way
along
all
the
stock
routes
in
the
country
he
had
kissed
and
ridden
away
times
without
number
but
there
was
something
else
in
his
eyes
now
something
that
promised
he
would
never
want
to
ride
far
or
long
from
the
sight
of
deirdre
the
schoolmaster
was
sure
of
that
for
a
moment
he
saw
the
averted
face
the
curve
of
her
white
neck
the
little
tendrils
of
hair
clustering
moist
and
jetty
about
her
ears
her
scarlet
fluttering
lips
as
conal
might
have
seen
them
she
a
beautiful
woman
deirdre
an
voice
jerked
suddenly
behind
him
with
sly
chuckling
laughter
it
was
thad
mcnab
who
spoke
he
grudged
hegarty
her
gathering
of
young
people
and
the
patronage
of
pat
glynn
but
then
she
was
able
to
run
the
place
better
than
he
and
although
it
was
supposed
to
be
her
property
none
knew
better
than
the
two
of
them
that
it
was
his
as
much
as
the
black
bull
mcnab
came
and
stood
in
mary
ann
doorway
sometimes
when
there
was
dancing
and
the
joy
of
several
of
the
dancers
was
quenched
at
the
mere
sight
of
his
shrivelled
yellow
face
and
pale
eyes
the
schoolmaster
looked
down
at
him
no
man
could
afford
to
quarrel
with
mcnab
how
old
will
she
be
now
asked
mcnab
eighteen
replied
the
schoolmaster
she
the
prettiest
girl
ever
seen
down
this
part
of
the
world
muttered
old
salt
watson
conal
seems
to
think
so
it
was
johnnie
who
laughed
and
who
conal
to
think
so
is
any
girl
on
the
roads
good
enough
for
him
to
play
the
fool
to
asked
mcnab
waspishly
best
not
let
him
hear
you
say
so
thad
mcnab
shook
his
shoulders
i
not
frightened
of
conal
the
rest
of
ye
may
be
still
you
would
like
that
fist
of
his
about
you
thad
salt
watson
murmured
and
conal
is
what
y
might
call
a
respecter
of
persons
when
he
roused
the
schoolmaster
went
into
the
he
crossed
it
in
leisurely
fashion
and
went
to
jessie
she
was
sitting
staring
before
her
a
mist
of
tears
dimming
her
pretty
eyes
he
did
not
go
near
deirdre
did
not
look
at
her
even
but
conal
dropped
her
hand
when
the
schoolmaster
came
into
the
room
and
a
faint
fear
that
had
fluttered
in
deirdre
eyes
vanished
a
little
later
she
came
to
him
with
a
breath
that
was
almost
a
sob
ca
we
go
now
she
said
looking
into
her
eyes
he
saw
the
shine
of
tears
in
them
he
had
meant
to
talk
very
seriously
to
her
on
their
way
from
hegarty
but
now
she
demanded
tenderness
and
not
reproof
she
seemed
to
have
stumbled
against
something
she
did
not
understand
she
had
dropped
her
armour
of
gaiety
all
her
shy
bright
glances
smiles
sighs
and
little
airs
and
graces
she
had
been
playing
with
these
women
weapons
and
had
wearied
of
them
or
perhaps
she
was
surprised
at
their
power
and
troubled
by
it
he
thought
there
was
a
hurt
expression
he
had
never
seen
before
in
her
eyes
she
looked
very
young
and
tired
he
wrapped
her
up
in
her
shawl
took
her
by
the
arm
and
they
went
out
into
the
moonlight
together
making
their
way
to
the
black
bull
where
they
were
staying
until
they
could
find
another
home
in
the
district
chapter
xxi
in
the
wirree
farrel
was
never
known
as
anything
but
the
schoolmaster
everybody
called
him
that
even
deirdre
when
she
spoke
of
him
they
had
gone
to
live
in
a
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
the
township
the
schoolmaster
had
taken
up
his
old
trade
though
it
was
understood
he
had
been
droving
with
conal
for
maitland
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
had
been
away
deirdre
had
wandered
with
him
wherever
he
went
and
it
was
on
her
account
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
steadier
and
more
settled
ways
of
life
it
was
said
before
long
two
or
three
of
the
wirree
children
were
trotting
to
the
cottage
for
lessons
every
day
the
south
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
sam
maitland
head
of
the
firm
of
maitland
of
cooburra
new
south
wales
there
had
been
a
bad
season
in
the
for
a
couple
of
years
maitland
had
bought
up
poor
beasts
and
sent
them
to
fatten
in
the
south
conal
had
been
driving
them
through
wirreeford
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
months
taking
the
fattened
beasts
back
on
the
return
journey
over
the
border
after
he
brought
down
the
starvers
all
the
week
the
township
slept
peacefully
in
the
spring
sunshine
when
a
clear
young
moon
came
up
over
the
plains
in
the
evenings
it
drenched
them
with
wan
silver
light
but
on
friday
morning
at
dawn
the
cattle
came
pouring
into
the
town
with
a
cracking
of
whips
barking
of
dogs
yelling
and
shouting
of
men
and
boys
with
a
rush
and
a
rattling
of
horns
they
charged
along
between
the
rows
of
huddled
houses
swinging
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
track
wild
and
with
lowered
heads
long
strings
of
glistening
saliva
dripping
from
their
mouths
they
seemed
to
be
searching
for
the
opportunity
to
break
and
head
out
to
the
hills
again
but
ringed
with
cracking
whips
brushing
horses
snapping
dogs
they
were
turned
into
the
the
one
street
of
wirreeford
had
been
cobbled
for
some
distance
on
either
side
of
the
because
the
cattle
and
horses
made
a
sea
of
mud
about
them
when
the
spring
rains
had
soaked
into
the
soft
earth
the
stores
and
shanties
were
full
on
sale
days
drovers
men
with
faces
seared
and
seamed
with
the
dust
of
the
roads
hands
burnt
and
broken
with
barcoo
slouched
along
the
streets
or
stood
watching
their
cattle
yarning
in
desultory
fashion
leaning
over
the
rails
of
the
drafting
yards
they
smoked
or
chewed
and
spat
in
front
of
the
shanties
and
at
night
sprawled
over
the
table
at
the
black
bull
playing
cards
or
tossing
dice
a
mob
that
had
travelled
a
long
way
was
often
yarded
the
night
before
the
sales
when
the
selling
for
the
day
was
over
the
beasts
that
had
come
down
from
the
hills
were
driven
out
along
the
rane
road
and
got
under
way
for
the
northern
markets
but
sometimes
they
were
left
in
the
yards
lowing
and
bellowing
all
night
while
the
stockmen
who
were
going
to
take
charge
of
them
spent
the
evening
at
the
black
bull
or
mary
ann
the
township
was
full
of
the
smell
of
cattle
and
dogs
and
of
the
muddy
river
that
had
become
a
for
the
houses
in
the
early
spring
breezes
from
the
ocean
with
a
tang
of
salt
in
them
blew
right
through
the
houses
and
later
when
the
trees
by
the
river
blossomed
and
bore
masses
of
golden
down
a
warm
sweet
musky
fragrance
was
wafted
to
their
very
doors
it
overlaid
the
reek
of
the
cattle
yards
the
fumes
of
rank
spirits
and
tobacco
that
came
from
the
shanties
and
in
the
long
glimmering
twilights
when
the
light
faded
slowly
from
the
plains
and
the
wall
of
the
hills
changed
from
purple
to
blue
and
misty
grey
they
were
caught
up
into
the
mysterious
darkness
of
the
night
those
perfumes
of
the
lightwood
and
wattle
trees
in
blossom
and
rested
like
a
benediction
in
the
air
from
their
shabby
whitewashed
hut
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
could
watch
the
twilight
dying
on
the
plains
and
breathe
all
the
fragrance
of
the
trees
by
the
river
when
they
were
in
bloom
the
plains
spread
in
vivid
undulating
green
before
the
cottage
to
the
distant
line
of
the
hills
and
the
grass
was
full
of
wild
flowers
all
manner
of
tiny
shy
and
starry
blue
and
white
and
yellow
flowers
deirdre
had
watched
davey
bring
cattle
down
from
the
hills
across
the
plains
she
had
seen
him
riding
off
runaways
once
a
heifer
had
broken
and
careered
over
the
plains
before
the
cottage
davey
had
chased
after
her
at
breakneck
speed
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
had
swept
his
round
her
letting
it
fall
on
her
plushy
hide
with
ripping
cracks
he
had
flogged
the
beast
driving
her
with
strings
of
oaths
his
dog
a
black
and
tan
fury
yelping
and
snapping
at
her
nozzle
until
the
blood
streamed
from
it
and
with
a
mutinous
bellow
she
turned
back
to
the
mob
again
deirdre
had
watched
him
going
home
in
the
evening
with
his
father
or
some
of
cameron
men
at
the
heels
of
a
mob
his
eyes
going
straight
out
before
him
he
never
looked
her
way
or
seemed
to
see
her
where
she
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
whitewashed
cottage
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
river
she
had
been
chasing
mary
ann
geese
from
the
river
across
the
green
paddock
that
lay
between
the
shanty
and
the
schoolmaster
house
when
davey
rode
out
of
the
township
towards
her
one
evening
he
was
driving
a
score
or
so
of
weedy
straggling
calves
deirdre
stood
by
the
roadside
and
waited
for
him
her
eyes
luminous
in
the
dusk
the
wind
had
whipped
her
hair
to
the
long
tendrils
it
used
to
hang
in
when
they
raced
each
other
along
the
roads
from
school
davey
she
called
as
he
came
towards
her
there
was
appeal
in
her
voice
but
davey
stared
at
her
as
though
he
had
not
seen
her
and
passed
on
you
a
rude
horrible
boy
and
i
hate
you
hate
you
hate
you
she
cried
passionately
after
him
when
they
met
again
it
was
near
the
when
the
street
was
thronged
with
people
from
the
hills
she
had
seen
his
horse
hitched
to
the
posts
outside
mcnab
and
so
was
ready
for
him
when
they
passed
the
path
was
so
narrow
that
they
could
not
avoid
brushing
but
chin
was
well
up
and
her
eyes
very
steady
when
they
met
his
under
his
hat
brim
such
gloomy
morose
eyes
they
were
that
she
looked
into
she
almost
exclaimed
with
surprise
at
them
her
mouth
opened
to
speak
but
davey
was
as
intent
on
passing
as
she
had
been
his
face
had
an
ugly
sullen
look
something
of
his
father
dourness
after
he
had
passed
she
stood
still
and
watched
him
he
crossed
the
road
and
went
into
the
black
bull
the
schoolmaster
saw
him
there
in
the
evening
it
was
not
often
farrel
was
seen
in
the
of
the
black
bull
though
there
was
always
a
lighting
of
eyes
a
shifting
of
seats
in
anticipation
of
a
lively
evening
when
he
appeared
he
wondered
what
davey
cameron
was
doing
there
his
father
had
been
crippled
with
rheumatism
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
davey
had
charge
of
his
business
farrel
wondered
if
he
had
begun
to
swagger
to
give
himself
airs
on
the
strength
of
it
he
seemed
on
good
terms
with
mcnab
and
most
of
the
men
in
the
bar
but
his
acknowledgment
of
dan
greeting
was
and
he
went
soon
after
farrel
came
in
the
schoolmaster
eyes
met
mcnab
but
mcnab
eyes
never
met
any
man
for
very
long
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
the
inner
man
a
stranger
might
get
glimpse
of
afraid
to
let
any
one
else
see
in
his
eyes
the
secrets
of
that
sly
spying
soul
of
his
now
that
farrel
had
only
one
eye
mcnab
feared
him
less
although
when
the
concentrated
light
of
the
schoolmaster
spirit
poured
from
it
in
a
single
beam
he
fidgeted
showed
craven
and
was
glad
to
escape
no
one
had
the
knack
that
dan
farrel
had
of
showing
mcnab
to
the
wirree
for
what
he
was
the
schoolmaster
could
string
mcnab
up
before
the
eyes
of
the
men
in
the
bar
on
the
thread
of
one
of
his
whimsical
humours
and
show
him
dangling
all
his
crooked
limbs
writhing
his
twisted
face
simmering
with
wrath
he
could
pin
mcnab
with
a
few
words
and
make
a
butt
of
him
where
he
stood
before
his
rows
of
black
and
muddied
bottles
he
would
have
him
quivering
with
wrath
impotent
against
that
bitter
blithe
wit
and
the
laughter
it
raised
he
laughed
too
mcnab
he
was
wise
as
cunning
as
a
dingo
though
his
eyes
were
baleful
and
his
hands
shook
as
he
poured
the
raw
spirits
from
his
bottle
into
a
mug
beside
him
he
laughed
it
a
mad
game
y
on
with
mcnab
salt
watson
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
wirreeford
men
said
to
the
schoolmaster
one
evening
on
his
way
home
give
it
up
dan
it
good
enough
to
make
the
boys
laugh
but
you
only
to
look
at
thad
face
when
he
smiles
to
know
what
he
is
promising
himself
of
it
all
the
schoolmaster
had
watched
mcnab
face
when
he
smiled
he
had
learnt
all
he
wanted
to
he
knew
what
salt
meant
for
awhile
he
dropped
out
of
the
circle
round
thad
bar
when
he
made
one
of
it
his
laughter
was
less
frequent
and
he
missed
mcnab
when
his
arrows
of
wit
whistled
in
the
assembly
his
spirits
had
suffered
a
depression
some
of
the
men
thought
the
trouble
with
his
eyes
was
on
his
mind
he
avoided
encounters
with
mcnab
though
none
of
them
had
any
idea
he
was
afraid
of
thad
his
one
eye
was
more
than
a
match
for
thad
two
any
day
they
knew
there
was
no
open
quarrel
between
them
the
schoolmaster
duelling
with
mcnab
had
never
been
more
than
a
laughing
matter
a
pricking
rapier
fashion
in
the
intervals
of
and
drinks
it
had
an
air
of
his
humour
had
a
quality
of
amiability
though
nobody
was
deceived
by
it
least
of
all
thad
himself
there
was
always
contempt
and
an
underlying
bitterness
in
it
chapter
xxii
what
the
matter
with
davey
farrel
asked
his
daughter
a
few
days
later
i
asked
him
to
come
up
here
and
have
tea
with
us
but
he
wo
come
he
barely
speak
to
me
when
we
meet
gets
out
of
my
way
if
he
sees
me
coming
deirdre
was
kneeling
by
the
hearth
waiting
for
the
kettle
to
boil
their
table
was
spread
with
cups
and
saucers
and
a
little
pile
of
toast
smoked
beside
the
teapot
she
said
nothing
only
bent
her
head
lower
to
avoid
his
glance
have
you
got
anything
to
do
with
it
he
asked
the
firelight
played
on
her
face
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
would
tell
him
of
the
meeting
under
the
trees
and
the
promises
she
and
davey
had
made
to
each
other
when
they
said
but
there
was
so
much
to
tell
and
he
would
be
hurt
that
she
had
not
told
him
about
it
long
ago
they
never
had
any
secrets
she
had
shared
all
her
thoughts
with
dan
at
first
that
she
and
davey
were
sweethearts
had
just
been
something
to
smile
about
and
gossip
over
with
herself
the
schoolmaster
had
wondered
while
they
were
away
why
she
was
always
restless
and
wanting
to
get
back
to
the
hills
and
now
there
was
shame
and
grief
in
her
heart
a
smarting
sense
of
anger
and
disappointment
that
had
come
of
seeing
davey
dancing
with
jess
and
of
hearing
what
people
were
saying
about
them
it
was
all
fixed
up
between
ross
jess
and
davey
cameron
someone
had
told
her
and
remarked
what
a
fine
couple
they
would
make
and
how
satisfied
their
parents
were
about
it
even
donald
cameron
who
was
not
an
easy
man
to
please
she
could
not
explain
all
that
dan
read
in
her
face
something
of
what
was
in
her
mind
he
took
her
hand
and
looked
into
her
face
it
was
quivering
and
downcast
then
you
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
deirdre
he
said
no
her
voice
broke
it
was
the
night
of
the
dance
at
mary
ann
the
night
we
came
i
remember
he
said
conal
was
there
and
davey
went
away
angry
i
tried
to
speak
to
him
a
dozen
times
since
she
cried
well
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
the
schoolmaster
said
after
a
few
moments
but
they
tell
me
in
the
town
that
since
his
father
been
ill
and
davey
had
charge
of
things
he
been
drinking
a
good
deal
and
playing
the
fool
at
mcnab
generally
we
got
to
try
and
get
him
out
of
that
if
it
only
for
his
mother
sake
deirdre
we
owe
her
a
bigger
debt
you
and
i
you
because
you
love
me
than
we
can
ever
repay
she
owes
you
something
too
the
girl
said
quickly
that
night
of
the
fires
if
you
had
tried
to
prevent
it
she
knew
that
he
was
displeased
you
must
say
that
again
he
said
oh
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
deirdre
cried
passionately
what
do
you
mean
the
schoolmaster
voice
was
very
quiet
deirdre
clung
to
him
sobbing
i
did
mean
that
i
hate
her
really
she
said
i
like
her
too
but
she
the
only
one
who
has
ever
come
between
you
and
me
dan
and
i
ca
bear
it
he
drew
her
to
his
knees
and
looked
down
gravely
into
her
face
her
body
was
stiff
against
his
it
shuddered
and
a
storm
of
tears
shook
her
tragic
dark
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
when
her
weeping
had
spent
itself
when
she
came
and
you
looked
at
her
my
heart
died
she
said
you
remember
when
we
used
to
gather
the
wild
flowers
to
put
on
the
table
at
school
you
used
to
say
we
could
never
find
a
flower
that
was
like
her
eyes
when
we
made
a
cameron
bouquet
we
used
to
put
in
it
white
and
the
pink
giraffe
orchids
that
grow
on
a
long
stem
for
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
for
her
mouth
and
for
her
hair
do
you
remember
at
first
we
could
find
anything
for
her
hair
but
then
i
found
the
climbing
with
the
little
pink
buds
on
the
end
of
them
the
down
on
the
leaves
all
browny
gold
and
glistening
in
the
sun
was
a
little
bit
like
her
hair
was
it
dan
yes
he
said
his
mind
going
back
to
all
their
gay
gatherings
of
wild
flowers
for
cameron
it
awed
and
surprised
him
that
she
should
even
then
have
discovered
what
his
most
secret
heart
was
scarcely
aware
of
it
was
the
little
blue
flowers
do
you
remember
we
put
in
for
her
eyes
deirdre
went
on
though
you
said
that
they
were
a
bit
like
her
eyes
on
the
grass
is
what
some
would
call
her
eyes
but
it
is
a
poor
colour
that
dew
on
the
grass
no
colour
at
all
you
said
with
the
dew
on
it
or
dew
with
a
scrap
of
heaven
or
the
twilight
shining
in
it
would
have
been
better
that
what
she
has
deirdre
you
used
to
say
with
the
twilight
in
them
twilight
eyes
you
can
see
her
thoughts
gathering
in
them
brooding
and
dark
or
glimmering
like
the
light
of
the
day
dying
do
you
remember
saying
all
that
to
me
i
do
because
i
said
it
over
to
myself
so
often
he
understood
the
apprehensive
shy
and
shamed
confession
of
her
eyes
do
you
mean
he
asked
that
deirdre
thinks
anybody
could
be
to
me
what
she
is
deirdre
nodded
her
contrite
gaze
melting
into
his
that
one
his
head
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
hills
is
like
the
mother
of
god
to
me
she
was
very
good
to
me
when
i
was
a
desperate
man
long
ago
deirdre
gazed
at
him
her
lips
quivering
that
why
you
must
always
love
her
cameron
my
darling
black
head
he
said
sing
it
to
me
deirdre
cried
thirsting
for
the
tenderness
of
the
old
song
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
crooned
in
the
gaelic
as
he
used
to
when
she
was
a
baby
put
your
black
head
darling
darling
darling
your
darling
black
head
my
heart
above
o
mouth
of
honey
with
thyme
for
fragrance
who
with
heart
in
breast
could
deny
you
love
deirdre
pressing
to
him
tasted
the
satisfaction
that
all
young
creatures
have
in
being
close
to
those
they
love
his
arms
were
warm
and
tender
an
invasion
of
peace
drove
the
sorrowful
ache
from
her
heart
my
own
mother
she
asked
suddenly
was
she
like
mrs
cameron
no
there
was
the
mingling
of
grief
and
troubled
thinking
in
his
face
that
she
had
always
seen
there
when
he
spoke
of
her
mother
she
had
a
little
brown
bird
an
english
bird
that
sang
in
a
cage
he
said
she
was
like
that
but
she
never
sang
herself
she
was
one
of
those
people
life
has
broken
deirdre
you
married
her
and
looked
after
her
dan
his
head
dropped
he
avoided
her
eyes
then
you
came
and
she
died
he
said
such
a
sorrowful
mite
you
were
he
went
on
such
a
lonely
baby
wailing
night
and
day
that
there
was
only
one
name
to
give
you
deirdre
deirdre
of
the
griefs
his
eyes
were
lifted
to
hers
the
black
shield
covered
one
of
them
the
other
was
shining
with
his
tenderness
for
her
the
strength
of
the
tide
behind
it
it
was
a
sorrowful
name
to
give
you
darling
you
that
have
been
the
sunshine
and
have
banished
the
sorrows
of
my
life
he
cried
may
they
never
come
any
more
or
grief
touch
us
again
chapter

strange
tales
were
being
told
of
cameron
son
in
wirreeford
donald
cameron
had
been
laid
up
crippled
with
rheumatism
since
the
early
spring
and
davey
had
been
managing
for
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
boy
found
himself
with
responsibility
authority
and
money
in
his
hands
the
old
man
required
a
strict
account
of
his
movements
and
operations
allowing
him
only
a
few
shillings
to
pay
for
his
meals
and
nothing
over
for
the
couple
of
drinks
that
cemented
a
deal
in
the
township
mcnab
had
got
hold
of
young
davey
how
it
was
not
exactly
known
let
the
old
man
sew
up
his
young
davey
open
them
for
him
loafers
began
to
say
davey
swaggered
he
was
cock
of
the
walk
at
mcnab
conal
had
gone
to
new
south
wales
again
and
now
there
was
not
a
man
spent
more
nor
was
as
free
with
the
dice
as
davey
the
schoolmaster
heard
mcnab
talking
to
davey
in
the
parlour
behind
the
bar
one
evening
filling
the
boy
with
a
flattery
that
went
to
his
head
faster
than
the
crude
spirits
he
plied
him
with
the
only
son
of
the
richest
man
in
these
parts
be
a
bit
of
a
millionaire
davey
when
y
too
old
to
enjoy
the
money
have
a
good
time
with
it
mcnab
said
your
father
a
great
man
a
great
man
davey
a
bit
near
that
all
do
understand
that
a
youngster
like
got
to
have
a
bit
of
gilt
about
him
makes
you
look
ridiculous
that
what
it
does
havin
no
more
money
about
you
than
a
teamster
or
a
bloomin
rouseabout
here
you
you
hold
your
tongue
about
the
old
man
mcnab
davey
struggled
to
say
you
you
give
me
the
money
it
be
all
right
when
i
come
into
the
property
i
want
to
have
a
game
with
the
boys
now
mcnab
sniggered
oh
well
you
a
lad
davey
he
said
as
good
a
man
with
cattle
as
your
father
and
you
know
better
than
he
does
how
to
make
yourself
popular
we
used
to
say
you
was
as
mean
as
him
once
a
chip
of
the
old
block
davey
started
to
his
feet
he
stood
by
the
table
swaying
a
little
as
he
hung
to
it
you
you
be
careful
mcnab
or
i
smash
your
damned
head
he
said
it
was
only
when
they
were
very
fuddled
that
men
spoke
to
him
like
this
mcnab
giggled
farrel
heard
the
boy
voice
it
came
to
him
thick
and
uncertain
through
the
thin
walls
the
door
of
mcnab
parlour
was
ajar
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
davey
sullen
flushed
face
his
eyes
stupid
and
dull
with
the
glow
of
drink
in
them
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
into
the
room
hullo
davey
he
said
i
was
looking
for
you
davey
stared
at
him
uncertainly
you
may
know
farrel
mcnab
said
an
evil
light
in
his
yellow
eyes
but
davey
here
is
doing
an
important
bit
of
business
with
me
and
you
intrudin
the
schoolmaster
glanced
at
him
intruding
am
i
he
replied
coolly
well
it
seems
to
me
it
just
about
time
what
do
you
mean
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
school
out
farrel
davey
crowed
lurching
back
on
his
heels
you
hurry
up
and
give
me
the
money
mcnab
mcnab
put
a
couple
of
sovereigns
into
his
hand
come
and
have
a
drink
farrel
davey
cried
boisterously
a
couple
of
chaps
in
the
bar
waiting
for
me
and
i
play
you
poker
bob
rises
not
a
dime
more
he
staggered
across
the
room
and
threw
open
the
door
into
the
mcnab
followed
him
turning
back
at
the
doorway
to
shoot
a
glance
of
triumph
at
the
schoolmaster
davey
appearance
in
the
bar
was
hailed
with
a
shout
dan
heard
the
rattling
of
bottles
and
glasses
the
shouts
of
laughter
blaring
of
oaths
and
stamping
of
heavy
feet
that
followed
the
boy
call
for
drinks
all
round
fragments
of
a
song
bawled
jocosely
came
to
the
schoolmaster
ears
as
he
tramped
down
the
road
to
the
cottage
on
the
edge
of
the
township
he
brooded
over
the
change
in
davey
asking
himself
how
he
came
to
be
kicking
over
the
traces
why
he
was
going
to
the
dogs
with
the
of
mcnab
what
donald
cameron
would
say
to
it
if
he
knew
how
he
could
fail
to
know
what
his
mother
was
feeling
and
thinking
about
it
she
would
know
of
that
he
was
certain
not
much
escaped
those
clear
still
eyes
of
hers
in
the
morning
when
he
saw
the
boy
again
he
tried
to
speak
to
him
but
davey
swung
past
dragging
his
hat
over
his
face
shamefacedly
the
schoolmaster
got
into
the
habit
of
watching
him
trying
to
see
his
face
sometimes
it
surprised
him
he
had
seen
davey
thrashing
a
steer
until
the
blood
poured
from
its
tawny
hide
he
had
seen
him
swinging
along
the
roads
on
sale
days
after
the
midday
meal
reckless
and
laughing
his
head
thrown
back
a
couple
of
mcnab
men
at
his
heels
he
had
heard
him
singing
drunkenly
on
his
way
home
to
the
hills
in
the
evenings
he
went
after
him
one
evening
when
johnson
cameron
head
stockman
had
gone
on
early
and
davey
was
going
home
alone
look
here
davey
he
said
riding
beside
him
what
this
game
on
you
have
to
drop
it
davey
laughed
you
like
the
rest
of
them
he
said
bitterly
think
a
fellow
never
grows
up
i
been
treated
like
a
kid
too
long
the
old
man
been
making
me
the
laughing
stock
of
the
country
and
he
got
to
understand
i
a
man
and
i
got
to
be
treated
like
one
you
need
go
drinking
and
chucking
money
about
at
mcnab
to
be
that
davey
eyes
veered
on
him
conal
does
it
he
said
and
you
all
think
no
end
of
him
oh
conal
what
has
he
got
to
do
with
it
the
schoolmaster
hesitated
conal
does
it
but
then
he
a
roadster
it
comes
natural
to
him
it
does
to
you
you
cameron
son
and
cameron
son
davey
scoffed
much
good
that
does
me
what
your
father
going
to
say
when
he
hears
about
this
business
at
the
black
bull
the
schoolmaster
asked
say
oh
he
cut
up
at
first
he
got
to
understand
though
i
got
to
go
my
own
way
have
some
money
to
call
my
own
he
wo
know
more
than
good
for
him
though
that
arranged
between
mcnab
and
me
you
do
mean
to
say
you
got
into
any
arrangement
with
mcnab
the
schoolmaster
asked
oh
you
need
look
like
that
about
it
davey
replied
it
a
harmless
one
he
been
decent
i
not
fool
enough
to
give
mcnab
any
real
handle
against
me
you
a
darned
fool
davey
the
schoolmaster
said
his
voice
ripping
the
silence
with
startled
energy
mcnab
and
his
crew
have
you
in
a
hole
before
you
know
where
you
are
davey
flicked
the
reins
across
his
mare
neck
she
leapt
forward
along
the
track
there
was
not
a
man
in
wirreeford
who
did
not
think
he
knew
what
thad
was
driving
at
that
he
was
working
for
a
shot
at
donald
cameron
through
young
davey
only
he
did
not
see
it
the
calf
they
said
they
laughed
and
followed
the
course
of
thad
snaring
with
winks
chuckles
of
amusement
and
sly
jokes
at
young
davey
expense
although
they
drank
with
him
flattered
and
applauded
him
playing
up
to
the
part
mcnab
had
set
them
the
schoolmaster
tried
again
to
warn
the
boy
this
time
davey
was
inclined
to
listen
to
him
what
can
mcnab
do
to
me
he
asked
i
not
a
lag
or
a
lag
son
no
the
schoolmaster
said
a
little
bitterly
but
i
been
watching
mcnab
seeing
the
way
he
works
he
got
a
genius
for
the
underhand
job
there
not
much
he
could
do
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it
he
set
his
mind
to
something
now
i
can
see
that
and
you
in
the
way
of
it
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
is
you
know
he
does
love
your
father
perhaps
it
that
he
never
forgiven
him
for
trying
to
get
him
cleared
out
he
using
you
somehow
davey
i
believe
you
right
farrel
davey
said
slowly
after
a
while
i
been
a
fool
he
swore
uneasily
think
i
been
mad
lately
i
wanted
people
to
reckon
i
was
just
cameron
son
and
as
they
make
i
two
parts
wrong
and
one
part
right
the
right
part
is
i
got
to
be
independent
i
got
to
have
money
of
my
own
it
was
what
you
said
the
other
night
set
me
thinking
i
going
to
keep
out
of
mcnab
way
mcnab
never
shows
his
hand
when
he
means
to
win
davey
there
was
a
whimsical
inflection
in
the
schoolmaster
voice
you
can
only
beat
him
at
his
own
game
if
you
do
let
him
see
your
cards
either
eh
the
boy
looked
at
him
you
mean
do
drop
him
at
once
let
him
down
slowly
yes
he
got
his
knife
into
me
too
you
know
though
he
has
shown
it
quite
clearly
yet
he
good
at
the
waiting
game
it
be
a
bit
interesting
to
see
how
he
marks
us
both
off
if
we
do
mark
him
off
that
is
i
going
to
get
out
of
his
way

soon
as

were

chapter
xxiv
cameron
was
not
seen
in
wirreeford
during
those
months
of
her
husband
illness
cameron
drove
into
the
township
unexpectedly
one
day
when
the
sales
were
in
progress
and
she
was
with
him
he
went
to
the
yards
and
she
turned
the
horse
a
sturdy
daughter
of
old
lassie
back
along
the
road
and
halted
her
outside
the
schoolmaster
cottage
deirdre
went
out
to
meet
her
i
only
heard
you
were
back
a
few
days
ago
deirdre
cameron
said
did
davey
tell
you
deirdre
asked
no
his
mother
replied
they
went
indoors
and
cameron
sat
with
her
back
to
the
window
in
the
schoolmaster
wicker
chair
deirdre
noticed
that
she
looked
older
and
wearier
than
when
she
had
last
seen
her
they
tell
me
you
to
marry
conal
the
drover
dear
cameron
said
it
not
true
deirdre
gasped
turning
away
from
her
who
told
you
ross
it
was
cameron
replied
she
was
over
the
other
day
she
and
jess
she
said
the
boys
had
heard
at
the
sales
they
tell
me
deirdre
eyes
met
cameron
and
her
voice
ran
as
quietly
as
hers
that
davey
to
marry
jess
ross
oh
cameron
exclaimed
distressfully
i
do
know
they
say
so
but
davey
her
face
worked
pitifully
he
so
strange
i
do
understand
him
at
all
deirdre
he
so
changed
i
ca
help
him
ca
do
anything
for
him
he
seems
to
have
become
a
man
quite
suddenly
and
she
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
began
to
cry
deirdre
bent
over
her
do
do
cry
cameron
dear
she
whispered
kissing
her
it
so
foolish
mary
cameron
said
tremulously
as
if
asking
forbearance
but
my
heart
just
breaking
to
see
davey
like
he
is
i
have
managed
to
keep
his
father
from
knowing
so
far
but
i
afraid
i
dare
think
what
will
happen
when
he
knows
deirdre
said
nothing
but
her
eyes
were
full
cameron
stretched
a
hand
out
to
her
oh
dear
she
said
they
say
it
is
jess
davey
going
to
marry
but
i
ca
think
it
anybody
but
you
he
cares
about
when
first
you
went
away
we
used
to
talk
about
you
davey
used
to
say
a
pelling
i
do
believe
mother
because
of
the
i
used
to
tell
him
he
made
me
tell
it
over
and
over
again
after
you
gone
away
it
was
about
penelop
the
tylwyth
teg
who
married
the
farmer
boy
do
you
remember
deirdre
i
sure
i
told
it
to
you
too
in
the
old
days
yes
deirdre
cried
breathlessly
and
ever
afterwards
their
descendants
were
called
pellings
the
children
of
penelop
and
it
was
said
if
they
had
dark
hair
and
bright
eyes
there
was
fairy
blood
in
their
veins
cameron
smiled
yes
she
said
fancy
you
remembering
it
after
all
this
long
time
dear
once
soon
after
you
gone
away
davey
said
to
me
wonder
if
deirdre
married
me
mother
would
she
melt
away
if
i
touched
her
with
a
piece
of
iron
he
sat
thinking
and
smiling
a
long
time
deirdre
and
i
felt
so
happy
about
you
both
then
you
came
back
and
it
was
all
different
i
been
thinking
perhaps
it
was
conal
has
come
between
you
the
eyes
of
davey
mother
were
very
wistful
but
if
you
not
going
to
marry
conal
perhaps
you
can
be
good
friends
with
davey
again
deirdre
he
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
once
the
other
night
when
he
came
home
he
had
been
at
mcnab
until
late
and
the
drink
was
strong
on
him
i
could
let
him
into
the
house
for
fear
of
his
father
waking
he
slept
in
the
barn
and
i
sat
near
him
i
was
afraid
he
might
light
a
match
and
drop
it
in
the
hay
and
he
talked
in
his
sleep
sobbing
and
crying
and
it
was
your
name
he
was
saying
over
and
over
again
to
himself
as
though
his
heart
was
breaking
over
it
deirdre
and
there
some
affair
with
mcnab
troubling
him
cameron
went
on
i
do
know
what
it
is
oh
i
do
know
what
he
been
doing
to
get
mixed
up
with
mcnab
in
anything
i
know
he
can
mean
davey
no
good
whatever
he
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
on
his
father
for
long
enough
they
say
you
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
country
deirdre
if
only
you
help
me
to
keep
davey
away
from
mcnab
you
could
he
do
anything
for
you
in
the
old
days
what
is
it
has
come
between
you
cameron
eyes
were
very
like
davey
had
been
when
he
kissed
her
under
the
trees
deirdre
thought
she
put
her
hand
in
cameron
a
shadow
darkened
the
window
breaking
the
blank
of
the
sunlight
beyond
it
the
schoolmaster
came
in
at
the
door
that
overlooked
the
road
an
exclamation
drew
his
gaze
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
cameron
held
out
her
hand
to
him
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
night
of
the
fires
deirdre
went
to
her
little
of
a
kitchen
and
busied
herself
making
tea
when
she
returned
cameron
was
sitting
as
she
had
left
her
on
the
wicker
chair
with
her
back
to
the
light
but
there
was
an
added
pain
in
her
eyes
her
hands
lay
limp
in
her
lap
deirdre
had
a
tray
with
tea
and
the
cups
on
it
she
set
it
down
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
they
gathered
their
chairs
about
it
what
a
nice
home
you
got
cameron
said
smiling
at
the
schoolmaster
deirdre
has
turned
out
a
wonderful
housekeeper
after
all
the
schoolmaster
laughed
she
was
always
more
eager
to
be
and
chasing
calves
with
davey
than
to
be
learning
to
cook
and
sew
was
she
he
said
but
after
a
while
she
made
butter
as
well
as
i
could
cameron
smiled
and
as
for
spinning
deirdre
could
take
my
old
wheel
and
twist
up
a
yarn
for
me
in
no
time
will
you
let
her
come
soon
to
stay
with
me
for
a
while
yes
the
schoolmaster
eyes
dwelt
on
the
girl
for
a
moment
there
are
not
enough
children
coming
for
schooling
we
wo
be
here
for
much
longer
he
said
we
be
going
up
to
steve
soon
going
up
to
steve
deirdre
asked
when
the
schoolmaster
did
not
answer
at
once
when
conal
gets
back
i
want
to
see
him
first
he
said
we
just
be
staying
a
few
weeks
with
steve
for
a
holiday
and
then
be
leaving
the
district
again
cameron
sat
talking
to
them
of
the
affairs
of
her
life
a
little
longer
then
she
got
up
to
go
is
it
true
what
they
say
that
he
will
lose
his
sight
she
asked
deirdre
when
they
were
outside
deirdre
nodded
she
could
scarcely
speak
of
the
time
when
the
light
of
the
world
would
be
blotted
out
for
ever
from
dan
we
saw
a
doctor
in
rane
he
said
so
she
replied
cameron
exclamation
was
in
the
soft
tongue
of
the
spinning
song
she
sang
when
she
sat
with
her
wheel
in
the
garden
deirdre
did
not
know
the
words
but
she
understood
their
distress
and
the
little
gesture
that
went
with
them
chapter
xxv
donald
cameron
was
made
of
the
stuff
that
gives
confidence
and
appreciation
grudgingly
he
was
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
no
one
could
do
anything
as
well
as
he
could
he
could
only
satisfy
his
own
reckless
desire
to
be
up
and
doing
by
girding
at
all
that
was
being
done
for
him
if
davey
had
been
less
efficient
a
it
would
have
pleased
him
better
he
would
have
liked
to
see
mistakes
made
which
would
assure
him
that
no
one
but
himself
could
run
ayrmuir
as
it
ought
to
be
run
but
davey
had
done
very
well
in
his
place
he
had
brought
off
one
bargain
with
a
smartness
that
his
father
vaguely
resented
and
davey
was
chockful
of
boyish
pride
over
there
had
been
chafings
and
crossings
of
will
two
or
three
times
mary
cameron
trembled
when
she
heard
them
anxious
fears
fluttered
and
filled
her
with
foreboding
every
time
her
husband
irritability
at
his
chained
helplessness
and
crippling
pain
was
directed
at
davey
the
boy
short
answers
with
an
underlying
contempt
in
them
fanned
his
smouldering
wrath
davey
dear
she
had
said
once
after
there
had
been
high
words
between
them
try
and
be
a
little
more
patient
with
your
father
hard
on
him
having
to
sit
in
a
chair
like
this
after
the
active
life
he
led
he
fretting
his
heart
out
to
be
up
and
doing
things
and
seeing
them
done
the
way
he
likes
there
no
pleasing
him
mother
davey
said
shaking
her
arms
from
him
she
knew
he
was
right
but
davey
was
almost
as
sullen
and
surly
as
his
father
these
days
donald
cameron
kept
him
going
all
day
the
boy
was
when
he
came
into
the
house
at
nightfall
then
there
were
entries
to
make
and
to
do
accounts
of
sales
and
movements
of
stock
to
render
and
nothing
but
carping
and
for
his
pains
at
one
time
in
the
evenings
he
used
to
take
out
his
books
and
read
intently
for
hours
sprawling
over
the
table
till
the
candle
flickered
down
and
his
mother
said
softly
wo
you
go
to
bed
now
dear
knowing
that
late
hours
were
never
an
excuse
in
donald
cameron
eyes
for
failing
to
be
out
after
the
cows
before
the
sun
was
up
but
now
he
lay
in
his
chair
his
long
legs
stretched
out
before
him
after
he
had
given
his
father
an
account
of
the
day
work
and
got
from
him
directions
for
the
next
and
there
was
a
sullen
brooding
look
on
his
face
an
expression
in
his
eyes
that
it
hurt
her
to
see
davey
face
had
changed
so
within
the
last
few
months
it
was
a
revelation
to
her
there
was
a
firmness
of
line
about
his
chin
and
upper
lip
that
caused
her
to
glance
from
him
to
his
father
little
of
the
boy
was
left
in
davey
now
she
realised
what
there
was
lay
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
mouth
it
was
as
if
the
child
in
him
were
dying
hard
something
had
hurt
him
bitterly
she
surmised
and
she
wondered
whether
it
was
bitter
thinking
hard
riding
or
the
life
he
was
leading
with
strange
rough
men
that
had
brought
those
creases
about
his
nose
given
his
face
its
dour
manliness
this
was
a
strange
to
her
her
heart
yearned
over
him
as
though
her
baby
had
been
snatched
from
her
arms
she
wanted
to
know
him
to
understand
his
ways
of
thinking
but
he
had
a
new
and
strange
manner
with
her
his
mind
was
shut
he
kissed
her
in
a
perfunctory
fashion
and
when
she
put
her
arms
round
him
he
stiffened
under
them
in
sympathetic
sensitive
fashion
she
knew
that
he
was
guarding
the
kingdom
of
himself
against
her
she
had
some
subtle
warning
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
love
of
her
tenderness
which
with
its
fine
edge
might
prize
open
the
inner
shell
of
his
being
and
discover
the
trouble
and
tremulous
fury
of
emotion
which
lay
hidden
within
she
was
afraid
of
offending
him
afraid
of
approaching
him
with
her
affection
and
sympathy
afraid
not
to
respect
the
reserve
that
he
had
put
between
them
yet
her
anxiety
tormenting
her
one
day
she
said
tell
me
what
is
troubling
you
davey
tell
me
it
is
breaking
my
heart
to
see
you
like
this
there
nothing
to
tell
mother
he
replied
sharply
for
a
long
time
he
had
not
been
coming
home
till
late
the
silence
of
the
long
evenings
when
she
sat
and
sewed
by
the
fire
and
donald
cameron
glowered
into
it
smoking
had
been
unbroken
sometimes
he
had
asked
where
davey
was
then
she
stilled
the
tremors
in
her
voice
to
say
quietly
that
she
thought
he
was
with
the
rosses
or
at
hegarty
for
the
dancing
chapter
xxvi
when
davey
came
in
from
the
wirree
the
night
after
cameron
had
been
to
see
deirdre
and
the
schoolmaster
donald
cameron
was
standing
before
the
fire
he
had
said
nothing
all
the
way
of
the
long
drive
from
wirreeford
but
his
wife
by
the
set
of
his
face
knew
that
something
unusual
had
happened
he
stood
before
the
fireplace
waiting
for
davey
to
come
home
listening
for
the
sound
of
his
horse
feet
the
yelping
of
the
dogs
in
the
yard
that
would
announce
his
arrival
before
they
had
left
the
as
he
was
sitting
in
the
high
buggy
before
they
drove
off
he
had
sent
her
back
to
look
for
davey
and
tell
him
to
come
home
as
soon
as
the
sales
were
over
davey
a
lean
lithe
figure
on
the
edge
of
a
group
of
stockmen
had
recognised
the
urgency
in
her
voice
the
appeal
of
her
eyes
as
she
gave
him
the
message
we
were
just
to
have
a
game
of
poker
cameron
mick
ross
had
said
she
sought
davey
eyes
the
shadow
of
his
hat
was
over
them
he
stood
a
moment
flicking
his
leggings
with
the
lash
of
the
long
whip
curled
on
his
arm
right
mother
i
come
along
presently
he
said
she
went
back
to
her
husband
her
heart
soothed
but
his
face
all
the
way
home
had
filled
her
with
fear
has
anything
happened
to
upset
you
donald
she
asked
aye
matter
enough
he
replied
what
is
it
she
ventured
you
hear
soon
he
lapsed
into
silence
again
she
knew
that
there
was
trouble
ahead
for
davey
what
it
was
she
could
only
imagine
every
fibre
of
her
being
ached
to
know
she
hurried
jenny
on
with
the
dinner
so
that
his
father
inner
man
would
be
warmed
and
comforted
before
davey
arrived
he
was
an
hour
or
two
later
than
they
were
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
she
went
up
to
him
and
put
her
arms
round
him
whatever
you
do
do
cross
your
father
davey
dear
she
said
in
a
queer
temper
davey
looked
at
her
stupidly
he
threw
off
his
hat
and
brushed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
right
mother
he
said
slowly
his
voice
was
thick
she
smelt
the
whisky
on
his
breath
as
he
turned
into
the
next
room
hurrying
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
fire
to
the
table
lifting
the
dinner
she
had
kept
warm
for
him
by
the
fire
she
did
not
hear
the
first
words
of
the
storm
that
was
brewing
in
the
inner
room
lifting
the
tray
she
carried
it
in
but
on
the
threshold
she
stood
still
her
heart
cold
at
the
sight
of
her
husband
and
son
they
were
facing
each
other
all
the
antagonism
that
had
been
latent
for
months
between
them
ablaze
in
their
eyes
betrayed
by
every
line
of
their
faces
she
put
her
tray
on
the
table
donald
cameron
had
a
packet
of
papers
in
his
hand
the
torn
envelope
he
had
taken
them
from
lay
on
the
floor
look
at
them
look
at
them
he
shouted
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
the
meaning
of
them
david
took
the
papers
he
pushed
back
a
chair
staring
at
them
curse
mcnab
he
muttered
he
promised
me
curb
your
tongue
in
this
house
donald
cameron
took
a
step
forward
have
you
anything
to
say
to
these
bills
mcnab
says
you
had
credit
for
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
davey
head
cleared
the
sight
of
his
father
face
livid
with
rage
raised
a
demon
in
him
yes
he
said
there
a
couple
of
drinks
i
had
not
charged
for
you
insolent
young
blackguard
donald
cameron
cried
careless
of
words
in
his
anger
is
this
the
sort
of
son
i
got
goes
robbing
me
behind
my
back
drinking
with
pothouse
boys
lags
and
thieves
i
thought
you
could
be
trusted
to
take
charge
of
my
interests
while
i
was
stop
that
davey
nostrils
quivered
ominously
thought
you
could
play
the
young
lord
and
mcnab
comes
telling
me
i
wring
mcnab
neck
aye
you
will
said
the
old
man
bitterly
you
let
him
wring
you
properly
mcnab
got
no
reason
to
love
me
and
you
know
it
but
he
did
the
square
thing
this
time
if
he
never
did
it
in
his
life
before
telling
me
i
was
being
robbed
by
my
own
son
i
advise
you
father
not
to
talk
that
way
davey
temper
was
rising
i
wanted
money
you
would
have
given
it
to
me
if
i
asked
for
it
i
had
to
get
it
mcnab
lent
it
to
me
he
said
i
could
pay
him
by
and
by
and
that
it
was
good
enough
being
cameron
son
to
borrow
money
on
he
said
you
never
see
these
receipts
i
gave
him
well
you
borrow
no
more
donald
cameron
breathed
johnson
can
take
charge
of
things
till
i
about
again
and
before
you
make
an
arrangement
of
this
kind
again
you
perhaps
wait
till
i
dead
and
buried
i
have
it
posted
in
the
wirree
that
no
one
is
to
serve
you
with
drink
unless
you
pay
for
it
if
you
do
that
davey
began
what
i
regret
is
that
i
did
give
johnson
charge
of
things
from
the
first
the
old
man
continued
but
i
set
my
own
son
before
him
shown
y
were
fit
for
the
trust
snaring
me
on
a
level
with
gaol
birds
davey
voice
trembled
with
passion
i
have
snared
you
he
cried
i
have
taken
what
was
my
own
is
what
yours
mine
have
you
always
said
so
is
that
what
you
said
when
i
asked
for
wages
and
you
said
have
you
said
that
it
will
be
all
mine
some
day
this
place
and
all
the
money
you
made
who
else
have
you
got
to
give
it
to
i
only
been
doing
with
the
money
what
you
ought
to
have
done
i
spent
some
of
it
so
as
not
to
have
us
shamed
in
the
country
oh
that
it
is
it
donald
cameron
grey
eyes
gleamed
beneath
their
shaggy
brows
the
son
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
the
fortune
the
father
earns
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
well
i
tell
you
this
much
davey
you
not
get
a
penny
of
my
money
to
throw
to
the
winds
if
you
were
a
good
son
a
hardworking
industrious
lad
y
might
be
sure
of
it
but
if
you
were
fifty
times
flesh
of
my
flesh
you
not
get
a
penny
to
go
to
the
devil
with
donald
donald
mary
cameron
laid
a
hand
on
her
husband
coat
speak
to
the
boy
like
that
she
cried
you
know
he
a
good
lad
that
he
worked
hard
for
years
he
pushed
her
away
be
silent
he
said
harshly
you
held
y
tongue
though
you
must
have
known
what
been
going
on
that
he
got
into
these
brawling
roistering
ways
mcnab
told
me
about
them
said
that
i
be
blaming
him
when
i
found
out
if
he
did
tell
me
himself
you
screened
and
hidden
the
boy
leave
mother
out
of
it
davey
said
davey
she
besought
him
it
all
right
mother
he
turned
from
her
impatiently
we
got
to
have
this
out
now
and
be
done
with
it
i
not
going
on
as
i
have
done
this
is
what
i
got
to
say
he
eyed
donald
cameron
squarely
since
i
left
school
four
years
ago
i
worked
on
this
place
worked
harder
than
two
men
and
what
have
i
got
for
it
wages
no
abuse
stacks
of
it
and
you
making
money
hand
over
fist
the
contempt
in
his
eyes
deepened
i
know
what
your
bank
says
i
know
what
the
countryside
says
about
donald
cameron
money
you
the
richest
man
this
side
of
the
ranges
but
how
do
we
live
you
go
about
in
old
clothes
as
if
you
had
a
penny
to
bless
yourself
with
and
i
might
be
anybody
rouseabout
for
the
look
of
me
never
a
penny
leaks
out
of
your
pockets
if
you
can
help
it
there
none
in
them
to
leak
out
of
mine
do
you
know
what
people
are
saying
about
us
have
you
heard
anybody
say
go
cameron
and
his
son
old
cameron
is
as
mean
as
they
make
and
young
a
chip
of
the
old
block
it
was
hearing
that
got
me
down
what
the
good
of
your
money
to
you
what
the
good
of
it
to
mother
what
the
good
of
it
to
me
because
you
worked
hard
for
it
in
the
beginning
is
that
any
reason
why
you
should
hang
on
to
it
when
you
got
it
be
afraid
to
spend
it
i
might
just
as
well
be
dead
as
working
always
with
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
think
of
but
work
always
under
your
thumb
screwed
down
not
allowed
to
have
a
mind
of
my
own
i
rather
get
a
job
on
the
roads
and
be
free
and
have
a
few

me
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
men
davey
asked
his
eyes
bright
with
anger
no
cameron
hesitated
something
of
the
justice
of
the
boy
point
of
view
reached
him
but
there
was
more
involved
than
a
mere
recognition
of
justice
it
meant
the
breaking
of
a
will
and
it
was
foreign
to
his
mind
to
yield
his
obstinacy
was
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
you
my
son
not
a
hired
labourer
on
the
place
he
said
i
fed
and
clothed
you
all
your
days
you
have
food
and
clothes
and
what
else
i
like
to
give
you
and
how
much
will
that
be
davey
eyed
him
narrowly
it
wo
wear
a
hole
in
trousers
pockets
donald
cameron
permitted
himself
the
grim
humour
believing
that
he
had
won
the
day
and
it
wo
encourage
you
to
be
dicing
and
drinking
at
mcnab
his
mother
more
sensitive
to
davey
state
of
mind
broke
in
oh
she
cried
have
no
more
of
this
talking
now
i
sit
down
and
eat
your
supper
davey
it
all
be
cold
stick
to
your
money
davey
yelled
i
wo
be
fed
and
clothed
by
you
any
longer
i
earn
my
own
living
somewhere
else
he
strode
out
of
the
room
his
mother
heard
him
go
across
the
flagged
floor
of
the
kitchen
go
out
after
him
donald
call
him
back
she
urged
no
said
cameron
slowly
davey
defiance
was
a
shock
to
him
he
had
ruled
his
little
world
autocratically
his
will
had
been
law
he
had
not
believed
that
davey
would
dare
to
resist
it
if
he
goes
of
his
own
will
let
him
come
back
of
it
he
said
oh
go
after
him
donald
she
cried
you
driven
him
to
it
you
with
your
harshness
she
ran
to
the
door
but
already
the
beat
of
hoofs
was
flying
up
from
the
misty
depths
of
the
trees
davey
davey
davey
she
called
she
ran
down
the
track
calling
him
but
davey
was
beyond
her
voice
or
the
sound
of
his
horse
hoofs
and
the
hot
blood
in
his
ears
dulled
the
echo
of
his
name
that
floated
down
to
him
when
mary
went
indoors
again
donald
cameron
was
sitting
in
his
chair
the
fire
had
gone
out
of
his
eyes
leaving
him
dull
and
vacant
you
been
harsh
with
him
donald
she
said
it
all
true
what
he
says
you
have
worked
him
like
a
navvy
and
never
given
him
enough
pocket
money
to
keep
him
in
tobacco
even
it
hard
on
him
when
the
morrison
boys
and
the
rosses
have
their
own
money
to
spend
and
everybody
saying
we
better
off
than
any
of
the
people
about
you
would
have
stood
so
much
yourself
at
his
age
whist
woman
he
said
pettishly
his
head
bent
as
if
he
were
trying
to
catch
the
sound
of
distant
of
course
you
take
sides
with
him
oh
donald
is
it
yourself
in
him
that
making
him
like
this
she
cried
is
it
your
own
blood
speaking
in
all
his
ways
what
did
you
think
your
son
would
be
to
take
the
sort
of
treatment
you
given
him
from
any
man
even
his
own
father
you
should
have
stayed
on
the
farm
in
the
old
country
if
you
wanted
that
sort
of
man
for
a
son
if
you
had
wanted
davey
to
have
a
high
spirit
you
should
never
have
come
over
the
sea
here
you
should
have
had
me
to
come
with
you
for
his
mother
donald
cameron
dropped
into
his
chair
his
face
was
grey
and
lined
as
if
the
light
behind
it
were
extinguished
be
quiet
will
you
not
woman
he
said
i
will
not
there
was
a
spark
in
her
eyes
i
got
to
say
what
thinking
now
donald
cameron
i
held
my
tongue
long
enough
had
your
way
and
i
hardly
dared
to
breathe
when
you
spoke
for
years
your
always
laying
your
will
on
people
crushes
the
spirit
in
them
the
dominating
way
you
have
wants
to
lay
down
everything
before
it
but
i
glad
you
not
crushed
davey
though
it
breaking
my
heart
to
think
of
his
going
away
from
us
i
rather
have
it
than
see
him
grow
into
the
creeping
crawling
thing
nat
johnson
is
davey
got
in
him
what
brought
you
and
me
here
i
glad
he
got
that
spirit
there
no
fear
in
it
it
goes
straight
forward
you
grown
old
and
i
grown
old
she
continued
breathlessly
we
lost
all
our
fire
but
he
got
it
it
going
on
in
him
and
you
with
your
old
ideas
you
do
like
it
but
he
got
to
be
free
he
got
to
go
his
own
way
he
got
to
break
his
own
earth
donald
donald
cameron
moved
restively
it
from
his
mother
he
taken
his
liking
for
clacking
words
then
he
said
she
fell
back
from
him
with
a
little
desperate
gesture
that
she
had
made
so
little
headway
against
the
of
his
mind
will
you
not
go
after
him
to
wirreeford
and
get
him
to
come
home
again
she
asked
pitifully
he
is
a
clever
lad
he
be
a
credit
and
joy
to
us
yet
if
you
only
give
him
his
head
for
a
bit
donald
this
at
mcnab
does
mean
anything
it
only
to
put
you
right
with
the
people
here
really
and
because
he
troubled
in
his
mind
about
something
else
what
do
you
mean
his
eyebrows
twitched
his
sharp
eyes
settled
on
her
there
a
girl
on
his
mind
she
replied
hesitatingly
jess
ross
he
asked
i
fixed
in
my
mind
for
him
to
marry
her
well
there
was
the
glimmer
of
a
smile
in
her
eyes
it
not
jessie
that
davey
got
fixed
in
his
mind
to
marry
so
perhaps
it
just
as
well
you
should
be
away
from
each
other
for
a
while
one
of
the
wirree
girls
lag
daughters
every
one
of
them
his
fingers
drummed
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
a
shade
of
sadness
had
fallen
on
mrs
cameron
face
well
you
you
wo
get
davey
to
come
home
or
let
me
try
she
asked
her
heart
fainting
at
her
own
words
no
he
repeated
the
word
slowly
as
if
in
fear
that
his
tongue
would
give
effect
to
other
stirrings
of
his
brain
of
his
own
will
he
went
of
his
own
will
he
come
back
again
would
you
have
in
like
circumstances
she
asked
he
did
not
reply
he
our
only
one
donald
she
pleaded
he
my
son
but
what
the
meaning
of
these
he
said
shuffling
the
handful
of
mcnab
papers
davey
had
thrown
down
did
i
ever
make
bills
like
this
for
myself
have
i
worked
and
slaved
year
in
and
year
out
did
i
ever
throw
away
roistering
what
he
has
mary
looked
at
the
bills
she
had
not
seen
them
before
oh
she
said
slowly
that
the
bad
blood
of
me
in
him
my
people
were
all
a
spendthrift
lot
and
i
never
been
able
to
keep
anything
at
all
myself
whether
it
was
love
or
money
or
a
shawl
or
even
a
spirit
of
my
own
to
go
through
my
life
with
she
picked
up
the
tray
with
davey
untouched
meal
on
it
and
went
out
of
the
room
chapter
xxvii
a
was
tearing
across
the
plains
threatening
to
sweep
the
whole
wirree
township
off
its
foundations
and
dash
the
fragments
of
the
mud
houses
against
the
hills
it
broke
round
the
black
bull
with
the
noise
of
great
guns
and
in
the
pauses
of
its
blowing
the
booming
of
the
sea
on
the
beaches
five
miles
away
could
be
heard
when
davey
burst
open
the
door
he
brought
a
gust
of
wind
into
the
that
set
the
lights
sputtering
and
flaring
two
of
them
went
out
the
glasses
on
mcnab
bench
danced
as
he
hammered
it
with
his
fists
for
two
pins
i
thrash
you
he
yelled
you
got
me
into
borrowing
money
from
you
i
was
a
blamed
young
fool
but
what
your
game
what
do
you
mean
playing
fair
to
me
and
then
giving
me
away
to
the
old
man
a
neat
way
of
bleeding
him
that
what
it
was
getting
me
in
here
drunk
and
then
the
schoolmaster
was
playing
cards
with
a
couple
of
men
on
an
upturned
box
behind
the
door
he
threw
down
his
cards
and
took
davey
arm
the
boy
threw
it
off
leave
me
alone
farrel
he
cried
i
sweep
the
floor
with
the
the
damned
swine
if
he
were
worth
sweeping
the
floor
with
all
afraid
of
him
well
i
not
you
see
here
mister
mcnab
he
leant
across
the
bar
and
his
eyes
burnt
their
way
into
the
pale
shifty
eyes
of
thad
mcnab
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
if
you
ever
interfere
between
me
and
mine
again
hear
that
i
do
know
what
you
got
up
your
sleeve
and
i
do
care
you
just
keep
it
there
see
or
be
the
worse
for
you
mcnab
had
blenched
at
the
boy
headlong
passion
the
quivering
long
arms
seemed
scarcely
able
to
keep
themselves
off
his
miserable
shoulders
his
skin
was
the
gingery
colour
of
his
hair
and
though
he
grinned
feebly
looking
everywhere
but
at
davey
there
was
not
a
man
who
did
not
see
he
was
trembling
thad
mcnab
was
a
coward
everybody
knew
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
he
feared
more
than
the
vengeance
which
might
wreak
itself
on
his
miserable
body
as
young
davey
stamped
out
of
the
bar
there
was
a
rustle
of
movement
smothered
oaths
of
surprise
and
amusement
a
swinging
of
eyes
after
him
with
something
of
admiration
and
applause
in
them
but
mcnab
was
recovering
himself
he
gazed
speechlessly
after
the
boy
too
there
was
a
ghost
of
a
smile
on
his
face
his
mind
was
working
his
lips
moved
though
no
words
came
the
men
who
had
wanted
to
cheer
young
davey
shifted
their
opinions
uneasily
there
would
be
more
to
score
to
mcnab
account
yet
they
imagined
the
schoolmaster
did
not
follow
davey
out
of
the
bar
as
he
felt
inclined
to
but
when
the
boy
had
gone
mcnab
looked
across
at
him
that
what
comes
of
interferin
farrel
he
said
you
know
better
another
time
wo
you
mcnab
the
schoolmaster
drawled
looking
up
from
the
cards
he
was
holding
it
a
bad
business
getting
between
father
and
son
mcnab
smile
changed
i
was
alludin
to
your
interferin
when
i
had
a
bit
of
business
on
hand
farrel
he
snarled
had
you
a
bit
of
business
on
thad
the
schoolmaster
asked
who

davey
and
did
i
interfere
well
now
you
beat
me
out
with
it
hear
all
about
it
we
all
old
friends
here
mcnab
wrath
surged
so
that
he
could
not
speak
there
now
farrel
cried
he
wo
tell
never
mind
mcnab
you
came
off
very
well
when
young
davey
came
in
i
thought
he
have
you
out
on
the
road
for
a
certainty
and
he
a
pretty
bruiser
showed
him
how
to
put
up
his
fists
myself
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
was
dan
way
of
saying
things
with
a
whimsicality
an
inimitable
geniality
tinged
with
sarcasm
that
brought
the
house
down
when
the
men
in
the
bar
threw
back
their
heads
and
stretched
their
lungs
that
night
thad
did
not
laugh
he
stood
shivering
with
gimlet
flames
in
his
eyes
his
fingers
twitching
restlessly
there
were
drinks
all
round
and
the
schoolmaster
played
another
rubber
before
he
swung
out
of
the
shanty
and
into
the
wind
that
roared
and
beat
over
the
plains
davey
was
waiting
in
the
lee
of
the
garden
fence
round
farrel
cottage
his
little
red
mare
set
with
her
haunches
against
the
wind
what
is
it
davey
the
schoolmaster
asked
when
he
saw
him
it
this
farrel
davey
said
on
a
short
breath
i
quarrelled
with
the
old
man
i
want
a
job
the
cottage
was
in
darkness
but
after
he
had
taken
davey
to
the
stable
and
they
had
turned
red
into
it
they
went
indoors
and
a
light
gleamed
from
the
small
square
windows
until
the
sky
was
waning
on
the
edge
of
the
plains
then
davey
came
to
the
door
and
the
schoolmaster
with
him
it
not
advice
as
i
told
you
but
a
job
i
wanting
the
boy

his
voice
carried
against
the
wind
hoarse
with
anger
and
disappointment
but

job
davey

know
what
it
is
the
schoolmaster
voice
was
troubled

curtly

difficulties
of
his

in

wirree
with
mcnab
mark
against
him
in
the
hills
no
one
would
employ
him
for
fear
of
offending
donald
cameron
but
it
was
neither
mcnab
nor
donald
cameron
the
schoolmaster
was
thinking
of
when
he
tried
to
persuade
the
boy
to
go
home
not
a
word
moved
davey
from
his
purpose
to
be
independent
if
you
take
this
mob
you
will
clear
out
then
and
look
for
another
job
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranges

said
eagerly

the
schoolmaster
replied
but

the
boy
gripped
his
hand
you

said

and
this
job

davey
glanced
at
the
lightening
dome
of
the
sky
it
a
couple
of
hours
to
dawn
yet
he
said
with
a
sigh
then
be
going
chapter
xxviii
conal
himself
on
the
road
met
davey
behind
maitland
slowly
moving
scraggy
cattle
what
the
meaning
of
this
he
asked
striding
into
farrel
kitchen
that
kid
of
cameron
wanted
a
job
the
schoolmaster
said
he
quarrelled
with
his
father
does

know
the
game
the
schoolmaster
nodded
staring
over
his
pipe
into
the
fire
conal
threw
off
his
hat
his
eyes
were
blazing
the
breath
throbbed
against
the
bare
throat
down
which
his
beard
climbed
do
you
mean
to
say
you
the
schoolmaster
eye
on
his
halted
his
tongue

said
slowly
he
knocked
the
ash
from
his
pipe
by
the
way

who
fixed
the
brands
on
that
red
bull

himself
into

the
schoolmaster
murmured
gazing
before
him
he
young
davey
twigged
it

holding
his
tongue
for
what
reason

but
he
told

tracks

take
orders
from
thad
yet
do
you
conal
conal
fidgeted
under
that
glint
in
dan
eye
no
he
growled
you
know
i
do
but
there
no
good
i
can
see
in
running
against
him
what
does
this
kid
want
anyhow
why
there
more
than
a
dozen
of
cameron
cows
in
the
mob
i
after
now
the
log
that
had
been
smouldering
all
day
on
the
open
hearth
broke
and
fell
with
a
shattering
of
embers
tell
you
the
truth
conal
the
schoolmaster
looked
straight
out
before
him
there
something
in
mcnab
eyes
tells
me
he
got
his
suspicions
well
if
he
has
it
time
to
get
out
you
had
luck
so
far
but
there
something
about
mcnab
keeps
making
me
feel
as
if
he
were
promising
himself
something
on
my
account
saying
to
himself
something
coming
to
you
of
course
he
thinks
i
in
this
business
with
you
conal
shifted
his
position
and
swore
impatiently
i
better
keep
out
of
your
way
that
what
it
amounts
to
dan
no
the
schoolmaster
said
not
that
let
mcnab
think
what
he
likes
as
far
as
i
concerned
only
he
has
any
particular
quarrel
with
you
conal
and
he
has
with
me
and
if
he
tripped
you
up
trying
to
get
at
me
it
would
be
a
bad
business
conal
leant
forward
things
are
tightening
up
north
too
he
said
i
mean
to
quit
dan
maitland
knows
i
do
his
business
and
a
little
bit
extra
on
my
own
account
that
does
worry
him
so
long
as
he
gets
a
fancy
price
for
the
beasts
i
want
to
pull
off
this
last
and
then
turn
the
game
down
altogether
i
wish
you
were
in
this
with
me
though
you
never
been
in
any
but

me
down
narrow
valley
to
the
plains
we
laid
a
couple
of
hours
under
cover
in
the
dark
then
the
moon
rose
and
you
should
seen
the
mob
go
stringin
out
across
the
plains
lookin
no
more
than
a
drove
of
rats
in
the
dim
light

a
pretty
good
bunch
rollin
fat
and
prices
high

mean
to

a
whack
of
the
profits

both
men
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
only
the
fire
creaked
in
the
quiet
room
when
i
through
with
this
bit
of
work
i
get
out
and
set
up
on
the
respectable
somewhere

there
something
i
want
to
be
saying
to
you
dan
there
was
another
moment
dreaming
silence
the
schoolmaster
spoke
with
a
sudden
resolution
no
he
said
do
what
you
like
yourself
conal
but
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
jobs
i
not
in
this
i
do
want
to
be
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
proceeds
you
call
dan
conal
rose
from
his
seat
by
the
fire
with
a
gesture
of
disappointment
it
be
full
moon
night
and
i
goin
to
make
a
dash
for
teddy
and
i
ran
up
a
yard
near
the
old
hut
in
narrow
valley
that
what
been
keeping
me
steve
goin
to
send
tucker
and
down
what
about
young
cameron
the
schoolmaster
asked
we
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
you
do
suppose
he
blab
do
you
you
say
he
knows
the
game
already
and
has
but
we
ca
afford
to
take
chances
but
he
not
to
be
dragged
in
conal
conal
threw
back
his
head
laughing
well
i
want
another
man
he
said
as
for
being
dragged
in
he
be
dragged
in
but
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
youngster
who
sit
behind
the
door
and
suck
his
thumbs
while
there
was
moonlighting
in
the
air
it
wo
be
a
case
of
draggin
him
in
but
keepin
him
out
after
all
the
sport
makes
it
worth
while
the
waiting
rush
fight
and
through
of
things
he
stretched
his
long
limbs
but
i
wo
have
davey
with
you
conal
the
schoolmaster
said
angrily
deirdre
came
into
the
room
a
little
bonnet
over
her
head
and
a
long
black
cloak
covering
her
there
was
a
wild
colour
the
wind
had
whipped
into
them
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
shining
you
conal
she
cried
eagerly
when
she
saw
the
tall
figure
of
the
drover
when
did
you
get
back
conal
saw
only
her
shining
eyes
and
the
fluttering
line
of
her
mouth
he
stood
staring
at
her
it
did
not
occur
to
his
simple
mind
to
ask
whether
it
was
for
him
her
eyes
were
shining
only
that
glad
and
eager
note
in
her
voice
pleased
him
the
schoolmaster
had
heard
people
say
that
deirdre
was
beautiful
but
she
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
than
she
was
this
evening
when
she
came
out
of
the
gloom
bringing
into
the
quiet
room
and
across
the
threshold
of
his
troubled
thoughts
her
youth
and
buoyancy
of
spirit
the
whole
secret
and
subtle
essence
of
her
femininity
in
bloom
oh
i
i
just
got
back
and
came
to
see
your
father
at
once
deirdre
was
all
conal
could
say
did
you
have
a
good
trip
she
asked
taking
off
her
hat
and
coat
he
wondered
how
much
of
his
enterprise
she
knew
but
there
was
no
shadow
on
her
face
yes
all
right
he
said
a
little
awkwardly
i
saw
cameron
at
the
store
father
she
continued
busy
with
her
own
thoughts
and
turning
over
in
her
mind
what
cameron
had
said
to
her
what
she
had
said
to
cameron
and
the
plot
light
as
a
spider
web
that
they
had
woven
between
them
for
davey
benefit
and
as
i
was
coming
along
home
she
laughed
blithely
who
did
i
meet
on
the
road
but
pat
glynn
and
he
put
this
little
parcel
into
my
hand
and
said
that
he
had
been
told
to
give
it
to
me
he
made
me
promise
not
to
open
it
until
i
got
in
too
she
tore
the
wrappings
of
brown
paper
and
newspaper
from
a
little
brown
box
opened
it
and
drew
out
a
heavy
necklace
made
of
links
and
twists
of
gold
with
a
locket
set
with
rubies
and
pearls
at
the
end
of
it
oh
is
it
pretty
she
cried
the
schoolmaster
stared
at
it
and
on
conal
face
a
of
resentment
gathered
who
did
he
tell
you
sent
it
the
schoolmaster
asked
he
would
say
only
that
it
was
from
a
admirer
have
you
any
idea
who
it
from
dan
asked
anger
and
anxiety
struggling
within
him
deirdre
looked
up
at
conal
it
not
from
you
conal
she
asked
hesitatingly
he
shook
his
head
perhaps
it
was
davey
she
looked
at
the
schoolmaster
no
he
said
davey
had
no
money
i
know
so
he
could
have
sent
it
you
no
idea
of
any
one
else
no
the
light
had
gone
from
her
face
conal
seized
his
hat
his
mouth
set
in
an
ugly
line
i
go
and
see
pat
he
said
the
door
slammed
behind
him
deirdre
stood
looking
down
on
the
glimmering
thing
in
her
hand
you
not
to
wear
it
deirdre
the
schoolmaster
said
harshly
her
eyes
flew
to
his
he
caught
a
reflection
of
his
own
spirit
in
them
do
you
think
i
be
likely
to
she
said
it
was
hours
later
when
conal
slammed
the
door
of
the
cottage
again
the
suppressed
rage
in
him
burned
to
white
ash
he
gone
pat
glynn
he
said
angrily
i
ransacked
the
place
for
him
he
melted
into
thin
air
i
been
out
along
the
rane
road
and
half
way
into
the
port
but
he
done
the
disappearing
trick
not
a
track
of
him
anywhere
chapter
xxix
so
you
goin
to
steve
deirdre
it
was
thad
mcnab
who
spoke
he
stood
on
the
doorstep
in
the
sunshine
his
yellow
face
thrust
through
the
doorway
the
pale
eyes
in
it
smiling
deirdre
was
putting
the
last
of
her
ribbands
handkerchiefs
and
little
personal
belongings
into
a
small
canvas
mcnab
voice
startled
her
she
glanced
across
at
him
yes
she
said
the
sight
of
his
crooked
figure
there
in
the
doorway
with
the
sunlight
playing
across
it
brought
her
a
sense
of
uneasy
wondering
quite
suddenly
the
night
before
farrel
had
decided
to
go
up
to
the
hills
with
conal
in
the
morning
he
had
told
deirdre
to
follow
them
as
soon
as
she
had
set
the
cottage
in
order
and
collected
her
clothes
she
wanted
to
go
with
them
but
there
were
a
hundred
and
one
things
to
keep
her
busy
in
the
house
dishes
to
scour
floors
to
sweep
covers
and
crockery
to
lock
away
in
the
cupboards
she
had
just
quenched
the
fire
the
ashes
were
smoking
behind
her
under
the
water
she
had
poured
over
them
when
mcnab
appeared
the
township
was
well
astir
by
this
time
the
schoolmaster
had
talked
of
going
to
steve
for
long
enough
she
did
not
expect
anyone
to
be
surprised
at
it
he
did
not
seem
to
expect
that
anyone
would
be
surprised
either
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
rather
suddenly
the
night
before
and
had
told
her
to
ride
out
quietly
and
without
chattering
to
anyone
in
the
morning
yet
mcnab
seemed
surprised
and
annoyed
she
wondered
how
he
knew
so
soon
that
the
schoolmaster
had
gone
with
conal
it
was
very
early
the
sunshine
was
still
of
an
untarnished
brilliance
mary
ann
ducks
and
geese
were
making
their
first
trip
in
wavering
white
and
mottled
lines
to
the
shallow
pools
left
by
the
tide
beside
the
river
deirdre
could
see
them
through
the
open
doorway
mighty
sudden
the
schoolmaster
made
up
his
mind
eh
my
blackbird
thad
said
with
what
for
him
was
geniality
though
geniality
on
his
voice
had
a
sour
sound
he
shuffled
into
the
room
and
stood
near
her
deirdre
folded
a
ribband
and
packed
it
into
her
bag
she
made
a
great
appearance
of
being
busy
going
to
and
from
the
kitchen
and
the
cupboards
wrapping
up
and
putting
into
the
bag
all
manner
of
things
that
she
had
not
meant
to
take
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
still
to
look
at
or
to
talk
to
mcnab
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
how
the
sight
of
him
had
set
her
heart
throbbing
a
little
nervous
pulse
fluttering
in
her
throat
his
nearness
filled
her
with
a
sick
fear
but
she
would
not
have
had
mcnab
guess
it
she
knew
the
shrewd
sharpness
of
those
pale
shifty
eyes
of
his
her
eyes
met
his
clearly
there
was
not
a
flicker
of
the
smooth
white
lids
above
them
oh
no
she
said
he
fixed
to
go
sometime
ago
well
he
might
said
so
replied
mcnab
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
something
can
i
tell
him
what
it
is
his
eyes
fell
before
the
clear
innocence
of
her
gaze
he
moved
uneasily
no
he
said
i
dursay
i
find
time
to
go
and
see
him
up
at
one
of
these
days
tell
him
that
i
come
soon
he
chuckled
a
moment
they
tell
me
he
went
on
eyeing
her
narrowly
they
tell
me
he
taken
that
cub
of
cameron
with
him
he
did
not
wait
for
her
reply
but
ran
on
the
malice
that
was
never
far
from
it
an
undercurrent
in
his
voice
again
he
not
very
clever
your
father
my
dear
for
all
he
a
schoolmaster
or
he
would
have
done
that
give
him
my
respects
and
say
i
hope
the
hills
be
for
the
good
of
his
health
and
you
i
hope
you
be
enjoyin
up
there
though
it
no
place
to
be
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
south
well
i
have
to
be
going
now
deirdre
moved
quickly
he
had
edged
nearer
and
nearer
her
until
his
breath
touched
her
face
as
she
pulled
the
strings
of
her
bag
together
socks
has
been
saddled
this
half
hour
father
be
glad
to
see
you
any
day
at
steve
i
sure
mcnab
she
added
backing
towards
the
door
mcnab
got
between
her
and
it
he
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
my
the
pretty
neck
it
is
he
gurgled
his
voice
deep
in
his
throat
but
where
the
gold
chain
pat
glynn
told
me
he
had
for
you
from
a
admirer
no
less
a
gold
chain
it
was
with
rubies
and
pearls
on
it
fit
for
a
lady
to
wear
and
there
more
for
you
where
it
come
from
the
one
that
sent
it
would
dress
you
up
like
the
finest
lady
in
the
land
pat
said
if
you
would
deirdre
wrenched
herself
away
from
the
clutching
hands
they
caught
at
her
again
you
must
kiss
me
then
pretty
he
whispered
she
saw
the
flame
in
his
eyes
the
wry
smile
on
his
lips
the
chestnut
was
standing
saddled
his
bridle
over
the
post
by
the
door
deirdre
leapt
to
his
back
her
bag
in
her
hand
thad
followed
her
and
stood
watching
her
rubbing
his
hands
together
so
shy
my
blackbird
so
shy
he
exclaimed
almost
gleefully
never
mind
another
day
perhaps
deirdre
looked
down
at
him
her
eyes
blazing
if
father
heard
you
talking
like
that
he
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
she
cried
passionately
mcnab
lost
countenance
eh
would
he
he
snarled
the
fear
of
death
and
revenge
the
dealing
out
to
himself
of
what
he
had
dealt
so
often
to
others
was
the
continual
dogging
terror
that
haunted
him
then
he
smiled
again
and
chuckled
if
i
let
him
eh
my
pretty
he
said
gazing
up
at
her
if
i
let
him
i
would
advise
you
to
to
tell
him
create
bad
feelin
between
us
it
be
a
pity
seeing
me
and
father
pretty
good
friends
and
they
say
it
better
to
make
a
friend
than
an
enemy
of
mcnab
besides
it
was
only
my
little
bit
of
fun
deirdre
have
i
known
you
since
you
were
so
high
deirdre
turned
the
chestnut
to
the
road
me
dear
mcnab
called
and
my
respects
to
the
schoolmaster
do
forget
tell
him
i
think
it
was
mean
to
do
me
the
trick
of
clearin
out
without
lettin
me
know
though
me
wantin
to
stand
by
him
in
any
little
bit
of
trouble
that
comin
to
him
but
i
be
comin
up
to
see
him
soon
sooner
than
he
thinks
there
was
a
warning
a
veiled
threat
in
the
words
as
the
chestnut
flew
out
along
the
green
roadsides
that
mean
voice
with
its
geniality
and
malice
reverberated
in
deirdre
ears
she
looked
back
when
she
was
some
distance
out
on
the
flat
road
that
wound
over
the
plains
to
the
hills
and
saw
mcnab
hobbling
back
towards
the
whitewashed
irregular
and
dilapidated
huts
of
the
wirree
township
her
eyes
went
out
to
the
ranges
with
an
eager
sigh
she
quickened
the
chestnut
pace
again
with
a
rub
of
her
heels
on
his
sleek
side
chapter

deirdre
spirits
rose
as
white
socks
climbed
the
steep
track
of
the
foothills
she
drew
the
strong
sweet
leafy
smells
of
the
trees
with
eager
breaths
tying
her
hat
to
the
saddle
she
threw
back
her
head
to
the
sunshine
exclaiming
with
delight
to
see
the
red
and
brown
blossom
out
among
the
ferns
sunlight
making
the
young
leaves
hang
upon
the
saplings
in
flakes
of
translucent
green
and
amber
she
talked
to
socks
and
called
to
the
birds
that
flitted
across
the
track
it
was
so
good
to
be
in
the
hills
again
climbing
the
long
winding
path
through
the
trees
she
wanted
to
catch
the
sunshine
in
her
hands
it
hung
in
such
yarns
of
palpable
gold
stuff
across
the
track
she
sang
softly
to
herself
gazing
into
the
blue
haze
that
stood
among
the
near
trees
the
valleys
were
steeped
in
sun
mists
her
little
horse
ambled
easily
through
them
and
when
he
climbed
the
steep
hill
sides
she
slipped
from
his
back
and
walked
beside
him
asking
him
again
and
again
if
it
were
not
good
to
be
going
to
steve
to
the
paddocks
where
socks
himself
had
flung
up
his
heels
an
unbroken
colt
and
all
the
gay
careless
days
of
her
childhood
had
been
spent
she
felt
as
if
they
were
leaving
the
reek
and
squalor
of
the
wirree
river
for
ever
and
yet
the
vague
uneasiness
mcnab
words
had
evoked
hovered
in
her
mind
his
eyes
gestures
ugly
writhing
smile
kept
recurring
to
her
she
was
anxious
to
get
to
the
schoolmaster
and
give
him
mcnab
message
to
know
what
he
would
make
of
it
what
harm
was
it
mcnab
could
do
her
father
she
knew
that
dan
feared
him
in
a
curious
watchful
way
and
the
trouble
that
was
coming
to
him
what
had
mcnab
meant
by
that
this
business
conal
was
on
what
was
it
why
had
she
been
told
nothing
about
it
the
way
mcnab
had
talked
to
her
too
disquieted
her
all
day
a
premonition
of
trouble
haunted
her
she
urged
the
chestnut
on
when
they
splashed
through
a
creek
at
midday
she
let
him
stand
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
middle
of
it
dip
his
patchy
white
nose
into
the
clear
cold
water
and
sough
it
up
noisily
a
little
further
on
near
a
gully
in
which
the
mists
were
unfathomable
the
trees
grey
as
sea
lichen
in
its
depths
she
sat
down
by
the
roadside
and
ate
her
sandwich
of
bread
and
cheese
and
had
a
drink
from
her
bottle
of
milk
davey
and
she
had
often
made
excursions
to
long
gully
when
they
were
children
to
hear
the
they
dropped
mellow
notes
through
the
stillness
of
the
trees
that
climbed
the
gully
steep
sides
davey
and
she
had
crept
warily
through
the
undergrowth
on
the
for
snakes
and
had
sat
still
for
hours
behind
a
fallen
tree
listening
for
the
plomp
plomp
plomp
of
the
shy
birds
notes
of
purest
melody
thrown
into
the
pool
of
the
silence
a
dead
tree
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
track
deirdre
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
magpie
nest
in
it
and
that
the
maggies
would
swoop
down
on
her
and
on
davey
in
the
springtime
if
there
were
young
birds
in
the
nest
screaming
and
flapping
their
wings
and
sometimes
getting
in
a
peck
which
brought
the
blood
to
her
freckled
face
or
to
davey
she
glanced
up
to
see
if
the
magpies
were
about
that
day
but
they
were
not
so
gaunt
and
tall
the
dead
tree
stood
its
branches
seemed
to
strike
against
the
sky
they
rattled
with
the
sound
of
bones
in
the
wind
the
sun
and
thrashing
winter
storms
had
bleached
it
and
there
were
black
wales
and
scars
where
a
fire
had
eaten
into
the
wood
above
the
hacked
zone
that
the
axe
of
a
settler
had
made
when
he
it
years
ago
as
long
as
she
could
remember
the
dead
tree
had
stood
there
gaunt
and
ghostly
with
the
tangle
of
living
trees
behind
it
they
were
clad
with
their
shifting
whispering
garment
of
leaves
all
the
year
round
and
decked
with
flowers
in
the
springtime
but
the
dead
tree
was
naked
it
might
have
been
an
avenging
spirit
of
the
wilderness
it
stood
with
an
air
of
such
tragic
desolation
by
the
wayside
there
were
dead
trees
all
along
the
hill
roads
scores
of
them
in
the
paddocks
the
ripping
crack
and
thunder
of
their
crashing
to
the
earth
could
be
heard
in
the
dead
of
night
sometimes
when
they
thought
of
it
country
folk
moved
from
under
a
dead
tree
deirdre
looked
up
at
this
one
it
seemed
to
waver
in
the
wind
she
shook
the
crumbs
from
her
skirt
and
caught
the
chestnut
bridle
were
overhanging
the
bank
on
that
turn
of
the
road
near
where
the
school
had
been
when
she
passed
the
chimney
of
the
hut
was
still
standing
though
the
wild
creepers
had
thrown
long
vines
about
it
had
clambered
over
the
twisted
fruit
trees
it
threw
its
shower
of
feathery
seeding
over
the
apple
branches
deirdre
had
meant
to
take
socks
into
the
clearing
and
let
him
feed
on
the
wild
oats
and
clover
matting
it
while
she
investigated
the
forlorn
chimney
and
the
fruit
trees
and
flowers
growing
near
where
her
garden
had
been
seeking
in
the
tangled
undergrowth
for
the
flowers
she
had
planted
long
ago
she
had
thought
she
would
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
well
listen
for
the
great
green
frogs
to
go
dropping
into
the
water
and
weave
her
dreams
of
the
old
times
for
awhile
watching
the
sunlight
make
a
patchwork
of
dancing
light
with
the
shadows
the
leaves
of
the
fruit
trees
cast
on
the
beaten
yard
about
the
doorway
of
the
hut
but
she
went
straight
by
with
scarcely
a
glance
at
the
grey
chimney
and
the
tangled
garden
greenery
across
which
a
tall
sweet
english
rose
nodded
gaily
she
only
stopped
a
moment
to
pull
a
trail
of
from
the
bank
near
the
house
she
wondered
if
davey
had
remembered
the
place
and
the
flowers
when
he
passed
the
day
before
she
looked
down
at
the
scarlet
flowers
with
a
little
smile
as
she
pinned
them
into
her
dress
but
thought
of
the
flowers
and
of
davey
lasted
only
a
moment
she
was
eager
to
ask
the
schoolmaster
for
an
explanation
and
to
hear
from
him
what
they
had
to
fear
from
mcnab
when
she
saw
dan
with
the
sun
behind
him
coming
towards
her
on
his
big
grey
nag
whose
nose
was
so
like
a
kangaroo
that
they
called
him
the
she
quickened
her
pace
her
heart
swelling
with
love
at
the
sight
of
him
and
at
the
thought
of
the
concern
which
had
sent
him
back
along
the
road
to
meet
her
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
with
a
breathless
little
glad
sob
when
she
came
up
to
him
what
is
it
he
asked
his
anxiety
leaping
instinctively
at
the
sight
of
her
face
perhaps
i
foolish
she
said
quickly
it
something
mcnab
said
before
i
left
this
morning
it
was
so
much
what
he
said
but
the
way
he
said
it
and
i
been
thinking
of
it
all
the
way
wondering
what
he
meant
is
there
any
harm
he
could
do
us
what
did
he
say
farrel
asked
he
came
just
as
i
was
going
deirdre
told
him
and
he
seemed
annoyed
that
you
did
tell
him
you
were
going
said
there
was
something
particular
he
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
then
just
as
i
was
going
he
said
was
a
mean
trick
clearin
out
without
lettin
me
know
such
old
friends
as
we
are
too
and
me
wanting
to
stand
by
him
in
any
little
bit
of
trouble
that
coming
to
him
but
i
be
coming
up
to
see
him
one
of
these
days
soon
sooner
than
he
thinks
it
was
so
much
what
he
said
as
the
way
he
said
it
made
me
think
deirdre
hesitated
looking
at
her
father
face
she
knew
that
he
was
troubled
that
there
was
enough
in
this
to
disturb
him
without
telling
him
what
else
mcnab
had
said
to
her
they
rode
on
in
silence
the
horses
brushing
the
schoolmaster
head
was
bent
in
thought
he
rode
in
easy
slouching
negligent
fashion
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
he
was
not
alone
deirdre
spoke
first
her
voice
had
a
quick
intensity
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
way
to
ask
you
what
this
business
is
conal
on
and
if
you
are
with
him
or
not
she
said
i
ought
to
know
i
not
a
child
and
i
with
you
whatever
it
is
i
have
an
idea
but
you
ought
to
tell
me
more
than
ever
now
that
mcnab
has
his
suspicions
the
schoolmaster
looked
into
her
steady
eyes
are
you
in
this
with
conal
she
asked
i
was
until
last
night
he
said
i
changed
my
mind
suddenly
and
joined
him
what
made
you
she
inquired
breathlessly
he
did
not
reply
i
know
it
was
that
necklace
the
reason
had
come
to
her
instantly
i
a
now
deirdre
he
said
low
and
bitterly
there
mighty
little
i
can
do
and
there
be
less
presently
i
want
enough
money
to
get
us
away
from
here
and
keep
us
by
and
by
when
he
did
not
say
it
but
she
knew
that
he
meant
when
the
night
of
blindness
had
fallen
on
him
it
was
because
you
were
afraid
for
me
she
murmured
afraid
because
of
that
necklace
who
it
might
have
come
from
afraid
he
nodded
and
if
you
get
the
money
we
can
go
away
from
here
and
never
come
back
to
the
wirree
river
any
more
the
schoolmaster
smiled
he
was
surprised
at
the
eagerness
of
her
voice
yes
he
said
but
that
was
what
was
bothering
me
i
thought
you
would
not
like
to
be
leaving
the
place
you
were
always
wanting
to
come
back
when
we
were
away
before
oh
a
little
fluttering
sigh
went
out
of
her
but
i
be
glad
to
go
now
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
there
moonlight
and
we
want
to
get
a
mob
of
wild
cattle
he
said
quietly
a
couple
of
hundred
are
eating
their
heads
off
in
the
scrub
above
narrow
valley
do
you
remember
when
we
were
living
here
riding
up
the
range
sometimes
we
start
a
cow
or
steer
and
it
would
plunge
away
through
the
brushwood
scared
as
a
rabbit
after
the
fires
more
breakaways
joined
the
mob
we
lost
a
couple
of
cows
so
did
steve
others
did
too
well
i
told
conal
about
these
beasts
a
while
ago
he
made
up
his
mind
to
get
them
he
and
steve
black
boy
run
up
a
stockyard
near
mcmillan
hut
in
narrow
valley
and
conal
and
he
mean
to
take
the
mob
with
that
lot
of
maitland
cattle
he
brought
down
for
fattening
not
this
but
last
trip
up
by
the
snowy
river
into
new
south
wales
it
is
as
you
may
say
permitted
by
law
he
continued
but
most
of
the
cattle
men
who
can
do
it
do
even
the
squatters
when
they
get
a
chance
down
here
they
do
think
scrub
cattle
worth
the
getting
rosses
staked
a
couple
of
horses
a
month
or
two
ago
and
lost
a
good
dog
after
this
mob
cameron
does
think
them
worth
his
while
so
why
should
we
have
them
if
we
can
get
them
if
we
get
a
couple
of
beasts
with
brands
on
them
among
the
wild
ones
it
may
be
worth
drafting
them
out
and
driving
them
back
to
the
hills
but
the
hair
grows
thick
on
scrub
cattle
there
no
need
to
be
brand
hunting
if
conal
were
such
a
fine
stockman
we
could
do
it
there
nobody
like
him
when
we
pull
off
this
deal
we
go
away
you
and
conal
and
i
if
the
price
of
cattle
keeps
up
there
be
enough
to
divide
among
the
three
of
us
davey
got
to
have
his
share
if
he
in
conal
offered
him
a
third
to
work
with
him
and
run
the
mob
through
to
the
border
he
a
man
short
i
been
trying
to
persuade
davey
to
keep
out
of
it
but
there
a
lot
of
donald
cameron
in
him
he
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
says
he
wants
a
job
and
has
got
one
and
that
enough
for
him
for
the
present
they
had
come
within
sight
of
steve
shanty
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
when
they
drew
rein
before
steve
conal
lounged
out
of
the
house
the
dogs
that
had
started
up
snarling
at
the
approach
of
horses
stretched
themselves
again
in
the
dust
by
the
verandahs
and
lay
with
their
heads
low
on
their
forelegs
deirdre
stood
a
moment
looking
about
her
her
face
under
the
flat
little
yellow
straw
hat
crossed
by
a
red
ribband
that
tied
under
her
chin
was
very
winsome
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
and
laughter
when
she
saw
steve
in
the
doorway
she
ran
to
him
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
oh
it
good
to
be
here
again
uncle
stevie
he
chuckled
delightedly
there
a
woman
you
are
deirdre
a
woman
y
grown
what
else
would
i
grow
she
asked
gaily
it
good
to
be
anywhere
you
are
deirdre
conal
said
coming
up
and
standing
beside
them
all
his
love
in
his
eyes
she
laughed
glancing
up
at
him
and
steve
laughed
to
see
the
way
the
wind
blew
davey
by
the
open
door
watched
them
but
deirdre
did
not
see
him
when
she
moved
to
go
in
he
stood
away
from
the
door
for
her
to
pass
he
saw
the
that
she
had
tucked
into
her
gown
under
her
chin
she
heard
the
catch
in
his
breath
and
hesitated
conal
saw
her
hand
go
out
to
him
he
saw
davey
take
it
but
he
did
not
see
the
eyes
she
turned
on
him
nor
hear
her
say
with
a
tremulous
quiver
of
the
lips
they
saying
they
glad
to
see
me
will
you
not
say
so
too
davey
the
schoolmaster
coming
back
from
the
stables
called
conal
mcnab
been
to
see
deirdre
he
said
he
got
an
idea
something
in
the
wind
she
seems
to
think
it
just
as
well
we
fixed
for
conal
it
wo
give
him
any
time
to
get
busy
but
had
you
better
be
getting
down
to
cover
before
it
much
later
it
only
a
couple
of
miles
by
the
track
teddy
goes
there
time
enough
yet
conal
replied
his
eyes
on
the
open
door
gaping
dark
against
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
davey
followed
deirdre
indoors
teddy
bringing
in
the
horses
now
you
better
get
in
and
have
something
to
eat
send
davey
to
me
farrel
said
impatiently
conal
crossed
the
verandah
it
was
in
the
wide
kitchen
that
he
found
davey
deirdre
was
standing
near
him
only
the
glow
of
the
firelight
lighted
the
great
room
but
that
was
sufficient
to
show
him
the
sombre
steadfast
gaze
with
which
davey
regarded
the
girl
and
something
subdued
in
the
droop
of
her
figure
a
something
of
emotion
humiliation
in
her
averted
head
dan
wants
you
he
said
to
davey
davey
had
stared
at
deirdre
as
though
he
were
trying
to
read
in
her
face
what
his
heart
ached
to
know
and
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
read
and
know
waiting
for
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
with
a
tremulous
expectancy
a
moment
more
might
have
ended
the
griefs
and
heartache
between
them
but
conal
spoke
and
davey
wheeled
out
of
the
kitchen
conal
strode
over
to
the
table
near
which
davey
bad
been
he
swung
his
leg
over
it
and
watched
deirdre
as
she
put
cups
and
saucers
plates
and
knives
on
one
end
of
it
she
cut
some
bread
and
buttered
it
there
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
a
colour
in
her
cheeks
she
had
watched
davey
go
with
a
little
gesture
of
impatience
a
fluttering
sigh
conal
saw
that
she
turned
to
him
gaily
poured
out
tea
for
him
chattering
but
avoided
his
eyes
he
watched
her
with
a
smouldering
suspicion
suddenly
he
leant
forward
and
caught
her
hand
his
swart
leathern
face
swung
towards
her
the
brilliant
hawk
eyes
of
conal
the
fighter
leapt
into
hers
you
to
marry
me
deirdre
he
said
his
voice
hoarse
and
throbbing
in
his
throat
she
shrank
from
him
with
a
little
breathless
exclamation
do
do
that
he
cried
passionately
do
look
at
me
like
that
deirdre
conal
she
gasped
in
his
eyes
rose
the
appeal
of
dumb
unfathomable
devouring
tenderness
say
you
love
me
say
you
will
deirdre
he
begged
his
face
was
turned
towards
her
humble
and
mysteriously
moved
a
strong
light
in
his
eyes
so
absorbed
were
they
that
they
did
not
hear
or
if
they
heard
paid
no
attention
to
the
grind
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
before
the
shanty
the
yelping
and
snarling
of
dogs
that
announced
the
arrival
of
a
vehicle
at
steve
and
such
late
arrivals
were
not
usual
i
had
my
way
with
women
they
told
you
tales
of
me
i
know
conal
pleaded
but
there
never
a
woman
i
cared
for

and
you
he
broke
off
impatiently
there
no
telling
you
how
i
care
for
you
i
have
got
words
besides
it
chokes
me
to
speak
of
it
raises
a
storm
in
me
that
there
no
holding
by
and
by
when
this
is
all
over
we
go
away
you
and
the
schoolmaster
and
me
oh

a
good
husband

give
me
word
wo

there
were
voices
in
the
bar
beyond
but
they
did
not
heed
them
conal
was
thinking
only
of
her
and
his
pleading
conal
dear
deirdre
said
if
you
would
talk
like
this
any
more
her
eyes
fell
from
his
he
snatched
her
hand
from
the
flower
under
her
chin
where
it
had
fallen
is
it
him
you
love
he
asked
fiercely
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
back
door
by
which
davey
had
gone
out
is
it
tell
me
i
let
no
man
come
between
you
and
me
deirdre
i
kill
him
if
he
tries
to
the
door
from
the
with
the
sunlight
splashing
on
the
benches
and
bottles
behind
it
opened
and
steve
and
the
new
arrival
came
into
the
kitchen
and
who
is
it
y
be
killing
now
conal
asked
mcnab
genially
he
glanced
from
conal
to
deirdre
you
if
you
do
get
out
of
my
way
yelled
conal
quivering
with
rage
brushing
past
mcnab
he
flung
out
of
the
room
his
spurs
jingling
they
heard
the
irons
on
his
boots
click
on
the
stones
of
the
yard
there
now
cried
steve
tremulously
he
been
making
love
to
you
has
he
deirdre
all
the
boys
be
making
love
to
you
deirdre
and
now
here
mcnab
come
up
to
see
the
schoolmaster
most
he
was
altogether
flustered
at
this
unexpected
visit
of
mcnab
and
at
his
wits
end
what
to
say
next
dan
was
in
the
paddock
with
the
black
boy
bringing
in
the
horses
for
the
night
work
and
here
was
mcnab
on
the
top
of
it
all
deirdre
wits
were
quicker
to
work
than
his
she
realised
what
mcnab
being
in
the
shanty
that
night
might
mean
to
the
schoolmaster
conal
davey
and
herself
she
smiled
at
him
mcnab
had
not
seen
her
smile
like
that
except
at
conal
and
that
was
on
the
night
of
the
schoolmaster
return
at
the
dance
at
hegarty
why
there
a
surprise
to
play
on
me
mr
mcnab
she
cried
merrily
you
to
be
coming
up
the
hills
and
never
say
a
word
about
it
this
morning
there
i
was
riding
along
by
myself
and
might
have
had
a
seat
in
the
cart
beside
you
mcnab
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
her
greeting
he
imagined
that
she
had
been
thinking
over
his
attentions
of
the
morning
and
was
feeling
flattered
by
them
for
after
all
was
he
not
thadeus
mcnab
and
the
gossips
said
the
richest
man
in
the
country
side
not
excepting
donald
cameron
himself
if
the
truth
were
known
he
thought
that
she
was
willing
to
coquet
with
him
and
that
too
the
hint
about
the
gold
chain
might
not
have
been
in
vain
he
warmed
to
her
smile
preened
himself
and
gave
himself
half
a
dozen
gallant
airs
on
the
spot
every
male
instinct
in
him
responded
to
her
effort
to
be
charming
and
now
everybody
had
tea
but
me
she
continued
so
we
can
just
sit
down
and
have
some
together
mcnab
sat
down
beside
her
at
the
big
table
on
which
she
had
spread
a
white
cloth
a
generous
and
genial
glow
suffused
him
for
the
moment
he
forgot
the
reason
of
his
visit
deirdre
had
put
it
all
out
of
his
head
with
that
smile
of
hers
the
sound
of
her
merry
voice
set
every
fibre
of
him
tingling
and
thrilling
as
his
fibres
had
never
tingled
and
thrilled
before
chapter
xxxi
in
the
yard
conal
told
the
schoolmaster
of
mcnab
arrival
settles
us
farrel
said
shortly
that
what
he
came
to
do
and
we
ca
afford
to
let
him
think
there
anything
on
he
given
his
suspicions
to
most
likely
and
the
delay
give
them
time
to
get
the
word
out
about
us
along
the
road
so
all
we
can
do
is
lie
low
play
civil
to
mcnab
let
him
think
he
on
the
wrong
track
then
when
this
blows
over
in
a
couple
of
months
perhaps
conal
swore
bitterly
i
could
have
wrung
his
neck
when
i
saw
him
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
me
hands
off
him
he
said
do
be
giving
the
game
away
conal
the
schoolmaster
cautioned
mind
we
not
taking
chances
it
be
a
couple
of
hours
to
moonrise
after
dark
conal
said
restively
glancing
at
the
waning
sky
if
you
could
keep
him
busy
playing
cards
and
drinking
let
him
think
we
were
upset
at
seeing
him
and
he
seems
to
be
settlin
down
and
looking
foolish
findin
we
all
about
i
might
walk
out
after
a
bit
i
could
get
the
beasts
with
davey
and
that
blithering
sally
easily
worth
a
couple
of
men
with
cattle
do
you
think
i
likely
to
be
able
to
keep
mcnab
so
busy
he
notice
you
were
walking
out
the
schoolmaster
asked
impatiently
you
and
davey
had
better
come
in
and
hang
round
loose
presently
he
went
towards
the
house
his
greeting
of
mcnab
was
as
lukewarm
negligent
and
friendly
as
it
always
was
deirdre
saw
no
flicker
of
anxiety
in
his
face
mcnab
eyes
were
quick
and
keen
on
it
for
the
first
few
minutes
but
finding
no
trace
of
repressed
excitement
not
a
spark
of
the
impatience
he
expected
but
only
a
whimsical
smile
to
convey
that
the
schoolmaster
knew
why
he
had
come
and
was
amused
at
the
reason
he
dropped
into
the
chair
he
had
taken
and
sought
to
cover
the
unexpectedness
of
his
visit
by
unusual
affability
he
was
sitting
in
steve
chair
by
the
fire
when
farrel
came
into
the
room
that
was
kitchen
and
in
general
at
steve
deirdre
slipped
out
with
a
jug
for
water
as
the
schoolmaster
came
in
glancing
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
her
talking
to
conal
in
the
yard
when
she
returned
her
laughter
and
gaiety
surprised
him
she
set
a
jug
of
grog
between
steve
and
mcnab
on
the
table
near
ncnab
elbow
the
schoolmaster
swore
beneath
his
breath
when
he
saw
mcnab
eyes
on
her
he
trembled
with
rage
when
he
heard
deirdre
talking
to
mcnab
but
her
eyes
met
his
reassuringly
he
caught
their
message
calm
and
purposeful
he
knew
that
she
was
playing
the
woman
to
mcnab
and
why
the
knowledge
angered
and
humiliated
him
davey
and
conal
came
into
the
long
room
they
threw
themselves
on
a
bench
near
the
door
conal
taking
a
pipe
from
his
belt
smoked
morosely
davey
did
not
look
at
mcnab
and
mcnab
took
no
notice
of
him
enjoying
his
position
of
importance
by
the
fireside
and
chuckling
over
the
gay
chatter
deirdre
threw
to
him
we
eat
our
heads
off
up
here
mcnab
she
said
and
sleep
davey
and
conal
there
to
see
them
yawning
over
their
supper
think
they
never
seen
a
bed
for
weeks
they
been
saying
going
to
turn
in
early
because
they
to
go
off
mustering
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
father
and
steve
would
have
sat
here
dozing
by
the
fire
for
a
while
and
then
gone
off
to
bed
too
i
was
thinking
i
would
have
to
take
out
my
sewing
and
talk
to
the
cat
till
it
was
a
decent
hour
to
be
saying
my
prayers
but
now
you
have
a
game
of
cards
with
me
though
i
do
suppose
conal
and
davey
go
to
bed
early
now
seeing
we
got
company
davey
sat
bolt
upright
against
the
wall
it
froze
the
blood
in
his
veins
to
hear
her
on
such
terms
of
easy
familiarity
with
mcnab
conal
shifted
uneasily
but
we
can
get
along
without
them
ca
we
deirdre
asked
blithely
there
no
need
for
them
to
be
sitting
up
trying
to
be
polite
is
there
none
at
all
mcnab
chuckled
he
thought
he
was
getting
on
very
well
with
deirdre
and
that
she
was
playing
him
off
against
conal
and
davey
in
a
spirit
of
pique
right
mcnab
see
you
in
the
morning
conal
said
angrily
he
swung
out
of
the
room
davey
followed
him
and
now
for
the
business
that
brought
you
mcnab
mighty
kind
of
you
to
have
come
after
me
with
it
the
schoolmaster
sat
down
before
thad
mcnab
facing
him
squarely
his
one
eye
played
on
mcnab
shifty
face
there
was
just
the
faintest
ironical
emphasis
in
his
voice
mcnab
stirred
uneasily
fact
is
he
began
his
eyes
shifted
under
the
schoolmaster
gaze
fact
is
we
wanting
a
school
in
the
wirree
he
plunged
desperately
before
you
go
away
i
thought
i
thought
not
knowing
exactly
what
your
plans
were
i
have
a
talk
to
you
about
it
the
place
is
gettin
a
bad
name
with
the
children
growing
up
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
mark
for
their
names
in
the
hills
of
course
you
taught
the
first
generation
as
you
might
say
so
the
older
ones
can
teach
the
others
coming
on
but
down
there
it
different
we
never
had
any
school
or
school
teachers
the
people
ca
pay
enough
just
a
few
of
them
to
make
it
worth
your
while
but
if
we
built
a
school
got
all
together
it
might
be
a
good
thing
i
maybe
put
up
the
money
for
the
school
maybe
he
fidgeted
in
his
seat
he
did
not
want
to
commit
himself
too
far
and
yet
he
was
irritably
conscious
of
the
weakness
of
his
explanation
unless
he
did
he
had
a
suspicion
than
dan
farrel
was
laughing
at
him
up
his
sleeve
too
an
was
rising
in
him
there
was
an
ominous
silence
a
moment
of
suspicion
and
suspense
a
word
from
either
might
have
been
a
spark
to
the
train
of
enmity
between
them
deirdre
broke
the
silence
she
threw
down
a
pack
of
cards
and
pulled
her
chair
up
to
the
table
all
that
keep
till
mcnab
wo
it
she
asked
have
a
game
of
euchre
with
steve
and
me
now
let
play
more
exciting
father
can
think
over
what
you
said
and
tell
you
in
the
morning
yes
yes
you
think
it
over
farrel
mcnab
said
eagerly
he
was
glad
enough
to
shelve
discussion
of
this
urgent
matter
which
had
brought
him
from
the
wirree
to
talk
to
the
schoolmaster
seeing
that
it
was
not
at
all
urgent
and
did
not
look
like
it
deirdre
pushed
the
bottle
of
rum
between
him
and
steve
she
sat
opposite
to
them
the
broad
yellow
glare
of
the
dip
on
her
face
the
liquor
was
already
beginning
to
warm
mcnab
brain
his
head
was
steady
enough
on
his
shoulders
but
there
was
a
glow
within
him
he
watched
the
face
of
the
girl
before
him
as
in
a
dream
farrel
saw
the
arabesques
of
red
and
blue
the
cards
made
under
the
light
as
she
threw
them
on
the
table
he
heard
her
gleeful
and
triumphant
exclamations
he
realised
what
she
was
doing
for
him
was
sore
and
angry
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
play
up
to
her
he
sat
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
just
out
of
the
light
after
a
while
his
head
drooped
deirdre
laughter
flashed
look
at
father
she
cried
he
dead
with
sleep
farrel
started
and
stared
at
her
sleepily
it
no
good
your
blinking
like
an
owl
and
pretending
you
taking
forty
winks
you
better
go
to
bed
and
have
done
with
it
she
said
he
struggled
to
his
feet
i
he
muttered
think
i
will
he
added
after
a
moment
and
be
sure
you
see
the
fires
are
out
before
you
turn
in
deirdre
you
not
to
be
staying
up
late
either
i
wo
have
her
getting
too
fond
of
the
cards
steve
he
stumbled
across
the
room
to
the
far
end
where
a
screen
of
brushwood
and
bagging
against
the
back
of
the
shanty
made
another
small
room
deirdre
laughed
again
i
winning
all
the
time
she
said
gaily
so
they
wo
want
to
play
long
the
cards
went
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
table
to
the
tune
of
her
exclamations
and
the
chime
of
her
laughter
the
muttered
oaths
and
exclamations
of
steve
and
mcnab
steve
was
soggy
with
drink
but
mcnab
was
not
as
drunk
as
he
seemed
his
eyes
caught
hers
with
a
curious
expression
when
the
schoolmaster
had
gone
from
the
room
and
who
the
man
conal
going
to
kill
for
comin
between
you
deirdre
he
asked
how
do
i
know
she
said
a
little
nervously
it
the
man
sent
you
the
gold
chain
mcnab
murmured
his
eyes
glimmered
at
her
out
of
the
darkness
they
tell
me
conal
went
round
like
a
madman
looking
for
pat
glynn
to
tell
him
who
it
was
threatening
to
break
the
last
bone
in
pat
body
if
he
would
speak
yes
i
think
it
was
him
deirdre
said
meeting
his
eyes
conal
said
if
ever
he
found
him
he
conal
a
hot
head
does
mean
half
he
says
mcnab
muttered
but
he
means
that
i
sure
deirdre
said
and
conal
so
strong
look
at
his
hands
he
could
put
them
round
a
man
throat
and
wring
the
life
out
of
it
just
as
easily
as
you
wring
a
bird
neck
mcnab
and
he
a
dead
shot
too
conal
they
say
eh
then
it
somebody
neck
he
be
wringing
or
somebody
he
be
shooting
for
sure
mcnab
said
for
it
not
him
you
be
marrin
and
it
not
him
your
heart
set
on
it
the
other
the
quivering
of
her
face
a
dilating
of
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
that
were
wells
of
darkness
told
him
that
he
had
scored
he
leant
forward
following
up
his
advantage
eagerly
and
it
not
conal
for
all
his
blustering
i
afraid
of
my
pretty
he
whispered
his
eyes
were
narrowed
the
smile
in
them
leaping
across
his
face
it
not
conal
for
all
his
blustering
though
i
dursay
think
he
kill
me
for
love
of
you
and
you
break
his
heart
for
love
of
somebody
else
by
way
of
reward
but
it
me
all
the
same
that
get
you
deirdre
pushed
back
her
chair
then
she
remembered
the
part
she
had
been
playing
all
the
evening
she
steadied
herself
putting
her
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
looked
down
into
mcnab
eyes
laughing
why
she
cried
you
as
drunk
as
drunk
mcnab
and
so
is
steve
you
better
see
each
other
to
bed
i
going
myself
she
went
across
to
the
next
the
schoolmaster
where
she
slept
when
she
had
heard
steve
shambling
before
ncnab
to
the
room
off
the
bar
where
occasional
visitors
were
put
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
raked
over
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
put
out
a
flare
that
was
burning
low
in
its
tin
of
rancid
fat
and
belching
forth
streams
of
heavy
black
smoke
she
opened
the
door
of
the
schoolmaster
room
the
bunk
against
the
wall
on
which
he
slept
was
empty
the
window
open
she
entered
closed
the
door
and
sat
down
by
the
open
window
the
moonlight
was
waning
the
silver
light
in
which
the
forest
had
been
bathed
an
hour
before
was
dimmer
the
shadows
the
house
and
sheds
cast
black
against
it
where
the
light
struck
dead
trees
they
stood
out
from
the
dark
wave
of
the
forest
listening
intently
she
heard
the
distant
cracking
of
whips
the
long
lowing
belched
and
terrified
cries
of
cattle
chapter
xxxii
when
mcnab
awakened
in
the
morning
he
realised
that
his
sleep
had
been
too
heavy
for
him
to
know
what
had
happened
during
the
night
and
that
much
might
have
occurred
while
he
was
snoring
farrel
found
him
snapping
and
biting
like
a
trapped
dingo
his
voice
rasped
his
inquisitive
suspicious
eyes
were
everywhere
but
the
schoolmaster
had
none
of
the
air
of
a
victorious
gamester
and
amiability
was
of
a
pattern
with
what
he
had
imagined
it
the
night
before
he
had
heard
davey
and
conal
ride
out
at
dawn
with
a
cracking
of
whips
and
yelping
of
dogs
to
wake
the
saints
that
seemed
to
negative
the
suggestion
that
they
had
been
out
all
night
they
were
going
to
muster
a
couple
of
hundred
of
maitland
cattle
in
some
paddocks
near
red
creek
he
remembered
the
schoolmaster
had
said
yet
by
the
cold
light
of
early
morning
he
had
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
having
been
tricked
what
with
the
girl
smiles
and
steve
grog
he
had
not
been
as
wide
awake
as
he
had
intended
to
be
he
knew
farrel
readiness
to
consider
the
school
proposition
irritated
him
it
had
been
a
pretext
his
only
anxiety
was
not
to
discuss
it
any
more
he
was
all
fret
and
fume
to
get
back
to
the
wirree
nothing
would
stay
him
when
he
was
up
in
his
there
was
none
of
the
complaisant
geniality
of
the
night
before
about
him
he
gathered
up
his
reins
with
a
sour
smile
at
the
little
group
assembled
on
verandah
and
drove
out
of
sight
at
a
jolting
the
boys
got
the
mob
steve
asked
anxiously
the
schoolmaster
took
off
his
hat
with
a
sigh
had
the
time
of
their
lives
he
exclaimed
it
was
a
big
mob
rolling
fat
deirdre
eyes
were
still
on
the
track
down
which
mcnab
had
gone
to
the
wirree
i
wo
say
deirdre
he
had
said
as
his
eyes
rested
on
her
for
a
moment
i
be
seein
you
again
soon
there
had
been
something
in
the
nature
of
a
promise
or
a
threat
in
his
eyes
there
was
no
time
to
fix
brands
the
schoolmaster
was
telling
steve
conal
running
these
with
a
couple
of
score
of
maitland
store
beasts
drafted
out
about
fifty
calves
clear
skins
and
a
couple
of
dozen
cows
put
them
into
the
narrow
valley
run
wants
to
do
some
branding
when
he
gets
back
i
thought
he
ought
to
let
them
go
with
the
scrubbers
turned
back
to
the
bush
but
he
would
have
it
says
he
can
take
them
along
branded
with
maitland
next
bunch
it
a
bit
risky
leavin
them
there
steve
glance
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
lying
to
the
westward
between
the
last
line
of
hills
that
shut
the
shanty
in
from
the
long
roll
of
inland
plains
it
a
bit
risky
he
repeated
but
conal
knows
his
business
it
be
all
right
i
suppose
there
nobody
goes
narrow
valley
way
but
cameron
men
and
they
not
likely
to
be
going
this
time
of
the
year
seeing
the
rains
are
due
conal
had
a
look
at
the
fences
when
he
was
up
a
couple
of
days
ago
did
he
though
fences
are
much
good
seen
a
wild
cow
fly
like
a
bird
when
she
wants
to
good
thing
conal
got
away
before
the
rains
dan
if
the
rivers
were
down
he
never
got
through
yes
said
the
schoolmaster
it
was
a
case
of
now
or
never
and
after
all
he
added
gravely
putting
his
arm
out
and
drawing
her
to
him
it
was
deirdre
saved
the
situation
but
i
would
have
you
do
what
you
did
again
dear
not
for
all
the
cattle
in
the
world
nor
all
the
money
in
it
she
clung
to
him
and
i
would
do
it
she
sobbed
breathlessly
chapter
xxxiii
it
was
nearly
two
months
before
conal
and
davey
were
back
in
the
wirree
again
they
rode
into
the
township
one
evening
when
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
purple
range
of
the
hills
and
making
a
rosy
mist
of
the
dust
a
mob
of
northern
cattle
raised
and
silent
their
whips
curled
on
their
arms
their
dogs
lean
and
limping
at
heel
they
passed
mcnab
they
might
have
been
any
of
a
dozen
who
were
about
the
that
day
but
mcnab
recognised
them
it
was
those
cattle
of
maitland
that
stood
between
him
and
his
suspicions
of
the
game
conal
and
the
schoolmaster
were
on
he
thought
he
knew
the
part
they
played
in
it
but
itched
for
a
straw
of
proof
he
hurried
to
the
doorway
and
stood
in
it
chewing
his
underlip
as
he
watched
the
weedy
beasts
and
their
drovers
trail
out
of
the
town
conal
saw
him
pullin
up
and
comin
back
for
a
drink
in
a
minute
mcnab
he
yelled
he
lost
no
chances
of
letting
thad
think
there
was
nothing
to
hide
in
his
movements
he
returned
to
the
black
bull
a
few
moments
later
and
davey
went
on
to
hegarty
teddy
steve
black
boy
and
the
dogs
watched
the
cattle
on
the
edge
of
the
road
conal
and
davey
spent
few
words
on
each
other
they
went
their
separate
ways
by
mutual
consent
avoiding
the
occasions
that
mean
association
or
talking
on
the
road
during
the
first
days
when
the
cattle
were
fresh
they
had
swung
their
keeping
the
mob
going
like
one
man
there
had
been
headlong
gallops
after
breakaways
the
of
stragglers
the
crowding
of
beasts
up
steep
slippery
hillsides
with
curses
and
yelping
dogs
the
watchfulness
that
driving
a
mob
of
wild
cattle
meant
nerves
and
muscles
were
stretched
to
the
job
in
hand
when
a
halt
was
made
the
first
night
the
mob
was
ringed
with
brushwood
fires
the
wildest
of
the
warrigals
broken
by
the
long
steady
trotting
hustled
up
quietly
against
maitland
store
beasts
conal
and
the
black
boy
took
the
first
watch
davey
and
conal
the
second
and
davey
and
the
black
the
third
ordinarily
the
fires
flaring
against
the
darkness
were
enough
to
keep
the
cattle
in
a
bunch
during
the
night
sometimes
when
a
fire
died
down
and
there
was
a
longer
gap
in
the
links
between
the
fires
a
restless
heifer
or
steer
made
a
dash
for
it
and
the
watcher
had
to
be
quick
with
a
burning
bough
brandish
and
whack
it
about
the
head
of
the
runaway
before
the
beast
with
a
moaning
bellow
and
roar
turned
back
to
the
mob
again
it
was
on
the
second
night
out
when
conal
was
sleeping
and
davey
and
teddy
watching
that
the
black
stupid
with
sleep
let
his
fires
go
down
and
a
red
bull
and
half
a
dozen
cows
broke
through
the
ring
it
looked
like
a
stampede
davey
dashed
after
the
bull
conal
dog
sally
alert
at
the
first
rush
of
the
cattle
movement
leapt
after
them
her
long
yellow
shape
flashed
like
a
streak
of
lightning
in
the
wan
light
over
the
plains
she
raced
level
with
the
leader
sleek
shoulder
and
laid
her
teeth
in
his
hide
wheeled
him
snapping
at
his
nose
and
dragging
him
by
it
until
he
turned
in
toward
the
mob
again
davey
lashed
the
cows
after
the
leader
sally
flew
round
them
a
yellow
fury
yelping
and
snapping
conal
flung
on
to
his
horse
and
laid
about
him
with
his
whip
cursing
he
and
the
black
boy
had
all
their
work
cut
out
to
keep
the
mob
steady
it
was
a
near
thing
and
conal
used
his
tongue
pretty
freely
when
he
talked
of
it
he
had
had
very
little
to
say
to
davey
ordinarily
the
memory
of
that
evening
in
the
kitchen
at
steve
rankled
it
bred
a
sense
of
resentment
and
secret
antagonism
which
he
took
less
pains
to
hide
from
that
night
he
used
his
lungs
to
curse
teddy
and
the
red
steer
but
did
not
talk
to
davey
unless
he
had
something
to
say
about
the
cattle
or
the
road
from
dawn
till
sunset
they
rode
silently
within
a
dozen
yards
of
each
other
when
they
came
within
easy
distance
of
rane
and
the
lake
settlements
they
kept
the
mob
moving
all
night
the
snowy
was
swollen
with
recent
rains
when
they
came
to
it
but
conal
had
set
his
mind
on
crossing
without
delay
he
rushed
the
mob
down
the
incline
to
the
river
and
drove
it
into
the
swirling
stream
whip
thongs
swung
together
ripped
and
racked
in
the
clear
air
the
struggling
terrified
beasts
were
crowded
with
no
more
than
their
heads
above
water
against
the
strong
currents
of
the
stream
until
with
rattling
and
clashing
horns
they
clambered
up
the
bank
on
the
further
side
the
last
days
on
the
road
were
taken
more
easily
the
mob
went
slowly
eastward
grazing
as
it
moved
and
was
in
prime
condition
when
conal
handed
it
over
to
maitland
in
cooburra
on
the
new
south
wales
side
maitland
was
a
big
man
in
the
district
head
of
the
firm
of
stock
dealers
no
difficulties
were
made
about
the
when
conal
had
had
some
talk
with
him
and
davey
and
he
had
loafed
about
the
town
for
a
day
or
two
they
went
out
again
with
half
a
hundred
poor
beasts
from
a
western
run
on
the
road
behind
the
mob
despite
their
secret
resentment
long
conal
and
davey
cameron
had
come
to
the
dumb
understanding
of
road
mates
it
did
nothing
to
break
the
silence
between
them
davey
yielded
conal
an
unconscious
homage
he
did
it
with
grudging
humility
but
there
was
no
breaking
the
barrier
of
conal
reserve
notwithstanding
his
blithe
recklessness
his
daring
and
bragging
enthusiasm
there
was
a
stern
quality
an
unplumbed
depth
in
conal
he
endured
davey
company
but
there
was
that
in
his
mind
against
him
which
one
man
does
not
easily
forgive
another
as
they
drew
nearer
wirreeford
and
the
thoughts
of
each
took
the
same
track
the
latent
animosity
vibrated
between
them
again
conal
lost
no
time
in
getting
out
of
the
township
and
taking
the
road
to
the
hills
davey
conscious
that
it
was
conal
and
not
he
who
would
stand
well
in
the
eyes
of
deirdre
and
the
schoolmaster
when
the
story
of
the
road
was
told
lingered
at
hegarty
a
brooding
bitterness
possessed
him
he
knew
that
conal
had
wanted
him
until
this
deal
was
fixed
up
not
only
because
he
was
short
of
a
man
when
pat
and
tim
kearney
cleared
out
but
because
he
was
afraid
how
he
davey
might
use
the
knowledge
he
had
told
the
schoolmaster
he
possessed
about
some
other
of
conal
cattle
dealings
as
for
himself
davey
knew
that
not
only
had
his
independence
demanded
a
job
but
something
of
the
spirit
of
adventure
a
recklessness
of
consequences
had
appealed
to
him
in
the
moonlighting
of
a
couple
of
hundred
scrub
cattle
he
wondered
what
he
would
do
when
the
schoolmaster
and
conal
and
deirdre
left
the
hills
he
knew
that
a
share
of
the
money
the
cattle
had
brought
would
be
his
he
thought
that
he
would
go
away
from
the
south
when
he
got
it
and
strike
out
in
some
new
line
of
life
for
himself
chapter
xxxiv
davey
was
on
his
way
to
steve
when
he
saw
that
the
wooden
church
with
a
zinc
roof
which
had
just
been
built
in
wirreeford
was
lighted
and
that
people
were
going
into
it
it
was
early
evening
the
sky
clear
above
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
building
a
few
stars
quivering
in
the
limpid
twilight
davey
pulled
up
his
horse
to
stare
at
the
church
the
place
had
been
building
a
long
while
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
up
and
finished
in
the
paddock
beside
it
was
his
father
and
the
grey
horse
beside
it
was
bessie
old
lass
daughter
a
vague
heart
pain
caught
his
breath
the
wind
brought
the
strain
of
a
plaintive
hymn
they
must
be
inside
his
mother
and
father
he
told
himself
he
got
off
his
horse
and
led
her
into
the
deep
shadow
the
paling
fence
threw
a
longing
to
see
them
seized
him
he
stood
there
trying
to
hear
their
voices
after
a
moment
he
thought
he
could
hear
his
mother
voice
frail
and
sweet
in
the
singing
he
remembered
how
she
had
sung
to
him
once
how
she
had
sung
over
her
spinning
wheel
and
the
quaint
little
song
it
was
the
tune
of
it
went
flying
through
his
brain
with
the
of
the
spinning
wheel
how
gay
and
dear
her
voice
had
been
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
love
as
a
child
to
sit
clutching
at
her
dress
when
she
sang
like
that
and
the
old
man
in
that
moment
of
loneliness
he
forgot
the
hard
speaking
and
bitterness
there
had
been
between
him
and
his
father
a
wave
of
tenderness
overwhelmed
him
pride
and
a
longing
for
their
love
struggled
in
him
with
a
physical
hurt
beyond
endurance
he
determined
to
stand
there
and
wait
to
see
them
come
out
of
church
friday
night
services
after
the
cattle
sales
were
an
institution
as
new
as
the
church
they
had
been
organised
so
that
christenings
marriages
and
some
into
the
bargain
might
be
done
while
the
hill
folk
were
down
for
the
sales
mcnab
had
done
his
best
to
move
the
parson
who
had
accepted
the
wirree
as
his
cure
of
souls
but
the
young
man
stuck
like
a
limpet
and
there
was
no
telling
the
gossips
said
how
moral
and
he
might
not
make
wirreeford
before
he
was
done
with
it
davey
waited
and
watched
when
the
people
came
filing
out
of
the
doorway
he
edged
along
the
fence
so
that
he
could
see
their
faces
as
they
passed
under
the
flare
of
an
over
the
door
there
were
not
many
of
them
two
or
three
women
and
children
and
an
old
man
or
two
they
gathered
and
were
talking
about
the
gateway
when
mary
cameron
came
out
davey
saw
her
face
under
the
light
for
a
moment
there
was
a
shine
of
tears
on
her
cheeks
her
figure
in
the
grey
dress
he
knew
so
well
seemed
thinner
than
it
used
to
be
her
little
straw
bonnet
was
pressed
down
close
on
her
head
her
shawl
drawn
over
her
shoulders
she
hurried
from
the
church
door
without
speaking
to
anyone
he
saw
her
hand
flutter
out
to
the
post
by
the
door
as
she
felt
for
the
step
she
been
crying
and
saying
her
prayers
for
me
he
told
himself
with
pain
and
he
waited
to
see
donald
cameron
come
from
the
church
and
join
her
a
girl
a
girl
detached
herself
from
the
little
gathering
about
the
gate
and
went
towards
her
oh
there
you
are
cameron
dear
she
said
i
was
waiting
to
help
you
put
bess
in
davey
knew
her
voice
it
was
jessie
ross
his
heart
gave
a
throb
of
gratitude
the
young
parson
came
out
and
slammed
the
church
door
behind
him
davey
glance
flew
to
the
paddock
he
could
see
his
mother
figure
moving
about
among
the
vehicles
and
the
horses
the
old
man
not
with
her
she
harnessing
up
herself
he
thought
where
is
he
i
wonder
she
would
have
come
down
alone
he
saw
the
heavy
buggy
his
mother
sitting
erect
in
it
go
out
along
the
road
he
followed
at
a
little
distance
the
buggy
halted
before
the
black
bull
a
dozen
horses
dogs
lying
limp
and
silent
at
their
heels
were
tethered
to
the
posts
before
it
the
bar
was
open
and
noisy
with
men
drinking
they
were
gathered
about
its
narrow
benches
like
flies
from
the
gaping
doors
a
garish
light
fell
but
it
was
out
of
range
of
the
light
that
mary
cameron
had
drawn
up
her
horse
she
sat
very
still
the
outlines
of
the
vehicle
were
ruled
black
against
the
starlight
which
rested
wanly
on
her
figure
and
on
the
sturdy
grey
horse
what
on
earth
is
she
waiting
for
davey
asked
himself
he
was
going
to
her
when
the
of
the
black
bull
the
door
of
mcnab
parlour
as
he
knew
opened
donald
cameron
stood
in
it
for
a
moment
davey
saw
mcnab
behind
him
his
crooked
figure
and
twisted
face
with
the
withered
fringe
of
hair
about
it
cameron
staggered
across
the
stretch
of
gravel
to
the
buggy
in
which
his
wife
sat
waiting
he
climbed
into
it
will
you
not
let
me
drive
donald
the
clear
sweetness
of
his
mother
voice
came
to
the
boy
ears
no
donald
cameron
said
unsteadily
there
no
woman
living
will
drive
me
while
i
can
lay
hands
on
the
reins
the
moved
away
over
the
long
winding
road
to
the
hills
davey
was
stupefied
so
mcnab
got
him
he
muttered
glancing
at
the
ramshackle
shanty
the
of
the
black
bull
with
red
eyes
on
its
dingy
white
ground
was
just
visible
the
glare
from
the
bar
lighted
it
that
why
she
goes
to
church
alone
the
old
man
drinking
he
thought
he
turned
to
look
after
the
buggy
it
was
bumping
and
jolting
over
the
ruts
and
barking
the
roadside
davey
held
his
breath
he
saw
the
mare
buck
and
then
take
the
log
culvert
over
the
creek
two
or
three
hundred
yards
from
mcnab
he
not
fit
to
drive
he
told
himself
and
swinging
into
his
saddle
set
off
down
the
road
he
turn
the
wheel
on
a
log
or
drive
off
the
road
she
knows
that
why
she
wanted
to
drive
he
followed
at
a
little
distance
all
the
way
through
the
hills
sometimes
he
heard
his
mother
voice
patient
and
yet
edged
with
a
weariness
and
despair
exclaiming
mind
there
a
bad
rut
to
the
left
or
you
driving
too
near
the
edge
of
the
road
donald
but
steadily
without
reference
to
either
of
them
the
little
horse
kept
to
the
track
davey
followed
them
all
the
way
home
to
the
very
gates
of
the
house
in
which
he
was
born
then
he
turned
back
into
the
shade
of
the
trees
again
once
his
mother
had
looked
round
and
seen
the
watchful
horseman
she
had
not
been
near
enough
to
see
his
face
he
rode
in
the
shadows
but
he
had
seen
her
face
and
it
was
a
revelation
to
him
a
woman
must
have
a
good
deal
of
courage
to
drive
beside
a
drunken
man
in
the
hills
at
night
he
knew
the
look
on
her
face
hurt
him
there
were
death
gaps
at
a
dozen
places
on
the
road
and
donald
cameron
was
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
neither
the
mare
nor
his
wife
could
have
saved
him
if
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
drive
in
any
given
direction
davey
wondered
how
often
his
mother
had
driven
like
this
before
he
vowed
that
she
would
never
do
it
again
if
he
could
help
it
chapter
xxxv
after
the
sales
on
the
following
friday
when
the
dust
of
the
yards
was
heavy
in
the
air
and
the
stock
horses
stood
in
irregular
drooping
lines
outside
the
black
bull
and
mary
ann
hegarty
davey
made
his
way
to
where
on
an
open
space
of
land
the
church
had
been
built
wirreeford
had
out
its
lights
garish
oil
flares
and
rush
candles
and
the
little
fires
lighted
before
the
doors
of
the
houses
to
keep
off
sand
flies
and
mosquitoes
smouldered
in
the
dusk
sending
up
wreaths
of
blue
smoke
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
during
the
week
conal
had
been
mustering
and
branding
the
cows
and
calves
drafted
from
the
scrub
mob
davey
had
worked
with
him
and
many
of
the
calves
he
had
scarred
with
maitland
double
were
the
progeny
of
his
cattle
half
a
dozen
cows
bore
the
brand
under
their
thick
hair
conal
had
wanted
to
pay
him
off
he
had
told
davey
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
burn
his
fingers
with
this
business
and
that
he
could
run
the
mob
to
the
border
or
to
melbourne
across
the
swamp
if
the
rivers
were
down
but
he
was
davey
knew
a
sense
of
obligation
urged
him
to
stick
to
conal
until
the
whole
of
the
mob
they
had
moonlighted
together
was
disposed
of
conal
had
insisted
on
getting
the
cows
and
calves
into
a
paddock
below
steve
the
day
before
and
had
run
a
hundred
of
maitland
fattened
beasts
with
them
he
meant
to
make
a
start
and
have
the
mob
on
the
roads
early
next
morning
there
was
a
in
the
long
paddock
behind
mcnab
that
friday
conal
and
he
had
come
into
the
wirree
to
show
themselves
before
starting
off
on
their
overland
journey
almost
every
man
in
the
countryside
was
there
davey
wondered
why
the
schoolmaster
had
not
come
down
to
the
township
with
conal
and
himself
he
had
been
a
different
man
since
their
return
very
silent
scarcely
stirring
from
his
chair
in
the
back
room
while
deirdre
hovered
never
very
far
from
him
anxious
and
protective
as
a
she
had
not
told
him
what
had
happened
while
conal
and
he
were
away
how
the
schoolmaster
had
said
to
her
one
day
suddenly
it
very
dark
deirdre
is
there
going
to
be
a
storm
the
sunshine
was
blank
and
golden
out
of
doors
no
she
had
said
laughing
there
not
a
sign
of
one
where
are
you
he
asked
his
voice
strange
and
strained
why
i
here
just
beside
you
she
replied
he
put
out
his
hands
i
ca
see
you
he
said
it
the
dark
deirdre
my
god
it
the
dark
for
a
long
time
he
had
sat
staring
while
she
knelt
beside
him
crying
murmuring
eagerly
and
tenderly
trying
to
soothe
and
to
comfort
him
but
from
that
time
the
dimming
and
obliterating
of
the
whole
world
had
begun
for
him
the
heavy
darkness
had
passed
it
was
not
all
night
yet
but
a
misty
twilight
he
had
forbidden
her
to
speak
of
it
so
that
davey
did
not
know
conal
and
steve
had
guessed
but
davey
mind
busy
with
its
own
problems
was
slower
to
realise
what
was
going
on
about
him
it
had
roused
every
loyal
and
fighting
instinct
in
him
to
see
his
mother
with
that
look
of
suffering
on
her
face
his
father
in
the
way
of
becoming
mcnab
prey
losing
all
that
he
had
gained
through
years
of
toil
and
harsh
integrity
by
falling
into
the
pigs
trough
mcnab
had
set
for
him
it
was
that
stern
righteousness
of
his
his
sober
stolid
virtue
which
had
given
cameron
the
place
in
the
respect
and
grudging
homage
of
the
countryside
that
his
wealth
and
property
alone
would
not
have
won
for
him
they
had
cloaked
even
his
meanness
with
a
sombre
dignity
and
brought
him
the
title
of
the
laird
of
ayrmuir
davey
led
his
horse
into
the
paddock
beside
the
church
where
the
vehicles
which
had
brought
the
hill
folk
to
the
township
were
standing
the
horses
out
of
the
shafts
their
heavy
harness
still
on
their
backs
were
feeding
tethered
to
the
fence
or
to
the
wheels
of
the
carts
and
buggies
he
stood
beside
the
high
buggy
that
had
brought
mary
and
donald
cameron
to
wirreeford
he
rubbed
his
hand
along
bessie
long
of
a
nose
and
told
her
on
a
drifting
stream
of
thought
that
he
had
decided
to
go
home
to
ask
his
father
to
forgive
him
and
that
he
meant
to
try
to
get
on
with
him
again
her
attitude
of
attention
and
affection
comforted
him
the
people
began
to
come
from
the
church
they
stood
in
groups
by
the
doorway
talking
to
each
other
one
or
two
men
came
into
the
paddock
to
for
the
home
journey
davey
put
the
mare
into
her
shafts
he
was
fastening
the
traces
when
mary
cameron
came
round
the
back
of
the
buggy
a
catch
of
her
breath
told
that
she
had
seen
him
davey
she
cried
he
saw
her
face
the
light
of
her
eyes
mother
he
sobbed
his
arms
went
round
her
and
his
face
with
the
rough
beard
such
a
face
it
had
become
since
it
last
brushed
her
was
crushed
against
her
cheek
i
coming
home
he
said
his
voice
breaking
not
now
not
but
in
a
little
while
i
ask
the
old
man
to
forgive
me
and
see
if
we
ca
get
along
better
davey
davey
she
cried
softly
looking
into
his
face
a
new
joy
in
her
own
oh
but
they
are
sad
days
these
have
you
heard
what
they
are
saying
of
your
father
they
tell
me
that
you
have
been
over
the
ranges
yes
davey
said
she
scarcely
recognised
his
voice
it
because
of
father
because
of
what
they
saying
i
coming
home
i
wo
have
them
say
it
after
all
he
done
do
you
think
i
going
to
let
him
lose
it
if
i
can
help
it
there
was
a
passionate
vibration
in
his
voice
how
did
it
happen
i
saw
you
on
friday
and
followed
you
home
oh
my
boy
her
hand
trembled
on
his
shoulders
it
was
you
then
what
come
to
your
father
i
do
know
at
all
he
not
the
same
man
he
used
to
be
it
that
man
at
the
black
bull
he
got
hold
of
him
i
do
know
how
but
he
been
drinking
there
often
now
and
he
never
used
to
be
a
drinking
man
your
father
i
think
it
was
his
disappointment
with
you
at
first
i
not
blaming
you
davey
it
was
to
be
expected
you
do
anything
but
what
you
did
i
not
blaming
you
but
there
were
the
long
evenings
by
ourselves
after
gone
he
sat
eating
his
heart
out
about
it
before
the
fire
and
i
could
say
a
word
he
was
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
but
his
pride
would
let
him
speak
he
was
seeing
the
ruin
of
his
hopes
for
you
he
meant
you
to
be
a
great
man
in
the
district
then
mcnab
began
talking
to
him
your
father
thinks
mcnab
doing
him
a
good
turn
in
some
way
but
i
feel
it
nothing
but
evil
will
come
to
us
from
him
the
sight
of
the
man
makes
me
shiver
and
i
wonder
what
harm
it
is
he
is
planning
for
us
her
voice
went
to
davey
heart
i
know
mother
he
said
but
it
be
all
right
soon
the
old
pull
up
when
i
come
home
i
tell
him
i
mean
to
be
all
he
wants
me
to
be
i
was
a
fool
before
though
i
do
think
i
could
go
on
in
the
old
way
even
now
but
he
be
reasonable
if
i
go
the
right
way
about
asking
him
i
a
deal
more
sense
than
i
had
i
sobered
down
a
lot
can
see
things
straighter
i
wo
be
having
any
dealings
with
mcnab
again
and
i
get
father
to
cut
him
the
pair
of
us
be
more
than
equal
to
him
but
i
got
to
finish
my
job
with
conal
first
it
would
be
playing
the
game
to
leave
him
just
now
is
it
conal
you
been
working
with
davey
her
eyes
went
up
to
his
anxiously
yes
he
said
your
father
been
talking
a
lot
about
this
work
of
conal
she
went
on
a
troubled
line
in
her
forehead
he
says
the
schoolmaster
in
it
too
mcnab
been
talking
to
him
about
it
and
they
mean
to
interfere
in
some
way
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
it
when
he
did
know
he
was
talking
driving
home
in
the
evenings
but
mcnab
making
a
fool
of
him
for
his
own
purposes
and
to
do
harm
to
farrel
i
think
i
was
trying
to
tell
your
father
that
but
he
would
hear
me
oh
why
have
you
got
yourself
mixed
up
with
duffing
and
crooked
ways
davey
what
did
he
say
davey
asked
i
do
remember
all
of
it
she
swept
her
brow
with
a
little
weary
gesture
it
was
all
mumbling
and
muttering
and
i
could
hear
half
what
he
said
but
it
was
to
do
with
cattle
and
mcnab
came
over
to
the
yards
as
soon
as
we
arrived
and
i
heard
him
say
got
word
where
there
a
mob
with
brands
wo
bear
lookin
into
tell
and
he
get
a
couple
of
men
to
work
with
him
if
you
come
round
to
the
parlour
we
can
fix
up
what
to
be
done
davey
jerked
his
horse
bridle
pulling
him
round
to
mount
i
meant
to
take
you
home
myself
mother

said
but
have
to
find
conal
and
tell
him

davey
she
said
tremulously
i
go
and
wait
for
your
father
at
mcnab
he
there
now
and
we
quite
safe
with
bess
taking
us
home
she
knows
every
inch
of
the
way
davey
kissed
her
hurriedly
he
turned
out
of
the
church
paddock
towards
hegarty
there
was
a
dance
in
full
swing
and
he
thought
that
conal
might
be
there
but
although
a
new
fiddler
was
in
his
element
and
most
of
the
young
people
in
the
district
jigging
conal
was
not
he
went
back
along
the
road
to
mcnab
outside
in
the
buggy
mary
cameron
was
sitting
she
turned
and
smiled
when
he
rode
up
to
her
her
face
had
a
shy
happiness
but
the
patience
and
humility
of
her
waiting
attitude
infuriated
him
he
swung
off
his
horse
and
opened
the
door
of
mcnab
side
parlour
cameron
was
sitting
at
the
small
uneven
table
a
bottle
of
rum
and
glasses
before
him
mcnab
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
leaning
across
it
was
talking
to
him
his
voice
running
glibly
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp
on
the
table
between
them
showed
his
yellow
eager
eyes
the
scheming
intensity
of
the
brain
behind
them
the
lurking
of
triumph
about
his
writhing
colourless
lips
leaning
lazily
back
in
his
chair
his
long
legs
stretched
under
the
table
sat
watching
and
listening
to
him
mcnab
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
oath
when
he
saw
davey
in
the
doorway
mother
waiting
for
you
outside
he
said
lifting
donald
cameron
by
the
elbows
and
leading
him
to
the
door
he
turned
on
mcnab
with
his
back
to
it
i
be
looking
after
my
father
affairs
from
this
out
he
said
and
you
remember
what
i
promised
you
if
you
interfered
with
me
again
you
get
it
sure
as
i
live
he
slammed
the
door
donald
cameron
stupid
with
mcnab
heavy
spirits
was
unprepared
for
this
masterful
young
man
whose
rage
was
burning
to
a
white
heat
he
went
with
him
as
quietly
as
as
a
child
davey
helped
him
into
the
buggy
keep
him
away
from
mcnab
he
said
to
his
mother
and
i
be
home
as
soon
as
i
can
she
smiled
the
shy
happy
smile
of
a
girl
nodded
to
him
and
they
drove
off
davey
went
back
into
the
bar
of
the
black
bull
with
its
crowd
of
stockmen
drovers
and
loungers
where
conal
he
asked
does
anybody
know
if
he
left
the
town
yet
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
he
was
looking
for
you
an
hour
ago
davey
a
drunken
youngster
yelled
gaily
was
in
here
mcnab
gave
him
a
turn
about
the
girl
mcnab
was
tellin
him
you
to
marry
her
you
should
have
heard
conal
go
off
somebody
shouted
where
is
he
there
was
a
sharpness
about
young
davey
question
that
nobody
liked
who
mcnab
no
conal
mcnab
had
come
into
the
bar
and
was
standing
watching
him
his
face
livid
round
somewhere
lookin
for
your
blood
the
same
jovial
youngster
who
had
first
spoken
cried
seen
him
go
up
towards
the
store
a
while
ago
davey
salt
watson
said
slowly
no
one
smelt
mischief
brewing
quicker
than
he
he
had
seen
mcnab
face
he
knew
young
davey
temper
and
the
sort
of
man
he
was
growing
he
knew
conal
too
and
that
no
love
was
lost
between
them
it
was
an
urgent
matter
would
send
davey
looking
through
the
town
for
conal
that
way
he
guessed
and
knowing
something
of
the
business
they
had
in
hand
as
an
old
roadster
always
does
imagined
the
cause
of
the
urgency
mcnab
looked
as
if
davey
anxiety
to
find
conal
had
taught
him
something
too
davey
flung
out
of
the
bar
he
straddled
his
horse
again
and
went
flying
off
down
the
road
to
the
store
conal
was
not
there
someone
said
he
had
been
and
set
out
for
the
hills
an
hour
earlier
davey
made
off
down
the
road
again
doubling
on
his
track
past
the
black
bull
he
thought
that
he
would
catch
up
to
conal
on
the
road
and
that
they
would
be
back
at
steve
before
and
his
men
were
out
of
wirreeford
the
culvert
over
the
creek
that
he
had
watched
bess
shy
at
and
take
in
her
own
leisurely
fashion
a
week
before
was
not
half
a
mile
from
the
outskirts
of
the
township
the
creek
banks
on
either
side
were
fringed
i
with
wattles
and
as
the
mare
rattled
across
it
there
was
a
whistling
crack
in
the
air
davey
pitched
on
her
neck
terrified
she
leapt
forward
he
clung
to
her
swaying
for
a
while
yet
never
losing
his
grip
he
knew
that
someone
had
shot
him
from
the
trees
by
the
culvert
there
was
a
sharp
pain
in
his
breast
blood
welled
from
it
chapter
xxxvi
the
little
red
horse
pace
was
as
swift
as
a
swallow
she
flashed
on
over
the
long
winding
roads
up
the
steep
hillsides
and
down
them
slipping
and
sliding
on
the
loose
shingles
but
keeping
her
knees
in
the
cunning
way
that
only
the
mountain
horses
know
davey
heard
the
beat
of
her
hoofs
until
the
sound
became
mechanical
though
she
was
moving
she
seemed
to
get
no
further
to
throw
no
distance
behind
her
forging
ahead
through
the
darkness
fear
and
a
suffocating
weakness
began
to
dull
his
brain
he
could
not
see
the
sagging
pain
in
his
breast
ate
up
his
strength
with
a
desperate
effort
he
pulled
the
handkerchief
from
his
throat
and
thrust
it
inside
his
shirt
against
the
wound
he
dug
his
heels
into
red
side
urging
her
on
a
diffused
glow
of
lights
loomed
before
him
as
if
wakening
from
a
nightmare
in
which
he
had
been
struggling
to
get
forward
and
was
held
back
by
mysterious
unknown
forces
he
realised
that
they
were
the
lights
of
the
shanty
the
mare
carried
him
on
into
the
stable
yard
the
welcome
yelp
of
dogs
greeted
his
ears
he
flung
off
her
staggered
across
the
yard
and
burst
open
the
back
door
he
was
conscious
of
farrel
and
deirdre
springing
towards
him
of
steve
behind
them
then
surging
darkness
the
swirling
tides
of
dreamless
darkness
that
had
been
pressing
close
to
him
all
the
way
closed
over
him
for
a
moment
he
struggled
against
them
trying
to
speak
a
few
muttered
incoherent
words
were
all
deirdre
and
the
schoolmaster
caught
he
pitched
forward
deirdre
ran
to
him
the
schoolmaster
helped
her
to
lift
davey
over
on
his
back
she
moistened
his
lips
with
the
spirit
that
steve
brought
quickly
there
blood
on
him
father
she
cried
there
was
no
tremor
in
her
voice
only
a
tense
anxiety
farrel
told
her
what
to
do
to
cut
away
davey
shirt
where
the
blood
oozed
on
it
steve
went
for
water
and
rags
as
she
did
so
the
flickering
light
of
the
candle
the
schoolmaster
held
showed
the
broken
and
blackened
flesh
he
been
shot
it
a
slug
made
that
mark
steve
gasped
when
he
saw
it
when
he
had
put
a
basin
of
cold
water
beside
her
she
laid
soaked
rags
on
the
wound
the
shock
brought
davey
a
moment
of
consciousness
he
moaned
stirring
with
pain
his
eyes
opened
he
saw
deirdre
face
above
his
and
the
schoolmaster
bending
over
him
he
stared
at
them
unseeingly
then
the
mists
cleared
from
his
brain
i
all
right
he
muttered
all
right
he
lay
quite
still
have
you
got
the
calves
out
of
the
paddock
he
asked
a
moment
later
his
voice
stronger
and
a
couple
of
men
be
here
presently
mcnab
got
wind
of
their
being
in
the
paddock
here
get
them
out
to
the
valley
quick
or
let
them
go
where
conal
steve
asked
eagerly
he
ought
to
be
in
by
now
there
was
a
crooked
furrow
of
pain
on
davey
face
i
looked
for
him
before
i
came
out
he
said
could
find
him
thought
he
must
have
gone
on
ahead
i
got
this
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
crossing
the
culvert
over
the
creek
they
said
at
mcnab
conal
had
been
swearing
to
do
for
me
but
i
did
believe
it
his
body
sagged
and
his
head
went
back
but
deirdre
was
behind
him
she
rested
his
head
on
her
knees
her
eyes
flew
to
the
schoolmaster
it
was
conal
she
breathed
he
said
he
would
do
it
farrel
face
whitened
he
put
no
man
before
long
conal
deirdre
put
a
pack
of
wet
rags
over
the
wound
again
and
bound
it
on
with
a
piece
of
unbleached
linen
her
eyes
went
anxiously
to
steve
he
not
going
to
die
is
he
she
asked
no
steve
muttered
cheerfully
his
eyes
travelled
the
length
of
the
boy
sturdy
frame
it
not
much
more
than
a
surface
wound
though
it
cut
up
the
flesh
a
good
deal
he
look
different
if
he
was
to
kick
the
bucket
if
we
could
lift
him
into
the
other
room
it
would
be
better
she
suggested
the
men
from
the
wirree
may
be
coming
yes
the
schoolmaster
said
as
they
tried
to
move
him
davey
regained
consciousness
have
you
got
those
beasts
out
he
asked
querulously
there
no
time
to
lose
i
all
right
deirdre
on
one
side
the
schoolmaster
on
the
other
they
led
him
to
the
room
in
which
farrel
slept
he
sank
wearily
on
the
bunk
against
the
wall
the
schoolmaster
went
back
to
the
kitchen
for
a
moment
deirdre
bent
over
the
bunk
gazing
at
davey
still
face
anxiously
intently
it
was
no
time
for
weeping
or
exclamation
she
realised
the
danger
that
threatened
if
and
the
men
from
the
wirree
came
and
found
the
cattle
in
the
paddock
below
steve
not
only
davey
but
also
the
schoolmaster
would
have
to
pay
the
penalty
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
he
sleeping
she
said
the
schoolmaster
and
steve
were
standing
by
the
door
arguing
in
an
undertone
together
the
schoolmaster
turned
to
go
out
where
are
you
going
she
asked
let
those
animals
out
he
said
briefly
it
no
good
teddy
wo
go
with
them
alone
he
as
afraid
of
the
dark
as
they
are
and
if
coming
we
got
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
he
going
to
try
and
take
them
himself
to
the
valley
and
madness
he
ca
see
cried
steve
conal
was
a
fool
to
bring
them
near
the
place
i
told
him
this
morning
but
he
take
his
own
way
and
nobody
else
the
schoolmaster
replied
if
he
were
here
now
i
going
to
take
them
father
deirdre
said
they
easy
enough
to
drive
at
night
and
teddy
work
with
me
you
watch
davey
he
be
right
now
but
in
case
besides
the
place
has
got
to
look
peaceable
and
ordinary
if
comes
i
ca
let
you
do
it
deirdre
the
schoolmaster
voice
was
harsh
and
peremptory
i
going
to
he
recognised
his
own
spirit
in
her
there
no
time
to
lose
she
said
and
i
know
the
track
to
the
valley
conal
showed
it
to
me
i
helped
him
to
bring
in
the
calves
yesterday
and
i
have
been
on
the
roads
with
you
both
for
the
last
year
without
knowing
how
to
manage
a
handful
of
old
cows
i
tell
you
i
not
have
it
the
schoolmaster
interrupted
passionately
it
means
as
much
to
me
as
to
any
of
you
she
said
a
little
breathless
sob
in
her
voice
you
do
know
how
much
you
ca
have
these
beasts
with
the
new
brands
running
the
hills
now
conal
ought
to
be
responsible
for
them
but
that
wo
help
us
much
if
they
found
here
known
to
have
been
working
with
him
and
you
were
suspected
of
being
with
him
even
when
you
were
the
door
slammed
behind
her
steve
followed
her
out
of
doors
he
pulled
the
chestnut
girths
when
she
had
thrown
a
saddle
across
his
back
you
can
manage
the
calves
of
course
deirdre
he
said
keep
quiet
as
you
can
no
shouting
mind
the
dogs
know
night
work
with
mostly
quiet
work
keep
back
you
not
be
raising
a
whip
yourself
i
tell
teddy
the
less
crackin
the
better
these
beasts
go
quiet
enough
he
and
the
schoolmaster
watched
her
flying
out
across
the
faintly
moonlit
paddocks
the
dogs
were
soon
working
round
the
mob
in
a
far
corner
where
the
fence
panels
were
down
deirdre
drove
them
through
the
opening
the
black
boy
was
on
the
road
waiting
to
keep
the
beasts
noses
northwards
with
an
adroit
flick
of
his
whip
it
was
with
an
occasional
lowing
and
rattling
of
horns
the
brush
and
rattle
of
hoofs
on
the
dry
timber
that
they
passed
out
into
the
shadows
of
the
road
the
schoolmaster
had
no
fear
that
deirdre
could
not
manage
this
handful
of
yearlings
and
old
cows
she
had
chased
calves
from
paddock
to
paddock
when
she
was
big
enough
to
straddle
a
pony
and
had
cracked
a
light
whip
which
conal
had
made
for
her
with
a
fall
a
couple
of
inches
shorter
than
his
own
round
many
a
restless
herd
when
conal
and
he
were
droving
and
she
was
on
the
roads
with
them
it
was
the
bitterness
of
not
being
able
to
drive
himself
that
plagued
farrel
the
consciousness
of
having
to
stand
by
and
let
her
do
what
there
was
danger
in
doing
incensed
him
steve
watched
the
road
for
sound
or
sign
of
men
and
horses
from
wirreeford
then
he
chased
his
own
two
milkers
up
from
the
cow
paddock
and
ran
them
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
road
where
the
mob
had
passed
to
obliterate
its
tracks
a
weight
was
off
the
schoolmaster
mind
when
steve
said
that
deirdre
and
the
black
were
out
of
sight
he
knew
that
by
taking
the
cattle
along
the
narrow
tracks
on
the
ledges
of
the
hills
she
would
save
them
narrow
valley
scrubs
would
screen
them
from
curious
eyes
if
came
the
road
would
tell
no
tales
steve
cows
had
made
it
look
as
if
a
mob
had
passed
in
the
opposite
direction
beyond
the
shanty
and
he
and
the
schoolmaster
had
a
story
to
fit
the
tracks
they
did
not
think
that
anybody
but
themselves
knew
the
way
under
the
trees
on
the
valley
hillsides
only
if
brought
a
tracker
would
he
be
able
to
follow
deirdre
farrel
wondered
how
word
had
reached
mcnab
and
what
foolhardiness
had
led
conal
to
bring
these
branded
calves
to
the
paddock
below
steve
for
a
moment
the
idea
that
conal
baited
and
maddened
with
drink
might
have
given
some
hint
at
mcnab
of
the
beasts
being
in
steve
paddock
occurred
to
him
and
then
there
was
davey
for
a
while
his
mind
brooded
over
what
had
happened
to
him
it
was
only
mad
with
drink
conal
could
have
shot
at
a
man
in
the
dark
he
told
himself
the
open
fight
is
his
way
conal
and
he
had
been
friends
a
good
many
years
and
there
was
something
in
his
estimate
of
the
man
which
defied
the
idea
that
he
had
shot
davey
and
yet
it
looked
as
if
he
had
why
was
he
not
in
he
had
left
wirreeford
an
hour
before
davey
conal
was
on
the
road
before
davey
and
he
had
been
drinking
at
mcnab
he
had
been
taunted
with
deirdre
name
it
was
only
mad
with
drink
he
could
have
done
it
the
schoolmaster
told
himself
again
and
even
then
a
fierce
contempt
and
condemnation
surged
within
him
the
memory
of
deirdre
fired
young
womanhood
of
the
look
in
her
face
of
the
glow
in
her
eyes
told
him
what
this
hurt
to
davey
meant
to
her
steve
watched
in
the
room
beside
davey
his
shrunken
crippled
limbs
ached
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
he
drooped
and
slept
forgetfully
the
schoolmaster
strode
the
length
of
the
kitchen
the
fire
smouldered
low
he
threw
some
wood
on
it
the
crackling
flames
flashed
and
played
freakishly
across
the
room
he
wondered
if
conal
would
come
where
he
was
the
hours
passed
there
was
no
sound
or
sign
of
late
riders
from
the
wirree
he
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
the
night
was
very
still
only
a
mopoke
called
plaintively
in
the
distance
there
was
a
stir
in
the
room
in
which
davey
was
sleeping
farrel
heard
steve
voice
in
startled
and
sleepy
protest
the
door
opened
davey
stood
on
the
threshold
his
eyes
with
a
delirious
brightness
in
them
what
have
you
done
about
those
calves
he
asked
his
voice
quick
and
clear
we
are
going
to
let
go
steve
gasped
you
go
back
and
lie
down
now
davey
you
ca
do
that
with
the
new
brands
on
them
davey
brushed
him
aside
irritably
i
all
right
now
i
can
take
them
to
the
valley
it
a
bit
of
luck
has
turned
up
yet
i
upset
his
calculations
his
and
mcnab
he
not
so
fond
of
gettin
a
move
on
johnny
mac
might
guessed
i
got
a
notion
he
was
going
to
be
busy
when
i
went
round
asking
for
conal
thought
we
give
him
the
slip
anyway
and
he
save
himself
the
trouble
of
coming
he
laughed
a
little
unsteadily
think
i
get
the
calves
along
to
the
valley
all
the
same
the
schoolmaster
took
his
arm
go
and
lie
down
davey
he
said
if
you
go
wandering
about
like
this
you
bring
on
the
bleeding
again
besides
deirdre
where
is
she
his
eyes
flew
searching
the
room
for
her
she
it
seemed
difficult
to
say
she
has
gone
down
to
the
valley
so
it
be
all
right
he
said
davey
turned
towards
the
door
do
be
a
fool
davey
the
schoolmaster
intercepted
him
davey
pushed
him
aside
he
strode
into
the
stable
yard
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
disable
him
a
moment
later
the
schoolmaster
heard
the
rattle
of
hoofs
on
the
road
every
fibre
of
him
shivered
at
the
boy
contempt
the
blazing
amazement
of
his
eyes
he
sank
into
a
chair
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
chapter
xxxvii
deirdre
and
the
black
boy
drove
their
straggling
herd
into
the
stockyard
in
the
narrow
bush
clearing
walled
by
trees
an
hour
or
two
before
dawn
the
which
conal
had
put
up
at
the
end
of
narrow
valley
were
invisible
to
any
but
those
who
knew
the
winding
track
that
led
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
through
the
heavy
timber
on
the
spur
to
the
old
hut
at
the
foot
of
it
teddy
was
pulling
the
rails
of
the
into
place
and
deirdre
was
going
towards
the
hut
socks
at
her
heels
his
bridle
over
her
arm
when
a
horseman
rode
out
of
the
opening
into
the
valley
by
which
they
had
come
she
recognised
the
red
horse
but
did
not
know
that
it
was
davey
riding
till
he
was
almost
level
and
dropped
to
his
feet
he
swayed
against
the
horse
side
clutching
his
reins
it
a
shame
no
one
to
bring
the
brutes
but
you
he
said
weakly
i
came
soon
as
i
knew
deirdre
put
her
arm
out
to
him
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
hut
davey
became
weaker
she
drew
the
horses
by
their
reins
behind
them
keeping
her
eyes
on
him
the
ground
rocked
under
his
feet
we
just
there
another
minute
and
it
be
all
right
she
said
and
called
teddy
he
had
seen
davey
cameron
red
horse
coming
into
the
clearing
and
ran
up
to
her
chattering
with
fright
at
the
sight
of
davey
limp
figure
put
the
horses
up
in
the
shed
leave
the
saddles
on
she
said
quickly
you
go
back
tell
boss
cows
all
right
davey
very
sick
man
here
although
an
hour
earlier
nothing
would
have
induced
the
boy
to
brave
the
darkness
alone
it
was
not
many
moments
before
he
was
up
on
his
weedy
nag
and
streaking
away
towards
the
cover
of
the
trees
and
the
threadlike
track
which
wound
uphill
along
the
spur
deirdre
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
davey
took
a
step
or
two
into
it
and
fell
forward
she
set
the
brushwood
on
the
hearth
alight
and
threw
some
broken
branches
over
it
to
make
a
blaze
there
was
no
stir
in
davey
when
she
knelt
beside
him
and
a
pool
of
blood
lay
on
the
floor
where
he
had
fallen
she
ran
out
of
doors
for
water
in
the
of
the
hut
it
was
difficult
to
find
anything
to
put
water
in
but
there
was
a
pannikin
near
the
water
barrel
and
she
filled
that
and
tore
pieces
of
calico
from
her
petticoat
to
bathe
his
wound
groping
along
the
shelves
near
the
fireplace
she
found
the
end
of
a
thick
rush
and
tallow
candle
she
did
not
light
it
at
first
because
the
fire
had
sprung
up
and
was
lighting
the
room
showing
its
meagre
equipment
the
branding
irons
and
a
saddle
flung
down
in
a
corner
a
bunk
against
the
wall
with
a
couple
of
sheepskins
over
it
a
table
with
two
or
three
pannikins
and
a
black
bottle
on
it
there
was
a
drain
of
some
spirit
in
the
bottle
she
poured
it
carefully
into
a
pannikin
and
held
it
to
davey
lips
his
immobility
frightened
her
she
lit
the
candle
and
held
it
close
to
his
face
under
the
leaping
yellow
flames
it
had
the
stillness
and
pallor
of
death
davey
davey
she
screamed
with
terror
creeping
up
beside
his
heavy
still
body
oh
you
must
die
davey
you
must
even
as
she
sobbed
she
thought
he
was
dead
she
put
the
spirit
on
his
lips
again
oh
i
done
all
that
i
can
all
that
i
know
to
do
wo
you
look
at
me
davey
my
heart
breaking
you
not
gone
davey
you
leave
me
it
me
deirdre
your
sweetheart
that
with
you
wo
you
look
at
me
wo
you
open
your
eyes
i
ca
bear
it
if
you
speak
to
me
davey
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
shaking
him
roughly
i
let
you
go
i
wo
let
you
die
she
cried
he
fell
back
from
her
hands
she
threw
herself
across
him
sobbing
brokenly
pressing
her
face
close
to
his
she
leant
over
him
murmuring
and
trying
to
revive
him
with
a
breathless
agony
of
grief
and
tenderness
oh
come
back
to
me
oh
you
will
not
die
you
will
not
die
and
leave
me
she
moaned
deirdre
that
loves
you
your
sweetheart
davey
the
cry
died
away
in
her
frenzy
she
had
not
heard
the
door
open
spent
with
anguish
she
laid
her
head
against
davey
still
one
she
felt
rather
than
saw
that
someone
was
there
in
the
hut
behind
her
she
turned
conal
was
standing
in
the
doorway
she
stared
at
him
he
might
have
been
an
aparition
so
strange
he
looked
there
in
the
doorway
with
the
glimmering
night
behind
him
there
was
something
stricken
aghast
about
him
he
gazed
at
her
as
if
the
tragic
woe
of
her
face
were
a
revelation
to
him
he
dead
and
it
you
that
have
killed
him
conal
she
said
at
length
you
love
him
deirdre
conal
asked
so
slow
and
dreary
their
voices
were
that
they
seemed
to
be
talking
in
their
sleep
yes
she
said
and
it
my
heart
that
dead
with
him
i
did
know
you
felt
like
that
about
him
deirdre
conal
said
a
humble
awkward
air
about
him
that
it
was
davey
lay
there
dead
did
not
seem
to
trouble
him
it
was
of
deirdre
he
was
thinking
in
a
mazed
dazed
way
and
the
thing
she
had
said
to
him
you
done
what
no
woman
could
forgive
you
conal
a
vibrating
passion
had
come
to
her
voice
i
never
want
to
see
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
conal
stared
at
her
a
moment
then
he
swung
heavily
out
of
the
hut
into
the
yard
he
had
the
gait
of
a
drunken
man
she
heard
him
stumble
over
something
in
the
yard
strike
his
head
against
a
post
then
the
sound
of
his
horse
in
the
clearing
died
away
deirdre
looked
down
at
the
still
figure
beside
her
in
spite
of
what
she
had
said
she
could
not
believe
that
davey
was
dead
that
all
that
young
strong
body
would
not
move
again
that
davey
eyes
would
not
open
and
look
at
her
with
the
eager
questioning
glance
she
had
known
something
of
the
horror
of
his
stillness
had
passed
she
moistened
his
lips
with
the
spirit
putting
her
arms
round
him
she
gathered
him
up
against
her
put
his
head
on
her
bosom
and
leaned
over
him
crooning
softly
as
though
he
were
asleep
she
beguiled
herself
by
saying
that
he
was
only
asleep
and
would
waken
presently
what
a
long
time
it
is
she
murmured
do
you
remember
davey
dear
the
night
before
father
and
i
went
away
and
i
ran
over
the
paddock
to
the
corner
of
the
road
to
see
you
i
was
angry
you
had
gone
away
without
wanting
to
see
me
yourself
you
kissed
me
and
i
kissed
you
and
i
promised
to
come
back
and
be
your
sweetheart
and
we
be
married
some
day
and
the
birds
laughed
and
the
were
out
by
the
road
there
was
a
beautiful
sunset
and
it
got
dark
soon
you
said
it
was
me
you
loved
and
not
jessie
then
i
went
away
and
it
has
never
been
the
same
since
but
it
will
be
when
you
are
well
and
i
can
tell
you
how
much
i
want
you
to
love
me
again
she
laughed
softly
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
go
home
in
the
cart
from
school
together
and
how
we
used
to
trot
lass
up
the
hillsides
to
make
her
poor
old
sides
go
like
bellows
and
you
showed
me
how
to
blow
birds
eggs
and
jess
said
i
was
a
little
lady
to
blow
birds
eggs
her
voice
ran
on
with
a
brooklike
tenderness
if
you
come
back
we
could
have
all
those
times
again
davey
she
whispered
looking
down
into
his
face
beneath
hers
just
when
there
was
the
faintest
shimmer
of
dawn
in
the
dim
windows
a
fluttering
breath
caught
her
face
she
put
the
spirit
to
his
lips
again
so
chafing
his
hands
and
calling
him
with
tearful
and
eager
little
cries
she
led
him
as
a
mother
leads
a
child
just
learning
to
walk
from
the
valley
of
the
shadows
davey
opened
his
eyes
they
dwelt
on
her
with
a
deep
serene
gaze
she
smiled
and
went
on
crooning
to
him
half
singing
half
sighing
that
beguiling
little
melody
of
tenderness
and
entreaty
warmth
came
back
to
him
his
breath
fell
regularly
and
sweetly
deirdre
took
the
sheepskins
out
of
the
bunk
and
put
them
under
him
on
the
floor
he
slept
a
faint
smile
on
his
mouth
his
hand
sought
hers
the
fingers
curled
round
it
she
sat
watching
him
a
mist
of
awe
and
joy
and
thankfulness
gathering
in
her
eyes
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
miracle
had
been
accomplished
that
night
in
narrow
valley
hut
chapter
xxxviii
when
the
broad
glare
of
the
morning
sun
broke
through
the
dingy
windows
of
the
hut
deirdre
started
from
the
cramped
position
in
which
she
had
fallen
her
head
leaning
wearily
against
a
box
she
was
aghast
to
find
that
she
had
been
asleep
as
she
woke
with
a
startled
exclamation
a
hand
went
out
to
her
her
eyes
met
davey
it
was
as
if
that
encounter
in
the
valley
of
shadows
had
brushed
all
misunderstandings
from
the
love
that
was
like
the
sun
between
them
deirdre
had
wrestled
with
death
for
possession
of
him
her
eyes
still
bore
the
shadow
of
the
conflict
davey
was
wan
and
vanquished
he
knew
that
she
had
wrested
his
spirit
from
the
darkness
on
which
it
had
been
drifting
and
the
knowledge
made
a
serene
joyousness
in
him
speech
deserted
them
they
had
no
voices
to
talk
with
just
this
gazing
of
eyes
on
eyes
told
all
that
there
was
to
tell
later
on
she
went
from
his
side
and
began
to
move
about
the
hut
gathering
the
brushwood
into
the
hearth
raking
over
the
ashes
and
making
the
fire
again
his
eyes
followed
her
the
hut
was
shabby
and
disorderly
by
daylight
conal
had
used
it
when
he
was
mustering
and
there
was
a
heap
of
rusty
irons
in
the
corner
a
few
hoarded
tins
and
jars
of
grease
on
the
shelves
some
old
clothes
boots
and
thongs
behind
the
door
the
bunk
with
its
sheepskins
and
a
table
made
of
a
rough
hewn
plank
on
three
poles
set
in
the
floor
were
the
only
furniture
deirdre
found
a
bundle
of
rags
on
the
shelf
near
the
hearth
and
searched
for
the
bottle
of
liniment
which
she
knew
was
kept
for
use
if
any
of
the
men
got
a
broken
hand
or
a
kick
from
a
beast
in
the
davey
knew
where
conal
had
stowed
these
things
while
they
were
working
there
together
he
tried
to
help
deirdre
to
find
them
she
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
you
must
move
she
said
a
compelling
tenderness
in
her
voice
he
fell
back
the
touch
of
her
hands
was
a
shock
of
joy
his
face
turned
up
to
her
wan
with
weakness
radiant
at
her
near
presence
his
eyes
went
through
hers
deirdre
the
cry
was
a
prayer
also
she
bent
over
him
her
arms
encircled
him
from
that
first
kiss
of
conscious
lovers
she
withdrew
a
little
tremulously
oh
you
must
be
still
she
cried
if
the
bleeding
begins
again
never
be
strong
you
must
lie
quiet
now
and
i
see
if
i
can
find
some
food
there
sure
to
be
flour
and
some
oatmeal
about
on
the
shelf
in
the
corner
by
the
hearth
davey
said
and
there
was
tea
in
a
tin
there
a
day
or
two
ago
she
found
them
and
they
breakfasted
on
a
weak
gruel
and
tea
without
milk
she
had
helped
davey
on
to
the
bunk
against
the
wall
and
spread
the
sheepskins
under
him
when
the
schoolmaster
and
teddy
came
into
the
yard
farrel
carried
a
bag
of
food
and
a
couple
of
blankets
strapped
to
his
saddle
deirdre
met
him
out
of
doors
the
sight
of
her
reassured
him
she
told
him
what
had
happened
during
the
night
of
davey
long
stillness
and
insensibility
and
of
conal
coming
a
few
hours
before
the
dawn
the
schoolmaster
went
into
the
hut
father
says
deirdre
went
straight
to
davey
he
does
believe
it
was
conal
fired
that
shot
at
you
her
eyes
went
out
to
him
troubled
and
beseeching
i
ca
help
thinking
it
was
myself
though
i
be
glad
not
to
been
such
a
big
brotherly
sort
of
man
to
me
always
conal
and
it
hurts
to
think
he
could
do
a
thing
like
that
she
continued
after
a
moment
father
says
conal
came
in
after
you
gone
last
night
he
been
drinking
but
his
voice
told
him
that
he
did
do
it
as
soon
as
he
knew
you
come
after
me
the
way
you
were
he
rode
out
after
you
for
fear
you
might
have
been
able
to
reach
here
do
do
you
think
it
was
conal
davey
davey
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
defence
of
conal
her
solicitude
and
desire
to
think
well
of
him
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
the
memory
of
that
whistling
shot
from
the
dark
trees
the
agony
of
his
long
ride
through
the
hills
came
back
to
him
all
i
know
he
said
bitterly
is
that
i
was
looking
for
him
before
i
left
the
town
to
tell
him
what
mother
had
told
me
about
the
raid
mcnab
and
the
old
man
and
were
getting
up
at
the
black
bull
they
said
they
been
baiting
conal
about
me
and
he
gone
out
looking
for
me
promising
to
do
for
me
some
one
said
he
gone
to
the
store
i
went
there
and
joe
wilson
told
me
he
seen
conal
riding
out
an
hour
earlier
i
thought
i
catch
him
up
on
the
road
it
was
from
the
trees
by
the
creek
the
shot
came
and
red
took
fright
there
nobody
else
got
a
grudge
against
you
davey
not
that
i
know
who
want
to
settle
me
that
way
mcnab
of
course
has
got
any
love
for
me
you
went
up
to
the
store
and
straight
out
along
the
road
past
the
bull
the
schoolmaster
asked
yes
but
i
seen
mcnab
in
the
bar
a
couple
of
minutes
before
it
could
have
been
him
farrel
threw
out
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
doubt
and
disappointment
deirdre
says
she
heard
conal
say
that
he
do
for
you
davey
he
said
but
she
did
think
he
meant
it
just
his
way
of
talking
mcnab
must
have
maddened
him
filled
him
up
with
drink
i
tell
you
how
it
goes
against
the
grain
to
believe
he
could
have
done
a
thing
like
this
and
yet
it
looks
like
it
was
he
back
when
you
came
away
this
morning
deirdre
asked
no
the
schoolmaster
replied
ask
him
when
he
comes
in
whether
he
did
or
did
not
fire
at
davey
she
said
i
take
his
word
will
you
davey
yes
davey
tone
was
a
little
uncertain
the
schoolmaster
went
to
the
door
again
davey
called
him
back
with
a
restless
movement
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
those
beasts
he
asked
querulously
they
better
here
than
at
steve
but
of
course
if
gets
a
tracker
it
would
take
him
long
to
find
them
teddy
got
them
in
the
paddock
this
morning
but
they
ought
to
be
moving
perhaps
conal
the
schoolmaster
began
oh
yes
i
forgot
conal
he
take
them
davey
fell
back
why
ca
you
take
them
yourself
he
inquired
the
schoolmaster
met
his
eyes
for
a
moment
lost
my
nerve
he
said
with
a
little
grating
laugh
and
turned
out
of
doors
deirdre
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
oh
she
gasped
breathlessly
how
dare
you
davey
how
dare
you
davey
morose
anger
in
his
eyes
stared
at
her
you
angry
because
he
let
me
go
out
last
night
she
said
do
you
know
he
almost
helpless
that
he
can
just
see
dimly
in
the
broad
daylight
all
the
world
going
dark
to
him
and
it
breaking
his
heart
eating
the
strength
and
the
soul
and
the
courage
out
of
him
to
stand
by
and
let
others
do
things
for
him
consciousness
of
what
he
had
done
came
slowly
to
davey
oh
it
was
mean
and
cruel
and
cowardly
to
hurt
him
like
that
deirdre
cried
passionately
and
ran
out
into
the
sunshine
after
her
father
when
she
came
back
into
the
hut
davey
with
a
tense
white
face
was
standing
near
the
door
i
ought
to
be
flayed
alive
but
i
did
know
i
did
understand
he
said
there
was
no
quieting
or
comforting
him
will
he
ever
forgive
me
do
you
think
he
will
deirdre
his
face
was
clammy
with
the
sweat
of
weakness
it
was
more
than
conal
did
that
conal
would
have
done
it
deirdre
went
for
the
schoolmaster
he
came
into
the
hut
again
he
and
davey
gripped
hands
then
the
schoolmaster
led
him
to
the
bunk
again
and
stretched
him
out
on
it
it
all
right
my
boy
all
right
he
said
brokenly
you
lie
still
now
and
let
deirdre
look
after
you
davey
vigorous
youth
rebelled
at
the
days
of
idleness
which
followed
the
wound
knitted
quickly
his
weakness
vanished
as
it
mended
conal
had
disappeared
no
one
had
seen
or
heard
of
him
since
the
night
of
the
wirree
races
the
schoolmaster
and
deirdre
had
accepted
his
disappearance
as
silent
proof
of
his
having
fired
the
shot
that
had
almost
cost
davey
his
life
when
they
went
back
to
the
shanty
steve
talked
incessantly
about
conal
although
no
more
had
been
heard
of
and
the
threatened
raid
had
never
been
made
he
was
not
easy
about
that
half
hundred
head
of
beasts
in
the
narrow
valley
paddock
at
the
end
of
the
week
davey
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
i
going
to
take
that
mob
to
the
melbourne
yards
he
said
we
run
them
any
longer
in
the
valley
it
too
risky
davey
the
schoolmaster
said
mcnab
too
quiet
to
be
harmless
and
there
only
one
man
could
run
the
mob
with
safety
and
that
conal
davey
asked
there
not
a
man
in
the
country
like
conal
with
cattle
he
knows
every
and
siding
on
the
ranges
then
he
with
the
men
on
the
roads
there
not
one
of
them
would
give
him
away
the
schoolmaster
said
i
could
run
them
the
line
on
davey
mouth
tightened
and
safer
than
conal
i
been
thinking
some
of
the
cows
have
father
brand
on
them
most
of
the
calves
ought
to
have
the
by
rights
i
suppose
got
the
cut
of
our
ayrshires
though
conal
done
the
double
m
pretty
neatly
on
them
what
the
old
man
will
be
mine
some
day
and
so
they
in
a
sort
of
way
my
cattle
too
i
can
say
i
do
think
ayrmuir
had
any
right
not
much
anyway
to
them
if
we
could
get
them
the
old
man
would
risk
a
couple
of
horses
on
the
rosses
and
morrisons
lost
three
horses
when
they
had
a
go
for
besides
there
is
a
man
on
our
place
could
have
yarded
them
conal
got
them
we
were
with
him
you
can
hold
his
share
for
this
batch
when
i
bring
it
to
you
but
i
going
to
drive
saying
they
are
donald
cameron
cattle
so
they
are
most
of
them
i
be
driving
my
own
cattle
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
it
may
be
realising
on
the
estate
a
forced
loan
from
the
old
man
you
may
say
my
name
will
carry
me
through
and
when
the
deal
over
i
can
make
it
right
with
father
i
going
home
ca
think
what
conal
means
leavin
so
long
steve
muttered
irritably
we
ca
have
them
on
our
hands
any
longer
davey
voice
was
short
and
irritable
too
you
right
davey
the
schoolmaster
spoke
slowly
thoughtfully
what
you
say
makes
the
getting
rid
of
them
sound
easy
but
i
hardly
like
the
idea
of
taking
your
share
after
the
way
i
put
it
davey
interrupted
but
as
far
as
i
concerned
they
conal
beasts
and
your
and
mine
because
we
got
them
nobody
else
could
and
they
were
any
good
to
anybody
eating
their
heads
off
in
the
hills
but
for
all
the
world
it
as
if
i
had
contracted
with
you
to
do
it
on
behalf
of
the
estate
ayrmuir
gets
a
third
of
the
profits
i
hand
it
over
to
the
old
man
and
as
likely
as
not
he
be
glad
enough
to
see
it
for
a
couple
of
dozen
breakaways
and
scrubbers
he
never
expected
to
make
a
penny
out
of
again
the
schoolmaster
gesture
of
impatience
was
one
of
resignation
also
it
a
specious
argument
davey
he
said
but
i
wish
to
heaven
kept
clear
of
the
whole
business
that
evening
davey
called
deirdre
and
they
wandered
down
the
hillside
watching
the
sun
set
on
the
distant
edge
of
the
plains
that
stretched
northwards
and
inland
from
the
rise
beyond
steve
i
going
he
said
and
told
her
of
the
promise
he
had
made
his
mother
i
feel
it
up
to
me
to
carry
this
job
through
but
when
it
over
i
coming
back
going
home
when
i
come
back
will
you
marry
me
deirdre
yes
she
said
simply
but
if
you
only
give
up
going
davey
davey
face
had
a
look
of
his
father
for
the
moment
a
sombre
obstinacy
there
something
in
the
game
he
said
you
on
your
mettle
to
carry
it
through
when
you
begun
but
you
need
worry
i
be
all
right
my
story
be
good
enough
if
there
is
any
trouble
deirdre
sighed
but
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
your
going
she
said
if
only
you
would
chapter
xxxix
deirdre
watched
davey
going
out
of
narrow
valley
in
the
dim
starlight
of
the
early
spring
morning
the
mob
hustled
by
teddy
and
the
dogs
a
stream
of
red
and
brown
and
dappled
hides
before
him
the
cows
lifted
their
heads
bellowing
protestingly
their
breath
steamed
before
them
in
the
chill
air
the
horses
and
dogs
heeling
and
wheeling
them
and
the
trampling
hoofs
of
the
herd
beat
a
mist
from
the
cold
and
still
sleeping
earth
davey
was
to
steer
by
the
stars
till
he
came
to
a
point
on
the
road
that
would
give
him
a
clear
and
easy
descent
to
the
sale
yards
on
the
outskirts
of
melbourne
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
to
try
the
usual
route
he
was
to
take
a
winding
track
on
the
edge
of
the
swamp
that
lay
between
the
southern
hills
and
port
phillip
only
the
blacks
knew
the
paths
through
the
reeds
and
dense
scrubs
conal
had
tried
to
cross
it
once
in
the
summer
and
got
bogged
there
losing
a
score
of
fine
beasts
if
conal
could
not
find
his
way
across
it
the
schoolmaster
did
not
think
that
davey
could
it
was
only
in
case
of
untoward
happenings
that
he
advised
trusting
to
the
black
knowledge
of
the
tracks
through
the
swamp
and
taking
to
the
cover
of
the
almost
impenetrable
scrub
that
covered
it
davey
had
given
his
word
to
the
schoolmaster
that
if
he
met
conal
he
would
give
the
cattle
over
to
him
and
return
to
the
hills
i
give
everything
i
got
in
the
world
if
you
never
been
brought
into
this
business
he
had
said
deeply
moved
just
before
davey
rode
out
father
blaming
himself
davey
deirdre
said
davey
wrung
the
schoolmaster
hand
i
would
have
been
in
it
if
i
had
broken
my
word
to
you
he
said
i
promised
you
when
i
brought
up
that
first
mob
for
conal
clear
out
after
did
i
but
conal
offered
me
the
job
and
you
bet
i
would
been
out
of
a
moonlighting
either
if
i
could
helped
it
but
this
business
i
never
meant
you
to
be
in
it
farrel
said
bitterly
i
never
meant
to
be
in
it
myself
davey
circumstances
were
too
strong
for
me
a
drowning
man
clutches
a
straw
they
say
deirdre
had
ridden
to
the
valley
she
had
watched
the
mob
go
out
across
the
plains
watched
until
men
cattle
horses
and
dogs
a
moving
blur
in
the
mists
disappeared
altogether
and
the
faint
lowing
of
the
beasts
came
to
her
no
longer
she
waited
impatiently
for
news
of
davey
though
she
knew
none
could
come
for
weeks
there
were
few
travellers
on
this
overland
track
conal
and
one
or
two
others
had
used
it
with
teddy
to
guide
them
if
they
wanted
to
take
the
short
cut
across
the
scrubs
of
the
swamp
there
were
northern
paths
into
new
south
wales
but
it
was
a
long
and
roundabout
journey
to
port
phillip
from
the
southern
ranges
father
deirdre
said
impulsively
one
morning
soon
after
davey
had
gone
i
going
to
see
cameron
i
been
thinking
she
must
be
anxious
about
davey
and
wanting
news
of
him
she
be
glad
to
see
you
no
doubt
he
said
there
one
subject
you
wo
speak
to
her
of
though
deirdre
he
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
knew
what
he
meant
he
did
not
want
cameron
to
know
that
his
sight
was
almost
gone
yes
i
understand
deirdre
said
socks
as
sensitive
to
the
keen
air
the
sunshine
the
fluty
ripplings
and
of
the
birds
as
deirdre
was
rollicked
gaily
down
the
track
to
cameron
his
white
stockings
flashed
as
he
thudded
along
his
unshod
hoofs
fell
with
a
soft
beat
on
the
grassy
waysides
deirdre
sang
softly
to
herself
as
they
passed
under
the
arching
trees
her
thoughts
went
drifting
away
dreamily
to
the
time
when
davey
would
come
back
and
she
would
call
going
to
ayrmuir
going
home
it
was
an
eager
tremulous
greeting
that
cameron
gave
her
it
you
dearie
she
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
indeed
what
can
you
tell
me
of
davey
he
was
to
have
come
home
to
us
and
i
have
seen
him
for
weeks
there
was
much
to
tell
and
yet
much
that
the
girl
in
her
tender
solicitude
for
davey
mother
could
not
tell
it
would
terrify
her
to
know
that
someone
had
shot
at
and
nearly
killed
him
that
davey
had
an
enemy
who
would
go
to
these
lengths
when
he
was
back
with
her
he
might
tell
her
himself
what
had
kept
him
away
but
it
would
stretch
her
soul
to
the
limit
of
anguish
deirdre
knew
to
tell
her
now
yes
davey
told
me
he
was
coming
home
deirdre
said
smiling
her
eyes
met
davey
mother
with
their
secret
no
secret
but
mary
cameron
was
thinking
only
of
her
boy
and
in
her
anxiety
although
she
realised
that
davey
and
deirdre
understood
each
other
she
did
not
ask
any
questions
and
deirdre
said
nothing
thinking
it
was
for
davey
to
tell
his
mother
i
knew
you
be
anxious
about
him
the
girl
said
with
a
sigh
and
that
why
i
came
he
gone
overland
with
some
of
maitland
cattle
but
he
ought
to
be
back
in
a
week
now
and
then
he
be
coming
straight
here
ah
dear
tears
welled
in
cameron
eyes
how
glad
i
be
deirdre
went
with
her
into
the
parlour
and
they
sat
down
and
talked
together
awhile
there
was
a
new
and
tender
understanding
between
them
cameron
talked
of
her
loneliness
and
the
joy
would
be
to
her
oh
i
have
prayed
so
deirdre
she
said
it
has
nearly
broken
my
heart
being
without
him
what
with
the
long
nights
here
and
the
sorrow
that
has
come
upon
us
that
was
all
she
said
of
the
other
trouble
yet
it
had
almost
broken
her
and
had
taken
all
her
fortitude
and
patient
wifeliness
to
endure
an
instinct
of
blind
fidelity
was
part
of
mary
cameron
when
deirdre
was
going
she
kissed
her
there
was
lingering
affection
in
the
pressure
of
her
lips
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
dear
she
said
it
almost
as
if
you
were
my
own
child
i
love
you
like
that
deirdre
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
now
i
will
get
davey
room
ready
for
him
and
the
little
room
you
used
to
sleep
in
you
be
coming
to
stay
with
us
again
when
he
comes
home
wo
you
oh
i
could
laugh
and
cry
with
happiness
to
think
the
old
times
will
come
again
deirdre
laughed
a
little
laugh
of
shy
joyousness
she
could
not
tell
cameron
that
she
would
be
coming
to
stay
with
her
altogether
soon
davey
will
be
able
to
get
on
better
with
his
father
now
cameron
continued
giving
expression
to
her
dreams
he
will
be
able
to
get
donald
to
do
what
he
wants
without
angering
him
his
father
has
lost
many
of
the
ways
he
had
and
you
would
believe
how
he
loves
the
boy
in
spite
of
everything
it
a
strange
dour
way
a
man
has
of
loving
sometimes
dear
hard
to
bear
it
love
all
the
same
not
love
the
way
women
love
that
tries
to
make
life
easy
for
the
dear
one
it
all
tenderness
and
sacrifice
a
woman
love
deirdre
sometimes
a
man
loves
that
way
too
deirdre
said
she
had
swung
into
her
saddle
and
was
looking
away
before
her
over
the
hills
for
a
moment
her
eyes
lay
on
cameron
face
with
its
eyes
delicate
contour
exquisite
line
of
lips
loving
and
lovable
her
face
had
lost
its
youthful
freshness
but
its
beauty
was
unimpaired
so
tender
its
expression
so
compelling
and
pure
the
light
of
her
eyes
though
a
lonely
soul
looked
out
of
them
pained
and
wondering
deirdre
pressed
her
heels
into
the
chestnut
she
and
the
horse
disappeared
among
the
trees
she
talked
of
cameron
to
her
father
it
would
break
your
heart
to
see
the
change
in
her
she
said
but
i
ca
see
her
any
more
he
said
brusquely
deirdre
realised
the
wound
that
she
had
opened
she
had
never
quite
forgiven
davey
mother
for
the
fact
that
dan
had
lost
his
sight
on
her
account
cameron
never
seemed
to
realise
it
and
that
had
angered
the
girl
perhaps
cameron
did
not
know
what
the
schoolmaster
had
done
for
her
deirdre
told
herself
sometimes
but
davey
knew
and
she
could
hardly
believe
that
cameron
was
ignorant
though
she
never
seemed
to
take
the
schoolmaster
injury
as
a
personal
matter
deirdre
looked
down
on
his
face
dark
and
sombre
now
scarcely
anything
of
its
old
reckless
gaiety
was
left
lines
had
been
carved
on
it
by
bitter
thought
and
brooding
on
the
utter
night
he
was
travelling
into
she
rubbed
her
soft
cheek
against
his
tell
me
he
said
with
an
effort
how
she
looks
deirdre
she
looks
the
girl
said
hesitatingly
she
looks
i
ca
explain
how
as
if
something
that
burned
inside
of
her
had
gone
out
but
she
beautiful
like
she
used
to
be
he
begged
she
used
to
have
a
way
of
looking
at
you
that
i
never
saw
with
anybody
else
his
voice
was
trembling
yes
deirdre
said
slowly
she
beautiful
like
she
used
to
be
though
her
hair
got
grey
in
it
and
the
colour
of
the
pink
orchids
has
gone
out
of
her
skin
and
she
looks
at
you
that
way
i
know
what
you
mean
as
if
she
were
seeing
not
only
the
outside
you
it
her
eyes
and
the
way
her
lips
lie
together
tell
you
about
her
real
self
and
make
you
love
her
even
when
you
do
want
to
the
schoolmaster
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
deirdre
gazed
at
him
then
she
turned
away
with
a
little
sigh
his
face
was
almost
a
mirror
to
her
now
that
he
was
blind
she
could
see
his
thoughts
in
it
it
was
sacred
to
her
that
thin
lined
face
all
its
reverence
and
emotion
but
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
and
feel
that
she
was
stealing
his
secrets
when
his
eyes
could
not
guard
them
from
her
she
went
to
the
seat
under
the
window
and
sat
there
thinking
idly
aimlessly
for
awhile
recollections
of
cameron
were
always
those
of
a
woman
occupied
with
her
home
her
husband
and
son
deirdre
wondered
how
her
father
came
to
be
in
cameron
debt
as
he
had
said
he
was
how
it
was
he
owed
her
anything
at
all
she
seemed
to
owe
him
so
much
the
cows
had
gathered
up
to
the
fence
near
the
bails
for
the
milking
they
were
lowing
quietly
the
sunshine
making
a
luminous
mist
behind
them
the
birds
were
laughing
and
hooting
among
the
trees
deirdre
rose
to
go
and
do
the
milking
but
steve
burst
open
the
door
from
the
a
moment
before
there
had
been
a
clatter
of
hoofs
on
the
shingle
steve
stood
on
the
threshold
the
muscles
of
his
face
twitching
it
pete
from
the
wirree
he
gasped
he
says
they
got
davey
at
port
phillip
for
duffing
chapter
xl
it
was
early
next
morning
that
cameron
cart
with
its
slowly
moving
heavy
grey
horse
drew
up
before
steve
and
cameron
herself
got
down
from
it
the
schoolmaster
was
pacing
the
long
kitchen
he
had
not
been
still
a
moment
since
pete
brought
his
news
pete
had
gone
back
to
the
wirree
to
see
if
anything
more
had
been
heard
of
davey
whether
he
was
to
be
brought
back
to
the
district
for
trial
or
was
being
held
in
melbourne
the
story
of
his
arrest
had
come
through
on
the
vessel
that
brought
stores
to
port
southern
but
it
was
very
vague
a
rumour
had
reached
the
an
hour
or
two
before
she
was
sailing
that
a
young
man
saying
he
was
david
cameron
young
davey
cameron
of
son
had
been
arrested
for
and
that
he
and
a
nigger
were
being
detained
on
the
charge
pete
had
not
returned
but
the
schoolmaster
set
about
making
preparations
for
a
journey
deirdre
had
packed
his
tucker
bag
his
blanket
was
rolled
up
to
strap
on
his
saddle
which
way
are
you
going
deirdre
asked
she
knew
that
the
schooner
would
probably
be
gone
before
he
could
reach
the
port
and
that
it
would
continue
its
passage
along
the
coast
to
rane
before
turning
back
and
making
for
port
phillip
he
had
thought
of
all
that
too
i
ride
he
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
anxiously
i
do
know
out
of
the
chaos
of
his
thoughts
no
plan
of
action
had
yet
formed
then
cameron
came
deirdre
brought
her
into
the
kitchen
it
cameron
father
she
said
and
left
them
farrel
turned
in
the
direction
of
her
voice
he
made
a
movement
towards
cameron
who
was
standing
just
within
the
doorway
his
hand
went
out
with
a
seeking
motion
i
i
ca
see
you
he
said
a
little
querulously
her
hand
met
his
she
knew
from
his
face
the
desperate
and
troubled
state
of
mind
he
was
in
and
he
hers
from
her
fluttered
breath
and
the
sob
that
went
with
it
i
come
to
ask
you
to
keep
a
promise
she
said
yes
you
remember
the
promise
for
a
moment
he
did
not
remember
any
words
any
formal
undertaking
but
he
knew
to
what
she
referred
you
said
long
ago
her
voice
was
scarcely
audible
that
if
ever
you
could
do
anything
for
me
or
mine
yes
he
said
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
i
want
to
she
sank
into
a
chair
her
hands
flew
to
her
bonnet
strings
she
untied
them
you
know
what
it
is
i
want
you
to
do
she
asked
yes
he
felt
for
his
chair
it
was
near
the
one
she
had
taken
he
sat
down
and
turned
his
face
towards
her
he
could
just
see
a
dim
outline
of
her
against
the
morning
brightness
to
him
she
was
a
grey
figure
with
a
heavy
black
shadow
about
her
he
strained
to
meet
her
eyes
again
the
very
magic
of
them
seemed
to
illumine
her
face
for
him
show
him
its
beautiful
outlines
and
yet
perhaps
he
did
not
see
them
at
all
it
was
all
memory
and
vivid
imagining
that
gave
him
the
illusion
he
did
not
see
her
face
thin
and
lined
with
pain
and
loneliness
the
patience
and
vague
disappointment
that
had
come
to
dwell
in
her
eyes
i
want
you
to
get
the
boy
off
for
me
to
have
this
charge
removed
she
said
tremulously
the
schoolmaster
knew
that
this
was
what
he
had
meant
to
try
to
do
but
now
that
she
had
asked
him
he
told
himself
that
it
must
be
done
the
means
employed
to
lift
the
burden
of
blame
from
davey
shoulders
he
knew
would
have
to
be
very
sure
ones
davey
himself
would
not
say
anything
to
implicate
conal
or
anyone
else
evidently
the
story
of
his
droving
for
donald
cameron
had
not
carried
much
weight
yes
the
schoolmaster
said
i
will
he
had
no
doubt
of
himself
now
that
she
had
appealed
to
him
oh
she
cried
after
a
few
moments
i
knew
that
it
was
some
mischief
to
us
mcnab
was
planning
i
can
see
it
all
now
i
thought
it
was
you
or
conal
he
was
trying
to
get
at
mcnab
told
donald
that
cattle
were
being
moonlighted
most
of
them
ayrmuir
breakaways
and
wild
cattle
at
the
back
of
our
hills
but
he
did
not
know
that
davey
was
droving
for
conal
not
till
he
asked
me
this
morning
and
i
told
him
i
did
know
myself
till
a
few
days
ago
when
davey
came
to
me
after
church
then
he
said
he
been
working
with
conal
and
i
begged
him
not
to
any
more
and
told
him
what
his
father
and
mcnab
were
trying
to
do
he
promised
to
come
home
but
he
never
came
i
was
afraid
to
tell
his
father
for
fear
never
forgive
him
and
every
day
i
thought
davey
be
coming
in
the
gate
mcnab
knew
of
course
everybody
else
in
the
wirree
seems
to
have
known
but
us
that
davey
was
with
conal
it
was
to
bring
our
pride
in
the
dust
to
make
davey
father
the
shamed
and
disgraced
man
he
is
he
did
it
but
where
conal
how
is
it
he
not
there
with
davey
why
did
davey
ever
go
in
for
this
business
why
are
you
in
it
i
thought
that
you
would
never
be
doing
anything
again
that
would
bring
you
under
the
law
the
distress
and
reproach
in
her
voice
hurt
him
i
thought
so
too
he
said
bitterly
he
did
not
attempt
to
excuse
himself
and
the
sightless
eyes
that
gazed
at
her
did
not
accuse
his
mind
was
back
to
the
subject
between
them
this
is
the
concern
of
two
men
i
and
another
he
said
davey
was
no
more
than
a
hired
drover
besides
where
is
conal
cameron
asked
away
his
tone
forbade
further
inquiry
there
was
silence
a
moment
how
does
cameron
take
it
he
broken
altogether
would
he
the
schoolmaster
hesitated
would
he
consent
to
say
that
davey
was
droving
for
him
there
were
cows
in
the
mob
cameron
hesitated
i
think
he
would
do
anything
anything
in
the
world
to
get
the
boy
off
she
said
i
do
know
that
it
would
do
whether
it
would
work
the
schoolmaster
said
a
little
wearily
probably
davey
has
said
that
he
was
putting
the
mob
through
for
his
father
he
said
he
would
if
anything
happened
if
inquiries
are
made
will
you
tell
cameron
to
back
up
the
story
it
the
only
chance
davey
may
have
been
only
detained
until
it
could
be
ascertained
whether
he
is
donald
cameron
son
and
whether
cameron
authorised
him
to
sell
the
cattle
it
would
be
a
splendid
opportunity
to
spoil
mcnab
game
if
it
could
be
done
but
if
for
some
reason
i
do
know
of
yet
it
ca
be
worked
another
way
you
mean
you
say
you
were
responsible
davey
was
only
a
drover
with
you
cameron
asked
yes
she
uttered
a
little
cry
it
was
what
i
meant
you
to
do
but
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
she
said
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
schoolmaster
was
thinking
deeply
too
the
iron
of
despair
had
entered
his
soul
what
will
it
mean
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
three
years
hard
labour
on
the
roads
of
the
colony
or
other
place
as
the
judge
may
direct
he
quoted
his
voice
a
little
uncertain
tell
me
she
said
rising
a
tide
of
feeling
carrying
fire
to
her
eyes
dignity
to
her
figure
and
a
subtle
timbre
to
her
voice
would
you
rather
i
had
not
come
would
you
rather
i
had
let
davey
take
his
punishment
i
not
sure
that
he
does
not
deserve
it
in
spite
of
what
you
say
no
farrel
cried
passionately
he
grasped
her
hand
his
face
fell
over
it
it
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
me
to
do
something
for
you
he
said
cameron
caught
her
breath
when
for
a
moment
he
carried
her
fingers
to
his
lips
you
look
after
deirdre
he
said
if
yes
she
stood
uncertainly
looking
at
him
a
pitiful
quivering
emotion
in
her
eyes
then
she
moved
away
he
said
mechanically
hearing
the
brush
of
her
garments
as
she
left
the
room
she
said
deirdre
saw
that
cameron
cheeks
were
wet
with
tears
when
she
climbed
into
the
buggy
again
she
did
not
speak
but
drove
silently
away
deirdre
had
been
rubbing
bess
nose
and
feeding
her
with
handfuls
of
grass
when
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
her
father
was
sitting
with
his
arms
over
the
side
of
his
chair
his
head
on
them
she
flew
to
him
her
arms
entwined
him
but
he
pushed
her
away
with
unconscious
roughness
go
away
he
whispered
an
angry
pain
at
his
grief
at
cameron
who
in
some
way
had
been
the
cause
of
it
surged
through
deirdre
pete
rode
into
the
yard
he
threw
his
bridle
over
the
hitching
post
any
news
deirdre
asked
he
shook
his
head
and
went
into
the
kitchen
later
the
schoolmaster
called
steve
in
she
heard
steve
voice
raised
complainingly
her
father
with
settled
determination
against
it
her
heart
was
sore
why
was
he
not
telling
her
his
plans
as
he
was
telling
steve
she
heard
him
arranging
to
take
pete
with
him
to
melbourne
i
going
too
father
she
cried
flashing
into
the
kitchen
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
talking
to
every
one
else
and
my
heart
breaking
the
schoolmaster
drew
her
into
his
arms
you
not
coming
dear
he
said
you
best
out
of
this
i
want
you
to
wait
here
with
steve
till
davey
comes
back
and
you
too
father
he
held
her
close
in
his
arms
yes
me
too
of
course
darling
he
crushed
her
face
against
his
it
great
times
we
had
together
my
darling
is
it
he
asked
i
do
like
going
without
you
but
it
better
it
great
times
had
together
and
now
i
an
old
blind
devil
that
would
be
able
to
look
after
you
properly
in
the
town
it
not
a
nice
place
for
a
girl
to
be
going
about
in
and
i
be
no
good
to
look
after
you
no
more
than
a
burden
pete
here
be
my
guide
and
take
me
by
the
track
round
the
swamp
to
melbourne
he
says
he
could
do
the
short
cut
across
the
swamp
but
he
knows
the
roundabout
track
all
right
we
have
to
be
busy
on
davey
account
then
you
be
a
good
wife
to
davey
wo
you
darling
and
happy
as
the
day
long
when
he
gets
back
but
you
do
love
me
too
do
you
darling
black
head
for
god
sake
say
you
love
me
his
voice
broke
deirdre
flung
her
arms
about
him
reckless
of
all
but
that
some
trouble
within
had
forced
that
cry
there
was
a
bitter
undertone
in
his
words
that
she
did
not
understand
although
she
associated
them
in
some
way
with
davey
mother
and
the
disturbance
and
mental
turmoil
into
which
davey
arrest
had
put
him
i
love
you
she
cried
more
than
all
the
world
more
than
davey
more
than
anyone
or
anything
in
it
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
what
a
jealous
brute
i
am
he
murmured
to
have
taken
that
from
you
there
nothing
you
have
told
me
she
asked
searching
his
face
no
he
replied
turning
his
face
from
her
and
burying
it
in
her
hair
you
have
told
me
anything
at
all
of
what
you
going
to
do
to
get
davey
off
she
said
sharply
oh
well
he
parried
i
do
know
i
have
decided
it
will
depend
upon
circumstances
he
recognised
the
anxiety
of
her
voice
you
are
going
to
try
and
get
him
off
by
putting
yourself
in
his
place
are
you
she
asked
doubtfully
you
really
been
less
in
the
thing
than
he
has
and
he
young
and
strong
and
oh
no
the
schoolmaster
laughed
lightly
i
would
try
to
do
that
he
went
out
to
the
when
the
kangaroo
was
saddled
he
took
deirdre
in
his
arms
again
she
watched
him
cantering
down
the
road
on
the
great
raking
grey
towards
the
inland
plains
pete
on
one
of
steve
horses
a
few
yards
behind
him
the
thought
of
that
cry
of
his
troubled
her
why
had
he
said
for
god
sake
say
you
love
me
the
flood
of
her
love
for
him
rose
and
filled
her
the
love
of
all
those
early
years
when
he
had
been
mother
brother
and
playfellow
little
pictures
of
his
tenderness
of
his
gay
of
his
care
flitted
before
her
because
for
years
it
had
moved
so
tranquilly
she
had
scarcely
realised
the
depth
and
power
of
that
passionate
affection
but
now
that
he
had
called
for
it
showed
his
need
of
it
as
he
had
never
done
even
in
the
old
days
it
surged
tempestuously
chapter
xli
so
the
schoolmaster
swearin
young
davey
cameron
was
no
more
than
a
hired
drover
to
him
said
mcnab
he
was
talking
to
steve
what
that
you
saying
deirdre
came
to
the
doorway
mcnab
had
just
arrived
a
skinny
boy
from
the
wirree
was
taking
his
horse
and
cart
to
the
stables
she
had
seen
it
draw
up
a
few
minutes
before
and
wondered
why
mcnab
had
come
she
had
heard
greeting
to
him
and
mcnab
reply
oh
there
you
are
deirdre
he
said
shuffling
towards
her
and
holding
out
his
hand
she
disregarded
it
looking
into
his
eyes
mcnab
was
in
a
good
temper
the
smile
wrinkling
the
skin
about
his
mouth
told
that
he
had
some
secret
cause
for
being
well
pleased
with
himself
and
the
world
at
large
he
could
afford
to
forgive
her
what
that
you
were
saying
about
father
she
asked
have
you
heard
why
it
out
of
the
world
you
are
here
steve
the
talk
of
wirreeford
this
business
of
young
davey
duffin
and
the
schoolmaster
says
it
none
of
davey
cameron
business
but
his
i
was
sure
farrel
was
in
it
meself
before
had
me
suspicions
of
course
but
nothing
to
go
on
conal
business
i
knew
it
was
but
the
devil
who
gave
him
long
legs
knows
where
he
is
he
knew
when
to
leave
smells
a
sinking
ship
like
a
rat
at
sea
conal
does
neither
deirdre
nor
steve
spoke
mcnab
eyes
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
he
continued
chuckling
as
though
enjoying
the
joke
he
saying
the
schoolmaster
that
young
davey
was
a
good
stockman
and
when
he
quarrelled
with
his
father
he
gave
him
a
job
and
was
paying
him
wages
till
he
got
something
else
to
do
or
went
home
again
and
there
was
no
more
to
it
than
that
davey
of
course
tried
to
bluff
things
out
at
first
but
there
was
an
information
out
signed
by
cameron
so
the
story
would
wash
that
he
was
on
business
deirdre
clenched
her
hands
as
mcnab
giggled
there
was
a
malicious
slow
glimmer
in
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
her
when
cameron
got
a
suspicion
someone
was
liftin
cattle
from
the
back
hills
he
was
busy
enough
givin
information
keen
enough
to
catch
the
moonlighters
but
he
did
on
his
boy
being
taken
in
charge
of
a
mob
troopers
in
melbourne
did
believe
davey
yarn
about
being
his
father
son
seein
they
got
donald
cameron
written
word
against
mobs
coming
from
the
south
to
the
markets
thereabouts
farrel
story
is
a
good
he
says
he
struck
a
bargain
with
donald
cameron
as
agent
for
maitland
stock
and
store
dealers
of
cooburra
new
south
wales
a
couple
of
years
ago
these
beasts
were
to
have
gone
over
the
border
when
next
some
of
maitland
stockmen
were
in
the
south
but
the
rivers
were
down
the
stock
rollin
fat
and
prices
up
so
he
thought
it
a
pity
to
lose
the
market
and
sent
young
davey
with
round
the
swamp
to
melbourne
yards
not
telling
him
details
of
the
deal
davey
had
a
difference
with
his
father
was
glad
of
the
job
it
a
sort
of
challenge
to
cameron
clever
of
the
schoolmaster
i
wonder
what
do
about
it
he
can
see
it
a
for
davey
if
he
stands
to
it
a
for
the
schoolmaster
too
if
he
does
well
i
think
davey
your
father
my
dear
spend
a
bit
of
time
on
the
roads
the
queer
part
of
the
business
is
that
though
half
a
dozen
men
beasts
may
be
in
the
mob
the
brands
been
so
neatly
faked
no
one
can
swear
to
all
the
clear
skins
got
maitland
brand
on
so
the
charge
of
stand
or
fall
be
what
cameron
says
or
does
a
couple
of
cows
with
on
are
the
only
in
the
lot
he
wo
put
his
own
son
away
blurted
steve
not
mcnab
fidgeted
hardly
likely
deirdre
cried
mick
ross
bud
morrison
were
in
here
couple
of
nights
ago
steve
went
on
and
they
said
they
swear
blind
none
of
their
beasts
were
in
the
lot
all
the
hill
settler
be
prepared
to
do
the
same
they
said
rather
than
put
davey
or
the
schoolmaster
in
a
fix
y
es
snarled
mcnab
so
i
told
deirdre
laughed
his
disgust
and
disappointment
delighted
her
you
did
reckon
on
that
did
you
mcnab
she
said
she
went
off
down
the
road
to
the
paddock
where
steve
two
milking
cows
were
and
presently
drove
them
one
swinging
before
the
other
into
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
shanty
she
was
easier
in
her
mind
than
she
had
been
since
the
schoolmaster
had
gone
even
since
davey
rode
out
of
narrow
valley
but
the
sight
of
mcnab
disturbed
her
she
bailed
and
the
cows
wondering
why
he
had
come
as
she
milked
and
the
milk
fell
with
a
gentle
swish
into
the
pail
between
her
knees
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
merely
to
bring
them
the
good
news
that
davey
and
the
schoolmaster
were
likely
to
get
off
she
turned
the
cows
into
the
paddock
beside
the
bails
and
took
the
pail
of
warm
milk
indoors
when
she
went
into
the
kitchen
mcnab
was
sitting
in
the
big
chair
by
the
fire
he
looked
up
at
her
the
firelight
showed
his
face
and
the
smile
that
glimmered
on
it
he
seemed
to
be
remembering
and
with
triumph
that
other
night
when
he
had
sat
there
steve
crouched
on
the
bench
opposite
him
was
shivering
and
sobbing
deirdre
put
the
milk
in
its
place
what
the
matter
what
have
you
done
to
him
she
cried
facing
mcnab
he
took
a
heavy
chain
from
his
pocket
it
clanked
with
a
dull
slow
sound
steve
started
from
his
chair
oh
send
him
away
deirdre
send
him
away
he
sobbed
deirdre
knew
the
meaning
of
the
trick
she
had
heard
it
often
it
was
an
old
dodge
to
discover
escaped
convicts
this
clanking
of
a
chain
near
them
a
man
who
had
worn
irons
never
forgot
the
sound
they
made
and
whenever
he
heard
it
would
start
and
tremble
the
rage
that
burned
to
a
white
heat
kept
her
silent
a
moment
you
never
thought
it
would
you
deirdre
him
a
lag
and
you
a
lag
daughter
mcnab
chuckled
it
a
lie
is
it
you
ask
uncle
steve
it
been
a
puzzle
to
me
eighteen
years
why
two
chaps
from
the
island
never
came
for
the
help
that
was
promised
and
they
with
a
reward
out
against
them
i
knew
they
got
safe
up
the
river
because
a
boat
was
found
on
the
bank
beyond
where
is
now
i
meant
to
touch
a
bit
of
that
reward
too
but
it
never
too
late
to
mend
as
they
say
you
never
send
us
back
to
the
island
steve
cried
you
never
do
that
mcnab
would
i
mcnab
laughed
softly
he
was
enjoying
the
spectacle
of
whimpering
the
trembling
of
his
withered
limbs
the
sense
of
power
that
it
gave
him
you
deirdre
gasped
but
anger
choked
her
there
now
he
interrupted
i
would
be
calling
me
names
if
i
were
you
deirdre
after
the
pretty
way
you
treated
me
a
month
or
two
ago
too
would
you
be
forgettin
my
dear
it
would
be
a
pity
to
make
an
enemy
of
me
as
i
said
once
before
it
a
bad
enemy
i
make
they
say
and
a
nasty
temper
i
got
when
i
roused
but
there
nothing
i
would
do
for
you
deirdre
you
can
twist
me
round
your
little
finger
if
you
like
the
firelight
was
in
his
eyes
see
here
steve
he
said
i
got
something
to
say
to
deirdre
a
sensible
girl
got
her
head
on
we
old
pals
me
deirdre
you
go
outside
while
i
talk
things
over
with
her
we
see
what
can
be
done
steve
scuttled
across
the
room
he
was
crying
helplessly
and
pulled
his
coat
sleeve
across
his
nose
as
he
went
to
the
door
now
mcnab
said
genially
you
sit
there
deirdre
and
we
can
talk
deirdre
took
the
chair
steve
had
left
she
sat
very
stiff
and
straight
in
it
she
knew
what
was
coming
there
were
fear
and
loathing
in
her
eyes
but
mcnab
only
saw
how
great
and
dark
they
were
how
red
the
curve
of
her
lips
how
full
of
vigour
and
grace
the
lines
of
her
strong
young
body
you
know
what
happen
if
it
known
farrel
an
escaped
convict
he
asked
yes
port
arthur
irons
the
rest
of
it
well
nobody
need
know
lest
i
like
there
a
couple
of
lads
can
prove
who
steve
and
father
are
but
they
wo
lest
i
like
what
are
you
going
to
like
that
what
i
want
to
know
deirdre
cried
her
hands
gripping
the
arms
of
the
chair
depends
on
you
my
dear
he
leant
forward
there
was
appeal
in
her
eyes
but
her
eagerness
her
hunted
air
only
stirred
in
mcnab
a
lust
for
the
capture
and
taming
of
her
if
you
promise
to
marry
me
nothing
be
heard
of
it
he
said
deirdre
was
not
surprised
she
had
expected
something
like
what
he
had
said
the
sound
of
it
stunned
her
nevertheless
the
schoolmaster
get
off
this
affair
of
the
cattle
but
that
only
three
years
mcnab
said
the
other
be
till
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
probably
for
the
end
of
his
life
my
dear
steve
a
month
or
two
be
the
end
of
him
you
the
price
of
their
freedom
you
pays
money
and
takes
choice
deirdre
deirdre
did
not
hear
him
after
all
she
was
thinking
this
was
a
proposition
she
was
even
grateful
for
it
anything
seemed
better
than
helplessness
hopelessness
the
terrible
prospect
of
not
being
able
to
avert
this
ultimate
catastrophe
which
threatened
dan
all
that
had
been
sensitive
to
joy
or
sorrow
in
her
seemed
dead
she
realised
only
one
overwhelming
necessity
one
fact
crowding
out
all
others
filled
her
mind
thad
mcnab
had
said
that
dan
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
island
and
that
she
could
prevent
it
she
did
not
think
of
davey
at
all
except
to
remember
vaguely
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
and
that
now
she
was
going
to
break
her
promise
and
say
that
she
would
marry
mcnab
if
she
looked
at
him
as
he
sat
by
the
hearth
misshapen
with
unkempt
brakish
hair
and
beard
turning
grey
wrinkled
and
withered
he
was
no
mate
for
her
glowing
youth
but
what
did
that
matter
she
saw
the
schoolmaster
face
as
she
had
last
seen
it
the
dear
thin
eager
face
with
deep
lines
drawn
by
the
sleepless
ache
of
his
heart
on
it
she
knew
now
why
there
had
been
an
underlying
grief
and
bitterness
in
what
he
said
when
he
went
away
knew
that
he
must
have
been
afraid
of
recognition
and
its
consequences
but
cameron
had
required
him
to
save
davey
it
was
all
plain
now
yet
deirdre
realised
that
what
he
had
done
he
would
probably
have
done
without
her
having
to
ask
for
it
what
part
had
cameron
had
in
his
life
that
she
could
command
him
that
she
dared
ask
him
to
lay
down
his
life
for
her
what
had
she
done
for
him
in
the
old
time
the
schoolmaster
had
said
we
owe
her
more
than
either
you
or
i
can
hope
to
repay
deirdre
but
surely
he
had
paid
on
the
night
of
the
fires
if
at
no
other
time
and
now
mcnab
gaze
on
her
recalled
her
mind
to
what
he
had
said
she
met
it
steadily
unwaveringly
yes
she
would
marry
him
if
her
thought
went
back
on
its
track
if
what
yes
if
dan
got
off
if
he
did
not
get
the
three
years
if
he
had
to
go
to
prison
for
three
years
then
it
would
be
no
use
to
marry
mcnab
he
could
not
help
dan
then
for
three
years
he
would
have
to
live
in
a
prison
wear
filthy
hideous
clothes
work
like
a
beast
of
burden
i
tell
you
this
day
week
she
said
think
you
know
then
how
the
trial
goin
he
snarled
well
there
an
end
to
three
years
do
forget
my
pretty
and
if
he
gets
an
acquittal
on
this
the
other
come
out
unless
she
measured
him
with
her
eyes
you
marry
me
the
day
he
is
free
of
this
charge
if
he
gets
free
or
on
the
day
he
gets
his
three
years
if
he
goin
to
get
them
and
you
do
want
to
be
for
life
he
leaned
forward
his
voice
husky
with
eagerness
if
you
change
mind
my
dear
of
course
i
can
change
mine
he
laughed
uneasily
his
fingers
twitching
but
i
give
you
till
this
day
week
to
make
up
mind
which
it
is
to
be
then
you
give
me
answer
is
it
a
bargain
yes
deirdre
said
she
was
dull
and
weary
beaten
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
shuffled
towards
the
door
then
i
go
and
get
the
house
ready
for
you
he
cried
gleefully
i
not
afraid
what
answer
be
oh
you
snared
my
pretty
bird
and
there
no
way
out
for
you
if
you
keep
dan
farrel
as
he
calls
himself
out
of
the
darbies
and
him
in
his
blindness
going
to
the
island
again
it
taken
a
heap
of
schemin
to
get
you
but
i
set
my
mind
on
you
when
i
saw
you
a
slip
of
a
girl
coquettin
with
conal
at
hegarty
the
night
you
came
back
to
the
wirree
the
desolation
of
her
attitude
reassured
him
my
pretty
he
said
in
the
doorway
and
someday
when
my
wife
deirdre
you
kiss
me
he
went
out
with
a
chattering
clatter
of
laughter
steve
came
back
to
the
kitchen
have
you
been
able
to
manage
him
deirdre
he
asked
feverishly
what
have
you
said
to
him
to
go
back
there
his
face
worked
pitifully
his
hands
twisted
over
each
other
you
do
know
what
it
is
like
i
kill
myself
rather
than
go
back
deirdre
and
your
father
what
he
do
it
be
worse
for
him
than
for
me
he
got
you
to
think
of
what
did
mcnab
say
will
he
do
anything
for
you
deirdre
he
said
he
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
and
you
want
him
to
help
us
would
you
you
would
let
dan
and
old
uncle
stevie
go
over
there
again
it
be
all
right
she
said
looking
past
him
you
must
think
of
it
any
more
stevie
it
was
just
to
worry
you
he
said
that
oh
it
a
wonderful
girl
you
are
he
clung
to
her
hand
fondling
it
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
nobody
here
to
save
us
your
father
and
me
but
you
deirdre
and
you
to
deal
with
mcnab
send
him
away
with
a
smile
pleased
with
himself
no
idea
of
the
terms
mcnab
was
likely
to
have
made
with
her
occurred
to
him
if
only
there
been
someone
here
to
help
us
she
cried
passionately
if
only
father
or
davey
or
even
conal
had
been
here
but
to
have
had
to
meet
it
alone
her
voice
broke
she
began
to
cry
finding
relief
in
utter
abandonment
steve
put
his
arms
round
her
trying
to
comfort
her
deirdre
deirdre
he
muttered
distressfully
do
cry
it
your
father
own
girl
you
are
so
brave
meetin
the
devil
himself
with
your
clear
eyes
me
no
more
than
a
shiverin
old
corpse
where
he
is
deirdre
lifted
her
eyes
she
looked
into
the
pathetic
quiveringly
childish
old
face
bent
over
her
it
the
best
thing
you
could
have
said
to
me
that
i
my
father
own
girl
uncle
stevie
she
said
my
father
girl
should
be
crying
like
this
when
there
work
and
a
lot
of
thinking
to
do
chapter
xlii
there
bad
news
from
cameron
deirdre
steve
came
in
from
the
road
a
bullock
wagon
had
just
passed
from
the
wirree
deirdre
had
seen
it
halt
up
she
had
seen
the
bullocks
standing
with
dumb
dull
patience
under
the
yoke
swinging
their
tails
to
keep
the
flies
off
some
of
them
had
gone
down
on
their
knees
by
the
roadside
while
the
teamster
had
a
drink
and
yarned
with
steve
then
she
had
heard
the
cracking
of
the
teamster
whip
his
oaths
and
calls
to
the
beasts
and
the
creaking
of
the
heavy
cart
as
it
went
on
again
what
is
it
she
asked
breathlessly
thinking
of
davey
old
cameron
steve
said
johnny
watson
says
he
was
found
dead
on
the
road
by
long
gully
a
tree
fallen
on
him
this
morning
steve
there
was
horror
and
yet
a
vague
relief
in
her
exclamation
johnny
says
cameron
went
down
to
the
black
bull
yesterday
evening
and
there
was
trouble
between
him
and
mcnab
mcnab
having
let
him
in
for
this
cattle
stealin
case
knowing
davey
was
in
it
steve
went
on
but
thad
got
round
him
somehow
telling
him
that
he
did
know
davey
was
in
it
and
he

off
anyhow
bein
cameron
son
buttered
the
old
man
up
that
way
conal
and
the
schoolmaster
be
nabbed
for
sure
he
made
out
they
were
good
enough
friends
when
they
parted
only
he
had
a
jugful
and
a
couple
of
the
boys
had
to
give
him
a
to
his
horse
the
brute
must
shied
at
the
dead
tree
near
the
gully
the
ground
was
cut
up
round
it
it
fell
on
them
both
cameron
found
this
morning
i
go
and
see
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
her
deirdre
took
her
hat
down
from
behind
the
door
steve
went
on
talking
of
donald
cameron
muttering
in
his
vague
childish
fashion
however
he
came
to
get
in
with
mcnab
i
ca
make
out
he
said
there
were
no
two
greater
enemies
a
while
back
oh
he
was
as
mean
as
you
make
them
but
he
made
his
mark
in
the
country
deirdre
had
on
her
hat
i
going
steve
she
said
i
wo
stay
unless
cameron
got
no
one
with
her
but
the
rosses
and
morrison
are
sure
to
be
there
right
deirdre
he
replied
she
took
her
bridle
from
its
nail
by
the
door
and
went
into
the
paddock
beyond
the
stable
calling
the
chestnut
he
heard
her
cry
coup
lad
coup
laddie
and
saw
the
at
her
call
come
galloping
across
the
grass
gilded
with
sunshine
she
slipped
the
bridle
over
his
head
brought
him
into
the
yard
saddled
him
and
turned
out
to
the
road
with
thoughts
of
the
tragedy
that
had
befallen
cameron
as
she
went
along
the
winding
track
under
the
trees
were
woven
wonderings
as
to
how
donald
cameron
sudden
death
would
affect
davey
and
the
schoolmaster
it
was
on
the
roadside
by
the
long
gully
that
cameron
had
died
the
old
tree
by
the
gully
had
fallen
at
last
and
on
donald
cameron
at
rane
while
dan
and
she
were
living
there
a
man
had
been
killed
by
a
falling
tree
but
it
was
strange
that
davey
father
should
have
died
in
this
way
she
thought
he
who
had
been
the
first
settler
in
the
hills
she
wondered
if
he
had
the
tree
score
its
living
green
wood
if
he
had
killed
it
and
in
turn
it
had
killed
him
pinning
him
to
the
earth
with
its
great
bulk
of
dead
and
rotting
timber
she
could
see
davey
father
heavy
in
shabby
dark
clothes
lying
beneath
it
his
grey
hair
his
face
bruised
and
blackened
the
man
who
had
conquered
the
wilderness
had
lain
there
on
the
very
road
he
had
made
broken
cast
aside
a
thing
that
life
had
done
with
it
was
as
if
the
wilderness
had
taken
its
revenge
she
slipped
from
the
chestnut
back
in
a
sunny
clearing
and
gathered
a
handful
of
freckled
and
white
twisted
some
tendrils
of
creepers
and
blades
of
ferns
among
them
and
tied
them
together
with
a
long
piece
of
grass
when
she
came
in
sight
of
the
weatherboard
house
crouching
against
the
purple
wall
of
the
hills
deirdre
realised
again
what
donald
cameron
had
done
the
cleared
paddocks
spread
round
it
on
every
side
an
orchard
climbing
the
slope
to
the
left
showed
in
dark
leafage
against
the
grey
and
green
of
the
forest
cattle
dappled
the
furthest
hillside
the
barns
and
sheds
and
stables
behind
the
house
formed
a
small
village
he
had
made
it
cleared
the
forest
for
it
he
had
done
all
this
she
realised
and
so
much
besides
and
now
he
was
dead
the
man
of
iron
will
and
indefatigable
energy
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
neighbours
carts
in
cameron
yard
deirdre
opened
the
gate
and
shut
it
when
she
and
white
socks
had
passed
through
she
hung
the
chestnut
bridle
over
a
post
by
the
barn
and
lifted
his
saddle
speckled
fowls
and
handsome
buff
and
yellow
pullets
stalked
about
the
yard
pecking
industriously
even
under
the
legs
of
the
ross
and
morrison
horses
which
with
harness
looped
back
on
them
their
noses
deep
in
fodder
bags
stood
beside
the
carts
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
on
a
struck
against
the
clear
blue
sky
a
black
rooster
crowed
at
intervals
cameron
was
in
deirdre
heard
the
hushed
talking
exclamations
and
sound
of
weeping
as
she
went
into
it
it
you
deirdre
cameron
said
when
she
saw
the
girl
her
voice
was
flat
and
tired
she
seemed
to
have
scarcely
strength
enough
to
speak
deirdre
kissed
her
with
quivering
lips
and
eyes
welling
the
room
was
full
of
people
she
did
not
see
who
they
were
at
first
in
the
half
dark
if
only
davey
were
here
cameron
cried
deirdre
knelt
beside
her
perhaps
he
come
she
whispered
did
you
gather
the
flowers
for
his
father
cameron
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
little
bouquet
in
deirdre
hands
i
brought
them
for
davey
deirdre
said
cameron
hands
quivered
in
hers
we
must
keep
her
cheerful
not
let
her
spirits
get
down
one
of
the
visitors
said
in
deirdre
ear
jessie
ross
brought
in
tea
and
some
scones
you
must
eat
this
now
dear
to
keep
up
your
strength
ross
said
to
cameron
taking
a
chair
beside
her
ross
talked
of
her
milking
and
the
calves
she
had
poddied
during
the
wet
weather
and
the
other
women
gathering
round
talked
in
serious
and
melancholy
fashion
of
their
milking
and
the
calves
they
had
had
trouble
with
during
the
winter
they
gave
each
other
recipes
for
cream
cheese
and
jam
and
cakes
to
be
made
without
eggs
and
i
discovered
a
sure
way
of
making
hens
lay
in
the
winter
said
ross
have
you
replied
cameron
listlessly
yes
indeed
and
i
tell
you
just
what
it
is
mary
oh
it
of
no
interest
to
me
now
with
davey
away
and
his
father
gone
cameron
cried
she
kept
her
hold
of
deirdre
hand
to
think
of
him
davey
father
in
there
deirdre
lying
so
still
and
cold
he
that
was
so
strong
and
nobody
could
break
or
turn
she
said
you
have
seen
him
yet
you
must
come
with
me
presently
dearie
but
you
must
drink
your
tea
and
eat
this
little
bit
of
scone
first
ross
said
the
neighbours
talked
again
nervously
cheerfully
in
subdued
tones
of
the
weather
the
sales
and
what
the
men
of
their
households
were
saying
about
things
in
general
we
must
let
her
brood
they
said
anxiously
to
each
other
cameron
did
not
seem
to
hear
or
notice
them
when
she
stood
in
the
silent
room
with
deirdre
looking
down
on
the
figure
of
davey
father
she
turned
to
the
girl
with
a
sharp
cry
it
a
sad
sad
thing
to
be
parting
from
your
life
mate
deirdre
she
said
to
think
that
he
should
have
died
like
that
after
all
that
he
done
he
that
made
this
hill
country
to
have
gone
without
a
word
from
anyone
or
a
of
the
misunderstandings
between
us
and
davey
not
to
see
him
again
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
utterly
ross
and
morrison
took
her
each
by
an
arm
and
led
her
back
to
the
the
hum
of
strained
subdued
and
cheerful
conversation
began
again
cameron
went
to
the
door
with
deirdre
if
only
they
let
me
be
child
she
cried
kissing
her
if
only
they
let
me
be
it
very
good
of
them
all
to
bother
but
if
only
they
let
me
be
as
the
chestnut
padded
softly
along
the
track
home
to
steve
deirdre
wondered
again
what
effect
donald
cameron
death
would
have
on
davey
and
dan
it
would
make
davey
a
rich
man
she
knew
donald
cameron
had
been
reputed
wealthy
when
she
and
the
schoolmaster
first
came
to
the
hills
and
he
had
not
been
drinking
long
enough
to
have
squandered
much
money
it
would
take
more
than
a
gallon
of
rum
to
make
old
cameron
loosen
his
purse
strings
she
remembered
having
heard
conal
say
to
dan
and
to
her
it
would
make
very
little
difference
in
the
end
there
would
still
be
mcnab
the
train
of
her
thought
snapped
for
a
moment
with
all
her
passionate
youth
she
envied
donald
cameron
his
stillness
a
night
and
a
day
remained
before
she
would
have
to
tell
mcnab
that
she
had
made
her
choice
every
beat
of
the
chestnut
hoofs
on
the
soft
roadside
drove
what
he
had
said
into
her
brain
she
knew
no
more
now
than
she
did
a
week
ago
what
was
going
to
happen
to
davey
and
the
schoolmaster
or
how
the
case
was
going
perhaps
less
since
donald
cameron
death
but
her
mind
was
made
up
as
to
what
mcnab
answer
would
be
she
had
never
really
had
any
doubt
as
to
what
it
must
be
and
had
asked
for
time
as
one
asks
to
have
the
window
open
before
settling
down
to
passing
the
day
in
a
dark
and
airless
room
deep
in
her
mind
there
was
still
however
a
vagrant
hope
a
fairy
thing
a
phantom
assurance
of
the
impossibility
of
what
was
demanded
of
her
a
belief
like
as
faint
and
fragile
that
something
unheard
of
miraculous
would
happen
to
help
her
and
at
the
same
time
save
dan
and
steve
and
davey
chapter
xliii
the
big
kitchen
was
very
quiet
the
log
that
had
been
smouldering
on
the
open
hearth
all
day
broke
deirdre
swept
back
the
scattered
embers
and
thrust
the
broken
ends
of
wood
together
flames
leapt
over
them
lighting
the
room
they
penetrated
the
shadows
that
bulked
huge
and
shapeless
at
the
end
of
it
revealing
a
hoard
of
store
casks
and
boxes
piled
almost
to
the
roof
and
with
hessian
bags
sewed
together
the
barrel
of
a
rifle
slung
on
the
walls
glimmered
for
a
moment
the
firelight
showed
stirrup
irons
and
miscellaneous
harnessing
gear
halters
and
bridles
hung
over
a
peg
near
the
door
a
couple
of
nailed
to
it
and
two
or
three
hams
in
bags
with
bunches
of
herbs
beside
them
strung
up
to
the
rafters
a
tallow
dip
cast
a
halo
of
garish
light
about
deirdre
where
she
sat
sewing
a
broad
gleam
touched
the
crockery
on
the
shelves
behind
her
the
in
which
steve
lay
slack
and
nodding
drowsily
was
drawn
up
before
the
fire
the
door
to
the
bar
reached
by
a
step
from
the
kitchen
was
open
a
dip
burned
on
the
bench
there
too
giving
the
dingy
windows
of
the
shanty
a
gleam
for
wayfarers
it
was
a
wild
night
the
wind
blowing
from
the
beat
against
the
doors
and
rattled
the
windows
of
the
frail
building
the
doors
were
all
shut
though
it
was
still
early
steve
at
last
fell
asleep
in
his
chair
his
breathing
had
the
sound
of
a
child
sobbing
deirdre
looked
up
from
her
work
again
and
again
troubled
by
it
it
increased
her
sense
of
desperation
to
hear
him
the
sound
became
unendurable
she
got
up
at
last
and
awakened
him
had
you
better
go
to
bed
uncle
steve
she
said
impatiently
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
like
this
it
too
late
for
anybody
to
be
coming
our
way
now
and
a
bad
night
i
lock
up
yes
deirdre
he
murmured
sleepily
it
a
bad
night
and
too
late
for
anybody
to
be
coming
our
way
she
pulled
the
bolts
across
the
doors
at
the
front
of
the
shanty
and
locked
and
bolted
the
door
from
the
bar
into
the
kitchen
then
she
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
out
of
his
chair
he
had
fallen
back
into
it
nodding
drowsily
again
she
led
him
over
to
his
room
which
opened
off
the
kitchen
i
see
the
lights
and
the
fires
are
out
she
said
but
i
want
to
finish
a
bit
of
mending
before
i
go
to
bed
right
he
murmured
right
deirdre
the
noise
of
the
wind
carried
off
the
droning
tones
of
his
voice
but
it
was
only
a
few
moments
before
she
heard
his
heavy
breathing
again
the
schoolmaster
sock
which
she
was
darning
dropped
from
her
hand
she
stared
into
the
darkness
beyond
the
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
bed
to
be
alone
in
the
darkness
with
her
thoughts
in
the
kitchen
she
heard
the
creaking
gossip
of
the
fire
and
the
whisper
of
falling
embers
besides
she
wanted
to
keep
her
hands
and
brain
busy
in
the
darkness
there
would
be
only
the
voice
of
the
wind
in
her
ears
and
that
was
like
the
crying
of
her
heart
she
listened
to
the
wind
now
a
mournful
passionate
thing
it
murmured
about
the
house
rising
wildly
desperately
in
blasts
of
sudden
rage
and
fell
back
into
a
thin
pitiful
wailing
of
helplessness
and
despair
she
was
afraid
to
listen
long
afraid
of
what
this
communicating
interpreting
murmur
might
do
with
her
reason
yet
the
wind
was
with
her
she
thought
the
wind
knew
her
heart
the
wind
was
the
voice
of
her
heart
crying
out
there
in
the
darkness
she
shivered
trying
to
banish
the
strange
fantastical
ideas
that
swarmed
upon
her
how
to
pass
the
night
this
long
night
in
which
she
must
not
think
or
feel
mcnab
would
be
coming
you
pays
money
and
you
takes
choice
deirdre
he
had
said
she
saw
his
face
as
he
had
spoken
his
twisted
sallow
face
the
glimmering
of
his
malicious
eyes
with
the
smile
that
spilled
over
from
them
she
had
made
her
choice
she
had
set
her
mind
to
it
there
must
be
no
wavering
if
the
schoolmaster
got
off
she
must
marry
mcnab
if
he
was
sentenced
to
three
years
imprisonment
there
would
perhaps
be
time
to
scheme
and
him
she
would
set
her
wits
to
that
but
she
could
not
think
of
the
next
day
she
must
think
of
davey
or
dan
or
steve
any
of
them
there
must
be
no
shrinking
shrieking
or
failing
what
had
to
be
done
had
to
be
done
and
the
first
thing
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
give
mcnab
her
word
she
picked
up
the
sock
she
had
been
mending
again
the
needle
slipped
backwards
and
forwards
across
under
and
over
the
dark
threads
she
worked
steadily
the
voice
of
the
wind
drew
her
mind
again
it
tugged
gently
and
then
carried
her
away
on
its
plaintive
wailing
her
hands
fell
in
her
lap
as
she
listened
her
heart
swayed
it
went
out
to
the
wind
again
there
was
a
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
on
the
road
the
sound
startled
her
but
it
was
not
until
she
heard
the
dogs
barking
in
the
yard
that
she
realised
some
late
rider
had
come
to
steve
that
there
would
be
food
and
drink
and
probably
a
shakedown
to
get
ready
she
waited
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
verandah
and
a
rap
on
the
door
of
the
bar
the
flung
open
and
on
a
gust
of
wind
and
rain
a
tall
gaunt
figure
swung
into
the
kitchen
conal
deirdre
cried
and
flew
to
him
in
her
gladness
at
seeing
him
the
past
was
a
blurred
page
she
forgot
it
when
she
saw
him
in
the
doorway
his
face
turned
to
her
her
confidence
in
him
all
the
old
joyous
affection
rushed
over
her
his
face
was
shining
with
rain
his
hair
and
beard
wet
from
the
way
his
breath
came
and
went
and
the
muscles
were
whipped
out
from
his
neck
she
knew
that
he
had
been
riding
hard
they
tell
me
davey
and
dan
are
on
trial
in
melbourne
he
said
yes
what
happened
what
been
doing
deirdre
he
gasped
i
only
just
heard
of
it
it
taken
me
a
couple
of
days
to
get
here
i
do
know
anything
but
what
i
told
you
thought
you
could
tell
me
something
before
i
go
up
to
them
and
give
me
something
to
eat
and
drink
i
have
had
anything
since
yesterday
morning
he
wrenched
off
his
wet
coat
and
dropped
into
steve
chair
he
had
a
gauntness
that
conal
used
not
to
have
but
his
eyes
those
eyes
of
fierce
tenderness
were
the
eyes
of
the
big
brotherly
man
who
had
been
the
companion
of
so
many
of
her
and
the
schoolmaster
wanderings
she
quickly
put
some
food
on
the
table
for
him
set
the
kettle
on
the
bar
over
the
fire
and
while
he
was
eating
told
him
what
she
knew
of
davey
arrest
and
dan
going
to
swear
davey
innocence
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
why
did
he
do
that
davey
was
more
in
it
than
he
was
conal
asked
savagely
i
do
know
deirdre
hesitated
yes
i
do
conal
it
was
because
cameron
oh
that
was
it
was
it
conal
went
on
eating
hungrily
what
do
they
say
about
here
do
they
think
davey
get
off
and
have
to
pay
you
heard
of
cameron
death
conal
deirdre
asked
they
say
that
make
all
the
difference
davey
ca
very
well
be
accused
of
stealing
his
own
cattle
and
mcnab
what
has
he
got
to
say
about
it
of
course
it
his
hand
in
it
all
he
says
i
the
cause
her
voice
faltered
what
that
conal
knife
and
fork
clattered
to
the
table
did
you
know
she
asked
did
you
know
conal
steve
and
father
came
from
the
island
over
there
he
moved
uneasily
no
he
said
but
uncertainly
who
says
so
mcnab
he
did
the
chain
trick
here
on
steve
scared
him
to
death
when
he
was
by
himself
one
afternoon
seems
he
was
quite
sure
before
but
steve
in
his
fright
gave
him
all
the
proofs
he
wanted
and
promised
to
use
all
he
knows
against
father
and
steve
unless
says
he
only
put
the
troopers
on
to
this
cattle
business
to
get
you
and
davey
out
of
the
way
though
he
had
another
score
to
work
off
against
cameron
too
but
he
says
he
always
suspected
about
steve
and
father
and
was
only
waiting
for
a
chance
to
be
sure
of
it
to
make
me
make
me
marry
him
by
god
conal
spun
from
his
chair
his
oaths
startled
the
birds
from
their
night
perches
under
the
roof
he
not
do
that
deirdre
he
cried
not
while
there
life
in
me
rot
him
the
crawler
to
come
here
scaring
the
wits
out
of
you
screw
the
last
breath
out
of
him
before
he
made
for
the
door
deirdre
went
after
him
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
do
no
good
now
conal
she
said
you
done
yourself

till
morning
then
you
can
go
to
mcnab
if
he
knows
there
a
man
about
to
stand
by
me
he
wo
dare
to
do
what
he
said
conal
jerked
himself
away
from
her
no
i
swear

nothing
at
all
if
you

she
urged
and
i

nobody
without
you
if
you
only
rest
and
sleep
now
and
go
in
the
morning
it
be
better
you
be
able
to
put
the
fear
of
god
into
mcnab
perhaps
if
he
sees
you
strong
and
ready
to
make
him
do
what
you
want
sleep
he
cursed
under
his
breath
do
you
think
there

come
to
me
when
i
think
that
mcnab
a
filthy
damned
swine
like
mcnab
could
come
near
you
i
kill
him
kill
him
if
he
touched
a
hair
of
your
head
her
hands
fell
from
him
conal
face
was
distorted
with
rage
his
words
brought
back
memory
of
the
shot
that
had
almost
killed
davey
conal
guessed
what
her
movement
meant
do
you
still
believe
he
lifted
her
chin
and
looked
into
her
eyes
do
you
still
believe
i
fired
that
shot
in
the
dark
deirdre
did
you
conal
she
asked
simply
he
turned
from
her
with
a
gesture
of
disappointment
oh
it
was
in
anger
and
when
you
were
sure
of
what
you
were
doing
i
know
she
cried
he
opened
the
door
you
not
going
she
asked
no

right
it
be
better
to
wait
till
the
morning
he
said
with
for
conal
a
strange
quietude

give

mare

rub

feed

the
fire
for
me
i
be
in
directly
chapter
xliv
conal
was
early
astir
deirdre
heard
him
moving
in
the
kitchen
and
then
out
of
doors
when
he
came
in
again
she
had
spread
a
cloth
on
the
end
of
the
table
bacon
and
eggs
were
spluttering
in
a
shallow
pan
on
the
hearth
a
pot
of
porridge
was
ready
for
him
the
kettle
steaming
conal
face
was
sombre
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
not
slept
and
that
his
mind
was
set
to
a
plan
of
action
he
ate
without
speaking
and
got
up
to
go
ginger
was
standing
saddled
by
the
door
her
reins
trailing
beside
her
she
cropped
the
young
grass
that
showed
vivid
green
blades
about
the
water
barrel
and
was
nourished
by
the
drips
from
the
roof
spouts
and
leakages
from
the
barrel
itself
deirdre
heard
the
click
click
of
ginger
snaffle
the
chirping
of
young
birds
under
the
roof
while
conal
was
eating
there
was
a
solemnity
a
purposefulness
about
him
this
morning
she
dared
not
ask
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
it
was
a
fresh
morning
with
frost
in
the
air
a
sparkling
rime
lay
out
on
the
grass
in
the
paddocks
and
spread
under
the
straggling
shade
of
the
sheds
and
the
stables
in
crisp
white
patches
the
sunshine
splashed
golden
over
the
hills
it
lay
in
long
shafts
of
purest
brilliance
on
the
paddocks
and
across
the
stable
yard
conal
went
out
of
doors
deirdre
followed
him
conal
she
cried
there
was
appeal
in
her
voice
he
had
gathered
ginger
reins
in
his
hand
the
mare
turned
her
head
her
great
beautiful
eyes
on
deirdre
it
no
good
you
saying
anything
deirdre
telling
me
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
conal
said
roughly
i
thought
it
all
out
i
know
what
got
to
be
done
i
do
it
the
best
way
i
can
he
understood
the
prayer
of
her
eyes
think
i
want
his
blood
on
my
hands
he
asked
irritably
but
he
got
to
let
you
go
deirdre
he
got
to
there
no
two
ways
about
it
and
if
he
says
a
word
about
the
schoolmaster
or
steve
he
have
to
with
me
then
and
the
reckoning
be
a
short
one
that
the
bargain
i
going
to
make
with
him
and
i
hold
him
responsible
if
ever
the
story
gets
out
he
pay
all
the
same
and
i
swear
that
on
the
soul
of
my
mother
do
you
think
my
life
worth
a
straw
to
me
do
you
think
if
it
is
a
question
of
yours
and
dan
life
against
mcnab
i
can
hesitate
he
threw
back
his
head
with
the
old
reckless
movement
not
much
lord
i
take
what
was
coming
to
me
cheerin
if
i
thought
i
put
things
right
for
the
schoolmaster
and
you
but
if
a
knocking
about
do
thad
any
good
instead
he
welcome
to
it
if
i
can
get
what
i
want
out
of
him
with
a
scarin
there
be
no
need
to
go
further
if
i
promise
him
on
the
reddest
oath
under
the
sun
and
he
pretty
sure
i
mean
it
it
do
instead
perhaps
but
i
not
taking
any
chances
of
his
trickin
me
i
ca
afford
to
take
chances
deirdre
if
i
do
feel
i
got
him
that
way
she
knew
what
he
meant
it
be
a
long
day
till
you
back
conal
she
said
he
swung
into
his
saddle
and
went
out
to
the
road
she
watched
the
bay
with
her
long
easy
stride
and
conal
swinging
above
her
till
the
trees
hid
them
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
when
conal
let
his
tongue
loose
unleashed
the
rage
in
him
mcnab
would
do
what
he
wanted
conal
was
not
known
as
fighting
conal
for
nothing
and
he
was
credited
with
being
a
man
of
his
word
reckless
and
as
he
was
none
knew
better
than
mcnab
that
he
cared
neither
for
god
nor
man
when
his
blood
was
up
and
that
he
would
assuredly
do
as
he
said
though
the
heavens
fell
everybody
knew
the
cringing
coward
mcnab
was
more
than
one
of
the
men
he
had
sold
had
threatened
to
wipe
off
old
scores
without
leave
or
licence
a
threat
more
or
less
might
not
have
mattered
but
each
one
intensified
mcnab
terror
of
the
clutch
of
iron
finger
in
the
night
the
swift
blade
of
a
knife
the
short
bark
of
a
pistol
it
was
easy
to
scare
steve
with
a
clank
of
a
chain
but
the
click
of
a
pistol
behind
mcnab
turned
him
livid
a
greenish
hue
spread
on
his
face
deirdre
knew
the
frenzy
of
mcnab
fear
but
she
knew
too
his
shrewd
brain
while
conal
was
there
he
would
dominate
convert
him
into
the
shaking
shrieking
thing
mcnab
became
when
the
fear
of
violence
or
a
violent
death
took
possession
of
him
but
afterwards
when
conal
was
gone
his
brain
would
get
to
work
that
cunning
brain
of
his
quickened
by
a
sense
of
his
injuries
and
his
spluttering
passionate
fear
and
hate
of
the
man
who
had
humiliated
and
thwarted
him
deirdre
wondered
how
it
would
fare
with
conal
then
whether
mcnab
would
outwit
him
he
would
try
he
was
made
that
way
mcnab
to
scheme
out
of
holes
and
corners
if
conal
would
have
to
reckon
with
him
in
the
end
she
realised
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
let
the
reckoning
be
now
before
any
further
mischief
was
done
yet
her
mind
shuddered
at
the
thought
she
knew
that
she
had
meant
to
delay
it
when
steve
came
shambling
into
the
yard
blinking
at
the
sunlight
she
told
him
that
conal
had
returned
and
that
he
had
gone
down
to
the
black
bull
but
would
be
back
by
the
evening
he
exclaimed
all
the
morning
about
conal
coming
and
had
a
thousand
questions
to
ask
where
had
conal
been
what
had
he
been
doing
why
was
it
he
had
gone
off
the
way
he
did
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
all
of
which
deirdre
had
not
thought
to
ask
but
they
talked
about
conal
all
the
morning
steve
came
in
from
cutting
ferns
for
the
to
ask
if
conal
was
going
to
stay
long
what
was
he
going
to
do
was
he
going
up
to
the
trial
had
she
told
him
what
mcnab
had
said
to
them
deirdre
wanted
to
be
very
busy
all
day
so
that
the
time
would
not
seem
long
till
conal
returned
steve
with
his
questions
made
a
little
current
of
joyous
excitement
ordinarily
the
days
were
very
still
and
empty
she
swept
and
dusted
cooked
their
food
washed
the
dishes
and
sewed
with
latterly
only
anxious
thoughts
to
occupy
her
mind
how
is
he
lookin
conal
steve
asked
coming
to
the
door
when
she
was
beating
cream
into
butter
in
a
delft
bowl
he
had
come
in
as
the
idea
for
a
new
question
occurred
to
him
oh
well
she
said
but
he
been
riding
hard
and
was
tired
out
i
think
he
a
bit
thinner
than
he
used
to
be
and
he
was
awfully
hungry
you
gave
him
a
drop
of
grog
he
asked
anxiously
deirdre
nodded
he
was
wet
through
i
thought
he
have
his
death
of
cold
but
he
was
all
right
this
morning
oh
yes
where
did
he
come
from
she
shook
her
head
had
you
better
finish
laying
down
the
ferns
she
said
he
may
be
back
sooner
than
we
think
and
then
you
want
to
talk
to
him
oh
yes
he
shuffled
out
of
doors
again
a
moment
later
he
put
his
head
in
the
window
his
shabby
drooping
hat
was
outlined
against
the
blank
of
sunshine
his
face
looked
in
at
her
under
the
shadow
of
his
hat
bright
with
a
question
what
did
he
go
to
the
wirree
for
deirdre
oh
she
hesitated
he
wanted
to
see
mcnab
why
steve
chewed
the
cud
of
a
wondering
thought
why
did
he
want
to
see
mcnab
deirdre
he
tell
you
when
he
comes
she
said
the
bare
kitchen
had
the
musky
warm
smell
of
bread
and
of
curdy
sweet
buttermilk
by
the
afternoon
deirdre
had
made
bread
and
new
butter
for
conal
she
had
prepared
a
good
meal
for
him
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
after
she
had
scrubbed
the
wooden
table
until
it
was
of
a
weathered
whiteness
and
redded
the
bricks
round
the
hearth
she
looked
about
for
other
household
tasks
to
work
at
so
that
the
day
would
seem
shorter
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
she
brushed
her
hair
twisted
it
up
anew
put
on
a
fresh
frock
and
sat
down
to
sew
until
conal
came
steve
went
out
to
the
road
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
him
deirdre
glanced
at
the
shadows
the
trees
cast
she
dared
not
expect
conal
before
sunset
her
needle
flew
in
and
out
of
a
piece
of
stiff
unbleached
linen
cameron
had
given
her
some
time
ago
she
thought
of
her
when
she
was
afraid
to
think
of
conal
and
what
was
happening
in
wirreeford
the
sun
sank
behind
the
distant
line
of
hills
and
the
jackasses
on
the
high
branches
of
a
tree
by
the
road
laughed
their
to
the
sun
she
could
not
restrain
her
impatience
any
longer
and
went
to
the
road
her
eyes
strained
to
see
conal
and
his
bay
horse
forging
out
of
the
gloom
that
was
beginning
to
gather
amongst
the
trees
hanging
mysterious
impalpable
veils
across
the
ends
of
the
track
where
the
trees
met
over
it
and
it
dwindled
into
a
wavering
thread
she
lay
down
by
the
roadside
and
pressed
her
ear
to
the
earth
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
but
only
the
forest
murmurs
came
to
her
the
moan
of
the
wind
in
the
valleys
the
leafy
murmur
of
the
trees
the
creaking
of
broken
and
swaying
branches
the
faint
calling
of
birds
all
confused
and
mingled
in
a
vague
wave
of
sound
the
last
hoot
hoot
of
the
jackasses
in
the
misty
depths
of
the
hills
drifted
across
the
quiet
evening
air
the
cows
had
gathered
against
the
paddock
fence
and
were
lowing
plaintively
for
the
evening
milking
deirdre
drove
them
into
the
yard
and
milked
when
she
had
taken
the
pails
indoors
she
went
again
to
the
road
gazed
down
into
the
darkness
that
had
now
gathered
over
the
track
and
listened
for
the
rapid
beat
of
hoofs
on
the
road
a
glimmer
of
light
in
the
shanty
windows
told
deirdre
that
steve
had
lighted
up
he
came
to
the
door
conal
late
deirdre
he
called
yes
she
replied
she
stood
there
quite
still
staring
down
the
road
what
do
you
think
can
have
kept
him
steve
had
come
out
and
was
standing
beside
her
her
face
was
very
wan
to
his
old
eyes
her
dark
hair
blew
in
tendrils
about
it
i
do
know
she
saw
the
anxiety
start
in
his
eyes
oh
it
all
right
she
took
his
arm
and
they
went
towards
the
house
again
he
be
having
a
game
of
cards
with
the
boys
it
too
soon
to
expect
him
that
all
we
go
in
and
have
supper
she
spread
the
table
and
put
out
the
hot
dinner
she
had
made
for
conal
steve
hunger
increased
at
the
savoury
smell
of
it
and
because
it
was
later
than
they
usually
had
their
meal
he
ate
steadily
and
with
ready
relish
deirdre
sat
down
at
the
table
with
him
are
you
going
to
have
anything
he
asked
when
he
saw
that
she
was
not
eating
i
wait
for
conal
she
said
steve
dozed
in
his
chair
afterwards
the
night
that
closed
in
on
the
forest
was
of
a
soft
thick
darkness
deirdre
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
out
into
it
for
while
not
a
star
hung
its
silver
lamp
over
the
hills
the
wind
crept
with
slow
uncertain
breaths
about
the
shanty
she
shut
the
door
she
carried
her
with
the
socks
that
she
had
been
mending
the
night
before
to
the
table
but
she
could
not
work
her
hands
would
not
stir
she
sat
listening
listening
listening
steve
had
taken
out
his
pipe
and
sucked
it
nodding
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
his
teeth
relaxed
their
grip
as
he
dozed
the
pipe
fell
on
the
floor
deirdre
started
to
her
feet
as
the
sound
broke
the
stillness
it
wakened
him
too
he
stared
stupidly
about
him
with
eyes
what
that
he
asked
has
conal
come
yet
no
she
said
picking
up
the
pipe
perhaps
you
better
not
wait
up
for
him
yes
yes
he
muttered
testily
of
course
i
wait
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
presently
was
sleeping
again
deirdre
went
back
to
the
table
and
sat
there
staring
before
her
listening
fixedly
hour
after
hour
went
by
a
quick
breath
crossed
her
lips
she
ran
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
a
gust
of
wind
rushed
into
the
room
and
it
brought
the
sound
of
a
horse
on
the
road
she
slammed
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
hearth
raked
the
embers
and
pulled
back
the
log
so
that
it
fell
with
a
shower
of
sparks
and
the
flames
leapt
up
over
the
new
wood
she
moved
the
pots
with
conal
dinner
in
them
nearer
the
fire
and
opening
the
door
again
stood
by
it
waiting
ginger
swung
round
the
corner
and
conal
on
her
he
was
riding
low
huddled
against
her
neck
the
way
he
dropped
from
the
saddle
drove
the
breath
from
deirdre
body
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
staggered
forward
he
would
have
fallen
if
she
had
not
been
there
to
hold
him
she
dragged
him
indoors
leaning
against
her
steve
steve
she
called
the
old
man
was
beside
her
in
an
instant
conal
had
fallen
his
legs
crumpling
up
under
him
there
was
a
stain
of
blood
on
his
clothes
deirdre
tore
them
from
the
place
where
the
blood
welled
she
put
the
brandy
steve
brought
to
conal
lips
and
sent
steve
for
water
and
rags
telling
him
where
to
find
the
soft
scraps
she
kept
together
for
burns
or
cuts
it
like
the
wound
davey
had
steve
cried
when
he
saw
the
way
the
flesh
was
ploughed
up
on
conal
breast
only
nearer
the
heart
conal
moaned
as
the
cold
water
struck
him
a
damp
sweat
lay
on
his
forehead
it
all
up
i
done
for
he
muttered
give
me
your
hand
deirdre
never
never
thought
i
reach
you
but
i
die
there
in
the
dark
down
by
the
creek
his
voice
failed
do
try
to
talk
conal
dear
she
begged
you
be
all
right
if
you
keep
quiet
lie
still
davey
was
but
there
was
a
greyness
about
conal
face
a
dimness
that
davey
had
not
had
davey
he
muttered
davey
his
eyes
opened
they
were
the
wild
bright
eyes
reckless
and
challenging
of
fighting
conal
you
believe
i
shot
davey
no
deirdre
bent
over
him
her
breath
coming
sobbingly
i
believe
it
now
conal
the
same
hands
that
did
this
to
you
did
it
to
davey
too
a
damn
whispering
slug
in
the
dark
he
gasped
it
was
by
the
culvert
over
the
creek
too
from
the
cover
of
the
trees
and
i
know
whose
hand
it
was
i
saw
the
slinking
hound
by
god
why
did
i
let
him
off
why
did
i
think
i
got
him
tight
enough
he
sank
back
against
her
arm
with
a
spasm
of
pain
she
put
the
spirit
to
his
lips
if
only
i
choked
the
life
out
of
him
i
could
die
easy
but
the
mare
bolted
i
could
get
her
back
to
him
the
lying
cur
the
bargain
was
made
i
thought
i
got
him
that
he
made
over
his
last
penny
to
me
someone
kept
me
talking
outside
the
bull
it
was
that
kid
minds
his
horses
saying
that
ginger
gone
lame
and
the
next
thing
was
a
shot
from
the
creek
and
mcnab
scuttling
among
the
trees
paugh
he
moved
impatiently
why
did
i
do
for
him
while
i
had
the
chance
superhuman
strength
animating
him
for
a
moment
he
struggled
up
his
swart
face
stiffening
his
eyes
flashing
i
can
i
alive
yet
i
can
deirdre
he
swayed
and
she
caught
him
breaking
the
shock
of
his
fall
backwards
blood
welled
from
the
open
wound
the
wet
pads
had
staunched
the
flow
for
a
moment
steve
brought
more
water
she
dipped
fresh
linen
and
rags
in
it
and
bound
them
into
place
conal
lay
heavy
and
still
she
bent
over
him
her
eyes
turned
questioningly
to
steve
she
lifted
conal
head
on
to
her
knees
the
silence
was
unbroken
conal
she
whispered
as
though
she
were
calling
him
conal
that
you
deirdre
he
asked
huskily
but
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
if
if
you
could
kiss
me
it
so
hard
to
go
feeling
you
near
and
that
you
do
care
for
me
at
all
if
only
i
had
failed
you
this
time
if
only
but
it
was
because
of
you
i
did
want
to
kill
him
unless
unless
it
was
necessary
it
seemed
all
right
the
other
way
you
wo
think
badly
of
me
deirdre
no
no
conal
dear
but
do
try
to
talk
now
i
been
hard
on
you
deirdre
but
you
wo
think
ill
of
me
it
the
way
men
are
made
and
i
did
understand
how
it
was
with
you
and
davey
not
till
that
night
in
the
hut
if
i
had
brought
trouble
between
you
you
might
forgive
me
conal
conal
deirdre
sobbed
the
tears
streaming
over
her
face
you
dear
to
me
yourself
dear
in
your
own
way
have
you
always
been
and
i
have
been
good
to
you
always
my
heart
breaking
to
hear
you
talk
like
this
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
conal
opened
his
eyes
the
mellow
light
of
serene
happiness
had
drifted
into
them
they
rested
on
her
face
as
though
they
were
loath
to
leave
it
his
long
fingers
were
knotted
about
her
hands
i
happier
than
ever
i
was
in
my
life
deirdre
darling
he
whispered
she
had
to
stoop
over
him
to
catch
the
words
on
his
lips
so
faint
and
hoarsely
uttered
they
were
as
though
the
thoughts
left
him
without
his
lips
having
power
to
form
them
never
expected
to
put
my
head
on
your
knees
hold
your
hand
like
this
it
would
never
have
happened
if
i
lived
so
it
good
to
die
you
look
after
ginger
for
pluck
dear
old
devil
never
got
here
but
for
her
and
sally
good
old
sally
not
a
cattle
mong
like
her
countryside
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
over
his
lips
if
only
recollection
of
mcnab
came
banishing
the
peaceful
happiness
from
his
face
his
eyes
blazed
there
was
a
momentary
struggle
for
breath
and
he
fell
back
fighting
for
life
then
on
a
long
sigh
he
was
still
deirdre
tried
the
brandy
again
she
called
him
she
felt
for
his
heart
his
head
was
very
heavy
on
her
knees
she
stared
down
on
the
finely
chiselled
features
so
still
upraised
before
her
her
tears
rained
over
them
the
quiet
was
unbroken
but
for
steve
crying
like
a
child
then
sally
lying
crouched
against
the
door
of
the
hut
lifted
her
voice
in
a
long
mournful
howl
that
told
the
shrouded
hills
and
all
the
creatures
of
them
that
the
soul
of
her
master
long
conal
conal
the
fighter
had
passed
on
chapter
xlv
deirdre
knew
that
mcnab
would
not
come
near
steve
while
the
dead
body
of
conal
lay
there
in
the
morning
she
saddled
the
chestnut
and
rode
into
wirreeford
it
was
you
shot
conal
and
i
going
to
let
all
the
countryside
know
it
she
said
facing
mcnab
in
the
reeking
parlour
of
the
black
bull
and
who
do
y
think
will
believe
you
mcnab
sidled
up
to
her
his
eyes
kindling
everybody
who
knows
you
and
they
say
to
you
do
y
know
proof
have
you
got
deirdre
nobody
want
to
go
agen
thad
mcnab
lest
they
sure
and
nobody
want
to
be
gettin
up
and
givin
evidence
against
mcnab
lest
they
sure
they
comin
out
on
the
right
side
of
the
business
proof
there
proof
enough
deirdre
voice
rang
clear
though
her
heart
was
beginning
to
quail
she
knew
that
what
he
said
was
true
she
had
come
with
the
idea
of
using
conal
death
as
a
weapon
against
mcnab
but
it
had
suddenly
become
empty
and
useless
in
her
hands
now
look
here
my
dear
it
no
use
bein
nasty
mcnab
said
you
know
and
i
know
there
no
man
in
the
wirree
would
go
against
me
he
was
pretty
sure
of
getting
somebody
stronger
than
himself
to
back
him
well
is
he
going
to
get
anybody
that
the
question
deirdre
thought
of
sodden
with
drink
and
as
much
creature
as
any
other
man
in
the
wirree
mcnab
chuckled
though
there
was
a
nervous
edge
to
his
voice
there
sergeant
of
course
he
police
officer
for
the
district
you
can
tell
him
your
story
if
you
like
but
he
a
man
he
want
proofs
and
then
do
forget
i
still
the
trump
card
up
me
sleeve
her
immobility
maddened
him
see
here
deirdre
he
said
shaking
with
rage
i
been
patient
with
you
till
now
and
i
not
a
patient
man
y
may
not
liked
the
ways
of
my
but
they
my
ways

take
my
terms
or
you
leave
them
and
if
you

any
more
jackanapes
to
me

find
them
served
as

conal
maybe

waitin
and
hopin

rasped
on
to
to
help

my
way
again
deirdre
let
him
if
he
gets
in
my
way
he
have
to
get
out
of
it
or
you
will
have
to
get
out
of
his
way
deirdre
eyes
flashed
into
his
she
saw
the
mean
cunning
soul
in
them
she
knew
that
it
would
be
davey
who
would
get
out
that
there
was
no
fighting
mcnab
davey
would
die
as
conal
had
died
of
a
shot
in
the
dark
or
a
stab
in
the
back
mcnab
realised
that
she
had
measured
his
chances
against
davey
cameron
davey
chances
against
him
in
that
moment
for
all
her
proud
look
there
a
boat
just
in
the
port
takin
on
some
cattle
brought
news
from
melbourne
he
said
davey

is
the
schoolmaster
jury
did
find
there
was
evidence
enough
to
convict

coming
along
by
the
she

a
couple
of
days
johnson
cameron

and
steve
along
with
it
it
goes
right
on
to
hobart
town
after
calling
here
deirdre
stumbled
out
of
the
room
mcnab
did
not
follow
her
he
knew
that
she
would
not
fight
any
more
he
watched
her
swing
into
her
saddle
and
ride
out
along
the
flat
road
to
the
hills
mary
ann
driving
a
string
of
geese
along
the
green
ledges
of
the
wayside
called
to
her
but
deirdre
fled
on
past
the
cottage
that
the
schoolmaster
and
she
had
lived
in
past
the
of
gorse
beginning
to
bud
goldenly
on
the
edge
of
the
plains
and
mcnab
chuckled
softly
rubbing
his
hands
together
chapter
xlvi
the
was
in
just
before
midday
carts
and
had
clattered
along
the
road
to
the
port
deirdre
riding
down
from
the
hills
at
dawn
had
seen
the
schooner
on
the
dim
shining
screen
of
sea
and
sky
there
was
no
wind
and
like
a
great
white
bird
she
hovered
outside
the
bar
waiting
for
the
wind
and
tide
to
carry
her
into
the
quiet
waters
of
the
inlet
it
was
not
until
midday
that
a
breeze
sprang
up
sending
white
curled
breakers
high
over
the
bar
and
the
on
the
crest
of
them
came
sailing
into
the
harbour
she
rode
furling
her
sails
to
the
wharf
on
its
further
side
a
crowd
had
gathered
to
meet
her
and
it
was
early
afternoon
before
the
vehicles
began
to
rattle
back
along
the
road
to
the
hills
and
wirreeford
deirdre
stood
at
the
window
of
mcnab
parlour
behind
the
curtains
that
had
been
hung
up
in
her
honour
watching
them
she
saw
none
of
the
curious
looks
and
gestures
that
went
her
way
the
pitiful
glances
that
covered
her
for
the
news
of
the
port
that
morning
beat
any
the
boat
had
brought
those
who
saw
the
dim
white
face
of
the
girl
at
the
window
and
her
shadowy
eyes
knew
that
she
was
thad
wife
they
knew
that
mcnab
had
driven
deirdre
farrel
into
the
port
before
any
of
them
were
astir
and
that
a
clergyman
had
married
them
in
the
church
there
why
did
she
do
it
what
could
have
made
her
they
asked
each
other
it
was
for
love
of
his
beautiful
face
be
sure
snarled
salt
watson
it
hard
on
the
schoolmaster
he
not
know
of
it
yet
somebody
else
said
deirdre
neither
heard
nor
saw
them
she
was
watching
for
davey
and
dan
to
pass
she
had
seen
ross
and
jessie
go
by
to
the
port
in
cameron
buggy
she
thought
they
would
ride
together
to
the
hills
in
that
davey
and
her
father
if
they
knew
they
would
stop
at
the
black
bull
if
no
one
had
told
them
they
would
go
on
she
had
decided
they
would
wonder
why
she
was
not
on
the
wharf
when
the
boat
got
in
to
meet
them
but
mcnab
would
not
have
that
he
would
not
lose
sight
of
her
besides
she
did
not
want
to
meet
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
women
who
would
be
there
and
hear
what
they
had
to
say
she
was
cut
off
from
the
world
as
she
stood
at
the
window
of
house
her
mind
was
too
utterly
weary
to
reason
further
as
she
watched
and
waited
a
sense
of
bleak
desolation
closed
in
on
her
her
eyes
ached
for
sight
of
the
schoolmaster
form
against
the
clear
sky
although
she
knew
she
would
hardly
see
it
above
the
buggy
and
among
other
people
she
asked
herself
what
he
would
do
when
he
found
that
she
was
not
waiting
for
him
at
steve
what
he
would
think
when
he
found
the
letter
that
was
lying
for
him
there
steve
would
have
to
read
it
for
him
it
would
break
his
heart
the
letter
that
she
had
wept
and
prayed
over
but
it
was
better
that
his
heart
should
break
than
that
he
should
go
to
the
island
again
and
steve
poor
old
steve
would
die
in
peace
some
day
and
be
put
to
rest
where
they
had
put
conal
a
magistrate
assisted
in
a
fashion
by
and
a
jury
had
duly
investigated
and
found
that
his
tragic
death
was
an
impenetrable
mystery
an
open
verdict
they
called
the
finding
conal
resting
place
was
on
a
sunny
hillside
under
a
blossoming
white
gum
in
which
the
bees
hummed
drowsily
in
the
spring
time
and
through
which
the
green
parrots
flashed
all
the
year
it
was
good
to
think
that
steve
would
draw
his
last
breath
in
freedom
and
then
sleep
there
under
the
blue
sky
but
for
her
there
would
be
no
freedom
no
open
spaces
life
had
become
a
prison
from
which
there
was
only
one
gate
death
and
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
open
because
she
was
a
hostage
for
other
lives
dan
and
steve
perhaps
davey
cameron
buggy
rounded
a
turn
in
the
road
ross
and
jessie
were
in
it
and
there
was
a
man
figure
beside
theirs
only
one
though
the
horse
moving
at
her
slow
steady
drew
nearer
deirdre
saw
clearly
the
man
who
was
driving
it
was
davey
the
schoolmaster
was
not
with
him
a
panic
seized
her
she
flew
out
to
the
road
the
horse
stopped
automatically
where
father
she
cried
davey
stared
at
her
he
scarcely
knew
her
this
wild
creature
with
burning
eyes
and
colourless
lips
has
he
come
she
asked
no
he
said
slowly
he
got
down
from
the
buggy
his
heart
ached
at
the
sight
of
her
he
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
he
moved
to
take
her
hands
she
shrank
from
him
why
did
he
come
because
oh
deirdre
it
breaks
my
heart
to
tell
you
he
broke
out
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
did
all
i
could
but
it
was
no
good
some
cursed
brute
gave
information
oh
she
whispered
it
was
that
then
and
after
a
moment
they
took
him
again
for
being
at
large
before
the
expiration
of
sentence
yes
his
eyes
were
all
tenderness
and
pity
for
her
when
davey
just
before
we
were
leaving
four
days
ago
do
look
like
that
deirdre
i
wo
leave
a
stone
unturned
to
get
him
back
and
i
promised
him
that
we
she
laughed
a
strange
cracking
little
laugh
deirdre
he
was
perplexed
and
hurt
do
come
near
me
she
turned
away
from
him
and
ran
into
the
house
under
the
swinging
sign
of
the
black
bull
with
eyes
davey
attempted
to
follow
her
he
saw
mcnab
in
the
doorway
what
the
hell
she
doing
there
he
muttered
ross
and
jessie
eyed
each
other
anxiously
they
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
then
the
elder
woman
said
nervously
uncertainly
she
came
down
with
steve
to
meet
the
schoolmaster
but
we
better
be
going
on
davey
do
risk
any
trouble
with
thad
mcnab
your
mother
waiting
eagerly
for
you
you
her
only
thought
now
all
she
has
got
davey
climbed
into
the
buggy
again
his
face
was
sombre
he
had
not
got
over
the
shock
of
his
father
death
and
deirdre
manner
wounded
and
bewildered
him
he
thought
that
she
was
distraught
with
agony
and
disappointment
on
the
schoolmaster
account
he
had
imagined
how
tenderly
he
would
tell
her
what
had
happened
and
comfort
her
now
to
find
her
at
the
black
bull
not
at
steve
where
he
had
thought
she
would
be
and
ross
and
jessie
beside
him
when
he
wanted
to
fold
her
in
his
arms
and
assure
her
that
he
would
never
rest
until
dan
was
with
them
again
he
swore
at
every
jolt
and
jar
on
the
road
to
relieve
his
impatience
it
was
ross
who
said
to
mary
cameron
taking
her
aside
when
mother
and
son
had
met
and
davey
was
turning
bess
into
the
paddock
again
it
true
what
we
heard
about
deirdre
farrel
going
to
marry
mcnab
she
was
married
to
him
this
morning
you
better
break
the
news
to
davey
he
does
know
yet
i
durs
tell
him
for
fear
he
go
to
mcnab
i
wanted
to
bring
him
safe
to
you
jessie
and
i
go
home
now
no
doubt
you
like
to
have
the
house
to
yourself
but
if
you
want
anything
or
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
we
always
glad
to
do
anything
for
you
cameron
dear
jessie
said
softly
it
a
queer
heartless
girl
deirdre
is
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
love
of
a
fine
fellow
like
davey
ross
said
when
jess
was
outside
setting
their
bundles
and
baskets
into
the
cart
oh
she
would
do
that
deirdre
cameron
replied
something
dreadful
that
driven
her
to
it
yes
i
suppose
it
is
ross
sighed
poor
child
perhaps
spiteful
about
it
mary
but
maybe
now
that
she
is
out
of
the
way
davey
may
think
of
my
jessie
again
davey
s
mother
smiled
sadly
i
be
sorry
for
any
woman
he
married
but
deirdre
for
she
has
the
whole
of
him
heart
and
soul
she
said
oh
well
it
a
pity
ross
kissed
her
jess
had
better
make
up
her
mind
to
have
buddy
morrison
then
and
that
what
i
been
telling
her
this
long
time
he
a
good
lad
very
fond
of
her
and
been
wanting
to
marry
her
for
the
last
five
years
when
jess
and
her
mother
had
gone
driving
off
in
their
high
jolting
buggy
davey
and
cameron
went
indoors
together
he
had
aged
considerable
since
she
last
saw
him
it
was
a
stern
strange
face
to
her
this
her
boy
there
were
sorrow
a
bitter
realisation
of
life
and
what
it
means
in
heartache
and
disappointment
in
his
expression
something
of
power
and
assurance
too
she
was
wondering
how
she
could
tell
him
covering
him
with
tender
pitiful
glances
and
praying
that
he
would
not
leave
her
that
no
hurt
might
come
to
him
when
he
asked
suddenly
have
you
seen
anything
of
deirdre
mother
he
had
been
moving
restlessly
about
the
room
lifting
things
from
their
place
on
the
mantelpiece
and
putting
them
back
again
she
called
him
to
her
and
putting
her
hands
on
his
head
told
him
what
ross
had
said
davey
face
hardened
and
whitened
slowly
he
put
her
hands
away
from
him
and
wheeled
unsteadily
from
the
room
she
heard
him
go
across
the
yard
and
saw
him
stumbling
up
the
narrow
track
to
the
trees
on
the
far
side
of
the
hill
chapter
xlvii
cameron
was
feeding
her
chickens
when
she
thought
she
heard
someone
calling
she
listened
and
decided
that
it
was
only
a
whispering
of
wind
in
the
trees
that
had
caught
her
ear
the
mild
light
of
the
evening
lingered
about
her
her
eyes
lay
on
the
hill
that
rose
with
a
gentle
slope
beyond
the
yard
the
barns
and
stable
and
a
score
of
brushwood
sheds
mists
were
beginning
to
gather
among
the
trees
that
fringed
the
top
on
either
side
davey
had
gone
up
among
those
trees
the
sound
of
her
name
called
faintly
again
disturbed
her
she
looked
down
towards
the
road
that
wound
uphill
out
of
the
forest
it
was
in
the
twilight
the
long
white
gate
that
barred
it
from
the
paddock
about
the
house
growing
dim
the
gum
saplings
of
two
or
three
years
growth
with
their
leaves
pressing
on
the
far
side
of
the
fence
behind
the
barn
shivered
as
the
surface
of
still
water
shivers
when
something
stirs
beneath
it
her
eyes
were
directed
towards
the
centre
of
the
almost
imperceptible
movement
someone
called
her
faintly
whisperingly
going
towards
the
fence
she
saw
a
wan
face
and
wide
eyes
among
the
leaves
the
lines
of
a
long
dark
dress
went
off
into
the
shadows
among
the
trees
deirdre
she
cried
the
girl
came
towards
her
her
dress
was
draggled
and
torn
there
was
a
red
line
on
her
cheek
where
a
broken
branch
had
caught
and
scratched
it
where
davey
she
asked
deirdre
what
has
happened
cameron
recognised
a
tragic
urgency
in
her
face
come
in
you
exhausted
you
do
mean
to
say
walked
from
the
wirree
she
took
her
hand
and
led
her
into
the
kitchen
the
fire
was
sending
long
ruddy
beams
of
light
over
the
bricked
floor
glimmering
on
the
rows
of
polished
metal
covers
on
the
walls
and
the
crockery
on
the
wooden
dresser
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
it
was
very
homely
and
peaceful
cameron
kitchen
she
pushed
deirdre
gently
into
the
big
by
the
fire
sit
there
dearie
till
i
get
you
a
hot
drink
she
said
deirdre
sat
very
still
gazing
before
her
it
this
marriage
with
mcnab
is
too
much
for
her
cameron
thought
oh
child
why
did
you
do
it
what
could
have
driven
you
to
it
she
asked
the
shadow
of
a
slow
and
subtle
smile
crept
for
a
moment
about
lips
and
vanished
again
if
only
you
have
told
me
your
trouble
cameron
cried
i
might
have
been
able
to
help
you
oh
no
you
would
deirdre
said
you
could
have
married
mcnab
for
any
reason
of
choice
cameron
was
torn
between
grief
bewilderment
and
compassion
davey
is
breaking
his
heart
about
it
out
on
the
hills
somewhere
now
i
had
to
tell
him
when
he
came
in
for
fear
what
to
be
done
about
it
deirdre
oh
not
wanting
to
blame
you
you
did
it
for
a
good
reason
i
sure
and
you
love
davey
it
hard
on
you
deirdre
you
do
love
him
yes
deirdre
said
slowly
cameron
knelt
beside
the
chair
her
hands
trembled
on
the
arm
do
touch
me
deirdre
gasped
moving
out
of
the
reach
of
her
hands
do
touch
me
she
whispered
again
eyeing
her
strangely
davey
i
afraid
what
he
do
if
he
sees
you
cameron
hesitated
deirdre
sprang
out
of
the
chair
her
eyes
blazing
davey
davey
it
all
davey
with
you
she
cried
you
sacrificed
father
to
him
you
sent
him
to
that
trial
i
know
now
and
davey
why
could
he
have
gone
to
gaol
instead
he
young
and
strong
and
it
would
have
mattered
so
much
to
him
he
got
all
his
life
before
him
but
father
had
he
done
enough
for
you
has
he
given
his
eyes
for
you
has
he
worshipped
you
all
these
years
i
seen
it
since
i
was
a
child
and
is
this
all
you
could
do
for
him
send
him
to
the
law
courts
to
get
davey
off
knowing
that
it
would
be
worse
than
death
to
him
to
have
to
go
to
prison
again
oh
you
knew
what
he
have
to
suffer
in
davey
place
cameron
put
her
hands
over
her
face
you
knew
he
could
afford
to
come
under
the
notice
of
the
law
deirdre
said
but
i
should
talk
like
this
her
voice
trailed
wearily
only
i
had
to
choose
between
father
and
davey
mcnab
knows
all
the
old
story
you
do
i
know
steve
told
me
mcnab
scared
the
wits
out
of
steve
one
day
when
he
was
by
himself
and
got
all
the
proofs
he
wanted
though
he
seems
to
have
had
the
facts
most
of
them
anyway
before
then
he
told
me
what
being
at
large
before
the
expiration
of
sentence
meant
and
what
his
information
would
do
if
he
used
it
about
father
when
the
trial
was
on
he
said
that
he
would
use
it
if
i
marry
him
cameron
stared
at
her
deirdre
went
on
her
voice
dragging
as
if
she
could
scarcely
put
into
words
the
pain
and
trouble
of
her
mind
i
could
let
father
suffer
any
more
i
could
bear
to
think
what
it
would
be
for
him
to
go
back
there
to
the
island
she
said
he
blind
and
loving
me
so
and
you
and
both
of
us
willing
to
sacrifice
him
to
davey
i
could
see
him
going
over
there
hurt
and
alone
in
the
dark
the
dear
great
gentle
heart
of
him
crying
crying
for
those
he
loved
to
be
near
him
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
voices
to
touch
their
hands
i
could
endure
it
oh
i
could
her
head
dropped
he
has
made
sacrifices
all
his
life
his
eyes
for
you
do
say
that
deirdre
it
the
truth
the
girl
said
fiercely
that
night
of
the
fixes
he
saw
the
branch
falling
it
would
have
hit
you
if
he
had
not
put
up
his
arm
and
it
came
down
on
him
on
his
face
all
the
embers
cameron
uttered
a
low
cry
and
now
at
the
end
of
his
days
you
took
this
last
scrap
of
freedom
from
him
but
i
would
have
it
i
knew
that
the
time
had
come
for
somebody
to
do
something
for
him
there
was
a
few
moments
silence
only
after
all
a
weary
bitterness
surged
in
her
voice
it
was
no
good
mcnab
was
too
clever
for
me
he
trapped
me
and
sold
father
all
the
same
and
steve
poor
old
stevie
too
took
him
down
to
the
port
this
afternoon
i
heard
him
crying
like
a
baby
when
i
asked
mcnab
why
he
had
broken
his
word
to
me
he
said
a
little
sick
laughter
struggled
from
her
that
blind
as
father
was
he
knew
he
have
to
reckon
with
him
for
having
taken
me
if
he
ever
came
back
to
the
wirree
she
sank
back
in
the
chair
shivering
and
sobbing
cameron
leant
towards
her
do
touch
me
deirdre
shrank
from
her
i
have
told
you
all
yet
mcnab
locked
me
in
a
room
when
he
knew
that
i
knew
what
he
done
it
was
when
he
came
to
me
there
and
called
me
his
wife
i
killed
him
cameron
fell
back
from
her
oh
i
did
mean
to
kill
him
the
girl
cried
distractedly
he
came
near
me
i
told
him
not
to
but
he
did
he
talked
of
his
rights
i
hit
at
him
to
keep
him
away
from
me
with
something
that
was
lying
on
the
table
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
it
was
heavy
and
he
fell
down
i
knew
he
was
dead
by
the
way
he
lay
there
without
moving
and
then
i
ran
out
of
the
room
and
came
here
oh
i
did
mean
to
do
it
but
not
sorry
it
done
that
he
is
dead
and
can
do
no
more
harm
to
any
of
us
he
killed
conal
and
it
was
he
that
shot
at
davey
he
would
have
again
too
he
was
afraid
of
davey
what
he
would
do
when
he
found
out
about
father
and
me
she
was
sobbing
breathlessly
her
hands
went
out
before
her
with
a
desperate
despairing
gesture
she
moved
towards
the
door
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
going
to
do
deirdre
cameron
followed
her
i
do
know
the
girl
stood
quivering
by
the
doorpost
only
i
must
go
they
may
come
from
the
wirree
and
find
me
here
and
i
do
want
to
be
hanged
that
what
they
do
with
people
who
have
done
what
i
done
is
it
i
want
to
go
davey
must
see
me
it
no
good
no
good
there
would
be
the
great
gulf
between
us
always
and
as
long
as
i
lived
to
the
day
of
my
death
i
be
on
the
other
side
of
it
with
my
arms
out
to
him
oh
you
must
keep
me
ca
you
see
it
best
that
i
should
go
now
like
this
before
you
not
thinking
of
doing
any
harm
to
yourself
deirdre
the
anguished
eyes
of
the
woman
beside
her
reached
the
girl
through
the
maze
and
terror
of
her
thoughts
they
calmed
the
tumult
within
her
the
long
gully
she
said
simply
wearily
the
mists
are
so
deep
in
it
and
there
would
be
no
waking
in
the
morning
cameron
took
her
hand
you
say
i
never
done
anything
for
your
father
deirdre
i
want
to
do
something
for
him
now
come
back
and
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
she
led
the
girl
back
to
the
chair
and
forced
her
into
it
but
they
be
coming
for
me
soon
deirdre
cried
fretfully
looking
back
at
the
door
she
hardly
heard
what
cameron
was
saying
for
awhile
her
tired
bright
eyes
wandered
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
the
pain
in
her
head
prevented
her
thinking
deirdre
darling
cameron
said
her
voice
trembling
there
not
a
man
or
woman
in
the
country
would
not
say
you
were
justified
and
no
woman
is
better
able
to
understand
than
i
am
i
not
afraid
for
you
and
there
no
one
i
rather
have
for
davey
wife
than
you
you
were
willing
to
sacrifice
yourself
but
when
treachery
had
been
proved
against
you
there
was
that
within
you
would
not
let
evil
come
near
you
do
you
mean
you
be
satisfied
for
davey
to
have
me
deirdre
asked
yes
cameron
eyes
were
on
hers
you
not
be
throwing
it
up
at
me
that
i
that
i
did
this
deirdre
inquired
and
that
father
no
cameron
voice
was
very
low
because
if
i
had
been
served
as
your
father
was
i
have
been
a
convict
too
in
the
shock
of
what
she
had
said
deirdre
forgot
her
own
trouble
you
she
whispered
that
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
it
been
locked
in
my
heart
so
long
and
nobody
else
knows
cameron
said
it
because
i
think
it
may
help
you
deirdre
now
that
your
soul
is
in
the
deep
waters
i
want
you
to
know
that
something
like
what
has
happened
to
you
happened
to
me
long
ago
only
i
had
less
excuse
her
face
was
torn
with
grief
she
turned
from
the
girl
overwhelmed
by
the
of
dark
memories
oh
i
ca
think
of
it
without
all
the
agony
again
she
cried
and
after
a
moment
continued
i
did
want
to
bring
shame
on
my
people
by
having
it
known
i
had
been
the
cause
of
death
to
a
man
but
the
weight
was
on
my
soul
i
had
heard
of
people
escaping
public
trial
by
condemning
themselves
to
transportation
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
have
any
peace
of
mind
i
thought
taking
on
myself
the
punishment
other
women
had
got
for
doing
what
i
did
but
it
was
never
as
bad
for
me
as
for
them
davey
father
saw
me
on
the
wharf
among
the
emigrant
women
and
he
wanted
to
marry
me
there
was
a
government
bounty
thirty
pounds
i
think
it
was
given
to
married
couples
coming
to
the
colony
and
he
wanted
the
money
to
begin
with
in
the
new
country
i
told
him
why
i
was
going
out
and
he
was
willing
to
take
me
there
were
terrible
days
of
fear
among
all
the
rough
people
i
found
myself
with
till
he
came
i
was
grateful
to
him
and
swore
to
be
a
good
and
faithful
wife
to
him
i
not
spoken
of
this
since
then
deirdre
i
telling
you
because
i
want
you
not
to
throw
your
life
away
not
to
waste
it
i
know
i
was
wrong
there
was
this
difference
between
what
you
did
and
what
i
did
i
was
not
in
a
corner
fighting
for
my
life
as
you
were
i
did
not
mean
to
take
life
i
did
not
mean
to
it
was
an
accident
really
right
was
on
my
side
but
i
was
angry
or
the
accident
would
never
have
happened
i
have
suffered
from
knowing
that
all
these
years
have
made
little
difference
that
why
i
was
always
wanting
to
help
convicts
and
prisoners
in
the
old
days
and
it
angered
davey
father
so
i
felt
that
they
were
suffering
what
i
ought
to
have
been
suffering
too
but
with
you
it
was
different
your
own
instinct
tells
you
the
difference
it
does
not
accuse
you
no
one
else
will
either
and
there
your
father
to
think
of
it
would
take
the
last
gleam
of
happiness
from
him
to
know
you
had
ended
your
own
life
deirdre
and
there
davey
and
me
to
love
you
and
care
for
you
always
deirdre
stared
at
her
then
the
tears
came
she
cried
quietly
cameron
put
her
arms
round
her
she
comforted
her
with
tender
little
murmurings
deirdre
raised
her
head
and
put
her
off
from
her
gazing
into
her
face
with
drenched
eyes
i
understand
ever
so
much
better
now
she
said
and
a
moment
later
have
i
been
mad
with
fright
what
i
do
my
head
aches
so
i
scarcely
know
what
i
am
saying
i
ca
think
what
shall
i
do
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
there
no
jury
in
the
country
that
would
not
acquit
you
cameron
said
mcnab
was
well
known
oh
people
were
afraid
of
him
but
they
will
speak
now
you
young
and
beautiful
and
if
your
story
is
not
a
justification
there
no
god
watching
over
the
world
but
what
will
davey
think
of
me
deirdre
cried
i
afraid
to
see
him
i
wanted
to
when
i
came
here
but
i
afraid
now
i
thought
it
would
be
to
say
they
be
coming
for
me
soon
too
oh
go
now
cameron
if
davey
looked
at
my
hands
and
knew
what
they
had
done
conflicting
thoughts
whipping
each
other
were
driving
her
like
a
leaf
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
there
was
a
heavy
step
on
the
threshold
davey
figure
loomed
against
the
doorway
coming
in
from
the
light
it
was
a
few
minutes
before
his
eyes
accustomed
to
the
gloom
saw
that
there
was
someone
with
his
mother
he
stared
at
deirdre
as
though
they
were
ghosts
who
were
meeting
after
death
beyond
the
world
she
shrank
from
the
stare
of
his
eyes
putting
up
her
arms
to
hide
her
face
with
a
little
pitiful
cry
she
moved
along
the
wall
towards
the
door
as
if
to
go
out
and
escape
them
davey
davey
do
let
her
go
cameron
cried
although
his
eyes
followed
her
and
he
seemed
to
guess
her
intention
he
did
not
stir
davey
cameron
cried
a
pang
in
her
heart
like
the
blade
of
a
knife
she
has
killed
mcnab
and
is
going
to
her
death
because
of
it
deirdre
stood
still
her
arms
dropped
from
her
face
she
threw
back
her
head
her
eyes
met
his
unflinchingly
you
you
have
killed
him
his
voice
was
harsh
with
the
effort
to
speak
yes
she
said
a
gust
of
passion
rushed
over
him
it
flooded
him
with
a
vigour
and
exultation
that
transformed
him
he
strode
towards
her
his
arms
imprisoned
her
he
held
her
and
kissed
her
with
the
hungry
kiss
of
a
lover
long
denied
deirdre
deirdre
he
sobbed
that
you
should
have
it
was
for
me
to
do
that
i
meant
to
do
you
think
i
could
have
lived
breathed
been
sane
while
you
were
near
him
he
crushed
her
in
his
arms
again
they
sobbed
together
childishly
cameron
went
into
the
other
room
her
with
its
shiny
black
furniture
and
the
cupboard
in
which
her
spinning
wheel
had
stood
since
the
days
of
donald
cameron
greatness
the
beloved
blue
vase
that
she
had
saved
from
the
fire
was
still
on
the
chiffonier
she
sat
in
the
room
she
had
been
so
proud
of
a
long
time
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
reviewing
her
memories
they
came
in
straggling
lines
and
phalanxes
memories
of
her
youth
of
an
old
sad
time
of
her
voyage
across
the
seas
beside
donald
cameron
of
their
journey
into
the
hills
of
the
days
of
struggle
and
toil
and
domestic
tranquility
that
had
given
her
a
son
of
her
first
fear
and
loneliness
in
the
silent
world
of
the
trees
and
of
the
gaunt
men
who
had
come
to
her
out
of
them
the
complexities
of
human
emotion
were
a
mystery
and
a
distress
to
her
she
had
the
momentary
vision
of
a
prison
yard
its
grim
walls
trains
of
sullen
men
in
grimy
grey
and
yellow
clothes
all
of
the
same
pattern
and
of
one
who
walked
among
them
wearily
a
little
uncertainly
singing
faintly
as
she
had
often
heard
him
singing
on
the
hill
roads
her
eyes
went
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
the
spot
under
the
trees
where
donald
cameron
had
been
laid
to
rest
her
heart
crying
an
assurance
of
loyalty
and
fidelity
to
the
yoke
mate
they
had
set
a
seed
in
the
country
that
would
bear
fruit
in
the
union
of
the
two
in
the
next
room
she
knew
all
the
labour
of
their
pioneering
had
not
been
in
vain
donald
cameron
had
done
what
he
set
out
to
do
though
his
last
days
had
been
darkened
with
disappointment
the
bitter
sense
of
disgrace
and
the
futility
of
all
his
long
years
of
toil
but
his
name
would
go
on
she
realised
and
his
children
children
would
talk
with
pride
of
their
grandfather
who
had
come
from
the
old
country
a
poor
man
and
had
made
a
great
name
for
himself
in
the
new
land
of
the
spiritual
undertow
which
bound
deirdre
and
davey
she
could
not
think
that
was
entwined
with
the
subtle
inexplicable
currents
of
her
own
soul
she
had
turned
her
face
from
them
shut
her
eyes
and
ears
to
the
sight
and
sound
of
them
she
had
never
allowed
herself
to
recognise
their
existence
even
yet
she
knew
that
they
were
there
rushing
on
silently
irresistibly
into
eternity
a
vision
of
the
prison
yard
came
again
shaping
itself
slowly
vaguely
and
with
it
a
sound
of
chains
the
harsh
voices
of
warders
and
gaolers
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
lovers
in
the
other
room
she
folded
her
hands
with
a
little
passionate
gesture
the
light
of
her
whole
soul
shone
in
her
eyes
oh
god
she
whispered
breathlessly
we
broke
the
earth
we
sowed
the
seed
let
theirs
be
the
harvest
the
joy
of
life
and
the
fullness
thereof
chapter
xlviii
fifteen
years
after
a
boy
pushed
the
bracken
and
ferny
grey
and
green
wattle
sprays
from
before
a
wooden
cross
he
was
a
sturdy
youngster
with
an
eager
sensitive
face
and
dropped
on
one
knee
beside
the
mound
the
parted
ferns
and
branches
revealed
to
read
the
inscription
on
the
cross
the
path
that
wound
uphill
through
the
trees
behind
him
was
an
old
one
overgrown
with
mosses
scraps
of
bark
and
sear
leaves
were
matted
across
it
the
weathered
rambling
homestead
of
ayrmuir
was
just
visible
through
the
trees
and
a
cornfield
waving
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
showed
golden
through
a
gap
in
the
waving
leafage
donald
cameron
had
marked
the
place
long
before
and
said
that
there
where
the
wagon
had
come
to
a
standstill
he
must
be
laid
to
rest
and
it
was
within
memory
of
the
boy
that
his
grandmother
mary
cameron
had
been
laid
beside
him
a
voice
floating
down
the
hillside
from
the
house
called
dan
dan
deirdre
came
down
the
path
towards
him
an
older
graver
deirdre
with
peace
in
her
eyes
though
an
undefinable
shadow
rested
on
her
face
here
you
are
dear
she
said
it
be
time
to
be
getting
ready
soon
mick
has
the
horses
in
and
your
father
wo
like
to
be
kept
waiting
there
was
so
much
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
too
before
you
go
up
to
this
big
school
it
wo
be
a
bit
like
going
to
the
school
down
here
or
doing
latin
with
me
going
to
the
grammar
school
dan
no
of
course
mother
i
wonder
sometimes
if
i
been
wrong
to
keep
you
so
much
with
me
she
said
wistfully
you
had
to
be
told
all
the
terrible
old
story
i
told
you
myself
because
i
wanted
you
to
understand
mother
there
were
reverence
and
adoration
in
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
her
you
sure
sure
you
do
feel
strange
about
your
mother
dan
she
asked
a
jury
acquitted
me
but
i
know
i
was
right
myself
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
was
quivering
to
the
shock
of
startled
memories
i
ca
feel
that
i
could
have
done
anything
else
than
i
did
she
cried
passionately
but
i
ca
forget
dan
the
horror
of
it
all
shadows
me
still
it
always
will
the
boy
slipped
his
arms
through
hers
and
pressed
against
her
whenever
i
read
in
history
or
a
story
of
people
who
had
to
do
terrible
things
for
those
they
loved
i
think
my
mother
but
no
one
ever
read
or
heard
of
was
like
you
he
said
shyly
dan
a
smile
of
melting
eager
tenderness
suffused
her
eyes
as
they
turned
away
he
looked
back
at
the
grave
under
the
trees
i
thought
i
like
to
say
to
them
he
said
they
were
pioneers
were
they
grandfather
and
grandmother
makes
me
feel
like
being
a
bit
of
history
myself
to
think
that
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
were
pioneers
i
was
saying
to
myself
just
now
did
so
much
against
such
big
odds
what
a
lot
i
ought
to
be
able
to
do
with
everything
made
easy
for
me
i
wish
your
father
and
mother
were
down
here
too
he
added
i
never
knew
my
mother
dan
deirdre
said
dreamily
you
know
told
you
all
about
that
she
died
when
i
was
born
and
it
was
because
i
was
such
a
wailing
baby
that
my
father
called
me
deirdre
deirdre
of
the
griefs
and
he
lies
over
there
in
the
island
i
remember
him
the
boy
said
eagerly
his
voice
hushed
when
i
was
a
little
kid
we
went
you
and
i
and
father
to
see
him
did
we
and
i
sort
of
remember
a
tall
thin
man
who
had
white
hair
quite
white
hair
and
was
blind
he
was
always
singing
so
as
you
could
scarcely
hear
him
and
once
he
said
suddenly
when
i
was
on
his
knee
do
you
remember
got
her
eyes
deirdre
yes
deirdre
murmured
the
pain
in
her
eyes
deepening
i
wondered
i
often
wondered
what
he
meant
mother
how
could
he
know
what
my
eyes
were
like
he
was
blind
he
meant
your
grandmother
mary
cameron
dan
he
used
to
say
she
had
twilight
eyes
and
that
the
light
of
them
pierced
his
darkness
deirdre
said
the
boy
puzzled
over
that
i
remember
she
said
to
me
once
he
said
thoughtfully
ought
to
be
a
great
man
dan
because
four
great
nations
have
gone
to
the
making
of
you
i
did
know
what
she
meant
at
first
then
she
told
me
that
my
four
grandparents
were
english
irish
scottish
and
welsh
have
quarrelled
and
fought
among
themselves
but
you
are
a
gathering
of
them
in
a
new
country
dan
she
said
will
be
a
great
future
for
the
nation
that
comes
of
you
and
the
boys
and
girls
like
you
it
will
be
a
nation
of
pioneers
with
all
the
adventurous
toiling
strain
of
the
men
and
women
who
came
over
the
sea
and
conquered
the
wilderness
you
belong
to
the
hunted
too
and
suffering
has
taught
you
then
she
told
me
about
prisons
here
in
the
early
days
mother
and
terrible
stories
of
how
people
lived
in
the
old
country
may
talk
about
your
birthstain
by
and
by
dan
she
said
that
will
not
trouble
you
because
it
was
not
this
country
made
the
stain
this
country
has
been
the
redeemer
and
blotted
out
all
those
old
stains
deirdre
gazing
into
the
eager
wistful
face
of
her
son
realised
that
he
was
unfolding
a
dream
to
her
she
smiled
into
his
eyes
and
he
back
to
her
with
a
consciousness
of
the
serene
understanding
and
sympathy
between
them
will
be
a
pioneer
too
dan
grandmother
said
the
boy
continued
with
a
shy
reverence
pioneer
of
paths
that
will
make
the
world
a
better
happier
place
for
everybody
to
live
in
you
will
because
you
wo
be
able
to
help
it
there
the
blood
of
pioneers
in
you
