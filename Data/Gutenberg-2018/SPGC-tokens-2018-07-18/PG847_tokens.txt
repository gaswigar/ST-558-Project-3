the
lay
that
what
is
called
the
history
of
the
kings
and
early
consuls
of
rome
is
to
a
great
extent
fabulous
few
scholars
have
since
the
time
of
beaufort
ventured
to
deny
it
is
certain
that
more
than
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
after
the
date
ordinarily
assigned
for
the
foundation
of
the
city
the
public
records
were
with
scarcely
an
exception
destroyed
by
the
gauls
it
is
certain
that
the
oldest
annals
of
the
commonwealth
were
compiled
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
after
this
destruction
of
the
records
it
is
certain
therefore
that
the
great
latin
writers
of
the
augustan
age
did
not
possess
those
materials
without
which
a
trustworthy
account
of
the
infancy
of
the
republic
could
not
possibly
be
framed
those
writers
own
indeed
that
the
chronicles
to
which
they
had
access
were
filled
with
battles
that
were
never
fought
and
consuls
that
were
never
inaugurated
and
we
have
abundant
proof
that
in
these
chronicles
events
of
the
greatest
importance
such
as
the
issue
of
the
war
with
porsena
and
the
issue
of
the
war
with
brennus
were
grossly
misrepresented
under
these
circumstances
a
wise
man
will
look
with
great
suspicion
on
the
legend
which
has
come
down
to
us
he
will
perhaps
be
inclined
to
regard
the
princes
who
are
said
to
have
founded
the
civil
and
religious
institutions
of
rome
the
sons
of
mars
and
the
husband
of
egeria
as
mere
mythological
personages
of
the
same
class
with
perseus
and
ixion
as
he
draws
nearer
to
the
confines
of
authentic
history
he
will
become
less
and
less
hard
of
belief
he
will
admit
that
the
most
important
parts
of
the
narrative
have
some
foundation
in
truth
but
he
will
distrust
almost
all
the
details
not
only
because
they
seldom
rest
on
any
solid
evidence
but
also
because
he
will
constantly
detect
in
them
even
when
they
are
within
the
limits
of
physical
possibility
that
peculiar
character
more
easily
understood
than
defined
which
distinguishes
the
creations
of
the
imagination
from
the
realities
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
the
early
history
of
rome
is
indeed
far
more
poetical
than
anything
else
in
latin
literature
the
loves
of
the
vestal
and
the
god
of
war
the
cradle
laid
among
the
reeds
of
tiber
the
the
the
shepherd
cabin
the
recognition
the
fratricide
the
rape
of
the
sabines
the
death
of
tarpeia
the
fall
of
hostus
hostilius
the
struggle
of
mettus
curtius
through
the
marsh
the
women
rushing
with
torn
raiment
and
dishevelled
hair
between
their
fathers
and
their
husbands
the
nightly
meetings
of
numa
and
the
nymph
by
the
well
in
the
sacred
grove
the
fight
of
the
three
romans
and
the
three
albans
the
purchase
of
the
sibylline
books
the
crime
of
tullia
the
simulated
madness
of
brutus
the
ambiguous
reply
of
the
delphian
oracle
to
the
tarquins
the
wrongs
of
lucretia
the
heroic
actions
of
horatius
cocles
of
scaevola
and
of
cloelia
the
battle
of
regillus
won
by
the
aid
of
castor
and
pollux
the
defense
of
cremera
the
touching
story
of
coriolanus
the
still
more
touching
story
of
virginia
the
wild
legend
about
the
draining
of
the
alban
lake
the
combat
between
valerius
corvus
and
the
gigantic
gaul
are
among
the
many
instances
which
will
at
once
suggest
themselves
to
every
reader
in
the
narrative
of
livy
who
was
a
man
of
fine
imagination
these
stories
retain
much
of
their
genuine
character
nor
could
even
the
tasteless
dionysius
distort
and
mutilate
them
into
mere
prose
the
poetry
shines
in
spite
of
him
through
the
dreary
pedantry
of
his
eleven
books
it
is
discernible
in
the
most
tedious
and
in
the
most
superficial
modern
works
on
the
early
times
of
rome
it
enlivens
the
dulness
of
the
universal
history
and
gives
a
charm
to
the
most
meagre
abridgements
of
goldsmith
even
in
the
age
of
plutarch
there
were
discerning
men
who
rejected
the
popular
account
of
the
foundation
of
rome
because
that
account
appeared
to
them
to
have
the
air
not
of
a
history
but
of
a
romance
or
a
drama
plutarch
who
was
displeased
at
their
incredulity
had
nothing
better
to
say
in
reply
to
their
arguments
than
that
chance
sometimes
turns
poet
and
produces
trains
of
events
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
most
elaborate
plots
which
are
constructed
by
art
but
though
the
existence
of
a
poetical
element
in
the
early
history
of
the
great
city
was
detected
so
many
ages
ago
the
first
critic
who
distinctly
saw
from
what
source
that
poetical
element
had
been
derived
was
james
perizonius
one
of
the
most
acute
and
learned
antiquaries
of
the
seventeenth
century
his
theory
which
in
his
own
days
attracted
little
or
no
notice
was
revived
in
the
present
generation
by
niebuhr
a
man
who
would
have
been
the
first
writer
of
his
time
if
his
talent
for
communicating
truths
had
borne
any
proportion
to
his
talent
for
investigating
them
that
theory
has
been
adopted
by
several
eminent
scholars
of
our
own
country
particularly
by
the
bishop
of
david
by
professor
malde
and
by
the
lamented
arnold
it
appears
to
be
now
generally
received
by
men
conversant
with
classical
antiquity
and
indeed
it
rests
on
such
strong
proofs
both
internal
and
external
that
it
will
not
be
easily
subverted
a
popular
exposition
of
this
theory
and
of
the
evidence
by
which
it
is
supported
may
not
be
without
interest
even
for
readers
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
ancient
languages
the
latin
literature
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
of
later
date
than
the
commencement
of
the
second
punic
war
and
consists
almost
exclusively
of
works
fashioned
on
greek
models
the
latin
metres
heroic
elegiac
lyric
and
dramatic
are
of
greek
origin
the
best
latin
epic
poetry
is
the
feeble
echo
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
the
best
latin
eclogues
are
imitations
of
theocritus
the
plan
of
the
most
finished
didactic
poem
in
the
latin
tongue
was
taken
from
hesiod
the
latin
tragedies
are
bad
copies
of
the
masterpieces
of
sophocles
and
euripides
the
latin
philosophy
was
borrowed
without
alteration
from
the
portico
and
the
academy
and
the
great
latin
orators
constantly
proposed
to
themselves
as
patterns
the
speeches
of
demosthenes
and
lysias
but
there
was
an
earlier
latin
literature
a
literature
truly
latin
which
has
wholly
perished
which
had
indeed
almost
wholly
perished
long
before
those
whom
we
are
in
the
habit
of
regarding
as
the
greatest
latin
writers
were
born
that
literature
abounded
with
metrical
romances
such
as
are
found
in
every
country
where
there
is
much
curiosity
and
intelligence
but
little
reading
and
writing
all
human
beings
not
utterly
savage
long
for
some
information
about
past
times
and
are
delighted
by
narratives
which
present
pictures
to
the
eye
of
the
mind
but
it
is
only
in
very
enlightened
communities
that
books
are
readily
accessible
metrical
composition
therefore
which
in
a
highly
civilized
nation
is
a
mere
luxury
is
in
nations
imperfectly
civilized
almost
a
necessary
of
life
and
is
valued
less
on
account
of
the
pleasure
which
it
gives
to
the
ear
than
on
account
of
the
help
which
it
gives
to
the
memory
a
man
who
can
invent
or
embellish
an
interesting
story
and
put
it
into
a
form
which
others
may
easily
retain
in
their
recollection
will
always
be
highly
esteemed
by
a
people
eager
for
amusement
and
information
but
destitute
of
libraries
such
is
the
origin
of
a
species
of
composition
which
scarcely
ever
fails
to
spring
up
and
flourish
in
every
society
at
a
certain
point
in
the
progress
towards
refinement
tacitus
informs
us
that
songs
were
the
only
memorials
of
the
past
which
the
ancient
germans
possessed
we
learn
from
lucan
and
from
ammianus
marcellinus
that
the
brave
actions
of
the
ancient
gauls
were
commemorated
in
the
verses
of
bards
during
many
ages
and
through
many
revolution
minstrelsy
retained
its
influence
over
both
the
teutonic
and
the
celtic
race
the
vengeance
exacted
by
the
spouse
of
attila
for
the
murder
of
siegfried
was
celebrated
in
rhymes
of
which
germany
is
still
justly
proud
the
exploits
of
athelstane
were
commemorated
by
the
and
those
of
canute
by
the
danes
in
rude
poems
of
which
a
few
fragments
have
come
down
to
us
the
chants
of
the
welsh
harpers
preserved
through
ages
of
darkness
a
faint
and
doubtful
memory
of
arthur
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
may
still
be
gleaned
some
relics
of
the
old
songs
about
cuthullin
and
fingal
the
long
struggle
of
the
servians
against
the
ottoman
power
was
recorded
in
lays
full
of
martial
spirit
we
learn
from
herrera
that
when
a
peruvian
inca
died
men
of
skill
were
appointed
to
celebrate
him
in
verses
which
all
the
people
learned
by
heart
and
sang
in
public
on
days
of
festival
the
feats
of
kurroglou
the
great
freebooter
of
turkistan
recounted
in
ballads
composed
by
himself
are
known
in
every
village
of
northern
persia
captain
beechey
heard
the
bards
of
the
sandwich
islands
recite
the
heroic
achievements
of
tamehameha
the
most
illustrious
of
their
kings
mungo
park
found
in
the
heart
of
africa
a
class
of
singing
men
the
only
annalists
of
their
rude
tribes
and
heard
them
tell
the
story
of
the
victory
which
damel
the
negro
prince
of
the
jaloffs
won
over
abdulkader
the
mussulman
tyrant
of
foota
torra
this
species
of
poetry
attained
a
high
degree
of
excellence
among
the
castilians
before
they
began
to
copy
tuscan
patterns
it
attained
a
still
higher
degree
of
excellence
among
the
english
and
the
lowland
scotch
during
the
fourteenth
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
but
it
reached
its
full
perfection
in
ancient
greece
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
great
homeric
poems
are
generically
ballads
though
widely
distinguished
from
all
other
ballads
and
indeed
from
almost
all
other
human
composition
by
transcendent
sublimity
and
beauty
as
it
is
agreeable
to
general
experience
that
at
a
certain
stage
in
the
progress
of
society
should
flourish
so
is
it
also
agreeable
to
general
experience
that
at
a
subsequent
stage
in
the
progress
of
society
should
be
undervalued
and
neglected
knowledge
advances
manners
change
great
foreign
models
of
composition
are
studied
and
imitated
the
phraseology
of
the
old
minstrels
becomes
obsolete
their
versification
which
having
received
its
laws
only
from
the
ear
abounds
in
irregularities
seems
licentious
and
uncouth
their
simplicity
appears
beggarly
when
compared
with
the
quaint
forms
and
gaudy
coloring
of
such
artists
as
cowley
and
gongora
the
ancient
lays
unjustly
despised
by
the
learned
and
polite
linger
for
a
time
in
the
memory
of
the
vulgar
and
are
at
length
too
often
irretrievably
lost
we
can
not
wonder
that
the
ballads
of
rome
should
have
altogether
disappeared
when
we
remember
how
very
narrowly
in
spite
of
the
invention
of
printing
those
of
our
own
country
and
those
of
spain
escaped
the
same
fate
there
is
indeed
little
doubt
that
oblivion
covers
many
english
songs
equal
to
any
that
were
published
by
bishop
percy
and
many
spanish
songs
as
good
as
the
best
of
those
which
have
been
so
happily
translated
by
lockhart
eighty
years
ago
england
possessed
only
one
tattered
copy
of
childe
waters
and
sir
cauline
and
spain
only
one
tattered
copy
of
the
noble
poem
of
the
cid
the
snuff
of
a
candle
or
a
mischievous
dog
might
in
a
moment
have
deprived
the
world
forever
of
any
of
those
fine
compositions
sir
walter
scott
who
united
to
the
fire
of
a
great
poet
the
minute
curiosity
and
patient
diligence
of
a
great
antiquary
was
but
just
in
time
to
save
the
precious
relics
of
the
minstrelsy
of
the
border
in
germany
the
lay
of
the
nibelungs
had
been
long
utterly
forgotten
when
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
for
the
first
time
printed
from
a
manuscript
in
the
old
library
of
a
noble
family
in
truth
the
only
people
who
through
their
whole
passage
from
simplicity
to
the
highest
civilization
never
for
a
moment
ceased
to
love
and
admire
their
old
ballads
were
the
greeks
that
the
early
romans
should
have
had
and
that
this
poetry
should
have
perished
is
therefore
not
strange
it
would
on
the
contrary
have
been
strange
if
these
things
had
not
come
to
pass
and
we
should
be
justified
in
pronouncing
them
highly
probable
even
if
we
had
no
direct
evidence
on
the
subject
but
we
have
direct
evidence
of
unquestionable
authority
ennius
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
the
second
punic
war
was
regarded
in
the
augustan
age
as
the
father
of
latin
poetry
he
was
in
truth
the
father
of
the
second
school
of
latin
poetry
the
only
school
of
which
the
works
have
descended
to
us
but
from
ennius
himself
we
learn
that
there
were
poets
who
stood
to
him
in
the
same
relation
in
which
the
author
of
the
romance
of
count
alarcos
stood
to
garcilaso
or
the
author
of
the
lytell
geste
of
robyn
hode
to
lord
surrey
ennius
speaks
of
verses
which
the
fauns
and
the
bards
were
wont
to
chant
in
the
old
time
when
none
had
yet
studied
the
graces
of
speech
when
none
had
yet
climbed
the
peaks
sacred
to
the
goddesses
of
grecian
song
where
cicero
mournfully
asks
are
those
old
verses
now
contemporary
with
ennius
was
quintus
fabius
pactor
the
earliest
of
the
roman
annalists
his
account
of
the
infancy
and
youth
of
romulus
and
remus
has
been
preserved
by
dionysius
and
contains
a
very
remarkable
reference
to
the
ancient
latin
poetry
fabius
says
that
in
his
time
his
countrymen
were
still
in
the
habit
of
singing
ballads
about
the
twins
even
in
the
hut
of
faustulus
so
these
old
lays
appear
to
have
run
the
children
of
rhea
and
mars
were
in
port
and
in
spirit
not
like
unto
swineherds
or
cowherds
but
such
that
men
might
well
guess
them
to
be
of
the
blood
of
kings
and
gods
cato
the
censor
who
also
lived
in
the
days
of
he
second
punic
war
mentioned
this
lost
literature
in
his
lost
work
on
the
antiquities
of
his
country
many
ages
he
said
before
his
time
there
were
ballads
in
praise
of
illustrious
men
and
these
ballads
it
was
the
fashion
for
the
guests
at
banquets
to
sing
in
turn
while
the
piper
played
would
exclaims
cicero
that
we
still
had
the
old
ballads
of
which
cato
speaks
valerius
maximus
gives
us
exactly
similar
information
without
mentioning
his
authority
and
observes
that
the
ancient
roman
ballads
were
probably
of
more
benefit
to
the
young
than
all
the
lectures
of
the
athenian
schools
and
that
to
the
influence
of
the
national
poetry
were
to
be
ascribed
the
virtues
of
such
men
as
camillus
and
fabricus
varro
whose
authority
on
all
questions
connected
with
the
antiquities
of
his
country
is
entitled
to
the
greatest
respect
tells
us
that
at
banquets
it
was
once
the
fashion
for
boys
to
sing
sometimes
with
and
sometimes
without
instrumental
music
ancient
ballads
in
praise
of
men
of
former
times
these
young
performers
he
observes
were
of
unblemished
character
a
circumstance
which
he
probably
mentioned
because
among
the
greeks
and
indeed
in
his
time
among
the
romans
also
the
morals
of
singing
boys
were
in
no
high
repute
the
testimony
of
horace
though
given
incidentally
confirms
the
statements
of
cato
valerius
maximus
and
varro
the
poet
predicts
that
under
the
peaceful
administration
of
augustus
the
romans
will
over
their
full
goblets
sing
to
the
pipe
after
the
fashion
of
their
fathers
the
deeds
of
brave
captains
and
the
ancient
legends
touching
the
origin
of
the
city
the
proposition
then
that
rome
had
is
not
merely
in
itself
highly
probable
but
is
fully
proved
by
direct
evidence
of
the
greatest
weight
this
proposition
being
established
it
becomes
easy
to
understand
why
the
early
history
of
the
city
is
unlike
almost
everything
else
in
latin
literature
native
where
almost
everything
else
is
borrowed
imaginative
where
almost
everything
else
is
prosaic
we
can
scarcely
hesitate
to
pronounce
that
the
magnificent
pathetic
and
truly
national
legends
which
present
so
striking
a
contrast
to
all
that
surrounds
them
are
broken
and
defaced
fragments
of
that
early
poetry
which
even
in
the
age
of
cato
the
censor
had
become
antiquated
and
of
which
tully
had
never
heard
a
line
that
this
poetry
should
have
been
suffered
to
perish
will
not
appear
strange
when
we
consider
how
complete
was
the
triumph
of
the
greek
genius
over
the
public
mind
of
italy
it
is
probable
that
at
an
early
period
homer
and
herodotus
furnished
some
hints
to
the
latin
minstrels
but
it
was
not
till
after
the
war
with
pyrrhus
that
the
poetry
of
rome
began
to
put
off
its
old
ausonian
character
the
transformation
was
soon
consummated
the
conquered
says
horace
led
captive
the
conquerors
it
was
precisely
at
the
time
at
which
the
roman
people
rose
to
unrivalled
political
ascendency
that
they
stooped
to
pass
under
the
intellectual
yoke
it
was
precisely
at
the
time
at
which
the
sceptre
departed
from
greece
that
the
empire
of
her
language
and
of
her
arts
became
universal
and
despotic
the
revolution
indeed
was
not
effected
without
a
struggle
naevius
seems
to
have
been
the
last
of
the
ancient
line
of
poets
ennius
was
the
founder
of
a
new
dynasty
naevius
celebrated
the
first
punic
war
in
saturnian
verse
the
old
national
verse
of
italy
ennius
sang
the
second
punic
war
in
numbers
borrowed
from
the
iliad
the
elder
poet
in
the
epitaph
which
he
wrote
for
himself
and
which
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
early
roman
diction
and
versification
plaintively
boasted
that
the
latin
language
had
died
with
him
thus
what
to
horace
appeared
to
be
the
first
faint
dawn
of
roman
literature
appeared
to
naevius
to
be
its
hopeless
setting
in
truth
one
literature
was
setting
and
another
dawning
the
victory
of
the
foreign
taste
was
decisive
and
indeed
we
can
hardly
blame
the
romans
for
turning
away
with
contempt
from
the
rude
lays
which
had
delighted
their
fathers
and
giving
their
whole
admiration
to
the
immortal
productions
of
greece
the
national
romances
neglected
by
the
great
and
the
refined
whose
education
had
been
finished
at
rhodes
or
athens
continued
it
may
be
supposed
during
some
generations
to
delight
the
vulgar
while
virgil
in
hexameters
of
exquisite
modulation
described
the
sports
of
rustics
those
rustics
were
still
singing
their
wild
saturnian
ballads
it
is
not
improbable
that
at
the
time
when
cicero
lamented
the
irreparable
loss
of
the
poems
mentioned
by
cato
a
search
among
the
nooks
of
the
appenines
as
active
as
the
search
which
sir
walter
scott
made
among
the
descendents
of
the
mosstroopers
of
liddesdale
might
have
brought
to
light
many
fine
remains
of
ancient
minstrelsy
no
such
search
was
made
the
latin
ballads
perished
forever
yet
discerning
critics
have
thought
that
they
could
still
perceive
in
the
early
history
of
rome
numerous
fragments
of
this
lost
poetry
as
the
traveller
on
classic
ground
sometimes
finds
built
into
the
heavy
wall
of
a
fort
or
convent
a
pillar
rich
with
acanthus
leaves
or
a
frieze
where
the
amazons
and
bacchanals
seem
to
live
the
theatres
and
temples
of
the
greek
and
the
roman
were
degraded
into
the
quarries
of
the
turk
and
the
goth
even
so
did
the
ancient
saturnian
poetry
become
the
quarry
in
which
a
crowd
of
orators
and
annalists
found
the
materials
for
their
prose
it
is
not
difficult
to
trace
the
process
by
which
the
old
songs
were
transmuted
into
the
form
which
they
now
wear
funeral
panegyric
and
chronicle
appear
to
have
been
the
intermediate
links
which
connected
the
lost
ballads
with
the
histories
now
extant
from
a
very
early
period
it
was
the
usage
that
an
oration
should
be
pronounced
over
the
remains
of
a
noble
roman
the
orator
as
we
learn
from
polybius
was
expected
on
such
occasions
to
recapitulate
all
the
services
which
the
ancestors
of
the
deceased
had
from
the
earliest
time
rendered
to
the
commonwealth
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
speaker
on
whom
this
duty
was
imposed
would
make
use
of
all
the
stories
suited
to
his
purpose
which
were
to
be
found
in
the
popular
lays
there
can
be
as
little
doubt
that
the
family
of
an
eminent
man
would
preserve
a
copy
of
the
speech
which
had
been
pronounced
over
his
corpse
the
compilers
of
the
early
chronicles
would
have
recourse
to
these
speeches
and
the
great
historians
of
a
later
period
would
have
recourse
to
the
chronicles
it
may
be
worth
while
to
select
a
particular
story
and
to
trace
its
probable
progress
through
these
stages
the
description
of
the
migration
of
the
fabian
house
to
cremera
is
one
of
the
finest
of
the
many
fine
passages
which
lie
thick
in
the
earlier
books
of
livy
the
consul
clad
in
his
military
garb
stands
in
the
vestibule
of
his
house
marshalling
his
clan
three
hundred
and
six
fighting
men
all
of
the
same
proud
patrician
blood
all
worthy
to
be
attended
by
the
fasces
and
to
command
the
legions
a
sad
and
anxious
retinue
of
friends
accompanies
the
adventurers
through
the
streets
but
the
voice
of
lamentation
is
drowned
by
the
shouts
of
admiring
thousands
as
the
procession
passes
the
capitol
prayers
and
vows
are
poured
forth
but
in
vain
the
devoted
band
leaving
janus
on
the
right
marches
to
its
doom
through
the
gate
of
evil
luck
after
achieving
high
deeds
of
valor
against
overwhelming
numbers
all
perish
save
one
child
the
stock
from
which
the
great
fabian
race
was
destined
again
to
spring
for
the
safety
and
glory
of
the
commonwealth
that
this
fine
romance
the
details
of
which
are
so
full
of
poetical
truth
and
so
utterly
destitute
of
all
show
of
historical
truth
came
originally
from
some
lay
which
had
often
been
sung
with
great
applause
at
banquets
is
in
the
highest
degree
probable
nor
is
it
difficult
to
imagine
a
mode
in
which
the
transmission
might
have
taken
place
the
celebrated
quintus
fabius
maximus
who
died
about
twenty
years
before
the
first
punic
war
and
more
than
forty
years
before
ennius
was
born
is
said
to
have
been
interred
with
extraordinary
pomp
in
the
eulogy
pronounced
over
his
body
all
the
great
exploits
of
his
ancestors
were
doubtless
recounted
and
exaggerated
if
there
were
then
extant
songs
which
gave
a
vivid
and
touching
description
of
an
event
the
saddest
and
the
most
glorious
in
the
long
history
of
the
fabian
house
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
the
panegyrist
should
borrow
from
such
songs
their
finest
touches
in
order
to
adorn
his
speech
a
few
generations
later
the
songs
would
perhaps
be
forgotten
or
remembered
only
by
shepherds
and
vinedressers
but
the
speech
would
certainly
be
preserved
in
the
archives
of
the
fabian
nobles
fabius
pictor
would
be
well
acquainted
with
a
document
so
interesting
to
his
personal
feelings
and
would
insert
large
extracts
from
it
in
his
rude
chronicle
that
chronicle
as
we
know
was
the
oldest
to
which
livy
had
access
livy
would
at
a
glance
distinguish
the
bold
strokes
of
the
forgotten
poet
from
the
dull
and
feeble
narrative
by
which
they
were
surrounded
would
retouch
them
with
a
delicate
and
powerful
pencil
and
would
make
them
immortal
that
this
might
happen
at
rome
can
scarcely
be
doubted
for
something
very
like
this
has
happened
in
several
countries
and
among
others
in
our
own
perhaps
the
theory
of
perizonius
can
not
be
better
illustrated
than
by
showing
that
what
he
supposes
to
have
taken
place
in
ancient
times
has
beyond
all
doubt
taken
place
in
modern
times
history
says
hume
with
the
utmost
gravity
has
preserved
some
instances
of
edgar
amours
from
which
as
from
a
specimen
we
may
form
a
conjecture
of
the
rest
he
then
tells
very
agreeably
the
stories
of
elfleda
and
elfrida
two
stories
which
have
a
most
suspicious
air
of
romance
ad
which
indeed
greatly
resemble
in
their
character
some
of
the
legends
of
early
rome
he
cites
as
his
authority
for
these
two
tales
the
chronicle
of
william
of
malmesbury
who
lived
in
the
time
of
king
stephen
the
great
majority
of
readers
suppose
that
the
device
by
which
elfleda
was
substituted
for
her
young
mistress
the
artifice
by
which
athelwold
obtained
the
hand
of
elfrida
the
detection
of
that
artifice
the
hunting
party
and
the
vengeance
of
the
amorous
king
are
things
about
which
there
is
no
more
doubt
than
about
the
execution
of
anne
boleyn
or
the
slitting
of
sir
john
coventry
nose
but
when
we
turn
to
william
of
malmesbury
we
find
that
hume
in
his
eagerness
to
relate
these
pleasant
fables
has
overlooked
one
very
important
circumstance
william
does
indeed
tell
both
the
stories
but
he
gives
us
distinct
notice
that
he
does
not
warrant
their
truth
and
that
they
rest
on
no
better
authority
than
that
of
ballads
such
is
the
way
in
which
these
two
tales
have
been
handed
down
they
originally
appeared
in
a
poetical
form
they
found
their
way
from
ballads
into
an
old
chronicle
the
ballads
perished
the
chronicle
remained
a
great
historian
some
centuries
after
the
ballads
had
been
altogether
forgotten
consulted
the
chronicle
he
was
struck
by
the
lively
coloring
of
these
ancient
fictions
he
transferred
them
to
his
pages
and
thus
we
find
inserted
as
unquestionable
facts
in
a
narrative
which
is
likely
to
last
as
long
as
the
english
tongue
the
inventions
of
some
minstrel
whose
works
were
probably
never
committed
to
writing
whose
name
is
buried
in
oblivion
and
whose
dialect
has
become
obsolete
it
must
then
be
admitted
to
be
possible
or
rather
highly
probable
that
the
stories
of
romulus
and
remus
and
of
the
horatii
and
curiatti
may
have
had
a
similar
origin
castilian
literature
will
furnish
us
with
another
parallel
case
mariana
the
classical
historian
of
spain
tells
the
story
of
the
marriage
which
the
king
don
alonso
brought
about
between
the
heirs
of
carrion
and
the
two
daughters
of
the
cid
the
cid
bestowed
a
princely
dower
on
the
but
the
young
men
were
base
and
proud
cowardly
and
cruel
they
were
tried
in
danger
and
found
wanting
they
fled
before
the
moors
and
once
when
a
lion
broke
out
of
his
den
they
ran
and
crouched
in
an
unseemly
they
knew
that
they
were
despised
and
took
counsel
how
they
might
be
avenged
they
parted
from
their
with
many
signs
of
love
and
set
forth
on
a
journey
with
doña
elvira
and
doña
sol
in
a
solitary
place
the
bridegrooms
seized
their
brides
stripped
them
scourged
them
and
departed
leaving
them
for
dead
but
one
of
the
house
of
bivar
suspecting
foul
play
had
followed
the
travellers
in
disguise
the
ladies
were
brought
back
safe
to
the
house
of
their
father
complaint
was
made
to
the
king
it
was
adjudged
by
the
cortes
that
the
dower
given
by
the
cid
should
be
returned
and
that
the
heirs
of
carrion
together
with
one
of
their
kindred
should
do
battle
against
three
knights
of
the
party
of
the
cid
the
guilty
youths
would
have
declined
the
combat
but
all
their
shifts
were
in
vain
they
were
vanquished
in
the
lists
and
forever
disgraced
while
their
injured
wives
were
sought
in
marriage
by
great
princes
some
spanish
writers
have
labored
to
show
by
an
examination
of
dates
and
circumstances
that
this
story
is
untrue
such
confutation
was
surely
not
needed
for
the
narrative
is
on
the
face
of
it
a
romance
how
it
found
its
way
into
mariana
history
is
quite
clear
he
acknowledges
his
obligations
to
the
ancient
chronicles
and
had
doubtless
before
him
the
cronica
del
famoso
cavallero
cid
ruy
diez
campeador
which
had
been
printed
as
early
as
the
year
he
little
suspected
that
all
the
most
striking
passages
in
this
chronicle
were
copied
from
a
poem
of
the
twelfth
century
a
poem
of
which
the
language
and
versification
had
long
been
obsolete
but
which
glowed
with
no
common
portion
of
the
fire
of
the
iliad
yet
such
is
the
fact
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
after
the
death
of
mariana
this
venerable
ballad
of
which
one
imperfect
copy
on
parchment
four
hundred
years
old
had
been
preserved
at
bivar
was
for
the
first
time
printed
then
it
was
found
that
every
interesting
circumstance
of
the
story
of
the
heirs
of
carrion
was
derived
by
the
eloquent
jesuit
from
a
song
of
which
he
had
never
heard
and
which
was
composed
by
a
minstrel
whose
very
name
had
been
long
forgotten
such
or
nearly
such
appears
to
have
been
the
process
by
which
the
lost
of
rome
was
transformed
into
history
to
reverse
that
process
to
transform
some
portions
of
early
roman
history
back
into
the
poetry
out
of
which
they
were
made
is
the
object
of
this
work
in
the
following
poems
the
author
speaks
not
in
his
own
person
but
in
the
persons
of
ancient
minstrels
who
know
only
what
roman
citizen
born
three
or
four
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
may
be
supposed
to
have
known
and
who
are
in
no
wise
above
the
passions
and
prejudices
of
their
age
and
nation
to
these
imaginary
poets
must
be
ascribed
some
blunders
which
are
so
obvious
that
is
unnecessary
to
point
them
out
the
real
blunder
would
have
been
to
represent
these
old
poets
as
deeply
versed
in
general
history
and
studious
of
chronological
accuracy
to
them
must
also
be
attributed
the
illiberal
sneers
at
the
greeks
the
furious
party
spirit
the
contempt
for
the
arts
of
peace
the
love
of
war
for
its
own
sake
the
ungenerous
exultation
over
the
vanquished
which
the
reader
will
sometimes
observe
to
portray
a
roman
of
the
age
of
camillus
or
curius
as
superior
to
national
antipathies
as
mourning
over
the
devastation
and
slaughter
by
which
empire
and
triumphs
were
to
be
won
as
looking
on
human
suffering
with
the
sympathy
of
howard
or
as
treating
conquered
enemies
with
the
delicacy
of
the
black
prince
would
be
to
violate
all
dramatic
propriety
the
old
romans
had
some
great
virtues
fortitude
temperance
veracity
spirit
to
resist
oppression
respect
for
legitimate
authority
fidelity
in
the
observing
of
contracts
disinterestedness
ardent
patriotism
but
christian
charity
and
chivalrous
generosity
were
alike
unknown
to
them
it
would
have
been
obviously
improper
to
mimic
the
manner
of
any
particular
age
or
country
something
has
been
borrowed
however
from
our
own
old
ballads
and
more
from
sir
walter
scott
the
great
restorer
of
our
to
the
iliad
still
greater
obligations
are
due
and
those
obligations
have
been
contracted
with
the
less
hesitation
because
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
some
of
the
old
latin
minstrels
really
had
recourse
to
that
inexhaustible
store
of
poetical
images
it
would
have
been
easy
to
swell
this
little
volume
to
a
very
considerable
bulk
by
appending
notes
filled
with
quotations
but
to
a
learned
reader
such
notes
are
not
necessary
for
an
unlearned
reader
they
would
have
little
interest
and
the
judgment
passed
both
by
the
learned
and
by
the
unlearned
on
a
work
of
the
imagination
will
always
depend
much
more
on
the
general
character
and
spirit
of
such
a
work
than
on
minute
details
horatius
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
among
those
parts
of
early
roman
history
which
had
a
poetical
origin
was
the
legend
of
horatius
cocles
we
have
several
versions
of
the
story
and
these
versions
differ
from
each
other
in
points
of
no
small
importance
polybius
there
is
reason
to
believe
heard
the
tale
recited
over
the
remains
of
some
consul
or
prætor
descended
from
the
old
horatian
patricians
for
he
introduces
it
as
a
specimen
of
the
narratives
with
which
the
romans
were
in
the
habit
of
embellishing
their
funeral
oratory
it
is
remarkable
that
according
to
him
horatius
defended
the
bridge
alone
and
perished
in
the
waters
according
to
the
chronicles
which
livy
and
dionysius
followed
horatius
had
two
companions
swam
safe
to
shore
and
was
loaded
with
honors
and
rewards
these
discrepancies
are
easily
explained
our
own
literature
indeed
will
furnish
an
exact
parallel
to
what
may
have
taken
place
at
rome
it
is
highly
probably
that
the
memory
of
the
war
of
porsena
was
preserved
by
compositions
much
resembling
the
two
ballads
which
stand
first
in
the
relics
of
ancient
english
poetry
in
both
those
ballads
the
english
commanded
by
the
percy
fight
with
the
scots
commanded
by
the
douglas
in
one
of
the
ballads
the
douglas
is
killed
by
a
nameless
english
archer
and
the
percy
by
a
scottish
spearman
in
the
other
the
percy
slays
the
douglas
in
single
combat
and
is
himself
made
prisoner
in
the
former
sir
hugh
montgomery
is
shot
through
the
heart
by
a
northumbrian
bowman
in
the
latter
he
is
taken
and
exchanged
for
the
percy
yet
both
the
ballads
relate
to
the
same
event
and
that
event
which
probably
took
place
within
the
memory
of
persons
who
were
alive
when
both
the
ballads
were
made
one
of
the
minstrels
says
old
men
that
knowen
the
grounde
well
yenoughe
call
it
the
battell
of
otterburn
at
otterburn
began
this
spurne
upon
a
monnyn
day
ther
was
the
dougghte
doglas
slean
the
perse
never
went
away
the
other
poet
sums
up
the
event
in
the
following
lines
thys
fraye
bygan
at
otterborne
bytwene
the
nyghte
and
the
day
ther
the
doglas
lost
hys
lyfe
and
the
percy
was
lede
away
it
is
by
no
means
unlikely
that
there
were
two
old
roman
lays
about
the
defence
of
the
bridge
and
that
while
the
story
which
livy
has
transmitted
to
us
was
preferred
by
the
multitude
the
other
which
ascribed
the
whole
glory
to
horatius
alone
may
have
been
the
favorite
with
the
horatian
house
the
following
ballad
is
supposed
to
have
been
made
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
after
the
war
which
it
celebrates
and
just
before
the
taking
of
rome
by
the
gauls
the
author
seems
to
have
been
an
honest
citizen
proud
of
the
military
glory
of
his
country
sick
of
the
disputes
of
factions
and
much
given
to
pining
after
good
old
times
which
had
never
really
existed
the
allusion
however
to
the
partial
manner
in
which
the
public
lands
were
allotted
could
proceed
only
from
a
plebeian
and
the
allusion
to
the
fraudulent
sale
of
spoils
marks
the
date
of
the
poem
and
shows
that
the
poet
shared
in
the
general
discontent
with
which
the
proceedings
of
camullus
after
the
taking
of
veii
were
regarded
the
penultimate
syllable
of
the
name
porsena
has
been
shortened
in
spite
of
the
authority
of
niebuhr
who
pronounces
without
assigning
any
ground
for
his
opinion
that
martial
was
guilty
of
a
decided
blunder
in
the
line
hanc
spectare
manum
porsena
non
potuit
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
any
modern
scholar
whatever
his
attainments
may
be
and
those
of
niebuhr
were
undoubtedly
immense
can
venture
to
pronounce
that
martial
did
not
know
the
quantity
of
a
word
which
he
must
have
uttered
and
heard
uttered
a
hundred
times
before
he
left
school
niebuhr
seems
also
to
have
forgotten
that
martial
has
fellow
culprits
to
keep
him
in
countenance
horace
has
committed
the
same
decided
blunder
for
he
give
us
as
a
pure
iambic
line
minacis
aut
etrusca
porsenæ
dextram
silius
italicus
has
repeatedly
offended
in
the
same
way
as
when
he
says
clusinum
vulgus
cum
porsena
magne
jubebas
a
modern
writer
may
be
content
to
err
in
such
company
niebuhr
supposition
that
each
of
the
three
defenders
of
the
bridge
was
the
representative
of
one
of
the
three
patrician
tribes
is
both
ingenious
and
probable
and
has
been
adopted
in
the
following
poem

lay
made

the

for

fast

ye

shook

xxvi
but
the
consul
brow
was
sad
and
the

speech
was
low

darkly
looked
he
at

darkly
at
the

their
van
will
be

goes
down

once
may
win

the
flinching
tuscans

scorn

in
his
eye

the
litter

savagely
at

ye
dare
to
follow
if
astur

then
whirling
up
his
broadsword
with
both
hands
to
the
height
he
rushed
against
horatius
and
smote
with
all
his
might
with
shield
and
blade
horatius
right
deftly
turned
the
blow
the
blow
though
turned
came
yet
too
nigh
it
missed
his
helm
but
gashed
his
thigh
the
tuscans
raised
a
joyful
cry
to
see
the
red
blood
flow
xlv
he
reeled
and
on
herminius
he
leaned
one
then
like
a
wild
cat
mad
with
wounds
sprang
right
at
astur
face
through
teeth
and
skull
and
helmet
so
fierce
a
thrust
he
sped
the
good
sword
stood
a
out
behind
the
tuscan
head
xlvi
and
the
great
lord
of
luna
fell
at
that
deadly
stroke
as
falls
on
mount
alvernus
a
thunder
smitten
oak
far
the
crashing
forest
the
giant
arms
lie
spread
and
the
pale
augurs
muttering
low
gaze
on
the
blasted
head
xlvii
on
astur
throat
horatius
right
firmly
pressed
his
heel
and
thrice
and
four
times
tugged
amain
ere
he
wrenched
out
the
steel
and

he
cried
the
welcome
fair
guests
that
waits
you
here
what
noble
lucomo
comes
next
to
taste
our
roman
cheer
xlviii
but
at
his
haughty
challenge
a
sullen
murmur
ran
mingled
of
wrath
and
shame
and
dread
along
that
glittering
van
there
lacked
not
men
of
prowess
nor
men
of
lordly
race
for
all
etruria
noblest
were
round
the
fatal
place
xlix
but
all
etruria
noblest
felt
their
hearts
sink
to
see
on
the
earth
the
bloody
corpses
in
the
path
the
dauntless
three
and
from
the
ghastly
entrance
where
those
bold
romans
stood
all
shrank
like
boys
who
unaware
ranging
the
woods
to
start
a
hare
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
dark
lair
where
growling
low
a
fierce
old
bear
lies
amidst
bones
and
blood
l
was
none
who
would
be
foremost
to
lead
such
dire
attack
but
those
behind
cried
forward
and
those
before
cried
back
and
backward
now
and
forward
wavers
the
deep
array
and
on
the
tossing
sea
of
steel
to
and
frow
the
standards

and
the
victorious
dies
fitfully
away
li
yet
one
man
for
one
moment
strode
out
before
the
crowd
well
known
was
he
to
all
the
three
and
they
gave
him
greeting
loud
now
welcome
welcome
sextus
now
welcome
to
thy
home
why
dost
thou
stay
and
turn
away
here
lies
the
road
to

lii
thrice
looked
he
at
the
city
thrice
looked
he
at
the
dead
and
thrice
came
on
in
fury
and
thrice
turned
back
in
dread
and
white
with
fear
and
hatred
scowled
at
the
narrow
way
where
wallowing
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
bravest
tuscans
lay
liii
but
meanwhile
axe
and
lever
have
manfully
been
plied
and
now
the
bridge
hangs
tottering
above
the
boiling
tide
come
back
come
back
horatius
loud
cried
the
fathers
all
back
lartius
back
herminius
back
ere
the
ruin
fall
liv
back
darted
spurius
lartius
herminius
darted
back
and
as
they
passed
beneath
their
feet
they
felt
the
timbers
crack
but
when
they
turned
their
faces
and
on
the
farther
shore
saw
brave
horatius
stand
alone
they
would
have
crossed
once
more
lv
but
with
a
crash
like
thunder
fell
every
loosened
beam
and
like
a
dam
the
mighty
wreck
lay
right
athwart
the
stream
and
a
long
shout
of
triumph
rose
from
the
walls
of
rome
as
to
the
highest
was
splashed
the
yellow
foam
lvi
and
like
a
horse
unbroken
when
first
he
feels
the
rein
the
furious
river
struggled
hard
and
tossed
his
tawny
mane
and
burst
the
curb
and
bounded
rejoicing
to
be
free
and
whirling
down
in
fierce
career
battlement
and
plank
and
pier
rushed
headlong
to
the
sea
lvii
alone
stood
brave
horatius
but
constant
still
in
mind
thrice
thirty
thousand
foes
before
and
the
broad
flood
behind
down
with
him
cried
false
sextus
with
a
smile
on
his
pale
face
now
yield
thee
cried
lars
porsena
now
yield
thee
to
our
grace
lviii
round
turned
he
as
not
deigning
those
craven
ranks
to
see
nought
spake
he
to
lars
porsena
to
sextus
nought
spake
he
but
he
saw
on
palatinus
the
white
porch
of
his
home
and
he
spake
to
the
noble
river
that
rolls
by
the
towers
of
rome
lvix
oh
tiber
father
tiber
to
whom
the
romans
pray
a
roman
life
a
roman
arms
take
thou
in
charge
this
day
so
he
spake
and
speaking
sheathed
the
good
sword
by
his
side
and
with
his
harness
on
his
back
plunged
headlong
in
the
tide
lx
no
sound
of
joy
or
sorrow
was
heard
from
either
bank
but
friends
and
foes
in
dumb
surprise
with
parted
lips
and
straining
eyes
stood
gazing
where
he
sank
and
when
above
the
surges
they
saw
his
crest
appear
all
rome
sent
forth
a
rapturous
cry
and
even
the
ranks
of
tuscany
could
scarce
forbear
to
cheer
lxi
but
fiercely
ran
the
current
swollen
high
by
months
of
rain
and
fast
his
blood
was
flowing
and
he
was
sore
in
pain
and
heavy
with
his
armor
and
spent
with
changing
blows
and
oft
they
thought
him
sinking
but
still
again
he
rose
lxii
never
i
ween
did
swimmer
in
such
an
evil
case
struggle
through
such
a
raging
flood
safe
to
the
landing
place
but
his
limbs
were
borne
up
bravely
by
the
brave
heart
within
and
our
good
father
tiber
bare
bravely
up
his
chin
lxiii
curse
on
him
quoth
false
sextus
will
not
the
villain
drown
but
for
this
stay
ere
close
of
day
we
should
have
sacked
the
town
heaven
help
him
quoth
lars
porsena
and
bring
him
safe
to
shore
for
such
a
gallant
feat
of
arms
was
never
seen
before
lxiv
and
now
he
feels
the
bottom
now
on
dry
earth
he
stands
now
round
him
throng
the
fathers
to
press
his
gory
hands
and
now
with
shouts
and
clapping
and
noise
of
weeping
loud
he
enters
through
the
borne
by
the
joyous
crowd
lxv
they
gave
him
of
the
that
was
of
public
right
as
much
as
two
strong
oxen
could
plough
from
morn
till
night
and
they
made
a
molten
image
and
set
it
up
on
high
and
there
is
stands
unto
this
day
to
witness
if
i
lie
lxvi
it
stands
in
the
comitium
plain
for
all
folk
to
see
horatius
in
his
harness
halting
upon
one
knee
and
underneath
is
written
in
letters
all
of
gold
how
valiantly
he
kept
the
bridge
in
the
brave
days
of
old
lxvii
and
still
his
name
sounds
stirring
unto
the
men
of
rome
as
the
that
cries
to
them
to
charge
the
volscian
home
and
wives
still
pray
to
juno
for
boys
with
hearts
as
bold
as
his
who
kept
the
bridge
so
well
in
the
brave
days
of
old
lxviii
and
in
the
nights
of
winter
when
the
cold
north
winds
blow
and
the
long
howling
of
the
wolves
is
heard
amidst
the
snow
when
round
the
lonely
cottage
roars
loud
the
tempest
din
and
the
good
logs
of
algidus
roar
louder
yet
within
lxix
when
the
oldest
cask
is
opened
and
the
largest
lamp
is
lit
when
the
chestnuts
glow
in
the
embers
and
the
kid
turns
on
the
spit
when
young
and
old
in
circle
around
the
firebrands
close
when
the
girls
are
weaving
baskets
and
the
lads
are
shaping
bows
lxx
when
the
goodman
mends
his
armor
and
trims
his
helmet
plume
when
the
goodwife
shuttle
merrily
goes
flashing
through
the
loom
with
weeping
and
with
laughter
still
is
the
story
told
how
well
horatius
kept
the
bridge
in
the
brave
days
of
old
the
battle
of
the
lake
regillus
the
following
poem
is
supposed
to
have
been
produced
about
ninety
years
after
the
lay
of
horatius
some
persons
mentioned
in
the
lay
of
horatius
make
their
appearance
again
and
some
appellations
and
epithets
used
in
the
lay
of
horatius
have
been
purposely
repeated
for
in
an
age
of
it
scarcely
ever
fails
to
happen
that
certain
phrases
come
to
be
appropriated
to
certain
men
and
things
and
are
regularly
applied
to
those
men
and
things
by
every
minstrel
thus
we
find
both
in
the
homeric
poems
and
in
hesiod
several
examples
of
common
phrases
in
greek
thus
too
in
our
own
national
songs
douglas
is
almost
always
the
doughty
douglas
england
is
merry
england
all
the
gold
is
red
and
all
the
ladies
are
gay
the
principal
distinction
between
the
lay
of
horatius
and
the
lay
of
the
lake
regillus
is
that
the
former
is
meant
to
be
purely
roman
while
the
latter
though
national
in
its
general
spirit
has
a
slight
tincture
of
greek
learning
and
of
greek
superstition
the
story
of
the
tarquins
as
it
has
come
down
to
us
appears
to
have
been
compiled
from
the
works
of
several
popular
poets
and
one
at
least
of
those
poets
appears
to
have
visited
the
greek
colonies
in
italy
if
not
greece
itself
and
to
have
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
homer
and
herodotus
many
of
the
most
striking
adventures
of
the
house
of
tarquin
before
lucretia
makes
her
appearance
have
a
greek
character
the
tarquins
themselves
are
represented
as
corinthian
nobles
of
the
great
house
of
the
bacchiadæ
driven
from
their
country
by
the
tyranny
of
that
cypselus
the
tale
of
whose
strange
escape
herodotus
has
related
with
incomparable
simplicity
and
liveliness
livy
and
dionysius
tell
us
that
when
tarquin
the
proud
was
asked
what
was
the
best
mode
of
governing
a
conquered
city
he
replied
only
by
beating
down
with
his
staff
all
the
tallest
poppies
in
his
garden
this
is
exactly
what
herodotus
in
the
passage
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
relates
of
the
counsel
given
to
periander
the
son
of
cypselus
the
stratagem
by
which
the
town
of
gabii
is
brought
under
the
power
of
the
tarquins
is
again
obviously
copied
from
herodotus
the
embassy
of
the
young
tarquins
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
is
just
such
a
story
as
would
be
told
by
a
poet
whose
head
was
full
of
the
greek
mythology
and
the
ambiguous
answer
returned
by
apollo
is
in
the
exact
style
of
the
prophecies
which
according
to
herodotus
lured
croesus
to
destruction
then
the
character
of
the
narrative
changes
from
the
first
mention
of
lucretia
to
the
retreat
of
porsena
nothing
seems
to
be
borrowed
from
foreign
sources
the
villainy
of
sextus
the
suicide
of
his
victim
the
revolution
the
death
of
the
sons
of
brutus
the
defence
of
the
bridge
musius
burning
his
hand
cloelia
swimming
through
tiber
seem
to
be
all
strictly
roman
but
when
we
have
done
with
the
tuscan
wars
and
enter
upon
the
war
with
the
latines
we
are
again
struck
by
the
greek
air
of
the
story
the
battle
of
the
lake
regillus
is
in
all
respects
a
homeric
battle
except
that
the
combatants
ride
astride
on
their
horses
instead
of
driving
chariots
the
mass
of
fighting
men
is
hardly
mentioned
the
leaders
single
each
other
out
and
engage
hand
to
hand
the
great
object
of
the
warriors
on
both
sides
is
as
in
the
iliad
to
obtain
possession
of
the
spoils
and
bodies
of
the
slain
and
several
circumstances
are
related
which
forcibly
remind
us
of
the
great
slaughter
round
the
corpses
of
sarpedon
and
patroclus
but
there
is
one
circumstance
which
deserves
especial
notice
both
the
war
of
troy
and
the
war
of
regillus
were
caused
by
the
licentious
passions
of
young
princes
who
were
therefore
peculiarly
bound
not
to
be
sparing
of
their
own
persons
on
the
day
of
battle
now
the
conduct
of
sextus
at
regillus
as
described
by
livy
so
exactly
resembles
that
of
paris
as
described
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
book
of
the
iliad
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
the
resemblance
accidental
paris
appears
before
the
trojan
ranks
defying
the
bravest
greek
to
encounter
him
lines
from
the
iliad
in
greek
probably
those
translated
by
pope
as
to
the
van
before
the
sons
of
fame
whom
troy
sent
forth
the
beauteous
paris
came
livy
introduces
sextus
in
a
similar
manner
ferocem
juvenem
tarquinium
ostentantem
se
in
prima
exsulum
acie
menelaus
rushes
to
meet
paris
a
roman
noble
eager
for
vengeance
spurs
his
horse
towards
sextus
both
the
guilty
princes
are
instantly
more
lines
in
greek
pope
translation
being
menelaus
approaching
near
the
beauteous
champion
views
with
marks
of
fear
smit
with
a
conscious
sense
retires
behind
and
shuns
the
fate
he
well
deserv
to
find
tarquinius
says
livy
retro
in
agmen
suorum
infenso
cessit
hosti
if
this
be
a
fortuitous
coincidence
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
in
literature
in
the
following
poem
therefore
images
and
incidents
have
been
borrowed
not
merely
without
scruple
but
on
principle
from
the
incomparable
of
homer
the
popular
belief
at
rome
from
an
early
period
seems
to
have
been
that
the
event
of
the
great
day
of
regillus
was
decided
by
supernatural
agency
castor
and
pollux
it
was
said
had
fought
armed
and
mounted
at
the
head
of
the
legions
of
the
commonwealth
and
had
afterwards
carried
the
news
of
the
victory
with
incredible
speed
to
the
city
the
well
in
the
forum
at
which
they
had
alighted
was
pointed
out
near
the
well
rose
their
ancient
temple
a
great
festival
was
kept
to
their
honor
on
the
ides
of
quintilis
supposed
to
be
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
and
on
that
day
sumptuous
sacrifices
were
offered
to
them
at
the
public
charge
one
spot
on
the
margin
of
lake
regillus
was
regarded
during
many
ages
with
superstitious
awe
a
mark
resembling
in
shape
a
horse
hoof
was
discernible
in
the
volcanic
rock
and
this
mark
was
believed
to
have
been
made
by
one
of
the
celestial
chargers
how
the
legend
originated
can
not
now
be
ascertained
but
we
may
easily
imagine
several
ways
in
which
it
might
have
originated
nor
is
it
at
all
necessary
to
suppose
with
julius
frontinus
that
two
young
men
were
dressed
up
by
the
dictator
to
personate
the
sons
of
leda
it
is
probable
that
livy
is
correct
when
he
says
that
the
roman
general
in
the
hour
of
peril
vowed
a
temple
to
castor
if
so
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
the
multitude
should
ascribe
the
victory
to
the
favor
of
the
twin
gods
when
such
was
the
prevailing
sentiment
any
man
who
chose
to
declare
that
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
and
slaughter
he
had
seen
two
godlike
forms
on
white
horses
scattering
the
latines
would
find
ready
credence
we
know
indeed
that
in
modern
times
a
very
similar
story
actually
found
credence
among
a
people
much
more
civilized
than
the
romans
of
the
fifth
century
before
christ
a
chaplain
of
cortes
writing
about
thirty
years
after
the
conquest
of
mexico
in
an
age
of
printing
presses
libraries
universities
scholars
logicians
jurists
and
statesmen
had
the
face
to
assert
that
in
one
engagement
against
the
indians
james
had
appeared
on
a
gray
horse
at
the
head
of
the
castilian
adventurers
many
of
those
adventurers
were
living
when
this
lie
was
printed
one
of
them
honest
bernal
diaz
wrote
an
account
of
the
expedition
he
had
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
against
the
legend
but
he
seems
to
have
distrusted
even
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
he
says
that
he
was
in
the
battle
and
that
he
saw
a
gray
horse
with
a
man
on
his
back
but
that
the
man
was
to
his
thinking
francesco
de
morla
and
not
the
apostle
james
nevertheless
bernal
adds
it
may
be
that
the
person
on
the
gray
horse
was
the
glorious
apostle
james
and
that
i
sinner
that
i
am
was
unworthy
to
see
him
the
romans
of
the
age
of
cincinatus
were
probably
quite
as
credulous
as
the
spanish
subjects
of
charles
the
fifth
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
the
appearance
of
castor
and
pollux
may
be
become
an
article
of
faith
before
the
generation
which
had
fought
at
regillus
had
passed
away
nor
could
anything
be
more
natural
than
that
the
poets
of
the
next
age
should
embellish
this
story
and
make
the
celestial
horsemen
bear
the
tidings
of
victory
to
rome
many
years
after
the
temple
of
the
twin
gods
had
been
built
in
the
forum
an
important
addition
was
made
to
the
ceremonial
by
which
the
state
annually
testified
its
gratitude
for
their
protection
quintus
fabius
and
publius
decius
were
elected
censors
at
a
momentous
crisis
it
had
become
absolutely
necessary
that
the
classification
of
the
citizens
should
be
revised
on
that
classification
depended
the
distribution
of
political
power
party
spirit
ran
high
and
the
republic
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
falling
under
the
dominion
either
of
a
narrow
oligarchy
or
of
an
ignorant
and
headstrong
rabble
under
such
circumstances
the
most
illustrious
patrician
and
the
most
illustrious
plebeian
of
the
age
were
entrusted
with
the
office
of
arbitrating
between
the
angry
factions
and
they
performed
their
arduous
task
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
honest
and
reasonable
men
one
of
their
reforms
was
the
remodelling
of
the
equestrian
order
and
having
effected
this
reform
they
determined
to
give
to
their
work
a
sanction
derived
from
religion
in
the
chivalrous
societies
of
modern
times
societies
which
have
much
more
than
may
at
first
sight
appear
in
common
with
with
the
equestrian
order
of
rome
it
has
been
usual
to
invoke
the
special
protection
of
some
saint
and
to
observe
his
day
with
peculiar
solemnity
thus
the
companions
of
the
garter
wear
the
image
of
george
depending
from
their
collars
and
meet
on
great
occasions
in
george
chapel
thus
when
louis
the
fourteenth
instituted
a
new
order
of
chivalry
for
the
rewarding
of
military
merit
he
commended
it
to
the
favor
of
his
own
glorified
ancestor
and
patron
and
decreed
that
all
the
members
of
the
fraternity
should
meet
at
the
royal
palace
on
the
feast
of
louis
should
attend
the
king
to
chapel
should
hear
mass
and
should
subsequently
hold
their
great
annual
assembly
there
is
a
considerable
resemblance
between
this
rule
of
the
order
of
louis
and
the
rule
which
fabius
and
decius
made
respecting
the
roman
knights
it
was
ordained
that
a
grand
muster
and
inspection
of
the
equestrian
body
should
be
part
of
the
ceremonial
performed
on
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
regillus
in
honor
of
castor
and
pollux
the
two
equestrian
gods
all
the
knights
clad
in
purple
and
crowned
with
olive
were
to
meet
at
a
temple
of
mars
in
the
suburbs
thence
they
were
to
ride
in
state
to
the
forum
where
the
temple
of
the
twins
stood
this
pageant
was
during
several
centuries
considered
as
one
of
the
most
splendid
sights
of
rome
in
the
time
of
dionysius
the
cavalcade
sometimes
consisted
of
five
thousand
horsemen
all
persons
of
fair
repute
and
easy
fortune
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
censors
who
instituted
this
august
ceremony
acted
in
concert
with
the
pontiffs
to
whom
by
the
constitution
of
rome
the
superintendence
of
the
public
worship
belonged
and
it
is
probable
that
those
high
religious
functionaries
were
as
usual
fortunate
enough
to
find
in
their
books
or
traditions
some
warrant
for
the
innovation
the
following
poem
is
supposed
to
have
been
made
for
this
great
occasion
songs
we
know
were
chanted
at
religious
festivals
of
rome
from
an
early
period
indeed
from
so
early
a
period
that
some
of
the
sacred
verses
were
popularly
ascribed
to
numa
and
were
utterly
unintelligible
in
the
age
of
augustus
in
the
second
punic
war
a
great
feast
was
held
in
honor
of
juno
and
a
song
was
sung
in
her
praise
this
song
was
extant
when
livy
wrote
and
though
exceedingly
rugged
and
uncouth
seemed
to
him
not
wholly
destitute
of
merit
a
song
as
we
learn
from
horace
was
part
of
the
established
ritual
at
the
great
secular
jubilee
it
is
therefore
likely
that
the
censors
and
pontiffs
when
they
had
resolved
to
add
a
grand
procession
of
knights
to
the
other
solemnities
annually
performed
on
the
ides
of
quintilis
would
call
in
the
aid
of
a
poet
such
a
poet
would
naturally
take
for
his
subject
the
battle
of
regillus
the
appearance
of
the
twin
gods
and
the
institution
of
their
festival
he
would
find
abundant
materials
in
the
ballads
of
his
predecessors
and
he
would
make
free
use
of
the
scanty
stock
of
greek
learning
which
he
had
himself
acquired
he
would
probably
introduce
some
wise
and
holy
pontiff
enjoining
the
magnificent
ceremonial
which
after
a
long
interval
had
at
length
been
adopted
if
the
poem
succeeded
many
persons
would
commit
it
to
memory
parts
of
it
would
be
sung
to
the
pipe
at
banquets
it
would
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
the
great
posthumian
house
which
numbered
among
its
many
images
that
of
the
dictator
aulus
the
hero
of
regillus
the
orator
who
in
the
following
generation
pronounced
the
funeral
panegyric
over
the
remains
of
lucius
posthumius
megellus
thrice
consul
would
borrow
largely
from
the
lay
and
thus
some
passages
much
disfigured
would
probably
find
their
way
into
the
chronicles
which
were
afterwards
in
the
hands
of
dionysius
and
livy
antiquaries
differ
widely
as
to
the
situation
of
the
field
of
battle
the
opinion
of
those
who
suppose
that
the
armies
met
near
cornufelle
between
frascati
and
the
monte
porzio
is
at
least
plausible
and
has
been
followed
in
the
poem
as
to
the
details
of
the
battle
it
has
not
been
thought
desirable
to
adhere
minutely
to
the
accounts
which
have
come
down
to
us
those
accounts
indeed
differ
widely
from
each
other
and
in
all
probability
differ
as
widely
from
the
ancient
poem
from
which
they
were
originally
derived
it
is
unnecessary
to
point
out
the
obvious
imitations
of
the
iliad
which
have
been
purposely
introduced
the

of

little
they
think
how
sternly
that
day
the
trumpets
pealed
how
in
the
slippery
swamp
of

reeled
how
wolves
came
with
fierce
gallops

crows
on

and
peck
the
eyes
of

how
thick
the

lay
scattered

how
through

gates
of

raved
the

stream
of

bubbled

the

were

years
gone
by
an
hundred
and

and
thirteen
that
summer
a
virginius
was

in

the

was
stout
aulus
of
the

the
herald
of

from

came
in

the
herald
of

latines
passed
through

the
herald
of
the
latines
did
in
our
forum
stand
and
there
he
did
his
office
a

in

vi
hear
senators
and
people
of
the
good
town
of

the
thirty
cities
charge
you
to
bring

if
ye
still
be
stubborn
to

the
tarquins
wrong
the
thirty
cities
warn
you
look
your

be

vii
then
spake
the
consul
aulus
he
spake
a
bitter
jest
once
the
jays
sent
a
message
unto
the
eagle
nest
now
yield
thou
up
thine
eyrie
unto
the

come
forth
valiantly

face
the

forth
looked
in
wrath

and
jay
soon
as
they

viii
the
herald
of

hath
hied

now
harken
conscript

to
that
which

then
choose
we
a

all

knows
how
deeply
the
sword
of
aulus
bites
and
all
our

calls
him
the

then
let
him
be
dictator
for
six
months
and
no
more
and
have
a

so
aulus
was

made
æbutius

thick
battle
pressed
æbutius
smote
mamilius
so
fiercely
on
the
shield
that
the
great
lord
of
tusculum
rolled
on
the
field
mamilius
smote
æbutius
with
a
good
aim
and
true
just
where
the
next
and
shoulder
join
and
pierced
him
through
and
through
and
brave
æbutius
elva
fell
swooning
to
the
ground
but
a
thick
wall
of
bucklers
encompassed
him
around
his
clients
from
the
battle
bare
him
some
little
space
and
filled
a
helm
from
the
dark
lake
and
bathed
his
brow
and
face
and
when
at
last
he
opened
his
swimming
eyes
to
light
men
say
the
earliest
words
he
spake
was
friends
how
goes
the
fight
xvii
but
meanwhile
in
the
centre
great
deeds
of
arms
were
wrought
there
aulus
the
dictator
and
there
valerius
fought
aulus
with
his
good
broadsword
a
bloody
passage
cleared
to
where
amidst
the
thickest
foes
he
saw
the
long
white
beard
flat
lighted
that
good
broadsword
upon
proud
tarquin
head
he
dropped
the
lance
he
dropped
the
reins
he
fell
as
fall
the
dead
down
aulus
springs
to
slay
him
with
eyes
like
coals
of
fire
but
faster
titus
hath
sprung
down
and
hath
bestrode
his
sire
latian
captains
roman
knights
fast
down
to
earth
they
spring
and
hand
to
hand
they
fight
on
foot
around
the
ancient
king
first
titus
gave
tall
cæso
a
death
wound
in
the
face
tall
cæso
was
the
bravest
man
of
the
brave
fabian
race
aulus
slew
rex
of
gabii
the
priest
of
juno
shrine
valerius
smote
down
julius
of
rome
great
julian
line
julius
who
left
his
mansion
high
on
the
velian
hill
and
through
all
turns
of
weal
and
woe
followed
proud
tarquin
still
now
right
across
proud
tarquin
a
corpse
was
julius
laid
and
titus
groaned
with
rage
and
grief
and
at
valerius
made
valerius
struck
at
titus
and
lopped
off
half
his
crest
but
titus
stabbed
valerius
a
span
deep
in
the
breast
like
a
mast
snapped
by
the
tempest
valerius
reeled
and
fell
ah
woe
is
me
for
the
good
house
that
loves
the
people
well
then
shouted
loud
the
latines
and
with
one
rush
they
bore
the
struggling
romans
backward
three
lances
length
and
more
and
up
they
took
proud
tarquin
and
laid
him
on
a
shield
and
four
strong
yeomen
bare
him
still
senseless
from
the
field
xviii
but
fiercer
grew
the
fighting
around
valerius
dead
for
titus
dragged
him
by
the
foot
and
aulus
by
the
head
on
latines
on
quoth
titus
see
how
the
rebels
fly
romans
stand
firm
quoth
aulus
and
win
this
fight
or
die
they
must
not
give
valerius
to
raven
and
to
kite
for
aye
valerius
loathed
the
wrong
and
aye
upheld
the
right
and
for
your
wives
and
babies
in
the
front
rank
he
fell
now
play
the
men
for
the
good
house
that
loves
the
people
well
xix
then
tenfold
round
the
body
the
roar
of
battle
rose
like
the
roar
of
a
burning
forest
when
a
strong
north
wind
blows
now
backward
and
now
forward
rocked
furiously
the
fray
till
none
could
see
valerius
and
none
wist
where
he
lay
for
shivered
arms
and
ensigns
were
heaped
there
in
a
mound
and
corpses
stiff
and
dying
men
that
writhed
and
gnawed
the
ground
and
wounded
horses
kicking
and
snorting
purple
foam
right
well
did
such
a
couch
befit
a
consular
of
rome
xx
but
north
looked
the
dictator
north
looked
he
long
and
hard
and
spake
to
caius
cossus
the
captain
of
his
guard
caius
of
all
the
romans
thou
hast
the
keenest
sight
say
what
through
yonder
storm
of
dust
comes
from
the
latian
right
xxi
then
answered
caius
cossus
i
see
an
evil
sight
the
banner
of
proud
tusculum
comes
from
the
latian
right
i
see
the
pluméd
horsemen
and
far
before
the
rest
i
see
the
charger
i
see
the
purple
vest
i
see
the
golden
helmet
that
shines
far
off
like
flame
so
ever
rides
mamilius
prince
of
the
latian
name
xxii
now
hearken
caius
cossus
spring
on
thy
horse
back
ride
as
the
wolves
of
apennine
were
all
upon
thy
track
haste
to
our
southward
battle
and
never
draw
thy
rein
until
thou
find
herminius
and
bid
hime
come
amain
xxiii
so
aulus
spake
and
turned
him
again
to
that
fierce
strife
and
caius
cossus
mounted
and
rode
for
death
and
life
loud
clanged
beneath
his
the
helmets
of
the
dead
and
many
a
curdling
pool
of
blood
splashed
him
heel
to
head
so
came
he
far
to
southward
where
fought
the
roman
host
against
the
banners
of
the
marsh
and
banners
of
the
coast
like
corn
before
the
sickle
the
stout
laninians
fell
beneath
the
edge
of
the
true
sword
that
kept
the
bridge
so
well
xxiv
herminius
aulus
greets
thee
he
bids
thee
come
with
speed
to
help
our
central
battle
for
sore
is
there
our
need
there
wars
the
youngest
tarquin
and
there
the
crest
of
flame
the
tusculan
mamilius
prince
of
the
latian
name
valerius
hath
fallen
fighting
in
front
of
our
array
and
aulus
of
the
seventy
fields
alone
upholds
the
day
xxv
herminius
beat
his
bosom
but
never
a
word
he
spake
he
clapped
his
hand
on
auster
mane
he
gave
the
reins
a
shake
away
away
went
auster
like
an
arrow
from
the
bow
black
auster
was
the
fleetest
steed
from
aufidus
to
po
xxvi
right
glad
were
all
the
romans
who
in
that
hour
of
dread
against
great
odds
bare
up
the
war
around
valerius
dead
when
from
the
south
the
cheering
rose
with
a
mighty
swell
herminius
comes
herminius
who
kept
the
bridge
so
well
xxvii
mamilius
spied
herminius
and
dashed
across
the
way
herminius
i
have
sought
thee
through
many
a
bloody
day
one
of
us
two
herminius
shall
never
more
go
home
i
will
lay
on
for
tusculum
and
lay
thou
on
for
rome
xxviii
all
round
them
paused
the
battle
while
met
in
mortal
fray
the
roman
and
the
tusculan
the
horses
black
and
gray
herminius
smote
mamilius
through
and
through
breast
and
fast
flowed
out
the
purple
blood
over
the
purple
vest
mamilius
smote
herminius
through
and
through
head
and
side
by
side
those
chiefs
of
pride
together
fell
down
dead
down
fell
they
dead
together
in
a
great
lake
of
gore
and
still
stood
all
who
saw
them
fall
while
men
might
count
a
score
xxix
fast
fast
with
heels
wild
spurning
the
charger
fled
he
burst
through
ranks
of
fighting
men
he
sprang
heaps
of
dead
his
bridle
far
his
flanks
all
blood
and
foam
he
sought
the
southern
mountains
the
mountains
of
his
home
the
pass
was
steep
and
rugged
the
wolves
they
howled
and
whined
but
he
ran
like
a
whirlwind
up
the
pass
and
he
left
the
wolves
behind
through
many
a
startled
hamlet
thundered
his
flying
feet
he
rushed
through
the
gate
of
tusculum
he
rushed
up
the
long
white
street
he
rushed
by
tower
and
temple
and
paused
not
from
his
race
till
he
stood
before
his
master
door
in
the
stately
and
straightway
round
him
gathered
a
pale
and
trembling
crowd
and
when
they
knew
him
cries
of
rage
brake
forth
and
wailing
loud
and
women
rent
their
tresses
for
their
great
prince
fall
and
old
men
girt
on
their
old
swords
and
went
to
man
the
wall
xxx
but
like
a
graven
image
black
auster
kept
his
place
and
ever
wistfully
he
looked
into
his
master
face
the
that
daily
with
pats
and
fond
caresses
the
young
herminia
washed
and
combed
and
twined
in
even
tresses
and
decked
with
colored
ribbons
from
her
own
gay
attire
hung
sadly
her
father
corpse
in
carnage
and
in
mire
forth
with
a
shout
sprang
titus
and
seized
black
auster
rein
then
aulus
sware
a
fearful
oath
and
ran
at
him
amain
the
furies
of
thy
brother
with
me
and
mine
abide
if
one
of
your
accursed
house
upon
black
auster
ride
as
on
a
alpine
from
heaven
comes
down
the
flame
full
on
the
neck
of
titus
the
blade
of
aulus
came
and
out
the
red
blood
spouted
in
a
wide
arch
and
tall
as
spouts
a
fountain
in
the
court
of
some
rich
capuan
hall
the
knees
of
all
the
latines
were
loosened
with
dismay
when
dead
on
dead
herminius
the
bravest
tarquin
lay
xxxi
and
aulus
the
dictator
stroked
auster
raven
mane
with
heed
he
looked
unto
the
girths
with
heed
unto
the
rein
now
bear
me
well
black
auster
into
yon
thick
array
and
thou
and
i
will
have
revenge
for
thy
good
lord
this
day
xxxii
so
spake
he
and
was
buckling
tighter
black
auster
band
when
he
was
aware
of
a
princely
pair
that
rode
at
his
right
hand
so
like
they
were
no
mortal
might
one
from
other
know
white
as
snow
their
armor
was
their
steeds
were
white
as
snow
never
on
earthly
anvil
did
such
rare
armor
gleam
and
never
did
such
gallant
steeds
drink
of
an
earthly
stream
xxxiii
and
all
who
saw
them
trembled
and
pale
grew
every
cheek
and
aulus
the
dictator
scarce
gathered
voice
to
speak
say
by
what
name
men
call
you
what
city
is
your
home
and
wherefore
ride
ye
in
such
guise
before
the
ranks
of
rome
xxxiv
by
many
names
men
call
us
in
many
lands
we
dwell
well
samothracia
knows
us
cyrene
knows
us
well
our
house
in
gay
tarentum
is
hung
each
morn
with
flowers
high
the
masts
of
syracuse
our
marble
portal

but
by
the
proud
eurotas
is
our
dear
native
home
and
for
the
right
we
come
to
fight
before
the
ranks
of
rome
xxxv
so
answered
those
strange
horsemen
and
each
couched
low
his
spear
and
forthwith
all
the
ranks
of
rome
were
bold
and
of
good
cheer
and
on
the
thirty
armies
came
wonder
and
affright
and
ardea
wavered
on
the
left
and
cora
on
the
right
rome
to
the
charge
cried
aulus
the
foe
begins
to
yield
charge
for
the
hearth
of

charge
for
the
golden
shield
let
no
man
stop
to
plunder
but
slay
and
slay
and
slay
the
gods
who
live
forever
are
on
our
side
xxxvi
then
the
fierce
from
earth
to
heaven
arose
the
kites
know
well
the
long
stern
swell
that
bids
the
romans
close
then
the
good
sword
of
aulus
was
lifted
up
to
slay
then
like
a
crag
down
apennine
rushed
auster
through
the
fray
but
under
those
strange
horsemen
still
thicker
lay
the
slain
and
after
those
strange
horses
black
auster
toiled
in
vain
behind
them
rome
long
battle
came
rolling
on
the
foe
ensigns
dancing
wild
above

all
in

so
comes
the
po
in
upon
the
celtic
plain
so
comes
the
squall
blacker
than
night
upon
the
adrian
main
now
by
our
sire
quirinus
it
was
a
goodly
sight
to
see
the
thirty
standards
swept
down
the
tide
of
flight
so
flies
the
spray
of
adria
when
the
black
squall
doth
blow
so
in
the
spin
down
the
whirling

false
sextus
to
the
mountains
turned
first
his
horse

and
fast
fled
ferentinum
and
fast
lanuvium
fled
the
horsemen
of
nomentus
spurred
hard
out
of
the
fray
the
footmen
of
velitræ
threw
shield
and
spear
away
and
underfoot
was
trampled
amidst
the
mud
and
gore
the
banner
of
proud
tusculum
that
never
stooped
before
and
down
went
flavius

led
his
stately
ranks
from

wriggling
in

he
died
like
a
worm
beneath
the
wheel
and
fliers
and
pursuers
were
mingled
in
a
mass
and
far
away
the
battle
went
roaring
through
the
pass
xxxvii
semponius
atratinus
sat
in
the
eastern

beside
him
were
three
fathers

in

and
all
around

high
above

stood
a
great
throng
of
people
but
sad
and
silent
all
young
lads
and
stooping
elders
that

for
the
rushing
of
from

east
the
mist

was
rising
the

was
hastening
down

he
was
aware

pricking
towards
the

so
like
they
were

burst
from

a
shout

shook
the

some
ran
north

some
ran
south
crying
the

no

only
in
subordinate
posts
a
minstrel
therefore
who
wished
to
celebrate
the
early
triumphs
of
his
country
could
hardly
take
any
but
patricians
for
his
heroes
the
warriors
who
are
mentioned
in
the
two
preceding
lays
horatius
lartius
herminius
aulus
posthumius
æbutius
elva
sempronius
atratinus
valerius
poplicola
were
all
members
of
the
dominant
order
and
a
poet
who
was
singing
their
praises
whatever
his
own
political
opinions
might
be
would
naturally
abstain
from
insulting
the
class
to
which
they
belonged
and
from
reflecting
on
the
system
which
had
placed
such
men
at
the
head
of
the
legions
of
the
commonwealth
but
there
was
a
class
of
compositions
in
which
the
great
families
were
by
no
means
so
courteously
treated
no
parts
of
early
roman
history
are
richer
with
poetical
coloring
than
those
which
relate
to
the
long
contest
between
the
privileged
houses
and
the
commonality
the
population
of
rome
was
from
a
very
early
period
divided
into
hereditary
castes
which
indeed
readily
united
to
repel
foreign
enemies
but
which
regarded
each
other
during
many
years
with
bitter
animosity
between
those
castes
there
was
a
barrier
hardly
less
strong
than
that
which
at
venice
parted
the
members
of
the
great
council
from
their
countrymen
in
some
respects
indeed
the
line
which
separated
an
icilius
or
a
duilius
from
a
posthumius
or
a
fabius
was
even
more
deeply
marked
than
that
which
separated
the
rower
of
gondola
from
a
contarini
or
a
morosini
at
venice
the
distinction
was
merely
civil
at
rome
it
was
both
civil
and
religious
among
the
grievances
under
which
the
plebeians
suffered
three
were
felt
as
peculiarly
severe
they
were
excluded
from
the
highest
magistracies
they
were
excluded
from
all
share
in
the
public
lands
and
they
were
ground
down
to
the
dust
by
partial
and
barbarous
legislation
touching
pecuniary
contracts
the
ruling
class
in
rome
was
a
moneyed
class
and
it
made
and
administered
the
laws
with
a
view
solely
to
its
own
interest
thus
the
relation
between
lender
and
borrower
was
mixed
up
with
the
relation
between
sovereign
and
subject
the
great
men
held
a
large
portion
of
the
community
in
dependence
by
means
of
advances
at
enormous
usury
the
law
of
debt
framed
by
creditors
and
for
the
protection
of
creditors
was
the
host
horrible
that
has
ever
been
known
among
men
the
liberty
and
even
the
life
of
the
insolvent
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
patrician
children
often
became
slaves
in
consequence
of
the
misfortunes
of
their
parents
the
debtor
was
imprisoned
not
in
a
public
jail
under
the
care
of
impartial
public
functionaries
but
in
a
private
workhouse
belonging
to
the
creditor
frightful
stories
were
told
respecting
these
dungeons
it
was
said
that
torture
and
brutal
violation
were
common
that
tight
stocks
heavy
chains
scanty
measures
of
food
were
used
to
punish
wretches
guilty
of
nothing
but
poverty
and
that
brave
soldiers
whose
breasts
were
covered
with
honorable
scars
were
often
marked
still
more
deeply
on
the
back
by
the
scourges
of
usurers
the
plebeians
were
however
not
wholly
without
constitutional
rights
from
an
early
period
they
had
been
admitted
to
some
share
of
political
power
they
were
enrolled
each
in
his
century
and
were
allowed
a
share
considerable
though
not
proportioned
to
their
numerical
strength
in
the
disposal
of
those
high
dignities
from
which
they
were
themselves
excluded
thus
their
position
bore
some
resemblance
to
that
of
the
irish
catholics
during
the
interval
between
the
year
and
the
year
the
plebeians
had
also
the
privilege
of
annually
appointing
officers
named
tribunes
who
had
no
active
share
in
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
but
who
by
degree
acquired
a
power
formidable
even
to
the
ablest
and
most
resolute
consuls
and
dictators
the
person
of
the
tribune
was
inviolable
and
though
he
could
directly
effect
little
he
could
obstruct
everything
during
more
than
a
century
after
the
institution
of
the
tribuneship
the
commons
struggled
manfully
for
the
removal
of
the
grievances
under
which
they
labored
and
in
spite
of
many
checks
and
reverses
succeeded
in
wringing
concession
after
concession
from
the
stubborn
aristocracy
at
length
in
the
year
of
the
city
both
parties
mustered
their
whole
strength
for
their
last
and
most
desperate
conflict
the
popular
and
active
tribune
caius
licinius
proposed
the
three
memorable
laws
which
are
called
by
his
name
and
which
were
intended
to
redress
the
three
great
evils
of
which
the
plebeians
complained
he
was
supported
with
eminent
ability
and
firmness
by
his
colleague
lucius
sextius
the
struggle
appears
to
have
been
the
fiercest
that
every
in
any
community
terminated
without
an
appeal
to
arms
if
such
a
contest
had
raged
in
any
greek
city
the
streets
would
have
run
with
blood
but
even
in
the
paroxysms
of
faction
the
roman
retained
his
gravity
his
respect
for
law
and
his
tenderness
for
the
lives
of
his
fellow
citizens
year
after
year
licinius
and
sextius
were
reëlected
tribunes
year
after
year
if
the
narrative
which
has
come
down
to
us
is
to
be
trusted
they
continued
to
exert
to
the
full
extent
their
power
of
stopping
the
whole
machine
of
government
no
curule
magistrates
could
be
chosen
no
military
muster
could
be
held
we
know
too
little
of
the
state
of
rome
in
those
days
to
be
able
to
conjecture
how
during
that
long
anarchy
the
peace
was
kept
and
ordinary
justice
administered
between
man
and
man
the
animosity
of
both
parties
rose
to
the
greatest
height
the
excitement
we
may
well
suppose
would
have
been
peculiarly
intense
at
the
annual
election
of
tribunes
on
such
occasions
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
great
families
did
all
that
could
be
done
by
threats
and
caresses
to
break
the
union
of
the
plebeians
that
union
however
proved
indissoluble
at
length
the
good
cause
triumphed
the
licinian
laws
were
carried
lucius
sextius
was
the
first
plebeian
consul
caius
licinius
the
third
the
results
of
this
great
change
were
singularly
happy
and
glorious
two
centuries
of
prosperity
harmony
and
victory
followed
the
reconciliation
of
the
orders
men
who
remembered
rome
engaged
in
waging
petty
wars
almost
within
sight
of
the
capitol
lived
to
see
her
the
mistress
of
italy
while
the
disabilities
of
the
plebeians
continued
she
was
scarcely
able
to
maintain
her
ground
against
the
volscians
and
hernicans
when
those
disabilities
were
removed
she
rapidly
became
more
than
a
match
for
carthage
and
macedon
during
the
great
licinian
contest
the
plebeian
poets
were
doubtless
not
silent
even
in
modern
times
songs
have
been
by
no
means
without
influence
on
public
affairs
and
we
may
therefore
infer
that
in
a
society
where
printing
was
unknown
and
where
books
were
rare
a
pathetic
or
humorous
must
have
produced
effects
such
as
we
can
but
faintly
conceive
it
is
certain
that
satirical
poems
were
common
at
rome
from
a
very
early
period
the
rustics
who
lived
at
a
distance
from
the
seat
of
government
and
took
little
part
in
the
strife
of
factions
gave
vent
to
their
petty
local
animosities
in
coarse
fescennine
verse
the
lampoons
of
the
city
were
doubtless
of
a
higher
order
and
their
sting
was
early
felt
by
the
nobility
for
in
the
twelve
tables
long
before
the
time
of
the
licinian
laws
a
severe
punishment
was
denounced
against
the
citizen
who
should
compose
or
recite
verses
reflecting
on
another
satire
is
indeed
the
only
sort
of
composition
in
which
the
latin
poets
whose
works
have
come
down
to
us
were
not
mere
imitators
of
foreign
models
and
it
is
therefore
the
only
sort
of
composition
in
which
they
have
never
been
rivalled
it
was
not
like
their
tragedy
their
comedy
their
epic
and
lyric
poetry
a
hothouse
plant
which
in
return
for
assiduous
and
skilful
culture
gave
only
scanty
and
sickly
fruits
it
was
hardy
and
full
of
sap
and
in
all
the
various
juices
which
it
yielded
might
be
distinguished
the
flavor
of
the
ausonian
soil
satire
said
quinctilian
with
just
pride
is
all
our
own
satire
sprang
in
truth
naturally
from
the
constitution
of
the
roman
government
and
from
the
spirit
of
the
roman
people
and
though
at
length
subjected
to
metrical
rules
derived
from
greece
retained
to
the
last
an
essentially
roman
character
lucilius
was
the
earliest
satirist
whose
works
were
held
in
esteem
under
the
caesars
but
many
years
before
lucilius
was
born
nævius
had
been
flung
into
a
dungeon
and
guarded
there
with
circumstances
of
unusual
rigor
on
account
of
the
bitter
lines
in
which
he
had
attacked
the
great
caecilian
family
the
genius
and
spirit
of
the
roman
satirists
survived
the
liberty
of
their
country
and
were
not
extinguished
by
the
cruel
despotism
of
the
julian
and
flavian
emperors
the
great
poet
who
told
the
story
of
domitian
turbot
was
the
legitimate
successor
of
those
forgotten
minstrels
whose
songs
animated
the
factions
of
the
infant
republic
those
minstrels
as
niebuhr
has
remarked
appear
to
have
generally
taken
the
popular
side
we
can
hardly
be
mistaken
in
supposing
that
at
the
great
crisis
of
the
civil
conflict
they
employed
themselves
in
versifying
all
the
most
powerful
and
virulent
speeches
of
the
tribunes
and
in
heaping
abuse
on
the
leaders
of
the
aristocracy
every
personal
defect
every
domestic
scandal
every
tradition
dishonorable
to
a
noble
house
would
be
sought
out
brought
into
notice
and
exaggerated
the
illustrious
head
of
the
aristocratical
party
marcus
furius
camillus
might
perhaps
be
in
some
measure
protected
by
his
venerable
age
and
by
the
memory
of
his
great
services
to
the
state
but
appius
claudius
crassus
enjoyed
no
such
immunity
he
was
descended
from
a
long
line
of
ancestors
distinguished
by
their
haughty
demeanor
and
by
the
inflexibility
with
which
they
had
withstood
all
the
demands
of
the
plebeian
order
while
the
political
conduct
and
the
deportment
of
the
claudian
nobles
drew
upon
them
the
fiercest
public
hatred
they
were
accused
of
wanting
if
any
credit
is
due
to
the
early
history
of
rome
a
class
of
qualities
which
in
a
military
commonwealth
is
sufficient
to
cover
a
multitude
of
offences
the
chiefs
of
the
family
appear
to
have
been
eloquent
versed
in
civil
business
and
learned
after
the
fashion
of
their
age
but
in
war
they
were
not
distinguished
by
skill
or
valor
some
of
them
as
if
conscious
where
their
weakness
lay
had
when
filling
the
highest
magistracies
taken
internal
administration
as
their
department
of
public
business
and
left
the
military
command
to
their
colleagues
one
of
them
had
been
entrusted
with
an
army
and
had
failed
ignominiously
none
of
them
had
been
honored
with
a
triumph
none
of
them
had
achieved
any
martial
exploit
such
as
those
by
which
lucius
quinctius
cincinnatus
titus
quinctius
capitolinus
aulus
cornelius
cossus
and
above
all
the
great
camillus
had
extorted
the
reluctant
esteem
of
the
multitude
during
the
licinian
conflict
appius
claudius
crassus
signalized
himself
by
the
ability
and
severity
with
which
he
harangued
against
the
two
great
agitators
he
would
naturally
therefore
be
the
favorite
mark
of
the
plebeian
satirists
nor
would
they
have
been
at
a
loss
to
find
a
point
on
which
he
was
open
to
attack
his
grandfather
called
like
himself
appius
claudius
had
left
a
name
as
much
detested
as
that
sextus
tarquinius
this
elder
appius
had
been
consul
more
than
seventy
years
before
the
introduction
of
the
licinian
laws
by
availing
himself
of
a
singular
crisis
in
public
feeling
he
had
obtained
the
consent
of
the
commons
to
the
abolition
of
the
tribuneship
and
had
been
the
chief
of
that
council
of
ten
to
which
the
whole
direction
of
the
state
had
been
committed
in
a
new
months
his
administration
had
become
universally
odious
it
had
been
swept
away
by
an
irresistible
outbreak
of
popular
fury
and
its
memory
was
still
held
in
abhorrence
by
the
whole
city
the
immediate
cause
of
the
downfall
of
this
execrable
government
was
said
to
have
been
an
attempt
made
by
appius
claudius
upon
the
chastity
of
a
beautiful
young
girl
of
humble
birth
the
story
ran
that
the
decemvir
unable
to
succeed
by
bribes
and
solicitations
resorted
to
an
outrageous
act
of
tyranny
a
vile
dependent
of
the
claudian
house
laid
claim
to
the
damsel
as
his
slave
the
cause
was
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
appius
the
wicked
magistrate
in
defiance
of
the
clearest
proofs
gave
judgment
for
the
claimant
but
the
girl
father
a
brave
soldier
saved
her
from
servitude
and
dishonor
by
stabbing
her
to
the
heart
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
forum
that
blow
was
the
signal
for
a
general
explosion
camp
and
city
rose
at
once
the
ten
were
pulled
down
the
tribuneship
was
reëstablished
and
appius
escaped
the
hands
of
the
executioner
only
by
a
voluntary
death
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
a
story
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
purposes
both
of
the
poet
and
of
the
demagogue
would
be
eagerly
seized
upon
by
minstrels
burning
with
hatred
against
the
patrician
order
against
the
claudian
house
and
especially
against
the
grandson
and
namesake
of
the
infamous
decemvir
in
order
that
the
reader
may
judge
fairly
of
these
fragments
of
the
lay
of

he
must
imagine
himself

at

moment
it
is
announced
that
a

a

calls
on

to

on

than
seventy

steals
his
loins
girt
up
to
run
with
speed
be
the
errand
what
it
may
and
the
smile
flickering
on
his
cheek
for
aught
his
lord
may
say
such
varlets
pimp
and
jest
for

among
the
lying

such

still
are

to

when

the

such

such
client
still
will
be
just
then
as
through
one
cloudless
chink
in
a
black
stormy
sky
shines
out
the
dewy
a
fair
young
girl
came
by
with
her
small
tablets
in
her
hand
and
her
satchel
on
her
arm
home
she
went
bounding
from
the
school
nor
dreamed
of
shame
or
harm
and
past
those
dreaded
axes
she
innocently
ran
with
bright
frank
brow
that
had
not
learned
to
blush
at
gaze
of
man
and
up
the
sacred
street
she
turned
and
as
she
danced
along
she
warbled
gayly
to
herself
lines
of
the
good
old
song
how
for
a
sport
the
princes
came
spurring
from
the
camp
and
found
lucrece
combing
the
fleece
under
the
midnight
lamp
the
maiden
sang
as
sings
the
lark
when
up
he
darts
his
flight
from
his
nest
in
the
green
april
corn
to
meet
the
morning
light
and
appius
heard
her
sweet
young
voice
and
saw
her
sweet
young
face
and
loved
her
with
the
accursed
love
of
his
accursed
race
and
all
along
the
forum
and
up
the
sacred
street
his
vulture
eye
pursued
the
trip
of
those
small
glancing
feet
over
the
alban
mountains
the
light
of
morning
broke
from
all
the
roofs
of
the
seven
hills
curled
the
thin
wreaths
of
smoke
the
were
opened
the
forum
all
alive
with
buyers
and
with
sellers
was
humming
like
a
hive
blithely
on
brass
and
timber
the
craftsman
stroke
was
ringing
and
blithely
her
panniers
the
was
singing
and
blithely
young
virginia
came
smiling
from
her
home
ah
woe
for
young
virginia
the
sweetest
maid
in
rome
with
her
small
tablets
in
her
hand
and
her
satchel
on
her
arm
forth
she
went
bounding
to
the
school
nor
dreamed
of
shame
or
harm
she
crossed
the
forum
shining
with
stalls
in
alleys
gay
and
just
had
reached
the
very
spot
whereon
i
stand
this
day
when
up
the
varlet
marcus
came
not
such
as
when
erewhile
he
crouched
behind
his
patron
heels
with
the
true
client
smile
he
came
with
lowering
forehead
swollen
features
and
clenched
fist
and
strode
across
virginia
path
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
hard
strove
the
frightened
maiden
and
screamed
with
look
aghast
and
at
her
scream
from
right
and
left
the
folk
came
running
fast
the
crispus
with
his
thin
silver
hairs
and
hanno
from
the
stately
booth
glittering
with
punic
wares
and
the
strong
smith
muræna
grasping
a
brand
and
volero
the
flesher
his
cleaver
in
his
hand
all
came
in
wrath
and
wonder
for
all
knew
that
fair
child
and
as
she
passed
them
twice
a
day
all
kissed
their
hands
and
smiled
and
the
strong
smith
muræna
gave
marcus
such
a
blow
the
caitiff
reeled
three
paces
back
and
let
the
maiden
go
yet
glared
he
fiercely
round
him
and
growled
in
harsh
fell
tone
she
mine
and
i
will
have
her
i
seek
but
for
mine
own
she
is
my
slave
born
in
my
house
and
stolen
away
and
sold
the
year
of
the
sore
sickness
ere
she
was
twelve
hours
old
was
in
the
sad
september
the
month
of
wail
and
fright
two
augers
were
borne
forth
that
morn
the
consul
died
ere
night
i
wait
on
appius
claudius
i
waited
on
his
sire
let
him
who
works
the
client
wrong
beware
the
patron
ire
so
spake
the
varlet
marcus
and
dread
and
silence
came
on
all
the
people
at
the
sound
of
the
great
claudian
name
for
then
there
was
no
tribune
to
speak
the
word
of
might
which
makes
the
rich
man
tremble
and
guards
the
poor
right
there
was
no
brave
licinius
no
honest
sixtius
then
but
all
the
city
in
great
fear
obeyed
the
wicked
ten
yet
ere
the
varlet
marcus
again
might
seize
the
maid
who
clung
tight
to
muræna
skirt
and
sobbed
and
shrieked
for
aid
forth
through
the
throng
of
gazers
the
young
icilius
pressed
and
stamped
his
foot
and
rent
his
gown
and
smote
upon
his
breast
and
sprang
upon
that
column
by
many
a
minstrel
sung
whereon
three
mouldering
helmets
three
rusting
swords
are
hung
and
beckoned
to
the
people
and
in
bold
voice
and
clear
poured
thick
and
fast
the
burning
words
which
tyrants
quake
to
hear
now
by
your
children
cradles
now
by
your
graves
be
men
quirites
or
be
forever
slaves
for
this
did
servius
give
us
laws
for
this
did
lucrece
bleed
for
this
was
the
great
vengeance
wrought
on
tarquin
evil
seed
for
this
did
those
false
sons
make
red
the
axes
of
their
sire
for
this
did
scævola
right
hand
hiss
in
the
tuscan
fire
shall
the
vile
awe
the
race
that
stormed
the
den
shall
we
who
could
not
brook
one
lord
crouch
to
the
wicked
ten
oh
for
that
ancient
spirit
which
curbed
the
senate
will
oh
for
the
tents
which
in
old
time
whitened
the
sacred
hill
in
those
brave
days
our
fathers
stood
firmly
side
by
side
they
faced
the
marcian
fury
they
tamed
the
fabian
pride
they
drove
the
fiercest
quinctius
an
outcast
forth
from
rome
they
sent
the
haughtiest
claudius
with
shivered
fasces
home
but
what
their
care
bequeathed
us
our
madness
flung
away
all
the
ripe
fruit
of
threescore
years
was
blighted
in
a
day
exult
ye
proud
patricians
the
fight
is
we
strove
for
honors
was
in
vain
for
freedom
is
no
more
no
crier
to
the
polling
summons
the
eager
throng
no
tribune
breathes
the
word
of
might
that
guards
the
weak
from
wrong
our
very
hearts
that
were
so
high
sink
down
beneath
your
will
riches
and
lands
and
power
and
state
ye
have
them
keep
them
still
still
keep
the
holy
fillets
still
keep
the
purple
gown
the
axes
and
the
curule
chair
the
car
and
laurel
crown
still
press
us
for
your
cohorts
and
when
the
fight
is
done
still
fill
your
garners
from
the
soil
which
our
good
swords
have
won
still
like
a
spreading
ulcer
which
may
not
cure
let
your
foul
usance
eat
away
the
substance
of
the
poor
still
let
your
haggard
debtors
bear
all
their
fathers
bore
still
let
your
dens
of
torment
be
noisome
as
of
yore
no
fire
when
tiber
freezes
no
air
in
heat
and
store
of
rods
for
backs
and
holes
for
feet
heap
heavier
still
the
fetters
bar
closer
still
the
grate
patient
as
sheep
we
yield
us
up
unto
your
cruel
hate
but
by
the
shades
beneath
us
and
by
the
gods
above
add
not
unto
your
cruel
hate
your
yet
more
cruel
love
have
ye
not
graceful
ladies
whose
spotless
lineage
springs
from
consuls
and
high
pontiffs
and
ancient
alban
kings
ladies
who
deign
not
on
our
paths
to
set
their
tender
feet
who
from
their
cars
look
down
with
scorn
upon
the
wondering
street
who
in
corinthian
mirrors
their
own
proud
smiles
behold
and
breathe
the
capuan
odors
and
shine
with
spanish
gold
then
leave
the
poor
plebeian
his
single
tie
to
life
the
sweet
sweet
love
of
daughter
of
sister
and
of
wife
the
gentle
speech
the
balm
for
all
that
his
vexed
soul
endures
the
kiss
in
which
he
half
forgets
even
such
a
yoke
as
yours
still
let
the
maiden
beauty
swell
the
father
breast
with
pride
still
let
the
bridegroom
arms
infold
an
unpolluted
bride
spare
us
the
inexpiable
wrong
the
unutterable
shame
that
turns
the
coward
heart
to
steel
the
sluggard
blood
to
flame
lest
when
our
latest
hope
is
fled
ye
taste
of
our
despair
and
learn
by
proof
in
some
wild
hour
how
much
the
wretched
dare
straightway
virginius
led
the
maid
a
little
space
aside
to
where
the
reeking
shambles
stood
piled
up
with
horn
and
hide
close
to
yon
low
dark
archway
where
in
a
crimson
flood
leaps
down
to
the
great
sewer
the
gurgling
stream
of
blood
hard
by
a
flesher
on
a
block
had
laid
his
whittle
down
virginius
caught
the
whittle
up
and
hid
it
in
his
gown
and
then
his
eyes
grew
very
dim
and
his
throat
began
to
swell
and
in
a
hoarse
changed
voice
he
spake
farewell
sweet
child
farewell
oh
how
i
loved
my
darling
though
stern
i
sometimes
be
to
thee
thou
i
was
not
so
who
could
be
so
to
thee
and
how
my
darling
loved
me
how
glad
she
was
to
hear
my
footstep
on
the
threshold
when
i
came
back
last
year
and
how
she
danced
with
pleasure
to
see
my
civic
crown
and
took
my
sword
and
hung
it
up
and
brought
me
forth
my
gown
now
all
those
things
are
over
yes
all
thy
pretty
ways
thy
needlework
thy
prattle
thy
snatches
of
old
lays
and
none
will
grieve
when
i
go
forth
or
smile
when
i
return
or
watch
beside
the
old
man
bed
or
weep
upon
his
urn
the
house
that
was
the
happiest
within
the
roman
walls
the
house
that
envied
not
the
wealth
of
capua
marble
halls
now
for
the
brightness
of
thy
smile
must
have
eternal
gloom
and
for
the
music
of
thy
voice
the
silence
of
the
tomb
the
time
is
come
see
how
he
points
his
eager
hand
this
way
see
how
his
eyes
gloat
on
thy
grief
like
a
kite
upon
the
prey
with
all
his
wit
he
little
deems
that
spurned
betrayed
bereft
thy
father
hath
in
his
despair
one
fearful
refuge
left
he
little
deems
that
in
this
hand
i
clutch
what
still
can
save
thy
gentle
youth
from
taunts
and
blows
the
portion
of
the
slave
yea
and
from
nameless
evil
that
passeth
taunt
and
blow
foul
outrage
which
thou
knowest
not
which
thou
shalt
never
know
then
clasp
me
round
the
neck
once
more
and
give
me
one
more
kiss
and
now
mine
own
dear
little
girl
there
is
no
way
but
this
with
that
he
lifted
high
the
steel
and
smote
her
in
the
side
and
in
her
blood
she
sank
to
earth
and
with
one
sob
she
died
then
for
a
little
moment
all
people
held
their
breath
and
through
the
crowded
forum
was
stillness
as
of
death
and
in
another
moment
brake
forth
from
one
and
all
a
cry
as
if
the
volscians
were
coming
the
wall
some
with
averted
faces
shrieking
fled
home
amain
some
ran
to
call
a
leech
and
some
ran
to
lift
the
slain
some
felt
her
lips
and
little
wrist
if
life
might
there
be
found
and
some
tore
up
their
garments
fast
and
strove
to
stanch
the
wound
in
vain
they
ran
and
felt
and
stanched
for
never
truer
blow
that
good
right
arm
had
dealt
in
fight
agains
a
volscian
foe
when
appius
claudius
saw
that
deed
he
shuddered
and
sank
down
and
hid
his
face
some
little
space
with
the
corner
of
his
gown
till
with
white
lips
and
bloodshot
eyes
virginius
tottered
nigh
and
stood
before
the
and
held
the
knife
on
high
oh
dwellers
in
the
nether
gloom
avengers
of
the
slain
by
this
dear
blood
i
cry
to
you
do
right
between
us
twain
and
even
as
appius
claudius
hath
dealt
by
me
and
mine
deal
you
by
appius
claudius
and
all
the
claudian
line
so
spake
the
slayer
of
his
child
and
turned
and
went
his
way
but
first
he
cast
one
haggard
glance
to
where
the
body
lay
and
writhed
and
groaned
a
fearful
groan
an
then
with
steadfast
feet
strode
right
across
the
unto
the
sacred
street
then
up
sprang
appius
claudius
stop
him
alive
or
dead
ten
thousand
pounds
of
copper
to
the
man
who
brings
his
head
he
looked
upon
his
clients
but
none
would
work
his
will
he
looked
upon
his
lictors
but
they
trembled
and
stood
still
and
as
virginius
through
the
press
his
way
in
silence
cleft
ever
the
mighty
multitude
fell
back
to
right
and
left
and
he
hath
passed
in
safety
unto
his
woeful
home
and
there
horse
to
tell
the
camp
what
deeds
are
done
in
rome
by
this
the
flood
of
people
was
swollen
from
every
side
and
streets
and
porches
round
were
filled
with
that
tide
and
close
around
the
body
gathered
a
little
train
of
them
that
were
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
slain
they
brought
a
bier
and
hung
it
with
many
a
cypress
crown
and
gently
they
uplifted
her
and
gently
laid
her
down
the
face
of
appius
claudius
wore
the
claudian
scowl
and
sneer
and
in
the
claudian
note
he
cried
what
doth
this
rabble
here
have
they
no
crafts
to
mind
at
home
that
hitherward
they
stray
ho
lictors
clear
the
and
fetch
the
corpse
away
the
voice
of
grief
and
fury
till
then
had
not
been
loud
but
a
deep
sullen
murmur
wandered
among
the
crowd
like
the
moaning
noise
that
goes
before
the
whirlwind
on
the
deep
or
the
growl
of
a
fierce
but
half
aroused
from
sleep
but
when
the
lictors
at
that
word
tall
yeomen
all
and
strong
each
with
his
axe
and
sheaf
of
twigs
went
down
into
the
throng
those
old
men
say
who
saw
that
day
of
sorrow
and
of
sin
that
in
the
roman
forum
was
never
such
a
din
the
wailing
hooting
cursing
the
howls
of
grief
and
hate
were
heard
beyond
the
pincian
hill
beyond
the
latin
gate
but
close
around
the
body
where
stood
the
little
train
of
them
that
were
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
slain
no
cries
were
there
but
teeth
set
fast
low
whispers
and
black
frowns
and
breaking
up
of
benches
and
girding
up
of
gowns
was
well
the
lictors
might
not
pierce
to
where
the
maiden
lay
else
surely
had
they
been
all
twelve
torn
limb
from
limb
that
day
right
glad
they
were
to
struggle
back
blood
streaming
from
their
heads
with
axes
all
in
splinters
and
raiment
all
in
shreads
then
appius
claudius
gnawed
his
lip
and
the
blood
left
his
cheek
and
thrice
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
and
thrice
he
strove
to
speak
and
thrice
the
tossing
forum
set
up
a
frightful
yell
see
see
thou
dog
what
thou
hast
done
and
hide
thy
shame
in
hell
thou
that
wouldst
make
our
maidens
slaves
must
first
make
slaves
of
men
tribunes
hurrah
for
trubunes
down
with
the
wicked
ten
and
straightway
thick
as
hailstones
came
whizzing
through
the
air
pebbles
and
bricks
and
potsherds
all
round
the
curule
chair
and
upon
appius
claudius
great
fear
and
trembling
came
for
never
was
a
claudius
yet
brave
against
aught
but
shame
though
the
great
houses
love
us
not
we
own
to
do
them
right
that
the
great
houses
all
save
one
have
borne
them
well
in
fight
still
caius
of
corioli
his
triumphs
and
his
wrongs
his
vengeance
and
his
mercy
live
in
our
songs
beneath
the
yoke
of
furius
oft
have
gaul
and
tuscan
bowed
and
rome
may
bear
the
pride
of
him
of
whom
herself
is
proud
but
evermore
a
claudius
shrinks
from
a
stricken
field
and
changes
color
like
a
maid
at
sight
of
sword
and
shield
the
claudian
triumphs
all
were
won
within
the
city
towers
the
claudian
yoke
was
never
pressed
on
any
necks
but
ours
a
cossus
like
a
wild
cat
springs
ever
at
the
face
a
fabius
rushes
like
a
boar
against
the
shouting
chase
but
the
vile
claudian
litter
raging
with
currish
spite
still
yelps
and
snaps
at
those
who
run
still
runs
from
those
who
smite

upon

home

while
yet
he
spake
and
looked
around
with
a
bewildered
stare
four
sturdy
lictors
put
their
necks
beneath
the
curule
chair
and
fourscore
clients
on
the
left
and
fourscore
on
the
right
arrayed
themselves
with
swords
and
staves
and
loins
girt
up
to
fight
but
though
without
or
staff
or
sword
so
furious
was
the
throng
that
scarce
the
train
with
might
and
main
could
bring
their
lord
along
twelve
times
the
crowd
made
at
him
five
times
they
seized
his

small
chance
was
his
to
rise
again

once
they
got
him
down
and
sharper
came
the
pelting
and
evermore
the
yell
tribunes
we
will
have
tribunes
rose
with
a
louder
swell
and
the
chair
tossed
as
tosses
a
bark
with
tattered
sail
when
raves
the
adriatic
beneath
an
eastern
gale
when
calabrian
are
lost
in
clouds
of
spume
and
the
great
has
donned
his
veil
of
inky
gloom
one
stone
hit
appius
in
the
mouth
and
one
beneath
the
ear
and
ere
he
reached
mount
palatine
he
swooned
with
pain
and
fear
his
cursed
head
that
he
was
wont
to
hold
so
high
with
pride
now
like
a
drunken
man
hung
down
and
swayed
from
side
to
side
and
when
his
stout
retainers
had
brought
him
to
his
door
his
face
and
neck
were
all
one
cake
of
filth
and
clotted
gore
as
appius
claudius
was
that
day
so
may
his
grandson
be
god
send
rome
one
such
other
sight
and
send
me
there
to
see
the
prophecy
of
capys
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
to
remind
any
reader
that
according
to
the
popular
tradition
romulus
after
he
had
slain
his
granduncle
amulius
and
restored
his
grandfather
numitor
determined
to
quit
alba
the
hereditary
domain
of
the
sylvian
princes
and
to
found
a
new
city
the
gods
it
was
added
vouchsafed
the
clearest
signs
of
the
favor
with
which
they
regarded
the
enterprise
and
of
the
high
destinies
reserved
for
the
young
colony
this
event
was
likely
to
be
a
favorite
theme
of
the
old
latin
minstrels
they
would
naturally
attribute
the
project
of
romulus
to
some
divine
intimation
of
the
power
and
prosperity
which
it
was
decreed
that
his
city
should
attain
they
would
probably
introduce
seers
foretelling
the
victories
of
unborn
consuls
and
dictators
and
the
last
great
victory
would
generally
occupy
the
most
conspicuous
place
in
the
prediction
there
is
nothing
strange
in
the
supposition
that
the
poet
who
was
employed
to
celebrate
the
first
great
triumph
of
the
romans
over
the
greeks
might
throw
his
song
of
exultation
into
this
form
the
occasion
was
one
likely
to
excite
the
strongest
feelings
of
national
pride
a
great
outrage
had
been
followed
by
a
great
retribution
seven
years
before
this
time
lucius
posthumius
megellus
who
sprang
from
one
of
the
noblest
houses
of
rome
and
had
been
thrice
consul
was
sent
ambassador
to
tarentum
with
charge
to
demand
reparation
for
grievous
injuries
the
tarentines
gave
him
audience
in
their
theatre
where
he
addressed
them
in
such
greek
as
he
could
command
which
we
may
well
believe
was
not
exactly
such
as
cineas
would
have
spoken
an
exquisite
sense
of
the
ridiculous
belonged
to
the
greek
character
and
closely
connected
with
this
faculty
was
a
strong
propensity
to
flippancy
and
impertinence
when
posthumius
placed
an
accent
wrong
his
hearers
burst
into
a
laugh
when
he
remonstrated
they
hooted
him
and
called
him
barbarian
and
at
length
hissed
him
off
the
stage
as
if
he
had
been
a
bad
actor
as
the
grave
roman
retired
a
buffoon
who
from
his
constant
drunkenness
was
nicknamed
the
came
up
with
gestures
of
the
grossest
indecency
and
bespattered
the
senatorial
gown
with
filth
posthumius
turned
round
to
the
multitude
and
held
up
the
gown
as
if
appealing
to
the
universal
law
of
nations
the
sight
only
increased
the
insolence
of
the
tarentines
they
clapped
their
hands
and
set
up
a
shout
of
laughter
which
shook
the
theatre
men
of
tarentum
said
posthumius
it
will
take
not
a
little
blood
to
wash
this
gown
rome
in
consequence
of
this
insult
declared
war
against
the
tarentines
the
tarentines
sought
for
allies
beyond
the
ionian
sea
phyrrhus
king
of
epirus
came
to
their
help
with
a
large
army
and
for
the
first
time
the
two
great
nations
of
antiquity
were
fairly
matched
against
each
other
the
fame
of
greece
in
arms
as
well
as
in
arts
was
then
at
the
height
half
a
century
earlier
the
career
of
alexander
had
excited
the
admiration
and
terror
of
all
nations
from
the
ganges
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
royal
houses
founded
by
macedonian
captains
still
reigned
at
antioch
and
alexandria
that
barbarian
warriors
led
by
barbarian
chiefs
should
win
a
pitched
battle
against
greek
valor
guided
by
greek
science
seemed
as
incredible
as
it
would
now
seem
that
the
burmese
or
the
siamese
should
in
the
open
plain
put
to
flight
an
equal
number
of
the
best
english
troops
the
tarentines
were
convinced
that
their
countrymen
were
irresistible
in
war
and
this
conviction
had
emboldened
them
to
treat
with
the
grossest
indignity
one
whom
they
regarded
as
the
representative
of
an
inferior
race
of
the
greek
generals
then
living
pyrrhus
was
indisputably
the
first
among
the
troops
who
were
trained
in
the
greek
discipline
his
epirotes
ranked
high
his
expedition
to
italy
was
a
in
the
history
of
the
world
he
found
there
a
people
who
far
inferior
to
the
athenians
and
corinthians
in
the
fine
arts
in
the
speculative
sciences
and
in
all
the
refinements
of
life
were
the
best
soldiers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
their
arms
their
gradations
of
rank
their
order
of
battle
their
method
of
intrenchment
were
all
of
latin
origin
and
had
all
been
gradually
brought
near
to
perfection
not
by
the
study
of
foreign
models
but
by
the
genius
and
experience
of
many
generations
of
great
native
commanders
the
first
words
which
broke
from
the
king
when
his
practised
eye
had
surveyed
the
roman
encampment
were
full
of
meaning
these
barbarians
he
said
have
nothing
barbarous
in
their
military
arrangements
he
was
at
first
victorious
for
his
own
talents
were
superior
to
those
of
the
captains
who
were
opposed
to
him
and
the
romans
were
not
prepared
for
the
onset
of
the
elephants
of
the
east
which
were
then
for
the
first
time
seen
in
italy
moving
mountains
with
long
snakes
for
hands
but
the
victories
of
the
epirotes
were
fiercely
disputed
dearly
purchased
and
altogether
unprofitable
at
length
manius
curius
dentatus
who
had
in
his
first
consulship
won
two
triumphs
was
again
placed
at
the
head
of
the
roman
commonwealth
and
sent
to
conquer
the
invaders
a
great
battle
was
fought
near
beneventum
pyrrhus
was
completely
defeated
he
repassed
the
sea
and
the
world
learned
with
amazement
that
a
people
had
been
discovered
who
in
fair
fighting
were
superior
to
the
best
troops
that
had
been
drilled
on
the
system
of
parmenio
and
antigonus
the
conquerors
had
a
good
right
to
exult
in
their
success
for
their
glory
was
all
their
own
they
had
not
learned
from
their
enemy
how
to
conquer
him
it
was
with
their
own
national
arms
and
in
their
own
national
battle
array
that
they
had
overcome
weapons
and
tactics
long
believed
to
be
invincible
the
pilum
and
the
broadsword
had
vanquished
the
macedonian
spear
the
legion
had
broken
the
macedonian
phalanx
even
the
elephants
when
the
surprise
produced
by
their
first
appearance
was
over
could
cause
no
disorder
in
the
steady
yet
flexible
battalions
of
rome
it
is
said
by
florus
and
may
easily
be
believed
that
the
triumph
far
surpassed
in
magnificence
any
that
rome
had
previously
seen
the
only
spoils
which
papirius
cursor
and
fabius
maximus
could
exhibit
were
flocks
and
herds
wagons
of
rude
structure
and
heaps
of
spears
and
helmets
but
now
for
the
first
time
the
riches
of
asia
and
the
arts
of
greece
adorned
a
roman
pageant
plate
fine
stuffs
costly
furniture
rare
animals
exquisite
paintings
and
sculptures
formed
part
of
the
procession
at
the
banquet
would
be
assembled
a
crowd
of
warriors
and
statesmen
among
whom
manius
curius
dentatus
would
take
the
highest
room
caius
fabricius
luscinus
then
after
two
consulships
and
two
triumphs
censor
of
the
commonwealth
would
doubtless
occupy
a
place
of
honor
at
the
board
in
situations
less
conspicuous
probably
lay
some
of
those
who
were
a
few
years
later
the
terror
of
carthage
caius
duilius
the
founder
of
the
maritime
greatness
of
his
country
marcus
atilius
regulus
who
owed
to
defeat
a
renown
far
higher
than
that
which
he
had
derived
from
his
victories
and
caius
lutatius
catalus
who
while
suffering
from
a
grievous
wound
fought
the
great
battle
of
the
æates
and
brought
the
first
punic
war
to
a
triumphant
close
it
is
impossible
to
recount
the
names
of
these
eminent
citizens
without
reflecting
that
they
were
without
exception
plebeians
and
would
but
for
the
ever
memorable
struggle
maintained
by
caius
licinius
and
lucius
sextius
have
been
doomed
to
hide
in
obscurity
or
to
waste
in
civil
broils
the
capacity
and
energy
which
prevailed
against
pyrrhus
and
hamilcar
on
such
a
day
we
may
suppose
that
the
patriotic
enthusiasm
of
a
latin
poet
would
vent
itself
in
reiterated
shouts
of
io
triumphe
such
as
were
uttered
by
horace
on
a
far
less
exciting
occasion
and
in
boasts
resembling
those
which
virgil
put
into
the
mouth
of
anchises
the
superiority
of
some
foreign
nations
and
especially
of
the
greeks
in
the
lazy
arts
of
peace
would
be
admitted
with
disdainful
candor
but
preëminence
in
all
the
qualities
which
fit
a
people
to
subdue
and
govern
mankind
would
be
claimed
for
the
romans
the
following
lay
belongs
to
the
latest
age
of
latin
nævis
and
livius
andronicus
were
probably
among
the
children
whose
mothers
held
them
up
to
see
the
chariot
of
curius
go
by
the
minstrel
who
sang
on
that
day
might
possibly
have
lived
to
read
the
first
hexameters
of
ennius
and
to
see
the
first
comedies
of
plautus
his
poem
as
might
be
expected
shows
a
much
wider
acquaintance
with
the
geography
manners
and
productions
of
remote
nations
than
would
have
been
found
in
compositions
of
the
age
of
camillus
but
he
troubles
himself
little
about
dates

heard

with
admiration

the
colossus
of
rhodes

of
the
structures

which

embellished
