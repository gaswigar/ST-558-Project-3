madame
here
is
the
work
which
you
asked
of
me
i
am
happy
in
thus
dedicating
it
to
offer
you
a
proof
of
the
respectful
affection
you
allow
me
to
bear
you
if
i
am
reproached
for
impotence
in
this
attempt
to
draw
from
the
depths
of
mysticism
a
book
which
seeks
to
give
in
the
lucid
transparency
of
our
beautiful
language
the
luminous
poesy
of
the
orient
to
you
the
blame
did
you
not
command
this
struggle
resembling
that
of
jacob
by
telling
me
that
the
most
imperfect
sketch
of
this
figure
dreamed
of
by
you
as
it
has
been
by
me
since
childhood
would
still
be
something
to
you
here
then
it
is
that
something
would
that
this
book
could
belong
exclusively
to
noble
spirits
preserved
like
yours
from
worldly
pettiness
by
solitude
they
would
know
how
to
give
to
it
the
melodious
rhythm
that
it
lacks
which
might
have
made
it
in
the
hands
of
a
poet
the
glorious
epic
that
france
still
awaits
but
from
me
they
must
accept
it
as
one
of
those
sculptured
balustrades
carved
by
a
hand
of
faith
on
which
the
pilgrims
lean
in
the
choir
of
some
glorious
church
to
think
upon
the
end
of
man
i
am
madame
with
respect

devoted

seraphita
chapter
seraphitus
as
the
eye
glances
over
a
map
of
the
coasts
of
norway
can
the
imagination
fail
to
marvel
at
their
fantastic
indentations
and
serrated
edges
like
a
granite
lace
against
which
the
surges
of
the
north
sea
roar
incessantly
who
has
not
dreamed
of
the
majestic
sights
to
be
seen
on
those
beachless
shores
of
that
multitude
of
creeks
and
inlets
and
little
bays
no
two
of
them
alike
yet
all
trackless
abysses
we
may
almost
fancy
that
nature
took
pleasure
in
recording
by
ineffaceable
hieroglyphics
the
symbol
of
norwegian
life
bestowing
on
these
coasts
the
conformation
of
a
fish
s
spine
fishery
being
the
staple
commerce
of
the
country
and
the
only
means
of
living
of
the
hardy
men
who
cling
like
tufts
of
lichen
to
the
arid
cliffs
here
through
fourteen
degrees
of
longitude
barely
seven
hundred
thousand
souls
maintain
existence
thanks
to
perils
devoid
of
glory
to
snows
which
clothe
the
norway
peaks
and
guard
them
from
profaning
foot
of
traveller
these
sublime
beauties
are
virgin
still
they
will
be
seen
to
harmonize
with
human
phenomena
also
virgin
at
least
to
poetry
which
here
took
place
the
history
of
which
it
is
our
purpose
to
relate
if
one
of
these
inlets
mere
fissures
to
the
eyes
of
the
is
wide
enough
for
the
sea
not
to
freeze
between
the
of
rock
against
which
it
surges
the
call
the
little
bay
a
fiord
a
word
which
geographers
of
every
nation
have
adopted
into
their
respective
languages
though
a
certain
resemblance
exists
among
all
these
fiords
each
has
its
own
characteristics
the
sea
has
everywhere
forced
its
way
as
through
a
breach
yet
the
rocks
about
each
fissure
are
diversely
rent
and
their
tumultuous
precipices
defy
the
rules
of
geometric
law
here
the
scarp
is
dentelled
like
a
saw
there
the
narrow
ledges
barely
allow
the
snow
to
lodge
or
the
noble
crests
of
the
northern
pines
to
spread
themselves
farther
on
some
convulsion
of
nature
may
have
rounded
a
coquettish
curve
into
a
lovely
valley
flanked
in
rising
terraces
with
pines
truly
we
are
tempted
to
call
this
land
the
switzerland
of
ocean
midway
between
trondhjem
and
christiansand
lies
an
inlet
called
the
if
the
is
not
the
loveliest
of
these
rocky
landscapes
it
has
the
merit
of
displaying
the
terrestrial
grandeurs
of
norway
and
of
enshrining
the
scenes
of
a
history
that
is
indeed
celestial
the
general
outline
of
the
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
that
of
a
funnel
washed
out
by
the
sea
the
passage
which
the
waves
have
forced
present
to
the
eye
an
image
of
the
eternal
struggle
between
old
ocean
and
the
granite
rock
two
creations
of
equal
power
one
through
inertia
the
other
by
ceaseless
motion
reefs
of
fantastic
shape
run
out
on
either
side
and
bar
the
way
of
ships
and
forbid
their
entrance
the
intrepid
sons
of
norway
cross
these
reefs
on
foot
springing
from
rock
to
rock
undismayed
at
the
abyss
a
hundred
fathoms
deep
and
only
six
feet
wide
which
yawns
beneath
them
here
a
tottering
block
of
gneiss
falling
athwart
two
rocks
gives
an
uncertain
footway
there
the
hunters
or
the
fishermen
carrying
their
loads
have
flung
the
stems
of
in
guise
of
bridges
to
join
the
projecting
reefs
around
and
beneath
which
the
surges
roar
incessantly
this
dangerous
entrance
to
the
little
bay
bears
obliquely
to
the
right
with
a
serpentine
movement
and
there
encounters
a
mountain
rising
some
hundred
feet
above
the
base
of
which
is
a
vertical
palisade
of
solid
rock
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
long
the
inflexible
granite
nowhere
yielding
to
clefts
or
undulations
until
it
reaches
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
above
the
water
rushing
violently
in
the
sea
is
driven
back
with
equal
violence
by
the
inert
force
of
the
mountain
to
the
opposite
shore
gently
curved
by
the
spent
force
of
the
retreating
waves
the
fiord
is
closed
at
the
upper
end
by
a
vast
gneiss
formation
crowned
with
forests
down
which
a
river
plunges
in
cascades
becomes
a
torrent
when
the
snows
are
melting
spreads
into
a
sheet
of
waters
and
then
falls
with
a
roar
into
the
bay
vomiting
as
it
does
so
the
hoary
pines
and
the
aged
larches
washed
down
from
the
forests
and
scarce
seen
amid
the
foam
these
trees
plunge
headlong
into
the
fiord
and
reappear
after
a
time
on
the
surface
clinging
together
and
forming
islets
which
float
ashore
on
the
beaches
where
the
inhabitants
of
a
village
on
the
left
bank
of
the
gather
them
up
split
broken
though
sometimes
whole
and
always
stripped
of
bark
and
branches
the
mountain
which
receives
at
its
base
the
assaults
of
ocean
and
at
its
summit
the
buffeting
of
the
wild
north
wind
is
called
the
falberg
its
crest
wrapped
at
all
seasons
in
a
mantle
of
snow
and
ice
is
the
sharpest
peak
of
norway
its
proximity
to
the
pole
produces
at
the
height
of
eighteen
hundred
feet
a
degree
of
cold
equal
to
that
of
the
highest
mountains
of
the
globe
the
summit
of
this
rocky
mass
rising
sheer
from
the
fiord
on
one
side
slopes
gradually
downward
to
the
east
where
it
joins
the
declivities
of
the
sieg
and
forms
a
series
of
terraced
valleys
the
chilly
temperature
of
which
allows
no
growth
but
that
of
shrubs
and
stunted
trees
the
upper
end
of
the
fiord
where
the
waters
enter
it
as
they
come
down
from
the
forest
is
called
the
siegdahlen
a
word
which
may
be
held
to
mean
the
shedding
of
the
sieg
the
river
itself
receiving
that
name
the
curving
shore
opposite
to
the
face
of
the
falberg
is
the
valley
of
jarvis
a
smiling
scene
overlooked
by
hills
clothed
with
firs
and
larches
mingled
with
a
few
oaks
and
beeches
the
richest
coloring
of
all
the
varied
tapestries
which
nature
in
these
northern
regions
spreads
upon
the
surface
of
her
rugged
rocks
the
eye
can
readily
mark
the
line
where
the
soil
warmed
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
bears
cultivation
and
shows
the
native
growth
of
the
norwegian
flora
here
the
expanse
of
the
fiord
is
broad
enough
to
allow
the
sea
dashed
back
by
the
falberg
to
spend
its
expiring
force
in
gentle
murmurs
upon
the
lower
slope
of
these
hills
a
shore
bordered
with
finest
sand
strewn
with
mica
and
sparkling
pebbles
porphyry
and
marbles
of
a
thousand
tints
brought
from
sweden
by
the
river
floods
together
with
ocean
waifs
shells
and
flowers
of
the
sea
driven
in
by
tempests
whether
of
the
pole
or
tropics
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
of
jarvis
lies
a
village
of
some
two
hundred
wooden
houses
where
an
isolated
population
lives
like
a
swarm
of
bees
in
a
forest
without
increasing
or
diminishing
vegetating
happily
while
wringing
their
means
of
living
from
the
breast
of
a
stern
nature
the
almost
unknown
existence
of
the
little
hamlet
is
readily
accounted
for
few
of
its
inhabitants
were
bold
enough
to
risk
their
lives
among
the
reefs
to
reach
the
fishing
the
staple
industry
of
norwegians
on
the
least
dangerous
portions
of
their
coast
the
fish
of
the
fiord
were
numerous
enough
to
suffice
in
part
at
least
for
the
sustenance
of
the
inhabitants
the
valley
pastures
provided
milk
and
butter
a
certain
amount
of
fruitful
soil
yielded
rye
and
hemp
and
vegetables
which
necessity
taught
the
people
to
protect
against
the
severity
of
the
cold
and
the
fleeting
but
terrible
heat
of
the
sun
with
the
shrewd
ability
which
norwegians
display
in
the
struggle
the
difficulty
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
either
by
land
where
the
roads
are
impassable
or
by
sea
where
none
but
tiny
boats
can
thread
their
way
through
the
maritime
defiles
that
guard
the
entrance
to
the
bay
hinder
these
people
from
growing
rich
by
the
sale
of
their
timber
it
would
cost
enormous
sums
to
either
blast
a
channel
out
to
sea
or
construct
a
way
to
the
interior
the
roads
from
christiana
to
trondhjem
all
turn
toward
the
and
cross
the
sieg
by
a
bridge
some
score
of
miles
above
its
fall
into
the
bay
the
country
to
the
north
between
jarvis
and
trondhjem
is
covered
with
impenetrable
forests
while
to
the
south
the
falberg
is
nearly
as
much
separated
from
christiana
by
inaccessible
precipices
the
village
of
jarvis
might
perhaps
have
communicated
with
the
interior
of
norway
and
sweden
by
the
river
sieg
but
to
do
this
and
to
be
thus
brought
into
contact
with
civilization
the
needed
the
presence
of
a
man
of
genius
such
a
man
did
actually
appear
there
a
poet
a
swede
of
great
religious
fervor
who
died
admiring
even
reverencing
this
region
as
one
of
the
noblest
works
of
the
creator
minds
endowed
by
study
with
an
inward
sight
and
whose
quick
perceptions
bring
before
the
soul
as
though
painted
on
a
canvas
the
contrasting
scenery
of
this
universe
will
now
apprehend
the
general
features
of
the
they
alone
perhaps
can
thread
their
way
through
the
tortuous
channels
of
the
reef
or
flee
with
the
battling
waves
to
the
everlasting
rebuff
of
the
falberg
whose
white
peaks
mingle
with
the
vaporous
clouds
of
the
sky
or
watch
with
delight
the
curving
sheet
of
waters
or
hear
the
rushing
of
the
sieg
as
it
hangs
for
an
instant
in
long
fillets
and
then
falls
over
a
picturesque
abatis
of
noble
trees
toppled
confusedly
together
sometimes
upright
sometimes
beneath
the
rocks
it
may
be
that
such
minds
alone
can
dwell
upon
the
smiling
scenes
nestling
among
the
lower
hills
of
jarvis
where
the
luscious
northern
vegetables
spring
up
in
families
in
myriads
where
the
white
birches
bend
graceful
as
maidens
where
colonnades
of
beeches
rear
their
boles
mossy
with
the
growth
of
centuries
where
shades
of
green
contrast
and
white
clouds
float
amid
the
blackness
of
the
distant
pines
and
tracts
of
crimson
and
purple
shrubs
are
shaded
endlessly
in
short
where
blend
all
colors
all
perfumes
of
a
flora
whose
wonders
are
still
ignored
widen
the
boundaries
of
this
limited
ampitheatre
spring
upward
to
the
clouds
lose
yourself
among
the
rocks
where
the
seals
are
lying
and
even
then
your
thought
can
not
compass
the
wealth
of
beauty
nor
the
poetry
of
this
norwegian
coast
can
your
thought
be
as
vast
as
the
ocean
that
bounds
it
as
weird
as
the
fantastic
forms
drawn
by
these
forests
these
clouds
these
shadows
these
changeful
lights
do
you
see
above
the
meadows
on
that
lowest
slope
which
undulates
around
the
higher
hills
of
jarvis
two
or
three
hundred
houses
roofed
with
noever
a
sort
of
thatch
made
of
frail
houses
long
and
low
looking
like
on
a
tossed
hither
by
the
winds
above
these
humble
peaceful
dwellings
stands
the
church
built
with
a
simplicity
in
keeping
with
the
poverty
of
the
villagers
a
graveyard
surrounds
the
chancel
and
a
little
farther
on
you
see
the
parsonage
higher
up
on
a
projection
of
the
mountain
is
a
the
only
one
of
stone
for
which
reason
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
call
it
the
swedish
in
fact
a
wealthy
swede
settled
in
jarvis
about
thirty
years
before
this
history
begins
and
did
his
best
to
ameliorate
its
condition
this
little
house
certainly
not
a
castle
built
with
the
intention
of
leading
the
inhabitants
to
build
others
like
it
was
noticeable
for
its
solidity
and
for
the
wall
that
inclosed
it
a
rare
thing
in
norway
where
notwithstanding
the
abundance
of
stone
wood
alone
is
used
for
all
fences
even
those
of
fields
this
swedish
house
thus
protected
against
the
climate
stood
on
rising
ground
in
the
centre
of
an
immense
courtyard
the
windows
were
sheltered
by
those
projecting
roofs
supported
by
squared
trunks
of
trees
which
give
so
patriarchal
an
air
to
northern
dwellings
from
beneath
them
the
eye
could
see
the
savage
nudity
of
the
falberg
or
compare
the
infinitude
of
the
open
sea
with
the
tiny
drop
of
water
in
the
foaming
fiord
the
ear
could
hear
the
flowing
of
the
sieg
whose
white
sheet
far
away
looked
motionless
as
it
fell
into
its
granite
cup
edged
for
miles
around
with
glaciers
in
short
from
this
vantage
ground
the
whole
landscape
whereon
our
simple
yet
superhuman
drama
was
about
to
be
enacted
could
be
seen
and
noted
the
winter
of
was
one
of
the
most
severe
ever
known
to
europeans
the
norwegian
sea
was
frozen
in
all
the
fiords
where
as
a
usual
thing
the
violence
of
the
surf
kept
the
ice
from
forming
a
wind
whose
effects
were
like
those
of
the
spanish
levanter
swept
the
ice
of
the
driving
the
snow
to
the
upper
end
of
the
gulf
seldom
indeed
could
the
people
of
jarvis
see
the
mirror
of
frozen
waters
reflecting
the
colors
of
the
sky
a
wondrous
site
in
the
bosom
of
these
mountains
when
all
other
aspects
of
nature
are
levelled
beneath
successive
sheets
of
snow
and
crests
and
valleys
are
alike
mere
folds
of
the
vast
mantle
flung
by
winter
across
a
landscape
at
once
so
mournfully
dazzling
and
so
monotonous
the
falling
volume
of
the
sieg
suddenly
frozen
formed
an
immense
arcade
beneath
which
the
inhabitants
might
have
crossed
under
shelter
from
the
blast
had
any
dared
to
risk
themselves
inland
but
the
dangers
of
every
step
away
from
their
own
surroundings
kept
even
the
boldest
hunters
in
their
homes
afraid
lest
the
narrow
paths
along
the
precipices
the
clefts
and
fissures
among
the
rocks
might
be
unrecognizable
beneath
the
snow
thus
it
was
that
no
human
creature
gave
life
to
the
white
desert
where
boreas
reigned
his
voice
alone
resounding
at
distant
intervals
the
sky
nearly
always
gray
gave
tones
of
polished
steel
to
the
ice
of
the
fiord
perchance
some
ancient
crossed
the
expanse
trusting
to
the
warm
down
beneath
which
dream
in
other
lands
the
luxurious
rich
little
knowing
of
the
dangers
through
which
their
luxury
has
come
to
them
like
the
bedouin
of
the
desert
who
darts
alone
across
the
sands
of
africa
the
bird
is
neither
seen
nor
heard
the
torpid
atmosphere
deprived
of
its
electrical
conditions
echoes
neither
the
whirr
of
its
wings
nor
its
joyous
notes
besides
what
human
eye
was
strong
enough
to
bear
the
glitter
of
those
pinnacles
adorned
with
sparkling
crystals
or
the
sharp
reflections
of
the
snow
iridescent
on
the
summits
in
the
rays
of
a
pallid
sun
which
infrequently
appeared
like
a
dying
man
seeking
to
make
known
that
he
still
lives
often
when
the
flocks
of
gray
clouds
driven
in
squadrons
athwart
the
mountains
and
among
the
hid
the
sky
with
their
triple
veils
earth
lacking
the
celestial
lights
lit
herself
by
herself
here
then
we
meet
the
majesty
of
cold
seated
eternally
at
the
pole
in
that
regal
silence
which
is
the
attribute
of
all
absolute
monarchy
every
extreme
principle
carries
with
it
an
appearance
of
negation
and
the
symptoms
of
death
for
is
not
life
the
struggle
of
two
forces
here
in
this
northern
nature
nothing
lived
one
sole
power
the
unproductive
power
of
ice
reigned
unchallenged
the
roar
of
the
open
sea
no
longer
reached
the
deaf
dumb
inlet
where
during
one
short
season
of
the
year
nature
made
haste
to
produce
the
slender
harvests
necessary
for
the
food
of
the
patient
people
a
few
tall
lifted
their
black
pyramids
garlanded
with
snow
and
the
form
of
their
long
branches
and
depending
shoots
completed
the
mourning
garments
of
those
solemn
heights
each
household
gathered
in
its
in
houses
carefully
closed
from
the
outer
air
and
well
supplied
with
biscuit
melted
butter
dried
fish
and
other
provisions
laid
in
for
the
winter
the
very
smoke
of
these
dwellings
was
hardly
seen
as
they
were
beneath
the
snow
against
the
weight
of
which
they
were
protected
by
long
planks
reaching
from
the
roof
and
fastened
at
some
distance
to
solid
blocks
on
the
ground
forming
a
covered
way
around
each
building
during
these
terrible
winter
months
the
women
spun
and
dyed
the
woollen
stuffs
and
the
linen
fabrics
with
which
they
clothed
their
families
while
the
men
read
or
fell
into
those
endless
meditations
which
have
given
birth
to
so
many
profound
theories
to
the
mystic
dreams
of
the
north
to
its
beliefs
to
its
studies
so
full
and
so
complete
in
one
science
at
least
sounded
as
with
a
plummet
to
its
manners
and
its
morals
which
force
the
soul
to
react
and
feed
upon
itself
and
make
the
norwegian
peasant
a
being
apart
among
the
peoples
of
europe
such
was
the
condition
of
the
in
the
first
year
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
may
on
a
morning
when
the
sun
burst
forth
upon
this
landscape
lighting
the
fires
of
the
ephemeral
diamonds
produced
by
crystallizations
of
the
snow
and
ice
two
beings
crossed
the
fiord
and
flew
along
the
base
of
the
falberg
rising
thence
from
ledge
to
ledge
toward
the
summit
what
were
they
human
creatures
or
two
arrows
they
might
have
been
taken
for
sailing
in
consort
before
the
wind
not
the
boldest
hunter
nor
the
most
superstitious
fisherman
would
have
attributed
to
human
beings
the
power
to
move
safely
along
the
slender
lines
traced
beneath
the
snow
by
the
granite
ledges
where
yet
this
couple
glided
with
the
terrifying
dexterity
of
somnambulists
who
forgetting
their
own
weight
and
the
dangers
of
the
slightest
deviation
hurry
along
a
and
keep
their
equilibrium
by
the
power
of
some
mysterious
force
stop
me
seraphitus
said
a
pale
young
girl
and
let
me
breathe
i
look
at
you
you
only
while
scaling
these
walls
of
the
gulf
otherwise
what
would
become
of
me
i
am
such
a
feeble
creature
do
i
tire
you
no
said
the
being
on
whose
arm
she
leaned
but
let
us
go
on
minna
the
place
where
we
are
is
not
firm
enough
to
stand
once
more
the
snow
creaked
sharply
beneath
the
long
boards
fastened
to
their
feet
and
soon
they
reached
the
upper
terrace
of
the
first
ledge
clearly
defined
upon
the
flank
of
the
precipice
the
person
whom
minna
had
addressed
as
seraphitus
threw
his
weight
upon
his
right
heel
arresting
the
plank
six
and
a
half
feet
long
and
narrow
as
the
foot
of
a
child
which
was
fastened
to
his
boot
by
a
double
thong
of
leather
this
plank
two
inches
thick
was
covered
with
reindeer
skin
which
bristled
against
the
snow
when
the
foot
was
raised
and
served
to
stop
the
wearer
seraphitus
drew
in
his
left
foot
furnished
with
another
skee
which
was
only
two
feet
long
turned
swiftly
where
he
stood
caught
his
timid
companion
in
his
arms
lifted
her
in
spite
of
the
long
boards
on
her
feet
and
placed
her
on
a
projecting
rock
from
which
he
brushed
the
snow
with
his
pelisse
you
are
safe
there
minna
you
can
tremble
at
your
we
are
a
third
of
the
way
up
the
she
said
looking
at
the
peak
to
which
she
gave
the
popular
name
by
which
it
is
known
in
norway
i
can
hardly
believe
too
much
out
of
breath
to
say
more
she
smiled
at
seraphitus
who
without
answering
laid
his
hand
upon
her
heart
and
listened
to
its
sounding
throbs
rapid
as
those
of
a
frightened
bird
it
often
beats
as
fast
when
i
run
she
said
seraphitus
inclined
his
head
with
a
gesture
that
was
neither
coldness
nor
indifference
and
yet
despite
the
grace
which
made
the
movement
almost
tender
it
none
the
less
bespoke
a
certain
negation
which
in
a
woman
would
have
seemed
an
exquisite
coquetry
seraphitus
clasped
the
young
girl
in
his
arms
minna
accepted
the
caress
as
an
answer
to
her
words
continuing
to
gaze
at
him
as
he
raised
his
head
and
threw
back
with
impatient
gesture
the
golden
masses
of
his
hair
to
free
his
brow
he
saw
an
expression
of
joy
in
the
eyes
of
his
companion
yes
minna
he
said
in
a
voice
whose
paternal
accents
were
charming
from
the
lips
of
a
being
who
was
still
adolescent
keep
your
eyes
on
me
do
not
look
below
why
not
she
asked
you
wish
to
know
why
then
look
minna
glanced
quickly
at
her
feet
and
cried
out
suddenly
like
a
child
who
sees
a
tiger
the
awful
sensation
of
abysses
seized
her
one
glance
sufficed
to
communicate
its
contagion
the
fiord
eager
for
food
bewildered
her
with
its
loud
voice
ringing
in
her
ears
interposing
between
herself
and
life
as
though
to
devour
her
more
surely
from
the
crown
of
her
head
to
her
feet
and
along
her
spine
an
icy
shudder
ran
then
suddenly
intolerable
heat
suffused
her
nerves
beat
in
her
veins
and
overpowered
her
extremities
with
electric
shocks
like
those
of
the
torpedo
too
feeble
to
resist
she
felt
herself
drawn
by
a
mysterious
power
to
the
depths
below
wherein
she
fancied
that
she
saw
some
monster
belching
its
venom
a
monster
whose
magnetic
eyes
were
charming
her
whose
open
jaws
appeared
to
craunch
their
prey
before
they
seized
it
i
die
my
seraphitus
loving
none
but
thee
she
said
making
a
mechanical
movement
to
fling
herself
into
the
abyss
seraphitus
breathed
softly
on
her
forehead
and
eyes
suddenly
like
a
traveller
relaxed
after
a
bath
minna
forgot
these
keen
emotions
already
dissipated
by
that
caressing
breath
which
penetrated
her
body
and
filled
it
with
balsamic
essences
as
quickly
as
the
breath
itself
had
crossed
the
air
who
art
thou
she
said
with
a
feeling
of
gentle
terror
ah
but
i
know
thou
art
my
life
how
canst
thou
look
into
that
gulf
and
not
die
she
added
presently
seraphitus
left
her
clinging
to
the
granite
rock
and
placed
himself
at
the
edge
of
the
narrow
platform
on
which
they
stood
whence
his
eyes
plunged
to
the
depths
of
the
fiord
defying
its
dazzling
invitation
his
body
did
not
tremble
his
brow
was
white
and
calm
as
that
of
a
marble
statue
an
abyss
facing
an
abyss
seraphitus
dost
thou
not
love
me
come
back
she
cried
thy
danger
renews
my
terror
who
art
thou
to
have
such
superhuman
power
at
thy
age
she
asked
as
she
felt
his
arms
inclosing
her
once
more
but
minna
answered
seraphitus
you
look
fearlessly
at
greater
spaces
far
than
then
with
raised
finger
this
strange
being
pointed
upward
to
the
blue
dome
which
parting
clouds
left
clear
above
their
heads
where
stars
could
be
seen
in
open
day
by
virtue
of
atmospheric
laws
as
yet
unstudied
but
what
a
difference
she
answered
smiling
you
are
right
he
said
we
are
born
to
stretch
upward
to
the
skies
our
native
land
like
the
face
of
a
mother
can
not
terrify
her
his
voice
vibrated
through
the
being
of
his
companion
who
made
no
reply
come
let
us
go
on
he
said
the
pair
darted
forward
along
the
narrow
paths
traced
back
and
forth
upon
the
mountain
skimming
from
terrace
to
terrace
from
line
to
line
with
the
rapidity
of
a
barb
that
bird
of
the
desert
presently
they
reached
an
open
space
carpeted
with
turf
and
moss
and
flowers
where
no
foot
had
ever
trod
oh
the
pretty
saeter
cried
minna
giving
to
the
upland
meadow
its
norwegian
name
but
how
comes
it
here
at
such
a
height
vegetation
ceases
here
it
is
true
said
seraphitus
these
few
plants
and
flowers
are
due
to
that
sheltering
rock
which
protects
the
meadow
from
the
polar
winds
put
that
tuft
in
your
bosom
minna
he
added
gathering
a
flower
that
balmy
creation
which
no
eye
has
ever
seen
keep
the
solitary
matchless
flower
in
memory
of
this
one
matchless
morning
of
your
life
you
will
find
no
other
guide
to
lead
you
again
to
this
so
saying
he
gave
her
the
hybrid
plant
his
falcon
eye
had
seen
amid
the
tufts
of
gentian
acaulis
and
saxifrages
a
marvel
brought
to
bloom
by
the
breath
of
angels
with
girlish
eagerness
minna
seized
the
tufted
plant
of
transparent
green
vivid
as
emerald
which
was
formed
of
little
leaves
rolled
brown
at
the
smaller
end
but
changing
tint
by
tint
to
their
delicately
notched
edges
which
were
green
these
leaves
were
so
tightly
pressed
together
that
they
seemed
to
blend
and
form
a
mat
or
cluster
of
rosettes
here
and
there
from
this
green
ground
rose
pure
white
stars
edged
with
a
line
of
gold
and
from
their
throats
came
crimson
anthers
but
no
pistils
a
fragrance
blended
of
roses
and
of
orange
blossoms
yet
ethereal
and
fugitive
gave
something
as
it
were
celestial
to
that
mysterious
flower
which
seraphitus
sadly
contemplated
as
though
it
uttered
plaintive
thoughts
which
he
alone
could
understand
but
to
minna
this
mysterious
phenomenon
seemed
a
mere
caprice
of
nature
giving
to
stone
the
freshness
softness
and
perfume
of
plants
why
do
you
call
it
matchless
can
it
not
reproduce
itself
she
asked
looking
at
seraphitus
who
colored
and
turned
away
let
us
sit
down
he
said
presently
look
below
you
minna
see
at
this
height
you
will
have
no
fear
the
abyss
is
so
far
beneath
us
that
we
no
longer
have
a
sense
of
its
depths
it
acquires
the
perspective
uniformity
of
ocean
the
vagueness
of
clouds
the
soft
coloring
of
the
sky
see
the
ice
of
the
fiord
is
a
turquoise
the
dark
pine
forests
are
mere
threads
of
brown
for
us
all
abysses
should
be
thus
seraphitus
said
the
words
with
that
fervor
of
tone
and
gesture
seen
and
known
only
by
those
who
have
ascended
the
highest
mountains
of
the
globe
a
fervor
so
involuntarily
acquired
that
the
haughtiest
of
men
is
forced
to
regard
his
guide
as
a
brother
forgetting
his
own
superior
station
till
he
descends
to
the
valleys
and
the
abodes
of
his
kind
seraphitus
unfastened
the
skees
from
minna
s
feet
kneeling
before
her
the
girl
did
not
notice
him
so
absorbed
was
she
in
the
marvellous
view
now
offered
of
her
native
land
whose
rocky
outlines
could
here
be
seen
at
a
glance
she
felt
with
deep
emotion
the
solemn
permanence
of
those
frozen
summits
to
which
words
could
give
no
adequate
utterance
we
have
not
come
here
by
human
power
alone
she
said
clasping
her
hands
but
perhaps
i
you
think
that
facts
the
causes
of
which
you
can
not
perceive
are
supernatural
replied
her
companion
your
replies
she
said
always
bear
the
stamp
of
some
deep
thought
when
i
am
near
you
i
understand
all
things
without
an
effort
ah
i
am
free
if
so
you
will
not
need
your
skees
he
answered
oh
she
said
i
who
would
fain
unfasten
yours
and
kiss
your
feet
keep
such
words
for
wilfrid
said
seraphitus
gently
wilfrid
cried
minna
angrily
then
softening
as
she
glanced
at
her
companion
s
face
and
trying
but
in
vain
to
take
his
hand
she
added
you
are
never
angry
never
you
are
so
hopelessly
perfect
in
all
from
which
you
conclude
that
i
am
minna
was
startled
at
this
lucid
interpretation
of
her
thought
you
prove
to
me
at
any
rate
that
we
understand
each
other
she
said
with
the
grace
of
a
loving
woman
seraphitus
softly
shook
his
head
and
looked
sadly
and
gently
at
her
you
who
know
all
things
said
minna
tell
me
why
it
is
that
the
timidity
i
felt
below
is
over
now
that
i
have
mounted
higher
why
do
i
dare
to
look
at
you
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
while
lower
down
i
scarcely
dared
to
give
a
furtive
glance
perhaps
because
we
are
withdrawn
from
the
pettiness
of
earth
he
answered
unfastening
his
pelisse
never
never
have
i
seen
you
so
beautiful
cried
minna
sitting
down
on
a
mossy
rock
and
losing
herself
in
contemplation
of
the
being
who
had
now
guided
her
to
a
part
of
the
peak
hitherto
supposed
to
be
inaccessible
never
in
truth
had
seraphitus
shone
with
so
bright
a
radiance
the
only
word
which
can
render
the
illumination
of
his
face
and
the
aspect
of
his
whole
person
was
this
splendor
due
to
the
lustre
which
the
pure
air
of
mountains
and
the
reflections
of
the
snow
give
to
the
complexion
was
it
produced
by
the
inward
impulse
which
excites
the
body
at
the
instant
when
exertion
is
arrested
did
it
come
from
the
sudden
contrast
between
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
the
darkness
of
the
clouds
from
whose
shadow
the
charming
couple
had
just
emerged
perhaps
to
all
these
causes
we
may
add
the
effect
of
a
phenomenon
one
of
the
noblest
which
human
nature
has
to
offer
if
some
able
physiologist
had
studied
this
being
who
judging
by
the
pride
on
his
brow
and
the
lightning
in
his
eyes
seemed
a
youth
of
about
seventeen
years
of
age
and
if
the
student
had
sought
for
the
springs
of
that
beaming
life
beneath
the
whitest
skin
that
ever
the
north
bestowed
upon
her
offspring
he
would
undoubtedly
have
believed
either
in
some
phosphoric
fluid
of
the
nerves
shining
beneath
the
cuticle
or
in
the
constant
presence
of
an
inward
luminary
whose
rays
issued
through
the
being
of
seraphitus
like
a
light
through
an
alabaster
vase
soft
and
slender
as
were
his
hands
ungloved
to
remove
his
companion
s
they
seemed
possessed
of
a
strength
equal
to
that
which
the
creator
gave
to
the
diaphanous
tentacles
of
the
crab
the
fire
darting
from
his
vivid
glance
seemed
to
struggle
with
the
beams
of
the
sun
not
to
take
but
to
give
them
light
his
body
slim
and
delicate
as
that
of
a
woman
gave
evidence
of
one
of
those
natures
which
are
feeble
apparently
but
whose
strength
equals
their
will
rendering
them
at
times
powerful
of
medium
height
seraphitus
appeared
to
grow
in
stature
as
he
turned
fully
round
and
seemed
about
to
spring
upward
his
hair
curled
by
a
fairy
s
hand
and
waving
to
the
breeze
increased
the
illusion
produced
by
this
aerial
attitude
yet
his
bearing
wholly
without
conscious
effort
was
the
result
far
more
of
a
moral
phenomenon
than
of
a
corporal
habit
minna
s
imagination
seconded
this
illusion
under
the
dominion
of
which
all
persons
would
assuredly
have
fallen
an
illusion
which
gave
to
seraphitus
the
appearance
of
a
vision
dreamed
of
in
happy
sleep
no
known
type
conveys
an
image
of
that
form
so
majestically
made
to
minna
but
which
to
the
eyes
of
a
man
would
have
eclipsed
in
womanly
grace
the
fairest
of
raphael
s
creations
that
painter
of
heaven
has
ever
put
a
tranquil
joy
a
loving
sweetness
into
the
lines
of
his
angelic
conceptions
but
what
soul
unless
it
contemplated
seraphitus
himself
could
have
conceived
the
ineffable
emotions
imprinted
on
his
face
who
would
have
divined
even
in
the
dreams
of
artists
where
all
things
become
possible
the
shadow
cast
by
some
mysterious
awe
upon
that
brow
shining
with
intellect
which
seemed
to
question
heaven
and
to
pity
earth
the
head
hovered
awhile
disdainfully
as
some
majestic
bird
whose
cries
reverberate
on
the
atmosphere
then
bowed
itself
resignedly
like
the
turtledove
uttering
soft
notes
of
tenderness
in
the
depths
of
the
silent
woods
his
complexion
was
of
marvellous
whiteness
which
brought
out
vividly
the
coral
lips
the
brown
eyebrows
and
the
silken
lashes
the
only
colors
that
trenched
upon
the
paleness
of
that
face
whose
perfect
regularity
did
not
detract
from
the
grandeur
of
the
sentiments
expressed
in
it
nay
thought
and
emotion
were
reflected
there
without
hindrance
or
violence
with
the
majestic
and
natural
gravity
which
we
delight
in
attributing
to
superior
beings
that
face
of
purest
marble
expressed
in
all
things
strength
and
peace
minna
rose
to
take
the
hand
of
seraphitus
hoping
thus
to
draw
him
to
her
and
to
lay
on
that
seductive
brow
a
kiss
given
more
from
admiration
than
from
love
but
a
glance
at
the
young
man
s
eyes
which
pierced
her
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
penetrates
a
prism
paralyzed
the
young
girl
she
felt
but
without
comprehending
a
gulf
between
them
then
she
turned
away
her
head
and
wept
suddenly
a
strong
hand
seized
her
by
the
waist
and
a
soft
voice
said
to
her
come
she
obeyed
resting
her
head
suddenly
revived
upon
the
heart
of
her
companion
who
regulating
his
step
to
hers
with
gentle
and
attentive
conformity
led
her
to
a
spot
whence
they
could
see
the
radiant
glories
of
the
polar
nature
before
i
look
before
i
listen
to
you
tell
me
seraphitus
why
you
repulse
me
have
i
displeased
you
and
how
tell
me
i
want
nothing
for
myself
i
would
that
all
my
earthly
goods
were
yours
for
the
riches
of
my
heart
are
yours
already
i
would
that
light
came
to
my
eyes
only
though
your
eyes
just
as
my
thought
is
born
of
your
thought
i
should
not
then
fear
to
offend
you
for
i
should
give
you
back
the
echoes
of
your
soul
the
words
of
your
heart
day
by
day
as
we
render
to
god
the
meditations
with
which
his
spirit
nourishes
our
minds
i
would
be
thine
minna
a
constant
desire
is
that
which
shapes
our
future
hope
on
but
if
you
would
be
pure
in
heart
mingle
the
idea
of
the
with
your
affections
here
below
then
you
will
love
all
creatures
and
your
heart
will
rise
to
heights
i
will
do
all
you
tell
me
she
answered
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
timid
movement
i
can
not
be
your
companion
said
seraphitus
sadly
he
seemed
to
repress
some
thoughts
then
stretched
his
arms
towards
christiana
just
visible
like
a
speck
on
the
horizon
and
said
look
we
are
very
small
she
said
yes
but
we
become
great
through
feeling
and
through
intellect
answered
seraphitus
with
us
and
us
alone
minna
begins
the
knowledge
of
things
the
little
that
we
learn
of
the
laws
of
the
visible
world
enables
us
to
apprehend
the
immensity
of
the
worlds
invisible
i
know
not
if
the
time
has
come
to
speak
thus
to
you
but
i
would
ah
i
would
communicate
to
you
the
flame
of
my
hopes
perhaps
we
may
one
day
be
together
in
the
world
where
love
never
why
not
here
and
now
she
said
murmuring
nothing
is
stable
here
he
said
disdainfully
the
passing
joys
of
earthly
love
are
gleams
which
reveal
to
certain
souls
the
coming
of
joys
more
durable
just
as
the
discovery
of
a
single
law
of
nature
leads
certain
privileged
beings
to
a
conception
of
the
system
of
the
universe
our
fleeting
happiness
here
below
is
the
forerunning
proof
of
another
and
a
perfect
happiness
just
as
the
earth
a
fragment
of
the
world
attests
the
universe
we
can
not
measure
the
vast
orbit
of
the
divine
thought
of
which
we
are
but
an
atom
as
small
as
god
is
great
but
we
can
feel
its
vastness
we
can
kneel
adore
and
wait
men
ever
mislead
themselves
in
science
by
not
perceiving
that
all
things
on
their
globe
are
related
and
to
the
general
evolution
to
a
constant
movement
and
production
which
bring
with
them
necessarily
both
advancement
and
an
end
man
himself
is
not
a
finished
creation
if
he
were
god
would
not
how
is
it
that
in
thy
short
life
thou
hast
found
the
time
to
learn
so
many
things
said
the
young
girl
i
remember
he
replied
thou
art
nobler
than
all
else
i
we
are
the
noblest
of
god
s
greatest
works
has
he
not
given
us
the
faculty
of
reflecting
on
nature
of
gathering
it
within
us
by
thought
of
making
it
a
footstool
and
from
and
by
which
to
rise
to
him
we
love
according
to
the
greater
or
the
lesser
portion
of
heaven
our
souls
contain
but
do
not
be
unjust
minna
behold
the
magnificence
spread
before
you
ocean
expands
at
your
feet
like
a
carpet
the
mountains
resemble
ampitheatres
heaven
s
ether
is
above
them
like
the
arching
folds
of
a
stage
curtain
here
we
may
breathe
the
thoughts
of
god
as
it
were
like
a
perfume
see
the
angry
billows
which
engulf
the
ships
laden
with
men
seem
to
us
where
we
are
mere
bubbles
and
if
we
raise
our
eyes
and
look
above
all
there
is
blue
behold
that
diadem
of
stars
here
the
tints
of
earthly
impressions
disappear
standing
on
this
nature
rarefied
by
space
do
you
not
feel
within
you
something
deeper
far
than
mind
grander
than
enthusiasm
of
greater
energy
than
will
are
you
not
conscious
of
emotions
whose
interpretation
is
no
longer
in
us
do
you
not
feel
your
pinions
let
us
seraphitus
knelt
down
and
crossed
his
hands
upon
his
breast
while
minna
fell
weeping
on
her
knees
thus
they
remained
for
a
time
while
the
azure
dome
above
their
heads
grew
larger
and
strong
rays
of
light
enveloped
them
without
their
knowledge
why
dost
thou
not
weep
when
i
weep
said
minna
in
a
broken
voice
they
who
are
all
spirit
do
not
weep
replied
seraphitus
rising
why
should
i
weep
i
see
no
longer
human
wretchedness
here
good
appears
in
all
its
majesty
there
beneath
us
i
hear
the
supplications
and
the
wailings
of
that
harp
of
sorrows
which
vibrates
in
the
hands
of
captive
souls
here
i
listen
to
the
choir
of
harps
harmonious
there
below
is
hope
the
glorious
inception
of
faith
but
here
is
faith
it
reigns
hope
realized
you
will
never
love
me
i
am
too
imperfect
you
disdain
me
said
the
young
girl
minna
the
violet
hidden
at
the
feet
of
the
oak
whispers
to
itself
the
sun
does
not
love
me
he
comes
the
sun
says
if
my
rays
shine
upon
her
she
will
perish
poor
friend
of
the
flower
he
sends
his
beams
through
the
oak
leaves
he
veils
he
tempers
them
and
thus
they
color
the
petals
of
his
beloved
i
have
not
veils
enough
i
fear
lest
you
see
me
too
closely
you
would
tremble
if
you
knew
me
better
listen
i
have
no
taste
for
earthly
fruits
your
joys
i
know
them
all
too
well
and
like
the
sated
emperors
of
pagan
rome
i
have
reached
disgust
of
all
things
i
have
received
the
gift
of
vision
leave
me
abandon
me
he
murmured
sorrowfully
seraphitus
turned
and
seated
himself
on
a
projecting
rock
dropping
his
head
upon
his
breast
why
do
you
drive
me
to
despair
said
minna
go
go
cried
seraphitus
i
have
nothing
that
you
want
of
me
your
love
is
too
earthly
for
my
love
why
do
you
not
love
wilfrid
wilfrid
is
a
man
tested
by
passions
he
would
clasp
you
in
his
vigorous
arms
and
make
you
feel
a
hand
both
broad
and
strong
his
hair
is
black
his
eyes
are
full
of
human
thoughts
his
heart
pours
lava
in
every
word
he
utters
he
could
kill
you
with
caresses
let
him
be
your
beloved
your
husband
yes
thine
be
wilfrid
minna
wept
aloud
dare
you
say
that
you
do
not
love
him
he
went
on
in
a
voice
which
pierced
her
like
a
dagger
have
mercy
have
mercy
my
seraphitus
love
him
poor
child
of
earth
to
which
thy
destiny
has
indissolubly
bound
thee
said
the
strange
being
beckoning
minna
by
a
gesture
and
forcing
her
to
the
edge
of
the
saeter
whence
he
pointed
downward
to
a
scene
that
might
well
inspire
a
young
girl
full
of
enthusiasm
with
the
fancy
that
she
stood
above
this
earth
i
longed
for
a
companion
to
the
kingdom
of
light
i
wished
to
show
you
that
morsel
of
mud
i
find
you
bound

the
senses

in
all
your

have
a
companion

can
laugh
and

and

and

i
i
am
an
exile
far
from
heaven
a
monster
far
from
earth
i
live
of
myself
and
by
myself
i
feel
by
the
spirit
i
breathe
through
my
brow
i
see
by

i
die
of
impatience
and
of
longing
no
one
here
below
can
fulfil
my
desires
or
calm
my
griefs
i

forgotten
how

and
i
seraphitus
looked
at
the
flowery
mound
on
which
he
had
seated
minna
then
he
turned
and
faced
the
frowning
heights
whose
pinnacles
were
wrapped
in
clouds
to
them
he
cast
unspoken
the
remainder
of
his
thoughts
minna
do
you
hear
those
delightful
strains
he
said
after
a
pause
with
the
voice
of
a
dove
for
the
eagle
s
cry
was
hushed
it
is
like
the
music
of
those
eolian
harps
your
poets
hang
in
forests
and
on
the
mountains
do
you
see
the
shadowy
figures
passing
among
the
clouds
the
winged
feet
of
those
who
are
making
ready
the
gifts
of
heaven
they
bring
refreshment
to
the
soul
the
skies
are
about
to
open
and
shed
the
flowers
of
spring
upon
the
earth
see
a
gleam
is
darting
from
the
pole
let
us
fly
let
us
fly
it
is
time
we
go
in
a
moment
their
skees
were
refastened
and
the
pair
descended
the
falberg
by
the
steep
slopes
which
join
the
mountain
to
the
valleys
of
the
sieg
miraculous
perception
guided
their
course
or
to
speak
more
properly
their
flight
when
fissures
covered
with
snow
intercepted
them
seraphitus
caught
minna
in
his
arms
and
darted
with
rapid
motion
lightly
as
a
bird
over
the
crumbling
causeways
of
the
abyss
sometimes
while
propelling
his
companion
he
deviated
to
the
right
or
left
to
avoid
a
precipice
a
tree
a
projecting
rock
which
he
seemed
to
see
beneath
the
snow
as
an
old
sailor
familiar
with
the
ocean
discerns
the
hidden
reefs
by
the
color
the
trend
or
the
eddying
of
the
water
when
they
reached
the
paths
of
the
siegdahlen
where
they
could
fearlessly
follow
a
straight
line
to
regain
the
ice
of
the
fiord
seraphitus
stopped
minna
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
he
asked
i
thought
you
would
rather
think
alone
she
answered
respectfully
let
us
hasten
minette
it
is
almost
night
he
said
minna
quivered
as
she
heard
the
voice
now
so
changed
of
her
guide
a
pure
voice
like
that
of
a
young
girl
which
dissolved
the
fantastic
dream
through
which
she
had
been
passing
seraphitus
seemed
to
be
laying
aside
his
male
force
and
the
too
keen
intellect
that
flames
from
his
eyes
presently
the
charming
pair
glided
across
the
fiord
and
reached
the
which
divides
the
shore
from
the
first
range
of
houses
then
hurrying
forward
as
daylight
faded
they
sprang
up
the
hill
toward
the
parsonage
as
though
they
were
mounting
the
steps
of
a
great
staircase
my
father
must
be
anxious
said
minna
no
answered
seraphitus
as
he
spoke
the
couple
reached
the
porch
of
the
humble
dwelling
where
monsieur
becker
the
pastor
of
jarvis
sat
reading
while
awaiting
his
daughter
for
the
evening
meal
dear
monsieur
becker
said
seraphitus
i
have
brought
minna
back
to
you
safe
and
thank
you
mademoiselle
said
the
old
man
laying
his
spectacles
on
his
book
you
must
be
very
oh
no
said
minna
and
as
she
spoke
she
felt
the
soft
breath
of
her
companion
on
her
brow
dear
heart
will
you
come
day
after
evening
and
take
tea
with
me
gladly
monsieur
becker
you
will
bring
her
will
you
not
yes
seraphitus
inclined
his
head
with
a
pretty
gesture
and
bowed
to
the
old
pastor
as
he
left
the
house
a
few
moments
later
he
reached
the
great
courtyard
of
the
swedish
villa
an
old
servant
over
eighty
years
of
age
appeared
in
the
portico
bearing
a
lantern
seraphitus
slipped
off
his
with
the
graceful
dexterity
of
a
woman
then
darting
into
the
salon
he
fell
exhausted
and
motionless
on
a
wide
divan
covered
with
furs
what
will
you
take
asked
the
old
man
lighting
the
immensely
tall
that
are
used
in
norway
nothing
david
i
am
too
seraphitus
unfastened
his
pelisse
lined
with
sable
threw
it
over
him
and
fell
asleep
the
old
servant
stood
for
several
minutes
gazing
with
loving
eyes
at
the
singular
being
before
him
whose
sex
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
one
at
that
moment
to
determine
wrapped
as
he
was
in
a
formless
garment
which
resembled
equally
a
woman
s
robe
and
a
man
s
mantle
it
was
impossible
not
to
fancy
that
the
slender
feet
which
hung
at
the
side
of
the
couch
were
those
of
a
woman
and
equally
impossible
not
to
note
how
the
forehead
and
the
outlines
of
the
head
gave
evidence
of
power
brought
to
its
highest
pitch
she
suffers
and
she
will
not
tell
me
thought
the
old
man
she
is
dying
like
a
flower
wilted
by
the
burning
and
the
old
man
wept
chapter
ii
seraphita
later
in
the
evening
david
the
salon
i
know
who
it
is
you
have
come
to
announce
said
seraphita
in
a
sleepy
voice
wilfrid
may
hearing
these
words
a
man
suddenly
presented
himself
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
beside
her
my
dear
seraphita
are
you
ill
he
said
you
look
paler
than
she
turned
slowly
towards
him
tossing
back
her
hair
like
a
pretty
woman
whose
aching
head
leaves
her
no
strength
even
for
complaint
i
was
foolish
enough
to
cross
the
fiord
with
minna
she
said
we
ascended
the
do
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
he
said
with
a
lover
s
terror
no
my
good
wilfrid
i
took
the
greatest
care
of
your
wilfrid
struck
his
hand
violently
on
a
table
rose
hastily
and
made
several
steps
towards
the
door
with
an
exclamation
full
of
pain
then
he
returned
and
seemed
about
to
remonstrate
why
this
disturbance
if
you
think
me
ill
she
said
forgive
me
have
mercy
he
cried
kneeling
beside
her
speak
to
me
harshly
if
you
will
exact
all
that
the
cruel
fancies
of
a
woman
lead
you
to
imagine
i
least
can
bear
but
oh
my
beloved
do
not
doubt
my
love
you
take
minna
like
an
axe
to
hew
me
down
have
mercy
why
do
you
say
these
things
my
friend
when
you
know
that
they
are
useless
she
replied
with
a
look
which
grew
in
the
end
so
soft
that
wilfrid
ceased
to
behold
her
eyes
but
saw
in
their
place
a
fluid
light
the
shimmer
of
which
was
like
the
last
vibrations
of
an
italian
song
ah
no
man
dies
of
anguish
he
murmured
you
are
suffering
she
said
in
a
voice
whose
intonations
produced
upon
his
heart
the
same
effect
as
that
of
her
look
would
i
could
help
you
love
me
as
i
love
poor
minna
she
replied
why
am
i
unarmed
exclaimed
wilfrid
violently
you
are
out
of
temper
said
seraphita
smiling
come
have
i
not
spoken
to
you
like
those
parisian
women
whose
loves
you
tell
of
wilfrid
sat
down
crossed
his
arms
and
looked
gloomily
at
seraphita
i
forgive
you
he
said
for
you
know
not
what
you
you
mistake
she
replied
every
woman
from
the
days
of
eve
does
good
and
evil
i
believe
it
he
said
i
am
sure
of
it
wilfrid
our
instinct
is
precisely
that
which
makes
us
perfect
what
you
men
learn
we
why
then
do
you
not
feel
how
much
i
love
you
because
you
do
not
love
good
god
if
you
did
would
you
complain
of
your
own
sufferings
you
are
terrible
seraphita
you
are
a
no
but
i
am
gifted
with
the
faculty
of
comprehending
and
it
is
awful
wilfrid
sorrow
is
a
lamp
which
illumines
why
did
you
ascend
the
falberg
minna
will
tell
you
i
am
too
weary
to
talk
you
must
talk
to
me
you
who
know
so
much
who
have
learned
all
things
and
forgotten
nothing
you
who
have
passed
through
every
social
test
talk
to
me
amuse
me
i
am
what
can
i
tell
you
that
you
do
not
know
besides
the
request
is
ironical
you
allow
yourself
no
intercourse
with
social
life
you
trample
on
its
conventions
its
laws
its
customs
sentiments
and
sciences
you
reduce
them
all
to
the
proportions
such
things
take
when
viewed
by
you
beyond
this
therefore
you
see
my
friend
that
i
am
not
a
woman
you
do
wrong
to
love
me
what
am
i
to
leave
the
ethereal
regions
of
my
pretended
strength
make
myself
humbly
small
cringe
like
the
hapless
female
of
all
species
that
you
may
lift
me
up
and
then
when
i
helpless
and
broken
ask
you
for
help
when
i
need
your
arm
you
will
repulse
me
no
we
can
never
come
to
you
are
more
maliciously
unkind
than
i
have
ever
known
unkind
she
said
with
a
look
which
seemed
to
blend
all
feelings
into
one
celestial
emotion
no
i
am
ill
i
suffer
that
is
all
leave
me
my
friend
it
is
your
manly
right
we
women
should
ever
please
you
entertain
you
be
gay
in
your
presence
and
have
no
whims
save
those
that
amuse
you
come
what
shall
i
do
for
you
friend
shall
i
sing
shall
i
dance
though
weariness
deprives
me
of
the
use
of
voice
and
limbs
ah
gentlemen
be
we
on
our
deathbeds
we
yet
must
smile
to
please
you
you
call
that
methinks
your
right
poor
women
i
pity
them
tell
me
you
who
abandon
them
when
they
grow
old
is
it
because
they
have
neither
hearts
nor
souls
wilfrid
i
am
a
hundred
years
old
leave
me
leave
me
go
to
minna
oh
my
eternal
love
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
eternity
be
silent
wilfrid
you
desire
me
but
you
do
not
love
me
tell
me
do
i
not
seem
to
you
like
those
coquettish
parisian
women
certainly
i
no
longer
find
you
the
pure
celestial
maiden
i
first
saw
in
the
church
of
at
these
words
seraphita
passed
her
hands
across
her
brow
and
when
she
removed
them
wilfrid
was
amazed
at
the
saintly
expression
that
overspread
her
face
you
are
right
my
friend
she
said
i
do
wrong
whenever
i
set
my
feet
upon
your
oh
seraphita
be
my
star
stay
where
you
can
ever
bless
me
with
that
clear
light
as
he
spoke
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
take
that
of
the
young
girl
but
she
withdrew
it
neither
disdainfully
nor
in
anger
wilfrid
rose
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
window
that
she
might
not
see
the
tears
that
rose
to
his
eyes
why
do
you
weep
she
said
you
are
not
a
child
wilfrid
come
back
to
me
i
wish
it
you
are
annoyed
if
i
show
just
displeasure
you
see
that
i
am
fatigued
and
ill
yet
you
force
me
to
think
and
speak
and
listen
to
persuasions
and
ideas
that
weary
me
if
you
had
any
real
perception
of
my
nature
you
would
have
made
some
music
you
would
have
lulled
my
feelings
but
no
you
love
me
for
yourself
and
not
for
the
storm
which
convulsed
the
young
man
s
heart
calmed
down
at
these
words
he
slowly
approached
her
letting
his
eyes
take
in
the
seductive
creature
who
lay
exhausted
before
him
her
head
resting
in
her
hand
and
her
elbow
on
the
couch
you
think
that
i
do
not
love
you
she
resumed
you
are
mistaken
listen
to
me
wilfrid
you
are
beginning
to
know
much
you
have
suffered
much
let
me
explain
your
thoughts
to
you
you
wished
to
take
my
hand
just
now
she
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
and
her
graceful
motions
seemed
to
emit
light
when
a
young
girl
allows
her
hand
to
be
taken
it
is
as
though
she
made
a
promise
is
it
not
and
ought
she
not
to
fulfil
it
you
well
know
that
i
can
not
be
yours
two
sentiments
divide
and
inspire
the
love
of
all
the
women
of
the
earth
either
they
devote
themselves
to
suffering
degraded
and
criminal
beings
whom
they
desire
to
console
uplift
redeem
or
they
give
themselves
to
superior
men
sublime
and
strong
whom
they
adore
and
seek
to
comprehend
and
by
whom
they
are
often
annihilated
you
have
been
degraded
though
now
you
are
purified
by
the
fires
of
repentance
and
you
are
once
more
noble
but
i
know
myself
too
feeble
to
be
your
equal
and
too
religious
to
bow
before
any
power
but
that
on
high
i
may
refer
thus
to
your
life
my
friend
for
we
are
in
the
north
among
the
clouds
where
all
things
are
you
stab
me
seraphita
when
you
speak
like
this
it
wounds
me
to
hear
you
apply
the
dreadful
knowledge
with
which
you
strip
from
all
things
human
the
properties
that
time
and
space
and
form
have
given
them
and
consider
them
mathematically
in
the
abstract
as
geometry
treats
substances
from
which
it
extracts
well
i
will
respect
your
wishes
wilfrid
let
the
subject
drop
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
bearskin
rug
which
my
poor
david
has
spread
it
is
very
did
you
ever
see
me
wear
this
doucha
greka
she
pointed
to
a
pelisse
made
of
cashmere
and
lined
with
the
skin
of
the
black
fox
the
name
she
gave
it
signifying
warm
to
the
do
you
believe
that
any
sovereign
has
a
fur
that
can
equal
it
she
asked
it
is
worthy
of
her
who
wears
and
whom
you
think
beautiful
human
words
do
not
apply
to
her
heart
to
heart
is
the
only
language
i
can
wilfrid
you
are
kind
to
soothe
my
griefs
with
such
sweet
words
which
you
have
said
to
farewell
stay
i
love
both
you
and
minna
believe
me
to
me
you
two
are
as
one
being
united
thus
you
can
be
my
brother
or
if
you
will
my
sister
marry
her
let
me
see
you
both
happy
before
i
leave
this
world
of
trial
and
of
pain
my
god
the
simplest
of
women
obtain
what
they
ask
of
a
lover
they
whisper
hush
and
he
is
silent
die
and
he
dies
love
me
afar
and
he
stays
at
a
distance
like
courtiers
before
a
king
all
i
desire
is
to
see
you
happy
and
you
refuse
me
am
i
then
powerless
wilfrid
listen
come
nearer
to
me
yes
i
should
grieve
to
see
you
marry
minna
but
when
i
am
here
no
longer
then
promise
me
to
marry
her
heaven
destined
you
for
each
i
listen
to
you
with
fascination
seraphita
your
words
are
incomprehensible
but
they
charm
me
what
is
it
you
mean
to
say
you
are
right
i
forget
to
be
foolish
to
be
the
poor
creature
whose
weaknesses
gratify
you
i
torment
you
wilfrid
you
came
to
these
northern
lands
for
rest
you
by
the
impetuous
struggle
of
genius
unrecognized
you
weary
with
the
patient
toils
of
science
you
who
dyed
your
hands
in
crime
and
wore
the
fetters
of
human
justice
wilfrid
dropped
speechless
on
the
carpet
seraphita
breathed
softly
on
his
forehead
and
in
a
moment
he
fell
asleep
at
her
feet
sleep
rest
she
said
rising
she
passed
her
hands
over
wilfrid
s
brow
then
the
following
sentences
escaped
her
lips
one
by
one
all
different
in
tone
and
accent
but
all
melodious
full
of
a
goodness
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
her
head
in
vaporous
waves
like
the
gleams
the
goddess
chastely
lays
upon
endymion
sleeping
i
can
not
show
myself
such
as
i
am
to
thee
dear
wilfrid
to
thee
who
art
strong
the
hour
is
come
the
hour
when
the
effulgent
lights
of
the
future
cast
their
reflections
backward
on
the
soul
the
hour
when
the
soul
awakes
into
freedom
now
am
i
permitted
to
tell
thee
how
i
love
thee
dost
thou
not
see
the
nature
of
my
love
a
love
without
a
sentiment
full
of
thee
thee
only
a
love
which
follows
thee
into
the
future
to
light
that
future
for
thee
for
it
is
the
one
true
light
canst
thou
now
conceive
with
what
ardor
i
would
have
thee
leave
this
life
which
weighs
thee
down
and
behold
thee
nearer
than
thou
art
to
that
world
where
love
is
can
it
be
aught
but
suffering
to
love
for
one
life
only
hast
thou
not
felt
a
thirst
for
the
eternal
love
dost
thou
not
feel
the
bliss
to
which
a
creature
rises
when
with
it
loves
the
being
who
betrays
not
love
him
before
whom
we
kneel
in
adoration
would
i
had
wings
to
cover
thee
wilfrid
power
to
give
thee
strength
to
enter
now
into
that
world
where
all
the
purest
joys
of
purest
earthly
attachments
are
but
shadows
in
the
light
that
shines
unceasing
to
illumine
and
rejoice
all
hearts
forgive
a
friendly
soul
for
showing
thee
the
picture
of
thy
sins
in
the
charitable
hope
of
soothing
the
sharp
pangs
of
thy
remorse
listen
to
the
pardoning
choir
refresh
thy
soul
in
the
dawn
now
rising
for
thee
beyond
the
night
of
death
yes
thy
life
thy
true
life
is
there
may
my
words
now
reach
thee
clothed
in
the
glorious
forms
of
dreams
may
they
deck
themselves
with
images
glowing
and
radiant
as
they
hover
round
you
rise
rise
to
the
height
where
men
can
see
themselves
distinctly
pressed
together
though
they
be
like
grains
of
sand
upon
a
humanity
rolls
out
like
a
ribbon
see
the
diverse
shades
of
that
flower
of
the
celestial
gardens
behold
the
beings
who
lack
intelligence
those
who
begin
to
receive
it
those
who
have
passed
through
trials
those
who
love
those
who
follow
wisdom
and
aspire
to
the
regions
of
light
canst
thou
comprehend
through
this
thought
made
visible
the
destiny
of
humanity
whence
it
came
whither
to
goeth
continue
steadfast
in
the
path
reaching
the
end
of
thy
journey
thou
shalt
hear
the
clarions
of
omnipotence
sounding
the
cries
of
victory
in
chords
of
which
a
single
one
would
shake
the
earth
but
which
are
lost
in
the
spaces
of
a
world
that
hath
neither
east
nor
west
canst
thou
comprehend
my
poor
beloved
that
unless
the
torpor
and
the
veils
of
sleep
had
wrapped
thee
such
sights
would
rend
and
bear
away
thy
mind
as
the
whirlwinds
rend
and
carry
into
space
the
feeble
sails
depriving
thee
forever
of
thy
reason
dost
thou
understand
that
the
soul
itself
raised
to
its
utmost
power
can
scarcely
endure
in
dreams
the
burning
communications
of
the
spirit
speed
thy
way
through
the
luminous
spheres
behold
admire
hasten
flying
thus
thou
canst
pause
or
advance
without
weariness
like
other
men
thou
wouldst
fain
be
plunged
forever
in
these
spheres
of
light
and
perfume
where
now
thou
art
free
of
thy
swooning
body
and
where
thy
thought
alone
has
utterance
fly
enjoy
for
a
fleeting
moment
the
wings
thou
shalt
surely
win
when
love
has
grown
so
perfect
in
thee
that
thou
hast
no
senses
left
when
thy
whole
being
is
all
mind
all
love
the
higher
thy
flight
the
less
canst
thou
see
the
abysses
there
are
none
in
heaven
look
at
the
friend
who
speaks
to
thee
she
who
holds
thee
above
this
earth
in
which
are
all
abysses
look
behold
contemplate
me
yet
a
moment
longer
for
never
again
wilt
thou
see
me
save
imperfectly
as
the
pale
twilight
of
this
world
may
show
me
to
seraphita
stood
erect
her
head
with
floating
hair
inclining
gently
forward
in
that
aerial
attitude
which
great
painters
give
to
messengers
from
heaven
the
folds
of
her
raiment
fell
with
the
same
unspeakable
grace
which
holds
an
artist
the
man
who
translates
all
things
into
sentiment
before
the
exquisite
lines
of
polyhymnia
s
veil
then
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
wilfrid
rose
when
he
looked
at
seraphita
she
was
lying
on
the
bear
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
her
face
calm
her
eyes
brilliant
wilfrid
gazed
at
her
silently
but
his
face
betrayed
a
deferential
fear
in
its
almost
timid
expression
yes
dear
he
said
at
last
as
though
he
were
answering
some
question
we
are
separated
by
worlds
i
resign
myself
i
can
only
adore
you
but
what
will
become
of
me
poor
and
alone
wilfrid
you
have
he
shook
his
head
do
not
be
so
disdainful
woman
understands
all
things
through
love
what
she
does
not
understand
she
feels
what
she
does
not
feel
she
sees
when
she
neither
sees
nor
feels
nor
understands
this
angel
of
earth
divines
to
protect
you
and
hides
her
protection
beneath
the
grace
of
seraphita
am
i
worthy
to
belong
to
a
woman
ah
now
she
said
smiling
you
are
suddenly
very
modest
is
it
a
snare
a
woman
is
always
so
touched
to
see
her
weakness
glorified
well
come
and
take
tea
with
me
the
day
after
evening
good
monsieur
becker
will
be
here
and
minna
the
purest
and
most
artless
creature
i
have
known
on
earth
leave
me
now
my
friend
i
need
to
make
long
prayers
and
expiate
my
you
can
you
commit
sin
poor
friend
if
we
abuse
our
power
is
not
that
the
sin
of
pride
i
have
been
very
proud
now
leave
me
till
till
said
wilfrid
faintly
casting
a
long
glance
at
the
being
of
whom
he
desired
to
carry
with
him
an
ineffaceable
memory
though
he
wished
to
go
far
away
he
was
held
as
it
were
outside
the
house
for
some
moments
watching
the
light
which
shone
from
all
the
windows
of
the
swedish
dwelling
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
asked
himself
no
she
is
not
a
mere
creature
but
a
whole
creation
of
her
world
even
through
veils
and
clouds
i
have
caught
echoes
like
the
memory
of
sufferings
healed
like
the
dazzling
vertigo
of
dreams
in
which
we
hear
the
plaints
of
generations
mingling
with
the
harmonies
of
some
higher
sphere
where
all
is
light
and
all
is
love
am
i
awake
do
i
still
sleep
are
these
the
eyes
before
which
the
luminous
space
retreated
further
and
further
indefinitely
while
the
eyes
followed
it
the
night
is
cold
yet
my
head
is
on
fire
i
will
go
to
the
parsonage
with
the
pastor
and
his
daughter
i
shall
recover
the
balance
of
my
but
still
he
did
not
leave
the
spot
whence
his
eyes
could
plunge
into
seraphita
s
salon
the
mysterious
creature
seemed
to
him
the
radiating
centre
of
a
luminous
circle
which
formed
an
atmosphere
about
her
wider
than
that
of
other
beings
whoever
entered
it
felt
the
compelling
influence
of
as
it
were
a
vortex
of
dazzling
light
and
all
consuming
thoughts
forced
to
struggle
against
this
inexplicable
power
wilfrid
only
prevailed
after
strong
efforts
but
when
he
reached
and
passed
the
inclosing
wall
of
the
courtyard
he
regained
his
freedom
of
will
walked
rapidly
towards
the
parsonage
and
was
soon
beneath
the
high
wooden
arch
which
formed
a
sort
of
peristyle
to
monsieur
becker
s
dwelling
he
opened
the
first
door
against
which
the
wind
had
driven
the
snow
and
knocked
on
the
inner
one
saying
will
you
let
me
spend
the
evening
with
you
monsieur
becker
yes
cried
two
voices
mingling
their
intonations
entering
the
parlor
wilfrid
returned
by
degrees
to
real
life
he
bowed
affectionately
to
minna
shook
hands
with
monsieur
becker
and
looked
about
at
the
picture
of
a
home
which
calmed
the
convulsions
of
his
physical
nature
in
which
a
phenomenon
was
taking
place
analogous
to
that
which
sometimes
seizes
upon
men
who
have
given
themselves
up
to
protracted
contemplations
if
some
strong
thought
bears
upward
on
phantasmal
wing
a
man
of
learning
or
a
poet
isolates
him
from
the
external
circumstances
which
environ
him
here
below
and
leads
him
forward
through
illimitable
regions
where
vast
arrays
of
facts
become
abstractions
where
the
greatest
works
of
nature
are
but
images
then
woe
betide
him
if
a
sudden
noise
strikes
sharply
on
his
senses
and
calls
his
errant
soul
back
to
its
of
flesh
and
bones
the
shock
of
the
reunion
of
these
two
powers
body
and
mind
one
of
which
partakes
of
the
unseen
qualities
of
a
thunderbolt
while
the
other
shares
with
sentient
nature
that
soft
resistant
force
which
deifies
destruction
this
shock
this
struggle
or
rather
let
us
say
this
painful
meeting
and
gives
rise
to
frightful
sufferings
the
body
receives
back
the
flame
that
consumes
it
the
flame
has
once
more
grasped
its
prey
this
fusion
however
does
not
take
place
without
convulsions
explosions
tortures
analogous
and
visible
signs
of
which
may
be
seen
in
chemistry
when
two
antagonistic
substances
which
science
has
united
separate
for
the
last
few
days
whenever
wilfrid
entered
seraphita
s
presence
his
body
seemed
to
fall
away
from
him
into
nothingness
with
a
single
glance
this
strange
being
led
him
in
spirit
through
the
spheres
where
meditation
leads
the
learned
man
prayer
the
pious
heart
where
vision
transports
the
artist
and
sleep
the
souls
of
men
each
and
all
have
their
own
path
to
the
height
their
own
guide
to
reach
it
their
own
individual
sufferings
in
the
dire
return
in
that
sphere
alone
all
veils
are
rent
away
and
the
revelation
the
awful
flaming
certainty
of
an
unknown
world
of
which
the
soul
brings
back
mere
fragments
to
this
lower
sphere
stands
revealed
to
wilfrid
one
hour
passed
with
seraphita
was
like
the
dreams
of
theriakis
in
which
each
knot
of
nerves
becomes
the
centre
of
a
radiating
delight
but
he
left
her
bruised
and
wearied
as
some
young
girl
endeavoring
to
keep
step
with
a
giant
the
cold
air
with
its
stinging
flagellations
had
begun
to
still
the
nervous
tremors
which
followed
the
reunion
of
his
two
natures
so
powerfully
disunited
for
a
time
he
was
drawn
towards
the
parsonage
then
towards
minna
by
the
sight
of
the
home
life
for
which
he
thirsted
as
the
wandering
european
thirsts
for
his
native
land
when
nostalgia
seizes
him
amid
the
fairy
scenes
of
orient
that
have
seduced
his
senses
more
weary
than
he
had
ever
yet
been
wilfrid
dropped
into
a
chair
and
looked
about
him
for
a
time
like
a
man
who
awakens
from
sleep
monsieur
becker
and
his
daughter
accustomed
perhaps
to
the
apparent
eccentricity
of
their
guest
continued
the
employments
in
which
they
were
engaged
the
parlor
was
ornamented
with
a
collection
of
the
shells
and
insects
of
norway
these
curiosities
admirably
arranged
on
a
background
of
the
yellow
pine
which
panelled
the
room
formed
as
it
were
a
rich
tapestry
to
which
the
fumes
of
tobacco
had
imparted
a
mellow
tone
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
opposite
to
the
door
was
an
immense
stove
carefully
polished
by
the
till
it
shone
like
burnished
steel
seated
in
a
large
tapestried
armchair
near
the
stove
before
a
table
with
his
feet
in
a
species
of
muff
monsieur
becker
was
reading
a
folio
volume
which
was
propped
against
a
pile
of
other
books
as
on
a
desk
at
his
left
stood
a
jug
of
beer
and
a
glass
at
his
right
burned
a
smoky
lamp
fed
by
some
species
of
the
pastor
seemed
about
sixty
years
of
age
his
face
belonged
to
a
type
often
painted
by
rembrandt
the
same
small
bright
eyes
set
in
wrinkles
and
surmounted
by
thick
gray
eyebrows
the
same
white
hair
escaping
in
snowy
flakes
from
a
black
velvet
cap
the
same
broad
bald
brow
and
a
contour
of
face
which
the
ample
chin
made
almost
square
and
lastly
the
same
calm
tranquillity
which
to
an
observer
denoted
the
possession
of
some
inward
power
be
it
the
supremacy
bestowed
by
money
or
the
magisterial
influence
of
the
burgomaster
or
the
consciousness
of
art
or
the
cubic
force
of
blissful
ignorance
this
fine
old
man
whose
stout
body
proclaimed
his
vigorous
health
was
wrapped
in
a
of
rough
gray
cloth
plainly
bound
between
his
lips
was
a
meerschaum
pipe
from
which
at
regular
intervals
he
blew
the
smoke
following
with
abstracted
vision
its
fantastic
wreathings
his
mind
employed
no
doubt
in
assimilating
through
some
meditative
process
the
thoughts
of
the
author
whose
works
he
was
studying
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
and
near
a
door
which
communicated
with
the
kitchen
minna
was
indistinctly
visible
in
the
haze
of
the
good
man
s
smoke
to
which
she
was
apparently
accustomed
beside
her
on
a
little
table
were
the
implements
of
household
work
a
pile
of
napkins
and
another
of
socks
waiting
to
be
mended
also
a
lamp
like
that
which
shone
on
the
white
page
of
the
book
in
which
the
pastor
was
absorbed
her
fresh
young
face
with
its
delicate
outline
expressed
an
infinite
purity
which
harmonized
with
the
candor
of
the
white
brow
and
the
clear
blue
eyes
she
sat
erect
turning
slightly
toward
the
lamp
for
better
light
unconsciously
showing
as
she
did
so
the
beauty
of
her
waist
and
bust
she
was
already
dressed
for
the
night
in
a
long
robe
of
white
cotton
a
cambric
cap
without
other
ornament
than
a
frill
of
the
same
confined
her
hair
though
evidently
plunged
in
some
inward
meditation
she
counted
without
a
mistake
the
threads
of
her
napkins
or
the
meshes
of
her
socks
sitting
thus
she
presented
the
most
complete
image
the
truest
type
of
the
woman
destined
for
terrestrial
labor
whose
glance
may
piece
the
clouds
of
the
sanctuary
while
her
thought
humble
and
charitable
keeps
her
ever
on
the
level
of
man
wilfrid
had
flung
himself
into
a
chair
between
the
two
tables
and
was
contemplating
with
a
species
of
intoxication
this
picture
full
of
harmony
to
which
the
clouds
of
smoke
did
no
despite
the
single
window
which
lighted
the
parlor
during
the
fine
weather
was
now
carefully
closed
an
old
tapestry
used
for
a
curtain
and
fastened
to
a
stick
hung
before
it
in
heavy
folds
nothing
in
the
room
was
picturesque
nothing
brilliant
everything
denoted
rigorous
simplicity
true
heartiness
the
ease
of
unconventional
nature
and
the
habits
of
a
domestic
life
which
knew
neither
cares
nor
troubles
many
a
dwelling
is
like
a
dream
the
sparkle
of
passing
pleasure
seems
to
hide
some
ruin
beneath
the
cold
smile
of
luxury
but
this
parlor
sublime
in
reality
harmonious
in
tone
diffused
the
patriarchal
ideas
of
a
full
and
existence
the
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
movements
of
the
servant
in
the
kitchen
engaged
in
preparing
the
supper
and
by
the
sizzling
of
the
dried
fish
which
she
was
frying
in
salt
butter
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
will
you
smoke
a
pipe
said
the
pastor
seizing
a
moment
when
he
thought
that
wilfrid
might
listen
to
him
thank
you
no
dear
monsieur
becker
replied
the
visitor
you
seem
to
suffer
more
than
usual
said
minna
struck
by
the
feeble
tones
of
the
stranger
s
voice
i
am
always
so
when
i
leave
the
minna
quivered
a
strange
being
lives
there
monsieur
becker
he
continued
after
a
pause
for
the
six
months
that
i
have
been
in
this
village
i
have
never
yet
dared
to
question
you
about
her
and
even
now
i
do
violence
to
my
feelings
in
speaking
of
her
i
began
by
keenly
regretting
that
my
journey
in
this
country
was
arrested
by
the
winter
weather
and
that
i
was
forced
to
remain
here
but
during
the
last
two
months
chains
have
been
forged
and
riveted
which
bind
me
irrevocably
to
jarvis
till
now
i
fear
to
end
my
days
here
you
know
how
i
first
met
seraphita
what
impression
her
look
and
voice
made
upon
me
and
how
at
last
i
was
admitted
to
her
home
where
she
receives
no
one
from
the
very
first
day
i
have
longed
to
ask
you
the
history
of
this
mysterious
being
on
that
day
began
for
me
a
series
of
enchantments
cried
the
pastor
shaking
the
ashes
of
his
pipe
into
an
dish
full
of
sand
are
there
enchantments
in
these
days
you
who
are
carefully
studying
at
this
moment
that
volume
of
the
incantations
of
jean
wier
will
surely
understand
the
explanation
of
my
sensations
if
i
try
to
give
it
to
you
replied
wilfrid
if
we
study
nature
attentively
in
its
great
evolutions
as
in
its
minutest
works
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
the
possibility
of
enchantment
giving
to
that
word
its
exact
significance
man
does
not
create
forces
he
employs
the
only
force
that
exists
and
which
includes
all
others
namely
motion
the
breath
incomprehensible
of
the
sovereign
maker
of
the
universe
species
are
too
distinctly
separated
for
the
human
hand
to
mingle
them
the
only
miracle
of
which
man
is
capable
is
done
through
the
conjunction
of
two
antagonistic
substances
gunpowder
for
instance
is
germane
to
a
thunderbolt
as
to
calling
forth
a
creation
and
a
sudden
one
all
creation
demands
time
and
time
neither
recedes
nor
advances
at
the
word
of
command
so
in
the
world
without
us
plastic
nature
obeys
laws
the
order
and
exercise
of
which
can
not
be
interfered
with
by
the
hand
of
man
but
after
fulfilling
as
it
were
the
function
of
matter
it
would
be
unreasonable
not
to
recognize
within
us
the
existence
of
a
gigantic
power
the
effects
of
which
are
so
incommensurable
that
the
known
generations
of
men
have
never
yet
been
able
to
classify
them
i
do
not
speak
of
man
s
faculty
of
abstraction
of
constraining
nature
to
confine
itself
within
the
word
a
gigantic
act
on
which
the
common
mind
reflects
as
little
as
it
does
on
the
nature
of
motion
but
which
nevertheless
has
led
the
indian
theosophists
to
explain
creation
by
a
word
to
which
they
give
an
inverse
power
the
smallest
atom
of
their
subsistence
namely
the
grain
of
rice
from
which
a
creation
issues
and
in
which
alternately
creation
again
is
held
presented
to
their
minds
so
perfect
an
image
of
the
creative
word
and
of
the
abstractive
word
that
to
them
it
was
easy
to
apply
the
same
system
to
the
creation
of
worlds
the
majority
of
men
content
themselves
with
the
grain
of
rice
sown
in
the
first
chapter
of
all
the
geneses
saint
john
when
he
said
the
word
was
god
only
complicated
the
difficulty
but
the
fructification
germination
and
efflorescence
of
our
ideas
is
of
little
consequence
if
we
compare
that
property
shared
by
many
men
with
the
wholly
individual
faculty
of
communicating
to
that
property
by
some
mysterious
concentration
forces
that
are
more
or
less
active
of
carrying
it
up
to
a
third
a
ninth
or
a
power
of
making
it
thus
fasten
upon
the
masses
and
obtain
magical
results
by
condensing
the
processes
of
nature
what
i
mean
by
enchantments
continued
wilfrid
after
a
moment
s
pause
are
those
stupendous
actions
taking
place
between
two
membranes
in
the
tissue
of
the
brain
we
find
in
the
unexplorable
nature
of
the
spiritual
world
certain
beings
armed
with
these
wondrous
faculties
comparable
only
to
the
terrible
power
of
certain
gases
in
the
physical
world
beings
who
combine
with
other
beings
penetrate
them
as
active
agents
and
produce
upon
them
witchcrafts
charms
against
which
these
helpless
slaves
are
wholly
defenceless
they
are
in
fact
enchanted
brought
under
subjection
reduced
to
a
condition
of
dreadful
vassalage
such
mysterious
beings
overpower
others
with
the
sceptre
and
the
glory
of
a
superior
nature
acting
upon
them
at
times
like
the
torpedo
which
electrifies
or
paralyzes
the
fisherman
at
other
times
like
a
dose
of
phosphorous
which
stimulates
life
and
accelerates
its
propulsion
or
again
like
opium
which
puts
to
sleep
corporeal
nature
disengages
the
spirit
from
every
bond
enables
it
to
float
above
the
world
and
shows
this
earth
to
the
spiritual
eye
as
through
a
prism
extracting
from
it
the
food
most
needed
or
yet
again
like
catalepsy
which
deadens
all
faculties
for
the
sake
of
one
only
vision
miracles
enchantments
incantations
witchcrafts
spells
and
charms
in
short
all
those
acts
improperly
termed
supernatural
are
only
possible
and
can
only
be
explained
by
the
despotism
with
which
some
spirit
compels
us
to
feel
the
effects
of
a
mysterious
optic
which
increases
or
diminishes
or
exalts
creation
moves
within
us
as
it
pleases
deforms
or
embellishes
all
things
to
our
eyes
tears
us
from
heaven
or
drags
us
to
hell
two
terms
by
which
men
agree
to
express
the
two
extremes
of
joy
and
misery
these
phenomena
are
within
us
not
without
us
wilfrid
went
on
the
being
whom
we
call
seraphita
seems
to
me
one
of
those
rare
and
terrible
spirits
to
whom
power
is
given
to
bind
men
to
crush
nature
to
enter
into
participation
of
the
occult
power
of
god
the
course
of
her
enchantments
over
me
began
on
that
first
day
when
silence
as
to
her
was
imposed
upon
me
against
my
will
each
time
that
i
have
wished
to
question
you
it
seemed
as
though
i
were
about
to
reveal
a
secret
of
which
i
ought
to
be
the
incorruptible
guardian
whenever
i
have
tried
to
speak
a
burning
seal
has
been
laid
upon
my
lips
and
i
myself
have
become
the
involuntary
minister
of
these
mysteries
you
see
me
here
for
the
hundredth
time
bruised
defeated
broken
after
leaving
the
hallucinating
sphere
which
surrounds
that
young
girl
so
gentle
so
fragile
to
both
of
you
but
to
me
the
cruellest
of
magicians
yes
to
me
she
is
like
a
sorcerer
holding
in
her
right
hand
the
invisible
wand
that
moves
the
globe
and
in
her
left
the
thunderbolt
that
rends
asunder
all
things
at
her
will
no
longer
can
i
look
upon
her
brow
the
light
of
it
is
insupportable
i
skirt
the
borders
of
the
abyss
of
madness
too
closely
to
be
longer
silent
i
must
speak
i
seize
this
moment
when
courage
comes
to
me
to
resist
the
power
which
drags
me
onward
without
inquiring
whether
or
not
i
have
the
force
to
follow
who
is
she
did
you
know
her
young
what
of
her
birth
had
she
father
and
mother
or
was
she
born
of
the
conjunction
of
ice
and
sun
she
burns
and
yet
she
freeze
she
shows
herself
and
then
withdraws
she
attracts
me
and
repulses
me
she
brings
me
life
she
gives
me
death
i
love
her
and
yet
i
hate
her
i
can
not
live
thus
let
me
be
wholly
in
heaven
or
in
hell
holding
his
refilled
pipe
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
cover
which
he
forgot
to
replace
monsieur
becker
listened
to
wilfrid
with
a
mysterious
expression
on
his
face
looking
occasionally
at
his
daughter
who
seemed
to
understand
the
man
s
language
as
in
harmony
with
the
strange
being
who
inspired
it
wilfrid
was
splendid
to
behold
at
this
moment
like
hamlet
listening
to
the
ghost
of
his
father
as
it
rises
for
him
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
living
this
is
certainly
the
language
of
a
man
in
love
said
the
good
pastor
innocently
in
love
cried
wilfrid
yes
to
common
minds
but
dear
monsieur
becker
no
words
can
express
the
frenzy
which
draws
me
to
the
feet
of
that
unearthly
then
you
do
love
her
said
minna
in
a
tone
of
reproach
mademoiselle
i
feel
such
extraordinary
agitation
when
i
see
her
and
such
deep
sadness
when
i
see
her
no
more
that
in
any
other
man
what
i
feel
would
be
called
love
but
that
sentiment
draws
those
who
feel
it
ardently
together
whereas
between
her
and
me
a
great
gulf
lies
whose
icy
coldness
penetrates
my
very
being
in
her
presence
though
the
feeling
dies
away
when
i
see
her
no
longer
i
leave
her
in
despair
i
return
to
her
with
ardor
like
men
of
science
who
seek
a
secret
from
nature
only
to
be
baffled
or
like
the
painter
who
would
fain
put
life
upon
his
canvas
and
strives
with
all
the
resources
of
his
art
in
the
vain
monsieur
all
that
you
say
is
true
replied
the
young
girl
artlessly
how
can
you
know
minna
asked
the
old
pastor
ah
my
father
had
you
been
with
us
this
morning
on
the
summit
of
the
falberg
had
you
seen
him
praying
you
would
not
ask
me
that
question
you
would
say
like
monsieur
wilfrid
that
he
saw
his
seraphita
for
the
first
time
in
our
temple
it
is
the
spirit
of
these
words
were
followed
by
a
moment
s
silence
ah
truly
said
wilfrid
she
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
creatures
who
grovel
upon
this
on
the
falberg
said
the
old
pastor
how
could
you
get
there
i
do
not
know
replied
minna
the
way
is
like
a
dream
to
me
of
which
no
more
than
a
memory
remains
perhaps
i
should
hardly
believe
that
i
had
been
there
were
it
not
for
this
tangible
she
drew
the
flower
from
her
bosom
and
showed
it
to
them
all
three
gazed
at
the
pretty
saxifrage
which
was
still
fresh
and
now
shone
in
the
light
of
the
two
lamps
like
a
third
luminary
this
is
indeed
supernatural
said
the
old
man
astounded
at
the
sight
of
a
flower
blooming
in
winter
a
mystery
cried
wilfrid
intoxicated
with
its
perfume
the
flower
makes
me
giddy
said
minna
i
fancy
i
still
hear
that
voice
the
music
of
thought
that
i
still
see
the
light
of
that
look
which
is
i
implore
you
my
dear
monsieur
becker
tell
me
the
history
of
seraphita
enigmatical
human
flower
whose
image
is
before
us
in
this
mysterious
my
dear
friend
said
the
old
man
emitting
a
puff
of
smoke
to
explain
the
birth
of
that
being
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
disperse
the
clouds
which
envelop
the
most
obscure
of
christian
doctrines
it
is
not
easy
to
make
myself
clear
when
speaking
of
that
incomprehensible
revelation
the
last
effulgence
of
faith
that
has
shone
upon
our
lump
of
mud
do
you
know
swedenborg
by
name
only
of
him
of
his
books
and
his
religion
i
know
then
i
must
relate
to
you
the
whole
chronicle
of
chapter
iii
after
a
pause
during
which
the
pastor
seemed
to
be
gathering
his
recollections
he
continued
in
the
following
words
emanuel
swedenborg
was
born
at
upsala
in
sweden
in
the
month
of
january
according
to
various
authors
in
according
to
his
epitaph
his
father
was
bishop
of
skara
swedenborg
lived
years
his
death
occurred
in
london
march
i
use
that
term
to
convey
the
idea
of
a
simple
change
of
state
according
to
his
disciples
swedenborg
was
seen
at
jarvis
and
in
paris
after
that
date
allow
me
my
dear
monsieur
wilfrid
said
monsieur
becker
making
a
gesture
to
prevent
all
interruption
i
relate
these
facts
without
either
affirming
or
denying
them
listen
afterwards
you
can
think
and
say
what
you
like
i
will
inform
you
when
i
judge
criticise
and
discuss
these
doctrines
so
as
to
keep
clearly
in
view
my
own
intellectual
neutrality
between
him
and
reason
the
life
of
swedenborg
was
divided
into
two
parts
continued
the
pastor
from
to
baron
emanuel
swedenborg
appeared
in
the
world
as
a
man
of
vast
learning
esteemed
and
cherished
for
his
virtues
always
irreproachable
and
constantly
useful
while
fulfilling
high
public
functions
in
sweden
he
published
between
and
several
important
works
on
mineralogy
physics
mathematics
and
astronomy
which
enlightened
the
world
of
learning
he
originated
a
method
of
building
docks
suitable
for
the
reception
of
large
vessels
and
he
wrote
many
treatises
on
various
important
questions
such
as
the
rise
of
tides
the
theory
of
the
magnet
and
its
qualities
the
motion
and
position
of
the
earth
and
planets
and
while
assessor
in
the
royal
college
of
mines
on
the
proper
system
of
working
salt
mines
he
discovered
means
to
construct
or
sluices
and
he
also
discovered
and
applied
the
simplest
methods
of
extracting
ore
and
of
working
metals
in
fact
he
studied
no
science
without
advancing
it
in
youth
he
learned
hebrew
greek
and
latin
also
the
oriental
languages
with
which
he
became
so
familiar
that
many
distinguished
scholars
consulted
him
and
he
was
able
to
decipher
the
vestiges
of
the
oldest
known
books
of
scripture
namely
the
wars
of
jehovah
and
the
enunciations
spoken
of
by
moses
numbers
xxi
also
by
joshua
jeremiah
and
samuel
the
wars
of
jehovah
being
the
historical
part
and
the
enunciations
the
prophetical
part
of
the
mosaical
books
anterior
to
genesis
swedenborg
even
affirms
that
the
book
of
jasher
the
book
of
the
righteous
mentioned
by
joshua
was
in
existence
in
eastern
tartary
together
with
the
doctrine
of
correspondences
a
frenchman
has
lately
so
they
tell
me
justified
these
statements
of
swedenborg
by
the
discovery
at
bagdad
of
several
portions
of
the
bible
hitherto
unknown
to
europe
during
the
widespread
discussion
on
animal
magnetism
which
took
its
rise
in
paris
and
in
which
most
men
of
western
science
took
an
active
part
about
the
year
monsieur
le
marquis
de
thome
vindicated
the
memory
of
swedenborg
by
calling
attention
to
certain
assertions
made
by
the
commission
appointed
by
the
king
of
france
to
investigate
the
subject
these
gentlemen
declared
that
no
theory
of
magnetism
existed
whereas
swedenborg
had
studied
and
promulgated
it
ever
since
the
year
monsieur
de
thome
seizes
this
opportunity
to
show
the
reason
why
so
many
men
of
science
relegated
swedenborg
to
oblivion
while
they
delved
into
his
and
took
his
facts
to
aid
their
work
some
of
the
most
illustrious
of
these
men
said
monsieur
de
thome
alluding
to
the
theory
of
the
earth
by
buffon
have
had
the
meanness
to
wear
the
plumage
of
the
noble
bird
and
refuse
him
all
acknowledgment
and
he
proved
by
masterly
quotations
drawn
from
the
encyclopaedic
works
of
swedenborg
that
the
great
prophet
had
anticipated
by
over
a
century
the
slow
march
of
human
science
it
suffices
to
read
his
philosophical
and
mineralogical
works
to
be
convinced
of
this
in
one
passage
he
is
seen
as
the
precursor
of
modern
chemistry
by
the
announcement
that
the
productions
of
organized
nature
are
decomposable
and
resolve
into
two
simple
principles
also
that
water
air
and
fire
are
in
another
he
goes
in
a
few
words
to
the
heart
of
magnetic
mysteries
and
deprives
mesmer
of
the
honors
of
a
first
knowledge
of
them
there
said
monsieur
becker
pointing
to
a
long
shelf
against
the
wall
between
the
stove
and
the
window
on
which
were
ranged
books
of
all
sizes
behold
him
here
are
seventeen
works
from
his
pen
of
which
one
his
philosophical
and
mineralogical
works
published
in
is
in
three
folio
volumes
these
productions
which
prove
the
incontestable
knowledge
of
swedenborg
were
given
to
me
by
monsieur
seraphitus
his
cousin
and
the
father
of
seraphita
in
continued
monsieur
becker
after
a
slight
pause
swedenborg
fell
into
a
state
of
absolute
silence
from
which
he
emerged
to
bid
farewell
to
all
his
earthly
occupations
after
which
his
thoughts
turned
exclusively
to
the
spiritual
life
he
received
the
first
commands
of
heaven
in
and
he
thus
relates
the
nature
of
the
vocation
to
which
he
was
called
one
evening
in
london
after
dining
with
a
great
appetite
a
thick
white
mist
seemed
to
fill
his
room
when
the
vapor
dispersed
a
creature
in
human
form
rose
from
one
corner
of
the
apartment
and
said
in
a
stern
tone
do
not
eat
so
he
refrained
the
next
night
the
same
man
returned
radiant
in
light
and
said
to
him
i
am
sent
of
god
who
has
chosen
you
to
explain
to
men
the
meaning
of
his
word
and
his
creation
i
will
tell
you
what
to
the
vision
lasted
but
a
few
moments
the
was
clothed
in
purple
during
that
night
the
eyes
of
his
were
opened
and
he
was
forced
to
look
into
the
heavens
into
the
world
of
spirits
and
into
hell
three
separate
spheres
where
he
encountered
persons
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
departed
from
their
human
form
some
long
since
others
lately
thenceforth
swedenborg
lived
wholly
in
the
spiritual
life
remaining
in
this
world
only
as
the
messenger
of
god
his
mission
was
ridiculed
by
the
incredulous
but
his
conduct
was
plainly
that
of
a
being
superior
to
humanity
in
the
first
place
though
limited
in
means
to
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
he
gave
away
enormous
sums
and
publicly
in
several
cities
restored
the
fortunes
of
great
commercial
houses
when
they
were
on
the
brink
of
failure
no
one
ever
appealed
to
his
generosity
who
was
not
immediately
satisfied
a
sceptical
englishman
determined
to
know
the
truth
followed
him
to
paris
and
relates
that
there
his
doors
stood
always
open
one
day
a
servant
complained
of
this
apparent
negligence
which
laid
him
open
to
suspicion
of
thefts
that
might
be
committed
by
others
he
need
feel
no
anxiety
said
swedenborg
smiling
but
i
do
not
wonder
at
his
fear
he
can
not
see
the
guardian
who
protects
my
in
fact
no
matter
in
what
country
he
made
his
abode
he
never
closed
his
doors
and
nothing
was
ever
stolen
from
him
at
gottenburg
a
town
situated
some
sixty
miles
from
stockholm
he
announced
eight
days
before
the
news
arrived
by
courier
the
conflagration
which
ravaged
stockholm
and
the
exact
time
at
which
it
took
place
the
queen
of
sweden
wrote
to
her
brother
the
king
at
berlin
that
one
of
her
who
was
ordered
by
the
courts
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
which
she
was
certain
her
husband
had
paid
before
his
death
went
to
swedenborg
and
begged
him
to
ask
her
husband
where
she
could
find
proof
of
the
payment
the
following
day
swedenborg
having
done
as
the
lady
requested
pointed
out
the
place
where
the
receipt
would
be
found
he
also
begged
the
deceased
to
appear
to
his
wife
and
the
latter
saw
her
husband
in
a
dream
wrapped
in
a
which
he
wore
just
before
his
death
and
he
showed
her
the
paper
in
the
place
indicated
by
swedenborg
where
it
had
been
securely
put
away
at
another
time
embarking
from
london
in
a
vessel
commanded
by
captain
dixon
he
overheard
a
lady
asking
if
there
were
plenty
of
provisions
on
board
we
do
not
want
a
great
quantity
he
said
in
eight
days
and
two
hours
we
shall
reach
stockholm
which
actually
happened
this
peculiar
state
of
vision
as
to
the
things
of
the
earth
into
which
swedenborg
could
put
himself
at
will
and
which
astonished
those
about
him
was
nevertheless
but
a
feeble
representative
of
his
faculty
of
looking
into
heaven
not
the
least
remarkable
of
his
published
visions
is
that
in
which
he
relates
his
journeys
through
the
astral
regions
his
descriptions
can
not
fail
to
astonish
the
reader
partly
through
the
crudity
of
their
details
a
man
whose
scientific
eminence
is
incontestable
and
who
united
in
his
own
person
powers
of
conception
will
and
imagination
would
surely
have
invented
better
if
he
had
invented
at
all
the
fantastic
literature
of
the
east
offers
nothing
that
can
give
an
idea
of
this
astounding
work
full
of
the
essence
of
poetry
if
it
is
permissible
to
compare
a
work
of
faith
with
one
of
oriental
fancy
the
transportation
of
swedenborg
by
the
angel
who
served
as
guide
to
this
first
journey
is
told
with
a
sublimity
which
exceeds
by
the
distance
which
god
has
placed
betwixt
the
earth
and
the
sun
the
great
epics
of
klopstock
milton
tasso
and
dante
this
description
which
serves
in
fact
as
an
introduction
to
his
work
on
the
astral
regions
has
never
been
published
it
is
among
the
oral
traditions
left
by
swedenborg
to
the
three
disciples
who
were
nearest
to
his
heart
monsieur
silverichm
has
written
them
down
monsieur
seraphitus
endeavored
more
than
once
to
talk
to
me
about
them
but
the
recollection
of
his
cousin
s
words
was
so
burning
a
memory
that
he
always
stopped
short
at
the
first
sentence
and
became
lost
in
a
revery
from
which
i
could
not
rouse
the
old
pastor
sighed
as
he
continued
the
baron
told
me
that
the
argument
by
which
the
angel
proved
to
swedenborg
that
these
bodies
are
not
made
to
wander
through
space
puts
all
human
science
out
of
sight
beneath
the
grandeur
of
a
divine
logic
according
to
the
seer
the
inhabitants
of
jupiter
will
not
cultivate
the
sciences
which
they
call
darkness
those
of
mercury
abhor
the
expression
of
ideas
by
speech
which
seems
to
them
too
material
their
language
is
ocular
those
of
saturn
are
continually
tempted
by
evil
spirits
those
of
the
moon
are
as
small
as
children
their
voices
issue
from
the
abdomen
on
which
they
crawl
those
of
venus
are
gigantic
in
height
but
stupid
and
live
by
robbery
although
a
part
of
this
latter
planet
is
inhabited
by
beings
of
great
sweetness
who
live
in
the
love
of
good
in
short
he
describes
the
customs
and
morals
of
all
the
peoples
attached
to
the
different
globes
and
explains
the
general
meaning
of
their
existence
as
related
to
the
universe
in
terms
so
precise
giving
explanations
which
agree
so
well
with
their
visible
evolutions
in
the
system
of
the
world
that
some
day
perhaps
scientific
men
will
come
to
drink
of
these
living
waters
here
said
monsieur
becker
taking
down
a
book
and
opening
it
at
a
mark
here
are
the
words
with
which
he
ended
this
work
if
any
man
doubts
that
i
was
transported
through
a
vast
number
of
astral
regions
let
him
recall
my
observation
of
the
distances
in
that
other
life
namely
that
they
exist
only
in
relation
to
the
external
state
of
man
now
being
transformed
within
like
unto
the
angelic
spirits
of
those
astral
spheres
i
was
able
to
understand
the
circumstances
to
which
we
of
this
canton
owe
the
presence
among
us
of
baron
seraphitus
the
beloved
cousin
of
swedenborg
enabled
me
to
know
all
the
events
of
the
extraordinary
life
of
that
prophet
he
has
lately
been
accused
of
imposture
in
certain
quarters
of
europe
and
the
public
prints
reported
the
following
fact
based
on
a
letter
written
by
the
chevalier
baylon
swedenborg
they
said
informed
by
certain
senators
of
a
secret
correspondence
of
the
late
queen
of
sweden
with
her
brother
the
prince
of
prussia
revealed
his
knowledge
of
the
secrets
contained
in
that
correspondence
to
the
queen
making
her
believe
he
had
obtained
this
knowledge
by
supernatural
means
a
man
worthy
of
all
confidence
monsieur
de
stahlhammer
captain
in
the
royal
guard
and
knight
of
the
sword
answered
the
calumny
with
a
convincing
the
pastor
opened
a
drawer
of
his
table
and
looked
through
a
number
of
papers
until
he
found
a
gazette
which
he
held
out
to
wilfrid
asking
him
to
read
aloud
the
following
letter
stockholm
may
i
have
read
with
amazement
a
letter
which
purports
to
relate
the
interview
of
the
famous
swedenborg
with
queen
the
circumstances
therein
stated
are
wholly
false
and
i
hope
the
writer
will
excuse
me
for
showing
him
by
the
following
faithful
narration
which
can
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
many
distinguished
persons
then
present
and
still
living
how
completely
he
has
been
deceived
in
shortly
after
the
death
of
the
prince
of
prussia
swedenborg
came
to
court
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
attending
regularly
he
had
scarcely
entered
the
queen
s
presence
before
she
said
to
him
well
assessor
have
you
seen
my
brother
swedenborg
answered
no
and
the
queen
rejoined
if
you
do
see
him
greet
him
for
in
saying
this
she
meant
no
more
than
a
pleasant
jest
and
had
no
thought
whatever
of
asking
him
for
information
about
her
brother
eight
days
later
not
as
stated
nor
was
the
audience
a
private
one
swedenborg
again
came
to
court
but
so
early
that
the
queen
had
not
left
her
apartment
called
the
white
room
where
she
was
conversing
with
her
and
other
ladies
attached
to
the
court
swedenborg
did
not
wait
until
she
came
forth
but
entered
the
said
room
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
the
queen
overcome
with
amazement
was
taken
ill
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
recovered
herself
when
she
did
so
she
said
to
those
about
her
only
god
and
my
brother
knew
the
thing
that
he
has
just
spoken
she
admitted
that
it
related
to
her
last
correspondence
with
the
prince
on
a
subject
which
was
known
to
them
alone
i
can
not
explain
how
swedenborg
came
to
know
the
contents
of
that
letter
but
i
can
affirm
on
my
honor
that
neither
count
h
as
the
writer
of
the
article
states
nor
any
other
person
intercepted
or
read
the
queen
s
letters
the
senate
allowed
her
to
write
to
her
brother
in
perfect
security
considering
the
correspondence
as
of
no
interest
to
the
state
it
is
evident
that
the
author
of
the
said
article
is
ignorant
of
the
character
of
count
h
this
honored
gentleman
who
has
done
many
important
services
to
his
country
unites
the
qualities
of
a
noble
heart
to
gifts
of
mind
and
his
great
age
has
not
yet
weakened
these
precious
possessions
during
his
whole
administration
he
added
the
weight
of
scrupulous
integrity
to
his
enlightened
policy
and
openly
declared
himself
the
enemy
of
all
secret
intrigues
and
underhand
dealings
which
he
regarded
as
unworthy
means
to
attain
an
end
neither
did
the
writer
of
that
article
understand
the
assessor
swedenborg
the
only
weakness
of
that
essentially
honest
man
was
a
belief
in
the
apparition
of
spirits
but
i
knew
him
for
many
years
and
i
can
affirm
that
he
was
as
fully
convinced
that
he
met
and
talked
with
spirits
as
i
am
that
i
am
writing
at
this
moment
as
a
citizen
and
as
a
friend
his
integrity
was
absolute
he
abhorred
deception
and
led
the
most
exemplary
of
lives
the
version
which
the
chevalier
baylon
gave
of
these
facts
is
therefore
entirely
without
justification
the
visit
stated
to
have
been
made
to
swedenborg
in
the
by
count
h
and
count
t
is
hereby
contradicted
in
conclusion
the
writer
of
the
letter
may
rest
assured
that
i
am
not
a
follower
of
swedenborg
the
love
of
truth
alone
impels
me
to
give
this
faithful
account
of
a
fact
which
has
been
so
often
stated
with
details
that
are
entirely
false
i
certify
to
the
truth
of
what
i
have
written
by
adding
my
signature
de
stahlhammer
the
proofs
which
swedenborg
gave
of
his
mission
to
the
royal
families
of
sweden
and
prussia
were
no
doubt
the
foundation
of
the
belief
in
his
doctrines
which
is
prevalent
at
the
two
courts
said
monsieur
becker
putting
the
gazette
into
the
drawer
however
he
continued
i
shall
not
tell
you
all
the
facts
of
his
visible
and
material
life
indeed
his
habits
prevented
them
from
being
fully
known
he
lived
a
hidden
life
not
seeking
either
riches
or
fame
he
was
even
noted
for
a
sort
of
repugnance
to
making
proselytes
he
opened
his
mind
to
few
persons
and
never
showed
his
external
powers
of
to
any
who
were
not
eminent
in
faith
wisdom
and
love
he
could
recognize
at
a
glance
the
state
of
the
soul
of
every
person
who
approached
him
and
those
whom
he
desired
to
reach
with
his
inward
language
he
converted
into
seers
after
the
year
his
disciples
never
saw
him
do
a
single
thing
from
any
human
motive
one
man
alone
a
swedish
priest
named
mathesius
set
afloat
a
story
that
he
went
mad
in
london
in
but
a
eulogium
on
swedenborg
prepared
with
minute
care
as
to
all
the
known
events
of
his
life
was
pronounced
after
his
death
in
on
behalf
of
the
royal
academy
of
sciences
in
the
hall
of
the
nobles
at
stockholm
by
monsieur
sandels
counsellor
of
the
board
of
mines
a
declaration
made
before
the
lord
mayor
of
london
gives
the
details
of
his
last
illness
and
death
in
which
he
received
the
ministrations
of
monsieur
ferelius
a
swedish
priest
of
the
highest
standing
and
pastor
of
the
swedish
church
in
london
mathesius
being
his
assistant
all
persons
present
attested
that
so
far
from
denying
the
value
of
his
writings
swedenborg
firmly
asserted
their
truth
in
one
hundred
years
monsieur
ferelius
quotes
him
as
saying
my
doctrine
will
guide
the
he
predicted
the
day
and
hour
of
his
death
on
that
day
sunday
march
hearing
the
clock
strike
he
asked
what
time
it
was
five
o
clock
was
the
answer
it
is
well
he
answered
thank
you
god
bless
ten
minutes
later
he
tranquilly
departed
breathing
a
gentle
sigh
simplicity
moderation
and
solitude
were
the
features
of
his
life
when
he
had
finished
writing
any
of
his
books
he
sailed
either
for
london
or
for
holland
where
he
published
them
and
never
spoke
of
them
again
he
published
in
this
way
different
treatises
all
written
he
said
from
the
dictation
of
angels
be
it
true
or
false
few
men
have
been
strong
enough
to
endure
the
flames
of
oral
illumination
there
they
all
are
said
monsieur
becker
pointing
to
a
second
shelf
on
which
were
some
sixty
volumes
the
treatises
on
which
the
divine
spirit
casts
its
most
vivid
gleams
are
seven
in
number
namely
heaven
and
hell
angelic
wisdom
concerning
the
divine
love
and
the
divine
wisdom
angelic
wisdom
concerning
the
divine
providence
the
apocalypse
revealed
conjugial
love
and
its
chaste
delights
the
true
christian
religion
and
an
exposition
of
the
internal
swedenborg
s
explanation
of
the
apocalypse
begins
with
these
words
said
monsieur
becker
taking
down
and
opening
the
volume
nearest
to
him
herein
i
have
written
nothing
of
mine
own
i
speak
as
i
am
bidden
by
the
lord
who
said
through
the
same
angel
to
john
thou
shalt
not
seal
the
sayings
of
this
revelation
xxii
my
dear
monsieur
wilfrid
said
the
old
man
looking
at
his
guest
i
often
tremble
in
every
limb
as
i
read
during
the
long
winter
evenings
the
works
in
which
this
man
declares
with
perfect
artlessness
the
wonders
that
are
revealed
to
him
i
have
seen
he
says
heaven
and
the
angels
the
spiritual
man
sees
his
spiritual
fellows
far
better
than
the
terrestrial
man
sees
the
men
of
earth
in
describing
the
wonders
of
heaven
and
beneath
the
heavens
i
obey
the
lord
s
command
others
have
the
right
to
believe
me
or
not
as
they
choose
i
can
not
put
them
into
the
state
in
which
god
has
put
me
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
enable
them
to
converse
with
angels
nor
to
work
miracles
within
their
understanding
they
alone
can
be
the
instrument
of
their
rise
to
angelic
intercourse
it
is
now
years
since
i
have
lived
in
the
spiritual
world
with
angels
and
on
earth
with
men
for
it
pleased
god
to
open
the
eyes
of
my
spirit
as
he
did
that
of
paul
and
of
daniel
and
and
yet
continued
the
pastor
thoughtfully
certain
persons
have
had
visions
of
the
spiritual
world
through
the
complete
detachment
which
somnambulism
produces
between
their
external
form
and
their
inner
being
in
this
state
says
swedenborg
in
his
treatise
on
angelic
wisdom
no
man
may
rise
into
the
region
of
celestial
light
because
his
corporeal
senses
being
abolished
the
influence
of
heaven
acts
without
hindrance
on
his
inner
many
persons
who
do
not
doubt
that
swedenborg
received
celestial
revelations
think
that
his
writings
are
not
all
the
result
of
divine
inspiration
others
insist
on
absolute
adherence
to
him
while
admitting
his
many
obscurities
they
believe
that
the
imperfection
of
earthly
language
prevented
the
prophet
from
clearly
revealing
those
spiritual
visions
whose
clouds
disperse
to
the
eyes
of
those
whom
faith
regenerates
for
to
use
the
words
of
his
greatest
disciple
flesh
is
but
an
external
to
poets
and
to
writers
his
presentation
of
the
marvellous
is
amazing
to
seers
it
is
simply
reality
to
some
christians
his
descriptions
have
seemed
scandalous
certain
critics
have
ridiculed
the
celestial
substance
of
his
temples
his
golden
palaces
his
splendid
cities
where
angels
disport
themselves
they
laugh
at
his
groves
of
miraculous
trees
his
gardens
where
the
flowers
speak
and
the
air
is
white
and
the
mystical
stones
the
sard
carbuncle
chrysolite
chrysoprase
jacinth
chalcedony
beryl
the
urim
and
thummim
are
endowed
with
motion
express
celestial
truths
and
reply
by
variations
of
light
to
questions
put
to
them
true
christian
religion
many
noble
souls
will
not
admit
his
spiritual
worlds
where
colors
are
heard
in
delightful
concert
where
language
flames
and
flashes
where
the
word
is
writ
in
pointed
spiral
letters
true
christian
religion
even
in
the
north
some
writers
have
laughed
at
the
gates
of
pearl
and
the
diamonds
which
stud
the
floors
and
walls
of
his
new
jerusalem
where
the
most
ordinary
utensils
are
made
of
the
rarest
substances
of
the
globe
but
say
his
disciples
because
such
things
are
sparsely
scattered
on
this
earth
does
it
follow
that
they
are
not
abundant
in
other
worlds
on
earth
they
are
terrestrial
substances
whereas
in
heaven
they
assume
celestial
forms
and
are
in
keeping
with
in
this
connection
swedenborg
has
used
the
very
words
of
jesus
christ
who
said
if
i
have
told
you
earthly
things
and
ye
believe
not
how
shall
ye
believe
if
i
tell
you
of
heavenly
things
monsieur
continued
the
pastor
with
an
emphatic
gesture
i
have
read
the
whole
of
swedenborg
s
works
and
i
say
it
with
pride
because
i
have
done
it
and
yet
retained
my
reason
in
reading
him
men
either
miss
his
meaning
or
become
seers
like
him
though
i
have
evaded
both
extremes
i
have
often
experienced
delights
deep
emotions
inward
joys
which
alone
can
reveal
to
us
the
plenitude
of
truth
the
evidence
of
celestial
light
all
things
here
below
seem
small
indeed
when
the
soul
is
lost
in
the
perusal
of
these
treatises
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
amazed
when
we
think
that
in
the
short
space
of
thirty
years
this
man
wrote
and
published
on
the
truths
of
the
spiritual
world
quarto
volumes
composed
in
latin
of
which
the
shortest
has
five
hundred
pages
all
of
them
printed
in
small
type
he
left
they
say
twenty
others
in
london
bequeathed
to
his
nephew
monsieur
silverichm
formerly
almoner
to
the
king
of
sweden
certainly
a
man
who
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
sixty
had
already
exhausted
himself
in
publishing
a
series
of
encyclopaedical
works
must
have
received
supernatural
assistance
in
composing
these
later
stupendous
treatises
at
an
age
too
when
human
vigor
is
on
the
wane
you
will
find
in
these
writings
thousands
of
propositions
all
numbered
none
of
which
have
been
refuted
throughout
we
see
method
and
precision
the
presence
of
the
spirit
issuing
and
flowing
down
from
a
single
fact
the
existence
of
angels
his
true
christian
religion
which
sums
up
his
whole
doctrine
and
is
vigorous
with
light
was
conceived
and
written
at
the
age
of
in
fact
his
amazing
vigor
and
omniscience
are
not
denied
by
any
of
his
critics
not
even
by
his
enemies
nevertheless
said
monsieur
becker
slowly
though
i
have
drunk
deep
in
this
torrent
of
divine
light
god
has
not
opened
the
eyes
of
my
inner
being
and
i
judge
these
writings
by
the
reason
of
an
unregenerated
man
i
have
often
felt
that
the
swedenborg
must
have
misunderstood
the
angels
i
have
laughed
over
certain
visions
which
according
to
his
disciples
i
ought
to
have
believed
with
veneration
i
have
failed
to
imagine
the
spiral
writing
of
the
angels
or
their
golden
belts
on
which
the
gold
is
of
great
or
lesser
thickness
if
for
example
this
statement
some
angels
are
solitary
affected
me
powerfully
for
a
time
i
was
on
reflection
unable
to
reconcile
this
solitude
with
their
marriages
i
have
not
understood
why
the
virgin
mary
should
continue
to
wear
blue
satin
garments
in
heaven
i
have
even
dared
to
ask
myself
why
those
gigantic
demons
enakim
and
hephilim
came
so
frequently
to
fight
the
cherubim
on
the
apocalyptic
plains
of
armageddon
and
i
can
not
explain
to
my
own
mind
how
satans
can
argue
with
angels
monsieur
le
baron
seraphitus
assured
me
that
those
details
concerned
only
the
angels
who
live
on
earth
in
human
form
the
visions
of
the
prophet
are
often
blurred
with
grotesque
figures
one
of
his
spiritual
tales
or
memorable
relations
as
he
called
them
begins
thus
i
see
the
spirits
assembling
they
have
hats
upon
their
in
another
of
these
memorabilia
he
receives
from
heaven
a
bit
of
paper
on
which
he
saw
he
says
the
hieroglyphics
of
the
primitive
peoples
which
were
composed
of
curved
lines
traced
from
the
that
are
worn
in
heaven
however
perhaps
i
am
wrong
possibly
the
material
absurdities
with
which
his
works
are
strewn
have
spiritual
significations
otherwise
how
shall
we
account
for
the
growing
influence
of
his
religion
his
church
numbers
more
than
seven
hundred
thousand
believers
as
many
in
the
united
states
of
america
as
in
england
where
there
are
seven
thousand
swedenborgians
in
the
city
of
manchester
alone
many
men
of
high
rank
in
knowledge
and
in
social
position
in
germany
in
prussia
and
in
the
northern
kingdoms
have
publicly
adopted
the
beliefs
of
swedenborg
which
i
may
remark
are
more
comforting
than
those
of
all
other
christian
communions
i
wish
i
had
the
power
to
explain
to
you
clearly
in
succinct
language
the
leading
points
of
the
doctrine
on
which
swedenborg
founded
his
church
but
i
fear
such
a
summary
made
from
recollection
would
be
necessarily
defective
i
shall
therefore
allow
myself
to
speak
only
of
those
arcana
which
concern
the
birth
of
here
monsieur
becker
paused
as
though
composing
his
mind
to
gather
up
his
ideas
presently
he
continued
as
follows
after
establishing
mathematically
that
man
lives
eternally
in
spheres
of
either
a
lower
or
a
higher
grade
swedenborg
applies
the
term
spiritual
angels
to
beings
who
in
this
world
are
prepared
for
heaven
where
they
become
angels
according
to
him
god
has
not
created
angels
none
exist
who
have
not
been
men
upon
the
earth
the
earth
is
the
of
heaven
the
angels
are
therefore
not
angels
as
such
angelic
wisdom
they
are
transformed
through
their
close
conjunction
with
god
which
conjunction
god
never
refuses
because
the
essence
of
god
is
not
negative
but
essentially
active
the
spiritual
angels
pass
through
three
natures
of
love
because
man
is
only
regenerated
through
successive
stages
true
religion
first
the
of
the
supreme
expression
of
this
love
is
human
genius
whose
works
are
worshipped
next
of
this
love
produces
prophets
great
men
whom
the
world
accepts
as
guides
and
proclaims
to
be
divine
lastly
of
and
this
creates
the
spiritual
angel
these
angels
are
so
to
speak
the
flowers
of
humanity
which
culminates
in
them
and
works
for
that
culmination
they
must
possess
either
the
love
of
heaven
or
the
wisdom
of
heaven
but
always
love
before
wisdom
thus
the
transformation
of
the
natural
man
is
into
love
to
reach
this
first
degree
his
previous
existences
must
have
passed
through
hope
and
charity
which
prepare
him
for
faith
and
prayer
the
ideas
acquired
by
the
exercise
of
these
virtues
are
transmitted
to
each
of
the
human
envelopes
within
which
are
hidden
the
metamorphoses
of
the
for
nothing
is
separate
each
existence
is
necessary
to
the
other
existences
hope
can
not
advance
without
charity
nor
faith
without
prayer
they
are
the
four
fronts
of
a
solid
square
one
virtue
missing
he
said
and
the
spiritual
angel
is
like
a
broken
each
of
these
existences
is
therefore
a
circle
in
which
revolves
the
celestial
riches
of
the
inner
being
the
perfection
of
the
spiritual
angels
comes
from
this
mysterious
progression
in
which
nothing
is
lost
of
the
high
qualities
that
are
successfully
acquired
to
attain
each
glorious
incarnation
for
at
each
transformation
they
cast
away
unconsciously
the
flesh
and
its
errors
when
the
man
lives
in
love
he
has
shed
all
evil
passions
hope
charity
faith
and
prayer
have
in
the
words
of
isaiah
purged
the
dross
of
his
inner
being
which
can
never
more
be
polluted
by
earthly
affections
hence
the
grand
saying
of
christ
quoted
by
saint
matthew
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
and
those
still
grander
words
if
ye
were
of
this
world
the
world
would
love
you
but
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
the
world
be
ye
therefore
perfect
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
the
second
transformation
of
man
is
to
wisdom
wisdom
is
the
understanding
of
celestial
things
to
which
the
spirit
is
brought
by
love
the
spirit
of
love
has
acquired
strength
the
result
of
all
vanquished
terrestrial
passions
it
loves
god
blindly
but
the
spirit
of
wisdom
has
risen
to
understanding
and
knows
why
it
loves
the
wings
of
the
one
are
spread
and
bear
the
spirit
to
god
the
wings
of
the
other
are
held
down
by
the
awe
that
comes
of
understanding
the
spirit
knows
god
the
one
longs
incessantly
to
see
god
and
to
fly
to
him
the
other
attains
to
him
and
trembles
the
union
effected
between
the
spirit
of
love
and
the
spirit
of
wisdom
carries
the
human
being
into
a
divine
state
during
which
time
his
soul
is
and
his
body
the
last
human
manifestation
in
which
the
spirit
conquers
form
or
form
still
struggles
against
the
spirit
for
form
that
is
the
flesh
is
ignorant
rebels
and
desires
to
continue
gross
this
supreme
trial
creates
untold
sufferings
seen
by
heaven
alone
the
agony
of
christ
in
the
garden
of
olives
after
death
the
first
heaven
opens
to
this
dual
and
purified
human
nature
therefore
it
is
that
man
dies
in
despair
while
the
spirit
dies
in
ecstasy
thus
the
the
state
of
beings
not
yet
regenerated
the
the
state
of
those
who
have
become
angelic
spirits
and
the
the
state
in
which
the
angel
exists
before
he
breaks
from
his
covering
of
flesh
are
the
three
degrees
of
existence
through
which
man
enters
heaven
one
of
swedenborg
s
thoughts
expressed
in
his
own
words
will
explain
to
you
with
wonderful
clearness
the
difference
between
the
and
the
to
the
minds
of
men
he
says
the
natural
passes
into
the
spiritual
they
regard
the
world
under
its
visible
aspects
they
perceive
it
only
as
it
can
be
realized
by
their
senses
but
to
the
apprehension
of
angelic
spirits
the
spiritual
passes
into
the
natural
they
regard
the
world
in
its
inward
essence
and
not
in
its
thus
human
sciences
are
but
analyses
of
form
the
man
of
science
as
the
world
goes
is
purely
external
like
his
knowledge
his
inner
being
is
only
used
to
preserve
his
aptitude
for
the
perception
of
external
truths
the
angelic
spirit
goes
far
beyond
that
his
knowledge
is
the
thought
of
which
human
science
is
but
the
utterance
he
derives
that
knowledge
from
the
logos
and
learns
the
law
of
by
which
the
world
is
placed
in
unison
with
heaven
the
of
was
wholly
written
by
pure
correspondences
and
covers
an
esoteric
or
spiritual
meaning
which
according
to
the
science
of
correspondences
can
not
be
understood
there
exist
says
swedenborg
celestial
doctrine
innumerable
arcana
within
the
hidden
meaning
of
the
correspondences
thus
the
men
who
scoff
at
the
books
of
the
prophets
where
the
word
is
enshrined
are
as
densely
ignorant
as
those
other
men
who
know
nothing
of
a
science
and
yet
ridicule
its
truths
to
know
the
correspondences
which
exist
between
the
things
visible
and
ponderable
in
the
terrestrial
world
and
the
things
invisible
and
imponderable
in
the
spiritual
world
is
to
hold
heaven
within
our
comprehension
all
the
objects
of
the
manifold
creations
having
emanated
from
god
necessarily
enfold
a
hidden
meaning
according
indeed
to
the
grand
thought
of
isaiah
the
earth
is
a
this
mysterious
link
between
heaven
and
the
smallest
atoms
of
created
matter
constitutes
what
swedenborg
calls
a
celestial
arcanum
and
his
treatise
on
the
celestial
arcana
in
which
he
explains
the
correspondences
or
significances
of
the
natural
with
and
to
the
spiritual
giving
to
use
the
words
of
jacob
boehm
the
sign
and
seal
of
all
things
occupies
not
less
than
sixteen
volumes
containing
thirty
thousand
propositions
this
marvellous
knowledge
of
correspondences
which
the
goodness
of
god
granted
to
swedenborg
says
one
of
his
disciples
is
the
secret
of
the
interest
which
draws
men
to
his
works
according
to
him
all
things
are
derived
from
heaven
all
things
lead
back
to
heaven
his
writings
are
sublime
and
clear
he
speaks
in
heaven
and
earth
hears
him
take
one
of
his
sentences
by
itself
and
a
volume
could
be
made
of
it
and
the
disciple
quotes
the
following
passages
taken
from
a
thousand
others
that
would
answer
the
same
purpose
the
kingdom
of
heaven
says
swedenborg
celestial
arcana
is
the
kingdom
of
motives
is
born
in
heaven
thence
into
the
world
and
by
degrees
to
the
infinitely
remote
parts
of
earth
terrestrial
effects
being
thus
linked
to
celestial
causes
all
things
are
and
man
is
the
means
of
union
between
the
natural
and
the
the
angelic
spirits
therefore
know
the
very
nature
of
the
correspondences
which
link
to
heaven
all
earthly
things
they
know
too
the
inner
meaning
of
the
prophetic
words
which
foretell
their
evolutions
thus
to
these
spirits
everything
here
below
has
its
significance
the
tiniest
flower
is
a
thought
a
life
which
corresponds
to
certain
lineaments
of
the
great
whole
of
which
they
have
a
constant
intuition
to
them
adultery
and
the
excesses
spoken
of
in
scripture
and
by
the
prophets
often
garbled
by
scholars
mean
the
state
of
those
souls
which
in
this
world
persist
in
tainting
themselves
with
earthly
affections
thus
compelling
their
divorce
from
heaven
clouds
signify
the
veil
of
the
most
high
torches
horses
and
horsemen
harlots
precious
stones
in
short
everything
named
in
scripture
has
to
them
a
meaning
and
reveals
the
future
of
terrestrial
facts
in
their
relation
to
heaven
they
penetrate
the
truths
contained
in
the
revelation
of
saint
john
the
divine
which
human
science
has
subsequently
demonstrated
and
proved
materially
such
for
instance
as
the
following
big
said
swedenborg
with
many
human
sciences
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
revelation
xxi
these
spirits
know
the
supper
at
which
the
flesh
of
kings
and
the
flesh
of
all
men
free
and
bond
is
eaten
to
which
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
has
bidden
them
they
see
the
winged
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
mailed
man
the
horse
of
the
apocalypse
says
swedenborg
is
the
visible
image
of
human
intellect
ridden
by
death
for
it
bears
within
itself
the
elements
of
its
own
moreover
they
can
distinguish
beings
concealed
under
forms
which
to
ignorant
eyes
would
seem
fantastic
when
a
man
is
disposed
to
receive
the
prophetic
afflation
of
correspondences
it
rouses
within
him
a
perception
of
the
word
he
comprehends
that
the
creations
are
transformations
only
his
intellect
is
sharpened
a
burning
thirst
takes
possession
of
him
which
only
heaven
can
quench
he
conceives
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
perfection
of
his
inner
being
the
power
of
the
angelic
spirits
and
he
advances
led
by
desire
the
least
imperfect
state
of
unregenerated
man
towards
hope
the
gateway
to
the
world
of
spirits
whence
he
reaches
prayer
which
gives
him
the
key
of
heaven
what
being
here
below
would
not
desire
to
render
himself
worthy
of
entrance
into
the
sphere
of
those
who
live
in
secret
by
love
and
wisdom
here
on
earth
during
their
lifetime
such
spirits
remain
pure
they
neither
see
nor
think
nor
speak
like
other
men
there
are
two
ways
by
which
perception
comes
one
internal
the
other
external
man
is
wholly
external
the
angelic
spirit
wholly
internal
the
spirit
goes
to
the
depth
of
numbers
possesses
a
full
sense
of
them
knows
their
significances
it
controls
motion
and
by
reason
of
its
ubiquity
it
shares
in
all
things
an
angel
says
swedenborg
is
ever
present
to
a
man
when
desired
angelic
wisdom
for
the
angel
has
the
gift
of
detaching
himself
from
his
body
and
he
sees
into
heaven
as
the
prophets
and
as
swedenborg
himself
saw
into
it
in
this
state
writes
swedenborg
true
religion
the
spirit
of
a
man
may
move
from
one
place
to
another
his
body
remaining
where
it
is
a
condition
in
which
i
lived
for
over
it
is
thus
that
we
should
interpret
all
biblical
statements
which
begin
the
spirit
led
angelic
wisdom
is
to
human
wisdom
what
the
innumerable
forces
of
nature
are
to
its
action
which
is
one
all
things
live
again
and
move
and
have
their
being
in
the
spirit
which
is
in
god
saint
paul
expresses
this
truth
when
he
says
in
deo
sumus
movemur
et
vivimus
we
live
we
act
we
are
in
god
earth
offers
no
hindrance
to
the
angelic
spirit
just
as
the
word
offers
him
no
obscurity
his
approaching
divinity
enables
him
to
see
the
thought
of
god
veiled
in
the
logos
just
as
living
by
his
inner
being
the
spirit
is
in
communion
with
the
hidden
meaning
of
all
things
on
this
earth
science
is
the
language
of
the
temporal
world
love
is
that
of
the
spiritual
world
thus
man
takes
note
of
more
than
he
is
able
to
explain
while
the
angelic
spirit
sees
and
comprehends
science
depresses
man
love
exalts
the
angel
science
is
still
seeking
love
has
found
man
judges
nature
according
to
his
own
relations
to
her
the
angelic
spirit
judges
it
in
its
relation
to
heaven
in
short
all
things
have
a
voice
for
the
spirit
spirits
are
in
the
secret
of
the
harmony
of
all
creations
with
each
other
they
comprehend
the
spirit
of
sound
the
spirit
of
color
the
spirit
of
vegetable
life
they
can
question
the
mineral
and
the
mineral
makes
answer
to
their
thoughts
what
to
them
are
sciences
and
the
treasures
of
the
earth
when
they
grasp
all
things
by
the
eye
at
all
moments
when
the
worlds
which
absorb
the
minds
of
so
many
men
are
to
them
but
the
last
step
from
which
they
spring
to
god
love
of
heaven
or
the
wisdom
of
heaven
is
made
manifest
to
them
by
a
circle
of
light
which
surrounds
them
and
is
visible
to
the
elect
their
innocence
of
which
that
of
children
is
a
symbol
possesses
nevertheless
a
knowledge
which
children
have
not
they
are
both
innocent
and
learned
and
says
swedenborg
the
innocence
of
heaven
makes
such
an
impression
upon
the
soul
that
those
whom
it
affects
keep
a
rapturous
memory
of
it
which
lasts
them
all
their
lives
as
i
myself
have
experienced
it
is
perhaps
sufficient
he
goes
on
to
have
only
a
minimum
perception
of
it
to
be
forever
changed
to
long
to
enter
heaven
and
the
sphere
of
his
doctrine
of
marriage
can
be
reduced
to
the
following
words
the
lord
has
taken
the
beauty
and
the
grace
of
the
life
of
man
and
bestowed
them
upon
woman
when
man
is
not
reunited
to
this
beauty
and
this
grace
of
his
life
he
is
harsh
sad
and
sullen
when
he
is
reunited
to
them
he
is
joyful
and
the
angels
are
ever
at
the
perfect
point
of
beauty
marriages
are
celebrated
by
wondrous
ceremonies
in
these
unions
which
produce
no
children
man
contributes
the
woman
the
they
become
one
being
one
flesh
here
below
and
pass
to
heaven
clothed
in
the
celestial
form
on
this
earth
the
natural
attraction
of
the
sexes
towards
enjoyment
is
an
effect
which
allures
fatigues
and
disgusts
but
in
the
form
celestial
the
pair
now
in
spirit
find
within
theirself
a
ceaseless
source
of
joy
swedenborg
was
led
to
see
these
nuptials
of
the
spirits
which
in
the
words
of
saint
luke
xx
are
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
and
which
inspire
none
but
spiritual
pleasures
an
angel
offered
to
make
him
witness
of
such
a
marriage
and
bore
him
thither
on
his
wings
the
wings
are
a
symbol
and
not
a
reality
the
angel
clothed
him
in
a
wedding
garment
and
when
swedenborg
finding
himself
thus
robed
in
light
asked
why
the
answer
was
for
these
events
our
garments
are
illuminated
they
shine
they
are
made
conjugial
love
then
he
saw
the
two
angels
one
coming
from
the
south
the
other
from
the
east
the
angel
of
the
south
was
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
two
white
horses
with
reins
of
the
color
and
brilliance
of
the
dawn
but
lo
when
they
were
near
him
in
the
sky
chariot
and
horses
vanished
the
angel
of
the
east
clothed
in
crimson
and
the
angel
of
the
south
in
purple
drew
together
like
breaths
and
mingled
one
was
the
angel
of
love
the
other
the
angel
of
wisdom
swedenborg
s
guide
told
him
that
the
two
angels
had
been
linked
together
on
earth
by
an
inward
friendship
and
ever
united
though
separated
in
life
by
great
distances
consent
the
essence
of
all
good
marriage
upon
earth
is
the
habitual
state
of
angels
in
heaven
love
is
the
light
of
their
world
the
eternal
rapture
of
angels
comes
from
the
faculty
that
god
communicates
to
them
to
render
back
to
him
the
joy
they
feel
through
him
this
reciprocity
of
infinitude
forms
their
life
they
become
infinite
by
participating
of
the
essence
of
god
who
generates
himself
by
himself
the
immensity
of
the
heavens
where
the
angels
dwell
is
such
that
if
man
were
endowed
with
sight
as
rapid
as
the
darting
of
light
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
and
if
he
gazed
throughout
eternity
his
eyes
could
not
reach
the
horizon
nor
find
an
end
light
alone
can
give
an
idea
of
the
joys
of
heaven
it
is
says
swedenborg
angelic
wisdom
a
vapor
of
the
virtue
of
god
a
pure
emanation
of
his
splendor
beside
which
our
greatest
brilliance
is
obscurity
it
can
compass
all
it
can
renew
all
and
is
never
absorbed
it
environs
the
angel
and
unites
him
to
god
by
infinite
joys
which
multiply
infinitely
of
themselves
this
light
destroys
whosoever
is
not
prepared
to
receive
it
no
one
here
below
nor
yet
in
heaven
can
see
god
and
live
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
saying
exodus
xix
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
ye
go
not
up
into
the
mount
lest
ye
break
through
unto
the
lord
to
gaze
and
many
and
again
exodus
xxxiv
when
moses
came
down
from
mount
sinai
with
the
two
tables
of
testimony
in
his
hand
his
face
shone
so
that
he
put
a
veil
upon
it
when
he
spake
with
the
people
lest
any
of
them
the
transfiguration
of
jesus
christ
likewise
revealed
the
light
surrounding
the
messengers
from
on
high
and
the
ineffable
joys
of
the
angels
who
are
forever
imbued
with
it
his
face
says
saint
matthew
xvii
did
shine
as
the
sun
and
his
raiment
was
white
as
the
light
and
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
when
a
planet
contains
only
those
beings
who
reject
the
lord
when
his
word
is
ignored
then
the
angelic
spirits
are
gathered
together
by
the
four
winds
and
god
sends
forth
an
exterminating
angel
to
change
the
face
of
the
refractory
earth
which
in
the
immensity
of
this
universe
is
to
him
what
an
unfruitful

the

monsieur
said
to
me
when
i
met
him
during
a
journey
which
he
made
in
sweden
surely
this
is
the
one
most
worthy
of
but
monsieur
continued
the
pastor
after
a
thoughtful
pause
of
what
avail
to
you
are
these
shreds
of
thoughts
taken
here
and
there
from
the
vast
extent
of
a
work
of
which
no
true
idea
can
be
given
except
by
comparing
it
to
a
river
of
light
to
billows
of
flame
when
a
man
plunges
into
it
he
is
carried
away
as
by
an
awful
current
dante
s
poem
seems
but
a
speck
to
the
reader
submerged
in
the
almost
biblical
verses
with
which
swedenborg
renders
palpable
the
celestial
worlds
as
beethoven
built
his
palaces
of
harmony
with
thousands
of
notes
as
architects
have
reared
cathedrals
with
millions
of
stones
we
roll
in
soundless
depths
where
our
minds
will
not
always
sustain
us
ah
surely
a
great
and
powerful
intellect
is
needed
to
bring
us
back
safe
and
sound
to
our
own
social
beliefs
swedenborg
resumed
the
pastor
was
particularly
attached
to
the
baron
de
seraphitz
whose
name
according
to
an
old
swedish
custom
had
taken
from
time
immemorial
the
latin
termination
of
the
baron
was
an
ardent
disciple
of
the
swedish
prophet
who
had
opened
the
eyes
of
his
and
brought
him
to
a
life
in
conformity
with
the
decrees
from
he
sought
for
an
angelic
spirit
among
women
swedenborg
found
her
for
him
in
a
vision
his
bride
was
the
daughter
of
a
london
shoemaker
in
whom
said
swedenborg
the
life
of
heaven
shone
she
having
passed
through
all
anterior
trials
after
the
death
that
is
the
transformation
of
the
prophet
the
baron
came
to
jarvis
to
accomplish
his
celestial
nuptials
with
the
observances
of
prayer
as
for
me
who
am
not
a
seer
i
have
only
known
the
terrestrial
works
of
this
couple
their
lives
were
those
of
saints
whose
virtues
are
the
glory
of
the
roman
church
they
ameliorated
the
condition
of
our
people
they
supplied
them
all
with
means
in
return
for
work
little
perhaps
but
enough
for
all
their
wants
those
who
lived
with
them
in
constant
intercourse
never
saw
them
show
a
sign
of
anger
or
impatience
they
were
constantly
beneficent
and
gentle
full
of
courtesy
and
their
marriage
was
the
harmony
of
two
souls
indissolubly
united
two
eiders
winging
the
same
flight
the
sound
in
the
echo
the
thought
in
the
word
these
perhaps
are
true
images
of
their
union
every
one
here
in
jarvis
loved
them
with
an
affection
which
i
can
compare
only
to
the
love
of
a
plant
for
the
sun
the
wife
was
simple
in
her
manners
beautiful
in
form
lovely
in
face
with
a
dignity
of
bearing
like
that
of
august
personages
in
being
then
years
old
she
conceived
a
child
her
pregnancy
was
to
the
pair
a
solemn
joy
they
prepared
to
bid
the
earth
farewell
for
they
told
me
they
should
be
transformed
when
their
child
had
passed
the
state
of
infancy
which
needed
their
fostering
care
until
the
strength
to
exist
alone
should
be
given
to
her
their
child
was
born
the
seraphita
we
are
now
concerned
with
from
the
moment
of
her
conception
father
and
mother
lived
a
still
more
solitary
life
than
in
the
past
lifting
themselves
up
to
heaven
by
prayer
they
hoped
to
see
swedenborg
and
faith
realized
their
hope
the
day
on
which
seraphita
came
into
the
world
swedenborg
appeared
in
jarvis
and
filled
the
room
of
the
child
with
light
i
was
told
that
he
said
the
work
is
accomplished
the
heavens
rejoice
sounds
of
unknown
melodies
were
heard
throughout
the
house
seeming
to
come
from
the
four
points
of
heaven
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
the
spirit
of
swedenborg
led
the
father
forth
to
the
shores
of
the
fiord
and
there
quitted
him
certain
inhabitants
of
jarvis
having
approached
monsieur
seraphitus
as
he
stood
on
the
shore
heard
him
repeat
those
blissful
words
of
scripture
how
beautiful
on
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
who
is
sent
of
god
i
had
left
the
parsonage
on
my
way
to
baptize
the
infant
and
name
it
and
perform
the
other
duties
required
by
law
when
i
met
the
baron
returning
to
the
house
your
ministrations
are
superfluous
he
said
our
child
is
to
be
without
name
on
this
earth
you
must
not
baptize
in
the
waters
of
an
earthly
church
one
who
has
just
been
immersed
in
the
fires
of
heaven
this
child
will
remain
a
blossom
it
will
not
grow
old
you
will
see
it
pass
away
you
exist
but
our
child
has
life
you
have
outward
senses
the
child
has
none
its
being
is
always
these
words
were
uttered
in
so
strange
and
supernatural
a
voice
that
i
was
more
affected
by
them
than
by
the
shining
of
his
face
from
which
light
appeared
to
exude
his
appearance
realized
the
phantasmal
ideas
which
we
form
of
inspired
beings
as
we
read
the
prophesies
of
the
bible
but
such
effects
are
not
rare
among
our
mountains
where
the
nitre
of
perpetual
snows
produces
extraordinary
phenomena
in
the
human
organization
i
asked
him
the
cause
of
his
emotion
swedenborg
came
to
us
he
has
just
left
me
i
have
breathed
the
air
of
heaven
he
replied
under
what
form
did
he
appear
i
said
under
his
earthly
form
dressed
as
he
was
the
last
time
i
saw
him
in
london
at
the
house
of
richard
shearsmith
in
july
he
wore
his
brown
frieze
coat
with
steel
buttons
his
waistcoat
buttoned
to
the
throat
a
white
cravat
and
the
same
magisterial
wig
rolled
and
powdered
at
the
sides
and
raised
high
in
front
showing
his
vast
and
luminous
brow
in
keeping
with
the
noble
square
face
where
all
is
power
and
tranquillity
i
recognized
the
large
nose
with
its
fiery
nostril
the
mouth
that
ever
smiled
angelic
mouth
from
which
these
words
the
pledge
of
my
happiness
have
just
issued
we
shall
meet
the
conviction
that
shone
on
the
baron
s
face
forbade
all
discussion
i
listened
in
silence
his
voice
had
a
contagious
heat
which
made
my
bosom
burn
within
me
his
fanaticism
stirred
my
heart
as
the
anger
of
another
makes
our
nerves
vibrate
i
followed
him
in
silence
to
his
house
where
i
saw
the
nameless
child
lying
mysteriously
folded
to
its
mother
s
breast
the
babe
heard
my
step
and
turned
its
head
toward
me
its
eyes
were
not
those
of
an
ordinary
child
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
impression
i
received
i
must
say
that
already
they
saw
and
thought
the
childhood
of
this
predestined
being
was
attended
by
circumstances
quite
extraordinary
in
our
climate
for
nine
years
our
winters
were
milder
and
our
summers
longer
than
usual
this
phenomenon
gave
rise
to
several
discussions
among
scientific
men
but
none
of
their
explanations
seemed
sufficient
to
academicians
and
the
baron
smiled
when
i
told
him
of
them
the
child
was
never
seen
in
its
nudity
as
other
children
are
it
was
never
touched
by
man
or
woman
but
lived
a
sacred
thing
upon
the
mother
s
breast
and
it
never
cried
if
you
question
old
david
he
will
confirm
these
facts
about
his
mistress
for
whom
he
feels
an
adoration
like
that
of
louis
ix
for
the
saint
whose
name
he
bore
at
nine
years
of
age
the
child
began
to
pray
prayer
is
her
life
you
saw
her
in
the
church
at
christmas
the
only
day
on
which
she
comes
there
she
is
separated
from
the
other
worshippers
by
a
visible
space
if
that
space
does
not
exist
between
herself
and
men
she
suffers
that
is
why
she
passes
nearly
all
her
time
alone
in
the
chateau
the
events
of
her
life
are
unknown
she
is
seldom
seen
her
days
are
spent
in
the
state
of
mystical
contemplation
which
was
so
catholic
writers
tell
us
habitual
with
the
early
christian
solitaries
in
whom
the
oral
tradition
of
christ
s
own
words
still
remained
her
mind
her
soul
her
body
all
within
her
is
virgin
as
the
snow
on
those
mountains
at
ten
years
of
age
she
was
just
what
you
see
her
now
when
she
was
nine
her
father
and
mother
expired
together
without
pain
or
visible
malady
after
naming
the
day
and
hour
at
which
they
would
cease
to
be
standing
at
their
feet
she
looked
at
them
with
a
calm
eye
not
showing
either
sadness
or
grief
or
joy
or
curiosity
when
we
approached
to
remove
the
two
bodies
she
said
carry
them
away
seraphita
i
said
for
so
we
called
her
are
you
not
affected
by
the
death
of
your
father
and
your
mother
who
loved
you
so
much
dead
she
answered
no
they
live
in
me
forever
that
is
nothing
she
pointed
without
emotion
to
the
bodies
they
were
bearing
away
i
then
saw
her
for
the
third
time
only
since
her
birth
in
church
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
her
she
stands
near
a
column
which
seen
from
the
pulpit
is
in
shadow
so
that
i
can
not
observe
her
features
of
all
the
servants
of
the
household
there
remained
after
the
death
of
the
master
and
mistress
only
old
david
who
in
spite
of
his
years
suffices
to
wait
on
his
mistress
some
of
our
jarvis
people
tell
wonderful
tales
about
her
these
have
a
certain
weight
in
a
land
so
essentially
conducive
to
mystery
as
ours
and
i
am
now
studying
the
treatise
on
incantations
by
jean
wier
and
other
works
relating
to
demonology
where
pretended
supernatural
events
are
recorded
hoping
to
find
facts
analogous
to
those
which
are
attributed
to
then
you
do
not
believe
in
her
said
wilfrid
oh
yes
i
do
said
the
pastor
genially
i
think
her
a
very
capricious
girl
a
little
spoilt
by
her
parents
who
turned
her
head
with
the
religious
ideas
i
have
just
revealed
to
minna
shook
her
head
in
a
way
that
gently
expressed
contradiction
poor
girl
continued
the
old
man
her
parents
bequeathed
to
her
that
fatal
exaltation
of
soul
which
misleads
mystics
and
renders
them
all
more
or
less
mad
she
subjects
herself
to
fasts
which
horrify
poor
david
the
good
old
man
is
like
a
sensitive
plant
which
quivers
at
the
slightest
breeze
and
glows
under
the
first
his
mistress
whose
incomprehensible
language
has
become
his
is
the
breeze
and
the
to
him
in
his
eyes
her
feet
are
diamonds
and
her
brow
is
strewn
with
stars
she
walks
environed
with
a
white
and
luminous
atmosphere
her
voice
is
accompanied
by
music
she
has
the
gift
of
rendering
herself
invisible
if
you
ask
to
see
her
he
will
tell
you
she
has
gone
to
the
it
is
difficult
to
believe
such
a
story
is
it
not
you
know
all
miracles
bear
more
or
less
resemblance
to
the
story
of
the
golden
tooth
we
have
our
golden
tooth
in
jarvis
that
is
all
duncker
the
fisherman
asserts
that
he
has
seen
her
plunge
into
the
fiord
and
come
up
in
the
shape
of
an
at
other
times
walking
on
the
billows
of
a
storm
fergus
who
leads
the
flocks
to
the
saeters
says
that
in
rainy
weather
a
circle
of
clear
sky
can
be
seen
over
the
swedish
castle
and
that
the
heavens
are
always
blue
above
seraphita
s
head
when
she
is
on
the
mountain
many
women
hear
the
tones
of
a
mighty
organ
when
seraphita
enters
the
church
and
ask
their
neighbors
earnestly
if
they
too
do
not
hear
them
but
my
daughter
for
whom
during
the
last
two
years
seraphita
has
shown
much
affection
has
never
heard
this
music
and
has
never
perceived
the
heavenly
perfumes
which
they
say
make
the
air
fragrant
about
her
when
she
moves
minna
to
be
sure
has
often
on
returning
from
their
walks
together
expressed
to
me
the
delight
of
a
young
girl
in
the
beauties
of
our
in
the
spicy
odors
of
budding
larches
and
pines
and
the
earliest
flowers
but
after
our
long
winters
what
can
be
more
natural
than
such
pleasure
the
companionship
of
this
spirit
has
nothing
so
very
extraordinary
in
it
has
it
my
child
the
secrets
of
that
spirit
are
not
mine
said
minna
near
it
i
know
all
away
from
it
i
know
nothing
near
that
exquisite
life
i
am
no
longer
myself
far
from
it
i
forget
all
the
time
we
pass
together
is
a
dream
which
my
memory
scarcely
retains
i
may
have
heard
yet
not
remember
the
music
which
the
women
tell
of
in
that
presence
i
may
have
breathed
celestial
perfumes
seen
the
glory
of
the
heavens
and
yet
be
unable
to
recollect
them
what
astonishes
me
most
resumed
the
pastor
addressing
wilfrid
is
to
notice
that
you
suffer
from
being
near
near
her
exclaimed
the
stranger
she
has
never
so
much
as
let
me
touch
her
hand
when
she
saw
me
for
the
first
time
her
glance
intimidated
me
she
said
you
are
welcome
here
for
you
were
to
i
fancied
that
she
knew
me
i
trembled
it
is
fear
that
forces
me
to
believe
in
with
me
it
is
love
said
minna
without
a
blush
are
you
making
fun
of
me
said
monsieur
becker
laughing
you
my
daughter
in
calling
yourself
a
spirit
of
love
and
you
monsieur
wilfrid
in
pretending
to
be
a
spirit
of
wisdom
he
drank
a
glass
of
beer
and
so
did
not
see
the
singular
look
which
wilfrid
cast
upon
minna
jesting
apart
resumed
the
old
gentleman
i
have
been
much
astonished
to
hear
that
these
two
ascended
to
the
summit
of
the
falberg
it
must
be
a
girlish
exaggeration
they
probably
went
to
the
crest
of
a
ledge
it
is
impossible
to
reach
the
peaks
of
the
if
so
father
said
minna
in
an
agitated
voice
i
must
have
been
under
the
power
of
a
spirit
for
indeed
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
this
is
really
serious
said
monsieur
becker
minna
is
always
monsieur
becker
said
wilfrid
i
swear
to
you
that
seraphita
exercises
such
extraordinary
power
over
me
that
i
know
no
language
in
which
i
can
give
you
the
least
idea
of
it
she
has
revealed
to
me
things
known
to
myself
somnambulism
said
the
old
man
a
great
many
such
effects
are
related
by
jean
wier
as
phenomena
easily
explained
and
formerly
observed
in
lend
me
swedenborg
s
theosophical
works
said
wilfrid
and
let
me
plunge
into
those
gulfs
of
light
you
have
given
me
a
thirst
for
monsieur
becker
took
down
a
volume
and
gave
it
to
his
guest
who
instantly
began
to
read
it
it
was
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
brought
in

over
each
turned
silently
to
his
or
her
occupation
the
pastor
read
the
incantations
wilfrid
pursued
the
spirit
of
swedenborg
and
the
young
girl
continued
to
sew
her
mind
absorbed
in
recollections
it
was
a
true
norwegian
evening
peaceful
studious
and
domestic
full
of
thoughts
flowers
blooming
beneath
the
snow
wilfrid
as
he
devoured
the
pages
of
the
prophet
lived
by
his
inner
senses
only
the
pastor
looking
up
at
times
from
his
book
called
minna
s
attention
to
the
absorption
of
their
guest
with
an
air
that
was
to
minna
s
thoughts
the
face
of
seraphitus
smiled
upon
her
as
it
hovered
above
the
clouds
of
smoke
which
enveloped
them
the
clock
struck
twelve
suddenly
the
outer
door
was
opened
violently
heavy
but
hurried
steps
the
steps
of
a
terrified
old
man
were
heard
in
the
narrow
vestibule
between
the
two
doors
then
david
burst
into
the
parlor
danger
danger
he
cried
come
come
all
the
evil
spirits
are
unchained
fiery
mitres
are
on
their
heads
demons
vertumni
sirens
they
tempt
her
as
jesus
was
tempted
on
the
mountain
come
come
and
drive
them
do
you
not
recognize
the
language
of
swedenborg
said
the
pastor
laughing
to
wilfrid
here
it
is
pure
from
the
but
wilfrid
and
minna
were
gazing
in
terror
at
old
david
who
with
hair
erect
and
eyes
distraught
his
legs
trembling
and
covered
with
snow
for
he
had
come
without
stood
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
if
some
boisterous
wind
were
shaking
him
is
he
harmed
cried
minna
the
devils
hope
and
try
to
conquer
her
replied
the
old
man
the
words
made
wilfrid
s
pulses
throb
for
the
last
five
hours
she
has
stood
erect
her
eyes
raised
to
heaven
and
her
arms
extended
she
suffers
she
cries
to
god
i
can
not
cross
the
barrier
hell
has
posted
the
vertumni
as
sentinels
they
have
set
up
an
iron
wall
between
her
and
her
old
david
she
wants
me
but
what
can
i
do
oh
help
me
help
me
come
and
pray
the
old
man
s
despair
was
terrible
to
see
the
light
of
god
is
defending
her
he
went
on
with
infectious
faith
but
oh
she
might
yield
to
silence
david
you
are
raving
this
is
a
matter
to
be
verified
we
will
go
with
you
said
the
pastor
and
you
shall
see
that
there
are
no
vertumni
nor
satans
nor
sirens
in
that
your
father
is
blind
whispered
david
to
minna
wilfrid
on
whom
the
reading
of
swedenborg
s
first
treatise
which
he
had
rapidly
gone
through
had
produced
a
powerful
effect
was
already
in
the
corridor
putting
on
his
skees
minna
was
ready
in
a
few
moments
and
both
left
the
old
men
far
behind
as
they
darted
forward
to
the
swedish
castle
do
you
hear
that
cracking
sound
said
wilfrid
the
ice
of
the
fiord
stirs
answered
minna
the
spring
is
wilfrid
was
silent
when
the
two
reached
the
courtyard
they
were
conscious
that
they
had
neither
the
faculty
nor
the
strength
to
enter
the
house
what
think
you
of
her
asked
wilfrid
see
that
radiance
cried
minna
going
towards
the
window
of
the
salon
he
is
there
how
beautiful
o
my
seraphitus
take
me
the
exclamation
was
uttered
inwardly
she
saw
seraphitus
standing
erect
lightly
swathed
in
an
mist
that
disappeared
at
a
little
distance
from
the
body
which
seemed
almost
phosphorescent
how
beautiful
she
is
cried
wilfrid
mentally
just
then
monsieur
becker
arrived
followed
by
david
he
saw
his
daughter
and
guest
standing
before
the
window
going
up
to
them
he
looked
into
the
salon
and
said
quietly
well
my
good
david
she
is
only
saying
her
ah
but
try
to
enter
why
disturb
those
who
pray
answered
the
pastor
at
this
instant
the
moon
rising
above
the
falberg
cast
its
rays
upon
the
window
all
three
turned
round
attracted
by
this
natural
effect
which
made
them
quiver
when
they
turned
back
to
again
look
at
seraphita
she
had
disappeared
how
strange
exclaimed
wilfrid
i
hear
delightful
sounds
said
minna
well
said
the
pastor
it
is
all
plain
enough
she
is
going
to
david
had
entered
the
house
the
others
took
their
way
back
in
silence
none
of
them
interpreted
the
vision
in
the
same
manner
monsieur
becker
doubted
minna
adored
wilfrid
longed
wilfrid
was
a
man
about
years
of
age
his
figure
though
broadly
developed
was
not
wanting
in
symmetry
like
most
men
who
distinguish
themselves
above
their
fellows
he
was
of
medium
height
his
chest
and
shoulders
were
broad
and
his
neck
short
a
characteristic
of
those
whose
hearts
are
near
their
heads
his
hair
was
black
thick
and
fine
his
eyes
of
a
yellow
brown
had
as
it
were
a
solar
brilliancy
which
proclaimed
with
what
avidity
his
nature
aspired
to
light
though
these
strong
and
virile
features
were
defective
through
the
absence
of
an
inward
peace
granted
only
to
a
life
without
storms
or
conflicts
they
plainly
showed
the
inexhaustible
resources
of
impetuous
senses
and
the
appetites
of
instinct
just
as
every
motion
revealed
the
perfection
of
the
man
s
physical
apparatus
the
flexibility
of
his
senses
and
their
fidelity
when
brought
into
play
this
man
might
contend
with
savages
and
hear
as
they
do
the
tread
of
enemies
in
distant
forests
he
could
follow
a
scent
in
the
air
a
trail
on
the
ground
or
see
on
the
horizon
the
signal
of
a
friend
his
sleep
was
light
like
that
of
all
creatures
who
will
not
allow
themselves
to
be
surprised
his
body
came
quickly
into
harmony
with
the
climate
of
any
country
where
his
tempestuous
life
conducted
him
art
and
science
would
have
admired
his
organization
in
the
light
of
a
human
model
everything
about
him
was
symmetrical
and
action
and
heart
intelligence
and
will
at
first
sight
he
might
be
classed
among
purely
instinctive
beings
who
give
themselves
blindly
up
to
the
material
wants
of
life
but
in
the
very
morning
of
his
days
he
had
flung
himself
into
a
higher
social
world
with
which
his
feelings
harmonized
study
had
widened
his
mind
reflection
had
sharpened
his
power
of
thought
and
the
sciences
had
enlarged
his
understanding
he
had
studied
human
laws
the
working
of
brought
into
conflict
by
the
passions
and
he
seemed
to
have
early
familiarized
himself
with
the
abstractions
on
which
societies
rest
he
had
pored
over
books
those
deeds
of
dead
humanity
he
had
spent
whole
nights
of
pleasure
in
every
european
capital
he
had
slept
on
fields
of
battle
the
night
before
the
combat
and
the
night
that
followed
victory
his
stormy
youth
may
have
flung
him
on
the
deck
of
some
corsair
and
sent
him
among
the
contrasting
regions
of
the
globe
thus
it
was
that
he
knew
the
actions
of
a
living
humanity
he
knew
the
present
and
the
past
a
double
history
that
of
that
of
other
days
many
men
have
been
like
wilfrid
equally
powerful
by
the
hand
by
the
heart
by
the
head
like
him
the
majority
have
abused
their
triple
power
but
though
this
man
still
held
by
certain
outward
liens
to
the
slimy
side
of
humanity
he
belonged
also
and
positively
to
the
sphere
where
force
is
intelligent
in
spite
of
the
many
veils
which
enveloped
his
soul
there
were
certain
ineffable
symptoms
of
this
fact
which
were
visible
to
pure
spirits
to
the
eyes
of
the
child
whose
innocence
has
known
no
breath
of
evil
passions
to
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
who
has
lived
to
regain
his
purity
these
signs
revealed
a
cain
for
whom
there
was
still
hope
one
who
seemed
as
though
he
were
seeking
absolution
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
minna
suspected
the
of
glory
in
the
man
seraphita
recognized
him
both
admired
and
both
pitied
him
whence
came
their
prescience
nothing
could
be
more
simple
nor
yet
more
extraordinary
as
soon
as
we
seek
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
nature
where
nothing
is
secret
and
where
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
the
eyes
to
see
we
perceive
that
the
simple
produces
the
marvellous
seraphitus
said
minna
one
evening
a
few
days
after
wilfrid
s
arrival
in
jarvis
you
read
the
soul
of
this
stranger
while
i
have
only
vague
impressions
of
it
he
chills
me
or
else
he
excites
me
but
you
seem
to
know
the
cause
of
this
cold
and
of
this
heat
tell
me
what
it
means
for
you
know
all
about
yes
i
have
seen
the
causes
said
seraphitus
lowing
his
large
eyelids
by
what
power
asked
the
curious
minna
i
have
the
gift
of
specialism
he
answered
specialism
is
an
inward
sight
which
can
penetrate
all
things
you
will
only
understand
its
full
meaning
through
a
comparison
in
the
great
cities
of
europe
where
works
are
produced
by
which
the
human
hand
seeks
to
represent
the
effects
of
the
moral
nature
was
well
as
those
of
the
physical
nature
there
are
glorious
men
who
express
ideas
in
marble
the
sculptor
acts
on
the
stone
he
fashions
it
he
puts
a
realm
of
ideas
into
it
there
are
statues
which
the
hand
of
man
has
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
representing
the
noble
side
of
humanity
or
the
whole
evil
side
most
men
see
in
such
marbles
a
human
figure
and
nothing
more
a
few
other
men
a
little
higher
in
the
scale
of
being
perceive
a
fraction
of
the
thoughts
expressed
in
the
statue
but
the
initiates
in
the
secrets
of
art
are
of
the
same
intellect
as
the
sculptor
they
see
in
his
work
the
whole
universe
of
his
thought
such
persons
are
in
themselves
the
principles
of
art
they
bear
within
them
a
mirror
which
reflects
nature
in
her
slightest
manifestations
well
so
it
is
with
me
i
have
within
me
a
mirror
before
which
the
moral
nature
with
its
causes
and
effects
appears
and
is
reflected
entering
thus
into
the
consciousness
of
others
i
am
able
to
divine
both
the
future
and
the
past
how
do
you
still
ask
how
imagine
that
the
marble
statue
is
the
body
of
a
man
a
piece
of
statuary
in
which
we
see
the
emotion
sentiment
passion
vice
or
crime
virtue
or
repentance
which
the
creating
hand
has
put
into
it
and
you
will
then
comprehend
how
it
is
that
i
read
the
soul
of
this
foreigner
though
what
i
have
said
does
not
explain
the
gift
of
specialism
for
to
conceive
the
nature
of
that
gift
we
must
possess
though
wilfrid
belonged
to
the
two
first
divisions
of
humanity
the
men
of
force
and
the
men
of
thought
yet
his
excesses
his
tumultuous
life
and
his
misdeeds
had
often
turned
him
towards
faith
for
doubt
has
two
sides
a
side
to
the
light
and
a
side
to
the
darkness
wilfrid
had
too
closely
clasped
the
world
under
its
forms
of
matter
and
of
mind
not
to
have
acquired
that
thirst
for
the
unknown
that
longing
to
which
lay
their
grasp
upon
the
men
who
know
and
wish
and
will
but
neither
his
knowledge
nor
his
actions
nor
his
will
had
found
direction
he
had
fled
from
social
life
from
necessity
as
a
great
criminal
seeks
the
cloister
remorse
that
virtue
of
weak
beings
did
not
touch
him
remorse
is
impotence
impotence
which
sins
again
repentance
alone
is
powerful
it
ends
all
but
in
traversing
the
world
which
he
made
his
cloister
wilfrid
had
found
no
balm
for
his
wounds
he
saw
nothing
in
nature
to
which
he
could
attach
himself
in
him
despair
had
dried
the
sources
of
desire
he
was
one
of
those
beings
who
having
gone
through
all
passions
and
come
out
victorious
have
nothing
more
to
raise
in
their
and
who
lacking
opportunity
to
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
their
to
trample
under
iron
heel
entire
populations
buy
at
the
price
of
a
horrible
martyrdom
the
faculty
of
ruining
themselves
in
some
belief
rocks
sublime
which
await
the
touch
of
a
wand
that
comes
not
to
bring
the
waters
gushing
from
their
spring
led
by
a
scheme
of
his
restless
inquiring
life
to
the
shores
of
norway
the
sudden
arrival
of
winter
had
detained
the
wanderer
at
jarvis
the
day
on
which
for
the
first
time
he
saw
seraphita
the
whole
past
of
his
life
faded
from
his
mind
the
young
girl
excited
emotions
which
he
had
thought
could
never
be
revived
the
ashes
gave
forth
a
lingering
flame
at
the
first
murmurings
of
that
voice
who
has
ever
felt
himself
return
to
youth
and
purity
after
growing
cold
and
numb
with
age
and
soiled
with
impurity
suddenly
wilfrid
loved
as
he
had
never
loved
he
loved
secretly
with
faith
with
fear
with
inward
madness
his
life
was
stirred
to
the
very
source
of
his
being
at
the
mere
thought
of
seeing
seraphita
as
he
listened
to
her
he
was
transported
into
unknown
worlds
he
was
mute
before
her
she
magnetized
him
there
beneath
the
snows
among
the
glaciers
bloomed
the
celestial
flower
to
which
his
hopes
so
long
betrayed
aspired
the
sight
of
which
awakened
ideas
of
freshness
purity
and
faith
which
grouped
about
his
soul
and
lifted
it
to
higher
regions
as
angels
bear
to
heaven
the
elect
in
those
symbolic
pictures
inspired
by
the
guardian
spirit
of
a
great
master
celestial
perfumes
softened
the
granite
hardness
of
the
rocky
scene
light
endowed
with
speech
shed
its
divine
melodies
on
the
path
of
him
who
looked
to
heaven
after
emptying
the
cup
of
terrestrial
love
which
his
teeth
had
bitten
as
he
drank
it
he
saw
before
him
the
chalice
of
salvation
where
the
limpid
waters
sparkled
making
thirsty
for
ineffable
delights
whoever
dare
apply
his
lips
burning
with
a
faith
so
strong
that
the
crystal
shall
not
be
shattered
but
wilfrid
now
encountered
the
wall
of
brass
for
which
he
had
been
seeking
up
and
down
the
earth
he
went
impetuously
to
seraphita
meaning
to
express
the
whole
force
and
bearing
of
a
passion
under
which
he
bounded
like
the
fabled
horse
beneath
the
iron
horseman
firm
in
his
saddle
whom
nothing
moves
while
the
efforts
of
the
fiery
animal
only
made
the
rider
heavier
and
more
solid
he
sought
her
to
relate
his
life
to
prove
the
grandeur
of
his
soul
by
the
grandeur
of
his
faults
to
show
the
ruins
of
his
desert
but
no
sooner
had
he
crossed
her
threshold
and
found
himself
within
the
zone
of
those
eyes
of
scintillating
azure
that
met
no
limits
forward
and
left
none
behind
than
he
grew
calm
and
submissive
as
a
lion
springing
on
his
prey
in
the
plains
of
africa
receives
from
the
wings
of
the
wind
a
message
of
love
and
stops
his
bound
a
gulf
opened
before
him
into
which
his
frenzied
words
fell
and
disappeared
and
from
which
uprose
a
voice
which
changed
his
being
he
became
as
a
child
a
child
of
sixteen
timid
and
frightened
before
this
maiden
with
serene
brow
this
white
figure
whose
inalterable
calm
was
like
the
cruel
impassibility
of
human
justice
the
combat
between
them
had
never
ceased
until
this
evening
when
with
a
glance
she
brought
him
down
as
a
falcon
making
his
dizzy
spirals
in
the
air
around
his
prey
causes
it
to
fall
stupefied
to
earth
before
carrying
it
to
his
eyrie
we
may
note
within
ourselves
many
a
long
struggle
the
end
of
which
is
one
of
our
own
actions
struggles
which
are
as
it
were
the
reverse
side
of
humanity
this
reverse
side
belongs
to
god
the
obverse
side
to
men
more
than
once
seraphita
had
proved
to
wilfrid
that
she
knew
this
hidden
and
ever
varied
side
which
is
to
the
majority
of
men
a
second
being
often
she
said
to
him
in
her
voice
why
all
this
vehemence
when
on
his
way
to
her
he
had
sworn
she
should
be
his
wilfrid
was
however
strong
enough
to
raise
the
cry
of
revolt
to
which
he
had
given
utterance
in
monsieur
becker
s
study
the
narrative
of
the
old
pastor
had
calmed
him
sceptical
and
derisive
as
he
was
he
saw
belief
like
a
sidereal
brilliance
dawning
on
his
life
he
asked
himself
if
seraphita
were
not
an
exile
from
the
higher
spheres
seeking
the
homeward
way
the
fanciful
deifications
of
all
ordinary
lovers
he
could
not
give
to
this
lily
of
norway
in
whose
divinity
he
believed
why
lived
she
here
beside
this
fiord
what
did
she
questions
that
received
no
answer
filled
his
mind
above
all
what
was
about
to
happen
between
them
what
fate
had
brought
him
there
to
him
seraphita
was
the
motionless
marble
light
nevertheless
as
a
vapor
which
minna
had
seen
that
day
poised
above
the
precipices
of
the
falberg
could
she
thus
stand
on
the
edge
of
all
gulfs
without
danger
without
a
tremor
of
the
arching
eyebrows
or
a
quiver
of
the
light
of
the
eye
if
his
love
was
to
be
without
hope
it
was
not
without
curiosity
from
the
moment
when
wilfrid
suspected
the
ethereal
nature
of
the
enchantress
who
had
told
him
the
secrets
of
his
life
in
melodious
utterance
he
had
longed
to
try
to
subject
her
to
keep
her
to
himself
to
tear
her
from
the
heaven
where
perhaps
she
was
awaited
earth
and
humanity
seized
their
prey
he
would
imitate
them
his
pride
the
only
sentiment
through
which
man
can
long
be
exalted
would
make
him
happy
in
this
triumph
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
idea
sent
the
blood
boiling
through
his
veins
and
his
heart
swelled
if
he
did
not
succeed
he
would
destroy
her
it
is
so
natural
to
destroy
that
which
we
can
not
possess
to
deny
what
we
can
not
comprehend
to
insult
that
which
we
envy
on
the
morrow
wilfrid
laden
with
ideas
which
the
extraordinary
events
of
the
previous
night
naturally
awakened
in
his
mind
resolved
to
question
david
and
went
to
find
him
on
the
pretext
of
asking
after
seraphita
s
health
though
monsieur
becker
spoke
of
the
old
servant
as
falling
into
dotage
wilfrid
relied
on
his
own
perspicacity
to
discover
scraps
of
truth
in
the
torrent
of
the
old
man
s
rambling
talk
david
had
the
immovable
undecided
physiognomy
of
an
octogenarian
under
his
white
hair
lay
a
forehead
lined
with
wrinkles
like
the
stone
courses
of
a
ruined
wall
and
his
face
was
furrowed
like
the
bed
of
a
torrent
his
life
seemed
to
have
retreated
wholly
to
the
eyes
where
light
still
shone
though
its
gleams
were
obscured
by
a
mistiness
which
seemed
to
indicate
either
an
active
mental
alienation
or
the
stupid
stare
of
drunkenness
his
slow
and
heavy
movements
betrayed
the
glacial
weight
of
age
and
communicated
an
icy
influence
to
whoever
allowed
themselves
to
look
long
at
him
for
he
possessed
the
magnetic
force
of
torpor
his
limited
intelligence
was
only
roused
by
the
sight
the
hearing
or
the
recollection
of
his
mistress
she
was
the
soul
of
this
wholly
material
fragment
of
an
existence
any
one
seeing
david
alone
by
himself
would
have
thought
him
a
corpse
let
seraphita
enter
let
her
voice
be
heard
or
a
mention
of
her
be
made
and
the
dead
came
forth
from
his
grave
and
recovered
speech
and
motion
the
dry
bones
were
not
more
truly
awakened
by
the
divine
breath
in
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
and
never
was
that
apocalyptic
vision
better
realized
than
in
this
lazarus
issuing
from
the
sepulchre
into
life
at
the
voice
of
a
young
girl
his
language
which
was
always
figurative
and
often
incomprehensible
prevented
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
from
talking
with
him
but
they
respected
a
mind
that
deviated
so
utterly
from
common
ways
a
thing
which
the
masses
instinctively
admire
wilfrid
found
him
in
the
antechamber
apparently
asleep
beside
the
stove
like
a
dog
who
recognizes
a
friend
of
the
family
the
old
man
raised
his
eyes
saw
the
foreigner
and
did
not
stir
where
is
she
inquired
wilfrid
sitting
down
beside
him
david
fluttered
his
fingers
in
the
air
as
if
to
express
the
flight
of
a
bird
does
she
still
suffer
asked
wilfrid
beings
vowed
to
heaven
are
able
so
to
suffer
that
suffering
does
not
lessen
their
love
this
is
the
mark
of
the
true
faith
answered
the
old
man
solemnly
like
an
instrument
which
on
being
touched
gives
forth
an
accidental
note
who
taught
you
those
words
the
what
happened
to
her
last
night
did
you
force
your
way
past
the
vertumni
standing
sentinel
did
you
evade
the
mammons
yes
answered
david
as
though
awaking
from
a
dream
the
misty
gleam
of
his
eyes
melted
into
a
ray
that
came
direct
from
the
soul
and
made
it
by
degrees
brilliant
as
that
of
an
eagle
as
intelligent
as
that
of
a
poet
what
did
you
see
asked
wilfrid
astonished
at
this
sudden
change
i
saw
species
and
shapes
i
heard
the
spirit
of
all
things
i
beheld
the
revolt
of
the
evil
ones
i
listened
to
the
words
of
the
good
seven
devils
came
and
seven
archangels
descended
from
on
high
the
archangels
stood
apart
and
looked
on
through
veils
the
devils
were
close
by
they
shone
they
acted
mammon
came
on
his
pearly
shell
in
the
shape
of
a
beautiful
naked
woman
her
snowy
body
dazzled
the
eye
no
human
form
ever
equalled
it
and
he
said
i
am
pleasure
thou
shalt
possess
me
lucifer
prince
of
serpents
was
there
in
sovereign
robes
his
manhood
was
glorious
as
the
beauty
of
an
angel
and
he
said
humanity
shall
be
at
thy
feet
the
queen
of
misers
she
who
gives
back
naught
that
she
has
ever
received
the
sea
came
wrapped
in
her
virent
mantle
she
opened
her
bosom
she
showed
her
gems
she
brought
forth
her
treasures
and
offered
them
waves
of
sapphire
and
of
emerald
came
at
her
bidding
her
hidden
wonders
stirred
they
rose
to
the
surface
of
her
breast
they
spoke
the
rarest
pearl
of
ocean
spread
its
iridescent
wings
and
gave
voice
to
its
marine
melodies
saying
twin
daughter
of
suffering
we
are
sisters
await
me
let
us
go
together
all
i
need
is
to
become
a
the
bird
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
and
the
paws
of
a
lion
the
head
of
a
woman
and
the
body
of
a
horse
the
animal
fell
down
before
her
and
licked
her
feet
and
promised
seven
hundred
years
of
plenty
to
her
daughter
then
came
the
most
formidable
of
all
the
child
weeping
at
her
knees
and
saying
wilt
thou
leave
me
feeble
and
suffering
as
i
am
oh
my
mother
stay
and
he
played
with
her
and
shed
languor
on
the
air
and
the
heavens
themselves
had
pity
for
his
wail
the
virgin
of
pure
song
brought
forth
her
choirs
to
relax
the
soul
the
kings
of
the
east
came
with
their
slaves
their
armies
and
their
women
the
wounded
asked
her
for
succor
the
sorrowful
stretched
forth
their
hands
do
not
leave
us
do
not
leave
us
they
cried
i
too
i
cried
do
not
leave
us
we
adore
thee
stay
flowers
bursting
from
the
seed
bathed
her
in
their
fragrance
which
uttered
stay
the
giant
enakim
came
forth
from
jupiter
leading
gold
and
its
friends
and
all
the
spirits
of
the
astral
regions
which
are
joined
with
him
and
they
said
we
are
thine
for
seven
hundred
at
last
came
death
on
his
pale
horse
crying
i
will
obey
thee
one
and
all
fell
prostrate
before
her
could
you
but
have
seen
them
they
covered
as
it
were
a
vast
plain
and
they
cried
aloud
to
her
we
have
nurtured
thee
thou
art
our
child
do
not
abandon
us
at
length
life
issued
from
her
ruby
waters
and
said
i
will
not
leave
thee
then
finding
seraphita
silent
she
flamed
upon
her
as
the
sun
crying
out
i
am
light
is
there
cried
seraphita
pointing
to
the
clouds
where
stood
the
archangels
but
she
was
wearied
out
desire
had
wrung
her
nerves
she
could
only
cry
my
god
my
god
ah
many
an
angelic
spirit
scaling
the
mountain
and
nigh
to
the
summit
has
set
his
foot
upon
a
rolling
stone
which
plunged
him
back
into
the
abyss
all
these
lost
spirits
adored
her
constancy
they
stood
around
her
a
choir
without
a
song
weeping
and
whispering
courage
at
last
she
conquered
desire
let
loose
upon
her
in
every
shape
and
every
species
was
vanquished
she
stood
in
prayer
and
when
at
last
her
eyes
were
lifted
she
saw
the
feet
of
angels
circling
in
the
she
saw
the
feet
of
angels
repeated
wilfrid
yes
said
the
old
man
was
it
a
dream
that
she
told
you
asked
wilfrid
a
dream
as
real
as
your
life
answered
david
i
was
the
calm
assurance
of
the
old
servant
affected
wilfrid
powerfully
he
went
away
asking
himself
whether
these
visions
were
any
less
extraordinary
than
those
he
had
read
of
in
swedenborg
the
night
before
if
spirits
exist
they
must
act
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
entered
the
parsonage
where
he
found
monsieur
becker
alone
dear
pastor
he
said
seraphita
is
connected
with
us
in
form
only
and
even
that
form
is
inexplicable
do
not
think
me
a
madman
or
a
lover
a
profound
conviction
can
not
be
argued
with
convert
my
belief
into
scientific
theories
and
let
us
try
to
enlighten
each
other
evening
we
shall
both
be
with
what
then
said
monsieur
becker
if
her
eye
ignores
space
replied
wilfrid
if
her
thought
is
an
intelligent
sight
which
enables
her
to
perceive
all
things
in
their
essence
and
to
connect
them
with
the
general
evolution
of
the
universe
if
in
a
word
she
sees
and
knows
all
let
us
seat
the
pythoness
on
her
tripod
let
us
force
this
pitiless
eagle
by
threats
to
spread
its
wings
help
me
i
breathe
a
fire
which
burns
my
vitals
i
must
quench
it
or
it
will
consume
me
i
have
found
a
prey
at
last
and
it
shall
be
mine
the
conquest
will
be
difficult
said
the
pastor
because
this
girl
is
is
what
cried
wilfrid
mad
said
the
old
man
i
will
not
dispute
her
madness
but
neither
must
you
dispute
her
wonderful
powers
dear
monsieur
becker
she
has
often
confounded
me
with
her
learning
has
she
travelled
from
her
house
to
the
fiord
no
never
left
this
place
exclaimed
wilfrid
then
she
must
have
read
not
a
page
not
one
iota
i
am
the
only
person
who
possesses
any
books
in
jarvis
the
works
of
swedenborg
the
only
books
that
were
in
the
chateau
you
see
before
you
she
has
never
looked
into
a
single
one
of
have
you
tried
to
talk
with
her
what
good
would
that
do
does
no
one
live
with
her
in
that
house
she
has
no
friends
but
you
and
minna
nor
any
servant
except
old
it
can
not
be
that
she
knows
nothing
of
science
nor
of
who
should
teach
her
said
the
pastor
but
if
she
can
discuss
such
matters
pertinently
as
she
has
often
done
with
me
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
girl
may
have
acquired
through
years
of
silence
the
faculties
enjoyed
by
apollonius
of
tyana
and
other
pretended
sorcerers
burned
by
the
inquisition
which
did
not
choose
to
admit
the
fact
of
if
she
can
speak
arabic
what
would
you
say
to
that
the
history
of
medical
science
gives
many
authentic
instances
of
girls
who
have
spoken
languages
entirely
unknown
to
what
can
i
do
exclaimed
wilfrid
she
knows
of
secrets
in
my
past
life
known
only
to
i
shall
be
curious
if
she
can
tell
me
thoughts
that
i
have
confided
to
no
living
person
said
monsieur
becker
minna
entered
the
room
well
my
daughter
and
how
is
your
familiar
spirit
he
suffers
father
she
answered
bowing
to
wilfrid
human
passions
clothed
in
their
false
riches
surrounded
him
all
night
and
showed
him
all
the
glories
of
the
world
but
you
think
these
things
mere
tales
as
beautiful
to
those
who
read
them
in
their
brains
as
the
arabian
nights
to
common
minds
said
the
pastor
smiling
did
not
satan
carry
our
savior
to
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
show
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
she
said
the
evangelists
replied
her
father
did
not
correct
their
copies
very
carefully
and
several
versions
are
in
you
believe
in
the
reality
of
these
visions
said
wilfrid
to
minna
who
can
doubt
when
he
relates
he
demanded
wilfrid
who
he
who
is
there
replied
minna
motioning
towards
the
chateau
are
you
speaking
of
seraphita
he
said
the
young
girl
bent
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
gentle
mischief
you
too
exclaimed
wilfrid
you
take
pleasure
in
confounding
me
who
and
what
is
she
what
do
you
think
of
her
what
i
feel
is
inexplicable
said
minna
blushing
you
are
all
crazy
cried
the
pastor
farewell
until
evening
said
wilfrid
chapter
iv
the
clouds
of
the
sanctuary
there
are
pageants
in
which
all
the
material
splendors
that
man
arrays
nations
of
slaves
and
divers
have
searched
the
sands
of
ocean
and
the
bowels
of
earth
for
the
pearls
and
diamonds
which
adorn
the
spectators
transmitted
as
heirlooms
from
generation
to
generation
these
treasures
have
shone
on
consecrated
brows
and
could
be
the
most
faithful
of
historians
had
they
speech
they
know
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
the
great
and
those
of
the
small
everywhere
do
they
go
they
are
worn
with
pride
at
festivals
carried
in
despair
to
usurers
borne
off
in
triumph
amid
blood
and
pillage
enshrined
in
masterpieces
conceived
by
art
for
their
protection
none
except
the
pearl
of
cleopatra
has
been
lost
the
great
and
the
fortunate
assemble
to
witness
the
coronation
of
some
king
whose
trappings
are
the
work
of
men
s
hands
but
the
purple
of
whose
raiment
is
less
glorious
than
that
of
the
flowers
of
the
field
these
festivals
splendid
in
light
bathed
in
music
which
the
hand
of
man
creates
aye
all
the
triumphs
of
that
hand
are
subdued
by
a
thought
crushed
by
a
sentiment
the
mind
can
illumine
in
a
man
and
round
a
man
a
light
more
vivid
can
open
his
ear
to
more
melodious
harmonies
can
seat
him
on
clouds
of
shining
constellations
and
teach
him
to
question
them
the
heart
can
do
still
greater
things
man
may
come
into
the
presence
of
one
sole
being
and
find
in
a
single
word
a
single
look
an
influence
so
weighty
to
bear
of
so
luminous
a
light
so
penetrating
a
sound
that
he
succumbs
and
kneels
before
it
the
most
real
of
all
splendors
are
not
in
outward
things
they
are
within
us
a
single
secret
of
science
is
a
realm
of
wonders
to
the
man
of
learning
do
the
trumpets
of
power
the
jewels
of
wealth
the
music
of
joy
or
a
vast
concourse
of
people
attend
his
mental
festival
no
he
finds
his
glory
in
some
dim
retreat
where
perchance
a
pallid
suffering
man
whispers
a
single
word
into
his
ear
that
word
like
a
torch
lighted
in
a
mine
reveals
to
him
a
science
all
human
ideas
arrayed
in
every
attractive
form
which
mystery
can
invent
surrounded
a
blind
man
seated
in
a
wayside
ditch
three
worlds
the
natural
the
spiritual
the
divine
with
all
their
spheres
opened
their
portals
to
a
florentine
exile
he
walked
attended
by
the
happy
and
the
unhappy
by
those
who
prayed
and
those
who
moaned
by
angels
and
by
souls
in
hell
when
the
sent
of
god
who
knew
and
could
accomplish
all
things
appeared
to
three
of
his
disciples
it
was
at
eventide
at
the
common
table
of
the
humblest
of
inns
and
then
and
there
the
light
broke
forth
shattering
material
forms
illuminating
the
spiritual
faculties
so
that
they
saw
him
in
his
glory
and
the
earth
lay
at
their
feet
like
a
sandal
monsieur
becker
wilfrid
and
minna
were
all
under
the
influence
of
fear
as
they
took
their
way
to
meet
the
extraordinary
being
whom
each
desired
to
question
to
them
in
their
several
ways
the
swedish
castle
had
grown
to
mean
some
gigantic
representation
some
spectacle
like
those
whose
colors
and
masses
are
skilfully
and
harmoniously
marshalled
by
the
poets
and
whose
personages
imaginary
actors
to
men
are
real
to
those
who
begin
to
penetrate
the
spiritual
world
on
the
tiers
of
this
coliseum
monsieur
becker
seated
the
gray
legions
of
doubt
the
stern
ideas
the
specious
formulas
of
dispute
he
convoked
the
various
antagonistic
worlds
of
philosophy
and
religion
and
they
all
appeared
in
the
guise
of
a
fleshless
shape
like
that
in
which
art
embodies
time
an
old
man
bearing
in
one
hand
a
scythe
in
the
other
a
broken
globe
the
human
universe
wilfrid
had
bidden
to
the
scene
his
earliest
illusions
and
his
latest
hopes
human
destiny
and
its
conflicts
religion
and
its
conquering
powers
minna
saw
heaven
confusedly
by
glimpses
love
raised
a
curtain
wrought
with
mysterious
images
and
the
melodious
sounds
which
met
her
ear
redoubled
her
curiosity
to
all
three
therefore
this
evening
was
to
be
what
that
other
evening
had
been
for
the
pilgrims
to
emmaus
what
a
vision
was
to
dante
an
inspiration
to
homer
to
them
three
aspects
of
the
world
revealed
veils
rent
away
doubts
dissipated
darkness
illumined
humanity
in
all
its
moods
expecting
light
could
not
be
better
represented
than
here
by
this
young
girl
this
man
in
the
vigor
of
his
age
and
these
old
men
of
whom
one
was
learned
enough
to
doubt
the
other
ignorant
enough
to
believe
never
was
any
scene
more
simple
in
appearance
nor
more
portentous
in
reality
when
they
entered
the
room
ushered
in
by
old
david
they
found
seraphita
standing
by
a
table
on
which
were
served
the
various
dishes
which
compose
a
tea
a
form
of
collation
which
in
the
north
takes
the
place
of
wine
and
its
pleasures
reserved
more
exclusively
for
southern
climes
certainly
nothing
proclaimed
in
her
or
in
him
a
being
with
the
strange
power
of
appearing
under
two
distinct
forms
nothing
about
her
betrayed
the
manifold
powers
which
she
wielded
like
a
careful
housewife
attending
to
the
comfort
of
her
guests
she
ordered
david
to
put
more
wood
into
the
stove
good
evening
my
neighbors
she
said
dear
monsieur
becker
you
do
right
to
come
you
see
me
living
for
the
last
time
perhaps
this
winter
has
killed
me
will
you
sit
there
she
said
to
wilfrid
and
you
minna
here
pointing
to
a
chair
beside
her
i
see
you
have
brought
your
embroidery
did
you
invent
that
stitch
the
design
is
very
pretty
for
whom
is
it
your
father
or
monsieur
she
added
turning
to
wilfrid
surely
we
ought
to
give
him
before
we
part
a
remembrance
of
the
daughters
of
did
you
suffer
much
yesterday
asked
wilfrid
it
was
nothing
she
answered
the
suffering
gladdened
me
it
was
necessary
to
enable
me
to
leave
this
then
death
does
not
alarm
you
said
monsieur
becker
smiling
for
he
did
not
think
her
no
dear
pastor
there
are
two
ways
of
dying
to
some
death
is
victory
to
others
do
you
think
that
you
have
conquered
asked
minna
i
do
not
know
she
said
perhaps
i
have
only
taken
a
step
in
the
the
lustrous
splendor
of
her
brow
grew
dim
her
eyes
were
veiled
beneath
lids
a
simple
movement
which
affected
the
prying
guests
and
kept
them
silent
monsieur
becker
was
the
first
to
recover
courage
dear
child
he
said
you
are
truth
itself
and
you
are
ever
kind
i
would
ask
of
you
something
other
than
the
dainties
of
your
if
we
may
believe
certain
persons
you
know
amazing
things
if
this
be
true
would
it
not
be
charitable
in
you
to
solve
a
few
of
our
doubts
ah
she
said
smiling
i
walk
on
the
clouds
i
visit
the
depths
of
the
fiord
the
sea
is
my
steed
and
i
bridle
it
i
know
where
the
singing
flower
grows
and
the
talking
light
descends
and
fragrant
colors
shine
i
wear
the
seal
of
solomon
i
am
a
fairy
i
cast
my
orders
to
the
wind
which
like
an
abject
slave
fulfils
them
my
eyes
can
pierce
the
earth
and
behold
its
treasures
for
lo
am
i
not
the
virgin
to
whom
the
pearls
dart
from
their
ocean
depths
and
who
led
me
safely
to
the
summit
of
the
falberg
said
minna
interrupting
her
thou
thou
too
exclaimed
the
strange
being
with
a
luminous
glance
at
the
young
girl
which
filled
her
soul
with
trouble
had
i
not
the
faculty
of
reading
through
your
foreheads
the
desires
which
have
brought
you
here
should
i
be
what
you
think
i
am
she
said
encircling
all
three
with
her
controlling
glance
to
david
s
great
satisfaction
the
old
man
rubbed
his
hands
with
pleasure
as
he
left
the
room
ah
she
resumed
after
a
pause
you
have
come
all
of
you
with
the
curiosity
of
children
you
my
poor
monsieur
becker
have
asked
yourself
how
it
was
possible
that
a
girl
of
seventeen
should
know
even
a
single
one
of
those
secrets
which
men
of
science
seek
with
their
noses
to
the
earth
instead
of
raising
their
eyes
to
heaven
were
i
to
tell
you
how
and
at
what
point
the
plant
merges
into
the
animal
you
would
begin
to
doubt
your
doubts
you
have
plotted
to
question
me
you
will
admit
that
yes
dear
seraphita
answered
wilfrid
but
the
desire
is
a
natural
one
to
men
is
it
not
you
will
bore
this
dear
child
with
such
topics
she
said
passing
her
hand
lightly
over
minna
s
hair
with
a
caressing
gesture
the
young
girl
raised
her
eyes
and
seemed
as
though
she
longed
to
lose
herself
in
him
speech
is
the
endowment
of
us
all
resumed
the
mysterious
creature
gravely
woe
to
him
who
keeps
silence
even
in
a
desert
believing
that
no
one
hears
him
all
voices
speak
and
all
ears
listen
here
below
speech
moves
the
universe
monsieur
becker
i
desire
to
say
nothing
unnecessarily
i
know
the
difficulties
that
beset
your
mind
would
you
not
think
it
a
miracle
if
i
were
now
to
lay
bare
the
past
history
of
your
consciousness
well
the
miracle
shall
be
accomplished
you
have
never
admitted
to
yourself
the
full
extent
of
your
doubts
i
alone
immovable
in
my
faith
i
can
show
it
to
you
i
can
terrify
you
with
yourself
you
stand
on
the
darkest
side
of
doubt
you
do
not
believe
in
god
although
you
know
it
not
and
all
things
here
below
are
secondary
to
him
who
rejects
the
first
principle
of
things
let
us
leave
aside
the
fruitless
discussions
of
false
philosophy
the
spiritualist
generations
made
as
many
and
as
vain
efforts
to
deny
matter
as
the
materialist
generations
have
made
to
deny
spirit
why
such
discussions
does
not
man
himself
offer
irrefragable
proof
of
both
systems
do
we
not
find
in
him
material
things
and
spiritual
things
none
but
a
madman
can
refuse
to
see
in
the
human
body
a
fragment
of
matter
your
natural
sciences
when
they
decompose
it
find
little
difference
between
its
elements
and
those
of
other
animals
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
produced
in
man
by
the
comparison
of
many
objects
has
never
seemed
to
any
one
to
belong
to
the
domain
of
matter
as
to
this
i
offer
no
opinion
i
am
now
concerned
with
your
doubts
not
with
my
certainties
to
you
as
to
the
majority
of
thinkers
the
relations
between
things
the
reality
of
which
is
proved
to
you
by
your
sensations
and
which
you
possess
the
faculty
to
discover
do
not
seem
material
the
natural
universe
of
things
and
beings
ends
in
man
with
the
spiritual
universe
of
similarities
or
differences
which
he
perceives
among
the
innumerable
forms
of
nature
relations
so
multiplied
as
to
seem
infinite
for
if
up
to
the
present
time
no
one
has
been
able
to
enumerate
the
separate
terrestrial
creations
who
can
reckon
their
correlations
is
not
the
fraction
which
you
know
in
relation
to
their
totality
what
a
single
number
is
to
infinity
here
then
you
fall
into
a
perception
of
the
infinite
which
undoubtedly
obliges
you
to
conceive
of
a
purely
spiritual
world
thus
man
himself
offers
sufficient
proof
of
the
two
orders
matter
and
spirit
in
him
culminates
a
visible
finite
universe
in
him
begins
a
universe
invisible
and
infinite
two
worlds
unknown
to
each
other
have
the
pebbles
of
the
fiord
a
perception
of
their
combined
being
have
they
a
consciousness
of
the
colors
they
present
to
the
eye
of
man
do
they
hear
the
music
of
the
waves
that
lap
them
let
us
therefore
spring
over
and
not
attempt
to
sound
the
abysmal
depths
presented
to
our
minds
in
the
union
of
a
material
universe
and
a
spiritual
universe
a
creation
visible
ponderable
tangible
terminating
in
a
creation
invisible
imponderable
intangible
completely
dissimilar
separated
by
the
void
yet
united
by
indisputable
bonds
and
meeting
in
a
being
who
derives
equally
from
the
one
and
from
the
other
let
us
mingle
in
one
world
these
two
worlds
absolutely
irreconcilable
to
your
philosophies
but
conjoined
by
fact
however
abstract
man
may
suppose
the
relation
which
binds
two
things
together
the
line
of
junction
is
perceptible
how
where
we
are
not
now
in
search
of
the
vanishing
point
where
matter
subtilizes
if
such
were
the
question
i
can
not
see
why
he
who
has
by
physical
relations
studded
with
stars
at
immeasurable
distances
the
heavens
which
veil
him
may
not
have
created
solid
substances
nor
why
you
deny
him
the
faculty
of
giving
a
body
to
thought
thus
your
invisible
moral
universe
and
your
visible
physical
universe
are
one
and
the
same
matter
we
will
not
separate
properties
from
substances
nor
objects
from
effects
all
that
exists
all
that
presses
upon
us
and
overwhelms
us
from
above
or
from
below
before
us
or
in
us
all
that
which
our
eyes
and
our
minds
perceive
all
these
named
and
unnamed
things
compose
in
order
to
fit
the
problem
of
creation
to
the
measure
of
your
logic
a
block
of
finite
matter
but
were
it
infinite
god
would
still
not
be
its
master
now
reasoning
with
your
views
dear
pastor
no
matter
in
what
way
god
the
infinite
is
concerned
with
this
block
of
finite
matter
he
can
not
exist
and
retain
the
attributes
with
which
man
invests
him
seek
him
in
facts
and
he
is
not
spiritually
and
materially
you
have
made
god
impossible
listen
to
the
word
of
human
reason
forced
to
its
ultimate
conclusions
in
bringing
god
face
to
face
with
the
great
whole
we
see
that
only
two
states
are
possible
between
them
either
god
and
matter
are
contemporaneous
or
god
existed
alone
before
matter
were
reason
the
light
that
has
guided
the
human
race
from
the
dawn
of
its
existence
accumulated
in
one
brain
even
that
mighty
brain
could
not
invent
a
third
mode
of
being
without
suppressing
both
matter
and
god
let
human
philosophies
pile
mountain
upon
mountain
of
words
and
of
ideas
let
religions
accumulate
images
and
beliefs
revelations
and
mysteries
you
must
face
at
last
this
terrible
dilemma
and
choose
between
the
two
propositions
which
compose
it
you
have
no
option
and
one
as
much
as
the
other
leads
human
reason
to
doubt
the
problem
thus
established
what
signifies
spirit
or
matter
why
trouble
about
the
march
of
the
worlds
in
one
direction
or
in
another
since
the
being
who
guides
them
is
shown
to
be
an
absurdity
why
continue
to
ask
whether
man
is
approaching
heaven
or
receding
from
it
whether
creation
is
rising
towards
spirit
or
descending
towards
matter
if
the
questioned
universe
gives
no
reply
what
signifies
theogonies
and
their
armies
theologies
and
their
dogmas
since
whichever
side
of
the
problem
is
man
s
choice
his
god
exists
not
let
us
for
a
moment
take
up
the
first
proposition
and
suppose
god
contemporaneous
with
matter
is
subjection
to
the
action
or
the
of
an
alien
substance
consistent
with
being
god
at
all
in
such
a
system
would
not
god
become
a
secondary
agent
compelled
to
organize
matter
if
so
who
compelled
him
between
his
material
gross
companion
and
himself
who
was
the
arbiter
who
paid
the
wages
of
the
six
days
labor
imputed
to
the
great
designer
has
any
determining
force
been
found
which
was
neither
god
nor
matter
god
being
regarded
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
machinery
of
the
worlds
is
it
not
as
ridiculous
to
call
him
god
as
to
call
the
slave
who
turns
the
grindstone
a
roman
citizen
besides
another
difficulty
as
insoluble
to
this
supreme
human
reason
as
it
is
to
god
presents
itself
if
we
carry
the
problem
higher
shall
we
not
be
like
the
hindus
who
put
the
world
upon
a
tortoise
the
tortoise
on
an
elephant
and
do
not
know
on
what
the
feet
of
their
elephant
may
rest
this
supreme
will
issuing
from
the
contest
between
god
and
matter
this
god
this
more
than
god
can
he
have
existed
throughout
eternity
without
willing
what
he
afterwards
willed
admitting
that
eternity
can
be
divided
into
two
eras
no
matter
where
god
is
what
becomes
of
his
intuitive
intelligence
if
he
did
not
know
his
ultimate
thought
which
then
is
the
true
eternity
the
created
eternity
or
the
uncreated
but
if
god
throughout
all
time
did
will
the
world
such
as
it
is
this
new
necessity
which
harmonizes
with
the
idea
of
sovereign
intelligence
implies
the
of
matter
whether
matter
be
by
a
divine
will
necessarily
accordant
with
itself
from
the
beginning
or
whether
matter
be
of
its
own
being
the
power
of
god
which
must
be
absolute
perishes
if
his
will
is
circumscribed
for
in
that
case
god
would
find
within
him
a
determining
force
which
would
control
him
can
he
be
god
if
he
can
no
more
separate
himself
from
his
creation
in
a
past
eternity
than
in
the
coming
eternity
this
face
of
the
problem
is
insoluble
in
its
cause
let
us
now
inquire
into
its
effects
if
a
god
compelled
to
have
created
the
world
from
all
eternity
seems
inexplicable
he
is
quite
as
unintelligible
in
perpetual
cohesion
with
his
work
god
constrained
to
live
eternally
united
to
his
creation
is
held
down
to
his
first
position
as
workman
can
you
conceive
of
a
god
who
shall
be
neither
independent
of
nor
dependent
on
his
work
could
he
destroy
that
work
without
challenging
himself
ask
yourself
and
decide
whether
he
destroys
it
some
day
or
whether
he
never
destroys
it
either
way
is
fatal
to
the
attributes
without
which
god
can
not
exist
is
the
world
an
experiment
is
it
a
perishable
form
to
which
destruction
must
come
if
it
is
is
not
god
inconsistent
and
impotent
inconsistent
because
he
ought
to
have
seen
the
result
before
the
attempt
moreover
why
should
he
delay
to
destroy
that
which
he
is
to
destroy
impotent
for
how
else
could
he
have
created
an
imperfect
man
if
an
imperfect
creation
contradicts
the
faculties
which
man
attributes
to
god
we
are
forced
back
upon
the
question
is
creation
perfect
the
idea
is
in
harmony
with
that
of
a
god
supremely
intelligent
who
could
make
no
mistakes
but
then
what
means
the
degradation
of
his
work
and
its
regeneration
moreover
a
perfect
world
is
necessarily
indestructible
its
forms
would
not
perish
it
could
neither
advance
nor
recede
it
would
revolve
in
the
everlasting
circumference
from
which
it
would
never
issue
in
that
case
god
would
be
dependent
on
his
work
it
would
be
with
him
and
so
we
fall
back
into
one
of
the
propositions
most
antagonistic
to
god
if
the
world
is
imperfect
it
can
progress
if
perfect
it
is
stationary
on
the
other
hand
if
it
be
impossible
to
admit
of
a
progressive
god
ignorant
through
a
past
eternity
of
the
results
of
his
creative
work
can
there
be
a
stationary
god
would
not
that
imply
the
triumph
of
matter
would
it
not
be
the
greatest
of
all
negations
under
the
first
hypothesis
god
perishes
through
weakness
under
the
second
through
the
force
of
his
inertia
therefore
to
all
sincere
minds
the
supposition
that
matter
in
the
conception
and
execution
of
the
worlds
is
contemporaneous
with
god
is
to
deny
god
forced
to
choose
in
order
to
govern
the
nations
between
the
two
alternatives
of
the
problem
whole
generations
have
preferred
this
solution
of
it
hence
the
doctrine
of
the
two
principles
of
magianism
brought
from
asia
and
adopted
in
europe
under
the
form
of
satan
warring
with
the
eternal
father
but
this
religious
formula
and
the
innumerable
aspects
of
divinity
that
have
sprung
from
it
are
surely
crimes
against
the
majesty
divine
what
other
term
can
we
apply
to
the
belief
which
sets
up
as
a
rival
to
god
a
personification
of
evil
striving
eternally
against
the
omnipotent
mind
without
the
possibility
of
ultimate
triumph
your
statics
declare
that
two
forces
thus
pitted
against
each
other
are
reciprocally
rendered
null
do
you
turn
back
therefore
to
the
other
side
of
the
problem
and
say
that
god
original
alone
i
will
not
go
over
the
preceding
arguments
which
here
return
in
full
force
as
to
the
severance
of
eternity
into
two
parts
nor
the
questions
raised
by
the
progression
or
the
immobility
of
the
worlds
let
us
look
only
at
the
difficulties
inherent
to
this
second
theory
if
god
alone
the
world
must
have
emanated
from
him
matter
was
therefore
drawn
from
his
essence
consequently
matter
in
itself
is
all
forms
are
veils
to
cover
the
divine
spirit
if
this
be
so
the
world
is
eternal
and
also
it
must
be
god
is
not
this
proposition
even
more
fatal
than
the
former
to
the
attributes
conferred
on
god
by
human
reason
how
can
the
actual
condition
of
matter
be
explained
if
we
suppose
it
to
issue
from
the
bosom
of
god
and
to
be
ever
united
with
him
is
it
possible
to
believe
that
the
supremely
good
in
his
essence
and
in
his
faculties
has
engendered
things
dissimilar
to
himself
must
he
not
in
all
things
and
through
all
things
be
like
unto
himself
can
there
be
in
god
certain
evil
parts
of
which
at
some
future
day
he
may
rid
himself
a
conjecture
less
offensive
and
absurd
than
terrible
for
the
reason
that
it
drags
back
into
him
the
two
principles
which
the
preceding
theory
proved
to
be
inadmissible
god
must
be
one
he
can
not
be
divided
without
renouncing
the
most
important
condition
of
his
existence
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
admit
of
a
fraction
of
god
which
yet
is
not
god
this
hypothesis
seemed
so
criminal
to
the
roman
church
that
she
has
made
the
omnipresence
of
god
in
the
least
particles
of
the
eucharist
an
article
of
faith
but
how
then
can
we
imagine
an
omnipotent
mind
which
does
not
triumph
how
associate
it
unless
in
triumph
with
nature
but
nature
is
not
triumphant
she
seeks
combines
remodels
dies
and
is
born
again
she
is
even
more
convulsed
when
creating
than
when
all
was
fusion
nature
suffers
groans
is
ignorant
degenerates
does
evil
deceives
herself
annihilates
herself
disappears
and
begins
again
if
god
is
associated
with
nature
how
can
we
explain
the
inoperative
indifference
of
the
divine
principle
wherefore
death
how
came
it
that
evil
king
of
the
earth
was
born
of
a
god
supremely
good
in
his
essence
and
in
his
faculties
who
can
produce
nothing
that
is
not
made
in
his
own
image
but
if
from
this
relentless
conclusion
which
leads
at
once
to
absurdity
we
pass
to
details
what
end
are
we
to
assign
to
the
world
if
all
is
god
all
is
reciprocally
cause
and
effect
all
is
as
god
is
and
we
can
perceive
neither
points
of
likeness
nor
points
of
difference
can
the
real
end
be
a
rotation
of
matter
which
subtilizes
and
disappears
in
whatever
sense
it
were
done
would
not
this
mechanical
trick
of
matter
issuing
from
god
and
returning
to
god
seem
a
sort
of
child
s
play
why
should
god
make
himself
gross
with
matter
under
which
form
is
he
most
god
which
has
the
ascendant
matter
or
spirit
when
neither
can
in
any
way
do
wrong
who
can
comprehend
the
deity
engaged
in
this
perpetual
business
by
which
he
divides
himself
into
two
natures
one
of
which
knows
nothing
while
the
other
knows
all
can
you
conceive
of
god
amusing
himself
in
the
form
of
man
laughing
at
his
own
efforts
dying
friday
to
be
born
again
sunday
and
continuing
this
play
from
age
to
age
knowing
the
end
from
all
eternity
and
telling
nothing
to
himself
the
creature
of
what
he
the
creator
does
the
god
of
the
preceding
hypothesis
a
god
so
nugatory
by
the
very
power
of
his
inertia
seems
the
more
possible
of
the
two
if
we
are
compelled
to
choose
between
the
impossibilities
with
which
this
god
so
dull
a
jester
fusillades
himself
when
two
sections
of
humanity
argue
face
to
face
weapons
in
hand
however
absurd
this
outcome
of
the
second
problem
may
seem
it
was
adopted
by
half
the
human
race
in
the
sunny
lands
where
smiling
mythologies
were
created
those
amorous
nations
were
consistent
with
them
all
was
god
even
fear
and
its
dastardy
even
crime
and
its
bacchanals
if
we
accept
pantheism
the
religion
of
many
a
great
human
genius
who
shall
say
where
the
greater
reason
lies
is
it
with
the
savage
free
in
the
desert
clothed
in
his
nudity
listening
to
the
sun
talking
to
the
sea
sublime
and
always
true
in
his
deeds
whatever
they
may
be
or
shall
we
find
it
in
civilized
man
who
derives
his
chief
enjoyments
through
lies
who
wrings
nature
and
all
her
resources
to
put
a
musket
on
his
shoulder
who
employs
his
intellect
to
hasten
the
hour
of
his
death
and
to
create
diseases
out
of
pleasures
when
the
rake
of
pestilence
and
the
ploughshare
of
war
and
the
demon
of
desolation
have
passed
over
a
corner
of
the
globe
and
obliterated
all
things
who
will
be
found
to
have
the
greater
reason
the
nubian
savage
or
the
patrician
of
thebes
your
doubts
descend
the
scale
they
go
from
heights
to
depths
they
embrace
all
the
end
as
well
as
the
means
but
if
the
physical
world
seems
inexplicable
the
moral
world
presents
still
stronger
arguments
against
god
where
then
is
progress
if
all
things
are
indeed
moving
toward
perfection
why
do
we
die
young
why
do
not
nations
perpetuate
themselves
the
world
having
issued
from
god
and
being
contained
in
god
can
it
be
stationary
do
we
live
once
or
do
we
live
always
if
we
live
once
hurried
onward
by
the
march
of
the
a
knowledge
of
which
has
not
been
given
to
us
let
us
act
as
we
please
if
we
are
eternal
let
things
take
their
course
is
the
created
being
guilty
if
he
exists
at
the
instant
of
the
transitions
if
he
sins
at
the
moment
of
a
great
transformation
will
he
be
punished
for
it
after
being
its
victim
what
becomes
of
the
divine
goodness
if
we
are
not
transferred
to
the
regions
of
the
blest
should
any
such
exist
what
becomes
of
god
s
prescience
if
he
is
ignorant
of
the
results
of
the
trials
to
which
he
subjects
us
what
is
this
alternative
offered
to
man
by
all
religions
either
to
boil
in
some
eternal
cauldron
or
to
walk
in
white
robes
a
palm
in
his
hand
and
a
halo
round
his
head
can
it
be
that
this
pagan
invention
is
the
final
word
of
god
where
is
the
generous
soul
who
does
not
feel
that
the
calculating
virtue
which
seeks
the
eternity
of
pleasure
offered
by
all
religions
to
whoever
fulfils
at
stray
moments
certain
fanciful
and
often
unnatural
conditions
is
unworthy
of
man
and
of
god
is
it
not
a
mockery
to
give
to
man
impetuous
senses
and
forbid
him
to
satisfy
them
besides
what
mean
these
ascetic
objections
if
good
and
evil
are
equally
abolished
does
evil
exist
if
substance
in
all
its
forms
is
god
then
evil
is
god
the
faculty
of
reasoning
as
well
as
the
faculty
of
feeling
having
been
given
to
man
to
use
nothing
can
be
more
excusable
in
him
than
to
seek
to
know
the
meaning
of
human
suffering
and
the
prospects
of
the
future
if
these
rigid
and
rigorous
arguments
lead
to
such
conclusions
confusion
must
reign
the
world
would
have
no
fixedness
nothing
would
advance
nothing
would
pause
all
would
change
nothing
would
be
destroyed
all
would
reappear
after
for
if
your
mind
does
not
clearly
demonstrate
to
you
an
end
it
is
equally
impossible
to
demonstrate
the
destruction
of
the
smallest
particle
of
matter
matter
can
transform
but
not
annihilate
itself
though
blind
force
may
provide
arguments
for
the
atheist
intelligent
force
is
inexplicable
for
if
it
emanates
from
god
why
should
it
meet
with
obstacles
ought
not
its
triumph
to
be
immediate
where
is
god
if
the
living
can
not
perceive
him
can
the
dead
find
him
crumble
ye
idolatries
and
ye
religions
fall
feeble
keystones
of
all
social
arches
powerless
to
retard
the
decay
the
death
the
oblivion
that
have
overtaken
all
nations
however
firmly
founded
fall
morality
and
justice
our
crimes
are
purely
relative
they
are
divine
effects
whose
causes
we
are
not
allowed
to
know
all
is
god
either
we
are
god
or
god
is
not
child
of
a
century
whose
every
year
has
laid
upon
your
brow
old
man
the
ice
of
its
unbelief
here
here
is
the
summing
up
of
your
lifetime
of
thought
of
your
science
and
your
reflections
dear
monsieur
becker
you
have
laid
your
head
upon
the
pillow
of
doubt
because
it
is
the
easiest
of
solutions
acting
in
this
respect
with
the
majority
of
mankind
who
say
in
their
hearts
let
us
think
no
more
of
these
problems
since
god
has
not
vouchsafed
to
grant
us
the
algebraic
demonstrations
that
could
solve
them
while
he
has
given
us
so
many
other
ways
to
get
from
earth
to
tell
me
dear
pastor
are
not
these
your
secret
thoughts
have
i
evaded
the
point
of
any
nay
rather
have
i
not
clearly
stated
all
first
in
the
dogma
of
two
principles
an
antagonism
in
which
god
perishes
for
the
reason
that
being
he
chose
to
combat
secondly
in
the
absurd
pantheism
where
all
being
god
god
exists
no
longer
these
two
sources
from
which
have
flowed
all
the
religions
for
whose
triumph
earth
has
toiled
and
prayed
are
equally
pernicious
behold
in
them
the
axe
with
which
you
decapitate
the
white
old
man
whom
you
enthrone
among
your
painted
clouds
and
now
to
me
the
axe
i
wield
it
monsieur
becker
and
wilfrid
gazed
at
the
young
girl
with
something
like
terror
to
believe
continued
seraphita
in
her
woman
s
voice
for
the
man
had
finished
speaking
to
believe
is
a
gift
to
believe
is
to
feel
to
believe
in
god
we
must
feel
god
this
feeling
is
a
possession
slowly
acquired
by
the
human
being
just
as
other
astonishing
powers
which
you
admire
in
great
men
warriors
artists
scholars
those
who
know
and
those
who
act
are
acquired
thought
that
budget
of
the
relations
which
you
perceive
among
created
things
is
an
intellectual
language
which
can
be
learned
is
it
not
belief
the
budget
of
celestial
truths
is
also
a
language
as
superior
to
thought
as
thought
is
to
instinct
this
language
also
can
be
learned
the
believer
answers
with
a
single
cry
a
single
gesture
faith
puts
within
his
hand
a
flaming
sword
with
which
he
pierces
and
illumines
all
the
seer
attains
to
heaven
and
descends
not
but
there
are
beings
who
believe
and
see
who
know
and
will
who
love
and
pray
and
wait
submissive
yet
aspiring
to
the
kingdom
of
light
they
have
neither
the
aloofness
of
the
believer
nor
the
silence
of
the
seer
they
listen
and
reply
to
them
the
doubt
of
the
twilight
ages
is
not
a
murderous
weapon
but
a
divining
rod
they
accept
the
contest
under
every
form
they
train
their
tongues
to
every
language
they
are
never
angered
though
they
groan
the
acrimony
of
the
aggressor
is
not
in
them
but
rather
the
softness
and
tenuity
of
light
which
penetrates
and
warms
and
illumines
to
their
eyes
doubt
is
neither
an
impiety
nor
a
blasphemy
nor
a
crime
but
a
transition
through
which
men
return
upon
their
steps
in
the
darkness
or
advance
into
the
light
this
being
so
dear
pastor
let
us
reason
together
you
do
not
believe
in
god
why
god
to
your
thinking
is
incomprehensible
inexplicable
agreed
i
will
not
reply
that
to
comprehend
god
in
his
entirety
would
be
to
be
god
nor
will
i
tell
you
that
you
deny
what
seems
to
you
inexplicable
so
as
to
give
me
the
right
to
affirm
that
which
to
me
is
believable
there
is
for
you
one
evident
fact
which
lies
within
yourself
in
you
matter
has
ended
in
intelligence
can
you
therefore
think
that
human
intelligence
will
end
in
darkness
doubt
and
nothingness
god
may
seem
to
you
incomprehensible
and
inexplicable
but
you
must
admit
him
to
be
in
all
things
purely
physical
a
splendid
and
consistent
workman
why
should
his
craft
stop
short
at
man
his
most
finished
creation
if
that
question
is
not
convincing
at
least
it
compels
meditation
happily
although
you
deny
god
you
are
obliged
in
order
to
establish
your
doubts
to
admit
those
facts
which
kill
your
arguments
as
much
as
your
arguments
kill
god
we
have
also
admitted
that
matter
and
spirit
are
two
creations
which
do
not
comprehend
each
other
that
the
spiritual
world
is
formed
of
infinite
relations
to
which
the
finite
material
world
has
given
rise
that
if
no
one
on
earth
is
able
to
identify
himself
by
the
power
of
his
spirit
with
the
of
terrestrial
creations
still
less
is
he
able
to
rise
to
the
knowledge
of
the
relations
which
the
spirit
perceives
between
these
creations
we
might
end
the
argument
here
in
one
word
by
denying
you
the
faculty
of
comprehending
god
just
as
you
deny
to
the
pebbles
of
the
fiord
the
faculties
of
counting
and
of
seeing
each
other
how
do
you
know
that
the
stones
themselves
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
man
though
man
makes
use
of
them
to
build
his
houses
there
is
one
fact
that
appals
you
the
infinite
if
you
feel
it
within
why
will
you
not
admit
its
consequences
can
the
finite
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
infinite
if
you
can
not
perceive
those
relations
which
according
to
your
own
admission
are
infinite
how
can
you
grasp
a
sense
of
the
end
to
which
they
are
converging
order
the
revelation
of
which
is
one
of
your
needs
being
infinite
can
your
limited
reason
apprehend
it
do
not
ask
why
man
does
not
comprehend
that
which
he
is
able
to
perceive
for
he
is
equally
able
to
perceive
that
which
he
does
not
comprehend
if
i
prove
to
you
that
your
mind
ignores
that
which
lies
within
its
compass
will
you
grant
that
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
conceive
whatever
is
beyond
it
this
being
so
am
i
not
justified
in
saying
to
you
one
of
the
two
propositions
under
which
god
is
annihilated
before
the
tribunal
of
our
reason
must
be
true
the
other
is
false
inasmuch
as
creation
exists
you
feel
the
necessity
of
an
end
and
that
end
should
be
good
should
it
not
now
if
matter
terminates
in
man
by
intelligence
why
are
you
not
satisfied
to
believe
that
the
end
of
human
intelligence
is
the
light
of
the
higher
spheres
where
alone
an
intuition
of
that
god
who
seems
so
insoluble
a
problem
is
obtained
the
species
which
are
beneath
you
have
no
conception
of
the
universe
and
you
have
why
should
there
not
be
other
species
above
you
more
intelligent
than
your
own
man
ought
to
be
better
informed
than
he
is
about
himself
before
he
spends
his
strength
in
measuring
god
before
attacking
the
stars
that
light
us
and
the
higher
certainties
ought
he
not
to
understand
the
certainties
which
are
actually
about
him
but
no
to
the
negations
of
doubt
i
ought
rather
to
reply
by
negations
therefore
i
ask
you
whether
there
is
anything
here
below
so
evident
that
i
can
put
faith
in
it
i
will
show
you
in
a
moment
that
you
believe
firmly
in
things
which
act
and
yet
are
not
beings
in
things
which
engender
thought
and
yet
are
not
spirits
in
living
abstractions
which
the
understanding
can
not
grasp
in
any
shape
which
are
in
fact
nowhere
but
which
you
perceive
everywhere
which
have
and
can
have
on
name
but
which
nevertheless
you
have
named
and
which
like
the
god
of
flesh
upon
whom
you
figure
to
yourself
remain
inexplicable
incomprehensible
and
absurd
i
shall
also
ask
you
why
after
admitting
the
existence
of
these
incomprehensible
things
you
reserve
your
doubts
for
god
you
believe
for
instance
in
number
a
base
on
which
you
have
built
the
edifice
of
sciences
which
you
call
without
number
what
would
become
of
mathematics
well
what
mysterious
being
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
living
forever
could
utter
and
what
language
would
be
compact
to
word
the
number
which
contains
the
infinite
numbers
whose
existence
is
revealed
to
you
by
thought
ask
it
of
the
loftiest
human
genius
he
might
ponder
it
for
a
thousand
years
and
what
would
be
his
answer
you
know
neither
where
number
begins
nor
where
it
pauses
nor
where
it
ends
here
you
call
it
time
there
you
call
it
space
nothing
exists
except
by
number
without
it
all
would
be
one
and
the
same
substance
for
number
alone
differentiates
and
qualifies
substance
number
is
to
your
spirit
what
it
is
to
matter
an
incomprehensible
agent
will
you
make
a
deity
of
it
is
it
a
being
is
it
a
breath
emanating
from
god
to
organize
the
material
universe
where
nothing
obtains
form
except
by
the
divinity
which
is
an
effect
of
number
the
least
as
well
as
the
greatest
of
creations
are
distinguishable
from
each
other
by
quantities
qualities
dimensions
forces
all
attributes
created
by
number
the
infinitude
of
numbers
is
a
fact
proved
to
your
soul
but
of
which
no
material
proof
can
be
given
the
mathematician
himself
tells
you
that
the
infinite
of
numbers
exists
but
can
not
be
proved
god
dear
pastor
is
a
number
endowed
with
motion
felt
but
not
seen
the
believer
will
tell
you
like
the
unit
he
begins
number
with
which
he
has
nothing
in
common
the
existence
of
number
depends
on
the
unit
which
without
being
a
number
engenders
number
god
dear
pastor
is
a
glorious
unit
who
has
nothing
in
common
with
his
creations
but
who
nevertheless
engenders
them
will
you
not
therefore
agree
with
me
that
you
are
just
as
ignorant
of
where
number
begins
and
ends
as
you
are
of
where
created
eternity
begins
and
ends
why
then
if
you
believe
in
number
do
you
deny
god
is
not
creation
interposed
between
the
infinite
of
unorganized
substances
and
the
infinite
of
the
divine
spheres
just
as
the
unit
stands
between
the
cipher
of
the
fractions
you
have
lately
named
decimals
and
the
infinite
of
numbers
which
you
call
wholes
man
alone
on
earth
comprehends
number
that
first
step
of
the
peristyle
which
leads
to
god
and
yet
his
reason
stumbles
on
it
what
you
can
neither
measure
nor
grasp
the
first
abstraction
which
god
delivers
to
you
and
yet
you
try
to
subject
his
ends
to
your
own
suppose
that
i
plunge
you
into
the
abyss
of
motion
the
force
that
organizes
number
if
i
tell
you
that
the
universe
is
naught
else
than
number
and
motion
you
would
see
at
once
that
we
speak
two
different
languages
i
understand
them
both
you
understand
neither
suppose
i
add
that
motion
and
number
are
engendered
by
the
word
namely
the
supreme
reason
of
seers
and
prophets
who
in
the
olden
time
heard
the
breath
of
god
beneath
which
saul
fell
to
the
earth
that
word
you
scoff
at
it
you
men
although
you
well
know
that
all
visible
works
societies
monuments
deeds
passions
proceed
from
the
breath
of
your
own
feeble
word
and
that
without
that
word
you
would
resemble
the
african
gorilla
the
nearest
approach
to
man
the
negro
you
believe
firmly
in
number
and
in
motion
a
force
and
a
result
both
inexplicable
incomprehensible
to
the
existence
of
which
i
may
apply
the
logical
dilemma
which
as
we
have
seen
prevents
you
from
believing
in
god
powerful
reasoner
that
you
are
you
do
not
need
that
i
should
prove
to
you
that
the
infinite
must
everywhere
be
like
unto
itself
and
that
necessarily
it
is
one
god
alone
is
infinite
for
surely
there
can
not
be
two
infinities
two
ones
if
to
make
use
of
human
terms
anything
demonstrated
to
you
here
below
seems
to
you
infinite
be
sure
that
within
it
you
will
find
some
one
aspect
of
god
but
to
continue
you
have
appropriated
to
yourself
a
place
in
the
infinite
of
number
you
have
fitted
it
to
your
own
proportions
by
creating
if
indeed
you
did
create
arithmetic
the
basis
on
which
all
things
rest
even
your
societies
just
as
number
the
only
thing
in
which
your
atheists
believe
organized
physical
creations
so
arithmetic
in
the
employ
of
number
organized
the
moral
world
this
numeration
must
be
absolute
like
all
else
that
is
true
in
itself
but
it
is
purely
relative
it
does
not
exist
absolutely
and
no
proof
can
be
given
of
its
reality
in
the
first
place
though
numeration
is
able
to
take
account
of
organized
substances
it
is
powerless
in
relation
to
unorganized
forces
the
ones
being
finite
and
the
others
infinite
the
man
who
can
conceive
the
infinite
by
his
intelligence
can
not
deal
with
it
in
its
entirety
if
he
could
he
would
be
god
your
numeration
applying
to
things
finite
and
not
to
the
infinite
is
therefore
true
in
relation
to
the
details
which
you
are
able
to
perceive
and
false
in
relation
to
the
whole
which
you
are
unable
to
perceive
though
nature
is
like
unto
herself
in
the
organizing
force
or
in
her
principles
which
are
infinite
she
is
not
so
in
her
finite
effects
thus
you
will
never
find
in
nature
two
objects
identically
alike
in
the
natural
order
two
and
two
never
make
four
to
do
so
four
exactly
similar
units
must
be
had
and
you
know
how
impossible
it
is
to
find
two
leaves
alike
on
the
same
tree
or
two
trees
alike
of
the
same
species
this
axiom
of
your
numeration
false
in
visible
nature
is
equally
false
in
the
invisible
universe
of
your
abstractions
where
the
same
variance
takes
place
in
your
ideas
which
are
the
things
of
the
visible
world
extended
by
means
of
their
relations
so
that
the
variations
here
are
even
more
marked
than
elsewhere
in
fact
all
being
relative
to
the
temperament
strength
habits
and
customs
of
individuals
who
never
resemble
each
other
the
smallest
objects
take
the
color
of
personal
feelings
for
instance
man
has
been
able
to
create
units
and
to
give
an
equal
weight
and
value
to
bits
of
gold
well
take
the
ducat
of
the
rich
man
and
the
ducat
of
the
poor
man
to
a
and
they
are
rated
exactly
equal
but
to
the
mind
of
the
thinker
one
is
of
greater
importance
than
the
other
one
represents
a
month
of
comfort
the
other
an
ephemeral
caprice
two
and
two
therefore
only
make
four
through
a
false
conception
again
fraction
does
not
exist
in
nature
where
what
you
call
a
fragment
is
a
finished
whole
does
it
not
often
happen
have
you
not
many
proofs
of
it
that
the
hundredth
part
of
a
substance
is
stronger
than
what
you
term
the
whole
of
it
if
fraction
does
not
exist
in
the
natural
order
still
less
shall
we
find
it
in
the
moral
order
where
ideas
and
sentiments
may
be
as
varied
as
the
species
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
and
yet
be
always
whole
the
theory
of
fractions
is
therefore
another
signal
instance
of
the
servility
of
your
mind
thus
number
with
its
infinite
minuteness
and
its
infinite
expansion
is
a
power
whose
weakest
side
is
known
to
you
but
whose
real
import
escapes
your
perception
you
have
built
yourself
a
hut
in
the
infinite
of
numbers
you
have
adorned
it
with
hieroglyphics
scientifically
arranged
and
painted
and
you
cry
out
all
is
here
let
us
pass
from
pure
unmingled
number
to
corporate
number
your
geometry
establishes
that
a
straight
line
is
the
shortest
way
from
one
point
to
another
but
your
astronomy
proves
that
god
has
proceeded
by
curves
here
then
we
find
two
truths
equally
proved
by
the
same
science
one
by
the
testimony
of
your
senses
reinforced
by
the
telescope
the
other
by
the
testimony
of
your
mind
and
yet
the
one
contradicts
the
other
man
liable
to
err
affirms
one
and
the
maker
of
the
worlds
whom
so
far
you
have
not
detected
in
error
contradicts
it
who
shall
decide
between
rectalinear
and
curvilinear
geometry
between
the
theory
of
the
straight
line
and
that
of
the
curve
if
in
his
vast
work
the
mysterious
artificer
who
knows
how
to
reach
his
ends
miraculously
fast
never
employs
a
straight
line
except
to
cut
off
an
angle
and
so
obtain
a
curve
neither
does
man
himself
always
rely
upon
it
the
bullet
which
he
aims
direct
proceeds
by
a
curve
and
when
you
wish
to
strike
a
certain
point
in
space
you
impel
your
bombshell
along
its
cruel
parabola
none
of
your
men
of
science
have
drawn
from
this
fact
the
simple
deduction
that
the
curve
is
the
law
of
the
material
worlds
and
the
straight
line
that
of
the
spiritual
worlds
one
is
the
theory
of
finite
creations
the
other
the
theory
of
the
infinite
man
who
alone
in
the
world
has
a
knowledge
of
the
infinite
can
alone
know
the
straight
line
he
alone
has
the
sense
of
verticality
placed
in
a
special
organ
a
fondness
for
the
creations
of
the
curve
would
seem
to
be
in
certain
men
an
indication
of
the
impurity
of
their
nature
still
conjoined
to
the
material
substances
which
engender
us
and
the
love
of
great
souls
for
the
straight
line
seems
to
show
in
them
an
intuition
of
heaven
between
these
two
lines
there
is
a
gulf
fixed
like
that
between
the
finite
and
the
infinite
between
matter
and
spirit
between
man
and
the
idea
between
motion
and
the
object
moved
between
the
creature
and
god
ask
love
the
divine
to
grant
you
his
wings
and
you
can
cross
that
gulf
beyond
it
begins
the
revelation
of
the
word
no
part
of
those
things
which
you
call
material
is
without
its
own
meaning
lines
are
the
boundaries
of
solid
parts
and
imply
a
force
of
action
which
you
suppress
in
your
formulas
thus
rendering
those
formulas
false
in
relation
to
substances
taken
as
a
whole
hence
the
constant
destruction
of
the
monuments
of
human
labor
which
you
supply
unknown
to
yourselves
with
acting
properties
nature
has
substances
your
science
combines
only
their
appearances
at
every
step
nature
gives
the
lie
to
all
your
laws
can
you
find
a
single
one
that
is
not
disproved
by
a
fact
your
static
laws
are
at
the
mercy
of
a
thousand
accidents
a
fluid
can
overthrow
a
solid
mountain
and
prove
that
the
heaviest
substances
may
be
lifted
by
one
that
is
imponderable
your
laws
on
acoustics
and
optics
are
defied
by
the
sounds
which
you
hear
within
yourselves
in
sleep
and
by
the
light
of
an
electric
sun
whose
rays
often
overcome
you
you
know
no
more
how
light
makes
itself
seen
within
you
than
you
know
the
simple
and
natural
process
which
changes
it
on
the
throats
of
tropic
birds
to
rubies
sapphires
emeralds
and
opals
or
keeps
it
gray
and
brown
on
the
breasts
of
the
same
birds
under
the
cloudy
skies
of
europe
or
whitens
it
here
in
the
bosom
of
our
polar
nature
you
know
not
how
to
decide
whether
color
is
a
faculty
with
which
all
substances
are
endowed
or
an
effect
produced
by
an
effluence
of
light
you
admit
the
saltness
of
the
sea
without
being
able
to
prove
that
the
water
is
salt
at
its
greatest
depth
you
recognize
the
existence
of
various
substances
which
span
what
you
think
to
be
the
void
substances
which
are
not
tangible
under
any
of
the
forms
assumed
by
matter
although
they
put
themselves
in
harmony
with
matter
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
all
this
being
so
you
believe
in
the
results
of
chemistry
although
that
science
still
knows
no
way
of
gauging
the
changes
produced
by
the
flux
and
reflux
of
substances
which
come
and
go
across
your
crystals
and
your
instruments
on
the
impalpable
filaments
of
heat
or
light
conducted
and
projected
by
the
affinities
of
metal
or
vitrified
flint
you
obtain
none
but
dead
substances
from
which
you
have
driven
the
unknown
force
that
holds
in
check
the
decomposition
of
all
things
here
below
and
of
which
cohesion
attraction
vibration
and
polarity
are
but
phenomena
life
is
the
thought
of
substances
bodies
are
only
the
means
of
fixing
life
and
holding
it
to
its
way
if
bodies
were
beings
living
of
themselves
they
would
be
cause
itself
and
could
not
die
when
a
man
discovers
the
results
of
the
general
movement
which
is
shared
by
all
creations
according
to
their
faculty
of
absorption
you
proclaim
him
mighty
in
science
as
though
genius
consisted
in
explaining
a
thing
that
is
genius
ought
to
cast
its
eyes
beyond
effects
your
men
of
science
would
laugh
if
you
said
to
them
there
exist
such
positive
relations
between
two
human
beings
one
of
whom
may
be
here
and
the
other
in
java
that
they
can
at
the
same
instant
feel
the
same
sensation
and
be
conscious
of
so
doing
they
can
question
each
other
and
reply
without
mistake
and
yet
there
are
mineral
substances
which
exhibit
sympathies
as
far
off
from
each
other
as
those
of
which
i
speak
you
believe
in
the
power
of
the
electricity
which
you
find
in
the
magnet
and
you
deny
that
which
emanates
from
the
soul
according
to
you
the
moon
whose
influence
upon
the
tides
you
think
fixed
has
none
whatever
upon
the
winds
nor
upon
navigation
nor
upon
men
she
moves
the
sea
but
she
must
not
affect
the
sick
folk
she
has
undeniable
relations
with
one
half
of
humanity
and
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
other
half
these
are
your
vaunted
certainties
let
us
go
a
step
further
you
believe
in
physics
but
your
physics
begin
like
the
catholic
religion
with
an
of
do
they
not
some
external
force
distinct
from
substance
to
which
it
communicates
motion
you
see
its
effects
but
what
is
it
where
is
it
what
is
the
essence
of
its
nature
its
life
has
it
any
limits
and
yet
you
deny
god
thus
the
majority
of
your
scientific
axioms
true
to
their
relation
to
man
are
false
in
relation
to
the
great
whole
science
is
one
but
you
have
divided
it
to
know
the
real
meaning
of
the
laws
of
phenomena
must
we
not
know
the
correlations
which
exist
between
phenomena
and
the
law
of
the
whole
there
is
in
all
things
an
appearance
which
strikes
your
senses
under
that
appearance
stirs
a
soul
a
body
is
there
and
a
faculty
is
there
where
do
you
teach
the
study
of
the
relations
which
bind
things
to
each
other
nowhere
consequently
you
have
nothing
positive
your
strongest
certainties
rest
upon
the
analysis
of
material
forms
whose
essence
you
persistently
ignore
there
is
a
higher
knowledge
of
which
too
late
some
men
obtain
a
glimpse
though
they
dare
not
avow
it
such
men
comprehend
the
necessity
of
considering
substances
not
merely
in
their
mathematical
properties
but
also
in
their
entirety
in
their
occult
relations
and
affinities
the
greatest
man
among
you
divined
in
his
latter
days
that
all
was
reciprocally
cause
and
effect
that
the
visible
worlds
were
among
themselves
and
subject
to
worlds
invisible
he
groaned
at
the
recollection
of
having
tried
to
establish
fixed
precepts
counting
up
his
worlds
like
scattered
through
ether
he
had
explained
their
coherence
by
the
laws
of
planetary
and
molecular
attraction
you
bowed
before
that
man
of
science
well
i
tell
you
that
he
died
in
despair
by
supposing
that
the
centrifugal
and
centripetal
forces
which
he
had
invented
to
explain
to
himself
the
universe
were
equal
he
stopped
the
universe
yet
he
admitted
motion
in
an
indeterminate
sense
but
supposing
those
forces
unequal
then
utter
confusion
of
the
planetary
system
ensued
his
laws
therefore
were
not
absolute
some
higher
problem
existed
than
the
principle
on
which
his
false
glory
rested
the
connection
of
the
stars
with
one
another
and
the
centripetal
action
of
their
internal
motion
did
not
deter
him
from
seeking
the
parent
stalk
on
which
his
clusters
hung
alas
poor
man
the
more
he
widened
space
the
heavier
his
burden
grew
he
told
you
how
there
came
to
be
equilibrium
among
the
parts
but
whither
went
the
whole
his
mind
contemplated
the
vast
extent
illimitable
to
human
eyes
filled
with
those
groups
of
worlds
a
mere
fraction
of
which
is
all
our
telescopes
can
reach
but
whose
immensity
is
revealed
by
the
rapidity
of
light
this
sublime
contemplation
enabled
him
to
perceive
myriads
of
worlds
planted
in
space
like
flowers
in
a
field
which
are
born
like
infants
grow
like
men
die
as
the
aged
die
and
live
by
assimilating
from
their
atmosphere
the
substances
suitable
for
their
nourishment
having
a
centre
and
a
principal
of
life
guaranteeing
to
each
other
their
circuits
absorbed
and
absorbing
like
plants
and
forming
a
vast
whole
endowed
with
life
and
possessing
a
destiny
at
that
sight
your
man
of
science
trembled
he
knew
that
life
is
produced
by
the
union
of
the
thing
and
its
principle
that
death
or
inertia
or
gravity
is
produced
by
a
rupture
between
a
thing
and
the
movement
which
appertains
to
it
then
it
was
that
he
foresaw
the
crumbling
of
the
worlds
and
their
destruction
if
god
should
withdraw
the
breath
of
his
word
he
searched
the
apocalypse
for
the
traces
of
that
word
you
thought
him
mad
understand
him
better
he
was
seeking
pardon
for
the
work
of
his
genius
wilfrid
you
have
come
here
hoping
to
make
me
solve
equations
or
rise
upon
a
or
plunge
into
the
fiord
and
reappear
a
swan
if
science
or
miracles
were
the
end
and
object
of
humanity
moses
would
have
bequeathed
to
you
the
law
of
fluxions
jesus
christ
would
have
lightened
the
darkness
of
your
sciences
his
apostles
would
have
told
you
whence
come
those
vast
trains
of
gas
and
melted
metals
attached
to
cores
which
revolve
and
solidify
as
they
dart
through
ether
or
violently
enter
some
system
and
combine
with
a
star
jostling
and
displacing
it
by
the
shock
or
destroying
it
by
the
infiltration
of
their
deadly
gases
saint
paul
instead
of
telling
you
to
live
in
god
would
have
explained
why
food
is
the
secret
bond
among
all
creations
and
the
evident
tie
between
all
living
species
in
these
days
the
greatest
miracle
of
all
would
be
the
discovery
of
the
squaring
of
the
circle
a
problem
which
you
hold
to
be
insoluble
but
which
is
doubtless
solved
in
the
march
of
worlds
by
the
intersection
of
some
mathematical
lines
whose
course
is
visible
to
the
eye
of
spirits
who
have
reached
the
higher
spheres
believe
me
miracles
are
in
us
not
without
us
here
natural
facts
occur
which
men
call
supernatural
god
would
have
been
strangely
unjust
had
he
confined
the
testimony
of
his
power
to
certain
generations
and
peoples
and
denied
them
to
others
the
brazen
rod
belongs
to
all
neither
moses
nor
jacob
nor
zoroaster
nor
paul
nor
pythagoras
nor
swedenborg
not
the
humblest
messenger
nor
the
loftiest
prophet
of
the
most
high
are
greater
than
you
are
capable
of
being
only
there
come
to
nations
as
to
men
certain
periods
when
faith
is
theirs
if
material
sciences
be
the
end
and
object
of
human
effort
tell
me
both
of
you
would
societies
those
great
centres
where
men
congregate
would
they
perpetually
be
dispersed
if
civilization
were
the
object
of
our
species
would
intelligence
perish
would
it
continue
purely
individual
the
grandeur
of
all
nations
that
were
truly
great
was
based
on
exceptions
when
the
exception
ceased
their
power
died
if
such
were
the
prophets
seers
and
messengers
of
god
would
have
lent
their
hand
to
science
rather
than
have
given
it
to
belief
surely
they
would
have
quickened
your
brains
sooner
than
have
touched
your
hearts
but
no
one
and
all
they
came
to
lead
the
nations
back
to
god
they
proclaimed
the
sacred
path
in
simple
words
that
showed
the
way
to
heaven
all
were
wrapped
in
love
and
faith
all
were
inspired
by
that
which
hovers
above
the
inhabitants
of
earth
enfolding
them
inspiriting
them
uplifting
them
none
were
prompted
by
any
human
interest
your
great
geniuses
your
poets
your
kings
your
learned
men
are
engulfed
with
their
cities
while
the
names
of
these
good
pastors
of
humanity
ever
blessed
have
survived
all
cataclysms
alas
we
can
not
understand
each
other
on
any
point
we
are
separated
by
an
abyss
you
are
on
the
side
of
darkness
while
i
i
live
in
the
light
the
true
light
is
this
the
word
that
you
ask
of
me
i
say
it
with
joy
it
may
change
you
know
this
there
are
sciences
of
matter
and
sciences
of
spirit
there
where
you
see
substances
i
see
forces
that
stretch
one
toward
another
with
generating
power
to
me
the
character
of
bodies
is
the
indication
of
their
principles
and
the
sign
of
their
properties
those
principles
beget
affinities
which
escape
your
knowledge
and
which
are
linked
to
centres
the
different
species
among
which
life
is
distributed
are
unfailing
streams
which
correspond
unfailingly
among
themselves
each
has
his
own
vocation
man
is
effect
and
cause
he
is
fed
but
he
feeds
in
turn
when
you
call
god
a
creator
you
dwarf
him
he
did
not
create
as
you
think
he
did
plants
or
animals
or
stars
could
he
proceed
by
a
variety
of
means
must
he
not
act
by
unity
of
composition
moreover
he
gave
forth
principles
to
be
developed
according
to
his
universal
law
at
the
will
of
the
surroundings
in
which
they
were
placed
hence
a
single
substance
and
motion
a
single
plant
a
single
animal
but
correlations
everywhere
in
fact
all
affinities
are
linked
together
by
contiguous
similitudes
the
life
of
the
worlds
is
drawn
toward
the
centres
by
famished
aspiration
as
you
are
drawn
by
hunger
to
seek
food
to
give
you
an
example
of
affinities
linked
to
similitudes
a
secondary
law
on
which
the
creations
of
your
thought
are
based
music
that
celestial
art
is
the
working
out
of
this
principle
for
is
it
not
a
complement
of
sounds
harmonized
by
number
is
not
sound
a
modification
of
air
compressed
dilated
echoed
you
know
the
composition
of
air
oxygen
nitrogen
and
carbon
as
you
can
not
obtain
sound
from
the
void
it
is
plain
that
music
and
the
human
voice
are
the
result
of
organized
chemical
substances
which
put
themselves
in
unison
with
the
same
substances
prepared
within
you
by
your
thought
by
means
of
light
the
great
nourisher
of
your
globe
have
you
ever
meditated
on
the
masses
of
nitre
deposited
by
the
snow
have
you
ever
observed
a
thunderstorm
and
seen
the
plants
breathing
in
from
the
air
about
them
the
metal
it
contains
without
concluding
that
the
sun
has
fused
and
distributed
the
subtle
essence
which
nourishes
all
things
here
below
swedenborg
has
said
the
earth
is
a
your
science
which
makes
you
great
in
your
own
eyes
is
paltry
indeed
beside
the
light
which
bathes
a
seer
cease
cease
to
question
me
our
languages
are
different
for
a
moment
i
have
used
yours
to
cast
if
it
be
possible
a
ray
of
faith
into
your
soul
to
give
you
as
it
were
the
hem
of
my
garment
and
draw
you
up
into
the
regions
of
prayer
can
god
abase
himself
to
you
is
it
not
for
you
to
rise
to
him
if
human
reason
finds
the
ladder
of
its
own
strength
too
weak
to
bring
god
down
to
it
is
it
not
evident
that
you
must
find
some
other
path
to
reach
him
that
path
is
in
ourselves
the
seer
and
the
believer
find
eyes
within
their
souls
more
piercing
far
than
eyes
that
probe
the
things
of
earth
they
see
the
dawn
hear
this
truth
your
science
let
it
be
never
so
exact
your
meditations
however
bold
your
noblest
lights
are
clouds
above
above
is
the
sanctuary
whence
the
true
light
she
sat
down
and
remained
silent
her
calm
face
bore
no
sign
of
the
agitation
which
orators
betray
after
their
least
fervid
improvisations
wilfrid
bent
toward
monsieur
becker
and
said
in
a
low
voice
who
taught
her
that
i
do
not
know
he
answered
he
was
gentler
on
the
falberg
minna
whispered
to
herself
seraphita
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
then
she
said
smiling
you
are
very
thoughtful
gentlemen
you
treat
minna
and
me
as
though
we
were
men
to
whom
you
must
talk
politics
or
commerce
whereas
we
are
young
girls
and
you
ought
to
tell
us
tales
while
you
drink
your
tea
that
is
what
we
do
monsieur
wilfrid
in
our
long
norwegian
evenings
come
dear
pastor
tell
me
some
saga
that
i
have
not
heard
that
of
frithiof
the
chronicle
that
you
believe
and
have
so
often
promised
me
tell
us
the
story
of
the
peasant
lad
who
owned
the
ship
that
talked
and
had
a
soul
come
i
dream
of
the
frigate
ellida
the
fairy
with
the
sails
young
girls
should
navigate
since
we
have
returned
to
the
regions
of
jarvis
said
wilfrid
whose
eyes
were
fastened
on
seraphita
as
those
of
a
robber
lurking
in
the
darkness
fasten
on
the
spot
where
he
knows
the
jewels
lie
tell
me
why
you
do
not
marry
you
are
all
born
widows
and
widowers
she
replied
but
my
marriage
was
arranged
at
my
birth
i
am
to
whom
they
cried
ask
not
my
secret
she
said
i
will
promise
if
our
father
permits
it
to
invite
you
to
these
mysterious
will
they
be
soon
i
think
a
long
silence
followed
these
words
the
spring
has
come
said
seraphita
suddenly
the
noise
of
the
waters
and
the
breaking
of
the
ice
begins
come
let
us
welcome
the
first
spring
of
the
new
she
rose
followed
by
wilfrid
and
together
they
went
to
a
window
which
david
had
opened
after
the
long
silence
of
winter
the
waters
stirred
beneath
the
ice
and
resounded
through
the
fiord
like
music
for
there
are
sounds
which
space
refines
so
that
they
reach
the
ear
in
waves
of
light
and
freshness
wilfrid
cease
to
nourish
evil
thoughts
whose
triumph
would
be
hard
to
bear
your
desires
are
easily
read
in
the
fire
of
your
eyes
be
kind
take
one
step
forward
in
advance
beyond
the
love
of
man
and
sacrifice
yourself
completely
to
the
happiness
of
her
you
love
obey
me
i
will
lead
you
in
a
path
where
you
shall
obtain
the
distinctions
which
you
crave
and
where
love
is
infinite
she
left
him
thoughtful
that
soft
creature
he
said
within
himself
is
she
indeed
the
prophetess
whose
eyes
have
just
flashed
lightnings
whose
voice
has
rung
through
worlds
whose
hand
has
wielded
the
axe
of
doubt
against
our
sciences
have
we
been
dreaming
am
i
awake
minna
said
seraphita
returning
to
the
young
girl
the
eagle
swoops
where
the
carrion
lies
but
the
dove
seeks
the
mountain
spring
beneath
the
peaceful
greenery
of
the
glades
the
eagle
soars
to
heaven
the
dove
descends
from
it
cease
to
venture
into
regions
where
thou
canst
find
no
spring
of
waters
no
umbrageous
shade
if
on
the
falberg
thou
couldst
not
gaze
into
the
abyss
and
live
keep
all
thy
strength
for
him
who
will
love
thee
go
poor
girl
thou
knowest
i
am
minna
rose
and
followed
seraphita
to
the
window
where
wilfrid
stood
all
three
listened
to
the
sieg
bounding
out
the
rush
of
the
upper
waters
which
brought
down
trees
uprooted
by
the
ice
the
fiord
had
regained
its
voice
all
illusions
were
dispelled
they
rejoiced
in
nature
as
she
burst
her
bonds
and
seemed
to
answer
with
sublime
accord
to
the
spirit
whose
breath
had
wakened
her
when
the
three
guests
of
this
mysterious
being
left
the
house
they
were
filled
with
the
vague
sensation
which
is
neither
sleep
nor
torpor
nor
astonishment
but
partakes
of
the
nature
of
each
a
state
that
is
neither
dusk
nor
dawn
but
which
creates
a
thirst
for
light
all
three
were
thinking
i
begin
to
believe
that
she
is
indeed
a
spirit
hidden
in
human
form
said
monsieur
becker
wilfrid
his
own
apartments
calm
and
convinced
was
unable
to
struggle
against
that
influence
so
divinely
majestic
minna
said
in
her
heart
why
will
he
not
let
me
love
him
chapter
farewell
there
is
in
man
an
almost
hopeless
phenomenon
for
thoughtful
minds
who
seek
a
meaning
in
the
march
of
civilization
and
who
endeavor
to
give
laws
of
progression
to
the
movement
of
intelligence
however
portentous
a
fact
may
be
or
even
supernatural
if
such
facts
exist
however
solemnly
a
miracle
may
be
done
in
sight
of
all
the
lightning
of
that
fact
the
thunderbolt
of
that
miracle
is
quickly
swallowed
up
in
the
ocean
of
life
whose
surface
scarcely
stirred
by
the
brief
convulsion
returns
to
the
level
of
its
habitual
flow
a
voice
is
heard
from
the
jaws
of
an
animal
a
hand
writes
on
the
wall
before
a
feasting
court
an
eye
gleams
in
the
slumber
of
a
king
and
a
prophet

at
the
foot
of
that
mystic
ladder
of
the
seven
spiritual
worlds
one
resting
upon
another
in
space
and
revealing
themselves
in
shining
waves
that
break
in
light
upon
the
steps
of
the
celestial
tabernacle
but
however
solemn
the
inward
revelation
however

the

twenty
centuries

ratifies
his

his

why
this
that
the

as
they
have
ever

as
they

in

as
they
lived
on
the
morrow
of
creation
and
on
the
eve
of
the
great
cataclysm
the
waves
of
doubt
have
covered
all
things
the
same
floods
surge
with
the
same
measured
motion
on
the
human
granite
which
serves
as
a
boundary
to
the
ocean
of
intelligence
when
man
has
inquired
of
himself
whether
he
has
seen
that
which
he
has
seen
whether
he
has
heard
the
words
that
entered
his
ears
whether
the
facts
were
facts
and
the
idea
is
indeed
an
idea
then
he
resumes
his
wonted
bearing
thinks
of
his
worldly
interests
obeys
some
envoy
of
death
and
of
oblivion
whose
dusky
mantle
covers
like
a
pall
an
ancient
humanity
of
which
the
moderns
retain
no
memory
man
never
pauses
he
goes
his
round
he
vegetates
until
the
appointed
day
when
his
axe
falls
if
this
wave
force
this
pressure
of
bitter
waters
prevents
all
progress
no
doubt
it
also
warns
of
death
spirits
prepared
by
faith
among
the
higher
souls
of
earth
can
alone
perceive
the
mystic
ladder
of
jacob
after
listening
to
seraphita
s
answer
in
which
being
earnestly
questioned
she
unrolled
before
their
eyes
a
divine
perspective
as
an
organ
fills
a
church
with
sonorous
sound
and
reveals
a
musical
universe
its
solemn
tones
rising
to
the
loftiest
arches
and
playing
like
light
upon
their
foliated
capitals
wilfrid
returned
to
his
own
room
awed
by
the
sight
of
a
world
in
ruins
and
on
those
ruins
the
brilliance
of
mysterious
lights
poured
forth
in
torrents
by
the
hand
of
a
young
girl
on
the
morrow
he
still
thought
of
these
things
but
his
awe
was
gone
he
felt
he
was
neither
destroyed
nor
changed
his
passions
his
ideas
awoke
in
full
force
fresh
and
vigorous
he
went
to
breakfast
with
monsieur
becker
and
found
the
old
man
absorbed
in
the
treatise
on
incantations
which
he
had
searched
since
early
morning
to
convince
his
guest
that
there
was
nothing
unprecedented
in
all
that
they
had
seen
and
heard
at
the
swedish
castle
with
the
childlike
trustfulness
of
a
true
scholar
he
had
folded
down
the
pages
in
which
jean
wier
related
authentic
facts
which
proved
the
possibility
of
the
events
that
had
happened
the
night
before
for
to
learned
men
an
idea
is
a
event
just
as
the
greatest
events
often
present
no
idea
at
all
to
them
by
the
time
they
had
swallowed
their
fifth
cup
of
tea
these
philosophers
had
come
to
think
the
mysterious
scene
of
the
preceding
evening
wholly
natural
the
celestial
truths
to
which
they
had
listened
were
arguments
susceptible
of
examination
seraphita
was
a
girl
more
or
less
eloquent
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
charms
of
her
voice
her
seductive
beauty
her
fascinating
motions
in
short
for
all
those
oratorical
arts
by
which
an
actor
puts
a
world
of
sentiment
and
thought
into
phrases
which
are
often
commonplace
bah
said
the
worthy
pastor
making
a
philosophical
grimace
as
he
spread
a
layer
of
salt
butter
on
his
slice
of
bread
the
final
word
of
all
these
fine
enigmas
is
six
feet
under
but
said
wilfrid
sugaring
his
tea
i
can
not
image
how
a
young
girl
of
seventeen
can
know
so
much
what
she
said
was
certainly
a
compact
read
the
account
of
that
italian
woman
said
monsieur
becker
who
at
the
age
of
twelve
spoke
languages
ancient
and
modern
also
the
history
of
that
monk
who
could
guess
thought
by
smell
i
can
give
you
a
thousand
such
cases
from
jean
wier
and
other
i
admit
all
that
dear
pastor
but
to
my
thinking
seraphita
would
make
a
perfect
she
is
all
mind
said
monsieur
becker
dubiously
several
days
went
by
during
which
the
snow
in
the
valleys
melted
gradually
away
the
green
of
the
forests
and
of
the
grass
began
to
show
norwegian
nature
made
ready
her
wedding
garments
for
her
brief
bridal
of
a
day
during
this
period
when
the
softened
air
invited
every
one
to
leave
the
house
seraphita
remained
at
home
in
solitude
when
at
last
she
admitted
minna
the
latter
saw
at
once
the
ravages
of
inward
fever
seraphita
s
voice
was
hollow
her
skin
pallid
hitherto
a
poet
might
have
compared
her
lustre
to
that
of
diamonds
now
it
was
that
of
a
topaz
have
you
seen
her
asked
wilfrid
who
had
wandered
around
the
swedish
dwelling
waiting
for
minna
s
return
yes
answered
the
young
girl
weeping
we
must
lose
him
mademoiselle
cried
wilfrid
endeavoring
to
repress
the
loud
tones
of
his
angry
voice
do
not
jest
with
me
you
can
love
seraphita
only
as
one
young
girl
can
love
another
and
not
with
the
love
which
she
inspires
in
me
you
do
not
know
your
danger
if
my
jealousy
were
really
aroused
why
can
i
not
go
to
her
is
it
you
who
stand
in
my
way
i
do
not
know
by
what
right
you
probe
my
heart
said
minna
calm
in
appearance
but
inwardly
terrified
yes
i
love
him
she
said
recovering
the
courage
of
her
convictions
that
she
might
for
once
confess
the
religion
of
her
heart
but
my
jealousy
natural
as
it
is
in
love
fears
no
one
here
below
alas
i
am
jealous
of
a
secret
feeling
that
absorbs
him
between
him
and
me
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
which
i
can
not
cross
would
that
i
knew
who
loves
him
best
the
stars
or
i
which
of
us
would
sacrifice
our
being
most
eagerly
for
his
happiness
why
should
i
not
be
free
to
avow
my
love
in
the
presence
of
death
we
may
declare
our
feelings
and
seraphitus
is
about
to
minna
you
are
mistaken
the
siren
i
so
love
and
long
for
she
whom
i
have
seen
feeble
and
languid
on
her
couch
of
furs
is
not
a
young
monsieur
answered
minna
distressfully
the
being
whose
powerful
hand
guided
me
on
the
falberg
who
led
me
to
the
saeter
sheltered
beneath
the
there
she
said
pointing
to
the
peak
is
not
a
feeble
girl
ah
had
you
but
heard
him
prophesying
his
poem
was
the
music
of
thought
a
young
girl
never
uttered
those
solemn
tones
of
a
voice
which
stirred
my
what
certainty
have
you
said
wilfrid
none
but
that
of
the
heart
answered
minna
and
i
cried
wilfrid
casting
on
his
companion
the
terrible
glance
of
the
earthly
desire
that
kills
i
too
know
how
powerful
is
her
empire
over
me
and
i
will
undeceive
at
this
moment
while
the
words
were
rushing
from
wilfrid
s
lips
as
rapidly
as
the
thoughts
surged
in
his
brain
they
saw
seraphita
coming
towards
them
from
the
house
followed
by
david
the
apparition
calmed
the
man
s
excitement
look
he
said
could
any
but
a
woman
move
with
that
grace
and
langor
he
suffers
he
comes
forth
for
the
last
time
said
minna
david
went
back
at
a
sign
from
his
mistress
who
advanced
towards
wilfrid
and
minna
let
us
go
to
the
falls
of
the
sieg
she
said
expressing
one
of
those
desires
which
suddenly
possess
the
sick
and
which
the
well
hasten
to
obey
a
thin
white
mist
covered
the
valleys
around
the
fiord
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
whose
icy
summits
sparkling
like
stars
pierced
the
vapor
and
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
moving
milky
way
the
sun
was
visible
through
the
haze
like
a
globe
of
red
fire
though
winter
still
lingered
puffs
of
warm
air
laden
with
the
scent
of
the
already
adorned
with
their
rosy
efflorescence
and
of
the
larches
whose
silken
tassels
were
beginning
to
appear
breezes
tempered
by
the
incense
and
the
sighs
of
earth
gave
token
of
the
glorious
northern
spring
the
rapid
fleeting
joy
of
that
most
melancholy
of
natures
the
wind
was
beginning
to
lift
the
veil
of
mist
which
the
gulf
the
birds
sang
the
bark
of
the
trees
where
the
sun
had
not
yet
dried
the
clinging
shone
gayly
to
the
eye
in
its
fantastic
wreathings
which
trickled
away
in
murmuring
rivulets
as
the
warmth
reached
them
the
three
friends
walked
in
silence
along
the
shore
wilfrid
and
minna
alone
noticed
the
magic
transformation
that
was
taking
place
in
the
monotonous
picture
of
the
winter
landscape
their
companion
walked
in
thought
as
though
a
voice
were
sounding
to
her
ears
in
this
concert
of
nature
presently
they
reached
the
ledge
of
rocks
through
which
the
sieg
had
forced
its
way
after
escaping
from
the
long
avenue
cut
by
its
waters
in
an
undulating
line
through
the
forest
a
fluvial
pathway
flanked
by
aged
firs
and
roofed
with
arches
like
those
of
a
cathedral
looking
back
from
that
the
whole
extent
of
the
fiord
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
with
the
open
sea
sparkling
on
the
horizon
beyond
it
like
a
burnished
blade
at
this
moment
the
mist
rolling
away
left
the
sky
blue
and
clear
among
the
valleys
and
around
the
trees
flitted
the
shining
fragments
a
diamond
dust
swept
by
the
freshening
breeze
the
torrent
rolled
on
toward
them
along
its
length
a
vapor
rose
tinted
by
the
sun
with
every
color
of
his
light
the
decomposing
rays
flashing
prismatic
fires
along
the
scarf
of
waters
the
rugged
ledge
on
which
they
stood
was
carpeted
by
several
kinds
of
lichen
forming
a
noble
mat
variegated
by
moisture
and
lustrous
like
the
sheen
of
a
silken
fabric
shrubs
already
in
bloom
crowned
the
rocks
with
garlands
their
waving
foliage
eager
for
the
freshness
of
the
water
drooped
its
tresses
above
the
stream
the
larches
shook
their
light
fringes
and
played
with
the
pines
stiff
and
motionless
as
aged
men
this
luxuriant
beauty
was
foiled
by
the
solemn
colonnades
of
the
rising
in
terraces
upon
the
mountains
and
by
the
calm
sheet
of
the
fiord
lying
below
where
the
torrent
buried
its
fury
and
was
still
beyond
the
sea
hemmed
in
this
page
of
nature
written
by
the
greatest
of
poets
chance
to
whom
the
wild
luxuriance
of
creation
when
apparently
abandoned
to
itself
is
owing
the
village
of
jarvis
was
a
lost
point
in
the
landscape
in
this
immensity
of
nature
sublime
at
this
moment
like
all
things
else
of
ephemeral
life
which
present
a
fleeting
image
of
perfection
for
by
a
law
fatal
to
no
eyes
but
our
own
creations
which
appear
complete
the
love
of
our
heart
and
the
desire
of
our
eyes
have
but
one
here
below
standing
on
this
of
rock
these
three
persons
might
well
suppose
themselves
alone
in
the
universe
what
beauty
cried
wilfrid
nature
sings
hymns
said
seraphita
is
not
her
music
exquisite
tell
me
wilfrid
could
any
of
the
women
you
once
knew
create
such
a
glorious
retreat
for
herself
as
this
i
am
conscious
here
of
a
feeling
seldom
inspired
by
the
sight
of
cities
a
longing
to
lie
down
amid
this
quickening
verdure
here
with
eyes
to
heaven
and
an
open
heart
lost
in
the
bosom
of
immensity
i
could
hear
the
sighings
of
the
flower
scarce
budded
which
longs
for
wings
or
the
cry
of
the
eider
grieving
that
it
can
only
fly
and
remember
the
desires
of
man
who
issuing
from
all
is
none
the
less
ever
longing
but
that
wilfrid
is
only
a
woman
s
thought
you
find
seductive
fancies
in
the
wreathing
mists
the
light
embroidered
veils
which
nature
dons
like
a
coy
maiden
in
this
atmosphere
where
she
perfumes
for
her
spousals
the
greenery
of
her
tresses
you
seek
the
naiad
s
form
amid
the
gauzy
vapors
and
to
your
thinking
my
ears
should
listen
only
to
the
virile
voice
of
the
but
love
is
there
like
the
bee
in
the
calyx
of
the
flower
replied
wilfrid
perceiving
for
the
first
time
a
trace
of
earthly
sentiment
in
her
words
and
fancying
the
moment
favorable
for
an
expression
of
his
passionate
tenderness
always
there
said
seraphita
smiling
minna
had
left
them
for
a
moment
to
gather
the
blue
saxifrages
growing
on
a
rock
above
always
repeated
wilfrid
hear
me
he
said
with
a
masterful
glance
which
was
foiled
as
by
a
diamond
you
know
not
what
i
am
nor
what
i
can
be
nor
what
i
will
do
not
reject
my
last
entreaty
be
mine
for
the
good
of
that
world
whose
happiness
you
bear
upon
your
heart
be
mine
that
my
conscience
may
be
pure
that
a
voice
divine
may
sound
in
my
ears
and
infuse
good
into
the
great
enterprise
i
have
undertaken
prompted
by
my
hatred
to
the
nations
but
which
i
swear
to
accomplish
for
their
benefit
if
you
will
walk
beside
me
what
higher
mission
can
you
ask
for
love
what
nobler
part
can
woman
aspire
to
i
came
to
norway
to
meditate
a
grand
and
you
will
sacrifice
its
grandeur
she
said
to
an
innocent
girl
who
loves
you
and
who
will
lead
you
in
the
paths
of
what
matters
sacrifice
he
cried
if
i
have
you
hear
my
secret
i
have
gone
from
end
to
end
of
the
north
that
great
smithy
from
whose
anvils
new
races
have
spread
over
the
earth
like
human
tides
appointed
to
refresh
the
wornout
civilizations
i
wished
to
begin
my
work
at
some
northern
point
to
win
the
empire
which
force
and
intellect
must
ever
give
over
a
primitive
people
to
form
that
people
for
battle
to
drive
them
to
wars
which
should
ravage
europe
like
a
conflagration
crying
liberty
to
some
pillage
to
others
glory
here
pleasure
there
i
myself
remaining
an
image
of
destiny
cruel
implacable
advancing
like
the
whirlwind
which
sucks
from
the
atmosphere
the
particles
that
make
the
thunderbolt
and
falls
like
a
devouring
scourge
upon
the
nations
europe
is
at
an
epoch
when
she
awaits
the
new
messiah
who
shall
destroy
society
and
remake
it
she
can
no
longer
believe
except
in
him
who
crushes
her
under
foot
the
day
is
at
hand
when
poets
and
historians
will
justify
me
exalt
me
and
borrow
my
ideas
mine
and
all
the
while
my
triumph
will
be
a
jest
written
in
blood
the
jest
of
my
vengeance
but
not
here
seraphita
what
i
see
in
the
north
disgusts
me
hers
is
a
mere
blind
force
i
thirst
for
the
indies
i
would
rather
fight
a
selfish
cowardly
mercantile
government
besides
it
is
easier
to
stir
the
imagination
of
the
peoples
at
the
feet
of
the
caucasus
than
to
argue
with
the
intellect
of
the
icy
lands
which
here
surround
me
therefore
am
i
tempted
to
cross
the
russian
steps
and
pour
my
triumphant
human
tide
through
asia
to
the
ganges
and
overthrow
the
british
rule
seven
men
have
done
this
thing
before
me
in
other
epochs
of
the
world
i
will
emulate
them
i
will
spread
art
like
the
saracens
hurled
by
mohammed
upon
europe
mine
shall
be
no
paltry
sovereignty
like
those
that
govern
the
ancient
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
disputing
with
their
subjects
about
a
customs
right
no
nothing
can
bar
my
way
like
genghis
khan
my
feet
shall
tread
a
third
of
the
globe
my
hand
shall
grasp
the
throat
of
asia
like
be
my
companion
let
me
seat
thee
beautiful
and
noble
being
on
a
throne
i
do
not
doubt
success
but
live
within
my
heart
and
i
am
sure
of
i
have
already
reigned
said
seraphita
coldly
the
words
fell
as
the
axe
of
a
skilful
woodman
falls
at
the
root
of
a
young
tree
and
brings
it
down
at
a
single
blow
men
alone
can
comprehend
the
rage
that
a
woman
excites
in
the
soul
of
a
man
when
after
showing
her
his
strength
his
power
his
wisdom
his
superiority
the
capricious
creature
bends
her
head
and
says
all
that
is
nothing
when
unmoved
she
smiles
and
says
such
things
are
known
to
me
as
though
his
power
were
nought
what
cried
wilfrid
in
despair
can
the
riches
of
art
the
riches
of
worlds
the
splendors
of
a
court
she
stopped
him
by
a
single
inflexion
of
her
lips
and
said
beings
more
powerful
than
you
have
offered
me
far
thou
hast
no
soul
he
cried
no
soul
if
thou
art
not
persuaded
by
the
thought
of
comforting
a
great
man
who
is
willing
now
to
sacrifice
all
things
to
live
beside
thee
in
a
little
house
on
the
shores
of
a
but
she
said
i
am
loved
with
a
boundless
by
whom
cried
wilfrid
approaching
seraphita
with
a
frenzied
movement
as
if
to
fling
her
into
the
foaming
basin
of
the
sieg
she
looked
at
him
and
slowly
extended
her
arm
pointing
to
minna
who
now
sprang
towards
her
fair
and
glowing
and
lovely
as
the
flowers
she
held
in
her
hand
child
said
seraphitus
advancing
to
meet
her
wilfrid
remained
where
she
left
him
motionless
as
the
rock
on
which
he
stood
lost
in
thought
longing
to
let
himself
go
into
the
torrent
of
the
sieg
like
the
fallen
trees
which
hurried
past
his
eyes
and
disappeared
in
the
bosom
of
the
gulf
i
gathered
them
for
you
said
minna
offering
the
bunch
of
saxifrages
to
the
being
she
adored
one
of
them
see
this
one
she
added
selecting
a
flower
is
like
that
you
found
on
the
seraphitus
looked
alternately
at
the
flower
and
at
minna
why
question
me
dost
thou
doubt
me
no
said
the
young
girl
my
trust
in
you
is
infinite
you
are
more
beautiful
to
look
upon
than
this
glorious
nature
but
your
mind
surpasses
in
intellect
that
of
all
humanity
when
i
have
been
with
you
i
seem
to
have
prayed
to
god
i
long
for
what
said
seraphitus
with
a
glance
that
revealed
to
the
young
girl
the
vast
distance
which
separated
them
to
suffer
in
your
ah
dangerous
being
cried
seraphitus
in
his
heart
is
it
wrong
oh
my
god
to
desire
to
offer
her
to
thee
dost
thou
remember
minna
what
i
said
to
thee
up
there
he
added
pointing
to
the
summit
of
the
he
is
terrible
again
thought
minna
trembling
with
fear
the
voice
of
the
sieg
accompanied
the
thoughts
of
the
three
beings
united
on
this
platform
of
projecting
rock
but
separated
in
soul
by
the
abysses
of
the
spiritual
world
seraphitus
teach
me
said
minna
in
a
silvery
voice
soft
as
the
motion
of
a
sensitive
plant
teach
me
how
to
cease
to
love
you
who
could
fail
to
admire
you
love
is
an
admiration
that
never
poor
child
said
seraphitus
turning
pale
there
is
but
one
whom
thou
canst
love
in
that
who
asked
minna
thou
shalt
know
hereafter
he
said
in
the
feeble
voice
of
a
man
who
lies
down
to
die
help
help
he
is
dying
cried
minna
wilfrid
ran
towards
them
seeing
seraphita
as
she
lay
on
a
fragment
of
gneiss
where
time
had
cast
its
velvet
mantle
of
lustrous
lichen
and
tawny
mosses
now
burnished
in
the
sunlight
he
whispered
softly
how
beautiful
she
is
one
other
look
the
last
that
i
shall
ever
cast
upon
this
nature
in
travail
said
seraphitus
rallying
her
strength
and
rising
to
her
feet
she
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
rocky
platform
whence
her
eyes
took
in
the
scenery
of
that
grand
and
glorious
landscape
so
verdant
flowery
and
animated
yet
so
lately
buried
in
its
of
snow
farewell
she
said
farewell
home
of
earth
warmed
by
the
fires
of
love
where
all
things
press
with
ardent
force
from
the
centre
to
the
extremities
where
the
extremities
are
gathered
up
like
a
woman
s
hair
to
weave
the
mysterious
braid
which
binds
us
in
that
invisible
ether
to
the
thought
divine
behold
the
man
bending
above
that
furrow
moistened
with
his
tears
who
lifts
his
head
for
an
instant
to
question
heaven
behold
the
woman
gathering
her
children
that
she
may
feed
them
with
her
milk
see
him
who
lashes
the
ropes
in
the
height
of
the
gale
see
her
who
sits
in
the
hollow
of
the
rocks
awaiting
the
father
behold
all
they
who
stretch
their
hands
in
want
after
a
lifetime
spent
in
thankless
toil
to
all
peace
and
courage
and
to
all
farewell
hear
you
the
cry
of

of

neglected
and

the
sigh
of
the

to
whom
enlightenment
comes
too
late
i
see
the
angelic
choir
the
wafting
of
perfumes
the
incense
of
the
heart
of
those
who
go

broken
with
fatigue
this
inexplicable
being
leaned
for
the
first
time
on
wilfrid
and
on
minna
to
be
taken
home
wilfrid
and
minna
felt
the
shock
of
a
mysterious
contact
in
and
through
the
being
who
thus
connected
them
they
had
scarcely
advanced
a
few
steps
when
david
met
them
weeping
she
will
die
he
said
why
have
you
brought
her
hither
the
old
man
raised
her
in
his
arms
with
the
vigor
of
youth
and
bore
her
to
the
gate
of
the
swedish
castle
like
an
eagle
bearing
a
white
lamb
to
his
mountain

chapter
vi
the
path
to
heaven
the
day
succeeding
that
on
which
seraphita
foresaw
her
death
and
bade
farewell
to
earth
as
a
prisoner
looks
round
his
dungeon
before
leaving
it
forever
she
suffered
pains
which
obliged
her
to
remain
in
the
helpless
immobility
of
those
whose
pangs
are
great
wilfrid
and
minna
went
to
see
her
and
found
her
lying
on
her
couch
of
furs
still
veiled
in
flesh
her
soul
shone
through
that
veil
which
grew
more
and
more
transparent
day
by
day
the
progress
of
the
spirit
piercing
the
last
obstacle
between
itself
and
the
infinite
was
called
an
illness
the
hour
of
life
went
by
the
name
of
death
david
wept
as
he
watched
her
sufferings
unreasonable
as
a
child
he
would
not
listen
to
his
mistress
s
consolations
monsieur
becker
wished
seraphita
to
try
remedies
but
all
were
useless
one
morning
she
sent
for
the
two
beings
whom
she
loved
telling
them
that
this
would
be
the
last
of
her
bad
days
wilfrid
and
minna
came
in
terror
knowing
well
that
they
were
about
to
lose
her
seraphita
smiled
to
them
as
one
departing
to
a
better
world
her
head
drooped
like
a
flower
heavy
with
dew
which
opens
its
calyx
for
the
last
time
to
waft
its
fragrance
on
the
breeze
she
looked
at
these
friends
with
a
sadness
that
was
for
them
not
for
herself
she
thought
no
longer
of
herself
and
they
felt
this
with
a
grief
mingled
with
gratitude
which
they
were
unable
to
express
wilfrid
stood
silent
and
motionless
lost
in
thoughts
excited
by
events
whose
vast
bearings
enabled
him
to
conceive
of
some
illimitable
immensity
emboldened
by
the
weakness
of
the
being
lately
so
powerful
or
perhaps
by
the
fear
of
losing
him
forever
minna
bent
down
over
the
couch
and
said
seraphitus
let
me
follow
thee
can
i
forbid
thee
why
will
thou
not
love
me
enough
to
stay
with
me
i
can
love
nothing
what
canst
thou
love
is
it
worthy
of
heaven
to
despise
the
creatures
of
god
minna
can
we
love
two
beings
at
once
would
our
beloved
be
indeed
our
beloved
if
he
did
not
fill
our
hearts
must
he
not
be
the
first
the
last
the
only
one
she
who
is
all
love
must
she
not
leave
the
world
for
her
beloved
human
ties
are
but
a
memory
she
has
no
ties
except
to
him
her
soul
is
hers
no
longer
it
is
his
if
she
keeps
within
her
soul
anything
that
is
not
his
does
she
love
no
she
loves
not
to
love
feebly
is
that
to
love
at
all
the
voice
of
her
beloved
makes
her
joyful
it
flows
through
her
veins
in
a
crimson
tide
more
glowing
far
than
blood
his
glance
is
the
light
that
penetrates
her
her
being
melts
into
his
being
he
is
warm
to
her
soul
he
is
the
light
that
lightens
near
to
him
there
is
neither
cold
nor
darkness
he
is
never
absent
he
is
always
with
us
we
think
in
him
to
him
by
him
minna
that
is
how
i
love
love
whom
said
minna
tortured
with
sudden
jealousy
god
replied
seraphitus
his
voice
glowing
in
their
souls
like
fires
of
liberty
from
peak
to
peak
upon
the
mountains
god
who
does
not
betray
us
god
who
will
never
abandon
us
who
crowns
our
wishes
who
satisfies
his
creatures
with
joy
joy
unalloyed
and
infinite
god
who
never
wearies
but
ever
smiles
god
who
pours
into
the
soul
fresh
treasures
day
by
day
who
purifies
and
leaves
no
bitterness
who
is
all
harmony
all
flame
god
who
has
placed
himself
within
our
hearts
to
blossom
there
who
hearkens
to
our
prayers
who
does
not
stand
aloof
when
we
are
his
but
gives
his
presence
absolutely
he
who
revives
us
magnifies
us
and
multiplies
us
in
himself
minna
i
love
thee
because
thou
mayst
be
his
i
love
thee
because
if
thou
come
to
him
thou
wilt
be
lead
me
to
him
cried
minna
kneeling
down
take
me
by
the
hand
i
will
not
leave
thee
lead
us
seraphita
cried
wilfrid
coming
to
minna
s
side
with
an
impetuous
movement
yes
thou
hast
given
me
a
thirst
for
light
a
thirst
for
the
word
i
am
parched
with
the
love
thou
hast
put
into
my
heart
i
desire
to
keep
thy
soul
in
mine
thy
will
is
mine
i
will
do
whatsoever
thou
biddest
me
since
i
can
not
obtain
thee
i
will
keep
thy
will
and
all
the
thoughts
that
thou
hast
given
me
if
i
may
not
unite
myself
with
thee
except
by
the
power
of
my
spirit
i
will
cling
to
thee
in
soul
as
the
flame
to
what
it
laps
speak
angel
exclaimed
the
mysterious
being
enfolding
them
both
in
one
glance
as
it
were
with
an
azure
mantle
heaven
shall
by
thine
heritage
silence
fell
among
them
after
these
words
which
sounded
in
the
souls
of
the
man
and
of
the
woman
like
the
first
notes
of
some
celestial
harmony
if
you
would
teach
your
feet
to
tread
the
path
to
heaven
know
that
the
way
is
hard
at
first
said
the
weary
sufferer
god
wills
that
you
shall
seek
him
for
himself
in
that
sense
he
is
jealous
he
demands
your
whole
self
but
when
you
have
given
him
yourself
never
never
will
he
abandon
you
i
leave
with
you
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
his
light
where
evermore
you
shall
dwell
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
in
the
heart
of
the
bridegroom
no
sentinels
guard
the
approaches
you
may
enter
where
you
will
his
palaces
his
treasures
his
sceptre
all
are
free
take
them
he
says
but
you
must
to
go
there
like
one
preparing
for
a
journey
a
man
must
leave
his
home
renounce
his
projects
bid
farewell
to
friends
to
father
mother
sister
even
to
the
helpless
brother
who
cries
after
him
yes
farewell
to
them
eternally
you
will
no
more
return
than
did
the
martyrs
on
their
way
to
the
stake
you
must
strip
yourself
of
every
sentiment
of
everything
to
which
man
clings
unless
you
do
this
you
are
but
in
your
enterprise
do
for
god
what
you
do
for
your
ambitious
projects
what
you
do
in
consecrating
yourself
to
art
what
you
have
done
when
you
loved
a
human
creature
or
sought
some
secret
of
human
science
is
not
god
the
whole
of
science
the
all
of
love
the
source
of
poetry
surely
his
riches
are
worthy
of
being
coveted
his
treasure
is
inexhaustible
his
poem
infinite
his
love
immutable
his
science
sure
and
darkened
by
no
mysteries
be
anxious
for
nothing
he
will
give
you
all
yes
in
his
heart
are
treasures
with
which
the
petty
joys
you
lose
on
earth
are
not
to
be
compared
what
i
tell
you
is
true
you
shall
possess
his
power
you
may
use
it
as
you
would
use
the
gifts
of
lover
or
mistress
alas
men
doubt
they
lack
faith
and
will
and
persistence
if
some
set
their
feet
in
the
path
they
look
behind
them
and
presently
turn
back
few
decide
between
the
two
extremes
to
go
or
stay
heaven
or
the
mire
all
hesitate
weakness
leads
astray
passion
allures
into
dangerous
paths
vice
becomes
habitual
man
flounders
in
the
mud
and
makes
no
progress
towards
a
better
state
all
human
beings
go
through
a
previous
life
in
the
sphere
of
instinct
where
they
are
brought
to
see
the
worthlessness
of
earthly
treasures
to
amass
which
they
gave
themselves
such
untold
pains
who
can
tell
how
many
times
the
human
being
lives
in
the
sphere
of
instinct
before
he
is
prepared
to
enter
the
sphere
of
abstractions
where
thought
expends
itself
on
erring
science
where
mind
wearies
at
last
of
human
language
for
when
matter
is
exhausted
spirit
enters
who
knows
how
many
fleshly
forms
the
heir
of
heaven
occupies
before
he
can
be
brought
to
understand
the
value
of
that
silence
and
solitude
whose
starry
plains
are
but
the
vestibule
of
spiritual
worlds
he
feels
his
way
amid
the
void
makes
trial
of
nothingness
and
then
at
last
his
eyes
revert
upon
the
path
then
follow
other
existences
all
to
be
lived
to
reach
the
place
where
light
effulgent
shines
death
is
the
of
the
journey
a
lifetime
may
be
needed
merely
to
gain
the
virtues
which
annul
the
errors
of
man
s
preceding
life
first
comes
the
life
of
suffering
whose
tortures
create
a
thirst
for
love
next
the
life
of
love
and
devotion
to
the
creature
teaching
devotion
to
the
creator
a
life
where
the
virtues
of
love
its
martyrdoms
its
joys
followed
by
sorrows
its
angelic
hopes
its
patience
its
resignation
excite
an
appetite
for
things
divine
then
follows
the
life
which
seeks
in
silence
the
traces
of
the
word
in
which
the
soul
grows
humble
and
charitable
next
the
life
of
longing
and
lastly
the
life
of
prayer
in
that
is
the
noonday
sun
there
are
the
flowers
there
the
harvest
the
virtues
we
acquire
which
develop
slowly
within
us
are
the
invisible
links
that
bind
each
one
of
our
existences
to
the
others
existences
which
the
spirit
alone
remembers
for
matter
has
no
memory
for
spiritual
things
thought
alone
holds
the
tradition
of
the
bygone
life
the
endless
legacy
of
the
past
to
the
present
is
the
secret
source
of
human
genius
some
receive
the
gift
of
form
some
the
gift
of
numbers
others
the
gift
of
harmony
all
these
gifts
are
steps
of
progress
in
the
path
of
light
yes
he
who
possesses
a
single
one
of
them
touches
at
that
point
the
infinite
earth
has
divided
the
word
of
which
i
here
reveal
some
syllables
into
particles
she
has
reduced
it
to
dust
and
has
scattered
it
through
her
works
her
dogmas
her
poems
if
some
impalpable
grain
shines
like
a
diamond
in
a
human
work
men
cry
how
grand
how
true
how
glorious
that
fragment
vibrates
in
their
souls
and
wakes
a
presentiment
of
heaven
to
some
a
melody
that
weans
from
earth
to
others
the
solitude
that
draws
to
god
to
all
whatsoever
sends
us
back
upon
ourselves
whatsoever
strikes
us
down
and
crushes
us
lifts
or
abases
us
is
but
a
syllable
of
the
divine
word
when
a
human
soul
draws
its
first
furrow
straight
the
rest
will
follow
surely
one
thought
borne
inward
one
prayer
uplifted
one
suffering
endured
one
echo
of
the
word
within
us
and
our
souls
are
forever
changed
all
ends
in
god
and
many
are
the
ways
to
find
him
by
walking
straight
before
us
when
the
happy
day
arrives
in
which
you
set
your
feet
upon
the
path
and
begin
your
pilgrimage
the
world
will
know
nothing
of
it
earth
no
longer
understands
you
you
no
longer
understand
each
other
men
who
attain
a
knowledge
of
these
things
who
lisp
a
few
syllables
of
the
word
often
have
not
where
to
lay
their
head
hunted
like
beasts
they
perish
on
the
scaffold
to
the
joy
of
assembled
peoples
while
angels
open
to
them
the
gates
of
heaven
therefore
your
destiny
is
a
secret
between
yourself
and
god
just
as
love
is
a
secret
between
two
hearts
you
may
be
the
buried
treasure
trodden
under
the
feet
of
men
thirsting
for
gold
yet
that
you
are
there
beneath
them
henceforth
your
existence
becomes
a
thing
of
ceaseless
activity
each
act
has
a
meaning
which
connects
you
with
god
just
as
in
love
your
actions
and
your
thoughts
are
filled
with
the
loved
one
but
love
and
its
joys
love
and
its
pleasures
limited
by
the
senses
are
but
the
imperfect
image
of
the
love
which
unites
you
to
your
celestial
spouse
all
earthly
joy
is
mixed
with
anguish
with
discontent
if
love
ought
not
to
pall
then
death
should
end
it
while
its
flame
is
high
so
that
we
see
no
ashes
but
in
god
our
wretchedness
becomes
delight
joy
lives
upon
itself
and
multiplies
and
grows
and
has
no
limit
in
the
earthly
life
our
fleeting
love
is
ended
by
tribulation
in
the
spiritual
life
the
tribulations
of
a
day
end
in
joys
unending
the
soul
is
ceaselessly
joyful
we
feel
god
with
us
in
us
he
gives
a
sacred
savor
to
all
things
he
shines
in
the
soul
he
imparts
to
us
his
sweetness
he
stills
our
interest
in
the
world
viewed
for
ourselves
he
quickens
our
interest
in
it
viewed
for
his
sake
and
grants
us
the
exercise
of
his
power
upon
it
in
his
name
we
do
the
works
which
he
inspires
we
act
for
him
we
have
no
self
except
in
him
we
love
his
creatures
with
undying
love
we
dry
their
tears
and
long
to
bring
them
unto
him
as
a
loving
woman
longs
to
see
the
inhabitants
of
earth
obey
her
the
final
life
the
fruition
of
all
other
lives
to
which
the
powers
of
the
soul
have
tended
and
whose
merits
open
the
sacred
portals
to
perfected
man
is
the
life
of
prayer
who
can
make
you
comprehend
the
grandeur
the
majesty
the
might
of
prayer
may
my
voice
these
words
of
mine
ring
in
your
hearts
and
change
them
be
now
here
what
you
may
be
after
cruel
trial
there
are
privileged
beings
prophets
seers
messengers
and
martyrs
all
those
who
suffer
for
the
word
and
who
proclaim
it
such
souls
spring
at
a
bound
across
the
human
sphere
and
rise
at
once
to
prayer
so
too
with
those
whose
souls
receive
the
fire
of
faith
be
one
of
those
brave
souls
god
welcomes
boldness
he
loves
to
be
taken
by
violence
he
will
never
reject
those
who
force
their
way
to
him
know
this
desire
the
torrent
of
your
will
is
so
that
a
single
emission
of
it
made
with
force
can
obtain
all
a
single
cry
uttered
under
the
pressure
of
faith
suffices
be
one
of
such
beings
full
of
force
of
will
of
love
be
conquerors
on
the
earth
let
the
hunger
and
thirst
of
god
possess
you
fly
to
him
as
the
hart
panting
for
the
desire
shall
lend
you
its
wings
tears
those
blossoms
of
repentance
shall
be
the
celestial
baptism
from
which
your
nature
will
issue
purified
cast
yourself
on
the
breast
of
the
stream
in
prayer
silence
and
meditation
are
the
means
of
following
the
way
god
reveals
himself
unfailingly
to
the
solitary
thoughtful
seeker
it
is
thus
that
the
separation
takes
place
between
matter
which
so
long
has
wrapped
its
darkness
round
you
and
spirit
which
was
in
you
from
the
beginning
the
light
which
lighted
you
and
now
brings
to
your
soul
yes
your
broken
heart
shall
receive
the
light
the
light
shall
bathe
it
then
you
will
no
longer
feel
convictions
they
will
have
changed
to
certainties
the
poet
utters
the
thinker
meditates
the
righteous
acts
but
he
who
stands
upon
the
borders
of
the
divine
world
prays
and
his
prayer
is
word
thought
action
in
one
yes
prayer
includes
all
contains
all
it
completes
nature
for
it
reveals
to
you
the
mind
within
it
and
its
progression
white
and
shining
virgin
of
all
human
virtues
ark
of
the
covenant
between
earth
and
heaven
tender
and
strong
companion
partaking
of
the
lion
and
of
the
lamb
prayer
prayer
will
give
you
the
key
of
heaven
bold
and
pure
as
innocence
strong
like
all
that
is
single
and
simple
this
glorious
invincible
queen
rests
nevertheless
on
the
material
world
she
takes
possession
of
it
like
the
sun
she
clasps
it
in
a
circle
of
light
the
universe
belongs
to
him
who
wills
who
knows
who
prays
but
he
must
will
he
must
know
he
must
pray
in
a
word
he
must
possess
force
wisdom
and
faith
therefore
prayer
issuing
from
so
many
trials
is
the
consummation
of
all
truths
all
powers
all
feelings
fruit
of
the
laborious
progressive
continued
development
of
natural
properties
and
faculties
vitalized
anew
by
the
divine
breath
of
the
word
prayer
has
occult
activity
it
is
the
final
worship
not
the
material
worship
of
images
nor
the
spiritual
worship
of
formulas
but
the
worship
of
the
divine
world
we
say
no
prayers
prayer
forms
within
us
it
is
a
faculty
which
acts
of
itself
it
has
attained
a
way
of
action
which
lifts
it
outside
of
forms
it
links
the
soul
to
god
with
whom
we
unite
as
the
root
of
the
tree
unites
with
the
soil
our
veins
draw
life
from
the
principle
of
life
and
we
live
by
the
life
of
the
universe
prayer
bestows
external
conviction
by
making
us
penetrate
the
material
world
through
the
cohesion
of
all
our
faculties
with
the
elementary
substances
it
bestows
internal
conviction
by
developing
our
essence
and
mingling
it
with
that
of
the
spiritual
worlds
to
be
able
to
pray
thus
you
must
attain
to
an
utter
abandonment
of
flesh
you
must
acquire
through
the
fires
of
the
furnace
the
purity
of
the
diamond
for
this
complete
communion
with
the
divine
is
obtained
only
in
absolute
repose
where
storms
and
conflicts
are
at
rest
yes
prayer
the
aspiration
of
the
soul
freed
absolutely
from
the
body
bears
all
forces
within
it
and
applies
them
to
the
constant
and
perseverant
union
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
when
you
possess
the
faculty
of
praying
without
weariness
with
love
with
force
with
certainty
with
intelligence
your
spiritualized
nature
will
presently
be
invested
with
power
like
a
rushing
wind
like
a
thunderbolt
it
cuts
its
way
through
all
things
and
shares
the
power
of
god
the
quickness
of
the
spirit
becomes
yours
in
an
instant
you
may
pass
from
region
to
region
like
the
word
itself
you
are
transported
from
the
ends
of
the
world
to
other
worlds
harmony
exists
and
you
are
part
of
it
light
is
there
and
your
eyes
possess
it
melody
is
heard
and
you
echo
it
under
such
conditions
you
feel
your
perceptions
developing
widening
the
eyes
of
your
mind
reach
to
vast
distances
there
is
in
truth
neither
time
nor
place
to
the
spirit
space
and
duration
are
proportions
created
for
matter
spirit
and
matter
have
naught
in
common
though
these
things
take
place
in
stillness
in
silence
without
agitation
without
external
movement
yet
prayer
is
all
action
but
it
is
spiritual
action
stripped
of
substantiality
and
reduced
like
the
motion
of
the
worlds
to
an
invisible
pure
force
it
penetrates
everywhere
like
light
it
gives
vitality
to
souls
that
come
beneath
its
rays
as
nature
beneath
the
sun
it
resuscitates
virtue
purifies
and
sanctifies
all
actions
peoples
solitude
and
gives
a
foretaste
of
eternal
joys
when
you
have
once
felt
the
delights
of
the
divine
intoxication
which
comes
of
this
internal
travail
then
all
is
yours
once
take
the
lute
on
which
we
sing
to
god
within
your
hands
and
you
will
never
part
with
it
hence
the
solitude
in
which
angelic
spirits
live
hence
their
disdain
of
human
joys
they
are
withdrawn
from
those
who
must
die
to
live
they
hear
the
language
of
such
beings
but
they
no
longer
understand
their
ideas
they
wonder
at
their
movements
at
what
the
world
terms
policies
material
laws
societies
for
them
all
mysteries
are
over
truth
and
truth
alone
is
theirs
they
who
have
reached
the
point
where
their
eyes
discern
the
sacred
portals
who
not
looking
back
not
uttering
one
regret
contemplate
worlds
and
comprehend
their
destinies
such
as
they
keep
silence
wait
and
bear
their
final
struggles
the
worst
of
all
those
struggles
is
the
last
at
the
zenith
of
all
virtue
is
resignation
to
be
an
exile
and
not
lament
no
longer
to
delight
in
earthly
things
and
yet
to
smile
to
belong
to
god
and
yet
to
stay
with
men
you
hear
the
voice
that
cries
to
you
advance
often
celestial
visions
of
descending
angels
compass
you
about
with
songs
of
praise
then
tearless
uncomplaining
must
you
watch
them
as
they
reascent
the
skies
to
murmur
is
to
forfeit
all
resignation
is
a
fruit
that
ripens
at
the
gates
of
heaven
how
powerful
how
glorious
the
calm
smile
the
pure
brow
of
the
resigned
human
creature
radiant
is
the
light
of
that
brow
they
who
live
in
its
atmosphere
grow
purer
that
calm
glance
penetrates
and
softens
more
eloquent
by
silence
than
the
prophet
by
speech
such
beings
triumph
by
their
simple
presence
their
ears
are
quick
to
hear
as
a
faithful
dog
listening
for
his
master
brighter
than
hope
stronger
than
love
higher
than
faith
that
creature
of
resignation
is
the
virgin
standing
on
the
earth
who
holds
for
a
moment
the
conquered
palm
then
rising
heavenward
leaves
behind
her
the
imprint
of
her
white
pure
feet
when
she
has
passed
away
men
flock
around
and
cry
see
see
sometimes
god
holds
her
still
in
sight
a
figure
to
whose
feet
creep
forms
and
species
of
animality
to
be
shown
their
way
she
wafts
the
light
exhaling
from
her
hair
and
they
see
she
speaks
and
they
hear
a
miracle
they
cry
often
she
triumphs
in
the
name
of
god
frightened
men
deny
her
and
put
her
to
death
smiling
she
lays
down
her
sword
and
goes
to
the
stake
having
saved
the
peoples
how
many
a
pardoned
angel
has
passed
from
martyrdom
to
heaven
sinai
golgotha
are
not
in
this
place
nor
in
that
angels
are
crucified
in
every
place
in
every
sphere
sighs
pierce
to
god
from
the
whole
universe
this
earth
on
which
we
live
is
but
a
single
sheaf
of
the
great
harvest
humanity
is
but
a
species
in
the
vast
garden
where
the
flowers
of
heaven
are
cultivated
everywhere
god
is
like
unto
himself
and
everywhere
by
prayer
it
is
easy
to
reach
with
these
words
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
another
hagar
in
the
wilderness
burning
the
souls
of
the
hearers
as
the
live
coal
of
the
word
inflamed
isaiah
this
mysterious
being
paused
as
though
to
gather
some
remaining
strength
wilfrid
and
minna
dared
not
speak
suddenly
he
lifted
himself
up
to
die
soul
of
all
things
oh
my
god
thou
whom
i
love
for
thyself
thou
judge
and
father
receive
a
love
which
has
no
limit
give
me
of
thine
essence
and
thy
faculties
that
i
be
wholly
thine
take
me
that
i
no
longer
be
myself
am
i
not
purified
then
cast
me
back
into
the
furnace
if
i
be
not
yet
proved
in
the
fire
make
me
some
nurturing
ploughshare
or
the
sword
of
victory
grant
me
a
glorious
martyrdom
in
which
to
proclaim
thy
word
rejected
i
will
bless
thy
justice
but
if
excess
of
love
may
win
in
a
moment
that
which
hard
and
patient
labor
can
not
attain
then
bear
me
upward
in

i

thee

thee

away
nay
if
thou
wilt
reject
me
thou
art
he
who
can

ah
he

after
a
pause
the
bonds

chapter
vii
the
assumption
the
last
psalm
was
uttered
neither
by
word
look
nor
gesture
nor
by
any
of
those
signs
which
men
employ
to
communicate
their
thoughts
but
as
the
soul
speaks
to
itself
for
at
the
moment
when
seraphita
revealed
herself
in
her
true
nature
her
thoughts
were
no
longer
enslaved
by
human
words
the
violence
of
that
last
prayer
had
burst
her
bonds
her
soul
like
a
white
dove
remained
for
an
instant
poised
above
the
body
whose
exhausted
substances
were
about
to
be
annihilated
the
aspiration
of
the
soul
toward
heaven
was
so
contagious
that
wilfrid
and
minna
beholding
those
radiant
scintillations
of
life
perceived
not
death
they
had
fallen
on
their
knees
when
had
turned
toward
his
orient
and
they
shared
his
ecstasy
the
fear
of
the
lord
which
creates
man
a
second
time
purging
away
his
dross
mastered
their
hearts
their
eyes
veiled
to
the
things
of
earth
were
opened
to
the
brightness
of
heaven
though
like
the
seers
of
old
called
prophets
by
men
they
were
filled
with
the
terror
of
the
most
high
yet
like
them
they
continued
firm
when
they
found
themselves
within
the
radiance
where
the
glory
of
the
shone
the
veil
of
flesh
which
until
now
had
hidden
that
glory
from
their
eyes
dissolved
imperceptibly
away
and
left
them
free
to
behold
the
divine
substance
they
stood
in
the
twilight
of
the
coming
dawn
whose
feeble
rays
prepared
them
to
look
upon
the
true
light
to
hear
the
living
word
and
yet
not
die
in
this
state
they
began
to
perceive
the
immeasurable
differences
which
separate
the
things
of
earth
from
the
things
of
heaven
on
the
borders
of
which
they
stood
leaning
upon
each
other
trembling
and
illuminated
like
two
children
standing
under
shelter
in
presence
of
a
conflagration
that
life
offered
no
lodgment
to
the
senses
the
ideas
they
used
to
interpret
their
vision
to
themselves
were
to
the
things
seen
what
the
visible
senses
of
a
man
are
to
his
soul
the
material
covering
of
a
divine
essence
the
departing
was
above
them
shedding
incense
without
odor
melody
without
sound
about
them
where
they
stood
were
neither
surfaces
nor
angles
nor
atmosphere
they
dared
neither
question
him
nor
contemplate
him
they
stood
in
the
shadow
of
that
presence
as
beneath
the
burning
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
fearing
to
raise
their
eyes
lest
the
light
should
blast
them
they
knew
they
were
beside
him
without
being
able
to
perceive
how
it
was
that
they
stood
as
in
a
dream
on
the
confines
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
nor
how
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
visible
and
how
they
beheld
the
invisible
to
each
other
they
said
if
he
touches
us
we
can
die
but
the
was
now
within
the
infinite
and
they
knew
not
that
neither
time
nor
space
nor
death
existed
there
and
that
a
great
gulf
lay
between
them
although
they
thought
themselves
beside
him
their
souls
were
not
prepared
to
receive
in
its
fulness
a
knowledge
of
the
faculties
of
that
life
they
could
have
only
faint
and
confused
perceptions
of
it
suited
to
their
weakness
were
it
not
so
the
thunder
of
the
whose
tones
now
reached
their
ears
and
whose
meaning
entered
their
souls
as
life
unites
with
body
one
echo
of
that
word
would
have
consumed
their
being
as
a
whirlwind
of
fire
laps
up
a
fragile
straw
therefore
they
saw
only
that
which
their
nature
sustained
by
the
strength
of
the
permitted
them
to
see
they
heard
that
only
which
they
were
able
to
hear
and
yet
though
thus
protected
they
shuddered
when
the
voice
of
the
anguished
soul
broke
forth
above
them
the
prayer
of
the
awaiting
life
and
imploring
it
with
a
cry
that
cry
froze
them
to
the
very
marrow
of
their
bones
the
knocked
at
the
what
wilt
thou
answered
a
whose
question
echoed
among
the
worlds
to
go
to
hast
thou
conquered
i
have
conquered
the
flesh
through
abstinence
i
have
conquered
false
knowledge
by
humility
i
have
conquered
pride
by
charity
i
have
conquered
the
earth
by
love
i
have
paid
my
dues
by
suffering
i
am
purified
in
the
fires
of
faith
i
have
longed
for
life
by
prayer
i
wait
in
adoration
and
i
am
no
answer
came
god
s
will
be
done
answered
the
believing
that
he
was
about
to
be
rejected
his
tears
flowed
and
fell
like
dew
upon
the
heads
of
the
two
kneeling
witnesses
who
trembled
before
the
justice
of
god
suddenly
the
trumpets
sounded
the
last
trumpets
of
victory
won
by
the
in
this
last
trial
the
reverberation
passed
through
space
as
sound
through
its
echo
filling
it
and
shaking
the
universe
which
wilfrid
and
minna
felt
like
an
atom
beneath
their
feet
they
trembled
under
an
anguish
caused
by
the
dread
of
the
mystery
about
to
be
accomplished
a
great
movement
took
place
as
though
the
eternal
legions
putting
themselves
in
motion
were
passing
upward
in
spiral
columns
the
worlds
revolved
like
clouds
driven
by
a
furious
wind
it
was
all
rapid
suddenly
the
veils
were
rent
away
they
saw
on
high
as
it
were
a
star
incomparably
more
lustrous
than
the
most
luminous
of
material
stars
which
detached
itself
and
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
dazzling
as
lightning
its
passage
paled
the
faces
of
the
pair
who
thought
it
to
be
itself
it
was
the
messenger
of
good
tidings
the
plume
of
whose
helmet
was
a
flame
of
life
behind
him
lay
the
swath
of
his
way
gleaming
with
a
flood
of
the
lights
through
which
he
passed
he
bore
a
palm
and
a
sword
he
touched
the
with
the
palm
and
the
was
transfigured
its
white
wings
noiselessly
unfolded
this
communication
of
changing
the
into
a
and
clothing
it
with
a
glorious
form
a
celestial
armor
poured
down
such
effulgent
rays
that
the
two
seers
were
paralyzed
like
the
three
apostles
to
whom
jesus
showed
himself
they
felt
the
dead
weight
of
their
bodies
which
denied
them
a
complete
and
cloudless
intuition
of
and
true
they
comprehended
the
nakedness
of
their
souls
they
were
able
to
measure
the
poverty
of
their
light
by
comparing
it
a
humbling
task
with
the
halo
of
the
a
passionate
desire
to
plunge
back
into
the
mire
of
earth
and
suffer
trial
took
possession
of
them
trial
through
which
they
might
victoriously
utter
at
the
the
words
of
that
radiant
the
knelt
before
the
beholding
it
at
last
face
to
face
and
he
said
raising
his
hands
thitherward
grant
that
these
two
may
have
further
sight
they
will
love
the
lord
and
proclaim
his
at
this
prayer
a
veil
fell
whether
it
were
that
the
hidden
force
which
held
the
seers
had
momentarily
annihilated
their
physical
bodies
or
that
it
raised
their
spirits
above
those
bodies
certain
it
is
that
they
felt
within
them
a
rending
of
the
pure
from
the
impure
the
tears
of
the
rose
about
them
like
a
vapor
which
hid
the
lower
worlds
from
their
knowledge
held
them
in
its
folds
bore
them
upwards
gave
them
forgetfulness
of
earthly
meanings
and
the
power
of
comprehending
the
meanings
of
things
divine
the
true
light
shone
it
illumined
the
creations
which
seemed
to
them
barren
when
they
saw
the
source
from
which
all
worlds
terrestrial
spiritual
and
their
motion
each
world
possessed
a
centre
to
which
converged
all
points
of
its
circumference
these
worlds
were
themselves
the
points
which
moved
toward
the
centre
of
their
system
each
system
had
its
centre
in
great
celestial
regions
which
communicated
with
the
flaming
and
quenchless
of
all
that
thus
from
the
greatest
to
the
smallest
of
the
worlds
and
from
the
smallest
of
the
worlds
to
the
smallest
portion
of
the
beings
who
compose
it
all
was
individual
and
all
was
nevertheless
one
and
indivisible
what
was
the
design
of
the
being
fixed
in
his
essence
and
in
his
faculties
who
transmitted
that
essence
and
those
faculties
without
losing
them
who
manifested
them
outside
of
himself
without
separating
them
from
himself
who
rendered
his
creations
outside
of
himself
fixed
in
their
essence
and
mutable
in
their
form
the
pair
thus
called
to
the
celestial
festival
could
only
see
the
order
and
arrangement
of
created
beings
and
admire
the
immediate
result
the
angels
alone
see
more
they
know
the
means
they
comprehend
the
final
end
but
what
the
two
elect
were
granted
power
to
contemplate
what
they
were
able
to
bring
back
as
a
testimony
which
enlightened
their
minds
forever
after
was
the
proof
of
the
action
of
the
worlds
and
of
beings
the
consciousness
of
the
effort
with
which
they
all
converge
to
the
result
they
heard
the
divers
parts
of
the
infinite
forming
one
living
melody
and
each
time
that
the
accord
made
itself
felt
like
a
mighty
respiration
the
worlds
drawn
by
the
concordant
movement
inclined
themselves
toward
the
supreme
being
who
from
his
impenetrable
centre
issued
all
things
and
recalled
all
things
to
himself
this
ceaseless
alternation
of
voices
and
silence
seemed
the
rhythm
of
the
sacred
hymn
which
resounds
and
prolongs
its
sound
from
age
to
age
wilfrid
and
minna
were
enabled
to
understand
some
of
the
mysterious
sayings
of
him
who
had
appeared
on
earth
in
the
form
which
to
each
of
them
had
rendered
him
comprehensible
to
one
seraphitus
to
the
other
seraphita
for
they
saw
that
all
was
homogeneous
in
the
sphere
where
he
now
was
light
gave
birth
to
melody
melody
gave
birth
to
light
colors
were
light
and
melody
motion
was
a
number
endowed
with
utterance
all
things
were
at
once
sonorous
diaphanous
and
mobile
so
that
each
interpenetrated
the
other
the
whole
vast
area
was
unobstructed
and
the
angels
could
survey
it
from
the
depths
of
the
infinite
they
perceived
the
puerility
of
human
sciences
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
them
the
scene
was
to
them
a
prospect
without
horizon
a
boundless
space
into
which
an
desire
prompted
them
to
plunge
but
fastened
to
their
miserable
bodies
they
had
the
desire
without
the
power
to
fulfil
it
the
preparing
for
his
flight
no
longer
looked
towards
them
he
had
nothing
now
in
common
with
earth
upward
he
rose
the
shadow
of
his
luminous
presence
covered
the
two
seers
like
a
merciful
veil
enabling
them
to
raise
their
eyes
and
see
him
rising
in
his
glory
to
heaven
in
company
with
the
glad
archangel
he
rose
as
the
sun
from
the
bosom
of
the
eastern
waves
but
more
majestic
than
the
orb
and
vowed
to
higher
destinies
he
could
not
be
enchained
like
inferior
creations
in
the
spiral
movement
of
the
worlds
he
followed
the
line
of
the
infinite
pointing
without
deviation
to
the
one
centre
there
to
enter
his
eternal
life
to
receive
there
in
his
faculties
and
in
his
essence
the
power
to
enjoy
through
love
and
the
gift
of
comprehending
through
wisdom
the
scene
which
suddenly
unveiled
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
two
seers
crushed
them
with
a
sense
of
its
vastness
they
felt
like
atoms
whose
minuteness
was
not
to
be
compared
even
to
the
smallest
particle
which
the
infinite
of
divisibility
enabled
the
mind
of
man
to
imagine
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
infinite
of
numbers
which
god
alone
can
comprehend
as
he
alone
can
comprehend
himself
strength
and
love
what
heights
what
depths
in
those
two
entities
whom
the
first
prayer
placed
like
two
links
as
it
were
to
unite
the
immensities
of
the
lower
worlds
with
the
immensity
of
the
higher
universe
they
comprehended
the
invisible
ties
by
which
the
material
worlds
are
bound
to
the
spiritual
worlds
remembering
the
sublime
efforts
of
human
genius
they
were
able
to
perceive
the
principle
of
all
melody
in
the
songs
of
heaven
which
gave
sensations
of
color
of
perfume
of
thought
which
recalled
the
innumerable
details
of
all
creations
as
the
songs
of
earth
revive
the
infinite
memories
of
love
brought
by
the
exaltation
of
their
faculties
to
a
point
that
can
not
be
described
in
any
language
they
were
able
to
cast
their
eyes
for
an
instant
into
the
divine
world
there
all
was
rejoicing
myriads
of
angels
were
flocking
together
without
confusion
all
alike
yet
all
dissimilar
simple
as
the
flower
of
the
fields
majestic
as
the
universe
wilfrid
and
minna
saw
neither
their
coming
nor
their
going
they
appeared
suddenly
in
the
infinite
and
filled
it
with
their
presence
as
the
stars
shine
in
the
invisible
ether
the
scintillations
of
their
united
diadems
illumined
space
like
the
fires
of
the
sky
at
dawn
upon
the
mountains
waves
of
light
flowed
from
their
hair
and
their
movements
created
tremulous
undulations
in
space
like
the
billows
of
a
phosphorescent
sea
the
two
seers
beheld
the
dimly
in
the
midst
of
the
immortal
legions
suddenly
as
though
all
the
arrows
of
a
quiver
had
darted
together
the
spirits
swept
away
with
a
breath
the
last
vestiges
of
the
human
form
as
the
rose
he
became
yet
purer
soon
he
seemed
to
them
but
a
faint
outline
of
what
he
had
been
at
the
moment
of
his
transfiguration
lines
of
fire
without
shadow
higher
he
rose
receiving
from
circle
to
circle
some
new
gift
while
the
sign
of
his
election
was
transmitted
to
each
sphere
into
which
more
and
more
purified
he
entered
no
voice
was
silent
the
hymn
diffused
and
multiplied
itself
in
all
its
modulations
hail
to
him
who
enters
living
come
flower
of
the
worlds
diamond
from
the
fires
of
suffering
pearl
without
spot
desire
without
flesh
new
link
of
earth
and
heaven
be
light
conquering
spirit
queen
of
the
world
come
for
thy
crown
victor
of
earth
receive
thy
diadem
thou
art
of
us
the
virtues
of
the
shone
forth
in
all
their
beauty
his
earliest
desire
for
heaven
tender
as
childhood
the
deeds
of
his
life
like
constellations
adorned
him
with
their
brightness
his
acts
of
faith
shone
like
the
jacinth
of
heaven
the
color
of
sidereal
fires
the
pearls
of
charity
were
upon
him
a
chaplet
of
garnered
tears
love
divine
surrounded
him
with
roses
and
the
whiteness
of
his
resignation
obliterated
all
earthly
trace
soon
to
the
eyes
of
the
seers
he
was
but
a
point
of
flame
growing
brighter
and
brighter
as
its
motion
was
lost
in
the
melodious
acclamations
which
welcomed
his
entrance
into
heaven
the
celestial
accents
made
the
two
exiles
weep
suddenly
a
silence
as
of
death
spread
like
a
mourning
veil
from
the
first
to
the
highest
sphere
throwing
wilfrid
and
minna
into
a
state
of
intolerable
expectation
at
this
moment
the
was
lost
to
sight
within
the
receiving
there
the
gift
of
life
eternal
a
movement
of
adoration
made
by
the
host
of
heaven
filled
the
two
seers
with
ecstasy
mingled
with
terror
they
felt
that
all
were
prostrate
before
the
throne
in
all
the
spheres
in
the
spheres
divine
in
the
spiritual
spheres
and
in
the
worlds
of
darkness
the
angels
bent
the
knee
to
celebrate
the
glory
the
spirits
bent
the
knee
in
token
of
their
impatience
others
bent
the
knee
in
the
dark
abysses
shuddering
with
awe
a
mighty
cry
of
joy
gushed
forth
as
the
spring
gushes
forth
to
its
millions
of
flowering
herbs
sparkling
with
diamond
in
the
sunlight
at
that
instant
the
reappeared
effulgent
crying
eternal
the
universe
heard
the
cry
and
understood
it
it
penetrated
the
spheres
as
god
penetrates
them
it
took
possession
of
the
infinite
the
seven
divine
worlds
heard
the
voice
and
answered
a
mighty
movement
was
perceptible
as
though
whole
planets
purified
were
rising
in
dazzling
light
to
become
eternal
had
the
obtained
as
a
first
mission
the
work
of
calling
to
god
the
creations
permeated
by
his
word
but
already
the
sublime
was
sounding
in
the
ear
of
the
desolate
ones
as
the
distant
undulations
of
an
ended
melody
already
the
celestial
lights
were
fading
like
the
gold
and
crimson
tints
of
a
setting
sun
death
and
impurity
recovered
their
prey
as
the
two
mortals
the
prison
of
flesh
from
which
their
spirit
had
momentarily
been
delivered
by
some
priceless
sleep
they
felt
like
those
who
wake
after
a
night
of
brilliant
dreams
the
memory
of
which
still
lingers
in
their
soul
though
their
body
retains
no
consciousness
of
them
and
human
language
is
unable
to
give
utterance
to
them
the
deep
darkness
of
the
sphere
that
was
now
about
them
was
that
of
the
sun
of
the
visible
worlds
let
us
descend
to
those
lower
regions
said
wilfrid
let
us
do
what
he
told
us
to
do
answered
minna
we
have
seen
the
worlds
on
their
march
to
god
we
know
the
path
our
diadem
of
stars
is
floating
downward
through
the
abysses
they
the
dust
of
the
lesser
worlds
and
saw
the
earth
like
a
subterranean
cavern
suddenly
illuminated
to
their
eyes
by
the
light
which
their
souls
brought
with
them
and
which
still
environed
them
in
a
cloud
of
the
paling
harmonies
of
heaven
the
sight
was
that
which
of
old
struck
the
inner
eyes
of
seers
and
prophets
ministers
of
all
religions
preachers
of
all
pretended
truths
kings
consecrated
by
force
and
terror
warriors
and
mighty
men
apportioning
the
peoples
among
them
the
learned
and
the
rich
standing
above
the
suffering
noisy
crowd
and
noisily
grinding
them
beneath
their
feet
all
were
there
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
servants
all
were
robed
in
stuffs
of
gold
and
silver
and
azure
studded
with
pearls
and
gems
torn
from
the
bowels
of
earth
stolen
from
the
depths
of
ocean
for
which
humanity
had
toiled
throughout
the
centuries
sweating
and
blaspheming
but
these
treasures
these
splendors
constructed
of
blood
seemed
rags
to
the
eyes
of
the
two
exiles
what
do
you
there
in
motionless
ranks
cried
wilfrid
they
answered
not
what
do
you
there
motionless
they
answered
not
wilfrid
waved
his
hands
over
them
crying
in
a
loud
voice
what
do
you
there
in
motionless
ranks
all
with
unanimous
action
opened
their
garments
and
gave
to
sight
their
withered
bodies
eaten
with
worms
putrefied
crumbling
to
dust
rotten
with
horrible
diseases
you
lead
the
nations
to
death
wilfrid
said
to
them
you
have
depraved
the
earth
perverted
the
word
prostituted
justice
after
devouring
the
grass
of
the
fields
you
have
killed
the
lambs
of
the
fold
do
you
think
yourself
justified
because
of
your
sores
i
will
warn
my
brethren
who
have
ears
to
hear
the
voice
and
they
will
come
and
drink
of
the
spring
of
living
waters
which
you
have
let
us
save
our
strength
for
prayer
said
minna
wilfrid
thy
mission
is
not
that
of
the
prophets
or
the
avenger
or
the
messenger
we
are
still
on
the
confines
of
the
lowest
sphere
let
us
endeavor
to
rise
through
space
on
the
wings
of
thou
shalt
be
all
my
love
thou
shalt
be
all
my
strength
we
have
seen
the
mysteries
we
are
each
to
the
other
the
only
being
here
below
to
whom
joy
and
sadness
are
comprehensible
let
us
pray
therefore
we
know
the
path
let
us
walk
in
give
me
thy
hand
said
the
young
girl
if
we
walk
together
the
way
will
be
to
me
less
hard
and
with
thee
with
thee
alone
replied
the
man
can
i
cross
the
awful
solitude
without
together
we
will
go
to
heaven
she
said
the
clouds
gathered
and
formed
a
darksome
dais
suddenly
the
pair
found
themselves
kneeling
beside
a
body
which
old
david
was
guarding
from
curious
eyes
resolved
to
bury
it
himself
beyond
those
walls
the
first
summer
of
the
nineteenth
century
shone
forth
in
all
its
glory
the
two
lovers
believed
they
heard
a
voice
in
the
they
breathed
a
celestial
essence
from
the
flowers
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
they
said
that
illimitable
ocean
which
shines
below
us
is
but
an
image
of
what
we
saw
where
are
you
going
asked
monsieur
becker
to
god
they
answered
come
with
us
father
