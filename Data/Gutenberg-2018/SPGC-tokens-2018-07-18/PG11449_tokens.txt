into
the
obligations
of
christians
to
use
means
for
the

of

heathens
in

the
religious
state
of

of

of
former

and

practicability
of
further
undertakings
are
considered
by

there
is
no
difference
between
the

and

for
the

how

shall

on

not
believed
and
how

believe
in

mdccxcii
introduction
as
our
blessed
lord
has
required
us
to
pray
that
his
kingdom
may
come
and
his
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
it
becomes
us
not
only
to
express
our
desires
of
that
event
by
words
but
to
use
every
lawful
method
to
spread
the
knowledge
of
his
name
in
order
to
this
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
become
in
some
measure
acquainted
with
the
religious
state
of
the
world
and
as
this
is
an
object
we
should
be
prompted
to
pursue
not
only
by
the
gospel
of
our
redeemer
but
even
by
the
feelings
of
humanity
so
an
inclination
to
conscientious
activity
therein
would
form
one
of
the
strongest
proofs
that
we
are
the
subjects
of
grace
and
partakers
of
that
spirit
of
universal
benevolence
and
genuine
philanthropy
which
appear
so
eminent
in
the
of
god
himself
sin
was
introduced
amongst
the
children
of
men
by
the
fall
of
adam
and
has
ever
since
been
spreading
its
baneful
influence
by
changing
its
appearances
to
suit
the
circumstances
of
the
times
it
has
grown
up
in
ten
thousand
forms
and
constantly
counteracted
the
will
and
designs
of
god
one
would
have
supposed
that
the
remembrance
of
the
deluge
would
have
been
transmitted
from
father
to
son
and
have
perpetually
deterred
mankind
from
transgressing
the
will
of
their
maker
but
so
blinded
were
they
that
in
the
time
of
abraham
gross
wickedness
prevailed
wherever
colonies
were
planted
and
the
iniquity
of
the
amorites
was
great
though
not
yet
full
after
this
idolatry
spread
more
and
more
till
the
seven
devoted
nations
were
cut
off
with
the
most
signal
marks
of
divine
displeasure
still
however
the
progress
of
evil
was
not
stopped
but
the
israelites
themselves
too
often
joined
with
the
rest
of
mankind
against
the
god
of
israel
in
one
period
the
grossest
ignorance
and
barbarism
prevailed
in
the
world
and
afterwards
in
a
more
enlightened
age
the
most
daring
infidelity
and
contempt
of
god
so
that
the
world
which
was
once
with
ignorance
now
wisdom
knew
not
god
but
changed
the
glory
of
the
incorruptible
as
much
as
in
the
most
barbarous
ages
an
image
made
like
to
corruptible
man
and
to
birds
and
beasts
and
creeping
nay
as
they
increased
in
science
and
politeness
they
ran
into
more
abundant
and
extravagant
idolatries
yet
god
repeatedly
made
known
his
intention
to
prevail
finally
over
all
the
power
of
the
devil
and
to
destroy
all
his
works
and
set
up
his
own
kingdom
and
interest
among
men
and
extend
it
as
universally
as
satan
had
extended
his
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
the
messiah
came
and
died
that
god
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
all
that
should
believe
in
him
when
he
had
laid
down
his
life
and
taken
it
up
again
he
sent
forth
his
disciples
to
preach
the
good
tidings
to
every
creature
and
to
endeavour
by
all
possible
methods
to
bring
over
a
lost
world
to
god
they
went
forth
according
to
their
divine
commission
and
wonderful
success
attended
their
labours
the
civilized
greeks
and
uncivilized
barbarians
each
yielded
to
the
cross
of
christ
and
embraced
it
as
the
only
way
of
salvation
since
the
apostolic
age
many
other
attempts
to
spread
the
gospel
have
been
made
which
have
been
considerably
successful
notwithstanding
which
a
very
considerable
part
of
mankind
are
still
involved
in
all
the
darkness
of
heathenism
some
attempts
are
still
making
but
they
are
inconsiderable
in
comparison
of
what
might
be
done
if
the
whole
body
of
christians
entered
heartily
into
the
spirit
of
the
divine
command
on
this
subject
some
think
little
about
it
others
are
unacquainted
with
the
state
of
the
world
and
others
love
their
wealth
better
than
the
souls
of
their
in
order
that
the
subject
may
be
taken
into
more
serious
consideration
i
shall
enquire
whether
the
commission
given
by
our
lord
to
his
disciples
be
not
still
binding
on
us
take
a
short
view
of
former
undertakings
give
some
account
of
the
present
state
of
the
world
consider
the
practicability
of
doing
something
more
than
is
done
and
the
duty
of
christians
in
general
in
this
matter
an
enquiry
sect
i
enquiry
whether
the
commission
given
by
our
lord
to
his
disciples
be
not
still
binding
on
our
lord
jesus
christ
a
little
before
his
departure
commissioned
his
apostles
to
and
all
or
as
another
evangelist
expresses
it
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
this
commission
was
as
extensive
as
possible
and
laid
them
under
obligation
to
disperse
themselves
into
every
country
of
the
habitable
globe
and
preach
to
all
the
inhabitants
without
exception
or
limitation
they
accordingly
went
forth
in
obedience
to
the
command
and
the
power
of
god
evidently
wrought
with
them
many
attempts
of
the
same
kind
have
been
made
since
their
day
and
which
have
been
attended
with
various
success
but
the
work
has
not
been
taken
up
or
prosecuted
of
late
years
except
by
a
few
individuals
with
that
zeal
and
perseverance
with
which
the
primitive
christians
went
about
it
it
seems
as
if
many
thought
the
commission
was
sufficiently
put
in
execution
by
what
the
apostles
and
others
have
done
that
we
have
enough
to
do
to
attend
to
the
salvation
of
our
own
countrymen
and
that
if
god
intends
the
salvation
of
the
heathen
he
will
some
way
or
other
bring
them
to
the
gospel
or
the
gospel
to
them
it
is
thus
that
multitudes
sit
at
ease
and
give
themselves
no
concern
about
the
far
greater
part
of
their
who
to
this
day
are
lost
in
ignorance
and
idolatry
there
seems
also
to
be
an
opinion
existing
in
the
minds
of
some
that
because
the
apostles
were
extraordinary
officers
and
have
no
proper
successors
and
because
many
things
which
were
right
for
them
to
do
would
be
utterly
unwarrantable
for
us
therefore
it
may
not
be
immediately
binding
on
us
to
execute
the
commission
though
it
was
so
upon
them
to
the
consideration
of
such
persons
i
would
offer
the
following
observations
first
if
the
command
of
christ
to
teach
all
nations
be
restricted
to
the
apostles
or
those
under
the
immediate
inspiration
of
the
holy
ghost
then
that
of
baptizing
should
be
so
too
and
every
denomination
of
christians
except
the
quakers
do
wrong
in
baptizing
with
water
at
all
secondly
if
the
command
of
christ
to
teach
all
nations
be
confined
to
the
apostles
then
all
such
ordinary
ministers
who
have
endeavoured
to
carry
the
gospel
to
the
heathens
have
acted
without
a
warrant
and
run
before
they
were
sent
yea
and
though
god
has
promised
the
most
glorious
things
to
the
heathen
world
by
sending
his
gospel
to
them
yet
whoever
goes
first
or
indeed
at
all
with
that
message
unless
he
have
a
new
and
special
commission
from
heaven
must
go
without
any
authority
for
so
doing
thirdly
if
the
command
of
christ
to
teach
all
nations
extend
only
to
the
apostles
then
doubtless
the
promise
of
the
divine
presence
in
this
work
must
be
so
limited
but
this
is
worded
in
such
a
manner
as
expressly
precludes
such
an
idea
i
am
with
you
always
to
the
end
of
the
that
there
are
cases
in
which
even
a
divine
command
may
cease
to
be
binding
is
admitted
as
for
instance
if
it
be
as
the
ceremonial
commandments
of
the
jewish
law
or
if
there
be
in
the
world
for
the
commanded
act
to
be
exercised
upon
as
in
the
law
of
septennial
release
which
might
be
dispensed
with
when
there
should
be
no
poor
in
the
land
to
have
their
debts
forgiven
deut
xv
or
if
in
any
particular
instance
we
can
produce
a
of
equal
authority
with
the
original
command
as
when
paul
and
silas
were
forbidden
of
the
holy
ghost
to
preach
the
word
in
bythinia
acts
xvi
or
if
in
any
case
there
be
a
of
putting
it
in
execution
it
was
not
the
duty
of
paul
to
preach
christ
to
the
inhabitants
of
otaheite
because
no
such
place
was
then
discovered
nor
had
he
any
means
of
coming
at
them
but
none
of
these
things
can
be
alledged
by
us
in
behalf
of
the
neglect
of
the
commission
given
by
christ
we
can
not
say
that
it
is
repealed
like
the
commands
of
the
ceremonial
law
nor
can
we
plead
that
there
are
no
objects
for
the
command
to
be
exercised
upon
alas
the
far
greater
part
of
the
world
as
we
shall
see
presently
are
still
covered
with
heathen
darkness
nor
can
we
produce
a
concerning
any
particular
nation
like
that
to
paul
and
silas
concerning
bythinia
and
if
we
could
it
would
not
warrant
our
sitting
still
and
neglecting
all
the
other
parts
of
the
world
for
paul
and
silas
when
forbidden
to
preach
to
those
heathens
went
elsewhere
and
preached
to
others
neither
can
we
alledge
a
natural
impossibility
in
the
case
it
has
been
said
that
we
ought
not
to
force
our
way
but
to
wait
for
the
openings
and
leadings
of
providence
but
it
might
with
equal
propriety
be
answered
in
this
case
neither
ought
we
to
neglect
embracing
those
openings
in
providence
which
daily
present
themselves
to
us
what
openings
of
providence
do
we
wait
for
we
can
neither
expect
to
be
transported
into
the
heathen
world
without
ordinary
means
nor
to
be
endowed
with
the
gift
of
tongues
when
we
arrive
there
these
would
not
be
providential
interpositions
but
miraculous
ones
where
a
command
exists
nothing
can
be
necessary
to
render
it
binding
but
a
removal
of
those
obstacles
which
render
obedience
impossible
and
these
are
removed
already
natural
impossibility
can
never
be
pleaded
so
long
as
facts
exist
to
prove
the
contrary
have
not
the
popish
missionaries
surmounted
all
those
difficulties
which
we
have
generally
thought
to
be
insuperable
have
not
the
missionaries
of
the
or
moravian
brethren
encountered
the
scorching
heat
of
abyssinia
and
the
frozen
climes
of
greenland
and
labrador
their
difficult
languages
and
savage
manners
or
have
not
english
traders
for
the
sake
of
gain
surmounted
all
those
things
which
have
generally
been
counted
insurmountable
obstacles
in
the
way
of
preaching
the
gospel
witness
the
trade
to
persia
the
china
and
greenland
yea
even
the
accursed
on
the
coasts
of
africa
men
can
insinuate
themselves
into
the
favour
of
the
most
barbarous
clans
and
uncultivated
tribes
for
the
sake
of
gain
and
how
different
soever
the
circumstances
of
trading
and
preaching
are
yet
this
will
prove
the
possibility
of
ministers
being
introduced
there
and
if
this
is
but
thought
a
sufficient
reason
to
make
the
experiment
my
point
is
gained
it
has
been
said
that
some
learned
divines
have
proved
from
scripture
that
the
time
is
not
yet
come
that
the
heathen
should
be
converted
and
that
first
the
must
be
and
many
other
prophecies
fulfilled
but
admitting
this
to
be
the
case
which
i
much
doubt
yet
if
any
objection
is
made
from
this
against
preaching
to
them
immediately
it
must
be
founded
on
one
of
these
things
either
that
the
secret
purpose
of
god
is
the
rule
of
our
duty
and
then
it
must
be
as
bad
to
pray
for
them
as
to
preach
to
them
or
else
that
none
shall
be
converted
in
the
heathen
world
till
the
universal
of
the
spirit
in
the
last
days
but
this
objection
comes
too
late
for
the
success
of
the
gospel
has
been
very
considerable
in
many
places
already
footnote
see
edwards
on
prayer
on
this
subject
lately
by
mr
sutcliffe
it
has
been
objected
that
there
are
multitudes
in
our
own
nation
and
within
our
immediate
spheres
of
action
who
are
as
ignorant
as
the
savages
and
that
therefore
we
have
work
enough
at
home
without
going
into
other
countries
that
there
are
thousands
in
our
own
land
as
far
from
god
as
possible
i
readily
grant
and
that
this
ought
to
excite
us
to
diligence
in
our
work
and
in
attempts
to
spread
divine
knowledge
amongst
them
is
a
certain
fact
but
that
it
ought
to
supercede
all
attempts
to
spread
the
gospel
in
foreign
parts
seems
to
want
proof
our
own
countrymen
have
the
means
of
grace
and
may
attend
on
the
word
preached
if
they
chuse
it
they
have
the
means
of
knowing
the
truth
and
faithful
ministers
are
placed
in
almost
every
part
of
the
land
whose
spheres
of
action
might
be
much
extended
if
their
congregations
were
but
more
hearty
and
active
in
the
cause
but
with
them
the
case
is
widely
different
who
have
no
bible
no
written
language
which
many
of
them
have
not
no
ministers
no
good
civil
government
nor
any
of
those
advantages
which
we
have
pity
therefore
humanity
and
much
more
christianity
call
loudly
for
every
possible
exertion
to
introduce
the
gospel
amongst
them
sect
ii
a
short
review
of
former
undertakings
for
the
conversion
of
the
before
the
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
whole
world
were
either
heathens
or
jews
and
both
as
to
the
body
of
them
were
enemies
to
the
gospel
after
the
resurrection
the
disciples
continued
in
jerusalem
till
pentecost
being
daily
engaged
in
prayer
and
supplication
and
having
chosen
matthias
to
supply
the
place
of
judas
in
the
apostolic
office
on
that
solemn
day
when
they
were
all
assembled
together
a
most
remarkable
effusion
of
the
holy
spirit
took
place
and
a
capacity
of
speaking
in
all
foreign
languages
was
bestowed
upon
them
this
opportunity
was
embraced
by
peter
for
preaching
the
gospel
to
a
great
congregation
of
jews
and
proselytes
who
were
from
parthia
media
elam
mesopotamia
judea
cappadocia
the
proconsular
asia
phrygia
pamphylia
egypt
lybia
crete
arabia
rome
and
at
the
first
effort
god
wrought
so
powerfully
that
three
thousand
were
converted
who
immediately
after
were
baptized
and
added
to
the
church
before
this
great
addition
they
consisted
of
but
about
hundred
and
twenty
but
from
that
time
they
continually
increased
it
was
but
a
little
after
this
that
peter
and
john
going
up
to
the
temple
healed
the
lame
man
this
miracle
drew
a
great
multitude
together
and
peter
took
occasion
while
they
stood
wondering
at
the
event
to
preach
jesus
christ
to
them
the
consequence
was
that
five
thousand
more
believed
this
was
not
done
without
opposition
the
priests
and
sadducees
tried
all
the
methods
they
could
invent
to
prevent
them
from
preaching
the
gospel
the
apostles
however
asserted
their
divine
warrant
and
as
soon
as
they
were
set
at
liberty
addressed
god
and
prayed
that
a
divine
power
might
attend
their
labours
which
petition
was
heard
and
their
future
ministry
was
very
successful
on
account
of
their
necessities
who
were
engaged
in
this
good
work
those
amongst
them
who
had
possessions
or
goods
sold
them
and
devoted
the
money
to
pious
uses
about
this
time
a
man
and
his
wife
out
of
great
pretensions
to
piety
sold
an
estate
and
brought
part
of
the
money
to
the
apostles
pretending
it
to
be
the
whole
for
which
dissimulation
both
he
and
his
wife
were
struck
dead
by
the
hand
of
god
this
awful
catastrophe
however
was
the
occasion
of
many
more
men
and
women
being
added
to
the
church
the
miracles
wrought
by
the
apostles
and
the
success
attending
their
ministry
stirred
up
greater
envy
in
the
priests
and
sadducees
who
imprisoned
them
from
which
confinement
they
were
soon
liberated
by
an
angel
upon
which
they
went
immediately
as
they
were
commanded
and
preached
in
the
temple
here
they
were
seized
and
brought
before
the
council
where
gamaliel
spake
in
their
favour
and
they
were
dismissed
after
this
they
continued
to
prosecute
their
work
rejoicing
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
the
name
of
christ
by
this
time
the
church
at
jerusalem
was
so
increased
that
the
multiplicity
of
its
temporal
concerns
was
the
occasion
of
some
neglects
which
produced
a
dissatisfaction
the
apostles
therefore
recommended
to
the
church
to
chuse
seven
pious
men
whose
office
it
should
be
to
attend
upon
its
temporal
affairs
that
might
give
themselves
to
prayer
and
the
ministry
of
the
seven
were
accordingly
chosen
over
whom
the
apostles
prayed
and
ordained
them
to
the
office
of
deacons
by
imposition
of
hands
and
these
things
being
settled
the
church
increased
more
and
more
one
of
these
deacons
whose
name
was
stephen
being
a
person
of
eminent
knowledge
and
holiness
wrought
many
miracles
and
disputed
with
great
evidence
and
energy
for
the
truth
of
christianity
which
raised
him
up
a
number
of
opponents
these
soon
procured
his
death
and
carried
their
resentment
so
far
as
to
stir
up
such
a
persecution
that
the
church
which
till
now
had
been
confined
to
jerusalem
was
dispersed
and
all
the
preachers
except
the
apostles
were
driven
thence
and
went
every
where
preaching
the
word
a
young
man
whose
name
was
was
very
active
in
this
persecution
he
had
been
educated
under
gamaliel
a
member
of
the
sanhedrim
was
a
person
of
promising
genius
by
profession
a
pharisee
and
much
attached
to
the
jewish
ceremonies
when
stephen
was
stoned
he
appeared
much
pleased
with
it
and
had
the
custody
of
the
clothes
of
his
executioners
and
from
that
time
was
fired
with
such
a
spirit
of
persecution
himself
that
he
went
about
dragging
some
to
prison
and
compelling
others
to
blaspheme
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
neither
was
he
contented
with
exercising
his
rage
at
jerusalem
but
went
to
the
chief
priests
and
obtained
testimonials
of
authority
to
carry
on
the
same
work
at
damascus
but
on
his
way
as
he
was
almost
ready
to
enter
into
the
city
the
lord
changed
his
heart
in
a
very
wonderful
manner
so
that
instead
of
entering
the
town
to
persecute
he
began
to
preach
the
gospel
as
soon
as
he
was
able
this
presently
brought
upon
him
the
same
persecution
which
he
had
designed
to
exercise
upon
others
and
even
endangered
his
life
so
that
the
brethren
found
it
necessary
to
let
him
down
the
city
wall
in
a
basket
by
night
and
so
he
escaped
the
hands
of
his
enemies
from
thence
he
went
to
jerusalem
where
he
preached
the
word
but
being
persecuted
there
he
went
to
cesarea
and
from
thence
to
tarsus
in
the
time
of
this
trouble
in
the
church
philip
went
and
preached
at
samaria
with
great
success
nay
so
great
was
the
work
that
an
impostor
who
had
deceived
the
people
with
legerdemain
tricks
for
a
long
time
was
so
amazed
and
even
convinced
as
to
profess
himself
a
christian
and
was
baptized
but
was
afterwards
detected
and
appeared
to
be
an
hypocrite
besides
him
a
great
number
believed
in
reality
and
being
baptized
a
church
was
formed
there
soon
after
this
the
lord
commanded
philip
to
go
the
way
which
led
from
jerusalem
to
gaza
which
he
did
and
there
found
an
eunuch
of
great
authority
in
the
court
of
ethiopia
to
whom
he
preached
christ
who
believed
and
was
baptized
after
which
philip
preached
at
ashdod
or
azotus
about
the
same
time
peter
went
to
lydda
or
diospolis
and
cured
eneas
of
a
palsy
which
was
a
mean
of
the
conversion
not
only
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
but
also
of
the
neighbouring
country
called
saron
the
capital
of
which
was
lasharon
and
while
he
was
there
a
circumstance
turned
up
which
tended
much
to
the
spread
of
the
truth
a
woman
of
joppa
a
town
in
the
neighbourhood
dying
they
sent
to
lydda
for
peter
who
went
over
and
when
he
had
prayed
she
was
raised
to
life
again
which
was
an
occasion
of
the
conversion
of
many
in
that
town
peter
continued
there
preaching
for
some
time
and
lodged
at
the
house
of
a
tanner
now
another
circumstance
also
tended
to
the
further
propogation
of
christianity
for
a
roman
military
officer
who
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
old
testament
scriptures
but
was
not
circumcised
was
one
day
engaged
in
prayer
in
his
house
at
cesarea
when
an
angel
appeared
to
him
and
bid
him
send
for
peter
from
joppa
to
preach
in
his
house
before
this
the
work
of
god
had
been
wholly
confined
to
the
jews
and
jewish
proselytes
and
even
the
apostles
appeared
to
have
had
very
contracted
ideas
of
the
christian
dispensation
but
now
god
by
a
vision
discovered
to
peter
that
christianity
was
to
be
spread
into
all
nations
he
accordingly
went
and
preached
at
the
house
of
cornelius
at
cesarea
when
several
were
converted
and
baptized
and
the
foundation
of
a
church
laid
in
that
city
some
of
the
dispersed
ministers
having
fled
to
antioch
in
syria
began
to
preach
to
the
greeks
in
that
city
about
the
same
time
and
had
good
success
upon
which
the
apostles
sent
paul
and
barnabas
who
instructed
and
strengthened
them
and
a
church
was
formed
in
that
city
also
which
in
a
little
time
sent
out
several
eminent
preachers
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
we
have
an
account
of
of
the
principal
journies
which
paul
and
his
companions
undertook
the
first
in
which
he
was
accompanied
by
barnabas
is
recorded
in
the
xiii
and
xiv
chapters
and
was
the
first
on
the
heathen
world
it
was
a
journey
into
the
lesser
asia
in
their
way
they
passed
over
the
island
of
cyprus
no
sooner
had
they
entered
on
their
undertaking
than
they
met
with
great
difficulty
for
mark
whom
they
had
taken
as
their
minister
deserted
them
and
returned
to
jerusalem
where
it
seems
he
thought
he
should
enjoy
the
greatest
quiet
paul
and
barnabas
however
went
forward
in
every
city
they
preached
the
word
of
the
lord
entering
into
the
jewish
synagogues
and
first
preaching
christ
to
them
and
then
to
the
gentiles
they
were
heard
with
great
candour
and
eagerness
by
some
and
rejected
by
others
with
obstinacy
and
wrath
and
cruel
persecution
one
while
they
had
enough
to
do
to
restrain
the
people
from
worshipping
them
as
gods
and
soon
after
paul
was
stoned
dragged
out
of
the
city
and
left
for
dead
having
penetrated
as
far
as
derbe
they
thought
proper
to
return
by
the
way
that
they
came
calling
at
every
city
where
they
had
sown
the
good
seed
and
finding
in
most
if
not
all
these
places
some
who
had
embraced
the
gospel
they
exhorted
and
strengthened
them
in
the
faith
formed
them
into
a
church
state
and
ordained
them
elders
fasted
and
prayed
with
them
and
so
having
commended
them
to
the
lord
on
whom
they
had
believed
returned
to
antioch
in
syria
from
whence
they
first
set
out
and
rehearsed
to
the
church
all
that
god
had
done
with
them
and
how
he
had
opened
the
door
of
faith
to
the
gentiles
about
this
time
a
dispute
arising
in
the
churches
concerning
circumcision
paul
and
barnabas
were
deputed
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
to
consult
the
apostles
and
elders
on
the
subject
this
business
being
adjusted
they
accompanied
with
judas
and
silas
returned
to
antioch
with
the
general
resolution
and
continued
there
for
a
season
teaching
and
preaching
the
word
of
the
lord
paul
now
proposed
to
barnabas
his
that
they
might
visit
their
brethren
in
the
places
where
they
had
been
already
and
see
how
they
did
to
this
barnabas
readily
acceded
but
a
difference
arising
between
them
about
taking
with
them
who
had
deserted
them
before
these
two
eminent
servants
of
god
were
parted
asunder
and
never
appear
to
have
travelled
together
any
more
they
continued
however
each
to
serve
in
the
cause
of
christ
though
they
could
not
walk
together
barnabas
took
john
and
sailed
to
cyprus
his
native
island
and
paul
took
silas
and
went
through
syria
and
cilicia
to
derbe
and
lystra
cities
where
he
and
barnabas
had
preached
in
their
first
excursion
here
they
found
timothy
a
promising
young
man
whom
they
encouraged
to
engage
in
the
ministry
paul
being
now
at
lystra
which
was
the
boundary
of
his
first
excursion
and
having
visited
the
churches
already
planted
and
delivered
to
them
the
decrees
of
the
apostles
and
elders
relating
to
circumcision
seems
to
have
felt
his
heart
enlarged
and
assayed
to
carry
on
the
glorious
work
of
preaching
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
to
a
greater
extent
with
silas
and
timotheus
he
in
his
second
journey
took
a
western
direction
passing
through
phrygia
and
the
region
of
galatia
having
preached
the
word
in
these
parts
with
considerable
success
he
and
his
companions
wished
to
have
gone
into
the
proconsular
asia
and
afterwards
assayed
to
go
into
bythinia
but
begin
forbidden
of
the
holy
ghost
who
seems
to
have
had
a
special
design
of
employing
them
elsewhere
passing
by
mysia
they
came
down
to
troas
on
the
here
a
vision
appeared
to
paul
in
which
he
was
invited
to
go
over
to
macedonia
obedient
to
the
heavenly
vision
and
greatly
encouraged
by
it
they
with
all
speed
crossed
the
egean
sea
and
passing
through
the
island
of
samothracia
landed
at
neapolis
and
went
from
thence
to
philippi
the
chief
city
of
that
part
of
macedonia
it
was
here
that
paul
preached
on
a
sabbath
day
to
a
few
women
by
a
river
side
and
lydia
a
woman
of
thyatira
was
converted
and
baptized
and
her
household
with
her
it
was
here
that
a
poor
girl
who
brought
her
employers
considerable
profit
by
foretelling
events
followed
the
apostles
had
her
spirit
of
divination
ejected
on
which
account
her
masters
were
much
irritated
and
raised
a
tumult
the
effect
of
which
was
that
paul
and
silas
were
imprisoned
but
even
this
was
for
the
success
of
the
gospel
in
that
the
keeper
of
the
prison
and
all
his
house
were
thereby
brought
to
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
were
baptized

from

they
passed
thorough
amphipolis
apollonia
thessalonica
now
salonichi
berea
athens
and
corinth
preaching
the
gospel
wherever
they
went
from
hence
paul
took
ship
and
sailed
to
syria
only
giving
a
short
call
at
ephesus
determining
to
be
at
jerusalem
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
and
having
saluted
the
church
he
came
to
cesarea
and
from
thence
to
antioch
here
ended
paul
second
journey
which
was
very
extensive
and
took
up
some
years
of
his
time
he
and
his
companions
met
with
their
difficulties
in
it
but
had
likewise
their
encouragements
they
were
persecuted
at
philippi
as
already
noticed
and
generally
found
the
jews
to
be
their
most
inveterate
enemies
these
would
raise
tumults
inflame
the
minds
of
the
gentiles
against
them
and
follow
them
from
place
to
place
doing
them
all
the
mischief
in
their
power
this
was
the
case
especially
at
thessalonica
berea
and
corinth
but
amidst
all
their
persecutions
god
was
with
them
and
strengthened
them
in
various
ways
at
berea
they
were
candidly
received
and
their
doctrine
fairly
tried
by
the
holy
scriptures
and
it
is
said
of
them
at
other
places
though
they
affected
to
despise
the
apostle
yet
some
clave
unto
him
at
opposition
rose
to
a
great
height
but
the
lord
appeared
to
his
servant
in
a
vision
saying
not
afraid
but
speak
and
hold
not
thy
peace
for
i
am
with
thee
and
no
man
shall
set
on
thee
to
hurt
thee
for
i
have
much
people
in
this
and
the
promise
was
abundantly
made
good
in
the
spirit
discovered
by
gallio
the
proconsul
who
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
accusations
of
the
jews
and
nobly
declined
interfering
in
matters
beside
his
province
upon
the
whole
a
number
of
churches
were
planted
during
this
journey
which
for
ages
after
shone
as
lights
in
the
world
when
paul
had
visited
antioch
and
spent
some
time
there
he
prepared
for
a
third
journey
into
heathen
countries
the
account
of
which
begins
acts
xviii
and
ends
chap
xxi
at
his
first
setting
out
he
went
over
the
whole
country
of
galatia
and
phrygia
in
order
strengthening
all
the
disciples
and
passing
through
the
upper
coasts
came
to
ephesus
there
for
the
space
of
three
months
he
boldly
preached
in
the
jewish
synagogue
disputing
and
persuading
the
things
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god
but
when
the
hardened
jews
had
openly
rejected
the
gospel
and
spake
evil
of
that
way
before
the
multitude
paul
openly
separated
the
disciples
from
them
and
assembled
in
the
school
of
one
tyrannus
this
it
is
said
continued
for
the
space
of
two
years
that
all
they
who
dwelt
the
proconsular
heard
the
word
of
the
lord
jesus
both
jews
and
certain
magicians
about
this
time
were
exposed
and
others
converted
who
burnt
their
books
and
confessed
their
deeds
so
mightily
grew
the
word
of
the
lord
and
prevailed
after
this
an
uproar
being
raised
by
demetrius
the
silversmith
paul
went
into
macedonia
visited
the
churches
planted
in
his
former
journey
and
from
thence
passed
into
greece
having
preached
up
and
down
for
three
months
he
thought
of
sailing
from
thence
directly
to
syria
but
in
order
to
avoid
the
jews
who
laid
wait
for
him
near
the
sea
coast
he
took
another
course
through
macedonia
and
from
thence
to
troas
by
the
way
of
philippi
there
is
no
mention
made
in
his
former
journey
of
his
having
preached
at
troas
yet
it
seems
he
did
and
a
church
was
gathered
with
whom
the
apostle
at
this
time
united
in
of
it
was
here
that
he
preached
all
night
and
raised
eutychus
who
being
overcome
with
sleep
had
fallen
down
and
was
taken
up
dead
from
hence
they
set
sail
for
syria
and
in
their
way
called
at
miletus
where
paul
sent
for
the
elders
of
the
church
of
ephesus
and
delivered
that
most
solemn
and
affectionate
farewell
recorded
in
the
chapter
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
from
hence
they
sailed
for
tyre
where
they
tarried
seven
days
and
from
thence
proceeded
to
jerusalem
paul
fourth
and
last
journey
or
rather
voyage
was
to
rome
where
he
went
in
the
character
of
a
prisoner
for
being
at
jerusalem
he
was
quickly
apprehended
by
the
jews
but
being
rescued
by
lysias
the
chief
captain
he
was
sent
to
cesarea
to
take
his
trial
here
he
made
his
defence
before
felix
and
drusilla
in
such
sort
that
the
judge
instead
of
the
prisoner
was
made
to
tremble
here
also
he
made
his
defence
before
festus
agrippa
and
bernice
with
such
force
of
evidence
that
agrippa
was
almost
persuaded
to
be
a
christian
but
the
malice
of
the
jews
being
insatiable
and
paul
finding
himself
in
danger
of
being
delivered
into
their
hands
was
constrained
to
appeal
unto
caesar
this
was
the
occasion
of
his
being
sent
to
rome
where
he
arrived
after
a
long
and
dangerous
voyage
and
being
shipwrecked
on
the
island
of
melita
where
he
wrought
miracles
and
publius
the
governor
was
converted
when
he
arrived
at
rome
he
addressed
his
countrymen
the
jews
some
of
whom
believed
but
when
others
rejected
the
gospel
he
turned
from
them
to
the
gentiles
and
for
two
whole
years
dwelt
in
his
own
hired
house
preaching
the
kingdom
of
god
and
teaching
those
things
which
concern
the
lord
jesus
christ
with
all
confidence

of

to
have

engaged

and

their
labours
were
evidently
very
extensive
and
very
successful
so
that
pliny
the
younger
who
lived
soon
after
the
death
of
the
apostles
in
a
letter
to
the
emperor
trajan
observed
that
christianity
had
spread
not
only
through
towns
and
cities
but
also
through
whole
countries
indeed
before
this
in
the
time
of
nero
it
was
so
prevalent
that
it
was
thought
necessary
to
oppose
it
by
an
imperial
edict
and
accordingly
the
proconsuls
and
other
governors
were
commissioned
to
destroy
it
justin
martyr
who
lived
about
the
middle
of
the
second
century
in
his
dialogue
with
trypho
observed
that
there
was
no
part
of
mankind
whether
greeks
or
barbarians
or
any
others
by
what
name
soever
they
were
called
whether
the
sarmatians
or
the
nomades
who
had
no
houses
or
the
scenites
of
arabia
petrea
who
lived
in
tents
among
their
cattle
where
supplications
and
thanksgivings
are
not
offered
up
to
the
father
and
maker
of
all
things
through
the
name
of
jesus
christ
irenaeus
who
lived
about
the
year
speaks
of
churches
that
were
founded
in
germany
spain
france
the
eastern
countries
egypt
lybia
and
the
middle
of
the
world
tertullian
who
lived
and
wrote
at
carthage
in
africa
about
twenty
years
afterwards
enumerating
the
countries
where
christianity
had
penetrated
makes
mention
of
the
parthians
medes
elamites
mesopotamians
armenians
phrygians
cappadocians
the
inhabitants
of
pontus
asia
pamphylia
egypt
and
the
regions
of
africa
beyond
cyrene
the
romans
and

formerly
of
jerusalem
many
of
the

many
borders
of
the
mauri
or
moors
in
mauritania
now
barbary
morocco
all
the
borders
of
spain
many
nations
of
the
gauls
and
the
places
in
britain
which
were
inaccessible
to
the
romans
the
dacians
sarmatians
germans
scythians
and
the
inhabitants
of
many
hidden
nations
and
provinces
and
of
many
islands
unknown
to
him
and
which
he
could
not
enumerate
the
labours
of
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
in
this
early
period
were
so
remarkably
blessed
of
god
that
the
last
mentioned
writer
observed
in
a
letter
to
scapula
that
if
he
began
a
persecution
the
city
of
carthage
itself
must
be
decimated
thereby
yea
and
so
abundant
were
they
in
the
three
first
centuries
that
ten
years
constant
and
almost
universal
persecution
under
dioclesian
could
neither
root
out
the
christians
nor
prejudice
their
cause
after
this
they
had
great
encouragement
under
several
emperors
particularly
constantine
and
theodosius
and
a
very
great
work
of
god
was
carried
on
but
the
ease
and
affluence
which
in
these
times
attended
the
church
served
to
introduce
a
flood
of
corruption
which
by
degrees
brought
on
the
whole
system
of
popery
by
means
of
which
all
appeared
to
be
lost
again
and
satan
set
up
his
kingdom
of
darkness
deceit
and
human
authority
over
conscience
through
all
the
christian
world
in
the
time
of
constantine
one
frumentius
was
sent
to
preach
to
the
indians
and
met
with
great
success
a
young
woman
who
was
a
christian
being
taken
captive
by
the
iberians
or
georgians
near
the
caspian
sea
informed
them
of
the
truths
of
christianity
and
was
so
much
regarded
that
they
sent
to
constantine
for
ministers
to
come
and
preach
the
word
to
them
about
the
same
time
some
barbarous
nations
having
made
irruptions
into
thrace
carried
away
several
christians
captive
who
preached
the
gospel
by
which
means
the
inhabitants
upon
the
rhine
and
the
danube
the
celtae
and
some
other
parts
of
gaul
were
brought
to
embrace
christianity
about
this
time
also
james
of
nisbia
went
into
persia
to
strengthen
the
christians
and
preach
to
the
heathens
and
his
success
was
so
great
that
adiabene
was
almost
entirely
christian
about
the
year
one
moses
a
monk
went
to
preach
to
the
saracens
who
then
lived
in
arabia
where
he
had
great
success
and
at
this
time
the
goths
and
other
northern
nations
had
the
kingdom
of
christ
further
extended
amongst
them
but
which
was
very
soon
corrupted
with
arianism
soon
after
this
the
kingdom
of
christ
was
further
extended
among
the
scythian
nomades
beyond
the
danube
and
about
the
year
a
people
called
the
burgundians
received
the
gospel
four
years
after
that
palladius
was
sent
to
preach
in
scotland
and
the
next
year
patrick
was
sent
from
scotland
to
preach
to
the
irish
who
before
his
time
were
totally
uncivilized
and
some
say
cannibals
he
however
was
useful
and
laid
the
foundations
of
several
churches
in
ireland
presently
after
this
truth
spread
further
among
the
saracens
and
in
zathus
king
of
the
colchians
encouraged
it
and
many
of
that
nation
were
converted
to
christianity
about
this
time
also
the
work
was
extended
in
ireland
by
finian
and
in
scotland
by
constantine
and
columba
the
latter
of
whom
preached
also
to
the
picts
and
brudaeus
their
king
with
several
others
were
converted
about
adad
the
king
of
ethiopia
was
converted
by
the
preaching
of
mansionarius
the
heruli
beyond
the
danube
were
now
made
obedient
to
the
faith
and
the
abasgi
near
the
caucasian
mountains
but
now
popery
especially
the
compulsive
part
of
it
was
risen
to
such
an
height
that
the
usual
method
of
propagating
the
gospel
or
rather
what
was
so
called
was
to
conquer
pagan
nations
by
force
of
arms
and
then
oblige
them
to
submit
to
christianity
after
which
bishopricks
were
erected
and
persons
then
sent
to
instruct
the
people
i
shall
just
mention
some
of
those
who
are
said
to
have
laboured
thus
in
austin
the
monk
melitus
justus
paulinus
and
russinian
laboured
in
england
and
in
their
way
were
very
successful
paulinus
who
appears
to
have
been
one
of
the
best
of
them
had
great
success
in
northumberland
birinnius
preached
to
the
west
saxons
and
felix
to
the
east
angles
in

laboured
in

in
boniface
or
winifred
among
the
thuringians
near
erford
in
saxony
and
willibroad
in
charlemagne
conquered
hungary
in
the
year
and
obliged
the
inhabitants
to
profess
christianity
when
modestus
likewise
preached
to
the
venedi
at
the
source
of
the
save
and
drave
in
ansgarius
preached
in
denmark
gaudibert
in

and
about
methodius
and
cyril
in
bohemia
about
the
year
the
scythians
bulgaria
and
christianity
was
extirpated
but
about
they
were
poland
began
to
be
brought
over
about
the
same
time
and
afterwards
about
or
the
work
was
further
extended
amongst
the
poles
and
prussians
the
work
was
begun
in
norway
in
and
in
muscovy
in
the
swedes
propagated
christianity
in
finland
in
lithuania
became
christian
in
and
samogitia
in
the
spaniards
forced
popery
upon
the
inhabitants
of
and
the
portuguese
in
asia
the
jesuits
were
sent
into
china
in
xavier
whom
they
call
the
apostle
of
the
indians
laboured
in
the
and
japan
from
to
and
several
millions
of
capauchins
were
sent
to
africa
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
blind
zeal
gross
superstition
and
infamous
cruelties
so
marked
the
appearances
of
religion
all
this
time
that
the
professors
of
christianity
needed
conversion
as
much
as
the
heathen
world
a
few
pious
people
had
fled
from
the
general
corruption
and
lived
obscurely
in
the
vallies
of
piedmont
and
savoy
who
were
like
the
seed
of
the
church
some
of
them
were
now
and
then
necessitated
to
travel
into
other
parts
where
they
faithfully
testified
against
the
corruptions
of
the
times
about
wickliffe
began
to
preach
the
faith
in
england
and
his
preaching
and
writings
were
the
means
of
the
conversion
of
great
numbers
many
of
whom
became
excellent
preachers
and
a
work
was
begun
which
afterwards
spread
in
england
hungary
bohemia
germany
switzerland
and
many
other
places
john
huss
and
jerom
of
prague
preached
boldly
and
successfully
in
bohemia
and
the
adjacent
parts
in
the
following
century
luther
calvin
melancton
bucer
martyr
and
many
others
stood
up
against
all
the
rest
of
the
world
they
preached
and
prayed
and
wrote
and
nations
agreed
one
after
another
to
cast
off
the
yoke
of
popery
and
to
embrace
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
in
england
episcopal
tyranny
succeeded
to
popish
cruelty
which
in
the
year
obliged
many
pious
people
to
leave
their
native
land
and
settle
in
america
these
were
followed
by
others
in
who
laid
the
foundations
of
several
gospel
churches
which
have
increased
amazingly
since
that
time
and
the
redeemer
has
fixed
his
throne
in
that
country
where
but
a
little
time
ago
satan
had
universal
dominion
in
elliot
of
a
very
pious
and
zealous
minister
began
to
preach
to
the
indians
among
whom
he
had
great
success
several
churches
of
indians
were
planted
and
some
preachers
and
raised
up
amongst
them
since
which
time
others
have
laboured
amongst
them
with
some
good
encouragement
about
the
year
david
brainerd
was
sent
a
missionary
to
some
more
indians
where
he
preached
and
prayed
and
after
some
time
an
extraordinary
work
of
conversion
was
wrought
and
wonderful
success
attended
his
ministry
and
at
this
present
time
kirkland
and
mr
sergeant
are
employed
in
the
same
good
work
and
god
has
considerably
blessed
their
labours
in
the
king
of
denmark
sent
a
ziegenbalg
and
some
others
to
tranquebar
on
the
coromandel
coast
in
the
who
were
useful
to
the
natives
so
that
many
of
the
heathens
were
turned
to
the
lord
the
dutch
company
likewise
having
extended
their
commerce
built
the
city
of
batavia
and
a
church
was
opened
there
and
the
lord
supper
was
administered
for
the
first
time
on
the
of
january
by
their
minister
james
hulzibos
from
hence
some
ministers
were
sent
to
amboyna
who
were
very
successful
a
seminary
of
learning
was
erected
at
leyden
in
which
ministers
and
assistants
were
educated
under
the
renowned
and
some
years
a
great
number
were
sent
to
the
east
at
the
company
expence
so
that
in
a
little
time
many
thousands
at
formosa
malabar
ternate
jaffanapatnam
in
the
town
of
columba
at
amboyna
java
banda
macassar
and
malabar
embraced
the
religion
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
work
has
decayed
in
some
places
but
they
now
have
churches
in
ceylon
sumatra
java
amboyna
and
some
other
of
the
spice
islands
and
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
africa
but
none
of
the
moderns
have
equalled
the
moravian
brethren
in
this
good
work
they
have
sent
missions
to
greenland
labrador
and
several
of
the
islands
which
have
been
blessed
for
good
they
have
likewise
sent
to
abyssinia
in

what
success
they
have
had
i

this
as
nearly
as
i
can
obtain
information
is
the
state
of
the
world
though
in
many
countries
as
turkey
arabia
great
tartary
africa
and
america
except
the
united
states
and
most
of
the
asiatic
islands
we
have
no
accounts
of
the
number
of
inhabitants
that
can
be
relied
on
i
have
therefore
only
calculated
the
extent
and
counted
a
certain
number
on
an
average
upon
a
square
mile
in
some
countries
more
and
in
others
less
according
as
circumstances
determine
a
few
general
remarks
upon
it
will
conclude
this
section
first
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
according
to
this
calculation
amount
to
about
seven
hundred
and
millions
four
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
whom
are
still
in
pagan
darkness
an
hundred
and
thirty
millions
the
followers
of
mahomet
an
hundred
millions
catholics
millions
protestants
thirty
millions
of
the
greek
and
armenian
churches
and
perhaps
seven
millions
of
jews
it
must
undoubtedly
strike
every
considerate
mind
what
a
vast
proportion
of
the
sons
of
adam
there
are
who
yet
remain
in
the
most
deplorable
state
of
heathen
darkness
without
any
means
of
knowing
the
true
god
except
what
are
afforded
them
by
the
works
of
nature
and
utterly
destitute
of
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
of
christ
or
of
any
means
of
obtaining
it
in
many
of
these
countries
they
have
no
written
language
consequently
no
bible
and
are
only
led
by
the
most
childish
customs
and
traditions
such
for
instance
are
all
the
middle
and
back
parts
of
north
america
the
inland
parts
of
south
america
the
islands
new
holland
new
zealand
new
guinea
and
i
may
add
great
tartary
siberia
samojedia
and
the
other
parts
of
asia
contiguous
to
the
frozen
sea
the
greatest
part
of
africa
the
island
of
madagascar
and
many
places
beside
in
many
of
these
parts
also
they
are
cannibals
feeding
upon
the
flesh
of
their
slain
enemies
with
the
greatest
brutality
and
eagerness
the
truth
of
this
was
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
late
eminent
navigator
cooke
of
the
new
zealanders
and
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
western
coast
of
america
human
sacrifices
are
also
very
frequently
offered
so
that
scarce
a
week
elapses
without
instances
of
this
kind
they
are
in
general
poor
barbarous
naked
pagans
as
destitute
of
civilization
as
they
are
of
true
religion
secondly
barbarous
as
these
poor
heathens
are
they
appear
to
be
as
capable
of
knowledge
as
we
are
and
in
many
places
at
least
have
discovered
uncommon
genius
and
tractableness
and
i
greatly
question
whether
most
of
the
barbarities
practiced
by
them
have
not
originated
in
some
real
or
supposed
affront
and
are
therefore
more
properly
acts
of
than
proofs
of
inhuman
and
dispositions
thirdly
in
other
parts
where
they
have
a
written
language
as
in
the
china
japan
they
know
nothing
of
the
gospel
the
jesuits
indeed
once
made
many
converts
to
popery
among
the
chinese
but
their
highest
aim
seemed
to
be
to
obtain
their
good
opinion
for
though
the
converts
professed
themselves
christians
yet
they
were
allowed
to
honour
the
image
of
confucius
their
great
and
at
length
their
ambitious
intrigues
brought
upon
them
the
displeasure
of
government
which
terminated
in
the
suppression
of
the
mission
and
almost
if
not
entirely
of
the
christian
name
it
is
also
a
melancholy
fact
that
the
vices
of
europeans
have
been
communicated
wherever
they
themselves
have
been
so
that
the
religious
state
of
even
heathens
has
been
rendered
worse
by
intercourse
with
them
fourthly
a
very
great
proportion
of
asia
and
africa
with
some
part
of
europe
are
and
those
in
persia
who
are
of
the
sect
of
are
the
most
inveterate
enemies
to
the
turks
and
they
in
return
abhor
the
persians
the
africans
are
some
of
the
most
ignorant
of
all
the
mahometans
especially
the
arabs
who
are
scattered
through
all
the
northern
parts
of
africa
and
live
upon
the
depredations
which
they
are
continually
making
upon
their
neighbours
fifthly
in
respect
to
those
who
bear
the
christian
name
a
very
great
degree
of
ignorance
and
immorality
abounds
amongst
them
there
are
christians
so
called
of
the
greek
and
armenian
churches
in
all
the
mahometan
countries
but
they
are
if
possible
more
ignorant
and
vicious
than
the
mahometans
themselves
the
georgian
christians
who
are
near
the
caspian
sea
maintain
themselves
by
selling
their
neighbours
relations
and
children
for
slaves
to
the
turks
and
persians
and
it
is
remarked
that
if
any
of
the
greeks
of
anatolia
turn
mussulmen
the
turks
never
set
any
store
by
them
on
account
of
their
being
so
much
noted
for
dissimulation
and
hypocrisy
it
is
well
known
that
most
of
the
members
of
the
greek
church
are
very
ignorant
papists
also
are
in
general
ignorant
of
divine
things
and
very
vicious
nor
do
the
bulk
of
the
church
of
england
much
exceed
them
either
in
knowledge
or
holiness
and
many
errors
and
much
looseness
of
conduct
are
to
be
found
amongst
dissenters
of
all
denominations
the
lutherans
in
denmark
are
much
on
a
par
with
the
ecclesiastics
in
england
and
the
face
of
most
christian
countries
presents
a
dreadful
scene
of
ignorance
hypocrisy
and
profligacy
various
baneful
and
pernicious
errors
appear
to
gain
ground
in
almost
every
part
of
christendom
the
truths
of
the
gospel
and
even
the
gospel
itself
are
attacked
and
every
method
that
the
enemy
can
invent
is
employed
to
undermine
the
kingdom
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
all
these
things
are
loud
calls
to
christians
and
especially
to
ministers
to
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
in
their
several
spheres
of
action
and
to
try
to
enlarge
them
as
much
as
possible
sect
iv
practicability
of
something
being
done
more
than
what
is
done
for
the
conversion
of
the
the
impediments
in
the
way
of
carrying
the
gospel
among
the
heathen
must
arise
i
think
from
one
or
other
of
the
following
things
either
their
distance
from
us
their
barbarous
and
savage
manner
of
living
the
danger
of
being
killed
by
them
the
difficulty
of
procuring
the
necessaries
of
life
or
the
unintelligibleness
of
their
languages
first
as
to
their
distance
from
us
whatever
objections
might
have
been
made
on
that
account
before
the
invention
of
the
compass
nothing
can
be
alledged
for
it
with
any
colour
of
plausibility
in
the
present
age
men
can
now
sail
with
as
much
certainty
through
the
great
south
sea
as
they
can
through
the
mediterranean
or
any
lesser
sea
yea
and
providence
seems
in
a
manner
to
invite
us
to
the
trial
as
there
are
to
our
knowledge
trading
companies
whose
commerce
lies
in
many
of
the
places
where
these
barbarians
dwell
at
one
time
or
other
ships
are
sent
to
visit
places
of
more
recent
discovery
and
to
explore
parts
the
most
unknown
and
every
fresh
account
of
their
ignorance
or
cruelty
should
call
forth
our
pity
and
excite
us
to
concur
with
providence
in
seeking
their
eternal
good
scripture
likewise
seems
to
point
out
this
method
the
isles
shall
wait
for
me
the
ships
of
tarshish
first
to
bring
my
sons
from
far
their
silver
and
their
gold
with
them
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
isai
lx
this
seems
to
imply
that
in
the
time
of
the
glorious
increase
of
the
church
in
the
latter
days
of
which
the
whole
chapter
is
undoubtedly
a
prophecy
commerce
shall
subserve
the
spread
of
the
gospel
the
ships
of
tarshish
were
trading
vessels
which
made
voyages
for
traffic
to
various
parts
thus
much
therefore
must
be
meant
by
it
that
especially
that
which
is
shall
be
one
great
mean
of
carrying
on
the
work
of
god
and
perhaps
it
may
imply
that
there
shall
be
a
very
considerable
appropriation
of
wealth
to
that
purpose
secondly
as
to
their
uncivilized
and
barbarous
way
of
living
this
can
be
no
objection
to
any
except
those
whose
love
of
ease
renders
them
unwilling
to
expose
themselves
to
inconveniencies
for
the
good
of
others
it
was
no
objection
to
the
apostles
and
their
successors
who
went
among
the
barbarous
and
and
still
more
barbarous
they
did
not
wait
for
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
these
countries
to
be
civilized
before
they
could
be
christianized
but
went
simply
with
the
doctrine
of
the
cross
and
tertullian
could
boast
that
those
parts
of
britain
which
were
proof
against
the
roman
armies
were
conquered
by
the
gospel
of
christ
it
was
no
objection
to
an
elliot
or
a
brainerd
in
later
times
they
went
forth
and
encountered
every
difficulty
of
the
kind
and
found
that
a
cordial
reception
of
the
gospel
produced
those
happy
effects
which
the
longest
intercourse
with
europeans
without
it
could
never
accomplish
it
no
objection
to
commercial
men
it
only
requires
that
we
should
have
as
much
love
to
the
souls
of
our
and
fellow
sinners
as
they
have
for
the
profits
arising
from
a
few
and
all
these
difficulties
would
be
easily
surmounted
after
all
the
uncivilized
state
of
the
heathen
instead
of
affording
an
objection
preaching
the
gospel
to
them
ought
to
furnish
an
argument
it
can
we
as
men
or
as
christians
hear
that
a
great
part
of
our
fellow
creatures
whose
souls
are
as
immortal
as
ours
and
who
are
as
capable
as
ourselves
of
adorning
the
gospel
and
contributing
by
their
preaching
writings
or
practices
to
the
glory
of
our
redeemer
name
and
the
good
of
his
church
are
inveloped
in
ignorance
and
barbarism
can
we
hear
that
they
are
without
the
gospel
without
government
without
laws
and
without
arts
and
sciences
and
not
exert
ourselves
to
introduce
amongst
them
the
sentiments
of
men
and
of
christians
would
not
the
spread
of
the
gospel
be
the
most
effectual
mean
of
their
civilization
would
not
that
make
them
useful
members
of
society
we
know
that
such
effects
did
in
a
measure
follow
the
efforts
of
and
others
amongst
the
american
indians
and
if
similar
attempts
were
made
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
succeeded
with
a
divine
blessing
which
we
have
every
reason
to
think
they
would
might
we
not
expect
to
see
able
divines
or
read
treatises
in
defence
of
the
truth
even
amongst
those
who
at
present
seem
to
be
scarcely
human
thirdly
respect
to
the
danger
of
being
killed
by
it
is
true
that
whoever
does
go
must
put
his
life
in
his
hand
and
not
consult
with
flesh
and
blood
but
do
not
the
goodness
of
the
cause
the
duties
incumbent
on
us
as
the
creatures
of
god
and
christians
and
the
perishing
state
of
our
fellow
men
loudly
call
upon
us
to
venture
all
and
use
every
warrantable
exertion
for
their
benefit
paul
and
barnabas
who
their
lives
for
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
were
not
blamed
as
being
rash
but
commended
for
so
doing
while
john
mark
who
through
timidity
of
mind
deserted
them
in
their
perilous
undertaking
was
branded
with
censure
after
all
as
has
been
already
observed
i
greatly
question
whether
most
of
the
barbarities
practiced
by
the
savages
upon
those
who
have
visited
them
have
not
originated
in
some
real
or
supposed
affront
and
were
therefore
more
properly
acts
of
than
proofs
of
ferocious
dispositions
no
wonder
if
the
imprudence
of
sailors
should
prompt
them
to
offend
the
simple
savage
and
the
offence
be
resented
but
and
the
have
been
very
seldom
molested
nay
in
general
the
heathen
have
shewed
a
willingness
to
hear
the
word
and
have
principally
expressed
their
hatred
of
christianity
on
account
of
the
vices
of
nominal
christians
fourthly
to
the
difficulty
of
procuring
the
necessaries
of
this
would
not
be
so
great
as
may
appear
at
first
sight
for
though
we
could
not
procure
european
food
yet
we
might
procure
such
as
the
natives
of
those
countries
which
we
visit
subsist
upon
themselves
and
this
would
only
be
passing
through
what
we
have
virtually
engaged
in
by
entering
on
the
ministerial
office
a
christian
minister
is
a
person
who
in
a
peculiar
sense
is
his
he
is
the
of
god
and
therefore
ought
to
be
wholly
devoted
to
him
by
entering
on
that
sacred
office
he
solemnly
undertakes
to
be
always
engaged
as
much
as
possible
in
the
lord
work
and
not
to
chuse
his
own
pleasure
or
employment
or
pursue
the
ministry
as
a
something
that
is
to
subserve
his
own
ends
or
interests
or
as
a
kind
of
he
engages
to
go
where
god
pleases
and
to
do
or
endure
what
he
sees
fit
to
command
or
call
him
to
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
he
virtually
bids
farewell
to
friends
pleasures
and
comforts
and
stands
in
readiness
to
endure
the
greatest
sufferings
in
the
work
of
his
lord
and
master
it
is
inconsistent
for
ministers
to
please
themselves
with
thoughts
of
a
numerous
auditory
cordial
friends
a
civilized
country
legal
protection
affluence
splendor
or
even
a
competency
the
flights
and
hatred
of
men
and
even
pretended
friends
gloomy
prisons
and
tortures
the
society
of
barbarians
of
uncouth
speech
miserable
accommodations
in
wretched
wildernesses
hunger
and
thirst
nakedness
weariness
and
painfulness
hard
work
and
but
little
worldly
encouragement
should
rather
be
the
objects
of
their
expectation
thus
the
apostles
acted
in
the
primitive
times
and
endured
hardness
as
good
soldiers
of
jesus
christ
and
though
we
living
in
a
civilized
country
where
christianity
is
protected
by
law
are
not
called
to
suffer
these
things
while
we
continue
here
yet
i
question
whether
all
are
justified
in
staying
here
while
so
many
are
perishing
without
means
of
grace
in
other
lands
sure
i
am
that
it
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
for
its
ministers
to
enter
upon
it
from
interested
motives
or
with
great
worldly
expectations
on
the
contrary
the
commission
is
a
sufficient
call
to
them
to
venture
all
and
like
the
primitive
christians
go
every
where
preaching
the
gospel
it
might
be
necessary
however
for
two
at
least
to
go
together
and
in
general
i
should
think
it
best
that
they
should
be
married
men
and
to
prevent
their
time
from
being
employed
in
procuring
necessaries
two
or
more
other
persons
with
their
wives
and
families
might
also
accompany
them
who
should
be
wholly
employed
in
providing
for
them
in
most
countries
it
would
be
necessary
for
them
to
cultivate
a
little
spot
of
ground
just
for
their
support
which
would
be
a
resource
to
them
whenever
their
supplies
failed
not
to
mention
the
advantages
they
would
reap
from
each
others
company
it
would
take
off
the
enormous
expence
which
has
always
attended
undertakings
of
this
kind
the
first
expence
being
the
whole
for
though
a
large
colony
needs
support
for
a
considerable
time
yet
so
small
a
number
would
upon
receiving
the
first
crop
maintain
themselves
they
would
have
the
advantage
of
choosing
their
situation
their
wants
would
be
few
the
women
and
even
the
children
would
be
necessary
for
domestic
purposes
and
a
few
articles
of
stock
as
a
cow
or
two
and
a
bull
and
a
few
other
cattle
of
both
sexes
a
very
few
utensils
of
husbandry
and
some
corn
to
sow
their
land
would
be
sufficient
those
who
attend
the
missionaries
should
understand
husbandry
fishing
fowling
and
be
provided
with
the
necessary
implements
for
these
purposes
indeed
a
variety
of
methods
may
be
thought
of
and
when
once
the
work
is
undertaken
many
things
will
suggest
themselves
to
us
of
which
we
at
present
can
form
no
idea
fifthly
as
to
their
the
same
means
would
be
found
necessary
here
as
in
trade
between
different
nations
in
some
cases
interpreters
might
be
obtained
who
might
be
employed
for
a
time
and
where
these
were
not
to
be
found
the
missionaries
must
have
patience
and
mingle
with
the
people
till
they
have
learned
so
much
of
their
language
as
to
be
able
to
communicate
their
ideas
to
them
in
it
it
is
well
known
to
require
no
very
extraordinary
talents
to
learn
in
the
space
of
a
year
or
two
at
most
the
language
of
any
people
upon
earth
so
much
of
it
at
least
as
to
be
able
to
convey
any
sentiments
we
wish
to
their
understandings
the
missionaries
must
be
men
of
great
piety
prudence
courage
and
forbearance
of
undoubted
orthodoxy
in
their
sentiments
and
must
enter
with
all
their
hearts
into
the
spirit
of
their
mission
they
must
be
willing
to
leave
all
the
comforts
of
life
behind
them
and
to
encounter
all
the
hardships
of
a
torrid
or
a
frigid
climate
an
uncomfortable
manner
of
living
and
every
other
inconvenience
that
can
attend
this
undertaking
clothing
a
few
knives
powder
and
shot
and
the
articles
of
husbandry
must
be
provided
for
them
and
when
arrived
at
the
place
of
their
destination
their
first
business
must
be
to
gain
some
acquaintance
with
the
language
of
the
natives
for
which
purpose
two
would
be
better
than
one
and
by
all
lawful
means
to
endeavour
to
cultivate
a
friendship
with
them
and
as
soon
as
possible
let
them
know
the
errand
for
which
they
were
sent
they
must
endeavour
to
convince
them
that
it
was
their
good
alone
which
induced
them
to
forsake
their
friends
and
all
the
comforts
of
their
native
country
they
must
be
very
careful
not
to
resent
injuries
which
may
be
offered
to
them
nor
to
think
highly
of
themselves
so
as
to
despise
the
poor
heathens
and
by
those
means
lay
a
foundation
for
their
resentment
or
rejection
of
the
gospel
they
must
take
every
opportunity
of
doing
them
good
and
labouring
and
travelling
night
and
day
they
must
instruct
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
long
suffering
and
anxious
desire
for
them
and
above
all
must
be
instant
in
prayer
for
the
effusion
of
the
holy
spirit
upon
the
people
of
their
charge
let
but
missionaries
of
the
above
description
engage
in
the
work
and
we
shall
see
that
it
is
not
impracticable
it
might
likewise
be
of
importance
if
god
should
bless
their
labours
for
them
to
encourage
any
appearances
of
gifts
amongst
the
people
of
their
charge
if
such
should
be
raised
up
many
advantages
would
be
derived
from
their
knowledge
of
the
language
and
customs
of
their
countrymen
and
their
change
of
conduct
would
give
great
weight
to
their
ministrations
sect
enquiry
into
the
duty
of
christians
in
general
and
what
means
ought
to
be
used
in
order
to
promote
this
if
the
prophecies
concerning
the
increase
of
christ
kingdom
be
true
and
if
what
has
been
advanced
concerning
the
commission
given
by
him
to
his
disciples
being
obligatory
on
us
be
just
it
must
be
inferred
that
all
christians
ought
heartily
to
concur
with
god
in
promoting
his
glorious
designs
for
that
is
joined
to
the
lord
is
one
one
of
the
first
and
most
important
of
those
duties
which
are
incumbent
upon
us
is
and
united
however
the
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
may
be
set
at
nought
and
run
down
by
many
it
will
be
found
upon
trial
that
all
means
which
we
can
use
without
it
will
be
ineffectual
if
a
temple
is
raised
for
god
in
the
heathen
world
it
will
not
be
might
nor
by
nor
by
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
or
the
eloquence
of
the
orator
by
my
spirit
saith
the
lord
of
we
must
therefore
be
in
real
earnest
in
supplicating
his
blessing
upon
our
labours
it
is
represented
in
the
prophets
that
when
there
shall
be
great
mourning
in
the
land
as
the
mourning
of
hadadrimmon
in
the
valley
of
megiddon
and
every
family
shall
mourn
apart
and
their
wives
it
shall
all
follow
upon
spirit
of
grace
and
and
when
these
things
shall
take
place
it
is
promised
that
shall
be
a
fountain
opened
for
the
house
of
david
and
for
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
for
sin
and
for
and
that
idols
shall
be
and
false
prophets
of
their
profession
zech
xii
xiii
this
prophesy
seems
to
teach
that
when
there
shall
be
an
universal
conjunction
in
fervent
prayer
and
all
shall
esteem
zion
welfare
as
their
own
then
copious
influences
of
the
spirit
shall
be
shed
upon
the
churches
which
like
a
purifying
shall
cleanse
the
servants
of
the
lord
nor
shall
this
cleansing
influence
stop
here
all
old
idolatrous
prejudices
shall
be
rooted
out
and
truth
prevail
so
gloriously
that
false
teachers
shall
be
so
ashamed
as
rather
to
wish
to
be
classed
with
obscure
herdsmen
or
the
meanest
peasants
than
bear
the
ignominy
attendant
on
their
detection
the
most
glorious
works
of
grace
that
have
ever
took
place
have
been
in
answer
to
prayer
and
it
is
in
this
way
we
have
the
greatest
reason
to
suppose
that
the
glorious
of
the
spirit
which
we
expect
at
last
will
be
bestowed
with
respect
to
our
own
immediate
connections
we
have
within
these
few
years
been
favoured
with
some
tokens
for
good
granted
in
answer
to
prayer
which
should
encourage
us
to
persist
and
increase
in
that
important
duty
i
trust
our
for
the
success
of
the
gospel
have
not
been
in
vain
it
is
true
a
want
of
importunity
too
generally
attends
our
prayers
yet
unimportunate
and
feeble
as
they
have
been
it
is
to
be
believed
that
god
has
heard
and
in
a
measure
answered
them
the
churches
that
have
engaged
in
the
practice
have
in
general
since
that
time
been
evidently
on
the
increase
some
controversies
which
have
long
perplexed
and
divided
the
church
are
more
clearly
stated
than
ever
there
are
calls
to
preach
the
gospel
in
many
places
where
it
has
not
been
usually
published
yea
a
glorious
door
is
opened
and
is
likely
to
be
opened
wider
and
wider
by
the
spread
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
accompanied
also
by
a
diminution
of
the
spirit
of
popery
a
noble
effort
has
been
made
to
abolish
the
inhuman
and
though
at
present
it
has
not
been
so
successful
as
might
be
wished
yet
it
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
be
persevered
in
till
it
is
accomplished
in
the
mean
time
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
consider
that
the
late
defeat
of
the
abolition
of
the
has
proved
the
occasion
of
a
praise
worthy
effort
to
introduce
a
free
settlement
at
on
the
coast
of
africa
an
effort
which
if
succeeded
with
a
divine
blessing
not
only
promises
to
open
a
way
for
honourable
commerce
with
that
extensive
country
and
for
the
civilization
of
its
inhabitants
but
may
prove
the
happy
mean
of
introducing
amongst
them
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
these
are
events
that
ought
not
to
be
they
are
not
to
be
reckoned
small
things
and
yet
perhaps
they
small
compared
with
what
might
have
been
expected
if
all
had
cordially
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
proposal
so
as
to
have
made
the
cause
of
christ
their
own
or
in
other
words
to
have
been
so
solicitous
about
it
as
if
their
own
advantage
depended
upon
its
success
if
an
holy
solicitude
had
prevailed
in
all
the
assemblies
of
christians
in
behalf
of
their
redeemer
kingdom
we
might
probably
have
seen
before
now
not
only
an
for
the
gospel
but
running
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
or
a
diligent
use
of
those
means
which
providence
has
put
in
our
power
accompanied
with
a
greater
blessing
than
ordinary
from
heaven
many
can
do
nothing
but
pray
and
prayer
is
perhaps
the
only
thing
in
which
christians
of
all
denominations
can
cordially
and
unreservedly
unite
but
in
this
we
may
all
be
one
and
in
this
the
strictest
unanimity
ought
to
prevail
were
the
whole
body
thus
animated
by
one
soul
with
what
pleasure
would
christians
attend
on
all
the
duties
of
religion
and
with
what
delight
would
their
ministers
attend
on
all
the
business
of
their
calling
we
must
not
be
contented
however
with
praying
without
ourselves
in
the
use
of
for
the
obtaining
of
those
things
we
pray
for
were
children
of
but
wise
in
their
generation
as
the
children
of
this
they
would
stretch
every
nerve
to
gain
so
glorious
a
prize
nor
ever
imagine
that
it
was
to
be
obtained
in
any
other
way
when
a
trading
company
have
obtained
their
charter
they
usually
go
to
its
utmost
limits
and
their
stocks
their
ships
their
officers
and
men
are
so
chosen
and
regulated
as
to
be
likely
to
answer
their
purpose
but
they
do
not
stop
here
for
encouraged
by
the
prospect
of
success
they
use
every
effort
cast
their
bread
upon
the
waters
cultivate
friendship
with
every
one
from
whose
information
they
expect
the
least
advantage
they
cross
the
widest
and
most
tempestuous
seas
and
encounter
the
most
unfavourable
climates
they
introduce
themselves
into
the
most
barbarous
nations
and
sometimes
undergo
the
most
affecting
hardships
their
minds
continue
in
a
state
of
anxiety
and
suspence
and
a
longer
delay
than
usual
in
the
arrival
of
their
vessels
agitates
them
with
a
thousand
changeful
thoughts
and
foreboding
apprehensions
which
continue
till
the
rich
returns
are
safe
arrived
in
port
but
why
these
fears
whence
all
these
disquietudes
and
this
labour
is
it
not
because
their
souls
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
project
and
their
happiness
in
a
manner
depends
on
its
success
christians
are
a
body
whose
truest
interest
lies
in
the
exaltation
of
the
messiah
kingdom
their
charter
is
very
extensive
their
encouragements
exceeding
great
and
the
returns
promised
infinitely
superior
to
all
the
gains
of
the
most
lucrative
fellowship
let
then
every
one
in
his
station
consider
himself
as
bound
to
act
with
all
his
might
and
in
every
possible
way
for
god
suppose
a
company
of
serious
christians
ministers
and
private
persons
were
to
form
themselves
into
a
society
and
make
a
number
of
rules
respecting
the
regulation
of
the
plan
and
the
persons
who
are
to
be
employed
as
missionaries
the
means
of
defraying
the
expence
this
society
must
consist
of
persons
whose
hearts
are
in
the
work
men
of
serious
religion
and
possessing
a
spirit
of
perseverance
there
must
be
a
determination
not
to
admit
any
person
who
is
not
of
this
description
or
to
retain
him
longer
than
he
answers
to
it
from
such
a
society
a
might
be
appointed
whose
business
it
should
be
to
procure
all
the
information
they
could
upon
the
subject
to
receive
contributions
to
enquire
into
the
characters
tempers
abilities
and
religious
views
of
the
missionaries
and
also
to
provide
them
with
necessaries
for
their
undertakings
they
must
also
pay
a
great
attention
to
the
views
of
those
who
undertake
this
work
for
want
of
this
the
missions
to
the
spice
islands
sent
by
the
dutch
company
were
soon
corrupted
many
going
more
for
the
sake
of
settling
in
a
place
where
temporal
gain
invited
them
than
of
preaching
to
the
poor
indians
this
soon
introduced
a
number
of
indolent
or
profligate
persons
whose
lives
were
a
scandal
to
the
doctrines
which
they
preached
and
by
means
of
whom
the
gospel
was
ejected
from
ternate
in
and
christianity
fell
into
great
disrepute
in
other
places
if
there
is
any
reason
for
me
to
hope
that
i
shall
have
any
influence
upon
any
of
my
brethren
and
fellow
christians
probably
it
may
be
more
especially
amongst
them
of
my
own
denomination
i
would
therefore
propose
that
such
a
society
and
committee
should
be
formed
amongst
the
baptist
i
do
not
mean
by
this
in
any
wife
to
confine
it
to
one
denomination
of
christians
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
every
one
who
loves
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
sincerity
would
in
some
way
or
other
engage
in
it
but
in
the
present
divided
state
of
christendom
it
would
be
more
likely
for
good
to
be
done
by
each
denomination
engaging
separately
in
the
work
than
if
they
were
to
embark
in
it
conjointly
there
is
room
enough
for
us
all
without
interfering
with
each
other
and
if
no
unfriendly
interference
took
place
each
denomination
would
bear
good
will
to
the
other
and
wish
and
pray
for
its
success
considering
it
as
upon
the
whole
friendly
to
the
great
cause
of
true
religion
but
if
all
were
intermingled
it
is
likely
their
private
discords
might
throw
a
damp
upon
their
spirits
and
much
retard
their
public
usefulness
in
respect
to
for
defraying
the
expences
money
will
doubtless
be
wanting
and
suppose
the
rich
were
to
embark
a
portion
of
that
wealth
over
which
god
has
made
them
stewards
in
this
important
undertaking
perhaps
there
are
few
ways
that
would
turn
to
a
better
account
at
last
nor
ought
it
to
be
confined
to
the
if
persons
in
more
moderate
circumstances
were
to
devote
a
portion
suppose
a
of
their
annual
increase
to
the
lord
it
would
not
only
correspond
with
the
practice
of
the
israelites
who
lived
under
the
mosaic
oeconomy
but
of
the
patriarchs
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
before
that
dispensation
commenced
many
of
our
most
eminent
amongst
the
followed
that
practice
and
if
that
were
but
attended
to
now
there
would
not
only
be
enough
to
support
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
at
home
and
to
encourage
in
our
respective
neighbourhoods
but
to
defray
the
expences
of
carrying
the
gospel
into
the
heathen
world
if
congregations
were
to
open
subscriptions
of
or
more
per
week
according
to
their
circumstances
and
deposit
it
as
a
fund
for
the
propogation
of
the
gospel
much
might
be
raised
in
this
way
by
such
simple
means
they
might
soon
have
it
in
their
power
to
introduce
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
into
most
of
the
villages
in
england
where
though
men
are
placed
whose
business
it
should
be
to
give
light
to
those
who
sit
in
darkness
it
is
well
known
that
they
have
it
not
where
there
was
no
person
to
open
his
house
for
the
reception
of
the
gospel
some
other
building
might
be
procured
for
a
small
sum
and
even
then
something
considerable
might
be
spared
for
the
baptist
or
other
committees
for
propogating
the
gospel
amongst
the
heathen
many
persons
have
of
late
left
off
the
use
of
on
account
of
the
iniquitous
manner
in
which
it
is
obtained
those
families
who
have
done
so
and
have
not
substituted
any
thing
else
in
its
place
have
not
only
cleansed
their
hands
of
blood
but
have
made
a
saving
to
their
families
some
of
six
pence
and
some
of
a
shilling
a
week
if
this
or
a
part
of
this
were
appropriated
to
the
uses
it
would
abundantly
suffice
we
have
only
to
keep
the
end
in
view
and
have
our
hearts
thoroughly
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
it
and
means
will
not
be
very
difficult
we
are
exhorted
lay
up
treasure
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
nor
thieves
break
through
and
it
is
also
declared
that
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
these
scriptures
teach
us
that
the
enjoyments
of
the
life
to
come
bear
a
near
relation
to
that
which
now
is
a
relation
similar
to
that
of
the
harvest
and
the
seed
it
is
true
all
the
reward
is
of
mere
grace
but
it
is
nevertheless
encouraging
what
a
what
an
must
await
such
characters
as
paul
and
elliot
and
brainerd
and
others
who
have
given
themselves
wholly
to
the
work
of
the
lord
what
a
heaven
will
it
be
to
see
the
many
myriads
of
poor
heathens
of
britons
amongst
the
rest
who
by
their
labours
have
been
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
god
surely
a
of
like
this
is
worth
aspiring
to
surely
it
is
worth
while
to
lay
ourselves
out
with
all
our
might
in
promoting
the
cause
and
kingdom
of
christ
