this
story
has
a
moral
it
is
leave
well
enough
alone
just
look
what
happened
to
kenzie
mackenzie
who
did
that
kenzie
mackenzie
was
a
mad
scientist
hardly
showed
at
all
to
see
him
ambling
down
the
street
in
loose
jointed
manner
with
sandy
hair
uncombed
blue
eyes
looking
vaguely
beyond
normal
focus
you
might
think
here
was
a
young
fellow
dreaming
over
how
his
gal
looked
last
night
it
might
never
occur
to
you
that
he
was
thinking
of
ants
of
course
we
fellows
in
the
experimental
lab
all
knew
it
but
kenzie
was
too
hard
to
get
along
with
in
fact
he
could
usually
be
counted
on
to
pull
us
out
of
a
technical
hole
we
put
up
with
him
through
a
certain
fondness
maybe
even
a
little
pride
it
gave
us
a
harmless
subject
to
talk
about
when
security
was
too
rigid
on
other
things
our
department
chief
knew
it
but
kenzie
had
solved
quite
a
few
knotty
electronics
problems
the
chief
never
has
been
too
particular
to
see
credit
get
back
to
the
guy
who
earned
it
we
guessed
he
figured
having
kenzie
there
was
profitable
to
him
in
fact
the
little
redhead
in
payroll
told
me
the
chief
was
drawing
quite
a
few
bonus
checks
personnel
probably
did
know
about
it
kenzie
papers
buried
deep
in
the
files
would
show
it
because
about
the
only
question
they
had
asked
us
was
where
do
you
stand
on
the
matter
of
ants
there
was
an
unwritten
law
in
the
lab
for
nobody
ever
to
mention
insects
or
even
elderly
female
relatives
i
guess
that
was
why
it
was
mentioned
to
the
new
guy
name
of
robert
pringle
this
fellow
pringle
worked
along
for
a
couple
weeks
and
showed
us
he
had
the
old
in
his
fingers
a
capable
tech
a
good
joe
and
we
thought
we
were
lucky
to
get
him
on
this
particular
morning
it
happened
that
pringle
was
working
at
the
bench
next
to
kenzie
being
a
talented
tech
like
the
rest
of
us
his
mind
naturally
ran
along
more
than
one
channel
at
the
same
time
i
expect
he
was
really
surprised
at
the
reaction
he
got
when
he
shouted
out
to
the
room
at
large
hey
fellows
he
yelled
i
got
little
green
bugs
on
my
roses
what
do
you
do
about
it
the
silence
made
him
look
up
from
his
work
and
he
could
help
noticing
we
all
stood
there
with
clinched
hands
and
gritted
teeth
we
were
watching
kenzie
who
snapped
the
juice
off
his
soldering
iron
and
pointed
the
iron
at
pringle
those
said
kenzie
in
a
hollow
impressive
voice
are
aphis
if
you
will
look
closer
pringle
you
will
see
among
them
ants
the
aphid
is
to
the
ant
as
the
dairy
cow
is
to
the
human
those
ants
are
aphid
herders
carefully
tending
and
milking
their
flock
here
we
go
again
moaned
one
of
the
fellows
across
the
lab
the
ants
are
a
highly
intelligent
life
form
kenzie
went
on
i
would
explain
it
to
you
in
detail
but
i
am
in
the
middle
of
a
problem
at
this
moment
thank
heaven
for
that
another
tech
ground
out
the
words
suffice
it
to
say
kenzie
ignored
all
interruptions
man
would
well
occupy
himself
trying
to
communicate
with
them
the
chief
came
to
the
doorway
of
his
little
office
down
at
the
end
of
the
lab
he
looked
us
all
over
patiently
and
knowingly
now
give
him
your
syllogism
kenzie
he
said
quietly
so
we
can
all
get
back
to
work
you
may
reflect
on
this
pringle
kenzie
stated
and
waved
his
soldering
iron
in
the
air
one
man
wants
to
communicate
with
intelligent
life
from
other
planets
or
the
stars
two
we
know
from
observation
the
ants
communicate
with
one
another
ergo
before
we
reach
so
far
as
to
contact
extra
terrestrial
intelligence
had
we
not
better
occupy
our
time
with
solving
a
much
simpler
communications
problem
to
wit
communicate
with
the
ants
how
can
we
expect
to
solve
communication
with
really
alien
beings
from
the
stars
when
we
have
not
learned
to
communicate
with
the
intelligent
beings
at
our
very
feet
all
over
the
room
we
sighed
heavily
with
relief
we
knew
the
syllogism
was
the
conclusion
the
sunday
punch
the
boy
had
really
cut
it
short
this
time
usually
he
was
good
for
a
solid
hour
with
facts
and
figures
about
how
ants
built
bridges
and
such
stuff
we
all
looked
at
pringle
face
expecting
to
see
the
embarrassed
and
sheepish
grin
this
was
the
usual
reaction
of
a
stranger
when
he
first
met
up
with
kenzie
syllogism
it
horrified
us
to
see
instead
his
shining
eyes
we
heard
him
say
enthusiastically
that
just
how
i
always
felt
about
it
kenzie
it
a
pleasure
to
meet
a
man
who
is
afraid
of
thinking
oh
we
all
groaned
out
in
a
chorus
only
pringle
said
dubiously
and
our
hopes
began
to
arise
again
only
i
been
thinking
more
along
the
line
of
termites
our
hopes
fell
and
were
shattered
we
heard
the
chief
moan
to
himself
and
saw
him
turn
and
almost
run
back
into
his
office
two
of
now
he
was
mumbling
over
and
over
two
of
now
it
ai
worth
it
it
ai
worth
it
he
sat
down
heavily
and
buried
his
head
in
his
arms
across
the
top
of
his
desk
kenzie
was
watching
him
too
like
he
was
wondering
what
had
got
into
the
chief
then
kenzie
turned
back
to
pringle
ants
he
said
with
determination
termites
pringle
answered
him
stubbornly
kenzie
glared
at
pringle
for
a
minute
then
his
face
cleared
why
not
both
of
them
he
asked
like
a
fellow
who
was
willing
to
be
big
about
it
sure
why
not
pringle
came
his
half
way
also
then
like
he
to
be
outdone
in
generosity
ants
first
then
termites
later
solemnly
the
two
shook
hands
they
went
back
to
their
work
at
the
bench
and
there
was
an
aura
of
understanding
and
accord
at
that
end
of
the
room
thick
enough
to
be
felt
i
hope
you
insect
lovers
will
be
very
happy
together
the
grid
expert
mumbled
to
their
backs
the
rest
of
us
also
settled
back
into
our
varied
jobs
and
problems
but
we
worked
as
if
we
momentarily
expected
an
earthquake
to
rock
us
our
hands
were
not
quite
steady
our
eyes
were
not
firm
and
piercing
we
almost
held
our
breaths
for
a
wonder
we
agreed
with
the
chief
two
of
now
the
days
passed
and
nothing
more
was
said
more
than
ever
now
we
enforced
the
taboo
on
insects
we
did
mention
trees
or
wood
or
even
the
conditional
subjunctive
would
sounded
like
wood
wood
might
bring
up
the
thought
of
termites
we
could
see
the
chief
was
weighing
the
advantages
of
keeping
them
against
the
risks
of
upsetting
the
department
constantly
as
we
expected
greed
won
we
knew
he
would
not
risk
giving
up
the
prestige
and
extra
bonuses
he
got
for
kenzie
work
and
he
knew
he
had
to
keep
those
discoveries
coming
because
our
management
has
a
short
memory
of
what
a
guy
has
done
in
the
past
the
chief
even
let
kenzie
have
pringle
as
his
own
personal
tech
it
served
two
purposes
it
isolated
them
from
the
rest
of
us
it
made
kenzie
happy
i
will
say
for
the
lads
they
spent
most
of
their
time
on
company
problems
at
first
but
gradually
on
one
corner
of
kenzie
bench
a
gadget
began
to
take
shape
the
two
of
them
worked
on
it
when
there
were
no
urgent
frantic
problems
to
be
solved
first
none
of
us
could
figure
out
the
purpose
of
the
mechanism
we
knew
if
we
could
figure
it
the
chief
could
but
we
could
practically
see
him
rub
his
hands
in
glee
when
he
thought
of
the
extra
bonus
he
might
get
for
this
new
gadget
of
course
the
chief
was
a
complete
slouch
as
an
electronics
engineer
but
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
did
his
study
and
he
had
grown
hazy
by
spending
too
many
years
as
an
administrator
the
word
got
around
that
for
hours
at
a
time
after
we
had
gone
home
the
chief
would
stand
at
kenzie
bench
the
way
we
reasoned
it
he
figured
he
ought
to
know
something
about
the
gadget
when
he
took
it
in
to
old
rock
jaw
and
palmed
it
off
as
his
latest
discovery
we
also
reasoned
that
since
we
could
figure
it
the
chief
must
have
been
an
awfully
troubled
man
obviously
it
had
something
to
do
with
microwave
transmission
and
reception
there
was
the
usual
condensor
the
magnatron
tubes
the
tuning
cavities
all
company
stock
of
course
but
then
none
of
us
ever
worried
about
cost
that
was
the
chief
problem
he
did
worry
much
about
it
either
except
at
budget
time
then
there
were
screams
of
anguish
from
the
front
office
over
experimental
requisitions
every
year
old
rock
jaw
promised
to
fire
us
all
if
we
did
cut
costs
but
in
a
couple
of
weeks
we
always
forgot
about
it
trouble
was
the
chief
had
been
getting
edgy
about
costs
lately
so
we
knew
it
was
about
time
for
the
annual
budget
battle
significantly
he
did
say
a
word
to
kenzie
about
the
gadget
as
luck
would
have
it
i
was
working
late
one
night
on
a
special
permit
my
bench
is
over
in
a
wing
of
the
lab
and
i
guess
the
chief
forgot
i
was
around
i
saw
a
very
pretty
scene
the
chief
had
built
up
a
habit
of
staying
late
so
he
could
stand
and
study
over
the
kenzie
gadget
he
never
touched
it
though
he
knew
enough
not
to
bother
anything
because
we
all
knew
how
bitter
kenzie
was
when
anybody
touched
his
things
the
chief
was
standing
there
this
evening
when
the
general
manager
old
rock
jaw
was
showing
some
important
personages
through
the
plant
after
hours
they
came
through
the
lab
door
and
i
saw
scrambled
eggs
and
fruit
salad
shining
all
over
bulging
uniforms
there
was
also
one
little
geezik
in
a
suit
old
rock
jaw
was
talking
as
usual
and
it
is
from
this
room
gentlemen
he
was
saying
that
some
of
those
revolutionary
discoveries
emanate
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
chief
who
had
hastily
picked
up
a
cold
soldering
iron
and
was
tentatively
touching
a
random
point
on
the
new
mechanism
old
rock
jaw
exclaimed
with
satisfaction
here
is
our
chief
scientist
now
still
at
work
he
watches
no
clock
gentlemen
he
knows
no
time
his
whole
life
is
wrapped
up
in
his
research
the
chief
did
look
around
but
bent
closer
to
the
soldering
point
he
looked
like
he
hoped
they
would
limit
their
inspection
to
a
cursory
look
about
and
then
retire
i
hoped
they
would
too
i
did
want
them
to
see
me
but
old
rock
jaw
in
more
of
a
blowhard
mood
even
than
usual
let
well
enough
alone
he
came
up
close
to
the
chief
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
mechanism
he
was
even
more
ignorant
than
the
chief
so
i
knew
he
would
recognize
any
of
it
do
let
us
disturb
you
alfred
he
breathed
in
a
hushed
voice
but
could
you
tell
the
gentlemen
what
you
are
working
on
now
he
cleared
his
throat
importantly
and
said
i
might
add
that
everyone
here
has
been
security
cleared
alfred
so
you
may
speak
freely
the
chief
still
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
his
work
he
did
dare
he
carefully
turned
an
unconnected
control
knob
a
hairsbreadth
with
utmost
deliberation
and
precision
multimicrofrequidometer
the
chief
mumbled
and
buried
his
head
still
deeper
into
the
mechanism
ah
yes
of
course
but
you
have
a
new
hook
up
the
general
manager
bluffed
i
hardly
recognized
it
at
first
startling
he
breathed
he
looked
around
triumphantly
at
the
impressed
brass
and
braid
he
looked
pointedly
at
the
suit
who
probably
controlled
congressional
purse
strings
apparently
he
is
at
a
point
where
he
can
not
divert
his
attention
to
us
gentlemen
he
breathed
in
a
hushed
voice
he
placed
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
began
to
backwards
toward
the
door
the
beef
trust
in
fancy
uniform
came
up
on
their
own
toesies
and
also
tiptoed
away
from
the
genius
scientist
by
now
the
genius
was
beginning
to
exude
large
drops
of
sweat
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
the
chief
dropped
the
cold
soldering
iron
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
took
hold
of
his
tongue
where
he
must
have
been
biting
into
it
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
fingers
with
his
handkerchief
both
the
chief
and
i
heard
the
party
walking
down
the
hall
and
into
another
wing
of
the
building
i
still
did
make
a
sound
it
would
never
do
for
the
chief
to
know
he
had
been
observed
after
a
suitable
time
the
chief
also
tiptoed
out
of
the
lab
and
he
was
mumbling
to
himself
as
i
have
never
seen
him
mumble
before
several
days
later
another
thing
appeared
on
kenzie
work
bench
this
time
it
was
a
large
rectangular
glass
aquarium
it
was
filled
with
moist
earth
now
here
was
something
new
in
electronics
we
shook
our
heads
one
of
the
techs
who
fancied
himself
a
psychologist
said
the
boys
were
suffering
from
retrogressive
dementia
they
had
gone
so
far
back
into
childhood
they
had
to
play
sand
box
the
chief
overheard
the
tech
and
spoke
up
plaintively
but
i
do
see
any
celluloid
spade
and
bucket
he
said
he
seemed
relieved
when
we
burst
out
laughing
his
relief
did
last
long
however
it
changed
to
more
worry
when
he
saw
the
boys
carefully
sprinkling
bread
and
meat
crumbs
over
the
surface
of
the
sand
then
on
top
of
that
they
dropped
moist
bits
of
cake
icing
when
pringle
brought
down
a
marigold
plant
all
covered
with
aphis
and
transplanted
it
in
a
corner
of
the
aquarium
the
chief
again
ran
into
his
office
and
began
to
hold
his
head
in
his
hands
more
days
passed
the
gadget
became
a
bristling
porcupine
of
test
clips
by
now
the
boys
had
forgotten
they
were
working
for
the
company
and
spent
practically
all
their
time
on
the
whoozits
the
chief
became
so
fascinated
in
a
kind
of
manner
that
he
did
not
mention
the
aquarium
to
kenzie
at
all
the
rest
of
us
also
kept
away
from
that
side
of
the
lab
ever
since
kenzie
had
started
on
the
gadget
he
had
no
time
for
us
or
helping
us
with
our
problems
if
we
spoke
to
him
he
snapped
back
at
us
until
i
guess
all
our
noses
were
out
of
joint
by
the
time
the
aquarium
appeared
we
were
ignoring
him
and
everything
he
did
in
a
few
more
weeks
the
aquarium
was
swarming
with
ants
it
was
easy
to
see
their
tunnels
running
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
will
say
this
for
the
boys
they
set
it
in
a
huge
pan
of
water
none
of
us
could
legitimately
squawk
about
getting
ants
mixed
up
with
our
anatomy
the
chief
showed
he
was
mixed
with
disappointment
and
elation
when
the
boys
asked
clearance
to
work
nights
in
the
lab
disappointed
since
he
could
no
longer
stay
late
and
follow
the
progress
elated
because
the
boys
must
really
be
getting
hot
annual
budget
time
was
getting
closer
and
we
could
see
the
wheels
going
around
in
his
mind
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
he
could
deliver
the
multiwhoozits
gadget
just
before
the
big
fight
for
appropriations
as
far
as
we
knew
the
only
interest
the
general
manager
had
shown
was
the
time
he
asked
the
chief
in
the
hall
how
that
multiwhoozits
was
coming
along
even
in
that
question
it
was
evident
old
rock
jaw
was
asking
out
of
a
rare
politeness
only
there
being
no
big
shots
around
to
impress
it
was
doubtful
if
the
heard
the
chief
vague
answer
because
the
old
boy
was
mumbling
to
himself
about
rising
costs
and
having
to
cut
down
expenses
he
waddled
on
down
the
hall
he
was
still
mumbling
as
he
went
but
both
the
chief
and
i
heard
one
sentence
clearly
and
certain
salaries
and
bonuses
will
have
to
be
cut
the
chief
turned
pale
so
he
granted
kenzie
request
with
alacrity
and
hoped
he
would
finish
the
gadget
in
time
for
two
more
weeks
the
chief
waited
patiently
or
maybe
impatiently
he
knew
the
boys
were
working
every
night
because
the
security
police
complained
about
their
pinochle
game
being
interrupted
to
let
kenzie
and
pringle
in
and
out
both
the
boys
began
to
get
a
feverish
look
in
their
faces
their
cheeks
grew
hollow
their
eyes
were
bloodshot
their
regular
work
suffered
even
more
the
chief
thought
he
was
being
considerate
when
he
lifted
some
of
their
work
and
shoved
it
over
to
the
rest
of
us
we
were
already
sore
at
the
boys
and
we
did
take
it
too
kindly
just
the
same
we
did
let
our
squawk
get
beyond
the
walls
of
the
lab
no
use
letting
that
nosy
personnel
department
get
an
excuse
to
start
holding
hands
patting
on
the
back
and
radiating
aid
and
comfort
to
all
then
a
certain
monday
came
the
chief
came
in
a
little
late
as
usual
some
of
the
newer
guys
pretended
to
be
busy
but
we
were
all
watching
to
see
what
he
would
do
there
is
a
back
door
to
the
chief
office
which
he
seldom
uses
and
which
he
always
keeps
locked
but
it
opens
into
the
lab
wing
right
at
my
table
it
was
my
fault
in
fiddling
around
a
little
with
the
lock
it
came
unstuck
and
the
door
opened
a
little
so
i
could
hear
what
went
on
when
the
chief
came
in
both
the
boys
were
busy
dismantling
the
gadget
discouragement
and
hopelessness
were
written
all
over
their
faces
in
the
dejected
slope
of
their
shoulders
in
the
lackadaisical
movements
of
their
arms
piece
by
piece
through
the
glass
partition
of
his
office
wall
the
chief
watched
the
gadget
being
taken
apart
each
piece
was
carefully
taken
back
and
placed
in
stock
for
that
alone
was
enough
to
create
great
alarm
for
their
sanity
imagine
a
technician
putting
a
piece
back
to
be
used
over
finally
the
chief
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
called
them
into
his
office
he
carefully
shut
the
door
but
he
did
notice
the
back
door
swung
open
a
little
farther
i
found
it
necessary
to
work
close
to
the
crack
and
if
i
turned
around
i
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
entire
office
the
chief
waved
the
boys
into
chairs
across
from
his
desk
he
sat
down
and
placed
his
fingertips
together
even
then
i
could
see
his
hands
were
shaking
he
leaned
forward
and
asked
with
careful
sympathy
in
his
voice
did
it
work
yeah
kenzie
answered
in
a
bored
voice
it
worked
i
was
surprised
at
kenzie
voice
usually
he
talked
with
the
concise
enunciation
of
a
professor
now
he
sounded
like
maybe
just
a
good
lab
tech
then
why
are
you
dismantling
it
the
chief
asked
with
a
worried
frown
it
would
be
good
for
people
to
know
about
it
pringle
burst
out
i
do
understand
the
chief
faltered
then
desperately
look
fellows
i
given
you
a
lotta
leeway
you
sluffed
your
work
something
terrible
that
all
right
to
an
extent
i
covered
for
you
thanks
chief
kenzie
said
drily
but
old
rock
er
the
general
manager
the
chief
complained
knows
i
been
working
on
something
now
what
with
budgets
coming
on
and
all
i
got
ta
have
something
to
show
been
working
on
something
pringle
exclaimed
i
mean
my
department
has
the
chief
covered
himself
hastily
responsible
for
what
goes
on
in
my
department
you
know
i
got
ta
have
some
kind
of
an
explanation
he
was
almost
wailing
now
what
with
budgets
coming
on
and
all
make
up
your
own
explanation
kenzie
answered
disinterestedly
it
a
cinch
you
ca
give
out
with
the
real
one
the
chief
began
to
wheedle
you
two
boys
know
the
explanation
why
ca
you
tell
me
this
is
your
chief
who
talking
boys
the
one
who
has
always
stood
by
you
and
covered
for
you
remember
you
just
got
ta
tell
me
boys
i
saw
pringle
and
kenzie
look
at
one
another
i
guess
he
right
ken
pringle
said
that
is
if
he
promises
never
to
tell
anybody
yeah
i
guess
so
kenzie
nodded
his
head
in
agreement
we
owe
him
that
much
for
just
letting
us
alone
the
chief
let
out
a
big
sigh
of
relief
it
about
ants
kenzie
began
now
now
kenzie
boy
the
chief
interrupted
hurriedly
let
stay
on
the
subject
shall
we
let
not
get
off
on
that
tangent
again
kenzie
boy
shall
we
nuts
kenzie
said
but
this
is
about
ants
chief
pringle
answered
then
shrewdly
but
first
you
got
ta
promise
chief
all
right
i
promise
the
chief
acceded
testily
it
about
ants
kenzie
repeated
stubbornly
the
chief
winced
but
he
held
his
peace
they
intelligent
kenzie
said
profoundly
and
stopped
i
know
the
chief
prompted
i
know
kenzie
boy
you
been
saying
that
all
along
i
communicated
with
them
kenzie
said
flatly
you
what
the
chief
eyes
bugged
out
i
guess
mine
did
too
sure
kenzie
answered
after
a
fashion
that
is
in
their
anthers
they
got
a
chitin
cell
diaphragm
modified
cellular
structure
they
communicate
with
a
sort
of
microwave
roughly
you
might
say
it
generates
and
radiates
like
our
brain
wave
roughly
very
roughly
this
chitin
diaphragm
picks
up
the
microwave
like
our
ears
pick
up
sound
roughly
that
is
but
that
wonderful
the
chief
glowed
it
did
take
much
imagination
to
see
him
in
the
general
manager
office
explaining
how
his
multiwhoozits
gadget
worked
maybe
nothing
immediately
commercial
about
it
but
when
the
publicity
office
got
hold
of
it
man
it
would
mean
plenty
of
free
publicity
for
the
company
and
how
old
rock
jaw
loved
free
publicity
we
tuned
in
on
them
kenzie
was
saying
by
putting
different
kinds
of
food
around
and
by
making
different
kinds
of
disturbances
we
worked
out
a
crude
sort
of
vocabulary
you
did
the
chief
exclaimed
nothing
fancy
you
understand
kenzie
belittled
his
achievement
but
enough
so
when
we
broadcast
a
sugar
wave
they
came
running
to
the
surface
to
see
where
it
was
when
we
broadcast
a
water
wave
they
rushed
to
the
ant
nursery
and
started
carrying
eggs
to
high
ground
glory
be
the
chief
breathed
in
his
eyes
there
was
the
vision
of
world
renowned
scientists
patting
him
on
the
back
maybe
even
more
important
old
rock
jaw
was
actually
smiling
and
telling
him
he
could
have
unlimited
funds
in
his
budget
sure
kenzie
said
bitterly
sure
that
was
all
very
fine
big
shots
we
were
going
to
be
pringle
and
me
first
time
in
history
man
had
talked
with
an
insect
maybe
even
get
our
pictures
in
the
paper
same
as
if
we
murdered
somebody
fame
yeah
pringle
chimed
in
first
step
in
learning
how
to
communicate
with
an
alien
mind
nuts
i
do
get
it
the
chief
stammered
what
wrong
with
that
well
we
went
on
perfecting
the
vocabulary
kenzie
said
you
know
fining
it
down
had
the
little
beggars
practically
standing
on
their
heads
at
times
with
our
wave
he
grinned
at
the
memory
and
seemed
to
shake
off
some
of
his
lethargy
you
shoulda
been
here
the
night
pringle
had
them
marching
in
formation
his
face
fell
again
we
kept
on
improving
the
gadget
he
said
with
hangdog
attitude
we
still
had
made
direct
communication
you
understand
nothing
like
do
you
do
ant
this
is
kenzie
mackenzie
human
talking
then
he
sneered
at
his
memory
with
our
microwave
we
could
make
them
do
things
but
hell
you
can
make
them
run
out
of
the
ground
by
pouring
water
down
their
hole
that
not
communication
we
could
seem
to
contact
them
direct
make
them
know
we
were
communicating
but
you
still
the
chief
said
he
had
visions
of
every
home
using
a
gadget
to
broadcast
keep
away
signals
to
ant
pests
our
gadget
was
still
crude
at
that
point
kenzie
interrupted
we
fined
it
down
more
and
more
that
when
we
began
to
pick
up
the
star
static
star
static
the
chief
faltered
he
would
know
about
that
pringle
said
and
i
could
detect
contempt
in
his
voice
even
if
the
chief
did
sure
he
would
kenzie
corrected
everybody
knows
about
the
fifty
or
so
stars
that
send
out
continuous
radio
signals
and
how
we
been
trying
for
years
to
unscramble
them
why
certainly
the
chief
said
so
positively
i
knew
he
had
heard
of
it
before
anyway
kenzie
said
the
more
we
worked
out
the
vocabulary
code
the
more
the
star
signals
began
to
fit
right
into
it
so
we
decided
to
break
up
the
thing
and
forget
all
about
ants
honest
chief
never
hear
me
mention
the
word
again
termites
either
pringle
chimed
in
but
i
still
do
understand
the
chief
complained
it
still
all
sounds
marvelous
i
just
do
understand
draw
him
a
picture
pringle
said
disgustedly
okay
kenzie
acceded
how
many
years
would
you
say
ants
have
been
on
earth
chief
oh
i
do
know
the
chief
answered
quite
a
few
i
say
yeah
kenzie
said
drily
quite
a
few
at
least
a
million
unchanged
a
perfect
life
form
with
a
perfect
civilization
so
perfect
nature
has
seen
any
need
to
change
them
for
a
million
years
so
what
the
chief
asked
they
nothing
we
come
along
and
make
them
do
nip
ups
yeah
kenzie
was
bitter
again
we
humans
go
around
talking
about
how
brave
and
smart
we
are
how
someday
we
might
even
get
so
smart
we
contact
other
intelligent
races
on
other
worlds
yeah
smart
you
know
those
star
radiations
that
not
my
specialty
you
know
the
chief
answered
cautiously
some
of
those
radiations
started
out
from
their
home
planet
a
million
years
ago
pringle
said
quietly
so
what
again
the
chief
asked
those
radiations
kenzie
said
happen
to
be
communications
between
the
galaxies
beamed
at
the
ants
sort
of
a
continuous
radio
program
broadcast
universe
wide
it
happens
the
ants
maybe
termites
maybe
other
insects
are
spread
through
all
the
galaxies
it
happens
are
the
dominant
intelligent
race
throughout
the
universe
he
shrugged
in
disgust
us
big
brave
humans
he
said
contemptuously
someday
we
might
even
reach
mars
hell
those
ants
have
been
colonizing
for
hundreds
of
millions
of
years
they
still
communicating
they
are
the
real
intelligence
on
the
earth
he
crushed
a
cigarette
fiercely
into
a
glass
ash
tray
on
the
desk
only
thing
man
has
got
or
ever
had
was
his
ego
he
got
to
believe
he
top
dog
or
else
he
folds
and
quits
yeah
we
smart
all
right
hell
we
so
far
down
the
scale
the
ants
do
even
recognize
us
as
a
life
form
at
all
pringle
nodded
soberly
yeah
he
said
to
the
chief
how
would
you
like
to
explain
a
gadget
that
proved
ants
have
more
brains
than
you
have
the
chief
looked
at
them
with
incredulous
eyes
he
was
still
staring
at
them
silently
with
a
bloodless
face
when
the
office
messenger
came
in
and
told
him
the
general
manager
wished
to
see
him
in
his
office
to
discuss
budgets
i
closed
the
back
office
door
quietly
and
went
back
to
work
the
other
guys
clustered
around
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
heard
nothing
i
said
and
looked
them
straight
in
the
eye
nothing
at
all
the
end
