hunger
by
knut
hamsun
translated
from
the
norwegian
by
george
egerton
an
introduction
by
edwin
knut
hamsun
since
the
death
of
ibsen
and
strindberg
hamsun
is
undoubtedly
the
foremost
creative
writer
of
the
scandinavian
countries
those
approaching
most
nearly
to
his
position
are
probably
selma
lagerlöf
in
sweden
and
henrik
pontoppidan
in
denmark
both
these
however
seem
to
have
less
than
he
of
that
width
of
outlook
validity
of
interpretation
and
authority
of
tone
that
made
the
greater
masters
what
they
were
his
reputation
is
not
confined
to
his
own
country
or
the
two
scandinavian
sister
nations
it
spread
long
ago
over
the
rest
of
europe
taking
deepest
roots
in
russia
where
several
editions
of
his
collected
works
have
already
appeared
and
where
he
is
spoken
of
as
the
equal
of
tolstoy
and
dostoyevski
the
enthusiasm
of
this
approval
is
a
characteristic
symptom
that
throws
interesting
light
on
russia
as
well
as
on
hamsun
hearing
of
it
one
might
expect
him
to
prove
a
man
of
the
masses
full
of
keen
social
consciousness
instead
he
must
be
classed
as
an
individualistic
romanticist
and
a
highly
subjective
aristocrat
whose
foremost
passion
in
life
is
violent
defiant
deviation
from
everything
average
and
ordinary
he
fears
and
flouts
the
dominance
of
the
many
and
his
heroes
who
are
nothing
but
slightly
varied
images
of
himself
are
invariably
marked
by
an
originality
of
speech
and
action
that
brings
them
close
to
if
not
across
the
borderline
of
the
eccentric
in
all
the
literature
known
to
me
there
is
no
writer
who
appears
more
ruthlessly
and
fearlessly
himself
and
the
self
thus
presented
to
us
is
as
paradoxical
and
rebellious
as
it
is
poetic
and
picturesque
such
a
nature
one
would
think
must
be
the
final
blossoming
of
powerful
hereditary
tendencies
converging
silently
through
numerous
generations
to
its
predestined
climax
all
we
know
is
that
hamsun
forebears
were
sturdy
norwegian
peasant
folk
said
only
to
be
differentiated
from
their
neighbours
by
certain
artistic
preoccupations
that
turned
one
or
two
of
them
into
skilled
craftsmen
more
certain
it
is
that
what
may
or
may
not
have
been
innate
was
favoured
and
fostered
and
exaggerated
by
physical
environment
and
early
social
experiences
hamsun
was
born
on
in
one
of
the
sunny
valleys
of
central
norway
from
there
his
parents
moved
when
he
was
only
four
to
settle
in
the
far
northern
district
of
lofoden
that
land
of
extremes
where
the
year
and
not
the
day
is
evenly
divided
between
darkness
and
light
where
winter
is
a
long
dreamless
sleep
and
summer
a
passionate
dream
without
sleep
where
land
and
sea
meet
and
intermingle
so
gigantically
that
man
is
all
but
crushed
between
the
two
or
else
raised
to
titanic
measures
by
the
spectacle
of
their
struggle
the
northland
with
its
glaring
lights
and
black
shadows
its
unearthly
joys
and
abysmal
despairs
is
present
and
dominant
in
every
line
that
hamsun
ever
wrote
in
that
country
his
best
tales
and
dramas
are
laid
by
that
country
his
heroes
are
stamped
wherever
they
roam
out
of
that
country
they
draw
their
principal
claims
to
probability
only
in
that
country
do
they
seem
quite
at
home
today
we
know
however
that
the
pathological
case
represents
nothing
but
an
extension
of
perfectly
normal
tendencies
in
the
same
way
we
know
that
the
miraculous
atmosphere
of
the
northland
serves
merely
to
develop
and
emphasize
traits
that
lie
slumbering
in
men
and
women
everywhere
and
on
this
basis
the
fantastic
figures
created
by
hamsun
relate
themselves
to
ordinary
humanity
as
the
microscopic
enlargement
of
a
cross
section
to
the
living
tissues
what
we
see
is
true
in
everything
but
proportion
the
artist
and
the
vagabond
seem
equally
to
have
been
in
the
blood
of
hamsun
from
the
very
start
apprenticed
to
a
shoemaker
he
used
his
scant
savings
to
arrange
for
the
private
printing
of
a
long
poem
and
a
short
novel
produced
at
the
age
of
eighteen
when
he
was
still
signing
himself
knud
pedersen
hamsund
this
done
he
abruptly
quit
his
apprenticeship
and
entered
on
that
period
of
restless
roving
through
trades
and
continents
which
lasted
until
his
first
real
artistic
achievement
with
hunger
in
it
has
often
been
noted
that
practically
every
one
of
hamsun
heroes
is
of
the
same
age
as
he
was
then
and
that
their
creator
takes
particular
pain
to
accentuate
this
fact
it
is
almost
as
if
during
those
days
of
feverish
literary
struggle
he
had
risen
to
heights
where
he
saw
things
so
clearly
that
no
subsequent
experience
could
add
anything
but
occasional
details
before
he
reached
those
heights
he
had
tried
life
as
and
school
teacher
as
and
surveyor
attendant
as
farm
hand
and
streetcar
conductor
as
lecturer
and
journalist
as
tourist
and
emigrant
twice
he
visited
this
country
during
the
middle
eighties
working
chiefly
on
the
plains
of
north
dakota
and
in
the
streets
of
chicago
twice
during
that
time
he
returned
to
his
own
country
and
passed
through
the
experiences
pictured
in
hunger
before
at
last
he
found
his
own
literary
self
and
thus
also
a
hearing
from
the
world
at
large
while
here
he
failed
utterly
to
establish
any
sympathetic
contact
between
himself
and
the
new
world
and
his
first
book
after
his
return
in
was
a
volume
of
studies
named
the
spiritual
life
of
modern
america
which
a
prominent
norwegian
critic
once
described
as
a
masterpiece
of
distorted
criticism
but
i
own
a
copy
of
this
book
the
of
which
bears
the
following
inscription
in
the
author
autograph
a
youthful
work
it
has
ceased
to
represent
my
opinion
of
america
may
knut
hamsun
in
its
original
form
hunger
was
merely
a
sketch
and
as
such
it
appeared
in
in
a
danish
literary
periodical
new
earth
it
attracted
immediate
widespread
attention
to
the
author
both
on
account
of
its
unusual
theme
and
striking
form
it
was
a
new
kind
of
realism
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
photographic
reproduction
of
details
it
was
a
professedly
psychological
study
that
had
about
as
much
in
common
with
the
conceptions
of
man
mental
activities
as
the
delirious
utterances
of
a
fever
patient
it
was
life
but
presented
in
the
impressionistic
temper
of
a
gauguin
or
cezanne
on
the
appearance
of
the
completed
novel
in
hamsun
was
greeted
as
one
of
the
chief
heralds
of
the
movement
then
spreading
rapidly
through
the
scandinavian
north
and
finding
typical
expressions
not
only
in
the
works
of
theretofore
unknown
writers
but
in
the
changed
moods
of
masters
like
ibsen
and
bjornson
and
strindberg
it
was
followed
two
years
later
by
mysteries
which
pretends
to
be
a
novel
but
which
may
be
better
described
as
a
delightfully
irresponsible
and
defiantly
subjective
roaming
through
any
highway
or
byway
of
life
or
letters
that
happened
to
take
the
author
fancy
at
the
moment
of
writing
some
one
has
said
of
that
book
that
in
its
abrupt
swingings
from
laughter
to
tears
from
irreverence
to
awe
from
the
ridiculous
to
the
sublime
one
finds
the
spirits
of
dostoyevski
and
mark
twain
blended
the
novels
editor
lynge
and
new
earth
both
published
in
were
social
studies
of
christiania
bohemia
and
chiefly
characterized
by
their
violent
attacks
on
the
men
and
women
exercising
the
profession
which
hamsun
had
just
made
his
own
then
came
pan
in
and
the
real
hamsun
the
hamsun
who
ever
since
has
moved
logically
and
with
increasing
authority
to
the
growth
of
the
soil
stood
finally
revealed
it
is
a
novel
of
the
northland
almost
without
a
plot
and
having
its
chief
interest
in
a
primitively
spontaneous
man
reactions
to
a
nature
so
overwhelming
that
it
makes
mere
purposeless
existence
seem
a
sufficient
end
in
itself
one
may
well
question
whether
hamsun
has
ever
surpassed
the
purely
lyrical
mood
of
that
book
into
which
he
poured
the
ecstatic
dreams
of
the
little
boy
from
the
south
as
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
forestclad
northern
mountains
bathing
their
feet
in
the
ocean
and
their
crowns
in
the
light
of
a
sun
it
is
a
wonderful
paean
to
untamed
nature
and
to
the
forces
let
loose
by
it
within
the
soul
of
man
like
most
of
the
great
writers
over
there
hamsun
has
not
confined
himself
to
one
poetic
mood
or
form
but
has
tried
all
of
them
from
the
line
of
novels
culminating
in
pan
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
drama
and
in
appeared
his
first
play
at
the
gates
of
the
kingdom
it
was
the
opening
drama
of
a
trilogy
and
was
followed
by
the
game
of
life
in
and
sunset
glow
in
the
first
play
is
laid
in
christiania
the
second
in
the
northland
and
the
third
in
christiania
again
the
hero
of
all
three
is
ivar
kareno
a
student
and
thinker
who
is
first
presented
to
us
at
the
age
of
then
at
and
finally
at
his
wife
and
several
other
characters
accompany
the
central
figure
through
the
trilogy
of
which
the
lesson
seems
to
be
that
every
one
is
a
rebel
at
and
a
renegade
at
but
when
kareno
the
irreconcilable
rebel
of
at
the
gates
of
the
kingdom
the
of
the
game
of
life
and
the
acclaimed
radical
leader
in
the
first
acts
of
sunset
glow
surrenders
at
last
to
the
powers
that
be
in
order
to
gain
a
safe
and
sheltered
harbor
for
his
declining
years
then
another
man
of
stands
ready
to
denounce
him
and
to
take
up
the
rebel
cry
of
youth
to
which
he
has
become
a
traitor
hamsun
ironical
humor
and
whimsical
manner
of
expression
do
more
than
the
plot
itself
to
knit
the
plays
into
an
organic
unit
and
several
of
the
characters
are
delightfully
drawn
particularly
the
two
women
who
play
the
greatest
part
in
kareno
life
his
wife
eline
and
teresita
who
is
one
more
of
his
many
feminine
embodiments
of
the
passionate
and
changeable
northland
nature
any
attempt
to
give
a
political
tendency
to
the
trilogy
must
be
held
wasted
characteristically
kareno
is
a
sort
of
nietzschean
rebel
against
the
victorious
majority
and
seemingly
cynical
conclusions
stress
man
capacity
for
action
rather
than
the
purposes
toward
which
that
capacity
may
be
directed
of
three
subsequent
plays
vendt
the
monk
queen
tamara
and
at
the
mercy
of
life
the
first
mentioned
is
by
far
the
most
remarkable
it
is
a
verse
drama
in
eight
acts
centred
about
one
of
hamsun
most
typical
vagabond
heroes
the
monk
vendt
has
much
in
common
with
peer
gynt
without
being
in
any
way
an
imitation
or
a
duplicate
he
is
a
dreamer
in
revolt
against
the
world
alleged
injustice
a
rebel
against
the
very
powers
that
invisibly
move
the
universe
and
a
passionate
lover
of
life
who
in
the
end
accepts
it
as
a
joyful
battle
and
then
dreams
of
the
long
peace
to
come
the
vigor
and
charm
of
the
verse
proved
a
surprise
to
the
critics
when
the
play
was
published
as
hamsun
until
then
had
given
no
proof
of
any
poetic
gift
in
the
narrower
sense
from
to
hamsun
produced
a
series
of
volumes
that
simply
marked
a
further
development
of
the
tendencies
shown
in
his
first
novels
siesta
short
stories
victoria
a
novel
with
a
charming
love

that
embodies
the
tenderest
note
in
his
production
in

from
the
caucasus

and

two
novels
forming
to
some
extent
sequels
to
pan
a
wanderer
plays
with
muted
strings
a
novel
and
the
last
joy
a
shapeless
work
half
novel
and
half
mere
uncoordinated
reflections
the
later
part
of
this
output
seemed
to
indicate
a
lack
of
development
a
failure
to
open
up
new
vistas
that
caused
many
to
fear
that
the
principal
contributions
of
hamsun
already
lay
behind
him
then
appeared
in
a
big
novel
children
of
the
time
which
in
many
ways
struck
a
new
note
although
led
up
to
by
rosa
and
benoni
the
horizon
is
now
wider
the
picture
broader
there
is
still
a
central
figure
and
still
he
possesses
many
of
the
old
hamsun
traits
but
he
has
crossed
the
meridian
at
last
and
become
an
observer
rather
than
a
fighter
and
doer
nor
is
he
the
central
figure
to
the
same
extent
as
lieutenant
glahn
in
pan
or
kareno
in
the
trilogy
the
life
pictured
is
the
life
of
a
certain
spot
of
ground
segelfoss
manor
and
later
the
town
of
segelfoss
rather
than
that
of
one
or
two
isolated
individuals
one
might
almost
say
that
hamsun
vision
has
become
social
at
last
were
it
not
for
his
continued
accentuation
of
the
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
individual
and
the
group
segelfoss
town
in
and
the
growth
of
the
soil
the
title
ought
to
be
the
earth
increase
in
continue
along
the
path
hamsun
entered
by
children
of
the
time
the
scene
is
laid
in
his
beloved
northland
but
the
old
primitive
life
is
going
going
even
in
the
outlying
districts
where
the
pioneers
are
already
breaking
ground
for
new
permanent
settlements
business
of
a
modern
type
has
arrived
and
much
of
the
quiet
humor
displayed
in
these
the
latest
and
maturest
of
hamsun
works
springs
from
the
spectacle
of
its
influence
on
the
natives
whose
hands
used
always
to
be
in
their
pockets
and
whose
credulity
in
face
of
the
improbable
was
only
surpassed
by
their
unwillingness
to
believe
anything
reasonable
still
the
life
he
pictures
is
largely
primitive
with
nature
as
man
chief
antagonist
and
to
us
of
the
crowded
cities
it
brings
a
charm
of
novelty
rarely
found
in
books
today
with
it
goes
an
understanding
of
human
nature
which
is
no
less
because
it
is
apt
to
find
expression
in
whimsical
or
flagrantly
paradoxical
forms
hamsun
has
just
celebrated
his
sixtieth
birthday
anniversary
he
is
as
strong
and
active
as
ever
burying
himself
most
of
the
time
on
his
little
estate
in
the
heart
of
the
country
that
has
become
to
such
a
peculiar
extent
his
own
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
from
him
works
that
may
not
only
equal
but
surpass
the
best
of
his
production
so
far
but
even
if
such
expectations
should
prove
false
the
body
of
his
work
already
accomplished
is
such
both
in
quantity
and
quality
that
he
must
perforce
be
placed
in
the
very
front
rank
of
the
world
living
writers
to
the
world
he
has
so
far
been
made
known
only
through
the
casual
publication
at
long
intervals
of
a
few
of
his
books
hunger
fictoria
and
shallow
soil
rendered
in
the
list
above
as
new
earth
there
is
now
reason
to
believe
that
this
negligence
will
be
remedied
and
that
soon
the
best
of
hamsun
work
will
be
available
in
english
to
the
american
and
english
publics
it
ought
to
prove
a
welcome
tonic
because
of
its
very
divergence
from
what
they
commonly
feed
on
and
they
may
safely
look
to
hamsun
as
a
thinker
as
well
as
a
poet
and
laughing
dreamer
provided
they
realize
from
the
start
that
his
thinking
is
suggestive
rather
than
conclusive
and
that
he
never
meant
it
to
be
anything
else

had
begun
to
go
up

down

was

been
somewhat
lately
and
one
after
the
other
of
my
belongings
had
been
taken
to
my
uncle
i
had
grown
nervous
and
irritable
a
few
times
i
had
kept
my
bed
for
the
day
with
vertigo
now
and
then
when
luck
had
favoured
me
i
had
managed
to
get
five
shillings
for
a
feuilleton
from
some
newspaper
or
other
it
grew
lighter
and
lighter
and
i
took
to
reading
the
advertisements
near
the
door
i
could
even
make
out
the
grinning
lean
letters
of
to
be
had
at
miss
andersen
on
the
right
of
it
that
occupied
me
for
a
long
while
i
heard
the
clock
below
strike
eight
as
i
got
up
and
put
on
my
clothes
i
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
from
where
i
was
standing
i
had
a
view
of
a
and
an
open
field
farther
away
lay
the
ruins
of
a
smithy
which
some
labourers
were
busy
clearing
away
i
leant
with
my
elbows
resting
on
the
and
gazed
into
open
space
it
promised
to
be
a
clear
day
autumn
that
tender
cool
time
of
the
year
when
all
things
change
their
colour
and
die
had
come
to
us
the
noise
in
the
streets
lured
me
out
the
bare
room
the
floor
of
which
rocked
up
and
down
with
every
step
i
took
across
it
seemed
like
a
gasping
sinister
coffin
there
was
no
proper
fastening
to
the
door
either
and
no
stove
i
used
to
lie
on
my
socks
at
night
to
dry
them
a
little
by
the
morning
the
only
thing
i
had
to
divert
myself
with
was
a
little
red
in
which
i
used
to
sit
in
the
evenings
and
doze
and
muse
on
all
manner
of
things
when
it
blew
hard
and
the
door
below
stood
open
all
kinds
of
eerie
sounds
moaned
up
through
the
floor
and
from
out
the
walls
and
the
near
the
door
was
rent
in
strips
a
span
long
i
stood
up
and
searched
through
a
bundle
in
the
corner
by
the
bed
for
a
bite
for
breakfast
but
finding
nothing
went
back
to
the
window
god
knows
thought
i
if
looking
for
employment
will
ever
again
avail
me
aught
the
frequent
repulses
and
curt
noes
the
cherished
deluded
hopes
and
fresh
endeavours
that
always
resulted
in
nothing
had
done
my
courage
to
death
as
a
last
resource
i
had
applied
for
a
place
as
debt
collector
but
i
was
too
late
and
besides
i
could
not
have
found
the
fifty
shillings
demanded
as
security
there
was
always
something
or
another
in
my
way
i
had
even
offered
to
enlist
in
the
fire
brigade
there
we
stood
and
waited
in
the
vestibule
some
men
thrusting
our
chests
out
to
give
an
idea
of
strength
and
bravery
whilst
an
inspector
walked
up
and
down
and
scanned
the
applicants
felt
their
arms
and
put
one
question
or
another
to
them
me
he
passed
by
merely
shaking
his
head
saying
i
was
rejected
on
account
of
my
sight
i
applied
again
without
my
glasses
stood
there
with
knitted
brows
and
made
my
eyes
as
sharp
as
needles
but
the
man
passed
me
by
again
with
a
smile
he
had
recognized
me
and
worse
than
all
i
could
no
longer
apply
for
a
situation
in
the
garb
of
a
respectable
man
how
regularly
and
steadily
things
had
gone
downhill
with
me
for
a
long
time
till
in
the
end
i
was
so
curiously
bared
of
every
conceivable
thing
i
had
not
even
a
comb
left
not
even
a
book
to
read
when
things
grew
all
too
sad
with
me
all
through
the
summer
up
in
the
churchyards
or
parks
where
i
used
to
sit
and
write
my
articles
for
the
newspapers
i
had
thought
out
column
after
column
on
the
most
miscellaneous
subjects
strange
ideas
quaint
fancies
conceits
of
my
restless
brain
in
despair
i
had
often
chosen
the
most
remote
themes
that
cost
me
long
hours
of
intense
effort
and
never
were
accepted
when
one
piece
was
finished
i
set
to
work
at
another
i
was
not
often
discouraged
by
the
editors
no
i
used
to
tell
myself
constantly
that
some
day
i
was
bound
to
succeed
and
really
occasionally
when
i
was
in
luck
way
and
made
a
hit
with
something
i
could
get
five
shillings
for
an
afternoon
work
once
again
i
raised
myself
from
the
window
went
over
to
the
and
sprinkled
some
water
on
the
shiny
knees
of
my
trousers
to
dull
them
a
little
and
make
them
look
a
trifle
newer
having
done
this
i
pocketed
paper
and
pencil
as
usual
and
went
out
i
stole
very
quietly
down
the
stairs
in
order
not
to
attract
my
landlady
attention
a
few
days
had
elapsed
since
my
rent
had
fallen
due
and
i
had
no
longer
anything
wherewith
to
raise
it
it
was
nine
the
roll
of
vehicles
and
hum
of
voices
filled
the
air
a
mighty
mingled
with
the
footsteps
of
the
pedestrians
and
the
crack
of
the
whips
the
clamorous
traffic
everywhere
exhilarated
me
at
once
and
i
began
to
feel
more
and
more
contented
nothing
was
farther
from
my
intention
than
to
merely
take
a
morning
walk
in
the
open
air
what
had
the
air
to
do
with
my
lungs
i
was
strong
as
a
giant
could
stop
a
dray
with
my
shoulders
a
sweet
unwonted
mood
a
feeling
of
lightsome
took
possession
of
me
i
fell
to
observing
the
people
i
met
and
who
passed
me
to
reading
the
placards
on
the
wall
noted
even
the
impression
of
a
glance
thrown
at
me
from
a
passing
let
each
bagatelle
each
trifling
incident
that
crossed
or
vanished
from
my
path
impress
me
if
one
only
had
just
a
little
to
eat
on
such
a
lightsome
day
the
sense
of
the
glad
morning
overwhelmed
me
my
satisfaction
became
and
for
no
definite
reason
i
began
to
hum
joyfully
at
a
butcher
stall
a
woman
stood
speculating
on
sausage
for
dinner
as
i
passed
her
she
looked
up
at
me
she
had
but
one
tooth
in
the
front
of
her
head
i
had
become
so
nervous
and
easily
affected
in
the
last
few
days
that
the
woman
face
made
a
loathsome
impression
upon
me
the
long
yellow
snag
looked
like
a
little
finger
pointing
out
of
her
gum
and
her
gaze
was
still
full
of
sausage
as
she
turned
it
upon
me
i
immediately
lost
all
appetite
and
a
feeling
of
nausea
came
over
me
when
i
reached
the
i
went
to
the
fountain
and
drank
a
little
i
looked
up
the
dial
marked
ten
on
our
saviour
tower
i
went
on
through
the
streets
listlessly
without
troubling
myself
about
anything
at
all
stopped
aimlessly
at
a
corner
turned
off
into
a
side
street
without
having
any
errand
there
i
simply
let
myself
go
wandered
about
in
the
pleasant
morning
swinging
myself
to
and
fro
amongst
other
happy
human
beings
this
air
was
clear
and
bright
and
my
mind
too
was
without
a
shadow
for
quite
ten
minutes
i
had
had
an
old
lame
man
ahead
of
me
he
carried
a
bundle
in
one
hand
and
exerted
his
whole
body
using
all
his
strength
in
his
endeavours
to
get
along
speedily
i
could
hear
how
he
panted
from
the
exertion
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
offer
to
bear
his
bundle
for
him
but
yet
i
made
no
effort
to
overtake
him
up
in
graendsen
i
met
hans
pauli
who
nodded
and
hurried
past
me
why
was
he
in
such
a
hurry
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
asking
him
for
a
shilling
and
more
than
that
i
intended
at
the
very
first
opportunity
to
return
him
a
blanket
which
i
had
borrowed
from
him
some
weeks
before
just
wait
until
i
could
get
my
foot
on
the
ladder
i
would
be
beholden
to
no
man
not
even
for
a
blanket
perhaps
even
this
very
day
i
might
commence
an
article
on
the
crimes
of
futurity
freedom
of
will
or
what
not
at
any
rate
something
worth
reading
something
for
which
i
would
at
least
get
ten
shillings
and
at
the
thought
of
this
article
i
felt
myself
fired
with
a
desire
to
set
to
work
immediately
and
to
draw
from
the
contents
of
my
overflowing
brain
i
would
find
a
suitable
place
to
write
in
the
park
and
not
rest
until
i
had
completed
my
article
but
the
old
cripple
was
still
making
the
same
sprawling
movements
ahead
of
me
up
the
street
the
sight
of
this
infirm
creature
constantly
in
front
of
me
commenced
to
irritate
me
his
journey
seemed
endless
perhaps
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
exactly
the
same
place
as
i
had
and
i
must
needs
have
him
before
my
eyes
the
whole
way
in
my
irritation
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
at
every
cross
street
as
if
waiting
to
see
which
direction
i
intended
to
take
upon
which
he
would
again
swing
his
bundle
in
the
air
and
peg
away
with
all
his
might
to
keep
ahead
of
me
i
follow
and
watch
this
tiresome
creature
and
get
more
and
more
exasperated
with
him
i
am
conscious
that
he
has
little
by
little
destroyed
my
happy
mood
and
dragged
the
pure
beautiful
morning
down
to
the
level
of
his
own
ugliness
he
looks
like
a
great
sprawling
reptile
striving
with
might
and
main
to
win
a
place
in
the
world
and
reserve
the
footpath
for
himself
when
we
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
i
determined
to
put
up
with
it
no
longer
i
turned
to
a
shop
window
and
stopped
in
order
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
getting
ahead
but
when
after
a
lapse
of
some
minutes
i
again
walked
on
there
was
the
man
still
in
front
of
me
he
too
had
stood
stock
still
without
stopping
to
reflect
i
made
three
or
four
furious
onward
strides
caught
him
up
and
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
stopped
directly
and
we
both
stared
at
one
another
fixedly
a
halfpenny
for
milk
he
whined
twisting
his
head
askew
so
that
was
how
the
wind
blew
i
felt
in
my
pockets
and
said
for
milk
eh
money
scarce
these
times
and
i
do
really
know
how
much
you
are
in
need
of
it
i
have
eaten
a
morsel
since
yesterday
in
drammen
i
have
got
a
farthing
nor
have
i
got
any
work
yet
are
you
an
artisan
yes
a
binder
a
what
a
for
that
matter
i
can
make
shoes
too
ah
that
alters
the
case
said
i
you
wait
here
for
some
minutes
and
i
shall
go
and
get
a
little
money
for
you
just
a
few
pence
i
hurried
as
fast
as
i
could
down
pyle
street
where
i
knew
of
a
pawnbroker
on
a
one
besides
to
whom
i
had
never
been
before
when
i
got
inside
the
hall
i
hastily
took
off
my
waistcoat
rolled
it
up
and
put
it
under
my
arm
after
which
i
went
upstairs
and
knocked
at
the
office
door
i
bowed
on
entering
and
threw
the
waistcoat
on
the
counter
said
the
man
yes
yes
thanks
i
replied
if
it
were
that
it
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
tight
for
me
of
course
i
would
part
with
it
i
got
the
money
and
the
ticket
and
went
back
considering
all
things
pawning
that
waistcoat
was
a
capital
notion
i
would
have
money
enough
over
for
a
plentiful
breakfast
and
before
evening
my
thesis
on
the
crimes
of
futurity
would
be
ready
i
began
to
find
existence
more
alluring
and
i
hurried
back
to
the
man
to
get
rid
of
him
there
it
is
said
i
i
am
glad
you
applied
to
me
first
the
man
took
the
money
and
scrutinized
me
closely
at
what
was
he
standing
there
staring
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
particularly
examined
the
knees
of
my
trousers
and
his
shameless
effrontery
bored
me
did
the
scoundrel
imagine
that
i
really
was
as
poor
as
i
looked
had
i
not
as
good
as
begun
to
write
an
article
for
besides
i
had
no
fear
whatever
for
the
future
i
had
many
irons
in
the
fire
what
on
earth
business
was
it
of
an
utter
stranger
if
i
chose
to
stand
him
a
drink
on
such
a
lovely
day
the
man
look
annoyed
me
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
give
him
a
good
before
i
left
him
i
threw
back
my
shoulders
and
said
my
good
fellow
you
have
adopted
a
most
unpleasant
habit
of
staring
at
a
man
knees
when
he
gives
you
a
shilling
he
leant
his
head
back
against
the
wall
and
opened
his
mouth
widely
something
was
working
in
that
empty
pate
of
his
and
he
evidently
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
meant
to
best
him
in
some
way
for
he
handed
me
back
the
money
i
stamped
on
the
pavement
and
swearing
at
him
told
him
to
keep
it
did
he
imagine
i
was
going
to
all
that
trouble
for
nothing
if
all
came
to
all
perhaps
i
owed
him
this
shilling
i
had
just
recollected
an
old
debt
he
was
standing
before
an
honest
man
honourable
to
his
in
short
the
money
was
his
oh
no
thanks
were
needed
it
had
been
a
pleasure
to
me
i
went
on
at
last
i
was
freed
from
this
plague
and
i
could
go
my
way
in
peace
i
turned
down
pyle
street
again
and
stopped
before
a
grocer
shop
the
whole
window
was
filled
with
eatables
and
i
decided
to
go
in
and
get
something
to
take
with
me
a
piece
of
cheese
and
a
french
roll
i
said
and
threw
my
sixpence
on
to
the
counter
bread
and
cheese
for
the
whole
of
it
asked
the
woman
ironically
without
looking
up
at
me
for
the
whole
sixpence
yes
i
answered
unruffled
i
took
them
up
bade
the
fat
old
woman
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
sped
full
tilt
up
castle
hill
to
the
park
i
found
a
bench
to
myself
and
began
to
bite
greedily
into
my
provender
it
did
me
good
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
had
such
a
square
meal
and
by
degrees
i
felt
the
same
sated
quiet
steal
over
me
that
one
feels
after
a
good
long
cry
my
courage
rose
mightily
i
could
no
longer
be
satisfied
with
writing
an
article
about
anything
so
simple
and
as
the
crimes
of
futurity
that
any
ass
might
arrive
at
ay
simply
deduct
from
history
i
felt
capable
of
a
much
greater
effort
than
that
i
was
in
a
fitting
mood
to
overcome
difficulties
and
i
decided
on
a
treatise
in
three
sections
on
philosophical
cognition
this
would
naturally
give
me
an
opportunity
of
crushing
pitiably
some
of
kant
sophistries
but
on
taking
out
my
writing
materials
to
commence
work
i
discovered
that
i
no
longer
owned
a
pencil
i
had
forgotten
it
in
the
my
pencil
was
lying
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
good
lord
how
everything
seems
to
take
a
delight
in
thwarting
me
today
i
swore
a
few
times
rose
from
the
seat
and
took
a
couple
of
turns
up
and
down
the
path
it
was
very
quiet
all
around
me
down
near
the
queen
arbour
two
nursemaids
were
trundling
their
perambulators
otherwise
there
was
not
a
creature
anywhere
in
sight
i
was
in
a
thoroughly
embittered
temper
i
paced
up
and
down
before
my
seat
like
a
maniac
how
strangely
awry
things
seemed
to
go
to
think
that
an
article
in
three
sections
should
be
downright
stranded
by
the
simple
fact
of
my
not
having
a
pennyworth
of
pencil
in
my
pocket
supposing
i
were
to
return
to
pyle
street
and
ask
to
get
my
pencil
back
there
would
be
still
time
to
get
a
good
piece
finished
before
the
promenading
public
commenced
to
fill
the
parks
so
much
too
depended
on
this
treatise
on
philosophical
cognition
mayhap
many
human
welfare
no
one
could
say
and
i
told
myself
it
might
be
of
the
greatest
possible
help
to
many
young
people
on
second
thoughts
i
would
not
lay
violent
hands
on
kant
i
might
easily
avoid
doing
that
i
would
only
need
to
make
an
almost
imperceptible
gliding
over
when
i
came
to
query
time
and
space
but
i
would
not
answer
for
renan
old
parson
renan
at
all
events
an
article
of
many
columns
has
to
be
completed
for
the
unpaid
rent
and
the
landlady
inquiring
look
in
the
morning
when
i
met
her
on
the
stairs
tormented
me
the
whole
day
it
rose
up
and
confronted
me
again
and
again
even
in
my
pleasant
hours
when
i
had
otherwise
not
a
gloomy
thought
i
must
put
an
end
to
it
so
i
left
the
park
hurriedly
to
fetch
my
pencil
from
the
pawnbroker
as
i
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
overtook
two
ladies
whom
i
passed
as
i
did
so
i
brushed
one
of
them
accidentally
on
the
arm
i
looked
up
she
had
a
full
rather
pale
face
but
she
blushes
and
becomes
suddenly
surprisingly
lovely
i
know
not
why
she
blushes
maybe
at
some
word
she
hears
from
a
maybe
only
at
some
lurking
thought
of
her
own
or
can
it
be
because
i
touched
her
arm
her
high
full
bosom
heaves
violently
several
times
and
she
closes
her
hand
tightly
above
the
handle
of
her
parasol
what
has
come
to
her
i
stopped
and
let
her
pass
ahead
again
i
could
for
the
moment
go
no
further
the
whole
thing
struck
me
as
being
so
singular
i
was
in
a
tantalizing
mood
annoyed
with
myself
on
account
of
the
pencil
incident
and
in
a
high
degree
disturbed
by
all
the
food
i
had
taken
on
a
totally
empty
stomach
suddenly
my
thoughts
as
if
whimsically
inspired
take
a
singular
direction
i
feel
myself
seized
with
an
odd
desire
to
make
this
lady
afraid
to
follow
her
and
annoy
her
in
some
way
i
overtake
her
again
pass
her
by
turn
quickly
round
and
meet
her
in
order
to
observe
her
well
i
stand
and
gaze
into
her
eyes
and
hit
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
on
a
name
which
i
have
never
heard
before
a
name
with
a
gliding
nervous
sound
ylajali
when
she
is
quite
close
to
me
i
draw
myself
up
and
say
impressively
you
are
losing
your
book
madam
i
could
hear
my
heart
beat
audibly
as
i
said
it
my
book
she
asks
her
companion
and
she
walks
on
my
devilment
waxed
apace
and
i
followed
them
at
the
same
time
i
was
fully
conscious
that
i
was
playing
a
mad
prank
without
being
able
to
stop
myself
my
disordered
condition
ran
away
with
me
i
was
inspired
with
the
craziest
notions
which
i
followed
blindly
as
they
came
to
me
i
could
help
it
no
matter
how
much
i
told
myself
that
i
was
playing
the
fool
i
made
the
most
idiotic
grimaces
behind
the
lady
back
and
coughed
frantically
as
i
passed
her
by
walking
on
in
this
manner
very
slowly
and
always
a
few
steps
in
advance
i
felt
her
eyes
on
my
back
and
involuntarily
put
down
my
head
with
shame
for
having
caused
her
annoyance
by
degrees
a
wonderful
feeling
stole
over
me
of
being
far
far
away
in
other
places
i
had
a
sense
that
it
was
not
i
who
was
going
along
over
the
gravel
hanging
my
head
a
few
minutes
later
they
reached
pascha
bookshop
i
had
already
stopped
at
the
first
window
and
as
they
go
by
i
step
forward
and
repeat
you
are
losing
your
book
madam
no
what
book
she
asks
affrightedly
can
you
make
out
what
book
it
is
he
is
talking
about
and
she
comes
to
a
stop
i
hug
myself
with
delight
at
her
confusion
the
irresolute
perplexity
in
her
eyes
positively
fascinates
me
her
mind
can
not
grasp
my
short
passionate
address
she
has
no
book
with
her
not
a
single
page
of
a
book
and
yet
she
fumbles
in
her
pockets
looks
down
repeatedly
at
her
hands
turns
her
head
and
scrutinizes
the
streets
behind
her
exerts
her
sensitive
little
brain
to
the
utmost
in
trying
to
discover
what
book
it
is
i
am
talking
about
her
face
changes
colour
has
now
one
now
another
expression
and
she
is
breathing
quite
audibly
even
the
very
buttons
on
her
gown
seem
to
stare
at
me
like
a
row
of
frightened
eyes
do
bother
about
him
says
her
companion
taking
her
by
the
arm
he
is
drunk
ca
you
see
that
the
man
is
drunk
strange
as
i
was
at
this
instant
to
myself
so
absolutely
a
prey
to
peculiar
invisible
inner
influences
nothing
occurred
around
me
without
my
observing
it
a
large
brown
dog
sprang
right
across
the
street
towards
the
shrubbery
and
then
down
towards
the
tivoli
he
had
on
a
very
narrow
collar
of
german
silver
farther
up
the
street
a
window
opened
on
the
second
floor
and
a
leant
out
of
it
with
her
sleeves
turned
up
and
began
to
clean
the
panes
on
the
outside
nothing
escaped
my
notice
i
was
and
everything
rushed
in
upon
me
with
a
gleaming
distinctness
as
if
i
were
suddenly
surrounded
by
a
strong
light
the
ladies
before
me
had
each
a
blue
bird
wing
in
their
hats
and
a
plaid
silk
ribbon
round
their
necks
it
struck
me
that
they
were
sisters
they
turned
stopped
at
cisler
and
spoke
together
i
stopped
also
thereupon
they
both
came
back
went
the
same
road
as
they
had
come
passed
me
again
and
turned
the
corner
of
university
street
and
up
towards
olav
place
i
was
all
the
time
as
close
at
their
heels
as
i
dared
to
be
they
turned
round
once
and
sent
me
a
look
and
i
saw
no
resentment
nor
any
trace
of
a
frown
in
it
this
forbearance
with
my
annoyance
shamed
me
thoroughly
and
made
me
lower
my
eyes
i
would
no
longer
be
a
trouble
to
them
out
of
sheer
gratitude
i
would
follow
them
with
my
gaze
not
lose
sight
of
them
until
they
entered
some
place
safely
and
disappeared
outside
no
a
large
house
they
turned
again
before
going
in
i
leant
against
a
near
the
fountain
and
listened
for
their
footsteps
on
the
stairs
they
died
away
on
the
second
floor
i
advanced
from
the
and
looked
up
at
the
house
then
something
odd
happened
the
curtains
above
were
stirred
and
a
second
after
a
window
opened
a
head
popped
out
and
two
eyes
dwelt
on
me
ylajali
i
muttered
and
i
felt
i
grew
red
why
does
she
not
call
for
help
or
push
over
one
of
these
and
strike
me
on
the
head
or
send
some
one
down
to
drive
me
away
we
stand
and
look
into
one
another
eyes
without
moving
it
lasts
a
minute
thoughts
dart
between
the
window
and
the
street
and
not
a
word
is
spoken
she
turns
round
i
feel
a
wrench
in
me
a
delicate
shock
through
my
senses
i
see
a
shoulder
that
turns
a
back
that
disappears
across
the
floor
that
reluctant
turning
from
the
window
the
accentuation
in
that
movement
of
the
shoulders
was
like
a
nod
to
me
my
blood
was
sensible
of
all
the
delicate
dainty
greeting
and
i
felt
all
at
once
rarely
glad
then
i
wheeled
round
and
went
down
the
street
i
dared
not
look
back
and
knew
not
if
she
had
returned
to
the
window
the
more
i
considered
this
question
the
more
nervous
and
restless
i
became
probably
at
this
very
moment
she
was
standing
watching
closely
all
my
movements
it
is
by
no
means
comfortable
to
know
that
you
are
being
watched
from
behind
your
back
i
pulled
myself
together
as
well
as
i
could
and
proceeded
on
my
way
my
legs
began
to
jerk
under
me
my
gait
became
unsteady
just
because
i
purposely
tried
to
make
it
look
well
in
order
to
appear
at
ease
and
indifferent
i
flung
my
arms
about
spat
out
and
threw
my
head
well
back
all
without
avail
for
i
continually
felt
the
pursuing
eyes
on
my
neck
and
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
my
back
at
length
i
escaped
down
a
side
street
from
which
i
took
the
road
to
pyle
street
to
get
my
pencil
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recovering
it
the
man
brought
me
the
waistcoat
himself
and
as
he
did
so
begged
me
to
search
through
all
the
pockets
i
found
also
a
couple
of
which
i
pocketed
as
i
thanked
the
obliging
little
man
for
his
civility
i
was
more
and
more
taken
with
him
and
grew
all
of
a
sudden
extremely
anxious
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
this
person
i
took
a
turn
towards
the
door
and
then
back
again
to
the
counter
as
if
i
had
forgotten
something
it
struck
me
that
i
owed
him
an
explanation
that
i
ought
to
elucidate
matters
a
little
i
began
to
hum
in
order
to
attract
his
attention
then
taking
the
pencil
in
my
hand
i
held
it
up
and
said
it
would
never
have
entered
my
head
to
come
such
a
long
way
for
any
and
every
bit
of
pencil
but
with
this
one
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
there
was
another
reason
a
special
reason
insignificant
as
it
looked
this
stump
of
pencil
had
simply
made
me
what
i
was
in
the
world
so
to
say
placed
me
in
life
i
said
no
more
the
man
had
come
right
over
to
the
counter
indeed
said
he
and
he
looked
inquiringly
at
me
it
was
with
this
pencil
i
continued
in
cold
blood
that
i
wrote
my
dissertation
on
cognition
in
three
volumes
had
he
never
heard
mention
of
it
well
he
did
seem
to
remember
having
heard
the
name
rather
the
title
yes
said
i
that
was
by
me
so
it
was
so
he
must
really
not
be
astonished
that
i
should
be
desirous
of
having
the
little
bit
of
pencil
back
again
i
valued
it
far
too
highly
to
lose
it
why
it
was
almost
as
much
to
me
as
a
little
human
creature
for
the
rest
i
was
honestly
grateful
to
him
for
his
civility
and
i
would
bear
him
in
mind
for
it
yes
truly
i
really
would
a
promise
was
a
promise
that
was
the
sort
of
man
i
was
and
he
really
deserved
it
i
walked
to
the
door
with
the
bearing
of
one
who
had
it
in
his
power
to
place
a
man
in
a
high
position
say
in
the
the
honest
pawnbroker
bowed
twice
profoundly
to
me
as
i
withdrew
i
turned
again
and
repeated
my
on
the
stairs
i
met
a
woman
with
a
in
her
hand
who
squeezed
diffidently
against
the
wall
to
make
room
for
me
and
i
voluntarily
thrust
my
hand
in
my
pocket
for
something
to
give
her
and
looked
foolish
as
i
found
nothing
and
passed
on
with
my
head
down
i
heard
her
knock
at
the
office
door
there
was
an
alarm
over
it
and
i
recognized
the
jingling
sound
it
gave
when
any
one
rapped
on
the
door
with
his
knuckles
the
sun
stood
in
the
south
it
was
about
twelve
the
whole
town
began
to
get
on
its
legs
as
it
approached
the
fashionable
hour
for
promenading
bowing
and
laughing
folk
walked
up
and
down
carl
johann
street
i
stuck
my
elbows
closely
to
my
sides
tried
to
make
myself
look
small
and
slipped
unperceived
past
some
acquaintances
who
had
taken
up
their
stand
at
the
corner
of
university
street
to
gaze
at
the
i
wandered
up
castle
hill
and
fell
into
a
reverie
how
gaily
and
lightly
these
people
i
met
carried
their
radiant
heads
and
swung
themselves
through
life
as
through
a
there
was
no
sorrow
in
a
single
look
i
met
no
burden
on
any
shoulder
perhaps
not
even
a
clouded
thought
not
a
little
hidden
pain
in
any
of
the
happy
souls
and
i
walking
in
the
very
midst
of
these
people
young
and
as
i
was
had
already
forgotten
the
very
look
of
happiness
i
hugged
these
thoughts
to
myself
as
i
went
on
and
found
that
a
great
injustice
had
been
done
me
why
had
the
last
months
pressed
so
strangely
hard
on
me
i
failed
to
recognize
my
own
happy
temperament
and
i
met
with
the
most
singular
annoyances
from
all
quarters
i
could
not
sit
down
on
a
bench
by
myself
or
set
my
foot
any
place
without
being
assailed
by
insignificant
accidents
miserable
details
that
forced
their
way
into
my
imagination
and
scattered
my
powers
to
all
the
four
winds
a
dog
that
dashed
by
me
a
yellow
rose
in
a
man
buttonhole
had
the
power
to
set
my
thoughts
vibrating
and
occupy
me
for
a
length
of
time
what
was
it
that
ailed
me
was
the
hand
of
the
lord
turned
against
me
but
why
just
against
me
why
for
that
matter
not
just
as
well
against
a
man
in
south
america
when
i
considered
the
matter
over
it
grew
more
and
more
incomprehensible
to
me
that
i
of
all
others
should
be
selected
as
an
experiment
for
a
creator
whims
it
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
a
peculiar
mode
of
procedure
to
pass
over
a
whole
world
of
other
humans
in
order
to
reach
me
why
not
select
just
as
well
bookseller
pascha
or
hennechen
the
steam
agent
as
i
went
my
way
i
sifted
this
thing
and
could
not
get
quit
of
it
i
found
the
most
weighty
arguments
against
the
creator
arbitrariness
in
letting
me
pay
for
all
the
others
sins
even
after
i
had
found
a
seat
and
sat
down
the
query
persisted
in
occupying
me
and
prevented
me
from
thinking
of
aught
else
from
the
day
in
may
when
my
began
i
could
so
clearly
notice
my
gradually
increasing
debility
i
had
become
as
it
were
too
languid
to
control
or
lead
myself
whither
i
would
go
a
swarm
of
tiny
noxious
animals
had
bored
a
way
into
my
inner
man
and
hollowed
me
out
supposing
god
almighty
simply
intended
to
annihilate
me
i
got
up
and
paced
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
seat
my
whole
being
was
at
this
moment
in
the
highest
degree
of
torture
i
had
pains
in
my
arms
and
could
hardly
bear
to
hold
them
in
the
usual
way
i
experienced
also
great
discomfort
from
my
last
full
meal
i
was
oversated
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
without
looking
up
the
people
who
came
and
went
around
me
glided
past
me
like
faint
gleams
at
last
my
seat
was
taken
up
by
two
men
who
lit
cigars
and
began
to
talk
loudly
together
i
got
angry
and
was
on
the
point
of
addressing
them
but
turned
on
my
heel
and
went
right
to
the
other
end
of
the
park
and
found
another
seat
i
sat
down
the
thought
of
god
began
to
occupy
me
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
highest
degree
indefensible
of
him
to
interfere
every
time
i
sought
for
a
place
and
to
upset
the
whole
thing
while
all
the
time
i
was
but
imploring
enough
for
a
daily
meal
i
had
remarked
so
plainly
that
whenever
i
had
been
hungry
for
any
length
of
time
it
was
just
as
if
my
brains
ran
quite
gently
out
of
my
head
and
left
me
with
a
vacuum
my
head
grew
light
and
far
off
i
no
longer
felt
its
weight
on
my
shoulders
and
i
had
a
consciousness
that
my
eyes
stared
far
too
widely
open
when
i
looked
at
anything
i
sat
there
on
the
seat
and
pondered
over
all
this
and
grew
more
and
more
bitter
against
god
for
his
prolonged
inflictions
if
he
meant
to
draw
me
nearer
to
him
and
make
me
better
by
exhausting
me
and
placing
obstacle
after
obstacle
in
my
way
i
could
assure
him
he
made
a
slight
mistake
and
almost
crying
with
defiance
i
looked
up
towards
heaven
and
told
him
so
mentally
once
and
for
all
fragments
of
the
teachings
of
my
childhood
ran
through
my
memory
the
rhythmical
sound
of
biblical
language
sang
in
my
ears
and
i
talked
quite
softly
to
myself
and
held
my
head
sneeringly
askew
wherefore
should
i
sorrow
for
what
i
eat
for
what
i
drink
or
for
what
i
may
array
this
miserable
food
for
worms
called
my
earthy
body
hath
not
my
heavenly
father
provided
for
me
even
as
for
the
sparrow
on
the
housetop
and
hath
he
not
in
his
graciousness
pointed
towards
his
lowly
servitor
the
lord
stuck
his
finger
in
the
net
of
my
nerves
gently
yea
verily
in
desultory
fashion
and
brought
slight
disorder
among
the
threads
and
then
the
lord
withdrew
his
finger
and
there
were
fibres
and
delicate
filaments
adhering
to
the
finger
and
they
were
the
of
the
filaments
and
there
was
a
gaping
hole
after
the
finger
which
was
god
finger
and
a
wound
in
my
brain
in
the
track
of
his
finger
but
when
god
had
touched
me
with
his
finger
he
let
me
be
and
touched
me
no
more
and
let
no
evil
befall
me
but
let
me
depart
in
peace
and
let
me
depart
with
the
gaping
hole
and
no
evil
hath
befallen
me
from
the
god
who
is
the
lord
god
of
all
eternity
the
sound
of
music
was
borne
up
on
the
wind
to
me
from
the
allée
it
was
therefore
past
two
i
took
out
my
writing
materials
to
try
to
write
something
and
at
the
same
time
my
book
of
footnote
issued
by
the
barbers
at
cheaper
rates
as
few
men
in
norway
shave
themselves
fell
out
of
my
pocket
i
opened
it
and
counted
the
tickets
there
were
six
the
lord
be
praised
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
i
can
still
get
shaved
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
look
a
little
decent
and
i
immediately
fell
into
a
better
frame
of
mind
on
account
of
this
little
property
which
still
remained
to
me
i
smoothed
the
leaves
out
carefully
and
put
the
book
safely
into
my
pocket
but
write
i
could
not
after
a
few
lines
nothing
seemed
to
occur
to
me
my
thought
ran
in
other
directions
and
i
could
not
pull
myself
together
enough
for
any
special
exertion
everything
influenced
and
distracted
me
everything
i
saw
made
a
fresh
impression
on
me
flies
and
tiny
mosquitoes
stick
fast
to
the
paper
and
disturb
me
i
blow
at
them
to
get
rid
of
them
blow
harder
and
harder
to
no
purpose
the
little
pests
throw
themselves
on
their
backs
make
themselves
heavy
and
fight
against
me
until
their
slender
legs
bend
they
are
not
to
be
moved
from
the
spot
they
find
something
to
hook
on
to
set
their
heels
against
a
comma
or
an
unevenness
in
the
paper
or
stand
immovably
still
until
they
themselves
think
fit
to
go
their
way
these
insects
continued
to
busy
me
for
a
long
time
and
i
crossed
my
legs
to
observe
them
at
leisure
all
at
once
a
couple
of
high
clarionet
notes
waved
up
to
me
from
the
bandstand
and
gave
my
thoughts
a
new
impulse
despondent
at
not
being
able
to
put
my
article
together
i
replaced
the
paper
in
my
pocket
and
leant
back
in
the
seat
at
this
instant
my
head
is
so
clear
that
i
can
follow
the
most
delicate
train
of
thought
without
tiring
as
i
lie
in
this
position
and
let
my
eyes
glide
down
my
breast
and
along
my
legs
i
notice
the
jerking
movement
my
foot
makes
each
time
my
pulse
beats
i
half
rise
and
look
down
at
my
feet
and
i
experience
at
this
moment
a
fantastic
and
singular
feeling
that
i
have
never
felt
before
a
delicate
wonderful
shock
through
my
nerves
as
if
sparks
of
cold
light
quivered
through
them
it
was
as
if
catching
sight
of
my
shoes
i
had
met
with
a
kind
old
acquaintance
or
got
back
a
part
of
myself
that
had
been
riven
loose
a
feeling
of
recognition
trembles
through
my
senses
the
tears
well
up
in
my
eyes
and
i
have
a
feeling
as
if
my
shoes
are
a
soft
murmuring
strain
rising
towards
me
weakness
i
cried
harshly
to
myself
and
i
clenched
my
fists
and
i
repeated
weakness
i
laughed
at
myself
for
this
ridiculous
feeling
made
fun
of
myself
with
a
perfect
consciousness
of
doing
so
talked
very
severely
and
sensibly
and
closed
my
eyes
very
tightly
to
get
rid
of
the
tears
as
if
i
had
never
seen
my
shoes
before
i
set
myself
to
study
their
looks
their
characteristics
and
when
i
stir
my
foot
their
shape
and
their
worn
uppers
i
discover
that
their
creases
and
white
seams
give
them
expression
impart
a
physiognomy
to
them
something
of
my
own
nature
had
gone
over
into
these
shoes
they
affected
me
like
a
ghost
of
my
other
i
a
breathing
portion
of
my
very
self
i
sat
and
toyed
with
these
fancies
a
long
time
perhaps
an
entire
hour
a
little
old
man
came
and
took
the
other
end
of
the
seat
as
he
seated
himself
he
panted
after
his
walk
and
muttered
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
ay
very
true
as
soon
as
i
heard
his
voice
i
felt
as
if
a
wind
had
swept
through
my
head
i
let
shoes
be
shoes
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
distracted
phase
of
mind
i
had
just
experienced
dated
from
a
period
maybe
a
year
or
two
back
and
was
about
to
be
quietly
effaced
from
my
memory
i
began
to
observe
the
old
fellow
did
this
little
man
concern
me
in
any
way
not
in
the
least
not
in
the
very
slightest
degree
only
that
he
held
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
an
old
number
with
the
advertisement
sheet
on
the
outside
in
which
something
or
other
seemed
to
be
rolled
up
my
curiosity
was
aroused
and
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
away
from
this
paper
the
insane
idea
entered
my
head
that
it
might
be
a
quite
peculiar
newspaper
unique
of
its
kind
my
curiosity
increased
and
i
began
to
move
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
seat
it
might
contain
deeds
dangerous
documents
stolen
from
some
archive
or
other
something
floated
before
me
about
a
secret
treaty
a
conspiracy
the
man
sat
quietly
and
pondered
why
did
he
not
carry
his
newspaper
as
every
other
person
carries
a
paper
with
its
name
out
what
species
of
cunning
lurked
under
that
he
did
not
seem
either
to
like
letting
his
package
out
of
his
hands
not
for
anything
in
the
world
perhaps
he
did
not
even
dare
trust
it
into
his
own
pocket
i
could
stake
my
life
there
was
something
at
the
bottom
of
that
package
i
considered
a
bit
just
the
fact
of
finding
it
so
impossible
to
penetrate
this
mysterious
affair
distracted
me
with
curiosity
i
searched
my
pockets
for
something
to
offer
the
man
in
order
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
took
hold
of
my
but
put
it
back
again
suddenly
it
entered
my
head
to
be
utterly
audacious
i
slapped
my
empty
and
said
may
i
offer
you
a
cigarette
thank
you
the
man
did
not
smoke
he
had
to
give
it
up
to
spare
his
eyes
he
was
nearly
blind
thank
you
very
much
all
the
same
was
it
long
since
his
eyes
got
bad
in
that
case
perhaps
he
could
not
read
either
not
even
a
paper
no
not
even
the
newspaper
more
the
pity
the
man
looked
at
me
his
weak
eyes
were
each
covered
with
a
film
which
gave
them
a
glassy
appearance
his
gaze
grew
bleary
and
made
a
disgusting
impression
on
me
you
are
a
stranger
here
he
said
yes
could
he
not
even
read
the
name
of
the
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
barely
for
that
matter
he
could
hear
directly
that
i
was
a
stranger
there
was
something
in
my
accent
which
told
him
it
did
not
need
much
he
could
hear
so
well
at
night
when
every
one
slept
he
could
hear
people
in
the
next
room
breathing
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
do
you
live
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
lie
stood
in
my
head
i
lied
involuntarily
without
any
object
without
any
and
i
answered
olav
place
no
really
he
knew
every
stone
in
olav
place
there
was
a
fountain
some
a
few
trees
he
remembered
all
of
it
what
number
do
you
live
in
desirous
to
put
an
end
to
this
i
got
up
but
my
notion
about
the
newspaper
had
driven
me
to
my
wit
end
i
resolved
to
clear
the
thing
up
at
no
matter
what
cost
when
you
can
not
read
the
paper
why
in
no
i
think
you
said
continued
the
man
without
noticing
my
disturbance
there
was
a
time
i
knew
every
person
in
no
what
is
your
landlord
name
i
quickly
found
a
name
to
get
rid
of
him
invented
one
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
blurted
it
out
to
stop
my
tormentor
happolati
said
i
happolati
ay
nodded
the
man
and
he
never
missed
a
syllable
of
this
difficult
name
i
looked
at
him
with
amazement
there
he
sat
gravely
with
a
considering
air
before
i
had
well
given
utterance
to
the
stupid
name
which
jumped
into
my
head
the
man
had
accommodated
himself
to
it
and
pretended
to
have
heard
it
before
in
the
meantime
he
had
laid
his
package
on
the
seat
and
i
felt
my
curiosity
quiver
through
my
nerves
i
noticed
there
were
a
few
grease
spots
on
the
paper
is
he
a
man
your
landlord
queried
he
and
there
was
not
a
trace
of
suppressed
irony
in
his
voice
i
seem
to
remember
he
was
man
excuse
me
it
must
be
the
brother
you
know
this
man
is
namely
j
happolati
the
agent
i
thought
this
would
finish
him
but
he
willingly
fell
in
with
everything
i
said
if
i
had
found
a
name
like
barrabas
rosebud
it
would
not
have
roused
his
suspicions
he
is
an
able
man
i
have
heard
he
said
feeling
his
way
oh
a
clever
fellow
answered
i
a
thorough
business
head
agent
for
every
possible
thing
going
cranberries
from
china
feathers
and
down
from
russia
hides
pulp
he
he
the
devil
he
is
interrupted
the
old
chap
highly
excited
this
began
to
get
interesting
the
situation
ran
away
with
me
and
one
lie
after
another
engendered
in
my
head
i
sat
down
again
forgot
the
newspaper
and
the
remarkable
documents
grew
lively
and
cut
short
the
old
fellow
talk
the
little
goblin
unsuspecting
simplicity
made
me
foolhardy
i
would
stuff
him
recklessly
full
of
lies
rout
him
out
o
field
grandly
and
stop
his
mouth
from
sheer
amazement
had
he
heard
of
the
electric
that
happolati
had
invented
what
elec
with
electric
letters
that
could
give
light
in
the
dark
a
perfectly
extraordinary
enterprise
a
million
crowns
to
be
put
in
circulation
foundries
and
at
work
and
shoals
of
regular
mechanics
to
be
employed
i
had
heard
as
many
as
seven
hundred
men
ay
is
it
just
what
i
say
drawled
out
the
man
calmly
he
said
no
more
he
believed
every
word
i
related
and
for
all
that
he
was
not
taken
aback
this
disappointed
me
a
little
i
had
expected
to
see
him
utterly
bewildered
by
my
inventions
i
searched
my
brain
for
a
couple
of
desperate
lies
went
the
whole
hog
hinted
that
happolati
had
been
minister
of
state
for
nine
years
in
persia
you
perhaps
have
no
conception
of
what
it
means
to
be
minister
of
state
in
persia
i
asked
it
was
more
than
king
here
or
about
the
same
as
sultan
if
he
knew
what
that
meant
but
happolati
had
managed
the
whole
thing
and
was
never
at
a
loss
and
i
related
about
his
daughter
ylajali
a
fairy
a
princess
who
had
three
hundred
slaves
and
who
reclined
on
a
couch
of
yellow
roses
she
was
the
loveliest
creature
i
had
ever
seen
i
had
may
the
lord
strike
me
never
seen
her
match
for
looks
in
my
life
so
o
was
she
so
lovely
remarked
the
old
fellow
with
an
absent
air
as
he
gazed
at
the
ground
lovely
she
was
beauteous
she
was
sinfully
fascinating
eyes
like
raw
silk
arms
of
amber
just
one
glance
from
her
was
as
seductive
as
a
kiss
and
when
she
called
me
her
voice
darted
like
a
right
into
my
soul
phosphor
and
why
should
she
be
so
beautiful
did
he
imagine
she
was
a
messenger
or
something
in
the
fire
brigade
she
was
simply
a
heaven
wonder
i
could
just
inform
him
a
fairy
tale
yes
to
be
sure
said
he
not
a
little
bewildered
his
quiet
bored
me
i
was
excited
by
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
and
spoke
in
utter
seriousness
the
stolen
archives
treaties
with
some
foreign
power
or
other
no
longer
occupied
my
thoughts
the
little
flat
bundle
of
paper
lay
on
the
seat
between
us
and
i
had
no
longer
the
smallest
desire
to
examine
it
or
see
what
it
contained
i
was
entirely
absorbed
in
stories
of
my
own
which
floated
in
singular
visions
across
my
mental
eye
the
blood
flew
to
my
head
and
i
roared
with
laughter
at
this
moment
the
little
man
seemed
about
to
go
he
stretched
himself
and
in
order
not
to
break
off
too
abruptly
added
he
is
said
to
own
much
property
this
happolati
how
dared
this
disgusting
old
man
toss
about
the
rare
name
i
had
invented
as
if
it
were
a
common
name
stuck
up
over
every
in
the
town
he
never
stumbled
over
a
letter
or
forgot
a
syllable
the
name
had
bitten
fast
in
his
brain
and
struck
root
on
the
instant
i
got
annoyed
an
inward
exasperation
surged
up
in
me
against
this
creature
whom
nothing
had
the
power
to
disturb
and
nothing
render
suspicious
i
therefore
replied
shortly
i
know
nothing
about
that
i
know
absolutely
nothing
whatever
about
that
let
me
inform
you
once
for
all
that
his
name
is
johann
arendt
happolati
if
you
go
by
his
own
initials
johannn
arendt
happolati
repeated
the
man
a
little
astonished
at
my
vehemence
and
with
that
he
grew
silent
you
should
see
his
wife
i
said
beside
myself
a
fatter
creature
eh
what
perhaps
you
do
even
believe
she
is
really
fat
well
indeed
he
did
not
see
his
way
to
deny
that
such
a
man
might
perhaps
have
a
rather
stout
wife
the
old
fellow
answered
quite
gently
and
meekly
to
each
of
my
assertions
and
sought
for
words
as
if
he
feared
to
offend
and
perhaps
make
me
furious
hell
and
fire
man
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
sitting
here
stuffing
you
of
lies
i
roared
furiously
perhaps
you
do
even
believe
that
a
man
of
the
name
of
happolati
exists
i
never
saw
your
match
for
obstinacy
and
malice
in
any
old
man
what
the
devil
ails
you
perhaps
too
into
the
bargain
you
have
been
all
this
while
thinking
to
yourself
i
am
a
fellow
sitting
here
in
my
without
even
a
case
full
of
cigarettes
in
my
pocket
let
me
tell
you
such
treatment
as
yours
is
a
thing
i
am
not
accustomed
to
and
i
wo
endure
it
the
lord
strike
me
dead
if
i
will
neither
from
you
nor
any
one
else
do
you
know
that
the
man
had
risen
with
his
mouth
agape
he
stood
and
listened
to
my
outbreak
until
the
end
then
he
snatched
his
parcel
from
off
the
seat
and
went
ay
nearly
ran
down
the
patch
with
the
short
tottering
steps
of
an
old
man
i
leant
back
and
looked
at
the
retreating
figure
that
seemed
to
shrink
at
each
step
as
it
passed
away
i
do
not
know
from
where
the
impression
came
but
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
a
more
vile
back
than
this
one
and
i
did
not
regret
that
i
had
abused
the
creature
before
he
left
me
the
day
began
to
decline
the
sun
sank
it
commenced
to
rustle
lightly
in
the
trees
around
and
the
nursemaids
who
sat
in
groups
near
the
parallel
bars
made
ready
to
wheel
their
perambulators
home
i
was
calmed
and
in
good
spirit
the
excitement
i
had
just
laboured
under
quieted
down
little
by
little
and
i
grew
weaker
more
languid
and
began
to
feel
drowsy
neither
did
the
quantity
of
bread
i
had
eaten
cause
me
any
longer
any
particular
distress
i
leant
against
the
back
of
the
seat
in
the
best
of
humours
closed
my
eyes
and
got
more
and
more
sleepy
i
dozed
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
falling
asleep
when
a
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
you
must
not
sit
here
and
go
to
sleep
no
i
said
and
sprang
immediately
up
my
unfortunate
position
rising
all
at
once
vividly
before
my
eyes
i
must
do
something
find
some
way
or
another
out
of
it
to
look
for
situations
had
been
of
no
avail
to
me
even
the
recommendations
i
showed
had
grown
a
little
old
and
were
written
by
people
all
too
little
known
to
be
of
much
use
besides
that
constant
refusals
all
through
the
summer
had
somewhat
disheartened
me
at
all
events
my
rent
was
due
and
i
must
raise
the
wind
for
that
the
rest
would
have
to
wait
a
little
quite
involuntarily
i
had
got
paper
and
pencil
into
my
hand
again
and
i
sat
and
wrote
mechanically
the
date
in
each
corner
if
only
now
one
single
effervescing
thought
would
grip
me
powerfully
and
put
words
into
my
mouth
why
i
had
known
hours
when
i
could
write
a
long
piece
without
the
least
exertion
and
turn
it
off
capitally
too
i
am
sitting
on
the
seat
and
i
write
scores
of
times
i
write
this
date
in
all
possible
fashions
and
wait
until
a
workable
idea
shall
occur
to
me
a
swarm
of
loose
thoughts
flutter
about
in
my
head
the
feeling
of
declining
day
makes
me
downcast
sentimental
autumn
is
here
and
has
already
begun
to
hush
everything
into
sleep
and
torpor
the
flies
and
insects
have
received
their
first
warning
up
in
the
trees
and
down
in
the
fields
the
sounds
of
struggling
life
can
be
heard
rustling
murmuring
restless
labouring
not
to
perish
the
existence
of
the
whole
insect
world
is
astir
for
yet
a
little
while
they
poke
their
yellow
heads
up
from
the
turf
lift
their
legs
feel
their
way
with
long
feelers
and
then
collapse
suddenly
roll
over
and
turn
their
bellies
in
the
air
every
growing
thing
has
received
its
peculiar
impress
the
delicately
blown
breath
of
the
first
cold
the
stubbles
straggle
wanly
sunwards
and
the
falling
leaves
rustle
to
the
earth
with
a
sound
as
of
errant
silkworms
it
is
the
reign
of
autumn
the
height
of
the
carnival
of
decay
the
roses
have
got
inflammation
in
their
blushes
an
uncanny
hectic
tinge
through
their
soft
damask
i
felt
myself
like
a
creeping
thing
on
the
verge
of
destruction
gripped
by
ruin
in
the
midst
of
a
whole
world
ready
for
lethargic
sleep
i
rose
oppressed
by
weird
terrors
and
took
some
furious
strides
down
the
path
no
i
cried
out
clutching
both
my
hands
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
and
i
reseated
myself
grasped
the
pencil
and
set
seriously
to
work
at
an
article
there
was
no
possible
use
in
giving
way
with
the
unpaid
rent
staring
me
straight
in
the
face
slowly
quite
slowly
my
thoughts
collected
i
paid
attention
to
them
and
wrote
quietly
and
well
wrote
a
couple
of
pages
as
an
introduction
it
would
serve
as
a
beginning
to
anything
a
description
of
travel
a
political
leader
just
as
i
thought
fit
it
was
a
perfectly
splendid
commencement
for
something
or
anything
so
i
took
to
seeking
for
some
particular
subject
to
handle
a
person
or
a
thing
that
i
might
grapple
with
and
i
could
find
nothing
along
with
this
fruitless
exertion
disorder
began
to
hold
its
sway
again
in
my
thoughts
i
felt
how
my
brain
positively
snapped
and
my
head
emptied
until
it
sat
at
last
light
buoyant
and
void
on
my
shoulders
i
was
conscious
of
the
gaping
vacuum
in
my
skull
with
every
fibre
of
my
being
i
seemed
to
myself
to
be
hollowed
out
from
top
and
toe
in
my
pain
i
cried
lord
my
god
and
father
and
repeated
this
cry
many
times
at
a
stretch
without
adding
one
word
more
the
wind
soughed
through
the
trees
a
storm
was
brewing
i
sat
a
while
longer
and
gazed
at
my
paper
lost
in
thought
then
folded
it
up
and
put
it
slowly
into
my
pocket
it
got
chilly
and
i
no
longer
owned
a
waistcoat
i
buttoned
my
coat
right
up
to
my
throat
and
thrust
my
hands
in
my
pockets
thereupon
i
rose
and
went
on
if
i
had
only
succeeded
this
time
just
this
once
twice
my
landlady
had
asked
me
with
her
eyes
for
payment
and
i
was
obliged
to
hang
my
head
and
slink
past
her
with
a
shamefaced
air
i
could
not
do
it
again
the
very
next
time
i
met
those
eyes
i
would
give
warning
and
account
for
myself
honestly
well
any
way
things
could
not
last
long
at
this
rate
on
coming
to
the
exit
of
the
park
i
saw
the
old
chap
i
had
put
to
flight
the
mysterious
new
paper
parcel
lay
opened
on
the
seat
next
him
filled
with
different
sorts
of
victuals
of
which
he
ate
as
he
sat
i
immediately
wanted
to
go
over
and
ask
pardon
for
my
conduct
but
the
sight
of
food
repelled
me
the
decrepit
fingers
looked
like
ten
claws
as
they
clutched
loathsomely
at
the
greasy
bread
and
butter
i
felt
qualmish
and
passed
by
without
addressing
him
he
did
not
recognize
me
his
eyes
stared
at
me
dry
as
horn
and
his
face
did
not
move
a
muscle
and
so
i
went
on
my
way
as
customary
i
halted
before
every
newspaper
placard
i
came
to
to
read
the
announcements
of
situations
vacant
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
one
that
i
might
try
for
a
grocer
in
groenlandsleret
wanted
a
man
every
week
for
a
couple
of
hours
remuneration
according
to
agreement
i
noted
my
man
address
and
prayed
to
god
in
silence
for
this
place
i
would
demand
less
than
any
one
else
for
my
work
sixpence
was
ample
or
perhaps
fivepence
that
would
not
matter
in
the
least
on
going
home
a
slip
of
paper
from
my
landlady
lay
on
my
table
in
which
she
begged
me
to
pay
my
rent
in
advance
or
else
move
as
soon
as
i
could
i
must
not
be
offended
it
was
absolutely
a
necessary
request
friendlily
gundersen
i
wrote
an
application
to
christy
the
grocer
no
groenlandsleret
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
took
it
to
the
pillar
at
the
corner
then
i
returned
to
my
room
and
sat
down
in
the
to
think
whilst
the
darkness
grew
closer
and
closer
sitting
up
late
began
to
be
difficult
now
i
woke
very
early
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
dark
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
it
was
not
till
long
after
that
i
heard
five
strokes
of
the
clock
i
turned
round
to
doze
again
but
sleep
had
down
i
grew
more
and
more
wakeful
and
lay
and
thought
of
a
thousand
things
suddenly
a
few
good
sentences
fitted
for
a
sketch
or
story
strike
me
delicate
linguistic
hits
of
which
i
have
never
before
found
the
equal
i
lie
and
repeat
these
words
over
to
myself
and
find
that
they
are
capital
little
by
little
others
come
and
fit
themselves
to
the
preceding
ones
i
grow
keenly
wakeful
i
get
up
and
snatch
paper
and
pencil
from
the
table
behind
my
bed
it
was
as
if
a
vein
had
burst
in
me
one
word
follows
another
and
they
fit
themselves
together
harmoniously
with
telling
effect
scene
piles
on
scene
actions
and
speeches
bubble
up
in
my
brain
and
a
wonderful
sense
of
pleasure
empowers
me
i
write
as
one
possessed
and
fill
page
after
page
without
a
moment
pause
thoughts
come
so
swiftly
to
me
and
continue
to
flow
so
richly
that
i
miss
a
number
of
telling
bits
that
i
can
not
set
down
quickly
enough
although
i
work
with
all
my
might
they
continue
to
invade
me
i
am
full
of
my
subject
and
every
word
i
write
is
inspired
this
strange
period
lasts
lasts
such
a
blessedly
long
time
before
it
comes
to
an
end
i
have
fifteen
twenty
written
pages
lying
on
my
knees
before
me
when
at
last
i
cease
and
lay
my
pencil
aside
so
sure
as
there
is
any
worth
in
these
pages
so
sure
am
i
saved
i
jump
out
of
bed
and
dress
myself
it
grows
lighter
i
can
half
distinguish
the
lighthouse
director
announcement
down
near
the
door
and
near
the
window
it
is
already
so
light
that
i
could
in
case
of
necessity
see
to
write
i
set
to
work
immediately
to
make
a
fair
copy
of
what
i
have
written
an
intense
peculiar
exhalation
of
light
and
colour
emanates
from
these
fantasies
of
mine
i
start
with
surprise
as
i
note
one
good
thing
after
another
and
tell
myself
that
this
is
the
best
thing
i
have
ever
read
my
head
swims
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
delight
inflates
me
i
grow
grandiose
i
weigh
my
writing
in
my
hand
and
value
it
at
a
loose
guess
for
five
shillings
on
the
spot
it
could
never
enter
any
one
head
to
chaffer
about
five
shillings
on
the
contrary
getting
it
for
might
be
considered
considering
the
quality
of
the
thing
i
had
no
intention
of
turning
off
such
special
work
gratis
as
far
as
i
was
aware
one
did
not
pick
up
stories
of
that
kind
on
the
wayside
and
i
decided
on
the
room
brightened
and
brightened
i
threw
a
glance
towards
the
door
and
could
distinguish
without
particular
trouble
the
letters
of
miss
andersen
advertisement
to
the
right
of
it
it
was
also
a
good
while
since
the
clock
has
struck
seven
i
rose
and
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
everything
well
considered
gundersen
warning
came
rather
opportunely
this
was
properly
speaking
no
fit
room
for
me
there
were
only
common
enough
green
curtains
at
the
windows
and
neither
were
there
any
pegs
too
many
on
the
wall
the
poor
little
over
in
the
corner
was
in
reality
a
mere
attempt
at
a
with
the
smallest
sense
of
humour
one
might
easily
split
one
sides
with
laughter
at
it
it
was
far
too
low
for
a
grown
man
and
besides
that
one
needed
so
to
speak
the
aid
of
a
to
get
out
of
it
to
cut
it
short
the
room
was
not
adopted
for
the
pursuit
of
things
intellectual
and
i
did
not
intend
to
keep
it
any
longer
on
no
account
would
i
keep
it
i
had
held
my
peace
and
endured
and
lived
far
too
long
in
such
a
den
buoyed
up
by
hope
and
satisfaction
constantly
occupied
with
my
remarkable
sketch
which
i
drew
forth
every
moment
from
my
pocket
and
i
determined
to
set
seriously
to
work
with
my
flitting
i
took
out
my
bundle
a
red
handkerchief
that
contained
a
few
clean
collars
and
some
crumpled
newspapers
in
which
i
had
occasionally
carried
home
bread
i
rolled
my
blanket
up
and
pocketed
my
reserve
white
then
i
ransacked
every
corner
to
assure
myself
that
i
had
left
nothing
behind
and
as
i
could
not
find
anything
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
morning
was
gloomy
and
wet
there
was
no
one
about
at
the
smithy
and
the
clothesline
down
in
the
yard
stretched
tightly
from
wall
to
wall
shrunken
by
the
wet
it
was
all
familiar
to
me
so
i
stepped
back
from
the
window
took
the
blanket
under
my
arm
and
made
a
low
bow
to
the
lighthouse
director
announcement
bowed
again
to
miss
andersen
advertisement
and
opened
the
door
suddenly
the
thought
of
my
struck
me
she
really
ought
to
be
informed
of
my
leaving
so
that
she
could
see
she
had
had
an
honest
soul
to
deal
with
i
wanted
also
to
thank
her
in
writing
for
the
few
days
overtime
in
which
i
occupied
the
room
the
certainty
that
i
was
now
saved
for
some
time
to
come
increased
so
strongly
in
me
that
i
even
promised
her
five
shillings
i
would
call
in
some
day
when
passing
by
besides
that
i
wanted
to
prove
to
her
what
an
upright
sort
of
person
her
roof
had
sheltered
i
left
the
note
behind
me
on
the
table
once
again
i
stopped
at
the
door
and
turned
round
the
buoyant
feeling
of
having
risen
once
again
to
the
surface
charmed
me
and
made
me
feel
grateful
towards
god
and
all
creation
and
i
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
and
thanked
god
aloud
for
his
great
goodness
to
me
that
morning
i
knew
it
ah
i
knew
that
the
rapture
of
inspiration
i
had
just
felt
and
noted
down
was
a
miraculous
in
my
spirit
in
answer
to
my
yesterday
cry
for
aid
it
was
god
it
was
god
i
cried
to
myself
and
i
wept
for
enthusiasm
over
my
own
words
now
and
then
i
had
to
stop
and
listen
if
any
one
was
on
the
stairs
at
last
i
rose
up
and
prepared
to
go
i
stole
noiselessly
down
each
flight
and
reached
the
door
unseen
the
streets
were
glistening
from
the
rain
which
had
fallen
in
the
early
morning
the
sky
hung
damp
and
heavy
over
the
town
and
there
was
no
glint
of
sunlight
visible
i
wondered
what
the
day
would
bring
forth
i
went
as
usual
in
the
direction
of
the
town
hall
and
saw
that
it
was
eight
i
had
yet
a
few
hours
to
walk
about
there
was
no
use
in
going
to
the
newspaper
office
before
ten
perhaps
eleven
i
must
lounge
about
so
long
and
think
in
the
meantime
over
some
expedient
to
raise
breakfast
for
that
matter
i
had
no
fear
of
going
to
bed
hungry
that
day
those
times
were
over
god
be
praised
that
was
a
thing
of
the
past
an
evil
dream
henceforth
excelsior
but
in
the
meanwhile
the
green
blanket
was
a
trouble
to
me
neither
could
i
well
make
myself
conspicuous
by
carrying
such
a
thing
about
right
under
people
eyes
what
would
any
one
think
of
me
and
as
i
went
on
i
tried
to
think
of
a
place
where
i
could
have
it
kept
till
later
on
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
go
into
semb
and
get
it
wrapped
up
in
paper
not
only
would
it
look
better
but
i
need
no
longer
be
ashamed
of
carrying
it
i
entered
the
shop
and
stated
my
errand
to
one
of
the
shop
boys
he
looked
first
at
the
blanket
then
at
me
it
struck
me
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
himself
a
little
contemptuously
as
he
took
it
this
annoyed
me
young
man
i
cried
do
be
a
little
careful
there
are
two
costly
glass
vases
in
that
the
parcel
has
to
go
to
smyrna
this
had
a
famous
effect
the
fellow
apologized
with
every
movement
he
made
for
not
having
guessed
that
there
was
something
out
of
the
common
in
this
blanket
when
he
had
finished
packing
it
up
i
thanked
him
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
sent
precious
goods
to
smyrna
before
now
he
held
the
door
open
for
me
and
bowed
twice
as
i
left
i
began
to
wander
about
amongst
the
people
in
the
market
place
kept
from
choice
near
the
woman
who
had
potted
plants
for
sale
the
heavy
crimson
roses
the
leaves
of
which
glowed
and
moist
in
the
damp
morning
made
me
envious
and
tempted
me
sinfully
to
snatch
one
and
i
inquired
the
price
of
them
merely
as
an
excuse
to
approach
as
near
to
them
as
possible
if
i
had
any
money
over
i
would
buy
one
no
matter
how
things
went
indeed
i
might
well
save
a
little
now
and
then
out
of
my
way
of
living
to
balance
things
again
it
was
ten
and
i
went
up
to
the
newspaper
office
scissors
is
running
through
a
lot
of
old
papers
the
editor
has
not
come
yet
on
being
asked
my
business
i
delivered
my
weighty
manuscript
lead
him
to
suppose
that
it
is
something
of
more
than
uncommon
importance
and
impress
upon
his
memory
gravely
that
he
is
to
give
it
into
we
own
hands
as
soon
as
he
arrives
i
would
myself
call
later
on
in
the
day
for
an
answer
all
right
replied
scissors
and
busied
himself
again
with
his
papers
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
treated
the
matter
somewhat
too
coolly
but
i
said
nothing
only
nodded
rather
carelessly
to
him
and
left
i
had
now
time
on
hand
if
it
would
only
clear
up
it
was
perfectly
wretched
weather
without
either
wind
or
freshness
ladies
carried
their
umbrellas
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
the
woollen
caps
of
the
men
looked
limp
and
depressing
i
took
another
turn
across
the
market
and
looked
at
the
vegetables
and
roses
i
feel
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
turn
round
missy
bids
me
good
morning
i
say
in
return
a
little
questioningly
i
never
cared
particularly
for
missy
he
looks
inquisitively
at
the
large
parcel
under
my
arm
and
asks
what
have
you
got
there
oh
i
have
been
down
to
semb
and
got
some
cloth
for
a
suit
i
reply
in
a
careless
tone
i
did
think
i
could
rub
on
any
longer
such
a
thing
as
treating
oneself
too
shabbily
he
looks
at
me
with
an
amazed
start
by
the
way
how
are
you
getting
on
he
asks
it
slowly
oh
beyond
all
expectation
then
you
have
got
something
to
do
now
something
to
do
i
answer
and
seem
surprised
rather
why
i
am
at
christensen
a
wholesale
house
oh
indeed
he
remarks
and
draws
back
a
little
well
god
knows
i
am
the
first
to
be
pleased
at
your
success
if
only
you
do
let
people
beg
the
money
from
you
that
you
earn
a
second
after
he
wheels
round
and
comes
back
and
pointing
with
his
cane
to
my
parcel
says
i
would
recommend
my
tailor
to
you
for
the
suit
of
clothes
you
find
a
better
tailor
than
isaksen
just
say
i
sent
you
that
all
this
was
really
rather
more
than
i
could
swallow
what
did
he
want
to
poke
his
nose
in
my
affairs
for
was
it
any
concern
of
his
which
tailor
i
employed
the
sight
of
this
dandified
masher
embittered
me
and
i
reminded
him
rather
brutally
of
ten
shilling
he
had
borrowed
from
me
but
before
he
could
reply
i
regretted
that
i
had
asked
for
it
i
got
ashamed
and
avoided
meeting
his
eyes
and
as
a
lady
came
by
just
then
i
stepped
hastily
aside
to
let
her
pass
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
proceed
on
my
way
what
should
i
do
with
myself
whilst
i
waited
i
could
not
visit
a
cafe
with
empty
pockets
and
i
knew
of
no
acquaintance
that
i
could
call
on
at
this
time
of
day
i
wended
my
way
instinctively
up
town
killed
a
good
deal
of
time
between
the
marketplace
and
the
graendsen
read
the
which
was
newly
posted
up
on
the
board
outside
the
office
took
a
turn
down
carl
johann
wheeled
round
and
went
straight
on
to
our
saviour
cemetery
where
i
found
a
quiet
seat
on
the
slope
near
the
mortuary
chapel
i
sat
there
in
complete
quietness
dozed
in
the
damp
air
mused
and
shivered
and
time
passed
now
was
it
certain
that
the
story
really
was
a
little
masterpiece
of
inspired
art
god
knows
if
it
might
not
have
its
faults
here
and
there
all
things
well
weighed
it
was
not
certain
that
it
would
be
accepted
no
simply
not
even
accepted
it
was
perhaps
mediocre
enough
in
its
way
perhaps
downright
worthless
what
security
had
i
that
it
was
not
already
at
this
moment
lying
in
the
basket
my
confidence
was
shaken
i
sprang
up
and
stormed
out
of
the
graveyard
down
in
akersgaden
i
peeped
into
a
shop
window
and
saw
that
it
was
only
a
little
past
noon
there
was
no
use
in
looking
up
the
editor
before
four
the
fate
of
my
story
filled
me
with
gloomy
forebodings
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
absurd
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
have
written
anything
useable
with
such
suddenness
with
my
brain
full
of
fever
and
dreams
of
course
i
had
deceived
myself
and
been
happy
all
through
the
long
morning
for
nothing
of
course
i
rushed
with
hurried
strides
up
past
han
hill
until
i
came
to
the
open
fields
on
through
the
narrow
quaint
lanes
in
sagene
past
waste
plots
and
small
tilled
fields
and
found
myself
at
last
on
a
country
road
the
end
of
which
i
could
not
see
here
i
halted
and
decided
to
turn
i
was
warm
from
the
walk
and
returned
slowly
and
very
downcast
i
met
two
the
drivers
were
lying
flat
upon
the
top
of
their
loads
and
sang
both
were
and
both
had
round
faces
i
passed
them
and
thought
to
myself
that
they
were
sure
to
accost
me
sure
to
fling
some
taunt
or
other
at
me
play
me
some
trick
and
as
i
got
near
enough
one
of
them
called
out
and
asked
what
i
had
under
my
arm
a
blanket
what
is
it
he
asked
then
i
do
know
rightly
about
three
i
think
whereupon
they
both
laughed
and
drove
on
i
felt
at
the
same
moment
the
lash
of
a
whip
curl
round
one
of
my
ears
and
my
hat
was
jerked
off
they
could
let
me
pass
without
playing
me
a
trick
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
head
more
or
less
confusedly
picked
my
hat
out
of
the
ditch
and
continued
on
my
way
down
at
han
hill
i
met
a
man
who
told
me
it
was
past
four
past
four
already
past
four
i
mended
my
pace
nearly
ran
down
to
the
town
turned
off
towards
the
news
office
perhaps
the
editor
had
been
there
hours
ago
and
had
left
the
office
by
now
i
ran
jostled
against
folk
stumbled
knocked
against
cars
left
everybody
behind
me
competed
with
the
very
horses
struggled
like
a
madman
to
arrive
there
in
time
i
wrenched
through
the
door
took
the
stairs
in
four
bounds
and
knocked
no
answer
he
has
left
he
has
left
i
think
i
try
the
door
which
is
open
knock
once
again
and
enter
the
editor
is
sitting
at
his
table
his
face
towards
the
window
pen
in
hand
about
to
write
when
he
hears
my
breathless
greeting
he
turns
half
round
steals
a
quick
look
at
me
shakes
his
head
and
says
oh
i
have
found
time
to
read
your
sketch
yet
i
am
so
delighted
because
in
that
case
he
has
not
rejected
it
that
i
answer
oh
pray
sir
do
mention
it
i
quite
understand
there
is
no
hurry
in
a
few
days
perhaps
yes
i
shall
see
besides
i
have
your
address
i
forgot
to
inform
him
that
i
no
longer
had
an
address
and
the
interview
is
over
i
bow
myself
out
and
leave
hope
flames
up
again
in
me
as
yet
nothing
is
lost
on
the
contrary
i
might
for
that
matter
yet
win
all
and
my
brain
began
to
spin
a
romance
about
a
great
council
in
heaven
in
which
it
had
just
been
resolved
that
i
should
win
ay
triumphantly
win
ten
shillings
for
a
story
if
i
only
had
some
place
in
which
to
take
refuge
for
the
night
i
consider
where
i
can
stow
myself
away
and
am
so
absorbed
in
this
query
that
i
come
to
a
standstill
in
the
middle
of
the
street
i
forget
where
i
am
and
pose
like
a
solitary
beacon
on
a
rock
in
whilst
the
tides
rush
and
roar
about
it
a
newspaper
boy
offers
me
it
real
good
value
sir
i
look
up
and
start
i
am
outside
semb
shop
again
i
quickly
turn
to
the
holding
the
parcel
in
front
of
me
and
hurry
down
kirkegaden
ashamed
and
afraid
that
any
one
might
have
seen
me
from
the
window
i
pass
by
ingebret
and
the
theatre
turn
round
by
the
and
go
towards
the
sea
near
the
fortress
i
find
a
seat
once
more
and
begin
to
consider
afresh
where
in
the
world
shall
i
find
a
shelter
for
the
night
was
there
a
hole
to
be
found
where
i
could
creep
in
and
hide
myself
till
morning
my
pride
forbade
my
returning
to
my
lodging
besides
it
could
never
really
occur
to
me
to
go
back
on
my
word
i
rejected
this
thought
with
great
scorn
and
i
smiled
superciliously
as
i
thought
of
the
little
red
by
some
association
of
ideas
i
find
myself
suddenly
transported
to
a
large
double
room
i
once
occupied
in
haegdehaugen
i
could
see
a
tray
on
the
table
filled
with
great
slices
of
the
vision
changed
it
was
transformed
into
beef
a
seductive
piece
of
beef
a
napkin
bread
in
plenty
a
silver
fork
the
door
opened
enter
my
landlady
offering
me
more
tea
visions
senseless
dreams
i
tell
myself
that
were
i
to
get
food
now
my
head
would
become
dizzy
once
more
fever
would
fill
my
brain
and
i
would
have
to
fight
again
against
many
mad
fancies
i
could
not
stomach
food
my
inclination
did
not
lie
that
way
that
was
peculiar
to
me
an
idiosyncrasy
of
mine
maybe
as
night
drew
on
a
way
could
be
found
to
procure
shelter
there
was
no
hurry
at
the
worst
i
could
seek
a
place
out
in
the
woods
i
had
the
entire
environs
of
the
city
at
my
disposal
as
yet
there
was
no
degree
of
cold
worth
speaking
of
in
the
weather
and
outside
there
the
sea
rocked
in
drowsy
rest
ships
and
clumsy
prams
ploughed
graves
in
its
bluish
surface
and
scattered
rays
to
the
right
and
left
and
glided
on
whilst
the
smoke
rolled
up
in
downy
masses
from
the
and
the
stroke
of
the
engine
pistons
pierced
the
clammy
air
with
a
dull
sound
there
was
no
sun
and
no
wind
the
trees
behind
me
were
almost
wet
and
the
seat
upon
which
i
sat
was
cold
and
damp
time
went
i
settled
down
to
doze
waxed
tired
and
a
little
shiver
ran
down
my
back
a
while
after
i
felt
that
my
eyelids
began
to
droop
and
i
let
them
droop
when
i
awoke
it
was
dark
all
around
me
i
started
up
bewildered
and
freezing
i
seized
my
parcel
and
commenced
to
walk
i
went
faster
and
faster
in
order
to
get
warm
slapped
my
arms
chafed
my
legs
which
by
now
i
could
hardly
feel
under
me
and
thus
reached
the
of
the
fire
brigade
it
was
nine
i
had
been
asleep
for
several
hours
whatever
shall
i
do
with
myself
i
must
go
to
some
place
i
stand
there
and
stare
up
at
the
and
query
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
succeed
in
getting
into
one
of
the
passages
if
i
were
to
watch
for
a
moment
when
the
watchman
back
was
turned
i
ascend
the
steps
and
prepare
to
open
a
conversation
with
the
man
he
lifts
his
ax
in
salute
and
waits
for
what
i
may
have
to
say
the
uplifted
ax
with
its
edge
turned
against
me
darts
like
a
cold
slash
through
my
nerves
i
stand
dumb
with
terror
before
this
armed
man
and
draw
involuntarily
back
i
say
nothing
only
glide
farther
and
farther
away
from
him
to
save
appearances
i
draw
my
hand
over
my
forehead
as
if
i
had
forgotten
something
or
other
and
slink
away
when
i
reached
the
pavement
i
felt
as
much
saved
as
if
i
had
just
escaped
a
great
peril
and
i
hurried
away
cold
and
famished
more
and
more
miserable
in
spirit
i
flew
up
carl
johann
i
began
to
swear
out
aloud
troubling
myself
not
a
whit
as
to
whether
any
one
heard
me
or
not
arrived
at
parliament
house
just
near
the
first
trees
i
suddenly
by
some
association
of
ideas
bethought
myself
of
a
young
artist
i
knew
a
stripling
i
had
once
saved
from
an
assault
in
the
tivoli
and
upon
whom
i
had
called
later
on
i
snap
my
fingers
gleefully
and
wend
my
way
to
tordenskjiolds
street
find
the
door
on
which
is
fastened
a
card
with
zacharias
bartel
on
it
and
knock
he
came
out
himself
and
smelt
so
fearfully
of
ale
and
tobacco
that
it
was
horrible
i
say
is
that
you
now
why
the
deuce
do
you
come
so
late
it
does
look
at
all
its
best
by
lamplight
i
have
added
a
hayrick
to
it
since
and
have
made
a
few
other
alterations
you
must
see
it
by
daylight
there
is
no
use
our
trying
to
see
it
now
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
now
all
the
same
said
i
though
for
that
matter
i
did
not
in
the
least
remember
what
picture
he
was
talking
about
absolutely
impossible
he
replied
the
whole
thing
will
look
yellow
and
besides
there
another
thing
and
he
came
towards
me
whispering
i
have
a
little
girl
inside
this
evening
so
it
clearly
impracticable
oh
in
that
case
of
course
there
no
question
about
it
i
drew
back
said
and
went
away
so
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
but
to
seek
some
place
out
in
the
woods
if
only
the
fields
were
not
so
damp
i
patted
my
blanket
and
felt
more
and
more
at
home
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
out
i
had
worried
myself
so
long
trying
to
find
a
shelter
in
town
that
i
was
wearied
and
bored
with
the
whole
affair
it
would
be
a
positive
pleasure
to
get
to
rest
to
resign
myself
so
i
loaf
down
the
street
without
thought
in
my
head
at
a
place
in
haegdehaugen
i
halted
outside
a
provision
shop
where
some
food
was
displayed
in
the
window
a
cat
lay
there
and
slept
beside
a
round
french
roll
there
was
a
basin
of
lard
and
several
basins
of
meal
in
the
background
i
stood
a
while
and
gazed
at
these
eatables
but
as
i
had
no
money
wherewith
to
buy
i
turned
quickly
away
and
continued
my
tramp
i
went
very
slowly
passed
by
majorstuen
went
on
always
on
it
seemed
to
me
for
hours
and
came
at
length
at
bogstad
wood
i
turned
off
the
road
here
and
sat
down
to
rest
then
i
began
to
look
about
for
a
place
to
suit
me
to
gather
together
heather
and
juniper
leaves
and
make
up
a
bed
on
a
little
declivity
where
it
was
a
bit
dry
i
opened
the
parcel
and
took
out
the
blanket
i
was
tired
and
exhausted
with
the
long
walk
and
lay
down
at
once
i
turned
and
twisted
many
times
before
i
could
get
settled
my
ear
pained
me
a
little
it
was
slightly
swollen
from
the
and
i
could
not
lie
on
it
i
pulled
off
my
shoes
and
put
them
under
my
head
with
the
paper
from
semb
on
top
and
the
great
spirit
of
darkness
spread
a
shroud
over
me
everything
was
silent
everything
but
up
in
the
heights
soughed
the
everlasting
song
the
voice
of
the
air
the
distant
toneless
humming
which
is
never
silent
i
listened
so
long
to
this
ceaseless
faint
murmur
that
it
began
to
bewilder
me
it
was
surely
a
symphony
from
the
rolling
spheres
above
stars
that
intone
a
song
i
am
damned
if
it
is
though
i
exclaimed
and
i
laughed
aloud
to
collect
my
wits
they
hooting
in
canaan
i
rose
again
pulled
on
my
shoes
and
wandered
about
in
the
gloom
only
to
lay
down
once
more
i
fought
and
wrestled
with
anger
and
fear
until
nearly
dawn
then
fell
asleep
at
last
it
was
broad
daylight
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
going
on
towards
noon
i
pulled
on
my
shoes
packed
up
the
blanket
again
and
set
out
for
town
there
was
no
sun
to
be
seen
today
either
i
shivered
like
a
dog
my
feet
were
benumbed
and
water
commenced
to
run
from
my
eyes
as
if
they
could
not
bear
the
daylight
it
was
three
hunger
began
to
assail
me
downright
in
earnest
i
was
faint
and
now
and
again
i
had
to
retch
furtively
i
swung
round
by
the
dampkökken
footnote
steam
and
famous
cheap
read
the
bill
of
fare
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
a
way
to
attract
attention
as
if
corned
beef
or
salt
port
was
not
meet
food
for
me
after
that
i
went
towards
the
railway
station
a
singular
sense
of
confusion
suddenly
darted
through
my
head
i
stumbled
on
determined
not
to
heed
it
but
i
grew
worse
and
worse
and
was
forced
at
last
to
sit
down
on
a
step
my
whole
being
underwent
a
change
as
if
something
had
slid
aside
in
my
inner
self
or
as
if
a
curtain
or
tissue
of
my
brain
was
rent
in
two
i
was
not
unconscious
i
felt
that
my
ear
was
gathering
a
little
and
as
an
acquaintance
passed
by
i
recognized
him
at
once
and
got
up
and
bowed
what
sore
of
fresh
painful
perception
was
this
that
was
being
added
to
the
rest
was
it
a
consequence
of
sleeping
in
the
sodden
fields
or
did
it
arise
from
my
not
having
had
any
breakfast
yet
looking
the
whole
thing
squarely
in
the
face
there
was
no
meaning
in
living
on
in
this
manner
by
christ
holy
pains
there
was
i
failed
to
see
either
how
i
had
made
myself
deserving
of
this
special
persecution
and
it
suddenly
entered
my
head
that
i
might
just
as
well
turn
rogue
at
once
and
go
to
my
uncle
with
the
blanket
i
could
pawn
it
for
a
shilling
and
get
three
full
meals
and
so
keep
myself
going
until
i
thought
of
something
else
is
true
i
would
have
to
swindle
hans
pauli
i
was
already
on
my
way
to
the
but
stopped
outside
the
door
shook
my
head
irresolutely
then
turned
back
the
farther
away
i
got
the
more
gladsome
ay
delighted
i
became
that
i
had
conquered
this
strong
temptation
the
consciousness
that
i
was
yet
pure
and
honourable
rose
to
my
head
filled
me
with
a
splendid
sense
of
having
principle
character
of
being
a
shining
white
beacon
in
a
muddy
human
sea
amidst
floating
wreck
pawn
another
man
property
for
the
sake
of
a
meal
eat
and
drink
self
to
perdition
brand
one
soul
with
the
first
little
scar
set
the
first
black
mark
against
one
honour
call
one
self
a
blackguard
to
one
own
face
and
needs
must
cast
one
eyes
down
before
one
self
never
never
it
could
never
have
been
my
serious
intention
it
had
really
never
seriously
taken
hold
of
me
in
fact
i
could
not
be
answerable
for
every
loose
fleeting
desultory
thought
particularly
with
such
a
headache
as
i
had
and
nearly
killed
carrying
a
blanket
too
that
belonged
to
another
fellow
there
would
surely
be
some
way
or
another
of
getting
help
when
the
right
time
came
now
there
was
the
grocer
in
groenlandsleret
had
i
importuned
him
every
hour
in
the
day
since
i
sent
in
my
application
had
i
rung
the
bell
early
and
late
and
been
turned
away
why
i
had
not
even
applied
personally
to
him
or
sought
an
answer
it
did
not
follow
surely
that
it
must
needs
be
an
absolutely
vain
attempt
maybe
i
had
luck
with
me
this
time
luck
often
took
such
a
devious
course
and
i
started
for
groenlandsleret
the
last
spasm
that
had
darted
through
my
head
had
exhausted
me
a
little
and
i
walked
very
slowly
and
thought
over
what
i
would
say
to
him
perhaps
he
was
a
good
soul
if
the
whim
seized
him
he
might
pay
me
for
my
work
a
shilling
in
advance
even
without
my
asking
for
it
people
of
that
sort
had
sometimes
the
most
capital
ideas
i
stole
into
a
doorway
and
blackened
the
knees
of
my
trousers
with
spittle
to
try
and
make
them
look
a
little
respectable
left
the
parcel
behind
me
in
a
dark
corner
at
the
back
of
a
chest
and
entered
the
little
shop
a
man
is
standing
pasting
together
bags
made
of
old
newspaper
i
would
like
to
see
christie
i
said
that
me
replied
the
man
indeed
well
my
name
was
i
had
taken
the
liberty
of
sending
him
an
application
i
did
not
know
if
it
had
been
of
any
use
he
repeated
my
name
a
couple
of
times
and
commenced
to
laugh
well
now
you
shall
see
he
said
taking
my
letter
out
of
his
if
you
will
just
be
good
enough
to
see
how
you
deal
with
dates
sir
you
dated
your
letter
and
the
man
roared
with
laughter
yes
that
was
rather
a
mistake
i
said
abashed
a
distraction
a
want
of
thought
i
admitted
it
you
see
i
must
have
a
man
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
makes
no
mistakes
in
figures
said
he
i
regret
it
your
handwriting
is
clear
and
i
like
your
letter
too
but
i
waited
a
while
this
could
not
possibly
be
the
man
final
say
he
busied
himself
again
with
the
bags
yes
it
was
a
pity
i
said
really
an
awful
pity
but
of
course
it
would
not
occur
again
and
after
all
surely
this
little
error
could
not
have
rendered
me
quite
unfit
to
keep
books
no
i
did
say
that
he
answered
but
in
the
meantime
it
had
so
much
weight
with
me
that
i
decided
at
once
upon
another
man
so
the
place
is
filled
yes
a
h
well
then
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
it
no
i
sorry
but
said
fury
welled
up
in
me
blazing
with
brutal
strength
i
fetched
my
parcel
from
the
entry
set
my
teeth
together
jostled
against
the
peaceful
folk
on
the
footpath
and
never
once
asked
their
pardon
as
one
man
stopped
and
set
me
to
rights
rather
sharply
for
my
behaviour
i
turned
round
and
screamed
a
single
meaningless
word
in
his
ear
clenched
my
fist
right
under
his
nose
and
stumbled
on
hardened
by
a
blind
rage
that
i
could
not
control
he
called
a
policeman
and
i
desired
nothing
better
than
to
have
one
between
my
hands
just
for
one
moment
i
slackened
my
pace
intentionally
in
order
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
overtaking
me
but
he
did
not
come
was
there
now
any
reason
whatever
that
absolutely
every
one
of
one
most
earnest
and
most
persevering
efforts
should
fail
why
too
had
i
written
in
what
way
did
that
infernal
date
concern
me
here
i
was
going
about
starving
so
that
my
entrails
wriggle
together
in
me
like
worms
and
it
was
as
far
as
i
knew
not
decreed
in
the
book
of
fate
that
anything
in
the
shape
of
food
would
turn
up
later
on
in
the
day
i
was
becoming
mentally
and
physically
more
and
more
prostrate
i
was
letting
myself
down
each
day
to
less
and
less
honest
actions
so
that
i
lied
on
each
day
without
blushing
cheated
poor
people
out
of
their
rent
struggled
with
the
meanest
thoughts
of
making
away
with
other
men
blankets
all
without
remorse
or
prick
of
conscience
foul
places
began
to
gather
in
my
inner
being
black
spores
which
spread
more
and
more
and
up
in
heaven
god
almighty
sat
and
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
me
and
took
heed
that
destruction
proceeded
in
accordance
with
all
the
rules
of
art
uniformly
and
gradually
without
a
break
in
the
measure
but
in
the
abysses
of
hell
the
angriest
devils
bristled
with
range
because
it
lasted
such
a
long
time
until
i
committed
a
mortal
sin
an
unpardonable
offence
for
which
god
in
his
justice
must
cast
me
down
i
quickened
my
pace
hurried
faster
and
faster
turned
suddenly
to
the
left
and
found
myself
excited
and
angry
in
a
light
ornate
doorway
i
did
not
pause
not
for
one
second
but
the
whole
peculiar
ornamentation
of
the
entrance
struck
on
my
perception
in
a
flash
every
detail
of
the
decoration
and
the
tiling
of
the
floor
stood
clear
on
my
mental
vision
as
i
sprang
up
the
stairs
i
rang
violently
on
the
second
floor
why
should
i
stop
exactly
on
the
second
floor
and
why
just
seize
hold
of
this
bell
which
was
some
little
way
from
the
stairs
a
young
lady
in
a
grey
gown
with
black
trimming
came
out
and
opened
the
door
she
looked
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
at
me
then
shook
her
head
and
said
no
we
have
not
got
anything
today
and
she
made
a
feint
to
close
the
door
what
induced
me
to
thrust
myself
in
this
creature
way
she
took
me
without
further
ado
for
a
beggar
i
got
cool
and
collected
at
once
i
raised
my
hat
made
a
respectful
bow
and
as
if
i
had
not
caught
her
words
said
with
the
utmost
politeness
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
madam
for
ringing
so
hard
the
bell
was
new
to
me
is
it
not
here
that
an
invalid
gentleman
lives
who
has
advertised
for
a
man
to
wheel
him
about
in
a
chair
she
stood
awhile
and
digested
this
mendacious
invention
and
seemed
to
be
irresolute
in
her
summing
up
of
my
person
no
she
said
at
length
no
there
is
no
invalid
gentleman
living
here
not
really
an
elderly
gentleman
two
hours
a
day
sixpence
an
hour
no
ah
in
that
case
i
again
ask
pardon
said
i
it
is
perhaps
on
the
first
floor
i
only
wanted
in
any
case
to
recommend
a
man
i
know
in
whom
i
am
interested
my
name
is
footnote
the
last
family
bearing
title
of
nobility
in
norway
and
i
bowed
again
and
drew
back
the
young
lady
blushed
crimson
and
in
her
embarrassment
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
but
stood
and
stared
after
me
as
i
descended
the
stairs
my
calm
had
returned
to
me
and
my
head
was
clear
the
lady
saying
that
she
had
nothing
for
me
today
had
acted
upon
me
like
an
icy
shower
so
it
had
gone
so
far
with
me
that
any
one
might
point
at
me
and
say
to
himself
there
goes
a
beggar
one
of
those
people
who
get
their
food
handed
out
to
them
at
folk
i
halted
outside
an
in
möller
street
and
sniffed
the
fresh
smell
of
meat
roasting
inside
my
hand
was
already
upon
the
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
entering
without
any
fixed
purpose
when
i
bethought
myself
in
time
and
left
the
spot
on
reaching
the
market
and
seeking
for
a
place
to
rest
for
a
little
i
found
all
the
benches
occupied
and
i
sought
in
vain
all
round
outside
the
church
for
a
quiet
seat
where
i
could
sit
down
naturally
i
told
myself
gloomily
naturally
naturally
and
i
commenced
to
walk
again
i
took
a
turn
round
the
fountain
at
the
corner
of
the
bazaar
and
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
water
on
again
dragging
one
foot
after
the
other
stopped
for
a
long
time
before
each
shop
window
halted
and
watched
every
vehicle
that
drove
by
i
felt
a
scorching
heat
in
my
head
and
something
pulsated
strangely
in
my
temples
the
water
i
had
drunk
disagreed
with
me
fearfully
and
i
retched
stopping
here
and
there
to
escape
being
noticed
in
the
open
street
in
this
manner
i
came
up
to
our
saviour
cemetery
i
sat
down
here
with
my
elbows
on
my
knees
and
my
head
in
my
hands
in
this
cramped
position
i
was
more
at
ease
and
i
no
longer
felt
the
little
gnawing
in
my
chest
a
lay
on
his
stomach
on
a
large
slab
of
granite
at
the
side
of
me
and
cut
inscriptions
he
had
blue
spectacles
on
and
reminded
me
of
an
acquaintance
of
mine
whom
i
had
almost
forgotten
if
i
could
only
knock
all
shame
on
the
head
and
apply
to
him
tell
him
the
truth
right
out
that
things
were
getting
awfully
tight
with
me
now
ay
that
i
found
it
hard
enough
to
keep
alive
i
could
give
him
my
zounds
my
tickets
for
nearly
a
shilling
i
search
nervously
for
this
precious
treasure
as
i
do
not
find
them
quickly
enough
i
spring
to
my
feet
and
search
in
a
sweat
of
fear
i
discover
them
at
last
in
the
bottom
of
my
together
with
other
papers
some
clean
some
written
on
of
no
value
i
count
these
six
tickets
over
many
times
backwards
and
forwards
i
had
not
much
use
for
them
it
might
pass
for
a
whim
a
notion
of
mine
that
i
no
longer
cared
to
get
shaved
i
was
saved
to
the
extent
of
sixpence
a
white
sixpence
of
kongsberg
silver
the
bank
closed
at
six
i
could
watch
for
my
man
outside
the
opland
café
between
seven
and
eight
i
sat
and
was
for
a
long
time
pleased
with
this
thought
time
went
the
wind
blew
lustily
through
the
chestnut
trees
around
me
and
the
day
declined
after
all
was
it
not
rather
petty
to
come
slinking
up
with
six
to
a
young
gentleman
holding
a
good
position
in
a
bank
perhaps
he
had
already
a
book
maybe
two
quite
full
of
spick
and
span
tickets
a
contrast
to
the
crumpled
ones
i
held
who
could
tell
i
felt
in
all
my
pockets
for
anything
else
i
could
let
go
with
them
but
found
nothing
if
i
could
only
offer
him
my
tie
i
could
well
do
without
it
if
i
buttoned
my
coat
tightly
up
which
by
the
way
i
was
already
obliged
to
do
as
i
had
no
waistcoat
i
untied
it
it
was
a
large
overlapping
bow
which
hid
half
my
chest
brushed
it
carefully
and
folded
it
up
in
a
piece
of
clean
white
together
with
the
tickets
then
i
left
the
churchyard
and
took
the
road
leading
to
the
opland
it
was
seven
by
the
town
hall
clock
i
walked
up
and
down
hard
by
the
café
kept
close
to
the
iron
railings
and
kept
a
sharp
watch
on
all
who
went
in
and
came
out
of
the
door
at
last
about
eight
i
saw
the
young
fellow
fresh
elegantly
dressed
coming
up
the
hill
and
across
to
the
cafe
door
my
heart
fluttered
like
a
little
bird
in
my
breast
as
i
caught
sight
of
him
and
i
blurted
out
without
even
a
greeting
sixpence
old
friend
i
said
putting
on
cheek
here
is
the
worth
of
it
and
i
thrust
the
little
packet
into
his
hand
have
got
it
he
exclaimed
god
knows
if
i
have
and
he
turned
his
purse
inside
out
right
before
my
eyes
i
was
out
last
night
and
got
totally
cleared
out
you
must
believe
me
i
literally
have
got
it
no
no
my
dear
fellow
i
suppose
it
is
so
i
answered
and
i
took
his
word
for
it
there
was
indeed
no
reason
why
he
should
lie
about
such
a
trifling
matter
it
struck
me
too
that
his
blue
eyes
were
moist
whilst
he
ransacked
his
pockets
and
found
nothing
i
drew
back
excuse
me
i
said
it
was
only
just
that
i
was
a
bit
hard
up
i
was
already
a
piece
down
the
street
when
he
called
after
me
about
the
little
packet
keep
it
keep
it
i
answered
you
are
welcome
to
it
there
are
only
a
few
trifles
in
it
a
bagatelle
about
all
i
own
in
the
world
and
i
became
so
touched
at
my
own
words
they
sounded
so
pathetic
in
the
twilight
that
i
fell
the
wind
freshened
the
clouds
chased
madly
across
the
heavens
and
it
grew
cooler
and
cooler
as
it
got
darker
i
walked
and
cried
as
i
walked
down
the
whole
street
felt
more
and
more
commiseration
with
myself
and
repeated
time
after
time
a
few
words
an
ejaculation
which
called
forth
fresh
tears
whenever
they
were
on
the
point
of
ceasing
lord
god
i
feel
so
wretched
lord
god
i
feel
so
wretched
an
hour
passed
passed
with
such
strange
slowness
such
weariness
i
spent
a
long
time
in
market
street
sat
on
steps
stole
into
doorways
and
when
any
one
approached
stood
and
stared
absently
into
the
shops
where
people
bustled
about
with
wares
or
money
at
last
i
found
myself
a
sheltered
place
behind
a
deal
hoarding
between
the
church
and
the
bazaar
no
i
could
go
out
into
the
woods
again
this
evening
things
must
take
their
course
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
go
and
it
was
such
an
endless
way
there
i
would
kill
the
night
as
best
i
could
and
remain
where
i
was
if
it
got
all
too
cold
well
i
could
walk
round
the
church
i
would
not
in
any
case
worry
myself
any
more
about
that
and
i
leant
back
and
dozed
the
noise
around
me
diminished
the
shops
closed
the
steps
of
the
pedestrians
sounded
more
and
more
rarely
and
in
all
the
windows
about
the
lights
went
out
i
opened
my
eyes
and
became
aware
of
a
figure
standing
in
front
of
me
the
flash
of
shining
buttons
told
me
it
was
a
policeman
though
i
could
not
see
the
man
face
he
said
i
answered
and
got
afraid
where
do
you
live
he
queried
i
name
from
habit
and
without
thought
my
old
address
the
little
attic
he
stood
for
a
while
have
i
done
anything
wrong
i
asked
anxiously
no
not
at
all
he
replied
but
you
had
perhaps
better
be
getting
home
now
it
cold
lying
here
ay
that
true
i
feel
it
is
a
little
chilly
i
said
and
instinctively
took
the
road
to
my
old
abode
if
i
only
set
about
it
carefully
i
might
be
able
to
get
upstairs
without
being
heard
there
were
eight
steps
in
all
and
only
the
two
top
ones
creaked
under
my
tread
down
at
the
door
i
took
off
my
shoes
and
ascended
it
was
quiet
everywhere
i
could
hear
the
slow
of
a
clock
and
a
child
crying
a
little
after
that
i
heard
nothing
i
found
my
door
lifted
the
latch
as
i
was
accustomed
to
do
entered
the
room
and
shut
the
door
noiselessly
after
me
everything
was
as
i
had
left
it
the
curtains
were
pulled
aside
from
the
windows
and
the
bed
stood
empty
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
note
lying
on
the
table
perhaps
it
was
my
note
to
the
landlady
she
might
never
have
been
up
here
since
i
went
away
i
fumbled
with
my
hands
over
the
white
spot
and
felt
to
my
astonishment
that
it
was
a
letter
i
take
it
over
to
the
window
examine
as
well
as
it
is
possible
in
the
dark
the
letters
of
the
address
and
make
out
at
least
my
own
name
ah
i
thought
an
answer
from
my
landlady
forbidding
me
to
enter
the
room
again
if
i
were
for
sneaking
back
slowly
quite
slowly
i
left
the
room
carrying
my
shoes
in
one
hand
the
letter
in
the
other
and
the
blanket
under
my
arm
i
draw
myself
up
set
my
teeth
as
i
tread
on
the
creaking
steps
get
happily
down
the
stairs
and
stand
once
more
at
the
door
i
put
on
my
shoes
take
my
time
with
the
laces
sit
a
while
quietly
after
i
ready
and
stare
vacantly
before
me
holding
the
letter
in
my
hand
then
i
get
up
and
go
the
flickering
ray
of
a
gas
lamp
gleams
up
the
street
i
make
straight
for
the
light
lean
my
parcel
against
the
and
open
the
letter
all
this
with
the
utmost
deliberation
a
stream
of
light
as
it
were
darts
through
my
breast
and
i
hear
that
i
give
a
little
cry
a
meaningless
sound
of
joy
the
letter
was
from
the
editor
my
story
was
accepted
had
been
set
in
type
immediately
straight
off
a
few
slight
alterations
a
couple
of
errors
in
writing
amended
worked
out
with
talent
be
printed
tomorrow
i
laughed
and
cried
took
to
jumping
and
running
down
the
street
stopped
slapped
my
thighs
swore
loudly
and
solemnly
into
space
at
nothing
in
particular
and
time
went
all
through
the
night
until
the
bright
dawn
i
jodled
about
the
streets
and
repeated
worked
out
with
talent
therefore
a
little
masterpiece
a
stroke
of
genius
and
part
ii
a
few
weeks
later
i
was
out
one
evening
once
more
i
had
sat
out
in
a
churchyard
and
worked
at
an
article
for
one
of
the
newspapers
but
whilst
i
was
struggling
with
it
eight
struck
and
darkness
closed
in
and
time
for
shutting
the
gates
i
was
hungry
very
hungry
the
ten
shillings
had
worse
luck
lasted
all
too
short
it
was
now
two
ay
nearly
three
days
since
i
had
eaten
anything
and
i
felt
somewhat
faint
holding
the
pencil
even
had
taxed
me
a
little
i
had
half
a
penknife
and
a
bunch
of
keys
in
my
pocket
but
not
a
farthing
when
the
churchyard
gate
shut
i
meant
to
have
gone
straight
home
but
from
an
instinctive
dread
of
my
room
a
vacant
tinker
workshop
where
all
was
dark
and
barren
and
which
in
fact
i
had
got
permission
to
occupy
for
the
present
i
stumbled
on
passed
not
caring
where
i
went
the
town
hall
right
to
the
sea
and
over
to
a
seat
near
the
railway
bridge
at
this
moment
not
a
sad
thought
troubled
me
i
forgot
my
distress
and
felt
calmed
by
the
view
of
the
sea
which
lay
peaceful
and
lovely
in
the
murkiness
for
old
habit
sake
i
would
please
myself
by
reading
through
the
bit
i
had
just
written
and
which
seemed
to
my
suffering
head
the
best
thing
i
had
ever
done
i
took
my
manuscript
out
of
my
pocket
to
try
and
decipher
it
held
it
close
up
to
my
eyes
and
ran
through
it
one
line
after
the
other
at
last
i
got
tired
and
put
the
papers
back
in
my
pocket
everything
was
still
the
sea
stretched
away
in
pearly
blueness
and
little
birds
flitted
noiselessly
by
me
from
place
to
place
a
policeman
patrols
in
the
distance
otherwise
there
is
not
a
soul
visible
and
the
whole
harbour
is
hushed
in
quiet
i
count
my
belongings
once
more
half
a
penknife
a
bunch
of
keys
but
not
a
farthing
suddenly
i
dive
into
my
pocket
and
take
the
papers
out
again
it
was
a
mechanical
movement
an
unconscious
nervous
twitch
i
selected
a
white
unwritten
page
and
god
knows
where
i
got
the
notion
from
but
i
made
a
cornet
closed
it
carefully
so
that
it
looked
as
if
it
were
filled
with
something
and
threw
it
far
out
on
to
the
pavement
the
breeze
blew
it
onward
a
little
and
then
it
lay
still
by
this
time
hunger
had
begun
to
assail
me
in
earnest
i
sat
and
looked
at
the
white
paper
cornet
which
seemed
as
if
it
might
be
bursting
with
shining
silver
pieces
and
incited
myself
to
believe
that
it
really
did
contain
something
i
sat
and
coaxed
myself
quite
audibly
to
guess
the
sum
if
i
guessed
aright
it
was
to
be
mine
i
imagined
the
tiny
pretty
penny
bits
at
the
bottom
and
the
thick
fluted
shillings
on
top
a
whole
paper
cornet
full
of
money
i
sat
and
gazed
at
it
with
wide
opened
eyes
and
urged
myself
to
go
and
steal
it
then
i
hear
the
constable
cough
what
puts
it
into
my
head
to
do
the
same
i
rise
up
from
the
seat
and
repeat
the
cough
three
times
so
that
he
may
hear
it
wo
he
jump
at
the
corner
when
he
comes
i
sat
and
laughed
at
this
trick
rubbed
my
hands
with
glee
and
swore
with
rollicking
recklessness
what
a
disappointment
he
will
get
the
dog
would
this
piece
of
villainy
make
him
inclined
to
sink
into
hottest
pool
of
torment
i
was
drunk
with
starvation
my
hunger
had
made
me
tipsy
a
few
minutes
later
the
policeman
comes
by
clinking
his
iron
heels
on
the
pavement
peering
on
all
sides
he
takes
his
time
he
has
the
whole
night
before
him
he
does
not
notice
the
paper
bag
not
till
he
comes
quite
close
to
it
then
he
stops
and
stares
at
it
it
looks
so
white
and
so
full
as
it
lies
there
perhaps
a
little
sum
what
a
little
sum
of
silver
money
and
he
picks
it
up
hum
it
is
light
very
light
maybe
an
expensive
feather
some
hat
trimming
he
opened
it
carefully
with
his
big
hands
and
looked
in
i
laughed
laughed
slapped
my
thighs
and
laughed
like
a
maniac
and
not
a
sound
issued
from
my
throat
my
laughter
was
hushed
and
feverish
to
the
intensity
of
tears
clink
clink
again
over
the
and
the
policeman
took
a
turn
towards
the
i
sat
there
with
tears
in
my
eyes
and
hiccoughed
for
breath
quite
beside
myself
with
feverish
merriment
i
commenced
to
talk
aloud
to
myself
all
about
the
cornet
imitated
the
poor
policeman
movements
peeped
into
my
hollow
hand
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
to
myself
he
coughed
as
he
threw
it
away
he
coughed
as
he
threw
it
away
i
added
new
words
to
these
gave
them
additional
point
changed
the
whole
sentence
and
made
it
catching
and
piquant
he
coughed
once
kheu
heu
i
exhausted
myself
in
weaving
variations
on
these
words
and
the
evening
was
far
advanced
before
my
mirth
ceased
then
a
drowsy
quiet
overcame
me
a
pleasant
languor
which
i
did
not
attempt
to
resist
the
darkness
had
intensified
and
a
slight
breeze
furrowed
the
sea
the
ships
the
masts
of
which
i
could
see
outlined
against
the
sky
looked
with
their
black
hulls
like
voiceless
monsters
that
bristled
and
lay
in
wait
for
me
i
had
no
pain
my
hunger
had
taken
the
edge
off
it
in
its
stead
i
felt
pleasantly
empty
untouched
by
everything
around
me
and
glad
not
to
be
noticed
by
any
one
i
put
my
feet
up
on
the
seat
and
leant
back
thus
i
could
best
appreciate
the
of
perfect
isolation
there
was
not
a
cloud
on
my
mind
not
a
feeling
of
discomfort
and
so
far
as
my
thought
reached
i
had
not
a
whim
not
a
desire
unsatisfied
i
lay
with
open
eyes
in
a
state
of
utter
absence
of
mind
i
felt
myself
charmed
away
moreover
not
a
sound
disturbed
me
soft
darkness
had
hidden
the
whole
world
from
my
sight
and
buried
me
in
ideal
rest
only
the
lonely
crooning
voice
of
silence
strikes
in
monotones
on
my
ear
and
the
dark
monsters
out
there
will
draw
me
to
them
when
night
comes
and
they
will
bear
me
far
across
the
sea
through
strange
lands
where
no
man
dwells
and
they
will
bear
me
to
princess
ylajali
palace
where
an
grandeur
awaits
me
greater
than
that
of
any
other
man
and
she
herself
will
be
sitting
in
a
dazzling
hall
where
all
is
amethyst
on
a
throne
of
yellow
roses
and
will
stretch
out
her
hands
to
me
when
i
alight
will
smile
and
call
as
i
approach
and
kneel
welcome
welcome
knight
to
me
and
my
land
i
have
waited
twenty
summers
for
you
and
called
for
you
on
all
bright
nights
and
when
you
sorrowed
i
have
wept
here
and
when
you
slept
i
have
breathed
sweet
dreams
in
you
and
the
fair
one
clasps
my
hand
and
holding
it
leads
me
through
long
corridors
where
great
crowds
of
people
cry
hurrah
through
bright
gardens
where
three
hundred
tender
maidens
laugh
and
play
and
through
another
hall
where
all
is
of
emerald
and
here
the
sun
shines
in
the
corridors
and
galleries
choirs
of
musicians
march
by
and
rills
of
perfume
are
wafted
towards
me
i
clasp
her
hand
in
mine
i
feel
the
wild
witchery
of
enchantment
shiver
through
my
blood
and
i
fold
my
arms
around
her
and
she
whispers
not
here
come
yet
farther
and
we
enter
a
crimson
room
where
all
is
of
ruby
a
foaming
glory
in
which
i
faint
then
i
feel
her
arms
encircle
me
her
breath
fans
my
face
with
a
whispered
welcome
loved
one
kiss
me
more
more
i
see
from
my
seat
stars
shooting
before
my
eyes
and
my
thoughts
are
swept
away
in
a
hurricane
of
light
i
had
fallen
asleep
where
i
lay
and
was
awakened
by
the
policeman
there
i
sat
recalled
mercilessly
to
life
and
misery
my
first
feeling
was
of
stupid
amazement
at
finding
myself
in
the
open
air
but
this
was
quickly
replaced
by
a
bitter
despondency
i
was
near
crying
with
sorrow
at
being
still
alive
it
had
rained
whilst
i
slept
and
my
clothes
were
soaked
through
and
through
and
i
felt
a
damp
cold
in
my
limbs
the
darkness
was
denser
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
distinguish
the
policeman
face
in
front
of
me
so
that
right
he
said
get
up
now
i
got
up
at
once
if
he
had
commanded
me
to
lie
down
again
i
would
have
obeyed
too
i
was
fearfully
dejected
and
utterly
without
strength
added
to
that
i
was
almost
instantly
aware
of
the
pangs
of
hunger
again
hold
on
there
the
policeman
shouted
after
me
why
you
walking
off
without
your
hat
you
juggins
so
h
there
now
go
on
i
indeed
thought
there
was
something
something
i
had
forgotten
i
stammered
absently
thanks
and
i
stumbled
away
if
one
only
had
a
little
bread
to
eat
one
of
those
delicious
little
brown
loaves
that
one
could
bite
into
as
one
walked
along
the
street
and
as
i
went
on
i
thought
over
the
particular
sort
of
brown
bread
that
would
be
so
unspeakably
good
to
munch
i
was
bitterly
hungry
wished
myself
dead
and
buried
i
got
maudlin
and
wept
there
never
was
any
end
to
my
misery
suddenly
i
stopped
in
the
street
stamped
on
the
pavement
and
cursed
loudly
what
was
it
he
called
me
a
juggins
i
would
just
show
him
what
calling
me
a
juggins
means
i
turned
round
and
ran
back
i
felt
with
anger
down
the
street
i
stumbled
and
fell
but
i
paid
no
heed
to
it
jumped
up
again
and
ran
on
but
by
the
time
i
reached
the
railway
station
i
had
become
so
tired
that
i
did
not
feel
able
to
proceed
all
the
way
to
the
besides
my
anger
had
cooled
down
with
the
run
at
length
i
pulled
up
and
drew
breath
was
it
not
after
all
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
what
such
a
policeman
said
yes
but
one
stand
everything
right
enough
i
interrupted
myself
but
he
knew
no
better
and
i
found
this
argument
satisfactory
i
repeated
twice
to
myself
he
knew
no
better
and
with
that
i
returned
again
good
lord
thought
i
wrathfully
what
things
you
do
take
into
your
head
running
about
like
a
madman
through
the
soaking
wet
streets
on
dark
nights
my
hunger
was
now
tormenting
me
excruciatingly
and
gave
me
no
rest
again
and
again
i
swallowed
saliva
to
try
and
satisfy
myself
a
little
i
fancied
it
helped
i
had
been
pinched
too
for
food
for
ever
so
many
weeks
before
this
last
period
set
in
and
my
strength
had
diminished
considerably
of
late
when
i
had
been
lucky
enough
to
raise
five
shillings
by
some
manoeuvre
or
another
they
only
lasted
any
time
with
difficulty
not
long
enough
for
me
to
be
restored
to
health
before
a
new
hunger
period
set
in
and
reduced
me
again
my
back
and
shoulders
caused
me
the
worst
trouble
i
could
stop
the
little
gnawing
i
had
in
my
chest
by
coughing
hard
or
bending
well
forward
as
i
walked
but
i
had
no
remedy
for
back
and
shoulders
whatever
was
the
reason
that
things
would
not
brighten
up
for
me
was
i
not
just
as
much
entitled
to
live
as
any
one
else
for
example
as
bookseller
pascha
or
steam
agent
hennechen
had
i
not
two
shoulders
like
a
giant
and
two
strong
hands
to
work
with
and
had
i
not
in
sooth
even
applied
for
a
place
as
in
möllergaden
in
order
to
earn
my
daily
bread
was
i
lazy
had
i
not
applied
for
situations
attended
lectures
written
articles
and
worked
day
and
night
like
a
man
possessed
had
i
not
lived
like
a
miser
eaten
bread
and
milk
when
i
had
plenty
bread
alone
when
i
had
little
and
starved
when
i
had
nothing
did
i
live
in
an
hotel
had
i
a
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
why
i
am
living
in
a
loft
over
a
tinker
workshop
a
loft
already
forsaken
by
god
and
man
last
winter
because
the
snow
blew
in
so
i
could
not
understand
the
whole
thing
not
a
bit
of
it
i
slouched
on
and
dwelt
upon
all
this
and
there
was
not
as
much
as
a
spark
of
bitterness
or
malice
or
envy
in
my
mind
i
halted
at
a
and
gazed
into
the
window
i
tried
to
read
the
labels
on
a
couple
of
the
tins
but
it
was
too
dark
vexed
with
myself
over
this
new
whim
and
excited
almost
angry
at
not
being
able
to
make
out
what
these
tins
held
i
rapped
twice
sharply
on
the
window
and
went
on
up
the
street
i
saw
a
policeman
i
quickened
my
pace
went
close
up
to
him
and
said
without
the
slightest
provocation
it
is
ten
no
it
two
he
answered
amazed
no
it
ten
i
persisted
it
is
ten
and
groaning
with
anger
i
stepped
yet
a
pace
or
two
nearer
clenched
my
fist
and
said
listen
do
you
know
what
it
ten
he
stood
and
considered
a
while
summed
up
my
appearance
stared
aghast
at
me
and
at
last
said
quite
gently
in
any
case
it
about
time
ye
were
getting
home
would
ye
like
me
to
go
with
ye
a
bit
i
was
completely
disarmed
by
this
man
unexpected
friendliness
i
felt
that
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
and
i
hastened
to
reply
no
thank
you
i
have
only
been
out
a
little
too
late
in
a
café
thank
you
very
much
all
the
same
he
saluted
with
his
hand
to
his
helmet
as
i
turned
away
his
friendliness
had
overwhelmed
me
and
i
cried
weakly
because
i
had
not
even
a
little
coin
to
give
him
i
halted
and
looked
after
him
as
he
went
slowly
on
his
way
i
struck
my
forehead
and
in
measure
as
he
disappeared
from
my
sight
i
cried
more
violently
i
railed
at
myself
for
my
poverty
called
myself
abusive
names
invented
furious
designations
rich
rough
nuggets
in
a
vein
of
abuse
with
which
i
overwhelmed
myself
i
kept
on
at
this
until
i
was
nearly
home
on
coming
to
the
door
i
discovered
i
had
dropped
my
keys
oh
of
course
i
muttered
to
myself
why
should
i
lose
my
keys
here
i
am
living
in
a
yard
where
there
is
a
stable
underneath
and
a
tinker
workshop
up
above
the
door
is
locked
at
night
and
no
one
no
one
can
open
it
therefore
why
should
i
not
lose
my
keys
i
am
as
wet
as
a
dog
a
little
hungry
ah
just
ever
such
a
little
hungry
and
slightly
ay
absurdly
tired
about
my
knees
therefore
why
should
i
not
lose
them
why
for
that
matter
had
not
the
whole
house
flitted
out
to
aker
by
the
time
i
came
home
and
wished
to
enter
it
and
i
laughed
to
myself
hardened
by
hunger
and
exhaustion
i
could
hear
the
horses
stamp
in
the
stables
and
i
could
see
my
window
above
but
i
could
not
open
the
door
and
i
could
not
get
in
it
had
begun
to
rain
again
and
i
felt
the
water
soak
through
to
my
shoulders
at
the
town
hall
i
was
seized
by
a
bright
idea
i
would
ask
the
policeman
to
open
the
door
i
applied
at
once
to
a
constable
and
earnestly
begged
him
to
accompany
me
and
let
me
in
if
he
could
yes
if
he
could
yes
but
he
could
he
had
no
key
the
police
keys
were
not
there
they
were
kept
in
the
detective
department
what
was
i
to
do
then
well
i
could
go
to
an
hotel
and
get
a
bed
but
i
really
could
go
to
an
hotel
and
get
a
bed
i
had
not
money
i
had
been
out
in
a
café
he
knew
we
stood
a
while
on
the
town
hall
steps
he
considered
and
examined
my
personal
appearance
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
outside
well
then
you
must
go
to
the
and
report
yourself
as
homeless
said
he
homeless
i
had
thought
of
that
yes
by
jove
that
was
a
capital
idea
and
i
thanked
the
constable
on
the
spot
for
the
suggestion
could
i
simply
go
in
and
say
i
was
homeless
just
your
name
inquired
the
guard
tangen
andreas
tangen
i
do
know
why
i
lied
my
thoughts
fluttered
about
disconnectedly
and
inspired
me
with
many
singular
whims
more
than
i
knew
what
to
do
with
i
hit
upon
this
name
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
blurted
it
out
without
any
calculation
i
lied
without
any
occasion
for
doing
so
occupation
this
was
driving
me
into
a
corner
with
a
vengeance
occupation
what
was
my
occupation
i
thought
first
of
turning
myself
into
a
tinker
but
i
dared
not
firstly
i
had
given
myself
a
name
that
was
not
common
to
every
and
any
tinker
besides
i
wore
it
suddenly
entered
my
head
to
be
foolhardy
i
took
a
step
forward
and
said
firmly
almost
solemnly
a
journalist
the
guard
gave
a
start
before
he
wrote
it
down
whilst
i
stood
as
important
as
a
homeless
cabinet
minister
before
the
barrier
it
roused
no
suspicions
the
guard
understood
quite
well
why
i
hesitated
a
little
before
answering
what
did
it
look
like
to
see
a
journalist
in
the
night
without
a
roof
over
his
head
on
what
paper
herr
tangen
said
i
i
have
been
out
a
little
too
late
this
evening
more
the
shame
oh
we
wo
mention
that
he
interrupted
with
a
smile
when
young
people
are
out
we
understand
turning
to
a
policeman
he
said
as
he
rose
and
bowed
politely
to
me
show
this
gentleman
up
to
the
reserved
section
i
felt
ice
run
down
my
back
at
my
own
boldness
and
i
clenched
my
hands
to
steady
myself
a
bit
if
i
only
had
dragged
in
the
i
knew
friele
could
show
his
teeth
when
he
liked
and
i
was
reminded
of
that
by
the
grinding
of
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
the
gas
will
burn
for
ten
minutes
remarked
the
policeman
at
the
door
and
then
does
it
go
out
then
it
goes
out
i
sat
on
the
bed
and
listened
to
the
turning
of
the
key
the
bright
cell
had
a
friendly
air
i
felt
comfortably
and
well
sheltered
and
listened
with
pleasure
to
the
rain
outside
i
could
wish
myself
anything
better
than
such
a
cosy
cell
my
contentment
increased
sitting
on
the
bed
hat
in
hand
and
with
eyes
fastened
on
the
gas
jet
over
in
the
wall
i
gave
myself
up
to
thinking
over
the
minutes
of
my
first
interview
with
the
police
this
was
the
first
time
and
how
had
i
fooled
them
journalist
tangen
if
you
please
and
then
did
i
appeal
straight
to
his
heart
with
we
wo
mention
that
eh
sat
in
state
in
the
stiftsgaarden
till
two
forgot
and
a
with
a
thousand
kroner
at
home
show
this
gentleman
up
to
the
reserved
section
all
at
once
out
goes
the
gas
with
a
strange
suddenness
without
diminishing
or
flickering
i
sit
in
the
deepest
darkness
i
can
not
see
my
hand
nor
the
white
walls
nothing
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
bed
and
i
undressed
but
i
was
not
tired
from
want
of
sleep
and
it
would
not
come
to
me
i
lay
a
while
gazing
into
the
darkness
this
dense
mass
of
gloom
that
had
no
bottom
my
thoughts
could
not
fathom
it
it
seemed
beyond
all
measure
dense
to
me
and
i
felt
its
presence
oppress
me
i
closed
my
eyes
commenced
to
sing
under
my
breath
and
tossed
to
and
fro
in
order
to
distract
myself
but
to
no
purpose
the
darkness
had
taken
possession
of
my
thoughts
and
left
me
not
a
moment
in
peace
supposing
i
were
myself
to
be
absorbed
in
darkness
made
one
with
it
i
raise
myself
up
in
bed
and
fling
out
my
arms
my
nervous
condition
has
got
the
upper
hand
of
me
and
nothing
availed
no
matter
how
much
i
tried
to
work
against
it
there
i
sat
a
prey
to
the
most
singular
fantasies
listening
to
myself
crooning
lullabies
sweating
with
the
exertion
of
striving
to
hush
myself
to
rest
i
peered
into
the
gloom
and
i
never
in
all
the
days
of
my
life
felt
such
darkness
there
was
no
doubt
that
i
found
myself
here
in
face
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
darkness
a
desperate
element
to
which
no
one
had
hitherto
paid
attention
the
most
ludicrous
thoughts
busied
me
and
everything
made
me
afraid
a
little
hole
in
the
wall
at
the
head
of
my
bed
occupies
me
greatly
a
nail
hole
i
find
the
marks
in
the
wall
i
feel
it
blow
into
it
and
try
to
guess
its
depth
that
was
no
innocent
hole
not
at
all
it
was
a
downright
intricate
and
mysterious
hole
which
i
must
guard
against
possessed
by
the
thought
of
this
hole
entirely
beside
myself
with
curiosity
and
fear
i
get
out
of
bed
and
seize
hold
of
my
penknife
in
order
to
gauge
its
depth
and
convince
myself
that
it
does
not
reach
right
into
the
next
wall
i
lay
down
once
more
to
try
and
fall
asleep
but
in
reality
to
wrestle
again
with
the
darkness
the
rain
had
ceased
outside
and
i
could
not
hear
a
sound
i
continued
for
a
long
time
to
listen
for
footsteps
in
the
street
and
got
no
peace
until
i
heard
a
pedestrian
go
by
to
judge
from
the
sound
a
constable
suddenly
i
snap
my
fingers
many
times
and
laugh
that
was
the
very
deuce
ha
ha
i
imagined
i
had
discovered
a
new
word
i
rise
up
in
bed
and
say
it
is
not
in
the
language
i
have
discovered
it
it
has
letters
as
a
word
has
by
the
benign
god
man
you
have
discovered
a
word
a
word
of
profound
import
i
sit
with
open
eyes
amazed
at
my
own
find
and
laugh
for
joy
then
i
begin
to
whisper
some
one
might
spy
on
me
and
i
intended
to
keep
my
discovery
a
secret
i
entered
into
the
joyous
frenzy
of
hunger
i
was
empty
and
free
from
pain
and
i
gave
free
rein
to
my
thoughts
in
all
calmness
i
revolve
things
in
my
mind
with
the
most
singular
jerks
in
my
chain
of
ideas
i
seek
to
explain
the
meaning
of
my
new
word
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
to
mean
either
god
or
the
tivoli
footnote
theatre
of
varieties
and
garden
in
christiania
and
who
said
that
it
was
to
signify
cattle
show
i
clench
my
hands
fiercely
and
repeat
once
again
who
said
that
it
was
to
signify
cattle
show
no
on
second
thoughts
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
that
it
should
mean
padlock
or
sunrise
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
a
meaning
for
such
a
word
as
this
i
would
wait
and
see
in
the
meantime
i
could
sleep
on
it
i
lie
there
on
the
and
laugh
slily
but
say
nothing
give
vent
to
no
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
some
minutes
pass
over
and
i
wax
nervous
this
new
word
torments
me
unceasingly
returns
again
and
again
takes
up
my
thoughts
and
makes
me
serious
i
had
fully
formed
an
opinion
as
to
what
it
should
not
signify
but
had
come
to
no
conclusion
as
to
what
it
should
signify
that
is
quite
a
matter
of
detail
i
said
aloud
to
myself
and
i
clutched
my
arm
and
reiterated
that
is
quite
a
matter
of
detail
the
word
was
found
god
be
praised
and
that
was
the
principal
thing
but
ideas
worry
me
without
end
and
hinder
me
from
falling
asleep
nothing
seemed
good
enough
to
me
for
this
unusually
rare
word
at
length
i
sit
up
in
bed
again
grasp
my
head
in
both
hands
and
say
no
it
is
just
this
it
is
impossible
to
let
it
signify
emigration
or
tobacco
factory
if
it
could
have
meant
anything
like
that
i
would
have
decided
upon
it
long
since
and
taken
the
consequences
no
in
reality
the
word
is
fitted
to
signify
something
psychical
a
feeling
a
state
could
i
not
apprehend
it
and
i
reflect
profoundly
in
order
to
find
something
psychical
then
it
seems
to
me
that
some
one
is
interposing
interrupting
my
confab
i
answer
angrily
beg
pardon
your
match
in
idiocy
is
not
to
be
found
no
sir
knitting
cotton
ah
go
to
hell
well
really
i
had
to
laugh
might
i
ask
why
should
i
be
forced
to
let
it
signify
knitting
cotton
when
i
had
a
special
dislike
to
its
signifying
knitting
cotton
i
had
discovered
the
word
myself
so
for
that
matter
i
was
perfectly
within
my
right
in
letting
it
signify
whatsoever
i
pleased
as
far
as
i
was
aware
i
had
not
yet
expressed
an
opinion
as
to
but
my
brain
got
more
and
more
confused
at
last
i
sprang
out
of
bed
to
look
for
the
i
was
not
thirsty
but
my
head
was
in
a
fever
and
i
felt
an
instinctive
longing
for
water
when
i
had
drunk
some
i
got
into
bed
again
and
determined
with
all
my
might
to
settle
to
sleep
i
closed
my
eyes
and
forced
myself
to
keep
quiet
i
lay
thus
for
some
minutes
without
making
a
movement
sweated
and
felt
my
blood
jerk
violently
through
my
veins
no
it
was
really
too
delicious
the
way
he
thought
to
find
money
in
the
paper
cornet
he
only
coughed
once
too
i
wonder
if
he
is
pacing
up
and
down
there
yet
sitting
on
my
bench
the
pearly
blue
sea
the
ships
i
opened
my
eyes
how
could
i
keep
them
shut
when
i
could
not
sleep
the
same
darkness
brooded
over
me
the
same
unfathomable
black
eternity
which
my
thoughts
strove
against
and
could
not
understand
i
made
the
most
despairing
efforts
to
find
a
word
black
enough
to
characterize
this
darkness
a
word
so
horribly
black
that
it
would
darken
my
lips
if
i
named
it
lord
how
dark
it
was
and
i
am
carried
back
in
thought
to
the
sea
and
the
dark
monsters
that
lay
in
wait
for
me
they
would
draw
me
to
them
and
clutch
me
tightly
and
bear
me
away
by
land
and
sea
through
dark
realms
that
no
soul
has
seen
i
feel
myself
on
board
drawn
through
waters
hovering
in
clouds
sinking
sinking
i
give
a
hoarse
cry
of
terror
clutch
the
bed
tightly
i
had
made
such
a
perilous
journey
whizzing
down
through
space
like
a
bolt
oh
did
i
not
feel
that
i
was
saved
as
i
struck
my
hands
against
the
wooden
frame
this
is
the
way
one
dies
said
i
to
myself
now
you
will
die
and
i
lay
for
a
while
and
thought
over
that
i
was
to
die
then
i
start
up
in
bed
and
ask
severely
if
i
found
the
word
am
i
not
absolutely
within
my
right
to
decide
myself
what
it
is
to
signify
i
could
hear
myself
that
i
was
raving
i
could
hear
it
now
whilst
i
was
talking
my
madness
was
a
delirium
of
weakness
and
prostration
but
i
was
not
out
of
my
senses
all
at
once
the
thought
darted
through
my
brain
that
i
was
insane
seized
with
terror
i
spring
out
of
bed
again
i
stagger
to
the
door
which
i
try
to
open
fling
myself
against
it
a
couple
of
times
to
burst
it
strike
my
head
against
the
wall
bewail
loudly
bite
my
fingers
cry
and
curse
all
was
quiet
only
my
own
voice
echoed
from
the
walls
i
had
fallen
to
the
floor
incapable
of
stumbling
about
the
cell
any
longer
lying
there
i
catch
a
glimpse
high
up
straight
before
my
eyes
of
a
greyish
square
in
the
wall
a
suggestion
of
white
a
presage
it
must
be
of
daylight
i
felt
it
must
be
daylight
felt
it
through
every
pore
in
my
body
oh
did
i
not
draw
a
breath
of
delighted
relief
i
flung
myself
flat
on
the
floor
and
cried
for
very
joy
over
this
blessed
glimpse
of
light
sobbed
for
very
gratitude
blew
a
kiss
to
the
window
and
conducted
myself
like
a
maniac
and
at
this
moment
i
was
perfectly
conscious
of
what
i
was
doing
all
my
dejection
had
vanished
all
despair
and
pain
had
ceased
and
i
had
at
this
moment
at
least
as
far
as
my
thought
reached
not
a
wish
unfilled
i
sat
up
on
the
floor
folded
my
hands
and
waited
patiently
for
the
dawn
what
a
night
this
had
been
that
they
had
not
heard
any
noise
i
thought
with
astonishment
but
then
i
was
in
the
reserved
section
high
above
all
the
prisoners
a
homeless
cabinet
minister
if
i
might
say
so
still
in
the
best
of
humours
with
eyes
turned
towards
the
lighter
ever
lighter
square
in
the
wall
i
amused
myself
acting
cabinet
minister
called
myself
von
tangen
and
clothed
my
speech
in
a
dress
of
my
fancies
had
not
ceased
but
i
was
far
less
nervous
if
i
only
had
not
been
thoughtless
enough
to
leave
my
at
home
might
i
not
have
the
honour
of
assisting
his
right
honourable
the
prime
minister
to
bed
and
in
all
seriousness
and
with
much
ceremony
i
went
over
to
the
stretcher
and
lay
down
by
this
it
was
so
light
that
i
could
distinguish
in
some
degree
the
outlines
of
the
cell
and
little
by
little
the
heavy
handle
of
the
door
this
diverted
me
the
monotonous
darkness
so
irritating
in
its
impenetrability
that
it
prevented
me
from
seeing
myself
was
broken
my
blood
flowed
more
quietly
i
soon
felt
my
eyes
close
i
was
aroused
by
a
couple
of
knocks
on
my
door
i
jumped
up
in
all
haste
and
clad
myself
hurriedly
my
clothes
were
still
wet
through
from
last
night
you
report
yourself
downstairs
to
the
officer
on
duty
said
the
constable
were
there
more
formalities
to
be
gone
through
then
i
thought
with
fear
below
i
entered
a
large
room
where
thirty
or
forty
people
sat
all
homeless
they
were
called
up
one
by
one
by
the
registering
clerk
and
one
by
one
they
received
a
ticket
for
breakfast
the
officer
on
duty
repeated
constantly
to
the
policeman
at
his
side
did
he
get
a
ticket
do
forget
to
give
them
tickets
they
look
as
if
they
wanted
a
meal
and
i
stood
and
looked
at
these
tickets
and
wished
i
had
one
andreas
tangen
journalist
i
advanced
and
bowed
but
my
dear
fellow
how
did
you
come
here
i
explained
the
whole
state
of
the
case
repeated
the
same
story
as
last
night
lied
without
winking
lied
with
frankness
had
been
out
rather
late
worse
luck
café
lost
yes
he
said
and
he
smiled
that
the
way
did
you
sleep
well
then
i
answered
like
a
cabinet
minister
like
a
cabinet
minister
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
said
and
he
stood
up
and
i
went
a
ticket
a
ticket
for
me
too
i
have
not
eaten
for
more
than
three
long
days
and
nights
a
loaf
but
no
one
offered
me
a
ticket
and
i
dared
not
demand
one
it
would
have
roused
suspicion
at
once
they
would
begin
to
poke
their
noses
into
my
private
affairs
and
discover
who
i
really
was
they
might
arrest
me
for
false
pretences
and
so
with
elevated
head
the
carriage
of
a
millionaire
and
hands
thrust
under
my
i
stride
out
of
the
the
sun
shone
warmly
early
as
it
was
it
was
ten
and
the
traffic
in
young
market
was
in
full
swing
which
way
should
i
take
i
slapped
my
pockets
and
felt
for
my
manuscript
at
eleven
i
would
try
and
see
the
editor
i
stand
a
while
on
the
balustrade
and
watch
the
bustle
under
me
meanwhile
my
clothes
commenced
to
steam
hunger
put
in
its
appearance
afresh
gnawed
at
my
breast
clutched
me
and
gave
small
sharp
stabs
that
caused
me
pain
had
i
not
a
friend
an
acquaintance
whom
i
could
apply
to
i
ransack
my
memory
to
find
a
man
good
for
a
penny
piece
and
fail
to
find
him
well
it
was
a
lovely
day
anyway
sunlight
bright
and
warm
surrounded
me
the
sky
stretched
away
like
a
beautiful
sea
over
the
lier
mountains
without
knowing
it
i
was
on
my
way
home
i
hungered
sorely
i
found
a
chip
of
wood
in
the
street
to
chew
that
helped
a
bit
to
think
that
i
had
thought
of
that
sooner
the
door
was
open
the
bade
me
as
usual
fine
weather
said
he
yes
i
replied
that
was
all
i
found
to
say
could
i
ask
for
the
loan
of
a
shilling
he
would
be
sure
to
lend
it
willingly
if
he
could
besides
that
i
had
written
a
letter
for
him
once
he
stood
and
turned
something
over
in
his
mind
before
he
ventured
on
saying
it
fine
weather
ahem
i
ought
to
pay
my
landlady
today
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
lend
me
five
shillings
would
you
only
for
a
few
days
sir
you
did
me
a
service
once
before
so
you
did
no
i
really
ca
do
it
jens
olaj
i
answered
not
now
perhaps
later
on
maybe
in
the
afternoon
and
i
staggered
up
the
stairs
to
my
room
i
flung
myself
on
my
bed
and
laughed
how
confoundedly
lucky
it
was
that
he
had
forestalled
me
my
was
saved
five
shillings
god
bless
you
man
you
might
just
as
well
have
asked
me
for
five
shares
in
the
dampkökken
or
an
estate
out
in
aker
and
the
thought
of
these
five
shillings
made
me
laugh
louder
and
louder
was
i
a
devil
of
a
fellow
eh
five
shillings
my
mirth
increased
and
i
gave
way
to
it
ugh
what
a
shocking
smell
of
cooking
there
was
here
a
downright
disgustingly
strong
smell
of
chops
for
dinner
phew
and
i
flung
open
the
window
to
let
out
this
beastly
smell
waiter
a
plate
of
beef
turning
to
the
table
this
miserable
table
that
i
was
forced
to
support
with
my
knees
when
i
wrote
i
bowed
profoundly
and
said
may
i
ask
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
no
i
am
tangen
tangen
the
cabinet
minister
i
more
the
pity
i
was
out
a
little
late
the
once
more
my
thoughts
ran
without
rein
in
intricate
paths
i
was
continually
conscious
that
i
talked
at
random
and
yet
i
gave
utterance
to
no
word
without
hearing
and
understanding
it
i
said
to
myself
now
you
are
talking
at
random
again
and
yet
i
could
not
help
myself
it
was
as
if
one
were
lying
awake
and
yet
talking
in
sleep
my
head
was
light
without
pain
and
without
pressure
and
my
mood
was
unshadowed
it
sailed
away
with
me
and
i
made
no
effort
come
in
yes
only
come
right
in
as
you
see
everything
is
of
ruby
ylajali
ylajali
that
swelling
crimson
silken
divan
ah
how
passionately
she
breathes
kiss
me
loved
one
more
more
your
arms
are
like
pale
amber
your
mouth
blushes
waiter
i
asked
for
a
plate
of
beef
the
sun
gleamed
in
through
the
window
and
i
could
hear
the
horses
below
chewing
oats
i
sat
and
mumbled
over
my
chip
gaily
glad
at
heart
as
a
child
i
kept
all
the
time
feeling
for
my
manuscript
it
was
really
in
my
thoughts
but
instinct
told
me
it
was
there
was
in
my
blood
to
remember
it
and
i
took
it
out
it
had
got
wet
and
i
spread
it
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
then
i
took
to
wandering
up
and
down
the
room
how
depressing
everything
looked
small
scraps
of
tin
shavings
were
trodden
into
the
floor
there
was
not
a
chair
to
sit
upon
not
even
a
nail
in
the
bare
walls
everything
had
been
brought
to
my
uncle
and
consumed
a
few
sheets
of
paper
lying
on
the
table
covered
with
thick
dust
were
my
sole
possession
the
old
green
blanket
on
the
bed
was
lent
to
me
by
hans
pauli
some
months
ago
hans
pauli
i
snap
my
fingers
hans
pauli
pettersen
shall
help
me
he
would
certainly
be
very
angry
that
i
had
not
appealed
to
him
at
once
i
put
on
my
hat
in
haste
gather
up
the
manuscript
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
and
hurry
downstairs
listen
jens
olaj
i
called
into
the
stable
i
am
nearly
certain
i
can
help
you
in
the
afternoon
arrived
at
the
town
hall
i
saw
that
it
was
past
eleven
and
i
determined
on
going
to
the
editor
at
once
i
stopped
outside
the
office
door
to
see
if
my
sheets
were
paged
rightly
smoothed
them
carefully
out
put
them
back
in
my
pocket
and
knocked
my
heart
beat
audibly
as
i
entered
scissors
is
there
as
usual
i
inquire
timorously
for
the
editor
no
answer
the
man
sits
and
probes
for
minor
items
of
news
amongst
the
provincial
papers
i
repeat
my
question
and
advance
a
little
farther
the
editor
has
not
come
yet
said
scissors
at
length
without
looking
up
how
soon
would
he
come
could
say
could
say
at
all
how
long
would
the
office
be
open
to
this
i
received
no
answer
so
i
was
forced
to
leave
scissors
had
not
once
looked
up
at
me
during
all
this
scene
he
had
heard
my
voice
and
recognized
me
by
it
you
are
in
such
bad
odour
here
thought
i
that
he
does
even
take
the
trouble
to
answer
you
i
wonder
if
that
is
an
order
of
the
editor
i
had
is
true
enough
right
from
the
day
my
celebrated
story
was
accepted
for
ten
shillings
overwhelmed
him
with
work
rushed
to
his
door
nearly
every
day
with
unsuitable
things
that
he
was
obliged
to
peruse
only
to
return
them
to
me
perhaps
he
wished
to
put
an
end
to
this
take
stringent
measures
i
took
the
road
to
homandsbyen
hans
pauli
pettersen
was
a
son
a
student
living
in
the
attic
of
a
house
therefore
hans
pauli
pettersen
was
a
poor
man
but
if
he
had
a
shilling
he
would
stint
it
i
would
get
it
just
as
sure
as
if
i
already
held
it
in
my
hand
and
i
rejoiced
the
whole
time
as
i
went
over
the
shilling
and
felt
confident
i
would
get
it
when
i
got
to
the
street
door
it
was
closed
and
i
had
to
ring
i
want
to
see
student
pettersen
i
said
and
was
about
to
step
inside
i
know
his
room
student
pettersen
repeats
the
girl
was
it
he
who
had
the
attic
he
had
moved
well
she
did
know
the
address
but
he
had
asked
his
letters
to
be
sent
to
hermansen
in
and
she
mentioned
the
number
i
go
full
of
trust
and
hope
all
the
way
to
to
ask
hans
pauli
address
being
my
last
chance
i
must
turn
it
to
account
on
the
way
i
came
to
a
house
where
a
couple
of
joiners
stood
planing
outside
i
picked
up
a
few
satiny
shavings
from
the
heap
stuck
one
in
my
mouth
and
the
other
in
my
pocket
for
and
continued
my
journey
i
groaned
with
hunger
i
had
seen
a
marvellously
large
penny
loaf
at
a
baker
the
largest
i
could
possibly
get
for
the
price
i
come
to
find
out
student
pettersen
address
bernt
akers
street
no
in
the
attic
was
i
going
out
there
well
would
i
perhaps
be
kind
enough
to
take
out
a
couple
of
letters
that
had
come
for
him
i
trudge
up
town
again
along
the
same
road
pass
by
the
joiners
who
are
sitting
with
their
cans
between
their
knees
eating
their
good
warm
dinner
from
the
dampkökken
pass
the
bakers
where
the
loaf
is
still
in
its
place
and
at
length
reach
bernt
akers
street
half
dead
with
fatigue
the
door
is
open
and
i
mount
all
the
weary
stairs
to
the
attic
i
take
the
letters
out
of
my
pocket
in
order
to
put
hans
pauli
into
a
good
humour
on
the
moment
of
my
entrance
he
would
be
certain
not
to
refuse
to
give
me
a
helping
hand
when
i
explained
how
things
were
with
me
no
certainly
not
hans
pauli
had
such
a
big
heart
i
had
always
said
that
of
him
i
discovered
his
card
fastened
to
the
door
pettersen
theological
student
home
i
sat
down
without
more
ado
sat
down
on
the
bare
floor
dulled
with
fatigue
fairly
beaten
with
exhaustion
i
mechanically
mutter
a
couple
of
times
gone
home
gone
home
then
i
keep
perfectly
quiet
there
was
not
a
tear
in
my
eyes
i
had
not
a
thought
not
a
feeling
of
any
kind
i
sat
and
stared
with
eyes
at
the
letters
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
ten
minutes
went
over
perhaps
twenty
or
more
i
sat
stolidly
on
the
one
spot
and
did
not
move
a
finger
this
numb
feeling
of
drowsiness
was
almost
like
a
brief
slumber
i
hear
some
one
come
up
the
stairs
it
was
student
pettersen
i
i
have
two
letters
for
him
he
has
gone
home
replies
the
woman
but
he
will
return
after
the
holidays
i
could
take
the
letters
if
you
like
yes
thanks
that
was
all
right
said
i
he
could
get
them
then
when
he
came
back
they
might
contain
matters
of
importance
when
i
got
outside
i
came
to
a
standstill
and
said
loudly
in
the
open
street
as
i
clenched
my
hands
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
my
good
lord
god
you
are
a
bungler
and
i
nod
furiously
with
set
teeth
up
to
the
clouds
i
will
be
hanged
if
you
are
not
a
bungler
then
i
took
a
few
strides
and
stopped
again
suddenly
changing
my
attitude
i
fold
my
hands
hold
my
head
to
one
side
and
ask
with
an
unctuous
sanctimonious
tone
of
voice
hast
thou
appealed
also
to
him
my
child
it
did
not
sound
right
with
a
large
h
i
say
with
an
h
as
big
as
a
cathedral
once
again
hast
thou
invoked
him
my
child
and
i
incline
my
head
and
i
make
my
voice
whine
and
answer
no
that
did
sound
right
either
you
ca
play
the
hypocrite
you
idiot
yes
you
should
say
i
have
invoked
god
my
father
and
you
must
set
your
words
to
the
most
piteous
tune
you
have
ever
heard
in
your
life
so
o
once
again
come
that
was
better
but
you
must
sigh
like
a
horse
down
with
the
colic
so
o
that
right
thus
i
go
drilling
myself
in
hypocrisy
stamp
impatiently
in
the
street
when
i
fail
to
succeed
rail
at
myself
for
being
such
a
blockhead
whilst
the
astonished
turn
round
and
stare
at
me
i
chewed
uninterruptedly
at
my
shaving
and
proceeded
as
steadily
as
i
could
along
the
street
before
i
realized
it
i
was
at
the
railway
square
the
dock
on
our
saviour
pointed
to
one
i
stood
for
a
bit
and
considered
a
faint
sweat
forced
itself
out
on
my
face
and
trickled
down
my
eyelids
accompany
me
down
to
the
bridge
said
i
to
myself
that
is
to
say
if
you
have
spare
time
and
i
made
a
bow
to
myself
and
turned
towards
the
railway
bridge
near
the
wharf
the
ships
lay
there
and
the
sea
rocked
in
the
sunshine
there
was
bustle
and
movement
everywhere
shrieking
quay
porters
with
cases
on
their
shoulders
lively
shanties
coming
from
the
prams
an
old
woman
a
vendor
of
cakes
sits
near
me
and
bends
her
brown
nose
down
over
her
wares
the
little
table
before
her
is
sinfully
full
of
nice
things
and
i
turn
away
with
distaste
she
is
filling
the
whole
quay
with
her
smell
of
cakes
phew
up
with
the
windows
i
accosted
a
gentleman
sitting
at
my
side
and
represented
forcibly
to
him
the
nuisance
of
having
here
there
eh
yes
but
he
must
really
admit
that
but
the
good
man
smelt
a
rat
and
did
not
give
me
time
to
finish
speaking
for
he
got
up
and
left
i
rose
too
and
followed
him
firmly
determined
to
convince
him
of
his
mistake
if
it
was
only
out
of
consideration
for
sanitary
conditions
said
i
and
i
slapped
him
on
the
shoulders
excuse
me
i
am
a
stranger
here
and
know
nothing
of
the
sanitary
conditions
he
replied
and
stared
at
me
with
positive
fear
oh
that
alters
the
case
if
he
was
a
stranger
could
i
not
render
him
a
service
in
any
way
show
him
about
really
not
because
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
and
it
would
cost
him
nothing
but
the
man
wanted
absolutely
to
get
rid
of
me
and
he
sheered
off
in
all
haste
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
i
returned
to
the
bench
and
sat
down
i
was
fearfully
disturbed
and
the
big
street
organ
that
had
begun
to
grind
a
tune
a
little
farther
away
made
me
still
worse
a
regular
metallic
music
a
fragment
of
weber
to
which
a
little
girl
is
singing
a
mournful
strain
the
sorrowfulness
of
the
organ
thrills
through
my
blood
my
nerves
vibrate
in
responsive
echo
a
moment
later
and
i
fall
back
on
the
seat
whimpering
and
crooning
in
time
to
it
oh
what
strange
freaks
one
thoughts
are
guilty
of
when
one
is
starving
i
feel
myself
lifted
up
by
these
notes
dissolved
in
tones
and
i
float
out
i
feel
so
clearly
how
i
float
out
soaring
high
above
the
mountains
dancing
through
zones
of
light
a
halfpenny
whines
the
little
reaching
forth
her
little
tin
plate
only
a
halfpenny
yes
i
said
unthinkingly
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
ransacked
all
my
pockets
but
the
child
thinks
i
only
want
to
make
fun
of
her
and
she
goes
away
at
once
without
saying
a
word
this
dumb
forbearance
was
too
much
for
me
if
she
had
abused
me
it
would
have
been
more
endurable
i
was
stung
with
pain
and
recalled
her
i
do
possess
a
farthing
but
i
will
remember
you
later
on
maybe
tomorrow
what
is
your
name
yes
that
is
a
pretty
name
i
wo
forget
it
till
tomorrow
then
but
i
understood
quite
well
that
she
did
not
believe
me
although
she
never
said
one
word
and
i
cried
with
despair
because
this
little
street
wench
would
not
believe
in
me
once
again
i
called
her
back
tore
open
my
coat
and
was
about
to
give
her
my
waistcoat
i
will
make
up
to
you
for
it
said
i
wait
only
a
moment
and
lo
i
had
no
waistcoat
what
in
the
world
made
me
look
for
it
weeks
had
gone
by
since
it
was
in
my
possession
what
was
the
matter
with
me
anyway
the
astonished
child
waited
no
longer
but
withdrew
fearsomely
and
i
was
compelled
to
let
her
go
people
throng
round
me
laugh
aloud
a
policeman
thrusts
his
way
through
to
me
and
wants
to
know
what
is
the
row
nothing
i
reply
nothing
at
all
i
only
wanted
to
give
the
little
girl
over
there
my
waistcoat
for
her
father
you
need
stand
there
and
laugh
at
that
i
have
only
to
go
home
and
put
on
another
no
disturbance
in
the
street
says
the
constable
so
march
and
he
gives
me
a
shove
on
is
them
your
papers
he
calls
after
me
yes
by
jove
my
newspaper
leader
many
important
papers
however
could
i
be
so
careless
i
snatch
up
my
manuscript
convince
myself
that
it
is
lying
in
order
and
go
without
stopping
a
second
or
looking
about
me
towards
the
editor
office
it
was
now
four
by
the
clock
of
our
saviour
church
the
office
is
shut
i
stead
noiselessly
down
the
stairs
frightened
as
a
thief
and
stand
irresolutely
outside
the
door
what
should
i
do
now
i
lean
up
against
the
wall
stare
down
at
the
stones
and
consider
a
pin
is
lying
glistening
at
my
feet
i
stoop
and
pick
it
up
supposing
i
were
to
cut
the
buttons
off
my
coat
how
much
could
i
get
for
them
perhaps
it
would
be
no
use
though
buttons
are
buttons
but
yet
i
look
and
examine
them
and
find
them
as
good
as
new
that
was
a
lucky
idea
all
the
same
i
could
cut
them
off
with
my
penknife
and
take
them
to
the
the
hope
of
being
able
to
sell
these
five
buttons
cheered
me
immediately
and
i
cried
see
see
it
will
all
come
right
my
delight
got
the
upper
hand
of
me
and
i
at
once
set
to
cut
off
the
buttons
one
by
one
whilst
thus
occupied
i
held
the
following
hushed
soliloquy
yes
you
see
one
has
become
a
little
impoverished
a
momentary
embarrassment
worn
out
do
you
say
you
must
not
make
slips
when
you
speak
i
would
like
to
see
the
person
who
wears
out
less
buttons
than
i
do
i
can
tell
you
i
always
go
with
my
coat
open
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
an
idiosyncrasy
no
no
of
course
if
you
well
but
i
must
have
a
penny
for
them
at
least
no
indeed
who
said
you
were
obliged
to
do
it
you
can
hold
your
tongue
and
leave
me
in
peace
yes
well
you
can
fetch
a
policeman
ca
you
i
wait
here
whilst
you
are
out
looking
for
him
and
i
wo
steal
anything
from
you
well
my
name
by
the
way
is
tangen
have
been
out
a
little
late
some
one
comes
up
the
stairs
i
am
recalled
at
once
to
reality
i
recognize
scissors
and
put
the
buttons
carefully
into
my
pocket
he
attempts
to
pass
does
even
acknowledge
my
nod
is
suddenly
intently
busied
with
his
nails
i
stop
him
and
inquire
for
the
editor
not
in
do
you
hear
you
lie
i
said
and
with
a
cheek
that
fairly
amazed
myself
i
continued
i
must
have
a
word
with
him
it
is
a
necessary
errand
communications
from
the
stiftsgaarden
footnote
dwelling
of
the
civil
governor
of
a
stift
or
diocese
well
ca
you
tell
me
what
it
is
then
tell
you
and
i
looked
scissors
up
and
down
this
had
the
desired
effect
he
accompanied
me
at
once
and
opened
the
door
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
now
i
set
my
teeth
to
try
and
revive
my
courage
knocked
and
entered
the
editor
private
office
is
it
you
he
asked
kindly
sit
down
if
he
had
shown
me
the
door
it
would
have
been
almost
as
acceptable
i
felt
as
if
i
were
on
the
point
of
crying
and
said
i
beg
you
will
excuse
pray
sit
down
he
repeated
and
i
sat
down
and
explained
that
i
again
had
an
article
which
i
was
extremely
anxious
to
get
into
his
paper
i
had
taken
such
pains
with
it
it
had
cost
me
much
effort
i
will
read
it
said
he
and
he
took
it
everything
you
write
is
certain
to
cost
you
effort
but
you
are
far
too
impetuous
if
you
could
only
be
a
little
more
sober
there
too
much
fever
in
the
meantime
i
will
read
it
and
he
turned
to
the
table
again
there
i
sat
dared
i
ask
for
a
shilling
explain
to
him
why
there
was
always
fever
he
would
be
sure
to
aid
me
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
stood
up
hum
but
the
last
time
i
was
with
him
he
had
complained
about
money
and
had
sent
a
messenger
out
to
scrape
some
together
for
me
maybe
it
might
be
the
same
case
now
no
it
should
not
occur
could
i
not
see
then
that
he
was
sitting
at
work
was
there
otherwise
anything
he
inquired
no
i
answered
and
i
compelled
my
voice
to
sound
steady
about
how
soon
shall
i
call
in
again
oh
any
time
you
are
passing
in
a
couple
of
days
or
so
i
could
not
get
my
request
over
my
lips
this
man
friendliness
seemed
to
me
beyond
bounds
and
i
ought
to
know
how
to
appreciate
it
rather
die
of
hunger
i
went
not
even
when
i
was
outside
the
door
and
felt
once
more
the
pangs
of
hunger
did
i
repent
having
left
the
office
without
having
asked
for
that
shilling
i
took
the
other
shaving
out
of
my
pocket
and
stuck
it
into
my
mouth
it
helped
why
had
i
done
so
before
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
said
aloud
could
it
really
have
entered
your
head
to
ask
the
man
for
a
shilling
and
put
him
to
inconvenience
again
and
i
got
downright
angry
with
myself
for
the
effrontery
of
which
i
had
almost
been
guilty
that
is
by
god
the
shabbiest
thing
i
ever
heard
said
i
to
rush
at
a
man
and
nearly
tear
the
eyes
out
of
his
head
just
because
you
happen
to
need
a
shilling
you
miserable
dog
so
o
march
quicker
quicker
you
big
thumping
lout
i
teach
you
i
commenced
to
run
to
punish
myself
left
one
street
after
the
other
behind
me
at
a
bound
goaded
myself
on
with
suppressed
cries
and
shrieked
dumbly
and
furiously
at
myself
whenever
i
was
about
to
halt
thus
i
arrived
a
long
way
up
pyle
street
when
at
last
i
stood
still
almost
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
at
not
being
able
to
run
any
farther
i
was
trembling
over
my
whole
body
and
i
flung
myself
down
on
a
step
no
stop
i
said
and
in
order
to
torture
myself
rightly
i
arose
again
and
forced
myself
to
keep
standing
i
jeered
at
myself
and
hugged
myself
with
pleasure
at
the
spectacle
of
my
own
exhaustion
at
length
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
moments
i
gave
myself
with
a
nod
permission
to
be
seated
though
even
then
i
chose
the
most
uncomfortable
place
on
the
steps
lord
how
delicious
it
was
to
rest
i
dried
the
sweat
off
my
face
and
drew
great
refreshing
breaths
how
had
i
not
run
but
i
was
not
sorry
i
had
richly
deserved
it
why
did
i
want
to
ask
for
that
shilling
now
i
could
see
the
consequences
and
i
began
to
talk
mildly
to
myself
dealing
out
admonitions
as
a
mother
might
have
done
i
grew
more
and
more
moved
and
tired
and
weak
as
i
was
i
fell
a
quiet
cry
an
inner
sobbing
without
a
tear
i
sat
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
in
the
same
place
people
came
and
went
and
no
one
molested
me
little
children
played
about
around
me
and
a
little
bird
sang
on
a
tree
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
policeman
came
towards
me
why
do
you
sit
here
said
he
why
do
i
sit
here
i
replied
for
pleasure
i
have
been
watching
you
for
the
last
you
sat
here
now
about
that
i
replied
anything
more
i
got
up
in
a
temper
and
walked
on
arrived
at
the
i
stopped
and
gazed
down
the
street
for
pleasure
now
was
that
an
answer
to
give
for
weariness
you
should
have
replied
and
made
your
voice
whining
you
are
a
booby
you
will
never
learn
to
dissemble
from
exhaustion
and
you
should
have
gasped
like
a
horse
when
i
got
to
the
fire
i
halted
afresh
seized
by
a
new
idea
i
snapped
my
fingers
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
that
confounded
the
and
said
now
you
shall
just
go
to
levion
the
parson
you
shall
as
sure
as
death
ay
just
for
a
try
what
have
you
got
to
lose
by
it
and
it
is
such
glorious
weather
i
entered
pascha
found
pastor
levion
address
in
the
directory
and
started
for
it
now
for
it
said
i
play
no
pranks
conscience
did
you
say
no
rubbish
if
you
please
you
are
too
poor
to
support
a
conscience
you
are
hungry
you
have
come
on
important
business
the
first
thing
needful
but
you
shall
hold
your
head
askew
and
set
your
words
to
a
you
wo
what
well
then
i
wo
go
a
step
farther
do
you
hear
that
indeed
you
are
in
a
sorely
tempted
condition
fighting
with
the
powers
of
darkness
and
great
voiceless
monsters
at
night
so
that
it
is
a
horror
to
think
of
you
hunger
and
thirst
for
wine
and
milk
and
do
get
them
it
has
gone
so
far
with
you
here
you
stand
and
have
as
much
as
a
halfpenny
to
bless
yourself
with
but
you
believe
in
grace
the
lord
be
praised
you
have
yet
lost
your
faith
and
then
you
must
clasp
your
hands
together
and
look
a
very
satan
of
a
fellow
for
believing
in
grace
as
far
as
mammon
was
concerned
why
you
hated
mammon
with
all
its
pomps
in
any
form
now
it
quite
another
thing
with
a
a
souvenir
to
the
extent
of
a
few
shillings
i
stopped
at
the
pastor
door
and
read
office
hours
to
mind
no
fudge
i
said
now
we
go
ahead
in
earnest
so
hang
your
head
a
little
more
and
i
rang
at
the
private
entrance
i
want
to
see
the
pastor
said
i
to
the
maid
but
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
get
in
god
name
yet
awhile
he
has
gone
out
gone
out
gone
out
that
destroyed
my
whole
plan
scattered
all
i
intended
to
say
to
the
four
winds
what
had
i
gained
then
by
the
long
walk
there
i
stood
was
it
anything
particular
questioned
the
maid
not
at
all
i
replied
not
at
all
it
was
only
just
that
it
was
such
glorious
god
weather
that
i
thought
i
would
come
out
and
make
a
call
there
i
stood
and
there
she
stood
i
purposely
thrust
out
my
chest
to
attract
her
attention
to
the
pin
that
held
my
coat
together
i
implored
her
with
a
look
to
see
what
i
had
come
for
but
the
poor
creature
did
understand
it
at
all
lovely
god
weather
was
not
the
mistress
at
home
either
yes
but
she
had
gout
and
lay
on
a
sofa
without
being
able
to
move
herself
perhaps
i
would
leave
a
message
or
something
no
not
at
all
i
only
just
took
walks
like
this
now
and
again
just
for
exercise
it
was
so
wholesome
after
dinner
i
set
out
on
the
road
back
what
would
gossiping
longer
lead
to
besides
i
commenced
to
feel
dizzy
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
i
was
about
to
break
down
in
earnest
office
hours
from
to
i
had
knocked
at
the
door
an
hour
too
late
the
time
of
grace
was
over
i
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
near
the
church
in
the
market
lord
how
black
things
began
to
look
for
me
now
i
did
not
cry
i
was
too
utterly
tired
worn
to
the
last
degree
i
sat
there
without
trying
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
sad
motionless
and
starving
my
chest
was
much
inflamed
it
smarted
most
strangely
and
sorely
nor
would
chewing
shavings
help
me
much
longer
my
jaws
were
tired
of
that
barren
work
and
i
let
them
rest
i
simply
gave
up
a
brown
too
i
had
found
in
the
street
and
which
i
had
at
once
commenced
to
chew
had
given
me
nausea
i
was
ill
the
veins
swelled
up
bluely
on
my
wrists
what
was
it
i
had
really
sought
after
run
about
the
whole
day
for
a
shilling
that
would
but
keep
life
in
me
for
a
few
hours
longer
considering
all
was
it
not
a
matter
of
indifference
if
the
inevitable
took
place
one
day
earlier
or
one
day
later
if
i
had
conducted
myself
like
an
ordinary
being
i
should
have
gone
home
long
ago
and
laid
myself
down
to
rest
and
given
in
my
mind
was
clear
for
a
moment
now
i
was
to
die
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
fall
and
all
things
were
hushed
to
sleep
i
had
tried
every
means
exhausted
every
resource
of
which
i
knew
i
fondled
this
thought
sentimentally
and
each
time
i
still
hoped
for
a
possible
succour
i
whispered
repudiatingly
you
fool
you
have
already
begun
to
die
i
ought
to
write
a
couple
of
letters
make
all
ready
prepare
myself
i
would
wash
myself
carefully
and
tidy
my
bed
nicely
i
would
lay
my
head
upon
the
sheets
of
white
paper
the
cleanest
things
i
had
left
and
the
green
blanket
i
the
green
blanket
like
a
shot
i
was
wide
awake
the
blood
mounted
to
my
head
and
i
got
violent
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
arise
from
the
seat
and
start
to
walk
life
stirs
again
in
all
my
fibres
and
time
after
time
i
repeat
disconnectedly
the
green
blanket
the
green
blanket
i
go
faster
and
faster
as
if
it
is
a
case
of
fetching
something
and
stand
after
a
little
time
in
my
workshop
without
pausing
a
moment
or
wavering
in
my
resolution
i
go
over
to
the
bed
and
roll
up
hans
pauli
blanket
it
was
a
strange
thing
if
this
bright
idea
of
mine
could
save
me
i
rose
infinitely
superior
to
the
stupid
scruples
which
sprang
up
in
me
half
inward
cries
about
a
certain
stain
on
my
honour
i
bade
to
the
whole
of
them
i
was
no
hero
no
virtuous
idiot
i
had
my
senses
left
so
i
took
the
blanket
under
my
arm
and
went
to
no
stener
street
i
knocked
and
entered
the
big
strange
room
for
the
first
time
the
bell
on
the
door
above
my
head
gave
a
lot
of
violent
jerks
a
man
enters
from
a
side
room
chewing
his
mouth
is
full
of
food
and
stands
behind
the
counter
eh
lend
me
sixpence
on
my
said
i
i
shall
release
them
in
a
couple
of
days
without
fail
eh
no
they
steel
are
they
yes
no
ca
do
it
ah
no
i
suppose
you
ca
well
it
was
really
at
best
only
a
joke
well
i
have
a
blanket
with
me
for
which
properly
speaking
i
have
no
longer
any
use
and
it
struck
me
that
you
might
take
it
off
my
hands
i
have
more
the
pity
a
whole
store
full
of
he
replied
and
when
i
had
opened
it
he
just
cast
one
glance
over
it
and
said
no
excuse
me
but
i
have
any
use
for
that
either
i
wanted
to
show
you
the
worse
side
first
said
i
it
much
better
on
the
other
side
ay
ay
it
no
good
i
wo
own
it
and
you
would
raise
a
penny
on
it
anywhere
no
it
clear
it
is
worth
anything
i
said
but
i
thought
it
might
go
with
another
old
blanket
at
an
auction
well
no
it
no
use
three
pence
said
i
no
i
wo
have
it
at
all
man
i
would
have
it
in
the
house
i
took
it
under
my
arm
and
went
home
i
acted
as
if
nothing
had
passed
spread
it
over
the
bed
again
smoothed
it
well
out
as
was
my
custom
and
tried
to
wipe
away
every
trace
of
my
late
action
i
could
not
possibly
have
been
in
my
right
mind
at
the
moment
when
i
came
to
the
conclusion
to
commit
this
rascally
trick
the
more
i
thought
over
it
the
more
unreasonable
it
seemed
to
me
it
must
have
been
an
attack
of
weakness
some
relaxation
in
my
inner
self
that
had
surprised
me
when
off
my
guard
neither
had
i
fallen
straight
into
the
trap
i
had
half
felt
that
i
was
going
the
wrong
road
and
i
expressly
offered
my
glasses
first
and
i
rejoiced
greatly
that
i
had
not
had
the
opportunity
of
carrying
into
effect
this
fault
which
would
have
sullied
the
last
hours
i
had
to
live
i
wandered
out
into
the
city
again
i
let
myself
sink
upon
one
of
the
seats
by
our
saviour
church
dozed
with
my
head
on
my
breast
apathetic
after
my
last
excitement
sick
and
famished
with
hunger
and
time
went
by
i
should
have
to
sit
out
this
hour
too
it
was
a
little
lighter
outside
than
in
the
house
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
chest
did
not
pain
quite
so
badly
out
in
the
open
air
i
should
get
home
too
soon
enough
and
i
dozed
and
thought
and
suffered
fearfully
i
had
found
a
little
pebble
i
wiped
it
clean
on
my
coat
sleeve
and
put
it
into
my
mouth
so
that
i
might
have
something
to
mumble
otherwise
i
did
not
stir
and
did
even
wink
an
eyelid
people
came
and
went
the
noise
of
cars
the
tramp
of
hoofs
and
chatter
of
tongues
filled
the
air
i
might
try
with
the
buttons
of
course
there
would
be
no
use
in
trying
and
besides
i
was
now
in
a
rather
bad
way
but
when
i
came
to
consider
the
matter
closely
i
would
be
obliged
as
it
were
to
pass
in
the
direction
of
my
uncle
as
i
went
home
at
last
i
got
up
dragging
myself
slowly
to
my
feet
and
reeled
down
the
streets
it
began
to
burn
over
my
eyebrows
fever
was
setting
in
and
i
hurried
as
fast
as
i
could
once
more
i
passed
the
baker
shop
where
the
little
loaf
lay
well
we
must
stop
here
i
said
with
affected
decision
but
supposing
i
were
to
go
in
and
beg
for
a
bit
of
bread
surely
that
was
a
fleeting
thought
a
flash
it
could
never
really
have
occurred
to
me
seriously
fie
i
whispered
to
myself
and
shook
my
head
and
held
on
my
way
in
rebslager
a
pair
of
lovers
stood
in
a
doorway
and
talked
together
softly
a
little
farther
up
a
girl
popped
her
head
out
of
a
window
i
walked
so
slowly
and
thoughtfully
that
i
looked
as
if
i
might
be
deep
in
meditation
on
nothing
in
particular
and
the
wench
came
out
into
the
street
how
is
the
world
treating
you
old
fellow
eh
what
are
you
ill
nay
the
lord
preserve
us
what
a
face
and
she
drew
away
frightened
i
pulled
up
at
once
what
amiss
with
my
face
had
i
really
begun
to
die
i
felt
over
my
cheeks
with
my
hand
thin
naturally
i
was
thin
my
cheeks
were
like
two
hollowed
bowls
but
lord
i
reeled
along
again
but
again
came
to
a
standstill
i
must
be
quite
inconceivably
thin
who
knows
but
that
my
eyes
were
sinking
right
into
my
head
how
did
i
look
in
reality
it
was
the
very
deuce
that
one
must
let
oneself
turn
into
a
living
deformity
for
sheer
hunger
sake
once
more
i
was
seized
by
fury
a
last
flaring
up
a
final
spasm
preserve
me
what
a
face
eh
here
i
was
with
a
head
that
could
be
matched
in
the
whole
country
with
a
pair
of
fists
that
by
the
lord
could
grind
a
navvy
into
finest
dust
and
yet
i
went
and
hungered
myself
into
a
deformity
right
in
the
town
of
christiania
was
there
any
rhyme
or
reason
in
that
i
had
sat
in
saddle
toiled
day
and
night
like
a
carrier
horse
i
had
read
my
eyes
out
of
their
sockets
had
starved
the
brains
out
of
my
head
and
what
the
devil
had
i
gained
by
it
even
a
street
hussy
prayed
god
to
deliver
her
from
the
sight
of
me
well
now
there
should
be
a
stop
to
it
do
you
understand
that
stop
it
shall
or
the
devil
take
a
worse
hold
of
me
with
steadily
increasing
fury
grinding
my
teeth
under
the
consciousness
of
my
impotence
with
tears
and
oaths
i
raged
on
without
looking
at
the
people
who
passed
me
by
i
commenced
once
more
to
martyr
myself
ran
my
forehead
against
on
purpose
dug
my
nails
deep
into
my
palms
bit
my
tongue
with
frenzy
when
it
did
articulate
clearly
and
laughed
insanely
each
time
it
hurt
much
yes
but
what
shall
i
do
i
asked
myself
at
last
and
i
stamped
many
times
on
the
pavement
and
repeated
what
shall
i
do
a
gentleman
just
going
by
remarks
with
a
smile
you
ought
to
go
and
ask
to
be
locked
up
i
looked
after
him
one
of
our
lady
doctors
nicknamed
the
duke
not
even
he
understood
my
real
condition
a
man
i
knew
whose
hand
i
had
shaken
i
grew
quiet
locked
up
yes
i
was
mad
he
was
right
i
felt
madness
in
my
blood
felt
its
darting
pain
through
my
brain
so
that
was
to
be
the
end
of
me
yes
yes
and
i
resume
my
wearisome
painful
walk
there
was
the
haven
in
which
i
was
to
find
rest
suddenly
i
stop
again
but
not
locked
up
i
say
not
that
and
i
grew
almost
hoarse
with
fear
i
implored
grace
for
myself
begged
to
the
wind
and
weather
not
to
be
locked
up
i
should
have
to
be
brought
to
the
again
imprisoned
in
a
dark
cell
which
had
not
a
spark
of
light
in
it
not
that
there
must
be
other
channels
yet
open
that
i
had
not
tried
and
i
would
try
them
i
would
be
so
earnestly
painstaking
would
take
good
time
for
it
and
go
indefatigably
round
from
house
to
house
for
example
there
was
cisler
the
i
had
been
to
him
at
all
some
remedy
would
turn
up
thus
i
stumbled
on
and
talked
until
i
brought
myself
to
weep
with
emotion
cisler
was
that
perchance
a
hint
from
on
high
his
name
had
struck
me
for
no
reason
and
he
lived
so
far
away
but
i
would
look
him
up
all
the
same
go
slowly
and
rest
between
times
i
knew
the
place
well
i
had
been
there
often
when
times
were
good
had
bought
much
music
from
him
should
i
ask
him
for
sixpence
perhaps
that
might
make
him
feel
uncomfortable
i
would
ask
him
for
a
shilling
i
went
into
the
shop
and
asked
for
the
chief
they
showed
me
into
his
office
there
he
sat
handsome
in
the
latest
style
running
down
some
accounts
i
stammered
through
an
excuse
and
set
forth
my
errand
compelled
by
need
to
apply
to
him
it
should
not
be
very
long
till
i
could
pay
it
back
when
i
got
paid
for
my
newspaper
article
he
would
confer
such
a
great
benefit
on
me
even
as
i
was
speaking
he
turned
about
to
his
desk
and
resumed
his
work
when
i
had
finished
he
glanced
sideways
at
me
shook
his
handsome
head
and
said
no
simply
no
no
explanation
not
another
word
my
knees
trembled
fearfully
and
i
supported
myself
against
the
little
polished
barrier
i
must
try
once
more
why
should
just
his
name
have
occurred
to
me
as
i
stood
far
away
from
there
in
vaterland
something
in
my
left
side
jerked
a
couple
of
times
and
i
broke
out
into
a
sweat
i
said
i
was
really
awfully
run
down
and
rather
ill
worse
luck
it
would
certainly
be
no
longer
than
a
few
days
when
i
could
repay
it
if
he
would
be
so
kind
my
dear
fellow
why
do
you
come
to
me
he
queried
you
are
a
perfect
stranger
off
the
street
to
me
go
to
the
paper
where
you
are
known
but
only
for
this
evening
said
i
the
office
is
already
shut
up
and
i
am
very
hungry
he
shook
his
head
persistently
kept
on
shaking
it
after
i
had
seized
the
handle
of
the
door
i
said
it
was
not
any
hint
from
on
high
thought
i
and
i
smiled
bitterly
if
it
came
to
that
i
could
give
as
good
a
hint
as
that
myself
i
dragged
on
one
block
after
the
other
now
and
then
i
rested
on
a
step
if
only
i
could
escape
being
locked
up
the
terror
of
that
cell
pursued
me
all
the
time
left
me
no
peace
whenever
i
caught
sight
of
a
policeman
in
my
path
i
staggered
into
a
side
street
to
avoid
meeting
him
now
then
we
will
count
a
hundred
steps
and
try
our
luck
again
there
must
be
a
remedy
sometime
it
was
a
little
a
place
in
which
i
had
never
before
set
foot
a
solitary
man
behind
the
counter
there
was
an
office
beyond
with
a
china
plate
on
the
door
was
arranging
things
on
the
shelves
and
counter
i
waited
till
the
last
customer
had
left
the
shop
a
young
lady
with
dimples
how
happy
she
looked
i
was
not
backward
in
trying
to
make
an
impression
with
the
pin
holding
my
coat
together
i
turned
and
my
chest
heaved
do
you
wish
for
anything
queried
the
shopman
is
the
chief
in
i
asked
he
is
gone
for
a
mountain
tour
in
jotunhejmen
he
replied
was
it
anything
very
particular
eh
it
concerns
a
couple
of
pence
for
food
i
said
and
i
tried
to
smile
i
am
hungry
and
have
a
fraction
then
you
just
about
as
rich
as
i
am
he
remarked
and
began
to
tidy
some
packages
of
wool
ah
do
turn
me
away
not
now
i
said
on
the
moment
with
a
cold
feeling
over
my
whole
body
i
am
really
nearly
dead
with
hunger
it
is
now
many
days
since
i
have
eaten
anything
with
perfect
gravity
without
saying
a
word
he
began
to
turn
his
pockets
inside
out
one
by
one
would
i
not
believe
him
upon
his
word
what
only
a
halfpenny
said
i
and
you
shall
have
a
penny
back
in
a
couple
of
days
my
dear
man
do
you
want
me
to
steal
out
of
the
till
he
queried
impatiently
yes
said
i
yes
take
a
halfpenny
out
of
the
till
it
wo
be
i
that
will
do
that
he
observed
adding
and
let
me
tell
you
at
the
same
time
i
had
about
enough
of
this
i
tore
myself
out
sick
with
hunger
and
boiling
with
shame
i
had
turned
myself
into
a
dog
for
the
sake
of
a
miserable
bone
and
i
had
not
got
it
nay
now
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
it
had
really
gone
all
too
far
with
me
i
had
held
myself
up
for
many
years
stood
erect
through
so
many
hard
hours
and
now
all
at
once
i
had
sunk
to
the
lowest
form
of
begging
this
one
day
had
coarsened
my
whole
mind
bespattered
my
soul
with
shamelessness
i
had
not
been
too
abashed
to
stand
and
whine
in
the
pettiest
huckster
shop
and
what
had
it
availed
me
but
was
i
not
then
without
the
veriest
atom
of
bread
to
put
inside
my
mouth
i
had
succeeded
in
rendering
myself
a
thing
loathsome
to
myself
yes
yes
but
it
must
come
to
an
end
presently
they
would
lock
the
outer
door
at
home
i
must
hurry
unless
i
wished
to
lie
in
the
again
this
gave
me
strength
lie
in
that
cell
again
i
would
not
with
body
bent
forward
and
my
hands
pressed
hard
against
my
left
ribs
to
deaden
the
stings
a
little
i
struggled
on
keeping
my
eyes
fastened
upon
the
that
i
might
not
be
forced
to
bow
to
possible
acquaintances
and
hastened
to
the
fire
god
be
praised
it
was
only
seven
by
the
dial
on
our
saviour
i
had
three
hours
yet
before
the
door
would
be
locked
what
a
fright
i
had
been
in
well
there
was
not
a
stone
left
unturned
i
had
done
all
i
could
to
think
that
i
really
could
not
succeed
once
in
a
whole
day
if
i
told
it
no
one
could
believe
it
if
i
were
to
write
it
down
they
would
say
i
had
invented
it
not
in
a
single
place
well
well
there
is
no
help
for
it
before
all
do
go
and
get
pathetic
again
bah
how
disgusting
i
can
assure
you
it
makes
me
have
a
loathing
for
you
if
all
hope
is
over
why
there
is
an
end
of
it
could
i
for
that
matter
steal
a
handful
of
oats
in
the
stable
a
streak
of
light
a
ray
yet
i
knew
the
stable
was
shut
i
took
my
ease
and
crept
home
at
a
slow
snail
pace
i
felt
thirsty
luckily
for
the
first
time
through
the
whole
day
and
i
went
and
sought
about
for
a
place
where
i
could
get
a
drink
i
was
a
long
distance
away
from
the
bazaar
and
i
would
not
ask
at
a
private
house
perhaps
though
i
could
wait
till
i
got
home
it
would
take
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
not
at
all
so
certain
that
i
could
keep
down
a
draught
of
water
either
my
stomach
no
longer
suffered
in
any
way
i
even
felt
nausea
at
the
spittle
i
swallowed
but
the
buttons
i
had
not
tried
the
buttons
at
all
yet
there
i
stood
and
commenced
to
smile
maybe
there
was
a
remedy
in
spite
of
all
i
was
totally
doomed
i
should
certainly
get
a
penny
for
them
tomorrow
i
might
raise
another
some
place
or
other
and
thursday
i
might
be
paid
for
my
newspaper
article
i
should
just
see
it
would
come
out
all
right
to
think
that
i
could
really
go
and
forget
the
buttons
i
took
them
out
of
my
pocket
and
inspected
them
as
i
walked
on
again
my
eyes
grew
dazed
with
joy
i
did
not
see
the
street
i
simply
went
on
did
i
know
exactly
the
big
my
refuge
in
the
dark
evenings
with
my
friend
one
by
one
my
possessions
had
vanished
there
my
little
things
from
home
my
last
book
i
liked
to
go
there
on
auction
days
to
look
on
and
rejoice
each
time
my
books
seemed
likely
to
fall
into
good
hands
magelsen
the
actor
had
my
watch
i
was
almost
proud
of
that
a
diary
in
which
i
had
written
my
first
small
poetical
attempt
had
been
bought
by
an
acquaintance
and
my
topcoat
had
found
a
haven
with
a
photographer
to
be
used
in
the
studio
so
there
was
no
cause
to
grumble
about
any
of
them
i
held
my
buttons
ready
in
my
hand
uncle
is
sitting
at
his
desk
writing
i
am
not
in
a
hurry
i
say
afraid
of
disturbing
him
and
making
him
impatient
at
my
application
my
voice
sounded
so
curiously
hollow
i
hardly
recognized
it
again
and
my
heart
beat
like
a
he
came
smilingly
over
to
me
as
was
his
wont
laid
both
his
hands
flat
on
the
counter
and
looked
at
my
face
without
saying
anything
yes
i
had
brought
something
of
which
i
would
ask
him
if
he
could
make
any
use
something
which
is
only
in
my
way
at
home
assure
you
of
it
are
quite
an
annoyance
some
buttons
well
what
then
what
was
there
about
the
buttons
and
he
thrusts
his
eyes
down
close
to
my
hand
could
he
give
me
a
couple
of
halfpence
for
them
whatever
he
thought
himself
quite
according
to
his
own
judgment
for
the
buttons
and
uncle
stares
astonishedly
at
me
for
these
buttons
only
for
a
cigar
or
whatever
he
liked
himself
i
was
just
passing
and
thought
i
would
look
in
upon
this
the
old
pawnbroker
burst
out
laughing
and
returned
to
his
desk
without
saying
a
word
there
i
stood
i
had
not
hoped
for
much
yet
all
the
same
i
had
thought
of
a
possibility
of
being
helped
this
laughter
was
my
it
could
i
suppose
be
of
any
use
trying
with
my
eyeglasses
either
of
course
i
would
let
my
glasses
go
in
with
them
that
was
a
matter
of
course
said
i
and
i
took
them
off
only
a
penny
or
if
he
wished
a
halfpenny
you
know
quite
well
i
ca
lend
you
anything
on
your
glasses
said
uncle
i
told
you
that
once
before
but
i
want
a
stamp
i
said
dully
i
ca
even
send
off
the
letters
i
have
written
a
penny
or
a
halfpenny
stamp
just
as
you
will
oh
god
help
you
go
your
way
he
replied
and
motioned
me
off
with
his
hands
yes
yes
well
it
must
be
so
i
said
to
myself
mechanically
i
put
on
my
glasses
again
took
the
buttons
in
my
hand
and
turning
away
bade
him
and
closed
the
door
after
me
as
usual
well
now
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
to
think
he
would
not
take
them
at
any
price
i
muttered
they
are
almost
new
buttons
i
ca
understand
it
whilst
i
stood
lost
in
thought
a
man
passed
by
and
entered
the
office
he
had
given
me
a
little
shove
in
his
hurry
we
both
made
excuses
and
i
turned
round
and
looked
after
him
what
is
that
you
he
said
suddenly
when
up
the
steps
he
came
back
and
i
recognized
him
god
bless
me
man
what
on
earth
do
you
look
like
what
were
you
doing
in
there
oh
i
had
business
you
are
going
in
too
i
see
yes
what
were
you
in
with
my
knees
trembled
i
supported
myself
against
the
wall
and
stretched
out
my
hand
with
the
buttons
in
it
what
the
deuce
he
cried
no
this
is
really
going
too
far
said
i
and
was
about
to
go
i
felt
the
tears
choking
my
breast
no
wait
a
minute
he
said
what
was
i
to
wait
for
was
he
not
himself
on
the
road
to
my
uncle
bringing
perhaps
his
engagement
ring
had
been
hungry
perhaps
for
several
days
owed
his
landlady
yes
i
replied
if
you
will
be
out
soon
of
course
he
broke
in
seizing
hold
of
my
arm
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
do
believe
you
you
are
such
an
idiot
that
it
better
you
come
in
along
with
me
i
understood
what
he
meant
suddenly
felt
a
little
spark
of
pride
and
answered
i
ca
i
promised
to
be
in
bernt
akers
street
at
seven
and
seven
quite
so
but
it
eight
now
here
i
am
standing
with
the
watch
in
my
hand
that
i
going
to
pawn
so
in
with
you
you
hungry
sinner
i
get
you
five
shillings
anyhow
and
he
pushed
me
in
part
iii
a
week
passed
in
glory
and
gladness
i
had
got
over
the
worst
this
time
too
i
had
had
food
every
day
and
my
courage
rose
and
i
thrust
one
iron
after
the
other
into
the
fire
i
was
working
at
three
or
four
articles
that
plundered
my
poor
brain
of
every
spark
every
thought
that
rose
in
it
and
yet
i
fancied
that
i
wrote
with
more
facility
than
before
the
last
article
with
which
i
had
raced
about
so
much
and
upon
which
i
had
built
such
hopes
had
already
been
returned
to
me
by
the
editor
and
angry
and
wounded
as
i
was
i
had
destroyed
it
immediately
without
even
it
again
in
future
i
would
try
another
paper
in
order
to
open
up
more
fields
for
my
work
supposing
that
writing
were
to
fail
and
the
worst
were
to
come
to
the
worst
i
still
had
the
ships
to
take
to
the
lay
alongside
the
wharf
ready
to
sail
and
i
might
perhaps
work
my
way
out
to
archangel
or
wherever
else
she
might
be
bound
there
was
no
lack
of
openings
on
many
sides
the
last
crisis
had
dealt
rather
roughly
with
me
my
hair
fell
out
in
masses
and
i
was
much
troubled
with
headaches
particularly
in
the
morning
and
my
nervousness
died
a
hard
death
i
sat
and
wrote
during
the
day
with
my
hands
bound
up
in
rags
simply
because
i
could
not
endure
the
touch
of
my
own
breath
upon
them
if
jens
olaj
banged
the
stable
door
underneath
me
or
if
a
dog
came
into
the
yard
and
commenced
to
bark
it
thrilled
through
my
very
marrow
like
icy
stabs
piercing
me
from
every
side
i
was
pretty
well
played
out
day
after
day
i
strove
at
my
work
begrudging
myself
the
short
time
it
took
to
swallow
my
food
before
i
sat
down
again
to
write
at
this
time
both
the
bed
and
the
little
rickety
table
were
strewn
over
with
notes
and
written
pages
upon
which
i
worked
turn
about
added
any
new
ideas
which
might
have
occurred
to
me
during
the
day
erased
or
quickened
here
and
there
the
dull
points
by
a
word
of
colour
fagged
and
toiled
at
sentence
after
sentence
with
the
greatest
of
pains
one
afternoon
one
of
my
articles
being
at
length
finished
i
thrust
it
contented
and
happy
into
my
pocket
and
betook
myself
to
the
commandor
it
was
high
time
i
made
some
arrangement
towards
getting
a
little
money
again
i
had
only
a
few
pence
left
the
commandor
requested
me
to
sit
down
for
a
moment
he
would
be
disengaged
immediately
and
he
continued
writing
i
looked
about
the
little
office
busts
prints
cuttings
and
an
enormous
that
looked
as
if
it
might
swallow
a
man
bones
and
all
i
felt
sad
at
heart
at
the
sight
of
this
monstrous
chasm
this
dragon
mouth
that
always
stood
open
always
ready
to
receive
rejected
work
newly
crushed
hopes
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
queried
the
commandor
from
the
table
the
i
reply
pleased
that
i
can
be
of
service
to
him
the
and
he
continues
writing
at
last
he
encloses
a
couple
of
letters
in
their
envelopes
tosses
some
papers
into
the
basket
and
lays
down
his
pen
then
he
swings
round
on
his
chair
and
looks
at
me
observing
that
i
am
still
standing
near
the
door
he
makes
a
motion
with
his
hand
and
points
to
a
chair
i
turn
aside
so
that
he
may
not
see
that
i
have
no
waistcoat
on
when
i
open
my
coat
to
take
the
manuscript
out
of
my
pocket
it
is
only
a
little
character
sketch
of
correggio
i
say
but
perhaps
it
is
worse
luck
not
written
in
such
a
way
that
he
takes
the
papers
out
of
my
hand
and
commences
to
go
through
them
his
face
is
turned
towards
me
and
so
it
is
thus
he
looks
at
close
quarters
this
man
whose
name
i
had
already
heard
in
my
earliest
youth
and
whose
paper
had
exercised
the
greatest
influence
upon
me
as
the
years
advanced
his
hair
is
curly
and
his
beautiful
brown
eyes
are
a
little
restless
he
has
a
habit
of
tweaking
his
nose
now
and
then
no
scotch
minister
could
look
milder
than
this
truculent
writer
whose
pen
always
left
bleeding
scars
wherever
it
attacked
a
peculiar
feeling
of
awe
and
admiration
comes
over
me
in
the
presence
of
this
man
the
tears
are
on
the
point
of
coming
to
my
eyes
and
i
advanced
a
step
to
tell
him
how
heartily
i
appreciated
him
for
all
he
had
taught
me
and
to
beg
him
not
to
hurt
me
i
was
only
a
poor
bungling
wretch
who
had
had
a
sorry
enough
time
of
it
as
it
was
he
looked
up
and
placed
my
manuscript
slowly
together
whilst
he
sat
and
considered
to
make
it
easier
for
him
to
give
me
a
refusal
i
stretch
out
my
hand
a
little
and
say
ah
well
of
course
it
is
not
of
any
use
to
you
and
i
smile
to
give
him
the
impression
that
i
take
it
easily
everything
has
to
be
of
such
a
popular
nature
to
be
of
any
use
to
us
he
replies
you
know
the
kind
of
public
we
have
but
ca
you
try
and
write
something
a
little
more
commonplace
or
hit
upon
something
that
people
understand
better
his
forbearance
astonishes
me
i
understand
that
my
article
is
rejected
and
yet
i
could
not
have
received
a
prettier
refusal
not
to
take
up
his
time
any
longer
i
reply
oh
yes
i
daresay
i
can
i
go
towards
the
door
hem
he
must
pray
forgive
me
for
having
taken
up
his
time
with
this
i
bow
and
turn
the
door
handle
if
you
need
it
he
says
you
are
welcome
to
draw
a
little
in
advance
you
can
write
for
it
you
know
now
as
he
had
just
seen
that
i
was
not
capable
of
writing
this
offer
humiliated
me
somewhat
and
i
answered
no
thanks
i
can
pull
through
yet
a
while
thanking
you
very
much
all
the
same
replies
the
commandor
turning
at
the
same
time
to
his
desk
again
he
had
none
the
less
treated
me
with
undeserved
kindness
and
i
was
grateful
to
him
for
it
and
i
would
know
how
to
appreciate
it
too
i
made
a
resolution
not
to
return
to
him
until
i
could
take
something
with
me
that
satisfied
me
perfectly
something
that
would
astonish
the
commandor
a
bit
and
make
him
order
me
to
be
paid
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
went
home
and
tackled
my
writing
once
more
during
the
following
evenings
as
soon
as
it
got
near
eight
and
the
gas
was
lit
the
following
thing
happened
regularly
to
me
as
i
come
out
of
my
room
to
take
a
walk
in
the
streets
after
the
labour
and
troubles
of
the
day
a
lady
dressed
in
black
stands
under
the
exactly
opposite
my
door
she
turns
her
face
towards
me
and
follows
me
with
her
eyes
when
i
pass
her
by
i
remark
that
she
always
has
the
same
dress
on
always
the
same
thick
veil
that
conceals
her
face
and
falls
over
her
breast
and
that
she
carries
in
her
hand
a
small
umbrella
with
an
ivory
ring
in
the
handle
this
was
already
the
third
evening
i
had
seen
her
there
always
in
the
same
place
as
soon
as
i
have
passed
her
by
she
turns
slowly
and
goes
down
the
street
away
from
me
my
nervous
brain
vibrated
with
curiosity
and
i
became
at
once
possessed
by
the
unreasonable
feeling
that
i
was
the
object
of
her
visit
at
last
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
addressing
her
of
asking
her
if
she
was
looking
for
any
one
if
she
needed
my
assistance
in
any
way
or
if
i
might
accompany
her
home
badly
dressed
as
i
unfortunately
was
i
might
protect
her
through
the
dark
streets
but
i
had
an
undefined
fear
that
it
perhaps
might
cost
me
something
a
glass
of
wine
or
a
drive
and
i
had
no
money
left
at
all
my
distressingly
empty
pockets
acted
in
a
far
too
depressing
way
upon
me
and
i
had
not
even
the
courage
to
scrutinize
her
sharply
as
i
passed
her
by
hunger
had
once
more
taken
up
its
abode
in
my
breast
and
i
had
not
tasted
food
since
yesterday
evening
this
is
true
was
not
a
long
period
i
had
often
been
able
to
hold
out
for
a
couple
of
days
at
a
time
but
latterly
i
had
commenced
to
fall
off
seriously
i
could
not
go
hungry
one
quarter
as
well
as
i
used
to
do
a
single
day
made
me
feel
dazed
and
i
suffered
from
perpetual
retching
the
moment
i
tasted
water
added
to
this
was
the
fact
that
i
lay
and
shivered
all
night
lay
fully
dressed
as
i
stood
and
walked
in
the
daytime
lay
blue
with
cold
lay
and
froze
every
night
with
fits
of
icy
shivering
and
grew
stiff
during
my
sleep
the
old
blanket
could
not
keep
out
the
draughts
and
i
woke
in
the
mornings
with
my
nose
stopped
by
the
sharp
outside
frosty
air
which
forced
its
way
into
the
dilapidated
room
i
go
down
the
street
and
think
over
what
i
am
to
do
to
keep
myself
alive
until
i
get
my
next
article
finished
if
i
only
had
a
candle
i
would
try
to
fag
on
through
the
night
it
would
only
take
a
couple
of
hours
if
i
once
warmed
to
my
work
and
then
tomorrow
i
could
call
on
the
commandor
i
go
without
further
ado
into
the
opland
cafe
and
look
for
my
young
acquaintance
in
the
bank
in
order
to
procure
a
penny
for
a
candle
i
passed
unhindered
through
all
the
rooms
i
passed
a
dozen
tables
at
which
men
sat
chatting
eating
and
drinking
i
passed
into
the
back
of
the
cafe
ay
even
into
the
red
alcove
without
succeeding
in
finding
my
man
crestfallen
and
annoyed
i
dragged
myself
out
again
into
the
street
and
took
the
direction
to
the
palace
was
it
now
the
very
hottest
eternal
devil
existing
to
think
that
my
hardships
never
would
come
to
an
end
taking
long
furious
strides
with
the
collar
of
my
coat
hunched
savagely
up
round
my
ears
and
my
hands
thrust
in
my
breeches
pockets
i
strode
along
cursing
my
unlucky
stars
the
whole
way
not
one
real
untroubled
hour
in
seven
or
eight
months
not
the
common
food
necessary
to
hold
body
and
soul
together
for
the
space
of
one
short
week
before
want
stared
me
in
the
face
again
here
i
had
into
the
bargain
gone
and
kept
straight
and
honourable
all
through
my
misery
ha
ha
straight
and
honourable
to
the
heart
core
god
preserve
me
what
a
fool
i
had
been
and
i
commenced
to
tell
myself
how
i
had
even
gone
about
because
i
had
once
brought
hans
pauli
blanket
to
the
i
laughed
sarcastically
at
my
delicate
rectitude
spat
contemptuously
in
the
street
and
could
not
find
words
half
strong
enough
to
mock
myself
for
my
stupidity
let
it
only
happen
now
were
i
to
find
at
this
moment
a
schoolgirl
savings
or
a
poor
widow
only
penny
i
would
snatch
it
up
and
pocket
it
steal
it
deliberately
and
sleep
the
whole
night
through
like
a
top
i
had
not
suffered
so
unspeakably
much
for
nothing
my
patience
was
gone
i
was
prepared
to
do
anything
i
walked
round
the
palace
three
perhaps
four
times
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
would
go
home
took
yet
one
little
turn
in
the
park
and
went
back
down
carl
johann
it
was
now
about
eleven
the
streets
were
fairly
dark
and
the
people
roamed
about
in
all
directions
quiet
pairs
and
noisy
groups
mixed
with
one
another
the
great
hour
had
commenced
the
pairing
time
when
the
mystic
traffic
is
in
full
swing
and
the
hour
of
merry
adventures
sets
in
rustling
petticoats
one
or
two
still
short
sensual
laughter
heaving
bosoms
passionate
panting
breaths
and
far
down
near
the
grand
hotel
a
voice
calling
emma
the
whole
street
was
a
swamp
from
which
hot
vapours
exuded
i
feel
involuntarily
in
my
pockets
for
a
few
shillings
the
passion
that
thrills
through
the
movements
of
every
one
of
the
the
dim
light
of
the
gas
lamps
the
quiet
pregnant
night
all
commence
to
affect
me
this
air
that
is
laden
with
whispers
embraces
trembling
admissions
concessions
words
and
suppressed
cries
a
number
of
cats
are
declaring
their
love
with
loud
yells
in
doorway
and
i
did
not
possess
even
a
florin
it
was
a
misery
a
wretchedness
without
parallel
to
be
so
impoverished
what
humiliation
too
what
disgrace
i
began
again
to
think
about
the
poor
widow
last
mite
that
i
would
have
stolen
a
schoolboy
cap
or
handkerchief
or
a
beggar
wallet
that
i
would
have
brought
to
a
without
more
ado
and
caroused
with
the
proceeds
in
order
to
console
myself
to
indemnify
myself
in
some
measure
i
take
to
picking
all
possible
faults
in
the
people
who
glide
by
i
shrug
my
shoulders
contemptuously
and
look
slightingly
at
them
according
as
they
pass
these
students
who
fancy
they
are
sowing
their
wild
oats
in
truly
continental
style
if
they
tickle
a
sempstress
under
the
ribs
these
young
bucks
bank
clerks
merchants
flâneurs
who
would
not
disdain
a
sailor
wife
blowsy
molls
ready
to
fall
down
in
the
first
doorway
for
a
glass
of
beer
what
sirens
the
place
at
their
side
still
warm
from
the
last
night
embrace
of
a
or
a
the
throne
always
vacant
always
open
to
newcomers
pray
mount
i
spat
out
over
the
pavement
without
troubling
if
it
hit
any
one
i
felt
enraged
filled
with
contempt
for
these
people
who
scraped
acquaintanceship
with
one
another
and
paired
off
right
before
my
eyes
i
lifted
my
head
and
felt
in
myself
the
blessing
of
being
able
to
keep
my
own
sty
clean
at
stortingsplads
parliament
place
i
met
a
girl
who
looked
fixedly
at
me
as
i
came
close
to
her
said
i
she
stopped
hum
was
she
out
walking
so
late
did
not
a
young
lady
run
rather
a
risk
in
being
in
carl
johann
at
this
time
of
night
really
not
yes
but
was
she
never
spoken
to
molested
i
meant
to
speak
plainly
asked
to
go
along
home
with
any
one
she
stared
at
me
with
astonishment
scanned
my
face
closely
to
see
what
i
really
meant
by
this
then
thrust
her
hand
suddenly
under
my
arm
and
said
yes
and
we
went
too
i
walked
on
with
her
but
when
we
had
gone
a
few
paces
past
the
i
came
to
a
standstill
freed
my
arm
and
said
listen
my
dear
i
do
own
a
farthing
and
with
that
i
went
on
at
first
she
would
not
believe
me
but
after
she
had
searched
all
my
pockets
and
found
nothing
she
got
vexed
tossed
her
head
and
called
me
a
dry
cod
said
i
wait
a
minute
she
called
are
those
eyeglasses
that
you
got
gold
no
then
go
to
blazes
with
you
and
i
went
a
few
seconds
after
she
came
running
behind
me
and
called
out
to
me
you
can
come
with
me
all
the
same
i
felt
humiliated
by
this
offer
from
an
unfortunate
street
wench
and
i
said
no
besides
it
was
growing
late
at
night
and
i
was
due
at
a
place
neither
could
she
afford
to
make
sacrifices
of
that
kind
yes
but
now
i
will
have
you
come
with
me
but
i
wo
go
with
you
in
this
way
oh
naturally
you
are
going
with
some
one
else
no
i
answered
but
i
was
conscious
that
i
stood
in
a
sorry
plight
in
face
of
this
unique
street
jade
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
save
appearances
at
least
what
is
your
name
i
inquired
mary
eh
well
listen
to
me
now
mary
and
i
set
about
explaining
my
behaviour
the
girl
grew
more
and
more
astonished
in
measure
as
i
proceeded
had
she
then
believed
that
i
too
was
one
of
those
who
went
about
the
street
at
night
and
ran
after
little
girls
did
she
really
think
so
badly
of
me
had
i
perhaps
said
anything
rude
to
her
from
the
beginning
did
one
behave
as
i
had
done
when
one
was
actuated
by
any
bad
motive
briefly
in
so
many
words
i
had
accosted
her
and
accompanied
her
those
few
paces
to
see
how
far
she
would
go
on
with
it
for
the
rest
my
name
was
pastor
depart
and
sin
no
more
with
these
words
i
left
her
i
rubbed
my
hands
with
delight
over
my
happy
notion
and
soliloquized
aloud
what
a
joy
there
is
in
going
about
doing
good
actions
perhaps
i
had
given
this
fallen
creature
an
upward
impulse
for
her
whole
life
save
her
once
for
all
from
destruction
and
she
would
appreciate
it
when
she
came
to
think
over
it
remember
me
yet
in
her
hour
of
death
with
thankful
heart
ah
in
truth
it
paid
to
be
honourable
upright
and
righteous
my
spirits
were
effervescing
i
felt
fresh
and
courageous
enough
to
face
anything
that
might
turn
up
if
i
only
had
a
candle
i
might
perhaps
complete
my
article
i
walked
on
jingling
my
new
in
my
hand
hummed
and
whistled
and
speculated
as
to
means
of
procuring
a
candle
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
it
i
would
have
to
take
my
writing
materials
with
me
into
the
street
under
a
i
opened
the
door
and
went
up
to
get
my
papers
when
i
descended
once
more
i
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
and
planted
myself
under
the
light
all
around
was
quiet
i
heard
the
heavy
clanking
footstep
of
a
constable
down
in
taergade
and
far
away
in
the
direction
of
hill
a
dog
barked
there
was
nothing
to
disturb
me
i
pulled
my
coat
collar
up
round
my
ears
and
commenced
to
think
with
all
my
might
it
would
be
such
an
extraordinary
help
to
me
if
i
were
lucky
enough
to
find
a
suitable
winding
up
for
this
little
essay
i
had
stuck
just
at
a
rather
difficult
point
in
it
where
there
ought
to
be
a
quite
imperceptible
transition
to
something
fresh
then
a
subdued
gliding
finale
a
prolonged
murmur
ending
at
last
in
a
climax
as
bold
and
as
startling
as
a
shot
or
the
sound
of
a
mountain
avalanche
full
stop
but
the
words
would
not
come
to
me
i
read
over
the
whole
piece
from
the
commencement
read
every
sentence
aloud
and
yet
failed
absolutely
to
crystallize
my
thoughts
in
order
to
produce
this
scintillating
climax
and
into
the
bargain
whilst
i
was
standing
labouring
away
at
this
the
constable
came
and
planting
himself
a
little
distance
away
from
me
spoilt
my
whole
mood
now
what
concern
was
it
of
his
if
i
stood
and
strove
for
a
striking
climax
to
an
article
for
the
lord
how
utterly
impossible
it
was
for
me
to
keep
my
head
above
water
no
matter
how
much
i
tried
i
stayed
there
for
the
space
of
an
hour
the
constable
went
his
way
the
cold
began
to
get
too
intense
for
me
to
keep
still
disheartened
and
despondent
over
this
abortive
effort
i
opened
the
door
again
and
went
up
to
my
room
it
was
cold
up
there
and
i
could
barely
see
my
window
for
the
intense
darkness
i
felt
my
towards
the
bed
pulled
off
my
shoes
and
set
about
warming
my
feet
between
my
hands
then
i
lay
down
as
i
had
done
for
a
long
time
now
with
all
my
clothes
on
the
following
morning
i
sat
up
in
bed
as
soon
as
it
got
light
and
set
to
work
at
the
essay
once
more
i
sat
thus
till
noon
i
had
succeeded
by
then
in
getting
ten
perhaps
twenty
lines
down
and
still
i
had
not
found
an
ending
i
rose
put
on
my
shoes
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
to
try
and
warm
myself
i
looked
out
there
was
rime
on
the
window
it
was
snowing
down
in
the
yard
a
thick
layer
of
snow
covered
the
and
the
top
of
the
pump
i
bustled
about
the
room
took
aimless
turns
to
and
fro
scratched
the
wall
with
my
nail
leant
my
head
carefully
against
the
door
for
a
while
tapped
with
my
forefinger
on
the
floor
and
then
listened
attentively
all
without
any
object
but
quietly
and
pensively
as
if
it
were
some
matter
of
importance
in
which
i
was
engaged
and
all
the
while
i
murmured
aloud
time
upon
time
so
that
i
could
hear
my
own
voice
but
great
god
surely
this
is
madness
and
yet
i
kept
on
just
as
before
after
a
long
time
perhaps
a
couple
of
hours
i
pulled
myself
sharply
together
bit
my
lips
and
manned
myself
as
well
as
i
could
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
i
found
a
splinter
to
chew
and
set
myself
resolutely
to
again
a
couple
of
short
sentences
formed
themselves
with
much
trouble
a
score
of
poor
words
which
i
tortured
forth
with
might
and
main
to
try
and
advance
a
little
then
i
stopped
my
head
was
barren
i
was
incapable
of
more
and
as
i
could
positively
not
go
on
i
set
myself
to
gaze
with
wide
open
eyes
at
these
last
words
this
unfinished
sheet
of
paper
i
stared
at
these
strange
shaky
letters
that
bristled
up
from
the
paper
like
small
hairy
creeping
things
till
at
last
i
could
neither
make
head
nor
tail
of
any
of
it
i
thought
on
nothing
time
went
i
heard
the
traffic
in
the
street
the
rattle
of
cars
and
tramp
of
hoofs
jens
olaj
voice
ascended
towards
me
from
the
stables
as
he
chid
the
horses
i
was
perfectly
stunned
i
sat
and
moistened
my
lips
a
little
but
otherwise
made
no
effort
to
do
anything
my
chest
was
in
a
pitiful
state
the
dusk
closed
in
i
sank
more
and
more
together
grew
weary
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
again
in
order
to
warm
my
fingers
a
little
i
stroked
them
through
my
hair
backwards
and
forwards
and
crosswise
small
loose
tufts
came
away
flakes
that
got
between
my
fingers
and
scattered
over
the
pillow
i
did
not
think
anything
about
it
just
then
it
was
as
if
it
did
not
concern
me
i
had
hair
enough
left
anyway
i
tried
afresh
to
shake
myself
out
of
this
strange
daze
that
enveloped
my
whole
being
like
a
mist
i
sat
up
struck
my
knees
with
my
flat
hands
laughed
as
hard
as
my
sore
chest
permitted
me
only
to
collapse
again
naught
availed
i
was
dying
helplessly
with
my
eyes
wide
open
staring
straight
up
at
the
roof
at
length
i
stuck
my
forefinger
in
my
mouth
and
took
to
sucking
it
something
stirred
in
my
brain
a
thought
that
bored
its
way
in
there
a
notion
supposing
i
were
to
take
a
bite
and
without
a
moment
reflection
i
shut
my
eyes
and
clenched
my
teeth
on
it
i
sprang
up
at
last
i
was
thoroughly
awake
a
little
blood
trickled
from
it
and
i
licked
it
as
it
came
it
did
hurt
very
much
neither
was
the
wound
large
but
i
was
brought
at
one
bound
to
my
senses
i
shook
my
head
went
to
the
window
where
i
found
a
rag
and
wound
it
round
the
sore
place
as
i
stood
and
busied
myself
with
this
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
cried
softly
to
myself
this
poor
thin
finger
looked
so
utterly
pitiable
god
in
heaven
what
a
pass
it
had
come
to
now
with
me
the
gloom
grew
closer
it
was
maybe
not
impossible
that
i
might
work
up
my
finale
through
the
course
of
the
evening
if
i
only
had
a
candle
my
head
was
clear
once
more
thoughts
came
and
went
as
usual
and
i
did
not
suffer
particularly
i
did
not
even
feel
hunger
so
badly
as
some
hours
previously
i
could
hold
out
well
till
the
next
day
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
get
a
candle
on
credit
if
i
applied
to
the
provision
shop
and
explained
my
situation
i
was
so
well
known
in
there
in
the
good
old
days
when
i
had
the
means
to
do
it
i
used
to
buy
many
a
loaf
there
there
was
no
doubt
i
could
raise
a
candle
on
the
strength
of
my
honest
name
and
for
the
first
time
for
ages
i
took
to
brushing
my
clothes
a
little
got
rid
as
well
as
the
darkness
allowed
me
of
the
loose
hairs
on
my
collar
and
felt
my
way
down
the
stairs
when
i
got
outside
in
the
street
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
perhaps
rather
ask
for
a
loaf
i
grew
irresolute
and
stopped
to
consider
on
no
account
i
replied
to
myself
at
last
i
was
unfortunately
not
in
a
condition
to
bear
food
it
would
only
be
a
repetition
of
the
same
old
story
visions
and
presentiments
and
mad
notions
my
article
would
never
get
finished
and
it
was
a
question
of
going
to
the
commandor
before
he
had
time
to
forget
me
on
no
account
whatever
and
i
decided
upon
the
candle
with
that
i
entered
the
shop
a
woman
is
standing
at
the
counter
making
purchases
several
small
parcels
in
different
sorts
of
paper
are
lying
in
front
of
her
the
shopman
who
knows
me
and
knows
what
i
usually
buy
leaves
the
woman
and
packs
without
much
ado
a
loaf
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
shoves
it
over
to
me
no
thank
you
it
was
really
a
candle
i
wanted
this
evening
i
say
i
say
it
very
quietly
and
humbly
in
order
not
to
vex
him
and
spoil
my
chance
of
getting
what
i
want
my
answer
confuses
him
he
turns
quite
cross
at
my
unexpected
words
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
demanded
anything
but
a
loaf
from
him
well
then
you
must
wait
a
while
he
says
at
last
and
busies
himself
with
the
woman
parcels
again
she
receives
her
wares
and
pays
for
them
him
a
florin
out
of
which
she
gets
the
change
and
goes
out
now
the
and
i
are
alone
he
says
so
it
was
a
candle
you
wanted
eh
he
tears
open
a
package
and
takes
one
out
for
me
he
looks
at
me
and
i
look
at
him
i
ca
get
my
request
over
my
lips
oh
yes
that
true
you
paid
though
he
says
suddenly
he
simply
asserts
that
i
had
paid
i
heard
every
word
and
he
begins
to
count
some
silver
out
of
the
till
coin
after
coin
shining
stout
pieces
he
gives
me
back
change
for
a
crown
much
obliged
he
says
now
i
stand
and
look
at
these
pieces
of
money
for
a
second
i
am
conscious
something
is
wrong
somewhere
i
do
not
reflect
do
not
think
about
anything
at
all
i
am
simply
struck
of
a
heap
by
all
this
wealth
which
is
lying
glittering
before
my
eyes
and
i
gather
up
the
money
mechanically
i
stand
outside
the
counter
stupid
with
amazement
dumb
paralyzed
i
take
a
stride
towards
the
door
and
stop
again
i
turn
my
eyes
upon
a
certain
spot
in
the
wall
where
a
little
bell
is
suspended
to
a
leather
collar
and
underneath
this
a
bundle
of
string
and
i
stand
and
stare
at
these
things
the
is
struck
by
the
idea
that
i
want
to
have
a
chat
as
i
take
my
time
so
leisurely
and
says
as
he
tidies
a
lot
of
strewn
over
the
counter
it
looks
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
winter
snow
humph
yes
i
reply
it
looks
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
winter
in
earnest
now
it
looks
like
it
and
a
while
after
i
add
ah
well
it
is
none
too
soon
i
could
hear
myself
speak
but
each
word
i
uttered
struck
my
ear
as
if
it
were
coming
from
another
person
i
spoke
absolutely
unwittingly
involuntarily
without
being
conscious
of
myself
oh
do
you
think
so
says
the
boy
i
thrust
the
hand
with
the
money
into
my
pocket
turned
the
and
left
i
could
hear
that
i
said
and
that
the
replied
to
me
i
had
gone
a
few
paces
away
from
the
shop
when
the
was
torn
open
and
the
boy
called
after
me
i
turned
round
without
any
astonishment
without
a
trace
of
fear
i
only
collected
the
money
into
my
hand
and
prepared
to
give
it
back
beg
pardon
you
forgotten
your
candle
says
the
boy
ah
thanks
i
answered
quietly
thanks
thanks
and
i
strolled
on
down
the
street
bearing
it
in
my
hand
my
first
sensible
thought
referred
to
the
money
i
went
over
to
a
counted
it
weighed
it
in
my
hand
and
smiled
so
in
spite
of
all
i
was
helped
extraordinarily
grandly
incredibly
helped
helped
for
a
long
long
time
and
i
thrust
my
hand
with
the
money
into
my
pocket
and
walked
on
outside
an
in
grand
street
i
stopped
and
turned
over
in
my
mind
calmly
and
quietly
if
i
should
venture
so
soon
to
take
a
little
refreshment
i
could
hear
the
rattle
of
knives
and
plates
inside
and
the
sound
of
meat
being
pounded
the
temptation
was
too
strong
for
me
i
entered
a
helping
of
beef
i
say
one
beef
calls
the
waitress
down
through
the
door
to
the
lift
i
sat
down
by
myself
at
a
little
table
next
to
the
door
and
prepared
to
wait
it
was
somewhat
dark
where
i
was
sitting
and
i
felt
tolerably
well
concealed
and
set
myself
to
have
a
serious
think
every
now
and
then
the
waitress
glanced
over
at
me
inquiringly
my
first
downright
dishonesty
was
accomplished
my
first
theft
compared
to
this
all
my
earlier
escapades
were
as
nothing
my
first
great
fall
well
and
good
there
was
no
help
for
it
for
that
matter
it
was
open
to
me
to
settle
it
with
the
shopkeeper
later
on
on
a
more
opportune
occasion
it
need
not
go
any
farther
with
me
besides
that
i
had
not
taken
upon
myself
to
live
more
honourably
than
all
the
other
folk
there
was
no
contract
that
do
you
think
that
beef
will
soon
be
here
yes
immediately
the
waitress
opens
the
trapdoor
and
looks
down
into
the
kitchen
but
suppose
the
affair
did
crop
up
some
day
if
the
were
to
get
suspicious
and
begin
to
think
over
the
transaction
about
the
bread
and
the
florin
of
which
the
woman
got
the
change
it
was
not
impossible
that
he
would
discover
it
some
day
perhaps
the
next
time
i
went
there
well
then
lord
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
unobserved
if
you
please
says
the
waitress
kindly
placing
the
beef
on
the
table
would
you
rather
go
to
another
compartment
it
so
dark
here
no
thanks
just
let
me
be
here
i
reply
her
kindliness
touches
me
at
once
i
pay
for
the
beef
on
the
spot
put
whatever
change
remains
into
her
hand
close
her
fingers
over
it
she
smiles
and
i
say
in
fun
with
the
tears
near
my
ears
there
you
to
have
the
balance
to
buy
yourself
a
farm
ah
you
very
welcome
to
it
i
commenced
to
eat
got
more
and
more
greedy
i
as
i
did
so
swallowed
whole
pieces
without
chewing
them
enjoyed
myself
in
an
way
at
every
mouthful
and
tore
at
the
meat
like
a
cannibal
the
waitress
came
over
to
me
again
will
you
have
anything
to
drink
she
asks
bending
down
a
little
towards
me
i
looked
at
her
she
spoke
very
low
almost
shyly
and
dropped
her
eyes
i
mean
a
glass
of
ale
or
whatever
you
like
best
from
me
without
that
is
if
you
will
no
many
thanks
i
answer
not
now
i
shall
come
back
another
time
she
drew
back
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
i
could
only
see
her
head
what
a
singular
creature
when
finished
i
made
at
once
for
the
door
i
felt
nausea
already
the
waitress
got
up
i
was
afraid
to
go
near
the
light
afraid
to
show
myself
too
plainly
to
the
young
girl
who
never
for
a
moment
suspected
the
depth
of
my
misery
so
i
wished
her
a
hasty
bowed
to
her
and
left
the
food
commenced
to
take
effect
i
suffered
much
from
it
and
could
not
keep
it
down
for
any
length
of
time
i
had
to
empty
my
mouth
a
little
at
every
dark
corner
i
came
to
i
struggled
to
master
this
nausea
which
threatened
to
hollow
me
out
anew
clenched
my
hands
and
tried
to
fight
it
down
stamped
on
the
pavement
and
gulped
down
furiously
whatever
sought
to
come
up
all
in
vain
i
sprang
at
last
into
a
doorway
doubled
up
head
foremost
blinded
with
the
water
which
gushed
from
my
eyes
and
vomited
once
more
i
was
seized
with
bitterness
and
wept
as
i
went
along
the
street
i
cursed
the
cruel
powers
whoever
they
might
be
that
persecuted
me
so
consigned
them
to
hell
damnation
and
eternal
torments
for
their
petty
persecution
there
was
but
little
chivalry
in
fate
really
little
enough
chivalry
one
was
forced
to
admit
that
i
went
over
to
a
man
staring
into
a
and
asked
him
in
great
haste
what
according
to
his
opinion
should
one
give
a
man
who
had
been
starving
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
said
he
could
even
keep
beef
down
i
have
heard
say
that
milk
is
a
good
thing
hot
milk
answered
the
man
astonished
who
is
it
by
the
way
you
are
asking
for
thanks
thanks
i
say
that
idea
of
hot
milk
might
not
be
half
a
bad
notion
and
i
go
i
entered
the
first
café
i
came
to
going
along
and
asked
for
some
boiled
milk
i
got
the
milk
drank
it
down
hot
as
it
was
swallowed
it
greedily
every
drop
paid
for
it
and
went
out
again
i
took
the
road
home
now
something
singular
happened
outside
my
door
leaning
against
the
and
right
under
the
glare
of
it
stands
a
person
of
whom
i
get
a
glimpse
from
a
long
distance
it
is
the
lady
dressed
in
black
again
the
same
lady
of
the
other
evenings
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
she
had
turned
up
at
the
same
spot
for
the
fourth
time
she
is
standing
perfectly
motionless
i
find
this
so
peculiar
that
i
involuntarily
slacken
my
pace
at
this
moment
my
thoughts
are
in
good
working
order
but
i
am
much
excited
my
nerves
are
irritated
by
my
last
meal
i
pass
her
by
as
usual
am
almost
at
the
door
and
on
the
point
of
entering
there
i
stop
all
of
a
sudden
an
inspiration
seizes
me
without
rendering
myself
any
account
of
it
i
turn
round
and
go
straight
up
to
the
lady
look
her
in
the
face
and
bow
she
answers
excuse
me
was
she
looking
for
anything
i
had
noticed
her
before
could
i
be
of
assistance
to
her
in
any
way
begged
pardon
so
earnestly
for
inquiring
yes
she
did
quite
know
no
one
lived
inside
that
door
besides
three
or
four
horses
and
myself
it
was
for
that
matter
only
a
stable
and
a
tinker
workshop
she
was
certainly
on
a
wrong
track
if
she
was
seeking
any
one
there
at
this
she
turns
her
head
away
and
says
i
am
not
seeking
for
anybody
i
am
only
standing
here
it
was
really
only
a
whim
i
she
stops
indeed
really
she
only
stood
there
just
stood
there
evening
after
evening
just
for
a
whim
sake
that
was
a
little
odd
i
stood
and
pondered
over
it
and
it
perplexed
me
more
and
more
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
daring
i
jingled
my
money
in
my
pocket
and
asked
her
without
further
ado
to
come
and
have
a
glass
of
wine
some
place
or
another
in
consideration
that
winter
had
come
ha
ha
it
need
take
very
long
but
perhaps
she
would
scarcely
ah
no
thanks
she
could
well
do
that
no
she
could
do
that
but
would
i
be
so
kind
as
to
accompany
her
a
little
way
she
it
was
rather
dark
to
go
home
now
and
she
was
rather
nervous
about
going
up
carl
johann
after
it
got
so
late
we
moved
on
she
walked
at
my
right
side
a
strange
beautiful
feeling
empowered
me
the
certainty
of
being
near
a
young
girl
i
looked
at
her
the
whole
way
along
the
scent
of
her
hair
the
warmth
that
irradiated
from
her
body
the
perfume
of
woman
that
accompanied
her
the
sweet
breath
every
time
she
turned
her
face
towards
me
everything
penetrated
in
an
ungovernable
way
through
all
my
senses
so
far
i
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
full
rather
pale
face
behind
the
veil
and
a
high
bosom
that
curved
out
against
her
cape
the
thought
of
all
the
hidden
beauty
which
i
surmised
lay
sheltered
under
the
cloak
and
veil
bewildered
me
making
me
idiotically
happy
without
any
reasonable
grounds
i
could
not
endure
it
any
longer
i
touched
her
with
my
hand
passed
my
fingers
over
her
shoulder
and
smiled
imbecilely
how
queer
you
are
said
i
am
i
really
in
what
way
well
in
the
first
place
simply
she
had
a
habit
of
standing
outside
a
stable
door
evening
after
evening
without
any
object
whatever
just
for
a
whim
sake
oh
well
she
might
have
her
reason
for
doing
so
besides
she
liked
staying
up
late
at
night
it
was
a
thing
she
had
always
had
a
great
fancy
for
did
i
care
about
going
to
bed
before
twelve
i
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
i
hated
it
was
to
go
to
bed
before
twelve
at
night
ah
there
you
see
she
too
was
just
the
same
she
took
this
little
tour
in
the
evenings
when
she
had
nothing
to
lose
by
doing
so
she
lived
up
in
olav
place
ylajali
i
cried
i
beg
pardon
i
only
said
it
all
right
continue
she
lived
up
in
olav
place
lonely
enough
together
with
her
mother
to
whom
one
could
talk
because
she
was
so
deaf
was
there
anything
odd
in
her
liking
to
get
out
for
a
little
no
not
at
all
i
replied
no
well
what
then
i
could
hear
by
her
voice
that
she
was
smiling
had
she
a
sister
yes
an
older
sister
but
how
did
i
know
that
she
had
gone
to
hamburg
lately
yes
five
weeks
ago
from
where
did
i
learn
that
she
had
a
sister
i
did
learn
it
at
all
i
only
asked
we
kept
silence
a
man
passes
us
with
a
pair
of
shoes
under
his
arm
otherwise
the
street
is
empty
as
far
as
we
can
see
over
at
the
tivoli
a
long
row
of
coloured
lamps
are
burning
it
no
longer
snows
the
sky
is
clear
gracious
do
you
freeze
without
an
overcoat
inquires
the
lady
suddenly
looking
at
me
should
i
tell
her
why
i
had
no
overcoat
make
my
sorry
condition
known
at
once
and
frighten
her
away
as
well
first
as
last
still
it
was
delightful
to
walk
here
at
her
side
and
keep
her
in
ignorance
yet
a
while
longer
so
i
lied
i
answered
no
not
at
all
and
in
order
to
change
the
subject
i
asked
have
you
seen
the
menagerie
in
the
tivoli
no
she
answered
is
there
really
anything
to
see
suppose
she
were
to
take
it
into
her
head
to
wish
to
go
there
into
that
blaze
of
light
with
the
crowd
of
people
why
she
would
be
filled
with
shame
i
would
drive
her
out
again
with
my
shabby
clothes
and
lean
face
perhaps
she
might
even
notice
that
i
had
no
waistcoat
on
ah
no
there
is
sure
to
be
nothing
worth
seeing
and
a
lot
of
happy
ideas
occurred
to
me
of
which
i
at
once
made
use
a
few
sparse
words
fragments
left
in
my
dessicated
brain
what
would
one
expect
from
such
a
small
menagerie
on
the
whole
it
did
not
interest
me
in
the
least
to
see
animals
in
cases
these
animals
know
that
one
is
standing
staring
at
them
they
feel
hundreds
of
inquisitive
looks
upon
them
are
conscious
of
them
no
i
would
prefer
to
see
animals
that
did
know
one
observed
them
shy
creatures
that
nestle
in
their
lair
and
lie
with
sluggish
green
eyes
and
lick
their
claws
and
muse
eh
yes
i
was
certainly
right
in
that
it
was
only
animals
in
all
their
peculiar
fearfulness
and
peculiar
savagery
that
possessed
a
charm
the
soundless
stealthy
tread
in
the
total
darkness
of
night
the
hidden
monsters
of
the
woods
the
shrieks
of
a
bird
flying
past
the
wind
the
smell
of
blood
the
rumbling
in
space
in
short
the
reigning
spirit
of
the
kingdom
of
savage
creatures
hovering
over
savagery
the
unconscious
poetry
but
i
was
afraid
this
bored
her
the
consciousness
of
my
great
poverty
seized
me
anew
and
crushed
me
if
i
had
only
been
in
any
way
dressed
to
have
given
her
the
pleasure
of
this
little
tour
in
the
tivoli
i
could
not
make
out
this
creature
who
could
find
pleasure
in
letting
herself
be
accompanied
up
the
whole
of
carl
johann
street
by
a
beggar
what
in
the
name
of
god
was
she
thinking
of
and
why
was
i
walking
there
giving
myself
airs
and
smiling
idiotically
at
nothing
had
i
any
reasonable
cause
either
for
letting
myself
be
worried
into
a
long
walk
by
this
dainty
bird
mayhap
it
did
not
cost
me
an
effort
did
i
not
feel
the
ice
of
death
go
right
into
my
heart
at
even
the
gentlest
puff
of
wind
that
blew
against
us
was
not
madness
running
riot
in
my
brain
just
for
lack
of
food
for
many
months
at
a
stretch
yet
she
hindered
me
from
going
home
to
get
even
a
little
milk
into
my
parched
mouth
a
spoonful
of
sweet
milk
that
i
might
perhaps
be
able
to
keep
down
why
did
she
turn
her
back
on
me
and
let
me
go
to
the
deuce
i
became
distracted
my
despair
reduced
me
to
the
last
extremity
i
said
considering
all
things
you
ought
not
to
walk
with
me
i
disgrace
you
right
under
every
one
eyes
if
only
with
my
clothes
yes
it
is
positively
true
i
mean
it
she
starts
looks
up
quickly
at
me
and
is
silent
then
she
exclaims
suddenly
indeed
though
more
she
does
say
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
queried
ugh
no
you
make
me
feel
ashamed
we
have
not
got
very
far
now
and
she
walked
on
a
little
faster
we
turned
up
university
street
and
could
already
see
the
lights
in
olav
place
then
she
commenced
to
walk
slowly
again
i
have
no
wish
to
be
indiscreet
i
say
but
wo
you
tell
me
your
name
before
we
part
and
wo
you
just
for
one
second
lift
up
your
veil
so
that
i
can
see
you
i
would
be
really
so
grateful
a
pause
i
walked
on
in
expectation
you
have
seen
me
before
she
replies
ylajali
i
say
again
beg
pardon
you
followed
me
once
for
almost
right
home
were
you
tipsy
that
time
i
could
hear
again
that
she
smiled
yes
i
said
yes
worse
luck
i
was
tipsy
that
time
that
was
horrid
of
you
and
i
admitted
contritely
that
it
was
horrid
of
me
we
reached
the
fountains
we
stop
and
look
up
at
the
many
lighted
windows
of
no
now
you
must
come
any
farther
with
me
she
says
thank
you
for
coming
so
far
i
bowed
i
dare
say
anything
i
took
off
my
hat
and
stood
bareheaded
i
wonder
if
she
will
give
me
her
hand
why
do
you
ask
me
to
go
back
a
little
way
with
you
she
asks
in
a
low
voice
looking
down
at
the
toe
of
her
shoe
great
heavens
i
reply
beside
myself
great
heavens
if
you
only
would
yes
but
only
a
little
way
and
we
turned
round
i
was
fearfully
confused
i
absolutely
did
not
know
if
i
were
on
my
head
or
my
heels
this
creature
upset
all
my
chain
of
reasoning
turned
it
i
was
bewitched
and
extraordinarily
happy
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
being
dragged
enchantingly
to
destruction
she
had
expressly
willed
to
go
back
it
was
my
notion
it
was
her
own
desire
i
walk
on
and
look
at
her
and
get
more
and
more
bold
she
encourages
me
draws
me
to
her
by
each
word
she
speaks
i
forget
for
a
moment
my
poverty
my
humble
position
my
whole
miserable
condition
i
feel
my
blood
course
madly
through
my
whole
body
as
in
the
days
before
i
caved
in
and
resolved
to
feel
my
way
by
a
little
ruse
it
was
you
i
followed
that
time
said
i
it
was
your
sister
was
it
my
sister
she
questions
in
the
highest
degree
amazed
she
stands
still
looks
up
at
me
and
positively
waits
for
an
answer
she
puts
the
question
in
all
sober
earnest
yes
i
replied
hum
m
that
is
to
say
it
was
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
who
went
on
in
front
of
me
the
youngest
eh
eh
she
laughed
out
all
at
once
loudly
heartily
like
a
child
oh
how
sly
you
are
you
only
said
that
just
to
get
me
to
raise
my
veil
did
you
ah
i
thought
so
but
you
may
just
wait
till
you
are
blue
first
just
for
punishment
we
began
to
laugh
and
jest
we
talked
incessantly
all
the
time
i
do
not
know
what
i
said
i
was
so
happy
she
told
me
that
she
had
seen
me
once
before
a
long
time
ago
in
the
theatre
i
had
then
comrades
with
me
and
i
behaved
like
a
madman
i
must
certainly
have
been
tipsy
that
time
too
more
the
shame
why
did
she
think
that
oh
i
had
laughed
so
really
yes
i
used
to
laugh
a
lot
in
those
days
but
now
not
any
more
oh
yes
now
too
it
is
a
splendid
thing
to
exist
sometimes
we
reached
carl
johann
she
said
now
we
wo
go
any
farther
and
we
returned
through
university
street
when
we
arrived
at
the
fountain
once
more
i
slackened
my
pace
a
little
i
knew
that
i
could
not
go
any
farther
with
her
well
now
you
must
turn
back
here
she
said
and
stopped
yes
i
suppose
i
must
but
a
second
after
she
thought
i
might
as
well
go
as
far
as
the
door
with
her
gracious
me
there
could
be
anything
wrong
in
that
could
there
no
i
replied
but
when
we
were
standing
at
the
door
all
my
misery
confronted
me
clearly
how
was
one
to
keep
up
one
courage
when
one
was
so
broken
down
here
i
stood
before
a
young
lady
dirty
ragged
torn
disfigured
by
hunger
unwashed
and
only
it
was
enough
to
make
one
sink
into
the
earth
i
shrank
into
myself
bent
my
head
involuntarily
and
said
may
i
not
meet
you
any
more
then
i
had
no
hope
of
being
permitted
to
see
her
again
i
almost
wished
for
a
sharp
no
that
would
pull
me
together
a
bit
and
render
me
callous
yes
she
whispered
softly
almost
inaudibly
when
i
do
know
a
pause
wo
you
be
so
kind
as
to
lift
your
veil
only
just
for
a
minute
i
asked
so
that
i
can
see
whom
i
have
been
talking
to
just
for
one
moment
for
indeed
i
must
see
whom
i
have
been
talking
to
another
pause
you
can
meet
me
outside
here
on
tuesday
evening
she
said
will
you
yes
dear
lady
if
i
have
permission
to
at
eight
very
well
i
stroked
down
her
cloak
with
my
hand
merely
to
have
an
excuse
for
touching
her
it
was
a
delight
to
me
to
be
so
near
her
and
you
must
think
all
too
badly
of
me
she
added
she
was
smiling
again
no
suddenly
she
made
a
resolute
movement
and
drew
her
veil
up
over
her
forehead
we
stood
and
gazed
at
one
another
for
a
second
ylajali
i
cried
she
stretched
herself
up
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
right
on
the
mouth
only
once
swiftly
bewilderingly
swiftly
right
on
the
mouth
i
could
feel
how
her
bosom
heaved
she
was
breathing
violently
she
wrenched
herself
suddenly
out
of
my
clasp
called
a
breathlessly
whispering
and
turned
and
ran
up
the
stairs
without
a
word
more
the
hall
door
shut
it
snowed
still
more
the
next
day
a
heavy
snow
mingled
with
rain
great
wet
flakes
that
fell
to
earth
and
were
turned
to
mud
the
air
was
raw
and
icy
i
woke
somewhat
late
with
my
head
in
a
strange
state
of
confusion
my
heart
intoxicated
from
the
foregone
evening
by
the
agitation
of
that
delightful
meeting
in
my
rapture
i
had
lain
a
while
awake
and
fancied
ylajali
at
my
side
i
spread
out
my
arms
and
embraced
myself
and
kissed
the
air
at
length
i
dragged
myself
out
of
bed
and
procured
a
fresh
cup
of
milk
and
straight
on
top
of
that
a
plate
of
beef
i
was
no
longer
hungry
but
my
nerves
were
in
a
condition
i
went
off
to
the
in
the
bazaar
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
pick
up
a
waistcoat
cheaply
something
to
put
on
under
my
coat
it
did
matter
what
i
went
up
the
steps
to
the
bazaar
and
took
hold
of
one
and
began
to
examine
it
while
i
was
thus
engaged
an
acquaintance
came
by
he
nodded
and
called
up
to
me
i
let
the
waistcoat
hang
and
went
down
to
him
he
was
a
designer
and
was
on
the
way
to
his
office
come
with
me
and
have
a
glass
of
beer
he
said
but
hurry
up
i
have
much
time
what
lady
was
that
you
were
walking
with
yesterday
evening
listen
here
now
said
i
jealous
of
his
bare
thought
supposing
it
was
my
by
jove
he
exclaimed
yes
it
was
all
settled
yesterday
evening
this
nonplussed
him
completely
he
believed
me
implicitly
i
lied
in
the
most
accomplished
manner
to
get
rid
of
him
we
ordered
the
beer
drank
it
and
left
well
o
listen
he
said
suddenly
i
owe
you
a
few
shillings
it
is
a
shame
too
that
i
have
paid
you
long
ago
but
now
you
shall
have
them
during
the
next
few
days
yes
thanks
i
replied
but
i
knew
that
he
would
never
pay
me
back
the
few
shillings
the
beer
i
am
sorry
to
say
went
almost
immediately
to
my
head
the
thought
of
the
previous
evening
adventure
overwhelmed
me
made
me
delirious
supposing
she
were
not
to
meet
me
on
tuesday
supposing
she
were
to
begin
to
think
things
over
to
get
suspicious
get
suspicious
of
what
my
thoughts
gave
a
jerk
and
dwelt
upon
the
money
i
grew
afraid
deadly
afraid
of
myself
the
theft
rushed
in
upon
me
in
all
its
details
i
saw
the
little
shop
the
counter
my
lean
hands
as
i
seized
the
money
and
i
pictured
to
myself
the
line
of
action
the
police
would
adopt
when
they
would
come
to
arrest
me
irons
on
my
hands
and
feet
no
only
on
my
hands
perhaps
only
on
one
hand
the
dock
the
clerk
taking
down
the
evidence
the
scratch
of
his
pen
perhaps
he
might
take
a
new
one
for
the
occasion
his
look
his
threatening
look
there
herr
tangen
to
the
cell
the
eternally
dark
humph
i
clenched
my
hands
tightly
to
try
and
summon
courage
walked
faster
and
faster
and
came
to
the
there
i
sat
down
now
no
child
play
how
in
the
wide
world
could
any
one
prove
that
i
had
stolen
besides
the
huckster
boy
dare
not
give
an
alarm
even
if
it
should
occur
to
him
some
day
how
it
had
all
happened
he
valued
his
situation
far
too
dearly
for
that
no
noise
no
scenes
may
i
beg
but
all
the
same
this
money
weighed
in
my
pocket
sinfully
and
gave
me
no
peace
i
began
to
question
myself
and
i
became
clearly
convinced
that
i
had
been
happier
before
during
the
period
in
which
i
had
suffered
in
all
honour
and
ylajali
had
i
too
not
polluted
her
with
the
touch
of
my
sinful
hands
lord
o
lord
my
god
ylajali
i
felt
as
drunk
as
a
bat
jumped
up
suddenly
and
went
straight
over
to
the
cake
woman
who
was
sitting
near
the
chemist
under
the
sign
of
the
elephant
i
might
even
yet
lift
myself
above
dishonour
it
was
far
from
being
too
late
i
would
show
the
whole
world
that
i
was
capable
of
doing
so
on
the
way
over
i
got
the
money
in
readiness
held
every
farthing
of
it
in
my
hand
bent
down
over
the
old
woman
table
as
if
i
wanted
something
clapped
the
money
without
further
ado
into
her
hands
i
spoke
not
a
word
turned
on
my
heel
and
went
my
way
what
a
wonderful
savour
there
was
in
feeling
oneself
an
honest
man
once
more
my
empty
pockets
troubled
me
no
longer
it
was
simply
a
delightful
feeling
to
me
to
be
cleaned
out
when
i
weighed
the
whole
matter
thoroughly
this
money
had
in
reality
cost
me
much
secret
anguish
i
had
really
thought
about
it
with
dread
and
shuddering
time
upon
time
i
was
no
hardened
soul
my
honourable
nature
rebelled
against
such
a
low
action
god
be
praised
i
had
raised
myself
in
my
own
estimation
again
do
as
i
have
done
i
said
to
myself
looking
across
the
thronged
only
just
do
as
i
have
done
i
had
gladdened
a
poor
old
cake
vendor
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
was
perfectly
dumbfounded
tonight
her
children
would
go
hungry
to
bed
i
buoyed
myself
up
with
these
reflections
and
considered
that
i
had
behaved
in
a
most
exemplary
manner
god
be
praised
the
money
was
out
of
my
hands
now
tipsy
and
nervous
i
wandered
down
the
street
and
swelled
with
satisfaction
the
joy
of
being
able
to
meet
ylajali
cleanly
and
honourably
and
of
feeling
i
could
look
her
in
the
face
ran
away
with
me
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
pain
my
head
was
clear
and
buoyant
it
was
as
if
it
were
a
head
of
mere
light
that
rested
and
gleamed
on
my
shoulders
i
felt
inclined
to
play
the
wildest
pranks
to
do
something
astounding
to
set
the
whole
town
in
a
ferment
all
up
through
graendsen
i
conducted
myself
like
a
madman
there
was
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
intoxication
ran
riot
in
my
brains
the
whim
seized
me
to
go
and
tell
my
age
to
a
commissionaire
who
had
not
addressed
a
word
to
me
to
take
hold
of
his
hands
and
gaze
impressively
in
his
face
and
leave
him
again
without
any
explanation
i
distinguished
every
nuance
in
the
voice
and
laughter
of
the
observed
some
little
birds
that
hopped
before
me
in
the
street
took
to
studying
the
expression
of
the
and
discovered
all
sorts
of
tokens
and
signs
in
them
thus
occupied
i
arrive
at
length
at
parliament
place
i
stand
all
at
once
and
look
at
the
droskes
the
drivers
are
wandering
about
chatting
and
laughing
the
horses
hang
their
heads
and
cower
in
the
bitter
weather
go
ahead
i
say
giving
myself
a
dig
with
my
elbow
i
went
hurriedly
over
to
the
first
vehicle
and
got
in
ullevoldsveien
no
i
called
out
and
we
rolled
off
on
the
way
the
driver
looked
round
stooped
and
peeped
several
times
into
the
trap
where
i
sat
sheltered
underneath
the
hood
had
he
too
grown
suspicious
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
my
miserable
attire
had
attracted
his
attention
i
want
to
meet
a
man
i
called
to
him
in
order
to
be
beforehand
with
him
and
i
explained
gravely
that
i
must
really
meet
this
man
we
stop
outside
and
i
jump
out
spring
up
the
stairs
right
to
the
third
storey
seize
a
bell
and
pull
it
it
gives
six
or
seven
fearful
peals
inside
a
maid
comes
out
and
opens
the
door
i
notice
that
she
has
round
gold
drops
in
her
ears
and
black
stuff
buttons
on
her
grey
bodice
she
looks
at
me
with
a
frightened
air
i
inquire
for
kierulf
joachim
kierulf
if
i
might
add
further
a
in
short
not
a
man
one
could
make
a
mistake
about
the
girl
shook
her
head
no
kierulf
lives
here
said
she
she
stared
at
me
and
held
the
door
ready
to
close
it
she
made
no
effort
to
find
the
man
for
me
she
really
looked
as
if
she
knew
the
person
i
inquired
for
if
she
would
only
take
the
trouble
to
reflect
a
bit
the
lazy
jade
i
got
vexed
turned
my
back
on
her
and
ran
downstairs
again
he
was
there
i
called
to
the
driver
was
he
there
no
drive
to
tomtegaden
no
i
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
violent
excitement
and
imparted
something
of
the
same
feeling
to
the
driver
he
evidently
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
he
drove
on
without
further
ado
he
whipped
up
the
horse
sharply
what
the
man
name
he
inquired
turning
round
on
the
box
kierulf
a
dealer
in
wool
kierulf
and
the
driver
too
thought
this
was
a
man
one
would
not
be
likely
to
make
any
mistake
about
did
he
generally
wear
a
light
morning
coat
what
i
cried
a
light
are
you
mad
do
you
think
it
is
a
i
am
inquiring
about
this
light
came
most
inopportunely
it
spoilt
the
whole
man
for
me
such
as
i
had
fancied
him
what
was
it
you
said
he
was
called
kierulf
of
course
i
replied
is
there
anything
wonderful
in
that
the
name
does
disgrace
any
one
has
he
red
hair
well
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
had
red
hair
and
now
that
the
driver
mentioned
the
matter
i
was
suddenly
convinced
that
he
was
right
i
felt
grateful
to
the
poor
driver
and
hastened
to
inform
him
that
he
had
hit
the
man
off
to
a
t
he
really
was
just
as
he
described
him
and
i
remarked
in
addition
that
it
would
be
a
phenomenon
to
see
such
a
man
without
red
hair
it
must
be
him
i
drove
a
couple
of
times
said
the
driver
he
had
a
knobbed
stick
this
brought
the
man
vividly
before
me
and
i
said
ha
ha
i
suppose
no
one
has
ever
yet
seen
the
man
without
a
knobbed
stick
in
his
hand
of
that
you
can
be
certain
quite
certain
yes
it
was
clear
that
it
was
the
same
man
he
had
driven
he
recognized
him
and
he
drove
so
that
the
horse
shoes
struck
sparks
as
they
touched
the
stones
all
through
this
phase
of
excitement
i
had
not
for
one
second
lost
my
presence
of
mind
we
pass
a
policeman
and
i
notice
his
number
is
this
number
struck
me
with
such
vivid
clearness
that
it
penetrated
like
a
splint
into
my
brain
accurately
i
would
forget
it
i
leant
back
in
the
vehicle
a
prey
to
the
wildest
fancies
crouched
under
the
hood
so
that
no
one
could
see
me
i
moved
my
lips
and
commenced
to
i
talk
idiotically
to
myself
madness
rages
through
my
brain
and
i
let
it
rage
i
am
fully
conscious
that
i
am
succumbing
to
influences
over
which
i
have
no
control
i
begin
to
laugh
silently
passionately
without
a
trace
of
cause
still
merry
and
intoxicated
from
the
couple
of
glasses
of
ale
i
have
drunk
little
by
little
my
excitement
abates
my
calm
returns
more
and
more
to
me
i
feel
the
cold
in
my
sore
finger
and
i
stick
it
down
inside
my
collar
to
warm
it
a
little
at
length
we
reach
tomtegaden
the
driver
pulls
up
i
alight
without
any
haste
absently
listlessly
with
my
head
heavy
i
go
through
a
gateway
and
come
into
a
yard
across
which
i
pass
i
come
to
a
door
which
i
open
and
pass
through
i
find
myself
in
a
lobby
a
sort
of
anteroom
with
two
windows
there
are
two
boxes
in
it
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
one
corner
and
against
the
wall
an
old
painted
over
which
a
rug
is
spread
to
the
right
in
the
next
room
i
hear
voices
and
the
cry
of
a
child
and
above
me
on
the
second
floor
the
sound
of
an
iron
plate
being
hammered
all
this
i
notice
the
moment
as
i
enter
i
step
quietly
across
the
room
to
the
opposite
door
without
any
haste
without
any
thought
of
flight
open
it
too
and
come
out
in
vognmansgaden
i
look
up
at
the
house
through
which
i
have
passed
refreshment
and
lodgings
for
travellers
it
is
not
my
intention
to
escape
to
steal
away
from
the
driver
who
is
waiting
for
me
i
go
very
coolly
down
vognmansgaden
without
fear
of
being
conscious
of
doing
any
wrong
kierulf
this
dealer
in
wool
who
has
spooked
in
my
brain
so
long
this
creature
in
whose
existence
i
believe
and
whom
it
was
of
vital
importance
that
i
should
meet
had
vanished
from
my
memory
was
wiped
out
with
many
other
mad
whims
which
came
and
went
in
turns
i
recalled
him
no
longer
except
as
a
reminiscence
a
phantom
in
measure
as
i
walked
on
i
become
more
and
more
sober
felt
languid
and
weary
and
dragged
my
legs
after
me
the
snow
still
fell
in
great
moist
flakes
at
last
i
reached
gronland
far
out
near
the
church
i
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
seat
all
the
looked
at
me
with
much
astonishment
i
fell
thou
good
god
what
a
miserable
plight
i
have
come
to
i
was
so
heartily
tired
and
weary
of
all
my
miserable
life
that
i
did
not
find
it
worth
the
trouble
of
fighting
any
longer
to
preserve
it
adversity
had
gained
the
upper
hand
it
had
been
too
strong
for
me
i
had
become
so
strangely
and
broken
a
mere
shadow
of
what
i
once
had
been
my
shoulders
were
sunken
right
down
on
one
side
and
i
had
contracted
a
habit
of
stooping
forward
fearfully
as
i
walked
in
order
to
spare
my
chest
what
little
i
could
i
had
examined
my
body
a
few
days
ago
one
noon
up
in
my
room
and
i
had
stood
and
cried
over
it
the
whole
time
i
had
worn
the
same
shirt
for
many
weeks
and
it
was
quite
stiff
with
stale
sweat
and
had
chafed
my
skin
a
little
blood
and
water
ran
out
of
the
sore
place
it
did
not
hurt
much
but
it
was
very
tiresome
to
have
this
tender
place
in
the
middle
of
my
stomach
i
had
no
remedy
for
it
and
it
would
heal
of
its
own
accord
i
washed
it
dried
it
carefully
and
put
on
the
same
shirt
there
was
no
help
for
it
it
i
sit
there
on
the
bench
and
ponder
over
all
this
and
am
sad
enough
i
loathe
myself
my
very
hands
seem
distasteful
to
me
the
loose
almost
coarse
expression
of
the
backs
of
them
pains
me
disgusts
me
i
feel
myself
rudely
affected
by
the
sight
of
my
lean
fingers
i
hate
the
whole
of
my
gaunt
shrunken
body
and
shrink
from
bearing
it
from
feeling
it
envelop
me
lord
if
the
whole
thing
would
come
to
an
end
now
i
would
heartily
gladly
die
completely
worsted
soiled
defiled
and
debased
in
my
own
estimation
i
rose
mechanically
and
commenced
to
turn
my
steps
homewards
on
the
way
i
passed
a
door
upon
which
the
following
was
to
be
read
on
a
plate
to
be
had
at
miss
andersen
door
to
the
right
old
memories
i
muttered
as
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
my
former
room
in
hammersborg
the
little
the
newspapers
near
the
door
the
lighthouse
director
announcement
and
fabian
olsen
the
baker
bread
ah
yes
times
were
better
with
me
then
than
now
one
night
i
had
written
a
tale
for
ten
shillings
now
i
write
anything
my
head
grew
light
as
soon
as
ever
i
attempted
it
yes
i
would
put
an
end
to
it
now
and
i
went
on
and
on
as
i
got
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
provision
shop
i
had
the
feeling
of
approaching
a
danger
but
i
determined
to
stick
to
my
purpose
i
would
give
myself
up
i
ran
quickly
up
the
steps
at
the
door
i
met
a
little
girl
who
was
carrying
a
cup
in
her
hands
and
i
slipped
past
her
and
opened
the
door
the
shop
boy
and
i
stand
face
to
face
alone
for
the
second
time
well
he
exclaims
fearfully
bad
weather
now
is
it
what
did
this
going
round
the
bush
signify
why
did
he
seize
me
at
once
i
got
furious
and
cried
oh
i
have
come
to
prate
about
the
weather
this
violent
preliminary
takes
him
aback
his
little
huckster
brain
fails
him
it
has
never
even
occurred
to
him
that
i
have
cheated
him
of
five
shillings
do
you
know
then
that
i
have
swindled
you
i
query
impatiently
and
i
breathe
quickly
with
the
excitement
i
tremble
and
am
ready
to
use
force
if
he
does
come
to
the
point
but
the
poor
man
has
no
misgivings
well
bless
my
soul
what
stupid
creatures
one
has
to
mix
with
in
this
world
i
abuse
him
explain
to
him
every
detail
as
to
how
it
had
all
happened
show
him
where
the
fact
was
accomplished
where
the
money
had
lain
how
i
had
gathered
it
up
in
my
hand
and
closed
my
fingers
over
it
and
he
takes
it
all
in
and
does
nothing
he
shifts
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
listens
for
footsteps
in
the
next
room
make
signs
to
hush
me
to
try
and
make
me
speak
lower
and
says
at
last
it
was
a
mean
enough
thing
of
you
to
do
no
hold
on
i
explained
in
my
desire
to
contradict
him
to
aggravate
him
it
was
quite
so
mean
as
he
imagined
it
to
be
in
his
huckster
head
naturally
i
did
keep
the
money
that
could
never
have
entered
my
head
i
for
my
part
scorned
to
derive
any
benefit
from
it
that
was
opposed
to
my
thoroughly
honest
nature
what
did
you
do
with
it
then
i
gave
it
away
to
a
poor
old
woman
every
farthing
of
it
he
must
understand
that
that
was
the
sort
of
person
i
was
i
did
forget
the
poor
so
he
stands
and
thinks
over
this
a
while
becomes
manifestly
very
dubious
as
to
how
far
i
am
an
honest
man
or
not
at
last
he
says
ought
you
rather
to
have
brought
it
back
again
now
listen
here
i
reply
i
did
want
to
get
you
into
trouble
in
any
way
but
that
is
the
thanks
one
gets
for
being
generous
here
i
stand
and
explain
the
whole
thing
to
you
and
you
simply
instead
of
being
ashamed
as
a
dog
make
no
effort
to
settle
the
dispute
with
me
therefore
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
and
as
for
the
rest
i
say
devil
take
you
i
left
slamming
the
door
behind
me
but
when
i
got
home
to
my
room
into
the
melancholy
hole
wet
through
from
the
soft
snow
trembling
in
my
knees
from
the
day
wanderings
i
dismounted
instantly
from
my
high
horse
and
sank
together
once
more
i
regretted
my
attack
upon
the
poor
wept
clutched
myself
by
the
throat
to
punish
myself
for
my
miserable
trick
and
behaved
like
a
lunatic
he
had
naturally
been
in
the
most
deadly
terror
for
the
sake
of
his
situation
he
had
not
dared
to
make
any
fuss
about
the
five
shillings
that
were
lost
to
the
business
and
i
had
taken
advantage
of
his
fear
had
tortured
him
with
my
violent
address
stabbed
him
with
every
loud
word
that
i
had
roared
out
and
the
master
himself
had
perhaps
been
sitting
inside
the
inner
room
almost
within
an
ace
of
feeling
called
upon
to
come
out
and
inquire
what
was
the
row
no
there
was
no
longer
any
limit
to
the
low
things
i
might
be
tempted
to
do
well
why
had
i
been
locked
up
then
it
would
have
come
to
an
end
i
would
almost
have
stretched
out
my
wrists
for
the
handcuffs
i
would
not
have
offered
the
slightest
resistance
on
the
contrary
i
would
have
assisted
them
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
one
day
of
my
life
for
one
happy
second
again
my
whole
life
for
a
mess
of
lentils
hear
me
only
this
once
i
lay
down
in
the
wet
clothes
i
had
on
with
a
vague
idea
that
i
might
die
during
the
night
and
i
used
my
last
strength
to
tidy
up
my
bed
a
little
so
that
it
might
appear
a
little
orderly
about
me
in
the
morning
i
folded
my
hands
and
chose
my
position
all
at
once
i
remember
ylajali
to
think
that
i
could
have
forgotten
her
the
entire
evening
through
and
light
forces
its
way
ever
so
faintly
into
my
spirit
again
a
little
ray
of
sunshine
that
makes
me
so
blessedly
warm
and
gradually
more
sun
comes
a
rare
silken
balmy
light
that
caresses
me
with
soothing
loveliness
and
the
sun
grows
stronger
and
stronger
burns
sharply
in
my
temples
seethes
fiercely
and
glowingly
in
my
emaciated
brain
and
at
last
a
maddening
pyre
of
rays
flames
up
before
my
eyes
a
heaven
and
earth
in
conflagration
men
and
beasts
of
fire
mountains
of
fire
devils
of
fire
an
abyss
a
wilderness
a
hurricane
a
universe
in
brazen
ignition
a
smoking
smouldering
day
of
doom
and
i
saw
and
heard
no
more
i
woke
in
a
sweat
the
next
morning
moist
all
over
my
whole
body
bathed
in
dampness
the
fever
had
laid
violent
hands
on
me
at
first
i
had
no
clear
idea
of
what
had
happened
to
me
i
looked
about
me
in
amazement
felt
a
complete
transformation
of
my
being
absolutely
failed
to
recognize
myself
again
i
felt
along
my
own
arms
and
down
my
legs
was
struck
with
astonishment
that
the
window
was
where
it
was
and
not
in
the
opposite
wall
and
i
could
hear
the
tramp
of
the
feet
in
the
yard
below
as
if
it
came
from
above
me
i
felt
rather
sick
too
qualmish
my
hair
clung
wet
and
cold
about
my
forehead
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
and
looked
at
the
pillow
damp
hair
lay
on
it
too
in
patches
my
feet
had
swelled
up
in
my
shoes
during
the
night
but
they
caused
me
no
pain
only
i
could
not
move
my
toes
much
they
were
too
stiff
as
the
afternoon
closed
in
and
it
had
already
begun
to
grow
a
little
dusk
i
got
up
out
of
bed
and
commenced
to
move
about
the
room
a
little
i
felt
my
way
with
short
careful
steps
taking
care
to
keep
my
balance
and
spare
my
feet
as
much
as
possible
i
did
not
suffer
much
and
i
did
not
cry
neither
was
i
taking
all
into
consideration
sad
on
the
contrary
i
was
blissfully
content
it
did
not
strike
me
just
then
that
anything
could
be
otherwise
than
it
was
then
i
went
out
the
only
thing
that
troubled
me
a
little
in
spite
of
the
nausea
that
the
thought
of
food
inspired
in
me
was
hunger
i
commenced
to
be
sensible
of
a
shameless
appetite
again
a
ravenous
lust
of
food
which
grew
steadily
worse
and
worse
it
gnawed
unmercifully
in
my
breast
carrying
on
a
silent
mysterious
work
in
there
it
was
as
if
a
score
of
diminutive
insects
set
their
heads
on
one
side
and
gnawed
for
a
little
then
laid
their
heads
on
the
other
side
and
gnawed
a
little
more
then
lay
quite
still
for
a
moment
space
and
then
began
afresh
boring
noiselessly
in
and
without
any
haste
and
left
empty
spaces
everywhere
after
them
as
they
went
on
i
was
not
ill
but
faint
i
broke
into
a
sweat
i
thought
of
going
to
the
to
rest
a
while
but
the
way
was
long
and
wearisome
at
last
i
had
almost
reached
it
i
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
market
and
market
street
the
sweat
ran
down
into
my
eyes
and
blinded
me
and
i
had
just
stopped
in
order
to
wipe
it
away
a
little
i
did
not
notice
the
place
i
was
standing
in
in
fact
i
did
not
think
about
it
the
noise
around
me
was
something
frightful
suddenly
a
call
rings
out
a
cold
sharp
warning
i
hear
this
cry
hear
it
quite
well
and
i
start
nervously
to
one
side
stepping
as
quickly
as
my
bad
foot
allows
me
to
a
monster
of
a
brushes
past
me
and
the
wheel
grazes
my
coat
i
might
perhaps
have
been
a
little
quicker
if
i
had
exerted
myself
well
there
was
no
help
for
it
one
foot
pained
me
a
couple
of
toes
were
crunched
i
felt
that
they
as
it
were
curled
up
in
my
shoes
the
driver
reins
in
his
horse
with
all
his
might
he
turns
round
on
the
van
and
inquires
in
a
fright
how
it
fares
with
me
oh
it
might
have
been
worse
far
worse
it
was
perhaps
not
so
dangerous
i
think
any
bones
were
broken
oh
pray
i
rushed
over
as
quickly
as
i
could
to
a
seat
all
these
people
who
stopped
and
stared
at
me
abashed
me
after
all
it
was
no
mortal
blow
comparatively
speaking
i
had
got
off
luckily
enough
as
misfortune
was
bound
to
come
in
my
way
the
worst
thing
was
that
my
shoe
was
crushed
to
pieces
the
sole
was
torn
loose
at
the
toe
i
help
up
my
foot
and
saw
blood
inside
the
gap
well
it
was
intentional
on
either
side
it
was
not
the
man
purpose
to
make
things
worse
for
me
than
they
were
he
looked
much
concerned
about
it
it
was
quite
certain
that
if
i
had
begged
him
for
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
his
cart
he
would
have
given
it
to
me
he
would
certainly
have
given
it
to
me
gladly
god
bless
him
in
return
wherever
he
is
i
was
terribly
hungry
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
and
my
shameless
appetite
i
writhed
from
side
to
side
on
the
seat
and
bowed
my
chest
right
down
to
my
knees
i
was
almost
distracted
when
it
got
dark
i
jogged
along
to
the
town
hall
god
knows
how
i
got
there
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
i
tore
a
pocket
out
of
my
coat
and
took
to
chewing
it
not
with
any
defined
object
but
with
dour
mien
and
unseeing
eyes
staring
straight
into
space
i
could
hear
a
group
of
little
children
playing
around
near
me
and
perceive
in
an
instinctive
sort
of
way
some
pedestrians
pass
me
by
otherwise
i
observed
nothing
all
at
once
it
enters
my
head
to
go
to
one
of
the
meat
bazaars
underneath
me
and
beg
a
piece
of
raw
meat
i
go
straight
along
the
balustrade
to
the
other
side
of
the
bazaar
buildings
and
descend
the
steps
when
i
had
nearly
reached
the
stalls
on
the
lower
floor
i
called
up
the
archway
leading
to
the
stairs
and
made
a
threatening
backward
gesture
as
if
i
were
talking
to
a
dog
up
there
and
boldly
addressed
the
first
butcher
i
met
ah
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
bone
for
my
dog
i
said
only
a
bone
there
need
be
anything
on
it
it
just
to
give
him
something
to
carry
in
his
mouth
i
got
the
bone
a
capital
little
bone
on
which
there
still
remained
a
morsel
of
meat
and
hid
it
under
my
coat
i
thanked
the
man
so
heartily
that
he
looked
at
me
in
amazement
oh
no
need
of
thanks
said
he
oh
yes
do
say
that
i
mumbled
it
is
kindly
done
of
you
and
i
ascended
the
steps
again
my
heart
was
throbbing
violently
in
my
breast
i
sneaked
into
one
of
the
passages
where
the
forges
are
as
far
in
as
i
could
go
and
stopped
outside
a
dilapidated
door
leading
to
a
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
only
blessed
darkness
all
around
me
and
i
began
to
gnaw
at
the
bone
it
had
no
taste
a
rank
smell
of
blood
oozed
from
it
and
i
was
forced
to
vomit
almost
immediately
i
tried
anew
if
i
could
only
keep
it
down
it
would
in
spite
of
all
have
some
effect
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
forcing
it
to
remain
down
there
but
i
vomited
again
i
grew
wild
bit
angrily
into
the
meat
tore
off
a
morsel
and
gulped
it
down
by
sheer
strength
of
will
and
yet
it
was
of
no
use
just
as
soon
as
the
little
fragments
of
meat
became
warm
in
my
stomach
up
they
came
again
worse
luck
i
clenched
my
hands
in
frenzy
burst
into
tears
from
sheer
helplessness
and
gnawed
away
as
one
possessed
i
cried
so
that
the
bone
got
wet
and
dirty
with
my
tears
vomited
cursed
and
groaned
again
cried
as
if
my
heart
would
break
and
vomited
anew
i
consigned
all
the
powers
that
be
to
the
lowermost
torture
in
the
loudest
voice
quiet
not
a
soul
about
no
light
no
noise
i
am
in
a
state
of
the
most
fearful
excitement
i
breathe
hardly
and
audibly
and
i
cry
with
gnashing
teeth
each
time
that
the
morsel
of
meat
which
might
satisfy
me
a
little
comes
up
as
i
find
that
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
it
avails
me
naught
i
cast
the
bone
at
the
door
i
am
filled
with
the
most
impotent
hate
shriek
and
menace
with
my
fists
towards
heaven
yell
god
name
hoarsely
and
bend
my
fingers
like
claws
with
fury
i
tell
you
you
heaven
holy
baal
you
do
exist
but
that
if
you
did
i
would
curse
you
so
that
your
heaven
would
quiver
with
the
fire
of
hell
i
tell
you
i
have
offered
you
my
service
and
you
repulsed
me
and
i
turn
my
back
on
you
for
all
eternity
because
you
did
not
know
your
time
of
visitation
i
tell
you
that
i
am
about
to
die
and
yet
i
mock
you
you
heaven
god
and
apis
with
death
staring
me
in
the
face
i
tell
you
i
would
rather
be
a
bondsman
in
hell
than
a
freedman
in
your
mansions
i
tell
you
i
am
filled
with
a
blissful
contempt
for
your
divine
paltriness
and
i
choose
the
abyss
of
destruction
for
a
perpetual
resort
where
the
devils
judas
and
pharaoh
are
cast
down
i
tell
you
your
heaven
is
full
of
the
kingdom
of
the
earth
most
idiots
and
in
spirit
i
tell
you
you
have
filled
your
heaven
with
the
grossest
and
most
cherished
harlots
from
here
below
who
have
bent
their
knees
piteously
before
you
at
their
hour
of
death
i
tell
you
you
have
used
force
against
me
and
you
know
not
you
omniscient
nullity
that
i
never
bend
in
opposition
i
tell
you
all
my
life
every
cell
in
my
body
every
power
of
my
soul
gasps
to
mock
you
you
gracious
monster
on
high
i
tell
you
i
would
if
i
could
breathe
it
into
every
human
soul
every
flower
every
leaf
every
dewdrop
in
the
garden
i
tell
you
i
would
scoff
you
on
the
day
of
doom
and
curse
the
teeth
out
of
my
mouth
for
the
sake
of
your
deity
boundless
miserableness
i
tell
you
from
this
hour
i
renounce
all
thy
works
and
all
thy
pomps
i
will
execrate
my
thought
if
it
dwell
on
you
again
and
tear
out
my
lips
if
they
ever
utter
your
name
i
tell
you
if
you
exist
my
last
word
in
life
or
in
death
i
bid
you
farewell
for
all
time
and
eternity
i
bid
you
farewell
with
heart
and
reins
i
bid
you
the
last
irrevocable
farewell
and
i
am
silent
and
turn
my
back
on
you
and
go
my
way
quiet
i
tremble
with
excitement
and
exhaustion
and
stand
on
the
same
spot
still
whispering
oaths
and
abusive
epithets
hiccoughing
after
the
violent
crying
fit
broken
down
and
apathetic
after
my
frenzied
outburst
of
rage
i
stand
there
for
maybe
an
hour
hiccough
and
whisper
and
hold
on
to
the
door
then
i
hear
voices
a
conversation
between
two
men
who
are
coming
down
the
passage
i
slink
away
from
the
door
drag
myself
along
the
walls
of
the
houses
and
come
out
again
into
the
light
streets
as
i
jog
along
young
hill
my
brain
begins
to
work
in
a
most
peculiar
direction
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
wretched
hovels
down
at
the
corner
of
the
the
stores
for
loose
materials
the
old
booths
for
clothes
are
really
a
disgrace
to
the
place
they
spoilt
the
whole
appearance
of
the
market
and
were
a
blot
on
the
town
fie
away
with
the
rubbish
and
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
as
i
walked
on
what
it
would
cost
to
remove
the
geographical
survey
down
there
that
handsome
building
which
had
always
attracted
me
so
much
each
time
i
passed
it
it
would
perhaps
not
be
possible
to
undertake
a
removal
of
that
kind
under
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
a
pretty
sum
three
hundred
pounds
one
must
admit
a
tidy
enough
little
sum
for
ha
ha
just
to
make
a
start
with
eh
and
i
nodded
my
head
and
conceded
that
it
was
a
tidy
enough
bit
of
to
make
a
start
with
i
was
still
trembling
over
my
whole
body
and
hiccoughed
now
and
then
violently
after
my
cry
i
had
a
feeling
that
there
was
not
much
life
left
in
me
that
i
was
really
singing
my
last
verse
it
was
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
it
did
not
trouble
me
in
the
least
on
the
contrary
i
wended
my
way
down
town
down
to
the
wharf
farther
and
farther
away
from
my
room
i
would
for
that
matter
have
willingly
laid
myself
down
flat
in
the
street
to
die
my
sufferings
were
rendering
me
more
and
more
callous
my
sore
foot
throbbed
violently
i
had
a
sensation
as
if
the
pain
was
creeping
up
through
my
whole
leg
but
not
even
that
caused
me
any
particular
distress
i
had
endured
worse
sensations
in
this
manner
i
reached
the
railway
wharf
there
was
no
traffic
no
noise
only
here
and
there
a
person
to
be
seen
a
labourer
or
sailor
slinking
round
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
i
took
notice
of
a
lame
man
who
looked
sharply
at
me
as
we
passed
one
another
i
stopped
him
instinctively
touched
my
hat
and
inquired
if
he
knew
if
the
nun
had
sailed
someway
i
could
help
snapping
my
fingers
right
under
the
man
nose
and
saying
ay
by
jove
the
yes
the
which
i
had
totally
forgotten
all
the
same
the
thought
of
her
had
been
smouldering
in
me
i
had
carried
it
about
unconsciously
yes
bless
me
the
nun
had
sailed
he
could
tell
me
where
she
had
sailed
to
the
man
reflects
stands
on
his
long
leg
keeps
the
other
up
in
the
air
it
dangles
a
little
no
he
replies
do
you
know
what
cargo
she
was
taking
in
here
no
i
answer
but
by
this
time
i
had
already
lost
interest
in
the
and
i
asked
the
man
how
far
it
might
be
to
holmestrand
reckoned
in
good
old
geographical
miles
to
holmestrand
i
should
think
or
to
voeblungsnaess
what
was
i
going
to
say
i
should
think
to
holmestrand
oh
never
mind
i
have
just
remembered
it
i
interrupted
him
again
you
would
perhaps
be
so
kind
as
to
give
me
a
small
bit
of
tobacco
only
just
a
tiny
scrap
i
received
the
tobacco
thanked
the
man
heartily
and
went
on
i
made
no
use
of
the
tobacco
i
put
it
into
my
pocket
he
still
kept
his
eye
on
me
perhaps
i
had
aroused
his
suspicions
in
some
other
way
or
another
whether
i
stood
still
or
walked
on
i
felt
his
suspicious
look
following
me
i
had
no
mind
to
be
persecuted
by
this
creature
i
turn
round
and
dragging
myself
back
to
him
say
binder
only
this
one
word
binder
no
more
i
looked
fixedly
at
him
as
i
say
it
indeed
i
was
conscious
of
staring
fearfully
at
him
it
was
as
if
i
saw
him
with
my
entire
body
instead
of
only
with
my
eyes
i
stare
for
a
while
after
i
give
utterance
to
this
word
and
then
i
jog
along
again
to
the
railway
square
the
man
does
not
utter
a
syllable
he
only
keeps
his
gaze
fixed
upon
me
binder
i
stood
suddenly
still
yes
was
that
just
what
i
had
a
feeling
of
the
moment
i
met
the
old
chap
a
feeling
that
i
had
met
him
before
one
bright
morning
up
in
graendsen
when
i
pawned
my
waistcoat
it
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
since
that
day
whilst
i
stand
and
ponder
over
this
i
lean
and
support
myself
against
a
house
wall
at
the
corner
of
the
railway
square
and
harbour
street
suddenly
i
start
quickly
and
make
an
effort
to
crawl
away
as
i
do
not
succeed
in
it
i
stare
ahead
of
me
and
fling
all
shame
to
the
winds
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
am
standing
face
to
face
with
the
commandor
i
get
brazen
i
take
yet
a
step
farther
from
the
wall
in
order
to
make
him
notice
me
i
do
not
do
it
to
awake
his
compassion
but
to
mortify
myself
place
myself
as
it
were
on
the
pillory
i
could
have
flung
myself
down
in
the
street
and
begged
him
to
walk
over
me
tread
on
my
face
i
do
even
bid
him
perhaps
the
commandor
guesses
that
something
is
amiss
with
me
he
slackens
his
pace
a
little
and
i
say
in
order
to
stop
him
i
would
have
called
upon
you
long
ago
with
something
but
nothing
has
come
yet
indeed
he
replies
in
an
interrogative
tone
you
have
got
it
finished
then
no
it
did
get
finished
my
eyes
by
this
time
are
filled
with
tears
at
his
friendliness
and
i
cough
with
a
bitter
effort
to
regain
my
composure
the
commandor
tweaks
his
nose
and
looks
at
me
have
you
anything
to
live
on
in
the
meantime
he
questions
no
i
reply
i
have
that
either
i
have
eaten
anything
today
but
the
lord
preserve
you
man
it
will
never
do
for
you
to
go
and
starve
yourself
to
death
he
exclaims
feeling
in
his
pocket
this
causes
a
feeling
of
shame
to
awake
in
me
and
i
stagger
over
to
the
wall
and
hold
on
to
it
i
see
him
finger
in
his
purse
and
he
hands
me
he
makes
no
fuss
about
it
simply
gives
me
reiterating
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
never
do
to
let
me
starve
to
death
i
stammered
an
objection
and
did
not
take
it
all
at
once
it
is
shameful
of
me
to
it
was
really
too
much
hurry
up
he
says
looking
at
his
watch
i
have
been
waiting
for
the
train
i
hear
it
coming
now
i
took
the
money
i
was
dumb
with
joy
and
never
said
a
word
i
even
thank
him
once
it
is
worth
while
feeling
put
out
about
it
said
the
commandor
at
last
i
know
you
can
write
for
it
and
so
off
he
went
when
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
i
remembered
all
at
once
that
i
had
not
thanked
him
for
this
great
assistance
i
tried
to
overtake
him
but
could
not
get
on
quickly
enough
my
legs
failed
me
and
i
came
near
tumbling
on
my
face
he
went
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
i
gave
up
the
attempt
thought
of
calling
after
him
but
dared
not
and
when
after
all
i
did
muster
up
courage
enough
and
called
once
or
twice
he
was
already
at
too
great
a
distance
and
my
voice
had
become
too
weak
i
was
left
standing
on
the
pavement
gazing
after
him
i
wept
quietly
and
silently
i
never
saw
the
like
i
said
to
myself
he
gave
me
i
walked
back
and
placed
myself
where
he
had
stood
imitated
all
his
movements
held
the
up
to
my
moistened
eyes
inspected
it
on
both
sides
and
began
to
swear
to
swear
at
the
top
of
my
voice
that
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
that
what
i
held
in
my
hand
was
an
hour
after
maybe
a
very
long
hour
for
it
had
grown
very
silent
all
around
me
i
stood
singularly
enough
outside
no
tomtegaden
after
i
had
stood
and
collected
my
wits
for
a
moment
and
wondered
thereat
i
went
through
the
door
for
the
second
time
right
into
the
entertainment
and
lodgings
for
travellers
here
i
asked
for
shelter
and
was
immediately
supplied
with
a
bed
tuesday
sunshine
and
quiet
a
strangely
bright
day
the
snow
had
disappeared
there
was
life
and
joy
and
glad
faces
smiles
and
laughter
everywhere
the
fountains
threw
up
sprays
of
water
in
jets
from
the
azure
from
the
sky
at
noon
i
left
my
lodgings
in
tomtegaden
where
i
still
lived
and
found
fairly
comfortable
and
set
out
for
town
i
was
in
the
merriest
humour
and
lazied
about
the
whole
afternoon
through
the
most
frequented
streets
and
looked
at
the
people
even
before
seven
i
took
a
turn
up
olav
place
and
took
a
furtive
look
up
at
the
window
of
no
in
an
hour
i
would
see
her
i
went
about
the
whole
time
in
a
state
of
tremulous
delicious
dread
what
would
happen
what
should
i
say
when
she
came
down
the
stairs
or
only
smile
i
concluded
to
let
it
rest
with
the
smile
of
course
i
would
bow
profoundly
to
her
i
stole
away
a
little
ashamed
to
be
there
so
early
wandered
up
carl
johann
for
a
while
and
kept
my
eyes
on
university
street
when
the
clocks
struck
eight
i
walked
once
more
towards
olav
place
on
the
way
it
struck
me
that
perhaps
i
might
arrive
a
few
minutes
too
late
and
i
quickened
my
pace
as
much
as
i
could
my
foot
was
very
sore
otherwise
nothing
ailed
me
i
took
up
my
place
at
the
fountain
and
drew
breath
i
stood
there
a
long
while
and
gazed
up
at
the
window
of
no
but
she
did
not
come
well
i
would
wait
i
was
in
no
hurry
she
might
be
delayed
and
i
waited
on
it
could
well
be
that
i
had
dreamt
the
whole
thing
had
my
first
meeting
with
her
only
existed
in
imagination
the
night
i
lay
in
delirium
i
began
in
perplexity
to
think
over
it
and
was
at
all
sure
hem
came
from
behind
me
i
heard
this
and
i
also
heard
light
steps
near
me
but
i
did
not
turn
round
i
only
stared
up
at
the
wide
staircase
before
me
came
then
i
forget
to
smile
i
do
even
take
off
my
hat
at
first
i
am
so
taken
aback
to
see
her
come
this
way
have
you
been
waiting
long
she
asks
she
is
breathing
a
little
quickly
after
her
walk
no
not
at
all
i
only
came
a
little
while
ago
i
reply
and
besides
would
it
matter
if
i
had
waited
long
i
expected
that
you
would
come
from
another
direction
i
accompanied
mamma
to
some
people
mamma
is
spending
the
evening
with
them
oh
indeed
i
say
we
had
begun
to
walk
on
involuntarily
a
policeman
is
standing
at
the
corner
looking
at
us
but
after
all
where
are
we
going
to
she
asks
and
stops
wherever
you
wish
only
where
wish
ugh
yes
but
it
such
a
bore
to
have
to
decide
oneself
a
pause
then
i
say
merely
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
i
see
it
dark
up
in
your
windows
yes
it
is
she
replies
gaily
the
servant
has
an
evening
off
too
so
i
am
all
alone
at
home
we
both
stand
and
look
up
at
the
windows
of
no
as
if
neither
of
us
had
seen
them
before
ca
we
go
up
to
your
place
then
i
say
i
shall
sit
down
at
the
door
the
whole
time
if
you
like
but
then
i
trembled
with
emotion
and
regretted
greatly
that
i
had
perhaps
been
too
forward
supposing
she
were
to
get
angry
and
leave
me
suppose
i
were
never
to
see
her
again
ah
that
miserable
attire
of
mine
i
waited
despairingly
for
her
reply
you
shall
certainly
not
sit
down
by
the
door
she
says
she
says
it
right
down
tenderly
and
says
accurately
these
words
you
shall
certainly
not
sit
down
by
the
door
we
went
up
out
on
the
lobby
where
it
was
dark
she
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
led
me
on
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
being
so
quiet
she
said
i
could
very
well
talk
we
entered
whilst
she
lit
the
candle
it
was
not
a
lamp
she
lit
but
a
candle
whilst
she
lit
the
candle
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
but
now
you
must
look
at
me
ugh
i
am
so
ashamed
but
i
will
never
do
it
again
what
will
you
never
do
again
i
will
never
ugh
no
good
gracious
i
will
never
kiss
you
again
wo
you
i
said
and
we
both
laughed
i
stretched
out
my
arms
to
her
and
she
glided
away
slipped
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
we
stood
a
while
and
gazed
at
one
another
the
candle
stood
right
between
us
try
and
catch
me
she
said
and
with
much
laughter
i
tried
to
seize
hold
of
her
whilst
she
sprang
about
she
loosened
her
veil
and
took
off
her
hat
her
sparkling
eyes
hung
on
mine
and
watched
my
movements
i
made
a
fresh
sortie
and
tripped
on
the
carpet
and
fell
my
sore
foot
refusing
to
bear
me
up
any
longer
i
rose
in
extreme
confusion
lord
how
red
you
did
get
she
said
well
it
was
awfully
awkward
of
you
yes
it
was
i
agreed
and
we
began
the
chase
afresh
it
seems
to
me
you
limp
yes
perhaps
i
do
just
a
little
only
just
a
little
for
that
matter
last
time
you
had
a
sore
finger
now
you
have
got
a
sore
foot
it
is
awful
the
number
of
afflictions
you
have
ah
yes
i
was
run
over
slightly
a
few
days
ago
run
over
tipsy
again
why
good
heavens
what
a
life
you
lead
young
man
and
she
threatened
me
with
her
forefinger
and
tried
to
appear
grave
well
let
us
sit
down
then
no
not
down
there
by
the
door
you
are
far
too
reserved
come
here
you
there
and
i
here
so
it
ugh
it
such
a
bore
with
reticent
people
one
has
to
say
and
do
everything
oneself
one
gets
no
help
to
do
anything
now
for
example
you
might
just
as
well
put
your
arm
over
the
back
of
my
chair
you
could
easily
have
thought
of
that
much
out
of
your
own
head
could
you
but
if
i
say
anything
like
that
you
open
your
eyes
as
wide
as
if
you
could
believe
what
was
being
said
yes
it
is
really
true
i
have
noticed
it
several
times
you
are
doing
it
now
too
but
you
need
try
to
persuade
me
that
you
are
always
so
modest
it
is
only
when
you
do
dare
to
be
otherwise
than
quiet
you
were
daring
enough
the
day
you
were
tipsy
when
you
followed
me
straight
home
and
worried
me
with
your
witticisms
are
losing
your
book
madam
you
are
quite
certainly
losing
your
book
madam
ha
ha
ha
it
was
really
shameless
of
you
i
sat
dejectedly
and
looked
at
her
my
heart
beat
violently
my
blood
raced
quickly
through
my
veins
there
was
a
singular
sense
of
enjoyment
in
it
why
do
you
say
something
what
a
darling
you
are
i
cried
i
am
simply
sitting
here
getting
thoroughly
fascinated
by
you
here
this
very
moment
thoroughly
fascinated
there
is
no
help
for
it
you
are
the
most
extraordinary
creature
that
sometimes
your
eyes
gleam
so
that
i
never
saw
their
match
they
look
like
flowers
eh
no
well
no
perhaps
not
like
flowers
either
but
i
am
so
desperately
in
love
with
you
and
it
is
so
preposterous
for
great
scott
there
is
naturally
not
an
atom
of
a
chance
for
me
what
is
your
name
now
you
really
must
tell
me
what
you
are
called
no
what
is
name
gracious
i
was
nearly
forgetting
that
again
i
thought
about
it
all
yesterday
that
i
meant
to
ask
you
yes
that
is
to
say
not
yesterday
but
do
you
know
what
i
named
you
i
named
you
ylajali
how
do
you
like
that
it
has
a
gliding
sound
ylajali
yes
is
that
a
foreign
language
humph
no
it
is
that
either
well
it
is
ugly
after
a
long
discussion
we
told
one
another
our
names
she
seated
herself
close
to
my
side
on
the
sofa
and
shoved
the
chair
away
with
her
foot
and
we
began
to
chatter
afresh
you
are
shaved
this
evening
too
she
said
look
on
the
whole
a
little
better
than
the
last
time
that
is
to
say
only
just
a
scrap
better
do
imagine
no
the
last
time
you
were
really
shabby
and
you
had
a
dirty
rag
round
your
finger
into
the
bargain
and
in
that
state
you
absolutely
wanted
me
to
go
to
some
place
and
take
wine
with
you
thanks
not
me
so
it
was
after
all
because
of
my
miserable
appearance
that
you
would
not
go
with
me
i
said
no
she
replied
and
looked
down
no
god
knows
it
was
i
even
think
about
it
listen
said
i
you
are
evidently
sitting
here
labouring
under
the
delusion
that
i
can
dress
and
live
exactly
as
i
choose
are
you
and
that
is
just
what
i
ca
do
i
am
very
very
poor
she
looked
at
me
are
you
she
queried
yes
worse
luck
i
am
after
an
interval
well
gracious
so
am
i
too
she
said
with
a
cheerful
movement
of
her
head
every
one
of
her
words
intoxicated
me
fell
on
my
heart
like
drops
of
wine
she
enchanted
me
with
the
trick
she
had
of
putting
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
listening
when
i
said
anything
and
i
could
feel
her
breath
brush
my
face
do
you
know
i
said
that
but
now
you
must
get
angry
when
i
went
to
bed
last
night
i
settled
this
arm
for
you
so
as
if
you
lay
on
it
and
then
i
went
to
sleep
did
you
that
was
lovely
a
pause
but
of
course
it
could
only
be
from
a
distance
that
you
would
venture
to
do
such
a
thing
for
otherwise
do
you
believe
i
could
do
it
otherwise
no
i
do
believe
it
ah
from
me
you
may
expect
everything
i
said
and
i
put
my
arm
around
her
waist
can
i
was
all
she
said
it
annoyed
me
almost
wounded
me
that
she
should
look
upon
me
as
being
so
utterly
inoffensive
i
braced
myself
up
steeled
my
heart
and
seized
her
hand
but
she
withdrew
it
softly
and
moved
a
little
away
from
me
that
just
put
an
end
to
my
courage
again
i
felt
ashamed
and
looked
out
through
the
window
i
was
in
spite
of
all
in
far
too
wretched
a
condition
i
must
above
all
not
try
to
imagine
myself
any
one
in
particular
it
would
have
been
another
matter
if
i
had
met
her
during
the
time
that
i
still
looked
like
a
respectable
human
being
in
my
old
days
when
i
had
sufficient
to
make
an
appearance
and
i
felt
fearfully
downcast
there
now
one
can
see
she
said
now
one
can
just
see
one
can
snub
you
with
just
the
tiniest
frown
make
you
look
sheepish
by
just
moving
a
little
away
from
you
she
laughed
tantalizingly
roguishly
with
eyes
as
if
she
could
not
stand
being
looked
at
either
well
upon
my
soul
i
blurted
out
now
you
shall
just
see
and
i
flung
my
arms
violently
around
her
shoulders
i
was
mortified
was
the
girl
out
of
her
senses
did
she
think
i
was
totally
inexperienced
ha
then
i
would
by
the
living
no
one
should
say
of
me
that
i
was
backward
on
that
score
the
creature
was
possessed
by
the
devil
himself
if
it
were
only
a
matter
of
going
at
it
well
she
sat
quite
quietly
and
still
kept
her
eyes
closed
neither
of
us
spoke
i
crushed
her
fiercely
to
me
pressed
her
body
greedily
against
my
breast
and
she
spoke
never
a
word
i
heard
her
heart
beat
both
hers
and
mine
they
sounded
like
hurrying
hoofbeats
i
kissed
her
i
no
longer
knew
myself
i
uttered
some
nonsense
that
she
laughed
at
whispered
pet
names
into
her
mouth
caressed
her
cheek
kissed
her
many
times
she
winds
her
arms
about
my
neck
quite
slowly
tenderly
the
breath
of
her
pink
quivering
nostrils
fans
me
right
in
the
face
she
strokes
down
my
shoulders
with
her
left
hand
and
says
what
a
lot
of
loose
hair
there
is
yes
i
reply
what
can
be
the
reason
that
your
hair
falls
out
so
do
know
ah
of
course
because
you
drink
too
much
and
perhaps
fie
i
wo
say
it
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
no
i
would
have
believed
that
of
you
to
think
that
you
who
are
so
young
already
should
lose
your
hair
now
do
please
just
tell
me
what
sort
of
way
you
really
spend
your
life
i
am
certain
it
is
dreadful
but
only
the
truth
do
you
hear
no
evasions
anyway
i
shall
see
by
you
if
you
hide
anything
there
tell
now
yes
but
let
me
kiss
you
first
then
are
you
mad
humph
i
want
to
hear
what
kind
of
a
man
you
are
ah
i
am
sure
it
is
dreadful
it
hurt
me
that
she
should
believe
the
worst
of
me
i
was
afraid
of
thrusting
her
away
entirely
and
i
could
not
endure
the
misgivings
she
had
as
to
my
way
of
life
i
would
clear
myself
in
her
eyes
make
myself
worthy
of
her
show
her
that
she
was
sitting
at
the
side
of
a
person
almost
angelically
disposed
why
bless
me
i
could
count
my
falls
up
to
date
on
my
fingers
i
related
related
all
and
i
only
related
truth
i
made
out
nothing
any
worse
than
it
was
it
was
not
my
intention
to
rouse
her
compassion
i
told
her
also
that
i
had
stolen
five
shillings
one
evening
she
sat
and
listened
with
open
mouth
pale
frightened
her
shining
eyes
completely
bewildered
i
desired
to
make
it
good
again
to
disperse
the
sad
impression
i
had
made
and
i
pulled
myself
up
well
it
is
all
over
now
i
said
there
can
be
no
talk
of
such
a
thing
happening
again
i
am
saved
now
but
she
was
much
dispirited
the
lord
preserve
me
was
all
she
said
then
kept
silent
she
repeated
this
at
short
intervals
and
kept
silent
after
each
the
lord
preserve
me
i
began
to
jest
caught
hold
of
her
tried
to
tickle
her
lifted
her
up
to
my
breast
i
was
irritated
not
a
little
indeed
downright
hurt
was
i
more
unworthy
in
her
eyes
now
than
if
i
had
myself
been
instrumental
in
causing
the
falling
out
of
my
hair
would
she
have
thought
more
of
me
if
i
had
made
myself
out
to
be
a
no
nonsense
now
it
was
just
a
matter
of
going
at
it
and
if
it
was
only
just
a
matter
of
going
at
it
so
by
the
living
no
what
do
you
want
she
queried
and
she
added
these
distressing
words
i
ca
be
sure
that
you
are
not
insane
i
checked
myself
involuntarily
and
i
said
you
do
mean
that
indeed
god
knows
i
do
you
look
so
strangely
and
the
forenoon
you
followed
me
after
all
you
were
tipsy
that
time
no
but
i
was
hungry
then
either
i
had
just
eaten
yes
but
that
made
it
so
much
the
worse
would
you
rather
i
had
been
tipsy
yes
ugh
i
am
afraid
of
you
lord
ca
you
let
me
be
now
i
considered
a
moment
no
i
could
let
her
be
i
happened
as
if
inadvertently
to
knock
over
the
light
so
that
it
went
out
she
made
a
despairing
struggle
gave
vent
at
last
to
a
little
whimper
no
not
that
if
you
like
you
may
rather
kiss
me
oh
dear
kind
i
stopped
instantly
her
words
sounded
so
terrified
so
helpless
i
was
struck
to
the
heart
she
meant
to
offer
me
a
compensation
by
giving
me
leave
to
kiss
her
how
charming
how
charmingly
naïve
i
could
have
fallen
down
and
knelt
before
her
but
dear
pretty
one
i
said
completely
bewildered
i
understand
i
really
ca
conceive
what
sort
of
a
game
this
is
she
rose
lit
the
candle
again
with
trembling
hands
i
leant
back
on
the
sofa
and
did
nothing
what
would
happen
now
i
was
in
reality
very
ill
at
ease
she
cast
a
look
over
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
and
started
ugh
the
girl
will
soon
come
now
she
said
this
was
the
first
thing
she
said
i
took
the
hint
and
rose
she
took
up
her
jacket
as
if
to
put
it
on
bethought
herself
and
let
it
lie
and
went
over
to
the
fireplace
so
that
it
should
not
appear
as
if
she
had
shown
me
the
door
i
said
was
your
father
in
the
army
and
at
the
same
time
i
prepared
to
leave
yes
he
was
an
officer
how
did
you
know
i
did
know
it
just
came
into
my
head
that
was
odd
ah
yes
there
were
some
places
i
came
to
where
i
got
a
kind
of
presentiment
ha
ha
a
part
of
my
insanity
eh
she
looked
quickly
up
but
did
answer
i
felt
i
worried
her
with
my
presence
and
determined
to
make
short
work
of
it
i
went
towards
the
door
would
she
not
kiss
me
any
more
now
not
even
give
me
her
hand
i
stood
and
waited
are
you
going
now
then
she
said
and
yet
she
remained
quietly
standing
over
near
the
fireplace
i
did
not
reply
i
stood
humbly
in
confusion
and
looked
at
her
without
saying
anything
why
had
she
left
me
in
peace
when
nothing
was
to
come
of
it
what
was
the
matter
with
her
now
it
did
seem
to
put
her
out
that
i
stood
prepared
to
leave
she
was
all
at
once
completely
lost
to
me
and
i
searched
for
something
to
say
to
her
in
farewell
a
weighty
cutting
word
that
would
strike
her
and
perhaps
impress
her
a
little
and
in
the
face
of
my
first
resolve
hurt
as
i
was
instead
of
being
proud
and
cold
disturbed
and
offended
i
began
right
off
to
talk
of
trifles
the
telling
word
would
not
come
i
conducted
myself
in
an
exceedingly
aimless
fashion
why
could
she
just
as
well
tell
me
plainly
and
straightly
to
go
my
way
i
queried
yes
indeed
why
not
there
was
no
need
of
feeling
embarrassed
about
it
instead
of
reminding
me
that
the
girl
would
soon
come
home
she
could
have
simply
said
as
follows
now
you
must
run
for
i
must
go
and
fetch
my
mother
and
i
wo
have
your
escort
through
the
street
so
it
was
not
that
she
had
been
thinking
about
ah
yes
it
was
that
all
the
same
she
had
thought
about
i
understood
that
at
once
it
did
not
require
much
to
put
me
on
the
right
track
only
just
the
way
she
had
taken
up
her
jacket
and
left
it
down
again
had
convinced
me
immediately
as
i
said
before
i
had
presentiments
and
it
was
not
altogether
insanity
that
was
at
the
root
of
it
but
great
heavens
do
forgive
me
for
that
word
it
slipped
out
of
my
mouth
she
cried
but
yet
she
stood
quite
quietly
and
did
not
come
over
to
me
i
was
inflexible
and
went
on
i
stood
there
and
prattled
with
the
painful
consciousness
that
i
bored
her
that
not
one
of
my
words
went
home
and
all
the
same
i
did
not
cease
at
bottom
one
might
be
a
fairly
sensitive
nature
even
if
one
were
not
insane
i
ventured
to
say
there
were
natures
that
fed
on
trifles
and
died
just
for
one
hard
word
sake
and
i
implied
that
i
had
such
a
nature
the
fact
was
that
my
poverty
had
in
that
degree
sharpened
certain
powers
in
me
so
that
they
caused
me
unpleasantness
yes
i
assure
you
honestly
unpleasantness
worse
luck
but
this
had
also
its
advantages
it
helped
me
in
certain
situations
in
life
the
poor
intelligent
man
is
a
far
nicer
observer
than
the
rich
intelligent
man
the
poor
man
looks
about
him
at
every
step
he
takes
listens
suspiciously
to
every
word
he
hears
from
the
people
he
meets
every
step
he
takes
affords
in
this
way
a
task
for
his
thoughts
and
feelings
an
occupation
he
is
quick
of
hearing
and
sensitive
he
is
an
experienced
man
his
soul
bears
the
sears
of
the
fire
and
i
talked
a
long
time
over
these
sears
my
soul
had
but
the
longer
i
talked
the
more
troubled
she
grew
at
last
she
muttered
my
god
a
couple
of
times
in
despair
and
wrung
her
hands
i
could
see
well
that
i
tormented
her
and
i
had
no
wish
to
torment
her
but
did
it
all
the
same
at
last
being
of
the
opinion
that
i
had
succeeded
in
telling
her
in
rude
enough
terms
the
essentials
of
what
i
had
to
say
i
was
touched
by
her
expression
i
cried
now
i
am
going
now
i
am
going
ca
you
see
that
i
already
have
my
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
i
say
you
might
answer
me
when
i
say
twice
and
stand
on
the
point
of
going
i
do
even
ask
to
meet
you
again
for
it
would
torment
you
but
tell
me
why
did
you
leave
me
in
peace
what
had
i
done
to
you
i
get
in
your
way
now
did
i
why
did
you
turn
away
from
me
all
at
once
as
if
you
did
know
me
any
longer
you
have
plucked
me
now
so
thoroughly
bare
made
me
even
more
wretched
than
i
ever
was
at
any
time
before
but
indeed
i
am
not
insane
you
know
well
if
you
think
it
over
that
nothing
is
the
matter
with
me
now
come
over
then
and
give
me
your
hand
or
give
me
leave
to
go
to
you
will
you
i
wo
do
you
any
harm
i
will
only
kneel
before
you
only
for
a
minute
kneel
down
on
the
floor
before
you
only
for
a
minute
may
i
no
no
there
i
am
not
to
do
it
then
i
see
you
are
getting
afraid
i
will
not
i
will
not
do
it
do
you
hear
lord
why
do
you
get
so
terrified
i
am
standing
quite
still
i
am
not
moving
i
would
have
knelt
down
on
the
carpet
for
a
moment
just
there
upon
that
patch
of
red
at
your
feet
but
you
got
frightened
i
could
see
it
at
once
in
your
eyes
that
you
got
frightened
that
was
why
i
stood
still
i
did
move
a
step
when
i
asked
you
might
i
did
i
i
stood
just
as
immovable
as
i
stand
now
when
i
point
out
the
place
to
you
where
i
would
have
knelt
before
you
over
there
on
the
crimson
rose
in
the
carpet
i
do
even
point
with
my
finger
i
do
point
at
all
i
let
it
be
not
to
frighten
you
i
only
nod
and
look
over
at
it
like
this
and
you
know
perfectly
well
which
rose
i
mean
but
you
wo
let
me
kneel
there
you
are
afraid
of
me
and
dare
not
come
near
to
me
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
could
have
the
heart
to
call
me
insane
it
is
true
you
do
believe
it
either
any
longer
it
was
once
in
the
summer
a
long
time
ago
i
was
mad
i
worked
too
hard
and
forgot
to
go
to
dine
at
the
right
hour
when
i
had
too
much
to
think
about
that
happened
day
after
day
i
ought
to
have
remembered
it
but
i
went
on
forgetting
it
by
god
in
heaven
it
is
true
god
keep
me
from
ever
coming
alive
from
this
spot
if
i
lie
there
you
can
see
you
do
me
an
injustice
it
was
not
out
of
need
i
did
it
i
can
get
credit
much
credit
at
ingebret
or
gravesen
i
often
too
had
a
good
deal
of
money
in
my
pocket
and
did
not
buy
food
all
the
same
because
i
forgot
it
do
you
hear
you
do
say
anything
you
do
answer
you
do
stir
a
bit
from
the
fire
you
just
stand
and
wait
for
me
to
go
she
came
hurriedly
over
to
me
and
stretched
out
her
hand
i
looked
at
her
full
of
mistrust
did
she
do
it
with
any
true
heartiness
or
did
she
only
do
it
to
get
rid
of
me
she
wound
her
arms
round
my
neck
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
i
only
stood
and
looked
at
her
she
offered
her
mouth
i
could
believe
in
her
it
was
quite
certain
she
was
making
a
sacrifice
as
a
means
of
putting
an
end
to
all
this
she
said
something
it
sounded
to
me
like
i
am
fond
of
you
in
spite
of
all
she
said
it
very
lowly
and
indistinctly
maybe
i
did
not
hear
aright
she
may
not
have
said
just
those
words
but
she
cast
herself
impetuously
against
my
breast
clasped
both
her
arms
about
my
neck
for
a
little
while
stretched
even
up
a
bit
on
her
toes
to
get
a
good
hold
and
stood
so
for
perhaps
a
whole
minute
i
was
afraid
that
she
was
forcing
herself
to
show
me
this
tenderness
and
i
only
said
what
a
darling
you
are
now
more
i
did
say
i
crushed
her
in
my
arms
stepped
back
rushed
to
the
door
and
went
out
backwards
she
remained
in
there
behind
me
part
iv
winter
had
set
in
a
raw
wet
winter
almost
without
snow
a
foggy
dark
and
everlasting
night
without
a
single
blast
of
fresh
wind
the
whole
week
through
the
gas
was
lighted
almost
all
the
day
in
the
streets
and
yet
people
jostled
one
another
in
the
fog
every
sound
the
clang
of
the
church
bells
the
jingling
of
the
harness
of
the
droske
horses
the
people
voices
the
beat
of
the
hoofs
everything
sounded
choked
and
jangling
through
the
close
air
that
penetrated
and
muffled
everything
week
followed
week
and
the
weather
was
and
remained
still
the
same
and
i
stayed
steadily
down
in
vaterland
i
grew
more
and
more
closely
bound
to
this
inn
this
for
travellers
where
i
had
found
shelter
in
spite
of
my
starving
condition
my
money
was
exhausted
long
since
and
yet
i
continued
to
come
and
go
in
this
place
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
it
and
was
at
home
there
the
landlady
had
as
yet
said
nothing
but
it
worried
me
all
the
same
that
i
could
not
pay
her
in
this
way
three
weeks
went
by
i
had
already
many
days
ago
taken
to
writing
again
but
i
could
not
succeed
in
putting
anything
together
that
satisfied
me
i
had
not
longer
any
luck
although
i
was
very
painstaking
and
strove
early
and
late
no
matter
what
i
attempted
it
was
useless
good
fortune
had
flown
and
i
exerted
myself
in
vain
it
was
in
a
room
on
the
second
floor
the
best
that
i
sat
and
made
these
attempts
i
had
been
undisturbed
up
there
since
the
first
evening
when
i
had
money
and
was
able
to
settle
for
what
i
got
all
the
time
i
was
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
of
at
last
succeeding
in
getting
together
an
article
on
some
subject
or
another
so
that
i
could
pay
for
my
room
and
for
whatever
else
i
owed
that
was
the
reason
i
worked
on
so
persistently
i
had
in
particular
commenced
a
piece
from
which
i
expected
great
things
an
allegory
about
a
fire
a
profound
thought
upon
which
i
intended
to
expend
all
my
energy
and
bring
it
to
the
commandor
in
payment
the
commandor
should
see
that
he
had
helped
a
talent
this
time
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
would
eventually
see
that
it
only
was
a
matter
of
waiting
till
the
spirit
moved
me
and
why
should
the
spirit
move
me
why
should
it
not
come
over
me
even
now
at
a
very
early
date
there
was
no
longer
anything
the
matter
with
me
my
landlady
gave
me
a
little
food
every
day
some
bread
and
butter
mornings
and
evenings
and
my
nervousness
had
almost
flown
i
no
longer
used
cloths
round
my
hands
when
i
wrote
and
i
could
stare
down
into
the
street
from
my
window
on
the
second
floor
without
getting
giddy
i
was
much
better
in
every
way
and
it
was
becoming
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
me
that
i
had
not
already
finished
my
allegory
i
could
understand
why
it
was
but
a
day
came
when
i
was
at
last
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
how
weak
i
had
really
become
with
what
incapacity
my
dull
brain
acted
namely
on
this
day
my
landlady
came
up
to
me
with
a
reckoning
which
she
asked
me
to
look
over
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
this
reckoning
she
said
it
did
agree
with
her
own
book
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
find
out
the
mistake
i
set
to
work
to
add
up
my
landlady
sat
right
opposite
and
looked
at
me
i
added
up
these
score
of
figures
first
once
down
and
found
the
total
right
then
once
up
again
and
arrived
at
the
same
result
i
looked
at
the
woman
sitting
opposite
me
waiting
on
my
words
i
noticed
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
pregnant
it
did
not
escape
my
attention
and
yet
i
did
not
stare
in
any
way
scrutinizingly
at
her
the
total
is
right
said
i
no
go
over
each
figure
now
she
answered
i
am
sure
it
ca
be
so
much
i
am
positive
of
it
and
i
commenced
to
check
each
line
loaves
at
lamp
chimney
soap
butter
it
did
not
require
any
particularly
shrewd
head
to
run
up
these
rows
of
figures
this
little
huckster
account
in
which
nothing
very
complex
occurred
i
tried
honestly
to
find
the
error
that
the
woman
spoke
about
but
succeed
after
i
had
muddled
about
with
these
figures
for
some
minutes
i
felt
that
unfortunately
everything
commenced
to
dance
about
in
my
head
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
debit
or
credit
i
mixed
the
whole
thing
up
finally
i
came
to
a
dead
stop
at
the
following
entry
of
a
pound
of
cheese
at
my
brain
failed
me
completely
i
stared
stupidly
down
at
the
cheese
and
got
no
farther
it
is
really
too
confoundedly
crabbed
writing
i
exclaimed
in
despair
why
god
bless
me
here
is
of
a
pound
of
cheese
entered
ha
ha
did
any
one
ever
hear
the
like
yes
look
here
you
can
see
for
yourself
yes
she
said
it
is
often
put
down
like
that
it
is
a
kind
of
dutch
cheese
yes
that
is
all
right
is
in
this
case
five
ounces
yes
yes
i
understand
that
well
enough
i
interrupted
although
in
truth
i
understood
nothing
more
whatever
i
tried
once
more
to
get
this
little
account
right
that
i
could
have
totted
up
in
a
second
some
months
ago
i
sweated
fearfully
and
thought
over
these
enigmatical
figures
with
all
my
might
and
i
blinked
my
eyes
reflectingly
as
if
i
was
studying
this
matter
sharply
but
i
had
to
give
it
up
these
five
ounces
of
cheese
finished
me
completely
it
was
as
if
something
snapped
within
my
forehead
but
yet
to
give
the
impression
that
i
still
worked
out
my
calculation
i
moved
my
lips
and
muttered
a
number
aloud
all
the
while
sliding
farther
and
farther
down
the
reckoning
as
if
i
were
steadily
coming
to
a
result
she
sat
and
waited
at
last
i
said
well
now
i
have
gone
through
it
from
first
to
last
and
there
is
no
mistake
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
there
replied
the
woman
is
there
really
but
i
saw
well
that
she
did
not
believe
me
and
she
seemed
all
at
once
to
throw
a
dash
of
contempt
into
her
words
a
slightly
careless
tone
that
i
had
never
heard
from
her
before
she
remarked
that
perhaps
i
was
not
accustomed
to
reckon
in
sixteenths
she
mentioned
also
that
she
must
only
apply
to
some
one
who
had
a
knowledge
of
sixteenths
to
get
the
account
properly
revised
she
said
all
this
not
in
any
hurtful
way
to
make
me
feel
ashamed
but
thoughtfully
and
seriously
when
she
got
as
far
as
the
door
she
said
without
looking
at
me
excuse
me
for
taking
up
your
time
then
off
she
went
a
moment
after
the
door
opened
again
and
she
she
could
hardly
have
gone
much
farther
than
the
stairs
before
she
had
turned
back
that
true
said
she
you
must
take
it
amiss
but
there
is
a
little
owing
to
me
from
you
now
is
there
was
it
three
weeks
yesterday
since
you
came
yes
i
thought
it
was
it
is
so
easy
to
keep
things
going
with
such
a
big
family
so
that
i
ca
give
lodging
on
credit
more
the
i
stopped
her
i
am
working
at
an
article
that
i
think
i
told
you
about
before
said
i
and
as
soon
as
ever
that
is
finished
you
shall
have
your
money
you
can
make
yourself
quite
easy
yes
but
you
never
get
that
article
finished
though
do
you
think
that
maybe
the
spirit
will
move
me
tomorrow
or
perhaps
already
tonight
it
is
at
all
impossible
but
that
it
may
move
me
some
time
tonight
and
then
my
article
will
be
completed
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
outside
you
see
it
is
with
my
work
as
with
other
people
i
ca
sit
down
and
get
a
certain
amount
finished
in
a
day
i
have
just
to
wait
for
the
right
moment
and
no
one
can
tell
the
day
or
hour
when
the
spirit
may
move
one
it
must
have
its
own
time
my
landlady
went
but
her
confidence
in
me
was
evidently
much
shaken
as
soon
as
i
was
left
alone
i
jumped
up
and
tore
my
hair
in
despair
no
in
spite
of
all
there
was
really
no
salvation
for
me
no
salvation
my
brain
was
bankrupt
had
i
then
really
turned
into
a
complete
dolt
since
i
could
not
even
add
up
the
price
of
a
piece
of
dutch
cheese
but
could
it
be
possible
i
had
lost
my
senses
when
i
could
stand
and
put
such
questions
to
myself
had
not
i
into
the
bargain
right
in
the
midst
of
my
efforts
with
the
reckoning
made
the
lucid
observation
that
my
landlady
was
in
the
family
way
i
had
no
reason
for
knowing
it
no
one
had
told
me
anything
about
it
neither
had
it
occurred
to
me
gratuitously
i
sat
and
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
i
understood
it
at
once
right
at
a
despairing
moment
where
i
sat
and
added
up
sixteenths
how
could
i
explain
this
to
myself
i
went
to
the
window
and
gazed
out
it
looked
out
into
vognmandsgade
some
children
were
playing
down
on
the
pavement
poorly
dressed
children
in
the
middle
of
a
poor
street
they
tossed
an
empty
bottle
between
them
and
screamed
shrilly
a
load
of
furniture
rolled
slowly
by
it
must
belong
to
some
dislodged
family
forced
to
change
residence
between
flitting
time
footnote
in
norway
of
march
and
october
this
struck
me
at
once
and
furniture
were
heaped
on
the
float
beds
and
chests
of
drawers
chairs
with
three
legs
mats
old
iron
and
a
little
girl
a
mere
child
a
downright
ugly
youngster
with
a
running
cold
in
her
nose
sat
up
on
top
of
the
load
and
held
fast
with
her
poor
little
blue
hands
in
order
not
to
tumble
off
she
sat
on
a
heap
of
frightfully
stained
mattresses
that
children
must
have
lain
on
and
looked
down
at
the
urchins
who
were
tossing
the
empty
bottle
to
one
another
i
stood
gazing
at
all
this
i
had
no
difficulty
in
apprehending
everything
that
passed
before
me
whilst
i
stood
there
at
the
window
and
observed
this
i
could
hear
my
landlady
servant
singing
in
the
kitchen
right
alongside
of
my
room
i
knew
the
air
she
was
singing
and
i
listened
to
hear
if
she
would
sing
false
and
i
said
to
myself
that
an
idiot
could
not
have
done
all
this
i
was
god
be
praised
all
right
in
my
senses
as
any
man
suddenly
i
saw
two
of
the
children
down
in
the
street
fire
up
and
begin
to
abuse
one
another
two
little
boys
i
recognized
one
of
them
he
was
my
landlady
son
i
open
the
window
to
hear
what
they
are
saying
to
one
another
and
immediately
a
flock
of
children
crowded
together
under
my
window
and
looked
wistfully
up
what
did
they
expect
that
something
would
be
thrown
down
withered
flowers
bones
cigar
ends
or
one
thing
or
another
that
they
could
amuse
themselves
with
they
looked
up
with
their
faces
and
unspeakably
wistful
eyes
in
the
meantime
the
two
small
foes
continued
to
revile
one
another
words
like
great
buzzing
noxious
insects
swarm
out
of
their
childish
mouths
frightful
nicknames
thieves
slang
sailors
oaths
that
they
perhaps
had
learnt
down
on
the
wharf
and
they
are
both
so
engaged
that
they
do
not
notice
my
landlady
who
rushes
out
to
see
what
is
going
on
yes
explains
her
son
he
catched
me
by
the
throat
i
breaths
for
ever
so
long
and
turning
upon
the
little
man
who
is
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
and
who
is
standing
grinning
maliciously
at
him
he
gets
perfectly
furious
and
yells
go
to
hell
chaldean
ass
that
you
are
to
think
such
vermin
as
you
should
catch
folk
by
the
throat
i
will
may
the
lord
and
the
mother
this
pregnant
woman
who
dominates
the
whole
street
with
her
size
answers
the
child
as
she
seizes
him
by
the
arm
and
tries
to
drag
him
in
sh
sh
hold
your
jaw
i
just
like
to
hear
the
way
you
swear
too
as
if
you
had
been
in
a
brothel
for
years
now
in
with
you
no
i
wo
yes
you
will
no
i
wo
i
stand
up
in
the
window
and
see
that
the
mother
temper
is
rising
this
disagreeable
scene
excites
me
frightfully
i
ca
endure
it
any
longer
i
call
down
to
the
boy
to
come
up
to
me
for
a
minute
i
call
twice
just
to
distract
them
to
change
the
scene
the
last
time
i
call
very
loudly
and
the
mother
turns
round
flurriedly
and
looks
up
at
me
she
regains
her
at
once
looks
insolently
at
me
nay
downright
maliciously
and
enters
the
house
with
a
chiding
remark
to
her
offspring
she
talks
loudly
so
that
i
may
hear
it
and
says
to
him
fie
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
let
people
see
how
naughty
you
are
of
all
this
that
i
stood
there
and
observed
not
one
thing
not
even
one
little
accessory
detail
was
lost
on
me
my
attention
was
acutely
keen
i
absorbed
carefully
every
little
thing
as
i
stood
and
thought
out
my
own
thought
about
each
thing
according
as
it
occurred
so
it
was
impossible
that
there
could
be
anything
the
matter
with
my
brain
how
could
there
in
this
case
be
anything
the
matter
with
it
listen
do
you
know
what
said
i
all
at
once
to
myself
that
you
have
been
worrying
yourself
long
enough
about
your
brain
giving
yourself
no
end
of
worry
in
this
matter
now
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
tomfoolery
is
it
a
sign
of
insanity
to
notice
and
apprehend
everything
as
accurately
as
you
do
you
make
me
almost
laugh
at
you
i
reply
to
my
mind
it
is
not
without
its
humorous
side
if
i
am
any
judge
of
such
a
case
why
it
happens
to
every
man
that
he
once
in
a
way
sticks
fast
and
that
too
just
with
the
simplest
question
it
is
of
no
significance
it
is
often
a
pure
accident
as
i
have
remarked
before
i
am
on
the
point
of
having
a
good
laugh
at
your
expense
as
far
as
that
huckster
account
is
concerned
that
paltry
of
cheese
i
can
happily
dub
it
so
ha
ha
a
cheese
with
cloves
and
pepper
in
it
upon
my
word
a
cheese
in
which
to
put
the
matter
plainly
one
could
breed
maggots
as
far
as
that
ridiculous
cheese
is
concerned
it
might
happen
to
the
cleverest
fellow
in
the
world
to
be
puzzled
over
it
why
the
smell
of
the
cheese
was
enough
to
finish
a
man
and
i
made
the
greatest
fun
of
this
and
all
other
dutch
cheeses
no
set
me
to
reckon
up
something
really
eatable
said
i
set
me
if
you
like
at
of
good
dairy
butter
that
is
another
matter
i
laughed
feverishly
at
my
own
whim
and
found
it
peculiarly
diverting
there
was
positively
no
longer
anything
the
matter
with
me
i
was
in
good
form
was
so
to
say
still
in
the
best
of
form
i
had
a
level
head
nothing
was
wanting
there
god
be
praised
and
thanked
my
mirth
rose
in
measure
as
i
paced
the
floor
and
communed
with
myself
i
laughed
aloud
and
felt
amazingly
glad
besides
it
really
seemed
too
as
if
i
only
needed
this
little
happy
hour
this
moment
of
airy
rapture
without
a
care
on
any
side
to
get
my
head
into
working
order
once
more
i
seated
myself
at
the
table
and
set
to
work
at
my
allegory
it
progressed
swimmingly
better
than
it
had
done
for
a
long
time
not
very
fast
is
true
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
i
did
was
altogether
i
worked
too
for
the
space
of
an
hour
without
getting
tired
i
am
sitting
working
at
a
most
crucial
point
in
this
allegory
of
a
conflagration
in
a
bookshop
it
appears
to
me
so
momentous
a
point
that
all
the
rest
i
have
written
counted
as
nothing
in
comparison
i
was
namely
just
about
to
weave
in
in
a
downright
profound
way
this
thought
it
was
not
books
that
were
burning
it
was
brains
human
brains
and
i
intended
to
make
a
perfect
bartholomew
night
of
these
burning
brains
suddenly
my
door
was
flung
open
with
a
jerk
and
in
much
haste
my
landlady
came
sailing
in
she
came
straight
over
to
the
middle
of
the
room
she
did
not
even
pause
on
the
threshold
i
gave
a
little
hoarse
cry
it
was
just
as
if
i
had
received
a
blow
what
said
she
i
thought
you
said
something
we
have
got
a
traveller
and
we
must
have
this
room
for
him
you
will
have
to
sleep
downstairs
with
us
tonight
yes
you
can
have
a
bed
to
yourself
there
too
and
before
she
got
my
answer
she
began
without
further
ceremony
to
bundle
my
papers
together
on
the
table
and
put
the
whole
of
them
into
a
state
of
dire
confusion
my
happy
mood
was
blown
to
the
winds
i
stood
up
at
once
in
anger
and
despair
i
let
her
tidy
the
table
and
said
nothing
never
uttered
a
syllable
she
thrust
all
the
papers
into
my
hand
there
was
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
i
was
forced
to
leave
the
room
and
so
this
precious
moment
was
spoilt
also
i
met
the
new
traveller
already
on
the
stairs
a
young
man
with
great
blue
anchors
tattooed
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
a
quay
porter
followed
him
bearing
a
on
his
shoulders
he
was
evidently
a
sailor
a
casual
traveller
for
the
night
he
would
therefore
not
occupy
my
room
for
any
lengthened
period
perhaps
too
i
might
be
lucky
tomorrow
when
the
man
had
left
and
have
one
of
my
moments
again
i
only
needed
an
inspiration
for
five
minutes
and
my
essay
on
the
conflagration
would
be
completed
well
i
should
have
to
submit
to
fate
i
had
not
been
inside
the
family
rooms
before
this
one
common
room
in
which
they
all
lived
both
day
and
night
the
husband
wife
father
and
four
children
the
servant
lived
in
the
kitchen
where
she
also
slept
at
night
i
approached
the
door
with
much
repugnance
and
knocked
no
one
answered
yet
i
heard
voices
inside
the
husband
did
not
speak
as
i
stepped
in
did
not
acknowledge
my
nod
even
merely
glanced
at
me
carelessly
as
if
i
were
no
concern
of
his
besides
he
was
sitting
playing
cards
with
a
person
i
had
seen
down
on
the
quays
with
the
of
pane
o
glass
an
infant
lay
and
prattled
to
itself
over
in
the
bed
and
an
old
man
the
father
sat
doubled
together
on
a
and
bent
his
head
down
over
his
hands
as
if
his
chest
or
stomach
pained
him
his
hair
was
almost
white
and
he
looked
in
his
crouching
position
like
a
reptile
that
sat
cocking
its
ears
at
something
i
come
worse
luck
to
beg
for
down
here
tonight
i
said
to
the
man
did
my
wife
say
so
he
inquired
yes
a
new
lodger
came
to
my
room
to
this
the
man
made
no
reply
but
proceeded
to
finger
the
cards
there
this
man
sat
day
after
day
and
played
cards
with
anybody
who
happened
to
come
in
played
for
nothing
only
just
to
kill
time
and
have
something
in
hand
he
never
did
anything
else
only
moved
just
as
much
as
his
lazy
limbs
felt
inclined
whilst
his
wife
bustled
up
and
down
stairs
was
occupied
on
all
sides
and
took
care
to
draw
customers
to
the
house
she
had
put
herself
in
connection
with
and
to
whom
she
paid
a
certain
sum
for
every
new
lodger
they
brought
her
and
she
often
gave
them
in
addition
a
shelter
for
the
night
this
time
it
was
pane
o
glass
that
had
just
brought
along
the
new
lodger
a
couple
of
the
children
came
in
two
little
girls
with
thin
freckled
faces
their
clothes
were
positively
wretched
a
while
after
the
landlady
herself
entered
i
asked
her
where
she
intended
to
put
me
up
for
the
night
and
she
replied
that
i
could
lie
in
here
together
with
the
others
or
out
in
the
on
the
sofa
as
i
thought
fit
whilst
she
answered
me
she
fussed
about
the
room
and
busied
herself
with
different
things
that
she
set
in
order
and
she
never
once
looked
at
me
my
spirits
were
crushed
by
her
reply
i
stood
down
near
the
door
and
made
myself
small
tried
to
make
it
appear
as
if
i
were
quite
content
all
the
same
to
change
my
room
for
another
for
one
night
sake
i
put
on
a
friendly
face
on
purpose
not
to
irritate
her
and
perhaps
be
hustled
right
out
of
the
house
ah
yes
i
said
there
is
sure
to
be
some
way
and
then
held
my
tongue
she
still
bustled
about
the
room
for
that
matter
i
may
as
well
just
tell
you
that
i
ca
afford
to
give
people
credit
for
their
board
and
lodging
said
she
and
i
told
you
that
before
too
yes
but
my
dear
woman
it
is
only
for
these
few
days
until
i
get
my
article
finished
i
answered
and
i
will
willingly
give
you
an
extra
five
shillings
willingly
but
she
had
evidently
no
faith
in
my
article
i
could
see
that
and
i
could
not
afford
to
be
proud
and
leave
the
house
just
for
a
slight
mortification
i
knew
what
awaited
me
if
i
went
out
a
few
days
passed
over
i
still
associated
with
the
family
below
for
it
was
too
cold
in
the
where
there
was
no
stove
i
slept
too
at
night
on
the
floor
of
the
room
the
strange
sailor
continued
to
lodge
in
my
room
and
did
not
seem
like
moving
very
quickly
at
noon
too
my
landlady
came
in
and
related
how
he
had
paid
her
a
month
in
advance
and
besides
he
was
going
to
take
his
examination
before
leaving
that
was
why
he
was
staying
in
town
i
stood
and
listened
to
this
and
understood
that
my
room
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
i
went
out
to
the
and
sat
down
if
i
were
lucky
enough
to
get
anything
written
it
would
have
perforce
to
be
here
where
it
was
quiet
it
was
no
longer
the
allegory
that
occupied
me
i
had
got
a
new
idea
a
perfectly
splendid
plot
i
would
compose
a
drama
the
sign
of
the
cross
subject
taken
from
the
middle
ages
i
had
especially
thought
out
everything
in
connection
with
the
principal
characters
a
magnificently
fanatical
harlot
who
had
sinned
in
the
temple
not
from
weakness
or
desire
but
for
hate
against
heaven
sinner
right
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
with
the
under
her
head
just
out
of
delicious
contempt
for
heaven
i
grew
more
and
more
obsessed
by
this
creation
as
the
hours
went
on
she
stood
at
last
palpably
vividly
embodied
before
my
eyes
and
was
exactly
as
i
wished
her
to
appear
her
body
was
to
be
deformed
and
repulsive
tall
very
lean
and
rather
dark
and
when
she
walked
her
long
limbs
should
gleam
through
her
draperies
at
every
stride
she
took
she
was
also
to
have
large
outstanding
ears
curtly
she
was
nothing
for
the
eye
to
dwell
upon
barely
endurable
to
look
at
what
interested
me
in
her
was
her
wonderful
shamelessness
the
desperately
full
measure
of
calculated
sin
which
she
had
committed
she
really
occupied
me
too
much
my
brain
was
absolutely
inflated
by
this
singular
monstrosity
of
a
creature
and
i
worked
for
two
hours
without
a
pause
at
my
drama
when
i
had
finished
score
of
pages
perhaps
twelve
often
with
much
effort
at
times
with
long
intervals
in
which
i
wrote
in
vain
and
had
to
tear
the
page
in
two
i
had
become
tired
quite
stiff
with
cold
and
fatigue
and
i
arose
and
went
out
into
the
street
for
the
last
too
i
had
been
disturbed
by
the
crying
of
the
children
inside
the
family
room
so
that
i
could
not
in
any
case
have
written
any
more
just
then
so
i
took
a
long
time
up
over
drammensveien
and
stayed
away
till
the
evening
pondering
incessantly
as
i
walked
along
as
to
how
i
would
continue
my
drama
before
i
came
home
in
the
evening
of
this
day
the
following
happened
i
stood
outside
a
shoemaker
shop
far
down
in
carl
johann
street
almost
at
the
railway
square
god
knows
why
i
stood
just
outside
this
shoemaker
shop
i
looked
into
the
window
as
i
stood
there
but
did
not
by
the
way
remember
that
i
needed
shoes
then
my
thoughts
were
far
away
in
other
parts
of
the
world
a
swarm
of
people
talking
together
passed
behind
my
back
and
i
heard
nothing
of
what
was
said
then
a
voice
greeted
me
loudly
it
was
missy
who
bade
me
i
answered
at
random
i
looked
at
him
too
for
a
while
before
i
recognized
him
well
how
are
you
getting
along
he
inquired
oh
always
well
as
usual
by
the
way
tell
me
said
he
are
you
then
still
with
christie
christie
i
thought
you
once
said
you
were
at
christie
ah
yes
no
that
is
done
with
it
was
impossible
to
get
along
with
that
fellow
that
came
to
an
end
very
quickly
of
its
own
accord
why
so
well
i
happened
to
make
a
one
day
and
so
a
false
entry
eh
false
entry
there
stood
missy
and
asked
me
straight
in
the
face
if
i
had
done
this
thing
he
even
asked
eagerly
and
evidently
with
much
interest
i
looked
at
him
felt
deeply
insulted
and
made
no
reply
yes
well
lord
that
might
happen
to
the
best
fellow
he
said
as
if
to
console
me
he
still
believed
i
had
made
a
false
entry
designedly
what
is
it
that
well
lord
indeed
might
happen
to
the
best
fellow
i
inquired
to
do
that
listen
my
good
man
do
you
stand
there
and
really
believe
that
i
could
for
a
moment
be
guilty
of
such
a
mean
trick
as
that
i
but
my
dear
fellow
i
thought
i
heard
you
distinctly
say
that
no
i
said
that
i
had
made
a
once
a
bagatelle
if
you
want
to
know
a
false
date
on
a
letter
a
single
stroke
of
the
pen
wrong
that
was
my
whole
crime
no
god
be
praised
i
can
tell
right
from
wrong
yet
a
while
how
would
it
fare
with
me
if
i
were
into
the
bargain
to
sully
my
honour
it
is
simply
my
sense
of
honour
that
keeps
me
afloat
now
but
it
is
strong
enough
too
at
least
it
has
kept
me
up
to
date
i
threw
back
my
head
turned
away
from
missy
and
looked
down
the
street
my
eyes
rested
on
a
red
dress
that
came
towards
us
on
a
woman
at
a
man
side
if
i
had
not
had
this
conversation
with
missy
i
would
not
have
been
hurt
by
his
coarse
suspicion
and
i
would
not
have
given
this
toss
of
my
head
as
i
turned
away
in
offence
and
so
perhaps
this
red
dress
would
have
passed
me
without
my
having
noticed
it
and
at
bottom
what
did
it
concern
me
what
was
it
to
me
if
it
were
the
dress
of
the
hon
miss
nagel
the
missy
stood
and
talked
and
tried
to
make
good
his
mistake
again
i
did
not
listen
to
him
at
all
i
stood
the
whole
time
and
stared
at
the
red
dress
that
was
coming
nearer
up
the
street
and
a
stir
thrilled
through
my
breast
a
gliding
delicate
dart
i
whispered
in
thought
without
moving
my
lips
ylajali
now
missy
turned
round
also
and
noticed
the
two
the
lady
and
the
man
with
her
raised
his
hat
to
them
and
followed
them
with
his
eyes
i
did
not
raise
my
hat
or
perhaps
i
did
unconsciously
the
red
dress
glided
up
carl
johann
and
disappeared
who
was
it
was
with
her
asked
missy
the
duke
did
you
see
the
did
you
know
the
lady
yes
in
a
sort
of
way
did
you
know
her
no
i
replied
it
appears
to
me
you
saluted
profoundly
enough
did
i
ha
ha
perhaps
you
did
said
missy
well
that
is
odd
why
it
was
only
at
you
she
looked
too
the
whole
time
when
did
you
get
to
know
her
i
asked
he
did
not
really
know
her
it
dated
from
an
evening
in
autumn
it
was
late
they
were
three
jovial
souls
together
they
came
out
late
from
the
grand
and
met
this
being
going
along
alone
past
cammermeyer
and
they
addressed
her
at
first
she
answered
rebuffingly
but
one
of
the
jovial
spirits
a
man
who
neither
feared
fire
nor
water
asked
her
right
to
her
face
if
he
might
not
have
the
civilized
enjoyment
of
accompanying
her
home
he
would
by
the
lord
not
hurt
a
hair
on
her
head
as
the
saying
goes
only
go
with
her
to
her
door
reassure
himself
that
she
reached
home
in
safety
otherwise
he
could
not
rest
all
night
he
talked
incessantly
as
they
went
along
hit
upon
one
thing
or
another
dubbed
himself
waldemar
atterdag
and
represented
himself
as
a
photographer
at
last
she
was
obliged
to
laugh
at
this
merry
soul
who
refused
to
be
rebuffed
by
her
coldness
and
it
finally
ended
by
his
going
with
her
indeed
did
it
and
what
came
of
it
i
inquired
and
i
held
my
breath
for
his
reply
came
of
it
oh
stop
there
there
is
the
lady
in
question
we
both
kept
silent
a
moment
both
missy
and
i
well
i
hanged
was
that
duke
so
that
what
he
looks
like
he
added
reflectively
well
if
she
is
in
contact
with
that
fellow
well
then
i
would
like
to
answer
for
her
i
still
kept
silent
yes
of
course
the
duke
would
make
the
pace
with
her
well
what
odds
how
did
it
concern
me
i
bade
her
with
all
her
wiles
a
i
bade
her
and
i
tried
to
console
myself
by
thinking
the
worst
thoughts
about
her
took
a
downright
pleasure
in
dragging
her
through
the
mire
it
only
annoyed
me
to
think
that
i
had
doffed
my
hat
to
the
pair
if
i
really
had
done
so
why
should
i
raise
my
hat
to
such
people
i
did
not
care
for
her
any
longer
certainly
not
she
was
no
longer
in
the
very
slightest
degree
lovely
to
me
she
had
fallen
off
ah
the
devil
knows
how
soiled
i
found
her
it
might
easily
have
been
the
case
that
it
was
only
me
she
looked
at
i
was
not
in
the
least
astounded
at
that
it
might
be
regret
that
began
to
stir
in
her
but
that
was
no
reason
for
me
to
go
and
lower
myself
and
salute
like
a
fool
especially
when
she
had
become
so
seriously
besmirched
of
late
the
duke
was
welcome
to
her
i
wish
him
joy
the
day
might
come
when
i
would
just
take
into
my
head
to
pass
her
haughtily
by
without
glancing
once
towards
her
ay
it
might
happen
that
i
would
venture
to
do
this
even
if
she
were
to
gaze
straight
into
my
eyes
and
have
a
gown
on
into
the
bargain
it
might
very
easily
happen
ha
ha
that
would
be
a
triumph
if
i
knew
myself
aright
i
was
quite
capable
of
completing
my
drama
during
the
course
of
the
night
and
before
eight
days
had
flown
i
would
have
brought
this
young
woman
to
her
knees
with
all
her
charms
ha
ha
with
all
her
charms
i
muttered
shortly
but
missy
held
me
back
he
queried
but
what
do
you
do
all
day
now
do
i
write
naturally
what
else
should
i
do
is
it
not
that
i
live
by
for
the
moment
i
am
working
at
a
great
drama
sign
of
the
cross
theme
taken
from
the
middle
ages
by
jove
exclaimed
missy
seriously
well
if
you
succeed
with
that
why
i
have
no
great
anxiety
on
that
score
i
replied
in
eight
time
or
so
i
think
you
and
all
the
folks
will
have
heard
a
little
more
of
me
with
that
i
left
him
when
i
got
home
i
applied
at
once
to
my
landlady
and
requested
a
lamp
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
to
get
this
lamp
i
would
not
go
to
bed
tonight
my
drama
was
raging
in
my
brain
and
i
hoped
so
surely
to
be
able
to
write
a
good
portion
of
it
before
morning
i
put
forward
my
request
very
humbly
to
her
as
i
had
noticed
that
she
made
a
dissatisfied
face
on
my
the
i
said
that
i
had
almost
completed
a
remarkable
drama
only
a
couple
of
scenes
were
wanting
and
i
hinted
that
it
might
be
produced
in
some
theatre
or
another
in
no
time
if
she
would
only
just
render
me
this
great
service
now
but
madam
had
no
lamp
she
considered
a
bit
but
could
not
call
to
mind
that
she
had
a
lamp
in
any
place
if
i
liked
to
wait
until
twelve
i
might
perhaps
get
the
kitchen
lamp
why
did
i
buy
myself
a
candle
i
held
my
tongue
i
had
a
farthing
to
buy
a
candle
and
knew
that
right
well
of
course
i
was
foiled
again
the
sat
inside
with
us
simply
sat
in
the
and
was
not
in
the
kitchen
at
all
so
that
the
lamp
up
there
was
not
even
lit
and
i
stood
and
thought
over
this
but
said
no
more
suddenly
the
girl
remarked
to
me
i
thought
i
saw
you
come
out
of
the
palace
a
while
ago
were
you
at
a
dinner
party
and
she
laughed
loudly
at
this
jest
i
sat
down
took
out
my
papers
and
attempted
to
write
something
here
in
the
meantime
i
held
the
paper
on
my
knees
and
gazed
persistently
at
the
floor
to
avoid
being
distracted
by
anything
but
it
helped
not
a
whit
nothing
helped
me
i
got
no
farther
the
landlady
two
little
girls
came
in
and
made
a
row
with
the
cat
a
queer
sick
cat
that
had
scarcely
a
hair
on
it
they
blew
into
its
eyes
until
water
sprang
out
of
them
and
trickled
down
its
nose
the
landlord
and
a
couple
of
others
sat
at
a
table
and
played
et
the
wife
alone
was
busy
as
ever
and
sat
and
sewed
at
some
garment
she
saw
well
that
i
could
not
write
anything
in
the
midst
of
all
this
disturbance
but
she
troubled
herself
no
more
about
me
she
even
smiled
when
the
asked
me
if
i
had
been
out
to
dine
the
whole
household
had
become
hostile
towards
me
it
was
as
if
i
had
only
needed
disgrace
of
being
obliged
to
resign
my
room
to
a
stranger
to
be
treated
as
a
man
of
no
account
even
the
servant
a
little
with
a
big
fringe
over
her
forehead
and
a
perfectly
flat
bosom
poked
fun
at
me
in
the
evening
when
i
got
my
ration
of
bread
and
butter
she
inquired
perpetually
where
then
was
i
in
the
habit
of
dining
as
she
had
never
seen
me
picking
my
teeth
outside
the
grand
it
was
clear
that
she
was
aware
of
my
wretched
circumstances
and
took
a
pleasure
in
letting
me
know
of
it
i
fall
suddenly
into
thought
over
all
this
and
am
not
able
to
find
a
solitary
speech
for
my
drama
time
upon
time
i
seek
in
vain
a
strange
buzzing
begins
inside
my
head
and
i
give
it
up
i
thrust
the
papers
into
my
pocket
and
look
up
the
girl
is
sitting
straight
opposite
me
i
look
at
her
look
at
her
narrow
back
and
drooping
shoulders
that
are
not
yet
fully
developed
what
business
was
it
of
hers
to
fly
at
me
even
supposing
i
did
come
out
of
the
palace
what
then
did
it
harm
her
in
any
way
she
had
laughed
insolently
in
the
past
few
days
at
me
when
i
was
a
bit
awkward
and
stumbled
on
the
stairs
or
caught
fast
on
a
nail
and
tore
my
coat
it
was
not
later
than
yesterday
that
she
gathered
up
my
rough
copy
that
i
had
thrown
aside
in
the
stolen
these
rejected
fragments
of
my
drama
and
read
them
aloud
in
the
room
here
made
fun
of
them
in
every
one
hearing
just
to
amuse
herself
at
my
expense
i
had
never
molested
her
in
any
way
and
could
not
recall
that
i
had
ever
asked
her
to
do
me
a
service
on
the
contrary
i
made
up
my
bed
on
the
floor
in
the
myself
in
order
not
to
give
her
any
trouble
with
it
she
made
fun
of
me
too
because
my
hair
fell
out
hair
lay
and
floated
about
in
the
basin
i
washed
in
the
mornings
and
she
made
merry
over
it
then
my
shoes
too
had
grown
rather
shabby
of
late
particularly
the
one
that
had
been
run
over
by
the
and
she
found
subject
for
jesting
in
them
god
bless
you
and
your
shoes
said
she
looking
at
them
they
are
as
wide
as
a
dog
house
and
she
was
right
they
were
trodden
out
but
then
i
could
procure
myself
any
others
just
at
present
whilst
i
sit
and
call
all
this
to
mind
and
marvel
over
the
evident
malice
of
the
servant
the
little
girls
have
begun
to
tease
the
old
man
over
in
the
bed
they
are
jumping
around
him
fully
bent
on
this
diversion
they
both
found
a
straw
which
they
poked
into
his
ears
i
looked
on
at
this
for
a
while
and
refrained
from
interfering
the
old
fellow
did
not
move
a
finger
to
defend
himself
he
only
looked
at
his
tormentors
with
furious
eyes
each
time
they
prodded
him
and
jerked
his
head
to
escape
when
the
straws
were
already
in
his
ears
i
got
more
and
more
irritated
at
this
sight
and
could
not
keep
my
eyes
away
from
it
the
father
looked
up
from
his
cards
and
laughed
at
the
youngsters
he
also
drew
the
attention
of
his
comrades
at
play
to
what
was
going
on
why
did
the
old
fellow
move
why
did
he
fling
the
children
aside
with
his
arms
i
took
a
stride
and
approached
the
bed
let
them
alone
let
them
alone
he
is
paralysed
called
the
landlord
and
out
of
fear
to
be
shown
the
door
for
the
night
simply
out
of
fear
of
rousing
the
man
displeasure
by
interfering
with
this
scene
i
stepped
back
silently
to
my
old
place
and
kept
myself
quiet
why
should
i
risk
my
lodging
and
my
portion
of
bread
and
butter
by
poking
my
nose
into
the
family
squabbles
no
idiotic
pranks
for
the
sake
of
a
old
man
and
i
stood
and
felt
as
delightfully
hard
as
a
flint
the
little
urchins
did
not
cease
their
plaguing
it
amused
them
that
the
old
chap
could
not
hold
his
head
quiet
and
they
aimed
at
his
eyes
and
nostrils
he
stared
at
them
with
a
ludicrous
expression
he
said
nothing
and
could
not
stir
his
arms
suddenly
he
raised
the
upper
part
of
his
body
a
little
and
spat
in
the
face
of
one
of
the
little
girls
drew
himself
up
again
and
spat
at
the
other
but
did
not
reach
her
i
stood
and
looked
on
saw
that
the
landlord
flung
the
cards
on
the
table
at
which
he
sat
and
sprang
over
towards
the
bed
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
shouted
will
you
sit
and
spit
right
into
people
eyes
you
old
boar
but
good
lord
he
got
no
peace
from
them
i
cried
beside
myself
but
all
the
time
i
stood
in
fear
of
being
turned
out
and
i
certainly
did
not
utter
my
protest
with
any
particular
force
i
only
trembled
over
my
whole
body
with
irritation
he
turned
towards
me
and
said
eh
listen
to
him
then
what
the
devil
is
it
to
you
you
just
keep
your
tongue
in
your
jaw
you
just
mark
what
i
tell
you
serve
you
best
but
now
the
wife
voice
made
itself
heard
and
the
house
was
filled
with
scolding
and
railing
may
god
help
me
but
i
think
you
are
mad
or
possessed
the
whole
pack
of
you
she
shrieked
if
you
want
to
stay
in
here
you
have
to
be
quiet
both
of
you
humph
it
is
enough
that
one
is
to
keep
open
house
and
food
for
vermin
but
one
is
to
have
sparring
and
rowing
and
the
devil
own
in
the
as
well
but
i
wo
have
any
more
of
it
not
if
i
know
it
sh
h
hold
your
tongues
you
brats
there
and
wipe
your
noses
too
if
you
do
i
come
and
do
it
i
never
saw
the
like
of
such
people
here
they
walk
in
out
of
the
street
without
even
a
penny
to
buy
and
begin
to
kick
up
rows
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
quarrel
with
the
people
who
own
the
house
i
do
mean
to
have
any
more
of
it
do
you
understand
that
and
you
can
go
your
way
every
one
who
does
belong
home
here
i
am
going
to
have
peace
in
my
own
quarters
i
am
i
said
nothing
i
never
opened
my
mouth
once
i
sat
down
again
next
the
door
and
listened
to
the
noise
they
all
screamed
together
even
the
children
and
the
girl
who
wanted
to
explain
how
the
whole
disturbance
commenced
if
i
only
kept
quiet
it
would
all
blow
over
sometime
it
would
surely
not
come
to
the
worst
if
i
only
did
not
utter
a
word
and
what
word
after
all
could
i
have
to
say
was
it
not
perhaps
winter
outside
and
far
advanced
into
the
night
besides
was
that
a
time
to
strike
a
blow
and
show
one
could
hold
one
own
no
folly
now
so
i
sat
still
and
made
no
attempt
to
leave
the
house
i
never
even
blushed
at
keeping
silent
never
felt
ashamed
although
i
had
almost
been
shown
the
door
i
stared
coolly
at
the
wall
where
christ
hung
in
an
oleograph
and
held
my
tongue
obstinately
during
all
the
landlady
attack
well
if
it
is
me
you
want
to
get
quit
of
there
will
be
nothing
in
the
way
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
one
of
the
as
he
stood
up
the
other
rose
as
well
no
i
did
mean
you
nor
you
either
replied
the
landlady
to
them
if
there
any
need
to
i
will
show
well
enough
who
i
mean
if
the
least
need
to
if
i
know
myself
rightly
oh
it
will
be
shown
quick
enough
who
it
is
she
talked
with
pauses
gave
me
these
thrusts
at
short
intervals
and
spun
it
out
to
make
it
clearer
and
clearer
that
it
was
me
she
meant
quiet
said
i
to
myself
only
keep
quiet
she
had
not
asked
me
to
go
not
expressly
not
in
plain
words
just
no
putting
on
side
on
my
part
no
untimely
pride
brave
it
out
that
was
really
most
singular
green
hair
on
that
christ
in
the
oleograph
it
was
not
too
unlike
green
grass
or
expressed
with
exquisite
exactitude
thick
meadow
grass
ha
a
perfectly
correct
remark
unusually
thick
meadow
grass
a
train
of
fleeting
ideas
darts
at
this
moment
through
my
head
from
green
grass
to
the
text
each
life
is
like
unto
grass
that
is
kindled
from
that
to
the
day
of
judgment
when
all
will
be
consumed
then
a
little
detour
down
to
the
earthquake
in
lisbon
about
which
something
floated
before
me
in
reference
to
a
brass
spanish
spittoon
and
an
ebony
pen
handle
that
i
had
seen
down
at
ylajali
ah
yes
all
was
transitory
just
like
grass
that
was
kindled
it
all
ended
in
four
planks
and
a
to
be
had
from
miss
andersen
on
the
right
of
the
door
and
all
this
was
tossed
about
in
my
head
during
the
despairing
moment
when
my
landlady
was
about
to
thrust
me
from
her
door
he
does
hear
she
yelled
i
tell
you
you
quit
this
house
now
you
know
it
i
believe
god
blast
me
that
the
man
is
mad
i
do
now
out
you
go
on
the
blessed
spot
and
so
no
more
chat
about
it
i
looked
towards
the
door
not
in
order
to
leave
no
certainly
not
in
order
to
leave
an
audacious
notion
seized
me
if
there
had
been
a
key
in
the
door
i
would
have
turned
it
and
locked
myself
in
along
with
the
rest
to
escape
going
i
had
a
perfectly
hysterical
dread
of
going
out
into
the
streets
again
but
there
was
no
key
in
the
door
then
suddenly
my
landlord
voice
mingled
with
that
of
his
wife
and
i
stood
still
with
amazement
the
same
man
who
had
threatened
me
a
while
ago
took
my
part
strangely
enough
now
he
said
no
it
wo
do
to
turn
folk
out
at
night
do
you
know
one
can
be
punished
for
doing
that
i
did
know
if
there
was
a
punishment
for
that
i
could
say
but
perhaps
it
was
so
and
the
wife
bethought
herself
quickly
grew
quiet
and
spoke
no
more
she
placed
two
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
before
me
for
supper
but
i
did
not
touch
them
just
out
of
gratitude
to
the
man
so
i
pretended
that
i
had
had
a
little
food
in
town
when
at
length
i
took
myself
off
to
the
anteroom
to
go
to
bed
she
came
out
after
me
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
said
loudly
whilst
her
unsightly
figure
seemed
to
strut
out
towards
me
but
this
is
the
last
night
you
sleep
here
so
now
you
know
it
yes
yes
i
replied
there
would
perhaps
be
some
way
of
finding
a
shelter
tomorrow
if
i
tried
hard
for
it
i
would
surely
be
able
to
find
some
for
the
time
being
i
would
rejoice
that
i
was
not
obliged
to
go
out
tonight
i
slept
till
between
five
and
six
in
the
morning
it
was
not
yet
light
when
i
awoke
but
all
the
same
i
got
up
at
once
i
had
lain
in
all
my
clothes
on
account
of
the
cold
and
had
no
dressing
to
do
when
i
had
drunk
a
little
cold
water
and
opened
the
door
quietly
i
went
out
directly
for
i
was
afraid
to
face
my
landlady
again
a
couple
of
policemen
who
had
been
on
watch
all
night
were
the
only
living
beings
i
saw
in
the
street
a
while
after
some
men
began
to
extinguish
the
lamps
i
wandered
about
without
aim
or
end
reached
kirkegaden
and
the
road
down
towards
the
fortress
cold
and
still
sleepy
weak
in
the
knees
and
back
after
my
long
walk
and
very
hungry
i
sat
down
on
a
seat
and
dozed
for
a
long
time
for
three
weeks
i
had
lived
exclusively
on
the
bread
and
butter
that
my
landlady
had
given
me
morning
and
evening
now
it
was
hours
since
i
had
had
my
last
meal
hunger
began
to
gnaw
badly
at
me
again
i
must
seek
a
help
for
it
right
quickly
with
this
thought
i
fell
asleep
again
upon
the
seat
i
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
people
speaking
near
me
and
when
i
had
collected
myself
a
little
i
saw
that
it
was
broad
day
and
that
every
one
was
up
and
about
i
got
up
and
walked
away
the
sun
burst
over
the
heights
the
sky
was
pale
and
tender
and
in
my
delight
over
the
lovely
morning
after
the
many
dark
gloomy
weeks
i
forgot
all
cares
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
fared
worse
on
other
occasions
i
clapped
myself
on
the
chest
and
sang
a
little
snatch
for
myself
my
voice
sounded
so
wretched
downright
exhausted
it
sounded
and
i
moved
myself
to
tears
with
it
this
magnificent
day
the
white
heavens
swimming
in
light
had
far
too
mighty
an
effect
upon
me
and
i
burst
into
loud
weeping
what
is
the
matter
with
you
inquired
a
man
i
did
not
answer
but
hurried
away
hiding
my
face
from
all
men
i
reached
the
bridge
a
large
barque
with
the
russian
flag
lay
and
discharged
coal
i
read
her
name
on
her
side
it
distracted
me
for
a
time
to
watch
what
took
place
on
board
this
foreign
ship
she
must
be
almost
discharged
she
lay
with
ix
foot
visible
on
her
side
in
spite
of
all
the
ballast
she
had
already
taken
in
and
there
was
a
hollow
boom
through
the
whole
ship
whenever
the
stamped
on
the
deck
with
their
heavy
boots
the
sun
the
light
and
the
salt
breath
from
the
sea
all
this
busy
merry
life
pulled
me
together
a
bit
and
caused
my
blood
to
run
lustily
suddenly
it
entered
my
head
that
i
could
work
at
a
few
scenes
of
my
drama
whilst
i
sat
here
and
i
took
my
papers
out
of
my
pocket
i
tried
to
place
a
speech
into
a
monk
mouth
a
speech
that
ought
to
swell
with
pride
and
intolerance
but
it
was
of
no
use
so
i
skipped
over
the
monk
and
tried
to
work
out
an
oration
the
deemster
oration
to
the
violator
of
the
temple
and
i
wrote
of
this
oration
upon
which
i
stopped
the
right
local
colour
would
not
tinge
my
words
the
bustle
about
me
the
shanties
the
noise
of
the
gangways
and
the
ceaseless
rattle
of
the
iron
chains
fitted
in
so
little
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
musty
air
of
the
dim
middle
ages
that
was
to
envelop
my
drama
as
with
a
mist
i
bundled
my
papers
together
and
got
up
all
the
same
i
got
into
a
happy
vein
a
grand
vein
and
i
felt
convinced
that
i
could
effect
something
if
all
went
well
if
i
only
had
a
place
to
go
to
i
thought
over
it
stopped
right
there
in
the
street
and
pondered
but
i
could
not
bring
to
mind
a
single
quiet
spot
in
the
town
where
i
could
seat
myself
for
an
hour
there
was
no
other
way
open
i
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
in
vaterland
i
shrank
at
the
thought
of
it
and
i
told
myself
all
the
while
that
it
would
not
do
i
went
ahead
all
the
same
and
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
forbidden
spot
of
course
it
was
wretched
i
admitted
to
myself
that
it
was
degrading
downright
degrading
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
was
not
in
the
least
proud
i
dared
make
the
assertion
roundly
that
i
was
one
of
the
least
arrogant
beings
up
to
date
i
went
ahead
i
pulled
up
at
the
door
and
weighed
it
over
once
more
yes
no
matter
what
the
result
was
i
would
have
to
dare
it
after
all
said
and
done
what
a
bagatelle
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
for
the
first
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
hours
for
the
second
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
ever
seek
refuge
in
such
a
house
again
i
entered
the
yard
even
whilst
i
was
crossing
the
uneven
stones
i
was
irresolute
and
almost
turned
round
at
the
very
door
i
clenched
my
teeth
no
no
pride
at
the
worst
i
could
excuse
myself
by
saying
i
had
come
to
say
to
make
a
proper
adieu
and
come
to
a
clear
understanding
about
my
debt
to
the
house
i
took
forth
my
papers
once
more
and
determined
to
thrust
all
irrelevant
impressions
aside
i
had
left
off
right
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
in
the
inquisitor
address
thus
dictate
god
and
the
law
to
me
thus
dictates
also
the
counsel
of
my
wise
men
thus
dictate
i
and
my
own
conscience
i
looked
out
of
the
window
to
think
over
what
his
conscience
should
dictate
to
him
a
little
row
reached
me
from
the
room
inside
well
it
was
no
affair
of
mine
anyway
it
was
entirely
and
totally
indifferent
to
me
what
noise
arose
why
the
devil
should
i
sit
thinking
about
it
keep
quiet
now
thus
dictate
i
and
my
own
conscience
but
everything
conspired
against
me
outside
in
the
street
something
was
taking
place
that
disturbed
me
a
little
lad
sat
and
amused
himself
in
the
sun
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pavement
he
was
happy
and
in
fear
of
no
danger
just
sat
and
knotted
together
a
lot
of
paper
streamers
and
injuring
no
one
suddenly
he
jumps
up
and
begins
to
curse
he
goes
backwards
to
the
middle
of
the
street
and
catches
sight
of
a
man
a
man
with
a
red
beard
who
is
leaning
out
of
an
open
window
in
the
second
storey
and
who
spat
down
on
his
head
the
little
chap
cried
with
rage
and
swore
impatiently
up
at
the
window
and
the
man
laughed
in
his
face
perhaps
five
minutes
passed
in
this
way
i
turned
aside
to
avoid
seeing
the
little
tears
thus
dictate
i
and
my
own
conscience
i
found
it
impossible
to
get
any
farther
at
last
everything
began
to
get
confused
it
seemed
to
me
that
even
that
which
i
had
already
written
was
unfit
to
use
ay
that
the
whole
idea
was
contemptible
rubbish
how
could
one
possibly
talk
of
conscience
in
the
middle
ages
conscience
was
first
invented
by
shakespeare
consequently
my
whole
address
was
wrong
was
there
then
nothing
of
value
in
these
pages
i
ran
through
them
anew
and
solved
my
doubt
at
once
i
discovered
grand
pieces
downright
lengthy
pieces
of
remarkable
merit
and
once
again
the
intoxicating
desire
to
set
to
work
again
darted
through
my
breast
the
desire
to
finish
my
drama
i
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
without
paying
any
attention
to
my
landlord
furious
signs
to
go
out
quietly
i
walked
out
of
the
room
firmly
and
with
my
mind
made
up
i
went
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
and
entered
my
former
room
the
man
was
not
there
and
what
was
to
hinder
me
from
sitting
here
for
a
moment
i
would
not
touch
one
of
his
things
i
would
even
once
use
his
table
i
would
just
seat
myself
on
a
chair
near
the
door
and
be
happy
i
spread
the
papers
hurriedly
out
on
my
knees
things
went
splendidly
for
a
few
minutes
retort
upon
retort
stood
ready
in
my
head
and
i
wrote
uninterruptedly
i
filled
one
page
after
the
other
dashed
ahead
over
stock
and
stone
chuckled
softly
in
ecstasy
over
my
happy
vein
and
was
scarcely
conscious
of
myself
the
only
sound
i
heard
in
this
moment
was
my
own
merry
chuckle
a
singularly
happy
idea
had
just
struck
me
about
a
church
bell
a
church
bell
that
was
to
peal
out
at
a
certain
point
in
my
drama
all
was
going
ahead
with
overwhelming
rapidity
then
i
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
i
tremble
and
am
almost
beside
myself
sit
ready
to
bolt
timorous
watchful
full
of
fear
at
everything
and
excited
by
hunger
i
listen
nervously
just
hold
the
pencil
still
in
my
hand
and
listen
i
can
not
write
a
word
more
the
door
opens
and
the
pair
from
below
enter
even
before
i
had
time
to
make
an
excuse
for
what
i
had
done
the
landlady
calls
out
as
if
struck
of
a
heap
with
amazement
well
god
bless
and
save
us
if
he
is
sitting
here
again
excuse
me
i
said
and
i
would
have
added
more
but
got
no
farther
the
landlady
flung
open
the
door
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
shrieked
if
you
do
go
out
now
may
god
blast
me
but
i
fetch
the
police
i
got
up
i
only
wanted
to
say
to
you
i
murmured
and
i
had
to
wait
for
you
i
did
touch
anything
i
only
just
sat
here
on
the
chair
yes
yes
there
was
no
harm
in
that
said
the
man
what
the
devil
does
it
matter
let
the
man
alone
he
by
this
time
i
had
reached
the
end
of
the
stairs
all
at
once
i
got
furious
with
this
fat
swollen
woman
who
followed
close
to
my
heels
to
get
rid
of
me
quickly
and
i
stood
quiet
a
moment
with
the
worst
abusive
epithets
on
my
tongue
ready
to
sling
at
her
but
i
bethought
myself
in
time
and
held
my
peace
if
only
out
of
gratitude
to
the
stranger
man
who
followed
her
and
would
have
to
hear
them
she
trod
close
on
my
heels
railing
incessantly
and
my
anger
increased
with
every
step
i
took
we
reached
the
yard
below
i
walked
very
slowly
still
debating
whether
i
would
not
have
it
out
with
her
i
was
at
this
moment
completely
blinded
with
rage
and
i
searched
for
the
worst
word
an
expression
that
would
strike
her
dead
on
the
spot
like
a
kick
in
her
stomach
a
commissionaire
passes
me
at
the
entrance
he
touches
his
hat
i
take
no
notice
he
applies
to
her
and
i
hear
that
he
inquires
for
me
but
i
do
not
turn
round
a
couple
of
steps
outside
the
door
he
overtakes
and
stops
me
he
hands
me
an
envelope
i
tear
it
open
roughly
and
unwillingly
it
contains
no
note
not
a
word
i
look
at
the
man
and
ask
what
tomfoolery
is
this
who
is
the
letter
from
oh
that
i
ca
say
he
replies
but
it
was
a
lady
who
gave
it
to
me
i
stood
still
the
commissionaire
left
i
put
the
coin
into
the
envelope
again
crumple
it
up
coin
and
envelope
wheel
round
and
go
straight
towards
the
landlady
who
is
still
keeping
an
eye
on
me
from
the
doorway
and
throw
it
in
her
face
i
said
nothing
i
uttered
no
syllable
only
noticed
that
she
was
examining
the
crumpled
paper
as
i
left
her
ha
that
is
what
one
might
call
comporting
oneself
with
dignity
not
to
say
a
word
not
to
mention
the
contents
but
crumple
together
with
perfect
calmness
a
large
piece
of
money
and
fling
it
straight
in
the
face
of
persecutor
one
might
call
that
making
one
exit
with
dignity
that
was
the
way
to
treat
such
beasts
i
when
i
got
to
the
corner
of
tomtegaden
and
the
railway
place
the
street
commenced
suddenly
to
swim
around
before
my
eyes
it
buzzed
vacantly
in
my
head
and
i
staggered
up
against
the
wall
of
a
house
i
could
simply
go
no
farther
could
even
straighten
myself
from
the
cramped
position
i
was
in
as
i
fell
up
against
it
so
i
remained
standing
and
i
felt
that
i
was
beginning
to
lose
my
senses
my
insane
anger
had
augmented
this
attack
of
exhaustion
i
lifted
my
foot
and
stamped
on
the
pavement
i
also
tried
several
other
things
to
try
and
regain
my
strength
i
clenched
my
teeth
wrinkled
my
brows
and
rolled
my
eyes
despairingly
it
helped
a
little
my
thoughts
grew
more
lucid
it
was
clear
to
me
that
i
was
about
to
succumb
i
stretched
out
my
hands
and
pushed
myself
back
from
the
wall
the
street
still
danced
wildly
round
me
i
began
to
hiccough
with
rage
and
i
wrestled
from
my
very
inmost
soul
with
my
misery
made
a
right
gallant
effort
not
to
sink
down
it
was
not
my
intention
to
collapse
no
i
would
die
standing
a
dray
rolls
slowly
by
and
i
notice
there
are
potatoes
in
it
but
out
of
sheer
fury
and
stubbornness
i
take
it
into
my
head
to
assert
that
they
are
not
potatoes
but
cabbages
and
i
swore
frightful
oaths
that
they
were
cabbages
i
heard
quite
well
what
i
was
saying
and
i
swore
this
lie
wittingly
repeating
time
after
time
just
to
have
the
vicious
satisfaction
of
perjuring
myself
i
got
intoxicated
with
the
thought
of
this
matchless
sin
of
mine
i
raised
three
fingers
in
the
air
and
swore
with
trembling
lips
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
that
they
were
cabbages
time
went
i
let
myself
sink
down
on
the
steps
near
me
and
dried
the
sweat
from
my
brow
and
throat
drew
a
couple
of
long
breaths
and
forced
myself
into
calmness
the
sun
slid
down
it
declined
towards
the
afternoon
i
began
once
more
to
brood
over
my
condition
my
hunger
was
really
something
disgraceful
and
in
a
few
hours
more
night
would
be
here
again
the
question
was
to
think
of
a
remedy
while
there
was
yet
time
my
thoughts
flew
again
to
the
from
which
i
had
been
hunted
away
i
could
on
no
account
return
there
but
yet
one
could
not
help
thinking
about
it
properly
speaking
the
woman
was
acting
quite
within
her
rights
in
turning
me
out
how
could
i
expect
to
get
lodging
with
any
one
when
i
could
not
pay
for
it
besides
she
had
occasionally
given
me
a
little
food
even
yesterday
evening
after
i
had
annoyed
her
she
offered
me
some
bread
and
butter
she
offered
it
to
me
out
of
sheer
good
nature
because
she
knew
i
needed
it
so
i
had
no
cause
to
complain
i
began
even
whilst
i
sat
there
on
the
step
to
ask
her
pardon
in
my
own
mind
for
my
behaviour
particularly
i
regretted
bitterly
that
i
had
shown
myself
ungrateful
to
her
at
the
last
and
thrown
in
her
face
i
gave
a
whistle
the
letter
the
messenger
brought
me
where
did
it
come
from
it
was
only
this
instant
i
thought
clearly
over
this
and
i
divined
at
once
how
the
whole
thing
hung
together
i
grew
sick
with
pain
and
shame
i
whispered
ylajali
a
few
times
with
hoarse
voice
and
flung
back
my
head
was
it
not
i
who
no
later
than
yesterday
had
decided
to
pass
her
proudly
by
if
i
met
her
to
treat
her
with
the
greatest
indifference
instead
of
that
i
had
only
aroused
her
compassion
and
coaxed
an
alms
from
her
no
no
no
there
would
never
be
an
end
to
my
degradation
not
even
in
her
presence
could
i
maintain
a
decent
position
i
sank
simply
sank
on
all
sides
every
way
i
turned
sank
to
my
knees
sank
to
my
waist
dived
under
in
ignominy
never
to
rise
again
never
this
was
the
climax
to
accept
in
alms
without
being
able
to
fling
it
back
to
the
secret
donor
scramble
for
whenever
the
chance
offered
and
keep
them
use
them
for
lodging
money
in
spite
of
one
intense
inner
aversion
could
i
not
regain
the
in
some
way
or
another
to
go
back
to
the
landlady
and
try
to
get
it
from
her
would
be
of
no
use
there
must
be
some
way
if
i
were
to
consider
if
i
were
only
to
exert
myself
right
well
and
consider
it
over
it
was
not
in
this
case
great
god
sufficient
to
consider
in
just
an
ordinary
way
i
must
consider
so
that
it
penetrated
my
whole
sentient
being
consider
and
find
some
way
to
procure
this
and
i
set
to
to
consider
the
answer
to
this
problem
it
might
be
about
four
in
a
few
hours
time
i
could
perhaps
meet
the
manager
of
the
theatre
if
only
i
had
my
drama
completed
i
take
out
my
mss
there
where
i
am
sitting
and
resolve
with
might
and
main
to
finish
the
last
few
scenes
i
think
until
i
sweat
and
from
the
beginning
but
make
no
progress
no
bosh
i
say
no
obstinacy
now
and
i
write
away
at
my
drama
write
down
everything
that
strikes
me
just
to
get
finished
quickly
and
be
able
to
go
away
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
a
new
supreme
moment
had
seized
me
i
lied
right
royally
to
myself
deceived
myself
knowingly
and
wrote
on
as
if
i
had
no
need
to
seek
for
words
that
is
capital
that
is
really
a
find
whispered
i
interpolatingly
only
just
write
it
down
halt
they
sound
questionable
they
contrast
rather
strongly
with
the
speeches
in
the
first
scenes
not
a
trace
of
the
middle
ages
shone
through
the
monk
words
i
break
my
pencil
between
my
teeth
jump
to
my
feet
tear
my
manuscript
in
two
tear
each
page
in
two
fling
my
hat
down
in
the
street
and
trample
upon
it
i
am
lost
i
whisper
to
myself
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
lost
i
utter
no
more
than
these
few
words
as
long
as
i
stand
there
and
tramp
upon
my
hat
a
policeman
is
standing
a
few
steps
away
watching
me
he
is
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
he
only
pays
attention
to
me
as
i
lift
my
head
our
eyes
meet
maybe
he
has
been
standing
there
for
a
long
time
watching
me
i
pick
up
my
hat
put
it
on
and
go
over
to
him
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
i
ask
he
pauses
a
bit
as
he
hauls
out
his
watch
and
never
takes
his
eyes
off
me
the
whole
time
about
four
he
replies
accurately
i
say
about
four
perfectly
accurate
you
know
your
business
and
i
bear
you
in
mind
thereupon
i
left
him
he
looked
utterly
amazed
at
me
stood
and
looked
at
me
with
gaping
mouth
still
holding
his
watch
in
his
hand
when
i
got
in
front
of
the
royal
hotel
i
turned
and
looked
back
he
was
still
standing
in
the
same
position
following
me
with
his
eyes
ha
ha
that
is
the
way
to
treat
brutes
with
the
most
refined
effrontery
that
impresses
the
brutes
puts
the
fear
of
god
into
them
i
was
peculiarly
satisfied
with
myself
and
began
to
sing
a
little
strain
every
nerve
was
tense
with
excitement
without
feeling
any
more
pain
without
even
being
conscious
of
discomfort
of
any
kind
i
walked
light
as
a
feather
across
the
whole
market
turned
round
at
the
stalls
and
came
to
a
halt
sat
down
on
a
bench
near
our
church
might
it
not
just
as
well
be
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
i
returned
the
or
not
when
once
i
received
it
it
was
mine
and
there
was
evidently
no
want
where
it
came
from
besides
i
was
obliged
to
take
it
when
it
was
sent
expressly
to
me
there
could
be
no
object
in
letting
the
messenger
keep
it
it
would
do
either
to
send
it
back
a
whole
that
had
been
sent
to
me
so
there
was
positively
no
help
for
it
i
tried
to
watch
the
bustle
about
me
in
the
market
and
distract
myself
with
indifferent
things
but
i
did
not
succeed
the
still
busied
my
thoughts
at
last
i
clenched
my
fists
and
got
angry
it
would
hurt
her
if
i
were
to
send
it
back
why
then
should
i
do
so
always
ready
to
consider
myself
too
good
for
everything
to
toss
my
head
and
say
no
thanks
i
saw
now
what
it
led
to
i
was
out
in
the
street
again
even
when
i
had
the
opportunity
i
could
keep
my
good
warm
lodging
no
i
must
needs
be
proud
jump
up
at
the
first
word
and
show
i
was
the
man
to
stand
trifling
chuck
right
and
left
and
go
my
way
i
took
myself
sharply
to
task
for
having
left
my
lodging
and
brought
myself
into
the
most
distressful
circumstances
as
for
the
rest
i
consigned
the
whole
affair
to
the
keeping
of
the
yellowest
of
devils
i
had
begged
for
the
and
i
had
barely
had
it
in
my
hand
but
gave
it
away
at
once
paid
it
away
to
utterly
strange
people
whom
i
would
never
see
again
that
was
the
sort
of
man
i
was
i
always
paid
out
to
the
last
doit
whatever
i
owed
if
i
knew
ylajali
aright
neither
did
she
regret
that
she
had
sent
me
the
money
therefore
why
did
i
sit
there
working
myself
into
a
rage
to
put
it
plainly
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
send
me
now
and
then
the
poor
girl
was
indeed
in
love
with
me
ha
perhaps
even
fatally
in
love
with
me
and
i
sat
and
puffed
myself
up
with
this
notion
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
was
in
love
with
me
the
poor
girl
it
struck
five
again
i
sank
under
the
weight
of
my
prolonged
nervous
excitement
the
hollow
whirring
in
my
head
made
itself
felt
anew
i
stared
straight
ahead
kept
my
eyes
fixed
and
gazed
at
the
chemist
under
the
sign
of
the
elephant
hunger
was
waging
a
fierce
battle
in
me
at
this
moment
and
i
was
suffering
greatly
whilst
i
sit
thus
and
look
out
into
space
a
figure
becomes
little
by
little
clear
to
my
fixed
stare
at
last
i
can
distinguish
it
perfectly
plainly
and
i
recognize
it
it
is
that
of
the
who
sits
habitually
near
the
chemist
under
the
sign
of
the
elephant
i
give
a
start
sit
on
the
seat
and
begin
to
consider
yes
it
was
quite
correct
the
same
woman
before
the
same
table
on
the
same
spot
i
whistle
a
few
times
and
snap
my
fingers
rise
from
my
seat
and
make
for
the
chemist
no
nonsense
at
all
what
the
devil
was
it
to
me
if
it
was
the
wages
of
sin
or
norwegian
huckster
pieces
of
silver
from
kongsberg
i
was
going
to
be
abused
one
might
die
of
too
much
pride
i
go
on
to
the
corner
take
stock
of
the
woman
and
come
to
a
standstill
before
her
i
smile
nod
as
to
an
acquaintance
and
shape
my
words
as
if
it
were
a
foregone
conclusion
that
i
would
return
sometime
say
i
perhaps
you
do
recognize
me
again
no
she
replied
slowly
and
looks
at
me
i
smile
still
more
as
if
this
were
only
an
excellent
joke
of
hers
this
pretending
not
to
know
me
again
and
say
do
you
recollect
that
i
gave
you
a
lot
of
silver
once
i
did
not
say
anything
on
the
occasion
in
question
as
far
as
i
can
call
to
mind
i
did
not
it
is
not
my
way
to
do
so
when
one
has
honest
folk
to
deal
with
it
is
unnecessary
to
make
an
agreement
so
to
say
draw
up
a
contract
for
every
trifle
ha
ha
yes
it
was
i
who
gave
you
the
money
no
then
now
was
it
you
yes
i
remember
you
now
that
i
come
to
think
over
it
i
wanted
to
prevent
her
from
thanking
me
for
the
money
so
i
say
therefore
hastily
whilst
i
cast
my
eye
over
the
table
in
search
of
something
to
eat
yes
i
come
now
to
get
the
cakes
she
did
not
seem
to
take
this
in
the
cakes
i
reiterate
i
come
now
to
get
them
at
any
rate
the
first
instalment
i
do
need
all
of
them
today
you
come
to
get
them
yes
of
course
i
come
to
get
them
i
reply
and
i
laugh
boisterously
as
if
it
ought
to
have
been
to
her
from
the
outset
that
i
came
for
that
purpose
i
take
too
a
cake
up
from
the
table
a
sort
of
white
roll
that
i
commenced
to
eat
when
the
woman
sees
this
she
stirs
uneasily
inside
her
bundle
of
clothes
makes
an
involuntary
movement
as
if
to
protect
her
wares
and
gives
me
to
understand
that
she
had
not
expected
me
to
return
to
rob
her
of
them
really
not
i
say
indeed
really
not
she
certainly
was
an
extraordinary
woman
had
she
then
at
any
time
had
the
experience
that
some
one
came
and
gave
her
a
heap
of
shillings
to
take
care
of
without
that
person
returning
and
demanding
them
again
no
just
look
at
that
now
did
she
perhaps
run
away
with
the
idea
that
it
was
stolen
money
since
i
slung
it
at
her
in
that
manner
no
she
did
think
that
either
well
that
at
least
was
a
good
thing
really
a
good
thing
it
was
if
i
might
so
say
kind
of
her
in
spite
of
all
to
consider
me
an
honest
man
ha
ha
yes
indeed
she
really
was
good
but
why
did
i
give
her
the
money
then
the
woman
was
exasperated
and
called
out
loudly
about
it
i
explained
why
i
had
given
her
the
money
explained
it
temperately
and
with
emphasis
it
was
my
custom
to
act
in
this
manner
because
i
had
such
a
belief
in
every
one
goodness
always
when
any
one
offered
me
an
agreement
a
receipt
i
only
shook
my
head
and
said
no
thank
you
god
knows
i
did
but
still
the
woman
failed
to
comprehend
it
i
had
recourse
to
other
expedients
spoke
sharply
and
bade
a
truce
to
all
nonsense
had
it
never
happened
to
her
before
that
any
one
had
paid
her
in
advance
in
this
manner
i
inquired
i
meant
of
course
people
who
could
afford
it
for
example
any
of
the
consuls
never
well
i
could
not
be
expected
to
suffer
because
it
happened
to
be
a
strange
mode
of
procedure
to
her
it
was
a
common
practice
abroad
she
had
perhaps
never
been
outside
the
boundaries
of
her
own
country
no
just
look
at
that
now
in
that
case
she
could
of
course
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
and
i
took
several
more
cakes
from
the
table
she
grumbled
angrily
refused
obstinately
to
give
up
any
more
of
her
stores
from
off
the
table
even
snatched
a
piece
of
cake
out
of
my
hand
and
put
it
back
into
its
place
i
got
enraged
banked
the
table
and
threatened
to
call
the
police
i
wished
to
be
lenient
with
her
i
said
were
i
to
take
all
that
was
lawfully
mine
i
would
clear
her
whole
stand
because
it
was
a
big
sum
of
money
that
i
had
given
to
her
but
i
had
no
intention
of
taking
so
much
i
wanted
in
reality
only
half
the
value
of
the
money
and
i
would
into
the
bargain
never
come
back
to
trouble
her
again
might
god
preserve
me
from
it
seeing
that
that
was
the
sort
of
creature
she
was
at
length
she
shoved
some
cakes
towards
me
four
or
five
at
an
exorbitant
price
the
highest
possible
price
she
could
think
of
and
bade
me
take
them
and
begone
i
wrangled
still
with
her
persisted
that
she
had
at
least
cheated
me
to
the
extent
of
a
shilling
besides
robbing
me
with
her
exorbitant
prices
do
you
know
there
is
a
penalty
for
such
rascally
trickery
said
i
god
help
you
you
might
get
penal
servitude
for
life
you
old
fool
she
flung
another
cake
to
me
and
with
almost
gnashing
teeth
begged
me
to
go
and
i
left
her
ha
a
match
for
this
dishonest
was
not
to
be
found
the
whole
time
whilst
i
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
and
ate
my
cakes
i
talked
loudly
about
this
creature
and
her
shamelessness
repeated
to
myself
what
we
both
had
said
to
one
another
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
come
out
of
this
affair
with
flying
colours
leaving
her
nowhere
i
ate
my
cakes
in
face
of
everybody
and
talked
this
over
to
myself
the
cakes
disappeared
one
by
one
they
seemed
to
go
no
way
no
matter
how
i
ate
i
was
still
greedily
hungry
lord
to
think
they
were
of
no
help
i
was
so
ravenous
that
i
was
even
about
to
devour
the
last
little
cake
that
i
had
decided
to
spare
right
from
the
beginning
to
put
it
aside
in
fact
for
the
little
chap
down
in
vognmandsgade
the
little
lad
who
played
with
the
paper
streamers
i
thought
of
him
continually
could
forget
his
face
as
he
jumped
and
swore
he
had
turned
round
towards
the
window
when
the
man
spat
down
on
him
and
he
had
just
looked
up
to
see
if
i
was
laughing
at
him
god
knows
if
i
should
meet
him
now
even
if
i
went
down
that
way
i
exerted
myself
greatly
to
try
and
reach
vognmandsgade
passed
quickly
by
the
spot
where
i
had
torn
my
drama
into
tatters
and
where
some
scraps
of
papers
still
lay
about
avoided
the
policeman
whom
i
had
amazed
by
my
behaviour
and
reached
the
steps
upon
which
the
laddie
had
been
sitting
he
was
not
there
the
street
was
almost
deserted
dusk
was
gathering
in
and
i
could
not
see
him
anywhere
perhaps
he
had
gone
in
i
laid
the
cake
down
stood
it
upright
against
the
door
knocked
hard
and
hurried
away
directly
he
is
sure
to
find
it
i
said
to
myself
the
first
thing
he
will
do
when
he
comes
out
will
be
to
find
it
and
my
eyes
grew
moist
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
the
little
chap
finding
the
cake
i
reached
the
terminus
again
now
i
no
longer
felt
hungry
only
the
sweet
stuff
i
had
eaten
began
to
cause
me
discomfort
the
wildest
thoughts
too
surged
up
anew
in
my
head
supposing
i
were
in
all
secretness
to
cut
the
hawser
mooring
one
of
those
ships
supposing
i
were
to
suddenly
yell
out
fire
i
walk
farther
down
the
wharf
find
a
and
sit
upon
it
fold
my
hands
and
am
conscious
that
my
head
is
growing
more
and
more
confused
i
do
not
stir
i
simply
make
no
effort
whatever
to
keep
up
any
longer
i
just
sit
there
and
stare
at
the
the
barque
flying
the
russian
flag
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
man
at
the
rail
the
red
lantern
slung
at
the
port
shines
down
upon
his
head
and
i
get
up
and
talk
over
to
him
i
had
no
object
in
talking
as
i
did
not
expect
to
get
a
reply
either
i
said
do
you
sail
tonight
captain
yes
in
a
short
time
answered
the
man
he
spoke
swedish
hem
i
suppose
you
would
happen
to
need
a
man
i
was
at
this
instant
utterly
indifferent
as
to
whether
i
was
met
by
a
refusal
or
not
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
what
reply
the
man
gave
me
so
i
stood
and
waited
for
it
well
no
he
replied
unless
it
chanced
to
be
a
young
fellow
a
young
fellow
i
pulled
myself
together
took
off
my
glasses
furtively
and
thrust
them
into
my
pocket
stepped
up
the
gangway
and
strode
on
deck
i
have
no
experience
said
i
but
i
can
do
anything
i
am
put
to
where
are
you
bound
for
we
are
in
ballast
for
leith
to
fetch
coal
for
cadiz
all
right
said
i
forcing
myself
upon
the
man
it
all
the
same
to
me
where
i
go
i
am
prepared
to
do
my
work
have
you
never
sailed
before
he
asked
no
but
as
i
tell
you
put
me
to
a
task
and
i
do
it
i
am
used
to
a
little
of
all
sorts
he
bethought
himself
again
i
had
already
taken
keenly
into
my
head
that
i
was
to
sail
this
voyage
and
i
began
to
dread
being
hounded
on
shore
again
what
do
you
think
about
it
captain
i
asked
at
last
i
can
really
do
anything
that
turns
up
what
am
i
saying
i
would
be
a
poor
sort
of
chap
if
i
could
do
a
little
more
than
just
what
i
was
put
to
i
can
take
two
watches
at
a
stretch
if
it
comes
to
that
it
would
only
do
me
good
and
i
could
hold
out
all
the
same
all
right
have
a
try
at
it
if
it
does
work
well
we
can
part
in
england
of
course
i
reply
in
my
delight
and
i
repeated
over
again
that
we
could
part
in
england
if
it
did
work
and
he
set
me
to
work
out
in
the
fjord
i
dragged
myself
up
once
wet
with
fever
and
exhaustion
and
gazed
landwards
and
bade
farewell
for
the
present
to
the
town
to
christiania
where
the
windows
gleamed
so
brightly
in
all
the
homes
