ziska
the
problem
of
a
wicked
soul
prologue
dark
against
the
sky
towered
the
great
pyramid
and
over
its
apex
hung
the
moon
like
a
wreck
cast
ashore
by
some
titanic
storm
the
sphinx
reposing
amid
the
undulating
waves
of
grayish
sand
surrounding
it
seemed
for
once
to
drowse
its
solemn
visage
that
had
impassively
watched
ages
come
and
go
empires
rise
and
fall
and
generations
of
men
live
and
die
appeared
for
the
moment
to
have
lost
its
usual
expression
of
speculative
wisdom
and
intense
disdain
its
cold
eyes
seemed
to
droop
its
stern
mouth
almost
smiled
the
air
was
calm
and
sultry
and
not
a
human
foot
disturbed
the
silence
but
towards
midnight
a
voice
suddenly
arose
as
it
were
like
a
wind
in
the
desert
crying
aloud
araxes
araxes
and
wailing
past
sank
with
a
profound
echo
into
the
deep
recesses
of
the
vast
egyptian
tomb
moonlight
and
the
hour
wove
their
own
mystery
the
mystery
of
a
shadow
and
a
shape
that
flitted
out
like
a
thin
vapor
from
the
very
portals
of
death
ancient
temple
and
drifting
forward
a
few
paces
resolved
itself
into
the
visionary
fairness
of
a
woman
form
a
woman
whose
dark
hair
fell
about
her
heavily
like
the
black
remnants
of
a
corpse
wrappings
a
woman
whose
eyes
flashed
with
an
unholy
fire
as
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
white
moon
and
waved
her
ghostly
arms
upon
the
air
and
again
the
wild
voice
pulsated
through
the
stillness
araxes
araxes
thou
art
here
and
i
pursue
thee
through
life
into
death
through
death
out
into
life
again
i
find
thee
and
i
follow
i
follow
araxes
moonlight
and
the
hour
wove
their
own
mystery
and
ere
the
pale
opal
dawn
flushed
the
sky
with
hues
of
rose
and
amber
the
shadow
had
vanished
the
voice
was
heard
no
more
slowly
the
sun
lifted
the
edge
of
its
golden
shield
above
the
horizon
and
the
great
sphinx
awaking
from
its
apparent
brief
slumber
stared
in
expressive
and
eternal
scorn
across
the
tracts
of
sand
and
tufted
towards
the
glittering
dome
of
that
abode
of
profound
sanctity
and
learning
where
men
still
knelt
and
worshipped
praying
the
unknown
to
deliver
them
from
the
unseen
and
one
would
almost
have
deemed
that
the
sculptured
monster
with
the
enigmatical
and
had
strange
thoughts
in
its
huge
granite
brain
for
when
the
full
day
sprang
in
glory
over
the
desert
and
illumined
its
large
features
with
a
burning
saffron
radiance
its
cruel
lips
still
smiled
as
though
yearning
to
speak
and
propound
the
terrible
riddle
of
old
time
the
problem
which
killed
chapter
i
it
was
the
full
season
in
cairo
the
ubiquitous
britisher
and
the
no
less
ubiquitous
american
had
planted
their
differing
society
standards
on
the
sandy
soil
watered
by
the
nile
and
were
busily
engaged
in
the
work
of
reducing
the
city
formerly
called
al
kahira
or
the
victorious
to
a
more
deplorable
condition
of
subjection
and
slavery
than
any
conqueror
could
ever
have
done
for
the
heavy
yoke
of
modern
fashion
has
been
flung
on
the
neck
of
al
kahira
and
the
irresistible
tyrannic
dominion
of
swagger
vulgarity
has
laid
the
victorious
low
the
swarthy
children
of
the
desert
might
and
possibly
would
be
ready
and
willing
to
go
forth
and
fight
men
with
men
weapons
for
the
freedom
to
live
and
die
unmolested
in
their
own
native
land
but
against
the
perspiring
horde
of
cook
cheap
trippers
what
can
they
do
save
remain
inert
and
speechless
for
nothing
like
the
cheap
tripper
was
ever
seen
in
the
world
till
our
present
enlightened
and
glorious
day
of
progress
he
is
a
type
of
nomad
like
and
yet
unlike
a
man
the
darwin
theory
asserts
itself
proudly
and
prominently
in
bristles
of
truth
all
over
him
in
his
restlessness
his
agility
and
curiosity
his
shameless
inquisitiveness
his
careful
cleansing
of
himself
from
foreign
fleas
his
general
attention
to
minutiae
and
his
always
voracious
appetite
and
where
the
ape
ends
and
the
man
begins
is
somewhat
difficult
to
discover
the
image
of
god
wherewith
he
together
with
his
fellows
was
originally
supposed
to
be
impressed
in
the
first
fresh
days
of
creation
seems
fairly
blotted
out
for
there
is
no
touch
of
the
divine
in
his
mortal
composition
nor
does
the
second
created
copy
of
the
divineo
namely
the
heroic
dignify
his
form
or
ennoble
his
countenance
there
is
nothing
of
the
heroic
in
the
wandering
biped
who
swings
through
the
streets
of
cairo
in
white
flannels
laughing
at
the
staid
composure
of
the
arabs
flicking
thumb
and
finger
at
the
patient
noses
of
the
small
hireable
donkeys
and
other
beasts
of
burden
thrusting
a
warm
red
face
of
inquiry
into
the
shadowy
recesses
of
odoriferous
bazaars
and
sauntering
at
evening
in
the
esbekiyeh
gardens
cigar
in
mouth
and
hands
in
pockets
looking
on
the
scene
and
behaving
in
it
as
if
the
whole
place
were
but
a
reflex
of
earl
court
exhibition
history
affects
the
cheap
tripper
not
at
all
he
regards
the
pyramids
as
good
building
merely
and
the
inscrutable
sphinx
itself
as
a
fine
target
for
empty
bottles
while
perhaps
his
chiefest
regret
is
that
the
granite
whereof
the
ancient
monster
is
hewn
is
too
hard
for
him
to
inscribe
his
distinguished
name
thereon
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
punishment
inflicted
on
any
person
or
persons
attempting
such
wanton
work
a
fine
or
the
bastinado
yet
neither
fine
nor
bastinado
would
affect
the
tripper
if
he
could
only
succeed
in
carving
on
the
sphinx
jaw
but
he
can
not
and
herein
is
his
own
misery
otherwise
he
comports
himself
in
egypt
as
he
does
at
margate
with
no
more
thought
reflection
or
reverence
than
dignify
the
composition
of
his
simian
ancestor
taking
him
all
in
all
he
is
however
no
worse
and
in
some
respects
better
than
the
swagger
folk
who
do
egypt
or
rather
consent
in
a
languid
way
to
be
done
by
egypt
these
are
the
people
who
annually
leave
england
on
the
plea
of
being
unable
to
stand
the
cheery
frosty
and
in
every
respect
healthy
winter
of
their
native
country
that
winter
which
with
its
wild
winds
its
sparkling
frost
and
snow
its
holly
trees
bright
with
scarlet
berries
its
merry
hunters
galloping
over
field
and
moor
during
daylight
hours
and
its
great
log
fires
roaring
up
the
chimneys
at
evening
was
sufficiently
good
for
their
forefathers
to
thrive
upon
and
live
through
contentedly
up
to
a
hale
and
hearty
old
age
in
the
times
when
the
fever
of
travelling
from
place
to
place
was
an
unknown
disease
and
home
was
indeed
sweet
home
infected
by
strange
maladies
of
the
blood
and
nerves
to
which
even
scientific
physicians
find
it
hard
to
give
suitable
names
they
shudder
at
the
first
whiff
of
cold
and
filling
huge
trunks
with
a
thousand
foolish
things
which
have
through
luxurious
habit
become
necessities
to
their
pallid
existences
they
hastily
depart
to
the
land
of
the
sun
carrying
with
them
their
nameless
languors
discontents
and
incurable
illnesses
for
which
heaven
itself
much
less
egypt
could
provide
no
remedy
it
is
not
at
all
to
be
wondered
at
that
these
physically
and
morally
sick
tribes
of
human
kind
have
ceased
to
give
any
serious
attention
as
to
what
may
possibly
become
of
them
after
death
or
whether
there
is
any
after
for
they
are
in
the
mentally
comatose
condition
which
precedes
entire
wreckage
of
existence
itself
has
become
a
bore
one
place
is
like
another
and
they
repeat
the
same
monotonous
round
of
living
in
every
spot
where
they
congregate
whether
it
be
east
west
north
or
south
on
the
riviera
they
find
little
to
do
except
meet
at
rumpelmayer
at
cannes
the
london
house
at
nice
or
the
casino
at
and
in
cairo
they
inaugurate
a
miniature
london
season
over
again
worked
in
the
same
groove
of
dinners
dances
drives
picnics
flirtations
and
matrimonial
engagements
but
the
cairene
season
has
perhaps
some
advantage
over
the
london
one
so
far
as
this
particular
set
of
swagger
folk
are
concerned
it
is
less
hampered
by
the
proprieties
one
can
be
more
free
you
know
you
may
take
a
little
walk
into
old
cairo
and
turning
a
corner
you
may
catch
glimpses
of
what
mark
twain
calls
oriental
simplicity
namely
groups
of
dear
delightful
arabs
whose
clothing
is
no
more
than
primitive
custom
makes
strictly
necessary
these
kind
of
tableaux
vivants
or
art
studies
give
quite
a
thrill
of
novelty
to
society
a
touch
of
savagery
a
soupcon
of
peculiarity
which
is
entirely
lacking
to
fashionable
london
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
children
of
the
desert
have
been
led
by
gentle
degrees
to
understand
that
for
harboring
the
strange
locusts
imported
into
their
land
by
cook
and
the
still
stranger
specimens
of
unclassified
insect
called
upper
ten
which
imports
itself
they
will
receive
backsheesh
backsheesh
is
a
certain
source
of
comfort
to
all
nations
and
translates
itself
with
sweetest
euphony
into
all
languages
and
the
tribes
have
justice
on
their
side
when
they
demand
as
much
of
it
as
they
can
get
rightfully
or
wrongfully
they
deserve
to
gain
some
sort
of
advantage
out
of
the
swarms
of
western
invaders
who
amaze
them
by
their
dress
and
affront
them
by
their
manners
backsheesh
therefore
has
become
the
perpetual
cry
of
the
it
is
the
only
means
of
offence
and
defence
left
to
them
and
very
naturally
they
cling
to
it
with
fervor
and
resolution
and
who
shall
blame
them
the
tall
majestic
meditative
arab
superb
as
mere
man
and
standing
on
his
sandy
native
soil
with
his
one
rough
garment
flung
round
his
loins
and
his
great
black
eyes
fronting
the
sun
merits
something
considerable
for
condescending
to
act
as
guide
and
servant
to
the
western
moneyed
civilian
who
clothes
his
lower
limbs
in
straight
cloth
casings
shaped
to
the
strict
resemblance
of
an
elephant
legs
and
finishes
the
graceful
design
by
enclosing
the
rest
of
his
body
in
a
stiff
shirt
wherein
he
can
scarcely
move
and
a
coat
which
divides
him
neatly
in
twain
by
a
line
immediately
above
the
knee
with
the
effect
of
lessening
his
height
by
several
inches
the
surveys
him
gravely
and
in
civil
compassion
sometimes
with
a
muttered
prayer
against
the
hideousness
of
him
but
on
the
whole
with
patience
and
equanimity
influenced
by
considerations
of
backsheesh
and
the
english
season
whirls
lightly
and
vaporously
like
blown
over
the
mystic
land
of
the
old
gods
the
terrible
land
filled
with
dark
secrets
as
yet
unexplored
the
land
shadowing
with
wings
as
the
bible
hath
it
the
land
in
which
are
buried
tremendous
histories
as
yet
unguessed
profound
enigmas
of
the
supernatural
labyrinths
of
wonder
terror
and
mystery
all
of
which
remain
unrevealed
to
the
dancing
dining
gabbling
throng
of
the
fashionable
travelling
lunatics
of
the
day
the
people
who
never
think
because
it
is
too
much
trouble
people
whose
one
idea
is
to
journey
from
hotel
to
hotel
and
compare
notes
with
their
acquaintances
afterwards
as
to
which
house
provided
them
with
the
food
for
it
is
a
noticeable
fact
that
with
most
visitors
to
the
show
places
of
europe
and
the
east
food
bedding
and
selfish
personal
comfort
are
the
first
considerations
the
scenery
and
the
associations
come
last
formerly
the
position
was
reversed
in
the
days
when
there
were
no
railways
and
the
immortal
byron
wrote
his
childe
harold
it
was
customary
to
rate
personal
inconvenience
lightly
the
beautiful
or
historic
scene
was
the
attraction
for
the
traveller
and
not
the
arrangements
made
for
his
special
form
of
digestive
apparatus
byron
could
sleep
on
the
deck
of
a
sailing
vessel
wrapped
in
his
cloak
and
feel
none
the
worse
for
it
his
mind
and
aspiring
spirit
soared
above
all
bodily
discomforts
his
thoughts
were
engrossed
with
the
mighty
teachings
of
time
he
was
able
to
lose
himself
in
glorious
reveries
on
the
lessons
of
the
past
and
the
possibilities
of
the
future
the
attitude
of
the
inspired
thinker
as
well
as
poet
was
his
and
a
crust
of
bread
and
cheese
served
him
as
sufficiently
on
his
journeyings
among
the
then
unspoilt
valleys
and
mountains
of
switzerland
as
the
warm
greasy
indigestible
fare
of
the
elaborate
at
lucerne
and
interlaken
serve
us
now
but
we
in
our
superior
condition
the
byronic
spirit
of
indifference
to
events
and
scorn
of
trifles
we
say
it
is
melodramatic
completely
forgetting
that
our
attitude
towards
ourselves
and
things
in
general
is
one
of
most
pitiable
bathos
we
can
not
write
childe
harold
but
we
can
grumble
at
both
bed
and
board
in
every
hotel
under
the
sun
we
can
discover
teasing
midges
in
the
air
and
questionable
insects
in
the
rooms
and
we
can
discuss
each
bill
presented
to
us
with
an
industrious
persistence
which
nearly
drives
landlords
frantic
and
ourselves
as
well
in
these
kind
of
important
matters
we
are
indeed
superior
to
byron
and
other
ranting
dreamers
of
his
type
but
we
produce
no
childe
harolds
and
we
have
come
to
the
strange
pass
of
pretending
that
don
juan
is
improper
while
we
pore
over
zola
with
avidity
to
such
a
pitch
has
our
culture
brought
us
and
like
the
pharisee
in
the
testament
we
thank
god
we
are
not
as
others
are
we
are
glad
we
are
not
as
the
arab
as
the
african
as
the
hindoo
we
are
proud
of
our
and
our
dividing
these
things
show
we
are
civilized
and
that
god
approves
of
us
more
than
any
other
type
of
creature
ever
created
we
take
possession
of
nations
not
by
thunder
of
war
but
by
clatter
of
we
do
not
raise
armies
we
build
hotels
and
we
settle
ourselves
in
egypt
as
we
do
at
homburg
to
dress
and
dine
and
sleep
and
sniff
contempt
on
all
things
but
ourselves
to
such
an
extent
that
we
have
actually
got
into
the
habit
of
calling
the
natives
of
the
places
we
usurp
foreigners
we
are
the
foreigners
but
somehow
we
never
can
see
it
wherever
we
condescend
to
build
hotels
that
spot
we
consider
ours
we
are
surprised
at
the
impertinence
of
frankfort
people
who
presume
to
visit
homburg
while
we
are
having
our
season
there
we
wonder
how
they
dare
do
it
and
of
a
truth
they
seem
amazed
at
their
own
boldness
and
creep
shyly
through
the
as
though
fearing
to
be
turned
out
by
the
custodians
the
same
thing
occurs
in
egypt
we
are
frequently
astounded
at
what
we
call
the
impertinence
of
these
foreigners
the
natives
they
ought
to
be
proud
to
have
us
and
our
glad
to
see
such
noble
and
beautiful
types
of
civilization
as
the
stout
parvenu
with
his
pendant
paunch
and
his
family
of
gawky
youths
and
maidens
of
the
genus
glad
to
see
the
english
mamma
who
never
grows
old
but
wears
young
hair
in
innocent
curls
and
has
her
wrinkles
annually
massaged
out
by
a
paris
artiste
in
complexion
the
we
say
should
be
happy
and
grateful
to
see
such
sights
and
not
demand
so
much
backsheesh
in
fact
the
should
not
get
so
much
in
our
way
as
he
does
he
is
a
very
good
servant
of
course
but
as
a
man
and
a
brother
pooh
egypt
may
be
his
country
and
he
may
love
it
as
much
as
we
love
england
but
our
feelings
are
more
to
be
considered
than
his
and
there
is
no
connecting
link
of
human
sympathy
between
and
nudity
so
at
least
thought
sir
chetwynd
lyle
a
stout
gentleman
of
coarse
build
and
coarser
physiognomy
as
he
sat
in
a
deep
in
the
great
hall
or
lounge
of
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
smoking
after
dinner
in
the
company
of
two
or
three
acquaintances
with
whom
he
had
fraternized
during
his
stay
in
cairo
sir
chetwynd
was
fond
of
airing
his
opinions
for
the
benefit
of
as
many
people
who
cared
to
listen
to
him
and
sir
chetwynd
had
some
right
to
his
opinions
inasmuch
as
he
was
the
editor
and
proprietor
of
a
large
london
newspaper
his
knighthood
was
quite
a
recent
distinction
and
nobody
knew
exactly
how
he
had
managed
to
get
it
he
had
originally
been
known
in
fleet
street
by
the
irreverent
sobriquet
of
greasy
chetwynd
owing
to
his
largeness
oiliness
and
general
air
of
benevolence
he
had
a
wife
and
two
daughters
and
one
of
his
objects
in
wintering
at
cairo
was
to
get
his
cherished
children
married
it
was
time
for
the
bloom
was
slightly
off
the
fair
the
dainty
petals
of
the
delicate
buds
were
beginning
to
wither
and
sir
chetwynd
had
heard
much
of
cairo
he
understood
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
liberty
allowed
there
between
men
and
maids
that
they
went
out
together
on
driving
excursions
to
the
pyramids
that
they
rode
on
lilliputian
donkeys
over
the
sand
at
moonlight
that
they
floated
about
in
boats
at
evening
on
the
nile
and
that
in
short
there
were
more
opportunities
of
marriage
among
the
of
egypt
than
in
all
the
rush
and
crush
of
london
so
here
he
was
portly
and
comfortable
and
on
the
whole
well
satisfied
with
his
expedition
there
were
a
good
many
eligible
bachelors
about
and
muriel
and
dolly
were
really
doing
their
best
so
was
their
mother
lady
chetwynd
lyle
she
allowed
no
eligible
to
escape
her
observation
and
on
this
particular
evening
she
was
in
all
her
glory
for
there
was
to
be
a
costume
ball
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
a
superb
affair
organized
by
the
proprietors
for
the
amusement
of
their
paying
guests
who
certainly
paid
well
even
stiffly
owing
to
the
preparations
that
were
going
on
for
this
festivity
the
lounge
with
its
sumptuous
egyptian
decorations
and
luxurious
modern
fittings
was
deserted
save
for
sir
chetwynd
and
his
particular
group
of
friends
to
whom
he
was
holding
forth
between
slow
on
the
squalor
of
the
arabs
the
frightful
thievery
of
the
sheiks
the
incompetency
of
his
own
special
dragoman
and
the
mistake
people
made
in
thinking
the
egyptians
themselves
a
fine
race
they
are
tall
certainly
said
sir
chetwynd
surveying
his
paunch
which
lolled
comfortably
and
as
it
were
by
itself
in
front
of
him
like
a
kind
of
waistcoated
i
grant
you
they
are
tall
that
is
the
majority
of
them
are
but
i
have
seen
short
men
among
them
the
khedive
is
not
taller
than
i
am
and
the
egyptian
face
is
very
deceptive
the
features
are
often
fine
occasionally
classic
but
intelligent
expression
is
totally
lacking
here
sir
chetwynd
waved
his
cigar
descriptively
as
though
he
would
fain
suggest
that
a
heavy
jaw
a
fat
nose
with
a
pimple
at
the
end
and
a
gross
mouth
with
black
teeth
inside
it
which
were
special
points
in
his
own
physiognomy
went
further
to
make
up
intelligent
expression
than
any
straight
eastern
type
of
countenance
ever
seen
or
imagined
well
i
do
quite
agree
with
you
there
said
a
man
who
was
lying
full
length
on
one
of
the
divans
close
by
and
smoking
these
brown
chaps
have
deuced
fine
eyes
there
does
seem
to
be
any
lack
of
expression
in
them
and
that
reminds
me
there
is
at
fellow
arrived
here
who
looks
for
all
the
world
like
an
egyptian
of
the
best
form
he
is
a
frenchman
though
a
provencal
every
one
knows
him
he
is
the
famous
painter
armand
gervase
indeed
and
sir
chetwynd
roused
himself
at
the
name
armand
gervase
the
armand
gervase
the
only
one
original
laughed
the
other
he
come
here
to
make
studies
of
eastern
women
a
rare
old
time
he
have
among
them
i
daresay
he
not
famous
for
character
he
ought
to
paint
the
princess
ziska
ah
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
that
lady
does
anyone
know
who
she
is
my
wife
is
very
anxious
to
find
out
whether
she
is
well
er
quite
the
proper
person
you
know
when
one
has
young
girls
one
can
not
be
too
careful
ross
courtney
the
man
on
the
divan
got
up
slowly
and
stretched
his
long
athletic
limbs
with
a
lazy
enjoyment
in
the
action
he
was
a
sporting
person
with
unhampered
means
and
large
estates
in
scotland
and
ireland
he
lived
a
joyous
life
of
wandering
about
the
world
in
search
of
adventures
and
he
had
a
scorn
of
civilized
conventionalities
newspapers
and
their
editors
among
them
and
whenever
sir
chetwynd
spoke
of
his
young
girls
he
was
moved
to
irreverent
smiling
as
he
knew
the
youngest
of
the
twain
was
at
least
thirty
he
also
recognized
and
avoided
the
wily
traps
and
pitfalls
set
for
him
by
lady
chetwynd
lyle
in
the
hope
that
he
would
yield
himself
up
a
captive
to
the
charms
of
muriel
or
dolly
and
as
he
thought
of
these
two
fair
ones
now
and
involuntarily
compared
them
in
his
mind
with
the
other
woman
just
spoken
of
the
smile
that
had
begun
to
hover
on
his
lips
deepened
unconsciously
till
his
handsome
face
was
quite
illumined
with
its
mirth
upon
my
word
i
do
think
it
matters
who
anybody
is
in
cairo
he
said
with
a
fine
carelessness
the
people
whose
families
are
all
guaranteed
respectable
are
more
lax
in
their
behavior
than
the
people
one
knows
nothing
about
as
for
the
princess
ziska
her
extraordinary
beauty
and
intelligence
would
give
her
the
entree
anywhere
even
if
she
had
money
to
back
those
qualities
up
she
enormously
wealthy
i
hear
said
young
lord
fulkeward
another
of
the
languid
smokers
caressing
his
scarcely
perceptible
moustache
my
mother
thinks
she
is
a
divorcee
sir
chetwynd
looked
very
serious
and
shook
his
fat
head
solemnly
well
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
being
divorced
you
know
laughed
ross
courtney
nowadays
it
seems
the
natural
and
fitting
end
of
marriage
sir
chetwynd
looked
graver
still
he
refused
to
be
drawn
into
this
kind
of
flippant
conversation
he
at
any
rate
was
respectably
married
he
had
no
sympathy
whatever
with
the
larger
majority
of
people
whose
marriages
were
a
failure
there
is
no
prince
ziska
then
he
inquired
the
name
sounds
to
me
of
russian
origin
and
i
imagined
my
wife
also
imagined
that
the
husband
of
the
lady
might
very
easily
be
in
russia
while
his
health
might
necessitate
her
wintering
in
egypt
the
russian
winter
climate
is
inclement
i
believe
that
would
be
a
very
neat
arrangement
yawned
lord
fulkeward
but
my
mother
thinks
not
my
mother
thinks
there
is
not
a
husband
at
all
that
there
never
was
a
husband
in
fact
my
mother
has
very
strong
convictions
on
the
subject
but
my
mother
intends
to
visit
her
all
the
same
she
does
lady
fulkeward
has
decided
on
that
oh
well
in
that
case
and
sir
chetwynd
expanded
his
of
course
lady
chetwynd
lyle
can
no
longer
have
any
scruples
on
the
subject
if
lady
fulkeward
visits
the
princess
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
actual
status
oh
i
do
know
murmured
lord
fulkeward
stroking
his
downy
lip
you
see
my
mother
rather
an
exceptional
person
when
the
governor
was
alive
she
hardly
ever
went
out
anywhere
you
know
and
all
the
people
who
came
to
our
house
in
yorkshire
had
to
bring
their
pedigrees
with
them
so
to
speak
it
was
beastly
dull
but
now
my
mother
has
taken
to
character
know
she
likes
all
sorts
of
people
about
her
and
the
more
mixed
they
are
the
more
she
is
delighted
with
them
fact
i
assure
you
quite
a
change
has
come
over
my
mother
since
the
poor
old
governor
died
ross
courtney
looked
amused
a
change
indeed
had
come
over
lady
fulkeward
a
change
sudden
mysterious
and
amazing
to
many
of
her
former
distinguished
friends
with
pedigrees
in
her
lifetime
her
hair
had
been
a
soft
her
face
pale
refined
and
serious
her
form
full
and
matronly
her
step
sober
and
discreet
but
two
years
after
the
death
of
the
kindly
and
noble
old
lord
who
had
cherished
her
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
up
to
the
last
moment
of
his
breath
had
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
england
she
appeared
with
golden
tresses
a
complexion
and
a
figure
which
had
been
so
massaged
rubbed
pressed
and
artistically
corseted
as
to
appear
positively
she
danced
like
a
fairy
she
who
had
once
been
called
old
lady
fulkeward
she
smoked
cigarettes
she
laughed
like
a
child
at
every
trivial
thing
any
joke
however
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
was
sufficient
to
stir
her
light
pulses
to
merriment
and
she
flirted
oh
heavens
how
she
flirted
with
a
skill
and
a
grace
and
a
knowledge
and
an
aplomb
that
nearly
drove
muriel
and
dolly
chetwynd
lyle
frantic
they
poor
things
were
beaten
out
of
the
field
altogether
by
her
superior
tact
and
art
of
fence
and
they
hated
her
accordingly
and
called
her
in
private
a
horrid
old
woman
which
perhaps
when
her
maid
undressed
her
she
was
but
she
was
having
a
distinctly
good
time
in
cairo
she
called
her
son
who
was
in
delicate
health
my
poor
dear
little
boy
and
he
though
on
his
last
birthday
was
reduced
to
such
an
abject
condition
of
servitude
by
her
assertiveness
impudent
gayety
and
general
freedom
of
manner
that
he
could
not
open
his
mouth
without
alluding
to
my
mother
and
using
my
mother
as
a
peg
whereon
to
hang
all
his
own
opinions
and
emotions
as
well
as
the
opinions
and
emotions
of
other
people
lady
fulkeward
admires
the
princess
very
much
i
believe
said
another
lounger
who
had
not
yet
spoken
oh
as
to
that
and
lord
fulkeward
roused
himself
to
some
faint
show
of
energy
who
would
admire
her
by
jove
only
i
tell
you
what
there
something
i
weird
about
her
eyes
fact
i
do
like
her
eyes
shut
up
fulke
she
has
beautiful
eyes
burst
out
courtney
hotly
then
flushing
suddenly
he
bit
his
lips
and
was
silent
who
is
this
that
has
beautiful
eyes
suddenly
demanded
a
slow
gruff
voice
and
a
little
thin
gentleman
dressed
in
a
kind
of
academic
gown
and
cap
appeared
on
the
scene
hullo
here
our
exclaimed
lord
fulkeward
by
jove
is
that
the
style
you
have
got
yourself
up
in
for
tonight
it
looks
awfully
smart
know
the
personage
thus
complimented
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
surveyed
his
acquaintances
with
a
very
air
in
truth
maxwell
dean
had
some
reason
for
if
the
knowledge
that
he
possessed
one
of
the
cleverest
heads
in
europe
could
give
a
man
cause
for
pride
he
was
apparently
the
only
individual
in
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
who
had
come
to
egypt
for
any
serious
purpose
a
purpose
he
had
though
what
it
was
he
declined
to
explain
reticent
often
brusque
and
sometimes
mysterious
in
his
manner
of
speech
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
he
was
at
work
on
something
and
that
he
also
had
a
very
trying
habit
of
closely
studying
every
object
small
or
great
that
came
under
his
observation
he
studied
the
natives
to
such
an
extent
that
he
knew
every
differing
shade
of
color
in
their
skins
he
studied
sir
chetwynd
lyle
and
knew
that
he
occasionally
took
bribes
to
put
things
into
his
paper
he
studied
dolly
and
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
and
knew
that
they
would
never
succeed
in
getting
husbands
he
studied
lady
fulkeward
and
thought
her
very
well
got
up
for
sixty
he
studied
ross
courtney
and
knew
he
would
never
do
anything
but
kill
animals
all
his
life
and
he
studied
the
working
of
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
and
saw
a
fortune
rising
out
of
it
for
the
proprietors
but
apart
from
these
ordinary
surface
things
he
studied
other
matters
occult
peculiarities
of
temperament
coincidences
strange
occurrences
generally
he
could
read
the
egyptian
hieroglyphs
perfectly
and
he
understood
the
difference
between
royal
cartouche
scarabei
and
ones
he
was
never
dull
he
had
plenty
to
do
and
he
took
everything
as
it
came
in
its
turn
even
the
costume
ball
for
which
he
had
now
attired
himself
did
not
present
itself
to
him
as
a
bore
but
as
a
new
vein
of
information
opening
to
him
fresh
glimpses
of
the
genus
homo
as
seen
in
a
state
of
eccentricity
i
think
he
now
said
complacently
that
the
cap
and
gown
look
well
for
a
man
of
my
years
it
is
a
simple
garb
but
cool
convenient
and
not
unbecoming
i
had
thought
at
first
of
adopting
the
dress
of
an
ancient
egyptian
priest
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
secure
the
complete
outfit
i
would
never
wear
a
costume
of
the
kind
that
was
not
in
every
point
historically
correct
no
one
smiled
no
one
would
have
dared
to
smile
at
maxwell
dean
when
he
spoke
of
historically
correct
things
he
had
studied
them
as
he
had
studied
everything
and
he
knew
all
about
them
sir
chetwynd
murmured
quite
right
er
the
ancient
designs
were
very
elaborate
and
symbolic
finished
dean
symbolic
of
very
curious
meanings
i
assure
you
but
i
fear
i
have
interrupted
your
talk
courtney
was
speaking
about
somebody
beautiful
eyes
who
is
the
fair
one
in
question
the
princess
ziska
said
lord
fulkeward
i
was
saying
that
i
quite
like
the
look
of
her
eyes
why
not
why
not
demanded
the
doctor
with
sudden
asperity
the
matter
with
them
everything
the
matter
with
them
replied
ross
courtney
with
a
forced
laugh
they
are
too
splendid
and
wild
for
fulke
he
likes
the
english
better
than
the
egyptian
no
i
do
said
lord
fulkeward
speaking
more
animatedly
than
was
customary
with
him
i
hate
eyes
i
prefer
soft
ones
like
miss
murray
miss
helen
murray
is
a
very
charming
young
lady
said
dean
but
her
beauty
is
quite
of
an
ordinary
type
while
that
of
the
princess
ziska
is
exactly
that
just
what
i
say
declared
courtney
i
think
she
is
the
loveliest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
little
doctor
looked
with
a
curiosity
from
one
man
to
the
other
sir
chetwynd
lyle
rose
ponderously
up
from
the
depths
of
his
i
think
said
he
i
had
better
go
and
get
into
my
uniform
the
windsor
you
know
i
always
have
it
with
me
wherever
i
go
it
comes
in
very
useful
for
fancy
balls
such
as
the
one
we
are
going
to
have
tonight
when
no
particular
period
is
observed
in
costume
is
it
about
time
we
all
got
ready
upon
my
life
i
think
it
is
agreed
lord
fulkeward
i
am
coming
out
as
a
neapolitan
fisherman
i
do
believe
neapolitan
fishermen
ever
really
dress
in
the
way
i
going
to
make
up
but
it
the
accepted
know
ah
i
daresay
you
will
look
very
well
in
it
murmured
ross
courtney
vaguely
hullo
here
comes
denzil
murray
they
all
turned
instinctively
to
watch
the
entrance
of
a
handsome
young
man
attired
in
the
picturesque
garb
worn
by
florentine
nobles
during
the
prosperous
reign
of
the
medicis
it
was
a
costume
admirably
adapted
to
the
wearer
who
being
grave
and
almost
stern
of
feature
needed
the
brightness
of
jewels
and
the
gloss
of
velvet
and
satin
to
throw
out
the
classic
contour
of
his
fine
head
and
enhance
the
lustre
of
his
brooding
eyes
denzil
murray
was
a
highlander
the
level
brows
the
firm
lips
the
straight
fearless
look
all
bespoke
him
a
son
of
the
mountains
and
a
descendant
of
the
proud
races
that
scorned
the
sassenach
and
retained
sufficient
of
the
material
whereof
their
early
phoenician
ancestors
were
made
to
be
capable
of
both
the
extremes
of
hate
and
love
in
their
most
potent
forms
he
moved
slowly
towards
the
group
of
men
awaiting
his
approach
with
a
reserved
air
of
something
like
hauteur
it
was
possible
he
was
conscious
of
his
good
looks
but
it
was
equally
evident
that
he
did
not
desire
to
be
made
the
object
of
impertinent
remark
his
friends
silently
recognized
this
and
only
lord
fulkeward
moved
to
a
mild
transport
of
admiration
ventured
to
comment
on
his
appearance
i
say
denzil
you
awfully
well
got
up
awfully
well
magnificent
denzil
murray
bowed
with
a
somewhat
wearied
and
sarcastic
air
when
one
is
in
rome
or
egypt
one
must
do
as
rome
or
egypt
does
he
said
carelessly
if
hotel
proprietors
will
give
fancy
balls
it
is
necessary
to
rise
to
the
occasion
you
look
very
well
doctor
why
do
you
other
fellows
go
and
get
your
toggeries
on
it
past
ten
and
the
princess
ziska
will
be
here
by
eleven
there
are
other
people
coming
besides
the
princess
ziska
are
there
not
mr
murray
inquired
sir
chetwynd
lyle
with
an
obtrusively
bantering
air
denzil
murray
glanced
him
over
disdainfully
i
believe
there
are
he
answered
coolly
otherwise
the
ball
would
scarcely
pay
its
expenses
but
as
the
princess
is
admittedly
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
cairo
this
season
she
will
naturally
be
the
centre
of
attraction
that
why
i
mentioned
she
would
be
here
at
eleven
she
told
you
that
inquired
ross
courtney
she
did
courtney
looked
up
then
down
and
seemed
about
to
speak
again
but
checked
himself
and
finally
strolled
off
followed
by
lord
fulkeward
i
hear
said
dean
then
addressing
denzil
murray
that
a
great
celebrity
has
arrived
at
this
hotel
the
painter
armand
gervase
denzil
face
brightened
instantly
with
a
pleasant
smile
the
dearest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
he
said
yes
he
is
here
i
met
him
outside
the
door
this
afternoon
we
are
very
old
chums
i
have
stayed
with
him
in
paris
and
he
has
stayed
with
me
in
scotland
a
charming
fellow
he
is
very
french
in
his
ideas
but
he
knows
england
well
and
speaks
english
perfectly
french
in
his
ideas
echoed
sir
chetwynd
lyle
who
was
just
preparing
to
leave
the
lounge
dear
me
how
is
that
he
is
a
frenchman
said
dean
suavely
therefore
that
his
ideas
should
be
french
ought
not
to
be
a
matter
of
surprise
to
us
my
dear
sir
chetwynd
sir
chetwynd
snorted
he
had
a
suspicion
that
he
the
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
daily
dial
was
being
laughed
at
and
he
at
once
clambered
on
his
high
horse
of
british
morality
frenchman
or
no
frenchman
he
observed
the
ideas
promulgated
in
france
at
the
present
day
are
distinctly
profane
and
pernicious
there
is
a
lack
of
principle
a
want
of
rectitude
in
er
the
french
press
for
example
that
is
highly
deplorable
and
is
the
english
press
immaculate
asked
denzil
languidly
we
hope
so
replied
sir
chetwynd
we
do
our
best
to
make
it
so
and
with
that
remark
he
took
his
paunch
and
himself
away
into
retirement
leaving
dean
and
young
murray
facing
each
other
a
singular
pair
enough
in
the
contrast
of
their
appearance
and
dress
the
one
small
lean
and
wiry
in
academic
gown
the
other
tall
broad
and
muscular
clad
in
the
rich
attire
of
mediaeval
florence
and
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
fine
picture
of
that
period
stepped
out
from
its
frame
there
was
a
silence
between
them
for
a
moment
then
the
doctor
spoke
in
a
low
tone
it
wo
do
my
dear
boy
i
assure
you
it
wo
do
you
will
break
your
heart
over
a
dream
and
make
yourself
miserable
for
nothing
and
you
will
break
your
sister
heart
as
well
perhaps
you
have
thought
of
that
denzil
flung
himself
into
the
chair
sir
chetwynd
had
just
vacated
and
gave
vent
to
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
helen
does
know
anything
yet
he
said
hoarsely
i
know
nothing
myself
how
can
i
i
have
said
a
word
to
to
her
if
i
spoke
all
that
was
in
my
mind
i
daresay
she
would
laugh
at
me
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
guessed
my
secret
you
saw
me
last
night
when
i
when
i
accompanied
her
home
but
i
never
passed
her
palace
gates
she
would
let
me
she
bade
me
outside
a
servant
admitted
her
and
she
vanished
through
the
portal
like
a
witch
or
a
ghost
sometimes
i
fancy
she
is
a
ghost
she
is
so
white
so
light
so
noiseless
and
so
lovely
he
turned
his
eyes
away
ashamed
of
the
emotion
that
moved
him
maxwell
dean
took
off
his
academic
cap
and
examined
its
interior
as
though
he
considered
it
remarkable
yes
he
said
slowly
i
have
thought
the
same
thing
of
her
myself
sometimes
further
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
military
band
of
the
evening
which
now
crossed
the
lounge
each
man
carrying
his
instrument
with
him
and
these
were
followed
by
several
groups
of
people
in
fancy
dress
all
ready
and
eager
for
the
ball
pierrots
and
pierrettes
monks
in
drooping
cowls
symbolic
figures
of
night
and
morning
mingled
with
the
counterfeit
presentments
of
kings
and
queens
began
to
flock
together
laughing
and
talking
on
their
way
to
the
and
presently
among
them
came
a
man
whose
superior
height
and
build
combined
with
his
eminently
picturesque
type
of
beauty
caused
every
one
to
turn
and
watch
him
as
he
passed
and
murmur
whispering
comments
on
the
various
qualities
wherein
he
differed
from
themselves
he
was
attired
for
the
occasion
as
a
bedouin
chief
and
his
fierce
black
eyes
and
dark
hair
combined
with
the
natural
olive
tint
of
his
complexion
were
well
set
off
by
the
snowy
folds
of
his
turban
and
the
whiteness
of
his
entire
costume
which
was
unrelieved
by
any
color
save
at
the
waist
where
a
gleam
of
scarlet
was
shown
in
the
sash
which
helped
to
fasten
a
dagger
and
other
correct
weapons
of
attack
to
his
belt
he
entered
the
hall
with
a
swift
and
singularly
light
step
and
made
straight
for
denzil
murray
ah
here
you
are
he
said
speaking
english
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
which
was
more
agreeable
to
the
ear
than
otherwise
but
my
excellent
boy
what
magnificence
a
medici
costume
never
say
to
me
that
you
are
not
vain
you
are
as
conscious
of
your
good
looks
as
any
pretty
woman
behold
me
how
simple
and
unobtrusive
i
am
he
laughed
and
murray
sprang
up
from
the
chair
where
he
had
been
despondently
reclining
oh
come
i
like
that
he
exclaimed
simple
and
unobtrusive
why
everybody
is
staring
at
you
now
as
if
you
had
dropped
from
the
moon
you
can
not
be
armand
gervase
and
simple
and
unobtrusive
at
the
same
time
why
not
demanded
gervase
lightly
fame
is
capricious
and
her
trumpet
is
not
loud
enough
to
be
heard
all
over
the
world
at
once
the
venerable
proprietor
of
the
dirty
bazaar
where
i
managed
to
purchase
these
charming
articles
of
bedouin
costume
had
never
heard
of
me
in
his
life
miserable
man
he
does
not
know
what
he
has
missed
here
his
flashing
black
eyes
lit
suddenly
on
dean
who
was
studying
him
in
the
same
sort
of
pertinacious
way
in
which
that
learned
little
man
studied
everything
a
friend
of
yours
denzil
he
inquired
yes
responded
murray
readily
a
very
great
friend
maxwell
dean
dean
let
me
introduce
to
you
armand
gervase
i
need
not
explain
him
further
you
need
not
indeed
said
the
doctor
with
a
ceremonious
bow
the
name
is
one
of
universal
celebrity
it
is
not
always
an
advantage
this
universal
celebrity
replied
gervase
nor
is
it
true
that
any
celebrity
is
actually
universal
perhaps
the
only
living
person
that
is
universally
known
by
name
at
least
is
zola
mankind
are
at
one
in
their
appreciation
of
vice
i
can
not
altogether
agree
with
you
there
said
dean
slowly
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
artist
bold
proud
features
with
singular
curiosity
the
french
academy
i
presume
are
individually
as
appreciative
of
human
weaknesses
as
most
men
but
taken
collectively
some
spirit
higher
and
stronger
than
their
own
keeps
them
unanimous
in
their
rejection
of
the
notorious
realist
who
sacrifices
all
the
canons
of
art
and
beauty
to
the
discussion
of
topics
unmentionable
in
decent
society
gervase
laughed
idly
oh
he
will
get
in
some
day
you
may
be
sure
he
answered
there
is
no
spirit
higher
and
stronger
than
the
spirit
of
naturalism
in
man
and
in
time
when
a
few
prejudices
have
died
away
and
mawkish
sentiment
has
been
worn
threadbare
zola
will
be
enrolled
as
the
first
of
the
french
academicians
with
even
more
honors
than
if
he
had
succeeded
in
the
beginning
that
is
the
way
of
all
those
bodies
as
napoleon
said
monde
vient
a
celui
qui
sait
attendre
the
little
doctor
countenance
now
showed
the
most
lively
and
eager
interest
you
quite
believe
that
monsieur
gervase
you
are
entirely
sure
of
what
you
said
just
now
what
did
i
say
i
forget
smiled
gervase
lighting
a
cigarette
and
beginning
to
smoke
it
leisurely
you
said
is
no
spirit
higher
or
stronger
than
the
spirit
of
naturalism
in
man
are
you
positive
on
this
point
why
of
course
most
entirely
positive
and
the
great
painter
looked
amused
as
he
gave
the
reply
naturalism
is
nature
or
the
things
appertaining
to
nature
and
there
is
nothing
higher
or
stronger
than
nature
everywhere
and
anywhere
how
about
god
inquired
dean
with
a
curious
air
as
if
he
were
propounding
a
remarkable
conundrum
god
gervase
laughed
loudly
pardon
are
you
a
clergyman
by
no
means
and
the
doctor
gave
a
little
bow
and
deprecating
smile
i
am
not
in
any
way
connected
with
the
church
i
am
a
doctor
of
laws
and
literature
a
humble
student
of
philosophy
and
science
generally
philosophy
science
interrupted
gervase
and
you
ask
about
god
parbleu
science
and
philosophy
have
progressed
beyond
him
exactly
and
dean
rubbed
his
hands
together
pleasantly
that
is
your
opinion
yes
i
thought
so
science
and
philosophy
to
put
it
comprehensively
have
beaten
poor
god
on
his
own
ground
ha
ha
ha
very
good
very
good
and
humorous
as
well
ha
ha
and
a
very
droll
appearance
just
then
had
this
humble
student
of
philosophy
and
science
generally
for
he
bent
himself
to
and
fro
with
laughter
and
his
small
eyes
almost
disappeared
behind
his
shelving
brows
in
the
excess
of
his
mirth
and
two
crosslines
formed
themselves
near
his
thin
mouth
such
lines
as
are
carven
on
the
ancient
greek
masks
which
indicate
satire
denzil
murray
flushed
uncomfortably
gervase
does
believe
in
anything
but
art
he
said
as
though
half
apologizing
for
his
friend
art
is
the
sole
object
of
his
existence
i
do
believe
he
ever
has
time
to
think
about
anything
else
of
what
else
should
i
think
mon
ami
exclaimed
gervase
mirthfully
of
life
it
is
all
art
to
me
and
by
art
i
mean
the
idealization
and
transfiguration
of
nature
oh
if
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
you
are
a
romancist
interposed
dean
emphatically
nature
neither
idealizes
nor
transfigures
itself
it
is
simply
nature
and
no
more
matter
uncontrolled
by
spirit
is
anything
but
ideal
precisely
answered
gervase
quickly
and
with
some
warmth
but
my
spirit
idealizes
it
my
imagination
sees
beyond
it
my
soul
grasps
it
oh
you
have
a
soul
exclaimed
dean
beginning
to
laugh
again
now
how
did
you
find
that
out
gervase
looked
at
him
in
a
sudden
surprise
every
man
has
an
inward
self
naturally
he
said
we
call
it
as
a
figure
of
speech
it
is
really
temperament
merely
oh
it
is
merely
temperament
then
you
do
think
it
is
likely
to
outlive
you
this
soul
to
take
new
phases
upon
itself
and
go
on
existing
an
immortal
being
when
your
body
is
in
a
far
worse
condition
because
less
carefully
preserved
than
an
egyptian
mummy
certainly
not
and
gervase
flung
away
the
end
of
his
finished
cigarette
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
quite
an
exploded
theory
it
was
always
a
ridiculous
one
we
have
quite
enough
to
vex
us
in
our
present
life
and
why
men
ever
set
about
inventing
another
is
more
than
i
am
able
to
understand
it
was
a
most
foolish
and
barbaric
superstition
the
gay
sound
of
music
now
floated
towards
them
from
the
the
strains
of
a
graceful
joyous
waltz
came
rhythmically
beating
on
the
air
like
the
measured
movement
of
wings
and
denzil
murray
beginning
to
grow
restless
walked
to
and
fro
his
eyes
watching
every
figure
that
crossed
and
the
hall
but
dean
interest
in
armand
gervase
remained
intense
and
unabated
and
approaching
him
he
laid
two
lean
fingers
delicately
on
the
white
folds
of
the
bedouin
dress
just
where
the
heart
of
the
man
was
hidden
foolish
and
barbaric
superstition
he
echoed
slowly
and
meditatively
you
do
not
believe
in
any
possibility
of
there
being
a
life
or
several
lives
after
this
present
death
through
which
we
must
all
pass
inevitably
sooner
or
later
not
in
the
least
i
leave
such
ideas
to
the
ignorant
and
uneducated
i
should
be
unworthy
of
the
progressive
teachings
of
my
time
if
i
believed
such
arrant
nonsense
death
you
consider
finishes
all
there
is
nothing
further
no
mysteries
beyond
and
dean
eyes
glittered
as
he
stretched
forth
one
thin
slight
hand
and
pointed
into
space
with
the
word
beyond
an
action
which
gave
it
a
curious
emphasis
and
for
a
fleeting
second
left
a
weird
impression
on
even
the
careless
mind
of
gervase
but
he
laughed
it
off
lightly
nothing
beyond
of
course
not
my
dear
sir
why
ask
such
a
question
nothing
can
be
plainer
or
more
positive
than
the
fact
that
death
as
you
say
finishes
all
a
woman
laugh
low
and
exquisitely
musical
rippled
on
the
air
as
he
spoke
delicious
laughter
rarer
than
song
for
women
as
a
rule
laugh
too
loudly
and
the
sound
of
their
merriment
partakes
more
of
the
nature
of
a
goose
cackle
than
any
other
sort
of
natural
melody
but
this
large
soft
and
silvery
was
like
a
delicately
subdued
cadence
played
on
a
magic
flute
in
the
distance
and
suggested
nothing
but
sweetness
and
at
the
sound
of
it
gervase
started
violently
and
turned
sharply
round
upon
his
friend
murray
with
a
look
of
wonderment
and
perplexity
who
is
that
he
demanded
i
have
heard
that
pretty
laugh
before
it
must
be
some
one
i
know
but
denzil
scarcely
heard
him
pale
and
with
eyes
full
of
yearning
and
passion
he
was
watching
the
slow
approach
of
a
group
of
people
in
fancy
dress
who
were
all
eagerly
pressing
round
one
central
figure
the
figure
of
a
woman
clad
in
gleaming
golden
tissues
and
veiled
in
the
old
egyptian
fashion
up
to
the
eyes
with
jewels
flashing
about
her
waist
bosom
and
hair
a
woman
who
moved
glidingly
as
if
she
floated
rather
than
walked
and
whose
beauty
half
hidden
as
it
was
by
the
exigencies
of
the
costume
she
had
chosen
was
so
unusual
and
brilliant
that
it
seemed
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
bewilderment
and
rapture
around
her
as
she
came
she
was
preceded
by
a
small
nubian
boy
in
a
costume
of
vivid
scarlet
who
walking
backwards
humbly
fanned
her
slowly
with
a
tall
fan
of
peacock
plumes
made
after
the
quaint
designs
of
ancient
egypt
the
lustre
radiating
from
the
feathers
the
light
of
her
golden
garments
her
jewels
and
the
marvellous
black
splendor
of
her
eyes
all
flashed
for
a
moment
like
sudden
lightning
on
gervase
something
he
knew
not
what
turned
him
giddy
and
blind
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
sprang
eagerly
forward
when
all
at
once
he
felt
the
lean
small
hand
of
dean
on
his
arm
and
stopped
short
embarrassed
pardon
me
said
the
little
savant
with
a
delicate
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
but
do
you
know
the
princess
ziska
chapter
ii
gervase
stared
at
him
still
dazzled
and
confused
whom
did
you
say
the
princess
ziska
no
i
do
know
her
yet
stay
yes
i
think
i
have
seen
her
somewhere
in
paris
possibly
will
you
introduce
me
i
leave
that
duty
to
denzil
murray
said
the
doctor
folding
his
arms
neatly
behind
his
back
he
knows
her
better
than
i
do
and
smiling
his
little
grim
cynical
smile
he
settled
his
academic
cap
more
firmly
on
his
head
and
strolled
off
towards
the
ballroom
gervase
stood
irresolute
his
eyes
fixed
on
that
wondrous
golden
figure
that
floated
before
his
eyes
like
an
aerial
vision
denzil
murray
had
gone
forward
to
meet
the
princess
and
was
now
talking
to
her
his
handsome
face
radiating
with
the
admiration
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
after
a
little
pause
gervase
moved
towards
him
a
step
or
two
and
caught
part
of
the
conversation
you
look
the
very
of
an
egyptian
princess
murray
was
saying
your
costume
is
perfect
she
laughed
again
that
sweet
rare
laughter
gervase
thrilled
with
the
pulsation
of
it
it
beat
in
his
ears
and
smote
his
brain
with
a
strange
echo
of
familiarity
is
it
not
she
responded
i
am
correct
as
your
friend
dean
would
say
my
ornaments
are
genuine
they
all
came
out
of
the
same
tomb
i
find
one
fault
with
your
attire
princess
said
one
of
the
male
admirers
who
had
entered
with
her
part
of
your
face
is
veiled
that
is
a
cruelty
to
us
all
she
waived
the
compliment
aside
with
a
light
gesture
it
was
the
fashion
in
ancient
egypt
she
said
love
in
those
old
days
was
not
what
it
is
now
one
glance
one
smile
was
sufficient
to
set
the
soul
on
fire
and
draw
another
soul
towards
it
to
consume
together
in
the
suddenly
kindled
flame
and
women
veiled
their
faces
in
youth
lest
they
should
be
deemed
too
prodigal
of
their
charms
and
in
age
they
covered
themselves
still
more
closely
in
order
not
to
affront
the
fairness
by
their
wrinkles
she
smiled
a
dazzling
smile
that
drew
gervase
yet
a
few
steps
closer
unconsciously
as
though
he
were
being
magnetized
but
i
am
not
bound
to
keep
the
veil
always
up
and
as
she
spoke
she
loosened
it
and
let
it
fall
showing
an
exquisite
face
fair
as
a
lily
and
of
such
perfect
loveliness
that
the
men
who
were
gathered
round
her
seemed
to
lose
breath
and
speech
at
sight
of
it
that
pleases
you
better
mr
murray
denzil
grew
very
pale
bending
down
he
murmured
something
to
her
in
a
low
tone
she
raised
her
lovely
brows
with
a
little
touch
of
surprise
that
was
half
disdain
and
looked
at
him
straightly
you
say
very
pretty
things
but
they
do
not
always
please
me
she
observed
however
that
is
my
fault
no
doubt
and
she
began
to
move
onwards
her
nubian
page
preceding
her
as
before
gervase
stood
in
her
path
and
confronted
her
as
she
came
introduce
me
he
said
in
a
commanding
tone
to
denzil
denzil
looked
at
him
somewhat
startled
by
the
suppressed
passion
in
his
voice
certainly
princess
permit
me
she
paused
a
figure
of
silent
grace
and
attention
allow
me
to
present
to
you
my
friend
armand
gervase
the
most
famous
artist
in
france
gervase
the
princess
ziska
she
raised
her
deep
dark
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
his
face
and
as
he
looked
boldly
at
her
in
a
kind
of
audacious
admiration
he
felt
again
that
strange
dizzying
shock
which
had
before
thrilled
him
through
and
through
there
was
something
strangely
familiar
about
her
the
faint
odors
that
seemed
exhaled
from
her
garments
the
gleam
of
the
scarabei
on
her
breast
the
weird
light
of
the
serpent
in
her
hair
and
more
much
more
familiar
than
these
trifles
was
the
sound
of
her
voice
dulcet
penetrating
grave
and
haunting
in
its
tone
at
last
we
meet
monsieur
armand
gervase
she
said
slowly
and
with
a
graceful
inclination
of
her
head
but
i
can
not
look
upon
you
as
a
stranger
for
i
have
known
you
so
long
in
spirit
she
smiled
a
strange
smile
dazzling
yet
enigmatical
and
something
wild
and
voluptuous
seemed
to
stir
in
gervase
pulses
as
he
touched
the
small
hand
loaded
with
quaint
egyptian
gems
which
she
graciously
extended
towards
him
i
think
i
have
known
you
too
he
said
possibly
in
a
dream
a
dream
of
beauty
never
realized
till
now
his
voice
sank
to
an
amorous
whisper
but
she
said
nothing
in
reply
nor
could
her
looks
be
construed
into
any
expression
of
either
pleasure
or
offence
yet
through
the
heart
of
young
denzil
murray
went
a
sudden
pang
of
jealousy
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
became
conscious
that
even
among
men
as
well
as
women
there
may
exist
what
is
called
the
petty
envy
of
a
possible
rival
and
the
uneasy
desire
to
outshine
such
an
one
in
all
points
of
appearance
dress
and
manner
his
gaze
rested
broodingly
on
the
tall
muscular
form
of
gervase
and
he
noted
the
symmetry
and
supple
grace
of
the
man
with
an
irritation
of
which
he
was
ashamed
he
knew
despite
his
own
undeniably
handsome
personality
which
was
set
off
to
such
advantage
that
night
by
the
richness
of
the
florentine
costume
he
had
adopted
that
there
was
a
certain
fascination
about
gervase
which
was
inborn
a
trick
of
manner
which
made
him
seem
picturesque
at
all
times
and
that
even
when
the
great
french
artist
had
stayed
with
him
in
scotland
and
got
himself
up
for
the
occasion
in
more
or
less
baggy
tweeds
people
were
fond
of
remarking
that
the
only
man
who
ever
succeeded
in
making
tweeds
look
artistic
was
armand
gervase
and
in
the
white
bedouin
garb
he
now
wore
he
was
seen
at
his
best
a
certain
restless
passion
betrayed
in
eyes
and
lips
made
him
look
the
savage
part
he
had
dressed
for
and
as
he
bent
his
head
over
the
princess
ziska
hand
and
kissed
it
with
an
odd
mingling
of
flippancy
and
reverence
denzil
suddenly
began
to
think
how
curiously
alike
they
were
these
two
strong
man
and
fair
woman
both
had
many
physical
points
in
common
the
same
dark
level
brows
the
same
half
wild
half
tender
eyes
the
same
sinuous
grace
of
form
the
same
peculiar
lightness
of
movement
and
yet
both
were
different
while
resembling
each
other
it
was
not
what
is
called
a
family
likeness
which
existed
between
them
it
was
the
cast
of
countenance
or
type
that
exists
between
races
or
tribes
and
had
young
murray
not
known
his
friend
gervase
to
be
a
french
provencal
and
equally
understood
the
princess
ziska
to
be
of
russian
origin
he
would
have
declared
them
both
natives
of
egypt
of
the
purest
caste
and
highest
breeding
he
was
so
struck
by
this
idea
that
he
might
have
spoken
his
thought
aloud
had
he
not
heard
gervase
boldly
arranging
dance
after
dance
with
the
princess
and
apparently
preparing
to
write
no
name
but
hers
down
the
entire
length
of
his
ball
programme
a
piece
of
audacity
which
had
the
effect
of
rousing
denzil
to
assert
his
own
rights
you
promised
me
the
first
waltz
princess
he
said
his
face
flushing
as
he
spoke
quite
true
and
you
shall
have
it
she
replied
smiling
monsieur
gervase
will
have
the
second
the
music
sounds
very
inviting
shall
we
not
go
in
we
spoil
the
effect
of
your
entree
crowding
about
you
like
this
said
denzil
glancing
somewhat
sullenly
at
gervase
and
the
other
men
surrounding
her
and
by
the
way
you
have
never
told
us
what
character
you
represent
some
great
queen
of
old
time
no
doubt
no
i
lay
no
claim
to
sovereignty
she
answered
i
am
for
the
living
picture
of
a
once
famous
and
very
improper
person
who
bore
half
my
name
a
dancer
of
old
time
known
as
the
favorite
of
the
harem
of
a
great
egyptian
warrior
described
in
forgotten
histories
as
mighty
araxes
she
paused
her
admirers
fascinated
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
were
all
silent
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
gervase
and
addressing
him
only
continued
yes
i
am
she
said
she
was
as
i
tell
you
an
person
or
would
be
so
considered
by
the
good
english
people
because
you
know
she
was
never
married
to
araxes
this
explanation
given
with
the
demurest
naivete
caused
a
laugh
among
her
listeners
that
would
make
her
in
france
said
gervase
gayly
she
would
only
seem
more
interesting
ah
then
modern
france
is
like
old
egypt
she
queried
still
smiling
and
frenchmen
can
be
found
perhaps
who
are
like
araxes
in
the
number
of
their
loves
and
infidelities
i
should
say
my
country
is
populated
entirely
with
copies
of
him
replied
gervase
mirthfully
was
he
a
very
distinguished
personage
he
was
old
legends
say
he
was
the
greatest
warrior
of
his
time
as
you
monsieur
gervase
are
the
greatest
artist
gervase
bowed
you
flatter
me
fair
charmazel
he
said
then
suddenly
as
the
strange
name
passed
his
lips
he
recoiled
as
if
he
had
been
stung
and
seemed
for
a
moment
dazed
the
princess
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
him
inquiringly
something
troubles
you
monsieur
gervase
she
asked
his
brows
knitted
in
a
perplexed
frown
nothing
the
heat
the
air
a
trifle
i
assure
you
will
you
not
join
the
dancers
denzil
the
music
calls
you
when
your
waltz
with
the
princess
is
ended
i
shall
claim
my
turn
for
the
moment
au
revoir
he
stood
aside
and
let
the
little
group
pass
him
by
the
princess
ziska
moving
with
her
floating
noiseless
grace
denzil
murray
beside
her
the
little
nubian
boy
waving
the
in
front
of
them
both
and
all
the
other
enslaved
admirers
of
this
singularly
attractive
woman
crowding
together
behind
he
watched
the
little
cortege
with
strained
dim
sight
till
just
at
the
dividing
portal
between
the
lounge
and
the
ballroom
the
princess
turned
and
looked
back
at
him
with
a
smile
over
all
the
intervening
heads
their
eyes
met
in
one
flash
of
mutual
comprehension
then
as
the
fair
face
vanished
like
a
light
absorbed
into
the
lights
beyond
it
gervase
left
alone
dropped
heavily
into
a
chair
and
stared
vaguely
at
the
elaborate
pattern
of
the
thick
carpet
at
his
feet
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
he
withdrew
it
wet
with
drops
of
perspiration
what
is
wrong
with
me
he
muttered
am
i
sickening
for
a
fever
before
i
have
been
hours
in
cairo
what
fool
notion
is
this
in
my
brain
where
have
i
seen
her
before
in
paris
petersburg
london
charmazel
charmazel
what
has
the
name
to
do
with
me
it
is
like
the
name
of
a
romance
or
a
gypsy
tune
bah
i
must
be
dreaming
her
face
her
eyes
are
perfectly
familiar
where
where
have
i
seen
her
and
played
the
mad
fool
with
her
before
was
she
a
model
at
one
of
the
studios
have
i
seen
her
by
chance
thus
in
her
days
of
poverty
and
does
her
image
recall
itself
vividly
now
despite
her
changed
surroundings
i
know
the
very
perfume
of
her
hair
it
seems
to
creep
into
my
blood
it
intoxicates
me
it
chokes
me
he
sprang
up
with
a
fierce
gesture
then
after
a
minute
pause
sat
down
again
and
again
stared
at
the
floor
the
gay
music
from
the
danced
towards
him
on
the
air
in
sweet
broken
echoes
he
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
my
god
he
said
at
last
under
his
breath
can
it
be
possible
that
i
love
this
woman
chapter
iii
within
the
the
tide
of
gayety
was
rising
to
its
height
it
may
be
a
very
trivial
matter
yet
it
is
certain
that
fancy
dress
gives
a
peculiar
charm
freedom
and
brightness
to
festivities
of
the
kind
and
men
who
in
the
ordinary
mournful
black
would
be
taciturn
of
speech
and
conventional
in
bearing
throw
off
their
customary
reserve
when
they
find
themselves
in
the
brilliant
and
becoming
attire
of
some
picturesque
period
when
dress
was
an
art
as
well
as
a
fashion
and
not
only
do
they
look
their
best
but
they
somehow
manage
to
put
on
manner
with
costume
and
to
become
courteous
witty
and
graceful
to
a
degree
that
sometimes
causes
their
own
relatives
to
wonder
at
them
and
speculate
as
to
why
they
have
grown
so
suddenly
interesting
few
have
read
sartor
resartus
with
either
comprehension
or
profit
and
are
therefore
unaware
as
teufelsdrockh
was
that
society
is
founded
upon
cloth
that
man
does
adapt
his
manners
very
much
to
suit
his
clothes
and
that
as
the
costume
of
the
days
of
louis
quinze
or
louis
seize
inspired
graceful
deportment
and
studied
courtesy
to
women
so
does
the
costume
of
our
nineteenth
century
inspire
brusque
demeanor
and
curt
forms
of
speech
which
however
sincere
are
not
flattering
to
the
fair
sex
more
goes
on
at
a
ball
than
at
an
ordinary
one
and
numerous
were
the
couples
that
strolled
through
the
corridors
and
along
the
terraces
of
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
when
after
the
first
dozen
dances
were
ended
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
most
glorious
of
full
moons
had
risen
over
the
turrets
and
minarets
of
cairo
illumining
every
visible
object
with
as
clear
a
lustre
as
that
of
day
then
it
was
that
warriors
and
nobles
of
mediaeval
days
were
seen
strolling
with
mythological
goddesses
and
peasants
of
italy
and
spain
then
audacious
toreadors
were
perceived
whispering
in
the
ears
of
crowned
queens
and
clowns
were
caught
lingering
amorously
by
the
side
of
impossible
of
all
nations
then
it
was
that
sir
chetwynd
lyle
with
his
paunch
discreetly
restrained
within
the
limits
of
a
windsor
uniform
which
had
been
made
for
him
some
two
or
three
years
since
paced
up
and
down
complacently
in
the
moonlight
watching
his
two
girls
muriel
and
dolly
doing
business
with
certain
eligibles
then
it
was
that
lady
fulkeward
fearfully
and
wonderfully
got
up
as
the
duchess
of
gainsborough
sidled
to
and
fro
flirted
with
this
man
flouted
that
giggled
shrugged
her
shoulders
waved
her
fan
and
comported
herself
altogether
as
if
she
were
a
hoyden
of
seventeen
just
let
loose
from
school
for
the
holidays
and
then
the
worthy
maxwell
dean
somewhat
exhausted
by
vigorous
capering
in
the
lancers
strolled
forth
to
inhale
the
air
fanning
himself
with
his
cap
as
he
walked
and
listening
keenly
to
every
chance
word
or
sentence
he
could
hear
whether
it
concerned
himself
or
not
he
had
peculiar
theories
and
one
of
them
was
as
he
would
tell
you
that
if
you
overheard
a
remark
apparently
not
intended
for
you
you
were
to
make
yourself
quite
easy
as
it
was
a
point
of
predestination
that
you
should
at
that
particular
moment
consciously
or
unconsciously
play
the
eavesdropper
the
reason
of
it
would
he
always
averred
be
explained
to
you
later
on
in
your
career
the
saying
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
was
he
declared
a
most
ridiculous
aphorism
you
overhear
persons
talking
and
you
listen
very
well
it
may
chance
that
you
hear
yourself
abused
what
then
nothing
can
be
so
good
for
you
as
such
abuse
the
instruction
given
is
twofold
it
warns
you
against
foes
whom
you
have
perhaps
considered
friends
and
it
tones
down
any
overweening
conceit
you
may
have
had
concerning
your
own
importance
or
ability
listen
to
everything
if
you
are
wise
i
always
do
i
am
an
old
and
practised
listener
and
i
have
never
listened
in
vain
all
the
information
i
have
gained
through
listening
though
apparently
at
first
disconnected
and
unclassified
has
fitted
into
my
work
like
the
stray
pieces
of
a
puzzle
and
has
proved
eminently
useful
wherever
i
am
i
always
keep
my
ears
well
open
with
such
views
as
he
thus
entertained
life
was
always
enormously
interesting
to
dean
he
found
nothing
tiresome
not
even
the
conversation
of
the
type
known
as
noodle
the
noodle
was
as
curious
a
specimen
of
nature
to
him
as
the
emu
or
the
crocodile
and
as
he
turned
up
his
intellectual
little
physiognomy
to
the
deep
warm
egyptian
sky
and
inhaled
the
air
sniffingly
as
though
it
were
a
monster
just
uncorked
for
his
special
gratification
he
smiled
as
he
observed
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
standing
entirely
alone
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
attired
as
a
boulogne
and
looking
daggers
after
the
figure
of
a
white
hussar
no
other
than
ross
courtney
how
extremely
droll
a
looks
in
egypt
commented
the
doctor
to
his
inward
self
remarkable
the
incongruity
is
peculiarly
typical
of
the
chetwynd
lyles
the
costume
of
the
young
woman
is
like
the
knighthood
of
her
father
droll
droll
very
droll
aloud
he
said
why
are
you
not
dancing
miss
muriel
oh
i
do
know
i
tired
she
said
petulantly
besides
all
the
men
are
after
that
ziska
woman
they
seem
to
have
lost
their
heads
about
her
ah
and
dean
rubbed
his
hands
yes
possibly
well
she
is
certainly
very
beautiful
i
can
not
see
it
and
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
flushed
with
the
inward
rage
which
could
not
be
spoken
it
the
way
she
dresses
more
than
her
looks
nobody
knows
who
she
is
but
they
do
not
seem
to
care
about
that
they
are
all
raving
like
lunatics
over
her
and
that
man
that
artist
who
arrived
here
armand
gervase
seems
the
maddest
of
the
lot
have
you
noticed
how
often
he
has
danced
with
her
i
could
help
noticing
that
said
the
doctor
emphatically
for
i
have
never
seen
anything
more
exquisite
than
the
way
they
waltz
together
physically
they
seem
made
for
one
another
muriel
laughed
disdainfully
you
had
better
tell
denzil
murray
that
he
is
in
a
bad
enough
humor
now
and
that
remark
of
yours
would
improve
it
i
can
tell
you
she
broke
off
abruptly
as
a
slim
fair
girl
dressed
as
a
greek
vestal
in
white
with
a
chaplet
of
silver
round
her
hair
suddenly
approached
and
touched
dean
on
the
arm
can
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
she
asked
my
dear
miss
murray
of
course
and
the
doctor
turned
to
her
at
once
what
is
it
she
paced
with
him
a
few
steps
in
silence
while
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
moved
languidly
away
from
the
terrace
and
the
what
is
it
repeated
dean
you
seem
distressed
come
tell
me
all
about
it
helen
murray
lifted
her
eyes
the
soft
eyes
that
lord
fulkeward
had
said
he
admired
suffused
with
tears
and
fixed
them
on
the
old
man
face
i
wish
she
said
i
wish
we
had
never
come
to
egypt
i
feel
as
if
some
great
misfortune
were
going
to
happen
to
us
i
do
indeed
oh
dean
have
you
watched
my
brother
this
evening
i
have
he
replied
and
then
was
silent
and
what
do
you
think
she
asked
anxiously
how
can
you
account
for
his
strangeness
his
roughness
even
to
me
and
the
tears
brimmed
over
and
fell
despite
her
efforts
to
restrain
them
dean
stopped
in
his
walk
and
took
her
two
hands
in
his
own
my
dear
helen
it
no
use
worrying
yourself
like
this
he
said
nothing
can
stop
the
progress
of
the
inevitable
i
have
watched
denzil
i
have
watched
the
new
arrival
armand
gervase
i
have
watched
the
mysterious
ziska
and
i
have
watched
you
well
what
is
the
result
the
inevitable
simply
the
unconquerable
inevitable
denzil
is
in
love
gervase
is
in
love
everybody
is
in
love
except
me
and
one
other
it
is
a
whole
network
of
mischief
and
i
am
the
unhappy
fly
that
has
unconsciously
fallen
into
the
very
middle
of
it
but
the
spider
my
dear
the
spider
who
wove
the
web
in
the
first
instance
is
the
princess
ziska
and
she
is
not
in
love
she
is
the
other
one
she
is
not
in
love
with
anybody
any
more
than
i
am
she
got
something
else
on
her
mind
i
do
know
what
it
is
exactly
but
it
is
love
excluding
her
and
myself
the
whole
hotel
is
in
love
you
are
in
love
helen
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
grasp
and
a
deep
flush
reddened
her
fair
face
i
she
stammered
dean
you
are
mistaken
dean
was
never
mistaken
on
in
his
life
said
that
sage
complacently
now
my
dear
do
be
offended
i
have
known
both
you
and
your
brother
ever
since
you
were
left
little
orphan
children
together
if
i
can
not
speak
plainly
to
you
who
can
you
are
in
love
little
helen
and
very
unwisely
too
with
the
man
gervase
i
have
heard
of
him
often
but
i
never
saw
him
before
and
i
do
approve
of
him
helen
grew
as
pale
as
she
had
been
rosy
and
her
face
as
the
moonlight
fell
upon
it
was
very
sorrowful
he
stayed
with
us
in
scotland
two
summers
ago
she
said
softly
he
was
very
agreeable
ha
no
doubt
he
made
a
sort
of
love
to
you
then
i
suppose
i
can
imagine
him
doing
it
very
well
there
is
a
nice
romantic
glen
near
your
house
just
where
the
river
runs
and
where
i
caught
a
salmon
some
five
years
ago
ha
catching
salmon
is
healthy
work
much
better
than
falling
in
love
no
no
helen
gervase
is
not
good
enough
for
you
you
want
a
far
better
man
has
he
spoken
to
you
oh
yes
and
he
has
danced
with
me
ha
how
often
once
and
how
many
times
with
the
princess
ziska
helen
fair
head
drooped
and
she
answered
nothing
all
at
once
the
little
doctor
hand
closed
on
her
arm
with
a
soft
yet
firm
grip
look
he
whispered
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
two
figures
step
out
on
the
terrace
and
stand
in
the
full
moonlight
the
white
bedouin
dress
of
the
one
and
the
glittering
golden
robe
of
the
other
made
them
easily
recognizable
they
were
gervase
and
the
princess
ziska
helen
gave
a
faint
quick
sigh
let
us
go
in
she
said
nonsense
why
should
we
go
in
on
the
contrary
let
us
join
them
oh
no
and
helen
shrank
visibly
at
the
very
idea
i
can
not
do
not
ask
me
i
have
tried
you
know
i
have
tried
to
like
the
princess
but
something
in
her
i
do
know
what
it
is
repels
me
to
speak
truthfully
i
think
i
am
afraid
of
her
afraid
pooh
why
should
you
be
afraid
it
is
true
one
does
often
see
a
woman
with
the
eyes
of
a
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
i
have
dissected
the
eyes
of
a
very
interesting
work
very
the
princess
has
them
only
of
course
hers
are
larger
and
finer
but
there
is
exactly
the
same
expression
in
them
i
am
fond
of
study
you
know
i
am
studying
her
what
are
you
determined
to
run
away
i
am
engaged
for
this
dance
to
courtney
said
helen
nervously
well
well
we
resume
our
conversation
another
time
and
dean
took
her
hand
and
patted
it
pleasantly
do
fret
yourself
about
denzil
he
be
all
right
and
take
my
advice
do
marry
a
bedouin
chief
marry
an
honest
straightforward
englishman
who
take
care
of
you
not
a
nondescript
savage
who
desert
you
and
with
a
humorous
and
kindly
smile
dean
moved
off
to
join
the
two
motionless
and
picturesque
figures
that
stood
side
by
side
looking
at
the
moon
while
helen
like
a
frightened
bird
suddenly
released
fled
precipitately
back
to
the
where
ross
courtney
was
already
searching
for
her
as
his
partner
in
the
next
waltz
upon
my
word
mused
the
doctor
this
is
a
very
pretty
kettle
of
fish
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
is
not
a
hotel
at
all
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
lunatic
asylum
what
with
lady
fulkeward
getting
herself
up
as
twenty
at
the
age
of
sixty
and
muriel
and
dolly
chetwynd
lyle
with
more
ferocity
than
sportsmen
hunt
tigers
helen
in
love
denzil
in
love
gervase
in
love
dear
me
dear
me
what
a
list
of
subjects
for
a
student
consideration
and
the
princess
ziska
he
broke
off
his
meditations
abruptly
vaguely
impressed
by
the
strange
solemnity
of
the
night
an
equal
solemnity
seemed
to
surround
the
two
figures
to
which
he
now
drew
nigh
and
as
the
princess
ziska
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
as
he
came
he
was
to
his
own
vexation
aware
that
something
indefinable
disturbed
his
usual
equanimity
and
gave
him
an
unpleasant
thrill
you
are
enjoying
a
moonlight
stroll
doctor
she
inquired
her
veil
was
now
cast
aside
in
a
careless
fold
of
soft
drapery
over
her
shoulders
and
her
face
in
its
ethereal
delicacy
of
feature
and
brilliant
coloring
looked
almost
too
beautiful
to
be
human
dean
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
was
thinking
what
a
singular
resemblance
there
was
between
armand
gervase
and
one
of
the
figures
on
a
certain
egyptian
fresco
in
the
british
museum
enjoying
er
er
a
what
a
moonlight
stroll
exactly
er
yes
pardon
me
princess
my
mind
often
wanders
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
a
little
deaf
as
well
yes
i
find
the
night
singularly
conducive
to
meditation
one
can
not
be
in
a
land
like
this
under
a
sky
like
this
and
he
pointed
to
the
shining
heaven
without
recalling
the
great
histories
of
the
past
i
daresay
they
were
very
much
like
the
histories
of
the
present
said
gervase
smiling
i
should
doubt
that
history
is
what
man
makes
it
and
the
character
of
man
in
the
early
days
of
civilization
was
i
think
more
forceful
more
earnest
more
strong
of
purpose
more
bent
on
great
achievements
the
principal
achievement
and
glory
being
to
kill
as
many
of
as
possible
laughed
gervase
like
the
famous
warrior
araxes
of
whom
the
princess
has
just
been
telling
me
araxes
was
great
but
now
araxes
is
a
forgotten
hero
said
the
princess
slowly
each
accent
of
her
dulcet
voice
chiming
on
the
ear
like
the
stroke
of
a
small
silver
bell
none
of
the
modern
discoverers
know
anything
about
him
yet
they
have
not
even
found
his
tomb
but
he
was
buried
in
the
pyramids
with
all
the
honors
of
a
king
no
doubt
your
clever
men
will
excavate
him
some
day
i
think
the
pyramids
have
been
very
thoroughly
explored
said
dean
nothing
of
any
importance
remains
in
them
now
the
princess
arched
her
lovely
eyebrows
no
ah
i
daresay
you
know
them
better
than
i
do
and
she
laughed
a
laugh
which
was
not
mirthful
so
much
as
scornful
i
am
very
much
interested
in
araxes
said
gervase
then
partly
i
suppose
because
he
is
as
yet
in
the
happy
condition
of
being
an
interred
mummy
nobody
has
dug
him
up
unwound
his
cerements
or
photographed
him
and
his
ornaments
have
not
been
stolen
and
in
the
second
place
i
am
interested
in
him
because
it
appears
he
was
in
love
with
the
famous
dancer
of
his
day
whom
the
princess
represents
charmazel
i
wish
i
had
heard
the
story
before
i
came
to
cairo
i
would
have
got
myself
up
as
araxes
in
person
in
order
to
play
the
lover
of
charmazel
queried
the
doctor
exactly
replied
gervase
with
flashing
eyes
i
daresay
i
could
have
acted
the
part
i
should
imagine
you
could
act
any
part
replied
the
doctor
blandly
the
role
of
comes
easily
to
most
men
the
princess
looked
at
him
as
he
spoke
and
smiled
the
jewelled
scarab
set
as
a
brooch
on
her
bosom
flashed
luridly
in
the
moon
and
in
her
black
eyes
there
was
a
similar
lurid
gleam
come
and
talk
to
me
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
am
tired
and
the
conversation
of
one
partners
is
very
banal
monsieur
gervase
would
like
me
to
dance
all
night
i
imagine
but
i
am
too
lazy
i
leave
such
energy
to
lady
fulkeward
and
to
all
the
english
misses
and
madams
i
love
indolence
most
russian
women
do
i
think
observed
the
doctor
she
laughed
but
i
am
not
russian
i
know
i
never
thought
you
were
he
returned
composedly
but
everyone
in
the
hotel
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
are
they
are
all
wrong
what
can
i
do
to
put
them
right
she
inquired
with
a
fascinating
little
upward
movement
of
her
eyebrows
nothing
leave
them
in
their
ignorance
i
shall
not
enlighten
them
though
i
know
your
nationality
you
do
and
a
curious
shadow
darkened
her
features
but
perhaps
you
are
wrong
also
i
think
not
said
the
doctor
with
gentle
obstinacy
you
are
an
egyptian
born
in
egypt
born
of
egypt
pure
eastern
there
is
nothing
western
about
you
is
not
it
so
she
looked
at
him
enigmatically
you
have
made
a
near
guess
she
replied
but
you
are
not
absolutely
correct
originally
i
am
of
egypt
dean
nodded
pleasantly
originally
yes
that
is
precisely
what
i
mean
originally
let
me
take
you
in
to
supper
he
offered
his
arm
but
gervase
made
a
hasty
step
forward
princess
he
began
she
waved
him
off
lightly
my
dear
monsieur
gervase
we
are
not
in
the
desert
where
bedouin
chiefs
do
just
as
they
like
we
are
in
a
modern
hotel
in
cairo
and
all
the
good
english
mammas
will
be
dreadfully
shocked
if
i
am
seen
too
much
with
you
i
have
danced
with
you
five
times
remember
and
i
will
dance
with
you
once
more
before
i
leave
when
our
waltz
begins
come
and
find
me
in
the
she
moved
away
on
dean
arm
and
gervase
moodily
drew
back
and
let
her
pass
when
she
had
gone
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
walked
impatiently
up
and
down
the
terrace
a
heavy
frown
wrinkling
his
brows
the
shadow
of
a
man
suddenly
darkened
the
moonlight
in
front
of
him
and
denzil
murray
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
gervase
he
said
huskily
i
must
speak
to
you
gervase
glanced
him
up
and
down
taking
note
of
his
pale
face
and
wild
eyes
with
a
certain
regret
and
compassion
say
on
my
friend
denzil
looked
straight
at
him
biting
his
lips
hard
and
clenching
his
hands
in
the
effort
to
keep
down
some
evidently
violent
emotion
the
princess
ziska
he
began
gervase
smiled
and
flicked
the
ash
off
his
cigarette
the
princess
ziska
he
echoed
yes
what
of
her
she
seems
to
be
the
only
person
talked
about
in
cairo
everybody
in
this
hotel
at
any
rate
begins
conversation
with
precisely
the
same
words
as
you
do
princess
ziska
upon
my
life
it
is
very
amusing
it
is
not
amusing
to
me
said
denzil
bitterly
to
me
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
he
paused
and
gervase
looked
at
him
curiously
we
always
been
such
good
friends
gervase
he
continued
that
i
should
be
sorry
if
anything
came
between
us
now
so
i
think
it
is
better
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
speak
out
plainly
again
he
hesitated
his
face
growing
still
paler
then
with
a
sudden
ardent
light
glowing
in
his
eyes
he
said
gervase
i
love
the
princess
ziska
gervase
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
laughed
aloud
with
a
wild
hilarity
my
good
boy
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
sorry
too
for
myself
i
deplore
the
position
in
which
we
are
placed
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
it
is
unfortunate
but
it
seems
inevitable
you
love
the
princess
ziska
and
by
all
the
gods
of
egypt
and
christendom
so
do
i
chapter
iv
denzil
recoiled
a
step
backward
then
with
an
impulsive
movement
strode
close
up
to
him
his
face
unnaturally
flushed
and
his
eyes
glittering
with
an
evil
fire
you
you
love
her
what
in
one
short
hour
you
who
have
often
boasted
to
me
of
having
no
heart
no
eyes
for
women
except
as
models
for
your
canvas
you
say
now
that
you
love
a
woman
whom
you
have
never
seen
before
stop
returned
gervase
somewhat
moodily
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that
i
have
seen
her
before
though
where
i
can
not
tell
but
the
fire
that
stirs
my
pulses
now
seems
to
spring
from
some
old
passion
suddenly
revived
and
the
eyes
of
the
woman
we
are
both
mad
for
well
they
do
not
inspire
holiness
my
dear
friend
no
neither
in
you
nor
in
me
let
us
be
honest
with
each
other
there
is
something
vile
in
the
composition
of
madame
la
princesse
and
it
responds
to
something
equally
vile
in
ourselves
we
shall
be
dragged
down
by
the
force
of
it
tant
pis
pour
nous
i
am
sorrier
for
you
than
for
myself
for
you
are
a
good
fellow
au
fond
you
have
what
the
world
is
learning
to
despise
sentiment
i
have
none
for
as
i
told
you
before
i
have
no
heart
but
i
have
passions
tigerish
ones
which
must
be
humored
in
fact
i
make
it
my
business
in
life
to
humor
them
do
you
intend
to
humor
them
in
this
instance
assuredly
if
i
can
then
friend
as
you
have
been
you
can
be
friend
no
more
said
denzil
fiercely
my
god
do
you
not
understand
my
blood
is
as
warm
as
yours
i
will
not
yield
to
you
one
smile
one
look
from
ziska
no
i
will
kill
you
first
gervase
looked
at
him
calmly
will
you
pauvre
garcon
you
are
such
a
boy
still
denzil
how
old
are
you
ah
i
remember
now
only
and
i
am
so
in
the
measure
of
time
alone
your
life
is
more
valuable
to
you
than
mine
is
to
me
if
you
choose
therefore
you
can
kill
me
now
if
you
like
i
have
a
very
convenient
dagger
in
my
belt
i
think
it
has
a
point
which
you
are
welcome
to
use
for
the
purpose
but
for
heaven
sake
do
rant
about
it
do
it
you
can
kill
me
of
course
you
can
but
you
can
not
mark
this
well
denzil
you
can
not
prevent
my
loving
the
same
woman
whom
you
love
i
think
instead
of
raving
about
the
matter
here
in
the
moonlight
which
has
the
effect
of
making
us
look
like
two
orthodox
villains
in
a
set
we
better
make
the
best
of
it
and
resolve
to
abide
by
the
lady
choice
in
the
matter
what
say
you
you
have
known
her
for
many
days
i
have
known
her
for
two
hours
you
have
had
the
first
innings
so
you
can
not
complain
here
he
playfully
unfastened
the
bedouin
knife
which
hung
at
his
belt
and
offered
it
to
denzil
holding
it
delicately
by
the
glittering
blade
one
thrust
my
brave
boy
he
said
and
you
will
stop
the
ziska
fever
in
my
veins
at
once
and
forever
but
unless
you
deal
the
blow
the
fever
will
go
on
increasing
till
it
reaches
its
extremest
height
and
then
and
then
echoed
denzil
then
oh
god
only
knows
what
then
denzil
thrust
away
the
offered
weapon
with
a
movement
of
aversion
you
can
jest
he
said
you
are
always
jesting
but
you
do
not
know
you
can
not
read
the
horrible
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
can
not
resolve
their
meaning
even
to
myself
there
is
some
truth
in
your
light
words
i
feel
i
know
instinctively
that
the
woman
i
love
has
an
attraction
about
her
which
is
not
good
but
evil
yet
what
does
that
matter
do
not
men
sometimes
love
vile
women
always
replied
gervase
briefly
gervase
i
have
suffered
tortures
ever
since
i
saw
her
face
exclaimed
the
unhappy
lad
his
suddenly
giving
way
you
can
not
imagine
what
my
life
has
been
her
eyes
make
me
mad
the
merest
touch
of
her
hand
seems
to
drag
me
away
invisibly
to
perdition
finished
gervase
that
is
the
usual
end
of
the
journey
we
men
take
with
beautiful
women
and
now
went
on
denzil
hardly
heeding
him
as
if
my
own
despair
were
not
sufficient
you
must
needs
add
to
it
what
evil
fate
i
wonder
sent
you
to
cairo
of
course
i
have
no
chance
with
her
now
you
are
sure
to
win
the
day
and
can
you
wonder
then
that
i
feel
as
if
i
could
kill
you
oh
i
wonder
at
nothing
said
gervase
calmly
except
perhaps
at
myself
and
i
echo
your
words
most
feelingly
what
evil
fate
sent
me
to
cairo
i
can
not
tell
but
here
i
purpose
to
remain
my
dear
murray
do
let
us
quarrel
if
we
can
help
it
it
is
such
a
waste
of
time
i
am
not
angry
with
you
for
loving
la
belle
ziska
try
therefore
not
to
be
angry
with
me
let
the
fair
one
herself
decide
as
to
our
merits
my
own
opinion
is
that
she
cares
for
neither
of
us
and
moreover
that
she
never
will
care
for
any
one
except
her
fascinating
self
and
certainly
her
charms
are
quite
enough
to
engross
her
whole
attention
by
the
way
let
me
ask
you
denzil
in
this
headstrong
passion
of
yours
for
it
is
a
headstrong
passion
just
as
mine
is
do
you
actually
intend
to
make
the
ziska
your
wife
if
she
will
have
you
of
course
replied
murray
with
some
haughtiness
a
fleeting
expression
of
amusement
flitted
over
gervase
features
it
is
very
honorable
of
you
he
said
very
my
dear
boy
you
shall
have
your
full
chance
because
i
i
would
not
make
the
princess
madame
gervase
for
all
the
world
she
is
not
formed
for
a
life
of
domesticity
and
pardon
me
i
can
not
picture
her
as
the
contented
chatelaine
of
your
grand
old
scotch
castle
in
why
not
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
the
idea
is
incongruous
said
gervase
lazily
nevertheless
i
will
not
interfere
with
your
wooing
denzil
face
brightened
you
will
not
i
will
not
i
promise
but
and
here
gervase
paused
looking
his
young
friend
full
in
the
eyes
remember
if
your
chance
falls
to
the
ground
if
madame
gives
you
your
conge
if
she
does
not
consent
to
be
a
scottish
chatelaine
and
listen
every
day
to
the
bagpipes
at
dinner
you
can
not
expect
me
then
to
be
indifferent
to
my
own
desires
she
shall
not
be
madame
gervase
oh
no
she
shall
not
be
asked
to
attend
to
the
she
shall
act
the
role
for
which
she
has
dressed
she
shall
be
another
charmazel
to
another
araxes
though
the
wild
days
of
egypt
are
no
more
a
sudden
shiver
ran
through
him
as
he
spoke
and
instinctively
he
drew
the
white
folds
of
his
picturesque
garb
closer
about
him
there
is
a
chill
wind
sweeping
in
from
the
desert
he
said
an
evil
sandy
breath
tasting
of
blown
through
the
crevices
of
the
tombs
of
kings
let
us
go
in
murray
looked
at
him
in
a
kind
of
dull
despair
and
what
is
to
be
done
he
asked
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
and
from
what
you
say
neither
can
you
my
dear
friend
or
foe
whichever
you
determine
to
be
i
can
answer
for
myself
in
one
particular
at
any
rate
namely
that
as
i
told
you
i
shall
not
ask
the
princess
to
marry
me
you
on
the
contrary
will
do
so
bonne
chance
i
shall
do
nothing
to
prevent
madame
from
accepting
the
honorable
position
you
intend
to
offer
her
and
till
the
fiat
has
gone
forth
and
the
fair
one
has
decided
we
will
not
fly
at
each
other
throats
like
wolves
disputing
possession
of
a
lamb
we
will
assume
composure
even
if
we
have
it
not
he
paused
and
laid
one
hand
kindly
on
the
younger
man
shoulder
is
it
agreed
denzil
gave
a
mute
sign
of
resigned
acquiescence
good
i
like
you
denzil
you
are
a
charming
boy
and
a
trifle
melodramatic
in
your
loves
and
hatreds
yes
for
that
you
might
have
been
a
provencal
instead
of
a
scot
before
i
knew
you
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
all
scotchmen
were
or
needs
must
be
ridiculous
i
do
know
why
i
associated
them
with
bagpipes
short
petticoats
and
whisky
i
had
no
idea
of
the
type
you
so
well
represent
the
dark
fine
eyes
the
strong
physique
and
the
impetuous
disposition
which
suggests
the
south
rather
than
the
north
and
you
look
so
unlike
the
accepted
cafe
chantant
picture
of
the
highlander
that
you
might
in
very
truth
be
a
florentine
in
more
points
than
the
dress
which
so
well
becomes
you
yes
i
like
you
and
more
than
you
i
like
your
sister
that
is
why
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
you
i
would
grieve
mademoiselle
helen
for
the
world
murray
gave
him
a
quick
you
are
a
strange
fellow
gervase
two
summers
ago
you
were
almost
in
love
with
helen
gervase
sighed
true
almost
that
just
it
is
a
very
uncomfortable
word
i
have
been
almost
in
love
so
many
times
i
have
never
been
drawn
by
a
woman
eyes
and
dragged
down
down
in
a
mad
whirlpool
of
sweetness
and
poison
intermixed
i
have
never
had
my
soul
strangled
by
the
coils
of
a
woman
hair
black
hair
black
as
night
in
the
perfumed
meshes
of
which
a
jewelled
serpent
gleams
i
have
never
felt
the
insidious
horror
of
a
love
like
strong
drink
mounting
through
the
blood
to
the
brain
and
there
making
inextricable
confusion
of
time
space
eternity
everything
except
the
passion
itself
never
never
have
i
felt
all
this
denzil
till
bah
it
is
a
wild
night
of
dancing
and
folly
and
the
princess
ziska
is
to
blame
for
it
all
do
look
so
tragic
my
good
denzil
what
ails
you
now
what
ails
me
good
heavens
can
you
ask
it
and
murray
gave
a
gesture
of
mingled
despair
and
impatience
if
you
love
her
in
this
wild
uncontrolled
way
it
is
the
only
way
i
know
of
said
gervase
love
must
be
wild
and
uncontrolled
to
save
it
from
banalite
it
must
be
a
summer
thunderstorm
the
heavy
brooding
of
the
clouds
of
thought
the
lightning
of
desire
then
the
crash
the
downpour
and
the
end
in
which
the
bland
sun
smiles
upon
a
bland
world
of
dull
but
wholesome
routine
and
tame
conventionality
making
believe
that
there
never
was
such
a
thing
known
as
the
past
storm
be
consoled
denzil
and
trust
me
you
shall
have
time
to
make
your
honorable
proposal
and
madame
had
better
accept
you
for
your
love
would
last
mine
could
not
he
spoke
with
a
strange
fierceness
and
irritability
and
his
eyes
were
darkened
by
a
sudden
shadow
of
melancholy
denzil
bewildered
at
his
words
and
manner
stared
at
him
in
a
kind
of
helpless
indignation
then
you
admit
yourself
to
be
cruel
and
unprincipled
he
said
gervase
smiled
with
a
little
shrug
of
impatience
do
i
i
was
not
aware
of
it
is
inconstancy
to
women
cruelty
and
want
of
principle
if
so
all
men
must
bear
the
brunt
of
the
accusation
with
me
for
men
were
originally
barbarians
and
always
looked
upon
women
as
toys
or
slaves
the
barbaric
taint
is
not
out
of
us
yet
i
assure
you
at
any
rate
it
is
not
out
of
me
i
am
a
pure
savage
i
consider
the
love
of
woman
as
my
right
if
i
win
it
i
enjoy
it
as
long
as
i
please
but
no
longer
and
not
all
the
forces
of
heaven
and
earth
should
bind
me
to
any
woman
i
had
once
grown
weary
of
if
that
is
your
character
said
murray
stiffly
it
were
well
the
princess
ziska
should
know
it
true
and
gervase
laughed
loudly
tell
her
man
ami
tell
her
that
armand
gervase
is
an
unprincipled
villain
not
worth
a
glance
from
her
dazzling
eyes
it
will
be
the
way
to
make
her
adore
me
my
good
boy
do
you
not
know
that
there
is
something
very
marvellous
in
the
attraction
we
call
love
it
is
a
destiny
and
if
one
soul
is
so
constituted
that
it
must
meet
and
mix
with
another
nothing
can
hinder
the
operation
so
that
believe
me
i
am
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
you
say
of
me
to
madame
la
princesse
or
to
anyone
else
it
will
not
be
for
either
my
looks
or
my
character
that
she
will
love
me
if
indeed
she
ever
does
love
me
it
will
be
for
something
indistinct
indefinable
but
resistless
in
us
both
which
no
one
on
earth
can
explain
and
now
i
must
go
denzil
and
claim
the
fair
one
for
this
waltz
try
and
look
less
miserable
my
dear
fellow
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
on
the
princess
account
nor
on
any
other
pretext
if
i
can
help
it
for
i
do
want
to
kill
you
and
i
am
convinced
your
death
and
not
mine
would
be
the
result
of
a
fight
between
us
his
eyes
flashed
under
his
straight
fierce
brows
with
a
sudden
touch
of
imperiousness
and
his
commanding
presence
became
magnetic
almost
tormented
with
a
dozen
of
feeling
young
denzil
murray
was
mute
only
his
breath
came
and
went
quickly
and
there
was
a
certain
antagonism
in
his
very
attitude
gervase
saw
it
and
smiled
then
turning
away
with
his
peculiarly
noiseless
step
and
grace
of
bearing
he
disappeared
chapter
ten
minutes
later
the
larger
number
of
dancers
in
the
came
to
a
sudden
pause
in
their
gyrations
and
stood
looking
on
in
wonderment
at
the
exquisite
waltz
movements
of
the
princess
ziska
as
she
floated
past
them
in
the
arms
of
gervase
who
as
a
bedouin
chief
was
perhaps
only
acting
his
part
aright
when
he
held
her
to
him
with
so
passionate
and
close
a
grip
and
gazed
down
upon
her
fair
face
with
such
a
burning
ardor
in
his
eyes
nothing
in
the
dancing
world
was
ever
seen
like
the
dancing
of
these
two
nothing
so
languorously
beautiful
as
the
swaying
grace
of
their
figures
gliding
to
the
music
in
as
perfectly
harmonious
a
measure
as
a
bird
two
wings
beat
to
the
pulsations
of
the
air
people
noticed
that
as
the
princess
danced
a
tiny
tinkling
sound
accompanied
her
every
step
and
the
more
curious
observers
peeping
downwards
as
she
flew
by
saw
that
she
had
kept
to
the
details
of
ancient
egyptian
costume
so
exactly
that
she
even
wore
sandals
and
that
her
feet
perfectly
shaped
and
lovely
as
perfectly
shaped
and
lovely
hands
were
bare
save
for
the
which
crossed
them
and
which
were
fastened
with
jewels
round
the
slim
ankles
were
light
bands
of
gold
also
glittering
with
gems
and
furthermore
adorned
by
little
golden
bells
which
produced
the
pretty
tinkling
music
that
attracted
attention
what
a
delightful
creature
she
is
said
lady
fulkeward
settling
her
duchess
of
gainsborough
hat
on
her
powdered
wig
more
becomingly
and
smiling
up
in
the
face
of
ross
courtney
who
happened
to
be
standing
close
by
so
sweetly
unconventional
everybody
here
thinks
her
improper
she
may
be
but
i
like
her
i
not
a
bit
of
a
prude
courtney
smiled
irreverently
at
this
prudery
and
old
lady
fulkeward
were
indeed
wide
apart
aloud
he
said
i
think
whenever
a
woman
is
exceptionally
beautiful
she
generally
gets
reported
as
by
her
own
sex
especially
if
she
has
a
fascinating
manner
and
dresses
well
so
true
and
lady
fulkeward
simpered
exactly
what
i
find
wherever
i
go
poor
dear
ziska
she
has
to
pay
the
penalty
for
captivating
all
you
men
in
the
way
she
does
i
sure
you
have
lost
your
heart
to
her
quite
as
much
as
anybody
else
have
you
courtney
reddened
i
do
think
so
he
answered
i
admire
her
very
much
but
i
lost
my
heart
naughty
boy
do
prevaricate
and
lady
fulkeward
smiled
in
the
bewitching
pearly
manner
her
artificial
teeth
allowed
her
to
do
every
man
in
the
hotel
is
in
love
with
the
princess
and
i
sure
i
do
blame
them
if
i
belonged
to
your
sex
i
should
be
in
love
with
her
too
as
it
is
i
am
in
love
with
the
new
arrival
that
glorious
creature
gervase
he
is
superb
he
looks
like
an
untamed
savage
i
adore
handsome
barbarians
he
scarcely
a
barbarian
i
think
said
courtney
with
some
amusement
he
is
the
great
french
artist
the
of
paris
just
now
only
secondary
to
sarah
bernhardt
artists
are
always
barbarians
declared
lady
fulkeward
enthusiastically
they
paint
naughty
people
without
any
clothes
on
they
never
have
any
idea
of
time
they
never
keep
their
appointments
and
they
are
always
falling
in
love
with
the
wrong
person
and
getting
into
trouble
which
is
so
nice
of
them
that
why
i
worship
them
all
they
are
so
refreshingly
unlike
our
set
courtney
raised
his
eyebrows
inquiringly
you
know
what
i
mean
by
our
set
went
on
the
vivacious
old
gainsborough
the
aristocrats
whose
conversation
is
limited
to
the
weather
and
scandal
and
who
are
so
frightfully
dull
dull
my
dear
ross
you
know
how
dull
they
are
well
upon
my
word
they
are
admitted
courtney
you
are
right
there
i
certainly
agree
with
you
i
sure
you
do
they
have
no
ideas
now
artists
have
ideas
they
live
on
ideas
and
sentiment
sentiment
is
such
a
beautiful
thing
so
charming
i
believe
that
gervase
is
a
creature
of
sentiment
and
how
delightful
that
is
of
course
he
paint
the
princess
ziska
he
must
paint
her
no
one
else
could
do
it
so
well
by
the
way
have
you
been
asked
to
her
great
party
next
week
yes
and
are
you
going
most
assuredly
so
am
i
that
absurd
chetwynd
lyle
woman
came
to
me
this
evening
and
asked
me
if
i
really
thought
it
would
be
proper
to
take
her
there
and
lady
fulkeward
laughed
shrilly
girls
indeed
i
should
say
those
two
long
ugly
women
could
go
anywhere
with
safety
you
consider
the
princess
a
proper
woman
she
asked
and
i
said
as
proper
as
you
are
courtney
laughed
outright
and
began
to
think
there
was
some
fun
in
lady
fulkeward
by
jove
did
you
tell
her
that
i
should
think
i
did
oh
i
know
a
thing
or
two
about
the
chetwynd
lyles
but
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
till
it
suits
me
to
open
it
i
said
i
was
going
and
then
of
course
she
said
she
would
naturally
and
courtney
gave
the
answer
vaguely
for
the
waltz
was
ended
and
the
princess
ziska
on
the
arm
of
gervase
was
leaving
the
she
going
exclaimed
lady
fulkeward
dear
creature
excuse
me
i
must
speak
to
her
for
a
moment
and
with
a
swish
of
her
full
skirts
and
a
toss
of
her
huge
hat
and
feathers
the
lively
flirt
of
sixty
tripped
off
with
all
the
agility
of
sixteen
leaving
courtney
to
follow
her
or
remain
where
he
was
just
as
he
chose
he
hesitated
and
during
that
undecided
pause
was
joined
by
maxwell
dean
a
very
brilliant
and
interesting
evening
said
that
individual
smiling
complacently
i
do
remember
any
time
when
i
have
enjoyed
myself
so
thoroughly
really
i
should
have
thought
you
a
man
to
care
for
balls
said
courtney
should
you
ha
well
some
balls
i
might
not
care
for
but
this
one
has
been
highly
productive
of
entertainment
in
every
way
and
several
incidents
connected
with
it
have
opened
up
to
me
a
new
vista
of
research
the
possibilities
of
which
are
er
very
interesting
and
remarkable
indeed
murmured
courtney
indifferently
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
slim
supple
figure
of
the
princess
ziska
as
she
slowly
moved
amid
her
circle
of
admirers
out
of
the
her
golden
skirts
gleaming
against
the
polished
floor
and
the
jewels
about
her
flashing
in
vivid
points
of
light
from
the
hem
of
her
robe
to
the
snake
in
her
hair
yes
continued
the
doctor
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
i
think
i
have
got
the
clue
to
a
very
interesting
problem
but
i
see
you
are
absorbed
and
no
wonder
a
charming
woman
the
princess
ziska
charming
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
this
question
was
put
with
such
unexpected
abruptness
that
courtney
was
quite
taken
aback
ghosts
he
echoed
no
i
can
not
say
i
do
i
have
never
seen
one
and
i
have
never
heard
of
one
that
did
not
turn
out
a
bogus
oh
i
do
mean
the
usual
sort
of
ghost
said
the
doctor
drawing
his
shelving
brows
together
in
a
meditative
knot
of
lines
over
his
small
speculative
eyes
the
ghost
that
is
common
to
scotch
castles
and
english
and
that
appears
in
an
orthodox
sighs
screams
rattles
chains
and
bangs
doors
ad
libitum
no
no
that
kind
of
ghost
is
composed
of
indigestion
aided
by
rats
and
a
gust
of
wind
no
when
i
say
ghosts
i
mean
ghosts
ghosts
that
do
not
need
the
midnight
hour
to
evolve
themselves
into
being
and
that
by
no
means
vanish
at
my
ghosts
are
those
that
move
about
among
us
in
social
intercourse
for
days
months
sometimes
years
according
to
their
several
missions
ghosts
that
talk
to
us
imitate
our
customs
and
ways
shake
hands
with
us
laugh
and
dance
with
us
and
altogether
comport
themselves
like
human
beings
those
are
my
kind
of
ghosts
ghosts
there
are
hundreds
aye
perhaps
thousands
of
them
in
the
world
at
this
very
moment
an
uncomfortable
shudder
ran
through
courtney
veins
the
manner
seemed
peculiar
and
uncanny
by
jove
i
hope
not
he
involuntarily
exclaimed
the
orthodox
ghost
is
an
infinitely
better
arrangement
one
at
least
knows
what
to
expect
but
a
ghost
that
moves
about
in
society
resembling
ourselves
in
every
respect
appearing
to
be
actually
human
and
yet
having
no
humanity
at
all
in
its
composition
is
a
terrific
notion
indeed
you
do
mean
to
say
you
believe
in
the
possibility
of
such
an
appalling
creature
i
not
only
believe
it
answered
the
doctor
composedly
i
know
it
here
the
band
crashed
out
god
save
the
queen
which
as
a
witty
italian
once
remarked
is
the
de
profundis
of
every
english
festivity
but
god
bless
my
soul
began
courtney
no
do
say
that
urged
the
doctor
say
save
the
queen
more
british
bother
save
the
queen
exclaimed
courtney
look
here
you
do
mean
it
seriously
do
you
i
always
mean
everything
seriously
said
dean
even
my
jokes
now
come
no
nonsense
doctor
and
courtney
taking
his
arm
led
him
towards
one
of
the
windows
opening
out
to
the
moonlit
garden
can
you
as
an
honest
man
assure
me
in
sober
earnest
that
there
are
ghosts
of
the
nature
you
describe
the
little
doctor
surveyed
the
scenery
glanced
up
at
the
moon
and
then
at
his
companion
pleasant
but
not
very
intelligent
face
i
would
rather
not
discuss
the
matter
he
said
at
last
with
some
brusqueness
there
are
certain
subjects
connected
with
psychic
phenomena
on
which
it
is
best
to
be
silent
besides
what
interest
can
such
things
have
for
you
you
are
a
sportsman
keep
to
your
big
game
and
leave
to
me
that
is
not
a
fair
answer
to
my
question
said
courtney
i
sure
i
do
want
to
interfere
with
your
researches
in
any
way
i
only
want
to
know
if
it
is
a
fact
that
ghosts
exist
and
that
they
are
really
of
such
a
nature
as
to
deserve
the
term
dean
was
silent
a
moment
then
stretching
out
his
small
thin
hand
he
pointed
to
the
clear
sky
where
the
stars
were
almost
lost
to
sight
in
the
brilliance
of
the
moon
look
out
there
he
said
his
voice
thrilling
with
sudden
and
solemn
fervor
there
in
the
limitless
ether
move
millions
of
universes
vast
creations
which
our
finite
brains
can
not
estimate
without
reeling
enormous
forces
always
at
work
in
the
mighty
movements
of
which
our
earth
is
nothing
more
than
a
grain
of
sand
yet
far
more
marvellous
than
their
size
or
number
is
the
mathematical
exactitude
of
their
proportions
the
minute
perfection
of
their
balance
the
exquisite
precision
with
which
every
one
part
is
fitted
to
another
part
not
a
pin
point
awry
not
a
hair
breadth
astray
well
the
same
exactitude
which
rules
the
formation
and
working
of
matter
controls
the
formation
and
working
of
spirit
and
this
is
why
i
know
that
ghosts
exist
and
moreover
that
we
are
compelled
by
the
laws
of
the
phenomena
surrounding
us
to
meet
them
every
day
i
confess
i
do
not
follow
you
at
all
said
courtney
bewildered
no
and
dean
smiled
curiously
i
have
perhaps
expressed
myself
obscurely
yet
i
am
generally
considered
a
clear
exponent
first
of
all
let
me
ask
you
do
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
matter
why
of
course
you
do
then
you
will
no
doubt
admit
that
there
is
something
an
intelligent
principle
or
spiritual
force
which
creates
and
controls
this
matter
courtney
hesitated
well
i
suppose
there
must
be
he
said
at
last
i
not
a
and
i
rather
a
but
i
certainly
believe
there
is
a
mind
at
work
behind
the
matter
that
being
the
case
proceeded
the
doctor
i
suppose
you
will
not
deny
to
this
invisible
mind
the
same
exactitude
of
proportion
and
precise
method
of
action
already
granted
to
visible
matter
of
course
i
could
not
deny
such
a
reasonable
proposition
said
courtney
very
good
pursuing
the
argument
logically
and
allowing
for
an
mind
behind
matter
it
follows
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
injustice
anywhere
in
the
universe
my
dear
socrates
redivivus
laughed
courtney
i
fail
to
see
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
ghosts
it
has
everything
to
do
with
them
declared
the
doctor
emphatically
i
repeat
that
if
we
grant
these
already
stated
premises
concerning
the
composition
of
mind
and
matter
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
injustice
yet
seemingly
unjust
things
are
done
every
day
and
seemingly
go
unpunished
i
say
advisedly
because
the
punishment
is
always
administered
and
here
the
come
in
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
the
ghosts
i
speak
of
are
the
lord
way
of
doing
it
you
mean
began
courtney
i
mean
continued
the
doctor
with
some
excitement
that
the
sinner
who
imagines
his
sins
are
undiscovered
is
a
fool
who
deceives
himself
i
mean
that
the
murderer
who
has
secretly
torn
the
life
out
of
his
shrieking
victim
in
some
unfrequented
spot
and
has
succeeded
in
hiding
his
crime
from
what
we
call
can
not
escape
the
spiritual
law
of
vengeance
what
would
you
say
and
dean
laid
his
thin
fingers
on
courtney
with
a
light
pressure
if
i
told
you
that
the
soul
of
a
murdered
creature
is
often
sent
back
to
earth
in
human
shape
to
dog
its
murderer
down
and
that
many
a
criminal
undiscovered
by
the
police
is
haunted
by
a
seeming
person
a
man
or
a
woman
who
is
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
him
who
eats
at
his
table
drinks
his
wine
clasps
his
hand
smiles
in
his
face
and
yet
is
truly
nothing
but
the
ghost
of
his
victim
in
human
disguise
sent
to
drag
him
gradually
to
his
miserable
end
what
would
you
say
to
such
a
thing
horrible
exclaimed
courtney
recoiling
beyond
everything
monstrous
and
horrible
the
doctor
smiled
and
withdrew
his
hand
from
his
companion
arm
there
are
a
great
many
horrible
things
in
the
universe
as
well
as
pleasant
ones
he
observed
dryly
crime
and
its
results
are
always
of
a
disagreeable
nature
but
we
can
not
alter
the
psychic
law
of
equity
any
more
than
we
can
alter
the
material
law
of
gravitation
it
is
growing
late
i
think
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
go
to
bed
courtney
look
at
him
puzzled
and
baffled
then
your
ghosts
are
positive
realities
he
began
here
he
gave
a
violent
start
as
a
tall
white
figure
suddenly
moved
out
of
the
shadows
in
the
garden
and
came
slowly
towards
them
upon
my
life
doctor
you
have
made
me
quite
nervous
no
no
surely
not
smiled
the
doctor
pleasantly
not
nervous
not
such
a
brave
killer
of
game
as
you
are
no
no
you
do
take
monsieur
armand
gervase
for
a
ghost
do
you
he
is
too
substantial
far
too
substantial
ha
ha
ha
and
he
laughed
quietly
the
wrinkled
smile
still
remaining
on
his
face
as
gervase
approached
everybody
is
going
to
bed
said
the
great
artist
lazily
with
the
departure
of
the
princess
ziska
the
pleasures
of
the
evening
are
ended
she
is
certainly
the
belle
of
cairo
this
season
said
courtney
but
i
tell
you
what
i
am
rather
sorry
to
see
young
murray
has
lost
his
head
about
her
parbleu
so
am
i
said
gervase
imperturbably
it
seems
a
pity
he
will
get
over
it
interposed
dean
placidly
it
an
illness
like
typhoid
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
keep
down
the
temperature
of
the
patient
and
we
shall
pull
him
through
keep
him
cool
in
short
laughed
gervase
exactly
the
little
doctor
smiled
shrewdly
you
look
feverish
monsieur
gervase
gervase
flushed
red
under
his
dark
skin
i
daresay
i
am
feverish
he
replied
irritably
i
find
this
place
hot
as
an
oven
i
think
i
should
go
away
if
i
had
not
asked
the
princess
ziska
to
sit
to
me
you
are
going
to
paint
her
picture
exclaimed
courtney
by
jove
i
congratulate
you
it
will
be
the
masterpiece
of
the
next
salon
gervase
bowed
you
flatter
me
the
princess
is
undoubtedly
an
attractive
subject
but
as
i
said
before
this
place
stifles
me
i
think
the
hotel
is
too
near
the
river
there
is
an
oozy
smell
from
the
nile
that
i
hate
and
the
heat
is
perfectly
sulphureous
do
you
find
it
so
doctor
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
let
me
feel
your
pulse
i
am
not
a
medical
man
but
i
can
easily
recognize
any
premonitions
of
illness
gervase
held
out
his
long
brown
hand
and
the
small
cool
fingers
pressed
lightly
on
his
wrist
you
are
quite
well
monsieur
gervase
he
said
after
a
pause
you
have
a
little
of
the
nerves
certainly
but
it
is
not
curable
by
medicine
he
dropped
the
hand
he
held
and
looked
up
responded
gervase
added
courtney
and
with
an
amiable
salutation
the
doctor
went
his
way
the
was
now
quite
deserted
and
the
hotel
servants
were
extinguishing
the
lights
a
curious
little
man
that
doctor
observed
gervase
addressing
courtney
to
whom
as
yet
he
had
not
been
formally
introduced
very
curious
was
the
reply
i
have
known
him
for
some
years
he
is
a
very
clever
man
but
i
have
never
been
able
quite
to
make
him
out
i
think
he
is
a
bit
eccentric
he
just
been
telling
me
he
believes
in
ghosts
ah
poor
fellow
and
gervase
yawned
as
with
his
companion
he
crossed
the
deserted
then
he
has
what
you
call
a
screw
loose
i
suppose
it
is
that
which
makes
him
interesting
and
separating
they
went
their
several
ways
to
the
small
bedrooms
which
are
the
prime
discomfort
of
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
and
soon
a
great
silence
reigned
throughout
the
building
all
cairo
slept
save
where
at
an
open
lattice
window
the
moon
shone
full
on
a
face
to
her
silver
radiance
the
white
watchful
face
and
dark
sleepless
eyes
of
the
princess
ziska
chapter

next
day
the
ordinary
course
of
things
was
resumed
at

and
the
delights
and
flirtations
of

began
to
vanish
into
what
hans

men
were
lazier
than
usual
and
came
down
later
to
breakfast
and
girls
looked
worn
and
haggard
with
dancing
but
otherwise
there
was
no
sign
to
indicate
that
the
festivity
of
the
past
evening
had
left
tracks
behind
or
made
a
lasting
impression
of
importance

lady

portly
and
sat
on
the
terrace
working
at
an
elaborate
piece
of
talking
scandal
in
the
civilest
tone
imaginable
and
damning
all
her
dear
friends
with
that
peculiar
air
of
entire
politeness
and
good
breeding
which
distinguishes
certain
ladies
when
they
are
saying
nasty
things
about
one
another
her
daughters
muriel
and
dolly
sat
dutifully
near
her
one
reading
the
daily
dial
as
befitted
the
offspring
of
the
editor
and
proprietor
thereof
the
other
knitting
lord
fulkeward
lounged
on
the
balustrade
close
by
and
his
lovely
mother
attired
in
quite
a
charming
and
girlish
costume
of
white
foulard
exquisitely
cut
and
fitting
into
a
waist
not
measuring
more
than
inches
reclined
in
a
long
looking
the
very
pink
of
painted
and
powdered
perfection
you
are
so
very
lenient
lady
chetwynd
lyle
was
saying
as
she
bent
over
her
needlework
so
very
lenient
my
dear
lady
fulkeward
that
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
read
people
characters
as
correctly
as
i
do
i
have
had
owing
to
my
husband
position
in
journalism
a
great
deal
of
social
experience
and
i
assure
you
i
do
not
think
the
princess
ziska
a
safe
person
she
may
be
perfectly
proper
she
may
be
but
she
is
not
the
style
we
are
accustomed
to
in
london
i
should
rather
think
not
interrupted
lord
fulkeward
hastily
by
jove
she
would
have
a
hair
left
on
her
head
in
london
know
what
do
you
mean
inquired
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
simpering
you
really
do
say
such
funny
things
lord
fulkeward
do
i
and
the
young
nobleman
was
so
alarmed
and
embarrassed
at
the
very
idea
of
his
ever
saying
funny
things
that
he
was
rendered
quite
speechless
for
a
moment
anon
he
took
heart
and
resumed
er
well
i
mean
that
the
society
women
would
tear
her
to
bits
in
no
time
get
asked
nowhere
but
she
get
blackguarded
everywhere
she
help
herself
with
that
face
and
those
eyes
his
mother
laughed
dear
fulke
you
are
such
a
naughty
boy
you
should
make
such
remarks
before
lady
lyle
she
never
says
anything
against
anyone
dear
fulke
stared
had
he
given
vent
to
his
feelings
he
would
have
exclaimed
oh
lord
is
the
old
lady
a
deep
one
but
as
it
was
he
attended
to
his
young
moustache
anxiously
and
remained
silent
lady
chetwynd
lyle
meanwhile
flushed
with
annoyance
she
felt
that
lady
fulkeward
remark
was
sarcastic
but
she
could
not
very
well
resent
it
seeing
that
lady
fulkeward
was
a
peeress
of
the
realm
and
that
she
herself
by
the
strict
laws
of
heraldry
was
truly
only
dame
chetwynd
lyle
as
wife
of
an
ordinary
knight
and
had
no
business
to
be
called
her
ladyship
at
all
i
should
indeed
be
sorry
she
said
primly
if
i
were
mistaken
in
my
private
estimate
of
the
princess
ziska
character
but
i
must
believe
my
own
eyes
and
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
and
surely
no
one
can
condone
the
extremely
fast
way
in
which
she
behaved
with
that
new
man
that
french
artist
armand
gervase
last
night
why
she
danced
six
times
with
him
and
she
actually
allowed
him
to
walk
home
with
her
through
the
streets
of
cairo
they
went
off
together
in
their
fancy
dresses
just
as
they
were
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
oh
there
was
nothing
remarkable
at
all
in
that
said
lord
fulkeward
everybody
went
about
the
place
in
fancy
costume
last
night
i
went
out
in
my
neapolitan
dress
with
a
girl
and
i
met
denzil
murray
coming
down
a
street
just
behind
here
took
him
for
a
florentine
prince
upon
my
word
and
i
bet
you
gervase
never
got
beyond
the
door
of
the
palace
for
that
blessed
old
nubian
she
keeps
the
chap
with
a
face
like
a
mummy
bangs
the
gate
in
everybody
face
and
says
in
guttural
french
princesse
ne
voit
i
tried
it
i
tell
you
it
no
go
well
we
shall
all
get
inside
the
mysterious
palace
next
wednesday
evening
said
lady
fulkeward
closing
her
eyes
with
a
graceful
air
of
languor
it
will
be
charming
i
am
sure
and
i
daresay
we
shall
find
that
there
is
no
mystery
at
all
about
it
two
months
ago
suddenly
said
a
smooth
voice
behind
them
the
ziska
house
or
palace
was
uninhabited
lady
fulkeward
gave
a
little
scream
and
looked
round
good
gracious
dean
how
you
frightened
me
the
doctor
made
an
apologetic
bow
i
am
very
sorry
i
forgot
you
were
so
sensitive
pray
pardon
me
as
i
was
saying
two
months
ago
the
palace
of
the
princess
ziska
was
a
deserted
barrack
formerly
so
i
hear
it
used
to
be
the
house
of
some
great
personage
but
it
had
been
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
and
nobody
would
rent
it
even
for
the
rush
of
the
cairene
season
till
it
was
secured
by
the
nubian
you
were
speaking
of
just
now
the
interesting
nubian
with
the
face
like
a
mummy
he
took
it
and
furnished
it
and
when
it
was
ready
madame
la
princesse
appeared
on
the
scene
and
has
resided
there
every
since
i
wonder
what
that
nubian
has
to
do
with
her
said
lady
chetwynd
lyle
severely
nothing
at
all
replied
the
doctor
calmly
he
is
the
merest
servant
the
kind
of
person
who
is
off
to
attend
on
the
women
of
a
harem
ah
i
see
you
have
been
making
inquiries
concerning
the
princess
doctor
said
lady
fulkeward
with
a
smile
i
have
and
have
you
found
out
anything
about
her
no
that
is
nothing
of
social
importance
except
perhaps
two
items
first
that
she
is
not
a
russian
secondly
that
she
has
never
been
married
never
been
married
exclaimed
lady
chetwynd
lyle
then
suddenly
turning
to
her
daughters
she
said
blandly
muriel
dolly
go
into
the
house
my
dears
it
is
getting
rather
warm
for
you
on
this
terrace
i
will
join
you
in
a
few
minutes
the
girls
rose
obediently
with
a
delightfully
innocent
and
juvenile
air
and
fortunately
for
them
did
not
notice
the
irreverent
smile
that
played
on
young
lord
fulkeward
face
which
was
immediately
reflected
on
the
artistically
tinted
countenance
of
his
mother
at
the
manner
of
their
dismissal
there
is
surely
nothing
improper
in
never
having
been
married
said
dean
with
a
mock
serious
air
consider
my
dear
lady
lyle
is
there
not
something
very
chaste
and
beautiful
in
the
aspect
of
an
old
maid
lady
lyle
looked
up
sharply
she
had
an
idea
that
both
she
and
her
daughters
were
being
quizzed
and
she
had
some
difficulty
to
control
her
rising
temper
then
do
you
call
the
princess
an
old
maid
she
demanded
lady
fulkeward
looked
amused
her
son
laughed
outright
but
the
doctor
face
was
perfectly
composed
i
do
know
what
else
i
can
call
her
he
said
with
a
thoughtful
air
she
is
no
longer
in
her
teens
and
she
has
too
much
voluptuous
charm
for
an
ingenue
still
i
admit
you
would
scarcely
call
her
except
in
the
parlance
of
the
modern
matrimonial
market
our
roues
you
know
prefer
their
victims
young
and
i
fancy
the
princess
ziska
would
be
too
old
and
perhaps
too
clever
for
most
of
them
personally
speaking
she
does
not
impress
me
as
being
of
any
particular
age
but
as
she
is
not
married
and
is
so
to
speak
a
maid
fully
developed
i
am
perforce
obliged
to
call
her
an
old
maid
she
would
thank
you
for
the
compliment
said
lady
lyle
with
a
spiteful
grin
i
daresay
not
responded
the
doctor
blandly
but
i
imagine
she
has
very
little
personal
vanity
her
mind
is
too
preoccupied
with
something
more
important
than
the
consideration
of
her
own
good
looks
and
what
is
that
inquired
lady
fulkeward
with
some
curiosity
ah
there
is
the
difficulty
what
is
it
that
engrosses
our
fair
friend
more
than
the
i
should
like
to
know
but
i
can
not
find
out
it
is
an
enigma
as
profound
as
that
of
the
sphinx
monsieur
gervase
and
turning
round
he
addressed
the
artist
who
just
then
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
carrying
a
paintbox
and
a
large
canvas
strapped
together
in
portable
form
are
you
going
to
sketch
some
picturesque
corner
of
the
city
no
replied
gervase
listlessly
raising
his
white
to
the
ladies
present
with
a
courteous
yet
somewhat
indifferent
grace
going
to
the
princess
ziska
i
shall
probably
get
the
whole
outline
of
her
features
this
morning
a
portrait
inquired
the
doctor
i
fancy
not
not
the
first
attempt
at
any
rate
head
and
shoulders
only
do
you
know
where
her
house
is
asked
lord
fulkeward
if
you
do
i
walk
with
you
and
show
you
the
way
thanks
you
are
very
good
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
and
raising
his
hat
again
he
sauntered
slowly
off
young
fulkeward
walking
with
him
and
chatting
to
him
with
more
animation
than
that
exhausted
and
somewhat
aristocrat
usually
showed
to
anyone
it
is
exceedingly
warm
said
lady
lyle
rising
then
and
putting
away
her
apparatus
i
thought
of
driving
to
the
pyramids
this
afternoon
but
really
there
is
shade
all
the
way
suggested
the
doctor
i
said
as
much
to
a
young
woman
this
morning
who
has
been
in
the
hotel
for
nearly
two
months
and
has
seen
the
pyramids
yet
what
has
she
been
doing
with
herself
asked
lady
fulkeward
smiling
dancing
with
officers
said
dean
how
can
cheops
compare
with
a
moustached
noodle
in
military
uniform
for
the
present
going
to
hunt
for
scarabei
i
thought
you
had
such
a
collection
of
them
already
said
lady
lyle
so
i
have
but
the
princess
had
a
remarkable
one
on
last
night
and
i
want
to
find
another
like
it
it
blue
very
blue
almost
like
a
rare
turquoise
and
it
appears
it
is
the
of
the
warrior
araxes
who
was
a
kind
of
king
in
his
way
or
desert
chief
which
was
about
the
same
thing
in
those
days
he
fought
for
amenhotep
and
seemed
from
all
accounts
to
be
a
greater
man
than
amenhotep
himself
the
princess
ziska
is
a
wonderful
egyptologist
i
had
a
most
interesting
conversation
with
her
last
night
in
the
then
she
is
really
a
woman
of
culture
and
intelligence
queried
lady
lyle
the
doctor
smiled
i
should
say
she
would
be
a
great
deal
too
much
for
the
university
of
oxford
as
far
as
oriental
learning
goes
he
said
she
can
read
the
egyptian
papyri
she
tells
me
and
she
can
decipher
anything
on
any
of
the
monuments
i
only
wish
i
could
persuade
her
to
accompany
me
to
thebes
and
karnak
lady
fulkeward
unfurled
her
fan
and
swayed
it
to
and
fro
with
an
elegant
languor
how
delightful
that
would
be
she
sighed
so
romantic
and
solemn
all
those
dear
old
cities
with
those
marvellous
figures
of
the
egyptians
carved
and
painted
on
the
stones
and
rameses
dear
rameses
he
really
has
good
legs
everywhere
have
you
noticed
that
so
many
of
these
ancient
sculptures
represent
the
egyptians
with
such
angular
bodies
and
such
frightfully
thin
legs
but
rameses
always
has
good
legs
wherever
you
find
him
it
so
refreshing
do
make
up
a
party
dr
dean
we
all
go
with
you
and
i
sure
the
princess
ziska
will
be
the
most
charming
companion
possible
let
us
have
a
dahabeah
i
good
for
half
the
expenses
if
you
will
only
arrange
everything
the
doctor
stroked
his
chin
and
looked
dubious
but
he
was
evidently
attracted
by
the
idea
i
see
about
it
he
said
at
last
meanwhile
i
go
and
have
a
hunt
for
some
traces
of
amenhotep
and
araxes
he
strolled
down
the
terrace
and
lady
chetwynd
lyle
turning
her
back
on
old
lady
fulkeward
went
after
her
girls
while
the
fascinating
fulkeward
herself
continued
to
recline
comfortably
in
her
chair
and
presently
smiled
a
welcome
on
a
man
with
a
fair
moustache
who
came
forward
and
sat
down
beside
her
talking
to
her
in
low
tender
and
confidential
tones
he
was
the
very
impecunious
colonel
of
one
of
the
regiments
then
stationed
in
cairo
and
as
he
never
wasted
time
on
sentiment
he
had
been
lately
thinking
that
a
marriage
with
a
widowed
peeress
who
had
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
her
own
right
might
not
be
a
half
bad
arrangement
for
him
so
he
determined
to
do
the
agreeable
and
as
he
was
a
perfect
adept
in
the
art
of
making
love
without
feeling
it
he
got
on
very
well
and
his
prospects
brightened
steadily
hour
by
hour
meanwhile
young
fulkeward
was
escorting
armand
gervase
through
several
narrow
talking
to
him
as
well
as
he
knew
how
and
trying
in
his
feeble
way
to
draw
him
out
in
which
task
he
met
with
but
indifferent
success
it
must
be
awfully
jolly
and
er
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
be
so
famous
he
observed
glancing
up
at
the
strong
dark
brooding
face
above
him
they
had
a
picture
of
yours
over
in
london
once
i
went
to
see
it
with
my
mother
it
was
called
poignard
do
you
remember
it
gervase
shrugged
his
shoulders
carelessly
yes
i
remember
a
poor
thing
at
its
best
it
was
a
woman
with
a
dagger
in
her
hand
yes
awfully
fine
know
she
was
a
very
dark
woman
too
dark
for
my
taste
and
she
got
a
poignard
clasped
in
in
her
right
hand
of
course
she
was
going
to
murder
somebody
with
it
that
was
plain
enough
you
meant
it
so
did
you
i
suppose
i
did
she
was
in
a
sort
of
eastern
pursued
fulkeward
one
of
your
former
studies
in
egypt
perhaps
gervase
started
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
with
a
bewildered
air
no
no
not
a
former
study
by
any
means
how
could
it
be
this
is
my
first
visit
to
egypt
i
have
never
been
here
before
have
you
really
well
you
find
it
awfully
interesting
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
see
half
as
much
of
it
as
i
should
like
i
a
weak
chap
got
something
wrong
with
my
lungs
awful
bother
but
ca
be
helped
my
mother
wo
let
me
do
too
much
here
we
are
this
is
the
princess
ziska
they
were
standing
in
a
narrow
street
ending
in
a
with
tall
houses
on
each
side
which
cast
long
black
melancholy
shadows
on
the
rough
pavement
below
a
vague
sense
of
gloom
and
oppression
stole
over
gervase
as
he
surveyed
the
outside
of
the
particular
dwelling
fulkeward
pointed
out
to
him
a
square
palatial
building
which
had
no
doubt
once
been
magnificent
in
its
exterior
adornment
but
which
now
owing
to
long
neglect
had
fallen
into
somewhat
melancholy
decay
the
sombre
portal
fantastically
ornamented
with
designs
copied
from
some
of
the
egyptian
monuments
rather
resembled
the
gateway
of
a
tomb
than
an
entrance
to
the
private
residence
of
a
beautiful
living
woman
and
fulkeward
noting
his
companion
silence
added
not
a
very
cheerful
corner
is
it
some
of
these
places
are
regular
holes
know
but
i
daresay
it
all
right
inside
you
have
never
been
inside
never
and
fulkeward
lowered
his
voice
look
up
there
there
the
beast
that
keeps
everybody
out
gervase
followed
his
glance
and
perceived
behind
the
projecting
carved
of
one
of
the
windows
a
dark
wrinkled
face
and
two
gleaming
eyes
which
even
at
that
distance
had
or
appeared
to
have
a
somewhat
sinister
expression
he
the
nastiest
type
of
nubian
i
have
ever
seen
pursued
fulkeward
looks
just
like
a
galvanized
corpse
gervase
smiled
and
perceiving
a
long
at
the
gateway
pulled
it
sharply
in
another
moment
the
nubian
appeared
his
aspect
fully
justifying
lord
fulkeward
description
of
him
the
skin
on
his
face
was
and
wrinkled
in
a
thousand
places
his
lips
were
of
a
livid
blue
and
were
drawn
up
and
down
above
and
below
the
teeth
in
a
kind
of
fixed
grin
while
the
dense
brilliance
of
his
eyes
was
so
fierce
and
fiery
as
to
suggest
those
of
some
savage
beast
athirst
for
prey
madame
la
princesse
ziska
began
gervase
addressing
his
unfascinating
object
with
apparent
indifference
to
his
hideousness
the
nubian
grinning
lips
stretched
themselves
wider
apart
as
in
a
thick
snarling
voice
he
demanded
votre
nom
armand
gervase
entrez
et
moi
queried
fulkeward
with
a
conciliatory
smile
non
pas
vous
monsieur
armand
gervase
seul
fulkeward
gave
a
resigned
shrug
of
his
shoulders
gervase
looked
round
at
him
ere
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
mysterious
habitation
i
sorry
you
have
to
walk
back
alone
do
mention
it
said
fulkeward
affably
you
see
you
have
come
on
business
you
going
to
paint
the
princess
picture
and
i
daresay
this
blessed
old
rascal
knows
that
i
want
nothing
except
to
look
at
his
mistress
and
wonder
what
she
made
of
what
she
made
of
echoed
gervase
in
surprise
do
you
think
she
made
like
other
women
no
ca
say
i
do
she
seems
all
fire
and
vapor
and
eyes
in
the
middle
know
oh
i
an
ass
always
was
but
that
the
feeling
she
gives
me
wish
you
a
pleasant
morning
he
nodded
and
strolled
away
and
gervase
hesitated
yet
another
moment
looking
full
at
the
nubian
who
returned
him
stare
for
stare
maintenant
he
began
oui
maintenant
echoed
the
nubian
la
princesse
ou
est
elle
la
and
the
nubian
pointed
down
a
long
dark
passage
beyond
which
there
seemed
to
be
the
glimmer
of
green
palms
and
other
foliage
elle
vous
attend
monsieur
armand
gervase
entrez
suivez
slowly
gervase
passed
in
and
the
great
door
closed
upon
him
with
a
heavy
clang
the
whole
long
bright
day
passed
and
he
did
not
reappear
not
a
human
foot
crossed
the
lonely
street
and
nothing
was
seen
there
all
through
the
warm
sunshiny
hours
save
the
long
black
shadows
on
the
pavement
which
grew
longer
and
darker
as
the
evening
fell
chapter
vii
within
the
palace
of
the
princess
ziska
a
strange
silence
reigned
in
whatever
way
the
business
of
her
household
was
carried
on
it
was
evidently
with
the
most
absolute
noiselessness
for
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
utter
stillness
environing
her
she
herself
clad
in
white
garments
that
clung
about
her
closely
displaying
the
perfect
outlines
of
her
form
stood
waiting
for
her
guest
in
a
room
that
was
fairly
dazzling
to
the
eye
in
its
profusion
of
exquisitely
assorted
and
harmonized
colors
as
well
as
impressive
to
the
mind
in
its
suggestions
of
the
past
rather
than
of
the
present
quaint
musical
instruments
of
the
fashion
of
thousands
of
years
ago
hung
on
the
walls
or
lay
on
brackets
and
tables
but
no
books
such
as
our
modern
time
produces
were
to
be
seen
only
bundles
of
papyri
and
curious
little
tablets
of
clay
inscribed
with
mysterious
hieroglyphs
flowers
adorned
every
corner
many
of
them
strange
blossoms
which
a
connoisseur
would
have
declared
to
be
unknown
in
egypt
palms
and
ferns
and
foliage
of
every
description
were
banked
up
against
the
walls
in
graceful
profusion
and
from
the
latticed
windows
the
light
filtered
through
colored
squares
giving
a
kind
of
to
the
room
as
though
it
were
a
scene
in
a
dream
rather
than
a
reality
and
even
more
than
her
surroundings
was
the
woman
who
awaited
the
approach
of
her
visitor
her
eyes
turned
towards
the
door
fiery
eyes
filled
with
such
ardent
watchfulness
as
seemed
to
burn
the
very
air
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
gleaming
on
its
prey
the
eyes
of
a
famished
tiger
in
the
dark
were
less
fraught
with
terrific
meaning
than
the
eyes
of
ziska
as
she
listened
attentively
to
the
footsteps
through
the
outside
corridor
which
told
her
that
gervase
was
near
at
last
she
whispered
at
last
the
next
moment
the
nubian
flung
the
door
wide
open
and
announced
monsieur
armand
gervase
she
advanced
with
all
the
wonderful
grace
which
distinguished
her
holding
out
both
her
slim
soft
hands
gervase
caught
them
in
his
own
and
kissed
them
fervently
whereupon
the
nubian
retired
closing
the
door
after
him
you
are
very
welcome
monsieur
gervase
said
the
princess
then
speaking
with
a
measured
slowness
that
was
attractive
as
well
as
soothing
to
the
ear
you
have
left
all
the
dear
english
people
well
at
the
gezireh
palace
lady
fulkeward
was
not
too
tired
after
her
exertions
at
the
ball
and
you
but
gervase
was
gazing
at
her
in
a
speechless
confusion
of
mind
too
great
for
words
a
sudden
inexplicable
emotion
took
possession
of
him
an
emotion
to
which
he
could
give
no
name
but
which
stupefied
him
and
held
him
mute
was
it
her
beauty
which
so
dazzled
his
senses
was
it
some
subtle
perfume
in
the
room
that
awoke
a
dim
haunting
memory
or
what
was
it
that
seemed
so
strangely
familiar
he
struggled
with
himself
and
finally
spoke
out
his
thought
i
have
seen
you
before
princess
i
am
quite
sure
i
have
i
thought
i
had
last
night
but
i
am
positive
about
it
strange
is
it
i
wonder
where
we
really
met
her
dark
eyes
rested
on
him
fully
i
wonder
she
echoed
smiling
the
world
is
so
small
and
so
many
people
nowadays
make
the
tour
that
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
we
should
have
passed
each
other
en
route
through
our
journey
of
life
gervase
still
hesitated
glancing
about
him
with
a
singularly
embarrassed
air
while
she
continued
to
watch
him
intently
presently
his
sensations
whatever
they
were
passed
off
and
gradually
recovering
his
equanimity
he
became
aware
that
he
was
quite
alone
with
one
of
the
most
fascinating
women
he
had
ever
seen
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
smiled
i
have
come
to
paint
your
picture
he
said
softly
shall
i
begin
she
had
seated
herself
on
a
silken
divan
and
her
head
rested
against
a
pile
of
cushions
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
threw
himself
down
beside
her
and
caught
her
hand
in
his
shall
i
paint
your
picture
he
whispered
or
shall
i
make
love
to
you
she
laughed
the
sweet
low
laugh
that
somehow
chilled
his
blood
while
it
charmed
his
hearing
whichever
you
please
she
answered
both
performances
would
no
doubt
be
works
of
art
what
do
you
mean
can
you
not
understand
if
you
paint
my
picture
it
will
be
a
work
of
art
if
you
make
love
to
me
it
will
equally
be
a
work
of
art
that
is
a
composed
thing
an
elaborate
study
bah
love
is
not
a
composed
thing
said
gervase
leaning
closer
to
her
it
is
wild
and
full
of
libertinage
as
the
sea
and
equally
as
fickle
added
the
princess
composedly
taking
a
fan
of
feathers
near
her
and
waving
it
to
and
fro
man
idea
of
love
is
to
take
all
he
can
get
from
a
woman
and
give
her
nothing
in
return
but
misery
sometimes
and
sometimes
death
you
do
not
you
can
not
think
that
said
gervase
looking
at
her
dazzling
face
with
a
passion
of
admiration
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
men
on
the
whole
are
not
as
cruel
or
as
treacherous
as
women
i
would
swear
looking
at
you
that
beautiful
as
you
are
you
are
cruel
and
that
is
perhaps
why
i
love
you
you
are
like
a
splendid
tigress
waiting
to
be
tamed
and
you
think
you
could
tame
me
interposed
ziska
looking
at
him
with
an
inscrutable
disdain
in
her
black
eyes
yes
if
you
loved
me
ah
possibly
but
then
it
happens
that
i
do
not
love
you
i
love
no
one
i
have
had
too
much
of
love
it
is
a
folly
i
have
grown
weary
of
gervase
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
with
an
audacious
look
which
seemed
to
hint
that
he
might
possibly
take
advantage
of
being
alone
with
her
to
enforce
his
ideas
of
love
more
eloquently
than
was
in
accordance
with
the
proprieties
she
perceived
his
humor
smiled
and
coldly
gave
him
back
glance
for
glance
then
rising
from
the
divan
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
surveyed
him
with
a
kind
of
indulgent
contempt
you
are
an
uprincipled
man
armand
gervase
she
said
and
do
you
know
i
fear
you
always
will
be
a
cleansing
of
your
soul
through
centuries
of
fire
will
be
necessary
for
you
in
the
next
world
that
next
world
which
you
do
not
believe
in
but
it
is
perhaps
as
well
to
warn
you
that
i
am
not
without
protection
in
this
place
see
and
as
she
spoke
she
clapped
her
hands
a
clanging
noise
as
of
brazen
bells
answered
her
and
gervase
springing
up
from
his
seat
saw
to
his
utter
amazement
the
apparently
solid
walls
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
divide
rapidly
and
form
themselves
in
several
square
openings
which
showed
a
much
larger
and
vaster
apartment
beyond
resembling
a
great
hall
here
were
assembled
some
twenty
or
thirty
arab
attendants
men
of
a
dark
and
sinister
type
who
appeared
to
be
fully
armed
judging
from
the
daggers
and
other
weapons
they
carried
at
their
belts
the
princess
clapped
her
hands
again
and
the
walls
closed
in
the
same
rapid
fashion
as
they
had
opened
while
the
beautiful
mistress
of
this
strange
habitation
laughed
mirthfully
at
the
complete
confusion
of
her
visitor
and
lover
paint
me
now
she
said
flinging
herself
in
a
picturesque
attitude
on
one
of
the
sofas
close
by
i
am
ready
but
am
not
ready
retorted
gervase
angrily
do
you
take
me
for
a
child
or
a
fool
both
in
one
responded
the
princess
tranquilly
being
a
man
his
breath
came
and
went
quickly
take
care
beautiful
ziska
he
said
take
care
how
you
defy
me
and
take
care
monsieur
gervase
take
care
how
you
defy
me
she
responded
with
a
strange
quick
glance
at
him
do
you
not
realize
what
folly
you
are
talking
you
are
making
love
to
me
in
the
fashion
of
a
brigand
rather
than
a
frenchman
of
good
standing
and
i
i
have
to
defend
myself
against
you
also
by
showing
you
that
i
have
armed
servants
within
call
it
is
very
strange
it
would
frighten
even
lady
fulkeward
and
i
think
she
is
not
easily
frightened
pray
commence
your
work
and
leave
such
an
matter
as
love
to
dreamers
and
pretty
sentimentalists
like
miss
helen
murray
he
was
silent
and
busied
himself
in
unstrapping
his
canvas
and
with
a
great
deal
of
almost
vicious
energy
in
a
few
moments
he
had
gained
sufficient
composure
to
look
full
at
her
and
taking
his
palette
in
hand
he
began
dabbing
on
the
colors
talking
between
whiles
do
you
suppose
he
said
keeping
his
voice
carefully
subdued
that
you
can
intimidate
me
by
showing
me
a
score
of
wretched
black
rascals
whom
you
have
placed
on
guard
to
defend
you
out
there
and
why
did
you
place
them
on
guard
you
must
have
been
afraid
of
me
pardieu
i
could
snatch
you
out
of
their
midst
if
i
chose
you
do
not
know
me
if
you
did
you
would
understand
that
not
all
the
world
armed
to
the
teeth
should
balk
me
of
my
desires
but
i
have
been
too
hasty
that
i
own
i
can
wait
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
she
was
listening
with
an
air
of
amused
indifference
i
shall
have
to
mix
strange
tints
in
your
portrait
ma
belle
it
is
difficult
to
find
the
exact
hue
of
your
skin
there
is
rose
and
brown
in
it
and
there
is
yet
another
color
which
i
must
evolve
while
working
and
it
is
not
the
hue
of
health
it
is
something
dark
and
suggestive
of
death
i
hope
you
are
not
destined
to
an
early
grave
and
yet
why
not
it
is
better
that
a
beautiful
woman
should
die
in
her
beauty
than
live
to
become
old
and
tiresome
you
think
that
interrupted
the
ziska
suddenly
smiling
somewhat
coldly
i
do
most
honestly
had
i
lived
in
the
early
days
of
civilization
when
men
were
allowed
to
have
as
many
women
as
they
could
provide
for
i
would
have
mercifully
killed
any
sweet
favorite
as
soon
as
her
beauty
began
to
wane
a
lovely
woman
dead
in
her
first
exquisite
youth
how
beautiful
a
subject
for
the
mind
to
dwell
upon
how
it
suggests
all
manner
of
poetic
fancies
and
graceful
threnodies
but
a
woman
grown
old
who
has
outlived
all
passion
and
is
a
mere
bundle
of
fat
or
a
mummy
of
skin
and
bone
what
poetry
does
her
existence
suggest
how
can
she
appeal
to
art
or
sentiment
she
is
a
misery
to
herself
and
an
eyesore
to
others
yes
princess
believe
me
love
first
and
death
afterwards
are
woman
best
friends
you
believe
in
death
ask
the
princess
looking
steadily
at
him
it
is
the
only
thing
i
do
believe
in
he
answered
lightly
it
is
a
fact
that
will
bear
examination
but
not
contradiction
may
i
ask
you
to
turn
your
head
slightly
to
the
left
so
yes
that
will
do
if
i
can
catch
the
look
in
your
eyes
that
gleams
there
now
the
look
of
intense
burning
greedy
cruelty
which
is
so
murderously
fascinating
i
shall
be
content
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
and
putting
down
his
palette
took
up
his
canvas
and
posing
it
on
his
knee
began
drawing
the
first
rough
outline
of
his
sketch
in
charcoal
she
meanwhile
leaning
against
cushions
of
amber
satin
remained
silent
you
are
not
a
vain
woman
he
pursued
or
you
would
resent
my
description
of
your
eyes
cruelty
is
not
a
pretty
expression
nor
would
it
be
considered
complimentary
by
the
majority
of
the
fair
sex
yet
from
my
point
of
view
it
is
the
highest
flattery
i
can
pay
you
for
i
adore
the
eyes
of
savage
animals
and
the
beautiful
eye
of
the
is
in
your
head
diableresse
charmante
comme
vous
etes
i
wonder
what
gives
you
such
an
insatiate
love
of
vengeance
he
looked
up
and
saw
her
eyes
glistening
and
narrowing
at
the
corners
like
the
eyes
of
an
angry
snake
if
i
have
such
a
feeling
she
replied
slowly
it
is
probably
a
question
of
heritage
ah
your
parents
were
perhaps
barbaric
in
their
notions
of
love
and
hatred
he
queried
lazily
working
at
his
charcoal
sketch
with
growing
admiration
for
its
result
my
parents
came
of
a
race
of
kings
she
answered
all
my
ancestors
were
proud
and
of
a
temper
unknown
to
this
petty
day
they
resented
a
wrong
they
punished
falsehood
and
treachery
and
they
took
a
life
for
a
life
your
generation
tolerates
every
sin
known
in
the
calendar
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
you
have
arrived
at
the
end
of
your
civilization
even
to
the
denial
of
deity
and
a
future
life
that
is
not
the
end
of
our
civilization
princess
said
gervase
working
away
intently
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
canvas
as
he
talked
that
is
the
triumphal
apex
the
glory
the
culmination
of
everything
that
is
great
and
supreme
in
manhood
in
france
man
now
knows
himself
to
be
the
only
god
england
good
england
is
approaching
france
in
intelligence
by
degrees
and
i
rejoice
to
see
that
it
is
possible
for
a
newspaper
like
the
agnostic
to
exist
in
london
only
the
other
day
that
excellent
journal
was
discussing
the
possibility
of
teaching
monkeys
to
read
and
a
witty
writer
who
adopts
the
nom
de
plume
of
very
cleverly
remarked
supposing
monkeys
were
able
to
read
the
new
testament
they
would
still
remain
monkeys
in
fact
they
would
probably
be
greater
monkeys
than
ever
the
fact
of
such
an
expression
being
allowed
to
pass
muster
in
once
pious
london
is
an
excellent
sign
of
the
times
and
of
our
progress
towards
the
pure
age
of
reason
the
name
of
christ
is
no
longer
one
to
conjure
with
a
dead
silence
followed
his
words
and
the
peculiar
stillness
and
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
struck
him
with
a
vague
alarm
he
lifted
his
eyes
the
princess
ziska
met
his
gaze
steadily
but
there
was
something
in
her
aspect
that
moved
him
to
wonderment
and
a
curious
touch
of
terror
the
delicate
of
her
cheeks
had
faded
to
an
ashy
paleness
her
lips
were
pressed
together
tightly
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
gained
a
vivid
and
angry
lustre
which
medusa
herself
might
have
envied
did
you
ever
try
to
conjure
with
that
name
she
asked
never
he
replied
forcing
a
smile
and
remonstrating
with
himself
for
the
inexplicable
nature
of
his
emotions
she
went
on
slowly
in
my
creed
for
i
have
a
creed
it
is
believed
that
those
who
have
never
taken
the
sacred
name
of
christ
to
their
hearts
as
a
talisman
of
comfort
and
support
are
left
as
it
were
in
the
vortex
of
uncertainties
tossed
to
and
fro
among
many
whirling
and
mighty
forces
and
haunted
forever
by
the
phantoms
of
their
own
evil
deeds
till
they
learn
and
accept
the
truth
of
their
marvellous
redemption
they
are
the
prey
of
wicked
spirits
who
tempt
and
lead
them
on
to
divers
miseries
but
when
the
great
name
of
him
who
died
upon
the
cross
is
acknowledged
then
it
is
found
to
be
of
that
transfiguring
nature
which
turns
evil
to
good
and
sometimes
makes
angels
out
of
fiends
nevertheless
for
the
hardened
reprobate
and
unbeliever
the
old
laws
suffice
gervase
had
stopped
the
quick
movement
of
his
fusin
and
looked
at
her
curiously
what
old
laws
he
asked
stern
justice
without
mercy
she
answered
then
in
lighter
accents
she
added
have
you
finished
your
first
outline
in
reply
he
turned
his
canvas
round
to
her
showing
her
a
head
and
profile
boldly
presented
in
black
and
white
she
smiled
it
is
clever
but
it
is
not
like
me
she
said
when
you
begin
the
coloring
you
will
find
that
your
picture
and
i
have
no
resemblance
to
each
other
he
flushed
with
a
sense
of
wounded
amour
propre
pardon
madame
i
am
no
novice
at
the
art
of
painting
he
said
and
much
as
your
charms
dazzle
and
ensnare
me
they
do
not
disqualify
my
brain
and
hand
from
perfectly
delineating
them
upon
my
canvas
i
love
you
to
distraction
but
my
passion
shall
not
hinder
me
from
making
your
picture
a
masterpiece
she
laughed
what
an
egoist
you
are
monsieur
gervase
she
said
even
in
your
professed
passion
for
me
you
count
yourself
first
me
afterwards
naturally
he
replied
a
man
must
always
be
first
by
natural
creation
when
he
allows
himself
to
play
second
fiddle
he
is
a
fool
and
when
he
is
a
fool
and
he
often
is
he
is
the
first
of
fools
said
the
princess
no
ape
no
baboon
hanging
by
its
tail
to
a
tree
looks
such
a
fool
as
a
for
a
has
had
all
the
opportunities
of
education
and
learning
bestowed
upon
him
this
great
universe
with
its
daily
lessons
of
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
is
his
book
laid
open
for
his
reading
and
when
he
will
neither
read
it
nor
consider
it
and
moreover
when
he
utterly
denies
the
very
maker
of
it
then
there
is
no
fool
in
all
creation
like
him
for
the
does
at
least
admit
that
there
may
be
a
stronger
beast
somewhere
a
creature
who
may
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
end
his
joys
of
hanging
by
his
tail
to
a
tree
and
make
havoc
of
his
and
chattering
while
man
thinks
there
is
nothing
anywhere
superior
to
himself
gervase
smiled
tolerantly
i
am
afraid
i
have
ruffled
you
princess
he
said
i
see
you
have
religious
ideas
i
have
none
once
again
she
laughed
musically
religious
ideas
i
not
at
all
i
have
a
creed
as
i
told
you
but
it
is
an
ugly
one
not
at
all
sentimental
or
agreeable
it
is
one
i
have
adopted
from
ancient
egypt
explain
it
to
me
said
gervase
i
will
adopt
it
also
for
your
sake
it
is
too
supernatural
for
you
she
said
paying
no
heed
to
the
amorous
tone
of
his
voice
or
the
expressive
tenderness
of
his
eyes
never
mind
love
will
make
me
accept
an
army
of
ghosts
if
necessary
one
of
the
chief
tenets
of
my
faith
she
continued
is
the
eternal
immortality
of
each
individual
soul
will
you
accept
that
for
the
moment
certainly
her
eyes
glowed
like
great
jewels
as
she
proceeded
the
egyptian
cult
i
follow
is
very
briefly
explained
the
soul
begins
in
protoplasm
without
conscious
individuality
it
progresses
through
various
forms
till
individual
consciousness
is
attained
once
attained
it
is
never
lost
but
it
lives
on
pressing
towards
perfection
taking
upon
itself
various
phases
of
existence
according
to
the
passions
which
have
most
completely
dominated
it
from
the
first
that
is
all
but
according
to
this
theory
you
might
have
lived
in
the
world
long
ago
and
so
might
i
we
might
even
have
met
and
for
some
reason
or
other
we
may
have
become
now
a
disciple
of
my
creed
would
give
you
that
as
the
reason
why
you
sometimes
imagine
you
have
seen
me
before
as
she
spoke
the
dazed
and
troubled
sensation
he
had
once
previously
experienced
came
upon
him
he
laid
down
the
canvas
he
held
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
bewilderedly
yes
very
curious
and
fantastic
i
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
i
do
believe
in
it
i
ca
believe
in
it
but
if
i
could
if
i
could
imagine
i
had
ever
met
you
in
some
bygone
time
and
you
were
like
what
you
are
at
this
moment
i
should
have
loved
you
i
must
have
loved
you
you
see
i
can
not
leave
the
subject
of
love
alone
and
your
idea
gives
my
fancy
something
to
work
upon
so
beautiful
ziska
if
your
soul
ever
took
the
form
of
a
flower
i
must
have
been
its
companion
blossom
if
it
ever
paced
the
forest
as
a
beast
of
prey
i
must
have
been
its
mate
if
it
ever
was
human
before
then
i
must
have
been
its
lover
do
you
like
such
pretty
follies
i
will
talk
them
by
the
hour
here
he
rose
and
with
a
movement
that
was
half
fierce
and
half
tender
he
knelt
beside
her
taking
her
hands
in
his
own
i
love
you
ziska
i
can
not
help
myself
i
am
drawn
to
you
by
some
force
stronger
than
my
own
will
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
not
yet
as
i
said
i
can
wait
i
can
endure
the
mingled
torture
and
rapture
of
this
sudden
passion
and
make
no
sign
till
my
patience
tires
and
then
then
i
will
win
you
if
i
die
for
it
he
sprang
up
before
she
could
speak
a
word
in
answer
and
seizing
his
canvas
again
exclaimed
gayly
now
for
the
hues
of
morning
and
evening
combined
to
paint
the
radiance
of
this
wicked
soul
of
love
that
so
enthralls
me
first
the
of
midnight
for
the
hair
the
lustre
of
the
coldest
brightest
stars
for
eyes
the
of
early
dawn
for
lips
and
cheeks
ah
how
shall
i
make
a
real
beginning
of
this
marvel
it
will
be
difficult
i
fear
said
ziska
slowly
with
a
faint
cold
smile
and
still
more
difficult
perchance
will
be
the
end
chapter
viii
the
table
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
had
already
begun
when
gervase
entered
the
and
sat
down
near
lady
fulkeward
and
dean
you
have
missed
the
soup
said
her
ladyship
looking
up
at
him
with
a
sweet
smile
all
you
artists
are
alike
you
have
no
idea
whatever
of
time
and
how
have
you
succeeded
with
that
charming
mysterious
person
the
princess
ziska
gervase
kept
his
gaze
steadily
fixed
on
the
he
was
extremely
pale
and
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
gone
through
some
great
mental
exhaustion
i
have
not
succeeded
as
well
as
i
expected
he
answered
slowly
i
think
my
hand
must
have
lost
its
cunning
at
any
rate
whatever
the
reason
may
be
art
has
been
defeated
by
nature
he
crumbled
up
the
piece
of
bread
near
his
plate
in
small
portions
with
a
kind
of
involuntary
violence
in
the
action
and
dean
deliberately
drawing
out
a
pair
of
spectacles
from
their
case
adjusted
them
and
surveyed
him
curiously
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
not
paint
the
princess
picture
gervase
glanced
up
at
him
with
a
expression
i
do
say
that
he
replied
i
can
paint
something
something
which
you
can
call
a
picture
if
you
like
but
there
is
no
resemblance
to
the
princess
ziska
in
it
she
is
beautiful
and
i
can
get
nothing
of
her
beauty
i
can
only
get
the
reflection
of
a
face
which
is
not
hers
how
very
curious
exclaimed
lady
fulkeward
quite
psychological
is
it
not
doctor
it
is
almost
creepy
and
she
managed
to
produce
a
delicate
shudder
of
her
white
shoulders
without
cracking
the
blanc
de
perle
enamel
it
will
be
something
fresh
for
you
to
study
possibly
it
will
possibly
said
the
doctor
still
surveying
gervase
blandly
through
his
round
glasses
but
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
of
painters
who
unconsciously
produce
other
faces
than
those
of
their
sitters
i
distinctly
remember
a
case
in
point
a
gentleman
famous
for
his
charities
and
general
benevolence
had
his
portrait
painted
by
a
great
artist
for
presentation
to
the
of
his
native
place
and
the
artist
was
quite
unable
to
avoid
making
him
unto
the
likeness
of
a
villain
it
was
quite
a
distressing
affair
the
painter
was
probably
more
distressed
than
anybody
about
it
and
he
tried
by
every
possible
means
in
his
power
to
impart
a
truthful
and
noble
aspect
to
the
countenance
of
the
man
who
was
known
and
admitted
to
be
a
benefactor
to
his
race
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
portrait
when
finished
was
the
portrait
of
a
stranger
and
a
scoundrel
the
people
for
whom
it
was
intended
declared
they
would
not
have
such
a
libel
on
their
generous
friend
hung
up
in
their
the
painter
was
in
despair
and
there
was
going
to
be
a
general
hubbub
when
lo
and
behold
the
personage
himself
was
suddenly
arrested
for
a
brutal
murder
committed
twelve
years
back
he
was
found
guilty
and
hanged
and
the
painter
kept
the
portrait
that
had
so
remarkably
betrayed
the
murderer
real
nature
as
a
curiosity
ever
afterwards
is
that
a
fact
inquired
a
man
who
was
seated
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
who
had
listened
with
great
interest
to
the
story
a
positive
fact
said
the
doctor
one
of
those
many
singular
circumstances
which
occur
in
life
and
which
are
beyond
all
explanation
gervase
moved
restlessly
then
filling
for
himself
a
glass
of
claret
drained
it
off
thirstily
something
of
the
same
kind
has
happened
to
me
he
said
with
a
hard
mirthless
laugh
for
out
of
the
most
perfect
beauty
i
have
only
succeeded
in
presenting
an
atrocity
dear
me
exclaimed
lady
fulkeward
what
a
disappointing
day
you
must
have
had
but
of
course
you
will
try
again
the
princess
will
surely
give
you
another
sitting
oh
yes
i
shall
certainly
try
again
and
yet
again
and
ever
so
many
times
again
said
gervase
with
a
kind
of
angry
obstinacy
in
his
tone
the
more
so
as
she
has
told
me
i
will
never
succeed
in
painting
her
she
told
you
that
did
she
put
in
dean
with
an
air
of
lively
interest
yes
just
then
the
handing
round
of
fresh
dishes
and
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
effectually
put
a
stop
to
the
conversation
for
the
time
and
gervase
presently
glancing
about
him
saw
that
denzil
murray
and
his
sister
were
dining
apart
at
a
smaller
table
with
young
lord
fulkeward
and
ross
courtney
helen
was
looking
her
fairest
and
best
that
evening
her
sweet
face
framed
in
its
angel
aureole
of
bright
hair
had
a
singular
look
of
pureness
and
truth
expressed
upon
it
rare
to
find
in
any
woman
beyond
her
early
teens
unconsciously
to
himself
gervase
sighed
as
he
caught
a
view
of
her
delicate
profile
and
lady
fulkeward
sharp
ears
heard
the
sound
of
that
sigh
is
that
a
charming
little
party
over
there
she
asked
young
people
you
know
they
always
like
to
be
together
that
very
sweet
girl
miss
murray
was
so
much
distressed
about
her
brother
something
was
the
matter
with
him
a
touch
of
fever
i
believe
that
she
begged
me
to
let
fulke
dine
with
them
in
order
to
distract
denzil
mind
fulke
is
a
dear
boy
you
know
very
consoling
in
his
ways
though
he
says
so
little
then
courtney
volunteered
to
join
them
and
there
they
are
the
chetwynd
lyles
are
gone
to
a
big
dinner
at
the
continental
this
evening
the
chetwynd
lyles
let
me
see
who
are
they
mused
gervase
aloud
do
i
know
them
no
that
is
you
have
not
been
formally
introduced
said
dean
sir
chetwynd
lyle
is
the
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
london
daily
dial
lady
chetwynd
lyle
is
his
wife
and
the
two
ladies
who
appeared
as
fishwives
last
night
at
the
ball
are
his
daughters
cruel
man
exclaimed
lady
fulkeward
with
a
girlish
giggle
the
idea
of
calling
those
sweet
girls
muriel
and
dolly
what
are
they
my
dear
madam
what
are
they
demanded
the
imperturbable
little
savant
is
a
very
convenient
expression
and
applies
perfectly
to
people
who
refuse
to
be
old
and
can
not
possibly
be
young
nonsense
i
will
not
listen
to
you
and
her
ladyship
opened
her
jewelled
fan
and
spread
it
before
her
eyes
to
completely
screen
the
objectionable
doctor
from
view
do
you
know
your
theories
are
quite
out
of
date
nobody
is
old
we
all
utterly
refuse
to
be
old
why
and
she
shut
her
fan
with
a
sudden
jerk
i
shall
have
you
calling
me
old
next
never
madam
said
dean
gallantly
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
you
are
quite
an
exception
to
the
rule
you
have
passed
through
the
furnace
of
marriage
and
come
out
unscathed
time
has
done
its
worst
with
you
and
now
retreats
baffled
and
powerless
it
can
touch
you
no
more
whether
this
was
meant
as
a
compliment
or
the
reverse
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
but
lady
fulkeward
graciously
accepted
it
as
the
choicest
flattery
and
bowed
smiling
and
gratified
dinner
was
now
drawing
to
its
end
and
people
were
giving
their
orders
for
coffee
to
be
served
to
them
on
the
terrace
and
in
the
gardens
gervase
among
the
rest
the
doctor
turned
to
him
i
should
like
to
see
your
picture
of
the
princess
he
said
that
is
if
you
have
no
objection
not
the
least
in
the
world
replied
gervase
only
it
is
the
princess
it
is
somebody
else
a
faint
shudder
passed
over
him
the
doctor
noticed
it
talking
of
curious
things
went
on
that
irrepressible
savant
i
started
hunting
for
a
particular
scarabeus
i
could
find
it
of
course
it
generally
takes
years
to
find
even
a
trifle
that
one
especially
wants
but
i
came
across
a
queer
old
man
in
one
of
the
who
told
me
that
over
at
karnak
they
had
just
discovered
a
large
fresco
in
one
of
the
tombs
describing
the
exploits
of
the
very
man
whose
track
i
on
araxes
gervase
started
he
knew
not
why
what
has
araxes
to
do
with
you
he
demanded
oh
nothing
but
the
princess
ziska
spoke
of
him
as
a
great
warrior
in
the
days
of
amenhotep
and
she
seems
to
be
a
great
egyptologist
and
to
know
many
things
of
which
we
are
ignorant
then
you
know
last
night
she
adopted
the
costume
of
a
dancer
of
that
period
named
well
now
it
appears
that
in
one
part
of
this
fresco
the
scene
depicted
is
this
very
dancing
before
araxes
gervase
listened
with
strained
attention
his
heart
beat
thickly
as
though
the
doctor
were
telling
him
of
some
horrible
circumstance
in
which
he
had
an
active
part
whereas
he
had
truly
no
interest
at
all
in
the
matter
except
in
so
far
as
events
of
history
are
more
or
less
interesting
to
everyone
well
he
said
after
a
pause
well
echoed
dean
there
is
really
nothing
more
to
say
beyond
that
i
want
to
find
out
everything
i
can
concerning
this
araxes
if
only
for
the
reason
that
the
charming
princess
chose
to
impersonate
his
last
night
one
must
amuse
one
self
in
one
own
fashion
even
in
egypt
and
this
amuses
me
gervase
rose
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
his
come
he
said
briefly
i
will
show
you
my
picture
he
straightened
his
tall
fine
figure
and
walked
slowly
across
the
room
to
the
table
where
denzil
murray
sat
with
his
sister
and
friends
denzil
he
said
i
have
made
a
strange
portrait
of
the
princess
ziska
and
i
going
to
show
it
to
dean
i
should
like
you
to
see
it
too
will
you
come
denzil
looked
at
him
with
a
dark
reproach
in
his
eyes
if
you
like
he
answered
shortly
i
do
like
and
gervase
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
fellow
shoulder
with
a
kind
pressure
you
will
find
it
a
piece
of
curious
disenchantment
as
well
as
a
proof
of
my
want
of
skill
you
are
all
welcome
to
come
and
look
at
it
except
here
he
hesitated
except
miss
murray
i
think
yes
i
think
it
might
possibly
frighten
miss
murray
helen
raised
her
eyes
to
his
but
said
nothing
oh
by
jove
murmured
lord
fulkeward
feeling
his
moustache
as
usual
then
do
you
come
miss
murray
we
tell
you
all
about
it
afterwards
i
have
no
curiosity
on
the
subject
she
said
a
trifle
coldly
denzil
you
will
find
me
in
the
i
have
a
letter
to
write
home
with
a
slight
salute
she
left
them
gervase
watching
the
disappearance
of
her
graceful
figure
with
a
tinge
of
melancholy
regret
in
his
eyes
it
is
evident
mademoiselle
helen
does
not
like
the
princess
ziska
he
observed
oh
well
as
to
that
said
fulkeward
hastily
you
know
you
expect
women
to
lose
their
heads
about
her
as
men
do
beside
something
rather
strange
in
the
princess
manner
and
appearance
and
perhaps
miss
murray
does
take
to
her
any
more
than
i
do
oh
then
you
are
not
one
of
her
lovers
queried
dean
smiling
no
are
you
i
good
heavens
my
dear
young
sir
i
was
never
in
love
with
a
woman
in
my
life
that
is
not
what
you
would
call
in
love
at
the
age
of
sixteen
i
wrote
verses
to
a
mature
young
damsel
of
forty
a
woman
with
a
remarkably
fine
figure
and
plenty
of
it
she
rejected
my
advances
with
scorn
and
i
have
never
loved
since
they
all
laughed
even
denzil
murray
sullen
features
cleared
for
the
moment
into
the
brightness
of
a
smile
where
did
you
paint
the
princess
picture
inquired
ross
courtney
suddenly
in
her
own
house
replied
gervase
but
we
were
not
alone
for
the
fascinating
fair
one
had
some
twenty
or
more
armed
servants
within
call
there
was
a
movement
of
surprise
among
his
listeners
and
he
went
on
yes
madame
is
very
well
protected
i
assure
you
as
much
so
as
if
she
were
the
first
favorite
in
a
harem
come
now
and
see
my
sketch
he
led
the
way
to
a
private
which
he
had
secured
for
himself
in
the
hotel
at
almost
fabulous
terms
it
was
a
small
apartment
but
it
had
the
advantage
of
a
long
french
window
which
opened
out
into
the
garden
here
on
an
easel
was
a
canvas
with
its
back
turned
towards
the
spectator
sit
down
said
gervase
abruptly
addressing
his
guests
and
be
prepared
for
a
curiosity
unlike
anything
you
have
ever
seen
before
he
paused
a
moment
looking
steadily
at
dean
perhaps
doctor
as
you
are
interested
in
psychic
phenomena
you
may
be
able
to
explain
how
i
got
such
a
face
on
my
canvas
for
i
can
not
explain
it
to
myself
he
slowly
turned
the
canvas
round
and
scarcely
heeding
the
exclamation
of
amazement
that
broke
simultaneously
from
all
the
men
present
stared
at
it
himself
fascinated
by
a
singular
magnetism
more
potent
than
either
horror
or
fear
chapter
ix
what
a
strange
and
awful
face
it
was
what
a
thing
of
distorted
passion
and
pain
what
an
agony
was
expressed
in
every
line
of
the
features
agony
in
which
the
traces
of
a
divine
beauty
lingered
only
to
render
the
whole
countenance
more
repellent
and
terrific
a
kind
of
sentient
solemnity
mingled
with
wrath
and
terror
glared
from
the
painted
eyes
the
lips
slightly
parted
in
a
cruel
upward
curve
seemed
about
to
utter
a
shriek
of
menace
the
hair
drooping
in
black
thick
clusters
low
on
the
brow
looked
wet
as
with
the
dews
of
the
rigor
mortis
and
to
add
to
the
mysterious
horror
of
the
whole
conception
the
distinct
outline
of
a
was
seen
plainly
through
the
there
was
no
real
resemblance
in
this
horrible
picture
to
the
radiant
and
glowing
loveliness
of
the
princess
ziska
yet
at
the
same
time
there
was
sufficient
dim
likeness
to
make
an
imaginative
person
think
it
might
be
possible
for
her
to
assume
that
appearance
in
death
several
minutes
passed
in
utter
silence
then
lord
fulkeward
suddenly
rose
i
going
he
said
it
a
beastly
thing
it
makes
me
sick
grand
merci
said
gervase
with
a
forced
smile
i
really
ca
help
it
declared
the
young
man
turning
his
back
to
the
picture
if
i
am
rude
you
must
excuse
it
i
not
very
strong
my
mother
will
tell
you
i
get
put
out
very
easily
and
i
shall
dream
of
this
horrid
face
all
night
if
i
do
give
it
a
wide
berth
and
without
any
further
remark
he
stepped
out
through
the
open
window
into
the
garden
and
walked
off
gervase
made
no
comment
on
his
departure
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
dean
who
with
spectacles
on
nose
was
staring
hard
at
the
picture
with
every
sign
of
the
deepest
interest
well
doctor
he
said
you
see
it
is
not
at
all
like
the
princess
oh
yes
it
is
returned
the
doctor
placidly
if
you
could
imagine
the
princess
face
in
torture
it
would
be
like
her
it
is
the
kind
of
expression
she
might
wear
if
she
suddenly
met
with
a
violent
end
but
why
should
i
paint
her
so
demanded
gervase
she
was
perfectly
tranquil
and
her
attitude
was
most
picturesquely
composed
i
sketched
her
as
i
thought
i
saw
her
how
did
this
tortured
head
come
on
my
canvas
the
doctor
scratched
his
chin
thoughtfully
it
was
certainly
a
problem
he
stared
hard
at
gervase
as
though
searching
for
the
clue
to
the
mystery
in
the
handsome
artist
own
face
then
he
turned
to
denzil
murray
who
had
not
stirred
or
spoken
what
do
you
think
of
it
eh
denzil
he
asked
the
young
man
started
as
from
a
dream
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
it
and
you
said
the
doctor
addressing
ross
courtney
i
oh
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
fulkeward
i
think
it
is
a
horrible
thing
and
the
curious
part
of
the
matter
is
that
it
is
like
the
princess
ziska
and
yet
totally
unlike
upon
my
word
you
know
it
is
a
very
unpleasant
picture
dean
got
up
and
paced
the
room
two
or
three
times
his
brows
knitted
in
a
heavy
frown
suddenly
he
stopped
in
front
of
gervase
tell
me
he
said
have
you
any
recollection
of
ever
having
met
the
princess
ziska
before
gervase
looked
puzzled
then
answered
slowly
no
i
have
no
actual
recollection
of
the
kind
at
the
same
time
i
admit
to
you
that
there
is
something
about
her
which
has
always
struck
me
as
being
familiar
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
the
peculiar
cadence
of
her
laughter
particularly
affect
me
in
this
way
last
night
when
i
was
dancing
with
her
i
wondered
whether
i
had
ever
come
across
her
as
a
model
in
one
of
the
studios
in
paris
or
rome
the
doctor
listened
to
him
attentively
watching
him
narrowly
the
while
but
he
shook
his
head
incredulously
at
the
idea
of
the
princess
ever
having
posed
as
a
model
no
no
that
wo
do
he
said
i
do
not
believe
she
was
ever
in
the
model
business
think
again
you
are
now
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
monsieur
gervase
but
look
back
to
your
early
youth
the
period
when
young
men
do
wild
reckless
and
often
wicked
things
did
you
ever
in
that
thoughtless
time
break
a
woman
heart
gervase
flushed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
pardieu
i
may
have
done
who
can
tell
but
if
i
did
what
would
that
have
to
do
with
this
and
he
tapped
the
picture
impatiently
the
doctor
sat
down
and
smacked
his
lips
with
a
peculiar
air
of
enjoyment
it
would
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
he
answered
that
is
psychologically
speaking
i
have
known
of
such
cases
we
will
argue
the
point
out
systematically
thus
suppose
that
you
in
your
boyhood
had
wronged
some
woman
and
suppose
that
woman
had
died
you
might
imagine
you
had
got
rid
of
that
woman
but
if
her
love
was
very
strong
and
her
sense
of
outrage
very
bitter
i
must
tell
you
that
you
have
not
got
rid
of
her
by
any
means
moreover
you
never
will
get
rid
of
her
and
why
because
her
soul
like
all
souls
is
imperishable
now
putting
it
as
a
mere
supposition
and
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
you
feel
a
certain
admiration
for
the
princess
ziska
an
admiration
which
might
possibly
deepen
into
something
more
than
platonic
here
denzil
murray
looked
up
his
eyes
glowing
with
an
angry
pain
as
he
fixed
them
on
gervase
why
then
the
soul
of
the
other
woman
you
once
wronged
might
come
between
you
and
the
face
of
the
new
attraction
and
cause
you
to
unconsciously
paint
the
tortured
look
of
the
injured
and
unforgiving
spirit
on
the
countenance
of
the
lovely
fascinator
whose
charms
are
just
beginning
to
ensnare
you
i
repeat
i
have
known
of
such
cases
and
unheeding
the
amazed
and
incredulous
looks
of
his
listeners
the
little
doctor
folded
both
his
short
arms
across
his
chest
and
hugged
himself
in
the
exquisite
delight
of
his
own
strange
theories
the
fact
is
he
continued
you
can
not
get
rid
of
ghosts
they
are
all
about
us
everywhere
sometimes
they
take
forms
sometimes
they
are
content
to
remain
invisible
but
they
never
fail
to
make
their
presence
felt
often
during
the
performance
of
some
great
piece
of
music
they
drift
between
the
air
and
the
melody
making
the
sounds
wilder
and
more
haunting
and
freezing
the
blood
of
the
listener
with
a
vague
agony
and
chill
sometimes
they
come
between
us
and
our
friends
mysteriously
forbidding
any
further
exchange
of
civilities
or
sympathies
and
occasionally
they
meet
us
alone
and
walk
and
talk
with
us
invisibly
generally
they
mean
well
but
sometimes
they
mean
and
the
only
explanation
i
can
offer
you
monsieur
gervase
as
to
the
present
picture
problem
is
that
a
ghost
must
have
come
between
you
and
your
canvas
gervase
laughed
loudly
my
good
friend
you
are
an
adept
in
the
art
of
pleading
the
impossible
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
a
sceptic
and
i
hope
i
am
also
in
possession
of
my
sober
reason
therefore
you
can
hardly
wonder
at
my
entirely
refusing
to
accept
such
preposterous
theories
as
those
you
appear
to
believe
in
dean
gave
him
a
civil
little
bow
i
do
not
ask
you
to
accept
them
my
dear
sir
i
state
my
facts
and
you
can
take
them
or
leave
them
just
as
you
please
you
yourself
can
offer
no
explanation
of
the
singular
way
in
which
this
picture
has
been
produced
i
offer
one
which
is
perfectly
tenable
with
the
discoveries
of
psychic
science
and
you
dismiss
it
as
preposterous
that
being
the
case
i
should
recommend
you
to
cut
up
this
canvas
and
try
your
hand
again
on
the
same
subject
of
course
i
shall
try
again
retorted
gervase
but
i
do
not
think
i
shall
destroy
this
first
sketch
it
is
a
curiosity
in
its
way
and
it
has
a
peculiar
fascination
for
me
do
you
notice
how
thoroughly
egyptian
the
features
are
they
are
the
very
contour
of
some
of
the
faces
on
the
frescoes
oh
i
noticed
that
at
once
said
the
doctor
but
that
is
not
remarkable
seeing
that
you
yourself
are
quite
of
an
egyptian
type
though
a
frenchman
so
much
so
in
fact
that
many
people
in
this
hotel
have
commented
on
it
gervase
said
nothing
but
slowly
turned
the
canvas
round
with
its
face
to
the
wall
you
have
seen
enough
of
it
i
suppose
he
inquired
of
denzil
murray
more
than
enough
gervase
smiled
it
ought
to
disenchant
you
he
said
in
a
lower
tone
but
it
is
a
libel
on
her
beauty
it
is
not
in
the
least
like
her
returned
murray
coldly
not
in
the
very
least
are
you
sure
my
dear
denzil
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
is
a
likeness
combined
with
a
dreadful
unlikeness
and
it
is
that
which
troubles
both
of
us
i
assure
you
my
good
boy
i
am
as
sorry
for
you
as
i
am
for
myself
for
i
feel
that
this
woman
will
be
the
death
of
one
or
both
of
us
denzil
made
no
reply
and
presently
they
all
strolled
out
in
the
garden
and
lit
their
cigars
and
cigarettes
with
the
exception
of
dean
who
never
smoked
and
never
drank
anything
stronger
than
water
i
am
going
to
get
up
a
party
for
the
nile
he
said
as
he
turned
his
sharp
eyes
upwards
to
the
clear
heavens
and
i
shall
take
the
princess
into
my
confidence
in
fact
i
have
written
to
her
about
it
i
hear
she
has
a
magnificent
electric
dahabeah
and
if
she
will
let
us
charter
it
she
wo
said
denzil
hastily
unless
she
goes
with
it
herself
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
her
observed
dean
indulgently
and
why
should
she
not
go
herself
she
is
evidently
well
instructed
in
the
ancient
history
of
egypt
and
as
she
reads
the
hieroglyphs
she
will
be
a
delightful
guide
and
a
most
valuable
assistant
to
me
in
my
researches
what
researches
are
you
engaged
upon
now
inquired
courtney
i
am
hunting
down
a
man
called
araxes
answered
the
doctor
he
lived
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
some
four
or
five
thousand
years
ago
more
or
less
and
i
want
to
find
out
what
he
did
and
how
he
died
and
when
i
know
how
he
died
then
i
mean
to
discover
where
he
is
buried
if
possible
i
shall
excavate
him
i
also
want
to
find
the
remains
of
the
lady
impersonated
by
our
charming
friend
the
princess
last
night
the
dancer
who
it
appears
from
a
fresco
occupied
most
of
her
time
in
dancing
before
this
same
araxes
and
making
herself
generally
agreeable
to
him
what
an
odd
fancy
exclaimed
denzil
how
can
a
man
and
woman
dead
five
thousand
years
ago
be
of
any
interest
to
you
what
interest
has
rameses
demanded
the
doctor
politely
or
any
of
the
ptolemies
araxes
like
rameses
may
lead
to
fresh
discoveries
in
egypt
for
all
we
know
one
name
is
as
good
as
another
and
each
odoriferous
mummy
has
its
own
mystery
they
all
came
just
then
to
a
pause
in
their
walk
gervase
stopping
to
light
a
fresh
cigarette
the
rays
of
the
rising
moon
fell
upon
him
as
he
stood
a
tall
and
stately
figure
against
a
background
of
palms
and
shone
on
his
dark
features
with
a
touch
of
luminance
that
gave
him
for
the
moment
an
almost
spectral
appearance
dean
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
what
a
figure
of
an
egyptian
is
he
not
he
said
to
courtney
and
denzil
murray
look
at
him
what
height
and
symmetry
what
a
world
of
ferocity
in
those
black
slumbrous
eyes
yes
monsieur
gervase
i
am
talking
about
you
i
am
admiring
you
trop
murmured
gervase
carefully
shielding
with
one
hand
the
match
with
which
he
was
kindling
his
cigarette
yes
continued
the
doctor
i
am
admiring
you
being
a
little
man
myself
i
naturally
like
tall
men
and
as
an
investigator
of
psychic
forms
i
am
immensely
interested
when
i
see
a
body
in
which
the
soul
lies
torpid
that
is
why
you
unconsciously
compose
for
me
a
wonderful
subject
of
study
i
wonder
now
how
long
this
torpidity
in
the
psychic
germ
has
lasted
in
you
it
commenced
of
course
originally
in
protoplasm
but
it
must
have
continued
through
various
low
forms
and
met
with
enormous
difficulties
in
attaining
to
individual
consciousness
as
man
because
even
now
it
is
scarcely
conscious
gervase
laughed
why
that
beginning
of
the
soul
in
protoplasm
is
part
of
a
creed
which
the
princess
ziska
was
trying
to
teach
me
he
said
lightly
it
all
no
use
i
do
believe
in
the
soul
if
i
did
i
should
be
a
miserable
man
why
asked
murray
why
because
my
dear
fellow
i
should
be
rather
afraid
of
my
future
i
should
not
like
to
live
again
i
might
have
to
remember
certain
incidents
which
i
would
rather
forget
there
is
your
charming
sister
mademoiselle
helen
i
must
go
and
talk
to
her
her
conversation
always
does
me
good
and
after
that
picture
which
i
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
produce
her
presence
will
be
as
soothing
as
the
freshness
of
morning
after
an
unpleasant
nightmare
he
moved
away
denzil
murray
with
courtney
followed
him
dean
remained
behind
and
presently
sitting
down
in
a
retired
corner
of
the
garden
alone
he
took
out
a
small
and
stylographic
pen
and
occupied
himself
for
more
than
half
an
hour
in
busily
writing
till
he
had
covered
two
or
three
pages
with
his
small
neat
caligraphy
it
is
the
most
interesting
problem
i
ever
had
the
chance
of
studying
he
murmured
half
aloud
when
he
had
finished
of
course
if
my
researches
into
the
psychic
spheres
of
action
are
worth
anything
it
can
only
be
one
case
out
of
thousands
thousands
aye
perhaps
millions
great
heavens
among
what
terrific
unseen
forces
we
live
and
in
exact
proportion
to
every
man
arrogant
denial
of
the
that
shapes
our
ends
so
will
be
measured
out
to
him
the
revelation
of
the
invisible
strange
that
the
human
race
has
never
entirely
realized
as
yet
the
depth
of
meaning
in
the
words
describing
hell
the
worm
dieth
not
and
where
the
flame
is
never
quenched
the
is
retribution
the
is
the
immortal
spirit
and
the
two
are
forever
striving
to
escape
from
the
other
horrible
and
yet
there
are
men
who
believe
in
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
and
reject
the
redemption
that
does
away
with
both
god
forgive
us
all
our
sins
and
especially
the
sins
of
pride
and
presumption
and
with
a
shade
of
profound
melancholy
on
his
features
the
little
doctor
put
by
his
and
avoiding
all
the
hotel
loungers
on
the
terrace
and
elsewhere
retired
to
his
own
room
and
went
to
bed
chapter
x
the
next
day
when
armand
gervase
went
to
call
on
the
princess
ziska
he
was
refused
admittance
the
nubian
attendant
who
kept
watch
and
ward
at
her
gates
hearing
the
ring
contented
himself
with
thrusting
his
ugly
head
through
an
open
upper
window
and
shouting
madame
est
sortie
ou
donc
called
gervase
in
answer
a
la
campagne
le
desert
les
pyramides
returned
the
nubian
at
the
same
time
banging
the
lattice
to
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
any
further
conversation
and
gervase
standing
in
the
street
irresolutely
for
a
moment
fancied
he
heard
a
peal
of
malicious
laughter
in
the
distance
beast
he
muttered
i
must
try
him
with
a
money
bribe
next
time
i
get
hold
of
him
i
wonder
what
i
shall
do
with
myself
now
haunted
and
as
i
am
by
this
woman
and
her
picture
the
hot
sun
glared
in
his
eyes
and
made
them
ache
the
rough
stones
of
the
narrow
street
were
scorching
to
his
feet
he
began
to
move
slowly
away
with
a
curious
faint
sensation
of
giddiness
and
sickness
upon
him
when
the
sound
of
music
floating
from
the
direction
of
the
princess
ziska
palace
brought
him
to
a
sudden
standstill
it
was
a
strange
wild
melody
played
on
some
instrument
with
seemingly
muffled
strings
a
voice
with
a
deep
throbbing
thrill
of
sweetness
in
it
began
to
sing
oh
for
the
passionless
peace
of
the
it
floats
in
a
waking
dream
on
the
waters
chilly
with
its
leaves
unfurled
to
the
wondering
world
knowing
naught
of
the
sorrow
and
restless
pain
that
burns
and
tortures
the
human
brain
oh
for
the
passionless
peace
of
the
oh
for
the
pure
cold
heart
of
the
bared
to
the
moon
on
the
waters
dark
and
chilly
a
star
above
is
its
only
love
and
one
brief
sigh
of
its
scented
breath
is
all
it
will
ever
know
of
death
oh
for
the
pure
cold
heart
of
the
when
the
song
ceased
gervase
raised
his
eyes
from
the
ground
on
which
he
had
fixed
them
in
a
kind
of
brooding
stupor
and
stared
at
the
burning
blue
of
the
sky
as
vaguely
and
wildly
as
a
sick
man
in
the
delirium
of
fever
god
what
ails
me
he
muttered
supporting
himself
with
one
hand
against
the
black
and
crumbling
wall
near
which
he
stood
why
should
that
melody
steal
away
my
strength
and
make
me
think
of
things
with
which
i
have
surely
no
connection
what
tricks
my
imagination
plays
me
in
this
city
of
the
orient
i
might
as
well
be
hypnotized
what
have
i
to
do
with
dreams
of
war
and
triumph
and
rapine
and
murder
and
what
is
the
name
of
to
me
he
shook
himself
with
the
action
of
a
fine
brute
that
has
been
stung
by
some
teasing
insect
and
mastering
his
emotions
by
an
effort
walked
away
but
he
was
so
absorbed
in
strange
thoughts
that
he
stumbled
up
against
denzil
murray
in
a
side
street
on
the
way
to
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
without
seeing
him
and
would
have
passed
him
altogether
had
not
denzil
somewhat
fiercely
said
stop
gervase
looked
at
him
bewilderedly
why
denzil
is
it
you
my
dear
fellow
forgive
me
my
brusquerie
i
believe
i
have
got
a
stroke
of
the
sun
or
something
of
the
sort
i
assure
you
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
doing
or
where
i
am
going
i
believe
it
said
denzil
hoarsely
you
are
as
mad
as
i
am
for
love
gervase
smiled
a
slight
incredulous
smile
you
think
so
i
am
not
sure
if
love
makes
a
man
as
thoroughly
unstrung
and
nervous
as
i
am
then
love
is
a
very
bad
illness
it
is
the
worst
illness
in
the
world
said
denzil
speaking
hurriedly
and
wildly
the
most
cruel
and
torturing
and
there
is
no
cure
for
it
save
death
my
god
gervase
you
were
my
friend
but
yesterday
i
never
should
have
thought
it
possible
to
hate
you
yet
you
do
hate
me
queried
gervase
still
smiling
a
little
hate
you
i
could
kill
you
you
have
been
with
her
quietly
gervase
took
his
arm
my
good
denzil
you
are
mistaken
i
confess
to
you
frankly
i
should
have
been
with
her
you
mean
the
princess
ziska
of
course
had
it
been
possible
but
she
has
fled
the
city
for
the
moment
at
least
according
to
the
nubian
who
acts
as
porter
he
lies
exclaimed
denzil
hotly
i
saw
her
this
morning
i
hope
you
improved
your
opportunity
said
gervase
imperturbably
anyway
at
the
present
moment
she
is
not
visible
a
silence
fell
between
them
for
some
minutes
then
denzil
spoke
again
gervase
it
is
no
use
i
can
not
stand
this
sort
of
thing
we
must
have
it
out
what
does
it
all
mean
it
is
difficult
to
explain
my
dear
boy
answered
gervase
half
seriously
half
mockingly
it
means
i
presume
that
we
are
both
in
love
with
the
same
woman
and
that
we
both
intend
to
try
our
chances
with
her
but
as
i
told
you
the
other
night
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
quarrel
about
it
your
intentions
towards
the
princess
are
honorable
mine
are
dishonorable
and
i
shall
make
no
secret
of
them
if
you
win
her
i
shall
he
paused
and
there
was
a
sudden
look
in
his
eyes
which
gave
them
a
sombre
darkness
darker
than
their
own
natural
color
you
shall
what
asked
denzil
do
something
desperate
replied
gervase
what
the
something
will
be
depends
on
the
humor
of
the
moment
a
tiger
balked
of
his
prey
is
not
an
agreeable
beast
a
strong
man
deprived
of
the
woman
he
passionately
desires
is
a
little
less
agreeable
even
than
the
tiger
but
let
us
adopt
the
policy
of
nothing
is
decided
the
fair
one
cares
for
neither
of
us
let
us
be
friends
until
she
makes
her
choice
we
can
not
be
friends
said
denzil
sternly
good
let
us
be
foes
then
but
courteous
even
in
our
quarrel
dear
boy
if
we
must
kill
each
other
let
us
do
it
civilly
to
fly
at
each
other
throats
would
be
purely
barbaric
we
owe
a
certain
duty
to
civilization
things
have
progressed
since
the
days
of
araxes
denzil
stared
at
him
gloomily
araxes
is
dean
fad
he
said
i
do
know
anything
about
egyptian
mummies
and
do
want
to
know
my
matter
is
with
the
present
and
not
with
the
past
they
had
reached
the
hotel
by
this
time
and
turned
into
the
gardens
side
by
side
you
understand
repeated
denzil
we
can
not
be
friends
gervase
gave
him
a
profoundly
courteous
salute
and
the
two
separated
later
on
in
the
afternoon
about
an
hour
before
gervase
strolling
on
the
terrace
of
the
hotel
alone
saw
helen
murray
seated
at
a
little
distance
under
some
trees
with
a
book
in
her
hand
which
she
was
not
reading
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
but
as
he
approached
her
she
furtively
dashed
them
away
and
greeted
him
with
a
poor
attempt
at
a
smile
you
have
a
moment
to
spare
me
he
asked
sitting
down
beside
her
she
bent
her
head
in
acquiescence
i
am
a
very
unhappy
man
mademoiselle
helen
he
began
looking
at
her
with
a
certain
compassionate
tenderness
as
he
spoke
i
want
your
sympathy
but
i
know
i
do
not
deserve
it
helen
remained
silent
a
faint
flush
crimsoned
her
cheeks
but
her
eyes
were
veiled
under
the
long
lashes
she
thought
he
could
not
see
them
you
remember
he
went
on
our
pleasant
times
in
scotland
ah
it
is
a
restful
place
your
highland
home
with
the
beautiful
purple
hills
rolling
away
in
the
distance
and
the
glorious
moors
covered
with
fragrant
heather
and
the
gurgling
of
the
river
that
runs
between
birch
and
fir
and
willow
making
music
all
day
long
for
those
who
have
the
ears
to
listen
and
the
hearts
to
understand
the
pretty
love
tune
it
sings
you
know
frenchmen
always
have
more
or
less
sympathy
with
the
scotch
some
old
association
perhaps
with
the
romantic
times
of
mary
queen
of
scots
when
the
light
and
changeful
fancies
of
chastelard
and
his
brother
poets
and
lutists
made
havoc
in
the
hearts
of
many
a
highland
maiden
what
is
that
bright
drop
on
your
hand
helen
are
you
crying
he
waited
a
moment
and
his
voice
was
softer
and
more
tremulous
dear
girl
i
am
not
worthy
of
tears
i
am
not
good
enough
for
you
he
gave
her
time
to
recover
her
momentary
emotion
and
then
went
on
still
softly
and
tenderly
listen
helen
i
want
you
to
believe
me
and
forgive
me
if
you
can
i
know
i
remember
those
moonlight
evenings
in
scotland
holy
and
happy
evenings
as
sweet
as
pages
in
a
young
girl
missal
yes
and
i
did
not
mean
to
play
with
you
helen
or
wound
your
gentle
heart
i
almost
loved
you
he
spoke
the
words
passionately
and
for
a
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
in
something
of
fear
as
well
as
sorrow
i
said
to
my
self
woman
so
true
and
pure
and
fair
is
a
bride
for
a
king
and
if
i
can
win
her
if
ah
there
my
musings
stopped
but
i
came
to
egypt
chiefly
to
meet
you
again
knowing
that
you
and
your
brother
were
in
cairo
how
was
i
to
know
how
was
i
to
guess
that
this
horrible
thing
would
happen
helen
gazed
at
him
wonderingly
what
horrible
thing
she
asked
falteringly
the
rich
color
coming
and
going
on
her
face
and
her
heart
beating
violently
as
she
put
the
question
his
eyes
flashed
this
he
answered
the
close
and
pernicious
enthralment
of
a
woman
i
never
met
till
the
night
before
last
a
woman
whose
face
haunts
me
a
woman
who
drags
me
to
her
side
with
the
force
of
a
magnet
there
to
grovel
like
a
fool
and
plead
with
her
for
a
love
which
i
already
know
is
poison
to
my
soul
helen
helen
you
do
not
understand
you
will
never
understand
here
in
the
very
air
i
breathe
i
fancy
i
can
trace
the
perfume
she
shakes
from
her
garments
as
she
moves
something
indescribably
fascinating
yet
terrible
attracts
me
to
her
it
is
an
evil
attraction
i
know
but
i
can
not
resist
it
there
is
something
wicked
in
every
man
nature
i
am
conscious
enough
that
there
is
something
detestably
wicked
in
mine
and
i
have
not
sufficient
goodness
to
overbalance
it
and
this
woman
this
silent
gliding
creature
that
has
suddenly
taken
possession
of
my
fancy
she
overcomes
me
in
spite
of
myself
she
makes
havoc
of
all
the
good
intentions
of
my
life
i
admit
it
i
confess
it
you
are
speaking
of
the
princess
ziska
asked
helen
tremblingly
of
whom
else
should
i
speak
he
responded
dreamily
there
is
no
one
like
her
probably
there
never
was
anyone
like
her
except
perhaps
as
the
name
passed
his
lips
he
sprang
hastily
up
and
stood
amazed
as
though
some
sudden
voice
had
called
him
helen
murray
looked
at
him
in
alarm
oh
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
he
forced
a
laugh
nothing
nothing
but
a
madness
i
suppose
it
is
all
a
part
of
my
strange
malady
your
brother
is
stricken
with
the
same
fever
surely
you
know
that
indeed
i
do
know
it
helen
answered
to
my
sorrow
he
regarded
her
intently
her
face
in
its
pure
outline
and
quiet
sadness
of
expression
touched
him
more
than
he
cared
to
own
even
to
himself
my
dear
helen
he
said
with
an
effort
at
composure
i
have
been
talking
wildly
you
must
forgive
me
do
think
about
me
at
all
i
am
not
worth
it
denzil
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
quarrel
with
me
on
account
of
the
princess
ziska
but
i
assure
you
i
will
not
quarrel
with
him
he
is
infatuated
and
so
am
i
the
best
thing
for
all
of
us
to
do
would
be
to
leave
egypt
instantly
i
feel
that
instinctively
only
we
can
not
do
it
something
holds
us
here
you
will
never
persuade
denzil
to
go
and
i
i
can
not
persuade
myself
to
go
there
is
a
clinging
sweetness
in
the
air
for
me
and
there
are
vague
suggestions
memories
dreams
histories
wonderful
things
which
hold
me
i
wish
i
could
analyze
them
recognize
them
or
understand
them
but
i
can
not
and
there
perhaps
is
their
secret
charm
only
one
thing
grieves
me
and
that
is
that
i
have
perhaps
unwittingly
in
some
thoughtless
way
given
you
pain
is
it
so
helen
she
rose
quickly
and
with
a
quiet
dignity
held
out
her
hand
no
monsieur
gervase
she
said
it
is
not
so
i
am
not
one
of
those
women
who
take
every
little
idle
word
said
by
men
in
jest
au
grand
serieux
you
have
always
been
a
kind
and
courteous
friend
and
if
you
ever
fancied
you
had
a
warmer
feeling
for
me
as
you
say
i
am
sure
you
were
mistaken
we
often
delude
ourselves
in
these
matters
i
wish
for
your
sake
i
could
think
the
princess
ziska
worthy
of
the
love
she
so
readily
inspires
but
i
can
not
my
brother
infatuation
for
her
is
to
me
terrible
i
feel
it
will
break
his
heart
and
mine
a
little
half
sob
caught
her
breath
and
interrupted
her
she
paused
but
presently
went
on
with
an
effort
at
calmness
you
talk
of
our
leaving
egypt
how
i
wish
that
were
possible
but
i
spoke
to
denzil
about
it
on
the
night
of
the
ball
and
he
was
furious
with
me
for
the
mere
suggestion
it
seems
like
an
evil
fate
it
is
an
evil
fate
said
gervase
gloomily
enfin
my
dear
helen
we
can
not
escape
from
it
at
least
can
not
but
i
never
was
intended
for
good
things
not
even
for
a
lasting
love
a
lasting
love
i
feel
would
bore
me
you
look
amazed
you
believe
in
lasting
love
so
do
many
sweet
women
but
do
you
know
what
symbol
i
as
an
artist
would
employ
were
i
asked
to
give
my
idea
of
love
on
my
canvas
helen
smiled
sadly
and
shook
her
head
i
would
paint
a
glowing
flame
said
gervase
dreamily
a
flame
leaping
up
from
the
pit
of
hell
to
the
height
of
heaven
springing
in
darkness
lost
in
light
and
flying
into
the
centre
of
that
flame
should
be
a
white
moth
a
blind
soft
mad
thing
with
beating
tremulous
wings
that
should
be
love
whirled
into
the
very
heart
of
the
ravening
fire
crushed
shrivelled
out
of
existence
in
one
wild
rushing
rapture
that
is
what
love
must
be
to
me
one
can
not
prolong
passion
over
fifty
years
more
or
less
of
commonplace
routine
as
marriage
would
have
us
do
the
very
notion
is
absurd
love
is
like
a
choice
wine
of
exquisite
bouquet
and
intoxicating
flavor
it
is
the
most
maddening
draught
in
the
world
but
you
can
not
drink
it
every
day
no
my
dear
helen
i
am
not
made
for
a
quiet
life
nor
for
a
long
one
i
fancy
his
voice
unconsciously
sank
into
a
melancholy
tone
and
for
one
moment
helen
composure
nearly
gave
way
she
loved
him
as
true
women
love
with
that
sublime
which
only
desires
the
happiness
of
the
thing
beloved
yet
a
kind
of
insensate
rage
stirred
for
once
in
her
gentle
soul
to
think
that
the
mere
sight
of
a
strange
woman
with
dark
eyes
a
woman
whom
no
one
knew
anything
about
and
who
was
by
some
people
deemed
a
mere
adventuress
should
have
so
overwhelmed
this
man
whose
genius
she
had
deemed
superior
to
fleeting
impressions
controlling
the
tears
that
rose
to
her
eyes
and
threatened
to
fall
she
said
gently
monsieur
gervase
he
started
as
from
a
reverie
helen
some
day
you
will
think
kindly
of
me
again
i
think
kindly
of
you
now
she
answered
tremulously
then
not
trusting
herself
to
say
any
more
she
turned
swiftly
and
left
him
the
flame
and
the
moth
he
mused
watching
her
slight
figure
till
it
had
disappeared
yes
it
is
the
only
fitting
symbol
love
must
be
always
so
sudden
impetuous
ungovernable
and
then
the
end
to
stretch
out
the
divine
passion
over
breakfasts
and
dinners
it
would
be
intolerable
to
me
lord
fulkeward
could
do
that
sort
of
thing
his
chest
is
narrow
and
his
sentiments
are
as
limited
as
his
chest
he
would
duly
kiss
his
wife
every
morning
and
evening
and
he
would
not
analyze
the
fact
that
no
special
thrill
of
joy
stirred
in
him
at
the
action
what
should
he
do
with
thrills
of
joy
this
poor
fulkeward
and
yet
it
is
likely
he
will
marry
helen
or
will
it
be
the
courtney
animal
the
type
of
man
whose
one
idea
is
arise
kill
and
eat
ah
well
and
he
sighed
she
is
not
for
me
this
maiden
grace
of
womanhood
if
i
married
her
i
should
make
her
miserable
i
am
made
for
passion
not
for
peace
he
started
as
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
turning
saw
dean
the
worthy
little
savant
looked
worried
and
preoccupied
i
have
had
a
letter
from
the
princess
ziska
he
said
without
any
preliminary
she
has
gone
to
secures
rooms
at
the
mena
house
hotel
which
is
situated
close
to
the
pyramids
she
regrets
she
can
not
enter
into
the
idea
of
taking
a
trip
up
the
nile
she
has
no
time
she
says
as
she
is
soon
leaving
cairo
but
she
suggests
that
we
should
make
up
a
party
for
the
mena
house
while
she
is
staying
there
as
she
can
so
she
tells
me
make
the
pyramids
much
more
interesting
for
us
by
her
intimate
knowledge
of
them
now
to
me
this
is
a
very
tempting
offer
but
i
should
not
care
to
go
alone
the
murrays
will
go
i
am
sure
murmured
gervase
lazily
at
any
rate
denzil
will
the
doctor
looked
at
him
narrowly
if
denzil
goes
so
will
you
go
he
said
thus
there
are
two
already
booked
for
company
and
i
fancy
the
fulkewards
might
like
the
idea
the
princess
is
leaving
cairo
queried
gervase
presently
as
though
it
were
an
after
thought
so
she
informs
me
in
her
letter
the
party
which
is
to
come
off
on
wednesday
night
is
her
last
reception
gervase
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
have
you
told
denzil
not
yet
better
do
so
then
and
gervase
glanced
up
at
the
sky
now
glowing
red
with
a
fiery
sunset
he
wants
to
propose
you
know
good
god
cried
the
doctor
sharply
if
he
proposes
to
that
woman
why
should
he
not
demanded
gervase
is
she
not
as
ripe
for
love
and
fit
for
marriage
as
any
other
of
her
sex
her
sex
echoed
the
doctor
grimly
her
sex
there
for
sake
do
talk
to
me
leave
me
alone
the
princess
ziska
is
like
no
woman
living
she
has
none
of
the
sentiments
of
a
woman
and
the
notion
of
denzil
being
such
a
fool
as
to
think
of
proposing
to
her
oh
leave
me
alone
i
tell
you
let
me
worry
this
out
and
clapping
his
hat
well
down
over
his
eyes
he
began
to
walk
away
in
a
strange
condition
of
excitement
which
he
evidently
had
some
difficulty
in
suppressing
suddenly
however
he
turned
came
back
and
tapped
gervase
smartly
on
the
chest
you
are
the
man
for
the
princess
he
said
impressively
there
is
a
madness
in
you
which
you
call
love
for
her
you
are
her
fitting
mate
not
that
poor
boy
denzil
murray
in
certain
men
and
women
spirit
leaps
to
spirit
note
responds
to
note
and
if
all
the
world
were
to
interpose
its
trumpery
bulk
nothing
could
prevent
such
tumultuous
forces
rushing
together
follow
your
destiny
monsieur
gervase
but
do
not
ruin
another
man
life
on
the
way
follow
your
destiny
complete
it
you
are
bound
to
do
so
but
in
the
havoc
and
wildness
to
come
for
god
sake
let
the
innocent
go
free
he
spoke
with
extraordinary
solemnity
and
gervase
stared
at
him
in
utter
bewilderment
and
perplexity
not
understanding
in
the
least
what
he
meant
but
before
he
could
interpose
a
word
or
ask
a
question
dean
had
gone
chapter
xi
the
next
two
or
three
days
passed
without
any
incident
of
interest
occurring
to
move
the
languid
calm
and
excite
the
fleeting
interest
of
the
fashionable
english
and
european
visitors
who
were
congregated
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
the
anxious
flirtations
of
dolly
and
muriel
chetwynd
lyle
afforded
subjects
of
mirth
to
the
profane
the
wonderfully
youthful
toilettes
of
lady
fulkeward
provided
several
keynotes
from
which
to
strike
frivolous
conversation
and
when
the
great
painter
armand
gervase
actually
made
a
sketch
of
her
ladyship
for
his
own
amusement
and
made
her
look
about
sixteen
and
girlish
at
that
his
popularity
knew
no
bounds
everyone
wanted
to
give
him
a
commission
particularly
the
elderly
fair
and
he
could
have
made
a
fortune
had
he
chosen
after
the
example
set
him
by
the
english
academicians
by
painting
the
portraits
of
ugly
nobodies
who
were
ready
to
pay
any
price
to
be
turned
out
as
handsome
somebodies
but
he
was
too
restless
and
ill
at
ease
to
apply
himself
steadily
to
work
the
glowing
skies
of
egypt
the
picturesque
groups
of
natives
to
be
seen
at
every
turn
the
curious
corners
of
old
cairo
these
made
no
impression
upon
his
mind
at
all
and
when
he
was
alone
he
passed
whole
half
hours
staring
at
the
strange
picture
he
had
made
of
the
princess
ziska
wherein
the
face
of
death
seemed
confronting
him
through
a
mask
of
life
and
he
welcomed
with
a
strong
sense
of
relief
and
expectation
the
evening
of
the
princess
reception
to
which
many
of
the
visitors
in
cairo
had
been
invited
since
a
fortnight
and
which
those
persons
who
always
profess
to
be
in
the
know
even
if
they
are
wallowing
in
ignorance
declared
would
surpass
any
entertainment
ever
given
during
the
cairene
season
the
night
came
at
last
it
was
exceedingly
sultry
but
bright
and
clear
and
the
moon
shone
with
effective
brilliance
on
the
groups
of
people
that
between
nine
and
ten
began
to
throng
the
narrow
street
in
which
the
carved
portal
of
the
princess
ziska
residence
was
the
most
conspicuous
object
lady
chetwynd
lyle
remarkable
for
bad
taste
in
her
dress
and
the
disposal
of
her
diamonds
stared
in
haughty
amazement
at
the
nubian
who
saluted
her
and
her
daughters
with
the
grin
peculiar
to
his
uninviting
cast
of
countenance
and
swept
into
the
courtyard
attended
by
her
husband
with
an
air
as
though
she
imagined
her
presence
gave
the
necessary
flavor
of
good
style
to
the
proceedings
she
was
followed
by
lady
fulkeward
innocently
clad
in
white
and
wearing
a
knot
of
lilies
on
her
left
shoulder
lord
fulkeward
denzil
murray
and
his
sister
helen
also
wore
white
but
though
she
was
in
the
twenties
and
lady
fulkeward
was
in
the
sixties
the
girl
had
so
much
sadness
in
her
face
and
so
much
tragedy
in
her
soft
eyes
that
she
looked
if
anything
older
than
the
old
woman
gervase
and
dean
arrived
together
and
found
themselves
in
a
brilliant
crushing
crowd
of
people
all
of
different
nationalities
and
all
manifesting
a
good
deal
of
impatience
because
they
were
delayed
a
few
minutes
in
an
open
court
where
a
couple
of
stone
lions
with
wings
were
the
only
spectators
of
their
costumes
most
singular
behavior
said
lady
chetwynd
lyle
snorting
and
sniffing
to
keep
us
waiting
outside
like
this
the
princess
has
no
idea
of
european
manners
as
she
spoke
a
sudden
blaze
of
light
flamed
on
the
scene
and
twenty
tall
egyptian
servants
in
white
with
red
turbans
carrying
lighted
torches
and
marching
two
by
two
crossed
the
court
and
by
mute
yet
stately
gestures
invited
the
company
to
follow
and
the
company
did
follow
in
haste
with
scramble
and
rudeness
as
is
the
way
of
european
manners
nowadays
and
presently
having
been
relieved
of
their
cloaks
and
wrappings
stood
startled
and
confounded
in
a
huge
hall
richly
adorned
with
silk
and
cloth
of
gold
hangings
where
between
two
bronze
sphinxes
the
princess
ziska
attired
wonderfully
in
a
dim
pale
rose
color
with
flecks
of
jewels
flashing
from
her
draperies
here
and
there
waited
to
receive
her
guests
like
a
queen
she
stood
behind
her
towered
a
giant
palm
and
at
her
feet
were
strewn
roses
and
on
either
side
of
her
seated
on
the
ground
were
young
girls
gorgeously
clad
and
veiled
to
the
eyes
in
the
egyptian
fashion
and
as
the
staring
heated
and
impetuous
swarm
of
travelling
english
and
americans
came
face
to
face
with
her
in
her
marvellous
beauty
they
were
for
the
moment
stricken
spellbound
and
could
scarcely
summon
up
the
necessary
assurance
to
advance
and
take
the
hand
she
outstretched
to
them
in
welcome
she
appeared
not
to
see
the
general
embarrassment
and
greeted
all
who
approached
her
with
courteous
ease
and
composure
speaking
the
few
words
which
every
graceful
hostess
deems
adequate
before
passing
on
her
visitors
and
presently
music
began
music
wild
and
fantastic
of
a
character
unknown
to
modern
fashionable
ears
yet
strangely
familiar
to
armand
gervase
who
started
at
the
first
sound
of
it
and
seemed
enthralled
that
is
not
an
ordinary
orchestra
said
dean
in
his
ear
the
instruments
are
ancient
and
the
form
of
melody
is
barbaric
gervase
answered
nothing
for
the
princess
ziska
just
then
approached
them
come
into
the
red
saloon
she
said
i
am
persuading
my
guests
to
pass
on
there
i
have
an
old
on
the
walls
which
i
would
like
you
to
see
you
especially
dr
dean
for
you
are
so
learned
in
antiquities
i
hear
you
are
trying
to
discover
traces
of
araxes
i
am
replied
the
doctor
you
interested
me
very
much
in
his
history
he
was
a
great
man
said
the
princess
slowly
piloting
them
as
she
spoke
without
hurry
and
with
careful
courtesy
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
now
freely
chattering
and
animated
company
much
greater
than
any
of
your
modern
heroes
but
he
had
two
faults
faults
which
frequently
accompany
the
plentitude
of
power
cruelty
and
selfishness
he
betrayed
and
murdered
the
only
woman
that
ever
loved
him
murdered
her
exclaimed
dean
how
oh
it
is
only
a
legend
and
the
princess
smiled
turning
her
dark
eyes
with
a
bewitching
languor
on
gervase
who
for
some
reason
or
other
which
he
could
not
explain
felt
as
if
he
were
walking
in
a
dream
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
chasm
of
nothingness
into
which
he
must
presently
sink
to
utter
destruction
all
these
old
histories
happened
so
long
ago
that
they
are
nothing
but
myths
now
to
the
present
generation
time
does
not
rob
any
incident
of
its
interest
to
me
said
dean
ages
hence
queen
victoria
will
be
as
much
a
doubtful
potentate
as
king
lud
to
the
wise
student
of
things
there
is
no
time
and
no
distance
all
history
from
the
very
beginning
is
like
a
wonderful
chain
in
which
no
link
is
ever
really
broken
and
in
which
every
part
fits
closely
to
the
other
part
though
why
the
chain
should
exist
at
all
is
a
mystery
we
can
not
solve
yet
i
am
quite
certain
that
even
our
late
friend
araxes
has
his
connection
with
the
present
if
only
for
the
reason
that
he
lived
in
the
past
how
do
you
argue
out
that
theory
asked
gervase
with
sudden
interest
how
do
you
argue
it
the
question
is
how
can
you
argue
at
all
about
anything
that
is
so
plain
and
demonstrated
a
fact
the
doctrine
of
evolution
proves
it
everything
that
we
were
once
has
its
part
in
us
now
suppose
if
you
like
that
we
were
originally
no
more
than
shells
on
the
shore
some
remnant
of
the
nature
of
the
shell
must
be
in
us
at
this
moment
nothing
is
lost
nothing
is
wasted
not
even
a
thought
i
carry
my
theories
very
far
pursued
the
doctor
looking
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
silent
companions
as
they
walked
beside
him
through
a
long
corridor
towards
the
red
saloon
which
could
be
seen
brilliantly
lit
up
and
thronged
with
people
very
far
indeed
especially
in
regard
to
matters
of
love
i
maintain
that
if
it
is
decreed
that
the
soul
of
a
man
and
the
soul
of
a
woman
must
meet
must
rush
together
not
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
can
hinder
them
aye
even
if
they
were
for
some
conventional
cause
or
circumstance
themselves
reluctant
to
consummate
their
destiny
it
would
nevertheless
despite
them
be
consummated
for
mark
you
in
some
form
or
other
they
have
rushed
together
before
whether
as
flames
in
the
air
or
twining
leaves
on
a
tree
or
flowers
in
a
field
they
have
felt
the
sweetness
and
fitness
of
each
other
being
in
former
lives
and
the
craving
sense
of
that
sweetness
and
fitness
can
never
be
done
away
with
never
not
as
long
as
this
present
universe
lasts
it
is
a
terrible
thing
continued
the
doctor
in
a
lower
tone
a
terrible
fatality
the
desire
of
love
in
some
cases
it
is
a
curse
in
others
a
divine
and
priceless
blessing
the
results
depend
entirely
on
the
temperaments
of
the
human
creatures
possessed
by
its
fever
when
it
kindles
rises
and
burns
towards
heaven
in
a
steady
flame
of
purity
and
faith
then
it
makes
marriage
the
most
perfect
union
on
earth
the
sweetest
and
most
blessed
companionship
but
when
it
is
a
mere
gust
of
fire
bright
and
fierce
as
the
sudden
leaping
light
of
a
volcano
then
it
withers
everything
at
a
touch
faith
honor
truth
and
dies
into
dull
ashes
in
which
no
spark
remains
to
warm
or
inspire
man
higher
nature
better
death
than
such
a
love
for
it
works
misery
on
earth
but
who
can
tell
what
horrors
it
may
not
create
hereafter
the
princess
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
weird
gleam
in
her
dark
eyes
you
are
right
she
said
it
is
just
the
hereafter
that
men
never
think
of
i
am
glad
you
at
least
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
life
beyond
death
i
am
bound
to
acknowledge
it
returned
the
doctor
inasmuch
as
i
know
it
exists
gervase
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
in
which
there
was
something
of
contempt
you
are
very
much
behind
the
age
doctor
he
remarked
lightly
very
much
behind
indeed
agreed
dean
composedly
the
age
rushes
on
too
rapidly
for
me
and
gives
no
time
to
the
consideration
of
things
by
the
way
i
stop
i
take
breathing
space
in
which
to
think
life
without
thought
is
madness
and
i
desire
to
have
no
part
in
a
mad
age
at
that
moment
they
entered
the
red
saloon
a
stately
apartment
which
was
entirely
modelled
after
the
most
ancient
forms
of
egyptian
architecture
the
centre
of
the
vast
room
was
quite
clear
of
furniture
so
that
the
princess
ziska
guests
went
wandering
up
and
down
to
and
fro
entirely
at
their
ease
without
crush
or
inconvenience
and
congregated
in
corners
for
conversation
though
if
they
chose
they
could
recline
on
low
divans
and
benches
ranged
against
the
walls
and
sheltered
by
tall
palms
and
flowering
exotics
the
music
was
heard
to
better
advantage
here
than
in
the
hall
where
the
company
had
first
been
received
and
as
the
princess
moved
to
a
seat
under
the
pale
green
frondage
of
a
huge
tropical
fern
and
bade
her
two
companions
sit
beside
her
sounds
of
the
wildest
most
melancholy
and
haunting
character
began
to
palpitate
upon
the
air
in
the
mournful
throbbing
fashion
in
which
a
nightingale
sings
when
its
soul
is
burdened
with
love
the
passionate
tremor
that
shakes
the
bird
throat
at
seemed
to
shake
the
unseen
instruments
that
now
discoursed
strange
melody
and
gervase
listening
dreamily
felt
a
curious
contraction
and
aching
at
his
heart
and
a
sense
of
suffocation
in
his
throat
combined
with
an
insatiate
desire
to
seize
in
his
arms
the
mysterious
ziska
with
her
dark
fathomless
eyes
and
slight
yet
voluptuous
form
to
drag
her
to
his
breast
and
crush
her
there
whispering
mine
mine
by
all
the
gods
of
the
past
and
present
mine
who
shall
tear
her
from
me
who
dispute
my
right
to
love
her
ruin
her
murder
her
if
i
choose
she
is
mine
the
i
told
you
of
is
just
above
us
said
the
princess
then
addressing
herself
to
the
doctor
would
you
like
to
examine
it
one
of
the
servants
shall
bring
you
a
lighted
taper
and
by
passing
it
in
front
of
the
sculpture
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
design
better
ah
mr
murray
and
she
smiled
as
she
greeted
denzil
who
just
then
approached
you
are
in
time
to
give
us
your
opinion
i
want
dean
to
see
that
very
old
piece
of
stone
carving
on
the
wall
above
us
it
will
serve
as
a
link
for
him
in
the
history
of
araxes
indeed
murmured
denzil
somewhat
abstractedly
the
princess
glanced
at
his
brooding
face
and
laughed
you
i
know
are
not
interested
at
all
in
old
history
she
went
on
the
past
has
no
attraction
for
you
no
the
present
is
enough
he
replied
with
a
glance
of
mingled
hope
and
passion
she
smiled
and
signing
to
one
of
her
egyptian
attendants
bade
him
bring
a
lighted
taper
he
did
so
and
passed
it
slowly
up
and
down
and
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
large
piece
of
ancient
sculpture
that
occupied
more
than
half
the
wall
while
dean
stood
by
spectacles
on
nose
to
examine
the
carving
as
closely
as
possible
several
other
people
attracted
by
what
was
going
on
paused
to
look
also
and
the
princess
undertook
to
explain
the
scene
depicted
this
piece
of
carving
is
of
the
date
of
the
king
amenhotep
or
amenophis
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
it
represents
the
return
of
the
warrior
araxes
a
favorite
servant
of
the
king
after
some
brilliant
victory
you
see
there
is
the
triumphal
car
in
which
he
rides
drawn
by
winged
horses
and
behind
him
are
the
solar
deities
ra
sikar
tmu
and
osiris
he
is
supposed
to
be
approaching
his
palace
in
triumph
the
gates
are
thrown
open
to
receive
him
and
coming
out
to
meet
him
is
the
chief
favorite
of
his
harem
the
celebrated
dancer
of
that
period
whom
he
afterwards
murdered
you
say
queried
dean
meditatively
yes
he
murdered
her
simply
because
she
loved
him
too
well
and
was
in
the
way
of
his
ambition
there
was
nothing
astonishing
in
his
behavior
not
even
if
you
consider
it
in
the
light
of
modern
times
men
always
murder
morally
if
not
physically
the
women
who
love
them
too
well
you
truly
think
that
asked
denzil
murray
in
a
low
tone
i
not
only
truly
think
it
i
truly
know
it
she
answered
with
a
disdainful
flash
of
her
eyes
of
course
i
speak
of
strong
men
with
strong
passions
they
are
the
only
kind
of
men
women
ever
worship
of
course
a
weak
man
is
different
he
would
probably
not
harm
a
woman
for
the
world
or
give
her
the
least
cause
for
pain
if
he
could
help
it
but
that
sort
of
man
never
becomes
either
an
adept
or
a
master
in
love
araxes
was
probably
both
no
doubt
he
considered
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
slay
what
he
had
grown
weary
of
he
thought
no
more
than
men
of
his
type
think
that
the
taking
of
a
life
demands
a
life
in
exchange
if
not
in
this
world
then
in
the
next
the
group
of
people
near
her
were
all
silent
gazing
with
an
odd
fascination
at
the
quaint
and
figures
above
them
when
all
at
once
dean
taking
the
taper
from
the
hands
of
the
egyptian
servant
held
the
flame
close
to
the
features
of
the
warrior
riding
in
the
car
of
triumph
and
said
slowly
do
you
not
see
a
curious
resemblance
princess
between
this
araxes
and
a
friend
of
ours
here
present
monsieur
armand
gervase
will
you
kindly
step
forward
yes
that
will
do
turn
your
head
slightly
so
yes
now
observe
the
outline
of
the
features
of
araxes
as
carven
in
this
sculpture
thousands
of
years
ago
and
compare
it
with
the
outline
of
the
features
of
our
celebrated
friend
the
greatest
french
artist
of
his
day
am
i
the
only
one
who
perceives
the
remarkable
similarity
of
contour
and
expression
the
princess
made
no
reply
a
smile
crossed
her
lips
but
no
word
escaped
them
several
persons
however
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
look
at
and
comment
upon
what
was
indeed
a
startling
likeness
the
same
straight
fierce
brows
the
same
proud
firm
mouth
the
same
eyes
were
as
it
seemed
copied
from
the
ancient
entablature
and
repeated
in
flesh
and
blood
in
the
features
of
gervase
even
denzil
murray
absorbed
though
he
was
in
conflicting
thoughts
of
his
own
was
struck
by
the
coincidence
it
is
really
very
remarkable
he
said
allowing
for
the
peculiar
style
of
drawing
and
design
common
to
ancient
egypt
the
portrait
of
araxes
might
pass
for
gervase
in
egyptian
costume
gervase
himself
was
silent
some
mysterious
emotion
held
him
mute
and
he
was
only
aware
of
a
vague
irritation
that
fretted
him
without
any
seemingly
adequate
cause
dean
meanwhile
pursued
his
investigations
with
the
lighted
taper
and
presently
turning
round
on
the
assembled
little
group
of
bystanders
he
said
i
have
just
discovered
another
singular
thing
the
face
of
the
woman
here
the
dancer
and
favorite
is
the
face
of
our
charming
hostess
the
princess
ziska
exclamations
of
wonder
greeted
this
announcement
and
everybody
craned
their
necks
to
see
and
then
the
princess
spoke
slowly
and
languidly
yes
she
murmured
i
was
hoping
you
would
perceive
that
i
myself
noticed
how
very
like
me
is
the
famous
and
that
is
just
why
i
dressed
in
her
fashion
for
the
fancy
ball
the
other
evening
it
seemed
to
me
the
best
thing
to
do
as
i
wanted
to
choose
an
ancient
period
and
then
you
know
i
bear
half
her
name
dean
looked
at
her
keenly
and
a
somewhat
grim
smile
wrinkled
his
lips
you
could
not
have
done
better
he
declared
you
and
the
of
araxes
might
be
twin
sisters
he
lowered
the
taper
he
held
that
it
might
more
strongly
illumine
her
face
and
as
the
outline
of
her
head
and
throat
and
bust
was
thrown
into
full
relief
gervase
staring
at
her
was
again
conscious
of
that
sudden
painful
emotion
of
familiarity
which
had
before
overwhelmed
him
and
he
felt
that
in
all
the
world
he
had
no
such
intimate
knowledge
of
any
woman
as
he
had
of
ziska
he
knew
her
ah
how
did
he
not
know
her
every
curve
of
that
pliant
form
was
to
him
the
living
memory
of
something
once
possessed
and
loved
and
he
pressed
his
hand
heavily
across
his
eyes
for
a
moment
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
all
the
exquisite
voluptuous
grace
which
shook
his
and
tempted
him
almost
beyond
man
mortal
endurance
are
you
not
well
monsieur
gervase
said
dean
observing
him
closely
and
handing
back
the
lighted
taper
to
the
egyptian
servant
who
waited
to
receive
it
the
portraits
on
this
old
carving
have
perhaps
affected
you
unpleasantly
yet
there
is
really
nothing
of
importance
in
such
a
coincidence
nothing
of
importance
perhaps
but
surely
something
of
singularity
interrupted
denzil
murray
especially
in
the
resemblance
between
the
princess
and
the
of
that
ancient
period
their
features
are
positively
line
for
line
alike
the
princess
laughed
yes
is
it
not
curious
she
said
and
taking
the
taper
from
her
servant
she
sprang
lightly
on
one
of
the
benches
near
the
wall
and
leaned
her
beautiful
head
on
the
entablature
so
that
her
profile
stood
out
close
against
that
of
the
once
reputed
we
are
as
dean
says
twins
several
of
the
guests
had
now
gathered
together
in
that
particular
part
of
the
room
and
they
all
looked
up
at
her
as
she
stood
thus
in
silent
and
somewhat
superstitious
wonderment
the
fascinating
dancer
famed
in
ages
past
and
the
lovely
living
charmeresse
of
the
present
were
the
image
of
each
other
and
so
extraordinary
was
the
resemblance
that
it
was
almost
what
some
folks
would
term
uncanny
the
fair
ziska
did
not
however
give
her
acquaintances
time
for
much
meditation
or
surprise
concerning
the
matter
for
she
soon
came
down
from
her
elevation
near
the
sculptured
frieze
and
extinguishing
the
taper
she
held
she
said
lightly
as
dean
has
remarked
there
is
really
nothing
of
importance
in
the
coincidence
ages
ago
in
the
time
of
araxes
roses
must
have
bloomed
and
who
shall
say
that
a
rose
in
garden
is
not
precisely
the
same
in
size
scent
and
color
as
one
that
araxes
himself
plucked
at
his
palace
gates
thus
if
flowers
are
born
alike
in
different
ages
why
not
women
and
men
very
well
argued
princess
said
the
doctor
i
quite
agree
with
you
nature
is
bound
to
repeat
some
of
her
choicest
patterns
lest
she
should
forget
the
art
of
making
them
there
was
now
a
general
movement
among
the
guests
that
particular
kind
of
movement
which
means
irritability
and
restlessness
and
implies
that
either
supper
must
be
immediately
served
or
else
some
novel
entertainment
be
brought
in
to
distract
attention
and
prevent
tedium
the
princess
turning
to
gervase
said
smilingly
apropos
of
the
of
araxes
and
the
art
of
dancing
generally
i
am
going
to
entertain
the
company
presently
by
letting
them
see
a
real
old
dance
of
thebes
if
you
will
excuse
me
a
moment
i
must
just
prepare
them
and
get
the
rooms
slightly
cleared
i
will
return
to
you
presently
she
glided
away
with
her
usual
noiseless
grace
and
within
a
few
minutes
of
her
departure
the
gay
crowds
began
to
fall
back
against
the
walls
and
disperse
themselves
generally
in
expectant
groups
here
and
there
the
egyptian
servants
moving
in
and
out
and
evidently
informing
them
of
the
entertainment
in
prospect
well
i
shall
stay
here
said
dean
underneath
this
remarkable
stone
carving
of
your
monsieur
gervase
you
seem
very
much
abstracted
i
asked
you
before
if
you
were
not
well
but
you
never
answered
me
i
am
perfectly
well
replied
gervase
with
some
irritation
the
heat
is
rather
trying
that
is
all
but
i
attach
no
importance
to
that
stone
frieze
one
can
easily
imagine
likenesses
where
there
are
really
none
true
and
the
doctor
smiled
to
himself
and
said
no
more
just
then
a
wild
burst
of
music
sounded
suddenly
through
the
apartment
and
he
turned
round
in
lively
anticipation
to
watch
the
proceedings
the
middle
of
the
room
was
now
quite
clear
and
presently
moving
with
the
silent
grace
of
swans
on
still
water
came
four
girls
closely
veiled
carrying
harps
and
lutes
a
nubian
servant
followed
them
and
spread
a
carpet
upon
the
ground
whereon
they
all
sat
down
and
began
to
thrum
the
strings
of
their
instruments
in
a
muffled
dreamy
manner
playing
a
music
which
had
nothing
of
melody
in
it
and
which
yet
vaguely
suggested
a
passionate
tune
this
thrumming
went
on
for
some
time
when
all
at
once
from
a
side
entrance
in
the
hall
a
bright
apparently
winged
thing
bounded
from
the
outer
darkness
into
the
centre
of
the
hall
a
woman
clad
in
glistening
cloth
of
gold
and
veiled
entirely
in
misty
folds
of
white
who
raising
her
arms
gleaming
with
jewelled
bangles
high
above
her
head
remained
poised
on
tiptoe
for
a
moment
as
though
about
to
fly
her
bare
feet
white
and
dimpled
sparkled
with
gems
and
glittering
anklets
her
skirts
as
she
moved
showed
fluttering
flecks
of
white
and
pink
like
the
leaves
of
shaken
by
a
summer
breeze
the
music
grew
louder
and
wilder
and
a
brazen
clang
from
unseen
cymbals
prepared
her
as
it
seemed
for
flight
she
began
her
dance
slowly
gliding
mysteriously
from
side
to
side
anon
turning
suddenly
with
her
head
lifted
as
though
listening
for
some
word
of
love
which
should
recall
her
or
command
then
bending
down
again
she
seemed
to
float
lazily
like
a
creature
that
was
dancing
in
a
dream
without
conscious
knowledge
of
her
actions
the
brazen
cymbals
clashed
again
and
then
with
a
wild
beautiful
movement
like
that
of
a
hunted
stag
leaping
the
brow
of
a
hill
the
dancer
sprang
forward
turned
pirouetted
and
tossed
herself
round
and
round
giddily
with
a
marvellous
and
exquisite
celerity
as
if
she
were
nothing
but
a
bright
circle
of
gold
spinning
in
clear
ether
spontaneous
applause
broke
forth
from
every
part
of
the
hall
the
guests
crowded
forward
staring
and
almost
breathless
with
amazement
dean
got
up
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
clapping
his
hands
involuntarily
and
gervase
every
nerve
in
his
body
quivering
advanced
one
or
two
steps
feeling
that
he
must
stop
this
bright
wild
wanton
thing
in
her
incessant
whirling
or
else
die
in
the
hunger
of
love
which
consumed
his
soul
denzil
murray
glanced
at
him
and
after
a
pause
left
his
side
and
disappeared
suddenly
with
a
quick
movement
the
dancer
loosened
her
golden
dress
and
misty
veil
and
tossing
them
aside
like
falling
leaves
she
stood
confessed
a
marvellous
glowing
vision
in
silvery
other
than
the
princess
ziska
shouts
echoed
from
every
part
of
the
hall
ziska
ziska
and
at
the
name
lady
chetwynd
lyle
rose
in
all
her
majesty
from
the
seat
she
had
occupied
till
then
and
in
tones
of
virtuous
indignation
said
to
lady
fulkeward
i
told
you
the
princess
was
not
a
proper
person
now
it
is
proved
i
am
right
to
think
i
should
have
brought
dolly
and
muriel
here
i
shall
really
never
forgive
myself
come
sir
chetwynd
let
us
leave
this
place
instantly
and
stout
sir
chetwynd
gloating
on
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
princess
ziska
form
as
she
still
danced
on
in
her
snowy
white
attire
her
lovely
face
alight
with
mirth
at
the
surprise
she
had
made
for
her
guests
tried
his
best
to
look
sanctimonious
and
signally
failed
in
the
attempt
as
he
answered
certainly
certainly
my
dear
most
improper
most
astonishing
while
lady
fulkeward
answered
innocently
is
it
do
you
really
think
so
oh
dear
i
suppose
it
is
improper
it
must
be
you
know
but
it
is
most
delightful
and
original
and
while
the
chetwynd
lyles
thus
moved
to
depart
in
a
cloud
of
outraged
propriety
followed
by
others
who
likewise
thought
it
well
to
pretend
to
be
shocked
at
the
proceeding
gervase
dizzy
breathless
and
torn
by
such
conflicting
passions
as
he
could
never
express
was
in
a
condition
more
mad
than
sane
my
god
he
muttered
under
his
breath
this
this
is
love
this
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
life
to
possess
her
to
hold
her
in
my
arms
heart
to
heart
lips
to
lips
this
is
what
all
the
eternal
forces
of
nature
meant
when
they
made
me
man
and
he
watched
with
strained
passionate
eyes
the
movements
of
the
princess
ziska
as
they
grew
slower
and
slower
till
she
seemed
floating
merely
like
a
on
a
wave
and
then
from
some
unseen
quarter
of
the
room
a
rich
throbbing
voice
began
to
sing
oh
for
the
passionless
peace
of
the
it
floats
in
a
waking
dream
on
the
waters
chilly
with
its
leaves
unfurled
to
the
wondering
world
knowing
naught
of
the
sorrow
and
restless
pain
that
burns
and
tortures
the
human
brain
oh
for
the
passionless
peace
of
the
oh
for
the
pure
cold
heart
of
the
bared
to
the
moon
on
the
waters
dark
and
chilly
a
star
above
is
its
only
love
and
one
brief
sigh
of
its
scented
breath
is
all
it
will
ever
know
of
death
oh
for
the
pure
cold
heart
of
the
as
the
sound
died
away
in
a
sigh
rather
than
a
note
the
princess
ziska
dancing
ceased
altogether
a
shout
of
applause
broke
from
all
assembled
and
in
the
midst
of
it
there
was
a
sudden
commotion
and
excitement
and
dean
was
seen
bending
over
a
man
prostrate
figure
the
great
french
painter
armand
gervase
had
suddenly
fainted
chapter
xii
a
curious
yet
very
general
feeling
of
superstitious
uneasiness
and
discomfort
pervaded
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
the
day
after
the
princess
ziska
reception
something
had
happened
and
no
one
knew
what
the
proprieties
had
been
outraged
but
no
one
knew
why
it
was
certainly
not
the
custom
for
a
hostess
and
a
princess
to
boot
to
dance
like
a
wild
bacchante
before
a
crowd
of
her
invited
guests
yet
as
dean
blandly
observed
where
was
the
harm
in
london
ladies
of
good
birth
and
breeding
went
in
for
and
no
one
presumed
to
breathe
a
word
against
their
reputations
why
in
cairo
should
not
a
lady
go
in
for
a
theban
dance
without
being
considered
improper
why
indeed
there
seemed
no
adequate
reason
for
being
either
surprised
or
offended
yet
surprised
and
offended
most
people
were
and
scandal
ran
rife
and
rumor
wagged
all
its
poisonous
tongues
to
spread
evil
reports
against
the
princess
ziska
name
and
fame
till
denzil
murray
maddened
and
furious
rushed
up
to
his
sister
in
her
room
and
swore
that
he
would
marry
the
princess
if
he
died
for
it
they
are
blackguarding
her
downstairs
the
beasts
he
said
hotly
they
are
calling
her
by
every
bad
name
under
the
sun
but
i
will
make
everything
straight
for
her
she
shall
be
my
wife
if
she
will
have
me
i
will
marry
her
helen
looked
at
him
in
speechless
despair
oh
denzil
she
faltered
and
then
could
say
no
more
for
the
tears
that
blinded
her
eyes
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
what
you
mean
he
continued
marching
up
and
down
the
room
excitedly
you
are
like
all
the
others
you
think
her
an
adventuress
i
think
her
the
purest
the
noblest
of
women
there
is
where
we
differ
i
spoke
to
her
last
night
i
told
her
i
loved
her
you
did
and
helen
gazed
at
him
with
wet
tragic
eyes
and
she
she
bade
me
be
silent
she
told
me
i
must
not
speak
not
yet
she
said
she
would
give
me
her
answer
when
we
were
all
together
at
the
mena
house
hotel
you
intend
to
be
one
of
the
party
there
then
said
helen
faintly
of
course
i
do
and
so
do
you
i
hope
no
denzil
i
can
not
do
ask
me
i
will
stay
here
with
lady
fulkeward
she
is
not
going
nor
are
the
chetwynd
lyles
i
shall
be
quite
safe
with
them
i
would
rather
not
go
to
the
mena
house
i
could
not
bear
it
her
voice
gave
way
entirely
and
she
broke
out
crying
bitterly
denzil
stood
still
and
regarded
her
with
a
kind
of
sullen
shame
and
remorse
what
a
very
sympathetic
sister
you
are
he
observed
when
you
see
me
madly
in
love
with
a
woman
a
perfectly
beautiful
adorable
woman
you
put
yourself
at
once
in
the
way
and
make
out
that
my
marriage
with
her
will
be
a
misery
to
you
you
surely
do
not
expect
me
to
remain
single
all
my
life
do
you
no
denzil
sobbed
helen
but
i
had
hoped
to
see
you
marry
some
sweet
girl
of
our
own
land
who
would
be
your
dear
and
true
companion
who
would
be
a
sister
to
me
who
there
do
mind
me
be
happy
in
your
own
way
my
dear
brother
i
have
no
business
to
interfere
i
can
only
say
that
if
the
princess
ziska
consents
to
marry
you
i
will
do
my
best
to
like
her
for
your
sake
well
that
something
at
any
rate
said
denzil
with
an
air
of
relief
do
cry
helen
it
bothers
me
as
for
the
girl
you
have
got
in
view
for
me
you
will
permit
me
to
say
that
are
becoming
uncommonly
scarce
in
britain
what
with
bicycle
riders
and
great
rough
tomboys
generally
with
large
hands
and
larger
feet
i
confess
i
do
not
care
about
them
i
like
a
womanly
woman
a
graceful
woman
a
fascinating
bewitching
woman
and
the
princess
is
all
that
and
more
surely
you
consider
her
beautiful
very
beautiful
indeed
sighed
poor
too
beautiful
nonsense
as
if
any
woman
can
be
too
beautiful
i
am
sorry
you
come
to
the
mena
house
it
would
be
a
change
for
you
and
gervase
is
going
is
he
better
inquired
helen
timidly
oh
i
believe
he
is
quite
well
again
it
was
the
heat
or
the
scent
of
the
flowers
or
something
of
that
sort
that
made
him
faint
last
night
he
is
not
acclimatized
yet
you
know
and
he
said
that
the
dancing
made
him
giddy
i
do
wonder
at
that
murmured
helen
it
was
marvellous
glorious
said
denzil
dreamily
it
was
like
nothing
else
ever
seen
or
imagined
if
she
were
your
wife
would
you
care
for
her
to
dance
before
people
inquired
helen
tremblingly
denzil
turned
upon
her
in
haughty
wrath
how
like
a
woman
that
is
to
insinuate
a
nasty
suggestion
to
imply
an
innuendo
without
uttering
it
if
she
were
my
wife
she
would
do
nothing
unbecoming
that
position
then
you
did
think
it
a
little
unbecoming
persisted
helen
no
i
did
not
said
denzil
sharply
an
independent
woman
may
do
many
things
that
a
married
woman
may
not
marriage
brings
its
own
duties
and
responsibilities
time
enough
to
consider
them
when
they
come
he
turned
angrily
on
his
heel
and
left
her
and
helen
burying
her
fair
face
in
her
hands
wept
long
and
unrestrainedly
this
strange
woman
out
of
egypt
had
turned
her
brother
heart
against
her
and
stolen
away
her
almost
declared
lover
it
was
no
wonder
that
her
tears
fell
fast
wrung
from
her
with
the
pain
of
this
double
wound
for
helen
though
quiet
and
undemonstrative
had
fine
feelings
and
unsounded
depths
of
passion
in
her
nature
and
the
fatal
attraction
she
felt
for
armand
gervase
was
more
powerful
than
she
had
herself
known
now
that
he
had
openly
confessed
his
infatuation
for
another
woman
it
seemed
as
though
the
earth
had
opened
at
her
feet
and
shown
her
nothing
but
a
grave
in
which
to
fall
life
empty
and
blank
and
bare
of
love
and
tenderness
stretched
before
her
imagination
she
saw
herself
toiling
along
the
monotonously
even
road
of
duty
till
her
hair
became
gray
and
her
face
thin
and
wan
and
wrinkled
and
never
a
gleam
again
of
the
beautiful
glowing
romantic
passion
that
for
a
short
time
had
made
her
days
splendid
with
the
dreams
that
are
sweeter
than
all
realities
poor
helen
it
was
little
marvel
that
she
wept
as
all
women
weep
when
their
hearts
are
broken
it
is
so
easy
to
break
a
heart
sometimes
a
mere
word
will
do
it
but
the
vanishing
of
the
winged
from
the
soul
is
even
more
than
it
is
utter
and
irretrievable
loss
complete
and
dominating
chaos
out
of
which
no
good
thing
can
ever
be
designed
or
created
in
our
days
we
do
our
best
to
supply
the
place
of
a
reluctant
eros
by
the
gilded
grinning
which
we
try
to
consider
as
superior
to
any
god
that
ever
descended
in
his
rainbow
car
to
sing
heavenly
songs
to
mortals
but
it
is
an
unlovely
substitute
a
hideous
idol
at
best
and
grasp
its
golden
knees
and
worship
it
as
we
will
it
gives
us
little
or
no
comfort
in
the
hours
of
strong
temptation
or
trouble
we
have
made
a
mistake
we
in
our
progressive
generation
we
have
banished
the
old
sweetnesses
triumphs
and
delights
of
life
and
we
have
got
in
exchange
steam
and
electricity
but
the
heart
of
the
age
clamors
on
unsatisfied
none
of
our
new
ideas
content
it
nothing
pacifies
its
restless
yearning
it
feels
this
great
heart
of
human
life
that
it
is
losing
more
than
it
gains
hence
the
incessant
restless
aching
of
the
time
and
the
perpetual
longing
for
something
science
can
not
teach
something
vague
beautiful
indefinable
yet
satisfying
to
every
pulse
of
the
soul
and
the
nearest
emotion
to
that
divine
solace
is
what
we
in
our
higher
and
better
moments
recognize
as
love
and
love
was
lost
to
helen
murray
the
choice
pearl
had
fallen
in
the
vast
gulf
of
and
not
all
the
forces
of
nature
would
ever
restore
to
her
that
priceless
gem
and
while
she
wept
to
herself
in
solitude
and
her
brother
denzil
wandered
about
in
the
gardens
of
the
hotel
encouraging
within
himself
hopes
of
winning
the
bewitching
ziska
for
a
wife
armand
gervase
shut
up
in
his
room
under
plea
of
slight
indisposition
reviewed
the
emotions
of
the
past
night
and
tired
to
analyze
them
some
men
are
born
and
are
able
to
dissect
their
feelings
by
some
peculiar
form
of
mental
surgery
which
finally
leads
them
to
cut
out
tenderness
as
though
it
were
a
cancer
love
as
a
disease
and
romantic
aspirations
as
mere
uncomfortable
growths
injurious
to
but
gervase
was
not
one
of
these
outwardly
he
assumed
more
or
less
the
composed
and
careless
demeanor
of
the
modern
french
cynic
but
inwardly
the
man
was
a
raging
fire
of
fierce
passions
which
were
sometimes
too
strong
to
be
held
in
check
at
the
present
moment
he
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
everything
even
life
itself
to
obtain
possession
of
the
woman
he
coveted
and
he
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
resist
the
tempest
of
desire
that
was
urging
him
on
with
an
invincible
force
in
a
direction
which
for
some
strange
and
altogether
inexplicable
reason
he
dreaded
yes
there
was
a
dim
sense
of
terror
lurking
behind
all
the
wild
passion
that
filled
his
soul
a
haunting
vague
idea
that
this
sudden
love
with
its
glowing
ardor
and
intoxicating
delirium
was
like
the
brilliant
red
sunset
which
frequently
prognosticates
a
night
of
storm
ruin
and
death
yet
though
he
felt
this
presentiment
like
a
creeping
shudder
of
cold
through
his
blood
it
did
not
hold
him
back
or
for
a
moment
impress
him
with
the
idea
that
it
might
be
better
to
yield
no
further
to
this
desperate
which
enthralled
him
once
only
he
thought
what
if
i
left
egypt
now
at
once
and
saw
her
no
more
and
then
he
laughed
scornfully
at
the
impossibility
proposed
leave
egypt
he
muttered
i
might
as
well
leave
the
world
altogether
she
would
draw
me
back
with
those
sweet
wild
eyes
of
hers
she
would
drag
me
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
fall
at
her
feet
in
a
very
agony
of
love
my
god
she
must
have
her
way
and
do
with
me
as
she
will
for
i
feel
that
she
holds
my
life
in
her
hands
as
he
spoke
these
last
words
half
aloud
he
sprang
up
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
reclining
and
stood
for
a
moment
lost
in
frowning
meditation
my
life
in
her
hands
he
repeated
musingly
yes
it
has
come
to
that
my
life
a
great
sigh
broke
from
him
my
life
my
art
my
work
my
name
in
all
these
things
i
have
taken
pride
and
she
she
can
trample
them
under
her
feet
and
make
of
me
nothing
more
than
man
clamoring
for
woman
love
what
a
wild
world
it
is
what
a
strange
force
must
that
be
which
created
it
the
force
that
some
men
call
god
and
others
devil
a
strange
blind
brute
force
for
it
makes
us
aspire
only
to
fall
it
gives
a
man
dreams
of
ambition
and
splendid
attainment
only
to
fling
him
like
a
mad
fool
on
a
woman
breast
and
bid
him
find
there
and
there
only
the
bewildering
sweetness
which
makes
everything
else
in
existence
poor
and
tame
in
comparison
well
well
my
life
what
is
it
a
mere
grain
of
sand
dropped
in
the
sea
let
her
do
with
it
as
she
will
god
how
i
felt
her
power
upon
me
last
night
last
night
when
her
lithe
figure
swaying
in
the
dance
reminded
me
he
paused
startled
at
the
turn
his
own
thoughts
were
taking
of
what
let
me
try
and
express
to
myself
now
what
i
could
not
express
or
realize
last
night
she
ziska
i
thought
was
mine
mine
from
her
dimpled
feet
to
her
dusky
hair
and
she
danced
for
me
alone
it
seemed
that
the
jewels
she
wore
upon
her
rounded
arms
and
slender
ankles
were
all
from
me
every
circlet
of
gold
every
starry
shining
gem
on
her
fair
body
was
the
symbol
of
some
secret
joy
between
us
joy
so
keen
as
to
be
almost
pain
and
as
she
danced
i
thought
i
was
in
a
vast
hall
of
a
majestic
palace
where
open
colonnades
revealed
wide
glimpses
of
a
burning
desert
and
deep
blue
sky
i
heard
the
distant
sound
of
rolling
drums
and
not
far
off
i
saw
the
sphinx
a
creature
not
old
but
new
resting
upon
a
giant
pedestal
and
guarding
the
sculptured
gate
of
some
great
temple
which
contained
as
i
then
thought
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
i
could
paint
the
picture
as
i
saw
it
then
it
was
a
fleeting
impression
merely
conjured
up
by
the
dance
that
dizzied
my
brain
and
that
song
of
the
that
was
strange
very
strange
for
i
thought
i
had
heard
it
often
before
and
i
saw
myself
in
the
vague
dream
a
prince
a
warrior
almost
a
king
and
far
more
famous
in
the
world
than
i
am
now
he
looked
about
him
uneasily
with
a
kind
of
nervous
terror
and
his
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
easel
where
the
picture
he
had
painted
of
the
princess
was
placed
covered
from
view
by
a
fold
of
dark
cloth
bah
he
exclaimed
at
last
with
a
forced
laugh
what
stupid
fancies
fool
me
it
is
all
the
vague
talk
of
that
learned
ass
dean
with
his
ridiculous
theories
about
life
and
death
i
shall
be
imagining
i
am
his
fad
araxes
next
this
sort
of
thing
will
never
do
let
me
reason
out
the
matter
calmly
i
love
this
woman
love
her
to
absolute
madness
it
is
not
the
best
kind
of
love
maybe
but
it
is
the
only
kind
i
am
capable
of
and
such
as
it
is
she
possesses
it
all
what
then
well
we
go
to
the
pyramids
and
we
join
her
at
the
mena
house
i
and
the
poor
boy
denzil
he
will
try
his
chance
i
mine
if
he
wins
i
shall
kill
him
as
surely
as
i
myself
live
yes
even
though
he
is
helen
brother
no
man
shall
snatch
ziska
from
my
arms
and
continue
to
breathe
if
i
win
it
is
possible
he
may
kill
me
and
i
shall
respect
him
for
trying
to
do
it
but
i
shall
satisfy
my
love
first
ziska
will
be
mine
mine
in
every
sense
of
possession
before
i
die
yes
that
must
be
that
will
have
to
be
and
afterwards
why
let
denzil
do
his
worst
a
man
can
but
die
once
he
drew
the
cloth
off
his
easel
and
stared
at
the
strange
picture
of
the
princess
which
seemed
almost
sentient
in
its
expression
there
is
a
dead
face
and
a
living
one
on
this
canvas
he
said
and
the
dead
face
seems
to
enthral
me
as
much
as
the
living
both
have
the
same
cruel
smile
both
the
same
compelling
magnetism
of
eye
only
it
is
a
singular
thing
that
i
should
know
the
dead
face
even
more
intimately
than
the
living
that
the
tortured
look
upon
it
should
be
a
kind
of
haunting
memory
horrible
ghastly
he
flung
the
cloth
over
the
easel
again
impatiently
and
tried
to
laugh
at
his
own
morbid
imagination
i
know
who
is
responsible
for
all
this
nonsense
he
said
it
is
that
ridiculous
little
faddist
dean
he
is
going
to
the
mena
house
too
well
he
will
be
the
witness
of
a
comedy
or
a
tragedy
there
and
heaven
alone
knows
which
it
will
be
and
to
distract
his
thoughts
from
dwelling
any
longer
on
the
haunting
ideas
that
perplexed
him
he
took
up
one
of
the
latest
and
frothiest
of
french
novels
and
began
to
read
some
one
in
a
room
not
far
off
was
singing
a
french
song
a
man
with
a
rich
baritone
voice
and
unconsciously
to
himself
gervase
caught
the
words
as
they
rang
out
full
and
clearly
on
the
quiet
heated
air
o

de
tout
and
something
like
a
mist
of
tears
clouded
his
aching
eyes
as
he
repeated
half
mechanically
and
dreamily
o

chapter
xiii
for
the
benefit
of
those
among
the
untravelled
english
who
have
not
yet
broken
a
bottle
against
the
sphinx
or
eaten
sandwiches
to
the
immortal
memory
of
cheops
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
that
the
mena
house
hotel
is
a
long
rambling
roomy
building
situated
within
five
minutes
walk
of
the
great
pyramid
and
happily
possessed
of
a
and
a
marble
that
ubiquitous
nuisance
the
amateur
photographer
can
there
have
his
dark
room
for
the
development
of
his
more
or
less
imperfect
plates
and
there
is
a
resident
chaplain
for
the
piously
inclined
with
a
chaplain
and
a
dark
room
what
more
can
the
aspiring
soul
of
the
modern
tourist
desire
some
of
the
rooms
at
the
mena
house
are
small
and
stuffy
others
large
and
furnished
with
sufficient
elegance
and
the
princess
ziska
had
secured
a
suite
of
the
best
that
could
be
obtained
and
was
soon
installed
there
with
befitting
luxury
she
left
cairo
quite
suddenly
and
without
any
visible
preparation
the
morning
after
the
reception
in
which
she
had
astonished
her
guests
by
her
dancing
and
she
did
not
call
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
to
say
to
any
of
her
acquaintances
there
she
was
perhaps
conscious
that
her
somewhat
free
behavior
had
startled
several
worthy
and
sanctimonious
persons
and
possibly
she
also
thought
that
to
take
rooms
in
an
hotel
which
was
only
an
hour
distance
from
cairo
could
scarcely
be
considered
as
absenting
herself
from
cairene
society
she
was
followed
to
her
desert
retreat
by
dean
armand
gervase
and
denzil
murray
who
drove
to
the
mena
house
together
in
one
carriage
and
were
more
or
less
all
three
in
a
sober
and
meditative
frame
of
mind
they
arrived
in
time
to
see
the
sphinx
bathed
in
the
fierce
glow
of
an
ardent
sunset
which
turned
the
golden
sands
to
crimson
and
made
the
granite
monster
look
like
a
cruel
idol
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
blood
the
brilliant
red
of
the
heavens
flamed
in
its
stony
eyes
and
gave
them
a
sentient
look
as
of
contemplated
murder
and
the
same
radiance
fitfully
playing
on
the
lips
caused
them
to
smile
with
a
seeming
voluptuous
mockery
dean
stood
transfixed
for
a
while
at
the
strange
splendor
of
the
spectacle
and
turning
to
his
two
silent
companions
said
suddenly
there
is
something
after
all
in
the
unguessed
riddle
of
the
sphinx
it
is
not
a
fable
it
is
a
truth
there
is
a
problem
to
be
solved
and
that
monstrous
creature
knows
it
the
woman
face
the
body
spiritualism
and
materialism
in
one
it
is
life
and
more
than
life
it
is
love
forever
and
forever
it
teaches
the
same
wonderful
terrible
mystery
we
aspire
yet
we
fall
love
would
fain
give
us
wings
wherewith
to
fly
but
the
wretched
body
lies
prone
supine
it
can
not
soar
to
the
light
eternal
what
is
the
light
eternal
queried
gervase
moodily
how
do
we
know
it
exists
we
can
not
prove
it
this
world
is
what
we
see
we
have
to
do
with
it
and
ourselves
soul
without
body
could
not
exist
could
it
not
said
the
doctor
how
then
does
body
exist
without
soul
this
was
an
unexpected
but
fair
question
and
gervase
found
himself
curiously
perplexed
by
it
he
offered
no
reply
neither
did
denzil
and
they
all
three
slowly
entered
the
mena
house
hotel
there
to
be
met
with
deferential
salutations
by
the
urbane
and
affable
landlord
and
to
be
assured
that
they
would
find
their
rooms
comfortable
and
also
that
madame
la
princesse
ziska
expected
them
to
dine
with
her
that
evening
at
this
message
denzil
murray
made
a
sign
to
gervase
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
him
alone
gervase
move
aside
with
him
give
me
my
chance
said
denzil
fiercely
take
it
replied
gervase
listlessly
let
witness
the
interchange
of
hearts
between
you
and
the
princess
i
shall
not
interfere
denzil
stared
at
him
in
sullen
astonishment
you
will
not
interfere
your
fancy
for
her
is
at
an
end
gervase
raised
his
dark
glowing
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
his
rival
with
a
strange
and
sombre
expression
my
for
her
my
good
boy
take
care
what
you
say
do
rouse
me
too
far
for
i
am
dangerous
my
for
her
what
do
you
know
of
it
you
are
and
young
but
the
chill
of
the
north
controls
you
in
a
fashion
while
i
a
man
in
the
prime
of
manhood
am
of
the
south
and
the
southern
fire
brooks
no
control
have
you
seen
a
quiet
ocean
smooth
as
glass
with
only
a
dimple
in
the
deep
blue
to
show
that
perhaps
should
occasion
serve
there
might
arise
a
little
wave
and
have
you
seen
the
wild
storm
breaking
from
a
black
cloud
and
suddenly
making
that
quiet
expanse
nothing
but
a
tourbillon
of
furious
elements
in
which
the
very
cry
is
whelmed
and
lost
in
the
thunder
of
the
billows
such
a
storm
as
that
may
be
compared
to
the
you
suppose
i
feel
for
the
woman
who
has
dragged
us
both
here
to
die
at
her
feet
for
that
i
believe
is
what
it
will
come
to
life
is
not
possible
under
the
strain
of
emotion
with
which
we
two
are
living
it
he
broke
off
then
resumed
in
quieter
tones
i
say
to
you
use
your
opportunities
while
you
have
them
after
dinner
i
will
leave
you
alone
with
the
princess
i
will
go
out
for
a
stroll
with
dean
take
your
chance
denzil
for
as
i
live
it
is
your
last
it
will
be
my
turn
next
give
me
credit
for
patience
he
turned
quickly
away
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
denzil
murray
stood
still
for
a
while
thinking
deeply
and
trying
to
review
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
he
was
madly
in
love
with
a
woman
for
whom
his
only
sister
had
the
most
violent
antipathy
and
that
sister
who
had
once
been
all
in
all
to
him
had
now
become
almost
less
than
nothing
in
the
headstrong
passion
which
consumed
him
no
consideration
for
her
peace
and
ultimate
happiness
affected
him
though
he
was
sensible
of
a
certain
remorseful
pity
when
thinking
of
her
gentle
ways
and
docile
yielding
to
his
often
impatient
and
impetuous
humors
but
after
all
she
was
only
his
sister
she
could
not
understand
his
present
condition
of
mind
then
there
was
gervase
whom
he
had
for
some
years
looked
upon
as
one
of
his
most
admired
and
intimate
friends
now
he
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
rival
and
an
enemy
notwithstanding
his
seeming
courtesy
and
civil
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
denzil
was
left
alone
to
face
his
fate
to
dare
the
brilliant
seduction
of
the
witching
eyes
of
ziska
to
win
her
or
to
lose
her
forever
and
consider
every
point
as
he
would
the
weary
conviction
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
whether
he
met
with
victory
or
defeat
the
result
would
bring
more
misery
than
joy
when
he
entered
the
princess
salon
that
evening
he
found
dean
and
gervase
already
there
the
princess
herself
attired
in
a
made
with
quite
a
modern
parisian
elegance
received
him
in
her
usual
graceful
manner
and
expressed
with
much
sweetness
her
hope
that
the
air
of
the
desert
would
prove
beneficial
to
him
after
the
great
heats
that
had
prevailed
in
cairo
nothing
but
conventionalities
were
spoken
oh
those
conventionalities
what
a
world
of
repressed
emotions
they
sometimes
cover
how
difficult
it
is
to
conceive
that
the
man
and
woman
who
are
greeting
each
other
with
calm
courtesy
in
a
crowded
are
the
very
two
who
standing
face
to
face
in
the
moonlit
silence
of
some
lonely
grove
of
trees
or
shaded
garden
once
in
their
lives
suddenly
realized
the
wild
passion
that
neither
dared
confess
tragedies
lie
deepest
under
conventionalities
such
secrets
are
buried
beneath
them
as
sometimes
might
make
the
angels
weep
they
are
safeguards
however
against
stronger
emotions
and
the
strange
bathos
of
two
human
creatures
talking
politely
about
the
weather
when
the
soul
of
each
is
clamoring
for
the
other
has
sometimes
despite
its
absurdity
saved
the
situation
at
dinner
the
princess
ziska
devoted
herself
almost
entirely
to
the
entertainment
of
dean
and
awakened
his
interest
very
keenly
on
the
subject
of
the
great
pyramid
it
has
never
really
been
explored
she
said
the
excavators
who
imagine
they
have
fathomed
its
secrets
are
completely
in
error
the
upper
chambers
are
mere
deceits
to
the
investigator
they
were
built
and
planned
purposely
to
mislead
and
the
secrets
they
hide
have
never
even
been
guessed
at
much
less
discovered
are
you
sure
of
that
inquired
the
doctor
eagerly
if
so
would
you
not
give
your
information
i
neither
give
my
information
nor
sell
it
interrupted
the
princess
smiling
coldly
i
am
only
a
woman
and
women
are
supposed
to
know
nothing
with
the
rest
of
my
sex
i
am
judged
illogical
and
imaginative
you
wise
men
would
call
my
knowledge
of
history
deficient
my
facts
not
proven
but
if
you
like
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
the
construction
of
the
great
pyramid
and
why
it
is
unlikely
that
anyone
will
ever
find
the
treasures
that
are
buried
within
it
you
can
receive
the
narrative
with
the
usual
incredulity
common
to
men
i
shall
not
attempt
to
argue
the
pros
and
cons
with
you
because
i
never
argue
treat
it
as
a
no
woman
is
ever
supposed
to
know
anything
for
a
fact
she
is
too
stupid
only
men
are
wise
her
dark
disdainful
glance
flashed
on
gervase
and
denzil
anon
she
smiled
bewitchingly
and
added
is
it
not
so
wisdom
is
nothing
compared
to
beauty
said
gervase
a
beautiful
woman
can
turn
the
wisest
man
into
a
fool
the
princess
laughed
lightly
yes
and
a
moment
afterwards
he
regrets
his
folly
she
said
he
clamors
for
the
beautiful
woman
as
a
child
might
cry
for
the
moon
and
when
he
at
last
possesses
her
he
tires
satisfied
with
having
compassed
her
degradation
he
exclaims
shall
i
do
with
this
beauty
which
because
it
is
mine
now
palls
upon
me
let
me
kill
it
and
forget
it
i
am
aweary
of
love
and
the
world
is
full
of
women
that
is
the
way
of
your
sex
monsieur
gervase
it
is
a
brutal
way
but
it
is
the
one
most
of
you
follow
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
said
denzil
looking
up
quickly
a
pained
flush
on
his
handsome
face
in
the
hearts
of
women
yes
said
ziska
her
voice
growing
tremulous
with
strange
and
sudden
passion
women
love
ah
with
what
force
and
tenderness
and
utter
abandonment
of
self
but
their
love
is
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
utterly
wasted
it
is
a
largesse
flung
to
the
ungrateful
a
jewel
tossed
in
the
mire
if
there
were
not
some
compensation
in
the
next
life
for
the
ruin
wrought
on
loving
women
the
eternal
god
himself
would
be
a
mockery
and
a
jest
and
is
he
not
queried
gervase
ironically
fair
princess
i
would
not
willingly
shake
your
faith
in
things
unseen
but
what
does
the
god
as
you
call
him
care
as
to
the
destiny
of
any
individual
unit
on
this
globe
of
matter
does
he
interfere
when
the
murderer
knife
descends
upon
the
victim
and
has
he
ever
interfered
he
it
is
who
created
the
sexes
and
placed
between
them
the
strong
attraction
that
often
works
more
evil
and
misery
than
good
and
what
barrier
has
he
ever
interposed
between
woman
and
man
her
natural
destroyer
none
save
the
trifling
one
of
virtue
which
is
a
flimsy
thing
and
often
breaks
down
at
the
first
temptation
no
my
dear
princess
the
god
if
there
is
one
does
nothing
but
look
on
impassively
at
the
universal
havoc
of
creation
and
in
the
blindness
and
silence
of
things
i
can
not
recognize
an
eternal
god
at
all
we
were
evidently
made
to
eat
drink
breed
and
die
and
there
an
end
what
of
ambition
asked
dean
what
of
the
inspiration
that
lifts
a
man
beyond
himself
and
his
material
needs
and
teaches
him
to
strive
after
the
highest
mere
mad
folly
replied
gervase
impetuously
take
the
arts
i
for
example
dream
of
painting
a
picture
that
shall
move
the
world
to
admiration
but
i
seldom
grasp
the
idea
i
have
imagined
i
paint
something
anything
and
the
world
gapes
at
it
and
some
rich
fool
buys
it
leaving
me
free
to
paint
another
something
and
so
on
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
my
career
i
ask
you
what
satisfaction
does
it
bring
what
is
it
to
raphael
that
thousands
of
human
units
cultured
and
silly
have
stared
at
his
and
his
famous
cartoons
well
we
do
not
exactly
know
what
it
may
or
may
not
be
to
raphael
said
the
doctor
meditatively
according
to
my
theories
raphael
is
not
dead
but
merely
removed
into
another
form
on
another
planet
possibly
and
is
working
elsewhere
you
might
as
well
ask
what
it
is
to
araxes
now
that
he
was
a
famous
warrior
once
gervase
moved
uneasily
you
have
got
araxes
on
the
brain
doctor
he
said
with
a
forced
smile
and
in
our
conversation
we
are
forgetting
that
the
princess
has
promised
to
tell
us
a
fairytale
the
story
of
the
great
pyramid
the
princess
looked
at
him
then
at
denzil
murray
and
lastly
at
dean
would
you
really
care
to
hear
it
she
asked
most
certainly
they
all
three
answered
she
rose
from
the
come
here
to
the
window
she
said
you
can
see
the
great
structure
now
in
the
dusky
light
look
at
it
well
and
try
if
you
can
to
realize
that
deep
deep
down
in
the
earth
on
which
it
stands
is
a
connected
gallery
of
rocky
caves
wherein
no
human
foot
has
ever
penetrated
since
the
deluge
swept
over
the
land
and
made
a
desert
of
all
the
civilization
her
slight
figure
appeared
to
dilate
as
she
spoke
raising
one
slender
hand
and
arm
to
point
at
the
huge
mass
that
towered
up
against
the
clear
starlit
sky
her
listeners
were
silent
awed
and
attentive
one
of
the
latest
ideas
concerning
the
pyramids
is
as
you
know
that
they
were
built
as
towers
of
defence
against
the
deluge
that
is
correct
the
wise
men
of
the
old
days
foretold
the
time
when
waters
should
rise
and
cover
the
earth
and
these
huge
monuments
were
prepared
and
raised
to
a
height
which
it
was
estimated
would
always
appear
above
the
level
of
the
coming
flood
to
show
where
the
treasures
of
egypt
were
hidden
for
safety
yes
the
treasures
of
egypt
the
wisdom
the
science
of
egypt
they
are
all
down
there
still
and
there
to
all
intents
and
purposes
they
are
likely
to
remain
but
archaeologists
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
pyramids
have
been
thoroughly
explored
began
dean
with
some
excitement
the
princess
interrupted
him
by
a
slight
gesture
archaeologists
my
dear
doctor
are
like
the
rest
of
this
men
they
work
in
one
groove
and
are
generally
content
with
it
sometimes
an
unusually
brilliant
brain
conceives
the
erratic
notion
of
working
in
several
grooves
and
is
straightway
judged
as
mad
or
fanatic
it
is
when
these
intelligences
sweep
across
the
world
horizon
that
we
hear
of
a
julius
caesar
a
napoleon
a
shakespeare
but
archaeologists
are
the
narrowest
and
dryest
of
men
they
preconceive
a
certain
system
of
work
and
follow
it
out
by
mathematical
rule
and
plan
without
one
touch
of
imagination
to
help
them
to
discover
new
channels
of
interest
or
historical
information
as
i
told
you
before
i
began
to
speak
you
are
welcome
to
entirely
disbelieve
my
story
of
the
great
pyramid
but
as
i
have
begun
it
you
may
as
well
hear
it
through
she
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
according
to
my
information
the
building
of
the
pyramids
was
commenced
three
hundred
years
before
the
deluge
in
the
time
of
saurid
the
son
of
sabaloc
who
it
is
said
was
the
first
to
receive
a
warning
dream
of
the
coming
flood
saurid
being
convinced
by
his
priests
astrologers
and
soothsayers
that
the
portent
was
a
true
one
became
from
that
time
possessed
of
one
idea
which
was
that
the
vast
learning
of
egypt
its
sciences
discoveries
and
strange
traditions
should
not
be
lost
and
that
the
exploits
and
achievements
of
those
who
were
great
and
famous
in
the
land
should
be
so
recorded
as
never
to
be
forgotten
in
those
days
here
where
you
see
these
measureless
tracts
of
sand
there
were
great
mountainous
rocks
and
granite
quarries
and
saurid
utilized
these
for
the
hollowing
out
of
deep
caverns
in
which
to
conceal
treasure
when
these
caverns
were
prepared
to
his
liking
he
caused
a
floor
to
be
made
portions
of
which
were
rendered
movable
by
means
of
secret
springs
and
then
leaving
a
hollow
space
of
some
four
feet
in
height
he
started
foundations
for
another
floor
above
it
this
upper
floor
is
what
you
nowadays
see
when
you
enter
the
pyramid
and
no
one
imagines
that
under
it
is
an
open
space
with
room
to
walk
in
and
yet
another
floor
below
where
everything
of
value
is
secreted
dean
drew
a
long
breath
of
wonderment
astonishing
if
true
the
princess
smiled
somewhat
disdainfully
and
went
on
saurid
work
was
carried
on
after
his
death
by
his
successors
and
with
thousands
of
slaves
toiling
night
and
day
the
pyramids
were
in
the
course
of
years
raised
above
the
caverns
which
concealed
mysteries
everything
was
gradually
accumulated
in
these
underground
the
engraved
talismans
the
slabs
of
stone
on
which
were
deeply
carved
the
geometrical
and
astronomical
sciences
indestructible
glass
chests
containing
papyri
on
which
were
written
the
various
discoveries
made
in
beneficial
drugs
swift
poisons
and
other
medicines
and
among
these
many
things
were
thirty
great
jars
full
of
precious
stones
some
of
which
were
marvels
of
the
earth
they
are
there
still
and
some
of
the
great
men
who
died
were
interred
in
these
caves
every
one
in
a
separate
chamber
inlaid
with
gold
and
gems
and
i
think
here
the
princess
turned
her
dark
eyes
full
on
dean
i
think
that
if
you
knew
the
secret
way
of
lifting
the
apparently
immovable
floor
which
is
like
the
solid
ground
and
descending
through
the
winding
galleries
beneath
it
is
more
than
probable
you
would
find
in
the
great
pyramid
the
tomb
of
araxes
her
eyes
glistened
strangely
in
the
evening
light
with
that
peculiar
fiery
glow
which
had
made
dean
once
describe
them
as
being
like
the
eyes
of
a
and
there
was
something
curiously
impressive
in
her
gesture
as
she
once
more
pointed
to
the
towering
structure
which
loomed
against
the
heavens
with
one
star
flashing
immediately
above
it
a
sudden
involuntary
shudder
shook
gervase
as
with
icy
cold
he
moved
restlessly
and
presently
remarked
well
it
is
a
safe
tomb
at
any
rate
whoever
araxes
was
he
stands
little
chance
of
being
exhumed
if
he
lies
two
floors
below
the
great
pyramid
in
a
rocky
cavern
princess
you
look
like
an
inspired
prophetess
so
much
talk
of
ancient
and
musty
times
makes
me
feel
uncanny
and
i
will
with
your
permission
have
a
smoke
with
dean
in
the
garden
to
steady
my
nerves
the
mere
notion
of
thirty
vases
of
unclaimed
precious
stones
hidden
down
yonder
is
enough
to
upset
any
man
equanimity
the
papyri
would
interest
me
more
than
the
jewels
said
dean
what
do
you
say
denzil
denzil
murray
woke
up
suddenly
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
oh
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
answered
i
never
was
very
much
interested
in
those
old
times
they
seem
to
me
all
myth
i
could
never
link
past
present
and
future
together
as
some
people
can
they
are
to
me
all
separate
things
the
past
is
done
with
the
present
is
our
own
to
enjoy
or
to
detest
and
the
future
no
man
can
look
into
ah
denzil
you
are
young
and
reflection
has
not
been
very
hard
at
work
in
that
headstrong
brain
of
yours
said
dean
with
an
indulgent
smile
otherwise
you
would
see
that
past
present
and
future
are
one
and
indissoluble
the
past
is
as
much
a
part
of
your
present
identity
as
the
present
and
the
future
too
lies
in
you
in
embryo
the
mystery
of
one
man
life
contains
all
mysteries
and
if
we
could
only
understand
it
from
its
very
beginning
we
should
find
out
the
cause
of
all
things
and
the
ultimate
intention
of
creation
well
now
you
have
all
had
enough
serious
talk
said
the
princess
ziska
lightly
so
let
us
adjourn
to
the
one
of
my
shall
sing
to
you
by
and
by
she
has
a
very
sweet
voice
is
it
she
who
sings
that
song
about
the
asked
gervase
suddenly
the
princess
smiled
strangely
yes
it
is
she
dean
chose
a
cigar
from
a
silver
box
on
the
table
gervase
did
the
same
wo
you
smoke
denzil
he
asked
carelessly
no
thanks
denzil
spoke
hurriedly
and
hoarsely
i
think
if
the
princess
will
permit
me
i
will
stay
and
talk
with
her
in
the
while
you
two
have
your
smoke
together
the
princess
gave
a
charming
bow
of
assent
to
this
proposition
gervase
took
the
doctor
somewhat
roughly
by
the
arm
and
led
him
out
through
the
open
french
window
into
the
grounds
beyond
remarking
as
he
went
you
will
excuse
us
princess
we
leave
you
in
good
company
she
smiled
i
will
excuse
you
certainly
but
do
not
be
long
and
she
passed
from
the
into
the
small
saloon
beyond
followed
closely
by
denzil
once
out
in
the
grounds
gervase
gave
vent
to
a
boisterous
fit
of
wild
laughter
so
loud
and
fierce
that
little
dean
came
to
an
abrupt
standstill
and
stared
at
him
in
something
of
alarm
as
well
as
amazement
are
you
going
mad
gervase
he
asked
yes
cried
gervase
that
is
just
it
i
am
going
mad
mad
for
love
or
whatever
you
please
to
call
it
what
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
flesh
and
blood
or
heavens
do
you
think
if
all
the
elements
were
to
combine
in
a
war
against
me
they
should
cheat
me
out
of
this
woman
or
rob
me
of
her
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
satisfy
yourself
my
excellent
doctor
with
your
musty
records
of
the
past
prate
as
you
choose
of
the
future
but
in
the
immediate
burning
active
present
my
will
is
law
and
the
fool
denzil
thinks
to
thwart
me
i
who
have
never
been
thwarted
since
i
knew
the
meaning
of
existence
he
paused
in
a
kind
of
breathless
agitation
and
dean
grasped
his
arm
firmly
come
come
what
is
all
this
excitement
for
he
said
what
are
you
saying
about
denzil
gervase
controlled
himself
with
a
violent
effort
and
forced
a
smile
he
has
got
his
chance
i
have
given
it
to
him
he
is
alone
with
the
princess
and
he
is
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
nonsense
said
the
doctor
sharply
if
he
does
commit
such
a
folly
it
will
be
no
use
the
woman
is
not
human
not
human
echoed
gervase
his
black
eyes
dilating
with
a
sudden
amazement
what
do
you
mean
the
little
doctor
rubbed
his
nose
impatiently
and
seemed
sorry
he
had
spoken
i
mean
let
me
see
what
do
i
mean
he
said
at
last
meditatively
oh
well
it
is
easy
enough
of
explanation
there
are
plenty
of
people
like
the
princess
ziska
to
whom
i
would
apply
the
words
human
she
is
all
beauty
and
no
heart
again
if
you
follow
me
she
is
all
desire
and
no
passion
which
is
a
character
unto
the
beasts
which
perish
a
large
majority
of
men
are
made
so
and
some
women
though
the
women
are
comparatively
few
now
so
far
as
the
princess
ziska
is
concerned
continued
the
doctor
fixing
his
keen
penetrative
glance
on
gervase
as
he
spoke
i
frankly
admit
to
you
that
i
find
in
her
material
for
a
very
curious
and
complex
study
that
is
why
i
have
come
after
her
here
i
have
said
she
is
all
desire
and
no
passion
that
of
itself
is
inhuman
but
what
i
am
busy
about
now
is
to
try
and
analyze
the
nature
of
the
particular
desire
that
moves
her
controls
her
keeps
her
alive
in
short
it
is
not
love
of
that
i
feel
confident
and
it
is
not
hate
though
it
is
more
like
hate
than
love
it
is
something
indefinable
something
that
is
almost
occult
so
and
bewildering
is
the
riddle
you
look
upon
me
as
a
madman
yes
i
know
you
do
but
mad
or
sane
i
emphatically
repeat
the
princess
is
not
human
and
by
this
expression
i
wish
to
imply
that
though
she
has
the
outward
appearance
of
a
most
beautiful
and
seductive
human
body
she
has
the
soul
of
a
fiend
now
do
you
understand
me
it
would
take
oedipus
himself
all
his
time
to
do
that
said
gervase
forcing
a
laugh
which
had
no
mirth
in
it
for
he
was
conscious
of
a
vaguely
unpleasant
sensation
a
chill
as
of
some
dark
presentiment
which
oppressed
his
mind
when
you
know
i
do
not
believe
in
the
soul
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
it
the
soul
of
a
fiend
the
soul
of
an
angel
what
are
they
mere
empty
terms
to
me
meaning
nothing
i
think
i
agree
with
you
though
in
one
or
two
points
concerning
the
princess
par
exemple
i
do
not
look
upon
her
as
one
of
those
delicately
embodied
purities
of
womanhood
before
whom
we
men
instinctively
bend
in
reverence
but
whom
at
the
same
time
we
generally
avoid
ashamed
of
our
vileness
no
she
is
certainly
not
one
of
the
roses
left
to
die
because
they
climb
so
near
the
sky
that
not
the
boldest
can
pluck
them
from
their
vantage
high
and
whether
it
is
best
to
be
a
solitary
or
a
princess
ziska
who
shall
say
and
human
or
inhuman
whatever
composition
she
is
made
of
you
may
make
yourself
positively
certain
that
denzil
murray
is
just
now
doing
his
best
to
persuade
her
to
be
a
highland
chatelaine
in
the
future
heavens
what
a
strange
fate
it
will
be
for
la
belle
egyptienne
oh
you
think
she
is
egyptian
then
queried
dean
with
an
air
of
lively
curiosity
of
course
i
do
she
has
the
egyptian
type
of
form
and
countenance
consider
only
the
resemblance
between
her
and
the
dancer
she
chose
to
represent
the
other
night
the
of
the
antique
sculpture
on
her
walls
ay
but
if
you
grant
one
resemblance
you
must
also
admit
another
said
the
doctor
quickly
the
likeness
between
yourself
and
the
warrior
araxes
is
no
less
remarkable
gervase
moved
uneasily
and
a
sudden
pallor
blanched
his
face
making
it
look
wan
and
haggard
in
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
and
it
is
rather
singular
went
on
the
imperturbable
savant
that
according
to
the
legend
or
history
whichever
you
please
to
consider
it
for
in
time
legends
become
histories
and
histories
legends
araxes
should
have
been
the
lover
of
this
very
and
that
you
who
are
the
living
portrait
of
araxes
should
suddenly
become
enamored
of
the
equally
living
portrait
of
the
dead
woman
you
must
own
that
to
a
mere
onlooker
and
observer
like
myself
it
seems
a
curious
coincidence
gervase
smoked
on
in
silence
his
level
brows
contracted
in
a
musing
frown
yes
it
seems
curious
he
said
at
last
but
a
great
many
curious
coincidences
happen
in
this
world
so
many
that
we
in
our
days
of
rush
and
turmoil
have
not
time
to
consider
them
as
they
come
or
go
perhaps
of
all
the
strange
things
in
life
the
sudden
sympathies
and
the
headstrong
passions
which
spring
up
in
a
day
or
a
night
between
certain
men
and
certain
women
are
the
strangest
i
look
upon
you
doctor
as
a
very
clever
fellow
with
just
a
little
twist
in
his
brain
or
let
us
say
a
about
spiritual
matters
but
in
one
of
your
more
or
less
fantastic
and
extravagant
theories
i
am
half
disposed
to
believe
and
that
is
the
notion
you
have
of
the
possibility
of
some
natures
male
and
female
having
met
before
in
a
previous
state
of
existence
and
under
different
forms
such
as
birds
flowers
or
forest
animals
or
even
mere
incorporeal
breaths
of
air
and
flame
it
is
an
idea
which
i
confess
fascinates
me
it
seems
fairly
reasonable
too
for
as
many
scientists
argue
that
you
can
not
destroy
matter
but
only
transform
it
there
is
really
nothing
impossible
in
the
suggestion
he
paused
then
added
slowly
as
he
flung
the
end
of
his
cigar
away
i
have
felt
the
force
of
this
odd
fancy
of
yours
most
strongly
since
i
met
the
princess
ziska
indeed
then
the
impression
she
gave
you
first
is
still
upon
you
that
of
having
known
her
before
gervase
waited
a
minute
or
two
before
replying
then
he
answered
yes
and
not
only
of
having
known
her
before
but
of
having
loved
her
before
love
mon
dieu
what
a
tame
word
it
is
how
poorly
it
expresses
the
actual
emotion
fire
in
the
veins
delirium
in
the
brain
reason
gone
to
chaos
and
this
madness
is
mildly
described
as
there
are
other
words
for
it
said
the
doctor
words
that
are
not
so
poetic
but
which
perhaps
are
more
fitting
no
interrupted
gervase
almost
fiercely
there
are
no
words
which
truly
describe
this
one
emotion
which
rules
the
world
i
know
what
you
mean
of
course
you
mean
evil
words
licentious
words
and
yet
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
these
you
can
not
call
such
an
exalted
state
of
the
nerves
and
sensations
by
an
evil
name
dean
pondered
the
question
for
a
few
moments
no
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
he
said
meditatively
if
i
did
i
should
have
to
give
an
evil
name
to
the
creator
who
designed
man
and
woman
and
ordained
the
law
of
attraction
which
draws
and
often
drags
them
together
i
like
to
be
fair
to
everybody
the
creator
included
yet
to
be
fair
to
everybody
i
shall
appear
to
sanction
immorality
for
the
fact
is
that
our
civilization
has
upset
all
the
original
intentions
of
nature
nature
evidently
meant
love
or
the
emotion
we
call
love
to
be
the
keynote
of
the
universe
but
apparently
nature
did
not
intend
marriage
the
flowers
the
birds
the
lower
animals
mate
afresh
every
spring
and
this
is
the
creed
that
the
disciples
of
naturalism
nowadays
are
anxious
to
force
upon
the
attention
of
the
world
it
is
only
men
and
women
they
say
that
are
so
foolish
as
to
take
each
other
for
better
or
worse
till
death
do
them
part
now
i
should
like
from
the
physical
scientist
point
of
view
to
prove
that
the
men
and
women
are
wrong
and
that
the
lower
animals
are
right
but
spiritual
science
comes
in
and
confutes
me
for
in
spiritual
science
i
find
this
truth
which
will
not
be
gainsaid
namely
that
from
time
immemorial
certain
immortal
forms
of
nature
have
been
created
solely
for
one
another
like
two
halves
of
a
circle
they
are
intended
to
meet
and
form
the
perfect
round
and
all
the
elements
of
creation
spiritual
and
material
will
work
their
hardest
to
pull
them
together
such
natures
i
consider
should
absolutely
and
imperatively
be
joined
in
marriage
it
then
becomes
a
divine
decree
even
grant
if
you
like
that
the
natures
so
joined
are
evil
and
that
the
sympathy
between
them
is
of
a
more
or
less
reprehensible
character
it
is
quite
as
well
that
they
should
unite
and
that
the
result
of
such
an
union
should
be
seen
the
evil
might
come
out
of
them
in
a
family
of
criminals
which
the
law
could
exterminate
with
advantage
to
the
world
in
general
whereas
on
the
other
hand
given
two
fine
and
aspiring
natures
with
perfect
sympathy
between
them
as
perfect
as
the
two
notes
of
a
perfect
chord
the
children
of
such
a
marriage
would
probably
be
as
near
gods
as
humanity
could
bring
them
i
speak
as
a
scientist
merely
such
consequences
are
not
foreseen
by
the
majority
and
marriages
as
a
rule
take
place
between
persons
who
are
by
no
means
made
for
each
other
besides
a
kind
of
devil
comes
into
the
business
and
often
prevents
the
two
sympathetic
natures
conjoining
alone
are
quite
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
there
is
a
devil
as
well
as
a
divinity
that
our
ends
you
speak
as
if
you
yourself
had
loved
doctor
said
gervase
with
a
half
smile
and
so
i
have
replied
the
doctor
calmly
i
have
loved
to
the
full
as
passionately
and
ardently
as
even
you
can
love
i
thank
god
the
woman
i
loved
died
i
could
never
have
possessed
her
for
she
was
already
wedded
and
i
would
not
have
disgraced
her
by
robbing
her
from
her
lawful
husband
so
death
stepped
in
and
gave
her
to
me
forever
and
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
solemn
starlit
sky
yes
nothing
can
ever
come
between
us
now
no
demon
tears
her
white
soul
from
me
she
died
innocent
of
evil
and
she
is
mine
mine
in
every
pulse
of
her
being
as
we
shall
both
know
hereafter
his
face
which
was
not
remarkable
for
any
beauty
of
feature
grew
rapt
and
almost
noble
in
its
expression
and
gervase
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
touch
of
ironical
wonder
upon
my
word
your
morality
almost
outreaches
your
mysticism
he
said
i
see
you
are
one
of
those
men
who
think
marriage
a
sacred
sort
of
thing
and
the
only
form
of
love
i
may
be
replied
dean
but
i
certainly
believe
in
marriage
for
the
woman
sake
if
the
license
of
men
were
not
restrained
by
some
sort
of
barrier
it
would
break
all
bounds
now
i
had
i
chosen
could
have
taken
the
woman
i
loved
to
myself
it
needed
but
a
little
skilful
persuasion
on
my
part
for
her
husband
was
a
ruffian
and
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
you
not
do
so
demanded
gervase
impatiently
because
i
know
the
end
of
all
such
liaisons
said
the
doctor
sadly
a
month
or
two
of
delirious
happiness
then
years
of
remorse
to
follow
the
man
is
lowered
in
his
own
secret
estimation
of
himself
and
the
woman
is
hopelessly
ruined
socially
and
morally
no
death
is
far
better
and
in
my
case
death
has
proved
a
good
friend
for
it
has
given
me
the
spotless
soul
of
the
woman
i
loved
which
is
far
fairer
than
her
body
was
but
unfortunately
intangible
said
gervase
satirically
the
doctor
looked
at
him
keenly
and
coldly
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
my
friend
never
talk
about
what
you
do
not
understand
you
only
wander
astray
the
spiritual
world
is
a
blank
to
you
so
do
not
presume
to
judge
of
what
you
will
never
realize
till
realization
is
forced
upon
you
he
uttered
the
last
words
with
slow
and
singular
emphasis
forced
upon
me
began
gervase
what
do
you
mean
he
broke
off
abruptly
for
at
that
moment
denzil
murray
emerged
from
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
and
came
towards
them
with
an
unsteady
swaying
step
like
that
of
a
drunken
man
you
had
better
go
in
to
the
princess
he
said
staring
at
gervase
with
a
wild
smile
she
is
waiting
for
you
what
the
matter
with
you
denzil
inquired
dean
catching
him
by
the
arm
as
he
made
a
movement
to
go
on
and
pass
them
denzil
stopped
frowning
impatiently
matter
nothing
what
should
be
the
matter
oh
no
offence
no
offence
my
boy
and
dean
at
once
loosened
his
arm
i
only
thought
you
looked
as
if
you
had
had
some
upset
or
worry
that
all
climate
climate
said
denzil
hoarsely
egypt
does
not
agree
with
me
i
suppose
the
dryness
of
the
soil
breeds
fever
and
a
touch
of
madness
men
are
not
blocks
of
wood
or
monoliths
of
stone
they
are
creatures
of
flesh
and
blood
of
nerve
and
muscle
you
can
not
torture
them
so
he
interrupted
himself
with
a
kind
of
breathless
irritation
at
his
own
speech
gervase
regarded
him
steadily
slightly
smiling
torture
them
how
denzil
asked
the
doctor
kindly
dear
lad
you
are
talking
nonsense
come
and
stroll
with
me
up
and
down
the
air
is
quite
balmy
and
delightful
it
will
cool
your
brain
yes
it
needs
cooling
retorted
denzil
beginning
to
laugh
with
a
sort
of
wild
hilarity
too
much
wine
too
much
woman
too
much
of
these
musty
records
and
ghastly
pyramids
here
he
broke
off
adding
quickly
doctor
helen
and
i
will
go
back
to
england
next
week
if
all
is
well
why
certainly
certainly
said
dean
soothingly
i
think
we
are
all
beginning
to
feel
we
have
had
enough
of
egypt
i
shall
probably
return
home
with
you
meanwhile
come
for
a
stroll
and
talk
to
me
monsieur
armand
gervase
will
perhaps
go
in
and
excuse
us
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
princess
ziska
with
pleasure
said
gervase
then
beckoning
denzil
murray
aside
he
whispered
tell
me
have
you
won
or
lost
lost
replied
denzil
fiercely
through
his
set
teeth
it
is
your
turn
now
but
if
you
win
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
above
us
i
will
kill
you
soit
but
not
till
i
am
ready
for
killing
after
night
i
shall
be
at
your
service
not
till
then
and
smiling
coldly
his
dark
face
looking
singularly
pale
and
stern
in
the
moonlight
gervase
turned
away
and
walking
with
his
usual
light
swift
yet
leisurely
tread
entered
the
princess
apartment
by
the
french
window
which
was
still
open
and
from
which
the
sound
of
sweet
music
came
floating
deliciously
on
the
air
as
he
disappeared
chapter
xiv
in
a
attitude
of
indolently
graceful
ease
the
princess
ziska
watched
from
beneath
the
slumbrous
shadow
of
her
eyelids
the
approach
of
her
now
controlled
lover
he
came
towards
her
with
a
certain
impetuosity
of
movement
which
was
so
far
removed
from
ordinary
conventionality
as
to
be
wholly
admirable
from
the
purely
picturesque
point
of
view
despite
the
fact
that
it
expressed
more
passion
and
impatience
than
were
in
keeping
with
customs
and
manners
he
had
almost
reached
her
side
before
he
became
aware
that
there
were
two
other
women
in
the
room
besides
the
princess
silent
veiled
figures
that
sat
or
rather
crouched
on
the
floor
holding
quaintly
carved
and
inlaid
musical
instruments
of
some
antique
date
in
their
hands
the
only
sign
of
life
about
them
being
their
large
dark
glistening
eyes
which
were
every
now
and
then
raised
and
fixed
on
gervase
with
an
intense
and
searching
look
of
inquiry
strangely
embarrassed
by
their
glances
he
addressed
the
princess
in
a
low
tone
will
you
not
send
away
your
women
she
smiled
yes
presently
if
you
wish
it
i
will
but
you
must
hear
some
music
first
sit
down
there
and
she
pointed
with
her
small
jewelled
hand
to
a
low
chair
near
her
own
my
lutist
shall
sing
you
something
in
english
of
course
for
all
the
world
is
being
anglicized
by
degrees
and
there
will
soon
be
no
separate
nations
left
something
too
of
romantic
southern
passion
is
being
gradually
grafted
on
to
english
sentiment
so
that
english
songs
are
not
so
stupid
as
they
were
once
i
translated
some
stanzas
from
one
of
the
old
egyptian
poets
into
english
the
other
day
perhaps
you
will
like
them
myrmentis
sing
us
the
of
darkness
an
odd
sensation
of
familiarity
with
the
name
of
myrmentis
startled
gervase
as
he
heard
it
pronounced
and
he
looked
at
the
girl
who
was
so
called
in
a
kind
of
dread
but
she
did
not
meet
his
questioning
regard
she
was
already
bending
over
her
lute
and
tuning
its
strings
while
her
companion
likewise
prepared
to
accompany
her
on
a
similar
though
larger
instrument
and
in
moment
her
voice
full
and
rich
with
a
sobbing
passion
in
it
which
thrilled
him
to
the
inmost
soul
rang
out
on
the
warm
silence
in
the
darkness
what
deeds
are
done
what
wild
words
spoken
what
joys
are
tasted
what
passion
wasted
what
hearts
are
broken
not
a
glimpse
of
the
moon
shall
shine
not
a
star
shall
mark
the
passing
of
night
or
shed
its
light
on
my
dream
of
the
dark
on
the
scented
and
slumbrous
air
strange
thoughts
are
thronging
and
a
blind
desire
more
fierce
than
fire
fills
the
soul
with
longing
through
the
silence
heavy
and
sweet
comes
the
panting
breath
of
a
lover
unseen
from
the
whose
loving
is
death
in
the
darkness
a
deed
was
done
a
wild
word
spoken
a
joy
was
tasted
a
passion
wasted
a
heart
was
broken
not
a
glimpse
of
the
moon
shall
shine
not
a
star
shall
mark
the
passing
of
night
or
shed
its
light
on
my
dream
of
the
dark
the
song
died
away
in
a
shuddering
echo
and
before
gervase
had
time
to
raise
his
eyes
from
their
brooding
study
of
the
floor
the
singer
and
her
companion
had
noiselessly
disappeared
and
he
was
left
alone
with
the
princess
ziska
he
drew
along
breath
and
turning
fully
round
in
his
chair
looked
at
her
steadily
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
her
lips
a
smile
of
mingled
mockery
and
triumph
her
beautiful
eyes
glittered
leaning
towards
her
he
grasped
her
hands
suddenly
in
his
own
now
he
whispered
shall
i
speak
or
be
silent
whichever
you
please
she
responded
composedly
still
smiling
speech
or
silence
rest
equally
with
yourself
i
compel
neither
that
is
false
he
said
passionately
you
do
compel
your
eyes
drag
my
very
soul
out
of
me
your
touch
drives
me
into
frenzy
you
temptress
you
force
me
to
speak
though
you
know
already
what
i
have
to
say
that
i
love
you
love
you
and
that
you
love
me
that
your
whole
life
leaps
to
mine
as
mine
to
yours
you
know
all
this
if
i
were
stricken
dumb
you
could
read
it
in
my
face
but
you
will
have
it
spoken
you
will
extort
from
me
the
whole
secret
of
my
madness
yes
for
you
to
take
a
cruel
joy
in
knowing
that
i
am
mad
mad
for
the
love
of
you
and
you
can
not
be
too
often
or
too
thoroughly
assured
that
your
own
passion
finds
its
reflex
in
me
he
paused
abruptly
checked
in
his
wild
words
by
the
sound
of
her
low
sweet
chill
laughter
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
burning
grasp
my
dear
friend
she
said
lightly
you
really
have
a
very
excellent
opinion
of
yourself
excuse
me
for
saying
so
own
passion
do
you
actually
suppose
i
have
a
for
you
and
rising
from
her
chair
she
drew
up
her
slim
supple
figure
to
its
full
height
and
looked
at
him
with
an
amused
and
airy
scorn
you
are
totally
mistaken
no
one
man
living
can
move
me
to
love
i
know
all
men
too
well
their
natures
are
uniformly
composed
of
the
same
mixture
of
cruelty
lust
and
selfishness
and
forever
and
forever
through
all
the
ages
of
the
world
they
use
the
greater
part
of
their
intellectual
abilities
in
devising
new
ways
to
condone
and
conceal
their
vices
you
call
me
why
the
temptation
if
any
there
be
emanates
from
yourself
and
your
own
unbridled
desires
i
do
nothing
i
am
made
as
i
am
made
if
my
face
or
my
form
seems
fair
in
your
eyes
this
is
not
my
fault
your
glance
lights
on
me
as
the
hawk
lights
on
coveted
prey
but
think
you
the
prey
loves
the
hawk
in
response
it
is
the
mistake
all
men
make
with
all
women
to
judge
them
always
as
being
of
the
same
base
material
as
themselves
some
women
there
are
who
shame
their
womanhood
but
the
majority
as
a
rule
preserve
their
till
taught
by
men
to
lose
it
gervase
sprang
up
and
faced
her
his
eyes
flashing
dangerously
do
not
make
any
pretence
with
me
he
said
half
angrily
never
tell
me
you
can
not
love
i
have
loved
she
interrupted
him
as
true
women
love
once
and
only
once
it
suffices
not
for
one
lifetime
but
many
i
loved
and
gave
myself
ungrudgingly
and
trustingly
to
the
man
my
soul
worshipped
i
was
betrayed
of
course
it
is
the
usual
story
quite
old
quite
commonplace
i
can
tell
it
to
you
without
so
much
as
a
blush
of
pain
since
then
i
have
not
loved
i
have
hated
and
i
live
but
for
one
thing
revenge
her
face
paled
as
she
spoke
and
a
something
vague
dark
spectral
and
terrible
seemed
to
enfold
her
like
a
cloud
where
she
stood
anon
she
smiled
sweetly
and
with
a
bewitching
provocativeness
your
you
see
my
friend
awakens
rather
a
singular
in
me
not
quite
of
the
nature
you
imagined
he
remained
for
a
moment
inert
then
with
an
almost
savage
boldness
threw
his
arm
about
her
have
everything
your
own
way
ziska
he
said
in
quick
fierce
accents
i
will
accept
all
your
fancies
and
humor
all
your
caprices
i
will
grant
that
you
do
not
love
me
i
will
even
suppose
that
i
am
repellent
to
you
but
that
shall
make
no
difference
to
my
desire
you
shall
be
mine
willing
or
unwilling
if
every
kiss
i
take
from
your
lips
be
torn
from
you
with
reluctance
yet
those
kisses
i
will
have
you
shall
not
escape
me
you
you
out
of
all
women
in
the
world
i
choose
as
your
wife
said
ziska
slowly
her
dark
eyes
gleaming
with
a
strange
light
as
she
dexterously
withdrew
herself
from
his
embrace
he
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
my
wife
dieu
what
a
banalite
you
with
your
exquisite
glowing
beauty
and
voluptuous
charm
you
would
be
a
that
tiresome
of
utterly
dull
respectability
you
with
your
unmatched
air
of
wild
grace
and
freedom
would
submit
to
be
tied
down
in
the
bonds
of
marriage
marriage
which
to
my
thinking
and
that
of
many
other
men
of
my
character
is
one
of
the
many
curses
of
this
idiotic
nineteenth
century
no
i
offer
you
love
ziska
ideal
passionate
love
the
glowing
rapturous
dream
of
ecstasy
in
which
such
a
thing
as
marriage
would
be
impossible
the
merest
vulgar
commonplace
almost
a
profanity
i
understand
and
the
princess
ziska
regarded
him
intently
her
breath
coming
and
going
and
a
strange
smile
quivering
on
her
lips
you
would
play
the
part
of
an
araxes
over
again
he
smiled
and
with
all
the
audacity
of
a
bold
and
determined
nature
put
his
arms
round
her
and
drew
her
close
up
to
his
breast
yes
he
said
i
would
play
the
part
of
an
araxes
over
again
as
he
uttered
the
words
an
indescribable
sensation
of
horror
seized
him
a
mist
darkened
his
sight
his
blood
grew
cold
and
a
tremor
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
the
fair
woman
face
that
was
lifted
so
close
to
his
own
seemed
spectral
and
far
off
and
for
a
fleeting
moment
her
very
beauty
grew
into
something
like
hideousness
as
if
the
strange
effect
of
the
picture
he
had
painted
of
her
was
now
becoming
actual
and
apparent
namely
the
face
of
death
looking
through
the
mask
of
life
yet
he
did
not
loosen
his
arms
from
about
her
waist
on
the
contrary
he
clasped
her
even
more
closely
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
such
pertinacity
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
expected
her
to
vanish
from
his
sight
while
he
still
held
her
to
play
the
part
of
an
araxes
aright
she
murmured
then
in
slow
and
dulcet
accents
you
would
need
to
be
cruel
and
remorseless
and
sacrifice
my
life
or
any
woman
life
to
your
own
clamorous
and
selfish
passion
but
you
armand
gervase
educated
civilized
intellectual
and
totally
unlike
the
barbaric
araxes
could
not
do
that
could
you
the
progress
of
the
world
the
increasing
intelligence
of
humanity
the
coming
of
the
christ
these
things
are
surely
of
some
weight
with
you
are
they
not
or
are
you
made
of
the
same
savage
and
impenitent
stuff
as
composed
the
once
famous
yet
brutal
warrior
of
old
time
do
you
admire
the
character
and
spirit
of
araxes
he
who
if
history
reports
him
truly
would
snatch
a
woman
life
as
though
it
were
a
wayside
flower
crush
out
all
its
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
then
fling
it
into
the
dust
withered
and
dead
do
you
think
that
because
a
man
is
strong
and
famous
he
has
a
right
to
the
love
of
woman
a
charter
to
destroy
her
as
he
pleases
if
you
remember
the
story
i
told
you
araxes
murdered
with
his
own
hand
the
woman
who
loved
him
he
had
perhaps
grown
weary
of
her
said
gervase
speaking
with
an
effort
and
still
studying
the
exquisite
loveliness
of
the
bewitching
face
that
was
so
close
to
his
own
like
a
man
in
a
dream
at
this
she
laughed
and
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulders
with
a
close
and
clinging
clasp
which
thrilled
him
strangely
ah
there
is
the
difficulty
she
said
what
cure
shall
ever
be
found
for
men
are
all
like
children
they
tire
of
their
toys
hence
the
frequent
trouble
and
discomfort
of
marriage
they
grow
weary
of
the
same
face
the
same
caressing
arms
the
same
faithful
heart
you
for
instance
would
grow
weary
of
me
i
think
not
answered
gervase
and
now
the
vague
sense
of
uncertainty
and
pain
which
had
distressed
him
passed
away
leaving
him
fully
once
more
i
think
you
are
one
of
those
exceptional
women
whom
a
man
never
grows
weary
of
like
a
cleopatra
or
any
other
enchantress
you
fascinate
with
a
look
you
fasten
with
a
touch
and
you
have
a
singular
freshness
and
wild
attraction
about
you
which
makes
you
unlike
any
other
of
your
sex
i
know
well
enough
that
i
shall
never
get
the
memory
of
you
out
of
my
brain
your
face
will
haunt
me
till
i
die
and
after
death
she
queried
her
eyes
and
regarding
him
languorously
through
her
silky
black
lashes
ah
ma
belle
after
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
even
in
the
way
of
love
tout
est
fini
considering
the
brevity
of
life
and
the
absolute
certainty
of
death
i
think
that
the
men
and
women
who
are
so
foolish
as
to
miss
any
opportunities
of
enjoyment
while
they
are
alive
deserve
more
punishment
than
those
who
take
all
they
can
get
even
in
the
line
of
what
is
called
wickedness
wickedness
is
a
curious
thing
it
takes
different
shapes
in
different
lands
and
what
is
called
here
is
virtue
in
let
us
say
the
fiji
islands
there
is
really
no
strict
rule
of
conduct
in
the
world
no
fixed
law
of
morality
there
is
honor
said
the
princess
slowly
a
code
which
even
savages
recognize
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
hesitate
but
his
indecision
soon
passed
his
face
flushed
and
anon
grew
pale
as
closing
his
arms
more
victoriously
round
the
fair
woman
who
just
then
appeared
voluntarily
to
yield
to
his
embrace
he
bent
down
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
tiny
ear
white
and
delicate
as
a
shell
which
was
by
the
rich
loose
clusters
of
her
luxuriant
hair
she
heard
and
smiled
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
singular
ferocity
which
he
did
not
see
otherwise
it
might
have
startled
him
i
will
answer
you
she
said
be
patient
till
then
and
as
she
spoke
she
released
herself
determinedly
from
the
clasp
of
his
arms
and
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
looking
at
him
with
a
fixed
and
searching
scrutiny
do
not
preach
patience
to
me
he
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
i
never
had
that
virtue
and
i
certainly
can
not
begin
to
cultivate
it
now
had
you
ever
any
virtues
she
asked
in
a
playful
tone
of
something
like
satire
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
not
know
what
you
consider
virtues
he
answered
lightly
if
honesty
is
one
i
have
that
i
make
no
pretence
to
be
what
i
am
not
i
would
not
pass
off
somebody
else
picture
as
my
own
for
instance
but
i
can
not
sham
to
be
moral
i
could
not
possibly
love
a
woman
without
wanting
her
all
to
myself
and
i
have
not
the
slightest
belief
in
the
sanctimonious
humbug
of
a
man
who
plays
the
platonic
lover
only
but
i
do
cheat
and
i
do
lie
i
am
what
i
am
a
man
said
ziska
a
lurid
and
vindictive
light
dilating
and
firing
her
wonderful
eyes
a
man
the
essence
of
all
that
is
evil
the
possibility
of
all
that
is
good
but
the
essence
is
strong
and
works
the
possibility
is
a
dream
which
dissolves
in
the
dreaming
yes
you
are
right
ma
chere
he
responded
carelessly
goodness
as
the
world
understands
goodness
never
makes
a
career
for
itself
worth
anything
even
christ
who
has
figured
as
a
symbol
of
goodness
for
eighteen
hundred
years
was
not
devoid
of
the
sin
of
ambition
he
wanted
to
reign
over
all
judaea
you
view
him
in
that
light
inquired
ziska
with
a
keen
look
and
as
man
only
why
of
course
the
idea
of
an
incarnate
god
has
long
ago
been
discarded
by
all
reasoning
thinkers
and
what
of
an
incarnate
devil
pursued
ziska
her
breath
coming
and
going
quickly
as
impossible
as
the
other
fancy
he
responded
almost
gayly
there
are
no
gods
and
no
devils
ma
belle
the
world
is
ruled
by
ourselves
alone
and
it
behoves
us
to
make
the
best
of
it
how
will
you
give
me
my
answer
when
shall
i
see
you
speak
low
and
quickly
dean
is
coming
in
here
from
the
garden
when
when
i
will
send
for
you
she
answered
at
what
hour
the
moon
rises
at
ten
and
at
ten
my
messenger
shall
come
for
you
a
trustworthy
messenger
i
hope
one
who
knows
how
to
be
silent
as
silent
as
the
grave
she
said
looking
at
him
fixedly
as
secret
as
the
great
pyramid
and
the
hidden
tomb
of
araxes
and
smiling
she
turned
to
greet
dean
who
just
then
entered
the
saloon
denzil
has
gone
to
bed
he
announced
he
begged
me
to
excuse
him
to
you
princess
i
think
the
boy
is
feverish
egypt
does
agree
with
him
i
am
sorry
he
is
ill
said
the
princess
with
a
charming
air
of
sympathy
oh
he
is
exactly
ill
returned
the
doctor
looking
sharply
at
her
beautiful
face
as
he
spoke
he
is
simply
unnerved
and
restless
i
am
a
little
anxious
about
him
i
think
he
ought
to
go
back
to
england
or
scotland
i
think
so
too
agreed
gervase
and
mademoiselle
helen
with
him
mademoiselle
helen
you
consider
very
beautiful
murmured
the
princess
unfurling
her
fan
and
waving
it
indolently
to
and
fro
no
not
beautiful
answered
the
doctor
quickly
but
very
pretty
sweet
and
lovable
and
good
ah
then
of
course
some
one
will
break
her
heart
said
the
princess
calmly
that
is
what
always
happens
to
good
women
and
she
smiled
as
she
saw
gervase
flush
half
with
anger
half
with
shame
the
little
doctor
rubbed
his
nose
crossly
not
always
princess
he
said
sometimes
it
does
in
fact
pretty
often
it
is
an
unfortunate
truth
that
virtue
is
seldom
rewarded
in
this
world
virtue
in
a
woman
nowadays
means
no
lovers
and
no
fun
said
gervase
gayly
and
the
possibility
of
a
highly
decorous
marriage
with
a
curate
or
a
bankclerk
followed
by
the
pleasing
result
of
a
family
of
little
curates
or
little
it
is
not
a
dazzling
prospect
the
doctor
smiled
grimly
then
after
a
wavering
moment
of
indecision
broke
out
into
a
chuckling
laugh
you
have
an
odd
way
of
putting
things
he
said
but
i
afraid
you
may
be
right
in
your
estimate
of
the
position
quite
as
many
women
are
as
miserably
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
virtue
as
of
vice
it
is
mad
world
as
shakespeare
says
i
hope
the
next
life
we
pass
into
after
this
one
will
at
least
be
sane
well
if
you
believe
in
heaven
you
have
testament
authority
for
the
fact
that
there
will
be
marriage
nor
giving
in
there
at
any
rate
laughed
gervase
and
if
we
wish
to
follow
that
text
out
truly
in
our
present
state
of
existence
and
become
the
angels
of
god
we
ought
at
once
to
abolish
matrimony
have
done
have
done
exclaimed
the
doctor
still
smiling
however
notwithstanding
his
protest
you
southern
frenchmen
are
half
barbarians
you
have
neither
religion
nor
morality
dieu
merci
said
gervase
irreverently
then
turning
to
the
princess
ziska
he
bowed
low
and
with
a
courtly
grace
over
the
hand
she
extended
towards
him
in
farewell
princess
then
in
a
whisper
he
added
i
shall
await
your
summons
it
will
come
without
fail
never
fear
she
answered
in
equally
soft
tones
i
hope
it
may
find
you
ready
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gave
her
one
long
lingering
passionate
look
then
with
another
which
included
dean
left
the
room
the
doctor
lingered
a
moment
studying
the
face
and
form
of
the
princess
with
a
curiously
inquisitive
air
while
she
in
her
turn
confronted
him
haughtily
and
with
a
touch
of
defiance
in
her
aspect
well
said
the
savant
presently
after
a
pause
now
you
have
got
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
she
smiled
coldly
but
answered
nothing
you
need
not
flash
your
beautiful
eyes
at
me
in
that
eminently
unpleasant
fashion
pursued
the
doctor
easily
you
see
i
know
you
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
only
make
a
stand
against
you
in
one
respect
you
shall
not
kill
the
boy
denzil
he
is
nothing
to
me
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
i
know
he
is
nothing
to
you
but
you
are
something
to
him
he
does
not
recognize
your
nature
as
i
do
i
must
get
him
out
of
the
reach
of
your
spell
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
she
interrupted
him
a
sombre
melancholy
darkening
her
face
i
shall
be
gone
gone
altogether
inquired
the
doctor
calmly
and
without
surprise
not
to
come
back
not
in
this
present
generation
she
answered
still
dean
evinced
no
surprise
then
you
will
have
satisfied
yourself
he
asked
she
bent
her
head
for
the
time
being
yes
i
shall
have
satisfied
myself
there
followed
a
silence
during
which
the
little
doctor
looked
at
his
beautiful
companion
with
all
the
meditative
interest
of
a
scientist
engaged
in
working
out
some
intricate
and
deeply
interesting
problem
i
suppose
i
may
not
inquire
how
you
propose
to
obtain
this
satisfaction
he
said
you
may
inquire
but
you
will
not
be
answered
she
retorted
smiling
darkly
your
intentions
are
pitiless
still
smiling
she
said
not
a
word
you
are
impenitent
she
remained
silent
and
worst
of
all
you
do
not
desire
redemption
you
are
one
of
those
who
forever
and
ever
cry
be
thou
my
good
thus
for
you
christ
died
in
vain
a
faint
tremor
ran
through
her
but
she
was
still
mute
so
you
and
creatures
like
you
must
have
their
way
in
the
world
until
the
end
concluded
the
doctor
thoughtfully
and
if
all
the
philosophers
that
ever
lived
were
to
pronounce
you
what
you
are
they
would
be
disbelieved
and
condemned
as
madmen
well
princess
i
am
glad
i
have
never
at
any
time
crossed
your
path
till
now
or
given
you
cause
of
offence
against
me
we
part
friends
i
trust
farewell
she
held
out
her
hand
he
hesitated
before
taking
it
are
you
afraid
she
queried
coldly
it
will
not
harm
you
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
he
said
at
once
clasping
the
white
taper
fingers
in
his
own
except
a
bad
conscience
that
will
never
trouble
you
and
the
princess
looked
at
him
full
and
steadily
there
are
no
dark
corners
in
your
life
no
mean
and
of
deceit
you
have
walked
on
the
open
and
straight
road
you
are
a
good
man
and
a
wise
one
but
though
you
in
your
knowledge
of
spiritual
things
recognize
me
for
what
i
am
take
my
advice
and
be
silent
on
the
matter
the
world
would
never
believe
the
truth
even
if
you
told
it
for
the
time
is
not
yet
ripe
for
men
and
women
to
recognize
the
avengers
of
their
wicked
deeds
they
are
kept
purposely
in
the
dark
lest
the
light
should
kill
and
with
her
sombre
eyes
darkening
yet
glowing
with
the
inward
fire
that
always
smouldered
in
their
dazzling
depths
she
saluted
him
gravely
and
gracefully
watching
him
to
the
last
as
he
slowly
withdrew
chapter
xv
the
next
day
broke
with
a
bright
hot
glare
over
the
wide
desert
and
the
sky
in
its
cloudless
burning
blue
had
more
than
its
usual
appearance
of
limitless
and
awful
immensity
the
sphinx
and
the
pyramids
alone
gave
a
shadow
and
a
substance
to
the
dazzling
and
transparent
air
all
the
rest
of
the
visible
landscape
seemed
naught
save
a
ocean
of
glittering
sand
scorched
by
the
blazing
sun
maxwell
dean
rose
early
and
went
down
to
the
hotel
breakfast
in
a
somewhat
depressed
frame
of
mind
he
had
slept
badly
and
his
dreams
had
been
unpleasant
when
not
actually
ghastly
and
he
was
considerably
relieved
though
he
could
not
have
told
why
when
he
saw
his
young
friend
denzil
murray
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
apparently
enjoying
an
excellent
meal
hullo
denzil
he
exclaimed
cheerily
i
hardly
expected
you
down
yet
are
you
better
thanks
i
am
perfectly
well
said
denzil
with
a
careless
air
i
thought
i
would
breakfast
early
in
order
to
drive
into
cairo
before
the
day
gets
too
sultry
into
cairo
echoed
the
doctor
why
are
you
going
to
stay
here
a
few
days
no
not
exactly
answered
denzil
stirring
his
coffee
quickly
and
beginning
to
swallow
it
in
large
gulps
i
shall
be
back
though
i
only
going
just
to
see
my
sister
and
tell
her
to
prepare
for
our
journey
home
i
sha
be
absent
more
than
a
few
hours
i
thought
you
might
possibly
like
to
go
a
little
further
up
the
nile
suggested
the
doctor
oh
no
i
had
enough
of
it
you
see
when
a
man
proposes
to
a
woman
and
gets
refused
he
ca
keep
on
dangling
round
that
woman
as
if
he
thought
it
possible
she
might
change
her
mind
and
he
forced
a
smile
i
got
an
appointment
with
gervase
morning
and
i
must
come
back
in
order
to
keep
it
but
after
that
i
off
an
appointment
with
gervase
repeated
the
doctor
slowly
what
sort
of
an
appointment
denzil
avoided
his
keen
look
really
doctor
you
are
getting
awfully
inquisitive
he
exclaimed
with
a
hard
laugh
you
want
to
know
altogether
too
much
yes
i
always
do
it
is
a
habit
of
mine
responded
dean
calmly
but
in
the
present
case
it
does
need
much
perspicuity
to
fathom
your
mystery
the
dullest
will
tell
you
he
can
see
through
a
millstone
when
there
a
hole
in
it
and
i
was
always
a
good
hand
at
putting
two
and
two
together
and
making
four
out
of
them
you
and
gervase
are
in
love
with
the
same
woman
the
woman
has
rejected
you
and
is
encouraging
gervase
gervase
you
think
will
on
this
very
night
be
in
the
position
of
the
accepted
lover
for
which
successful
fortune
attending
him
you
the
rejected
one
propose
to
kill
him
morning
if
you
can
unless
he
kills
you
and
you
are
going
to
cairo
to
get
your
pistols
or
whatever
weapons
you
have
arranged
to
fight
with
and
also
to
say
to
your
sister
denzil
kept
his
eyes
fixed
studiously
on
the
and
made
no
answer
however
continued
the
doctor
complacently
you
can
have
it
all
your
own
way
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
never
interfere
in
these
sort
of
matters
i
should
do
no
good
if
i
attempted
it
besides
i
have
the
slightest
anxiety
on
your
behalf
not
the
slightest
waiter
some
more
coffee
please
upon
my
word
exclaimed
denzil
with
a
fretful
laugh
you
are
a
most
extraordinary
man
doctor
i
hope
i
am
retorted
the
doctor
to
be
merely
ordinary
would
not
suit
my
line
of
ambition
this
is
very
excellent
coffee
here
he
peered
into
the
fresh
pot
of
the
fragrant
beverage
just
set
before
him
they
make
it
better
here
than
at
the
gezireh
palace
well
denzil
my
boy
when
you
get
into
cairo
give
my
love
to
helen
and
tell
her
all
go
home
to
the
old
country
together
i
myself
have
got
quite
enough
out
of
egypt
this
time
to
satisfy
my
fondness
for
new
experiences
and
let
me
assure
you
my
good
fellow
that
your
proposed
duel
with
gervase
will
not
come
off
it
will
come
off
said
denzil
with
sudden
fierceness
by
heaven
it
shall
it
must
more
wills
than
one
have
the
working
out
of
our
destinies
answered
dean
with
some
gravity
man
is
not
by
any
means
supreme
he
imagines
he
is
but
that
is
only
one
of
his
many
little
delusions
you
think
you
will
have
your
way
gervase
thinks
he
will
have
his
way
i
think
i
will
have
my
way
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
only
one
person
in
this
affair
whose
will
be
absolute
and
that
person
is
the
princess
ziska
ce
que
femme
veut
dieu
veut
she
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
declared
denzil
pardon
she
has
everything
to
do
with
it
she
is
the
cause
of
it
and
she
knows
it
and
as
i
have
already
told
you
your
proposed
fight
will
not
come
off
and
the
little
doctor
smiled
serenely
there
is
your
carriage
at
the
door
i
suppose
off
with
you
my
boy
be
off
like
a
whirlwind
and
return
here
armed
to
the
teeth
if
you
like
you
have
heard
the
expression
the
air
that
is
what
you
will
do
tomorrow
morning
and
apparently
in
the
best
of
all
possible
humors
dean
accompanied
his
young
friend
to
the
portico
of
the
hotel
and
watched
him
drive
off
down
the
stately
avenue
of
which
now
cast
their
refreshing
shade
on
the
entire
route
from
the
pyramids
to
cairo
when
he
had
fairly
gone
the
thoughtful
savant
surveyed
the
different
tourists
who
were
preparing
to
ascend
the
pyramids
under
the
escort
of
their
arab
guides
regardless
of
the
risks
they
ran
of
dislocated
arms
and
broken
and
in
the
study
of
the
various
odd
types
thus
presented
to
him
he
found
himself
fairly
well
amused
protoplasm
mere
protoplasm
he
murmured
the
germ
of
soul
has
not
yet
attained
to
individual
consciousness
in
any
one
of
these
strange
bipeds
their
thoughts
are
as
jelly
their
reasoning
powers
in
embryo
their
intellectual
faculties
barely
perceptible
yet
they
are
interesting
viewed
in
the
same
light
and
considered
on
the
same
scale
as
fish
or
insects
merely
as
men
and
women
of
course
they
are
misnomers
laughable
impossibilities
well
well
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
thousand
years
the
protoplasm
may
start
into
form
out
of
the
void
and
the
fibres
of
a
conscious
intellectuality
may
sprout
but
it
will
have
to
be
in
some
other
phase
of
existence
certainly
not
in
this
one
and
now
to
shut
myself
up
and
write
my
memoranda
for
i
must
not
lose
a
single
detail
of
this
singular
egyptian
psychic
problem
the
whole
thing
i
perceive
is
rounding
itself
towards
completion
and
catastrophe
but
in
what
way
how
will
it
how
can
it
end
and
with
a
meditative
frown
puckering
his
brows
dean
folded
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
retired
to
his
own
room
from
whence
he
did
not
emerge
all
day
armand
gervase
in
the
meanwhile
was
making
himself
the
life
and
soul
of
everything
at
the
mena
house
hotel
he
struck
up
an
easy
acquaintance
with
several
of
the
visitors
staying
there
said
pretty
things
to
young
women
and
pleasant
things
to
old
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
succeeded
in
becoming
the
most
popular
personage
in
the
place
he
accepted
invitations
to
parties
and
agreed
to
share
in
excursions
till
he
engaged
himself
for
every
day
in
the
coming
week
and
was
so
gay
and
gallant
and
fascinating
in
manner
and
bearing
that
fair
ladies
lost
their
hearts
to
him
at
a
glance
and
what
amusement
or
pleasure
there
was
at
the
mena
house
seemed
to
be
doubly
enhanced
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
in
truth
gervase
was
in
a
singular
mood
of
elation
and
excitation
a
strong
inward
triumph
possessed
him
and
filled
his
soul
with
an
imperious
pride
and
sense
of
conquest
which
for
the
time
being
made
him
feel
as
though
he
were
a
very
king
of
men
there
was
nothing
in
his
nature
of
the
noble
tenderness
which
makes
the
lover
mentally
exalt
his
beloved
as
a
queen
before
whom
he
is
content
to
submit
his
whole
soul
in
worship
what
he
realized
was
merely
this
that
here
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
seductive
women
ever
created
in
the
person
of
the
princess
ziska
and
that
he
gervase
meant
to
possess
that
loveliest
of
women
whatever
happened
in
the
near
or
distant
future
of
her
and
of
the
influence
of
his
passion
on
her
personally
he
did
not
stop
to
think
except
with
the
curiously
blind
egotism
which
is
the
heritage
of
most
men
and
which
led
him
to
judge
that
her
happiness
would
in
some
way
or
other
be
enhanced
by
his
brief
and
fickle
love
for
as
a
rule
men
do
not
understand
love
they
understand
desire
amounting
sometimes
to
merciless
covetousness
for
what
they
can
not
get
this
is
a
leading
natural
characteristic
of
the
masculine
nature
but
love
love
that
endures
silently
and
faithfully
through
the
stress
of
trouble
and
the
passing
of
years
love
which
sacrifices
everything
to
the
beloved
and
never
changes
or
falters
this
is
a
divine
passion
which
seldom
or
never
sanctifies
and
inspires
the
life
of
a
man
women
are
not
made
of
such
base
material
their
love
invariably
springs
first
from
the
ideal
not
the
sensual
and
if
afterwards
it
develops
into
the
sensual
it
is
through
the
rough
and
coarsening
touch
of
man
alone
throughout
the
entire
day
the
princess
ziska
herself
never
left
her
private
apartments
and
towards
late
afternoon
gervase
began
to
feel
the
hours
drag
along
with
unconscionable
slowness
and
monotony
never
did
the
sun
seem
so
slow
in
sinking
never
did
the
night
appear
so
far
off
when
at
last
dinner
was
served
in
the
hotel
both
denzil
murray
and
dean
sat
next
to
him
at
table
and
judging
from
outward
appearances
the
most
friendly
relations
existed
between
all
three
of
them
at
the
close
of
the
meal
however
denzil
made
a
sign
to
gervase
to
follow
him
and
when
they
had
reached
a
quiet
corner
said
i
am
aware
of
your
victory
you
have
won
where
i
have
lost
but
you
know
my
intention
perfectly
responded
gervase
with
a
cool
smile
by
heaven
went
on
the
younger
man
in
accents
of
suppressed
fury
if
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
which
besets
me
when
i
see
you
standing
there
facing
me
with
your
easy
and
demeanor
when
i
know
that
you
mean
dishonor
where
i
meant
honor
when
you
have
had
the
effrontery
to
confess
to
me
that
you
only
intend
to
make
the
princess
ziska
your
mistress
when
i
would
have
made
her
my
wife
god
i
could
shoot
you
dead
at
this
moment
gervase
looked
at
him
steadily
still
smiling
slightly
then
gradually
the
smile
died
away
leaving
his
countenance
shadowed
by
an
intense
melancholy
i
can
quite
enter
into
your
feelings
my
dear
boy
he
said
and
do
you
know
i
not
sure
that
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
if
you
were
to
shoot
me
dead
my
life
is
of
no
particular
value
to
anybody
certainly
not
to
myself
and
i
begin
to
think
i
been
always
more
or
less
of
a
failure
i
have
won
fame
but
i
have
missed
something
but
upon
my
word
i
do
quite
know
what
he
sighed
heavily
then
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
denzil
the
bitterest
foes
shake
hands
before
fighting
each
other
to
the
death
as
we
propose
to
do
it
is
a
civil
custom
and
hurts
no
one
i
should
like
to
part
kindly
from
you
denzil
hesitated
then
something
stronger
than
himself
made
him
yield
to
the
impulsive
note
of
strong
emotion
in
his
former
friend
voice
and
the
two
men
hands
met
in
a
momentary
silent
grasp
then
denzil
turned
quickly
away
morning
at
six
he
said
briefly
close
to
the
sphinx
good
responded
gervase
the
sphinx
shall
second
us
both
and
see
fair
play
denzil
responded
denzil
coldly
as
he
moved
on
and
disappeared
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
gervase
blood
as
he
watched
him
depart
odd
that
i
should
imagine
i
have
seen
the
last
of
him
he
murmured
there
are
strange
portents
in
the
air
of
the
desert
i
suppose
is
he
going
to
his
death
or
am
i
going
to
mine
again
the
cold
tremor
shook
him
and
combating
with
his
uneasy
sensations
he
went
to
his
own
apartment
there
to
await
the
expected
summons
of
the
princess
no
triumph
filled
him
now
no
sense
of
joy
elated
him
a
vague
fear
and
dull
foreboding
were
all
the
emotions
he
was
conscious
of
even
his
impatient
desire
of
love
had
cooled
and
he
watched
the
darkening
of
night
over
the
desert
and
the
stars
shining
out
one
by
one
in
the
black
azure
of
the
heavens
with
a
gradually
deepening
depression
a
dreamy
sense
stole
over
him
of
remoteness
or
detachment
from
all
visible
things
as
though
he
were
suddenly
and
mysteriously
separated
from
the
rest
of
humankind
by
an
invisible
force
which
he
was
powerless
to
resist
he
was
still
lost
in
this
vague
or
reverie
when
a
light
tap
startled
him
back
to
the
realization
of
earth
and
his
earthly
surroundings
in
response
to
his
entrez
the
tall
nubian
whom
he
had
seen
in
cairo
as
the
guardian
of
the
princess
household
appeared
his
repulsive
features
looking
if
anything
more
ghastly
and
hideous
than
ever
madame
la
princesse
demande
votre
presence
said
this
unlovely
attendant
of
one
of
the
fairest
of
women
without
a
moment
hesitation
or
loss
of
time
gervase
obeyed
and
allowing
his
guide
to
precede
him
at
a
little
distance
followed
him
through
the
corridors
of
the
hotel
out
at
the
hall
door
and
beyond
through
the
garden
a
clock
struck
ten
as
they
passed
into
the
warm
evening
air
and
the
mellow
rays
of
the
moon
were
beginning
to
whiten
the
sides
of
the
great
pyramid
a
few
of
the
people
staying
in
the
hotel
were
lounging
about
but
these
paid
no
particular
heed
to
gervase
or
his
companion
at
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
entrance
of
the
mena
house
the
nubian
stopped
and
waited
till
gervase
came
up
with
him
madame
la
princesse
vous
aime
monsieur
gervase
he
said
with
a
sarcastic
grin
mais
elle
veut
que
soit
toujours
aveugle
oui
toujours
le
destin
qui
vous
appelle
il
faut
soumettre
sans
yeux
oui
en
fin
comme
ca
and
before
gervase
could
utter
a
word
of
protest
or
demand
the
meaning
of
this
strange
proceeding
his
arms
was
suddenly
seized
and
pinioned
behind
his
back
his
mouth
gagged
and
his
eyes
blindfolded
maintenant
continued
the
nubian
nous
irons
ensemble
choked
and
mad
with
rage
gervase
for
a
few
moments
struggled
furiously
as
well
as
he
was
able
with
his
powerful
captor
all
sorts
of
ideas
surged
in
his
brain
the
princess
ziska
might
with
all
her
beauty
and
fascination
be
nothing
but
the
ruler
of
a
band
of
robbers
and
murderers
who
could
tell
yet
reason
did
not
wholly
desert
him
in
extremity
for
even
while
he
tried
to
fight
for
his
liberty
he
remembered
that
there
was
no
good
to
be
gained
out
of
taking
him
prisoner
he
had
neither
money
nor
valuables
nothing
which
could
excite
the
cupidity
of
even
a
starving
bedouin
as
this
thought
crossed
his
brain
he
ceased
his
struggles
abruptly
and
stood
still
panting
for
breath
when
suddenly
a
sound
of
singing
floated
towards
him
oh
for
the
pure
cold
heart
of
the
a
star
above
is
its
only
love
and
one
brief
sigh
of
its
scented
breath
is
all
it
will
ever
know
of
death
oh
for
the
passionless
heart
of
the
he
listened
and
all
power
of
resistance
ebbed
slowly
away
from
him
he
became
perfectly
passive
almost
apathetic
and
yielding
to
the
somewhat
rough
handling
of
his
guide
allowed
himself
to
be
urged
with
silent
rapidity
onward
over
the
thick
sand
till
he
presently
became
conscious
that
he
was
leaving
the
fresh
open
air
and
entering
a
building
of
some
sort
for
his
feet
pressed
hard
earth
and
stone
instead
of
sand
all
at
once
he
was
forcibly
brought
to
a
standstill
and
a
heavy
rolling
noise
and
clang
like
distant
muttered
thunder
resounded
in
his
ears
followed
by
dead
silence
then
his
arm
was
closely
grasped
again
and
he
was
led
on
on
and
on
along
what
seemed
to
be
an
interminable
distance
for
not
a
glimmer
of
light
could
be
seen
under
the
tight
folds
of
the
bandage
across
his
eyes
presently
the
earth
shook
under
him
some
heavy
substance
was
moved
and
there
was
another
booming
thunderous
noise
accompanied
by
the
falling
of
chains

down
down
resistance
was
useless
even
had
he
cared
to
resist
for
he
felt
as
though
twenty
pairs
of
hands
instead
of
one
were
pushing
him
violently
on
all
sides
down
still
down
he
went
dumb
blind
and
helpless
till
at
last
he
was
allowed
to
stop
and
breathe
his
arms
were
released
the
bandage
was
taken
from
his
eyes
the
gag
from
his
mouth
he
was
free
free
yes
but
where
thick
darkness
encompassed
him
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
the
murky
atmosphere
and
felt
nothing

he
cried
the
name
sprang
up
against
the
silence
and
struck
out
numberless
echoes
and
with
the
echoes
came
a
shuddering
sigh
that
was
not
of
them
whispering
charmazel

it
and
a
deadly
fear
born
of

possessed
him

answered
the
penetrating
unknown
voice
and
as
it
thrilled
upon
the
air
like
a
sob
of
pain
a
dim
light
began
to
shine
through
the
gloom
waveringly
at
first
then
more
steadily
till
it
gradually
spread
wide
illuminating
with
a
pale
and
spectral
light
the
place
in
which
he
found
himself
a
place
more
weird
and
wondrous
than
any
mystic
scene
in
he
stumbled
forward
giddily
utterly
bewildered
staring
about
him
like
a
man
in
delirium
and
speechless
with
mingled
horror
and
amazement
he
was
alone
utterly
alone
in
a
vast
square
chamber
the
walls
and
roof
of
which
were
thickly
patterned
and
glistening
with
gold
squares
of
gold
were
set
in
the
very
pavement
on
which
he
trod
and
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
chamber
a
magnificent
sarcophagus
of
solid
gold
encrusted
with
thousands
upon
thousands
of
jewels
which
were
set
upon
it
in
marvellous
and
fantastic
devices
glittered
and
flashed
with
the
hues
of
living
fire
golden
cups
golden
vases
a
golden
suit
of
armor
bracelets
and
chains
of
gold
intermixed
with
gems
were
heaped
up
against
the
walls
and
scattered
on
the
floor
and
a
round
shield
of
ivory
inlaid
with
gold
together
with
a
sword
in
a
jewelled
sheath
were
placed
in
an
upright
position
against
the
head
of
the
sarcophagus
from
whence
all
the
spectral
and
mysterious
light
seemed
to
emerge
with
thickly
beating
heart
and
faltering
pulses
gervase
still
advanced
gazing
half
entranced
half
terrified
at
the
extraordinary
and
sumptuous
splendor
surrounding
him
muttering
almost
unconsciously
as
he
moved
along
a
king
sepulchre
a
warrior
tomb
how
came
i
here
and
why
is
this
a
for
love
as
well
as
death
and
will
she
come
to
me
he
recoiled
suddenly
with
a
violent
start
for
there
like
a
strange
spirit
of
evil
risen
from
the
ground
leaning
against
the
great
gold
sarcophagus
her
exquisite
form
scarcely
concealed
by
the
misty
white
of
her
draperies
her
dark
hair
hanging
like
a
cloud
over
her
shoulders
and
her
black
eyes
aflame
with
wrath
menace
and
passion
stood
the
mysterious
ziska
chapter

stricken
dumb
with
a
ghastly
supernatural
terror
which
far
exceeded
any
ordinary
sense
of
fear
he
gazed
at
her
spellbound
his
blood
freezing
his
very
limbs
stiffening
for
now
now
she
looked
like
the
picture
he
had
painted
of
her
and
death
death
livid
tortured
and
horrible
stared
at
him
from
the
transparent
covering
of
her
exquisitely
tinted
flesh
larger
and
brighter
and
wilder
grew
her
eyes
as
she
fixed
them
on
him
and
her
voice
rang
through
the
silence
with
an
unearthly
resonance
as
she
spoke
and
said
welcome
my
lover
to
this
abode
of
love
welcome
to
these
arms
for
whose
embraces
your
covetous
soul
has
thirsted

take
all
of
me
for
i

so
truly
yours
that
you
can

me
no
not
through
a
thousand

centuries
life
of

of
my
soul

me
as

possess

which
must

on
and
on

leap
to
my

master

king
and

here
here
and
she
smote
her
white
arms
against
her
whiter
bosom
take
all
your
fill
of
burning
wickedness
of
cursed
joy
and
then
sleep
as
you
have
slept
before
these
many
thousand
years
still
mute
and
aghast
he
stared
at
her
his
senses
swam
his
brain
reeled
and
then
slowly
like
the
lifting
of
a
curtain
on
the
last
scene
of
a
dire
tragedy
a
lightning
thought
a
scorching
memory
sprang
into
his
mind
and
overwhelmed
him
like
a
rolling
wave
that
brings
death
in
its
track
with
a
fierce
oath
he
rushed
towards
her
and
seized
her
hands
in
his
hands
cold
as
ice
and
clammy
as
with
the
dews
of
the
grave
ziska
woman
devil
speak
before
you
drive
me
to
madness
what
passion
moves
you
thus
what
mystic
fooling
into
what
place
have
i
been
decoyed
at
your
bidding
why
am
i
brought
hither
speak
speak
or
i
shall
murder
you
nay
she
said
and
her
slight
swaying
form
dilated
and
grew
till
she
seemed
to
rise
up
from
the
very
ground
and
to
tower
above
him
like
an
enraged
demon
evoked
from
mist
or
flame
you
have
done
that
once
to
murder
me
twice
is
beyond
your
power
and
as
she
spoke
her
hands
slipped
from
his
like
the
hands
of
a
corpse
newly
dead
never
again
can
you
hurl
forth
my
anguished
soul
unprepared
to
the
outer
darkness
of
things
invisible
never
again
for
i
am
free
free
with
an
immortal
freedom
free
to
work
out
repentance
or
revenge
even
as
man
is
free
to
shape
his
course
for
good
or
evil
he
chooses
evil
i
choose
revenge
what
place
is
this
you
ask
and
with
a
majestic
gliding
motion
she
advanced
a
little
and
pointed
upward
to
the
sparkling
roof
above
us
the
great
pyramid
lifts
its
summit
to
the
stars
and
here
below
here
where
you
will
presently
lie
my
lover
and
lord
asleep
in
the
delicate
bosom
of
love
here
she
paused
and
a
low
laugh
broke
from
her
lips
then
she
added
slowly
and
impressively
here
is
the
tomb
of
araxes
as
she
spoke
a
creeping
sense
of
coldness
and
horror
stole
into
his
veins
like
the
approach
of
death
the
strange
impressions
he
had
felt
the
haunting
and
confusing
memory
he
had
always
had
of
her
face
and
voice
the
supernatural
theories
he
had
lately
heard
discussed
all
rushed
at
once
upon
his
mind
and
he
uttered
a
loud
involuntary
cry
my
god
what
frenzy
is
this
a
woman
vain
trick
a
fool
mad
scheme
what
is
araxes
to
me
or
i
to
araxes
everything
replied
ziska
the
vindictive
demon
light
in
her
eyes
blazing
with
a
truly
frightful
intensity
inasmuch
as
ye
are
one
and
the
same
the
same
dark
soul
of
sin
unpurged
uncleansed
through
ages
of
eternal
fire
sensualist
voluptuary
accursed
spirit
of
the
man
i
loved
come
forth
from
the
present
come
forth
and
cling
to
me
cling
for
the
whole
forces
of
a
million
universes
shall
not
separate
us
o
eternal
spirits
of
the
dead
and
she
lifted
her
ghostly
white
arms
with
a
wild
gesture
rend
ye
the
veil
declare
to
the
infidel
and
unbeliever
the
truth
of
the
life
beyond
death
the
life
wherein
ye
and
i
dwell
and
work
clamoring
for
late
justice
here
she
sprang
forward
and
caught
the
arm
of
gervase
with
all
the
fierce
eagerness
of
some
ravenous
bird
of
prey
and
as
she
did
so
he
knew
her
grasp
meant
death
remember
the
days
of
old
araxes
look
back
look
back
from
the
present
to
the
past
and
remember
the
crimes
that
are
still
unavenged
remember
the
love
sought
and
won
remember
the
broken
heart
remember
the
ruined
life
remember
the
triumphs
of
war
the
glories
of
conquest
remember
the
lust
of
ambition
the
treachery
the
slaughter
the
blasphemies
against
high
heaven
remember
the
night
of
the
feast
of
osiris
the
feast
of
the
sun
remember
how
awaited
her
lover
singing
alone
for
joy
in
blind
faith
and
blinder
love
his
favorite
song
of
the
the
moon
was
high
as
it
is
now
the
stars
glittered
above
the
pyramids
as
they
glitter
now
in
the
palace
there
was
the
sound
of
music
and
triumph
and
laughter
and
a
whisper
on
the
air
of
the
fickle
heart
and
changeful
mood
of
araxes
of
another
face
which
charmed
him
though
less
fair
than
that
of
remember
remember
and
she
clung
closer
and
closer
as
he
staggered
backward
half
suffocated
by
his
own
emotions
and
the
horror
of
her
touch
remember
the
fierce
word
the
quick
and
murderous
blow
the
plunge
of
the
jewelled
knife
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
passionate
white
bosom
of
charmazel
the
lonely
anguish
in
which
she
died
died
but
to
live
again
and
pursue
her
murderer
to
track
him
down
to
his
grave
wherein
the
king
strewed
gold
and
devils
strewed
curses
down
down
to
the
end
of
all
his
glory
and
conquest
into
the
silence
of
yon
clay
and
out
of
silence
again
into
sound
and
light
and
fire
ever
pursuing
i
have
followed
followed
through
a
thousand
phases
of
existence
and
i
will
follow
still
through
limitless
space
and
endless
time
till
the
great
maker
of
this
terrible
wheel
of
life
himself
shall
say
here
ends
even
the
law
of
vengeance
oh
for
ten
thousand
centuries
more
in
which
to
work
my
passion
and
prove
my
wrong
all
the
treasure
of
love

all
the
hope
of
a
life
betrayed
all
the
salvation

denied
tremble
soul
of
araxes
for
hate
is
eternal
as
love
is
eternal
the
veil
is
down
and
memory
stings
she
turned
her
face
now
spectral
and
pallid
as
a
waning
moon
up
to
him
her
form
grew
thin
and
while
still
retaining
the
transparent
outline
of
its
beauty
and
he
realized
at
last
that
no
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
was
this
that
clung
to
him
but
some
mysterious
bodiless
horror
of
the
supernatural
unguessed
at
by
the
outer
world
of
men
the
dews
of
death
stood
thick
on
his
forehead
there
was
a
straining
agony
at
his
heart
and
his
breath
came
in
quick
convulsive
gasps
but
worse
than
his
physical
torture
was
the
overwhelming
and
convincing
truth
of
the
actual
existence
of
the
spiritual
universe
now
so
suddenly
and
awfully
revealed
what
he
had
all
his
life
denied
was
now
declared
a
certainty
where
he
had
been
deaf
and
blind
he
now
heard
and
saw
ziska
in
very
truth
he
knew
he
remembered
her
in
very
truth
he
knew
he
had
loved
her
in
very
truth
he
knew
he
had
murdered
her
but
another
still
stranger
truth
was
forcing
itself
upon
him
now
and
this
was
that
the
old
love
of
the
old
old
days
was
arising
within
him
in
all
its
strength
once
more
and
that
he
loved
her
still
unreal
and
terrible
as
it
seemed
it
was
nevertheless
a
fact
that
as
he
gazed
upon
her
tortured
face
her
beautiful
anguished
eyes
her
phantom
form
he
felt
that
he
would
give
his
own
soul
to
rescue
hers
and
lift
her
from
the
coils
of
vengeance
into
love
again
her
words
awoke
vibrating
pulsations
of
thought
long
dormant
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
spirit
which
like
so
many
stabbed
him
with
a
myriad
recollections
and
as
a
disguising
cloak
may
fall
from
the
figure
of
a
friend
in
a
masquerade
so
his
personality
dropped
from
him
and
no
longer
had
any
substance
he
recognized
himself
as
araxes
always
the
same
soul
passing
through
a
myriad
changes
and
all
the
links
of
his
past
and
present
were
suddenly
welded
together
in
one
unbroken
chain
stretching
over
thousands
of
years
every
link
of
which
he
was
able
to
count
mark
and
recognize
by
the
dreadful
light
of
that
dumb
comprehension
which
flashes
on
all
parting
souls
at
the
moment
of
dissolution
he
perceived
at
last
that
not
the
body
but
the
spirit
is
the
central
secret
of
life
not
deeds
but
thoughts
evolve
creation
death
that
was
a
name
merely
there
was
no
death
only
a
change
into
some
other
form
of
existence
what
change
what
form
would
be
his
now
this
thought
startled
him
roused
him
and
once
again
the
low
of
his
betrayed
and
murdered
love
thrilled
in
his
ears
soul
of
araxes
cling
to
my
soul
for
this
present
life
is
swiftly
passing
no
more
scorn
of
the
divine
can
stand
whither
we
are
speeding
for
the
terrible
and
eternal
truth
overshadows
us
and
our
destinies
closed
are
the
gates
of
heaven
open
wide
are
the
portals
of
hell
enter
with
me
my
lover
araxes
die
as
i
died
unprepared
and
alone
die
and
pass
out
into
new
life
again
such
life
as
mine
such
torture
as
mine
such
despair
as
mine
such
hate
as
mine
she
ceased
abruptly
for
he
convinced
now
of
the
certainty
of
immortality
was
suddenly
moved
to
a
strange
access
of
courage
and
resolution
something
sweet
and
subtle
stirred
in
him
a
sense
of
power
a
hint
of
joy
which
completely
overcame
all
dread
of
death
old
love
revived
grew
stronger
in
his
soul
and
his
gaze
rested
on
the
shadowy
form
beside
him
no
longer
with
horror
but
with
tenderness
she
was
she
had
been
his
love
the
dearest
portion
of
his
life
once
in
the
time
she
had
been
the
fairest
of
women
and
more
than
fair
she
had
been
faithful
yes
he
remembered
that
as
he
remembered
her
every
curve
in
her
beautiful
body
had
been
a
joy
for
him
alone
and
for
him
alone
her
lips
sweet
and
fresh
as
rosebuds
had
kept
their
kisses
she
had
loved
him
as
few
women
have
either
heart
or
strength
to
love
and
he
had
rewarded
her
fidelity
by
death
and
eternal
torment
a
struggling
cry
escaped
him
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
ziska
forgive
forgive
as
he
uttered
the
words
he
saw
her
wan
face
suddenly
change
all
the
terror
and
torture
passed
from
it
like
a
passing
cloud
beautiful
as
an
angel
it
smiled
upon
him
the
eyes
softened
and
flashed
with
love
the
lips
trembled
the
spectral
form
glowed
with
a
living
luminance
and
a
mystic
glory
glittered
above
the
dusky
hair
filled
with
ecstasy
at
the
sight
of
her
wondrous
loveliness
he
felt
nothing
of
the
coldness
of
death
at
his
heart
a
divine
passion
inspired
him
and
with
the
last
effort
of
his
failing
strength
he
strove
to
gather
all
the
beauty
of
her
being
into
his
embrace
love
love
he
cried
not
hate
but
love
come
back
out
of
the
darkness
soul
of
the
woman
i
wronged
forgive
me
come
back
to
me
hell
or
heaven
what
matters
it
if
we
are
together
come
to
me
come
love
is
stronger
than
hate
speech
failed
him
the
cold
agony
of
death
gripped
at
his
heart
and
struck
him
mute
but
still
he
saw
the
beautiful
passionate
eyes
of
a
forgiving
love
turned
gloriously
upon
him
like
stars
in
the
black
chaos
whither
he
now
seemed
rushing
then
came
a
solemn
surging
sound
as
of
great
wings
beating
on
a
tempestuous
air
and
all
the
light
in
the
tomb
was
suddenly
extinguished
one
instant
more
he
stood
upright
in
the
thick
darkness
then
a
burning
knife
seemed
plunged
into
his
breast
and
he
reeled
forward
and
fell
his
last
hold
on
life
being
the
consciousness
that
soft
arms
were
clasping
him
and
drawing
him
away
away
he
knew
not
whither
and
that
warm
lips
sweet
and
tender
were
closely
pressed
on
his
and
presently
out
of
the
heavy
gloom
came
a
voice
which
said
peace
the
old
gods
are
best
and
the
law
is
made
perfect
a
life
demands
a
life
love
debt
must
be
paid
by
love
the
woman
soul
forgives
the
man
repents
wherefore
they
are
both
released
from
bondage
and
the
memory
of
sin
let
them
go
hence
the
curse
is
lifted
once
more
the
wavering
ghostly
light
gave
luminance
to
the
splendor
of
the
tomb
and
showed
where
fallen
sideways
among
the
golden
treasures
and
mementoes
of
the
past
lay
the
dead
body
of
armand
gervase
above
him
gleamed
the
great
jewelled
sarcophagus
and
within
touch
of
his
passive
hand
was
the
ivory
shield
and
sword
of
araxes
the
spectral
radiance
gleamed
wandered
and
flitted
over
all
things
now
feebly
now
brilliantly
till
finally
flashing
with
a
pale
glare
on
the
dark
dead
face
with
the
proud
closed
lips
and
black
level
brows
it
flickered
out
and
one
of
the
many
countless
mysteries
of
the
great
pyramid
was
again
hidden
in
impenetrable
darkness
vainly
denzil
marray
waited
next
morning
for
his
rival
to
appear
he
paced
up
and
down
impatiently
watching
the
rosy
hues
of
sunrise
spreading
over
the
wide
desert
and
lighting
up
the
massive
features
of
the
sphinx
till
as
hour
after
hour
passed
and
still
gervase
did
not
come
he
hurried
back
to
the
mena
house
hotel
and
meeting
maxwell
dean
on
the
way
to
him
poured
out
his
rage
and
perplexity
i
never
thought
gervase
was
a
coward
he
said
hotly
nor
should
you
think
so
now
returned
the
doctor
with
a
grave
and
preoccupied
air
whatever
his
faults
cowardice
was
not
one
of
them
you
see
i
speak
of
him
in
the
past
tense
i
told
you
your
intended
duel
would
not
come
off
and
i
was
right
denzil
i
do
think
you
will
ever
see
either
armand
gervase
or
the
princess
ziska
again
denzil
started
violently
what
do
you
mean
the
princess
is
here
here
in
this
very
house
is
she
and
dean
sighed
somewhat
impatiently
well
let
us
see
then
turning
to
a
passing
waiter
he
inquired
is
the
princess
ziska
here
still
no
sir
she
left
quite
suddenly
late
last
night
going
on
to
thebes
i
believe
sir
the
doctor
looked
meaningly
at
denzil
you
hear
but
denzil
in
his
turn
was
interrogating
the
waiter
is
gervase
in
his
room
no
sir
he
went
out
about
ten
yesterday
evening
and
i
think
he
is
coming
back
one
of
the
princess
ziska
servants
the
tall
nubian
whom
you
may
have
noticed
sir
brought
a
message
from
him
to
say
that
his
luggage
was
to
be
sent
to
paris
and
that
the
money
for
his
bill
would
be
found
on
his
it
was
all
right
of
course
but
we
thought
it
rather
curious
and
glancing
deferentially
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
questioners
with
a
smile
the
waiter
went
on
his
way
they
have
fled
together
said
denzil
then
in
choked
accents
of
fury
by
heaven
if
i
had
guessed
the
plan
already
formed
in
his
treacherous
mind
i
would
never
have
shaken
hands
with
gervase
last
night
oh
you
did
shake
hands
queried
dean
meditatively
well
there
was
no
harm
in
that
you
were
right
you
and
gervase
will
meet
no
more
in
this
life
believe
me
he
and
the
princess
ziska
have
undoubtedly
as
you
say
fled
together
but
not
to
thebes
he
paused
a
moment
then
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
denzil
shoulder
let
us
go
back
to
cairo
my
boy
and
from
thence
as
soon
as
possible
to
england
we
shall
all
be
better
away
from
this
terrible
land
where
the
dead
have
far
more
power
than
the
living
denzil
stared
at
him
uncomprehendingly
you
talk
in
riddles
he
said
irritably
do
you
think
i
shall
let
gervase
escape
me
i
will
track
him
wherever
he
has
gone
i
daresay
i
shall
find
him
in
paris
dean
took
one
or
two
slow
turns
up
and
down
the
corridor
where
they
were
conversing
then
stopping
abruptly
looked
his
young
friend
full
and
steadily
in
the
eyes
come
come
denzil
no
more
of
this
folly
he
said
gently
why
should
you
entertain
these
ideas
of
vengeance
against
gervase
he
has
really
done
you
no
harm
he
was
the
natural
mate
of
the
woman
you
imagined
you
loved
the
response
to
her
query
the
other
half
of
her
being
and
that
she
was
and
is
his
destiny
and
he
hers
should
not
excite
your
envy
or
hatred
i
say
you
imagined
you
loved
the
princess
ziska
it
was
a
young
man
hot
freak
of
passion
for
an
almost
matchless
beauty
but
no
more
than
that
and
if
you
would
be
frank
with
yourself
you
know
that
passion
has
already
cooled
i
repeat
you
will
never
see
gervase
or
the
princess
ziska
again
in
this
life
so
make
the
best
of
it
perhaps
you
have
assisted
him
to
escape
me
said
denzil
frigidly
dean
smiled
that
rather
a
rough
speech
denzil
but
never
mind
he
returned
your
pride
is
wounded
and
you
are
still
sore
suspect
me
as
you
please
make
me
out
a
new
pandarus
if
you
like
i
shall
not
be
offended
but
you
know
for
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
never
interfere
in
love
matters
they
are
too
explosive
too
vitally
dangerous
outsiders
ought
never
to
meddle
with
them
and
i
never
do
come
back
with
me
to
cairo
and
when
we
are
once
more
safely
established
on
the
solid
and
unromantic
isles
of
britain
you
will
forget
all
about
the
princess
ziska
or
if
you
do
remember
her
it
will
only
be
as
a
dream
in
the
night
a
kind
of
vague
shadow
and
uncertainty
which
will
never
seriously
trouble
your
mind
you
look
incredulous
i
tell
you
at
your
age
love
is
little
more
than
a
vision
you
must
wait
a
few
years
yet
before
it
becomes
a
reality
and
then
heaven
help
you
denzil
for
you
will
be
a
troublesome
fellow
to
deal
with
meanwhile
let
us
get
back
to
cairo
and
see
helen
somewhat
soothed
by
the
doctor
and
a
trifle
ashamed
of
his
wrath
denzil
yielded
and
the
evening
saw
them
both
back
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
where
of
course
the
news
of
the
sudden
disappearance
of
armand
gervase
with
the
princess
ziska
created
the
utmost
excitement
helen
murray
shivered
and
grew
pale
as
death
when
she
heard
it
lively
old
lady
fulkeward
simpered
and
giggled
and
declared
it
was
the
most
delightful
thing
she
had
ever
heard
of
an
elopement
in
the
desert
was
so
exquisitely
romantic
sir
chetwynd
lyle
wrote
a
conventional
and
stilted
account
of
it
for
his
paper
and
ponderously
opined
that
the
immorality
of
frenchmen
was
absolutely
beyond
any
decent
journalist
powers
of
description
lady
chetwynd
lyle
on
the
contrary
said
that
the
scandal
was
not
the
fault
of
gervase
it
was
all
that
horrid
woman
who
had
thrown
herself
at
his
head
ross
courtney
thought
the
whole
thing
was
queer
and
young
lord
fulkeward
said
there
was
something
about
it
he
did
quite
understand
something
deep
which
his
aristocratic
quality
of
intelligence
could
not
fathom
and
society
talked
and
gossiped
till
paris
and
london
caught
the
rumor
and
the
name
of
the
famous
french
artist
who
had
so
strangely
vanished
from
the
scene
of
his
triumphs
with
a
beautiful
woman
whom
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
before
was
soon
in
everybody
mouth
no
trace
of
him
or
of
the
princess
ziska
could
be
discovered
his
portmanteau
contained
no
letters
or
papers
nothing
but
a
few
clothes
his
and
easel
were
sent
on
to
his
deserted
studio
in
paris
and
also
a
blank
square
of
canvas
on
which
as
dean
and
others
knew
had
once
been
the
portrait
of
the
princess
but
that
appalling
first
sketch
was
wiped
out
and
clean
gone
as
though
it
had
never
been
painted
and
dean
called
attention
to
the
fact
but
denzil
thought
nothing
of
it
as
he
imagined
that
gervase
himself
had
obliterated
it
before
leaving
cairo
a
few
of
the
curious
among
the
gossips
went
to
see
the
house
the
princess
had
lately
occupied
where
she
had
received
society
and
managed
to
shock
it
as
well
it
was
shut
up
and
looked
as
if
it
had
not
been
inhabited
for
years
and
the
gossips
said
it
was
strange
very
strange
and
confessed
themselves
utterly
mystified
but
the
fact
remained
that
gervase
had
disappeared
and
the
princess
ziska
with
him
however
said
society
they
ca
possibly
hide
themselves
for
long
two
such
remarkable
personalities
are
bound
to
appear
again
somewhere
i
daresay
we
shall
come
across
them
in
paris
or
on
the
riviera
the
world
is
much
too
small
for
the
holding
of
a
secret
and
presently
with
the
approach
of
spring
and
the
gradual
of
the
cairo
season
denzil
murray
and
his
sister
sailed
from
alexandria
en
route
for
venice
dean
accompanied
them
so
did
the
fulkewards
and
ross
courtney
the
went
by
a
different
steamer
old
lady
fulkeward
being
quite
too
much
for
the
patience
of
those
sweet
but
still
unengaged
girls
muriel
and
dolly
one
night
when
the
great
ship
was
speeding
swiftly
over
a
calm
sea
and
denzil
lost
in
sorrowful
meditation
was
gazing
out
over
the
trackless
ocean
with
pained
and
passionate
eyes
which
could
see
nothing
but
the
witching
and
exquisite
beauty
of
the
princess
ziska
now
possessed
and
enjoyed
by
gervase
dean
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
said
denzil
have
you
ever
read
shakespeare
denzil
started
and
forced
a
smile
why
yes
of
course
then
you
know
the
lines
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
the
princess
ziska
was
one
of
those
denzil
regarded
him
in
wonderment
what
do
you
mean
oh
of
course
you
will
think
me
insane
said
the
doctor
resignedly
people
always
take
refuge
in
thinking
that
those
who
tell
them
uncomfortable
truths
are
lunatics
you
heard
me
talk
of
ghosts
ghosts
that
walk
and
move
about
us
like
human
beings
and
they
are
generally
very
brilliant
and
clever
impersonations
of
humanity
too
and
that
nevertheless
are
not
human
denzil
assented
the
princess
ziska
was
a
ghost
concluded
the
doctor
folding
his
arms
very
tightly
across
his
chest
and
nodding
defiantly
nonsense
cried
denzil
you
are
mad
precisely
the
remark
i
thought
you
would
make
and
dean
unfolded
his
arms
again
and
smiled
triumphantly
therefore
my
dear
boy
let
us
for
the
future
avoid
this
subject
i
know
what
i
know
i
can
distinguish
phantoms
from
reality
and
i
am
not
deceived
by
appearances
but
the
world
prefers
ignorance
to
knowledge
and
even
so
let
it
be
next
time
i
meet
a
ghost
i
keep
my
own
counsel
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
you
remember
i
told
you
i
was
hunting
down
that
warrior
of
old
time
araxes
denzil
nodded
a
trifle
impatiently
well
resumed
the
doctor
slowly
before
we
left
egypt
i
found
him
but
how
i
found
him
and
where
is
my
secret
society
still
speaks
occasionally
of
armand
gervase
and
wonders
in
its
feeble
way
when
he
will
be
tired
of
the
egyptian
beauty
he
ran
away
with
or
she
of
him
society
never
thinks
very
far
or
cares
very
much
for
anything
long
but
it
does
certainly
expect
to
see
the
once
famous
french
artist
turn
up
suddenly
either
in
his
old
quarters
in
paris
or
in
one
or
the
other
of
the
fashionable
resorts
of
the
riviera
that
he
should
be
dead
has
never
occurred
to
anyone
except
perhaps
maxwell
dean
but
dean
has
grown
extremely
reticent
almost
surly
and
never
answers
any
questions
concerning
his
scientific
theory
of
ghosts
a
work
which
when
published
created
a
great
deal
of
excitement
owing
to
its
singularity
and
novelty
of
treatment
there
was
the
usual
from
the
donkeys
in
the
literary
pasture
who
fondly
imagined
their
brayings
deserved
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
serious
opinion
and
then
after
a
while
the
book
fell
into
the
hands
of
scientists
only
men
who
are
beginning
to
understand
the
discretion
of
silence
and
to
hold
their
tongues
as
closely
as
the
egyptian
priests
of
old
did
aware
that
the
great
majority
of
men
are
never
ripe
for
knowledge
quite
lately
dean
attended
two
weddings
one
being
that
of
old
lady
fulkeward
who
has
married
a
very
pretty
young
fellow
of
whose
dearest
consideration
in
life
is
the
shape
of
his
the
other
that
of
denzil
murray
who
has
wedded
the
perfectly
and
virtuous
if
somewhat
daughter
of
his
neighbor
in
the
highlands
concerning
his
egyptian
experience
he
never
speaks
he
lives
the
ordinary
life
of
the
scottish
looking
after
his
tenantry
considering
the
crops
preserving
the
game
and
clearing
fallen
timber
and
if
the
glowing
face
of
the
beautiful
ziska
ever
floats
before
his
memory
it
is
only
in
a
vague
dream
from
which
he
quickly
rouses
himself
with
a
troubled
sigh
his
sister
helen
has
never
married
lord
fulkeward
proposed
to
her
but
was
gently
rejected
whereupon
the
disconsolate
young
nobleman
took
a
journey
to
the
states
and
married
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire
instead
sir
chetwynd
lyle
and
his
spouse
still
thrive
and
grow
fat
on
the
proceeds
of
the
daily
dial
and
there
is
faint
hope
that
one
of
their
girls
will
wed
an
aspiring
journalist
a
bold
adventurer
who
wants
a
share
in
the
paper
somehow
even
if
he
has
to
marry
muriel
or
dolly
in
order
to
get
it
ross
courtney
is
the
only
man
of
the
party
once
assembled
at
the
gezireh
palace
hotel
who
still
goes
to
cairo
every
winter
fascinated
thither
by
an
annually
recurring
dim
notion
that
he
may
discover
traces
of
the
lost
armand
gervase
and
the
princess
ziska
and
he
frequently
accompanies
the
numerous
who
season
after
season
drive
from
cairo
to
the
pyramids
and
take
pleasure
in
staring
at
the
sphinx
with
all
the
impertinence
common
to
pigmies
when
contemplating
greatness
but
more
riddles
than
that
of
the
sphinx
are
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
sandy
desert
and
more
unsolved
problems
lie
in
the
recesses
of
the
past
than
even
the
restless
and
inquiring
spirit
of
modern
times
will
ever
discover
and
if
it
should
ever
chance
that
in
days
to
come
the
secret
of
the
movable
floor
of
the
great
pyramid
should
be
found
and
the
lost
treasures
of
egypt
brought
to
light
there
will
probably
be
much
discussion
and
marvel
concerning
the
golden
tomb
of
araxes
for
the
hieroglyphs
on
the
jewelled
sarcophagus
speak
of
him
thus
and
say
araxes
was
a
man
of
might
far
exceeding
in
strength
and
beauty
the
common
sons
of
men
great
in
war
invincible
in
love
he
did
excel
in
deeds
of
courage
and
of
conquest
and
for
whatsoever
sins
he
did
in
the
secret
weakness
of
humanity
commit
the
gods
must
judge
him
but
in
all
that
may
befit
a
warrior
amenhotep
the
king
doth
give
him
honor
and
to
the
spirits
of
darkness
and
of
light
his
soul
is
here
commended
to
its
rest
thus
much
of
the
fierce
dead
hero
of
old
time
but
of
the
mouldering
corpse
that
lies
on
the
golden
floor
of
the
same
tomb
its
skeleton
hand
touching
almost
grasping
the
sword
of
araxes
what
shall
be
said
nothing
since
the
old
and
the
new
the
past
and
the
present
are
but
as
one
moment
in
the
countings
of
eternity
and
even
with
a
late
repentance
love
pardons
all
finis
