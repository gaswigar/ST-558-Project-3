it
may
be
that
she
is
working
it
was
raining
drearily
and
but
few
people
were
abroad
that
is
few
comparatively
speaking
though
the
streets
seemed
full
of
hurrying
dripping
mortals
in
the
large
store
business
was
by
no
means
so
brisk
as
on
sunny
days
and
one
of
the
younger
clerks
whose
station
was
near
a
window
looking
out
upon
the
thoroughfare
had
time
to
stand
gazing
at
the
they
did
not
seem
to
interest
him
particularly
or
else
they
puzzled
him
his
young
handsome
face
wore
a
thoughtful
look
almost
a
troubled
expression
about
the
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
gazing
beyond
the
just
across
the
aisle
from
him
a
lady
seated
in
one
of
the
easy
chairs
set
for
the
accommodation
of
shoppers
waited
and
watched
him
a
young
and
pretty
woman
tastefully
even
elegantly
dressed
yet
her
costume
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
stormy
day
the
young
man
face
seemed
to
have
special
interest
for
her
though
he
apparently
was
unaware
of
her
existence
a
close
observer
would
have
discovered
that
she
was
watching
him
with
deeply
interested
eyes
whatever
served
to
hold
the
thoughts
of
the
young
man
apparently
grew
in
perplexity
for
the
troubled
look
continually
deepened
at
last
forgetting
the
possible
listener
he
addressed
the
dripping
clouds
perhaps
at
least
he
was
looking
at
them
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
but
something
ought
to
be
done
it
is
worse
than
folly
to
expect
good
from
the
way
that
things
are
now
managed
ester
would
have
known
just
what
and
how
and
how
interested
she
would
have
been
i
try
to
do
her
work
and
to
the
time
but
the
simple
truth
is
i
do
know
how
and
nobody
else
seems
these
sentences
were
not
given
all
at
once
but
murmured
from
time
to
time
at
his
unsympathetic
audience
outside
patter
patter
patter
drip
drip
drip
steady
uncompromising
business
it
was
all
the
answer
the
clouds
vouchsafed
him
with
the
listener
inside
it
was
different
the
interested
look
changed
to
an
eager
one
she
left
her
seat
and
moved
toward
the
absorbed
young
man
breaking
in
on
his
reverie
with
the
clearest
of
voices
i
beg
your
pardon
but
are
you
thinking
of
your
sister
you
are
ried
i
believe
i
have
heard
of
your
sister
life
and
of
her
beautiful
death
through
a
dear
friend
of
my
husband
who
loved
ester
i
have
always
wanted
to
know
more
about
her
i
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
you
so
i
might
ask
you
things
about
her
i
am
waiting
now
for
my
husband
to
come
and
introduce
us
but
perhaps
it
is
necessary
do
you
know
who
i
am
it
is
roberts
i
believe
the
young
man
said
struggling
with
his
astonishment
and
embarrassment
yes
and
you
are
alfred
ried
well
now
we
know
each
other
without
any
further
ceremony
will
you
tell
me
a
little
about
your
sister
ried
you
were
thinking
of
her
just
i
was
missing
her
just
now
said
he
trying
to
smile
as
i
very
often
am
i
was
a
little
fellow
when
she
died
but
the
older
i
grow
the
more
difficult
i
find
it
to
see
how
the
world
can
spare
her
she
was
so
full
of
plans
for
work
and
there
are
so
few
like
it
may
be
that
she
is
working
still
in
the
person
of
her
he
shook
his
head
energetically
though
his
face
flushed
no
i
can
only
blunder
vaguely
over
work
that
i
know
she
with
her
energetic
ways
and
quick
wits
could
have
done
and
done
well
it
happens
that
she
was
especially
interested
in
a
class
of
people
of
whom
i
know
something
they
need
help
and
i
do
know
how
to
help
them
it
seems
to
me
that
she
could
have
done
will
you
tell
me
who
the
people
are
it
is
a
set
of
boys
for
whom
nobody
cares
he
said
speaking
sadly
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
there
could
ever
have
been
a
time
when
anybody
cared
for
them
though
i
suppose
their
mothers
did
when
they
were
little
thus
spoke
the
ignorant
young
man
ignorant
of
the
depths
to
which
sin
will
sink
human
nature
but
rich
in
the
memory
of
i
think
of
my
sister
ester
in
connection
with
them
he
said
speaking
apologetically
because
she
was
peculiarly
interested
in
wild
young
fellows
like
them
she
thought
they
might
be
reached
that
there
might
be
ways
invented
for
reaching
them
such
as
had
not
been
yet
she
had
plans
and
they
were
good
ones
i
thought
so
then
little
fellow
that
i
was
and
i
think
so
now
only
nobody
is
at
work
carrying
them
out
and
i
wonder
sometimes
if
ester
could
have
been
needed
in
heaven
half
as
much
as
she
is
needed
on
earth
she
used
to
talk
to
me
a
great
deal
about
what
might
be
done
i
think
now
that
she
wanted
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
taking
up
some
of
the
work
that
she
would
have
done
but
she
mistook
her
material
i
ca
do
are
you
sure
you
are
young
yet
and
besides
you
may
be
doing
more
than
you
think
could
i
help
what
is
there
that
needs
doing
for
these
particular
young
men
everything
he
said
excitedly
if
you
should
see
them
you
would
get
a
faint
idea
of
it
they
come
occasionally
down
to
the
at
the
south
end
in
fact
they
come
quite
frequently
though
i
sure
i
ca
see
why
it
certainly
is
for
any
good
that
they
get
their
actions
roberts
surpass
anything
that
i
ever
who
is
their
teacher
that
would
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
they
have
a
different
teacher
every
sabbath
no
one
is
willing
to
undertake
the
class
twice
they
have
tried
all
the
teachers
who
attend
regularly
and
several
who
have
volunteered
for
once
and
never
would
attempt
it
a
second
time
just
now
there
is
no
one
who
will
make
a
have
you
tried
he
shook
his
head
emphatically
i
know
at
least
so
much
why
roberts
some
of
them
are
as
old
as
i
and
indeed
i
think
one
or
two
are
older
no
we
have
secured
the
best
teachers
that
we
could
for
them
but
each
one
has
been
a
failure
i
suppose
they
must
go
where
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
an
awful
question
where
they
go
roberts
if
we
let
them
slip
now
he
was
tremendously
in
earnest
one
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
had
studied
the
possibilities
and
felt
the
danger
suppose
i
try
to
help
shall
i
come
and
take
that
class
next
sabbath
this
simple
question
brought
the
young
man
suddenly
from
the
heights
of
his
excitement
into
visible
embarrassment
he
looked
down
on
the
small
fair
lady
reaching
hardly
to
his
shoulder
attired
in
that
unmistakable
way
which
bespeaks
the
lady
of
wealth
and
culture
and
could
imagine
nothing
more
incongruous
than
to
have
her
seated
before
that
class
of
swearing
spitting
fighting
boys
not
that
her
wealth
or
her
culture
was
an
objection
but
she
looked
so
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
imagined
their
teacher
must
be
she
was
so
small
so
frail
so
fair
and
sweet
and
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
the
great
wicked
world
and
especially
of
those
great
wicked
boys
what
could
he
say
to
her
he
was
so
manifestly
embarrassed
that
the
small
lady
laughed
you
think
i
can
not
do
it
she
said
almost
gayly
he
hastened
to
answer
her
indeed
you
have
no
idea
of
the
sort
of
class
it
is
i
have
given
you
no
conception
of
it
i
can
not
you
would
think
yourself
before
a
set
of
uncaged
yes
and
in
case
of
failure
i
should
only
be
where
the
others
are
who
have
tried
and
failed
if
you
will
introduce
me
and
your
superintendent
will
let
me
i
mean
to
try
and
that
will
relieve
you
of
the
dilemma
of
being
entirely
without
a
teacher
for
young
ried
had
nothing
to
say
he
thought
the
attempt
a
piece
of
folly
a
worse
than
useless
experiment
but
how
was
he
to
say
so
to
the
wife
of
his
employer
that
gentleman
appeared
just
then
making
haste
i
was
unavoidably
detained
he
explained
i
feared
you
would
grow
weary
of
waiting
ah
ried
my
wife
has
introduced
herself
i
see
is
he
the
young
man
you
were
speaking
of
roberts
the
very
young
man
ester
ried
brother
he
does
know
how
glad
i
am
to
have
met
him
some
day
when
we
are
better
acquainted
and
you
trust
me
more
fully
i
am
going
to
tell
you
how
i
became
so
deeply
interested
in
your
dear
sister
meantime
this
little
matter
should
be
definitely
settled
roberts
i
have
invited
myself
to
take
a
class
down
at
the
south
end
have
you
indeed
roberts
spoke
heartily
and
seemed
by
no
means
dismayed
only
a
trifle
perplexed
as
to
details
how
can
we
manage
it
flossy
my
prison
class
takes
me
in
an
opposite
direction
at
the
same
hour
you
yes
i
thought
of
that
i
propose
to
ask
ried
to
call
for
me
and
show
me
the
way
and
vouch
for
my
good
intentions
after
i
reach
there
do
you
suppose
he
will
do
it
she
looked
smilingly
from
her
husband
to
young
ried
and
both
waited
for
his
answer
i
obey
directions
he
said
bowing
respectfully
to
roberts
am
i
to
have
the
honor
of
being
detailed
for
that
service
so
roberts
says
was
the
reply
and
then
the
merchant
took
his
wife
away
to
their
waiting
carriage
that
had
drawn
up
before
the
door
leaving
alfred
ried
if
the
truth
must
be
told
in
a
fume
much
she
knows
what
she
is
talking
about
he
said
jerking
certain
boxes
out
of
their
places
on
the
shelves
and
then
banging
them
back
again
seeming
to
suppose
that
he
was
by
this
process
putting
his
department
in
order
for
closing
little
bit
of
a
doll
they
will
tear
her
into
ribbons
metaphorically
if
not
literally
before
this
time
she
thinks
because
she
is
the
wife
of
evan
roberts
the
great
merchant
she
can
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
and
that
people
will
respect
her
she
has
never
had
anything
to
do
with
a
set
of
fellows
who
care
less
than
nothing
about
money
and
position
except
to
be
ten
times
more
insolent
and
outrageous
in
their
conduct
than
they
would
if
she
had
less
of
it
i
shall
feel
like
a
born
idiot
in
presenting
this
pretty
little
doll
to
teach
that
class
durant
will
think
i
have
lost
what
few
wits
i
had
what
can
possess
the
woman
to
want
to
try
it
is
just
because
she
has
no
conception
of
what
she
is
about
but
roberts
must
know
i
wonder
what
he
means
by
permitting
it
in
very
much
the
same
state
of
mind
did
our
young
man
pilot
his
new
and
recruit
into
the
crowded
mission
rooms
of
the
south
end
on
the
following
sabbath
afternoon
she
looked
not
one
whit
less
able
to
compete
with
the
terrors
which
awaited
the
teacher
of
the
formidable
class
her
dress
was
simplicity
itself
according
to
roberts
ideas
of
simplicity
yet
from
the
row
of
ostrich
tips
that
bobbed
and
nodded
at
each
other
all
around
the
front
of
her
velvet
hat
to
the
buttons
of
her
boots
she
seemed
to
bring
a
new
atmosphere
into
the
room
yesterday
rain
was
over
and
the
pleasant
south
windows
were
aglow
with
sunshine
as
roberts
sat
down
the
sunbeams
came
and
played
about
her
face
and
she
seemed
in
keeping
with
them
and
with
nothing
else
around
her
the
superintendent
bestowed
curious
glances
on
her
during
the
opening
exercises
he
had
seen
the
shadow
on
young
ried
face
when
he
seated
her
and
had
found
time
to
question
whom
have
we
here
mrs
evan
roberts
she
wants
to
try
the
vacant
class
did
not
ask
her
durant
she
invited
durant
looked
over
at
her
and
tried
to
keep
his
eyes
from
smiling
she
looks
very
diminutive
in
every
way
for
such
an
undertaking
they
will
frighten
her
out
before
she
commences
will
they
not
i
presume
so
but
i
did
know
what
to
do
she
wanted
to
come
and
i
could
not
tell
her
she
must
no
of
course
the
occasion
is
too
rare
to
lose
very
few
people
ask
the
privilege
of
trying
that
class
there
is
no
teacher
for
them
and
your
roberts
must
learn
by
experience
that
some
things
are
more
difficult
than
others
i
will
let
her
try
meantime
the
boys
of
the
dreaded
class
were
studying
the
new
face
she
was
the
only
person
not
already
seated
before
a
class
and
they
naturally
judged
that
she
was
to
be
their
next
victim
they
looked
at
her
and
then
at
one
another
and
winked
and
coughed
and
sneezed
and
nudged
elbows
and
giggled
outright
every
one
of
them
meantime
chewing
tobacco
with
all
their
might
and
expectorating
freely
wherever
he
judged
it
would
be
most
offensive
alfred
ried
watched
them
inwardly
groaning
being
used
to
their
faces
he
could
plainly
read
that
they
anticipated
a
richer
time
than
usual
and
rejoiced
greatly
over
the
youth
and
beauty
of
their
victim
but
young
ried
was
not
the
only
one
who
watched
roberts
without
seeming
to
be
aware
of
their
presence
lost
not
a
wriggle
or
a
nudge
she
was
studying
her
material
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
startled
her
not
a
little
they
represented
a
different
type
of
humanity
from
her
chautauqua
boys
or
her
boys
in
the
old
church
at
home
rather
an
advanced
stage
of
both
those
types
when
durant
came
toward
her
the
look
on
his
face
was
not
reassuring
it
so
plainly
said
that
he
expected
failure
and
was
sorry
for
her
as
well
as
for
himself
however
with
as
good
grace
as
he
could
assume
he
led
her
to
the
seat
prepared
for
the
teacher
and
gave
her
a
formal
introduction
boys
this
is
roberts
who
is
willing
to
try
to
teach
you
i
you
would
show
her
that
you
know
how
to
behave
roberts
wished
that
he
had
left
her
to
introduce
herself
or
that
he
had
said
almost
anything
rather
than
what
he
did
the
mischievous
gleam
in
several
pairs
of
eyes
said
that
they
meant
to
show
her
something
that
they
considered
far
more
interesting
than
that
many
were
the
sympathetic
glances
that
were
bestowed
on
the
young
and
pretty
lady
as
she
went
to
her
task
as
for
alfred
ried
there
was
more
than
sympathy
in
his
face
he
was
vexed
with
the
young
volunteer
and
vexed
with
himself
he
told
himself
savagely
that
this
was
what
came
of
his
silly
habit
of
thinking
aloud
if
only
he
had
kept
his
anxieties
about
that
class
to
himself
roberts
would
never
have
heard
of
it
and
been
tempted
to
put
herself
in
such
a
ridiculous
position
and
if
this
episode
did
not
break
him
of
the
habit
he
did
not
know
what
would
he
was
presently
however
given
a
class
of
small
boys
with
enough
of
original
and
acquired
depravity
about
them
to
keep
him
intensely
employed
and
the
entire
school
settled
to
work
chapter
ii
what
did
it
all
amount
to
anyhow
settled
that
is
so
far
as
the
class
of
boys
in
the
corner
would
permit
the
use
of
that
term
had
not
settled
in
the
least
two
of
them
indulged
in
a
louder
burst
of
laughter
than
before
just
as
roberts
took
her
seat
yet
her
face
was
in
no
wise
ruffled
good
afternoon
she
said
with
as
much
courtesy
as
she
would
have
used
in
addressing
gentlemen
i
wonder
if
you
know
that
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
great
city
you
are
almost
the
first
acquaintances
that
i
am
making
among
the
young
people
and
i
have
a
fancy
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
all
for
my
friends
suppose
we
enter
into
a
compact
to
be
excellent
and
faithful
friends
to
one
another
what
do
you
say
what
were
they
to
say
they
were
slightly
taken
back
surprised
into
listening
quietly
to
the
close
of
the
strange
sentence
and
then
giving
no
answer
beyond
violent
nudges
and
what
did
she
mean
was
she
chaffing
them
this
was
unlike
the
opening
of
any
lesson
it
certainly
could
not
be
the
first
question
on
the
nor
did
it
sound
like
certain
admonitions
to
try
to
improve
the
opportunity
and
learn
all
that
they
with
each
of
these
commencements
they
were
entirely
familiar
but
this
was
something
new
do
you
agree
to
the
compact
she
asked
while
they
waited
her
face
bright
with
smiles
dunno
about
that
said
one
whom
she
very
soon
discovered
occupied
the
position
of
a
ringleader
as
a
general
thing
we
like
to
be
kind
of
careful
about
our
friendships
we
might
strike
something
that
quite
the
thing
with
people
in
our
position
you
ca
be
too
careful
in
a
big
city
you
it
is
impossible
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
impishness
with
which
this
impudent
answer
was
jerked
out
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
others
who
laughed
immoderately
it
suited
roberts
to
treat
the
reply
with
perfect
seriousness
and
composure
that
is
very
true
she
said
courteously
but
at
the
same
time
i
venture
to
hope
that
since
you
know
nothing
ill
of
me
as
yet
you
will
receive
me
into
a
sort
of
conditional
friendship
with
the
understanding
that
i
remain
your
friend
until
i
am
guilty
of
some
conduct
that
ought
to
justify
you
in
deserting
me
i
am
sure
you
can
not
object
to
that
and
now
if
we
are
to
be
friends
we
should
know
each
other
names
i
am
evan
roberts
and
i
live
at
no
east
street
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
at
my
house
whenever
you
would
like
to
call
on
me
now
will
one
of
you
be
kind
enough
to
introduce
himself
and
the
class
perhaps
you
will
introduce
me
to
your
friends
she
looked
directly
at
the
ringleader
certainly
certainly
mum
he
replied
briskly
this
is
mr
carrot
pumpkins
at
your
service
mum
this
fellow
on
my
left
i
mean
rather
a
queer
name
i
dare
say
you
think
it
all
came
of
his
being
fond
of
sitting
astride
of
a
pumpkin
when
he
was
a
little
shaver
and
of
his
hair
being
exactly
the
color
of
carrots
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
and
this
fellow
on
my
right
is
champion
chawer
so
called
because
he
can
make
the
biggest
run
on
tobacco
of
any
of
the
set
taking
him
day
in
and
day
out
that
fellow
at
your
elbow
is
jim
we
do
call
him
because
he
does
stay
long
enough
in
one
place
to
have
it
tacked
on
to
him
he
is
such
a
slippery
scamp
that
an
eel
is
nowhere
compared
to
during
this
rapid
flow
of
words
the
listeners
who
evidently
admired
their
leader
became
so
convulsed
with
laughter
as
to
lose
all
vestige
of
respectability
and
durant
disturbed
face
appeared
in
view
boys
this
is
perfectly
disgraceful
he
said
speaking
in
sharp
and
tones
perfectly
disgraceful
i
do
know
why
you
wish
to
come
here
to
disturb
us
in
this
way
sabbath
after
sabbath
but
we
have
really
endured
enough
there
is
a
policeman
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
he
can
easily
call
others
to
his
help
so
now
if
you
wish
to
remain
here
you
must
behave
during
the
deliverance
of
this
sentence
some
of
the
boys
gave
mimic
groans
one
of
them
whistled
and
others
kept
up
a
running
comment
a
policeman
oh
good
that
little
duffer
i
know
we
seen
him
before
would
mind
giving
him
a
chase
just
for
exercise
you
know
i
say
boys
let
cut
and
run
the
whole
caboodle
of
us
we
can
jump
these
seats
at
one
bound
and
take
the
little
woman
along
on
our
shoulders
for
a
ride
shall
we
do
it
this
from
the
leader
who
in
time
came
to
be
known
as
nimble
bah
no
replied
a
third
let
stick
it
out
and
see
what
she
got
to
say
she
a
new
party
besides
we
ca
give
her
the
slip
in
that
way
we
friends
of
hers
you
mrs
roberts
said
the
distressed
durant
in
a
not
very
good
undertone
i
think
you
will
have
to
give
it
up
they
are
worse
than
usual
this
morning
we
have
endured
much
from
them
and
i
must
say
that
my
patience
is
exhausted
will
you
not
take
the
seat
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
not
unless
they
wish
me
the
people
who
had
known
flossy
shipley
well
would
have
detected
a
curious
little
quiver
in
her
voice
which
meant
that
she
was
making
a
strong
effort
at
but
a
stranger
would
hardly
have
observed
it
do
you
wish
me
to
go
away
young
gentlemen
the
scamps
thus
appealed
to
looked
at
one
another
again
as
if
in
doubt
what
to
say
this
again
was
new
ground
to
them
policemen
they
were
accustomed
to
at
last
nimble
dick
made
answer
no
i
bound
if
we
do
it
comes
the
nearest
to
looking
like
a
lark
of
anything
that
we
have
had
in
a
long
time
i
say
parson
go
off
about
your
business
and
let
us
alone
we
was
having
a
good
time
getting
acquainted
till
you
come
and
spoiled
it
we
be
as
sober
as
nine
deacons
at
a
and
look
out
how
you
insult
this
young
woman
she
a
friend
of
ours
and
we
bound
to
protect
her
no
asking
of
her
to
change
her
seat
she
going
to
sit
right
here
to
the
end
of
the
durant
looked
his
willingness
to
summon
the
police
at
once
but
roberts
voice
evenly
poised
now
took
up
the
story
thank
you
then
i
will
stay
and
since
it
is
getting
late
suppose
we
lose
no
more
time
there
was
something
about
which
i
wanted
to
tell
you
but
a
few
evenings
ago
i
attended
a
gathering
where
i
saw
some
very
singular
things
a
gentleman
in
the
party
was
tied
with
a
strong
rope
hands
and
feet
as
firmly
as
two
men
could
tie
him
people
who
knew
how
to
tie
knots
and
they
did
their
best
yet
while
we
stood
looking
at
him
he
shook
his
hand
free
and
held
it
out
to
them
how
do
you
think
it
was
done
sham
knots
said
one
no
for
my
husband
was
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
tied
him
and
he
assured
me
that
he
tied
the
rope
as
firmly
as
he
could
besides
more
wonderful
things
than
that
were
done
i
tied
my
own
handkerchief
into
at
least
a
dozen
very
hard
knots
and
gave
it
to
him
and
i
saw
him
put
it
in
a
glass
of
water
then
seize
it
and
shake
it
out
and
the
knots
were
gone
i
saw
him
take
two
clean
glasses
and
pour
water
from
a
pitcher
into
one
and
it
seemed
to
turn
instantly
to
wine
then
he
poured
that
glass
of
wine
into
the
other
empty
glass
and
immediately
it
turned
back
to
water
or
seemed
to
dozens
of
other
strange
things
he
did
i
should
really
like
to
tell
you
about
them
all
i
will
at
some
other
time
but
just
now
i
think
you
would
like
to
know
he
did
he
did
them
as
if
you
could
tell
you
tell
pitch
in
mum
i
like
to
hear
that
part
myself
these
were
some
of
the
eager
answers
had
the
little
teacher
under
the
embarrassments
of
the
occasion
taken
leave
of
her
senses
actually
she
was
bending
forward
opened
bible
turned
face
downward
on
her
knee
engaged
in
describing
in
somewhat
minute
detail
the
explanations
of
certain
performances
which
she
had
recently
seen
what
idea
of
the
sacredness
of
the
office
of
teacher
and
the
solemnity
of
the
truths
to
be
taught
had
she
the
boys
were
listening
their
heads
bent
forward
all
around
her
what
of
that
they
would
have
listened
equally
well
to
a
story
of
a
fourth
avenue
riot
and
been
equally
benefited
you
think
they
did
not
know
just
when
the
speaker
slipped
from
the
events
of
last
week
to
the
events
of
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
indeed
so
ignorant
were
they
of
all
past
history
that
they
were
not
even
aware
that
she
went
back
into
the
past
for
aught
they
knew
she
might
have
gone
on
wednesday
of
last
week
to
see
the
man
who
could
untie
knots
by
magic
and
on
thursday
to
see
the
men
who
could
drop
canes
on
the
ground
that
would
appear
to
turn
into
wriggling
serpents
but
there
was
one
statement
that
proved
too
much
for
their
credulity
you
could
not
imagine
what
occurred
next
said
the
teacher
the
cane
or
rod
that
the
first
man
had
dropped
actually
opened
its
mouth
and
swallowed
the
other
rods
that
seemed
to
be
serpents
and
was
left
there
alone
in
its
triumph
oh
bosh
said
nimble
dick
contempt
expressed
in
the
very
curve
of
his
nose
that
too
steep
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
these
fellows
can
do
lots
of
queer
things
i
seen
perform
myself
but
they
never
made
a
live
thing
yet
i
heard
folks
that
know
say
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
reach
said
roberts
with
animation
you
are
right
they
never
did
and
you
have
discovered
just
the
difference
between
them
and
the
one
man
of
whom
i
have
been
telling
you
worked
by
the
power
of
god
he
distinctly
stated
that
he
did
and
that
god
really
turned
his
rod
into
a
serpent
and
allowed
it
to
swallow
the
imitations
of
life
and
then
turned
it
back
again
into
a
rod
to
show
that
nothing
was
beyond
his
did
you
see
the
thing
done
questioned
a
young
skeptic
running
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
in
a
skillful
way
and
distorting
his
whole
face
with
a
disagreeable
leer
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
being
cheated
into
listening
to
a
bible
story
roberts
was
prompt
with
her
answer
oh
no
i
did
not
neither
did
i
see
the
great
fire
that
you
had
in
this
city
about
a
year
ago
at
that
time
i
was
a
thousand
miles
away
and
it
so
happens
that
i
have
never
talked
with
any
person
who
did
see
it
yet
i
know
there
was
a
great
fire
and
many
buildings
were
burned
and
lives
lost
it
has
been
proved
to
oh
well
said
skeptic
number
two
while
number
one
retired
into
silence
to
speculate
over
this
answer
fires
are
common
enough
things
anybody
can
know
that
they
happen
but
it
ai
such
a
common
affair
to
see
a
stick
turn
into
a
serpent
and
swallow
up
other
serpents
i
seen
them
fellows
make
things
that
looked
like
snakes
myself
i
could
most
swear
to
it
that
i
seen
them
wriggle
but
they
never
did
no
that
is
they
did
not
give
unmistakable
signs
that
they
were
alive
but
do
you
think
it
too
strange
a
thing
for
god
to
do
surely
he
can
make
life
how
is
it
that
you
are
here
breathing
talking
thinking
if
there
is
no
power
anywhere
to
make
life
oh
i
came
from
a
tadpole
said
the
boastful
young
scientist
putting
his
thumbs
under
his
arms
and
affecting
an
air
of
great
wisdom
i
know
all
about
that
i
was
there
and
see
the
things
evolution
staring
her
in
the
face
in
a
corner
class
in
a
mission
school
a
class
that
had
been
gathered
from
the
slums
roberts
did
not
know
that
these
are
the
very
places
in
which
to
find
it
in
all
its
coarseness
yet
she
made
haste
to
meet
the
boy
on
his
own
ground
very
well
if
you
choose
to
take
that
view
of
it
was
not
the
tadpole
alive
where
did
the
come
from
you
insist
that
the
story
i
have
been
telling
you
is
untrue
because
you
know
that
none
of
these
performers
have
ever
or
ever
make
actual
life
that
it
is
an
impossible
thing
for
human
beings
to
do
yet
when
i
tell
you
that
did
it
you
refuse
the
statement
how
are
you
going
to
account
for
life
if
in
its
very
lowest
forms
it
can
not
be
made
by
men
who
have
given
all
their
time
to
the
study
of
the
marvellous
how
is
it
that
it
is
everywhere
about
us
unless
i
am
correct
and
there
is
a
power
that
can
produce
life
not
a
boy
among
them
had
heard
the
term
evolution
knew
anything
about
the
survival
of
the
they
were
entirely
ignorant
of
protoplasm
or
bioplasm
yet
not
one
of
them
but
had
caught
the
meaning
of
some
of
these
terms
as
they
had
been
translated
for
them
into
the
vernacular
of
the
city
slums
not
one
in
the
class
but
perceived
that
their
champion
arguer
had
been
met
on
his
own
ground
and
vanquished
not
with
an
outburst
of
horror
he
had
not
even
been
informed
that
he
was
irreverent
nimble
dick
delighted
in
making
each
teacher
tell
him
this
he
had
merely
been
replied
to
in
the
calmest
of
argumentative
tones
and
called
upon
to
account
for
the
facts
in
his
own
statements
and
had
been
unable
to
do
so
the
crowd
broke
into
a
derisive
laugh
and
were
noisy
it
is
true
and
brought
troubled
frowns
to
the
face
of
their
superintendent
and
made
the
flush
on
alfred
face
deepen
yet
if
both
these
anxious
watchers
had
known
it
it
was
worthy
of
note
that
the
laugh
had
been
at
the
expense
of
one
of
their
number
and
not
at
their
teacher
well
go
on
interposed
the
youngest
and
quietest
of
the
group
tell
us
some
more
about
your
old
fellow
with
his
serpents
did
they
stay
swallowed
and
what
did
it
all
amount
to
anyhow
thus
challenged
roberts
gave
her
whole
heart
to
the
business
of
giving
in
as
dramatic
a
manner
as
she
could
the
closing
scenes
in
the
act
performed
in
egypt
so
long
ago
carefully
avoiding
any
reference
to
time
and
mentioning
no
names
using
only
modern
terms
and
an
exceedingly
simple
conversational
form
of
language
she
was
however
presently
interrupted
with
a
question
when
did
all
this
happen
and
why
do
somebody
do
something
like
it
nowadays
ignoring
the
first
question
roberts
adroitly
gave
herself
to
the
second
why
do
you
find
your
pleasure
in
tumbling
around
on
the
floor
playing
with
a
marble
or
two
as
you
did
when
a
child
the
world
was
in
its
childhood
when
god
taught
the
people
in
this
way
he
has
given
them
just
as
wonderful
lessons
since
but
lessons
more
suited
to
men
and
women
who
have
learned
to
think
and
reason
we
do
like
to
be
always
treated
as
whether
they
really
dimly
understood
the
meaning
or
not
is
possibly
doubtful
yet
it
appealed
to
their
sense
of
dignity
in
so
indirect
a
way
that
they
did
not
themselves
realize
what
inclined
them
to
quiet
for
a
moment
while
she
finished
her
sentence
earnestly
in
the
midst
of
the
quiet
the
rang
and
the
seven
young
scamps
seemed
at
once
to
take
into
their
hearts
seven
other
spirits
worse
than
themselves
and
behaved
abominably
during
the
closing
exercises
and
tumbled
out
of
the
door
over
each
other
in
the
wildest
fashion
the
moment
the
signal
was
given
halting
only
to
say
in
the
person
of
their
leader
you
be
on
hand
next
sunday
we
like
your
yarns
first
roberts
with
glowing
cheeks
and
eyes
behind
which
there
were
unshed
tears
made
her
way
to
the
desk
where
durant
was
standing
and
spoke
quickly
there
is
a
difference
between
others
who
have
tried
it
and
myself
durant
the
sentence
in
ried
account
that
gave
me
courage
was
one
has
failed
so
far
people
are
unwilling
to
take
the
class
a
second
time
i
have
failed
but
i
want
to
try
chapter
iii
anything
uncommon
about
me
though
they
rushed
out
with
even
more
noise
than
usual
every
boy
of
them
knew
that
the
noise
was
to
cover
a
certain
sense
of
because
they
had
actually
been
beguiled
into
listening
quietly
for
a
few
minutes
to
earnest
words
directly
they
had
reached
the
privacy
of
the
street
they
became
quieter
i
say
boys
said
nimble
dick
is
that
an
awful
green
one
or
a
new
kind
new
i
should
say
replied
one
of
the
younger
boys
she
ai
like
anything
that
been
in
that
room
since
we
got
acquainted
with
it
i
do
know
her
style
what
do
you
take
it
she
meant
by
that
stuff
about
being
friends
and
telling
us
where
she
lived
and
all
that
dunno
what
she
meant
but
she
ai
you
may
bet
your
head
on
that
i
tell
you
what
i
think
boys
i
she
knows
what
she
is
about
every
what
this
sage
conclusion
amounted
to
one
not
acquainted
with
the
dialect
of
the
street
might
have
been
at
a
loss
to
understand
but
the
rest
of
the
party
received
it
in
grave
silence
and
nods
of
the
head
as
though
it
were
a
thought
that
needed
careful
investigation
in
common
parlance
jerry
tompkins
had
expressed
the
opinion
that
roberts
had
some
point
to
gain
in
being
so
uncommonly
polite
and
attentive
to
them
and
they
were
curious
to
know
what
the
motive
could
possibly
be
they
considered
the
important
question
in
silence
until
they
reached
the
next
corner
then
nimble
dick
tossing
back
his
head
as
one
who
had
thrown
off
an
abstruse
problem
and
would
have
none
of
it
said
well
what
next
we
got
through
with
that
fun
for
what
are
you
going
to
do
boys
say
we
go
around
to
poke
and
see
what
is
going
on
there
to
this
proposition
there
was
eager
agreement
from
all
the
party
save
one
he
maintained
a
somewhat
moody
silence
what
say
dirk
the
leader
asked
addressing
him
are
you
ready
for
poke
no
i
do
think
i
go
around
just
what
then
if
you
got
something
better
on
hand
why
do
you
let
a
fellow
know
we
not
dying
for
poke
i
have
got
a
thing
on
hand
only
i
do
care
about
going
where
then
nowhere
mean
place
too
cold
weather
to
stop
in
the
streets
be
a
good
fire
at
poke
you
come
along
do
go
to
getting
the
sulks
it
ai
becoming
just
after
you
been
to
but
the
young
fellow
persisted
in
gloomily
refusing
to
join
them
and
presently
they
began
to
tease
in
what
they
meant
to
be
a
way
dirk
struck
said
one
that
party
has
got
him
by
the
throat
i
saw
her
looking
at
him
most
uncommon
sharp
when
she
was
telling
that
biggest
story
of
hers
about
the
serpent
that
swallowed
dirk
he
thinks
he
been
swallowed
by
one
of
he
feels
it
choking
in
his
no
said
another
that
ai
it
dirk
to
get
pious
his
last
dodge
i
seen
the
spell
coming
on
for
some
time
you
see
him
pick
up
that
there
bible
and
lay
it
on
the
seat
the
other
sunday
after
jerry
elbow
knocked
it
off
by
mistake
i
been
scared
about
dirk
ever
since
and
now
he
wo
go
to
poke
it
a
bad
sign
i
say
dirk
maybe
there
going
to
be
a
down
your
way
and
you
would
mind
letting
us
come
they
expected
him
to
laugh
but
his
face
grew
blacker
than
before
and
at
last
he
said
in
very
significant
tones
you
better
hold
up
there
scrawly
if
you
do
want
to
try
the
depth
of
that
leave
him
be
said
nimble
dick
quickly
he
going
into
one
of
his
tantrums
when
he
begins
like
that
there
no
end
to
the
fighting
that
in
him
and
i
do
want
a
row
now
it
too
early
in
the
day
besides
i
know
something
that
better
fun
you
fellows
come
along
with
me
and
let
him
as
this
was
said
in
a
sort
of
undertone
as
dirk
strode
on
ahead
and
when
at
another
corner
he
dashed
down
it
leaving
them
all
there
was
no
call
after
him
he
was
free
to
go
where
he
would
and
for
reasons
that
he
himself
could
not
have
explained
he
chose
that
it
should
be
home
that
is
the
place
which
he
called
home
it
might
not
meet
your
ideas
of
what
a
spot
so
named
should
be
the
road
to
it
led
through
one
of
the
meanest
portions
of
the
city
each
foot
of
the
way
the
houses
seemed
to
grow
more
squalid
looking
and
the
streets
filthier
the
particular
alley
down
which
he
dived
at
last
was
narrower
and
blacker
than
any
yet
passed
and
the
cellar
door
which
he
pushed
open
let
him
into
the
house
in
the
row
a
long
low
dark
room
in
one
corner
there
was
the
remnant
of
a
stove
braced
up
by
bricks
and
stones
but
no
fire
was
burning
therein
though
the
day
was
cold
furniture
there
was
none
unless
the
usual
rickety
table
and
two
broken
chairs
could
be
called
by
that
name
a
door
was
ajar
that
led
into
an
inner
cellar
and
a
glimpse
of
piles
of
offensive
looking
rags
that
were
called
by
the
family
might
have
given
you
an
idea
of
what
their
home
life
was
as
hardly
any
other
phase
of
it
can
the
rags
were
not
all
in
the
further
cellar
however
a
gay
quilt
or
at
least
one
that
had
once
been
gay
but
from
which
bits
of
black
cotton
now
oozed
in
every
direction
seemed
to
have
curled
itself
in
a
heap
against
the
one
window
however
it
moved
soon
after
dirk
opened
the
door
and
showed
itself
to
be
more
than
a
quilt
inside
was
a
young
girl
the
quilt
wrapped
around
her
closely
drawn
up
about
her
face
and
head
as
if
she
would
hide
all
but
her
eyes
within
and
try
to
get
rid
of
shivering
you
home
she
said
her
tones
expressing
surprise
but
at
the
same
time
indifference
what
is
it
for
because
i
wanted
to
come
has
a
fellow
a
right
to
come
home
if
he
wants
to
of
course
and
it
such
a
lovely
home
and
you
are
so
fond
of
it
no
one
need
wonder
at
your
coming
in
the
middle
of
the
the
sentence
was
sarcastic
enough
but
the
tones
were
hardly
so
they
expressed
too
much
indifference
even
for
sarcasm
dirk
surveyed
her
thoughtfully
he
seemed
to
have
no
answer
ready
in
fact
his
face
wore
almost
a
startled
air
and
really
the
thought
which
presented
itself
for
consideration
was
startling
something
about
the
face
of
the
girl
done
up
so
grotesquely
in
her
ragged
quilt
suggested
the
lady
who
had
been
his
teacher
at
the
mission
could
one
find
a
sharper
contrast
than
existed
between
these
two
yet
dirk
as
he
looked
could
not
get
away
from
it
what
are
you
staring
at
the
girl
asked
presently
growing
uneasy
over
the
fixedness
of
his
gaze
do
you
see
anything
uncommon
about
me
where
mother
he
asked
dropping
his
eyes
and
turning
from
her
in
there
asleep
you
need
talk
quite
so
loud
it
wo
hurt
her
to
get
a
bit
of
rest
she
sat
up
till
morning
poking
at
your
old
dirk
looked
down
at
it
thoughtfully
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
make
it
decent
although
the
setting
of
the
patches
showed
an
unpractised
hand
and
they
were
of
a
strikingly
different
color
from
the
coat
itself
you
might
have
done
it
for
her
then
in
the
daytime
he
said
briefly
and
added
where
father
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
should
i
know
where
he
is
most
of
the
time
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
or
ought
to
you
live
on
the
he
gave
her
an
answer
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
i
say
mart
what
is
the
use
in
being
so
horrid
cross
all
the
time
you
are
so
she
said
and
everything
is
so
nice
and
pleasant
around
me
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
should
ever
be
cross
that
all
lost
mart
for
i
never
said
i
was
nor
thought
i
was
and
if
i
do
know
just
how
hateful
things
are
i
should
like
to
know
who
does
but
after
all
what
good
does
it
do
to
snarl
why
could
you
and
me
say
a
word
once
in
a
while
just
for
a
change
try
it
she
said
i
wish
you
would
i
so
tired
of
things
as
they
now
are
that
most
any
change
would
be
fine
but
i
risk
your
doing
much
in
that
line
it
is
in
what
was
there
in
this
cross
girl
to
remind
any
one
in
his
senses
of
evan
roberts
yet
even
as
she
spoke
that
last
ungracious
sentence
she
turned
a
little
so
that
a
slant
beam
of
sunshine
one
of
the
few
that
ever
found
its
way
into
this
dreary
room
laid
a
streak
of
light
just
across
her
hair
yellowing
it
until
it
was
almost
the
shade
that
he
had
noted
in
the
lady
at
the
mission
and
he
thought
of
her
again
and
wondered
curiously
whether
if
mart
were
dressed
in
the
shining
black
dress
and
fur
wraps
and
bonnet
that
the
lady
had
worn
she
would
really
resemble
her
how
would
mart
look
dressed
up
he
wondered
even
decently
dressed
as
the
girls
were
whom
he
met
on
the
streets
he
had
never
seen
her
in
anything
much
more
becoming
than
the
ragged
quilt
he
was
studying
her
in
a
way
that
mart
did
not
in
the
least
understand
she
broke
the
spell
suddenly
again
have
you
had
any
dinner
dinner
why
no
of
course
not
where
would
i
find
that
sort
of
thing
i
looked
all
up
and
down
the
streets
and
smelled
plenty
of
it
but
not
a
bite
did
i
where
have
you
been
oh
around
in
several
places
not
much
of
i
know
where
you
been
a
severe
light
coming
into
her
eyes
you
been
down
to
the
south
end
and
if
i
was
you
i
be
ashamed
of
myself
i
know
how
you
fellows
go
on
down
there
sallie
calkins
goes
and
she
told
me
all
about
it
she
said
that
she
was
ashamed
to
live
on
the
same
street
with
any
of
you
and
that
none
of
the
folks
in
the
mission
knew
what
to
do
with
you
and
the
next
thing
you
knew
you
would
all
be
marched
off
to
the
let
them
try
it
muttered
dirk
his
face
growing
darker
we
make
that
street
too
hot
to
hold
them
in
short
order
if
they
played
at
any
such
game
as
that
and
i
guess
they
know
well
anyhow
i
would
be
meaner
and
lower
down
than
i
had
to
be
dirk
colson
it
is
bad
enough
as
it
is
a
drunkard
for
a
father
and
we
nothing
more
than
beggars
but
i
behave
myself
decent
when
i
went
among
folks
that
wanted
to
be
good
to
me
or
else
i
stay
look
here
you
keep
your
preaching
for
them
that
wants
to
hear
it
i
do
a
fellow
ca
come
home
without
having
a
row
if
it
is
of
one
kind
it
another
i
wonder
i
ever
come
home
at
dirk
was
angry
now
and
his
dark
thin
face
looked
fierce
with
passion
his
sister
kept
the
curiously
composed
tone
and
manner
with
which
she
had
said
all
her
exasperating
things
i
wonder
you
do
she
said
i
suppose
you
get
starved
and
ca
help
it
now
and
then
there
some
dinner
i
saved
for
you
if
you
want
it
eat
it
and
then
take
yourself
to
some
place
that
suits
you
as
she
spoke
she
jerked
open
the
door
of
a
little
cupboard
near
which
she
stood
and
brought
therefrom
a
plate
on
which
lay
a
baked
potato
with
one
end
broken
or
bitten
off
then
carefully
replaced
as
if
the
owner
might
have
had
a
second
thought
as
to
its
disposal
there
was
also
a
bit
of
somewhat
burned
and
half
of
a
roasted
apple
meagre
as
the
fare
was
for
a
hungry
boy
there
was
more
variety
than
he
had
expected
and
something
in
the
simple
preparation
touched
him
and
quieted
his
anger
where
did
this
come
from
he
asked
taking
in
the
unaccustomed
morsel
of
apple
with
two
eager
bites
i
tell
you
that
is
good
sally
calkins
gave
it
to
me
last
night
she
got
one
give
to
her
just
as
the
last
bite
was
gone
it
occurred
to
dirk
first
to
wonder
and
then
to
be
almost
certain
that
his
sister
having
shared
the
apple
had
saved
her
entire
share
for
him
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
known
of
such
an
effort
on
her
part
to
supply
him
with
food
had
he
thought
of
it
sooner
he
would
certainly
have
left
a
bit
of
the
dainty
for
her
but
no
thought
of
telling
her
so
for
an
instant
crossed
his
mind
neither
had
she
on
her
part
the
slightest
idea
of
describing
to
him
with
what
care
and
patience
she
and
sallie
had
roasted
the
choice
morsel
before
sallie
fire
only
last
night
sallie
father
being
fortunately
late
in
coming
and
so
giving
them
a
chance
then
she
had
borne
hers
home
in
a
bit
of
paper
and
carefully
guarded
it
all
day
just
for
this
hour
also
she
might
have
told
him
that
she
bit
the
end
from
the
potato
before
she
remembered
that
there
would
be
none
left
for
him
and
then
fitted
it
on
again
as
best
she
could
and
went
without
she
would
not
have
told
him
for
worlds
why
she
could
not
have
explained
why
something
within
her
shrank
from
letting
him
know
not
that
she
sacrificed
for
him
but
that
she
enough
for
him
to
want
to
do
it
potato
and
were
gone
to
the
last
crumb
it
seemed
to
dirk
that
there
had
been
only
enough
of
them
to
show
him
how
hungry
he
was
i
suppose
there
is
anything
more
he
said
wistfully
with
the
rising
inflection
indeed
but
not
as
one
who
had
any
idea
of
receiving
an
affirmative
answer
i
should
think
there
was
defiance
in
the
tone
there
a
piece
of
bread
that
i
kept
for
mother
supper
and
i
mean
she
shall
have
well
do
bite
me
i
perfectly
willing
that
she
shall
is
there
anything
for
a
fire
only
some
chips
that
i
saving
till
mother
has
her
nap
you
better
go
to
bed
yourself
then
it
awful
cold
i
ai
going
to
stir
from
this
corner
so
long
as
this
streak
of
light
lasts
it
is
so
very
often
i
see
it
that
i
can
afford
to
lose
her
brother
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
had
gathered
the
folds
of
the
ragged
quilt
about
her
again
and
was
crouching
at
the
low
window
and
the
very
last
gleam
that
the
sunshine
would
vouchsafe
them
came
and
glimmered
in
her
hair
there
it
was
again
that
mysterious
haunting
resemblance
what
would
mart
think
if
he
told
her
of
it
probably
that
he
was
trying
to
poke
fun
at
her
at
least
he
should
not
experiment
yet
he
could
not
help
wondering
again
how
mart
would
look
if
she
were
dressed
like
other
people
i
say
mart
he
began
suddenly
breaking
the
stillness
let
you
and
i
get
out
of
this
where
it
is
warmer
come
and
take
a
walk
down
on
the
avenue
the
sun
will
shine
yet
for
half
an
hour
and
it
is
real
warm
and
in
this
quilt
she
asked
significantly
looking
down
at
it
the
boy
face
darkened
has
your
shawl
got
out
of
pawn
yet
how
should
it
he
flung
himself
angrily
out
of
the
broken
chair
picked
up
his
ragged
cap
and
strode
angrily
and
noisily
across
the
room
out
at
the
door
stumbling
up
the
steps
like
one
with
disgust
or
rage
and
went
on
swift
feet
down
the
street
out
of
sight
and
mart
poor
mart
left
thus
to
solitude
let
the
last
beam
of
the
sun
go
without
watching
and
buried
her
face
in
the
ragged
quilt
and
cried
chapter
iv
i
do
blame
it
was
not
a
pet
name
poor
mart
colson
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
with
a
pet
name
her
life
had
not
taught
her
how
to
use
such
phrases
how
she
came
to
be
named
martha
she
did
not
know
but
a
woman
could
have
told
her
of
a
country
home
long
ago
where
there
were
daffodils
blowing
in
the
early
spring
almost
under
the
snow
where
later
the
earth
was
turned
into
sky
or
the
stars
came
down
and
gleamed
all
over
her
father
fields
so
plentiful
were
the
dandelions
and
the
breath
of
the
clover
came
in
at
all
the
open
windows
and
the
cows
her
father
cows
coming
home
from
pasture
and
the
tinkle
of
their
bells
were
sights
and
sounds
familiar
to
her
ear
she
sat
there
one
summer
evening
in
the
watching
the
glory
and
the
peace
and
studying
between
times
her
sabbath
lesson
often
and
often
the
words
came
back
to
her
in
future
years
now
jesus
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
that
was
one
of
the
verses
was
it
a
dim
memory
of
the
words
and
a
sort
of
blind
reaching
out
after
their
fulfilment
that
led
her
to
name
her
poor
little
baby
martha
the
old
home
had
vanished
the
meadows
the
tinkling
bells
the
peace
and
the
plenty
were
as
utterly
things
of
the
past
as
though
they
had
not
been
mother
and
father
and
one
brother
were
gone
lying
in
neglected
graves
and
she
why
the
baby
father
was
and
had
been
for
three
weeks
a
hard
word
coarse
almost
why
do
i
say
intoxicated
oh
because
i
ca
i
no
desire
to
find
words
with
which
to
cover
the
sin
of
that
baby
father
but
the
mother
named
her
martha
she
never
told
her
why
if
indeed
she
herself
fully
knew
it
was
not
a
family
name
gradually
after
the
fashion
of
the
times
she
sought
to
shorten
the
name
and
because
they
had
not
sweet
short
words
as
pet
and
dear
and
sweet
all
such
belong
to
happy
homes
they
grew
to
calling
her
mart
and
now
even
she
herself
hardly
realized
that
she
had
ever
owned
to
any
other
call
poor
mart
i
find
myself
wanting
to
use
the
adjective
over
and
over
again
when
i
speak
of
her
such
a
desolate
loveless
life
always
a
drunken
father
she
had
never
known
any
other
always
a
disheartened
mother
who
shut
her
tenderness
for
the
child
within
herself
as
one
who
could
not
afford
to
show
it
then
dirk
the
one
brother
going
astray
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
born
what
wonder
from
such
a
home
yet
mart
wondered
and
felt
bitter
over
it
why
could
not
dirk
be
like
some
others
of
whom
she
knew
like
sallie
calkin
brother
for
instance
who
worked
day
and
night
and
brought
home
often
and
often
an
apple
or
a
herring
or
sometimes
even
a
picture
paper
for
sallie
mart
was
all
her
life
had
taught
her
to
be
so
she
spoke
sharp
words
out
of
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
at
dirk
and
of
late
rarely
anything
but
sharp
words
yet
and
this
was
mart
secret
hidden
away
as
if
it
were
something
of
which
to
be
ashamed
she
dirk
loved
him
fiercely
with
all
the
wealth
of
her
young
heart
and
often
she
loved
him
she
was
harsh
and
bitter
towards
him
though
she
did
not
herself
understand
why
this
should
be
as
for
dirk
he
walked
rapidly
but
for
a
few
blocks
his
dinner
had
been
too
insufficient
to
give
him
strength
after
the
first
aimless
anger
had
subsided
then
came
the
question
what
to
do
with
himself
why
had
he
gone
with
the
fellows
more
than
likely
some
of
them
had
contrived
a
way
to
get
a
dinner
why
had
he
persisted
in
sullenly
leaving
them
all
and
going
home
he
had
not
the
least
idea
why
he
had
been
impelled
to
go
home
now
that
he
was
fairly
away
from
home
again
he
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
himself
a
place
where
he
could
warm
his
feet
and
his
hands
where
he
could
get
a
bite
to
eat
possibly
this
last
would
be
an
immense
attraction
but
was
not
a
necessity
and
he
did
not
expect
it
but
warmth
at
least
he
felt
that
he
must
have
where
would
he
find
it
what
place
had
been
provided
for
such
as
he
he
ought
by
this
time
to
have
been
earning
his
own
living
to
have
had
a
corner
which
he
could
call
home
earned
by
himself
where
some
of
the
decencies
of
life
were
gathered
of
course
he
ought
but
the
painful
fact
to
meet
just
now
was
that
he
had
not
done
his
duty
he
had
gone
astray
not
so
far
but
that
there
were
plenty
of
chances
to
go
farther
greater
deeps
to
which
he
might
yet
reach
but
far
enough
to
all
but
break
any
watchful
heart
only
that
mother
heart
was
broken
before
he
was
born
the
simple
question
waiting
to
be
solved
was
this
having
done
as
poorly
for
himself
as
under
the
circumstances
he
well
could
what
was
dirk
colson
to
do
next
he
had
no
idea
neither
apparently
had
multitudes
of
christian
people
engaged
in
praying
that
the
father
will
might
be
done
on
earth
even
as
it
was
in
heaven
the
young
man
walked
six
blocks
down
the
respectable
avenue
lined
with
pleasant
homes
where
the
people
went
to
church
and
read
their
bibles
and
had
family
prayers
and
kept
holy
the
sabbath
day
not
a
door
among
them
all
opened
and
held
out
a
winning
signal
to
arrest
his
heedless
feet
not
so
satan
is
he
ever
caught
idling
at
his
post
just
around
the
corner
from
the
respectable
avenue
and
around
the
corner
dirk
presently
turned
still
uncertain
what
to
do
where
to
find
the
warmth
he
craved
then
the
winning
invitations
for
such
as
he
began
to
present
themselves
saloons
and
saloons
and
saloons
how
many
of
them
were
there
far
outnumbering
the
churches
pleasant
they
looked
too
opening
doors
ever
and
anon
revealing
brightness
and
warmth
within
they
would
like
to
see
him
inside
of
this
dirk
was
sure
not
that
he
had
money
but
he
had
something
that
in
such
places
often
served
him
well
a
decided
and
dangerous
talent
for
imitating
any
and
every
peculiarity
of
voice
or
manner
that
had
chanced
to
come
under
his
notice
he
could
make
the
fellows
in
these
saloons
roar
with
laughter
if
he
did
particularly
well
they
were
willing
to
order
for
him
a
glass
of
beer
or
a
fairly
good
cigar
in
any
case
he
had
a
chance
to
get
warm
this
was
actually
dirk
only
present
source
of
income
yet
he
shrank
from
it
he
could
not
have
told
you
why
but
on
this
particular
sabbath
he
was
averse
to
earning
his
coveted
warmth
in
this
way
he
walked
resolutely
by
two
or
three
places
where
he
had
reason
to
think
he
might
be
welcomed
wondering
vaguely
whether
there
was
something
else
a
fellow
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
freezing
oddly
enough
there
seemed
to
be
something
about
the
glimmer
of
sunshine
as
he
saw
it
in
mart
hair
that
kept
him
from
halting
before
any
of
the
places
open
to
him
what
if
she
had
come
out
with
him
to
take
a
walk
he
could
not
have
taken
her
into
one
of
them
then
poor
fellow
he
set
himself
to
wondering
where
the
place
was
open
and
warmed
to
which
he
could
take
mart
there
were
places
several
of
them
in
the
large
city
but
dirk
knew
nothing
about
them
and
he
was
acquainted
with
the
saloons
he
thought
of
another
thing
he
had
been
invited
to
call
at
a
house
on
east
street
suppose
he
should
walk
up
there
this
very
afternoon
and
ring
the
bell
and
say
that
he
had
come
to
call
what
would
happen
then
whereupon
he
laughed
aloud
the
fancy
seemed
to
him
so
utterly
preposterous
the
idea
of
making
a
call
the
utter
improbability
of
his
ever
seeing
the
inside
of
one
of
the
east
street
mansions
still
remained
that
hopeless
question
what
should
he
do
with
himself
the
sun
was
quite
gone
now
and
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
up
freshly
from
the
north
it
blew
directly
through
dirk
threadbare
garments
he
turned
suddenly
and
slipped
inside
one
of
the
worst
of
the
many
saloons
which
literally
lined
this
end
of
the
street
he
had
refused
to
go
with
the
boys
to
poke
an
hour
or
two
before
and
this
was
several
grades
below
poke
in
decency
but
it
was
growing
dark
and
he
was
cold
there
was
one
young
man
who
saw
him
dash
down
those
cellar
stairs
who
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
his
face
darkening
the
while
with
discouragement
this
then
was
all
the
afternoon
had
accomplished
for
him
to
be
sure
he
was
not
disappointed
at
the
result
it
was
no
more
than
he
had
expected
but
it
was
so
discouraging
to
be
an
to
the
degradation
to
which
these
young
wretches
had
fallen
of
course
the
young
man
was
alfred
ried
and
he
went
home
and
was
dreary
over
all
sorts
of
failures
in
christian
work
mission
especially
and
their
own
more
especially
than
any
other
among
the
early
shoppers
on
monday
morning
came
evan
roberts
shopping
however
seemed
to
be
a
small
part
of
her
business
she
came
directly
to
young
ried
counter
and
addressed
him
very
much
as
though
she
had
ceased
talking
with
him
but
a
moment
before
mr
ried
what
can
you
and
i
do
for
those
boys
during
the
week
but
alfred
was
at
his
gloomiest
i
do
see
that
we
can
do
anything
for
them
at
any
time
he
said
dismally
what
is
an
hour
on
sunday
set
against
all
the
rest
of
the
time
they
go
from
the
to
the
rum
saloons
and
dawdle
away
the
rest
of
the
day
yesterday
i
met
that
young
colson
going
into
one
of
the
worst
saloons
on
dey
street
they
are
not
to
blame
this
last
in
a
fiercer
tone
after
a
slight
pause
i
do
blame
them
they
have
nowhere
else
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
and
it
is
cold
on
the
streets
and
warm
in
the
if
he
expected
the
small
lady
who
was
regarding
him
so
steadily
to
take
the
other
side
of
this
question
he
was
disappointed
she
spoke
quietly
enough
but
with
the
earnestness
of
conviction
those
are
startling
facts
i
do
not
see
how
one
could
be
surprised
that
the
results
are
they
are
and
the
practical
question
forces
itself
upon
us
what
are
we
to
do
under
the
circumstances
ried
you
have
had
your
eyes
open
in
regard
to
this
subject
for
some
time
what
have
you
thought
out
now
was
alfred
ried
embarrassed
it
was
true
that
his
eyes
had
been
long
open
to
the
subject
it
was
true
that
he
had
given
it
a
great
deal
of
what
he
had
called
thought
but
with
those
alert
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
her
whole
manner
indicating
intense
earnestness
he
suddenly
realized
that
all
his
thought
had
been
to
no
purpose
had
accomplished
nothing
unless
it
had
served
to
give
him
a
feeling
almost
of
irritation
against
the
boys
and
their
teachers
who
made
failures
and
the
people
who
folded
their
hands
and
let
things
go
to
ruin
here
confronted
him
one
whose
hands
were
not
folded
though
they
rested
quietly
enough
on
the
counter
before
him
he
began
to
feel
that
there
might
be
latent
power
in
them
i
have
nothing
to
say
and
he
said
it
at
last
with
flushed
face
and
embarrassed
voice
i
have
thought
out
nothing
the
whole
thing
seemed
hopeless
to
me
with
my
utter
lack
of
resources
my
sister
had
schemes
many
of
them
and
they
seemed
to
me
good
ones
even
then
they
seem
better
now
only
i
can
not
carry
them
she
caught
at
the
name
your
sister
ester
ried
good
let
us
carry
them
out
you
and
i
and
as
many
more
as
we
can
get
to
help
us
she
is
at
work
yet
do
you
see
what
is
that
prophecy
about
her
that
voice
which
the
prophet
heard
you
know
i
heard
a
voice
saying
unto
me
write
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
how
strangely
the
words
sounded
repeated
in
her
low
clear
voice
amid
the
hum
of
business
on
every
side
alfred
ried
felt
singularly
moved
he
had
been
a
highly
strung
imaginative
child
he
had
been
his
sister
ester
almost
constant
companion
during
those
last
months
in
which
she
was
slowly
fading
out
of
sight
while
julia
held
steadily
to
her
mother
side
and
learned
to
do
many
helpful
things
he
had
been
stationed
chief
nurse
in
ester
room
to
see
that
she
lacked
for
no
tender
care
during
the
hours
when
others
must
be
away
from
her
and
those
hours
she
had
tenderly
improved
he
remembered
to
this
day
just
how
she
looked
with
a
pink
flush
all
over
her
cheeks
and
a
bright
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
talked
to
him
of
the
things
that
she
and
douglass
had
meant
to
do
for
boys
neglected
homeless
friendless
boys
oh
the
plans
they
had
carefully
thought
out
to
reach
after
these
forsaken
ones
he
remembered
that
his
own
cheeks
had
grown
hot
while
he
listened
and
the
blood
had
seemed
to
race
like
fire
through
his
veins
when
she
said
god
wants
for
something
else
alfred
but
you
will
do
my
work
when
you
get
to
be
a
man
you
will
find
helpers
and
carry
it
on
as
i
wanted
to
he
had
made
no
audible
answer
but
he
had
told
himself
sturdily
again
and
again
that
he
certainly
would
yet
here
he
was
barely
of
age
and
almost
soured
by
disappointments
certain
attempts
having
proved
failures
and
having
not
found
the
helpers
whom
he
had
eagerly
expected
the
magnitude
of
the
work
impressed
itself
upon
him
more
remorselessly
each
hour
yet
now
he
seemed
to
feel
again
the
thrill
in
his
veins
and
he
felt
almost
under
the
power
of
his
sister
eye
while
those
words
were
in
his
ears
they
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
might
it
possibly
be
that
this
was
one
of
the
helpers
of
whom
ester
used
to
talk
sent
by
god
himself
to
take
up
her
planned
work
and
follow
it
out
yet
she
was
so
utterly
unlike
his
memory
of
ester
she
had
seemed
to
him
a
woman
roberts
was
so
small
and
and
so
fashionably
dressed
and
how
those
boys
had
acted
with
her
only
yesterday
what
could
she
possibly
do
customers
came
just
then
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
they
wanted
round
collars
and
deep
collars
and
fichus
and
edges
and
a
hundred
little
irritating
things
young
ried
usually
so
gracious
and
patient
had
much
ado
to
keep
from
showing
his
annoyance
over
the
smallness
of
all
their
wishes
meantime
roberts
who
had
taken
a
seat
entered
apparently
with
absorption
into
the
relative
merits
of
round
or
pointed
collars
with
a
young
lady
acquaintance
she
patiently
measured
to
discover
whether
the
corner
of
one
was
a
quarter
of
an
inch
deeper
than
the
other
or
not
she
gave
with
due
deliberation
her
opinion
as
to
whether
the
points
were
more
becoming
to
the
young
lady
style
of
beauty
than
the
rolling
fronts
and
even
went
to
the
trouble
of
unfastening
her
furs
to
show
still
another
style
that
she
liked
better
than
either
sending
the
disgusted
alfred
to
an
entirely
different
box
in
search
of
a
like
pattern
as
he
went
his
lip
curled
visibly
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
allow
himself
to
get
momentarily
excited
over
this
doll
how
preposterous
in
him
to
mention
his
dead
sister
name
to
her
she
had
already
forgotten
the
entire
matter
and
was
deep
in
the
merits
of
collars
his
first
estimate
of
her
had
been
the
correct
one
her
mind
was
just
about
as
deep
he
believed
as
the
tiny
collar
she
was
measuring
what
a
farce
it
was
to
talk
to
her
about
helping
those
poor
fellows
she
probably
thought
a
few
soup
tickets
and
a
chance
for
a
good
christmas
dinner
at
some
of
the
public
charity
halls
was
the
way
to
reach
and
reform
them
should
help
her
she
must
expect
it
doubtless
she
did
not
probably
she
had
by
this
time
forgotten
that
she
had
suggested
it
why
need
she
putter
here
about
a
few
collars
for
a
young
lady
in
her
own
circle
to
wear
with
her
morning
dresses
that
was
just
it
he
told
himself
it
was
because
she
in
her
circle
and
because
the
collars
were
to
be
honored
by
being
worn
by
such
as
she
that
they
became
important
and
the
boys
and
their
desperate
needs
sunk
into
insignificance
well
he
wished
they
would
both
go
and
leave
him
to
himself
give
him
a
chance
to
rally
from
his
momentary
excitement
of
which
he
was
now
ashamed
at
last
the
collars
were
bought
but
not
until
the
counter
was
strewn
with
different
sorts
and
the
lady
with
many
bright
little
nothings
for
last
words
moved
off
to
another
part
of
the
store
and
roberts
whirled
on
her
seat
until
her
eyes
were
in
full
view
again
and
said
what
were
some
of
her
plans
ried
chapter
a
christian
i
do
suppose
you
can
go
into
detail
just
now
she
added
noting
young
ried
hesitation
and
embarrassment
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
give
me
some
general
idea
of
what
she
wanted
to
do
or
thought
could
be
there
were
a
great
many
things
that
she
wanted
to
do
and
i
believe
she
thought
they
could
be
done
but
i
do
think
she
knew
the
world
very
well
said
this
aged
cynic
she
judged
everybody
from
the
standpoint
of
her
own
unselfishness
i
remember
she
was
not
in
sympathy
with
and
and
great
public
charities
of
that
sort
or
i
do
know
that
i
should
say
she
was
not
in
sympathy
with
them
i
mean
rather
that
those
would
not
have
been
her
ways
of
working
she
was
thinking
of
young
people
and
to
give
them
a
dinner
now
and
then
she
would
not
have
considered
a
very
great
step
toward
elevating
them
morally
and
spiritually
roberts
it
was
just
that
which
she
wanted
to
do
lift
them
up
she
thought
there
could
be
invented
ways
of
reaching
them
so
that
they
would
want
helping
want
teaching
it
i
mean
and
she
thought
that
christian
homes
of
wealth
and
culture
could
be
opened
to
them
and
they
gradually
toled
in
made
to
feel
on
a
level
with
others
in
the
social
scale
in
short
she
believed
that
instead
of
people
going
down
to
them
in
a
condescending
spirit
they
could
be
drawn
up
to
the
level
of
others
so
that
they
would
realize
their
manhood
and
be
led
to
make
earnest
efforts
to
take
their
rightful
places
in
the
world
i
know
i
am
bungling
dreadfully
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
her
plans
only
that
they
were
splendid
but
i
am
afraid
the
world
will
have
to
be
made
over
before
they
can
be
carried
perhaps
so
christ
is
at
work
making
the
world
over
you
the
lady
before
him
whose
eyes
never
for
an
instant
moved
from
his
face
spoke
with
exceeding
sweetness
and
gravity
neither
by
word
nor
glance
did
she
give
him
to
understand
that
she
thought
his
schemes
wild
but
i
find
that
after
all
i
want
details
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
grandness
of
your
sister
meaning
what
were
some
of
the
steps
the
little
steps
such
as
you
and
i
could
take
toward
accomplishing
yet
even
while
i
ask
the
question
i
see
something
of
what
the
answer
must
be
homes
opening
to
receive
them
that
is
a
new
thought
to
me
and
in
the
plural
number
i
do
not
see
how
just
now
it
could
be
done
but
christian
home
i
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
that
ried
that
is
the
way
to
begin
it
you
may
depend
indeed
i
suppose
you
have
tried
it
the
city
is
full
of
boys
and
many
of
them
are
away
down
since
we
can
not
reach
all
of
them
this
week
we
must
try
to
reach
seven
and
failing
in
that
suppose
we
say
one
for
which
one
have
you
been
working
just
who
at
this
moment
specially
interests
you
i
hope
it
is
one
of
my
boys
because
you
see
they
appeal
to
me
just
now
as
no
others
can
which
is
it
ried
and
what
have
you
tried
to
do
for
him
and
to
what
extent
have
you
succeeded
there
were
never
any
hotter
cheeks
than
young
ried
just
at
that
moment
this
was
the
most
extraordinary
person
with
whom
he
had
ever
talked
it
was
impossible
to
generalize
with
her
not
that
he
wanted
to
generalize
on
the
contrary
he
at
once
saw
the
possibilities
growing
out
of
individual
effort
and
caught
at
the
idea
of
undertaking
something
but
the
question
was
why
had
he
not
thought
of
it
before
one
person
to
reach
after
and
try
for
surely
he
might
have
attempted
it
instead
of
trying
to
carry
the
hundreds
that
he
stumbled
against
and
so
accomplish
nothing
for
any
of
them
it
was
humiliating
the
confession
that
he
had
to
make
indeed
roberts
i
have
not
one
in
mind
if
you
asked
me
what
one
hundred
i
was
most
anxious
about
i
might
possibly
be
able
to
answer
but
i
see
that
there
has
been
no
individuality
about
it
unless
perhaps
the
or
more
boys
who
compose
that
class
are
taking
a
little
stronger
hold
on
me
than
any
of
the
others
but
even
for
them
i
have
tried
to
do
nothing
unless
two
or
three
attempts
to
secure
a
permanent
teacher
for
them
which
have
ended
in
failure
may
count
for
effort
i
do
blame
myself
as
much
as
i
might
because
now
that
you
suggest
personal
work
to
me
i
realize
that
there
is
nothing
for
one
situated
as
i
am
to
do
i
have
no
christian
home
at
my
ah
but
we
are
to
come
down
to
very
small
numbers
you
know
to
fractions
if
need
be
you
have
a
piece
of
christian
home
at
command
i
trust
but
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
and
she
explained
why
you
have
the
privacy
of
your
own
room
which
is
of
course
your
corner
of
home
just
now
and
it
is
a
christian
corner
is
there
not
room
in
it
sometimes
for
two
he
smiled
faintly
over
that
mrs
roberts
there
is
one
thing
with
which
you
evidently
are
not
familiar
and
that
is
the
corner
which
a
poor
clerk
in
the
city
has
to
call
home
mine
is
the
fourth
story
back
of
a
where
the
thermometer
drops
often
below
the
and
this
place
i
share
with
as
uncongenial
a
fellow
as
ever
breathed
what
would
you
think
of
labelling
such
accommodations
and
what
can
i
do
in
it
for
others
not
much
perhaps
smiling
unless
for
the
uncongenial
fellow
i
should
think
there
might
be
a
chance
in
this
ah
but
he
said
eagerly
he
is
a
christian
my
sympathies
do
not
need
to
be
drawn
out
in
that
the
smile
was
a
peculiar
one
now
but
the
tone
was
very
quiet
in
which
the
little
lady
said
that
some
time
when
they
had
leisure
to
talk
she
should
like
to
ask
him
whether
his
experience
with
christians
had
been
so
exceptionally
bright
that
he
thought
there
was
no
work
to
do
in
that
direction
but
just
now
she
added
earnestly
i
want
to
know
since
you
are
shut
away
from
home
effort
for
which
of
these
boys
you
are
praying
especially
and
which
of
them
do
you
carry
about
on
your
heart
with
the
hope
of
a
chance
meeting
an
unexpected
opportunity
to
speak
a
word
or
do
a
kindness
or
look
a
kindness
that
shall
give
you
possible
future
influence
do
you
have
to
work
in
those
ways
two
people
never
equally
interest
me
at
the
same
moment
i
find
i
must
be
intensely
individual
not
to
the
exclusion
of
others
but
in
praying
for
instance
yesterday
i
prayed
and
this
morning
i
prayed
for
my
entire
class
but
there
was
one
all
the
time
who
was
uppermost
i
find
myself
questioning
what
can
i
do
for
them
all
but
especially
for
him
do
you
know
i
fancy
that
most
christians
feel
the
same
individual
effort
is
so
necessary
that
i
have
thought
perhaps
the
holy
spirit
turns
our
thoughts
most
directly
toward
one
person
at
a
time
so
that
we
may
concentrate
our
efforts
do
you
think
this
is
so
young
ried
did
not
answer
promptly
he
had
no
answer
ready
that
suited
him
his
strongest
feeling
just
then
was
one
of
mingled
with
humiliation
how
had
he
looked
down
on
this
fair
and
beautiful
little
woman
her
very
beauty
being
he
had
fancied
an
element
against
her
when
it
came
to
actual
effort
how
had
he
allowed
himself
to
sneer
over
her
attempts
at
teaching
that
class
of
boys
how
actually
irritable
he
had
been
over
it
how
almost
angrily
he
had
questioned
why
it
was
that
a
teacher
was
not
found
for
them
fitted
to
their
needs
when
he
had
prayed
about
it
so
much
determined
not
to
believe
that
the
prayer
had
been
answered
and
the
teacher
found
yet
here
she
was
the
one
whose
efforts
he
had
despised
talking
already
about
individual
prayer
for
them
while
he
who
had
done
a
great
amount
of
fretting
for
them
had
not
once
presented
them
as
individuals
to
christ
and
asked
a
definite
blessing
for
each
his
answer
when
it
came
was
low
and
full
of
feeling
i
have
concentrated
my
desires
in
praying
for
the
coming
of
such
a
teacher
as
might
get
hold
of
them
and
i
begin
to
think
that
i
have
an
answer
to
my
but
she
was
absolutely
proof
against
compliments
she
wasted
not
a
moment
thought
on
that
but
said
mr
ried
who
are
they
i
tried
to
get
their
names
yesterday
but
soon
saw
that
they
were
not
in
the
mood
to
help
me
i
do
think
i
have
one
correct
name
can
you
give
me
a
list
no
he
could
not
which
admission
did
not
lessen
the
glow
on
his
cheek
possibly
he
could
mention
the
names
of
two
and
guess
at
a
third
but
of
the
others
he
knew
nothing
to
whom
then
can
i
go
durant
would
know
of
course
where
shall
i
find
him
so
much
alfred
knew
durant
was
to
be
found
at
the
fourth
national
bank
but
as
for
giving
information
in
regard
to
that
class
he
was
sure
it
was
beyond
him
he
alfred
had
asked
only
last
sabbath
who
the
boy
was
who
behaved
so
wretchedly
and
also
who
was
the
fellow
next
him
but
durant
had
not
known
well
then
roberts
said
nothing
daunted
not
even
a
shadow
appearing
on
her
quiet
face
she
must
just
study
it
out
with
his
help
there
is
immediate
work
for
you
she
said
for
of
course
i
want
to
know
their
names
who
are
the
two
this
dirk
colson
whom
you
mentioned
which
was
he
alfred
described
him
as
well
as
his
bewilderment
would
allow
and
was
interrupted
oh
the
small
dark
one
i
know
he
interested
me
where
does
he
live
but
to
this
question
no
clear
answer
could
be
given
down
in
one
of
the
alleys
towards
the
south
end
but
just
which
alley
or
how
far
down
it
alfred
did
not
know
he
knew
it
was
a
disreputable
alley
and
that
there
was
a
decent
home
anywhere
about
it
and
that
was
all
what
does
dirk
do
for
a
living
this
question
was
quite
as
difficult
to
answer
as
the
other
nothing
young
ried
believed
at
least
nothing
regular
odd
jobs
he
doubtless
picked
up
occasionally
but
as
for
regular
employment
alfred
was
sure
he
had
none
is
that
his
fault
i
mean
does
he
desire
work
and
make
an
effort
to
secure
it
but
this
young
ried
could
not
even
pretend
to
answer
work
for
such
as
he
was
scarce
boys
with
better
habits
brought
up
to
be
industrious
were
at
this
present
time
out
of
work
possibly
the
fellow
was
not
to
blame
for
being
an
idler
many
other
questions
were
asked
and
many
attempts
were
made
at
answers
but
when
the
shoppers
began
to
press
in
to
such
a
degree
that
their
conversation
was
broken
and
the
energetic
seeker
after
information
felt
herself
obliged
to
retire
one
thing
had
been
accomplished
alfred
ried
had
been
made
to
realize
that
he
knew
much
less
than
he
had
supposed
he
did
about
the
seven
boys
who
had
seemed
to
be
filling
his
thoughts
for
several
weeks
and
also
in
his
eager
passionate
desire
that
everything
should
be
done
for
all
of
them
he
had
overlooked
the
chances
for
doing
here
and
there
some
little
thing
for
one
of
them
good
morning
roberts
had
said
turning
cordially
to
a
lady
collars
oh
yes
this
is
the
counter
for
them
to
be
found
in
endless
variety
they
have
a
new
pattern
that
i
have
been
admiring
ried
please
show
emory
the
curtain
collars
with
embroidered
which
thing
ried
proceeded
to
do
with
alacrity
and
respect
no
trace
of
the
earlier
contemptuous
feeling
shadowing
his
face
here
was
a
woman
who
knew
stylish
collars
when
she
saw
them
and
who
also
knew
several
other
things
and
had
taught
him
a
lesson
this
very
morning
that
he
would
not
be
likely
to
forget
but
roberts
as
she
made
her
way
out
from
the
store
felt
that
she
had
not
made
great
progress
toward
getting
acquainted
with
her
class
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
if
young
ried
had
gotten
some
new
ideas
so
also
had
she
a
christian
home
she
found
herself
repeating
the
phrase
lingering
over
it
wondering
if
her
new
home
in
every
sense
of
the
word
merited
that
title
it
can
not
simply
mean
a
home
where
christ
is
honored
she
said
to
herself
i
surely
have
that
it
rather
means
a
home
where
everything
pertaining
to
it
serves
his
cause
the
very
furniture
and
the
light
and
the
brightness
are
made
to
do
duty
for
him
else
they
have
no
place
there
and
i
labelled
christian
have
no
right
to
them
can
they
bear
the
test
i
wonder
what
is
there
that
i
can
do
with
all
the
beauties
of
my
parlors
there
are
things
that
i
have
not
done
i
can
see
some
to
do
but
how
can
my
christian
home
serve
these
boys
when
i
get
them
into
it
of
course
it
will
work
for
me
but
how
to
get
them
in
who
are
they
i
wonder
what
spring
i
can
touch
to
give
me
even
this
meagre
bit
of
information
as
if
in
answer
to
her
mental
query
she
came
just
then
full
upon
policeman
duffer
she
recognized
him
instantly
a
man
who
though
by
no
means
small
was
so
far
from
having
the
majestic
presence
of
most
policemen
that
in
the
estimation
of
the
boys
he
merited
the
name
little
roberts
carried
to
her
new
work
one
talent
not
always
to
be
found
among
even
efficient
workers
the
ability
to
remember
both
names
and
faces
especially
did
a
name
seem
without
any
effort
on
her
part
to
fasten
itself
upon
her
memory
and
not
only
that
but
it
brought
with
it
a
train
of
memories
enabling
her
to
locate
when
and
where
and
under
what
circumstances
she
heard
the
name
and
therefore
generally
whom
the
name
fitted
recognizing
the
features
of
the
policeman
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
door
of
the
south
end
mission
she
connected
him
at
once
with
the
term
little
duffer
heard
in
her
class
and
addressed
him
mr
duffer
i
it
is
safe
to
say
that
policeman
duffer
entirely
accustomed
as
he
was
to
hearing
himself
addressed
officially
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
times
a
day
was
yet
utterly
unaccustomed
to
the
prefix
of
and
started
in
surprise
are
you
not
the
gentleman
whom
i
saw
at
the
south
end
last
sabbath
the
policeman
admitted
that
he
probably
was
he
was
detailed
for
duty
there
then
she
plunged
at
once
into
business
did
he
know
the
boys
who
attended
that
school
some
of
them
he
did
better
than
he
wanted
to
and
a
precious
set
they
were
in
policeman
duffer
opinion
might
as
well
go
out
to
the
zoo
he
declared
and
get
a
set
of
animals
and
try
to
tame
roberts
was
not
in
the
mood
to
argue
she
was
bent
on
information
did
he
know
she
wondered
the
boys
who
composed
her
class
she
had
just
taken
the
class
and
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
be
acquainted
with
their
names
one
was
dirk
colson
and
another
she
had
heard
was
haskell
timothy
haskell
perhaps
though
of
that
she
was
not
certain
did
that
give
duffer
any
clue
plenty
of
clue
he
said
shaking
his
head
so
you
taken
that
class
a
curious
mixture
of
amazement
and
credulity
in
his
voice
what
possessed
you
if
i
may
be
so
bold
they
a
hard
lot
i
know
them
as
i
said
altogether
too
well
i
had
enough
to
do
with
some
of
them
and
i
expect
more
work
from
them
they
gain
in
wickedness
in
a
most
surprising
way
their
names
yes
there
scrawley
and
sneaking
billy
and
black
dirk
him
you
roberts
interrupted
him
she
begged
his
pardon
but
could
those
really
be
the
boys
names
were
they
not
rather
some
unfortunate
street
names
that
had
been
fastened
upon
them
thus
brought
back
to
his
senses
policeman
duffer
laughed
and
admitted
that
he
supposed
sneaking
billy
was
properly
named
sneyder
but
he
was
once
caught
in
a
mean
trick
from
which
he
tried
in
so
many
ways
to
squirm
out
that
the
boys
had
themselves
named
him
sneaking
billy
and
the
name
had
stuck
as
for
scrawley
his
real
name
was
stephen
crowley
how
it
became
contracted
into
scrawley
the
boys
could
tell
better
than
anybody
else
they
always
called
him
that
and
so
did
other
people
and
policeman
duffer
was
inclined
to
doubt
whether
the
fellow
remembered
that
he
had
any
other
name
you
can
see
yourself
he
added
how
black
dirk
came
by
his
name
he
is
the
blackest
white
fellow
as
ever
i
saw
and
i
seen
crowds
of
the
streets
were
full
and
policeman
duffer
was
being
interviewed
by
a
great
many
people
in
regard
to
all
the
questions
that
policemen
are
expected
to
answer
but
by
dint
of
patient
waiting
one
foot
poised
on
a
curbstone
to
keep
it
out
of
the
mud
making
hurried
little
memoranda
while
policeman
duffer
was
engaged
and
earnestly
plying
her
questions
when
he
was
at
leisure
roberts
learned
the
names
of
her
seven
boys
and
where
several
of
them
lived
chapter
vi
satan
he
has
all
the
that
black
dirk
is
a
case
said
policeman
duffer
turning
hastily
away
from
an
unusually
stupid
man
who
could
not
be
made
to
understand
where
a
certain
street
was
he
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
believe
jerry
tompkins
is
slyer
and
dick
bolton
is
quicker
than
lightning
at
mischief
nimble
dick
they
call
him
he
a
sort
of
ringleader
what
he
does
the
rest
are
apt
to
but
to
my
thinking
dirk
is
ahead
of
them
all
for
evil
the
rest
are
kind
of
jolly
fun
seems
to
be
about
half
that
they
are
after
but
dirk
he
sullen
you
never
know
how
to
take
him
nor
when
he
may
burst
out
on
you
he
dangerous
i
am
always
looking
out
for
something
awful
that
he
will
poor
dirk
yet
he
was
the
boy
to
whom
roberts
desires
had
gone
out
the
most
anxiously
it
was
over
his
image
that
she
had
lingered
that
morning
in
her
closet
policeman
duffer
would
have
been
greatly
astonished
had
he
known
there
was
that
in
his
words
which
gave
her
courage
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
with
quickening
breath
oh
perhaps
the
poor
boy
is
the
most
in
danger
of
them
all
and
the
saviour
knowing
it
sees
ways
in
which
i
may
reach
him
and
so
presses
his
poor
sullen
face
on
my
what
does
he
do
for
a
living
she
hastened
to
ask
well
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
loafs
for
a
living
that
all
i
ever
known
him
guilty
of
doing
he
got
a
drunken
father
one
of
the
meanest
kind
of
drunkards
if
he
would
go
and
stay
drunk
all
the
time
and
leave
them
alone
they
might
manage
but
he
has
spells
of
getting
half
over
it
and
coming
home
and
tearing
around
like
all
possessed
then
they
have
times
i
been
in
there
when
it
took
all
my
strength
to
manage
him
if
he
would
get
killed
in
one
of
his
rows
have
some
hope
of
the
rest
of
but
he
wo
that
kind
of
folks
never
do
get
killed
it
the
decent
ones
a
fellow
was
carried
by
here
just
with
a
broken
leg
a
nice
decent
boy
works
hard
to
help
his
sister
he
the
sort
now
that
gets
his
leg
broken
and
gets
laid
up
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
how
do
you
account
for
that
he
lives
pretty
near
black
dirk
of
course
he
got
a
drunken
father
they
all
have
in
that
row
but
if
i
was
going
in
for
benevolence
i
twice
as
soon
do
something
for
young
calkins
as
for
any
of
your
set
they
a
bad
lot
they
are
worth
lifting
a
finger
for
now
that
a
and
yet
said
roberts
her
voice
tremulous
with
a
feeling
that
just
then
surged
over
her
how
can
i
help
remembering
that
if
the
lord
jesus
had
said
that
of
us
and
stayed
up
there
in
his
glory
we
should
have
been
utterly
without
help
or
hope
very
much
astonished
was
policeman
duffer
ladies
on
all
sorts
of
errands
had
consulted
him
he
had
been
presented
with
many
tracts
in
his
day
but
rarely
had
a
woman
quietly
confronted
him
with
that
name
as
if
it
contained
an
unanswerable
argument
however
he
was
not
embarrassed
it
took
a
great
deal
to
embarrass
him
i
do
take
much
stock
in
him
he
said
with
a
lofty
toss
of
his
head
and
a
careless
tone
as
though
the
question
were
one
easy
to
dispose
of
i
do
believe
in
him
do
you
know
him
earnest
eyes
raised
to
his
face
fixed
steadily
on
his
face
while
the
questioner
waited
quietly
for
an
answer
policeman
duffer
was
embarrassed
now
he
was
not
used
to
being
confronted
with
such
questions
do
i
know
him
with
a
confused
little
laugh
why
i
reckon
not
according
to
the
popular
notion
he
is
too
far
away
for
folks
to
be
well
then
popular
notion
is
mistaken
for
i
know
him
very
well
indeed
and
he
is
by
no
means
far
away
but
what
i
meant
was
have
you
studied
his
life
and
character
and
do
you
fully
understand
the
arguments
for
believing
in
him
i
study
the
folks
who
profess
to
belong
to
him
and
i
find
that
about
as
much
as
i
can
this
was
said
with
a
saucy
little
laugh
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
believed
he
had
produced
an
unanswerable
argument
the
steady
eyes
did
not
move
from
his
face
and
the
voice
which
answered
him
had
lost
none
of
its
quietness
but
do
you
think
it
is
wise
to
spend
your
time
in
studying
the
imperfect
copies
without
looking
at
the
perfect
pattern
you
would
not
take
the
child
careless
imitation
as
a
proof
that
his
teacher
could
not
write
i
thank
you
for
helping
me
i
wish
you
would
help
my
boys
when
you
can
and
i
wish
you
would
study
my
master
instead
of
me
good
that
a
queer
party
did
policeman
duffer
exclaim
as
he
watched
her
far
down
the
street
i
blessed
if
i
would
like
to
know
who
she
is
she
ai
like
the
rest
somehow
boys
much
she
knows
about
her
she
might
as
well
call
what
does
she
think
she
can
do
with
that
set
in
her
little
hour
sunday
afternoon
satan
he
has
all
the
week
and
looks
after
sharp
and
then
these
christians
come
in
of
a
sunday
and
mince
a
little
and
think
they
can
upset
his
doings
by
it
shows
their
sense
but
she
a
curious
little
party
sharp
without
knowing
it
i
blessed
if
i
do
keep
an
eye
on
her
and
save
her
from
scrapes
if
i
meantime
all
unconscious
of
his
good
intentions
roberts
pursued
her
way
down
the
thronged
avenue
and
presently
turned
from
it
entirely
and
moved
down
one
of
the
with
resolute
steps
a
daring
thought
had
come
into
her
mind
she
would
try
to
find
the
alley
where
one
at
least
of
her
boys
lived
it
could
be
worse
than
some
of
the
alleys
at
home
which
she
had
penetrated
she
felt
certain
that
by
following
the
policeman
directions
she
could
find
the
place
and
possibly
be
able
to
minister
to
the
boy
with
a
broken
limb
at
all
events
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
know
how
her
boys
lived
and
where
they
lived
if
she
were
to
reach
them
but
there
are
alleys
and
as
the
venturesome
lady
found
to
her
cost
this
one
into
which
she
was
plunging
excelled
anything
in
that
line
which
she
had
ever
imagined
swarming
with
life
in
its
most
repulsive
forms
and
growing
every
moment
more
terrifying
to
a
woman
braving
its
horrors
alone
she
stopped
in
dismay
at
last
admitting
reluctantly
that
the
wisest
thing
she
could
do
was
to
turn
around
and
go
home
possibly
the
but
not
it
appeared
practicable
where
home
down
which
of
the
had
she
come
did
this
one
where
she
stood
lead
to
it
or
did
it
lead
as
it
appeared
to
her
in
an
entirely
opposite
direction
she
looked
up
and
down
and
across
for
some
familiar
landmark
and
looked
in
vain
growing
momentarily
more
frightened
at
the
attention
she
was
attracting
by
standing
irresolutely
there
flossy
shipley
in
her
girlhood
days
had
been
almost
a
hopeless
coward
and
flossy
roberts
felt
by
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
that
she
had
not
yet
outgrown
her
girlish
character
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
delight
and
with
a
spring
forward
laid
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
one
whom
she
recognized
none
other
than
nimble
dick
himself
i
am
so
glad
she
said
to
the
amazed
young
scamp
a
little
quiver
of
satisfaction
in
her
voice
so
glad
to
have
met
you
do
you
know
you
are
a
friend
in
need
i
have
lost
my
way
i
can
not
decide
which
way
to
turn
to
reach
fifth
avenue
again
will
you
help
me
please
when
had
nimble
dick
lost
an
opportunity
for
fun
at
the
expense
of
another
here
was
a
chance
for
a
jolly
lark
a
woman
scared
to
death
because
she
was
on
green
alley
what
would
she
think
of
burk
street
suppose
he
should
send
her
there
only
three
blocks
away
through
a
lovelier
part
of
the
city
than
she
had
seen
yet
he
would
venture
if
the
crowds
here
showed
her
too
much
attention
it
would
be
worth
something
to
see
how
she
got
through
burk
street
oh
yes
he
said
briskly
i
can
show
you
the
way
in
a
twinkling
you
just
go
down
this
alley
till
you
come
to
the
big
house
on
the
corner
that
has
the
windows
all
knocked
out
of
it
then
you
turn
and
go
down
that
street
till
you
get
to
the
third
crossing
then
turn
again
to
the
right
and
you
be
on
fifth
avenue
before
you
know
had
roberts
been
looking
at
his
face
she
would
have
seen
the
wicked
light
dancing
in
his
eyes
over
the
thought
that
he
had
thus
mapped
out
for
her
a
walk
through
the
very
worst
portion
of
the
city
every
step
of
course
leading
her
further
and
further
away
from
fifth
avenue
the
sights
that
she
might
see
and
the
mishaps
which
might
occur
to
her
a
woman
alone
before
she
made
her
way
through
the
horrors
of
these
streets
were
too
much
even
for
nimble
dick
imagination
who
knew
the
locality
well
he
did
not
try
to
calculate
them
but
gave
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
imagining
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
would
reach
home
if
she
followed
his
directions
she
wo
see
no
swallowing
serpents
that
i
knows
of
he
reflected
gleefully
but
i
miss
my
reckoning
if
she
do
see
what
will
scare
her
worse
than
they
but
roberts
was
already
she
felt
her
heart
beating
hard
and
knew
that
her
cheeks
were
aglow
with
excitement
and
vague
terror
she
was
not
used
to
walking
such
streets
alone
she
looked
ahead
at
the
way
pointed
out
and
could
see
that
the
swarming
life
grew
more
turbid
as
far
as
her
eye
could
reach
she
felt
that
she
could
not
brave
its
terrors
unprotected
suddenly
she
turned
from
looking
down
the
alley
and
her
hand
a
small
hand
was
again
laid
on
nimble
dick
arm
he
could
feel
it
trembling
i
suppose
i
shall
seem
very
foolish
to
you
she
said
gently
but
i
am
afraid
to
walk
down
there
alone
would
you
mind
going
along
with
me
to
protect
me
i
am
only
a
woman
you
know
and
we
are
apt
to
be
a
very
curious
sensation
came
over
nimble
dick
he
looked
up
the
alley
and
down
the
alley
and
was
glad
that
not
one
of
the
fellows
was
in
sight
what
was
to
become
of
his
lark
but
there
was
that
hand
still
resting
on
his
arm
with
a
persuasive
touch
in
it
and
he
had
never
been
appealed
to
for
protection
before
never
in
his
life
was
it
possible
that
with
she
would
not
be
afraid
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
searchingly
a
scowl
on
his
face
no
she
was
not
shamming
her
eyes
were
full
of
anxious
fear
and
also
of
petition
nimble
dick
was
amazed
at
himself
and
ashamed
of
himself
he
did
not
know
how
to
account
for
his
sudden
change
of
intention
but
he
suddenly
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
one
which
he
had
pointed
out
and
said
come
on
then
i
show
you
a
shorter
way
and
strode
forward
oh
thank
you
she
said
relief
and
gratitude
in
her
voice
i
shall
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
with
me
i
am
quite
bewildered
can
not
decide
which
way
i
came
or
anything
about
it
i
was
trying
to
find
the
house
of
a
young
man
who
has
been
hurt
a
policeman
told
me
that
he
lived
on
this
street
and
that
his
name
is
calkins
i
was
thinking
about
him
and
walked
on
without
noticing
until
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
do
you
know
anything
of
the
young
man
you
are
too
far
down
for
him
said
nimble
dick
he
quality
and
lives
at
the
upper
end
of
the
alley
that
his
house
away
up
there
he
hurt
bad
they
say
but
i
he
get
well
he
got
a
quality
doctor
a
regular
swell
who
never
come
into
these
alleys
before
he
was
going
along
when
they
brought
mark
home
and
he
followed
them
in
and
he
come
there
again
last
night
and
this
morning
i
dunno
what
for
i
sure
mark
calkins
ca
pay
no
doctor
bills
if
he
does
work
regular
and
pay
more
rent
than
the
rest
of
there
was
a
curious
mixture
of
complaint
and
satisfaction
in
tone
roberts
gathered
from
it
that
the
young
man
mark
calkins
in
whom
the
policeman
had
tried
to
interest
her
was
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
miserable
people
in
the
alley
and
that
they
resented
it
as
an
insult
to
themselves
but
that
at
the
same
time
the
reflected
honor
of
having
a
swell
doctor
come
into
their
midst
attendant
upon
one
who
really
belonged
to
their
class
was
very
great
could
she
possibly
get
a
little
influence
over
them
by
following
up
the
injured
young
man
and
giving
what
help
was
needful
she
had
hardly
meant
to
call
though
trying
to
find
the
house
her
method
of
reasoning
had
been
something
like
this
the
policeman
said
he
lived
about
two
blocks
from
my
poor
dirk
home
since
there
has
so
recently
been
an
accident
there
may
be
something
to
mark
the
house
a
doctor
passing
in
possibly
or
something
that
shall
give
me
a
landmark
and
i
can
have
a
glimpse
of
the
outside
of
one
of
the
in
her
ignorance
of
life
at
that
end
of
the
social
scale
she
did
not
know
that
a
doctor
passing
in
and
out
even
after
an
accident
was
a
sufficiently
rare
occurrence
to
make
much
more
of
a
mark
than
she
was
looking
for
so
absorbed
had
she
been
over
the
boys
belonging
to
her
class
that
she
had
rather
ignored
the
manifest
hint
to
add
this
one
to
her
list
yet
was
it
possibly
an
answer
to
her
prayer
an
of
some
sort
that
might
open
the
way
to
influence
who
is
the
doctor
she
asked
her
guide
as
the
possibility
of
making
an
entrance
through
him
occurred
to
her
do
you
know
his
name
oh
yes
dick
knew
his
name
and
where
he
lived
and
even
the
names
of
some
of
his
swell
patients
trust
him
for
gaining
information
about
anything
that
came
into
the
alley
it
everett
he
said
promptly
that
curious
touch
of
pride
appearing
again
in
his
voice
he
lives
away
up
among
the
and
he
goes
to
cady
house
to
doctor
and
lots
of
them
places
where
the
big
ones
lives
i
dunno
how
he
happens
to
come
roberts
had
never
heard
the
name
but
she
reflected
that
she
was
a
and
wisely
desisted
from
taking
from
the
glory
of
everett
by
admitting
that
he
was
not
known
to
all
the
world
he
might
be
a
good
doctor
and
a
philanthropic
one
his
visits
to
this
region
looked
like
it
do
you
know
where
any
of
the
boys
in
our
class
live
this
was
her
next
question
she
did
not
know
whether
to
hint
that
she
had
heard
of
one
who
lived
in
that
alley
or
whether
this
would
be
considered
an
insult
well
said
nimble
dick
the
sly
twinkle
coming
back
to
his
eyes
that
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
had
driven
away
for
a
moment
i
calculate
that
i
know
where
i
live
sometimes
i
do
to
be
sure
she
said
laughing
at
his
humor
i
should
have
said
where
any
of
the
others
live
of
course
you
will
give
me
your
address
after
being
so
kind
as
to
see
me
to
some
point
where
i
am
she
had
nearly
said
a
place
of
safety
but
checked
herself
in
time
i
am
not
sure
though
that
dick
would
have
noticed
it
he
was
lost
in
astonishment
over
the
idea
of
giving
anybody
his
address
this
is
dirk
colson
house
he
said
suddenly
and
he
is
one
of
our
roberts
uttered
an
exclamation
the
house
was
one
of
the
most
forlorn
in
the
row
seeming
if
the
miserable
state
of
the
buildings
would
admit
of
comparison
to
be
more
out
of
repair
than
the
others
it
came
home
to
her
just
then
with
a
sudden
desolating
force
that
human
beings
such
as
she
was
trying
to
reach
and
such
as
she
hoped
would
live
in
heaven
forever
called
such
earthly
habitations
as
these
homes
what
possible
idea
could
they
ever
get
of
heaven
by
calling
it
home
do
they
have
the
whole
of
the
house
she
asked
the
question
timidly
for
the
building
looked
very
large
but
she
was
utterly
unused
to
city
tenement
life
the
of
that
house
dick
fairly
shouted
the
sentence
and
bent
himself
double
with
laughter
well
i
should
say
not
mum
as
near
as
i
can
calculate
about
different
families
have
that
pleasure
the
whole
of
the
house
oh
my
what
a
greeny
and
he
laughed
again
roberts
exerted
herself
to
laugh
with
him
albeit
she
was
families
in
one
house
how
could
they
be
other
than
awful
in
their
ways
of
living
i
know
almost
nothing
about
great
cities
she
said
my
home
was
in
a
much
smaller
this
was
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth
instinct
kept
this
veritable
lady
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
from
explaining
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
abject
poor
when
she
was
speaking
to
one
of
their
number
just
at
this
moment
occurred
a
diversion
they
had
been
making
swift
progress
through
the
alley
dick
long
strides
requiring
effort
on
his
companion
part
to
keep
by
his
side
but
just
ahead
the
way
was
obstructed
chapter
vii
what
a
little
schemer
it
a
riot
not
among
men
which
is
sufficiently
terrifying
nor
yet
among
women
which
is
worse
but
that
most
awful
of
all
sights
and
sounds
of
sin
a
riot
among
the
children
swearing
spitting
at
one
another
tearing
one
another
hair
scratching
like
tigers
growling
like
wild
beasts
throwing
garbage
at
one
another
this
was
the
sort
of
crowd
upon
which
roberts
in
her
black
silk
with
her
velvet
hat
and
seal
furs
presently
came
she
grasped
at
dick
arm
in
horror
but
a
feeling
that
was
more
than
terror
was
taking
her
strength
away
oh
she
said
and
the
agony
in
her
voice
really
suggested
more
than
terror
to
the
young
fellow
beside
her
and
they
are
little
children
they
can
not
be
more
than
seven
or
eight
oh
what
can
i
do
you
need
be
scared
mum
there
was
a
little
hint
of
something
like
pity
in
dick
voice
she
clung
to
him
so
that
he
could
not
help
feeling
himself
her
protector
it
ai
an
uncommon
row
at
all
they
mostly
act
like
this
most
likely
one
of
found
a
bone
and
t
other
one
wants
it
and
then
they
gone
in
for
a
row
and
all
the
young
ones
crowd
around
and
fight
on
one
side
or
t
did
this
fearful
explanation
make
the
situation
less
terrible
there
was
a
lull
however
in
the
quarrel
the
lady
was
seen
approaching
an
unusual
sight
in
that
alley
and
both
parties
paused
to
get
a
view
paused
in
their
attentions
to
each
other
that
is
but
at
roberts
they
hooted
and
jeered
and
one
threw
a
handful
of
mud
then
did
nimble
dick
rise
to
his
position
as
protector
shut
up
there
stand
aside
pluck
and
let
us
pass
look
out
there
you
smirchy
do
you
throw
that
over
here
unless
you
want
your
head
broke
for
you
when
i
get
back
this
threat
was
thrown
at
a
wretched
little
girl
who
had
dived
her
hand
deeply
into
a
box
or
cask
of
garbage
and
brought
it
forth
reeking
with
rotten
apples
pork
fat
and
any
liquid
horror
which
the
name
suggests
to
you
she
had
her
hand
uplifted
ready
to
throw
and
was
evidently
intending
to
give
the
strange
lady
the
benefit
of
what
she
had
prepared
for
one
of
the
rioters
the
assured
tone
in
which
nimble
dick
spoke
had
its
effect
the
combatants
were
all
small
and
he
was
large
and
was
evidently
recognized
as
a
power
there
were
some
defiant
glances
thrown
at
him
but
the
motley
crowd
gave
way
and
allowed
him
to
pass
uninjured
still
he
kept
an
alert
watch
of
them
until
quite
out
of
reach
and
was
not
sparing
of
his
admonitions
hold
on
there
bill
i
see
that
look
out
sally
you
be
sorry
if
you
throw
anything
mind
you
that
and
at
last
they
were
through
the
crowd
not
out
of
danger
it
seemed
for
there
directly
in
their
narrow
path
was
a
drunken
man
swaying
from
side
to
side
in
the
way
which
is
so
terrible
to
one
unused
to
such
sights
dick
felt
the
hold
on
his
arm
tighten
and
was
astonished
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
as
he
said
soothingly
you
need
be
scared
at
him
mum
that
only
old
jock
he
as
ugly
as
old
nick
himself
but
he
knows
better
than
to
be
very
ugly
to
me
i
can
throw
him
in
the
gutter
as
easy
as
i
could
them
young
ones
and
he
knows
it
that
dirk
father
that
is
ai
he
a
beauty
and
again
roberts
uttered
an
exclamation
of
dismay
and
part
of
her
terror
went
out
in
sorrow
over
the
wrongs
of
a
boy
who
had
such
a
home
and
such
a
father
what
ought
to
be
expected
of
him
that
interminable
alley
was
conquered
at
last
and
they
emerged
into
respectability
on
the
broad
avenue
roberts
released
her
hold
of
her
protector
arm
and
his
new
character
vanished
on
the
instant
you
here
mum
he
said
with
a
saucy
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
saucy
leer
on
his
face
can
you
get
yourself
home
from
this
spot
or
shall
i
borrow
a
wheelbarrow
and
tote
you
there
much
shaken
with
various
emotions
though
she
was
roberts
forced
herself
to
laugh
she
would
not
frown
on
his
fun
when
it
was
not
positively
sinful
he
might
not
be
aware
that
it
was
disrespectful
he
might
never
have
heard
the
word
i
know
the
way
now
thank
you
at
least
i
think
i
do
can
you
tell
me
whether
i
take
a
green
car
or
a
yellow
one
to
get
to
east
street
you
take
a
green
one
he
said
quietly
his
character
of
protector
having
returned
to
him
with
the
question
which
still
showed
her
dependence
on
him
thank
you
she
said
again
with
great
heartiness
i
shall
never
forget
your
care
of
her
hand
was
in
her
pocket
and
a
bright
coin
was
between
her
fingers
she
longed
to
give
it
to
nimble
dick
he
had
saved
her
from
so
much
this
morning
and
he
was
so
miserably
clad
surely
he
needed
help
a
moment
reflection
and
she
resolutely
withdrew
her
hand
he
should
be
paid
by
a
simple
hearty
thank
you
this
morning
for
kindness
rendered
he
might
not
consider
it
a
current
coin
but
possibly
it
would
be
his
first
lesson
in
the
courtesies
of
life
later
in
the
day
when
roberts
was
somewhat
rested
from
her
morning
campaign
young
ried
received
a
little
note
dear
ried
i
know
the
names
of
all
the
boys
and
inclose
you
a
list
it
is
possible
that
you
may
fall
in
with
some
one
during
the
day
who
can
impart
knowledge
concerning
them
anyway
i
thought
you
would
like
to
know
their
names
keep
me
posted
please
as
to
your
success
in
making
their
acquaintance
we
are
allies
remember
yours
for
the
master
roberts
alfred
ried
twisted
the
delicate
thoughtfully
in
his
hand
a
look
of
perplexity
on
his
face
he
felt
committed
for
labor
glad
was
he
very
yet
perplexed
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
where
to
commence
well
neither
had
this
little
lady
yet
she
had
accomplished
more
in
her
one
day
acquaintance
than
he
after
a
lapse
of
weeks
either
she
had
found
opportunities
or
had
made
them
there
must
be
chances
he
would
be
sure
to
keep
his
eyes
open
after
this
in
the
handsome
house
on
east
street
where
roberts
had
settled
his
bride
after
a
somewhat
extended
business
tour
involving
months
of
absence
matters
were
in
train
for
a
cosy
evening
in
the
library
that
was
the
name
of
the
beautiful
room
where
the
husband
and
wife
sat
down
together
but
it
was
quite
unlike
the
conventional
library
books
there
were
in
lavish
abundance
but
there
were
also
pictures
and
flowers
and
a
or
two
and
an
utter
absence
of
that
severe
attention
to
business
details
which
characterizes
most
rooms
so
named
little
prettinesses
which
roberts
smilingly
admitted
did
not
belong
to
a
library
were
yet
established
there
with
an
air
of
having
come
to
stay
we
will
call
it
the
library
for
convenience
the
master
of
the
house
said
and
then
we
will
put
into
it
whatever
we
please
it
shall
be
a
conservatory
and
a
and
a
and
anything
else
that
you
and
i
choose
to
make
and
roberts
gleefully
assented
and
gave
free
rein
to
her
pretty
tastes
flossy
shipley
had
been
wont
to
be
much
trammelled
with
the
ways
in
which
they
did
everything
but
evan
roberts
was
learning
that
in
unimportant
matters
at
least
they
had
a
right
to
be
a
law
unto
themselves
perhaps
it
helped
her
to
be
aware
that
a
large
class
of
people
were
all
ready
to
quote
mrs
evan
roberts
as
authority
on
almost
any
point
of
taste
on
the
evening
in
question
roberts
in
and
slippers
had
drawn
his
to
the
preparatory
to
a
of
reading
aloud
but
it
transpired
that
there
was
something
preparatory
to
that
or
at
least
that
must
take
the
precedence
certain
business
telegrams
followed
him
home
which
required
the
writing
of
two
or
three
business
letters
it
will
not
take
me
long
he
explained
to
his
wife
and
they
are
not
complicated
affairs
so
i
give
you
leave
to
talk
right
on
while
i
dispatch
she
laughed
at
this
hint
about
her
fondness
for
talk
but
presently
made
use
of
the
privilege
evan
what
sort
of
a
young
man
do
you
consider
ried
ried
who
oh
my
clerk
the
very
best
sort
a
most
estimable
fellow
one
of
a
thousand
by
the
way
did
you
tell
him
how
you
became
interested
in
that
sister
of
his
not
yet
i
want
to
get
better
acquainted
but
evan
do
you
know
where
he
boards
hardly
on
third
avenue
somewhere
i
believe
or
possibly
second
the
store
register
would
show
do
you
want
his
address
oh
i
know
it
is
but
i
mean
what
sort
of
a
place
is
it
roberts
slightly
elevated
his
shapely
shoulders
it
is
a
where
many
clerks
board
that
tells
a
doleful
story
to
the
initiated
i
suspect
poor
fare
and
dismal
surroundings
still
it
is
eminently
where
does
he
spend
his
sabbaths
the
pen
executed
nearly
two
lines
of
handsome
writing
before
roberts
was
ready
to
respond
to
this
question
why
at
church
principally
i
fancy
he
is
very
regular
in
his
attendance
at
morning
service
and
the
south
end
mission
absorbs
his
afternoons
i
suppose
he
goes
to
church
in
the
evening
but
since
we
have
been
giving
our
attention
to
that
evening
mission
i
have
not
seen
ah
but
evan
i
mean
the
rest
of
the
time
those
little
bits
of
sabbath
time
that
are
sacred
to
home
the
twilight
for
instance
or
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
do
you
know
what
sort
of
a
place
he
has
for
those
times
nearly
three
more
lines
added
to
the
paper
then
roberts
raised
his
head
no
my
dear
i
do
now
that
you
bring
me
face
to
face
with
the
question
it
seems
a
surprising
thing
to
say
that
i
should
not
know
where
a
young
man
who
has
been
for
more
than
a
year
in
our
employ
spends
his
choice
bits
of
time
but
i
then
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
it
he
has
a
dingy
back
room
small
i
fancy
from
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
it
and
not
a
speck
of
fire
over
in
such
weather
as
this
how
can
a
young
man
read
his
bible
or
even
pray
under
such
circumstances
roberts
laid
down
his
pen
and
sat
erect
regarding
his
wife
with
a
thoughtful
air
flossy
he
said
at
last
it
is
an
immense
question
you
open
a
perfect
mine
of
anxiety
and
doubt
i
have
hovered
around
the
edges
for
some
time
but
have
generally
contrived
to
shut
my
eyes
and
refuse
to
look
into
it
because
i
was
afraid
of
what
i
might
see
and
because
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
my
knowledge
i
have
not
been
the
working
member
of
the
firm
very
long
you
know
and
my
special
field
until
lately
has
been
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
but
i
have
been
at
home
long
enough
to
know
that
there
are
several
hundred
young
men
in
our
employ
who
are
away
from
their
homes
and
knowing
as
i
do
the
price
of
board
in
respectable
houses
and
knowing
the
salaries
which
the
younger
ones
receive
it
does
not
require
a
great
deal
of
penetration
to
discover
that
they
must
have
rather
dreary
homes
here
to
put
it
mildly
the
fact
is
flossy
i
have
wanted
to
look
into
this
thing
very
closely
because
i
do
not
see
the
remedy
look
at
our
house
for
instance
with
its
three
hundred
clerks
we
say
who
are
away
from
their
friends
suppose
or
even
of
them
are
miserably
situated
what
can
i
do
are
they
not
sufficiently
well
paid
to
have
the
ordinary
comforts
of
life
doubtful
the
truth
is
what
you
and
i
call
the
ordinary
comforts
of
life
takes
a
good
deal
of
money
and
in
the
city
rents
are
high
and
the
keepers
have
hard
struggles
to
make
their
expenditures
meet
their
income
and
they
carry
economy
to
the
very
verge
of
meanness
some
of
them
fairly
over
the
verge
i
presume
and
the
result
is
cheap
food
badly
cooked
because
food
means
help
and
cold
rooms
and
dreariness
and
discomfort
everywhere
now
what
can
be
done
about
it
then
our
house
is
only
one
of
hundreds
and
in
many
of
these
hundreds
they
employ
more
help
and
give
less
wages
than
we
in
fact
i
know
that
some
of
our
clerks
are
looked
upon
with
envy
by
a
great
many
young
men
we
never
have
any
trouble
in
supplying
vacancies
people
swarm
around
us
because
we
have
the
reputation
of
being
liberal
we
are
not
liberal
however
sometimes
i
am
inclined
to
think
we
are
hardly
fair
yet
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
i
am
a
junior
partner
with
a
great
deal
of
the
responsibility
and
a
third
of
the
voting
power
and
i
ca
get
salaries
raised
i
been
working
at
that
problem
at
intervals
for
a
year
and
have
accomplished
very
little
do
you
wonder
that
i
keep
my
eyes
as
closely
shut
as
i
can
his
wife
face
wore
a
thoughtful
not
to
say
perplexed
look
she
seemed
to
have
no
answer
ready
and
after
waiting
a
moment
for
it
roberts
bent
himself
again
to
the
task
of
getting
his
business
letters
answered
before
he
had
written
one
more
line
her
face
had
cleared
she
interrupted
him
evan
when
you
talk
about
four
hundred
clerks
and
multiply
that
by
hundreds
of
houses
and
more
hundreds
of
clerks
i
can
not
follow
you
at
all
it
is
not
that
i
am
not
impressed
with
the
number
i
am
it
appalls
me
but
i
do
want
to
be
appalled
i
want
to
be
helpful
perhaps
just
now
there
is
nothing
that
i
can
do
for
the
hundreds
so
i
want
to
narrow
my
thoughts
down
to
what
possibly
i
can
do
what
for
instance
can
be
done
towards
getting
a
good
young
man
like
alfred
ried
into
a
place
that
will
be
just
a
little
bit
like
a
home
that
will
give
him
a
spot
where
he
can
study
his
bible
in
comfort
and
invite
a
friend
with
whom
he
wants
to
pray
or
whom
he
wants
to
reach
and
help
in
any
way
that
is
a
huge
problem
ca
it
be
solved
her
husband
smiled
he
is
only
one
of
thousands
he
said
yes
i
know
but
he
is
of
thousands
since
we
can
not
reach
thousands
shall
we
fail
to
reach
one
evan
i
am
only
one
of
thousands
but
but
how
would
you
argue
about
me
roberts
laughed
again
you
are
one
out
of
thousands
and
thousands
he
said
emphatically
a
line
more
and
he
signed
the
firm
name
with
an
unusually
fine
flourish
there
i
accomplished
one
letter
what
do
you
want
to
do
flossy
i
want
ried
to
have
a
room
where
he
can
invite
one
of
my
boys
occasionally
and
make
him
comfortable
and
do
for
him
what
we
can
not
with
our
rooms
do
for
him
what
only
a
young
man
can
do
for
a
young
man
i
do
clearly
know
what
i
want
further
than
that
but
i
see
that
one
thing
as
a
remember
i
want
all
your
thousands
to
have
just
as
pleasant
rooms
and
i
would
like
to
help
to
bring
it
about
but
i
do
just
now
see
the
do
you
see
the
way
to
this
no
but
does
it
seem
as
though
we
ought
to
be
able
to
accomplish
so
much
it
does
certainly
what
is
your
desire
flossy
do
you
want
him
to
have
a
room
in
our
house
she
shook
her
head
no
that
would
not
further
my
plan
for
those
boys
i
would
like
to
have
him
here
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
him
at
least
i
think
it
would
but
i
can
see
things
which
he
could
accomplish
for
these
young
men
set
by
himself
in
a
different
part
of
the
city
besides
evan
i
have
other
plans
for
our
rooms
entirely
different
ones
and
some
of
them
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
are
very
he
answered
the
doubt
with
a
smile
that
said
he
had
no
fears
of
her
or
her
plans
what
a
little
schemer
it
is
he
said
looking
down
on
her
with
fond
proud
eyes
who
would
have
imagined
that
she
could
plot
and
plot
so
mysteriously
i
used
to
think
she
was
a
very
chapter
viii
what
would
you
do
dear
she
joined
in
his
laugh
albeit
there
was
a
tender
look
in
her
eyes
after
a
moment
she
said
gently
it
is
not
scheming
evan
i
am
only
trying
to
set
about
the
work
for
which
i
have
been
chosen
i
tell
you
how
it
all
came
to
me
i
was
reading
my
morning
reading
you
know
after
you
had
gone
taking
little
dips
here
and
there
in
the
fashion
that
you
think
is
so
unsystematic
and
i
came
upon
this
verse
is
a
chosen
vessel
unto
me
you
know
about
paul
well
it
came
to
me
with
a
sudden
sense
of
awe
and
beauty
the
being
chosen
of
god
to
do
a
great
work
i
stopped
reading
to
think
it
out
what
a
grand
moment
it
must
have
been
to
paul
when
he
realized
it
and
i
began
to
feel
almost
sorry
that
we
lived
in
such
different
times
with
no
such
opportunities
i
stopped
right
in
the
midst
of
my
folly
to
remember
that
i
was
as
certainly
chosen
of
god
as
ever
paul
was
for
assuredly
i
did
not
come
to
him
of
myself
nor
begin
to
love
him
of
myself
and
therefore
he
must
indeed
have
chosen
me
and
i
wondered
whether
probably
each
christian
had
not
a
work
to
do
as
definite
as
paul
a
work
that
would
be
given
to
no
other
unless
indeed
the
chosen
one
failed
i
did
not
want
to
fail
and
i
asked
god
not
to
let
me
then
of
course
i
set
to
wondering
what
my
work
or
my
part
of
some
other
person
work
could
be
it
was
the
morning
after
you
had
told
me
that
about
ester
ried
you
can
not
think
how
that
impressed
me
i
could
not
get
away
from
the
wonderment
as
to
how
her
work
was
prospering
and
whether
there
were
chosen
ones
enough
or
if
there
might
possibly
be
a
little
place
for
me
i
could
settle
anything
and
finally
i
decided
to
look
at
paul
work
a
little
while
of
course
it
was
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
duties
of
the
great
apostle
had
anything
in
common
with
my
bits
of
effort
still
i
said
the
directions
given
him
may
help
me
a
little
and
evan
what
do
you
think
was
the
first
thing
i
found
why
this
god
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
thee
that
thou
know
his
surely
so
far
the
things
for
which
both
he
and
i
were
chosen
were
parallel
i
looked
further
see
that
just
one
that
was
the
very
next
was
not
i
too
chosen
for
that
eyes
shall
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
i
said
over
the
beautiful
promise
to
assure
myself
that
it
was
true
and
went
on
shouldst
hear
the
voice
of
his
mouth
was
it
not
strange
evan
certainly
i
shall
hear
my
king
speak
often
and
often
when
i
get
home
only
think
of
it
so
far
paul
was
not
ahead
of
me
i
hurried
to
find
another
reference
to
paul
work
and
i
found
this
let
me
read
it
to
her
bit
of
dainty
sewing
was
suddenly
pushed
one
side
and
up
from
the
depths
of
the
came
a
small
bible
much
marked
a
rapid
turning
of
the
leaves
and
the
eager
disciple
read
i
have
appeared
unto
thee
for
this
purpose
to
make
thee
a
minister
and
a
witness
both
of
these
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
of
those
things
in
the
which
i
will
appear
unto
thee
now
evan
you
know
the
veriest
child
can
be
a
witness
if
he
knows
anything
about
the
facts
and
i
do
certainly
know
some
wonderful
things
about
jesus
to
which
i
could
witness
and
besides
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
will
appear
to
me
every
day
with
things
for
me
to
witness
to
and
then
i
read
this
paul
sent
to
the
gentiles
you
know
but
for
what
open
their
eyes
and
to
turn
them
from
darkness
to
light
and
from
the
power
of
satan
unto
god
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
me
evan
was
there
ever
a
more
wonderful
work
to
do
in
the
world
than
that
and
yet
i
can
not
tell
you
how
it
made
me
feel
to
discover
or
at
least
to
realize
that
a
great
deal
of
it
was
my
work
of
course
i
naturally
began
to
ask
myself
what
gentile
was
there
for
me
to
reach
whose
eyes
must
i
try
to
open
do
you
know
that
very
afternoon
i
met
ried
and
heard
of
those
boys
they
interested
me
from
the
first
and
what
he
told
me
about
his
sister
increased
the
interest
then
when
i
saw
them
evan
if
ever
boys
were
in
the
power
of
satan
they
are
and
to
think
that
they
may
have
an
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
this
morning
when
i
saw
where
some
some
of
them
lived
and
imagined
how
they
lived
i
fell
stunned
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
what
means
could
possibly
be
found
of
sufficient
power
to
fit
them
for
such
an
inheritance
and
then
directly
came
the
closing
words
of
the
commission
faith
that
is
in
me
evan
god
will
save
them
and
i
think
he
will
let
me
amen
said
roberts
and
his
voice
was
husky
when
his
wife
was
in
one
of
her
exalted
moods
he
always
admired
her
with
a
sort
of
reverence
he
had
been
for
years
an
earnest
worker
he
carried
business
plans
and
business
principles
into
the
work
he
studied
cause
and
effect
and
calculated
and
expected
certain
results
to
follow
certain
causes
like
a
mathematical
problem
not
that
he
by
any
means
forgot
the
power
of
faith
or
in
any
sense
attempted
to
do
his
work
alone
he
was
a
christian
who
spent
much
time
on
his
knees
but
little
flossy
brought
so
much
of
the
childlike
unquestioning
spirit
into
her
work
that
sometimes
he
stood
in
awe
not
knowing
whether
he
could
follow
her
it
was
not
so
much
a
mathematical
problem
to
be
worked
out
as
it
was
the
faith
that
can
remove
mountains
as
a
little
child
relies
on
a
strength
beyond
his
own
knows
he
is
neither
strong
nor
wise
fears
to
stir
a
step
alone
roberts
often
found
himself
quoting
these
lines
when
his
wife
gave
him
glimpses
of
her
heart
and
at
such
times
he
had
no
hesitancy
in
deciding
that
the
steps
she
took
were
not
alone
but
the
lord
was
with
her
the
postman
ring
broke
in
on
their
quiet
i
hope
there
are
letters
from
home
roberts
said
real
long
ones
it
is
a
week
since
we
have
and
i
ought
to
hope
that
they
would
require
a
first
reading
in
private
her
husband
answered
as
he
seized
his
neglected
pen
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
these
business
letters
will
get
answered
i
find
the
temptation
to
talk
to
you
one
letter
but
that
was
of
comfortable
dimensions
and
weight
it
is
from
marion
roberts
said
delight
in
her
voice
after
the
first
glance
at
the
familiar
writing
she
was
presently
lost
in
its
many
pages
and
the
business
of
went
on
uninterruptedly
for
some
time
marion
dennis
had
not
forgotten
her
fondness
for
her
pretty
little
flossy
nor
forgotten
that
little
creature
though
she
was
she
possessed
a
wisdom
far
above
those
who
are
credited
with
having
keen
insight
even
a
wisdom
so
subtle
and
withal
so
tender
that
its
source
could
only
be
infinite
wisdom
so
she
in
company
with
many
others
was
learning
to
turn
to
the
friend
so
much
younger
than
herself
as
one
in
whom
she
could
safely
confide
dear
little
flossy
so
the
letter
ran
i
suppose
though
you
should
live
to
be
a
old
lady
sitting
with
placid
face
and
fluted
cap
and
spectacles
in
your
in
the
most
treasured
corner
mayhap
of
some
granddaughter
choicest
room
i
writing
to
you
would
still
commence
little
flossy
that
i
have
to
cover
it
from
prying
eyes
by
the
dignified
and
respectable
evan
roberts
is
almost
a
matter
of
amusement
to
me
i
fancy
i
can
see
you
making
a
journey
through
some
of
the
chautauqua
avenues
picking
your
way
daintily
towards
palestine
bending
lovingly
over
the
small
white
stones
that
mark
the
village
of
bethany
a
pink
on
your
cheek
born
as
i
thought
of
the
excitement
of
being
among
those
tiny
photographs
of
the
wonderful
past
but
born
in
part
i
now
believe
of
the
fact
that
evan
roberts
joined
us
in
our
walk
oh
little
mousie
how
quiet
you
were
well
many
things
have
since
transpired
we
are
old
married
women
you
and
ruth
and
eurie
and
i
suppose
the
contrast
in
our
lives
the
outward
portion
of
them
i
mean
is
still
as
strongly
marked
perhaps
more
so
than
it
was
when
we
were
in
chautauqua
together
we
were
girls
then
we
are
matrons
now
and
with
the
taking
on
of
that
title
ruth
and
i
took
special
and
great
responsibilities
it
rains
dennis
has
been
called
to
the
upper
part
of
the
city
away
out
to
springdale
in
fact
to
see
a
sick
and
dying
man
and
i
am
alone
and
almost
lonely
if
i
could
summon
any
one
of
the
three
to
my
aid
and
comfort
i
would
i
am
almost
as
lonely
as
i
was
on
some
of
those
evenings
in
the
old
still
there
are
differences
the
smoky
old
stove
is
not
a
summer
warmth
floats
through
the
house
born
of
steam
no
kerosene
lamp
offends
your
aesthetic
friend
but
the
softest
of
shaded
sheds
a
halo
around
me
is
that
almost
poetic
moreover
oh
blessed
thought
i
have
no
examination
papers
to
prepare
no
reports
to
make
up
nothing
to
do
but
visit
with
you
also
i
will
admit
just
to
you
that
this
is
another
and
most
blessed
difference
between
this
and
my
lonely
past
at
almost
any
moment
now
i
may
hope
for
dennis
ring
and
when
he
comes
all
sense
of
loneliness
will
instantly
depart
ah
flossy
dear
flossy
this
is
such
a
difference
as
even
you
can
not
appreciate
you
had
your
mother
and
father
and
all
your
dear
home
friends
and
i
had
no
one
and
besides
here
i
hesitate
lest
you
may
be
too
obtuse
to
understand
the
reasoning
you
have
only
added
roberts
to
your
circle
of
treasures
he
is
grand
and
good
i
know
and
i
like
him
without
even
a
mental
reservation
but
my
dear
i
have
added
dennis
can
human
language
say
more
nonsense
aside
sweet
little
woman
god
has
been
very
good
to
you
and
me
yet
flossy
do
you
remember
how
during
those
last
months
in
which
we
were
together
i
fell
into
the
habit
of
telling
you
a
great
deal
about
the
thorns
and
admitted
to
you
once
that
they
pricked
less
when
they
had
felt
your
smoothing
touch
i
want
to
tell
you
something
our
gracie
i
am
so
sorry
for
her
yet
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
is
living
a
most
unhappy
life
and
of
course
she
shadows
our
lives
also
i
told
you
dear
about
ellis
he
is
still
trying
to
convince
poor
gracie
that
i
being
her
must
be
her
natural
enemy
reminding
her
that
before
i
came
into
the
family
her
father
was
entirely
willing
to
receive
his
calls
and
allowed
her
to
accept
his
attentions
do
you
see
it
is
strange
at
all
that
the
poor
little
girl
should
believe
him
and
turn
from
me
she
has
many
judicious
helpers
in
her
father
congregation
there
are
those
who
sigh
over
her
almost
in
my
hearing
gracie
they
say
changed
she
is
she
used
to
be
so
bright
and
happy
there
is
something
unnatural
in
these
relations
all
children
rebel
imagine
such
talk
helping
gracie
meantime
what
do
you
suppose
can
be
ellis
motive
i
can
not
think
that
he
cares
for
her
i
almost
do
not
believe
that
there
is
enough
purity
left
in
him
even
to
admire
a
young
girl
certainly
not
one
with
such
high
ideals
and
earnest
ambitions
as
gracie
had
does
she
admire
him
i
fancy
i
hear
you
asking
my
dear
she
does
she
thinks
she
does
and
at
seventeen
such
thoughts
sometimes
work
irreparable
mischief
but
left
alone
one
of
these
days
she
would
make
the
discovery
that
she
was
flattered
by
his
attentions
because
he
is
nearly
fifteen
years
older
than
she
and
is
brilliant
in
conversation
and
quoted
as
the
finest
musician
in
the
city
i
wish
i
knew
more
things
about
him
what
i
do
know
shows
me
plainly
enough
the
sort
of
man
he
is
but
with
these
guileless
young
things
it
seems
as
though
one
had
to
unmask
wickedness
very
thoroughly
before
they
will
believe
that
it
is
anything
but
gossip
or
misrepresentation
he
has
gone
away
for
a
six
weeks
vacation
i
do
know
where
nor
does
dennis
gracie
knows
but
does
not
enlighten
me
flossy
dear
could
you
give
me
a
little
wholesome
advice
do
you
think
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
i
was
not
too
complacent
over
my
proposed
duties
such
schemed
as
i
had
i
was
going
to
be
the
blessedest
that
girl
ever
had
that
would
not
be
saying
much
possibly
do
we
all
incline
to
think
that
the
second
mothers
must
be
wrong
and
the
sons
and
daughters
poor
abused
darlings
but
i
loved
gracie
you
know
and
she
seemed
to
love
me
and
to
be
so
happy
over
the
thought
of
our
near
relationship
there
is
very
little
happiness
from
any
such
source
during
these
days
gracie
has
retired
into
dignity
she
can
be
the
most
dignified
young
woman
on
occasion
that
i
ever
beheld
she
is
not
rude
to
me
on
the
contrary
she
is
ceremoniously
polite
calls
me
dennis
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
when
necessity
compels
her
to
call
me
anything
but
she
speaks
as
little
as
possible
sits
at
table
with
us
three
times
a
day
when
she
can
not
secure
an
excuse
for
absence
that
her
father
will
accept
says
sir
and
sir
obediently
to
him
and
thank
you
to
me
and
that
is
the
extent
of
our
conversation
generally
her
face
is
pale
and
her
eyes
red
and
at
the
first
possible
moment
she
begs
to
be
excused
and
retires
to
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
and
locks
her
door
her
father
has
stopped
her
music
lessons
at
least
she
preferred
to
have
them
stopped
rather
than
take
lessons
of
any
other
person
so
she
practices
no
more
she
continues
her
german
and
french
and
secures
good
reports
from
the
professors
but
there
is
an
air
of
weariness
and
dreariness
about
everything
she
does
that
makes
one
alternate
between
a
feeling
of
deep
pity
for
her
and
a
desire
to
box
her
ears
or
shut
her
up
in
a
corner
until
she
can
behave
herself
as
a
rule
however
i
am
sorry
for
her
i
was
young
once
myself
i
was
undisciplined
i
had
no
mother
and
i
had
a
thousand
wild
fancies
any
one
of
which
might
have
ruined
me
what
do
you
think
you
would
do
dear
if
roberts
had
a
daughter
and
you
were
her
mother
you
are
all
in
a
flush
now
and
have
lain
down
this
sheet
and
said
aloud
an
idea
marion
does
say
the
most
absurd
things
well
then
if
you
were
marion
dennis
and
stood
before
god
in
the
place
of
mother
to
grace
dennis
what
do
you
imagine
you
would
do
i
tell
you
my
policy
i
am
uniformly
cheerful
in
her
presence
gay
if
i
can
make
gayety
out
of
anything
not
toward
her
father
you
understand
because
i
can
fancy
that
might
irritate
her
i
really
try
to
be
gay
toward
gracie
herself
but
can
you
imagine
an
attempt
to
be
cheery
with
a
tombstone
i
study
as
much
as
i
can
her
tastes
in
the
ordering
of
dinner
and
desserts
and
arrange
the
flowers
that
i
know
she
likes
best
and
in
short
try
to
do
all
those
little
bits
of
nice
things
that
i
feel
certain
you
would
do
in
my
place
and
just
here
i
may
as
well
own
that
i
learned
these
small
prettinesses
studying
you
never
should
have
thought
them
out
for
myself
flossy
dennis
is
one
of
the
most
patient
and
of
men
but
it
is
very
hard
for
him
to
be
patient
with
poor
gracie
harder
than
it
is
for
me
first
because
i
know
by
personal
experience
just
what
a
turbulent
young
creature
a
miss
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
can
be
and
secondly
because
it
is
upon
me
her
displeasure
falls
most
heavily
and
that
naturally
he
resents
why
am
i
writing
all
this
to
you
i
do
know
childie
really
save
that
i
remember
what
a
curious
way
you
have
of
telling
jesus
all
about
your
friends
and
their
trials
and
i
remember
with
great
comfort
that
you
are
my
friend
do
imagine
me
as
miserable
i
can
never
be
that
so
long
as
christ
is
the
present
helper
that
he
is
to
me
now
and
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
i
daily
thank
him
for
giving
me
my
husband
but
i
think
you
will
understand
better
than
many
would
how
earnestly
i
desire
to
fill
the
place
of
mother
to
my
bright
young
motherless
gracie
with
her
dangerous
beauty
and
her
dangerous
talents
and
her
capacity
for
being
miserable
oh
i
want
to
do
more
than
my
duty
i
want
to
love
her
with
all
my
heart
and
to
have
her
love
me
if
it
were
not
for
that
man
who
always
hated
me
and
who
i
believe
in
my
heart
has
sought
her
out
and
is
pressing
his
attentions
upon
her
because
he
sees
a
possibility
of
stinging
me
through
her
i
might
hope
to
fill
the
place
in
her
heart
that
i
thought
i
the
letter
closed
abruptly
at
this
point
and
was
finished
a
few
days
afterwards
in
a
different
strain
giving
plenty
of
home
news
and
being
full
of
the
brightness
which
always
sparkled
in
marion
letters
but
it
was
the
first
two
or
three
pages
to
which
roberts
turned
back
and
which
she
thoughtfully
then
she
interrupted
the
busy
pen
evan
are
not
the
business
letters
nearly
done
i
want
to
read
this
to
you
and
then
i
want
to
talk
to
delightful
prospects
both
of
them
he
said
with
energy
as
he
added
the
last
hurried
line
signed
and
delivered
to
his
wife
to
enclose
in
its
envelope
then
pushed
aside
writing
materials
and
sat
back
to
enjoy
it
is
all
delightful
his
wife
said
shaking
her
head
i
did
hope
that
poor
marion
was
going
to
have
a
few
years
of
rest
her
life
has
been
such
a
hard
chapter
ix
tremendous
facts
he
said
it
is
well
that
marion
dennis
felt
entirely
safe
in
her
friend
flossy
hands
for
her
affairs
were
very
thoroughly
talked
over
that
evening
and
sundry
conclusions
arrived
at
one
question
roberts
asked
her
husband
at
the
close
of
the
conference
which
apparently
had
nothing
to
do
with
marion
affairs
evan
do
you
know
everett
everett
let
me
think
yes
i
know
of
him
a
young
physician
comparatively
who
had
not
been
here
long
and
has
made
his
in
what
direction
several
perhaps
but
i
have
heard
of
him
chiefly
in
the
line
of
his
profession
he
was
accidentally
called
to
attend
a
young
lady
belonging
to
a
very
wealthy
family
out
in
brookline
i
say
accidentally
that
is
a
reverent
way
we
have
of
speaking
you
know
of
course
i
mean
providentially
the
nursery
governess
in
the
family
was
sick
and
this
everett
who
had
fallen
in
with
her
somewhere
volunteered
to
cure
her
he
was
calling
on
her
one
morning
when
the
sick
daughter
who
by
the
way
had
been
given
up
by
her
physician
was
taken
suddenly
and
alarmingly
worse
in
the
emergency
everett
was
summoned
and
while
they
waited
for
the
regular
physician
he
succeeded
in
doing
such
good
service
that
he
inspired
the
mother
with
confidence
she
became
anxious
to
put
the
case
entirely
into
his
hands
which
was
done
and
the
young
lady
recovered
and
everett
position
professionally
was
assured
is
that
an
interesting
little
item
for
you
he
is
said
to
have
marked
success
and
of
course
since
the
brookline
occurrence
his
practice
is
largely
among
the
wealthy
how
has
your
attention
been
called
to
him
my
protector
this
morning
said
he
was
a
doctor
who
was
attending
that
calkins
boy
i
wondered
if
he
did
it
because
he
loved
christ
he
might
be
a
helper
i
want
to
call
on
that
sick
boy
if
i
can
arrange
it
i
think
i
must
take
some
one
with
you
may
take
me
with
you
her
husband
said
emphatically
however
much
trips
through
alleys
with
nimble
dick
might
be
conducive
to
that
young
man
moral
development
roberts
felt
that
his
wife
had
experimented
sufficiently
thus
it
transpired
that
dressed
in
the
plainest
quietest
garb
which
her
wardrobe
would
furnish
roberts
went
to
the
alley
the
next
morning
accompanied
by
her
husband
in
one
sense
it
was
a
mistake
that
the
first
call
in
the
alley
should
have
been
made
on
the
calkins
family
it
was
calculated
to
give
roberts
mistaken
ideas
as
to
the
manner
in
which
poor
people
lived
a
bare
enough
room
certainly
not
even
a
bit
of
carpet
laid
before
the
bed
but
it
was
a
clean
room
floor
and
window
and
were
as
clean
as
water
could
make
them
and
the
bed
while
it
looked
hopelessly
hard
and
dreadful
to
roberts
was
really
a
pattern
of
neatness
and
purity
to
every
dweller
in
that
attic
there
was
a
straw
tick
covered
with
a
dark
calico
spread
which
did
duty
as
a
sheet
and
the
boy
who
lay
on
it
was
covered
by
a
patched
quilt
that
had
been
mended
and
was
clean
wonderful
things
these
to
say
of
such
a
locality
roberts
suspected
it
and
everett
knew
it
that
gentleman
was
bending
over
his
patient
when
the
two
guests
arrived
and
vouchsafed
them
not
even
a
glance
while
the
homely
girl
gave
roberts
a
seat
on
the
one
chair
which
the
room
contained
and
set
a
stool
for
her
husband
that
had
been
made
of
four
old
chair
legs
and
a
square
board
sallie
calkins
was
somewhat
flurried
by
this
unexpected
call
she
had
no
idea
who
the
people
were
nor
for
what
they
had
come
a
vague
fear
that
they
might
be
in
some
way
connected
with
her
brother
place
at
the
which
he
was
in
such
fear
of
losing
that
his
night
had
been
a
restless
one
made
her
hasten
to
say
in
a
tremulous
voice
the
doctor
thinks
he
will
be
well
in
a
little
while
it
is
a
bad
break
he
says
and
mark
wants
to
keep
his
place
he
thinks
maybe
some
of
the
alley
boys
would
keep
it
for
him
if
you
would
be
so
she
was
evidently
addressing
roberts
but
she
looked
at
flossy
the
fair
sweet
face
that
gave
her
such
sympathetic
glances
seemed
the
one
to
appeal
to
roberts
however
discerned
that
he
was
mistaken
for
the
employer
and
immediately
dispelled
the
idea
by
asking
where
the
boy
worked
and
how
the
accident
had
happened
it
was
the
elevator
sir
she
said
eagerly
the
chain
broke
and
it
went
down
with
a
bang
and
mark
was
on
it
and
he
rolled
off
somehow
he
does
know
how
and
he
has
been
that
bad
that
he
could
tell
me
if
he
had
he
was
kind
of
wild
sir
all
night
and
talking
about
his
was
there
no
one
but
you
to
be
with
him
during
the
night
roberts
asked
where
is
the
mother
we
got
no
mother
there
is
only
mark
and
me
and
father
she
added
after
a
doubtful
pause
but
father
was
not
at
home
last
night
oh
i
did
need
no
one
to
take
care
of
mark
i
would
have
left
and
he
likes
to
have
you
take
care
of
him
i
am
sure
what
do
you
give
him
to
eat
he
will
need
nourishing
food
i
think
beef
teas
and
broths
and
nice
little
tempting
dishes
made
with
milk
perhaps
are
you
his
cook
too
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
have
me
show
you
how
to
make
good
things
for
him
i
learned
how
to
make
some
nice
dishes
that
sick
people
before
the
bewildered
girl
could
answer
the
doctor
turned
abruptly
from
his
long
examination
of
his
patient
and
gave
the
guests
the
first
attention
he
had
vouchsafed
them
the
truth
was
this
man
had
had
some
unfortunate
experiences
with
district
visitors
and
had
perhaps
an
unreasonable
prejudice
against
them
as
a
class
i
ca
help
it
he
said
to
saunders
when
she
was
taking
him
to
task
one
day
there
are
exceptions
of
course
at
least
we
will
hope
there
are
but
if
you
had
seen
some
of
my
specimens
you
would
be
the
first
to
wish
an
infusion
of
common
sense
could
be
introduced
among
them
as
a
rule
they
offer
a
tract
where
they
should
give
a
loaf
of
bread
or
a
bowl
of
broth
and
wedge
their
advice
and
reproofs
in
with
every
helpful
movement
it
is
like
so
many
doses
of
medicine
to
the
patient
to
be
endured
because
he
is
at
their
mercy
and
ca
help
himself
they
mean
well
the
most
of
them
but
the
trouble
is
we
have
a
way
of
making
district
visitors
out
of
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
and
who
have
never
learned
that
the
nations
of
the
earth
were
made
of
one
blood
something
in
roberts
tones
or
words
seemed
to
interest
him
and
he
turned
toward
her
does
this
alley
belong
to
you
he
asked
abruptly
his
mind
still
full
of
the
district
visitor
she
regarded
him
with
a
puzzled
air
for
a
moment
then
answered
naïvely
i
do
think
it
does
if
it
did
i
would
have
some
things
ever
so
everett
laughed
and
roberts
came
forward
and
introduced
himself
my
wife
has
hardly
answered
you
fully
he
said
i
am
under
the
impression
that
she
desires
to
adopt
a
certain
portion
of
this
alley
at
least
i
have
heard
of
little
else
since
last
sabbath
afternoon
she
is
in
search
of
some
stray
sheep
who
have
been
put
under
her
ah
the
doctor
said
turning
quickly
to
her
a
teacher
is
this
young
man
one
of
your
scholars
no
she
explained
but
she
had
heard
of
him
while
inquiring
where
one
of
her
boys
lived
and
she
had
called
to
see
if
she
could
help
in
any
way
dirk
colson
was
the
boy
who
they
told
her
lived
near
this
the
eyes
of
the
trim
sister
brightened
he
lives
on
the
next
square
she
said
oh
are
you
his
teacher
and
do
you
care
for
him
i
so
he
is
a
favorite
of
yours
is
he
the
doctor
asked
looking
from
one
speaking
face
to
another
and
seeming
immensely
interested
in
the
matter
no
indeed
the
girl
said
quickly
he
horrid
but
i
sorry
for
his
sister
and
she
wants
dirk
to
get
on
and
he
never
does
get
on
but
i
thought
maybe
such
a
kind
of
a
teacher
could
help
there
was
such
intense
and
genuine
admiration
in
the
girl
voice
for
the
vision
of
loveliness
before
her
that
everett
could
not
help
smiling
it
does
seem
unlikely
said
he
with
significance
and
added
who
is
this
dirk
colson
who
seems
to
be
an
object
of
interest
he
is
one
of
the
worst
boys
in
the
alley
sir
sometimes
i
think
he
is
the
very
worst
because
he
is
cross
as
well
as
hateful
but
mark
is
always
kind
of
sorry
for
him
and
says
he
has
such
a
bad
father
he
help
it
and
mart
that
his
sister
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
she
feels
bad
about
dirk
but
she
ca
do
nothing
he
ai
a
bit
like
mark
the
last
words
were
spoken
tenderly
and
the
sisterly
eyes
turned
toward
the
boy
on
the
bed
and
obeying
a
sign
from
his
eyes
she
went
over
to
him
the
doctor
plied
his
questions
have
you
recently
taken
a
class
madam
and
is
their
general
reputation
as
encouraging
as
this
special
scamp
of
whom
we
are
hearing
his
words
almost
jarred
on
roberts
she
had
already
prayed
enough
for
her
boys
to
have
a
sort
of
tender
feeling
for
them
a
half
desire
to
cover
their
faults
from
the
gaze
of
the
indifferent
world
did
everett
represent
the
indifferent
world
or
did
he
love
her
master
she
wished
she
knew
there
is
nothing
encouraging
about
them
she
said
with
grave
earnestness
save
the
facts
that
they
are
made
in
the
image
of
god
and
that
he
wants
them
to
from
the
power
of
satan
unto
god
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
an
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
a
rare
flash
of
intelligence
and
appreciation
greeted
her
now
from
those
fine
eyes
bent
so
scrutinizingly
on
her
tremendous
facts
he
said
glorious
possibilities
hath
said
it
i
claim
kinship
with
you
i
am
an
heir
of
the
same
he
held
a
hand
to
each
and
they
were
cordially
grasped
then
everett
proceeded
to
business
there
is
enough
to
do
he
said
everything
is
lacking
here
there
is
severe
poverty
united
to
the
most
scrupulous
tenderness
and
the
most
tender
love
on
the
part
of
this
brother
and
sister
i
stumbled
on
the
case
and
will
do
professionally
all
that
is
needed
and
i
have
a
friend
who
would
undoubtedly
come
to
the
rescue
but
she
is
crowded
just
now
i
shall
be
rejoiced
to
report
to
her
a
helper
do
you
know
joy
saunders
well
i
wish
you
did
she
is
one
whom
you
could
appreciate
she
is
young
though
and
without
a
husband
to
guard
her
and
there
are
some
places
to
which
she
can
not
has
she
learned
that
important
fact
asked
roberts
with
a
significant
smile
then
some
explanation
seemed
necessary
this
lady
he
said
tried
the
alley
alone
yesterday
and
lost
her
way
and
went
lower
down
quite
near
to
burk
street
i
and
what
happened
the
quick
question
and
the
doctor
tone
suggested
possibilities
not
pleasant
oh
she
met
one
of
her
new
recruits
as
hard
a
boy
so
one
of
the
policemen
on
this
beat
tells
me
as
there
is
in
the
row
and
pressed
him
into
service
to
escort
her
back
to
civilization
and
strange
to
say
the
fellow
did
it
without
placing
any
the
doctor
turned
on
the
small
lady
a
curious
glance
i
think
you
may
be
able
to
do
something
even
for
dirk
colson
he
said
do
you
know
him
he
laughed
over
the
eagerness
of
the
question
never
heard
of
him
before
i
was
only
thinking
of
our
description
of
his
awfulness
ah
whom
have
we
here
for
the
door
had
opened
abruptly
and
a
pair
of
great
blue
eyes
set
in
a
frame
of
tawny
hair
all
in
a
frizzle
had
peered
in
on
them
the
vision
was
clothed
in
garments
so
torn
the
wonder
was
that
they
stayed
on
at
all
and
there
was
a
general
look
of
abject
poverty
about
her
to
which
sallie
calkins
with
all
the
bareness
of
her
lot
was
a
stranger
she
stood
for
just
a
moment
as
if
transfixed
by
astonishment
at
the
unwonted
sight
in
the
room
then
turned
and
sped
away
as
swiftly
and
silently
as
she
had
come
that
is
dirk
sister
sallie
calkins
said
coming
forward
her
homely
face
aglow
with
shame
she
is
a
bad
girl
she
does
mean
to
be
but
she
has
a
dreadful
time
her
mother
is
sickly
and
has
to
go
out
washing
times
when
she
is
able
to
sit
up
and
there
be
days
when
she
ca
hold
up
her
head
and
the
father
is
bad
and
drinks
and
swears
and
sells
things
for
drink
till
there
ai
nothing
left
to
sell
and
mart
has
anything
to
mend
her
clothes
with
and
she
know
how
anyway
and
she
has
even
got
a
comb
to
comb
her
hair
with
her
father
he
took
it
to
sell
and
everything
there
is
horrid
and
dirk
he
it
was
strange
she
could
not
herself
account
for
it
but
with
every
added
word
of
misery
that
set
poor
dirk
colson
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
of
humanity
there
seemed
to
come
into
this
woman
heart
and
shine
in
her
face
an
assurance
that
he
was
to
be
a
chosen
vessel
unto
the
doctor
was
watching
her
again
curious
apparently
to
see
how
this
pitiful
appeal
for
forbearance
in
judging
of
poor
mart
affected
her
and
something
in
his
face
made
her
say
speaking
low
an
inheritance
among
them
which
are
amen
he
said
and
there
came
to
roberts
a
feeling
that
this
earnest
prayer
for
the
second
time
repeated
by
two
men
who
prayed
was
a
sort
of
seal
from
the
master
she
turned
away
from
both
gentlemen
then
the
tears
were
very
near
the
surface
she
must
do
something
to
tone
down
the
beating
of
her
heart
sallie
was
at
hand
and
she
went
with
her
to
another
corner
of
the
room
and
a
conversation
was
carried
on
scraps
of
which
floated
back
to
the
gentlemen
in
the
form
of
sheets
grape
jelly
mutton
broth
a
soft
pillow
and
the
like
i
feel
my
patient
growing
better
the
doctor
said
with
satisfaction
is
there
no
father
here
roberts
asked
the
doctor
shook
his
head
but
answered
there
is
the
most
pitiful
apology
for
a
father
that
i
ever
saw
a
mere
wreck
of
a
man
spends
his
time
in
a
sort
of
weak
drinking
if
i
may
coin
a
phrase
to
describe
him
he
actually
uses
no
energy
even
in
that
business
just
staggers
around
and
bemoans
his
lot
a
most
unfortunate
man
in
his
own
estimation
with
whom
the
world
through
no
fault
of
his
has
gone
wrong
he
is
never
downright
intoxicated
and
never
free
from
the
effects
of
liquor
he
is
much
like
a
wilted
leaf
in
the
hands
of
this
boy
and
girl
they
could
pitch
him
out
of
the
window
without
much
difficulty
and
if
the
fall
did
not
kill
him
he
would
shed
tears
and
say
it
was
a
hard
world
but
now
what
do
we
see
when
the
name
of
father
is
so
dishonored
made
a
wreck
as
it
were
why
the
order
of
nature
is
reversed
and
these
children
take
on
the
protective
they
are
father
and
mother
and
he
is
the
weak
sinning
child
the
way
that
that
boy
and
girl
have
worked
to
keep
their
miserable
father
from
starving
or
freezing
is
something
to
astonish
the
very
angels
they
shield
him
too
nobody
who
wants
to
reach
their
hearts
must
blame
him
they
are
a
study
as
different
from
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
alley
as
the
sky
is
different
from
that
down
there
it
is
a
good
simile
either
there
is
no
religion
in
their
efforts
they
are
the
veriest
how
do
you
account
for
the
development
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
do
account
for
it
it
is
abnormal
there
must
have
been
a
mother
who
left
her
impress
i
ca
learn
anything
about
the
mother
she
died
when
the
girl
was
an
infant
but
i
would
like
to
know
her
history
i
venture
to
assert
that
she
belonged
to
christ
and
that
a
gleam
of
the
divine
pity
that
she
saw
in
him
and
loved
left
its
impress
on
her
children
that
is
somewhat
mystical
he
added
smiling
i
rarely
talk
in
this
way
it
must
have
been
your
wife
who
set
me
but
she
is
the
most
practical
and
energetic
of
beings
ay
so
are
the
angels
i
fancy
and
make
us
think
of
heaven
directly
we
hear
the
rustle
of
their
wings
has
your
wife
been
a
christian
long
barely
two
years
since
she
began
to
think
of
these
i
thought
as
much
she
impresses
me
as
one
who
is
being
led
who
does
not
choose
to
go
alone
has
not
learned
how
indeed
a
very
few
christians
never
learn
how
and
with
them
the
lord
does
his
special
work
well
sir
i
must
go
i
glad
to
have
met
you
and
glad
to
leave
you
here
good
morning
chapter
x
and
she
always
other
business
was
transacted
that
morning
which
brought
results
a
curious
habit
of
roberts
one
which
perhaps
most
strongly
marked
the
difference
between
her
ways
of
working
and
those
of
other
people
was
that
of
appealing
to
the
person
at
hand
for
information
on
any
subject
which
chanced
to
be
the
one
prominent
in
her
mind
at
the
time
where
other
and
more
systematic
persons
would
have
said
he
is
not
the
one
to
ask
about
this
matter
there
is
no
reason
for
supposing
that
he
has
any
knowledge
in
this
direction
roberts
would
say
i
can
not
be
sure
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
give
just
the
information
which
i
need
in
any
case
what
harm
will
it
do
to
try
and
she
always
tried
it
was
on
this
principle
that
she
arrested
everett
speedy
departure
with
a
question
dr
everett
are
you
familiar
with
for
young
men
something
like
a
vision
swept
instantly
before
the
doctor
in
which
he
saw
the
long
line
of
young
men
and
the
long
line
of
in
the
world
and
he
laughed
with
eyes
and
lips
the
question
seemed
so
queerly
put
with
how
many
of
them
madam
there
was
amusement
in
his
voice
but
there
was
also
curiosity
he
wanted
to
know
what
this
original
little
lady
was
in
search
of
one
would
do
if
it
were
of
just
the
right
stamp
i
tell
you
what
i
want
a
nice
quiet
comfortable
sort
of
place
with
a
small
room
capable
of
being
warmed
a
single
bedstead
with
a
passably
good
bed
and
a
moderate
rate
of
board
are
not
those
modest
enough
requirements
not
at
all
they
are
preposterous
a
to
which
one
could
conveniently
apply
the
word
in
a
young
man
room
he
is
expected
to
enjoy
freezing
in
a
city
and
if
he
come
from
the
country
he
should
be
grateful
for
the
privilege
but
the
idea
of
calling
for
a
good
bed
that
is
the
wildest
suggestion
of
all
has
she
ever
boarded
roberts
not
at
a
at
least
said
that
gentleman
enjoying
the
fun
but
roberts
looked
grave
are
you
serious
she
asked
gently
is
there
no
chance
in
this
great
city
for
a
christian
young
man
to
have
the
ordinary
comforts
of
common
life
just
a
little
quiet
room
where
he
can
pray
and
where
he
can
invite
some
tempted
soul
and
try
to
help
him
does
it
seem
all
wrong
the
laugh
was
gone
from
the
doctor
face
there
was
a
look
of
keen
interest
and
genuine
respect
how
many
young
men
are
you
thinking
about
there
are
many
christians
i
believe
among
that
class
poor
young
men
away
from
home
and
i
have
reason
to
fear
that
their
chances
for
comfortable
retirement
are
very
scarce
i
have
thought
about
the
problem
somewhat
how
to
help
them
in
the
concrete
i
do
see
the
way
of
how
many
are
you
thinking
i
am
willing
to
think
about
them
all
roberts
said
and
now
it
was
her
turn
to
laugh
but
i
am
panning
for
just
one
i
can
not
work
in
great
ways
but
i
thought
i
might
help
exactly
roberts
if
every
christian
in
our
city
would
undertake
to
help
the
problem
would
be
solved
well
there
is
one
to
which
the
word
may
properly
be
applied
and
there
is
one
small
room
on
the
third
floor
vacated
yesterday
i
wonder
if
the
master
wants
it
for
your
young
man
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
any
one
thing
more
than
another
that
we
need
in
that
house
just
now
it
is
a
christian
young
man
of
what
type
is
your
friend
will
he
help
or
hinder
a
gay
young
scamp
much
sought
after
by
satan
he
will
try
hard
to
help
said
both
and
roberts
and
before
they
parted
the
doctor
had
taken
ried
address
and
promised
to
call
on
him
and
negotiate
the
matter
that
plan
will
work
in
two
ways
said
roberts
gleefully
mr
ried
will
be
in
the
same
home
with
and
somewhat
under
the
influence
of
that
grand
doctor
is
it
splendid
that
we
asked
just
him
and
her
husband
smilingly
assented
and
added
that
he
should
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
asking
him
on
her
way
down
town
roberts
had
dropped
a
letter
in
the
mail
which
also
brought
results
it
read
thus
dear
marion
i
have
time
for
but
a
line
for
i
want
to
catch
the
morning
mail
i
have
such
a
nice
plan
suppose
you
let
your
gracie
come
and
stay
with
me
for
a
few
weeks
you
know
she
always
liked
me
a
little
and
evan
and
i
think
we
can
make
it
pleasant
for
her
i
will
try
to
get
her
so
much
interested
in
seven
boys
whom
i
know
that
she
will
forget
all
about
professor
ellis
barnwell
a
confidential
clerk
in
the
store
old
and
will
go
to
transact
some
business
with
papa
evan
will
give
him
a
letter
of
introduction
to
dennis
he
expects
to
return
on
saturday
and
if
you
will
trust
gracie
to
us
and
she
is
willing
to
come
she
might
travel
in
barnwell
care
and
we
would
meet
her
at
the
depot
dear
marion
we
should
like
it
ever
so
much
and
i
have
prayed
about
it
all
the
morning
and
can
not
help
thinking
that
jesus
likes
it
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
when
roberts
took
her
seat
on
the
next
sabbath
afternoon
before
her
seven
boys
at
the
south
end
mission
a
vision
of
loveliness
such
as
the
mission
had
not
often
seen
came
in
with
her
and
looked
with
eyes
on
all
the
new
and
strange
sights
and
sounds
about
her
a
very
pretty
creature
was
gracie
dennis
her
eyes
had
lost
none
of
their
brightness
although
they
had
shed
some
tears
during
her
recent
experiences
they
were
fairly
sparkling
for
the
great
city
into
which
she
had
come
for
the
first
time
was
like
fairyland
to
her
albeit
she
had
passed
through
scenes
that
afternoon
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
her
idea
of
fairyland
what
the
boys
thought
of
her
could
only
be
determined
from
their
stares
let
us
hope
that
her
presence
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
conduct
for
never
in
all
the
annals
of
the
south
end
mission
had
seven
boys
comported
themselves
as
did
those
before
whom
roberts
sat
that
winter
afternoon
nimble
dick
as
if
to
be
revenged
for
his
unintentional
courtesy
of
the
monday
before
placed
his
feet
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
in
alarming
proximity
to
roberts
shoulders
and
chewed
his
tobacco
and
defiled
the
floor
with
its
juice
and
talked
aloud
and
was
in
every
sense
disgusting
neither
was
dirk
colson
one
whit
behind
him
the
spirit
of
entertainment
was
upon
him
he
mimicked
durant
somewhat
hoarse
tones
exaggerating
the
imitation
of
course
until
it
was
ludicrous
he
imitated
the
somewhat
shrill
tenor
and
the
nasal
tones
of
deacon
carter
who
was
doing
good
work
with
a
class
of
women
he
even
imitated
roberts
soft
low
voice
as
she
essayed
to
interest
them
in
moses
and
some
of
the
wonders
which
he
performed
vain
hope
struggle
as
she
might
to
be
intensely
dramatic
in
her
narrative
she
did
not
for
a
moment
gain
the
ascendency
moses
interrupted
nimble
dick
in
the
very
midst
of
one
of
her
most
earnest
sentences
let
see
that
was
the
old
fellow
who
swallowed
the
serpents
was
it
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
been
used
you
do
know
nothin
interrupted
stephen
crowley
with
a
nudge
at
dirk
that
the
latter
pretended
tipped
him
entirely
off
the
seat
and
left
him
a
limp
heap
at
robert
feet
he
do
know
nothin
repeated
stephen
addressing
roberts
in
a
confidential
tone
was
the
serpents
swallowed
moses
was
it
question
is
how
did
he
get
around
again
quit
that
came
at
this
point
from
dirk
colson
in
his
fiercest
tone
look
here
you
bill
snyder
if
you
try
pinching
on
me
again
i
pitch
you
over
the
head
of
old
durant
in
less
than
a
second
what
was
the
poor
pale
little
woman
to
do
with
one
boy
crawling
about
the
floor
and
two
others
in
a
fight
with
the
rest
in
a
giggle
of
what
use
to
try
to
talk
to
them
about
moses
you
should
have
seen
gracie
dennis
eyes
by
that
time
horror
and
disgust
were
about
equally
expressed
and
rising
above
them
both
a
look
of
actual
fear
durant
came
over
to
attempt
a
rescue
his
face
distressed
beyond
measure
mrs
roberts
this
is
too
much
i
am
sure
that
patience
has
ceased
to
be
a
virtue
they
have
never
gone
so
far
before
i
suspected
mischief
i
have
heard
from
several
of
them
during
the
week
and
never
anything
but
evil
i
am
prepared
for
it
there
is
a
full
police
force
on
guard
in
the
next
room
what
i
propose
is
to
have
every
one
of
these
fellows
taken
to
the
it
will
be
a
lesson
that
they
richly
deserve
and
may
do
them
whispering
was
not
one
of
durant
strong
points
he
meant
to
convey
secret
intelligence
of
plans
to
roberts
alone
in
reality
not
a
boy
in
the
class
but
heard
every
word
they
were
startled
into
silence
a
full
police
force
they
were
not
fonder
of
the
than
are
most
boys
who
deserve
that
punishment
they
were
skilful
in
escaping
the
hands
of
policemen
they
had
not
believed
that
the
south
end
mission
would
resort
to
any
such
means
they
recognized
in
the
mission
an
attempt
to
do
them
good
and
without
any
effort
at
reasoning
it
out
they
had
by
tacit
consent
decided
that
policemen
and
and
christian
effort
did
not
match
they
had
chuckled
much
over
the
stationing
of
little
duffer
at
the
door
on
guard
any
two
of
the
strong
young
fellows
were
a
match
for
him
and
in
the
event
of
a
riot
which
they
would
like
no
better
fun
than
to
help
get
up
how
many
choice
spirits
all
about
the
room
would
join
them
if
given
the
word
and
in
the
delightful
confusion
which
would
result
how
easy
to
escape
from
sight
and
hearing
while
policeman
duffer
was
summoning
aid
they
had
felt
comparatively
safe
but
a
full
police
force
detailed
for
duty
was
quite
another
thing
they
felt
caught
in
a
trap
nimble
dick
got
up
in
haste
from
the
floor
and
took
his
seat
and
the
boys
looked
from
one
to
another
with
ominous
frowns
there
were
reasons
why
none
of
them
cared
to
come
before
the
police
court
just
now
what
was
to
be
done
while
they
waited
and
considered
roberts
did
it
her
hand
was
on
durant
arm
and
directly
the
loud
whispering
ceased
she
spoke
in
low
but
distinctly
emphatic
tones
i
beg
of
you
durant
do
no
such
thing
i
would
dismiss
every
policeman
at
once
with
thanks
if
i
were
you
we
shall
not
need
their
help
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
the
boys
will
be
quiet
during
the
rest
of
the
session
not
because
they
are
afraid
of
policemen
but
because
they
respect
me
and
do
not
want
to
see
me
frightened
or
annoyed
please
do
let
a
policeman
come
near
i
am
not
sure
which
was
the
more
astonished
the
superintendent
or
the
boys
he
returned
to
his
desk
with
the
bewildered
air
of
one
whose
schemes
had
come
to
naught
in
an
unexpected
manner
without
giving
him
time
to
rally
and
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
in
perplexity
and
were
silent
roberts
turned
to
them
with
quiet
voice
boys
she
said
you
have
spoiled
the
story
that
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
have
lost
my
place
and
there
is
time
to
go
back
and
find
it
i
am
sorry
for
i
think
you
would
have
liked
the
story
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
this
week
trying
to
make
it
interesting
but
never
mind
now
there
is
something
else
i
want
to
say
will
you
spend
the
hours
from
eight
to
ten
with
me
evening
at
my
house
i
brought
cards
with
me
for
each
of
you
containing
my
address
that
you
might
have
no
trouble
in
finding
the
whereupon
she
produced
the
delicate
bits
of
pasteboard
with
her
name
and
address
handsomely
engraved
thereon
nimble
dick
took
his
between
his
soiled
thumb
and
finger
turned
it
over
in
a
pretence
of
great
interest
and
finally
endeavored
to
sight
it
with
his
eye
as
a
workman
does
his
board
what
you
do
with
us
if
we
come
stephen
crowley
asked
fixing
what
was
intended
as
a
wise
look
upon
her
the
leer
in
his
eye
hinting
that
he
was
smart
enough
to
see
another
trap
and
meant
not
to
fall
into
it
roberts
laughed
pleasantly
it
is
an
unusual
question
when
one
invites
company
she
said
but
i
do
mind
answering
it
for
one
thing
i
thought
we
would
have
an
oyster
stew
and
some
good
coffee
together
then
if
any
of
you
like
music
i
have
a
friend
with
me
who
is
a
good
singer
and
i
have
a
few
pictures
i
should
like
you
to
see
if
you
cared
to
and
i
do
know
whether
you
are
fond
of
flowers
but
some
of
you
may
have
a
mother
or
sister
at
home
who
is
and
the
greenhouse
is
all
aglow
just
now
oh
how
can
i
tell
what
i
should
do
to
entertain
guests
just
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
pleasant
at
the
time
that
is
the
way
i
generally
do
may
i
expect
you
the
boys
stared
this
was
a
new
departure
indeed
how
much
of
it
did
she
mean
what
was
she
trying
to
do
was
it
a
trap
still
she
had
rescued
them
from
the
police
force
and
they
had
not
expected
that
for
every
boy
of
them
knew
that
he
had
treated
her
shamefully
timothy
haskell
was
generally
the
quietest
one
of
the
group
and
perhaps
the
most
straightforward
he
went
directly
to
the
point
of
the
question
that
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of
the
others
what
do
you
do
it
for
yes
that
the
talk
said
nimble
dick
what
do
you
want
of
us
why
i
want
you
to
spend
the
evening
with
me
did
i
tell
you
if
you
really
mean
to
be
friends
with
me
of
course
i
must
invite
you
to
my
home
what
i
want
except
to
have
a
nice
time
i
trying
to
make
you
like
me
of
course
i
want
you
to
like
me
how
can
we
have
pleasant
times
together
unless
you
do
chapter
xi
i
have
but
to
try
again
pleasant
times
like
we
been
having
said
nimble
dick
with
a
wicked
leer
if
he
meant
to
disconcert
her
he
missed
his
point
no
she
said
promptly
we
have
had
a
bit
nice
times
and
as
for
liking
you
i
have
done
so
at
all
if
i
had
the
least
idea
that
you
meant
often
to
treat
me
as
you
have
this
afternoon
i
should
know
it
was
of
no
use
but
i
can
not
think
that
you
will
continue
to
treat
a
lady
in
such
a
manner
particularly
when
i
am
really
trying
to
make
a
pleasant
time
for
you
there
is
no
object
you
see
in
spoiling
this
plain
bit
of
truth
for
the
time
being
so
commended
itself
to
the
judgment
of
the
boys
that
they
regarded
the
speaker
gravely
without
attempting
a
reply
she
was
not
moralizing
at
least
it
was
unlike
any
moralizing
that
they
had
ever
heard
it
seemed
to
be
simply
a
bit
of
practical
common
sense
not
a
boy
would
have
owned
it
but
each
felt
just
at
that
moment
a
faint
hope
that
she
would
decide
it
was
of
no
use
and
give
them
up
straightforward
tim
haskell
had
one
more
question
to
ask
why
did
you
let
them
bring
in
their
police
and
settle
us
their
teacher
hesitated
just
a
moment
would
the
whole
truth
do
to
speak
in
this
case
could
she
hope
to
make
them
understand
that
she
saw
in
it
a
step
lower
down
and
that
thus
degraded
before
her
eyes
she
feared
her
possible
hold
on
them
would
be
gone
forever
no
it
do
a
little
a
little
piece
of
the
truth
was
all
that
she
could
treat
them
to
a
faint
sparkle
in
her
bright
eyes
which
every
one
of
them
saw
and
she
said
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
be
excused
in
time
to
keep
your
engagement
with
me
they
all
laughed
not
boisterously
actually
an
appreciative
laugh
they
were
bright
there
is
hardly
a
street
boy
living
by
his
wits
who
is
they
recognized
the
humor
hidden
in
the
answer
and
enjoyed
it
then
the
superintendent
bell
rang
that
bell
always
did
seem
to
have
an
evil
influence
on
those
boys
indeed
roberts
was
known
to
remark
a
few
sundays
afterwards
that
if
there
no
opening
and
closing
exercises
in
the
her
work
would
be
easier
that
street
boys
did
not
seem
to
have
one
element
of
devotion
in
them
and
needed
to
be
kept
at
high
pressure
in
order
to
be
able
to
control
themselves
the
thought
is
worthy
of
study
perhaps
it
is
just
possible
that
our
opening
and
closing
exercises
are
too
long
drawn
out
even
for
those
who
are
not
street
boys
be
that
as
it
may
the
little
spell
which
roberts
had
been
able
for
a
few
minutes
to
weave
around
her
boys
on
this
particular
sabbath
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
the
boys
returned
to
their
memories
of
insult
as
they
regarded
the
police
force
they
muttered
sullenly
among
themselves
about
traps
and
sells
and
guessed
they
would
get
caught
here
again
and
roberts
seeming
not
to
hear
heard
with
a
heavy
heart
how
angry
they
looked
even
nimble
dick
usually
merry
face
was
clouded
over
what
a
curious
thing
it
was
that
even
they
had
their
ideas
of
propriety
and
felt
themselves
insulted
was
it
an
instinct
she
wondered
a
reminder
that
there
was
in
them
material
for
manhood
would
they
ever
any
of
them
be
men
christian
gentlemen
it
seemed
almost
too
great
a
stretch
for
even
her
imagination
as
she
moved
in
her
seat
her
perfumed
handkerchief
fell
to
the
floor
roberts
was
used
to
young
men
mere
boys
even
whose
instinctive
movement
would
be
to
instantly
restore
it
to
her
not
a
boy
before
her
thought
of
such
a
thing
she
had
not
expected
it
of
course
yet
she
wondered
if
the
instinct
were
not
dormant
needing
but
the
suggestion
it
was
a
queer
little
notion
worthy
of
flossy
shipley
herself
who
from
being
continually
busy
about
little
things
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
anywhere
was
little
that
the
trifles
which
make
up
many
lives
had
much
to
do
with
the
happiness
of
other
lives
was
it
worth
her
while
to
try
to
teach
these
street
arabs
to
pick
up
fallen
handkerchiefs
she
differed
from
many
christian
workers
in
that
in
her
simplicity
she
really
thought
it
was
there
was
a
lull
just
at
that
moment
a
hymn
had
been
announced
but
the
organist
had
been
mislaid
and
was
being
sought
after
it
could
disturb
no
one
if
roberts
tried
her
little
experiment
she
looked
longingly
at
dirk
colson
but
his
brows
were
black
and
his
eyes
fierce
this
was
no
time
to
reach
him
nimble
dick
looked
much
more
approachable
she
determined
to
venture
him
mr
bolton
spoken
in
her
sweetest
voice
i
have
dropped
my
anybody
with
half
an
eye
could
see
that
mum
and
a
mighty
dirty
spot
you
picked
out
for
such
a
nice
little
rag
to
lie
this
was
her
only
response
then
the
discomfited
experimenter
told
herself
that
she
was
a
blunderer
how
could
the
poor
fellow
be
expected
to
know
what
she
meant
why
had
she
not
the
service
from
him
she
would
try
again
would
he
be
kind
enough
to
pick
it
up
for
her
it
was
long
afterwards
before
roberts
could
think
of
his
answer
without
a
sinking
heart
fixing
bold
saucy
eyes
on
her
he
spoke
in
deliberate
tones
loud
enough
to
be
heard
across
the
room
why
pick
it
up
yourself
mum
it
is
as
near
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
and
you
do
look
she
picked
it
up
her
poor
cheeks
burning
but
she
did
not
forget
it
various
conferences
told
their
different
stories
well
durant
said
stopping
in
the
act
of
mopping
his
hot
forehead
to
shake
hands
with
her
mrs
roberts
i
honor
your
courage
those
boys
were
simply
fearful
i
really
feared
some
outbreak
that
would
be
hard
to
quell
i
afraid
we
shall
have
to
give
them
up
yes
i
know
how
you
feel
but
you
have
been
here
to
see
what
we
have
borne
from
them
all
sorts
of
teachers
have
been
tried
we
have
given
them
the
best
material
we
had
both
men
and
women
and
every
one
has
failed
then
you
actually
want
to
try
it
for
another
sabbath
well
i
glad
of
it
oh
do
want
to
give
them
up
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
think
of
it
but
if
we
ca
keep
them
in
sufficient
order
to
get
any
benefit
nor
find
a
teacher
who
is
willing
to
hold
on
to
them
what
else
is
there
for
us
to
do
but
that
last
complaint
i
need
make
so
long
as
you
on
need
i
this
last
with
a
genial
smile
well
god
bless
you
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
hope
you
will
but
his
face
said
however
i
know
you
he
turned
from
her
and
said
as
much
to
young
ried
she
is
in
earnest
ried
and
she
has
resources
but
she
wo
catch
them
simply
because
they
do
mean
to
be
caught
they
come
here
to
make
trouble
and
for
nothing
else
just
look
at
the
way
they
have
performed
worse
than
ever
and
they
never
had
a
better
teacher
i
watched
her
and
i
believe
she
knows
how
i
tell
you
what
it
is
ried
we
must
hold
on
to
her
and
when
she
gives
up
those
boys
we
must
secure
her
for
that
class
of
girls
down
by
the
door
i
really
think
we
have
a
now
if
he
had
but
known
it
evan
roberts
meant
to
teach
no
other
class
at
the
south
end
mission
save
those
boys
flossy
shipley
this
was
gracie
dennis
exclamation
when
she
was
very
much
excited
she
went
back
to
the
old
name
what
you
trying
to
do
with
those
horrid
boys
and
how
can
you
endure
their
impudence
i
never
saw
anything
like
their
actions
in
my
life
and
i
thought
i
had
seen
bad
boys
you
look
completely
worn
out
and
no
wonder
i
think
roberts
would
let
you
do
this
what
good
can
you
do
such
creatures
flossy
my
dear
gracie
do
you
think
that
jesus
christ
died
to
save
them
well
said
gracie
hesitatingly
it
was
a
favorite
phrase
with
her
as
it
is
with
many
people
when
they
do
know
what
to
say
next
and
do
you
think
he
wants
them
saved
and
will
he
not
be
pleased
with
even
my
little
bits
of
efforts
if
he
knows
that
my
sincere
desire
is
to
save
these
souls
for
his
glory
but
what
i
mean
is
what
good
can
you
do
them
so
long
as
they
act
as
they
do
now
they
did
listen
to
a
word
you
said
so
as
to
get
any
good
out
of
i
do
know
that
dear
nor
do
you
do
you
think
the
holy
spirit
sometimes
presses
words
on
people
that
they
do
not
seem
to
be
heeding
in
any
event
that
is
a
part
with
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
i
tried
and
if
i
failed
utterly
i
have
but
to
try
again
it
is
as
though
there
were
some
good
teacher
ready
to
take
them
nobody
will
make
a
second
effort
now
there
is
one
thing
i
can
certainly
do
i
can
keep
on
making
efforts
who
knows
but
some
of
them
may
bear
fruit
by
the
way
gracie
i
want
ever
so
much
of
your
mine
said
gracie
with
eyes
i
do
know
how
to
help
people
i
not
and
her
face
darkened
in
a
frown
some
unpleasant
memories
that
went
far
toward
proving
the
truth
of
that
statement
coming
to
mind
just
then
after
a
moment
she
spoke
in
a
somewhat
more
gentle
tone
do
count
on
me
flossy
for
help
about
those
boys
they
frighten
me
i
never
saw
such
fellows
i
could
help
wondering
what
papa
would
have
said
to
between
the
wondering
and
the
noun
there
had
been
an
observable
pause
roberts
suspected
that
the
thought
in
gracie
mind
was
rather
what
dennis
who
was
supposed
to
have
much
knowledge
of
boys
would
have
thought
of
them
but
since
her
arrival
gracie
had
studiously
avoided
any
reference
to
her
stepmother
and
roberts
had
humored
her
folly
never
mind
you
can
help
them
and
when
you
begin
to
realize
that
you
will
forget
your
do
you
expect
to
see
one
of
the
creatures
evening
what
in
the
world
would
you
do
with
them
if
they
did
come
i
not
sure
that
i
them
i
only
hope
for
them
as
to
what
to
do
with
them
i
trust
to
you
to
help
answer
that
question
i
want
to
give
them
an
idea
of
what
a
nice
time
i
can
not
help
said
gracie
again
but
she
was
and
referred
again
and
again
to
the
subject
roberts
as
to
her
plans
and
hopes
until
that
lady
gave
a
satisfied
smile
to
the
thought
that
her
seven
boys
had
begun
their
work
the
first
part
of
this
conversation
was
held
while
they
waited
in
one
of
the
for
ried
to
give
in
his
report
before
joining
them
the
waiting
suggested
to
gracie
another
question
who
is
this
ried
who
seems
to
have
us
in
charge
he
is
one
of
the
clerks
from
the
store
which
accounts
in
part
for
his
attendance
on
us
but
i
am
interested
in
him
for
other
reasons
he
had
a
wonderful
sister
that
is
she
was
a
wonderful
christian
she
died
when
quite
young
but
one
might
be
ready
to
go
to
heaven
early
if
one
had
accomplished
as
much
as
she
did
by
one
of
those
strange
arrangements
which
i
should
think
would
go
far
toward
making
observing
people
believe
in
a
special
providence
her
life
or
i
might
almost
say
her
death
was
the
means
of
changing
the
current
of
my
husband
life
he
says
he
was
a
gay
young
fellow
a
member
of
the
church
but
giving
just
as
little
attention
to
religion
as
many
do
whom
you
and
i
know
an
accident
to
one
of
his
family
held
him
for
several
weeks
in
the
town
where
this
ester
ried
lived
and
her
physician
with
whom
he
became
acquainted
introduced
him
to
her
it
seems
she
was
very
much
interested
in
young
men
in
their
christian
development
he
went
to
see
her
several
times
and
to
use
his
own
expression
she
first
made
him
realize
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
zeal
and
then
she
set
it
on
fire
what
she
had
begun
in
life
she
finished
in
her
death
evan
attended
her
funeral
services
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
bible
texts
of
her
selection
the
most
wonderful
texts
all
about
christian
work
and
about
being
in
earnest
because
the
time
was
short
evan
says
he
began
to
understand
then
that
the
service
of
christ
was
first
best
and
always
was
it
a
singular
providence
that
led
him
under
the
influence
of
that
young
girl
during
the
closing
weeks
of
her
life
only
think
he
has
been
doing
her
work
ever
since
doing
it
possibly
in
ways
that
she
could
not
compass
that
is
one
reason
why
i
am
so
much
interested
in
those
boys
it
seems
to
me
as
though
they
were
her
boys
did
i
tell
you
that
her
heart
went
out
especially
after
the
neglected
i
learned
about
the
boys
through
ried
he
was
but
a
child
when
his
sister
died
and
yet
she
succeeded
in
so
enthusing
him
with
her
ideas
that
he
is
all
the
time
trying
to
carry
out
her
plans
she
had
some
wonderful
ones
this
idea
of
inviting
the
boys
socially
i
had
from
her
do
you
see
how
plainly
she
is
working
yet
though
she
has
been
in
heaven
so
long
do
you
think
asked
gracie
dennis
a
timid
gentle
sound
to
her
voice
that
all
christians
ought
to
put
religion
best
and
always
as
your
husband
said
i
fancied
that
some
were
set
apart
to
do
a
special
we
are
all
set
apart
dear
do
you
think
given
to
him
to
use
as
he
will
the
trouble
is
that
so
many
of
us
take
back
the
gifts
and
use
our
time
and
our
tongues
as
though
they
were
our
our
repeated
gracie
amazement
in
her
voice
why
yes
did
you
give
him
your
tongue
when
you
gave
him
yourself
and
yet
you
are
fortunate
if
you
have
not
dishonored
him
with
it
many
a
said
gracie
what
a
queer
way
you
have
of
putting
then
came
alfred
ried
in
haste
and
apologizing
for
the
long
delay
gracie
dennis
watched
him
curiously
listened
critically
to
his
words
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
this
young
man
put
religion
first
best
and
always
and
considered
his
tongue
as
given
to
the
lord
alfred
bore
the
scrutiny
well
he
took
very
little
notice
of
miss
gracie
being
entirely
absorbed
with
another
matter
he
had
settled
opinions
about
roberts
now
from
which
he
would
not
be
likely
to
waver
he
had
seen
much
of
her
during
the
week
and
he
knew
she
had
not
been
idle
she
had
given
him
much
valuable
information
concerning
the
boys
in
whom
he
had
been
interested
all
winter
and
whom
she
had
known
for
a
week
also
he
was
aware
that
sally
and
mark
calkins
had
seen
much
of
her
to
their
great
benefit
she
had
made
him
her
messenger
on
one
occasion
and
he
had
seen
sally
calkins
take
from
the
basket
the
clean
sheets
that
were
to
freshen
her
brother
bed
and
bestow
on
them
rapturous
kisses
while
she
murmured
i
walk
on
my
knees
in
broad
daylight
through
the
gutter
to
serve
her
that
i
sheets
are
much
i
suppose
moralized
the
young
man
as
he
walked
thoughtfully
homeward
people
with
much
less
money
than
she
has
must
have
furnished
them
it
is
thinking
about
things
that
makes
the
difference
between
her
and
but
he
had
not
quite
found
the
secret
the
main
difference
between
her
and
many
other
people
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
set
steadily
about
doing
the
things
she
thought
of
that
would
be
nice
to
do
on
the
whole
young
ried
was
fully
prepared
to
sympathize
with
durant
opinion
that
the
south
end
mission
had
secured
a
prize
not
that
he
was
very
hopeful
over
those
boys
he
felt
that
their
conduct
under
the
circumstances
showed
a
depth
of
depravity
which
was
beyond
the
reach
of
mission
schools
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
think
that
good
things
were
arranged
for
them
if
they
had
but
chosen
to
receive
he
began
at
once
to
talk
about
them
mrs
roberts
they
are
worse
than
i
had
supposed
i
am
afraid
that
your
patience
is
her
answer
was
peculiar
mr
ried
i
want
you
to
spend
evening
with
me
i
have
invited
my
boys
and
i
depend
on
you
and
gracie
here
to
help
entertain
are
you
equal
to
such
formidable
work
as
that
asked
gracie
with
a
mischievous
smile
he
did
not
respond
to
the
smile
he
was
looking
at
roberts
studying
her
face
as
one
bewildered
with
the
rapidity
of
her
moves
i
want
to
be
he
said
with
feeling
i
want
to
know
how
to
work
and
i
learning
roberts
i
moved
to
my
new
last
evening
and
my
room
is
a
perfect
little
gem
there
is
an
illuminated
text
in
it
and
all
around
it
is
twined
an
ivy
growing
do
you
think
hidden
you
know
behind
the
frame
in
a
bottle
and
the
text
is
one
of
my
sister
treasures
is
that
a
singular
coincidence
it
is
very
nice
said
roberts
with
satisfied
eyes
she
still
made
much
use
of
that
little
word
and
roberts
i
asked
one
of
your
boys
to
come
in
this
evening
and
see
my
chapter
xii
i
want
them
to
get
used
to
those
two
people
can
think
and
talk
of
nothing
but
those
dreadful
boys
said
gracie
to
herself
half
annoyed
and
wholly
interested
she
found
herself
that
very
evening
turning
over
the
music
with
the
wonderment
in
her
mind
as
to
what
she
could
sing
that
they
would
be
likely
to
care
for
provided
one
of
them
appeared
which
thing
she
did
not
expect
but
i
have
not
told
you
of
all
the
discussions
had
that
day
the
boys
went
their
various
ways
their
minds
also
busy
with
the
events
of
the
afternoon
dirk
colson
and
stephen
crowley
went
off
together
not
that
they
were
special
friends
but
their
homes
lay
near
together
for
the
distance
of
half
a
block
they
walked
in
silence
then
stephen
crowley
spoke
his
mind
nimble
dick
was
near
as
smart
as
he
thinks
he
was
to
my
way
of
he
was
meaner
than
dirt
burst
forth
dirk
fiercely
to
go
back
on
her
like
that
after
she
had
saved
us
from
a
row
with
the
police
what
i
believe
in
why
could
he
have
picked
up
the
rag
seeing
she
wanted
him
to
that
what
say
i
a
done
it
myself
if
she
had
give
me
the
that
there
dick
bolton
can
be
too
mean
for
anything
when
he
sets
out
said
stephen
with
a
grave
air
of
superiority
i
do
go
in
for
anything
of
that
kind
myself
we
was
none
of
us
much
to
boast
of
but
dick
he
went
too
fur
i
say
dirk
what
do
you
all
that
yarn
means
about
night
and
what
be
we
goin
to
do
about
it
dick
he
said
it
was
all
a
game
to
get
hold
of
us
somehow
and
he
was
to
have
nothin
to
do
with
had
stephen
crowley
desired
exceedingly
to
secure
dirk
vote
in
favor
to
the
proposed
entertainment
he
could
not
at
that
moment
have
chosen
a
better
way
dirk
tossed
his
thick
mat
of
black
hair
in
a
defiant
fashion
and
answered
he
need
have
a
thing
to
do
with
it
so
far
as
i
care
i
do
know
who
miss
him
but
if
he
thinks
he
got
all
the
fellows
under
his
thumb
and
they
goin
to
do
as
he
says
i
show
him
a
thing
or
two
a
goin
night
i
do
care
what
it
is
nor
what
it
is
for
she
was
nice
and
friendly
to
us
and
i
willin
to
trust
her
i
shall
go
up
there
and
see
what
she
does
want
it
kill
a
fellow
to
do
that
then
i
a
goin
too
declared
stephen
with
decision
dick
he
thinks
there
wo
none
of
us
go
if
he
do
and
i
just
like
to
show
him
that
he
must
get
up
early
in
the
mornin
if
he
wants
to
keep
track
of
if
dirk
colson
needed
anything
to
strengthen
his
resolution
there
was
material
in
that
last
sentence
which
supplied
it
he
had
long
chafed
under
the
control
of
dick
bolton
here
was
a
chance
to
assert
superiority
he
even
just
at
that
moment
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
supplanting
dick
running
an
opposition
party
as
it
were
what
if
he
should
get
every
fellow
in
the
class
to
promise
to
go
and
dick
the
acknowledged
leader
should
find
himself
left
out
alone
in
the
cold
the
thought
actually
made
his
grim
face
break
into
a
smile
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
most
efficient
worker
for
the
success
of
the
monday
evening
entertainment
so
far
at
least
as
securing
the
presence
of
the
guests
was
dirk
colson
in
roberts
mansion
preparations
for
receiving
and
entertaining
the
guests
went
briskly
forward
preparations
which
astonished
the
young
guest
already
arrived
are
you
really
going
to
let
them
come
in
here
she
asked
as
she
followed
roberts
through
the
elegant
parlors
and
watched
her
putting
delicate
touches
here
and
there
certainly
why
not
do
you
open
your
parlors
when
you
receive
your
friends
i
do
think
we
have
such
peculiar
friends
on
our
list
gracie
said
with
a
little
laugh
and
then
flossy
they
will
spoil
your
if
one
evening
in
the
master
service
will
spoil
anything
it
surely
ought
to
be
spoiled
roberts
answered
serenely
but
flossy
with
a
touch
of
impatience
in
her
voice
what
is
the
use
would
the
answer
every
purpose
be
to
them
the
most
elegant
room
they
ever
beheld
and
be
less
likely
to
suffer
from
their
contact
the
busy
little
mistress
of
all
the
beauty
around
her
turned
to
her
guest
with
a
peculiar
smile
on
her
face
half
mischievous
and
wholly
sweet
as
she
said
i
want
them
to
get
used
to
parlors
my
dear
they
may
have
much
to
do
with
them
as
well
as
with
they
are
more
likely
to
have
to
do
with
penitentiaries
and
prisons
gracie
said
but
she
abandoned
discussion
and
gave
herself
to
the
pleasure
of
arranging
lonely
flowers
in
their
lovely
vases
there
was
a
divided
house
as
to
the
probability
of
the
guests
appearing
roberts
inclining
to
the
belief
that
some
of
them
would
come
while
gracie
was
entirely
skeptical
roberts
kept
her
own
counsel
neither
expressing
wish
nor
fear
but
steadily
pushing
her
preparations
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
entire
seven
appeared
together
promptly
as
the
clock
struck
eight
at
the
last
moment
dick
bolton
the
usual
leader
finding
himself
in
a
minority
of
one
not
to
be
outwitted
protested
that
he
had
not
the
least
notion
of
staying
away
of
course
he
was
going
and
joined
the
group
i
wonder
if
you
have
the
least
conception
of
how
those
boys
looked
the
ideas
of
some
people
can
not
get
below
clothes
carefully
brushed
boots
clean
collars
and
neatly
arranged
hair
clean
collars
not
a
boy
of
them
owned
a
collar
no
thought
of
brushing
their
unmended
boots
ever
entered
their
minds
their
clothes
were
much
patched
but
in
many
places
needed
it
still
stephen
crowley
had
made
a
somewhat
unsuccessful
attempt
to
put
his
mass
of
hair
in
order
most
of
the
others
had
not
thought
even
of
that
why
should
they
poor
dirk
you
will
remember
if
he
had
thought
of
it
had
no
comb
with
which
to
experiment
it
is
doubtful
if
many
of
the
others
were
any
better
off
in
this
respect
imagine
the
seven
standing
a
confused
grinning
heap
in
the
centre
of
roberts
large
and
hall
she
came
forward
to
welcome
them
shaking
hands
though
they
made
no
attempt
to
offer
a
hand
in
greeting
she
had
to
grasp
after
each
she
essayed
to
introduce
gracie
not
one
of
them
attempted
a
bow
come
this
way
roberts
said
and
take
then
she
led
the
way
into
the
long
bright
room
they
followed
her
in
a
row
midway
in
the
room
they
made
a
halt
they
caught
a
view
of
themselves
full
length
at
that
revealed
by
the
great
mirrors
they
had
never
seen
themselves
set
in
contrast
before
they
could
not
sit
in
a
row
for
the
easy
chairs
and
sofas
though
plentiful
had
the
air
of
having
been
just
vacated
by
people
who
had
left
them
carelessly
just
where
they
had
chanced
to
sit
it
required
diplomacy
to
seat
those
boys
when
at
last
stephen
crowley
dropped
into
one
of
the
great
pillowy
chairs
he
instantly
sprang
up
again
and
looked
at
it
doubtfully
was
the
thing
a
trap
how
far
down
would
it
sink
with
him
this
was
too
much
for
nimble
dick
even
under
the
present
overpowering
circumstances
he
laughed
his
hostess
blessed
him
for
that
laugh
the
horrible
stiffness
was
somewhat
broken
and
all
were
seated
just
at
that
moment
came
alfred
ried
hurriedly
like
one
who
had
intended
promptness
and
missed
it
all
here
ahead
of
me
he
exclaimed
mrs
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon
at
the
last
moment
i
went
in
search
of
everett
there
was
serious
illness
in
a
house
next
door
and
i
happened
to
know
just
where
he
during
this
address
he
was
shaking
hands
with
his
hostess
his
manner
easy
and
graceful
as
one
used
to
it
all
then
he
crossed
the
room
that
wonderful
room
treading
down
those
flowers
on
the
carpet
as
though
he
had
no
fears
of
breaking
their
stems
good
evening
miss
dennis
he
said
and
he
was
bowing
in
a
manner
that
dirk
colson
was
confident
he
could
imitate
then
he
turned
to
the
boys
shaking
hands
how
are
you
haskell
by
the
way
crowley
i
called
on
you
at
the
office
sorry
not
to
find
you
mrs
roberts
allow
me
and
he
wheeled
one
of
the
easy
chairs
to
the
spot
where
that
lady
was
standing
how
well
he
enters
into
the
thing
said
gracie
dennis
to
herself
looking
on
in
admiration
at
this
young
man
who
still
so
young
was
adapting
himself
to
circumstances
that
might
well
have
embarrassed
older
heads
than
his
he
plunged
into
talk
with
the
boys
making
them
answer
questions
he
had
come
but
a
few
moments
before
from
mark
calkins
stopped
there
with
a
message
from
everett
and
these
boys
knew
mark
and
sallie
and
the
worthless
father
and
all
the
more
or
less
worthless
neighbors
who
ran
in
and
out
and
young
ried
had
a
dozen
questions
to
ask
his
and
the
ease
with
which
he
made
talk
to
these
young
men
who
lived
in
such
an
utterly
different
world
from
himself
surprised
his
hostess
very
much
even
she
did
not
know
to
what
an
exalted
pitch
his
enthusiasm
and
excitement
reached
though
he
had
flashed
a
pair
of
most
appreciative
eyes
on
her
when
she
gave
him
her
invitation
for
the
evening
here
was
actually
his
sister
ester
darling
scheme
being
worked
out
before
his
eyes
not
only
that
but
he
was
being
called
upon
to
help
ester
had
wanted
him
to
grow
up
to
undertake
just
such
efforts
as
these
and
only
last
week
they
had
seemed
to
him
so
altogether
good
and
noble
and
so
impossible
to
try
yet
here
he
was
helping
try
them
no
wonder
alfred
ried
could
talk
it
had
been
determined
in
family
council
that
roberts
must
absent
himself
he
was
in
the
house
indeed
no
further
away
than
the
library
ready
for
call
in
event
of
an
emergency
but
it
was
judged
that
another
stranger
and
such
a
formidable
one
as
the
head
of
the
house
must
be
avoided
for
this
one
evening
as
for
ried
they
remember
that
he
was
not
much
older
than
some
of
them
and
that
he
was
not
a
rich
young
man
living
on
his
income
but
was
earning
his
living
by
daily
work
and
would
they
note
the
contrast
between
themselves
and
him
this
was
what
their
hostess
wondered
a
few
moments
and
then
came
a
summons
to
the
seated
at
last
though
one
of
the
poor
fellows
stumbled
over
a
chair
and
barely
saved
himself
from
falling
if
you
could
have
seen
that
the
picture
of
it
would
have
lingered
long
in
your
memory
the
whitest
and
finest
of
damask
table
linen
napkins
so
large
that
they
almost
justified
dick
whisper
what
be
you
goin
to
do
with
your
sheet
china
so
delicate
that
gracie
dennis
could
not
restrain
an
inward
shiver
when
any
of
the
clumsy
fingers
touched
a
bit
of
it
and
such
a
glitter
of
silver
as
even
gracie
had
never
seen
before
one
thing
was
different
from
the
conventional
every
servant
was
banished
none
but
tender
eyes
interested
in
her
experiment
and
ready
to
help
it
on
should
witness
the
blunders
of
the
boys
so
the
hostess
had
decreed
and
so
instructed
alfred
and
gracie
the
consequence
was
that
alfred
himself
served
the
steaming
oysters
with
liberal
hand
and
gracie
presided
over
jellies
and
sauces
while
roberts
sugared
and
creamed
and
poured
cups
of
such
coffee
as
those
fellows
had
never
even
before
if
you
think
they
were
embarrassed
to
the
degree
that
they
could
not
eat
you
are
mistaken
they
were
street
boys
their
lives
had
been
spent
in
a
hardening
atmosphere
directly
the
first
sense
of
novelty
passed
away
and
their
stomachs
craved
the
unusual
fare
served
up
for
them
the
fellows
grinned
at
one
another
seized
their
silver
spoons
and
dived
into
the
stews
in
a
fashion
that
would
have
horrified
every
servant
in
the
house
how
they
ate
oysters
and
coffee
and
pickles
and
cakes
and
jellies
there
seemed
no
limit
to
their
capacities
neither
did
they
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
correct
their
table
manners
none
of
them
paid
any
outward
attention
to
their
sheets
although
alfred
and
gracie
spread
theirs
with
elaborate
care
they
leaned
their
elbows
on
the
table
they
made
loud
swooping
sounds
with
their
lips
and
in
short
transgressed
every
law
known
to
civilized
life
why
not
what
did
they
know
about
civilized
life
nevertheless
not
one
movement
of
young
ried
escaped
the
notice
of
some
of
them
he
tried
still
to
carry
on
a
conversation
though
the
business
of
eating
was
being
too
closely
attended
to
on
all
sides
to
let
him
be
very
successful
gracie
studied
and
was
not
only
interested
in
his
efforts
but
roused
to
make
some
attempts
herself
what
could
she
talk
about
with
such
people
school
the
literary
club
the
last
concert
the
course
of
lectures
the
last
new
book
that
everybody
was
reading
no
not
everybody
assuredly
not
these
seven
on
what
ground
she
to
meet
them
yet
talk
she
must
and
would
ried
should
see
that
she
at
least
to
help
chapter
xiii
let
us
be
one
feature
of
the
hour
was
not
only
entirely
new
to
the
boys
but
gave
them
a
curious
feeling
the
name
of
which
they
did
not
understand
when
the
last
one
sat
back
in
his
chair
thereby
admitting
himself
vanquished
roberts
looking
at
the
young
man
who
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
said
will
you
return
thanks
what
did
that
mean
to
be
sure
they
had
heard
of
thanking
people
but
even
were
aware
that
it
was
an
unusual
thing
for
persons
to
demand
thanks
for
themselves
they
watched
behold
the
young
man
bowed
his
head
and
these
were
the
words
he
spoke
dear
saviour
we
thank
thee
for
the
joys
of
this
evening
we
pray
thee
to
teach
us
so
to
live
that
we
may
all
meet
some
day
in
our
house
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
then
looked
down
at
their
plates
their
sole
experience
of
prayer
was
connected
with
the
south
end
mission
to
meet
it
at
a
was
a
revelation
did
the
people
who
lived
in
grand
houses
and
had
such
wonderful
things
to
eat
always
pray
at
their
this
was
the
problem
which
they
were
turning
over
in
their
minds
returning
to
the
parlor
gracie
went
at
once
to
the
piano
she
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
monday
settling
the
question
of
what
to
play
and
had
chosen
the
most
sparkling
music
she
could
find
i
am
anxious
to
have
it
recorded
that
all
uncultured
as
they
were
these
boys
neither
talked
nor
laughed
during
the
music
but
appeared
at
least
to
listen
it
was
dirk
colton
who
sat
nearest
to
the
piano
and
who
listened
in
that
indescribable
way
which
always
flatters
a
musician
do
you
like
it
gracie
asked
running
off
the
final
notes
in
a
tinkle
of
melody
his
dark
face
flushed
a
deep
red
i
dunno
he
said
with
an
awkward
laugh
it
queer
sounding
i
see
how
you
make
so
many
tinkles
do
you
make
all
your
fingers
go
at
once
on
those
black
and
white
things
not
quite
but
sometimes
they
have
to
dance
about
in
a
very
lively
fashion
i
have
to
keep
my
wits
at
work
i
assure
is
it
hard
to
do
not
very
nowadays
when
i
first
commenced
the
practising
was
horrid
i
hated
what
made
you
do
it
then
oh
the
same
reason
which
makes
people
do
a
great
many
things
that
they
do
like
she
said
lightly
i
wanted
the
results
i
knew
if
i
worked
at
it
steadily
the
time
would
come
when
i
should
not
only
enjoy
it
myself
but
be
able
to
give
pleasure
to
other
people
why
do
you
ever
do
things
that
you
do
particularly
like
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
bestowed
on
her
a
very
wise
look
often
enough
he
said
fiercely
and
he
thought
of
his
drunken
father
but
then
i
would
if
i
could
help
that
would
depend
on
whether
you
thought
the
thing
would
pay
in
the
end
would
it
not
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
asked
what
is
your
business
my
business
with
a
curiously
puzzled
air
yes
how
do
you
spend
your
time
hunting
up
something
to
eat
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
visions
of
his
aimless
loafing
appearing
before
him
as
the
only
occupation
he
could
be
said
to
have
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
try
to
mislead
her
but
she
evidently
did
not
understand
oh
yes
she
said
seriously
so
i
suppose
is
it
queer
how
busy
men
and
women
have
to
be
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
just
getting
themselves
and
others
something
to
eat
do
you
have
other
people
to
help
get
it
for
mother
for
instance
and
little
brothers
and
sisters
i
got
a
mother
he
said
and
a
and
that
makes
work
easier
does
it
not
i
always
thought
it
would
be
stupid
to
work
all
the
time
just
for
one
self
but
i
meant
what
do
you
work
at
in
order
to
get
the
something
to
eat
there
are
so
many
different
ways
how
do
you
know
i
work
at
all
dirk
voice
was
growing
sullen
a
consciousness
that
he
would
appear
at
a
disadvantage
in
admitting
himself
an
idler
in
a
busy
world
was
dawning
upon
him
as
an
entirely
new
idea
at
his
question
gracie
turned
on
her
and
regarded
him
with
surprise
why
of
course
you
work
she
said
people
all
she
was
not
acting
a
part
her
experience
among
poor
people
was
limited
to
that
outwardly
respectable
class
who
however
disreputable
their
conduct
might
be
on
sabbath
had
nevertheless
a
monday
occupation
with
which
they
pretended
to
earn
a
living
dirk
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
do
they
he
said
her
evident
ignorance
of
the
world
made
him
she
was
not
trying
to
preach
to
him
he
decided
a
thing
which
dirk
hated
in
common
with
all
persons
of
his
class
but
the
lull
in
the
music
had
started
conversation
in
other
parts
of
the
room
dirk
heard
young
ried
question
mrs
roberts
do
you
know
of
any
young
man
looking
for
work
i
heard
of
a
good
situation
this
afternoon
oh
there
are
plenty
of
applicants
but
the
gentleman
is
an
old
friend
of
my
and
i
could
speak
a
helpful
word
for
i
have
no
one
in
mind
roberts
said
and
she
glanced
eagerly
at
the
boys
lounging
in
various
attitudes
in
her
easy
chairs
only
three
of
them
she
knew
made
any
pretence
of
earning
their
living
did
alfred
mean
one
of
them
here
is
a
chance
for
you
young
gentlemen
she
said
lightly
who
bids
for
a
situation
what
is
the
place
it
was
dirk
colson
who
asked
the
question
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
hunting
for
work
but
i
am
not
sure
that
he
ever
felt
quite
such
a
desire
to
find
it
as
at
that
moment
it
is
at
gray
on
ninth
street
a
good
chance
but
the
one
who
secures
it
must
have
a
fair
knowledge
of
oh
land
said
dirk
sinking
lower
in
his
no
use
in
asking
about
are
figures
your
weak
point
roberts
asked
smiling
on
him
i
can
sympathize
with
you
i
had
to
work
harder
over
arithmetic
than
at
any
other
study
but
i
learned
to
like
it
do
you
know
i
think
it
should
be
a
favorite
study
with
you
it
is
so
nice
to
conquer
an
row
of
figures
and
fairly
oblige
the
right
result
to
appear
what
did
you
find
hardest
about
the
study
colson
the
others
chuckled
but
dirk
glowered
at
them
fiercely
there
nothin
to
laugh
about
as
i
see
he
said
i
did
find
nothin
hard
because
i
never
had
no
chance
to
try
i
never
went
to
no
school
nor
had
books
nor
nothin
now
that
the
truth
and
i
blamed
if
i
ai
going
to
own
what
a
good
thing
it
is
that
you
are
this
was
her
animated
answer
there
is
a
chance
to
make
up
for
lost
time
ried
i
have
such
a
nice
idea
i
heard
you
and
everett
speaking
of
the
literary
club
the
other
night
why
can
not
we
have
a
literary
club
of
our
own
a
reading
circle
or
something
of
that
sort
suppose
we
should
meet
once
a
week
and
read
aloud
something
interesting
and
have
talks
about
it
afterwards
do
you
ever
read
aloud
if
roberts
in
all
sincerity
had
not
been
one
of
the
most
and
in
some
respects
ignorant
little
creatures
on
the
face
of
the
globe
she
could
never
with
serious
face
have
addressed
such
a
question
to
nimble
dick
young
ried
could
not
have
done
it
for
he
realized
the
folly
of
supposing
that
nimble
dick
ever
read
anything
by
just
so
much
was
roberts
ahead
of
him
she
supposed
that
these
boys
had
their
literature
and
read
it
and
perhaps
met
somewhere
on
occasion
and
read
together
this
made
it
possible
for
her
to
ask
surprising
questions
with
honest
face
bless
me
said
nimble
dick
startled
into
an
upright
posture
oh
no
mum
and
even
dirk
colson
laughed
at
the
expression
on
his
face
still
i
think
you
would
enjoy
it
after
a
little
practice
and
i
help
fancying
you
would
make
a
good
the
boys
were
all
laughing
now
nimble
dick
with
the
rest
you
in
for
an
awful
blunder
there
he
said
like
black
dirk
never
had
no
chances
and
did
do
nothin
worth
speakin
of
with
them
that
i
had
why
bless
your
body
mum
i
even
read
to
myself
i
make
the
awfulest
work
you
ever
heard
of
out
the
i
have
to
get
black
dirk
to
help
me
and
him
and
me
is
a
by
this
time
dirk
face
had
lost
its
smile
and
his
fierce
eyes
were
flashing
but
the
hostess
was
serene
that
does
prove
anything
against
my
statement
i
was
speaking
of
what
be
not
necessarily
of
what
was
let
us
have
a
club
the
more
i
think
of
the
plan
the
more
it
pleases
me
i
tell
you
the
word
does
quite
suit
me
let
us
be
fashionable
gracie
do
you
know
how
fashionable
it
is
becoming
to
have
set
apart
for
special
occasions
ried
you
know
judson
evenings
and
symond
evenings
very
well
let
us
have
our
evenings
in
which
we
will
do
all
sorts
of
nice
things
sometimes
literary
sometimes
musical
and
sometimes
well
anything
that
we
please
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
shall
we
organize
ried
will
you
give
monday
evenings
to
us
gracie
you
are
my
guest
and
can
not
of
course
it
was
a
novel
idea
certainly
even
alfred
while
trying
to
heartily
second
her
was
in
doubt
as
to
what
she
could
hope
to
accomplish
by
it
as
for
the
boys
not
one
of
them
promised
to
attend
but
neither
did
they
refuse
roberts
presently
left
the
subject
seeming
to
consider
her
point
carried
and
proposed
a
visit
to
the
conservatory
i
think
it
very
doubtful
whether
the
boy
lives
who
does
not
like
flowers
there
are
those
who
seem
to
consider
it
a
mark
of
manliness
to
affect
indifference
to
them
but
these
as
they
grow
older
become
real
men
generally
lay
this
bit
of
folly
aside
then
there
are
those
plenty
of
them
who
really
do
not
know
that
they
care
for
flowers
the
boys
ushered
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
into
the
full
bloom
of
a
conservatory
were
most
of
them
of
this
latter
stamp
what
a
scene
of
beauty
it
was
great
white
callas
bending
their
graceful
cups
great
red
and
yellow
roses
making
the
air
rich
with
their
breath
vines
and
mosses
and
ferns
and
small
flowers
in
almost
endless
variety
alfred
and
gracie
moved
among
the
glories
the
latter
exhausting
all
her
superlatives
in
honest
delight
although
she
had
visited
the
spot
a
dozen
times
that
day
and
alfred
who
had
been
less
favored
was
hardly
less
eager
and
responsive
than
she
but
roberts
watched
the
boys
it
was
all
very
well
for
those
two
to
enjoy
her
flowers
of
course
they
would
but
what
language
would
the
silent
lovely
things
speak
to
her
untutored
boys
they
said
not
a
word
not
one
of
them
they
made
no
exclamations
they
had
no
superlatives
at
command
but
stephen
crowley
stooped
before
a
lovely
carnation
and
smelled
and
drawing
in
long
breaths
as
though
he
meant
to
take
its
fragrance
all
away
with
him
and
nimble
dick
picked
up
the
straying
end
of
an
ivy
and
restored
it
to
its
support
again
in
a
way
that
was
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
by
one
who
was
looking
for
hearts
and
dirk
colson
brushed
back
his
matted
hair
and
stood
long
before
a
great
pure
lily
and
looked
down
into
its
heart
with
an
expression
on
his
face
that
his
teacher
never
forgot
she
came
over
to
him
presently
standing
beside
him
saying
nothing
then
at
last
she
reached
forth
her
hand
and
broke
the
lily
from
its
stalk
he
started
almost
as
if
something
had
struck
him
what
did
you
do
that
for
and
his
voice
was
fierce
i
want
you
to
take
this
for
me
to
your
sister
the
girl
with
beautiful
golden
hair
i
saw
her
one
day
and
i
shall
remember
her
hair
and
eyes
she
will
like
this
flower
and
she
will
like
you
to
bring
it
to
her
gracie
raising
her
voice
gather
some
flowers
will
you
and
make
into
bouquets
these
young
gentlemen
will
like
to
carry
them
to
some
one
there
must
be
mothers
at
home
who
will
enjoy
bouquets
brought
by
their
over
this
sentence
nimble
dick
laughed
a
hard
derisive
laugh
it
made
the
dark
blood
flow
into
black
dirk
indignant
face
even
alfred
ried
lost
for
a
moment
and
flashed
a
glance
at
him
out
of
angry
eyes
how
could
there
be
any
hope
of
a
boy
who
sneered
at
his
mother
yet
you
need
not
judge
him
too
harshly
he
thought
of
his
mother
indeed
when
he
laughed
but
alas
he
thought
of
her
as
drunk
and
he
knew
her
scarcely
at
all
save
as
that
word
described
her
how
mother
mean
to
him
what
it
meant
to
alfred
ried
what
it
meant
even
to
dirk
colson
whose
mother
weak
indeed
in
body
and
spirit
full
of
complaining
words
oftentimes
weakly
bitter
words
to
him
yet
patched
his
clothes
so
long
as
she
could
get
patches
and
thread
and
would
have
washed
them
if
she
could
have
got
soap
and
been
able
to
bring
the
water
and
if
her
only
tub
had
been
in
pawn
oh
yes
there
are
degrees
in
mothers
roberts
meantime
broke
off
blossoms
with
lavish
hand
and
made
bouquets
for
nimble
dick
and
for
dirk
he
took
the
ones
with
a
smile
but
the
lily
he
held
by
itself
and
still
looked
at
it
they
went
away
at
last
noisily
growing
almost
if
not
quite
rough
towards
one
another
at
least
and
directly
they
were
out
of
the
door
nimble
dick
gave
a
whoop
that
would
have
chilled
the
blood
of
nervous
women
but
matron
and
maiden
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
we
have
kept
them
pent
up
all
the
evening
and
that
is
the
being
raised
to
avoid
a
general
this
was
explanation
they
were
quite
alone
alfred
on
being
invited
in
low
tones
to
tarry
and
talk
things
over
had
shaken
his
head
and
replied
significantly
thank
you
no
i
am
one
of
them
and
must
stand
on
the
same
you
are
right
roberts
said
smilingly
you
must
have
been
an
apt
pupil
my
friend
that
dear
sister
taught
you
a
great
he
held
up
the
bouquet
which
she
had
made
for
him
i
am
going
to
put
it
before
ester
picture
he
said
her
work
is
going
well
said
gracie
it
is
over
and
we
lived
through
it
and
they
all
come
i
am
amazed
over
that
and
how
they
i
suppose
the
next
thing
is
to
open
all
the
windows
and
air
out
flossy
roberts
i
afraid
you
are
going
insane
the
idea
of
your
inviting
that
horde
here
every
monday
what
a
parlor
you
would
have
and
they
would
breed
a
pestilence
they
wo
come
to
be
sure
but
just
imagine
it
if
they
should
i
really
think
roberts
ought
to
send
you
home
for
mitchell
to
look
after
well
flossy
what
next
next
dear
you
must
pray
pray
as
you
never
have
done
before
for
the
souls
of
these
boys
and
for
the
success
of
my
evenings
gracie
we
are
at
work
for
immortal
think
of
it
they
live
forever
shall
they
through
all
eternity
keep
dropping
lower
and
lower
or
shall
they
wear
crowns
chapter
xiv
something
happened
sallie
calkins
sat
in
a
common
little
and
rocked
and
while
she
rocked
she
sewed
setting
neat
stitches
in
a
brown
coat
which
was
already
patched
and
darned
and
was
threadbare
in
many
places
there
was
a
look
of
deep
content
on
sallie
face
there
were
many
reasons
for
it
everett
had
that
morning
pronounced
mark
broken
limb
to
be
healing
rapidly
he
had
also
reported
that
mark
place
was
to
be
held
open
for
him
by
his
employers
at
this
present
moment
mark
arrayed
in
a
clean
shirt
was
resting
on
a
very
white
sheet
his
head
reposing
on
a
real
feather
pillow
dressed
in
white
and
frilled
over
him
was
carefully
spread
another
of
those
wonderful
sheets
and
to
make
the
crowning
glory
a
white
quilt
warm
and
soft
tucked
him
in
on
every
side
how
could
sallie
but
rejoice
all
about
the
room
there
had
been
changes
a
neat
little
table
stood
at
the
bed
side
it
was
covered
with
a
white
cloth
and
a
china
bowl
set
thereon
with
a
silver
spoon
beside
it
a
delicate
goblet
and
china
pitcher
also
both
carefully
covered
with
a
napkin
did
roberts
know
how
homely
sallie
gloried
in
the
thinness
of
that
china
and
the
fineness
of
that
napkin
how
does
it
happen
that
some
of
the
very
poor
seem
born
with
such
aesthetic
tastes
roberts
had
intuitions
and
was
given
to
certain
acts
concerning
which
she
could
not
give
to
others
satisfactory
explanations
therefore
she
sometimes
left
china
where
others
would
have
judged
the
plainest
stoneware
more
prudent
and
sensible
a
bit
of
bright
carpet
was
spread
at
the
side
of
the
bed
a
fire
glowed
in
the
stove
a
white
muslin
curtain
hung
at
the
window
and
the
chair
in
which
sallie
rocked
and
sewed
was
new
and
gayly
painted
there
were
other
traces
of
roberts
you
might
not
have
noticed
them
but
it
seemed
to
sallie
that
her
fingers
had
touched
everywhere
yet
the
lady
herself
thought
that
she
had
done
very
little
she
had
held
her
inclinations
in
check
with
severe
judgment
the
door
opened
softly
and
a
mass
of
golden
hair
from
out
of
which
peered
great
eyes
peeped
cautiously
in
alone
it
said
nodding
first
toward
the
figure
on
the
bed
and
intimating
that
she
was
aware
of
mark
presence
and
did
not
mean
him
yes
said
sallie
come
in
mark
asleep
but
you
wo
disturb
him
he
do
disturb
easy
he
sleeps
just
like
a
baby
since
the
doctor
stopped
that
pain
in
his
knee
there
my
new
chair
just
try
it
and
see
how
nice
it
saying
which
she
got
herself
out
of
the
little
rocker
in
haste
and
pushed
it
toward
her
guest
meantime
taking
a
plain
wooden
chair
also
new
and
adding
did
you
ever
hear
of
anybody
like
her
before
something
happened
said
mart
colson
ignoring
the
reference
to
the
mysterious
pronoun
her
voice
so
full
of
a
new
and
strange
meaning
that
had
sallie
been
acquainted
with
the
word
she
might
have
said
it
was
filled
with
awe
as
it
was
she
only
exclaimed
what
in
an
intensely
interested
tone
why
look
here
i
brought
it
along
to
show
whereupon
she
produced
from
under
her
piece
of
torn
shawl
a
large
pitcher
a
piece
of
brown
paper
carefully
tied
over
the
top
she
untied
the
bit
of
calico
string
with
fingers
that
shook
from
excitement
look
in
there
she
exclaimed
at
last
triumph
in
her
tone
reaching
forward
the
pitcher
sallie
looked
and
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
long
expressive
there
reposing
in
stately
beauty
lay
the
great
white
lily
with
its
golden
bell
yes
i
should
think
so
mart
said
satisfied
with
the
expression
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
that
before
it
ai
made
of
wax
nor
anything
else
that
ever
made
it
alive
i
felt
of
it
it
looks
like
velvet
and
satin
and
all
them
lovely
store
things
but
it
feel
so
it
feels
and
it
but
sallie
calkins
if
you
should
live
a
hundred
years
and
guess
all
the
time
you
never
could
guess
where
i
got
it
sallie
calkins
if
you
believe
it
dirk
gave
it
to
me
dirk
yes
he
did
who
would
have
supposed
mart
colson
voice
capable
of
such
a
triumphant
ring
you
see
the
way
of
it
was
last
night
he
did
come
for
his
supper
at
all
and
that
always
scares
me
dreadful
i
expecting
something
to
happen
you
know
father
he
did
come
either
for
the
matter
of
that
he
has
come
yet
and
mother
she
was
awful
tired
and
had
had
no
dinner
to
speak
of
and
she
just
broke
down
and
took
on
awful
mother
do
often
cry
and
it
good
she
do
for
she
just
goes
into
it
with
all
her
might
when
the
time
comes
it
was
about
father
she
used
to
him
you
know
and
do
expect
nothing
else
but
dirk
drives
her
wild
with
what
may
happen
to
him
i
was
worried
about
him
too
but
i
was
mad
at
him
it
seemed
too
awful
mean
in
him
to
stay
away
and
scare
mother
at
last
i
got
her
to
go
to
bed
and
she
was
all
tuckered
out
and
went
to
sleep
then
i
wrapped
myself
in
the
quilt
and
sat
down
to
wait
but
i
got
asleep
and
i
dreamed
i
saw
she
had
wings
to
each
side
of
her
and
she
flew
over
the
tops
of
all
those
houses
and
made
them
turn
white
like
the
snow
looks
when
it
is
coming
down
before
it
drops
into
the
gutters
was
that
queer
well
some
noise
woke
me
up
i
was
sitting
flat
on
the
floor
by
mother
and
i
sat
up
straight
all
of
a
tremble
and
there
was
the
old
stool
and
the
brown
pitcher
on
it
of
water
and
this
wonderful
thing
stood
in
it
looking
at
me
and
dirk
he
stood
off
the
other
side
looking
at
it
for
you
and
she
sent
it
that
what
he
said
to
me
and
i
was
real
wide
awake
you
know
i
suppose
that
what
made
his
voice
sound
so
queer
and
what
do
you
think
i
said
i
was
thinking
of
my
dream
and
says
i
she
have
her
wings
on
then
dirk
made
a
queer
noise
it
was
a
laugh
but
it
sounded
most
like
a
cry
guess
so
says
he
and
then
he
turned
and
went
off
to
bed
and
i
ca
get
any
more
out
of
him
he
is
as
snarly
when
i
ask
any
questions
as
though
he
was
mad
about
it
all
if
it
had
been
for
this
great
white
thing
i
might
have
thought
this
morning
that
it
all
belonged
to
the
dream
but
dirk
brought
this
home
from
somewhere
and
put
it
in
the
pitcher
and
give
it
to
me
his
own
self
that
the
story
closed
in
triumph
it
is
beautiful
said
sallie
the
brown
jacket
slipping
to
the
floor
while
she
bent
over
the
lily
it
is
beautiful
all
of
it
and
it
looks
just
like
her
and
sounds
like
her
wings
and
all
of
course
she
sent
and
dirk
brought
that
part
of
the
story
mart
colson
did
not
forget
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
a
pity
that
hearts
are
not
laid
bare
to
the
gaze
of
others
what
for
instance
might
not
this
little
incident
have
done
for
dirk
colson
had
he
known
how
the
starved
heart
of
his
sister
fed
on
the
thought
that
he
brought
her
the
flower
still
on
the
other
hand
i
do
know
what
the
effect
would
have
been
on
mart
had
she
known
what
a
tremendous
amount
of
courage
it
had
taken
to
present
the
flower
to
her
a
dozen
times
on
the
way
home
had
dirk
been
on
the
point
of
consigning
it
to
the
gutter
carry
home
a
flower
if
it
had
been
a
loaf
of
bread
he
thought
it
would
be
more
consistent
someway
he
recognized
a
fine
sarcasm
in
the
thought
that
he
who
had
never
in
his
life
contributed
towards
the
necessities
of
the
family
should
carry
to
that
dreary
home
a
flower
yet
the
fair
lily
did
its
work
well
during
that
long
walk
from
east
street
to
the
shadow
of
the
alley
it
made
dirk
colson
tell
it
fiercely
that
he
hated
himself
that
he
was
a
brute
and
a
loafer
a
blot
on
the
earth
and
ought
not
to
live
why
did
he
go
to
work
why
did
he
have
things
to
bring
home
to
mart
every
little
while
as
mark
calkins
did
to
sallie
had
he
seen
mark
only
a
few
evenings
before
he
was
hurt
with
a
pair
of
girl
shoes
strung
over
his
shoulder
and
heard
him
whistle
as
he
ran
two
steps
at
a
time
up
the
rickety
stairs
what
would
mart
think
if
he
should
bring
her
home
a
pair
of
shoes
what
would
she
think
of
his
bringing
her
a
flower
she
would
sneer
of
course
and
in
the
mood
which
then
possessed
him
dirk
said
angrily
that
she
had
a
right
to
sneer
and
would
be
a
fool
not
to
and
yet
he
hated
the
thought
of
it
there
was
nothing
in
life
that
dirk
hated
more
than
sneers
and
he
had
been
fed
on
them
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
was
altogether
unprepared
for
the
reception
which
the
lily
received
that
suggestion
about
wings
which
seemed
so
apt
had
brought
the
queer
sound
to
his
voice
that
mart
had
noticed
if
only
she
had
understood
and
not
spoiled
next
morning
the
effect
of
her
words
in
the
prosaic
daylight
the
illusion
of
wings
being
banished
she
was
bent
on
knowing
how
dirk
came
into
possession
of
the
lily
who
sent
it
dirk
i
do
believe
anybody
told
you
to
give
it
to
me
who
would
care
about
having
a
flower
where
did
you
get
it
where
do
you
dirk
voice
was
ominously
gruff
it
is
a
painful
truth
that
by
daylight
he
was
ashamed
of
his
part
of
the
transaction
i
told
you
she
sent
it
it
noways
likely
that
i
take
the
trouble
to
make
up
a
lie
about
that
weed
how
do
i
know
what
she
wanted
you
to
have
it
for
maybe
she
thought
it
matched
your
there
was
a
bitter
sneer
in
dirk
voice
yet
all
the
time
he
heard
the
sweet
low
voice
saying
that
girl
with
the
beautiful
golden
suppose
he
should
tell
mart
that
why
not
let
me
tell
you
that
dirk
colson
would
not
have
repeated
that
sentence
for
the
world
and
yet
he
did
not
know
why
mart
face
burned
red
under
his
sneer
how
am
i
to
know
who
is
she
said
in
bitter
scorn
some
of
your
beauties
for
whom
you
dance
and
whistle
i
suppose
you
can
tell
her
i
would
rather
have
my
shawl
out
of
pawn
or
some
shoes
for
my
feet
enough
sight
what
do
i
care
for
a
great
flower
mocking
at
me
pitch
it
into
the
fire
then
and
it
will
be
many
a
long
day
before
i
bring
you
anything
else
said
dirk
pushing
himself
angrily
back
from
the
table
where
he
had
been
eating
bread
dipped
in
a
choice
bit
of
pork
fat
there
is
a
bit
of
danger
of
my
doing
that
she
called
after
him
mockingly
there
is
a
spark
of
fire
nor
likely
to
be
unless
some
of
your
admirers
send
me
a
shovel
of
coal
mercy
knows
i
wish
they
he
mercifully
lost
part
of
this
sentence
for
the
reason
that
before
it
was
concluded
he
was
moving
with
long
angry
strides
up
the
alley
and
then
mart
took
the
pitcher
away
into
the
furthermost
corner
although
she
was
alone
in
the
room
and
laid
her
face
against
the
cool
pure
lily
and
wept
into
it
great
burning
tears
poor
ignorant
soul
she
wanted
oh
how
she
dirk
to
be
brave
and
good
like
mark
calkins
her
one
type
of
manhood
yet
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
crushing
out
the
germ
which
might
have
grown
in
his
heart
true
she
knew
herself
to
be
very
different
from
sallie
but
the
thought
poor
soul
that
that
was
because
mark
was
so
different
from
dirk
is
it
a
pity
that
the
lily
could
not
have
told
its
tender
story
to
both
these
ignorant
ones
chapter
xv
what
made
her
different
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
your
sister
that
has
interested
me
do
you
like
to
talk
of
her
this
was
the
question
which
gracie
dennis
asked
of
young
ried
as
he
stood
beside
her
at
the
piano
she
had
been
playing
and
had
come
to
the
music
alcove
for
the
purpose
of
turning
her
music
but
now
she
was
touching
sweet
chords
here
and
there
aimlessly
and
waiting
for
his
answer
at
the
further
end
of
the
parlor
roberts
was
entertaining
a
caller
but
the
distance
between
them
was
so
great
that
in
effect
the
young
people
were
alone
i
like
nothing
better
than
to
talk
of
ried
said
with
animation
but
i
do
know
so
much
about
her
as
i
wish
i
did
she
went
away
when
i
was
quite
young
i
used
to
say
died
but
since
i
have
awakened
to
see
her
cherished
plans
being
carried
on
all
around
me
i
can
not
think
of
her
as
that
is
what
i
want
to
talk
about
her
work
or
her
plans
for
work
what
made
her
so
different
from
other
people
ried
she
different
the
young
man
regarded
the
question
thoughtfully
before
answering
not
from
all
the
people
he
said
at
last
but
certainly
very
different
from
some
i
used
to
think
that
all
christians
were
like
her
of
course
then
when
i
saw
my
mistake
i
went
to
the
other
extreme
and
thought
there
were
none
like
her
on
earth
i
have
discovered
that
the
medium
position
is
the
correct
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
her
different
it
was
her
age
roberts
thinks
she
was
young
she
was
hardly
nineteen
when
she
died
oh
no
it
was
age
she
told
me
that
she
used
to
be
very
different
she
was
a
christian
from
childhood
but
she
said
that
she
was
ashamed
to
claim
the
name
there
was
nothing
christlike
about
her
still
she
was
a
member
of
the
church
as
i
remember
her
and
as
i
look
at
other
people
my
judgment
is
that
in
her
early
christian
life
she
was
much
like
most
of
the
christians
with
whom
you
and
i
are
and
what
made
her
different
was
it
that
is
do
you
think
it
was
because
she
was
to
die
so
soon
that
she
had
a
special
experience
not
at
all
he
said
promptly
it
was
before
she
realized
anything
about
her
condition
that
the
great
change
took
place
in
her
my
says
that
she
supposed
herself
to
be
in
perfect
health
at
the
time
when
she
was
most
marked
in
her
christian
ah
but
you
do
understand
i
mean
more
than
that
it
is
difficult
to
tell
what
i
mean
i
mean
but
you
know
of
course
knew
that
she
was
soon
to
go
to
heaven
i
thought
perhaps
he
gave
her
a
special
experience
on
that
no
oh
no
he
said
speaking
with
great
earnestness
ester
was
particularly
anxious
that
no
one
should
suppose
her
experience
exceptional
little
fellow
though
i
was
it
seemed
to
be
her
desire
that
i
should
fully
understand
this
do
let
anybody
make
you
think
that
because
you
are
a
little
boy
you
must
be
a
sort
of
christian
she
used
to
say
and
her
eyes
would
glow
with
feeling
tried
that
way
for
years
she
said
i
want
you
to
understand
that
it
is
not
only
sinful
but
there
is
not
a
particle
of
happiness
to
be
gotten
out
of
it
not
a
particle
and
i
would
give
almost
nothing
for
what
such
a
christian
can
accomplish
the
harm
one
does
more
than
overbalances
all
effort
for
christ
i
think
perhaps
she
felt
more
deeply
on
that
than
on
almost
any
subject
and
it
was
because
she
thought
she
had
wasted
so
many
then
do
you
think
that
there
is
or
rather
that
there
should
be
no
difference
in
christians
have
all
the
same
work
to
do
not
that
quite
of
course
or
i
do
know
either
is
it
all
different
forms
of
the
master
work
the
children
of
the
home
may
have
each
a
different
task
but
each
is
needed
to
make
the
home
what
it
should
be
and
each
worker
needs
the
same
spirit
of
love
and
unselfishness
to
enable
him
to
do
his
part
it
is
a
perfect
illustration
miss
dennis
i
not
skillful
in
that
direction
but
know
what
i
mean
and
that
is
a
and
i
know
what
you
mean
gracie
said
not
joining
in
his
laugh
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
believe
it
why
ried
that
would
make
a
very
solemn
thing
of
well
did
you
suppose
it
was
other
than
solemn
i
sure
it
makes
a
triumphant
thing
of
it
too
and
without
it
we
are
only
a
lot
of
wax
figures
dancing
to
pass
the
time
but
do
you
really
think
that
people
have
a
right
to
have
nice
times
miss
dennis
did
you
ever
see
any
person
who
had
nicer
times
than
your
friend
roberts
well
flossy
is
peculiar
her
tastes
all
seem
to
lie
in
this
direction
though
once
they
did
not
i
admit
papa
used
to
think
that
she
had
no
talent
for
anything
but
dancing
something
changed
flossy
entire
character
no
one
who
knew
her
two
years
ago
could
possibly
deny
she
will
serve
as
an
illustration
then
to
explain
my
meaning
i
believe
miss
dennis
that
religion
should
have
sufficient
power
over
us
to
change
all
our
tastes
and
plans
in
life
fitting
them
to
the
saviour
but
what
would
such
a
rule
as
that
do
with
most
of
the
christians
of
your
acquaintance
ah
i
am
old
and
experienced
enough
to
warn
you
not
to
make
shipwreck
of
your
happiness
on
that
shoal
i
hovered
around
it
and
vexed
my
soul
over
the
whole
bewildering
question
until
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
was
held
absolutely
responsible
only
for
my
own
soul
and
that
the
lord
would
look
after
his
for
a
time
there
was
no
answer
to
this
gracie
let
her
fingers
wander
with
apparent
aimlessness
over
the
keys
drawing
out
soft
sweet
strains
suddenly
she
said
what
do
you
expect
flossy
will
accomplish
with
that
last
scheme
of
hers
i
ought
to
beg
her
pardon
for
the
familiar
name
but
i
have
known
her
ever
since
i
was
a
child
do
you
think
her
attempts
for
those
boys
rather
hopeless
instantly
the
young
man
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
indicated
deep
emotion
i
can
hardly
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
those
boys
i
have
been
anxious
for
them
so
long
and
felt
so
hopeless
do
you
remember
how
elijah
sat
under
a
juniper
tree
discouraged
and
said
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
bowed
the
knee
to
baal
and
the
lord
told
him
he
was
mistaken
that
there
were
five
thousand
others
it
sounds
ridiculously
egotistical
but
i
have
felt
at
times
something
like
that
as
though
i
was
the
only
one
who
cared
whether
the
poor
fellows
went
to
destruction
or
not
but
since
i
have
met
roberts
and
seen
how
intense
she
is
and
and
since
through
her
i
have
met
everett
and
seen
how
they
are
trying
to
work
at
the
same
problem
and
since
i
have
come
to
know
how
roberts
is
at
work
all
the
time
for
young
men
and
above
all
since
that
wonderful
evening
here
last
monday
when
i
saw
how
two
gifted
ladies
understood
the
art
of
turning
their
accomplishments
to
account
in
order
to
take
those
poor
fellows
captive
for
christ
i
discovered
that
there
were
ways
of
solving
this
problem
about
which
i
had
known
nothing
and
people
to
carry
it
through
it
was
simply
glorious
in
you
to
give
those
fellows
such
music
as
you
did
and
to
accomplish
by
it
what
you
did
my
life
has
been
narrow
miss
dennis
i
never
saw
the
piano
used
for
christ
gracie
looked
down
at
the
keys
her
face
aglow
it
was
a
new
experience
this
being
classed
among
the
christian
workers
of
the
world
making
her
music
for
other
purposes
than
to
amuse
the
gay
friends
who
chanced
to
gather
around
her
she
made
the
keys
speak
loudly
for
a
few
minutes
then
softening
them
said
you
must
not
class
me
with
flossy
ried
i
only
did
what
she
wanted
done
i
am
not
in
the
least
like
her
unselfish
and
gentle
and
all
but
his
reply
spoken
low
was
pleasant
to
her
ears
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
he
evidently
looked
upon
her
as
a
worker
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
was
pleasant
to
be
so
classed
what
an
intense
young
man
he
was
not
in
the
least
like
those
with
whom
she
had
hitherto
been
most
familiar
there
was
another
voice
in
the
front
parlor
a
strong
vigorous
voice
that
carried
a
sense
of
power
with
it
ah
said
ried
his
eyes
bright
his
face
eager
that
is
everett
just
study
him
if
you
want
another
type
of
the
sort
of
christian
about
whom
we
have
been
talking
the
grandest
man
gracie
shielded
by
the
distance
turned
on
her
stool
and
studied
him
certainly
he
did
not
look
much
as
though
he
were
appointed
for
early
death
what
a
splendid
physique
it
was
and
how
thoroughly
wide
awake
and
interested
he
was
in
the
subject
under
discussion
bits
of
the
talk
floated
back
to
the
two
at
the
piano
oh
he
is
young
everett
was
saying
i
hope
for
returned
vigor
in
time
but
there
must
be
long
weeks
of
patience
before
he
will
be
ready
for
his
old
do
you
know
of
whom
he
is
speaking
gracie
asked
i
fancy
it
is
that
calkins
boy
the
one
with
the
broken
limb
he
is
deeply
interested
in
the
poor
fellow
and
is
trying
to
plan
employment
of
some
less
wearing
sort
for
him
i
believe
everett
is
always
intensely
interested
in
is
it
always
the
very
poor
alfred
laughed
not
always
i
know
several
quite
fellows
in
whom
he
keeps
a
careful
oversight
but
he
is
grandly
interested
in
the
poor
he
is
taking
rank
as
one
of
the
most
successful
physicians
in
the
city
and
of
course
he
is
pressed
for
time
yet
he
is
so
continually
at
the
call
of
the
poor
that
people
begin
to
speak
of
him
as
the
poor
man
doctor
he
told
me
he
was
proud
of
that
at
this
point
the
musicians
were
appealed
to
to
come
to
the
front
parlor
and
gracie
had
opportunity
for
a
nearer
study
of
the
man
whom
she
could
not
help
but
admire
he
was
not
likely
to
suffer
from
a
nearer
view
at
least
not
while
gracie
was
in
the
mood
that
then
possessed
her
he
greeted
her
cordially
and
at
once
brought
her
into
the
conversation
by
appealing
to
her
for
a
decision
seeming
to
take
it
for
granted
that
she
was
of
the
same
spirit
with
himself
this
young
lady
was
taking
lessons
of
life
that
were
designed
to
be
helpful
to
her
if
she
would
but
let
them
a
thoroughly
and
cultured
gentleman
well
fitted
to
take
high
rank
in
society
not
in
the
ministry
and
yet
thoroughly
absorbed
in
what
she
had
hitherto
almost
unconsciously
set
down
as
ministers
work
was
a
mystery
to
her
moreover
for
the
second
time
that
evening
she
felt
a
curious
sense
of
satisfaction
in
being
classed
among
the
energetic
workers
of
the
world
the
pretty
who
had
lived
all
her
young
life
in
a
neighborhood
where
she
was
gracie
dennis
looked
up
to
indeed
by
her
set
and
having
a
decided
influence
of
her
own
yet
felt
it
to
be
a
novel
experience
to
hear
herself
addressed
in
a
clear
firm
voice
after
this
manner
miss
dennis
what
means
would
you
advise
for
interesting
a
company
of
young
girls
in
reading
regularly
books
which
would
be
of
use
to
them
of
course
i
speak
of
a
class
of
girls
who
have
done
no
reading
of
any
account
heretofore
and
who
have
no
knowledge
in
the
it
is
something
about
which
i
have
not
thought
at
all
said
gracie
her
pretty
face
all
in
a
flush
but
i
should
suppose
the
way
would
be
to
take
one
girl
at
a
time
and
study
her
to
find
what
would
be
likely
to
interest
and
help
and
also
to
get
such
an
influence
over
her
that
she
would
read
what
i
wanted
her
first
catch
your
hare
eh
good
said
the
doctor
with
an
approving
glance
towards
roberts
the
longer
i
live
the
more
convinced
am
i
that
individual
effort
is
what
accomplishes
the
great
things
in
this
there
was
more
talk
about
this
and
kindred
matters
and
gracie
found
herself
drawn
out
and
her
interest
excited
on
themes
about
which
she
had
supposed
she
knew
nothing
then
occurred
an
interruption
a
ringing
of
the
for
miss
dennis
said
the
messenger
but
she
handed
the
card
to
roberts
there
was
just
a
moment
of
hesitation
while
that
lady
apparently
studied
the
name
then
she
said
composedly
this
is
professor
ellis
gracie
do
you
wish
to
receive
him
this
evening
since
i
have
known
roberts
well
i
have
studied
her
innocently
sincere
manner
with
not
a
little
curiosity
as
to
the
probable
effect
on
the
world
suppose
it
were
possible
for
others
to
adopt
her
method
the
actual
practical
effect
with
her
is
that
she
succeeds
often
in
wisely
deceiving
while
intending
to
be
perfectly
sincere
for
instance
her
question
to
gracie
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
during
which
she
asked
herself
what
ought
i
to
do
and
immediately
answered
herself
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
be
perfectly
her
question
was
intended
to
say
to
gracie
i
trust
you
what
your
father
has
directed
you
to
do
i
feel
sure
you
will
but
it
said
different
things
from
that
to
gracie
ever
since
she
had
been
told
that
she
might
make
her
old
acquaintance
flossy
a
visit
this
young
lady
had
been
suspicious
that
this
was
a
device
of
her
stepmother
to
get
pleasantly
rid
of
her
for
a
few
weeks
she
surmised
that
a
very
carefully
elaborate
account
of
her
sins
had
been
written
out
by
this
same
stepmother
for
the
benefit
of
her
young
hostess
and
that
special
directions
had
been
given
for
guarding
her
from
the
wolf
professor
ellis
she
would
have
spoiled
the
entire
scheme
by
haughtily
refusing
to
leave
home
had
not
the
innocent
delight
of
a
young
girl
over
the
thought
of
visiting
a
beautiful
strange
city
gotten
the
better
of
her
pride
the
question
of
her
hostess
disarmed
a
whole
nest
of
suspicions
it
was
hardly
possible
that
it
had
been
hinted
to
flossy
that
her
guest
might
attempt
to
elope
with
this
man
else
she
would
not
with
serene
face
be
asking
whether
it
was
her
wish
to
receive
him
if
you
please
she
made
haste
to
answer
her
cheeks
glowing
the
while
and
roberts
gave
instant
direction
that
the
gentleman
be
shown
to
the
parlor
there
were
several
new
lessons
set
for
miss
gracie
dennis
to
learn
that
evening
one
was
that
professor
ellis
with
his
faultless
dress
and
excessive
politeness
his
finished
bows
and
smiles
that
would
have
done
credit
to
any
in
the
land
his
accurate
knowledge
of
all
the
printed
rules
of
etiquette
yet
in
roberts
parlor
contrasted
with
everett
and
even
with
young
ried
the
clerk
appeared
at
a
disadvantage
she
was
slow
in
learning
the
lesson
on
that
first
evening
she
simply
stared
at
it
in
bewilderment
what
did
it
mean
there
was
an
attempt
to
draw
the
professor
into
the
circle
to
continue
the
conversation
that
had
been
so
animated
and
interesting
before
his
entrance
the
effect
was
much
like
that
produced
in
striking
a
discordant
note
in
a
hitherto
faultless
piece
of
music
young
men
out
of
business
needing
help
needing
an
encouraging
word
an
hand
professor
ellis
had
words
and
hands
but
he
might
have
been
without
either
for
all
the
help
they
gave
him
in
responding
to
efforts
like
these
books
to
help
uplift
the
young
to
give
them
high
ideas
of
life
to
enthuse
them
with
desires
to
live
for
a
purpose
truly
he
could
only
stare
blankly
at
the
suggestion
what
did
he
know
of
books
written
for
such
purposes
yet
gracie
had
supposed
him
to
be
literary
in
his
tastes
and
pursuits
certainly
he
read
french
yes
french
novels
he
was
quite
familiar
with
some
of
such
a
character
that
had
gracie
been
a
good
french
scholar
and
ever
likely
to
come
in
contact
with
a
copy
of
them
he
would
not
have
dared
to
mention
their
names
in
her
presence
more
than
once
of
late
had
the
stepmother
wished
that
her
young
daughter
understood
the
language
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
the
man
whom
she
admired
used
frequently
french
oaths
but
alas
for
gracie
when
he
had
so
poisoned
her
mother
influence
over
this
dangerously
pretty
girl
that
she
would
have
believed
his
word
at
any
time
rather
than
that
mother
well
he
read
other
than
french
novels
charles
reade
for
instance
and
some
of
the
more
recent
authors
fashionable
in
certain
circles
it
is
true
that
gracie
was
not
acquainted
with
them
that
her
father
would
not
allow
a
copy
of
their
books
to
come
freely
into
his
home
and
gracie
was
much
too
honorable
to
read
them
in
private
but
it
is
also
true
that
while
professing
to
admire
this
trait
in
her
as
charming
in
a
young
daughter
the
professor
had
also
pityingly
and
gently
told
this
young
daughter
that
these
things
were
her
father
concessions
to
the
narrow
age
and
trammelled
profession
to
which
he
belonged
that
the
fact
was
free
thought
was
discouraged
because
there
was
that
in
every
church
which
would
not
bear
its
light
that
her
wise
father
was
one
of
a
hundred
in
recognizing
this
and
trying
to
shield
her
while
she
was
young
you
are
also
to
remember
that
she
young
and
therefore
forgive
her
that
she
did
not
detect
the
contradictory
sophistry
in
the
words
he
really
understood
how
to
poison
as
well
as
any
man
of
his
stamp
could
chapter
xvi
here
was
his
but
the
question
which
would
keep
forcing
itself
on
gracie
dennis
was
this
if
he
really
knows
of
nice
books
full
of
beautiful
and
ennobling
that
would
enlighten
the
race
as
he
has
often
told
me
why
does
he
mention
some
of
them
now
there
is
no
minister
here
by
long
years
of
narrowing
education
how
does
he
know
but
that
these
people
are
as
in
their
ideas
as
he
is
himself
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
conscious
of
thinking
these
thoughts
but
that
they
hovered
on
the
edge
as
it
were
of
her
mind
making
her
feel
ill
at
ease
everett
on
his
part
seemed
courteously
bent
on
securing
an
expression
of
the
professor
opinion
about
matters
of
which
he
either
could
not
or
would
not
talk
when
at
last
the
disturbed
gentleman
resolved
to
violate
what
gracie
was
sure
was
a
law
of
good
breeding
and
address
her
in
french
what
with
her
embarrassment
lest
others
should
understand
and
her
own
marked
ignorance
of
the
language
she
found
great
difficulty
in
making
a
free
translation
upon
my
word
i
wish
you
understood
french
or
some
other
tongue
so
that
we
could
escape
from
this
boredom
does
the
poor
little
prisoner
have
much
of
this
to
endure
can
not
we
escape
to
the
and
talk
things
over
gracie
cast
a
frightened
glance
about
her
to
see
if
there
were
others
who
understood
better
than
herself
this
sentence
which
for
aught
she
knew
might
contain
something
startling
but
alfred
was
busily
engaged
in
looking
up
the
name
of
a
book
which
he
had
vainly
tried
to
recall
and
everett
was
apparently
serenely
oblivious
to
any
language
but
his
very
soon
after
this
gracie
managed
to
escape
with
her
caller
to
the
music
alcove
thus
much
of
the
french
she
had
understood
and
at
least
professor
ellis
could
play
which
fact
she
resolved
that
the
people
in
the
front
parlor
should
speedily
understand
ah
but
he
could
play
and
herein
lay
one
of
his
strong
fascinations
for
the
girl
for
a
time
the
most
ravishing
strains
rolled
through
the
parlor
hushing
into
rapt
attention
the
group
gathered
there
who
had
just
been
reinforced
by
the
coming
of
roberts
by
degrees
the
strains
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
as
the
professor
still
on
the
bent
over
gracie
seated
in
a
low
chair
and
apparently
found
fluent
speech
at
last
roberts
meantime
was
ill
at
ease
what
would
dennis
and
marion
say
could
they
have
a
peep
at
this
moment
into
her
back
parlor
was
she
being
faithful
to
her
trust
yet
what
was
there
she
could
do
she
tried
to
sustain
her
part
in
the
conversation
but
her
troubled
gaze
constantly
wandering
elsewhere
betrayed
her
everett
keen
eyes
were
upon
her
are
you
particularly
interested
in
that
man
he
asked
abruptly
roberts
smiled
faintly
i
am
particularly
interested
in
that
girl
she
said
how
do
you
like
her
present
companionship
not
at
all
she
answered
quickly
whereupon
roberts
began
to
question
may
i
know
doctor
whether
you
have
any
other
reason
than
that
of
intuition
for
asking
the
question
possibly
not
said
the
doctor
guardedly
it
maybe
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
roberts
would
you
like
to
have
me
investigate
something
that
may
be
to
his
disadvantage
roberts
had
a
prompt
answer
ready
there
are
reasons
why
it
is
specially
important
that
such
an
investigation
should
be
made
and
reported
to
me
may
i
commission
you
the
doctor
bowed
and
the
subject
of
professor
ellis
was
immediately
dropped
during
the
following
week
certain
innovations
took
place
in
roberts
household
at
the
end
of
the
conservatory
was
a
long
bright
and
hitherto
unfurnished
room
it
had
been
designed
as
a
sort
of
second
conservatory
whenever
the
beauties
of
that
department
should
outgrow
their
present
bounds
but
meantime
other
plants
had
taken
root
and
blossomed
in
the
mistress
heart
early
in
this
week
the
unused
room
had
been
opened
and
cleaned
then
began
to
arrive
packages
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
a
roll
of
carpeting
and
two
young
men
from
the
carpet
store
and
there
followed
soon
after
the
sound
of
hammering
halted
before
the
door
leaving
their
burdens
men
and
women
flitted
to
and
fro
busy
and
important
it
was
saturday
night
before
roberts
and
his
young
clerk
were
invited
in
to
admire
and
criticise
the
new
room
roberts
at
least
was
prepared
to
appreciate
its
transformation
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
heavy
carpet
in
lovely
shades
of
mossy
green
and
easy
chairs
and
couches
in
tints
that
either
matched
or
made
delightful
contrasts
with
the
carpet
abounded
the
walls
were
hung
with
pictures
and
charts
and
maps
a
occupied
the
centre
of
the
room
one
of
those
charming
tables
full
of
mysterious
drawers
and
unexpected
corners
paper
and
pens
and
inks
in
various
colors
were
disposed
about
this
table
in
delightful
profusion
other
tables
plenty
of
them
small
and
neat
each
of
a
different
shape
or
design
were
stationed
at
intervals
in
convenient
proximity
to
comfortable
chairs
nothing
could
be
further
removed
from
one
idea
of
a
than
was
that
long
beautiful
parlor
yet
when
you
thought
of
it
and
took
a
second
deliberate
survey
nothing
that
could
have
contributed
to
the
enjoyment
of
pupils
was
missing
a
small
cabinet
organ
occupied
an
alcove
and
of
various
grades
were
strewn
over
it
toward
this
spot
roberts
smiled
significantly
as
her
eye
caught
alfred
ried
and
she
said
i
have
visions
of
sacred
sabbath
evening
connected
with
this
corner
one
of
these
days
meantime
is
this
a
pleasant
room
for
our
monday
evenings
but
alfred
could
not
answer
her
his
head
was
turned
away
and
there
was
a
suspicious
lump
in
his
throat
that
made
him
know
better
than
to
attempt
speech
he
was
standing
at
that
moment
under
one
of
the
that
the
gaslight
illumined
until
it
glowed
and
the
words
stood
out
with
startling
clearness
let
us
not
sleep
as
do
others
but
let
us
watch
and
be
his
sister
text
one
that
perhaps
more
than
any
other
was
on
her
lips
when
she
talked
with
him
one
that
hung
at
her
coffin
head
when
he
a
little
boy
stood
beside
the
coffin
and
looked
down
at
her
face
and
looked
up
at
that
text
and
took
a
mental
photograph
of
both
to
live
in
his
heart
forever
this
is
your
special
chair
roberts
said
smiling
up
at
him
and
he
understood
her
here
was
his
opportunity
to
live
out
that
text
for
his
sister
would
he
try
well
said
gracie
drawing
a
long
breath
as
a
study
it
is
certainly
a
success
one
can
easily
see
flossy
why
you
were
born
with
the
ability
to
tell
at
a
glance
what
colors
harmonized
and
just
where
things
fitted
in
i
ca
imagine
anything
prettier
than
this
and
i
can
not
imagine
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
whereupon
they
sat
down
to
talk
that
important
question
over
what
they
were
going
to
try
to
do
sometimes
i
have
wondered
whether
ester
from
her
beautiful
home
could
look
down
on
it
all
and
whether
she
smiled
over
the
fact
that
her
work
was
doing
so
much
more
than
she
had
planned
she
had
roused
in
her
little
brother
an
ambition
that
had
grown
with
his
years
and
that
had
helped
to
hold
him
away
from
many
temptations
so
much
doubtless
she
had
foreseen
but
what
a
blessed
thing
it
was
that
she
had
touched
in
those
long
ago
years
influences
which
had
drawn
her
brother
in
his
young
and
perilous
manhood
into
intimate
relations
with
such
people
as
and
roberts
so
that
they
sat
down
familiarly
to
talk
over
mutual
interests
but
for
ester
words
spoken
long
ago
but
for
her
strong
desires
transmitted
to
him
he
might
have
sat
with
a
very
different
circle
and
talked
over
widely
different
schemes
on
the
edge
of
this
circle
gracie
dennis
hovered
she
could
not
but
be
interested
in
their
talk
for
she
was
a
christian
and
her
father
was
a
christian
and
she
had
all
her
life
breathed
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
christian
home
at
the
same
time
she
could
but
imagine
some
of
their
ideas
wild
ones
for
she
had
never
been
associated
with
people
who
widely
overstepped
the
conventional
ways
of
doing
things
and
she
had
of
late
been
much
with
professor
ellis
who
had
a
sort
of
gentlemanly
sneer
for
every
phase
of
christian
work
and
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
believed
in
nothing
he
had
not
been
outspoken
it
is
true
and
herein
lay
one
of
the
dangers
he
was
too
skillful
to
be
outspoken
but
the
subtle
poison
had
been
working
and
although
gracie
could
not
help
being
interested
in
those
queer
boys
she
could
not
help
thinking
flossy
whole
scheme
exceedingly
visionary
and
expected
it
to
come
to
grief
the
puzzling
question
was
why
did
roberts
being
a
man
permit
it
all
or
was
he
so
much
in
love
with
flossy
that
he
could
not
bear
to
thwart
even
her
wildest
flights
it
was
strange
too
to
see
a
young
man
like
alfred
ried
so
absorbed
his
sister
must
have
had
wonderful
power
over
him
gracie
thought
she
went
back
to
his
sister
influence
always
in
trying
to
explain
the
matter
and
never
gave
a
thought
to
christ
influence
meantime
she
listened
to
the
various
plans
proposed
for
the
first
monday
evening
and
was
sufficiently
interested
to
gather
her
pretty
face
in
a
frown
when
the
distant
peal
from
the
sounded
through
the
house
what
a
pity
to
be
interrupted
by
a
caller
she
exclaimed
this
room
is
so
much
nicer
than
the
parlor
flossy
do
you
hope
it
is
some
one
to
see
roberts
on
business
no
said
roberts
shaking
her
head
with
a
smile
i
feel
in
special
need
of
roberts
just
now
evan
i
really
think
we
must
be
excused
to
callers
for
this
one
evening
there
are
so
many
things
to
let
us
wait
and
see
answered
roberts
perhaps
the
lord
sent
the
caller
here
to
help
us
or
to
be
at
that
moment
came
the
card
oh
it
is
everett
was
roberts
exclamation
let
us
have
him
come
directly
here
evan
please
go
and
escort
him
you
were
right
the
lord
has
sent
him
to
help
us
i
do
know
how
i
sure
but
he
is
just
the
man
to
help
and
the
circle
instantly
widened
itself
to
receive
everett
it
took
almost
no
time
to
speak
the
commonplace
of
the
occasion
and
get
back
at
once
to
the
business
of
the
hour
it
was
evident
that
everett
needed
no
lengthy
explanations
and
there
was
apparently
nothing
bewildering
to
his
mind
in
the
plan
true
it
was
new
to
him
but
he
seemed
to
spring
at
once
to
the
centre
of
their
thoughts
his
eyes
glowed
for
a
moment
and
he
said
with
peculiar
emphasis
ried
when
the
son
of
man
cometh
he
will
surely
find
faith
on
the
earth
then
he
gave
himself
to
intensest
listening
and
questioning
and
presently
followed
his
questions
with
suggestions
which
showed
that
unconventional
ways
of
working
were
not
altogether
new
to
him
as
for
gracie
she
had
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
listen
intelligently
she
almost
caught
her
breath
over
the
rapidity
with
which
the
talkers
moved
from
one
scheme
to
another
all
the
time
there
was
a
curious
process
of
comparison
between
this
man
and
professor
ellis
going
on
in
her
mind
not
that
she
wished
to
compare
the
two
she
told
herself
that
it
was
absurd
to
do
so
none
the
less
she
did
it
for
instance
she
reminded
herself
that
she
had
mentally
assented
promptly
to
the
suggestion
of
inviting
the
doctor
to
this
room
to
talk
this
strange
scheme
over
she
had
recognized
the
fitness
of
the
act
but
suppose
professor
ellis
should
call
would
it
not
be
simply
absurd
to
think
of
explaining
to
him
the
uses
of
this
unique
room
who
would
for
a
moment
think
of
suggesting
his
name
as
a
helper
i
do
not
know
how
to
describe
to
you
the
appearance
of
that
room
on
monday
evening
when
the
boys
were
in
it
i
do
not
know
whether
the
sight
to
you
would
have
been
pitiful
or
ludicrous
how
can
i
tell
not
knowing
you
there
was
a
dreadful
incongruity
between
the
soiled
ragged
clothes
and
matted
hair
and
unwashed
hands
and
the
exquisite
purity
which
prevailed
around
them
of
course
you
could
have
seen
that
but
the
question
the
answer
to
which
would
have
stamped
your
place
in
the
world
workshop
would
have
been
do
you
see
any
further
than
that
and
seeing
further
which
way
do
you
see
the
possibilities
or
the
certainties
of
failure
oh
no
i
am
wrong
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
tell
where
you
belong
everett
saw
the
possibilities
and
gloried
in
them
gracie
dennis
thought
she
saw
the
certainty
of
failure
and
was
sorry
for
it
but
professor
ellis
would
have
seen
the
certainty
of
failure
and
would
have
met
it
with
a
sneer
if
he
had
not
been
too
indifferent
even
for
that
as
for
roberts
did
she
or
did
she
not
represent
a
different
and
higher
type
than
any
of
the
others
she
thought
not
much
about
either
success
or
failure
but
pushed
steadily
forward
the
plan
that
she
believed
she
had
gotten
on
her
knees
born
of
the
spirit
if
it
really
were
of
god
nothing
could
make
it
fail
but
if
she
mistook
and
the
plan
was
only
hers
mere
failure
in
that
direction
would
signify
nothing
she
would
have
but
to
try
again
something
of
this
she
felt
but
did
not
reason
out
for
she
was
no
logician
what
the
boys
saw
was
a
great
splendid
room
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
for
they
recognized
without
being
able
to
explain
the
difference
between
it
and
the
parlors
and
felt
freer
in
it
they
all
came
and
they
looked
not
one
whit
better
than
on
the
monday
evening
before
over
this
fact
gracie
dennis
with
all
her
public
scoffing
was
in
private
a
little
disappointed
it
is
true
she
had
not
expected
to
see
them
again
but
if
they
came
she
thought
it
possible
that
they
might
have
been
tempted
to
appear
with
clean
hands
and
faces
possibly
some
were
so
tempted
and
but
for
the
difficulties
in
the
way
might
really
have
tried
for
this
but
gracie
was
not
sufficiently
enlightened
to
dream
of
difficulties
in
the
way
of
simply
washing
one
face
and
hands
during
the
saturday
evening
conference
it
had
been
decided
that
roberts
must
make
acquaintance
with
his
guests
it
would
never
do
to
have
them
come
familiarly
to
his
house
and
he
not
be
able
to
recognize
them
on
the
streets
several
plans
were
suggested
for
introducing
him
skilfully
to
them
but
he
disapproved
of
them
all
no
he
said
i
tell
you
what
we
do
i
will
introduce
myself
you
may
receive
them
flossy
and
then
retire
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
let
myself
in
by
the
conservatory
passage
and
make
myself
acquainted
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
in
ten
minutes
flossy
give
you
leave
to
return
as
for
the
rest
of
you
do
dare
to
venture
in
until
i
have
made
good
my
claim
as
the
head
of
the
house
i
am
jealous
of
you
to
this
plan
roberts
readily
assented
but
the
young
clerk
looked
doubtful
in
common
with
the
rest
of
his
employees
he
stood
in
wholesome
awe
of
the
thorough
business
man
who
seemed
to
know
as
by
a
sort
of
instinct
when
anything
in
any
department
of
the
great
store
was
not
moving
according
to
rule
his
knowledge
of
roberts
outside
of
the
store
was
limited
and
he
expected
to
find
the
boys
if
not
frightened
so
awed
that
they
would
resolve
never
to
be
caught
inside
that
room
again
however
he
of
course
only
looked
his
fears
he
was
too
much
afraid
of
the
great
merchant
to
express
them
and
it
had
been
understood
when
they
separated
that
this
plan
was
to
be
carried
out
chapter
xvii
i
wonder
what
they
all
after
in
the
library
waited
gracie
and
ried
while
roberts
went
merrily
to
see
whether
the
boys
or
their
host
had
proved
the
stronger
i
do
believe
this
part
of
the
programme
will
work
alfred
said
confidently
the
moment
the
door
closed
after
roberts
those
fellows
will
all
be
afraid
of
roberts
and
we
shall
lose
what
little
hold
we
have
on
they
do
look
to
me
as
though
it
ever
occurred
to
them
to
be
afraid
of
anything
gracie
said
but
alfred
ried
who
had
studied
deeper
into
this
problem
of
the
different
classes
of
society
was
ready
with
his
answer
yes
they
are
they
can
be
awed
and
made
to
feel
uncomfortable
to
the
degree
that
they
will
resolve
not
to
appear
in
that
region
again
one
can
not
judge
from
their
behavior
in
some
way
they
recognize
a
mission
school
as
being
in
a
sense
their
property
and
behave
accordingly
but
in
a
man
own
house
surrounded
by
things
of
which
they
do
not
even
know
the
name
he
has
them
at
a
disadvantage
and
can
easily
rouse
within
them
the
feeling
that
they
are
than
which
there
is
nothing
those
fellows
dread
so
much
i
but
they
were
not
afraid
of
flossy
last
week
even
surrounded
by
the
elegances
of
her
parlors
and
ah
he
said
his
eyes
alight
she
has
a
wisdom
born
of
god
i
think
for
managing
these
and
all
other
concerns
she
is
unlike
everybody
whereupon
gracie
dennis
laughed
not
a
disagreeable
laugh
but
there
came
to
her
just
then
a
sense
of
the
strangeness
of
thinking
that
pretty
flossy
shipley
whom
she
had
known
all
her
life
and
from
the
heights
of
her
childhood
because
she
was
a
silly
little
thing
who
could
not
do
her
problems
in
class
should
have
a
wisdom
unlike
any
others
yet
almost
immediately
her
laugh
was
stayed
because
the
change
in
flossy
was
so
great
that
she
too
recognized
it
as
born
of
god
sometimes
it
came
with
force
to
this
proud
young
girl
that
if
god
could
do
so
much
for
flossy
what
might
he
not
be
willing
to
do
with
those
whom
he
had
made
intellectually
her
superior
if
they
were
but
ready
to
be
led
the
young
man
who
was
studying
her
watched
the
grave
look
deepen
on
her
face
and
wondered
at
its
source
what
a
pretty
face
it
was
oh
much
more
than
pretty
there
was
great
strength
in
it
and
sweetness
too
of
a
certain
sort
but
he
could
not
help
comparing
the
sort
with
that
in
some
other
faces
and
he
wondered
over
the
difference
this
young
lady
was
a
christian
why
should
her
christian
experience
stamp
her
with
such
a
different
expression
from
that
which
others
wore
he
always
finished
this
sort
of
sentence
with
a
blank
space
first
as
though
he
did
not
choose
to
have
himself
tell
himself
any
names
yet
he
spoke
a
name
forcibly
enough
still
gazing
earnestly
at
gracie
did
you
ever
meet
miss
joy
saunders
gracie
turned
toward
him
a
laughing
face
no
but
we
are
very
anxious
to
flossy
and
i
we
have
both
been
told
that
we
ought
to
know
her
and
told
so
earnestly
that
we
really
think
we
ought
who
is
she
is
she
too
unlike
anybody
else
very
he
said
promptly
i
know
her
very
little
she
is
the
daughter
of
our
landlady
i
meet
her
in
the
hall
on
rare
occasions
and
sometimes
catch
glimpses
of
her
just
vanishing
from
some
room
as
i
enter
but
as
for
being
acquainted
with
her
i
suppose
i
am
not
i
think
though
of
that
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
she
is
engaged
to
everett
oh
then
of
course
he
would
think
naturally
that
people
ought
to
know
her
what
is
she
like
like
nothing
said
alfred
with
great
promptness
did
you
ever
know
a
person
named
joy
no
what
a
singular
well
it
fits
she
is
very
far
removed
from
mirth
and
she
is
not
what
people
call
gay
and
she
is
not
outspoken
apparently
at
any
time
though
as
i
say
i
do
not
know
her
but
there
is
something
in
her
face
that
fits
the
name
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
sometimes
i
think
it
is
the
shining
of
christ
face
reflected
in
her
but
the
puzzle
is
why
do
not
other
faces
have
it
faces
which
belong
to
him
perhaps
there
is
a
difference
in
the
degree
of
gracie
spoke
the
words
very
gently
wondering
meanwhile
at
the
way
in
which
this
thought
chimed
in
with
hers
about
flossy
oh
there
is
but
why
should
there
be
if
i
belong
to
christ
i
do
i
there
is
no
service
possible
why
do
i
not
so
look
that
others
take
knowledge
of
me
that
i
have
been
with
jesus
how
do
you
know
but
they
do
ah
i
know
i
know
too
well
they
are
more
likely
a
great
deal
to
take
knowledge
that
i
have
been
with
satan
i
feel
the
frown
all
over
my
face
a
great
deal
of
the
time
and
the
world
goes
astray
a
great
many
times
when
i
suppose
it
is
just
myself
that
is
wrong
but
miss
dennis
i
hunger
for
the
shining
of
his
face
in
that
must
be
the
meaning
of
the
beatitude
which
puzzled
my
childhood
she
answered
trying
to
speak
lightly
to
hide
feelings
that
were
deeply
moved
blessed
are
they
which
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
for
they
shall
be
thank
you
he
said
smiling
there
is
actually
a
promise
i
had
not
thought
of
it
and
yet
the
thoughtful
frown
gathering
almost
immediately
do
you
suppose
that
a
person
who
really
hungered
for
a
certain
thing
could
be
satisfied
with
anything
else
i
often
have
an
hour
of
what
at
the
moment
seems
to
me
like
hunger
for
him
but
the
hour
passes
and
i
get
filled
with
business
or
with
plans
or
possibly
with
annoyances
and
feel
nothing
but
a
general
irritation
for
everybody
do
you
think
there
can
be
anything
genuine
about
such
desires
so
easily
turned
aside
oh
i
do
not
know
said
gracie
hastily
why
do
you
ask
me
such
things
did
not
i
tell
you
i
was
not
good
ask
those
people
who
are
unlike
all
others
why
do
you
ask
this
joy
she
could
tell
you
i
presume
i
can
tell
you
nothing
save
that
this
is
a
very
strange
world
not
half
so
nice
as
i
once
thought
it
and
i
do
like
to
think
about
how
he
was
from
other
young
men
with
whom
she
had
spent
fifteen
minutes
many
a
time
in
gay
banter
this
was
after
all
the
thought
uppermost
in
her
mind
at
the
moment
nice
christian
men
of
whom
her
father
spoke
well
and
who
people
said
were
young
men
to
be
proud
of
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
knew
them
by
the
dozens
yet
with
which
one
of
them
had
she
ever
carried
on
such
a
conversation
as
this
with
which
one
could
she
have
attempted
any
thing
of
the
kind
without
leading
him
to
suppose
that
she
was
taking
leave
of
her
senses
she
recalled
some
of
the
gay
words
that
she
had
spoken
with
these
others
and
tried
hurriedly
to
decide
why
it
would
sound
to
her
perfectly
absurd
to
talk
with
alfred
ried
in
that
way
however
she
did
not
want
to
talk
with
him
he
was
too
full
of
questionings
and
questions
said
poor
gracie
are
all
that
i
can
ask
myself
i
want
somebody
to
talk
with
who
is
assured
of
the
ground
on
which
he
stands
and
can
tell
me
why
he
stands
there
was
not
time
for
further
talk
they
were
summoned
to
the
new
room
bursts
of
laughter
greeted
their
ears
as
they
made
their
way
eagerly
across
the
hall
and
gracie
took
time
to
remark
that
the
boys
were
certainly
not
awed
into
silence
before
the
opening
door
let
them
into
the
scene
every
boy
was
laughing
not
quietly
but
immoderately
and
the
centre
of
attraction
was
evidently
roberts
i
have
been
giving
our
friends
an
account
of
an
old
army
experience
he
said
in
explanation
to
gracie
and
we
have
been
enjoying
a
laugh
together
over
the
old
memory
you
are
all
acquainted
with
miss
dennis
i
think
young
gentlemen
clearly
there
was
no
need
for
any
one
to
introduce
roberts
to
the
boys
apparently
they
knew
him
now
better
than
they
did
any
of
the
others
yet
as
gracie
after
shaking
hands
with
each
of
the
guests
took
a
vacant
seat
by
nimble
dick
she
was
greeted
with
a
confidential
whisper
that
a
jolly
chap
as
ever
i
saw
and
i
never
heard
anything
to
beat
the
yarn
he
told
us
for
cuteness
who
is
he
why
he
is
evan
roberts
the
owner
of
this
my
eyes
said
dick
gazing
about
him
in
a
startled
way
look
here
he
ai
that
roberts
from
the
big
store
on
fourth
street
yes
he
is
he
is
one
of
the
partners
in
that
then
did
nimble
dick
give
a
low
whistle
suddenly
cut
short
as
the
other
boys
looked
at
him
and
sat
up
straight
in
his
chair
and
for
at
least
a
minute
was
awed
or
else
was
bewildered
if
his
mind
could
have
been
looked
into
for
a
moment
something
like
this
might
have
been
seen
there
and
here
i
am
sittin
in
one
of
his
chairs
and
been
laughin
to
kill
over
his
funny
story
if
this
ai
the
greatest
lark
out
i
wonder
what
they
all
after
anyhow
then
the
real
business
of
the
evening
commenced
i
should
like
to
describe
that
evening
but
it
is
really
worse
to
describe
than
the
boys
it
was
designed
to
be
one
of
those
most
difficult
evenings
where
every
act
and
almost
every
word
has
been
previously
arranged
but
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
appear
like
an
impromptu
effort
the
result
of
merely
the
happenings
of
the
hour
for
instance
roberts
aimed
at
nothing
less
formidable
than
the
teaching
of
these
boys
to
read
and
write
and
know
as
well
as
ever
i
know
it
that
to
frankly
own
that
she
was
ready
and
willing
to
give
her
time
and
patience
in
so
teaching
them
would
be
to
outwit
herself
they
did
not
belong
to
the
class
who
can
be
beguiled
into
evening
schools
there
are
such
mark
calkins
would
have
seized
such
an
opportunity
and
rejoiced
over
it
but
these
were
lower
in
the
scale
they
did
not
realize
their
need
and
they
had
what
they
in
ignorance
called
independence
they
were
not
to
be
trapped
by
evening
schools
therefore
it
required
diplomacy
and
no
people
can
be
more
diplomatic
on
occasion
than
certain
most
little
women
roberts
had
studied
her
way
step
by
step
therefore
it
was
that
by
the
most
natural
passage
possible
she
led
the
way
to
a
discussion
of
different
styles
of
writing
bringing
forth
to
aid
her
a
certain
old
autograph
album
which
had
been
to
many
places
of
note
among
others
chautauqua
and
had
the
names
of
distinguished
persons
as
well
as
of
many
who
were
not
distinguished
except
for
christian
endurance
in
consenting
to
write
in
an
autograph
album
good
writers
were
talked
about
and
selected
and
poor
writers
were
talked
about
and
it
was
said
by
some
one
accidentally
of
course
that
a
good
hand
was
really
an
accomplishment
it
is
more
than
that
declared
roberts
a
man
business
life
often
turns
on
it
i
have
myself
had
to
turn
away
from
several
otherwise
suitable
helpers
in
our
business
because
they
really
could
not
write
a
good
clear
hand
that
could
be
read
without
are
you
a
good
writer
miss
gracie
this
remark
coming
suddenly
to
gracie
from
her
host
almost
embarrassed
her
for
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
very
words
by
which
these
themes
should
be
introduced
had
been
planned
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
gracie
that
so
personal
a
question
might
be
asked
her
but
she
rallied
quickly
no
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
am
not
i
write
what
papa
calls
a
mincing
hand
all
jumbled
up
together
you
know
or
running
into
each
other
the
letters
are
and
so
difficult
to
read
that
papa
said
when
i
came
away
he
hoped
i
would
call
on
his
friend
stuart
every
day
and
write
a
letter
on
his
what
is
that
interrupted
nimble
dick
his
face
curious
what
a
oh
it
is
a
strange
little
machine
used
instead
of
the
pen
at
least
a
very
few
people
use
it
it
is
quite
new
i
think
and
must
be
very
curious
i
never
saw
one
but
the
writing
looks
just
like
print
stuart
a
pastor
in
the
city
is
my
papa
friend
and
writes
to
him
on
his
and
papa
reads
the
letter
with
great
satisfaction
saying
to
me
daughter
that
is
something
like
people
who
can
not
write
well
enough
for
others
to
read
should
print
they
are
not
so
very
uncommon
miss
dennis
explained
everett
who
saw
the
eagerness
on
nimble
dick
face
it
is
a
comparatively
new
invention
but
is
being
caught
up
very
promptly
i
think
nearly
all
the
leading
lawyers
use
them
and
those
who
do
not
own
them
are
getting
their
copying
done
at
the
rooms
they
are
very
ingenious
little
did
you
say
you
never
saw
one
this
question
from
roberts
to
gracie
and
he
added
mrs
roberts
i
believe
you
have
never
had
other
than
the
first
glimpse
i
showed
you
in
the
parker
building
i
have
an
idea
suppose
i
rent
one
of
the
little
fellows
to
interest
us
it
would
be
pleasant
to
look
into
it
and
see
how
it
works
did
none
of
you
ever
see
one
well
now
try
for
that
on
next
monday
evening
i
have
one
sent
up
and
miss
gracie
we
appoint
you
showman
for
the
following
monday
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
you
will
employ
your
leisure
in
learning
how
to
manage
the
creature
and
perhaps
send
your
father
a
readable
letter
at
the
same
now
as
may
readily
be
supposed
all
this
about
machinery
had
not
been
arranged
for
beforehand
but
was
a
side
issue
born
of
the
fact
that
the
watchful
servant
of
his
master
saw
an
eager
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
boy
dick
directly
there
was
anything
said
that
suggested
machinery
one
of
the
great
aims
of
these
evenings
was
to
study
character
however
developed
having
turned
his
company
from
the
regular
channel
roberts
made
haste
to
put
them
skilfully
back
where
they
were
before
still
it
would
be
a
pity
to
resort
to
machinery
simply
because
one
did
not
know
how
to
write
well
i
would
rather
set
to
work
to
correct
the
error
i
happen
to
know
one
of
our
number
who
can
write
a
very
enviable
hand
do
you
know
ried
that
the
letter
you
wrote
me
was
the
first
thing
which
attracted
me
to
you
i
remember
i
showed
the
note
to
one
of
our
senior
partners
who
was
particularly
disturbed
by
poor
writing
and
he
said
him
roberts
do
a
young
man
who
can
write
like
that
will
be
a
relief
roberts
i
move
you
that
we
resolve
ourselves
at
this
moment
into
a
to
be
taught
by
ried
my
dear
sir
will
you
take
us
in
hand
something
of
this
kind
had
been
planned
at
least
it
had
been
planned
that
ried
should
be
asked
to
do
this
thing
but
he
found
the
actual
asking
embarrassing
and
struggled
with
it
with
flushing
cheeks
gracie
came
to
his
aid
i
do
know
whether
i
take
lessons
or
not
who
wants
to
expose
one
ignorance
will
you
teach
must
we
each
give
a
specimen
of
our
present
attainments
instantly
ried
divined
the
reason
for
the
question
no
he
said
eagerly
oh
no
i
should
begin
with
those
horrors
of
your
childhood
pothooks
or
something
of
that
sort
lines
and
curves
you
know
there
are
not
many
of
them
after
all
in
our
letters
and
when
once
a
person
has
conquered
them
it
is
easy
to
put
them
there
was
more
talk
easy
and
social
and
roberts
the
doctor
and
gracie
seemed
equally
interested
in
the
project
and
questioned
young
ried
until
he
assured
them
that
he
began
to
feel
like
a
veritable
professor
apparently
the
boys
were
forgotten
this
very
fact
put
them
at
their
ease
and
they
listened
interested
and
amused
over
the
thought
that
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
wanted
to
go
to
school
at
first
i
do
not
think
it
occurred
to
one
of
them
that
he
was
included
in
the
proposal
to
form
an
how
was
it
done
i
am
not
sure
that
any
one
of
the
eager
group
of
workers
could
have
told
you
afterward
so
excited
did
they
become
over
this
first
scheme
nobody
could
remember
just
what
words
were
said
nor
who
said
them
nor
whether
the
boys
all
looked
equally
startled
when
paper
and
pen
were
put
into
each
hand
they
remembered
that
some
shook
their
heads
emphatically
and
that
nimble
dick
spoke
plainly
no
you
do
i
ca
write
any
more
than
a
duck
can
and
i
never
expect
roberts
knew
that
dirk
colson
dark
face
turned
a
fierce
red
and
he
snapped
the
offered
pen
across
the
table
with
his
indignant
thumb
and
finger
but
of
these
words
and
acts
nobody
apparently
took
any
notice
the
writing
began
and
the
first
marks
given
as
copies
were
so
simple
looked
so
easy
to
do
and
the
attempts
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
fell
so
far
short
of
what
the
teacher
desired
and
were
so
unmercifully
criticised
by
him
and
the
criticisms
were
so
merrily
received
by
the
writers
that
at
last
the
whole
thing
took
the
form
of
a
joke
to
nimble
dick
mind
and
he
became
possessed
with
a
burning
desire
to
try
one
by
one
the
boys
stealthily
followed
his
example
alfred
taking
care
to
watch
eagerly
to
commend
both
stephen
crowley
and
gracie
dennis
in
the
same
breath
for
some
true
stroke
and
criticise
both
roberts
and
nimble
dick
for
not
holding
the
pen
aright
the
entire
party
became
so
interested
that
only
roberts
knew
just
when
dirk
colson
stealthily
filliped
back
his
pen
from
the
distance
to
which
it
had
been
rolled
and
sitting
upright
that
he
might
attract
the
less
notice
tried
his
hand
on
the
curve
which
was
giving
even
everett
trouble
when
the
young
teacher
discovered
it
he
made
also
another
discovery
which
he
proclaimed
upon
my
word
i
beg
the
pardon
of
each
of
you
but
colson
here
has
made
the
only
respectable
there
is
in
the
then
if
his
sister
mart
had
seen
the
glow
on
dirk
face
i
am
not
sure
that
she
would
have
known
him
there
was
a
momentary
transformation
as
for
roberts
she
bowed
low
over
the
letter
she
was
carefully
forming
but
it
was
to
say
in
soft
whisper
heard
by
one
ear
alone
thank
god
chapter
xviii
yourn
the
way
you
are
not
to
suppose
because
this
first
monday
evening
which
by
the
way
was
concluded
with
sandwiches
and
coffee
was
a
success
pronounced
so
by
all
concerned
that
therefore
the
ones
which
followed
were
all
fortunately
not
one
of
the
workers
expected
this
and
so
were
brave
and
cheerful
under
drawbacks
these
were
numerous
and
varied
after
the
first
novelty
wore
off
it
took
at
times
only
the
most
trivial
excuses
to
keep
the
boys
away
sometimes
when
they
called
their
conduct
was
anything
but
encouraging
they
lolled
in
the
smelling
strongly
of
tobacco
and
other
odors
refused
insolently
to
apply
themselves
to
any
work
at
hand
audibly
pronounced
the
whole
thing
slow
and
in
numberless
ways
severely
tried
the
patience
of
both
alfred
and
gracie
for
the
others
they
had
counted
the
cost
at
least
the
gentlemen
had
and
expected
to
move
slowly
even
to
appear
to
go
backward
some
of
the
time
as
for
roberts
i
have
told
you
that
she
worked
in
a
peculiar
manner
with
the
motto
this
one
thing
i
do
apparently
ever
before
her
each
evening
was
distinct
in
itself
with
efforts
to
make
and
obstacles
to
overcome
and
at
its
close
she
had
a
way
of
laying
it
aside
as
something
with
which
her
part
was
done
not
attempting
even
to
calculate
results
then
she
was
ready
to
turn
to
a
new
day
and
work
steadily
for
that
the
winter
was
slipping
away
and
gracie
dennis
lingered
she
could
hardly
have
told
you
why
yet
there
were
many
apparent
reasons
roberts
wanted
her
rejoiced
in
her
and
coaxed
irresistibly
as
often
as
the
thought
of
going
home
was
mentioned
then
gracie
laugh
over
the
peculiar
work
going
on
as
she
might
was
undeniably
interested
in
those
boys
she
was
working
for
them
therefore
of
course
she
was
interested
i
do
see
how
you
can
go
this
week
would
young
ried
say
to
her
with
a
perplexed
air
you
know
we
have
that
matter
all
planned
for
next
monday
evening
how
can
we
carry
out
the
scheme
if
you
are
not
there
to
do
your
part
then
would
gracie
laugh
and
demur
and
admit
to
herself
only
that
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
needed
as
she
certainly
was
for
one
night
more
and
so
the
nights
passed
her
work
was
to
be
professor
of
elocution
as
roberts
gaily
called
her
when
the
workers
were
alone
together
it
had
been
discovered
that
she
could
read
both
prose
and
poetry
with
effect
so
a
was
organized
and
they
chose
for
the
first
evening
not
one
of
bryant
or
whittier
gems
nor
selections
from
milton
or
shakespeare
which
would
have
suited
part
of
the
company
nor
yet
the
easy
readings
in
some
standard
which
would
have
fitted
the
capacity
of
the
others
but
with
great
care
and
much
discussion
one
of
will
descriptive
poems
full
of
homely
yet
tender
language
full
of
pathos
and
of
humor
was
unanimously
selected
the
first
evening
reading
had
been
commenced
with
nuts
and
apples
there
are
those
who
can
see
no
connection
between
this
and
the
intellectual
happily
for
the
characters
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
roberts
was
not
one
of
them
while
the
others
were
still
enjoying
the
refreshments
she
took
the
book
and
read
this
was
her
quiet
little
sacrifice
it
was
not
pleasant
to
her
to
become
a
public
reader
it
required
courage
to
get
through
with
one
verse
with
everett
sitting
opposite
and
gracie
dennis
on
a
low
seat
at
her
side
and
her
husband
listening
intently
roberts
was
not
a
good
reader
and
was
aware
of
it
she
pronounced
the
words
correctly
it
is
true
but
when
you
had
said
that
you
had
said
all
that
there
was
to
offer
in
praise
of
her
effort
she
had
some
exasperating
faults
but
she
bravely
read
the
two
verses
and
some
of
the
boys
listened
and
one
of
them
laughed
he
had
caught
a
gleam
of
the
fun
in
the
poem
this
of
course
was
nimble
dick
then
alfred
ried
made
the
same
effort
on
the
same
verses
his
performance
was
very
little
better
and
he
too
knew
it
he
could
write
but
he
was
by
no
means
a
public
reader
this
was
his
offering
to
the
general
good
if
those
fellows
by
reason
of
his
mistakes
could
be
induced
to
climb
he
was
willing
to
offer
his
pride
on
the
altar
no
matter
by
what
petty
trials
they
were
caught
so
that
they
were
really
caught
then
followed
gracie
dennis
and
her
own
father
acceptable
preacher
though
he
was
might
with
credit
to
himself
have
taken
lessons
of
her
she
was
certainly
for
one
so
young
and
so
unprofessional
a
magnificent
reader
so
indeed
was
marion
wilbur
and
she
had
enjoyed
teaching
gracie
the
poem
blossomed
in
her
hand
the
crunching
of
nuts
and
apples
entirely
ceased
the
boys
sat
erect
and
listened
and
laughed
and
flushed
and
swallowed
suspiciously
over
some
of
the
homely
pathos
they
had
never
heard
anything
like
that
before
and
they
evidently
appreciated
it
she
read
through
to
the
end
then
were
unloosed
the
tongues
they
exclaimed
in
delight
what
an
accomplishment
it
is
said
roberts
and
how
few
possess
it
doctor
how
many
really
fine
readers
have
you
heard
in
your
life
about
three
said
the
doctor
laconically
well
said
roberts
let
us
all
be
exceptions
gracie
teach
us
how
i
will
try
and
she
did
on
the
first
verse
of
the
poem
with
better
success
than
before
but
how
sharp
the
contrast
between
her
reading
and
gracie
she
knew
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
read
i
do
know
possibly
i
am
mistaken
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
known
people
ready
for
large
sacrifices
who
yet
would
shrink
painfully
from
these
little
ones
in
discussing
the
programme
for
the
evening
the
question
had
been
when
each
had
done
his
part
how
were
they
to
influence
the
boys
to
join
they
join
was
it
probable
that
they
knew
enough
about
reading
to
attempt
to
speak
the
words
of
the
poem
with
reference
to
this
obstacle
a
poem
had
been
chosen
full
of
simple
homely
words
such
as
are
in
common
use
especially
was
the
first
verse
free
from
what
roberts
called
having
heard
the
verse
read
several
times
it
was
hoped
that
some
one
of
the
seven
might
have
courage
to
attempt
it
but
gracie
did
not
believe
that
such
would
be
the
case
i
do
see
how
we
can
ask
them
and
do
it
naturally
said
everett
it
is
such
an
thing
you
know
and
i
am
afraid
do
our
best
it
will
present
itself
to
them
as
a
patronage
and
that
will
be
fatal
the
people
who
are
low
enough
to
need
patronage
are
the
very
ones
who
wo
endure
whereupon
various
ways
of
managing
the
matter
were
discussed
and
discarded
suddenly
roberts
turned
to
her
young
lieutenant
who
had
been
silent
for
some
time
and
said
what
are
you
thinking
of
ried
do
you
see
a
way
out
no
he
said
i
have
neither
knowledge
nor
skill
in
such
matters
but
my
thoughts
just
then
were
far
away
i
was
thinking
how
curiously
certain
apparently
trivial
instances
of
one
childhood
will
stand
out
with
almost
startling
what
sent
you
off
in
that
direction
questioned
everett
there
must
have
been
an
association
of
oh
there
was
i
was
thinking
how
vividly
i
remembered
a
discussion
between
my
mother
and
my
sister
younger
than
ester
in
regard
to
some
matter
which
perplexed
them
and
when
they
could
come
to
no
satisfactory
conclusion
they
appealed
to
my
sister
ester
who
was
resting
as
usual
on
her
lounge
i
can
seem
to
hear
her
voice
as
she
said
have
to
do
anything
about
it
until
perhaps
will
have
a
light
of
its
own
for
our
thank
you
roberts
said
her
eyes
lighting
with
an
appreciative
smile
we
have
not
to
do
anything
about
this
until
monday
night
and
perhaps
monday
night
will
see
us
i
do
know
how
many
thought
of
this
little
conversation
when
monday
evening
came
but
certainly
alfred
ried
and
roberts
did
for
she
glanced
at
him
and
smiled
significantly
when
everett
having
apparently
forgotten
that
anything
beyond
their
own
pleasure
was
in
contemplation
challenged
gracie
to
a
discussion
as
to
the
emphasis
on
a
certain
word
in
the
second
line
he
had
never
heard
it
so
read
and
he
called
for
an
analysis
that
would
sustain
the
reading
and
received
it
and
was
not
yet
prepared
to
yield
the
point
but
read
the
verse
as
he
had
imagined
it
should
be
read
and
then
gracie
at
roberts
call
repeated
it
with
her
rendering
and
i
am
not
sure
but
all
parties
concerned
actually
forgot
their
final
object
in
the
interest
of
the
discussion
until
they
were
suddenly
called
to
it
by
an
interrupting
voice
the
way
it
said
with
an
emphatic
nod
of
a
shock
of
matted
hair
the
it
was
dirk
colson
he
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
anybody
was
listening
to
him
save
the
two
readers
he
was
looking
directly
at
gracie
and
the
nods
were
evidently
intended
for
her
of
course
it
is
she
said
eagerly
her
face
flushing
with
a
triumph
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
emphasis
you
read
it
wo
you
and
show
these
people
that
we
are
right
afterward
roberts
confessed
that
she
involuntarily
placed
her
hand
on
her
heart
with
a
dim
idea
of
hushing
its
beating
lest
others
would
hear
so
important
to
her
did
the
moment
seem
everett
looked
dismayed
the
least
hopeful
one
of
the
seven
seemed
dirk
none
of
them
knew
of
his
dangerous
talent
for
imitation
none
of
them
believed
that
he
would
make
any
attempt
at
reading
but
thought
he
would
shrink
into
deeper
sullenness
all
of
them
were
mistaken
he
reached
for
the
book
glanced
for
a
moment
over
the
lines
and
then
read
the
verse
with
so
complete
an
imitation
of
gracie
dennis
and
yet
with
a
voice
and
manner
that
so
fitted
the
homely
words
and
the
homely
scene
described
that
the
effect
was
actually
better
than
when
gracie
read
instinctively
the
cultured
portion
of
his
audience
greeted
the
effort
with
a
clapping
of
hands
the
blood
meantime
rolled
in
dark
waves
over
dirk
face
he
had
been
cheered
before
none
of
his
present
applauders
could
imagine
what
a
set
had
often
clapped
their
hands
over
his
successful
imitations
but
dirk
who
liked
applause
as
well
as
other
human
beings
do
had
never
in
his
wildest
stretches
of
imagination
placed
himself
before
such
people
as
listened
now
and
received
their
approval
great
was
the
excitement
and
satisfaction
the
six
companions
far
from
feeling
any
emotion
of
jealousy
seemed
greatly
elated
believing
that
one
of
their
number
had
made
a
hit
and
increased
their
importance
no
one
else
could
be
found
to
attempt
the
verse
nimble
dick
shook
his
head
and
declared
that
he
would
rather
undertake
to
run
an
engine
to
californy
than
try
it
and
the
others
were
of
like
mind
then
came
gracie
to
the
front
again
i
tell
you
what
you
must
all
do
i
have
been
experimenting
with
that
roberts
all
the
week
you
know
it
will
manifold
with
the
use
of
carbon
paper
and
it
chances
that
when
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
try
its
powers
in
that
direction
i
choose
this
very
verse
to
copy
so
i
have
fifteen
good
copies
in
print
you
must
each
take
a
copy
and
make
this
verse
a
study
until
next
monday
then
i
shall
challenge
you
all
to
sustain
me
in
my
this
proposition
was
hailed
with
such
satisfaction
by
the
older
members
that
it
immediately
became
popular
and
each
boy
received
his
copy
mechanically
and
gazed
at
it
curiously
but
dirk
colson
thoughts
were
turned
in
a
new
channel
look
here
he
said
detaining
gracie
by
an
imperious
inclination
of
his
head
as
she
handed
him
the
copy
how
did
you
make
these
you
print
them
fifteen
times
i
did
understand
what
you
why
no
said
gracie
the
machine
will
i
show
you
come
over
to
the
end
window
it
stands
there
waiting
to
be
displayed
and
it
is
a
little
then
they
crowded
around
the
and
gracie
really
proud
of
the
skill
she
had
acquired
in
a
week
time
showed
off
the
little
wonder
to
great
advantage
the
fact
that
the
was
new
to
most
of
the
others
that
they
were
decidedly
ignorant
as
to
its
working
increased
the
comfort
of
the
hour
by
doing
away
with
the
embarrassing
feeling
that
any
one
of
them
was
playing
a
part
everett
was
no
more
familiar
with
the
than
was
dirk
colson
and
was
just
as
eager
to
know
about
it
also
everybody
apparently
felt
an
equally
strong
desire
to
write
his
name
on
the
marvellous
little
creature
and
each
in
turn
sat
down
before
it
and
moved
his
awkward
hands
with
nearly
equal
slowness
over
the
keys
picking
out
the
magic
letters
it
was
this
episode
that
made
the
workers
during
their
next
conference
branch
out
in
new
lines
we
need
something
said
everett
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
in
puzzled
thought
we
need
something
that
shall
be
a
genuine
common
interest
of
which
we
are
all
or
all
but
one
equally
ignorant
something
that
we
can
take
hold
of
with
zest
on
as
low
a
platform
as
the
most
ignorant
of
those
seen
i
was
convinced
of
that
when
i
saw
the
abandon
with
which
we
all
went
into
the
business
with
a
naturalness
and
equality
that
in
the
matter
of
reading
and
writing
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
feel
if
the
machine
were
complicated
so
that
it
would
take
us
each
three
months
or
so
to
master
it
that
would
do
what
can
we
take
up
that
will
place
us
on
a
level
chapter
xix
we
have
begun
well
said
ried
we
should
want
to
have
one
of
our
number
not
a
level
how
would
it
do
to
appoint
you
sir
to
give
us
a
few
lectures
in
hygiene
popular
lectures
about
air
and
exercise
and
ventilation
and
bathing
and
all
sorts
of
topics
about
which
people
are
that
a
capital
idea
ried
those
fellows
could
certainly
be
benefited
by
a
little
attention
to
such
questions
and
i
sure
the
rest
of
us
would
like
to
hear
of
the
principles
which
govern
these
important
laws
such
lectures
put
into
popular
form
are
decidedly
interesting
i
think
let
us
vote
for
this
was
roberts
hearty
seconding
but
the
doctor
laughed
there
is
a
ludicrous
side
to
it
which
you
do
not
see
he
said
imagine
me
holding
forth
on
the
importance
of
ventilation
for
instance
to
a
poor
follow
who
comes
from
a
region
where
father
and
mother
and
a
horde
of
children
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
crowd
together
in
one
room
and
that
a
cellar
where
the
sun
never
penetrates
and
the
air
that
crawls
in
through
the
one
small
window
is
reeking
with
even
more
impurities
than
can
be
found
inside
or
talking
about
bathing
to
the
poor
wretches
who
have
no
clothing
to
change
and
barely
water
enough
by
carrying
it
long
distances
to
satisfy
their
most
pressing
needs
still
ried
i
not
quarrelling
with
your
idea
there
is
a
sensible
side
to
it
there
are
things
that
i
could
tell
even
those
boys
which
might
interest
them
and
would
certainly
be
to
their
advantage
to
know
the
subject
is
one
which
can
be
popularized
to
suit
even
such
an
audience
i
try
for
it
occasionally
if
it
shall
seem
best
but
it
does
meet
my
demand
i
want
us
all
on
a
platform
where
we
shall
start
in
equal
ignorance
and
get
on
together
of
course
you
are
all
more
or
less
familiar
with
all
the
facts
that
i
should
have
to
present
and
the
boys
would
know
it
they
are
sharp
fellows
it
would
take
them
an
hour
to
discover
that
we
were
fishing
for
them
and
if
there
is
any
one
thing
on
which
they
are
at
present
determined
it
is
probably
that
they
will
not
be
benefited
what
is
there
that
one
of
us
knows
of
which
the
others
are
ignorant
french
wo
do
for
miss
dennis
is
acquainted
with
that
language
i
think
and
so
are
you
ried
are
you
not
well
i
can
stammer
through
a
few
sentences
i
do
speak
it
like
a
native
as
you
at
this
revelation
a
vivid
blush
glowed
on
gracie
dennis
cheek
she
remembered
professor
ellis
comments
in
french
then
the
doctor
had
understood
though
his
face
was
so
imperturbable
what
could
he
have
thought
of
the
courtesy
of
her
guest
meantime
ried
wore
a
perplexed
face
you
are
right
he
said
to
the
doctor
we
are
not
enough
on
a
level
i
felt
our
advantage
last
night
when
miss
dennis
was
explaining
the
but
i
do
see
the
way
clear
what
subject
is
there
on
which
all
but
one
of
us
could
meet
on
common
ground
and
that
one
could
turn
professor
here
interposed
roberts
speaking
in
a
meek
tone
of
voice
if
i
were
not
a
modest
man
i
should
venture
a
suggestion
as
it
is
i
really
do
know
what
to
the
doctor
turned
to
him
quickly
out
with
it
man
if
you
are
master
of
a
profession
or
a
trade
or
a
theory
unknown
to
the
rest
of
us
you
are
bound
on
your
honor
as
a
member
of
this
unique
organization
to
present
at
the
same
moment
roberts
came
to
his
aid
oh
evan
teach
us
whereupon
roberts
heaved
what
was
intended
to
appear
as
a
relieved
sigh
and
announced
that
his
modesty
was
preserved
upon
this
suggestion
they
seized
with
eagerness
not
one
of
them
knew
anything
about
phonetic
writing
save
roberts
and
he
was
master
of
the
art
it
is
the
very
thing
the
doctor
said
with
heartiness
i
should
like
exceedingly
to
learn
it
and
ried
and
the
ladies
may
be
able
to
make
it
useful
in
a
hundred
ways
and
as
for
the
seven
if
they
really
master
it
it
may
be
the
foundation
of
a
fortune
for
some
of
so
without
more
ado
it
was
planned
that
at
the
very
next
monday
evening
the
subject
should
be
skilfully
presented
its
importance
and
its
fascinations
discussed
and
the
boys
be
beguiled
into
taking
a
first
lesson
sandwiched
in
between
the
reading
and
writing
lessons
alas
for
plans
on
the
very
next
monday
the
conspirators
with
the
exception
of
young
ried
were
together
by
seven
the
faint
aroma
of
coffee
floated
through
the
room
a
filled
with
oranges
occupied
a
conspicuous
table
and
everything
waited
for
the
guests
while
they
waited
instead
of
enjoying
themselves
as
the
four
were
certainly
capable
of
doing
they
were
noticeably
restless
listened
for
the
shuffling
of
careless
feet
on
the
steps
and
the
sound
of
uncultured
voices
in
the
hall
and
waited
expectantly
whenever
the
bell
pealed
only
to
be
obliged
to
send
word
to
some
caller
that
mr
and
roberts
were
the
special
occupation
of
the
four
seemed
to
be
to
look
at
their
watches
and
to
remark
that
the
doctor
was
a
trifle
fast
and
to
wonder
if
seven
would
be
a
more
suitable
hour
for
the
boys
and
to
wonder
what
could
be
detaining
ried
at
last
it
was
seven
and
then
it
was
fifteen
minutes
of
eight
and
then
it
was
ten
minutes
of
eight
and
then
the
rang
again
it
was
ried
and
he
was
alone
one
glance
at
his
distressed
face
told
the
that
something
was
amiss
even
before
he
exclaimed
you
wo
see
a
boy
why
what
is
the
trouble
where
are
they
these
were
the
various
ways
of
putting
the
same
question
one
of
the
mccullum
partners
has
become
interested
in
the
boys
it
seems
and
has
concluded
that
he
will
try
what
he
can
do
towards
their
elevation
so
he
has
commenced
by
presenting
each
one
of
them
with
a
ticket
to
the
green
street
theatre
and
there
they
are
at
this
moment
this
startling
intelligence
was
variously
received
everett
exclaimed
is
it
possible
gracie
dennis
remarked
that
it
was
something
like
what
she
had
expected
roberts
said
not
a
word
and
roberts
added
to
the
astonishment
of
the
moment
by
bursting
into
a
laugh
poor
ried
seemed
to
feel
the
laugh
more
than
anything
his
face
gathered
into
heavier
clouds
than
before
he
bit
his
lip
to
hold
back
the
vexed
words
that
were
just
ready
to
burst
forth
and
strode
almost
angrily
to
the
further
corner
of
the
room
an
embarrassed
silence
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
others
at
least
gracie
felt
embarrassed
the
doctor
looked
simply
expectant
at
last
roberts
drew
himself
up
from
his
lounging
attitude
and
broke
into
the
stillness
ah
now
good
people
do
let
us
make
serious
mistakes
come
back
here
my
dear
young
brother
and
let
us
look
this
thing
in
the
face
and
talk
it
over
calmly
are
we
children
playing
at
benevolence
that
at
the
first
discouragement
we
should
cry
out
is
lost
and
retire
vanquished
come
i
laughed
because
really
this
does
not
seem
such
a
serious
matter
to
me
as
it
seems
to
present
to
the
rest
of
you
what
did
we
expect
here
are
seven
boys
right
from
the
gutters
somehow
we
have
had
them
laid
on
our
hearts
and
have
enlisted
to
help
fight
the
battle
that
is
going
on
about
them
in
this
world
christ
died
to
save
them
and
satan
means
that
the
sacrifice
shall
be
in
vain
he
is
bringing
all
his
powers
to
bear
on
them
and
he
has
many
and
varied
powers
here
comes
into
the
scene
a
man
benevolently
inclined
not
a
christian
but
in
his
way
a
philanthropist
by
accident
he
has
come
in
contact
with
one
of
the
boys
by
accident
he
learns
that
something
he
does
not
know
quite
what
is
being
attempted
to
benefit
them
ca
you
give
him
the
credit
of
being
honest
the
only
thing
he
thinks
of
that
he
can
do
to
help
is
to
give
them
an
evening
entertainment
at
one
of
the
decent
theatres
there
is
being
presented
what
seems
to
be
known
in
their
parlance
as
a
play
so
he
presents
each
boy
with
a
ticket
now
what
did
we
expect
of
those
boys
last
week
a
lady
and
two
gentleman
who
have
been
members
of
our
church
for
years
left
the
regular
and
went
to
the
philharmonic
concert
ought
we
to
expect
that
it
would
even
occur
to
our
seven
boys
to
give
up
what
to
them
is
a
rare
treat
for
the
pleasure
of
spending
an
evening
with
us
as
for
the
moral
obligation
they
have
probably
never
so
much
as
heard
the
words
is
it
time
we
knew
what
we
were
about
what
are
we
after
it
is
well
enough
to
teach
the
poor
fellows
to
read
and
write
and
to
help
lift
them
up
in
other
ways
but
our
efforts
will
amount
to
very
little
unless
we
succeed
in
bringing
them
to
the
great
lever
of
human
society
unless
christ
take
hold
of
this
thing
we
shall
fail
now
has
he
taken
hold
is
he
at
least
as
much
interested
in
them
as
we
are
is
his
holy
spirit
preceding
and
supplementing
all
our
efforts
and
if
this
is
the
case
is
an
evening
at
a
theatre
going
to
ruin
his
plans
long
before
these
earnest
sentences
were
concluded
ried
had
returned
from
his
distant
corner
and
taken
a
seat
near
his
employer
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
his
voice
trembled
i
beg
your
pardon
roberts
i
an
ignorant
blunderer
i
did
feel
for
the
moment
as
though
everything
were
we
have
begun
backwards
said
roberts
i
was
reading
that
a
mistake
the
missionaries
made
for
years
in
trying
to
the
greenlanders
and
what
a
perfect
failure
they
made
of
it
until
one
day
almost
by
accident
a
man
began
to
tell
them
about
christ
on
the
cross
and
the
story
melted
them
i
do
think
i
have
thought
enough
about
him
in
this
i
stand
convicted
everett
said
i
made
the
same
mistake
i
believe
in
all
my
efforts
for
people
i
have
been
praying
for
them
it
is
true
but
after
all
i
feel
now
as
though
there
had
been
too
much
relying
on
human
means
and
not
enough
on
god
it
is
a
case
of
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
to
have
left
the
other
undone
well
said
roberts
looking
at
his
watch
we
are
in
the
same
condemnation
it
is
i
believe
the
most
common
and
one
of
the
most
fatal
mistakes
that
christian
workers
make
but
there
is
a
way
out
we
expected
to
spend
until
ten
with
those
boys
it
is
nearly
nine
now
suppose
we
spend
the
next
hour
with
christ
asking
for
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
on
any
and
every
effort
that
we
may
make
for
them
in
the
future
our
ultimate
aim
is
to
bring
every
one
of
them
to
jesus
and
he
knows
it
now
if
we
have
gone
about
in
the
wrong
way
we
have
only
to
ask
him
forgiveness
and
look
to
him
steadily
for
guidance
what
do
you
say
friends
shall
we
spend
the
hour
in
taking
them
to
the
only
one
who
really
can
afford
them
lasting
help
i
suppose
that
he
who
maketh
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
is
equally
able
to
manage
the
folly
of
man
could
the
injudicious
philanthropist
have
looked
into
that
room
that
evening
and
heard
the
prayers
that
went
up
to
god
for
those
boys
and
understood
something
of
the
power
of
prayer
he
would
have
had
one
illustration
of
how
god
manages
the
foolishness
of
men
it
was
a
very
earnest
these
workers
had
each
one
bowed
in
secret
and
with
more
or
less
earnestness
asked
for
god
blessing
on
their
efforts
but
it
occurred
to
them
that
evening
as
a
very
strange
thing
that
they
had
never
unitedly
prayed
for
this
before
therefore
there
was
an
element
of
confession
in
all
the
prayers
that
moved
gracie
dennis
strangely
especially
was
this
the
case
when
she
heard
her
old
acquaintance
flossy
pour
out
her
soul
longings
it
happened
so
strange
are
the
customs
of
christians
that
though
this
was
the
daughter
of
a
minister
of
the
gospel
herself
a
christian
she
had
never
before
heard
a
lady
pray
in
the
presence
of
gentlemen
she
had
heard
of
their
doing
so
heard
them
criticised
with
sharp
sarcasm
some
of
the
criticisms
which
had
sounded
full
of
keenness
and
wit
when
she
heard
them
recurred
to
her
at
this
time
and
some
way
with
low
earnest
voice
filling
her
heart
they
dwindled
into
shallowness
and
coarseness
all
the
same
their
baneful
influence
was
on
her
and
helped
to
hold
her
back
from
opening
her
lips
for
the
critic
had
been
professor
ellis
when
the
hostess
and
her
young
guest
were
left
alone
together
that
evening
the
latter
had
a
question
to
ask
flossy
shipley
the
name
you
will
remember
which
she
always
went
back
to
when
excited
i
did
know
you
believed
in
praying
in
have
you
changed
in
in
public
my
dear
with
a
quiet
smile
why
i
am
in
my
own
house
oh
yes
but
you
know
what
i
mean
before
gentlemen
do
you
really
think
it
is
necessary
as
to
that
gracie
i
do
believe
i
thought
anything
about
it
i
wanted
to
pray
for
those
boys
and
so
i
and
did
you
really
shrink
from
it
at
all
how
very
queer
flossy
i
do
believe
nobody
was
ever
so
much
changed
by
religion
as
you
have
been
i
do
see
what
makes
the
difference
i
sure
i
think
i
a
christian
but
i
could
never
do
such
a
thing
as
not
if
you
believed
it
to
be
your
duty
but
i
do
believe
it
said
the
fair
logician
her
face
flushing
i
think
it
is
out
of
place
i
beg
your
pardon
flossy
i
do
mean
i
think
it
sounded
badly
in
you
but
only
that
for
me
it
would
be
horrid
and
i
could
do
then
what
are
you
talking
about
my
dear
if
you
should
never
consider
it
your
duty
you
would
certainly
never
be
called
upon
to
do
chapter
xx
oh
what
a
nice
thought
this
very
calm
view
of
the
question
gave
gracie
time
to
recover
from
her
excitement
and
to
laugh
at
her
folly
then
roberts
said
still
speaking
very
gently
i
do
want
to
argue
with
you
dear
and
i
could
if
i
wished
you
know
i
am
a
dunce
about
all
such
things
but
i
just
want
to
ask
you
a
little
question
you
need
not
answer
me
unless
you
choose
not
now
that
is
perhaps
some
time
we
may
want
to
talk
about
it
i
would
like
to
know
the
reasons
that
people
have
for
thinking
that
it
is
out
of
place
for
a
lady
to
kneel
down
with
her
christian
friends
and
speak
to
jesus
about
a
thing
that
they
unitedly
desire
and
that
they
believe
he
is
able
to
do
for
them
if
it
is
not
proper
to
speak
before
them
why
is
it
proper
to
speak
them
on
the
same
subject
this
question
gracie
carried
to
her
room
for
thought
meantime
as
everett
and
young
ried
went
homeward
they
had
a
talk
together
when
i
found
out
that
those
boys
had
gone
to
the
theatre
i
was
completely
discouraged
declared
ried
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
work
was
a
failure
i
could
almost
see
satan
laughing
over
the
success
of
his
scheme
i
never
felt
so
about
anything
in
my
life
and
now
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
the
lord
will
let
it
result
in
being
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
to
all
of
which
everett
made
the
apparently
irrelevant
answer
mr
roberts
and
his
wife
are
singularly
well
mated
how
perfectly
they
fit
into
each
other
thoughts
ried
you
and
i
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
from
i
have
said
ried
meekly
yet
another
bit
of
talk
closed
this
evening
mccullum
has
given
me
an
idea
roberts
said
to
his
wife
as
they
sat
together
reviewing
the
day
not
a
bad
one
i
fancy
i
wonder
when
we
can
act
on
it
and
watch
results
there
are
tickets
for
other
places
besides
theatres
why
could
we
furnish
them
for
some
entertainment
lecture
or
concert
or
something
of
the
sort
that
would
be
really
helpful
the
only
difficulty
is
that
there
are
few
helpful
places
as
yet
within
reach
of
their
capacities
it
takes
an
exceptional
genius
to
hold
such
but
his
wife
her
face
aglow
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
what
a
beautiful
thought
she
said
and
how
nice
that
it
should
come
to
you
just
now
when
there
will
be
such
a
splendid
opportunity
to
put
it
in
practice
why
do
you
know
gough
next
week
fifty
cent
tickets
on
temperance
too
how
grand
and
evan
let
us
give
them
each
two
tickets
i
want
that
dirk
colson
to
take
his
sister
perhaps
he
will
not
but
then
he
may
one
can
never
tell
oh
evan
wo
it
be
nice
ah
said
roberts
as
usual
you
are
ahead
of
me
i
had
not
thought
of
the
two
tickets
apiece
that
is
a
suggestion
for
their
manliness
flossy
we
try
yet
another
bit
of
talk
they
shambled
down
the
stairs
from
the
hall
at
a
late
hour
that
evening
those
seven
boys
quiet
for
them
though
the
play
had
been
exciting
and
not
remarkably
moral
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
a
christian
after
all
said
nimble
dick
breaking
a
silence
with
speech
as
though
the
subject
of
which
he
spoke
had
been
under
discussion
among
them
after
all
it
was
rather
sneaking
to
bolt
and
say
nothing
i
kind
of
wish
we
had
done
that
what
i
told
you
all
along
said
dirk
colson
with
even
unusual
sullenness
but
you
would
go
and
do
it
and
we
was
fools
enough
to
follow
and
i
bet
she
had
oysters
or
something
this
from
jerry
tompkins
you
have
probably
no
idea
how
hungry
he
was
at
that
moment
they
was
goin
to
do
somethin
new
that
there
dennis
girl
told
me
so
when
i
met
her
on
the
street
yesterday
something
that
we
would
like
first
rate
she
said
a
this
was
stephen
crowley
contribution
to
the
general
discomfort
well
said
nimble
dick
and
the
sigh
with
which
he
spoke
the
word
would
have
gone
to
roberts
heart
i
it
all
up
now
i
should
wonder
if
we
never
got
another
bid
i
would
if
i
was
them
i
know
that
and
their
old
theatre
was
no
great
shakes
after
all
we
been
a
pack
of
fools
and
i
do
mind
owning
whereupon
having
reached
the
corner
they
separated
and
went
glumly
to
their
homes
and
this
is
gratitude
what
a
pity
mccullum
who
had
been
smiling
over
his
benevolence
all
the
evening
could
not
have
heard
them
the
weeks
that
followed
this
night
were
crowded
with
trifles
on
which
hung
important
and
results
this
is
a
very
trite
saying
i
know
all
weeks
are
crowded
with
eventful
trifles
at
least
we
in
our
blindness
call
them
trifles
although
we
are
constantly
discovering
their
importance
and
being
constantly
astonished
over
them
among
other
things
the
seven
boys
became
nine
having
taken
to
their
companionship
two
choice
spirits
apparently
worse
than
themselves
and
appeared
at
the
south
end
mission
with
all
the
bravado
that
boys
of
their
stamp
are
apt
to
put
on
when
they
feel
somewhat
ashamed
of
themselves
the
consequence
was
that
the
trials
which
roberts
had
to
endure
from
them
though
a
trifle
less
apparent
to
others
were
not
a
whit
less
distressing
than
usual
but
before
the
session
was
concluded
they
were
treated
to
a
sensation
that
held
them
in
silent
astonishment
for
nearly
five
minutes
any
person
well
acquainted
with
alfred
ried
could
have
told
that
he
had
a
plan
in
view
and
was
trying
to
carry
it
in
the
face
of
some
opposition
he
looked
convinced
and
durant
looked
astonished
and
troubled
there
was
much
talk
between
them
and
some
shaking
of
head
apparently
however
ried
came
off
victor
for
his
brow
cleared
and
he
presently
made
his
way
to
roberts
side
and
said
a
few
words
and
must
have
been
gratified
by
the
sudden
lighting
up
of
her
face
and
her
eager
oh
what
a
nice
thought
even
if
it
fails
apparently
it
will
not
utterly
for
the
suggestion
will
help
in
the
course
of
time
the
new
idea
came
to
the
front
there
was
to
be
a
festival
or
a
social
or
an
entertainment
at
the
south
end
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
a
sort
of
anniversary
of
the
starting
of
the
mission
among
other
work
that
was
in
progress
the
decoration
of
the
room
involving
the
hanging
of
pictures
banners
mottoes
wreaths
required
some
strong
arms
and
willing
hands
committees
were
to
be
formed
two
weeks
before
teachers
had
been
appointed
to
prepare
a
list
of
committees
it
fell
to
young
ried
to
appoint
the
committee
on
decoration
when
he
was
called
upon
for
his
report
he
came
promptly
forward
like
a
man
ready
for
action
and
commenced
a
committee
of
four
has
been
deemed
amply
sufficient
for
decoration
and
i
appoint
for
the
purpose
the
following
richard
bolton
morris
burns
miss
gracie
dennis
and
miss
annie
the
teachers
who
had
been
long
at
the
mission
looked
from
one
to
another
with
a
bewildered
air
morris
burns
they
knew
a
young
scotchman
with
willing
hands
and
feet
ever
ready
to
run
of
errands
for
all
workers
a
boy
of
nineteen
or
so
whom
everybody
liked
unselfish
and
thoroughly
trustworthy
annie
powell
was
one
of
the
older
girls
in
durant
a
ladylike
little
factory
girl
who
would
work
in
with
morris
burns
nicely
miss
gracie
dennis
was
roberts
beautiful
young
friend
all
the
teachers
knew
her
and
all
thought
it
very
kind
in
her
to
throw
her
strength
and
taste
into
the
preparations
as
heartily
as
though
she
were
one
of
them
but
who
was
richard
bolton
nobody
knew
yet
their
knowledge
of
business
etiquette
told
them
that
he
was
chairman
of
the
decoration
committee
where
was
he
not
a
teacher
certainly
for
they
were
intimately
acquainted
with
one
another
and
they
knew
no
such
name
in
the
one
made
up
of
trustworthy
helpers
over
in
roberts
class
with
the
single
exception
of
the
teacher
there
was
equal
ignorance
the
nine
boys
had
stopped
their
restless
mischief
to
listen
because
there
is
a
sort
of
fascination
to
boys
in
all
the
details
of
business
they
liked
to
hear
the
appointments
but
who
richard
bolton
might
be
seemed
not
to
occur
to
one
of
them
it
is
true
that
jerry
tompkins
nudged
nimble
dick
in
anything
but
a
quiet
way
with
his
elbow
and
murmured
you
got
a
namesake
it
seem
in
this
yet
no
light
dawned
on
them
durant
who
it
is
possible
has
not
appeared
to
you
in
a
favorable
light
for
the
reason
that
he
was
being
much
perplexed
by
the
entirely
new
methods
being
introduced
among
the
boys
who
had
heretofore
driven
him
to
the
very
verge
of
desperation
was
really
a
quickwitted
man
and
having
succumbed
to
what
he
feared
was
a
wild
experiment
knew
how
to
help
carry
it
out
properly
he
came
briskly
to
the
front
committee
being
the
last
on
the
list
and
began
his
work
the
chairmen
of
these
different
committees
will
be
kind
enough
to
report
to
me
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
time
and
place
of
their
first
meeting
for
consultation
and
i
will
make
the
then
he
stepped
to
roberts
class
bolton
he
said
bending
toward
that
astonished
scamp
and
speaking
as
though
this
were
an
affair
you
are
chairman
i
believe
of
the
decoration
committee
where
and
when
will
you
have
them
meet
imagine
nimble
dick
eyes
nay
imagine
the
eyes
and
faces
of
the
entire
nine
it
would
have
been
a
study
for
an
artist
for
a
moment
nimble
dick
was
speechless

ca
you
bolton
i
tell
you
i
do
know
nothin
what
you
are
talking
nimble
dick
who
was
rarely
anything
but
was
surprised
by
the
bewilderments
of
the
situation
into
being
almost
as
fierce
as
dirk
colson
was
habitually
the
gaping
amazement
of
his
boon
companions
seeming
to
add
to
his
irritation
but
you
will
said
his
teacher
cheerily
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
explain
miss
dennis
knows
all
about
such
things
and
i
going
to
help
though
they
have
honored
me
with
an
at
a
sign
from
the
lady
durant
stepped
back
to
his
platform
and
announced
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
decoration
desires
me
to
say
that
his
committee
is
called
together
evening
at
the
young
social
parlors
no
east
street
at
six
as
the
chairman
has
another
engagement
at
i
had
to
coin
a
name
for
the
place
of
meeting
he
said
to
roberts
afterwards
i
beg
your
pardon
if
it
was
wrong
but
ried
has
been
giving
me
glowing
accounts
of
that
room
and
you
said
something
about
its
being
a
social
parlor
did
you
it
is
a
good
name
said
roberts
we
have
awkwardly
called
it
the
room
i
am
glad
it
is
christened
i
will
have
some
curtains
hung
through
the
centre
to
make
parlors
instead
of
parlor
of
it
i
can
see
how
a
second
room
can
be
made
useful
in
several
thus
was
the
bewildering
committee
willed
into
existence
the
chairman
thereof
being
still
so
dumbfounded
with
his
position
that
he
did
not
rouse
until
the
laughing
boys
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
began
to
take
in
some
of
the
fun
of
the
situation
and
to
assault
him
right
and
left
with
mock
congratulations
groans
hisses
and
the
like
then
he
turned
towards
them
with
dignity
that
would
have
fitted
dirk
colson
and
said
if
you
fellows
do
shut
up
and
behave
yourselves
something
like
decent
for
the
rest
of
the
time
i
chaw
half
a
dozen
of
you
into
mincemeat
as
soon
as
we
are
out
of
this
chapter
xxi
had
his
experiment
been
too
severe
everett
was
driving
rapidly
through
the
city
at
least
as
rapidly
as
the
crowded
character
of
the
street
would
permit
he
was
out
on
professional
duty
and
had
just
been
congratulating
himself
that
his
regular
calls
were
now
made
for
the
day
and
unless
something
special
intervened
he
should
have
a
couple
of
hours
free
for
the
alleys
that
meant
professional
duty
too
and
of
the
very
hardest
character
one
would
suppose
as
it
brought
him
in
contact
not
only
with
sickness
in
some
of
its
most
repulsive
forms
but
with
abject
poverty
as
well
and
too
often
with
loathsome
forms
of
sin
yet
he
went
about
this
work
with
a
zest
that
his
regular
practice
did
not
furnish
this
was
something
done
solely
for
jesus
sake
and
with
an
eye
that
was
manifestly
single
to
his
glory
he
had
already
selected
his
alley
and
was
planning
how
when
his
horses
were
safely
stabled
he
could
make
a
to
it
when
his
eyes
were
held
by
two
persons
who
were
ascending
together
the
stairway
that
led
to
one
of
the
public
halls
his
face
darkened
as
he
watched
them
apparently
they
were
engrossed
with
each
other
and
took
no
notice
of
him
but
there
were
reasons
why
he
specially
desired
to
keep
them
in
view
a
network
of
carriages
and
wagons
such
as
is
common
to
crowded
thoroughfares
blocked
his
path
just
then
and
prolonged
his
opportunity
to
watch
the
two
they
made
their
way
in
a
very
leisurely
manner
up
the
long
staircase
letting
others
more
in
haste
pass
them
continually
yet
presently
they
joined
the
group
who
were
passing
up
tickets
of
entrance
the
doctor
signalled
a
policeman
and
entered
into
conversation
what
is
going
on
in
seltzer
hall
well
sir
there
a
kind
of
a
concert
i
guess
they
play
on
goblets
they
say
just
common
glass
goblets
and
make
fine
an
afternoon
entertainment
yes
sir
as
a
kind
of
introduction
you
know
they
expect
to
get
a
crowd
for
evening
by
the
do
you
know
where
tickets
are
to
be
had
the
policeman
indicated
a
bookstore
at
his
left
by
a
gesture
from
his
thumb
and
said
right
here
and
offered
to
secure
some
at
once
he
knew
everett
many
of
the
policemen
did
his
offer
was
accepted
with
thanks
and
the
doctor
presently
wound
his
way
out
from
the
network
with
two
green
tickets
in
his
pocket
his
plans
for
the
afternoon
had
been
suddenly
changed
instead
of
spending
the
time
in
sewell
alley
he
had
decided
to
attend
a
musical
exhibition
the
instruments
being
goblets
he
must
make
all
speed
now
so
he
left
the
crowded
street
and
dodged
through
several
byways
to
the
stables
no
use
to
keep
his
horses
she
would
be
afraid
to
drive
through
such
crowds
he
explained
to
himself
and
i
should
be
afraid
to
leave
the
carriage
rushing
out
from
the
stables
he
caught
just
the
right
and
in
a
short
space
of
time
was
ringing
at
roberts
door
gracie
dennis
was
in
the
hall
dressed
for
the
street
ah
said
the
doctor
i
am
either
fortunate
or
unfortunate
i
wonder
which
i
had
set
my
heart
on
having
you
for
a
companion
to
what
i
fancy
may
be
a
unique
entertainment
is
there
another
engagement
in
the
way
i
know
this
is
a
most
unconventional
method
but
a
doctor
is
never
sure
of
his
but
gracie
dennis
felt
too
well
acquainted
with
everett
and
was
too
young
and
ready
for
enjoyment
to
be
disturbed
about
conventionality
she
merrily
declared
her
willingness
to
be
taken
to
whatever
entertainment
the
doctor
had
to
propose
roberts
was
out
with
her
husband
on
business
connected
with
church
matters
and
she
had
only
intended
to
walk
a
square
or
two
for
her
health
on
the
way
the
doctor
was
distrait
gracie
having
most
of
the
talking
to
do
herself
the
truth
was
he
was
trying
to
recall
the
faces
of
the
people
he
had
seen
crowding
into
the
hall
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
taking
gracie
among
people
whom
he
would
not
care
to
have
her
meet
apparently
the
couple
whose
movements
had
changed
all
his
afternoon
plans
were
not
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
respectability
however
his
face
cleared
as
he
recalled
one
and
another
as
being
in
the
crowd
seeking
admission
they
might
not
be
of
the
class
with
whom
gracie
was
accustomed
to
mingle
but
they
were
respectable
people
gracie
was
in
a
merry
mood
she
understood
enough
of
the
doctor
busy
life
to
feel
sure
that
this
sudden
resolve
to
be
entertained
was
quite
out
of
his
ordinary
line
and
that
of
itself
served
to
mark
the
hour
as
exceptional
he
feels
the
need
of
a
little
fun
she
told
herself
and
i
help
him
to
have
it
if
i
can
poor
man
it
must
be
doleful
to
go
among
sick
and
dying
people
all
the
they
were
late
at
the
hall
the
concert
was
well
under
way
but
there
were
plenty
of
vacant
seats
everett
swept
his
eye
over
the
room
then
indicated
to
the
usher
just
which
seat
he
would
have
it
was
one
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
young
man
and
woman
who
seemed
to
have
such
a
mysterious
influence
over
his
plans
he
was
relieved
to
find
quite
early
in
the
entertainment
that
it
really
was
unique
and
in
its
way
well
worth
hearing
had
the
surroundings
been
agreeable
he
could
easily
have
given
himself
up
to
enjoyment
however
they
had
been
seated
but
a
few
moments
when
he
saw
by
startled
eyes
that
she
had
seen
and
recognized
at
least
one
of
the
couple
at
their
left
professor
ellis
in
his
usual
faultless
attire
lounged
gracefully
on
the
seat
in
such
a
manner
that
his
was
distinct
he
rested
a
arm
on
the
back
of
the
seat
next
him
and
his
delicately
gloved
hand
almost
if
not
quite
touched
the
shoulder
of
his
companion
both
he
and
the
lady
at
his
side
gave
extremely
little
attention
to
the
entertainment
in
progress
apparently
they
had
come
thither
for
purposes
of
conversation
they
kept
up
a
continuous
murmur
of
talk
interspersed
at
intervals
with
rippling
laughter
and
really
seemed
so
entirely
absorbed
in
each
other
as
to
have
at
times
forgotten
that
the
hall
was
public
and
that
the
attention
of
many
was
being
turned
toward
them
the
girl
was
pretty
extremely
so
with
an
entirely
different
style
of
beauty
from
gracie
dennis
and
a
certain
indescribable
something
in
her
face
and
manner
would
have
told
even
the
most
casual
observer
that
she
moved
in
a
different
circle
it
was
not
her
dress
unless
that
was
a
little
too
pronounced
for
the
place
and
hour
but
quite
young
ladies
in
good
society
sometimes
make
a
similar
mistake
neither
was
her
manner
objectionable
to
the
degree
that
you
could
have
pointed
to
any
one
thing
as
offensive
yet
you
would
have
been
sure
had
you
watched
her
that
she
was
without
the
pale
of
what
we
call
society
gracie
dennis
watched
her
with
a
kind
of
fascination
becoming
at
last
so
absorbed
with
the
watching
and
the
apparently
troubled
thoughts
which
grew
out
of
it
that
she
gave
but
slight
attention
to
everett
occasional
remarks
nor
seemed
to
observe
that
at
last
he
lapsed
into
total
silence
once
during
the
hour
the
young
woman
glanced
casually
in
their
direction
and
the
careless
nod
and
free
and
easy
smile
with
she
acknowledged
everett
presence
drew
a
startled
glance
from
gracie
to
rest
on
him
for
a
moment
now
i
wish
i
had
my
horses
the
doctor
said
as
at
last
they
made
their
way
down
the
aisle
i
have
a
mile
drive
up
town
to
take
and
i
think
the
exercise
might
be
good
for
gracie
caught
at
the
suggestion
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
bookstore
below
while
he
went
for
the
horses
i
want
a
ride
and
i
want
to
talk
with
you
she
said
simply
as
this
was
precisely
what
he
wanted
he
went
for
the
horses
without
more
delay
meantime
gracie
in
one
of
the
windows
of
the
bookstore
was
supposed
to
be
employed
in
examining
a
late
book
but
in
reality
gave
much
attention
to
the
couple
who
were
crossing
the
street
or
rather
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
do
so
they
seemed
in
no
haste
but
were
conspicuous
even
in
the
crowded
street
for
their
interest
in
each
other
more
than
one
policeman
regarded
them
narrowly
as
professor
ellis
stood
with
head
bent
toward
the
lady
engaged
in
eager
and
animated
conversation
it
was
just
the
attitude
of
absorbed
interest
with
which
he
had
so
often
listened
to
gracie
not
on
the
street
it
is
true
but
in
some
crowded
parlor
and
it
had
flattered
her
it
made
her
frown
they
were
starting
now
to
make
the
disagreeable
crossing
he
had
taken
his
companion
hand
preparatory
to
a
leap
over
a
muddy
curbing
but
gracie
could
see
that
there
was
a
pressure
of
it
that
was
unnecessary
and
for
the
street
peculiar
his
face
too
was
distinctly
visible
and
the
expression
on
it
was
what
gracie
had
seen
before
but
certainly
she
supposed
no
other
person
had
altogether
it
was
probably
well
for
professor
ellis
peace
of
mind
that
he
did
not
turn
at
that
moment
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
young
lady
in
the
bookstore
instead
he
took
his
lady
away
and
they
were
lost
in
the
crowd
everett
making
all
haste
with
his
horses
had
still
time
for
anxious
thought
had
his
experiment
been
too
severe
on
gracie
was
it
possible
that
her
interest
in
the
man
was
such
that
the
experience
had
been
mixed
with
pain
as
well
as
with
disgust
he
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
the
young
girl
cared
for
such
a
man
as
professor
ellis
yet
there
had
been
a
look
on
her
face
when
she
saw
those
two
which
startled
and
hurt
him
when
fairly
seated
in
his
carriage
he
did
not
speak
until
they
had
threaded
the
maze
of
wagons
and
reached
clear
ground
even
then
he
only
said
now
for
speed
and
gave
the
horses
their
desire
until
crowds
and
business
were
left
behind
and
they
were
driving
down
a
broad
avenue
lined
on
either
side
with
stately
yet
homes
then
he
drew
rein
and
obliged
the
horses
to
walk
he
had
by
this
time
resolved
on
probing
the
wound
if
there
was
one
i
wish
i
knew
just
how
much
of
a
villain
that
man
these
were
the
somewhat
startling
words
which
broke
his
silence
what
man
yet
the
very
tones
of
gracie
voice
indicated
that
she
knew
of
whom
he
was
speaking
that
man
ellis
professor
i
think
he
is
called
i
have
reason
to
be
very
suspicious
of
him
by
the
way
miss
gracie
i
think
he
is
an
acquaintance
of
yours
have
you
confidence
in
him
how
promptly
and
indignantly
such
a
question
would
have
received
an
affirmative
answer
two
months
before
what
should
she
say
now
in
what
respect
she
faltered
more
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
time
than
because
she
did
not
understand
the
question
well
in
any
respect
i
am
almost
prepared
to
say
i
have
not
the
honor
of
the
man
acquaintance
but
whatever
i
hear
about
him
or
see
in
him
i
dislike
and
distrust
just
at
present
his
ways
are
specially
disturbing
you
noticed
him
this
afternoon
i
think
the
young
girl
in
his
company
belongs
to
my
i
have
a
deep
interest
in
her
partly
because
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
who
is
always
more
or
less
in
danger
in
this
wicked
world
and
partly
because
she
is
capable
of
strongly
influencing
another
who
is
a
special
of
who
is
the
girl
gracie
manner
was
abrupt
and
her
voice
constrained
it
was
evident
that
she
was
making
great
effort
to
control
herself
and
appear
indifferent
to
all
parties
the
doctor
took
no
notice
of
her
constraint
her
name
is
mason
hester
mason
she
attends
the
packard
place
which
you
know
i
superintend
she
is
motherless
and
worse
than
fatherless
is
a
clerk
in
one
of
the
fourth
avenue
stores
and
is
or
was
inclined
to
be
what
is
called
gay
i
do
not
know
that
that
term
conveys
any
special
meaning
to
you
in
young
men
i
think
they
call
the
same
line
of
conduct
i
hope
and
believe
that
you
would
not
well
understand
either
term
yet
i
think
possibly
that
watching
her
this
afternoon
in
a
public
hall
will
give
you
some
conception
of
the
stretch
that
there
is
between
yourself
and

some
people
are
hard
to
had
everett
desired
in
a
few
words
to
show
gracie
the
gulf
between
herself
and
the
man
who
had
been
the
girl
companion
for
the
afternoon
perhaps
he
could
not
have
formed
his
sentence
better
she
shivered
visibly
and
the
doctor
drew
the
more
carefully
about
her
while
he
continued
i
would
not
want
to
give
you
a
wrong
estimate
of
hester
mason
nor
lead
you
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
believe
a
girl
who
serves
behind
a
counter
can
not
be
a
true
lady
i
wanted
rather
to
explain
to
you
that
her
opportunities
had
been
limited
she
means
to
be
a
good
girl
i
think
in
fact
i
may
say
i
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
her
intentions
she
is
not
a
christian
but
a
few
weeks
ago
i
had
her
name
on
my
as
one
who
was
almost
persuaded
she
has
been
fighting
the
question
of
personal
religion
for
some
time
her
special
being
that
she
is
and
has
quite
a
clear
idea
of
how
christians
ought
to
live
and
can
find
very
few
who
seem
to
her
to
be
living
what
they
profess
however
as
i
say
i
have
been
very
hopeful
of
her
until
within
a
few
weeks
when
she
came
in
contact
with
this
man
and
i
tremble
for
the
result
he
is
constant
in
his
attentions
and
she
is
evidently
flattered
and
how
long
has
he
known
her
how
did
he
become
acquainted
abrupt
questions
still
asked
in
that
curiously
repressed
voice
the
doctor
face
was
growing
very
grave
and
stern
he
feared
that
there
was
a
real
wound
here
inadvertently
miss
dennis
it
seems
that
both
you
and
i
are
to
blame
or
at
least
are
involved
in
the
acquaintance
do
you
remember
a
little
incident
which
occurred
in
a
streetcar
some
six
weeks
ago
a
young
woman
in
leaving
the
car
dropped
a
package
which
you
noticing
called
our
attention
to
and
pointed
out
the
person
crossing
the
street
and
professor
ellis
announced
his
willingness
to
overtake
her
and
return
the
package
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
car
miss
mason
was
the
person
in
question
and
professor
ellis
presumed
on
that
very
slight
introduction
to
cultivate
an
acquaintance
i
have
learned
that
he
quoted
my
name
in
connection
with
the
incident
and
since
that
day
has
been
on
terms
of
exceeding
intimacy
with
gracie
was
surprised
out
of
her
reserve
i
remember
the
incident
perfectly
but
the
girl
i
saw
this
afternoon
can
not
be
the
one
who
was
on
the
yes
she
was
in
holiday
attire
and
in
her
working
garb
when
you
saw
her
momentarily
on
the
car
i
remember
a
feeling
of
regret
that
professor
ellis
should
have
so
promptly
volunteered
to
do
your
errand
yet
i
did
not
know
what
i
dreaded
i
simply
shrank
from
the
man
and
wanted
others
to
do
dr
everett
what
is
his
motive
in
showing
her
attention
i
wish
i
knew
i
can
tell
you
what
i
greatly
fear
that
it
is
to
play
with
the
human
heart
to
see
to
what
extent
he
can
gain
power
over
it
and
in
this
case
certainly
it
is
a
most
cruel
thing
the
girl
has
no
friends
no
father
or
mother
to
advise
with
or
help
her
she
is
bright
and
pretty
and
is
being
shown
glimpses
of
a
world
that
seems
to
her
like
fairyland
she
is
dazzled
and
one
can
not
blame
her
for
she
has
neither
judgment
nor
trustworthy
friends
to
lean
upon
miss
dennis
you
can
judge
from
her
manner
this
afternoon
what
is
her
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
polite
society
i
do
not
think
she
has
an
idea
that
she
was
conspicuous
save
for
her
beauty
and
the
fine
appearance
of
her
attendant
she
is
not
one
to
shrink
from
what
she
would
consider
legitimate
public
admiration
and
this
you
can
see
but
adds
to
her
but
everett
you
do
not
think
you
can
not
mean
that
he
intends
to
pay
her
special
attention
that
he
means
anything
beyond
the
desire
to
give
her
a
little
pleasure
well
said
the
doctor
speaking
slowly
but
with
firmness
you
may
judge
miss
dennis
what
i
think
what
any
honorable
person
thinks
of
a
man
who
bestows
in
public
the
sort
of
attentions
which
we
saw
this
afternoon
you
would
have
been
insulted
by
them
the
only
reason
that
this
poor
girl
was
not
is
because
she
does
not
know
any
better
did
you
observe
the
flashing
of
a
peculiarly
set
ring
on
her
finger
i
have
reason
to
fear
that
it
belongs
to
him
and
that
she
believes
herself
specially
honored
in
being
asked
to
wear
poor
gracie
cheeks
were
flaming
now
she
had
not
observed
the
ring
but
she
knew
it
well
and
for
one
brief
evening
had
worn
it
herself
and
then
had
returned
it
to
the
owner
with
the
assurance
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
wear
it
without
her
father
consent
she
remembered
what
a
wound
she
had
felt
herself
bestowing
when
he
had
looked
at
her
with
those
expressive
reproachful
eyes
and
replied
that
if
she
felt
toward
him
as
he
did
to
her
she
would
not
allow
even
a
to
come
between
them
and
he
had
actually
given
that
ring
into
the
keeping
of
this
girl
they
rode
on
in
silence
the
doctor
giving
a
hint
to
the
horses
that
they
might
go
as
fast
as
they
chose
he
was
in
great
doubt
and
pain
of
heart
could
it
be
possible
that
this
young
girl
was
caught
in
the
toils
of
a
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
an
unprincipled
villain
if
so
had
he
been
unnecessarily
cruel
in
his
revelations
ought
he
to
take
her
home
or
drive
further
and
give
her
time
to
recover
herself
could
he
have
understood
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
he
would
have
known
better
what
next
to
say
the
simple
truth
was
this
before
she
came
to
roberts
the
child
had
believed
herself
to
be
a
martyr
to
the
unreasonable
prejudices
of
her
stepmother
she
had
been
led
to
feel
that
her
father
had
turned
against
her
solely
because
of
his
influence
over
him
and
that
the
wife
was
piqued
because
professor
ellis
had
not
paid
her
sufficient
attention
in
the
days
of
her
maidenhood
this
the
professor
had
succeeded
in
teaching
gracie
to
feel
was
the
sole
charge
against
him
he
was
therefore
an
man
and
therefore
her
heart
went
out
towards
him
in
sympathy
it
had
not
been
at
first
a
stronger
feeling
than
this
but
flattered
by
his
attentions
so
much
more
marked
and
polished
than
had
ever
been
offered
to
the
young
girl
before
she
had
taught
herself
to
believe
that
but
for
her
father
bitterness
she
could
be
to
professor
ellis
what
he
delicately
and
vaguely
assured
her
no
one
else
could
and
fill
a
place
that
hitherto
in
his
lonely
life
had
been
left
void
she
had
not
engaged
herself
to
him
indeed
he
had
never
in
actual
words
asked
her
to
do
so
but
to
the
young
and
innocent
and
there
is
a
language
which
speaks
as
clearly
as
words
and
is
held
as
sacred
gracie
had
allowed
herself
to
be
looked
upon
as
one
who
was
held
by
from
being
more
to
professor
ellis
than
she
was
who
might
always
perhaps
be
held
back
for
she
had
resolved
in
her
own
sad
heart
that
she
would
never
marry
against
her
father
consent
no
not
if
she
were
twice
of
age
of
late
strange
reflections
had
come
to
her
she
had
measured
professor
ellis
with
other
men
christian
men
and
he
had
appeared
at
a
disadvantage
also
she
had
measured
herself
by
the
side
of
other
christian
workers
and
herself
had
appeared
at
a
disadvantage
a
vague
unrest
and
dissatisfaction
with
her
christian
experience
were
growing
on
her
moreover
she
was
growing
interested
in
those
boys
as
she
had
not
believed
that
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
be
interested
when
she
first
saw
them
she
began
to
believe
that
some
of
them
at
least
would
be
saved
she
wanted
to
help
save
them
and
to
help
others
her
martyrdom
dwindled
rapidly
into
insignificance
until
there
would
pass
entire
days
in
which
she
did
not
once
remember
that
she
as
an
unhappy
girl
at
last
but
a
week
or
two
before
this
afternoon
she
had
taken
her
affairs
in
hand
and
tried
to
look
steadily
at
them
the
result
of
her
hours
of
thought
and
prayer
was
that
she
was
bound
to
professor
ellis
that
is
provided
there
should
come
a
time
in
the
dim
and
distant
future
when
her
father
should
give
his
consent
it
would
be
her
duty
and
her
pleasure
because
of
what
had
passed
between
them
to
marry
him
still
she
began
to
feel
less
amazed
at
her
father
opinion
of
him
less
angry
about
it
she
began
to
say
to
herself
softly
and
pitifully
poor
lonely
man
he
has
no
one
to
be
his
friend
he
is
not
a
christian
and
that
is
what
makes
so
great
a
difference
between
him
and
others
it
is
that
which
papa
misses
but
i
must
not
desert
him
i
must
pray
for
him
all
the
time
and
work
for
his
conversion
then
he
will
grow
to
be
the
sort
of
man
whom
papa
can
like
and
everything
will
be
and
while
she
said
it
she
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
over
the
thought
that
she
was
very
young
and
that
it
would
be
a
long
time
yet
before
anything
could
be
settled
and
that
meantime
it
certainly
was
not
right
for
her
to
have
anything
to
do
with
professor
ellis
only
to
pray
for
him
and
that
perhaps
her
father
would
allow
her
to
carry
out
a
project
that
was
under
delightful
discussion
in
the
roberts
family
namely
to
remain
in
the
city
as
a
pupil
in
the
famous
green
lawn
school
and
she
did
not
know
foolish
little
thing
that
so
far
even
as
her
heart
was
concerned
everything
was
wrong
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
explain
to
you
that
is
if
you
do
not
understand
without
explanation
what
a
turmoil
she
was
thrown
into
by
this
afternoon
experience
she
was
far
from
realizing
as
yet
that
the
uppermost
feeling
even
now
was
not
wounded
love
but
wounded
pride
of
what
poor
stuff
she
had
been
making
a
hero
nothing
had
ever
opened
her
eyes
like
this
before
was
it
possible
that
she
had
spent
entire
evenings
with
a
man
who
stooped
to
set
in
unpleasant
even
suspicious
light
not
his
own
character
only
but
that
of
an
ignorant
young
girl
it
would
not
do
to
plead
a
lack
of
knowledge
in
excuse
for
him
he
might
be
ignorant
of
the
ways
of
the
christian
world
but
no
one
understood
better
the
rules
which
governed
society
during
part
of
the
afternoon
she
had
been
very
angry
with
the
girl
but
after
listening
to
everett
it
began
to
dawn
upon
her
that
her
friend
had
been
playing
with
the
ignorance
of
a
girl
who
probably
trusted
him
fully
you
are
to
understand
that
gracie
dennis
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
be
made
very
angry
by
such
a
suspicion
the
glow
on
her
cheeks
was
not
all
caused
by
the
fresh
air
of
the
spring
day
dr
everett
she
said
at
last
breaking
the
silence
what
do
you
think
he
means
by
asking
the
girl
to
wear
that
ring
or
by
letting
her
wear
it
does
he
do
you
suppose
that
he
has
engaged
himself
to
her
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
meant
everett
said
again
a
surge
of
indignation
rushing
over
him
if
he
really
meant
anything
so
honorable
as
that
it
would
be
bad
enough
business
for
poor
hester
but
as
i
said
i
distrust
the
man
utterly
and
from
my
experience
with
the
world
i
have
reason
from
your
knowledge
of
him
miss
dennis
could
you
suppose
him
to
be
honest
and
earnest
in
his
attentions
to
that
girl
it
was
a
very
plain
question
it
meant
more
to
everett
than
even
gracie
saw
but
she
saw
enough
to
know
that
she
was
admitting
an
intimacy
that
made
her
blush
however
she
answered
steadily
no
i
can
not
think
that
he
is
honest
or
so
i
fear
witness
this
afternoon
gentlemen
do
not
parade
their
friendships
before
the
public
gaze
and
that
man
knows
the
doctor
voice
was
stern
he
was
sure
now
that
there
was
a
wound
and
that
it
was
being
probed
he
believed
in
making
thorough
work
even
with
wounds
there
would
be
more
hope
of
genuine
healing
afterward
gracie
next
question
if
her
companion
had
but
known
it
was
a
singular
one
why
have
not
people
who
are
her
friends
warned
her
against
him
and
held
her
back
from
making
such
a
false
step
if
she
does
it
in
ignorance
oh
gracie
dennis
how
are
warnings
sometimes
received
even
by
girls
who
have
every
reason
to
trust
the
love
that
would
shield
them
some
people
are
very
hard
to
warn
said
the
doctor
i
have
tried
it
and
i
have
a
friend
who
has
tried
to
help
her
but
the
poor
girl
you
must
remember
has
not
been
brought
up
in
a
christian
atmosphere
has
never
had
a
christian
friend
who
came
with
the
authority
of
relationship
if
she
had
a
good
father
the
way
would
be
made
so
plain
as
it
is
ca
you
see
how
naturally
she
distrusts
the
rest
of
us
in
favor
of
the
man
who
makes
special
professions
of
friendship
i
am
not
surprised
at
hester
i
am
only
sorry
for
had
the
doctor
been
carefully
informed
as
to
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
gracie
intimacy
with
the
professor
he
could
not
have
chosen
words
which
would
have
touched
her
conscience
more
had
not
her
good
father
tenderly
and
patiently
warned
her
and
had
she
not
chosen
to
blind
her
eyes
to
all
his
words
and
believe
rather
in
professor
ellis
than
in
him
chapter
xxiii
part
of
the
great
i
must
call
at
this
house
the
doctor
said
suddenly
drawing
rein
before
a
quiet
little
house
at
the
foot
of
a
wide
lawn
the
gatekeeper
of
this
american
castle
has
a
sick
child
whom
i
have
promised
to
see
can
you
hold
the
horses
miss
dennis
or
shall
i
tie
them
this
is
a
quiet
spot
and
they
are
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
gracie
said
eyes
aglow
as
well
as
cheeks
and
the
doctor
went
into
the
house
wondering
whether
professor
ellis
if
he
could
see
her
now
would
not
be
afraid
of
her
once
inside
he
gave
a
start
of
surprise
almost
of
dismay
for
the
face
which
appeared
at
the
open
door
of
the
belonged
to
joy
saunders
you
here
he
said
trying
to
control
the
disturbed
element
in
his
voice
she
answered
quietly
i
came
out
by
did
you
drive
yes
he
said
abruptly
but
i
am
not
alone
how
is
the
child
and
he
went
forward
at
once
to
his
professional
duties
leaving
her
to
wonder
over
his
manner
it
was
peculiar
certainly
joy
saunders
was
used
to
abruptness
from
this
man
but
there
was
a
quality
in
it
that
she
did
not
recognize
she
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
gracie
dennis
holding
the
horses
saw
her
red
red
cheeks
and
flashing
eyes
and
the
peculiar
haughty
poise
of
her
head
with
which
the
stepmother
at
home
was
well
acquainted
she
did
not
know
this
gracie
dennis
save
by
reputation
once
everett
had
asked
her
to
call
at
roberts
and
had
made
her
feel
as
though
she
were
foolishly
conventional
in
declining
to
do
so
how
is
she
ever
to
know
you
according
to
the
rules
which
trammel
society
there
ought
to
be
some
way
arranged
for
christians
to
be
free
from
this
had
been
his
comment
but
he
had
not
asked
her
again
and
she
had
never
met
roberts
nor
yet
gracie
dennis
yet
she
knew
her
very
well
and
had
watched
her
often
as
she
passed
she
knew
instantly
who
she
was
now
as
she
sat
there
in
her
haughty
beauty
checking
with
determined
hand
the
impatience
of
those
horses
oh
she
knew
more
than
this
it
was
very
apparent
now
why
everett
was
peculiarly
abrupt
and
well
yes
embarrassed
she
had
almost
thought
that
was
the
name
of
the
feeling
only
it
had
seemed
so
absurd
and
then
joy
saunders
held
her
meek
little
head
high
and
told
herself
that
he
need
not
fear
her
presence
she
could
go
as
she
had
come
in
the
the
doctor
came
towards
her
now
speaking
rapidly
as
usual
joy
the
child
is
very
sick
there
ought
to
be
an
experienced
person
here
not
you
i
am
sorry
you
came
up
do
you
think
your
mother
would
come
will
you
ride
down
with
me
i
have
miss
dennis
in
the
carriage
but
it
is
quite
large
enough
for
three
you
then
joy
had
turned
away
her
head
holding
it
high
and
said
no
thank
you
i
am
going
down
in
the
and
that
blundering
doctor
drew
on
his
gloves
saying
to
himself
i
do
know
but
that
is
best
and
went
out
only
waiting
to
say
to
joy
will
you
ask
your
mother
about
it
i
will
see
her
as
soon
as
i
can
get
around
i
wish
you
would
go
directly
home
from
here
will
you
then
he
lifted
his
hat
to
her
and
sprang
into
his
carriage
and
rode
away
with
gracie
dennis
and
joy
saunders
waited
for
the
next
yellow
car
and
climbed
into
it
and
told
herself
all
the
way
down
town
that
she
wished
she
had
stayed
at
the
little
house
and
watched
all
night
by
the
sick
child
the
thoughts
that
everett
had
given
to
the
entire
matter
were
few
they
ran
somewhat
after
this
fashion
joy
here
and
i
afraid
of
the
fever
from
all
i
have
heard
i
shall
take
her
home
as
soon
as
possible
how
will
that
poor
little
girl
in
the
carriage
manage
with
a
new
acquaintance
just
now
i
wonder
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
quite
a
strain
still
i
can
do
the
talking
and
let
her
be
quiet
the
main
point
is
that
i
hoped
she
might
have
a
suggestion
to
make
about
hester
if
she
could
rouse
herself
to
try
to
save
that
girl
it
would
be
the
best
thing
she
could
do
if
she
only
knew
it
joy
is
the
one
who
could
help
her
in
that
direction
or
any
as
they
dashed
down
the
avenue
he
was
still
occupied
in
wishing
that
he
had
urged
joy
to
ride
and
thus
forced
an
acquaintance
between
her
and
the
pretty
girl
at
his
side
he
was
not
very
patient
with
what
he
called
the
trammels
of
society
when
there
were
two
people
so
fitted
to
enjoy
and
help
one
another
as
were
joy
saunders
and
gracie
dennis
he
held
it
to
be
a
waste
in
christian
economy
that
they
should
not
know
each
other
too
much
occupied
with
his
thoughts
and
his
driving
to
give
heed
to
he
lost
the
careful
bow
that
young
ried
had
for
them
as
they
drew
near
the
city
whirl
again
gracie
did
not
she
returned
it
with
a
color
in
her
cheeks
and
wondered
if
that
young
man
knew
professor
ellis
and
what
he
thought
of
him
and
what
he
thought
of
her
for
being
acquainted
with
him
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
a
real
pity
that
on
occasion
there
could
not
be
some
way
of
looking
into
one
another
thoughts
so
many
misunderstandings
might
thus
be
saved
for
instance
there
was
ried
who
went
on
his
way
with
a
clouded
brow
where
had
everett
been
and
why
was
gracie
dennis
with
him
was
it
probable
that
he
had
been
riding
for
pleasure
the
bare
suggestion
astonished
the
young
man
he
found
that
he
had
never
before
given
room
to
the
thought
that
everett
took
time
for
pleasure
allowing
this
to
be
the
case
why
had
he
not
taken
joy
saunders
with
him
such
a
proceeding
would
have
seemed
altogether
natural
though
the
young
fellow
admitted
to
himself
that
had
he
been
taking
a
ride
for
pleasure
the
companion
of
his
choice
would
not
have
been
joy
saunders
it
was
certainly
a
bewildering
world
so
trying
did
young
ried
find
his
thoughts
on
that
evening
that
he
actually
set
himself
deliberately
to
learn
whether
the
ride
was
the
result
of
chance
or
design
the
consequence
was
that
he
learned
not
only
of
the
ride
but
of
the
afternoon
entertainment
at
seltzer
hall
with
glass
goblets
for
instruments
this
increased
his
astonishment
and
did
not
lessen
the
gloom
on
his
face
but
the
two
in
the
carriage
unconscious
of
the
gloomy
young
man
or
of
the
young
girl
riding
in
a
were
almost
silent
during
the
homeward
ride
until
just
as
they
turned
into
the
avenue
that
led
to
roberts
door
then
grace
said
dr
everett
i
should
like
to
know
that
girl
there
are
some
things
that
i
ought
to
say
to
her
and
if
i
had
a
chance
i
would
try
to
say
them
in
a
way
to
help
i
will
manage
it
said
everett
speaking
in
a
quick
relieved
tone
he
felt
encouraged
for
hester
now
and
greatly
relieved
about
gracie
she
might
be
wounded
but
she
was
made
of
the
material
of
which
he
had
hoped
she
was
not
going
to
die
herself
nor
fold
her
hands
and
see
others
ruined
merely
because
she
had
been
deceived
he
bade
her
a
cheery
good
afternoon
and
drove
away
feeling
that
although
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
sewell
alley
good
work
had
been
accomplished
he
believed
now
that
he
understood
the
situation
he
was
right
about
one
thing
gracie
dennis
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
dying
her
mood
was
better
expressed
half
an
hour
later
when
she
stood
at
the
parlor
window
and
returned
a
low
lingering
bow
from
professor
ellis
with
a
haughty
stare
from
flashing
eyes
looking
out
from
an
erect
and
motionless
head
dirk
colson
brain
was
in
a
whirl
he
had
an
important
question
to
settle
in
his
pocket
were
two
blue
tickets
promising
to
admit
him
to
the
largest
and
finest
hall
in
the
city
to
hear
the
great
temperance
orator
dirk
knew
very
little
about
orators
but
he
had
heard
of
john
gough
and
everything
he
had
heard
made
him
wish
to
have
a
glimpse
of
him
you
will
remember
that
dirk
was
an
imitator
he
had
heard
that
gough
was
also
and
down
deep
in
his
heart
the
boy
had
an
ambition
to
hear
the
man
now
was
his
unexpected
opportunity
of
course
he
was
going
but
the
perplexing
thing
was
what
to
do
with
that
other
ticket
there
was
mart
oh
yes
to
be
sure
he
had
not
forgotten
her
but
what
a
strange
thing
it
would
be
to
take
her
to
a
lecture
he
had
never
taken
her
anywhere
in
his
life
she
had
nothing
to
wear
though
he
remembered
at
that
moment
that
the
mother
had
by
earnest
effort
succeeded
in
getting
her
shawl
out
of
pawn
there
was
one
incentive
for
taking
her
it
would
please
roberts
dirk
studied
the
thing
for
some
time
to
try
to
discover
why
she
should
care
and
had
finally
given
up
the
problem
as
too
great
for
him
yet
he
was
sure
she
cared
there
had
been
a
wistful
light
in
her
eyes
when
she
said
i
thought
possibly
you
might
like
to
take
that
sister
with
the
golden
hair
that
he
saw
and
interpreted
it
took
him
three
days
to
decide
what
he
should
say
supposing
he
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
her
several
people
were
at
work
helping
him
though
he
knew
nothing
about
that
roberts
remarked
one
evening
to
young
ried
that
she
wished
she
knew
a
way
to
induce
dirk
colson
to
take
his
sister
without
actually
asking
him
to
do
so
she
fancied
that
besides
the
advantage
which
might
possibly
directly
follow
an
evening
spent
in
that
way
it
would
suggest
new
thoughts
to
the
brother
the
young
man
caught
at
the
suggestion
and
wanted
to
help
carry
it
out
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
he
had
not
grown
intimate
with
dirk
colson
in
fact
that
misguided
young
fellow
rather
resented
any
attempt
at
intimacy
he
was
however
acquainted
with
sallie
calkins
the
numerous
trips
he
had
made
to
their
room
during
mark
illness
had
brought
him
into
such
constant
and
pleasant
contact
with
sallie
and
her
brother
that
they
looked
upon
him
as
a
tried
friend
sallie
he
knew
was
a
friend
of
the
shy
sister
so
one
evening
he
went
to
call
at
the
calkins
room
with
a
vague
hope
of
helping
indirectly
in
bringing
to
pass
roberts
desires
to
sallie
he
made
known
the
wish
that
dirk
would
take
his
sister
to
the
lecture
and
secured
from
her
a
promise
to
help
the
scheme
along
provided
it
developed
after
he
went
away
sallie
sat
long
at
her
sewing
making
all
alone
by
a
dim
light
one
of
the
most
heroic
little
sacrifices
that
was
ever
offered
in
his
to
fully
understand
it
you
must
know
that
mark
calkins
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
take
his
place
in
the
office
where
everett
had
secured
him
an
opening
and
an
employment
that
would
enable
him
to
sit
most
of
the
time
thereby
giving
his
injured
limb
a
chance
to
rest
also
mark
had
been
admitted
to
the
monday
evening
gatherings
and
was
distinguishing
himself
there
by
his
skill
in
reading
and
writing
of
course
he
had
received
two
tickets
and
equally
of
course
being
the
boy
he
was
he
had
planned
to
take
sallie
with
him
to
the
lecture
great
was
sallie
prospective
pleasure
the
event
of
her
lifetime
it
was
to
be
to
walk
with
mark
through
the
crowded
streets
both
neatly
dressed
to
walk
boldly
forward
with
the
throng
and
present
their
tickets
of
admittance
to
the
great
hall
hitherto
seen
only
from
the
outside
to
move
down
the
long
aisles
as
those
who
had
a
right
and
select
their
seats
unquestioned
by
police
in
short
to
be
like
other
people
part
of
the
great
world
this
was
sallie
joy
she
had
washed
and
mended
her
best
calico
dress
she
had
sewed
buttons
on
the
pretty
cape
according
to
roberts
directions
she
had
tried
on
the
neat
bonnet
which
had
been
manufactured
for
her
by
own
fingers
and
altogether
sallie
had
probably
gotten
during
these
two
days
more
enjoyment
out
of
gough
lecture
than
many
others
who
had
heard
him
a
dozen
times
ever
secured
i
do
not
think
it
any
wonder
that
as
she
rocked
and
sewed
and
thought
out
her
great
thought
there
fell
tears
on
the
work
she
was
doing
chapter
xxiv
for
you
do
know
what
may
this
was
the
thought
suppose
dirk
colson
should
want
to
take
his
sister
sallie
did
not
believe
it
in
the
least
probable
she
had
not
that
amount
of
faith
in
dirk
colson
but
suppose
he
should
mart
could
not
go
for
the
reason
that
she
would
have
nothing
to
wear
and
here
was
sallie
pretty
cape
which
would
cover
the
worst
of
her
dress
and
her
pretty
bonnet
which
she
knew
would
make
a
picture
of
mart
but
if
she
lent
them
it
meant
staying
at
home
to
sallie
she
do
it
could
she
bear
to
think
of
such
a
thing
what
would
mark
say
what
would
he
do
with
his
other
ticket
would
she
be
likely
ever
to
have
another
chance
to
go
to
that
wonderful
hall
and
be
like
other
folks
but
had
never
been
anywhere
in
her
life
and
i
said
poor
sallie
catching
her
breath
with
a
sob
have
been
often
for
a
walk
on
the
brightest
streets
and
looked
in
at
the
shop
windows
and
everything
i
know
i
will
help
her
to
go
if
i
young
ried
had
no
conception
of
the
sacrifice
for
which
he
had
asked
it
is
little
wonder
surely
that
sallie
voice
faltered
that
same
evening
as
she
explained
to
mart
who
had
slipped
in
for
a
bit
of
talk
that
if
ever
she
wanted
to
go
anywhere
very
bad
she
was
to
let
sallie
know
and
she
should
have
her
cape
and
bonnet
to
wear
then
she
had
anxiously
planned
for
her
a
way
to
mend
her
dress
so
that
it
would
look
quite
well
under
the
cape
and
she
had
even
urged
now
do
mart
if
anybody
should
want
you
to
go
do
say
you
wo
but
take
your
chance
for
you
do
know
what
may
also
she
bore
with
patience
mart
scornful
laugh
and
emphatic
statement
that
no
chances
ever
came
to
her
and
nobody
ever
wanted
her
to
go
anywhere
as
she
talked
she
grew
interested
and
eloquent
urged
earnestly
that
mart
should
embrace
the
first
opportunity
to
go
somewhere
and
wear
her
new
cape
and
bonnet
at
the
same
time
she
was
silent
about
the
lecture
suppose
no
chance
should
come
then
it
would
be
doubly
hard
to
mart
to
have
had
the
possibility
suggested
the
same
delicate
reasoning
had
held
her
from
dwelling
on
her
own
prospects
some
people
would
have
been
very
much
astonished
over
the
amount
of
delicate
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
which
could
be
found
in
that
little
room
dirk
loitered
strangely
over
his
meagre
dinner
the
next
afternoon
it
was
late
for
he
had
secured
a
position
at
last
in
one
of
the
printing
offices
and
was
apt
to
take
his
meals
at
any
hour
when
it
happened
to
be
convenient
to
do
without
him
at
the
office
he
had
only
been
three
days
at
work
and
mart
had
taken
little
notice
of
the
new
departure
except
to
remark
grimly
that
it
would
not
last
but
to
sallie
she
had
boasted
that
dirk
had
gone
to
work
as
hard
as
anybody
if
somebody
could
only
have
told
dirk
that
his
sister
ever
boasted
of
him
it
might
have
helped
him
much
during
these
days
what
are
you
hanging
around
for
you
got
all
there
will
be
to
eat
in
this
house
and
it
is
time
you
were
this
was
the
ungracious
manner
in
which
the
sister
took
note
of
his
lingering
she
was
painfully
afraid
that
he
had
already
grown
weary
of
regular
employment
and
the
fear
made
her
voice
gruffer
than
usual
his
reply
amazed
her
in
fact
it
amazed
himself
mart
i
got
tickets
to
a
show
a
nice
place
and
i
want
you
to
go
humph
said
mart
that
is
a
likely
story
then
he
grew
earnest
displayed
his
treasures
and
urged
her
acceptance
quite
astonished
with
himself
the
while
he
really
want
her
to
go
he
wondered
or
did
he
want
to
please
roberts
you
would
have
been
interested
an
hour
later
to
have
seen
mart
skip
up
the
rickety
stairs
leading
to
the
calkins
abode
you
would
probably
have
thought
that
she
endangered
life
or
limb
by
her
rapid
movements
but
mart
was
used
to
such
staircases
and
the
news
she
had
to
communicate
required
haste
there
a
chance
she
said
breathless
with
speed
and
eagerness
sallie
calkins
there
a
chance
and
you
never
guess
how
dirk
he
wants
me
to
go
to
a
show
with
him
this
very
night
he
got
tickets
it
is
a
big
show
where
all
the
grand
folks
go
it
is
in
the
very
biggest
hall
in
this
city
and
dirk
he
says
i
am
to
go
sallie
calkins
do
you
mean
it
truly
that
i
am
to
wear
your
lovely
new
bonnet
and
cape
do
you
suppose
i
can
really
go
anywhere
i
do
known
why
dirk
wants
me
to
so
bad
but
he
coaxed
and
poor
sallie
she
stooped
quickly
to
pick
up
a
pin
from
the
floor
so
that
mart
might
not
get
a
glimpse
of
her
eyes
with
the
sudden
tears
in
them
yet
as
she
stooped
she
made
her
final
grand
sacrifice
mart
should
go
then
she
entered
with
entire
abandon
into
the
preparations
not
only
her
bonnet
and
cape
but
her
shoes
new
ones
that
mark
had
bought
her
with
his
first
earnings
after
his
illness
were
to
attend
the
lecture
she
rejoiced
over
the
excellent
fit
of
the
shoes
she
did
more
than
this
as
mart
watched
the
process
of
buttoning
them
and
remarked
complacently
that
she
should
wonder
if
dirk
would
buy
her
a
pair
some
day
when
he
earned
money
enough
she
kept
her
lip
from
curling
with
an
incredulous
sneer
you
will
remember
that
she
had
not
the
slightest
faith
in
dirk
neither
must
i
forget
that
there
was
another
thing
to
lend
her
comb
in
order
that
mart
wonderful
yellow
hair
might
be
for
once
reduced
to
something
like
order
and
at
the
risk
of
leading
you
to
think
that
sallie
was
altogether
too
aesthetic
for
her
position
in
life
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
this
was
her
hardest
bit
of
sacrifice
her
comb
was
so
new
and
so
pretty
however
it
did
its
duty
on
mart
tawny
locks
and
the
transforming
effect
was
marvellous
in
fact
when
all
was
ready
the
cape
adjusted
the
hat
which
roberts
had
shown
her
how
to
wear
set
on
the
yellow
head
sallie
said
not
a
word
but
went
to
the
in
the
corner
which
served
as
a
treasure
cupboard
and
drew
forth
the
one
possession
about
which
she
had
been
utterly
silent
a
little
which
mark
had
brought
her
one
winter
evening
just
before
he
was
hurt
a
cheap
little
ugly
glass
which
you
would
have
turned
from
in
disgust
saying
that
it
made
your
nose
awry
and
your
chin
protrude
and
your
eyes
squint
and
was
altogether
horrid
but
held
before
mart
glowing
face
what
a
secret
did
it
reveal
mart
looked
and
was
silent
too
and
went
home
in
a
hushed
frame
of
mind
to
wait
for
dirk
home
was
deserted
the
mother
had
dragged
her
wearied
body
out
for
a
day
of
light
work
the
time
had
gone
by
when
she
was
able
to
do
any
that
people
called
heavy
where
the
father
was
none
of
the
family
knew
and
their
chief
hope
concerning
him
was
that
he
would
stay
away
as
long
as
possible
i
find
myself
longing
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
that
elegant
brilliantly
lighted
hall
with
its
brilliant
audience
was
to
this
girl
and
being
unable
to
do
it
when
people
live
so
far
below
us
that
our
experiences
are
to
them
like
a
day
at
the
world
fair
it
is
very
hard
indeed
to
describe
how
our
special
treats
affect
them
it
is
a
treat
to
everybody
to
hear
gough
how
then
can
i
tell
you
what
it
was
to
this
girl
and
her
brother
dirk
listened
he
must
have
listened
well
for
long
afterward
he
was
able
to
repeat
entire
paragraphs
and
to
imitate
the
manner
of
the
great
orator
with
remarkable
skill
yet
at
the
time
he
would
have
seemed
to
a
close
watcher
to
have
been
absorbed
in
another
way
he
looked
at
mart
somewhat
as
he
had
on
that
sabbath
when
his
acquaintance
with
roberts
began
but
the
thought
which
had
dimly
haunted
him
that
day
blossomed
on
this
evening
certainly
mart
looked
like
roberts
it
might
be
folly
to
think
so
doubtless
the
fellows
would
make
no
end
of
fun
of
him
if
he
should
ever
tell
them
so
which
he
meant
to
take
excellent
care
not
to
do
but
the
fact
remained
that
in
sallie
bonnet
and
cape
and
above
all
with
the
waves
of
hair
floating
about
her
there
was
a
look
which
instantly
and
strongly
reminded
him
of
that
lady
there
was
another
listener
at
the
lecture
who
was
unexpectedly
present
part
of
poor
sallie
trial
had
been
to
tell
her
brother
who
had
been
radiant
for
a
week
over
the
prospect
of
taking
her
that
she
had
with
her
own
hand
put
away
the
blessing
how
would
mark
take
it
sister
was
no
favorite
of
his
i
think
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
have
convinced
him
that
there
was
a
trace
of
roberts
in
her
face
but
such
curious
creatures
are
we
that
it
actually
hurt
sallie
to
see
how
quietly
he
took
the
great
sad
news
of
her
sacrifice
after
the
first
start
of
surprise
he
seemed
preoccupied
and
she
could
almost
have
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
her
explanation
she
had
much
ado
to
keep
back
the
tears
but
she
had
made
a
special
little
feast
for
him
that
evening
with
a
white
cloth
on
the
table
and
a
cup
of
actual
tea
and
the
cup
set
in
a
saucer
she
was
not
going
to
spoil
the
scene
with
tears
so
after
a
little
she
said
cheerily
now
you
have
a
chance
to
do
something
nice
for
somebody
who
will
you
take
on
your
ticket
i
was
thinking
he
answered
slowly
you
know
it
is
a
temperance
lecture
and
it
is
by
a
wonderful
man
the
fellows
in
the
shop
have
been
talking
about
him
all
day
and
they
say
you
just
ca
help
when
he
gets
agoing
and
i
was
just
thinking
what
if
we
could
get
to
go
and
he
would
listen
and
get
to
there
are
no
italics
that
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
peculiar
emphasis
which
the
boy
put
on
the
pronouns
sallie
understood
that
he
could
mean
but
one
person
in
the
world
but
her
brother
must
have
answered
the
look
on
her
face
for
she
spoke
no
word
sometimes
they
sallie
there
was
old
pete
you
oh
yes
sallie
knew
old
pete
every
body
in
that
alley
knew
him
a
notorious
drunkard
once
of
the
sort
which
people
even
good
christian
people
are
apt
to
pronounce
hopeless
yet
now
he
wore
a
neat
suit
of
clothes
every
day
and
brought
home
twenty
pounds
of
flour
at
one
time
in
a
sack
and
bought
his
coal
by
the
barrel
wonderful
things
occasionally
happened
in
that
alley
yes
said
sally
that
is
true
and
old
pete
was
much
like
the
tone
spoke
volumes
it
would
have
almost
angered
her
even
now
to
have
had
it
hinted
that
old
pete
was
superior
to
that
father
though
hardly
a
person
acquainted
with
the
two
but
would
have
said
that
there
was
more
hope
for
old
pete
even
in
his
miserable
past
than
for
this
one
how
they
managed
it
those
two
the
difficult
task
of
getting
him
persuaded
to
go
find
then
the
more
difficult
task
of
keeping
him
sufficiently
sober
to
get
there
would
make
a
story
in
itself
i
fancy
there
are
many
such
stories
in
real
life
which
will
never
get
told
the
probabilities
are
if
they
were
some
wise
critic
would
pronounce
them
unnatural
and
sensational
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
task
was
accomplished
and
among
the
most
attentive
listeners
to
the
great
speaker
that
evening
was
father
while
she
sat
at
home
and
mended
a
badly
torn
jacket
and
cried
now
and
then
and
was
glad
and
sorry
and
proud
and
frightened
and
hopeful
by
turns
all
that
long
evening
i
am
not
sure
but
it
was
better
for
her
that
she
sat
at
home
i
know
just
what
she
might
have
done
had
she
been
in
the
hall
to
see
her
father
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
shamble
forward
with
the
crowd
and
sign
his
name
to
the
total
abstinence
pledge
she
might
have
screamed
out
in
her
excitement
or
she
might
have
fainted
for
although
there
were
those
who
said
some
with
a
sneer
and
some
with
a
sigh
that
signing
the
pledge
would
not
amount
to
anything
the
miserable
fellow
could
not
keep
a
pledge
to
save
his
life
sally
would
have
thought
nothing
of
the
kind
she
had
faith
in
her
word
it
is
a
wonderful
stimulus
to
have
some
one
who
believes
in
us
chapter
xxv
what
do
you
hope
to
accomplish
do
you
know
said
roberts
addressing
gracie
dennis
who
with
young
ried
had
waited
in
the
hall
for
her
to
join
them
they
were
ready
for
the
lecture
and
were
to
take
up
roberts
on
the
way
do
you
know
that
i
have
a
desire
which
i
see
no
way
of
realizing
if
colson
should
bring
his
sister
with
him
i
should
like
so
much
to
get
possession
of
her
and
bring
her
home
with
me
but
i
have
been
planning
all
day
and
see
no
possible
excuse
for
such
an
apparently
wild
i
want
you
to
notice
how
naturally
roberts
said
mr
colson
she
never
talked
about
dirk
under
any
other
name
she
even
taught
herself
to
of
him
as
mr
consequently
when
she
spoke
the
name
in
his
presence
there
was
not
a
trace
of
unnaturalness
in
tone
or
manner
the
others
tried
in
vain
to
follow
her
example
everett
could
not
speak
of
him
in
this
way
without
slight
hesitation
and
a
touch
of
embarrassment
the
truth
is
said
he
i
think
all
the
week
and
on
the
sabbath
i
find
it
impossible
to
reach
up
to
without
an
there
was
no
touch
of
reaching
up
or
reaching
down
about
roberts
talk
with
her
pupils
it
is
possible
that
this
is
one
link
in
the
chain
of
influence
which
she
was
weaving
around
them
gracie
dennis
face
expressed
curiosity
and
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
she
referred
to
the
cause
but
flossy
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
want
to
do
such
a
thing
it
will
certainly
be
too
late
to
try
to
get
acquainted
with
her
i
should
think
some
time
when
you
could
have
an
unbroken
evening
would
be
the
better
for
for
some
sorts
of
experimenting
it
would
roberts
answered
smiling
quietly
my
experiment
in
part
at
least
was
to
see
how
the
pink
room
might
impress
flossy
shipley
when
gracie
took
refuge
in
that
name
her
hostess
knew
she
was
not
only
much
excited
but
a
trifle
disapproving
at
such
times
she
made
haste
to
change
the
subject
it
happened
that
the
thing
for
which
she
had
been
planning
shaped
itself
so
naturally
as
to
give
not
the
slightest
color
or
premeditation
to
the
act
when
dirk
and
his
sister
worked
their
way
through
the
dense
crowds
to
the
open
air
they
discovered
that
it
was
raining
heavily
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
fact
struck
terror
to
mart
colson
soul
ordinarily
no
duck
could
have
been
more
indifferent
to
a
rain
storm
than
herself
on
this
evening
she
gave
vent
to
her
dismay
in
short
expressive
words
sallie
bonnet
and
cape
this
last
after
a
moment
thought
and
shoes
she
added
as
the
magnitude
of
her
troubles
grew
upon
her
drawn
up
close
to
the
sidewalk
stood
a
carriage
and
a
pair
of
horses
that
dirk
could
not
help
giving
admiring
attention
to
despite
the
rain
a
fine
horse
always
held
his
attention
no
thought
of
the
occupants
of
the
carriage
came
to
him
not
even
after
a
head
leaned
forward
and
a
hand
beckoned
of
course
it
was
beckoning
to
somebody
else
then
a
clear
voice
spoke
mr
colson
he
started
quickly
forward
there
was
but
one
person
who
ever
said
mr
colson
and
besides
that
voice
belonged
only
to
one
i
want
your
sister
to
go
home
with
me
it
is
raining
so
hard
that
she
ought
not
to
walk
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
her
stay
with
me
wo
you
ask
her
to
please
if
roberts
had
been
asking
a
favor
instead
of
conferring
one
her
voice
could
not
have
been
sweeter
and
more
winning
dirk
went
back
to
his
sister
too
much
bewildered
by
the
state
of
affairs
even
to
express
surprise
mart
he
said
she
wants
a
quick
spring
to
the
sidewalk
and
young
ried
was
standing
beside
mart
it
is
raining
so
hard
he
explained
mrs
roberts
would
be
very
glad
if
you
would
and
mart
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
save
sallie
bonnet
and
cape
and
shoes
turned
toward
the
waiting
carriage
ried
had
his
umbrella
raised
and
carefully
shielded
the
bonnet
assisting
its
wearer
to
enter
the
carriage
with
as
much
courtesy
as
he
had
bestowed
on
gracie
dennis
but
a
few
moments
before
not
a
movement
was
lost
on
the
watching
dirk
when
the
door
was
closed
and
the
goodnights
had
been
said
roberts
leaning
from
the
carriage
again
for
that
purpose
and
when
the
horses
had
dashed
around
the
corner
he
still
occupied
his
position
on
the
curbstone
gazing
down
the
street
gazing
at
nothing
unless
he
saw
a
reflection
of
his
own
bewildered
thoughts
come
said
a
policeman
who
knew
him
and
was
therefore
suspicious
what
are
you
hanging
about
here
for
move
on
humph
said
dirk
as
he
slowly
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
corner
where
the
carriage
had
turned
what
if
i
should
something
in
his
eye
would
have
told
roberts
had
she
been
there
that
he
meant
more
than
moving
down
the
street
though
that
he
presently
did
regardless
of
wind
and
rain
meantime
the
bonnet
and
cape
in
the
carriage
stepped
somewhat
into
the
background
and
the
girl
who
wore
them
allowed
herself
once
more
to
think
of
her
individuality
and
to
wonder
at
her
position
she
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
edge
of
the
soft
gray
seat
and
gazed
about
her
as
well
as
she
could
by
the
glimmer
of
the
street
lamps
she
in
a
carriage
mart
colson
sitting
on
a
back
seat
beside
a
grand
lady
and
rolling
down
the
avenue
who
would
have
supposed
that
such
a
thing
could
have
happened
to
sallie
calkins
bonnet
roberts
recognized
the
bonnet
and
cape
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
she
had
studied
much
over
the
possibilities
of
this
girl
costume
was
it
probable
that
she
had
anything
suitable
to
wear
to
a
lecture
she
had
passed
the
cellar
where
the
girl
lived
but
once
and
had
had
but
one
glimpse
of
her
yet
these
glimpses
had
been
enough
to
render
it
highly
improbable
that
she
had
any
street
costume
then
had
roberts
canvassed
the
possibilities
of
getting
a
for
her
there
were
apparently
insurmountable
difficulties
in
the
way
she
was
too
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
ground
to
venture
besides
there
were
reasons
for
believing
that
anything
of
value
would
find
its
way
from
that
cellar
to
a
pawnbroker
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
having
spent
hours
over
many
different
schemes
and
rejected
each
one
as
liable
to
bring
disaster
roberts
was
obliged
to
betake
herself
to
prayer
if
the
watching
saviour
wanted
her
to
work
through
the
medium
of
this
lecture
on
this
particular
child
of
his
he
could
certainly
see
that
she
was
present
could
furnish
her
with
clothes
to
wear
either
through
herself
or
some
other
of
his
servants
she
would
wait
and
watch
not
once
had
she
thought
of
sallie
calkins
and
the
new
bonnet
that
her
own
fingers
had
helped
to
fashion
yet
here
it
was
beside
her
on
the
head
of
this
girl
toward
whom
she
was
drawn
the
fact
made
roberts
radiant
she
said
almost
nothing
to
the
startled
prisoner
at
her
side
beyond
a
murmured
so
glad
you
let
me
carry
you
home
with
me
then
she
drew
a
wrap
about
her
and
left
her
to
her
amazement
while
the
eager
tongues
of
the
rest
of
the
party
talked
continuously
by
the
way
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
pink
room
i
think
you
should
see
it
before
it
is
invaded
for
the
night
large
it
is
i
think
little
people
sometimes
have
a
peculiar
fondness
for
large
rooms
roberts
had
the
walls
were
tinted
with
what
might
be
called
a
suggestion
of
pink
with
just
a
touch
of
sunset
gold
about
the
mouldings
the
carpet
was
soft
and
rich
it
gave
back
no
sound
of
footfall
it
was
strewn
with
pink
buds
some
just
opening
into
beauty
some
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
elegant
carpets
as
you
are
you
would
almost
have
stooped
to
pick
one
of
these
buds
they
looked
so
real
the
curtains
to
the
windows
were
white
but
lined
with
rose
pink
they
were
looped
back
with
knots
of
pink
ribbons
the
bed
was
a
marvel
of
pink
and
white
drapery
so
was
the
the
were
upholstered
in
soft
grays
with
a
pinkish
tinge
and
the
tidies
lavishly
displayed
were
all
of
pink
and
white
there
was
nothing
conventional
about
the
room
a
professional
would
have
been
shocked
by
some
of
its
appointments
many
a
lady
of
wealth
accustomed
to
having
things
as
they
decree
would
have
been
more
than
doubtful
over
the
pink
ribbons
and
the
profusion
of
white
drapery
aside
from
the
carpet
and
a
choice
picture
or
two
there
was
nothing
especially
expensive
about
the
furnishings
it
was
simply
a
room
in
which
roberts
had
allowed
her
own
sweet
little
fancies
to
take
her
captive
the
gas
was
lighted
the
door
was
ajar
into
a
a
lavish
display
of
great
beautiful
towels
could
be
seen
as
you
peeped
in
and
various
touches
told
of
an
expected
guest
flowers
were
blossoming
on
the
mantel
and
a
tiny
vase
which
stood
on
a
bracket
near
the
held
a
single
rose
of
a
peculiar
hue
and
perfume
which
had
blossomed
for
this
hour
at
least
roberts
thought
so
into
this
room
in
all
its
purity
and
beauty
went
sallie
bonnet
and
cape
and
her
strong
new
thick
shoes
and
the
wearer
thereof
pushed
the
bonnet
away
from
her
flushed
face
and
stood
and
looked
about
her
down
stairs
they
discussed
in
curious
tones
not
her
but
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
flossy
i
do
think
you
are
too
queer
for
anything
why
do
you
have
her
go
to
katy
room
katy
is
away
for
the
night
you
know
and
sure
her
room
is
as
neat
and
pretty
as
can
be
imagine
what
a
contrast
it
would
be
to
anything
that
she
has
ever
seen
ried
you
ought
to
see
the
room
into
which
she
has
been
put
there
is
a
more
elegant
one
in
the
house
some
of
its
furnishings
are
so
delicate
that
i
hardly
like
to
touch
them
what
sort
of
a
disease
is
it
that
has
taken
roberts
do
you
suppose
to
send
her
there
flossy
she
will
get
no
rest
she
will
be
afraid
of
that
immaculate
this
of
course
was
gracie
dennis
roberts
looked
from
her
to
his
wife
his
face
smiling
curious
yet
with
a
sort
of
expression
what
do
you
hope
to
accomplish
flossy
he
asked
the
question
as
one
who
was
pleased
to
watch
a
new
experiment
yet
felt
sure
that
the
experimenter
had
an
end
to
attain
which
would
justify
any
measures
that
she
might
take
roberts
had
believed
in
his
wife
when
he
chose
her
from
all
others
but
he
was
learning
to
believe
in
her
in
a
peculiar
sense
as
one
led
by
a
hand
that
made
no
mistakes
she
turned
to
answer
his
question
her
face
bright
yet
half
puzzled
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
explain
to
you
what
i
hoped
for
she
said
i
caught
the
idea
from
from
me
and
the
young
man
thus
mentioned
looked
so
astonished
and
incredulous
that
gracie
laughed
he
is
sure
he
never
thought
of
anything
so
wild
she
said
gayly
flossy
you
must
find
a
better
excuse
than
yet
it
was
something
that
he
said
do
you
remember
telling
me
not
long
ago
about
your
sister
idea
that
all
the
world
had
lost
its
place
because
of
sin
that
god
intended
everything
here
to
be
beautiful
and
all
life
to
be
bright
with
joy
and
that
satan
had
gotten
hold
of
lives
and
was
trying
to
ruin
them
and
that
every
beautiful
creation
was
god
picture
to
the
world
of
what
his
intention
had
been
telling
it
poorly
but
it
made
a
very
deep
impression
this
girl
face
you
know
is
beautiful
it
is
what
god
meant
some
faces
to
be
at
least
i
mean
he
has
given
her
the
frame
for
a
face
of
beauty
i
have
a
vague
sort
of
wish
to
give
her
a
glimpse
of
harmony
something
that
will
fit
her
golden
hair
and
lovely
complexion
and
see
what
she
will
think
of
god
idea
and
whether
she
will
understand
that
it
is
sin
which
has
spoiled
it
and
whether
she
is
willing
to
serve
the
author
of
her
ruin
i
do
believe
i
am
making
myself
plain
but
i
know
what
i
mean
at
if
we
do
not
i
think
it
must
be
because
you
have
caught
a
thought
from
god
that
we
are
not
able
to
reach
up
it
was
roberts
who
made
this
reply
something
in
his
experiment
had
deeply
moved
him
as
for
ried
his
face
lighted
as
it
always
did
at
the
mention
of
his
sister
name
sometimes
i
almost
think
that
it
is
ester
still
at
work
and
that
he
lets
her
work
through
this
it
was
what
he
said
to
gracie
dennis
in
an
aside
roberts
had
already
gone
to
see
in
person
to
the
comfort
of
her
guest
chapter
xxvi
o
lord
take
dirk
too
she
found
her
standing
before
the
mirror
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
she
understood
no
pretty
trick
of
braid
or
curl
her
long
yellow
hair
hung
just
as
nature
had
made
it
with
no
waves
or
ripples
save
those
which
had
grown
with
its
growth
it
fell
about
her
now
like
a
sunset
cloud
she
had
taken
from
the
vase
near
at
hand
a
rose
which
she
had
pushed
in
among
the
masses
of
hair
with
no
knowledge
as
to
how
it
should
be
arranged
or
indeed
thought
yet
the
effect
was
something
which
made
roberts
give
an
involuntary
start
of
admiration
still
it
was
evident
that
though
apparently
gazing
at
herself
she
was
thinking
away
beyond
herself
it
is
doubtful
if
at
that
moment
she
saw
the
flower
or
her
own
reflection
or
knew
that
she
was
looking
her
eyes
had
the
faraway
expression
which
one
sometimes
sees
in
great
power
on
faces
like
hers
she
turned
as
roberts
having
softly
knocked
and
received
no
answer
softly
entered
and
her
first
words
indicated
the
intensity
of
her
thought
whatever
it
was
dirk
has
to
go
there
go
where
asked
roberts
startled
out
of
the
words
she
meant
to
speak
startled
by
the
hint
of
power
in
the
voice
and
manner
of
whom
are
you
thinking
my
dear
girl
and
where
do
you
want
him
to
go
i
thinking
about
dirk
i
thought
about
him
all
the
evening
the
man
made
me
and
i
made
up
my
mind
he
to
go
to
heaven
i
suppose
i
can
not
give
you
an
idea
of
the
force
in
her
voice
it
was
as
though
a
resolution
from
which
there
could
be
no
appeal
had
been
taken
and
the
person
resolving
felt
her
own
power
to
accomplish
it
was
altogether
an
unexpected
answer
to
roberts
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
or
to
laugh
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
to
study
the
girl
and
consider
what
answer
to
make
mart
meantime
turned
back
to
the
survey
of
herself
in
the
mirror
or
to
the
survey
of
whatever
she
saw
there
and
continued
talking
i
never
knew
much
about
heaven
you
may
guess
that
if
you
have
ever
been
in
our
alley
only
lately
sallie
calkins
she
been
telling
me
what
you
told
her
and
i
had
a
kind
of
notion
that
you
must
know
what
you
was
talking
about
and
that
it
was
for
rich
folks
and
grand
folks
like
you
but
the
man
told
about
that
madge
you
know
an
awful
drunkard
and
swearer
and
all
that
how
she
reformed
and
went
to
heaven
dirk
ai
no
drunkard
but
he
will
be
everybody
says
he
will
because
father
is
such
an
awful
one
mother
she
never
had
no
hope
of
him
she
says
father
did
drink
till
he
was
most
twenty
and
then
he
begun
and
she
looking
for
dirk
to
begin
and
i
have
thought
he
could
help
it
either
what
if
he
does
care
for
it
much
yet
he
will
it
likely
i
never
told
nobody
that
not
even
sallie
and
i
been
mad
at
mother
every
time
she
said
any
such
thing
but
all
the
time
been
expecting
him
to
begin
and
i
know
well
enough
when
once
they
how
it
goes
on
but
that
man
told
things
that
made
a
difference
he
says
that
god
can
keep
them
from
wanting
to
drink
and
help
them
right
straight
along
and
that
they
can
go
to
heaven
as
well
as
the
next
one
i
wanted
nice
things
for
dirk
all
my
life
but
i
never
saw
no
way
to
get
them
and
it
made
me
mad
i
saw
a
way
but
i
never
had
no
kind
of
a
notion
how
heaven
looked
till
i
come
into
this
room
and
see
the
light
and
the
flowers
and
the
shine
and
another
room
spread
out
there
in
the
glass
and
now
i
know
and
dirk
shall
go
roberts
was
in
no
mood
for
laughing
the
tears
were
dropping
slowly
on
the
flower
she
held
in
her
hand
mart
saw
in
the
glass
just
then
a
sight
which
seemed
to
add
to
her
surprise
she
turned
wondering
eyes
on
her
hostess
what
are
you
crying
for
she
asked
do
spoil
the
flower
it
is
like
the
one
dirk
bought
me
once
he
said
you
sent
it
to
me
i
kept
it
most
a
week
i
took
it
over
to
sallie
and
she
got
fresh
water
for
it
every
day
somehow
and
it
was
then
she
begun
to
tell
me
what
you
said
about
heaven
and
i
thought
if
god
had
made
such
flowers
as
that
for
you
it
was
likely
he
had
made
a
heaven
for
you
but
i
did
believe
it
was
for
dirk
till
and
i
did
have
no
kind
of
a
notion
how
it
looked
till
just
now
do
you
what
that
man
said
that
folks
like
dirk
can
go
of
course
if
madge
went
why
dirk
would
have
a
he
is
bad
just
because
he
to
be
he
never
had
no
chance
to
be
anything
else
and
he
ai
very
bad
anyhow
nothing
to
compare
with
her
voice
was
almost
fierce
in
its
earnestness
she
was
beginning
to
resent
the
creeping
doubt
that
roberts
silence
suggested
careful
words
must
be
spoken
now
what
if
this
awakening
soul
should
be
turned
aside
no
wonder
that
the
unspoken
words
were
prayers
dirk
has
a
to
go
to
heaven
she
said
steadily
sweetly
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
his
right
no
one
in
the
world
not
satan
himself
can
deprive
him
of
it
and
it
is
not
only
his
but
his
duty
to
then
he
shall
i
wish
i
could
give
you
an
idea
of
the
strength
in
the
girl
voice
it
almost
carried
conviction
with
it
to
roberts
heart
come
and
sit
down
she
said
and
she
drew
her
towards
one
of
the
low
cushions
if
mart
sat
on
that
her
head
would
be
just
where
a
gentle
hand
could
stroke
the
masses
of
hair
let
me
talk
with
you
about
this
you
are
mistaken
in
one
thing
dirk
is
very
bad
he
is
bad
enough
to
shut
him
out
of
heaven
the
girl
started
and
tried
to
fling
off
the
caressing
hand
so
are
you
said
the
gentle
voice
oh
do
talk
about
me
whoever
said
i
was
bad
let
me
go
i
want
to
go
home
i
do
care
how
hard
it
and
so
am
i
continued
the
gentle
voice
the
girl
on
the
cushion
ceased
struggling
to
free
herself
from
the
caressing
touch
and
remained
motionless
let
me
tell
you
of
something
that
we
have
each
done
a
great
many
times
we
have
been
asked
and
urged
and
coaxed
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
to
accept
an
invitation
to
go
to
this
very
heaven
and
we
have
paid
no
attention
at
all
and
this
after
jesus
christ
had
given
his
life
to
make
a
way
for
us
to
go
is
not
that
being
bad
dirk
he
never
had
no
invitation
never
heard
anything
about
yes
he
has
speaking
with
quiet
firmness
the
lord
jesus
christ
told
me
to
invite
him
and
i
have
done
so
a
great
many
times
and
he
has
made
no
answer
and
sallie
calkins
has
invited
you
and
you
have
treated
it
in
just
the
same
i
did
believe
is
that
being
bad
what
has
he
ever
done
that
you
should
refuse
to
believe
his
word
when
he
died
an
awful
death
to
prove
to
you
that
he
was
in
earnest
you
said
dirk
had
a
to
so
he
has
jesus
christ
has
given
him
a
right
if
he
will
i
have
invited
you
to
my
house
and
asked
you
to
spend
the
night
in
this
room
and
sleep
in
this
bed
has
any
person
a
right
to
keep
you
from
doing
so
an
emphatic
nod
of
the
head
and
a
lingering
almost
loving
look
at
the
white
bed
behind
her
then
can
not
you
truthfully
say
that
you
have
a
to
be
here
my
dear
girl
it
is
so
faint
an
illustration
of
what
jesus
christ
has
done
to
give
you
a
right
to
heaven
that
i
almost
wonder
at
your
understanding
it
but
can
you
imagine
something
of
how
i
should
have
felt
had
i
urged
you
to
come
to
me
night
after
night
for
weeks
and
years
and
you
had
turned
from
me
with
no
answer
or
else
with
scorn
you
would
have
kept
on
asking
mart
spoke
with
the
assurance
of
one
who
had
firm
faith
in
her
statement
no
i
presume
i
should
not
i
would
have
said
after
the
third
or
fourth
invitation
she
really
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
me
i
can
not
help
it
and
i
should
have
tried
to
forget
you
this
is
one
of
the
many
differences
between
christ
and
me
he
waits
and
asks
and
how
long
will
you
keep
him
waiting
i
have
given
you
only
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
it
was
long
ere
it
was
concluded
down
stairs
ried
waited
as
long
as
he
could
curious
to
know
the
result
of
mart
first
impressions
then
he
went
away
and
gracie
went
to
her
room
and
the
house
settled
into
quiet
and
roberts
in
the
library
waited
for
his
wife
while
she
told
over
again
with
tender
words
and
simple
illustrations
the
old
old
story
so
fitted
to
the
wants
of
the
world
how
many
times
has
there
been
a
like
result
it
was
midnight
when
they
knelt
together
the
fair
child
of
luxury
and
the
child
of
poverty
but
the
saviour
who
intercedes
for
both
bent
his
ear
and
heard
again
the
cry
of
a
groping
soul
seeking
him
out
of
darkness
and
held
out
his
loving
arms
able
to
reach
down
to
her
depth
and
received
her
to
himself
who
can
tell
that
story
who
can
describe
how
heaven
seemed
to
the
girl
just
then
it
was
not
what
roberts
had
expected
i
can
not
even
say
that
it
was
what
she
had
hoped
for
her
faith
had
not
reached
to
such
a
height
at
all
she
could
hardly
have
put
into
words
what
she
hoped
when
she
ventured
to
try
to
tell
it
to
the
friends
in
the
parlor
and
to
you
i
doubt
whether
you
understood
she
thought
to
get
a
hold
on
the
girl
to
show
her
something
of
god
beauty
and
love
as
it
shone
through
herself
to
make
her
long
after
something
her
life
did
not
give
and
to
gradually
lead
her
to
seek
after
satisfaction
in
christ
a
long
process
something
that
should
unfold
gradually
with
many
discouraging
drawbacks
and
some
days
that
would
look
like
utter
failures
she
had
schooled
herself
to
be
prepared
for
this
but
she
had
not
looked
for
him
to
exert
his
mighty
power
to
save
in
a
moment
how
it
had
touched
her
to
find
a
soul
hungry
not
for
itself
but
for
a
brother
i
shall
not
attempt
to
tell
the
first
words
she
said
after
she
went
back
to
her
waiting
husband
a
little
after
midnight
were
these
he
could
not
do
many
mighty
works
there
because
of
their
unbelief
i
think
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
the
world
i
wonder
if
he
would
not
be
pleased
with
one
who
could
throw
herself
at
his
feet
with
a
childlike
abandon
of
faith
and
expect
wonders
yes
and
impossibilities
just
as
a
child
feels
that
can
be
done
by
father
god
has
shamed
my
faith
it
is
as
though
i
had
asked
for
a
crumb
of
bread
and
he
gave
me
the
entire
loaf
that
girl
has
not
heard
of
him
before
as
a
saviour
for
has
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
or
at
least
dreamed
of
its
possibility
and
yet
she
has
given
herself
to
him
and
evan
what
do
you
think
were
the
first
words
she
said
lord
take
dirk
too
she
is
on
her
knees
at
this
moment
praying
for
him
if
you
could
have
seen
her
face
when
it
first
dawned
upon
her
that
she
could
tell
god
about
him
and
ask
for
his
mighty
power
to
be
exerted
in
his
behalf
it
would
have
been
a
picture
for
your
lifetime
oh
evan
evan
why
can
we
not
expect
great
things
of
god
chapter
xxvii
an
awful
problem
is
it
strange
the
ways
the
lord
takes
to
answer
prayers
much
prayer
had
been
made
for
dirk
colson
but
few
had
thought
of
his
sister
sallie
calkins
it
is
true
had
come
with
trembling
steps
into
the
light
of
christ
love
and
had
immediately
desired
to
have
mart
enjoy
it
with
her
but
was
very
trembling
and
doubting
as
to
her
ability
to
reach
mart
or
to
influence
her
in
the
right
direction
she
sent
the
bonnet
and
cape
to
the
lecture
with
a
prayer
but
she
did
not
look
for
the
prayer
to
be
answered
verily
he
has
to
be
content
with
faith
less
than
a
grain
of
was
the
rest
of
the
story
an
answer
to
prayer
we
are
to
remember
that
he
has
strange
ways
events
startling
enough
in
their
import
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
in
the
first
place
dirk
father
poor
wrecked
man
returned
no
more
whether
he
had
wandered
among
the
network
of
railroads
which
lined
the
southern
portion
of
the
city
and
lost
his
life
there
or
whether
he
had
fallen
into
the
river
or
just
how
he
had
disappeared
could
not
be
discovered
there
were
three
men
killed
by
an
accident
on
the
road
one
night
but
their
disfigured
bodies
were
buried
before
dirk
heard
of
it
there
was
a
man
seen
struggling
in
the
water
off
the
lower
wharf
one
evening
but
he
sank
before
help
could
reach
him
and
his
body
was
not
recovered
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
killed
by
a
boiler
explosion
but
that
was
not
heard
of
in
time
to
look
into
it
there
were
so
many
ways
in
which
the
wreck
might
have
gone
out
of
life
and
left
no
sign
they
were
safe
in
supposing
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
that
was
about
all
they
could
be
perfectly
sure
of
concerning
him
that
and
the
fact
that
he
came
no
more
of
course
there
was
no
such
search
for
him
as
is
made
for
the
man
of
respectability
and
position
to
one
who
had
some
idea
of
the
worth
of
a
soul
it
was
pitiful
to
see
what
a
tiny
ripple
this
disappearance
made
on
the
surface
of
life
a
moment
of
startled
questioning
by
those
who
lived
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
a
few
women
with
aprons
thrown
over
their
heads
congregating
in
groups
around
the
pump
or
before
the
door
of
the
bakery
a
crowd
of
dirty
children
stopping
their
play
for
a
moment
and
speaking
lower
then
the
tide
of
noisy
fighting
swearing
life
went
on
one
was
gone
out
from
it
whither
none
knew
few
cared
and
there
were
such
crowds
and
left
how
could
he
be
missed
one
missed
him
an
abused
insulted
downtrodden
woman
one
whom
years
before
he
had
promised
to
love
and
cherish
until
death
parted
them
and
had
broken
the
vows
almost
as
soon
as
taken
and
never
renewed
them
again
yet
that
woman
wept
bitter
tears
over
his
absence
watched
for
him
listened
nightly
for
his
staggering
footsteps
rose
up
from
her
heap
of
straw
in
the
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
set
wide
open
the
cellar
door
and
listened
to
the
angry
voices
floating
down
to
her
from
some
drunken
brawl
further
up
the
street
if
perchance
she
might
hear
listened
and
held
her
breath
and
quivered
all
over
with
hope
and
fear
then
crept
back
to
her
miserable
bed
covered
her
head
with
the
ragged
quilt
and
cried
herself
into
a
few
hours
of
forgetfulness
she
is
crying
herself
to
death
about
him
mart
said
there
was
surprise
mingled
with
awe
in
her
voice
she
told
it
to
dirk
and
the
two
stood
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
looking
out
at
the
one
window
they
carefully
avoided
looking
at
each
other
they
did
not
understand
to
them
there
was
simply
relief
in
the
absence
they
had
no
trace
of
love
for
him
in
their
hearts
the
word
father
meant
nothing
to
them
but
misery
still
there
was
that
in
them
which
respected
the
mother
grief
they
tried
to
shield
her
dirk
of
his
own
thoughtfulness
brought
home
a
bit
of
tea
in
a
paper
and
bought
half
a
pint
of
milk
at
the
corner
bakery
and
mart
took
lessons
of
sallie
and
made
a
delicate
slice
of
toast
and
borrowed
sallie
one
cup
and
saucer
to
serve
the
tea
in
she
was
disappointed
that
the
mother
cried
and
could
hardly
drink
the
tea
she
was
even
almost
vexed
that
the
mother
said
with
tears
that
poor
jock
always
did
like
tea
so
and
she
had
always
thought
that
maybe
if
he
could
have
had
it
hot
and
strong
he
would
not
have
taken
to
the
mart
had
no
faith
in
this
no
belief
that
anything
in
her
father
past
life
could
have
kept
him
from
the
drink
but
she
held
herself
silent
and
let
the
tears
have
their
way
all
the
time
she
had
in
her
heart
one
great
solemn
regret
there
was
one
who
would
have
helped
her
father
would
and
could
have
saved
him
even
from
rum
what
if
she
his
daughter
had
known
the
lord
jesus
and
could
have
taken
the
miserable
father
to
him
and
had
him
transformed
mart
had
no
doubt
about
power
to
do
it
an
unanswerable
argument
had
been
given
her
no
infidel
need
try
to
assail
her
now
but
the
father
why
had
everybody
kept
silence
and
let
him
sink
away
awful
why
had
not
she
known
christ
why
had
she
not
listened
to
sallie
but
a
week
before
why
had
not
dirk
learned
the
way
and
saved
his
father
an
awful
problem
mart
life
must
henceforth
be
shadowed
by
it
meantime
what
was
roberts
to
do
for
this
soul
how
was
she
to
help
her
and
through
her
to
help
her
brother
she
in
her
elegant
home
sat
down
to
study
this
problem
life
at
east
street
was
so
far
removed
from
life
in
the
alley
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
missing
father
days
passed
and
busy
with
many
claims
of
society
she
had
made
no
movement
toward
helping
the
girl
and
knew
as
yet
no
way
to
do
it
yet
she
carried
her
on
her
heart
monday
evening
came
and
went
and
still
she
had
been
detained
from
any
effort
one
afternoon
her
thoughts
shaped
themselves
into
action
she
would
go
and
see
mart
she
would
get
dirk
to
protect
her
in
her
journey
down
the
alley
also
in
accomplishing
this
she
would
accomplish
another
thing
she
would
call
on
dirk
at
his
place
of
business
the
chief
of
the
office
was
a
christian
man
yet
she
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
knew
less
about
dirk
and
cared
much
less
for
him
than
he
did
for
his
little
dog
who
sat
in
the
window
and
barked
at
she
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
attention
ladies
were
not
often
admitted
but
a
card
bearing
the
name
mrs
evan
roberts
was
sufficient
passport
among
any
of
the
business
men
of
the
city
stone
was
more
than
ready
he
was
eager
to
serve
her
what
could
he
do
for
the
lady
whose
carriage
waited
at
the
door
while
she
came
in
person
among
the
bales
and
boxes
her
business
must
be
urgent
it
was
could
she
speak
with
colson
just
for
a
moment
she
would
not
detain
him
long
but
she
wished
to
make
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
next
day
mr
colson
the
chief
and
his
perplexed
assistant
looked
at
each
other
thoughtfully
and
shook
their
heads
there
was
no
such
person
connected
with
their
establishment
she
must
have
the
wrong
number
no
she
was
positive
he
told
me
only
three
days
ago
that
he
was
in
your
employ
he
is
on
the
third
floor
i
the
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
again
colson
repeated
stone
there
is
certainly
a
mistake
briggs
is
in
charge
on
the
third
floor
front
and
dickson
has
the
back
rooms
no
roberts
we
have
no
such
name
among
our
men
i
am
but
roberts
gently
held
her
ground
she
was
sure
she
was
not
mistaken
for
she
had
talked
with
him
about
his
work
and
the
different
men
he
was
in
briggs
department
she
felt
quite
sure
he
was
not
a
foreman
she
explained
but
quite
a
young
man
had
been
there
but
a
few
weeks
and
everett
was
the
one
who
had
interested
himself
in
securing
the
place
light
of
some
sort
began
to
dawn
on
the
perplexed
faces
of
the
gentlemen
can
she
mean
black
dirk
do
you
suppose
questioned
the
elder
looking
hard
at
his
associate
then
came
the
sweet
voice
of
the
visitor
oh
no
he
is
not
a
colored
gentleman
his
name
is
colson
derrick
that
is
the
one
said
the
gentleman
quickly
should
he
laugh
or
be
annoyed
it
took
but
a
moment
after
that
to
summon
mr
derrick
black
he
was
certainly
not
only
by
reason
of
his
naturally
dark
skin
but
because
of
the
grimy
work
whatever
it
was
which
fell
to
his
lot
his
big
apron
was
soiled
with
ink
and
oil
and
daubed
with
bits
of
dark
color
which
seemed
not
to
be
either
he
came
forward
with
his
usual
shambling
gait
and
an
additional
shade
of
sullenness
apparent
on
his
face
but
it
glowed
a
swarthy
red
when
he
recognized
the
lady
good
afternoon
colson
she
said
and
she
held
forth
her
hand
his
own
went
forward
to
meet
it
then
drew
suddenly
back
it
is
not
clean
enough
he
said
there
ink
or
something
on
but
the
lavender
kids
were
not
withdrawn
never
mind
the
ink
a
little
honest
soil
never
hurt
anybody
and
the
rough
dark
hand
was
taken
in
her
own
then
occurred
a
few
moments
chat
at
least
the
lady
chatted
with
easy
familiarity
she
referred
to
the
social
parlors
to
the
monday
evenings
to
miss
dennis
musicale
to
half
a
dozen
themes
about
which
the
bewildered
gentlemen
within
hearing
knew
nothing
could
it
be
that
the
gentle
lady
was
trying
to
give
a
lesson
as
well
as
to
talk
with
dirk
finally
she
made
an
appointment
for
the
next
afternoon
would
his
employer
be
so
kind
as
to
excuse
him
for
an
hour
if
convenient
certainly
it
would
be
convenient
to
please
evan
roberts
dirk
was
very
much
embarrassed
he
blushed
and
stammered
and
did
not
know
how
to
answer
any
of
the
kindnesses
but
there
were
two
things
during
the
interview
which
gave
roberts
more
pleasure
than
you
perhaps
are
able
to
understand
one
was
that
at
sight
of
her
he
had
suddenly
snatched
off
the
paper
cap
which
he
wore
and
the
other
that
having
set
it
again
on
his
head
as
he
turned
from
her
he
glanced
back
from
the
door
and
in
answer
to
her
bow
and
smile
lifted
the
ugly
little
cap
with
an
air
that
was
an
exact
imitation
of
young
ried
and
yet
so
well
done
that
you
would
not
have
thought
of
it
as
an
imitation
roberts
could
have
clapped
her
hands
but
she
did
not
instead
she
said
sweetly
i
am
very
glad
that
colson
is
in
the
employ
of
a
christian
gentleman
he
is
greatly
in
need
of
help
from
all
christian
sources
and
i
am
sure
there
is
that
in
him
which
will
respond
to
judicious
then
she
let
the
bewildered
man
attend
her
to
her
carriage
and
went
her
way
rejoicing
but
there
were
plans
being
laid
for
her
at
that
moment
of
which
she
knew
nothing
she
would
go
and
see
the
girl
in
a
basket
she
had
certain
things
among
them
a
bonnet
and
a
sack
that
she
knew
would
fit
the
hair
and
face
and
she
believed
would
give
mart
pleasure
if
only
she
could
contrive
a
natural
way
to
give
them
to
her
and
there
could
be
planned
ways
of
keeping
them
safe
from
the
pawnbroker
grasp
all
this
time
she
knew
nothing
of
the
fact
that
the
hand
which
had
grasped
for
years
to
furnish
the
pawnbroker
was
stilled
forever
it
had
not
once
occurred
to
dirk
to
tell
her
it
is
a
solemn
fact
that
in
this
greater
excitement
he
had
actually
forgotten
it
as
for
the
christian
employer
he
did
not
know
of
it
to
tell
he
had
not
so
much
as
known
whether
black
dirk
had
a
father
or
not
he
was
simply
a
street
rough
whom
everett
was
trying
experiments
with
and
because
there
was
an
unusual
pressure
on
the
office
and
poor
help
was
better
than
none
he
was
helping
the
experiment
however
when
dirk
went
home
from
the
office
that
night
he
remembered
that
the
father
was
gone
mart
met
him
at
the
door
a
look
of
solemn
determination
on
her
face
dirk
she
said
going
as
sure
as
you
live
she
going
she
been
bad
all
the
afternoon
sallie
says
that
mark
doctor
will
come
to
see
her
she
knows
he
will
and
mark
shall
go
for
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
home
but
i
do
mean
to
wait
for
no
doctor
i
want
to
come
knows
the
way
and
i
want
mother
to
be
told
it
right
so
there
wo
be
no
mistake
you
go
for
her
dirk
right
off
straight
there
ai
any
time
to
lose
for
i
tell
you
now
she
been
failing
all
along
you
know
and
she
has
just
cried
herself
down
dirk
will
you
go
for
as
fast
as
you
can
the
confusion
of
pronouns
might
have
bewildered
you
they
did
not
dirk
meant
to
him
exactly
what
it
did
to
mart
he
could
not
think
how
it
could
possibly
mean
any
other
person
but
this
was
astounding
news
about
his
mother
it
was
one
thing
to
have
a
father
disappear
whom
he
had
simply
feared
until
he
had
learned
to
hate
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
talk
about
the
going
away
of
the
only
one
who
had
ever
tried
to
mend
his
clothes
and
who
had
sat
up
nights
to
wash
them
when
she
could
he
strode
past
mart
into
the
wretched
room
and
looked
at
the
bed
in
the
corner
the
mother
was
asleep
but
on
her
face
was
a
strange
change
a
something
that
he
had
never
seen
there
before
worn
and
sunken
as
it
always
was
it
made
him
understand
mart
fears
i
go
he
said
huskily
and
rushed
from
the
house
carriage
was
just
rolling
down
the
avenue
as
his
swift
feet
cleared
the
alley
he
knew
the
horses
he
was
a
little
ahead
of
them
but
it
was
not
probable
that
the
driver
would
stop
for
him
wo
you
stop
that
carriage
he
said
in
breathless
haste
to
a
policeman
at
the
corner
i
got
to
speak
to
the
lady
that
in
i
be
quite
likely
to
no
doubt
said
the
policeman
in
quiet
irony
what
rascality
are
you
up
to
now
dirk
you
be
decent
for
a
few
days
but
dirk
was
trying
to
free
himself
from
the
detaining
hand
and
threw
up
one
arm
in
a
sort
of
despairing
gesture
to
the
coachman
roberts
caught
the
signal
recognized
the
face
and
in
another
moment
the
horses
stood
restlessly
by
the
and
dirk
his
embarrassment
gone
told
his
brief
story
rapidly
father
went
off
a
spell
ago
and
never
came
back
and
mother
she
is
sickly
and
it
set
her
crying
and
she
mart
thinks
and
i
guess
it
so
and
mart
wants
you
to
come
and
show
her
the
way
she
said
you
knew
how
and
you
would
chapter
xxviii
may
she
go
with
me
of
course
she
went
and
of
course
now
that
the
truth
was
known
much
was
done
everett
was
summoned
the
wretched
bed
with
its
distressing
rags
were
turned
out
together
and
a
comfortable
one
took
its
place
broths
and
teas
and
jellies
and
physical
comfort
of
every
kind
were
furnished
and
the
doctor
did
his
best
to
battle
with
the
disease
that
long
years
of
want
and
misery
had
fastened
upon
their
victim
it
was
all
too
late
of
course
it
was
true
what
roberts
sadly
said
that
half
of
the
effort
expended
years
or
even
months
before
might
have
saved
the
poor
tortured
life
but
now
how
awful
those
too
lates
are
is
it
a
wonder
that
we
ever
take
the
risk
of
having
one
ring
in
our
ears
forever
there
was
one
thing
over
which
some
of
these
christian
workers
shed
tears
of
joy
am
too
late
said
everett
but
my
master
has
as
much
power
as
ever
he
can
save
and
he
did
the
poor
tired
woman
who
years
before
had
remembered
an
old
story
well
enough
to
name
her
one
daughter
martha
in
memory
of
the
one
who
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
lazarus
roused
her
dull
heart
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
listened
while
the
wonderful
story
was
told
her
that
he
loved
not
only
martha
and
her
sister
but
her
own
poor
sinful
wrecked
self
loved
her
enough
to
reach
after
her
and
call
and
wait
and
prepare
for
her
a
home
in
his
glory
dear
why
has
not
some
one
come
with
the
news
before
surely
she
would
have
listened
during
these
long
sad
years
well
they
made
the
way
plain
neither
was
it
a
difficult
thing
to
do
the
woman
was
weary
and
and
afraid
and
longed
for
nothing
so
much
as
a
place
of
refuge
she
knew
that
she
was
a
sinner
she
knew
that
she
was
and
had
been
for
many
a
year
powerless
to
help
herself
why
should
she
not
hail
with
joy
the
story
of
a
great
and
willing
helper
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
gleam
of
eagerness
to
hear
the
words
weary
yes
indeed
heavy
laden
who
more
so
if
the
call
was
not
for
her
whom
it
mean
what
else
why
what
but
the
glorious
old
story
i
will
give
you
rest
what
wonder
that
she
closed
her
eyes
and
smiled
what
wonder
that
the
first
words
after
that
were
i
come
show
me
and
he
showed
her
how
dirk
the
sister
said
when
the
mother
had
gone
the
last
and
only
restful
journey
of
her
life
dirk
went
to
heaven
and
i
going
i
been
wanting
to
tell
you
for
more
than
a
week
but
i
did
know
how
asked
me
to
and
i
going
now
must
we
never
had
a
good
time
here
and
she
kind
of
expect
it
in
heaven
and
be
looking
out
for
you
she
always
looked
out
for
you
then
did
dirk
lose
his
and
great
tears
rolled
down
his
dark
cheeks
but
the
sister
shed
no
tears
she
had
serious
business
to
attend
to
dirk
must
go
to
heaven
now
without
fail
one
day
there
was
an
unusual
scene
in
the
alley
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
to
see
a
coffin
carried
out
from
there
but
on
this
day
there
was
a
hearse
and
a
minister
in
everett
carriage
and
dirk
and
his
sister
in
neat
apparel
came
out
together
and
were
seated
in
roberts
carriage
and
all
the
boys
of
the
class
walked
arm
in
arm
after
the
carriages
and
the
children
of
the
alley
stopped
their
placing
and
their
fighting
and
the
women
stood
silent
in
doorways
and
took
most
of
them
their
very
first
lesson
in
the
proprieties
of
life
she
got
a
ride
in
a
carriage
at
last
poor
soul
said
one
thinking
of
the
body
in
the
coffin
and
another
said
i
wonder
what
poor
old
jock
would
think
of
all
this
but
the
scene
made
its
impression
and
left
its
lesson
i
think
the
voices
of
some
of
them
were
lower
during
the
rest
of
the
day
because
of
it
what
next
it
was
the
question
that
filled
roberts
thoughts
something
must
be
done
for
dirk
and
mart
that
fearful
alley
was
no
place
for
human
beings
certainly
not
for
these
two
but
what
to
do
with
them
was
a
question
not
easily
answered
various
plans
were
proposed
sallie
calkins
two
rooms
were
much
better
than
the
cellar
in
which
the
colson
family
had
lived
and
there
was
a
chance
to
rent
a
room
next
to
sallie
with
a
closet
opening
from
it
for
dirk
how
would
it
do
to
have
them
board
with
sallie
the
suggestion
came
first
from
gracie
dennis
and
sounded
reasonable
roberts
was
almost
ashamed
to
dislike
it
as
much
as
she
did
sallie
neat
rooms
were
now
the
father
for
this
length
of
time
at
least
held
to
his
pledge
and
son
and
daughter
were
radiant
over
him
he
had
gone
to
work
and
already
the
two
rooms
were
taking
on
an
air
of
greater
comfort
because
of
the
little
things
that
he
proudly
brought
home
sallie
was
doing
her
part
wisely
the
table
was
regularly
laid
now
with
a
white
cloth
and
knives
and
forks
and
two
new
cups
and
plates
had
been
added
to
the
dishes
would
it
be
wise
to
invade
this
home
just
at
this
juncture
and
introduce
boarders
roberts
did
not
believe
that
it
would
it
was
not
as
though
the
father
had
an
established
character
and
stood
ready
to
shield
his
children
they
were
still
acting
the
protective
and
he
had
but
too
recently
risen
from
the
depths
where
dirk
and
mart
had
laughed
and
jeered
at
him
besides
the
rooms
were
located
in
that
dreadful
alley
and
do
what
she
would
roberts
could
not
feel
that
that
face
could
find
a
safe
in
that
alley
some
other
way
must
be
thought
of
their
immediate
future
was
arranged
through
the
intervention
of
a
house
agent
for
even
that
dreary
and
desolate
cellar
had
its
agent
who
was
eager
to
secure
his
rent
he
was
unwise
enough
to
undertake
to
interview
roberts
as
she
descended
from
her
carriage
not
long
after
it
had
followed
mart
mother
to
the
grave
he
considered
this
effort
of
his
a
special
stroke
of
business
energy
he
wanted
to
be
patient
with
the
poor
he
said
there
was
an
agent
in
the
city
who
waited
for
them
oftener
than
he
did
but
business
was
business
and
it
stood
to
reason
that
he
could
not
depend
on
a
fellow
like
dirk
it
had
been
bad
enough
when
the
mother
was
there
but
he
could
think
of
such
a
thing
as
risking
it
now
what
was
he
to
understand
did
she
mean
to
rent
the
room
for
them
and
for
how
long
because
it
was
his
duty
to
look
out
for
the
future
what
would
be
more
natural
than
for
roberts
with
those
two
young
things
looking
on
to
say
that
of
course
she
would
be
responsible
for
the
rent
as
long
as
they
lived
in
the
room
thus
reasoned
the
house
agent
instead
of
which
roberts
turned
toward
dirk
her
face
flushed
over
the
hardness
of
a
man
who
could
stop
a
boy
and
girl
on
such
business
on
their
way
from
their
mother
grave
and
said
if
i
were
in
your
place
colson
i
should
not
rent
these
rooms
at
all
they
are
not
suited
to
your
sister
needs
i
am
sure
you
can
do
the
agent
was
disgusted
colson
indeed
the
disreputable
young
scamp
whom
nobody
trusted
he
would
show
this
silly
woman
a
fact
or
two
business
is
business
he
repeated
doggedly
either
they
must
take
the
room
and
pay
the
rent
in
advance
or
else
they
must
hustle
out
this
very
he
had
waited
now
three
days
after
time
for
decency
sake
and
more
than
that
he
could
and
would
do
dirk
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
the
red
coming
and
going
on
his
swarthy
face
here
was
responsibility
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
the
mother
was
not
there
to
count
out
the
hoarded
rent
with
trembling
fingers
and
save
the
wretched
home
to
them
for
another
month
she
would
never
be
there
again
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
pay
rent
he
had
nowhere
to
move
yet
had
called
him
colson
and
seemed
to
expect
him
to
act
for
himself
and
mart
it
was
she
who
answered
the
agent
but
she
spoke
to
dirk
very
well
i
suppose
you
are
quite
as
willing
to
leave
here
as
at
any
time
if
i
were
you
i
would
leave
immediately
let
your
sister
come
home
with
me
for
the
night
and
until
you
have
time
to
make
other
roberts
had
been
summoned
to
a
bank
meeting
and
had
sent
ried
to
attend
his
wife
he
came
forward
now
from
the
carriage
where
he
had
stood
waiting
and
laid
a
hand
on
dirk
arm
and
you
come
home
with
me
colson
he
said
in
a
cordial
tone
such
as
he
might
have
used
with
any
young
friend
then
we
shall
have
a
chance
to
talk
things
over
and
make
that
is
nice
roberts
said
quickly
rejoicing
in
her
heart
over
ried
promptness
to
act
then
you
can
get
away
from
this
wretched
place
at
once
roberts
will
see
to
the
removal
of
your
goods
whatever
you
need
and
the
agent
can
call
on
him
in
the
morning
that
will
be
the
simplest
way
to
settle
it
all
may
she
go
with
me
a
slight
caressing
movement
of
a
gloved
hand
on
the
girl
arm
accompanied
this
question
mart
was
silent
with
bewilderment
when
had
dirk
ever
before
been
asked
what
might
do
or
might
not
do
at
first
she
was
half
inclined
to
scorn
the
suggestion
then
suddenly
it
came
to
her
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
protection
she
was
not
alone
it
was
dirk
business
to
think
of
and
care
for
her
would
he
do
it
as
for
dirk
no
wonder
that
his
face
was
deeply
flushed
new
thoughts
were
struggling
in
his
heart
was
to
decide
for
mart
he
was
the
head
of
the
home
now
roberts
waited
anxiously
she
longed
exceedingly
to
rouse
in
the
boy
who
was
already
grown
to
the
stature
of
a
man
a
sense
of
responsibility
a
moment
more
and
he
had
shaken
himself
free
from
the
spell
which
seemed
to
bind
him
we
do
as
you
he
spoke
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
assumed
his
proper
place
and
taken
up
his
duties
mart
you
go
along
with
her
and
i
see
about
things
and
mart
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
received
and
obeyed
in
silence
a
direction
from
her
brother
possibly
roberts
may
have
been
mistaken
but
she
thought
that
much
had
been
accomplished
that
day
yet
none
of
them
realized
whereunto
this
thing
would
grow
roberts
when
she
ushered
mart
that
evening
into
the
pink
room
again
and
showed
her
how
to
manage
the
hot
and
cold
water
and
which
bell
to
ring
if
she
needed
anything
and
in
every
imaginable
way
treated
her
as
a
guest
whom
it
was
pleasant
to
serve
had
really
no
plans
just
then
no
hobby
to
ride
but
simply
acted
out
the
dictates
of
her
heart
you
will
remember
that
her
christian
life
had
been
always
unconventional
the
very
fact
that
during
her
early
girlhood
she
had
been
painfully
trammelled
by
what
they
would
say
or
think
seemed
to
have
had
its
influence
over
her
later
experiences
since
she
had
been
made
free
she
would
be
free
indeed
that
is
with
the
liberty
with
which
christ
makes
us
free
what
would
please
she
resolved
should
be
the
one
thought
to
which
she
would
give
careful
attention
now
it
is
perhaps
worthy
of
mention
that
this
closely
following
disciple
did
not
once
stop
to
determine
whether
it
would
please
him
to
give
such
tender
care
to
this
stray
child
of
his
or
whether
she
would
be
considered
doing
not
just
the
thing
in
eyes
if
she
entertained
her
in
the
pink
room
about
what
he
could
have
her
do
next
she
gave
much
thought
and
it
was
not
for
days
or
rather
weeks
that
she
caught
the
possibility
of
his
meaning
that
the
pink
room
should
really
be
the
girl
own
it
was
just
this
way
the
weeks
went
by
and
no
plan
for
settling
mart
comfortably
elsewhere
met
roberts
approval
there
was
constantly
some
excellent
reason
why
the
one
mentioned
would
not
do
meantime
they
became
she
and
gracie
dennis
more
and
more
deeply
interested
in
mart
in
her
wardrobe
first
wherever
she
lives
she
should
have
respectable
clothing
thus
much
is
easily
so
the
matron
decreed
and
gracie
did
not
gainsay
it
she
became
absorbed
in
preparing
it
such
fascinating
work
so
many
things
were
needed
and
her
skin
was
so
delicate
and
her
eyes
so
blue
and
gracie
choice
of
shades
and
textures
fitted
her
so
precisely
then
when
dressed
simple
though
her
toilet
was
her
remarkable
beauty
shone
out
so
conspicuously
as
to
alarm
roberts
whenever
she
thought
of
her
in
shop
or
store
several
times
during
the
weeks
she
visited
sallie
calkins
and
looked
about
her
with
a
thoughtful
air
and
came
away
feeling
that
it
would
not
do
there
was
mark
growing
into
manhood
a
good
boy
respectable
proud
of
his
good
homely
sister
and
of
his
reformed
father
the
two
rooms
were
taking
on
every
sort
of
homely
comfort
that
sallie
skill
helped
by
roberts
suggestions
could
devise
it
was
growing
into
a
model
little
home
in
its
way
but
there
was
not
a
corner
in
it
where
mart
would
fit
then
as
the
days
passed
a
subtle
fascinating
change
began
to
come
over
mart
she
slipped
quietly
into
certain
household
duties
she
showed
marvellous
skill
with
her
needle
such
skill
indeed
that
gracie
dennis
said
more
than
once
i
tell
you
flossy
what
to
do
with
her
put
her
in
a
good
establishment
and
let
her
learn
the
dressmaking
trade
she
could
make
her
fortune
in
and
roberts
smiled
and
assented
to
the
statement
but
not
to
the
proposition
there
was
no
dressmaking
establishment
known
to
her
where
she
was
willing
to
place
so
young
and
pretty
and
ignorant
a
girl
but
she
was
quite
willing
that
mart
should
learn
the
looping
of
dresses
and
the
fitting
of
sacks
and
collars
and
ruffles
and
take
many
a
stitch
for
her
as
well
as
for
gracie
she
was
willing
to
have
her
do
a
dozen
little
nameless
things
the
ways
of
doing
which
she
had
caught
up
until
at
last
the
touch
of
her
fingers
began
to
be
felt
about
the
rooms
and
roberts
began
to
notice
that
she
should
miss
mart
when
she
went
away
still
from
the
first
time
she
said
this
the
thought
came
afterward
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
and
it
was
but
a
week
afterward
that
she
caught
herself
phrasing
it
that
she
should
miss
her
she
went
away
what
about
dirk
young
ried
could
have
told
you
more
of
him
during
these
days
than
anybody
else
he
still
stayed
at
the
saunders
the
mistress
of
it
was
one
whom
if
you
had
known
her
you
would
feel
sure
could
interest
herself
heartily
in
such
as
he
there
was
a
bit
of
a
room
next
to
ried
to
be
sure
it
had
been
used
for
a
and
it
took
the
busy
housekeeper
half
a
day
to
plan
how
she
could
get
along
without
it
but
she
planned
and
offered
it
to
ried
for
his
just
for
the
present
you
know
until
he
sees
what
he
can
do
poor
fellow
she
said
and
ried
accepted
the
little
room
joyfully
and
helped
fit
it
up
chapter
xxix
what
if
i
belonged
you
think
things
are
taking
very
rapid
strides
well
do
you
know
that
there
come
periods
when
they
do
just
that
thing
or
appear
to
why
even
the
buds
on
the
trees
teach
us
the
lesson
how
many
springtimes
have
you
gone
to
your
bed
feeling
that
the
season
was
late
and
the
trees
were
bare
and
the
fruits
would
all
be
backward
and
nature
was
dawdling
along
in
a
very
wearisome
fashion
and
awakened
in
the
morning
to
find
that
there
had
in
the
night
been
a
gentle
rain
and
a
movement
of
mysterious
power
among
the
buds
and
the
grasses
and
that
now
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
world
had
burst
into
bloom
yet
did
you
really
suppose
after
all
that
the
was
done
in
one
night
there
was
progress
of
several
sorts
in
the
class
at
the
south
end
even
a
casual
observer
could
have
seen
a
change
in
the
boys
that
first
sunday
after
they
had
attended
dirk
mother
to
the
grave
the
dignity
of
that
hour
of
sorrow
was
still
upon
them
even
the
very
reckless
and
will
offer
a
certain
degree
of
respect
to
death
on
ordinary
occasions
the
boys
might
have
been
merry
at
dirk
expense
for
they
saw
changes
in
him
but
the
memory
of
his
mother
coffin
kept
them
silent
and
let
his
changed
manner
have
its
effect
that
sunday
was
full
of
small
events
to
dirk
at
least
they
are
small
enough
when
one
puts
them
on
paper
though
i
admit
that
they
looked
large
to
him
several
people
interested
themselves
in
his
welfare
poor
fellow
said
saunders
i
suppose
his
mother
tried
to
do
for
him
just
as
likely
as
not
she
had
a
clean
shirt
for
him
of
a
sunday
you
will
perceive
that
saunders
though
all
her
life
a
resident
of
a
large
city
was
not
very
with
the
abject
poor
in
point
of
fact
dirk
colson
had
had
no
extra
clothing
for
his
mother
to
make
clean
but
saunders
full
of
the
motherly
thought
yet
finding
no
trace
of
a
shirt
in
the
bundle
of
rags
that
dirk
had
brought
with
him
went
down
one
day
into
the
depths
of
an
old
trunk
and
brought
to
light
and
mended
and
washed
and
ironed
a
shirt
that
had
long
been
laid
aside
it
lay
in
its
purity
on
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
dirk
bed
on
sabbath
morning
he
lay
still
and
looked
at
it
for
a
while
then
arose
and
gave
such
careful
attention
to
the
soap
and
water
as
was
new
to
him
and
arrayed
himself
in
the
clean
linen
his
clothes
were
whole
and
clean
roberts
had
seen
to
it
that
he
went
respectably
dressed
to
his
mother
funeral
a
tap
at
his
door
a
little
later
and
young
ried
appeared
and
in
hand
want
to
borrow
he
said
in
the
careless
tone
of
one
who
might
have
supposed
that
the
blacking
of
his
boots
was
an
matter
to
this
boy
i
always
keep
my
own
it
is
cheaper
than
to
depend
on
the
street
dirk
said
nothing
at
all
but
reached
forth
his
hand
and
took
the
offered
tools
and
the
hint
which
came
with
them
when
he
went
down
to
breakfast
his
boots
shone
and
his
fresh
paper
collar
was
neatly
arranged
altogether
he
was
not
the
boy
to
whom
i
first
introduced
you
i
am
not
sure
that
policeman
duffer
would
have
recognized
him
a
collar
and
a
necktie
make
a
great
difference
in
some
people
personal
appearance
dirk
wondered
a
little
as
to
where
the
box
of
paper
collars
came
from
the
necktie
he
had
just
found
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
it
was
the
mate
of
the
one
young
ried
wore
but
that
told
nothing
for
both
were
simple
and
plain
and
could
be
bought
by
the
dozens
in
any
furnishing
store
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
boys
in
the
class
looked
at
him
nimble
dick
wore
at
first
a
roguish
air
but
a
sudden
memory
of
dirk
face
when
he
turned
away
from
his
mother
grave
came
in
time
open
graves
are
not
easy
things
to
forget
dirk
went
to
the
church
that
day
went
with
young
ried
by
invitation
and
sat
in
the
pew
behind
roberts
by
the
way
the
seat
which
he
occupied
was
another
of
peculiarities
three
seats
were
rented
by
him
in
a
central
part
of
the
large
church
one
of
these
seats
he
and
his
wife
regularly
occupied
the
others
were
almost
as
regularly
occupied
by
the
clerks
from
the
store
who
chose
to
make
that
their
church
home
six
sittings
to
a
pew
when
a
young
man
chose
roberts
was
ready
to
enter
into
a
business
engagement
with
him
whereby
the
sitting
should
be
considered
his
own
roberts
considering
it
to
be
no
part
of
any
one
concern
that
the
sum
for
which
he
thus
the
sittings
was
not
a
tenth
of
what
the
first
rental
cost
it
was
in
this
way
that
ried
owned
sittings
in
the
pew
just
back
of
that
occupied
by
roberts
and
brought
with
him
constantly
one
and
another
young
man
today
the
young
man
was
dirk
colson
it
was
all
a
strange
world
to
him
he
had
wandered
into
the
gallery
of
the
mission
chapel
and
looked
down
from
his
perch
on
the
crowd
of
worshippers
but
this
morning
he
was
in
the
very
centre
of
things
as
if
he
were
one
of
them
perhaps
it
is
not
strange
that
the
startled
inquiry
came
to
his
heart
what
if
i
belonged
where
did
he
belong
now
he
had
lost
his
place
he
must
make
another
what
if
it
should
be
in
this
neighborhood
among
these
surroundings
such
thoughts
did
not
take
actual
shape
to
him
so
that
he
could
have
put
them
into
words
they
merely
hovered
in
his
atmosphere
roberts
sat
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
which
thing
he
liked
to
do
it
had
long
since
been
settled
in
his
mind
that
he
had
one
friend
and
that
one
was
roberts
he
admired
gracie
dennis
too
with
a
different
sort
of
admiration
from
that
which
he
gave
to
the
matron
she
might
be
all
very
well
and
she
was
a
splendid
reader
and
he
knew
that
he
could
imitate
her
on
certain
sentences
at
least
and
she
had
taught
him
to
use
the
an
accomplishment
which
he
meant
to
perfect
himself
in
as
soon
as
he
had
a
chance
in
fact
his
ambition
reached
higher
than
that
one
of
these
days
he
meant
to
make
one
of
his
own
with
certain
improvements
who
shall
say
that
dirk
was
not
growing
on
this
particular
day
there
sat
beside
roberts
a
lady
a
stranger
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
for
some
reason
which
he
did
not
understand
dirk
liked
to
look
at
her
she
suggested
something
to
him
that
seemed
like
a
familiar
dream
he
thought
much
about
her
and
resolved
to
see
if
in
her
face
she
looked
like
any
one
he
ever
saw
as
she
turned
at
the
close
of
the
service
he
was
looking
at
her
steadily
lo
it
was
mart
now
the
possibility
had
not
once
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
if
you
think
this
doubtful
you
merely
show
that
you
know
nothing
about
the
transforming
effect
of
a
becoming
dress
no
matter
how
simple
it
may
be
remember
dirk
had
never
but
twice
seen
his
sister
in
a
bonnet
the
first
time
it
was
sallie
and
though
the
effect
was
sufficiently
startling
yet
sallie
bonnet
did
not
fit
her
face
as
this
creation
of
gracie
dennis
fingers
did
the
second
time
the
bonnet
had
been
a
hideous
black
one
proffered
by
an
old
woman
who
lived
in
the
story
above
them
and
whose
thoughtfulness
roberts
would
not
mar
by
making
any
mention
of
the
neat
one
which
she
had
brought
in
a
box
that
day
the
black
bonnet
had
been
like
a
mask
hiding
mart
beauty
the
bonnet
that
she
wore
now
was
not
of
that
character
it
told
a
wonderful
story
to
dirk
astonished
gaze
now
indeed
the
likeness
was
plain
without
doubt
the
girl
whose
face
lighted
with
a
curious
smile
at
sight
of
him
bore
a
striking
likeness
to
the
woman
who
had
smiled
at
him
whenever
she
met
him
a
curious
effect
this
had
on
dirk
there
was
that
in
his
sister
which
made
it
possible
for
her
to
be
something
like
the
woman
who
had
won
his
heart
and
that
sister
was
in
his
care
she
had
said
so
he
must
work
for
her
and
watch
over
her
i
suppose
that
sabbath
was
really
the
beginning
of
the
surface
changes
in
roberts
class
not
the
beginning
to
the
teacher
but
to
those
people
who
only
have
eyes
for
strongly
marked
things
i
know
that
it
was
but
a
few
weeks
afterward
that
roberts
came
home
with
such
an
unusual
light
in
her
eyes
and
with
her
face
so
full
of
brightness
that
her
husband
said
inquiringly
what
is
it
flossy
she
turned
to
him
eagerly
ready
to
laugh
it
is
what
you
will
understand
but
a
great
many
people
would
it
is
so
nice
that
you
understand
things
i
feel
just
like
saying
the
lord
do
you
mean
to
convey
the
idea
that
only
a
very
few
favored
people
feel
like
that
i
do
know
of
a
person
who
has
not
great
occasion
what
is
your
special
one
evan
the
last
boy
had
his
boots
blacked
and
a
fresh
paper
collar
on
roberts
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
a
genial
hearty
laugh
his
wife
looked
on
smiling
there
is
a
great
deal
of
character
in
a
laugh
remember
you
would
have
known
that
this
was
a
sympathetic
one
roberts
was
entirely
capable
of
realizing
what
this
said
to
his
wife
about
the
future
of
her
boys
it
was
becoming
certain
that
their
was
awakened
a
few
days
thereafter
occurred
another
of
those
little
things
which
mark
some
characters
dirk
at
saunders
on
sabbath
morning
heard
talk
that
on
monday
he
recalled
by
the
way
i
should
have
told
you
of
one
other
way
in
which
the
sabbath
became
a
marked
day
to
him
he
slept
in
the
little
room
which
opened
from
ried
but
his
meals
were
picked
up
at
a
restaurant
as
occasion
offered
a
much
nicer
and
surer
method
of
living
than
he
had
ever
known
before
even
the
commonest
restaurant
had
great
respectability
to
him
yet
you
will
remember
that
he
had
by
this
time
taken
several
suppers
in
roberts
he
knew
that
there
was
a
difference
in
things
in
fact
his
experience
now
stretched
over
infinite
differences
but
the
first
time
he
sat
down
to
saunders
on
a
sabbath
morning
he
discovered
another
grade
this
by
no
means
belonged
to
the
restaurant
class
the
sunday
breakfasts
and
dinners
were
some
of
saunders
quiet
ways
of
helping
along
the
work
of
the
christian
world
many
a
young
man
appeared
at
her
table
as
the
guest
of
ried
or
of
everett
or
of
some
other
of
the
boarders
who
was
unaware
that
he
owed
the
pleasant
experience
to
the
landlady
well
dirk
at
the
heard
talk
of
one
general
burton
famous
as
a
soldier
a
scholar
and
an
orator
general
burton
was
in
the
city
the
guest
of
a
prominent
man
he
was
to
speak
on
the
following
evening
in
one
of
the
great
halls
and
much
eager
talk
was
had
concerning
him
great
desire
was
expressed
to
hear
him
to
get
a
glimpse
of
him
dirk
listened
in
silence
but
had
his
own
thoughts
about
what
it
must
be
to
have
people
talking
about
one
wanting
to
get
a
glimpse
of
one
and
next
what
it
must
be
to
be
intimate
with
such
people
did
roberts
know
the
great
man
he
wondered
and
then
dirk
smiled
as
he
thought
how
queer
it
was
that
he
should
know
roberts
that
he
might
in
fact
be
called
intimately
acquainted
with
her
remembering
this
reverie
of
his
you
will
better
understand
how
he
felt
on
monday
morning
as
he
made
his
way
in
haste
down
a
quiet
part
of
one
of
the
streets
intent
on
an
errand
that
required
promptness
to
hear
his
name
called
by
roberts
good
morning
she
said
are
you
in
too
great
haste
to
recognize
your
friends
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
a
friend
of
mine
general
burton
colson
general
this
is
one
of
my
young
men
of
whom
i
told
whereupon
the
famous
general
hero
of
many
battles
held
out
his
honored
hand
and
took
dirk
in
a
cordial
grasp
i
do
suppose
i
could
explain
to
you
what
an
effect
this
action
had
on
a
boy
like
dirk
there
is
this
comfort
you
may
be
a
student
of
human
nature
and
therefore
may
understand
it
all
without
explanation
this
is
only
one
of
many
trifles
which
occurred
during
the
weeks
to
make
their
indelible
impress
on
the
characters
of
the
boys
of
course
the
monday
evenings
prospered
and
and
as
time
passed
lessons
of
all
sorts
made
good
progress
boots
hair
and
fresh
collars
became
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
other
avenues
for
improvement
opened
it
became
noised
abroad
in
christian
circles
that
great
transformations
were
being
worked
among
a
certain
set
of
hard
young
fellows
who
had
hitherto
been
best
known
to
the
police
roberts
was
interviewed
by
one
and
another
and
one
outgrowth
of
the
talks
was
that
tickets
for
a
course
of
expensive
and
valuable
and
attractive
lectures
on
popular
subjects
were
placed
in
large
numbers
in
roberts
hands
for
him
to
use
at
discretion
moreover
seats
were
rented
in
the
church
towards
which
most
of
the
boys
gravitated
the
one
connected
with
their
mission
seats
after
roberts
plan
so
that
as
often
as
there
appeared
a
young
man
who
cared
to
have
a
spot
in
the
church
which
belonged
to
him
it
could
be
had
for
a
very
small
sum
in
fact
as
pews
rented
in
that
church
a
ridiculously
small
sum
these
are
only
hints
of
the
channels
which
time
and
patience
and
thought
opened
for
these
young
men
on
whom
but
a
short
time
before
satan
believed
himself
to
have
so
firm
a
grip
one
feature
of
the
monday
evenings
had
in
the
course
of
time
to
be
changed
the
young
teacher
of
elocution
went
home
i
want
to
go
she
said
at
last
in
answer
to
her
hostess
pleading
i
think
it
quite
likely
that
papa
would
let
me
stay
and
attend
school
here
but
i
am
in
haste
to
get
home
you
need
not
look
sober
flossy
i
have
had
a
happier
time
than
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
before
and
i
have
found
here
a
sort
of
happiness
that
will
last
it
almost
breaks
my
heart
to
think
of
leaving
those
boys
especially
my
dear
dick
bolton
but
really
i
need
to
go
home
and
undo
certain
things
that
i
left
badly
done
you
do
half
know
me
flossy
shipley
when
i
came
here
i
was
a
regular
goose
if
you
had
known
what
a
simpleton
i
was
and
how
hateful
i
had
been
about
some
things
at
home
you
would
never
have
invited
me
among
other
things
that
were
hateful
about
me
i
was
a
real
horror
to
my
mother
i
thought
i
had
reason
to
distrust
and
dislike
her
when
the
truth
is
that
i
have
cause
to
go
down
on
my
knees
and
thank
her
for
keeping
me
from
some
things
i
in
a
real
hurry
to
get
home
and
show
that
young
mother
of
mine
what
a
perfectly
angelic
daughter
i
can
and
roberts
smiled
and
kept
her
own
counsel
and
this
was
all
that
she
was
supposed
to
know
about
her
young
guest
she
never
knew
the
whole
story
about
professor
ellis
though
there
was
a
girl
hester
mason
by
name
in
everett
who
could
have
told
her
a
good
deal
about
him
and
about
gracie
dennis
helping
to
break
the
net
that
satan
had
woven
for
her
unwary
feet
the
fact
is
there
is
a
great
deal
concerning
all
these
people
hester
mason
and
everett
and
joy
saunders
and
joy
saunders
mother
which
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
you
if
i
could
have
found
room
you
may
read
of
them
any
time
however
if
you
choose
in
a
book
called
an
endless
of
course
the
story
of
their
lives
does
not
end
even
because
the
chain
is
as
i
said
but
there
are
many
of
the
links
presented
to
view
so
grace
dennis
went
home
and
neither
then
nor
afterward
did
roberts
hear
in
detail
the
story
of
professor
ellis
what
matter
she
had
however
a
short
added
chapter
it
came
in
a
letter
from
marion
dennis
not
long
after
gracie
return
it
read
oh
flossy
shipley
roberts
blessed
little
scheming
saint
that
you
are
what
did
you
do
how
did
you
do
it
ah
i
know
more
about
it
than
those
sentences
would
indicate
the
dear
lord
did
it
working
through
you
his
servant
he
has
called
our
gracie
to
higher
ground
filled
her
heart
with
that
which
has
made
insignificant
things
take
their
true
place
and
wrong
things
show
for
what
they
are
you
know
of
course
that
it
is
all
right
about
professor
ellis
or
no
i
fear
it
is
all
wrong
about
him
but
right
with
our
gracie
i
hear
that
he
has
permanently
located
in
your
city
perhaps
your
christian
charity
can
reach
him
he
sent
gracie
a
letter
trying
to
explain
certain
affairs
about
that
mason
girl
with
which
i
presume
you
are
familiar
she
showed
me
the
letter
and
her
answer
he
will
not
write
her
another
do
know
any
mason
girl
said
roberts
to
her
husband
but
it
does
matter
i
do
want
to
know
the
story
if
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
through
it
there
are
stories
enough
that
one
chapter
xxx
it
is
no
affair
it
was
monday
evening
and
there
was
company
at
roberts
home
not
the
usual
monday
evening
gathering
but
quite
a
large
party
of
men
and
women
many
of
them
young
yet
some
were
the
pretty
room
opposite
the
conservatory
was
thrown
open
and
aglow
with
lights
and
flowers
and
groups
were
continually
passing
in
and
out
admiring
the
paintings
and
the
flowers
and
the
of
different
patterns
and
the
books
and
magazines
of
which
there
were
many
but
interest
was
not
confined
to
this
room
the
parlors
were
thrown
open
and
the
beyond
even
the
cosy
little
library
was
public
property
for
this
one
evening
the
company
was
large
and
their
tastes
were
varied
so
no
pains
had
been
spared
to
give
them
variety
you
are
acquainted
with
quite
a
number
of
the
guests
yet
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
you
would
recognize
them
all
even
in
so
short
a
period
of
time
as
three
years
great
changes
may
be
elicited
for
instance
do
you
know
the
young
man
in
unnoticeable
and
therefore
appropriate
evening
dress
who
is
doing
duty
at
the
piano
watching
with
practiced
eye
the
course
of
the
player
and
turning
the
leaf
with
skilful
hand
at
just
the
right
moment
it
is
a
somewhat
embarrassing
position
but
his
manner
leads
you
to
suppose
that
he
has
been
accustomed
to
it
all
his
life
and
that
he
reads
music
well
in
the
latter
belief
you
are
correct
but
as
to
being
accustomed
to
it
three
years
ago
nimble
dick
could
have
told
you
a
different
story
you
ca
believe
that
it
is
he
i
do
not
wonder
the
change
is
certainly
a
great
one
but
he
does
not
feel
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
almost
forgets
when
he
becomes
absorbed
in
his
work
that
this
sort
of
society
was
not
always
open
to
him
three
years
means
a
long
time
to
the
young
and
richard
bolton
has
so
long
been
accustomed
to
the
freedom
of
roberts
parlors
and
to
the
sort
of
people
whom
one
finds
there
that
none
of
the
refinements
of
polite
life
are
strange
to
him
and
as
to
turning
music
has
he
not
done
it
for
his
hostess
numberless
times
if
your
eyes
are
now
opened
it
is
possible
that
you
may
be
trying
to
spy
out
other
young
men
the
rooms
are
full
of
them
fashionable
young
men
but
a
few
are
noticeable
by
the
air
which
they
have
of
being
in
a
sense
responsible
for
the
comfort
of
the
others
they
are
on
the
alert
they
are
taking
care
that
no
young
guest
shall
appear
for
a
moment
to
be
forgotten
or
neglected
they
appear
to
be
entirely
familiar
with
the
house
and
all
its
appointments
they
can
be
appealed
to
for
a
glass
of
water
or
an
ice
or
to
know
what
special
scene
this
landscape
hanging
over
the
mantel
represents
or
whose
bust
this
is
in
the
niche
at
the
left
or
in
what
portion
of
the
library
a
certain
book
will
be
found
or
from
what
part
of
the
foreign
world
that
shell
came
and
they
are
all
equally
at
home
in
short
it
is
like
having
a
dozen
or
twenty
young
hosts
to
look
after
your
comfort
and
pleasure
in
point
of
fact
there
are
seventeen
of
them
the
original
seven
has
thus
increased
two
months
ago
there
were
twenty
but
one
has
secured
an
appointment
as
telegraph
operator
in
a
distant
city
and
as
stephen
crowley
occupies
a
similar
position
in
one
of
the
offices
in
this
city
some
very
interesting
conversations
are
held
and
many
important
items
connected
with
the
monday
evenings
and
the
south
end
school
and
the
library
association
are
transmitted
when
the
lines
are
not
otherwise
employed
young
haskell
too
has
gone
with
one
of
the
partners
from
the
store
where
he
was
first
employed
to
set
up
a
branch
store
in
a
not
distant
town
and
his
old
teacher
has
already
received
letters
from
him
saying
that
they
have
started
a
branch
in
the
south
part
of
the
town
and
that
he
has
picked
seven
little
wretches
out
of
the
streets
from
eight
to
twelve
years
of
age
and
gone
to
work
and
dear
roberts
i
wish
you
would
pray
for
me
that
i
may
be
able
to
bring
every
one
of
them
to
so
the
letter
ran
and
that
tells
volumes
to
the
initiated
about
young
haskell
but
although
the
changes
among
these
young
men
have
been
great
almost
to
bewilderment
only
one
of
the
number
has
been
promoted
to
a
dazzling
height
the
others
are
without
exception
earning
good
honest
livings
for
themselves
securing
good
substantial
educations
through
the
evening
classes
which
have
grown
out
of
that
first
effort
bidding
fair
to
become
leading
and
honored
citizens
when
they
actually
take
their
places
as
men
but
mark
calkins
faithful
plodding
patient
mark
has
surpassed
them
all
the
truth
is
that
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
neither
hath
entered
into
the
heart
what
sort
of
magnificence
surrounds
him
now
he
has
gone
to
court
the
chief
ruler
of
the
realm
has
sent
for
mark
to
be
always
in
his
immediate
presence
in
the
palace
and
with
what
joy
he
went
i
can
not
tell
you
nor
how
often
they
speak
of
him
and
try
to
let
their
hearts
conceive
of
the
glory
which
surrounds
him
and
dwell
on
the
day
when
they
will
be
called
one
after
another
to
share
the
same
glory
for
this
is
the
ambition
of
more
than
half
of
them
now
in
that
sentence
is
unveiled
the
most
curious
part
of
my
curious
story
and
that
it
is
curious
i
frankly
admit
it
is
no
affair
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
strangeness
of
it
you
are
to
remember
that
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
and
then
to
understand
that
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
it
is
then
a
fact
that
these
young
men
have
each
received
conditional
appointments
to
serve
in
the
palace
high
in
power
and
splendor
and
dignity
the
conditions
are
that
they
are
to
be
willing
to
be
guided
in
all
things
by
the
will
of
their
king
whom
they
each
admit
to
be
wise
above
all
wisdom
and
to
be
kind
above
all
their
conceptions
of
kindness
it
is
true
that
nine
of
the
number
have
accepted
their
appointments
donned
their
uniform
assumed
their
positions
as
he
has
directed
and
are
waiting
for
the
summons
to
appear
in
person
at
court
it
is
also
true
that
the
others
are
still
in
a
state
of
indecision
they
do
not
know
whether
to
accept
the
appointment
or
not
it
is
true
that
they
feel
themselves
honored
that
they
believe
this
to
be
the
only
path
of
honorable
and
safe
promotion
it
is
true
that
they
have
full
faith
in
those
who
will
tell
with
joy
that
having
enlisted
they
find
the
service
even
in
this
sweet
and
the
rewards
great
it
is
true
that
they
severally
visited
mark
just
as
the
door
was
opening
to
admit
him
to
the
palace
and
heard
him
speak
of
the
glimpses
of
its
glory
and
heard
that
his
last
words
before
he
went
away
were
oh
mine
eyes
see
the
king
in
his
beauty
and
that
his
voice
was
jubilant
as
that
of
a
conqueror
and
his
face
radiant
as
with
a
reflection
of
unseen
glory
and
yet
they
hesitate
and
dally
with
the
call
and
mean
some
time
to
have
such
an
inheritance
deeded
to
them
but
not
now
remember
i
am
not
responsible
for
this
were
i
writing
fiction
i
should
hesitate
to
set
down
such
idiotic
folly
expecting
you
to
call
it
unnatural
or
absurdly
overdrawn
but
i
do
solemnly
declare
to
you
that
this
is
fact
account
for
the
folly
of
their
behavior
as
best
you
can
well
sallie
and
her
father
are
left
behind
but
mind
you
they
are
not
among
the
doubtful
ones
they
both
as
much
expect
to
serve
at
court
as
they
expect
to
live
through
all
eternity
but
while
they
wait
they
are
busy
they
have
moved
from
the
alley
the
surroundings
were
not
such
as
they
liked
did
you
notice
that
bit
of
a
house
landing
modestly
back
from
the
road
at
the
further
corner
of
those
ample
grounds
that
surround
the
south
end
church
it
is
the
sexton
house
and
that
church
and
those
rooms
and
those
grounds
and
everything
pertaining
to
them
are
under
his
care
the
father
is
the
sexton
it
is
true
and
attends
the
furnace
and
rings
the
bell
but
it
is
care
that
keeps
seat
and
desk
and
window
so
beautifully
free
from
dust
or
stain
oh
they
live
busy
lives
and
happy
ones
sallie
trusted
not
in
vain
in
her
father
promise
that
night
when
he
put
his
weak
will
into
the
pledge
but
you
are
to
understand
that
it
was
but
a
few
days
thereafter
when
he
planted
his
weak
and
wavering
feet
on
the
rock
of
ages
then
did
satan
angle
for
him
in
vain
so
on
this
monday
evening
there
were
but
seventeen
at
the
gathering
i
hesitate
over
what
to
name
the
gathering
i
would
call
it
a
party
but
that
in
many
respects
it
was
so
totally
different
from
anything
with
which
you
are
probably
acquainted
by
that
name
the
young
man
who
stands
by
the
door
of
the
conservatory
eagerly
describing
to
miss
henderson
a
rare
and
curious
flower
which
has
been
sent
to
roberts
from
california
is
black
really
i
hope
you
are
sufficiently
astonished
for
he
looks
so
utterly
unlike
the
scamp
who
used
to
be
the
special
torment
of
the
south
end
mission
that
i
should
be
disappointed
if
you
were
not
impressed
by
it
mr
colson
almost
everybody
calls
him
now
the
name
has
long
since
lost
its
strangeness
he
is
in
the
employ
of
the
great
firm
of
bostwick
smythe
roberts
and
although
roberts
has
never
found
it
convenient
to
do
so
before
there
were
reasons
why
he
thought
it
would
be
well
to
have
a
clerk
within
call
so
colson
boards
with
what
was
the
junior
partner
of
the
firm
he
is
so
no
more
by
the
way
for
ried
has
been
received
as
a
member
and
is
decidedly
a
junior
partner
probably
roberts
could
tell
you
if
he
chose
why
one
so
young
and
without
capital
had
been
elected
to
partnership
but
as
a
rule
he
keeps
his
own
counsel
only
remarking
that
the
young
man
developed
remarkable
business
faculties
which
were
patent
to
the
whole
firm
to
his
wife
he
said
i
tell
you
flossy
i
believe
a
consecrated
life
will
be
honored
by
the
lord
in
whatever
channel
he
gives
it
talents
to
develop
he
doth
shall
prosper
that
young
man
is
going
to
have
a
career
in
business
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
master
meant
him
to
show
the
world
how
a
christian
can
use
money
to
his
it
is
early
yet
to
prophesy
what
colson
will
do
doubtless
he
will
be
a
merchant
certainly
he
will
be
a
christian
possibly
he
will
be
an
orator
of
whom
the
world
will
yet
hear
a
temperance
orator
for
instance
i
know
you
would
like
to
hear
him
read
a
poem
he
is
not
confined
to
will
carleton
style
now
though
he
still
reads
with
power
some
of
those
inimitable
delineations
of
life
but
gracie
dennis
offers
no
more
criticisms
when
he
reads
in
fact
i
have
heard
her
defer
to
him
when
a
question
arose
as
one
who
had
probably
studied
the
passage
and
caught
its
best
i
am
willing
to
confess
that
my
poor
black
dirk
was
a
bit
of
a
genius
the
thought
i
desire
you
to
catch
is
that
so
many
of
those
poor
fellows
who
of
necessity
live
by
their
wits
in
the
city
slums
are
diamonds
which
could
be
fitted
to
shine
you
take
a
diamond
and
throw
it
down
in
the
dirt
and
filth
and
put
your
foot
on
it
and
grind
it
in
and
leave
it
there
sinking
and
soiling
day
after
day
year
after
year
and
when
somebody
comes
along
and
picks
it
out
how
much
will
it
gleam
for
him
at
first
yet
the
diamond
is
there
thou
shalt
be
a
royal
diadem
in
the
hand
of
thy
roberts
had
been
at
work
hunting
diamonds
for
his
diadem
as
colson
stood
there
chatting
freely
with
miss
henderson
there
was
nothing
about
the
association
that
looked
incongruous
neither
did
it
occur
to
any
there
was
not
a
trace
of
embarrassment
about
this
boy
from
the
slums
he
had
forgotten
the
slums
and
stood
talking
with
one
of
the
aristocrats
of
the
city
how
came
she
to
talk
with
him
to
allow
herself
to
be
entertained
by
him
let
me
tell
you
thereby
hangs
a
tale
some
time
before
this
evening
in
fact
nearly
two
years
before
roberts
had
come
to
a
puzzle
and
stood
and
looked
at
it
doubtfully
then
she
presented
it
to
the
others
they
are
growing
easy
in
their
manners
with
me
learning
to
be
gentlemanly
without
embarrassment
and
thoughtful
over
little
things
without
being
ashamed
of
it
but
i
am
afraid
that
with
other
ladies
they
would
be
sadly
frightened
and
awkward
when
delaney
came
in
this
evening
i
could
but
notice
how
utterly
silent
colton
became
he
had
been
talking
well
before
it
seems
as
though
there
was
a
great
gulf
between
them
and
social
advancement
how
can
we
bridge
it
then
young
ried
ventured
his
thought
my
sister
ester
had
a
class
in
the
center
street
nice
little
girls
who
wore
pretty
dresses
and
had
their
hair
curled
and
came
from
the
best
families
after
she
was
taken
sick
she
told
me
one
of
her
regrets
was
that
she
had
not
stayed
well
long
enough
to
try
a
plan
which
she
had
she
meant
to
take
a
class
of
rough
little
boys
in
the
and
she
meant
to
ask
the
mothers
of
the
little
girls
to
let
them
come
once
a
month
and
play
with
the
little
boys
from
the
streets
she
to
play
with
them
and
watch
over
them
every
moment
but
to
try
to
interest
the
girls
in
teaching
the
boys
gentleness
and
good
manners
i
do
know
how
it
would
have
worked
ester
was
never
well
enough
to
undertake
it
nor
could
she
seem
to
enlist
any
one
else
in
such
service
it
has
grave
objections
i
suppose
but
i
have
always
thought
that
i
should
like
to
see
something
of
the
kind
carefully
roberts
before
this
little
story
was
had
turned
those
eager
eyes
of
hers
on
the
speaker
eyes
that
always
had
a
peculiar
light
in
them
whenever
her
soul
took
in
a
new
suggestion
thank
you
she
said
i
see
oh
a
great
many
things
i
ought
to
have
called
in
that
dear
sister
ester
to
help
on
this
phase
of
the
question
before
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
as
though
we
were
doing
her
chapter
xxxi
their
works
do
follow
them
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
effort
there
were
certain
young
ladies
becoming
to
roberts
by
reason
of
a
similarity
of
tastes
which
drew
them
to
her
she
sat
down
one
day
and
wrote
out
their
names
with
great
care
on
her
tablets
miss
henderson
name
headed
the
list
she
was
one
of
the
aristocrats
i
use
the
word
in
its
highest
sense
the
accidents
of
wealth
and
position
were
hers
at
least
that
is
the
way
we
talk
though
i
suppose
we
all
believe
that
the
lord
is
the
giver
of
both
and
will
require
an
account
of
the
same
at
our
hands
if
this
be
so
miss
henderson
will
be
more
ready
than
some
with
her
rendering
for
she
is
of
royal
blood
and
guards
well
the
honor
of
the
christian
name
she
bears
without
hesitation
miss
henderson
headed
the
list
the
others
were
chosen
more
slowly
ten
of
them
picked
soldiers
to
do
special
duty
in
his
it
required
much
explanation
much
care
to
plan
wisely
but
the
girls
caught
at
the
idea
in
the
course
of
weeks
they
formed
a
band
with
miss
henderson
for
president
ostensibly
they
were
a
literary
society
really
they
were
diamond
polishers
they
met
one
evening
by
invitation
with
roberts
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
monday
they
sang
for
them
read
for
them
heard
them
read
chatted
with
them
on
the
various
topics
of
the
hour
the
last
lecture
of
the
course
which
all
had
attended
a
certain
book
carefully
read
and
criticised
by
and
roberts
and
everett
in
the
monday
club
not
so
carefully
read
by
the
young
ladies
therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
somewhat
worsted
in
an
argument
concerning
it
which
was
bad
neither
for
the
young
ladies
nor
the
monday
club
finally
they
were
taken
out
to
supper
by
these
young
men
who
had
so
far
come
under
robert
influence
that
they
were
willing
to
endure
torture
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
her
it
is
a
long
story
i
could
write
another
book
about
it
just
as
well
as
not
the
main
difficulty
would
be
that
the
critics
would
pronounce
the
story
overdrawn
they
always
do
when
one
revels
in
facts
it
is
only
when
an
author
keeps
within
the
range
of
sober
fiction
that
he
may
feel
comparatively
safe
from
this
charge
these
young
ladies
represented
other
parlors
and
other
they
arranged
for
little
graceful
entertainments
to
which
the
monday
club
was
invited
gradually
others
were
invited
too
good
solid
men
and
motherly
women
the
invitations
were
select
the
polishers
were
chosen
with
care
but
it
was
surprising
to
these
workers
to
find
how
large
the
christian
world
is
and
how
many
stood
ready
to
help
if
they
were
shown
love
it
is
one
of
the
best
suggestions
that
that
dear
ester
has
given
this
roberts
said
one
evening
when
the
young
ladies
band
and
the
monday
club
combined
their
forces
and
gave
an
entertainment
to
some
of
the
best
people
on
the
avenue
i
have
given
you
hints
of
how
they
did
it
they
were
every
one
christians
these
young
ladies
none
others
were
chosen
they
worked
with
a
single
aim
in
view
his
glory
they
took
no
step
that
was
not
paved
with
prayer
do
you
need
to
be
told
that
they
succeeded
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
colson
chatted
with
miss
henderson
with
perfect
freedom
and
why
his
bow
was
graceful
and
easy
when
she
introduced
him
to
her
friend
miss
fanshawe
of
philadelphia
he
was
accustomed
to
being
introduced
to
her
friends
i
sure
i
hope
you
wish
i
would
tell
you
somewhat
of
mart
colson
if
you
are
not
deeply
interested
in
her
i
am
disappointed
in
you
she
has
been
such
an
object
of
interest
to
me
since
that
time
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
once
through
the
with
a
gleam
of
sunset
making
her
hair
into
gold
it
is
a
summer
evening
of
which
i
tell
you
and
she
is
all
in
white
except
her
eyes
nothing
can
be
bluer
than
they
are
and
except
the
flowers
about
her
she
is
always
among
the
flowers
i
hesitate
after
all
to
tell
you
about
mart
hers
is
one
of
those
stories
hard
to
tell
besides
her
friend
and
patron
has
suffered
much
criticism
because
of
her
and
though
roberts
does
not
care
in
the
least
i
find
that
i
am
sensitive
has
she
really
kept
that
colson
girl
with
her
all
these
years
yes
she
has
i
speak
it
meekly
but
she
has
and
never
had
her
learn
a
trade
or
work
in
a
factory
or
learn
to
support
herself
in
any
way
she
has
never
sent
her
anywhere
to
learn
a
trade
or
to
work
in
a
factory
or
to
stand
behind
a
counter
it
is
too
true
no
i
was
almost
sure
you
did
not
approve
of
it
but
for
all
that
i
do
mean
to
argue
roberts
cause
to
her
own
master
she
standeth
or
not
but
what
roberts
has
argued
on
occasion
with
gracie
dennis
for
instance
who
paid
her
a
few
weeks
visit
less
than
three
months
after
she
first
went
home
flossy
she
would
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
girl
do
you
really
mean
to
keep
her
here
she
has
no
mother
my
child
nor
father
and
her
brother
is
not
able
to
care
for
her
yet
where
would
you
have
me
send
her
why
flossy
there
are
yes
my
dear
i
know
it
and
this
is
one
of
well
but
she
ought
to
be
learning
things
how
is
she
going
to
support
herself
she
is
studying
arithmetic
with
me
you
know
and
writing
and
reading
with
the
girls
and
i
am
teaching
her
music
and
roberts
proposes
to
have
her
join
the
history
class
as
soon
as
she
is
sufficiently
advanced
in
the
more
common
but
flossy
shipley
that
is
great
nonsense
you
know
what
i
mean
you
can
not
turn
the
world
upside
down
in
that
fashion
or
make
an
orphan
asylum
of
your
house
or
a
charity
my
dear
do
you
really
think
the
house
is
in
danger
does
it
look
like
an
orphan
asylum
or
feel
like
a
charity
school
then
would
gracie
dennis
laugh
but
look
a
trifle
vexed
nevertheless
and
mutter
that
people
could
do
things
that
way
in
this
world
then
would
flossy
be
ready
with
her
gentle
drops
of
oil
to
soothe
the
ruffles
gracie
dear
i
am
not
trying
to
reform
the
world
there
are
a
great
many
girls
left
destitute
i
know
and
i
will
do
at
wholesale
all
i
can
for
them
but
this
one
is
peculiar
you
have
admitted
that
it
was
unusual
to
see
such
dangerous
beauty
and
she
is
unusual
in
her
mental
development
she
could
be
fierce
and
wicked
she
is
ignorant
and
bitter
about
many
things
i
am
afraid
for
her
i
have
not
been
able
to
think
of
a
place
where
the
lord
jesus
would
have
me
take
her
i
must
see
to
it
that
is
pleased
you
know
at
all
hazards
if
he
does
not
mean
us
to
keep
her
in
the
shelter
of
our
home
for
the
present
we
do
not
know
what
he
means
we
can
not
the
whole
race
he
has
not
even
suggested
it
to
our
hearts
he
has
simply
said
take
this
one
there
is
room
for
her
keep
her
until
i
plainly
tell
you
that
her
place
is
elsewhere
gracie
would
you
have
me
tell
him
we
can
not
by
this
time
gracie
would
be
humble
and
sweet
it
is
very
good
of
you
she
would
say
meekly
and
i
was
not
thinking
of
such
a
thing
as
finding
fault
i
was
only
wondering
whether
whether
well
you
know
whether
such
a
life
as
she
is
leading
in
your
house
would
not
unfit
her
for
her
proper
sphere
but
a
sentence
like
that
was
always
liable
to
put
little
roberts
on
all
the
dignity
she
possessed
her
husband
had
ideas
on
that
subject
and
had
imbued
her
with
them
her
voice
could
even
sound
almost
haughty
as
she
said
as
to
that
gracie
we
must
remember
that
the
of
an
american
woman
is
the
one
that
she
can
fill
acceptably
in
god
sight
he
may
call
her
to
the
highest
i
do
know
since
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
king
there
may
be
no
spot
on
his
footstool
too
high
for
his
intentions
concerning
there
was
outside
criticism
of
course
indeed
roberts
was
sufficiently
peculiar
in
many
respects
to
call
for
much
criticism
from
the
world
they
talked
much
about
that
girl
she
had
picked
up
gradually
they
said
that
colson
girl
then
one
day
some
daughter
asked
is
she
really
a
sister
of
that
handsome
colson
in
the
store
and
there
were
some
who
spoke
of
her
as
mattie
that
was
the
name
which
roberts
always
called
her
it
began
gradually
to
be
known
also
that
mattie
colson
knew
a
great
deal
which
was
worth
knowing
three
years
of
companionship
with
a
lady
like
roberts
and
such
as
she
gathers
about
her
can
do
much
for
a
girl
who
wishes
much
done
for
her
as
to
earning
her
living
i
am
not
sure
but
she
was
learning
to
do
it
in
several
ways
roberts
struggled
against
all
false
ideas
of
life
therefore
taught
her
none
she
was
not
the
cook
but
she
could
and
had
on
occasion
served
up
a
most
enjoyable
breakfast
she
was
not
the
yet
her
fingers
were
undeniably
skilful
in
the
arrangement
of
rooms
and
tables
she
was
not
the
yet
constant
were
the
calls
on
fingers
that
had
become
wise
in
these
directions
she
was
by
no
means
the
nurse
yet
there
was
a
little
flossy
in
the
sunny
room
upstairs
whose
devoted
slave
she
was
and
whose
mother
felt
that
mattie
loving
watchful
care
over
her
darling
was
only
second
to
her
own
and
was
so
to
be
relied
upon
by
day
and
night
as
to
repay
tenfold
whatever
she
might
have
done
for
the
girl
in
fact
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
to
define
mart
colon
position
in
the
house
yet
she
was
as
i
said
becoming
known
among
the
young
ladies
outside
as
mattie
colson
that
handsome
young
colson
sister
as
pretty
as
a
doll
and
a
of
that
lovely
roberts
you
as
for
the
young
ladies
band
i
do
not
include
them
when
i
talk
of
the
girls
outside
what
they
had
done
for
mattie
colson
she
could
not
have
told
you
though
she
tried
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
the
days
had
come
wherein
the
very
matrons
who
had
said
that
it
was
a
strange
thing
for
roberts
to
take
a
girl
from
the
slums
into
her
family
that
it
was
tempting
providence
to
attempt
such
violent
wrenches
now
said
one
to
another
that
it
must
be
a
great
relief
to
roberts
to
have
that
mattie
colson
always
at
her
elbow
to
see
that
everything
about
the
home
was
just
as
it
should
be
and
they
added
with
a
sigh
that
some
people
were
very
now
dear
critic
you
stand
all
ready
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
nice
story
but
that
in
actual
life
attempts
at
doing
good
do
not
result
so
smoothly
that
to
be
natural
roberts
ought
at
least
to
have
tried
in
vain
to
reclaim
half
of
her
boys
it
is
true
i
have
said
nothing
to
you
about
two
or
three
whom
she
has
not
as
yet
reached
though
she
is
still
trying
my
story
was
not
of
them
but
of
the
twenty
whom
she
reach
concerning
your
verdict
there
are
two
things
that
i
want
to
say
first
go
into
the
work
and
give
the
time
and
patience
and
faith
and
prayer
that
roberts
and
her
gave
before
you
decide
that
it
is
vain
and
secondly
will
you
kindly
remember
that
whether
this
be
natural
or
not
it
is
true
i
do
not
think
i
have
told
you
the
immediate
occasion
of
this
particular
gathering
it
was
in
fact
a
reception
given
to
ried
it
is
not
likely
that
i
need
tell
you
at
this
late
day
that
her
name
was
ried
i
could
have
told
you
much
about
it
had
i
been
writing
a
story
of
that
sort
in
fact
there
is
a
chance
for
considerable
romancing
there
are
matters
of
interest
that
i
might
tell
you
about
mr
colson
himself
young
as
he
is
and
about
mattie
who
wears
a
rose
that
she
did
not
pick
from
the
conservatory
but
i
do
mean
to
tell
it
i
have
just
one
other
bit
of
history
to
give
you
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
the
young
bridegroom
and
the
lady
with
whom
he
had
faithfully
worked
ever
since
that
rainy
afternoon
in
which
he
had
confided
his
gloom
to
her
both
were
looking
at
the
two
young
men
who
stood
near
the
piano
waiting
to
join
in
the
chorus
both
had
known
these
young
men
as
nimble
dick
and
black
still
another
of
the
original
seven
stood
in
the
immediate
vicinity
the
glances
of
the
two
workers
took
them
all
in
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
meaningly
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
first
sunday
afternoon
said
roberts
i
asked
them
to
pick
up
my
handkerchief
which
had
dropped
and
dick
said
it
up
yourself
mum
you
as
able
to
as
we
be
i
wonder
if
they
would
remember
it
what
if
i
should
tell
them
as
she
spoke
the
bit
of
cambric
in
her
hand
designedly
dropped
almost
at
the
feet
of
dirk
colson
he
stooped
for
it
instantly
but
nimble
dick
was
too
quick
for
him
and
presented
it
to
the
owner
with
a
graceful
bow
and
a
slightly
triumphant
smile
but
the
chorus
was
commencing
and
the
bass
and
tenor
were
at
once
absorbed
in
their
work
so
ried
and
roberts
had
the
memorial
laugh
all
to
themselves
none
but
they
understood
what
the
white
handkerchief
said
despite
the
laughter
there
was
a
suspicious
mist
in
ried
eyes
how
far
is
mirth
removed
from
tears
he
asked
his
hostess
and
then
do
you
know
when
i
look
at
these
young
men
moving
about
your
rooms
at
their
ease
really
ornaments
to
society
and
think
of
the
places
in
the
world
that
they
will
be
likely
to
fill
and
think
of
what
they
were
when
you
first
saw
them
the
overwhelming
contrast
brings
the
tears
said
roberts
i
will
tell
you
something
that
will
do
your
heart
good
did
you
know
that
our
young
lady
helpers
had
reorganized
in
larger
force
and
with
certain
fixed
lines
of
work
which
they
feel
certain
they
can
do
the
effort
has
passed
out
of
the
realm
of
mere
experiment
they
have
chosen
a
name
they
are
henceforth
to
be
known
as
the
ester
ried
band
they
came

me
for
a
motto
to

and
their
works
do
follow
them
