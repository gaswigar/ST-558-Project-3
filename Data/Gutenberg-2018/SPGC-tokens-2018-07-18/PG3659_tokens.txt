chapter
i
enter
the
duchess
the
peaceful
stillness
of
an
english
summer
afternoon
brooded
over
the
park
and
gardens
at
overdene
a
hush
of
moving
sunlight
and
lengthening
shadows
lay
upon
the
lawn
and
a
promise
of
refreshing
coolness
made
the
shade
of
the
great
cedar
tree
a
place
to
be
desired
the
old
stone
house
solid
substantial
and
unadorned
suggested
unlimited
spaciousness
and
comfort
within
and
was
redeemed
from
positive
ugliness
without
by
the
fine
ivy
magnolia
trees
and
wistaria
of
many
years
growth
climbing
its
plain
face
and
now
covering
it
with
a
mantle
of
soft
green
large
white
blooms
and
a
cascade
of
purple
blossom
a
terrace
ran
the
full
length
of
the
house
bounded
at
one
end
by
a
large
conservatory
at
the
other
by
an
aviary
wide
stone
steps
at
intervals
led
down
from
the
terrace
on
to
the
soft
springy
turf
of
the
lawn
beyond
the
wide
park
clumps
of
old
trees
haunted
by
shy
brown
deer
and
through
the
trees
fitful
gleams
of
the
river
a
narrow
silver
ribbon
winding
gracefully
in
and
out
between
long
grass
buttercups
and
the
pointed
to
four
the
birds
were
having
their
hour
of
silence
not
a
trill
sounded
from
among
the
softly
moving
leaves
not
a
chirp
not
a
twitter
the
stillness
seemed
almost
oppressive
the
one
brilliant
spot
of
colour
in
the
landscape
was
a
large
scarlet
macaw
asleep
on
his
stand
under
the
cedar
at
last
came
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
a
quaint
old
figure
stepped
out
on
to
the
terrace
walked
its
entire
length
to
the
right
and
disappeared
into
the
the
duchess
of
meldrum
had
gone
to
cut
her
roses
she
wore
an
ancient
straw
hat
of
the
shape
known
as
mushroom
tied
with
black
ribbons
beneath
her
portly
chin
a
loose
brown
holland
coat
a
very
short
tweed
skirt
and
engadine
gouties
she
had
on
some
very
old
gauntlet
gloves
and
carried
a
wooden
basket
and
a
huge
pair
of
scissors
a
wag
had
once
remarked
that
if
you
met
her
grace
of
meldrum
returning
from
gardening
or
feeding
her
poultry
and
were
in
a
charitable
frame
of
mind
you
would
very
likely
give
her
sixpence
but
after
you
had
thus
drawn
her
attention
to
yourself
and
she
looked
at
you
sir
walter
raleigh
cloak
would
not
be
in
it
your
one
possible
course
would
be
to
collapse
into
the
mud
and
let
the
ducal
gouties
trample
on
you
this
the
duchess
would
do
with
gusto
then
accept
your
apologies
with
good
nature
and
keep
your
sixpence
to
show
when
she
told
the
story
the
duchess
lived
alone
that
is
to
say
she
had
no
desire
for
the
perpetual
companionship
of
any
of
her
own
kith
and
kin
nor
for
the
constant
smiles
and
flattery
of
a
paid
companion
her
pale
daughter
whom
she
had
systematically
snubbed
had
married
her
handsome
son
whom
she
had
adored
and
spoiled
had
prematurely
died
before
the
death
a
few
years
since
of
thomas
fifth
duke
of
meldrum
he
had
come
to
a
sudden
and
as
the
duchess
often
remarked
very
suitable
end
for
on
his
birthday
clad
in
all
the
splendours
of
his
hunting
scarlet
top
hat
and
buff
corduroy
breeches
the
mare
he
was
mercilessly
putting
at
an
impossible
fence
suddenly
refused
and
thomas
duke
of
meldrum
shot
into
a
field
of
turnips
pitched
upon
his
head
and
spoke
no
more
this
sudden
cessation
of
his
noisy
and
fiery
life
meant
a
complete
transformation
in
the
entourage
of
the
duchess
hitherto
she
had
had
to
tolerate
the
boon
companions
congenial
to
himself
with
whom
he
chose
to
fill
the
house
or
to
invite
those
of
her
own
friends
to
whom
she
could
explain
thomas
and
who
suffered
thomas
gladly
out
of
friendship
for
her
and
enjoyment
of
lovely
overdene
but
even
then
the
duchess
had
no
pleasure
in
her
parties
for
quaint
rough
diamond
though
she
herself
might
appear
the
bluest
of
blue
blood
ran
in
her
veins
and
though
her
manner
had
the
abruptness
and
disregard
of
other
people
feelings
not
unfrequently
found
in
old
ladies
of
high
rank
she
was
at
heart
a
true
gentlewoman
and
could
always
be
trusted
to
say
and
do
the
right
thing
in
moments
of
importance
the
late
language
had
been
sulphurous
and
his
manners
georgian
and
when
he
had
been
laid
in
the
unwonted
quiet
of
his
ancestral
vault
so
unlike
him
poor
dear
as
the
duchess
remarked
that
it
is
quite
a
comfort
to
know
he
is
not
really
there
her
grace
looked
around
her
and
began
to
realise
the
beauties
and
possibilities
of
overdene
at
first
she
contented
herself
with
gardening
making
an
aviary
and
surrounding
herself
with
all
sorts
of
queer
birds
and
beasts
upon
whom
she
lavished
the
affection
which
of
late
years
had
known
no
human
outlet
but
after
a
while
her
natural
inclination
to
hospitality
her
humorous
enjoyment
of
other
people
foibles
and
a
quaint
delight
in
parading
her
own
led
to
constant
succession
of
at
overdene
which
soon
became
known
as
a
liberty
hall
of
varied
delights
where
you
always
met
the
people
you
most
wanted
to
meet
found
every
facility
for
enjoying
your
favourite
pastime
were
fed
and
housed
in
perfect
style
and
spent
some
of
the
most
ideal
days
of
your
summer
or
cheery
days
of
your
winter
never
dull
never
bored
free
to
come
and
go
as
you
pleased
and
everything
seasoned
everybody
with
the
delightful
sauce
piquante
of
never
being
quite
sure
what
the
duchess
would
do
or
say
next
she
mentally
arranged
her
parties
under
three
heads
freak
parties
mere
people
parties
and
best
parties
a
best
party
was
in
progress
on
the
lovely
june
day
when
the
duchess
having
enjoyed
an
unusually
long
siesta
donned
what
she
called
her
garden
togs
and
sallied
forth
to
cut
roses
as
she
tramped
along
the
terrace
and
passed
through
the
little
iron
gate
leading
to
the
tommy
the
scarlet
macaw
opened
one
eye
and
watched
her
gave
a
loud
kiss
as
she
reached
the
gate
and
disappeared
from
view
then
laughed
to
himself
and
went
to
sleep
again
of
all
the
many
pets
tommy
was
prime
favourite
he
represented
the
duchess
one
concession
to
morbid
sentiment
after
the
demise
of
the
duke
she
had
found
it
so
depressing
to
be
invariably
addressed
with
suave
deference
by
every
male
voice
she
heard
if
the
butler
could
have
snorted
or
the
rector
have
rapped
out
an
uncomplimentary
adjective
the
duchess
would
have
felt
cheered
as
it
was
a
fixed
and
settled
melancholy
lay
upon
her
spirit
until
she
saw
in
a
dealer
list
an
advertisement
of
a
prize
macaw
warranted
a
grand
talker
with
a
vocabulary
of
over
five
hundred
words
the
duchess
went
immediately
to
town
paid
a
visit
to
the
dealer
heard
a
few
of
the
macaw
words
and
the
tone
in
which
he
said
them
bought
him
on
the
spot
and
took
him
down
to
overdene
the
first
evening
he
sat
crossly
on
the
perch
of
his
grand
new
stand
declining
to
say
a
single
one
of
his
five
hundred
words
though
the
duchess
spent
her
evening
in
the
hall
sitting
in
every
possible
place
first
close
to
him
then
away
in
a
distant
corner
in
an
placed
behind
a
screen
reading
with
her
back
turned
feigning
not
to
notice
him
facing
him
with
concentrated
attention
tommy
merely
clicked
his
tongue
at
her
every
time
she
emerged
from
a
or
if
the
rather
worried
butler
or
nervous
passed
hurriedly
through
the
hall
sent
showers
of
kisses
after
them
and
then
went
into
fits
of
ventriloquial
laughter
the
duchess
in
despair
even
tried
reminding
him
in
a
whisper
of
the
remarks
he
had
made
in
the
shop
but
tommy
only
winked
at
her
and
put
his
claw
over
his
beak
still
she
enjoyed
his
flushed
and
scarlet
appearance
and
retired
to
rest
hopeful
and
in
no
wise
regretting
her
bargain
the
next
morning
it
became
instantly
evident
to
the
who
swept
the
hall
the
footman
who
sorted
the
letters
and
the
butler
who
sounded
the
breakfast
gong
that
a
good
night
rest
had
restored
to
tommy
the
full
use
of
his
vocabulary
and
when
the
duchess
came
sailing
down
the
stairs
ten
minutes
after
the
gong
had
sounded
and
tommy
flapping
his
wings
angrily
shrieked
at
her
now
then
old
girl
come
on
she
went
to
breakfast
in
a
more
cheerful
mood
than
she
had
known
for
months
past
chapter
ii
introduces
the
honourable
jane
the
only
one
of
her
relatives
who
practically
made
her
home
with
the
duchess
was
her
niece
and
former
ward
the
honourable
jane
champion
and
this
consisted
merely
in
the
fact
that
the
honourable
jane
was
the
one
person
who
might
invite
herself
to
overdene
or
portland
place
arrive
when
she
chose
stay
as
long
as
she
pleased
and
leave
when
it
suited
her
convenience
on
the
death
of
her
father
when
her
lonely
girlhood
in
her
norfolk
home
came
to
an
end
she
would
gladly
have
filled
the
place
of
a
daughter
to
the
duchess
but
the
duchess
did
not
require
a
daughter
and
a
daughter
with
pronounced
views
plenty
of
of
her
own
a
fine
figure
and
a
plain
face
would
have
seemed
to
her
grace
of
meldrum
a
peculiarly
undesirable
acquisition
so
jane
was
given
to
understand
that
she
might
come
whenever
she
liked
and
stay
as
long
as
she
liked
but
on
the
same
footing
as
other
people
this
meant
liberty
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
and
no
responsibility
towards
her
aunt
guests
the
duchess
preferred
managing
her
own
parties
in
her
oven
way
jane
champion
was
now
in
her
thirtieth
year
she
had
once
been
described
by
one
who
saw
below
the
surface
as
a
perfectly
beautiful
woman
in
an
absolutely
plain
shell
and
no
man
had
as
yet
looked
beneath
the
shell
and
seen
the
woman
in
her
perfection
she
would
have
made
earth
heaven
for
a
blind
lover
who
not
having
eyes
for
the
plainness
of
her
face
or
the
massiveness
of
her
figure
might
have
drawn
nearer
and
apprehended
the
wonder
of
her
as
a
woman
experiencing
the
wealth
of
tenderness
of
which
she
was
capable
the
blessed
comfort
of
the
shelter
of
her
love
the
perfect
comprehension
of
her
sympathy
the
marvellous
joy
of
winning
and
wedding
her
but
as
yet
no
blind
man
with
vision
had
come
her
way
and
it
always
seemed
to
be
her
lot
to
take
a
second
place
on
occasions
when
she
would
have
filled
the
first
to
infinite
perfection
she
had
been
bridesmaid
at
weddings
where
the
charming
brides
notwithstanding
their
superficial
loveliness
possessed
few
of
the
qualifications
for
wifehood
with
which
she
was
so
richly
endowed
she
was
godmother
to
her
friends
babies
she
whose
motherhood
would
have
been
a
thing
for
wonder
and
worship
she
had
a
glorious
voice
but
her
face
not
matching
it
its
existence
was
rarely
suspected
and
as
she
accompanied
to
perfection
she
was
usually
in
requisition
to
play
for
the
singing
of
others
in
short
all
her
life
long
jane
had
filled
second
places
and
filled
them
very
contentedly
she
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
absolutely
first
with
any
one
her
mother
death
had
occurred
during
her
infancy
so
that
she
had
not
even
the
most
shadowy
remembrance
of
that
maternal
love
and
tenderness
which
she
used
sometimes
to
try
to
imagine
although
she
had
never
experienced
it
her
mother
maid
a
faithful
and
devoted
woman
dismissed
soon
after
the
death
of
her
mistress
chancing
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
some
twelve
years
later
called
at
the
manor
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
in
the
household
who
remembered
her
after
tea
fraulein
and
miss
jebb
being
out
of
the
way
she
was
spirited
up
into
the
schoolroom
to
see
miss
jane
her
heart
full
of
memories
of
the
sweet
babe
upon
whom
she
and
her
dear
lady
had
lavished
so
much
love
and
care
she
found
awaiting
her
a
tall
plain
girl
with
a
frank
boyish
manner
and
a
rather
disconcerting
way
as
she
afterwards
remarked
of
taking
stock
of
a
body
the
while
one
was
which
at
first
checked
the
flow
of
good
sarah
reminiscences
poured
forth
so
freely
in
the
housekeeper
room
below
and
reduced
her
to
looking
tearfully
around
the
room
remarking
that
she
remembered
choosing
the
blessed
with
her
dear
lady
now
gone
whose
joy
had
been
so
great
when
the
dear
babe
first
took
notice
and
reached
up
for
the
roses
and
i
can
show
you
miss
if
you
care
to
know
it
just
which
bunch
of
roses
it
were
but
before
sarah
visit
was
over
jane
had
heard
many
amongst
others
that
her
mother
used
to
kiss
her
little
hands
ah
many
a
time
she
did
miss
called
them
little
and
covered
them
with
kisses
the
child
utterly
unused
to
any
demonstrations
of
affection
looked
at
her
rather
ungainly
brown
hands
and
laughed
simply
because
she
was
ashamed
of
the
unwonted
tightening
at
her
throat
and
the
queer
stinging
of
tears
beneath
her
eyelids
thus
sarah
departed
under
the
impression
that
miss
jane
had
grown
up
into
a
rather
a
heartless
young
lady
but
fraulein
and
jebbie
never
knew
why
from
that
day
onward
the
hands
of
which
they
had
so
often
had
cause
to
complain
were
kept
scrupulously
clean
and
on
her
birthday
night
unashamed
in
the
quiet
darkness
the
lonely
little
child
kissed
her
own
hands
beneath
the
bedclothes
striving
thus
to
reach
the
tenderness
of
her
dead
mother
lips
and
in
after
years
when
she
became
her
own
mistress
one
of
her
first
actions
was
to
advertise
for
sarah
matthews
and
engage
her
as
her
own
maid
at
a
salary
which
enabled
the
good
woman
eventually
to
buy
herself
a
comfortable
annuity
jane
saw
but
little
of
her
father
who
had
found
it
difficult
to
forgive
her
firstly
for
being
a
girl
when
he
desired
a
son
secondly
being
a
girl
for
having
inherited
his
plainness
rather
than
her
mother
beauty
parents
are
apt
to
see
no
injustice
in
the
fact
that
they
are
often
annoyed
with
their
offspring
for
possessing
attributes
both
of
character
and
appearance
with
which
they
themselves
have
endowed
them
the
hero
of
jane
childhood
the
chum
of
her
girlhood
and
the
close
friend
of
her
maturer
years
was
deryck
brand
only
son
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
and
her
senior
by
nearly
ten
years
but
even
in
their
friendship
close
though
it
was
she
had
never
felt
herself
first
to
him
as
a
medical
student
at
home
during
vacations
his
mother
and
his
profession
took
precedence
in
his
mind
of
the
lonely
child
whose
devotion
pleased
him
and
whose
strong
character
and
original
mental
development
interested
him
later
on
he
married
a
lovely
girl
as
unlike
jane
as
one
woman
could
possibly
be
to
another
but
still
their
friendship
held
and
deepened
and
now
when
he
was
rapidly
advancing
to
the
very
front
rank
of
his
profession
her
appreciation
of
his
work
and
sympathetic
understanding
of
his
aims
and
efforts
meant
more
to
him
than
even
the
signal
mark
of
royal
favour
of
which
he
had
lately
been
the
recipient
jane
champion
had
no
close
friends
amongst
the
women
of
her
set
her
lonely
girlhood
had
bred
in
her
an
absolute
frankness
towards
herself
and
other
people
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
understand
or
tolerate
the
little
artificialities
of
society
or
the
trivial
weaknesses
of
her
own
sex
women
to
whom
she
had
shown
special
kindness
and
they
were
many
maintained
an
attitude
of
grateful
admiration
in
her
presence
and
of
cowardly
silence
in
her
absence
when
she
chanced
to
be
under
discussion
but
of
men
friends
she
had
many
especially
among
a
set
of
young
fellows
just
through
college
of
whom
she
made
particular
chums
nice
lads
who
wrote
to
her
of
their
college
and
scrapes
as
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
doing
to
their
own
mothers
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
called
her
old
jane
and
pretty
jane
and
dearest
jane
amongst
themselves
but
she
believed
in
the
harmlessness
of
their
fun
and
the
genuineness
of
their
affection
and
gave
them
a
generous
amount
of
her
own
in
return
jane
champion
happened
just
now
to
be
paying
one
of
her
long
visits
to
overdene
and
was
playing
golf
with
a
boy
for
whom
she
had
long
had
a
rod
in
pickle
on
this
summer
afternoon
when
the
duchess
went
to
cut
blooms
in
her
only
as
jane
found
out
you
can
not
decorously
lead
up
to
a
scolding
if
you
are
very
keen
on
golf
and
go
golfing
with
a
person
who
is
equally
enthusiastic
and
who
all
the
way
to
the
links
explains
exactly
how
he
played
every
hole
the
last
time
he
went
round
and
all
the
way
back
gloats
over
in
retrospection
the
way
you
and
he
have
played
every
hole
this
time
so
jane
considered
her
afternoon
didactically
a
failure
but
in
the
that
night
young
cathcart
explained
the
game
all
over
again
to
a
few
choice
spirits
and
then
remarked
old
jane
was
superb
fancy
such
a
drive
as
that
and
doing
number
seven
in
three
and
not
talking
about
it
i
jolly
well
made
up
my
mind
to
send
no
more
bouquets
to
hang
it
boys
you
ca
see
yourself
at
champagne
suppers
with
a
when
you
walked
round
the
links
on
a
day
like
this
with
the
honourable
jane
she
drives
like
a
rifle
shot
and
when
she
lofts
you
think
the
ball
was
a
swallow
and
beat
me
three
holes
up
and
never
mentioned
it
by
jove
a
fellow
wants
to
have
a
clean
bill
when
he
shakes
hands
with
her
chapter
iii
the
surprise
packet
the
pointed
to
half
past
four
the
hour
of
silence
appeared
to
be
over
the
birds
commenced
twittering
and
a
cuckoo
in
an
adjacent
wood
sounded
his
note
at
intervals
the
house
awoke
to
sudden
life
there
was
an
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
two
footmen
in
the
mulberry
and
silver
of
the
meldrum
livery
hurried
down
from
the
terrace
carrying
folding
with
which
they
supplemented
those
of
rustic
oak
standing
permanently
under
the
cedar
one
promptly
returned
to
the
house
while
the
other
remained
behind
spreading
snowy
cloths
over
each
table
the
macaw
awoke
stretched
his
wings
and
flapped
them
twice
then
sidled
up
and
down
his
perch
concentrating
his
attention
upon
the
footman
mind
he
exclaimed
suddenly
in
the
butler
voice
as
a
cloth
flung
on
too
hurriedly
fluttered
to
the
grass
hold
your
jaw
said
the
young
footman
irritably
flicking
the
bird
with
the
and
then
glancing
furtively
at
the
tommy
wants
a
gooseberry
shrieked
the
macaw
dodging
the
and
hanging
head
downwards
from
his
perch
do
you
wish
you
may
get
it
said
the
footman
viciously
give
it
him
somebody
remarked
tommy
in
the
duchess
voice
the
footman
started
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
then
hurriedly
told
tommy
just
what
he
thought
of
him
and
where
he
wished
him
cuffed
him
soundly
and
returned
to
the
house
followed
by
peals
of
laughter
mingled
with
exhortations
and
imprecations
from
the
angry
bird
who
danced
up
and
down
on
his
perch
until
his
enemy
had
vanished
from
view
a
few
minutes
later
the
tables
were
spread
with
the
large
variety
of
eatables
considered
necessary
at
an
english
afternoon
tea
the
massive
silver
urn
and
teapots
gleamed
on
the
behind
which
the
old
butler
presided
muffins
crumpets
cakes
and
every
kind
of
sandwich
supplemented
the
dainty
little
rolled
slices
of
white
and
brown
while
bowls
of
freshly
gathered
strawberries
lent
a
touch
of
colour
to
the
artistic
effect
of
white
and
silver
when
all
was
ready
the
butler
raised
his
hand
and
sounded
an
old
chinese
gong
hanging
in
the
cedar
tree
before
the
penetrating
boom
had
died
away
voices
were
heard
in
the
distance
from
all
over
the
grounds
up
from
the
river
down
from
the
tennis
courts
out
from
house
and
garden
came
the
duchess
guests
rejoicing
in
the
refreshing
prospect
of
tea
hurrying
to
the
welcome
shade
of
the
cedar
charming
women
in
white
carefully
guarding
their
complexions
beneath
shady
hats
and
picturesque
parasols
delightful
girls
who
had
long
ago
sacrificed
complexions
to
comfort
and
now
walked
across
the
lawn
bareheaded
swinging
their
rackets
and
discussing
the
last
set
men
in
flannels
sunburned
and
handsome
joining
in
the
talk
and
laughter
praising
their
partners
while
remaining
unobtrusively
silent
as
to
their
own
achievements
they
made
a
picturesque
group
as
they
gathered
under
the
tree
subsiding
with
immense
satisfaction
into
the
low
wicker
chairs
or
on
to
the
soft
turf
and
helping
themselves
to
what
they
pleased
when
all
were
supplied
with
tea
coffee
or
iced
drinks
to
their
liking
conversation
flowed
again
so
the
duchess
concert
comes
off
remarked
some
one
i
wish
to
goodness
they
would
hang
this
tree
with
chinese
lanterns
and
have
it
out
here
it
is
too
hot
to
face
a
crowded
function
indoors
oh
that
all
right
said
garth
dalmain
i
you
know
and
i
can
promise
you
that
all
the
long
windows
opening
on
to
the
terrace
shall
stand
wide
so
no
one
need
be
in
the
who
prefers
to
stop
outside
there
will
be
a
row
of
lounge
chairs
placed
on
the
terrace
near
the
windows
you
wo
see
much
but
you
will
hear
perfectly
ah
but
half
the
fun
is
in
seeing
exclaimed
one
of
the
tennis
girls
people
who
have
remained
on
the
terrace
will
miss
all
the
point
of
it
afterwards
when
the
dear
duchess
shows
us
how
everybody
did
it
i
care
how
hot
it
is
book
me
a
seat
in
the
front
row
who
is
the
surprise
packet
asked
lady
ingleby
who
had
arrived
since
luncheon
velma
said
mary
strathern
she
is
coming
for
the
and
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
her
no
one
but
the
duchess
could
have
worked
it
and
no
place
but
overdene
would
have
tempted
her
she
will
sing
only
one
song
at
the
concert
but
she
is
sure
to
break
forth
later
on
and
give
us
plenty
we
will
persuade
jane
to
drift
to
the
piano
accidentally
and
play
over
just
by
chance
the
opening
bars
of
some
of
velma
best
things
and
we
shall
soon
hear
the
magic
voice
she
never
can
resist
a
perfectly
played
accompaniment
why
call
madame
velma
the
packet
asked
a
girl
to
whom
the
overdene
best
parties
were
a
new
experience
that
my
dear
replied
lady
ingleby
is
a
little
joke
of
the
duchess
this
concert
is
arranged
for
the
amusement
of
her
house
party
and
for
the
gratification
and
glorification
of
local
celebrities
the
whole
neighbourhood
is
invited
none
of
you
are
asked
to
perform
but
local
celebrities
are
in
fact
they
furnish
the
entire
programme
to
their
own
delight
the
satisfaction
of
their
friends
and
relatives
and
our
entertainment
particularly
afterwards
when
the
duchess
takes
us
through
every
item
with
original
notes
comments
and
impersonations
oh
dal
do
you
remember
when
she
tucked
a
sheet
of
white
into
her
for
a
dog
collar
and
took
off
the
curate
nervously
singing
a
comic
song
then
at
the
very
end
you
see
and
really
some
of
it
is
quite
good
for
amateurs
she
trots
out
velma
or
some
equally
perfect
artiste
to
show
them
how
it
really
can
be
done
and
suddenly
the
place
is
full
of
music
and
a
great
hush
falls
on
the
audience
and
the
poor
complacent
amateurs
realise
that
the
noise
they
have
been
making
was
after
all
not
music
and
they
go
dumbly
home
but
they
have
forgotten
all
about
it
by
the
following
year
or
a
fresh
contingent
of
willing
performers
steps
into
the
breach
the
duchess
little
joke
always
comes
off
the
honourable
jane
does
not
approve
of
it
said
young
ronald
ingram
therefore
she
is
generally
given
marching
orders
and
departs
to
her
next
visit
before
the
event
but
no
one
can
accompany
madame
velma
so
perfectly
so
this
time
she
is
commanded
to
stay
but
i
doubt
if
the
packet
will
come
off
with
quite
such
a
shock
as
usual
and
i
am
certain
the
fun
wo
be
so
good
afterwards
the
honourable
jane
has
been
known
to
jump
on
the
duchess
for
that
sort
of
thing
she
is
safe
to
get
the
worst
of
it
at
the
time
but
it
has
a
restraining
effect
afterwards
i
think
miss
champion
is
quite
right
said
a
american
girl
bravely
holding
a
gold
spoon
poised
for
a
moment
over
the
strawberry
with
which
garth
dalmain
had
supplied
her
in
my
country
we
should
call
it
real
mean
to
laugh
at
people
who
had
been
our
guests
and
performed
in
our
houses
in
your
country
my
dear
said
myra
ingleby
you
have
no
duchesses
well
we
supply
you
with
quite
a
good
few
replied
the
american
girl
calmly
and
went
on
with
her
ice
a
general
laugh
followed
and
the
latest
match
came
up
for
discussion
where
is
the
honourable
jane
inquired
someone
presently
golfing
with
billy
said
ronald
ingram
ah
here
they
come
jane
tall
figure
was
seen
walking
along
the
terrace
accompanied
by
billy
cathcart
talking
eagerly
they
put
their
clubs
away
in
the
lower
hall
then
came
down
the
lawn
together
to
the
jane
wore
a
coat
and
skirt
of
grey
tweed
a
blue
and
white
cambric
shirt
starched
linen
collar
and
cuffs
a
silk
tie
and
a
soft
felt
hat
with
a
few
black
quills
in
it
she
walked
with
the
freedom
of
movement
and
swing
of
limb
which
indicate
great
strength
and
a
body
well
under
control
her
appearance
was
extraordinarily
unlike
that
of
all
the
pretty
and
graceful
women
grouped
beneath
the
cedar
tree
and
yet
it
was
in
no
sense
masculine
or
to
use
a
more
appropriate
word
mannish
for
everything
strong
is
masculine
but
a
woman
who
apes
an
appearance
of
strength
which
she
does
not
possess
is
mannish
rather
was
it
so
truly
feminine
that
she
could
afford
to
adopt
a
severe
simplicity
of
attire
which
suited
admirably
the
decided
plainness
of
her
features
and
the
almost
massive
proportions
of
her
figure
she
stepped
into
the
circle
beneath
the
cedar
and
took
one
of
the
places
immediately
vacated
by
the
men
with
the
complete
absence
of
which
always
characterised
her
what
did
you
go
round
in
miss
champion
inquired
one
of
the
men
my
ordinary
clothes
replied
jane
quoting
punch
and
evading
the
question
but
billy
burst
out
she
went
round
in
oh
be
quiet
billy
interposed
jane
you
and
i
are
practically
the
only
golf
maniacs
present
most
of
these
dear
people
are
even
ignorant
as
to
who
is
or
why
we
should
be
so
proud
of
beating
him
where
is
my
aunt
poor
simmons
was
toddling
all
over
the
place
when
we
went
in
to
put
away
our
clubs
searching
for
her
with
a
telegram
why
did
you
open
it
asked
myra
because
my
aunt
never
allows
her
telegrams
to
be
opened
she
loves
shocks
and
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
a
telegram
containing
startling
news
she
says
it
completely
spoils
it
if
some
one
else
knows
it
first
and
breaks
it
to
her
gently
here
comes
the
duchess
said
garth
dalmain
who
was
sitting
where
he
could
see
the
little
gate
into
the
do
not
mention
the
telegram
cautioned
jane
it
would
not
please
her
that
i
should
even
know
of
its
arrival
it
would
be
a
shame
to
take
any
of
the
bloom
off
the
unexpected
delight
of
a
wire
on
this
hot
day
when
nothing
unusual
seemed
likely
to
happen
they
turned
and
looked
towards
the
duchess
as
she
bustled
across
the
lawn
this
quaint
old
figure
who
had
called
them
together
who
owned
the
lovely
place
where
they
were
spending
such
delightful
days
and
whose
odd
whimsicalities
had
been
so
freely
discussed
while
they
drank
her
tea
and
feasted
off
her
strawberries
the
men
rose
as
she
approached
but
not
quite
so
spontaneously
as
they
had
done
for
her
niece
the
duchess
carried
a
large
wooden
basket
filled
to
overflowing
with
exquisite
roses
every
bloom
was
perfect
and
each
had
been
cut
at
exactly
the
right
moment
chapter
iv
jane
volunteers
the
duchess
plumped
down
her
basket
in
the
middle
of
the
strawberry
table
there
good
people
she
said
rather
breathlessly
help
yourselves
and
let
me
see
you
all
wearing
roses
and
the
is
to
be
a
bower
of
roses
we
will
call
it
fete
des
roses
no
thank
you
ronnie
that
tea
has
been
made
half
an
hour
at
least
and
you
ought
to
love
me
too
well
to
press
it
upon
me
besides
i
never
take
tea
i
have
a
whiskey
and
soda
when
i
wake
from
my
nap
and
that
sustains
me
until
dinner
oh
yes
my
dear
myra
i
know
i
came
to
your
interesting
meeting
and
signed
that
excellent
pledge
encourager
les
autres
but
i
drove
straight
to
my
doctor
when
i
left
your
house
and
he
gave
me
a
certificate
to
say
i
must
take
something
when
i
needed
it
and
i
always
need
it
when
i
wake
from
my
nap
really
dal
it
is
positively
wicked
for
any
man
off
the
stage
to
look
as
picturesque
as
you
do
in
that
pale
violet
shirt
and
dark
violet
tie
and
those
white
flannels
if
i
were
your
grandmother
i
should
send
you
in
to
take
them
off
if
you
turn
the
heads
of
old
dowagers
such
as
i
am
what
chance
have
all
these
chickens
hush
tommy
that
was
a
very
naughty
word
and
you
need
not
be
jealous
of
dal
i
admire
you
still
more
dal
will
you
paint
my
scarlet
macaw
the
young
artist
whose
portraits
in
that
year
academy
had
created
much
interest
in
the
artistic
world
and
whose
violet
shirt
had
just
been
so
severely
censured
lay
back
in
his
with
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
a
gleam
of
amusement
in
his
bright
brown
eyes
no
dear
duchess
he
said
i
beg
respectfully
to
decline
the
commission
tommy
would
require
a
landseer
to
do
full
justice
to
his
attitudes
and
expression
besides
it
would
be
demoralising
to
an
innocent
and
youth
such
as
you
know
me
to
be
to
spend
long
hours
in
tommy
society
listening
to
the
remarks
that
sweet
bird
would
make
while
i
painted
him
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
paint
you
dear
duchess
only
not
in
that
hat
ever
since
i
was
quite
a
small
boy
a
straw
hat
with
black
ribbons
tied
under
the
chin
has
made
me
feel
ill
if
i
yielded
to
my
natural
impulses
now
i
should
hide
my
face
in
miss
champion
lap
and
kick
and
scream
until
you
took
it
off
i
will
paint
you
in
the
black
velvet
gown
you
wore
last
night
with
the
medici
collar
and
the
jolly
arrangement
of
lace
and
diamonds
on
your
head
and
in
your
hand
you
shall
hold
an
antique
crystal
mirror
mounted
in
silver
the
artist
half
closed
his
eyes
and
as
he
described
his
picture
in
a
voice
full
of
music
and
mystery
an
attentive
hush
fell
upon
the
gay
group
around
him
when
garth
dalmain
described
his
pictures
people
saw
them
when
they
walked
into
the
academy
or
the
new
gallery
the
following
year
they
would
say
ah
there
it
is
just
as
we
saw
it
that
day
before
a
stroke
of
it
was
on
the
canvas
in
your
left
hand
you
shall
hold
the
mirror
but
you
shall
not
be
looking
into
it
because
you
never
look
into
mirrors
dear
duchess
excepting
to
see
whether
the
scolding
you
are
giving
your
maid
as
she
stands
behind
you
is
making
her
cry
and
whether
that
is
why
she
is
being
so
clumsy
in
her
manipulation
of
pins
and
things
if
it
is
you
promptly
promise
her
a
day
off
to
go
and
see
her
old
mother
and
pay
her
journey
there
and
back
if
it
is
you
scold
her
some
more
were
i
the
maid
i
should
always
cry
large
tears
warranted
to
show
in
the
glass
only
i
should
not
sniff
because
sniffing
is
so
intensely
aggravating
and
i
should
be
most
frightfully
careful
that
my
tears
did
not
run
down
your
neck
dal
you
ridiculous
child
said
the
duchess
leave
off
talking
about
my
maids
and
my
neck
and
your
crocodile
tears
and
finish
describing
the
portrait
what
do
i
do
with
the
mirror
you
do
not
look
into
it
continued
garth
dalmain
meditatively
because
we
know
that
is
a
thing
you
never
do
even
when
you
put
on
that
hat
and
tie
those
ribbons
miss
champion
i
wish
you
would
hold
my
hand
in
a
bow
under
your
chin
you
do
consult
the
mirror
but
you
shall
sit
with
it
in
your
left
hand
your
elbow
resting
on
an
eastern
table
of
black
ebony
inlaid
with
you
will
turn
it
from
you
so
that
it
reflects
something
exactly
in
front
of
you
in
the
imaginary
foreground
you
will
be
looking
at
this
unseen
object
with
an
expression
of
sublime
affection
and
in
the
mirror
i
will
paint
a
vivid
brilliant
complete
reflection
minute
but
perfect
in
every
detail
of
your
scarlet
macaw
on
his
perch
we
will
call
it
because
one
must
always
give
a
silly
title
to
pictures
and
just
now
one
nondescript
word
is
the
fashion
unless
you
feel
it
needful
to
attract
to
yourself
the
eye
of
the
public
in
the
catalogue
by
calling
your
picture
twenty
lines
of
tennyson
but
when
the
portrait
goes
down
to
posterity
as
a
famous
picture
it
will
figure
in
the
catalogue
of
the
national
gallery
as
duchess
the
mirror
and
the
macaw
bravo
said
the
duchess
delighted
you
shall
paint
it
dal
in
time
for
next
year
academy
and
we
will
all
go
and
see
it
and
he
did
and
they
all
went
and
when
they
saw
it
they
said
ah
of
course
there
it
is
just
as
we
saw
it
under
the
cedar
at
overdene
here
comes
simmons
with
something
on
a
salver
exclaimed
the
duchess
how
that
man
waddles
why
ca
somebody
teach
him
to
step
out
jane
you
march
across
this
lawn
like
a
grenadier
ca
you
explain
to
simmons
how
it
done
well
what
is
it
ha
a
telegram
now
what
horrible
thing
can
have
happened
who
would
like
to
guess
i
hope
it
is
not
merely
some
idiot
who
has
missed
a
train
amid
a
breathless
and
highly
satisfactory
silence
the
duchess
tore
open
the
orange
envelope
apparently
the
shock
was
of
a
thorough
though
not
enjoyable
kind
for
the
duchess
at
all
times
highly
coloured
became
purple
as
she
read
and
absolutely
inarticulate
with
indignation
jane
rose
quietly
looked
over
her
aunt
shoulder
read
the
long
message
and
returned
to
her
seat
creature
exclaimed
the
duchess
at
last
oh
creature
this
comes
of
asking
them
as
friends
and
i
had
a
lovely
string
of
pearls
for
her
worth
far
more
than
she
would
have
been
offered
professionally
for
one
song
and
to
fail
at
the
last
minute
oh
creature
dear
aunt
said
jane
if
poor
madame
velma
has
a
sudden
attack
of
laryngitis
she
could
not
possibly
sing
a
note
even
had
the
queen
commanded
her
her
telegram
is
full
of
regrets
do
argue
jane
exclaimed
the
duchess
crossly
and
do
drag
in
the
queen
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
concert
or
velma
throat
i
do
abominate
irrelevance
and
you
know
it
why
must
she
have
her
what
do
you
call
it
just
when
she
was
coming
to
sing
here
in
my
young
days
people
never
had
these
complaints
i
have
no
patience
with
all
this
appendicitis
and
what
not
cutting
people
open
at
every
possible
excuse
in
my
young
days
we
called
it
a
good
and
gave
them
turkey
rhubarb
myra
ingleby
hid
her
face
behind
her
garden
hat
and
garth
dalmain
whispered
to
jane
i
do
abominate
irrelevance
and
you
know
it
but
jane
shook
her
head
at
him
and
refused
to
smile
tommy
wants
a
gooseberry
shouted
the
macaw
having
apparently
noticed
the
mention
of
rhubarb
oh
give
it
him
somebody
said
the
worried
duchess
dear
aunt
said
jane
there
are
no
gooseberries
do
argue
girl
cried
the
duchess
furiously
and
garth
delighted
shook
his
head
at
jane
when
he
says
he
means
anything
green
as
you
very
well
know
half
a
dozen
people
hastened
to
tommy
with
lettuce
and
cucumber
sandwiches
and
garth
picked
one
blade
of
grass
and
handed
it
to
jane
with
an
air
of
anxious
solicitude
but
jane
ignored
it
no
answer
simmons
said
the
duchess
why
do
you
go
oh
how
that
man
waddles
teach
him
to
walk
somebody
now
the
question
is
what
is
to
be
done
here
is
half
the
county
coming
to
hear
velma
by
my
invitation
and
velma
in
london
pretending
to
have
appendicitis
no
i
mean
the
other
thing
oh
the
woman
as
that
clever
bird
would
say
hold
your
jaw
shouted
tommy
the
duchess
smiled
and
consented
to
sit
down
but
dear
duchess
suggested
garth
in
his
most
soothing
voice
the
county
does
not
know
madame
velma
was
to
be
here
it
was
a
profound
secret
you
were
to
trot
her
out
at
the
end
lady
ingleby
called
her
your
packet
myra
came
out
from
behind
her
garden
hat
and
the
duchess
nodded
at
her
approvingly
quite
true
she
said
that
was
the
lovely
part
of
it
oh
creature
but
dear
duchess
pursued
garth
persuasively
if
the
county
did
not
know
the
county
will
not
be
disappointed
they
are
coming
to
listen
to
one
another
and
to
hear
themselves
and
to
enjoy
your
and
ices
all
this
they
will
do
and
go
away
delighted
saying
how
cleverly
the
dear
duchess
discovers
and
exploits
local
talent
ah
ha
said
the
duchess
with
a
gleam
in
the
hawk
eye
and
a
raising
of
the
hooked
parker
bangs
of
chicago
who
had
met
the
duchess
once
or
twice
described
as
genuine
plantagenet
but
they
will
go
away
wise
in
their
own
conceits
and
satisfied
with
their
own
mediocre
performances
my
idea
is
to
let
them
do
it
and
then
show
them
how
it
should
be
done
but
aunt
said
jane
gently
surely
you
forget
that
most
of
these
people
have
been
to
town
and
heard
plenty
of
good
music
madame
velma
herself
most
likely
and
all
the
great
singers
they
know
they
can
not
sing
like
a
prima
donna
but
they
do
their
anxious
best
because
you
ask
them
i
can
not
see
that
they
require
an
object
lesson
jane
said
the
duchess
for
the
third
time
this
afternoon
i
must
request
you
not
to
argue
miss
champion
said
garth
dalmain
if
i
were
your
grandmamma
i
should
send
you
to
bed
what
is
to
be
done
reiterated
the
duchess
she
was
to
sing
the
rosary
i
had
set
my
heart
on
it
the
whole
decoration
of
the
room
is
planned
to
suit
that
song
festoons
of
white
roses
and
a
great
at
the
back
of
the
platform
made
entirely
of
crimson
ramblers
jane
yes
aunt
oh
do
say
aunt
in
that
senseless
way
ca
you
make
some
suggestion
drat
the
woman
exclaimed
tommy
suddenly
hark
to
that
sweet
bird
cried
the
duchess
her
good
humour
fully
restored
give
him
a
strawberry
somebody
now
jane
what
do
you
suggest
jane
champion
was
seated
with
her
broad
back
half
turned
to
her
aunt
one
knee
crossed
over
the
other
her
large
capable
hands
clasped
round
it
she
loosed
her
hands
turned
slowly
round
and
looked
into
the
keen
eyes
peering
at
her
from
under
the
mushroom
hat
as
she
read
the
demand
in
them
a
slow
smile
dawned
in
her
own
she
waited
a
moment
to
make
sure
of
the
duchess
meaning
then
said
quietly
i
will
sing
the
rosary
for
you
in
velma
place
if
you
really
wish
it
aunt
had
the
gathering
under
the
tree
been
a
party
of
mere
people
it
would
have
gasped
had
it
been
a
freak
party
it
would
have
been
in
its
expressions
of
surprise
being
a
best
party
it
gave
no
outward
sign
but
a
sense
of
blank
astonishment
purely
mental
was
in
the
air
the
duchess
herself
was
the
only
person
present
who
had
heard
jane
champion
sing
have
you
the
song
asked
her
grace
of
meldrum
rising
and
picking
up
her
telegram
and
empty
basket
i
have
said
jane
i
spent
a
few
hours
with
madame
blanche
when
i
was
in
town
last
month
and
she
who
so
rarely
admires
these
modern
songs
was
immensely
taken
with
it
she
sang
it
and
allowed
me
to
accompany
her
we
spent
nearly
an
hour
over
it
i
obtained
a
copy
afterwards
good
said
the
duchess
then
i
count
on
you
now
i
must
send
a
sympathetic
telegram
to
that
poor
dear
velma
who
will
be
fretting
at
having
to
fail
us
so
revoir
good
people
remember
we
dine
punctually
at
eight
music
is
supposed
to
begin
at
nine
ronnie
be
a
kind
boy
and
carry
tommy
into
the
hall
for
me
he
will
screech
so
fearfully
if
he
sees
me
walk
away
without
him
he
is
so
very
loving
dear
bird
silence
under
the
cedar
most
people
were
watching
young
ronald
holding
the
stand
as
much
at
arm
length
as
possible
while
tommy
keeping
his
balance
wonderfully
sidled
up
close
to
him
evidently
making
confidential
remarks
into
ronnie
terrified
ear
the
duchess
walked
on
before
quite
satisfied
with
the
new
turn
events
had
taken
one
or
two
people
were
watching
jane
it
is
very
brave
of
you
said
myra
ingleby
at
length
i
would
offer
to
play
your
accompaniment
dear
but
i
can
only
manage
au
clair
de
la
lune
and
three
blind
mice
with
one
finger
and
i
would
offer
to
play
your
accompaniment
dear
said
garth
dalmain
if
you
were
going
to
sing
lassen
allerseelen
for
i
play
that
quite
beautifully
with
ten
fingers
it
is
an
education
only
to
hear
the
way
i
bring
out
the
tolling
of
the
cemetery
chapel
bell
right
through
the
song
the
poor
thing
with
the
bunch
of
purple
heather
can
never
get
away
from
it
even
in
the
grand
crescendo
appassionata
fortissimo
when
they
discover
that
death
dark
valley
this
is
holy
day
i
give
then
no
holiday
from
that
bell
i
do
know
what
it
did
in
may
it
tolls
all
the
time
with
maddening
persistence
in
my
accompaniment
but
i
have
seen
the
rosary
and
i
dare
not
face
those
chords
to
begin
with
you
start
in
every
known
flat
and
before
you
have
gone
far
you
have
gathered
unto
yourself
handfuls
of
known
and
unknown
sharps
to
which
you
cling
not
daring
to
let
them
go
lest
they
should
be
wanted
again
the
next
moment
alas
no
when
it
is
a
question
of
accompanying
the
rosary
i
must
say
as
the
old
farmer
at
the
tenants
dinner
the
other
day
said
to
the
duchess
when
she
pressed
upon
him
a
third
helping
of
pudding
i
can
not
do
be
silly
dal
said
jane
you
could
accompany
the
rosary
perfectly
if
i
wanted
it
done
but
as
it
happens
i
prefer
accompanying
myself
ah
said
lady
ingleby
sympathetically
i
quite
understand
that
it
would
be
such
a
relief
all
the
time
to
know
that
if
things
seemed
going
wrong
you
could
stop
the
other
part
and
give
yourself
the
note
the
only
two
real
musicians
present
glanced
at
each
other
and
a
gleam
of
amusement
passed
between
them
it
certainly
would
be
useful
if
necessary
said
jane
would
the
other
part
and
you
the
note
said
garth
demurely
i
am
sure
you
would
said
jane
you
are
always
so
very
kind
but
i
prefer
to
keep
the
matter
in
my
own
hands
you
realise
the
difficulty
of
making
the
voice
carry
in
a
place
of
that
size
unless
you
can
stand
and
face
the
audience
garth
dalmain
spoke
anxiously
jane
was
a
special
friend
of
his
and
he
had
a
dislike
of
the
idea
of
his
chum
failing
in
anything
publicly
the
same
quiet
smile
dawned
in
jane
eyes
and
passed
to
her
lips
as
when
she
had
realised
that
her
aunt
meant
her
to
volunteer
in
place
she
glanced
around
most
of
the
party
had
wandered
off
in
twos
and
threes
some
to
the
house
others
back
to
the
river
she
and
dal
and
myra
were
practically
alone
her
calm
eyes
were
full
of
quiet
amusement
as
she
steadfastly
met
the
anxious
look
in
garth
and
answered
his
question
yes
i
know
but
the
acoustic
properties
of
the
room
are
very
perfect
and
i
have
learned
to
throw
my
voice
perhaps
you
may
not
know
in
fact
how
should
you
know
but
i
have
had
the
immense
privilege
of
studying
with
madame
marchesi
in
paris
and
of
keeping
up
to
the
mark
since
by
an
occasional
delightful
hour
with
her
no
less
gifted
daughter
in
london
so
i
ought
to
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
the
management
of
a
voice
if
i
have
at
all
adequately
availed
myself
of
such
golden
opportunities
these
quiet
words
were
greek
to
myra
conveying
no
more
to
her
mind
than
if
jane
had
said
i
have
been
learning
tonic
in
fact
not
quite
so
much
seeing
that
lady
ingleby
had
herself
once
tried
to
master
the
tonic
system
in
order
to
instruct
her
men
and
maids
in
it
was
at
a
time
when
she
owned
a
distinctly
musical
household
the
second
footman
possessed
a
fine
barytone
the
butler
could
do
a
little
bass
which
is
to
say
that
while
the
other
parts
soared
to
higher
regions
he
could
stay
on
the
bottom
note
if
carefully
placed
there
and
told
to
remain
the
head
housemaid
sang
what
she
called
seconds
in
other
words
she
followed
along
slightly
behind
the
trebles
as
regarded
time
and
a
major
third
below
them
as
regarded
pitch
the
housekeeper
a
large
dark
person
with
a
fringe
on
her
upper
lip
unshaven
and
unashamed
produced
a
really
remarkable
effect
by
singing
the
air
an
octave
below
the
trebles
unfortunately
lady
ingleby
was
apt
to
confuse
her
with
the
butler
myra
herself
was
the
first
to
admit
that
she
had
not
much
ear
but
it
was
decidedly
trying
at
a
moment
when
she
dared
not
remove
her
eyes
from
the
accompaniment
of
good
king
wenceslas
to
have
called
out
stay
where
you
are
jenkins
and
then
find
it
was
jarvis
who
had
been
travelling
upwards
but
when
a
new
footman
engaged
by
lord
ingleby
with
no
reference
to
his
musical
gifts
chanced
to
possess
a
fine
throaty
tenor
myra
felt
she
really
had
material
with
which
great
things
might
be
accomplished
and
decided
herself
to
learn
the
tonic
system
she
easily
mastered
mi
re
do
and
so
fa
fa
mi
because
these
represented
the
opening
lines
of
three
blind
mice
always
a
musical
landmark
to
myra
but
when
it
came
to
the
intricacies
in
the
theme
of
they
all
ran
after
the
farmer
wife
lady
ingleby
was
lost
without
the
words
to
cling
to
and
gave
up
the
tonic
system
in
despair
so
the
name
of
the
greatest
teacher
of
singing
of
this
age
did
not
convey
much
to
myra
mind
but
garth
dalmain
sat
up
i
say
no
wonder
you
take
it
coolly
why
velma
herself
was
a
pupil
of
the
great
madame
that
is
how
it
happens
that
i
know
her
rather
well
said
jane
i
am
here
because
i
was
to
have
played
her
accompaniment
i
see
said
garth
and
now
you
have
to
do
both
sake
as
parker
bangs
says
when
you
explain
who
who
at
a
marlborough
house
garden
party
but
you
prefer
playing
other
accompaniments
to
singing
yourself
do
you
jane
slow
smile
dawned
again
i
prefer
singing
she
said
but
accompanying
is
more
useful
of
course
it
is
said
garth
heaps
of
people
can
sing
a
little
but
very
few
can
accompany
properly
jane
said
myra
her
grey
eyes
looking
out
lazily
from
under
their
long
black
lashes
if
you
have
had
singing
lessons
and
know
some
songs
why
has
the
duchess
turned
you
on
to
sing
to
us
before
this
for
a
sad
reason
jane
replied
you
know
her
only
son
died
eight
years
ago
he
was
such
a
handsome
talented
fellow
he
and
i
inherited
our
love
of
music
from
our
grandfather
my
cousin
got
into
a
musical
set
at
college
studied
with
enthusiasm
and
wanted
to
take
it
up
professionally
he
had
promised
one
christmas
vacation
to
sing
at
a
charity
concert
in
town
and
went
out
when
only
just
recovering
from
influenza
to
fulfil
this
engagement
he
had
a
relapse
double
pneumonia
set
in
and
he
died
in
five
days
from
heart
failure
my
poor
aunt
was
frantic
with
grief
and
since
then
any
mention
of
my
love
of
music
makes
her
very
bitter
i
too
wanted
to
take
it
up
professionally
but
she
put
her
foot
down
heavily
i
scarcely
ever
venture
to
sing
or
play
here
why
not
elsewhere
asked
garth
dalmain
we
have
stayed
about
at
the
same
houses
and
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
you
sang
i
do
not
know
said
jane
slowly
but
music
means
so
much
to
me
it
is
a
sort
of
holy
of
holies
in
the
tabernacle
of
one
inner
being
and
it
is
not
easy
to
lift
the
veil
the
veil
will
be
lifted
said
myra
ingleby
yes
agreed
jane
smiling
a
little
ruefully
i
suppose
it
will
and
we
shall
pass
in
said
garth
dalmain
chapter
v
confidences
the
shadows
silently
lengthened
on
the
lawn
the
rooks
circled
and
cawed
around
the
tall
elm
trees
the
pointed
to
six
myra
ingleby
rose
and
stood
with
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
full
in
her
eyes
her
arms
stretched
over
her
head
the
artist
noted
every
graceful
line
of
her
willowy
figure
ah
bah
she
yawned
it
is
so
perfect
out
here
and
i
must
go
in
to
my
maid
jane
be
advised
in
time
do
not
ever
begin
facial
massage
you
become
a
slave
to
it
and
it
takes
up
hours
of
your
day
look
at
me
they
were
both
looking
already
myra
was
worth
looking
at
for
ordinary
dressing
purposes
i
need
not
have
gone
in
until
seven
and
now
i
must
lose
this
last
perfect
hour
what
happens
asked
jane
i
know
nothing
of
the
process
i
ca
go
into
details
replied
lady
ingleby
but
you
know
how
sweet
i
have
looked
all
day
well
if
i
did
not
go
to
my
maid
now
i
should
look
less
sweet
by
the
end
of
dinner
and
at
the
close
of
the
evening
i
should
appear
ten
years
older
you
would
always
look
sweet
said
jane
with
frank
sincerity
and
why
mind
looking
the
age
you
are
my
dear
man
is
as
old
as
he
feels
a
woman
is
as
old
as
she
looks
quoted
myra
i
feel
just
seven
said
garth
and
you
look
seventeen
laughed
myra
and
i
am
retorted
garth
so
the
duchess
should
not
call
me
ridiculous
child
and
dear
lady
if
curtailing
this
mysterious
process
is
going
to
make
you
one
whit
less
lovely
i
do
beseech
you
to
hasten
to
your
maid
or
you
will
spoil
my
whole
evening
i
shall
burst
into
tears
at
dinner
and
the
duchess
hates
scenes
as
you
very
well
know
lady
ingleby
flapped
him
with
her
garden
hat
as
she
passed
be
quiet
you
ridiculous
child
she
said
you
had
no
business
to
listen
to
what
i
was
saying
to
jane
you
shall
paint
me
this
autumn
and
after
that
i
will
give
up
facial
massage
and
go
abroad
and
come
back
quite
old
she
flung
this
last
threat
over
her
shoulder
as
she
trailed
away
across
the
lawn
how
lovely
she
is
commented
garth
gazing
after
her
how
much
of
that
was
true
do
you
suppose
miss
champion
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
replied
jane
i
am
completely
ignorant
on
the
subject
of
facial
massage
not
much
i
should
think
continued
garth
or
she
would
not
have
told
us
ah
you
are
wrong
there
replied
jane
quickly
myra
is
extraordinarily
honest
and
always
inclined
to
be
frank
about
herself
and
her
foibles
she
had
a
curious
upbringing
she
is
one
of
a
large
family
and
was
always
considered
the
black
sheep
not
so
much
by
her
brothers
and
sisters
as
by
her
mother
nothing
she
was
or
said
or
did
was
ever
right
when
lord
ingleby
met
her
and
i
suppose
saw
her
incipient
possibilities
she
was
a
tall
gawky
girl
with
lovely
eyes
a
sweet
sensitive
mouth
and
a
expression
on
her
face
he
was
twenty
years
her
senior
but
fell
most
determinedly
in
love
with
her
and
though
her
mother
pressed
upon
him
all
her
other
daughters
in
turn
he
would
have
myra
or
nobody
when
he
proposed
to
her
it
was
impossible
at
first
to
make
her
understand
what
he
meant
his
meaning
dawned
on
her
at
length
and
he
was
not
kept
waiting
long
for
her
answer
i
have
often
heard
him
tease
her
about
it
she
looked
at
him
with
an
adorable
smile
her
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
and
said
of
course
i
marry
you
gratefully
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
sweet
of
you
to
like
me
but
what
a
blow
for
mamma
they
were
married
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
and
he
took
her
off
to
paris
italy
and
egypt
had
six
months
abroad
and
brought
her
back
this
i
was
staying
with
them
once
and
her
mother
was
also
there
we
were
sitting
in
the
morning
room
no
men
just
half
a
dozen
women
and
her
mother
began
finding
fault
about
something
and
said
not
lord
ingleby
often
told
you
of
it
myra
looked
up
in
her
sweet
lazy
way
and
answered
mamma
i
know
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
but
do
you
know
my
husband
thinks
everything
i
do
perfect
husband
is
a
fool
snapped
her
mother
your
point
of
view
dear
mamma
said
myra
sweetly
old
curmudgeon
remarked
garth
why
are
people
of
that
sort
allowed
to
be
called
we
who
have
had
tender
perfect
mothers
would
like
to
make
it
law
that
the
other
kind
should
always
be
called
or
progenitors
or
any
other
descriptive
title
but
not
profane
the
sacred
name
of
mother
jane
was
silent
she
knew
the
beautiful
story
of
garth
boyhood
with
his
widowed
mother
she
knew
his
passionate
adoration
of
her
sainted
memory
she
liked
him
best
when
she
got
a
glimpse
beneath
the
surface
and
did
not
wish
to
check
his
mood
by
reminding
him
that
she
herself
had
never
even
lisped
that
name
garth
rose
from
his
chair
and
stretched
his
slim
figure
in
the
slanting
much
as
myra
had
done
jane
looked
at
him
as
is
often
the
case
with
plain
people
great
physical
beauty
appealed
to
her
strongly
she
only
allowed
to
that
appeal
its
right
proportion
in
her
estimation
of
her
friends
garth
dalmain
by
no
means
came
first
among
her
particular
chums
he
was
older
than
most
of
them
and
yet
in
some
ways
younger
than
any
and
his
remarkable
youthfulness
of
manner
and
exuberance
of
spirits
sometimes
made
him
appear
foolish
to
jane
whose
sense
of
humour
was
of
a
more
sedate
kind
but
of
the
absolute
perfection
of
his
outward
appearance
there
was
no
question
and
jane
looked
at
him
now
much
as
his
own
mother
might
have
looked
with
honest
admiration
in
her
kind
eyes
garth
notwithstanding
the
pale
violet
shirt
and
dark
violet
tie
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
own
appearance
and
dazzled
by
the
golden
sunlight
was
also
unconscious
of
jane
look
oh
i
say
miss
champion
he
cried
boyishly
is
it
nice
that
they
have
all
gone
in
i
have
been
wanting
a
good
jaw
with
you
really
when
we
all
get
together
we
do
drivel
sometimes
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
it
is
like
patting
up
and
very
often
they
burst
and
one
realises
that
an
empty
shrivelled
little
skin
is
all
that
is
left
after
most
conversations
did
you
ever
buy
at
brighton
do
you
remember
the
wild
excitement
of
seeing
the
man
coming
along
the
parade
with
a
huge
bunch
of
them
blue
green
red
white
and
yellow
all
shining
in
the
sun
and
one
used
to
wonder
how
he
ever
contrived
to
pick
them
all
up
i
do
know
how
and
what
would
happen
if
he
put
them
all
down
i
always
knew
exactly
which
one
i
wanted
and
it
was
generally
on
a
very
inside
string
and
took
a
long
time
to
disentangle
and
how
maddening
it
was
if
the
grew
tired
of
waiting
and
walked
on
with
the
penny
only
i
would
rather
have
had
none
than
not
have
the
one
on
which
i
had
fixed
my
heart
would
you
i
never
bought
at
brighton
replied
jane
without
enthusiasm
garth
was
feeling
seven
again
and
jane
was
feeling
bored
for
once
he
seemed
conscious
of
this
he
took
his
coat
from
the
back
of
the
chair
where
he
had
hung
it
and
put
it
on
come
along
miss
champion
he
said
i
am
so
tired
of
doing
nothing
let
us
go
down
to
the
river
and
find
a
boat
or
two
dinner
is
not
until
eight
and
i
am
certain
you
can
dress
even
for
the
role
of
velma
in
half
an
hour
i
have
known
you
do
it
in
ten
minutes
at
a
pinch
there
is
ample
time
for
me
to
row
you
within
sight
of
the
minster
and
we
can
talk
as
we
go
ah
fancy
the
grey
old
minster
with
this
sunset
behind
it
and
a
field
of
cowslips
in
the
foreground
but
jane
did
not
rise
my
dear
dal
she
said
you
would
not
feel
much
enthusiasm
for
the
minster
or
the
sunset
after
you
had
pulled
my
twelve
stone
odd
up
the
river
you
would
drop
exhausted
among
the
cowslips
surely
you
might
know
by
now
that
i
am
not
the
sort
of
person
to
be
told
off
to
sit
in
the
stern
of
a
tiny
skiff
and
steer
if
i
am
in
a
boat
i
like
to
row
and
if
i
row
i
prefer
rowing
stroke
but
i
do
not
want
to
row
now
because
i
have
been
playing
golf
the
whole
afternoon
and
you
know
perfectly
well
it
would
be
no
pleasure
to
you
to
have
to
gaze
at
me
all
the
way
up
and
all
the
way
down
the
river
knowing
all
the
time
that
i
was
mentally
criticising
your
stroke
and
marking
the
careless
way
you
feathered
garth
sat
down
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
his
arms
behind
his
sleek
dark
head
and
looked
at
her
with
his
soft
shining
eyes
just
as
he
had
looked
at
the
duchess
how
cross
you
are
old
chap
he
said
gently
what
is
the
matter
jane
laughed
and
held
out
her
hand
oh
you
dear
boy
i
think
you
have
the
sweetest
temper
in
the
world
i
wo
be
cross
any
more
the
truth
is
i
hate
the
duchess
concerts
and
i
do
like
being
the
i
see
said
garth
sympathetically
but
that
being
so
why
did
you
offer
ah
i
had
to
said
jane
poor
old
dear
she
so
rarely
asks
me
anything
and
her
eyes
besought
do
you
know
how
one
longs
to
have
something
to
do
for
some
one
who
belongs
to
one
i
would
black
her
boots
if
she
wished
it
but
it
is
so
hard
to
stay
here
week
after
week
and
be
kept
at
arm
length
this
one
thing
she
asked
of
me
and
her
proud
old
eyes
pleaded
could
i
refuse
garth
was
all
sympathy
no
dear
he
said
thoughtfully
of
course
you
could
and
do
bother
over
that
silly
joke
about
the
packet
you
see
you
wo
be
that
i
have
no
doubt
you
sing
vastly
better
than
most
of
them
but
they
will
not
realise
it
it
takes
a
velma
to
make
such
people
as
these
sit
up
they
will
think
the
rosary
a
pretty
song
and
give
you
a
mild
clap
and
there
the
thing
will
end
so
do
worry
jane
sat
and
considered
this
then
dal
she
said
i
do
hate
singing
before
that
sort
of
audience
it
is
like
giving
them
your
soul
to
look
at
and
you
do
want
them
to
see
it
it
seems
indecent
to
my
mind
music
is
the
most
revealing
thing
in
the
world
i
shiver
when
i
think
of
that
song
and
yet
i
dare
do
less
than
my
best
when
the
moment
comes
i
shall
live
in
the
song
and
forget
the
audience
let
me
tell
you
a
lesson
i
once
had
from
madame
blanche
i
was
singing
chant
hindou
the
passionate
prayer
of
an
indian
woman
to
brahma
i
began
dieu
des
croyants
and
sang
it
as
i
might
have
sung
re
mi
brahma
was
nothing
to
me
cried
madame
blanche
in
her
most
imperious
manner
vous
anglais
what
are
you
doing
brahma
un
dieu
he
may
not
be
your
god
he
may
not
be
my
god
but
he
is
somebody
god
he
is
the
god
of
the
song
ecoutez
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
sang
dieu
des
croyants
maitre
des
cites
saintes
with
her
beautiful
brow
illumined
and
a
passion
of
religious
fervour
which
thrilled
one
soul
it
was
a
lesson
i
never
forgot
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
never
sung
a
song
tamely
since
fine
said
garth
dalmain
i
like
enthusiasm
in
every
branch
of
art
i
never
care
to
paint
a
portrait
unless
i
adore
the
woman
i
am
painting
jane
smiled
the
conversation
was
turning
exactly
the
way
she
had
hoped
eventually
to
lead
it
dal
dear
she
said
you
adore
so
many
in
turn
that
we
old
friends
who
have
your
real
interest
at
heart
fear
you
will
never
adore
to
any
definite
purpose
garth
laughed
oh
bother
he
said
are
you
like
all
the
rest
do
you
also
think
adoration
and
admiration
must
necessarily
mean
marriage
i
should
have
expected
you
to
take
a
saner
and
more
masculine
view
my
dear
boy
said
jane
your
friends
have
decided
that
you
need
a
wife
you
are
alone
in
the
world
you
have
a
lovely
home
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoiled
by
all
the
silly
women
who
run
after
you
of
course
we
are
perfectly
aware
that
your
wife
must
have
every
incomparable
beauty
under
the
sun
united
in
her
own
exquisite
person
but
each
new
divinity
you
see
and
paint
apparently
fulfils
for
the
time
being
this
wondrous
ideal
and
perhaps
if
you
wedded
one
instead
of
painting
her
she
might
continue
permanently
to
fulfil
it
garth
considered
this
in
silence
his
level
brows
knitted
at
last
he
said
beauty
is
so
much
a
thing
of
the
surface
i
see
it
and
admire
it
i
desire
it
and
paint
it
when
i
have
painted
it
i
have
made
it
my
own
and
somehow
i
find
i
have
done
with
it
all
the
time
i
am
painting
a
woman
i
am
seeking
for
her
soul
i
want
to
express
it
on
my
canvas
and
do
you
know
miss
champion
i
find
that
a
lovely
woman
does
not
always
have
a
lovely
soul
jane
was
silent
the
last
things
she
wished
to
discuss
were
other
women
souls
there
is
just
one
who
seems
to
me
perfect
continued
garth
i
am
to
paint
her
this
autumn
i
believe
i
shall
find
her
soul
as
exquisite
as
her
body
and
she
is
inquired
jane
lady
brand
flower
exclaimed
jane
are
you
so
taken
with
flower
ah
she
is
lovely
said
garth
with
reverent
enthusiasm
it
positively
is
not
right
for
any
one
to
be
so
absolutely
flawlessly
lovely
it
makes
me
ache
do
you
know
that
feeling
miss
champion
of
perfect
loveliness
making
you
ache
no
i
do
said
jane
shortly
and
i
do
not
think
other
wives
ought
to
have
that
effect
upon
you
my
dear
old
chap
exclaimed
garth
astonished
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
wives
or
no
wives
a
wood
of
bluebells
in
morning
sunshine
would
have
precisely
the
same
effect
i
ache
to
paint
her
when
i
have
painted
her
and
really
done
justice
to
that
matchless
loveliness
as
i
see
it
i
shall
feel
all
right
at
present
i
have
only
painted
her
from
memory
but
she
is
to
sit
to
me
in
october
from
memory
questioned
jane
yes
i
paint
a
great
deal
from
memory
give
me
one
look
of
a
certain
kind
at
a
face
let
me
see
it
at
a
moment
which
lets
one
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
and
i
can
paint
that
face
from
memory
weeks
after
lots
of
my
best
studies
have
been
done
that
way
ah
the
delight
of
it
beauty
the
worship
of
beauty
is
to
me
a
religion
rather
a
godless
form
of
religion
suggested
jane
ah
no
said
garth
reverently
all
true
beauty
comes
from
god
and
leads
back
to
god
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
i
once
met
an
old
freak
who
said
all
sickness
came
from
the
devil
i
never
could
believe
that
for
my
mother
was
an
invalid
during
the
last
years
of
her
life
and
i
can
testify
that
her
sickness
was
a
blessing
to
many
and
borne
to
the
glory
of
god
but
i
am
convinced
all
true
beauty
is
and
that
is
why
the
worship
of
beauty
is
to
me
a
religion
nothing
bad
was
ever
truly
beautiful
nothing
good
is
ever
really
ugly
jane
smiled
as
she
watched
him
lying
back
in
the
golden
sunlight
the
very
personification
of
manly
beauty
the
absolute
lack
of
either
for
himself
or
for
her
which
allowed
him
to
talk
thus
to
the
plainest
woman
of
his
acquaintance
held
a
vein
of
humour
which
diverted
jane
it
appealed
to
her
more
than
buying
coloured
or
screaming
because
the
duchess
wore
a
mushroom
hat
then
are
plain
people
to
be
denied
their
share
of
goodness
dal
she
asked
plainness
is
not
ugliness
replied
garth
dalmain
simply
i
learned
that
when
quite
a
small
boy
my
mother
took
me
to
hear
a
famous
preacher
as
he
sat
on
the
platform
during
the
preliminaries
he
seemed
to
me
quite
the
ugliest
man
i
had
ever
seen
he
reminded
me
of
a
grotesque
gorilla
and
i
dreaded
the
moment
when
he
should
rise
up
and
face
us
and
give
out
a
text
it
seemed
to
me
there
ought
to
be
bars
between
and
that
we
should
want
to
throw
nuts
and
oranges
but
when
he
rose
to
speak
his
face
was
transfigured
goodness
and
inspiration
shone
from
it
making
it
as
the
face
of
an
angel
i
never
again
thought
him
ugly
the
beauty
of
his
soul
shone
through
transfiguring
his
body
child
though
i
was
i
could
differentiate
even
then
between
ugliness
and
plainness
when
he
sat
down
at
the
close
of
his
magnificent
sermon
i
no
longer
thought
him
a
complicated
form
of
chimpanzee
i
remembered
the
divine
halo
of
his
smile
of
course
his
actual
plainness
of
feature
remained
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
could
have
wanted
to
live
with
or
to
have
day
after
day
opposite
to
one
at
table
but
then
one
was
not
called
to
that
sort
of
discipline
which
would
have
been
martyrdom
to
me
and
he
has
always
stood
to
my
mind
since
as
a
proof
of
the
truth
that
goodness
is
never
ugly
and
that
divine
love
and
aspiration
shining
through
the
plainest
features
may
redeem
them
temporarily
into
beauty
and
permanently
into
a
thing
one
loves
to
remember
i
see
said
jane
it
must
have
often
helped
you
to
a
right
view
to
have
realised
that
so
long
ago
but
now
let
us
return
to
the
important
question
of
the
face
which
you
are
to
have
daily
opposite
you
at
table
it
can
not
be
lady
brand
nor
can
it
be
myra
but
you
know
dal
a
very
lovely
one
is
being
suggested
for
the
position
no
names
please
said
garth
quickly
i
object
to
girls
names
being
mentioned
in
this
sort
of
conversation
very
well
dear
boy
i
understand
and
respect
your
objection
you
have
made
her
famous
already
by
your
impressionist
portrait
of
her
and
i
hear
you
are
to
do
a
more
elaborate
picture
the
fall
now
dal
you
know
you
admire
her
immensely
she
is
lovely
she
is
charming
she
hails
from
the
land
whose
women
when
they
possess
charm
unite
with
it
a
freshness
and
a
piquancy
which
place
them
beyond
compare
in
some
ways
you
are
so
unique
yourself
that
you
ought
to
have
a
wife
with
a
certain
amount
of
originality
now
i
hardly
know
how
far
the
opinion
of
your
friends
would
influence
you
in
such
a
matter
but
you
may
like
to
hear
how
fully
they
approve
your
very
open
allegiance
to
shall
we
say
the
beautiful
and
stripes
garth
dalmain
took
out
his
cigarette
case
carefully
selected
a
cigarette
and
sat
with
it
between
his
fingers
in
absorbed
contemplation
smoke
said
jane
thanks
said
garth
he
struck
a
match
and
very
deliberately
lighted
his
cigarette
as
he
flung
away
the
vesta
the
breeze
caught
it
and
it
fell
on
the
lawn
flaming
brightly
garth
sprang
up
and
extinguished
it
then
drew
his
chair
more
exactly
opposite
to
jane
and
lay
back
smoking
meditatively
and
watching
the
little
rings
he
blew
mount
into
the
cedar
branches
expand
fade
and
vanish
jane
was
watching
him
the
varied
and
characteristic
ways
in
which
her
friends
lighted
and
smoked
their
cigarettes
always
interested
jane
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
young
men
of
whom
she
could
have
given
the
names
upon
hearing
a
description
of
their
method
also
she
had
learned
from
deryck
brand
the
value
of
silences
in
an
important
conversation
and
the
art
of
not
weakening
a
statement
by
a
postscript
at
last
garth
spoke
i
wonder
why
the
smoke
is
that
lovely
pale
blue
as
it
curls
up
from
the
cigarette
and
a
if
one
blows
it
out
jane
knew
it
was
because
it
had
become
impregnated
with
moisture
but
she
did
not
say
so
having
no
desire
to
contribute
her
quota
of
pats
to
this
or
to
encourage
the
superficial
workings
of
his
mind
just
then
she
quietly
awaited
the
response
to
her
appeal
to
his
deeper
nature
which
she
felt
certain
would
be
forthcoming
presently
it
came
it
is
awfully
good
of
you
miss
champion
to
take
the
trouble
to
think
all
this
and
to
say
it
to
me
may
i
prove
my
gratitude
by
explaining
for
once
where
my
difficulty
lies
i
have
scarcely
defined
it
to
myself
and
yet
i
believe
i
can
express
it
to
you
another
long
silence
garth
smoked
and
pondered
jane
waited
it
was
a
very
comprehending
very
companionable
silence
garth
found
himself
parodying
the
last
lines
of
an
old
song
then
ever
pray
that
heaven
may
send
such
weeds
such
chairs
and
such
a
friend
either
the
cigarette
or
the
chair
or
jane
or
perhaps
all
three
combined
were
producing
in
him
a
sublime
sense
of
calm
and
rest
and
an
uplifting
of
spirit
which
made
all
good
things
seem
better
all
difficult
things
easy
and
all
ideals
possible
the
silence
like
the
sunset
was
golden
but
at
last
he
broke
it
two
women
the
only
two
women
who
have
ever
really
been
in
my
life
form
for
me
a
standard
below
which
i
can
not
fall
one
my
mother
a
sacred
and
ideal
memory
the
other
old
margery
graem
my
childhood
friend
and
nurse
now
my
housekeeper
and
general
tender
and
mender
her
faithful
heart
and
constant
remembrance
help
to
keep
me
true
to
the
ideal
of
that
sweet
presence
which
faded
from
beside
me
when
i
stood
on
the
threshold
of
manhood
margery
lives
at
castle
gleneesh
when
i
return
home
the
sight
which
first
meets
my
eyes
as
the
hall
door
opens
is
old
margery
in
her
black
satin
apron
lawn
kerchief
and
lavender
ribbons
i
always
feel
seven
then
and
i
always
hug
her
you
miss
champion
do
like
me
when
i
feel
seven
but
margery
does
now
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
realise
when
i
bring
a
bride
to
gleneesh
and
present
her
to
margery
the
kind
old
eyes
will
try
to
see
nothing
but
good
the
faithful
old
heart
will
yearn
to
love
and
serve
and
yet
i
shall
know
she
knows
the
standard
just
as
i
know
it
i
shall
know
she
remembers
the
ideal
of
gentle
tender
christian
womanhood
just
as
i
remember
it
and
i
must
not
i
dare
not
fall
short
believe
me
miss
champion
more
than
once
when
physical
attraction
has
been
strong
and
i
have
been
tempted
in
the
worship
of
the
outward
loveliness
to
disregard
or
forget
the
essentials
the
things
which
are
unseen
but
eternal
then
all
unconscious
of
exercising
any
such
influence
old
margery
clear
eyes
look
into
mine
old
margery
mittened
hand
seems
to
rest
upon
my
coat
sleeve
and
the
voice
which
has
guided
me
from
infancy
says
in
gentle
astonishment
this
your
choice
master
garthie
to
fill
my
dear
lady
place
no
doubt
miss
champion
it
will
seem
almost
absurd
to
you
when
you
think
of
our
set
and
our
sentiments
and
the
way
we
racket
round
that
i
should
sit
here
on
the
duchess
lawn
and
confess
that
i
have
been
held
back
from
proposing
marriage
to
the
women
i
have
most
admired
because
of
what
would
have
been
my
old
nurse
opinion
of
them
but
you
must
remember
her
opinion
is
formed
by
a
memory
and
that
memory
is
the
memory
of
my
dead
mother
moreover
margery
voices
my
best
self
and
expresses
my
own
judgment
when
it
is
not
blinded
by
passion
or
warped
by
my
worship
of
the
beautiful
not
that
margery
would
disapprove
of
loveliness
in
fact
she
would
approve
of
nothing
else
for
me
i
know
very
well
but
her
penetration
rapidly
goes
beneath
the
surface
according
to
one
of
paul
sublime
paradoxes
she
looks
at
the
things
that
are
not
seen
it
seems
queer
that
i
can
tell
you
all
this
miss
champion
and
really
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
actually
formulated
it
in
my
own
mind
but
i
think
it
so
extremely
friendly
of
you
to
have
troubled
to
give
me
good
advice
in
the
matter
garth
dalmain
ceased
speaking
and
the
silence
which
followed
suddenly
assumed
alarming
proportions
seeming
to
jane
like
a
high
fence
which
she
was
vainly
trying
to
scale
she
found
herself
mentally
rushing
hither
and
thither
seeking
a
gate
or
any
possible
means
of
egress
and
still
she
was
confronted
by
the
difficulty
of
replying
adequately
to
the
totally
unexpected
and
what
added
to
her
dumbness
was
the
fact
that
she
was
infinitely
touched
by
garth
confession
and
when
jane
was
deeply
moved
speech
always
became
difficult
that
this
young
man
adored
by
all
the
girls
for
his
good
looks
and
delightful
manners
pursued
for
his
extreme
eligibility
by
mothers
and
chaperons
famous
already
in
the
world
of
art
flattered
courted
sought
after
in
society
should
calmly
admit
that
the
only
woman
really
left
in
his
life
was
his
old
nurse
and
that
her
opinion
and
expectations
held
him
back
from
a
worldly
or
unwise
marriage
touched
jane
deeply
even
while
in
her
heart
she
smiled
at
what
their
set
would
say
could
they
realise
the
situation
it
revealed
garth
in
a
new
light
and
suddenly
jane
understood
him
as
she
had
not
understood
him
before
and
yet
the
only
reply
she
could
bring
herself
to
frame
was
i
wish
i
knew
old
margery
garth
brown
eyes
flashed
with
pleasure
ah
i
wish
you
did
he
said
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
castle
gleneesh
you
would
enjoy
the
view
from
the
terrace
sheer
into
the
gorge
and
away
across
the
purple
hills
and
i
think
you
would
like
the
pine
woods
and
the
moor
i
say
miss
champion
why
should
not
get
up
a
party
in
september
and
implore
the
duchess
to
come
and
chaperon
it
and
then
you
could
come
and
any
one
else
you
would
like
asked
and
and
perhaps
we
might
ask
the
beautiful
and
stripes
and
her
aunt
parker
bangs
of
chicago
and
then
we
should
see
what
margery
thought
of
her
delightful
said
jane
i
would
come
with
pleasure
and
really
dal
i
think
that
girl
has
a
sweet
nature
could
you
do
better
the
exterior
is
perfect
and
surely
the
soul
is
there
yes
ask
us
all
and
see
what
happens
i
will
cried
garth
delighted
and
what
will
margery
think
of
parker
bangs
never
mind
said
jane
decidedly
when
you
marry
the
niece
the
aunt
goes
back
to
chicago
and
i
wish
her
people
were
not
millionaires
that
ca
be
helped
said
jane
americans
are
so
charming
that
we
really
must
not
mind
their
money
i
wish
miss
lister
and
her
aunt
were
here
remarked
garth
but
they
are
to
be
at
lady
ingleby
where
i
am
due
next
tuesday

on
there

jane

a
harmonious
couple
yes
said
garth
but
no
one
could
help
being
a
harmonious
couple
who
had
married
lady
ingleby
what
grammar
laughed
jane
but
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
am
glad
you
think
so
highly
of
myra
she
is
a
dear
only

haste
and

her
and
get
her
off
your
mind
so
as
to
be
free
for
pauline
lister
the
pointed
to
seven
the
rooks
had
circled
round
the
elms
and
dropped
contentedly
into
their
nests
let
us
go
in
said
jane
rising
i
am
glad
we
have
had
this
talk
she
added
as
he
walked
beside
her
across
the
lawn
yes
said
garth
were
in
it
it
was
a
football
this
time
good
solid
leather
and
we
each
kicked
one
goal
a
tie
you
know
for
your
advice
went
home
to
me
and
i
think
my
reply
showed
you
the
true
lie
of
things
eh
miss
champion
he
was
feeling
seven
again
but
jane
saw
him
now
through
old
glasses
and
it
did
not
annoy
her
yes
she
said
smiling
at
him
with
her
kind
true
eyes
we
will
consider
it
a
tie
and
surely
it
will
prove
a
tie
to
our
friendship
thank
you
dal
for
all
you
have
told
me
arrived
in
her
room
jane
found
she
had
half
an
hour
to
spare
before
dressing
she
took
out
her
diary
her
conversation
with
garth
dalmain
seemed
worth
recording
particularly
his
story
of
the
preacher
whose
beauty
of
soul
redeemed
the
ugliness
of
his
body
she
wrote
it
down
verbatim
then
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
dressed
for
dinner
and
the
concert
which

garth
dalmain
as
master
of
ceremonies
had
sought
jane
champion
on
the
terrace
and
stood
before
her
in
the
soft
light
of
the
hanging
chinese
lanterns
the
crimson
rambler
in
his
and
his
red
silk
socks
which
matched
it
lent
an
artistic
touch
of
colour
to
the
conventional
black
and
white
of
his
evening
clothes
jane
looked
up
from
the
comfortable
depths
of
her
wicker
chair
then
smiled
at
his
anxious
face
i
am
ready
she
said
and
rising
walked
beside
him
has
it
gone
well
she
asked
is
it
a
good
audience
packed
replied
garth
and
the
duchess
has
enjoyed
herself
it
has
been
funnier
than
usual
but
now
comes
the
event
of
the
evening
i
say
where
is
your
score
thanks
said
jane
i
shall
play
it
from
memory
it
obviates
the
bother
of
turning
over
they
passed
into
the
and
stood
behind
screens
and
a
curtain
close
to
the
steps
leading
from
the
side
up
on
to
the
platform
oh
hark
to
the
duchess
whispered
garth
my
niece
jane
champion
has
kindly
consented
to
step
into
the
breach
which
means
that
you
will
have
to
step
up
on
to
that
platform
in
another
really
it
would
be
kinder
to
you
if
she
said
less
about
velma
but
never
mind
they
are
prepared
to
like
anything
there
appendicitis
i
told
you
so
poor
madame
velma
let
us
hope
it
wo
get
into
the
local
papers
oh
goodness
she
is
going
to
enlarge
on
diseases
well
it
gives
us
a
moment
breathing
space
i
say
miss
champion
i
was
chaffing
this
afternoon
about
sharps
and
flats
i
can
play
that
accompaniment
for
you
if
you
like
no
well
just
as
you
think
best
but
remember
it
takes
a
lot
of
voice
to
make
much
effect
in
this
and
the
place
is
crowded
now
the
duchess
has
done
come
on
mind
the
bottom
step
hang
it
all
how
dark
it
is
behind
this
curtain
garth
gave
her
his
hand
and
jane
mounted
the
steps
and
passed
into
view
of
the
large
audience
assembled
in
the
overdene
her
tall
figure
seemed
taller
than
usual
as
she
walked
alone
across
the
rather
high
platform
she
wore
a
black
evening
gown
of
soft
material
with
old
lace
at
her
bosom
and
one
string
of
pearls
round
her
neck
when
she
appeared
the
audience
gazed
at
her
and
applauded
doubtfully
velma
name
on
the
programme
had
raised
great
expectations
and
here
was
miss
champion
who
certainly
played
very
nicely
but
was
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
sing
volunteering
to
sing
velma
song
a
more
kindly
audience
would
have
cheered
her
to
the
echo
voicing
its
generous
appreciation
of
her
effort
and
sanguine
expectation
of
her
success
this
audience
expressed
its
astonishment
in
the
dubiousness
of
its
faint
applause
jane
smiled
at
them
sat
down
at
the
piano
a
bechstein
grand
glanced
at
the
festoons
of
white
roses
and
the
cross
of
crimson
ramblers
then
without
further
preliminaries
struck
the
opening
chord
and
commenced
to
sing
the
deep
perfect
voice
thrilled
through
the
room
a
sudden
breathless
hush
fell
upon
the
audience
each
syllable
penetrated
the
silence
borne
on
a
tone
so
tender
and
so
amazingly
sweet
that
casual
hearts
stood
still
and
marvelled
at
their
own
emotion
and
those
who
felt
deeply
already
responded
with
a
yet
deeper
thrill
to
the
magic
of
that
music
the
hours
i
spent
with
thee
dear
heart
are
as
a
string
of
pearls
to
me
i
count
them
over
one
apart
my
rosary
my
rosary
softly
thoughtfully
tenderly
the
last
two
words
were
breathed
into
the
silence
holding
a
world
of
reminiscence
a
faithful
remembrance
of
tender
moments
in
the
past
the
listening
crowd
held
its
breath
this
was
not
a
song
this
was
the
throbbing
of
a
heart
and
it
throbbed
in
tones
of
such
sweetness
that
tears
started
unbidden
then
the
voice
which
had
rendered
the
opening
lines
so
quietly
rose
in
a
rapid
crescendo
of
quivering
pain
each
hour
a
pearl
each
pearl
a
prayer
to
still
a
heart
in
absence
wrung
i
tell
each
bead
unto
the
end
and
there
a
cross
is
hung
the
last
four
words
were
given
with
a
sudden
power
and
passion
which
electrified
the
assembly
in
the
pause
which
followed
could
be
heard
the
tension
of
feeling
produced
but
in
another
moment
the
quiet
voice
fell
soothingly
expressing
a
strength
of
endurance
which
would
fail
in
no
crisis
nor
fear
to
face
any
depths
of
pain
yet
gathering
to
itself
a
poignancy
of
sweetness
rendered
richer
by
the
discipline
of
suffering
o
memories
that
bless
and
burn
o
barren
gain
and
bitter
loss
i
kiss
each
bead
and
strive
at
last
to
learn
to
kiss
the
cross
to
kiss
the
cross
only
those
who
have
heard
jane
sing
the
rosary
can
possibly
realise
how
she
sang
i
kiss
each
bead
the
lingering
retrospection
in
each
word
breathed
out
a
love
so
womanly
so
beautiful
so
tender
that
her
identity
was
forgotten
even
by
those
in
the
audience
who
knew
her
best
in
the
magic
of
her
rendering
of
the
song
the
accompaniment
which
opens
with
a
single
chord
closes
with
a
single
note
jane
struck
it
softly
lingeringly
then
rose
turned
from
the
piano
and
was
leaving
the
platform
when
a
sudden
burst
of
wild
applause
broke
from
the
audience
jane
hesitated
paused
looked
at
her
guests
as
if
almost
surprised
to
find
them
there
then
the
slow
smile
dawned
in
her
eyes
and
passed
to
her
lips
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
platform
for
a
moment
awkwardly
almost
shyly
then
moved
on
as
men
voices
began
to
shout
encore
and
left
the
platform
by
the
side
staircase
but
there
behind
the
scenes
in
the
of
screens
and
curtains
a
fresh
surprise
awaited
jane
more
startling
than
the
enthusiastic
tumult
of
her
audience
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
stood
garth
dalmain
his
face
was
absolutely
colourless
and
his
eyes
shone
out
from
it
like
burning
stars
he
remained
motionless
until
she
stepped
from
the
last
stair
and
stood
close
to
him
then
with
a
sudden
movement
he
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
her
round
go
back
he
said
and
the
overmastering
need
quivering
in
his
voice
drew
jane
eyes
to
his
in
mute
astonishment
go
back
at
once
and
sing
it
all
over
again
note
for
note
word
for
word
just
as
before
ah
do
stand
here
waiting
go
back
now
go
back
at
once
do
you
know
that
you
must
jane
looked
into
those
shining
eyes
something
she
saw
in
them
excused
the
brusque
command
of
his
tone
without
a
word
she
quietly
mounted
the
steps
and
walked
across
the
platform
to
the
piano
people
were
still
applauding
and
redoubled
their
demonstrations
of
delight
as
she
appeared
but
jane
took
her
seat
at
the
instrument
without
giving
them
a
thought
she
was
experiencing
a
very
curious
and
unusual
sensation
never
before
in
her
whole
life
had
she
obeyed
a
peremptory
command
in
her
childhood
days
fraulein
and
miss
jebb
soon
found
out
that
they
could
only
obtain
their
desires
by
means
of
carefully
worded
requests
or
pathetic
appeals
to
her
good
feelings
and
sense
of
right
an
unreasonable
order
or
a
reasonable
one
unexplained
promptly
met
with
a
refusal
and
this
characteristic
still
obtained
though
modified
by
time
and
even
the
duchess
as
a
rule
said
please
to
jane
but
now
a
young
man
with
a
white
face
and
blazing
eyes
had
unceremoniously
swung
her
round
ordered
her
up
the
stairs
and
commanded
her
to
sing
a
song
over
again
note
for
note
word
for
word
and
she
was
meekly
going
to
obey
as
she
took
her
seat
jane
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
not
to
sing
the
rosary
again
she
had
many
finer
songs
in
her
repertoire
the
audience
expected
another
why
should
she
disappoint
those
expectations
because
of
the
imperious
demands
of
a
very
highly
excited
boy
she
commenced
the
magnificent
prelude
to
handel
you
walk
but
as
she
played
it
her
sense
of
truth
and
justice
intervened
she
had
not
come
back
to
sing
again
at
the
bidding
of
a
highly
excited
boy
but
of
a
deeply
moved
man
and
his
emotion
was
of
no
ordinary
kind
that
garth
dalmain
should
have
been
so
moved
as
to
forget
even
momentarily
his
punctilious
courtesy
of
manner
was
the
highest
possible
tribute
to
her
art
and
to
her
song
while
she
played
the
handel
theme
and
played
it
so
that
a
whole
orchestra
seemed
marshalled
upon
the
under
those
strong
firm
finger
she
suddenly
realised
though
scarcely
understanding
it
the
must
of
which
garth
had
spoken
and
made
up
her
mind
to
yield
to
its
necessity
so
when
the
opening
bars
were
ended
instead
of
singing
the
grand
song
from
semele
she
paused
for
a
moment
struck
once
more
the
rosary
opening
chord
and
did
as
garth
had
bidden
her
to
do
the
hours
i
spent
with
thee
dear
heart
are
as
a
string
of
pearls
to
me
i
count
them
over
one
apart
my
rosary
my
rosary
each
hour
a
pearl
each
pearl
a
prayer
to
still
a
heart
in
absence
wrung
i
tell
each
bead
unto
the
end
and
there
a
cross
is
hung
o
memories
that
bless
and
burn
o
barren
gain
and
bitter
loss
i
kiss
each
bead
and
strive
at
last
to
learn
to
kiss
the
cross
to
kiss
the
cross
when
jane
left
the
platform
garth
was
still
standing
motionless
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
his
face
was
just
as
white
as
before
but
his
eyes
had
lost
that
terrible
look
of
unshed
tears
which
had
sent
her
back
at
his
bidding
without
a
word
of
question
or
remonstrance
a
wonderful
light
now
shone
in
them
a
light
of
adoration
which
touched
heart
because
she
had
never
before
seen
anything
quite
like
it
she
smiled
as
she
came
slowly
down
the
steps
and
held
out
both
hands
to
him
with
an
unconscious
movement
of
gracious
friendliness
garth
stepped
close
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
took
them
in
his
while
she
was
still
on
the
step
above
him
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
then
in
a
low
voice
vibrant
with
emotion
my
god
he
said
oh
my
god
hush
said
jane
i
never
like
to
hear
that
name
spoken
lightly
dal
spoken
lightly
he
exclaimed
no
speaking
lightly
would
be
possible
for
me
perfect
gift
is
from
above
when
words
fail
me
to
speak
of
the
gift
can
you
wonder
if
i
apostrophise
the
giver
jane
looked
steadily
into
his
shining
eyes
and
a
smile
of
pleasure
illumined
her
own
so
you
liked
my
song
she
said
liked
liked
your
song
repeated
garth
a
shade
of
perplexity
crossing
his
face
i
do
not
know
whether
i
liked
your
song
then
why
this
flattering
demonstration
inquired
jane
laughing
because
said
garth
very
low
you
lifted
the
veil
and
i
i
passed
within
he
was
still
holding
her
hands
in
his
and
as
he
spoke
the
last
two
words
he
turned
them
gently
over
and
bending
kissed
each
palm
with
an
indescribably
tender
reverence
then
loosing
them
stood
on
one
side
and
jane
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
alone
chapter
vii
garth
finds
his
rosary
jane
spent
but
a
very
few
minutes
in
the
that
evening
the
fun
in
progress
there
was
not
to
her
taste
and
the
praises
heaped
upon
herself
annoyed
her
also
she
wanted
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
in
order
to
think
over
that
closing
episode
of
the
concert
which
had
taken
place
between
herself
and
garth
behind
the
scenes
she
did
not
feel
certain
how
to
take
it
she
was
conscious
that
it
held
an
element
which
she
could
not
fathom
and
garth
last
act
had
awakened
in
herself
feelings
which
she
did
not
understand
she
extremely
disliked
the
way
in
which
he
had
kissed
her
hands
and
yet
he
had
put
into
the
action
such
a
passion
of
reverent
worship
that
it
gave
her
a
sense
of
consecration
of
being
as
it
were
set
apart
to
minister
always
to
the
hearts
of
men
in
that
perfect
gift
of
melody
which
should
uplift
and
ennoble
she
could
not
lose
the
sensation
of
the
impress
of
his
lips
upon
the
palms
of
her
hands
it
was
as
if
he
had
left
behind
something
tangible
and
abiding
she
caught
herself
looking
at
them
anxiously
once
or
twice
and
the
third
time
this
happened
she
determined
to
go
to
her
room
the
duchess
was
at
the
piano
completely
hidden
from
view
by
nearly
the
whole
of
her
house
party
crowding
round
in
fits
of
delighted
laughter
ronnie
had
just
broken
through
from
the
inmost
circle
to
fetch
an
antimacassar
and
billy
to
dash
to
the
for
a
sheet
of
jane
knew
the
meant
a
clerical
dog
collar
and
she
concluded
something
had
been
worn
which
resembled
an
antimacassar
she
turned
rather
wearily
and
moved
towards
the
door
quiet
and
unobserved
though
her
retreat
had
been
garth
was
at
the
door
before
her
she
did
not
know
how
he
got
there
for
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
she
had
seen
his
sleek
head
close
to
myra
ingleby
on
the
further
side
of
the
duchess
crowd
he
opened
the
door
and
jane
passed
out
she
felt
equally
desirous
of
saying
two
things
to
him
either
how
dared
you
behave
in
so
unconventional
a
way
or
tell
me
just
what
you
want
me
to
do
and
i
will
do
it
she
said
neither
garth
followed
her
into
the
hall
lighted
a
candle
and
threw
the
match
at
tommy
then
handed
her
the
silver
candlestick
he
was
looking
absurdly
happy
jane
felt
annoyed
with
him
for
parading
this
gladness
which
she
had
unwittingly
caused
and
in
which
she
had
no
share
also
she
felt
she
must
break
this
intimate
silence
it
was
saying
so
much
which
ought
not
to
be
said
since
it
could
not
be
spoken
she
took
her
candle
rather
aggressively
and
turned
upon
the
second
step
dal
she
said
and
do
you
know
that
you
are
missing
the
curate
he
looked
up
at
her
his
eyes
shone
in
the
light
of
her
candle
no
he
said
i
am
neither
missing
nor
missed
i
was
only
waiting
in
there
until
you
went
up
i
shall
not
go
back
i
am
going
out
into
the
park
now
to
breathe
in
the
refreshing
coolness
of
the
night
breeze
and
i
am
going
to
stand
under
the
oaks
and
tell
my
beads
i
did
not
know
i
had
a
rosary
until
but
i
have
i
have
i
should
say
you
have
a
dozen
remarked
jane
dryly
then
you
would
be
wrong
replied
garth
i
have
just
one
but
it
has
many
hours
i
shall
be
able
to
call
them
all
to
mind
when
i
get
out
there
alone
i
am
going
to
each
pearl
how
about
the
cross
asked
jane
i
have
not
reached
that
yet
answered
garth
there
is
no
cross
to
my
rosary
i
fear
there
is
a
cross
to
every
true
rosary
dal
said
jane
gently
and
i
also
fear
it
will
go
hard
with
you
when
you
find
yours
but
garth
was
confident
and
unafraid
when
i
find
mine
he
said
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
involuntarily
jane
looked
at
her
hands
he
saw
the
look
and
smiled
though
he
had
the
grace
to
colour
beneath
his
tan
to
face
the
cross
he
said
jane
turned
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
but
garth
arrested
her
with
an
eager
question
just
one
moment
miss
champion
there
is
something
i
want
to
ask
you
may
i
will
you
think
me
impertinent
presuming
inquisitive
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
said
jane
but
i
am
thinking
you
all
sorts
of
unusual
things
so
three
adjectives
more
or
less
will
not
matter
much
you
may
ask
miss
champion
have
you
a
rosary
jane
looked
at
him
blankly
then
suddenly
understood
the
drift
of
his
question
my
dear
boy
no
she
said
thank
goodness
i
have
kept
clear
of
that
bless
and
burn
none
of
these
things
enter
into
my
rational
and
life
and
i
have
no
wish
that
they
should
then
deliberated
garth
how
came
you
to
sing
the
rosary
as
if
each
line
were
your
own
experience
each
joy
or
pain
a
thing
long
passed
perhaps
but
your
own
because
explained
jane
i
always
live
in
a
song
when
i
sing
it
did
i
not
tell
you
the
lesson
i
learned
over
the
chant
hindou
therefore
i
had
a
rosary
undoubtedly
when
i
was
singing
that
song
but
apart
from
that
in
the
sense
you
mean
no
thank
goodness
i
have
none
garth
mounted
two
steps
bringing
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
candlestick
but
if
you
cared
he
said
speaking
very
low
that
is
how
you
would
care
that
is
as
you
would
feel
jane
considered
yes
she
said
if
i
cared
i
suppose
i
should
care
just
so
and
feel
as
i
felt
during
those
few
minutes
then
it
was
you
in
the
song
although
the
circumstances
are
not
yours
yes
i
suppose
so
jane
replied
if
we
can
consider
ourselves
apart
from
our
circumstances
but
surely
this
is
rather
an
unprofitable
goodnight
garthie
i
say
miss
champion
just
one
thing
more
will
you
sing
for
me
will
you
come
to
the
and
sing
all
the
lovely
things
i
want
to
hear
and
will
you
let
me
play
a
few
of
your
accompaniments
ah
promise
you
will
come
and
promise
to
sing
whatever
i
ask
and
i
wo
bother
you
any
more
now
he
stood
looking
up
at
her
waiting
for
her
promise
with
such
adoration
shining
in
his
eyes
that
jane
was
startled
and
more
than
a
little
troubled
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
found
the
key
and
she
hastened
to
explain
it
to
herself
and
to
him
oh
you
dear
boy
she
said
what
an
artist
you
are
and
how
difficult
it
is
for
us
commonplace
people
to
understand
the
artistic
temperament
here
you
go
almost
turning
my
steady
old
head
by
your
rapture
over
what
seemed
to
you
perfection
of
sound
which
has
reached
you
through
the
ear
just
as
again
and
again
you
worship
at
the
shrine
of
perfection
of
form
which
reaches
you
through
the
eye
i
begin
to
understand
how
it
is
you
turn
the
heads
of
women
when
you
paint
them
however
you
are
very
delightful
in
your
delight
and
i
want
to
go
up
to
bed
so
i
promise
to
sing
all
you
want
and
as
much
as
you
wish
now
keep
your
promise
and
do
bother
me
any
more
do
spend
the
whole
night
in
the
park
and
try
not
to
frighten
the
deer
no
i
do
not
need
any
assistance
with
my
candle
and
i
am
quite
used
to
going
upstairs
by
myself
thank
you
ca
you
hear
what
personal
and
appropriate
remarks
tommy
is
making
down
there
now
do
run
away
master
garthie
and
count
your
pearls
and
if
you
suddenly
come
upon
a
cross
remember
the
cross
can
in
all
probability
be
persuaded
to
return
to
chicago
jane
was
still
smiling
as
she
entered
her
room
and
placed
her
candlestick
on
the
overdene
was
lighted
solely
by
lamps
and
candles
the
duchess
refused
to
modernise
it
by
the
installation
of
electric
light
but
candles
abounded
and
jane
who
liked
a
brilliant
illumination
proceeded
to
light
both
candles
in
the
branches
on
either
side
of
the
mirror
and
in
the
sconces
on
the
wall
beside
the
mantelpiece
and
in
the
tall
silver
candlesticks
upon
the
then
she
seated
herself
in
a
comfortable
reached
for
her
took
out
her
diary
and
a
fountain
pen
and
prepared
to
finish
the
entry
she
wrote
sang
rosary
at
aunt
concert
in
place
of
velma
failed
laryngitis
and
came
to
a
full
stop
somehow
the
scene
with
garth
was
difficult
to
record
and
the
sensations
which
still
remained
therefrom
absolutely
unwritable
jane
sat
and
pondered
the
situation
content
to
allow
the
page
to
remain
blank
before
she
rose
locked
her
book
and
prepared
for
rest
she
had
to
her
own
satisfaction
clearly
explained
the
whole
thing
artistic
temperament
was
the
basis
of
the
argument
and
alas
the
artistic
temperament
is
not
a
very
firm
foundation
either
for
a
theory
or
for
the
fabric
of
a
destiny
however
faute
de
mieux
jane
had
to
accept
it
as
main
factor
in
her
mental
adjustment
thus
this
vibrant
emotion
in
garth
so
strangely
disturbing
to
her
own
solid
calm
was
in
no
sense
personal
to
herself
excepting
in
so
far
as
her
voice
and
musical
gifts
were
concerned
just
as
the
sight
of
paintable
beauty
crazed
him
with
delight
making
him
wild
with
alternate
hope
and
despair
until
he
obtained
his
wish
and
had
his
canvas
and
his
sitter
arranged
to
his
liking
so
now
his
passion
for
the
beautiful
had
been
awakened
this
time
through
the
medium
not
of
sight
but
of
sound
when
she
had
given
him
his
fill
of
song
and
allowed
him
to
play
some
of
her
accompaniments
he
would
be
content
and
that
disquieting
look
of
adoration
would
pass
from
those
beautiful
brown
eyes
meanwhile
it
was
pleasant
to
look
forward
to
though
it
behooved
her
to
remember
that
all
this
admiration
had
in
it
nothing
personal
to
herself
he
would
have
gone
into
even
greater
raptures
over
madame
blanche
for
instance
who
had
the
same
timbre
of
voice
and
method
of
singing
combined
with
a
beauty
of
person
which
delighted
the
eye
the
while
her
voice
enchanted
the
ear
certainly
garth
must
see
and
hear
her
as
music
appeared
to
mean
so
much
to
him
jane
began
planning
this
and
then
her
mind
turned
to
pauline
lister
the
lovely
american
girl
whose
name
had
been
coupled
with
garth
dalmain
all
the
season
jane
felt
certain
she
was
just
the
wife
he
needed
her
loveliness
would
content
him
her
shrewd
and
straightforward
practical
ways
would
counterbalance
his
somewhat
erratic
temperament
and
her
adaptability
would
enable
her
to
suit
herself
to
his
surroundings
both
in
his
northern
home
and
amongst
his
large
circle
of
friends
down
south
once
married
he
would
give
up
raving
about
flower
and
myra
and
kissing
people
hands
in
that
absurd
way
jane
was
going
to
say
but
she
was
invariably
truthful
even
in
her
thoughts
and
substituted
extraordinary
as
the
more
correct
adjective
in
that
extraordinary
way
she
sat
forward
in
her
chair
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
held
her
large
hands
before
her
palms
upward
realising
again
the
sensations
of
that
moment
then
she
pulled
herself
up
sharply
jane
champion
be
a
fool
you
would
wrong
that
dear
boy
more
than
you
would
wrong
yourself
if
you
took
him
for
one
moment
seriously
his
homage
was
no
more
personal
to
you
than
his
appreciation
of
the
excellent
dinner
was
personal
to
aunt
georgina
chef
in
his
enjoyment
of
the
production
the
producer
was
included
but
that
was
all
be
gratified
at
the
success
of
your
art
and
do
not
spoil
that
success
by
any
absurd
sentimentality
now
wash
your
very
ungainly
hands
and
go
to
bed
thus
jane
to
herself
and
under
the
oaks
with
soft
turf
beneath
his
feet
stood
garth
dalmain
the
shy
deer
sleeping
around
unconscious
of
his
presence
the
planets
above
hanging
like
lamps
in
the
deep
purple
of
the
sky
and
he
also
soliloquised
i
have
found
her
he
said
in
low
tones
of
rapture
the
ideal
woman
the
crown
of
womanhood
the
perfect
mate
for
the
spirit
soul
and
body
of
the
man
who
can
win
jane
jane
ah
how
blind
i
have
been
to
have
known
her
for
years
and
yet
not
realised
her
to
be
this
but
she
lifted
the
veil
and
i
passed
in
ah
grand
noble
heart
she
will
never
be
able
to
draw
the
veil
again
between
her
soul
and
mine
and
she
has
no
rosary
i
thank
god
for
that
no
other
man
possesses
or
has
ever
possessed
that
which
i
desire
more
than
i
ever
desired
anything
upon
this
earth
jane
love
jane
tenderness
ah
what
will
it
mean
count
each
pearl
she
will
count
them
some
day
her
pearls
and
mine
god
spare
us
the
cross
must
there
be
a
cross
to
every
true
rosary
then
god
give
me
the
heavy
end
and
may
the
mutual
bearing
of
it
bind
us
together
ah
those
dear
hands
ah
those
true
steadfast
eyes
jane
jane
surely
it
has
always
been
jane
though
i
did
not
know
it
blind
fool
that
i
have
been
but
one
thing
i
know
whereas
i
was
blind
now
i
see
and
it
will
always
be
jane
from
this
night
onward
through
time
god
into
eternity
the
night
breeze
stirred
his
thick
dark
hair
and
his
eyes
as
he
raised
them
shone
in
the
starlight
and
jane
almost
asleep
was
roused
by
the
tapping
of
her
blind
against
the
casement
and
murmured
anything
you
wish
garth
just
tell
me
and
i
will
do
it
then
awakening
suddenly
to
the
consciousness
of
what
she
had
said
she
sat
up
in
the
darkness
and
scolded
herself
furiously
oh
you
donkey
you
call
yourself
staid
and
sensible
and
a
little
flattery
from
a
boy
of
whom
you
are
fond
turns
your
head
completely
come
to
your
senses
at
once
or
leave
overdene
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
chapter
viii
added
pearls
the
days
which
followed
were
golden
days
to
jane
there
was
nothing
to
spoil
the
enjoyment
of
a
very
new
and
strangely
sweet
experience
garth
manner
the
next
morning
held
none
of
the
excitement
or
outward
demonstration
which
had
perplexed
and
troubled
her
the
evening
before
he
was
very
quiet
and
seemed
to
jane
older
than
she
had
ever
known
him
he
had
very
few
lapses
into
his
mood
even
with
the
duchess
and
when
someone
chaffingly
asked
him
whether
he
was
practising
the
correct
deportment
of
a
man
yes
said
garth
quietly
i
am
will
she
be
at
shenstone
inquired
ronald
for
several
of
the
duchess
party
were
due
at
lady
ingleby
for
the
following
yes
said
garth
she
will
oh
lor
cried
billy
dramatically
prithee
benedict
are
we
to
take
this
seriously
but
jane
who
wrapped
in
the
morning
paper
sat
near
where
garth
was
standing
came
out
from
behind
it
to
look
up
at
him
and
say
so
that
only
he
heard
it
oh
dal
i
am
so
glad
did
you
make
up
your
mind
last
night
yes
said
garth
turning
so
that
he
spoke
to
her
alone
last
night
did
our
talk
in
the
afternoon
have
something
to
do
with
it
no
nothing
whatever
was
it
the
rosary
he
hesitated
then
said
without
looking
at
her
the
revelation
of
the
rosary
yes
to
jane
his
mood
of
excitement
was
now
fully
explained
and
she
could
give
herself
up
freely
to
the
enjoyment
of
this
new
phase
in
their
friendship
for
the
hours
of
music
together
were
a
very
real
delight
garth
was
more
of
a
musician
than
she
had
known
and
she
enjoyed
his
clean
masculine
touch
on
the
piano
unblurred
by
slur
or
pedal
more
delicate
than
her
own
where
delicacy
was
required
what
her
voice
was
to
him
during
those
wonderful
hours
he
did
not
express
in
words
for
after
that
first
evening
he
put
a
firm
restraint
upon
his
speech
under
the
oaks
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
a
week
before
speaking
and
he
waited
but
the
new
and
strangely
sweet
experience
to
jane
was
that
of
being
absolutely
first
to
some
one
in
ways
known
only
to
himself
and
to
her
garth
made
her
feel
this
there
was
nothing
for
any
one
else
to
notice
and
yet
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
she
never
came
into
the
room
without
his
being
instantly
conscious
that
she
was
there
that
she
never
left
a
room
without
being
at
once
missed
by
him
his
attentions
were
so
unobtrusive
and
tactful
that
no
one
else
realised
them
they
called
forth
no
chaff
from
friends
and
no
what
now
from
the
duchess
and
yet
his
devotion
seemed
always
surrounding
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
jane
was
made
to
feel
herself
first
in
the
whole
thought
of
another
it
made
him
seem
strangely
her
own
she
took
a
pleasure
and
pride
in
all
he
said
and
did
and
was
and
in
the
hours
they
spent
together
in
the
she
learned
to
know
him
and
to
understand
that
enthusiastic
irresponsible
nature
as
she
had
never
understood
it
before
the
days
were
golden
and
the
parting
at
night
was
sweet
because
it
gave
an
added
zest
to
the
pleasure
of
meeting
in
the
morning
and
yet
during
these
golden
days
the
thought
of
love
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
never
entered
jane
mind
her
ignorance
in
this
matter
arose
not
so
much
from
inexperience
as
from
too
large
an
experience
of
the
travesty
of
the
real
thing
an
experience
which
hindered
her
from
recognising
love
itself
now
that
love
in
its
most
ideal
form
was
drawing
near
jane
had
not
come
through
a
dozen
seasons
without
receiving
nearly
a
dozen
proposals
of
marriage
an
heiress
independent
of
parents
and
guardians
of
good
blood
and
lineage
a
few
proposals
of
a
certain
type
were
inevitable
men
becoming
bald
and
grey
tired
of
racketing
about
town
with
beautiful
old
country
places
and
an
unfortunate
lack
of
the
wherewithal
to
keep
them
up
proposed
to
the
honourable
jane
champion
in
a
way
and
the
honourable
jane
looked
them
up
and
down
and
through
and
through
until
they
felt
very
cheap
and
then
quietly
refused
them
in
an
equally
way
two
or
three
nice
boys
whom
she
had
pulled
out
of
scrapes
and
set
on
their
feet
again
after
hopeless
croppers
had
thought
in
a
wave
of
maudlin
gratitude
how
good
it
would
be
for
a
fellow
always
to
have
her
at
hand
to
keep
him
straight
and
tell
him
what
he
ought
to
do
you
know
and
er
well
yes
pay
his
debts
and
be
a
sort
of
scold
kind
of
person
to
him
and
had
caught
hold
of
her
kind
hand
and
implored
her
to
marry
them
jane
had
slapped
them
if
they
ventured
to
touch
her
and
recommended
them
not
to
be
silly
one
solemn
proposal
she
had
had
quite
lately
from
the
bachelor
rector
of
a
parish
adjoining
overdene
he
had
often
inflicted
wearisome
conversations
upon
her
and
when
he
called
intending
to
put
the
momentous
question
jane
who
was
sitting
at
her
in
the
overdene
did
not
see
any
occasion
to
move
from
it
if
the
rector
became
too
prosy
she
could
surreptitiously
finish
a
few
notes
he
sank
into
a
deep
close
to
the
crossed
his
somewhat
bandy
legs
one
over
the
other
made
the
tips
of
his
fingers
meet
with
unctuous
accuracy
and
intoned
the
opening
sentences
of
his
proposition
jane
sharpening
pencils
and
sorting
nibs
apparently
only
caught
the
drift
of
what
he
was
saying
for
when
he
had
chanted
the
phrase
not
alone
from
selfish
motives
my
dear
miss
champion
but
for
the
good
of
my
parish
for
the
welfare
of
my
flock
for
the
advancement
of
the
work
of
the
church
in
our
midst
jane
opened
a
and
drew
out
her
i
shall
be
delighted
to
subscribe
bilberry
she
said
is
it
for
a
font
a
pulpit
new
or
what
my
dear
lady
said
the
rector
tremulously
you
misunderstand
me
my
desire
is
to
lead
you
to
the
altar
dear
bilberry
said
jane
champion
that
would
be
quite
unnecessary
from
any
part
of
your
church
the
fact
that
you
need
a
new
is
absolutely
patent
to
all
comers
i
will
with
the
greatest
pleasure
give
you
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
towards
it
i
have
attended
your
church
rather
often
lately
because
i
enjoy
a
long
quiet
walk
by
myself
through
the
woods
and
now
i
am
sure
you
would
like
to
see
my
aunt
before
you
go
she
is
in
the
aviary
feeding
her
foreign
birds
if
you
go
out
by
that
window
and
pass
along
the
terrace
to
your
left
you
will
find
the
aviary
and
the
duchess
i
would
suggest
the
advisability
of
not
mentioning
this
conversation
to
my
aunt
she
does
not
approve
of
elaborate
and
would
scold
us
both
and
insist
on
the
money
being
spent
in
providing
boots
for
the
school
children
no
please
do
not
thank
me
i
am
really
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
helping
on
your
excellent
work
in
this
neighbourhood
jane
wondered
once
or
twice
whether
the
cheque
would
be
cashed
she
would
have
liked
to
receive
it
back
by
post
torn
in
half
with
a
few
wrathful
lines
of
manly
indignation
but
when
it
returned
to
her
in
due
course
from
her
bankers
it
was
indorsed
bilberry
in
a
neat
scholarly
hand
without
even
a
dash
of
indignation
beneath
it
and
she
threw
it
into
the
basket
with
rather
a
bitter
smile
these
were
jane
experiences
of
offers
of
marriage
she
had
never
been
loved
for
her
own
sake
she
had
never
felt
herself
really
first
in
the
heart
and
life
of
another
and
now
when
the
adoring
love
of
a
whole
being
was
tenderly
cautiously
beginning
to
surround
and
envelop
her
she
did
not
recognise
the
reason
of
her
happiness
or
of
his
devotion
she
considered
him
the
avowed
lover
of
another
woman
with
whose
youth
and
loveliness
she
would
not
have
dreamed
of
competing
and
she
regarded
this
closeness
of
intimacy
between
herself
and
garth
as
a
development
of
a
friendship
more
beautiful
than
she
had
hitherto
considered
possible
thus
matters
stood
when
tuesday
arrived
and
the
overdene
party
broke
up
jane
went
to
town
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
with
the
brands
garth
went
straight
to
shenstone
where
he
had
been
asked
expressly
to
meet
miss
lister
and
her
aunt
parker
bangs
jane
was
due
at
shenstone
on
friday
for
the
chapter
ix
lady
ingleby
house
party
as
jane
took
her
seat
and
the
train
moved
out
of
the
london
terminus
she
leaned
back
in
her
corner
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
somehow
these
days
in
town
had
seemed
insufferably
long
jane
reviewed
them
thoughtfully
and
sought
the
reason
they
had
been
filled
with
interests
and
engagements
and
the
very
fact
of
being
in
town
as
a
rule
contented
her
why
had
she
felt
so
restless
and
dissatisfied
and
lonely
from
force
of
habit
she
had
just
stopped
at
the
railway
for
her
usual
pile
of
literature
her
friends
always
said
jane
could
not
go
even
the
shortest
journey
without
at
least
half
a
dozen
papers
but
now
they
lay
unheeded
on
the
seat
in
front
of
her
jane
was
considering
her
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
and
wondering
why
they
had
merely
been
weary
to
friday
and
here
was
friday
at
last
and
once
in
the
train
en
route
for
shenstone
she
began
to
feel
happy
and
exhilarated
what
had
been
the
matter
with
these
three
days
flower
had
been
charming
deryck
his
own
friendly
interesting
self
little
dicky
delightful
and
baby
blossom
as
sweet
as
only
baby
blossom
could
be
what
was
amiss
i
know
said
jane
of
course
why
did
i
not
realise
it
before
i
had
too
much
music
during
those
last
days
at
overdene
and
such
music
i
have
been
suffering
from
a
surfeit
of
music
and
the
miss
of
it
has
given
me
this
blank
feeling
of
loneliness
no
doubt
we
shall
have
plenty
at
myra
and
dal
will
be
there
to
clamour
for
it
if
myra
fails
to
suggest
it
with
a
happy
little
smile
of
pleasurable
anticipation
jane
took
up
the
spectator
and
was
soon
absorbed
in
an
article
on
the
south
african
problem
myra
met
her
at
the
station
driving
ponies
tandem
a
light
cart
was
also
there
for
the
maid
and
baggage
and
without
losing
a
moment
jane
and
her
hostess
were
off
along
the
country
lane
at
a
brisk
trot
the
fields
and
woods
were
an
exquisite
restful
green
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
wild
roses
clustered
in
the
hedges
the
last
loads
of
hay
were
being
carted
in
there
was
an
ecstasy
in
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
a
transporting
sense
of
sweetness
about
all
the
sights
and
scents
of
the
country
such
as
jane
had
never
experienced
so
vividly
before
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
exclaimed
almost
involuntarily
ah
it
is
good
to
be
here
you
dear
said
lady
ingleby
twirling
her
whip
and
nodding
in
gracious
response
to
respectful
salutes
from
the
it
is
a
comfort
to
have
you
i
always
feel
you
are
like
the
bass
of
a
tune
something
so
solid
and
satisfactory
and
beneath
one
in
case
of
a
crisis
i
hate
crises
they
are
so
tiring
as
i
say
why
ca
things
always
go
on
as
they
are
they
are
as
they
were
and
they
were
as
they
will
be
if
only
people
would
bother
however
i
am
certain
nothing
could
go
far
wrong
when
you
are
anywhere
near
myra
flicked
the
leader
who
was
inclined
to
sugar
and
they
flew
along
between
the
high
hedges
brushing
lightly
against
overhanging
masses
of
honeysuckle
and
wild
clematis
jane
snatched
a
spray
of
the
clematis
in
passing
joy
she
said
with
that
same
quiet
smile
of
glad
anticipation
and
put
the
white
blossom
in
her
buttonhole
well
continued
lady
ingleby
my
house
party
is
going
on
quite
satisfactorily
oh
and
jane
there
seems
no
doubt
about
dal
how
pleased
i
shall
be
if
it
comes
off
under
my
wing
the
american
girl
is
simply
exquisite
and
so
vivacious
and
charming
and
dal
has
quite
given
up
being
silly
not
that
ever
thought
him
silly
but
i
know
you
did
and
is
very
quiet
and
pensive
really
were
it
any
one
but
he
one
would
almost
say
and
they
roam
about
together
in
the
most
approved
fashion
i
try
to
get
the
aunt
to
make
all
her
remarks
to
me
i
am
so
afraid
of
her
putting
dal
off
he
is
so
fastidious
i
have
promised
billy
anything
up
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
if
he
will
sit
at
the
feet
of
parker
bangs
and
listen
to
her
wisdom
answer
her
questions
and
keep
her
away
from
dal
billy
is
being
so
abjectly
devoted
in
his
attentions
to
parker
bangs
that
i
begin
to
have
fears
lest
he
intends
asking
me
to
kiss
him
in
which
case
i
shall
hand
him
over
to
you
to
chastise
you
manage
these
boys
so
splendidly
i
fully
believe
dal
will
propose
to
pauline
lister
tonight
i
imagine
why
he
did
last
night
there
was
a
most
perfect
moon
and
they
went
on
the
lake
what
more
could
dal
want
a
lake
and
a
moon
and
that
lovely
girl
billy
took
parker
bangs
in
a
double
canoe
and
nearly
upset
her
through
laughing
so
much
at
the
things
she
said
about
having
to
sit
flat
on
the
bottom
but
he
paddled
her
off
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
from
dal
and
her
niece
which
was
all
we
wanted
parker
bangs
asked
me
afterwards
whether
billy
is
a
widower
now
what
do
you
suppose
she
meant
by
that
i
have
the
faintest
idea
said
jane
but
i
am
delighted
to
hear
about
dal
and
miss
lister
she
is
just
the
girl
for
him
and
she
will
soon
adapt
herself
to
his
ways
and
needs
besides
dal
must
have
flawless
loveliness
and
really
he
gets
it
there
he
does
indeed
said
myra
you
should
have
seen
her
last
night
in
white
satin
with
wild
roses
in
her
hair
i
can
not
imagine
why
dal
did
not
rave
but
perhaps
it
is
a
good
sign
that
he
should
take
things
more
quietly
i
suppose
he
is
making
up
his
mind
no
said
jane
i
believe
he
did
that
at
overdene
but
it
means
a
lot
to
him
he
takes
marriage
very
seriously
whom
have
you
at
shenstone
lady
ingleby
told
off
a
list
of
names
jane
knew
them
all
delightful
she
said
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
be
here
london
has
been
so
hot
and
so
dull
i
never
thought
it
hot
or
dull
before
i
feel
a
renegade
ah
there
is
the
lovely
little
church
i
want
to
hear
the
new
organ
i
was
glad
your
nice
parson
remembered
me
and
let
me
have
a
share
in
it
has
it
two
manuals
or
three
half
a
dozen
i
think
said
lady
ingleby
and
you
work
them
up
and
down
with
your
feet
but
i
judged
it
wiser
to
leave
them
alone
when
i
played
for
the
children
service
one
sunday
you
never
know
quite
what
will
happen
if
you
touch
those
mechanical
affairs
do
you
mean
the
composition
pedals
suggested
jane
i
dare
say
i
do
said
myra
placidly
those
things
underneath
like
which
startle
you
horribly
if
you
accidentally
kick
them
jane
smiled
at
the
thought
of
how
garth
would
throw
back
his
head
and
shout
if
she
told
him
of
this
conversation
lady
ingleby
musical
remarks
always
amused
her
friends
they
passed
the
village
church
on
the
green
picturesque
and
half
a
minute
later
swerved
in
at
the
park
gates
myra
saw
jane
glance
at
the
they
had
just
shaved
and
laughed
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
she
said
as
they
dashed
up
the
long
drive
between
the
elms
as
i
told
dear
mamma
when
she
expostulated
wrathfully
with
me
for
what
she
called
my
driving
the
other
day
by
the
way
jane
dear
mamma
has
been
quite
cordial
lately
by
the
time
i
am
seventy
and
she
is
i
think
she
will
begin
to
be
almost
fond
of
me
here
we
are
do
notice
lawson
he
is
new
and
such
a
nice
man
he
sings
so
well
and
plays
the
concertina
a
little
and
teaches
in
the
and
speaks
really
quite
excellently
at
temperance
meetings
he
is
extremely
fond
of
mowing
the
lawns
and
my
maid
tells
me
he
is
studying
french
with
her
the
only
thing
he
seems
really
incapable
of
being
is
an
efficient
butler
which
is
so
unfortunate
as
i
like
him
far
too
well
ever
to
part
with
him
michael
says
i
have
a
perfectly
fatal
habit
of
liking
people
and
of
encouraging
them
to
do
the
things
they
do
well
and
enjoy
doing
instead
of
the
things
they
were
engaged
to
do
i
suppose
i
have
but
i
do
like
my
household
to
be
happy
they
alighted
and
myra
trailed
into
the
hall
with
a
lazy
grace
which
gave
no
indication
of
the
masterly
way
she
had
handled
her
ponies
but
rather
suggested
stepping
from
a
comfortable
seat
in
a
barouche
jane
looked
with
interest
at
the
who
came
forward
and
deftly
assisted
them
he
had
not
quite
the
air
of
a
butler
but
neither
could
she
imagine
him
playing
a
concertina
or
haranguing
a
temperance
meeting
and
he
acquitted
himself
quite
creditably
oh
that
was
not
lawson
explained
myra
as
she
led
the
way
upstairs
i
had
forgotten
he
had
to
go
to
the
vicarage
this
afternoon
to
see
the
vicar
about
a
of
song
they
are
getting
up
that
was
tom
but
we
call
him
in
the
house
he
was
one
of
michael
stud
grooms
but
he
is
engaged
to
one
of
the
housemaids
and
i
found
he
so
very
much
preferred
being
in
the
house
so
i
have
arranged
for
him
to
understudy
lawson
and
he
is
growing
side
whiskers
i
shall
have
to
break
it
to
michael
on
his
return
from
norway
this
way
jane
we
have
put
you
in
the
magnolia
room
i
knew
you
would
enjoy
the
view
of
the
lake
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
a
tennis
tournament
is
in
progress
i
must
hasten
to
the
courts
tea
will
be
going
on
there
under
the
chestnuts
dal
and
ronnie
are
to
play
the
final
for
the
men
singles
it
ought
to
be
a
fine
match
it
was
to
come
on
at
about
four
do
wait
to
do
any
changings
your
maid
and
your
luggage
ca
be
here
just
yet
thanks
said
jane
i
always
travel
in
country
clothes
and
have
done
so
as
you
see
i
will
just
get
rid
of
the
railway
dust
and
follow
you
ten
minutes
later
guided
by
sounds
of
cheering
and
laughter
jane
made
her
way
through
the
shrubbery
to
the
tennis
lawns
the
whole
of
lady
ingleby
house
party
was
assembled
there
forming
a
picturesque
group
under
the
white
and
scarlet
beyond
on
the
beautifully
kept
turf
of
the
court
an
exciting
set
was
in
progress
as
she
approached
jane
could
distinguish
garth
slim
agile
figure
in
white
flannels
and
the
violet
shirt
and
young
ronnie
huge
and
powerful
trusting
to
the
terrific
force
of
his
cuts
and
drives
to
counterbalance
garth
keener
eye
and
swifter
turn
of
wrist
it
was
a
fine
game
garth
had
won
the
first
set
by
six
to
four
and
now
the
score
stood
at
five
to
four
in
ronnie
favour
but
this
game
was
garth
service
and
he
was
almost
certain
to
win
it
the
score
would
then
be
games
all
jane
walked
along
the
line
of
garden
chairs
to
where
she
saw
a
vacant
one
near
myra
she
was
greeted
with
delight
but
hurriedly
by
the
eager
watchers
of
the
game
suddenly
a
howl
went
up
garth
had
made
two
faults
jane
found
her
chair
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
game
almost
instantly
shrieks
of
astonishment
and
surprise
again
arose
garth
had
served
into
the
net
and
over
the
line
game
and
set
were
ronnie
one
all
remarked
billy
well
i
never
saw
dal
do
that
before
however
it
gives
us
the
bliss
of
watching
another
set
they
are
splendidly
matched
dal
is
lightning
and
ronnie
thunder
the
players
crossed
over
garth
rather
white
beneath
his
tan
he
was
beyond
words
vexed
with
himself
for
failing
in
his
service
at
that
critical
juncture
not
that
he
minded
losing
the
set
but
it
seemed
to
him
it
must
be
patent
to
the
whole
crowd
that
it
was
the
sight
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
of
a
tall
grey
figure
moving
quietly
along
the
line
of
chairs
which
for
a
moment
or
two
set
earth
and
sky
whirling
and
made
a
confused
blur
of
net
and
lines
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
one
of
the
onlookers
connected
garth
loss
of
the
game
with
arrival
and
she
was
the
lovely
girl
seated
exactly
opposite
the
net
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
smile
and
a
word
as
he
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
court
the
last
set
proved
the
most
exciting
of
the
three
nine
games
five
to
garth
four
to
ronnie
and
now
ronnie
was
serving
and
fighting
hard
to
make
it
over
and
over
enthusiastic
partisans
of
both
shouted
deuce
and
then
when
garth
had
won
the
vantage
a
slashing
service
from
ronnie
beat
him
and
it
was
deuce
again
do
it
make
one
giddy
said
parker
bangs
to
billy
who
reclined
on
the
sward
at
her
feet
i
should
say
it
has
gone
on
long
enough
and
they
must
both
be
wanting
their
tea
it
would
have
been
kind
in
dalmain
to
have
let
that
ball
pass
anyway
yes
would
it
said
billy
earnestly
but
you
see
dal
is
not
naturally
kind
now
if
i
had
been
playing
against
ronnie
i
should
have
let
those
balls
of
his
pass
long
ago
i
am
sure
you
would
said
parker
bangs
approvingly
while
jane
leaned
over
at
myra
request
and
pinched
billy
slash
went
ronnie
racket
deuce
deuce
shouted
half
a
dozen
voices
they
should
say
that
remarked
parker
bangs
even
if
they
are
mad
about
it
billy
hugged
his
knees
delightedly
looking
up
at
her
with
an
expression
of
seraphic
innocence
no
is
it
sad
he
murmured
i
never
say
naughty
words
when
i
play
i
always
say
love
it
sounds
so
much
nicer
i
think
jane
pinched
again
but
billy
rapt
gaze
at
parker
bangs
continued
billy
said
myra
sternly
go
into
the
hall
and
fetch
my
scarlet
sunshade
yes
i
dare
say
you
will
miss
the
finish
she
added
in
a
stern
whisper
as
he
leaned
over
her
chair
remonstrating
but
you
richly
deserve
it
i
have
made
up
my
mind
what
to
ask
dear
queen
whispered
billy
as
he
returned
breathless
three
minutes
later
and
laid
the
parasol
in
lady
ingleby
lap
you
promised
me
anything
up
to
the
half
of
your
kingdom
i
will
have
the
head
of
parker
bangs
in
a
charger
oh
shut
up
billy
exclaimed
jane
and
get
out
of
the
light
we
missed
that
last
stroke
what
is
the
score
once
again
it
was
garth
vantage
and
once
again
ronnie
arm
swung
high
for
an
untakable
smasher
play
up
dal
cried
a
voice
amid
the
general
hubbub
garth
knew
that
dear
voice
he
did
not
look
in
its
direction
but
he
smiled
the
next
moment
his
arm
shot
out
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
ball
touched
ground
on
ronnie
side
of
the
net
and
shot
the
length
of
the
court
without
rising
ronnie
wild
scoop
at
it
was
hopeless
game
and
set
were
garth
they
walked
off
the
ground
together
their
rackets
under
their
arms
the
flush
of
a
fight
on
their
handsome
faces
it
had
been
so
near
a
thing
that
both
could
sense
the
thrill
of
victory
pauline
lister
had
been
sitting
with
garth
coat
on
her
lap
and
his
watch
and
chain
were
in
her
keeping
he
paused
a
moment
to
take
them
up
and
receive
her
congratulations
then
slipping
on
his
coat
and
pocketing
his
watch
came
straight
to
jane
how
do
you
do
miss
champion
his
eyes
sought
hers
eagerly
and
the
welcoming
gladness
he
saw
in
them
filled
him
with
certainty
and
content
he
had
missed
her
so
unutterably
during
these
days
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
had
just
been
weary
to
friday
it
seemed
incredible
that
one
absence
could
make
so
vast
a
difference
and
yet
how
perfect
that
it
should
be
so
and
that
they
should
both
realise
it
now
the
day
had
come
when
he
intended
to
tell
her
how
desperately
he
wanted
her
always
yes
that
they
should
both
realise
it
for
he
felt
certain
jane
had
also
experienced
the
blank
a
thing
so
complete
and
overwhelming
as
the
miss
of
her
had
been
to
him
could
not
be
and
how
well
worth
the
experience
of
these
lonely
days
if
they
had
thereby
learned
something
of
what
together
meant
now
the
words
were
to
be
spoken
which
should
insure
forever
no
more
such
partings
all
this
sped
through
garth
mind
as
he
greeted
jane
with
that
most
commonplace
of
english
greetings
the
everlasting
question
which
never
receives
an
answer
but
from
garth
at
that
moment
it
did
not
sound
commonplace
to
jane
and
she
answered
it
quite
frankly
and
fully
she
wanted
above
all
things
to
tell
him
exactly
how
she
did
to
hear
all
about
himself
and
compare
notes
on
the
happenings
of
these
three
interminable
days
and
to
take
up
their
close
comradeship
again
exactly
where
it
had
left
off
her
hand
went
home
to
his
with
that
firm
completeness
of
clasp
which
always
made
a
hand
shake
with
jane
such
a
satisfactory
and
really
friendly
thing
very
fit
thank
you
dal
she
answered
at
least
i
am
every
moment
improving
in
health
and
spirits
now
i
have
arrived
here
at
last
garth
stood
his
racket
against
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
deposited
himself
full
length
on
the
grass
beside
her
leaning
on
his
elbow
was
anything
wrong
with
london
he
asked
rather
low
not
looking
up
at
her
but
at
the
smart
brown
shoe
planted
firmly
on
the
grass
so
near
his
hand
nothing
was
wrong
with
london
replied
jane
frankly
it
was
hot
and
dusty
of
course
but
delightful
as
usual
something
was
wrong
with
me
and
you
will
be
ashamed
of
me
dal
if
i
confess
what
it
was
garth
did
not
look
up
but
assiduously
picked
little
blades
of
grass
and
laid
them
in
a
pattern
on
jane
shoe
this
conversation
would
have
been
exactly
to
the
point
had
they
been
alone
but
was
jane
really
going
to
announce
to
the
assembled
company
in
that
dear
resonant
carrying
voice
of
hers
the
sweet
secret
of
their
miss
of
one
another
liver
inquired
parker
bangs
suddenly
muffins
exclaimed
billy
instantly
and
rushing
for
them
almost
shot
them
into
her
lap
in
the
haste
with
which
he
handed
them
stumbling
headlong
over
garth
legs
at
the
same
moment
jane
stared
at
parker
bangs
and
her
muffins
then
looked
down
at
the
top
of
garth
dark
head
bent
low
over
the
grass
i
was
dull
she
said
intolerably
dull
and
dal
always
says
a
dullard
is
dull
but
i
diagnosed
my
dulness
in
the
train
just
now
and
found
it
was
largely
his
fault
do
you
hear
dal
garth
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
realising
in
that
moment
that
it
was
after
all
possible
for
a
complete
and
overwhelming
experience
to
be
jane
calm
grey
eyes
were
full
of
gay
friendliness
it
was
your
fault
my
dear
boy
said
jane
how
so
queried
garth
and
though
there
was
a
deep
flush
on
his
sunburned
face
his
voice
was
quietly
interrogative
because
during
those
last
days
at
overdene
you
led
me
on
into
a
time
of
musical
dissipation
such
as
i
had
never
known
before
and
i
missed
it
to
a
degree
which
was
positively
alarming
i
began
to
fear
for
the
balance
of
my
mind
well
said
myra
coming
out
from
behind
her
red
parasol
you
and
dal
can
have
orgies
of
music
here
if
you
want
them
you
will
find
a
piano
in
the
and
another
in
the
hall
and
a
bechstein
grand
in
the
that
is
where
i
hold
the
practices
for
the
men
and
maids
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
which
makers
i
really
preferred
erard
broadwood
collard
or
bechstein
so
by
degrees
i
collected
one
of
each
and
after
all
i
think
i
play
best
upon
the
little
cottage
piano
we
had
in
the
at
home
it
stands
in
my
boudoir
now
i
seem
more
accustomed
to
its
notes
or
it
lends
itself
better
to
my
way
of
playing
thank
you
myra
said
jane
i
fancy
dal
and
i
will
like
the
bechstein
and
if
you
want
something
really
exciting
in
the
way
of
music
continued
lady
ingleby
you
might
attend
some
of
the
rehearsals
for
this
of
song
they
are
getting
up
in
aid
of
the
organ
deficit
fund
i
believe
they
are
attempting
great
things
i
would
sooner
pay
off
the
whole
deficit
than
go
within
a
mile
of
a
of
song
said
jane
emphatically
oh
no
put
in
garth
quickly
noting
myra
look
of
disappointment
it
is
so
good
for
people
to
work
off
their
own
debts
and
earn
the
things
they
need
in
their
churches
and
of
song
are
delightful
if
well
done
as
i
am
sure
this
will
be
if
lady
people
are
in
it
lawson
outlined
it
to
me
this
morning
and
hummed
all
the
principal
airs
it
is
highly
dramatic
robinson
crusoe
no
of
course
not
what
the
beggar
name
tom
cabin
yes
i
knew
it
was
something
black
lawson
is
uncle
tom
and
the
vicar
small
daughter
is
to
be
little
eva
miss
champion
you
will
walk
down
with
me
to
the
very
next
rehearsal
shall
i
said
jane
unconscious
of
how
tender
was
the
smile
she
gave
him
conscious
only
that
in
her
own
heart
was
the
remembrance
of
the
evening
at
overdene
when
she
felt
so
inclined
to
say
to
him
tell
me
just
what
you
want
me
to
do
and
i
will
do
it
pauline
will
just
love
to
go
with
you
said
parker
bangs
she
dotes
on
rural
music
rubbish
aunt
said
miss
lister
who
had
slipped
into
an
empty
chair
near
myra
i
agree
with
miss
champion
about
of
song
and
i
do
care
for
any
music
but
the
best
jane
turned
to
her
quickly
with
a
cordial
smile
and
her
most
friendly
manner
ah
but
you
must
come
she
said
we
will
be
victimised
together
and
perhaps
dal
and
lawson
will
succeed
in
converting
us
to
the
cult
of
the
of
song
and
anyway
it
will
be
amusing
to
have
dal
explain
it
to
us
he
will
need
the
courage
of
his
convictions
talking
of
something
exciting
in
the
way
of
music
said
pauline
lister
we
had
it
on
board
when
we
came
over
there
was
a
nice
friendly
crowd
on
board
the
arabic
and
they
arranged
a
concert
for
eight
on
the
thursday
evening
we
were
about
two
hundred
miles
off
the
coast
of
ireland
and
when
we
came
up
from
dinner
we
had
run
into
a
dense
fog
at
eight
they
started
blowing
the
every
and
while
the
was
sounding
you
could
hear
yourself
speak
however
all
the
programmes
were
printed
and
it
was
our
last
night
on
board
so
they
concluded
to
have
the
concert
all
the
same
down
we
all
trooped
into
the
saloon
and
each
item
of
that
programme
was
punctuated
by
the
stentorian
boo
of
the
every
thirty
seconds
you
never
heard
anything
so
cute
as
the
way
it
came
in
right
on
time
a
man
with
a
deep
bass
voice
sang
rocked
in
the
cradle
of
the
deep
and
each
time
he
reached
the
refrain
calm
and
peaceful
is
my
boo
went
the
casting
a
certain
amount
of
doubt
on
our
expectations
of
peaceful
sleep
that
night
anyway
then
a
man
with
a
sweet
tenor
sang
oft
in
the
stilly
night
and
the
showed
us
just
how
oft
namely
every
thirty
seconds
but
the
queerest
effect
of
all
was
when
a
girl
had
to
play
a
solo
it
was
something
of
chopin
full
of
runs
and
trills
and
little
silvery
notes
she
started
all
right
but
when
she
was
down
the
first
page
boo
went
the
a
longer
blast
than
usual
we
saw
her
fingers
flying
and
the
turning
of
the
page
but
not
a
note
could
we
hear
and
when
the
old
horn
stopped
and
we
could
hear
the
piano
again
she
had
reached
a
place
down
the
second
page
and
we
had
heard
what
led
to
it
my
it
was
funny
that
went
on
all
through
she
was
a
plucky
girl
to
stick
to
it
we
gave
her
a
good
round
of
applause
when
she
had
finished
and
the
joined
in
and
drowned
us
it
was
the
queerest
concert
experience
i
ever
had
but
we
all
enjoyed
it
only
we
did
enjoy
that
noise
keeping
right
on
until
five
next
morning
jane
had
turned
in
her
chair
and
listened
with
appreciative
interest
while
the
lovely
american
girl
talked
watching
with
real
delight
her
exquisite
face
and
graceful
gestures
and
thinking
how
dal
must
enjoy
looking
at
her
when
she
talked
with
so
much
charm
and
animation
she
glanced
down
trying
to
see
the
admiration
in
his
eyes
but
his
head
was
bent
and
he
was
apparently
absorbed
in
the
occupation
of
tracing
the
broguing
of
her
shoes
with
the
long
stalk
of
a
chestnut
leaf
for
a
moment
she
watched
the
slim
brown
hand
as
carefully
intent
on
this
useless
task
as
if
working
on
a
canvas
then
she
suddenly
withdrew
her
foot
feeling
almost
vexed
with
him
for
his
inattention
and
apparent
indifference
garth
sat
up
instantly
it
must
have
been
awfully
funny
he
said
and
how
well
you
told
it
one
could
hear
the
and
see
the
dismayed
faces
of
the
performers
like
an
earthquake
a
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
do
ever
get
used
to
it
sounds
worse
every
time
let
each
tell
the
funniest
thing
we
remember
at
a
concert
i
once
heard
a
youth
recite
tennyson
charge
of
the
light
brigade
with
much
dramatic
action
but
he
was
extremely
nervous
and
got
rather
mixed
in
describing
the
attitude
of
mind
of
the
noble
six
hundred
he
told
us
impressively
that
it
was
not
to
make
reply
theirs
not
to
do
or
die
theirs
but
to
reason
why
the
tone
and
action
were
all
right
and
i
doubt
whether
many
of
the
audience
noticed
anything
wrong
with
the
words
that
reminds
me
said
ronald
ingram
of
quite
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
heard
it
was
at
a
thanksgiving
service
when
some
of
our
troops
returned
from
south
africa
the
proceedings
concluded
by
the
singing
of
the
national
anthem
right
through
you
recollect
how
recently
we
had
had
to
make
the
change
of
pronoun
and
how
difficult
it
was
to
remember
not
to
shout
her
victorious
well
there
was
a
fellow
just
behind
me
with
a
tremendous
voice
singing
lustily
and
taking
special
pains
to
get
the
pronouns
correct
throughout
and
when
he
reached
the
fourth
line
of
the
second
verse
he
sang
with
loyal
fervour
his
politics
frustrate
his
knavish
tricks
that
would
amuse
the
king
said
lady
ingleby
are
you
sure
it
is
a
fact
ronnie
positive
i
could
tell
you
the
church
and
the
day
and
call
a
whole
pewful
of
witnesses
who
were
convulsed
by
it
well
i
shall
tell
his
majesty
at
the
next
opportunity
and
say
you
heard
it
but
how
about
the
tennis
what
comes
next
final
for
couples
oh
yes
dal
you
and
miss
lister
play
colonel
loraine
and
miss
vermount
and
i
think
you
ought
to
win
fairly
easily
you
two
are
so
well
matched
jane
this
will
be
worth
watching
i
am
sure
it
will
said
jane
warmly
looking
at
the
two
who
had
risen
and
stood
together
in
the
evening
sunlight
examining
their
rackets
and
discussing
possible
tactics
while
awaiting
their
opponents
they
made
such
a
radiantly
beautiful
couple
it
was
as
if
nature
had
put
her
very
best
and
loveliest
into
every
detail
of
each
the
only
fault
which
could
possibly
have
been
found
with
the
idea
of
them
wedded
was
that
her
dark
slim
beauty
was
so
very
much
just
a
feminine
edition
of
his
that
they
might
easily
have
been
taken
for
brother
and
sister
but
this
was
not
a
fault
which
occurred
to
jane
her
admiration
of
pauline
increased
every
time
she
looked
at
her
and
now
she
had
really
seen
them
together
she
felt
sure
she
had
given
wise
advice
to
garth
and
rejoiced
to
know
he
was
taking
it
later
on
as
they
strolled
back
to
the
house
together
she
and
garth
alone
jane
said
simply
dal
you
will
not
mind
if
i
ask
is
it
settled
yet
i
mind
nothing
you
ask
garth
replied
only
be
more
explicit
is
what
settled
are
you
and
miss
lister
engaged
no
garth
answered
what
made
you
suppose
we
should
be
you
said
at
overdene
on
tuesday
tuesday
oh
does
it
seem
weeks
ago
you
said
we
were
to
take
you
seriously
it
seems
years
ago
said
garth
and
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
take
me
seriously
all
the
same
i
have
not
proposed
to
miss
lister
and
i
am
anxious
for
an
undisturbed
talk
with
you
on
the
subject
miss
champion
after
dinner
when
all
the
games
and
amusements
are
in
full
swing
and
we
can
escape
unobserved
will
you
come
out
onto
the
terrace
with
me
where
i
shall
be
able
to
speak
to
you
without
fear
of
interruption
the
moonlight
on
the
lake
is
worth
seeing
from
the
terrace
i
spent
an
hour
out
there
last
night
ah
no
you
are
wrong
for
once
i
spent
it
alone
when
the
boating
was
over
and
thought
of
how
we
might
be
talking
there
together
certainly
i
will
come
said
jane
and
you
must
feel
free
to
tell
me
anything
you
wish
and
promise
to
let
me
advise
or
help
in
any
way
i
can
i
will
tell
you
everything
said
garth
very
low
and
you
shall
advise
and
help
as
only
you
can
jane
sat
on
her
enjoying
the
sunset
and
the
exquisite
view
and
glad
of
a
quiet
before
she
need
think
of
summoning
her
maid
immediately
below
her
ran
the
terrace
wide
and
gravelled
bounded
by
a
broad
stone
parapet
behind
which
was
a
drop
of
eight
or
ten
feet
to
the
garden
with
quaint
winding
walks
and
stone
fountains
beyond
a
stretch
of
smooth
lawn
sloping
down
to
the
lake
which
now
lay
a
silver
mirror
in
the
soft
evening
light
the
stillness
was
so
perfect
the
sense
of
peace
so
jane
held
a
book
on
her
knee
but
she
was
not
reading
she
was
looking
away
to
the
distant
woods
beyond
the
lake
then
to
the
pearly
sky
above
flecked
with
rosy
clouds
and
streaked
with
gleams
of
gold
and
a
sense
of
content
and
gladness
and
filled
her
presently
she
heard
a
light
step
on
the
gravel
below
and
leaned
forward
to
see
to
whom
it
belonged
garth
had
come
out
of
the
and
walked
briskly
to
and
fro
once
or
twice
then
he
threw
himself
into
a
wicker
seat
just
beneath
her
window
and
sat
there
smoking
meditatively
the
fragrance
of
his
cigarette
reached
jane
up
among
the
magnolia
blossoms
marcovitch
she
said
to
herself
and
smiled
packed
in
jolly
green
boxes
twelve
shillings
a
hundred
i
must
remember
in
case
i
want
to
give
him
a
christmas
present
by
then
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
anything
which
has
not
already
been
showered
upon
him
garth
flung
away
the
end
of
his
cigarette
and
commenced
humming
below
his
breath
then
gradually
broke
into
words
and
sang
softly
in
his
sweet
barytone
is
not
mine
to
sing
the
stately
grace
the
great
soul
beaming
in
my
lady
face
the
tones
though
quiet
were
so
vibrant
with
passionate
feeling
that
jane
felt
herself
an
eavesdropper
she
hastily
picked
a
large
magnolia
leaf
and
leaning
out
let
it
fall
upon
his
head
garth
started
and
looked
up
hullo
he
said
you
up
there

said
jane
laughing
down
at
him
and
speaking
low
lest
other
casements
should
be
open
i
up
here

are
serenading
the
wrong
window
dear
lover

lot

remarked
garth
rather
moodily
do
i
whispered
jane
but

not
mind
master
garthie
because
you
know
how
truly
i
care

old
margery
absence

must
let
me
be
mentor
garth
sprang
up
and
stood
erect
looking
up
at
her
shall
i
climb
the
magnolia
he
said
i
have
heaps
to
say
to
you
which
can
not
be
shouted
to
the
whole
front
of
the
house

jane
i

window

give

long
as
i

come
as
soon
as
we
can
possibly
escape
replied
jane
and
you
can
not
be
more
anxious
to
tell
me
everything
than
i
am
to
hear
it
oh
the
scent
of
these
magnolias
and
just
look
at
the
great
white
trumpets
would
you
like
one
for
your
buttonhole
he
gave
her
a
wistful
whimsical
little
smile
then
turned
and
went
indoors
why
do
i
feel
so
inclined
to
tease
him
mused
jane
as
she
moved
from
the
window
really
it
is
i
who
have
been
silly
this
time
and
he
staid
and
sensible
myra
is
quite
right
he
is
taking
it
very
seriously
and
how
about
her
ah
i
hope
she
cares
enough
and
in
the
right
come
in
matthews
and
you
can
put
out
the
gown
i
wore
on
the
night
of
the
concert
at
overdene
and
we
must
make
haste
we
have
just
twenty
minutes
what
a
lovely
evening
before
you
do
anything
else
come
and
see
this
sunset
on
the
lake
ah
it
is
good
to
be
here
chapter
x
the
revelation
all
the
impatience
in
the
world
could
not
prevent
dinner
at
shenstone
from
being
a
long
function
and
two
of
the
most
popular
people
in
the
party
could
not
easily
escape
afterwards
unnoticed
so
a
distant
clock
in
the
village
was
striking
ten
as
garth
and
jane
stepped
out
on
to
the
terrace
together
garth
caught
up
a
rug
in
passing
and
closed
the
door
of
the
lower
hall
carefully
behind
him
they
were
quite
alone
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
really
alone
since
these
days
apart
which
had
seemed
so
long
to
both
they
walked
silently
side
by
side
to
the
wide
stone
parapet
overlooking
the
garden
the
silvery
moonlight
flooded
the
whole
scene
with
radiance
they
could
see
the
stiff
the
winding
paths
the
queerly
shaped
and
beyond
the
lake
like
a
silver
mirror
reflecting
the
calm
loveliness
of
the
full
moon
garth
spread
the
rug
on
the
coping
and
jane
sat
down
he
stood
beside
her
one
foot
on
the
coping
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
his
head
erect
jane
had
seated
herself
sideways
turning
towards
him
her
back
to
an
old
stone
lion
mounting
guard
upon
the
parapet
but
she
turned
her
head
still
further
to
look
down
upon
the
lake
and
she
thought
garth
was
looking
in
the
same
direction
but
garth
was
looking
at
jane
she
wore
the
gown
of
soft
trailing
black
material
she
had
worn
at
the
overdene
concert
only
she
had
not
on
the
pearls
or
indeed
any
ornament
save
a
cluster
of
crimson
rambler
roses
they
nestled
in
the
soft
creamy
old
lace
which
covered
the
bosom
of
her
gown
there
was
a
quiet
strength
and
nobility
about
her
attitude
which
thrilled
the
soul
of
the
man
who
stood
watching
her
all
the
adoring
love
the
passion
of
worship
which
filled
his
heart
rose
to
his
eyes
and
shone
there
no
need
to
conceal
it
now
his
hour
had
come
at
last
and
he
had
nothing
to
hide
from
the
woman
he
loved
presently
she
turned
wondering
why
he
did
not
begin
his
confidences
about
pauline
lister
looking
up
inquiringly
she
met
his
eyes
dal
cried
jane
and
half
rose
from
her
seat
oh
dal
do
he
gently
pressed
her
back
hush
dear
he
said
i
must
tell
you
everything
and
you
have
promised
to
listen
and
to
advise
and
help
ah
jane
jane
i
shall
need
your
help
i
want
it
so
greatly
and
not
only
your
help
jane
but
you
you
yourself
ah
how
i
want
you
these
three
days
have
been
one
continual
ache
of
loneliness
because
you
were
not
there
and
life
began
to
live
and
move
again
when
you
returned
and
yet
it
has
been
so
hard
waiting
all
these
hours
to
speak
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
jane
of
all
you
are
to
me
all
you
have
become
to
me
since
the
night
of
the
concert
ah
how
can
i
express
it
i
have
never
had
any
big
things
in
my
life
all
has
been
more
or
less
trivial
on
the
surface
this
need
of
you
this
wanting
you
is
so
huge
it
dwarfs
all
that
went
before
it
would
overwhelm
all
that
is
to
come
were
it
not
that
it
will
be
the
throne
the
crown
the
summit
of
the
oh
jane
i
have
admired
so
many
women
i
have
raved
about
them
sighed
for
them
painted
them
and
forgotten
them
but
i
never
loved
a
woman
before
i
never
knew
what
womanhood
meant
to
a
man
until
i
heard
your
voice
thrill
through
the
stillness
count
each
pearl
ah
beloved
i
have
learned
to
count
pearls
since
then
precious
hours
in
the
past
long
forgotten
now
remembered
and
at
last
understood
hour
a
pearl
each
pearl
a
prayer
ay
a
passionate
plea
that
past
and
present
may
blend
together
into
a
perfect
rosary
and
that
the
future
may
hold
no
possibility
of
pain
or
parting
oh
jane
jane
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
make
you
understand
all
how
much
oh
jane
she
was
not
sure
just
when
he
had
come
so
near
but
he
had
dropped
on
one
knee
in
front
of
her
and
as
he
uttered
the
last
broken
sentences
he
passed
both
his
arms
around
her
waist
and
pressed
his
face
into
the
soft
lace
at
her
bosom
a
sudden
quietness
came
over
him
all
struggling
with
explanations
seemed
hushed
into
the
silence
of
complete
comprehension
an
enveloping
silence
jane
neither
moved
nor
spoke
it
was
so
strangely
sweet
to
have
him
there
this
whirlwind
of
emotion
come
home
to
rest
in
a
great
stillness
just
above
her
quiet
heart
suddenly
she
realised
that
the
blank
of
the
last
three
days
had
not
been
the
miss
of
the
music
but
the
miss
of
him
and
as
she
realised
this
she
unconsciously
put
her
arms
about
him
sensations
unknown
to
her
before
awoke
and
moved
within
her
a
heavenly
sense
of
aloofness
from
the
world
the
loneliness
of
life
all
swept
away
by
this
dear
fact
just
he
and
she
together
even
as
she
thought
it
felt
it
he
lifted
his
head
still
holding
her
and
looking
into
her
face
said
you
and
i
together
my
own
my
own
but
those
beautiful
shining
eyes
were
more
than
jane
could
bear
the
sense
of
her
plainness
smote
her
even
in
that
moment
and
those
adoring
eyes
seemed
lights
that
revealed
it
with
no
thought
in
her
mind
but
to
hide
the
outward
part
from
him
who
had
suddenly
come
so
close
to
the
shrine
within
she
quickly
put
both
hands
behind
his
head
and
pressed
his
face
down
again
into
the
lace
at
her
bosom
but
to
him
those
dear
firm
hands
holding
him
close
by
that
sudden
movement
seemed
an
acceptance
of
himself
and
of
all
he
had
to
offer
for
ten
twenty
thirty
exquisite
seconds
his
soul
throbbed
in
silence
and
rapture
beyond
words
then
he
broke
from
the
pressure
of
those
restraining
hands
lifted
his
head
and
looked
into
her
face
once
more
my
wife
he
said
into
jane
honest
face
came
a
look
of
startled
wonder
then
a
deep
flush
seeming
to
draw
all
the
blood
which
had
throbbed
so
strangely
through
her
heart
into
her
cheeks
making
them
burn
and
her
heart
die
within
her
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
hold
rose
and
stood
looking
away
to
where
the
still
waters
of
the
lake
gleamed
silver
in
the
moonlight
garth
dalmain
stood
beside
her
he
did
not
touch
her
nor
did
he
speak
again
he
felt
sure
he
had
won
and
his
whole
soul
was
filled
with
a
gladness
unspeakable
his
spirit
was
content
the
intense
silence
seemed
more
expressive
than
words
any
ordinary
touch
would
have
dimmed
the
sense
of
those
moments
when
her
hands
had
held
him
to
her
so
he
stood
quite
still
and
waited
at
last
jane
spoke
do
you
mean
that
you
wish
to
ask
me
to
be
to
be
that
to
you
yes
dear
he
answered
gently
but
in
his
voice
vibrated
the
quiet
of
strong
at
least
i
came
out
here
intending
to
ask
it
of
you
but
i
can
not
ask
it
now
beloved
i
ca
ask
you
to
be
what
you
are
already
no
promise
no
ceremony
no
giving
or
receiving
of
a
ring
could
make
you
more
my
wife
than
you
have
been
just
now
in
those
wonderful
moments
jane
slowly
turned
and
looked
at
him
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
radiant
as
his
face
but
still
those
shining
eyes
smote
her
like
swords
she
longed
to
cover
them
with
her
hands
or
bid
him
look
away
over
the
woods
and
water
while
he
went
on
saying
these
sweet
things
to
her
she
put
up
one
foot
on
the
low
parapet
leaned
her
elbow
on
her
knee
and
shielded
her
face
with
her
hand
then
she
answered
him
trying
to
speak
calmly
you
have
taken
me
absolutely
by
surprise
dal
i
knew
you
had
been
delightfully
nice
and
attentive
since
the
concert
evening
and
that
our
mutual
understanding
of
music
and
pleasure
in
it
coupled
with
an
increased
intimacy
brought
about
by
our
confidential
conversation
under
the
cedar
had
resulted
in
an
unusually
close
and
delightful
friendship
i
honestly
admit
it
seems
to
have
it
has
meant
more
to
me
than
any
friendship
has
ever
meant
but
that
was
partly
owing
to
your
temperament
dal
which
tends
to
make
you
always
the
most
vivid
spot
in
one
mental
landscape
but
truly
i
thought
you
wanted
me
out
here
in
order
to
pour
out
confidences
about
pauline
lister
everybody
believes
that
her
loveliness
has
effected
your
final
capture
and
truly
dal
truly
i
thought
so
too
jane
paused
well
said
the
quiet
voice
with
its
deep
undertone
of
gladness
you
know
otherwise
now
dal
you
have
so
startled
and
astonished
me
i
can
not
give
you
an
answer
you
must
let
me
have
until
morning
but
beloved
he
said
tenderly
moving
a
little
nearer
there
is
no
more
need
for
you
to
answer
than
i
felt
need
to
put
a
question
you
realise
this
question
and
answer
were
asked
and
given
just
now
oh
my
dearest
come
back
to
me
sit
down
again
but
jane
stood
rigid
no
she
said
i
ca
allow
you
to
take
things
for
granted
in
this
way
you
took
me
by
surprise
and
i
lost
my
head
utterly
unpardonably
i
admit
but
my
dear
boy
marriage
is
a
serious
thing
marriage
is
not
a
mere
question
of
sentiment
it
has
to
wear
it
has
to
last
it
must
have
a
solid
and
dependable
foundation
to
stand
the
test
and
strain
of
daily
life
together
i
know
so
many
married
couples
intimately
i
stay
in
their
homes
and
act
sponsor
to
their
children
with
the
result
that
i
vowed
never
to
risk
it
myself
and
now
i
have
let
you
put
this
question
and
you
must
not
wonder
if
i
ask
for
twelve
hours
to
think
it
over
garth
took
this
silently
he
sat
down
on
the
stone
coping
with
his
back
to
the
lake
and
leaning
backward
tried
to
see
her
face
but
the
hand
completely
screened
it
he
crossed
his
knees
and
clasped
both
hands
around
them
rocking
slightly
backward
and
forward
for
a
minute
while
mastering
the
impulse
to
speak
or
act
violently
he
strove
to
compose
his
mind
by
fixing
it
upon
trivial
details
which
chanced
to
catch
his
eye
his
red
socks
showed
clearly
in
the
moonlight
against
the
white
paving
of
the
terrace
and
looked
well
with
black
shoes
he
resolved
always
to
wear
red
silk
socks
in
the
evening
and
wondered
whether
jane
would
knit
some
for
him
he
counted
the
windows
along
the
front
of
the
house
noting
which
were
his
and
which
were
jane
and
how
many
came
between
at
last
he
knew
he
could
trust
himself
and
leaning
back
spoke
very
gently
his
dark
head
almost
touching
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
dearest
tell
me
did
you
feel
just
now
oh
hush
cried
jane
almost
harshly
hush
dal
do
talk
about
feelings
with
this
question
between
us
marriage
is
fact
not
feeling
if
you
want
to
do
really
the
best
thing
for
us
both
go
straight
indoors
now
and
do
speak
to
me
again
i
heard
you
say
you
were
going
to
try
the
organ
in
the
church
on
the
common
at
eleven
morning
well
i
will
come
there
soon
after
eleven
and
listen
while
you
play
and
at
noon
you
can
send
away
the
blower
and
i
will
give
you
my
answer
but
now
oh
go
away
dear
for
truly
i
can
not
bear
anymore
i
must
be
left
alone
garth
loosed
the
strong
fingers
clasped
so
tightly
round
his
knee
he
slipped
the
hand
next
to
her
along
the
stone
coping
close
to
her
foot
she
felt
him
take
hold
of
her
gown
with
those
deft
masterful
fingers
then
he
bent
his
dark
head
quickly
and
whispering
i
kiss
the
cross
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
reverence
and
tenderness
which
jane
never
forgot
he
kissed
the
hem
of
her
skirt
the
next
moment
she
was
alone
she
listened
while
his
footsteps
died
away
she
heard
the
door
into
the
lower
hall
open
and
close
then
slowly
she
sat
down
just
as
she
had
sat
when
he
knelt
in
front
of
her
now
she
was
quite
alone
the
tension
of
these
last
hard
moments
relaxed
she
pressed
both
hands
over
the
lace
at
her
bosom
where
that
dear
beautiful
adoring
face
had
been
hidden
had
she
felt
he
asked
ah
what
had
she
not
felt
tears
never
came
easily
to
jane
but
she
had
been
called
a
name
by
which
she
had
never
thought
to
be
called
and
already
her
honest
heart
was
telling
her
she
would
never
be
called
by
it
again
and
large
silent
tears
overflowed
and
fell
upon
her
hands
and
upon
the
lace
at
her
breast
for
the
wife
and
the
mother
in
her
had
been
wakened
and
stirred
and
the
deeps
of
her
nature
broke
through
the
barriers
of
stern
repression
and
almost
masculine
and
refused
to
be
driven
back
without
the
womanly
tribute
of
tears
and
around
her
feet
lay
the
scattered
petals
of
crushed
rambler
roses
presently
she
passed
indoors
the
upper
hall
was
filled
with
merry
groups
and
resounded
with
as
the
women
mounted
the
great
staircase
pausing
to
fling
back
final
repartees
or
to
confirm
plans
for
the
morrow
garth
dalmain
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
held
in
conversation
by
pauline
lister
and
her
aunt
who
had
turned
on
the
fourth
step
jane
saw
his
slim
erect
figure
and
glossy
head
the
moment
she
entered
the
hall
his
back
was
towards
her
and
though
she
advanced
and
stood
quite
near
he
gave
no
sign
of
being
aware
of
her
presence
but
the
joyousness
of
his
voice
seemed
to
make
him
hers
again
in
this
new
sweet
way
she
alone
knew
what
had
caused
it
and
unconsciously
she
put
one
hand
over
her
bosom
as
she
listened
sorry
dear
ladies
garth
was
saying
but
morning
is
impossible
i
have
an
engagement
in
the
village
yes
really
at
eleven
that
sounds
so
rural
and
pretty
dalmain
said
parker
bangs
why
not
take
pauline
and
me
along
we
have
seen
no
dairies
and
no
nor
any
of
the
things
in
adam
bede
since
we
came
over
i
would
just
love
to
step
into
poyser
kitchen
and
see
myself
reflected
in
the
on
the
walls
perhaps
we
would
be
de
trop
in
the
dairy
murmured
miss
lister
archly
she
looked
very
lovely
in
her
satin
gown
her
small
head
held
regally
the
brilliant
charm
of
american
womanhood
radiating
from
her
she
wore
no
jewels
save
one
string
of
perfectly
matched
pearls
but
on
pauline
lister
neck
even
pearls
seemed
to
sparkle
all
these
scintillations
flung
at
garth
passed
over
his
sleek
head
and
reached
jane
where
she
lingered
in
the
background
she
took
in
every
detail
never
had
miss
lister
loveliness
been
more
correctly
appraised
but
it
happens
unfortunately
to
be
neither
a
nor
a
said
garth
my
appointment
is
with
a
very
grubby
small
boy
whose
rural
beauties
consist
in
a
shock
of
red
hair
and
a
whole
of
freckles
philanthropic
inquired
miss
lister
yes
at
the
rate
of
threepence
an
hour
a
caddy
of
course
cried
both
ladies
together
my
what
a
mystery
about
a
thing
so
simple
added
parker
bangs
now
we
have
heard
dalmain
that
it
is
well
worth
the
walk
to
the
links
to
see
you
play
so
you
may
expect
us
to
arrive
there
time
to
see
you
start
around
garth
eyes
twinkled
jane
could
hear
the
twinkle
in
his
voice
my
dear
lady
he
said
you
overestimate
my
play
as
in
your
great
kindness
of
heart
you
overestimate
many
other
things
connected
with
me
but
i
shall
like
to
think
of
you
at
the
golf
links
at
eleven
morning
you
might
drive
there
but
the
walk
through
the
woods
is
too
charming
to
miss
only
remember
you
cross
the
park
and
leave
by
the
north
gate
not
the
main
entrance
by
which
we
go
to
the
railway
station
i
would
offer
to
escort
you
but
duty
takes
me
at
an
early
hour
in
quite
another
direction
besides
when
miss
wish
to
see
the
links
is
known
so
many
people
will
discover
golf
to
be
the
one
possible
way
of
spending
morning
that
i
should
be
but
a
unit
in
the
crowd
which
will
troop
across
the
park
to
the
north
gate
it
will
be
quite
impossible
for
you
to
miss
your
way
parker
bangs
was
beginning
to
explain
elaborately
that
never
under
any
circumstances
could
he
be
a
unit
when
her
niece
peremptorily
interposed
that
will
do
aunt
do
be
silly
we
are
all
units
except
when
we
make
a
crowd
which
is
what
we
are
doing
on
this
staircase
at
this
present
moment
so
that
miss
champion
has
for
some
time
been
trying
ineffectually
to
pass
us
do
you
golf
miss
champion
garth
stood
on
one
side
and
jane
began
to
mount
the
stairs
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
it
seemed
to
jane
that
his
eyes
were
on
the
hem
of
her
gown
as
it
trailed
past
him
she
paused
beside
miss
lister
she
knew
exactly
how
effectual
a
foil
she
made
to
the
american
girl
white
loveliness
she
turned
and
faced
him
she
wished
him
to
look
up
and
see
them
standing
there
together
she
wanted
the
artist
eyes
to
take
in
the
cruel
contrast
she
wanted
the
artist
soul
of
him
to
realise
it
she
waited
garth
eyes
were
still
on
the
hem
of
her
gown
close
to
the
left
foot
but
he
lifted
them
slowly
to
the
lace
at
her
bosom
where
her
hand
still
lay
there
they
rested
a
moment
then
dropped
again
without
rising
higher
yes
said
parker
bangs
are
you
playing
around
with
dalmain
forenoon
miss
champion
jane
suddenly
flushed
crimson
and
then
was
furious
with
herself
for
blushing
and
hated
the
circumstances
which
made
her
feel
and
act
so
unlike
her
ordinary
self
she
hesitated
during
the
long
dreadful
moment
how
dared
garth
behave
in
that
way
people
would
think
there
was
something
unusual
about
her
gown
she
felt
a
wild
impulse
to
stoop
and
look
at
it
herself
to
see
whether
his
kiss
had
materialised
and
was
hanging
like
a
star
to
the
silken
hem
then
she
forced
herself
to
calmness
and
answered
rather
brusquely
i
am
not
golfing
but
you
could
not
do
better
than
go
to
the
links
parker
bangs
sleep
well
miss
lister
dal
garth
was
on
the
step
below
them
handing
pauline
aunt
a
letter
she
had
dropped
miss
champion
he
said
and
for
one
instant
his
eyes
met
hers
but
he
did
not
hold
out
his
hand
or
appear
to
see
hers
half
extended
the
three
women
mounted
the
staircase
together
then
went
different
ways
miss
lister
trailed
away
down
a
passage
to
the
right
her
aunt
trotting
in
her
wake
there
been
a
tiff
there
said
parker
bangs
poor
thing
said
miss
lister
softly
i
like
her
she
a
real
good
sort
i
should
have
thought
she
would
have
been
more
sensible
than
the
rest
of
us
a
real
plain
sort
said
her
aunt
ignoring
the
last
sentence
well
she
did
make
her
own
face
said
miss
lister
generously
no
and
she
do
pay
other
people
to
make
it
for
her
she
what
sir
walter
scott
calls
in
all
its
ruggedness
dear
aunt
remarked
miss
lister
wearily
i
wish
you
would
trouble
to
quote
the
english
classics
to
me
when
we
are
alone
it
is
pure
waste
of
breath
because
you
see
i
know
you
have
read
them
all
here
is
my
door
now
come
right
in
and
make
yourself
comfy
on
that
couch
i
am
going
to
sit
in
this
palatial
opposite
and
do
a
little
very
needful
explaining
my
how
they
fix
one
to
the
floor
these
ancestral
castles
are
all
right
so
far
as
they
go
but
they
do
know
a
thing
about
rockers
now
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
miss
champion
she
a
real
good
sort
and
i
like
her
she
not
a
beauty
but
she
has
a
fine
figure
and
she
dresses
right
she
has
heaps
of
money
and
could
have
rarer
pearls
than
mine
but
she
knows
better
than
to
put
pearls
on
that
brown
skin
i
like
a
woman
who
knows
her
limitations
and
is
sensible
over
them
all
the
men
adore
her
not
for
what
she
looks
but
for
what
she
is
and
my
word
aunt
that
what
pays
in
the
long
run
that
is
what
lasts
ten
years
hence
the
honourable
jane
will
still
be
what
she
is
and
i
shall
be
trying
to
look
what
i
not
as
for
garth
dalmain
he
has
eyes
for
all
of
us
and
a
heart
for
none
his
pretty
speeches
and
admiring
looks
do
mean
marriage
because
he
is
a
man
with
an
ideal
of
womanhood
and
he
ca
see
himself
marrying
below
it
if
the
sistine
madonna
could
step
down
off
those
clouds
and
hand
the
infant
to
the
young
woman
on
her
left
he
might
marry
her
but
even
then
he
would
be
afraid
he
might
see
some
one
next
day
who
did
her
hair
more
becomingly
or
that
her
foot
would
not
look
so
well
on
his
persian
rugs
as
it
does
on
that
cloud
he
wo
marry
money
because
he
has
plenty
of
it
and
even
if
he
had
money
made
in
candles
would
not
appeal
to
him
he
wo
marry
beauty
because
he
thinks
too
much
about
it
he
adores
so
many
lovely
faces
that
he
is
never
sure
for
hours
which
of
them
he
admires
most
bar
the
fact
that
as
in
the
case
of
fruit
trees
the
unattainable
are
usually
the
most
desired
he
wo
marry
goodness
virtue
worth
whatever
you
choose
to
call
the
sterling
qualities
of
character
because
in
all
these
the
honourable
jane
champion
is
his
ideal
and
she
is
too
sensible
a
woman
to
tie
such
an
epicure
to
her
plain
face
besides
she
considers
herself
his
grandmother
and
does
require
him
to
teach
her
to
suck
eggs
but
garth
dalmain
poor
boy
is
so
sublimely
lacking
in
that
he
never
questions
whether
he
can
win
his
ideal
he
possesses
her
already
in
his
soul
and
it
will
be
a
fearful
smack
in
the
face
when
she
says
as
she
assuredly
will
do
for
reasons
aforesaid
these
three
days
while
he
has
been
playing
around
with
me
and
you
and
other
dear
old
donkeys
have
gambolled
about
us
and
made
sure
we
were
falling
in
love
he
has
been
worshipping
the
ground
she
walks
on
and
counting
the
hours
until
he
should
see
her
walk
on
it
again
he
enjoyed
being
with
me
more
than
with
the
other
girls
because
i
understood
and
helped
him
to
work
all
conversations
round
to
her
and
he
knew
when
she
arrived
here
i
could
be
trusted
to
develop
sudden
anxiety
about
you
or
have
important
letters
to
write
if
she
came
in
sight
but
that
is
all
there
will
ever
be
between
me
and
garth
dalmain
and
if
you
had
a
really
careful
regard
for
my
young
affections
you
would
drop
your
false
set
on
the
marble
or
devise
some
other
equally
false
excuse
for
our
immediate
departure
for
town
and
now
dear
do
stay
to
argue
because
i
have
said
exactly
all
there
is
to
say
on
the
subject
and
a
little
more
and
try
to
toddle
to
bed
without
telling
me
of
which
cute
character
in
dickens
i
remind
you
because
i
am
cuter
than
any
of
them
and
if
i
stay
in
this
tight
frock
another
second
i
ca
answer
for
the
oui
josephine
entrez
dear
aunt
happy
dreams
but
after
her
maid
had
left
her
pauline
switched
off
the
electric
light
and
drawing
back
the
curtain
stood
for
a
long
while
at
her
window
looking
out
at
the
peaceful
english
scene
bathed
in
moonlight
at
last
she
murmured
softly
leaning
her
beautiful
head
against
the
window
frame
i
stated
your
case
well
but
you
did
quite
deserve
it
dal
you
ought
to
have
let
me
know
about
jane
weeks
ago
anyway
it
will
stop
the
talk
about
you
and
me
and
as
for
you
dear
you
will
go
on
sighing
for
the
moon
and
when
you
find
the
moon
is
unattainable
you
will
not
dream
of
seeking
solace
in
more
earthly
lights
not
even
poppa
best
sperm
she
added
with
a
wistful
little
smile
for
pauline
fun
sparkled
in
solitude
as
freely
as
in
company
and
as
often
at
her
own
expense
as
at
that
of
other
people
and
her
brave
american
spirit
would
not
admit
even
to
herself
a
serious
hurt
meanwhile
jane
had
turned
to
the
left
and
passed
slowly
to
her
room
garth
had
not
taken
her
hand
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
why
he
would
never
again
be
content
to
clasp
her
hand
in
friendship
if
she
cut
him
off
from
the
touch
which
meant
absolute
possession
she
cut
herself
off
from
the
contact
of
simple
comradeship
garth
was
like
a
royal
tiger
who
had
tasted
blood
it
seemed
a
queer
simile
as
she
thought
of
him
in
his
conventional
evening
clothes
correct
in
every
line
smart
almost
to
a
fault
but
out
on
the
terrace
with
him
she
had
realised
for
the
first
time
the
primal
elements
which
go
to
the
making
of
a
man
a
forceful
determined
ruling
man
creation
king
they
echo
of
primeval
forests
the
roar
of
the
lion
is
in
them
the
fierceness
of
the
tiger
the
instinct
of
dominant
possession
which
says
mine
to
have
and
hold
to
fight
for
and
enjoy
and
i
slay
all
comers
she
had
felt
it
and
her
own
brave
soul
had
understood
it
and
responded
to
it
unafraid
and
been
ready
to
mate
with
it
if
only
ah
if
only
but
things
could
never
be
again
as
they
had
been
before
if
she
meant
to
starve
her
tiger
steel
bars
must
be
between
them
for
evermore
none
of
those
sentimental
suggestions
of
attempts
to
be
a
sort
of
unsatisfactory
cross
between
sister
and
friend
would
do
for
the
man
whose
head
she
had
unconsciously
held
against
her
breast
jane
knew
this
he
had
kept
himself
magnificently
in
hand
after
she
put
him
from
her
but
she
knew
he
was
only
giving
her
breathing
space
he
still
considered
her
his
own
and
his
very
certainty
of
the
near
future
had
given
him
that
gentle
patience
in
the
present
but
even
now
while
her
answer
pended
he
would
not
take
her
hand
in
friendship
jane
closed
her
door
and
locked
it
she
must
face
this
problem
of
the
future
with
all
else
locked
out
excepting
herself
and
him
ah
if
she
could
but
lock
herself
out
and
think
only
of
him
and
of
his
love
as
beautiful
perfect
gifts
laid
at
her
feet
that
she
might
draw
them
up
into
her
empty
arms
and
clasp
them
there
for
evermore
just
for
a
little
while
she
would
do
this
one
hour
of
realisation
was
her
right
afterwards
she
must
bring
herself
into
the
problem
her
possibilities
her
limitations
herself
in
her
relation
to
him
in
the
future
in
the
effect
marriage
with
her
would
be
likely
to
have
upon
him
what
it
might
mean
to
her
did
not
consciously
enter
into
her
calculations
jane
was
with
the
intense
of
all
reserved
natures
but
she
was
not
selfish
at
first
then
she
left
her
room
in
darkness
and
groping
her
way
to
the
curtains
drew
them
back
threw
up
the
sash
and
drawing
a
chair
to
the
window
sat
down
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
sill
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
looked
down
upon
the
terrace
still
bathed
in
moonlight
her
window
was
almost
opposite
the
place
where
she
and
garth
had
talked
she
could
see
the
stone
lion
and
the
vase
full
of
scarlet
geraniums
she
could
locate
the
exact
spot
where
she
was
sitting
when
he
memory
awoke
vibrant
then
jane
allowed
herself
the
most
wonderful
mental
experience
of
her
life
she
was
a
woman
of
purpose
and
decision
she
had
said
she
had
a
right
to
that
hour
and
she
took
it
to
the
full
in
soul
she
met
her
tiger
and
mated
with
him
unafraid
he
had
not
asked
whether
she
loved
him
or
not
and
she
did
not
need
to
ask
herself
she
surrendered
her
proud
liberty
and
tenderly
humbly
wistfully
yet
with
all
the
strength
of
her
strong
nature
promised
to
love
honour
and
obey
him
she
met
the
adoration
of
his
splendid
eyes
without
a
tremor
she
had
locked
her
body
out
she
was
alone
with
her
soul
and
her
soul
was
perfect
for
him
the
loneliness
of
years
slipped
from
her
life
became
rich
and
purposeful
he
needed
her
always
and
she
was
always
there
and
always
able
to
meet
his
need
are
you
content
my
beloved
she
asked
over
and
over
and
garth
joyous
voice
with
the
ring
of
perpetual
youth
in
it
always
answered
perfectly
content
and
jane
smiled
into
the
night
and
in
the
depths
of
her
calm
eyes
dawned
a
knowledge
hitherto
unknown
and
in
her
tender
smile
trembled
with
unspeakable
sweetness
an
understanding
of
the
secret
of
a
woman
truest
bliss
he
is
mine
and
i
am
his
and
because
he
is
mine
my
beloved
is
safe
and
because
i
am
his
he
is
content
thus
she
gave
herself
completely
gathering
him
into
the
shelter
of
her
love
and
her
generous
heart
expanded
to
the
greatness
of
the
gift
then
the
mother
in
her
awoke
and
realised
how
much
of
the
maternal
flows
into
the
love
of
a
true
woman
when
she
understands
how
largely
the
predominates
in
the
man
in
love
and
how
the
very
strength
of
his
need
of
her
reduces
to
unaccustomed
weakness
the
strong
nature
to
which
she
has
become
essential
jane
pressed
her
hands
upon
her
breast
garth
she
whispered
garth
i
understand
my
own
poor
boy
it
was
so
hard
to
you
to
be
sent
away
just
then
but
you
had
had
all
all
you
wanted
in
those
few
wonderful
moments
and
nothing
can
rob
you
of
that
fact
and
you
have
made
me
so
yours
that
whatever
the
future
brings
for
you
and
me
no
other
face
will
ever
be
hidden
here
it
is
yours
and
i
am
yours
and
henceforward
forever
jane
leaned
her
forehead
on
the
the
moonlight
fell
on
the
heavy
coils
of
her
brown
hair
the
scent
of
the
magnolia
blooms
rose
in
fragrance
around
her
the
song
of
a
nightingale
purled
and
thrilled
in
an
adjacent
wood
the
lonely
years
of
the
past
the
perplexing
moments
of
the
present
the
uncertain
vistas
of
the
future
all
rolled
away
she
sailed
with
garth
upon
a
golden
ocean
far
removed
from
the
shores
of
time
for
love
is
eternal
and
the
birth
of
love
frees
the
spirit
from
all
limitations
of
the
flesh
a
clock
in
the
distant
village
struck
midnight
the
twelve
strokes
floated
up
to
jane
window
across
the
moonlit
park
time
was
once
more
her
freed
spirit
resumed
the
burden
of
the
body
a
new
day
had
begun
the
day
upon
which
she
had
promised
her
answer
to
garth
the
next
time
that
clock
struck
twelve
she
would
be
standing
with
him
in
the
church
and
her
answer
must
be
ready
she
turned
from
the
window
without
closing
it
drew
the
curtains
closely
across
switched
on
the
electric
light
over
the
took
off
her
evening
gown
hung
up
bodice
and
skirt
in
the
wardrobe
resolutely
locking
the
door
upon
them
then
she
slipped
on
a
wrapper
which
she
had
lately
purchased
at
a
bazaar
because
every
one
else
fled
from
it
and
the
old
lady
whose
handiwork
it
was
seemed
so
disappointed
and
drawing
a
chair
near
the
took
out
her
diary
unlocked
the
heavy
clasp
and
began
to
read
she
turned
the
pages
slowly
pausing
here
and
there
until
she
came
to
those
she
sought
over
them
she
pondered
long
her
head
in
her
hands
they
contained
a
very
full
account
of
her
conversation
with
garth
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
of
the
concert
at
overdene
and
the
lines
upon
which
she
specially
dwelt
were
these
his
face
was
transfigured
goodness
and
inspiration
shone
from
it
making
it
as
the
face
of
an
angel
i
never
thought
him
ugly
again
child
though
i
was
i
could
differentiate
even
then
between
ugliness
and
plainness
i
have
associated
his
face
ever
since
with
the
wondrous
beauty
of
his
soul
when
he
sat
down
at
the
close
of
his
address
i
no
longer
thought
him
a
complicated
form
of
chimpanzee
i
remembered
the
divine
halo
of
his
smile
of
course
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
could
have
wanted
to
live
with
or
to
have
day
after
day
opposite
one
at
table
but
then
one
was
not
called
to
that
sort
of
discipline
which
would
have
been
martyrdom
to
me
and
he
has
always
stood
to
my
mind
since
as
a
proof
of
the
truth
that
goodness
is
never
ugly
and
that
divine
love
and
aspiration
shining
through
the
plainest
features
may
redeem
them
temporarily
into
beauty
and
permanently
into
a
thing
one
loves
to
remember
at
first
jane
read
the
entire
passage
then
her
mind
focussed
itself
upon
one
sentence
of
course
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
could
have
wanted
to
live
with
or
to
have
day
after
day
opposite
one
at
table
which
would
have
been
martyrdom
to
me
at
length
jane
arose
turned
on
all
the
lights
over
the
particularly
two
bright
ones
on
either
side
of
the
mirror
and
sitting
down
before
it
faced
herself
honestly
when
the
village
clock
struck
one
garth
dalmain
stood
at
his
window
taking
a
final
look
at
the
night
which
had
meant
so
much
to
him
he
remembered
with
an
amused
smile
how
to
help
himself
to
calmness
he
had
sat
on
the
terrace
and
thought
of
his
socks
and
then
had
counted
the
windows
between
his
and
jane
there
were
five
of
them
he
knew
her
window
by
the
magnolia
tree
and
the
seat
beneath
it
where
he
had
chanced
to
sit
not
knowing
she
was
above
him
he
leaned
far
out
and
looked
towards
it
now
the
curtains
were
drawn
but
there
appeared
still
to
be
a
light
behind
them
even
as
he
watched
it
went
out
he
looked
down
at
the
terrace
he
could
see
the
stone
lion
and
the
vase
of
scarlet
geraniums
he
could
locate
the
exact
spot
where
she
was
sitting
when
he
then
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
beside
the
window
and
looked
up
into
the
starry
sky
garth
mother
had
lived
long
enough
to
teach
him
the
holy
secret
of
her
sweet
patience
and
endurance
in
moments
of
deep
feeling
words
from
his
mother
bible
came
to
his
lips
more
readily
than
expressions
of
his
own
thought
now
looking
upward
he
repeated
softly
and
reverently
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
with
whom
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
of
turning
and
oh
father
he
added
keep
us
in
the
light
she
and
i
may
there
be
in
us
as
there
is
in
thee
no
variableness
neither
shadow
which
is
cast
by
turning
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
across
once
more
to
the
stone
lion
and
the
broad
coping
his
soul
sang
within
him
and
he
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
my
wife
he
said
oh
my
wife
and
as
the
village
clock
struck
one
jane
arrived
at
her
decision
slowly
she
rose
and
turned
off
all
the
lights
then
groping
her
way
to
the
bed
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
it
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
desperate
silent
weeping
chapter
xi
garth
finds
the
cross
the
village
church
on
the
green
was
bathed
in
sunshine
as
jane
emerged
from
the
cool
shade
of
the
park
the
clock
proclaimed
the
hour
eleven
and
jane
did
not
hasten
knowing
she
was
not
expected
until
twelve
the
windows
of
the
church
were
open
and
the
massive
oaken
doors
stood
ajar
jane
paused
beneath
the
porch
and
stood
listening
the
tones
of
the
organ
reached
her
as
from
an
immense
distance
and
yet
with
an
nearness
the
sound
was
disassociated
from
hands
and
feet
the
organ
seemed
breathing
and
its
breath
was
music
jane
pushed
the
heavy
door
further
open
and
even
at
that
moment
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
freckled
boy
with
a
red
head
and
garth
slim
proportions
had
evidently
passed
easily
through
an
aperture
which
refused
ingress
to
her
more
massive
figure
she
pushed
the
door
further
open
and
went
in
instantly
a
stillness
entered
into
her
soul
the
sense
of
unseen
presences
often
so
strongly
felt
on
entering
an
empty
church
alone
the
impress
left
upon
old
walls
and
rafters
by
the
worshipping
minds
of
centuries
hushed
the
insistent
beating
of
her
own
perplexity
and
for
a
few
moments
she
forgot
the
errand
which
brought
her
there
and
bowed
her
head
in
unison
with
the
worship
of
ages
garth
was
playing
the
veni
creator
spiritus
to
attwood
perfect
setting
and
as
jane
walked
noiselessly
up
to
the
chancel
he
began
to
sing
the
words
of
the
second
verse
he
sang
them
softly
but
his
beautifully
modulated
barytone
carried
well
and
every
syllable
reached
her
enable
with
perpetual
light
the
dulness
of
our
blinded
sight
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
with
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
then
the
organ
swelled
into
full
power
pealing
out
the
theme
of
the
last
verse
without
its
words
and
allowing
those
he
had
sung
to
repeat
themselves
over
and
over
in
jane
mind
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
had
she
not
prayed
for
guidance
then
surely
all
would
be
well
she
paused
at
the
entrance
to
the
chancel
garth
had
returned
to
the
second
verse
and
was
singing
again
to
a
waldflute
accompaniment
enable
with
perpetual
light
jane
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
old
oak
stalls
and
looked
around
her
the
brilliant
sunshine
from
without
entered
through
the
windows
mellowed
into
golden
beams
of
soft
amber
light
with
here
and
there
a
shaft
of
crimson
what
a
beautiful
expression
perpetual
light
as
garth
sang
it
each
syllable
seemed
to
pierce
the
silence
like
a
ray
of
purest
sunlight
the
dulness
of
jane
could
just
see
the
top
of
his
dark
head
over
the
heavy
brocade
of
the
organ
curtain
she
dreaded
the
moment
when
he
should
turn
and
those
vivid
eyes
should
catch
sight
of
her
our
blinded
sight
how
would
he
take
what
she
must
say
would
she
have
strength
to
come
through
a
long
hard
scene
would
he
be
tragically
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
would
he
argue
and
insist
and
override
her
judgment
with
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
could
she
oppose
his
fierce
strength
if
he
chose
to
exert
it
would
they
either
of
them
come
through
so
hard
a
time
without
wounding
each
other
terribly
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
oh
what
could
she
say
what
would
he
say
how
should
she
answer
what
reason
could
she
give
for
her
refusal
which
garth
would
ever
take
as
final
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
and
then
after
a
few
soft
impromptu
chords
the
theme
changed
jane
heart
stood
still
garth
was
playing
the
rosary
he
did
not
sing
it
but
the
soft
insistence
of
the
organ
pipes
seemed
to
press
the
words
into
the
air
as
no
voice
could
have
done
memory
pearls
in
all
the
purity
of
their
gleaming
preciousness
were
counted
one
by
one
by
the
flute
and
dulciana
and
the
sadder
tones
of
the
waldflute
proclaimed
the
finding
of
the
cross
it
all
held
a
new
meaning
for
jane
who
looked
helplessly
round
as
if
seeking
some
way
of
escape
from
the
sad
sweetness
of
sound
which
filled
the
little
church
suddenly
it
ceased
garth
stood
up
turned
and
saw
her
the
glory
of
a
great
joy
leaped
into
his
face
all
right
jimmy
he
said
that
will
do
for
this
morning
and
here
is
a
bright
sixpence
because
you
have
managed
the
blowing
so
well
hullo
it
a
shilling
never
mind
you
shall
have
it
because
it
is
such
a
glorious
day
there
never
was
such
a
day
jimmy
and
i
want
you
to
be
happy
also
now
run
off
quickly
and
shut
the
church
door
behind
you
my
boy
ah
how
his
voice
with
its
ring
of
buoyant
gladness
shook
her
soul
the
boy
rather
grubby
with
a
whole
of
freckles
but
a
beaming
face
of
pleasure
came
out
from
behind
the
organ
clattered
down
a
side
aisle
dropped
his
shilling
on
the
way
and
had
to
find
it
but
at
last
went
out
the
heavy
door
closing
behind
him
with
a
resounding
clang
garth
had
remained
standing
beside
the
organ
quite
motionless
without
looking
at
jane
and
now
that
they
were
absolutely
alone
in
the
church
he
still
stood
and
waited
a
few
moments
to
jane
those
moments
seemed
days
weeks
years
an
eternity
then
he
came
out
into
the
centre
of
the
chancel
his
head
erect
his
eyes
shining
his
whole
bearing
that
of
a
conqueror
sure
of
his
victory
he
walked
down
to
the
quaintly
carved
oaken
screen
and
passing
beneath
it
stood
at
the
step
then
he
signed
to
jane
to
come
and
stand
beside
him
here
dearest
he
said
let
it
be
here
jane
came
to
him
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
together
looking
up
the
chancel
it
was
darker
than
the
rest
of
the
church
being
lighted
only
by
three
narrow
windows
gems
of
colour
and
of
significance
the
centre
window
immediately
over
the
communion
table
represented
the
saviour
of
the
world
dying
upon
the
cross
they
gazed
at
it
in
reverent
silence
then
garth
turned
to
jane
my
beloved
he
said
it
is
a
sacred
presence
and
a
sacred
place
but
no
place
could
be
too
sacred
for
that
which
we
have
to
say
to
each
other
and
the
holy
presence
in
which
we
both
believe
is
here
to
bless
and
ratify
it
i
am
waiting
for
your
answer
jane
cleared
her
throat
and
put
her
trembling
hands
into
the
large
pockets
of
her
tweed
coat
dal
she
said
my
answer
is
a
question
how
old
are
you
she
felt
his
start
of
intense
surprise
she
saw
the
light
of
expectant
joy
fade
from
his
face
but
he
replied
after
only
a
momentary
hesitation
i
thought
you
knew
dearest
i
am
well
said
jane
slowly
and
deliberately
i
am
thirty
and
i
look
and
feel
forty
you
are
dal
and
you
look
nineteen
and
often
feel
nine
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
and
you
know
i
can
not
marry
a
mere
boy
silence
absolute
in
sheer
terror
jane
forced
herself
to
look
at
him
he
was
white
to
the
lips
his
face
was
very
stern
and
calm
a
strange
stony
calmness
there
was
not
much
youth
in
it
just
then
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
the
silent
church
seemed
to
wail
the
words
in
bewildered
agony
at
last
he
spoke
i
had
not
thought
of
myself
he
said
slowly
i
can
not
explain
how
it
comes
to
pass
but
i
have
not
thought
of
myself
at
all
since
my
mind
has
been
full
of
you
therefore
i
had
not
realised
how
little
there
is
in
me
that
you
could
care
for
i
believed
you
had
felt
as
i
did
that
we
were
just
each
other
for
a
moment
he
put
out
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
touched
her
then
it
dropped
heavily
to
his
side
you
are
quite
right
he
said
you
could
not
marry
any
one
whom
you
consider
a
mere
boy
he
turned
from
her
and
faced
up
the
chancel
for
the
space
of
a
long
silent
minute
he
looked
at
the
window
over
the
holy
table
where
hung
the
suffering
christ
then
he
bowed
his
head
i
accept
the
cross
he
said
and
turning
walked
quietly
down
the
aisle
the
church
door
opened
closed
behind
him
with
a
heavy
clang
and
jane
was
alone
she
stumbled
back
to
the
seat
she
had
left
and
fell
upon
her
knees
o
my
god
she
cried
send
him
back
to
me
oh
send
him
back
oh
garth
it
is
i
who
am
plain
and
unattractive
and
unworthy
not
you
oh
garth
come
back
come
back
come
back
i
will
trust
and
not
be
afraid
oh
my
own
dear
come
back
she
listened
with
straining
ears
she
waited
until
every
nerve
of
her
body
ached
with
suspense
she
decided
what
she
would
say
when
the
heavy
door
reopened
and
she
saw
garth
standing
in
a
shaft
of
sunlight
she
tried
to
remember
the
veni
but
the
hollow
clang
of
the
door
had
silenced
even
memory
echo
of
that
haunting
music
so
she
waited
silently
and
as
she
waited
the
silence
grew
and
seemed
to
enclose
her
within
cruel
relentless
walls
which
opened
only
to
allow
her
glimpses
into
the
vista
of
future
lonely
years
just
once
more
she
broke
that
silence
oh
darling
come
back
i
will
risk
it
she
said
but
no
step
drew
near
and
kneeling
with
her
face
buried
in
her
clasped
hands
jane
suddenly
realised
that
garth
dalmain
had
accepted
her
decision
as
final
and
irrevocable
and
would
not
return
how
long
she
knelt
there
after
realising
this
she
never
knew
but
at
last
comfort
came
to
her
she
felt
she
had
done
right
a
few
hours
of
present
anguish
were
better
than
years
of
future
disillusion
her
own
life
would
be
sadly
empty
and
losing
this
newly
found
joy
was
costing
her
more
than
she
had
expected
but
she
honestly
believed
she
had
done
rightly
towards
him
and
what
did
her
own
pain
matter
thus
comfort
came
to
jane
at
last
she
rose
and
passed
out
of
the
silent
church
into
the
breezy
sunshine
near
the
park
gates
a
little
knot
of
excited
boys
were
preparing
to
fly
a
kite
jimmy
the
hero
of
the
hour
the
centre
of
attraction
proved
to
be
the
proud
possessor
of
this
new
kite
jimmy
was
finding
the
day
glorious
indeed
and
was
being
happy
happy
also
garth
had
said
and
jane
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
remembered
the
word
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
spoken
there
goes
my
poor
boy
shilling
she
said
to
herself
sadly
as
the
kite
mounted
and
soared
above
the
common
but
alas
where
is
his
joy
as
she
passed
up
the
avenue
a
was
driven
swiftly
down
it
garth
dalmain
drove
it
behind
him
a
groom
and
a
portmanteau
he
lifted
his
hat
as
he
passed
her
but
looked
straight
before
him
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
had
jane
wanted
to
stop
him
she
could
not
have
done
so
but
she
did
not
want
to
stop
him
she
felt
absolutely
satisfied
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
and
done
it
at
greater
cost
to
herself
than
to
him
he
would
eventually
ah
perhaps
before
so
very
long
find
another
to
be
to
him
all
and
more
than
all
he
had
believed
she
could
be
but
she
the
dull
ache
at
her
bosom
reminded
her
of
her
own
words
the
night
before
whispered
in
the
secret
of
her
chamber
to
him
who
alas
was
not
there
to
hear
whatever
the
future
brings
for
you
and
me
no
other
face
will
ever
be
hidden
here
and
in
this
first
hour
of
the
coming
lonely
years
she
knew
them
to
be
true
in
the
hall
she
met
pauline
lister
is
that
you
miss
champion
said
pauline
well
now
have
you
heard
of
dalmain
he
has
had
to
go
to
town
unexpectedly
on
the
train
and
aunt
has
dropped
her
false
teeth
on
her
marble
and
must
get
to
the
dentist
right
away
so
we
go
to
town
on
the
it
an
uncertain
world
it
complicates
one
plans
when
they
have
to
depend
on
other
people
teeth
but
i
would
sooner
break
false
teeth
than
true
hearts
any
day
one
can
get
the
former
mended
but
i
guess
no
one
can
mend
the
latter
we
are
lunching
early
in
our
rooms
so
i
wish
you
miss

chapter
xii
the
doctor
prescription
the
honourable
jane
champion
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
great
pyramid
and
looked
around
her
the
four
exhausted
arabs
whose
exertions
combined
with
her
own
activity
had
placed
her
there
dropped
in
the
picturesque
attitudes
into
which
an
arab
falls
by
nature
they
had
hoisted
the
honourable
jane
eleven
stone
ten
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
in
record
time
and
now
lay
around
proud
of
their
achievement
and
sure
of
their
backsheesh
the
whole
thing
had
gone
as
if
by
two
finely
proportioned
fellows
in
scanty
white
garments
sprang
with
the
ease
of
antelopes
to
the
top
of
a
high
step
turning
to
reach
down
eagerly
and
seize
jane
upstretched
hands
one
remained
behind
unseen
but
indispensable
to
lend
timely
aid
at
exactly
the
right
moment
then
came
the
apparently
impossible
task
for
jane
of
placing
the
sole
of
her
foot
on
the
edge
of
a
stone
four
feet
above
the
one
upon
which
she
was
standing
it
seemed
rather
like
stepping
up
on
to
the
mantelpiece
but
encouraged
by
cries
of
eiwa
eiwa
she
did
it
when
instantly
a
voice
behind
said
tyeb
two
voices
above
shouted
keteer
the
grip
on
her
hands
tightened
the
arab
behind
hoisted
and
jane
had
stepped
up
with
an
ease
which
surprised
herself
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
those
circumstances
the
impossible
thing
would
have
been
not
to
have
stepped
up
arab
number
four
was
and
offered
water
from
a
gourd
at
intervals
and
once
when
jane
had
to
cry

for
a
few
breathing
space

of
all
and
leader
of
the
enterprise

his
jill
came
tumbling
after
jane
had
laughed
and
schehati
encouraged
by
the
success
of
his
attempt
to
edify
and
amuse
used
lines
of
the
immortal
nursery
epic
as
signals
for
united
action
during
the
remainder
of
the
climb
therefore
jane
mounted
one
step
to
the
fact
that
jack
fell
down
and
scaled
the
next
to
information
as
to
the
serious
nature
of
his
injuries
and
at
the
third

bending
over
confidentially
mentioned
in

ear
while
ali
shoved
behind
that
jill
came
tumbling
after
the
familiar
words
heard
under
such
novel
circumstances
took
on
fresh
meaning
jane
commenced
speculating
as
to
whether
the
downfall
of
jack
need
necessarily
have
caused
so
complete
a
loss
of
and
equilibrium
on
the
part
of
jill
would
she
not
have
proved
her
devotion
better
by
bringing
the
mutual
pail
safely
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
there
attending
to
the
wounds
of
her
fallen
hero
jane
in
her
time
had
witnessed
the
tragic
downfall
of
various
delightful
jacks
and
had
herself
ministered
tenderly
to
their
broken
crowns
for
in
each
case
the
jill
had
remained
on
the
top
of
the
hill
flirting
with
that
objectionable
person
of
the
name
of
horner
whose
cool
calculating
way
of
setting
to
work
so
unlike
poor
jack
headlong
method
invariably
secured
him
the
plum
upon
which
he
remarked
what
a
good
boy
am
i
and
was
usually
taken
at
his
own
smug
valuation
but
jane
entire
sympathy
on
these
occasions
was
with
the
defeated
lover
and
more
than
one
jack
was
now
on
his
feet
again
bravely
facing
life
because
that
kind
hand
had
been
held
out
to
him
as
he
lay
in
his
valley
of
humiliation
and
that
comprehending
sympathy
had
proved
balm
to
his
broken
crown

chanted
schehati
solemnly
as
he
hauled
again
moses
ran
up
the
clock
the
clock
struck
the
clock
struck
one
it
was
nearly
three
years
since
that
night
at
shenstone
when
the
clock
had
struck
one
and
jane
had
arrived
at
her
decision
the
decision
which
precipitated
her
jack
from
his
pisgah
of
future
promise
and
yet
no
he
had
not
fallen
before
the
blow
he
had
taken
it
erect
and
his
light
step
had
been
even
firmer
than
usual
as
he
walked
down
the
church
and
left
her
after
quietly
and
deliberately
accepting
her
decision
it
was
jane
herself
left
alone
who
fell
hopelessly
over
the
pail
she
shivered
even
now
when
she
remembered
how
its
icy
waters
drenched
her
heart
ah
what
would
have
happened
if
garth
had
come
back
in
answer
to
her
cry
during
those
first
moments
of
intolerable
suffering
and
loneliness
but
garth
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
when
a
door
has
been
shut
upon
him
waits
on
the
mat
outside
hoping
to
be
recalled
when
she
put
him
from
her
and
he
realised
that
she
meant
it
he
passed
completely
out
of
her
life
he
was
at
the
railway
station
by
the
time
she
reached
the
house
and
from
that
day
to
this
they
had
never
met
garth
evidently
considered
the
avoidance
of
meetings
to
be
his
responsibility
and
he
never
failed
her
in
this
once
or
twice
she
went
on
a
visit
to
houses
where
she
knew
him
to
be
staying
he
always
happened
to
have
left
that
morning
if
she
arrived
in
time
for
luncheon
or
by
an
early
afternoon
train
if
she
was
due
for
tea
he
never
timed
it
so
that
there
should
be
tragic
passings
of
each
other
with
set
faces
at
the
railway
stations
or
a
formal
word
of
greeting
as
she
arrived
and
he
departed
just
enough
to
awaken
all
the
slumbering
pain
and
set
people
wondering
jane
remembered
with
shame
that
this
was
the
sort
of
picturesque
tragedy
she
would
have
expected
from
garth
dalmain
but
the
man
who
had
surprised
her
by
his
dignified
acquiescence
in
her
decision
continued
to
surprise
her
by
the
strength
with
which
he
silently
accepted
it
as
final
and
kept
out
of
her
way
jane
had
not
probed
the
depth
of
the
wound
she
had
inflicted
never
once
was
his
departure
connected
in
the
minds
of
others
with
her
arrival
there
was
always
some
excellent
and
perfectly
natural
reason
why
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
and
he
was
openly
talked
of
and
regretted
and
jane
heard
all
the
latest
dal
stories
and
found
herself
surrounded
by
the
atmosphere
of
his
exotic
nature
and
there
was
usually
a
girl
always
the
loveliest
of
the
party
confidentially
pointed
out
to
jane
by
the
rest
as
a
certainty
if
only
dal
had
had
another
hours
of
her
society
but
the
girl
herself
would
appear
quite
only
very
full
of
an
evidently
delightful
friendship
expressing
all
dal
ideas
on
art
and
colour
as
her
own
and
confidently
happy
in
an
assured
sense
of
her
own
loveliness
and
charm
and
power
to
please
never
did
he
leave
behind
him
traces
which
the
woman
who
loved
him
regretted
to
find
but
he
was
always
gone
irrevocably
gone
garth
dalmain
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
wait
on
the
of
a
woman
indecision
neither
did
this
jack
of
hers
break
his
crown
his
portrait
of
pauline
lister
painted
six
months
after
the
shenstone
visit
had
proved
the
finest
bit
of
work
he
had
as
yet
accomplished
he
had
painted
the
lovely
american
in
creamy
white
satin
standing
on
a
dark
oak
staircase
one
hand
resting
on
the
balustrade
the
other
full
of
yellow
roses
held
out
towards
an
unseen
friend
below
behind
and
above
her
shone
a
window
centuries
old
the
arms
crest
and
mottoes
of
the
noble
family
to
whom
the
place
belonged
shining
thereon
in
and
golden
glass
he
had
wonderfully
caught
the
charm
and
vivacity
of
the
girl
she
was
gaily
and
frankly
american
from
the
crown
of
her
queenly
little
head
to
the
point
of
her
satin
shoe
and
the
suggestiveness
of
placing
her
in
surroundings
which
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
the
best
traditions
of
ancient
ancestral
homes
the
fearless
wedding
of
the
new
world
with
the
old
the
putting
of
this
sparkling
gem
from
the
new
into
the
beautiful
mellow
setting
of
the
old
and
there
showing
it
at
its
best
all
this
was
the
making
of
the
picture
people
smiled
and
said
the
painter
had
done
on
canvas
what
he
shortly
intended
doing
in
reality
but
the
tie
between
artist
and
sitter
never
grew
into
anything
closer
than
a
pleasant
friendship
and
it
was
the
noble
owner
of
the
staircase
and
window
who
eventually
persuaded
miss
lister
to
remain
in
surroundings
which
suited
her
so
admirably
one
story
about
that
portrait
jane
had
heard
discussed
more
than
once
in
circles
where
both
were
known
pauline
lister
had
come
to
the
first
sittings
wearing
her
beautiful
string
of
pearls
and
garth
had
painted
them
wonderfully
spending
hours
over
the
delicate
perfecting
of
each
separate
gleaming
drop
suddenly
one
day
he
seized
his
scraped
the
whole
necklace
off
the
canvas
with
a
stroke
and
declared
she
must
wear
her
in
order
to
carry
out
his
scheme
of
colour
she
was
wearing
her
when
jane
saw
the
picture
in
the
academy
and
very
lovely
they
looked
on
the
delicate
whiteness
of
her
neck
but
people
who
had
seen
garth
painting
of
the
pearls
maintained
that
that
scrape
of
the
had
destroyed
work
which
would
have
been
the
talk
of
the
year
and
pauline
lister
just
after
it
had
happened
was
reported
to
have
said
with
a
shrug
of
her
pretty
shoulders
schemes
of
colour
are
all
very
well
but
he
scraped
my
pearls
off
the
canvas
because
some
one
who
came
in
hummed
a
tune
while
looking
at
the
picture
i
would
be
obliged
if
people
who
walk
around
the
studio
while
i
am
being
painted
will
in
future
refrain
from
humming
tunes
i
do
want
him
to
scoop
off
my
topazes
and
call
for
my
emeralds
also
i
feel
like
offering
a
reward
for
the
discovery
of
that
tune
i
want
to
know
what
it
has
to
do
with
my
scheme
of
colour
anyway
when
jane
heard
the
story
she
was
spending
a
few
days
with
the
brands
in
wimpole
street
it
was
told
at
tea
in
lady
brand
pretty
boudoir
the
duchess
concert
at
which
garth
had
heard
her
sing
the
rosary
was
a
thing
of
the
past
nearly
a
year
had
elapsed
since
their
final
parting
and
this
was
the
very
first
thought
or
word
or
sign
of
his
remembrance
which
directly
or
indirectly
had
come
her
way
she
could
not
doubt
that
the
tune
hummed
had
been
the
rosary
the
hours
i
spent
with
thee
dear
heart
are
as
a
string
of
pearls
to
me
i
count
them
over
every
one
apart
she
seemed
to
hear
garth
voice
on
the
terrace
as
she
heard
it
in
those
first
startled
moments
of
realising
the
gift
which
was
being
laid
at
her
feet
i
have
learned
to
count
pearls
beloved
jane
heart
was
growing
cold
and
frozen
in
its
emptiness
this
incident
of
the
studio
warmed
and
woke
it
for
the
moment
and
with
the
waking
came
sharp
pain
when
the
visitors
had
left
and
lady
brand
had
gone
to
the
nursery
she
walked
over
to
the
piano
sat
down
and
softly
played
the
accompaniment
of
the
rosary
the
fine
unexpected
chords
full
of
discords
working
into
harmony
seemed
to
suit
her
mood
and
her
memories
suddenly
a
voice
behind
her
said
sing
it
jane
she
turned
quickly
the
doctor
had
come
in
and
was
lying
back
luxuriously
in
a
large
at
her
elbow
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
sing
it
jane
he
said
i
ca
deryck
she
answered
still
softly
sounding
the
chords
i
have
not
sung
for
months
what
has
been
the
matter
for
months
jane
took
her
hands
off
the
keys
and
swung
round
impulsively
oh
boy
she
said
i
have
made
a
bad
mess
of
my
life
and
yet
i
know
i
did
right
i
would
do
the
same
again
at
least
at
least
i
hope
i
would
the
doctor
sat
in
silence
for
a
minute
looking
at
her
and
pondering
these
short
quick
sentences
also
he
waited
for
more
knowing
it
would
come
more
easily
if
he
waited
silently
it
came
boy
i
gave
up
something
which
was
more
than
life

to
me
for
the
sake
of
another
and
i
ca
get
over
it
i
know
i
did
right
and
yet

ca
get
over
it
the
doctor
leaned
forward
and
took
the
clenched
hands
between
his

autumn

few
big
things

and
all
your
life
afterwards
when
trivialities
are
trying
you
you
will
love
to
let
your
mind
go
back
to
the
vast
green
mass
of
water
sweeping
over
the
falls
to
the
thunderous
roar
and
the
upward
rush
of
spray
to
the
huge
perpetual
onwardness
of
it
all
you
will
like
to
remember
when
you
are
bothering
about
pouring
water
in
and
out
of
teacups
is
flowing
still
stay
in
a
hotel
so
near
the
falls
that
you
can
hear
their
great
voice
night
and
day
thundering
out
themes
of
power
and
progress
spend
hours
walking
round
and
viewing
it
from
every
point
go
to
the
cave
of
the
winds
across
the
frail
bridges
where
the
guide
will
turn
and
shout
to
you
your
rings
on
tight
learn
in
passing
the
true
meaning
of
the
rock
of
ages
receive
niagara
into
your
life
and
soul
as
a
possession
and
thank
god
for
it
then
go
in
for
other
big
things
in
america
try
spirituality
and
humanity
love
and
life
seek
out
ballington
booth
the
great
mother
of
all
american
prisoners
i
know
her
well
i
am
proud
to
say
and
can
give
you
a
letter
of
introduction
ask
her
to
take
you
with
her
to
or
to
columbus
state
prison
and
to
let
you
hear
her
address
an
audience
of
two
thousand
convicts
holding
out
to
them
the
gospel
of
hope
and
love
her
own
inspired
and
inspiring
belief
in
fresh
possibilities
even
for
the
most
despairing
go
to
new
york
city
and
see
how
when
a
man
wants
a
big
building
and
has
only
a
small
plot
of
ground
he
makes
the
most
of
that
ground
by
running
his
building
up
into
the
sky
learn
to
do
and
then
when
the
people
of
america
have
waked
you
to
enthusiasm
with
their
bigness
go
off
to
japan
and
see
a
little
people
nobly
doing
their
best
to
become
then
to
palestine
and
spend
months
in
tracing
the
footsteps
of
the
greatest
human
life
ever
lived
take
egypt
on
your
way
home
just
to
remind
yourself
that
there
are
still
in
this
very
modern
world
of
ours
a
few
passably
ancient
things
a
wooden
man
for
instance
with
eyes
of
opaque
white
quartz
a
piece
of
rock
crystal
in
the
centre
for
a
pupil
these
glittering
eyes
looked
out
upon
the
world
from
beneath
their
eyelids
of
bronze
in
the
time
of
abraham
you
will
find
it
in
the
museum
at
cairo
ride
a
donkey
in
the
mooskee
if
you
want
real
sport
and
if
you
feel
a
little
slack
climb
the
great
pyramid
ask
for
an
arab
named
schehati
and
tell
him
you
want
to
do
it
one
minute
quicker
than
any
lady
has
ever
done
it
before
then
come
home
my
dear
girl
ring
me
up
and
ask
for
an
appointment
or
chance
it
and
let
stoddart
slip
you
into
my
between
patients
and
report
how
the
prescription
has
worked
i
never
gave
a
better
and
you
need
not
offer
me
a
guinea
i
attend
old
friends
gratis
jane
laughed
and
gripped
his
hand
oh
boy
she
said
i
believe
you
are
right
my
whole
ideas
of
life
have
been
focussed
on
myself
and
my
own
individual
pains
and
losses
i
will
do
as
you
say
and
god
bless
you
for
saying
here
comes
flower
flower
she
said
as
the
doctor
wife
trailed
in
wearing
a
soft
and
turning
on
the
electric
lights
as
she
passed
will
this
boy
of
ours
ever
grow
old
here
he
is
seriously
advising
that
a
stout
woman
should
climb
the
great
pyramid
as
a
cure
for
depression
and
do
it
in
record
time
darling
said
the
doctor
wife
seating
herself
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
whom
have
you
been
seeing
who
is
stout
or
depressed
or
if
you
mean
parker
bangs
she
is
not
because
she
is
an
american
and
no
american
is
ever
and
she
is
only
depressed
because
even
after
painting
her
lovely
portrait
garth
dalmain
has
failed
to
propose
to
her
and
it
is
no
good
advising
her
to
climb
the
great
pyramid
though
she
is
doing
egypt
this
winter
because
i
heard
her
say
yesterday
that
she
should
never
think
of
going
up
the
pyramids
until
the
children
of
israel
or
whoever
the
natives
are
who
live
around
those
parts
have
the
sense
to
put
an
elevator
right
up
the
centre
jane
and
the
doctor
laughed
and
flower
settling
herself
more
comfortably
for
the
doctor
arm
had
stolen
around
her
said
jane
i
heard
you
playing
the
rosary
just
now
such
a
favourite
of
mine
and
it
is
months
since
i
heard
it
do
sing
it
dear
jane
met
the
doctor
eyes
and
smiled
reassuringly
then
turned
without
any
hesitation
and
did
as
flower
asked
the
prescription
had
already
done
her
good
at
the
last
words
of
the
song
the
doctor
wife
bent
over
and
laid
a
tender
little
kiss
just
above
his
temple
where
the
thick
dark
hair
was
streaked
with
silver
but
the
doctor
mind
was
intent
on
jane
and
before
the
final
chords
were
struck
he
knew
he
had
diagnosed
her
case
correctly
but
she
had
better
go
abroad
he
thought
it
will
take
her
mind
off
herself
altogether
giving
her
a
larger
view
of
things
in
general
and
a
better
proportioned
view
of
things
in
particular
and
the
boy
wo
change
or
if
he
does
jane
will
be
proved
right
to
her
own
satisfaction
but
if
this
is
her
side
good
heavens
what
must
his
be
i
had
wondered
what
was
sapping
all
his
buoyant
youthfulness
to
care
for
jane
would
be
an
education
but
to
have
made
jane
care
and
then
to
have
lost
her
he
must
have
nerves
of
steel
to
be
facing
life
at
all
what
is
this
cross
they
are
both
learning
to
kiss
and
holding
up
between
them
perhaps
niagara
will
sweep
it
away
and
she
will
cable
him
from
there
then
the
doctor
took
the
dear
little
hand
resting
on
his
shoulder
and
kissed
it
softly
while
jane
back
was
still
turned
for
the
doctor
had
had
past
experience
of
the
cross
and
now
the
pearls
were
very
precious
so
jane
took
the
prescription
and
two
years
went
by
in
the
taking
and
here
she
was
on
the
top
of
the
great
pyramid
and
moreover
she
had
done
it
in
record
time
and
laughed
as
she
thought
of
how
she
should
report
the
fact
to
deryck
her
arabs
lay
around
very
hot
and
shiny
and
content
large
backsheesh
was
assured
and
they
looked
up
at
her
with
pleased
possessive
eyes
as
an
achievement
of
their
own
hardly
realising
how
large
a
part
her
finely
developed
athletic
powers
and
elastic
limbs
had
played
in
the
speed
of
the
ascent
and
jane
stood
there
sound
in
wind
and
limb
and
with
the
exhilarating
sense
always
helpful
to
the
mind
of
a
bodily
feat
accomplished
she
was
looking
her
best
in
her
norfolk
coat
and
skirt
of
brown
tweed
with
hints
of
green
and
orange
in
it
plenty
of
useful
pockets
piped
with
leather
leather
buttons
and
a
broad
band
of
leather
round
the
bottom
of
the
skirt
a
connoisseur
would
have
named
at
once
the
one
and
only
firm
from
which
that
costume
could
have
come
and
the
hatter
who
supplied
the
soft
green
tyrolian
hat
for
jane
scorned
pith
helmets
which
matched
it
so
admirably
but
schehati
was
no
connoisseur
of
clothing
though
a
pretty
shrewd
judge
of
ways
and
manners
and
he
summed
up
jane
thus
nice
give
good
backsheesh
and
not
sit
down
halfway
and
say
top
but
real
give
backsheesh
with
kind
face
and
not
send
poor
arab
to
assouan
jane
was
deeply
tanned
by
the
eastern
sun
burning
a
splendid
brown
and
enjoying
the
process
she
had
no
need
of
veils
or
parasols
and
her
strong
eyes
faced
the
golden
light
of
the
desert
without
the
aid
of
smoked
glasses
she
had
once
heard
garth
remark
that
a
sight
which
made
him
feel
really
ill
was
the
back
view
of
a
woman
in
a
and
jane
had
laughingly
agreed
for
to
her
veils
of
any
kind
had
always
seemed
superfluous
the
heavy
coils
of
her
brown
hair
never
blew
about
into
fascinating
little
curls
and
wisps
but
remained
where
with
a
few
hairpins
she
each
morning
solidly
placed
them
jane
had
never
looked
better
than
she
did
on
this
march
day
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
great
pyramid
strong
brown
and
a
reliable
mind
in
a
capable
body
the
undeniable
plainness
of
her
face
redeemed
by
its
kindly
expression
of
interest
and
enjoyment
her
wide
pleasant
smile
revealing
her
fine
white
teeth
witnesses
to
her
perfect
soundness
and
health
within
and
without
nice
murmured
schehati
again
and
had
jane
overheard
the
remark
it
would
not
have
offended
her
for
though
she
held
a
masculine
woman
only
one
degree
less
in
abhorrence
than
an
effeminate
man
she
would
have
taken
schehati
compound
noun
as
a
tribute
to
the
fact
that
she
was
and
independent
knowing
her
own
mind
and
when
she
started
out
to
go
to
a
place
reaching
it
in
the
shortest
possible
time
without
fidget
fuss
or
flurry
these
three
feminine
attributes
were
held
in
scorn
by
jane
who
knew
herself
so
deeply
womanly
that
she
could
afford
in
minor
ways
to
be
frankly
unfeminine
the
doctor
prescription
had
worked
admirably
that
look
of
falling
to
pieces
and
ageing
prematurely
a
general
dilapidation
of
mind
and
body
which
it
had
grieved
and
startled
him
to
see
in
jane
as
she
sat
before
him
on
the
was
gone
completely
she
looked
a
calm
pleasant
thirty
ready
to
go
happily
on
year
by
year
towards
an
equally
agreeable
and
delightful
forty
and
not
afraid
of
fifty
when
that
time
should
come
her
clear
eyes
looked
frankly
out
upon
the
world
and
her
sane
mind
formed
sound
opinions
and
pronounced
fair
judgments
tempered
by
the
kindliness
of
an
unusually
large
and
generous
heart
just
now
she
was
considering
the
view
and
finding
it
very
good
its
strong
contrasts
held
her
on
one
side
lay
the
fertile
delta
with
its
groves
of
waving
palm
orange
and
olive
trees
growing
in
rich
profusion
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
a
broad
band
of
gleaming
silver
on
the
other
the
desert
with
its
horizon
stretching
away
in
undulations
of
golden
sand
not
a
tree
not
a
leaf
not
a
blade
of
grass
but
boundless
liberty
an
ocean
of
solid
golden
glory
for
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
sky
flamed
into
colour
a
parting
of
the
ways
said
jane
a
place
of
choice
how
difficult
to
know
which
to
choose
liberty
or
fruitfulness
one
would
have
to
consult
the
sphinx
wise
old
guardian
of
the
ages
silent
keeper
of
time
secrets
gazing
on
into
the
future
as
it
has
always
gazed
while
future
became
present
and
present
glided
into
come
schehati
let
us
descend
oh
yes
i
will
certainly
sit
upon
the
stone
on
which
the
king
sat
when
he
was
prince
of
wales
thank
you
for
mentioning
it
it
will
supply
a
delightful
topic
of
conversation
next
time
i
am
honoured
by
a
few
minutes
of
his
gracious
majesty
attention
and
will
save
me
from
floundering
into
trite
remarks
about
the
and
now
take
me
to
the
sphinx
schehati
there
is
a
question
i
would
ask
of
it
just
as
the
sun
dips
below
the
horizon
chapter
xiii
the
answer
of
the
sphinx
moonlight
in
the
desert
jane
ordered
her
coffee
on
the
piazza
of
the
hotel
that
she
might
lose
as
little
as
possible
of
the
mystic
loveliness
of
the
night
the
pyramids
appeared
so
huge
and
solid
in
the
clear
white
light
and
the
sphinx
gathered
unto
itself
more
mystery
jane
promised
herself
a
stroll
round
by
moonlight
presently
meanwhile
she
lay
back
in
a
low
wicker
chair
comfortably
upholstered
sipping
her
coffee
and
giving
herself
up
to
the
sense
of
dreamy
content
which
in
a
healthy
body
is
apt
to
follow
vigorous
exertion
very
tender
and
quiet
thoughts
of
garth
came
to
her
this
evening
perhaps
brought
about
by
the
associations
of
moonlight
the
moon
shines
bright
in
such
a
night
as
this
when
the
sweet
wind
did
gently
kiss
the
trees
and
they
did
make
no
noise
ah
the
great
poet
knew
the
effect
upon
the
heart
of
a
vivid
reminder
to
the
senses
jane
now
passed
beneath
the
spell
to
begin
with
garth
voice
seemed
singing
everywhere
enable
with
perpetual
light
the
dulness
of
our
blinded
sight
then
from
out
the
deep
blue
and
silvery
light
garth
dear
adoring
eyes
seemed
watching
her
jane
closed
her
own
to
see
them
better
she
did
not
feel
like
shrinking
from
them
they
were
so
full
of
love
no
shade
of
critical
regard
was
in
them
ah
had
she
wronged
him
with
her
fears
for
the
future
her
heart
seemed
full
of
trust
full
of
confidence
in
him
and
in
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
he
were
here
she
could
go
out
with
him
into
this
brilliant
moonlight
seat
herself
upon
some
ancient
fallen
stone
and
let
him
kneel
in
front
of
her
and
gaze
and
gaze
in
his
persistent
way
as
much
as
he
pleased
in
thought
there
seemed
no
shrinking
from
those
dear
eyes
she
felt
she
would
say
it
is
all
your
own
garth
to
look
at
when
you
will
for
your
sake
i
could
wish
it
beautiful
but
if
it
is
as
you
like
it
my
own
dear
why
should
i
hide
it
from
you
what
had
brought
about
this
change
of
mind
had
deryck
prescription
done
its
full
work
was
this
a
saner
point
of
view
than
the
one
she
had
felt
constrained
to
take
when
she
arrived
through
so
much
agony
of
renunciation
at
her
decision
instead
of
going
up
the
nile
and
then
to
constantinople
and
athens
should
she
take
the
steamer
which
sailed
from
alexandria
be
in
london
a
week
hence
send
for
garth
make
full
confession
and
let
him
decide
as
to
their
future
that
he
loved
her
still
it
never
occurred
to
jane
to
doubt
at
the
very
thought
of
sending
for
him
and
telling
him
the
simple
truth
he
seemed
so
near
her
once
more
that
she
could
feel
the
clasp
of
his
arms
and
his
head
upon
her
heart
and
those
dear
shining
eyes
oh
garth
garth
one
thing
is
clear
to
me
thought
jane
if
he
still
needs
me
wants
me
i
can
not
live
any
longer
away
from
him
i
must
go
to
him
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
towards
the
sphinx
the
whole
line
of
reasoning
which
had
carried
such
weight
at
shenstone
flashed
through
her
mind
in
twenty
seconds
then
she
closed
her
eyes
again
and
clasped
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
i
will
risk
it
she
said
and
deep
joy
awoke
within
her
heart
a
party
of
english
people
came
from
the
on
to
the
piazza
with
a
clatter
they
had
arrived
that
evening
and
gone
in
late
to
dinner
jane
had
hardly
noticed
them
a
handsome
woman
and
her
daughter
two
young
men
and
an
older
man
of
military
appearance
they
did
not
interest
jane
but
they
broke
in
upon
her
reverie
for
they
seated
themselves
at
a
table
near
by
and
in
truly
british
fashion
continued
a
conversation
as
if
no
one
else
were
present
one
or
two
foreigners
who
had
been
peacefully
dreaming
over
coffee
and
cigarettes
rose
and
strolled
away
to
quiet
seats
under
the
palm
trees
jane
would
have
done
the
same
but
she
really
felt
too
comfortable
to
move
and
afraid
of
losing
the
sweet
sense
of
garth
nearness
so
she
remained
where
she
was
the
elderly
man
held
in
his
hand
a
letter
and
a
copy
of
the
morning
post
just
received
from
england
they
were
discussing
news
contained
in
the
letter
and
a
paragraph
he
had
been
reading
aloud
from
the
paper
poor
fellow
how
too
sad
said
the
chaperon
of
the
party
i
should
think
he
would
sooner
have
been
killed
outright
exclaimed
the
girl
i
know
i
would
oh
no
said
one
of
the
young
men
leaning
towards
her
life
is
sweet
under
any
circumstances
oh
but
blind
cried
the
young
voice
with
a
shudder
quite
blind
for
the
rest
of
one
life
horrible
was
it
his
own
gun
asked
the
older
woman
and
how
came
they
to
be
having
a
shooting
party
in
march
jane
smiled
a
fierce
smile
into
the
moonlight
passionate
love
of
animal
life
intense
regard
for
all
life
even
of
the
tiniest
insect
was
as
much
a
religion
with
her
as
the
worship
of
beauty
was
with
garth
she
never
could
pretend
sorrow
over
these
accounts
of
shooting
accidents
or
falls
in
the
when
those
who
went
out
to
inflict
cruel
pain
were
hurt
themselves
when
those
who
went
forth
to
take
eager
palpitating
life
lost
their
own
it
seemed
to
jane
a
just
retribution
she
felt
no
regret
and
pretended
none
so
now
she
smiled
fiercely
to
herself
thinking
one
pair
of
eyes
the
less
to
look
along
a
gun
and
frustrate
the
despairing
dash
for
home
and
little
ones
of
a
terrified
little
mother
rabbit
one
hand
that
will
never
again
change
a
soaring
upward
flight
of
spreading
wings
into
an
agonised
mass
of
falling
feathers
one
chance
to
the
good
for
the
noble
stag
as
he
makes
a
brave
run
to
join
his
hinds
in
the
valley
meanwhile
the
man
had
readjusted
his
and
was
holding
the
sheets
of
a
closely
written
letter
to
the
light
no
he
said
after
a
moment
shooting
parties
are
over
there
is
nothing
doing
on
the
moors
now
they
were
potting
bunnies
was
he
shooting
asked
the
girl
no
replied
the
owner
of
the
letter
and
that
seems
such
hard
luck
he
had
given
up
shooting
altogether
a
year
or
two
ago
he
never
really
enjoyed
it
because
he
so
loved
the
beauty
of
life
and
hated
death
in
every
form
he
has
a
lovely
place
in
the
north
and
was
up
there
painting
he
happened
to
pass
within
sight
of
some
fellows
and
saw
what
he
considered
cruelty
to
a
wounded
rabbit
he
vaulted
over
a
gate
to
expostulate
and
to
save
the
little
creature
from
further
suffering
then
it
happened
one
of
the
lads
apparently
startled
let
off
his
gun
the
charge
struck
a
tree
a
few
yards
off
and
the
shot
glanced
it
did
not
strike
him
full
the
face
is
only
slightly
peppered
and
the
brain
quite
uninjured
but
shots
pierced
the
retina
of
each
eye
and
the
sight
is
hopelessly
gone
awful
hard
luck
said
the
young
man
i
never
can
understand
a
chap
not
bein
keen
on
shootin
said
the
youth
who
had
not
yet
spoken
ah
but
you
would
if
you
had
known
him
said
the
soldier
he
was
so
full
of
life
and
vivid
vitality
one
could
not
imagine
him
either
dying
or
dealing
death
and
his
love
of
the
beautiful
was
almost
a
form
of
religious
worship
i
ca
explain
it
but
he
had
a
way
of
making
you
see
beauty
in
things
you
had
hardly
noticed
before
and
now
poor
chap
he
ca
see
them
himself
has
he
a
mother
asked
the
older
woman
no
he
has
no
one
he
is
absolutely
alone
scores
of
friends
of
course
he
was
a
most
popular
man
about
town
and
could
stay
in
almost
any
house
in
the
kingdom
if
he
chose
to
send
a
to
say
he
was
coming
but
no
relations
i
believe
and
never
would
marry
poor
chap
he
will
wish
he
had
been
less
fastidious
now
he
might
have
had
the
pick
of
all
the
nicest
girls
most
seasons
but
not
he
just
charming
friendships
and
wedded
to
his
art
and
now
as
lady
ingleby
says
he
lies
in
the
dark
helpless
and
alone
oh
do
talk
of
something
else
cried
the
girl
pushing
back
her
chair
and
rising
i
want
to
forget
it
it
too
horribly
sad
fancy
what
it
must
be
to
wake
up
and
not
know
whether
it
is
day
or
night
and
to
have
to
lie
in
the
dark
and
wonder
oh
do
come
out
and
talk
of
something
cheerful
they
all
rose
and
the
young
man
slipped
his
hand
through
the
arm
glad
of
the
excuse
her
agitation
provided
forget
it
dear
he
said
softly
come
on
out
and
see
the
old
sphinx
by
moonlight
they
left
the
piazza
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
party
but
the
man
to
whom
the
morning
post
belonged
laid
it
on
the
table
and
stayed
behind
lighting
a
cigar
jane
rose
from
her
chair
and
came
towards
him
may
i
look
at
your
paper
she
said
abruptly
certainly
he
replied
with
ready
courtesy
then
looking
more
closely
at
her
why
certainly
miss
champion
and
how
do
you
do
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
these
parts
ah
general
loraine
your
face
seemed
familiar
but
i
had
not
recognised
you
either
thanks
i
will
borrow
this
if
i
may
and
let
me
keep
you
from
your
friends
we
shall
meet
again
by
and
by
jane
waited
until
the
whole
party
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
until
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
laughter
had
died
away
in
the
distance
then
she
returned
to
her
chair
the
place
where
garth
had
seemed
so
near
she
looked
once
more
at
the
sphinx
and
at
the
huge
pyramid
in
the
moonlight
then
she
took
up
the
paper
and
opened
it
enable
with
perpetual
light
the
dulness
of
our
blinded
sight
yes
it
was
garth
dalmain
her
garth
of
the
adoring
shining
eyes
who
lay
at
his
house
in
the
north
blind
helpless
and
alone
chapter
xiv
in
deryck
safe
control
the
white
cliffs
of
dover
gradually
became
more
solid
and
distinct
until
at
length
they
rose
from
the
sea
a
strong
white
wall
emblem
of
the
undeniable
purity
of
england
the
stainless
honour
and
integrity
of
her
throne
her
church
her
parliament
her
courts
of
justice
and
her
dealings
at
home
and
abroad
whether
with
friend
or
foe
strength
and
whiteness
thought
jane
as
she
paced
the
steamer
deck
and
after
a
two
years
absence
her
heart
went
out
to
her
native
land
then
dover
castle
caught
her
eye
so
beautiful
in
the
pearly
light
of
that
spring
afternoon
her
mind
leaped
to
enjoyment
then
fell
back
stunned
by
the
blow
of
quick
remembrance
and
jane
shut
her
eyes
all
beautiful
sights
brought
this
pang
to
her
heart
since
the
reading
of
that
paragraph
on
the
piazza
of
the
mena
house
hotel
an
hour
after
she
had
read
it
she
was
driving
down
the
long
straight
road
to
cairo
embarked
at
alexandria
the
next
day
landed
at
brindisi
and
this
night
and
day
travelling
had
brought
her
at
last
within
sight
of
the
shores
of
england
in
a
few
minutes
she
would
set
foot
upon
them
and
then
there
would
be
but
two
more
stages
to
her
journey
for
from
the
moment
she
started
jane
never
doubted
her
ultimate
destination
the
room
where
pain
and
darkness
and
despair
must
be
waging
so
terrible
a
conflict
against
the
moral
courage
the
mental
sanity
and
the
instinctive
hold
on
life
of
the
man
she
loved
that
she
was
going
to
him
jane
knew
but
she
felt
utterly
unable
to
arrange
how
or
in
what
way
her
going
could
be
managed
that
it
was
a
complicated
problem
her
common
sense
told
her
though
her
yearning
arms
and
aching
bosom
cried
out
o
god
is
it
not
simple
blind
and
alone
my
garth
but
she
knew
an
unbiased
judgment
steadier
than
her
own
must
solve
the
problem
and
that
her
surest
way
to
garth
lay
through
the
so
she
telegraphed
to
deryck
from
paris
and
at
present
her
mind
saw
no
further
than
wimpole
street
at
dover
she
bought
a
paper
and
hastily
scanned
its
pages
as
she
walked
along
the
platform
in
the
wake
of
the
capable
porter
who
had
taken
possession
of
her
rugs
and
hand
baggage
in
the
personal
column
she
found
the
very
paragraph
she
sought
we
regret
to
announce
that
garth
dalmain
still
lies
in
a
most
precarious
condition
at
his
house
on
deeside
aberdeenshire
as
a
result
of
the
shooting
accident
a
fortnight
ago
his
sight
is
hopelessly
gone
but
the
injured
parts
were
progressing
favourably
and
all
fear
of
brain
complications
seemed
over
during
the
last
few
days
however
a
serious
reaction
from
shock
has
set
in
and
it
has
been
considered
necessary
to
summon
sir
deryck
brand
the
nerve
specialist
in
consultation
with
the
oculist
and
the
local
practitioner
in
charge
of
the
case
there
is
a
feeling
of
regret
and
sympathy
in
those
social
and
artistic
circles
where
dalmain
was
so
and
so
deservedly
popular
oh
thank
you
said
the
efficient
porter
when
he
had
ascertained
by
a
rapid
glance
into
his
palm
that
jane
was
not
a
penny
he
had
a
sick
young
wife
at
home
who
had
been
ordered
extra
nourishment
and
just
as
the
rush
on
board
began
he
had
put
up
a
simple
prayer
to
the
heavenly
father
who
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
things
asking
that
he
might
catch
the
eye
of
a
generous
traveller
he
felt
he
had
indeed
been
led
to
this
plain
lady
when
he
remembered
how
nearly
after
her
curt
nod
from
a
distance
had
engaged
him
he
had
responded
to
the
blandishments
of
a
fussy
little
woman
with
many
more
bags
and
rugs
and
a
parrot
cage
who
was
now
doling
french
coppers
out
of
the
window
of
the
next
compartment
seven
pence
of
this
stuff
ai
much
for
carrying
all
that
along
i
do
think
grumbled
his
mate
and
jane
young
porter
experienced
the
double
joy
of
faith
confirmed
and
willing
service
generously
rewarded
a
telegraph
boy
walked
along
the
train
saying
honrubble
jain
champyun
at
intervals
jane
heard
her
name
and
her
arm
shot
out
of
the
window
here
my
boy
it
is
for
me
she
tore
it
open
it
was
from
the
doctor
welcome
home
just
back
from
scotland
will
meet
you
charing
cross
and
give
you
all
the
time
you
want
have
coffee
at
dover
deryck
jane
gave
one
hard
tearless
sob
of
thankfulness
and
relief
she
had
been
so
lonely
then
she
turned
to
the
window
here
somebody
fetch
me
a
cup
of
coffee
will
you
coffee
was
the
last
thing
she
wanted
but
it
never
occurred
to
any
one
to
disobey
the
doctor
even
at
a
distance
the
young
porter
who
still
stood
sentry
at
the
door
of
compartment
dashed
off
to
the
refreshment
room
and
just
as
the
train
began
to
move
handed
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
and
a
plate
of
in
at
the
window
oh
thank
you
my
good
fellow
said
jane
putting
the
plate
on
the
seat
while
she
dived
into
her
pocket
here
you
have
done
very
well
for
me
no
never
mind
the
change
coffee
at
a
moment
notice
should
fetch
a
fancy
price
the
train
moved
on
and
the
porter
stood
looking
after
it
with
tears
in
his
eyes
over
the
first
he
had
said
to
himself
milk
and
eggs
now
as
he
pocketed
the
second
he
added
the
other
two
things
mentioned
by
the
parish
doctor
soup
and
jelly
and
his
heart
glowed
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
things
and
jane
seated
in
a
comfortable
corner
choked
back
the
tears
of
relief
which
threatened
to
fall
drank
her
coffee
and
was
thereby
more
revived
than
she
could
have
thought
possible
she
also
had
need
of
many
things
not
of
of
those
she
had
plenty
but
above
all
else
she
needed
just
now
a
wise
strong
helpful
friend
and
deryck
had
not
failed
her
she
read
his
telegram
through
once
more
and
smiled
how
like
him
to
think
of
the
coffee
and
oh
how
like
him
to
be
coming
to
the
station
she
took
off
her
hat
and
leaned
back
against
the
cushions
she
had
been
travelling
night
and
day
in
one
feverish
whirl
of
haste
and
at
last
she
had
brought
herself
within
reach
of
deryck
hand
and
deryck
safe
control
the
turmoil
of
her
soul
was
stilled
a
great
calm
took
its
place
and
jane
dropped
quietly
off
to
sleep
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
these
things
washed
and
brushed
and
greatly
refreshed
jane
stood
at
the
window
of
her
compartment
as
the
train
steamed
into
charing
cross
the
doctor
was
stationed
exactly
opposite
the
door
when
her
carriage
came
to
a
standstill
mere
chance
and
yet
to
jane
it
seemed
so
like
him
to
have
taken
up
his
position
precisely
at
the
right
spot
on
that
long
platform
an
enthusiastic
lady
patient
had
once
said
of
deryck
brand
with
more
accuracy
of
definition
than
of
grammar
you
know
he
is
always
so
very
just
there
and
this
characteristic
of
the
doctor
had
made
him
to
many
a
very
present
help
in
time
of
trouble
he
was
through
the
line
of
porters
and
had
his
hand
upon
the
handle
of
jane
door
in
a
moment
standing
at
the
window
she
took
one
look
at
the
firm
lean
face
now
alight
with
welcome
and
read
in
the
kind
steadfast
eyes
of
her
childhood
friend
a
perfect
sympathy
and
comprehension
then
she
saw
behind
him
her
aunt
footman
and
her
own
maid
who
had
been
given
a
place
in
the
duchess
household
in
another
moment
she
was
on
the
platform
and
her
hand
was
in
deryck
that
is
right
dear
he
said
all
fit
and
well
i
can
see
now
hand
over
your
keys
i
suppose
you
have
nothing
contraband
i
telephoned
the
duchess
to
send
some
of
her
people
to
meet
your
luggage
and
not
to
expect
you
herself
until
dinner
time
as
you
were
taking
tea
with
us
was
that
right
this
way
come
outside
the
barrier
what
a
rabble
all
wanting
to
break
every
possible
rule
and
regulation
and
each
trying
to
be
the
first
person
in
the
front
row
really
the
patience
and
good
temper
of
railway
officials
should
teach
the
rest
of
mankind
a
lesson
the
doctor
talking
all
the
time
piloted
jane
through
the
crowd
opened
the
door
of
a
neat
electric
brougham
helped
her
in
took
his
seat
beside
her
and
they
glided
swiftly
out
into
the
strand
and
turned
towards
trafalgar
square
well
said
the
doctor
niagara
is
a
big
thing
is
it
when
people
say
to
me
you
not
disappointed
in
niagara
we
were
i
feel
tempted
to
wish
for
one
homicidal
moment
that
the
earth
would
open
her
mouth
and
swallow
them
up
people
who
can
be
disappointed
in
niagara
and
talk
about
it
should
no
longer
be
allowed
to
crawl
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
how
about
the
mother
is
she
worth
knowing
i
hope
she
sent
me
her
love
and
new
york
harbour
did
you
ever
see
anything
to
equal
it
as
you
steam
away
in
the
sunset
jane
gave
a
sudden
sob
then
turned
to
him
is
there
no
hope
deryck
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
on
hers
he
will
always
be
blind
dear
but
life
holds
other
things
beside
sight
we
must
never
say
hope
will
he
live
there
is
no
reason
he
should
not
live
but
how
far
life
will
be
worth
living
largely
depends
upon
what
can
be
done
for
him
poor
chap
during
the
next
few
months
he
is
more
shattered
mentally
than
physically
jane
pulled
off
her
gloves
swallowed
suddenly
then
gripped
the
doctor
knee
deryck
i
love
him
the
doctor
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
if
pondering
this
tremendous
fact
then
he
lifted
the
fine
capable
hand
resting
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
it
with
a
beautiful
reverence
a
gesture
expressing
the
homage
of
the
man
to
the
brave
truthfulness
of
the
woman
in
that
case
dear
he
said
the
future
holds
in
store
so
great
a
good
for
garth
dalmain
that
i
think
he
may
dispense
with
meanwhile
you
have
much
to
say
to
me
and
it
is
of
course
your
right
to
hear
every
detail
of
his
case
that
i
can
give
and
here
we
are
at
wimpole
street
now
come
into
my
stoddart
has
orders
that
we
are
on
no
account
to
be
disturbed
chapter
xv
the
consultation
the
doctor
room
was
very
quiet
jane
leaned
back
in
his
dark
green
leather
her
feet
on
a
footstool
her
hands
gripping
the
arms
on
either
side
the
doctor
sat
at
his
table
in
the
round
he
always
used
a
chair
which
enabled
him
to
swing
round
suddenly
and
face
a
patient
or
to
turn
away
very
quietly
and
bend
over
his
table
just
now
he
was
not
looking
at
jane
he
had
been
giving
her
a
detailed
account
of
his
visit
to
castle
gleneesh
which
he
had
left
only
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
spent
five
hours
with
garth
it
seemed
kindest
to
tell
her
all
but
he
was
looking
straight
before
him
as
he
talked
because
he
knew
that
at
last
the
tears
were
running
unchecked
down
jane
cheeks
and
he
wished
her
to
think
he
did
not
notice
them
you
understand
dear
he
was
saying
the
actual
wounds
are
going
on
well
strangely
enough
though
the
retina
of
each
eye
was
pierced
and
the
sight
is
irrecoverably
gone
there
was
very
little
damage
done
to
surrounding
parts
and
the
brain
is
quite
uninjured
the
present
danger
arises
from
the
shock
to
the
nervous
system
and
from
the
extreme
mental
anguish
caused
by
the
realisation
of
his
loss
the
physical
suffering
during
the
first
days
and
nights
must
have
been
terrible
poor
fellow
he
looks
shattered
by
it
but
his
constitution
is
excellent
and
his
life
has
been
so
clean
healthy
and
normal
that
he
had
every
chance
of
making
a
good
recovery
were
it
not
that
as
the
pain
abated
and
his
blindness
became
more
a
thing
to
be
daily
and
hourly
realised
his
mental
torture
was
so
excessive
sight
has
meant
so
infinitely
much
to
him
beauty
of
form
beauty
of
colour
the
artist
in
him
was
so
they
tell
me
he
said
very
little
he
is
a
brave
man
and
a
strong
one
but
his
temperature
began
to
vary
alarmingly
he
showed
symptoms
of
mental
trouble
of
which
i
need
not
give
you
technical
details
and
a
nerve
specialist
seemed
more
necessary
than
an
oculist
therefore
he
is
now
in
my
hands
the
doctor
paused
straightened
a
few
books
lying
on
the
table
and
drew
a
small
bowl
of
violets
closer
to
him
he
studied
these
attentively
for
a
few
moments
then
put
them
back
where
his
wife
had
placed
them
and
went
on
speaking
i
am
satisfied
on
the
whole
he
needed
a
friendly
voice
to
penetrate
the
darkness
he
needed
a
hand
to
grasp
his
in
faithful
comprehension
he
did
not
want
pity
and
those
who
talked
of
his
loss
without
understanding
it
or
being
able
to
measure
its
immensity
maddened
him
he
needed
a
to
come
to
him
and
say
is
a
fight
an
awful
desperate
fight
but
by
god
grace
you
will
win
through
to
victory
it
would
be
far
easier
to
die
but
to
die
would
be
to
lose
you
must
live
to
win
it
is
utterly
beyond
all
human
strength
but
by
god
grace
you
will
come
through
conqueror
all
this
i
said
to
him
jeanette
and
a
good
deal
more
and
then
a
strangely
beautiful
thing
happened
i
can
tell
you
and
of
course
i
could
tell
flower
but
to
no
one
else
on
earth
would
i
repeat
it
the
difficulty
had
been
to
obtain
from
him
any
response
whatever
he
did
not
seem
able
to
rouse
sufficiently
to
notice
anything
going
on
around
him
but
those
words
god
grace
appeared
to
take
hold
of
him
and
find
immediate
echo
in
his
inner
consciousness
i
heard
him
repeat
them
once
or
twice
and
then
change
them
to
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
then
he
turned
his
head
slowly
on
the
pillow
and
what
one
could
see
of
his
face
seemed
transformed
he
said
i
remember
it
and
the
music
is
this
and
his
hands
moved
on
the
bedclothes
as
if
forming
chords
then
in
a
very
low
voice
but
quite
clearly
he
repeated
the
second
verse
of
the
veni
creator
spiritus
i
knew
it
because
i
used
to
sing
it
as
a
chorister
in
my
father
church
at
home
you
remember
with
perpetual
light
the
dulness
of
our
blinded
sight
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
with
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
it
was
the
most
touching
thing
i
ever
heard
the
doctor
paused
for
jane
had
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
was
sobbing
convulsively
when
her
sobs
grew
less
violent
the
quiet
voice
continued
you
see
this
gave
me
something
to
go
upon
when
a
crash
such
as
this
happens
all
a
man
has
left
to
hold
on
to
is
his
religion
according
as
his
spiritual
side
has
been
developed
will
his
physical
side
stand
the
strain
dalmain
has
more
of
the
real
thing
than
any
one
would
think
who
only
knew
him
superficially
well
after
that
we
talked
quite
definitely
and
i
persuaded
him
to
agree
to
one
or
two
important
arrangements
you
know
he
has
no
relations
of
his
own
to
speak
of
just
a
few
cousins
who
have
never
been
very
friendly
he
is
quite
alone
up
there
for
though
he
has
hosts
of
friends
this
is
a
time
when
friends
would
have
to
be
very
intimate
to
be
admitted
and
though
he
seemed
so
boyish
and
easy
to
know
i
begin
to
doubt
whether
any
of
us
knew
the
real
garth
the
soul
of
the
man
deep
down
beneath
the
surface
jane
lifted
her
head
i
did
she
said
simply
ah
said
the
doctor
i
see
well
as
i
said
ordinary
friends
could
not
be
admitted
lady
ingleby
went
in
her
sweet
impulsive
way
without
letting
them
know
she
was
coming
travelled
all
the
way
up
from
shenstone
with
no
maid
and
nothing
but
a
handbag
and
arrived
at
the
door
in
a
fly
robert
mackenzie
the
local
medical
man
who
is
an
inveterate
misogynist
feared
at
first
she
was
an
unsuspected
wife
of
dal
he
seemed
to
think
unannounced
ladies
arriving
in
hired
vehicles
must
necessarily
turn
out
to
be
undesirable
wives
i
gather
they
had
a
somewhat
funny
scene
but
lady
ingleby
soon
got
round
old
robbie
and
came
near
to
charming
him
as
whom
does
she
not
but
of
course
they
did
not
dare
let
her
into
dal
room
so
her
ministry
of
consolation
appears
to
have
consisted
in
letting
dal
old
housekeeper
weep
on
her
beautiful
shoulder
it
was
somewhat
of
a
comedy
hearing
about
it
when
one
happened
to
know
them
all
better
than
they
knew
each
other
but
to
return
to
practical
details
he
has
had
a
fully
trained
male
nurse
and
his
own
valet
to
wait
on
him
he
absolutely
refused
one
of
our
london
hospital
nurses
who
might
have
brought
a
little
gentle
comfort
and
womanly
sympathy
to
his
he
said
he
could
not
stand
being
touched
by
a
woman
so
there
it
remained
a
competent
man
was
found
instead
but
we
can
now
dispense
with
him
and
i
have
insisted
upon
sending
up
a
lady
nurse
of
my
own
choosing
not
so
much
to
wait
on
him
or
do
any
of
a
ordinary
duties
his
own
man
can
do
these
and
he
seems
a
capable
fellow
but
to
sit
with
him
read
to
him
attend
to
his
correspondence
there
are
piles
of
unopened
letters
he
ought
to
hear
in
fact
help
him
to
take
up
life
again
in
his
blindness
it
will
need
training
it
will
require
tact
and
this
afternoon
i
engaged
exactly
the
right
person
she
is
a
gentlewoman
by
birth
has
nursed
for
me
before
and
is
well
up
in
the
special
knowledge
of
mental
things
which
this
case
requires
also
she
is
a
pretty
dainty
little
thing
just
the
kind
of
elegant
young
woman
poor
dal
would
have
liked
to
have
about
him
when
he
could
see
he
was
such
a
fastidious
chap
about
appearances
and
such
a
connoisseur
of
good
looks
i
have
written
a
descriptive
account
of
her
to
mackenzie
and
he
will
prepare
his
patient
for
her
arrival
she
is
to
go
up
the
day
after
we
are
lucky
to
get
her
for
she
is
quite
and
she
has
only
just
finished
with
a
long
consumptive
case
now
on
the
mend
and
ordered
abroad
so
you
see
jeanette
all
is
shaping
and
now
my
dear
girl
you
have
a
story
of
your
own
to
tell
me
and
my
whole
attention
shall
be
at
your
disposal
but
first
of
all
i
am
going
to
ring
for
tea
and
you
and
i
will
have
it
quietly
down
here
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
go
upstairs
and
speak
to
flower
it
seemed
so
natural
to
jane
to
be
pouring
out
the
doctor
tea
and
to
watch
him
putting
a
liberal
allowance
of
salt
on
the
thin
and
then
folding
it
over
with
the
careful
accuracy
which
had
always
characterised
his
smallest
action
in
the
essentials
he
had
changed
so
little
since
the
days
when
as
a
youth
of
twenty
spending
his
vacations
at
the
rectory
he
used
to
give
the
lonely
girl
at
the
manor
so
much
pleasure
by
coming
up
to
her
tea
and
when
it
proved
possible
to
dispose
of
her
governess
chaperonage
and
be
by
themselves
what
delightful
times
they
used
to
have
sitting
on
the
roasting
chestnuts
and
discussing
the
many
subjects
which
were
of
mutual
interest
jane
could
still
remember
the
painful
pleasure
of
turning
hot
chestnuts
on
the
bars
with
her
fingers
and
how
she
hastened
to
do
them
herself
lest
he
should
be
burned
she
had
always
secretly
liked
and
admired
his
hands
with
the
brown
thin
fingers
so
delicate
in
their
touch
and
yet
full
of
such
gentle
strength
she
used
to
love
watching
them
while
he
sharpened
her
pencils
or
drew
wonderful
diagrams
in
her
exercise
books
thinking
how
in
years
to
come
when
he
performed
important
operations
human
lives
would
depend
upon
their
skill
and
dexterity
in
those
early
years
he
had
seemed
so
much
older
than
she
and
then
came
the
time
when
she
shot
up
rapidly
into
young
womanhood
and
their
eyes
were
on
a
level
and
their
ages
seemed
the
same
then
as
the
years
went
on
jane
began
to
feel
older
than
he
and
took
to
calling
him
boy
to
emphasise
this
fact
and
then
came
flower
and
complications
and
jane
had
to
see
his
face
grow
thin
and
worn
and
his
hair
whiten
on
the
temples
and
she
yearned
over
him
yet
dared
not
offer
sympathy
at
last
things
came
right
for
the
doctor
and
all
the
highest
good
seemed
his
in
his
profession
in
his
standing
among
men
and
above
all
in
his
heart
life
which
flower
had
always
held
between
her
two
sweet
hands
and
jane
rejoiced
but
felt
still
more
lonely
now
she
had
no
companion
in
loneliness
and
still
their
friendship
held
with
flower
admitted
as
a
third
a
wistful
grateful
third
anxious
to
learn
from
the
woman
whose
friendship
meant
so
much
to
her
husband
how
to
succeed
where
she
had
hitherto
failed
and
jane
faithful
heart
was
generous
and
loyal
to
both
though
in
sight
of
their
perfect
happiness
her
loneliness
grew
and
now
in
her
own
hour
of
need
it
had
to
be
deryck
only
and
the
doctor
knew
this
and
had
arranged
accordingly
for
at
last
his
chance
had
come
to
repay
the
faithful
devotion
of
a
lifetime
the
conversation
of
that
afternoon
would
be
the
supreme
test
of
their
friendship
and
so
with
a
specialist
appreciation
of
the
mental
effect
of
the
most
trivial
external
details
the
doctor
had
ordered
muffins
and
a
kettle
on
the
fire
and
had
asked
jane
to
make
the
tea
by
the
time
the
kettle
boiled
they
had
remembered
the
chestnuts
and
were
laughing
about
poor
old
fraulein
efforts
to
keep
them
in
order
and
the
strategies
by
which
they
used
to
evade
her
vigilance
and
the
years
rolled
back
and
jane
felt
herself
very
much
at
home
with
the
chum
of
her
childhood
nevertheless
there
was
a
moment
of
tension
when
the
doctor
drew
back
the
and
they
faced
each
other
in
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
each
noticed
how
characteristic
was
the
attitude
of
the
other
jane
sat
forward
her
feet
firmly
planted
on
the
her
arms
on
her
knees
and
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
the
doctor
leaned
back
one
knee
crossed
over
the
other
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
the
tips
of
his
fingers
meeting
in
absolute
stillness
of
body
and
intense
concentration
of
mind
the
silence
between
them
was
like
a
deep
calm
pool
jane
took
the
first
plunge
deryck
i
am
going
to
tell
you
everything
i
am
going
to
speak
of
my
heart
and
mind
and
feelings
exactly
as
if
they
were
bones
and
muscles
and
lungs
i
want
you
to
combine
the
offices
of
doctor
and
confessor
in
one
the
doctor
had
been
contemplating
his
he
now
glanced
swiftly
at
jane
and
nodded
then
turned
his
head
and
looked
into
the
fire
deryck
mine
has
been
a
somewhat
lonely
existence
i
have
never
been
essential
to
the
life
of
another
and
no
one
has
ever
touched
the
real
depths
of
mine
i
have
known
they
were
there
but
i
have
known
they
were
unsounded
the
doctor
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
then
closed
them
in
a
firmer
line
than
before
and
merely
nodded
his
head
silently
i
had
never
been
loved
with
that
love
which
makes
one
absolutely
first
to
a
person
nor
had
i
ever
so
loved
i
had
cared
very
much
but
caring
is
not
oh
boy
i
know
that
now
the
doctor
profile
showed
rather
white
against
the
background
of
his
chair
but
he
smiled
as
he
answered
quite
true
dear
there
is
a
distinction
and
a
difference
i
had
heaps
of
friends
and
amongst
them
a
good
many
nice
men
mostly
rather
younger
than
myself
who
called
me
champion
to
my
face
and
old
jane
behind
my
back
the
doctor
smiled
he
had
as
often
heard
the
expression
and
could
recall
the
affection
and
admiration
in
the
tones
of
those
who
used
it
men
as
a
rule
continued
jane
get
on
better
with
me
than
do
women
being
large
and
solid
and
usually
calling
a
spade
spade
and
not
garden
implement
women
consider
me
and
are
inclined
to
be
afraid
of
me
the
boys
know
they
can
trust
me
they
make
a
confidante
of
me
looking
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
convenient
elder
sister
who
knows
less
about
them
than
an
elder
sister
would
know
and
is
probably
more
ready
to
be
interested
in
those
things
which
they
choose
to
tell
among
my
men
friends
deryck
was
garth
dalmain
jane
paused
and
the
doctor
waited
silently
for
her
to
continue
i
was
always
interested
in
him
partly
because
he
was
so
original
and
vivid
in
his
way
of
talking
and
partly
because
a
bright
flush
suddenly
crept
up
into
the
tanned
well
though
i
did
not
realise
it
then
i
suppose
i
found
his
extraordinary
beauty
rather
fascinating
and
then
our
circumstances
were
so
much
alike
both
orphans
and
well
off
responsible
to
no
one
for
our
actions
with
heaps
of
mutual
friends
and
constantly
staying
at
the
same
houses
we
drifted
into
a
pleasant
intimacy
and
of
all
my
friends
he
was
the
one
who
made
me
feel
most
like
man
and
a
brother
we
discussed
women
by
the
dozen
all
his
special
admirations
in
turn
and
the
effect
of
their
beauty
upon
him
and
i
watched
with
interest
to
see
who
at
last
would
fix
his
roving
fancy
but
on
one
eventful
day
all
this
was
changed
in
half
an
hour
we
were
both
staying
at
overdene
there
was
a
big
house
party
and
aunt
georgina
had
arranged
a
concert
to
which
half
the
neighbourhood
was
coming
madame
velma
failed
at
the
last
minute
aunt
in
a
great
state
of
mind
was
borrowing
remarks
from
her
macaw
you
know
how
she
always
says
she
is
merely
quoting
dear
bird
something
had
to
be
done
i
offered
to
take
velma
place
and
i
sang
ah
said
the
doctor
i
sang
the
rosary
the
song
flower
asked
for
the
last
time
i
was
here
do
you
remember
the
doctor
nodded
i
remember
after
that
all
was
changed
between
garth
and
me
i
did
not
understand
it
at
first
i
knew
the
music
had
moved
him
deeply
beauty
of
sound
having
upon
him
much
the
same
effect
as
beauty
of
colour
but
i
thought
the
effect
would
pass
in
the
night
but
the
days
went
on
and
there
was
always
this
strange
sweet
difference
not
anything
others
would
notice
but
i
suddenly
became
conscious
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
whole
life
i
was
essential
to
somebody
i
could
not
enter
a
room
without
realising
that
he
was
instantly
aware
of
my
presence
i
could
not
leave
a
room
without
knowing
that
he
would
at
once
feel
and
regret
my
absence
the
one
fact
filled
and
completed
all
things
the
other
left
a
blank
which
could
not
be
removed
i
knew
this
and
yet
incredible
though
it
may
appear
i
did
not
realise
it
meant
love
i
thought
it
was
an
extraordinarily
close
bond
of
sympathy
and
mutual
understanding
brought
about
principally
by
our
enjoyment
of
one
another
music
we
spent
hours
in
the
i
put
it
down
to
that
yet
when
he
looked
at
me
his
eyes
seemed
to
touch
as
well
as
see
me
and
it
was
a
very
tender
and
wonderful
touch
and
all
the
while
i
never
thought
of
love
i
was
so
plain
and
almost
and
he
such
a
beautiful
radiant
youth
he
was
like
a
young
and
i
felt
warmed
and
vivified
when
he
was
near
and
he
was
almost
always
near
honestly
that
was
my
side
of
the
days
succeeding
the
concert
but
his
he
told
me
afterwards
deryck
it
had
been
a
sudden
revelation
to
him
when
he
heard
me
sing
the
rosary
not
of
music
only
but
of
me
he
said
he
had
never
thought
of
me
otherwise
than
as
a
good
sort
of
chum
but
then
it
was
as
if
a
veil
were
lifted
and
he
saw
and
knew
and
felt
me
as
a
woman
and
no
doubt
it
will
seem
odd
to
you
boy
it
did
to
me
but
he
said
that
the
woman
he
found
then
was
his
ideal
of
womanhood
and
that
from
that
hour
he
wanted
me
for
his
own
as
he
had
never
wanted
anything
before
jane
paused
and
looked
into
the
glowing
heart
of
the
fire
the
doctor
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
jane
he
himself
had
experienced
the
intense
attraction
of
her
womanliness
all
the
more
overpowering
when
it
was
realised
because
it
did
not
appear
upon
the
surface
he
had
sensed
the
strong
lying
dormant
within
her
had
known
that
her
arms
would
prove
a
haven
of
refuge
her
bosom
a
soothing
pillow
her
love
a
consolation
unspeakable
in
his
own
days
of
loneliness
and
disappointment
the
doctor
had
had
to
flee
from
this
in
jane
a
precious
gift
so
easy
to
have
taken
because
of
her
very
ignorance
of
it
but
a
gift
to
which
he
had
no
right
thus
the
doctor
could
well
understand
the
hold
it
would
gain
upon
a
man
who
had
discovered
it
and
who
was
free
to
win
it
for
his
own
but
he
only
said
i
do
not
think
it
odd
dear
jane
had
forgotten
the
doctor
she
came
back
promptly
from
the
glowing
heart
of
the
fire
i
am
glad
you
do
she
said
i
well
we
both
left
overdene
on
the
same
day
i
came
to
you
he
went
to
shenstone
it
was
a
tuesday
on
the
friday
i
went
down
to
shenstone
and
we
met
again
having
been
apart
for
a
little
while
seemed
to
make
this
curious
feeling
of
deeper
and
sweeter
than
ever
in
the
shenstone
house
party
was
that
lovely
american
girl
pauline
lister
garth
was
enthusiastic
about
her
beauty
and
set
on
painting
her
everybody
made
sure
he
was
going
to
propose
to
her
deryck
i
thought
so
too
in
fact
i
had
advised
him
to
do
it
i
felt
so
pleased
and
interested
over
it
though
all
the
while
his
eyes
touched
me
when
he
looked
at
me
and
i
knew
the
day
did
not
begin
for
him
until
we
had
met
and
was
over
when
we
had
said
and
this
experience
of
being
first
and
most
to
him
made
everything
so
golden
and
life
so
rich
and
still
i
thought
of
it
only
as
an
unusually
delightful
friendship
but
the
evening
of
my
arrival
at
shenstone
he
asked
me
to
come
out
on
to
the
terrace
after
dinner
as
he
wanted
specially
to
talk
to
me
deryck
i
thought
it
was
the
usual
proceeding
of
making
a
confidante
of
me
and
that
i
was
to
hear
details
of
his
intentions
regarding
miss
lister
thinking
that
i
walked
calmly
out
beside
him
sat
down
on
the
parapet
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
and
quietly
waited
for
him
to
begin
then
oh
deryck
it
happened
jane
put
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
buried
her
face
in
her
clasped
hands
i
can
not
tell
you
details
his
love
it
just
poured
over
me
like
molten
gold
it
melted
the
shell
of
my
reserve
it
burst
through
the
ice
of
my
convictions
it
swept
me
off
my
feet
upon
a
torrent
of
wondrous
fire
i
knew
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
but
that
this
love
was
mine
and
was
for
me
and
then
oh
deryck
i
ca
explain
i
know
myself
how
it
happened
but
this
whirlwind
of
emotion
came
to
rest
upon
my
heart
he
knelt
with
his
arms
around
me
and
we
held
each
other
in
a
sudden
great
stillness
and
in
that
moment
i
was
all
his
and
he
knew
it
he
might
have
stayed
there
hours
if
he
had
not
moved
or
spoken
but
presently
he
lifted
up
his
face
and
looked
at
me
then
he
said
two
words
i
ca
repeat
them
boy
but
they
brought
me
suddenly
to
my
senses
and
made
me
realise
what
it
all
meant
garth
dalmain
wanted
me
to
marry
him
jane
paused
awaiting
the
doctor
expression
of
surprise
what
else
could
it
have
meant
said
deryck
brand
very
quietly
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
lips
knowing
they
trembled
a
little
confessions
were
giving
him
a
stiffer
time
than
he
had
expected
well
dear
so
you
i
stood
up
said
jane
for
while
he
knelt
there
he
was
master
of
me
mind
and
body
and
some
instinct
told
me
that
if
i
were
to
be
won
to
wifehood
my
reason
must
say
before
the
rest
of
me
it
is
soul
and
body
in
the
word
not
soul
and
spirit
as
is
so
often
misquoted
and
i
believe
the
inspired
sequence
to
be
the
right
one
the
doctor
made
a
quick
movement
of
interest
good
heavens
jane
he
said
you
have
got
hold
of
a
truth
there
and
you
have
expressed
it
exactly
as
i
have
often
wanted
to
express
it
without
being
able
to
find
the
right
words
you
have
found
them
jeanette
she
looked
into
his
eager
eyes
and
smiled
sadly
have
i
boy
she
said
well
they
have
cost
me
i
put
my
lover
from
me
and
told
him
i
must
have
twelve
hours
for
calm
reflection
he
was
so
sure
so
sure
of
me
so
sure
of
himself
that
he
agreed
without
a
protest
at
my
request
he
left
me
at
once
the
manner
of
his
going
i
can
not
tell
even
to
you
dicky
i
promised
to
meet
him
at
the
village
church
next
day
and
give
him
my
answer
he
was
to
try
the
new
organ
at
eleven
we
knew
we
should
be
alone
i
came
he
sent
away
the
blower
he
called
me
to
him
at
the
chancel
step
the
setting
was
so
perfect
the
artist
in
him
sang
for
joy
and
thrilled
with
expectation
the
glory
of
absolute
certainty
was
in
his
eyes
though
he
had
himself
well
in
hand
he
kept
from
touching
me
while
he
asked
for
my
answer
then
i
refused
him
point
blank
giving
a
reason
he
could
not
question
he
turned
from
me
and
left
the
church
and
i
have
not
spoken
to
him
from
that
day
to
this
a
long
silence
in
the
doctor
one
manly
heart
was
entering
into
the
pain
of
another
and
yet
striving
not
to
be
indignant
until
he
knew
the
whole
truth
jane
spirit
was
strung
up
to
the
same
pitch
as
in
that
fateful
hour
and
once
more
she
thought
herself
right
at
last
the
doctor
spoke
he
looked
at
her
searchingly
now
and
held
her
eyes
and
why
did
you
refuse
him
jane
the
kind
voice
was
rather
stern
jane
put
out
her
hands
to
him
appealingly
ah
boy
i
must
make
you
understand
how
could
i
do
otherwise
though
indeed
it
was
putting
away
the
highest
good
life
will
ever
hold
for
me
deryck
you
know
garth
well
enough
to
realise
how
dependent
he
is
on
beauty
he
must
be
surrounded
by
it
perpetually
before
this
unaccountable
need
of
each
other
came
to
us
he
had
talked
to
me
quite
freely
on
this
point
saying
of
a
plain
person
whose
character
and
gifts
he
greatly
admired
and
whose
face
he
grew
to
like
in
consequence
of
course
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
would
have
wanted
to
live
with
or
to
have
day
after
day
opposite
to
one
at
table
but
then
one
was
not
called
to
that
sort
of
discipline
which
would
be
martyrdom
to
me
oh
deryck
could
i
have
tied
garth
to
my
plain
face
could
i
have
let
myself
become
a
daily
hourly
discipline
to
that
radiant
nature
i
know
they
say
is
blind
but
that
is
before
love
has
entered
into
his
kingdom
love
desirous
sees
only
that
in
the
one
beloved
which
has
awakened
the
desire
but
love
content
regains
full
vision
and
as
time
goes
on
those
powers
of
vision
increase
and
become
by
means
of
daily
hourly
use
microscopic
and
telescopic
wedded
love
is
not
blind
bah
an
outsider
staying
with
married
people
is
apt
to
hear
what
love
sees
on
both
sides
and
the
delusion
of
love
blindness
is
dispelled
forever
i
know
garth
was
blind
during
all
those
golden
days
to
my
utter
lack
of
beauty
because
he
wanted
me
so
much
but
when
he
had
had
me
and
had
steeped
himself
in
all
i
have
to
give
of
soul
and
spirit
beauty
when
the
daily
routine
of
life
began
which
after
all
has
to
be
lived
in
complexions
and
with
features
to
the
fore
when
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
and
i
saw
him
glance
at
me
and
then
look
away
when
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
sitting
behind
the
looking
my
very
plainest
and
that
in
consequence
my
discipline
had
begun
could
i
have
borne
it
should
i
not
in
the
miserable
sense
of
failing
him
day
by
day
through
no
fault
of
my
own
have
grown
plainer
and
plainer
until
bitterness
and
disappointment
and
perhaps
jealousy
all
combined
to
make
me
positively
ugly
i
ask
you
deryck
could
i
have
borne
it
the
doctor
was
looking
at
jane
with
an
expression
of
keen
professional
interest
how
awfully
well
i
diagnosed
the
case
when
i
sent
you
abroad
he
remarked
meditatively
really
with
so
little
data
to
go
upon
oh
boy
cried
jane
with
a
movement
of
impatience
do
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
patient
treat
me
as
a
human
being
at
least
and
tell
me
as
man
to
man
could
i
have
tied
garth
dalmain
to
my
plain
face
for
you
know
it
is
plain
the
doctor
laughed
he
was
glad
to
make
jane
a
little
angry
my
dear
girl
he
said
were
we
speaking
as
man
to
man
i
should
have
a
few
very
strong
things
to
say
to
you
as
we
are
speaking
as
man
to
woman
and
as
a
man
who
has
for
a
very
long
time
respected
honoured
and
admired
a
very
dear
and
noble
woman
i
will
answer
your
question
frankly
you
are
not
beautiful
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
and
no
one
who
really
loves
you
would
answer
otherwise
because
no
one
who
knows
and
loves
you
would
dream
of
telling
you
a
lie
we
will
even
allow
if
you
like
that
you
are
plain
although
i
know
half
a
dozen
young
men
who
were
they
here
would
want
to
kick
me
into
the
street
for
saying
so
and
i
should
have
to
pretend
in
that
their
ears
had
played
them
false
and
i
had
said
are
jane
which
is
all
they
would
consider
mattered
so
long
as
you
are
yourself
your
friends
will
be
well
content
at
the
same
time
i
may
add
while
this
dear
face
is
under
discussion
that
i
can
look
back
to
times
when
i
have
felt
that
i
would
gladly
walk
twenty
miles
for
a
sight
of
it
and
in
its
absence
i
have
always
wished
it
present
and
in
its
presence
i
have
never
wished
it
away
ah
but
deryck
you
did
not
have
to
have
it
always
opposite
you
at
meals
insisted
jane
gravely
unfortunately
not
but
i
enjoyed
the
meals
more
on
the
happy
occasions
when
it
was
there
and
deryck
you
did
not
have
to
kiss
it
the
doctor
threw
back
his
head
and
shouted
with
laughter
so
that
flower
passing
up
the
stairs
wondered
what
turn
the
conversation
could
be
taking
but
jane
was
quite
serious
and
saw
in
it
no
laughing
matter
no
dear
said
the
doctor
when
he
had
recovered
to
my
infinite
credit
be
it
recorded
that
in
all
the
years
i
have
known
it
i
have
never
once
kissed
it
dicky
do
tease
oh
boy
it
is
the
most
vital
question
of
my
whole
life
and
if
you
do
not
now
give
me
wise
and
thoughtful
advice
all
this
difficult
confession
will
have
been
for
nothing
the
doctor
became
grave
immediately
he
leaned
forward
and
took
those
clasped
hands
between
his
dear
he
said
forgive
me
if
i
seemed
to
take
it
lightly
my
most
earnest
thought
is
wholly
at
your
disposal
and
now
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
how
did
you
ever
succeed
in
convincing
dalmain
that
such
a
thing
as
this
was
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
your
marriage
i
did
not
give
it
as
a
reason
what
then
did
you
give
as
your
reason
for
refusing
him
i
asked
him
how
old
he
was
jane
standing
there
beside
him
in
the
chancel
where
he
had
come
awaiting
your
answer
yes
it
did
seem
awful
when
i
came
to
think
it
over
afterwards
but
it
worked
i
have
no
doubt
it
worked
what
then
he
said
he
was
i
said
i
was
thirty
and
looked
and
felt
forty
i
also
said
he
might
be
but
he
looked
nineteen
and
i
was
sure
he
often
felt
nine
well
then
i
said
that
i
could
not
marry
a
mere
boy
and
he
acquiesced
he
seemed
stunned
at
first
then
he
said
of
course
i
could
not
marry
him
if
i
considered
him
that
he
said
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
given
a
thought
to
himself
in
the
matter
then
he
said
he
bowed
to
my
decision
and
he
walked
down
the
church
and
went
out
and
we
have
not
met
since
jane
said
the
doctor
i
wonder
he
did
not
see
through
it
you
are
so
unused
to
lying
that
you
can
not
have
lied
on
the
chancel
step
to
the
man
you
loved
with
much
conviction
a
dull
red
crept
up
beneath
jane
tan
oh
deryck
it
was
not
entirely
a
lie
it
was
one
of
those
dreadful
lies
which
are
a
truth
of
which
tennyson
says
that
they
are
harder
matter
to
fight
lie
which
is
all
a
lie
may
be
met
and
fought
with
outright
but
a
lie
which
is
part
a
truth
is
a
harder
matter
to
fight
quoted
the
doctor
yes
said
jane
and
he
could
not
fight
this
just
because
it
was
partly
true
he
is
younger
than
i
by
three
years
and
still
more
by
temperament
it
was
partly
for
his
delightful
youthfulness
that
i
feared
my
maturity
and
staidness
it
was
part
a
truth
but
oh
deryck
it
was
more
a
lie
and
it
was
altogether
a
lie
to
call
him
the
man
whom
i
had
felt
complete
master
of
me
the
evening
before
mere
boy
also
he
could
not
fight
it
because
it
took
him
so
utterly
by
surprise
he
had
been
all
the
time
as
completely
without
as
i
had
been
morbidly
full
of
it
his
whole
thought
had
been
of
me
mine
had
been
of
him
and
of
myself
jane
said
the
doctor
of
all
that
you
have
suffered
since
that
hour
you
deserved
every
pang
jane
bent
her
head
i
know
she
said
you
were
false
to
yourself
and
not
true
to
your
lover
you
robbed
and
defrauded
both
can
not
you
now
see
your
mistake
to
take
it
on
the
lowest
ground
dalmain
worshipper
of
beauty
as
he
was
had
had
a
surfeit
of
pretty
faces
he
was
like
the
confectioner
boy
who
when
first
engaged
is
allowed
to
eat
all
the
cakes
and
sweets
he
likes
and
who
eats
so
many
in
the
first
week
that
ever
after
he
wants
only
plain
you
were
dal
i
am
sorry
if
you
do
not
like
the
simile
jane
smiled
i
do
like
the
simile
she
said
ah
but
you
were
far
more
than
this
my
dear
girl
you
were
his
ideal
of
womanhood
he
believed
in
your
strength
and
tenderness
your
graciousness
and
truth
you
shattered
this
ideal
you
failed
this
faith
in
you
his
fanciful
artistic
eclectic
nature
with
all
its
unused
possibilities
of
faithful
and
passionate
devotion
had
found
its
haven
in
your
love
and
in
twelve
hours
you
turned
it
adrift
jane
it
was
a
crime
the
magnificent
strength
of
the
fellow
is
shown
by
the
way
he
took
it
his
progress
in
his
art
was
not
arrested
all
his
best
work
has
been
done
since
he
has
made
no
bad
mad
marriage
in
mockery
of
his
own
pain
and
no
grand
loveless
one
to
spite
you
he
might
have
done
both
i
mean
either
and
when
i
realise
that
the
poor
fellow
i
was
with
yesterday
making
such
a
brave
fight
in
the
dark
and
turning
his
head
on
the
pillow
to
say
with
a
gleam
of
hope
on
his
drawn
face
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
had
already
been
put
through
all
this
by
you
jane
if
you
were
a
man
i
horsewhip
you
said
the
doctor
jane
squared
her
shoulders
and
lifted
her
head
with
more
of
her
old
spirit
than
she
had
yet
shown
you
have
lashed
me
well
boy
she
said
as
only
words
spoken
in
faithful
indignation
can
lash
and
i
feel
the
better
for
the
and
now
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
while
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
great
pyramid
i
suddenly
saw
the
matter
from
a
different
standpoint
you
remember
that
view
with
its
sharp
line
of
demarcation
on
one
side
the
river
and
verdure
vegetation
fruitfulness
a
veritable
enclosed
on
the
other
vast
space
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
golden
liberty
away
to
the
horizon
but
no
sign
of
vegetation
no
hope
of
cultivation
just
barren
arid
loneliness
i
felt
this
was
an
exact
picture
of
my
life
as
i
live
it
now
garth
love
flowing
through
it
as
the
river
could
have
made
it
a
veritable
of
the
lord
it
would
have
meant
less
liberty
but
it
would
also
have
meant
no
loneliness
and
after
all
the
liberty
to
live
for
self
alone
becomes
in
time
a
weary
bondage
then
i
realised
that
i
had
condemned
him
also
to
this
hard
desert
life
i
came
down
and
took
counsel
of
the
old
sphinx
those
calm
wise
eyes
looking
on
into
futurity
seemed
to
say
only
live
who
love
that
evening
i
resolved
to
give
up
the
nile
trip
return
home
immediately
send
for
garth
admit
all
to
him
asking
him
to
let
us
both
begin
again
just
where
we
were
three
years
ago
in
the
moonlight
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
ten
minutes
after
i
had
formed
this
decision
i
heard
of
his
accident
the
doctor
shaded
his
face
with
his
hand
the
wheels
of
time
he
said
in
a
low
voice
move
forward
always
backward
never
oh
deryck
cried
jane
sometimes
they
do
you
and
flower
know
that
sometimes
they
do
the
doctor
smiled
sadly
and
very
tenderly
i
know
he
said
that
there
is
always
one
exception
which
proves
every
rule
then
he
added
quickly
but
unquestionably
it
helps
to
mend
matters
so
far
as
your
own
mental
attitude
is
concerned
that
before
you
knew
of
blindness
you
should
have
admitted
yourself
wrong
and
made
up
your
mind
to
trust
him
i
do
know
that
i
was
altogether
clear
about
having
been
wrong
said
jane
but
i
was
quite
convinced
that
i
could
live
any
longer
without
him
and
was
therefore
prepared
to
risk
it
and
of
course
now
all
doubt
or
need
to
question
is
swept
away
by
my
poor
boy
accident
which
simplifies
matters
where
that
particular
point
is
concerned
the
doctor
looked
at
jane
with
a
sudden
raising
of
his
level
brows
simplifies
matters
he
said
then
as
jane
apparently
satisfied
with
the
expression
did
not
attempt
to
qualify
it
he
rose
and
stirred
the
fire
standing
over
it
for
a
few
moments
in
silent
thought
when
he
sat
down
again
his
voice
was
very
quiet
but
there
was
an
alertness
about
his
expression
which
roused
jane
she
felt
that
the
crisis
of
their
conversation
had
been
reached
and
now
my
dear
jeanette
said
the
doctor
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
intend
doing
doing
said
jane
why
of
course
i
shall
go
straight
to
garth
i
only
want
you
to
advise
me
how
best
to
let
him
know
i
am
coming
and
whether
it
is
safe
for
him
to
have
the
emotion
of
my
arrival
also
i
do
want
to
risk
being
kept
from
him
by
doctors
or
nurses
my
place
is
by
his
side
i
ask
no
better
thing
of
life
than
to
be
always
beside
him
but
attendants
are
apt
to
be
and
a
fuss
under
these
circumstances
would
be
unbearable
a
wire
from
you
will
make
all
clear
i
see
said
the
doctor
slowly
yes
a
wire
from
me
will
undoubtedly
open
a
way
for
you
to
garth
dalmain
bedside
and
arrived
there
what
then
a
smile
of
ineffable
tenderness
parted
jane
lips
the
doctor
saw
it
but
turned
away
immediately
it
was
not
for
him
or
for
any
man
to
see
that
look
the
eyes
which
should
have
seen
it
were
sightless
evermore
what
then
deryck
love
will
know
best
what
then
all
barriers
will
be
swept
away
and
garth
and
i
will
be
together
the
doctor
met
very
exactly
before
he
spoke
again
and
when
he
did
speak
his
tone
was
very
level
and
very
kind
ah
jane
he
said
that
is
the
woman
point
of
view
it
is
certainly
the
simplest
and
perhaps
the
best
but
at
garth
bedside
you
will
be
confronted
with
the
man
point
of
view
and
i
should
be
failing
the
trust
you
have
placed
in
me
did
i
not
put
that
before
you
from
the
man
point
of
view
your
own
mistaken
action
three
years
ago
has
placed
you
now
in
an
almost
impossible
position
if
you
go
to
garth
with
the
simple
offer
of
your
love
the
treasure
he
asked
three
years
ago
and
failed
to
win
he
will
naturally
conclude
the
love
now
given
is
mainly
pity
and
garth
dalmain
is
not
the
man
to
be
content
with
pity
where
he
has
thought
to
win
love
and
failed
nor
would
he
allow
any
woman
least
of
all
his
crown
of
womanhood
to
tie
herself
to
his
blindness
unless
he
were
sure
such
binding
was
her
deepest
joy
and
how
could
you
expect
him
to
believe
this
in
face
of
the
fact
that
when
he
was
all
a
woman
heart
could
desire
you
refused
him
and
sent
him
from
you
if
on
the
other
hand
you
explain
as
no
doubt
you
intend
to
do
the
reason
of
that
refusal
he
can
but
say
one
thing
could
not
trust
me
to
be
faithful
when
i
had
my
sight
blind
you
come
to
me
when
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
to
prove
my
fidelity
there
is
no
virtue
in
necessity
i
can
never
feel
i
possess
your
trust
because
you
come
to
me
only
when
accident
has
put
it
out
of
my
power
either
to
do
the
thing
you
feared
or
to
prove
myself
better
than
your
doubts
my
dear
girl
that
is
how
matters
stand
from
the
man
point
of
view
from
his
i
make
no
doubt
even
more
than
from
mine
for
i
recognise
in
garth
dalmain
a
stronger
man
than
myself
had
it
been
i
that
day
in
the
church
wanting
you
as
he
did
i
should
have
grovelled
at
your
feet
and
promised
to
grow
up
garth
dalmain
had
the
iron
strength
to
turn
and
go
without
a
protest
when
the
woman
who
had
owned
him
mate
the
evening
before
refused
him
on
the
score
of
inadequacy
the
next
morning
i
fear
there
is
no
question
of
the
view
he
would
take
of
the
situation
as
it
now
stands
jane
pale
startled
face
went
to
the
doctor
heart
but
deryck
he
loves
just
because
he
loves
my
poor
old
girl
where
you
are
concerned
he
could
never
be
content
with
less
than
the
best
oh
boy
help
me
find
a
way
tell
me
what
to
do
despair
was
in
jane
eyes
the
doctor
considered
long
in
silence
at
last
he
said
i
see
only
one
way
out
if
dal
could
somehow
be
brought
to
realise
your
point
of
view
at
that
time
as
a
possible
one
without
knowing
it
had
actually
been
the
cause
of
your
refusal
of
him
and
could
have
the
chance
to
express
himself
clearly
on
the
subject
to
me
for
instance
in
a
way
which
might
reach
you
without
being
meant
to
reach
you
it
might
put
you
in
a
better
position
toward
him
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
manage
if
you
could
be
in
close
contact
with
his
mind
constantly
near
him
unseen
ah
poor
chap
that
is
easy
now
i
mean
unknown
to
him
if
for
instance
you
could
be
in
the
shoes
of
this
person
i
am
sending
him
and
get
at
his
mind
on
the
matter
so
that
he
could
feel
when
you
eventually
made
your
confession
he
had
already
justified
himself
to
you
and
thus
gone
behind
his
blindness
as
it
were
jane
bounded
in
her
chair
deryck
i
have
it
oh
send
me
as
his
he
would
never
dream
it
was
i
it
is
three
years
since
he
heard
my
voice
and
he
thinks
me
in
egypt
the
society
column
in
all
the
papers
a
few
weeks
ago
mentioned
me
as
wintering
in
egypt
and
syria
and
remaining
abroad
until
may
not
a
soul
knows
i
have
come
home
you
are
the
best
judge
as
to
whether
i
have
had
training
and
experience
and
all
through
the
war
our
work
was
fully
as
much
mental
and
spiritual
as
surgical
it
was
not
up
to
much
otherwise
oh
dicky
you
could
safely
recommend
me
and
i
still
have
my
uniforms
stowed
away
in
case
of
need
i
could
be
ready
in
hours
and
i
would
go
as
sister
anything
and
eat
in
the
kitchen
if
necessary
but
my
dear
girl
said
the
doctor
quietly
you
could
not
go
as
sister
anything
unfortunately
you
could
only
go
as
nurse
rosemary
gray
for
i
engaged
her
this
morning
and
posted
a
full
and
explicit
account
of
her
to
mackenzie
which
he
will
read
to
our
patient
i
never
take
a
case
from
one
nurse
and
give
it
to
another
excepting
for
incompetency
and
nurse
rosemary
gray
could
more
easily
fly
than
prove
incompetent
she
will
not
be
required
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
she
is
a
gentlewoman
and
will
be
treated
as
such
i
wish
indeed
you
could
be
in
her
shoes
though
i
doubt
whether
you
could
have
carried
it
through
and
now
i
have
something
to
tell
you
just
before
i
left
him
dalmain
asked
after
you
he
sandwiched
you
most
carefully
in
between
the
duchess
and
flower
but
he
could
not
keep
the
blood
out
of
his
thin
cheeks
and
he
gripped
the
bedclothes
in
his
effort
to
keep
his
voice
steady
he
asked
where
you
were
i
said
i
believed
in
egypt
when
you
were
coming
home
i
told
him
i
had
heard
you
intended
returning
to
jerusalem
for
easter
and
i
supposed
we
might
expect
you
home
at
the
end
of
april
or
early
in
may
he
inquired
how
you
were
i
replied
that
you
were
not
a
good
correspondent
but
i
gathered
from
occasional
cables
and
that
you
were
very
fit
and
having
a
good
time
i
then
volunteered
the
statement
that
it
was
i
who
had
sent
you
abroad
because
you
were
going
all
to
pieces
he
made
a
quick
movement
with
his
hand
as
if
he
would
have
struck
me
for
using
the
expression
then
he
said
to
pieces
she
in
a
tone
of
most
utter
contempt
for
me
and
my
opinions
then
he
hastily
made
minute
inquiries
for
flower
he
had
already
asked
about
the
duchess
all
the
questions
he
intended
asking
about
you
when
he
had
ascertained
that
flower
was
at
home
and
well
and
had
sent
him
her
affectionate
sympathy
he
begged
me
to
glance
through
a
pile
of
letters
which
were
waiting
until
he
felt
able
to
have
them
read
to
him
and
to
tell
him
any
of
the
handwritings
known
to
me
all
the
world
seemed
to
have
sent
him
letters
of
sympathy
poor
chap
i
told
him
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
names
i
knew
a
royal
handwriting
among
them
he
asked
whether
there
were
any
from
abroad
there
were
two
or
three
i
knew
them
all
and
named
them
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
any
of
them
read
even
the
royal
letter
remained
unopened
though
he
asked
to
have
it
in
his
hand
and
fingered
the
tiny
crimson
crown
then
he
asked
there
one
from
the
duchess
there
was
he
wished
to
hear
that
one
so
i
opened
and
read
it
it
was
very
characteristic
of
her
grace
full
of
kindly
sympathy
heartily
yet
tactfully
expressed
through
she
said
will
be
upset
i
shall
write
and
tell
her
next
time
she
sends
me
an
address
at
present
i
have
no
idea
in
which
quarter
of
the
globe
my
dear
niece
is
to
be
found
last
time
i
heard
of
her
she
seemed
in
a
fair
way
towards
marrying
a
little
jap
and
settling
in
japan
not
a
bad
idea
my
dear
dal
is
it
though
if
japan
is
at
all
like
the
paper
screens
i
know
where
in
that
liliputian
country
they
will
find
a
house
or
a
husband
or
a
thing
they
ride
in
solid
enough
for
our
good
jane
with
intuitive
tact
of
a
very
high
order
i
omitted
this
entire
passage
about
marrying
the
jap
when
your
aunt
letter
was
finished
he
asked
point
blank
whether
there
was
one
from
you
i
said
no
but
that
it
was
unlikely
the
news
had
reached
you
and
i
felt
sure
you
would
write
when
it
did
so
i
hope
you
will
dear
and
nurse
rosemary
gray
will
have
instructions
to
read
all
his
letters
to
him
oh
deryck
said
jane
brokenly
i
ca
bear
it
i
must
go
to
him
the
telephone
bell
on
the
doctor
table
whirred
sharply
he
went
over
and
took
up
the
receiver
hullo
yes
it
is
dr
brand
who
is
speaking
oh
is
it
you
matron
jane
felt
quite
sorry
the
matron
could
not
see
the
doctor
charming
smile
into
the
yes
what
name
did
you
say
undoubtedly
this
morning
quite
definitely
a
most
important
case
she
is
to
call
and
see
me
what
mistake
on
register
ah
i
see
gone
where
where
spell
it
please
australia
oh
quite
out
of
reach
yes
i
heard
he
was
ordered
there
never
mind
matron
you
are
in
no
way
to
blame
thanks
i
think
not
i
have
some
one
in
view
yes
yes
no
doubt
she
might
do
i
will
let
you
know
if
i
should
require
her
matron
and
thank
you
the
doctor
hung
up
the
receiver
then
he
turned
to
jane
a
slow
smile
gathering
on
his
lips
jeanette
he
said
i
do
not
believe
in
chance
but
i
do
believe
in
a
higher
control
which
makes
and
unmakes
our
plans
you
shall
go
chapter
xvi
the
doctor
finds
a
way
and
now
as
to
ways
and
means
said
the
doctor
when
jane
felt
better
you
must
leave
by
the
night
mail
from
euston
the
day
after
can
you
be
ready
i
am
ready
said
jane
you
must
go
as
nurse
rosemary
gray
i
do
like
that
jane
interposed
i
should
prefer
a
fictitious
name
suppose
the
real
rosemary
gray
turned
up
or
some
one
who
knows
her
my
dear
girl
she
is
to
australia
by
now
and
you
will
see
no
one
up
there
but
the
household
and
the
doctor
any
one
who
turned
up
would
be
more
likely
to
know
you
we
must
take
these
risks
besides
in
case
of
complications
arising
i
will
give
you
a
note
which
you
can
produce
at
once
explaining
the
situation
and
stating
that
in
agreeing
to
fill
the
breach
you
consented
at
my
request
to
take
the
name
in
order
to
prevent
any
necessity
for
explanations
to
the
patient
which
at
this
particular
juncture
would
be
most
prejudicial
i
can
honestly
say
this
it
being
even
more
true
than
appears
so
you
must
dress
the
part
jane
and
endeavour
to
look
the
part
so
far
as
your
five
foot
eleven
will
permit
for
please
remember
that
i
have
described
you
to
mackenzie
as
pretty
dainty
little
thing
refined
and
elegant
and
considerably
more
capable
than
she
looks
dicky
he
will
instantly
realise
that
i
am
not
the
person
mentioned
in
your
letter
not
so
dear
remember
we
have
to
do
with
a
scotchman
and
a
scotchman
never
realises
anything
the
gaelic
mind
works
slowly
though
it
works
exceeding
sure
he
will
be
exceeding
sure
when
he
has
contemplated
you
for
a
while
that
i
am
a
poor
judge
o
women
and
that
nurse
gray
is
a
far
finer
woman
than
i
described
but
he
will
have
already
created
for
dalmain
from
my
letter
a
mental
picture
of
his
nurse
which
is
all
that
really
matters
we
must
trust
to
providence
that
old
robbie
does
not
proceed
to
amend
it
by
the
original
try
to
forestall
any
such
conversation
if
the
good
doctor
seems
to
mistrust
you
take
him
on
one
side
show
him
my
letter
and
tell
him
the
simple
truth
but
i
do
not
suppose
this
will
be
necessary
with
the
patient
you
must
remember
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
a
blind
man
hearing
tread
lightly
do
not
give
him
any
opportunity
to
judge
of
your
height
try
to
remember
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
reach
the
top
shelf
of
an
bookcase
without
the
aid
of
steps
or
a
chair
and
when
the
patient
begins
to
stand
and
walk
try
to
keep
him
from
finding
out
that
his
nurse
is
slightly
taller
than
himself
this
should
not
be
difficult
one
of
his
fixed
ideas
being
that
in
his
blindness
he
will
not
be
touched
by
a
woman
his
valet
will
lead
him
about
and
jane
i
can
not
imagine
any
one
who
has
ever
had
your
hand
in
his
failing
to
recognise
it
so
i
advise
you
from
the
first
to
avoid
shaking
hands
but
all
these
precautions
do
not
obviate
the
greatest
difficulty
of
all
your
voice
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
he
will
not
recognise
that
i
shall
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
in
that
case
said
jane
and
you
must
help
me
explain
the
fact
to
me
now
as
you
might
do
if
i
were
really
nurse
rosemary
gray
and
had
a
voice
so
like
my
own
the
doctor
smiled
my
dear
nurse
rosemary
he
said
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
our
patient
detects
a
remarkable
similarity
between
your
voice
and
that
of
a
mutual
friend
of
his
and
mine
i
have
constantly
noticed
it
myself
indeed
sir
said
jane
and
may
i
know
whose
voice
mine
so
closely
resembles
the
honourable
jane
champion
said
the
doctor
with
the
delightful
smile
with
which
he
always
spoke
to
his
nurses
do
you
know
her
slightly
said
jane
and
i
hope
to
know
her
better
and
better
as
the
years
go
by
then
they
both
laughed
thank
you
dicky
now
i
shall
know
what
to
say
to
the
ah
but
the
misery
of
it
think
of
it
being
possible
thus
to
deceive
garth
garth
of
the
bright
keen
all
perceiving
vision
shall
i
ever
have
the
courage
to
carry
it
through
if
you
value
your
own
eventual
happiness
and
his
you
will
dear
and
now
i
must
order
the
brougham
and
speed
you
to
portland
place
or
you
will
be
late
for
dinner
a
thing
the
duchess
can
not
overlook
you
very
well
know
even
in
a
traveller
returned
from
round
the
world
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
tell
your
kind
sensible
old
aunt
the
whole
story
omitting
of
course
all
moonlight
details
and
consult
her
about
this
plan
her
shrewd
counsel
will
be
invaluable
and
you
may
be
glad
of
her
assistance
later
on
they
rose
and
faced
each
other
on
the
boy
said
jane
with
emotion
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
and
so
faithful
whatever
happens
i
shall
be
grateful
always
hush
said
the
doctor
no
need
for
gratitude
when
debts
are
i
shall
not
have
a
free
moment
and
i
foresee
the
next
day
as
very
full
also
but
we
might
dine
together
at
euston
at
seven
and
i
will
see
you
off
your
train
leaves
at
eight
getting
you
to
aberdeen
soon
after
seven
the
next
morning
and
out
to
gleneesh
in
time
for
breakfast
you
will
enjoy
arriving
in
the
early
morning
light
and
the
air
of
the
moors
braces
you
thank
you
stoddart
miss
champion
is
ready
hullo
flower
look
up
jane
flower
and
dicky
and
blossom
are
hanging
over
the
topmost
banisters
dropping
you
showers
of
kisses
yes
the
river
you
mentioned
does
produce
a
veritable
of
the
lord
god
send
you
the
same
dear
and
now
sit
well
back
and
lower
your
veil
ah
i
remember
you
do
wear
them
wise
girl
if
all
women
followed
your
example
it
would
impoverish
the
opticians
why
oh
constant
focussing
on
spots
for
one
thing
but
lean
back
for
you
must
not
be
seen
if
you
are
supposed
to
be
still
in
cairo
waiting
to
go
up
the
nile
and
look
here
the
doctor
put
his
head
in
at
the
carriage
window
very
plain
luggage
mind
the
sort
of
thing
nurses
speak
of
as
box
with
a
very
obvious
on
it
thank
you
boy
whispered
jane
you
think
of
everything
i
think
of
you
said
the
doctor
and
in
all
the
hard
days
to
come
jane
often
found
comfort
in
remembering
those
last
quiet
words
chapter
xvii
enter
nurse
rosemary
nurse
rosemary
gray
had
arrived
at
gleneesh
when
she
and
her
box
were
deposited
on
the
platform
of
the
little
wayside
railway
station
she
felt
she
had
indeed
dropped
from
the
clouds
leaving
her
own
world
and
her
own
identity
on
some
planet
a
motor
waited
outside
the
station
and
she
had
a
momentary
fear
lest
she
should
receive
deferential
recognition
from
the
chauffeur
but
he
was
as
solid
and
stolid
as
any
other
portion
of
the
car
and
paid
no
more
attention
to
her
than
he
did
to
her
baggage
the
one
was
a
nurse
the
other
a
box
both
common
nouns
and
merely
articles
to
be
conveyed
to
gleneesh
according
to
orders
so
he
looked
straight
before
him
presenting
a
profile
beneath
the
peak
of
his
leather
cap
while
a
slow
and
solemn
porter
helped
jane
and
her
luggage
into
the
motor
when
she
had
rewarded
the
porter
with
threepence
conscientiously
endeavouring
to
live
down
to
her
box
the
chauffeur
moved
foot
and
hand
with
the
silent
precision
of
a
machine
they
swung
round
into
the
open
and
took
the
road
for
the
hills
up
into
the
fragrant
heather
and
grey
rocks
miles
of
moor
and
sky
and
solitude
more
than
ever
jane
felt
as
if
she
had
dropped
into
another
world
and
so
small
an
incident
as
the
omission
of
the
usual
respectful
salute
of
a
servant
gave
her
a
delightful
sense
of
success
and
security
in
her
new
role
she
had
often
heard
of
garth
old
castle
up
in
the
north
an
inheritance
from
his
mother
family
but
was
hardly
prepared
for
so
much
picturesque
beauty
or
such
stateliness
of
archway
and
entrance
as
they
wound
up
the
hillside
and
the
grey
turrets
came
into
view
with
pine
woods
behind
and
above
she
seemed
to
hear
garth
boyish
voice
under
the
cedar
at
overdene
with
its
ring
of
buoyant
enjoyment
saying
i
should
like
you
to
see
castle
gleneesh
you
would
enjoy
the
view
from
the
terrace
and
the
pine
woods
and
the
moor
and
then
he
had
laughingly
declared
his
intention
of
getting
up
a
best
party
of
his
own
with
the
duchess
as
chaperon
and
she
had
promised
to
make
one
of
it
and
now
he
the
owner
of
all
this
loveliness
was
blind
and
helpless
and
she
was
entering
the
fair
portals
of
gleneesh
unknown
to
him
unrecognised
by
any
as
a
sort
of
person
jane
had
said
at
overdene
yes
ask
us
and
see
what
happens
and
now
this
was
happening
what
would
happen
next
garth
man
simpson
received
her
at
the
door
and
again
a
possible
danger
was
safely
passed
he
had
entered
garth
service
within
the
last
three
years
and
evidently
did
not
know
her
by
sight
jane
stood
looking
round
the
old
hall
in
the
leisurely
way
of
one
accustomed
to
arrive
for
the
first
time
as
guest
at
the
country
homes
of
her
friends
noting
the
quaint
large
fireplace
and
the
shadowy
antlers
high
up
on
the
walls
then
she
became
aware
that
simpson
already
up
the
wide
oak
staircase
was
expecting
the
nurse
to
hurry
after
him
this
she
did
and
was
received
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
by
old
margery
it
did
not
require
the
lawn
kerchief
the
black
satin
apron
and
the
lavender
ribbons
for
jane
to
recognise
garth
old
scotch
nurse
housekeeper
and
friend
one
glance
at
the
grave
kindly
face
wrinkled
and
rosy
a
beautiful
combination
of
perfect
health
and
advancing
years
was
enough
the
shrewd
keen
eyes
seeing
quickly
beneath
the
surface
were
unmistakable
she
conducted
jane
to
her
room
talking
all
the
time
in
a
kindly
effort
to
set
her
at
her
ease
and
to
express
a
warm
welcome
with
gentle
dignity
not
forgetting
the
cloud
of
sadness
which
hung
over
the
house
and
rendered
her
presence
necessary
she
called
her
nurse
gray
at
the
conclusion
of
every
sentence
with
an
upward
inflection
and
pretty
rolling
of
the
r
which
charmed
jane
she
longed
to
say
you
old
dear
how
i
shall
enjoy
being
in
the
house
with
you
but
remembered
in
time
that
a
remark
which
would
have
been
gratifying
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
honourable
jane
champion
would
be
little
short
of
impertinent
familiarity
from
nurse
rosemary
gray
so
she
followed
meekly
into
the
pretty
room
prepared
for
her
admired
the
chintz
answered
questions
about
her
night
journey
admitted
that
she
would
be
very
glad
of
breakfast
but
still
more
of
a
bath
if
convenient
and
now
bath
and
breakfast
were
both
over
and
jane
was
standing
beside
the
window
in
her
room
looking
down
at
the
wonderful
view
and
waiting
until
the
local
doctor
should
arrive
and
summon
her
to
garth
room
she
had
put
on
the
and
most
of
her
uniforms
a
blue
print
gown
linen
collar
and
cuffs
and
a
white
apron
with
shoulder
straps
and
large
pockets
she
also
wore
the
becoming
cap
belonging
to
one
of
the
institutions
to
which
she
had
once
been
for
training
she
did
not
intend
wearing
this
later
on
but
just
this
morning
she
omitted
no
detail
which
could
impress
mackenzie
with
her
extremely
professional
appearance
she
was
painfully
conscious
that
the
severe
simplicity
of
her
dress
tended
rather
to
add
to
her
height
notwithstanding
her
ward
shoes
with
their
noiseless
rubber
soles
she
could
but
hope
deryck
would
prove
right
as
to
the
view
mackenzie
would
take
and
then
far
away
in
the
distance
along
the
white
ribbon
of
road
winding
up
from
the
valley
she
saw
a
high
gig
trotting
swiftly
one
man
in
it
and
a
small
groom
seated
behind
her
hour
had
come
jane
fell
upon
her
knees
at
the
window
and
prayed
for
strength
wisdom
and
courage
she
could
realise
absolutely
nothing
she
had
thought
so
much
and
so
continuously
that
all
mental
vision
was
out
of
focus
and
had
become
a
blur
even
his
dear
face
had
faded
and
was
hidden
from
her
when
she
frantically
strove
to
recall
it
to
her
mental
view
only
the
actual
fact
remained
clear
that
in
a
few
short
minutes
she
would
be
taken
to
the
room
where
he
lay
she
would
see
the
face
she
had
not
seen
since
they
stood
together
at
the
chancel
step
the
face
from
which
the
glad
confidence
slowly
faded
a
horror
of
chill
disillusion
taking
its
place
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
with
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
she
would
see
that
dear
face
and
he
sightless
would
not
see
hers
but
would
be
easily
deluded
into
believing
her
to
be
some
one
else
the
gig
had
turned
the
last
bend
of
the
road
and
passed
out
of
sight
on
its
way
to
the
front
of
the
house
jane
rose
and
stood
waiting
suddenly
she
remembered
two
sentences
of
her
conversation
with
deryck
she
had
said
shall
i
ever
have
the
courage
to
carry
it
through
and
deryck
had
answered
earnestly
if
you
value
your
own
eventual
happiness
and
his
you
will
a
tap
came
at
her
door
jane
walked
across
the
room
and
opened
it
simpson
stood
on
the
threshold
mackenzie
is
in
the
library
nurse
he
said
and
wishes
to
see
you
there
then
will
you
kindly
take
me
to

to

jane
first
impression
was
of
a
short

in
a

had

a

for
him
a
napoleonic
attitude
little
spindle
legs
planted
far
apart
arms
folded
on
chest
shoulders
hunched
up
which
led
one
to
expect
as
the
eye
travelled
upwards
an
complexion
a
roman
nose
masterful
jaw
and
thin
lips
folded
in
a
line
of
conscious
power
instead
of
which
one
found
a
red
freckled
face
a
nose
which
turned
cheerfully
skyward
a
fat
pink
chin
and
drooping
sandy
moustache
the
only
striking
feature
of
the
face
was
a
pair
of
keen
blue
eyes
which
when
turned
upon
any
one
intently
almost
disappeared
beneath
bushy
red
eyebrows
and
became
little
points
of
turquoise
light
jane
had
not
been
in
his
presence
two
minutes
before
she
perceived
that
when
his
mind
was
working
he
was
entirely
unconscious
of
his
body
which
was
apt
to
do
most
peculiar
things
automatically
so
that
his
friends
had
passed
round
the
remark
robbie
chews
up
dozens
of
good
while
mackenzie
is
thinking
out
excellent
prescriptions
when
jane
entered
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
an
open
letter
which
she
instinctively
knew
to
be
deryck
and
he
did
not
look
up
at
once
when
he
did
look
up
she
saw
his
unmistakable
start
of
surprise
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
jane
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
a
tame
goldfish
at
overdene
which
used
to
rise
to
the
surface
when
the
duchess
dropped
crumbs
he
closed
it
without
uttering
a
word
and
turned
again
to
deryck
letter
and
jane
felt
herself
to
be
the
crumb
or
rather
the
camel
which
he
was
finding
it
difficult
to
swallow
she
waited
in
respectful
silence
and
deryck
words
passed
with
calming
effect
through
the
palpitating
suspense
of
her
brain
the
gaelic
mind
works
slowly
though
it
works
exceeding
sure
he
will
be
exceeding
sure
that
i
am
a
verra
poor
judge
o
women
at
last
the
little
man
on
the
lifted
his
eyes
again
to
jane
and
alas
how
high
he
had
to
lift
them
nurse
er
he
said
inquiringly
and
jane
thought
his
searching
eyes
looked
like
little
bits
of
broken
blue
china
in
a
rosemary
gray
replied
jane
meekly
with
a
curtsey
in
her
voice
feeling
as
if
they
were
rehearsing
amateur
theatricals
at
overdene
and
the
next
minute
the
duchess
cane
would
rap
the
floor
and
they
would
be
told
to
speak
up
and
not
be
so
slow
ah
said
robert
mackenzie
i
see
he
stared
hard
at
the
carpet
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
then
walked
across
and
picked
up
a
spline
broken
from
a
bass
broom
brought
it
back
to
the
examined
it
with
minute
attention
then
put
one
end
between
his
teeth
and
began
to
chew
it
jane
wondered
what
was
the
correct
thing
to
do
at
this
sort
of
interview
when
a
doctor
neither
sat
down
himself
nor
suggested
that
the
nurse
should
do
so
she
wished
she
had
asked
deryck
but
he
could
not
possibly
have
enlightened
her
because
the
first
thing
he
always
said
to
a
nurse
was
my
dear
nurse
pray
sit
down
people
who
have
much
unavoidable
standing
to
do
should
cultivate
the
habit
of
seating
themselves
comfortably
at
every
possible
opportunity
but
the
stout
little
person
on
the
was
not
deryck
so
jane
stood
at
attention
and
watched
the
stiff
bit
of
bass
wag
up
and
down
and
shorten
inch
by
inch
when
it
had
finally
disappeared
robert
mackenzie
spoke
again
so
you
have
arrived
nurse
gray
he
said
truly
the
mind
of
a
scotchman
works
slowly
thought
jane
but
she
was
thankful
to
detect
the
complete
acceptance
of
herself
in
his
tone
deryck
was
right
and
oh
the
relief
of
not
having
to
take
this
unspeakable
little
man
into
her
confidence
in
this
matter
of
the
deception
to
be
practised
on
garth
yes
sir
i
have
arrived
she
said
another
period
of
silence
a
fragment
of
the
bass
broom
reappeared
and
vanished
once
more
before
mackenzie
spoke
again
i
am
glad
you
have
arrived
nurse
gray
he
said
i
am
glad
to
have
arrived
sir
said
jane
gravely
almost
expecting
to
hear
the
duchess
delighted
ha
ha
from
the
wings
the
little
comedy
was
progressing
then
suddenly
she
became
aware
that
during
the
last
few
minutes
mackenzie
mind
had
been
concentrated
upon
something
else
she
had
not
filled
it
at
all
the
next
moment
it
was
turned
upon
her
and
two
swift
turquoise
gleams
from
under
the
shaggy
brows
swept
over
her
with
the
rapidity
and
brightness
of
mackenzie
commenced
speaking
quickly
with
a
wonderful
rolling
of
r
i
understand
miss
gray
you
have
come
to
minister
to
the
mind
rather
than
to
his
body
you
need
not
trouble
to
explain
i
have
it
from
sir
deryck
brand
who
prescribed
a
for
the
patient
and
engaged
you
i
fully
agreed
with
his
prescription
and
allow
me
to
say
i
admire
its
ingredients
jane
bowed
and
realised
how
the
duchess
would
be
chuckling
what
an
insufferable
little
person
jane
had
time
to
think
this
while
he
walked
across
to
the
bent
over
it
and
examined
an
ancient
spot
of
ink
finding
a
drop
of
candle
grease
near
it
he
removed
it
with
his
thumb
nail
brought
it
carefully
to
the
fire
and
laid
it
on
the
coals
he
watched
it
melt
fizzle
and
flare
with
an
intense
concentration
of
interest
then
jumped
round
on
jane
and
caught
her
look
of
fury
and
i
think
there
remains
very
little
for
me
to
say
to
you
about
the
treatment
miss
gray
he
finished
calmly
you
will
have
received
minute
instructions
from
sir
deryck
himself
the
great
thing
now
is
to
help
the
patient
to
take
an
interest
in
the
outer
world
the
temptation
to
persons
who
suddenly
become
totally
blind
is
to
form
a
habit
of
living
entirely
in
a
world
within
a
world
of
recollection
retrospection
and
imagination
the
only
world
in
fact
in
which
they
can
see
jane
made
a
quick
movement
of
appreciation
and
interest
after
all
she
might
learn
something
useful
from
this
eccentric
little
scotchman
oh
to
keep
his
attention
off
rubbish
on
the
carpet
and
grease
spots
on
the
yes
she
said
do
tell
me
more
this
continued
mackenzie
is
our
present
difficulty
with
dalmain
there
seems
to
be
no
possibility
of
arousing
his
interest
in
the
outside
world
he
refuses
to
receive
visitors
he
declines
to
hear
his
letters
hours
pass
without
a
word
being
spoken
by
him
unless
you
hear
him
speak
to
me
or
to
his
valet
you
will
easily
suppose
yourself
to
have
a
patient
who
has
lost
the
power
of
speech
as
well
as
the
gift
of
sight
should
he
express
a
wish
to
speak
to
me
alone
when
we
are
with
him
do
not
leave
the
room
walk
over
to
the
fireplace
and
remain
there
i
desire
that
you
should
hear
that
when
he
chooses
to
rouse
and
make
an
effort
he
is
perfectly
well
able
to
do
so
the
most
important
part
of
your
duties
nurse
gray
will
be
the
aiding
him
day
by
day
to
resume
life
the
life
of
a
blind
man
it
is
true
but
not
therefore
necessarily
an
inactive
life
now
that
all
danger
of
inflammation
from
the
wounds
has
subsided
he
may
get
up
move
about
learn
to
find
his
way
by
sound
and
touch
he
was
an
artist
by
profession
he
will
never
paint
again
but
there
are
other
gifts
which
may
form
reasonable
outlets
to
an
artistic
nature
he
paused
suddenly
having
apparently
caught
sight
of
another
grease
spot
and
walked
over
to
the
table
but
the
next
instant
jumped
round
on
jane
quick
as
lightning
with
a
question
does
he
play
said
dr
rob
but
jane
was
on
her
guard
even
against
accidental
surprises
sir
deryck
did
not
happen
to
mention
to
me
mackenzie
whether
dalmain
is
musical
or
not
ah
well
said
the
little
doctor
resuming
his
napoleonic
attitude
in
the
centre
of
the
you
must
make
it
your
business
to
find
out
and
by
the
way
nurse
do
you
play
yourself
a
little
said
jane
ah
said
dr
rob
and
i
dare
say
you
sing
a
little
too
jane
acquiesced
in
that
case
my
dear
lady
i
leave
most
explicit
orders
that
you
neither
sing
a
little
nor
play
a
little
to
dalmain
we
who
have
our
sight
can
just
endure
while
people
who
a
little
show
us
how
little
they
can
play
because
we
are
able
to
look
round
about
us
and
think
of
other
things
but
to
a
blind
man
with
an
artist
sensitive
soul
the
experience
might
culminate
in
madness
we
must
not
risk
it
i
regret
to
appear
uncomplimentary
but
a
patient
welfare
must
take
precedence
of
all
other
considerations
jane
smiled
she
was
beginning
to
like
dr
rob
i
will
be
most
careful
she
said
neither
to
play
nor
to
sing
to
mr
dalmain
good
said
mackenzie
but
now
let
me
tell
you
what
you
most
certainly
may
do
lead
him
to
the
piano
place
him
there
upon
a
seat
where
he
will
feel
secure
none
of
your
twirly
rickety
stools
make
a
little
notch
on
the
by
which
he
can
easily
find
middle
then
let
him
relieve
his
soul
by
the
painting
of
you
will
find
this
will
soon
keep
him
happy
for
hours
and
if
he
is
already
something
of
a
musician
as
that
huge
grand
piano
with
no
on
it
indicates
he
may
begin
that
sort
of
thing
at
once
before
he
is
ready
to
be
worried
with
the
braille
system
or
any
other
method
of
instructing
the
blind
but
contrive
an
easy
way
a
little
notch
in
the
below
the
note
by
means
of
which
without
hesitation
or
irritation
he
can
locate
himself
instantly
at
middle
never
mind
the
other
notes
it
is
all
the
seeing
he
will
require
when
once
he
is
at
the
piano
ha
ha
not
bad
for
a
scotchman
eh
nurse
gray
but
jane
could
not
laugh
though
somewhere
in
her
mental
background
she
seemed
to
hear
laughter
and
applause
from
the
duchess
this
was
no
comedy
to
jane
her
blind
garth
at
the
piano
his
dear
beautiful
head
bent
over
the
keys
his
fingers
feeling
for
that
pathetic
little
notch
to
be
made
by
herself
below
middle
she
loathed
this
individual
who
could
make
a
pun
on
the
subject
of
garth
blindness
and
in
the
back
of
her
mind
tommy
seemed
to
join
the
duchess
flapping
up
and
down
on
his
perch
and
shrieking
kick
him
out
stop
his
jaw
and
now
said
mackenzie
unexpectedly
the
next
thing
to
be
done
nurse
gray
is
to
introduce
you
to
the
patient
jane
felt
the
blood
slowly
leave
her
face
and
concentrate
in
a
terrible
pounding
at
her
heart
but
she
stood
her
ground
and
waited
silently
mackenzie
rang
the
bell
simpson
appeared
a
decanter
of
sherry
a
and
a
couple
of
biscuits
said
dr
rob
simpson
vanished
little
beast
thought
jane
at
eleven
in
the
morning
dr
rob
stood
and
waited
tugging
spitefully
at
his
red
moustache
and
looking
intently
out
of
the
window
simpson
reappeared
placed
a
small
tray
on
the
table
and
went
quietly
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
dr
rob
poured
out
a
glass
of
sherry
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
table
and
said
now
nurse
sit
down
and
drink
that
and
take
a
biscuit
with
it
jane
protested
but
indeed
doctor
i
never
i
have
no
doubt
you
said
dr
rob
especially
at
eleven
in
the
morning
but
you
will
so
do
not
waste
any
time
in
discussion
you
have
had
a
long
night
journey
you
are
going
upstairs
to
a
very
sad
sight
indeed
a
strain
on
the
nerves
and
sensibilities
you
have
come
through
a
trying
interview
with
me
and
you
are
praising
heaven
it
is
over
but
you
will
praise
heaven
with
more
fervency
when
you
have
drunk
the
sherry
also
you
have
been
standing
during
minutes
and
a
half
i
always
stand
to
speak
myself
and
i
prefer
folk
should
stand
to
listen
i
can
never
talk
to
people
while
they
loll
around
but
you
will
walk
upstairs
all
the
more
steadily
nurse
rosemary
gray
if
you
sit
down
now
for
five
minutes
at
this
table
jane
obeyed
touched
and
humbled
so
after
all
it
was
a
kind
comprehending
heart
under
that
old
sealskin
waistcoat
and
a
shrewd
understanding
of
men
and
matters
in
spite
of
the
erratic
somewhat
objectionable
exterior
while
she
drank
the
wine
and
finished
the
biscuits
he
found
busy
occupation
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
polishing
the
window
with
his
silk
making
a
queer
humming
noise
all
the
time
like
a
bee
buzzing
up
the
pane
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
presence
but
just
as
she
put
down
the
empty
glass
he
turned
and
walking
straight
across
the
room
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
now
nurse
he
said
follow
me
upstairs
and
just
at
first
speak
as
little
as
possible
remember
every
fresh
voice
intruding
into
the
still
depths
of
that
utter
blackness
causes
an
agony
of
bewilderment
and
disquietude
to
the
patient
speak
little
and
speak
low
and
may
god
almighty
give
you
tact
and
wisdom
there
was
a
dignity
of
conscious
knowledge
and
power
in
the
small
quaint
figure
which
preceded
jane
up
the
staircase
as
she
followed
she
became
aware
that
her
spirit
leaned
on
his
and
felt
sustained
and
strengthened
the
unexpected
conclusion
of
his
sentence
in
its
wording
yet
almost
a
prayer
gave
her
fresh
courage
may
god
almighty
give
you
tact
and
wisdom
he
had
said
little
guessing
how
greatly
she
needed
them
and
now
another
voice
echoing
through
memory
arches
to
took
up
the
strain
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
and
with
firm
though
noiseless
step
jane
followed
mackenzie
into
the
roam
where
garth
was
lying
helpless
sightless
and
disfigured
chapter
xix
the
voice
in
the
darkness
just
the
dark
head
upon
the
pillow
that
was
all
jane
saw
at
first
and
she
saw
it
in
sunshine
somehow
she
had
always
pictured
a
darkened
room
forgetting
that
to
him
darkness
and
light
were
both
alike
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
keep
out
the
sunlight
with
its
healing
purifying
invigorating
powers
he
had
requested
to
have
his
bed
moved
into
a
corner
the
corner
farthest
from
door
fireplace
and
windows
with
its
left
side
against
the
wall
so
that
he
could
feel
the
blank
wall
with
his
hand
and
turning
close
to
it
know
himself
shut
away
from
all
possible
prying
of
unseen
eyes
this
was
how
he
now
lay
and
he
did
not
turn
as
they
entered
just
the
dear
dark
head
upon
the
pillow
it
was
all
jane
saw
at
first
then
his
right
arm
in
the
sleeve
of
a
blue
silk
stretched
slightly
behind
him
as
he
lay
on
his
left
side
the
thin
white
hand
limp
and
helpless
on
the
coverlet
jane
put
her
hands
behind
her
the
impulse
was
so
strong
to
fall
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
take
that
poor
hand
in
both
her
strong
ones
and
cover
it
with
kisses
ah
surely
surely
then
the
dark
head
would
turn
to
her
and
instead
of
seeking
refuge
in
the
hard
blank
wall
he
would
hide
that
sightless
face
in
the
boundless
tenderness
of
her
arms
but
deryck
warning
voice
sounded
grave
and
persistent
if
you
value
your
own
eventual
happiness
and
his
so
jane
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
mackenzie
advanced
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
laid
his
hand
upon
garth
shoulder
then
with
an
incredible
softening
of
his
rather
strident
voice
he
spoke
so
slowly
and
quietly
that
jane
could
hardly
believe
this
to
be
the
man
who
had
jerked
out
questions
comments
and
orders
to
her
during
the
last
good
morning
dalmain
simpson
tells
me
it
has
been
an
excellent
night
the
best
you
have
yet
had
now
that
is
good
no
doubt
you
were
relieved
to
be
rid
of
johnson
capable
though
he
was
and
to
be
back
in
the
hands
of
your
own
man
again
these
trained
attendants
are
never
content
with
doing
enough
they
always
want
to
do
just
a
little
more
and
that
little
more
is
a
weariness
to
the
now
i
have
brought
you
one
who
is
prepared
to
do
all
you
need
and
yet
who
i
feel
sure
will
never
annoy
you
by
attempting
more
than
you
desire
sir
deryck
brand
prescription
nurse
rosemary
gray
is
here
and
i
believe
she
is
prepared
to
be
companion
secretary
reader
anything
you
want
in
fact
a
new
pair
of
eyes
for
you
dalmain
with
a
clever
brain
behind
them
and
a
kind
sympathetic
womanly
heart
directing
and
controlling
that
brain
nurse
gray
arrived
this
morning
mr
dalmain
no
response
from
the
bed
but
garth
hand
groped
for
the
wall
touched
it
then
dropped
listlessly
back
jane
could
not
realise
that
she
was
nurse
gray
she
only
longed
that
her
poor
boy
need
not
be
bothered
with
the
woman
it
all
seemed
at
this
moment
a
thing
apart
from
herself
and
him
mackenzie
spoke
again
nurse
rosemary
gray
is
in
the
room
mr
dalmain
then
garth
instinctive
chivalry
struggled
up
through
the
blackness
he
did
not
turn
his
head
but
his
right
hand
made
a
little
courteous
sign
of
greeting
and
he
said
in
a
low
distinct
voice
how
do
you
do
i
am
sure
it
is
most
kind
of
you
to
come
so
far
i
hope
you
had
an
easy
journey
jane
lips
moved
but
no
sound
would
pass
them
dr
rob
made
answer
quickly
without
looking
at
her
miss
gray
had
a
very
good
journey
and
looks
as
fresh
this
morning
as
if
she
had
spent
the
night
in
bed
i
can
see
she
is
a
young
lady
i
hope
my
housekeeper
will
make
her
comfortable
please
give
orders
said
the
tired
voice
and
garth
turned
even
closer
to
the
wall
as
if
to
end
the
conversation
dr
rob
attacked
his
moustache
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
blue
silk
shoulder
for
a
minute
silently
then
he
turned
and
spoke
to
jane
come
over
to
the
window
nurse
gray
i
want
to
show
you
a
special
chair
we
have
obtained
for
dalmain
in
which
he
will
be
most
comfortable
as
soon
as
he
feels
inclined
to
sit
up
you
see
here
is
an
adjustable
support
for
the
head
if
necessary
and
these
various
trays
and
stands
and
movable
tables
can
be
swung
round
into
any
position
by
a
touch
i
consider
it
excellent
and
sir
deryck
approved
it
have
you
seen
one
of
this
kind
before
nurse
gray
we
had
one
at
the
hospital
but
not
quite
so
complete
as
this
said
jane
in
the
stillness
of
that
sunlit
chamber
the
voice
from
the
bed
broke
upon
them
with
startling
suddenness
and
in
it
was
the
cry
of
one
lost
in
an
abyss
of
darkness
but
appealing
to
them
with
a
frantic
demand
for
instant
enlightenment
who
is
in
the
room
cried
garth
dalmain
his
face
was
still
turned
to
the
wall
but
he
had
raised
himself
on
his
left
elbow
in
an
attitude
which
betokened
intent
listening
mackenzie
answered
no
one
is
in
the
room
dalmain
but
myself
and
nurse
gray
there
is
some
one
else
in
the
room
said
garth
violently
how
dare
you
lie
to
me
who
was
speaking
then
jane
came
quickly
to
the
side
of
the
bed
her
hands
were
trembling
but
her
voice
was
perfectly
under
control
it
was
i
who
spoke
sir
she
said
nurse
rosemary
gray
and
i
feel
sure
i
know
why
my
voice
startled
you
dr
brand
warned
me
it
might
do
so
he
said
i
must
not
be
surprised
if
you
detected
a
remarkable
similarity
between
my
voice
and
that
of
a
mutual
friend
of
yours
and
his
he
said
he
had
often
noticed
it
garth
in
his
blindness
remained
quite
still
listening
and
considering
at
length
he
asked
slowly
did
he
say
whose
voice
yes
for
i
asked
him
he
said
it
was
miss
champion
garth
head
dropped
back
upon
the
pillow
then
without
turning
he
said
in
a
tone
which
jane
knew
meant
a
smile
on
that
dear
hidden
face
you
must
forgive
me
miss
gray
for
being
so
startled
and
so
stupidly
unpardonably
agitated
but
you
know
being
blind
is
still
such
a
new
experience
and
every
fresh
voice
which
breaks
through
the
black
curtain
of
perpetual
night
means
so
infinitely
more
than
the
speaker
realises
the
resemblance
in
your
voice
to
that
of
the
lady
sir
deryck
mentioned
is
so
remarkable
that
although
i
know
her
to
be
at
this
moment
in
egypt
i
could
scarcely
believe
she
was
not
in
the
room
and
yet
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
would
be
that
she
should
have
been
in
this
room
so
i
owe
you
and
mackenzie
most
humble
apologies
for
my
agitation
and
unbelief
he
stretched
out
his
right
hand
palm
upwards
towards
jane
jane
clasped
her
shaking
hands
behind
her
now
nurse
if
you
please
broke
in
mackenzie
rasping
voice
from
the
window
i
have
a
few
more
details
to
explain
to
you
over
here
they
talked
together
for
a
while
without
interruption
until
dr
rob
remarked
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
be
going
then
garth
said
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
doctor
for
a
few
minutes
i
will
wait
for
you
downstairs
mackenzie
said
jane
and
was
moving
towards
the
door
when
an
imperious
gesture
from
dr
rob
stopped
her
and
she
turned
silently
to
the
fireplace
she
could
not
see
any
need
now
for
this
subterfuge
and
it
annoyed
her
but
the
freckled
little
napoleon
of
the
moors
was
not
a
man
to
be
lightly
disobeyed
he
walked
to
the
door
opened
and
closed
it
then
returned
to
the
bedside
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
now
dalmain
he
said
garth
sat
up
and
turned
towards
him
eagerly
then
for
the
first
time
jane
saw
his
face
doctor
he
said
tell
me
about
this
nurse
describe
her
to
me
the
tension
in
tone
and
attitude
was
extreme
his
hands
were
clasped
in
front
of
him
as
if
imploring
sight
through
the
eyes
of
another
his
thin
white
face
worn
with
suffering
looked
so
eager
and
yet
so
blank
describe
her
to
me
doctor
he
said
this
nurse
rosemary
gray
as
you
call
her
but
it
is
not
a
pet
name
of
mine
my
dear
sir
said
dr
rob
deliberately
it
is
the
young
lady
own
name
and
a
pretty
one
too
for
remembrance
is
not
that
shakespeare
describe
her
to
me
insisted
garth
for
the
third
time
mackenzie
glanced
at
jane
but
she
had
turned
her
back
to
hide
the
tears
which
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
oh
garth
oh
beautiful
garth
of
the
shining
eyes
dr
rob
drew
deryck
letter
from
his
pocket
and
studied
it
well
he
said
slowly
she
is
a
pretty
dainty
little
thing
just
the
sort
of
elegant
young
woman
you
would
like
to
have
about
you
could
you
see
her
dark
or
fair
asked
garth
the
doctor
glanced
at
what
he
could
see
of
jane
cheek
and
at
the
brown
hands
holding
on
to
the
mantelpiece
fair
said
dr
rob
without
a
moment
hesitation
jane
started
and
glanced
round
why
should
this
little
man
be
lying
on
his
own
account
hair
queried
the
strained
voice
from
the
bed
well
said
dr
rob
deliberately
it
is
mostly
tucked
away
under
a
modest
little
cap
but
were
it
not
for
that
wise
restraint
i
should
say
it
might
be
that
kind
of
fluffy
which
puts
the
finishing
touch
to
a
dainty
pretty
woman
garth
lay
back
panting
and
pressed
his
hands
over
his
sightless
face
doctor
he
said
i
know
i
have
given
you
heaps
of
trouble
and
you
must
think
me
a
fool
but
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
go
mad
in
my
blindness
send
that
girl
away
do
not
let
her
enter
my
room
again
now
dalmain
said
mackenzie
patiently
let
us
consider
this
thing
we
may
take
it
you
have
nothing
against
this
young
lady
excepting
a
chance
resemblance
in
her
voice
to
that
of
a
friend
of
yours
now
far
away
was
not
this
other
lady
a
pleasant
person
garth
laughed
suddenly
bitterly
a
laugh
like
a
hard
sob
oh
yes
he
said
she
was
quite
a
pleasant
person
for
remembrance
quoted
dr
rob
then
why
should
not
nurse
rosemary
call
up
a
pleasant
remembrance
also
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
kind
sweet
womanly
voice
which
is
something
to
be
thankful
for
nowadays
when
so
many
women
talk
fit
to
scare
the
crows
cackle
cackle
cackle
like
stones
rattling
in
a
tin
canister
but
ca
you
understand
doctor
said
garth
wearily
that
it
is
just
the
remembrance
and
the
resemblance
which
in
my
blindness
i
can
not
bear
i
have
nothing
against
her
voice
heaven
knows
but
i
tell
you
when
i
heard
it
first
i
thought
it
was
it
was
she
the
other
come
to
me
here
and
garth
voice
ceased
suddenly
the
pleasant
lady
suggested
dr
rob
i
see
well
now
dalmain
sir
deryck
said
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
would
be
if
you
came
to
wish
for
visitors
it
appears
you
have
many
friends
ready
and
anxious
to
come
any
distance
in
order
to
bring
you
help
or
cheer
why
not
let
me
send
for
this
pleasant
lady
i
make
no
doubt
she
would
come
then
when
she
herself
had
sat
beside
you
and
talked
with
you
the
nurse
voice
would
trouble
you
no
longer
garth
sat
up
again
his
face
wild
with
protest
jane
turned
on
the
and
stood
watching
it
no
doctor
he
said
oh
my
god
no
in
the
whole
world
she
is
the
last
person
i
would
have
enter
this
room
mackenzie
bent
forward
to
examine
minutely
a
microscopic
darn
in
the
sheet
and
why
he
asked
very
low
because
said
garth
that
pleasant
lady
as
you
rightly
call
her
has
a
noble
generous
heart
and
it
might
overflow
with
pity
for
my
blindness
and
pity
from
her
i
could
not
accept
it
would
be
the
last
straw
upon
my
heavy
cross
i
can
bear
the
cross
doctor
i
hope
in
time
to
carry
it
manfully
until
god
bids
me
lay
it
down
but
that
last
straw
her
pity
would
break
me
i
should
fall
in
the
dark
to
rise
no
more
i
see
said
dr
rob
gently
poor
laddie
the
pleasant
lady
must
not
come
he
waited
silently
a
few
minutes
then
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
meanwhile
he
said
i
must
rely
on
you
dalmain
to
be
agreeable
to
nurse
rosemary
gray
and
not
to
make
her
task
too
difficult
i
dare
not
send
her
back
she
is
dr
brand
choice
besides
think
of
the
cruel
blow
to
her
in
her
profession
think
of
it
man
sent
off
at
a
moment
notice
after
spending
five
minutes
in
her
patient
room
because
forsooth
her
voice
maddened
him
poor
child
what
a
statement
to
enter
on
her
report
see
her
appear
before
the
matron
with
it
you
be
generous
and
unselfish
enough
to
face
whatever
trial
there
may
be
for
you
in
this
bit
of
a
coincidence
garth
hesitated
mackenzie
he
said
at
last
will
you
swear
to
me
that
your
description
of
this
young
lady
was
accurate
in
every
detail
not
at
all
quoted
dr
rob
unctuously
i
had
a
pious
mother
laddie
besides
i
can
do
better
than
that
i
will
let
you
into
a
secret
i
was
reading
from
sir
deryck
letter
i
am
no
authority
on
women
myself
having
always
considered
dogs
and
horses
less
ensnaring
and
more
companionable
creatures
so
i
would
not
trust
my
own
eyes
but
preferred
to
give
you
sir
deryck
description
you
will
allow
him
to
be
a
fine
judge
of
women
you
have
seen
lady
brand
seen
her
yes
said
garth
eagerly
a
slight
flush
tinting
his
thin
cheeks
and
more
than
that
i
painted
her
ah
such
a
picture
standing
at
a
table
the
sunlight
in
her
hair
arranging
golden
daffodils
in
an
old
venetian
vase
did
you
see
it
doctor
in
the
new
gallery
two
years
ago
no
said
dr
rob
i
am
not
finding
myself
in
galleries
new
or
old
but
he
turned
a
swift
look
of
inquiry
on
jane
who
nodded
nurse
gray
was
telling
me
she
had
seen
it
really
said
garth
interested
somehow
one
does
not
connect
nurses
with
picture
galleries
i
do
know
why
not
said
dr
rob
they
must
go
somewhere
for
their
outings
they
ca
be
everlastingly
nosing
shop
windows
in
all
weathers
so
why
not
go
in
and
have
a
look
at
your
pictures
besides
miss
rosemary
is
a
young
lady
of
parts
sir
deryck
assures
me
she
is
a
gentlewoman
by
birth
and
now
laddie
what
is
it
to
be
garth
considered
silently
jane
turned
away
and
gripped
the
mantelpiece
so
much
hung
in
the
balance
during
that
quiet
minute
at
length
garth
spoke
slowly
hesitatingly
if
only
i
could
quite
disassociate
the
voice
from
the
from
that
other
personality
if
i
could
be
quite
sure
that
though
her
voice
is
so
extraordinarily
like
she
herself
is
not
he
paused
and
jane
heart
stood
still
was
a
description
of
herself
coming
is
not
at
all
like
the
face
and
figure
which
stand
clear
in
my
remembrance
as
associated
with
that
voice
well
said
dr
rob
i
thinking
we
can
manage
that
for
you
these
nurses
know
their
patients
must
be
humoured
we
will
call
the
young
lady
back
and
she
shall
kneel
down
beside
your
bed
bless
you
she
wo
mind
with
me
to
play
old
gooseberry
and
you
shall
pass
your
hands
over
her
face
and
hair
and
round
her
little
waist
and
assure
yourself
by
touch
what
an
elegant
dainty
little
person
it
is
in
a
blue
frock
and
white
apron
garth
burst
out
laughing
and
his
voice
had
a
tone
it
had
not
yet
held
of
all
the
preposterous
suggestions
he
said
good
heavens
what
an
ass
i
must
have
been
making
of
myself
and
i
begin
to
think
i
have
exaggerated
the
resemblance
in
a
day
or
two
i
shall
cease
to
notice
it
and
look
here
doctor
if
she
really
was
interested
in
that
portrait
here
i
say
where
are
you
going
all
right
sir
said
dr
rob
i
was
merely
moving
a
chair
over
to
the
fireside
and
taking
the
liberty
of
pouring
out
a
glass
of
water
really
you
are
becoming
abnormally
quick
of
hearing
now
i
am
all
attention
what
about
the
portrait
i
was
only
going
to
say
if
she
the
nurse
you
know
is
really
interested
in
my
portrait
of
lady
brand
there
are
studies
of
it
up
in
the
studio
which
she
might
care
to
see
if
she
brought
them
here
and
described
them
to
me
i
could
explain
but
i
say
doctor
i
ca
have
dainty
young
ladies
in
and
out
of
my
room
while
i
in
bed
why
should
i
get
up
and
try
that
chair
of
yours
send
simpson
along
and
tell
him
to
look
out
my
brown
and
orange
tie
good
heavens
what
a
blessing
to
have
the
memory
of
colours
and
of
how
they
blend
think
of
the
fellows
who
are
born
blind
and
please
ask
miss
gray
to
go
out
in
the
pine
wood
or
on
the
moor
or
use
the
motor
or
rest
or
do
anything
she
likes
tell
her
to
make
herself
quite
at
home
but
on
no
account
to
come
up
here
until
simpson
reports
me
ready
you
may
rely
on
nurse
gray
to
be
most
discreet
said
dr
rob
whose
voice
had
suddenly
become
very
husky
and
as
for
getting
up
laddie
do
go
too
fast
you
will
not
find
your
strength
equal
to
much
but
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
there
is
nothing
to
keep
you
in
bed
if
you
feel
like
rising
doctor
said
garth
groping
for
his
hand
and
i
am
sorry
i
shall
never
be
able
to
offer
to
paint
mrs
mackenzie
you
have
to
paint
her
with
a
shaggy
head
four
paws
and
the
softest
amber
eyes
in
the
world
said
dr
rob
tenderly
and
looking
out
from
those
eyes
the
most
faithful
loving
in
creation
in
all
the
years
we
kept
house
together
she
has
never
failed
to
meet
me
with
a
welcome
never
contradicted
me
or
wanted
the
last
word
and
never
worried
me
for
so
much
as
the
price
of
a
bonnet
there
a
woman
for
you
well
lad
and
god
almighty
bless
you
and
be
careful
how
you
go
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
look
in
again
on
my
way
back
from
my
rounds
to
see
how
you
like
that
chair
mackenzie
held
open
the
door
jane
passed
noiselessly
out
before
him
he
followed
signing
to
her
to
precede
him
down
the
stairs
in
the
library
jane
turned
and
faced
him
he
put
her
quietly
into
a
chair
and
stood
before
her
the
bright
blue
eyes
were
moist
beneath
the
shaggy
brows
my
dear
he
said
i
feel
myself
somewhat
of
a
blundering
old
fool
you
must
forgive
me
i
never
contemplated
putting
you
through
such
an
ordeal
i
perfectly
understand
that
while
he
hesitated
you
must
have
felt
your
whole
career
at
stake
i
see
you
have
been
weeping
but
you
must
not
take
it
too
much
to
heart
that
our
patient
made
so
much
of
your
voice
resembling
this
miss
champion
he
will
forget
all
about
it
in
a
day
or
two
and
you
will
be
worth
more
to
him
than
a
dozen
miss
champions
see
what
good
you
have
done
him
already
here
he
is
wanting
to
get
up
and
explain
his
pictures
to
you
never
you
fear
you
will
soon
win
your
way
and
i
shall
be
able
to
report
to
sir
deryck
what
a
fine
success
you
have
made
of
the
case
now
i
must
see
the
valet
and
give
him
very
full
instructions
and
i
recommend
you
to
go
for
a
blow
on
the
moor
and
get
an
appetite
for
lunch
only
put
on
something
warmer
than
that
you
will
have
no
work
to
do
and
having
duly
impressed
me
with
your
washableness
and
serviceableness
you
may
as
well
wear
something
comfortable
to
protect
you
from
our
highland
nip
have
you
warmer
clothing
with
you
it
is
the
rule
of
our
guild
to
wear
uniform
said
jane
but
i
have
a
grey
merino
ah
i
see
well
wear
the
grey
merino
i
shall
return
in
two
hours
to
observe
how
he
stands
that
move
now
do
let
me
keep
you
mackenzie
said
jane
quietly
may
i
ask
why
you
described
me
as
fair
and
my
very
straight
heavy
plainly
coiled
hair
as
fluffy
dr
rob
had
already
reached
the
bell
but
at
her
question
he
stayed
his
hand
and
turning
met
jane
steadfast
eyes
with
the
shrewd
turquoise
gleam
of
his
own
why
certainly
you
may
ask
nurse
rosemary
gray
he
said
though
i
wonder
you
think
it
necessary
to
do
so
it
was
of
course
perfectly
evident
to
me
that
for
reasons
of
his
own
sir
deryck
wished
to
paint
an
imaginary
portrait
of
you
to
the
patient
most
likely
representing
some
known
ideal
of
his
as
the
description
was
so
different
from
the
reality
i
concluded
that
to
make
the
portrait
complete
the
two
touches
unfortunately
left
to
me
to
supply
had
better
be
as
unlike
what
i
saw
before
me
as
the
rest
of
the
picture
and
now
if
you
will
be
good
enough
dr
rob
rang
the
bell
violently
and
why
did
you
take
the
risk
of
suggesting
that
he
should
feel
me
persisted
jane
because
i
knew
he
was
a
gentleman
shouted
dr
rob
angrily
oh
come
in
simpson
come
in
my
good
fellow
and
shut
that
door
and
god
almighty
be
praised
that
he
made
you
and
me
men
and
not
women
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
jane
watched
him
drive
away
thinking
to
herself
deryck
was
right
but
what
a
queer
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
obtuseness
and
how
marvellously
it
worked
out
to
the
furtherance
of
our
plans
but
as
she
watched
the
start
off
at
a
smart
trot
across
the
moor
she
would
have
been
more
than
a
little
surprised
could
she
have
overheard
dr
rob
muttered
remarks
to
himself
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
and
cheered
on
his
sturdy
cob
he
had
a
habit
of
talking
over
his
experiences
half
aloud
as
he
drove
from
case
to
case
the
two
sides
of
his
rather
complex
nature
apparently
comparing
notes
with
each
other
and
the
present
conversation
opened
thus
now
what
has
brought
the
honourable
jane
up
here
said
dr
rob
dashed
if
i
know
said
mackenzie
you
must
not
swear
laddie
said
dr
rob
you
had
a
pious
mother
chapter
xx
jane
reports
progress
letter
from
the
honourable
jane
champion
to
sir
deryck
brand
castle
gleneesh
b
my
dear
deryck
my
wires
and
have
not
told
you
much
beyond
the
fact
of
my
safe
arrival
having
been
here
a
fortnight
i
think
it
is
time
i
sent
you
a
report
only
you
must
remember
that
i
am
a
poor
scribe
from
infancy
it
has
always
been
difficult
to
me
to
write
anything
beyond
that
stock
commencement
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
and
i
approach
the
task
of
a
descriptive
letter
with
an
effort
which
is
colossal
and
yet
i
wish
i
might
for
once
borrow
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer
because
i
can
not
help
knowing
that
i
have
been
passing
through
experiences
such
as
do
not
often
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
woman
nurse
rosemary
gray
is
getting
on
capitally
she
is
making
herself
indispensable
to
the
patient
and
he
turns
to
her
with
a
completeness
of
confidence
which
causes
her
heart
to
swell
with
professional
pride
poor
jane
has
got
no
further
than
hearing
from
his
own
lips
that
she
is
the
very
last
person
in
the
whole
world
he
would
wish
should
come
near
him
in
his
blindness
when
she
was
suggested
as
a
possible
visitor
he
said
oh
my
god
no
and
his
face
was
one
wild
horrified
protest
so
jane
is
getting
her
horsewhipping
boy
and
according
to
the
method
of
a
careful
and
thoughtful
judge
who
orders
thirty
lashes
of
the
cat
in
three
applications
of
ten
so
is
jane
punishment
laid
on
at
intervals
not
more
than
she
can
bear
at
a
time
but
enough
to
keep
her
heart
continually
sore
and
her
spirit
in
perpetual
dread
and
you
dear
clever
doctor
are
proved
perfectly
right
in
your
diagnosis
of
the
sentiment
of
the
case
he
says
her
pity
would
be
the
last
straw
on
his
already
heavy
cross
and
the
expression
is
an
apt
one
her
pity
for
him
being
indeed
a
thing
of
straw
the
only
pity
she
feels
is
pity
for
herself
thus
hopelessly
caught
in
the
meshes
of
her
own
mistake
but
how
to
make
him
realise
this
is
the
puzzle
do
you
remember
how
the
israelites
were
shut
in
between
migdol
and
the
sea
i
knew
migdol
meant
towers
but
i
never
understood
the
passage
until
i
stood
upon
that
narrow
wedge
of
desert
with
the
red
sea
in
front
and
on
the
left
the
rocky
range
of
gebel
attaka
on
the
right
towering
up
against
the
sky
like
the
weird
shapes
of
an
impregnable
fortress
the
sole
outlet
or
inlet
behind
being
the
route
they
had
just
travelled
from
egypt
and
along
which
the
chariots
and
horsemen
of
pharaoh
were
then
thundering
in
hot
pursuit
even
so
boy
is
poor
jane
now
tramping
her
patch
of
desert
which
narrows
daily
to
the
measure
of
her
despair
migdol
is
his
certainty
that
her
love
could
only
be
pity
the
red
sea
is
the
confession
into
which
she
must
inevitably
plunge
to
avoid
scaling
migdol
in
the
chill
waters
of
which
as
she
drags
him
in
with
her
his
love
is
bound
to
drown
as
waves
of
doubt
and
mistrust
sweep
over
its
head
doubts
which
he
has
lost
the
power
of
removing
mistrust
which
he
can
never
hope
to
prove
to
have
been
false
and
mistaken
and
behind
come
galloping
the
hosts
of
pharaoh
chance
speeding
on
the
wheels
of
circumstance
at
any
moment
some
accident
may
compel
a
revelation
and
instantly
he
will
be
scaling
rocky
migdol
with
torn
hands
and
bleeding
feet
and
she
poor
jane
floundering
in
the
depths
of
the
red
sea
o
for
a
moses
with
divine
commission
to
stretch
out
the
rod
of
understanding
love
making
a
safe
way
through
so
that
together
they
might
reach
the
promised
land
dear
wise
old
boy
dare
you
undertake
the
role
of
moses
but
here
am
i
writing
like
a
page
of
baedeker
and
failing
to
report
on
actual
facts
as
you
may
suppose
jane
grows
haggard
and
thin
in
spite
of
old
margery
porridge
which
is
put
on
every
day
after
lunch
for
the
next
morning
breakfast
and
anybody
passing
gives
it
a
stir
did
you
know
that
was
the
right
way
to
make
porridge
deryck
i
always
thought
it
was
made
in
five
minutes
as
wanted
margery
says
that
must
be
the
english
stuff
which
profanely
goes
by
the
name
please
mark
the
with
which
i
repeat
scotch
remarks
without
rushing
into
weird
spelling
a
senseless
performance
it
seems
to
me
for
if
you
know
already
how
old
margery
pronounces
porridge
you
can
read
her
pronunciation
into
the
sentence
and
if
you
do
not
know
it
no
grotesque
spelling
on
my
part
could
convey
to
your
mind
any
but
a
caricatured
version
of
the
pretty
scotch
accent
with
which
margery
says
stir
the
porridge
nurse
gray
in
fact
i
am
agreeably
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
i
understand
the
natives
and
the
pleasure
i
derive
from
their
conversation
for
after
wrestling
with
one
or
two
modern
novels
dealing
with
the
highlands
i
had
expected
to
find
the
language
an
unknown
tongue
instead
of
which
lo
and
behold
old
margery
maggie
the
housemaid
macdonald
the
gardener
and
macalister
the
all
speak
a
rather
purer
english
than
i
do
far
more
carefully
pronounced
and
with
every
r
sounded
and
rolled
their
idioms
are
more
characteristic
than
their
accent
they
say
whenever
for
when
and
use
in
their
verbs
several
quaint
variations
of
tense
but
what
a
syntactical
digression
oh
boy
the
wound
at
my
heart
is
so
deep
and
so
sore
that
i
dread
the
dressings
even
by
your
delicate
touch
where
was
i
ah
the
porridge
gave
me
my
loophole
of
escape
well
as
i
was
saying
jane
grows
worn
and
thin
old
margery
porridge
notwithstanding
but
nurse
rosemary
gray
is
flourishing
and
remains
a
pretty
dainty
little
thing
with
the
additional
charm
of
fluffy
for
hair
dr
rob
own
unaided
contribution
to
the
fascinating
picture
by
the
way
i
was
quite
unprepared
to
find
him
such
a
character
i
learn
much
from
mackenzie
and
i
love
dr
rob
excepting
on
those
occasions
when
i
long
to
pick
him
up
by
the
scruff
of
his
fawn
overcoat
and
drop
him
out
of
the
window
on
the
point
of
nurse
rosemary
personal
appearance
i
found
it
best
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
the
household
you
can
have
no
conception
how
often
awkward
moments
arose
as
for
instance
in
the
library
the
first
time
garth
came
downstairs
when
he
ordered
simpson
to
bring
the
steps
for
miss
gray
and
simpson
opened
his
lips
to
remark
that
nurse
gray
could
reach
to
the
top
shelf
on
her
own
tiptoes
with
the
greatest
ease
he
having
just
seen
her
do
it
mercifully
the
perfect
training
of
an
english
saved
the
situation
and
he
merely
said
yessir
certainly
sir
and
looked
upon
me
standing
silently
by
as
a
person
who
evidently
delighted
in
giving
unnecessary
trouble
had
it
been
dear
old
margery
with
her
scotch
tongue
which
starts
slowly
but
gathers
momentum
as
it
rolls
and
can
never
be
arrested
until
the
full
flood
of
her
thought
has
been
poured
forth
i
should
have
been
constrained
to
pick
her
up
bodily
in
my
dainty
arms
and
carry
her
out
so
i
sent
for
simpson
and
margery
to
the
that
evening
when
the
master
was
safely
out
of
and
told
them
that
for
reasons
which
i
could
not
fully
explain
a
very
incorrect
description
of
my
appearance
had
been
given
him
he
thought
me
small
and
slim
fair
and
very
pretty
and
it
was
most
important
in
order
to
avoid
long
explanations
and
mental
confusion
for
him
that
he
should
not
at
present
be
undeceived
simpson
expression
of
polite
attention
did
not
vary
and
his
only
comment
was
certainly
miss
quite
so
but
across
old
margery
countenance
while
i
was
speaking
passed
many
shades
of
opinion
which
fortunately
by
the
time
i
had
finished
crystallized
into
an
approving
smile
of
acquiescence
she
even
added
her
own
commentary
and
a
very
good
thing
too
i
am
thinking
for
master
garth
poor
laddie
was
always
so
set
upon
having
beauty
about
him
garthie
i
would
say
to
him
when
he
had
friends
coming
and
all
his
ideas
in
talking
over
the
dinner
concerned
the
cleaning
up
of
the
old
silver
and
putting
out
of
valentine
glass
and
worstered
china
garthie
i
would
say
feeling
the
occasion
called
for
the
apt
quoting
of
scripture
appears
to
me
your
attention
is
given
entirely
to
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
and
you
care
nothing
for
all
the
good
things
that
lie
within
so
it
is
just
as
well
to
keep
him
deceived
miss
gray
and
then
as
simpson
coughed
tactfully
behind
his
hand
and
nudged
her
very
obviously
with
his
elbow
she
added
as
a
sympathetic
for
though
a
homey
face
may
indeed
be
redeemed
by
its
kindly
expression
you
can
not
very
well
explain
expression
to
the
blind
so
you
see
deryck
this
shrewd
old
body
who
has
known
garth
from
boyhood
would
have
entirely
agreed
with
the
decision
of
three
years
ago
well
to
continue
my
report
the
voice
gave
us
some
trouble
as
you
foresaw
and
the
whole
plan
hung
in
the
balance
during
a
few
awful
moments
for
though
he
easily
accepted
the
explanation
we
had
planned
he
sent
me
out
and
told
mackenzie
my
voice
in
his
room
would
madden
him
dr
rob
was
equal
to
the
occasion
and
won
the
day
and
garth
having
once
given
in
never
mentioned
the
matter
again
only
sometimes
i
see
him
listening
and
remembering
but
nurse
rosemary
gray
has
beautiful
hours
when
poor
anxious
yearning
jane
is
shut
out
for
her
patient
turns
to
her
and
depends
on
her
and
talks
to
her
and
tries
to
reach
her
mind
and
shows
her
his
and
is
a
wonderful
person
to
live
with
and
know
jane
marching
about
in
the
cold
outside
and
hearing
them
talk
realises
how
little
she
understood
the
beautiful
gift
which
was
laid
at
her
feet
how
little
she
had
grasped
the
nature
and
mind
of
the
man
whom
she
dismissed
as
a
mere
boy
nurse
rosemary
sitting
beside
him
during
long
sweet
hours
of
companionship
is
learning
it
and
jane
ramping
up
and
down
her
narrowing
strip
of
desert
tastes
the
sirocco
of
despair
and
now
i
come
to
the
point
of
my
letter
and
though
i
am
a
woman
i
will
not
put
it
in
a
postscript
deryck
can
you
come
up
soon
to
pay
him
a
visit
and
to
talk
to
me
i
do
think
i
can
bear
it
unaided
much
longer
and
he
would
so
enjoy
having
you
and
showing
you
how
he
had
got
on
and
all
the
things
he
had
already
learned
to
do
also
you
might
put
in
a
word
for
jane
or
at
all
events
get
at
his
mind
on
the
subject
oh
boy
if
you
could
spare
hours
and
a
breath
of
the
moors
would
be
good
for
you
also
i
have
a
little
private
plan
which
depends
largely
for
its
fulfilment
on
your
coming
oh
boy
come
yours
needing
you
jeanette
from
sir
deryck
brand
to
nurse
rosemary
gray
castle
gleneesh
wimpole
street
my
dear
jeanette
certainly
i
will
come
i
will
leave
euston
on
friday
evening
i
can
spend
the
whole
of
saturday
and
most
of
sunday
at
gleneesh
but
must
be
home
in
time
for
monday
work
i
will
do
my
best
only
alas
i
am
not
moses
and
do
not
possess
his
rod
moreover
latest
investigations
have
proved
that
the
israelites
could
not
have
crossed
at
the
place
you
mention
but
further
north
at
the
bitter
lakes
a
mere
matter
of
detail
in
no
way
affecting
the
extreme
appositeness
of
your
illustration
rather
adding
to
it
for
i
fear
there
are
bitter
waters
ahead
of
you
my
poor
girl
still
i
am
hopeful
nay
more
than
hopeful
confident
often
of
late
in
connection
with
you
i
have
thought
of
the
promise
about
all
things
working
together
for
good
any
one
can
make
good
things
work
together
for
good
but
only
the
heavenly
father
can
bring
good
out
of
evil
and
taking
all
our
mistakes
and
failings
and
foolishnesses
cause
them
to
work
to
our
most
perfect
the
more
intricate
and
involved
this
problem
of
human
existence
becomes
the
greater
the
need
to
take
as
our
own
clear
rule
of
life
trust
in
the
lord
with
all
thine
heart
and
lean
not
unto
thine
own
understanding
in
all
thy
ways
acknowledge
him
and
he
shall
direct
thy
paths
ancient
marching
orders
and
simple
but
true
and
therefore
eternal
i
am
glad
nurse
rosemary
is
proving
so
efficient
but
i
hope
we
may
not
have
to
face
yet
another
complication
in
our
problem
suppose
our
patient
falls
in
love
with
dainty
little
nurse
rosemary
where
will
jane
be
then
i
fear
the
desert
would
have
to
open
its
mouth
and
swallow
her
up
we
must
avert
such
a
catastrophe
could
not
rosemary
be
induced
to
drop
an
occasional
h
or
to
confess
herself
as
rather
gone
on
simpson
oh
my
poor
old
girl
i
could
not
jest
thus
were
i
not
coming
shortly
to
your
aid
how
maddening
it
is
and
you
so
priceless
but
most
men
are
either
fools
or
blind
and
one
is
both
trust
me
to
prove
it
to
him
to
my
own
satisfaction
and
his
if
i
get
the
chance
yours
always
devotedly
deryck
brand
from
sir
deryck
brand
to
robert
mackenzie
dear
mackenzie
do
you
consider
it
to
be
advisable
that
i
should
shortly
pay
a
visit
to
our
patient
at
gleneesh
and
give
an
opinion
on
his
progress
i
find
i
can
make
it
possible
to
come
north
this
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
the
nurse
i
sent
up
yours
very
faithfully
deryck
brand
from
robert
mackenzie
to
sir
deryck
brand
dear
sir
deryck
every
possible
need
of
the
patient
is
being
met
by
the
capable
lady
you
sent
to
be
his
nurse
i
am
no
longer
needed
nor
are
you
for
the
patient
but
i
deem
it
exceedingly
advisable
that
you
should
shortly
pay
a
visit
to
the
nurse
who
is
losing
more
flesh
than
a
lady
of
her
proportions
can
well
afford
some
secret
care
besides
the
natural
anxiety
of
having
the
responsibility
of
this
case
is
wearing
her
out
she
may
confide
in
you
she
can
not
quite
bring
herself
to
trust
in
your
humble
servant

chapter
xxi
hard
on
the
secretary
nurse
rosemary
sat
with
her
patient
in
the
sunny
library
at
gleneesh
a
small
table
was
between
them
upon
which
lay
a
pile
of
letters
his
morning
mail
ready
for
her
to
open
read
to
him
and
pass
across
should
there
chance
to
be
one
among
them
he
wished
to
touch
or
to
keep
in
his
pocket
they
were
seated
close
to
the
french
window
opening
on
to
the
terrace
the
breeze
fragrant
with
the
breath
of
spring
flowers
blew
about
them
and
the
morning
sun
streamed
in
garth
in
white
flannels
wearing
a
green
tie
and
a
of
primroses
lay
back
luxuriously
enjoying
with
his
rapidly
quickening
senses
the
scent
of
the
flowers
and
the
touch
of
the
nurse
rosemary
finished
reading
a
letter
of
her
own
folded
it
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
with
a
feeling
of
thankful
relief
deryck
was
coming
he
had
not
failed
her
a
man
letter
miss
gray
said
garth
unexpectedly
quite
right
said
nurse
rosemary
how
did
you
know
because
it
was
on
one
sheet
a
woman
letter
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
would
have
run
to
two
if
not
three
and
that
letter
was
on
a
matter
of
importance
right
again
said
nurse
rosemary
smiling
and
again
how
did
you
know
because
you
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
after
reading
the
first
line
and
another
as
you
folded
it
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
nurse
rosemary
laughed
you
are
getting
on
so
fast
dalmain
that
soon
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
no
secrets
my
letter
was
from
oh
do
tell
me
cried
garth
quickly
putting
out
his
hand
in
protest
i
had
no
idea
of
seeming
curious
as
to
your
private
correspondence
miss
gray
only
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
report
progress
to
you
in
the
things
i
manage
to
find
out
without
being
told
but
i
meant
to
tell
you
anyway
said
nurse
rosemary
the
letter
is
from
sir
deryck
and
amongst
other
things
he
says
he
is
coming
up
to
see
you
next
saturday
ah
good
said
garth
and
what
a
change
he
will
find
and
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
reporting
on
the
nurse
secretary
reader
and
unspeakably
patient
guide
and
companion
he
provided
for
me
then
he
added
in
a
tone
of
suddenly
awakened
anxiety
he
is
not
coming
to
take
you
away
is
he
no
said
nurse
rosemary
not
yet
but
dalmain
i
was
wanting
to
ask
whether
you
could
spare
me
just
during
hours
and
dr
brand
visit
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
i
could
leave
you
more
easily
knowing
you
would
have
his
companionship
if
i
may
take
the
leaving
on
friday
night
i
could
return
early
on
monday
morning
and
be
with
you
in
time
to
do
the
morning
letters
dr
brand
would
read
you
saturday
and
sunday
ah
i
forgot
there
is
no
sunday
post
so
i
should
miss
but
one
and
he
would
more
than
take
my
place
in
other
ways
very
well
said
garth
striving
not
to
show
disappointment
i
should
have
liked
that
we
three
should
have
talked
together
but
no
wonder
you
want
a
time
off
shall
you
be
going
far
no
i
have
friends
near
by
and
now
do
you
wish
to
attend
to
your
letters
yes
said
garth
reaching
out
his
hand
wait
a
minute
there
is
a
newspaper
among
them
i
smell
the
printing
ink
i
do
want
that
but
kindly
give
me
the
rest
nurse
rosemary
took
out
the
newspaper
then
pushed
the
pile
along
until
it
touched
his
hand
garth
took
them
what
a
lot
he
said
smiling
in
pleasurable
anticipation
i
say
miss
gray
if
you
profit
as
you
ought
to
do
by
the
reading
of
so
many
epistles
written
in
every
possible
and
impossible
style
you
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
out
a
pretty
comprehensive
do
you
remember
the
condolences
of
i
think
that
was
the
first
time
we
really
laughed
together
kind
old
soul
but
she
should
not
have
mentioned
blind
bartimaeus
dipping
seven
times
in
the
pool
of
siloam
it
is
always
best
to
avoid
classical
allusions
especially
if
sacred
unless
one
has
them
accurately
now
garth
paused
he
had
been
handling
his
letters
one
by
one
carefully
fingering
each
before
laying
it
on
the
table
beside
him
he
had
just
come
to
one
written
on
foreign
paper
and
sealed
he
broke
off
his
sentence
abruptly
held
the
letter
silently
for
a
moment
then
passed
his
fingers
slowly
over
the
seal
nurse
rosemary
watched
him
anxiously
he
made
no
remark
but
after
a
moment
laid
it
down
and
took
up
the
next
but
when
he
passed
the
pile
across
to
her
he
slipped
the
sealed
letter
beneath
the
rest
so
that
she
should
come
to
it
last
of
all
then
the
usual
order
of
proceedings
commenced
garth
lighted
a
cigarette
one
of
the
first
things
he
had
learned
to
do
for
himself
and
smoked
contentedly
carefully
placing
his
and
almost
unfailingly
locating
the
ash
in
time
and
correctly
nurse
rosemary
took
up
the
first
letter
read
the
postmark
and
described
the
writing
on
the
envelope
garth
guessed
from
whom
it
came
and
was
immensely
pleased
if
on
opening
his
surmise
proved
correct
there
were
nine
of
varying
interest
some
from
men
friends
one
or
two
from
charming
women
who
professed
themselves
ready
to
come
and
see
him
as
soon
as
he
wished
for
visitors
one
from
a
blind
asylum
asking
for
a
subscription
a
short
note
from
the
doctor
heralding
his
visit
and
a
bill
for
ties
from
a
bond
street
shop
nurse
rosemary
fingers
shook
as
she
replaced
the
eighth
in
its
envelope
the
last
of
the
pile
lay
on
the
table
as
she
took
it
up
garth
with
a
quick
movement
flung
his
through
the
window
and
lay
back
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
did
i
shoot
straight
nurse
he
asked
she
leaned
forward
and
saw
the
tiny
column
of
blue
smoke
rising
from
the
gravel
quite
straight
she
said
dalmain
this
letter
has
an
egyptian
stamp
and
the
postmark
is
cairo
it
is
sealed
with
scarlet
and
the
engraving
on
the
seal
is
a
plumed
helmet
with
the
visor
closed
and
the
writing
asked
garth
mechanically
and
very
quietly
the
handwriting
is
rather
bold
and
very
clear
with
no
twirls
or
flourishes
it
is
written
with
a
broad
nib
will
you
kindly
open
it
nurse
and
tell
me
the
signature
before
reading
the
rest
of
the
letter
nurse
rosemary
fought
with
her
throat
which
threatened
to
close
altogether
and
stifle
her
voice
she
opened
the
letter
turned
to
the
last
page
and
found
the
signature
it
is
signed
champion
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
read
it
please
said
garth
quietly
and
nurse
rosemary
began
dear
dal
what
can
i
write
if
i
were
with
you
there
would
be
so
much
i
could
say
but
writing
is
so
difficult
so
impossible
i
know
it
is
harder
for
you
than
it
would
have
been
for
any
of
us
but
you
will
be
braver
over
it
than
we
should
have
been
and
you
will
come
through
splendidly
and
go
on
thinking
life
beautiful
and
making
it
seem
so
to
other
people
never
thought
it
so
until
that
summer
at
overdene
and
shenstone
when
you
taught
me
the
perception
of
beauty
since
then
in
every
sunset
and
sunrise
in
the
of
the
atlantic
the
purple
of
the
mountains
the
spray
of
niagara
the
cherry
blossom
of
japan
the
golden
deserts
of
egypt
i
have
thought
of
you
and
understood
them
better
because
of
you
oh
dal
i
should
like
to
come
and
tell
you
all
about
them
and
let
you
see
them
through
my
eyes
and
then
you
would
widen
out
my
narrow
understanding
of
them
and
show
them
again
to
me
in
greater
loveliness
i
hear
you
receive
no
visitors
but
can
not
you
make
just
one
exception
and
let
me
come
i
was
at
the
great
pyramid
when
i
heard
i
was
sitting
on
the
piazza
after
dinner
the
moonlight
called
up
memories
i
had
just
made
up
my
mind
to
give
up
the
nile
and
to
come
straight
home
and
write
asking
you
to
come
and
see
me
when
general
loraine
turned
up
with
an
english
paper
and
a
letter
from
myra
and
i
heard
would
you
have
come
garth
and
now
my
friend
as
you
can
not
come
to
me
may
i
come
to
you
if
you
just
say
come
i
will
come
from
any
part
of
the
world
where
i
may
chance
to
be
when
the
message
reaches
me
never
mind
this
egyptian
address
i
shall
not
be
there
when
you
are
hearing
this
direct
to
me
at
my
aunt
town
house
all
my
letters
go
there
and
are
forwarded
unopened
let
me
come
and
oh
do
believe
that
i
know
something
of
how
hard
it
is
for
you
but
god
can
enable
believe
me
to
be
yours
more
than
i
can
write
jane
champion
garth
removed
the
hand
which
had
been
shielding
his
face
if
you
are
not
tired
miss
gray
after
reading
so
many
letters
i
should
like
to
dictate
my
answer
to
that
one
immediately
while
it
is
fresh
in
my
mind
have
you
paper
there
thank
you
may
we
begin
dear
miss
champion
i
am
deeply
touched
by
your
kind
letter
of
sympathy
it
was
especially
good
of
you
to
write
to
me
from
so
far
away
amid
so
much
which
might
well
have
diverted
your
attention
from
friends
at
home
a
long
pause
nurse
rosemary
gray
waited
pen
in
hand
and
hoped
the
beating
of
her
heart
was
only
in
her
own
ears
and
not
audible
across
the
small
table
i
am
glad
you
did
not
give
up
the
nile
trip
but
an
early
bee
hummed
in
from
the
hyacinths
and
buzzed
against
the
pane
otherwise
the
room
was
very
still
but
of
course
if
you
had
sent
for
me
i
should
have
come
the
bee
fought
the
window
angrily
up
and
down
up
and
down
for
several
minutes
then
found
the
open
glass
and
whirled
out
into
the
sunshine
joyfully
absolute
silence
in
the
room
until
garth
quiet
voice
broke
it
as
he
went
on
dictating
it
is
more
than
kind
of
you
to
suggest
coming
to
see
me
but
nurse
rosemary
dropped
her
pen
oh
dalmain
she
said
let
her
come
garth
turned
upon
her
a
face
of
blank
surprise
i
do
not
wish
it
he
said
in
a
tone
of
absolute
finality
but
think
how
hard
it
must
be
for
any
one
to
want
so
much
to
be
near
a
a
friend
in
trouble
and
to
be
kept
away
it
is
only
her
wonderful
kindness
of
heart
makes
her
offer
to
come
miss
gray
she
is
a
friend
and
comrade
of
long
ago
it
would
greatly
sadden
her
to
see
me
thus
it
does
not
seem
so
to
her
pleaded
nurse
rosemary
ah
can
not
you
read
between
the
lines
or
does
it
take
a
woman
heart
to
understand
a
woman
letter
did
i
read
it
badly
may
i
read
it
over
again
a
look
of
real
annoyance
gathered
upon
garth
face
he
spoke
with
quiet
sternness
a
frown
bending
his
straight
black
brows
you
read
it
quite
well
he
said
but
you
do
not
do
well
to
discuss
it
i
must
feel
able
to
dictate
my
letters
to
my
secretary
without
having
to
explain
them
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
nurse
rosemary
humbly
i
was
wrong
garth
stretched
his
hand
across
the
table
and
left
it
there
a
moment
though
no
responsive
hand
was
placed
within
it
never
mind
he
said
with
his
winning
smile
my
kind
little
mentor
and
guide
you
can
direct
me
in
most
things
but
not
in
this
now
let
us
conclude
where
were
we
ah
suggest
coming
to
see
me
did
you
put
is
most
kind
or
is
more
than
kind
than
kind
said
nurse
rosemary
brokenly
right
for
it
is
indeed
more
than
kind
only
she
and
i
can
possibly
know
how
much
more
now
let
us
go
on
but
i
am
receiving
no
visitors
and
do
not
desire
any
until
i
have
so
mastered
my
new
circumstances
that
the
handicap
connected
with
them
shall
neither
be
painful
nor
very
noticeable
to
other
people
during
the
summer
i
shall
be
learning
step
by
step
to
live
this
new
life
in
complete
seclusion
at
gleneesh
i
feel
sure
my
friends
will
respect
my
wish
in
this
matter
i
have
with
me
one
who
most
perfectly
and
patiently
is
helping
ah
wait
cried
garth
suddenly
i
will
not
say
that
she
might
think
she
might
misunderstand
had
you
begun
to
write
it
no
what
was
the
last
word
ah
yes
that
is
right
full
stop
after
now
let
me
think
garth
dropped
his
face
into
his
hands
and
sat
for
a
long
time
absorbed
in
thought
nurse
rosemary
waited
her
right
hand
held
the
pen
poised
over
the
paper
her
left
was
pressed
against
her
breast
her
eyes
rested
on
that
dark
bowed
head
with
a
look
of
unutterable
yearning
and
of
passionate
tenderness
at
last
garth
lifted
his
face
yours
very
sincerely
garth
dalmain
he
said
and
silently
nurse
rosemary
wrote
it
chapter
xxii
dr
rob
to
the
rescue
into
the
somewhat
oppressive
silence
which
followed
the
addressing
and
closing
of
the
envelope
broke
the
cheery
voice
of
dr
rob
which
is
the
patient
the
lady
or
the
gentleman
ah
neither
i
see
both
flaunt
the
bloom
of
perfect
health
and
make
the
doctor
shy
it
is
spring
without
but
summer
within
ran
on
dr
rob
gaily
wondering
why
both
faces
were
so
white
and
perturbed
and
why
there
was
in
the
air
a
sense
of
hearts
in
torment
flannels
seem
to
call
up
boating
and
picnic
parties
and
i
see
you
have
discarded
the
merino
nurse
gray
and
returned
to
the
pretty
blue
washables
more
becoming
undoubtedly
only
do
take
cold
and
be
sure
you
feed
up
well
in
this
air
people
must
eat
plenty
and
you
have
been
perceptibly
losing
weight
lately
we
do
want
too
dimensions
why
do
you
always
chaff
miss
gray
about
being
small
dr
rob
asked
garth
in
a
rather
vexed
tone
i
am
sure
being
short
is
in
no
way
detrimental
to
her
i
will
chaff
her
about
being
tall
if
you
like
said
dr
rob
looking
at
her
with
a
wicked
twinkle
as
she
stood
in
the
window
drawn
up
to
her
full
height
and
regarding
him
with
cold
disapproval
i
would
sooner
no
comments
of
any
kind
were
made
upon
her
personal
appearance
said
garth
shortly
then
added
more
pleasantly
you
see
she
is
just
a
voice
to
me
a
kind
guiding
voice
at
first
i
used
to
form
mental
pictures
of
her
of
a
hazy
kind
but
now
i
prefer
to
appropriate
in
all
its
helpfulness
what
i
do
know
and
leave
unimagined
what
i
do
not
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
she
is
the
only
person
bar
that
fellow
johnson
who
belongs
to
a
nightmare
time
i
am
quickly
forgetting
i
have
yet
had
near
me
in
my
blindness
whom
i
had
not
already
seen
the
only
voice
i
have
ever
heard
to
which
i
could
not
put
a
face
and
figure
in
time
of
course
there
will
be
many
at
present
she
stands
alone
to
me
in
this
dr
rob
observant
eye
had
been
darting
about
during
this
explanation
seeking
to
focus
itself
upon
something
worthy
of
minute
examination
suddenly
he
spied
the
foreign
letter
lying
close
beside
him
on
the
table
hello
he
said
pyramids
the
egyptian
stamp
that
interesting
have
you
friends
out
there
mr
dalmain
that
letter
came
from
cairo
garth
replied
but
i
believe
miss
champion
has
by
now
gone
on
to
syria
dr
rob
attacked
his
moustache
and
stared
at
the
letter
meditatively
champion
he
repeated
champion
it
an
uncommon
name
is
your
correspondent
by
any
chance
the
honourable
jane
why
that
letter
is
from
her
replied
garth
surprised
do
you
know
her
his
voice
vibrated
eagerly
well
answered
dr
rob
with
slow
deliberation
i
know
her
face
and
i
know
her
voice
i
know
her
figure
and
i
know
a
pretty
good
deal
of
her
character
i
know
her
at
home
and
i
know
her
abroad
i
seen
her
under
fire
which
is
more
than
most
men
of
her
acquaintance
can
claim
but
there
is
one
thing
i
never
knew
until
and
that
is
her
handwriting
may
i
examine
this
envelope
he
turned
to
the
window
yes
this
audacious
little
scotchman
had
asked
the
question
of
nurse
rosemary
but
only
a
broad
blue
back
met
his
look
of
inquiry
nurse
rosemary
was
studying
the
view
he
turned
back
to
garth
who
had
evidently
already
made
a
sign
of
assent
and
on
whose
face
was
clearly
expressed
an
eager
desire
to
hear
more
and
an
extreme
disinclination
to
ask
for
it
mackenzie
took
up
the
envelope
and
pondered
it
yes
he
said
at
last
it
is
like
her
clear
firm
unwavering
knowing
what
it
means
to
say
and
saying
it
going
where
it
means
to
go
and
getting
there
ay
lad
it
a
grand
woman
that
and
if
you
have
the
honourable
jane
for
your
friend
you
can
be
doing
without
a
few
other
things
a
tinge
of
eager
colour
rose
in
garth
thin
cheeks
he
had
been
so
starved
in
his
darkness
for
want
of
some
word
concerning
her
from
that
outer
light
in
which
she
moved
he
had
felt
so
hopelessly
cut
off
from
all
chance
of
hearing
of
her
and
all
the
while
if
only
he
had
known
it
old
robbie
could
have
talked
of
her
he
had
had
to
question
brand
so
cautiously
fearing
to
betray
his
secret
and
hers
but
with
dr
rob
and
nurse
gray
no
such
precautions
were
needed
he
could
safely
guard
his
secret
and
yet
listen
and
speak
where
when
asked
garth
i
will
tell
you
where
and
i
will
tell
you
when
answered
dr
rob
if
you
feel
inclined
for
a
war
tale
on
this
peaceful
spring
morning
garth
was
aflame
with
eagerness
have
you
a
chair
doctor
he
said
and
has
miss
gray
a
chair
i
have
no
chair
sir
said
dr
rob
because
when
i
intend
thoroughly
to
enjoy
my
own
eloquence
it
is
my
custom
to
stand
nurse
gray
has
no
chair
because
she
is
standing
at
the
window
absorbed
in
the
view
she
has
apparently
ceased
to
pay
any
heed
to
you
and
me
you
will
very
rarely
find
one
woman
take
much
interest
in
tales
about
another
but
you
lean
back
in
your
own
chair
laddie
and
light
a
cigarette
and
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
to
see
you
do
it
too
and
better
than
pounding
the
wall
eh
all
of
which
we
may
consider
we
owe
to
the
lady
who
disdains
us
and
prefers
the
scenery
well
i
not
much
to
look
at
goodness
knows
and
she
can
see
you
all
the
rest
of
the
day
now
a
brand
worth
smoking
what
do
you
call
it
ah
and
yes
you
ca
better
that
for
and
garden
purposes
it
mingles
with
the
flowers
lean
back
and
enjoy
it
while
i
smell
for
i
will
tell
you
where
i
first
saw
the
honourable
jane
out
in
south
africa
in
the
very
thick
of
the
boer
war
i
had
volunteered
for
the
sake
of
the
surgery
experience
she
was
out
there
nursing
but
the
real
thing
mind
you
none
of
your
dabbling
in
with
lace
handkerchiefs
and
washing
handsome
faces
when
the
orderlies
had
washed
them
already
making
charming
conversation
to
men
who
were
getting
well
but
fleeing
in
dread
from
the
dead
or
the
dying
none
of
that
you
may
be
sure
and
none
of
that
allowed
in
her
hospital
for
miss
champion
was
in
command
there
and
i
can
tell
you
she
made
them
scoot
she
did
the
work
of
ten
and
expected
others
to
do
it
too
doctors
and
orderlies
adored
her
she
was
always
called
honourable
jane
most
of
the
men
sounding
the
h
and
pronouncing
the
title
as
four
syllables
ay
and
the
wounded
soldiers
there
was
many
a
lad
out
there
far
from
home
and
friends
who
when
death
came
died
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
sense
of
mother
and
home
quite
near
because
the
honourable
jane
arm
was
around
him
and
his
dying
head
rested
against
her
womanly
breast
her
voice
when
she
talked
to
them
no
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
to
hear
her
snap
at
the
women
and
order
along
the
men
and
then
turn
and
speak
to
a
sick
tommy
as
his
mother
or
his
sweetheart
would
have
wished
to
hear
him
spoken
to
was
a
lesson
in
from
which
i
am
profiting
still
and
that
big
loving
heart
must
often
have
been
racked
but
she
was
always
brave
and
bright
just
once
she
broke
down
it
was
over
a
boy
whom
she
tried
hard
to
save
quite
a
youngster
she
had
held
him
during
the
operation
which
was
his
only
chance
and
when
it
proved
no
good
and
he
lay
back
against
her
unconscious
she
quite
broke
down
and
said
doctor
a
mere
boy
and
to
suffer
so
and
then
die
like
this
and
gathered
him
to
her
and
wept
over
him
as
his
own
mother
might
have
done
the
surgeon
told
me
of
it
himself
he
said
the
hardest
hearts
in
the
tent
were
touched
and
softened
but
it
was
the
only
time
the
honourable
jane
broke
down
garth
shielded
his
face
with
his
hand
his
cigarette
fell
unheeded
to
the
floor
the
hand
that
had
held
it
was
clenched
on
his
knee
dr
rob
picked
it
up
and
rubbed
the
scorched
spot
on
the
carpet
carefully
with
his
foot
he
glanced
towards
the
window
nurse
rosemary
had
turned
and
was
leaning
against
the
frame
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
her
eyes
dwelt
with
troubled
anxiety
on
garth
i
came
across
her
several
times
at
different
centres
continued
dr
rob
but
we
were
not
in
the
same
departments
and
she
spoke
to
me
only
once
i
had
ridden
in
from
a
temporary
overflow
sort
of
place
where
we
were
dealing
with
the
worst
cases
straight
off
the
field
to
the
main
hospital
in
the
town
for
a
fresh
supply
of
chloroform
while
they
fetched
it
i
walked
round
the
ward
and
there
in
a
corner
was
miss
champion
kneeling
beside
a
man
whose
last
hour
was
very
near
talking
to
him
quietly
and
taking
measures
at
the
same
time
to
ease
his
pain
suddenly
there
came
a
crash
a
deafening
rush
and
another
crash
and
the
honourable
jane
and
her
patient
were
covered
with
dust
and
splinters
a
boer
shell
had
gone
clean
through
the
roof
just
over
their
heads
the
man
sat
up
yelling
with
fear
poor
chap
you
could
blame
him
dying
and
half
under
morphine
the
honourable
jane
never
turned
a
hair
down
my
man
she
said
keep
still
here
sobbed
the
man
right
said
the
honourable
jane
will
soon
move
you
then
she
turned
and
saw
me
i
was
in
the
most
nondescript
khaki
a
jacket
which
i
had
caught
up
on
leaving
the
tent
and
various
odds
and
ends
of
my
outfit
which
had
survived
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
campaign
also
i
was
dusty
with
a
long
gallop
serjeant
she
said
a
hand
with
this
poor
fellow
i
ca
have
him
disturbed
just
now
that
was
jane
only
comment
on
the
passing
of
a
shell
within
a
few
yards
of
her
own
head
do
you
wonder
the
men
adored
her
she
placed
her
hands
beneath
his
shoulders
and
signed
to
me
to
take
him
under
the
knees
and
together
we
carried
him
round
a
screen
out
of
the
ward
and
down
a
short
passage
turning
unexpectedly
into
a
quiet
little
room
with
a
comfortable
bed
and
photographs
and
books
arranged
on
the
tiny
she
said
if
you
please
serjeant
and
we
laid
him
on
the
bed
is
it
i
asked
she
looked
surprised
at
being
questioned
but
seeing
i
was
a
stranger
answered
civilly
and
then
noting
that
he
had
dozed
off
while
we
carried
him
added
he
will
have
done
with
beds
poor
chap
before
i
need
it
there
nerve
for
you
well
that
was
my
only
conversation
out
there
with
the
honourable
jane
soon
after
i
had
had
enough
and
came
home
garth
lifted
his
head
did
you
ever
meet
her
at
home
he
asked
i
did
said
dr
rob
but
she
did
not
remember
me
not
a
flicker
of
recognition
well
how
could
i
expect
it
i
wore
a
beard
out
there
no
time
to
shave
and
my
jacket
proclaimed
me
a
serjeant
not
a
surgeon
no
fault
of
hers
if
she
did
not
expect
to
meet
a
comrade
from
the
front
in
the
wilds
of
of
piccadilly
finished
dr
rob
lamely
now
having
spun
so
long
a
yarn
i
must
be
off
to
your
gardener
cot
in
the
wood
to
see
his
good
wife
who
has
had
what
he
pathetically
calls
increase
i
should
think
a
decrease
would
have
better
suited
the
size
of
his
house
but
first
i
must
interview
mistress
margery
in
the
she
is
anxious
about
herself
just
now
because
she
eat
bacon
she
says
it
flies
between
her
shoulders
so
erratic
a
deviation
from
its
normal
route
on
the
part
of
the
bacon
undoubtedly
requires
investigation
so
by
your
leave
i
will
ring
for
the
good
lady
not
just
yet
doctor
said
a
quiet
voice
from
the
window
i
want
to
see
you
in
the
and
will
follow
you
there
immediately
and
afterwards
while
you
investigate
margery
i
will
run
up
for
my
bonnet
and
walk
with
you
through
the
woods
if
dalmain
will
not
mind
an
hour
alone
when
jane
reached
the
robert
mackenzie
was
standing
on
the
in
a
napoleonic
attitude
just
as
on
the
morning
of
their
first
interview
he
looked
up
uncertainly
as
she
came
in
well
he
said
am
i
to
pay
the
piper
jane
came
straight
to
him
with
both
hands
extended
ah
serjeant
she
said
you
dear
faithful
old
serjeant
see
what
comes
of
wearing
another
man
coat
and
my
dilemma
comes
from
taking
another
woman
name
so
you
knew
me
all
the
time
from
the
first
moment
i
came
into
the
room
from
the
first
moment
you
entered
the
room
assented
dr
rob
why
did
you
not
say
so
asked
jane
well
i
concluded
you
had
your
reasons
for
being
rosemary
gray
and
it
did
not
come
within
my
province
to
question
your
identity
oh
you
dear
said
jane
was
there
ever
anything
so
shrewd
and
so
wise
and
so
bewilderingly
standing
on
two
legs
on
a
before
and
when
i
remember
how
you
said
you
have
arrived
nurse
gray
and
all
the
while
you
might
have
been
saying
do
you
do
miss
champion
and
what
brings
you
up
here
under
somebody
else
name
i
might
have
so
said
agreed
dr
rob
reflectively
but
praise
be
i
did
not
but
tell
me
said
jane
why
let
it
out
now
dr
rob
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
my
dear
i
am
an
old
fellow
and
all
my
life
i
have
made
it
my
business
to
know
without
being
told
you
have
been
coming
through
a
strain
a
prolonged
period
of
strain
sometimes
harder
sometimes
easier
but
never
quite
relaxed
a
strain
such
as
few
women
could
have
borne
it
was
not
only
with
him
you
had
to
keep
it
up
towards
us
all
i
knew
if
it
were
to
continue
you
must
soon
have
the
relief
of
some
one
with
whom
to
share
the
secret
some
one
towards
whom
you
could
be
yourself
occasionally
and
when
i
found
you
had
been
writing
to
him
here
sending
the
letter
to
be
posted
in
cairo
how
like
a
woman
to
strain
at
a
gnat
after
swallowing
such
a
camel
awaiting
its
return
day
after
day
then
obliged
to
read
it
to
him
yourself
and
take
down
his
dictated
answer
which
i
gathered
from
your
faces
when
i
entered
was
his
refusal
of
your
request
to
come
and
see
him
well
it
seemed
to
me
about
time
you
were
made
to
realise
that
you
might
as
well
confide
in
an
old
fellow
who
in
common
with
all
the
men
who
knew
you
in
south
africa
would
gladly
give
his
right
hand
for
the
honourable
jane
jane
looked
at
him
her
eyes
full
of
gratitude
for
the
moment
she
could
not
speak
but
tell
me
my
dear
said
dr
rob
tell
me
if
you
can
why
does
the
lad
put
from
him
so
firmly
that
which
if
indeed
it
might
be
his
for
the
asking
would
mean
for
him
so
great
so
wonderful
so
comforting
a
good
ah
doctor
said
jane
thereby
hangs
a
tale
of
sad
mistrust
and
mistake
and
the
mistrust
and
mistake
alas
were
mine
now
while
you
see
margery
i
will
prepare
for
walking
and
as
we
go
through
the
wood
i
will
try
to
tell
you
the
woeful
thing
which
came
between
him
and
me
and
placed
our
lives
so
far
apart
your
wise
advice
will
help
me
and
your
shrewd
knowledge
of
men
and
of
the
human
heart
may
find
us
a
way
out
for
indeed
we
are
shut
in
between
migdol
and
the
sea
as
jane
crossed
the
hall
and
was
about
to
mount
the
stairs
she
looked
towards
the
closed
library
door
a
sudden
fear
seized
her
lest
the
strain
of
listening
to
that
tale
of
dr
rob
had
been
too
much
for
garth
none
but
she
could
know
all
it
must
have
awakened
of
memory
to
be
told
so
vividly
of
the
dying
soldiers
whose
heads
were
pillowed
on
her
breast
and
the
strange
coincidence
of
those
words
a
mere
boy
and
to
suffer
so
she
could
not
leave
the
house
without
being
sure
he
was
safe
and
well
and
yet
she
instinctively
feared
to
intrude
when
he
imagined
himself
alone
for
an
hour
then
jane
in
her
anxiety
did
a
thing
she
had
never
done
before
she
opened
the
front
door
noiselessly
passed
round
the
house
to
the
terrace
and
when
approaching
the
open
window
of
the
library
trod
on
the
grass
border
and
reached
it
without
making
the
faintest
sound
never
before
had
she
come
upon
him
unawares
knowing
he
hated
and
dreaded
the
thought
of
an
unseen
intrusion
on
his
privacy
but
now
just
this
once
jane
looked
in
at
the
window
garth
sat
sideways
in
the
chair
his
arms
folded
on
the
table
beside
him
his
face
buried
in
them
he
was
sobbing
as
she
had
sometimes
heard
men
sob
after
agonising
operations
borne
without
a
sound
until
the
worst
was
over
and
garth
sob
of
agony
was
this
oh
my
wife
my
wife
my
wife
jane
crept
away
how
she
did
it
she
never
knew
but
some
instinct
told
her
that
to
reveal
herself
then
taking
him
at
a
disadvantage
when
dr
rob
story
had
unnerved
and
unmanned
him
would
be
to
ruin
all
if
you
value
your
ultimate
happiness
and
his
deryck
voice
always
sounded
in
warning
besides
it
was
such
a
short
postponement
in
the
calm
earnest
thought
which
would
succeed
this
storm
his
need
of
her
would
win
the
day
the
letter
not
yet
posted
would
be
rewritten
he
would
say
come
and
the
next
minute
he
would
be
in
her
arms
so
jane
turned
noiselessly
away
coming
in
an
hour
later
from
her
walk
with
dr
rob
her
heart
filled
with
glad
anticipation
she
found
him
standing
in
the
window
listening
to
the
countless
sounds
he
was
learning
to
distinguish
he
looked
so
slim
and
tall
and
straight
in
his
white
flannels
both
hands
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
that
when
he
turned
at
her
approach
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
shining
eyes
must
be
there
was
it
lovely
in
the
woods
he
asked
simpson
shall
take
me
up
there
after
lunch
meanwhile
is
there
time
if
you
are
not
tired
miss
gray
to
finish
our
morning
work
five
letters
were
dictated
and
a
cheque
written
then
jane
noticed
that
hers
to
him
had
gone
from
among
the
rest
but
his
to
her
lay
on
the
table
ready
for
stamping
she
hesitated
and
about
the
letter
to
miss
champion
she
said
do
you
wish
it
to
go
as
it
is
mr
dalmain
why
certainly
he
said
did
we
not
finish
it
i
thought
said
jane
nervously
looking
away
from
his
blank
face
i
thought
perhaps
after
dr
rob
story
you
might
dr
rob
story
could
make
no
possible
difference
as
to
whether
i
should
let
her
come
here
or
not
said
garth
emphatically
then
added
more
gently
it
only
reminded
me
of
what
asked
jane
her
hands
upon
her
breast
of
what
a
glorious
woman
she
is
said
garth
dalmain
and
blew
a
long
steady
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
summer
air
chapter
xxiii
the
only
way
when
deryck
brand
alighted
at
the
little
northern
wayside
station
he
looked
up
and
down
the
gravelled
platform
more
than
half
expecting
to
see
jane
the
hour
was
early
but
she
invariably
said
so
much
the
better
to
any
plan
which
involved
rising
earlier
than
usual
nothing
was
to
be
seen
however
but
his
portmanteau
in
the
distance
looking
as
if
it
had
taken
up
a
solitary
and
permanent
position
where
the
guard
had
placed
it
and
one
slow
porter
who
appeared
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
fact
that
he
alone
was
on
duty
to
receive
the
train
there
were
no
other
passengers
descending
there
was
no
other
baggage
to
put
out
the
guard
swung
up
into
his
van
as
the
train
moved
off
the
old
porter
shading
his
eyes
from
the
slanting
rays
of
the
morning
sun
watched
the
train
glide
round
the
curve
and
disappear
from
sight
then
slowly
turned
and
looked
the
other
way
as
if
to
make
sure
there
was
not
another
coming
saw
the
portmanteau
and
shambled
towards
it
he
stood
looking
down
upon
it
pensively
then
moved
slowly
round
apparently
reading
the
names
and
particulars
of
all
the
various
continental
hotels
at
which
the
portmanteau
had
recently
stayed
with
its
owner
dr
brand
never
hurried
people
he
always
said
it
answers
best
in
the
long
run
to
let
them
take
their
own
time
the
minute
or
two
gained
by
hurrying
them
is
lost
in
the
final
results
but
this
applied
chiefly
to
patients
in
the
to
anxious
young
students
in
hospital
or
to
nurses
too
excitedly
conscious
at
first
of
the
fact
that
he
was
talking
to
them
to
take
in
fully
what
he
was
saying
his
habit
of
giving
people
even
in
final
moments
the
full
time
they
wanted
had
once
lost
him
an
overcoat
almost
lost
him
a
train
and
won
him
the
thing
in
life
he
most
desired
but
that
belongs
to
another
story
meanwhile
he
wanted
his
breakfast
on
this
fresh
spring
morning
and
he
wanted
to
see
jane
therefore
as
porter
and
portmanteau
made
no
advance
towards
him
the
doctor
strode
down
the
platform
now
then
my
man
he
called
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
scotch
porter
i
want
my
portmanteau
would
this
be
your
portmanteau
inquired
the
porter
doubtfully
it
would
said
the
doctor
and
it
and
i
would
be
on
our
way
to
castle
gleneesh
if
you
would
be
bringing
it
out
and
putting
it
into
the
motor
which
i
see
waiting
outside
i
will
be
fetching
a
truck
said
the
porter
but
when
he
returned
carefully
trundling
it
behind
him
the
doctor
the
portmanteau
and
the
motor
were
all
out
of
sight
the
porter
shaded
his
eyes
and
gazed
up
the
road
i
will
be
hoping
it
was
his
portmanteau
he
said
and
went
back
to
his
porridge
meanwhile
the
doctor
sped
up
into
the
hills
his
mind
alight
with
eagerness
to
meet
jane
and
to
learn
the
developments
of
the
last
few
days
her
at
the
railway
station
filled
him
with
an
undefinable
anxiety
it
would
have
been
so
like
jane
to
have
been
there
prompt
to
seize
the
chance
of
a
talk
with
him
alone
before
he
reached
the
house
he
had
called
up
in
anticipation
such
a
vivid
picture
of
her
waiting
on
the
platform
bright
alert
vigorous
with
that
fresh
and
healthy
vigour
which
betokens
a
good
night
rest
a
pleasant
early
awakening
and
a
cold
tub
recently
enjoyed
and
the
disappointment
of
not
seeing
her
had
wrought
in
him
a
strange
foreboding
what
if
her
nerve
had
given
way
under
the
strain
they
turned
a
bend
in
the
winding
road
and
the
grey
turrets
of
gleneesh
came
in
sight
high
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
glen
the
moor
stretching
away
behind
and
above
it
as
they
wound
up
the
valley
to
the
moorland
road
which
would
bring
them
round
to
the
house
the
doctor
could
see
in
the
clear
morning
light
the
broad
lawn
and
terrace
of
gleneesh
with
its
gay
smooth
gravelled
walks
and
broad
stone
parapet
from
which
was
a
drop
almost
sheer
down
into
the
glen
below
simpson
received
him
at
the
hall
door
and
he
just
stopped
himself
in
time
as
he
was
about
to
ask
for
miss
champion
this
perilous
approach
to
a
slip
reminded
him
how
carefully
he
must
guard
words
and
actions
in
this
house
where
jane
had
successfully
steered
her
intricate
course
he
would
never
forgive
himself
if
he
gave
her
away
dalmain
is
in
the
library
sir
deryck
said
simpson
and
it
was
a
very
alert
doctor
who
followed
the
man
across
the
hall
garth
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
forward
to
meet
him
his
right
hand
outstretched
a
smile
of
welcome
on
his
face
and
so
direct
and
unhesitating
a
course
that
the
doctor
had
to
glance
at
the
sightless
face
to
make
sure
that
this
lithe
graceful
figure
was
indeed
the
blind
man
he
had
come
to
see
then
he
noticed
a
length
of
brown
silk
cord
stretched
from
an
arm
of
the
chair
garth
had
quitted
to
the
door
garth
left
hand
had
slipped
lightly
along
it
as
he
walked
the
doctor
put
his
hand
into
the
one
outstretched
and
gripped
it
warmly
my
dear
fellow
what
a
change
is
it
said
garth
delightedly
and
it
is
entirely
she
who
has
worked
it
the
capital
little
woman
you
sent
up
to
me
i
want
to
tell
you
how
she
is
he
had
reached
his
chair
again
and
found
and
drew
forward
for
the
doctor
the
one
in
which
jane
usually
sat
this
is
her
own
idea
he
unhitched
the
cord
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
a
fine
string
remaining
attached
to
it
and
to
the
chair
by
which
he
could
draw
it
up
again
at
will
there
is
one
on
this
side
leading
to
the
piano
and
one
here
to
the
window
now
how
should
you
know
them
apart
they
are
brown
purple
and
orange
replied
the
doctor
yes
said
garth
you
know
them
by
the
colours
but
i
distinguish
them
by
a
slight
difference
in
the
thickness
and
in
the
texture
which
you
could
not
see
but
which
i
can
feel
and
i
enjoy
thinking
of
the
colours
too
and
sometimes
i
wear
ties
and
things
to
match
them
you
see
i
know
exactly
how
they
look
and
it
was
so
like
her
to
remember
that
an
ordinary
nurse
would
have
put
red
green
and
blue
and
i
should
have
sat
and
hated
the
thought
of
them
knowing
how
vilely
they
must
be
clashing
with
my
persian
carpet
but
she
understands
how
much
colours
mean
to
me
even
though
i
can
not
see
them
i
conclude
that
by
you
mean
nurse
rosemary
said
the
doctor
i
am
glad
she
is
a
success
a
success
exclaimed
garth
why
she
helped
me
to
live
again
i
am
ashamed
to
remember
how
at
the
bottom
of
all
things
i
was
when
you
came
up
before
brand
just
pounding
the
wall
as
old
robbie
expresses
it
you
must
have
thought
me
a
fool
and
a
coward
i
thought
you
neither
my
dear
fellow
you
were
coming
through
a
stiffer
fight
than
any
of
us
have
been
called
to
face
thank
god
you
have
won
i
owe
a
lot
to
you
brand
and
still
more
to
miss
gray
i
wish
she
were
here
to
see
you
she
is
away
for
the
away
j
just
now
exclaimed
the
doctor
almost
surprised
into
another
slip
yes
she
went
last
night
she
is
in
the
neighbourhood
she
said
she
was
not
going
far
and
should
be
back
with
me
early
on
monday
morning
but
she
seemed
to
want
a
change
of
scene
and
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
as
i
shall
have
you
here
most
of
the
time
i
say
brand
i
do
think
it
is
extraordinarily
good
of
you
to
come
all
this
way
to
see
me
you
know
from
such
a
man
as
yourself
it
is
almost
overwhelming
you
must
not
be
overwhelmed
my
dear
chap
and
though
i
very
truly
came
to
see
you
i
am
also
up
about
another
old
friend
in
the
near
neighbourhood
in
whom
i
am
interested
i
only
mention
this
in
order
to
be
quite
honest
and
to
lift
from
off
you
any
possible
burden
of
feeling
yourself
my
only
patient
oh
thanks
said
garth
it
lessens
my
compunction
without
diminishing
my
gratitude
and
now
you
must
be
wanting
a
brush
up
and
breakfast
and
here
am
i
selfishly
keeping
you
from
both
and
i
say
brand
garth
coloured
hotly
boyishly
and
hesitated
i
am
awfully
sorry
you
will
have
no
companion
at
your
meals
miss
gray
being
away
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
you
having
them
alone
but
i
i
always
have
mine
by
myself
simpson
attends
to
them
he
could
not
see
the
doctor
quick
look
of
comprehension
but
the
understanding
sympathy
of
the
tone
in
which
he
said
ah
yes
yes
of
course
without
further
comment
helped
garth
to
add
i
could
even
have
miss
gray
with
me
we
always
take
our
meals
apart
you
can
not
imagine
how
awful
it
is
chasing
your
food
all
round
your
plate
and
never
sure
it
is
not
on
the
cloth
after
all
or
on
your
tie
while
you
are
hunting
for
it
elsewhere
no
i
ca
imagine
said
the
doctor
no
one
could
who
had
not
been
through
it
but
can
you
bear
it
better
with
simpson
than
with
nurse
rosemary
she
is
trained
to
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
garth
coloured
again
well
you
see
simpson
is
the
chap
who
shaves
me
and
gets
me
into
my
clothes
and
takes
me
about
and
though
it
will
always
be
a
trial
it
is
a
trial
to
which
i
am
growing
accustomed
you
might
put
it
thus
simpson
is
eyes
to
my
body
miss
gray
is
vision
to
my
mind
simpson
is
the
only
touch
which
cores
to
me
in
the
darkness
do
you
know
miss
gray
has
never
touched
me
not
even
to
shake
hands
i
am
awfully
glad
of
this
i
will
tell
you
why
presently
if
i
may
it
makes
her
just
a
mind
and
voice
to
me
and
nothing
more
but
a
wonderfully
kind
and
helpful
voice
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
live
without
her
garth
rang
the
bell
and
simpson
appeared
take
sir
deryck
to
his
room
and
he
will
tell
you
what
time
he
would
like
breakfast
and
when
you
have
seen
to
it
all
simpson
i
will
go
out
for
a
turn
then
i
shall
be
free
brand
when
you
are
but
do
not
give
me
any
more
time
this
morning
if
you
ought
to
be
resting
or
out
on
the
moors
having
a
holiday
from
minds
and
men
the
doctor
tubbed
and
got
into
his
knickerbockers
and
an
old
norfolk
jacket
then
found
his
way
to
the
and
did
full
justice
to
an
excellent
breakfast
he
was
still
pondering
the
problem
of
jane
and
at
the
same
time
wondering
in
another
compartment
of
his
mind
in
what
sort
of
machine
old
margery
made
her
excellent
coffee
when
that
good
lady
appeared
enveloped
in
an
air
of
mystery
and
the
doctor
immediately
propounded
the
question
a
jug
said
old
margery
and
would
you
be
coming
with
me
sir
deryck
and
softly
whenever
you
have
finished
your
breakfast
softly
said
margery
again
as
they
crossed
the
hall
the
tall
figure
closely
following
in
her
portly
wake
after
mounting
a
few
stairs
she
turned
to
whisper
impressively
it
is
not
what
ye
make
it
in
it
is
how
ye
make
it
she
ascended
a
few
more
steps
then
turned
to
say
it
all
hangs
upon
the
word
fresh
and
went
on
mounting
freshly
roasted
freshly
ground
water
said
old
margery
reaching
the
topmost
stair
somewhat
breathless
then
turning
bustled
along
a
rather
dark
passage
thickly
carpeted
and
hung
with
old
armour
and
pictures
where
are
we
going
mistress
margery
asked
the
doctor
adapting
his
stride
to
her
trot
one
to
two
you
will
be
seeing
whenever
we
get
there
sir
deryck
said
margery
and
never
touch
it
with
metal
sir
deryck
pop
it
into
an
earthenware
jug
pour
your
boiling
water
straight
upon
it
stir
it
with
a
wooden
spoon
set
it
on
the
hob
ten
minutes
to
settle
the
grounds
will
all
go
to
the
bottom
though
you
might
not
think
it
and
you
pour
it
out
fragrant
strong
and
clear
but
the
secret
is
fresh
fresh
fresh
and
do
stint
your
coffee
old
margery
paused
before
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
knocked
lightly
then
looked
up
at
the
doctor
with
her
hand
on
the
and
an
expression
of
pleading
earnestness
in
her
faithful
scotch
eyes
and
you
will
not
forget
the
wooden
spoon
sir
deryck
the
doctor
looked
down
into
the
kind
old
face
raised
to
his
in
the
dim
light
i
will
not
forget
the
wooden
spoon
mistress
margery
he
said
gravely
and
old
margery
turning
the
handle
whispered
mysteriously
into
the
doorway
it
will
be
sir
deryck
miss
gray
and
ushered
the
doctor
into
a
cosy
little
a
bright
fire
burned
in
the
grate
in
a
in
front
of
it
sat
jane
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
he
could
only
see
the
top
of
her
head
and
her
long
grey
knees
but
both
were
unmistakably
jane
oh
dicky
she
said
and
a
great
thankfulness
was
in
her
voice
is
it
you
oh
come
in
boy
and
shut
the
door
are
we
alone
come
round
here
quick
and
shake
hands
or
i
shall
be
plunging
about
trying
to
find
you
in
a
moment
the
doctor
had
reached
the
dropped
on
one
knee
in
front
of
the
large
chair
and
took
the
vaguely
groping
hands
held
out
to
him
jeanette
he
said
jeanette
and
then
surprise
and
emotion
silenced
him
jane
eyes
were
securely
bandaged
a
black
silk
scarf
folded
in
four
thicknesses
was
firmly
tied
at
the
back
of
her
smooth
coils
of
hair
there
was
a
pathetic
helplessness
about
her
large
capable
figure
sitting
alone
in
this
bright
little
doing
nothing
jeanette
said
the
doctor
for
the
third
time
and
you
call
this
dear
said
jane
i
have
gone
into
sightless
land
for
my
oh
deryck
i
had
to
do
it
the
only
way
really
to
help
him
is
to
know
exactly
what
it
means
in
all
the
small
trying
details
i
never
had
much
imagination
and
i
have
exhausted
what
little
i
had
and
he
never
complains
or
explains
how
things
come
hardest
so
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
have
hours
of
it
one
self
old
margery
and
simpson
quite
enter
into
it
and
are
helping
me
splendidly
simpson
keeps
the
coast
clear
if
we
want
to
come
down
or
go
out
because
with
two
blind
people
about
it
would
be
a
complication
if
they
ran
into
one
another
margery
helps
me
with
all
the
things
in
which
i
am
helpless
and
oh
dicky
you
would
never
believe
how
many
they
are
and
the
awful
awful
dark
a
black
curtain
always
in
front
of
you
sometimes
seeming
hard
and
firm
like
a
wall
of
coal
within
an
inch
of
your
face
sometimes
sinking
away
into
soft
depths
of
blackness
miles
and
miles
of
distant
silent
horrible
darkness
until
you
feel
you
must
fall
forward
into
it
and
be
submerged
and
overwhelmed
and
out
of
that
darkness
come
voices
and
if
they
speak
loudly
they
hit
you
like
tapping
hammers
and
if
they
murmur
indistinctly
they
madden
you
because
you
ca
see
what
is
causing
it
you
ca
see
that
they
are
holding
pins
in
their
mouths
and
that
therefore
they
are
mumbling
or
that
they
are
half
under
the
bed
trying
to
get
out
something
which
has
rolled
there
and
therefore
the
voice
seems
to
come
from
somewhere
beneath
the
earth
and
because
you
can
not
see
these
things
to
account
for
it
the
variableness
of
sound
torments
you
ah
and
the
waking
in
the
morning
to
the
same
blackness
as
you
have
had
all
night
i
have
experienced
it
just
once
i
began
my
darkness
before
dinner
last
night
and
i
assure
you
deryck
i
dread
morning
think
what
it
must
be
to
wake
to
that
always
with
no
prospect
of
ever
again
seeing
the
sunlight
and
then
the
meals
what
you
keep
it
on
the
doctor
voice
sounded
rather
strained
of
course
said
jane
and
you
can
not
imagine
the
humiliation
of
following
your
food
all
round
the
plate
and
then
finding
it
on
the
of
being
quite
sure
there
was
a
last
bit
somewhere
and
when
you
had
given
up
the
search
and
gone
on
to
another
course
discovering
it
eventually
in
your
lap
i
do
not
wonder
my
poor
boy
would
not
let
me
come
to
his
meals
but
after
this
i
believe
he
will
and
i
shall
know
exactly
how
to
help
him
and
how
to
arrange
so
that
very
soon
he
will
have
no
difficulty
oh
dicky
i
had
to
do
it
there
was
no
other
way
yes
said
the
doctor
quietly
you
had
to
do
it
and
jane
in
her
blindness
could
not
see
the
working
of
his
face
as
he
added
below
his
breath
you
being
you
dear
there
was
no
other
way
ah
how
glad
i
am
you
realise
the
necessity
deryck
i
had
so
feared
you
might
think
it
useless
or
foolish
and
it
was
now
or
never
because
i
trust
if
he
forgives
me
this
will
be
the
only
i
shall
ever
have
to
spend
away
from
him
boy
do
you
think
he
will
forgive
me
it
was
fortunate
jane
was
blind
the
doctor
swallowed
a
word
then
hush
dear
he
said
you
make
me
sigh
for
the
duchess
parrot
and
i
shall
do
no
good
here
if
i
lose
patience
with
dalmain
now
tell
me
you
really
never
remove
that
bandage
only
to
wash
my
face
replied
jane
smiling
i
can
trust
myself
not
to
peep
for
two
minutes
and
last
night
i
found
it
made
my
head
so
hot
that
i
could
not
sleep
so
i
slipped
it
off
for
an
hour
or
two
but
woke
and
put
it
on
again
before
dawn
and
you
mean
to
wear
it
until
morning
jane
smiled
rather
wistfully
she
knew
what
was
involved
in
that
question
until
night
boy
she
answered
gently
but
jeanette
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
indignant
protest
surely
you
will
see
me
before
i
go
my
dear
girl
would
it
not
be
carrying
the
experiment
unnecessarily
far
ah
no
said
jane
leaning
towards
him
with
her
pathetic
bandaged
eyes
do
you
see
dear
you
give
me
the
chance
of
passing
through
what
will
in
time
be
one
of
his
hardest
experiences
when
his
dearest
friends
will
come
and
go
and
be
to
him
only
voice
and
touch
their
faces
unseen
and
but
dimly
remembered
deryck
just
because
this
hearing
and
not
seeing
you
is
so
hard
i
realise
how
it
is
enriching
me
in
what
i
can
share
with
him
he
must
not
have
to
say
but
you
saw
him
before
he
left
i
want
to
be
able
to
say
came
and
went
my
greatest
friend
and
i
did
not
see
him
at
all
the
doctor
walked
over
to
the
window
and
stood
there
whistling
softly
jane
knew
he
was
fighting
down
his
own
vexation
she
waited
patiently
presently
the
whistling
stopped
and
she
heard
him
laugh
then
he
came
back
and
sat
down
near
her
you
always
were
a
thorough
old
thing
he
said
no
would
do
i
suppose
i
must
agree
jane
reached
out
for
his
hand
ah
boy
she
said
now
you
will
help
me
but
i
never
before
knew
you
so
nearly
selfish
the
man
is
always
a
problem
said
the
doctor
we
male
brutes
by
nature
always
want
to
be
first
with
all
our
women
not
merely
with
the
one
but
with
all
those
in
whom
we
consider
sometimes
with
egregious
presumption
that
we
hold
a
right
you
see
it
everywhere
fathers
towards
their
daughters
brothers
as
regards
their
sisters
friends
in
a
friendship
the
man
when
he
arrives
is
always
a
pill
to
swallow
it
is
only
natural
i
suppose
but
it
is
fallen
nature
and
therefore
to
be
surmounted
now
let
me
go
and
forage
for
your
hat
and
coat
and
take
you
out
upon
the
moors
no
why
not
i
often
find
things
for
flower
so
really
i
know
likely
places
in
which
to
search
oh
all
right
i
will
send
margery
but
do
be
long
and
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
dalmain
hearing
us
for
i
saw
him
just
now
walking
briskly
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
only
an
occasional
touch
of
his
cane
against
the
parapet
how
much
you
have
already
accomplished
we
shall
talk
more
freely
out
on
the
moor
and
as
i
march
you
along
we
can
find
out
tips
which
may
be
useful
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
lead
the
man
about
only
do
be
careful
how
you
come
downstairs
with
old
margery
think
if
you
fell
upon
her
jane
she
does
make
such
excellent
coffee
chapter
xxiv
the
man
point
of
view
a
deep
peace
reigned
in
the
library
at
gleneesh
garth
and
deryck
sat
together
and
smoked
in
complete
fellowship
enjoying
that
sense
of
calm
content
which
follows
an
excellent
dinner
and
a
day
spent
in
moorland
air
jane
sitting
upstairs
in
her
darkness
with
nothing
to
do
but
listen
fancied
she
could
hear
the
low
hum
of
quiet
voices
in
the
room
beneath
carrying
on
a
more
or
less
continuous
conversation
it
was
a
pity
she
could
not
see
them
as
they
sat
together
each
looking
his
very
best
garth
in
the
dinner
jacket
which
suited
his
slight
upright
figure
so
well
the
doctor
in
immaculate
evening
clothes
of
the
latest
cut
and
fashion
which
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
bring
knowing
jane
expected
the
men
of
her
acquaintance
to
be
punctilious
in
the
matter
of
evening
dress
and
little
dreaming
she
would
have
literally
no
eyes
for
him
and
indeed
the
doctor
himself
was
fastidious
to
a
degree
where
clothes
were
concerned
and
always
well
groomed
and
unquestionably
correct
in
cut
and
fashion
excepting
in
the
case
of
his
favourite
old
norfolk
jacket
this
he
kept
for
occasions
when
he
intended
to
be
what
he
called
happy
and
glorious
though
lady
brand
made
gentle
but
persistent
attempts
to
dispose
of
it
the
old
norfolk
jacket
had
walked
the
moors
that
morning
with
jane
she
had
recognised
the
feel
of
it
as
he
drew
her
hand
within
his
arm
and
they
had
laughed
over
its
many
associations
but
now
simpson
was
folding
it
and
putting
it
away
and
a
very
correctly
clad
doctor
sat
in
an
in
front
of
the
library
fire
his
long
legs
crossed
the
one
over
the
other
his
broad
shoulders
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
chair
garth
sat
where
he
could
feel
the
warm
flame
of
the
fire
pleasant
in
the
chill
evening
which
succeeded
the
bright
spring
day
his
chair
was
placed
sideways
so
that
he
could
with
his
hand
shield
his
face
from
his
visitor
should
he
wish
to
do
so
yes
dr
brand
was
saying
thoughtfully
i
can
easily
see
that
all
things
which
reach
you
in
that
darkness
assume
a
different
proportion
and
possess
a
greatly
enhanced
value
but
i
think
you
will
find
as
time
goes
on
and
you
come
in
contact
with
more
people
there
will
be
a
great
readjustment
and
you
will
become
less
consciously
sensitive
to
sound
and
touch
from
others
at
present
your
whole
nervous
system
is
highly
strung
and
responds
with
an
exaggerated
vibration
to
every
impression
made
upon
it
a
highly
strung
nervous
system
usually
exaggerates
and
the
medium
of
sight
having
been
taken
away
the
other
means
of
communication
with
the
outer
world
hearing
and
touch
draw
to
themselves
an
overplus
of
nervous
force
and
have
become
painfully
sensitive
eventually
things
will
right
themselves
and
they
will
only
be
usefully
keen
and
acute
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
nurse
rosemary
not
shaking
hands
ah
yes
said
garth
but
first
i
want
to
ask
is
it
a
rule
of
her
order
or
guild
or
institution
or
whatever
it
is
to
which
she
belongs
that
the
nurses
should
never
shake
hands
with
their
patients
not
that
i
have
ever
heard
replied
the
doctor
well
then
it
must
have
been
miss
gray
own
perfect
intuition
as
to
what
i
want
and
what
i
do
want
for
from
the
very
first
she
has
never
shaken
hands
nor
in
any
way
touched
me
even
in
passing
across
letters
and
handing
me
things
as
she
does
scores
of
times
daily
never
once
have
i
felt
her
fingers
against
mine
and
this
pleases
you
inquired
the
doctor
blowing
smoke
rings
into
the
air
and
watching
the
blind
face
intently
ah
i
am
so
grateful
for
it
said
garth
earnestly
do
you
know
brand
when
you
suggested
sending
me
a
lady
nurse
and
secretary
i
felt
i
could
not
possibly
stand
having
a
woman
touch
me
so
you
said
commented
the
doctor
quietly
no
did
i
what
a
bear
you
must
have
thought
me
by
no
means
said
the
doctor
but
a
distinctly
unusual
patient
as
a
rule
men
ah
i
dare
say
garth
interposed
half
impatiently
there
was
a
time
when
i
should
have
liked
a
soft
little
hand
about
me
and
i
dare
say
by
now
i
should
often
enough
have
caught
it
and
held
it
perhaps
kissed
it
who
knows
i
used
to
do
such
things
lightly
enough
but
brand
when
a
man
has
known
the
touch
of
the
woman
and
when
that
touch
has
become
nothing
but
a
memory
when
one
is
dashed
into
darkness
and
that
memory
becomes
one
of
the
few
things
which
remain
and
remaining
brings
untold
comfort
can
you
wonder
if
one
fears
another
touch
which
might
in
any
way
dim
that
memory
supersede
it
or
take
away
from
its
utter
sacredness
i
understand
said
the
doctor
slowly
it
does
not
come
within
my
own
experience
but
i
understand
only
my
dear
boy
may
i
say
it
if
the
one
woman
exists
and
it
is
excusable
in
your
case
to
doubt
it
because
there
were
so
many
surely
her
place
should
be
here
her
actual
touch
one
of
the
things
which
remain
ah
say
it
answered
garth
lighting
another
cigarette
i
like
to
hear
it
said
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
might
as
well
say
that
if
the
view
from
the
terrace
exists
i
ought
to
be
able
to
see
it
the
view
is
there
right
enough
but
my
own
deficiency
keeps
me
from
seeing
it
in
other
words
said
the
doctor
leaning
forward
and
picking
up
the
match
which
not
being
thrown
so
straight
as
usual
had
just
missed
the
fire
in
other
words
though
she
was
the
one
woman
you
were
not
the
one
man
yes
said
garth
bitterly
but
almost
beneath
his
breath
i
was
mere
boy
or
you
thought
you
were
not
continued
the
doctor
seeming
not
to
have
heard
the
last
remark
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
always
the
one
man
to
the
one
woman
unless
another
is
before
you
in
the
field
only
it
may
take
time
and
patience
to
prove
it
to
her
garth
sat
up
and
turned
a
face
of
blank
surprise
towards
the
doctor
what
an
extraordinary
statement
he
said
do
you
really
mean
it
absolutely
replied
the
doctor
in
a
tone
of
quiet
conviction
if
you
eliminate
all
other
considerations
such
as
money
lands
titles
wishes
of
friends
attraction
of
exteriors
that
is
to
say
admiration
of
mere
physical
beauty
in
one
another
which
is
after
all
just
a
question
of
comparative
anatomy
if
freed
of
all
this
social
and
habitual
environment
you
could
place
the
man
and
the
woman
in
a
mental
garden
of
eden
and
let
them
face
one
another
stripped
of
all
shams
and
conventionalities
soul
viewing
soul
naked
and
unashamed
if
under
those
circumstances
she
is
so
truly
his
mate
that
all
the
noblest
of
the
man
cries
out
is
the
one
woman
then
i
say
so
truly
is
he
her
mate
that
he
can
not
fail
to
be
the
one
man
only
he
must
have
the
confidence
required
to
prove
it
to
her
on
him
it
bursts
as
a
revelation
on
her
it
dawns
slowly
as
the
breaking
of
the
day
oh
my
god
murmured
garth
brokenly
it
was
just
that
the
garden
of
eden
soul
to
soul
with
no
reservations
nothing
to
fear
nothing
to
hide
i
realised
her
my
wife
and
called
her
so
and
the
next
morning
she
called
me
mere
boy
whom
she
could
not
for
a
moment
think
of
marrying
so
what
becomes
of
your
fool
theory
brand
confirmed
replied
the
doctor
quietly
eve
afraid
of
the
immensity
of
her
bliss
doubtful
of
herself
fearful
of
coming
short
of
the
marvel
of
his
ideal
of
her
fleeing
from
adam
to
hide
among
the
trees
of
the
garden
do
talk
about
fool
theories
my
boy
the
was
adam
if
he
did
not
start
in
prompt
pursuit
garth
sat
forward
his
hands
clutching
the
arms
of
his
chair
that
quiet
level
voice
was
awakening
doubts
as
to
his
view
of
the
situation
the
first
he
had
had
since
the
moment
of
turning
and
walking
down
the
shenstone
village
church
three
years
ago
his
face
was
livid
and
as
the
firelight
played
upon
it
the
doctor
saw
beads
of
perspiration
gleam
on
his
forehead
oh
brand
he
said
i
am
blind
be
merciful
things
mean
so
terribly
much
in
the
dark
the
doctor
considered
could
his
nurses
and
students
have
seen
the
look
on
his
face
at
that
moment
they
would
have
said
that
he
was
performing
a
most
critical
and
delicate
operation
in
which
a
slip
of
the
scalpel
might
mean
death
to
the
patient
they
would
have
been
right
for
the
whole
future
of
two
people
hung
in
the
balance
depending
in
this
crisis
upon
the
doctor
firmness
and
yet
delicacy
of
touch
this
strained
white
face
in
the
firelight
with
its
beads
of
mental
agony
and
its
appealing
i
am
blind
had
not
entered
into
the
calculations
it
was
a
view
of
the
other
man
upon
which
he
could
not
look
unmoved
but
the
thought
of
that
patient
figure
with
bandaged
eyes
sitting
upstairs
in
suspense
stretching
dear
helpless
hands
to
him
steadied
the
doctor
nerve
he
looked
into
the
fire
you
may
be
blind
dalmain
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
a
fool
said
the
doctor
quietly
am
i
was
i
a
fool
asked
garth
how
can
i
judge
replied
the
doctor
give
me
a
clear
account
of
the
circumstances
from
your
point
of
view
and
i
will
give
you
my
opinion
of
the
case
his
tone
was
so
completely
dispassionate
and
that
it
had
a
calming
effect
on
garth
giving
him
also
a
sense
of
security
the
doctor
might
have
been
speaking
of
a
sore
throat
or
a
tendency
to
sciatica
garth
leaned
back
in
his
chair
slipped
his
hand
into
the
of
his
jacket
and
touched
a
letter
lying
there
dare
he
risk
it
could
he
for
once
take
for
himself
the
comfort
of
speaking
of
his
trouble
to
a
man
he
could
completely
trust
and
yet
avoid
the
danger
of
betraying
her
identity
to
one
who
knew
her
so
intimately
garth
weighed
this
after
the
manner
of
a
looking
several
moves
ahead
could
the
conversation
become
more
explicit
sufficiently
so
to
be
of
use
and
yet
no
clue
be
given
which
would
reveal
jane
as
the
one
woman
had
the
doctor
uttered
a
word
of
pressure
or
suggestion
garth
would
have
decided
for
silence
but
the
doctor
did
not
speak
he
leaned
forward
and
reached
the
poker
mending
the
fire
with
extreme
care
and
method
he
placed
a
fragrant
pine
log
upon
the
springing
flame
and
as
he
did
so
he
whistled
softly
the
closing
bars
of
veni
creator
spiritus
garth
occupied
with
his
own
mental
struggle
was
for
once
oblivious
to
sounds
from
without
and
did
not
realise
why
at
this
critical
moment
these
words
should
have
come
with
gentle
insistence
into
his
mind
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
he
took
them
as
an
omen
they
turned
the
scale
brand
he
said
if
as
you
are
so
kind
as
to
suggest
i
give
myself
the
extreme
relief
of
confiding
in
you
will
you
promise
me
never
to
attempt
to
guess
at
the
identity
of
the
one
woman
the
doctor
smiled
and
the
smile
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
added
to
garth
sense
of
security
my
dear
fellow
he
said
i
never
guess
at
other
people
secrets
it
is
a
form
of
mental
recreation
which
does
not
appeal
to
me
and
which
i
should
find
neither
entertaining
nor
remunerative
if
i
know
them
already
i
do
not
require
to
guess
them
if
i
do
not
know
them
and
their
possessors
wish
me
to
remain
in
ignorance
i
would
as
soon
think
of
stealing
their
purse
as
of
filching
their
secret
ah
thanks
said
garth
personally
i
do
not
mind
what
you
know
but
i
owe
it
to
her
that
her
name
should
not
appear
undoubtedly
said
the
doctor
except
in
so
far
as
she
herself
chooses
to
reveal
it
the
one
woman
identity
should
always
remain
a
secret
get
on
with
your
tale
old
chap
i
will
not
interrupt
i
will
state
it
as
simply
and
as
shortly
as
i
can
began
garth
and
you
will
understand
that
there
are
details
of
which
no
fellow
could
i
had
known
her
several
years
in
a
friendly
way
just
staying
at
the
same
houses
and
meeting
at
lord
and
henley
and
all
the
places
where
those
in
the
same
set
do
meet
i
always
liked
her
and
always
felt
at
my
best
with
her
and
thought
no
end
of
her
opinion
and
so
forth
she
was
a
friend
and
a
real
chum
to
me
and
to
lots
of
other
fellows
but
one
never
thought
of
in
connection
with
her
all
the
silly
things
one
says
to
ordinary
women
she
would
have
laughed
at
if
one
had
sent
her
flowers
to
wear
she
would
have
put
them
in
a
vase
and
wondered
for
whom
they
had
really
been
intended
she
danced
well
and
rode
straight
but
the
man
she
danced
with
had
to
be
awfully
good
at
it
or
he
found
himself
being
guided
through
the
giddy
maze
and
the
man
who
wanted
to
be
in
the
same
field
with
her
must
be
prepared
for
any
fence
or
any
wall
not
that
i
ever
saw
her
in
the
her
love
of
life
and
of
fair
play
would
have
kept
her
out
of
that
but
i
use
it
as
a
descriptive
illustration
one
was
always
glad
to
meet
her
in
a
house
party
though
one
could
not
have
explained
why
it
is
quite
impossible
to
describe
her
she
was
just
well
just
the
doctor
saw
just
jane
trembling
on
garth
lips
and
knew
how
inadequate
was
every
adjective
to
express
this
name
he
did
not
want
the
flood
of
garth
confidences
checked
so
he
supplied
the
needed
words
just
a
good
sort
yes
i
quite
understand
well
i
had
had
my
infatuations
plenty
of
them
went
on
the
eager
young
voice
the
one
thing
i
thought
of
in
women
was
their
exteriors
beauty
of
all
kinds
of
any
kind
crazed
me
for
the
moment
i
never
wanted
to
marry
them
but
i
always
wanted
to
paint
them
their
mothers
and
aunts
and
other
old
dowagers
in
the
house
parties
used
to
think
i
meant
marriage
but
the
girls
themselves
knew
better
i
do
believe
a
girl
now
walks
this
earth
who
would
accuse
me
of
flirting
i
admired
their
beauty
and
they
knew
it
and
they
knew
that
was
all
my
admiration
meant
it
was
a
pleasant
experience
at
the
time
and
in
several
instances
helped
forward
good
marriages
later
on
pauline
lister
was
apportioned
to
me
for
two
whole
seasons
but
she
eventually
married
the
man
on
whose
jolly
old
staircase
i
painted
her
why
i
come
a
cropper
over
any
of
them
because
there
were
too
many
i
suppose
also
the
attraction
was
i
do
mind
telling
you
quite
frankly
the
only
one
whose
beauty
used
to
cause
me
a
real
pang
was
lady
brand
but
when
i
had
painted
it
and
shown
it
to
the
world
in
its
perfection
i
was
content
i
asked
no
more
of
any
woman
than
to
paint
her
and
find
her
paintable
i
could
not
explain
this
to
the
husbands
and
mothers
and
chaperons
but
the
women
themselves
understood
it
well
enough
and
as
i
sit
here
in
my
darkness
not
a
memory
rises
up
to
reproach
me
good
boy
said
deryck
brand
laughing
you
were
vastly
misunderstood
but
i
believe
you
you
see
resumed
garth
that
sort
of
thing
being
merely
i
went
no
deeper
the
only
women
i
really
knew
were
my
mother
who
died
when
i
was
nineteen
and
margery
graem
whom
i
always
hugged
at
meeting
and
parting
and
always
shall
hug
until
i
kiss
the
old
face
in
its
coffin
or
she
straightens
me
in
mine
those
ties
of
one
infancy
and
boyhood
are
among
the
closest
and
most
sacred
life
can
show
well
so
things
were
until
a
certain
evening
in
june
several
years
ago
she
the
one
woman
and
i
were
in
the
same
house
party
at
a
lovely
old
place
in
the
country
one
afternoon
we
had
been
talking
intimately
but
quite
casually
and
frankly
i
had
no
more
thought
of
wanting
to
marry
her
than
of
proposing
to
old
margery
then
something
happened
i
must
not
tell
you
what
it
would
give
too
clear
a
clue
to
her
identity
but
it
revealed
to
me
in
a
few
marvellous
moments
the
woman
in
her
the
wife
the
mother
the
strength
the
tenderness
the
exquisite
perfection
of
her
true
pure
soul
in
five
minutes
there
awakened
in
me
a
hunger
for
her
which
nothing
could
still
which
nothing
ever
will
still
until
i
stand
beside
her
in
the
golden
city
where
they
shall
hunger
no
more
neither
thirst
any
more
and
there
shall
be
no
more
darkness
or
depending
upon
sun
moon
or
candle
for
the
glory
of
god
shall
lighten
it
and
there
shall
be
no
more
sorrow
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
former
things
shall
have
passed
away
the
blind
face
shone
in
the
firelight
garth
retrospection
was
bringing
him
visions
of
things
to
come
the
doctor
sat
quite
still
and
watched
the
vision
fade
then
he
said
well
well
continued
the
young
voice
in
the
shadow
with
a
sound
in
it
of
having
dropped
back
to
earth
and
finding
it
a
mournful
place
i
never
had
a
moment
doubt
as
to
what
had
happened
to
me
i
knew
i
loved
her
i
knew
i
wanted
her
i
knew
her
presence
made
my
day
and
her
absence
meant
chill
night
and
every
day
was
radiant
for
she
was
there
garth
paused
for
breath
and
to
enjoy
a
moment
of
silent
retrospection
the
doctor
voice
broke
in
with
a
question
clear
incisive
was
she
a
pretty
woman
handsome
beautiful
a
pretty
woman
repeated
garth
amazed
good
heavens
no
handsome
beautiful
well
you
have
me
there
for
my
honour
i
do
know
i
mean
would
you
have
wished
to
paint
her
i
have
painted
her
said
garth
very
low
a
moving
tenderness
in
his
voice
and
my
two
paintings
of
her
though
done
in
sadness
and
done
from
memory
are
the
most
beautiful
work
i
ever
produced
no
eye
but
my
own
has
ever
seen
them
and
now
none
ever
will
see
them
excepting
those
of
one
whom
i
must
perforce
trust
to
find
them
for
me
and
bring
them
to
me
for
destruction
and
that
will
be
queried
the
doctor
nurse
rosemary
gray
said
garth
the
doctor
kicked
the
pine
log
and
the
flames
darted
up
merrily
you
have
chosen
well
he
said
and
had
to
make
a
conscious
effort
to
keep
the
mirth
in
his
face
from
passing
into
his
voice
nurse
rosemary
will
be
discreet
very
good
then
we
may
take
it
the
one
woman
was
beautiful
but
garth
looked
perplexed
i
do
not
know
he
answered
slowly
i
can
not
see
her
through
the
eyes
of
others
my
vision
of
her
in
that
illuminating
moment
followed
the
inspired
order
of
things
spirit
soul
and
body
her
spirit
was
so
pure
and
perfect
her
soul
so
beautiful
noble
and
womanly
that
the
body
which
clothed
soul
and
spirit
partook
of
their
perfection
and
became
unutterably
dear
i
see
said
the
doctor
very
gently
yes
you
dear
fellow
i
see
oh
jane
jane
you
were
blind
without
a
bandage
in
those
days
several
glorious
days
went
by
continued
garth
i
realise
now
that
i
was
living
in
the
glow
of
my
own
certainty
that
she
was
the
one
woman
it
was
so
clear
and
sweet
and
wonderful
to
me
that
i
never
dreamed
of
it
not
being
equally
clear
to
her
we
did
a
lot
of
music
together
for
pure
enjoyment
we
talked
of
other
people
for
the
fun
of
it
we
enjoyed
and
appreciated
each
other
views
and
opinions
but
we
did
not
talk
of
ourselves
because
we
knew
at
least
knew
and
before
god
i
thought
she
did
every
time
i
saw
her
she
seemed
more
grand
and
perfect
i
held
the
golden
key
to
trifling
matters
not
understood
before
we
young
fellows
who
all
admired
her
used
nevertheless
to
joke
a
bit
about
her
wearing
collars
and
stocks
top
boots
and
short
skirts
whacking
her
leg
with
a
and
stirring
the
fire
with
her
toe
but
after
that
evening
i
understood
all
this
to
be
a
sort
of
fence
behind
which
she
hid
her
exquisite
womanliness
because
it
was
of
a
deeper
quality
than
any
man
looking
upon
the
mere
surface
of
her
had
ever
fathomed
or
understood
and
when
she
came
trailing
down
in
the
evening
in
something
rich
and
clinging
and
black
with
lots
of
soft
old
lace
covering
her
bosom
and
moving
with
the
beating
of
her
great
tender
heart
ah
then
my
soul
rejoiced
and
my
eyes
took
their
fill
of
delight
i
saw
her
as
all
day
long
i
had
known
her
to
be
perfect
in
her
proud
sweet
womanliness
is
he
really
unconscious
thought
the
doctor
of
how
unmistakable
a
of
jane
he
is
painting
very
soon
continued
garth
we
had
three
days
apart
and
then
met
again
at
another
house
in
a
weekend
party
one
of
the
beauties
was
there
with
whom
my
name
was
being
freely
coupled
and
something
she
said
on
that
subject
combined
with
the
fearful
blankness
of
those
three
interminable
days
made
me
resolve
to
speak
without
delay
i
asked
her
to
come
out
on
to
the
terrace
that
evening
we
were
alone
it
was
a
moonlight
night
a
long
silence
the
doctor
did
not
break
it
he
knew
his
friend
was
going
over
in
his
mind
all
those
things
of
which
a
man
does
not
speak
to
another
man
at
last
garth
said
simply
i
told
her
no
comment
from
the
doctor
who
was
vividly
reminded
of
then
it
happened
when
she
had
reached
this
point
in
the
story
after
a
few
moments
of
further
silence
steeped
in
the
silver
moonlight
of
reminiscence
for
garth
occupied
by
the
doctor
in
a
rapid
piecing
in
of
jane
version
the
sad
young
voice
continued
i
thought
she
understood
completely
afterwards
i
knew
she
had
not
understood
at
all
her
actions
led
me
to
believe
i
was
accepted
taken
into
her
great
love
even
as
she
was
wrapped
around
by
mine
not
through
fault
of
hers
ah
no
she
was
blameless
throughout
but
because
she
did
not
could
not
understand
what
any
touch
of
hers
must
mean
to
me
in
her
dear
life
there
had
never
been
another
man
that
much
i
knew
by
unerring
instinct
and
by
her
own
admission
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
she
may
have
had
an
ideal
in
her
girlish
days
against
whom
in
after
years
she
measured
others
and
finding
them
come
short
held
them
at
arm
length
but
if
i
am
right
in
this
surmise
he
must
have
been
a
blind
fool
unconscious
of
the
priceless
love
which
might
have
been
his
had
he
tried
to
win
it
for
i
am
certain
that
until
that
night
no
man
love
had
ever
flamed
about
her
she
had
never
felt
herself
enveloped
in
a
cry
which
was
all
one
passionate
inexplicable
boundless
need
of
herself
while
i
thought
she
understood
and
responded
heaven
knows
i
did
think
it
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
and
was
only
trying
to
be
sympathetic
and
kind
the
doctor
stirred
in
his
chair
slowly
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
looked
searchingly
into
the
blind
face
he
was
finding
these
confidences
of
the
other
man
more
trying
than
he
had
expected
are
you
sure
of
that
he
asked
rather
huskily
quite
sure
said
garth
listen
i
called
her
what
she
was
to
me
just
then
what
i
wanted
her
to
be
always
what
she
is
forever
so
far
as
my
part
goes
and
will
be
till
death
and
beyond
that
one
word
no
there
were
two
those
two
words
made
her
understand
i
see
that
now
she
rose
at
once
and
put
me
from
her
she
said
i
must
give
her
twelve
hours
for
quiet
thought
and
she
would
come
to
me
in
the
village
church
next
morning
with
her
answer
brand
you
may
think
me
a
fool
you
can
not
think
me
a
more
egregious
ass
than
i
now
think
myself
but
i
was
absolutely
certain
she
was
mine
so
sure
that
when
she
came
and
we
were
alone
together
in
the
house
of
god
instead
of
going
to
her
with
the
anxious
haste
of
suppliant
and
lover
i
called
her
to
me
at
the
chancel
step
as
if
i
were
indeed
her
husband
and
had
the
right
to
bid
her
come
she
came
and
just
as
a
sweet
formality
before
taking
her
to
me
i
asked
for
her
answer
it
was
this
can
not
marry
a
mere
boy
garth
voice
choked
in
his
throat
on
the
last
word
his
head
was
bowed
in
his
hands
he
had
reached
the
point
where
most
things
stopped
for
him
where
all
things
had
ceased
forever
to
be
as
they
were
before
the
room
seemed
strangely
silent
the
eager
voice
had
poured
out
into
it
such
a
flow
of
love
and
hope
and
longing
such
a
revealing
of
a
soul
in
which
the
true
love
of
beauty
had
created
perpetual
youth
of
a
heart
held
free
by
high
ideals
from
all
playing
with
lesser
loves
but
rising
to
volcanic
force
and
height
when
the
true
love
was
found
at
last
the
doctor
shivered
at
that
anticlimax
as
if
the
chill
of
an
empty
church
were
in
his
bones
he
knew
how
far
worse
it
had
been
than
garth
had
told
he
knew
of
the
cruel
humiliating
question
how
old
are
you
jane
had
confessed
to
it
he
knew
how
the
outward
glow
of
adoring
love
had
faded
as
the
mind
was
suddenly
turned
inward
to
he
had
known
it
all
as
abstract
fact
now
he
saw
it
actually
before
him
he
saw
jane
stricken
lover
bowed
beside
him
in
his
blindness
living
again
through
those
sights
and
sounds
which
no
merciful
curtain
of
oblivion
could
ever
hide
or
veil
the
doctor
had
his
faults
but
they
were
not
peter
he
never
under
any
circumstances
spoke
because
he
wist
not
what
to
say
he
leaned
forward
and
laid
a
hand
very
tenderly
on
garth
shoulder
poor
chap
he
said
ah
poor
old
chap
and
for
a
long
while
they
sat
thus
in
silence
chapter
xxv
the
doctor
diagnosis
so
you
expressed
no
opinion
explained
nothing
let
him
go
on
believing
that
oh
dicky
and
you
might
have
said
so
much
in
the
quiet
of
the
scotch
sabbath
morning
jane
and
the
doctor
had
climbed
the
winding
path
from
the
end
of
the
terrace
which
zigzagged
up
to
a
clearing
amongst
the
pines
two
fallen
trees
at
a
short
distance
from
each
other
provided
convenient
seats
in
full
sunshine
facing
a
glorious
view
down
into
the
glen
across
the
valley
and
away
to
the
purple
hills
beyond
the
doctor
had
guided
jane
to
the
sunnier
of
the
two
trunks
and
seated
himself
beside
her
then
he
had
quietly
recounted
practically
the
whole
of
the
conversation
of
the
previous
evening
i
expressed
no
opinion
i
explained
nothing
i
let
him
continue
to
believe
what
he
believes
because
it
is
the
only
way
to
keep
you
on
the
pinnacle
where
he
has
placed
you
let
any
other
reason
for
your
conduct
than
an
almost
infantine
ignorance
of
men
and
things
be
suggested
and
accepted
and
down
you
will
come
my
poor
jane
and
great
will
be
the
fall
mine
shall
not
be
the
hand
thus
to
hurl
you
headlong
as
you
say
i
might
have
said
so
much
but
i
might
also
have
lived
to
regret
it
i
should
fall
into
his
arms
said
jane
recklessly
and
i
would
sooner
be
there
than
on
a
pinnacle
excuse
me
my
good
girl
replied
the
doctor
it
is
more
likely
you
would
fall
into
the
first
express
going
south
in
fact
i
am
not
certain
you
would
wait
for
an
express
i
can
almost
see
the
honourable
jane
quitting
yonder
little
railway
station
seated
in
an
empty
no
do
start
up
and
attempt
to
stride
about
among
the
pine
needles
continued
the
doctor
pulling
jane
down
beside
him
again
you
will
only
trip
over
a
fir
cone
and
go
headlong
into
the
valley
it
is
no
use
forestalling
the
inevitable
fall
oh
dicky
sighed
jane
putting
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
leaning
her
bandaged
eyes
against
the
rough
tweed
of
his
shoulder
i
know
what
has
come
to
you
you
are
not
kind
to
me
you
have
harrowed
my
poor
soul
by
repeating
all
garth
said
last
night
and
thanks
to
that
terribly
good
memory
of
yours
you
have
reproduced
the
tones
of
his
voice
in
every
inflection
and
then
instead
of
comforting
me
you
leave
me
entirely
in
the
wrong
and
completely
in
the
lurch
in
the
wrong
yes
said
deryck
in
the
lurch
no
i
did
not
say
i
would
do
nothing
i
only
said
i
could
do
nothing
last
night
you
can
not
take
up
a
wounded
thing
and
turn
it
about
and
analyse
it
when
we
bade
each
other
i
told
him
i
would
think
the
matter
over
and
give
him
my
opinion
i
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
to
me
if
you
like
i
have
looked
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
a
very
rare
and
beautiful
nature
and
i
have
seen
what
havoc
a
woman
can
work
in
the
life
of
the
man
who
loves
her
i
can
assure
you
last
night
was
no
pastime
i
woke
this
morning
feeling
as
if
i
had
metaphorically
been
beaten
black
and
blue
then
what
do
you
suppose
feel
inquired
jane
pathetically
you
still
feel
yourself
in
the
right
partly
replied
deryck
and
so
long
as
you
think
you
have
a
particle
of
justification
and
cling
to
it
your
case
is
hopeless
it
will
have
to
be
confess
can
you
forgive
but
i
acted
for
the
best
said
jane
i
thought
of
him
before
i
thought
of
myself
it
would
have
been
far
easier
to
have
accepted
the
happiness
of
the
moment
and
chanced
the
future
that
is
not
honest
jeanette
you
thought
of
yourself
first
you
dared
not
face
the
possibility
of
the
pain
to
you
if
his
love
cooled
or
his
admiration
waned
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
i
believe
every
form
of
human
love
a
mother
only
excepted
is
primarily
selfish
the
best
chance
for
dalmain
is
that
his
helpless
blindness
may
awaken
the
mother
love
in
you
then
self
will
go
to
the
wall
ah
me
sighed
jane
i
am
lost
and
weary
and
perplexed
in
this
bewildering
darkness
nothing
seems
clear
nothing
seems
right
if
i
could
see
your
kind
eyes
boy
your
hard
voice
would
hurt
less
well
take
off
the
bandage
and
look
said
the
doctor
i
will
not
cried
jane
furiously
have
i
gone
through
all
this
to
fail
at
the
last
my
dear
girl
this
darkness
is
getting
on
your
nerves
take
care
it
does
not
do
more
harm
than
good
strong
remedies
hush
whispered
jane
i
hear
footsteps
you
can
always
hear
footsteps
in
a
wood
if
you
hearken
for
them
said
the
doctor
but
he
spoke
low
and
then
sat
quiet
listening
i
hear
garth
step
whispered
jane
oh
dicky
go
to
the
edge
and
look
over
you
can
see
the
windings
of
the
path
below
the
doctor
stepped
forward
quietly
and
looked
down
upon
the
way
they
had
ascended
then
he
came
back
to
jane
yes
he
said
fortune
favours
us
dalmain
is
coming
up
the
path
with
simpson
he
will
be
here
in
two
minutes
fortune
favours
us
my
dear
dicky
of
all
jane
hand
flew
to
her
bandage
but
the
doctor
stayed
her
just
in
time
not
at
all
he
said
and
do
not
fail
at
the
last
in
your
experiment
i
ought
to
be
able
to
keep
you
two
blind
people
apart
trust
me
and
keep
dark
i
mean
sit
still
and
can
you
not
understand
why
i
said
fortune
favours
us
dalmain
is
coming
for
my
opinion
on
the
case
you
shall
hear
it
together
it
will
be
a
saving
of
time
for
me
and
most
enlightening
for
you
to
mark
how
he
takes
it
now
keep
quiet
i
promise
he
shall
not
sit
on
your
lap
but
if
you
make
a
sound
i
shall
have
to
say
you
are
a
bunny
or
a
squirrel
and
throw
fir
cones
at
you
the
doctor
rose
and
sauntered
round
the
bend
of
the
path
jane
sat
on
in
darkness
hullo
dalmain
she
heard
deryck
say
found
your
way
up
here
an
ideal
spot
shall
we
dispense
with
simpson
take
my
arm
yes
replied
garth
i
was
told
you
were
up
here
brand
and
followed
you
they
came
round
the
bend
together
and
out
into
the
clearing
are
you
alone
asked
garth
standing
still
i
thought
i
heard
voices
you
did
replied
the
doctor
i
was
talking
to
a
young
woman
what
sort
of
young
woman
asked
garth
a
buxom
young
person
replied
the
doctor
with
a
decidedly
touchy
temper
do
you
know
her
name
jane
said
the
doctor
recklessly
not
said
garth
quickly
jean
i
know
her
my
eldest
daughter
rather
weighed
down
by
family
cares
poor
girl
i
saw
she
was
weighed
down
said
the
doctor
i
did
not
know
it
was
by
family
cares
let
us
sit
on
this
trunk
can
you
call
up
the
view
to
mind
yes
replied
garth
i
know
it
so
well
but
it
terrifies
me
to
find
how
my
mental
pictures
are
fading
all
but
one
and
that
is
asked
the
doctor
the
face
of
the
one
woman
said
garth
in
his
blindness
ah
my
dear
fellow
said
the
doctor
i
have
not
forgotten
my
promise
to
give
you
this
morning
my
opinion
on
your
story
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
carefully
and
have
arrived
at
several
conclusions
shall
we
sit
on
this
fallen
tree
wo
you
smoke
one
can
talk
better
under
the
influence
of
the
fragrant
weed
garth
took
out
his
cigarette
case
chose
a
cigarette
lighted
it
with
care
and
flung
the
flaming
match
straight
on
to
jane
clasped
hands
before
the
doctor
could
spring
up
jane
had
smilingly
flicked
it
off
what
nerve
thought
deryck
with
admiration
women
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
said
and
given
away
the
show
really
she
deserves
to
win
suddenly
garth
stood
up
i
think
we
shall
do
better
on
the
other
log
he
said
unexpectedly
it
is
always
in
fuller
sunshine
and
he
moved
towards
jane
with
a
bound
the
doctor
sprang
in
front
of
him
seized
jane
with
one
strong
hand
and
drew
her
behind
him
then
guided
garth
to
the
very
spot
where
she
had
been
sitting
how
accurately
you
judge
distance
he
remarked
backing
with
jane
towards
the
further
trunk
then
he
seated
himself
beside
garth
in
the
sunshine
now
for
our
talk
said
the
doctor
and
he
said
it
rather
breathlessly
are
you
sure
we
are
alone
asked
garth
i
seem
conscious
of
another
presence
my
dear
fellow
said
the
doctor
is
one
ever
alone
in
a
wood
countless
little
presences
surround
us
bright
eyes
peep
down
from
the
branches
furry
tails
flick
in
and
out
of
holes
things
unseen
move
in
the
dead
leaves
at
our
feet
if
you
seek
solitude
shun
the
woods
yes
replied
garth
i
know
and
i
love
listening
to
them
i
meant
a
human
presence
brand
i
am
often
so
tried
by
the
sense
of
an
unseen
human
presence
near
me
do
you
know
i
could
have
sworn
the
other
day
that
she
the
one
woman
came
silently
looked
upon
me
in
my
blindness
pitied
me
as
her
great
tender
heart
would
do
and
silently
departed
when
was
that
asked
the
doctor
a
few
days
ago
dr
rob
had
been
telling
us
how
he
came
across
her
in
ah
i
must
not
say
where
then
he
and
miss
gray
left
me
alone
and
in
the
lonely
darkness
and
silence
i
felt
her
eyes
upon
me
dear
boy
said
the
doctor
you
must
not
encourage
this
dread
of
unseen
presences
remember
those
who
care
for
us
very
truly
and
deeply
can
often
make
us
conscious
of
their
mental
nearness
even
when
far
away
especially
if
they
know
we
are
in
trouble
and
needing
them
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
you
are
often
conscious
of
the
nearness
of
the
one
woman
for
i
believe
and
i
do
not
say
it
lightly
dalmain
i
believe
her
whole
heart
and
love
and
life
are
yours
good
lord
exclaimed
garth
and
springing
up
strode
forward
aimlessly
the
doctor
caught
him
by
the
arm
in
another
moment
he
would
have
fallen
over
jane
feet
sit
down
man
said
the
doctor
and
listen
to
me
you
gain
nothing
by
dashing
about
in
the
dark
in
that
way
i
am
going
to
prove
my
words
but
you
must
give
me
your
calm
attention
now
listen
we
are
confronted
in
this
case
by
a
psychological
problem
and
one
which
very
likely
has
not
occurred
to
you
i
want
you
for
a
moment
to
picture
the
one
man
and
the
one
woman
facing
each
other
in
the
garden
of
eden
or
in
the
moonlight
wherever
it
was
if
you
like
better
now
will
you
realise
this
the
effect
upon
a
man
of
falling
in
love
is
to
create
in
him
a
complete
unconsciousness
of
self
on
the
other
hand
the
effect
upon
a
woman
of
being
loved
and
sought
and
of
responding
to
that
love
and
seeking
is
an
accession
of
intense
he
longing
to
win
and
take
thinks
of
her
only
she
called
upon
to
yield
and
give
has
her
mind
turned
at
once
upon
herself
can
she
meet
his
need
is
she
all
he
thinks
her
will
she
be
able
to
content
him
completely
not
only
now
but
in
the
long
vista
of
years
to
come
the
more
natural
and
unconscious
of
self
she
had
been
before
the
harder
she
would
be
hit
by
this
sudden
overwhelming
attack
of
the
doctor
glanced
at
jane
on
the
log
six
yards
away
she
had
lifted
her
clasped
hands
and
was
nodding
towards
him
her
face
radiant
with
relief
and
thankfulness
he
felt
he
was
on
the
right
tack
but
the
blind
face
beside
him
clouded
heavily
and
the
cloud
deepened
as
he
proceeded
you
see
my
dear
chap
i
gathered
from
yourself
she
was
not
of
the
type
of
feminine
loveliness
you
were
known
to
admire
might
she
not
have
feared
that
her
appearance
would
after
a
while
have
failed
to
content
you
no
replied
garth
with
absolutely
finality
of
tone
such
a
suggestion
is
unworthy
besides
had
the
idea
by
any
possibility
entered
her
mind
she
would
only
have
had
to
question
me
on
the
point
my
decision
would
have
been
final
my
answer
would
have
fully
reassured
her
love
is
blind
quoted
the
doctor
quietly
they
lie
who
say
so
cried
garth
violently
love
is
so
that
it
sees
beneath
the
surface
and
delights
in
beauties
unseen
by
other
eyes
then
you
do
not
accept
my
theory
asked
the
doctor
not
as
an
explanation
of
my
own
trouble
answered
garth
because
i
know
the
greatness
of
her
nature
would
have
lifted
her
far
above
such
a
consideration
but
i
do
indeed
agree
as
to
the
complete
oblivion
to
self
of
the
man
in
love
how
else
could
we
ever
venture
to
suggest
to
a
woman
that
she
should
marry
us
ah
brand
when
one
thinks
of
it
the
intrusion
into
her
privacy
the
asking
the
right
to
touch
even
her
hand
at
will
it
could
not
be
done
unless
the
love
of
her
and
the
thought
of
her
had
swept
away
all
thoughts
of
self
looking
back
upon
that
time
i
remember
how
completely
it
was
so
with
me
and
when
she
said
to
me
in
the
church
old
are
you
ah
i
did
not
tell
you
that
last
night
the
revulsion
of
feeling
brought
about
by
being
turned
at
that
moment
in
upon
myself
was
so
great
that
my
joy
seemed
to
shrivel
and
die
in
horror
at
my
own
unworthiness
silence
in
the
wood
the
doctor
felt
he
was
playing
a
losing
game
he
dared
not
look
at
the
silent
figure
opposite
at
last
he
spoke
dalmain
there
are
two
possible
solutions
to
your
problem
do
you
think
it
was
a
case
of
eve
holding
back
in
virginal
shyness
expecting
adam
to
pursue
ah
no
said
garth
emphatically
we
had
gone
far
beyond
all
that
nor
could
you
suggest
it
did
you
know
her
she
is
too
honest
too
absolutely
straight
and
true
to
have
deceived
me
besides
had
it
been
so
in
all
these
lonely
years
when
she
found
i
made
no
sign
she
would
have
sent
me
word
of
what
she
really
meant
should
you
have
gone
to
her
then
asked
the
doctor
yes
said
garth
slowly
i
should
have
gone
and
i
should
have
forgiven
because
she
is
my
own
but
it
could
never
have
been
the
same
it
would
have
been
unworthy
of
us
both
well
continued
the
doctor
the
other
solution
remains
you
have
admitted
that
the
one
woman
came
somewhat
short
of
the
conventional
standard
of
beauty
your
love
of
loveliness
was
so
well
known
do
you
not
think
during
the
long
hours
of
that
night
remember
how
new
it
was
to
her
to
be
so
worshipped
and
wanted
do
you
not
think
her
courage
failed
her
she
feared
she
might
come
short
of
what
eventually
you
would
need
in
the
face
and
figure
always
opposite
you
at
your
table
and
despite
her
own
great
love
and
yours
she
thought
it
wisest
to
avoid
future
disillusion
by
rejecting
present
joy
her
very
love
for
you
would
have
armed
her
to
this
decision
the
silent
figure
opposite
nodded
and
waited
with
clasped
hands
deryck
was
pleading
her
cause
better
than
she
could
have
pleaded
it
herself
silence
in
the
woods
all
nature
seemed
to
hush
and
listen
for
the
answer
then
no
said
garth
young
voice
unhesitatingly
in
that
case
she
would
have
told
me
her
fear
and
i
should
have
reassured
her
immediately
your
suggestion
is
unworthy
of
my
beloved
the
wind
sighed
in
the
trees
a
cloud
passed
before
the
sun
the
two
who
sat
in
darkness
shivered
and
were
silent
then
the
doctor
spoke
my
dear
boy
he
said
and
a
deep
tenderness
was
in
his
voice
i
must
maintain
my
unalterable
belief
that
to
the
one
woman
you
are
still
the
one
man
in
your
blindness
her
rightful
place
is
by
your
side
perhaps
even
now
she
is
yearning
to
be
here
will
you
tell
me
her
name
and
give
me
leave
to
seek
her
out
hear
from
herself
her
version
of
the
story
and
if
it
be
as
i
think
bring
her
to
you
to
prove
in
your
affliction
her
love
and
tenderness
never
said
garth
never
while
life
shall
last
can
you
not
see
that
if
when
i
had
sight
and
fame
and
all
heart
could
desire
i
could
not
win
her
love
what
she
might
feel
for
me
now
in
my
helpless
blindness
could
be
but
pity
and
pity
from
her
i
could
never
accept
if
i
was
mere
boy
three
years
ago
i
am
mere
blind
man
now
an
object
for
kind
commiseration
if
indeed
you
are
right
and
she
mistrusted
my
love
and
my
fidelity
it
is
now
out
of
my
power
forever
to
prove
her
wrong
and
to
prove
myself
faithful
but
i
will
not
allow
the
vision
of
my
beloved
to
be
dimmed
by
these
suggestions
for
her
completion
she
needed
so
much
more
than
i
could
give
she
refused
me
because
i
was
not
fully
worthy
i
prefer
it
should
be
so
let
us
leave
it
at
that
it
leaves
you
to
loneliness
said
the
doctor
sadly
i
prefer
loneliness
replied
garth
young
voice
to
disillusion
hark
i
hear
the
first
gong
brand
margery
will
be
grieved
if
we
keep
her
sunday
dishes
waiting
he
stood
up
and
turned
his
sightless
face
towards
the
view
ah
how
well
i
know
it
he
said
when
miss
gray
and
i
sit
up
here
she
tells
me
all
she
sees
and
i
tell
her
what
she
does
not
see
but
what
i
know
is
there
she
is
keen
on
art
and
on
most
of
the
things
i
care
about
i
must
ask
for
an
arm
brand
though
the
path
is
wide
and
good
i
can
not
risk
a
tumble
i
have
come
one
or
two
awful
croppers
and
i
promised
miss
gray
the
path
is
wide
yes
we
can
walk
two
abreast
three
abreast
if
necessary
it
is
well
we
had
this
good
path
made
it
used
to
be
a
steep
scramble
three
abreast
said
the
doctor
so
we
could
if
necessary
he
stepped
back
and
raised
jane
from
her
seat
drawing
her
cold
hand
through
his
left
arm
now
my
dear
fellow
my
right
arm
will
suit
you
best
then
you
can
keep
your
stick
in
your
right
hand
and
thus
they
started
down
through
the
wood
on
that
lovely
sabbath
morn
of
early
summer
and
the
doctor
walked
erect
between
those
two
severed
hearts
uniting
and
yet
dividing
them
just
once
garth
paused
and
listened
i
seem
to
hear
another
footstep
he
said
besides
yours
and
mine
the
wood
is
full
of
footsteps
said
the
doctor
just
as
the
heart
is
full
of
echoes
if
you
stand
still
and
listen
you
can
hear
what
you
will
in
either
then
let
us
not
stand
still
said
garth
for
in
old
days
if
i
was
late
for
lunch
margery
used
to
spank
me
chapter
xxvi
hearts
meet
in
sightless
land
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
miss
gray
for
me
ever
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
this
that
you
have
done
for
my
sake
garth
stood
at
the
open
library
window
the
morning
sunlight
poured
into
the
room
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
flowers
resonant
with
the
songs
of
birds
as
he
stood
there
in
the
sunshine
a
new
look
of
strength
and
hopefulness
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
his
erect
figure
he
held
out
eager
hands
towards
nurse
rosemary
but
more
as
an
expression
of
the
outgoing
of
his
appreciation
and
gratitude
than
with
any
expectation
of
responsive
hands
being
placed
within
them
and
here
was
i
picturing
you
having
a
gay
weekend
and
wondering
where
and
who
your
friends
in
this
neighbourhood
could
be
and
all
the
while
you
were
sitting
blindfold
in
the
room
over
my
head
ah
the
goodness
of
it
is
beyond
words
but
did
you
not
feel
somewhat
of
a
deceiver
miss
gray
she
always
felt
that
poor
jane
so
she
readily
answered
yes
and
yet
i
told
you
i
was
not
going
far
and
my
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
were
simpson
and
margery
who
aided
and
abetted
and
it
was
true
to
say
i
was
going
for
was
i
not
going
into
darkness
and
it
is
a
different
world
from
the
land
of
light
ah
how
true
that
is
cried
garth
and
how
difficult
to
make
people
understand
the
loneliness
of
it
and
how
they
seem
suddenly
to
arrive
close
to
one
from
another
world
stooping
from
some
distant
planet
with
sympathetic
voice
and
friendly
touch
and
then
away
they
go
to
another
sphere
leaving
one
to
the
immensity
of
solitude
in
sightless
land
yes
agreed
nurse
rosemary
and
you
almost
dread
the
coming
because
the
going
makes
the
darkness
darker
and
the
loneliness
more
lonely
ah
so
you
experienced
that
said
garth
do
you
know
now
you
have
in
sightless
land
i
shall
not
feel
it
such
a
place
of
solitude
at
every
turn
i
shall
be
able
to
say
dear
and
faithful
friend
has
been
here
he
laughed
a
laugh
of
such
almost
boyish
pleasure
that
all
the
mother
in
jane
love
rose
up
and
demanded
of
her
one
supreme
effort
she
looked
at
the
slight
figure
in
white
flannels
leaning
against
the
window
frame
so
manly
so
beautiful
still
and
yet
so
helpless
and
so
needing
the
wealth
of
tenderness
which
was
hers
to
give
then
standing
facing
him
she
opened
her
arms
as
if
the
great
preparedness
of
that
place
of
rest
so
close
to
him
must
draw
him
to
her
and
standing
thus
in
the
sunlight
jane
spoke
was
she
beautiful
was
she
paintable
would
a
man
grow
weary
of
such
a
look
turned
on
him
of
such
arms
held
out
alas
too
late
on
that
point
no
lover
shall
ever
be
able
to
pass
judgment
that
look
is
for
one
man
alone
he
only
will
ever
bring
it
to
that
loving
face
and
he
can
not
pronounce
upon
its
beauty
in
voice
of
rapturous
content
he
can
not
judge
he
can
not
see
he
is
blind
dalmain
there
are
many
smaller
details
but
before
we
talk
of
those
i
want
to
tell
you
the
greatest
of
all
the
lessons
i
learned
in
sightless
land
then
conscious
that
her
emotion
was
producing
in
her
voice
a
resonant
depth
which
might
remind
him
too
vividly
of
notes
in
the
rosary
she
paused
and
resumed
in
the
high
soft
edition
of
her
own
voice
which
it
had
become
second
nature
to
her
to
use
as
nurse
rosemary
dalmain
it
seems
to
me
i
learned
to
understand
how
that
which
is
loneliness
unspeakable
to
one
might
be
paradise
of
a
very
perfect
kind
for
two
i
realised
that
there
might
be
circumstances
in
which
the
dark
would
become
a
very
wonderful
for
souls
if
i
loved
a
man
who
lost
his
sight
i
should
be
glad
to
have
mine
in
order
to
be
eyes
for
him
when
eyes
were
needed
just
as
were
i
rich
and
he
poor
i
should
value
my
money
simply
as
a
thing
which
might
be
useful
to
him
but
i
know
the
daylight
would
often
be
a
trial
to
me
because
it
would
be
something
he
could
not
share
and
when
evening
came
i
should
long
to
say
us
put
out
the
lights
and
shut
away
the
moonlight
and
sit
together
in
the
sweet
soft
darkness
which
is
more
uniting
than
the
light
while
jane
was
speaking
garth
paled
as
he
listened
and
his
face
grew
strangely
set
then
as
if
under
a
reaction
of
feeling
a
boyish
flush
spread
to
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
he
visibly
shrank
from
the
voice
which
was
saying
these
things
to
him
he
fumbled
with
his
right
hand
for
the
orange
cord
which
would
guide
him
to
his
chair
nurse
rosemary
he
said
and
at
the
tone
of
his
voice
outstretched
arms
dropped
to
her
sides
it
is
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
all
these
beautiful
thoughts
which
came
to
you
in
the
darkness
but
i
hope
the
man
who
is
happy
enough
to
possess
your
love
or
who
is
going
to
be
fortunate
enough
to
win
it
will
neither
be
so
unhappy
nor
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
his
sight
it
will
be
better
for
him
to
live
with
you
in
the
light
than
to
be
called
upon
to
prove
the
kind
way
in
which
you
would
be
willing
to
adapt
yourself
to
his
darkness
how
about
opening
our
letters
he
slipped
his
hand
along
the
orange
cord
and
walked
over
to
his
chair
then
with
a
sense
of
unutterable
dismay
jane
saw
what
she
had
done
she
had
completely
forgotten
nurse
rosemary
using
her
only
as
a
means
of
awakening
in
garth
an
understanding
of
how
much
her
jane
love
might
mean
to
him
in
his
blindness
she
had
forgotten
that
to
garth
nurse
rosemary
was
the
only
personality
which
counted
in
this
conversation
she
who
had
just
given
him
such
a
proof
of
her
interest
and
devotion
and
o
poor
dear
garth
o
bold
brazen
nurse
rosemary
he
very
naturally
concluded
she
was
making
love
to
him
jane
felt
herself
between
scylla
and
charybdis
and
she
took
a
very
prompt
and
characteristic
plunge
she
came
across
to
her
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
table
and
sat
down
i
believe
it
was
the
thought
of
him
made
me
realise
this
she
said
but
just
now
i
and
my
young
man
have
fallen
out
he
does
not
even
know
i
am
here
garth
unbent
at
once
and
again
that
boyish
heightening
of
colour
indicated
his
sense
of
shame
at
what
he
had
imagined
ah
miss
gray
he
said
eagerly
you
will
not
think
it
impertinent
or
intrusive
on
my
part
but
do
you
know
i
have
wondered
sometimes
whether
there
was
a
happy
man
nurse
rosemary
laughed
well
we
ca
call
him
a
happy
man
just
now
she
said
so
far
as
his
thoughts
of
me
are
concerned
my
whole
heart
is
his
if
he
could
only
be
brought
to
believe
it
but
a
misunderstanding
has
grown
up
between
us
my
fault
entirely
and
he
will
not
allow
me
to
put
it
right
what
a
fool
cried
garth
are
you
and
he
engaged
nurse
rosemary
hesitated
well
not
exactly
engaged
she
said
though
it
practically
amounts
to
that
neither
of
us
would
give
a
thought
to
any
one
else
garth
knew
there
was
a
class
of
people
whose
preliminary
step
to
marriage
was
called
keeping
company
a
stage
above
the
walking
out
both
expressions
being
exactly
descriptive
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
for
whereas
pretty
phyllis
and
her
swain
go
walking
out
of
an
evening
in
byways
and
between
hedges
or
along
pavements
and
into
the
parks
these
keep
each
other
company
in
the
parlours
and
arbours
of
their
respective
friends
and
relations
yet
somehow
garth
had
never
thought
of
nurse
rosemary
as
belonging
to
any
other
class
than
his
own
perhaps
this
ass
of
a
fellow
whom
he
already
cordially
disliked
came
of
a
lower
stratum
or
perhaps
the
rules
of
her
nursing
guild
forbade
a
definite
engagement
but
allowed
an
understanding
anyway
the
fact
remained
that
the
clever
delightful
little
lady
who
had
done
so
much
for
him
had
a
young
man
of
her
own
and
this
admitted
fact
lifted
a
weight
from
garth
mind
he
had
been
so
afraid
lately
of
not
being
quite
honest
with
her
and
with
himself
she
had
become
so
necessary
to
him
nay
so
essential
and
by
her
skill
and
devotion
had
won
so
deep
a
place
in
his
gratitude
their
relation
was
of
so
intimate
a
nature
their
companionship
so
close
and
continuous
and
into
this
rather
ideal
state
of
things
had
heavily
trodden
dr
rob
the
other
day
with
a
suggestion
garth
alone
with
him
bad
been
explaining
how
indispensable
miss
gray
had
become
to
his
happiness
and
comfort
and
how
much
he
dreaded
a
recall
from
her
matron
i
fear
they
do
not
let
them
go
on
indefinitely
at
one
case
but
perhaps
sir
deryck
can
arrange
that
this
should
be
an
exception
said
garth
oh
hang
the
matron
and
blow
sir
deryck
said
dr
rob
breezily
if
you
want
her
as
a
permanency
make
sure
of
her
marry
her
my
boy
warrant
she
have
you
thus
trod
dr
rob
with
heavily
nailed
boots
upon
the
bare
toes
of
a
delicate
situation
garth
tried
to
put
the
suggestion
out
of
his
mind
and
failed
he
began
to
notice
thoughts
and
plans
of
nurse
rosemary
for
his
benefit
which
so
far
exceeded
her
professional
duties
that
it
seemed
as
if
there
must
be
behind
them
the
promptings
of
a
more
tender
interest
he
put
the
thought
away
again
and
again
calling
dr
rob
an
old
fool
and
himself
a
conceited
ass
but
again
and
again
there
came
about
him
with
nurse
rosemary
presence
the
subtile
surrounding
atmosphere
of
a
watchful
love
then
one
night
he
faced
and
fought
a
great
temptation
after
all
why
should
he
not
do
as
dr
rob
suggested
why
not
marry
this
charming
capable
devoted
nurse
and
have
her
constantly
about
him
in
his
blindness
she
did
not
consider
him
a
mere
boy
what
had
he
to
offer
her
a
beautiful
home
every
luxury
abundant
wealth
a
companionship
she
seemed
to
find
congenial
but
then
the
tempter
overreached
himself
for
he
whispered
and
the
voice
would
be
always
jane
you
have
never
seen
the
nurse
face
you
never
will
see
it
you
can
go
on
putting
to
the
voice
the
face
and
form
you
adore
you
can
marry
the
little
nurse
and
go
on
loving
jane
then
garth
cried
out
in
horror
avaunt
satan
and
the
battle
was
won
but
it
troubled
his
mind
lest
by
any
chance
her
peace
of
heart
should
be
disturbed
through
him
so
it
was
with
relief
and
yet
with
an
unreasonable
smouldering
jealousy
that
he
heard
of
the
young
man
to
whom
she
was
devoted
and
now
it
appeared
she
was
unhappy
through
her
young
man
just
as
he
was
unhappy
through
no
because
of
jane
a
sudden
impulse
came
over
him
to
do
away
forever
with
the
thought
which
in
his
own
mind
had
lately
come
between
them
and
to
establish
their
intimacy
on
an
even
closer
and
firmer
basis
by
being
absolutely
frank
with
her
on
the
matter
miss
gray
he
said
leaning
towards
her
with
that
delightful
smile
of
boyish
candour
which
many
women
had
found
irresistible
it
is
good
of
you
to
have
told
me
about
yourself
and
although
i
confess
to
feeling
unreasonably
jealous
of
the
fortunate
fellow
who
possesses
your
whole
heart
i
am
glad
he
exists
because
we
all
miss
something
unless
we
have
in
our
lives
the
wonderful
experience
of
the
one
woman
or
the
one
man
and
i
want
to
tell
you
something
dear
sweet
friend
of
mine
which
closely
touches
you
and
me
only
before
i
do
so
put
your
hand
in
mine
that
i
may
realise
you
in
a
closer
intimacy
than
heretofore
you
who
have
been
in
sightless
land
know
how
much
a
hand
clasp
means
down
here
garth
stretched
his
hand
across
the
table
and
his
whole
attitude
was
tense
with
expectation
i
can
not
do
that
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
in
a
voice
which
shook
a
little
i
have
burned
my
hands
oh
not
seriously
do
not
look
so
distressed
just
a
lighted
match
yes
while
i
was
blind
now
tell
me
the
thing
which
touches
you
and
me
garth
withdrew
his
hand
and
clasped
both
around
his
knee
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
face
turned
upwards
there
was
upon
it
an
expression
so
pure
the
exaltation
of
a
spirit
so
lifted
above
the
temptations
of
the
lower
nature
that
jane
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
looked
at
him
she
realised
what
his
love
for
her
supplemented
by
the
discipline
of
suffering
had
done
for
her
lover
he
began
to
speak
softly
not
turning
towards
her
tell
me
he
said
is
he
very
much
to
you
jane
eyes
could
not
leave
the
dear
face
and
figure
in
the
chair
jane
emotion
trembled
in
nurse
rosemary
voice
he
is
all
the
world
to
me
she
said
does
he
love
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
jane
bent
and
laid
her
lips
on
the
table
where
his
outstretched
hand
had
rested
then
nurse
rosemary
answered
he
loved
me
far
far
more
than
i
ever
deserved
why
do
you
say
is
not
the
truer
tense
alas
no
said
nurse
rosemary
brokenly
for
i
fear
i
have
lost
his
love
by
my
own
mistrust
of
it
and
my
own
never
said
garth
never
faileth
it
may
for
a
time
appear
to
be
dead
even
buried
but
the
easter
morn
soon
dawns
and
lo
love
ariseth
love
grieved
is
like
a
bird
with
wet
wings
it
can
not
fly
it
can
not
rise
it
hops
about
upon
the
ground
chirping
anxiously
but
every
flutter
shakes
away
more
drops
every
moment
in
the
sunshine
is
drying
the
tiny
feathers
and
very
soon
it
soars
to
the
tree
top
all
the
better
for
the
bath
which
seemed
to
have
robbed
it
of
the
power
to
rise
ah
if
my
beloved
could
but
dry
his
wings
murmured
nurse
rosemary
but
i
fear
i
did
more
than
wet
them
i
clipped
them
worse
still
i
broke
them
does
he
know
you
feel
yourself
so
in
the
wrong
garth
asked
the
question
very
gently
no
replied
nurse
rosemary
he
will
give
me
no
chance
to
explain
and
no
opportunity
to
tell
him
how
he
wrongs
himself
and
me
by
the
view
he
now
takes
of
my
conduct
poor
girl
said
garth
in
tones
of
sympathy
and
comprehension
my
own
experience
has
been
such
a
tragedy
that
i
can
feel
for
those
whose
course
of
true
love
does
not
run
smooth
but
take
my
advice
miss
gray
write
him
a
full
confession
keep
nothing
back
tell
him
just
how
it
all
happened
any
man
who
truly
loves
would
believe
accept
your
explanation
and
be
thankful
only
i
hope
he
would
not
come
tearing
up
here
and
take
you
away
from
me
jane
smiled
through
a
mist
of
tears
if
he
wanted
me
dalmain
i
should
have
to
go
to
him
said
nurse
rosemary
how
i
dread
the
day
continued
garth
when
you
will
come
and
say
to
me
have
to
go
and
do
you
know
i
have
sometimes
thought
you
have
done
so
much
for
me
and
become
so
much
to
me
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
can
tell
you
frankly
now
it
might
have
seemed
as
if
there
were
a
very
obvious
way
to
try
to
keep
you
always
you
are
so
immensely
worthy
of
all
a
man
could
offer
of
all
the
devotion
a
man
could
give
and
because
to
one
so
worthy
i
never
could
have
offered
less
than
the
best
i
want
to
tell
you
that
in
my
heart
i
hold
shrined
forever
one
beloved
face
all
others
are
gradually
fading
now
in
my
blindness
i
can
hardly
recall
clearly
the
many
lovely
faces
i
have
painted
and
admired
all
are
more
or
less
blurred
and
indistinct
but
this
one
face
grows
clearer
thank
god
as
the
darkness
deepens
it
will
be
with
me
through
life
i
shall
see
it
in
death
the
face
of
the
woman
i
love
you
said
of
your
lover
hesitating
to
be
sure
of
his
present
state
of
heart
i
can
neither
say
nor
of
my
beloved
she
never
loved
me
but
i
love
her
with
a
love
which
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
have
any
to
offer
to
another
woman
if
i
could
bring
myself
from
unworthy
motives
and
selfish
desires
to
ask
another
to
wed
me
i
should
do
her
an
untold
wrong
for
her
unseen
face
would
be
nothing
to
me
always
that
one
and
only
face
would
be
shining
in
my
darkness
her
voice
would
be
dear
only
in
so
far
as
it
reminded
me
of
the
voice
of
the
woman
i
love
dear
friend
if
you
ever
pray
for
me
pray
that
i
may
never
be
so
base
as
to
offer
to
any
woman
such
a
husk
as
marriage
with
me
would
mean
but
said
nurse
rosemary
she
she
who
has
made
it
a
husk
for
others
she
who
might
have
the
finest
of
the
wheat
the
full
corn
in
the
ear
herself
she
said
garth
has
refused
it
it
was
neither
fine
enough
nor
full
enough
it
was
not
worthy
o
my
god
little
girl
what
it
means
to
appear
inadequate
to
the
woman
one
loves
garth
dropped
his
face
between
his
hands
with
a
groan
silence
unbroken
reigned
in
the
library
suddenly
garth
began
to
speak
low
and
quickly
without
lifting
his
head
now
he
said
now
i
feel
it
just
as
i
told
brand
and
never
so
clearly
before
excepting
once
when
i
was
alone
ah
miss
gray
move
do
stir
but
look
all
round
the
room
and
tell
me
whether
you
see
anything
look
at
the
window
look
at
the
door
lean
forward
and
look
behind
the
screen
i
can
not
believe
we
are
alone
i
will
not
believe
it
i
am
being
deceived
in
my
blindness
and
yet
i
am
not
deceived
i
am
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
woman
i
love
her
eyes
are
fixed
upon
me
in
pity
sorrow
and
compassion
her
grief
at
my
woe
is
so
great
that
it
almost
enfolds
me
as
i
had
dreamed
her
love
would
do
o
my
god
she
is
so
near
and
it
is
so
terrible
because
i
do
not
wish
her
near
i
would
sooner
a
thousand
miles
were
between
us
and
i
am
certain
there
are
not
many
yards
is
it
psychic
or
is
it
actual
or
am
i
going
mad
miss
gray
you
would
not
lie
to
me
no
persuasion
or
bribery
or
confounded
chicanery
could
induce
you
to
deceive
me
on
this
point
look
around
for
god
sake
and
tell
me
are
we
alone
and
if
not
who
is
in
the
room
besides
you
and
me
jane
had
been
sitting
with
her
arms
folded
upon
the
table
her
yearning
eyes
fixed
upon
garth
bowed
head
when
he
wished
her
a
thousand
miles
away
she
buried
her
face
upon
them
she
was
so
near
him
that
had
garth
stretched
out
his
right
hand
again
it
would
have
touched
the
heavy
coils
of
her
soft
hair
but
garth
did
not
raise
his
head
and
jane
still
sat
with
her
face
buried
there
was
silence
in
the
library
for
a
few
moments
after
question
and
appeal
then
jane
lifted
her
face
there
is
no
one
in
the
room
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
but
you
and
me
chapter
xxvii
the
eyes
garth
trusted
so
you
enjoy
motoring
miss
gray
they
had
been
out
in
the
motor
together
for
the
first
time
and
were
now
having
tea
together
in
the
library
also
for
the
first
time
and
for
the
first
time
nurse
rosemary
was
pouring
out
for
her
patient
this
was
only
monday
afternoon
and
already
her
experience
had
won
for
her
many
new
privileges
yes
i
like
it
dalmain
particularly
in
this
beautiful
air
have
you
had
a
case
before
in
a
house
where
they
kept
a
motor
nurse
rosemary
hesitated
yes
i
have
stayed
in
houses
where
they
had
motors
and
i
have
been
in
dr
brand
he
met
me
at
charing
cross
once
with
his
electric
brougham
ah
i
know
said
garth
very
neat
on
your
way
to
a
case
or
returning
from
a
case
nurse
rosemary
smiled
then
bit
her
lip
to
a
case
she
replied
quite
gravely
i
was
on
my
way
to
his
house
to
talk
it
over
and
receive
instructions
it
must
be
splendid
working
under
such
a
fellow
as
brand
said
garth
and
yet
i
am
certain
most
of
the
best
things
you
do
are
quite
your
own
idea
for
instance
he
did
not
suggest
your
plan
did
he
i
thought
not
ah
the
difference
it
has
made
now
tell
me
when
we
were
motoring
we
never
slowed
up
suddenly
to
pass
anything
or
tooted
to
make
something
move
out
of
the
way
without
your
having
already
told
me
what
we
were
going
to
pass
or
what
was
in
the
road
a
little
way
ahead
it
was
shall
be
passing
a
hay
cart
at
the
next
bend
there
will
be
just
room
but
we
shall
have
to
slow
up
or
old
red
cow
is
in
the
very
middle
of
the
road
a
little
way
on
i
think
she
will
move
if
we
hoot
then
when
the
sudden
slow
down
and
swerve
came
or
the
toot
toot
of
the
horn
i
knew
all
about
it
and
was
not
taken
unawares
did
you
know
how
trying
it
is
in
blindness
to
be
speeding
along
and
suddenly
alter
pace
without
having
any
idea
why
or
swerve
to
one
side
and
not
know
what
one
has
just
been
avoiding
this
afternoon
our
spin
was
pure
pleasure
because
not
once
did
you
let
these
things
happen
i
knew
all
that
was
taking
place
as
soon
as
i
should
have
known
it
had
i
had
my
sight
jane
pressed
her
hand
over
her
bosom
ah
how
able
she
was
always
to
fill
her
boy
life
with
pure
pleasure
how
little
of
the
needless
suffering
of
the
blind
should
ever
be
his
if
she
won
the
right
to
be
beside
him
always
well
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
i
motored
to
the
station
with
sir
deryck
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
noticed
all
you
describe
i
have
never
before
felt
nervous
in
a
motor
but
i
realised
yesterday
how
largely
that
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
all
the
time
one
keeps
an
unconscious
measuring
distances
judging
speed
and
knowing
what
each
turn
of
the
handle
means
so
when
we
go
out
you
must
let
me
be
eyes
to
you
in
this
how
good
you
are
said
garth
gratefully
and
did
you
see
sir
deryck
off
no
i
did
not
see
sir
deryck
at
all
but
he
said
and
i
felt
the
kind
strong
grip
of
his
hand
as
he
left
me
in
the
car
and
i
sat
there
and
heard
his
train
start
and
rush
away
into
the
distance
was
it
not
hard
to
you
to
let
him
come
and
go
and
not
to
see
his
face
jane
smiled
yes
it
was
hard
said
nurse
rosemary
but
i
wished
to
experience
that
hardness
it
gives
one
an
awful
blank
feeling
does
it
said
garth
yes
it
almost
makes
one
wish
the
friend
had
not
come
ah
there
was
a
depth
of
contented
comprehension
in
garth
sigh
and
the
brave
heart
which
had
refused
to
lift
the
bandage
to
the
very
last
felt
more
than
recompensed
next
time
i
reach
the
gulf
of
partings
in
sightless
land
continued
garth
i
shall
say
dear
friend
has
stood
here
for
my
sake
oh
and
one
meals
said
nurse
rosemary
laughing
are
they
not
grotesquely
trying
yes
of
course
i
had
forgotten
you
would
understand
all
that
now
i
never
could
explain
to
you
before
why
i
must
have
my
meals
alone
you
know
the
hunt
and
chase
yes
said
nurse
rosemary
and
it
usually
resolves
itself
into
away
and
turns
up
afterwards
unexpectedly
but
dalmain
i
have
thought
out
several
ways
of
helping
so
much
in
that
and
making
it
all
quite
easy
if
you
will
consent
to
have
your
meals
with
me
at
a
small
table
you
will
see
how
smoothly
all
will
work
and
later
on
if
i
am
still
here
when
you
begin
to
have
visitors
you
must
let
me
sit
at
your
left
and
all
my
little
ways
of
helping
would
be
so
unobtrusive
that
no
one
would
notice
oh
thanks
said
garth
i
am
immensely
grateful
i
have
often
been
reminded
of
a
silly
game
we
used
to
play
at
overdene
at
dessert
when
we
were
a
specially
gay
party
do
you
know
the
old
duchess
of
meldrum
or
anyway
you
may
have
heard
of
her
ah
yes
of
course
sir
deryck
knows
her
she
called
him
in
once
to
her
macaw
she
did
not
mention
the
macaw
on
the
telephone
and
sir
deryck
thinking
he
was
wanted
for
the
duchess
threw
up
an
important
engagement
and
went
immediately
luckily
she
was
at
her
town
house
she
would
have
sent
just
the
same
had
she
been
at
overdene
i
wish
you
knew
overdene
the
duchess
gives
perfectly
delightful
parties
in
which
all
the
people
who
really
enjoy
meeting
one
another
find
themselves
together
and
are
well
fed
and
well
housed
and
well
mounted
and
do
exactly
as
they
like
while
the
dear
old
duchess
tramps
in
and
out
with
her
queer
beasts
and
birds
shedding
a
kindly
and
exciting
influence
wherever
she
goes
last
time
i
was
there
she
used
to
let
out
six
egyptian
jerboas
in
the
every
evening
after
dinner
awfully
jolly
little
beggars
like
miniature
kangaroos
they
used
to
go
skipping
about
on
their
hind
legs
frightening
some
of
the
women
into
fits
by
hiding
under
their
gowns
and
making
young
footmen
drop
trays
of
coffee
cups
the
last
importation
is
a
toucan
a
south
american
bird
with
a
beak
like
a
banana
and
a
voice
like
an
old
sheep
in
despair
but
tommy
the
scarlet
macaw
remains
prime
favourite
and
i
must
say
he
is
clever
and
knows
more
than
you
would
think
well
at
overdene
we
used
to
play
a
silly
game
at
dessert
with
muscatels
we
each
put
five
raisins
at
intervals
round
our
plates
then
we
shut
our
eyes
and
made
jabs
at
them
with
forks
whoever
succeeded
first
in
spiking
and
eating
all
five
was
the
winner
the
duchess
never
would
play
she
enjoyed
being
umpire
and
screaming
at
the
people
who
peeped
miss
champion
and
i
she
is
the
duchess
niece
you
know
always
played
fair
and
we
nearly
always
made
a
dead
heat
of
it
yes
said
nurse
rosemary
i
know
that
game
i
thought
of
it
at
once
when
i
had
my
blindfold
meals
ah
cried
garth
had
i
known
i
would
not
have
let
you
do
it
i
knew
that
said
nurse
rosemary
that
was
why
i
garth
passed
his
cup
to
be
refilled
and
leaned
forward
confidentially
now
he
said
i
can
venture
to
tell
you
one
of
my
minor
trials
i
am
always
so
awfully
afraid
of
there
being
a
fly
in
things
ever
since
i
was
a
small
boy
i
have
had
such
a
horror
of
inadvertently
eating
flies
when
i
was
about
six
i
heard
a
lady
visitor
say
to
my
mother
one
has
to
swallow
a
fly
about
once
a
year
i
have
just
swallowed
mine
on
the
way
here
this
terrible
idea
of
an
annual
fly
took
possession
of
my
small
mind
i
used
to
be
thankful
when
it
happened
and
i
got
it
over
i
remember
quickly
finishing
a
bit
of
bread
in
which
i
had
seen
signs
of
legs
and
wings
feeling
it
was
an
easy
way
of
taking
it
and
i
should
thus
be
exempt
for
twelve
glad
months
but
i
had
to
run
up
and
down
the
terrace
with
clenched
hands
while
i
swallowed
it
and
when
i
discovered
the
fallacy
of
the
annual
fly
i
was
just
as
particular
in
my
dread
of
an
accidental
one
i
do
believe
i
ever
sat
down
to
sardines
on
toast
at
a
restaurant
without
looking
under
the
toast
for
my
bugbear
though
as
i
lifted
it
i
felt
rather
like
the
old
woman
who
always
looks
under
the
bed
for
a
burglar
ah
but
since
the
accident
this
foolishly
small
thing
has
made
me
suffer
i
can
not
say
are
you
sure
there
is
not
a
fly
in
this
soup
simpson
would
say
sir
no
fly
sir
and
would
cough
behind
his
hand
and
i
could
never
ask
him
again
nurse
rosemary
leaned
forward
and
placed
his
cup
where
he
could
reach
it
easily
just
touching
his
right
hand
with
the
edge
of
the
saucer
have
all
your
meals
with
me
she
said
in
a
tone
of
such
complete
understanding
that
it
was
almost
a
caress
and
i
can
promise
there
shall
never
be
any
flies
in
anything
could
you
not
trust
my
eyes
for
this
and
garth
replied
with
a
happy
grateful
smile
i
could
trust
your
kind
and
faithful
eyes
for
anything
ah
and
that
reminds
me
i
want
to
intrust
to
them
a
task
i
could
confide
to
no
one
else
is
it
twilight
yet
miss
gray
or
is
an
hour
of
daylight
left
to
us
nurse
rosemary
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
looked
at
her
watch
we
ordered
tea
early
she
said
because
we
came
in
from
our
drive
quite
hungry
it
is
not
five
yet
and
a
radiant
afternoon
the
sun
sets
at
seven
then
the
light
is
good
said
garth
have
you
finished
tea
the
sun
will
be
shining
in
at
the
west
window
of
the
studio
you
know
my
studio
at
the
top
of
the
house
you
fetched
the
studies
of
lady
brand
from
there
i
dare
say
you
noticed
stacks
of
canvases
in
the
corners
some
are
unused
some
contain
mere
sketches
or
studies
some
are
finished
pictures
miss
gray
among
the
latter
are
two
which
i
am
most
anxious
to
identify
and
to
destroy
i
made
simpson
guide
me
up
the
other
day
and
leave
me
there
alone
and
i
tried
to
find
them
by
touch
but
i
could
not
be
sure
and
i
soon
grew
hopelessly
confused
amongst
all
the
canvases
i
did
not
wish
to
ask
simpson
help
because
the
subjects
are
well
somewhat
unusual
and
if
he
found
out
i
had
destroyed
them
it
might
set
him
wondering
and
talking
and
one
hates
to
awaken
curiosity
in
a
servant
i
could
not
fall
back
on
sir
deryck
because
he
would
have
recognised
the
portraits
the
principal
figure
is
known
to
him
when
i
painted
those
pictures
i
never
dreamed
of
any
eye
but
my
own
seeing
them
so
you
my
dear
and
trusted
secretary
are
the
one
person
to
whom
i
can
turn
will
you
do
what
i
ask
and
will
you
do
it
now
nurse
rosemary
pushed
back
her
chair
why
of
course
dalmain
i
am
here
to
do
anything
and
everything
you
may
desire
and
to
do
it
when
you
desire
it
garth
took
a
key
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
there
is
the
studio
i
think
the
canvases
i
want
are
in
the
corner
furthest
from
the
door
behind
a
yellow
japanese
screen
they
are
large
five
feet
by
three
and
a
half
if
they
are
too
cumbersome
for
you
to
bring
down
lay
them
face
to
face
and
ring
for
simpson
but
do
not
leave
him
alone
with
them
nurse
rosemary
picked
up
the
key
rose
and
went
over
to
the
piano
which
she
opened
then
she
tightened
the
purple
cord
which
guided
garth
from
his
chair
to
the
instrument
sit
and
play
she
said
while
i
am
upstairs
doing
your
commission
but
just
tell
me
one
thing
you
know
how
greatly
your
work
interests
me
when
i
find
the
pictures
is
it
your
wish
that
i
give
them
a
mere
cursory
glance
just
sufficient
for
identification
or
may
i
look
at
them
in
the
beautiful
studio
light
you
can
trust
me
to
do
whichever
you
desire
the
artist
in
garth
could
not
resist
the
wish
to
have
his
work
seen
and
appreciated
you
may
look
at
them
of
course
if
you
wish
he
sail
they
are
quite
the
best
work
i
ever
did
though
i
painted
them
wholly
from
memory
that
is
i
mean
that
used
to
be
a
knack
of
mine
and
they
are
in
no
sense
imaginary
i
painted
exactly
what
i
saw
at
least
so
far
as
the
female
face
and
figure
are
concerned
and
they
make
the
pictures
the
others
are
mere
accessories
he
stood
up
and
went
to
the
piano
his
fingers
began
to
stray
softly
amongst
the
harmonies
of
the
veni
nurse
rosemary
moved
towards
the
door
how
shall
i
know
them
she
asked
and
waited
the
chords
of
the
veni
hushed
to
a
murmur
garth
voice
from
the
piano
came
clear
and
distinct
but
blending
with
the
harmonies
as
if
he
were
reciting
to
music
a
woman
and
a
man
alone
in
a
garden
but
the
surroundings
are
only
indicated
she
is
in
evening
dress
soft
black
and
trailing
with
lace
at
her
breast
it
is
called
wife
yes
the
same
woman
the
same
scene
but
without
the
man
this
time
no
need
to
paint
the
man
for
now
visible
or
invisible
to
her
he
is
always
there
in
her
arms
she
holds
the
low
murmur
of
chords
ceased
there
was
perfect
silence
in
the
a
little
child
it
is
called
mother
the
veni
burst
forth
in
an
unrestrained
upbearing
of
confident
petition
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
and
the
door
closed
behind
nurse
rosemary
chapter
xxviii
in
the
studio
jane
mounted
to
the
studio
unlocked
the
door
and
entering
closed
it
after
her
the
evening
sun
shone
through
a
western
window
imparting
an
added
richness
to
the
silk
screens
and
hangings
the
mauve
wistaria
of
a
japanese
embroidery
or
the
golden
dragon
of
china
on
a
deep
purple
ground
wound
up
in
its
own
interminable
tail
and
showing
rampant
claws
in
unexpected
places
several
times
already
jane
had
been
into
garth
studio
but
always
to
fetch
something
for
which
he
waited
eagerly
below
and
she
had
never
felt
free
to
linger
margery
had
a
duplicate
key
for
she
herself
went
up
every
day
to
open
the
windows
dust
tenderly
all
special
treasures
and
keep
it
exactly
as
its
owner
had
liked
it
kept
when
his
quick
eyes
could
look
around
it
but
this
key
was
always
on
margery
bunch
and
jane
did
not
like
to
ask
admission
and
risk
a
possible
refusal
now
however
she
could
take
her
own
time
and
she
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
low
and
very
deep
wicker
comfortably
upholstered
so
exactly
fitting
her
proportions
and
supporting
arms
knees
and
head
just
rightly
that
it
seemed
as
if
all
other
chairs
would
in
future
appear
inadequate
owing
to
the
absolute
perfection
of
this
one
ah
to
be
just
that
to
her
beloved
to
so
fully
meet
his
need
at
every
point
that
her
presence
should
be
to
him
always
a
source
of
strength
and
rest
and
consolation
she
looked
around
the
room
it
was
so
like
garth
every
detail
perfect
every
shade
of
colour
enhancing
another
and
being
enhanced
by
it
the
arrangements
for
regulating
the
light
both
from
roof
and
windows
the
easels
of
all
kinds
and
sizes
clean
bareness
where
space
and
freedom
from
dust
were
required
the
luxurious
comfort
round
the
fireplace
and
in
nooks
and
corners
all
were
so
perfect
and
the
plain
brown
of
that
beautiful
quiet
shade
which
has
in
it
no
red
and
no
yellow
a
clear
on
an
easel
near
the
further
window
stood
an
unfinished
painting
palette
and
brushes
beside
it
just
as
garth
had
left
them
when
he
went
out
on
that
morning
nearly
three
months
ago
and
vaulting
over
a
gate
to
protect
a
little
animal
from
unnecessary
pain
was
plunged
himself
into
such
utter
loss
and
anguish
jane
rose
and
took
stock
of
all
his
quaint
treasures
on
the
mantelpiece
especially
her
mind
was
held
and
fascinated
by
a
stout
little
bear
in
brass
sitting
solidly
yet
jauntily
on
its
haunches
its
front
paws
clasping
a
brazen
pole
its
head
turned
sideways
its
small
beady
eyes
looking
straight
before
it
the
chain
from
its
neck
to
the
pole
denoted
captivity
and
possible
fierceness
jane
had
no
doubt
its
head
would
lift
and
its
body
prove
a
receptacle
for
matches
but
she
felt
equally
certain
that
should
she
lift
its
head
and
look
no
matches
would
be
within
it
this
little
bear
was
unmistakably
early
victorian
a
friend
of
childhood
days
and
would
not
be
put
to
common
uses
she
lifted
the
head
the
body
was
empty
she
replaced
it
gently
on
the
mantelpiece
and
realised
that
she
was
deliberately
postponing
an
ordeal
which
must
be
faced
deryck
had
told
her
of
garth
pictures
of
the
one
woman
garth
himself
had
now
told
her
even
more
but
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
see
them
for
herself
it
was
useless
to
postpone
the
moment
she
looked
towards
the
yellow
screen
then
she
walked
over
to
the
western
window
and
threw
it
wide
open
the
sun
was
dipping
gently
towards
the
purple
hills
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
began
to
pale
as
a
hint
of
lovely
rose
crept
into
it
jane
looked
heavenward
and
thrusting
her
hands
deeply
into
her
pockets
spoke
aloud
before
god
she
said
in
case
i
am
never
able
to
say
or
think
it
again
i
will
say
it
now
i
believe
i
was
right
i
considered
garth
future
happiness
and
i
considered
my
own
i
decided
as
i
did
for
both
our
sakes
at
terrible
cost
to
present
joy
but
before
god
i
believed
i
was
right
and
i
believe
it
still
jane
never
said
it
again
chapter
xxix
jane
looks
into
love
mirror
behind
the
yellow
screen
jane
found
a
great
confusion
of
canvases
and
unmistakable
evidence
of
the
blind
hands
which
had
groped
about
in
a
vain
search
and
then
made
fruitless
endeavours
to
sort
and
rearrange
very
tenderly
jane
picked
up
each
canvas
from
the
fallen
heap
turning
it
the
right
way
up
and
standing
it
with
its
face
to
the
wall
beautiful
work
was
there
some
of
it
finished
some
incomplete
one
or
two
faces
she
knew
looked
out
at
her
in
their
pictured
loveliness
but
the
canvases
she
sought
were
not
there
she
straightened
herself
and
looked
around
in
a
further
corner
partly
concealed
by
a
cairo
screen
stood
another
pile
jane
went
to
them
almost
immediately
she
found
the
two
she
wanted
larger
than
the
rest
and
distinguishable
at
a
glance
by
the
soft
black
gown
of
the
central
figure
without
giving
them
more
than
a
passing
look
she
carried
them
over
to
the
western
window
and
placed
them
in
a
good
light
then
she
drew
up
the
chair
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
took
the
little
brass
bear
in
her
left
hand
as
a
talisman
to
help
her
through
what
lay
before
her
turned
the
second
picture
with
its
face
to
the
easel
and
sat
down
to
the
quiet
contemplation
of
the
first
the
noble
figure
of
a
woman
nobly
painted
was
the
first
impression
which
leapt
from
eye
to
brain
yes
nobility
came
first
in
stately
pose
in
uplifted
brow
in
breadth
of
dignity
then
as
you
marked
the
grandly
massive
figure
too
to
be
cumbersome
but
large
and
full
and
amply
developed
the
length
of
limb
the
firmly
planted
feet
the
large
capable
hands
you
realised
the
second
impression
conveyed
by
the
picture
to
be
strength
strength
to
do
strength
to
be
strength
to
continue
then
you
looked
into
the
face
and
there
you
were
confronted
with
a
great
surprise
the
third
thought
expressed
by
the
picture
was
love
love
of
the
highest
holiest
most
ideal
kind
yet
withal
of
the
most
tenderly
human
order
and
you
found
it
in
that
face
it
was
a
large
face
well
proportioned
to
the
figure
it
had
no
pretensions
whatever
to
ordinary
beauty
the
features
were
good
there
was
not
an
ugly
line
about
them
and
yet
each
one
just
missed
the
beautiful
and
the
general
effect
was
of
a
plainness
unadorned
unconcealed
and
unashamed
but
the
longer
you
looked
the
more
desirable
grew
the
face
the
less
you
noticed
its
negations
the
more
you
admired
its
honesty
its
purity
its
immense
strength
of
purpose
its
noble
simplicity
you
took
in
all
these
outward
details
you
looked
away
for
a
moment
to
consider
them
you
looked
back
to
verify
them
and
then
the
miracle
happened
into
the
face
had
stolen
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
it
shone
from
the
quiet
grey
eyes
as
over
the
head
of
the
man
who
knelt
before
her
they
looked
out
of
the
picture
with
an
expression
of
the
sublime
surrender
of
a
woman
whole
soul
to
an
emotion
which
though
it
sways
and
masters
her
yet
gives
her
the
power
to
be
more
truly
herself
than
ever
before
the
startled
joy
in
them
the
marvel
at
a
mystery
not
yet
understood
the
passionate
tenderness
and
yet
the
almost
divine
compassion
for
the
unrestrained
violence
of
feeling
which
had
flung
the
man
to
his
knees
and
driven
him
to
the
haven
of
her
breast
the
yearning
to
soothe
and
give
and
content
all
these
were
blended
into
a
look
of
such
exquisite
sweetness
that
it
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
beholder
the
woman
was
seated
on
a
broad
marble
parapet
she
looked
straight
before
her
her
knees
came
well
forward
and
the
long
curve
of
the
train
of
her
black
gown
filled
the
foreground
on
the
right
on
the
left
slightly
to
one
side
of
her
knelt
a
man
a
tall
slight
figure
in
evening
dress
his
arms
thrown
forward
around
her
waist
his
face
completely
hidden
in
the
soft
lace
at
her
bosom
only
the
back
of
his
sleek
dark
head
visible
and
yet
the
whole
figure
denoted
a
passion
of
tense
emotion
she
had
gathered
him
to
her
with
what
you
knew
must
have
been
an
exquisite
gesture
combining
the
utter
of
the
woman
with
the
tender
throb
of
maternal
solicitude
and
now
her
hands
were
clasped
behind
his
head
holding
him
closely
to
her
not
a
word
was
being
spoken
the
hidden
face
was
obviously
silent
and
her
firm
lips
above
his
dark
head
were
folded
in
a
line
of
calm
though
about
them
hovered
the
dawning
of
a
smile
of
bliss
ineffable
a
crimson
rambler
rose
climbing
some
woodwork
faintly
indicated
on
the
left
and
hanging
in
a
glowing
mass
from
the
top
corner
supplied
the
only
vivid
colour
in
the
picture
but
from
taking
in
these
minor
details
the
eye
returned
to
that
calm
tender
face
alight
with
love
to
those
strong
capable
hands
now
learning
for
the
first
time
to
put
forth
the
protective
passion
of
a
woman
tenderness
and
the
mind
whispered
the
only
possible
name
for
that
picture
the
wife
jane
gazed
at
it
long
in
silence
had
garth
little
bear
been
anything
less
solid
than
early
victorian
brass
it
must
have
bent
and
broken
under
the
strong
pressure
of
those
clenched
hands
she
could
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
she
looked
upon
herself
but
oh
merciful
heavens
how
unlike
the
reflected
self
of
her
own
mirror
once
or
twice
as
she
looked
her
mind
refused
to
work
and
she
simply
gazed
blankly
at
the
minor
details
of
the
picture
but
then
again
the
expression
of
the
grey
eyes
drew
her
recalling
so
vividly
every
feeling
she
had
experienced
when
that
dear
head
had
come
so
unexpectedly
to
its
upon
her
bosom
it
is
true
she
whispered
and
again
yes
it
is
true
i
can
not
deny
it
it
is
as
i
felt
it
must
be
as
i
looked
and
then
suddenly
she
fell
upon
her
knees
before
the
picture
oh
my
god
is
that
as
i
looked
and
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
my
boy
lifting
his
shining
eyes
and
gazing
at
me
in
the
moonlight
is
this
what
he
saw
did
i
look
so
and
did
the
woman
who
looked
so
and
who
looking
so
pressed
his
head
down
again
upon
her
breast
refuse
next
day
to
marry
him
on
the
grounds
of
his
youth
and
her
superiority
oh
garth
garth
o
god
help
him
to
understand
help
him
to
forgive
me
in
the
just
below
maggie
the
housemaid
was
singing
as
she
sewed
the
sound
floated
through
the
open
window
each
syllable
distinct
in
the
clear
scotch
voice
and
reached
jane
where
she
knelt
her
mind
stunned
to
blankness
by
its
pain
took
eager
hold
upon
the
words
of
maggie
hymn
and
they
were
these
o
love
that
will
not
let
me
go
i
rest
my
weary
soul
in
thee
i
give
thee
back
the
life
i
owe
that
in
thine
ocean
depths
its
flow
may
richer
fuller
be
o
light
that
followest
all
my
way
i
yield
my
torch
to
thee
my
heart
restores
its
borrowed
ray
that
in
thy
sunshine
blaze
its
day
may
brighter
fairer
be
jane
took
the
second
picture
and
placed
it
in
front
of
the
first
the
same
woman
seated
as
before
but
the
man
was
not
there
and
in
her
arms
its
tiny
dark
head
pillowed
against
the
fulness
of
her
breast
lay
a
little
child
the
woman
did
not
look
over
that
small
head
but
bent
above
it
and
gazed
into
the
baby
face
the
crimson
rambler
had
grown
right
across
the
picture
and
formed
a
glowing
arch
above
mother
and
child
a
majesty
of
tenderness
was
in
the
large
figure
of
the
mother
the
face
as
regarded
contour
and
features
was
no
less
plain
but
again
it
was
transfigured
by
the
thereon
depicted
you
knew
the
wife
had
more
than
fulfilled
her
abundant
promise
the
wife
was
there
in
fullest
realisation
and
added
to
wifehood
the
wonder
of
motherhood
all
mysteries
were
explained
all
joys
experienced
and
the
smile
on
her
calm
lips
bespoke
ineffable
content
a
rambler
rose
had
burst
above
them
and
fallen
in
a
shower
of
crimson
petals
upon
mother
and
child
the
clasped
tightly
the
soft
lace
at
her
bosom
a
petal
had
fallen
upon
the
tiny
wrist
she
had
lifted
her
hand
to
remove
it
and
catching
the
so
dark
and
shining
paused
for
a
moment
and
smiled
jane
watching
them
fell
to
desperate
weeping
the
mere
boy
had
understood
her
potential
possibilities
of
motherhood
far
better
than
she
understood
them
herself
having
had
one
glimpse
of
her
as
the
wife
his
mind
had
leaped
on
and
seen
her
as
the
mother
and
again
she
was
forced
to
say
it
is
true
yes
it
is
true
and
then
she
recalled
the
old
line
of
cruel
reasoning
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
would
have
wanted
to
see
always
in
front
of
one
at
table
was
this
the
sort
of
face
this
as
garth
had
painted
it
after
a
supposed
year
of
marriage
would
any
man
weary
of
it
or
wish
to
turn
away
his
eyes
jane
took
one
more
long
look
then
she
dropped
the
little
bear
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
while
a
hot
blush
crept
up
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
and
tingled
to
her
below
the
fresh
young
voice
was
singing
again
o
joy
that
seekest
me
through
pain
i
can
not
close
my
heart
to
thee
i
trace
the
rainbow
through
the
rain
and
feel
the
promise
is
not
vain
that
morn
shall
tearless
be
after
a
while
jane
whispered
oh
my
darling
forgive
me
i
was
altogether
wrong
i
will
confess
and
god
helping
me
i
will
explain
and
oh
my
darling
you
will
forgive
me
once
more
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
the
picture
a
few
stray
petals
of
the
crimson
rambler
lay
upon
the
ground
reminding
her
of
those
crushed
roses
which
falling
from
her
breast
lay
scattered
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
emblem
of
the
joyous
hopes
and
glory
of
love
which
her
decision
of
that
night
had
laid
in
the
dust
of
disillusion
but
crowning
this
picture
in
rich
clusters
of
abundant
bloom
grew
the
rambler
rose
and
through
the
open
window
came
the
final
verse
of
maggie
hymn
o
cross
that
liftest
up
my
head
i
dare
not
ask
to
fly
from
thee
i
lay
in
dust
life
glory
dead
and
from
the
ground
there
blossoms
red
life
that
shall
endless
be
jane
went
to
the
western
window
and
stood
with
her
arms
stretched
above
her
looking
out
upon
the
radiance
of
the
sunset
the
sky
blazed
into
gold
and
crimson
at
the
horizon
gradually
as
the
eye
lifted
paling
to
primrose
flecked
with
rosy
clouds
and
overhead
deep
blue
fathomless
boundless
blue
jane
gazed
at
the
golden
battlements
above
the
purple
hills
and
repeated
half
aloud
and
the
city
was
of
pure
gold
and
had
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
did
lighten
it
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
ah
how
much
had
passed
away
since
she
stood
at
that
western
window
not
an
hour
before
all
life
seemed
readjusted
its
outlook
altered
its
perspective
changed
truly
garth
had
gone
behind
his
blindness
jane
raised
her
eyes
to
the
blue
and
a
smile
of
unspeakable
anticipation
parted
her
lips
life
that
shall
endless
be
she
murmured
then
turning
found
the
little
bear
and
restored
him
to
his
place
upon
the
mantelpiece
put
back
the
chair
closed
the
western
window
and
picking
up
the
two
canvases
left
the
studio
and
made
her
way
carefully
downstairs
chapter
xxx
the
lady
portrayed
it
has
taken
you
long
miss
gray
i
nearly
sent
simpson
up
to
find
out
what
had
happened
i
am
glad
you
did
not
do
that
dalmain
simpson
would
have
found
me
weeping
on
the
studio
floor
and
to
ask
his
assistance
under
those
circumstances
would
have
been
more
humbling
than
inquiring
after
the
fly
in
the
soup
garth
turned
quickly
in
his
chair
the
had
caught
the
tone
which
meant
comprehension
of
his
work
weeping
he
said
why
because
answered
nurse
rosemary
i
have
been
entranced
these
pictures
are
so
exquisite
they
stir
one
deepest
depths
and
yet
they
are
so
pathetic
ah
so
pathetic
because
you
have
made
a
plain
woman
beautiful
garth
rose
to
his
feet
and
turned
upon
her
a
face
which
would
have
blazed
had
it
not
been
sightless
a
what
he
exclaimed
a
plain
woman
repeated
nurse
rosemary
quietly
surely
you
realised
your
model
to
be
that
and
therein
lies
the
wonder
of
the
pictures
you
have
so
beautified
her
by
wifehood
and
glorified
her
by
motherhood
that
the
longer
one
looks
the
more
one
forgets
her
plainness
seeing
her
as
loving
and
loved
lovable
and
therefore
lovely
it
is
a
triumph
of
art
garth
sat
down
his
hands
clasped
before
him
it
is
a
triumph
of
truth
he
said
i
painted
what
i
saw
you
painted
her
soul
said
nurse
rosemary
and
it
illuminated
her
plain
face
i
saw
her
soul
said
garth
almost
in
a
whisper
and
that
vision
was
so
radiant
that
it
illumined
my
dark
life
the
remembrance
lightens
my
darkness
even
now
a
very
tender
silence
fell
in
the
library
the
twilight
deepened
then
nurse
rosemary
spoke
very
low
dalmain
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
i
want
to
beg
you
not
to
destroy
these
pictures
garth
lifted
his
head
i
must
destroy
them
child
he
said
i
can
not
risk
their
being
seen
by
people
who
would
recognise
my
the
the
lady
portrayed
at
all
events
there
is
one
person
who
must
see
them
before
they
are
destroyed
and
that
is
queried
garth
the
lady
portrayed
said
nurse
rosemary
bravely
how
do
you
know
she
has
not
seen
them
has
she
inquired
nurse
rosemary
no
said
garth
shortly
and
she
never
will
she
must
something
in
the
tone
of
quiet
insistence
struck
garth
why
he
asked
and
listened
with
interest
for
the
answer
because
of
all
it
would
mean
to
a
woman
who
knows
herself
plain
to
see
herself
thus
beautified
garth
sat
very
still
for
a
few
moments
then
a
woman
who
knows
herself
plain
he
repeated
with
interrogative
amazement
in
his
voice
yes
proceeded
nurse
rosemary
encouraged
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
that
lady
mirror
has
ever
shown
her
a
reflection
in
any
way
approaching
what
you
have
made
her
in
these
pictures
when
we
stand
before
our
dalmain
scowling
anxiously
at
hats
and
bows
and
partings
we
usually
look
our
very
worst
and
that
lady
at
her
very
worst
would
be
of
a
most
discouraging
plainness
garth
sat
perfectly
silent
depend
upon
it
continued
nurse
rosemary
she
never
sees
herself
as
wife
mother
is
she
a
wife
garth
hesitated
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
yes
he
said
very
quietly
jane
hands
flew
to
her
breast
her
heart
must
be
held
down
or
he
would
hear
it
throbbing
nurse
rosemary
voice
had
in
it
only
a
slight
tremor
when
she
spoke
again
is
she
a
mother
no
said
garth
i
painted
what
might
have
been
if
if
it
had
been
replied
garth
curtly
nurse
rosemary
felt
rebuked
dear
dalmain
she
said
humbly
i
realise
how
officious
i
must
seem
to
you
with
all
these
questions
and
suggestions
but
you
must
blame
the
hold
these
wonderful
paintings
of
yours
have
taken
on
my
mind
oh
they
are
beautiful
beautiful
ah
said
garth
the
keen
pleasure
of
the
artist
springing
up
once
more
miss
gray
i
have
somewhat
forgotten
them
have
you
them
here
that
is
right
put
them
up
before
you
and
describe
them
to
me
let
me
hear
how
they
struck
you
as
pictures
jane
rose
and
went
to
the
window
she
threw
it
open
and
as
she
breathed
in
the
fresh
air
breathed
out
a
passionate
prayer
that
her
nerve
her
voice
her
might
not
fail
her
in
this
critical
hour
she
herself
had
been
convicted
by
garth
pictures
now
she
must
convince
garth
by
her
description
of
them
he
must
be
made
to
believe
in
the
love
he
had
depicted
then
nurse
rosemary
sat
down
and
in
the
gentle
unemotional
voice
which
was
quite
her
own
described
to
the
eager
ears
of
the
blind
artist
exactly
what
jane
had
seen
in
the
studio
it
was
perfectly
done
it
was
mercilessly
done
all
the
desperate
hopeless
hunger
for
jane
awoke
in
garth
the
maddening
knowledge
that
she
had
been
his
and
yet
not
his
that
had
he
pressed
for
her
answer
that
evening
it
could
not
have
been
a
refusal
that
the
cold
calculations
of
later
hours
had
no
place
in
those
moments
of
ecstasy
yet
he
lost
her
lost
her
why
ah
why
was
there
any
possible
reason
other
than
the
one
she
gave
nurse
rosemary
quiet
voice
went
on
regardless
of
his
writhings
but
she
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
it
is
such
a
beautiful
crimson
rambler
dalmain
she
said
i
like
the
idea
of
its
being
small
and
in
bud
in
the
first
picture
and
blooming
in
full
glory
in
the
second
garth
pulled
himself
together
and
smiled
he
must
not
give
way
before
this
girl
yes
he
said
i
am
glad
you
noticed
that
and
look
here
we
will
not
destroy
them
at
once
now
they
are
found
there
is
no
hurry
i
am
afraid
i
am
giving
you
a
lot
of
trouble
but
will
you
ask
for
some
large
sheets
of
brown
paper
and
make
a
package
and
write
upon
it
to
be
opened
and
tell
margery
to
put
them
back
in
the
studio
then
when
i
want
them
at
any
time
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
identifying
them
i
am
so
glad
said
nurse
rosemary
then
perhaps
the
plain
lady
i
can
not
have
her
spoken
of
so
said
garth
hotly
i
do
not
know
what
she
thought
of
herself
i
doubt
if
she
ever
gave
a
thought
to
self
at
all
i
do
not
know
what
you
would
have
thought
of
her
i
can
only
tell
you
that
to
me
hers
is
the
one
face
which
is
visible
in
my
darkness
all
the
loveliness
i
have
painted
all
the
beauty
i
have
admired
fades
from
my
mental
vision
as
wreaths
of
mist
flutters
from
memory
sight
as
autumn
leaves
her
face
alone
abides
calm
holy
tender
beautiful
it
is
always
before
me
and
it
pains
me
that
one
who
has
only
seen
her
as
my
hand
depicted
her
should
speak
of
her
as
plain
forgive
me
said
nurse
rosemary
humbly
i
did
not
mean
to
pain
you
sir
and
to
show
you
what
your
pictures
have
done
for
me
may
i
tell
you
a
resolution
i
made
in
the
studio
i
can
not
miss
what
they
depict
the
sweetest
joys
of
life
for
want
of
the
courage
to
confess
myself
wrong
pocket
my
pride
and
be
frank
and
humble
i
am
going
to
write
a
full
confession
to
my
young
man
as
to
my
share
of
the
misunderstanding
which
has
parted
us
do
you
think
he
will
understand
do
you
think
he
will
forgive
garth
smiled
he
tried
to
call
up
an
image
of
a
pretty
troubled
face
framed
in
a
fluffy
setting
of
soft
fair
hair
it
harmonised
so
little
with
the
voice
but
it
undoubtedly
was
nurse
rosemary
gray
as
others
saw
her
he
will
be
a
brute
if
he
does
child
he
said
chapter
xxxi
in
lighter
vein
dinner
that
evening
the
first
at
their
small
round
table
was
a
great
success
nurse
rosemary
plans
all
worked
well
and
garth
delighted
in
arrangements
which
made
him
feel
less
helpless
the
strain
of
the
afternoon
brought
its
reaction
of
merriment
a
little
judicious
questioning
drew
forth
further
stories
of
the
duchess
and
her
pets
and
miss
champion
name
came
in
with
a
frequency
which
they
both
enjoyed
it
was
a
curious
experience
for
jane
to
hear
herself
described
in
garth
vivid
until
that
fatal
evening
at
shenstone
she
had
been
remarkably
free
from
and
she
had
no
idea
that
she
had
a
way
of
looking
straight
into
people
eyes
when
she
talked
to
them
and
that
that
was
what
muddled
up
the
silly
little
minds
of
women
who
say
they
are
afraid
of
her
and
that
she
makes
them
nervous
you
see
she
looks
right
into
their
shallow
shuffling
little
souls
full
of
conceited
thoughts
about
themselves
and
nasty
thoughts
about
her
and
no
wonder
they
grow
and
flee
and
talk
of
her
as
formidable
miss
champion
i
never
found
her
formidable
but
when
i
had
the
chance
of
a
real
talk
with
her
i
used
to
be
thankful
i
had
nothing
of
which
to
be
ashamed
those
clear
eyes
touched
bottom
every
time
as
our
kindred
over
the
water
so
expressively
put
it
neither
had
jane
any
idea
that
she
always
talked
with
a
poker
if
possible
building
up
the
fire
while
she
built
up
her
own
argument
or
attacking
it
vigorously
while
she
demolished
her
opponent
that
she
stirred
the
fire
with
her
toe
but
her
very
smart
boots
never
seemed
any
the
worse
that
when
pondering
a
difficult
problem
she
usually
stood
holding
her
chin
in
her
right
hand
until
she
had
found
the
solution
all
these
small
characteristics
garth
described
with
vivid
touch
and
dwelt
upon
with
a
tenacity
of
remembrance
which
astonished
jane
and
revealed
him
in
his
relation
to
herself
three
years
before
in
a
new
light
his
love
for
her
had
been
so
suddenly
disclosed
and
had
at
once
had
to
be
considered
as
a
thing
to
be
either
accepted
or
put
away
so
that
when
she
decided
to
put
it
away
it
seemed
not
to
have
had
time
to
become
in
any
sense
part
of
her
life
she
had
viewed
it
realised
all
it
might
have
meant
and
put
it
from
her
but
now
she
understood
how
different
it
had
been
for
garth
during
the
week
which
preceded
his
declaration
he
had
realised
to
the
full
the
meaning
of
their
growing
intimacy
and
as
his
certainty
increased
he
had
more
and
more
woven
her
into
his
life
his
vivid
imagination
causing
her
to
appear
as
his
beloved
from
the
first
loved
and
wanted
when
as
yet
they
were
merely
acquaintances
kindred
spirits
friends
to
find
herself
thus
shrined
in
his
heart
and
memory
was
infinitely
touching
to
jane
and
seemed
to
promise
with
sweet
certainty
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
come
home
there
to
abide
when
once
all
barriers
between
them
were
removed
after
dinner
garth
sat
long
at
the
piano
filling
the
room
with
harmony
once
or
twice
the
theme
of
the
rosary
crept
in
and
jane
listened
anxiously
for
its
development
but
almost
immediately
it
gave
way
to
something
else
it
seemed
rather
to
haunt
the
other
melodies
than
to
be
actually
there
itself
when
garth
left
the
piano
and
guided
by
the
purple
cord
reached
his
chair
nurse
rosemary
said
gently
dalmain
can
you
spare
me
for
a
few
days
at
the
end
of
this
week
oh
why
said
garth
to
go
where
and
for
how
long
ah
i
know
i
ought
to
say
delighted
after
all
your
goodness
to
me
but
i
really
can
not
you
do
know
what
life
was
without
you
when
you
that
seemed
months
even
though
brand
was
here
it
is
your
own
fault
for
making
yourself
so
indispensable
nurse
rosemary
smiled
i
daresay
i
shall
not
be
away
for
long
she
said
that
is
if
you
want
me
i
can
return
but
dalmain
i
intend
to
write
that
letter
of
which
i
told
you
i
shall
post
it
i
must
follow
it
up
almost
immediately
i
must
be
with
him
when
he
receives
it
or
soon
afterwards
i
think
i
hope
he
will
want
me
at
once
this
is
monday
may
i
go
on
thursday
poor
garth
looked
blankly
dismayed
do
nurses
as
a
rule
leave
their
patients
and
rush
off
to
their
young
men
in
order
to
find
out
how
they
have
liked
their
letters
he
inquired
in
mock
protest
not
as
a
rule
sir
replied
nurse
rosemary
demurely
but
this
is
an
exceptional
case
i
shall
wire
to
brand
he
will
send
you
a
more
efficient
and
more
dependable
person
oh
you
wicked
little
thing
cried
garth
if
miss
champion
were
here
she
would
shake
you
you
know
perfectly
well
that
nobody
could
fill
your
place
it
is
good
of
you
to
say
so
sir
replied
nurse
rosemary
meekly
and
is
miss
champion
much
addicted
to
shaking
people
do
call
me
yes
when
people
are
tiresome
she
often
says
she
would
like
to
shake
them
and
one
has
a
mental
vision
of
how
their
teeth
would
chatter
there
is
a
certain
little
lady
of
our
acquaintance
whom
we
always
call
she
is
in
our
set
but
she
calls
upon
it
and
sometimes
it
asks
her
to
lunch
for
fun
if
you
inquire
whether
she
likes
a
thing
she
says
i
do
and
i
do
if
you
ask
whether
she
is
going
to
a
certain
function
she
says
i
am
and
i
not
and
if
you
send
her
a
note
imploring
a
straight
answer
to
a
direct
question
the
answer
comes
back
and
no
miss
champion
used
to
say
she
would
like
to
take
her
up
by
the
scruff
of
her
feather
boa
and
shake
her
asking
at
intervals
i
stop
so
as
to
wring
from
a
definite
affirmative
for
once
could
miss
champion
carry
out
such
a
threat
is
she
a
very
massive
person
well
she
could
you
know
but
she
would
she
is
most
awfully
kind
even
to
little
freaks
she
laughs
at
no
she
is
massive
that
word
does
not
describe
her
at
all
but
she
is
large
and
very
finely
developed
do
you
know
the
venus
of
milo
yes
in
the
louvre
i
am
glad
you
know
paris
well
just
imagine
the
venus
of
milo
in
a
coat
and
skirt
and
you
have
miss
champion
nurse
rosemary
laughed
hysterically
either
the
venus
of
milo
or
miss
champion
or
this
combination
of
both
proved
too
much
for
her
little
dicky
brand
summed
up
rather
well
pursued
garth
she
was
calling
at
wimpole
street
on
lady
brand
day
and
dicky
stood
talking
to
me
in
his
black
velvets
and
white
waistcoat
a
miniature
edition
of
sir
deryck
he
indicated
on
a
distant
lounge
and
remarked
lady
never
knows
she
always
thinks
i
asked
her
if
her
little
girl
might
come
to
my
party
and
she
said
i
think
so
now
if
she
had
asked
me
if
i
was
coming
to
her
party
i
should
have
said
thank
you
i
am
it
is
very
trying
when
people
only
think
about
important
things
such
as
little
girls
and
parties
because
their
thinking
never
amounts
to
much
it
does
not
so
much
matter
what
they
think
about
other
things
the
weather
for
instance
because
that
all
happens
whether
they
think
or
not
mummie
asked
that
lady
whether
it
was
raining
when
she
got
here
and
she
said
i
think
not
i
ca
imagine
why
mummie
always
wants
to
know
what
her
friends
think
about
the
weather
i
have
heard
her
ask
seven
ladies
this
afternoon
whether
it
is
raining
now
if
father
or
i
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
raining
we
should
just
step
over
to
the
window
and
look
out
and
then
come
back
and
go
do
with
really
interesting
conversation
but
mummie
asks
them
whether
it
is
raining
or
whether
they
think
it
has
been
raining
or
is
going
to
rain
and
when
they
have
told
her
she
hurries
away
and
asks
somebody
else
i
asked
the
thinking
lady
in
the
feather
thing
whether
she
knew
who
the
father
and
mother
were
of
the
young
lady
whom
cain
married
and
she
said
well
i
do
and
i
do
i
said
if
you
do
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
and
if
you
do
perhaps
you
would
like
to
take
my
hand
and
we
will
walk
over
together
and
ask
the
bishop
the
one
with
the
thin
legs
and
the
gold
cross
talking
to
mummie
but
she
thought
she
had
to
go
quite
in
a
hurry
so
i
saw
her
off
and
then
asked
the
bishop
alone
bishops
are
most
satisfactory
kind
of
people
because
they
are
quite
sure
about
everything
and
you
feel
safe
in
quoting
them
to
nurse
nurse
told
marsdon
that
this
one
is
in
sheep
clothing
because
he
wears
a
gold
cross
i
saw
the
cross
but
i
saw
no
clothing
i
was
looking
out
for
the
kind
of
woolly
thing
our
new
curate
wears
on
his
back
in
church
should
you
call
that
sheep
clothing
i
asked
father
and
he
said
no
and
mother
seemed
as
shocked
as
if
father
and
i
had
spoken
in
church
instead
of
just
as
we
came
out
and
she
said
it
is
a
hood
possibly
she
thinks
baa
is
spelled
with
only
one
a
anyway
father
and
i
felt
it
best
to
let
the
subject
drop
nurse
rosemary
laughed
how
exactly
like
dicky
she
said
i
could
hear
his
grave
little
voice
and
almost
see
him
pull
down
his
small
waistcoat
why
do
you
know
the
little
chap
asked
garth
yes
replied
nurse
rosemary
i
have
stayed
with
them
talking
to
dicky
is
an
education
and
baby
blossom
is
a
sweet
romp
here
comes
simpson
how
quickly
the
evening
has
flown
then
may
i
be
off
on
thursday
i
am
helpless
said
garth
i
can
not
say
but
suppose
you
do
not
come
back
then
you
can
wire
to
dr
brand
i
believe
you
want
to
leave
me
said
garth
reproachfully
i
do
and
i
do
laughed
nurse
rosemary
and
fled
from
his
outstretched
hands
when
jane
had
locked
the
earlier
that
evening
and
handed
it
to
simpson
she
had
slipped
in
two
letters
of
her
own
one
was
addressed
to
georgina
duchess
of
meldrum
portland
place
the
other
to
sir
deryck
brand
wimpole
street
both
were
marked
urgent
if
absent
forward
immediately
chapter
xxxii
an
interlude
tuesday
passed
uneventfully
to
all
outward
seeming
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
to
garth
that
his
secretary
had
sat
up
writing
most
of
the
night
only
varying
that
employment
by
spending
long
moments
in
silent
contemplation
of
his
pictures
which
had
found
a
temporary
place
of
safety
on
their
way
back
to
the
studio
in
a
deep
cupboard
in
her
room
of
which
she
had
the
key
if
nurse
rosemary
marked
with
a
pang
of
tender
compunction
the
worn
look
on
garth
face
telling
how
mental
suffering
had
chased
away
sleep
she
made
no
comment
thereupon
thus
tuesday
passed
in
uneventful
monotony
two
telegrams
had
arrived
for
nurse
gray
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
first
came
while
she
was
reading
a
times
leader
aloud
to
garth
simpson
brought
it
in
saying
a
telegram
for
you
miss
it
was
always
a
source
of
gratification
to
simpson
afterwards
that
almost
from
the
first
he
had
been
led
by
what
he
called
his
unhaided
hintuhition
to
drop
the
nurse
and
address
jane
with
the
conventional
miss
in
time
he
almost
convinced
himself
that
he
had
also
discerned
in
her
a
honourable
but
this
margery
graem
firmly
refused
to
allow
she
herself
had
had
her
doots
and
kept
them
to
herself
but
all
simpson
surmisings
had
been
freely
expressed
and
reiterated
in
the
housekeeper
room
and
never
a
word
about
any
honourable
lead
passed
simpson
lips
therefore
graem
berated
him
for
being
so
ready
to
go
astray
and
speak
lies
but
maggie
the
housemaid
had
always
felt
sure
simpson
knew
more
than
he
said
said
more
than
he
knew
you
mean
prompted
old
margery
no
retorted
maggie
i
know
what
i
said
and
i
said
what
i
meant
you
may
have
said
what
you
meant
but
you
did
not
mean
what
you
knew
insisted
margery
and
if
anybody
says
another
word
on
the
matter
shall
say
grace
and
dismiss
the
table
continued
old
margery
exercising
the
cloture
by
virtue
of
her
authority
in
a
way
which
simpson
and
maggie
who
both
wished
for
cheese
afterwards
described
as
mean
but
this
was
long
after
the
uneventful
tuesday
when
simpson
entered
with
a
salver
and
finding
jane
enveloped
in
the
times
said
a
telegram
for
you
miss
nurse
rosemary
took
it
apologised
for
the
interruption
and
opened
it
it
was
from
the
duchess
and
ran
thus
most
inconvenient
as
you
very
well
know
but
am
leaving
euston
will
await
further
orders
at
aberdeen
nurse
rosemary
smiled
and
put
the
telegram
into
her
pocket
no
answer
thank
you
simpson
not
bad
news
i
hope
asked
garth
no
replied
nurse
rosemary
but
it
makes
my
departure
on
thursday
imperative
it
is
from
an
old
aunt
of
mine
who
is
going
to
my
man
home
i
must
be
with
him
before
she
is
or
there
will
be
endless
complications
i
do
believe
he
will
ever
let
you
go
again
when
once
he
gets
you
back
remarked
garth
moodily
you
think
not
said
nurse
rosemary
with
a
tender
little
smile
as
she
took
up
the
paper
and
resumed
her
reading
the
second
telegram
arrived
after
luncheon
garth
was
at
the
piano
thundering
beethoven
funeral
march
on
the
death
of
a
hero
the
room
was
being
rent
asunder
by
mighty
chords
and
simpson
smug
face
and
appearing
noiselessly
in
the
doorway
were
an
insupportable
anticlimax
nurse
rosemary
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
advanced
with
her
firm
noiseless
tread
and
took
the
telegram
she
returned
to
her
seat
and
waited
until
the
hero
obsequies
were
over
and
the
last
roll
of
the
drums
had
died
away
then
she
opened
the
orange
envelope
and
as
she
opened
it
a
strange
thing
happened
garth
began
to
play
the
rosary
the
string
of
pearls
dropped
in
liquid
sound
from
his
fingers
and
nurse
rosemary
read
her
telegram
it
was
from
the
doctor
and
said
special
license
easily
obtained
flower
and
i
will
come
whenever
you
wish
wire
again
the
rosary
drew
to
a
soft
melancholy
close
what
shall
i
play
next
asked
garth
suddenly
veni
creator
spiritus
said
nurse
rosemary
and
bowed
her
head
in
prayer
chapter

something
is
going
to
happen
wednesday
dawned
an
ideal
first
of
may
garth
was
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
jane
heard
him
singing
as
he
passed
beneath
her
window
it
is
not
mine
to
sing
the
stately
grace
the
great
soul
beaming
in
my
lady
face
she
leaned
out
he
was
walking
below
in
the
freshest
of
white
flannels
his
step
so
light
and
elastic
his
every
movement
so
lithe
and
graceful
the
only
sign
of
his
blindness
the
malacca
cane
he
held
in
his
hand
with
which
he
occasionally
touched
the
grass
border
or
the
wall
of
the
house
she
could
only
see
the
top
of
his
dark
head
it
might
have
been
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
three
years
before
she
longed
to
call
from
the
window
darling
my
darling
good
morning
god
bless
you
ah
what
would
bring
forth
the
day
when
her
full
confession
and
explanation
and
plea
for
pardon
would
reach
him
he
was
such
a
boy
in
many
ways
so
loving
artistic
poetic
irrepressible
ever
young
in
spite
of
his
great
affliction
but
where
his
manhood
was
concerned
his
love
his
right
of
choice
and
of
decision
of
maintaining
a
opinion
and
setting
aside
the
less
competent
judgment
of
others
she
knew
him
rigid
inflexible
his
very
pain
seemed
to
cool
him
from
the
molten
lover
to
the
bar
of
steel
as
jane
knelt
at
her
window
that
morning
she
had
not
the
least
idea
whether
the
evening
would
find
her
travelling
to
aberdeen
to
take
the
night
mail
south
or
at
home
forever
in
the
heaven
of
garth
love
and
down
below
he
passed
again
still
singing
but
mine
it
is
to
follow
in
her
train
do
her
behests
in
pleasure
or
in
pain
burn
at
her
altar
love
sweet
frankincense
and
worship
her
in
distant
reverence
ah
beloved
whispered
jane
not
if
you
want
her
and
call
her
it
will
be
to
the
closest
closeness
love
can
devise
no
more
distance
between
you
and
me
and
then
in
the
curious
way
in
which
inspired
words
will
sometimes
occur
to
the
mind
quite
apart
from
their
inspired
context
and
bearing
a
totally
different
meaning
from
that
which
they
primarily
bear
these
words
came
to
jane
for
he
is
our
peace
who
hath
made
both
one
and
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
between
us
that
he
might
reconcile
both
by
the
cross
ah
dear
christ
she
whispered
if
thy
cross
could
do
this
for
jew
and
gentile
may
not
my
boy
heavy
cross
so
bravely
borne
do
it
for
him
and
for
me
so
shall
we
come
at
last
indeed
to
the
cross
the
breakfast
gong
boomed
through
the
house
simpson
loved
gongs
he
considered
them
haristocratic
he
always
gave
full
measure
nurse
rosemary
went
down
to
breakfast
garth
came
in
through
the
french
window
humming
the
thousand
beauties
that
i
know
so
well
he
was
in
his
gayest
most
inconsequent
mood
he
had
picked
a
golden
rosebud
in
the
conservatory
and
wore
it
in
his
buttonhole
he
carried
a
yellow
rose
in
his
hand
good
day
miss
rosemary
he
said
what
a
may
day
simpson
and
i
were
up
with
the
lark
were
we
simpson
poor
simpson
felt
like
a
sort
of
of
the
may
when
my
electric
bell
trilled
in
his
room
at
but
i
could
stay
in
bed
i
woke
with
my
feeling
and
when
i
was
a
little
chap
and
woke
with
that
margery
used
to
say
up
quickly
then
master
garth
and
it
will
happen
all
the
sooner
you
ask
her
if
she
did
simpson
miss
gray
did
you
ever
learn
you
waking
call
me
early
call
me
early
mother
dear
i
always
hated
that
young
woman
i
should
think
in
her
excited
state
she
would
have
been
waking
long
before
her
poor
mother
who
must
have
been
worn
to
a
perfect
rag
making
all
the
hussy
may
overnight
simpson
had
waited
to
guide
him
to
his
place
at
the
table
then
he
removed
the
covers
and
left
the
room
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
garth
leaned
forward
and
with
unerring
accuracy
laid
the
opening
rose
upon
nurse
plate
roses
for
rosemary
he
said
wear
it
if
you
are
sure
the
young
man
would
not
object
i
have
been
thinking
about
him
and
the
aunt
i
wish
you
could
ask
them
both
here
instead
of
going
away
on
thursday
we
would
have
the
merriest
time
i
would
play
with
the
aunt
while
you
had
it
out
with
the
young
man
and
i
could
easily
keep
the
aunt
away
from
nooks
and
corners
because
my
hearing
is
sharper
than
any
aunt
eyes
could
be
and
if
you
gave
a
gentle
cough
i
would
promptly
clutch
hold
of
auntie
and
insist
upon
being
guided
in
the
opposite
direction
and
i
would
take
her
out
in
the
motor
and
you
and
the
young
man
could
have
the
gig
and
then
when
all
was
satisfactorily
settled
we
could
pack
them
off
home
and
be
by
ourselves
again
ah
miss
gray
do
send
for
them
instead
of
leaving
me
on
thursday
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
reprovingly
as
she
leaned
forward
and
touched
his
right
hand
with
the
rim
of
his
saucer
this
morning
has
gone
to
your
head
i
shall
send
for
margery
she
may
have
known
the
symptoms
of
old
it
is
not
that
said
garth
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
confidentially
something
is
going
to
happen
little
rosemary
whenever
i
feel
like
this
something
happens
the
first
time
it
occurred
about
years
ago
there
was
a
in
the
hall
when
i
ran
downstairs
i
have
never
forgotten
my
first
ride
on
that
the
fearful
joy
when
he
went
backward
the
awful
plunge
when
he
went
forward
and
the
proud
moment
when
it
was
possible
to
cease
clinging
to
the
leather
pommel
i
nearly
killed
the
cousin
who
pulled
out
his
tail
i
thrashed
him
then
and
there
with
the
tail
which
was
such
a
silly
thing
to
do
because
though
it
damaged
the
cousin
it
also
spoiled
the
tail
the
next
time
ah
but
i
am
boring
you
not
at
all
said
nurse
rosemary
politely
but
i
want
you
to
have
some
breakfast
and
the
letters
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
looked
so
brown
and
radiant
this
dear
delightful
boy
with
his
tie
and
yellow
rose
she
was
conscious
of
her
pallor
and
oppressive
earnestness
as
she
said
the
letters
will
be
here
oh
bother
the
letters
cried
garth
let
have
a
holiday
from
letters
on
may
day
you
shall
be
queen
of
the
may
and
margery
shall
be
the
old
mother
i
will
be
robin
with
the
breaking
heart
leaning
on
the
bridge
beneath
the
hazel
tree
and
simpson
can
be
the
lad
and
we
will
all
go
and
knots
of
flowers
and
buds
and
garlands
gay
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
you
really
must
be
sensible
or
i
shall
go
and
consult
margery
i
have
never
seen
you
in
such
a
mood
you
have
never
seen
me
on
a
day
when
something
was
going
to
happen
said
garth
and
nurse
rosemary
made
no
further
attempt
to
repress
him
after
breakfast
he
went
to
the
piano
and
played
and
music
so
infectiously
that
simpson
literally
tripped
as
he
cleared
the
table
and
nurse
rosemary
sitting
pale
and
preoccupied
with
a
pile
of
letters
before
her
had
hard
work
to
keep
her
feet
still
simpson
had
to
the
door
with
the
cloth
and
closed
it
after
him
nurse
rosemary
remarks
about
the
and
the
letters
had
remained
unanswered
shine
little
glowworm
glimmer
was
pealing
gaily
through
the
room
like
silver
bells
when
the
door
opened
and
old
margery
appeared
in
a
black
satin
apron
and
a
blue
print
sunbonnet
she
came
straight
to
the
piano
and
laid
her
hand
gently
on
garth
arm
master
garthie
she
said
on
this
lovely
may
morning
will
you
take
old
margery
up
into
the
woods
garth
hands
dropped
from
the
keys
of
course
i
will
margie
he
said
and
i
say
margie
something
is
going
to
happen
i
know
it
laddie
said
the
old
woman
tenderly
and
the
expression
with
which
she
looked
into
the
blind
face
filled
jane
eyes
with
tears
i
woke
with
it
too
master
garthie
and
now
we
will
go
into
the
woods
and
listen
to
the
earth
and
trees
and
flowers
and
they
will
tell
us
whether
it
is
for
joy
or
for
sorrow
come
my
own
laddie
garth
rose
as
in
a
dream
even
in
his
blindness
he
looked
so
young
and
so
beautiful
that
jane
watching
heart
stood
still
at
the
window
he
paused
where
is
that
secretary
person
he
said
vaguely
she
kept
trying
to
shut
me
up
i
know
she
did
laddie
said
old
margery
curtseying
apologetically
towards
jane
you
see
she
does
not
know
the
awakening
ah
does
she
thought
jane
as
they
disappeared
through
the
window
but
as
my
garth
has
gone
off
his
dear
head
and
been
taken
away
by
his
nurse
the
thing
that
is
going
to
happen
ca
happen
just
yet
and
jane
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
very
softly
ran
through
the
accompaniment
of
the
rosary
then
after
shading
her
eyes
on
the
terrace
and
making
sure
that
a
tall
white
figure
leaning
on
a
short
dark
one
had
almost
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
still
more
softly
she
sang
it
afterwards
she
went
for
a
tramp
on
the
moors
and
steadied
her
nerve
by
the
rapid
swing
of
her
walk
and
the
deep
inbreathing
of
that
glorious
air
once
or
twice
she
took
a
telegram
from
her
pocket
stood
still
and
read
it
then
tramped
on
to
the
wonder
of
the
words
special
license
easily
obtained
ah
the
license
might
be
easy
to
obtain
but
how
about
his
forgiveness
that
must
be
obtained
first
if
there
were
only
this
darling
boy
to
deal
with
in
his
white
flannels
and
yellow
roses
with
a
madness
in
his
veins
the
license
might
come
at
once
and
all
he
could
wish
should
happen
without
delay
but
this
is
a
passing
phase
of
garth
what
she
has
to
deal
with
is
the
man
who
calmly
said
i
accept
the
cross
and
walked
down
the
village
church
leaving
her
for
all
these
years
loving
her
as
he
loved
her
and
yet
leaving
her
without
word
or
sign
for
three
long
years
to
hire
was
the
confession
his
would
be
the
decision
and
somehow
it
did
not
surprise
her
when
she
came
down
to
luncheon
a
little
late
to
find
him
seated
at
the
table
miss
gray
he
said
gravely
as
he
heard
her
enter
i
must
apologise
for
my
behaviour
this
morning
i
was
what
they
call
up
here
margery
understands
the
mood
and
together
she
and
i
have
listened
to
kind
mother
earth
laying
our
hands
on
her
sympathetic
softness
and
she
has
told
us
her
secrets
then
i
lay
down
under
the
fir
trees
and
slept
and
awakened
calm
and
sane
and
ready
for
what
must
bring
for
it
will
bring
something
that
is
no
delusion
it
is
a
day
of
great
things
that
much
margery
knows
too
perhaps
suggested
nurse
rosemary
tentatively
there
may
be
news
of
interest
in
your
letters
ah
said
garth
i
forgot
we
have
not
even
opened
this
letters
let
us
take
time
for
them
immediately
after
lunch
are
there
many
quite
a
pile
said
nurse
rosemary
good
we
will
work
soberly
through
them
half
an
hour
later
garth
was
seated
in
his
chair
calm
and
expectant
his
face
turned
towards
his
secretary
he
had
handled
his
letters
and
amongst
them
he
had
found
one
sealed
and
the
seal
was
a
plumed
helmet
with
visor
closed
nurse
rosemary
saw
him
pale
as
his
fingers
touched
it
he
made
no
remark
but
as
before
slipped
it
beneath
the
rest
that
it
might
come
up
for
reading
last
of
all
when
the
others
were
finished
and
nurse
rosemary
took
up
this
letter
the
room
was
very
still
they
were
quite
alone
bees
hummed
in
the
garden
the
scent
of
flowers
stole
in
at
the
window
but
no
one
disturbed
their
solitude
nurse
rosemary
took
up
the
envelope
dalmain
here
is
a
letter
sealed
with
scarlet
wax
the
seal
is
a
helmet
with
visor
i
know
said
garth
you
need
not
describe
it
further
kindly
open
it
nurse
rosemary
opened
it
it
is
a
very
long
letter
mr
dalmain
indeed
will
you
please
read
it
to
me
miss
gray
a
tense
moment
of
silence
followed
nurse
rosemary
lifted
the
letter
but
her
voice
suddenly
refused
to
respond
to
her
will
garth
waited
without
further
word
then
nurse
rosemary
said
indeed
sir
it
seems
a
most
private
letter
i
find
it
difficult
to
read
it
to
you
garth
heard
the
distress
in
her
voice
and
turned
to
her
kindly
never
mind
my
dear
child
it
in
no
way
concerns
you
it
is
a
private
letter
to
me
but
my
only
means
of
hearing
it
is
through
your
eyes
and
from
your
lips
besides
the
lady
whose
seal
is
a
plumed
helmet
can
have
nothing
of
a
very
private
nature
to
say
to
me
ah
but
she
has
said
nurse
rosemary
brokenly
garth
considered
this
in
silence
then
turn
over
the
page
he
said
and
tell
me
the
signature
there
are
many
pages
said
nurse
rosemary
turn
over
the
pages
then
said
garth
sternly
do
not
keep
me
waiting
how
is
that
letter
signed
your
wife
whispered
nurse
rosemary
there
was
a
petrifying
quality
about
the
silence
which
followed
it
seemed
as
if
those
two
words
whispered
into
garth
darkness
had
turned
him
to
stone
at
last
he
stretched
out
his
hand
will
you
give
me
that
letter
if
you
please
miss
gray
thank
you
i
wish
to
be
alone
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
sit
in
the
and
stop
any
one
from
coming
into
this
room
i
must
be
undisturbed
at
the
end
of
that
time
kindly
return
he
spoke
so
quietly
that
jane
heart
sank
within
her
some
display
of
agitation
would
have
been
reassuring
this
was
the
man
who
bowing
his
dark
head
towards
the
crucifixion
window
said
i
accept
the
cross
this
was
the
man
whose
footsteps
never
once
faltered
as
he
strode
down
the
aisle
and
left
her
this
was
the
man
who
had
had
the
strength
ever
since
to
treat
that
episode
between
her
and
himself
as
completely
closed
no
word
of
entreaty
no
sign
of
remembrance
no
hint
of
reproach
and
this
was
the
man
to
whom
she
had
signed
herself
your
wife
in
her
whole
life
jane
had
never
known
fear
she
knew
it
now
as
she
silently
rose
and
left
him
she
stole
one
look
at
his
face
he
was
sitting
perfectly
still
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
had
not
turned
his
head
toward
her
as
he
took
it
his
profile
might
have
been
a
beautiful
carving
in
white
ivory
there
was
not
the
faintest
tinge
of
colour
in
his
face
just
that
ivory
pallor
against
the
ebony
lines
of
his
straight
brows
and
smooth
dark
hair
jane
softly
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
then
followed
the
longest
fifteen
minutes
she
had
ever
known
she
realised
what
a
tremendous
conflict
was
in
progress
in
that
quiet
room
garth
was
arriving
at
his
decision
without
having
heard
any
of
her
arguments
by
the
strange
fatality
of
his
own
insistence
he
had
heard
only
two
words
of
her
letter
and
those
the
crucial
words
the
two
words
to
which
the
whole
letter
carefully
led
up
they
must
have
revealed
to
him
instantly
what
the
character
of
the
letter
would
be
and
what
was
the
attitude
of
mind
towards
himself
of
the
woman
who
wrote
them
jane
paced
the
in
desperation
remembering
the
hours
of
thought
which
had
gone
to
the
compiling
of
sentences
cautiously
preparing
his
mind
to
the
revelation
of
the
signature
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
her
mental
perturbation
there
came
to
her
the
remembrance
of
a
conversation
between
nurse
rosemary
and
garth
over
the
pictures
the
former
had
said
is
she
a
wife
and
garth
had
answered
yes
jane
had
instantly
understood
what
that
answer
revealed
and
implied
because
garth
had
so
felt
her
his
during
those
wonderful
moments
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
that
he
could
look
up
into
her
face
and
say
my
wife
not
as
an
interrogation
but
as
an
absolute
statement
of
fact
he
still
held
her
this
as
indissolubly
as
if
priest
and
book
and
ring
had
gone
to
the
wedding
of
their
union
to
him
the
union
of
souls
came
before
all
else
and
if
that
had
taken
place
all
that
might
follow
was
but
the
outward
indorsement
of
an
accomplished
fact
owing
to
her
fear
mistrust
and
deception
nothing
had
followed
their
lives
had
been
sundered
they
had
gone
different
ways
he
regarded
himself
as
being
no
more
to
her
than
any
other
man
of
her
acquaintance
during
these
years
he
had
believed
that
her
part
in
that
evening
wedding
of
souls
had
existed
in
his
imagination
only
and
had
no
binding
effect
upon
her
but
his
remained
because
those
words
were
true
to
him
then
he
had
said
them
and
because
he
had
said
them
he
would
consider
her
his
wife
through
life
and
after
it
was
the
intuitive
understanding
of
this
which
had
emboldened
jane
so
to
sign
her
letter
but
how
would
he
reconcile
that
signature
with
the
view
of
her
conduct
which
he
had
all
along
taken
without
ever
having
the
slightest
conception
that
there
could
be
any
other
then
jane
remembered
with
comfort
the
irresistible
appeal
made
by
truth
to
the
soul
of
the
artist
truth
of
line
truth
of
colour
truth
of
values
and
in
the
realm
of
sound
truth
of
tone
of
harmony
of
rendering
of
conception
and
when
nurse
rosemary
had
said
of
his
painting
of
the
wife
it
is
a
triumph
of
art
garth
had
replied
it
is
a
triumph
of
truth
and
jane
own
verdict
on
the
look
he
had
seen
and
depicted
was
it
is
true
yes
it
is
true
will
he
not
realise
now
the
truth
of
that
signature
and
if
he
realises
it
will
he
not
be
glad
in
his
loneliness
that
his
wife
should
come
to
him
unless
the
confessions
and
admissions
of
the
letter
cause
him
to
put
her
away
as
wholly
unworthy
suddenly
jane
understood
the
immense
advantage
of
the
fact
that
he
would
hear
every
word
of
the
rest
of
her
letter
knowing
the
conclusion
which
she
herself
could
not
possibly
have
put
first
she
saw
a
higher
hand
in
this
arrangement
and
said
as
she
watched
the
minutes
slowly
pass
he
hath
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
partition
between
us
and
a
sense
of
calm
assurance
descended
and
garrisoned
her
soul
with
peace
the
quarter
of
an
hour
was
over
jane
crossed
the
hall
with
firm
though
noiseless
step
stood
a
moment
on
the
threshold
relegating
herself
completely
to
the
background
then
opened
the
door
and
nurse
rosemary
the
library
chapter
xxxiv
love
never
faileth
garth
was
standing
at
the
open
window
when
nurse
rosemary
the
library
and
he
did
not
turn
immediately
she
looked
anxiously
for
the
letter
and
saw
it
laid
ready
on
her
side
of
the
table
it
bore
signs
of
having
been
much
crumpled
looking
almost
as
a
letter
might
appear
which
had
been
crushed
into
a
ball
flung
into
the
basket
and
afterwards
retrieved
it
had
however
been
carefully
smoothed
out
and
lay
ready
to
her
hand
when
garth
turned
from
the
window
and
passed
to
his
chair
his
face
bore
the
signs
of
a
great
struggle
he
looked
as
one
who
sightless
has
yet
been
making
frantic
efforts
to
see
the
ivory
pallor
was
gone
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
thick
hair
which
grew
in
beautiful
curves
low
upon
his
forehead
and
temples
and
was
usually
carefully
brushed
back
in
neatness
was
now
ruffled
and
disordered
but
his
voice
was
completely
under
control
as
he
turned
towards
his
secretary
my
dear
miss
gray
he
said
we
have
a
difficult
task
before
us
i
have
received
a
letter
which
it
is
essential
i
should
hear
i
am
obliged
to
ask
you
to
read
it
to
me
because
there
is
absolutely
no
one
else
to
whom
i
can
prefer
such
a
request
i
can
not
but
know
that
it
will
be
a
difficult
and
painful
task
for
you
feeling
yourself
an
intermediary
between
two
wounded
and
sundered
hearts
may
i
make
it
easier
my
dear
little
girl
by
assuring
you
that
i
know
of
no
one
in
this
world
from
whose
lips
i
could
listen
to
the
contents
of
that
letter
with
less
pain
and
failing
my
own
there
are
no
eyes
beneath
which
i
could
less
grudgingly
let
it
pass
there
is
no
mind
i
could
so
unquestioningly
trust
to
judge
kindly
both
of
myself
and
of
the
writer
and
to
forget
faithfully
all
which
was
not
intended
to
come
within
the
knowledge
of
a
third
person
thank
you
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
garth
leaned
back
in
his
chair
shielding
his
face
with
his
hand
now
if
you
please
he
said
and
very
clearly
and
quietly
nurse
rosemary
began
to
read
dear
garth
as
you
will
not
let
me
come
to
you
so
that
i
could
say
between
you
and
me
alone
that
which
must
be
said
i
am
compelled
to
write
it
it
is
your
own
fault
dal
and
we
both
pay
the
penalty
for
how
can
i
write
to
you
freely
when
i
know
that
as
you
listen
it
will
seem
to
you
of
every
word
i
am
writing
that
i
am
dragging
a
third
person
into
that
which
ought
to
be
most
sacredly
between
you
and
me
alone
and
yet
i
must
write
freely
and
i
must
make
you
fully
understand
because
the
whole
of
your
future
life
and
mine
will
depend
upon
your
reply
to
this
letter
i
must
write
as
if
you
were
able
to
hold
the
letter
in
your
own
hands
and
read
it
to
yourself
therefore
if
you
can
not
completely
trust
your
secretary
with
the
private
history
of
your
heart
and
mine
bid
her
give
it
you
back
without
turning
this
first
page
and
let
me
come
myself
garth
and
tell
you
all
the
rest
that
is
the
bottom
of
the
page
said
nurse
rosemary
and
waited
garth
did
not
remove
his
hand
i
do
completely
trust
and
she
must
not
come
he
said
nurse
rosemary
turned
the
page
and
went
on
reading
i
want
you
to
remember
garth
that
every
word
i
write
is
the
simple
unvarnished
truth
if
you
look
back
over
your
remembrance
of
me
you
will
admit
that
i
am
not
naturally
an
untruthful
person
nor
did
i
ever
take
easily
to
prevarication
but
garth
i
told
you
one
lie
and
that
fatal
exception
proves
the
rule
of
perfect
truthfulness
which
has
always
otherwise
held
between
you
and
me
and
please
god
always
will
hold
the
confession
herein
contained
concerns
that
one
lie
and
i
need
not
ask
you
to
realise
how
humbling
it
is
to
my
pride
to
have
to
force
the
hearing
of
a
confession
upon
the
man
who
has
already
refused
to
admit
me
to
a
visit
of
friendship
you
will
remember
that
i
am
not
naturally
humble
and
have
a
considerable
amount
of
proper
pride
and
perhaps
by
the
greatness
of
the
effort
i
have
had
to
make
you
will
be
able
to
gauge
the
greatness
of
my
love
god
help
you
to
do
so
my
darling
my
beloved
my
poor
desolate
boy
nurse
rosemary
stopped
abruptly
for
at
this
sudden
mention
of
love
and
at
these
words
of
unexpected
tenderness
from
jane
garth
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
taken
two
steps
towards
the
window
as
if
to
escape
from
something
too
immense
to
be
faced
but
in
a
moment
he
recovered
himself
and
sat
down
again
completely
hiding
his
face
with
his
hand
nurse
rosemary
resumed
the
reading
of
the
letter
ah
what
a
wrong
i
have
done
both
to
you
and
to
myself
dear
you
remember
the
evening
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
when
you
asked
me
to
be
when
you
called
me
when
i
was
your
wife
garth
i
leave
this
last
sentence
as
it
stands
with
its
two
attempts
to
reach
the
truth
i
will
not
cross
them
out
but
leave
them
to
be
read
to
you
for
you
see
garth
i
finally
arrived
i
was
your
wife
i
did
not
understand
it
then
i
was
intensely
surprised
unbelievably
inexperienced
in
matters
of
feeling
and
bewildered
by
the
flood
of
sensation
which
swept
me
off
my
feet
and
almost
engulfed
me
but
even
then
i
knew
that
my
soul
arose
and
proclaimed
you
mate
and
master
and
when
you
held
me
and
your
dear
head
lay
upon
my
heart
i
knew
for
the
first
time
the
meaning
of
the
word
ecstasy
and
i
could
have
asked
no
kinder
gift
of
heaven
than
to
prolong
those
moments
into
hours
nurse
rosemary
quiet
voice
broke
suddenly
and
the
reading
ceased
garth
was
leaning
forward
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
a
dry
sob
rose
in
his
throat
just
at
the
very
moment
when
nurse
rosemary
voice
gave
way
garth
recovered
first
without
lifting
his
head
with
a
gesture
of
protective
affection
and
sympathy
he
stretched
his
hand
across
the
table
poor
little
girl
he
said
i
am
so
sorry
it
is
rough
on
you
if
only
it
had
come
when
brand
was
here
i
am
afraid
you
must
go
on
but
try
to
read
without
realising
leave
the
realising
to
me
and
nurse
rosemary
read
on
when
you
lifted
your
head
in
the
moonlight
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
me
ah
those
dear
eyes
your
look
suddenly
made
me
there
swept
over
me
a
sense
of
my
own
exceeding
plainness
and
of
how
little
there
was
in
what
those
dear
eyes
saw
to
provide
reason
for
that
adoring
look
overwhelmed
with
a
shy
shame
i
pressed
your
head
back
to
the
place
where
the
eyes
would
be
hidden
and
i
realise
now
what
a
different
construction
you
must
have
put
upon
that
action
garth
i
assure
you
that
when
you
lifted
your
head
the
second
time
and
said
wife
it
was
the
first
suggestion
to
my
mind
that
this
wonderful
thing
which
was
happening
meant
marriage
i
know
it
must
seem
almost
incredible
and
more
like
a
child
of
eighteen
than
a
woman
of
thirty
but
you
must
remember
all
my
dealings
with
men
up
to
that
hour
had
been
handshakes
heartiest
comradeship
and
an
occasional
clap
on
the
shoulder
given
and
received
and
do
forget
dear
king
of
my
heart
that
until
one
short
week
before
you
had
been
amongst
the
boys
who
called
me
old
jane
and
addressed
me
in
intimate
conversation
as
dear
fellow
do
forget
that
i
had
always
looked
upon
you
as
years
younger
than
myself
and
though
a
strangely
sweet
tie
had
grown
up
between
us
since
the
evening
of
the
concert
at
overdene
i
had
never
realised
it
as
love
well
you
will
remember
how
i
asked
for
twelve
hours
to
consider
my
answer
and
you
yielded
immediately
you
were
so
perfect
all
the
time
garth
and
left
me
when
i
asked
to
be
alone
left
me
with
a
gesture
i
have
never
forgotten
it
was
a
revelation
of
the
way
in
which
the
love
of
a
man
such
as
you
exalts
the
woman
upon
whom
it
is
outpoured
the
hem
of
that
gown
has
been
a
sacred
thing
to
me
ever
since
it
is
always
with
me
though
i
never
wear
a
detailed
account
of
the
hours
which
followed
i
shall
hope
to
give
you
some
day
my
dearest
i
can
not
write
it
let
me
hurl
on
to
paper
in
all
its
crude
ugliness
the
miserable
fact
which
parted
us
turning
our
dawning
joy
to
disillusion
and
sadness
garth
it
was
this
i
did
not
believe
your
love
would
stand
the
test
of
my
plainness
i
knew
what
a
worshipper
of
beauty
you
were
how
you
must
have
it
in
one
form
or
another
always
around
you
i
got
out
my
diary
in
which
i
had
recorded
verbatim
our
conversation
about
the
ugly
preacher
whose
face
became
illumined
into
beauty
by
the
inspired
glory
within
and
you
added
that
you
never
thought
him
ugly
again
but
he
would
always
be
plain
and
you
said
it
was
not
the
sort
of
face
one
would
want
to
have
always
before
one
at
meals
but
that
you
were
not
called
upon
to
undergo
that
discipline
which
would
be
sheer
martyrdom
to
you
i
was
so
interested
at
the
time
and
so
amused
at
the
unconscious
way
in
which
you
stood
and
explained
this
to
quite
the
plainest
woman
of
your
acquaintance
that
i
recorded
it
very
fully
in
my
alas
on
that
important
night
i
read
the
words
over
and
over
until
they
took
morbid
hold
upon
my
brain
then
such
is
the
awakened
in
a
woman
by
the
fact
that
she
is
loved
and
sought
i
turned
on
all
the
lights
around
my
mirror
and
critically
and
carefully
examined
the
face
you
would
have
to
see
every
day
behind
your
at
breakfast
for
years
and
years
if
i
said
on
the
morrow
darling
i
did
not
see
myself
through
your
eyes
as
thank
god
i
have
done
since
and
i
did
not
trust
your
love
to
stand
the
test
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
saving
both
of
us
from
future
disappointment
and
misery
by
bravely
putting
away
present
joy
in
order
to
avoid
certain
disenchantment
my
beloved
it
will
seem
to
you
so
coolly
calculating
and
so
mean
so
unworthy
of
the
great
love
you
were
even
then
lavishing
upon
me
but
remember
for
years
your
remarkable
personal
grace
and
beauty
had
been
a
source
of
pleasure
to
me
and
i
had
pictured
you
wedded
to
pauline
lister
for
instance
in
her
dazzling
whiteness
and
soft
radiant
youth
so
my
morbid
said
this
young
apollo
tied
to
my
ponderous
plainness
growing
handsomer
every
year
while
i
grow
older
and
plainer
ah
darling
it
sounds
so
unworthy
now
we
know
what
our
love
is
but
it
sounded
sensible
and
right
that
night
and
at
last
with
a
bosom
that
ached
and
arms
that
hung
heavy
at
the
thought
of
being
emptied
of
all
that
joy
i
made
up
my
mind
to
say
ah
believe
me
i
had
no
idea
what
it
already
meant
to
you
i
thought
you
would
pass
on
at
once
to
another
fancy
and
transfer
your
love
to
one
more
able
to
meet
your
needs
at
every
point
honestly
garth
i
thought
i
should
be
the
only
one
left
then
came
the
question
how
to
refuse
you
i
knew
if
i
gave
the
true
reason
you
would
argue
it
away
and
prove
me
wrong
with
glowing
words
before
which
i
should
perforce
yield
so
as
i
really
meant
not
to
let
you
run
the
risk
and
not
to
run
it
myself
i
lied
to
you
my
beloved
to
you
whom
my
whole
being
acclaimed
king
of
my
heart
master
of
my
will
supreme
to
me
in
love
and
life
to
you
i
said
can
not
marry
a
mere
boy
ah
darling
i
do
not
excuse
it
i
do
not
defend
it
i
merely
confess
it
trusting
to
your
generosity
to
admit
that
no
other
answer
would
have
sent
you
away
ah
your
poor
jane
left
desolate
if
you
could
have
seen
her
in
the
little
church
calling
you
back
retracting
and
promising
listening
for
your
returning
footsteps
in
an
agony
of
longing
but
my
garth
is
not
made
of
the
stuff
which
stands
waiting
on
the
of
a
indecision
the
lonely
year
which
followed
so
broke
my
nerve
that
deryck
brand
told
me
i
was
going
all
to
pieces
and
ordered
me
abroad
i
went
as
you
know
and
in
other
and
more
vigorous
surroundings
there
came
to
me
a
saner
view
of
life
in
egypt
last
march
on
the
summit
of
the
great
pyramid
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
live
without
you
no
longer
i
did
not
see
myself
wrong
but
i
yearned
so
for
your
love
and
to
pour
mine
upon
you
my
beloved
that
i
concluded
it
was
worth
the
risk
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
the
next
boat
home
and
send
for
you
then
oh
my
own
boy
i
heard
i
wrote
to
you
and
you
would
not
let
me
come
now
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
might
say
did
not
trust
me
when
i
had
my
sight
now
that
i
can
not
see
she
is
no
longer
afraid
garth
you
might
say
that
but
it
would
not
be
true
i
have
had
ample
proof
lately
that
i
was
wrong
and
ought
to
have
trusted
you
all
through
what
it
is
i
will
tell
you
later
all
i
can
say
now
is
that
if
your
dear
shining
eyes
could
see
they
would
see
now
a
woman
who
is
trustfully
and
unquestioningly
all
your
own
if
she
is
doubtful
of
her
face
and
figure
she
says
quite
simply
pleased
him
and
they
are
just
his
i
have
no
further
right
to
criticise
them
if
he
wants
them
they
are
not
mine
but
his
darling
i
can
not
tell
you
now
how
i
have
arrived
at
this
assurance
but
i
have
had
proofs
beyond
words
of
your
faithfulness
and
love
the
question
therefore
simply
resolves
itself
into
this
can
you
forgive
me
if
you
can
forgive
me
i
can
come
to
you
at
once
if
this
thing
is
past
forgiveness
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
stay
away
but
oh
my
own
dear
the
bosom
on
which
once
you
laid
your
head
waits
for
you
with
the
longing
ache
of
lonely
years
if
you
need
it
do
not
thrust
it
from
you
write
me
one
word
by
your
own
hand
it
is
all
i
ask
when
it
reaches
me
i
will
come
to
you
at
once
do
not
dictate
a
letter
to
your
secretary
i
could
not
bear
it
just
write
if
you
can
truly
write
it
and
send
it
to
wife
the
room
was
very
still
as
nurse
rosemary
finished
reading
and
laying
down
the
letter
silently
waited
she
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
she
could
get
herself
a
glass
of
water
without
disturbing
him
but
decided
to
do
without
it
at
last
garth
lifted
his
head
she
has
asked
me
to
do
a
thing
impossible
he
said
and
a
slow
smile
illumined
his
drawn
face
jane
clasped
her
hands
upon
her
breast
can
you
not
write
asked
nurse
rosemary
brokenly
no
said
garth
i
can
not
little
girl
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
pencil
nurse
rosemary
placed
them
close
to
his
hand
garth
took
up
the
pencil
he
groped
for
the
paper
felt
the
edges
with
his
left
hand
found
the
centre
with
his
fingers
and
in
large
firm
letters
wrote
one
word
is
that
legible
he
asked
passing
it
across
to
nurse
rosemary
quite
legible
she
said
for
she
answered
before
it
was
blotted
by
her
tears
instead
of
forgiven
garth
had
written
loved
can
you
post
it
at
once
garth
asked
in
a
low
eager
voice
and
she
will
come
oh
my
god
she
will
come
if
we
catch
mail
she
may
be
here
the
day
after
nurse
rosemary
took
up
the
letter
and
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
spoke
steadily
dalmain
she
said
there
is
a
postscript
to
this
letter
it
says
to
the
palace
hotel
aberdeen
garth
sprang
up
his
whole
face
and
figure
alive
with
excitement
in
aberdeen
he
cried
jane
in
aberdeen
oh
my
god
if
she
gets
this
paper
morning
she
may
be
here
any
time
in
the
day
jane
jane
dear
little
rosemary
do
you
hear
jane
will
come
did
i
tell
you
something
was
going
to
happen
you
and
simpson
were
too
british
to
understand
but
margery
knew
and
the
woods
told
us
it
was
joy
coming
through
pain
could
that
be
posted
at
once
miss
gray
the
mood
was
upon
him
again
his
face
shone
his
figure
was
electric
with
expectation
nurse
rosemary
sat
at
the
table
watching
him
her
chin
in
her
hands
a
tender
smile
dawned
on
her
lips
out
of
keeping
with
her
supposed
face
and
figure
so
full
was
it
of
the
glorious
expectation
of
a
mature
and
perfect
love
i
will
go
to
the
myself
dalmain
she
said
i
shall
be
glad
of
the
walk
and
i
can
be
back
by
at
the
she
did
not
post
the
word
in
garth
handwriting
that
lay
hidden
in
her
bosom
but
she
sent
off
two
telegrams
the
first
to
the
duchess
of
meldyum
palace
hotel
aberdeen
come
here
by
train
without
fail
this
evening
the
second
to
sir
deryck
brand
wimpole
sheet
london
all
is
right
chapter
xxxv
nurse
rosemary
has
her
reward
dalmain
said
nurse
rosemary
with
patient
insistence
i
really
do
want
you
to
sit
down
and
give
your
mind
to
the
how
can
you
remember
where
each
thing
is
placed
if
you
keep
jumping
up
and
moving
your
chair
into
different
positions
and
last
time
you
pounded
the
table
to
attract
my
attention
which
was
already
anxiously
fixed
upon
you
you
nearly
knocked
over
your
own
tea
and
sent
floods
of
mine
into
the
saucer
if
you
can
not
behave
better
i
shall
ask
margery
for
a
pinafore
and
sit
you
up
on
a
high
chair
garth
stretched
his
legs
in
front
of
him
and
his
arms
over
his
head
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
laughing
joyously
then
i
should
have
to
say
nurse
may
i
get
down
what
a
cheeky
little
thing
you
are
becoming
and
you
used
to
be
quite
oppressively
polite
i
suppose
you
would
answer
you
say
your
grace
nicely
master
garth
you
may
do
you
know
the
story
of
you
should
say
your
grace
you
have
told
it
to
me
twice
in
the
last
hours
said
nurse
rosemary
patiently
oh
what
a
pity
i
felt
so
like
telling
it
now
if
you
had
really
been
the
sort
of
sympathetic
person
sir
deryck
described
you
would
have
said
and
i
should
so
love
to
hear
it
no
and
i
should
so
love
to
hear
it
said
nurse
rosemary
too
late
that
sort
of
thing
to
have
any
value
should
be
spontaneous
it
need
not
be
true
but
it
must
be
spontaneous
but
talking
of
a
high
chair
when
you
say
those
chaffy
things
in
a
voice
like
jane
and
just
as
jane
would
have
said
them
oh
my
wig
do
you
know
that
is
the
duchess
only
original
little
swear
all
the
rest
are
quotations
and
when
she
says
wig
we
all
try
not
to
look
at
it
it
is
usually
slightly
awry
the
toucan
tweaks
it
he
is
so
very
loving
dear
bird
now
hand
me
the
buttered
toast
said
nurse
rosemary
and
do
tell
me
any
more
naughty
stories
about
the
duchess
no
that
is
the
thin
i
told
you
you
would
lose
your
bearings
the
toast
is
in
a
warm
plate
on
your
right
now
let
us
make
believe
i
am
miss
champion
and
hand
it
to
me
as
nicely
as
you
will
be
handing
it
to
her
this
time
it
is
easy
to
make
believe
you
are
jane
with
that
voice
said
garth
and
yet
i
do
know
i
have
never
really
associated
you
with
her
one
little
sentence
of
old
rob
made
all
the
difference
to
me
he
said
you
had
fluffy
sort
of
hair
no
one
could
ever
imagine
jane
with
fluffy
sort
of
hair
and
i
believe
that
one
sentence
saved
the
situation
otherwise
your
voice
would
have
driven
me
mad
those
first
days
as
it
was
i
used
to
wonder
sometimes
if
i
could
possibly
bear
it
you
understand
why
now
do
you
and
yet
in
a
way
it
is
not
like
hers
hers
is
deeper
and
she
often
speaks
with
a
delicious
kind
of
drawl
and
uses
heaps
of
slang
and
you
are
such
a
very
proper
little
person
and
possess
what
the
primers
call
correct
diction
what
fun
it
would
be
to
hear
you
and
jane
talk
together
and
yet
i
do
know
i
should
be
on
thorns
all
the
time
why
i
should
be
so
awfully
afraid
lest
you
should
not
like
one
another
you
see
you
have
really
in
a
way
been
more
to
me
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
she
well
she
is
my
world
said
garth
simply
and
i
should
be
so
afraid
lest
she
should
not
fully
appreciate
you
and
you
should
not
quite
understand
her
she
has
a
sort
of
way
of
standing
and
looking
people
up
and
down
and
women
hate
it
especially
pretty
fluffy
little
women
they
feel
she
spots
all
the
things
that
come
off
nothing
of
mine
comes
off
murmured
nurse
rosemary
excepting
my
patient
when
he
will
not
stay
on
his
chair
once
continued
garth
with
the
gleeful
enjoyment
in
his
voice
which
always
presaged
a
story
in
which
jane
figured
there
was
a
fearfully
silly
little
woman
staying
at
overdene
when
a
lot
of
us
were
there
we
never
could
make
out
why
she
was
included
in
one
of
the
duchess
parties
except
that
the
dear
duchess
vastly
enjoyed
taking
her
off
and
telling
stories
about
her
and
we
could
not
appreciate
the
cleverness
of
the
impersonation
unless
we
had
seen
the
original
she
was
rather
pretty
in
a
fussy
sort
of
way
but
she
never
could
let
her
appearance
alone
or
allow
people
to
forget
it
almost
every
sentence
she
spoke
drew
attention
to
it
we
got
very
sick
of
it
and
asked
jane
to
make
her
shut
up
but
jane
said
hurt
you
boys
and
it
pleases
her
let
her
be
jane
was
always
extra
nice
to
people
if
she
suspected
they
were
asked
down
in
order
to
make
sport
for
the
duchess
afterwards
jane
hated
that
sort
of
thing
she
could
say
much
to
her
aunt
but
we
had
to
be
very
careful
how
we
egged
the
duchess
on
if
jane
was
within
hearing
well
one
evening
after
tea
a
little
group
of
us
were
waiting
around
the
fire
in
the
lower
hall
to
talk
to
jane
it
was
christmas
time
the
logs
looked
so
jolly
on
the
hearth
the
red
velvet
curtains
were
drawn
right
across
covering
the
terrace
door
and
the
windows
on
either
side
tommy
sat
on
his
perch
in
the
centre
of
the
group
keeping
a
keen
lookout
for
cigarette
ends
outside
the
world
was
deep
in
snow
and
that
wonderful
silence
reigned
making
the
talk
and
laughter
within
all
the
more
gay
by
contrast
you
know
that
penetrating
silence
when
trees
and
fields
and
paths
are
covered
a
foot
thick
in
soft
sparkling
whiteness
i
always
look
forward
just
as
eagerly
each
winter
to
the
first
sight
ah
i
forgot
fancy
never
seeing
snow
again
never
mind
it
is
something
to
remember
having
seen
it
and
i
shall
hear
the
wonderful
more
clearly
than
ever
perhaps
before
other
people
pull
up
the
blinds
i
shall
be
able
to
say
been
a
fall
of
snow
in
the
night
what
was
i
telling
you
yes
i
remember
about
little
fussy
well
all
the
women
had
gone
up
to
dress
for
dinner
excepting
jane
who
never
needed
more
than
half
an
hour
and
fussy
who
was
being
sprightly
in
a
laboured
way
and
fancied
herself
the
centre
of
attraction
which
kept
us
congregated
in
the
hall
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
waiting
to
tell
jane
some
private
news
we
had
just
heard
about
a
young
chap
in
the
guards
who
was
in
fearful
hot
water
for
ragging
his
colonel
was
an
old
friend
of
jane
and
we
thought
she
could
put
in
a
word
and
improve
matters
for
billy
so
fussy
was
very
much
de
trop
and
did
know
it
jane
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
all
of
us
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
her
skirt
turned
up
over
her
knees
oh
there
was
another
one
underneath
a
handsome
silk
thing
with
rows
of
little
frills
which
you
would
think
should
have
gone
on
outside
but
jane
best
things
are
never
paraded
always
hidden
i
do
mean
clothes
now
but
her
splendid
self
well
little
fussy
was
she
never
talked
about
herself
and
her
conquests
quite
unconscious
that
we
all
wished
her
at
jericho
jane
went
on
reading
the
evening
paper
but
she
felt
the
atmosphere
growing
restive
presently
ah
but
i
must
not
tell
you
the
rest
i
have
just
remembered
jane
made
us
promise
never
to
repeat
it
she
thought
it
detrimental
to
the
other
woman
but
we
just
had
time
for
our
confab
and
jane
caught
the
evening
post
with
the
letter
which
got
billy
off
and
yet
came
down
punctually
to
dinner
better
dressed
than
any
of
them
we
felt
it
rather
hard
luck
to
have
to
promise
because
we
had
each
counted
on
being
the
first
to
tell
the
story
to
the
duchess
but
you
know
you
always
have
to
do
as
jane
says
why
oh
i
do
know
i
ca
explain
why
if
you
knew
her
you
would
not
need
to
ask
cake
miss
gray
thank
you
right
this
time
there
that
is
exactly
as
jane
would
have
said
this
time
is
it
not
strange
that
after
having
for
weeks
thought
your
voice
so
like
hers
i
shall
be
thinking
her
voice
so
like
yours
oh
no
you
will
not
said
nurse
rosemary
when
she
is
with
you
you
will
have
no
thoughts
for
other
people
indeed
but
i
shall
cried
garth
and
dear
little
rosemary
i
shall
miss
you
horribly
no
one
not
even
she
can
take
your
place
and
do
you
know
he
leaned
forward
and
a
troubled
look
clouded
the
gladness
of
his
face
i
am
beginning
to
feel
anxious
about
it
she
has
not
seen
me
since
the
accident
i
am
afraid
it
will
give
her
a
shock
do
you
think
she
will
find
me
much
changed
jane
looked
at
the
sightless
face
turned
so
anxiously
toward
her
she
remembered
that
morning
in
his
room
when
he
thought
himself
alone
with
dr
rob
and
leaving
the
shelter
of
the
wall
sat
up
to
speak
and
she
saw
his
face
for
the
first
time
she
remembered
turning
to
the
fireplace
so
that
dr
rob
should
not
see
the
tears
raining
down
her
cheeks
she
looked
again
at
garth
now
growing
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
his
disfigurement
and
then
only
for
her
sake
and
an
almost
overwhelming
tenderness
gripped
her
heart
she
glanced
at
the
clock
she
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
is
it
very
bad
said
garth
and
his
voice
shook
i
can
not
answer
for
another
woman
replied
nurse
rosemary
but
i
should
think
your
face
just
as
it
is
will
always
be
her
joy
garth
flushed
pleased
and
relieved
but
slightly
surprised
there
was
a
quality
in
nurse
rosemary
voice
for
which
he
could
not
altogether
account
but
then
she
will
not
be
accustomed
to
my
blind
ways
he
continued
i
am
afraid
i
shall
seem
so
helpless
and
so
blundering
she
has
not
been
in
sightless
land
as
you
and
i
have
been
she
does
not
know
all
our
plans
of
cords
and
notches
and
things
ah
little
rosemary
promise
not
to
leave
me
i
want
her
only
god
knows
how
i
want
her
but
i
begin
to
be
half
afraid
it
will
be
so
wonderful
for
the
great
essentials
but
for
the
little
happenings
which
are
so
magnified
by
the
darkness
oh
my
kind
unseen
guide
how
i
shall
need
you
at
first
i
thought
it
lucky
you
had
settled
to
go
just
when
she
is
coming
but
now
just
because
she
is
coming
i
can
not
let
you
go
having
her
will
be
wonderful
beyond
words
but
it
will
not
be
the
same
as
having
you
nurse
rosemary
was
receiving
her
reward
and
she
appeared
to
find
it
rather
overwhelming
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
gently
do
excite
yourself
over
it
dalmain
believe
me
when
you
have
been
with
her
for
five
minutes
you
will
find
it
just
the
same
as
having
me
and
how
do
you
know
she
has
not
also
been
in
sightless
land
a
nurse
would
do
that
sort
of
thing
because
she
was
very
keen
on
her
profession
and
on
making
a
success
of
her
case
the
woman
who
loves
you
would
do
it
for
love
of
you
it
would
be
like
her
said
garth
and
leaned
back
a
look
of
deep
contentment
gathering
on
his
face
oh
jane
jane
she
is
coming
she
is
coming
nurse
rosemary
looked
at
the
clock
yes
she
is
coming
she
said
and
though
her
voice
was
steady
her
hands
trembled
and
as
it
is
our
last
evening
together
under
quite
the
same
circumstances
as
during
all
these
weeks
will
you
agree
to
a
plan
of
mine
i
must
go
upstairs
now
and
do
some
packing
and
make
a
few
arrangements
but
will
you
dress
early
i
will
do
the
same
and
if
you
could
be
down
in
the
library
by
six
we
might
have
some
music
before
dinner
why
certainly
said
garth
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
at
what
time
i
dress
and
i
am
always
ready
for
music
but
i
say
i
wish
you
were
not
packing
miss
gray
i
am
not
exactly
packing
up
replied
nurse
rosemary
i
am
packing
things
away
it
is
all
the
same
if
it
means
leaving
but
you
have
promised
not
to
go
until
she
comes
i
will
not
go
until
she
comes
and
you
will
tell
her
all
the
things
she
ought
to
know
she
shall
know
all
i
know
which
could
add
to
your
comfort
and
you
will
not
leave
me
until
i
am
really
well
getting
on
all
right
i
will
never
leave
you
while
you
need
me
said
nurse
rosemary
and
again
garth
detected
that
peculiar
quality
in
her
voice
he
rose
and
came
towards
where
he
heard
her
to
be
standing
do
you
know
you
are
no
end
of
a
brick
he
said
with
emotion
then
he
held
out
both
hands
towards
her
put
your
hands
in
mine
just
for
once
little
rosemary
i
want
to
try
to
thank
you
there
was
a
moment
of
hesitation
two
strong
capable
hands
strong
and
capable
though
just
then
they
trembled
nearly
went
home
to
his
but
were
withdrawn
just
in
time
jane
hour
was
not
yet
this
was
nurse
rosemary
moment
of
triumph
and
success
it
should
not
be
taken
from
her
this
evening
she
said
softly
after
the
music
we
will
shake
hands
now
be
careful
sir
you
are
stranded
wait
here
is
the
just
to
your
left
take
a
little
air
on
the
terrace
and
sing
again
the
lovely
song
i
heard
under
my
window
this
morning
and
now
that
you
know
what
it
is
that
is
to
happen
this
exquisite
evening
will
fill
you
with
tender
expectation
sir
for
an
hour
what
has
come
to
little
rosemary
mused
garth
as
he
felt
for
his
cane
in
its
corner
by
the
window
we
could
not
have
gone
on
indefinitely
quite
as
we
have
been
since
she
came
in
from
the
he
walked
on
a
troubled
look
clouding
his
face
suddenly
it
lifted
and
he
stood
still
and
laughed
duffer
he
said
oh
what
a
conceited
duffer
she
is
thinking
of
her
man
she
is
going
to
him
and
her
mind
is
full
of
him
just
as
mine
is
full
of
jane
dear
good
clever
little
rosemary
i
hope
he
is
worthy
of
her
no
that
he
can
not
be
i
hope
he
knows
he
is
not
worthy
of
her
that
is
more
to
the
point
i
hope
he
will
receive
her
as
she
expects
somehow
i
hate
letting
her
go
to
him
oh
hang
the
fellow
as
tommy
would
say
chapter
xxxvi
the
revelation
of
the
rosary
simpson
was
crossing
the
hall
just
before
six
he
had
left
his
master
in
the
library
he
heard
a
rustle
just
above
him
and
looking
up
saw
a
tall
figure
descending
the
wide
oak
staircase
simpson
stood
transfixed
the
soft
black
with
its
trailing
folds
and
old
lace
at
the
bosom
did
not
impress
him
so
much
as
the
quiet
look
of
certainty
and
power
on
the
calm
face
above
them
simpson
said
jane
my
aunt
the
duchess
of
meldrum
and
her
maid
and
her
footman
and
a
rather
large
quantity
of
luggage
will
be
arriving
from
aberdeen
at
about
seven
graem
knows
about
preparing
rooms
and
i
have
given
james
orders
for
meeting
the
train
with
the
brougham
and
the
the
duchess
dislikes
motors
when
her
grace
arrives
you
can
show
her
into
the
library
we
will
dine
in
the
at
a
quarter
past
eight
meanwhile
dalmain
and
myself
are
particularly
engaged
just
now
and
must
not
be
disturbed
on
any
account
until
the
duchess
arrival
you
quite
understand
yes
stammered
simpson
he
had
been
in
a
ducal
household
early
in
his
career
and
he
considered
duchesses
nieces
to
be
people
before
whom
one
should
bow
down
jane
smiled
is
quite
sufficient
simpson
she
said
and
swept
towards
the
library
garth
heard
her
enter
and
close
the
door
and
his
quick
ear
caught
the
rustle
of
a
train
hullo
miss
gray
he
said
packed
your
uniform
yes
said
jane
i
told
you
i
was
packing
she
came
slowly
across
the
room
and
stood
on
the
looking
down
at
him
he
was
in
full
just
as
at
shenstone
on
that
memorable
night
and
as
he
sat
well
back
in
his
deep
one
knee
crossed
over
the
other
she
saw
the
crimson
line
of
his
favourite
silk
socks
jane
stood
looking
down
upon
him
her
hour
had
come
at
last
but
even
now
she
must
for
his
sake
be
careful
and
patient
i
did
not
hear
the
song
she
said
no
replied
garth
at
first
i
forgot
and
when
i
remembered
i
had
been
thinking
of
other
things
and
somehow
ah
miss
gray
i
can
not
sing
my
soul
is
dumb
with
longing
i
know
said
jane
gently
and
i
am
going
to
sing
to
you
a
faint
look
of
surprise
crossed
garth
face
do
you
sing
he
asked
then
why
have
you
not
sung
before
when
i
arrived
said
jane
dr
rob
asked
me
whether
i
played
i
said
little
thereupon
he
concluded
i
sang
a
little
too
and
he
forbade
me
most
peremptorily
either
to
play
a
little
or
sing
a
little
to
you
he
said
he
did
not
want
you
driven
altogether
mad
garth
burst
out
laughing
how
like
old
robbie
he
said
and
in
spite
of
his
injunctions
are
you
going
to
take
the
risk
and
a
little
to
me
no
said
jane
i
take
no
risks
i
am
going
to
sing
you
one
song
here
is
the
purple
cord
at
your
right
hand
there
is
nothing
between
you
and
the
piano
and
you
are
facing
towards
it
if
you
want
to
stop
me
you
can
come
she
walked
to
the
instrument
and
sat
down
over
the
top
of
the
grand
piano
she
could
see
him
leaning
back
in
his
chair
a
slightly
amused
smile
playing
about
his
lips
he
was
evidently
still
enjoying
the
humour
of
dr
rob
prohibition
the
rosary
has
but
one
opening
chord
she
struck
it
her
eyes
upon
his
face
she
saw
him
sit
up
instantly
a
look
of
surprise
expectation
bewilderment
gathering
there
then
she
began
to
sing
the
deep
rich
voice
low
and
vibrant
as
the
softest
tone
of
thrilled
into
the
startled
silence
the
hours
i
spent
with
thee
dear
heart
are
as
a
string
of
pearls
to
me
i
count
them
over
one
apart
my
rosary
my
rosary
each
hour
a
pearl
jane
got
no
further
garth
had
risen
he
spoke
no
word
but
he
was
coming
blindly
over
to
the
piano
she
turned
on
the
her
arms
held
out
to
receive
him
now
he
had
found
the
woodwork
his
hand
crashed
down
upon
the
bass
now
he
had
found
her
he
was
on
his
knees
his
arms
around
her
hers
enveloped
him
yearning
tender
hungry
with
the
repressed
longing
of
all
those
hard
weeks
he
lifted
his
sightless
face
to
hers
for
one
moment
you
he
said
you
you
all
the
time
then
he
hid
his
face
in
the
soft
lace
at
her
breast
oh
my
boy
my
darling
said
jane
tenderly
holding
the
dear
head
close
yes
i
all
the
time
all
the
time
near
him
in
his
loss
and
pain
could
i
have
stopped
away
but
oh
garth
what
it
is
at
last
to
hold
you
and
touch
you
and
feel
you
here
yes
it
is
oh
my
beloved

you
not
quite
sure
who
else
could
hold
you
thus
take
care
my
darling
come
over
to
the
couch
just
here
and
sit
beside
me
garth
rose
and
raised
her
without
loosing
her
and
she
guided
herself
and
him
to
a
safer
seat
close
by
but
there
again
he
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
and
held
her
his
arms
around
her
waist
his
face
hidden
in
the
shelter
of
her
bosom
ah
darling
darling
said
jane
softly
and
her
hands
stole
up
behind
his
head
with
a
touch
of
unspeakable
protective
tenderness
it
has
been
so
sweet
to
wait
upon
my
boy
and
help
him
in
his
darkness
and
shield
him
from
unnecessary
pain
and
be
always
there
to
meet
his
every
need
but
i
could
not
come
myself
until
he
knew
and
understood
and
had
forgiven
no
not
understood
and
yet
still
loved
for
he
does
now
understand
and
he
does
forgive
oh
garth
oh
hush
my
darling
you
frighten
me
no
i
will
never
leave
you
never
never
oh
ca

my
beloved
then
i
must
tell
you
more
plainly

and

for
a
few
days
we
must
be
as

boy

i
who

near

this
evening

here

half
an
hour
then
as
soon
as
possible
we
will
get
a
special
license
and
we
will
be
married
garth
and
then
jane
paused
and
the
man
who
knelt
beside
her
held
his
breath
to
listen
and
then
continued
jane
in
a
low
tender
voice
which
gathered
in
depth
of
sacred
mystery
yet
did
not
falter
then
it
will
be
my
highest
joy
to
be
always
with
my
husband
night
and
day
a
long
sweet
silence
the
tempest
of
emotion
in
her
arms
was
hushed
to
rest
the
eternal
voice
of
perfect
love
had
whispered
peace
be
still
and
there
was
a
great
calm
at
last
garth
lifted
his
head
always
always
together
he
said
ah
that
will
be
light
when
simpson
pale
with
importance
flung
open
the
library
door
and
announced
her
grace
the
duchess
of
meldrum
jane
was
seated
at
the
piano
playing
soft
dreamy
chords
and
a
slim
young
man
in
evening
dress
advanced
with
eager
hospitality
to
greet
his
guest
the
duchess
either
did
not
see
or
chose
to
ignore
the
guiding
cord
she
took
his
outstretched
hand
warmly
in
both
her
own
goodness
gracious
my
dear
dal
how
you
surprise
me
i
expected
to
find
you
blind
and
here
you
are
striding
about
just
your
old
handsome
self
dear
duchess
said
garth
and
stooping
kissed
the
kind
old
hands
still
holding
his
i
can
not
see
you
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
i
feel
very
blind
my
darkness
has
been
lightened
by
a
joy
beyond
expression
oh
ho
so
that
the
way
the
land
lies
now
which
are
you
going
to
marry
the
nurse
who
i
gather
is
a
most
respectable
young
person
and
highly
recommended
or
that
hussy
jane
who
without
the
smallest
compunction
orders
her
poor
aunt
from
one
end
of
the
kingdom
to
the
other
to
suit
her
own
convenience
jane
came
over
from
the
piano
and
slipped
her
hand
through
her
arm
dear
aunt
she
said
you
know
you
loved
coming
because
you
enjoy
a
mystery
and
like
being
a
dear
old
ex
machina
at
the
right
moment
and
he
is
going
to
marry
them
both
because
they
both
love
him
far
too
dearly
ever
to
leave
him
again
and
he
seems
to
think
he
can
not
do
without
either
the
duchess
looked
at
the
two
radiant
faces
one
sightless
the
other
with
glad
proud
eyes
for
both
and
her
own
filled
with
tears
she
said
are
we
in
salt
lake
city
well
we
always
thought
one
girl
would
not
do
for
dal
he
would
need
the
combined
perfections
of
several
and
he
appears
to
think
he
has
found
them
god
bless
you
both
you
absurdly
happy
people
and
i
will
bless
you
too
but
not
until
i
have
dined
now
ring
for
that
very
nervous
person
with
and
tell
him
i
want
my
maid
and
my
room
and
i
want
to
know
where
they
have
put
my
toucan
i
had
to
bring
him
jane
he
is
so
loving
dear
bird
i
knew
you
would
think
him
in
the
way
but
i
really
could
not
leave
him
behind
chapter
xxxvii
in
the
face
of
this
congregation
the
society
paragraphs
would
have
described
it
as
a
very
quiet
wedding
when
garth
and
jane
a
few
days
later
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
together
in
the
little
episcopal
church
among
the
hills
perhaps
to
those
who
were
present
it
stands
out
rather
as
an
unusual
wedding
than
as
a
quiet
one
to
garth
and
jane
the
essential
thing
was
to
be
married
and
left
to
themselves
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
they
could
not
be
induced
to
pay
any
attention
to
details
as
to
the
manner
in
which
this
desired
end
was
to
be
attained
jane
left
it
entirely
to
the
doctor
in
one
practical
though
casual
sentence
just
make
sure
it
is
valid
dicky
and
send
us
in
the
bills
the
duchess
being
a
true
conservative
early
began
mentioning
veils
and
white
satin
but
jane
said
my
dear
aunt
fancy
me
in
i
should
look
like
a
christmas
pantomime
and
i
never
wear
veils
even
in
motors
and
white
satin
is
a
form
of
clothing
i
have
always
had
the
wisdom
to
avoid
then
in
what
do
you
intend
to
be
married
unnatural
girl
inquired
the
duchess
in
whatever
i
happen
to
put
on
that
morning
replied
jane
knotting
the
silk
of
a
soft
crimson
cord
she
was
knitting
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
to
where
garth
sat
smoking
on
the
terrace
have
you
a
inquired
her
grace
of
meldrum
with
dangerous
calmness
and
can
you
send
me
to
the
station
this
afternoon
we
can
always
send
to
the
station
at
a
moment
notice
said
jane
working
in
a
golden
strand
and
considering
the
effect
but
where
are
you
going
dear
aunt
you
know
deryck
and
flower
arrive
this
evening
i
am
washing
my
hands
of
you
and
going
south
said
the
duchess
wrathfully
do
do
that
dear
said
jane
placidly
you
have
washed
your
hands
of
me
so
often
and
like
the
blood
of
king
duncan
of
scotland
i
am
upon
them
still
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
sweeten
this
little
hand
then
raising
her
voice
garth
if
you
want
to
walk
just
give
a
call
i
am
here
talking
over
my
trousseau
with
aunt
what
is
a
trousseau
came
back
in
garth
happy
voice
a
thing
you
get
into
to
be
married
said
jane
then
let
get
into
it
quickly
shouted
garth
with
enthusiasm
dear
aunt
said
jane
let
us
make
a
compromise
i
have
some
quite
nice
clothes
upstairs
including
redfern
and
several
uniforms
let
your
maid
look
through
them
and
whatever
you
select
and
she
puts
out
in
readiness
on
my
wedding
morning
i
promise
to
wear
this
resulted
in
jane
appearing
at
the
church
in
a
long
blue
cloth
coat
and
skirt
handsomely
embroidered
with
gold
and
suiting
her
large
figure
to
perfection
a
deep
yellow
vest
of
brocaded
silk
and
old
lace
ruffles
at
neck
and
wrists
garth
was
as
anxious
about
his
wedding
garments
as
jane
had
been
indifferent
over
hers
but
he
had
so
often
been
in
requisition
as
at
town
weddings
that
simpson
had
no
difficulty
in
turning
him
out
in
the
acme
of
correct
bridal
attire
and
very
handsome
he
looked
as
he
stood
waiting
at
the
chancel
steps
not
watching
for
his
bride
but
obviously
listening
for
her
for
as
jane
came
up
the
church
on
deryck
arm
garth
slightly
turned
his
head
and
smiled
the
duchess
resplendent
in
purple
satin
and
ermine
with
white
plumes
in
her
bonnet
and
many
jewelled
chains
depending
from
her
which
rattled
and
tinkled
in
the
silence
of
the
church
every
time
she
moved
was
in
a
front
pew
on
the
left
ready
to
give
her
niece
away
in
a
corresponding
seat
on
the
opposite
side
as
near
as
possible
to
the
bridegroom
sat
margery
graem
in
black
silk
with
a
small
quilted
satin
bonnet
and
a
white
lawn
kerchief
folded
over
the
faithful
old
heart
which
had
beaten
in
tenderness
for
garth
since
his
babyhood
she
turned
her
head
anxiously
every
time
the
duchess
jingled
but
otherwise
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
marriage
service
in
a
in
her
lap
margery
was
not
used
to
the
episcopal
service
and
she
had
her
doots
as
to
whether
it
could
possibly
be
gone
through
correctly
by
all
parties
concerned
in
fact
this
anxiety
of
old
margery
increased
so
painfully
when
the
ceremony
actually
commenced
that
it
took
audible
form
and
she
repeated
all
the
answers
of
the
bridal
pair
in
an
impressive
whisper
after
them
dr
rob
being
the
only
available
bachelor
did
duty
as
jane
having
stipulated
that
he
should
not
be
intrusted
with
the
ring
her
previous
observations
leading
her
to
conclude
that
he
would
most
probably
slip
it
unconsciously
on
to
his
finger
and
then
search
through
all
his
own
pockets
and
all
garth
and
begin
taking
up
the
church
matting
before
it
occurred
to
him
to
look
at
his
hand
jane
would
not
have
minded
the
diversion
but
she
did
object
to
any
delay
so
the
ring
went
to
church
in
garth
waistcoat
pocket
where
it
had
lived
since
jane
brought
it
out
from
aberdeen
and
without
any
fumbling
or
hesitation
was
quietly
laid
by
him
upon
the
open
book
dr
rob
had
charge
of
the
fees
for
clerk
verger
and
every
person
connected
with
the
church
who
could
possibly
have
a
tip
pressed
upon
them
garth
was
generous
in
his
gladness
and
eager
to
do
all
things
in
a
manner
worthy
of
the
great
gift
made
fully
his
that
day
so
dr
rob
was
well
provided
with
the
wherewithal
and
this
he
jingled
in
his
pockets
as
soon
as
the
exhortation
commenced
and
his
interest
in
the
proceedings
resulted
in
his
fatal
habit
of
unconsciousness
of
his
own
actions
thus
he
and
the
duchess
kept
up
a
tinkling
duet
each
hearing
the
other
and
not
their
own
sounds
so
the
duchess
glared
at
dr
rob
and
dr
rob
frowned
at
the
duchess
and
old
margery
looked
tearfully
at
both
deryck
brand
the
tallest
man
in
the
church
his
fine
figure
showing
to
advantage
in
the
long
frock
coat
with
silk
facings
which
lady
brand
had
pronounced
indispensable
to
the
occasion
retired
to
a
seat
beside
his
wife
just
behind
old
margery
as
soon
as
he
had
conducted
jane
to
garth
side
as
jane
removed
her
hand
from
his
arm
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
and
a
long
look
passed
between
them
all
the
memories
all
the
comprehension
all
the
trust
and
affection
of
years
seemed
to
concentrate
in
that
look
and
lady
brand
eyes
dropped
to
her
dainty
white
and
gold
she
had
never
known
jealousy
the
doctor
had
never
given
her
any
possible
reason
for
acquiring
that
cruel
knowledge
his
flower
bloomed
for
him
and
her
fragrance
alone
made
his
continual
joy
all
other
lovely
women
were
mere
botanical
specimens
to
be
examined
and
classified
but
flower
had
never
quite
understood
the
depth
of
the
friendship
between
her
husband
and
jane
founded
on
the
associations
and
aspirations
of
childhood
and
early
youth
and
a
certain
similarity
of
character
which
would
not
have
wedded
well
but
which
worked
out
into
a
comradeship
providing
a
source
of
strength
for
both
of
late
flower
had
earnestly
tried
to
share
even
while
failing
to
comprehend
it
perhaps
she
in
her
pale
primrose
gown
with
daffodils
at
her
waist
and
sunbeams
in
her
golden
hair
was
the
most
truly
bridal
figure
in
the
church
as
the
doctor
turned
from
the
bride
and
sought
his
place
beside
her
in
the
pew
he
looked
at
the
sweet
face
bent
so
demurely
over
the
and
thought
he
had
never
seen
his
wife
look
more
entrancingly
lovely
unconsciously
his
hand
strayed
to
the
white
rosebud
she
had
fastened
in
his
coat
as
they
strolled
round
the
conservatory
together
that
morning
flower
glancing
up
surprised
his
look
she
did
not
think
it
right
to
smile
in
church
but
a
delicate
wave
of
colour
swept
over
her
face
and
her
cheek
leaned
as
near
the
doctor
shoulder
as
the
size
of
her
hat
would
allow
flower
felt
quite
certain
that
was
a
look
the
doctor
had
never
given
jane
the
service
commenced
the
clergyman
very
nervous
and
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
unusual
facts
of
a
special
license
a
blind
bridegroom
and
the
reported
presence
of
a
duchess
began
reading
very
fast
in
an
undertone
which
old
margery
could
not
follow
though
her
finger
imprisoned
in
unwonted
kid
hurried
along
the
lines
then
conscious
of
his
mistake
he
slowed
down
and
became
too
impressive
making
long
pauses
fled
in
by
the
tinkling
of
the
duchess
and
the
chinking
in
dr
rob
thus
they
arrived
at
the
demand
upon
the
congregation
if
they
could
show
any
just
cause
why
these
two
persons
might
not
lawfully
be
joined
together
now
to
speak
and
the
pause
here
was
so
long
and
so
that
old
margery
said
nay
and
then
gave
a
nervous
sob
the
bridegroom
turned
and
smiled
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
and
the
doctor
leaning
forward
laid
his
hand
on
the
trembling
shoulder
and
whispered
steady
old
friend
it
is
all
right
there
was
no
pause
whatever
after
the
solemn
charge
to
the
couple
so
if
garth
and
jane
had
any
secrets
to
disclose
they
had
perforce
to
keep
them
for
after
discussion
then
jane
found
her
right
hand
firmly
clasped
in
garth
and
no
inadequacy
of
the
church
could
destroy
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
church
words
in
which
garth
was
asked
if
he
would
take
her
to
be
his
own
to
this
garth
and
old
margery
said
they
would
with
considerable
display
of
emotion
then
the
question
was
put
to
jane
the
church
seeming
to
remind
her
gently
that
she
took
him
in
his
blindness
with
all
which
that
might
entail
jane
said
i
will
and
the
deep
tender
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
rosary
when
the
words
were
uttered
garth
lifted
the
hand
he
held
and
reverently
kissed
it
this
was
not
in
the
rubric
and
proved
disconcerting
to
the
clergyman
he
threw
up
his
head
suddenly
and
inquired
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
and
as
for
the
moment
there
was
no
response
he
repeated
the
question
wildly
gazing
into
distant
corners
of
the
church
then
the
duchess
who
up
to
that
time
had
been
feeling
a
little
bored
realised
that
her
moment
had
come
and
rejoiced
she
sailed
out
of
her
pew
and
advanced
to
the
chancel
step
my
dear
good
man
she
said
give
my
niece
away
having
come
north
at
considerable
inconvenience
for
that
express
purpose
now
go
on
what
do
we
do
next
dr
rob
broke
into
an
uncontrollable
chuckle
the
duchess
lifted
her
lorgnette
and
surveyed
him
margery
searched
her
in
vain
for
the
duchess
response
it
did
not
appear
to
be
there
flower
looked
in
distressed
appeal
at
the
doctor
but
the
doctor
was
studying
with
grave
intentness
a
stencilled
pattern
on
the
chancel
roof
and
paid
no
attention
to
flower
nudge
the
only
people
completely
unconscious
of
anything
unusual
in
the
order
of
proceedings
appeared
to
be
the
bride
and
bridegroom
they
were
taking
each
other
in
the
sight
of
god
and
in
the
face
of
this
congregation
they
were
altogether
absorbed
in
each
other
standing
together
in
the
sight
of
god
and
the
deportment
of
this
congregation
was
a
matter
they
scarcely
noticed
people
always
behave
grotesquely
at
weddings
jane
had
said
to
garth
beforehand
and
ours
will
be
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
but
we
can
close
our
eyes
and
stand
together
in
sightless
land
and
deryck
will
take
care
it
is
valid
not
in
sightless
land
my
beloved
said
garth
but
in
the
land
where
they
need
no
candle
neither
light
of
the
sun
however
and
wherever
i
take
you
as
my
wife
i
shall
be
standing
on
the
summit
of
god
heaven
so
they
stood
and
in
their
calmness
the
church
hushed
to
silence
the
service
proceeded
and
the
minister
who
had
not
known
how
to
keep
them
from
clasping
hands
when
the
rubric
did
not
require
it
found
no
difficulty
in
inducing
them
to
do
so
again
so
they
took
each
other
these
two
who
were
so
deeply
each
already
solemnly
reverently
tenderly
in
the
sight
of
god
they
took
each
other
according
to
god
holy
ordinance
and
the
wedding
ring
type
of
that
eternal
love
which
has
neither
beginning
nor
ending
passed
from
garth
pocket
over
the
holy
book
on
to
jane
finger
when
it
was
over
she
took
his
arm
and
leaning
upon
it
so
that
he
could
feel
she
leaned
guided
him
to
the
vestry
afterwards
in
the
brougham
for
those
few
precious
minutes
when
husband
and
wife
find
themselves
alone
for
the
first
time
garth
turned
to
jane
with
an
eager
naturalness
which
thrilled
her
heart
as
no
studied
speech
could
have
done
he
did
not
say
my
wife
that
unique
moment
had
been
theirs
three
years
before
dearest
he
said
how
soon
will
they
all
go
how
soon
shall
we
be
quite
alone
oh
why
could
they
drive
to
the
station
from
the
church
jane
looked
at
her
watch
because
we
must
lunch
them
dear
she
said
think
how
good
they
have
all
been
and
we
could
not
start
our
married
life
by
being
inhospitable
it
is
just
one
and
we
ordered
luncheon
at
their
train
leaves
the
station
at
four
in
three
hours
garth
we
shall
be
alone
shall
i
be
able
to
behave
nicely
for
three
hours
exclaimed
garth
boyishly
you
must
said
jane
or
i
shall
fetch
nurse
rosemary
oh
hush
he
said
all
that
is
too
precious
for
chaff
jane
he
turned
suddenly
and
laid
his
hand
on
hers
jane
do
you
understand
that
you
are
now
actually
my
wife
jane
took
his
hand
and
held
it
against
her
heart
just
where
she
so
often
had
pressed
her
own
when
she
feared
he
would
hear
it
throbbing
my
darling
she
said
i
do
not
understand
it
but
i
know
ah
thank
god
i
know
it
to
be
true
chapter
xxxviii
perpetual
light
moonlight
on
the
terrace
silvery
white
serene
garth
and
jane
had
stepped
out
into
the
brightness
and
finding
the
night
so
warm
and
still
and
the
nightingales
filling
the
woods
and
hills
with
music
they
moved
their
usual
fireside
chairs
close
to
the
parapet
and
sat
there
in
restful
comfort
listening
to
the
sweet
sounds
of
the
quiet
night
the
solitude
was
so
perfect
the
restfulness
so
complete
garth
had
removed
the
cushion
seat
from
his
chair
and
placed
it
on
the
gravel
and
sat
at
his
wife
feet
leaning
against
her
knees
she
stroked
his
hair
and
brow
softly
as
they
talked
and
every
now
and
then
he
put
up
his
hand
drew
hers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
the
ring
he
had
never
seen
long
tender
silences
fell
between
them
now
that
they
were
at
last
alone
thoughts
too
deep
joys
too
sacred
for
words
trembled
about
them
and
silence
seemed
to
express
more
than
speech
only
garth
could
not
bear
jane
to
be
for
a
moment
out
of
reach
of
his
hand
what
to
another
would
have
been
i
can
not
let
her
out
of
my
sight
was
to
him
i
can
not
let
her
be
beyond
my
touch
and
jane
fully
understood
this
and
let
him
feel
her
every
moment
within
reach
and
the
bliss
of
this
was
hers
as
well
as
his
for
sometimes
it
had
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
hunger
in
her
heart
caused
by
those
long
weeks
of
waiting
when
her
arms
ached
for
him
and
yet
she
dared
not
even
touch
his
hand
would
never
be
appeased
sweet
sweet
sweet
thrill
sang
a
nightingale
in
the
wood
and
garth
whistled
an
exact
imitation
oh
darling
said
jane
that
reminds
me
there
is
something
i
do
so
want
you
to
sing
to
me
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
i
think
you
will
remember
it
was
on
that
monday
evening
after
i
had
seen
the
pictures
and
nurse
rosemary
had
described
them
to
you
both
our
poor
hearts
were
on
the
rack
and
i
went
up
early
in
order
to
begin
my
letter
of
confession
but
you
told
simpson
not
to
come
for
you
until
eleven
while
i
was
writing
in
the
room
above
i
could
hear
you
playing
in
the
library
you
played
many
things
i
knew
music
we
had
done
together
long
ago
and
then
a
theme
i
had
never
heard
crept
in
and
caught
my
ear
at
once
because
it
was
quite
new
to
me
and
so
marvellously
sweet
i
put
down
my
pen
and
listened
you
played
it
several
times
with
slight
variations
as
if
trying
to
recall
it
and
then
to
my
joy
you
began
to
sing
i
crossed
the
room
softly
opened
my
window
and
leaned
out
i
could
hear
some
of
the
words
but
not
all
two
lines
however
reached
me
distinctly
with
such
penetrating
tender
sadness
that
i
laid
my
head
against
the
feeling
as
if
i
could
write
no
more
and
wait
no
longer
but
must
go
straight
to
you
at
once
garth
drew
down
the
dear
hand
which
had
held
the
pen
that
night
turned
it
over
and
softly
kissed
the
palm
what
were
they
jane
he
said
us
o
christ
when
all
is
gone
safe
home
at
last
and
oh
my
darling
the
pathos
of
those
words
all
is
gone
whoever
wrote
that
music
had
been
through
suffering
such
as
ours
then
came
a
theme
of
such
inspiring
hopefulness
and
joy
that
i
arose
armed
with
fresh
courage
took
up
my
pen
and
went
on
with
my
letter
again
two
lines
had
reached
me
thou
eternal
light
of
light
art
lord
of
all
what
is
it
garth
and
whose
and
where
did
you
hear
it
and
will
you
sing
it
to
me
now
darling
i
have
a
sudden
wish
that
you
should
sing
it
here
and
now
and
i
ca
wait
garth
sat
up
and
laughed
a
short
happy
laugh
in
which
all
sorts
of
emotions
were
mingled
jane
i
like
to
hear
you
say
you
ca
wait
it
is
like
you
because
you
are
so
strong
and
patient
and
yet
it
is
so
deliciously
like
you
if
you
feel
it
to
say
it
i
found
the
words
in
the
at
worcester
cathedral
this
time
last
year
at
i
copied
them
into
my
during
the
reading
of
the
first
lesson
i
am
ashamed
to
say
but
it
was
all
about
what
balak
said
unto
balaam
and
balaam
said
unto
balak
so
i
hope
i
may
be
forgiven
they
seemed
to
me
some
of
the
most
beautiful
words
i
had
ever
read
and
fortunately
i
committed
them
to
memory
of
course
i
will
sing
them
to
you
if
you
wish
here
and
now
but
i
am
afraid
the
air
will
sound
rather
poor
without
the
accompaniment
however
not
for
worlds
would
i
move
from
here
at
this
moment
so
sitting
up
in
the
moonlight
with
his
back
to
jane
his
face
uplifted
and
his
hands
clasped
around
one
knee
garth
sang
much
practice
had
added
greatly
to
the
sweetness
and
flexibility
of
his
voice
and
he
rendered
perfectly
the
exquisite
melody
to
which
the
words
were
set
jane
listened
with
an
overflowing
heart
the
radiant
morn
hath
passed
away
and
spent
too
soon
her
golden
store
the
shadows
of
departing
day
creep
on
once
more
our
life
is
but
a
fading
dawn
its
glorious
noon
how
quickly
past
lead
us
o
christ
when
all
is
gone
safe
home
at
last
where
saints
are
clothed
in
spotless
white
and
evening
shadows
never
fall
where
thou
eternal
light
of
light
art
lord
of
all
the
triumphant
worship
of
the
last
line
rang
out
into
the
night
and
died
away
garth
loosed
his
hands
and
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
of
vast
content
against
his
wife
knees
beautiful
she
said
beautiful
garthie
perhaps
it
is
because
you
sang
it
and
but
it
seems
to
me
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
heard
ah
and
how
appropriate
for
us
on
this
day
of
all
days
oh
i
do
know
said
garth
stretching
his
legs
in
front
of
him
and
crossing
his
feet
the
one
over
the
other
i
certainly
feel
home
at
last
not
because
is
gone
but
because
i
have
all
in
having
you
jane
jane
bent
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
his
head
my
own
boy
she
said
you
have
all
i
have
to
give
all
all
but
darling
in
those
dark
days
which
are
past
all
seemed
gone
for
us
both
us
o
christ
it
was
he
who
led
us
safely
through
the
darkness
and
has
brought
us
to
this
and
garth
i
love
to
know
that
he
is
lord
of
all
lord
of
our
joy
lord
of
our
love
lord
of
our
lives
our
wedded
lives
my
husband
we
could
not
be
so
safely
so
blissfully
each
other
were
we
not
one
in
him
is
this
true
for
you
also
garth
garth
felt
for
her
left
hand
drew
it
down
and
laid
his
cheek
against
it
then
gently
twisted
the
wedding
ring
that
he
might
kiss
it
all
round
yes
my
wife
he
said
i
thank
god
that
i
can
say
in
all
things
eternal
light
of
light
art
lord
of
all
a
long
sweet
silence
then
jane
said
suddenly
oh
but
the
music
garthie
that
exquisite
setting
whose
is
it
and
where
did
you
hear
it
garth
laughed
again
a
laugh
of
pleasure
i
am
glad
you
like
it
jane
he
said
because
i
must
plead
guilty
to
the
fact
that
it
is
my
own
you
see
i
knew
no
music
for
it
the
gave
the
words
only
and
on
that
awful
night
when
little
rosemary
had
mercilessly
rubbed
it
in
about
lady
portrayed
and
what
her
love
must
have
been
and
would
have
been
and
could
have
been
and
had
made
me
see
wife
again
and
the
other
picture
i
felt
so
bruised
and
sore
and
lonely
and
then
those
words
came
to
my
mind
us
o
christ
when
all
is
gone
safe
home
at
last
all
seemed
gone
indeed
and
there
seemed
no
home
to
hope
for
in
this
world
he
raised
himself
a
little
and
then
leaned
back
again
so
that
his
head
rested
against
her
bosom
safe
home
at
last
he
said
and
stayed
quite
still
for
a
moment
in
utter
content
then
remembered
what
he
was
telling
her
and
went
on
eagerly
so
those
words
came
back
to
me
and
to
get
away
from
despairing
thoughts
i
began
reciting
them
to
an
accompaniment
of
chords
radiant
morn
hath
passed
away
and
spent
too
soon
her
golden
store
the
shadows
of
departing
day
and
then
suddenly
jane
i
saw
it
pictured
in
sound
just
as
i
used
to
see
a
sunset
in
light
and
shadow
and
then
transfer
it
to
my
canvas
in
shade
and
colour
i
heard
a
sunset
in
harmony
and
i
felt
the
same
kind
of
tingle
in
my
fingers
as
i
used
to
feel
when
inspiration
came
and
i
could
catch
up
my
brushes
and
palette
so
i
played
the
sunset
and
then
i
got
the
theme
for
life
fading
and
what
one
feels
when
the
glorious
noon
is
suddenly
plunged
into
darkness
and
then
the
prayer
and
then
i
heard
a
vision
of
heaven
where
evening
shadows
never
fall
and
after
that
came
the
end
just
certainty
and
worship
and
peace
you
see
the
eventual
theme
worked
out
of
all
this
it
was
like
making
studies
for
a
picture
that
was
why
you
heard
it
over
and
over
i
was
trying
to
remember
i
was
gathering
it
into
final
form
i
am
awfully
glad
you
like
it
jane
because
if
i
show
you
how
the
harmonies
go
perhaps
you
could
write
it
down
and
it
would
mean
such
a
lot
to
me
if
you
thought
it
worth
singing
i
could
play
the
accompaniment
hullo
is
it
beginning
to
rain
i
felt
a
drop
on
my
cheek
and
another
on
my
hand
no
answer
then
he
felt
the
heave
with
which
jane
caught
her
breath
and
realised
that
she
was
weeping
in
a
moment
he
was
on
his
knees
in
front
of
her
jane
why
what
is
the
matter
sweet
what
on
earth
have
i
said
anything
to
trouble
you
jane
what
is
it
o
god
why
ca
i
see
her
jane
mastered
her
emotion
controlling
her
voice
with
an
immense
effort
then
drew
him
down
beside
her
hush
darling
hush
it
is
only
a
great
joy
a
wonderful
surprise
lean
against
me
again
and
i
will
try
to
tell
you
do
you
know
that
you
have
composed
some
of
the
most
beautiful
music
in
the
world
do
you
know
my
own
boy
that
not
only
your
proud
and
happy
wife
but
all
women
who
can
sing
will
want
to
sing
your
music
garthie
do
you
realise
what
it
means
the
creative
faculty
is
so
strong
in
you
that
when
one
outlet
was
denied
it
it
burst
forth
through
another
when
you
had
your
sight
you
created
by
the
hand
and
eye
now
you
will
create
by
the
hand
and
ear
the
power
is
the
same
it
merely
works
through
another
channel
but
oh
think
what
it
means
think
the
world
lies
before
you
once
more
garth
laughed
and
put
up
his
hand
to
the
dear
face
still
wet
with
thankful
tears
oh
bother
the
world
he
said
i
do
want
the
world
i
only
want
my
wife
jane
put
her
arms
around
him
ah
what
a
boy
he
was
in
some
ways
how
full
of
irrepressible
essential
youth
just
then
she
felt
so
much
older
than
he
but
how
little
that
mattered
the
better
could
she
wrap
him
round
with
the
greatness
of
her
tenderness
shield
him
from
every
jar
or
disillusion
and
help
him
to
make
the
most
of
his
great
gifts
i
know
darling
she
said
and
you
have
her
she
is
just
all
yours
but
think
of
the
wonderful
future
thank
god
i
know
enough
of
the
technical
part
to
write
the
scores
of
your
compositions
and
garth
fancy
going
together
to
noble
cathedrals
and
hearing
your
anthems
sung
and
to
concerts
where
the
most
perfect
voices
in
the
world
will
be
doing
their
utmost
adequately
to
render
your
songs
fancy
thrilling
hearts
with
pure
harmony
stirring
souls
with
just
as
before
you
used
to
awaken
in
us
all
by
your
wonderful
paintings
an
appreciation
and
comprehension
of
beauty
garth
raised
his
head
is
it
really
as
good
as
that
jane
he
said
dear
answered
jane
earnestly
i
can
only
tell
you
that
when
you
sang
it
first
and
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
it
was
yours
i
said
to
myself
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
heard
i
am
glad
said
garth
simply
and
now
let
talk
of
something
else
oh
i
say
jane
the
present
is
too
wonderful
to
leave
any
possible
room
for
thoughts
about
the
future
do
talk
about
the
present
jane
smiled
and
it
was
the
smile
of
the
wife
mysterious
compassionate
tender
she
leaned
over
him
and
rested
her
cheek
upon
his
head
yes
darling
we
will
talk
of
this
very
moment
if
you
wish
you
begin
look
at
the
house
and
describe
it
to
me
as
you
see
it
in
the
moonlight
very
grey
and
calm
and
and
so
garthie
are
there
lights
in
the
windows
yes
the
library
lights
are
just
as
we
left
them
the
french
window
is
standing
wide
open
the
pedestal
lamp
under
a
crimson
silk
shade
looks
very
pretty
from
here
shedding
a
warm
glow
over
the
interior
then
i
can
see
one
candle
in
the
i
think
simpson
is
putting
away
silver
any
others
jane
yes
darling
there
is
a
light
in
the
oriel
chamber
i
can
see
margery
moving
to
and
fro
she
seems
to
be
arranging
my
things
and
giving
final
touches
there
is
also
a
light
in
your
room
next
door
ah
now
she
has
gone
through
i
see
her
standing
and
looking
round
to
make
sure
all
is
right
dear
faithful
old
heart
garth
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
at
home
served
and
tended
by
those
who
really
love
us
i
am
so
glad
you
feel
that
said
garth
i
half
feared
you
might
regret
not
having
an
ordinary
honeymoon
and
yet
no
i
was
really
afraid
of
that
or
of
anything
just
together
at
last
was
all
we
wanted
was
it
my
wife
all
a
clock
in
the
house
struck
nine
dear
old
clock
said
garth
softly
i
used
to
hear
it
strike
nine
when
i
was
a
little
chap
in
my
crib
trying
to
keep
awake
until
my
mother
rustled
past
and
went
into
her
room
the
door
between
her
room
and
mine
used
to
stand
ajar
and
i
could
see
her
candle
appear
in
a
long
streak
upon
my
ceiling
when
i
saw
that
streak
i
fell
asleep
immediately
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
know
she
was
there
and
would
not
go
down
again
jane
do
you
like
the
oriel
chamber
yes
dear
it
is
a
lovely
room
and
very
sacred
because
it
was
hers
do
you
know
aunt
georgina
insisted
upon
seeing
it
garth
and
said
it
ought
to
be
whitened
and
papered
but
i
would
not
hear
of
that
because
the
beautiful
old
ceiling
is
and
so
are
the
walls
and
i
was
certain
you
had
loved
those
paintings
as
a
little
boy
and
would
remember
them
now
ah
yes
said
garth
eagerly
a
french
artist
stayed
here
and
did
them
water
and
rushes
and
the
most
lovely
flamingoes
those
on
the
walls
standing
with
their
feet
in
the
water
and
those
on
the
ceiling
flying
with
wings
outspread
into
a
pale
green
sky
all
over
white
billowy
clouds
jane
i
believe
i
could
walk
round
that
room
blindfold
no
i
mean
as
i
am
now
and
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
each
flamingo
stands
you
shall
said
jane
tenderly
these
slips
when
he
talked
momentarily
forgetting
his
blindness
always
wrung
her
heart
by
degrees
you
must
tell
me
all
the
things
you
specially
did
and
loved
as
a
little
boy
i
like
to
know
them
had
you
always
that
room
next
door
to
your
mother
ever
since
i
can
remember
said
garth
and
the
door
between
was
always
open
after
my
mother
death
i
kept
it
locked
but
the
night
before
my
birthday
i
used
to
open
it
and
when
i
woke
early
and
saw
it
ajar
i
would
spring
up
and
go
quickly
in
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
dear
presence
was
there
to
greet
me
just
on
that
one
morning
but
i
had
to
go
quickly
and
immediately
i
wakened
just
as
you
must
go
out
early
to
catch
the
rosy
glow
of
sunrise
on
the
fleeting
clouds
or
to
see
the
gossamer
webs
on
the
gorse
outlined
in
diamonds
by
the
sparkling
summer
dew
but
somehow
margery
found
out
about
it
and
the
third
year
there
was
a
sheet
of
firmly
stuck
to
the
pincushion
by
a
large
pin
saying
in
margery
careful
caligraphy
happy
returns
of
the
day
master
garthie
it
was
very
touching
because
it
was
meant
to
be
so
comforting
and
tactful
but
it
destroyed
the
illusion
since
then
the
door
has
been
kept
closed
another
long
sweet
silence
two
nightingales
in
distant
trees
sang
alternately
answering
one
another
in
liquid
streams
of
melody
again
garth
turned
the
wedding
ring
then
spoke
with
his
lips
against
it
you
said
margery
had
through
is
it
open
he
asked
jane
clasped
both
hands
behind
his
head
strong
capable
hands
though
now
they
trembled
a
little
and
pressed
his
face
against
her
as
she
had
done
on
the
terrace
at
shenstone
three
years
before
yes
my
own
boy
she
said
it
is
jane
oh
jane
he
released
himself
from
the
pressure
of
those
restraining
hands
and
lifted
his
adoring
face
to
hers
then
suddenly
jane
broke
down
ah
darling
she
said
take
me
away
from
this
horrible
white
moonlight
i
can
not
bear
it
it
reminds
me
of
shenstone
it
reminds
me
of
the
wrong
i
did
you
it
seems
a
separating
thing
between
you
and
me
this
cruel
brightness
which
you
can
not
share
her
tears
fell
on
his
upturned
fate
then
garth
sprang
to
his
feet
the
sense
of
manhood
and
mastery
the
right
of
control
the
joy
of
possession
arose
within
him
even
in
his
blindness
he
was
the
stronger
even
in
his
helplessness
for
the
great
essentials
jane
must
lean
on
him
he
raised
her
gently
put
his
arms
about
her
and
stood
there
glorified
by
his
great
love
hush
sweetest
wife
he
said
neither
light
nor
darkness
can
separate
between
you
and
me
this
quiet
moonlight
can
not
take
you
from
me
but
in
the
still
sweet
darkness
you
will
feel
more
completely
my
own
because
it
will
hold
nothing
we
can
not
share
come
with
me
to
the
library
and
we
will
send
away
the
lamps
and
close
the
curtains
and
you
shall
sit
on
the
couch
near
the
piano
where
you
sat
on
that
wonderful
evening
when
i
found
you
and
when
i
almost
frightened
my
brave
jane
but
she
will
not
be
frightened
now
because
she
is
so
my
own
and
i
may
say
what
i
like
and
do
what
i
will
and
she
must
not
threaten
me
with
nurse
rosemary
because
it
is
jane
i
want
jane
jane
just
only
jane
come
in
beloved
and
i
who
see
as
clearly
in
the
dark
as
in
the
light
will
sit
and
play
the
rosary
for
you
and
then
veni
creator
spiritus
and
i
will
sing
you
the
verse
which
has
been
the
secret
source
of
peace
and
the
sustaining
power
of
my
whole
inner
life
through
the
long
hard
years
apart
now
whispered
jane
now
as
we
go
so
garth
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
as
they
walked
sang
softly
enable
with
perpetual
light
the
dulness
of
our
blinded
sight
anoint
and
cheer
our
soiled
face
with
the
abundance
of
thy
grace
keep
far
our
foes
give
peace
at
home
where
thou
art
guide
no
ill
can
come
thus
leaning
on
her
husband
yet
guiding
him
as
she
leaned
jane
passed
to
the
perfect
happiness
of
her
wedded
home
