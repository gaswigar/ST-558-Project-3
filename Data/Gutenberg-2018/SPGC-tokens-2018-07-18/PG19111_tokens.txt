the
late
afternoon
sun
hid
behind
gray
banks
of
snow
clouds
and
a
cold
wind
whipped
loose
leaves
across
the
drill
field
in
front
of
the
philadelphia
barracks
of
the
north
american
continental
thruway
patrol
there
was
the
feel
of
snow
in
the
air
but
the
thermometer
hovered
just
at
the
freezing
mark
and
the
clouds
could
turn
either
into
icy
rain
or
snow
patrol
sergeant
ben
martin
stepped
out
of
the
door
of
the
barracks
and
shivered
as
a
blast
of
wind
hit
him
he
pulled
up
the
zipper
on
his
loose
blue
uniform
coveralls
and
paused
to
gauge
the
storm
clouds
building
up
to
the
west
the
broad
planes
of
his
sunburned
face
turned
into
the
driving
cold
wind
for
a
moment
and
then
he
looked
back
down
at
the
weather
report
secured
to
the
top
of
a
stack
of
papers
on
his
clipboard
behind
him
the
door
of
the
barracks
was
shouldered
open
by
his
junior
partner
patrol
trooper
clay
ferguson
the
young
tall
canadian
officer
arms
were
loaded
with
paper
sacks
and
his
patrol
work
helmet
dangled
by
its
strap
from
the
crook
of
his
arm
clay
turned
and
moved
from
the
doorway
into
the
wind
a
sudden
gust
swept
around
the
corner
of
the
building
and
a
small
sack
perched
atop
one
of
the
larger
bags
in
his
arms
blew
to
the
ground
and
began
tumbling
towards
the
drill
field
ben
he
yelled
grab
the
bag
the
sergeant
lunged
as
the
sack
bounced
by
and
made
the
retrieve
he
walked
back
to
ferguson
and
eyed
the
load
of
bags
in
the
officer
arms
just
what
is
all
this
he
inquired
groceries
the
youngster
grinned
or
to
be
more
exact
little
gourmet
items
for
our
moments
of
gracious
living
ferguson
turned
into
the
walk
leading
to
the
motor
pool
and
martin
swung
into
step
beside
him
want
me
to
carry
some
of
that
junk
junk
clay
cried
indignantly
you
keep
your
grimy
paws
off
these
delicacies
peasant
you
get
yours
in
due
time
and
perhaps
it
will
help
kelly
and
me
to
make
a
more
polished
product
of
you
instead
of
the
clodlike
cop
you
are
today
martin
chuckled
this
patrol
would
mark
the
start
of
the
second
year
that
he
clay
ferguson
and
officer
kelly
lightfoot
had
been
teamed
together
after
patrols
cooped
up
in
a
semiarmored
vehicle
with
a
man
for
ten
days
at
a
time
you
got
to
know
him
pretty
well
and
you
either
liked
him
or
you
hated
his
guts
as
senior
officer
martin
had
the
right
to
reject
or
keep
his
partner
after
their
first
duty
tour
martin
had
elected
to
retain
the
lanky
canadian
as
soon
as
they
had
pulled
into
new
york
barracks
at
the
end
of
their
last
patrol
he
had
made
his
decisions
after
eleven
months
and
patrols
on
the
continental
thruways
each
team
had
a
furlough
coming
martin
and
ferguson
had
headed
for
the
city
the
minute
they
put
their
signatures
on
the
last
of
the
stack
of
reports
needed
at
the
end
of
a
tour
then
for
five
days
and
nights
they
tied
one
on
mso
kelly
lightfoot
had
made
a
beeline
for
a
columbia
medical
school
seminar
on
tissue
regeneration
on
the
sixth
day
clay
staggered
out
of
bed
swigged
down
a
handful
of
antireaction
pills
showered
shaved
and
dressed
and
then
waved
twenty
minutes
later
he
was
aboard
a
jet
heading
for
his
parents
home
in
edmonton
alberta
martin
soloed
around
the
city
for
another
week
then
rented
a
car
and
raced
up
to
his
sister
home
in
burlington
vermont
to
play
uncle
bountiful
to
carol
three
kids
and
to
lap
up
as
much
as
possible
of
his
real
cooking
while
the
troopers
and
their
med
officer
relaxed
a
service
crew
moved
their
car
down
to
the
philadelphia
motor
pool
for
a
full
overhaul
and
refitting
for
the
next
torturous
of
duty
the
two
patrol
troopers
had
reported
into
the
philadelphia
barracks
five
days
ago
martin
several
pounds
heavier
courtesy
of
his
cooking
ferguson
several
pounds
lighter
courtesy
of
three
assorted
alberta
maidens
they
turned
into
the
gate
of
the
motor
pool
and
nodded
to
the
sentry
at
the
gate
to
their
left
the
vast
shop
buildings
echoed
to
the
sound
of
equipment
and
roaring
jet
engines
the
darkening
sky
made
the
brilliant
lights
of
the
shop
seem
even
brighter
and
the
hulls
of
a
dozen
patrol
cars
cast
deep
shadows
around
the
work
crews
the
troopers
turned
into
the
dispatcher
office
and
clay
carefully
placed
the
bags
on
a
table
beside
the
counter
martin
peered
into
one
of
the
bags
seriously
kid
what
do
you
have
in
that
grab
bag
oh
just
a
few
essentials
clay
replied
de
foie
sharp
cheese
a
smidgen
of
cooking
wine
a
handful
of
spices
you
know
stuff
like
that
like
i
said
essentials
essentials
martin
snorted
you
give
your
brains
to
one
of
those
alberta
chicks
of
yours
for
a
souvenir
look
ben
ferguson
said
earnestly
i
suffered
for
eleven
months
in
that
tin
mausoleum
on
tracks
because
of
what
you
fondly
like
to
think
is
edible
food
you
got
as
much
culinary
imagination
as
beulah
i
take
that
back
even
beulah
turns
out
some
better
smells
when
riding
on
high
jet
than
you
ever
get
out
of
her
galley
in
the
next
one
hundred
years
this
tour
i
intend
to
eat
like
a
human
being
once
again
and
i
teach
you
how
to
boil
water
without
burning
it
why
you
ungrateful
young
martin
yelped
the
patrol
dispatcher
who
had
been
listening
with
amused
tolerance
leaned
across
the
counter
if
oscar
waldorf
is
through
with
his
culinary
lecture
gentlemen
he
said
perhaps
you
two
could
be
persuaded
to
take
a
little
pleasure
ride
it
a
lovely
night
for
a
drive
and
it
just
hundred
miles
to
the
next
service
station
if
you
two
are
cooking
anything
at
the
moment
i
know
that
norcon
would
simply
adore
having
the
services
of
two
such
distinguished
continental
commandos
ferguson
flushed
and
martin
scowled
at
the
dispatcher
very
funny
clown
i
recommend
you
for
trooper
status
one
of
these
days
not
me
the
dispatcher
protested
i
a
married
man
you
never
get
me
out
on
the
road
in
one
of
those
factories
so
quit
sounding
off
to
us
heroes
martin
said
and
give
us
the
clearances
the
dispatcher
opened
a
reference
book
on
the
counter
and
then
punched
the
first
of
a
series
of
buttons
on
a
panel
behind
him
the
wall
lighted
with
a
map
of
the
eastern
united
states
to
the
mississippi
river
ferguson
and
martin
had
pencils
out
and
poised
over
their
clipboards
the
dispatcher
glanced
at
the
order
board
across
the
room
where
patrol
car
numbers
and
team
names
were
displayed
on
an
illuminated
board
car
glowed
with
an
amber
light
in
the
column
to
the
right
was
the
number
the
dispatcher
punched
another
button
a
broad
belt
of
lines
representing
the
eastern
segment
of
north
american
thruway
flashed
onto
the
map
in
a
band
extending
from
philadelphia
to
louis
the
thruway
went
on
to
los
angeles
in
its
western
segment
not
shown
on
the
map
ten
bands
of
color
each
five
separated
by
a
narrow
clear
strip
detailed
the
thruway
martin
and
ferguson
were
concerned
with
the
northern
five
bands
nat
other
unlighted
lines
radiated
out
in
tangential
spokes
to
the
north
and
south
along
the
length
of
the
belt
of
nat
this
was
just
one
small
segment
of
the
continental
thruway
system
that
spanned
north
america
from
coast
to
coast
and
crisscrossed
north
and
south
under
the
three
nation
road
compact
from
the
southern
tip
of
mexico
into
canada
and
alaska
each
arterial
cut
a
path
across
the
continent
and
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
only
structures
along
the
roadways
were
the
turretlike
norcon
patrol
check
and
relay
stations
looming
up
at
intervals
like
the
fire
control
islands
of
aircraft
carriers
car
with
trooper
sergeant
ben
martin
trooper
clay
ferguson
and
officer
kelly
lightfoot
would
take
their
first
patrol
on
nat
barring
major
disaster
they
would
eat
sleep
and
work
the
entire
time
from
their
car
out
of
sight
of
any
but
distant
cities
until
they
had
reached
los
angeles
at
the
end
of
the
patrol
then
a
resupply
and
briefing
period
and
back
onto
another
thruway
during
the
coming
patrol
they
would
cross
ten
state
lines
as
if
they
did
exist
and
as
far
as
thruway
traffic
control
and
authority
was
concerned
state
and
national
boundaries
actually
did
exist
with
the
growth
of
the
old
interstate
highway
system
and
the
alcan
highway
it
became
increasingly
evident
that
variation
in
motor
vehicle
laws
from
state
to
state
and
country
to
country
were
creating
impossible
situations
for
any
uniform
safety
control
with
the
establishment
of
the
continental
thruway
system
two
decades
later
came
the
birth
of
the
the
north
american
thruway
patrol
known
as
norcon
within
the
bands
of
the
thruways
all
land
by
each
of
the
three
nations
the
continental
commandos
of
norcon
were
the
sole
law
enforcement
agency
and
authority
violators
of
thruway
law
were
cited
into
norcon
district
traffic
courts
located
in
the
nearest
city
to
each
access
port
along
every
thruway
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
authority
of
norcon
public
demand
for
faster
and
more
powerful
vehicles
had
forced
the
automotive
industry
to
put
more
and
more
power
under
the
touch
of
the
millions
of
drivers
crowding
the
continent
roads
piston
drive
gave
way
to
turbojet
turbojet
was
boosted
by
a
modification
of
ram
jet
and
drive
was
added
in
the
last
two
years
the
first
of
the
nuclear
reaction
mass
engines
had
hit
the
roads
even
as
the
hot
ferraris
and
jags
of
the
would
have
been
suicide
vehicles
on
the
roads
of
the
so
would
today
vehicles
be
on
the
interstates
of
the
but
building
roads
capable
of
handling
three
hundred
to
four
hundred
miles
an
hour
speeds
was
beyond
the
financial
and
engineering
capabilities
of
individual
states
and
nations
thus
grew
the
continental
thruways
with
their
four
speed
lanes
in
each
direction
each
a
wide
separated
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
by
a
landscaped
divider
under
the
three
nation
compact
the
thruways
now
wove
a
net
across
the
entire
north
american
continent
on
the
big
wall
map
nat
showed
as
four
colored
lines
blue
and
yellow
as
the
two
high
and
speed
lanes
green
and
white
for
the
intermediate
and
slow
lanes
between
the
blue
and
yellow
and
the
white
and
green
was
a
red
band
this
was
the
police
emergency
lane
never
used
by
other
than
official
vehicles
and
crossed
by
the
traveling
public
shifting
from
one
speed
lane
to
another
only
at
sweeping
crossovers
the
dispatcher
picked
up
an
electric
pointer
and
aimed
the
light
beam
at
the
map
referring
to
his
notes
he
began
to
recite
resurfacing
crews
working
on
blue
at
milestone
marker
to
marker
estimated
clearance
hours
tuesday
let
see
tomorrow
morning
the
two
officers
were
writing
the
information
down
on
their
sheets
ohio
state
is
playing
cal
under
the
lights
at
columbus
tonight
so
you
can
expect
a
traffic
surge
sometime
shortly
after
hours
but
most
of
it
will
stay
in
the
green
and
white
watch
out
for
the
drunks
though
they
might
filter
out
onto
the
blue
or
yellow
the
crossover
for
nat
has
painting
crews
working
might
watch
out
for
any
crud
on
the
roadway
and
they
got
the
entrance
blocked
there
so
that
all
exchange
traffic
is
being
rerouted
to
west
of
chillicothe
the
dispatcher
thumbed
through
his
reference
sheets
that
seems
to
be
about
all
no
wait
a
minute
this
is
on
your
trick
the
army
got
a
priority
missile
convoy
moving
out
of
the
aberdeen
proving
grounds
bound
for
the
west
coast
tonight
at
hours
it
will
be
moving
at
green
lane
speeds
so
you
might
watch
out
for
it
they
have
units
in
the
convoy
and
that
is
all
oh
yes
already
aboard
i
guess
you
know
about
the
weather
martin
nodded
yup
we
should
be
hitting
light
snows
by
hours
tonight
in
this
area
and
it
could
be
anything
from
snow
to
after
that
he
grinned
at
his
younger
partner
the
vacation
is
over
sonny
tonight
we
make
a
man
out
of
you
ferguson
grinned
back
nuts
to
you
pop
i
got
character
witnesses
back
in
edmonton
who
give
you
glowing
testimonials
about
my
manhood
testimonials
are
legal
unless
they
given
by
adults
martin
retorted
come
on
lover
boy
duty
calls
clay
carefully
embraced
his
armload
of
bundles
and
the
two
officers
turned
to
leave
the
dispatcher
leaned
across
the
counter
oh
ferguson
one
thing
i
forgot
there
some
light
corrugations
in
red
lane
just
east
of
louis
you
might
be
careful
with
your
souffles
in
that
area
would
want
them
to
fall
you
know
clay
paused
and
started
to
turn
back
the
grinning
dispatcher
ducked
into
the
back
office
and
slammed
the
door
the
wind
had
died
down
by
the
time
the
troopers
entered
the
brilliantly
lighted
parking
area
the
temperature
seemed
warmer
with
the
lessening
winds
but
in
actuality
the
mercury
was
dropping
the
snow
clouds
to
the
west
were
much
nearer
and
the
overcast
was
getting
darker
but
under
the
great
overhead
light
tubes
the
parking
area
was
brighter
than
day
a
dozen
huge
patrol
vehicles
were
parked
on
the
front
hot
line
scores
more
were
lined
out
in
ranks
to
the
back
of
the
parking
zone
martin
and
ferguson
walked
down
the
line
of
military
blue
cars
number
was
fifth
on
the
line
service
mechs
were
just
fueling
lines
into
a
ground
panel
as
the
troopers
walked
up
the
technician
corporal
was
the
first
to
speak
all
set
sarge
he
said
we
had
to
change
an
induction
jet
at
the
last
minute
and
i
had
the
port
engine
running
up
to
reline
the
flow
thought
i
better
top
off
for
you
though
before
you
pull
out
she
sounds
like
a
purring
kitten
he
tossed
the
pair
a
waving
salute
and
then
moved
out
to
his
service
dolly
where
three
other
mechs
were
waiting
the
officers
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
bulk
of
the
huge
patrol
car
beulah
looks
like
she
been
to
the
beauty
shop
and
had
the
works
martin
said
he
reached
out
and
slapped
the
maglurium
plates
welcome
home
sweetheart
i
see
you
kept
a
candle
in
the
window
for
your
wandering
son
ferguson
looked
up
at
the
lighted
cab
sixteen
feet
above
the
pavement
car
beulah
to
her
team
was
a
standard
norcon
patrol
vehicle
she
was
sixty
feet
long
twelve
feet
wide
and
twelve
feet
high
topped
by
a
bubble
canopy
over
her
cab
all
the
way
across
her
nose
was
a
luminescent
strip
this
was
the
variable
beam
headlight
that
could
cut
a
swath
of
light
through
night
fog
rain
or
snow
and
could
be
varied
in
intensity
width
and
elevation
immediately
above
the
headlight
strip
were
two
plastic
panels
which
when
lighted
sent
out
a
flashing
red
emergency
signal
that
could
be
seen
for
miles
similar
emergency
lights
and
white
light
strips
adorned
beulah
stern
her
bow
rounded
down
like
an
tank
and
blended
into
the
track
assembly
of
her
dual
propulsion
system
with
the
exception
of
the
cabin
bubble
and
a
stepdown
on
the
last
fifteen
feet
of
her
hull
beulah
was
free
of
external
protrusions
racked
into
a
recess
on
one
side
of
the
hull
was
a
crane
arm
with
a
lift
capacity
several
round
hatches
covered
other
extensible
gear
and
periscopes
used
in
the
scores
of
multiple
operations
the
norcon
cars
were
called
upon
to
accomplish
on
routine
road
patrols
beulah
resembled
a
gigantic
offspring
of
a

martin

that
garbage
of
yours
in
the

and
start
on
the

i
help
you
after
i
finish
out
here
as
the
younger
officer
entered
the
car
and
headed
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
to
the
working
deck
the
sergeant
unclipped
a
check
list
from
the
inside
of
the
door
and
turned
towards
the
stern
of
the
big
vehicle
clay
mounted
to
the
work
deck
and
turned
back
to
the
little
galley
just
aft
of
the
cab
as
compact
as
a
spaceship
kitchen
as
a
matter
of
fact
designed
almost
identically
from
models
on
the
moon
run
the
galley
had
but
three
feet
of
open
counter
space
everything
else
sink
range
oven
and

were
with

as

he
set
his
bags
on
the
small
counter
to
put
away
after
the
check
aft
of
the
galley
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
passageway
were
the
bunks
for
the
patrol
troopers
across
the
passageway
was
a
tiny
latrine
and
shower
clay
tossed
his
helmet
on
the
lower
bunk
as
he
went
down
the
passageway
at
the
bulkhead
to
the
rear
he
pressed
a
wall
panel
and
a
thick
insulated
door
slid
back
to
admit
him
to
the
engine
compartment
the
service
crews
had
shut
down
the
big
power
plants
and
turned
off
the
air
exchangers
and
already
the
heat
from
the
massive
engines
made
the
compartment
uncomfortably
warm
he
hurried
through
into
a
small
machine
shop
in
an
emergency
the
troopers
could
turn
out
small
parts
for
disabled
vehicles
or
for
other
uses
it
also
stocked
a
good
supply
of
the
most
common
failure
parts
racked
against
the
ceiling
were
banks
of
cutting
torches
a
grim
reminder
that
death
or
injury
still
rode
the
thruways
with
increasing
frequency
in
the
tank
storage
space
between
the
ceiling
and
top
of
the

were
the
chemical

that

compartments
between

deck
and

were

fuel
storage
tanks
the
last
after
compartment
was
a
complete

one
that
would
have
made
the
emergency

or
even
the
light
surgery
rooms
of
hospitals
proud
clay
tapped
on

officer
kelly
lightfoot
was
sitting
on
the
deck
stowing
sterile
bandage
packs
into
a
lower
locker
she
looked
up
at
clay
and
smiled
well
well
you
did
manage
to
tear
yourself
away
from
your
adoring
bevies
she
said
she
flicked
back
a
wisp
of
hair
from
her
forehead
and
stood
up
the
uniform
coverall
with
its
belted
waist
did
do
much
to
hide
a
lovely
properly
curved
figure
she
walked
over
to
the
tall
canadian
trooper
and
reached
up
and
grabbed
his
ear
she
pulled
his
head
down
examined
one
side
critically
and
then
quickly
snatched
at
his
other
ear
and
repeated
the
scrutiny
she
let
go
of
his
ear
and
stepped
back
damned
if
you
did
get
all
the
lipstick
marks
off

it
out
kelly
he
said
sometimes
you
act
just
like
my
mother
the
redhead
grinned
at
him
and
turned
back
to
her
stack
of
boxes
on
the
deck
she
bent
over
and
lifted
one
of
the
boxes
to
the
operating
table
clay
eyed
her
trim
figure
you
might
act
like
ma
sometimes
he
said
but
you
sure
do
look
like
her
it
was
the
indian

turn
to
flush
she
became
very
busy
with
the
contents
of
the

where
ben
she
asked
over
her

you
about

kelly
turned
and
slowly
scanned
the
confines
of
the
dispensary
with
the
exception
of
the
boxes
on
the
table
and
floor
everything
was
behind
secured
locker

the

three
collapsible
autolitters
hung
from

six
hospital
bunks
in
two
tiers
of
three
each
lined
another

on

kelly
utilized
one
of
the
hospital
bunks
for
her
own
use
except
when
they
might
all
be
occupied
with
accident
or
other
kind
of
patients
and
this
would
never
be
for
more
than
a
short
period
just
long
enough
to
transfer
them
to
a
regular
ambulance
or
hospital
vehicle
her
meager
supply
of
personal
items
needed
for
the

were
stowed
in

she
shared
the

with
the

down
at

and
headed

of

from

on

at

a
steel
grill
with
a

the

two
bunks
were
racked
up
against
the
walls
on

the

hull

flicked
lightly
at
the

knobs
from
deep
within
the

came
the
muted

whine
of
the

engines
followed
a
later
by
the
roar
of
the

caught

his

a

reverberated
through

kelly
hurled

into

her

a

a

out

looked
over
at

ferguson
if
it

the
gruesome
twosome
he
called
where
have
you

been
we
thought
the
front
office
had
finally
caught
up
with
you
and
found
out
that
neither
one
of
you
could
read
or
write
and
that
they
had
canned
you
we
ca
read
ben
quipped
back
that
why
we
still
on
the
job
the
front
office
would
never
hire
anyone
who
would
embarrass
you
two
by
being
smarter
than
either
of
you
where
you
headed
eddie
got
the
other

said
hey

the
other

oh

cloverleaf
clay
retorted
the
other
car
broke
the
connection
and
with
a
wave
veered
off
to
the
right
the
thruway
entrances
were
just
ahead
martin
aimed
beulah
at
the
lighted
orifice
topped
by
the
number
the
patrol
car
slid
into
the
narrower
tunnel
glided
along
for
another
mile
and
then
turned
its
bow
upwards
three
minutes
later
they
emerged
from
the
tunnel
into
the
red
patrol
lane
of
continental
thruway
the
late
afternoon
sky
was
a
covering
of
gray
wool
and
a
drop
or
two
of
moisture
struck
the
front
face
of
the

canopy
for
a

on
either

streams

the

the

then
peered
at

he
made
a
mental
bet
with
himself
that
the
weather
bureau
was
off
on
its
snow
estimates
by
six
hours
his
vermont
upbringing
told
him
it
would
be
flurrying
within
the
hour
he
increased
speed
to
a
steady
one
hundred
and
the
car
sped
silently
and
easily
along
the
police
lane
across
the

clay
peered
pensively
at
the
steady
stream
of
cars

cargo

racing
by

green

all
of
them
moving
faster

the
young
officer
turned
in

and
looked
at
his
partner

gravely

opened

she
slipped

and
then
sat
down
on

by

rear
door
to
wait
until
the

stopped
car
was
now
less
than
two
miles
from
the

and
traffic
in

was
at
a
standstill
a
half
mile
farther
westward
lights
were
still
moving
slowly
along
the
white

ahead
the
troopers
could
see
a
faint
wisp
of
smoke
rising
from
the
heaviest
congregation
of
headlights
both
officers
had
their
work
helmets
on
and
clay
had
left
his
seat
and
descended
to
the
side
door
ready
to
jump
out
the
minute
the
car
stopped
martin
saw
a
clear
area
in
the
green
lane
and
swung
the
car
over
the
dividing
curbing
the
big
tracks
floated
the
patrol
car
over
the
high
rounded
abutment
that
divided
each

snow
was
falling
faster
as
the
headlight
picked
out
a
tangled
mass
of
wreckage
smoldering
a
hundred
feet
inside
the
median
separating
the
green
and
white
lanes
a
crumpled
body
lay
on
the
pavement
twenty
feet
from
the
biggest
clump
of
smashed
metal
and
other
fragments
of
vehicles
were
strung
out
down
the
roadway
for
fifty
feet
there
was
no
movement
norcon
thruway
laws
were
strict
and
none
were
more
rigidly
enforced
than
the
regulation
that
no
one
other
than
a
member
of
the
patrol
set
foot
outside
of
their
vehicle
while
on
any
thruway
traffic
lane
this
meant
not
giving
any
assistance
whatsoever
to
accident
victims
the
ruling
had
been
called
inhuman
monstrous
unthinkable
and
lawmakers
in
the
three
nations
of
the
compact
had
forced
norcon
to
revoke
the
rule
in
the
early
days
of
the
thruways
after
speeding
cars
and
cargo
carriers
had
cut
down
twice
as
many
on
foot
at
accident
scenes
than
the
accidents
themselves
caused
the
law
was
reinstated
the
lives
of
the
many
were
more
vital
than
the
lives
of
a
few
martin
halted
the
patrol
vehicle
a
few
feet
from
the
wreckage
and
beulah
was
still
rocking
gently
on
her
tracks
by
the
time
both
patrol
trooper
clay
ferguson
and
mso
kelly
lightfoot
hit
the
pavement
on
the

in

martin
called

car

release

and
resume

paused
and
looked
back
at
the
halted
traffic
piled
up
before
the
lane
had
been
closed
seven
minutes
he
jumped
for
the
steps
and
sprinted
out
of
the
patrol
car
in
the
wake
of
ferguson
and
kelly
the
team
surgeon
was
kneeling
beside
the
inert
body
on
the
road
after
an
ear
to
the
chest
kelly
opened
her
field
kit
bag
and
slapped
an
electrode
to
the
victim
temple
the
needle
on
the
encephalic
meter
in
the
lid
of
the
kit
never
flickered
kelly
shut
the
bag
and
hurried
with
it
over
to
the
mass
of
wreckage
a
thin
column
of
black
oily
smoke
rose
from
somewhere
near
the
bottom
of
the
heap
it
was
almost
impossible
to
identify
at
a
glance
whether
the
mangled
metal
was
the
remains
of
one
or
more
cars
only
the
absence
of
track
equipment
made
it
certain
that
they
even
had
been
passenger
vehicles
clay
was
carefully
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
piled
up
wrecks
to
a
window
that
gaped
near
the
top
work
fast
kid
martin
called
up
something
burning
down
there
and
this
whole
thing
may
go
up

he
turned
to
face
the
halted
mass
of
cars
and
cargo
carriers
east
of
the
wreck
he
flipped
a
switch
that
cut
his

transmitter
into
the

went
over
the

once

relayed
through
beulah
transmitter
to
the
standard
receivers
on
all
cars
he
was
still
talking
as
the
traffic
began
to
move
by
the
time
he
turned
back
to
help
his
teammates
cars
were
moving
in
a
steady
stream
past
the
huge
bulk
of
the
patrol
car
both
clay
and
kelly
were
lying
flat
across
the
smashed
upturned
side
of
the
uppermost

in
the

kelly
had
her
field
bag
open
on
the

she
was
reaching

ben
martin
ran
back
to
the
patrol
car
and
flipped
up
a
panel
on
the
hull
he
pulled
back
on
one
of
the
several
levers
recessed
into
the
hull
and
the
big
wrecking
crane
swung
smoothly
out
of
its
cradle
and
over
the
wreckage
the
end
of
the

was
directly
over

from

a

of
flanges
shot
out
like
tusks
on
an
elephant
put
in
neutral
clay
directed
martin
pressed
another
lever
and
the
crane
now
could
be
moved
in
any
direction
by
fingertip
pulls
at
its
extremity
ferguson
carefully
guided
the
crane
with
its
projecting
tusks
into
the
smashed
orifice
of
the
car
window
ben
spread
it
the
crane
locked
into
position
and
the
entire
arm
split
open
in
a
v
from
its
base
martin
pressed
steadily
on
the
two
levers
controlling
each
side
of
the
divided
arm
and
the
tusks
dug
into
the
sides
of
the
smashed
window
there
was
a
steady
screeching
of
tearing
and
ripping
metal
as
the
crane
tore
window
and
frame
apart
hold
it
ferguson
yelled
and
then
eased
himself
into
the
widened
hole
ben
kelly
called
from
her
perch
atop
the
wreckage
litter
martin
raced
to
the
rear
of
the
patrol
car
where
the
sloping
ramp
stood
open
to
the
lighted
dispensary
he
snatched
at
one
of
the
autolitters
and
triggered
its
tiny
drive
motor
a
homing
beacon
in
his
helmet
guided
the
litter
as
it
rolled
down
the
ramp
turned
by
itself
and
rolled
across
the
pavement
a
foot
behind
him
it
stopped
when
he
stopped
and

touched
another
switch
cutting
the
homing
beacon

martin
raised
the
crane
and
its
ripper
bars
retracted
the
split
arms
spewed
a
pair
of
cables
terminating
in
magnalocks
the
cables
dangled
over
the
ends
of
the
autolitter
caught
the
lift
plates
on
the
litter
and
a
second
later
the
cart
was
swinging
beside
the
smashed
window
as
clay
and
kelly
eased
the
torn
body
of
a
woman
out
of
the
wreckage
and
onto
the
litter
as
ben
brought
the
litter
back
to

thickened
he
disconnected
the
cables
and
homed
the

back
to

with
its
unconscious
victim
rolled
smoothly
back
to

up
the

and
into
the
dispensary
to
the
surgical
table
martin
climbed
up
the
wreckage
beside
kelly
inside
the
twisted
interior
of
the
car
the
thick
smoke
all
but
obscured
the
bent
back
of
the
younger
trooper
and
his
powerful
handlight
barely
penetrated
the
gloom
blood
was
smeared
over
almost
every
surface
and
the
stink
of
leaking
jet
fuel
was
virtually
overpowering
from
the
depths
of
the
nightmarish
scene
came
a
tortured
scream
kelly
reached
into
a
coverall
pocket
and
produced
another
sedation
hypo
she
squirmed
around
and
started
to
slip
down
into
the
wreckage

the
lanky
canadian
eased
out
of
the
window
and
the
two
troopers
moved
back
to
the

in

then
stand
by
on
the
crane
a
mile
away
they
saw
the
flashing
emergency
lights
of

raced
diagonally
across

whipping
with
ponderous
ease
through

martin
called

affirmative
came
the
reply
even
before
the
other
patrol
vehicle
came
to
a
halt
its
crane
was
swinging
out
from

slammed
down
on
the
panel
a
curtain
of
thick
chemical
foam
burst
from
the
poised

atop
beulah
hull
and
a
later
another
stream
of
foam
erupted
from
the
other
patrol
car
the
dense
retardant
blanket
snuffed
the
fire
out
in
three
seconds
the

the
caution

fast
both
crane
operators
slammed
their

with
an
screech
the
twisted
frames
of
the
two
vehicles
ripped
apart
into
tumbled
heaps
of
broken
metal
and

martin
and
ferguson
jumped
down
the
hatch
steps
and
into

waded
and
slipped
around
the

pawing
at

and
bent
over
here
he
straightened
up
as
the

gathered
around
the
scorched
and
ripped

in

somewhere
in

as
she
worked
and
a
vagrant
strand
of
copper
hair
curled
over
her
forehead
as
martin
passed
by
he
caught
a
faint
whisper
of
perfume
and
he
smiled
appreciatively
in
the
tiny
crew
quarters
he
shut
the
door
to

out
the

into

said
it
pretty

about
half
the

cars
and
cargo

flashed
by

they
ate
clay

on
a
sliver
of
steak
and
looked
at
kelly
i
marry
you
pocahontas
if

beef

to
be
bloody

what
it

one
of

keeps
coming
to
the

that

the
irish

at

the

slowed
and
the

picked
up
the

a

ahead
the

opened
and
ben
slipped
on
his
work

and
dropped
down

brought
beulah
to
a
halt
a
dozen
yards
directly
to
the
rear
of
the
stalled
car
the
great
bulk
of
the

serving
as
a
shield
against
any
possible
speeders
that
might
not
be
observing
the
road
as
martin
reached
for
the

the
wanted
bulletin
flashed
through
his
head
what
make
of

is
that
clay
old
jalopy
tritan
with
some
rigs
probably
kids
the
junior
officer
replied
it
looks
ben
nodded
and
swung
down
out
of
the
patrol
car
he
walked
quickly
to
the
other
car
flashing
his
handlight
on
the
side
of
the
vehicle
as
he
went
up
to
the
driver
the
interior
lights
were
on
and
inside
two
obviously
frightened
young
couples
smiled
with
relief
at
the
sight
of
the
uniform
coveralls
a
teenager
in
a
dinner
jacket
was
in
the
driver
seat
and
had
the
blister
window
open

grinned
up
at
martin
boy
am
i
glad
to
see
you
officer
he
said
what
the
problem
ben
asked
i
guess
she
blew
an
impeller
the
youth
answered
we
were
heading
for
a
school
dance
at
cincinnati
and
she
was
boiling
along
like
she
was
in
orbit
when
blooey
she
just
quit
ben
surveyed
the
old
jet
sedan
what
year
is
this
clunker
he
asked
the
kid
told
him
you
kids
have
been
told
not
to
use
this
lane
for
any
vehicle
that
old
he
waved
his
hand
in
protest
as
the
youngster
started
to
tell
him
how
many
modifications
he
had
made
on
the
car
it
does
make
one
bit
of
difference
whether
you
put
a
moon
booster
on
this
wreck
it
not
supposed
to
be
in
the
blue
or
yellow
and
this
thing
probably
should
have
been
allowed
out
of
the
white
or
even
on
the
thruway
the
youngster
flushed
and
bit
his
lip
in
embarrassment
at
the
giggles
from
the
two
girls
in
the
car
well
let
get
you
out
of
here

dropped
to

out
a

warning
signal
into

the

around

a

locked

the

walked
back
to
the

warning
light
and
rolled
it
on
its
four

to
the

of

its

into

the

you
going

these

clay
asked
you
damn
right
i

martin

fill
in
the

report
i
rather
have
this
kid
hurting
in
the
pocketbook
than
dead
if
we
turn
him
loose
he
think
he
got
away
with
it
this
time
and
try
it
again
the
next
time
he
might
not
be
so
lucky
i
suppose
you
right
clay
said
but
it
does
seem
a
little
rough
ben
swung
around
in
his
seat
and
surveyed
his
junior
officer
sometimes
i
think
you
spent
four
years
in
the
patrol
academy
with
your
head
up
your
jet
pipes
he
said
he
fished
out
another
cigarette
and
took
a
deep
drag
you
had
four
solid
years
of
law
three
years
of
electronics
and
jet
and
engine
mechanics
and
engineering
psychology
math
english
spanish
and
a
smattering
of
portuguese
to
say
nothing
of
dozens
of
other
subjects
you
graduated
in
the
upper
tenth
of
your
class
with
a
in
both
transportation
and
criminology
which
is
why
you
riding
patrol
and
not
punching
a
computer
or
tinkering
with
an
engine
you
think
with
all
that
education
that
somewhere
along
the
line
you
have
learned
to
think
with
your
head
instead
of
your
emotions
clay
kept
a
studied
watch
on
the
roadway
the
minute
ben
had
turned
and
swung
his
legs
over
the
side
of
the
seat
and
pulled
out
a
cigarette
clay

that
it

it

memory
went
back
to
last

fifth
patrol
he
and
ben
with
kelly
riding
hospital
had
been
assigned
to
nat
running
out
of
villahermosa
on
the
guatemalan
border
of
mexico
to
edmonton
barracks
in
canada
it
was
the
second
night
of
the
patrol
some
seven
hundred
fifty
miles
north
of
mexico
city
near
the
town
of
san
francisco
de
borja
a
gang
of
teenage
mexican
youngsters
had
gone
roaring
up
the
yellow
at
speeds
touching
on
four
hundred
miles
an
hour
their
car
a
veteran
of
less
speedy
and
much
rockier
local
mountain
roads
had
been
gimmicked
by
the
kids
so
that
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
its
original
manufacture
from
a
junkyard
they
had
obtained
a
battered
air
lift
smashed
almost
beyond
use
in
the
crackup
of
a
dollar
sports
cruiser
the
kids
pried
pounded
and
bent
the
twisted
impeller
lift
blades
back
into
some
semblance
of
alignment
from
another
wreck
of
a
cargo
carrier
came
a
pair
of
thrust
engines
they
had
the
entire
mess
so
that
it
stuck
together
on
the
old
heap
then
they
hit
the
thruway
nine
of
them
packed
into
the
jalopy
the
oldest
one
just
seventeen
years
old
they
were
doing
three
hundred
fifty
when
they
flashed
past
the
patrol
car
and
ben
had
roared
off
in
pursuit
the
senior
officer
whipped
the
big
patrol
car
across
the
crowded
high
speed
blue
lane
jockeyed
into
the
yellow
and
then
turned
on
the
power
illustration
by
this
time
the
kids
realized
they
had
been
spotted
and
they
cranked
their
makeshift
power
plant
up
to
the
last
notch
the
most
they
could
get
out
of
it
was
four
hundred
and
it
was
doing
just
that
as

clocking
better
than
five
hundred
pulled
in
behind
them
the
patrol
car
was
still
three
hundred
yards
astern
when
one
of
the
bent
and
impeller
blades
let
go
the
fan
turning
at
close
to
rpm
flew
to
pieces
and
the
air
cushion
vanished
at
four
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
body
of
the
old
jalopy
fell
the
twelve
inches
to
the
pavement
and
both
front
wheels
caved
under
there
was
a
momentary
shower
of
sparks
then
the
entire
vehicle
snapped
cartwheeling
more
than
eighty
feet
into
the
air
and
exploded
pieces
of
car
and
bodies
were
scattered
for
a
mile
down
the
thruway
and
the
only
whole
identifiable
human
bodies
were
those
of
the
three
youngsters
thrown
out
and

hurtling
to
their
deaths

clay
mind
snapped
back
to
the

he
said
quietly
to

the
senior

gave
a
satisfied
nod
and
turned
back
to
his

he
disconnected

the
two

climbed
out
into
the
cold
night
air
they

back
to
the

clay
went
to
the
rear
of
the
disabled
car
and
unhooked
the
warning
light
while
martin
went
to
the
driver
window
he
had
his
citation
book
in
hand
the
youngster
in
the
driver
seat
went
white
at
the
sight
of
the
violation
pad
may
i
see
your
license
please
ben
asked
the
boy
fumbled
in
a
back
pocket
and
then
produced
a
thin
metallic
tab
with
his
name
age
address
and
license
number
etched
into
the
indestructible
and
unalterable
metal
also
your
car
registration
ben
added
the
youth
unclipped
similar
metal
strip
from
the
dashboard
the
trooper
took
the
two
tabs
and
walked
to
the
rear
of
the
patrol
car
he
slid
back
a
panel
to
reveal
two
thin
slots
in
the
hull
martin
slid
the
driver
license
into
one
of
the
slots
the
registration
tab
into
the
other
he
pressed
a
button
below
each
slot
inside
the
car
a
magnetic
reader
and
scanned
the
magnetic
symbols
implanted
in
the
tags
the
information
was
fed
instantly
to
continental
headquarters
records
division
at
colorado
springs
in
fractions
of
a
second
the
great
computers
at
records
were
comparing
the
information
on
the
tags
with
all
previous
traffic
citations
issued
anywhere
in
the
north
american
continent
in
the
past
years
since
the
birth
of
the
patrol
the
information
from
the
license
and
registration
tab
had
been
relayed
from
beulah
via
the
nearest
patrol
relay
point
the
answer
came
back
the
same
way
above
the
license
recording
slot
were
two
small
lights
the
first
flashed
green
license
is
in
order
and
valid
the
second
flashed
green
as
well
no
previous
citations
ben
withdrew
the
tag
from
the
slot
had
the
first
light
come
on
red
he
would
have
placed
the
driver
under
arrest
immediately
had
the
second
light
turned
amber
it
would
have
indicated
a
previous
minor
violation
this
ben
would
have
noted
on
the
new
citation
if
the
second
light
had
been
red
this
would
have
meant
either
a
major
previous
violation
or
more
than
one
minor
citation
again
the
driver
would
have
been
under
immediate
arrest
the
law
was
mandatory
one
big
strike
and
you
out
two
foul
tips
and
the
same
story
and
out
meant
just
that
fines
possibly
jail
or
prison
sentence
and
lifetime
revocation
of

privileges
ben
flipped
the

registration
slot
to

strip

emergency
lane
out

law
they
knew
and
knew
well
survival
chances
were
dim
anytime
something
went
wrong
on
the
thruways
that
little
margin
of
luck
vanished
once
outside
the
security
of
the
vehicle
body
martin
finished
writing
and
then
slipped
the
driver
license
into
a
pocket
worked
into
the
back
of
the
metallic
paper
foil
of
the
citation
blank
he
handed
the
pad
into
the
window
to
the
driver
together
with
a
carbon
stylus
the
boy
lip
trembled
and
he
signed
the
citation
with
a
shaky
hand
ben
ripped
off
the
citation
blank
and
license
fed
them
into
the
slot
on
the
patrol
car
and
pressed
both
the
car
registration
and
license
record
buttons
ten
seconds
later
the
permanent
record
of
the
citation
was
on
file
in
colorado
springs
and
a
duplicate
recording
of
the
action
was
in
the
continental
traffic
court
docket
recorder
nearest
to
the
driver
hometown
now
no
power
in
three
nations
could
fix
that
ticket
ben
withdrew
the
citation
and
registration
tag
and
walked
back
to
the
car
he
handed
the
boy
the
license
and
registration
tab
together
with
a
copy
of
the
citation
ben
bent
down
to
peer
into
the
car
i
made
it
as
light
on
you
as
i
could
he
told
the
young
driver
you
charged
with
improper
use
of
the
thruway
that
a
minor
violation
by
rights
i
should
have
cited
you
for
illegal
usage
he
looked
around
slowly
at
each
of
the
young
people
you
look
like
nice
kids
he
said
i
think
you
grow
up
to
be
nice
people
i
want
you
around
long
enough
to
be
able
to
vote
in
a
few
years
who
knows
maybe
i
be
running
for
president
then
and
i
need
your
votes
it
a
cinch
that
falling
apart
in
the
middle
of
an
hour
traffic
is
no
way
to
treat
future
voters
good
night
kids
he
smiled
and
walked
away
from
the
car
the
three
young
passengers
smiled
back
at
ben
the
young
driver
just
stared
unhappily
at
the
citation
clay
stood
talking
with
the
wrecker
crewmen
ben
nodded
to
him
and
mounted
into
the
patrol
car
the
young
canadian
crushed
out
his
cigarette
and
swung
up
behind
the
sergeant
clay
went
to
the
control
seat
when
he
saw
martin
pause
in
the
door
to
the
galley
i
going
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
the
older
officer
said
and
then
take
the
first
shift

keep
beulah
i
get
back
clay
nodded
and
pushed
the
throttles
forward
car
rolled
back
into
the
police
lane
while
behind
it
the
wrecker
hooked
onto
the
disabled
car
and
swung
north
into
the
crossover
clay
checked
both
the
chronometer
and
radiodometer
and
then
reported
in
cinncy
control
this
is
car
back
in
service
cincinnati
control
acknowledged
ten
minutes
later
ben
reappeared
in
the
cab
slid
into
the
seat
hit
the
sack
kid
he
told
ferguson
the
chronometer
read
i
wake
you
at
midnight
or
sooner
if
anything
breaks
ferguson
stood
up
and
stretched
then
went
into
the
galley
he
poured
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
and
carrying
it
with
him
went
back
to
the
crew
quarters
he
closed
the
door
to
the
galley
and
sat
down
on
the
lower
bunk
to
sip
his
coffee
when
he
had
finished
he
tossed
the
cup
into
the
basket
reached
and
dimmed
the
cubby
lights
and
kicked
off
his
boots
still
in
his
coveralls
clay
stretched
out
on
the
bunk
and
sighed
luxuriously
he
reached
up
and
pressed
a
switch
on
the
bulkhead
above
his
pillow
and
the
muted
sounds
of
music
from
a
standard
broadcast
commercial
station
drifted
into
the
bunk
area
clay
closed
his
eyes
and
let
the
sounds
of
the
music
and
the
muted
rumble
of
the
engines
lull
him
to
sleep
it
took
almost
fifteen
seconds
for
him
to
be
in
deep
slumber
ben
pushed
beulah
up
to
her
steady
cruising
speed
moved
to
the
center
of
the
police
lane
and
locked
her
tracks
into
autodrive
he
relaxed
back
in
his
seat
and
divided
his
gaze
between
the
video
monitors
and
the
actual
scene
on
either
side
of
him
in
the
night
once
again
the
sky
was
lighted
this
time
much
brighter
on
the
horizon
as
the
road
ways
swept
to
the
south
of
cincinnati
traffic
was
once
again
heavy
and
fast
with
the
blue
and
green
carrying
almost
equal
loads
while
white
was
really
crowded
and
even
the
yellow
zoom
lane
was
beginning
to
fill
the
hour
density
reports
from
cinncy
had
been
given
before
the
ohio
football
game
traffic
had
hit
the
thruways
and
densities
now
were
peaking
near
twenty
thousand
vehicles
for
the
block
of
westbound
nat
out
of
cincinnati
back
to
the
east
near
the
eastern
ohio
state
line
martin
could
hear
car
calling
for
a
wrecker
and
meat
wagon
beulah
rumbled
on
through
the
night
the
video
monitors
flicked
to
the
next
stretch
as
the
patrol
car
rolled
past
another
interchange
more
vehicles
streamed
onto
the
westbound
thruway
crossing
over
and
dropping
down
into
the
same
lanes
they
held
coming
out
of
the
road
seven
years
on
patrols
had
created
automatic
reflexes
in
the
trooper
sergeant
out
of
the
mass
of
cars
and
cargoes
streaming
along
the
rushing
tide
of
traffic
his
eye
picked
out
the
track
of
one
vehicle
slanting
across
the
white
lane
just
a
shade
faster
than
the
flow
of
traffic
the
vehicle
was
still
four
or
five
miles
ahead
it
was
enough
out
of
the
ordinary
to
cause
more
than
a
second
almost
unconscious
glance
on
the
part
of
the
veteran
officer
he
kept
his
view
shifting
from
screen
to
screen
and
out
to
the
sides
of
the
car
but
the
reflexes
took
hold
again
as
his
eye
caught
the
track
of
the
same
vehicle
as
it
hit
the
crossover
from
white
to
green
squeezed
into
the
faster
lane
and
continued
its
sloping
run
towards
the
next
faster
crossover
now
martin
followed
the
movement
of
the
car
almost
constantly
the
moving
blip
had
made
the
across
the
wide
green
lane
in
the
span
of
one
crossover
and
was
now
whipping
into
the
merger
lane
that
would
take
it
over
the
top
of
the
police
lane
and
drop
down
into
the
one
hundred
fifty
to
two
hundred
mile
an
hour
blue
if
the
object
of
his
scrutiny
straightened
out
in
the
blue
let
it
go
the
driver
had
been
bordered
on
violation
in
his
fast
crossover
in
the
face
of
heavy
traffic
if
he
kept
it
up
in
the
lane
he
was
asking
for
sudden
death
the
monitors
flicked
to
the
next
block
and
ben
waited
just
long
enough
to
see
the
speeding
car
make
a
move
to
the
left
cutting
in
front
of
a
speeding
cargo
carrier
ben
slammed
beulah
into
high
once
again
the
bull
horn
blared
as
the
cocoons
slammed
shut
this
time
locking
both
clay
and
kelly
into
their
bunks
sealing
ben
into
the
control
seat
beulah
lifted
on
her
air
cushion
and
the
twin
jets
roared
as
she
accelerated
down
the
police
lane
at
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
ben
closed
the
gap
on
the
speeder
in
less
than
a
minute
and
then
edged
over
to
the
south
side
of
the
police
lane
to
make
the
jump
into
the
blue
lane
the
red
emergency
lights
and
the
radio
siren
had
already
cleared
a
hole
for
him
in
the
traffic
pattern
and
he
eased
back
on
the
finger
throttles
as
the
patrol
car
sailed
over
the
divider
and
into
the
blue
traffic
lane
now
he
had
eyeball
contact
with
the
speeding
car
still
edging
over
towards
the
lane
on
either
side
of
the
patrol
car
traffic
gave
way
falling
back
or
moving
to
the
left
and
right
car
was
now
directly
behind
the
speeding
passenger
vehicle
ben
fingered
the
switch
that
put
his
voice
signal
onto
the
standard
vehicular
emergency
frequency
the
band
that
carried
the
automatic
to
all
vehicles
the
patrol
car
was
still
hitting
above
the
mark
and
was
five
hundred
feet
behind
the
speeder
the
headlamp
bathed
the
other
car
in
a
white
glare
punctuated
with
angry
red
flashes
from
the
emergency
lights
you
are
directed
to
halt
or
be
fired
upon
ben
voice
roared
out
over
the
emergency
frequency
almost
without
warning
the
speeding
car
began
braking
down
with
such
deceleration
that
the
gargantuan
patrol
car
with
its
greater
mass
came
close
to
smashing
over
it
and
crushing
the
small
passenger
vehicle
like
an
insect
ben
cut
all
forward
power
punched
up
full
retrojet
and
at
the
instant
he
felt
beulah
tracks
touch
the
pavement
as
the
air
cushion
blew
he
slammed
on
the
brakes
only
the
safety
cocoon
kept
martin
from
being
hurled
against
the
instrument
panel
and
in
their
bunks
kelly
lightfoot
and
clay
ferguson
felt
their
insides
dragging
down
into
their
legs
the
safety
cocoons
snapped
open
and
clay
jumped
into
his
boots
and
leaped
for
the
cab
speeder
ben
snapped
as
he
jumped
down
the
steps
to
the
side
hatch
ferguson
snatched
up
his
helmet
from
the
rack
beside
his
seat
and
leaped
down
to
join
his
partner
ben
ran
up
to
the
stopped
car
through
a
thick
haze
of
smoke
from
the
retrojets
of
the
patrol
car
and
the
braking
of
both
vehicles
ferguson
circled
to
the
other
side
of
the
car
as
they
flashed
their
handlights
into
the
car
they
saw
the
driver
of
the
car
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
the
reclined
passenger
seat
a
woman
lay
stretched
out
on
the
seat
twisting
in
pain
the
man
raised
an
agonized
face
to
the
officers
my
wife
going
to
have
her
baby
right
here
kelly
ben
yelled
into
his
helmet
transmitter
maternity
the
dispensary
ramp
was
halfway
down
before
ben
had
finished
calling
kelly
jumped
to
the
ground
and
sprinted
around
the
corner
of
the
patrol
car
medical
bag
in
hand
she
shoved
clay
out
of
the
way
and
opened
the
door
on
the
passenger
side
on
the
seat
the
woman
moaned
and
then
muffled
a
scream
the
patrol
doctor
laid
her
palm
on
the
distended
belly
how
fast
are
your
pains
coming
she
asked
clay
and
ben
had
moved
away
from
the
car
a
few
feet
litter
kelly
snapped
over
her
shoulder
clay
raced
for
the
patrol
car
while
ben
unshipped
a
portable
warning
light
and
rolled
it
down
the
lane
behind
the
patrol
car
he
flipped
it
to
amber
caution
and
pass
blinking
amber
arrows
pointed
to
the
left
and
right
of
the
halted
passenger
vehicle
and
traffic
in
the
blue
lane
began
picking
up
speed
and
parting
around
the
obstructions
by
the
time
he
returned
to
the
patrol
car
kelly
had
the
expectant
mother
in
the
dispensary
she
slammed
the
door
in
the
faces
of
the
three
men
and
then
she
went
to
work
the
woman
husband
slumped
against
the
side
of
the
patrol
vehicle
ben
dug
out
his
pack
of
cigarettes
and
handed
one
to
the
shaking
driver
he
waited
until
the
man
had
taken
a
few
drags
before
speaking
mister
i
do
know
if
you
realize
it
or
not
but
you
came
close
to
killing
your
wife
your
baby
and
yourself
ben
said
softly
to
say
nothing
of
the
possibility
of
killing
several
other
families
just
what
did
you
think
you
were
doing
the
driver
shoulders
sagged
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
took
the
cigarette
from
his
mouth
honestly
officer

said

peered
up
at
martin

she
screamed
once
and
then
tried
to
muffle
them
but
i
knew
what
was
happening
and
all
i
could
think
of
was
to
get
her
to
a
hospital
i

i
went
out
of
my
head
what
with
her
moaning
and
the
traffic
and
everything

the
young
man
tossed
away
the
cigarette
and
looked
up
at
the
closed
dispensary
door

all

ben
sighed
resignedly
and
put
his
hand
on
the

best
doctors

it
in

flicked
the
headlamp
at
ferguson
in
the
control
seat
of
the
passenger
car
and
the
two
vehicles
moved
out
ben
kept
the
emergency
lights
on
while
they
eased
carefully
to
the
north
and
the
safety
of
the
police
lane
clay
picked
up
speed
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
blue
lane
and
rolled
along
until
he
reached
the
first
patrol
only
entrance
through
the
divider
to
the
service
strip
ben
followed
him
in
and
then
turned
off
the
red
blinkers
and
brought
the
patrol
car
to
a
halt
behind
the
other
vehicle
the
worried
husband
stood
up
and

fifteen
minutes

haverstraw
calmed
down
with
a
sedative
administered
by

nearly
wrung
their
hands
off
in
gratitude
as
he
said
i
mail

all
cigars
when

home
he
shouted
as
he
waved
and
climbed
into
his
car
beulah
trio
watched
the
new
father
ease
carefully
into
the
traffic
as
the
ambulance
headed
down
the
haverstraw
would
have
to
cut
over
to
the
next
exchange
and
then
go
north
to
indianapolis
arrive
later
than
his
family
this
time
he
was
the
very
picture
of
careful
driving
and
caution
as
he
threaded
his
way
across
the
green
i
wonder
if
he
knows
what
brand
of
cigars
i
smoke
kelly
mused
the
chrono
clicked
up
to
as
car
resumed
patrol
kelly
plumped
down
onto
the
jump
seat
beside
ben
clay
was
fiddling
in
the
galley
why
do
you
go
back
to
the
sack
ben
called
what
for
a
lousy
minutes
clay
replied
i
had
a
good
nap
before
you
turned
the
burners
up
to
high
besides
i
hungry
anyone
else
want
a
snack
ben
shook
his
head
no
thanks
kelly
said
ferguson
finished
slapping
together
a
sandwich
munching
on
it
he
headed
into
the
engine
room
to
make
the
midnight
check
car
had
now
been
on
patrol
eight
hours
only
two
hundred
hours
and
two
thousand
miles
to
go
kelly
looked
around
at
the
departing
back
of
the
younger
trooper
i
bet
this
is
the
only
car
in
norcon
that
has
to
stock
twenty
days
of
groceries
for
a
patrol
she
said
ben
chuckled
he
still
a
growing
boy
well
if
he
is
it
all
between
the
ears
the
girl
replied
think
that
after
a
year
i
would
have
realized
that
nothing
could
penetrate
that
thick
canuck
skull
he
gets
me
so
mad
sometimes
that
i
want
to
forget
i
a
lady
she
paused
thoughtfully
come
to
think
of
it
no
one
ever
accused
me
of
being
a
lady
in
the
first
place
sounds
like
love
ben
smiled
hunched
over
on
the
jump
seat
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
cupped
in
both
hands
kelly
gave
the
senior
officer
a
quizzical
sideways
look
ben
was
watching
his
monitors
and
missed
the
glance
kelly
sighed
and
stared
out
into
the
light
streaked
night
of
the
thruway
the
heavy
surge
of
football
traffic
had
distributed
itself
into
the
general
flow
on
the
road
and
while
all
lanes
were
busy
there
were
no
indications
of
any
overcrowding
or
much
of
the
pattern
was
shifting
from
passenger
to
cargo
vehicle
as
it
neared
midnight
the
football
crowds
were
filtering
off
at
each
exchange
and
exit
and
the
california
fans
had
worked
into
the
blue
and
yellow
mostly
the
yellow
for
the
long
trip
home
the
fewer
passenger
cars
on
the
thruway
and
the
increase
in
cargo
carriers
gave
the
troopers
a
breathing
spell
the
men
in
the
control
buckets
of
the
three
hundred
and
four
cargo
vehicles
were
the
real
pro
of
the
thruways
careful
courteous
and
fast
the
norcon
patrol
cars
could
settle
down
to
watch
out
for
the
occasional
nuts
and
drunks
that
might
bring
disaster
once
again
martin
had
the
patrol
car
on
auto
drive
in
the
center
of
the
police
lane
and
he
steeled
back
in
his
seat
beside
him
kelly
stared
moodily
into
the
night
how
come
you
never
married
ben
she
asked
the
senior
trooper
gave
her
a
startled
look
why
i
guess
for
the
same
reason
still
a
maiden
he
answered
this
just
does
seem
to
be
the
right
kind
of
a
job
for
a
married
man
kelly
shook
her
head
no
it
not
the
same
thing
with
me
she
said
at
least
not
entirely
the
same
thing
if
i
got
married
i
have
to
quit
the
patrol
and
you
would
and
secondly
if
you
must
know
the
truth
i
never
been
asked
ben
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
girl
all
of
a
sudden
she
seemed
to
have
changed
in
his
eyes
he
shook
his
head
and
turned
back
to
the
road
monitors
i
just
do
think
that
a
patrol
trooper
has
any
business
getting
married
and
trying
to
keep
a
marriage
happy
and
make
a
home
for
a
family
thirty
days
out
of
every
three
hundred
sixty
with
an
occasional
weekend
home
if
you
lucky
enough
to
draw
your
hometown
for
a
terminal
point
this
might
help
the
population
rate
but
it
sure
does
do
anything
for
the
institution
of
matrimony
illustration
i
know
some
troopers
that
are
married
kelly
said
but
there
are
very
many
ben
countered
comes
the
time
they
pull
me
off
the
cars
and
stick
me
behind
a
desk
somewhere
then
i
think
about
it
you
might
be
too
old
by
then
kelly
murmured
ben
grinned
you
sound
as
though
you
worried
about
it
he
said
no
kelly
replied
softly
no
i
not
worried
about
it
just
thinking
she
averted
her
eyes
and
looked
out
into
the
night
again
i
wonder
what
norcon
would
do
with
a
team
she
murmured
almost
to
herself
ben
looked
sharply
at
her
and
frowned
why
they
probably
split
them
up
he
said
split
what
up
clay
inquired
standing
in
the
door
of
the
cab
split
up
all
troopers
named
clay
ferguson
kelly
said
disgustedly
and
use
them
for
firewood
especially
the
heads
they
say
that
hardwood
burns
long
and
leaves
a
fine
ash
and
that
what
you
been
for
years
she
sat
erect
in
the
jump
seat
and
looked
sourly
at
the
young
trooper
clay
shuddered
at
the
pun
and
squeezed
by
the
girl
to
get
to
his
seat
i
take
it
now
pop
he
said
go
get
your
geriatrics
treatment
ben
got
out
of
his
seat
with
a
snort
i
you
skinhead
he
snapped
you
may
be
eight
years
younger
than
i
am
but
you
only
have
one
third
the
virility
and
one
tenth
the
brains
and
eight
years
from
now
you
still
be
in
deficit
spending
on
both
counts
careful
venerable
lord
of
my
destiny
clay
admonished
with
a
grin
remember
how
i
spent
my
vacation
and
remember
how
you
spent
yours
before
you
go
making
unsubstantiated
statements
about
my
virility
kelly
stood
up
if
you
two
will
excuse
me
i
go
back
to
the
dispensary
and
take
a
good
jolt
of
male
hormones
and
then
we
can
come
back
and
finish
this
talk
in
good
locker
room
company
do
you
dare
ben
cried
i
would
let
you
tamper
with
one
single
tiny
one
of
your
feminine
traits
princess
i
like
you
just
the
way
you
are
kelly
looked
at
him
with
a
cherubic
smile
you
really
mean
that
ben
the
older
trooper
flushed
briefly
and
then
turned
quickly
into
the
galley
i
going
to
try
for
some
wake
me
at
two
clay
if
nothing
else
breaks
he
turned
to
kelly
who
still
was
smiling
at
him
and
watch
out
for
that
lascivious
young
goat
it
all
just
talk

she
said
scornful

annals

she
sat
back
down
on
the
jump
seat
at
hours
it
was
vincennes
check
with
the
density
reports
all
down
in
the
past
hour
the
patrol
was
settling
into
what
looked
like
a
quiet
night
routine
kelly
chatted
with
ferguson
for
another
half
hour
and
then
rose
again
i
think
i
try
to
get
some
sleep
she
said
i
put
on
a
fresh
pot
of
coffee
for

she
rattled
around
in
the
galley

some
time

later
she

into
the
cab

she
poured
him
a
cup

set

kelly
retorted
and
strolled
back
to
the
dispensary
as
she
passed
through
the
crew
cubby
she
glanced
at
ben
sleeping
on
the
bunk
recently
vacated
by
ferguson
she
paused
and
carefully
and
gently
pulled
a
blanket
up
over
his
sleeping
form
she
smiled
down
at
the
trooper
and
then
went
softly
to
her
compartment
in
the
cab
clay
sipped
at
his
coffee
and
kept
watchful
eyes
on
the
video
monitors
beulah
was
back
on
auto
drive
and
clay
had
dropped
her
speed
to
a
slow
fifty
as
the
traffic
thinned
at
hours
he
left
the
cab
long
enough
to
go
back
and
shake
ben
awake
and
was
himself
at
to
take
back
control
he
let
ben
sleep
an
extra
hour
before
routing
him
out
of
the
bunk
again
at
the
thin
gray
light
of
the
winter
morning
was
just
taking
hold
when
ben
came
back
into
the
cab
clay
had
pulled
beulah
off
to
the
service
strip
and
was
stopped
while
he
finished
transcribing
his
scribbled
notes
from
the
washington
criminal
control
broadcast
ben
ran
his
hand
sleepily
over
his
head

asked

a
yawn

shook
his
head

in

on

the
sweating

looked
at
his
lighted

and
mentally
cursed
the
lack
of

to
cover
every
exit
state
and
local
authorities

roaring
down
the

through
the

doing
a
partial
job
of

at
those

driver
reaction
times
were
always
fast
enough
ahead
the
fleeing
suspect
car
brushed
against
a
light
sedan
sending
it
careening
and
rocking
across
the
lane
the
driver
fought
for
control
as
it
swerved
and
screeched
on
its
tilting
frame
he
brought
it
to
a
halt
amid
a
haze
of
blue
smoke
from
burning
brakes
and
bent
metal
the
white

fighting
its
way
out
of

into
the

lighter
traffic
ben

beulah
in
bulldog
pursuit
the
sideswipe
ahead
had
sent
other
cars
veering
in
panic
and
a
cluster
inadvertently
bunched
up
in
the
path
of
the
roaring
patrol
car
like
a
flock
of
chickens
they
tried
to
scatter
as
they
saw
and
heard
the
massive
police
vehicle
bearing
down
on
them
but
like
chickens
they
could
decide
which
way
to
run
it
was
a
matter
of
five
or
six
seconds
before
they
parted
enough
to
let
the
patrol
car
through
ben
had
no
choice
but
to
cut
the
throttle
and
punch
once
on
the
retrojets
to
brake
the
hurtling
patrol
car
the
momentary
drops
in
speed
unlocked
the
safety
cocoons
and
in
an
instant
clay
had
leaped
from
the
shower
stall
and
sped
to
the
cab
hearing
rather
than
seeing
his
partner
martin
snapped
over
his
shoulder
unrack
the
rifles
that
the
car
clay
reached
for
the
gun
rack
at
the
rear
of
the
cab
kelly
took
one
look
at
the
young
trooper
and
jumped
for
the
doorway
to
the
galley
a
second
later
she
was
back
without
a
word
she
handed
the
nude
ferguson
a
dangling
pair
of
uniform
coveralls
clay
gasped
dropped
the
rifles
and
grabbed
the
coveralls
from
her
hand
and
clutched
them
to
his
figure
his
face
was
still
without
speaking
kelly
turned
and
ran
back
to
her
dispensary
to
be
ready
for
the
next
acceleration
clay
was
into
the
coveralls
and
in
his
seat
almost
at
the
instant
martin
whipped
the
patrol
car
through
the
hole
in
the
blue
traffic
and
shoved
her
into
high
once
more
there
was
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
occupants
of
the
fugitive
car
knew
they
were
being
pursued
they
shot
through
the
crossover
into
the
yellow
lane
and
now
were
hurtling
down
the
thruway
close
to
the
mark
martin
had
beulah
riding
just
under
three
hundred
to
make
the
crossover
still
ten

behind
the

the

the

he
slammed
all

beulah
snapped
forward
and
even
at
three
hundred

an
hour
the
sudden
acceleration
pasted
the

against
the
back
of
their
cushioned

the

shot
forward
at
more
than
five
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
image
of
the

grew
on
the

and
then
the
two

had
it
in

a
white
racing
dot
on
the
broad

of

then

diagonally
to

the

and
the
unpaved
strip
of
landscaped
earth
that
separated
the
east

westbound
segments
of

white

into

the

into
the

like
a

it

and
smashed
its

in

the
sound
of

mingled
with
the
roar
of

as
the
car
fought
its
way
back

i

there
the
minute
we
slow
down
a
half
mile
ahead
the
fugitive
car
plowed
along
the
bottom
of
the
gentle
draw
in
a
cloud
of
snow
trying
to
fight
its
way
up
the
opposite
slope
and
onto
the
eastbound
thruway
but
the
travelaire
was
never
designed
for
driving
on
anything
but
a
modern
superhighway
car
slammed
through
the
snow
and
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
draw
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
of
the
fugitives
the
first
of
the
four
roadblock

quickly
to

caught
himself
he

a
gasp

his

the
instant

kelly
flung
herself
through

she
clasped
his

and
held
his
head
against

back
of

suddenly
the
fugitive
car
spun
sideways
bogged
in
the
wet
snow
and
muddy
ground
beneath
and
stopped
clay
bore
down
on
it
and
was
about
two
hundred
yards
away
when
the
canopy
of
the
other
vehicle
popped
open
and
a
sheet
of
automatic
weapons
fire
raked
the
patrol
car
only
the
low
angle
of
the
sedan
and
the
nearness
of
the
bulky
patrol
car
saved
the
troopers
explosive
bullets
smashed
into
the
patrol
car
canopy
and
sent
shards
of
plastiglass
showering
down
on
the
trio
an
instant
later
the
bow
cannon
on
the
first
of
the
patrol
units
opened
fire
an
ugly
blossom
of
smoke
and
fire
erupted
from
the
front
of
the
travelaire
and
it
burst
into
flames
a
second
later
the
figure
of
a
man
staggered
out
of
the
burning
car
clothes
and
hair
aflame
he
took
four
plunging
steps
and
then
fell
face
down
in
the
snow
the
car
burning
and
crackled
and
a
thick
funereal
pyre
of
oily
black
smoke
billowed
into
the
gray
sky
it
was
snowing
heavily
now
and
before
the
troopers
could
dismount
and
plow
to
the
fallen
man
a
thin
layer
of
snow
covered
his
burned
body
an
hour
later
car
was
again
on

this
time
heading
for
wichita
barracks
and
needed

in

ben
martin
was
stretched
out
on
a
hospital
bunk
with
a
traction
brace
around
his
neck
and
a
patrolwoman
fussing
over
him
in
the

peered
through
the
now
blizzard
that

and
skirled
thick
snow
across

virtually
zero
despite
the
efforts

the
dragonlike
trying

keep

the
young

despite
the
heavy
jacket
over
his
coveralls
wind
whistled
through
the
shell

in

canopy
and

sifted
and
drifted
against

the

wore
his

both
for

the

cracked
open

kelly
stuck
her
head
in

asked
we
