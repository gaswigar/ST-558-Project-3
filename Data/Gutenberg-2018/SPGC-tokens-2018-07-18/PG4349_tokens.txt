introduction
this
essay
on
wisdom
and
destiny
was
to
have
been
a
thing
of
some
twenty
pages
the
work
of
a
fortnight
but
the
idea
took
root
others
flocked
to
it
and
the
volume
has
occupied
maeterlinck
continuously
for
more
than
two
years
it
has
much
essential
kinship
with
the
treasure
of
the
humble
though
it
differs
therefrom
in
treatment
for
whereas
the
earlier
work
might
perhaps
be
described
as
the
eager
speculation
of
a
poet
athirst
for
beauty
we
have
here
rather
the
endeavour
of
an
earnest
thinker
to
discover
the
abode
of
truth
and
if
the
result
of
his
thought
be
that
truth
and
happiness
are
one
this
was
by
no
means
the
object
wherewith
he
set
forth
here
he
is
no
longer
content
with
exquisite
visions
alluring
or
haunting
images
he
probes
into
the
soul
of
man
and
lays
bare
all
his
joys
and
his
sorrows
it
is
as
though
he
had
forsaken
the
canals
he
loves
so
well
the
green
calm
motionless
canals
that
faithfully
mirror
the
silent
trees
and
roofs
and
had
adventured
boldly
unhesitatingly
on
the
broad
river
of
life
he
describes
this
book
himself
in
a
kind
of
introduction
that
is
almost
an
apology
as
a
few
interrupted
thoughts
that
entwine
themselves
with
more
or
less
system
around
two
or
three
subjects
he
declares
that
there
is
nothing
it
undertakes
to
prove
that
there
are
none
whose
mission
it
is
to
convince
and
so
true
is
this
so
absolutely
honest
and
sincere
is
the
writer
that
he
does
not
shrink
from
attacking
qualifying
modifying
his
own
propositions
from
advancing
and
insisting
on
every
objection
that
flits
across
his
brain
and
if
such
proposition
survive
the
onslaught
of
its
adversaries
it
is
only
because
in
the
deepest
of
him
he
holds
it
for
absolute
truth
for
this
book
is
indeed
a
confession
a
naive
outspoken
unflinching
description
of
all
that
passes
in
his
mind
and
even
those
who
like
not
his
theories
still
must
admit
that
this
mind
is
strangely
beautiful
there
have
been
many
columns
filled
and
doubtless
will
be
again
with
ingenious
and
scholarly
attempts
to
place
a
definitive
label
on
maeterlinck
and
his
talent
to
trace
his
thoughts
to
their
origin
clearly
denoting
the
authors
by
whom
he
has
been
influenced
in
a
measure
to
predict
his
future
and
accurately
to
establish
the
place
that
he
fills
in
the
hierarchy
of
genius
with
all
this
i
feel
that
i
have
no
concern
such
speculations
doubtless
have
their
use
and
serve
their
purpose
i
shall
be
content
if
i
can
impress
upon
those
who
may
read
these
lines
that
in
this
book
the
man
is
himself
of
untrammelled
thought
a
man
possessed
of
the
rare
faculty
of
seeing
beauty
in
all
things
and
above
all
in
truth
of
the
still
rarer
faculty
of
loving
all
things
and
above
all
life
nor
is
this
merely
a
vague
and
at
bottom
a
more
or
less
meaningless
statement
for
indeed
considering
this
essay
only
that
deals
with
wisdom
and
destiny
at
the
root
of
it
its
fundamental
principle
its
guiding
inspiring
thought
is
love
nothing
is
contemptible
in
this
world
save
only
scorn
he
says
and
for
the
humble
the
foolish
nay
even
the
wicked
he
has
the
same
love
almost
the
same
admiration
as
for
the
sage
the
saint
or
the
hero
everything
that
exists
fills
him
with
wonder
because
of
its
existence
and
of
the
mysterious
force
that
is
in
it
and
to
him
love
and
wisdom
are
one
joining
hands
in
a
circle
of
light
for
the
wisdom
that
holds
aloof
from
mankind
that
deems
itself
a
thing
apart
select
superior
he
has
scant
sympathy
it
has
wandered
too
far
from
the
watchfires
of
the
tribe
but
the
wisdom
that
is
human
that
feeds
constantly
on
the
desires
the
feelings
the
hopes
and
the
fears
of
man
must
needs
have
love
ever
by
its
side
and
these
two
marching
together
must
inevitably
find
themselves
sooner
or
later
on
the
ways
that
lead
to
goodness
there
comes
a
moment
in
life
he
says
when
moral
beauty
seems
more
urgent
more
penetrating
than
intellectual
beauty
when
all
that
the
mind
has
treasured
must
be
bathed
in
the
greatness
of
soul
lest
it
perish
in
the
sandy
desert
forlorn
as
the
river
that
seeks
in
vain
for
the
sea
but
for
unnecessary
renouncement
abandonment
of
earthly
joys
and
all
such
parasitic
virtues
he
has
no
commendation
or
approval
feeling
that
man
was
created
to
be
happy
and
that
he
is
not
wise
who
voluntarily
discards
a
happiness
for
fear
lest
it
be
taken
from
him
on
the
morrow
let
us
wait
till
the
hour
of
sacrifice
sounds
till
then
each
man
to
his
work
the
hour
will
sound
at
last
let
us
not
waste
our
time
in
seeking
it
on
the
dial
of
life
in
this
book
morality
conduct
life
are
surveyed
from
every
point
of
the
compass
but
from
an
eminence
always
austerity
holds
no
place
in
his
philosophy
he
finds
room
even
for
the
hours
that
babble
aloud
in
their
wantonness
but
all
those
who
follow
him
are
led
by
smiling
wisdom
to
the
heights
where
happiness
sits
enthroned
between
goodness
and
love
where
virtue
rewards
itself
in
the
silence
that
is
the
walled
garden
of
its
happiness
it
is
strange
to
turn
from
this
essay
to
serres
chaudes
and
la
princesse
maleine
maeterlinck
earliest
efforts
the
one
a
collection
of
vague
images
woven
into
poetical
form
charming
dreamy
and
almost
meaningless
the
other
a
youthful
and
very
remarkable
effort
at
imitation
in
the
plays
that
followed
the
princesse
maleine
there
was
the
same
curious
wandering
sense
of
and
search
for
a
vague
and
mystic
beauty
that
fair
beauty
which
no
eye
can
see
of
that
sweet
music
which
no
ear
can
measure
in
a
little
poem
of
his
et
revenait
the
last
words
of
a
dying
girl
forsaken
by
her
lover
who
is
asked
by
her
sister
what
shall
be
told
to
the
faithless
one
should
he
ever
seek
to
know
of
her
last
hours
et
encore
sur
la
derniere
heure
dites
lui
que
souri
de
peur
ne
pleure
touch
perhaps
the
very
mark
of
exquisite
simplicity
and
tenderness
blent
with
matchless
beauty
of
expression
pelleas
et
melisande
was
the
culminating
point
of
this
his
first
period
a
simple
pathetic
of
boy
and
girl
love
that
was
pure
and
almost
passionless
it
was
followed
by
three
little
plays
for
marionettes
he
describes
them
on
the
among
them
being
la
mort
de
tintagiles
the
play
he
himself
prefers
of
all
that
he
has
written
and
then
came
a
curious
change
he
wrote
aglavaine
et
selysette
the
setting
is
familiar
to
us
the
the
ruined
tower
the
seat
by
the
well
no
less
than
the
old
grandmother
and
little
yssaline
but
aglavaine
herself
is
strange
this
woman
who
has
lived
and
suffered
this
queenly
majestic
creature
calmly
conscious
of
her
beauty
and
her
power
she
whose
overpowering
overwhelming
love
is
yet
deliberate
and
thoughtful
the
complexities
of
real
life
are
vaguely
hinted
at
here
instead
of
golaud
the
mediaeval
tyrannous
husband
we
have
selysette
the
meek
wife
instead
of
the
instinctive
unconscious
love
of
pelleas
and
melisande
we
have
great
burning
passion
but
this
play
too
was
only
a
a
link
between
the
old
method
and
the
new
that
is
to
follow
for
there
will
probably
be
no
more
plays
like
pelleas
et
melisande
or
even
like
aglavaine
et
selysette
real
men
and
women
real
problems
and
disturbance
of
life
it
is
these
that
absorb
him
now
his
next
play
will
doubtless
deal
with
a
psychology
more
actual
in
an
atmosphere
less
romantic
and
the
old
familiar
scene
of
wood
and
garden
and
palace
corridor
will
be
exchanged
for
the
habitual
abode
of
men
i
have
said
it
was
real
life
that
absorbed
him
now
and
yet
am
i
aware
that
what
seems
real
to
him
must
still
appear
vague
and
visionary
to
many
it
is
however
only
a
question
of
shifting
one
point
of
view
or
better
still
of
enlarging
it
material
success
in
life
fame
wealth
these
things
maeterlinck
passes
indifferently
by
there
are
certain
ideals
that
are
dear
to
many
on
which
he
looks
with
the
vague
wonder
of
a
child
the
happiness
of
which
he
dreams
is
an
inward
happiness
and
within
reach
of
successful
and
unsuccessful
alike
and
so
it
may
well
be
that
those
content
to
buffet
with
their
fellows
for
what
are
looked
on
as
the
prizes
of
this
world
will
still
write
him
down
a
mere
visionary
and
fail
to
comprehend
him
the
materialist
who
complacently
defines
the
soul
as
the
intellect
plus
the
emotions
will
doubtless
turn
away
in
disgust
from
maeterlinck
constant
references
to
it
as
the
seat
of
something
mighty
mysterious
inexhaustible
in
life
so
too
may
the
rigid
follower
of
positive
religion
to
whom
the
deity
is
a
power
concerned
only
with
the
judgment
reward
and
punishment
of
men
protest
at
his
saying
that
god
who
must
be
at
least
as
high
as
the
highest
thoughts
he
has
implanted
in
the
best
of
men
will
withhold
his
smile
from
those
whose
sole
desire
has
been
to
please
him
and
they
only
who
have
done
good
for
sake
of
good
and
as
though
he
existed
not
they
only
who
have
loved
virtue
more
than
they
loved
god
himself
shall
be
allowed
to
stand
by
his
side
but
after
all
the
genuine
seeker
after
truth
knows
that
what
seemed
true
yesterday
is
discovered
to
be
only
a
milestone
on
the
road
and
all
who
value
truth
will
be
glad
to
listen
to
a
man
who
differing
from
them
perhaps
yet
tells
them
what
seems
true
to
him
and
whereas
in
the
treasure
of
the
humble
he
looked
on
life
through
a
veil
of
poetry
and
dream
here
he
stands
among
his
no
longer
trying
to
express
the
inexpressible
but
in
all
simplicity
to
tell
them
what
he
sees
above
all
let
us
never
forget
that
an
act
of
goodness
is
in
itself
an
act
of
happiness
it
is
the
flower
of
a
long
inner
life
of
joy
and
contentment
it
tells
of
peaceful
hours
and
days
on
the
sunniest
heights
of
our
soul
this
thought
lies
at
the
root
of
his
whole
philosophy
goodness
happiness
love
supporting
each
other
intertwined
rewarding
each
other
let
us
not
think
virtue
will
crumble
though
god
himself
seem
unjust
where
could
the
virtue
of
man
find
more
everlasting
foundation
than
in
the
seeming
injustice
of
god
strange
that
the
man
who
has
written
these
words
should
have
spent
all
his
school
life
at
a
jesuit
college
subjected
to
its
severe
discipline
compelled
at
the
end
of
his
stay
to
go
with
the
rest
of
his
fellows
through
the
customary
period
of
retreat
lasting
ten
days
when
the
most
eloquent
of
the
fathers
would
one
after
the
other
deliver
sermons
terrific
to
boyish
imagination
sermons
whose
unvarying
burden
was
hell
and
the
wrath
of
god
to
be
avoided
only
by
becoming
a
jesuit
priest
out
of
the
eighteen
boys
in
the
rhetorique
class
eleven
eagerly
embraced
this
chance
of
escape
from
damnation
as
for
maeterlinck
himself
fortunately
a
only
one
can
fancy
him
wandering
home
at
night
along
the
canal
banks
in
the
silence
broken
only
by
the
pealing
of
church
bells
brooding
over
these
mysteries
but
how
long
a
road
must
the
man
have
travelled
who
having
been
taught
the
god
of
fra
angelico
himself
arrives
at
the
conception
of
a
god
who
sits
smiling
on
a
mountain
and
to
whom
our
gravest
offences
are
only
as
the
naughtiness
of
puppies
playing
on
the
his
environment
no
less
than
his
schooling
helped
to
give
a
mystic
tinge
to
his
mind
the
peasants
who
dwelt
around
his
father
house
always
possessed
a
peculiar
fascination
for
him
he
would
watch
them
as
they
sat
by
their
doorway
squatting
on
their
heels
as
their
custom
is
grave
monotonous
motionless
the
smoke
from
their
pipes
almost
the
sole
sign
of
life
for
the
flemish
peasant
is
a
strangely
inert
creature
his
work
once
done
as
languid
and
lethargic
as
the
canal
that
passes
by
his
door
there
was
one
cottage
into
which
the
boy
would
often
peep
on
his
way
home
from
school
the
home
of
seven
brothers
and
one
sister
all
old
toothless
worn
working
together
in
the
daytime
at
their
tiny
farm
at
night
sitting
in
the
gloomy
kitchen
lit
by
one
smoky
lamp
all
looking
straight
before
them
saying
not
a
word
or
when
at
rare
intervals
a
remark
was
made
taking
it
up
each
in
turn
and
solemnly
repeating
it
with
perhaps
the
slightest
variation
in
form
it
was
amidst
influences
such
as
these
that
his
boyhood
was
passed
almost
isolated
from
the
world
brooding
over
lives
of
saints
and
mystics
at
the
same
time
that
he
studied
and
delighted
in
shakespeare
and
the
elizabethans
goethe
and
heine
for
his
taste
has
been
catholic
always
he
admires
meredith
as
he
admires
dickens
hello
and
pascal
no
less
than
schopenhauer
and
it
is
this
catholicity
this
open
mind
this
eager
search
for
truth
that
have
enabled
him
to
emerge
from
the
mysticism
that
once
enwrapped
him
to
the
clearer
daylight
of
actual
existence
it
is
this
faculty
of
admiring
all
that
is
admirable
in
man
and
in
life
that
some
day
perhaps
may
take
him
very
far
it
will
surprise
many
who
picture
him
as
a
mere
dreamy
decadent
to
be
told
that
he
is
a
man
of
abiding
and
abundant
cheerfulness
who
finds
happiness
in
the
simplest
of
things
the
scent
of
a
flower
the
flight
of
around
a
cliff
a
cornfield
in
sunshine
these
stir
him
to
strange
delight
a
deed
of
bravery
nobility
or
of
simple
devotion
a
mere
brotherly
act
of
kindness
the
unconscious
sacrifice
of
the
peasant
who
toils
all
day
to
feed
and
clothe
his
children
these
awake
his
warm
and
instant
sympathy
and
with
him
too
it
is
as
with
de
quincey
when
he
says
at
no
time
of
my
life
have
i
been
a
person
to
hold
myself
polluted
by
the
touch
or
approach
of
any
creature
that
wore
a
human
shape
and
more
than
one
unhappy
outcast
condemned
by
the
stern
law
of
man
has
been
gladdened
by
his
ready
greeting
and
welcome
but
indeed
all
this
may
be
read
of
in
his
book
i
desired
but
to
make
it
clear
that
the
book
is
truly
a
faithful
mirror
of
the
man
own
thoughts
and
feelings
and
actions
it
is
a
book
that
many
will
love
all
those
who
suffer
for
it
will
lighten
their
suffering
all
those
who
love
for
it
will
teach
them
to
love
more
deeply
it
is
a
book
with
its
faults
doubtless
as
every
book
must
be
but
it
has
been
written
straight
from
the
heart
and
will
go
to
the
heart
of
many
alfred
sutro
wisdom
and
destiny
in
this
book
there
will
often
be
mention
of
wisdom
and
destiny
of
happiness
justice
and
love
there
may
seem
to
be
some
measure
of
irony
in
thus
calling
forth
an
intangible
happiness
where
so
much
real
sorrow
prevails
a
justice
that
may
well
be
ideal
in
the
bosom
of
an
injustice
alas
only
too
material
a
love
that
eludes
the
grasp
in
the
midst
of
palpable
hatred
and
callousness
the
moment
may
seem
but
for
leisurely
search
in
the
hidden
recess
of
man
heart
for
motives
of
peace
and
tranquillity
occasions
for
gladness
uplifting
and
love
reasons
for
wonder
and
gratitude
seeing
that
the
vast
bulk
of
mankind
in
whose
name
we
would
fain
lift
our
voice
have
not
even
the
time
or
assurance
to
drain
to
the
dregs
the
misery
and
desolation
of
life
not
to
them
is
it
given
to
linger
over
the
inward
rejoicing
the
profound
consolation
that
the
satisfied
thinker
has
slowly
and
painfully
acquired
that
he
knows
how
to
prize
thus
has
it
often
been
urged
against
moralists
among
them
epictetus
that
they
were
apt
to
concern
themselves
with
none
but
the
wise
alone
in
this
reproach
is
some
truth
as
some
truth
there
must
be
in
every
reproach
that
is
made
and
indeed
if
we
had
only
the
courage
to
listen
to
the
simplest
the
nearest
most
pressing
voice
of
our
conscience
and
be
deaf
to
all
else
it
were
doubtless
our
solitary
duty
to
relieve
the
suffering
about
us
to
the
greatest
extent
in
our
power
it
were
incumbent
upon
us
to
visit
and
nurse
the
poor
to
console
the
afflicted
to
found
model
factories
surgeries
dispensaries
or
at
least
to
devote
ourselves
as
men
of
science
do
to
wresting
from
nature
the
material
secrets
which
are
most
essential
to
man
but
yet
were
the
world
at
a
given
moment
to
contain
only
persons
thus
actively
engaged
in
helping
each
other
and
none
venturesome
enough
to
dare
snatch
leisure
for
research
in
other
directions
then
could
this
charitable
labour
not
long
endure
for
all
that
is
best
in
the
good
that
at
this
day
is
being
done
round
about
us
was
conceived
in
the
spirit
of
one
of
those
who
neglected
it
may
be
many
an
urgent
immediate
duty
in
order
to
think
to
commune
with
themselves
in
order
to
speak
does
it
follow
that
they
did
the
best
that
was
to
be
done
to
such
a
question
as
this
who
shall
dare
to
reply
the
soul
that
is
meekly
honest
must
ever
consider
the
simplest
the
nearest
duty
to
be
the
best
of
all
things
it
can
do
but
yet
were
there
cause
for
regret
had
all
men
for
all
time
restricted
themselves
to
the
duty
that
lay
nearest
at
hand
in
each
generation
some
men
have
existed
who
held
in
all
loyalty
that
they
fulfilled
the
duties
of
the
passing
hour
by
pondering
on
those
of
the
hour
to
come
most
thinkers
will
say
that
these
men
were
right
it
is
well
that
the
thinker
should
give
his
thoughts
to
the
world
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
wisdom
befinds
itself
sometimes
in
the
reverse
of
the
sage
pronouncement
this
matters
but
little
however
for
without
such
pronouncement
the
wisdom
had
not
stood
revealed
and
the
sage
has
accomplished
his
duty
misery
is
the
disease
of
mankind
as
disease
is
the
misery
of
man
and
even
as
there
are
physicians
for
disease
so
should
there
be
physicians
for
human
misery
but
can
the
fact
that
disease
is
unhappily
only
too
prevalent
render
it
wrong
for
us
ever
to
speak
of
health
which
were
indeed
as
though
in
anatomy
the
physical
science
that
has
most
in
common
with
morals
the
teacher
confined
himself
exclusively
to
the
study
of
the
deformities
that
greater
or
lesser
degeneration
will
induce
in
the
organs
of
man
we
have
surely
the
right
to
demand
that
his
theories
be
based
on
the
healthy
and
vigorous
body
as
we
have
also
the
right
to
demand
that
the
moralist
who
fain
would
see
beyond
the
present
hour
should
take
as
his
standard
the
soul
that
is
happy
or
that
at
least
possesses
every
element
of
happiness
save
only
the
necessary
consciousness
we
live
in
the
bosom
of
great
injustice
but
there
can
be
i
imagine
neither
cruelty
nor
callousness
in
our
speaking
at
times
as
though
this
injustice
had
ended
else
should
we
never
emerge
from
our
circle
it
is
imperative
that
there
should
be
some
who
dare
speak
and
think
and
act
as
though
all
men
were
happy
for
otherwise
when
the
day
comes
for
destiny
to
throw
open
to
all
the
people
garden
of
the
promised
land
what
happiness
shall
the
others
find
there
what
justice
what
beauty
or
love
it
may
be
urged
it
is
true
that
it
were
best
first
of
all
to
consider
the
most
pressing
needs
yet
is
this
not
always
wisest
it
is
often
of
better
avail
from
the
start
to
seek
that
which
is
highest
when
the
waters
beleaguer
the
home
of
the
peasant
in
holland
the
sea
or
the
neighbouring
river
having
swept
down
the
dyke
that
protected
the
country
most
pressing
is
it
then
for
the
peasant
to
safeguard
his
cattle
his
grain
his
effects
but
wisest
to
fly
to
the
top
of
the
dyke
summoning
those
who
live
with
him
and
from
thence
meet
the
flood
and
do
battle
humanity
up
to
this
day
has
been
like
an
invalid
tossing
and
turning
on
his
couch
in
search
of
repose
but
therefore
none
the
less
have
words
of
true
consolation
come
only
from
those
who
spoke
as
though
man
were
freed
from
all
pain
for
as
man
was
created
for
health
so
was
mankind
created
for
happiness
and
to
speak
of
its
misery
only
though
that
misery
be
everywhere
and
seem
everlasting
is
only
to
say
words
that
fall
lightly
and
soon
are
forgotten
why
not
speak
as
though
mankind
were
always
on
the
eve
of
great
certitude
of
great
joy
thither
in
truth
is
man
led
by
his
instinct
though
he
never
may
live
to
behold
the
it
is
well
to
believe
that
there
needs
but
a
little
more
thought
a
little
more
courage
more
love
more
devotion
to
life
a
little
more
eagerness
one
day
to
fling
open
wide
the
portals
of
joy
and
of
truth
and
this
thing
may
still
come
to
pass
let
us
hope
that
one
day
all
mankind
will
be
happy
and
wise
and
though
this
day
never
should
dawn
to
have
hoped
for
it
can
not
be
wrong
and
in
any
event
it
is
helpful
to
speak
of
happiness
to
those
who
are
sad
that
thus
at
least
they
may
learn
what
it
is
that
happiness
means
they
are
ever
inclined
to
regard
it
as
something
beyond
them
extraordinary
out
of
their
reach
but
if
all
who
may
count
themselves
happy
were
to
tell
very
simply
what
it
was
that
brought
happiness
to
them
the
others
would
see
that
between
sorrow
and
joy
the
difference
is
but
as
between
a
gladsome
enlightened
acceptance
of
life
and
a
hostile
gloomy
submission
between
a
large
and
harmonious
conception
of
life
and
one
that
is
stubborn
and
narrow
is
that
all
the
unhappy
would
cry
but
we
too
have
within
us
then
the
elements
of
this
happiness
surely
you
have
them
within
you
there
lives
not
a
man
but
has
them
those
only
excepted
upon
whom
great
physical
calamity
has
fallen
but
speak
not
lightly
of
this
happiness
there
is
no
other
he
is
the
happiest
man
who
best
understands
his
happiness
for
he
is
of
all
men
most
fully
aware
that
it
is
only
the
lofty
idea
the
untiring
courageous
human
idea
that
separates
gladness
from
sorrow
of
this
idea
it
is
helpful
to
speak
and
as
often
as
may
be
not
with
the
view
of
imposing
our
own
idea
upon
others
but
in
order
that
they
who
may
listen
shall
little
by
little
conceive
the
desire
to
possess
an
idea
of
their
own
for
in
no
two
men
is
it
the
same
the
one
that
you
cherish
may
well
bring
no
comfort
to
me
nor
shall
all
your
eloquence
touch
the
hidden
springs
of
my
life
needs
must
i
acquire
my
own
in
myself
by
myself
but
you
unconsciously
make
this
the
easier
for
me
by
telling
of
the
idea
that
is
yours
it
may
happen
that
i
shall
find
solace
in
that
which
brings
sorrow
to
you
and
that
which
to
you
speaks
of
gladness
may
be
fraught
with
affliction
for
me
but
no
matter
into
my
grief
will
enter
all
that
you
saw
of
beauty
and
comfort
and
into
my
joy
there
will
pass
all
that
was
great
in
your
sadness
if
indeed
my
joy
be
on
the
same
plane
as
your
sadness
it
behoves
us
the
first
thing
of
all
to
prepare
in
our
soul
a
place
of
some
loftiness
where
this
idea
may
be
lodged
as
the
priests
of
ancient
religions
laid
the
mountain
peak
bare
and
cleared
it
of
thorn
and
of
root
for
the
fire
to
descend
from
heaven
there
may
come
to
us
any
day
from
the
depths
of
the
planet
mars
the
infallible
formula
of
happiness
conveyed
in
the
final
truth
as
to
the
aim
and
the
government
of
the
universe
such
a
formula
could
only
bring
change
or
advancement
unto
our
spiritual
life
in
the
degree
of
the
desire
and
expectation
of
advancement
in
which
we
might
long
have
been
living
the
formula
would
be
the
same
for
all
men
yet
would
each
one
benefit
only
in
the
proportion
of
the
eagerness
purity
unselfishness
knowledge
that
he
had
stored
up
in
his
soul
all
morality
all
study
of
justice
and
happiness
should
truly
be
no
more
than
preparation
provision
on
the
vastest
scale
a
way
of
gaining
experience
a
laid
down
for
what
is
to
follow
surely
desirable
day
of
all
days
were
the
one
when
at
last
we
should
live
in
absolute
truth
in
immovable
logical
certitude
but
in
the
meantime
it
is
given
us
to
live
in
a
truth
more
important
still
the
truth
of
our
soul
and
our
character
and
some
wise
men
have
proved
that
this
life
can
be
lived
in
the
midst
of
gravest
material
errors
is
it
idle
to
speak
of
justice
happiness
morals
and
all
things
connected
therewith
before
the
hour
of
science
has
sounded
that
definitive
hour
wherein
all
that
we
cling
to
may
crumble
the
darkness
that
hangs
over
our
life
will
then
it
may
be
pass
away
and
much
that
we
do
in
the
darkness
shall
be
otherwise
done
in
the
light
but
nevertheless
do
the
essential
events
of
our
moral
and
physical
life
come
to
pass
in
the
darkness
as
completely
as
inevitably
as
they
would
in
the
light
our
life
must
be
lived
while
we
wait
for
the
word
that
shall
solve
the
enigma
and
the
happier
the
nobler
our
life
the
more
vigorous
shall
it
become
and
we
shall
have
the
more
courage
boldness
to
seek
and
desire
the
truth
and
happen
what
may
the
time
can
be
never
that
we
give
to
acquiring
some
knowledge
of
self
whatever
our
relation
may
become
to
this
world
in
which
we
have
being
in
our
soul
there
will
yet
be
more
feelings
more
passions
more
secrets
unchanged
and
unchanging
than
there
are
stars
that
connect
with
the
earth
or
mysteries
fathomed
by
science
in
the
bosom
of
truth
undeniable
truth
all
absorbing
man
shall
doubtless
soar
upwards
but
still
as
he
rises
still
shall
his
soul
unerringly
guide
him
and
the
grander
the
truth
of
the
universe
the
more
solace
and
peace
it
may
bring
the
more
shall
the
problems
of
justice
morality
happiness
love
present
to
the
eyes
of
all
men
the
semblance
they
ever
have
worn
in
the
eyes
of
the
thinker
we
should
live
as
though
we
were
always
on
the
eve
of
the
great
revelation
and
we
should
be
ready
with
welcome
with
warmest
and
keenest
and
fullest
most
heartfelt
and
intimate
welcome
and
whatever
the
form
it
shall
take
on
the
day
that
it
comes
to
us
the
best
way
of
all
to
prepare
for
its
fitting
reception
is
to
crave
for
it
now
to
desire
it
as
lofty
as
perfect
as
vast
as
ennobling
as
the
soul
can
conceive
it
must
needs
be
more
beautiful
glorious
and
ample
than
the
best
of
our
hopes
for
where
it
differ
therefrom
or
even
frustrate
them
it
must
of
necessity
bring
something
nobler
loftier
nearer
to
the
nature
of
man
for
it
will
bring
us
the
truth
to
man
though
all
that
he
value
go
under
the
intimate
truth
of
the
universe
must
be
wholly
preeminently
admirable
and
though
on
the
day
it
unveils
our
meekest
desires
turn
to
ashes
and
float
on
the
wind
still
shall
there
linger
within
us
all
we
have
prepared
and
the
admirable
will
enter
our
soul
the
volume
of
its
waters
being
as
the
depth
of
the
channel
that
our
expectation
has
fashioned
is
it
necessary
that
we
should
conceive
ourselves
to
be
superior
to
the
universe
our
reason
may
prove
what
it
will
our
reason
is
only
a
feeble
ray
that
has
issued
from
nature
a
tiny
atom
of
that
whole
which
nature
alone
shall
judge
is
it
fitting
that
the
ray
of
light
should
desire
to
alter
the
lamp
whence
it
springs
that
loftiness
within
us
from
whose
summit
we
venture
to
pass
judgment
on
the
totality
of
life
to
absolve
or
condemn
it
is
doubtless
the
merest
visible
to
our
eye
alone
on
the
illimitable
sphere
of
life
it
is
wise
to
think
and
to
act
as
though
all
that
happened
to
man
were
all
that
man
most
required
it
is
not
long
ago
to
cite
only
one
of
the
problems
that
the
instinct
of
our
planet
is
invited
to
solve
that
a
scheme
was
on
foot
to
inquire
of
the
thinkers
of
europe
whether
it
should
rightly
be
held
as
a
gain
or
a
loss
to
mankind
if
an
energetic
strenuous
persistent
race
which
some
through
prejudice
doubtless
still
regard
as
inferior
to
the
aryan
in
qualities
of
heart
and
of
soul
if
the
jews
in
a
word
were
to
vanish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
or
to
acquire
preponderance
there
i
am
satisfied
that
the
sage
might
answer
without
laying
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
indifference
or
undue
resignation
in
what
comes
to
pass
will
be
happiness
many
things
happen
that
seem
unjust
to
us
but
of
all
the
achievements
of
reason
there
has
been
none
so
helpful
as
the
discovery
of
the
loftier
reason
that
underlies
the
misdeeds
of
nature
it
is
from
the
slow
and
gradual
vindication
of
the
unknown
force
that
we
deemed
at
first
to
be
pitiless
that
our
moral
and
physical
life
has
derived
its
chief
prop
and
support
if
a
race
disappears
that
conforms
with
our
every
ideal
it
will
be
only
because
our
ideal
still
falls
short
of
the
grand
ideal
which
is
as
we
have
said
the
intimate
truth
of
the
universe
our
own
experience
has
taught
us
that
even
in
this
world
of
reality
there
exist
dreams
and
desires
thoughts
and
feelings
of
beauty
of
justice
and
love
that
are
of
the
noblest
and
loftiest
and
if
there
be
any
that
shrink
from
the
test
of
reality
in
other
words
from
the
mysterious
nameless
power
of
life
it
follows
that
these
must
be
different
but
not
that
their
beauty
is
less
or
their
vastness
or
power
to
console
till
reality
confront
us
it
is
well
it
may
be
to
cherish
ideals
that
we
hold
to
surpass
it
in
beauty
but
once
face
to
face
with
reality
then
must
the
ideal
flame
that
has
fed
on
our
noblest
desires
be
content
to
throw
faithful
light
on
the
less
fragile
less
tender
beauty
of
the
mighty
mass
that
crushes
these
desires
nor
does
this
seem
to
me
to
imply
a
mere
drowsy
fatalism
or
servile
acquiescence
or
optimism
shrinking
from
action
the
sage
no
doubt
must
many
a
time
forfeit
some
measure
of
the
blind
the
fanatical
zeal
that
has
enabled
some
men
whose
reason
was
fettered
and
bound
to
achieve
results
that
are
nigh
superhuman
but
therefore
none
the
less
is
it
certain
that
no
man
of
upright
soul
should
go
forth
in
search
of
illusion
or
blindness
of
zeal
or
vigour
in
a
region
inferior
to
that
of
his
noblest
hours
to
do
our
true
duty
in
life
it
must
ever
be
done
with
the
aid
of
all
that
is
highest
in
our
soul
highest
in
the
truth
that
is
ours
and
even
though
it
be
permissible
at
times
in
actual
life
to
compromise
with
events
and
not
follow
impulse
to
the
ruthless
end
as
did
just
for
instance
who
in
his
admirable
and
ardent
desire
for
universal
peace
happiness
justice
in
all
good
faith
sent
thousands
to
the
scaffold
in
the
life
of
thought
it
is
our
unvarying
duty
to
pursue
our
thought
right
to
the
end
again
the
knowledge
that
our
actions
still
await
the
seal
of
final
truth
can
deter
from
action
those
only
who
would
have
remained
no
less
inert
had
no
such
knowledge
been
theirs
thought
that
rises
encourages
where
it
disheartens
and
to
those
of
a
loftier
vision
prepared
in
advance
to
admire
the
truth
that
will
nullify
all
they
have
done
it
seems
only
natural
still
to
endeavour
with
all
might
and
main
to
enhance
what
yet
may
be
termed
the
justice
the
beauty
the
reason
of
this
our
earth
they
know
that
to
penetrate
deeper
to
understand
to
respect
all
this
is
enhancement
above
all
they
have
faith
in
the
idea
of
the
universe
they
are
satisfied
that
every
effort
that
tends
to
improvement
approaches
the
secret
intention
of
life
they
are
taught
by
the
failure
of
their
noblest
endeavours
by
the
resistance
of
this
mighty
world
to
discover
anew
fresh
reasons
for
wonder
for
ardour
for
hope
as
you
climb
up
a
mountain
towards
nightfall
the
trees
and
the
houses
the
steeple
the
fields
and
the
orchards
the
road
and
even
the
river
will
gradually
dwindle
and
fade
and
at
last
disappear
in
the
gloom
that
steals
over
the
valley
but
the
threads
of
light
that
shine
from
the
houses
of
men
and
pierce
through
the
blackest
of
nights
these
shine
on
undimmed
and
every
step
that
you
take
to
the
summit
reveals
but
more
lights
and
more
in
the
hamlets
asleep
at
your
foot
for
light
though
so
fragile
is
perhaps
the
one
thing
of
all
that
yields
naught
of
itself
as
it
faces
immensity
thus
it
is
with
our
moral
light
too
when
we
look
upon
life
from
some
slight
elevation
it
is
well
that
reflection
should
teach
us
to
disburden
our
soul
of
base
passions
but
it
should
not
discourage
or
weaken
our
humblest
desire
for
justice
for
truth
and
for
love
whence
comes
this
rule
that
i
thus
propound
nay
i
know
not
myself
to
me
it
seems
helpful
and
requisite
nor
could
i
give
reasons
other
than
spring
from
the
feelings
alone
such
reasons
however
at
times
should
by
no
means
be
treated
too
lightly
if
i
should
ever
attain
a
summit
whence
this
law
seemed
useless
to
me
i
would
listen
to
the
secret
instinct
bidding
me
not
linger
but
climb
on
still
higher
till
its
usefulness
should
once
again
be
clearly
apparent
to
me
this
general
introduction
over
let
us
speak
more
particularly
of
the
influence
that
wisdom
can
have
upon
destiny
and
the
occasion
presenting
itself
here
i
shall
do
well
perhaps
to
state
now
at
the
very
beginning
that
in
this
book
it
will
be
vain
to
seek
for
any
rigorous
method
for
indeed
it
is
but
composed
of
thoughts
that
entwine
themselves
with
more
or
less
system
around
two
or
three
subjects
its
object
is
not
to
convince
there
is
nothing
it
professes
to
prove
besides
in
life
books
have
by
no
means
the
importance
that
writers
and
readers
claim
for
them
we
should
regard
them
as
did
a
friend
of
mine
a
man
of
great
wisdom
who
listened
one
day
to
the
recital
of
the
last
moments
of
the
emperor
antoninus
pius
antoninus
pius
who
was
perhaps
truly
the
best
and
most
perfect
man
this
world
has
known
better
even
than
marcus
aurelius
for
in
addition
to
the
virtues
the
kindness
the
deep
feeling
and
wisdom
of
his
adopted
son
he
had
something
of
greater
virility
and
energy
of
simpler
happiness
something
more
real
spontaneous
closer
to
everyday
life
antoninus
pius
lay
on
his
bed
awaiting
the
summons
of
death
his
eyes
dim
with
unbidden
tears
his
limbs
moist
with
the
pale
sweat
of
agony
at
that
moment
there
entered
the
captain
of
the
guard
come
to
demand
the
watchword
such
being
the
custom
aequanimitas
evenness
of
mind
he
replied
as
he
turned
his
head
to
the
eternal
shadow
it
is
well
that
we
should
love
and
admire
that
word
said
my
friend
but
better
still
he
added
to
have
it
in
us
to
sacrifice
unknown
to
others
unknown
even
to
ourselves
the
time
fortune
accords
us
wherein
to
admire
it
in
favour
of
the
first
little
useful
living
deed
that
the
same
fortune
incessantly
offers
to
every
willing
heart
it
was
doubtless
the
will
of
their
destiny
that
men
and
events
should
oppress
them
whithersoever
they
went
said
an
author
of
the
heroes
of
his
book
thus
it
is
with
the
majority
of
men
indeed
with
all
those
who
have
not
yet
learned
to
distinguish
between
exterior
and
moral
destiny
they
are
like
a
little
bewildered
stream
that
i
chanced
to
espy
one
evening
as
i
stood
on
the
hillside
i
beheld
it
far
down
in
the
valley
staggering
struggling
climbing
falling
blindly
groping
its
way
to
the
great
lake
that
slumbered
the
other
side
of
the
forest
in
the
peace
of
the
dawn
here
it
was
a
block
of
basalt
that
forced
the
streamlet
to
wind
round
and
about
four
times
there
the
roots
of
a
hoary
tree
further
on
still
the
mere
recollection
of
an
obstacle
now
gone
for
ever
thrust
it
back
to
its
source
bubbling
in
impotent
fury
divided
for
all
time
from
its
goal
and
its
gladness
but
in
another
direction
at
right
angles
almost
to
the
distraught
unhappy
useless
stream
a
force
superior
to
the
force
of
instinct
had
traced
a
long
greenish
canal
calm
peaceful
deliberate
that
flowed
steadily
across
the
country
across
the
crumbling
stones
across
the
obedient
forest
on
its
clear
and
unerring
unhurrying
way
from
its
distant
source
on
the
horizon
to
the
same
tranquil
shining
lake
and
i
had
at
my
feet
before
me
the
image
of
the
two
great
destinies
offered
to
man
side
by
side
with
those
whom
men
and
events
oppress
there
are
others
who
have
within
them
some
kind
of
inner
force
which
has
its
will
not
only
with
men
but
even
with
the
events
that
surround
them
of
this
force
they
are
fully
aware
and
indeed
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
knowledge
of
self
that
has
far
overstepped
the
ordinary
limits
of
consciousness
our
consciousness
is
our
home
our
refuge
from
the
caprice
of
fate
our
centre
of
happiness
and
strength
but
these
things
have
been
said
so
often
that
we
need
do
no
more
than
refer
to
them
and
indicate
them
as
our
ennoblement
comes
to
man
in
the
degree
that
his
consciousness
quickens
and
the
nobler
the
man
has
become
the
profounder
must
consciousness
be
admirable
exchange
takes
place
here
and
even
as
love
is
insatiable
in
its
craving
for
love
so
is
consciousness
insatiable
in
its
craving
for
growth
for
moral
uplifting
and
moral
uplifting
for
ever
is
yearning
for
consciousness
but
this
knowledge
of
self
is
only
too
often
regarded
as
implying
no
more
than
a
knowledge
of
our
defects
and
our
qualities
whereas
it
does
indeed
extend
infinitely
further
to
mysteries
vastly
more
helpful
to
know
oneself
in
repose
suffices
not
nor
does
it
suffice
to
know
oneself
in
the
past
or
the
present
those
within
whom
lies
the
force
that
i
speak
of
know
themselves
in
the
future
too
consciousness
of
self
with
the
greatest
of
men
implies
consciousness
up
to
a
point
of
their
star
or
their
destiny
they
are
aware
of
some
part
of
their
future
because
they
have
already
become
part
of
this
future
they
have
faith
in
themselves
for
they
know
in
advance
how
events
will
be
received
in
their
soul
the
event
in
itself
is
pure
water
that
flows
from
the
pitcher
of
fate
and
seldom
has
it
either
savour
or
perfume
or
colour
but
even
as
the
soul
may
be
wherein
it
seeks
shelter
so
will
the
event
become
joyous
or
sad
become
tender
or
hateful
become
deadly
or
quick
with
life
to
those
round
about
us
there
happen
incessant
and
countless
adventures
whereof
every
one
it
would
seem
contains
a
germ
of
heroism
but
the
adventure
passes
away
and
heroic
deed
is
there
none
but
when
jesus
christ
met
the
samaritan
met
a
few
children
an
adulterous
woman
then
did
humanity
rise
three
times
in
succession
to
the
level
of
god
it
might
almost
be
said
that
there
happens
to
men
only
that
they
desire
it
is
true
that
on
certain
external
events
our
influence
is
of
the
feeblest
but
we
have
action
on
that
which
these
events
shall
become
in
ourselves
in
other
words
on
their
spiritual
part
on
what
is
radiant
undying
within
them
there
are
thousands
of
men
within
whom
this
spiritual
part
that
is
craving
for
birth
in
every
misfortune
or
love
or
chance
meeting
has
known
not
one
moment
of
life
these
men
pass
away
like
a
straw
on
the
stream
and
others
there
are
within
whom
this
immortal
part
absorbs
all
these
are
like
islands
that
have
sprung
up
in
the
ocean
for
they
have
found
immovable
anchorage
whence
they
issue
commands
that
their
destiny
needs
must
obey
the
life
of
most
men
will
be
saddened
or
lightened
by
the
thing
that
may
chance
to
befall
them
in
the
men
whom
i
speak
of
whatever
may
happen
is
lit
up
by
their
inward
life
when
you
love
it
is
not
your
love
that
forms
part
of
your
destiny
but
the
knowledge
of
self
that
you
will
have
found
deep
down
in
your
love
this
it
is
that
will
help
to
fashion
your
life
if
you
have
been
deceived
it
is
not
the
deception
that
matters
but
the
forgiveness
whereto
it
gave
birth
in
your
soul
and
the
loftiness
wisdom
completeness
of
this
forgiveness
by
these
shall
your
life
be
steered
to
destiny
haven
of
brightness
and
peace
by
these
shall
your
eyes
see
more
clearly
than
if
all
men
had
ever
been
faithful
but
if
by
this
act
of
deceit
there
have
come
not
more
simpleness
loftier
faith
wider
range
to
your
love
then
have
you
been
deceived
in
vain
and
may
truly
say
nothing
has
happened
let
us
always
remember
that
nothing
befalls
us
that
is
not
of
the
nature
of
ourselves
there
comes
no
adventure
but
wears
to
our
soul
the
shape
of
our
everyday
thoughts
and
deeds
of
heroism
are
but
offered
to
those
who
for
many
long
years
have
been
heroes
in
obscurity
and
silence
and
whether
you
climb
up
the
mountain
or
go
down
the
hill
to
the
valley
whether
you
journey
to
the
end
of
the
world
or
merely
walk
round
your
house
none
but
yourself
shall
you
meet
on
the
highway
of
fate
if
judas
go
forth
it
is
towards
judas
his
steps
will
tend
nor
will
chance
for
betrayal
be
lacking
but
let
socrates
open
his
door
he
shall
find
socrates
asleep
on
the
threshold
before
him
and
there
will
be
occasion
for
wisdom
our
adventures
hover
around
us
like
bees
round
the
hive
when
preparing
to
swarm
they
wait
till
the
has
at
last
come
forth
from
our
soul
and
no
sooner
has
she
appeared
than
they
all
come
rushing
towards
her
be
false
and
falsehoods
will
haste
to
you
love
and
adventures
will
flock
to
you
throbbing
with
love
they
seem
to
be
all
on
the
watch
for
the
signal
we
hoist
from
within
and
if
the
soul
grow
wiser
towards
evening
the
sorrow
will
grow
wiser
too
that
the
soul
had
fashioned
for
itself
in
the
morning
no
great
inner
event
befalls
those
who
summon
it
not
and
yet
is
there
germ
of
great
inner
event
in
the
smallest
occurrence
of
life
but
events
such
as
these
are
apportioned
by
justice
and
to
each
man
is
given
of
the
spoil
in
accord
with
his
merits
we
become
that
which
we
discover
in
the
sorrows
and
joys
that
befall
us
and
the
least
expected
caprices
of
fate
soon
mould
themselves
on
our
thoughts
it
is
in
our
past
that
destiny
finds
all
her
weapons
her
vestments
her
jewels
were
the
only
son
of
thersites
and
socrates
to
die
the
same
day
socrates
grief
would
in
no
way
resemble
the
grief
of
thersites
misfortune
or
happiness
it
seems
must
be
chastened
ere
it
knock
at
the
door
of
the
sage
but
only
by
stooping
low
can
it
enter
the
commonplace
soul
as
we
become
wiser
we
escape
some
of
our
instinctive
destinies
there
is
in
us
all
sufficient
desire
for
wisdom
to
transform
into
consciousness
most
of
the
hazards
of
life
and
all
that
has
thus
been
transformed
can
belong
no
more
to
the
hostile
powers
a
sorrow
your
soul
has
changed
into
sweetness
to
indulgence
or
patient
smiles
is
a
sorrow
that
shall
never
return
without
spiritual
ornament
and
a
fault
or
defect
you
have
looked
in
the
face
can
harm
you
no
more
or
even
be
harmful
to
others
instinct
and
destiny
are
for
ever
conferring
together
they
support
one
another
and
rove
hand
in
hand
round
the
man
who
is
not
on
his
guard
and
whoever
is
able
to
curb
the
blind
force
of
instinct
within
him
is
able
to
curb
the
force
of
external
destiny
also
he
seems
to
create
some
kind
of
sanctuary
whose
inviolability
will
be
in
the
degree
of
his
wisdom
and
the
consciousness
he
has
acquired
becomes
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
light
within
which
the
is
secure
from
the
caprice
of
fate
had
jesus
christ
or
socrates
dwelt
in
palace
among
the
atrides
then
had
there
been
no
oresteia
nor
would
oedipus
ever
have
dreamed
of
destroying
his
sight
if
they
had
been
tranquilly
seated
on
the
threshold
of
jocasta
abode
fatality
shrinks
back
abashed
from
the
should
that
has
more
than
once
conquered
her
there
are
certain
disasters
she
dare
not
send
forth
when
this
soul
is
near
and
the
sage
as
he
passes
by
intervenes
in
numberless
tragedies
the
mere
presence
of
the
sage
suffices
to
paralyse
destiny
and
of
this
we
find
proof
in
the
fact
that
there
exists
scarce
a
drama
wherein
a
true
sage
appears
when
such
is
the
case
the
event
needs
must
halt
before
reaching
bloodshed
and
tears
not
only
is
there
no
drama
wherein
sage
is
in
conflict
with
sage
but
indeed
there
are
very
few
whose
action
revolves
round
a
sage
and
truly
can
we
imagine
that
an
event
shall
turn
into
tragedy
between
men
who
have
earnestly
striven
to
gain
knowledge
of
self
but
the
heroes
of
famous
tragedies
do
not
question
their
souls
profoundly
and
it
follows
therefrom
that
the
beauty
the
tragic
poet
presents
is
only
a
captive
thing
is
fettered
with
chains
for
were
his
heroes
to
soar
to
the
height
the
real
hero
would
gain
their
weapons
would
fall
to
the
ground
and
the
drama
itself
become
peace
the
peace
of
enlightenment
it
is
only
in
the
passion
of
christ
the
phaedo
prometheus
the
murder
of
orpheus
the
sacrifice
of
antigone
it
is
only
in
these
that
we
find
the
drama
of
the
sage
the
solitary
drama
of
wisdom
but
elsewhere
it
is
rarely
indeed
that
tragic
poets
will
allow
a
sage
to
appear
on
the
scene
though
it
be
for
an
instant
they
are
afraid
of
a
lofty
soul
for
they
know
that
events
are
no
less
afraid
and
that
a
murder
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
sage
seems
quite
other
than
the
murder
committed
in
the
presence
of
those
whose
soul
still
knows
not
itself
had
oedipus
possessed
the
inner
refuge
that
marcus
aurelius
for
instance
had
been
able
to
erect
in
himself
a
refuge
whereto
he
could
fly
at
all
times
had
he
only
acquired
some
few
of
the
certitudes
open
to
every
thinker
what
could
destiny
then
have
done
what
would
she
have
entrapped
in
her
snares
would
they
have
contained
aught
besides
the
pure
light
that
streams
from
the
lofty
soul
as
it
grows
more
beautiful
still
in
misfortune
but
where
is
the
sage
in
oedipus
is
it
tiresias
he
reads
the
future
but
knows
not
that
goodness
and
forgiveness
are
lords
of
the
future
he
knows
the
truth
of
the
gods
but
not
the
truth
of
mankind
he
ignores
the
wisdom
that
takes
misfortune
to
her
arms
and
would
fain
give
it
of
her
strength
truly
they
who
know
still
know
nothing
if
the
strength
of
love
be
not
theirs
for
the
true
sage
is
not
he
who
sees
but
he
who
seeing
the
furthest
has
the
deepest
love
for
mankind
he
who
sees
without
loving
is
only
straining
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
we
are
told
that
the
famous
tragedies
show
us
the
struggle
of
man
against
fate
i
believe
on
the
contrary
that
scarcely
a
drama
exists
wherein
fatality
truly
does
reign
search
as
i
may
i
can
not
find
one
which
exhibits
the
hero
in
conflict
with
destiny
pure
and
simple
for
indeed
it
is
never
destiny
that
he
attacks
it
is
with
wisdom
he
is
always
at
war
real
fatality
exists
only
in
certain
external
disease
accident
the
sudden
death
of
those
we
love
but
inner
fatality
there
is
none
wisdom
has
will
power
sufficient
to
rectify
all
that
does
not
deal
death
to
the
body
it
will
even
at
times
invade
the
narrow
domain
of
external
fatality
it
is
true
that
we
must
have
amassed
considerable
and
patient
treasure
within
us
for
this
will
power
to
find
the
resources
it
needs
the
statue
of
destiny
casts
a
huge
shadow
over
the
valley
which
it
seems
to
enshroud
in
gloom
but
this
shadow
has
clearest
outline
for
such
as
look
down
from
the
mountain
we
are
born
it
may
be
with
the
shadow
upon
us
but
to
many
men
is
it
granted
to
emerge
from
beneath
it
and
even
though
infirmity
or
weakness
keep
us
till
death
confined
in
these
sombre
regions
still
we
can
fly
thence
at
times
on
the
wings
of
our
hopes
and
our
thoughts
there
may
well
be
some
few
over
whom
fate
exerts
a
more
tyrannous
power
by
virtue
of
instinct
heredity
and
other
laws
more
relentless
still
more
profound
and
obscure
but
even
when
we
writhe
beneath
unmerited
crushing
misfortune
even
when
fortune
compels
us
to
do
the
thing
we
should
never
have
done
had
our
hands
been
free
even
then
when
the
deed
has
been
done
the
misfortune
has
happened
it
still
rests
with
ourselves
to
deny
her
the
least
influence
on
that
which
shall
come
to
pass
in
our
soul
she
may
strike
at
the
heart
that
is
eager
for
good
but
still
is
she
helpless
to
keep
back
the
light
that
shall
stream
to
this
heart
from
the
error
acknowledged
the
pain
undergone
it
is
not
in
her
power
to
prevent
the
soul
from
transforming
each
single
affliction
into
thoughts
into
feelings
and
treasure
she
dare
not
profane
be
her
empire
never
so
great
over
all
things
external
she
always
must
halt
when
she
finds
on
the
threshold
a
silent
guardian
of
the
inner
life
and
if
it
be
granted
her
then
to
pass
through
to
the
hidden
dwelling
it
is
but
as
a
bountiful
guest
she
will
enter
bringing
with
her
new
pledges
of
peace
refreshing
the
slumberous
air
and
making
still
clearer
the
light
the
tranquillity
deeper
illumining
all
the
horizon
let
us
ask
once
again
what
had
destiny
done
if
she
had
by
some
blunder
lured
epicurus
or
marcus
aurelius
or
antoninus
pius
into
the
snares
that
she
laid
around
oedipus
i
will
even
assume
that
she
might
have
compelled
antoninus
for
instance
to
murder
his
father
and
all
unwittingly
to
profane
the
couch
of
his
mother
would
that
noble
sovereign
soul
have
been
hopelessly
crushed
would
the
end
of
it
all
not
have
been
as
the
end
of
all
dramas
must
be
wherein
the
sage
is
attacked
great
sorrow
surely
but
also
great
radiance
that
springs
from
this
sorrow
and
already
is
partly
triumphant
over
the
shadow
of
grief
needs
must
antoninus
have
wept
as
all
men
must
weep
but
tears
can
quench
not
one
ray
in
the
soul
that
shines
with
no
borrowed
light
to
the
sage
the
road
is
long
that
leads
from
grief
to
despair
it
is
a
road
untravelled
by
wisdom
when
the
soul
has
attained
such
loftiness
as
the
life
of
antoninus
shows
us
that
his
had
acquired
then
is
each
falling
tear
illumined
by
beautiful
thought
and
by
generous
feeling
he
would
have
taken
calamity
to
him
to
all
that
was
purest
most
vast
in
his
soul
and
misfortune
like
water
espouses
the
form
of
the
vase
that
contains
it
antoninus
we
say
would
have
brought
resignation
to
bear
but
this
is
a
word
that
too
often
conceals
the
true
working
of
a
noble
heart
there
is
no
soul
so
petty
but
what
it
too
may
believe
that
it
is
resigned
alas
it
is
not
resignation
that
comforts
us
raises
and
chastens
but
indeed
the
thoughts
and
the
feelings
in
whose
name
we
embrace
resignation
and
it
is
here
that
wisdom
doles
out
the
rewards
they
have
earned
to
her
faithful
some
ideas
there
are
that
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
any
catastrophe
he
will
be
far
less
exposed
to
disaster
who
cherishes
ideas
within
him
that
soar
high
above
the
indifference
selfishness
vanities
of
everyday
life
and
therefore
come
happiness
or
sorrow
the
happiest
man
will
be
he
within
whom
the
greatest
idea
shall
burn
the
most
ardently
had
fate
so
desired
it
antoninus
also
perhaps
had
been
guilty
of
incest
and
parricide
but
his
inward
life
would
not
have
been
crushed
thereby
as
was
that
of
oedipus
nay
these
very
catastrophes
would
have
given
him
mightier
strength
and
destiny
would
have
fled
in
despair
strewing
the
ground
by
the
emperor
palace
with
her
nets
and
her
blunted
weapons
for
even
as
triumph
of
dictators
and
consuls
could
be
celebrated
only
in
rome
so
can
the
true
triumph
of
fate
take
place
nowhere
save
in
our
soul
where
do
we
find
the
fatality
in
hamlet
king
lear
in
macbeth
is
its
throne
not
erected
in
the
very
centre
of
the
old
king
madness
on
the
lowest
degree
of
the
young
prince
imagination
at
the
very
summit
of
the
thane
morbid
cravings
macbeth
we
may
well
pass
by
not
need
we
linger
over
cordelia
father
for
his
absence
of
consciousness
is
all
too
manifest
but
hamlet
hamlet
the
thinker
is
he
wise
is
the
elevation
sufficient
wherefrom
he
looks
down
on
the
crimes
of
elsinore
he
seems
to
regard
them
from
the
loftiest
heights
of
his
intellect
but
in
the
mountain
range
of
wisdom
there
are
other
peaks
that
tower
far
above
the
heights
of
the
intellect
the
peaks
of
goodness
and
confidence
of
indulgence
and
love
if
he
could
have
surveyed
the
misdeeds
of
elsinore
from
the
eminence
whence
marcus
aurelius
or
fenelon
for
instance
had
surely
surveyed
them
what
would
have
resulted
then
and
first
of
all
does
it
not
often
happen
that
a
crime
which
is
suddenly
conscious
of
the
gaze
of
a
mightier
soul
will
pause
and
halt
and
at
last
crawl
back
to
its
lair
even
as
bees
cease
from
labour
when
a
gleam
of
sunshine
steals
into
the
hive
the
real
destiny
the
inner
destiny
would
in
any
event
have
followed
its
course
in
the
souls
of
claudius
and
gertrude
for
these
sinful
ones
had
delivered
themselves
into
its
hands
as
must
needs
be
the
case
with
those
whose
ways
are
evil
but
would
it
have
dared
to
spread
its
influence
abroad
if
one
of
those
sages
had
been
in
the
palace
would
it
have
dared
to
overstep
the
shining
denouncing
barrier
that
his
presence
would
have
imposed
and
maintained
in
front
of
the
palace
gates
when
the
sage
destiny
blends
with
that
of
men
of
inferior
wisdom
the
sage
raises
them
to
his
level
but
himself
will
rarely
descend
neither
on
earth
nor
in
the
domain
of
fatality
do
rivers
flow
back
to
their
source
but
to
return
let
us
imagine
a
sovereign
soul
that
of
jesus
in
hamlet
place
at
elsinore
would
the
tragedy
then
have
flown
on
till
it
reached
the
four
deaths
at
the
end
is
that
conceivable
a
crime
may
be
never
so
skilfully
planned
when
the
eyes
of
deep
wisdom
rest
on
it
it
becomes
like
a
trivial
show
that
we
offer
to
very
small
children
at
nightfall
some
performance
whose
tawdry
imposture
a
last
gleam
of
sunshine
lays
bare
can
you
conceive
jesus
christ
nay
any
wise
man
you
have
happened
to
meet
in
the
midst
of
the
unnatural
gloom
that
overhung
elsinore
is
not
every
action
of
hamlet
induced
by
a
fanatical
impulse
which
tells
him
that
duty
consists
in
revenge
alone
and
does
it
need
superhuman
effort
to
recognise
that
revenge
never
can
be
a
duty
i
say
again
that
hamlet
thinks
much
but
that
he
is
by
no
means
wise
he
can
not
conceive
where
to
look
for
the
weak
spot
in
armour
lofty
thoughts
suffice
not
always
to
overcome
destiny
for
against
these
destiny
can
oppose
thoughts
that
are
loftier
still
but
what
destiny
has
ever
withstood
thoughts
that
are
simple
and
good
thoughts
that
are
tender
and
loyal
we
can
triumph
over
destiny
only
by
doing
the
very
reverse
of
the
evil
she
fain
would
have
us
commit
for
no
tragedy
can
be
inevitable
at
elsinore
there
is
not
a
soul
but
refuses
to
see
and
hence
the
catastrophe
but
a
soul
that
is
quick
with
life
will
compel
those
around
it
to
open
their
eyes
where
was
it
written
that
laertes
ophelia
hamlet
claudius
gertrude
should
die
where
save
in
hamlet
pitiful
blindness
but
was
this
blindness
inevitable
why
speak
of
destiny
when
a
simple
thought
had
sufficed
to
arrest
all
the
forces
of
murder
the
empire
of
destiny
is
surely
sufficiently
vast
i
acknowledge
her
might
when
a
wall
crashes
down
on
my
head
when
the
storm
drives
a
ship
on
the
rocks
when
disease
attacks
those
whom
i
love
but
into
man
soul
she
never
will
come
uncalled
hamlet
is
unhappy
because
he
moves
in
unnatural
darkness
and
his
ignorance
puts
the
seal
upon
his
unhappiness
we
have
but
to
issue
commands
and
fate
will
obey
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
will
offer
such
long
and
patient
submission
horatio
up
to
the
last
could
have
issued
commands
but
his
master
shadow
lay
on
him
and
he
lacked
the
courage
to
shake
himself
free
had
there
been
but
one
soul
courageous
enough
to
cry
out
the
truth
then
had
the
history
of
elsinore
not
been
shrouded
in
tears
of
hatred
and
horror
but
misfortune
that
bends
beneath
the
fingers
of
wisdom
like
the
cane
that
we
cut
from
the
tree
becomes
iron
and
murderously
rigid
in
the
hand
of
unconsciousness
once
again
all
depended
here
not
on
destiny
but
on
the
wisdom
of
the
wisest
and
this
hamlet
was
therefore
did
he
by
his
presence
become
the
centre
of
the
drama
of
elsinore
and
on
himself
only
did
the
wisdom
of
hamlet
depend
and
if
you
look
distrustfully
on
imaginary
tragedies
you
have
only
to
investigate
some
of
the
greatest
dramas
of
authentic
history
to
find
that
in
these
too
the
destinies
of
men
are
no
different
that
their
ways
are
the
same
and
their
petulance
their
revolt
and
submission
you
will
discover
that
there
too
it
is
a
force
of
man
own
creating
that
plays
the
most
active
part
in
what
if
pleases
us
to
term
fatality
this
fatality
it
is
true
is
enormous
but
rarely
irresistible
it
does
not
leap
forth
at
a
given
moment
from
an
inexorable
inaccessible
unfathomable
abyss
it
is
build
up
of
the
energy
the
desires
and
suffering
the
thoughts
and
passions
of
our
brothers
and
these
passions
should
be
well
known
to
us
for
they
differ
not
from
our
own
in
our
most
inexplicable
moments
in
our
most
mysterious
unexpected
misfortunes
we
rarely
find
ourselves
struggling
with
an
invisible
enemy
or
one
that
is
entirely
foreign
to
us
why
strive
of
our
own
free
will
to
enlarge
the
domain
of
the
inevitable
they
who
are
truly
strong
are
aware
that
among
the
forces
that
oppose
their
schemes
there
are
some
that
they
know
not
but
against
such
as
they
do
know
they
fight
on
as
bravely
as
though
no
others
existed
and
these
men
will
be
often
victorious
we
shall
have
added
most
strangely
to
our
safety
and
happiness
and
peace
the
day
that
our
sloth
and
our
ignorance
shall
have
ceased
to
term
fatal
what
should
truly
be
looked
on
as
human
and
natural
by
our
intelligence
and
our
energy
let
us
consider
one
noteworthy
victim
of
destiny
louis
xvi
never
it
would
seem
did
relentless
fatality
clamour
so
loudly
for
the
destruction
of
an
unfortunate
man
of
one
who
was
gentle
and
good
and
virtuous
and
honourable
and
yet
as
we
look
more
closely
into
the
pages
of
history
do
we
not
find
that
fatality
distils
her
poison
from
the
victim
own
wavering
feebleness
his
own
trivial
duplicity
blindness
unreason
and
vanity
and
if
it
be
true
that
some
kind
of
predestination
governs
every
circumstance
of
life
it
appears
to
be
no
less
true
that
such
predestination
exists
in
our
character
only
and
to
modify
character
must
surely
be
easy
to
the
man
of
unfettered
will
for
is
it
not
constantly
changing
in
the
lives
of
the
vast
bulk
of
men
is
your
own
character
at
thirty
the
same
as
it
was
when
you
were
ten
years
younger
it
will
be
better
or
worse
in
the
measure
that
you
have
believed
that
disloyalty
wickedness
hatred
and
falsehood
have
triumphed
in
life
or
goodness
and
truth
and
love
and
you
will
have
thought
that
you
witnessed
the
triumph
of
hatred
or
love
of
truth
or
of
falsehood
in
exact
accord
with
the
lofty
or
baser
idea
as
to
the
happiness
and
aim
of
your
life
that
will
slowly
have
arisen
within
you
for
it
is
our
most
secret
desire
that
governs
and
dominates
all
if
your
eyes
look
for
nothing
but
evil
you
will
always
see
evil
triumphant
but
if
you
have
learned
to
let
your
glance
rest
on
sincerity
simpleness
truth
you
will
ever
discover
deep
down
in
all
things
the
silent
overpowering
victory
of
that
which
you
love
it
is
scarcely
from
this
point
of
view
however
that
louis
xvi
should
be
judged
let
us
rather
imagine
ourselves
in
his
place
in
the
midst
of
his
doubt
and
bewilderment
his
darkness
and
difficulties
now
that
we
know
all
that
happened
it
is
easy
enough
to
declare
what
should
have
been
done
but
are
we
ourselves
at
this
moment
aware
of
what
is
our
duty
are
we
not
contending
with
troubles
and
doubts
of
our
own
and
were
it
not
well
that
they
who
one
day
shall
pass
judgment
upon
us
should
seek
out
the
track
that
our
footsteps
have
left
on
the
sands
of
the
hillock
we
climbed
hoping
thence
to
discover
the
future
louis
xvi
was
bewildered
do
we
know
what
ought
to
be
done
do
we
know
what
we
best
had
abandon
what
we
best
had
defend
are
we
wiser
than
he
as
we
waver
betwixt
the
rights
of
human
reason
and
those
that
circumstance
claims
and
when
hesitation
is
conscientious
does
it
not
often
possess
all
the
elements
of
duty
there
is
one
most
important
lesson
to
be
learned
from
the
example
of
this
unfortunate
king
and
it
is
that
when
doubt
confronts
us
which
in
itself
is
noble
and
great
it
is
our
duty
to
march
bravely
onwards
turning
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
of
us
going
infinitely
further
than
seems
to
be
reasonable
practical
just
the
idea
that
we
hold
of
duty
and
justice
and
truth
may
seem
clear
to
us
now
and
advanced
and
unfettered
but
how
different
will
it
appear
a
few
years
a
few
centuries
later
had
louis
xvi
done
what
we
should
have
done
we
who
now
are
aware
of
what
had
been
the
right
thing
to
do
had
he
frankly
renounced
all
the
follies
of
royal
prerogative
and
loyally
adopted
the
new
truth
and
loftier
justice
that
had
sprung
into
being
then
should
we
be
admiring
his
genius
and
the
king
himself
perhaps
for
he
was
not
a
foolish
man
or
wicked
may
have
for
one
instant
beheld
his
own
situation
with
the
clear
eye
of
an
impartial
philosopher
that
at
least
is
by
no
means
impossible
historically
or
psychologically
even
in
our
most
solemn
hours
of
doubt
it
is
rare
that
we
know
not
where
we
should
look
for
the
fixed
point
of
duty
its
unalterable
summit
but
we
feel
that
there
stretches
a
distance
too
wide
to
be
travelled
between
the
actual
thing
to
be
done
and
this
that
glitters
afar
in
its
solitude
and
yet
it
is
proved
by
man
whole
history
by
the
life
of
each
one
of
us
that
it
is
on
the
loftiest
summit
that
right
has
always
its
dwelling
and
that
to
this
summit
we
too
at
the
end
must
climb
after
much
precious
time
has
been
lost
on
many
an
intermediate
eminence
and
what
is
a
sage
a
great
man
a
hero
if
not
one
who
has
dared
to
go
alone
and
ahead
of
the
others
to
the
deserted
that
lay
more
or
less
within
sight
of
all
men
we
do
not
imply
that
louis
xvi
should
necessarily
have
been
a
man
of
this
stamp
a
man
of
genius
although
to
have
genius
seems
almost
the
duty
of
him
who
sways
in
his
hands
the
destiny
of
vast
numbers
of
men
nor
do
we
claim
that
the
best
men
among
us
would
have
been
able
to
escape
his
errors
or
the
misfortunes
to
which
they
gave
rise
and
yet
there
is
one
thing
certain
that
of
all
these
misfortunes
none
had
origin
not
one
was
supernaturally
or
too
mysteriously
inevitable
they
came
not
from
another
world
they
were
launched
by
no
monstrous
god
capricious
and
incomprehensible
they
were
born
of
an
idea
of
justice
that
men
failed
to
grasp
an
idea
of
justice
that
suddenly
had
wakened
in
life
but
never
had
lain
asleep
in
the
reason
of
man
and
is
there
a
thing
in
this
world
can
be
more
reassuring
or
nearer
to
us
more
profoundly
human
than
an
idea
of
justice
louis
xvi
may
well
have
regretted
that
this
idea
that
shattered
his
peace
should
have
awakened
during
his
reign
but
this
was
the
only
reproach
he
could
level
at
fate
and
when
we
murmur
at
fate
ourselves
our
complaints
have
much
the
same
value
for
the
rest
it
is
legitimate
enough
to
suppose
that
there
needed
but
one
single
act
of
energy
absolute
loyalty
disinterested
wisdom
to
change
the
whole
course
of
events
if
the
flight
to
varennes
in
itself
an
act
of
duplicity
and
culpable
weakness
had
only
been
arranged
a
little
less
childishly
foolishly
as
any
man
would
have
arranged
it
who
was
accustomed
to
the
habits
of
life
there
can
be
not
a
doubt
that
louis
xvi
would
never
have
died
on
the
scaffold
was
it
a
god
or
his
blind
reliance
on
marie
antoinette
that
led
him
to
entrust
de
fersen
a
stupid
conceited
and
tactless
creature
with
the
preparations
and
control
of
this
disastrous
journey
was
it
a
force
instinct
with
great
mystery
or
only
his
own
unconsciousness
heedlessness
thoughtlessness
and
a
kind
of
strange
apathetic
submission
such
as
the
weak
and
the
idle
will
often
display
at
moments
of
danger
when
they
seem
almost
to
challenge
their
star
that
induced
him
again
and
again
at
each
change
of
horses
to
put
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
thus
be
recognised
three
or
four
times
and
at
the
moment
that
decided
all
in
that
throbbing
and
sinister
night
of
varennes
a
night
indeed
when
fatality
should
have
been
an
immovable
mountain
governing
all
the
horizon
do
we
not
see
this
fatality
stumbling
at
every
step
like
a
child
that
is
learning
to
walk
and
wonders
is
it
this
white
pebble
or
that
tuft
of
grass
that
will
cause
it
to
fall
to
right
or
to
left
of
the
path
and
then
at
the
tragic
halt
of
the
carriage
in
that
black
night
at
the
terrible
cry
sent
forth
by
young
drouet
in
the
name
of
the
nation
there
had
needed
but
one
order
from
the
king
one
lash
of
the
whip
one
pull
at
the
collar
and
you
and
i
would
probably
not
have
been
born
for
the
history
of
the
world
had
been
different
and
again
in
presence
of
the
mayor
who
stood
there
respectful
disconcerted
hesitating
ready
to
fling
every
gate
open
had
but
one
imperious
word
been
spoken
and
at
the
shop
of
sauce
the
worthy
village
grocer
and
last
of
all
when
goguelat
and
de
choiseul
had
arrived
with
their
hussars
bringing
rescue
salvation
did
not
all
depend
a
hundred
times
over
on
a
mere
yes
or
no
a
step
a
gesture
a
look
take
any
ten
men
with
whom
you
are
intimate
let
them
have
been
king
of
france
you
can
foretell
the
issue
of
their
ten
nights
ah
it
was
that
night
truly
that
heaped
shame
on
fatality
that
laid
bare
her
weakness
for
that
night
revealed
to
all
men
the
dependence
the
wretched
and
shivering
poverty
of
the
great
mysterious
force
that
in
moments
of
undue
resignation
seems
to
weigh
so
heavily
on
life
never
before
has
she
been
beheld
so
completely
despoiled
of
her
vestments
of
her
imposing
deceptive
robes
as
she
incessantly
came
and
went
that
night
from
death
to
life
from
life
to
death
throwing
herself
at
last
like
a
woman
distraught
into
the
arms
of
an
unhappy
king
whom
she
besought
til
dawn
for
a
decision
an
existence
that
she
herself
never
can
find
save
only
in
the
depths
of
the
will
and
the
intellect
of
man
and
yet
this
is
not
the
entire
truth
it
is
helpful
to
regard
events
in
this
fashion
thus
seeking
to
minimise
the
importance
of
fatality
looking
upon
it
as
some
vague
and
wandering
creature
that
we
have
to
shelter
and
guide
we
gain
the
more
courage
thereby
the
more
confidence
initiative
and
these
are
qualities
essential
to
the
doing
of
anything
useful
and
they
shall
stand
us
in
good
stead
too
when
our
own
hour
of
danger
draws
nigh
but
for
all
that
we
do
not
pretend
that
there
truly
is
no
other
force
that
all
things
can
be
governed
by
our
will
and
our
intellect
these
must
be
trained
to
act
like
the
soldiers
of
a
conquering
army
they
must
learn
to
thrive
at
the
cost
of
all
that
opposes
them
they
must
find
sustenance
even
in
the
unknown
that
towers
above
them
those
who
desire
to
emerge
from
the
ordinary
habits
of
life
from
the
straitened
happiness
of
mere
men
must
march
with
deliberate
conviction
along
the
path
that
is
known
to
them
yet
never
forget
the
unexplored
regions
through
which
this
path
winds
we
must
act
as
though
we
were
masters
as
though
all
things
were
bound
to
obey
us
and
yet
let
us
carefully
tend
in
our
soul
a
thought
whose
duty
it
shall
be
to
offer
noble
submission
to
the
mighty
forces
we
may
encounter
it
is
well
that
the
hand
should
believe
that
all
is
expected
foreseen
but
well
too
that
we
should
have
in
us
a
secret
idea
inviolable
incorruptible
that
will
always
remember
that
whatever
is
great
most
often
must
be
unforeseen
it
is
the
unforeseen
the
unknown
that
fulfil
what
we
never
should
dare
to
attempt
but
they
will
not
come
to
our
aid
if
they
find
not
deep
down
in
our
heart
an
altar
inscribed
to
their
worship
men
of
the
mightiest
will
men
like
napoleon
were
careful
in
their
most
extraordinary
deeds
to
leave
open
a
good
share
to
fate
those
within
whom
there
lives
not
a
generous
hope
will
keep
fate
closely
confined
as
they
would
a
sickly
child
but
others
invite
her
into
the
limitless
plains
man
has
not
yet
the
strength
to
explore
and
their
eyes
follow
her
every
movement
these
feverish
hours
of
history
resemble
a
storm
that
we
see
on
the
ocean
we
come
from
far
inland
we
rush
to
the
beach
in
keen
expectation
we
eye
the
enormous
waves
with
curious
eagerness
with
almost
childish
intensity
and
there
comes
one
along
that
is
three
times
as
high
and
as
fierce
as
the
rest
it
rushes
towards
us
like
some
monster
with
diaphanous
muscles
it
uncoils
itself
in
mad
haste
from
the
distant
horizon
as
though
it
were
bearer
of
some
urgent
complete
revelation
it
ploughs
in
its
wake
a
track
so
deep
that
we
feel
that
the
sea
must
at
last
be
yielding
up
one
of
her
secrets
but
all
things
happen
the
same
as
on
a
breathless
and
cloudless
day
when
languid
wavelets
roll
to
and
fro
in
the
limpid
fathomless
water
from
the
ocean
arises
no
living
thing
not
a
blade
of
grass
not
a
stone
if
aught
could
discourage
the
sage
though
he
is
not
truly
wise
whose
astonishment
is
not
enlightened
and
his
interest
quickened
by
the
unforeseen
thing
that
discourages
it
would
be
the
discovery
in
this
french
revolution
of
more
than
one
destiny
that
is
infinitely
sadder
more
overwhelming
more
inexplicable
than
that
of
louis
xvi
i
refer
to
the
girondins
above
all
to
the
admirable
vergniaud
even
though
we
know
all
that
the
future
kept
hidden
from
him
and
are
able
to
divine
what
it
was
that
was
sought
by
the
instinctive
desire
of
that
exceptional
century
even
it
were
surely
not
possible
to
act
more
nobly
more
wisely
than
he
let
fortune
hurl
any
man
into
the
burning
centre
of
a
movement
that
had
swept
every
barrier
down
it
were
surely
not
possible
to
reveal
a
finer
character
or
loftier
spirit
could
we
fashion
deep
down
in
our
heart
out
of
all
that
is
purest
within
us
out
of
all
our
wisdom
and
all
our
love
some
beautiful
spotless
creature
with
never
a
thought
of
self
without
weakness
or
error
such
a
being
would
desire
a
place
by
the
side
of
vergniaud
on
those
deserted
convention
seats
whereon
the
shadow
of
death
seemed
already
to
hover
that
he
might
think
as
vergniaud
thought
and
so
speak
and
act
he
saw
the
infallible
eternal
that
lay
the
other
side
of
that
tragical
moment
he
knew
how
to
be
humane
and
benevolent
still
through
all
those
terrible
days
when
humanity
and
benevolence
seemed
the
bitterest
enemies
of
the
ideal
of
justice
whereto
he
had
sacrificed
all
and
in
his
great
and
noble
doubt
he
marched
bravely
onwards
turning
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
of
him
going
infinitely
further
than
seemed
to
be
reasonable
practical
just
the
violent
death
that
was
not
unexpected
came
towards
him
with
half
his
road
yet
untravelled
to
teach
us
that
often
in
this
strange
conflict
between
man
and
his
destiny
the
question
is
not
how
to
save
the
life
of
our
body
but
that
of
our
most
beautiful
feelings
of
our
loftiest
thoughts
of
what
avail
are
my
loftiest
thoughts
if
i
have
ceased
to
exist
there
are
some
will
ask
to
whom
others
it
may
be
will
answer
what
becomes
of
myself
if
all
that
i
love
in
my
heart
and
my
spirit
must
die
that
my
life
may
be
saved
and
are
not
almost
all
the
morals
and
heroism
and
virtue
of
man
summed
up
in
that
single
choice
but
what
may
this
wisdom
be
that
we
rate
thus
highly
let
us
not
seek
to
define
it
too
closely
that
were
but
to
enchain
it
if
a
man
were
desirous
to
study
the
nature
of
light
and
began
by
extinguishing
all
the
lights
that
were
near
would
not
a
few
cinders
a
smouldering
wick
be
all
he
would
ever
discover
and
so
has
it
been
with
those
who
essayed
definition
the
word
wise
said
joubert
when
used
to
a
child
is
a
word
that
each
child
understands
and
that
we
need
never
explain
let
us
accept
it
even
as
the
child
accepts
it
that
it
may
grow
with
our
growth
let
us
say
of
wisdom
what
sister
hadewijck
the
mysterious
enemy
of
ruijsbroeck
the
admirable
said
of
love
its
profoundest
abyss
is
its
most
beautiful
form
wisdom
requires
no
form
her
beauty
must
vary
as
varies
the
beauty
of
flame
she
is
no
motionless
goddess
for
ever
couched
on
her
throne
she
is
minerva
who
follows
us
soars
to
the
skies
with
us
falls
to
the
earth
with
us
mingles
her
tears
with
our
tears
and
rejoices
when
we
rejoice
truly
wise
you
are
not
unless
your
wisdom
be
constantly
changing
from
your
childhood
on
to
your
death
the
more
the
word
means
to
you
the
more
beauty
and
depth
it
conveys
the
wiser
must
you
become
and
each
step
that
one
takes
towards
wisdom
reveals
to
the
soul
space
that
wisdom
never
shall
traverse
he
who
knows
himself
is
wise
yet
have
we
no
sooner
acquired
real
consciousness
of
our
being
than
we
learn
that
true
wisdom
is
a
thing
that
lies
far
deeper
than
consciousness
the
chief
gain
of
increased
consciousness
is
that
it
unveils
an
unconsciousness
on
whose
heights
do
the
sources
lie
of
the
purest
wisdom
the
heritage
of
unconsciousness
is
for
all
men
the
same
but
it
is
situate
partly
within
and
partly
without
the
confines
of
normal
consciousness
the
bulk
of
mankind
will
rarely
pass
over
the
border
but
true
lovers
of
wisdom
press
on
till
they
open
new
routes
that
cross
over
the
frontier
if
i
love
and
my
love
has
procured
me
the
fullest
consciousness
man
may
attain
then
will
an
unconsciousness
light
up
this
love
that
shall
be
quite
other
than
the
one
whereby
commonplace
love
is
obscured
for
this
second
unconsciousness
hedges
the
animal
round
whereas
the
first
draws
close
unto
god
but
needs
must
it
lose
all
trace
of
the
second
ere
it
become
aware
of
itself
in
unconsciousness
we
ever
must
dwell
but
are
able
to
purify
day
after
day
the
unconsciousness
that
wraps
us
around
we
shall
not
become
wise
through
worshipping
reason
alone
and
wisdom
means
more
than
perpetual
triumph
of
reason
over
inferior
instincts
such
triumphs
can
help
us
but
little
if
our
reason
be
not
taught
thereby
to
offer
profoundest
submission
to
another
and
different
instinct
that
of
the
soul
these
triumphs
are
precious
because
they
reveal
the
presence
of
diviner
instinct
that
grows
ever
diviner
still
and
their
aim
is
not
in
themselves
they
serve
but
to
clear
the
way
for
the
destiny
of
the
soul
which
is
a
destiny
always
of
purification
and
light
reason
flings
open
the
door
to
wisdom
but
the
most
living
wisdom
befinds
itself
not
in
reason
reason
bars
the
gate
to
malevolent
destiny
but
wisdom
away
on
the
horizon
throws
open
another
gate
to
propitious
destiny
reason
defends
and
withdraws
forbids
rejects
and
destroys
wisdom
advances
attacks
and
adds
increases
creates
and
commands
reason
produces
not
wisdom
which
is
rather
a
craving
of
soul
it
dwells
up
above
far
higher
than
reason
and
thus
is
it
of
the
nature
of
veritable
wisdom
to
do
countless
things
whereof
reason
disapproves
or
shall
but
approve
hereafter
so
was
it
that
wisdom
one
day
said
to
reason
it
were
well
to
love
one
enemies
and
return
good
for
evil
reason
that
day
tiptoe
on
the
loftiest
peak
in
its
kingdom
at
last
was
fain
to
agree
but
wisdom
is
not
yet
content
and
seeks
ever
further
alone
if
wisdom
obeyed
reason
only
and
sought
nothing
more
than
to
overcome
instinct
then
would
wisdom
be
ever
the
same
there
would
be
but
one
wisdom
for
all
and
its
whole
range
would
be
known
to
man
for
reason
has
more
than
once
explored
its
entire
domain
certain
fixed
points
there
well
may
be
that
are
common
to
all
classes
of
wisdom
but
there
exists
none
the
less
the
widest
possible
difference
between
the
atmospheres
that
enwrapped
the
wisdom
of
jesus
christ
and
of
socrates
of
aristides
and
marcus
aurelius
of
fenelon
and
jean
paul
let
the
same
event
befall
these
men
on
the
day
if
it
fall
into
the
running
waters
of
their
wisdom
it
will
undergo
complete
transformation
becoming
different
in
every
one
if
it
fall
into
the
stagnant
water
of
their
reason
it
will
remain
as
it
was
unchanged
if
jesus
christ
and
socrates
both
were
to
meet
the
adulterous
woman
the
words
that
their
reason
would
prompt
them
to
speak
would
vary
but
little
but
belonging
to
different
worlds
would
be
the
working
of
the
wisdom
within
them
far
beyond
words
and
far
beyond
thoughts
for
differences
such
as
these
are
of
the
very
essence
of
wisdom
there
is
but
one
for
the
wise
the
threshold
of
reason
but
they
separate
one
from
the
other
as
soon
as
the
triumphs
of
reason
are
well
understood
in
other
words
as
soon
as
they
enter
freely
the
domain
of
the
higher
unconsciousness
to
say
this
is
reasonable
is
by
no
means
the
same
as
to
say
this
is
wise
the
thing
that
is
reasonable
is
not
of
necessity
wise
and
a
thing
may
be
very
wise
and
yet
be
condemned
by
reason
it
is
from
reason
that
justice
springs
but
goodness
is
born
of
wisdom
and
goodness
we
are
told
by
plutarch
extends
much
further
than
justice
is
it
to
reason
or
wisdom
that
heroism
should
be
ascribed
wisdom
perhaps
is
only
the
sense
of
the
infinite
applied
to
our
moral
life
reason
it
is
true
has
the
sense
of
the
infinite
also
but
dare
not
do
more
than
accord
it
bare
recognition
it
would
seem
opposed
to
the
very
instinct
of
reason
to
regard
the
sense
of
the
infinite
as
being
of
importance
in
life
but
wisdom
is
wise
in
the
measure
that
the
infinite
governs
all
she
procures
to
be
done
in
reason
no
love
can
be
found
there
is
much
love
in
wisdom
and
all
that
is
highest
in
wisdom
entwines
around
all
that
is
purest
in
love
love
is
the
form
most
divine
of
the
infinite
and
also
because
most
divine
the
form
most
profoundly
human
why
should
we
not
say
that
wisdom
is
the
triumph
of
reason
divine
over
reason
of
man
we
can
not
cultivate
reason
too
fully
but
by
wisdom
only
should
reason
be
guided
the
man
is
not
wise
whose
reason
has
not
yet
been
taught
to
obey
the
first
signal
of
love
what
would
christ
all
the
heroes
have
done
had
their
reason
not
learned
to
submit
is
each
deed
of
the
hero
not
always
outside
the
boundary
of
reason
and
yet
who
would
venture
to
say
that
the
hero
is
not
wiser
by
far
than
the
sluggard
who
quits
not
his
chair
because
reason
forbids
him
to
rise
let
us
say
it
once
more
the
vase
wherein
we
should
tend
the
true
wisdom
is
love
and
not
reason
reason
is
found
it
is
true
at
the
of
wisdom
yet
is
wisdom
not
reason
flower
for
we
speak
not
of
logical
wisdom
here
but
of
wisdom
quite
other
the
favourite
sister
of
love
reason
and
love
battle
fiercely
at
first
in
the
soul
that
begins
to
expand
but
wisdom
is
born
of
the
peace
that
at
last
comes
to
pass
between
reason
and
love
and
the
peace
becomes
the
profounder
as
reason
yields
up
still
more
of
her
rights
to
love
wisdom
is
the
lamp
of
love
and
love
is
the
oil
of
the
lamp
love
sinking
deeper
grows
wiser
and
wisdom
that
springs
up
aloft
comes
ever
the
nearer
to
love
if
you
love
you
must
needs
become
wise
be
wise
and
you
surely
shall
love
nor
can
any
one
love
with
the
veritable
love
but
his
love
must
make
him
the
better
and
to
grow
better
is
but
to
grow
wiser
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
world
but
something
improves
in
his
soul
from
the
moment
he
loves
and
that
though
his
love
be
but
vulgar
and
those
in
whom
love
never
dies
must
needs
continue
to
love
as
their
soul
grows
nobler
and
nobler
love
is
the
food
of
wisdom
wisdom
the
food
of
love
a
circle
of
light
within
which
those
who
love
clasp
the
hands
of
those
who
are
wise
wisdom
and
love
are
one
and
in
swedenborg
paradise
the
wife
is
the
love
of
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
our
reason
said
fenelon
is
derived
from
the
clearness
of
our
ideas
but
our
wisdom
we
might
add
in
other
words
all
that
is
best
in
our
soul
and
our
character
is
to
be
found
above
all
in
those
ideas
that
are
not
yet
clear
were
we
to
allow
our
clear
ideas
only
to
govern
our
life
we
should
quickly
become
undeserving
of
either
much
love
or
esteem
for
truly
what
could
be
less
clear
than
the
reasons
that
bid
us
be
generous
upright
and
just
that
teach
us
to
cherish
in
all
things
the
noblest
of
feelings
and
thoughts
but
it
happily
so
comes
to
pass
that
the
more
clear
ideas
we
possess
the
more
do
we
learn
to
respect
those
that
as
yet
are
still
vague
we
must
strive
without
ceasing
to
clarify
as
many
ideas
as
we
can
that
we
may
thus
arouse
in
our
soul
more
and
more
that
now
are
obscure
the
clear
ideas
may
at
times
seem
to
govern
our
external
life
but
the
others
perforce
must
march
on
at
the
head
of
our
intimate
life
and
the
life
that
we
see
invariably
ends
by
obeying
the
invisible
life
on
the
quality
number
and
power
of
our
clear
ideas
do
the
quality
number
and
power
depend
of
those
that
are
vague
and
hidden
away
in
the
midst
of
these
vague
ones
patiently
biding
their
hour
there
may
well
lurk
most
of
the
definite
truths
that
we
seek
with
such
ardour
let
us
not
keep
them
waiting
too
long
and
indeed
a
beautiful
crystal
idea
we
awaken
within
us
shall
not
fail
in
its
turn
to
arouse
a
beautiful
vague
idea
which
last
growing
old
and
having
itself
become
clear
for
is
not
perfect
clearness
most
often
the
sign
of
decrepitude
in
the
idea
shall
also
go
forth
and
disturb
from
its
slumber
another
obscure
idea
but
loftier
lovelier
far
than
it
had
been
itself
in
its
sleep
and
thus
it
may
be
treading
gently
one
after
the
other
and
never
disheartened
in
the
midst
of
those
silent
ranks
some
day
by
mere
chance
a
small
hand
scarce
visible
yet
shall
touch
a
great
truth
clear
ideas
and
obscure
ideas
heart
intellect
will
and
reason
and
soul
truly
these
words
that
we
use
do
but
mean
more
or
less
the
same
thing
the
spiritual
riches
of
man
the
soul
may
well
be
no
more
than
the
most
beautiful
desire
of
our
brain
and
god
himself
be
only
the
most
beautiful
desire
of
our
soul
so
great
is
the
darkness
here
that
we
can
but
seek
to
divide
it
and
the
lines
that
we
trace
must
be
blacker
still
than
the
sections
they
traverse
of
all
the
ideals
that
are
left
to
us
there
is
perhaps
only
one
that
we
still
can
accept
and
that
one
is
to
gain
full
but
to
how
great
an
extent
does
this
knowledge
truly
depend
on
our
reason
this
knowledge
that
at
first
would
appear
to
depend
on
our
reason
alone
surely
he
who
at
last
had
succeeded
in
realising
to
the
fullest
extent
the
place
that
he
filled
in
the
universe
surely
he
should
be
better
than
others
be
wiser
and
truer
more
upright
in
a
word
be
more
moral
but
can
any
man
claim
in
good
faith
to
have
grasped
this
relation
and
do
not
the
roots
of
the
most
positive
morals
lie
hidden
beneath
some
kind
of
mystic
unconsciousness
our
most
beautiful
thought
does
no
more
than
pass
through
our
intelligence
and
none
would
imagine
that
the
harvest
must
have
been
reaped
in
the
road
because
it
is
seen
passing
by
when
reason
however
precise
sets
forth
to
explore
her
domain
every
step
that
she
takes
is
over
the
border
and
yet
is
it
the
intellect
that
lends
the
first
touches
of
beauty
to
thought
the
rest
lies
not
wholly
with
us
but
this
rest
will
not
stir
into
motion
until
intellect
touches
the
spring
reason
the
daughter
of
intellect
must
go
take
her
stand
on
the
threshold
of
our
spiritual
life
having
first
flung
open
the
gates
of
the
prison
beneath
where
the
living
instinctive
forces
of
being
lie
captive
asleep
she
must
wait
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
and
her
presence
alone
shall
suffice
to
ward
off
from
the
threshold
all
that
does
not
yet
conform
with
the
nature
of
light
beyond
in
the
regions
unlit
by
her
rays
obscure
life
continues
this
troubles
her
not
indeed
she
is
glad
she
knows
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
god
she
desires
all
that
has
not
yet
crossed
her
arcade
of
light
be
it
dream
be
it
thought
even
act
can
add
nothing
to
can
take
nothing
from
the
ideal
creature
she
is
craving
to
mould
she
watches
the
flame
of
her
lamp
needs
must
it
burn
brightly
and
remain
at
its
post
and
be
seen
from
afar
she
listens
untroubled
to
the
murmur
of
inferior
instincts
out
there
in
the
darkness
but
the
prisoners
slowly
awake
there
are
some
who
draw
nigh
to
the
threshold
and
their
radiance
is
greater
than
hers
there
flows
from
them
a
light
less
material
softer
and
purer
than
that
of
the
bold
hard
flame
which
her
hand
protects
they
are
the
inscrutable
powers
of
goodness
and
love
and
others
follow
behind
more
mysterious
still
and
more
infinite
seeking
admission
what
shall
she
do
if
at
the
time
that
she
took
her
stand
there
on
the
threshold
she
had
still
lacked
the
courage
to
learn
that
she
could
not
exist
alone
then
will
she
be
troubled
afraid
she
will
make
fast
the
gates
and
should
these
be
ever
reopened
she
would
find
only
quivering
cinders
at
the
foot
of
the
gloomy
stairs
but
if
her
strength
be
unshaken
if
from
all
that
she
could
not
learn
she
has
learned
at
least
that
in
light
there
can
never
be
danger
and
that
reason
itself
may
be
freely
staked
where
greater
brightness
prevails
then
shall
ineffable
changes
take
place
on
the
threshold
from
lamp
unto
lamp
drops
of
an
unknown
oil
will
blend
with
the
oil
of
the
wisdom
of
man
and
when
the
white
strangers
have
passed
the
flame
of
her
lamp
shall
rise
higher
transformed
for
all
time
shall
shed
purer
and
mightier
radiance
amidst
the
columns
of
the
loftier
doorway
so
much
for
isolated
wisdom
now
let
us
return
to
the
wisdom
that
moves
to
the
grave
in
the
midst
of
the
mighty
crowd
of
human
destinies
for
the
destiny
of
the
sage
holds
not
aloof
from
that
of
the
wicked
and
frivolous
all
destinies
are
for
ever
commingling
and
the
adventure
is
rare
in
whose
web
the
hempen
thread
blends
not
with
the
golden
there
are
misfortunes
more
gradual
less
frightful
of
aspect
than
those
that
befell
oedipus
and
the
prince
of
elsinore
misfortunes
that
quail
not
beneath
the
gaze
of
truth
or
justice
or
love
those
who
speak
of
the
profit
of
wisdom
are
never
so
wise
as
when
they
freely
admit
without
pride
or
that
wisdom
grants
scarcely
a
boon
to
her
faithful
that
the
foolish
or
wicked
would
prize
and
indeed
it
may
often
take
place
that
the
sage
as
he
moves
among
men
shall
pass
almost
unnoticed
shall
affect
them
but
slightly
be
this
that
his
stay
is
too
brief
that
he
comes
too
late
that
he
misses
true
contact
or
perchance
that
he
has
to
contend
with
forces
too
overwhelming
amassed
by
myriad
men
from
time
immemorial
no
miracles
can
he
perform
on
material
things
he
can
save
only
that
which
life
ordinary
laws
still
allow
to
be
saved
and
himself
it
may
be
shall
be
suddenly
seized
in
a
great
inexorable
whirlwind
but
though
he
perish
therein
still
does
he
escape
the
fate
that
is
common
to
most
for
at
least
he
will
die
without
having
been
forced
for
weeks
or
it
may
be
for
years
before
the
catastrophe
to
be
the
helpless
despairing
witness
of
the
ruin
of
his
soul
and
to
save
some
one
if
we
admit
that
in
life
there
are
truly
two
lives
does
not
of
necessity
mean
that
we
save
him
from
death
and
disaster
but
indeed
that
we
render
him
happier
inasmuch
as
we
try
to
improve
him
moral
salvation
is
the
greatest
salvation
and
yet
what
a
trifle
this
seems
as
everything
seems
that
is
done
on
the
loftiest
summits
of
soul
was
the
penitent
thief
not
saved
and
that
not
alone
in
the
christian
sense
of
the
word
but
in
its
fullest
most
perfect
meaning
still
had
he
to
die
and
at
that
very
hour
but
he
died
eternally
happy
because
at
the
very
last
moment
he
too
had
been
loved
and
a
being
of
infinite
wisdom
had
declared
that
his
soul
had
not
been
without
value
that
his
soul
too
had
been
good
and
had
not
passed
through
the
world
unperceived
of
all
men
as
we
go
deeper
down
into
life
we
discover
the
secret
of
more
and
more
sorrow
and
helplessness
we
see
that
many
souls
round
us
lead
idle
and
foolish
lives
because
they
believe
they
are
useless
unnoticed
by
all
unloved
and
convinced
they
have
nothing
within
them
that
is
worthy
of
love
but
to
the
sage
the
hour
must
come
when
every
soul
that
exists
claims
his
glance
his
approval
his
love
if
only
because
it
possesses
the
mysterious
gift
of
existence
the
hour
must
come
when
he
sees
that
falsehood
and
weakness
and
vice
are
but
on
the
surface
when
his
eye
shall
pierce
through
and
discover
the
strength
and
the
truth
and
the
virtue
that
lie
underneath
happy
and
blessed
hour
when
wickedness
stands
forth
revealed
as
goodness
bereft
of
its
guide
and
treachery
is
seen
to
be
loyalty
for
ever
astray
from
the
highway
of
happiness
and
hatred
becomes
only
love
in
poignant
despair
that
is
digging
its
grave
then
unsuspected
of
any
shall
it
be
with
all
those
who
are
near
the
good
man
as
it
was
with
the
penitent
thief
into
the
humblest
soul
that
will
thus
have
been
saved
by
a
look
or
a
word
or
a
silence
shall
the
true
happiness
fall
the
happiness
fate
can
not
touch
that
brings
to
all
men
the
oblivion
it
gave
unto
socrates
and
causes
each
one
to
forget
until
nightfall
that
the
death
giving
cup
had
been
drained
ere
the
sun
went
down
the
inner
life
perhaps
is
not
what
we
deem
it
to
be
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
inner
lives
as
there
are
of
external
lives
into
these
tranquil
regions
the
smallest
may
enter
as
readily
as
he
who
is
greatest
for
the
gate
that
leads
thither
is
not
always
the
gate
of
the
intellect
it
often
may
happen
that
the
man
of
vast
knowledge
shall
knock
at
this
gate
in
vain
reply
being
made
from
within
by
the
man
who
knows
nothing
the
inner
life
that
is
surest
most
lasting
possessed
of
the
uttermost
beauty
must
needs
be
the
one
that
consciousness
slowly
erects
in
itself
with
the
aid
of
all
that
is
purest
in
the
soul
and
he
is
wise
who
has
learned
that
this
life
should
be
nourished
on
every
event
of
the
day
he
to
whom
deceit
or
betrayal
serves
but
to
enhance
his
wisdom
he
in
whom
evil
itself
becomes
fuel
for
the
flame
of
love
he
is
wise
who
at
last
sees
in
suffering
only
the
light
that
it
sheds
on
his
soul
and
whose
eyes
never
rest
on
the
shadow
it
casts
upon
those
who
have
sent
it
towards
him
and
wiser
still
is
the
man
to
whom
sorrow
and
joy
not
only
bring
increase
of
consciousness
but
also
the
knowledge
that
something
exists
superior
to
consciousness
even
to
have
reached
this
point
is
to
reach
the
summit
of
inward
life
whence
at
last
we
look
down
on
the
flames
whose
light
has
helped
our
ascent
but
not
many
can
climb
so
high
and
happiness
may
be
achieved
in
the
less
ardent
valley
below
where
the
flames
spring
darkly
to
life
and
there
are
existences
still
more
obscure
which
yet
have
their
places
of
refuge
there
are
some
that
instinctively
fashion
inward
lives
for
themselves
there
are
some
that
bereft
of
initiative
or
of
intelligence
never
discover
the
path
that
leads
into
themselves
and
are
never
aware
of
all
that
their
refuge
contains
and
yet
will
their
actions
be
wholly
the
same
as
the
actions
of
those
whose
intellect
weighs
every
treasure
there
are
some
who
desire
only
good
though
they
know
not
wherefore
they
desire
it
and
have
no
suspicion
that
goodness
is
the
one
fixed
star
of
loftiest
consciousness
the
inner
life
begins
when
the
soul
becomes
good
and
not
when
the
intellect
ripens
it
is
somewhat
strange
that
this
inner
life
can
never
be
formed
out
of
evil
no
inner
life
is
for
him
whose
soul
is
bereft
of
all
nobleness
he
may
have
full
knowledge
of
self
he
may
know
it
may
be
wherefore
he
shuns
goodness
and
yet
shall
he
seek
in
vain
for
the
refuge
the
strength
the
treasure
of
invisible
gladness
that
form
the
possessions
of
him
who
can
fearlessly
enter
his
heart
for
the
inward
life
is
built
up
of
a
certain
rejoicing
of
soul
and
the
soul
can
never
be
happy
if
it
possess
not
and
love
not
something
that
is
pure
it
may
perhaps
err
in
its
choice
but
then
even
will
it
be
happier
than
the
soul
to
which
it
has
never
been
given
to
choose
and
thus
are
we
truly
saving
a
man
if
we
bring
about
that
he
loves
evil
somewhat
less
than
he
loved
it
before
for
we
are
helping
that
man
to
construct
deep
down
in
his
soul
the
refuge
where
against
destiny
shall
brandish
her
weapons
in
vain
this
refuge
is
the
monument
of
consciousness
or
it
may
be
of
love
for
love
is
nothing
but
consciousness
still
vaguely
in
search
of
itself
and
veritable
consciousness
nothing
but
love
that
at
last
has
emerged
from
the
shadow
and
it
is
in
the
deepest
recess
of
this
refuge
that
the
soul
shall
kindle
the
wondrous
fire
of
her
joy
and
this
joy
of
the
soul
is
like
unto
no
other
joy
and
even
as
material
fire
will
chase
away
deadly
disease
from
the
earth
so
will
the
joy
of
the
soul
scatter
sorrow
that
malevolent
destiny
brings
it
arises
not
from
exterior
happiness
it
arises
not
from
satisfied
for
the
joy
that
procures
becomes
less
as
the
soul
becomes
nobler
but
the
joy
of
pure
love
increases
as
nobility
comes
to
the
soul
nor
is
this
joy
born
of
pride
for
to
be
able
to
smile
at
its
beauty
is
not
enough
to
bring
joy
to
the
soul
the
soul
that
has
sought
in
itself
has
the
right
to
know
of
its
beauty
but
to
brood
on
this
beauty
too
much
to
become
thereof
were
perhaps
to
detract
somewhat
from
the
unconsciousness
of
its
love
the
joy
that
i
speak
of
takes
not
from
love
what
it
adds
unto
consciousness
for
in
this
joy
and
in
this
joy
alone
do
consciousness
and
love
become
one
feeding
each
on
the
other
each
gaining
from
that
which
it
gives
the
striving
intellect
may
well
know
happiness
beyond
the
reach
of
the
satisfied
body
but
the
soul
that
grows
nobler
has
joys
that
are
often
denied
to
the
striving
intellect
these
two
will
often
unite
and
labour
together
at
building
the
house
within
but
still
it
will
happen
at
times
that
both
work
apart
and
widely
different
then
are
the
structures
each
will
erect
and
were
this
to
be
so
and
the
being
i
loved
best
of
all
in
the
world
came
and
asked
me
which
he
should
choose
which
refuge
i
held
to
be
most
unattackable
sweetest
profoundest
i
would
surely
advise
him
to
shelter
his
destiny
in
the
refuge
of
the
soul
that
grows
nobler
is
the
sage
never
to
suffer
shall
no
storm
ever
break
on
the
roof
of
his
dwelling
no
traps
be
laid
to
ensnare
him
shall
wife
and
friends
never
fail
him
must
his
father
not
die
and
his
mother
his
brothers
his
sons
must
all
these
not
die
like
the
rest
shall
angels
stand
guard
at
each
highway
through
which
sorrow
can
pass
into
man
did
not
christ
himself
weep
as
he
stood
before
lazarus
tomb
had
not
marcus
aurelius
to
suffer
from
commodus
the
son
who
already
showed
signs
of
the
monster
he
was
to
become
from
faustina
the
wife
whom
he
loved
but
who
cared
not
for
him
was
not
destiny
hand
laid
heavy
on
paulus
aemilius
who
was
fully
as
wise
as
timoleon
did
not
both
his
sons
die
one
five
days
before
his
triumph
in
rome
and
the
other
but
three
days
after
what
becomes
of
the
refuge
then
where
wisdom
keeps
watch
over
happiness
must
we
take
back
all
we
have
said
and
is
wisdom
yet
one
more
illusion
by
whose
aid
the
soul
would
fain
conciliate
reason
and
justify
cravings
that
experience
is
sure
to
reject
as
being
opposed
to
reason
nay
in
truth
the
sage
too
must
suffer
he
suffers
and
suffering
forms
a
constituent
part
of
his
wisdom
he
will
suffer
perhaps
more
than
most
men
for
that
his
nature
is
far
more
complete
and
being
nearer
to
all
mankind
as
the
wise
ever
must
be
his
suffering
will
be
but
the
greater
for
the
sorrows
of
others
are
his
he
will
suffer
in
his
flesh
in
his
heart
in
his
spirit
for
there
are
sides
in
all
these
that
no
wisdom
on
earth
can
dispute
against
destiny
and
so
he
accepts
his
suffering
but
is
not
discouraged
thereby
not
for
him
are
the
chains
that
it
fastens
on
those
who
cringe
down
before
it
unaware
that
it
is
but
a
messenger
sent
by
a
mightier
personage
whom
a
bend
in
the
road
hides
from
view
needs
must
the
sage
like
his
neighbour
be
startled
from
sleep
by
the
shouts
of
the
truculent
envoy
by
the
blows
at
the
door
that
cause
the
whole
house
to
tremble
he
too
must
go
down
and
parley
but
yet
as
he
listens
his
eyes
are
not
fixed
on
this
bringer
of
evil
tidings
his
glance
will
at
times
be
lifted
over
the
messenger
shoulder
will
scan
the
dust
on
the
horizon
in
search
of
the
mighty
idea
that
perhaps
may
be
near
at
hand
and
indeed
when
our
thoughts
rest
on
fate
at
such
times
as
happiness
enfolds
us
we
feel
that
no
great
misfortune
can
be
suddenly
burst
upon
us
the
proportions
will
change
it
is
true
when
the
blow
falls
but
it
is
equally
true
that
before
the
misfortune
can
wholly
destroy
the
abiding
courage
within
us
it
first
must
triumph
in
our
heart
over
all
we
adore
over
all
we
admire
and
love
and
what
alien
power
can
expel
from
our
soul
a
feeling
and
thought
that
we
hurl
not
our
selves
from
its
throne
physical
suffering
apart
not
a
single
sorrow
exists
that
can
touch
us
except
through
our
thoughts
and
whence
do
our
thoughts
derive
the
weapons
wherewith
they
attack
or
defend
us
we
suffer
but
little
from
suffering
itself
but
from
the
manner
wherein
we
accept
it
overwhelming
sorrow
may
spring
his
unhappiness
was
caused
by
himself
said
a
thinker
of
one
whose
eyes
never
looked
over
the
brutal
shoulder
his
unhappiness
was
caused
by
himself
for
all
misery
is
inward
and
caused
by
ourselves
we
are
wrong
in
believing
that
it
comes
from
without
for
indeed
we
create
it
within
us
out
of
our
very
substance
it
is
only
in
the
manner
of
our
facing
the
event
that
its
active
force
consists
assemble
ten
men
who
like
paulus
aemilius
have
lost
both
their
sons
at
the
moment
when
life
seemed
sweetest
then
will
the
misfortune
appear
to
vary
in
every
one
misfortune
enters
within
us
but
must
of
necessity
yield
obedience
to
all
our
commands
even
as
the
order
may
be
that
it
finds
inscribed
on
the
threshold
so
will
it
sow
or
destroy
or
reap
if
my
neighbour
a
commonplace
man
were
to
lose
his
two
sons
at
the
moment
when
fate
had
granted
his
dearest
desires
then
would
darkness
steal
over
all
unrelieved
by
a
glimmer
of
light
and
misfortune
itself
contemptuous
of
its
too
facile
success
would
leave
naught
behind
but
a
handful
of
colourless
cinders
nor
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
see
my
neighbour
again
to
be
aware
that
his
sorrow
will
have
brought
to
him
pettiness
only
for
sorrow
does
merely
restore
to
us
that
which
our
soul
had
lent
in
happier
days
but
this
was
the
misfortune
that
befell
paulus
aemilius
rome
still
aglow
with
his
triumph
waited
dismayed
wondering
what
was
to
happen
were
the
gods
defying
the
sage
and
how
would
the
sage
reply
would
the
hero
be
crushed
by
his
sorrow
or
would
sorrow
acknowledge
its
master
mankind
at
moments
like
these
seems
aware
that
destiny
is
yet
once
again
making
trial
of
the
strength
of
her
arm
and
that
change
of
some
kind
must
befall
if
her
blow
crush
not
where
it
alights
and
see
with
what
eagerness
men
at
such
moments
will
question
the
eyes
of
their
chiefs
for
the
password
against
the
invisible
but
paulus
aemilius
has
gathered
together
an
assembly
of
the
people
of
rome
he
advances
gravely
towards
them
and
thus
does
he
speak
i
who
never
yet
feared
anything
that
was
human
have
amongst
such
as
were
divine
always
had
a
dread
of
fortune
as
faithless
and
inconstant
and
for
the
very
reason
that
in
this
war
she
had
been
as
a
favourable
gale
in
all
my
affairs
i
still
expected
some
change
and
reflux
of
things
in
one
day
i
passed
the
ionian
sea
and
reached
corcyra
from
brundisium
thence
in
five
more
i
sacrificed
at
delphi
and
in
other
five
days
came
to
my
forces
in
macedonia
where
after
i
had
finished
the
usual
sacrifices
for
the
purifying
of
the
army
i
entered
on
my
duties
and
in
the
space
of
fifteen
days
put
an
honourable
period
to
the
war
still
retaining
a
jealousy
of
fortune
even
from
the
smooth
current
of
my
affairs
and
seeing
myself
secure
and
free
from
the
danger
of
any
enemy
i
chiefly
dreaded
the
change
of
the
goddess
at
sea
whilst
conveying
home
my
victorious
army
vast
spoils
and
a
captive
king
nay
indeed
after
i
was
returned
to
you
safe
and
saw
the
city
full
of
joy
congratulating
and
sacrifices
yet
still
i
distrusted
well
knowing
that
fortune
never
conferred
any
great
benefits
that
were
unmixed
and
unattended
with
probabilities
of
reverse
nor
could
my
mind
that
was
still
as
it
were
in
labour
and
always
foreseeing
something
to
befall
this
city
free
itself
from
this
fear
until
this
great
misfortune
befell
me
in
my
own
family
and
till
in
the
midst
of
those
days
set
apart
for
triumph
i
carried
two
of
the
best
of
sons
my
only
destined
successors
one
after
another
to
their
funerals
now
therefore
i
am
myself
safe
from
danger
at
least
as
to
what
was
my
greatest
care
and
i
trust
and
am
verily
persuaded
that
for
the
time
to
come
fortune
will
prove
constant
and
harmless
unto
you
since
she
has
sufficiently
wreaked
her
jealousy
at
our
great
successes
on
me
and
mine
and
has
made
the
conqueror
as
marked
an
example
of
human
instability
as
the
captive
whom
he
led
in
triumph
with
this
only
difference
that
perseus
though
conquered
does
yet
enjoy
his
children
while
the
conqueror
aemilius
is
deprived
of
his
this
was
the
roman
fashion
of
accepting
the
greatest
sorrow
that
can
befall
a
man
at
the
moment
when
sorrow
is
felt
the
most
keenly
at
the
moment
of
his
greatest
happiness
and
there
are
many
ways
of
accepting
misfortune
as
many
indeed
as
there
are
generous
feelings
or
thoughts
to
be
found
on
the
earth
and
every
one
of
those
thoughts
every
one
of
those
feelings
has
a
magic
wand
that
transforms
on
the
threshold
the
features
and
vestments
of
sorrow
job
would
have
said
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
and
marcus
aurelius
perhaps
if
it
be
no
longer
allowed
me
to
love
those
i
loved
high
above
all
it
is
doubtless
that
i
may
learn
to
love
those
whom
i
love
not
yet
and
let
us
not
think
that
these
are
mere
empty
words
wherewith
they
console
themselves
words
that
in
vain
seek
to
hide
the
wound
that
bleeds
but
the
more
for
the
effort
but
if
it
were
so
if
empty
words
could
console
that
surely
were
better
than
to
be
bereft
of
all
consolation
and
further
if
we
have
to
admit
that
all
this
is
illusion
must
we
not
in
mere
justice
also
admit
that
illusion
is
the
solitary
thing
that
the
soul
can
possess
and
in
the
name
of
what
other
illusion
shall
we
venture
to
rate
this
illusion
so
lightly
ah
when
the
night
falls
and
the
great
sages
i
speak
of
go
back
to
their
lonely
dwelling
and
look
on
the
chairs
round
the
hearth
where
their
children
once
were
but
never
shall
be
again
then
truly
can
they
not
escape
some
part
of
the
sorrow
that
comes
overwhelming
to
those
whose
suffering
no
noble
thought
chastens
for
it
were
wrong
to
attribute
to
beautiful
feeling
and
thought
a
virtue
they
do
not
possess
there
are
external
tears
that
they
can
not
restrain
there
are
holy
hours
when
wisdom
can
not
yet
console
but
for
the
last
time
let
us
say
it
suffering
we
can
not
avoid
for
suffering
there
ever
must
be
still
does
it
rest
with
ourselves
to
choose
what
our
suffering
shall
bring
and
let
us
not
think
that
this
choice
which
the
eye
can
not
see
is
truly
a
very
small
matter
and
helpless
to
comfort
a
sorrow
whose
cause
the
eyes
never
cease
to
behold
out
of
small
matters
like
these
are
all
moral
joys
built
up
and
these
are
profounder
far
than
intellectual
or
physical
joys
translate
into
words
the
feeling
that
spurs
on
the
hero
and
how
trivial
it
seems
insignificant
too
does
the
idea
of
duty
appear
that
cato
the
younger
had
formed
when
compared
with
the
enormous
disturbance
it
caused
in
a
mighty
empire
or
the
terrible
death
it
brought
on
and
yet
was
not
cato
idea
far
greater
than
the
disturbance
or
death
that
ensued
do
we
not
feel
even
now
that
cato
was
right
and
was
not
his
life
rendered
truly
and
nobly
happy
thanks
to
this
very
idea
that
the
reason
of
man
will
not
even
consider
so
unreasonable
does
it
appear
all
that
ennobles
our
life
all
that
we
respect
in
ourselves
the
mainsprings
of
our
virtue
the
limits
that
feeling
will
even
impose
upon
vices
or
crimes
all
these
appear
veriest
trifles
when
viewed
by
the
cold
eye
of
reason
and
yet
do
they
fashion
the
laws
that
govern
every
man
life
would
life
be
endurable
if
we
did
not
obey
many
truths
that
our
reason
rejects
the
wretchedest
even
obeys
one
of
these
and
the
more
truths
there
are
that
he
yields
to
the
less
wretched
does
he
become
the
assassin
will
tell
you
i
murder
it
is
true
but
at
least
do
not
steal
and
he
who
has
stolen
steals
but
does
not
betray
and
he
who
betrays
would
at
least
not
betray
his
brother
and
thus
does
each
one
cling
for
refuge
to
his
last
fragment
of
spiritual
beauty
no
man
can
have
fallen
so
low
but
he
still
has
a
retreat
in
his
soul
where
he
ever
shall
find
a
few
drops
of
pure
water
and
be
girt
up
anew
with
the
strength
that
he
needs
to
go
on
with
his
life
for
here
again
reason
is
helpless
unable
to
comfort
she
must
halt
on
the
threshold
of
the

asylum
even
as
she
must
halt
on
the
threshold
of

resignation
of
the
love
of

of
the

bewildered
she

well
that

only
to

the

whereof
she
is

for
amidst
all
this

as

who
stands
with
the
sun
full
upon
him
his
shadow
is
there
at
his
feet
as
he
moves
it

possesses
of
the
dazzling
light
that
enfolds
him
and
so
has
reason
her
being
too
beneath
a
superior
light
and
the
shadow
can
not
affect
the
calm
unvarying
splendour
far
distant
as
marcus
aurelius
may
be
from
the
traitor
it
is
still
from
the
selfsame
well
that
they
both
draw
the
holy
water
that
freshens
their
soul
and
this
well
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
intellect
for
strangely
enough
it
is
not
in
our
reason
that
moral
life
has
its
being
and
he
who
would
let
reason
govern
his
life
would
be
the
most
wretched
of
men
there
is
not
a
virtue
a
beautiful
thought
or
a
generous
deed
but
has
most
of
its
roots
hidden
far
away
from
that
which
can
be
understood
or
explained
well
might
man
be
proud
could
he
trace
every
virtue
and
joy
and
his
whole
inward
life
to
the
one
thing
he
truly
possesses
the
one
thing
on
which
he
can
depend
in
a
word
to
his
reason
but
do
what
he
will
the
smallest
event
that
arrives
will
quickly
convince
him
that
reason
is
wholly
unable
to
offer
him
shelter
for
in
truth
we
are
beings
quite
other
than
merely
reasonable
creatures
but
if
it
be
not
our
reason
that
chooses
what
suffering
shall
bring
us
whereby
is
the
choice
then
made
by
the
life
we
have
lived
till
then
the
life
that
has
moulded
our
soul
wisdom
matures
but
slowly
her
fruits
shall
not
quickly
be
gathered
if
my
life
has
not
been
as
that
of
paulus
aemilius
there
shall
be
no
comfort
for
me
in
the
thoughts
whereby
he
was
consoled
not
though
every
sage
in
the
world
were
to
come
and
repeat
them
to
me
the
angels
that
dry
our
eyes
bear
the
form
and
the
features
of
all
we
have
said
and
thought
above
all
of
what
we
have
done
prior
to
the
hour
of
misfortune
when
thomas
carlyle
a
sage
although
somewhat
morbid
lost
the
wife
he
had
tenderly
loved
with
whom
he
had
lived
forty
years
then
did
his
sorrow
too
with
marvellous
exactness
become
as
had
been
the
bygone
life
of
his
love
and
therefore
was
this
sorrow
of
his
majestic
and
vast
consoling
and
torturing
alike
in
the
midst
of
his
his
regret
and
his
tenderness
as
might
be
meditation
or
prayer
on
the
shore
of
a
gloomy
sea
in
the
sorrow
that
floods
our
heart
we
have
as
it
were
a
synthetic
presentment
of
all
the
days
that
are
gone
and
as
these
were
so
shall
our
sorrow
be
poignant
or
tender
and
gentle
if
there
be
in
my
life
no
noble
or
generous
deeds
that
memory
can
bring
back
to
me
then
at
the
inevitable
moment
when
memory
melts
into
tears
must
these
tears
too
be
bereft
of
all
that
is
generous
or
noble
for
tears
in
themselves
have
no
colour
that
they
may
the
better
reflect
the
past
life
of
our
soul
and
this
reflection
becomes
our
chastisement
or
our
reward
there
is
but
one
thing
that
never
can
turn
into
suffering
and
that
is
the
good
we
have
done
when
we
lose
one
we
love
our
bitterest
tears
are
called
forth
by
the
memory
of
hours
when
we
loved
not
enough
if
we
always
had
smiled
on
the
one
who
is
gone
there
would
be
no
despair
in
our
grief
and
some
sweetness
would
cling
to
our
tears
reminiscent
of
virtues
and
happiness
for
our
recollections
of
veritable
love
which
indeed
is
the
act
of
virtue
containing
all
others
call
from
our
eyes
the
same
sweet
tender
tears
as
those
most
beautiful
hours
wherein
memory
was
born
sorrow
is
just
above
all
and
even
as
the
cast
stands
ready
awaiting
the
molten
bronze
so
is
our
whole
life
expectant
of
the
hour
of
sorrow
for
it
is
then
we
receive
our
wage
here
standing
close
to
the
mightiest
pillar
of
destiny
throne
we
may
see
once
again
how
restricted
her
power
becomes
on
such
as
surpass
her
in
wisdom
for
she
is
barbarian
still
and
many
men
tower
above
her
the
commonplace
life
still
supplies
her
with
weapons
which
today
are
and
crude
her
mode
of
attack
in
exterior
life
is
as
it
always
has
been
as
it
was
in
oedipus
days
she
shoots
like
a
aiming
straight
ahead
of
her
but
if
the
target
be
raised
somewhat
higher
than
usual
her
arrows
fall
harmless
to
earth
suffering
sorrow
tears
regrets
these
words
that
vary
so
slightly
in
meaning
are
names
that
we
give
to
emotions
which
in
no
two
men
are
alike
if
we
probe
to
the
heart
of
these
words
these
emotions
we
find
they
are
only
the
track
that
is
left
by
our
faults
and
there
where
these
faults
were
noble
for
there
are
noble
faults
as
there
are
mean
or
trivial
virtues
our
sorrow
will
be
nearer
akin
to
veritable
happiness
than
the
happiness
of
those
whose
consciousness
still
is
confined
within
narrowest
limits
would
carlyle
have
desired
to
exchange
the
magnificent
sorrow
that
flooded
his
soul
and
blossomed
so
tenderly
there
for
the
conjugal
joys
superficial
and
sunless
of
his
happiest
neighbour
in
chelsea
and
was
not
ernest
renan
grief
when
henriette
his
sister
died
more
grateful
to
the
soul
than
the
absence
of
grief
in
the
thousands
of
others
who
have
no
love
to
give
to
a
sister
shall
our
pity
go
forth
to
him
who
at
times
will
weep
on
the
shore
of
an
infinite
sea
or
to
the
other
who
smiles
all
his
life
without
cause
alone
in
his
little
room
happiness
sorrow
could
we
only
escape
from
ourselves
for
one
instant
and
taste
of
the
sadness
would
there
be
many
content
to
return
to
their
own
superficial
delights
do
happiness
and
sorrow
then
only
exist
in
ourselves
and
that
even
when
they
seem
to
come
from
without
all
that
surrounds
us
will
turn
to
angel
or
devil
according
as
our
heart
may
be
joan
of
arc
held
communion
with
saints
macbeth
with
witches
and
yet
were
the
voices
the
same
the
destiny
whereat
we
murmur
may
be
other
perhaps
than
we
think
she
has
only
the
weapons
we
give
her
she
is
neither
just
nor
unjust
nor
does
it
lie
in
her
province
to
deliver
sentence
on
man
she
whom
we
take
to
be
goddess
is
a
disguised
messenger
only
come
very
simply
to
warn
us
on
certain
days
of
our
life
that
the
hour
has
sounded
at
last
when
we
needs
must
judge
ourselves
men
of
inferior
degree
it
is
true
are
not
given
to
judging
themselves
and
therefore
is
it
that
fate
passes
judgment
upon
them
they
are
the
slaves
of
a
destiny
of
almost
unvarying
sternness
for
it
is
only
when
man
has
been
judged
by
himself
that
destiny
can
be
transformed
men
such
as
these
will
not
master
or
alter
within
them
the
event
that
they
meet
nay
they
themselves
become
morally
transformed
by
the
very
first
thing
that
draws
near
them
if
misfortune
befall
them
they
grovel
before
it
and
stoop
down
to
its
level
and
misfortune
with
them
would
seem
always
to
wear
its
poorest
and
commonest
aspect
they
see
the
finger
of
fate
in
every
least
thing
that
may
happen
be
it
choice
of
profession
a
friendship
that
greets
them
a
woman
who
passes
and
smiles
to
them
chance
and
destiny
always
are
one
but
chance
will
be
seldom
propitious
if
accepted
as
destiny
hostile
forces
at
once
take
possession
of
all
that
is
vacant
within
us
nor
filled
by
the
strength
of
our
soul
and
whatever
is
void
in
the
heart
or
the
mind
becomes
a
fountain
of
fatal
influence
the
margaret
of
goethe
and
ophelia
of
shakespeare
had
perforce
to
yield
meekly
to
fate
for
they
were
so
feeble
that
each
gesture
they
witnessed
seemed
fate
own
gesture
to
them
but
yet
had
they
only
possessed
some
fragment
of
antigone
strength
the
antigone
of
sophocles
would
they
not
then
have
transformed
the
destinies
of
hamlet
and
faust
as
well
as
their
own
and
if
othello
had
taken
corneille
pauline
to
wife
and
not
desdemona
would
desdemona
destiny
then
all
else
remaining
unchanged
have
dared
to
come
within
reach
of
the
enlightened
love
of
pauline
where
was
it
in
body
or
soul
that
grim
fatality
lurked
and
though
the
body
may
often
be
powerless
to
add
to
its
strength
can
this
ever
be
true
of
the
soul
indeed
the
more
that
we
think
of
it
the
clearer
does
it
become
that
there
could
be
one
destiny
only
that
might
truly
be
said
to
triumph
over
man
the
one
that
might
have
the
power
loudly
to
cry
unto
all
from
this
day
onward
there
shall
come
no
more
strength
to
thy
soul
neither
strength
nor
ennoblement
but
is
there
a
destiny
in
the
world
empowered
to
hold
such
language
and
yet
virtue
often
is
chastised
and
the
advent
of
misfortune
hastened
by
the
soul
very
strength
for
the
greater
our
love
may
be
the
greater
the
surface
becomes
we
expose
to
majestic
sorrow
wherefore
none
the
less
does
the
sage
never
cease
his
endeavours
to
enlarge
this
beautiful
surface
yes
it
must
be
admitted
destiny
is
not
always
content
to
crouch
in
the
darkness
her
hands
will
at
times
go
prowling
in
the
light
and
seize
on
more
beautiful
victims
the
tragic
name
of
antigone
has
already
escaped
me
and
there
will
doubtless
be
many
will
say
she
surely
fell
victim
to
destiny
all
her
great
force
notwithstanding
and
is
she
not
the
instance
we
long
have
been
seeking
in
vain
it
can
not
be
gainsaid
antigone
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
ruthless
goddess
for
the
reason
that
there
lay
in
her
soul
three
times
the
strength
of
any
ordinary
woman
she
died
for
fate
had
contrived
it
so
that
she
had
to
choose
between
death
and
what
seemed
to
her
a
sister
imperative
duty
she
suddenly
found
herself
wedged
between
death
and
love
love
of
the
purest
and
most
disinterested
kind
its
object
being
a
shade
she
would
never
behold
on
earth
and
if
destiny
thus
has
enabled
to
lure
her
into
the
murderous
angle
that
duty
and
death
had
formed
it
was
only
because
her
soul
that
was
loftier
far
than
the
soul
of
the
others
saw
stretching
before
it
the
insurmountable
barrier
of
duty
that
her
poor
sister
ismene
could
not
see
even
when
it
was
shown
her
and
at
that
moment
as
they
both
stood
there
on
the
threshold
of
the
palace
the
same
voices
spoke
to
them
antigone
listening
only
to
the
voice
from
above
wherefore
she
died
ismene
unconscious
of
any
save
that
which
came
from
below
and
she
lived
but
instil
into
antigone
soul
something
of
the
weakness
that
paralysed
ophelia
and
margaret
would
destiny
then
have
thought
it
of
service
to
beckon
to
death
as
the
daughter
of
oedipus
issued
from
the
doorway
of
creon
palace
it
was
therefore
solely
because
of
the
strength
of
her
soul
that
destiny
was
able
to
triumph
and
indeed
it
is
this
that
consoles
the
wise
and
the
just
the
heroes
destiny
can
vanquish
them
only
by
the
good
she
compels
them
to
do
other
men
are
like
cities
with
hundred
gates
that
she
finds
unguarded
and
open
but
the
upright
man
is
a
fortified
city
with
the
one
gate
only
of
light
and
this
gate
remains
closed
till
love
be
induced
to
knock
and
to
crave
admission
other
men
she
compels
to
obey
her
and
destiny
doing
her
will
wills
nothing
but
evil
but
would
she
subdue
the
upright
she
needs
must
desire
noble
acts
darkness
then
will
no
longer
enwrap
her
approach
the
upright
man
is
secure
in
the
light
that
enfolds
him
and
only
by
a
light
more
radiant
still
can
she
hope
to
prevail
destiny
then
will
become
more
beautiful
still
than
her
victim
ordinary
men
she
will
place
between
personal
sorrow
and
the
misfortune
of
others
but
to
master
the
hero
or
saint
she
must
cause
him
to
choose
between
the
happiness
of
others
and
the
grief
that
shall
fall
on
himself
ordinary
men
she
lays
siege
to
with
the
aid
of
all
that
is
ugly
against
the
others
she
perforce
must
enlist
whatever
is
noblest
on
earth
against
the
first
she
has
thousands
of
weapons
the
very
stones
in
the
road
becoming
engines
of
mischief
but
the
others
she
can
only
attack
with
one
irresistible
sword
the
gleaming
sword
of
duty
and
truth
in
antigone
story
is
found
the
whole
tale
of
destiny
empire
on
wisdom
jesus
who
died
for
us
curtius
who
leaped
into
the
gulf
socrates
who
refused
to
desist
from
his
teaching
the
sister
of
charity
who
yields
up
her
life
to
tending
the
sick
the
humble
wayfarer
who
perishes
seeking
to
rescue
his
fellows
from
death
all
these
have
been
forced
to
choose
all
these
bear
the
mark
of
antigone
glorious
wound
on
their
breast
for
truly
those
who
live
in
the
light
have
their
magnificent
perils
also
and
wisdom
has
danger
for
such
as
shrink
from
though
it
may
be
that
they
who
shrink
from
are
perhaps
not
very
wise
pronounce
the
word
destiny
and
in
the
minds
of
all
men
an
image
arises
of
gloom
and
of
terror
of
death
in
their
thoughts
they
regard
it
instinctively
as
the
lane
that
leads
straight
to
the
tomb
most
often
indeed
it
is
only
the
name
that
they
give
unto
death
when
its
hand
is
not
visible
yet
it
is
death
that
looms
in
the
future
the
shadow
of
death
upon
life
none
can
escape
his
destiny
we
often
exclaim
when
we
hear
of
death
lying
in
wait
for
the
traveller
at
the
bend
of
the
road
but
were
the
traveller
to
encounter
happiness
instead
we
would
never
ascribe
this
to
destiny
if
we
did
we
should
have
in
our
mind
a
far
different
goddess
and
yet
are
not
joys
to
be
met
with
on
the
highways
of
life
that
are
greater
than
any
misfortune
more
momentous
even
than
death
may
a
happiness
not
be
encountered
that
the
eye
can
not
see
and
is
it
not
of
the
nature
of
happiness
to
be
less
manifest
than
misfortune
to
become
ever
less
apparent
to
the
eye
as
it
reaches
loftier
heights
but
to
this
we
refuse
to
pay
heed
the
whole
village
the
town
will
flock
to
the
spot
where
some
wretched
adventure
takes
place
but
there
are
none
will
pause
for
an
instant
and
let
their
eyes
rest
on
a
kiss
or
a
vision
of
beauty
that
gladdens
the
soul
a
ray
of
love
that
illumines
the
heart
and
yet
may
the
kiss
be
productive
of
joy
no
less
great
than
the
pain
that
follows
a
wound
we
are
unjust
we
never
associate
destiny
with
happiness
and
if
we
do
not
regard
it
as
being
inseparable
from
death
it
is
only
to
connect
it
with
disaster
even
greater
than
death
itself
were
i
to
refer
to
the
destiny
of
oedipus
joan
of
arc
agamemnon
you
would
give
not
a
thought
to
their
lives
but
only
behold
the
last
moments
of
all
the
pathway
of
death
you
would
stoutly
maintain
that
their
destiny
was
of
the
saddest
for
that
their
end
was
sad
you
forget
however
that
death
can
never
be
happy
but
nevertheless
it
is
thus
we
are
given
to
judging
of
life
it
is
as
though
death
swallowed
all
and
should
accident
suddenly
end
thirty
years
lot
unclouded
joy
the
thirty
years
would
be
hidden
away
from
our
eyes
by
the
gloom
of
one
sorrowful
hour
it
is
wrong
to
think
of
destiny
only
in
connection
with
death
and
disaster
when
shall
we
cease
to
believe
that
death
and
not
life
is
important
that
misfortune
is
greater
than
happiness
why
when
we
try
to
sum
up
a
man
destiny
keep
our
eyes
fixed
only
on
the
tears
that
he
shed
and
never
on
the
smiles
of
his
joy
where
have
we
learned
that
death
fixes
the
value
of
life
and
not
life
that
of
death
we
deplore
the
destiny
of
socrates
duncart
antigone
and
many
others
whose
lives
were
noble
we
deplore
their
destiny
because
their
end
was
sudden
and
cruel
and
we
are
fain
to
admit
that
misfortune
prevails
over
wisdom
and
virtue
alike
but
first
of
all
you
yourself
are
neither
just
nor
wise
if
you
seek
in
wisdom
and
justice
aught
else
but
wisdom
and
justice
alone
and
further
what
right
have
we
thus
to
sum
up
an
entire
existence
in
the
one
hour
of
death
why
conclude
from
the
fact
that
socrates
and
antigone
met
with
unhappy
ends
that
it
was
their
wisdom
or
virtue
brought
unhappiness
to
them
does
death
occupy
more
space
in
life
than
birth
yet
do
you
not
take
the
sage
birth
into
account
as
you
ponder
over
his
destiny
happiness
or
unhappiness
arises
from
all
that
we
do
from
the
day
of
our
birth
to
the
day
of
our
death
and
it
is
not
in
death
but
indeed
in
the
days
and
the
years
that
precede
it
that
we
can
discover
a
man
true
happiness
or
sorrow
in
a
word
his
destiny
we
seem
to
imagine
that
the
sage
whose
terrible
death
is
written
in
history
spent
all
his
life
in
sad
anticipation
of
the
end
his
wisdom
prepared
whereas
in
reality
the
thought
of
death
troubles
the
wise
far
less
than
it
troubles
the
wicked
socrates
had
far
less
cause
than
macbeth
to
dread
an
unhappy
end
and
unhappy
as
his
death
may
have
been
it
at
least
had
not
darkened
his
life
he
had
not
spent
all
his
days
in
dying
preliminary
deaths
as
did
the
thane
of
cawdor
but
it
is
difficult
for
us
not
to
believe
that
a
wound
that
bleeds
a
few
hours
must
crumble
away
into
nothingness
all
the
peace
of
a
lifetime
i
do
not
pretend
that
destiny
is
just
that
it
rewards
the
good
and
punishes
the
wicked
what
soul
that
were
sure
of
reward
could
ever
claim
to
be
good
but
we
are
less
just
than
destiny
even
when
it
is
destiny
that
we
judge
our
eyes
see
only
the
sage
misfortune
for
misfortune
is
known
to
us
all
but
we
see
not
his
happiness
for
to
understand
the
happiness
of
the
wise
and
the
just
whose
destinies
we
endeavour
to
gauge
we
must
needs
be
possessed
of
wisdom
and
justice
that
shall
be
fully
equal
to
theirs
when
a
man
of
inferior
soul
endeavours
to
estimate
a
great
sage
happiness
this
happiness
flows
through
his
fingers
like
water
yet
is
it
heavy
as
gold
and
as
brilliant
as
gold
in
the
hand
of
a
brother
sage
for
to
each
is
the
happiness
given
that
he
can
best
understand
the
sage
misfortune
may
often
resemble
the
one
that
befalls
other
men
but
his
happiness
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
which
he
who
is
not
wise
terms
happiness
in
happiness
there
are
far
more
regions
unknown
than
there
are
in
misfortune
the
voice
of
misfortune
is
ever
the
same
happiness
becomes
the
more
silent
as
it
penetrates
deeper
when
we
put
our
misfortunes
into
one
scale
of
the
balance
each
of
us
lays
in
the
other
all
that
he
deems
to
be
happiness
the
savage
flings
feathers
and
powder
and
alcohol
into
the
scale
civilised
men
some
gold
a
few
days
of
delirium
but
the
sage
will
deposit
therein
countless
things
our
eyes
can
not
see
all
his
soul
it
may
be
and
even
the
misfortune
that
he
will
have
purified
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
more
just
than
happiness
nothing
that
will
more
faithfully
adopt
the
form
of
our
soul
or
so
carefully
fill
the
space
that
our
wisdom
clings
open
yet
is
it
most
silent
of
all
that
there
is
in
the
world
the
angel
of
sorrow
can
speak
every
language
there
is
not
a
word
but
she
knows
but
the
lips
of
the
angel
of
happiness
are
sealed
save
when
she
tells
of
the
savage
joys
it
is
hundreds
of
centuries
past
that
misfortune
was
cradled
but
happiness
seems
even
now
to
have
scarcely
emerged
from
its
infancy
there
are
some
men
have
learned
to
be
happy
why
are
there
none
whose
great
gladness
has
urged
them
to
lift
up
their
voice
in
the
name
of
the
silent
archangel
who
has
flooded
their
soul
with
light
are
we
not
almost
teaching
happiness
if
we
do
only
speak
of
it
invoking
it
if
we
let
no
day
pass
without
pronouncing
its
name
and
is
it
not
the
first
duty
of
those
who
are
happy
to
tell
of
their
gladness
to
others
all
men
can
learn
to
be
happy
and
the
teaching
of
it
is
easy
if
you
live
among
those
who
daily
call
blessing
on
life
it
shall
not
be
long
ere
you
will
call
blessing
on
yours
smiles
are
as
catching
as
tears
and
periods
men
have
termed
happy
were
periods
when
there
existed
some
who
knew
of
their
happiness
happiness
rarely
is
absent
it
is
we
that
know
not
of
its
presence
the
greatest
felicity
avails
us
nothing
if
we
know
not
that
we
are
happy
there
is
more
joy
in
the
smallest
delight
whereof
we
are
conscious
than
in
the
approach
of
the
mightiest
happiness
that
enters
not
into
our
soul
there
are
only
too
many
who
think
that
what
they
have
can
not
be
happiness
and
therefore
is
it
the
duty
of
such
as
are
happy
to
prove
to
the
others
that
they
only
possess
what
each
man
possesses
deep
down
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
to
be
happy
is
only
to
have
freed
one
soul
from
the
unrest
of
happiness
it
were
well
if
from
time
to
time
there
should
come
to
us
one
to
whom
fortune
had
granted
a
dazzling
superhuman
felicity
that
all
men
regarded
with
envy
and
if
he
were
very
simply
to
say
to
us
all
is
mine
that
you
pray
for
each
day
i
have
riches
and
youth
and
health
i
have
glory
and
power
and
love
and
if
i
am
truly
able
to
call
myself
happy
it
is
not
on
account
of
the
gifts
that
fortune
has
deigned
to
accord
me
but
because
i
have
learned
from
these
gifts
to
fix
my
eyes
far
above
happiness
if
my
marvellous
travels
and
victories
my
strength
and
my
love
have
brought
me
the
peace
and
the
gladness
i
sought
it
is
only
because
they
have
taught
me
that
it
is
not
in
them
that
the
veritable
gladness
and
peace
can
be
found
it
was
in
myself
they
existed
before
all
these
triumphs
and
still
in
myself
are
they
now
after
all
my
achievement
and
i
know
full
well
that
had
but
a
little
more
wisdom
been
mine
i
might
have
enjoyed
all
i
now
enjoy
without
the
aid
of
so
much
good
fortune
i
know
that
today
i
am
happier
still
than
i
was
yesterday
because
i
have
learned
at
last
that
i
stand
in
no
need
of
good
fortune
in
order
to
free
my
soul
to
bring
peace
to
my
thoughts
to
enlighten
my
heart
of
this
the
sage
is
fully
aware
though
no
superhuman
happiness
may
have
descended
upon
him
the
upright
man
knows
it
too
though
he
be
less
wise
than
the
sage
and
his
consciousness
less
fully
developed
for
an
act
of
goodness
or
justice
brings
with
it
a
kind
of
inarticulate
consciousness
that
often
becomes
more
effective
more
faithful
more
loving
than
the
consciousness
that
springs
into
being
from
the
very
deepest
thought
acts
of
this
nature
bring
above
all
a
special
knowledge
of
happiness
strive
as
we
may
our
loftiest
thoughts
are
always
uncertain
unstable
but
the
light
of
a
goodly
deed
shines
steadily
on
and
is
lasting
there
are
times
when
deep
thought
is
no
more
than
merely
fictitious
consciousness
but
an
act
of
charity
the
heroic
duty
fulfilled
these
are
true
consciousness
in
other
words
happiness
in
action
the
happiness
of
marcus
aurelius
who
condones
a
mortal
affront
of
washington
giving
up
power
when
he
feared
that
his
glory
was
leading
his
people
astray
the
happiness
of
these
will
differ
by
far
from
that
of
some
venomous
creature
who
might
if
such
a
thing
may
be
assumed
by
mere
chance
have
discovered
some
extraordinary
natural
law
long
is
the
road
that
leads
from
the
satisfied
brain
to
the
heart
at
rest
and
only
such
joys
will
nourish
there
as
are
proof
against
winter
storms
happiness
is
a
plant
that
thrives
far
more
readily
in
moral
than
in
intellectual
life
consciousness
the
consciousness
of
happiness
above
all
will
not
choose
the
intellect
as
a
for
the
treasure
it
holds
most
dear
at
times
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
all
that
is
loftiest
in
intellect
fraught
with
most
comfort
is
transformed
into
consciousness
only
when
passed
through
an
act
of
virtue
it
suffices
not
to
discover
new
truths
in
the
world
of
thought
or
of
fact
for
ourselves
a
truth
only
lives
from
the
moment
it
modifies
purifies
sweetens
something
we
have
in
our
soul
to
be
conscious
of
moral
improvement
is
of
the
essence
of
consciousness
some
beings
there
are
of
vigorous
intellect
whose
intellect
never
is
used
to
discover
a
fault
or
foster
a
feeling
of
charity
and
this
happens
often
with
women
in
cases
where
a
man
and
a
woman
have
equal
intellectual
power
the
woman
will
always
devote
far
less
of
this
power
to
acquiring
moral
and
truly
the
intellect
that
aims
not
at
consciousness
is
but
beating
its
wings
in
the
void
loss
and
corruption
needs
must
ensue
if
the
force
of
our
brain
be
not
at
once
gathered
up
in
the
purest
vase
of
our
heart
nor
can
such
an
intellect
ever
know
happiness
nay
it
seems
to
invite
misfortune
for
intellect
may
be
of
the
loftiest
mightiest
and
yet
perhaps
never
draw
near
unto
joy
but
in
the
soul
that
is
gentle
and
pure
and
good
sorrow
can
not
for
ever
abide
and
even
though
the
boundary
line
between
intellect
and
consciousness
be
not
always
as
clearly
defined
as
here
we
seem
to
assume
even
though
a
beautiful
thought
in
itself
may
be
often
a
goodly
action
yet
none
the
less
will
a
beautiful
thought
that
springs
not
from
noble
deed
or
wherefrom
noble
deed
shall
not
spring
add
but
little
unto
our
felicity
whereas
a
good
deed
though
it
father
no
thought
will
ever
fall
like
soft
bountiful
rain
on
our
knowledge
of
happiness
how
final
must
his
farewell
to
happiness
have
been
exclaims
renan
speaking
of
the
renouncement
of
marcus
aurelius
how
final
must
his
farewell
to
happiness
have
been
for
him
to
be
capable
of
such
excess
none
will
ever
know
how
great
was
the
suffering
of
that
poor
stricken
heart
or
the
bitterness
the
waxen
brow
concealed
calm
always
and
even
smiling
it
is
true
that
the
farewell
to
happiness
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and
the
surest
road
to
happiness
there
is
nothing
sweeter
than
the
return
of
joy
that
follows
the
renouncement
of
joy
as
there
is
nothing
more
exquisite
of
keener
deeper
delight
than
the
enchantment
of
the
disenchanted
in
these
terms
does
a
sage
describe
a
sage
happiness
but
is
it
true
that
the
happiness
of
marcus
aurelius
as
of
renan
himself
arose
only
from
the
return
of
joy
that
followed
the
renouncement
of
joy
and
from
the
enchantment
of
the
disenchanted
for
then
were
it
better
that
wisdom
be
less
that
we
be
the
less
disenchanted
but
what
can
the
wisdom
desire
that
declares
itself
thus
disenchanted
was
it
not
truth
that
it
sought
and
is
there
a
truth
that
can
stifle
the
love
of
truth
in
the
depths
of
a
loyal
heart
the
truth
that
has
taught
you
that
man
is
wicked
and
nature
unjust
that
justice
is
futile
and
love
without
power
has
indeed
taught
you
nothing
if
it
have
not
at
the
same
time
revealed
a
truth
that
is
greater
still
one
that
throws
on
these
disillusions
a
light
more
brilliant
more
ample
than
the
myriad
flickering
beams
it
has
quenched
all
around
you
for
there
lurks
unspeakable
pride
and
pride
of
the
poorest
kind
in
thus
declaring
ourselves
satisfied
because
we
can
find
satisfaction
in
nothing
that
is
such
satisfaction
in
truth
is
discontent
only
too
sluggish
to
lift
its
head
and
they
only
are
discontented
who
no
longer
would
understand
does
not
the
man
who
conceives
it
his
duty
to
forswear
all
happiness
renounce
something
as
well
that
as
yet
has
not
turned
into
happiness
and
besides
what
are
the
joys
to
which
we
bid
this
somewhat
affected
farewell
it
must
surely
be
right
to
discard
all
happiness
injurious
to
others
but
happiness
that
injures
others
will
not
long
wear
the
semblance
of
happiness
in
the
eyes
of
the
sage
and
when
his
wisdom
at
length
has
revealed
the
profounder
joys
will
it
not
be
in
all
unconsciousness
that
he
renounces
those
of
lesser
worth
let
us
never
put
faith
in
the
wisdom
or
gladness
that
is
based
on
contempt
of
a
single
existing
thing
for
contempt
and
renouncement
its
sickly
offspring
offer
asylum
to
none
but
the
weak
and
the
aged
we
have
only
the
right
to
scorn
a
joy
when
such
scorn
is
wholly
unconscious
but
so
long
as
we
listen
to
the
voice
of
contempt
or
renouncement
so
long
as
we
suffer
these
to
flood
our
heart
with
bitterness
so
long
must
the
joy
we
discard
be
a
joy
that
we
still
desire
we
must
beware
lest
there
enter
our
soul
certain
parasitic
virtues
and
renouncement
often
is
only
a
parasite
even
if
it
do
not
enfeeble
our
inward
life
it
must
inevitably
bring
disquiet
just
as
bees
cease
from
work
at
the
approach
of
an
intruder
into
their
hive
so
will
the
virtues
and
strength
of
the
soul
into
which
contempt
or
renouncement
has
entered
forsake
all
their
tasks
and
eagerly
flock
round
the
curious
guest
that
has
come
in
the
wake
of
pride
for
so
long
as
renouncement
be
conscious
so
long
will
the
happiness
found
therein
have
its
origin
truly
in
pride
and
he
who
is
bent
on
renouncement
had
best
first
of
all
forswear
the
delights
of
pride
for
these
are
wholly
vain
and
wholly
deceptive
within
reach
of
all
demanding
neither
boldness
nor
energy
is
this
enchantment
of
the
disenchanted
but
what
name
shall
we
give
to
the
man
who
renounces
that
which
brought
happiness
to
him
and
rather
would
surely
lose
it
than
live
in
fear
lest
fortune
haply
deprive
him
thereof
on
the
morrow
is
the
mission
of
wisdom
only
to
peer
into
the
uncertain
future
with
ear
on
the
stretch
for
the
footfall
of
sorrow
that
never
may
come
but
deaf
to
the
whirr
of
the
wings
of
the
happiness
that
fills
all
space
let
us
not
look
to
renouncement
for
happiness
till
we
have
sought
it
elsewhere
in
vain
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
if
we
be
content
to
regard
as
happiness
the
void
that
is
left
by
the
absence
of
happiness
but
it
was
not
for
unhappiness
the
sage
was
created
and
it
is
more
glorious
as
well
as
more
human
to
be
happy
and
still
to
be
wise
the
supreme
endeavour
of
wisdom
is
only
to
seek
in
life
for
the
fixed
point
of
happiness
but
to
seek
this
fixed
point
in
renouncement
and
farewell
to
joy
is
only
to
seek
it
in
death
he
who
moves
not
a
limb
is
persuaded
perhaps
he
is
wise
but
was
this
the
purpose
wherefor
mankind
was
created
ours
is
the
choice
whether
wisdom
shall
be
the
honoured
wife
of
our
passions
and
feelings
our
thoughts
and
desires
or
the
melancholy
bride
of
death
let
the
tomb
have
its
stagnant
wisdom
but
let
there
be
wisdom
also
for
the
hearth
where
the
fire
still
burns
it
is
not
by
renouncing
the
joys
that
are
near
us
that
we
shall
grow
wise
but
as
we
grow
wise
we
unconsciously
abandon
the
joys
that
now
are
beneath
us
even
so
does
the
child
as
years
come
to
him
give
up
one
by
one
without
thinking
the
games
that
have
ceased
to
amuse
and
just
as
the
child
learns
far
more
from
his
play
than
from
work
that
is
given
him
so
does
wisdom
progress
far
more
quickly
in
happiness
than
in
misfortune
it
is
only
one
side
of
morality
that
unhappiness
throws
into
light
and
the
man
whom
sorrow
has
taught
to
be
wise
is
like
one
who
has
loved
and
never
been
loved
in
return
there
must
always
be
something
unknown
to
the
love
whereto
no
other
love
has
made
answer
and
this
too
will
remain
unknown
to
him
whose
wisdom
is
born
of
sorrow
is
happiness
truly
as
happy
as
people
imagine
was
asked
of
two
happy
ones
once
by
a
philosopher
whom
protracted
injustice
had
saddened
no
it
is
a
thing
more
desirable
far
but
also
much
less
to
be
envied
than
people
suppose
for
it
is
in
itself
quite
other
than
they
can
conceive
who
have
never
been
perfectly
happy
to
be
gay
is
not
to
be
happy
nor
will
he
who
is
happy
always
be
gay
it
is
only
the
little
ephemeral
pleasures
that
forever
are
smiling
and
they
die
away
as
they
smile
but
some
loftiness
once
obtained
lasting
happiness
becomes
no
less
grave
than
majestic
sorrow
wise
men
have
said
it
were
best
for
us
not
to
be
happy
so
that
happiness
thus
might
be
always
the
one
thing
desired
but
how
shall
the
sage
to
whom
happiness
never
has
come
be
aware
that
wisdom
is
the
one
thing
alone
that
happiness
neither
can
sadden
nor
weary
those
thinkers
have
learned
to
love
wisdom
with
a
far
more
intimate
love
whose
lives
have
been
happy
than
those
whose
lives
have
been
sad
the
wisdom
forced
into
growth
by
misfortune
is
different
far
from
the
wisdom
that
ripens
beneath
happiness
the
first
where
it
seeks
to
console
must
whisper
of
happiness
the
other
tells
of
itself
he
who
is
sad
is
taught
by
his
wisdom
that
happiness
yet
may
be
his
he
who
is
happy
is
taught
by
his
wisdom
that
he
may
become
wiser
still
the
discovery
of
happiness
may
well
be
the
great
aim
of
wisdom
and
we
needs
must
be
happy
ourselves
before
we
can
know
that
wisdom
itself
contains
all
there
are
some
who
are
wholly
unable
to
support
the
burden
of
joy
there
is
a
courage
of
happiness
as
well
as
a
courage
of
sorrow
it
may
even
be
true
that
permanent
happiness
calls
for
more
strength
in
man
than
permanent
sorrow
for
the
heart
wherein
wisdom
is
not
delights
more
in
the
expectation
of
that
which
it
has
not
yet
than
in
the
full
possession
of
all
it
has
ever
desired
he
in
whom
happiness
dwells
is
amazed
at
the
heart
that
finds
aliment
only
in
fear
or
in
hope
and
that
can
not
be
nourished
on
what
it
possesses
though
it
possess
all
it
ever
desired
we
often
see
men
who
are
strong
and
morally
prudent
whom
happiness
yet
overcomes
not
finding
therein
all
they
sought
they
do
not
defend
it
or
cling
to
it
with
the
energy
needful
in
life
we
must
have
already
acquired
some
not
inconsiderable
wisdom
to
be
undismayed
at
perceiving
that
happiness
too
has
its
sorrow
and
to
be
not
induced
by
this
sorrow
to
think
that
ours
can
not
be
the
veritable
happiness
the
most
precious
gift
that
happiness
brings
is
the
knowledge
that
springs
up
within
us
that
it
is
not
a
thing
of
mere
ecstasy
but
a
thing
that
bids
us
reflect
it
becomes
far
less
rare
far
less
inaccessible
from
the
moment
we
know
that
its
greatest
achievement
is
to
give
to
the
soul
that
is
able
to
prize
it
an
increase
of
consciousness
which
the
soul
could
elsewhere
never
have
found
to
know
what
happiness
means
is
of
far
more
importance
to
the
soul
of
man
than
to
enjoy
it
to
be
able
long
to
love
happiness
great
wisdom
needs
must
be
ours
but
a
wisdom
still
greater
for
us
to
perceive
as
we
lie
in
the
bosom
of
cloudless
joy
that
the
fixed
and
stable
part
of
that
joy
is
found
in
the
force
which
deep
down
in
our
consciousness
could
render
us
happy
still
though
misfortune
wrapped
us
around
do
not
believe
you
are
happy
till
you
have
been
led
by
your
happiness
up
to
the
heights
whence
itself
disappears
from
your
gaze
but
leaving
you
still
unimpaired
the
desire
to
live
there
are
some
profound
thinkers
such
as
pascal
schopenhauer
hello
who
seem
not
to
have
been
happy
for
all
that
the
sense
of
the
infinite
universal
eternal
was
loftily
throned
in
their
soul
but
it
may
well
be
an
error
to
think
that
he
who
gives
voice
to
the
multitude
sorrow
must
himself
always
be
victim
to
great
personal
despair
the
horizon
of
sorrow
surveyed
from
the
height
of
a
thought
that
has
ceased
to
be
selfish
instinctive
or
commonplace
differs
but
little
from
the
horizon
of
happiness
when
this
last
is
regarded
from
the
height
of
a
thought
of
similar
nature
but
other
in
origin
and
after
all
it
matters
but
little
whether
the
clouds
be
golden
or
gloomy
that
yonder
float
over
the
plain
the
traveller
is
glad
to
have
reached
the
eminence
whence
his
eye
may
at
last
repose
on
illimitable
space
the
sea
is
not
the
less
marvellous
and
mysterious
to
us
though
white
sails
be
not
for
ever
flitting
over
its
surface
and
neither
tempest
nor
day
that
is
radiant
and
calm
is
able
to
bring
enfeeblement
unto
the
life
of
our
soul
enfeeblement
comes
through
our
dwelling
by
night
and
by
day
in
the
airless
room
of
our
cold
trivial
ungenerous
thoughts
at
a
time
when
the
sky
all
around
our
abode
is
reflecting
the
light
of
the
ocean
but
there
is
a
difference
perhaps
between
the
sage
and
the
thinker
it
may
be
that
sorrow
will
steal
over
the
thinker
as
he
stands
on
the
height
he
has
gained
but
the
sage
by
his
side
only
smiles
and
this
smile
is
so
loyal
so
human
and
natural
that
the
humblest
creature
of
all
must
needs
understand
and
will
gladly
welcome
it
to
him
as
it
falls
like
a
flower
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
thinker
throws
open
the
road
which
leads
from
the
seen
to
the
unseen
the
sage
throws
open
the
highway
that
takes
us
from
that
which
we
love
to
that
which
we
yet
shall
love
and
the
paths
that
ascend
from
that
which
has
ceased
to
console
to
that
which
for
long
time
to
come
shall
be
laden
with
deep
consolation
it
is
needful
but
not
to
have
reflected
deeply
and
boldly
on
man
and
nature
and
god
for
the
profoundest
thought
is
of
little
avail
if
it
contain
no
germ
of
comfort
indeed
it
is
only
thought
that
the
thinker
as
yet
does
nor
wholly
possess
as
the
other
thoughts
are
too
that
remain
outside
our
normal
everyday
life
it
is
easier
far
to
be
sad
and
dwell
in
affliction
than
at
once
to
do
what
time
in
the
end
will
always
compel
us
to
do
to
shake
ourselves
free
from
affliction
he
who
spends
his
days
gloomily
in
constant
mistrust
of
his
fellows
will
often
appear
a
profounder
thinker
than
the
other
who
lives
in
the
faith
and
honest
simplicity
wherein
all
men
should
dwell
is
there
a
man
can
believe
he
has
done
all
it
lay
in
his
power
to
do
if
as
he
meditates
thus
in
the
name
of
his
brethren
on
the
sorrows
of
life
he
hides
from
them
anxious
perhaps
not
to
weaken
his
grandiose
picture
of
sorrow
the
reasons
wherefore
he
accepts
life
reasons
that
must
be
decisive
since
he
himself
continues
to
live
the
thought
must
be
incomplete
surely
whose
object
is
not
to
console
it
is
easier
for
you
to
tell
me
the
cause
of
your
sorrow
than
very
simply
to
speak
of
the
deeper
the
weightier
reasons
that
induce
your
instinct
to
cling
to
this
life
whose
distress
you
bemoan
which
of
us
finds
not
unsought
many
thousands
of
reasons
for
sorrow
it
is
doubtless
of
service
that
the
sage
should
point
out
those
that
are
loftiest
for
the
loftiest
reasons
for
sorrow
must
be
on
the
eve
of
becoming
reasons
for
gladness
and
joy
but
reasons
that
have
not
within
them
these
germs
of
greatness
and
happiness
and
in
moral
life
open
spaces
abound
where
greatness
and
happiness
blend
these
are
surely
not
worthy
of
mention
before
we
can
bring
happiness
to
others
we
first
must
be
happy
ourselves
nor
will
happiness
abide
within
us
unless
we
confer
it
on
others
if
there
be
a
smile
upon
our
lips
those
around
us
will
soon
smile
too
and
our
happiness
will
become
the
truer
and
deeper
as
we
see
that
these
others
are
happy
it
is
not
seemly
that
i
who
willingly
have
brought
sorrow
to
none
should
permit
myself
to
be
sad
said
marcus
aurelius
in
one
of
his
noblest
passages
but
are
we
not
saddening
ourselves
and
learning
to
sadden
others
if
we
refuse
to
accept
all
the
happiness
offered
to
man
the
humble
thought
that
connects
a
mere
satisfied
glance
an
ordinary
everyday
act
of
simple
kindness
or
an
insignificant
moment
of
happiness
with
something
eternal
and
stable
and
beautiful
is
of
far
greater
value
and
infinitely
nearer
to
the
mystery
of
life
than
the
grand
and
gloomy
meditation
wherein
sorrow
love
and
despair
blend
with
death
and
destiny
and
the
apathetic
forces
of
nature
appearances
often
deceive
us
hamlet
bewailing
his
fate
on
the
brink
of
the
gulf
seems
profounder
imbued
with
more
passion
than
antoninus
pius
whose
tranquil
gaze
rests
on
the
forces
but
who
accepts
them
and
questions
them
calmly
instead
of
recoiling
in
horror
and
calling
down
curses
upon
them
our
slightest
gesture
at
nightfall
seems
more
momentous
by
far
than
all
we
have
done
in
the
day
but
man
was
created
to
work
in
the
light
and
not
to
burrow
in
darkness
the
smallest
consoling
idea
has
a
strength
of
its
own
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
most
magnificent
plaint
the
most
exquisite
expression
of
sorrow
the
vast
profound
thought
that
brings
with
it
nothing
but
sadness
is
energy
burning
its
wings
in
the
darkness
to
throw
light
on
the
walls
of
its
prison
but
the
timidest
thought
of
hope
or
of
cheerful
acceptance
of
inevitable
law
in
itself
already
is
action
in
search
of
a
foothold
wherefrom
to
take
flight
into
life
it
can
not
be
harmful
for
us
to
acknowledge
at
times
that
action
begins
with
reality
only
though
our
thoughts
be
never
so
large
and
disinterested
and
admirable
in
themselves
all
that
goes
to
build
up
what
is
truly
our
destiny
is
contained
in
those
of
our
thoughts
which
hurried
along
by
the
mass
of
ideas
still
obscure
indistinct
incomplete
have
had
strength
sufficient
or
been
forced
it
may
be
to
turn
into
facts
into
gestures
into
feelings
and
habits
we
do
not
imply
by
this
that
the
other
thoughts
should
be
neglected
those
that
surround
our
actual
life
may
perhaps
be
compared
with
an
army
besieging
a
city
the
city
once
taken
the
bulk
of
the
troops
would
probably
not
be
permitted
to
pass
through
the
gates
admission
would
be
doubtless
withheld
from
the
irregular
part
of
the
army
barbarians
mercenaries
all
those
in
a
word
whose
natural
tendencies
would
lead
them
to
drunkenness
pillage
or
bloodshed
and
it
might
also
very
well
happen
that
fully
of
the
troops
would
have
taken
no
part
in
the
final
decisive
battle
but
there
often
is
value
in
forces
that
appear
to
be
useless
and
the
city
would
evidently
not
have
yielded
to
panic
and
thrown
open
her
gates
had
the
force
at
the
foot
of
the
walls
not
been
flanked
by
the
hordes
in
the
valley
so
is
it
in
moral
life
too
those
thoughts
are
not
wholly
vain
that
have
been
unable
to
touch
our
actual
life
they
have
helped
on
supported
the
others
yet
is
it
these
others
alone
that
have
fully
accomplished
their
mission
and
therefore
does
it
behove
us
to
have
in
our
service
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
crowded
ranks
of
our
sad
and
bewildered
thoughts
a
group
of
ideas
more
human
and
confident
ready
at
all
times
to
penetrate
vigorously
into
life
even
when
our
endeavour
to
emerge
from
reality
is
due
to
the
purest
desire
for
immaterial
good
one
gesture
must
still
be
worth
more
than
a
thousand
intentions
nor
is
this
that
intentions
are
valueless
but
that
the
least
gesture
of
goodness
or
courage
or
justice
makes
demands
upon
us
far
greater
than
a
thousand
lofty
intentions
chiromantists
pretend
that
the
whole
of
our
life
is
engraved
on
our
palm
our
life
according
to
them
being
a
certain
number
of
actions
which
imprint
ineffaceable
marks
on
our
flesh
before
or
after
fulfilment
whereas
not
a
trace
will
be
left
by
either
thoughts
or
intentions
if
i
have
for
many
long
days
cherished
projects
of
murder
or
treachery
heroism
or
sacrifice
my
hand
will
tell
nothing
of
these
but
if
i
have
killed
some
one
involuntarily
perhaps
imagining
he
was
about
to
attack
me
or
if
i
have
rescued
a
child
from
the
flames
that
enwrapped
it
my
hand
will
bear
all
my
life
the
infallible
sign
of
love
or
of
murder
chiromancy
maybe
delusion
or
not
it
matters
but
little
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
great
moral
truth
that
underlies
this
distinction
the
place
that
i
fill
in
the
universe
will
never
be
changed
by
my
thought
i
shall
be
as
i
was
to
the
day
of
my
death
but
my
actions
will
almost
invariably
move
me
forwards
or
backwards
in
the
hierarchy
of
man
thought
is
a
solitary
wandering
fugitive
force
which
advances
towards
us
today
and
perhaps
on
the
morrow
will
vanish
whereas
every
deed
presupposes
a
permanent
army
of
ideas
and
desires
which
have
after
lengthy
effort
secured
in
reality
but
we
find
ourselves
here
far
away
from
the
noble
antigone
and
the
eternal
problem
of
unproductive
virtue
it
is
certain
that
destiny
understood
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
as
meaning
the
road
that
leads
only
to
death
is
wholly
disregardful
of
virtue
this
is
the
gulf
to
which
all
systems
of
morality
must
come
as
to
a
central
reservoir
to
be
purified
or
troubled
for
ever
and
here
must
each
man
decide
whether
he
will
justify
fate
or
condemn
it
sacrifice
may
well
be
regarded
as
the
type
of
all
such
as
are
made
in
the
cause
of
duty
do
we
not
all
of
us
know
of
heroic
deeds
whose
reward
has
been
only
misfortune
a
friend
of
my
own
one
day
as
he
lay
on
the
bed
he
was
never
to
leave
save
for
that
other
one
only
which
is
eternal
pointed
out
to
me
one
after
the
other
the
different
stratagems
fate
had
contrived
to
lure
him
to
the
distant
city
where
the
draught
of
poisonous
water
awaited
him
that
he
was
to
swallow
wherefrom
he
must
die
strangely
clear
were
the
countless
webs
that
destiny
had
spun
round
this
life
and
the
most
trivial
event
seemed
endowed
with
marvellous
malice
and
forethought
yet
had
my
friend
journeyed
forth
to
that
city
in
fulfilment
of
one
of
those
duties
that
only
the
saint
or
the
hero
the
sage
detects
on
the
horizon
of
conscience
what
can
we
say
but
let
us
leave
this
point
for
the
moment
to
return
to
it
later
my
friend
had
he
lived
would
on
the
morrow
have
gone
to
another
city
called
thither
by
another
duty
nor
would
he
have
paused
to
inquire
whether
it
was
indeed
duty
that
summoned
him
there
are
beings
who
do
thus
obey
the
commands
that
their
heart
whispers
low
they
fret
not
at
fortune
injustice
they
care
not
though
virtue
be
thankless
theirs
it
is
only
to
fight
the
injustice
of
men
which
is
the
only
injustice
whereof
they
as
yet
seem
aware
ought
we
never
to
hesitate
then
and
is
our
duty
most
faithfully
done
when
we
ourselves
are
wholly
unconscious
that
this
thing
that
we
do
is
a
duty
is
it
most
essential
of
all
that
we
should
attain
a
height
whence
duty
no
longer
is
looked
on
as
the
choice
of
our
noblest
feelings
but
as
the
silent
necessity
of
all
the
nature
within
us
there
are
some
who
wait
and
question
themselves
who
ponder
consider
and
then
at
length
decide
they
too
are
right
for
it
matters
but
little
whether
the
duty
fulfilled
be
result
of
instinct
or
intellect
the
gestures
of
instinct
will
often
recall
the
delicate
naive
and
vague
unexpected
beauty
that
clings
to
the
child
least
movement
and
touches
us
deeply
but
the
gestures
of
matured
resolve
have
a
beauty
too
of
their
own
more
earnest
and
statelier
stronger
it
is
given
to
very
few
hearts
to
be
naively
perfect
nor
should
we
go
seek
in
them
for
the
laws
of
duty
and
besides
there
is
many
a
duty
that
instinct
will
fail
to
perceive
that
yet
will
be
clearly
espied
by
mature
resolution
bereft
though
this
be
of
illusion
and
man
moral
value
is
doubtless
established
by
the
number
of
duties
he
sees
and
sets
forth
to
accomplish
it
is
well
that
the
bulk
of
mankind
should
listen
to
the
instinct
that
prompts
them
to
sacrifice
self
on
the
altar
of
duty
and
that
without
too
close
for
long
must
the
questioning
be
ere
consciousness
will
give
forth
the
same
answer
as
instinct
and
those
who
do
thus
close
their
eyes
and
in
all
meekness
follow
their
instinct
are
in
truth
following
the
light
that
is
borne
at
their
head
though
they
know
it
not
see
it
not
by
the
best
of
their
ancestors
but
still
this
is
not
the
ideal
and
he
who
gives
up
the
least
thing
of
all
for
the
sake
of
his
brother
well
knowing
what
it
is
he
gives
up
and
wherefore
he
does
it
stands
higher
by
far
in
the
scale
of
morality
than
the
other
who
flings
away
life
without
throwing
one
glance
behind
in
this
world
there
are
thousands
of
weak
noble
creatures
who
fancy
that
sacrifice
always
must
be
the
last
word
of
duty
thousands
of
beautiful
souls
that
know
not
what
should
be
done
and
seek
only
to
yield
up
their
life
holding
that
to
be
virtue
supreme
they
are
wrong
supreme
virtue
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
what
should
be
done
in
the
power
to
decide
for
ourselves
whereto
we
should
offer
our
life
the
duty
each
holds
to
be
his
is
by
no
means
his
permanent
duty
the
paramount
duty
of
all
is
to
throw
our
conception
of
duty
into
clearest
possible
light
the
word
duty
itself
will
often
contain
far
more
error
and
moral
indifference
than
virtue
clytemnestra
devoted
her
life
to
revenge
she
murdered
her
husband
for
that
he
had
slain
iphigenia
orestes
sacrificed
his
life
in
avenging
agamemnon
death
on
clytemnestra
and
yet
it
has
only
needed
a
sage
to
pass
by
saying
pardon
your
enemies
for
all
duties
of
vengeance
to
be
banished
for
ever
from
the
conscience
of
man
and
so
may
it
one
day
suffice
that
another
sage
shall
pass
by
for
many
a
duty
of
sacrifice
too
to
be
exiled
but
in
the
meanwhile
there
are
certain
ideas
that
prevail
on
renouncement
resignation
and
sacrifice
that
are
far
more
destructive
to
the
most
beautiful
moral
forces
of
man
than
great
vices
or
even
than
crimes
there
are
some
occasions
in
life
inevitable
and
of
general
bearing
that
demand
resignation
which
is
necessary
then
and
good
but
there
are
many
occasions
when
we
still
are
able
to
fight
and
at
such
times
resignation
is
no
more
than
veiled
helplessness
idleness
ignorance
so
is
it
with
sacrifice
too
which
indeed
is
most
often
the
withered
arm
resignation
still
shakes
in
the
void
there
is
beauty
in
simple
when
its
hour
has
come
unsought
when
its
motive
is
happiness
of
others
but
it
can
not
be
wise
or
of
use
to
mankind
to
make
sacrifice
the
aim
of
one
life
or
to
regard
its
achievement
as
the
magnificent
triumph
of
the
spirit
over
the
body
and
here
let
us
add
that
infinitely
too
great
importance
is
generally
ascribed
to
the
triumph
of
spirit
over
body
these
pretended
triumphs
being
most
often
the
total
defeat
of
life
sacrifice
may
be
a
flower
that
virtue
will
pluck
on
its
road
but
it
was
not
to
gather
this
flower
that
virtue
set
forth
on
its
travels
it
is
a
grave
error
to
think
that
the
beauty
of
soul
is
most
clearly
revealed
by
the
eager
desire
for
sacrifice
for
the
soul
fertile
beauty
resides
in
its
consciousness
in
the
elevation
and
power
of
its
life
there
are
some
it
is
true
that
awake
from
their
sleep
at
the
call
of
sacrifice
only
but
these
lack
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
seek
other
forms
of
moral
existence
it
is
as
a
rule
far
easier
to
sacrifice
self
to
give
up
that
is
our
moral
existence
to
the
first
one
who
chooses
to
take
it
than
to
fulfil
our
spiritual
destiny
to
accomplish
right
to
the
end
the
task
for
which
we
were
created
it
is
easier
far
as
a
rule
to
die
morally
nay
even
physically
for
others
than
to
learn
how
best
we
should
live
for
them
there
are
too
many
beings
who
thus
lull
to
sleep
all
initiative
personal
life
and
absorb
themselves
wholly
in
the
idea
that
they
are
prepared
and
ready
for
sacrifice
the
consciousness
that
never
succeeds
in
travelling
beyond
this
idea
that
is
satisfied
ever
to
seek
an
occasion
for
giving
all
that
which
it
has
is
a
consciousness
whose
eyes
are
sealed
and
that
crouches
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
is
beauty
in
the
giving
of
self
and
indeed
it
is
only
by
giving
oneself
that
we
do
at
the
end
begin
to
possess
ourselves
somewhat
but
if
all
that
we
some
day
shall
give
to
our
brethren
is
the
desire
to
give
them
ourselves
then
are
we
surely
preparing
a
gift
of
most
slender
value
before
giving
let
us
try
to
acquire
for
this
last
is
a
duty
where
from
we
are
not
relieved
by
the
fact
of
our
giving
let
us
wait
till
the
hour
of
sacrifice
sounds
till
then
each
man
to
his
work
the
hour
will
sound
at
last
but
let
us
not
waste
all
our
time
in
seeking
it
on
the
dial
of
life
there
are
many
ways
of
sacrifice
and
i
speak
not
here
of
the
of
the
strong
who
know
as
antigone
knew
how
to
yield
themselves
up
when
destiny
taking
the
form
of
their
brothers
manifest
happiness
calls
upon
them
to
abandon
their
own
happiness
and
their
life
i
speak
of
the
sacrifice
here
that
is
made
by
the
feeble
that
leans
for
support
with
childish
content
on
the
staff
of
its
own
inanity
that
is
as
an
old
blind
nurse
who
would
rock
us
in
the
palsied
arms
of
renouncement
and
useless
suffering
on
this
point
let
us
note
what
john
ruskin
says
one
of
the
best
thinkers
of
our
time
the
will
of
god
respecting
us
is
that
we
shall
live
by
each
happiness
and
life
not
by
each
other
misery
or
death
a
child
may
have
to
die
for
its
parents
but
the
purpose
of
heaven
is
that
it
shall
rather
live
for
them
that
not
by
sacrifice
but
by
its
strength
its
joy
its
force
of
being
it
shall
be
to
them
renewal
of
strength
and
as
the
arrow
in
the
hand
of
the
giant
so
it
is
in
all
other
right
relations
men
help
each
other
by
their
joy
not
by
their
sorrow
they
are
not
intended
to
slay
themselves
for
each
other
but
to
strengthen
themselves
for
each
other
and
among
the
many
apparently
beautiful
things
which
turn
through
mistaken
use
to
utter
evil
i
am
not
sure
but
that
the
thoughtlessly
meek
and
spirit
of
good
men
must
be
named
as
one
of
the
fatallest
they
have
so
often
been
taught
that
there
is
a
virtue
in
mere
suffering
as
such
that
they
accept
pain
and
defeat
as
if
these
were
their
appointed
portion
never
understanding
that
their
defeat
is
not
the
less
to
be
mourned
because
it
is
more
fatal
to
their
enemies
than
to
them
you
are
told
you
should
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
but
if
you
love
yourself
meanly
childishly
timidly
even
so
shall
you
love
your
neighbour
learn
therefore
to
love
yourself
with
a
love
that
is
wise
and
healthy
that
is
large
and
complete
this
is
less
easy
than
it
would
seem
there
is
more
active
charity
in
the
egoism
of
a
strenuous
clairvoyant
soul
than
in
all
the
devotion
of
the
soul
that
is
helpless
and
blind
before
you
exist
for
others
it
behoves
you
to
exist
for
yourself
before
giving
you
first
must
acquire
be
sure
that
if
deeply
considered
more
value
attaches
to
the
particle
of
consciousness
gained
than
to
the
gift
of
your
entire
unconsciousness
nearly
all
the
great
things
of
this
world
have
been
done
by
men
who
concerned
themselves
not
at
all
with
ideas
of
plato
thoughts
flew
on
he
paused
not
to
let
his
tears
fall
with
the
tears
of
the
mourners
in
athens
newton
pursued
his
experiments
calmly
nor
left
them
to
search
for
objects
of
pity
or
sorrow
and
marcus
aurelius
above
all
for
here
we
touch
on
the
most
frequent
and
dangerous
form
of
marcus
aurelius
essayed
not
to
dim
the
brightness
of
his
own
soul
that
he
might
confer
happiness
on
the
inferior
soul
of
faustina
and
if
this
was
right
in
the
lives
of
these
men
of
plato
and
newton
and
marcus
aurelius
it
is
equally
right
in
the
life
of
every
soul
for
each
soul
has
in
its
sphere
the
same
obligations
to
self
as
the
soul
of
the
greatest
we
should
tell
ourselves
once
and
for
all
that
it
is
the
first
duty
of
the
soul
to
become
as
happy
complete
independent
and
great
as
lies
in
its
power
herein
is
no
egoism
or
pride
to
become
effectually
generous
and
sincerely
humble
there
must
be
within
us
a
confident
tranquil
and
clear
comprehension
of
all
that
we
owe
to
ourselves
to
this
end
we
may
sacrifice
even
the
passion
for
sacrifice
for
sacrifice
never
should
be
the
means
of
ennoblement
but
only
the
sign
of
our
being
ennobled
let
us
be
ready
to
offer
when
necessity
beckons
our
wealth
and
our
time
and
our
life
to
our
less
fortunate
brethren
making
them
thus
an
exceptional
gift
of
a
few
exceptional
hours
but
the
sage
is
not
bound
to
neglect
his
happiness
and
all
that
environs
his
life
in
sole
preparation
for
these
few
exceptional
hours
of
greater
or
lesser
devotion
the
truest
morality
tells
us
to
cling
above
all
to
the
duties
that
return
every
day
to
acts
of
inexhaustible
brotherly
kindness
and
thus
considered
we
find
that
in
the
everyday
walk
of
life
the
solitary
thing
we
can
ever
distribute
among
those
who
march
by
our
side
be
they
joyful
or
sad
is
the
confidence
strength
the
freedom
and
peace
of
our
soul
let
the
humblest
of
men
therefore
never
cease
to
cherish
and
lift
up
his
soul
even
as
though
he
were
fully
convinced
that
this
soul
of
his
should
one
day
be
called
to
console
or
gladden
a
god
when
we
think
of
preparing
our
soul
the
preparation
should
never
be
other
than
befits
a
mission
divine
in
this
domain
only
and
on
this
condition
can
man
truly
give
himself
can
there
be
sacrifice
and
think
you
that
when
the
hour
sounds
the
gift
of
a
socrates
or
marcus
aurelius
who
lived
many
lives
for
many
a
time
had
they
compassed
their
whole
life
around
do
you
think
such
a
gift
is
not
worth
a
thousand
times
more
than
what
would
be
given
by
him
who
had
never
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
consciousness
and
if
god
there
be
will
he
value
sacrifice
only
by
the
weight
of
the
blood
in
our
body
and
the
blood
of
the
heart
its
virtue
its
knowledge
of
self
its
moral
existence
do
you
think
this
will
all
go
for
nothing
it
is
not
by
that
loftiness
comes
to
the
soul
but
as
the
soul
becomes
loftier
sacrifice
fades
out
of
sight
as
the
flowers
in
the
valley
disappear
from
the
vision
of
him
who
toils
up
the
mountain
sacrifice
is
a
beautiful
token
of
unrest
but
unrest
should
not
be
nurtured
within
us
for
sake
of
itself
to
the
soul
that
is
slowly
awakening
all
appears
sacrifice
but
few
things
indeed
are
so
called
by
the
soul
that
at
last
lives
the
life
whereof
pity
devotion
are
no
longer
indispensable
roots
but
only
invisible
flowers
for
in
truth
too
many
do
thus
feel
the
need
of
destroying
though
it
be
without
cause
a
happiness
love
or
a
hope
that
is
theirs
thereby
to
obtain
clearer
vision
of
self
in
the
light
of
the
consuming
flame
it
is
as
though
they
held
in
their
hand
a
lamp
of
whose
use
they
know
nothing
as
though
when
the
darkness
comes
on
and
they
are
eager
for
light
they
scatter
its
substance
abroad
on
the
fire
of
the
stranger
let
us
beware
lest
we
act
as
he
did
in
the
fable
who
stood
watch
in
the
lighthouse
and
gave
to
the
poor
in
the
cabins
about
him
the
oil
of
the
mighty
lanterns
that
served
to
illumine
the
sea
every
soul
in
its
sphere
has
charge
of
a
lighthouse
for
which
there
is
more
or
less
need
the
humblest
mother
who
allows
her
whole
life
to
be
crushed
to
be
saddened
absorbed
by
the
less
important
of
her
motherly
duties
is
giving
her
oil
to
the
poor
and
her
children
will
suffer
the
whole
of
their
life
from
there
not
having
been
in
the
soul
of
their
mother
the
radiance
it
might
have
acquired
the
immaterial
force
that
shines
in
our
heart
must
shine
first
of
all
for
itself
for
on
this
condition
alone
shall
it
shine
for
the
others
as
well
but
see
that
you
give
not
away
the
oil
of
your
lamp
though
your
lamp
be
never
so
small
let
your
gift
be
the
flame
its
crown
in
the
soul
that
is
noble
altruism
must
without
doubt
be
always
the
centre
of
gravity
but
the
weak
soul
is
apt
to
lose
itself
in
others
whereas
it
is
in
others
that
the
strong
soul
discovers
itself
here
we
have
the
essential
distinction
there
is
a
thing
that
is
loftier
still
than
to
love
our
neighbour
as
we
love
ourselves
it
is
to
love
ourselves
in
our
neighbour
some
souls
there
are
whom
goodness
walks
before
as
there
are
others
that
goodness
follows
let
us
never
forget
that
in
communion
of
soul
the
most
generous
by
no
means
are
they
who
believe
they
are
constantly
giving
a
strenuous
soul
never
ceases
to
take
though
it
be
from
the
poorest
a
weak
soul
always
is
giving
even
to
those
that
have
most
but
there
is
a
manner
of
giving
which
truly
is
only
the
gesture
of
powerless
greed
and
we
should
find
it
may
be
if
reckoning
were
kept
by
a
god
that
in
taking
from
others
we
give
and
in
giving
we
take
away
often
indeed
will
it
so
come
about
that
the
very
first
ray
of
enlightenment
will
descend
on
the
commonplace
soul
the
day
it
has
met
with
another
which
took
all
that
it
had
to
give
why
not
admit
that
it
is
not
our
paramount
duty
to
weep
with
all
those
who
are
weeping
to
suffer
with
all
who
are
sad
to
expose
our
heart
to
the
for
him
to
caress
or
stab
tears
and
suffering
and
wounds
are
helpful
to
us
only
when
they
do
not
discourage
our
life
let
us
never
forget
that
whatever
our
mission
may
be
in
this
world
whatever
the
aim
of
our
efforts
and
hopes
and
the
result
of
our
joys
and
our
sorrows
we
are
above
all
the
blind
custodians
of
life
absolutely
wholly
certain
is
that
one
thing
only
it
is
there
that
we
find
the
only
fixed
point
of
human
morality
life
has
been
given
us
for
a
reason
we
know
not
but
surely
not
for
us
to
enfeeble
it
or
carelessly
fling
it
away
for
it
is
a
particular
form
of
life
that
we
represent
on
this
planet
the
life
of
feeling
and
thought
whence
it
follows
perhaps
that
all
that
inclines
to
weaken
the
ardour
of
feeling
and
thought
is
in
its
essence
immoral
our
task
let
it
be
then
to
foster
this
ardour
to
enhance
and
embellish
it
let
us
constantly
strive
to
acquire
deeper
faith
in
the
greatness
of
man
in
his
strength
and
his
destiny
or
we
might
equally
say
in
his
bitterness
weakness
and
wretchedness
for
to
be
loftily
wretched
is
no
less
than
it
is
to
be
loftily
happy
after
all
it
matters
but
little
whether
it
be
man
or
the
universe
that
we
admire
so
long
as
something
appear
truly
admirable
to
us
and
exalt
our
sense
of
the
infinite
every
new
star
that
is
found
in
the
sky
will
lend
of
its
rays
to
the
passions
and
thoughts
and
the
courage
of
man
whatever
of
beauty
we
see
in
all
that
surrounds
us
within
us
already
is
beautiful
whatever
we
find
in
ourselves
that
is
great
and
adorable
that
do
we
find
too
in
others
if
my
soul
on
awaking
this
morning
was
cheered
as
it
dwelt
on
its
love
by
a
thought
that
drew
near
to
a
god
a
god
we
have
said
who
is
doubtless
no
more
than
the
loveliest
desire
of
our
soul
then
shall
i
behold
this
same
thought
astir
in
the
beggar
who
passes
my
window
the
moment
thereafter
and
i
shall
love
him
the
more
for
that
i
understand
him
the
better
and
let
us
not
think
that
love
of
this
kind
can
be
useless
for
indeed
if
one
day
we
shall
know
the
thing
that
has
to
be
done
it
will
only
be
thanks
to
the
few
who
love
in
this
fashion
with
an
love
from
the
conscious
and
infinite
love
must
the
true
morality
spring
nor
can
there
be
greater
charity
than
the
effort
to
ennoble
our
fellows
but
i
can
not
ennoble
you
if
i
have
not
become
noble
myself
i
have
no
admiration
to
give
you
if
there
be
naught
in
myself
i
admire
if
the
deed
i
have
done
be
heroic
its
truest
reward
will
be
my
conviction
that
of
an
equal
deed
you
are
capable
too
this
conviction
ever
will
tend
to
become
more
spontaneous
within
me
and
more
unconquerable
every
thought
that
quickens
my
heart
brings
quickening
too
to
the
love
and
respect
that
i
have
for
mankind
as
i
rise
aloft
you
rise
with
me
but
if
the
better
to
love
you
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
tear
off
the
wings
from
my
love
your
love
being
wingless
as
yet
then
shall
i
have
added
in
vain
to
the
plaints
and
the
tears
in
the
valley
but
brought
my
own
love
thereby
not
one
whit
nearer
the
mountain
our
love
should
always
be
lodged
on
the
highest
peak
we
can
attain
let
our
love
not
spring
from
pity
when
it
can
be
born
of
love
let
us
not
forgive
for
charity
sake
when
justice
offers
forgiveness
nor
let
us
try
to
console
there
where
we
can
respect
let
our
one
care
be
to
better
the
love
that
we
offer
our
fellows
one
cup
of
this
love
that
is
drawn
from
the
spring
on
the
mountain
is
worth
a
hundred
taken
from
the
stagnant
well
of
ordinary
charity
and
if
there
be
one
whom
you
no
longer
can
love
because
of
the
pity
you
feel
or
the
tears
that
he
sheds
and
if
he
ignore
to
the
end
that
you
love
him
because
you
ennobled
him
at
the
same
time
you
ennobled
yourself
it
matters
but
little
after
all
for
you
have
done
what
you
held
to
be
best
and
the
best
is
not
always
most
useful
should
we
not
invariably
act
in
this
life
as
though
the
god
whom
our
heart
desires
with
its
highest
desire
were
watching
our
every
action
in
a
terrible
catastrophe
that
took
place
but
a
short
time
ago
footnote
the
fire
at
the
bazar
de
la
charite
in
paris
destiny
afforded
yet
another
and
perhaps
the
most
startling
instance
of
what
it
pleases
men
to
term
her
injustice
her
blindness
or
her
irresponsibility
she
seemed
to
have
singled
out
for
especial
chastisement
the
solitary
external
virtue
that
reason
has
left
us
our
love
for
our
there
must
have
been
some
moderately
righteous
men
amongst
the
victims
and
it
seems
almost
certain
that
there
was
at
least
one
whose
virtue
was
wholly
disinterested
and
sincere
it
is
the
presence
of
this
one
truly
good
man
that
warrants
our
asking
in
all
its
simplicity
the
terrible
question
that
rises
to
our
lips
had
he
not
been
there
we
might
have
tried
to
believe
that
this
act
of
seemingly
monstrous
injustice
was
in
reality
composed
of
particles
of
sovereign
justice
we
might
have
whispered
to
ourselves
that
what
they
termed
charity
out
yonder
was
perhaps
only
the
arrogant
flower
of
permanent
injustice
we
seem
unwilling
to
recognise
the
blindness
of
the
external
forces
such
as
air
fire
water
the
laws
of
gravity
and
others
with
which
we
must
deal
and
do
battle
the
need
is
heavy
upon
us
to
find
excuses
for
fate
and
even
when
blaming
her
we
seem
to
be
endeavouring
still
to
explain
the
causes
of
her
past
and
her
future
action
conscious
the
while
of
a
feeling
of
pained
surprise
as
though
a
man
we
valued
highly
had
done
some
dreadful
deed
we
love
to
idealise
destiny
and
are
wont
to
credit
her
with
a
sense
of
justice
loftier
far
than
our
own
and
however
great
the
injustice
whereof
she
may
have
been
guilty
our
confidence
will
soon
flow
back
to
her
the
first
feeling
of
dismay
over
for
in
our
heart
we
plead
that
she
must
have
reasons
we
can
not
fathom
that
there
must
be
laws
we
can
not
divine
the
gloom
of
the
world
would
crush
us
were
we
to
dissociate
morality
from
fate
to
doubt
the
existence
of
this
high
protecting
justice
and
virtue
would
seem
to
us
to
be
denying
the
existence
of
all
justice
and
of
all
virtue
we
are
no
longer
able
to
accept
the
narrow
morality
of
positive
religion
which
entices
with
reward
and
threatens
with
punishment
and
yet
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
were
fate
possessed
of
the
most
rudimentary
sense
of
justice
our
conception
of
a
lofty
disinterested
morality
would
fade
into
thin
air
what
merit
in
being
just
ourselves
if
we
be
not
convinced
of
the
absolute
injustice
of
fate
we
no
longer
believe
in
the
ideals
once
held
by
saints
and
we
are
confident
that
a
wise
god
will
hold
of
as
little
account
the
duty
done
through
hope
of
recompense
as
the
evil
done
for
sake
of
gain
and
this
even
though
the
recompense
hoped
for
be
nothing
but
the
peace
of
mind
we
say
that
god
who
must
be
at
least
as
high
as
the
highest
thoughts
he
has
implanted
in
the
best
of
men
will
withhold
his
smile
from
those
who
have
desired
but
to
please
him
and
that
they
only
who
have
done
good
for
the
sake
of
good
and
as
though
he
existed
not
they
only
who
have
loved
virtue
more
than
they
loved
god
himself
shall
be
allowed
to
stand
by
his
side
and
yet
and
for
all
this
no
sooner
does
the
event
confront
us
than
we
discover
that
we
still
are
guided
by
the
moral
maxims
of
our
childhood
of
more
avail
would
be
a
list
of
chastised
virtues
the
soul
that
is
quick
with
life
would
find
its
profit
therein
the
cause
of
virtue
would
gain
in
vigour
and
in
majesty
let
us
not
forget
that
it
is
from
the
very
nonmorality
of
destiny
that
a
nobler
morality
must
spring
into
life
for
here
as
everywhere
man
is
never
so
strong
with
his
own
native
strength
as
when
he
realises
that
he
stands
entirely
alone
as
we
consider
the
crowning
injustice
of
fate
it
is
the
negation
of
high
moral
law
that
disturbs
us
but
from
this
negation
there
at
once
arises
a
moral
law
that
is
higher
still
he
who
no
longer
believes
in
reward
or
punishment
must
do
good
for
the
sake
of
good
even
though
a
moral
law
seem
on
the
eve
of
disappearing
we
need
have
no
cause
for
disquiet
its
place
will
be
speedily
filled
by
a
law
that
is
greater
still
to
attribute
morality
to
fate
is
but
to
lessen
the
purity
of
our
ideal
to
admit
the
injustice
of
fate
is
to
throw
open
before
us
the
fields
of
a
still
loftier
morality
let
us
not
think
virtue
will
crumble
though
god
himself
seem
unjust
where
shall
the
virtue
of
man
find
more
everlasting
foundation
than
in
the
seeming
injustice
of
god
let
us
not
cavil
therefore
at
nature
indifference
to
the
sage
it
is
only
because
we
are
not
yet
wise
enough
that
this
indifference
seems
strange
for
the
first
duty
of
wisdom
is
to
throw
into
light
the
humbleness
of
the
place
in
the
universe
that
is
filled
by
man
within
his
sphere
he
seems
of
importance
as
the
bee
in
its
cell
of
honey
but
it
were
idle
to
suppose
that
a
single
flower
the
more
will
blossom
in
the
fields
because
the
queen
bee
has
proved
herself
a
heroine
in
the
hive
we
need
not
fear
that
we
depreciate
ourselves
when
we
extol
the
universe
whether
it
be
ourselves
or
the
entire
world
that
we
consider
great
still
will
there
quicken
within
our
soul
the
sense
of
the
infinite
which
is
of
the
of
virtue
what
is
an
act
of
virtue
that
we
should
expect
such
mighty
reward
it
is
within
ourselves
that
reward
must
be
found
for
the
law
of
gravitation
will
not
swerve
they
only
who
know
not
what
goodness
is
are
ever
clamouring
for
the
wage
of
goodness
above
all
let
us
never
forget
that
an
act
of
goodness
is
of
itself
always
an
act
of
happiness
it
is
the
flower
of
a
long
inner
life
of
joy
and
contentment
it
tells
of
peaceful
hours
and
days
on
the
sunniest
heights
of
our
soul
no
reward
coming
after
the
event
can
compare
with
the
sweet
reward
that
went
with
it
the
upright
man
who
perished
in
the
catastrophe
i
mentioned
was
there
because
his
soul
had
found
a
peace
and
strength
in
virtue
that
not
happiness
love
or
glory
could
have
given
him
were
the
flames
to
retreat
before
such
men
were
the
waters
to
open
and
death
to
hesitate
what
were
righteousness
or
heroism
then
would
not
the
true
happiness
of
virtue
be
destroyed
virtue
that
is
happy
because
it
is
noble
and
pure
that
is
noble
and
pure
because
it
desires
no
reward
there
may
be
human
joy
in
doing
good
with
definite
purpose
but
they
who
do
good
expecting
nothing
in
return
know
a
joy
that
is
divine
where
we
do
evil
our
reasons
mostly
are
known
to
us
but
our
good
deed
becomes
the
purer
for
our
ignorance
of
its
motive
would
we
know
how
to
value
the
righteous
man
we
have
but
to
question
him
as
to
the
motives
of
his
righteousness
he
will
probably
be
the
most
truly
righteous
who
is
least
ready
with
his
answer
some
may
suppose
that
as
intellect
widens
many
a
motive
for
heroism
will
be
lost
to
the
soul
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
wider
intellect
brings
with
it
an
ideal
of
heroism
loftier
and
more
disinterested
still
and
this
much
at
least
is
certain
he
who
thinks
that
virtue
stands
in
need
of
the
approval
of
destiny
or
of
worlds
has
not
yet
within
him
the
veritable
sense
of
virtue
truly
to
act
well
we
must
do
good
because
of
our
craving
for
good
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
goodness
being
all
we
expect
in
return
with
no
witness
save
his
heart
alone
said
just
in
the
eyes
of
a
god
there
must
surely
be
marked
distinction
between
the
soul
of
the
man
who
believes
that
the
rays
of
a
virtuous
deed
shall
shine
through
furthest
space
and
the
soul
of
the
other
who
knows
they
illumine
his
heart
alone
there
may
be
greater
momentary
strength
in
the
overambitious
truth
but
the
strength
that
is
brought
by
the
humble
human
truth
is
far
more
earnest
and
patient
is
it
wiser
to
be
as
the
soldier
who
imagines
that
each
blow
he
strikes
brings
victory
nearer
or
as
the
other
who
knows
his
little
account
in
the
combat
but
still
fights
sturdily
on
the
upright
man
would
scorn
to
deceive
his
neighbour
but
is
ever
unduly
inclined
to
regard
some
measure
of
as
inseparable
from
his
ideal
if
there
were
profit
in
virtue
then
would
the
noblest
of
men
be
compelled
to
seek
happiness
elsewhere
and
god
would
destroy
their
main
object
in
life
were
he
to
reward
them
often
nothing
is
indispensable
perhaps
or
even
necessary
and
it
may
be
that
if
the
joy
of
doing
good
for
sake
of
good
were
taken
from
the
soul
it
would
find
other
purer
joys
but
in
the
meantime
it
is
the
most
beautiful
joy
we
know
therefore
let
us
respect
it
let
us
not
resent
the
misfortunes
that
sometimes
befall
virtue
lest
we
at
the
same
time
disturb
the
limpid
essence
of
its
happiness
the
soul
that
has
this
happiness
dreams
no
more
of
reward
than
others
expect
punishment
because
of
their
wickedness
they
only
are
ever
clamouring
for
justice
who
know
it
not
in
their
lives
there
is
wisdom
in
the
hindu
saying
work
as
they
work
who
are
ambitious
respect
life
as
they
respect
it
who
desire
it
be
happy
as
they
are
happy
who
live
for
happiness
alone
and
this
is
indeed
the
central
point
of
human
wisdom
to
act
as
though
each
deed
must
bear
wondrous
everlasting
fruit
and
yet
to
realise
the
insignificance
of
a
just
action
before
the
universe
to
grasp
the
disproportion
of
things
and
yet
to
march
onwards
as
though
the
proportions
were
established
by
man
to
keep
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
great
sphere
and
ourselves
to
move
in
the
little
sphere
with
as
much
confidence
and
earnestness
with
as
much
assurance
and
satisfaction
as
though
the
great
sphere
were
contained
within
it
is
there
need
of
illusion
to
keep
alive
our
desire
for
good
then
must
this
desire
stand
confessed
as
foreign
to
the
nature
of
man
it
is
a
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
heart
will
long
cherish
within
it
the
ideas
that
reason
has
banished
but
within
the
heart
there
is
much
that
reason
may
take
to
itself
and
at
last
the
heart
becomes
the
refuge
to
which
reason
is
apt
to
fly
ever
more
and
more
simply
each
time
that
the
night
steals
upon
it
for
it
is
to
the
heart
as
a
young
clairvoyant
girl
who
still
at
times
needs
advice
from
her
blind
but
smiling
mother
there
comes
a
moment
in
life
when
moral
beauty
seems
more
urgent
more
penetrating
than
intellectual
beauty
when
all
that
the
mind
has
treasured
must
be
bathed
in
the
greatness
of
soul
lest
it
perish
in
the
sandy
desert
forlorn
as
a
river
that
seeks
in
vain
for
the
sea
but
let
us
exaggerate
nothing
when
dealing
with
wisdom
though
it
be
wisdom
itself
the
external
forces
we
know
will
not
yield
to
the
righteous
man
but
still
he
is
absolute
lord
of
most
of
the
inner
powers
and
these
are
for
ever
spinning
the
web
of
nearly
all
our
happiness
and
sorrow
we
have
said
elsewhere
that
the
sage
as
he
passes
by
intervenes
in
countless
dramas
indeed
his
mere
presence
suffices
to
arrest
most
of
the
calamities
that
arise
from
error
or
evil
they
can
not
approach
him
or
even
those
who
are
near
him
a
chance
meeting
with
creature
endowed
with
simple
and
loving
wisdom
has
stayed
the
hands
of
men
who
else
had
committed
countless
acts
of
folly
or
wickedness
for
in
life
most
characters
are
subordinate
and
it
is
chance
alone
that
determines
whether
the
track
which
they
are
to
follow
shall
be
that
of
suffering
or
peace
the
atmosphere
around
rousseau
was
heavy
with
lamentation
and
treachery
delirium
deceit
and
cunning
whereas
jean
paul
moved
in
the
midst
of
loyalty
and
nobility
the
centre
of
peace
and
love
we
subdue
that
in
others
which
we
have
learned
to
subdue
in
ourselves
around
the
upright
man
there
is
drawn
a
wide
circle
of
peace
within
which
the
arrows
of
evil
soon
cease
to
fall
nor
have
his
fellows
the
power
to
inflict
moral
suffering
upon
him
for
indeed
if
our
tears
can
flow
because
of
our
enemies
malice
it
is
only
because
we
ourselves
would
fain
make
our
enemies
weep
if
the
shafts
of
envy
can
wound
and
draw
blood
it
is
only
because
we
ourselves
have
shafts
that
we
wish
to
throw
if
treachery
can
wring
a
groan
from
us
we
must
be
disloyal
ourselves
only
those
weapons
can
wound
the
soul
that
it
has
not
yet
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
love
the
dramas
of
virtue
are
played
on
a
stage
whose
mysteries
not
even
the
wisest
can
fathom
it
is
only
as
the
last
word
is
spoken
that
the
curtain
is
raised
for
an
instant
we
know
nothing
of
all
that
preceded
of
the
brightness
or
gloom
that
enwrapped
it
but
of
one
thing
at
least
the
just
man
may
be
certain
it
will
be
in
an
act
of
charity
or
justice
that
his
destiny
will
meet
him
face
to
face
the
blow
must
inevitably
find
him
prepared
in
a
state
of
grace
as
the
christian
calls
it
in
other
words
in
a
state
of
inner
happiness
and
that
in
itself
bars
the
door
on
evil
destiny
within
us
and
closes
most
of
the
gates
by
which
external
misfortune
can
enter
as
our
conception
of
duty
and
happiness
gains
in
dignity
so
does
the
sway
of
moral
suffering
become
the
more
restricted
and
purer
and
is
not
moral
suffering
the
most
tyrannical
weapon
in
the
armoury
of
destiny
our
happiness
mainly
depends
on
the
freedom
that
reigns
within
us
a
freedom
that
widens
with
every
good
deed
and
contracts
beneath
acts
of
evil
not
metaphorically
but
literally
does
marcus
aurelius
free
himself
each
time
he
discovers
a
new
truth
in
indulgence
each
time
that
he
pardons
each
time
he
reflects
still
less
of
a
metaphor
is
it
to
declare
that
macbeth
enchains
himself
anew
with
every
fresh
crime
and
if
this
be
true
of
the
great
crimes
of
kings
and
the
virtues
of
heroes
it
is
no
less
true
of
the
humblest
faults
and
most
hidden
virtues
of
ordinary
life
many
a
youthful
marcus
aurelius
is
still
about
us
many
a
macbeth
who
never
stirs
from
his
room
however
imperfect
our
conception
of
virtue
still
let
us
cling
to
it
for
a
forgetfulness
exposes
us
to
all
the
malignant
forces
from
without
the
simplest
lie
to
myself
buried
though
it
may
be
in
the
silence
of
my
soul
may
yet
be
as
dangerous
to
my
inner
liberty
as
an
act
of
treachery
on
the
marketplace
and
from
the
moment
that
my
inner
liberty
is
threatened
destiny
prowls
around
my
external
liberty
as
stealthily
as
a
beast
of
prey
that
has
long
been
tracking
its
victim
can
we
conceive
a
situation
in
life
wherein
a
man
who
is
truly
wise
and
noble
can
be
made
to
suffer
as
profoundly
as
the
man
who
follows
evil
in
this
world
it
is
far
more
certain
that
vice
will
be
punished
than
that
virtue
will
meet
with
reward
yet
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
the
habit
of
crime
to
shriek
aloud
beneath
its
punishment
whereas
virtue
rewards
itself
in
the
silence
that
is
the
walled
garden
of
its
happiness
evil
drags
horrid
catastrophe
behind
it
but
an
act
of
virtue
is
only
a
silent
offering
to
the
profoundest
laws
of
life
and
therefore
doubtless
does
the
balance
of
mighty
justice
seem
more
ready
to
incline
beneath
deeds
of
darkness
than
beneath
those
of
light
but
if
we
can
scarcely
believe
that
happiness
in
crime
be
possible
have
we
more
warrant
for
faith
in
the
unhappiness
of
virtue
we
know
that
the
executioner
can
stretch
spinoza
on
the
rack
and
that
terrible
disease
will
spare
antoninus
pius
no
more
than
goneril
or
regan
but
pain
such
as
this
belongs
to
the
animal
not
the
human
side
of
man
wisdom
has
indeed
sent
science
the
youngest
of
her
sisters
into
the
realm
of
destiny
with
the
mission
to
bring
the
zone
of
physical
suffering
within
limits
but
there
are
inaccessible
regions
within
that
realm
where
disaster
ever
will
rule
some
stricken
ones
there
will
always
be
victims
to
irreducible
injustice
and
yet
will
the
true
wisdom
in
the
midst
of
its
sorrow
only
be
fortified
thereby
only
gain
in
and
humanity
all
that
it
may
lose
in
more
mystic
qualities
we
become
truly
just
only
when
it
is
finally
borne
home
to
us
that
we
must
search
within
ourselves
for
our
model
of
justice
again
it
is
the
injustice
of
destiny
that
restores
man
to
his
place
in
the
universe
it
is
not
well
that
he
should
for
ever
be
pasting
anxious
glances
about
him
like
the
child
that
has
strayed
from
its
mother
side
nor
need
we
believe
that
these
disillusions
must
necessarily
give
rise
to
moral
discouragement
for
the
truth
that
seems
discouraging
does
in
reality
only
transform
the
courage
of
those
strong
enough
to
accept
it
and
in
any
event
a
truth
that
disheartens
because
it
is
true
is
still
of
far
more
value
than
the
most
stimulating
of
falsehoods
but
indeed
no
truth
can
discourage
whereas
much
that
passes
as
courage
only
bears
the
semblance
thereof
the
thing
that
enfeebles
the
weak
will
but
help
to
strengthen
the
strong
do
you
remember
the
day
wrote
a
woman
to
her
lover
when
we
sat
together
by
the
window
that
looked
on
to
the
sea
and
watched
the
meek
procession
of
ships
as
they
followed
each
other
into
harbour
ah
how
that
day
comes
back
to
me
do
you
remember
that
one
ship
had
a
sail
that
was
nearly
black
and
that
she
was
the
last
to
come
in
and
do
you
remember
too
that
the
hour
of
separation
was
upon
us
and
that
the
arrival
of
the
last
boat
of
all
was
to
be
our
signal
for
departure
we
might
perhaps
have
found
cause
for
sadness
in
the
gloomy
sail
that
fluttered
at
her
mast
but
we
who
loved
each
other
had
life
and
we
only
smiled
as
we
once
more
recognised
the
kinship
of
our
thoughts
yes
it
is
thus
we
should
act
and
though
we
can
not
always
smile
as
the
black
sail
heaves
in
sight
yet
is
it
possible
for
us
to
find
in
our
life
something
that
shall
absorb
us
to
the
exclusion
of
sadness
as
her
love
absorbed
the
woman
whose
words
i
have
quoted
complaints
of
injustice
grow
less
frequent
as
the
brain
and
the
heart
expand
it
is
well
to
remind
ourselves
that
in
this
world
whose
fruit
we
are
all
that
concerns
us
must
necessarily
be
more
conformable
with
our
existence
than
the
most
beneficent
law
of
our
imagination
the
time
has
arrived
perhaps
when
man
must
learn
to
place
the
centre
of
his
joys
and
pride
elsewhere
than
within
himself
as
this
idea
takes
firmer
root
within
us
so
do
we
become
more
conscious
of
our
helplessness
beneath
its
overwhelming
force
yet
is
it
at
the
same
time
borne
home
to
us
that
of
this
force
we
ourselves
form
part
and
even
as
we
writhe
beneath
it
we
are
compelled
to
admire
as
the
youthful
telemachus
admired
the
power
of
his
father
arm
our
own
instinctive
actions
awaken
within
us
an
eager
curiosity
an
affectionate
pleased
surprise
why
should
we
not
train
ourselves
thus
to
regard
the
instinctive
actions
of
nature
we
love
to
throw
the
dim
light
of
our
reason
on
to
our
unconsciousness
why
not
let
it
play
on
what
we
term
the
unconsciousness
of
the
universe
we
are
no
less
deeply
concerned
with
the
one
than
the
other
after
he
has
become
acquainted
with
the
power
that
is
in
him
said
a
philosopher
one
of
the
highest
privileges
of
man
is
to
realise
his
individual
powerlessness
out
of
the
very
disproportion
between
the
infinite
which
kills
us
and
this
nothing
that
we
are
there
arises
within
us
a
sensation
that
is
not
without
grandeur
we
feel
that
we
would
rather
be
crushed
by
a
mountain
than
done
to
death
by
a
pebble
as
in
war
we
would
rather
succumb
beneath
the
charge
of
thousands
than
fall
victim
to
a
single
arm
and
as
our
intellect
lays
bare
to
us
the
immensity
of
our
helplessness
so
does
it
rob
defeat
of
its
sting
who
knows
we
are
already
conscious
of
moments
when
the
something
that
has
conquered
us
seems
nearer
to
ourselves
than
the
part
of
us
that
has
yielded
of
all
our
characteristics
is
the
one
that
most
readily
changes
its
home
for
we
are
instinctively
aware
that
it
has
never
truly
formed
part
of
us
the
of
the
courtier
who
waits
on
the
mighty
king
soon
finds
more
splendid
lodging
in
the
king
boundless
power
and
the
disgrace
that
may
befall
him
will
wound
his
pride
the
less
for
that
it
has
descended
from
the
height
of
a
throne
were
nature
to
become
less
indifferent
it
would
no
longer
appear
so
vast
our
unfettered
sense
of
the
infinite
can
not
afford
to
dispense
with
one
particle
of
the
infinite
with
one
particle
of
its
indifference
and
there
will
ever
remain
something
within
our
soul
that
would
rather
weep
at
times
in
a
world
that
knows
no
limit
than
enjoy
perpetual
happiness
in
a
world
that
is
hemmed
in
if
destiny
were
invariably
just
in
her
dealings
with
the
wise
then
doubtless
would
the
existence
of
such
a
law
furnish
sufficient
proof
of
its
excellence
but
as
it
is
wholly
indifferent
it
is
better
so
and
perhaps
even
greater
for
what
the
actions
of
the
soul
may
lose
in
importance
thereby
does
but
go
to
swell
the
dignity
of
the
universe
and
loss
of
grandeur
to
the
sage
there
is
none
for
he
is
as
profoundly
sensitive
to
the
greatness
of
nature
as
to
the
greatness
that
lurks
within
man
why
harass
our
soul
with
endeavour
to
locate
the
infinite
as
much
of
it
as
can
be
given
to
man
will
go
to
him
who
has
learned
to
wonder
do
you
know
a
novel
of
balzac
belonging
to
the
celibataires
series
called
pierrette
it
is
not
one
of
balzac
masterpieces
but
it
has
points
of
much
interest
for
us
it
is
the
story
of
an
orphaned
breton
girl
a
sweet
innocent
child
who
is
suddenly
snatched
away
by
her
evil
star
from
the
grandparents
who
adore
her
and
transferred
to
the
care
of
an
aunt
and
uncle
monsieur
rogron
and
his
sister
sylvia
a
hard
gloomy
couple
these
two
retired
shopkeepers
who
live
in
a
dreary
house
in
the
back
streets
of
a
dreary
country
town
their
celibacy
weighs
heavily
upon
them
they
are
miserly
and
absurdly
vain
morose
and
instinctively
full
of
hatred
the
poor
inoffensive
girl
has
hardly
set
foot
in
the
house
before
her
martyrdom
begins
there
are
terrible
questions
of
money
and
economy
ambitions
to
be
gratified
marriages
to
be
prevented
inheritances
to
be
turned
aside
complications
of
every
kind
the
neighbours
and
friends
of
the
rogrons
behold
the
long
and
painful
sufferings
of
the
victim
with
unruffled
tranquillity
for
their
every
natural
instinct
leads
them
to
applaud
the
success
of
the
stronger
and
at
last
pierrette
dies
as
unhappily
as
she
has
lived
while
the
others
all
triumph
the
rogrons
the
detestable
lawyer
vinet
and
all
those
who
had
helped
them
and
the
subsequent
happiness
of
these
wretches
remains
wholly
untroubled
fate
would
even
seem
to
smile
upon
them
and
balzac
carried
away
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
reality
of
it
all
ends
his
story
almost
regretfully
with
these
words
how
the
social
villainies
of
this
world
would
thrive
under
our
laws
if
there
were
no
god
we
need
not
go
to
fiction
for
tragedies
of
this
kind
there
are
many
houses
in
which
they
are
matters
of
daily
occurrence
i
have
borrowed
this
instance
from
balzac
pages
because
the
story
lay
there
ready
to
hand
the
chronicle
day
by
day
of
the
triumph
of
injustice
the
very
highest
morality
is
served
by
such
instances
and
a
great
lesson
is
taught
and
perhaps
the
moralists
are
wrong
who
try
to
weaken
this
lesson
by
finding
excuses
for
the
iniquities
of
fate
some
are
satisfied
that
god
will
give
innocence
its
due
reward
others
tell
us
that
in
this
case
it
is
not
the
victim
who
has
the
greatest
claim
upon
our
sympathy
and
these
are
doubtless
right
from
many
points
of
view
for
little
pierrette
miserable
though
she
was
and
cruelly
tormented
did
yet
experience
joys
that
her
tyrants
never
would
know
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
she
remained
gentle
and
tender
and
loving
and
therein
lies
greater
happiness
than
in
hiding
cruelty
hatred
and
selfishness
beneath
a
smile
it
is
sad
to
love
and
be
unloved
but
sadder
still
to
be
unable
to
love
and
how
great
is
the
difference
between
the
petty
sordid
desires
the
grotesque
delights
of
the
rogrons
and
the
mighty
longing
that
filled
the
child
soul
as
she
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
injustice
at
last
should
cease
little
wistful
pierrette
was
perhaps
no
wiser
than
those
about
her
but
before
such
as
must
bear
unmerited
suffering
there
stretches
a
wide
horizon
which
here
and
again
takes
in
the
joys
that
only
the
loftiest
know
even
as
the
horizon
of
the
earth
though
not
seen
from
the
mountain
peak
would
appear
at
times
to
be
one
with
the
of
heaven
the
injustice
we
commit
speedily
reduces
us
to
petty
material
pleasures
but
as
we
revel
in
these
we
envy
our
victim
for
our
tyranny
has
thrown
open
the
door
to
joys
whereof
we
can
not
deprive
him
joys
that
are
wholly
beyond
our
reach
joys
that
are
purely
spiritual
and
the
door
that
opens
wide
to
the
victim
is
sealed
in
the
tyrant
soul
and
the
sufferer
breathes
a
purer
air
than
he
who
has
made
him
suffer
in
the
hearts
of
the
persecuted
there
is
radiance
where
those
who
persecute
have
only
gloom
and
is
it
not
on
the
light
within
us
that
the
wellbeing
of
happiness
depends
he
who
brings
sorrow
with
him
stifles
more
happiness
within
himself
than
in
the
man
he
overwhelms
which
of
us
had
he
to
choose
but
would
rather
be
pierrette
than
rogron
the
instinct
of
happiness
within
us
needs
no
telling
that
he
who
is
morally
right
must
be
happier
than
he
who
is
wrong
though
the
wrong
be
done
from
the
height
of
a
throne
and
even
though
the
rogrons
be
unaware
of
their
injustice
it
alters
nothing
for
be
we
aware
or
unaware
of
the
evil
we
commit
the
air
we
breathe
will
still
be
heavily
charged
nay
more
to
him
who
knows
he
does
wrong
there
may
come
perhaps
the
desire
to
escape
from
his
prison
but
the
other
will
die
in
his
cell
without
even
his
thoughts
having
travelled
beyond
the
gloomy
walls
that
conceal
from
him
the
true
destiny
of
man
why
seek
justice
where
it
can
not
be
and
where
can
it
be
save
in
our
soul
its
language
is
the
natural
language
of
the
spirit
of
man
but
this
spirit
must
learn
new
words
ere
it
can
travel
in
the
universe
justice
is
the
very
last
thing
of
all
wherewith
the
universe
concerns
itself
it
is
equilibrium
that
absorbs
its
attention
and
what
we
term
justice
is
truly
nothing
but
this
equilibrium
transformed
as
honey
is
nothing
but
a
transformation
of
the
sweetness
found
in
the
flower
outside
man
there
is
no
justice
within
him
injustice
can
not
be
the
body
may
revel
in
ill
gotten
pleasure
but
virtue
alone
can
bring
contentment
to
the
soul
our
inner
happiness
is
measured
out
to
us
by
an
incorruptible
judge
and
the
mere
endeavour
to
corrupt
him
still
further
reduces
the
sum
of
the
final
veritable
happiness
he
lets
fall
into
the
shining
scale
it
is
lamentable
enough
that
a
rogron
should
be
able
to
torture
a
helpless
child
and
darken
the
few
hours
of
life
the
chance
of
the
world
had
given
but
injustice
there
would
be
only
if
his
wickedness
procured
him
the
inner
happiness
and
peace
the
elevation
of
thought
and
habit
that
long
years
spent
in
love
and
meditation
had
procured
for
spinoza
and
marcus
aurelius
some
slight
intellectual
satisfaction
there
may
be
in
the
doing
of
evil
but
none
the
less
does
each
wrongful
deed
clip
the
wings
of
our
thoughts
till
at
length
they
can
only
crawl
amidst
all
that
is
fleeting
and
personal
to
commit
an
act
of
injustice
is
to
prove
we
have
not
yet
attained
the
happiness
within
our
grasp
and
in
evil
reduce
things
to
their
primal
elements
and
you
shall
find
that
even
the
wicked
are
seeking
some
measure
of
peace
a
certain
of
soul
they
may
think
themselves
happy
and
rejoice
for
such
dole
as
may
come
to
them
but
would
it
have
satisfied
marcus
aurelius
who
knew
the
lofty
tranquillity
the
great
quickening
of
the
soul
show
a
vast
lake
to
the
child
who
has
never
beheld
the
sea
it
will
clap
its
hands
and
be
glad
and
think
the
sea
is
before
it
but
therefore
none
the
less
does
the
veritable
sea
exist
it
may
be
that
a
man
will
find
happiness
in
the
puny
little
victories
that
his
vanity
envy
or
indifference
win
for
him
day
after
day
shall
we
begrudge
him
such
happiness
we
whose
eyes
can
see
further
shall
we
strive
for
his
consciousness
of
life
for
the
religion
that
pleases
his
soul
for
the
conception
of
the
universe
that
justifies
his
cares
yet
out
of
these
things
are
the
banks
made
between
which
happiness
flows
and
as
they
are
so
shall
the
river
be
in
shallowness
or
in
depth
he
may
believe
that
there
is
a
god
or
that
there
is
no
god
that
all
ends
in
this
world
or
that
it
is
prolonged
into
the
next
that
all
is
matter
or
that
all
is
spirit
he
will
believe
these
things
much
as
wise
men
believe
them
but
do
you
think
his
manner
of
belief
can
be
the
same
to
look
fearlessly
upon
life
to
accept
the
laws
of
nature
not
with
meek
resignation
but
as
her
sons
who
dare
to
search
and
question
to
have
peace
and
confidence
within
our
soul
these
are
the
beliefs
that
make
for
happiness
but
to
believe
is
not
enough
all
depends
on
how
we
believe
i
may
believe
that
there
is
no
god
that
i
am
that
my
brief
sojourn
here
serves
no
purpose
that
in
the
economy
of
this
world
without
limit
my
existence
counts
for
as
little
as
the
evanescent
hue
of
a
flower
i
may
believe
all
this
in
a
deeply
religious
spirit
with
the
infinite
throbbing
within
me
you
may
believe
in
one
god
who
cherishes
and
protects
you
yet
your
belief
may
be
mean
and
petty
and
small
i
shall
be
happier
than
you
and
calmer
if
my
doubt
is
greater
and
nobler
and
more
earnest
than
is
your
faith
if
it
has
probed
more
deeply
into
my
soul
traversed
wider
horizons
if
there
are
more
things
it
has
loved
and
if
the
thoughts
and
feelings
on
which
my
doubt
reposes
have
become
vaster
and
purer
than
those
that
support
your
faith
then
shall
the
god
of
my
disbelief
become
mightier
and
of
supremer
comfort
than
the
god
to
whom
you
cling
for
indeed
belief
and
unbelief
are
mere
empty
words
not
so
the
loyalty
the
greatness
and
profoundness
of
the
reasons
wherefore
we
believe
or
do
not
believe
we
do
not
choose
these
reasons
they
are
rewards
that
have
to
be
earned
those
we
have
chosen
are
only
slaves
we
have
happened
to
buy
and
their
life
is
but
feeble
they
hold
themselves
shyly
aloof
ever
watching
for
a
chance
to
escape
but
the
reasons
we
have
deserved
stand
faithfully
by
us
they
are
so
many
pensive
antigones
on
whose
help
we
may
ever
rely
nor
can
such
reasons
as
these
be
forcibly
lodged
in
the
soul
for
indeed
they
must
have
dwelt
there
from
earliest
days
have
spent
their
childhood
there
nourished
on
our
every
thought
and
action
and
tokens
recalling
a
life
of
devotion
and
love
must
surround
them
on
every
side
and
as
they
throw
deeper
root
as
the
mists
clear
away
from
our
soul
and
reveal
a
still
wider
horizon
so
does
the
horizon
of
happiness
widen
also
for
it
is
only
in
the
space
that
our
thoughts
and
our
feelings
enclose
that
our
happiness
can
breathe
in
freedom
it
demands
no
material
space
but
finds
ever
too
narrow
the
spiritual
fields
we
throw
open
wherefore
we
must
unceasingly
endeavour
to
enlarge
its
territory
until
such
time
as
soaring
up
on
high
it
finds
sufficient
aliment
in
the
space
which
it
does
of
itself
fling
open
then
it
is
and
then
only
that
happiness
truly
illumines
the
most
eternal
most
human
part
of
man
and
indeed
all
other
forms
of
happiness
are
merely
unconscious
fragments
of
this
great
happiness
which
as
it
reflects
and
looks
before
it
is
conscious
of
no
limit
within
itself
or
in
all
that
surrounds
it
this
space
must
dwindle
daily
in
those
who
follow
evil
seeing
that
their
thoughts
and
feelings
must
of
necessity
dwindle
also
but
the
man
who
has
risen
somewhat
will
soon
forsake
the
ways
of
evil
for
look
deep
down
enough
and
you
shall
ever
find
its
origin
in
straitened
feeling
and
stunted
thought
he
does
evil
no
longer
because
his
thoughts
are
purer
and
higher
and
now
that
he
is
incapable
of
evil
his
thoughts
will
become
purer
still
and
thus
do
our
thoughts
and
actions
having
won
their
way
into
the
placid
heaven
where
no
barrier
restrains
the
soul
become
as
inseparable
as
the
wings
of
a
bird
and
what
to
the
bird
was
only
a
law
of
equilibrium
is
here
transformed
into
a
law
of
justice
who
can
tell
whether
the
satisfaction
derived
from
evil
can
ever
penetrate
to
the
soul
unless
there
mingle
with
it
a
vague
desire
a
promise
a
distant
hope
of
goodness
or
of
pity
the
joy
of
the
wretch
whose
victim
lies
in
his
power
is
perhaps
unredeemed
in
its
gloom
and
futility
save
by
the
thought
of
mercy
that
flashes
across
him
evil
at
times
would
seem
compelled
to
beg
a
ray
of
light
from
virtue
to
shed
lustre
on
its
triumph
is
it
possible
for
a
man
to
smile
in
his
hatred
and
not
borrow
the
smile
of
love
but
the
smile
will
be
for
here
as
everywhere
there
is
no
inner
injustice
within
the
soul
the
mark
of
happiness
is
always
level
with
that
of
justice
or
charity
which
words
i
use
here
indifferently
for
indeed
what
is
charity
or
love
but
justice
with
naught
to
do
but
count
its
jewels
the
man
who
goes
forth
to
seek
his
happiness
in
evil
does
merely
prove
thereby
that
he
is
less
happy
than
the
other
who
watches
and
disapproves
and
yet
his
object
is
identical
with
that
of
the
upright
man
he
too
is
in
search
of
happiness
of
some
sort
of
peace
and
certainty
of
what
avail
to
punish
him
we
do
not
blame
the
poor
because
their
home
is
not
a
palace
it
is
sad
enough
to
be
compelled
to
live
in
a
hovel
he
whose
eyes
can
see
the
invisible
knows
that
in
the
soul
of
the
most
unjust
man
there
is
justice
still
justice
with
all
her
attributes
her
stainless
garments
and
holy
activity
he
knows
that
the
soul
of
the
sinner
is
ever
balancing
peace
and
love
and
the
consciousness
of
life
no
less
scrupulously
than
the
soul
of
philosopher
saint
or
hero
that
it
watches
the
smiles
of
earth
and
sky
and
is
no
less
aware
of
all
whereby
those
smiles
are
destroyed
degraded
and
poisoned
we
are
not
wrong
perhaps
to
be
heedful
of
justice
in
the
midst
of
a
universe
that
heeds
not
at
all
as
the
bee
is
not
wrong
to
make
honey
in
a
world
that
itself
can
make
none
but
we
are
wrong
to
desire
an
external
justice
since
we
know
that
it
does
not
exist
let
that
which
is
in
us
suffice
all
is
for
ever
being
weighed
and
judged
in
our
soul
it
is
we
who
shall
judge
ourselves
or
rather
our
happiness
is
our
judge
it
may
be
urged
that
virtue
is
subject
to
defeat
and
disappointment
no
less
than
vice
but
the
defeats
and
disappointments
of
virtue
bring
with
them
no
gloom
or
distress
for
they
do
but
tend
to
soothe
and
enlighten
our
thoughts
an
act
of
virtue
may
sink
into
the
void
but
it
is
then
most
of
all
that
we
learn
to
gauge
the
depths
of
life
and
of
soul
and
often
will
it
fall
into
these
depths
like
a
radiant
stone
beside
which
our
thoughts
loom
pale
with
every
vicious
scheme
that
fails
before
the
innocence
of
pierrette
madame
soul
shrivels
anew
whereas
the
clemency
of
titus
falling
on
thankless
soil
docs
but
induce
him
to
lift
his
eyes
on
high
far
beyond
love
or
pardon
there
is
no
gain
in
shutting
out
the
world
though
it
be
with
walls
of
righteousness
the
last
gesture
of
virtue
should
be
that
of
an
angel
flinging
open
the
door
we
should
welcome
our
disillusions
for
were
it
the
will
of
destiny
that
our
pardon
should
always
transform
an
enemy
into
a
brother
then
should
we
go
to
our
grave
still
unaware
of
all
that
springs
to
light
within
us
beneath
the
act
of
unwise
clemency
whose
unwisdom
we
never
regret
we
should
die
without
once
having
matched
all
that
is
best
in
our
soul
against
the
forces
that
hedge
life
around
the
kindly
deed
that
is
wasted
the
lofty
or
only
loyal
thought
that
falls
on
barren
ground
these
too
have
their
value
for
the
light
they
throw
differs
far
from
the
radiance
triumphant
virtue
suffuses
and
thus
may
we
see
many
things
in
their
differing
aspect
there
were
surely
much
joy
in
the
thought
that
love
must
invariably
triumph
but
greater
joy
is
there
still
in
tearing
aside
this
illusion
am
marching
straight
on
to
the
truth
man
has
been
but
too
prone
said
a
philosopher
whom
death
carried
off
too
soon
man
has
been
but
too
prone
through
all
the
course
of
his
history
to
lodge
his
dignity
within
his
errors
and
to
look
upon
truth
as
a
thing
that
depreciated
himself
it
may
sometimes
seem
less
glorious
than
illusion
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
true
in
the
whole
domain
of
thought
there
is
nothing
loftier
than
truth
and
there
is
no
bitterness
herein
for
indeed
to
the
sage
truth
can
never
be
bitter
he
too
has
had
his
longings
in
the
past
has
conceived
that
truth
might
move
mountains
that
a
loving
act
might
for
ever
soften
the
hearts
of
men
but
he
has
learned
to
prefer
that
this
should
not
be
so
nor
is
it
overweening
pride
that
thus
has
changed
him
he
does
not
think
himself
more
virtuous
than
the
universe
it
is
his
insignificance
in
the
universe
that
has
been
made
clear
to
him
it
is
no
longer
for
the
spiritual
fruit
it
bears
that
he
tends
the
love
of
justice
he
has
found
implanted
in
his
soul
but
for
the
living
flowers
that
spring
up
within
him
and
because
of
his
deep
respect
for
all
created
things
he
has
no
curses
for
the
ungrateful
friend
nor
even
for
ingratitude
itself
he
does
not
say
i
am
better
than
that
man
or
i
shall
not
fall
into
that
vice
but
he
is
taught
by
ingratitude
that
benevolence
contains
joys
that
are
greater
than
those
that
gratitude
can
bestow
joys
that
are
less
personal
but
more
in
harmony
with
life
as
a
whole
he
finds
more
pleasure
in
the
attempt
to
understand
that
which
is
than
in
the
struggle
to
believe
that
which
he
desires
for
a
long
time
he
has
been
like
the
beggar
who
was
suddenly
borne
away
from
his
hut
and
lodged
in
a
magnificent
palace
he
awoke
and
threw
uneasy
glances
about
him
seeking
in
that
immense
hall
for
the
squalid
things
he
remembered
to
have
had
in
his
tiny
room
where
were
the
hearth
the
bed
the
table
stool
and
basin
the
humble
torch
of
his
vigils
still
trembled
by
his
side
but
its
light
could
not
reach
the
lofty
ceiling
the
little
wings
of
flame
threw
their
feeble
flicker
on
to
a
pillar
close
by
which
was
all
that
stood
out
from
the
darkness
but
little
by
little
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
his
new
abode
he
wandered
through
room
after
room
and
rejoiced
as
profoundly
at
all
that
his
torch
left
in
darkness
as
at
all
that
it
threw
into
light
at
first
he
could
have
wished
in
his
heart
that
the
doors
had
been
somewhat
less
lofty
the
staircases
not
quite
so
ample
the
galleries
less
lost
in
gloom
but
as
he
went
straight
before
him
he
felt
all
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
that
which
was
yet
so
unlike
the
home
of
his
dream
he
rejoiced
to
discover
that
here
bed
and
table
were
not
the
centre
round
which
all
revolved
as
it
had
been
with
him
in
his
hut
he
was
glad
that
the
palace
had
not
been
built
to
conform
with
the
humble
habits
his
misery
had
forced
upon
him
he
even
learned
to
admire
the
things
that
defeated
his
hopes
for
they
enabled
his
eyes
to
see
deeper
the
sage
is
consoled
and
fortified
by
everything
that
exists
for
indeed
it
is
of
the
essence
of
wisdom
to
seek
out
all
that
exists
and
to
admit
it
within
its
circle
wisdom
even
admits
the
rogrons
for
she
holds
life
of
profounder
interest
than
even
justice
or
virtue
and
where
her
attention
is
disputed
by
a
virtue
lost
in
abstraction
and
by
a
humble
life
she
will
incline
to
the
humble
life
and
not
to
the
magnificent
virtue
that
holds
itself
proudly
aloof
it
is
of
the
nature
of
wisdom
to
despise
nothing
indeed
in
this
world
there
is
perhaps
only
one
thing
truly
contemptible
and
that
thing
is
contempt
itself
thinkers
too
often
are
apt
to
despise
those
who
go
through
life
without
thinking
thought
is
doubtless
of
high
value
our
first
endeavour
should
be
to
think
as
often
and
as
well
as
we
can
but
for
all
that
it
is
somewhat
beside
the
mark
to
believe
that
the
possession
or
lack
of
a
certain
faculty
for
handling
general
ideas
can
interpose
an
actual
barrier
between
men
after
all
the
difference
between
the
greatest
thinker
and
the
smallest
provincial
burgher
is
often
only
the
difference
between
a
truth
that
can
sometimes
express
itself
and
a
truth
that
can
never
crystallise
into
form
the
difference
is
considerable
a
gap
but
not
a
chasm
the
higher
our
thoughts
ascend
the
vainer
and
the
more
arbitrary
seems
the
distinction
between
him
who
is
thinking
always
and
him
who
thinks
not
yet
the
little
burgher
is
full
of
prejudice
and
of
passions
at
which
we
smile
his
ideas
are
small
and
petty
and
sometimes
contemptible
enough
and
yet
place
him
side
by
side
with
the
sage
before
essential
circumstance
of
life
before
love
grief
death
before
something
that
calls
for
true
heroism
and
it
shall
happen
more
than
once
that
the
sage
will
turn
to
his
humble
companion
as
to
the
guardian
of
a
truth
no
less
profound
no
less
deeply
human
than
his
own
there
are
moments
when
the
sage
realises
that
his
spiritual
treasures
are
naught
that
it
is
only
a
few
words
or
habits
that
divide
him
from
other
men
there
are
moments
when
he
even
doubts
the
value
of
those
words
those
are
the
moments
when
wisdom
flowers
and
sends
forth
blossom
thought
may
sometimes
deceive
and
the
thinker
who
goes
astray
must
often
retrace
his
footsteps
to
the
spot
whence
those
who
think
not
have
never
moved
away
where
they
still
remain
faithfully
seated
round
the
silent
essential
truth
they
are
the
guardians
of
the
of
the
tribe
the
others
take
lighted
torches
and
go
wandering
abroad
but
when
the
air
grows
heavy
and
threatens
the
feeble
flame
then
is
it
well
to
turn
back
and
draw
close
to
the
once
more
these
fires
seem
never
to
stir
from
the
spot
where
they
always
have
been
but
in
truth
they
ever
are
moving
keeping
time
with
the
worlds
and
their
flame
marks
the
hour
of
humanity
on
the
dial
of
the
universe
we
know
exactly
how
much
the
inert
forces
owe
to
the
thinker
we
forget
the
deep
indebtedness
of
the
thinker
to
inert
force
in
a
world
where
all
were
thinkers
more
than
one
indispensable
truth
might
perhaps
for
ever
be
lost
for
indeed
the
thinker
must
never
lose
touch
with
those
who
do
not
think
as
his
thoughts
would
then
quickly
cease
to
be
just
or
profound
to
disdain
is
only
too
easy
not
so
to
understand
but
in
him
who
is
truly
wise
there
passes
no
thought
of
disdain
but
it
will
sooner
or
later
evolve
into
full
comprehension
the
thought
that
can
travel
scornfully
over
the
heads
of
that
great
silent
throng
without
recognising
its
myriad
brothers
and
sisters
that
are
slumbering
there
in
its
midst
is
only
too
often
merely
a
sterile
vicious
dream
we
do
well
to
remind
ourselves
at
times
that
the
spiritual
no
less
than
the
physical
atmosphere
demands
more
nitrogen
than
oxygen
for
the
air
to
be
breathed
by
man
it
need
not
surprise
us
that
thinkers
like
balzac
should
have
loved
to
dwell
on
these
humble
lives
eternal
sameness
runs
through
them
and
yet
does
each
century
mark
profoundest
change
in
the
atmosphere
that
enwraps
them
the
sky
above
has
altered
but
these
simple
lives
have
ever
the
gestures
and
it
is
these
unchanging
gestures
that
tell
of
the
altered
sky
a
great
deed
of
heroism
fascinates
us
our
eye
can
not
travel
beyond
the
act
itself
but
insignificant
thoughts
and
deeds
lead
us
on
to
the
horizon
beyond
them
and
is
not
the
shining
star
of
human
wisdom
always
situate
on
the
horizon
if
we
could
see
these
things
as
nature
sees
them
with
her
thoughts
and
feelings
we
should
realise
that
the
uniform
mediocrity
that
runs
through
these
lives
can
not
truly
be
mediocre
from
the
mere
fact
of
its
uniformity
and
indeed
this
matters
but
little
we
can
never
judge
another
soul
above
the
mark
of
our
own
and
however
insignificant
a
creature
may
seem
to
us
at
first
as
our
own
soul
emerges
from
shadow
so
does
the
shadow
lift
from
him
there
is
nothing
our
eyes
behold
that
is
too
small
to
deserve
our
love
and
there
where
we
can
not
love
we
have
only
to
raise
our
lamp
till
it
reaches
the
level
of
love
and
then
throw
its
light
around
let
only
one
ray
of
this
light
go
forth
every
day
from
our
soul
we
may
then
be
content
it
matters
not
where
the
light
falls
there
is
not
a
thing
in
this
world
whereupon
your
glance
or
your
thought
can
rest
but
contains
within
it
more
treasure
than
either
of
these
can
fathom
nor
is
there
a
thing
so
small
but
it
has
a
vastness
within
that
the
light
that
a
soul
can
spare
can
at
best
but
faintly
illumine
is
not
the
very
essence
of
human
destiny
stripped
of
the
details
that
bewilder
us
to
be
found
in
the
most
ordinary
lives
the
mighty
struggle
of
morality
on
the
heights
is
glorious
to
witness
but
so
will
a
keen
observer
profoundly
admire
a
magnificent
tree
that
stands
alone
in
a
desert
and
his
contemplation
over
once
more
go
back
to
the
forest
where
there
are
no
marvellous
trees
but
trees
in
countless
abundance
the
immense
forest
is
doubtless
made
up
of
ordinary
branches
and
stems
but
is
it
not
vast
is
it
not
as
it
should
be
seeing
that
it
is
the
forest
not
by
the
exceptional
shall
the
last
word
ever
be
spoken
and
indeed
what
we
call
the
sublime
should
be
only
a
clearer
profounder
insight
into
all
that
is
perfectly
normal
it
is
of
service
often
to
watch
those
on
the
peaks
who
do
battle
but
it
is
well
too
not
to
forget
those
in
the
valley
below
who
fight
not
at
all
as
we
see
all
that
happens
to
these
whose
life
knows
no
struggle
as
we
realise
how
much
must
be
conquered
in
us
before
we
can
rightly
distinguish
their
narrower
joys
from
the
joy
known
to
them
who
are
striving
on
high
then
perhaps
does
the
struggle
itself
appear
to
become
less
important
but
for
all
that
we
love
it
the
more
and
the
reward
is
the
sweeter
to
us
for
the
silence
that
enwraps
its
coming
nor
is
this
from
a
desire
to
keep
our
happiness
secret
such
as
a
crafty
courtier
might
feel
who
hugs
fortune
favours
to
him
but
perhaps
because
it
is
only
when
happiness
thus
whispers
low
in
our
ear
and
no
other
men
know
that
it
is
not
according
us
joys
that
are
filched
from
our
brother
share
then
do
we
no
longer
say
to
ourselves
as
we
look
on
those
brothers
how
great
is
the
distance
between
such
as
these
and
myself
but
in
all
simplicity
do
we
murmur
at
last
to
ourselves
the
loftier
my
thoughts
become
the
less
is
there
to
divide
me
from
the
humblest
of
my
from
those
who
are
most
plentiful
on
earth
and
every
step
that
i
take
towards
an
uncertain
ideal
is
a
step
that
brings
me
the
nearer
to
those
whom
i
once
despised
in
the
vanity
and
ignorance
of
my
earliest
days
after
all
what
is
a
humble
life
it
is
thus
we
choose
to
term
the
life
that
ignores
itself
that
drains
itself
dry
in
the
place
of
its
birth
a
life
whose
feelings
and
thoughts
whose
desires
and
passions
entwine
themselves
around
the
most
insignificant
things
but
it
suffices
to
look
at
a
life
for
that
life
to
seem
great
a
life
in
itself
can
be
neither
great
nor
small
the
largeness
is
all
in
the
eye
that
surveys
it
and
an
existence
that
all
men
hold
to
be
lofty
and
vast
is
one
that
has
long
been
accustomed
to
look
loftily
on
itself
from
within
if
you
have
never
done
this
your
life
must
be
narrow
but
the
man
who
watches
you
live
will
discern
in
the
very
obscurity
of
the
corner
you
fill
an
element
of
horizon
a
foothold
to
cling
to
whence
his
thoughts
will
rise
with
surer
and
more
human
strength
there
is
not
an
existence
about
us
but
at
first
seems
colourless
dreary
lethargic
what
can
our
soul
have
in
common
with
that
of
an
elderly
spinster
a
ploughman
a
miser
who
worships
his
gold
can
any
connection
exist
between
such
as
these
and
a
feeling
a
boundless
love
for
humanity
an
interest
time
can
not
stale
but
let
a
balzac
step
forward
and
stand
in
the
midst
of
them
with
his
eyes
and
ears
on
the
watch
and
the
emotion
that
lived
and
died
in
an
country
parlour
shall
as
mightily
stir
our
heart
shall
as
unerringly
find
its
way
to
the
deepest
sources
of
life
as
the
majestic
passion
that
ruled
the
life
of
a
king
and
shed
its
triumphant
lustre
from
the
dazzling
height
of
a
throne
there
are
certain
little
agitations
says
balzac
in
the
cure
de
tours
the
most
admirable
of
all
his
studies
of
humble
life
there
are
certain
little
agitations
that
are
capable
of
generating
as
much
passion
within
the
soul
as
would
suffice
to
direct
the
most
important
social
interests
is
it
not
a
mistake
to
imagine
that
time
only
flies
swiftly
with
those
whose
hearts
are
devoured
by
mighty
schemes
which
fret
and
fever
their
life
not
an
hour
sped
past
the
abbe
troubert
but
was
as
animated
as
laden
with
its
burden
of
anxious
thought
as
lined
with
pleading
hope
and
deep
despair
as
could
be
the
most
desperate
hour
of
gambler
plotter
or
lover
god
alone
can
tell
how
much
energy
is
consumed
in
the
triumphs
we
achieve
over
men
and
things
and
ourselves
we
may
not
be
always
aware
whither
our
steps
are
leading
but
are
only
too
fully
conscious
of
the
wearisomeness
of
the
journey
and
yet
if
the
historian
may
be
permitted
to
lay
aside
for
one
moment
the
story
he
is
telling
and
to
assume
the
role
of
the
critic
as
you
cast
your
eyes
on
the
lives
of
these
old
maids
and
these
two
priests
seeking
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
sorrow
which
twisted
their
heartstrings
it
will
be
revealed
to
you
perhaps
that
certain
passions
must
be
experienced
by
man
for
there
to
develop
within
him
the
qualities
that
make
a
life
noble
that
widen
its
area
and
stifle
the
egoism
natural
to
all
he
speaks
truly
not
for
its
own
sake
always
should
we
love
the
light
but
for
the
sake
of
what
it
illumines
the
fire
on
the
mountain
shines
brightly
but
there
are
few
men
on
the
mountain
and
more
service
may
often
be
rendered
by
the
torchlight
there
where
the
crowd
is
it
is
in
the
humble
lives
that
is
found
the
substance
of
great
lives
and
by
watching
the
narrowest
feelings
does
enlargement
come
to
our
own
nor
is
this
from
any
repugnance
these
feelings
inspire
but
because
they
no
longer
accord
with
the
majestic
truth
that
controls
us
it
is
well
to
have
visions
of
a
better
life
than
that
of
every
day
but
it
is
the
life
of
every
day
from
which
elements
of
a
better
life
must
come
we
are
told
we
should
fix
our
eyes
on
high
far
above
life
but
perhaps
it
is
better
still
that
our
soul
should
look
straight
before
it
and
that
the
heights
whereupon
it
should
yearn
to
lay
all
its
hopes
and
its
dreams
should
be
the
mountain
peaks
that
stand
clearly
out
from
the
clouds
that
gild
the
horizon
this
brings
us
back
once
again
to
external
destiny
but
the
tears
that
external
suffering
wrings
from
us
are
not
the
only
tears
known
to
man
the
sage
whom
we
love
must
dwell
in
the
midst
of
all
human
passions
for
only
on
the
passions
known
to
the
heart
can
his
wisdom
safely
be
nourished
they
are
nature
artisans
sent
by
her
to
help
us
construct
the
palace
of
our
consciousness
of
our
happiness
in
other
words
and
he
who
rejects
these
workers
deeming
that
he
is
able
unaided
to
raise
all
the
stones
of
life
will
be
compelled
for
ever
to
lodge
his
soul
in
a
bare
and
gloomy
cell
the
wise
man
learns
to
purify
his
passions
to
stifle
them
can
never
be
proof
of
wisdom
and
indeed
these
things
are
all
governed
by
the
position
we
take
as
we
stand
on
the
stairs
of
time
to
some
of
us
moral
infirmities
are
so
many
stairs
tending
downwards
to
others
they
represent
steps
that
lead
us
on
high
the
wise
man
perchance
may
do
things
that
are
done
by
the
unwise
man
also
but
the
latter
is
forced
by
his
passions
to
become
the
abject
slave
of
his
instincts
whereas
the
sage
passions
will
end
by
illumining
much
that
was
vague
in
his
consciousness
to
love
madly
perhaps
is
not
wise
still
should
he
love
madly
more
wisdom
will
doubtless
come
to
him
than
if
he
had
always
loved
wisely
it
is
not
wisdom
but
the
most
useless
form
of
pride
that
can
flourish
in
vacancy
and
inertia
it
is
not
enough
to
know
what
should
be
done
not
though
we
can
unerringly
declare
what
saint
or
hero
would
do
such
things
a
book
can
teach
in
a
day
it
is
not
enough
to
intend
to
live
a
noble
life
and
then
retire
to
a
cell
there
to
brood
over
this
intention
no
wisdom
thus
acquired
can
truly
guide
or
beautify
the
soul
it
is
of
as
little
avail
as
the
counsels
that
others
can
offer
it
is
in
the
silence
that
follows
the
storm
says
a
hindu
proverb
and
not
in
the
silence
before
it
that
we
should
search
for
the
budding
flower
the
earnest
wayfarer
along
the
paths
of
life
does
but
become
the
more
deeply
convinced
as
his
travels
extend
of
the
beauty
the
wisdom
and
truth
of
the
simplest
and
humblest
laws
of
existence
their
uniformity
the
mere
fact
of
their
being
so
general
such
matter
of
every
day
are
in
themselves
enough
to
compel
his
admiration
and
little
by
little
he
holds
the
abnormal
ever
less
highly
and
neither
seeks
nor
desires
it
for
it
is
soon
borne
home
to
him
as
he
reflects
on
the
vastness
of
nature
with
her
slow
monotonous
movement
that
the
ridiculous
pretensions
our
ignorance
and
vanity
put
forth
are
the
most
truly
abnormal
of
all
he
no
longer
vexes
the
hours
as
they
pass
with
prayer
for
strange
or
marvellous
adventure
for
these
come
only
to
such
as
have
not
yet
learned
to
have
faith
in
life
and
themselves
he
no
longer
awaits
with
folded
arms
the
chance
for
superhuman
effort
for
he
feels
that
he
exists
in
every
act
that
is
human
he
no
longer
requires
that
death
or
friendship
or
love
should
come
to
him
decked
out
with
garlands
illusion
has
woven
or
escorted
by
omen
coincidence
presage
but
they
come
in
their
bareness
and
simpleness
and
are
always
sure
of
his
welcome
he
believes
that
all
that
the
weak
and
the
idle
and
thoughtless
consider
sublime
and
exceptional
that
the
fall
equivalent
for
the
most
heroic
deed
can
be
found
in
the
simple
life
that
is
bravely
and
wholly
faced
he
no
longer
considers
himself
the
chosen
son
of
the
universe
but
his
happiness
consciousness
peace
of
mind
have
gained
all
that
his
pride
has
lost
and
this
point
once
attained
then
will
the
miraculous
adventures
of
a
theresa
or
the
ecstasy
of
the
mystics
the
supernatural
incidents
of
legendary
loves
the
star
of
an
alexander
or
a
napoleon
then
will
all
these
seem
the
merest
childish
illusions
compared
with
the
healthy
wisdom
of
a
loyal
earnest
man
who
has
no
craving
to
soar
above
his
fellows
so
as
to
feel
what
they
can
not
feel
but
whose
heart
and
brain
find
the
light
that
they
need
in
the
unchanging
feelings
of
all
the
truest
man
will
never
be
he
who
desires
to
be
other
than
man
how
many
there
are
that
thus
waste
their
lives
scouring
the
heavens
for
sight
of
the
comet
that
never
will
come
but
disdaining
to
look
at
the
stars
because
these
can
be
seen
by
all
and
moreover
are
countless
in
number
this
craving
for
the
extraordinary
is
often
the
special
weakness
of
ordinary
men
who
fail
to
perceive
that
the
more
normal
and
ordinary
and
uniform
events
may
appear
to
us
the
more
are
we
able
to
appreciate
the
profound
happiness
that
this
uniformity
enfolds
and
the
nearer
are
we
drawn
to
the
truth
and
tranquillity
of
the
great
force
by
which
we
have
being
what
can
be
less
abnormal
than
the
ocean
which
covers
of
the
globe
and
yet
what
is
there
more
vast
there
is
not
a
thought
or
a
feeling
not
an
act
of
beauty
or
nobility
whereof
man
is
capable
but
can
find
complete
expression
in
the
simplest
most
ordinary
life
and
all
that
can
not
be
expressed
therein
must
of
necessity
belong
to
the
falsehoods
of
vanity
ignorance
or
sloth
does
this
mean
that
the
wise
man
should
expect
no
more
from
life
than
other
men
that
he
should
love
mediocrity
and
limit
his
desires
content
himself
with
little
and
restrict
the
horizon
of
his
happiness
because
of
the
fear
lest
happiness
escape
him
by
no
means
for
the
wisdom
is
halting
and
sickly
that
can
too
freely
renounce
a
legitimate
human
hope
many
desires
in
man
may
be
legitimate
still
notwithstanding
the
disapproval
of
reason
sometimes
unduly
severe
but
the
fact
that
our
happiness
does
not
seem
extraordinary
to
those
about
us
by
no
means
warrants
our
thinking
that
we
are
not
happy
the
wiser
we
are
the
more
readily
do
we
perceive
that
happiness
lies
in
our
grasp
that
it
has
no
more
enviable
gift
than
the
uneventful
moments
it
brings
the
sage
has
learnt
to
quicken
and
love
the
silent
substance
of
life
in
this
silent
substance
only
can
faithful
joys
be
found
for
abnormal
happiness
never
ventures
to
go
with
us
to
the
tomb
the
day
that
comes
and
goes
without
special
whisper
of
hope
or
happiness
should
be
as
dear
to
us
and
as
welcome
as
any
one
of
its
brothers
on
its
way
to
us
it
has
traversed
the
same
worlds
and
the
space
as
the
day
that
finds
us
on
a
throne
or
enthralled
by
a
mighty
love
the
hours
are
less
dazzling
perhaps
that
its
mantle
conceals
but
at
least
we
may
rely
more
fully
on
their
humble
devotion
there
are
as
many
eternal
minutes
in
the
week
that
goes
by
in
silence
as
in
the
one
that
tomes
boldly
towards
us
with
mighty
shout
and
clamour
and
indeed
it
is
we
who
tell
ourselves
all
that
the
hour
would
seem
to
say
for
the
hour
that
abides
with
us
is
ever
a
timid
and
nervous
guest
that
will
smile
if
its
host
be
smiling
or
weep
if
his
eyes
be
wet
it
has
been
charged
with
no
mission
to
bring
happiness
to
us
it
is
we
who
should
comfort
the
hour
that
has
sought
refuge
within
our
soul
and
he
is
wise
who
always
finds
words
of
peace
that
he
can
whisper
low
to
his
guest
on
the
threshold
we
should
let
no
opportunity
for
happiness
escape
us
and
the
simplest
causes
of
happiness
should
be
ever
stored
in
our
soul
it
is
well
at
first
to
know
happiness
as
men
conceive
it
so
that
later
we
may
have
good
reason
for
preferring
the
happiness
of
our
choice
for
herein
it
is
not
unlike
what
we
are
told
of
love
to
know
what
real
love
should
be
we
must
have
loved
profoundly
and
that
first
love
must
have
fled
it
is
well
to
know
moments
of
material
happiness
since
they
teach
us
where
to
look
for
loftier
joys
and
all
that
we
gain
perhaps
from
listening
to
the
hours
that
babble
aloud
in
their
wantonness
is
that
we
are
slowly
learning
the
language
of
the
hours
whose
voice
is
hushed
and
of
these
there
are
many
they
come
in
battalions
so
close
on
the
heels
of
each
other
that
treachery
and
flight
can
not
be
wherefore
it
is
on
them
alone
that
the
sage
should
depend
for
he
will
be
happy
whose
eyes
have
learned
to
detect
the
hidden
smile
and
mysterious
jewels
of
the
myriad
nameless
hours
and
where
are
these
jewels
to
be
found
if
not
in
ourselves
but
there
is
a
kind
of
ignoble
discretion
that
has
least
in
common
of
all
things
with
the
wisdom
we
speak
of
here
for
we
had
far
better
spend
our
energy
round
even
fruitless
happiness
than
slumber
by
the
fireside
awaiting
joys
that
never
may
come
only
the
joys
that
have
been
offered
to
all
and
none
have
accepted
will
knock
at
his
door
who
refuses
himself
to
stir
forth
nor
is
the
other
man
wise
who
holds
the
reins
too
tight
on
his
feelings
and
halts
them
when
reason
commands
or
experience
whispers
the
friend
is
not
wise
who
will
not
confide
in
his
friend
remembering
always
that
friendships
may
come
to
an
end
nor
the
lover
who
draws
back
for
fear
lest
he
may
find
shipwreck
in
love
for
here
were
we
twenty
times
unfortunate
it
is
still
only
the
perishable
portion
of
our
energy
for
happiness
that
suffers
and
what
is
wisdom
after
all
but
this
same
energy
for
happiness
cleansed
of
all
that
is
impure
to
be
wise
we
must
first
learn
to
be
happy
that
we
may
attach
ever
smaller
importance
to
what
happiness
may
be
in
itself
we
should
be
as
happy
as
possible
and
our
happiness
should
last
as
long
as
is
possible
for
those
who
can
finally
issue
forth
from
self
by
the
portal
of
happiness
know
infinitely
wider
freedom
than
those
who
pass
through
the
gate
of
sadness
the
joy
of
the
sage
illumines
his
heart
and
his
soul
alike
whereas
sadness
most
often
throws
light
on
the
heart
alone
one
might
almost
compare
the
man
who
had
never
been
happy
with
a
traveller
whose
every
journey
had
been
taken
by
night
moreover
there
is
in
happiness
a
humility
deeper
and
nobler
purer
and
wider
than
sorrow
can
ever
procure
there
is
a
certain
humility
that
ranks
with
parasitic
virtues
such
as
sterile
arbitrary
chastity
blind
submission
fanatic
renouncement
penitence
false
shame
and
many
others
which
have
from
time
immemorial
turned
aside
from
their
course
the
waters
of
human
morality
and
forced
them
into
a
stagnant
pool
around
which
our
memory
still
lingers
nor
do
i
speak
of
a
cunning
humility
that
is
often
mere
calculation
or
taken
at
its
best
a
timidity
that
has
its
root
in
pride
a
loan
at
usury
that
our
vanity
of
extends
to
our
vanity
of
and
even
the
sage
at
times
conceives
it
well
to
lower
himself
in
his
own
and
to
deny
superior
merits
that
are
his
when
comparing
himself
with
other
men
humility
of
this
kind
may
throw
a
charm
around
our
ways
of
life
but
yet
sincere
as
it
doubtless
may
be
it
nevertheless
attacks
the
loyalty
due
to
ourselves
which
we
should
value
high
above
all
and
it
surely
implies
a
certain
timidity
of
conscience
whereas
the
conscience
of
the
sage
should
harbour
neither
timidity
nor
shame
but
by
the
side
of
this
too
personal
humility
there
exists
another
humility
that
extends
to
all
things
that
is
lofty
and
strong
that
has
fed
on
all
that
is
best
in
our
brain
and
our
heart
and
our
soul
it
is
a
humility
that
defines
the
limit
of
the
hopes
and
adventures
of
men
that
lessens
us
only
to
add
to
the
grandeur
of
all
we
behold
that
teaches
us
where
we
should
look
for
the
true
importance
of
man
which
lies
not
in
that
which
he
is
but
in
that
which
his
eyes
can
take
in
which
he
strives
to
accept
and
to
grasp
it
is
true
that
sorrow
will
also
bring
us
to
the
realm
of
this
humility
but
it
hastens
us
through
branching
off
on
the
road
to
a
mysterious
gate
of
hope
on
whose
threshold
we
lose
many
days
whereas
happiness
that
after
the
first
few
hours
has
nothing
else
left
to
do
will
lead
us
in
silence
through
path
after
path
till
we
reach
the
most
unforeseen
inaccessible
places
of
all
it
is
when
the
sage
knows
he
possesses
at
last
all
man
is
allowed
to
possess
that
he
begins
to
perceive
that
it
is
his
manner
of
regarding
what
man
may
never
possess
that
determines
the
value
of
such
things
as
he
truly
may
call
his
own
and
therefore
must
we
long
have
sunned
ourselves
in
the
rays
of
happiness
before
we
can
truly
conceive
an
independent
view
of
life
we
must
be
happy
not
for
happiness
sake
but
so
that
we
may
learn
to
see
distinctly
that
which
vain
expectation
of
happiness
would
for
ever
hide
from
our
gaze
economy
avails
us
nothing
in
the
region
of
the
heart
for
it
is
there
that
men
gather
the
harvest
of
life
very
substance
it
were
better
that
nothing
were
done
there
than
that
things
should
be
done
by
halves
and
that
which
we
have
not
dared
to
risk
is
most
surely
lost
of
all
to
limit
our
passions
is
only
to
limit
ourselves
and
we
are
the
losers
by
just
so
much
as
we
hoped
to
gain
there
are
certain
fastnesses
within
our
soul
that
lie
buried
so
deep
that
love
alone
dare
venture
down
and
it
returns
laden
with
jewels
whose
lustre
can
only
be
seen
as
they
pass
from
our
open
hand
to
the
hand
of
one
we
love
and
indeed
it
would
seem
that
so
clear
a
light
springs
from
our
hands
as
they
open
thus
to
give
that
it
penetrates
substance
too
opaque
to
yield
to
the
mysterious
rays
just
discovered
it
avails
us
nothing
unduly
to
bemoan
our
errors
or
losses
for
happen
what
may
to
the
man
of
simple
faith
still
at
the
last
minute
of
the
hour
at
the
end
of
the
week
or
year
still
will
he
find
some
cause
for
gladness
as
he
turns
his
eyes
within
little
by
little
he
has
learned
to
regret
without
tears
he
is
as
a
father
might
be
who
returns
to
his
home
in
the
evening
his
day
work
done
he
may
find
his
children
in
tears
perhaps
or
playing
dangerous
forbidden
games
the
furniture
scattered
glasses
broken
a
lamp
overturned
but
shall
he
therefore
despair
it
would
certainly
have
been
better
had
the
children
been
more
obedient
had
they
quietly
learned
their
lessons
would
have
been
more
in
keeping
with
every
moral
theory
but
how
unreasonable
the
father
who
in
the
midst
of
his
harsh
rebuke
could
withhold
a
smile
as
he
turned
his
head
away
the
children
have
acted
unwisely
perhaps
in
their
exuberance
of
life
but
why
should
this
distress
him
all
is
well
so
long
as
he
return
home
at
night
so
long
as
he
ever
keep
about
him
the
key
of
the
guardian
dwelling
as
we
look
into
ourselves
and
pass
in
review
what
our
heart
and
brain
and
soul
have
attempted
and
carried
through
while
we
were
away
the
benefit
lies
far
more
in
the
searching
glance
itself
than
in
the
actual
inspection
and
if
the
hours
have
not
once
let
fall
their
mysterious
girdle
on
their
way
past
our
threshold
if
the
rooms
be
as
empty
as
on
the
day
of
departure
and
those
within
have
but
sat
with
folded
arms
and
worked
not
at
all
as
we
enter
shall
something
be
learned
from
our
echoing
footsteps
of
the
extent
and
the
clearness
and
the
fidelity
of
our
home
no
day
can
be
uneventful
save
in
ourselves
alone
but
in
the
day
that
seems
most
uneventful
of
all
there
is
still
room
for
the
loftiest
destiny
for
there
is
far
more
scope
for
such
destiny
within
ourselves
than
on
the
whole
continent
of
europe
not
by
the
extent
of
empire
is
the
range
of
destiny
governed
but
indeed
by
the
depth
of
our
soul
it
is
in
our
conception
of
life
that
real
destiny
is
found
when
at
last
there
is
delicate
balance
between
the
insoluble
questions
of
heaven
and
the
wavering
response
of
our
soul
and
these
questions
become
the
more
tranquil
as
they
seem
to
comprise
more
and
more
and
to
the
sage
whatever
may
happen
will
still
widen
the
scope
of
the
questions
still
give
deeper
confidence
to
the
reply
speak
not
of
destiny
when
the
event
that
has
brought
you
joy
or
sadness
has
still
altered
nothing
in
your
manner
of
regarding
the
universe
all
that
remains
to
us
when
love
and
glory
are
over
when
adventures
and
passions
have
faded
into
the
past
is
but
a
deeper
and
sense
of
the
infinite
and
if
we
have
not
that
within
us
then
are
we
destitute
indeed
and
this
sense
of
the
infinite
is
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
thoughts
which
indeed
are
but
the
innumerable
steps
that
thither
lead
there
is
no
happiness
in
happiness
itself
unless
it
help
our
comprehension
of
the
rest
unless
it
help
us
in
some
measure
to
conceive
that
the
very
universe
itself
must
rejoice
in
existence
the
sage
who
has
attained
a
certain
height
will
find
peace
in
all
things
that
happen
and
the
event
that
saddens
him
as
other
men
tarries
but
an
instant
ere
it
goes
to
strengthen
his
deep
perception
of
life
he
who
has
learned
to
see
in
all
things
only
matter
for
unselfish
wonder
can
be
deprived
of
no
satisfaction
whatever
without
there
spring
to
sudden
life
within
him
from
the
mere
feeling
that
this
joy
can
be
dispensed
with
a
high
protecting
thought
that
enfolds
him
in
its
light
that
destiny
is
beautiful
wherein
each
event
though
charged
with
joy
or
sadness
has
brought
reflection
to
us
has
added
something
to
our
range
of
soul
has
given
us
greater
peace
wherewith
to
cling
to
life
and
indeed
the
accident
that
robs
us
of
our
love
that
leads
us
along
in
triumph
or
even
that
seats
us
on
a
throne
reveals
but
little
of
the
workings
of
destiny
which
indeed
lie
far
more
in
the
thoughts
that
arise
in
our
mind
as
we
look
at
the
men
around
us
at
the
woman
we
love
as
we
dwell
on
the
feelings
within
us
as
we
fix
our
eyes
on
the
evening
sky
with
its
crown
of
indifferent
stars
a
woman
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
talent
possessed
of
the
rarest
qualities
of
mind
and
soul
was
one
day
asked
by
a
friend
to
whom
she
seemed
the
most
perfect
creature
on
earth
what
are
your
plans
can
any
man
be
worthy
of
your
love
your
future
puzzles
me
i
can
not
conceive
a
destiny
that
shall
be
lofty
enough
for
a
soul
such
as
yours
he
knew
but
little
of
destiny
to
him
as
to
most
men
it
meant
thrones
triumphs
dazzling
adventures
these
things
seemed
to
him
the
sum
of
a
human
destiny
whereby
he
did
but
prove
that
he
knew
not
what
destiny
was
and
in
the
first
place
why
this
disdain
of
to
disdain
is
to
prove
that
yesterday
has
been
misunderstood
to
disdain
is
to
declare
oneself
a
stranger
and
what
can
you
hope
to
do
in
a
world
where
you
shall
ever
pass
as
a
stranger
has
this
advantage
over
yesterday
that
it
exists
and
was
made
for
us
be
what
it
will
it
has
wider
knowledge
than
yesterday
and
by
that
alone
does
it
become
more
beautiful
and
vaster
why
should
we
think
that
the
woman
i
speak
of
would
have
known
a
more
brilliant
destiny
in
venice
florence
or
rome
her
presence
might
have
been
sought
at
magnificent
festival
and
her
beauty
have
found
a
fitting
surrounding
in
exquisite
landscape
she
might
have
had
princes
and
kings
the
elect
of
the
world
at
her
feet
and
perhaps
it
had
needed
but
one
of
her
smiles
to
add
to
a
great
nation
gladness
to
ennoble
or
chasten
the
thought
of
an
epoch
whereas
here
all
her
life
will
be
spent
among
four
or
five
people
four
or
five
souls
that
know
of
her
soul
and
love
her
it
may
be
that
she
never
shall
stir
from
her
dwelling
that
of
her
life
of
her
thoughts
and
the
strength
that
is
in
her
there
will
remain
not
a
trace
among
men
it
may
be
that
her
beauty
her
force
and
her
instinct
for
good
will
be
buried
within
her
in
her
heart
and
the
hearts
of
the
few
who
are
near
and
even
then
and
if
this
be
so
the
soul
of
this
woman
doubtless
shall
find
its
own
thing
to
do
the
mighty
gates
through
which
we
must
pass
to
a
helpful
and
noteworthy
life
no
longer
grate
on
their
hinges
with
the
deafening
clamour
of
old
they
are
smaller
perhaps
than
they
were
less
vast
and
imposing
but
their
number
is
greater
and
they
admit
us
in
silence
to
paths
that
extend
very
far
and
even
though
the
home
of
this
woman
be
not
brightened
by
one
single
gleam
from
without
will
she
have
failed
to
fulfil
her
destiny
because
her
life
is
lived
in
the
shade
can
not
destiny
be
beautiful
and
complete
in
itself
without
help
from
without
as
the
soul
that
has
truly
conquered
surveys
the
triumphs
of
the
past
it
is
glad
of
those
only
that
brought
with
them
a
deeper
knowledge
of
life
and
a
nobler
humility
of
those
that
lent
sweeter
charm
to
the
moments
when
love
glory
and
enthusiasm
having
faded
away
the
fruit
that
a
few
hours
of
boiling
passion
had
ripened
was
gathered
in
meditation
and
silence
when
the
feasting
is
over
when
charity
kindness
and
valorous
deed
all
lie
far
behind
us
what
is
there
left
to
the
soul
but
some
stray
recollections
a
gain
of
some
consciousness
and
a
feeling
that
helps
us
to
look
on
our
place
in
the
world
with
more
knowledge
and
less
apprehension
a
feeling
blent
with
some
wisdom
from
the
numberless
things
it
has
learned
when
the
hour
for
rest
has
sounded
as
it
must
sound
every
night
and
at
every
moment
of
solitude
when
the
gaudy
vestments
of
love
and
glory
and
power
fall
helplessly
round
us
what
is
it
we
can
take
with
us
as
we
seek
refuge
within
ourselves
where
the
happiness
of
each
day
is
measured
by
the
knowledge
the
day
has
brought
us
by
the
thoughts
and
the
confidence
it
has
helped
us
to
acquire
is
our
true
destiny
to
be
found
in
the
things
which
take
place
about
us
or
in
that
which
abides
in
our
soul
be
a
man
power
or
glory
never
so
great
said
a
philosopher
his
soul
soon
learns
how
to
value
the
feelings
that
spring
from
external
events
and
as
he
perceives
that
no
increase
has
come
to
his
physical
faculties
that
these
remain
wholly
unchanged
neither
altered
nor
added
to
then
does
the
sense
of
his
nothingness
burst
full
upon
him
the
king
who
should
govern
the
world
must
still
like
the
rest
of
his
brothers
revolve
in
a
limited
circle
whose
every
law
must
be
obeyed
and
on
his
impressions
and
thoughts
must
his
happiness
wholly
depend
the
impressions
his
memory
retains
we
might
add
because
they
have
chastened
his
mind
for
the
souls
that
we
deal
with
here
will
retain
such
impressions
only
as
have
quickened
their
sense
of
goodness
as
have
made
them
a
little
more
noble
is
it
impossible
to
find
it
matters
not
where
nor
how
great
be
the
silence
the
same
undlssolvable
matter
that
lurks
in
the
cup
of
the
noblest
external
existence
and
seeing
that
nothing
is
truly
our
own
till
it
faithfully
follow
us
into
the
darkness
and
silence
why
should
the
thing
that
has
sprung
to
life
there
be
less
faithful
in
silence
and
darkness
but
we
will
pursue
this
no
farther
for
it
leads
to
a
wisdom
of
theory
for
all
that
a
brilliant
exterior
destiny
is
not
indispensable
still
should
we
always
regard
it
as
wholly
desirable
and
pursue
it
as
keenly
as
though
we
valued
it
highly
it
behoves
the
sage
to
knock
at
the
door
of
every
temple
of
glory
of
every
dwelling
where
happiness
love
and
activity
are
to
be
found
and
if
his
strenuous
effort
and
long
expectation
remain
unrewarded
if
no
door
fly
open
still
may
he
find
perhaps
in
the
mere
expectation
and
effort
an
equivalent
for
all
the
emotions
and
light
that
he
sought
to
act
says
barres
is
to
annex
to
our
thoughts
vaster
fields
of
experience
it
is
also
perhaps
to
think
more
quickly
than
thought
as
more
completely
for
we
no
longer
think
with
the
brain
alone
but
with
every
atom
of
life
it
is
to
wrap
round
with
dream
the
profoundest
sources
of
thought
and
then
to
confront
them
with
fact
but
to
act
is
not
always
to
conquer
to
attempt
to
be
patient
and
wait
these
too
may
be
action
as
also
to
hear
to
watch
and
be
silent
if
the
lot
of
the
woman
we
speak
of
had
been
cast
in
athens
or
florence
or
rome
there
had
been
in
her
life
certain
motives
of
grandeur
occasions
for
beauty
and
happiness
that
she
may
well
never
meet
with
and
she
is
the
poorer
for
lacking
the
efforts
she
might
have
put
forth
the
memory
of
what
might
have
been
done
for
in
these
lies
a
force
that
is
precious
and
vital
that
often
indeed
will
transform
many
more
things
within
us
than
a
thought
which
is
morally
mentally
worth
many
thousand
such
efforts
and
memories
and
indeed
it
is
therefore
alone
that
we
should
desire
a
brilliant
feverish
destiny
because
it
summons
to
life
certain
forces
and
feelings
that
would
otherwise
never
emerge
from
the
slumberous
peace
of
an
existence
but
from
the
moment
we
know
or
even
suspect
that
these
feelings
lie
dormant
within
us
we
are
already
giving
life
to
all
that
is
best
in
those
feelings
and
it
is
as
though
we
were
for
one
brief
moment
looking
down
upon
a
glorious
external
destiny
from
heights
such
destiny
shall
only
attain
at
the
end
of
its
days
as
though
we
were
prematurely
gathering
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
it
shall
itself
still
find
barren
until
many
a
storm
has
passed
last
night
with
whom
we
seem
to
ascend
a
lofty
tower
whence
our
gaze
rests
on
hundreds
of
human
destinies
astir
in
the
valley
below
i
understood
what
a
beautiful
destiny
meant
to
the
instinct
of
man
it
would
doubtless
have
puzzled
himself
to
have
told
what
it
was
that
he
loved
and
admired
in
some
of
his
heroes
whom
he
enwraps
in
a
sort
of
resigned
and
almost
unconscious
respect
thousands
of
virtues
that
he
esteemed
highly
have
ceased
to
exist
and
many
a
quality
now
seems
petty
indeed
that
he
commended
in
some
of
his
great
ones
and
yet
are
there
unperceived
as
it
were
by
him
four
or
five
men
in
the
midst
of
the
glittering
crowd
hard
by
the
monarch
throne
four
or
five
earnest
benevolent
faces
on
whom
our
eye
still
rests
gladly
though
gives
them
no
special
attention
or
thought
for
in
his
heart
he
looks
with
disfavour
on
the
ideas
that
govern
their
life
fenelon

there
the
dukes
of
chevreuse
and
beauvilliers
there
is
monsieur
le
dauphin
their
happiness
is
no
greater
than
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
they
achieve
no
marked
success
they
gain
no
resplendent
victory
they
live
as
the
others
live
in
the
fret
and
expectation
of
the
thing
that
we
choose
to
call
happiness
because
it
has
yet
to
come
fenelon
incurs
the
displeasure
of
the
crafty
bigoted
king
who
for
all
his
pride
would
resent
the
most
trivial
offence
with
the
humbleness
of
humblest
vanity
who
was
great
in
small
things
and
petty
in
all
that
was
great
for
such
was
louis
xiv
fenelon
is
condemned
persecuted
exiled
the
dukes
of
chevreuse
and
beauvilliers
continue
to
hold
important
office
at
court
but
none
the
less
deem
it
prudent
to
live
in
a
kind
of
voluntary
retirement
the
dauphin
is
not
in
favour
with
the
king
a
powerful
envious
clique
are
for
ever
intriguing
against
him
and
they
finally
succeed
in
crushing
his
youthful
military
glory
he
lives
in
the
midst
of
disgrace
misadventure
disaster
that
seem
irreparable
in
the
eyes
of
that
vain
and
servile
court
for
disgrace
and
disaster
assume
the
proportions
the
manners
of
the
day
accord
finally
he
dies
a
few
days
after
the
death
of
the
wife
he
had
loved
so
tenderly
he
dies
poisoned
perhaps
as
she
too
the
thunderbolt
falling
just
as
the
very
first
rays
of
kingly
favour
whereon
he
had
almost
ceased
to
count
were
stealing
over
his
threshold
such
were
the
troubles
and
misfortunes
the
sorrows
and
disappointments
that
wrapped
these
lives
round
and
yet
as
we
look
on
this
little
group
standing
firm
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
feverish
intermittent
glitter
of
the
rest
then
do
these
four
destinies
seem
truly
beautiful
to
us
and
enviable
through
all
their
vicissitudes
one
common
light
shines
through
them
the
great
soul
of
fenelon
illumines
them
all
fenelon
is
faithful
to
his
loftiest
thoughts
of
piety
meekness
wonder
justice
and
love
and
the
other
three
are
faithful
to
him
who
was
their
master
and
friend
and
what
though
the
mystic
ideas
of
fenelon
be
no
longer
shared
by
us
what
though
the
ideas
that
we
cling
to
ourselves
and
deem
the
profoundest
and
noblest
the
ideas
that
live
at
the
root
of
our
every
conviction
of
life
that
have
served
as
the
basis
of
all
our
moral
happiness
what
though
these
should
one
day
fall
in
ruins
behind
us
and
only
arouse
a
smile
among
such
as
believe
that
they
have
found
other
thoughts
still
which
to
them
seem
more
human
and
final
thought
of
itself
is
possessed
of
no
vital
importance
it
is
the
feelings
awakened
within
us
by
thought
that
ennoble
and
brighten
our
life
thought
is
our
aim
perhaps
but
it
may
be
with
this
as
with
many
a
journey
we
take
the
place
we
are
bound
for
may
interest
us
less
than
the
journey
itself
the
people
we
meet
on
the
road
the
unforeseen
that
may
happen
here
as
everywhere
it
is
only
the
sincerity
of
human
feeling
that
abides
as
for
a
thought
we
know
not
it
may
be
deceptive
but
the
love
wherewith
we
have
loved
it
will
surely
return
to
our
soul
nor
can
a
single
drop
of
its
clearness
or
strength
be
abstracted
by
error
of
that
perfect
ideal
that
each
of
us
strives
to
build
up
in
himself
the
sum
total
of
all
our
thoughts
will
help
only
to
model
the
outline
but
the
elements
that
go
to
construct
it
and
keep
it
alive
are
the
purified
passion
unselfishness
loyalty
wherein
these
thoughts
have
had
being
the
extent
of
our
love
for
the
thing
which
we
hold
to
be
true
is
of
greater
importance
than
even
the
truth
itself
does
not
love
bring
more
goodness
to
us
than
thought
can
ever
convey
loyally
to
love
a
great
error
may
well
be
more
helpful
than
meanly
to
serve
a
great
truth
for
in
doubt
no
less
than
in
faith
are
passion
and
love
to
be
found
some
doubts
are
as
generous
and
passionate
as
the
very
noblest
convictions
be
a
thought
of
the
loftiest
surest
or
of
the
most
profoundly
uncertain
the
best
that
it
has
to
offer
is
still
the
chance
that
it
gives
us
of
loving
some
one
thing
wholly
without
reserve
whether
it
be
to
man
or
a
god
to
country
to
world
or
to
error
that
i
truly
do
yield
myself
up
the
precious
ore
that
shall
some
day
be
found
buried
deep
in
the
ashes
of
love
will
have
sprung
from
the
love
itself
and
not
from
the
thing
that
i
loved
the
sincerity
of
an
attachment
its
simplicity
firmness
and
zeal
these
leave
a
track
behind
them
that
time
can
never
efface
all
passes
away
and
changes
it
may
be
that
all
is
lost
save
only
the
glow
of
this
ardour
fertility
and
strength
of
our
heart
never
did
man
possess
his
soul
in
such
peace
as
he
says
of
one
of
them
who
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
malice
and
scheming
and
snares
and
further
on
he
speaks
of
the
wise
tranquillity
of
another
and
this
wise
tranquillity
pervades
every
one
of
those
whom
he
terms
the
little
flock
the
little
flock
truly
of
fidelity
to
all
that
was
noblest
in
thought
the
little
flock
of
friendship
loyalty
and
inner
contentment
that
pass
along
radiant
with
peace
and
simplicity
in
the
midst
of
the
lies
and
ambitions
the
follies
and
treacheries
of
versailles
they
are
not
saints
in
the
vulgar
sense
of
the
word
they
have
not
fled
to
the
depths
of
forest
or
desert
or
sought
egotistic
shelter
in
narrow
cells
they
are
sages
who
remain
within
life
and
the
things
that
are
real
it
is
not
their
piety
that
saves
them
it
is
not
in
god
alone
that
their
soul
has
found
strength
to
love
god
and
to
serve
him
with
all
one
might
will
not
suffice
to
bring
peace
and
strength
to
the
soul
of
man
it
is
only
by
means
of
the
knowledge
and
thought
we
have
gained
and
developed
by
contact
with
men
that
we
can
learn
how
god
should
be
loved
for
notwithstanding
all
things
the
human
soul
remains
profoundly
human
still
it
may
be
taught
to
cherish
the
invisible
but
it
will
ever
find
far
more
actual
nourishment
in
the
virtue
or
feeling
that
is
simply
and
wholly
human
than
in
the
virtue
or
passion
divine
if
there
come
towards
us
a
man
whose
soul
is
truly
tranquil
and
calm
we
may
be
certain
that
human
virtues
have
given
him
his
tranquillity
and
his
calmness
were
we
permitted
to
peer
into
the
secret
recesses
of
hearts
that
are
now
no
more
we
might
discover
perhaps
that
the
fountain
of
peace
whereat
fenelon
slaked
his
thirst
every
night
of
his
exile
lay
rather
in
his
loyalty
to
madame
guyon
in
her
misfortune
in
his
love
for
the
slandered
persecuted
dauphin
than
in
his
expectation
of
eternal
reward
rather
in
the
irreproachable
human
conscience
within
him
overflowing
with
fidelity
and
tenderness
than
in
the
hopes
he
cherished
as
a
christian
admirable
indeed
is
the
serenity
of
this
little
flock
no
virtue
here
to
kindle
dazzling
fires
on
the
mountain
but
heart
and
soul
that
are
alive
with
flame
no
heroism
but
that
of
love
of
confidence
and
sincerity
that
remember
and
are
content
to
wait
some
men
there
are
whose
virtue
issues
from
them
with
a
noise
of
clanging
gates
in
others
it
dwells
as
silent
as
the
maid
who
never
stirs
from
home
who
sits
thoughtfully
by
the
fireside
always
ready
to
welcome
those
who
enter
from
the
cold
without
there
is
less
need
of
heroic
hours
perhaps
in
a
beautiful
life
than
of
weeks
that
are
grave
and
uniform
and
pure
it
may
be
that
the
soul
that
is
loyal
and
perfectly
just
is
more
precious
than
the
one
that
is
tender
or
full
of
devotion
it
will
enter
less
wholly
perhaps
and
with
less
exaltation
into
the
more
exuberant
adventures
of
life
but
in
the
events
that
occur
every
day
we
can
trust
it
more
fully
rely
more
completely
upon
it
and
is
there
a
man
after
all
no
matter
how
strange
and
delirious
and
brilliant
his
life
may
have
been
who
has
not
spent
the
great
bulk
of
his
time
in
the
midst
of
most
ordinary
incident
in
our
very
sublimest
hour
as
we
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
dazzling
circles
it
throws
are
we
not
startled
to
find
that
the
habits
and
thoughts
of
our
soberest
hour
are
whirling
around
with
the
rest
we
must
always
come
back
to
our
normal
life
that
is
built
on
the
solid
earth
and
primitive
rock
we
are
not
called
upon
to
contest
each
day
with
dishonour
despair
or
death
but
it
is
imperative
perhaps
that
i
should
be
able
to
tell
myself
at
every
hour
of
sadness
that
there
exists
somewhere
an
unchangeable
unconquerable
soul
that
has
drawn
near
to
my
soul
a
soul
that
is
faithful
and
silent
blind
to
all
that
it
deems
not
conformable
with
the
truth
we
can
only
have
praise
for
heroism
and
for
surpassingly
generous
deeds
but
more
praise
still
as
it
demands
a
more
vigilant
strength
for
the
man
who
never
allows
an
inferior
thought
to
seduce
him
who
leads
a
less
glorious
life
perhaps
but
one
of
more
uniform
worth
let
us
sometimes
in
our
meditations
bring
our
desire
for
moral
perfection
to
the
level
of
daily
truth
and
be
taught
how
far
easier
it
is
to
confer
occasional
benefit
than
never
to
do
any
harm
to
bring
occasional
happiness
than
never
be
cause
of
tears
their
refuge
their
firm
rock
as
calls
it
lay
in
each
other
and
above
all
in
themselves
and
all
that
was
blameless
within
their
soul
became
steadfastness
in
the
rock
a
thousand
substances
go
to
form
the
foundations
of
this
firm
rock
but
all
that
we
hold
to
be
blameless
within
us
will
sink
to
its
centre
and
base
it
is
true
that
our
standard
of
conduct
may
often
be
sadly
at
fault
and
the
vilest
of
men
has
a
moment
each
night
when
he
proudly
surveys
some
detestable
thought
that
seems
wholly
blameless
to
him
but
i
speak
of
a
virtue
here
that
is
higher
than
everyday
virtue
and
the
most
ordinary
man
is
aware
what
a
virtue
becomes
when
it
is
ordinary
virtue
no
longer
moral
beauty
indeed
though
it
be
of
the
rarest
kind
never
passes
the
comprehension
of
the
most
of
men
and
no
act
is
so
readily
understood
as
the
act
that
is
truly
sublime
we
may
admire
a
deed
profoundly
perhaps
and
yet
not
rise
to
its
height
but
it
is
imperative
that
we
should
not
abide
in
the
darkness
that
covers
the
thing
we
blame
many
a
happiness
in
life
as
many
a
disaster
is
due
to
chance
alone
but
the
peace
within
us
can
never
be
governed
by
chance
some
souls
i
know
for
ever
are
building
others
have
preference
for
ruins
and
others
still
will
wander
their
whole
life
through
seeking
shelter
beneath
strange
roofs
and
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
transform
the
instincts
that
dwell
in
the
soul
it
is
well
that
those
who
build
not
should
be
made
aware
of
the
joy
that
the
others
experience
as
they
incessantly
pile
stone
upon
stone
their
thoughts
and
attachments
and
love
their
convictions
deceptions
and
even
their
doubts
all
stand
in
good
service
and
when
the
passing
storm
has
demolished
their
mansion
they
build
once
again
with
the
ruins
a
little
distance
away
something
less
stately
perhaps
but
better
adapted
to
all
the
requirements
of
life
what
regret
disillusion
or
sadness
can
shatter
the
homestead
of
him
who
in
choosing
the
stones
for
his
dwelling
was
careful
to
keep
all
the
wisdom
and
strength
that
regret
disillusion
and
sadness
contain
or
might
we
not
say
that
it
is
with
the
roots
of
the
happiness
we
cherish
within
as
with
roots
of
great
trees
the
oaks
that
are
subject
the
most
to
the
stress
of
the
storm
thrust
their
roots
the
most
staunchly
and
firmly
deep
down
in
eternal
soil
and
the
fate
that
unjustly
pursues
us
is
no
more
aware
of
what
comes
to
pass
in
our
soul
than
the
wind
is
aware
of
what
happens
below
in
the
earth
here
let
us
note
how
great
is
the
power
how
mysterious
the
attraction
of
veritable
happiness
something
of
a
hush
comes
over
stirring
narrative
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
little
flock
passes
through
the
careless
triumphant
crowd
unceasingly
busy
with
intrigue
and
salutation
petty
love
and
petty
triumph
amidst
the
marble
staircases
and
magnificent
halls
of
versailles
goes
calmly
on
with
his
story
but
for
one
second
we
seem
to
have
compared
all
this
jubilant
vanity
and
ephemeral
rejoicing
this
falsehood
that
secretly
trembles
with
the
serene
unvarying
loftiness
of
those
strenuous
tranquil
souls
it
is
as
though
there
should
suddenly
appear
in
the
midst
of
a
band
of
children
who
are
plucking
flowers
it
may
be
stealing
fruit
or
playing
forbidden
games
a
priest
or
an
aged
man
who
should
go
on
his
way
letting
fall
not
one
word
of
rebuke
the
games
are
suddenly
stopped
startled
conscience
awakens
and
unbidden
thoughts
of
duty
reality
truth
rush
in
on
the
mind
but
with
men
no
more
than
with
children
are
impressions
of
long
duration
though
they
spring
from
the
priest
or
the
sage
or
only
the
thought
that
has
passed
and
gone
on
its
way
but
it
matters
not
they
have
seen
and
the
human
soul
for
all
that
the
eyes
are
only
too
willing
to
close
or
turn
away
is
nobler
than
most
men
would
wish
it
to
be
for
it
often
troubles
their
peace
and
the
soul
is
quick
to
declare
its
preference
for
that
it
has
seen
and
fain
would
abandon
its
enforced
and
wearisome
idleness
and
although
we
may
smile
and
make
merry
as
the
sage
disappears
in
the
distance
he
has
though
he
know
it
not
left
a
clear
track
in
the
midst
of
our
error
and
folly
where
haply
it
still
will
abide
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
when
the
sudden
hour
of
tears
bursts
upon
us
then
most
of
all
shall
we
see
it
enwrapped
in
light
we
find
again
and
again
in
story
that
sorrow
no
sooner
invades
a
soul
somewhat
loftier
than
others
somewhat
nearer
to
life
perhaps
than
it
speedily
flies
for
comfort
to
one
it
has
thus
seen
pass
by
in
the
midst
of
the
uneasy
silence
and
almost
malevolent
wonder
that
in
this
world
too
often
attend
the
footsteps
of
a
blameless
life
it
is
not
our
wont
to
question
happiness
closely
in
the
days
when
we
deem
ourselves
happy
but
when
sorrow
draws
nigh
our
memory
flies
to
the
peace
that
somewhere
lies
hidden
the
peace
that
depends
not
on
the
rays
of
the
sun
or
the
kiss
that
has
been
withheld
or
the
disapproval
of
kings
at
such
moments
we
go
not
to
those
who
are
happy
as
we
once
were
happy
for
we
know
that
this
happiness
melts
away
before
the
first
fretful
gesture
of
fate
would
you
learn
where
true
happiness
dwells
you
have
only
to
watch
the
movements
of
those
who
are
wretched
and
seek
consolation
sorrow
is
like
the
that
used
to
avail
the
seekers
of
treasure
or
of
clear
running
water
for
he
who
may
have
it
about
him
unerringly
makes
for
the
house
where
profoundest
peace
has
its
home
and
this
is
so
true
that
we
should
be
wise
perhaps
not
to
dwell
with
too
much
satisfaction
on
our
own
peace
of
mind
and
tranquillity
on
the
sincerity
of
our
own
acquiescence
in
the
great
laws
of
life
or
rely
too
complacently
on
the
duration
of
our
own
happiness
until
such
time
as
the
instinct
of
those
who
suffer
impels
them
to
knock
at
our
door
and
their
eyes
can
behold
shining
bright
on
the
threshold
the
steady
unwavering
flame
of
the
lamp
that
burns
on
for
ever
yes
only
they
it
may
be
have
the
right
to
deem
themselves
safe
to
whose
arms
there
come
to
weep
those
whose
eyes
are
heavy
with
tears
and
indeed
there
are
not
a
few
in
this
world
whose
inner
smile
we
can
only
behold
when
our
eyes
have
been
cleansed
by
the
tears
that
lay
bare
the
mysterious
sources
of
vision
and
then
only
do
we
begin
to
detect
the
presence
of
happiness
that
springs
not
from
the
favour
or
gleam
of
an
hour
but
from
widest
acceptance
of
life
here
as
in
much
beside
desire
and
necessity
quicken
our
senses
the
hungry
bee
will
discover
the
honey
be
it
hid
never
so
deep
in
the
cavern
and
the
soul
that
mourns
will
spy
out
the
joy
that
lies
hidden
in
its
retreat
or
in
most
impenetrable
silence
destiny
begins
when
consciousness
wakes
and
bestirs
itself
within
man
not
the
passive
impoverished
consciousness
of
most
souls
but
the
active
consciousness
that
will
accept
the
event
whatever
it
may
be
as
an
imprisoned
queen
will
accept
a
gift
that
is
offered
to
her
in
her
cell
if
nothing
should
happen
your
consciousness
yet
may
create
important
event
from
the
manner
in
which
it
regards
the
mere
dearth
of
event
but
perhaps
to
each
man
there
occurs
vastly
more
than
is
needed
to
satisfy
the
thirstiest
most
indefatigable
consciousness
i
have
at
this
moment
before
me
the
history
of
a
mighty
and
passionate
soul
whom
every
adventure
that
makes
for
the
sorrow
or
gladness
of
man
would
seem
to
have
passed
by
with
averted
head
it
is
of
emily
bronte
i
speak
than
whom
the
first
fifty
years
of
this
century
produced
no
woman
of
greater
or
more
incontestable
genius
she
has
left
but
one
book
behind
her
a
novel
called
wuthering
heights
a
curious
title
which
seems
to
suggest
a
storm
on
a
mountain
peak
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
english
clergyman
the
rev
patrick
bronte
who
was
the
most
insignificant
selfish
lethargic
pretentious
creature
the
mind
can
conceive
there
were
only
two
things
in
life
that
seemed
of
importance
to
him
the
purity
of
his
greek
profile
and
solicitude
for
his
digestion
as
for
emily
unfortunate
mother
her
whole
life
would
seem
to
have
been
spent
in
admiring
this
greek
profile
and
in
studying
this
digestion
but
there
is
scarcely
need
to
dwell
upon
her
existence
for
she
died
only
two
years
after
emily
birth
it
is
of
interest
to
note
however
if
only
to
prove
once
again
that
in
ordinary
life
the
woman
is
usually
superior
to
the
man
she
has
had
to
accept
that
long
after
the
death
of
the
patient
wife
a
bundle
of
letters
was
found
wherein
it
was
clearly
revealed
that
she
who
had
always
been
silent
was
fully
alive
to
the
indifference
and
fatuous
of
her
vain
and
indolent
husband
we
may
it
is
true
be
conscious
of
faults
in
others
from
which
we
are
ourselves
not
exempt
although
to
discover
a
virtue
perhaps
we
must
needs
have
a
germ
of
it
in
us
such
were
parents
around
her
four
sisters
and
one
brother
gravely
watched
the
monotonous
flight
of
the
hours
the
family
dwelling
where
whole
life
was
spent
was
in
the
heart
of
the
yorkshire
moors
at
a
place
called
haworth
a
gloomy
desolate
village
barren
forsaken
and
lonely
there
can
never
have
been
a
childhood
and
youth
so
friendless
monotonous
and
dreary
as
that
of
emily
and
her
sisters
there
came
to
them
none
of
those
happy
little
adventures
bright
gleams
from
the
unexpected
which
we
broider
and
magnify
as
the
years
go
by
and
store
at
last
in
our
soul
as
the
one
inexhaustible
treasure
acquired
by
the
smiling
memory
of
life
each
day
was
the
same
from
first
to
last
lessons
meals
household
duties
work
beside
an
old
aunt
and
long
solitary
walks
that
these
grave
little
girls
would
take
hand
in
hand
speaking
but
seldom
across
the
heather
now
gay
with
blossom
now
white
beneath
the
snow
at
home
the
father
they
scarcely
saw
who
was
wholly
indifferent
who
took
his
meals
in
his
room
and
would
come
down
at
night
to
the
rectory
parlour
and
read
aloud
the
appallingly
dreary
debates
of
the
house
of
commons
without
the
silence
of
the
adjoining
graveyard
the
great
treeless
desert
and
the
moors
that
from
autumn
to
summer
were
swept
by
the
pitiless
wind
from
the
north
the
hazard
of
life
for
in
every
life
some
effort
is
put
forth
by
fate
the
hazard
of
life
removed
emily
three
or
four
times
from
the
desert
she
had
grown
to
love
and
to
consider
as
will
happen
to
those
who
remain
too
long
in
one
spot
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
the
plants
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
were
truly
real
and
delightful
but
after
a
few
weeks
absence
the
light
would
fade
from
her
ardent
beautiful
eyes
she
pined
for
home
and
one
or
another
of
the
sisters
must
hasten
to
bring
her
back
to
the
lonely
vicarage
in
she
was
then
she
returned
once
again
never
more
to
go
forth
until
summoned
by
death
not
an
event
or
a
smile
or
a
whisper
of
love
in
the
whole
of
her
life
to
the
day
of
this
final
return
nor
was
her
memory
charged
with
one
of
those
griefs
or
deceptions
which
enable
the
weaklings
or
those
who
demand
too
little
of
life
to
imagine
that
passive
fidelity
to
something
that
has
of
itself
collapsed
is
an
act
of
virtue
that
inactivity
is
justified
by
the
tears
wherein
it
is
bathed
and
that
the
duty
of
life
is
accomplished
when
suffering
has
been
made
to
yield
up
all
its
resignation
and
sorrow
here
in
this
virgin
soul
whose
past
was
a
blank
there
was
nothing
for
memory
or
resignation
to
cling
to
nothing
before
that
last
journey
as
nothing
after
unless
it
be
mournful
vigils
by
the
side
of
the
brother
she
nursed
the
almost
demented
brother
whose
life
was
wrecked
by
his
idleness
and
a
great
unfortunate
passion
who
became
an
incurable
and
drunkard
then
shortly
before
her
birthday
on
a
december
afternoon
as
she
sat
in
the
little
whitewashed
parlour
combing
her
long
black
hair
the
comb
slipped
from
the
fingers
that
were
too
weak
to
retain
it
and
fell
into
the
fire
and
death
came
to
her
more
silent
even
than
life
and
bore
her
away
from
the
pale
embraces
of
the
two
sisters
whom
fortune
had
left
her
no
touch
of
love
no
hint
of
fame
no
hours
of
ease
lie
for
you
across
the
knees
of
fate
exclaims
miss
mary
robinson
who
has
chronicled
this
existence
in
a
fine
outburst
of
sorrow
and
truly
viewed
from
without
what
life
could
be
more
dreary
and
colourless
more
futile
and
icily
cold
than
that
of
emily
bronte
but
where
shall
we
take
our
stand
when
we
pass
such
a
life
in
review
so
as
best
to
discover
its
truth
to
judge
it
approve
it
and
love
it
how
different
it
all
appears
as
we
leave
the
little
parsonage
hidden
away
on
the
moors
and
let
our
eyes
rest
on
the
soul
of
our
heroine
it
is
rare
indeed
that
we
thus
can
follow
the
life
of
a
soul
in
a
body
that
knew
no
adventure
but
it
is
less
rare
than
might
be
imagined
that
a
soul
should
have
life
of
its
own
which
hardly
depends
if
at
all
on
incident
of
week
or
of
year
in
wuthering
heights
wherein
this
soul
gives
to
the
world
its
passions
desires
reflections
realisations
ideals
which
is
in
a
word
its
real
history
in
wuthering
heights
there
is
more
adventure
more
passion
more
energy
more
ardour
more
love
than
is
needed
to
give
life
or
fulfilment
to
twenty
heroic
existences
twenty
destinies
of
gladness
or
sorrow
not
a
single
event
ever
paused
as
it
passed
by
her
threshold
yet
did
every
event
she
could
claim
take
place
in
her
heart
with
incomparable
force
and
beauty
with
matchless
precision
and
detail
we
say
that
nothing
ever
happened
but
did
not
all
things
really
happen
to
her
much
more
directly
and
tangibly
than
unto
most
of
us
seeing
that
everything
that
took
place
about
her
everything
that
she
saw
or
heard
was
transformed
within
her
into
thoughts
and
feelings
into
indulgent
love
admiration
adoration
of
life
what
matter
whether
the
event
fall
on
our
neighbour
roof
or
our
own
the
the
cloud
brings
with
it
are
for
him
who
will
hold
out
his
vessel
and
the
gladness
the
beauty
the
peace
or
the
helpful
disquiet
that
is
found
in
the
gesture
of
fate
belongs
only
to
him
who
has
learned
to
reflect
love
never
came
to
her
there
fell
never
once
on
her
ear
the
lover
magical
footfall
and
for
all
that
this
virgin
who
died
in
her
year
has
known
love
has
spoken
of
love
has
penetrated
its
most
impenetrable
secrets
to
such
a
degree
that
those
who
have
loved
the
most
deeply
must
sometimes
uneasily
wonder
what
name
they
should
give
to
the
passion
they
feel
when
she
pours
forth
the
words
exaltation
and
mystery
of
a
love
beside
which
all
else
seems
pallid
and
casual
where
if
not
in
her
heart
has
she
heard
the
matchless
words
of
the
girl
who
speaks
to
her
nurse
of
the
man
who
is
hated
and
harassed
by
all
but
whom
she
wholly
adores
my
great
miseries
in
this
world
have
been
heathcliff
miseries
and
i
watched
and
felt
each
from
the
beginning
my
great
thought
in
living
is
himself
if
all
else
perished
and
he
remained
should
still
continue
to
be
and
if
all
else
remained
and
he
were
annihilated
the
universe
would
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger
i
should
not
seem
a
part
of
it
my
love
for
linton
is
like
the
foliage
in
the
woods
time
will
change
it
i
well
aware
as
winter
changes
the
trees
my
love
for
heathcliff
resembles
the
eternal
rocks
beneath
a
source
of
little
visible
delight
but
necessary
nelly
i
am
heathcliff
he
always
always
in
my
mind
not
as
a
pleasure
any
more
than
i
am
always
a
pleasure
to
myself
but
as
my
own
being
i
do
not
love
him
because
he
handsome
but
because
he
more
myself
than
i
am
whatever
our
souls
are
made
of
his
and
mine
are
the
same
she
has
but
little
acquaintance
with
the
external
realities
of
love
and
these
she
handles
so
innocently
at
times
as
almost
to
provoke
a
smile
but
where
can
she
have
acquired
her
knowledge
of
those
inner
realities
that
are
interwoven
with
all
that
is
profoundest
and
most
illogical
in
passion
with
all
that
is
most
unexpected
most
impossible
and
most
eternally
true
we
feel
that
one
must
have
lived
for
thirty
years
beneath
burning
chains
of
burning
kisses
to
learn
what
she
has
learned
to
dare
so
confidently
set
forth
with
such
minuteness
such
unerring
certainty
the
delirium
of
those
two
predestined
lovers
of
wuthering
heights
to
mark
the
movements
of
the
tenderness
that
would
make
suffer
and
the
cruelty
that
would
make
glad
the
felicity
that
prayed
for
death
and
the
despair
that
clung
to
life
the
repulsion
that
desired
the
desire
drunk
with
repulsion
love
surcharged
with
hatred
hatred
staggering
beneath
its
load
of
love
and
yet
it
is
known
to
us
for
in
this
poor
life
of
hers
all
lies
open
that
she
neither
loved
nor
was
loved
may
it
be
true
then
that
the
last
word
of
an
existence
is
only
a
word
that
destiny
whispers
low
to
what
lies
most
hidden
in
our
heart
have
we
indeed
an
inner
life
that
yields
not
in
reality
to
the
outer
life
that
is
no
less
susceptible
of
experience
and
impression
can
we
live
it
matters
not
where
and
love
and
hate
listening
for
no
footfall
spurning
no
creature
is
the
soul
and
is
it
always
the
soul
that
decides
a
certain
height
once
gained
is
it
only
to
those
whose
conscience
still
slumbers
that
events
can
seem
sad
or
sterile
did
not
love
and
beauty
happiness
and
adventure
did
not
all
that
we
go
in
search
of
along
the
ways
of
life
congregate
in
emily
bronte
heart
day
after
day
passed
by
with
never
a
joy
or
emotion
never
a
smile
that
the
eye
could
see
or
the
hand
could
touch
wherefore
none
the
less
did
her
destiny
find
its
fulfilment
for
the
confidence
within
her
the
eagerness
hope
animation
all
were
astir
and
her
heart
was
flooded
with
light
and
radiant
with
silent
gladness
of
her
happiness
none
can
doubt
not
in
the
soul
of
the
best
of
all
those
whose
happiness
has
lasted
the
longest
been
the
most
active
diversified
perfect
could
more
imperishable
harvest
be
found
than
in
the
soul
emily
bronte
lays
bare
if
to
her
there
came
nothing
of
all
that
passes
in
joy
and
in
love
in
sorrow
passion
and
anguish
still
did
she
possess
all
that
abides
when
emotion
has
faded
away
which
of
the
two
will
know
more
of
the
marvellous
palace
the
blind
man
who
lives
there
or
the
other
with
eyes
who
perhaps
only
enters
it
once
to
live
not
to
live
we
must
not
let
mere
words
mislead
us
it
is
surely
possible
to
live
without
thought
but
not
to
think
without
active
life
the
essence
of
the
joy
or
sorrow
the
event
contains
lies
in
the
idea
the
event
gives
birth
to
our
own
idea
if
we
are
strong
that
of
others
if
we
are
weak
on
your
way
to
the
grave
there
may
come
a
thousand
external
events
towards
you
whereof
not
one
it
may
be
shall
find
within
you
the
force
that
it
needs
to
turn
to
moral
event
then
may
you
truthfully
say
and
then
only
i
have
perhaps
not
lived
the
intimate
happiness
of
our
heroine
as
of
every
human
being
was
in
exact
proportion
to
her
morality
and
her
sense
of
the
universe
and
these
indeed
are
the
clearings
in
the
forest
of
accidents
whose
area
it
is
well
we
should
know
when
we
seek
to
measure
the
happiness
a
life
has
experienced
who
that
had
gained
the
altitude
of
peace
and
comprehension
whereon
her
soul
reposed
would
still
be
wrought
to
feeble
bitter
unrefreshing
tears
by
the
cares
and
troubles
and
deceptions
of
ordinary
life
who
would
not
then
understand
why
it
was
that
she
shed
no
tears
unlike
so
many
of
her
sisters
who
spend
their
lives
in
plaintive
wanderings
from
one
broken
joy
to
another
the
joy
that
is
dead
weighs
heavy
and
bids
fair
to
crush
us
if
we
cause
it
to
be
with
us
for
ever
which
is
as
though
a
should
refuse
to
lay
down
his
load
of
dead
wood
for
dead
wood
was
not
made
to
be
eternally
borne
on
the
shoulder
but
indeed
to
be
burned
and
give
forth
brilliant
flame
and
as
we
behold
the
names
that
soar
aloft
in
emily
soul
then
are
we
as
heedless
as
she
was
of
the
sorrows
of
the
dead
wood
no
misfortune
but
has
its
horizon
no
sadness
but
shall
know
comfort
for
the
man
who
in
the
midst
of
his
suffering
in
the
midst
of
the
grief
that
must
come
to
him
as
to
all
has
learned
to
espy
ample
gesture
beneath
all
sorrow
and
suffering
and
has
become
aware
that
this
gesture
alone
is
real
the
sage
who
is
lord
of
his
life
can
never
truly
be
said
to
suffer
wrote
an
admirable
woman
who
had
known
much
sorrow
herself
it
is
from
the
heights
above
that
he
looks
down
on
his
life
and
if
he
should
seem
to
suffer
it
is
only
because
he
has
allowed
his
thoughts
to
incline
towards
the
less
perfect
part
of
his
soul
emily
bronte
not
only
breathes
life
into
tenderness
loyalty
and
love
but
into
hatred
and
wickedness
also
nay
into
the
very
fiercest
revengeful
ness
the
most
deliberate
perfidy
nor
does
she
deem
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
pardon
for
pardon
implies
only
incomplete
comprehension
she
sees
she
admits
and
she
loves
she
admits
the
evil
as
well
as
the
good
she
gives
life
to
both
well
knowing
that
evil
when
all
is
said
is
only
righteousness
strayed
from
the
path
she
reveals
to
us
not
with
the
moralist
arbitrary
formula
but
as
men
and
years
reveal
the
truths
we
have
wit
to
grasp
the
final
helplessness
of
evil
brought
face
to
face
with
life
the
final
appeasement
of
all
things
in
nature
as
well
as
in
death
which
is
only
the
triumph
of
life
over
one
of
its
specialised
forms
she
shows
how
the
dexterous
lie
begotten
of
genius
and
strength
is
forced
to
bow
down
before
the
most
ignorant
puniest
truth
she
shows
the
of
hatred
that
sows
all
unwilling
the
seeds
of
gladness
and
love
in
the
life
that
it
anxiously
schemes
to
destroy
she
is
perhaps
the
first
to
base
a
plea
for
indulgence
on
the
great
law
of
heredity
and
when
at
the
end
of
her
book
she
goes
to
the
village
churchyard
and
visits
the
eternal
of
her
heroes
the
grass
grows
green
alike
over
grave
of
tyrant
and
martyr
and
she
wonders
how
any
one
could
ever
imagine
unquiet
slumbers
for
the
sleepers
in
that
quiet
earth
i
am
well
aware
that
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
woman
of
genius
but
genius
only
throws
into
bolder
relief
all
that
can
and
actually
does
take
place
in
the
lives
of
all
men
otherwise
were
it
genius
no
longer
but
incoherence
or
madness
it
becomes
clear
to
us
after
a
time
that
genius
is
by
no
means
confined
to
the
extraordinary
and
that
veritable
superiority
is
composed
of
elements
that
every
day
offers
to
every
man
but
we
are
not
considering
literature
now
and
indeed
not
by
her
literary
gifts
but
by
her
inner
life
was
emily
bronte
comforted
for
it
by
no
means
follows
that
moral
activity
waits
on
brilliant
literary
powers
had
she
remained
silent
nor
ever
grasped
a
pen
still
had
there
been
no
diminution
of
the
power
within
her
of
the
smile
and
the
fulness
of
love
still
had
she
worn
the
air
of
one
who
knew
whither
her
steps
were
tending
and
the
profound
certainty
that
dwelt
within
her
still
had
proclaimed
that
she
had
known
how
to
make
her
peace
far
up
on
the
heights
with
the
great
disquiet
and
misery
of
the
world
we
should
never
have
known
of
her
that
is
all
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
this
humble
life
and
yet
were
it
perhaps
not
well
to
hold
it
forth
as
an
example
to
such
as
already
incline
overmuch
to
resignation
for
these
it
might
mislead
it
is
a
life
that
would
seem
to
have
been
wholly
passive
and
to
be
passive
is
not
good
for
all
she
died
a
virgin
in
her
year
and
it
is
sad
to
die
a
virgin
is
it
not
the
paramount
duty
of
every
human
being
to
offer
to
his
destiny
all
that
can
be
offered
to
the
destiny
of
man
and
indeed
we
had
far
better
leave
behind
us
work
unfinished
than
life
itself
incomplete
it
is
good
to
be
indifferent
to
vain
or
idle
pleasures
but
we
have
no
right
almost
voluntarily
to
neglect
the
most
important
chances
of
indispensable
happiness
the
soul
that
is
unhappy
may
have
within
it
cause
for
noble
regret
to
look
largely
on
the
sadness
of
one
life
is
to
make
essay
in
the
darkness
of
the
wings
that
shall
one
day
enable
us
to
soar
high
above
this
sadness
effort
was
lacking
perhaps
in
emily
bronte
life
in
her
soul
there
was
wealth
of
passion
and
freedom
and
daring
but
in
her
life
timidity
silence
inertness
conventions
and
prejudice
the
very
things
that
in
thought
she
despised
this
is
the
history
often
of
the
soul
but
it
is
difficult
to
pass
judgment
on
an
entire
existence
and
here
there
were
much
to
be
said
of
the
devotion
wherewith
she
sacrificed
the
best
years
of
her
youth
to
an
undeserving
though
unfortunate
brother
our
remarks
then
in
a
case
such
as
this
must
be
understood
generally
only
but
still
how
long
and
how
narrow
is
the
path
that
leads
from
the
soul
to
life
our
thoughts
of
love
of
justice
and
loyalty
our
thoughts
of
bold
ambition
what
are
all
these
but
acorns
that
fall
from
the
oak
in
the
forest
and
must
not
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
be
lost
and
rot
in
the
lichen
ere
a
single
tree
spring
to
life
she
had
a
beautiful
soul
said
speaking
of
another
woman
the
woman
whose
words
i
quoted
above
a
wide
intellect
and
tender
heart
but
ere
these
qualities
could
issue
forth
into
life
they
had
perforce
to
traverse
a
straitened
character
again
and
again
have
i
wondered
at
this
want
of
of
return
to
self
the
man
who
would
wish
us
to
see
the
deepest
recess
of
his
life
will
begin
by
telling
us
all
that
he
thinks
and
he
feels
will
lead
as
to
his
point
of
view
we
are
conscious
perhaps
of
much
elevation
of
soul
then
as
we
enter
with
him
still
further
into
his
life
he
tells
of
his
conduct
his
joys
and
his
sorrows
and
in
these
we
detect
not
a
gleam
of
the
soul
that
had
shone
through
his
thoughts
and
desires
when
the
trumpet
is
sounded
for
action
the
instincts
rush
in
the
character
hastens
between
but
the
soul
stands
aloof
the
soul
which
is
man
very
highest
being
like
the
princess
who
elects
to
live
on
in
arrogant
penury
rather
than
soil
her
hands
with
ordinary
labour
yes
alas
all
is
useless
till
such
time
as
we
have
learned
to
harden
our
hands
to
transform
the
gold
and
silver
of
thought
into
a
key
that
shall
open
not
the
ivory
gate
of
our
dreams
but
the
very
door
of
this
our
dwelling
into
a
cup
that
shall
hold
not
only
the
wondrous
water
of
dreams
but
the
living
water
that
falls
drop
by
drop
on
our
roof
into
scales
not
content
vaguely
to
balance
schemes
for
the
future
but
that
record
with
unerring
accuracy
what
we
have
done
the
very
loftiest
ideal
has
taken
no
root
within
us
so
long
as
it
penetrate
not
every
limb
so
long
as
it
palpitate
not
at
our
some
there
are
whose
intellect
profits
by
this
return
to
self
with
others
the
character
gains
the
first
have
clearest
vision
for
all
that
concerns
not
themselves
that
calls
them
not
to
action
but
it
is
above
all
when
stern
reality
confronts
them
and
time
for
action
has
come
that
the
eyes
of
the
others
glow
bright
one
might
almost
believe
in
there
being
an
intellectual
consciousness
languidly
resting
for
ever
upon
an
immovable
throne
whence
she
issues
commands
to
the
will
through
faithless
or
indolent
envoys
and
a
moral
consciousness
incessantly
stirring
afoot
at
all
times
ready
to
march
it
may
be
that
this
latter
consciousness
depends
on
the
former
indeed
who
shall
say
that
she
is
not
the
former
wearied
from
long
repose
wherein
she
has
learned
all
that
was
to
be
learned
that
has
at
last
determined
to
rise
to
descend
the
steps
of
inactivity
and
sally
forth
into
life
and
all
will
be
well
if
only
she
have
not
tarried
so
long
that
her
limbs
refuse
their
office
is
it
not
preferable
sometimes
to
act
in
opposition
to
our
thoughts
than
never
dare
to
act
in
accord
with
them
rarely
indeed
is
the
active
error
irremediable
men
and
things
are
quickly
on
the
spot
eager
to
set
it
right
but
they
are
helpless
before
the
passive
error
that
has
shunned
contact
with
the
real
let
all
this
however
by
no
means
be
construed
into
meaning
that
the
intellectual
consciousness
must
be
starved
or
its
growth
arrested
for
fear
lest
it
outpace
the
moral
consciousness
we
need
have
no
fear
no
ideal
conceived
by
man
can
be
too
admirable
for
life
to
conform
with
it
to
float
the
smallest
act
of
justice
or
love
requires
a
very
torrent
of
desire
for
good
for
our
conduct
only
to
be
honest
we
must
have
thoughts
within
us
ten
times
loftier
than
our
conduct
even
to
keep
somewhat
clear
of
evil
bespeaks
enormous
craving
for
good
of
all
the
forces
in
the
world
there
is
none
melts
so
quickly
away
as
the
thought
that
has
to
descend
into
everyday
life
wherefore
we
must
needs
be
heroic
in
thought
for
our
deeds
to
pass
muster
or
at
the
least
be
harmless
let
us
once
again
and
for
the
last
time
return
to
obscure
destinies
they
teach
us
that
physical
misfortune
apart
there
is
remedy
for
all
and
that
to
complain
of
destiny
is
only
to
expose
our
own
feebleness
of
soul
we
are
told
in
the
history
of
rome
how
a
certain
julius
sabinus
a
senator
from
gaul
headed
a
revolt
against
the
emperor
vespasian
and
was
duly
defeated
he
might
have
sought
refuge
among
the
germans
but
only
by
leaving
his
young
wife
eponina
behind
him
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
forsake
her
at
moments
of
disaster
and
sorrow
we
learn
the
true
value
of
life
nor
did
julius
sabinus
welcome
the
idea
of
death
he
possessed
a
villa
beneath
which
there
stretched
vast
subterranean
caverns
known
only
to
him
and
two
freedmen
this
villa
he
caused
to
be
burned
and
the
rumour
was
spread
that
he
had
sought
death
by
poison
and
that
his
body
was
consumed
by
the
flames
eponina
herself
was
deceived
says
plutarch
whose
story
i
follow
with
the
additions
made
thereto
by
the
comte
de
champagny
the
historian
of
antoninus
and
when
martialis
the
freedman
told
her
of
her
husband
she
lay
for
three
days
and
three
nights
on
the
ground
refusing
all
nourishment
when
sabinus
heard
of
her
grief
he
took
pity
and
caused
her
to
know
that
he
lived
she
none
the
less
mourned
and
shed
floods
of
tears
in
the
daytime
when
people
were
near
but
when
night
fell
she
sought
him
below
in
his
cavern
for
seven
long
months
did
she
thus
confront
the
shades
every
night
to
be
with
her
husband
she
even
attempted
to
help
him
escape
she
shaved
off
his
hair
and
his
beard
wrapped
his
head
round
with
fillets
disguised
him
and
then
had
him
sent
in
a
bundle
of
clothes
to
her
own
native
city
but
his
stay
there
becoming
unsafe
she
soon
brought
him
back
to
his
cavern
and
herself
divided
her
stay
between
town
and
the
country
spending
her
nights
with
him
and
from
time
to
time
going
to
town
to
be
seen
by
her
friends
she
became
big
with
child
and
by
means
of
an
unguent
wherewith
she
anointed
her
body
her
condition
remained
unsuspected
by
even
the
women
at
the
baths
which
at
that
time
were
taken
in
common
and
when
her
confinement
drew
nigh
she
went
down
to
her
cavern
and
there
with
no
midwife
alone
she
gave
birth
to
two
sons
as
a
lioness
throws
off
her
cubs
she
nourished
her
twins
with
her
milk
she
nursed
them
through
childhood
and
for
nine
years
she
stood
by
her
husband
in
the
gloom
and
the
darkness
but
sabinus
at
last
was
discovered
and
taken
to
rome
he
surely
would
seem
to
have
merited
vespasian
pardon
eponina
led
forth
the
two
sons
she
had
reared
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
said
to
the
emperor
these
have
i
brought
into
the
world
and
fed
on
my
milk
that
we
might
one
day
be
more
to
implore
thy
forgiveness
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
all
who
were
there
but
caesar
stood
firm
and
the
brave
gaul
at
last
was
reduced
to
demand
permission
to
die
with
her
husband
i
have
known
more
happiness
with
him
in
the
darkness
she
cried
than
thou
ever
shalt
know
o
caesar
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sunshine
or
in
all
the
splendour
of
thy
mighty
empire
who
that
has
a
heart
within
him
can
doubt
the
truth
of
her
words
or
think
without
longing
of
the
darkness
that
so
great
a
love
illumined
many
a
dreary
miserable
hour
must
have
crawled
by
as
they
crouched
in
their
but
are
there
any
even
among
those
who
care
only
for
the
pettiest
pleasures
of
life
who
would
not
rather
love
with
such
depth
and
fervour
in
what
was
almost
a
tomb
than
flaunt
a
frigid
affection
in
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
eponina
magnificent
cry
is
the
cry
of
all
those
whose
hearts
have
been
touched
by
love
as
it
is
also
the
cry
of
those
whose
soul
has
discovered
an
interest
duty
or
even
a
hope
in
life
the
flame
that
inspired
eponina
inspires
the
sage
also
lost
in
monotonous
hours
as
she
in
her
gloomy
retreat
love
is
the
unconscious
sun
of
our
soul
and
it
is
when
its
beams
are
most
ardent
and
purest
that
they
bear
most
surprising
resemblance
to
those
that
the
soul
aglow
with
justice
and
truth
with
beauty
and
majesty
has
kindled
within
itself
and
adds
to
incessantly
is
not
the
happiness
that
accident
brought
to
the
heart
of
eponina
within
reach
of
every
heart
so
the
will
to
possess
it
be
there
is
not
all
that
was
sweetest
in
this
love
of
hers
the
devotion
of
self
the
transformation
of
regret
into
happiness
of
pleasure
renounced
into
joy
that
abides
in
the
heart
for
ever
the
interest
awakened
each
day
by
the
feeblest
glimmer
of
light
so
it
fall
on
a
thing
one
admires
the
immersion
in
radiance
in
happiness
susceptible
of
infinite
expansion
for
one
has
only
to
worship
the
more
are
not
all
these
and
a
thousand
other
forces
no
less
helpful
no
less
consoling
to
be
found
in
the
intensest
life
of
our
soul
of
our
heart
of
our
thoughts
and
was
eponina
love
other
than
a
sudden
lightning
flash
from
this
life
of
the
soul
come
to
her
all
unconscious
and
unprepared
love
does
not
always
reflect
often
indeed
does
it
need
no
reflection
no
search
into
self
to
enjoy
what
is
best
in
thought
but
none
the
less
all
that
is
best
in
love
is
closely
akin
to
all
that
is
best
in
thought
suffering
seemed
ever
radiant
in
aspect
to
eponina
because
of
her
love
but
can
not
this
thing
that
love
brings
about
all
unknowing
by
fortunate
accident
be
also
achieved
by
thought
meditation
by
the
habit
of
looking
beyond
our
immediate
trouble
and
being
more
joyous
than
fate
would
seem
to
demand
to
eponina
there
came
not
a
sorrow
but
kindled
yet
one
more
torch
in
the
gloom
of
her
cavern
and
does
not
the
sadness
that
forces
the
soul
back
into
itself
to
the
retreat
it
has
made
kindle
deep
consolation
there
and
as
the
noble
eponina
has
taken
us
back
to
the
days
of
persecution
may
we
not
liken
such
sorrow
to
the
pagan
executioner
who
suddenly
touched
by
grace
or
perhaps
admiration
in
the
very
midst
of
the
torture
that
he
was
inflicting
flung
himself
down
headlong
at
the
feet
of
his
victim
speaking
words
of
tenderest
sympathy
who
demanded
to
share
her
suffering
and
finally
besought
in
a
kiss
to
be
told
the
way
to
her
heaven
go
where
we
will
the
plentiful
river
of
life
flows
on
beneath
the
canopy
of
heaven
it
flows
between
prison
walls
where
the
sun
never
gleams
on
its
waters
as
it
flows
by
the
palace
steps
where
all
is
gladness
and
glory
not
our
concern
the
depth
of
this
river
or
its
width
or
the
strength
of
its
current
as
it
streams
on
for
ever
pertaining
to
all
but
of
deepest
importance
to
us
is
the
size
and
the
purity
of
the
cup
that
we
plunge
in
its
waters
for
whatever
of
life
we
absorb
must
needs
take
the
form
of
this
cup
as
this
too
has
taken
the
form
of
our
thoughts
and
our
feelings
being
modelled
indeed
on
the
breast
of
our
intimate
destiny
as
the
breast
of
a
goddess
once
served
for
the
cup
of
the
sculptor
of
old
every
man
has
the
cup
of
his
fashioning
and
most
often
the
cup
he
has
learned
to
desire
when
we
murmur
at
fate
let
our
grievance
be
only
that
she
grafted
not
in
our
heart
the
wish
for
or
thought
of
a
cup
more
ample
and
perfect
for
indeed
in
the
wish
alone
does
inequality
lie
but
this
inequality
vanishes
the
moment
it
has
been
perceived
does
the
thought
that
our
wish
might
be
nobler
not
at
once
bring
nobility
with
it
does
not
the
breast
of
our
destiny
throb
to
this
new
aspiration
thereby
expanding
the
docile
cup
of
the
ideal
the
cup
whose
metal
is
pliable
still
to
the
cold
stern
hour
of
death
no
cause
for
complaint
has
he
who
has
learned
that
his
feelings
are
lacking
in
generous
ardour
or
the
other
who
nurses
within
him
a
hope
for
a
little
more
happiness
a
little
more
beauty
a
little
more
justice
for
here
all
things
come
to
pass
in
the
way
that
they
tell
us
it
happens
with
the
felicity
of
the
elect
of
whom
each
one
is
robed
in
gladness
and
wears
the
garment
befitting
his
stature
nor
can
he
desire
a
happiness
more
perfect
than
the
happiness
which
he
possesses
without
the
desire
wherewith
he
desired
at
once
bringing
fulfilment
with
it
if
i
envy
with
noble
envy
the
happiness
of
those
who
are
able
to
plunge
a
heavier
cup
and
more
radiant
than
mine
there
where
the
great
river
is
brightest
i
have
though
i
know
it
not
my
excellent
share
of
all
that
they
draw
from
the
river
and
my
lips
repose
by
the
side
of
their
lips
on
the
rim
of
the
shining
cup
it
may
be
remembered
perhaps
that
before
these
digressions
we
spoke
of
a
woman
whose
friend
asked
her
wonderingly
can
any
man
be
worthy
of
your
love
the
same
question
might
have
been
asked
of
emily
bronte
as
indeed
of
many
others
and
in
this
world
there
are
thousands
of
souls
of
loftiest
intention
that
do
yet
forfeit
the
best
years
of
love
in
constant
as
to
the
future
of
their
affections
nay
more
in
the
empire
of
destiny
it
is
to
the
image
of
love
that
the
great
mass
of
complaints
and
regrets
come
flocking
the
image
of
love
around
which
hover
sluggish
desire
extravagant
hope
and
fears
engendered
of
vanity
at
root
of
all
this
is
much
pride
and
counterfeit
poetry
and
falsehood
the
soul
that
is
misunderstood
is
most
often
the
one
that
has
made
the
least
effort
to
gain
some
knowledge
of
self
the
feeblest
ideal
the
one
that
is
narrowest
straitest
most
often
will
thrive
on
deception
and
fear
on
exaction
and
petty
contempt
we
dread
above
all
lest
any
should
slight
or
pass
by
unnoticed
the
virtues
and
thoughts
the
spiritual
beauty
that
exist
only
in
our
imagination
it
is
with
merits
of
this
nature
as
it
is
with
our
material
welfare
hope
clings
most
persistently
to
that
which
we
probably
never
shall
have
the
strength
to
acquire
the
cheat
through
whose
mind
some
momentary
thought
of
amendment
has
passed
is
amazed
that
we
offer
not
instant
surpassing
homage
to
the
feeling
of
honour
that
has
for
brief
space
found
shelter
within
him
but
if
we
are
truly
pure
and
sincere
and
unselfish
if
our
thoughts
soar
aloft
of
themselves
in
all
simpleness
high
above
vanity
or
instinctive
selfishness
then
are
we
far
less
concerned
than
those
who
are
near
us
should
understand
should
approve
or
admire
epictetus
marcus
aurelius
antoninus
pius
are
not
known
to
have
ever
complained
that
men
could
not
understand
them
they
hugged
no
belief
to
themselves
that
something
extraordinary
incomprehensible
lay
buried
within
them
they
held
on
the
contrary
that
whatever
was
best
in
their
virtue
was
that
which
it
needed
no
effort
for
all
men
to
grasp
and
admit
but
there
are
some
morbid
virtues
that
are
passed
by
unnoticed
and
not
without
reason
for
there
will
almost
always
be
some
superior
reason
for
the
powerlessness
of
a
feeling
morbid
virtues
to
which
we
often
ascribe
far
too
great
an
importance
and
that
virtue
will
surely
be
morbid
that
we
rate
over
highly
and
hold
to
deserve
the
respectful
attention
of
others
in
a
morbid
virtue
there
is
often
more
harm
than
there
is
in
a
healthy
vice
in
any
event
it
is
farther
removed
from
truth
and
there
is
but
little
to
hope
for
when
we
are
divided
from
truth
as
our
ideal
becomes
loftier
so
does
it
become
more
real
and
the
nobler
our
soul
the
less
does
it
dread
that
it
meet
not
a
soul
of
its
stature
for
it
must
have
drawn
near
unto
truth
in
whose
neighbourhood
all
things
must
take
of
its
greatness
when
dante
had
gained
the
third
sphere
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
heavenly
lights
all
shining
with
uniform
splendour
he
saw
that
around
him
naught
moved
and
wondered
was
he
standing
motionless
there
or
indeed
drawing
nearer
unto
the
seat
of
god
so
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
beatrice
and
she
seemed
more
beautiful
to
him
wherefore
he
knew
that
he
was
approaching
his
goal
and
so
can
we
too
count
the
steps
that
we
take
on
the
highway
of
truth
by
the
increase
of
love
that
comes
for
all
that
goes
with
us
in
life
the
increase
of
love
and
of
glad
curiosity
of
respect
and
of
deep
admiration
men
as
a
rule
sally
forth
from
their
homes
seeking
beauty
and
joy
truth
and
love
and
are
glad
to
be
able
to
say
to
their
children
on
their
return
that
they
have
met
nothing
to
be
for
ever
complaining
argues
much
pride
and
those
who
accuse
love
and
life
are
the
ones
who
imagine
that
these
should
bestow
something
more
than
they
can
acquire
for
themselves
love
it
is
true
like
all
else
claims
the
highest
possible
ideal
but
every
ideal
that
conforms
not
with
some
strenuous
inward
reality
is
nothing
but
falsehood
sterile
and
futile
obsequious
falsehood
two
or
three
ideals
that
lie
out
of
our
reach
will
suffice
to
paralyse
life
it
is
wrong
to
believe
that
loftiness
of
soul
is
governed
by
the
loftiness
of
desire
or
dream
the
dreams
of
the
weak
will
be
often
more
numerous
lovelier
than
are
those
of
the
strong
for
these
dreams
absorb
all
their
energy
all
their
activity
the
perpetual
craving
for
loftiness
does
not
count
in
our
moral
advancement
if
it
be
not
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
life
we
have
lived
by
the
firm
and
experienced
will
that
has
come
in
close
kinship
with
man
then
indeed
as
one
places
a
rod
at
the
foot
of
the
steeple
to
tell
of
its
height
by
the
shadow
so
may
we
lead
forth
this
craving
of
ours
to
the
midst
of
the
plain
that
is
lit
by
the
sun
of
external
reality
that
thus
we
may
tell
what
relation
exists
between
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
hour
and
the
dome
of
eternity
it
is
well
that
a
noble
heart
should
await
a
great
love
better
still
that
this
heart
all
expectant
should
cease
not
from
loving
and
that
as
it
loves
it
should
scarcely
be
conscious
of
its
desire
for
more
exquisite
love
in
love
as
in
life
expectation
avails
us
but
little
through
loving
we
learn
to
love
and
it
is
the
disillusions
of
pettier
love
that
will
the
most
simply
and
faithfully
feed
the
immovable
flame
of
the
mightier
love
that
shall
come
it
may
be
to
illumine
the
rest
of
our
life
we
treat
disillusions
often
with
scantiest
justice
we
conceive
them
of
sorrowful
countenance
pale
and
discouraged
whereas
they
are
really
the
very
first
smiles
of
truth
why
should
disillusion
distress
you
if
you
are
a
man
of
honest
intention
if
you
strive
to
be
just
and
of
service
if
you
seek
to
be
happy
and
wise
would
you
rather
live
on
in
the
world
of
your
dreams
and
your
errors
than
in
the
world
that
is
real
only
too
often
does
many
a
promising
nature
waste
its
most
precious
hours
in
the
struggle
of
beautiful
dream
against
inevitable
law
whose
beauty
is
only
perceived
when
every
vestige
of
strength
has
been
sapped
by
the
exquisite
dream
if
love
has
deceived
you
do
you
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
all
your
life
to
regard
love
as
something
it
is
not
and
never
can
be
would
such
an
illusion
not
warp
your
most
significant
actions
would
it
not
for
many
days
hide
from
you
some
part
of
the
truth
that
you
seek
or
if
you
imagine
that
greatness
lay
in
your
grasp
and
disillusion
has
taken
you
back
to
your
place
in
the
second
rank
have
you
the
right
for
the
rest
of
your
life
to
curse
the
envoy
of
truth
for
after
all
was
it
not
truth
your
illusion
was
seeking
assuming
it
to
have
been
sincere
we
should
try
to
regard
disillusions
as
mysterious
faithful
friends
as
councillors
none
can
corrupt
and
should
there
be
one
more
cruel
than
the
rest
that
for
an
instant
prostrates
you
do
not
murmur
to
yourself
through
your
tears
that
life
is
less
beautiful
than
you
had
dreamed
it
to
be
but
rather
that
in
your
dream
there
must
have
been
something
lacking
since
real
life
has
failed
to
approve
and
indeed
the
strength
of
the
strenuous
soul
is
built
up
of
disillusions
only
that
this
soul
has
cheerfully
welcomed
every
deception
and
love
disappointed
every
hope
that
has
crumbled
to
dust
is
possessed
of
a
strength
of
its
own
that
it
adds
to
the
strength
of
your
truth
and
the
more
disillusions
there
are
that
fall
to
the
earth
at
your
feet
the
more
surely
and
nobly
will
great
reality
shine
on
you
even
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
beheld
the
more
clearly
in
winter
as
they
pierce
through
the
leafless
branches
of
the
trees
of
the
forest
and
if
it
be
a
great
love
that
you
seek
how
can
you
believe
that
a
soul
shall
be
met
with
of
beauty
as
great
as
you
dream
it
to
be
if
you
seek
it
with
nothing
but
dreams
have
you
the
right
to
expect
that
definite
words
and
positive
actions
shall
offer
themselves
in
exchange
for
mere
formless
desire
and
yearning
and
vision
yet
thus
it
is
most
of
us
act
and
if
some
fortunate
chance
at
last
accords
our
desire
and
places
us
in
presence
of
the
being
who
is
all
we
had
dreamed
her
to
be
are
we
entitled
to
hope
that
our
idle
and
wandering
cravings
shall
long
be
in
unison
with
her
vigorous
established
reality
our
ideal
will
never
be
met
with
in
life
unless
we
have
first
achieved
it
within
us
to
the
fullest
extent
in
our
power
do
you
hope
to
discover
and
win
for
yourself
a
loyal
profound
inexhaustible
soul
loving
and
quick
with
life
faithful
and
powerful
unconstrained
free
generous
brave
and
benevolent
if
you
know
less
well
than
this
soul
what
all
these
qualities
mean
and
how
should
you
know
if
you
have
not
loved
them
and
lived
in
their
midst
as
this
soul
has
loved
and
lived
most
exacting
of
all
things
unskilful
is
the
moral
beauty
perfection
or
goodness
that
is
still
in
the
shape
of
desire
if
it
be
your
one
hope
to
meet
with
an
ideal
soul
would
it
not
be
well
that
you
yourself
should
endeavour
to
draw
nigh
to
your
own
ideal
be
sure
that
by
no
other
means
will
you
ever
obtain
your
desire
and
as
you
approach
this
ideal
it
will
dawn
on
you
more
and
more
clearly
how
fortunate
and
wisely
ordained
it
has
been
that
the
ideal
should
ever
be
different
from
what
our
vague
hopes
were
expecting
so
too
when
the
ideal
takes
shape
as
it
comes
into
contact
with
life
will
it
soften
expand
and
lose
its
rigidity
incessantly
growing
more
noble
and
then
will
you
readily
perceive
in
the
creature
you
love
all
that
which
is
eternally
true
in
yourself
and
solidly
righteous
and
essentially
beautiful
for
only
the
good
in
our
heart
can
advise
us
of
the
goodness
that
hides
by
our
side
then
at
last
will
the
imperfections
of
others
no
longer
seem
of
importance
to
you
for
they
will
no
longer
be
able
to
wound
your
vanity
selfishness
and
ignorance
imperfections
that
is
which
have
ceased
to
resemble
your
own
for
it
is
the
evil
that
lies
in
ourselves
that
is
ever
least
tolerant
of
the
evil
that
dwells
within
others
let
us
have
the
same
confidence
in
love
that
we
have
in
life
for
confidence
is
of
our
essence
and
the
thought
that
works
the
most
harm
in
all
things
is
the
one
that
inclines
us
to
look
with
mistrust
on
reality
i
have
known
more
than
one
life
that
love
broke
asunder
but
if
it
had
not
been
love
these
lives
would
no
doubt
have
been
broken
no
less
by
friendship
or
apathy
by
doubt
hesitation
indifference
inaction
for
that
only
which
in
itself
is
fragile
can
be
rent
in
the
heart
by
love
and
where
all
is
broken
that
the
heart
contains
then
must
all
have
been
far
too
frail
there
exists
not
a
creature
but
must
more
than
once
have
believed
that
his
life
was
crushed
but
they
whose
life
has
indeed
been
shattered
and
has
fallen
to
ruin
owe
their
misfortune
often
to
some
strange
vanity
of
the
very
ruin
fortunate
and
unfortunate
hazards
there
must
of
necessity
be
in
love
as
in
all
the
rest
of
our
destiny
it
may
so
come
about
that
one
whose
spirit
and
heart
are
abounding
with
tenderness
energy
and
the
noblest
of
human
desires
shall
meet
on
his
first
setting
forth
all
unsought
the
soul
that
shall
satisfy
each
single
craving
of
love
in
the
ecstasy
of
permanent
joy
the
soul
that
shall
content
the
loftiest
yearning
no
less
than
the
lowliest
the
vastest
the
mightiest
no
less
than
the
daintiest
sweetest
the
most
eternal
no
less
than
the
most
evanescent
he
it
may
be
shall
instantly
find
the
heart
whereto
he
can
give
the
heart
which
will
ever
receive
all
that
is
best
in
himself
it
may
happen
that
he
shall
at
once
have
attained
the
soul
that
perchance
is
unique
the
soul
that
is
satisfied
always
and
always
filled
with
desire
the
soul
that
can
ever
receive
many
thousand
times
more
than
is
given
and
that
never
fails
to
return
many
thousand
times
more
than
it
receives
for
the
love
that
the
years
can
not
alter
is
built
up
of
exchanges
like
these
of
sweet
inequality
and
naught
do
we
ever
truly
possess
but
that
which
we
give
in
our
love
and
whatever
our
love
bestows
we
are
no
longer
alone
to
enjoy
destinies
sometimes
are
met
with
that
thus
are
perfectly
happy
and
each
man
it
may
be
is
entitled
to
hope
that
such
may
one
day
be
his
yet
must
his
hope
be
never
permitted
to
fasten
chains
on
his
life
all
he
can
do
is
to
make
preparation
one
day
to
deserve
such
a
love
and
he
will
be
most
patient
and
tranquil
who
incessantly
strives
to
this
end
it
might
so
have
happened
that
he
whom
we
spoke
of
just
now
should
day
after
day
from
youth
to
old
age
have
passed
by
the
side
of
the
wall
behind
which
his
happiness
lay
waiting
enwrapped
in
too
secret
a
silence
but
if
happiness
lie
yonder
side
of
the
wall
must
despair
and
disaster
of
necessity
dwell
on
the
other
is
not
something
of
happiness
to
be
found
in
our
thus
being
able
to
pass
by
the
side
of
our
happiness
is
it
not
better
to
feel
that
a
mere
slender
chance
transparent
one
almost
might
call
it
is
all
that
extends
between
us
and
the
exquisite
love
that
we
dream
of
than
to
be
divided
for
ever
therefrom
by
all
that
is
worthless
within
us
undeserving
inhuman
abnormal
happy
is
he
who
can
gather
the
flower
and
bear
it
away
in
his
bosom
yet
have
we
no
cause
to
pity
the
other
who
walks
until
nightfall
steeped
in
the
glorious
perfume
of
the
flower
no
eyes
can
behold
must
the
life
be
a
failure
useless
and
valueless
that
is
not
as
completely
happy
as
it
possibly
might
have
been
it
is
you
yourself
would
have
brought
what
was
best
in
the
love
you
regret
and
if
as
we
said
the
soul
at
the
end
possess
only
what
it
has
given
does
not
something
already
belong
to
us
when
we
are
incessantly
seeking
for
chances
of
giving
ah
yes
i
declare
that
the
joy
of
a
perfect
abiding
love
is
the
greatest
this
world
contains
and
yet
if
you
find
not
this
love
naught
will
be
lost
of
all
you
have
done
to
deserve
it
for
this
will
go
to
deepen
the
peace
of
your
heart
and
render
still
braver
and
purer
the
calm
of
the
rest
of
your
days
and
besides
we
always
can
love
if
our
own
love
be
admirable
most
of
the
joys
of
admirable
love
will
be
ours
in
the
most
perfect
love
the
lovers
happiness
will
not
be
exactly
the
same
be
their
union
never
so
close
for
the
better
of
the
two
needs
must
love
with
a
love
that
is
deeper
and
the
one
that
loves
with
a
deeper
love
must
be
surely
the
happier
let
your
task
be
to
render
yourself
worthy
of
love
and
this
even
more
for
your
own
happiness
than
for
that
of
another
for
be
sure
that
when
love
is
unequal
and
the
hours
come
clouded
with
sorrow
it
is
not
the
wiser
of
the
two
who
will
suffer
the
most
not
the
one
that
shows
more
generosity
justice
more
passion
the
one
who
is
better
will
rarely
become
the
victim
deserving
our
pity
for
indeed
to
be
truly
a
victim
it
must
be
our
own
faults
our
injustice
wrongdoing
beneath
which
we
suffer
however
imperfect
you
be
you
still
may
suffice
for
the
love
of
a
marvellous
being
but
for
your
love
if
you
are
not
perfect
that
being
will
never
suffice
if
fortune
one
day
should
lead
to
your
dwelling
the
woman
adorned
with
each
gift
of
heart
and
of
intellect
such
a
woman
as
history
tells
of
a
heroine
of
glory
happiness
love
you
will
still
be
all
unaware
if
you
have
not
learned
yourself
to
detect
and
to
love
these
gifts
in
actual
life
and
what
is
actual
life
to
each
man
but
the
life
that
he
lives
himself
all
that
is
loyal
within
you
will
flower
in
the
loyalty
of
the
woman
you
love
whatever
of
truth
there
abides
in
your
soul
will
be
soothed
by
the
truth
that
is
hers
and
her
strength
of
character
can
be
only
enjoyed
by
that
which
is
strong
in
you
and
when
a
virtue
of
the
being
we
love
finds
not
on
the
threshold
of
our
heart
a
virtue
that
resembles
it
somewhat
then
is
it
all
unaware
to
whom
it
shall
give
the
gladness
it
brings
and
whatever
the
fate
your
affections
may
meet
with
do
you
never
lose
courage
above
all
do
not
think
that
love
happiness
having
passed
by
you
you
will
never
right
up
to
the
end
know
the
great
joy
of
human
life
for
though
happiness
appear
in
the
form
of
a
torrent
or
a
river
that
flows
underground
of
a
whirlpool
or
tranquil
lake
its
source
still
is
ever
the
same
that
lies
deep
down
in
our
heart
and
the
unhappiest
man
of
all
men
can
conceive
an
idea
of
great
joy
it
is
true
that
in
love
there
is
ecstasy
that
he
doubtless
never
will
know
but
this
ecstasy
would
leave
deep
melancholy
only
in
the
earnest
and
faithful
heart
if
there
were
not
in
veritable
love
something
more
stable
than
ecstasy
more
profound
and
more
steadfast
and
all
that
in
love
is
profoundest
most
stable
and
steadfast
is
profoundest
in
noble
lives
too
is
most
stable
and
steadfast
in
them
not
to
all
men
is
it
given
to
be
hero
or
genius
victorious
admirable
always
or
even
to
be
simply
happy
in
exterior
things
but
it
lies
in
the
power
of
the
least
favoured
among
us
to
be
loyal
and
gentle
and
just
to
be
generous
and
brotherly
he
that
has
least
gifts
of
all
can
learn
to
look
on
his
fellows
without
envy
or
hatred
without
malice
or
futile
regret
the
outcast
can
take
his
strange
silent
part
which
is
not
always
that
of
least
service
in
the
gladness
of
those
who
are
near
him
he
that
has
barely
a
talent
can
still
learn
to
forgive
an
offence
with
an
ever
nobler
forgiveness
can
find
more
excuses
for
error
more
admiration
for
human
word
and
deed
and
the
man
there
are
none
to
love
can
love
and
reverence
love
and
acting
thus
he
too
will
have
drawn
near
the
source
whither
happy
ones
flock
oftener
far
than
one
thinks
and
in
the
most
ardent
hours
of
happiness
even
the
source
over
which
they
bend
to
make
sure
that
they
truly
are
happy
far
down
at
the
root
of
love
joys
as
at
the
root
of
the
humble
life
of
the
upright
man
from
whom
fate
has
withheld
her
smile
it
is
confidence
sincerity
generosity
tenderness
that
alone
are
truly
fixed
and
unchangeable
love
throws
more
lustre
still
on
these
points
of
light
and
therefore
must
love
be
sought
for
the
greatest
advantage
of
love
is
that
it
reveals
to
us
many
a
peaceful
and
gentle
truth
the
greatest
advantage
of
love
is
that
it
gives
us
occasion
to
love
and
admire
in
one
person
sole
and
unique
what
we
should
have
had
neither
knowledge
nor
strength
to
love
and
admire
in
the
many
and
that
thus
it
expands
our
heart
for
the
time
to
come
and
at
the
root
of
the
most
marvellous
love
there
never
is
more
than
the
simplest
felicity
an
adoration
a
tenderness
within
the
understanding
of
all
a
security
faith
and
fidelity
all
can
acquire
an
intensely
human
admiration
devotion
and
all
these
the
eager
unfortunate
heart
could
know
too
in
its
sorrowful
life
had
it
only
a
little
less
impatience
and
bitterness
a
little
more
initiative
and
energy
the
end
