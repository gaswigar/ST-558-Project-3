e
early
in
gold
was
discovered
in
colorado
and
horace
greeley
the
well
known
writer
and
a
power
throughout
the
country
both
before
and
during
the
civil
war
made
in
the
interest
of
the
york
of
which
he
was
editor
an
overland
trip
to
denver
by
the
first
stage
line
run
in
that
day
he
started
from
leavenworth
kansas
and
with
the
exception
of
richardson
of
the
was
the
only
passenger
in
the
coach
the
trip
was
not
all
that
could
be
desired
for
they
met
with
numerous
hardships
and
many
narrow
escapes
as
did
hundreds
of
others
who
had
preceded
them
over
that
dangerous
trail
many
never
reaching
their
destination
having
met
death
at
the
hands
of
the
cruel
indians
of
the
plains
during
his
stay
in
denver
greeley
wrote
a
number
of
letters
to
the
york
confirming
the
finding
of
gold
in
the
territory
and
advising
immigration
the
people
in
the
east
were
skeptical
in
regard
to
its
discovery
and
awaited
a
written
statement
from
him
to
this
effect
at
the
close
of
the
war
greeley
advice
to
young
men
through
the
columns
of
his
paper
was
to
go
west
and
grow
up
with
the
country
and
it
became
a
byword
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
nation
young
man
go
west
and
grow
up
with
the
country
could
greeley
have
foreseen
the
number
of
young
lives
that
were
to
be
sacrificed
through
his
advice
i
think
he
would
have
hesitated
before
giving
it
yet
it
was
the
most
valued
utterance
of
any
public
man
of
that
day
for
the
settlement
of
the
then
far
west
after
reading
a
number
of
these
letters
in
the
york
i
became
very
enthusiastic
over
the
opportunities
that
the
west
offered
for
the
young
man
there
was
also
a
loyal
friend
of
mine
who
became
as
enthusiastic
over
it
as
myself
thus
while
we
were
still
so
young
as
to
be
called
boys
we
made
up
our
minds
to
follow
advice
and
go
west
and
grow
up
with
the
country
illustration
of
trails
leading
from
missouri
river
to
denver
colorado
in
making
our
purchases
for
the
trip
we
were
obliged
to
make
our
plans
known
to
an
acquaintance
who
at
once
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
us
after
consultation
we
consented
and
at
the
appointed
time
the
fore
part
of
july
just
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
we
boarded
a
new
york
central
train
at
the
depot
in
geneva
with
no
thought
of
the
hardships
and
dangers
we
would
be
called
upon
to
meet
the
first
night
found
us
at
the
falls
of
niagara
the
most
stupendous
production
of
nature
that
the
country
was
known
to
possess
at
that
time
our
time
was
divided
between
the
american
and
canadian
sides
viewing
the
grand
spectacle
at
all
hours
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
awed
by
the
marvelous
masterpiece
of
grandeur
we
were
held
as
if
fascinated
by
its
beauty
until
we
were
forced
to
leave
for
the
want
of
food
and
to
replenish
our
commissary
when
we
boarded
the
cars
to
be
whirled
through
the
then
wilds
of
lower
canada
we
were
liberally
supplied
with
the
best
the
country
produced
upon
the
fifth
day
we
rolled
into
chicago
the
cosmopolitan
city
of
the
west
two
days
later
we
reached
quincy
where
we
made
connection
with
the
old
hannibal
joe
railroad
which
was
to
take
us
through
missouri
to
atchison
kansas
missouri
after
the
war
was
not
an
ideal
state
for
a
law
abiding
citizen
much
less
for
inexperienced
youths
of
our
age
and
we
quickly
realized
that
fact
many
stations
had
their
quota
of
what
was
termed
the
missouri
bushwhacker
or
more
plainly
speaking
outlaws
who
during
the
war
and
for
some
time
after
pillaged
the
state
and
surrounding
country
leaving
in
their
wake
death
and
destruction
they
had
belonged
to
neither
side
at
war
but
were
a
set
of
villians
banded
together
to
plunder
burn
ravage
and
murder
young
and
old
alike
as
wicked
a
set
of
villians
as
the
world
has
ever
known
at
many
stations
they
would
nearly
fill
the
car
making
it
very
unpleasant
for
the
passengers
their
language
and
insults
caused
every
one
to
be
guarded
in
conversation
the
condition
of
the
road
however
often
gave
us
relief
as
we
were
obliged
to
alight
and
walk
at
times
when
arriving
at
a
point
where
ties
or
rails
had
to
be
replaced
its
entire
length
showed
the
carnage
and
destruction
of
war
making
travel
slow
and
dangerous
as
well
as
uncomfortable
on
reaching
the
state
of
bleeding
kansas
and
the
then
village
of
atchison
we
were
about
used
up
we
at
once
called
at
the
ben
holiday
stage
office
and
inquired
the
price
of
a
ticket
to
denver
but
finding
it
to
be
beyond
our
means
we
decided
to
go
by
ox
conveyance
commanche
bill
we
were
not
long
in
finding
what
in
those
days
was
called
a
tavern
located
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
having
been
chosen
spokesman
i
stepped
up
to
the
rough
board
counter
and
registered
we
were
soon
confronted
by
the
toughest
individual
we
had
yet
seen
i
pleasantly
bade
him
good
morning
but
received
no
immediate
recognition
save
a
wild
stare
from
two
horrible
bloodshot
eyes
i
quickly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
were
up
against
the
real
western
article
nor
was
i
mistaken
he
did
keep
up
waiting
long
for
he
soon
roared
out
an
oath
and
wanted
to
know
where
we
were
from
after
telling
him
as
near
as
i
possibly
could
under
the
circumstances
he
again
became
silent
his
look
and
brace
of
revolvers
were
not
reassuring
to
say
the
least
he
soon
came
out
of
his
trance
and
did
not
keep
us
long
in
suspense
for
his
next
act
was
to
pull
out
both
of
his
and
not
in
very
choice
language
introduce
himself
as
commanche
bill
from
arkansas
emphasizing
the
arkansas
by
letting
the
contents
of
both
of
his
instruments
of
death
pierce
the
ceiling
of
his
story
and
a
half
shack
i
have
wondered
many
times
since
that
i
am
alive
we
had
been
told
by
a
fellow
passenger
that
atchison
was
a
little
short
of
hades
and
we
were
fast
realizing
that
our
informer
was
not
far
out
of
the
way
yet
it
was
a
haven
in
comparison
to
other
places
at
which
we
were
yet
to
arrive
commanche
william
or
whatever
his
right
name
might
have
been
was
a
different
person
after
his
forceful
introduction
he
began
to
question
me
he
asked
me
if
we
had
any
money
yes
any
friends
certainly
well
then
you
had
better
get
straight
back
to
them
for
if
you
remain
in
these
parts
long
they
will
be
unable
to
recognize
you
where
are
you
fellows
headed
for
anyway
denver
colorado
by
stage
no
sir
by
ox
or
mule
conveyance
you
are
too
light
weight
no
freighter
will
hire
you
they
will
or
we
walk
you
will
not
walk
far
for
the
indians
along
the
platte
are
ugly
by
the
way
do
you
pards
ever
take
anything
not
wishing
to
offend
such
a
character
i
gave
my
companions
the
wink
and
we
followed
him
into
the
with
the
full
determination
of
making
a
friend
of
him
after
all
had
done
the
sociable
act
of
course
gentlemen
only
drink
for
sociability
sake
i
took
him
to
one
side
purposely
to
draw
him
into
a
little
private
chat
and
it
was
not
long
before
his
had
the
better
of
him
he
ordered
grub
as
all
meals
were
called
in
the
west
in
those
days
for
four
stating
he
was
in
need
of
a
bite
himself
before
the
meal
had
been
finished
i
became
convinced
that
the
old
fellow
had
a
tender
spot
in
his
makeup
like
all
tough
outlaws
and
if
one
had
tact
enough
to
discover
it
he
might
have
great
influence
over
him
otherwise
we
would
be
obliged
to
sleep
with
both
eyes
open
and
each
with
his
right
hand
on
the
butt
of
his
revolver
the
american
indian
the
following
day
was
passed
in
taking
in
the
town
and
indian
reservation
which
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
place
there
we
came
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
the
american
indian
the
sole
owner
of
this
vast
and
fertile
continent
before
the
paleface
landed
to
dispute
his
right
of
ownership
foot
by
foot
they
had
been
driven
from
east
north
and
south
until
at
that
time
they
were
nearly
all
west
of
the
great
missouri
river
or
river
of
mud
as
the
indians
called
it
at
the
suggestion
of
our
landlord
we
took
with
us
an
interpreter
a
few
trinkets
and
something
to
moisten
the
old
chief
lips
upon
our
arrival
we
were
duly
presented
to
the
chief
who
invited
us
to
sit
on
the
ground
upon
fur
robes
made
from
the
pelts
of
different
animals
including
the
antelope
and
the
buffalo
or
american
bison
the
monarch
of
the
plains
and
each
one
of
us
in
turn
took
a
pull
at
the
pipe
of
peace
we
then
made
a
tour
of
their
lodges
when
we
returned
the
chief
called
his
squaws
to
whom
we
presented
our
gifts
which
pleased
them
greatly
to
the
old
chief
i
handed
a
bottle
of
atchison
best
as
he
grasped
it
a
smile
stole
over
his
ugly
face
and
with
a
healthy
grunt
and
a
broad
grin
he
handed
me
back
the
empty
bottle
indians
love
liquor
better
than
they
do
their
squaws
in
return
he
gave
me
a
buffalo
robe
which
later
became
of
great
service
after
taking
another
pull
at
the
pipe
of
peace
we
thanked
him
and
took
our
departure
having
no
desire
to
be
present
when
invigorator
commenced
to
invigorate
his
indian
brain
the
impression
made
by
that
visit
to
a
supposedly
friendly
tribe
who
at
that
time
had
a
peace
treaty
with
the
government
was
not
one
of
confidence
the
noble
red
men
as
they
were
called
by
the
eastern
philanthropist
were
as
treacherous
to
the
whites
as
an
ocean
squall
to
the
navigator
no
pen
or
picture
has
or
can
fully
describe
the
cruelty
of
their
nature
it
was
dusk
when
we
reached
our
tavern
and
we
found
it
filled
with
a
lawless
band
of
degenerates
as
repulsive
as
any
that
ever
invested
western
plains
or
canyons
of
the
rockies
we
were
at
once
surrounded
and
by
a
display
of
their
shooting
irons
forced
to
join
in
their
beastly
carnival
it
was
not
for
long
however
for
a
sign
from
the
landlord
brought
me
to
his
side
he
whispered
when
i
let
my
guns
loose
you
fellows
pike
for
the
loft
there
were
no
stairs
no
sooner
had
he
pulled
his
than
all
the
others
followed
his
example
bullets
flew
in
every
direction
clouds
of
smoke
filled
the
room
but
we
had
ducked
and
scaled
the
ladder
to
the
loft
and
safety
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
for
the
night
was
made
hideous
by
blasphemous
language
howls
of
pain
and
the
ring
of
revolvers
the
first
call
for
grub
found
us
ready
and
much
in
need
of
a
nerve
quieter
which
the
old
sinner
laughingly
supplied
but
no
word
from
him
of
the
night
bloody
work
taking
me
to
one
side
he
said
take
no
offence
but
repeat
nothing
you
hear
or
see
in
these
parts
and
strictly
mind
your
own
business
and
a
fellow
like
you
will
get
into
no
trouble
i
thanked
him
and
followed
his
advice
to
the
letter
during
my
entire
western
life
the
first
camp
after
that
night
experience
we
decided
to
pay
our
bill
and
become
acclimated
to
camp
life
we
had
taken
with
us
a
tent
blankets
and
three
toy
pistols
the
latter
entirely
useless
in
that
country
which
proved
how
ignorant
we
were
of
western
ways
we
were
not
long
in
finding
a
suitable
camping
spot
a
mile
from
the
town
and
the
same
distance
from
the
many
corrals
of
the
great
western
freighters
and
pilgrims
as
the
immigrants
were
called
for
miles
we
could
see
those
immense
white
covered
prairie
schooners
in
corral
formation
hundreds
of
oxen
and
mules
were
quietly
grazing
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
their
herders
in
saddle
it
was
certainly
a
novel
sight
to
the
tenderfoot
we
soon
had
our
tent
up
and
leaving
one
of
our
number
in
charge
the
other
two
went
to
town
for
the
necessary
camp
utensils
and
grub
immediately
on
our
return
supper
was
prepared
and
the
novelty
enjoyed
after
a
three
days
rest
i
started
out
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
corrals
in
search
of
a
driver
berth
all
freighters
had
a
wagon
boss
and
an
assistant
who
rightfully
had
the
reputation
of
being
tyrants
when
on
the
trail
using
tact
and
discretion
when
in
camp
a
revolver
settled
all
disputes
on
approaching
them
they
treated
me
as
well
as
their
rough
natures
would
permit
but
i
did
not
take
kindly
to
any
of
them
they
all
told
me
that
i
was
undersized
and
too
young
to
stand
the
dangers
and
hardships
of
a
trip
i
returned
to
camp
much
disappointed
but
not
discouraged
the
following
morning
we
proceeded
to
the
large
warehouses
on
the
river
front
where
all
western
freighters
were
to
be
found
in
those
days
all
emigrants
and
oxen
and
mule
trains
with
freight
going
to
the
far
western
territories
would
start
from
either
council
bluffs
iowa
leavenworth
kansas
atchison
or
joe
missouri
atchison
being
the
nearest
point
a
large
majority
embarked
from
there
the
freight
was
brought
up
the
missouri
river
in
propelled
by
a
large
wheel
at
the
stern
and
unloaded
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
perishable
goods
were
placed
in
the
large
warehouses
but
the
unperishable
were
covered
with
tarpaulin
and
left
where
unloaded
they
were
then
transferred
to
large
white
covered
prairie
schooners
and
shipped
to
their
different
points
of
destination
in
trains
of
from
to
one
hundred
wagons
the
rate
for
freighting
depended
on
the
condition
of
the
indians
and
ran
from
ten
cents
per
pound
up
to
enormous
charges
in
some
cases
securing
passage
after
making
application
to
several
of
the
freighters
and
receiving
the
same
reply
as
from
the
wagon
bosses
we
went
a
short
distance
down
the
river
to
the
last
of
the
warehouses
on
our
approach
we
discovered
a
genuine
bullwhacker
as
all
ox
drivers
were
called
in
that
day
in
conversation
with
a
short
fellow
with
red
hair
and
whiskers
to
match
the
moment
he
became
disengaged
i
inquired
if
he
was
a
freighter
he
said
that
he
was
and
that
he
wanted
more
men
his
name
was
whitehead
just
the
opposite
to
the
color
of
his
hair
and
as
i
stepped
up
to
him
i
wondered
what
kind
of
a
disposition
the
combination
made
whitehead
redhead
i
at
once
made
application
for
a
position
for
the
three
of
us
in
rather
a
disagreeable
voice
he
asked
me
if
i
could
drive
i
replied
that
i
could
can
you
handle
a
gun
and
revolver
certainly
how
many
trips
have
you
made
none
then
how
the
devil
do
you
know
you
can
drive
for
the
simple
reason
i
am
more
than
anxious
to
learn
and
so
are
my
friends
then
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
position
we
were
in
and
urged
him
to
give
us
a
chance
well
he
said
you
seem
to
be
a
determined
little
cuss
are
the
rest
of
the
same
timber
i
told
him
they
were
of
the
same
wood
but
not
of
the
same
tree
after
thinking
the
matter
over
he
said
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
hire
the
big
fellow
for
driver
at
one
hundred
and
dollars
per
month
and
the
little
fellow
for
night
herder
at
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
yourself
for
cook
for
one
mess
of
men
and
for
driver
in
case
of
sickness
or
death
at
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
we
then
gave
him
our
names
and
in
return
he
gave
us
a
note
to
perry
his
wagon
boss
we
at
once
started
for
his
corral
two
miles
distant
where
we
found
the
gentleman
he
asked
where
our
traps
were
we
told
him
and
also
assured
him
that
we
would
report
for
duty
the
following
morning
when
we
reached
our
camp
we
were
completely
tired
out
but
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
celebrating
our
success
and
feeling
assured
that
if
we
escaped
the
scalping
knife
of
the
indians
we
would
reach
denver
in
due
time
and
when
paid
off
have
a
nice
sum
in
dollars
the
following
morning
we
had
an
early
breakfast
broke
camp
and
reported
at
the
corral
where
each
was
presented
with
two
revolvers
and
a
repeating
carbine
i
was
then
taken
over
to
the
mess
wagon
which
was
liberally
supplied
with
bacon
in
the
rough
flour
beans
cargum
or
sour
molasses
coffee
salt
pepper
and
dried
apples
the
latter
we
were
allowed
three
times
a
week
for
dessert
there
was
also
a
skillet
for
baking
bread
which
resembled
a
covered
spider
without
a
handle
when
the
assistant
cook
with
whom
i
was
favored
had
started
the
fire
and
sufficient
coals
had
accumulated
he
would
rake
them
out
and
place
the
skillet
on
them
as
soon
as
the
dough
was
prepared
a
chunk
was
cut
off
and
put
in
the
skillet
the
lid
placed
and
covered
with
coals
in
fifteen
minutes
we
would
have
as
nice
a
looking
loaf
of
bread
as
one
could
wish
to
see
browned
to
a
tempting
color
when
eaten
warm
it
was
very
palatable
but
when
cold
only
bullwhackers
could
digest
it
an
iron
kettle
in
which
to
stew
the
beans
and
boil
the
dried
apples
or
vice
versa
coffee
pots
frying
pans
tin
plates
cups
iron
knives
and
forks
spoons
and
a
combination
dish
and
made
up
the
remainder
of
the
cooking
and
eating
utensils
experiences
among
the
bushwhackers
it
seemed
that
my
assistant
was
exempt
from
bringing
water
which
often
had
to
be
carried
in
kegs
for
two
miles
so
he
fried
the
meat
and
washed
the
dishes
i
soon
caught
on
to
the
cooking
and
doing
my
best
to
please
everyone
soon
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
had
many
friends
among
the
toughest
individuals
on
earth
the
professional
bullwhackers
who
according
to
their
own
minds
were
very
important
personages
their
good
qualities
were
few
and
consisted
of
being
a
sure
shot
and
expert
at
lariat
and
they
would
bet
a
tenderfoot
a
small
sum
that
they
could
at
a
distance
of
twelve
feet
abstract
a
small
piece
from
his
trousers
without
disturbing
the
flesh
they
could
do
this
trick
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
whips
consisted
of
a
hickory
stalk
two
feet
long
a
lash
twelve
feet
in
length
with
buck
or
antelope
skin
snapper
nine
inches
in
length
the
stalk
was
held
in
the
left
hand
the
lash
coiled
with
the
right
hand
and
index
finger
of
the
left
it
was
then
whirled
several
times
around
the
head
letting
it
shoot
straight
out
and
bringing
it
back
with
a
quick
jerk
it
would
strike
wherever
aimed
raising
a
ox
nearly
off
its
hind
quarters
and
cutting
through
the
hide
and
into
the
flesh
when
thrown
into
space
it
would
make
a
report
nearly
as
loud
as
a
revolver
a
lariat
is
a
fifty
foot
line
with
a
running
noose
at
one
end
and
made
from
the
hide
of
various
animals
it
is
coiled
up
and
carried
on
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
when
used
for
capturing
animals
or
large
game
it
is
whirled
several
times
around
the
head
when
the
horse
is
on
a
dead
run
and
fired
at
the
head
of
the
victim
a
professional
can
place
the
loop
nearly
every
time
during
the
third
day
of
corral
life
the
steers
arrived
and
the
hard
work
mixed
with
much
fun
commenced
a
corral
is
about
the
shape
of
an
egg
closed
by
the
wagons
at
one
end
and
left
open
to
admit
the
cattle
at
the
other
then
closed
by
chains
means
of
transportation
our
wheelers
and
leaders
were
docile
old
freighters
the
others
were
wild
texas
steers
all
of
the
freighters
had
their
oxen
branded
for
identification
using
the
first
letter
of
his
last
name
for
the
purpose
the
brand
was
made
from
iron
and
was
about
four
inches
in
height
attached
to
a
rod
three
feet
in
length
a
rope
was
placed
over
the
horns
of
the
animal
and
his
head
was
drawn
tight
to
the
hub
of
a
heavy
laden
prairie
schooner
a
bullwhacker
tightly
grasping
the
tail
of
the
beast
would
twist
him
to
attention
the
man
with
the
branding
implement
heated
to
a
white
heat
would
quickly
jab
the
ox
on
the
hind
quarter
burning
through
hair
and
hide
and
into
the
flesh
then
after
applying
a
solution
of
salt
and
water
he
was
left
to
recover
as
best
he
could
the
brand
would
remain
in
evidence
more
than
a
year
unless
the
steer
was
captured
by
cattle
thieves
who
possessed
a
secret
for
growing
the
hair
again
in
six
months
when
the
branding
was
completed
each
man
was
given
twelve
steers
to
break
to
yoke
and
it
was
three
long
weeks
before
we
were
in
shape
to
proceed
on
our
long
western
tramp
the
cattle
were
driven
in
each
morning
at
break
of
day
the
same
time
as
when
on
trail
each
man
with
a
yoke
on
his
left
shoulder
and
a
bow
in
his
right
hand
would
go
groping
about
in
almost
total
darkness
to
select
his
twelve
steers
when
they
were
all
found
he
would
yoke
them
and
hitch
them
to
the
wagons
the
wheelers
to
the
tongue
the
leaders
in
front
and
the
balance
to
section
chains
for
days
we
were
obliged
to
lariat
the
wildest
of
them
and
draw
their
heads
to
the
hubs
of
the
heavily
laden
wagons
before
being
able
to
adjust
the
yoke
many
times
receiving
a
gentle
reminder
from
the
hind
hoof
of
one
of
the
critters
to
be
more
careful
i
went
into
the
fray
with
the
full
determination
of
learning
the
profession
of
driver
and
at
the
tenth
day
i
had
broken
in
a
team
of
extras
on
the
sick
list
i
was
then
taken
sick
and
for
two
long
weeks
kept
my
bed
of
earth
under
the
mess
wagon
with
no
mother
or
doctor
and
two
thousand
miles
from
home
you
may
be
able
to
imagine
my
feelings
but
i
doubt
it
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
perry
came
and
told
me
they
would
make
a
start
the
next
afternoon
and
in
his
judgment
he
thought
it
unwise
to
think
of
making
the
trip
in
my
present
condition
i
knew
my
condition
was
serious
but
i
would
rather
have
died
on
the
road
among
those
outlaws
than
to
have
been
left
in
atchison
among
entire
strangers
they
were
all
very
kind
and
did
what
they
could
for
me
but
were
powerless
to
check
my
fast
failing
strength
i
had
wasted
to
less
than
one
hundred
pounds
in
weight
and
was
too
weak
to
even
lift
an
arm
i
pleaded
with
perry
for
some
time
and
finally
overcame
his
objections
well
he
said
charlie
i
will
fix
a
bed
in
my
wagon
and
you
can
bunk
with
me
i
objected
for
i
did
not
wish
to
discommode
him
in
the
least
and
told
him
a
good
bed
could
be
fixed
in
the
mess
wagon
as
you
will
he
said
and
had
the
boys
get
some
straw
which
together
with
the
buffalo
robe
made
a
very
comfortable
bed
when
not
on
the
move
a
thunder
storm
the
next
day
they
picked
me
up
and
put
me
in
the
second
or
reserve
mess
wagon
shortly
after
that
the
start
was
made
we
had
covered
less
than
two
miles
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
the
rumbling
of
distant
thunder
very
soon
rain
began
to
patter
on
the
canvas
covering
of
my
wagon
then
heaven
artillery
broke
loose
and
the
water
came
down
in
torrents
never
in
my
young
life
had
i
witnessed
such
a
storm
it
seemed
as
if
thunder
lightning
and
clouds
had
descended
to
earth
and
were
mad
with
anger
the
racket
was
deafening
between
the
angered
claps
could
be
heard
the
cursing
of
those
missouri
bushwhackers
who
in
their
oaths
defied
the
almighty
to
do
his
worst
and
hurled
unspeakable
insults
at
the
memory
of
the
mothers
who
gave
them
birth
i
knew
they
were
trying
hard
to
make
corral
whether
they
could
do
it
rested
entirely
with
the
wagon
boss
the
cattle
were
crazed
with
fright
and
the
moment
they
were
loose
would
certainly
stampede
the
oxen
were
finally
unyoked
and
such
a
snorting
and
bellowing
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
as
the
racket
died
away
in
their
mad
race
my
thoughts
turned
to
my
chum
who
i
knew
was
with
them
and
would
be
trampled
beyond
recognition
by
their
hoofs
if
he
had
not
gained
his
proper
position
in
the
rear
illustration
log
cabin
in
kansas
the
log
cabin
at
that
juncture
the
front
flaps
of
my
wagon
were
parted
and
at
a
flash
i
recognized
two
of
the
men
who
bore
me
across
the
way
to
the
old
log
cabin
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
then
western
civilization
as
they
laid
me
down
i
swooned
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
fright
before
i
had
become
fully
conscious
i
heard
that
gruff
old
wagon
boss
telling
the
good
woman
of
the
cabin
to
spare
nothing
for
my
comfort
she
felt
of
my
pulse
asked
me
a
few
questions
and
assured
him
that
she
would
soon
have
me
on
my
feet
he
bade
god
bless
me
and
passed
out
into
the
dark
and
stormy
night
the
good
woman
poked
up
the
fire
and
placed
an
iron
in
position
to
do
its
duty
at
that
juncture
a
young
miss
about
my
own
age
came
from
somewhere
as
if
by
magic
and
was
told
by
the
good
mother
to
prepare
a
chicken
that
she
might
make
broth
for
the
sick
young
man
pointing
to
where
i
lay
for
two
hours
that
good
mother
worked
over
me
now
and
then
giving
me
draughts
of
hot
herb
tea
while
the
daughter
deftly
prepared
nature
wild
bird
of
the
prairie
occasionally
shooting
darts
of
sympathy
from
her
jet
black
eyes
when
the
bird
had
been
cooked
the
meat
and
bones
were
removed
leaving
only
the
broth
which
was
seasoned
to
a
nicety
and
given
me
in
small
quantities
and
at
short
intervals
until
early
morning
when
i
passed
into
dreamland
with
the
mother
keeping
vigil
as
though
i
were
her
own
son
when
i
awoke
i
felt
refreshed
and
comfortable
and
found
her
still
at
my
side
doing
for
me
that
which
only
a
mother
can
at
daybreak
i
heard
footsteps
above
presently
the
father
and
son
came
in
the
daughter
was
called
and
breakfast
was
prepared
they
told
me
that
our
cattle
had
stampeded
and
it
might
be
days
before
they
were
found
after
a
three
days
search
my
chum
and
the
cattle
were
overtaken
miles
from
camp
but
none
the
worse
for
their
fearful
experience
the
moment
he
arrived
he
came
to
see
me
i
was
sitting
up
for
the
first
time
wrapped
in
indian
blankets
but
very
weak
i
assured
him
that
i
would
certainly
get
well
emphasizing
the
fact
however
that
had
we
not
run
into
that
fearful
storm
making
my
present
haven
of
care
possible
i
could
never
have
recovered
and
believed
that
the
prayers
of
a
loving
mother
at
home
had
been
answered
a
cattle
stampede
he
then
related
his
experience
with
those
cattle
the
first
clap
of
thunder
awoke
him
and
when
the
rain
began
he
knew
he
was
in
for
a
bad
night
and
had
taken
every
precaution
to
supply
himself
with
all
things
needful
his
description
of
the
storm
and
mad
race
to
keep
up
with
those
wild
animals
crazed
with
fright
was
enough
to
congeal
the
blood
of
a
well
man
and
in
my
condition
it
nearly
unnerved
me
but
i
was
delighted
to
know
that
he
was
safe
for
we
were
like
brothers
his
safe
arrival
together
with
the
motherly
care
i
had
received
and
was
receiving
put
me
rapidly
on
the
gain
not
a
morning
passed
that
the
daughter
did
not
shoulder
her
trusty
rifle
and
go
out
in
search
of
some
refreshment
for
me
always
returning
with
a
number
of
chickens
of
the
prairie
she
was
a
sure
shot
as
were
the
entire
family
for
they
were
all
born
and
brought
up
on
the
border
moving
farther
west
as
the
country
became
settled
from
the
father
i
learned
the
treachery
of
the
indians
their
mode
of
warfare
and
different
methods
of
attack
in
fact
i
had
the
devilish
traits
of
the
noble
red
men
as
history
called
them
down
to
a
nicety
when
the
daughter
day
work
was
done
she
would
read
to
me
and
relate
stories
of
her
life
which
reminded
me
of
the
wild
rose
in
all
its
purity
and
strength
the
fifth
day
after
the
cattle
were
found
the
train
broke
corral
and
proceeded
on
its
long
western
tramp
before
leaving
perry
made
arrangements
with
the
old
borderman
for
me
to
overtake
them
as
soon
as
i
was
able
illustration
the
march
of
destiny
the
fourth
day
after
the
train
had
left
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
start
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
and
so
informed
my
western
friends
whom
i
felt
had
saved
my
life
the
old
borderman
expressed
regret
at
my
leaving
and
informed
me
that
both
he
and
his
son
would
accompany
me
to
camp
i
thanked
him
and
assured
him
that
i
felt
a
mother
could
not
have
done
more
for
her
own
son
than
his
wife
had
for
me
they
had
all
shown
me
every
consideration
possible
and
that
i
should
always
remember
them
which
i
have
at
this
juncture
the
mother
spoke
up
gently
but
firmly
and
addressing
her
husband
said
if
you
have
no
objection
daughter
will
accompany
young
she
is
a
sure
shot
a
good
horsewoman
and
the
horses
are
fleet
of
foot
we
have
not
heard
of
any
indians
in
the
neighborhood
for
some
time
and
besides
she
wants
to
go
and
the
ride
will
do
her
good
he
replied
my
good
woman
you
can
not
tell
where
the
indians
are
they
may
be
miles
away
today
but
here
this
very
night
that
is
true
she
said
but
the
stage
driver
told
me
that
he
had
not
seen
a
redskin
since
crossing
the
nebraska
line
that
may
be
he
replied
still
they
may
have
been
in
the
bluffs
or
sand
hills
watching
their
opportunity
to
surprise
one
of
the
many
small
trains
of
pilgrims
thinking
to
overpower
them
run
off
their
cattle
and
massacre
all
yes
that
is
all
true
but
i
wager
they
could
not
catch
our
girl
after
thinking
silently
for
a
few
moments
he
said
well
if
you
wish
she
may
go
but
if
anything
happens
to
our
little
one
you
alone
will
be
blamed
that
settled
it
we
talked
long
after
father
and
brother
had
bade
us
good
night
mother
and
daughter
finally
retired
but
as
for
myself
i
was
nervous
and
restless
sleeping
little
thinking
of
home
and
loved
ones
not
however
forgetting
the
little
wild
rose
that
was
separated
from
me
only
by
a
curtain
partition
the
following
morning
we
were
up
at
break
of
day
and
at
just
on
a
lovely
august
morning
the
horses
were
brought
to
the
door
and
both
quickly
mounted
her
riding
habit
of
buckskin
trimmed
with
colored
beads
was
the
most
becoming
costume
i
had
ever
seen
on
her
during
my
stay
and
for
the
first
time
i
wished
that
i
were
not
going
but
it
was
for
a
moment
only
with
the
wagon
train
again
my
destination
was
denver
and
nothing
could
change
my
plans
except
death
in
the
natural
way
or
being
cut
down
by
those
treacherous
plains
roamers
after
a
pleasant
ride
which
lasted
till
noon
we
came
in
sight
of
the
corral
when
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
it
she
informed
me
she
was
going
no
farther
both
quickly
dismounted
our
conversation
would
not
interest
you
suffice
to
say
the
parting
was
painful
to
both
i
bade
her
and
she
was
off
like
a
flash
i
walked
slowly
into
camp
now
and
then
turning
to
watch
the
fast
retreating
figure
of
as
brave
a
prairie
child
as
nature
ever
produced
the
men
appeared
glad
to
see
me
the
gruff
old
wagon
boss
more
so
than
any
of
the
others
for
he
would
not
let
me
turn
my
hand
to
any
kind
of
work
until
i
was
able
then
i
did
my
best
to
repay
him
for
his
many
kindnesses
at
that
afternoon
the
train
broke
corral
and
for
the
first
time
i
realized
the
slowness
of
our
progress
and
the
long
trip
before
us
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
we
could
not
make
over
ten
miles
a
day
and
more
often
at
the
beginning
three
five
and
seven
our
bed
was
mother
earth
a
rubber
blanket
and
buffalo
robe
the
mattress
two
pairs
of
blankets
the
covering
heaven
canopy
the
roof
the
stars
our
silent
sentinels
the
days
were
warm
the
nights
cool
we
would
go
into
camp
at
sundown
the
cattle
were
unyoked
and
driven
to
water
after
grub
the
night
herder
and
one
of
the
drivers
would
take
them
in
charge
and
if
there
were
no
indians
following
would
drive
them
to
a
good
grazing
spot
over
the
bluffs
we
passed
through
kansas
after
crossing
the
little
and
big
blue
rivers
and
part
of
nebraska
without
seeing
another
log
cabin
or
woods
every
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
there
was
a
stage
station
of
the
ben
holiday
coach
line
which
ran
between
atchison
kansas
and
sacramento
california
at
every
station
would
be
a
relay
of
six
horses
and
by
driving
night
and
day
would
make
one
hundred
miles
every
hours
they
were
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
united
states
soldiers
on
top
of
coaches
and
on
horseback

a
arriving
at
fort
carney
we
struck
the
platte
river
trail
leading
to
denver
we
were
compelled
by
united
states
army
officers
to
halt
and
await
the
arrival
of
a
train
of
fifty
armed
men
before
being
allowed
to
proceed
in
a
few
hours
the
required
number
came
up
together
with
three
wagon
loads
of
pilgrims
no
train
was
permitted
to
pass
a
government
fort
without
one
hundred
men
but
once
beyond
the
fort
they
would
become
separated
and
therein
lay
the
danger
a
captain
was
appointed
by
the
commander
of
the
fort
to
take
charge
here
we
struck
the
plains
proper
or
the
great
american
desert
as
it
was
often
called
the
home
of
the
desperate
indians
degraded
and
the
squaw
man
white
men
with
indian
wives
who
were
at
that
time
either
french
or
spanish
also
the
fearless
hunters
and
trappers
with
nerves
of
steel
outdoing
the
bravest
indian
in
daring
and
the
toughest
grizzly
in
endurance
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
these
men
of
iron
were
capable
and
some
did
amputate
their
own
limbs
a
knife
sharpened
as
keen
as
a
razor
edge
would
cut
the
flesh
another
hacked
into
a
saw
would
separate
the
bones
and
sensitive
marrow
while
an
iron
heated
to
white
heat
seared
up
the
arteries
and
the
trick
was
done
there
was
no
anesthetic
in
those
days
there
were
also
the
cattle
and
mule
thieves
who
lived
in
the
bluffs
miles
from
the
trail
of
white
men
a
tough
lot
of
desperadoes
believing
in
the
adage
dead
men
tell
no
tales
there
were
the
ranchmen
at
intervals
of
twenty
fifty
and
a
hundred
miles
who
sold
to
the
pilgrims
supplies
such
as
canned
goods
playing
cards
whiskey
of
the
vilest
type
and
traded
cattle
doctored
to
look
well
for
a
few
days
and
then
give
out
thus
cheating
freighters
and
pilgrims
alike
these
adobe
ranches
were
built
of
sod
cut
in
lengths
of
from
two
to
four
feet
four
inches
in
thickness
and
eighteen
inches
in
width
and
laid
grass
side
down
the
side
walls
were
laid
either
single
or
double
six
feet
in
height
with
the
end
walls
tapering
upward
a
long
pole
was
then
placed
from
peak
to
peak
and
shorter
poles
from
side
walls
to
ridge
pole
four
inches
of
grass
covered
the
poles
and
the
same
depth
of
earth
completed
the
structure
making
the
best
fortifications
ever
devised
no
bullet
was
able
to
penetrate
their
sides
nor
could
fire
burn
them
the
poles
used
for
building
these
adobe
ranches
were
in
most
cases
hauled
two
hundred
miles
and
in
some
cases
three
hundred
miles
wild
animals
of
the
west
on
a
graceful
slope
roamed
immense
herds
of
buffalo
bands
of
elk
thousands
of
antelope
herds
of
deer
and
the
large
gray
wolf
coyotes
about
the
size
of
a
shepherd
dog
would
assemble
on
the
high
bluffs
or
invade
the
camp
and
make
night
hideous
by
their
continuous
and
almost
perfect
imitation
of
a
human
cry
making
sleep
impossible
the
prairie
dog
the
fierce
rattlesnake
and
the
beautiful
little
white
occupied
the
same
hole
in
the
ground
making
a
queer
family
combination
contrary
to
the
belief
of
all
dwellers
and
travelers
of
the
plains
in
that
day
colonel
roosevelt
claims
it
is
not
a
fact
that
the
three
mentioned
animals
occupied
the
same
quarters
together
and
that
the
story
is
a
myth
the
little
prairie
dogs
had
their
villages
the
same
as
the
indians
i
have
frequently
seen
a
prairie
dog
come
out
and
return
into
the
same
hole
in
the
ground
i
have
also
seen
a
beautiful
little
white
owl
silently
perched
at
the
side
of
the
same
hole
and
finally
enter
it
and
a
few
moments
later
a
fierce
rattlesnake
would
crawl
into
the
same
hole
whether
it
was
the
snake
permanent
abode
and
it
went
in
for
a
much
needed
rest
or
whether
it
was
an
enemy
to
the
others
and
the
snake
went
in
for
a
game
supper
of
prairie
dog
puppies
and
owl
squabs
departing
by
another
route
i
am
unable
to
say
as
i
never
took
the
trouble
to
investigate
one
of
the
holes
to
confirm
the
fact
if
i
had
i
would
in
all
probability
still
be
digging
however
in
this
case
i
am
inclined
to
give
colonel
roosevelt
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
the
reason
that
if
nature
had
not
created
an
enemy
to
check
their
increase
the
prairie
dog
would
now
the
country
as
they
multiply
faster
than
any
known
animal
and
are
very
destructive
to
the
farm
the
government
through
its
agents
have
destroyed
thousands
every
year
in
the
west
by
distributing
poisoned
grain
last
but
not
least
of
the
life
of
the
plains
was
the
pole
cat
conscious
of
his
own
ability
to
protect
himself
he
would
often
invade
the
camps
at
night
making
the
life
of
the
sleeper
miserable
trouble
en
route
after
leaving
fort
carney
our
troubles
began
many
of
the
drivers
were
as
treacherous
as
the
indians
and
would
bear
watching
one
of
them
in
our
mess
was
a
former
bushwhacker
who
bore
many
scars
of
his
former
unsavory
life
one
of
which
was
the
loss
of
an
eye
which
did
not
make
him
a
very
desirable
acquaintance
much
less
a
companion
he
was
of
an
ugly
disposition
very
seldom
speaking
to
anyone
and
very
few
taking
the
trouble
to
speak
to
him
at
times
he
acted
as
if
he
had
been
taking
something
stronger
than
coffee
but
as
we
had
not
camped
near
any
ranch
where
the
poison
could
be
procured
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
dope
fiend
in
some
mysterious
manner
we
had
lost
one
of
our
cups
and
at
each
meal
for
a
week
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
this
particular
bushwhacker
to
get
left
he
at
last
broke
his
long
silence
and
in
anger
with
oaths
vowed
he
would
not
eat
another
meal
without
a
cup
and
would
certainly
take
one
from
somebody
if
obliged
to
as
soon
as
the
call
for
grub
was
heard
the
next
morning
all
rushed
simultaneously
for
a
cup
and
bushwhacker
got
left
again
without
ceremony
he
proceeded
to
make
good
his
threat
the
second
cook
being
his
victim
trouble
en
route
for
his
trouble
he
received
a
stinging
blow
over
his
good
eye
and
was
sent
sprawling
in
the
alkali
dust
not
being
in
the
least
dismayed
he
rushed
for
another
and
received
a
similar
salute
on
the
jaw
doubling
him
up
and
bringing
him
to
the
earth
by
this
time
both
messes
joined
in
forming
a
ring
and
called
for
fair
play
perry
tried
hard
to
stop
it
but
was
finally
convinced
that
it
was
better
policy
to
let
them
have
it
out
how
many
times
the
fellow
was
knocked
down
i
do
not
remember
but
the
last
round
finished
him
we
carried
him
to
the
shady
side
of
his
wagon
covered
him
with
a
blanket
and
resumed
our
meal
on
going
into
corral
we
always
took
our
revolvers
off
and
placed
them
where
they
could
easily
be
reached
we
had
been
eating
but
a
short
time
when
the
report
of
a
gun
rang
out
and
each
man
fairly
flew
for
his
weapons
indians
seldom
made
an
attack
except
at
early
morning
when
the
oxen
were
being
yoked
or
when
we
were
going
into
corral
at
night
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
bushwhacker
had
taken
another
lease
of
life
and
with
a
revolver
in
each
hand
was
firing
at
anyone
his
disturbed
brain
suggested
he
was
quick
of
action
firing
and
reloading
with
rapidity
and
soon
had
the
entire
camp
playing
hide
and
seek
between
around
and
under
the
wagons
to
keep
out
of
the
range
of
his
guns
which
we
succeeded
in
doing
for
not
a
man
was
hit
finally
two
of
the
drivers
succeeded
in
getting
behind
him
and
overpowered
him
his
brother
bushwhackers
were
in
for
lynching
him
on
the
spot
but
wiser
council
prevailed
and
his
disposal
was
left
to
perry
who
sentenced
him
to
be
escorted
back
three
miles
from
the
corral
and
left
to
walk
the
remaining
two
miles
to
fort
carney
alone
he
covered
less
than
a
mile
when
he
was
captured
by
the
indians
i
was
obliged
then
to
drive
his
team
a
few
evenings
later
my
chum
and
friend
were
lounging
by
the
side
of
my
wagon
smoking
and
otherwise
passing
the
time
away
when
finally
the
conversation
turned
to
the
departed
driver
who
by
that
time
had
undoubtedly
been
disposed
of
by
the
indians
not
a
very
pleasant
thought
but
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
fact
that
no
one
was
to
blame
but
himself
my
chum
inquired
the
contents
of
my
prairie
schooner
and
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
but
would
investigate
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
i
crawled
in
struck
a
match
and
found
a
case
labeled
hostetters
bitters
its
ingredients
were
one
drop
of
bitters
and
the
remainder
poor
liquor
i
soon
found
a
case
that
had
been
opened
pulled
out
a
bottle
and
sampled
it
the
old
story
came
to
me
about
the
irish
saloonkeeper
and
his
bartender
i
called
my
chum
and
asked
him
if
murphy
was
good
for
a
drink
he
replied
has
he
got
it
he
has
he
is
then
and
we
all
were
i
thought
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
secret
to
be
kept
but
it
was
until
we
were
on
the
last
leg
to
denver
the
entire
load
consisted
of
cases
of
the
bitters
fights
were
of
frequent
occurrence
during
the
remainder
of
the
trip
perry
being
powerless
to
prevent
them
arriving
at
central
city
where
the
bitters
were
consigned
the
consignee
reported
to
the
freighter
that
the
load
just
received
consisted
of
bitters
the
remainder
platte
river
water
each
man
had
twenty
dollars
deducted
from
his
pay
and
a
large
number
of
the
drivers
in
addition
bore
earmarks
of
its
effect
the
country
from
fort
carney
for
four
hundred
miles
up
the
platte
river
valley
and
back
from
the
high
bluffs
that
skirted
the
river
on
either
side
was
one
vast
rolling
plain
with
no
vegetation
except
a
coarse
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
in
the
valley
near
the
river
and
beyond
the
bluffs
in
spots
that
were
not
bare
grew
the
prickly
pear
and
a
short
crisp
grass
of
lightish
color
and
of
two
varieties
the
bunch
and
buffalo
grasses
which
were
very
nutritious
as
the
cattle
thrived
and
grew
fat
on
them
there
was
the
clear
sky
and
sun
by
day
with
an
occasional
sandstorm
the
moon
when
out
and
stars
by
night
but
no
rain
a
vast
thirsty
desert
on
the
small
islands
of
the
river
a
few
scattered
cottonwood
trees
were
to
be
seen
their
high
branches
embraced
a
huge
bunch
of
something
that
resembled
the
nest
of
an
american
eagle
but
on
close
inspection
was
found
to
be
the
corpse
of
a
lone
indian
a
long
time
dead
this
was
the
mode
of
burial
of
some
of
the
tribes
in
the
early
days
using
fur
robes
or
blankets
for
a
casket
there
was
nothing
to
relieve
the
monotony
in
this
desert
land
except
desperate
indians
immense
herds
of
animal
life
daily
coaches
when
not
held
back
or
captured
by
the
indians
or
mountain
highwaymen
returning
freight
trains
and
the
following
points
where
there
were
adobe
ranches
dog
town
plum
creek
beaver

at

and

julesburg
cotton
wood
and
the
junction
each
one
hundred
miles
apart
and
john
corlew
and
william
kirby
near
bluffs
it
was
said
of
these
ranchmen
that
some
were
honest
and
some
were
not
others
were
in
league
with
the
indians
and
cattle
and
mule
thieves
and
as
a
rule
a
bad
lot
they
traded
supplies
to
the
indians
for
furs
of
every
kind
the
winter
passed
in
hunting
trapping
drinking
and
gambling
bluffs
bluffs
was
a
point
where
the
river
ran
to
the
very
foot
of
the
bluffs
making
it
necessary
for
all
of
the
trains
to
cross
then
again
strike
platte
river
trail
at
alkali
creek
the
waters
of
which
were
poisonous
to
man
and
beast
the
trail
over
the
bluffs
was
of
sand
and
those
heavily
ladened
white
covered
prairie
schooners
would
often
sink
to
the
hubs
requiring
from
fifty
to
yoke
of
oxen
to
haul
them
across
often
being
compelled
to
double
the
leading
yoke
as
far
back
as
the
wheelers
then
doubling
again
would
start
them
on
a
trot
and
with
all
in
line
and
pulling
together
would
land
the
deeply
sunken
wheels
on
solid
ground
it
took
one
entire
day
to
again
reach
river
trail
which
was
hard
and
smooth
bluffs
was
a
point
feared
by
freighters
and
emigrants
alike
at
this
point
many
a
band
of
pilgrims
met
destruction
at
the
hands
of
the
fiendish
redskins
of
the
plains
directly
upon
going
into
camp
at
night
a
party
of
them
would
ride
up
demand
coffee
whiskey
or
whatever
they
wanted
and
having
received
it
would
massacre
the
men
and
children
reserving
the
women
for
a
fate
a
thousand
fold
worse
as
they
were
very
seldom
rescued
by
the
tardy
government
whose
agents
were
supplying
the
indians
with
guns
ammunition
and
whiskey
to
carry
on
their
hellish
work
unmolested
when
captured
which
was
seldom
were
they
hung
as
they
deserved
no
the
chief
with
a
few
others
who
stood
high
in
the
councils
of
the
tribe
were
taken
by
stage
to
atchison
kansas
there
transferred
to
luxuriantly
equipped
sleeping
cars
of
that
day
and
whirled
on
to
washington
and
in

paint
and
feather
and
with
great
pomp
were
presented
to
their
great
white
father
the
president
as
they
called
him
abuses
of
the
indian
department
they
were
then
taken
in
charge
by
representatives
of
the
indian
department
of
the
government
that
in
those
days
was
honeycombed
with
corruption
from
foundation
to
dome
a
disgraceful
and
spot
in
the
nation
history
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
they
were
shown
the
sights
of
that
great
city
the
capitol
of
a
free
and
growing
republic
whose
people
respected
the
constitution
their
fathers
had
drafted
signed
and
fought
for
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
they
were
courted
dined
toasted
and
wined
until
they
had
become
sufficiently
mellow
to
be
cajoled
into
signing
another
peace
treaty
and
were
then
given
money
and
loaded
down
with
presents
as
an
inducement
to
be
good
they
were
then
returned
to
the
agency
at
the
fort
having
been
taken
from
there
and
back
by
those
indian
department
guardians
of
the
united
states
government
and
were
freely
supplied
with
whiskey
until
they
were
willing
to
part
with
their
cattle
furs
and
beaded
goods
at
extremely
low
figures
in
exchange
for
provisions
guns
ammunition
and
liquor
at
fabulously
high
prices
robbed
of
their
money
and
presents
and
in
this
condition
allowed
to
return
to
their
village
where
when
they
become
sober
they
would
quickly
awaken
to
a
realizing
sense
of
how
they
had
been
deceived
swindled
and
robbed
what
could
you
expect
from
those
savages
of
the
soil
after
such
treatment
with
no
regard
for
the
treaty
they
had
signed
they
would
resume
the
warpath

and
terrible

meted
out
to
the
innocent

had
left

sacrificed
their
lives
by
horrible
tortures
in
their
heroic
efforts

settle

that
they
were
making

with
no

with

respond
to

the

at

fluttered
high
above

protection
to
all
that
were
struggling
on

on
over

vast

you
wonder
then
that
the
unspeakable
crimes

of

still
rankle
in
the
breast
of
every

in

participated
in

you
do
look
on
the
painting
of
the
terrible
annihilation
of
the
gallant
custer

his
five
companies
of

with
the
old
chief
sitting

not
a

escaped
to
tell
the
tale

you
may
form
some
conception
of
the
hardships
suffering
and
cruelties
inflicted
on
the
early
pioneer
it
was
left
for
the
resourceful
remington
to
vividly
portray
life
and
scenes
of
those
days
perpetuating
their
memory
on
canvas
and
bronze
for
all
time
the
name
of
frederick
remington
should
not
only
go
down
in
history
as
the
greatest
living
artist
of
those
scenes
but
his
bust
in
bronze
should
be
given
a
place
in
the
hall
of
fame
as
a
tribute
to
his
life
and
a
recognition
of
his
great
worth

the
most
dismal
spot
on
the
entire
trail
its
high
walls
of
earth
and
jagged
rocks
with
openings
to
the
rolling
plain
beyond
made
it
an
ideal
point
for
the
sneaking
cowardly
savages
to
attack
the
weary
pilgrims
and
freighters
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
to
produce
a
feeling
of
gloom
and
approaching
disaster
the
emigrants
had
been
repeatedly
instructed
by
the
commander
at
fort
carney
to
corral
with
one
of
the
trains
many
of
the
bullwhackers
were
desperate
men
so
that
the
poor
pilgrims
were
in
danger
from
two
sources
and
very
seldom
camped
near
either
corral
our
consort
was
a
day
drive
in
the
rear
that
evening
the
emigrants
camped
about
a
half
mile
in
advance
of
our
train
it
was
at
this
point
when
unyoking
our
oxen
at
evening
that
a
large
band
sneaked
over
the
bluffs
for
the
purpose
as
we
supposed
of
stampeding
our
cattle
they
did
not
take
us
unawares
however
for
we
never
turned
cattle
from
corral

the
assistant

surveyed

man
stood
to

from

command

the

boss
poured
forth
with
lightning
rapidity
his
leaden
messengers
of
death
for
about
an
hour

very
interesting

us
it
was
almost
impossible
to
hit
one
as
they
kept
circling
the
camp
drawing
nearer

each
circle
made
how
many
were
killed
we
did
not
know
as
they
carried
them

from

riderless
ponies
a
dozen
or
more
must
have
been
dispatched
to

happy

down

watching
their
opportunity
to

us
at
early
morning
by
signal
arrows

fire
shot
into
the
heavens

make
known

outrages
inflicted
on
innocent

the

even
more
dangerous
trail
of

smoky

give
up
its
secrets
it
would
reveal
a
dark
page
in
the
history
of
our
government
which
was
directly
responsible
for
a
great
deal
of
it
responsible
in
so
far
as
sending
unscrupulous
peace
commissioners
to
the
different
agencies
to
make
treaties
of
peace
with
tribes
of
indians
and
who
kept
them
just
long
enough
to
become
liberally
supplied
with
provisions
clothing
guns
ammunition
and
whiskey

ravish
and

the
most
diabolical

all
that
remained

was

the
fiends

to
readers
of
fiction
as
the
noble
red
men
of
the
plains
more
dastardly
cowards
never
existed
their
struggles
against
destiny
have
long
since
been
broken
and
the
offspring
of
those
cruel
warriors
are
being
educated
by
a
gracious
government
the
monotony
of
that
lonesome
and
tedious
tramp
was
enlivened
only
by
fights
among
the
men
and
an
occasional
for
a
day
to
set
the
tires
of
the
many
wagons
having
had
no

them
tight

bearing
scars

from

we
tramped
along
in
moccasin
covered
feet

and
again

our
long
lashed
whips
with
such
force
as
to
awaken
the
ox

quicker
action

passed

with
the
loss
of

three
men
arriving
late
at
night
after
a
forced
drive
at
the
junction

division
of
the
two
trails
leading
to

the
distance
to
denver
by
the
was
miles
by
the
river

one
hundred
miles
but
as
water
was
to
be
found
only
at
long
distances
on
the
former

trains
took
the
river
route
it
was
early
in
november
the
nights
and
mornings
were
cold
and
frosty
the
air
exhilarating
we
were
up
the
next
morning
at
the
usual
time
and
as
the
sun
rose
in
all
its
splendor
and
warmth
one
hundred
miles
in
the
far
away
distance
could
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
the
gigantic
range
of
the
rockies
whose
lofty
peaks
sparkling
in
the
morning
sun
seemed
to
soar
and
pierce
the
clouds
of
delicate
shades
that
floated
in
space
about
them
attracted
as
it
were
by
a
heavenly
magnet
it
was
a
sight
i
had
not
dreamed
of
and
one
that
made
an
impression
on
my
young
mind
to
last
through
life
denver
at
last
when
about
ten
miles
from
denver
so
we
at
least
thought
and
fearless
of
danger
my
chum
and
myself
obtained
permission
from
perry
to
walk
to
the
city
over
the
rolling
ground
we
tramped
until
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
heavens
one
would
think
it
but
a
few
miles
to
those
mighty
and
solemn
mountains
of
rocks
so
deceptive
was
the
distance
yet
they
were
twenty
miles
beyond
the
city
at
noon
we
knew
we
had
made
ten
long
miles
and
were
completely
tired
out
we
were
on
the
point
of
taking
a
rest
when
i
urged
my
chum
to
cross
the
next
knoll
and
if
the
city
did
not
loom
up
we
would
halt
we
did
so
and
to
our
surprise
and
joy
were
right
in
the
city
of
denver
the
mecca
of
nearly
all
western
freighters
and
distributing
point
for
the
far
western
territories
it
seemed
to
have
risen
beneath
our
feet
the
grand
old
range
of
mountains
with
their
pinnacles
and
scenic
background
of
grandeur
together
with
the
surrounding
landscape
made
it
the
sight
of
one
life
our
sixteen
mile
walk
and
previous
seventy
days
living
on
a
diet
of
bacon
beans
and
dried
apples
certainly
placed
us
in
condition
for
a
civilized
meal
we
were
directed
to
a
restaurant
both
in
price
and
quality
of
food
we
were
about
famished
and
to
satisfy
our
hunger
seemed
impossible
we
ate
and
ate
and
probably
would
have
been
eating
yet
had
not
the
waiter
presented
us
with
a
ticket
demanding
a
five
dollar
gold
piece
from
each
when
we
decided
we
had
better
call
a
halt
if
we
intended
to
remain
in
the
city
over
night
an
old
acquaintance
on
walking
up
the
street
we
stepped
into
the
first
hotel
we
came
to
the
old
planters
registered
paid
for
our
supper
lodging
and
breakfast
when
about
to
leave
the
hotel
who
should
walk
in
but
a
genevan
by
name
michael
pembroke
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
he
had
been
propelled
across
the
plains
by
mules
and
one
of
the
ugly
brutes
had
broken
his
right
arm
with
one
of
his
ever
active
hoofs
i
asked
michael
why
the
mule
kicked
him
he
replied
charlie
i
may
look
foolish
but
was
not
fool
enough
to
go
back
and
ask
him
never
approach
a
missouri
mule
from
the
rear
for
there
certainly
will
be
trouble
if
you
do
he
asked
if
we
had
any
money
we
replied
that
we
would
have
when
paid
off
he
advised
us
to
go
direct
to
the
ben
holiday
stage
office
and
buy
a
ticket
for
the
states
as
soon
as
we
received
our
pay
as
colorado
was
no
place
for
boys
illustration
michael
pembroke
at
his
suggestion
we
started
out
to
do
the
town
and
came
very
near
being
done
ourselves
colorado
at
this
time
was
a
territory
with
a
governor
appointed
by
the
president
law
except
as
executed
by
a
vigilance
committee
did
not
amount
to
much
more
than
the
word
if
one
wished
to
depart
life
in
full
dress
he
could
be
accommodated
by
simply
calling
another
a
liar
or
cheat
at
gambling
if
desirous
of
taking
a
long
rest
by
being
suspended
by
the
neck
from
a
limb
of
the
only
tree
in
denver
at
that
time
which
was
on
the
west
side
of
cherry
creek
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
appropriate
to
himself
an
ox
mule
or
anything
of
value
and
the
vigilance
committee
would
manipulate
the
rope
the
gambling
places
which
occupied
long
halls
on
the
ground
floor
of
tall
buildings
nearly
always
on
the
business
street
of
the
city
kept
open
until
the
small
hours
of
morning
there
was
always
a
brass
band
in
front
and
a
string
band
or
orchestra
in
the
extreme
rear
so
if
one
wished
to
dance
he
could
select
a
partner
of
most
any
nationality
dance
a
set
step
up
to
the
bar
pay
two
bits
or
cents
for
cigars
drinks
or
both
and
expend
his
balance
on
any
game
known
to
the
profession
which
games
occupied
either
side
of
the
long
room
we
had
been
in
the
place
less
than
fifteen
minutes
when
bang
went
a
revolver
and
on
the
instant
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
i
mechanically
ducked
under
a
table
where
my
companions
were
i
knew
not
i
began
to
think
that
mike
advice
was
about
correct
and
before
emerging
wished
more
than
once
i
was
back
in
my
home
when
the
lights
were
turned
on
i
discovered
my
chum
occupying
a
like
berth
of
safety
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
mike
had
evidently
followed
his
own
advice
and
taken
his
departure
for
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found

to
fly
and
if
i
had
not
passed
through
the
ordeal
i
never
would
have
known
anything
had
happened
the
dead
were
quickly
disposed
of
the
wounded
hurried
to
physicians
and
old
timers
gave
it
no
further
thought
as
it
was
of
frequent
occurrence
and
one
soon
became
hardened
denver
at
that
time
was
a
hotbed
of
gambling
with
murder
and
lynch
law
a
secondary
pastime
not
being
deterred
by
our
experience
we
continued
our
sightseeing
ending
up
at
the
only
theatre
in
the
city
afterwards
called
the
old
languish
joining
the
cattle
train
again
the
following
afternoon
our
train
reached
town
and
we
joined
it
during
the
evening
to
be
ready
for
an
early
start
for
golden
city
the
entrance
to
the
mountains
leading
to
black
hawk
and
central
city
where
our
freight
was
consigned
the
most
hazardous
part
of
our
trip
was
before
us
one
that
to
this
day
makes
me
shiver
when
i
think
of
it
the
first
team
entered
the
canyon
at
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
the
road
for
nearly
the
entire
distance
was
hewn
from
solid
rock
out
of
the
side
of
steep
mountains
gradually
ascending
to
a
great
height
then
descending
to
what
seemed
a
bottomless
canyon
we
finally
arrived
at
guy
hill
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
route
it
took
us
one
entire
day
to
reach
its
pinnacle
where
we
camped
for
the
night
the
road
at
the
top
was
cut
through
solid
rock
at
a
height
of
twenty
feet
seven
feet
in
width
and
led
to
a
steep
precipice
it
then
made
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
and
in
a
serpent
shape
drive
continued
to
the
canyon
below
at
this
point
it
was
said
to
be
fifteen
hundred
feet
straight
down
and
a
number
of
outfits
had
previously
gone
over
its
rocky
edge
and
been
hurled
to
destruction
by
a
slight
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
driver
the
cold
and
snow
together
with
summer
clothing
made
our
suffering
indescribable
the
following
morning
i
started
in
the
lead
of
the
train
with
a
nine
thousand
pound
boiler
with
the
rear
wheels
securely
locked
and
twenty
yoke
of
oxen
to
haul
it
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
then
discarding
all
but
the
wheelers
and
leaders
we
began
the
descent
there
was
not
room
enough
on
either
side
for
the
driver
to
walk
he
generally
rode
the
off
ox
but
i
took
my
position
on
the
rear
of
the
wagon
tongue
and
found
it
decidedly
the
safest
place
in
case
of
an
accident
by
night
all
wagons
were
safely
in
the
canyon
below
the
road
for
nearly
the
entire
distance
presented
the
same
dangers
taking
ten
days
to
reach
our
destination
from
denver
the
entire
trip
occupying
eighty
days
a
thrilling
coach
ride
on
receiving
our
pay
which
was
our
promised
salary
less
twenty
dollars
for
the
hostetter
bitters
my
chum
and
myself
decided
to
go
direct
to
denver
our
friend
remaining
in
the
mountain
city
we
boarded
a
concord
coach
with
six
horses
to
wheel
us
on
a
dead
run
over
and
around
steep
mountains
and
through
dismal
canyons
first
on
four
wheels
then
three
then
two
and
occasionally
one
keeping
us
constantly
busy
retaining
our
seats
and
fearing
at
every
turn
that
we
would
be
dashed
into
eternity
and
yet
it
was
one
of
the
most
picturesque
and
thrilling
rides
one
could
take
being
tossed
from
side
to
side
in
the
roomy
coach
now
and
then
grabbing
a
fellow
passenger
with
desperation
gazing
down
from
lofty
peaks
to
yawning
chasms
below
hearing
the
crack
of
the
whip
urging
the
noble
steeds
to
faster
speed
turning
the
rough
ragged
drive
thundering
through
clouds
and
mist
with
lightning
rapidity
and
always
in
constant
terror
of
a
breakdown
or
error
on
the
part
of
the
fearless
driver
gave
one
a
sensation
that
would
nearly
make
his
hair
stand
on
end
during
the
descent
a
slight
error
on
the
part
of
the
horses
or
driver
would
have
hurled
all
to
a
horrible
death
but
those
mountain
drivers
strapped
to
their
seats
were
monarchs
of
the
rockies
and
unerring
in
every
move
from
among
the
glaciers
sparkling
in
the
morning
sun
emitting
the
many
tints
of
a
midday
and
presenting
a
sight
of
unsurpassed
grandeur
we
emerged
from
the
mouth
of
the
last
canyon
and
struck
the
smooth
rolling
trail
all
the
way
from
golden
we
were
going
it
seemed
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
were
landed
in
denver

in

was
appropriately
called

here
it
stood
a
typical

town
a
monument
to
the
indomitable
energy
of
man
in
his
efforts
to
settle
that
barren
and
almost
endless

were

which
kept
one
partially
in
touch
with
happenings
in
the
faraway
states
isolated
from

it
was
an
ideal
place
of
refuge
for
those
anxious
to
escape
the
outraged

desperadoes
made
one
attempt
to
lay
the
city
in
ashes
and
certainly
would
have
accomplished
their
purpose
had
it
not
been
for
the
timely
action
of
the
vigilance
committee
in
hanging
the
when
the
guilt
of
a
suspect
for
any
crime
was
in
doubt
he
was
presented
with
a
horse
or
mule
and
ordered
to
leave
between
sun
and
sun
and
never
return
during
my
four
years
of
residence
in
denver
there
was
but
one
indian
scare
and
it
made
a
lasting
impression
on
the
tablet
of
my
memory
a
church
bell
pealed
forth
the
warning
over
the
thirsty
desert
of
an
indian
attack
business
places
were
closed
the
women
and
children
were
rushed
to
the
mint
and
warehouses
for
protection
armed
men
surrounded
the
city
pickets
on
horseback
were
thrown
out
in
every
direction
couriers
kept
thundering
back
and
forth
between
picket
line
and
those
in
command
and
others
were
despatched
to
the
different
forts
for
assistance
that
never
came
a
look
of
determination
stood
out
on
the
face
of
every
one
and
not
a
man
from
clergyman
to
desperado
within
the
confines
of
the
city
who
would
not
willingly
have
given
up
his
life
blood
to
protect
the
honor
of
the
women
and
lives
of
the
little
ones
for
three
weary
days
and
the
same
number
of
nights
the
terrible
suspense
lasted
but
no
indian
came
it
was
a
false
alarm
denver
in
its
early
settlement
was
never
attacked
by
the
indians
except
in
isolated
cases
the
only
reason
that
i
ever
heard
given
for
their
not
doing
so
was
that
they
knew
not
their
strength
for
there
was
no
time
in
the
sixties
that
they
could
not
have
swooped
down
on
the
place
massacred
all
and
buried
the
little
mining
town
in
ashes
secured
work
again
for
a
young
man
to
obtain
work
other
than
oxen
or
mule
driving
we
were
told
was
simply
impossible
not
being
deterred
however
by
this
discouraging
information
we
at
once
started
out
to
secure
work
board
was
dollars
a
week
in
gold
and
you
had
to
furnish
your
own
sleeping
quarters
so
not
to
secure
work
at
once
would
quickly
reduce
our
wealth
we
had
called
on
nearly
all
of
the
business
places
when
my
chum
secured
a
position
with
a
grocer
and
freighter
as
for
myself
i
received
little
encouragement
but
finally
called
at
a
large
restaurant
where
i
was
offered
work
i
told
the
proprietor
it
was
a
little
out
of
my
line
but
he
told
me
that
if
i
could
not
find
a
position
to
suit
me
i
should
walk
in
at
any
time
pull
off
my
coat
and
go
to
work
which
i
did
three
days
later
about
the
tenth
day
the
proprietor
told
me
his
lease
expired
and
that
the
man
who
owned
the
building
was
going
to
conduct
the
business
he
came
in
that
afternoon
and
i
was
introduced
to
him
before
leaving
he
stepped
into
the
office
and
informed
me
that
he
wanted
a
man
next
to
him
or
in
other
words
an
assistant
and
that
the
former
proprietor
had
given
me
a
good
recommend
and
he
thought
that
i
would
suit
him
he
made
me
a
tempting
offer
and
i
accepted
the
restaurant
was
located
on
blake
street
one
of
the
then
principal
business
streets
of
the
city
and
kept
open
until
early
morning
as
did
the
gambling
places
in
the
immediate
vicinity
i
soon
discovered
that
the
new
proprietor
could
neither
read
or
write
and
that
he
conducted
one
of
the
largest
private
club
rooms
in
the
city
where
gambling
was
carried
on
without
limit
he
paid
me
a
large
salary
and
allowed
me
everything
my
wild
nature
craved
i
had
charge
of
the
entire
business
as
well
as
his
bank
account
the
restaurant
was
the
headquarters
of
nearly
all
oxen
and
mule
drivers
and
also
of
the
miners
who
came
from
the
mountains
in
winter
and
were
of
the
toughest
type
of
men
of
that
day
all
professional
oxen
and
mule
drivers
after
making
one
round
trip
to
the
river
and
points
in
the
far
western
territories
were
paid
off
in
denver
and
many
of
them
would
deposit
with
me
for
safe
keeping
a
large
share
of
their
dangerously
and
hard
earned
dollars
they
would
then
start
out
to
do
the
town
now
and
then
taking
a
chance
at
one
of
the
many
gambling
games
always
returning
for
more
money
which
i
would
give
them
and
this
they
would
continue
until
all
was
expended
except
enough
to
keep
them
a
week
when
sober
and
a
commission
for
doing
the
business
for
which
i
was
careful
to
look
out
an
individual
who
bore
the
name
of
one
eye
jack
boarded
with
us
and
i
could
always
depend
upon
him
in
time
of
trouble
his
vocation
for
a
long
time
was
a
mystery
until
one
evening
as
i
was
passing
down
a
side
street
he
popped
out
from
an
alley
and
with
uplifted
blackjack
would
have
felled
and
robbed
me
had
he
not
recognized
the
unearthly
yell
i
gave
i
forgave
him
and
afterwards
he
doubled
his
energies
to
protect
me
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
saved
my
life
when
in
his
professional
clothes
he
was
a
tough
looking
customer
and
could
fight
like
a
bull
dog
he
was
always
liberally
supplied
with
someone
else
money
yet
with
all
his
bad
traits
his
word
was
as
good
as
his
gold
but
like
other
similar
individuals
that
infested
denver
at
that
time
he
finally
went
to
the
end
of
his
tether
and
was
presented
by
the
vigilance
committee
with
a
hemp
collar
that
deprived
him
of
his
life
before
his
demise
however
a
party
of
ten
individuals
entered
the
restaurant
and
in
forceful
language
demanded
the
best
the
country
offered
in
eatables
and
drink
my
friend
or
was
in
at
the
time
and
i
noticed
a
look
of
cunning
pleasure
steal
over
his
rough
countenance
the
strangers
were
dressed
in
corduroy
trousers
velveteen
coats
slouch
hats
and
black
ties
their
shirts
and
collars
of
red
flannel
made
a
conspicuous
appearance
and
caused
their
undoing
later
after
seeing
them
well
cared
for
i
returned
to
the
office
and
calling
jack
inquired
his
opinion
of
the
gents
well
he
replied
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
will
just
bet
you
a
ten
spot
they
are
road
agents
yes
i
said
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
but
keep
mum
you
may
think
it
strange
i
did
not
give
this
bold
highwayman
away
but
life
in
those
days
was
sweet
and
i
had
no
desire
to
have
that
young
life
taken
so
i
followed
commanche
bill
advice
and
strictly
minded
my
own
business

i
had
not

would
not
be

one
of

his
head
done
up
in
a
bandage
from
words
he
dropped
i
was
satisfied
that
jack
or
one
of
his
cronies
had
been
improving
their
spare
time
by
relieving
him
of
his
over
abundance
of
gold
the
reckless
manner
in
which
they
disposed
of
their
money
and
their
conversation
when
flushed
with
wine
betrayed
their
true
characters
and
stamped
them
a
murderous
band
of
mountain
highwaymen
who
had
made
their
headquarters
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
rockies
near
the
overland
mountain
trail
and
there
devoted
their
time
to
holding
up
stage
coaches
compelling
the
driver
with
a
shot
from
a
carbine
to
halt
descend
disarm
and
be

were
then
ordered
to
alight
and
stand
in
a
row
continually
being
covered
with
guns
by
a
part
of
the
band
and
by
others
relieved
of
their
personal
effects

the
stage
coach
was
systematically
gone
through
together
with
the
wells
fargo

which
often
contained
gold
into

thousands
these
were
not
infrequent
and
were
the
fear
of
all
who
were
obliged
to
pass
through
these
canyons
of
robbery
and
often

the
bunch
that
we
harbored
were
undoubtedly
as
bold

robbers
and
murderers
as
ever
infested

silent
caves

dingy
walls
but
talk
they
would
reveal
crimes
unspeakable
i
knew
there
were
many
strangers
in
town
and
was
almost
certain
their
every
movement
was
watched
nor
was
i
mistaken
the
seventh
day
after
their
arrival
a
young
school
teacher
whom
i
knew
by
sight
called
at
the
restaurant
and
inquired
by
name
for
one
of
the
band
i
asked
if
he
knew
him
he
replied
no
more
than
that
he
had
met
him
in
one
of
the
corrals
of
the
city
and
had
been
offered
free

told
him
of
my
suspicions
and
all
i
knew
about
them
and
advised
him
not
to
go
with
them
but
like
many
others
he
gave
no
heed
two
days
later
they
were
missed
at

word
came

new
employment
i
remained
with
the
restaurant
keeper
one
year
when
through
the
assistance
of
influential
men
that
boarded
at
the
restaurant
i
secured
a
position
with
a
grocer
shortly
after
entering
his
employ
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
officer
a
graduate
of
west
point
and
a
well
educated
man
who
afterwards
became
my
boon
companion
at
that
time
he
was
an
merchant
from
cincinnati
an
eccentric
old
fellow
without
chick
or
child
and
with
plenty
of
money
to
loan
at
a
month
he
owned
a
large
warehouse
on
cherry
creek
in
west
denver
where
he
slept
and
did
his
own
cooking
his
evenings
were
passed
at
the
store
and
many
were
the
nights
that
we
told
stories
and
otherwise
enjoyed
ourselves
he
was
a
silent
member
of
the
firm
and
i
was
wise
enough
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
him
during
that
time
the
head
of
the
firm
ran
for
congress
on
the
democratic
ticket
such
an
election
i
never
want
to
see
or
go
through
again
large
wagons
loaded
with
barrels
of
all
kinds
of
liquor
on
tap
were
driven
from
poll
to
poll
many
more
ballots
were
cast
in
each
precinct
than
there
were
voters
and
by
night
nearly
the
entire
male
portion
of
the
inhabitants
were
a
drunken
howling
mass
the
outcome
of
the
election
resulted
in
the
governor
giving
the
democratic
nominee
the
certificate
of
election
the
secretary
of
the
territory
favoring
the
republicans
the
governor
left
the
city
that
night
and
never
returned
the
contest
terminated
in
a
republican
congress
seating
the
republican
candidate
and
andrew
johnson
then
president
of
the
united
states
appointing
the
democratic
candidate
governor
of
colorado
a
year
from
that
time
general
grant
was
inaugurated
and
shortly
afterwards
the
head
went
into
the
basket
and
mine
fell
on
the
outside
on
another
occasion
there
was
to
be
a
prize
fight
at
golden
city
sixteen
miles
from
denver
my
friend
the
merchant
i
could
see
was
anxious
to
attend
but
did
not
wish
to
lower
his
standard
of
dignity
by
doing
so
so
the
subject
was
not
mentioned
save
in
a
casual
way
until
the
morning
of
the
fight
when
he
entered
the
store
puffing
and
blowing
stamping
the
floor
with
his
hickory
cane
and
mopping
his
crimson
brow
with
an
bandana
handkerchief
said
charley
let
go
to
that
infernal
fight
i
do
approve
of
it
but
let
go
all
right
i
said
i
was
in
for
any
kind
of
sport
an
experience
in
mule
riding
i
left
everything
locked
the
store
and
started
out
to
procure
a
rig
but
found
there
were
none
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
the
only
article
of
propulsion
we
could
hire
were
saddle
mules
both
quickly
mounted
and
on
a
slow
trot
started
for
the
ring
we
had
been
there
less
than
an
hour
when
both
of
us
became
thoroughly
disgusted
and
started
on
the
return
trip
when
about
seven
miles
from
denver
and
going
at
a
lively
pace
for
a
mule
the
major
animal
stiffened
both
front
legs
and
placing
his
hoofs
firmly
in
the
sandy
road
permitted
the
major
chunky
little
body
to
pass
over
his
head
and
through
space
for
about
ten
feet
landing
with
much
force
on
his
stomach
the
old
fellow
was
an
artist
at
curse
words
and
the
more
i
laughed
the
more
he
cursed
he
was
a
sprightly
little
fellow
and
on
gaining
his
feet
grabbed
for
the
bridle
but
mule
shook
his
head
made
a
side
step
and
the
devil
could
not
have
caught
him
again
until
he
reached
the
barn
i
dismounted
and
with
much
difficulty
my
friend
scrambled
into
my
saddle
with
myself
on
behind
but
my
critter
objected
and
the
fun
commenced
he
bunted
and
kicked
all
of
a
sudden
his
hind
quarters
rose
and
like
lightning
his
long
lanky
legs
shot
high
into
the
air
first
i
went
off
and
on
gaining
a
sitting
position
with
mouth
ears
and
eyes
full
of
sand
i
witnessed
a
spectacle
befitting
the
clumsiest
bareback
rider
on
one
of
their
first
lessons
the
old
major
had
both
arms
affectionately
entwined
around
the
mule
thick
neck
and
was
hanging
on
with
desperation
up
and
down
went
the
hind
quarters
of
that
unkind
brute
bunting
and
kicking
the
major
little
body
keeping
taps
with
the
ups
and
downs
and
every
time
he
caught
his
breath
he
let
out
a
war
whoop
that
would
do
credit
to
a
commanche
brave
the
old
mule
finally
dumped
him
all
in
a
heap
and
followed
his
mate
to
denver
such
an
appearance
as
both
presented
each
blaming
the
other
for
our
misfortune
and
vowing
we
would
never
be
caught
at
another
prize
fight
lame
bruised
and
crestfallen
we
walked
the
remainder
of
the
way
into
denver
each
cautioned
the
other
to
say
nothing
of
our
misfortune
but
the
two
mauds
had
carried
the
news
ahead
and
we
were
the
laughing
stock
of
the
town
for
the
next
nine
days
illustration
returning
from
prize
fight
at
another
time
i
was
attending
a
performance
in
the
old
languish
theater
when
from
the
stage
i
was
informed
i
was
wanted
in
the
bar
room
of
the
building
a
necessary
adjunct
to
all
western
theaters
in
those
days
upon
entering
i
was
taken
by
the
hand
by
one
of
those
trusty
and
stage
drivers
of
the
plains
and
rockies
and
told
that
my
chum
had
been
caught
in
one
of
those
treacherous
mountain
snow
storms
on
the
catchla
purder
river
two
miles
above
la
port
and
was
badly
frozen
and
if
he
did
receive
medical
aid
at
once
could
not
survive
i
left
the
theater
at
once
and
commenced
preparing
plans
for
the
trip
i
started
unaccompanied
the
following
afternoon
at
on
a
one
hundred
fifty
mile
ride
a
ride
in
a
storm
my
conveyance
was
a
long
buggy
the
buggy
which
was
well
filled
with
straw
blankets
medicine
grub
and
a
commissary
bottle
had
two
good
roadsters
hitched
in
front
to
wheel
me
to
the
rescue
of
my
friend
or
to
an
ignominious
death
i
had
not
only
indians
to
fear
but
the
treacherous
elements
the
trail
ran
close
along
the
base
of
the
mountains
it
was
a
lovely
may
day
i
was
obliged
to
make
miles
that
night
to
reach
cover
less
than
half
of
the
distance
had
been
traveled
when
the
wind
veered
suddenly
to
the
north
mild
at
first
then
a
hurricane
of
anger
roaring
and
blowing
with
such
force
as
to
nearly
upset
the
buggy
dark
clouds
gathered
and
floated
around
those
silent
peaks
of
ages
lightning
darted
hither
and
thither
among
the
stalwart
pines
which
were
creaking
bending
and
crashing
clap
after
clap
of
thunder
pealed
through
and
from
those
dismal
canyons
vibrating
between
nature
slopes
of
granite
quartz
and
rock
the
din
was
fearful
rain
fell
at
first
then
turned
to
snow
just
before
it
became
dark
i
adjusted
the
front
piece
of
the
buggy
my
compass
was
useless
i
urged
my
faithful
steeds
to
faster
speed
and
at
the
same
time
gave
them
the
rein
as
i
did
so
they
left
the
trail
cold
and
chilled
to
the
marrow
or
very
bone
i
took
frequent
drafts
from
the
commissary
bottle
and
fought
with
all
my
power
against
sleep
but
it
was
useless
on
gaining
partial
consciousness
two
squaws
were
bending
over
me
rubbing
me
with
all
their
indian
strength
and
a
third
forcing
something
warm
down
my
throat
men
rough
of
dress
were
smoking
and
playing
cards
revolvers
chips
and
gold
was
in
front
of
each
with
plenty
of
the
latter
in
the
center
of
the
table
i
knew
not
if
they
were
friends
or
mountain
highwaymen
many
claim
that
horses
are
dumb
brutes
with
no
instinct
but
that
faithful
pair
on
leaving
the
trail
avoided
a
long
bend
and
made
straight
for
the
adobe
stage
ranch
sixteen
miles
away
on
reaching
it
they
ran
the
through
the
only
opening
of
that
mud
shack
rousing
the
inmates
to
action
and
bringing
me
to
safety
the
large
concord
coach
filled
with
passengers
soon
arrived
from
denver
and
owing
to
the
severity
of
the
storm
put
up
for
the
night
the
time
was
passed
in
smoking
drinking
and
playing
cards
at
six
the
next
morning
the
coach
pulled
up
at
the
door
the
storm
was
over
but
not
the
wind
the
cold
was
intense
my
team
soon
came
up
but
their
ears
and
noses
were
badly
frost
bitten
and
otherwise
showed
the
effects
of
the
storm
i
followed
the
coach
but
for
a
short
distance
only
as
the
snow
which
was
drifting
badly
obliterated
the
trail
the
six
black
horses
on
the
coach
were
too
much
for
my
two
bays
and
soon
left
me
far
in
the
rear
my
compass
had
been
lost
and
by
noon
i
was
back
at
the
ranch
i
had
previously
left
the
horses
having
made
nearly
a
complete
circle
without
my
knowledge
i
secured
another
compass
and
at
nine
that
evening
rolled
into
la
port
a
city
of
adobe
ranches
and
stage
station
where
i
put
up
for
the
night
a
place
of
two
or
three
houses
in
those
days
was
called
a
city
i
was
informed
that
my
chum
was
two
miles
up
the
river
and
in
bad
shape
the
next
morning
i
was
up
at
day
break
after
grub
i
started
and
found
my
companion
quartered
in
a
little
old
log
cabin
at
the
base
of
the
mountains
and
being
cared
for
by
an
aged
squaw
and
her
daughter
the
old
buck
being
out
caring
for
the
cattle
my
chum
had
encountered
the
same
kind
of
a
storm
as
his
rescuer
and
unable
to
find
his
way
was
obliged
to
remain
out
the
entire
night
and
only
one
hundred
feet
from
the
cabin
both
of
his
feet
were
badly
frozen
the
indians
had
done
everything
possible
for
him
the
daughter
for
an
indian
was
extremely
pretty
and
i
soon
discovered
that
she
was
very
much
taken
with
my
chum
i
applied
the
remedies
which
i
had
brought
then
the
little
indian
maiden
bundled
him
up
and
with
the
promise
that
he
would
return
they
parted
we
were
at
once
off
on
the
return
trip
and
arrived
at
the
stage
ranch
where
i
was
cared
for
the
previous
night
at
just
six
on
driving
up
to
the
door
of
the
station
all
three
of
the
reaches
of
the
buggy
broke
and
gently
dropped
us
to
the
ground
fortunately
there
was
a
blacksmith
connected
with
the
station
and
i
assisted
him
through
the
long
night
forging
reaches
and
repairing
the
buggy
at
daylight
we
were
off
reaching
denver
in
safety
at
that
afternoon
and
making
the
trip
in
just
three
days
both
of
my
chum
feet
had
to
be
amputated
at
the
insteps
he
was
very
grateful
and
quite
conscious
of
the
fact
that
true
friendship
still
existed
before
leaving
the
governor
employ
i
accompanied
a
mule
train
of
ten
wagons
with
supplies
for
the
ute
tribe
of
indians
who
lived
in
one
of
the
parks
of
the
mountains
in
the
vicinity
of
pike
peak
the
utes
at
that
particular
time
were
on
friendly
terms
with
the
white
men
as
there
was
a
treaty
of
peace
existing
between
them
and
the
government
chapter
v
a
proof
of
marksmanship
illustration
w
we
took
with
us
a
baker
who
was
conceded
to
be
one
of
the
best
guides
hunters
trappers
and
interpreters
of
that
day
with
a
heart
as
large
as
an
american
bison
and
as
tender
as
a
child
but
when
his
anger
was
aroused
by
danger
or
treachery
the
very
devil
seemed
to
possess
him
he
had
the
courage
of
a
lion
and
was
a
dead
shot
we
had
been
friends
for
a
long
time
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
proved
a
true
one
the
park
was
an
ideal
summer
resort
an
extended
plateau
with
acres
of
fresh
green
grass
wild
flowers
and
virgin
soil
in
the
center
was
a
beautiful
lake
its
ice
cold
water
well
stocked
with
the
finny
tribe
of
speckled
mountain
trout
the
delight
of
the
angler
the
park
was
inclosed
by
mountains
of
great
height
and
grandeur
their
rocky
slopes
were
dotted
with
spruce
pine
and
cottonwood
and
capped
with
ages
of
crystal
snow
presenting
a
sight
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
than
the
falls
of
niagara
and
a
perfect
haven
for
an
indian
maiden
love
dream
we
had
been
in
camp
but
a
few
days
when
baker
informed
me
that
the
young
bucks
as
the
men
of
the
tribe
were
called
wanted
us
to
join
in
shooting
at
a
target
after
baker
and
myself
had
made
a
few
eyes
they
proposed
we
two
should
choose
sides
and
we
did
so
the
teams
were
very
evenly
matched
making
the
game
interesting
in
the
meantime
i
had
been
presented
to
the
chief
in
true
indian
fashion
and
in
turn
was
made
known
by
him
to
his
squaw
young
bucks
and
maidens
the
indians
had
their
tribal
laws
and
customs
as
well
as
the
white
man
and
were
required
to
live
up
to
them
the
maidens
were
two
in
number
their
ages
fourteen
and
seventeen
moons
respectively
the
latter
a
picture
of
indian
beauty
perfect
in
every
feature
form
and
carriage
a
rare
model
for
an
artist
they
were
nearly
always
found
together
at
first
they
were
quite
reserved
but
finally
we
became
fast
friends
we
would
ramble
hunt
fish
from
canoes
and
sail
the
placid
waters
of
the
little
lake
early
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
day
baker
entered
my
tent
with
a
troubled
look
i
bade
him
and
inquired
the
cause
without
fencing
he
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
be
a
squaw
man
i
asked
him
what
the
devil
he
was
getting
at
an
offer
of
matrimony
he
replied
all
there
is
to
it
the
old
chief
has
taken
a
great
liking
to
you
and
wants
you
to
marry
weenouah
his
oldest
daughter
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
his
horses
and
cattle
run
into
four
figures
that
is
no
inducement
i
said
and
it
could
never
be
baker
asked
how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
it
i
replied
i
have
been
in
lots
of
tight
places
as
you
know
and
have
always
managed
to
squeeze
through
and
i
get
out
of
this
one
in
some
way
little
did
either
of
us
dream
at
that
time
of
the
manner
or
rather
the
sacrifice
that
one
of
us
was
doomed
to
bear
for
me
to
escape
the
wrath
of
the
old
chief
when
informed
i
would
not
marry
his
daughter
fate
decreed
he
was
never
to
be
so
informed
but
instead
a
most
cruel
and
unfortunate
accident
was
to
provide
the
means
that
afternoon
the
young
bucks
were
again
anxious
to
test
their
skill
at
the
target
we
all
used
the
same
carbine
which
contained
seven
cartridges
one
in
the
gun
barrel
and
six
in
a
magazine
in
the
butt
of
the
gun
baker
and
i
always
tossed
up
a
pebble
to
see
who
had
first
shot
as
baker
won
the
first
chance
he
took
aim
and
pulled
the
trigger
and
such
an
explosion
as
took
place
will
never
be
forgotten
everyone
was
stunned
by
its
force
when
the
smoke
had
cleared
poor
baker
body
was
found
lying
on
the
ground
with
the
lower
jaw
torn
from
its
place
on
recovering
from
the
shock
the
young
bucks
fairly
flew
for
the
indian
medicine
man
i
quickly
reached
the
corral
and
informed
the
wagon
boss
of
the
accident
he
at
once
ordered
the
mules
brought
up
the
light
wagon
was
supplied
with
straw
blankets
commissary
bottle
and
grub
six
of
the
fastest
mules
were
hitched
to
the
wagon
and
selecting
two
of
the
mulewhackers
gave
instruction
for
his
care
en
route
i
took
the
lines
and
quickly
drove
to
the
spot
where
poor
baker
had
fallen
just
as
soon
as
the
flow
of
blood
had
been
checked
and
his
wounds
dressed
we
raised
him
gently
and
placed
him
in
the
wagon
without
a
word
i
mounted
the
driver
box
and
drove
for
all
there
was
in
those
six
mules
reaching
denver
late
the
following
night
some
who
read
this
narrative
may
be
skeptical
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
that
poor
baker
recovered
for
i
saw
him
a
year
later
but
he
could
partake
of
liquid
food
only
the
once
stalwart
form
of
that
brave
man
now
emaciated
and
wasted
to
a
mere
skeleton
still
stood
erect
the
toll
of
the
plains
my
whole
heart
went
out
to
him
who
in
years
past
had
hunted
the
antelope
deer
elk
and
buffalo
fought
the
cowardly
savages
and
desperadoes
on
the
thirsty
plains
and
amidst
the
ragged
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
penetrated
the
silent
recesses
of
the
dismal
canyons
and
caves
crossed
the
snow
covered
divides
faced
danger
of
every
conceivable
nature
and
at
last
although
maimed
for
life
was
grateful
that
he
had
escaped
death
and
thankful
in
the
thought
that
he
had
done
his
share
in
the
settlement
of
the
then
far
west
as
i
gazed
into
his
once
keen
eyes
and
beheld
that
shriveled
face
my
heart
wrung
with
remorse
for
i
knew
he
had
keenly
suffered
tears
filled
my
eyes
and
trickled
down
my
and
boyish
face
and
i
knew
he
accepted
it
as
an
emblem
of
my
sorrow
for
being
the
innocent
cause
in
a
measure
of
his
cruel
misfortune
thus
by
the
flip
of
a
pebble
was
my
life
spared
but
at
the
expense
of
a
true
friend
chapter
vi
on
to
leavenworth
illustration
t
the
next
summer
i
was
not
very
well
and
so
i
made
a
trip
to
leavenworth
kansas
by
the
southern
or
smoky
hill
route
we
made
the
trip
by
mule
train
of
twenty
wagons
with
six
mules
hitched
to
each
the
driver
rode
the
nigh
mule
and
with
one
line
guided
the
team
if
he
wanted
the
leaders
to
go
to
the
right
he
simply
jerked
fast
or
slow
depending
on
how
quick
he
wanted
to
make
the
turn
if
to
the
left
a
steady
or
quick
pull
the
indians
on
this
trail
were
more
numerous
than
on
the
platte
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
they
were
not
to
be
seen
and
continually
trying
to
drive
off
our
stock
we
did
not
receive
any
great
scare
until
we
reached
the
big
blue
river
where
on
the
fourth
day
of
july
at
ten
in
the
morning
a
large
concord
coach
filled
with
passengers
and
a
small
guard
of
the
united
states
soldiers
which
had
previously
passed
us
were
awaiting
our
arrival
before
daring
to
proceed
on
reaching
the
crest
of
the
bluff
leading
to
the
valley
of
the
river
we
saw
hundreds
of
sioux
indians
in
war
paint
and
feathers
camped
on
the
opposite
side
in
the
underbrush
and
woods
and
in
the
main
trail
directly
in
our
path
we
at
once
went
into
corral
thirty
men
against
a
horde
of
savages
if
they
were
there
to
dispute
our
right
of
progress
was
not
a
pleasant
position
to
be
placed
in
nor
a
fitting
manner
in
which
to
celebrate
the
glorious
fourth
consultations
were
numerous
and
all
took
part
the
redskins
camped
in
plain
sight
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
evidently
in
council
like
ourselves
to
the
right
of
the
trail
was
a
dense
wood
close
to
the
river
bank
on
the
left
was
a
high
perpendicular
bluff
its
sides
unscalable
so
our
route
was
a
genuine
death
trap
should
they
attack
us
after
grub
all
gathered
in
a
circle
and
with
pipes
we
proceeded
with
our
last
council
the
situation
was
talked
over
from
every
point
as
to
what
the
indians
might
do
or
might
not
do
we
finally
arrived
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
the
best
of
us
whatever
move
we
made
a
majority
vote
decided
to
proceed
with
every
man
for
himself
in
case
of
attack
our
wagons
were
empty
which
was
a
little
in
our
favor
as
we
could
go
on
a
mule
trot
or
gallop
the
coach
filled
with
passengers
was
placed
in
the
lead
and
being
the
youngest
of
the
party
they
were
considerate
enough
to
let
me
follow
and
i
did
so
as
closely
as
possible
on
reaching
the
river
bottom
the
driver
of
the
coach
started
his
horses
on
a
run
and
the
lash
was
put
to
every
mule
we
were
all
yelling
like
demons
and
on
our
approach
the
indians
left
the
trail
and
took
to
the
river
thinking
that
we
were
a
hundred
or
more
strong
all
passed
safely
through
that
valley
of
what
might
have
been
a
horrible
massacre
the
unearthly
racket
we
made
was
undoubtedly
our
salvation
but
we
were
not
out
of
danger
by
any
means
and
continued
our
flight
until
eleven
when
we
went
into
corral
for
food
and
rest
at
three
we
again
struck
the
trail
and
it
is
well
that
we
did
for
those
redskins
laid
death
and
destruction
in
their
wake
and
came
very
near
overtaking
us
a
day
later
arriving
at
leavenworth
i
boarded
a
missouri
river
palace
for
louis
thence
to
new
orleans
a
false
friend
on
returning
to
louis
i
met
a
westerner
that
i
knew
only
by
sight
and
by
him
was
induced
to
remain
over
a
few
days
and
take
in
the
city
i
did
and
was
scooped
on
the
third
morning
i
went
through
my
pockets
and
the
bed
piece
by
piece
dumping
its
contents
in
the
center
of
the
room
but
my
roll
was
gone
at
once
i
sought
my
friend
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
plain
case
of
misplaced
confidence
he
had
made
a
touch
in
my
desperation
i
made
a
confident
of
the
caretaker
of
the
hotel
register
being
of
a
sympathetic
nature
he
consoled
me
with
an
invitation
to
stimulate
which
i
did
being
without
a
trunk
i
was
informed
on
my
arrival
it
was
customary
to
pay
as
you
enter
fortunately
i
had
a
meal
to
my
credit
i
was
in
good
condition
having
had
sufficient
victuals
to
last
the
day
after
which
i
proceeded
to
the
river
front
and
here
discovered
a
boat
bound
for
omaha
i
boarded
her
sought
out
the
steward
and
applied
for
a
position
he
replied
that
he
did
not
want
any
help
well
i
suppose
you
will
let
a
fellow
work
his
way
wo
you
his
answer
was
get
off
this
craft
and
without
further
talk
in
not
a
very
gentlemanly
manner
he
assisted
me
on
landing
i
was
mad
clear
through
and
made
up
my
mind
i
was
going
on
that
boat
and
i
did
go
just
before
the
gang
plank
was
pulled
in
i
walked
on
board
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
steward
after
i
had
avoided
him
for
an
hour
and
just
as
i
was
on
the
point
of
congratulating
myself
i
bumped
into
him
you
on
board
it
looks
very
much
as
if
i
were
in
evidence
he
grabbed
me
by
the
coat
collar
and
hustled
me
before
the
captain
i
told
a
straight
story
and
he
being
a
man
told
the
steward
to
take
me
up
to
the
kitchen
and
set
me
to
work
he
did
and
had
his
revenge
in
seeing
that
it
was
nearly
continuous
after
supper
i
worked
the
dish
racket
until
twelve
at
three
the
next
morning
he
awoke
me
out
of
a
sound
sleep
and
set
me
to
cleaning
the
woodwork
of
the
cabin
another
of
my
desirable
duties
was
to
wash
and
polish
the
silver
throwing
the
water
over
the
sides
of
the
boat
an
alert
steward
after
dinner
of
the
second
day
i
proceeded
with
the
tin
bucket
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
overboard
went
its
contents
including
three
silver
spoons
the
spoons
had
no
sooner
left
the
bucket
than
i
felt
something
of
great
force
come
in
contact
with
the
seat
of
my
trousers
for
a
moment
i
thought
surely
perpetual
motion
had
been
discovered
turning
i
was
face
to
face
with
that
infernal
steward
nor
did
that
end
my
troubles
for
during
the
entire
trip
that
particular
locality
of
my
person
was
the
target
for
that
fellow
boot
with
a
terrible
oath
he
informed
me
that
my
landing
would
be
reached
about
midnight
a
day
later
and
was
called
wood
pile
landing
a
short
time
before
reaching
the
place
i
was
hustled
from
my
bunk
by
the
steward
and
in
no
gentle
manner
forced
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
the
night
was
pitch
dark
and
produced
a
decidedly
lonesome
feeling
in
the
one
that
was
to
be
put
off
at
a
wood
pile
on
the
edge
of
an
immense
forest
and
undoubtedly
miles
from
a
dwelling
as
the
boat
reached
the
bank
not
even
waiting
for
the
gang
plank
to
be
shoved
out
the
old
sinner
gave
me
a
push
and
at
the
same
time
applied
the
now
familiar
boot
i
reached
the
earth
on
all
fours
my
first
thought
was
to
present
him
with
a
rock
but
i
curbed
my
temper
for
i
had
no
idea
of
deserting
the
old
ship
in
those
days
the
boilers
of
the
boats
were
fired
with
cord
wood
purchased
of
the
planters
and
delivered
on
the
bank
of
the
river
all
boats
plying
on
the
missouri
river
at
that
time
were
flat
bottom
with
paddle
wheel
at
the
stern
two
long
heavy
poles
were
carried
at
the
bow
and
worked
with
a
windlass
being
used
to
raise
the
bow
of
the
boat
when
becoming
fast
on
a
sand
bar
the
pilot
was
obliged
to
keep
a
continuous
lookout
for
these
bars
as
the
channel
was
treacherous
and
changed
often
on
approaching
the
river
bank
one
of
the
deck
hands
would
jump
off
with
the
bow
line
and
make
fast
to
a
stump
or
tree
then
the
stern
line
was
thrown
to
him
and
similarly
connected
then
the
negro
deck
hands
would
proceed
to
carry
on
the
wood
on
their
bare
shoulders
to
the
tune
of
a
southern
plantation
melody
when
ready
to
start
the
bow
line
was
cast
off
the
paddle
wheel
was
started
by
the
engine
and
by
means
of
the
steering
gear
the
craft
was
swung
out
into
the
stream
then
the
stern
line
was
thrown
aship
and
the
boat
was
off
but
not
without
the
steward
victim
no
sooner
had
the
colored
gentlemen
reached
the
deck
than
i
followed
waiting
until
all
was
quiet
aboard
i
sought
my
berth
the
next
morning
i
proceeded
with
my
work
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
anticipated
the
steward
next
move
would
be
to
throw
me
overboard
and
in
that
belief
told
the
cook
of
what
he
had
done
the
previous
night
at
that
point
he
came
in
and
on
discovering
me
said
you
here
again
his
face
purple
with
rage
his
right
foot
at
once
became
restless
he
made
a
rush
for
me
but
the
cook
with
in
hand
prevented
the
action
of
said
foot
and
my
troubles
with
that
gentleman
were
over
arrival
at
leavenworth
we
soon
reached
leavenworth
and
i
left
the
boat
without
regret
but
a
much
wiser
youth
i
went
to
the
first
national
bank
of
leavenworth
drew
my
money
and
after
a
few
days
rest
i
again
embarked
for
denver
astride
a
mule
we
saw
plenty
of
indians
but
as
the
train
was
a
long
one
they
did
not
molest
us
on
reaching
the
city
of
the
plains
i
at
once
hunted
up
my
old
friend
the
major
who
introduced
me
to
the
head
of
a
firm
of
contractors
who
were
at
that
time
engaged
in
getting
out
ties
in
the
black
hills
for
a
portion
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
then
under
construction
he
told
me
that
he
wanted
a
man
to
go
there
and
straighten
out
a
set
of
books
that
a
former
employee
had
left
badly
mixed
he
also
took
the
trouble
to
inform
me
that
the
country
was
alive
with
indians
and
that
the
man
who
went
there
took
big
chances
and
if
i
were
at
all
timid
i
had
better
not
accept
the
position
my
friend
gave
me
a
strong
recommend
and
i
clinched
the
matter
by
telling
the
gentleman
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
man
ghost
or
indian
he
replied
that
i
was
just
the
man
he
was
in
search
of
and
would
give
me
five
hundred
dollars
in
gold
a
good
horse
and
pay
all
expenses
that
i
should
get
my
traps
and
be
at
the
planter
hotel
for
dinner
he
expected
his
two
partners
from
the
east
to
inspect
the
camp
and
business
and
everything
was
to
be
in
readiness
to
depart
on
their
arrival
our
conveyance
was
a
full
sized
concord
coach
with
six
good
mules
to
draw
it
the
boot
of
the
coach
contained
the
best
of
everything
to
eat
and
drink
the
latter
being
just
as
essential
in
that
country
as
gun
and
ammunition
the
partners
were
detained
en
route
and
did
not
arrive
until
the
second
day
when
they
wished
to
rest
and
see
the
western
sights
so
we
did
not
leave
until
the
fourth
day
two
denverites
accompanied
us
making
six
in
the
party
the
first
afternoon
we
made
miles
and
camped
near
a
stage
station
where
they
keep
for
the
weary
pilgrims
supplies
and
the
rankest
kind
of
corn
juice
known
to
the
professional
drinker
the
following
morning
we
made
an
early
start
and
before
noon
rolled
into
la
port
on
the
cachella
pondre
river
the
only
settlement
on
the
trail
to
the
hills
we
put
up
at
the
stage
station
for
the
night
there
we
met
a
drover
and
a
party
of
cow
boys
with
one
thousand
head
of
california
bronchos
bound
for
the
states
those
cowboys
were
as
wild
as
western
life
could
make
them
yet
a
jolly
good
lot
during
the
evening
at
the
suggestion
of
someone
a
poker
game
was
started
which
lasted
all
night
and
in
the
morning
those
who
had
indulged
in
the
game
were
not
feeling
any
too
good
especially
the
losers
but
nevertheless
they
all
strolled
over
to
the
large
adobe
corral
to
see
our
party
off
a
the
head
of
the
firm
of
contractors
had
his
large
winnings
safely
concealed
in
a
chamois
bag
placed
close
to
his
hide
where
all
wise
men
of
the
west
carried
their
money
in
those
days
the
drover
had
been
a
heavy
but
good
loser
when
about
ready
to
hitch
up
our
mules
he
called
out
to
a
i
go
you
six
of
my
best
bronchos
against
five
hundred
dollars
that
you
have
a
man
in
your
outfit
that
can
drive
the
d
d
brutes
a
mile
and
return
the
contractor
approached
me
and
asked
if
i
thought
i
could
do
it
i
told
him
that
i
was
willing
to
take
the
chance
without
another
word
he
walked
over
to
where
the
drover
was
standing
and
informed
him
that
he
would
take
the
bet
provided
he
would
have
his
cowpunchers
hitch
the
little
devils
to
the
coach
agreed
shouted
the
old
fellow
in
no
uncertain
language
the
boys
turned
to
the
work
with
a
will
for
the
fun
expected
even
if
i
received
a
broken
neck
for
my
daredevil
recklessness
excited
them
to
the
highest
pitch
the
reader
has
undoubtedly
seen
in
the
wild
west
circuses
the
overland
coach
hung
by
heavy
springs
from
front
to
rear
axle
one
of
the
most
uncomfortable
conveyances
to
ride
in
ever
invented
especially
for
the
driver
for
if
the
coach
was
not
heavily
loaded
when
the
front
wheels
dropped
into
a
hole
the
old
ramshackle
thing
was
liable
to
topple
over
on
the
animals
and
if
the
driver
was
not
securely
strapped
to
the
seat
when
the
rear
wheels
reached
the
hole
he
would
land
some
distance
in
the
rear
the
contractor
had
the
old
ark
properly
balanced
before
starting
so
i
had
no
excuse
to
worry
from
that
source
the
cowpunchers
selected
one
broncho
each
and
after
a
half
hawling
pulling
and
coaxing
succeeded
in
hitching
them
to
the
coach
i
climbed
to
the
seat
and
was
securely
strapped
with
a
large
leather
apron
then
i
gathered
up
the
lines
and
placed
myself
solidly
for
the
start
the
whip
socket
contained
a
hickory
stick
five
feet
long
with
a
lash
twelve
feet
in
length
attached
to
one
end
i
gave
the
word
to
let
them
go
but
the
little
bronchos
thought
different
and
balked
the
number
of
times
they
bucked
and
threw
themselves
started
and
bucked
again
would
be
impossible
to
say
finally
the
contractor
accused
the
drover
of
being
in
collusion
with
his
cowpuncher
in
order
to
win
the
wager
by
holding
the
bronchos
back
and
a
volley
of
words
of
not
very
mild
character
ensued
after
which
the
six
cowboys
three
on
either
side
of
the
team
stood
off
six
feet
the
noise
made
by
the
cracking
of
their
whips
their
everlasting
yelping
made
the
excitement
stronger
than
before
and
i
was
off
on
the
wildest
ride
i
ever
took
a
hurdle
jumper
would
not
stand
much
of
a
chance
with
one
of
those
wild
bronchos
a
dangerous
ride
it
was
a
lovely
june
morning
and
the
bracing
air
of
colorado
made
me
feel
as
wild
as
the
young
animals
that
were
fast
wheeling
me
over
the
dangerous
trail
and
possibly
into
a
camp
of
hostile
indians
i
gave
no
thought
to
danger
for
i
was
too
busy
keeping
the
fiery
little
beasts
to
the
trail
they
were
going
at
breakneck
speed
with
no
sign
of
tiring
so
i
let
them
go
enjoying
the
sport
even
more
than
they
my
hat
went
flying
with
the
wind
i
looked
back
but
could
not
see
the
ranch
how
far
i
had
left
it
behind
or
what
distance
i
had
covered
i
knew
not
at
last
i
came
to
myself
and
realized
for
the
first
time
what
terrible
danger
i
was
in
slowly
turning
the
team
to
the
right
i
began
a
circle
hardly
perceptible
at
first
but
finally
again
reaching
the
trail
on
the
return
trip
i
plied
the
long
lash
to
the
leading
pair
they
shot
forward
faster
than
ever
all
steaming
with
foam
and
covered
with
lather
at
a
great
distance
to
the
south
i
could
see
a
party
of
indians
riding
in
the
same
direction
this
additional
danger
seemed
fairly
to
intoxicate
me
and
i
plied
the
whip
with
all
my
strength
the
corral
loomed
up
and
then
the
stage
station
the
others
with
hands
in
their
pockets
and
mouth
agap
were
holding
their
breath
and
as
we
wheeled
past
them
the
cowboys
lashing
the
bronchos
a
mighty
shout
went
up
i
had
won
the
wager
and
was
the
lion
of
the
day
we
did
not
make
a
start
until
the
following
morning
we
fastened
the
bronchos
together
and
tied
the
leader
to
the
rear
of
the
coach
and
thus
resumed
our
journey
to
the
hills
where
we
safely
arrived
two
days
later
but
minus
four
of
the
treacherous
brutes
at
night
we
always
picketed
them
with
the
mules
and
the
four
that
were
lost
had
pulled
their
picket
irons
and
undoubtedly
gone
to
join
the
much
read
of
wild
horses
of
the
plains
the
camp
in
the
hills
consisted
of
shanties
for
fifteen
hundred
men
saw
mill
and
outfit
store
the
latter
included
in
its
stock
plenty
of
the
best
kind
of
liquor
each
man
was
allowed
three
drinks
a
day
and
no
more
i
had
the
books
straightened
out
in
due
time
and
one
day
the
contractor
discovered
he
would
soon
be
out
of
flour
and
the
nearest
point
at
which
it
could
be
purchased
was
la
port
miles
distant
the
indians
were
troublesome
and
each
man
who
was
asked
refused
to
go
with
one
exception
the
contractor
finally
made
me
a
tempting
offer
to
accompany
a
driver
of
a
six
mule
team
i
accepted
and
at
break
of
day
the
next
morning
we
started
my
companion
on
that
dangerous
trip
was
a
plucky
son
of
the
emerald
isle
we
camped
that
night
on
lodge
pole
creek
on
the
opposite
side
was
an
adobe
ranch
and
an
immense
stockade
owned
by
a
frenchman
with
a
sioux
squaw
for
a
wife
in
our
hurried
start
we
had
forgotten
our
tobacco
and
without
it
my
companion
seemed
lost
after
grub
i
mounted
my
horse
and
crossed
over
the
creek
to
procure
some
on
making
my
wants
known
i
was
freely
supplied
with
tobacco
and
was
also
informed
that
before
we
arrived
they
had
been
fighting
the
indians
for
some
time
that
one
of
the
cowboys
had
an
arm
badly
shattered
and
that
they
feared
another
attack
the
next
morning
i
returned
to
camp
and
told
my
companion
of
our
danger
a
welcome
haven
after
giving
the
animals
plenty
of
feed
and
rest
we
again
took
the
trail
at
as
the
day
dawned
with
the
aid
of
a
field
glass
i
discovered
indians
swooping
down
on
the
ranch
with
the
stockade
at
breakneck
speed
and
others
coming
in
our
direction
i
told
patrick
to
urge
the
mules
to
a
gallop
he
suspected
the
cause
and
did
so
at
once
over
the
rolling
ground
we
flew
until
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
heavens
and
as
each
hour
passed
the
redskins
gained
on
us
until
at
last
they
could
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
the
harsh
and
cruel
of
those
savages
echoed
and
back
from
the
distant
hills
and
over
the
desolate
plains
until
men
and
beasts
were
crazed
to
desperation
the
lash
was
put
to
the
already
tired
mules
and
we
strained
every
nerve
to
reach
the
crest
of
the
next
knoll
hoping
against
hope
for
succor
on
they
came
their
warwhoops
for
scalps
and
the
white
man
blood
was
now
continuous
the
long
feared
report
of
their
rifles
was
at
last
heard
bullets
pierced
our
canvas
covered
wagon
we
made
a
last
desperate
effort
and
reached
the
summit
of
the
bluff
not
a
half
a
mile
from
its
base
was
a
large
corral
of
white
covered
wagons
down
the
incline
we
flew
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
and
on
reaching
the
corral
both
men
and
beasts
fell
into
a
heap
exhausted
the
red
devils
rode
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
warwhoop
of
anger
they
sent
up
rings
in
my
ears
at
times
to
this
very
day
that
evening
we
again
took
the
trail
and
made
the
remainder
of
the
trip
by
night
drives
reaching
la
port
the
third
morning
we
secured
our
load
and
after
giving
the
animals
a
much
needed
rest
we
started
on
the
return
trip
the
fourth
morning
we
arrived
at
the
ranch
with
the
stockade
three
mornings
after
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
hills
where
the
company
had
a
log
cabin
for
their
hunters
and
trappers
who
with
their
trusty
rifles
furnished
antelope
deer
and
buffalo
meat
for
their
small
army
of
employees
on
entering
a
sight
met
our
gaze
too
revolting
to
pass
from
memory
upon
the
earthy
floor
lay
two
of
those
sturdy
and
dwellers
of
the
plains
and
rockies
cold
in
death
scalped
and
mutilated
almost
beyond
recognition
a
deed
committed
by
those
dastardly
red
fiends
of
the
far
west
both
were
friends
of
mine
and
with
uncovered
head
in
the
presence
of
that
gritty
son
of
old
ireland
i
vowed
vengeance
at
least
charlie
said
patrick
let
give
them
a
decent
burial
and
move
on
we
did
so
reaching
camp
that
evening
just
as
the
sun
with
its
beautiful
tints
of
carmine
was
bidding
plains
and
hills
goodnight
as
if
in
memory
of
those
stalwart
and
brave
men
who
made
the
settlement
and
civilization
of
the
west
possible
chapter
vii
a
plucky
german
illustration
t
two
weeks
later
a
strapping
german
who
was
in
charge
of
another
camp
further
down
the
line
came
for
a
visit
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
proposed
that
we
should
go
hunting
to
which
i
agreed
that
morning
as
usual
the
men
called
for
their
liquor
and
among
them
was
a
long
lanky
fellow
with
red
hair
and
bushy
beard
he
certainly
had
the
appearance
of
an
outlaw
he
had
received
one
glass
of
grog
and
came
for
the
second
which
i
refused
him
without
a
word
i
was
on
my
back
at
that
point
the
german
came
in
and
caught
him
with
the
left
hand
in
the
same
locality
suffering
with
pain
and
crazed
with
liquor
he
left
the
store
secured
his
revolvers
and
returned
i
was
behind
the
counter
at
the
time
with
my
back
to
the
door
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
heard
the
report
of
a
revolver
and
a
bullet
whizzed
past
my
ear
and
buried
itself
in
a
can
of
tomatoes
not
six
inches
from
my
head
as
i
turned
around
i
saw
the
fellow
being
propelled
through
the
door
by
the
german
right
at
that
point
the
contractor
came
in
and
after
being
told
of
what
had
happened
he
discharged
the
fellow
he
wished
to
retain
his
revolvers
but
his
request
was
not
granted
he
had
an
army
musket
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
keep
that
i
told
a
not
to
let
him
have
it
for
i
was
satisfied
from
the
blow
he
gave
me
that
he
was
a
bad
actor
but
a
being
good
natured
and
kind
hearted
consented
he
ordered
four
days
rations
put
up
for
him
and
he
left
camp
in
an
ugly
mood
and
was
given
no
further
thought
after
grub
the
german
proposed
that
we
flip
a
coin
to
see
who
should
go
for
the
horses
the
visitor
losing
he
at
once
started
for
the
canyon
below
where
the
horses
were
grazing
shortly
after
i
heard
a
shot
and
then
many
more
but
gave
it
no
heed
as
it
was
a
common
occurrence
there
half
an
hour
later
one
of
the
men
came
in
and
told
me
that
the
german
lay
dead
in
the
canyon
below
i
with
the
others
in
camp
proceeded
to
the
point
indicated
where
we
found
the
poor
fellow
lying
on
his
back
a
bullet
from
that
villian
musket
had
pierced
his
heart
his
watch
belt
of
cartridges
revolvers
and
repeating
carbine
were
gone
after
we
returned
with
the
body
a
had
the
mill
whistle
blown
calling
all
hands
to
quarters
and
for
three
days
and
nights
with
little
sleep
or
rest
we
searched
those
hills
and
trails
leading
to
salt
lake
and
denver
we
picketed
men
on
each
trail
to
search
all
passing
trains
but
the
demon
gave
us
the
slip
and
cheated
that
maddened
crowd
of
a
lynching
or
something
worse
perhaps
a
tug
of
war
between
two
wild
bronchos
which
we
had
in
camp
with
that
man
body
as
the
connecting
link
i
can
to
this
day
remember
just
how
that
poor
fellow
looked
cold
in
death
far
from
home
and
loved
ones
with
no
mother
to
weep
at
his
bier
with
uncovered
heads
we
lowered
him
in
earth
in
a
rough
box
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
tall
sentinels
of
the
hills
and
placed
a
slab
to
mark
the
spot
that
his
friends
might
some
day
claim
all
that
remained
of
as
brave
and
honest
a
german
as
ever
lived
a
watchful
providence
thus
by
the
toss
of
a
coin
was
my
life
again
spared
this
last
narrow
escape
from
death
was
the
fourteenth
of
which
i
positively
knew
and
how
many
more
that
i
did
not
know
of
it
is
impossible
to
tell
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
out
of
the
country
alive
if
possible
i
informed
a
of
my
intentions
and
the
following
day
closed
my
business
and
at
dusk
that
evening
i
started
unaccompanied
on
a
two
hundred
mile
ride
over
a
trail
watched
by
hundreds
of
indians
i
knew
that
no
indian
pony
could
overtake
my
fleet
runner
and
all
that
was
to
be
feared
was
a
surprise
or
have
my
horse
shot
from
under
me
i
camped
far
from
the
trail
with
lariat
fastened
to
my
wrist
never
closing
my
eyes
until
my
faithful
animal
had
laid
down
for
the
day
his
first
move
at
dusk
awoke
me
and
after
feed
we
were
off
with
the
wind
at
breakneck
speed
at
the
close
of
the
second
day
while
i
lay
sleeping
on
the
desert
sands
with
the
saddle
blanket
for
a
pillow
and
dreaming
of
my
far
away
home
it
seemed
as
if
something
of
a
slimy
nature
was
slowly
crawling
over
the
calf
of
my
bare
leg
on
gaining
partial
consciousness
too
quickly
did
i
realize
that
it
was
a
reality
and
not
a
dream
a
rattlesnake
long
slimy
body
was
crossing
that
bridge
of
flesh
squirming
along
for
a
couple
of
inches
then
raising
its
repulsive
body
a
foot
or
more
and
turning
its
insignificant
head
would
look
straight
towards
my
partly
closed
eyes
and
with
its
hideous
mouth
agap
would
dart
its
poisonous
tongue
in
and
out
like
lightning
then
lowering
itself
it
would
resume
the
same
tactics
as
before
how
many
times
it
repeated
this
i
shall
never
know
no
words
have
ever
been
formed
that
can
adequately
express
the
feeling
that
took
possession
of
me
i
seemed
powerless
to
move
a
muscle
or
twitch
an
the
suspense
was
terrible
expecting
each
time
that
the
slimy
body
descended
the
viper
would
thrust
his
poisonous
lance
into
my
leg
and
all
would
be
over
the
horror
of
it
all
can
not
be
imagined
and
to
this
day
when
i
recall
the
incident
it
sends
a
shiver
through
my
entire
body
as
the
coarse
rattles
of
his
tail
left
the
bare
flesh
of
my
leg
my
senses
seemed
to
return
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
through
the
pant
of
my
right
leg
i
felt
that
same
crawling
sensation
and
i
knew
in
an
instant
that
it
was
a
mate
following
the
one
that
had
just
passed
over
the
bridge
of
flesh
as
soon
as
it
reached
the
bare
leg
the
dirty
reptile
went
through
the
same
horrible
stunts
as
the
first
one
the
agony
seemed
impossible
to
bear
and
when
at
last
the
thing
had
completed
its
journey
and
was
at
a
safe
distance
away
i
leaped
into
the
air
how
far
i
shall
leave
the
reader
to
surmise
crazed
with
anger
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
rushed
for
my
revolvers
and
fired
at
random
i
was
considered
a
good
shot
in
those
days
but
in
this
excited
condition
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
hit
a
barn
i
ran
for
my
henry
carbine
and
grasping
it
by
the
barrel
made
short
work
of
ridding
the
earth
of
the
cause
that
had
produced
the
most
terrifying
scare
experience
during
my
western
life
illustration
billie
billie
the
faithful
horse
for
the
first
time
during
the
excitement
my
thoughts
turned
to
my
faithful
horse
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
horror
of
the
situation
began
to
dawn
upon
me
and
i
realized
at
once
that
i
was
lost
on
that
desolate
plain
one
hundred
miles
from
any
camp
that
i
knew
of
and
apparently
alone
i
cried
out
my

was

or
talk
to
an
indian
would
have
been
a
comfort
driven
to
agonizing
despair
i
ran
for
my
field
glass
and
scanned
the
rolling
ground
in
every
direction
buffalo
deer
antelope
coyote
and
a
small
party
of
horsemen
were
visible
but
the
latter
too
far
away
to
make
out
if
they
were
united
states
cavalrymen
or
indians
looking
again
without
my
glass
i
discovered
my
horse
standing
on
a
high
knoll
not
more
than
a
half
mile
away
with
head
and
tail
erect
the
breath
from
his
dilated
nostrils
ascending
heavenward
in
the
cold
october
air
and
presenting
a
picture
for
an
artist
i
called
loudly
billie
billie
and
with
outstretched
hand
walked
slowly
toward
him
but
he
looked
not
in
my
direction
all
of
a
sudden
he
made
a
quick
bound
and
was
off
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
a
minute
seemed
an
hour
but
i
kept
walking
after
him
and
he
finally
stopped
turned
around
and
faced
me
that
look
can
never
be
forgotten
with
ears
thrown
back
he
came
slowly
toward
me
again
i
called
billie
billie
and
held
out
both
hands
and
with
a
whinner
he
came
on
a
gallop
trembling
in
every
muscle
seemingly
as
frightened
as
myself
i
patted
his
neck
straightened
out
his
rich
heavy
mane
rubbed
his
face
and
nose
and
kissed
him
he
licked
my
cheek
and
hand
in
appreciation
of
my
welcome
moisture
gathered
in
his
large
eyes
and
i
cried
with
joy
like
a
child
that
i
was
and
then
we
both
felt
better
i
coiled
up
the
lariat
and
placed
my
right
arm
over
his
perfectly
formed
neck
and
slowly
walked
to
our
little
camp
i
rubbed
him
down
until
he
was
perfectly
dry
then
curried
brushed
and
rubbed
until
i
could
almost
see
myself
in
his
coat
of
silky
hair
then
i
made
him
lay
down
and
did
the
same
thing
myself
using
his
withers
and
mane
for
a
pillow
when
i
awoke
the
moon
shown
full
in
our
faces
i
patted
his
neck
and
soon
those
large
eyes
were
looking
affectionately
into
mine
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
he
did
the
same
after
brushing
off
the
side
on
which
he
had
laid
i
placed
the
saddle
blanket
buckled
taut
the
saddle
gathered
up
my
small
camp
kit
and
fastened
it
to
the
rear
of
the
saddle
coiled
the
lariat
and
hung
it
on
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
fastened
on
my
spurs
from
which
he
had
never
felt
even
the
slightest
touch
threw
my
field
glass
over
my
left
shoulder
buckled
on
my
cartridge
belt
and
revolvers
swung
my
canteen
and
henry
carbine
over
my
right
shoulder
and
with
a
leap
landed
astride
the
saddle
and
was
off
with
the
wind
in
search
of
the
trail
two
full
miles
away
the
indians
capture
a
friend
early
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
i
stopped
at
a
stage
station
where
i
met
the
assistant
wagon
boss
who
was
with
the
bull
train
during
my
first
trip
across
the
plains
he
was
a
genuine
missouri
bushwacker
and
a
desperate
fellow
like
all
others
of
his
class
he
wore
his
hair
long
making
it
a
much
coveted
prize
for
the
indians
after
the
days
visit
and
relating
our
experience
of
western
life
he
told
me
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
black
hills
i
reluctantly
volunteered
the
information
to
him
that
i
did
not
think
he
would
ever
reach
there
on
the
old
skate
he
was
riding
and
that
he
should
not
venture
on
the
trail
until
after
dark
but
he
knew
it
all
and
started
at
sundown
i
was
sure
the
fellow
would
never
reach
the
hills
nor
was
i
mistaken
for
in
less
than
an
hour
the
salt
lake
coach
rolled
up
to
the
door
of
the
station
and
the
driver
asked
if
a
horseman
had
put
up
at
the
place
and
being
informed
that
there
had
told
us
the
indians
had
captured
him
and
tied
him
to
one
of
their
own
ponies
and
was
rapidly
going
north
leaving
his
old
nag
to
be
picked
up
by
any
one
who
would
care
for
it
not
a
day
passed
that
the
unwelcome
savages
were
not
to
be
seen
and
we
were
chased
many
times
but
the
faithful
animal
reached
denver
in
safety
the
union
pacific
railroad
had
then
reached
julesburg
and
i
conceived
the
hazardous
idea
of
reaching
that
point
by
navigating
the
platte
river
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
so
i
at
once
ordered
a
flat
bottomed
boat
built
of
material
in
the
rough
a
cunning
schemer
i
next
went
in
quest
of
my
aged
chum
the
dealer
who
when
found
revealed
by
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
another
scheme
which
he
was
quite
capable
of
concocting
when
alone
in
his
warehouse
den
he
exclaimed
with
much
feeling
and
a
forced
tear
that
he
was
right
down
glad
to
see
me
safely
back
and
gave
me
little
rest
until
i
had
related
my
experiences
in
the
hills
he
then
unfolded
his
diabolical
scheme
whereby
both
of
us
could
lay
a
foundation
for
a
fortune
i
was
in
need
of
the
latter
without
any
question
but
not
by
this
method
cheyenne
had
just
been
surveyed
mapped
and
laid
out
and
the
proposition
was
for
him
to
furnish
a
man
two
mule
teams
wagons
tents
provisions
and
all
other
necessities
and
this
man
and
myself
were
to
go
there
and
squat
or
take
possession
of
two
sections
of
government
land
consisting
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
acres
each
located
just
outside
the
city
limits
the
offer
was
promptly
rejected
and
it
destroyed
the
last
particle
of
friendship
that
had
existed
between
us
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
had
just
been
through
that
part
of
the
country
and
had
narrowly
escaped
death
many
times
and
for
us
to
carry
out
this
scheme
i
knew
would
be
impossible
for
the
tricky
redskins
would
be
certain
to
capture
us
i
can
not
recollect
the
exact
reply
that
i
made
him
but
am
positive
i
requested
him
to
go
to
hades
by
the
shortest
possible
route
we
parted
in
anger
after
three
long
years
of
friendship
the
old
major
love
for
the
almighty
dollar
was
the
cause
i
never
did
have
a
very
strong
desire
to
furnish
material
to
the
cruel
savages
for
one
of
their
home
scalp
dances
and
besides
my
mind
was
made
up
to
leave
colorado
which
i
did
i
afterwards
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
fellow
a
college
graduate
who
had
been
unable
to
secure
a
position
to
his
liking
and
was
anxious
to
return
to
the
states
after
a
few
days
of
good
fellowship
and
finding
him
of
the
right
material
i
made
my
plans
known
to
him
he
at
once
fell
in
with
them
and
a
week
later
we
embarked
on
our
perilous
journey
we
started
at
full
moon
drifting
with
a
comparatively
strong
current
using
paddles
to
guide
our
roughly
constructed
craft
we
made
nightly
rides
of
about
fifty
miles
and
at
dawn
would
land
on
one
of
the
small
islands
of
the
river
conceal
ourselves
and
the
boat
in
the
tall
grass
from
which
we
were
able
to
see
all
that
passed
by
trail
and
bluffs
and
not
be
seen
ourselves
our
greatest
danger
was
in
being
discovered
by
the
indians
on
the
high
bluffs
or
a
visit
from
them
to
the
island
we
occupied
the
first
scare
we
had
was
when
a
party
of
a
dozen
or
more
rode
to
the
bank
of
the
river
for
the
purpose
as
we
supposed
of
crossing
they
seemed
however
undecided
as
to
their
course
but
finally
urged
their
ponies
down
the
bank
and
into
the
river
to
describe
our
feelings
would
be
impossible
just
then
to
us
a
minute
seemed
an
hour
cold
beads
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
both
not
exactly
from
fear
but
a
sort
of
yearning
to
be
elsewhere
and
i
wondered
after
all
that
i
had
passed
through
if
i
was
to
be
cut
down
on
my
homeward
journey
by
those
fiendish
red
devils
saved
whispered
my
friend
they
are
leaving
the
river
and
sure
enough
those
little
prairie
ponies
were
climbing
the
bank
on
a
dead
run
for
the
bluffs
illustration
home
ride
down
the
platte
river
the
last
night
of
that
eventful
ride
lasted
long
until
after
the
sun
was
up
the
large
concord
coach
filled
with
passengers
passed
close
to
the
river
bank
a
short
time
before
and
from
the
driver
we
learned
we
were
ten
miles
from
julesburg
we
proceeded
keeping
close
to
the
bank
and
with
field
glass
continually
swept
the
valley
and
bluffs
in
every
direction
we
were
facing
a
mild
and
depressing
wind
all
of
a
sudden
dismal
sounds
reached
our
ears
and
as
the
noiseless
current
of
the
river
rounded
the
projecting
points
in
its
banks
it
bore
our
staunch
old
craft
to
a
place
of
safety
or
ourselves
to
a
cruel
death
we
knew
not
which
the
sounds
became
more
distinct
until
both
of
us
were
satisfied
that
the
indians
had
captured
the
overland
coach
with
its
load
of
human
freight
as
we
rounded
the
next
bend
the
river
took
a
straight
course
but
there
was
no
island
in
sight
no
island
in
sight
said
my
friend
where
can
we
go
and
turning
around
i
discovered
he
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
as
for
myself
i
was
hanging
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
trying
hard
to
collect
my
wits
and
recover
from
a
fainting
spell
we
finally
managed
to
get
the
boat
back
and
around
the
bend
where
we
lay
concealed
for
some
time
suffering
the
torture
of
hades
i
finally
crawled
to
the
top
of
the
bank
and
with
field
glass
surveyed
the
locality
in
every
direction
no
life
was
visible
still
the
unearthly
noise
kept
up
and
the
feeling
of
those
two
lone
travelers
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
thought
at
last
came
to
me
that
we
must
be
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
old
california
crossing
i
crawled
back
to
the
boat
and
told
my
companion
to
go
ahead
while
i
continually
used
the
field
glass
after
fifteen
minutes
i
discovered
a
white
speck
in
the
eastern
horizon
we
were
soon
over
our
fright
and
with
light
hearts
were
sailing
over
the
rippling
waters
of
the
old
platte
feeling
assured
that
we
would
soon
reach
a
place
of
safety
as
far
as
the
indians
were
concerned
on
arriving
at
the
crossing
which
it
proved
to
be
we
found
one
of
those
large
white
covered
prairie
schooners
stalled
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
fifty
greasers
as
the
mexican
drivers
were
called
and
as
many
yoke
of
oxen
trying
to
haul
it
out
farewell
to
the
plains
we
sailed
merrily
along
and
at
two
reached
julesburg
the
then
terminus
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
overland
shipping
point
for
all
territory
west
north
and
south
the
union
pacific
railroad
when
under
construction
made
a
terminus
every
two
or
three
hundred
miles
the
houses
were
built
in
sections
so
they
were
easily
taken
apart
loaded
on
flat
freight
cars
and
taken
to
the
next
terminus
completely
deserting
the
former
town
julesburg
was
rightfully
named
the
portable
hell
of
the
plains
my
finer
feelings
can
not
if
words
could
attempt
a
description
suffice
to
say
that
during
the
three
days
we
were
there
four
men
and
women
were
buried
in
their
street
costumes
the
fourth
day
we
boarded
a
union
pacific
train
and
were
whirled
to
its
eastern
terminus
omaha
thence
home
arriving
safely
after
an
absence
of
four
years
the
habits
formed
during
those
western
years
were
hard
to
change
and
the
fight
of
my
life
to
live
a
semblance
of
the
proper
life
required
a
will
power
as
irresistible
as
the
crystal
quartz
taken
from
the
lofty
snow
capped
mountain
sides
taking
tons
of
weight
to
crush
it
that
the
good
might
be
separated
