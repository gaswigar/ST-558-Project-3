conclusion
of
this
book
appendix
to
the
treatise
of
human
nature
vol
i
of
the
understanding
advertisement
my
design
in
the
present
work
is
sufficiently
explained
in
the
introduction
the
reader
must
only
observe
that
all
the
subjects
i
have
there
planned
out
to
myself
are
not
treated
of
in
these
two
volumes
the
subjects
of
the
understanding
and
passions
make
a
compleat
chain
of
reasoning
by
themselves
and
i
was
willing
to
take
advantage
of
this
natural
division
in
order
to
try
the
taste
of
the
public
if
i
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
success
i
shall
proceed
to
the
examination
of
morals
politics
and
criticism
which
will
compleat
this
treatise
of
human
nature
the
approbation
of
the
public
i
consider
as
the
greatest
reward
of
my
labours
but
am
determined
to
regard
its
judgment
whatever
it
be
as
my
best
instruction
introduction
nothing
is
more
usual
and
more
natural
for
those
who
pretend
to
discover
anything
new
to
the
world
in
philosophy
and
the
sciences
than
to
insinuate
the
praises
of
their
own
systems
by
decrying
all
those
which
have
been
advanced
before
them
and
indeed
were
they
content
with
lamenting
that
ignorance
which
we
still
lie
under
in
the
most
important
questions
that
can
come
before
the
tribunal
of
human
reason
there
are
few
who
have
an
acquaintance
with
the
sciences
that
would
not
readily
agree
with
them
it
is
easy
for
one
of
judgment
and
learning
to
perceive
the
weak
foundation
even
of
those
systems
which
have
obtained
the
greatest
credit
and
have
carried
their
pretensions
highest
to
accurate
and
profound
reasoning
principles
taken
upon
trust
consequences
lamely
deduced
from
them
want
of
coherence
in
the
parts
and
of
evidence
in
the
whole
these
are
every
where
to
be
met
with
in
the
systems
of
the
most
eminent
philosophers
and
seem
to
have
drawn
disgrace
upon
philosophy
itself
nor
is
there
required
such
profound
knowledge
to
discover
the
present
imperfect
condition
of
the
sciences
but
even
the
rabble
without
doors
may
judge
from
the
noise
and
clamour
which
they
hear
that
all
goes
not
well
within
there
is
nothing
which
is
not
the
subject
of
debate
and
in
which
men
of
learning
are
not
of
contrary
opinions
the
most
trivial
question
escapes
not
our
controversy
and
in
the
most
momentous
we
are
not
able
to
give
any
certain
decision
disputes
are
multiplied
as
if
every
thing
was
uncertain
and
these
disputes
are
managed
with
the
greatest
warmth
as
if
every
thing
was
certain
amidst
all
this
bustle
it
is
not
reason
which
carries
the
prize
but
eloquence
and
no
man
needs
ever
despair
of
gaining
proselytes
to
the
most
extravagant
hypothesis
who
has
art
enough
to
represent
it
in
any
favourable
colours
the
victory
is
not
gained
by
the
men
at
arms
who
manage
the
pike
and
the
sword
but
by
the
trumpeters
drummers
and
musicians
of
the
army
from
hence
in
my
opinion
arises
that
common
prejudice
against
metaphysical
reasonings
of
all
kinds
even
amongst
those
who
profess
themselves
scholars
and
have
a
just
value
for
every
other
part
of
literature
by
metaphysical
reasonings
they
do
not
understand
those
on
any
particular
branch
of
science
but
every
kind
of
argument
which
is
any
way
abstruse
and
requires
some
attention
to
be
comprehended
we
have
so
often
lost
our
labour
in
such
researches
that
we
commonly
reject
them
without
hesitation
and
resolve
if
we
must
for
ever
be
a
prey
to
errors
and
delusions
that
they
shall
at
least
be
natural
and
entertaining
and
indeed
nothing
but
the
most
determined
scepticism
along
with
a
great
degree
of
indolence
can
justify
this
aversion
to
metaphysics
for
if
truth
be
at
all
within
the
reach
of
human
capacity
it
is
certain
it
must
lie
very
deep
and
abstruse
and
to
hope
we
shall
arrive
at
it
without
pains
while
the
greatest
geniuses
have
failed
with
the
utmost
pains
must
certainly
be
esteemed
sufficiently
vain
and
presumptuous
i
pretend
to
no
such
advantage
in
the
philosophy
i
am
going
to
unfold
and
would
esteem
it
a
strong
presumption
against
it
were
it
so
very
easy
and
obvious
it
is
evident
that
all
the
sciences
have
a
relation
greater
or
less
to
human
nature
and
that
however
wide
any
of
them
may
seem
to
run
from
it
they
still
return
back
by
one
passage
or
another
even
mathematics
natural
philosophy
and
natural
religion
are
in
some
measure
dependent
on
the
science
of
man
since
the
lie
under
the
cognizance
of
men
and
are
judged
of
by
their
powers
and
faculties
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
changes
and
improvements
we
might
make
in
these
sciences
were
we
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
extent
and
force
of
human
understanding
and
could
explain
the
nature
of
the
ideas
we
employ
and
of
the
operations
we
perform
in
our
reasonings
and
these
improvements
are
the
more
to
be
hoped
for
in
natural
religion
as
it
is
not
content
with
instructing
us
in
the
nature
of
superior
powers
but
carries
its
views
farther
to
their
disposition
towards
us
and
our
duties
towards
them
and
consequently
we
ourselves
are
not
only
the
beings
that
reason
but
also
one
of
the
objects
concerning
which
we
reason
if
therefore
the
sciences
of
mathematics
natural
philosophy
and
natural
religion
have
such
a
dependence
on
the
knowledge
of
man
what
may
be
expected
in
the
other
sciences
whose
connexion
with
human
nature
is
more
close
and
intimate
the
sole
end
of
logic
is
to
explain
the
principles
and
operations
of
our
reasoning
faculty
and
the
nature
of
our
ideas
morals
and
criticism
regard
our
tastes
and
sentiments
and
politics
consider
men
as
united
in
society
and
dependent
on
each
other
in
these
four
sciences
of
logic
morals
criticism
and
politics
is
comprehended
almost
everything
which
it
can
any
way
import
us
to
be
acquainted
with
or
which
can
tend
either
to
the
improvement
or
ornament
of
the
human
mind
here
then
is
the
only
expedient
from
which
we
can
hope
for
success
in
our
philosophical
researches
to
leave
the
tedious
lingering
method
which
we
have
hitherto
followed
and
instead
of
taking
now
and
then
a
castle
or
village
on
the
frontier
to
march
up
directly
to
the
capital
or
center
of
these
sciences
to
human
nature
itself
which
being
once
masters
of
we
may
every
where
else
hope
for
an
easy
victory
from
this
station
we
may
extend
our
conquests
over
all
those
sciences
which
more
intimately
concern
human
life
and
may
afterwards
proceed
at
leisure
to
discover
more
fully
those
which
are
the
objects
of
pore
curiosity
there
is
no
question
of
importance
whose
decision
is
not
comprised
in
the
science
of
man
and
there
is
none
which
can
be
decided
with
any
certainty
before
we
become
acquainted
with
that
science
in
pretending
therefore
to
explain
the
principles
of
human
nature
we
in
effect
propose
a
compleat
system
of
the
sciences
built
on
a
foundation
almost
entirely
new
and
the
only
one
upon
which
they
can
stand
with
any
security
and
as
the
science
of
man
is
solid
foundation
for
the
other
sciences
so
the
only
solid
foundation
we
can
give
to
this
science
itself
must
be
laid
on
experience
and
observation
it
is
no
astonishing
reflection
to
consider
that
the
application
of
experimental
philosophy
to
moral
subjects
should
come
after
that
to
natural
at
the
distance
of
above
a
whole
century
since
we
find
in
fact
that
there
was
about
the
same
interval
betwixt
the
origins
of
these
sciences
and
that
reckoning
from
thales
to
socrates
the
space
of
time
is
nearly
equal
to
that
betwixt
my
lord
bacon
and
some
late
philosophers
locke
my
lord
shaftesbury
mandeville
hutchinson
butler
etc
in
england
who
have
begun
to
put
the
science
of
man
on
a
new
footing
and
have
engaged
the
attention
and
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
public
so
true
it
is
that
however
other
nations
may
rival
us
in
poetry
and
excel
us
in
some
other
agreeable
arts
the
improvements
in
reason
and
philosophy
can
only
be
owing
to
a
land
of
toleration
and
of
liberty
nor
ought
we
to
think
that
this
latter
improvement
in
the
science
of
man
will
do
less
honour
to
our
native
country
than
the
former
in
natural
philosophy
but
ought
rather
to
esteem
it
a
greater
glory
upon
account
of
the
greater
importance
of
that
science
as
well
as
the
necessity
it
lay
under
of
such
a
reformation
for
to
me
it
seems
evident
that
the
essence
of
the
mind
being
equally
unknown
to
us
with
that
of
external
bodies
it
must
be
equally
impossible
to
form
any
notion
of
its
powers
and
qualities
otherwise
than
from
careful
and
exact
experiments
and
the
observation
of
those
particular
effects
which
result
from
its
different
circumstances
and
situations
and
though
we
must
endeavour
to
render
all
our
principles
as
universal
as
possible
by
tracing
up
our
experiments
to
the
utmost
and
explaining
all
effects
from
the
simplest
and
fewest
causes
it
is
still
certain
we
can
not
go
beyond
experience
and
any
hypothesis
that
pretends
to
discover
the
ultimate
original
qualities
of
human
nature
ought
at
first
to
be
rejected
as
presumptuous
and
chimerical
i
do
not
think
a
philosopher
who
would
apply
himself
so
earnestly
to
the
explaining
the
ultimate
principles
of
the
soul
would
show
himself
a
great
master
in
that
very
science
of
human
nature
which
he
pretends
to
explain
or
very
knowing
in
what
is
naturally
satisfactory
to
the
mind
of
man
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
despair
has
almost
the
same
effect
upon
us
with
enjoyment
and
that
we
are
no
sooner
acquainted
with
the
impossibility
of
satisfying
any
desire
than
the
desire
itself
vanishes
when
we
see
that
we
have
arrived
at
the
utmost
extent
of
human
reason
we
sit
down
contented
though
we
be
perfectly
satisfied
in
the
main
of
our
ignorance
and
perceive
that
we
can
give
no
reason
for
our
most
general
and
most
refined
principles
beside
our
experience
of
their
reality
which
is
the
reason
of
the
mere
vulgar
and
what
it
required
no
study
at
first
to
have
discovered
for
the
most
particular
and
most
extraordinary
phaenomenon
and
as
this
impossibility
of
making
any
farther
progress
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
reader
so
the
writer
may
derive
a
more
delicate
satisfaction
from
the
free
confession
of
his
ignorance
and
from
his
prudence
in
avoiding
that
error
into
which
so
many
have
fallen
of
imposing
their
conjectures
and
hypotheses
on
the
world
for
the
most
certain
principles
when
this
mutual
contentment
and
satisfaction
can
be
obtained
betwixt
the
master
and
scholar
i
know
not
what
more
we
can
require
of
our
philosophy
but
if
this
impossibility
of
explaining
ultimate
principles
should
be
esteemed
a
defect
in
the
science
of
man
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
it
is
a
defect
common
to
it
with
all
the
sciences
and
all
the
arts
in
which
we
can
employ
ourselves
whether
they
be
such
as
are
cultivated
in
the
schools
of
the
philosophers
or
practised
in
the
shops
of
the
meanest
artizans
none
of
them
can
go
beyond
experience
or
establish
any
principles
which
are
not
founded
on
that
authority
moral
philosophy
has
indeed
this
peculiar
disadvantage
which
is
not
found
in
natural
that
in
collecting
its
experiments
it
can
not
make
them
purposely
with
premeditation
and
after
such
a
manner
as
to
satisfy

disturb

establish
on

a

will
be
much
superior

the

in

which

enter

we

impressions

under
this
name
i
comprehend
all
our
sensations
passions
and
emotions

they
make
their
first
appearance
in
the
soul

ideas

the
faint
images
of
these
in
thinking

such
as
for
instance
are
all
the
perceptions
excited

the

discourse

only
those
which
arise
from
the
sight

touch

it
may

i
believe
it
will
not

very
necessary

employ
many
words

explaining
this
distinction
every
one
of
himself
will
readily
perceive
the
difference
betwixt
feeling
and
thinking
the
common
degrees
of
these
are
easily
distinguished
though
it
is
not
impossible

in
particular
instances
they
may
very
nearly
approach
to
each

our
impressions
as
on
the
other
hand
it
sometimes
happens
that
our
impressions
are
so
faint
and
low
that
we
can
not
distinguish
them
from
our
ideas
but
notwithstanding
this
near
resemblance
in
a
few
instances
they
are
in
general
so
very
different
that
can
make
a
scruple
to
rank
them
under
distinct
heads
and
assign
to
each
a
peculiar
name
to
mark
the
difference

i
here
make
use
of
these
terms
impression
and
idea
in
a
sense
different
from
what
is
usual
and
i
hope
this
liberty
will
be
allowed
me
perhaps
i
rather
restore
the
word
idea
to
its
original
sense
from
which
mr
locke
had
perverted
it
in
making
it
stand
for
all
our
perceptions
by
the
terms
of
impression
i
would
not
be
understood
to
express
the
manner
in
which
our
lively
perceptions
are
produced
in
the
soul
but
merely
the
perceptions
themselves
for
which
there
is
no
particular
name
either
in
the
english
or
any
other
language
that
i
know
of
there
is
another
division
of
our
perceptions
which
it
will
be
convenient
to
observe
and
which
extends
itself
both
to
our
impressions
and
ideas
this
division
is
into
simple
and
complex
simple
perceptions
or
impressions
and
ideas
are
such
as
admit
of
no
distinction
nor
separation
the
complex
are
the
contrary
to
these
and
may
be
distinguished
into
parts
though
a
particular
colour
taste
and
smell
are
qualities
all
united
together
in
this
apple
it
is
easy
to
perceive
they
are
not
the
same
but
are
at
least
distinguishable
from
each
other
having
by
these
divisions
given
an
order
and
arrangement
to
our
objects
we
may
now
apply
ourselves
to
consider
with
the
more
accuracy
their
qualities
and
relations
the
first
circumstance
that
strikes
my
eye
is
the
great
resemblance
betwixt
our
impressions
and
ideas
in
every
other
particular
except
their
degree
of
force
and
vivacity
the
one
seem
to
be
in
a
manner
the
reflexion
of
the
other
so
that
all
the
perceptions
of
the
mind
are
double
and
appear
both
as
impressions
and
ideas
when
i
shut
my
eyes
and
think
of
my
chamber
the
ideas
i
form
are
exact
representations
of
the
impressions
i
felt
nor
is
there
any
circumstance
of
the
one
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
other
in
running
over
my
other
perceptions
i
find
still
the
same
resemblance
and
representation
ideas
and
impressions
appear
always
to
correspond
to
each
other
this
circumstance
seems
to
me
remarkable
and
engages
my
attention
for
a
moment
upon
a
more
accurate
survey
i
find
i
have
been
carried
away
too
far
by
the
first
appearance
and
that
i
must
make
use
of
the
distinction
of
perceptions
into
simple
and
complex
to
limit
this
general
decision
that
all
our
ideas
and
impressions
are
resembling
i
observe
that
many
of
our
complex
ideas
never
had
impressions
that
corresponded
to
them
and
that
many
of
our
complex
impressions
never
are
exactly
copied
in
ideas
i
can
imagine
to
myself
such
a
city
as
the
new
jerusalem
whose
pavement
is
gold
and
walls
are
rubies
though
i
never
saw
any
such
i
have
seen
paris
but
shall
i
affirm
i
can
form
such
an
idea
of
that
city
as
will
perfectly
represent
all
its
streets
and
houses
in
their
real
and
just
proportions
i
perceive
therefore
that
though
there
is
in
general
a
great
resemblance
betwixt
our
complex
impressions
and
ideas
yet
the
rule
is
not
universally
true
that
they
are
exact
copies
of
each
other
we
may
next
consider
how
the
case
stands
with
our
simple
perceptions
after
the
most
accurate
examination
of
which
i
am
capable
i
venture
to
affirm
that
the
rule
here
holds
without
any
exception
and
that
every
simple
idea
has
a
simple
impression
which
resembles
it
and
every
simple
impression
a
correspondent
idea
that
idea
of
red
which
we
form
in
the
dark
and
that
impression
which
strikes
our
eyes
in
differ
only
in
degree
not
in
nature
that
the
case
is
the
same
with
all
our
simple
impressions
and
ideas
it
is
impossible
to
prove
by
a
particular
enumeration
of
them
every
one
may
satisfy
himself
in
this
point
by
running
over
as
many
as
he
pleases
but
if
any
one
should
deny
this
universal
resemblance
i
know
no
way
of
convincing
him
but
by
desiring
him
to
shew
a
simple
impression
that
has
not
a
correspondent
idea
or
a
simple
idea
that
has
not
a
correspondent
impression
if
he
does
not
answer
this
challenge
as
it
is
certain
he
can
not
we
may
from
his
silence
and
our
own
observation
establish
our
conclusion
thus
we
find
that
all
simple
ideas
and
impressions
resemble
each
other
and
as
the
complex
are
formed
from
them
we
may
affirm
in
general
that
these
two
species
of
perception
are
exactly
correspondent
having
discovered
this
relation
which
requires
no
farther
examination
i
am
curious
to
find
some
other
of
their
qualities
let
us
consider
how
they
stand
with
regard
to
their
existence
and
which
of
the
impressions
and
ideas
are
causes
and
which
effects
the
full
examination
of
this
question
is
the
subject
of
the
present
treatise
and
therefore
we
shall
here
content
ourselves
with
establishing
one
general
proposition
that
all
our
simple
ideas
in
their
first
appearance
are
derived
from
simple
impressions
which
are
correspondent
to
them
and
which
they
exactly
represent
in
seeking
for
phenomena
to
prove
this
proposition
i
find
only
those
of
two
kinds
but
in
each
kind
the
phenomena
are
obvious
numerous
and
conclusive
i
first
make
myself
certain
by
a
new
review
of
what
i
have
already
asserted
that
every
simple
impression
is
attended
with
a
correspondent
idea
and
every
simple
idea
with
a
correspondent
impression
from
this
constant
conjunction
of
resembling
perceptions
i
immediately
conclude
that
there
is
a
great
connexion
betwixt
our
correspondent
impressions
and
ideas
and
that
the
existence
of
the
one
has
a
considerable
influence
upon
that
of
the
other
such
a
constant
conjunction
in
such
an
infinite
number
of
instances
can
never
arise
from
chance
but
clearly
proves
a
dependence
of
the
impressions
on
the
ideas
or
of
the
ideas
on
the
impressions
that
i
may
know
on
which
side
this
dependence
lies
i
consider
the
order
of
their
first
appearance
and
find
by
constant
experience
that
the
simple
impressions
always
take
the
precedence
of
their
correspondent
ideas
but
never
appear
in
the
contrary
order
to
give
a
child
an
idea
of
scarlet
or
orange
of
sweet
or
bitter
i
present
the
objects
or
in
other
words
convey
to
him
these
impressions
but
proceed
not
so
absurdly
as
to
endeavour
to
produce
the
impressions
by
exciting
the
ideas
our
ideas
upon
their
appearance
produce
not
their
correspondent
impressions
nor
do
we
perceive
any
colour
or
feel
any
sensation
merely
upon
thinking
of
them
on
the
other
hand
we
find
that
any
impression
either
of
the
mind
or
body
is
constantly
followed
by
an
idea
which
resembles
it
and
is
only
different
in
the
degrees
of
force
and
liveliness
the
constant
conjunction
of
our
resembling
perceptions
is
a
convincing
proof
that
the
one
are
the
causes
of
the
other
and
this
priority
of
the
impressions
is
an
equal
proof
that
our
impressions
are
the
causes
of
our
ideas
not
our
ideas
of
our
impressions
to
confirm
this
i
consider
another
plain
and
convincing
phaenomenon
which
is
that
by
any
accident
the
faculties
which
give
rise
to
any
impressions
are
obstructed
in
their
operations
as
when
one
is
born
blind
or
deaf
not
only
the
impressions
are
lost
but
also
their
correspondent
ideas
so
that
there
never
appear
in
the
mind
the
least
traces
of
either
of
them
nor
is
this
only
true
where
the
organs
of
sensation
are
entirely
destroyed
but
likewise
where
they
have
never
been
put
in
action
to
produce
a
particular
impression
we
can
not
form
to
ourselves
a
just
idea
of
the
taste
of
a
pine
apple
without
having
actually
tasted
it
there
is
however
one
contradictory
phaenomenon
which
may
prove
that
it
is
not
absolutely
impossible
for
ideas
to
go
before
their
correspondent
impressions
i
believe
it
will
readily
be
allowed
that
the
several
distinct
ideas
of
colours
which
enter
by
the
eyes
or
those
of
sounds
which
are
conveyed
by
the
hearing
are
really
different
from
each
other
though
at
the
same
time
resembling
now
if
this
be
true
of
different
colours
it
must
be
no
less
so
of
the
different
shades
of
the
same
colour
that
each
of
them
produces
a
distinct
idea
independent
of
the
rest
for
if
this
should
be
denied
it
is
possible
by
the
continual
gradation
of
shades
to
run
a
colour
insensibly
into
what
is
most
remote
from
it
and
if
you
will
not
allow
any
of
the
means
to
be
different
you
can
not
without
absurdity
deny
the
extremes
to
be
the
same
suppose
therefore
a
person
to
have
enjoyed
his
sight
for
thirty
years
and
to
have
become
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
colours
of
all
kinds
excepting
one
particular
shade
of
blue
for
instance
which
it
never
has
been
his
fortune
to
meet
with
let
all
the
different
shades
of
that
colour
except
that
single
one
be
placed
before
him
descending
gradually
from
the
deepest
to
the
lightest
it
is
plain
that
he
will
perceive
a
blank
where
that
shade
is
wanting
said
will
be
sensible
that
there
is
a
greater
distance
in
that
place
betwixt
the
contiguous
colours
than
in
any
other
now
i
ask
whether
it
is
possible
for
him
from
his
own
imagination
to
supply
this
deficiency
and
raise
up
to
himself
the
idea
of
that
particular
shade
though
it
had
never
been
conveyed
to
him
by
his
senses
i
believe
there
are
few
but
will
be
of
opinion
that
he
can
and
this
may
serve
as
a
proof
that
the
simple
ideas
are
not
always
derived
from
the
correspondent
impressions
though
the
instance
is
so
particular
and
singular
that
it
is
scarce
worth
our
observing
and
does
not
merit
that
for
it
alone
we
should
alter
our
general
maxim
but
besides
this
exception
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
remark
on
this
head
that
the
principle
of
the
priority
of
impressions
to
ideas
must
be
understood
with
another
limitation
that
as
our
ideas
are
images
of
our
impressions
so
we
can
form
secondary
ideas
which
are
images
of
the
primary
as
appears
from
this
very
reasoning
concerning
them
this
is
not
properly
speaking
an
exception
to
the
rule
so
much
as
an
explanation
of
it
ideas
produce
the
images
of
themselves
in
new
ideas
but
as
the
first
ideas
are
supposed
to
be
derived
from
impressions
it
still
remains
true
that
all
our
simple
ideas
proceed
either
mediately
or
immediately
from
their
correspondent
impressions
this
then
is
the
first
principle
i
establish
in
the
science
of
human
nature
nor
ought
we
to
despise
it
because
of
the
simplicity
of
its
appearance
for
it
is
remarkable
that
the
present
question
concerning
the
precedency
of
our
impressions
or
ideas
is
the
same
with
what
has
made
so
much
noise
in
other
terms
when
it
has
been
disputed
whether
there
be
any
innate
ideas
or
whether
all
ideas
be
derived
from
sensation
and
reflexion
we
may
observe
that
in
order
to
prove
the
ideas
of
extension
and
colour
not
to
be
innate
philosophers
do
nothing
but
shew
that
they
are
conveyed
by
our
senses
to
prove
the
ideas
of
passion
and
desire
not
to
be
innate
they
observe
that
we
have
a
preceding
experience
of
these
emotions
in
ourselves
now
if
we
carefully
examine
these
arguments
we
shall
find
that
they
prove
nothing
but
that
ideas
are
preceded
by
other
more
lively
perceptions
from
which
the
are
derived
and
which
they
represent
i
hope
this
clear
stating
of
the
question
will
remove
all
disputes
concerning
it
and
win
render
this
principle
of
more
use
in
our
reasonings
than
it
seems
hitherto
to
have
been
sect
ii
division
of
the
subject
since
it
appears
that
our
simple
impressions
are
prior
to
their
correspondent
ideas
and
that
the
exceptions
are
very
rare
method
seems
to
require
we
should
examine
our
impressions
before
we
consider
our
ideas
impressions
way
be
divided
into
two
kinds
those
of
sensation
and
those
of
reflexion
the
first
kind
arises
in
the
soul
originally
from
unknown
causes
the
second
is
derived
in
a
great
measure
from
our
ideas
and
that
in
the
following
order
an
impression
first
strikes
upon
the
senses
and
makes
us
perceive
heat
or
cold
thirst
or
hunger
pleasure
or
pain
of
some
kind
or
other
of
this
impression
there
is
a
copy
taken
by
the
mind
which
remains
after
the
impression
ceases
and
this
we
call
an
idea
this
idea
of
pleasure
or
pain
when
it
returns
upon
the
soul
produces
the
new
impressions
of
desire
and
aversion
hope
and
fear
which
may
properly
be
called
impressions
of
reflexion
because
derived
from
it
these
again
are
copied
by
the
memory
and
imagination
and
become
ideas
which
perhaps
in
their
turn
give
rise
to
other
impressions
and
ideas
so
that
the
impressions
of
reflexion
are
only
antecedent
to
their
correspondent
ideas
but
posterior
to
those
of
sensation
and
derived
from
them
the
examination
of
our
sensations
belongs
more
to
anatomists
and
natural
philosophers
than
to
moral
and
therefore
shall
not
at
present
be
entered
upon
and
as
the
impressions
of
reflexion
viz
passions
desires
and
emotions
which
principally
deserve
our
attention
arise
mostly
from
ideas
it
will
be
necessary
to
reverse
that
method
which
at
first
sight
seems
most
natural
and
in
order
to
explain
the
nature
and
principles
of
the
human
mind
give
a
particular
account
of
ideas
before
we
proceed
to
impressions
for
this
reason
i
have
here
chosen
to
begin
with
ideas
sect
iii
of
the
ideas
of
the
memory
and
imagination
we
find
by
experience
that
when
any
impression
has
been
present
with
the
mind
it
again
makes
its
appearance
there
as
an
idea
and
this
it
may
do
after
two
different
ways
either
when
in
its
new
appearance
it
retains
a
considerable
degree
of
its
first
vivacity
and
is
somewhat
intermediate
betwixt
an
impression
and
an
idea
or
when
it
entirely
loses
that
vivacity
and
is
a
perfect
idea
the
faculty
by
which
we
repeat
our
impressions
in
the
first
manner
is
called
the
memory
and
the
other
the
imagination
it
is
evident
at
first
sight
that
the
ideas
of
the
memory
are
much
more
lively
and
strong
than
those
of
the
imagination
and
that
the
former
faculty
paints
its
objects
in
more
distinct
colours
than
any
which
are
employed
by
the
latter
when
we
remember
any
past
event
the
idea
of
it
flows
in
upon
the
mind
in
a
forcible
manner
whereas
in
the
imagination
the
perception
is
faint
and
languid
and
can
not
without
difficulty
be
preserved
by
the
mind
steddy
and
uniform
for
any
considerable
time
here
then
is
a
sensible
difference
betwixt
one
species
of
ideas
and
another
but
of
this
more
fully
hereafter
part
ii
sect
there
is
another
difference
betwixt
these
two
kinds
of
ideas
which
is
no
less
evident
namely
that
though
neither
the
ideas
of
the
memory
nor
imagination
neither
the
lively
nor
faint
ideas
can
make
their
appearance
in
the
mind
unless
their
correspondent
impressions
have
gone
before
to
prepare
the
way
for
them
yet
the
imagination
is
not
restrained
to
the
same
order
and
form
with
the
original
impressions
while
the
memory
is
in
a
manner
tied
down
in
that
respect
without
any
power
of
variation
it
is
evident
that
the
memory
preserves
the
original
form
in
which
its
objects
were
presented
and
that
we
depart
from
it
in
recollecting
any
thing
it
proceeds
from
some
defect
or
imperfection
in
that
faculty
an
historian
may
perhaps
for
the
more
convenient
carrying
on
of
his
narration
relate
an
event
before
another
to
which
it
was
in
fact
posterior
but
then
he
takes
notice
of
this
disorder
if
he
be
exact
and
by
that
means
replaces
the
idea
in
its
due
position
it
is
the
same
case
in
our
recollection
of
those
places
and
persons
with
which
we
were
formerly
acquainted
the
chief
exercise
of
the
memory
is
not
to
preserve
the
simple
ideas
but
their
order
and
position
in
short
this
principle
is
supported
by
such
a
number
of
common
and
vulgar
phaenomena
that
we
may
spare
ourselves
the
trouble
of
insisting
on
it
any
farther
the
same
evidence
follows
us
in
our
second
principle
of
the
liberty
of
the
imagination
to
transpose
and
change
its
ideas
the
fables
we
meet
with
in
poems
and
romances
put
this
entirely
out
of
the
question
nature
there
is
totally
confounded
and
nothing
mentioned
but
winged
horses
fiery
dragons
and
monstrous
giants
nor
will
this
liberty
of
the
fancy
appear
strange
when
we
consider
that
all
our
ideas
are
copyed
from
our
impressions
and
that
there
are
not
any
two
impressions
which
are
perfectly
inseparable
not
to
mention
that
this
is
an
evident
consequence
of
the
division
of
ideas
into
simple
and
complex
the
imagination
perceives
a
difference
among
ideas
it
can
easily
produce
a
separation
sect
iv
of
the
connexion
or
association
of
ideas
as
all
simple
ideas
may
be
separated
by
the
imagination
and
may
be
united
again
in
what
form
it
pleases
nothing
would
be
more
unaccountable
than
the
operations
of
that
faculty
were
it
not
guided
by
some
universal
principles
which
render
it
in
some
measure
uniform
with
itself
in
all
times
and
places
were
ideas
entirely
loose
and
unconnected
chance
alone
would
join
them
and
it
is
impossible
the
same
simple
ideas
should
fall
regularly
into
complex
ones
as
they
commonly
do
without
some
bond
of
union
among
them
some
associating
quality
by
which
one
idea
naturally
introduces
another
this
uniting
principle
among
ideas
is
not
to
be
considered
as
an
inseparable
connexion
for
that
has
been
already
excluded
from
the
imagination
nor
yet
are
we
to
conclude
that
without
it
the
mind
can
not
join
two
ideas
for
nothing
is
more
free
than
that
faculty
but
we
are
only
to
regard
it
as
a
gentle
force
which
commonly
prevails
and
is
the
cause
why
among
other
things
languages
so
nearly
correspond
to
each
other
nature
in
a
manner
pointing
out
to
every
one
those
simple
ideas
which
are
most
proper
to
be
united
in
a
complex
one
the
qualities
from
which
this
association
arises
and
by
which
the
mind
is
after
this
manner
conveyed
from
one
idea
to
another
are
three
viz
resemblance
contiguity
in
time
or
place
and
cause
and
effect
i
believe
it
will
not
be
very
necessary
to
prove
that
these
qualities
produce
an
association
among
ideas
and
upon
the
appearance
of
one
idea
naturally
introduce
another
it
is
plain
that
in
the
course
of
our
thinking
and
in
the
constant
revolution
of
our
ideas
our
imagination
runs
easily
from
one
idea
to
any
other
that
resembles
it
and
that
this
quality
alone
is
to
the
fancy
a
sufficient
bond
and
association
it
is
likewise
evident
that
as
the
senses
in
changing
their
objects
are
necessitated
to
change
them
regularly
and
take
them
as
they
lie
contiguous
to
each
other
the
imagination
must
by
long
custom
acquire
the
same
method
of
thinking
and
run
along
the
parts
of
space
and
time
in
conceiving
its
objects
as
to
the
connexion
that
is
made
by
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
we
shall
have
occasion
afterwards
to
examine
it
to
the
bottom
and
therefore
shall
not
at
present
insist
upon
it
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
there
is
no
relation
which
produces
a
stronger
connexion
in
the
fancy
and
makes
one
idea
more
readily
recall
another
than
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
betwixt
their
objects
that
we
may
understand
the
full
extent
of
these
relations
we
must
consider
that
two
objects
are
connected
together
in
the
imagination
not
only
when
the
one
is
immediately
resembling
contiguous
to
or
the
cause
of
the
other
but
also
when
there
is
interposed
betwixt
them
a
third
object
which
bears
to
both
of
them
any
of
these
relations
this
may
be
carried
on
to
a
great
length
though
at
the
same
time
we
may
observe
that
each
remove
considerably
weakens
the
relation
cousins
in
the
fourth
degree
are
connected
by
causation
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
use
that
term
but
not
so
closely
as
brothers
much
less
as
child
and
parent
in
general
we
may
observe
that
all
the
relations
of
blood
depend
upon
cause
and
effect
and
are
esteemed
near
or
remote
according
to
the
number
of
connecting
causes
interposed
betwixt
the
persons
of
the
three
relations
this
of
causation
is
the
most
extensive
two
objects
may
be
considered
as
placed
in
this
relation
as
well
when
one
is
the
cause
of
any
of
the
actions
or
motions
of
the
other
as
when
the
former
is
the
cause
of
the
existence
of
the
latter
for
as
that
action
or
motion
is
nothing
but
the
object
itself
considered
in
a
certain
light
and
as
the
object
continues
the
same
in
all
its
different
situations
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
such
an
influence
of
objects
upon
one
another
may
connect
them
in
the
imagination
we
may
carry
this
farther
and
remark
not
only
that
two
objects
are
connected
by
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
when
the
one
produces
a
motion
or
any
action
in
the
other
but
also
when
it
has
a
power
of
producing
it
and
this
we
may
observe
to
be
the
source
of
all
the
relation
of
interest
and
duty
by
which
men
influence
each
other
in
society
and
are
placed
in
the
ties
of
government
and
subordination
a
master
is
as
by
his
situation
arising
either
from
force
or
agreement
has
a
power
of
directing
in
certain
particulars
the
actions
of
another
whom
we
call
servant
a
judge
is
one
who
in
all
disputed
cases
can
fix
by
his
opinion
the
possession
or
property
of
any
thing
betwixt
any
members
of
the
society
when
a
person
is
possessed
of
any
power
there
is
no
more
required
to
convert
it
into
action
but
the
exertion
of
the
will
and
that
in
every
case
is
considered
as
possible
and
in
many
as
probable
especially
in
the
case
of
authority
where
the
obedience
of
the
subject
is
a
pleasure
and
advantage
to
the
superior
these
are
therefore
the
principles
of
union
or
cohesion
among
our
simple
ideas
and
in
the
imagination
supply
the
place
of
that
inseparable
connexion
by
which
they
are
united
in
our
memory
here
is
a
kind
of
attraction
which
in
the
mental
world
will
be
found
to
have
as
extraordinary
effects
as
in
the
natural
and
to
shew
itself
in
as
many
and
as
various
forms
its
effects
are
every
where
conspicuous
but
as
to
its
causes
they
are
mostly
unknown
and
must
be
resolved
into
original
qualities
of
human
nature
which
i
pretend
not
to
explain
nothing
is
more
requisite
for
a
true
philosopher
than
to
restrain
the
intemperate
desire
of
searching
into
causes
and
having
established
any
doctrine
upon
a
sufficient
number
of
experiments
rest
contented
with
that
when
he
sees
a
farther
examination
would
lead
him
into
obscure
and
uncertain
speculations
in
that
case
his
enquiry
would
be
much
better
employed
in
examining
the
effects
than
the
causes
of
his
principle
amongst
the
effects
of
this
union
or
association
of
ideas
there
are
none
more
remarkable
than
those
complex
ideas
which
are
the
common
subjects
of
our
thoughts
and
reasoning
and
generally
arise
from
some
principle
of
union
among
our
simple
ideas
these
complex
ideas
may
be
divided
into
relations
modes
and
substances
we
shall
briefly
examine
each
of
these
in
order
and
shall
subjoin
some
considerations
concerning
our
general
and
particular
ideas
before
we
leave
the
present
subject
which
may
be
considered
as
the
elements
of
this
philosophy
sect
of
relations
the
word
relation
is
commonly
used
in
two
senses
considerably
different
from
each
other
either
for
that
quality
by
which
two
ideas
are
connected
together
in
the
imagination
and
the
one
naturally
introduces
the
other
after
the
manner
or
for
that
particular
circumstance
in
which
even
upon
the
arbitrary
union
of
two
ideas
in
the
fancy
we
may
think
proper
to
compare
them
in
common
language
the
former
is
always
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
word
relation
and
it
is
only
in
philosophy
that
we
extend
it
to
mean
any
particular
subject
of
comparison
without
a
connecting
principle
thus
distance
will
be
allowed
by
philosophers
to
be
a
true
relation
because
we
acquire
an
idea
of
it
by
the
comparing
of
objects
but
in
a
common
way
we
say
that
nothing
can
be
more
distant
than
such
or
such
things
from
each
other
nothing
can
have
less
relation
as
if
distance
and
relation
were
incompatible
it
may
perhaps
be
esteemed
an
endless
task
to
enumerate
all
those
qualities
which
make
objects
admit
of
comparison
and
by
which
the
ideas
of
philosophical
relation
are
produced
but
if
we
diligently
consider
them
we
shall
find
that
without
difficulty
they
may
be
comprised
under
seven
general
heads
which
may
be
considered
as
the
sources
of
all
philosophical
relation
the
first
is
resemblance
and
this
is
a
relation
without
which
no
philosophical
relation
can
exist
since
no
objects
will
admit
of
comparison
but
what
have
some
degree
of
resemblance
but
though
resemblance
be
necessary
to
all
philosophical
relation
it
does
not
follow
that
it
always
produces
a
connexion
or
association
of
ideas
when
a
quality
becomes
very
general
and
is
common
to
a
great
many
individuals
it
leads
not
the
mind
directly
to
any
one
of
them
but
by
presenting
at
once
too
great
a
choice
does
thereby
prevent
the
imagination
from
fixing
on
any
single
object
identity
may
be
esteemed
a
second
species
of
relation
this
relation
i
here
consider
as
applied
in
its
strictest
sense
to
constant
and
unchangeable
objects
without
examining
the
nature
and
foundation
of
personal
identity
which
shall
find
its
place
afterwards
of
all
relations
the
most
universal
is
that
of
identity
being
common
to
every
being
whose
existence
has
any
duration
after
identity
the
most
universal
and
comprehensive
relations
are
those
of
space
and
time
which
are
the
sources
of
an
infinite
number
of
comparisons
such
as
distant
contiguous
above
below
before
after
etc
all
those
objects
which
admit
of
quantity
or
number
may
be
compared
in
that
particular
which
is
another
very
fertile
source
of
relation
when
any
two
objects
possess
the
same
quality
in
common
the
degrees
in
which
they
possess
it
form
a
fifth
species
of
relation
thus
of
two
objects
which
are
both
heavy
the
one
may
be
either
of
greater
or
less
weight
than
the
other
two
colours
that
are
of
the
same
kind
may
yet
be
of
different
shades
and
in
that
respect
admit
of
comparison
the
relation
of
contrariety
may
at
first
sight
be
regarded
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
no
relation
of
any
kind
can
subsist
without
some
degree
of
resemblance
but
let
us
consider
that
no
two
ideas
are
in
themselves
contrary
except
those
of
existence
and
which
are
plainly
resembling
as
implying
both
of
them
an
idea
of
the
object
though
the
latter
excludes
the
object
from
all
times
and
places
in
which
it
is
supposed
not
to
exist
all
other
objects
such
as
fire
and
water
heat
and
cold
are
only
found
to
be
contrary
from
experience
and
from
the
contrariety
of
their
causes
or
effects
which
relation
of
cause
and
effect
is
a
seventh
philosophical
relation
as
well
as
a
natural
one
the
resemblance
implied
in
this
relation
shall
be
explained
afterwards
it
might
naturally
be
expected
that
i
should
join
difference
to
the
other
relations
but
that
i
consider
rather
as
a
negation
of
relation
than
as
anything
real
or
positive
difference
is
of
two
kinds
as
opposed
either
to
identity
or
resemblance
the
first
is
called
a
difference
of
number
the
other
of
kind
sect
vi
of
modes
and
substances
i
would
fain
ask
those
philosophers
who
found
so
much
of
their
reasonings
on
the
distinction
of
substance
and
accident
and
imagine
we
have
clear
ideas
of
each
whether
the
idea
of
substance
be
derived
from
the
impressions
of
sensation
or
of
reflection
if
it
be
conveyed
to
us
by
our
senses
i
ask
which
of
them
and
after
what
manner
if
it
be
perceived
by
the
eyes
it
must
be
a
colour
if
by
the
ears
a
sound
if
by
the
palate
a
taste
and
so
of
the
other
senses
but
i
believe
none
will
assert
that
substance
is
either
a
colour
or
sound
or
a
taste
the
idea
of
substance
must
therefore
be
derived
from
an
impression
of
reflection
if
it
really
exist
but
the
impressions
of
reflection
resolve
themselves
into
our
passions
and
emotions
none
of
which
can
possibly
represent
a
substance
we
have
therefore
no
idea
of
substance
distinct
from
that
of
a
collection
of
particular
qualities
nor
have
we
any
other
meaning
when
we
either
talk
or
reason
concerning
it
the
idea
of
a
substance
as
well
as
that
of
a
mode
is
nothing
but
a
collection
of
simple
ideas
that
are
united
by
the
imagination
and
have
a
particular
name
assigned
them
by
which
we
are
able
to
recall
either
to
ourselves
or
others
that
collection
but
the
difference
betwixt
these
ideas
consists
in
this
that
the
particular
qualities
which
form
a
substance
are
commonly
referred
to
an
unknown
something
in
which
they
are
supposed
to
inhere
or
granting
this
fiction
should
not
take
place
are
at
least
supposed
to
be
closely
and
inseparably
connected
by
the
relations
of
contiguity
and
causation
the
effect
of
this
is
that
whatever
new
simple
quality
we
discover
to
have
the
same
connexion
with
the
rest
we
immediately
comprehend
it
among
them
even
though
it
did
not
enter
into
the
first
conception
of
the
substance
thus
our
idea
of
gold
may
at
first
be
a
yellow
colour
weight
malleableness
fusibility
but
upon
the
discovery
of
its
dissolubility
in
aqua
regia
we
join
that
to
the
other
qualities
and
suppose
it
to
belong
to
the
substance
as
much
as
if
its
idea
had
from
the
beginning
made
a
part
of
the
compound
one
the
principal
of
union
being
regarded
as
the
chief
part
of
the
complex
idea
gives
entrance
to
whatever
quality
afterwards
occurs
and
is
equally
comprehended
by
it
as
are
the
others
which
first
presented
themselves
that
this
can
not
take
place
in
modes
is
evident
from
considering
their
mature
the
simple
ideas
of
which
modes
are
formed
either
represent
qualities
which
are
not
united
by
contiguity
and
causation
but
are
dispersed
in
different
subjects
or
if
they
be
all
united
together
the
uniting
principle
is
not
regarded
as
the
foundation
of
the
complex
idea
the
idea
of
a
dance
is
an
instance
of
the
first
kind
of
modes
that
of
beauty
of
the
second
the
reason
is
obvious
why
such
complex
ideas
can
not
receive
any
new
idea
without
changing
the
name
which
distinguishes
the
mode
sect
vii
of
abstract
ideas
a
very
material
question
has
been
started
concerning
abstract
or
general
ideas
whether
they
be
general
or
particular
in
the
mind
conception
of
them
a
great
philosopher
dr
berkeley
has
disputed
the
received
opinion
in
this
particular
and
has
asserted
that
all
general
ideas
are
nothing
but
particular
ones
annexed
to
a
certain
term
which
gives
them
a
more
extensive
signification
and
makes
them
recall
upon
occasion
other
individuals
which
are
similar
to
them
as
i
look
upon
this
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
valuable
discoveries
that
has
been
made
of
late
years
in
the
republic
of
letters
i
shall
here
endeavour
to
confirm
it
by
some
arguments
which
i
hope
will
put
it
beyond
all
doubt
and
controversy
it
is
evident
that
in
forming
most
of
our
general
ideas
if
not
all
of
them
we
abstract
from
every
particular
degree
of
quantity
and
quality
and
that
an
object
ceases
not
to
be
of
any
particular
species
on
account
of
every
small
alteration
in
its
extension
duration
and
other
properties
it
may
therefore
be
thought
that
here
is
a
plain
dilemma
that
decides
concerning
the
nature
of
those
abstract
ideas
which
have
afforded
so
much
speculation
to
philosophers
the
abstract
idea
of
a
man
represents
men
of
all
sizes
and
all
qualities
which
it
is
concluded
it
can
not
do
but
either
by
representing
at
once
all
possible
sizes
and
all
possible
qualities
or
by
representing
no
particular
one
at
all
now
it
having
been
esteemed
absurd
to
defend
the
former
proposition
as
implying
an
infinite
capacity
in
the
mind
it
has
been
commonly
inferred
in
favour
of
the
latter
and
our
abstract
ideas
have
been
supposed
to
represent
no
particular
degree
either
of
quantity
or
quality
but
that
this
inference
is
erroneous
i
shall
endeavour
to
make
appear
first
by
proving
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
conceive
any
quantity
or
quality
without
forming
a
precise
notion
of
its
degrees
and
secondly
by
showing
that
though
the
capacity
of
the
mind
be
not
infinite
yet
we
can
at
once
form
a
notion
of
all
possible
degrees
of
quantity
and
quality
in
such
a
manner
at
least
as
however
imperfect
may
serve
all
the
purposes
of
reflection
and
conversation
to
begin
with
the
first
proposition
that
the
mind
can
not
form
any
notion
of
quantity
or
quality
without
forming
a
precise
notion
of
degrees
of
each
we
may
prove
this
by
the
three
following
arguments
first
we
have
observed
that
whatever
objects
are
different
are
distinguishable
and
that
whatever
objects
are
distinguishable
are
separable
by
the
thought
and
imagination
and
we
may
here
add
that
these
propositions
are
equally
true
in
the
inverse
and
that
whatever
objects
are
separable
are
also
distinguishable
and
that
whatever
objects
are
distinguishable
are
also
different
for
how
is
it
possible
we
can
separate
what
is
not
distinguishable
or
distinguish
what
is
not
different
in
order
therefore
to
know
whether
abstraction
implies
a
separation
we
need
only
consider
it
in
this
view
and
examine
whether
all
the
circumstances
which
we
abstract
from
in
our
general
ideas
be
such
as
are
distinguishable
and
different
from
those
which
we
retain
as
essential
parts
of
them
but
it
is
evident
at
first
sight
that
the
precise
length
of
a
line
is
not
different
nor
distinguishable
from
the
line
itself
nor
the
precise
degree
of
any
quality
from
the
quality
these
ideas
therefore
admit
no
more
of
separation
than
they
do
of
distinction
and
difference
they
are
consequently
conjoined
with
each
other
in
the
conception
and
the
general
idea
of
a
line
notwithstanding
all
our
abstractions
and
refinements
has
in
its
appearance
in
the
mind
a
precise
degree
of
quantity
and
quality
however
it
may
be
made
to
represent
others
which
have
different
degrees
of
both
secondly
it
is
contest
that
no
object
can
appear
to
the
senses
or
in
other
words
that
no
impression
can
become
present
to
the
mind
without
being
determined
in
its
degrees
both
of
quantity
and
quality
the
confusion
in
which
impressions
are
sometimes
involved
proceeds
only
from
their
faintness
and
unsteadiness
not
from
any
capacity
in
the
mind
to
receive
any
impression
which
in
its
real
existence
has
no
particular
degree
nor
proportion
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
even
implies
the
flattest
of
all
contradictions
viz
that
it
is
possible
for
the
same
thing
both
to
be
and
not
to
be
now
since
all
ideas
are
derived
from
impressions
and
are
nothing
but
copies
and
representations
of
them
whatever
is
true
of
the
one
must
be
acknowledged
concerning
the
other
impressions
and
ideas
differ
only
in
their
strength
and
vivacity
the
foregoing
conclusion
is
not
founded
on
any
particular
degree
of
vivacity
it
can
not
therefore
be
affected
by
any
variation
in
that
particular
an
idea
is
a
weaker
impression
and
as
a
strong
impression
must
necessarily
have
a
determinate
quantity
and
quality
the
case
must
be
the
same
with
its
copy
or
representative
thirdly
it
is
a
principle
generally
received
in
philosophy
that
everything
in
nature
is
individual
and
that
it
is
utterly
absurd
to
suppose
a
triangle
really
existent
which
has
no
precise
proportion
of
sides
and
angles
if
this
therefore
be
absurd
in
fact
and
reality
it
must
also
be
absurd
in
idea
since
nothing
of
which
we
can
form
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
is
absurd
and
impossible
but
to
form
the
idea
of
an
object
and
to
form
an
idea
simply
is
the
same
thing
the
reference
of
the
idea
to
an
object
being
an
extraneous
denomination
of
which
in
itself
it
bears
no
mark
or
character
now
as
it
is
impossible
to
form
an
idea
of
an
object
that
is
possest
of
quantity
and
quality
and
yet
is
possest
of
no
precise
degree
of
either
it
follows
that
there
is
an
equal
impossibility
of
forming
an
idea
that
is
not
limited
and
confined
in
both
these
particulars
abstract
ideas
are
therefore
in
themselves
individual
however
they
may
become
general
in
their
representation
the
image
in
the
mind
is
only
that
of
a
particular
object
though
the
application
of
it
in
our
reasoning
be
the
same
as
if
it
were
universal
this
application
of
ideas
beyond
their
nature
proceeds
from
our
collecting
all
their
possible
degrees
of
quantity
and
quality
in
such
an
imperfect
manner
as
may
serve
the
purposes
of
life
which
is
the
second
proposition
i
proposed
to
explain
when
we
have
found
a
resemblance
footnote
among
several
objects
that
often
occur
to
us
we
apply
the
same
name
to
all
of
them
whatever
differences
we
may
observe
in
the
degrees
of
their
quantity
and
quality
and
whatever
other
differences
may
appear
among
them
after
we
have
acquired
a
custom
of
this
kind
the
hearing
of
that
name
revives
the
idea
of
one
of
these
objects
and
makes
the
imagination
conceive
it
with
all
its
particular
circumstances
and
proportions
but
as
the
same
word
is
supposed
to
have
been
frequently
applied
to
other
individuals
that
are
different
in
many
respects
from
that
idea
which
is
immediately
present
to
the
mind
the
word
not
being
able
to
revive
the
idea
of
all
these
individuals
but
only
touches
the
soul
if
i
may
be
allowed
so
to
speak
and
revives
that
custom
which
we
have
acquired
by
surveying
them
they
are
not
really
and
in
fact
present
to
the
mind
but
only
in
power
nor
do
we
draw
them
all
out
distinctly
in
the
imagination
but
keep
ourselves
in
a
readiness
to
survey
any
of
them
as
we
may
be
prompted
by
a
present
design
or
necessity
the
word
raises
up
an
individual
idea
along
with
a
certain
custom
and
that
custom
produces
any
other
individual
one
for
which
we
may
have
occasion
but
as
the
production
of
all
the
ideas
to
which
the
name
may
be
applied
is
in
most
eases
impossible
we
abridge
that
work
by
a
more
partial
consideration
and
find
but
few
inconveniences
to
arise
in
our
reasoning
from
that
abridgment
footnote
it
is
evident
that
even
different
simple
ideas
may
have
a
similarity
or
resemblance
to
each
other
nor
is
it
necessary
that
the
point
or
circumstance
of
resemblance
shoud
be
distinct
or
separable
from
that
in
which
they
differ
blue
and
green
are
different
simple
ideas
but
are
more
resembling
than
blue
and
scarlet
tho
their
perfect
simplicity
excludes
all
possibility
of
separation
or
distinction
it
is
the
same
case
with
particular
sounds
and
tastes
and
smells
these
admit
of
infinite
resemblances
upon
the
general
appearance
and
comparison
without
having
any
common
circumstance
the
same
and
of
this
we
may
be
certain
even
from
the
very
abstract
terms
simple
idea
they
comprehend
all
simple
ideas
under
them
these
resemble
each
other
in
their
simplicity
and
yet
from
their
very
nature
which
excludes
all
composition
this
circumstance
in
which
they
resemble
is
not
distinguishable
nor
separable
from
the
rest
it
is
the
same
case
with
all
the
degrees
in
any
quality
they
are
all
resembling
and
yet
the
quality
in
any
individual
is
not
distinct
from
the
degree
for
this
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances
in
the
present
affair
that
after
the
mind
has
produced
an
individual
idea
upon
which
we
reason
the
attendant
custom
revived
by
the
general
or
abstract
term
readily
suggests
any
other
individual
if
by
chance
we
form
any
reasoning
that
agrees
not
with
it
thus
should
we
mention
the
word
triangle
and
form
the
idea
of
a
particular
equilateral
one
to
correspond
to
it
and
should
we
afterwards
assert
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
each
other
the
other
individuals
of
a
scalenum
and
isosceles
which
we
overlooked
at
first
immediately
crowd
in
upon
us
and
make
us
perceive
the
falshood
of
this
proposition
though
it
be
true
with
relation
to
that
idea
which
we
had
formed
if
the
mind
suggests
not
always
these
ideas
upon
occasion
it
proceeds
from
some
imperfection
in
its
faculties
and
such
a
one
as
is
often
the
source
of
false
reasoning
and
sophistry
but
this
is
principally
the
case
with
those
ideas
which
are
abstruse
and
compounded
on
other
occasions
the
custom
is
more
entire
and
it
is
seldom
we
run
into
such
errors
nay
so
entire
is
the
custom
that
the
very
same
idea
may
be
annext
to
several
different
words
and
may
be
employed
in
different
reasonings
without
any
danger
of
mistake
thus
the
idea
of
an
equilateral
triangle
of
an
inch
perpendicular
may
serve
us
in
talking
of
a
figure
of
a
rectilinear
figure
of
a
regular
figure
of
a
triangle
and
of
an
equilateral
triangle
all
these
terms
therefore
are
in
this
case
attended
with
the
same
idea
but
as
they
are
wont
to
be
applied
in
a
greater
or
lesser
compass
they
excite
their
particular
habits
and
thereby
keep
the
mind
in
a
readiness
to
observe
that
no
conclusion
be
formed
contrary
to
any
ideas
which
are
usually
comprized
under
them
before
those
habits
have
become
entirely
perfect
perhaps
the
mind
may
not
be
content
with
forming
the
idea
of
only
one
individual
but
may
run
over
several
in
order
to
make
itself
comprehend
its
own
meaning
and
the
compass
of
that
collection
which
it
intends
to
express
by
the
general
term
that
we
may
fix
the
meaning
of
the
word
figure
we
may
revolve
in
our
mind
the
ideas
of
circles
squares
parallelograms
triangles
of
different
sizes
and
proportions
and
may
not
rest
on
one
image
or
idea
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
we
form
the
idea
of
individuals
whenever
we
use
any
general
term
that
we
seldom
or
never
can
exhaust
these
individuals
and
that
those
which
remain
are
only
represented
by
means
of
that
habit
by
which
we
recall
them
whenever
any
present
occasion
requires
it
this
then
is
the
nature
of
our
abstract
ideas
and
general
terms
and
it
is
after
this
manner
we
account
for
the
foregoing
paradox
that
some
ideas
are
particular
in
their
nature
but
general
in
their
representation
a
particular
idea
becomes
general
by
being
annexed
to
a
general
term
that
is
to
a
term
which
from
a
customary
conjunction
has
a
relation
to
many
other
particular
ideas
and
readily
recalls
them
in
the
imagination
the
only
difficulty
that
can
remain
on
this
subject
must
be
with
regard
to
that
custom
which
so
readily
recalls
every
particular
idea
for
which
we
may
have
occasion
and
is
excited
by
any
word
or
sound
to
which
we
commonly
annex
it
the
most
proper
method
in
my
opinion
of
giving
a
satisfactory
explication
of
this
act
of
the
mind
is
by
producing
other
instances
which
are
analogous
to
it
and
other
principles
which
facilitate
its
operation
to
explain
the
ultimate
causes
of
our
mental
actions
is
impossible
it
is
sufficient
if
we
can
give
any
satisfactory
account
of
them
from
experience
and
analogy
first
then
i
observe
that
when
we
mention
any
great
number
such
as
a
thousand
the
mind
has
generally
no
adequate
idea
of
it
but
only
a
power
of
producing
such
an
idea
by
its
adequate
idea
of
the
decimals
under
which
the
number
is
comprehended
this
imperfection
however
in
our
ideas
is
never
felt
in
our
reasonings
which
seems
to
be
an
instance
parallel
to
the
present
one
of
universal
ideas
secondly
we
have
several
instances
of
habits
which
may
be
revived
by
one
single
word
as
when
a
person
who
has
by
rote
any
periods
of
a
discourse
or
any
number
of
verses
will
be
put
in
remembrance
of
the
whole
which
he
is
at
a
loss
to
recollect
by
that
single
word
or
expression
with
which
they
begin
thirdly
i
believe
every
one
who
examines
the
situation
of
his
mind
in
reasoning
will
agree
with
me
that
we
do
not
annex
distinct
and
compleat
ideas
to
every
term
we
make
use
of
and
that
in
talking
of
government
church
negotiation
conquest
we
seldom
spread
out
in
our
minds
all
the
simple
ideas
of
which
these
complex
ones
are
composed
it
is
however
observable
that
notwithstanding
this
imperfection
we
may
avoid
talking
nonsense
on
these
subjects
and
may
perceive
any
repugnance
among
the
ideas
as
well
as
if
we
had
a
fall
comprehension
of
them
thus
if
instead
of
saying
that
in
war
the
weaker
have
always
recourse
to
negotiation
we
should
say
that
they
have
always
recourse
to
conquest
the
custom
which
we
have
acquired
of
attributing
certain
relations
to
ideas
still
follows
the
words
and
makes
us
immediately
perceive
the
absurdity
of
that
proposition
in
the
same
manner
as
one
particular
idea
may
serve
us
in
reasoning
concerning
other
ideas
however
different
from
it
in
several
circumstances
fourthly
as
the
individuals
are
collected
together
said
placed
under
a
general
term
with
a
view
to
that
resemblance
which
they
bear
to
each
other
this
relation
must
facilitate
their
entrance
in
the
imagination
and
make
them
be
suggested
more
readily
upon
occasion
and
indeed
if
we
consider
the
common
progress
of
the
thought
either
in
reflection
or
conversation
we
shall
find
great
reason
to
be
satisfyed
in
this
particular
nothing
is
more
admirable
than
the
readiness
with
which
the
imagination
suggests
its
ideas
and
presents
them
at
the
very
instant
in
which
they
become
necessary
or
useful
the
fancy
runs
from
one
end
of
the
universe
to
the
other
in
collecting
those
ideas
which
belong
to
any
subject
one
would
think
the
whole
intellectual
world
of
ideas
was
at
once
subjected
to
our
view
and
that
we
did
nothing
but
pick
out
such
as
were
most
proper
for
our
purpose
there
may
not
however
be
any
present
beside
those
very
ideas
that
are
thus
collected
by
a
kind
of
magical
faculty
in
the
soul
which
though
it
be
always
most
perfect
in
the
greatest
geniuses
and
is
properly
what
we
call
a
genius
is
however
inexplicable
by
the
utmost
efforts
of
human
understanding
perhaps
these
four
reflections
may
help
to
remove
an
difficulties
to
the
hypothesis
i
have
proposed
concerning
abstract
ideas
so
contrary
to
that
which
has
hitherto
prevailed
in
philosophy
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
place
my
chief
confidence
in
what
i
have
already
proved
concerning
the
impossibility
of
general
ideas
according
to
the
common
method
of
explaining
them
we
must
certainly
seek
some
new
system
on
this
head
and
there
plainly
is
none
beside
what
i
have
proposed
if
ideas
be
particular
in
their
nature
and
at
the
same
time
finite
in
their
number
it
is
only
by
custom
they
can
become
general
in
their
representation
and
contain
an
infinite
number
of
other
ideas
under
them
before
i
leave
this
subject
i
shall
employ
the
same
principles
to
explain
that
distinction
of
reason
which
is
so
much
talked
of
and
is
so
little
understood
in
the
schools
of
this
kind
is
the
distinction
betwixt
figure
and
the
body
figured
motion
and
the
body
moved
the
difficulty
of
explaining
this
distinction
arises
from
the
principle
above
explained
that
all
ideas
which
are
different
are
separable
for
it
follows
from
thence
that
if
the
figure
be
different
from
the
body
their
ideas
must
be
separable
as
well
as
distinguishable
if
they
be
not
different
their
ideas
can
neither
be
separable
nor
distinguishable
what
then
is
meant
by
a
distinction
of
reason
since
it
implies
neither
a
difference
nor
separation
to
remove
this
difficulty
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
foregoing
explication
of
abstract
ideas
it
is
certain
that
the
mind
would
never
have
dreamed
of
distinguishing
a
figure
from
the
body
figured
as
being
in
reality
neither
distinguishable
nor
different
nor
separable
did
it
not
observe
that
even
in
this
simplicity
there
might
be
contained
many
different
resemblances
and
relations
thus
when
a
globe
of
white
marble
is
presented
we
receive
only
the
impression
of
a
white
colour
disposed
in
a
certain
form
nor
are
we
able
to
separate
and
distinguish
the
colour
from
the
form
but
observing
afterwards
a
globe
of
black
marble
and
a
cube
of
white
and
comparing
them
with
our
former
object
we
find
two
separate
resemblances
in
what
formerly
seemed
and
really
is
perfectly
inseparable
after
a
little
more
practice
of
this
kind
we
begin
to
distinguish
the
figure
from
the
colour
by
a
distinction
of
reason
that
is
we
consider
the
figure
and
colour
together
since
they
are
in
effect
the
same
and
undistinguishable
but
still
view
them
in
different
aspects
according
to
the
resemblances
of
which
they
are
susceptible
when
we
would
consider
only
the
figure
of
the
globe
of
white
marble
we
form
in
reality
an
idea
both
of
the
figure
and
colour
but
tacitly
carry
our
eye
to
its
resemblance
with
the
globe
of
black
marble
and
in
the
same
manner
when
we
would
consider
its
colour
only
we
turn
our
view
to
its
resemblance
with
the
cube
of
white
marble
by
this
means
we
accompany
our
ideas
with
a
kind
of
reflection
of
which
custom
renders
us
in
a
great
measure
insensible
a
person
who
desires
us
to
consider
the
figure
of
a
globe
of
white
marble
without
thinking
on
its
colour
desires
an
impossibility
but
his
meaning
is
that
we
should
consider
the
figure
and
colour
together
but
still
keep
in
our
eye
the
resemblance
to
the
globe
of
black
marble
or
that
to
any
other
globe

colour
or
substance

whatever
has
the
air
of
a
paradox
and
is
contrary
to

and
most
unprejudiced
notions
of

often
greedily
embraced
by
philosophers
as
shewing
the
superiority

discover
opinions
so
remote

vulgar
conception
on
the

hand
anything
proposed
to
us

causes
surprize
and
admiration

such
a
satisfaction
to
the
mind
that
it
indulges
itself
in

agreeable
emotions

will

that

pleasure
is
entirely
without

these
dispositions

and
their
disciples
arises
that
mutual
complaisance
betwixt
them
while
the
former
furnish
such
plenty
of
strange
and
unaccountable
opinions
and
the
latter
so
readily
believe
them
of
this
mutual
complaisance
i
can
not
give
a
more
evident
instance
than
in
the
doctrine
of
infinite
divisibility
with
the
examination
of
which
i
shall
begin
this
subject
of
the
ideas
of
space
and
time
it
is
universally
allowed
that
the
capacity
of
the
mind
is
limited
and
can
never
attain
a
full
and
adequate
conception
of
infinity
and
though
it
were
not
allowed
it
would
be
sufficiently
evident
from
the
plainest
observation
and
experience
it
is
also
obvious
that
whatever
is
capable
of
being
divided
in
infinitum
must
consist
of
an
infinite
number
of
parts
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
set
any
bounds
to
the
number
of
parts
without
setting
bounds
at
the
same
time
to
the
division
it
requires
scarce
any
induction
to
conclude
from
hence
that
the
idea
which
we
form
of
any
finite
quality
is
not
infinitely
divisible
but
that
by
proper
distinctions
and
separations
we
may
run
up
this
idea
to
inferior
ones
which
will
be
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
in
rejecting
the
infinite
capacity
of
the
mind
we
suppose
it
may
arrive
at
an
end
in
the
division
of
its
ideas
nor
are
there
any
possible
means
of
evading
the
evidence
of
this
conclusion
it
is
therefore
certain
that
the
imagination
reaches
a
minimum
and
may
raise
up
to
itself
an
idea
of
which
it
can
not
conceive
any
and
which
can
not
be
diminished
without
a
total
annihilation
when
you
tell
me
of
the
thousandth
and
ten
thousandth
part
of
a
grain
of
sand
i
have
a
distinct
idea
of
these
numbers
and
of
their
different
proportions
but
the
images
which
i
form
in
my
mind
to
represent
the
things
themselves
are
nothing
different
from
each
other
nor
inferior
to
that
image
by
which
i
represent
the
grain
of
sand
itself
which
is
supposed
so
vastly
to
exceed
them
what
consists
of
parts
is
distinguishable
into
them
and
what
is
distinguishable
is
separable
but
whatever
we
may
imagine
of
the
thing
the
idea
of
a
grain
of
sand
is
not
distinguishable
nor
separable
into
twenty
much
less
into
a
thousand
ten
thousand
or
an
infinite
number
of
different
ideas
it
is
the
same
case
with
the
impressions
of
the
senses
as
with
the
ideas
of
the
imagination
put
a
spot
of
ink
upon
paper
fix
your
eye
upon
that
spot
and
retire
to
such
a
distance
that
at
last
you
lose
sight
of
it
it
is
plain
that
the
moment
before
it
vanished
the
image
or
impression
was
perfectly
indivisible
it
is
not
for
want
of
rays
of
light
striking
on
our
eyes
that
the
minute
parts
of
distant
bodies
convey
not
any
sensible
impression
but
because
they
are
removed
beyond
that
distance
at
which
their
impressions
were
reduced
to
a
minimum
and
were
incapable
of
any
farther
diminution
a
microscope
or
telescope
which
renders
them
visible
produces
not
any
new
rays
of
light
but
only
spreads
those
which
always
flowed
from
them
and
by
that
means
both
gives
parts
to
impressions
which
to
the
naked
eye
appear
simple
and
uncompounded
and
advances
to
a
minimum
what
was
formerly
imperceptible
we
may
hence
discover
the
error
of
the
common
opinion
that
the
capacity
of
the
mind
is
limited
on
both
sides
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
imagination
to
form
an
adequate
idea
of
what
goes
beyond
a
certain
degree
of
minuteness
as
well
as
of
greatness
nothing
can
be
more
minute
than
some
ideas
which
we
form
in
the
fancy
and
images
which
appear
to
the
senses
since
there
are
ideas
and
images
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
the
only
defect
of
our
senses
is
that
they
give
us
disproportioned
images
of
things
and
represent
as
minute
and
uncompounded
what
is
really
great
and
composed
of
a
vast
number
of
parts
this
mistake
we
are
not
sensible
of
but
taking
the
impressions
of
those
minute
objects
which
appear
to
the
senses
to
be
equal
or
nearly
equal
to
the
objects
and
finding
by
reason
that
there
are
other
objects
vastly
more
minute
we
too
hastily
conclude
that
these
are
inferior
to
any
idea
of
our
imagination
or
impression
of
our
senses
this
however
is
certain
that
we
can
form
ideas
which
shall
be
no
greater
than
the
smallest
atom
of
the
animal
spirits
of
an
insect
a
thousand
times
less
than
a
mite
and
we
ought
rather
to
conclude
that
the
difficulty
lies
in
enlarging
our
conceptions
so
much
as
to
form
a
just
notion
of
a
mite
or
even
of
an
insect
a
thousand
times
less
than
a
mite
for
in
order
to
form
a
just
notion
of
these
animals
we
must
have
a
distinct
idea
representing
every
part
of
them
which
according
to
the
system
of
infinite
divisibility
is
utterly
impossible
and
recording
to
that
of
indivisible
parts
or
atoms
is
extremely
difficult
by
reason
of
the
vast
number
and
multiplicity
of
these
parts
sect
ii
of
the
infinite
divisibility
of
space
and
time
wherever
ideas
are
adequate
representations
of
objects
the
relations
contradictions
and
agreements
of
the
ideas
are
all
applicable
to
the
objects
and
this
we
may
in
general
observe
to
be
the
foundation
of
all
human
knowledge
but
our
ideas
are
adequate
representations
of
the
most
minute
parts
of
extension
and
through
whatever
divisions
and
subdivisions
we
may
suppose
these
parts
to
be
arrived
at
they
can
never
become
inferior
to
some
ideas
which
we
form
the
plain
consequence
is
that
whatever
appears
impossible
and
contradictory
upon
the
comparison
of
these
ideas
must
be
really
impossible
and
contradictory
without
any
farther
excuse
or
evasion
every
thing
capable
of
being
infinitely
divided
contains
an
infinite
number
of
parts
otherwise
the
division
would
be
stopt
short
by
the
indivisible
parts
which
we
should
immediately
arrive
at
if
therefore
any
finite
extension
be
infinitely
divisible
it
can
be
no
contradiction
to
suppose
that
a
finite
extension
contains
an
infinite
number
of
parts
and
vice
versa
if
it
be
a
contradiction
to
suppose
that
a
finite
extension
contains
an
infinite
number
of
parts
no
finite
extension
can
be
infinitely
divisible
but
that
this
latter
supposition
is
absurd
i
easily
convince
myself
by
the
consideration
of
my
clear
ideas
i
first
take
the
least
idea
i
can
form
of
a
part
of
extension
and
being
certain
that
there
is
nothing
more
minute
than
this
idea
i
conclude
that
whatever
i
discover
by
its
means
must
be
a
real
quality
of
extension
i
then
repeat
this
idea
once
twice
thrice
and
find
the
compound
idea
of
extension
arising
from
its
repetition
always
to
augment
and
become
double
triple
quadruple
till
at
last
it
swells
up
to
a
considerable
bulk
greater
or
smaller
in
proportion
as
i
repeat
more
or
less
the
same
idea
when
i
stop
in
the
addition
of
parts
the
idea
of
extension
ceases
to
augment
and
were
i
to
carry
on
the
addition
in
infinitum
i
clearly
perceive
that
the
idea
of
extension
must
also
become
infinite
upon
the
whole
i
conclude
that
the
idea
of
all
infinite
number
of
parts
is
individually
the
same
idea
with
that
of
an
infinite
extension
that
no
finite
extension
is
capable
of
containing
an
infinite
number
of
parts
and
consequently
that
no
finite
extension
is
infinitely
divisible

it
has
been
objected
to
me
that
infinite
divisibility
supposes
only
an
infinite
number
of
proportional
not
of
aliqiot
parts
and
that
an
infinite
number
of
proportional
parts
does
not
form
an
infinite
extension
but
this
distinction
is
entirely
frivolous
whether
these
parts
be
calld
aliquot
or
proportional
they
can
not
be
inferior
to
those
minute
parts
we
conceive
and
therefore
can
not
form
a
less
extension
by
their
conjunction
i
may
subjoin
another
argument
proposed
by
a
noted
author
mons
malezieu
which
seems
to
me
very
strong
and
beautiful
it
is
evident
that
existence
in
itself
belongs
only
to
unity
and
is
never
applicable
to
number
but
on
account
of
the
unites
of
which
the
number
is
composed
twenty
men
may
be
said
to
exist
but
it
is
only
because
one
two
three
four
are
existent
and
if
you
deny
the
existence
of
the
latter
that
of
the
former
falls
of
course
it
is
therefore
utterly
absurd
to
suppose
any
number
to
exist
and
yet
deny
the
existence
of
unites
and
as
extension
is
always
a
number
according
to
the
common
sentiment
of
metaphysicians
and
never
resolves
itself
into
any
unite
or
indivisible
quantity
it
follows
that
extension
can
never
at
all
exist
it
is
in
vain
to
reply
that
any
determinate
quantity
of
extension
is
an
unite
but
as
admits
of
an
infinite
number
of
fractions
and
is
inexhaustible
in
its
for
by
the
same
rule
these
twenty
men
may
be
considered
as
a
unit
the
whole
globe
of
the
earth
nay
the
whole
universe
may
be
considered
as
a
unit
that
term
of
unity
is
merely
a
fictitious
denomination
which
the
mind
may
apply
to
any
quantity
of
objects
it
collects
together
nor
can
such
an
unity
any
more
exist
alone
than
number
can
as
being
in
reality
a
true
number
but
the
unity
which
can
exist
alone
and
whose
existence
is
necessary
to
that
of
all
number
is
of
another
kind
and
must
be
perfectly
indivisible
and
incapable
of
being
resolved
into
any
lesser
unity
all
this
reasoning
takes
place
with
regard
to
time
along
with
an
additional
argument
which
it
may
be
proper
to
take
notice
of
it
is
a
property
inseparable
from
time
and
which
in
a
manner
constitutes
its
essence
that
each
of
its
parts
succeeds
another
and
that
none
of
them
however
contiguous
can
ever
be
for
the
same
reason
that
the
year
can
not
concur
with
the
present
year
every
moment
must
be
distinct
from
and
posterior
or
antecedent
to
another
it
is
certain
then
that
time
as
it
exists
must
be
composed
of
indivisible
moments
for
if
in
time
we
could
never
arrive
at
an
end
of
division
and
if
each
moment
as
it
succeeds
another
were
not
perfectly
single
and
indivisible
there
would
be
an
infinite
number
of
moments
or
parts
of
time
which
i
believe
will
be
allowed
to
be
an
arrant
contradiction
the
infinite
divisibility
of
space
implies
that
of
time
as
is
evident
from
the
nature
of
motion
if
the
latter
therefore
be
impossible
the
former
must
be
equally
so
i
doubt
not
but
it
will
readily
be
allowed
by
the
most
obstinate
defender
of
the
doctrine
of
infinite
divisibility
that
these
arguments
are
difficulties
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
answer
to
them
which
will
be
perfectly
clear
and
satisfactory
but
here
we
may
observe
that
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
this
custom
of
calling
a
difficulty
what
pretends
to
be
a
demonstration
and
endeavouring
by
that
means
to
elude
its
force
and
evidence
it
is
not
in
demonstrations
as
in
probabilities
that
difficulties
can
take
place
and
one
argument
another
and
diminish
its
authority
a
demonstration
if
just
admits
of
no
opposite
difficulty
and
if
not
just
it
is
a
mere
sophism
and
consequently
can
never
be
a
difficulty
it
is
either
irresistible
or
has
no
manner
of
force
to
talk
therefore
of
objections
and
replies
and
ballancing
of
arguments
in
such
a
question
as
this
is
to
confess
either
that
human
reason
is
nothing
but
a
play
of
words
or
that
the
person
himself
who
talks
so
has
not
a
capacity
equal
to
such
subjects
demonstrations
may
be
difficult
to
be
comprehended
because
of
abstractedness
of
the
subject
but
can
never
have
such
difficulties
as
will
weaken
their
authority
when
once
they
are
comprehended
it
is
true
mathematicians
are
wont
to
say
that
there
are
here
equally
strong
arguments
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
that
the
doctrine
of
indivisible
points
is
also
liable
to
unanswerable
objections
before
i
examine
these
arguments
and
objections
in
detail
i
will
here
take
them
in
a
body
and
endeavour
by
a
short
and
decisive
reason
to
prove
at
once
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
they
can
have
any
just
foundation
it
is
an
established
maxim
in
metaphysics
that
whatever
the
mind
clearly
conceives
includes
the
idea
of
possible
existence
or
in
other
words
that
nothing
we
imagine
is
absolutely
impossible
we
can
form
the
idea
of
a
golden
mountain
and
from
thence
conclude
that
such
a
mountain
may
actually
exist
we
can
form
no
idea
of
a
mountain
without
a
valley
and
therefore
regard
it
as
impossible
now
it
is
certain
we
have
an
idea
of
extension
for
otherwise
why
do
we
talk
and
reason
concerning
it
it
is
likewise
certain
that
this
idea
as
conceived
by
the
imagination
though
divisible
into
parts
or
inferior
ideas
is
not
infinitely
divisible
nor
consists
of
an
infinite
number
of
parts
for
that
exceeds
the
comprehension
of
our
limited
capacities
here
then
is
an
idea
of
extension
which
consists
of
parts
or
inferior
ideas
that
are
perfectly
indivisible
consequently
this
idea
implies
no
contradiction
consequently
it
is
possible
for
extension
really
to
exist
conformable
to
it
and
consequently
all
the
arguments
employed
against
the
possibility
of
mathematical
points
are
mere
scholastick
quibbles
and
unworthy
of
our
attention
these
consequences
we
may
carry
one
step
farther
and
conclude
that
all
the
pretended
demonstrations
for
the
infinite
divisibility
of
extension
are
equally
sophistical
since
it
is
certain
these
demonstrations
can
not
be
just
without
proving
the
impossibility
of
mathematical
points
which
it
is
an
evident
absurdity
to
pretend
to
sect
iii
of
the
other
qualities
of
our
idea
of
space
and
time
no
discovery
coued
have
been
made
more
happily
for
deciding
all
controversies
concerning
ideas
than
that
abovementioned
that
impressions
always
take
the
precedency
of
them
and
that
every
idea
with
which
the
imagination
is
furnished
first
makes
its
appearance
in
a
correspondent
impression
these
latter
perceptions
are
all
so
clear
and
evident
that
they
admit
of
no
controversy
though
many
of
our
ideas
are
so
obscure
that
it
is
almost
impossible
even
for
the
mind
which
forms
them
to
tell
exactly
their
nature
and
composition
let
us
apply
this
principle
in
order
to
discover
farther
the
nature
of
our
ideas
of
space
and
time
upon
opening
my
eyes
and
turning
them
to
the
surrounding
objects
i
perceive
many
visible
bodies
and
upon
shutting
them
again
and
considering
the
distance
betwixt
these
bodies
i
acquire
the
idea
of
extension
as
every
idea
is
derived
from
some
impression
which
is
exactly
similar
to
it
the
impressions
similar
to
this
idea
of
extension
must
either
be
some
sensations
derived
from
the
sight
or
some
internal
impressions
arising
from
these
sensations
our
internal
impressions
are
our
passions
emotions
desires
and
aversions
none
of
which
i
believe
will
ever
be
asserted
to
be
the
model
from
which
the
idea
of
space
is
derived
there
remains
therefore
nothing
but
the
senses
which
can
convey
to
us
this
original
impression
now
what
impression
do
oar
senses
here
convey
to
us
this
is
the
principal
question
and
decides
without
appeal
concerning
the
nature
of
the
idea
the
table
before
me
is
alone
sufficient
by
its
view
to
give
me
the
idea
of
extension
this
idea
then
is
borrowed
from
and
represents
some
impression
which
this
moment
appears
to
the
senses
but
my
senses
convey
to
me
only
the
impressions
of
coloured
points
disposed
in
a
certain
manner
if
the
eye
is
sensible
of
any
thing
farther
i
desire
it
may
be
pointed
out
to
me
but
if
it
be
impossible
to
shew
any
thing
farther
we
may
conclude
with
certainty
that
the
idea
of
extension
is
nothing
but
a
copy
of
these
coloured
points
and
of
the
manner
of
their
appearance
suppose
that
in
the
extended
object
or
composition
of
coloured
points
from
which
we
first
received
the
idea
of
extension
the
points
were
of
a
purple
colour
it
follows
that
in
every
repetition
of
that
idea
we
would
not
only
place
the
points
in
the
same
order
with
respect
to
each
other
but
also
bestow
on
them
that
precise
colour
with
which
alone
we
are
acquainted
but
afterwards
having
experience
of
the
other
colours
of
violet
green
red
white
black
and
of
all
the
different
compositions
of
these
and
finding
a
resemblance
in
the
disposition
of
coloured
points
of
which
they
are
composed
we
omit
the
peculiarities
of
colour
as
far
as
possible
and
found
an
abstract
idea
merely
on
that
disposition
of
points
or
manner
of
appearance
in
which
they
agree
nay
even
when
the
resemblance
is
carryed
beyond
the
objects
of
one
sense
and
the
impressions
of
touch
are
found
to
be
similar
to
those
of
sight
in
the
disposition
of
their
parts
this
does
not
hinder
the
abstract
idea
from
representing
both
upon
account
of
their
resemblance
all
abstract
ideas
are
really
nothing
but
particular
ones
considered
in
a
certain
light
but
being
annexed
to
general
terms
they
are
able
to
represent
a
vast
variety
and
to
comprehend
objects
which
as
they
are
alike
in
some
particulars
are
in
others
vastly
wide
of
each
other
the
idea
of
time
being
derived
from
the
succession
of
our
perceptions
of
every
kind
ideas
as
well
as
impressions
and
impressions
of
reflection
as
well
as
of
sensations
will
afford
us
an
instance
of
an
abstract
idea
which
comprehends
a
still
greater
variety
than
that
of
space
and
yet
is
represented
in
the
fancy
by
some
particular
individual
idea
of
a
determinate
quantity
and
quality
as
it
is
from
the
disposition
of
visible
and
tangible
objects
we
receive
the
idea
of
space
so
from
the
succession
of
ideas
and
impressions
we
form
the
idea
of
time
nor
is
it
possible
for
time
alone
ever
to
make
its
appearance
or
be
taken
notice
of
by
the
mind
a
man
in
a
sound
sleep
or
strongly
occupyed
with
one
thought
is
insensible
of
time
and
according
as
his
perceptions
succeed
each
other
with
greater
or
less
rapidity
the
same
duration
appears
longer
or
shorter
to
his
imagination
it
has
been
remarked
by
a
great
philosopher
that
our
perceptions
have
certain
bounds
in
this
particular
which
are
fixed
by
the
original
nature
and
constitution
of
the
mind
and
beyond
which
no
influence
of
external
objects
on
the
senses
is
ever
able
to
hasten
or
retard
our
thought
if
you
wheel
about
a
burning
coal
with
rapidity
it
will
present
to
the
senses
an
image
of
a
circle
of
fire
nor
will
there
seem
to
be
any
interval
of
time
betwixt
its
revolutions
meerly
because
it
is
impossible
for
our
perceptions
to
succeed
each
other
with
the
same
rapidity
that
motion
may
be
communicated
to
external
objects
wherever
we
have
no
successive
perceptions
we
have
no
notion
of
time
even
though
there
be
a
real
succession
in
the
objects
from
these
phenomena
as
well
as
from
many
others
we
may
conclude
that
time
can
not
make
its
appearance
to
the
mind
either
alone
or
attended
with
a
steady
unchangeable
object
but
is
always
discovered
some
perceivable
succession
of
changeable
objects
to
confirm
this
we
may
add
the
following
argument
which
to
me
seems
perfectly
decisive
and
convincing
it
is
evident
that
time
or
duration
consists
of
different
parts
for
otherwise
we
coued
not
conceive
a
longer
or
shorter
duration
it
is
also
evident
that
these
parts
are
not
for
that
quality
of
the
of
parts
belongs
to
extension
and
is
what
distinguishes
it
from
duration
now
as
time
is
composed
of
parts
that
are
not
coexistent
an
unchangeable
object
since
it
produces
none
but
coexistent
impressions
produces
none
that
can
give
us
the
idea
of
time
and
consequently
that
idea
must
be
derived
from
a
succession
of
changeable
objects
and
time
in
its
first
appearance
can
never
be
severed
from
such
a
succession
having
therefore
found
that
time
in
its
first
appearance
to
the
mind
is
always
conjoined
with
a
succession
of
changeable
objects
and
that
otherwise
it
can
never
fall
under
our
notice
we
must
now
examine
whether
it
can
be
conceived
without
our
conceiving
any
succession
of
objects
and
whether
it
can
alone
form
a
distinct
idea
in
the
imagination
in
order
to
know
whether
any
objects
which
are
joined
in
impression
be
inseparable
in
idea
we
need
only
consider
if
they
be
different
from
each
other
in
which
case
it
is
plain
they
may
be
conceived
apart
every
thing
that
is
different
is
distinguishable
and
everything
that
is
distinguishable
may
be
separated
according
to
the
maxims
if
on
the
contrary
they
be
not
different
they
are
not
distinguishable
and
if
they
be
not
distinguishable
they
can
not
be
separated
but
this
is
precisely
the
case
with
respect
to
time
compared
with
our
successive
perceptions
the
idea
of
time
is
not
derived
from
a
particular
impression
mixed
up
with
others
and
plainly
distinguishable
from
them
but
arises
altogether
from
the
manner
in
which
impressions
appear
to
the
mind
without
making
one
of
the
number
five
notes
played
on
a
flute
give
us
the
impression
and
idea
of
time
though
time
be
not
a
sixth
impression
which
presents
itself
to
the
hearing
or
any
other
of
the
senses
nor
is
it
a
sixth
impression
which
the
mind
by
reflection
finds
in
itself
these
five
sounds
making
their
appearance
in
this
particular
manner
excite
no
emotion
in
the
mind
nor
produce
an
affection
of
any
kind
which
being
observed
by
it
can
give
rise
to
a
new
idea
for
that
is
necessary
to
produce
a
new
idea
of
reflection
nor
can
the
mind
by
revolving
over
a
thousand
times
all
its
ideas
of
sensation
ever
extract
from
them
any
new
original
idea
unless
nature
has
so
framed
its
faculties
that
it
feels
some
new
original
impression
arise
from
such
a
contemplation
but
here
it
only
takes
notice
of
the
manner
in
which
the
different
sounds
make
their
appearance
and
that
it
may
afterwards
consider
without
considering
these
particular
sounds
but
may
conjoin
it
with
any
other
objects
the
ideas
of
some
objects
it
certainly
must
have
nor
is
it
possible
for
it
without
these
ideas
ever
to
arrive
at
any
conception
of
time
which
since
it
appears
not
as
any
primary
distinct
impression
can
plainly
be
nothing
but
different
ideas
or
impressions
or
objects
disposed
in
a
certain
manner
that
is
succeeding
each
other
i
know
there
are
some
who
pretend
that
the
idea
of
duration
is
applicable
in
a
proper
sense
to
objects
which
are
perfectly
unchangeable
and
this
i
take
to
be
the
common
opinion
of
philosophers
as
well
as
of
the
vulgar
but
to
be
convinced
of
its
falsehood
we
need
but
reflect
on
the
foregoing
conclusion
that
the
idea
of
duration
is
always
derived
from
a
succession
of
changeable
objects
and
can
never
be
conveyed
to
the
mind
by
any
thing
stedfast
and
unchangeable
for
it
inevitably
follows
from
thence
that
since
the
idea
of
duration
can
not
be
derived
from
such
an
object
it
can
any
propriety
or
exactness
be
applied
to
it
nor
can
any
thing
unchangeable
be
ever
said
to
have
duration
ideas
always
represent
the
objects
or
impressions
from
which
they
are
derived
and
can
never
without
a
fiction
represent
or
be
applied
to
any
other
by
what
fiction
we
apply
the
idea
of
time
even
to
what
is
unchangeable
and
suppose
as
is
common
that
duration
is
a
measure
of
rest
as
well
as
of
motion
we
shall
consider
sect
afterwards
there
is
another
very
decisive
argument
which
establishes
the
present
doctrine
concerning
our
ideas
of
space
and
time
and
is
founded
only
on
that
simple
principle
that
our
ideas
of
them
are
compounded
of
parts
which
are
indivisible
this
argument
may
be
worth
the
examining
every
idea
that
is
distinguishable
being
also
separable
let
us
take
one
of
those
simple
indivisible
ideas
of
which
the
compound
one
of
extension
is
formed
and
separating
it
from
all
others
and
considering
it
apart
let
us
form
a
judgment
of
its
nature
and
qualities
it
is
plain
it
is
not
the
idea
of
extension
for
the
idea
of
extension
consists
of
parts
and
this
idea
according
to
supposition
is
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
is
it
therefore
nothing
that
is
absolutely
impossible
for
as
the
compound
idea
of
extension
which
is
real
is
composed
of
such
ideas
were
these
so
many
there
would
be
a
real
existence
composed
of
which
is
absurd
here
therefore
i
must
ask
what
is
our
idea
of
a
simple
and
indivisible
point
no
wonder
if
my
answer
appear
somewhat
new
since
the
question
itself
has
scarce
ever
yet
been
thought
of
we
are
wont
to
dispute
concerning
the
nature
of
mathematical
points
but
seldom
concerning
the
nature
of
their
ideas
the
idea
of
space
is
conveyed
to
the
mind
by
two
senses
the
sight
and
touch
nor
does
anything
ever
appear
extended
that
is
not
either
visible
or
tangible
that
compound
impression
which
represents
extension
consists
of
several
lesser
impressions
that
are
indivisible
to
the
eye
or
feeling
and
may
be
called
impressions
of
atoms
or
corpuscles
endowed
with
colour
and
solidity
but
this
is
not
all
it
is
not
only
requisite
that
these
atoms
should
be
coloured
or
tangible
in
order
to
discover
themselves
to
our
senses
it
is
also
necessary
we
should
preserve
the
idea
of
their
colour
or
tangibility
in
order
to
comprehend
them
by
our
imagination
there
is
nothing
but
the
idea
of
their
colour
or
tangibility
which
can
render
them
conceivable
by
the
mind
upon
the
removal
of
the
ideas
of
these
sensible
qualities
they
are
utterly
annihilated
to
the
thought
or
imagination
now
such
as
the
parts
are
such
is
the
whole
if
a
point
be
not
considered
as
coloured
or
tangible
it
can
convey
to
us
no
idea
and
consequently
the
idea
of
extension
which
is
composed
of
the
ideas
of
these
points
can
never
possibly
exist
but
if
the
idea
of
extension
really
can
exist
as
we
are
conscious
it
does
its
parts
must
also
exist
and
in
order
to
that
must
be
considered
as
coloured
or
tangible
we
have
therefore
no
idea
of
space
or
extension
but
when
we
regard
it
as
an
object
either
of
our
sight
or
feeling
the
same
reasoning
will
prove
that
the
indivisible
moments
of
time
must
be
filled
with
some
real
object
or
existence
whose
succession
forms
the
duration
and
makes
it
be
conceivable
by
the
mind
sect
iv
objections
answered
our
system
concerning
space
and
time
consists
of
two
parts
which
are
intimately
connected
together
the
first
depends
on
this
chain
of
reasoning
the
capacity
of
the
mind
is
not
infinite
consequently
no
idea
of
extension
or
duration
consists
of
an
infinite
number
of
parts
or
inferior
ideas
but
of
a
finite
number
and
these
simple
and
indivisible
it
is
therefore
possible
for
space
and
time
to
exist
conformable
to
this
idea
and
if
it
be
possible
it
is
certain
they
actually
do
exist
conformable
to
it
since
their
infinite
divisibility
is
utterly
impossible
and
contradictory
the
other
part
of
our
system
is
a
consequence
of
this
the
parts
into
which
the
ideas
of
space
and
time
resolve
themselves
become
at
last
indivisible
and
these
indivisible
parts
being
nothing
in
themselves
are
inconceivable
when
not
filled
with
something
real
and
existent
the
ideas
of
space
and
time
are
therefore
no
separate
or
distinct
ideas
but
merely
those
of
the
manner
or
order
in
which
objects
exist
or
in
other
words
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
either
a
vacuum
and
extension
without
matter
or
a
time
when
there
was
no
succession
or
change
in
any
real
existence
the
intimate
connexion
betwixt
these
parts
of
our
system
is
the
reason
why
we
shall
examine
together
the
objections
which
have
been
urged
against
both
of
them
beginning
with
those
against
the
finite
divisibility
of
extension
i
the
first
of
these
objections
which
i
shall
take
notice
of
is
more
proper
to
prove
this
connexion
and
dependence
of
the
one
part
upon
the
other
than
to
destroy
either
of
them
it
has
often
been
maintained
in
the
schools
that
extension
must
be
divisible
in
infinitum
because
the
system
of
mathematical
points
is
absurd
and
that
system
is
absurd
because
a
mathematical
point
is
a
and
consequently
can
never
by
its
conjunction
with
others
form
a
real
existence
this
would
be
perfectly
decisive
were
there
no
medium
betwixt
the
infinite
divisibility
of
matter
and
the
of
mathematical
points
but
there
is
evidently
a
medium
viz
the
bestowing
a
colour
or
solidity
on
these
points
and
the
absurdity
of
both
the
extremes
is
a
demonstration
of
the
truth
and
reality
of
this
medium
the
system
of
physical
points
which
is
another
medium
is
too
absurd
to
need
a
refutation
a
real
extension
such
as
a
physical
point
is
supposed
to
be
can
never
exist
without
parts
different
from
each
other
and
wherever
objects
are
different
they
are
distinguishable
and
separable
by
the
imagination
ii
the
second
objection
is
derived
from
the
necessity
there
would
be
of
penetration
if
extension
consisted
of
mathematical
points
a
simple
and
indivisible
atom
that
touches
another
must
necessarily
penetrate
it
for
it
is
impossible
it
can
touch
it
by
its
external
parts
from
the
very
supposition
of
its
perfect
simplicity
which
excludes
all
parts
it
must
therefore
touch
it
intimately
and
in
its
whole
essence
secundum
se
tota
et
totaliter
which
is
the
very
definition
of
penetration
but
penetration
is
impossible
mathematical
points
are
of
consequence
equally
impossible
i
answer
this
objection
by
substituting
a
juster
idea
of
penetration
suppose
two
bodies
containing
no
void
within
their
circumference
to
approach
each
other
and
to
unite
in
such
a
manner
that
the
body
which
results
from
their
union
is
no
more
extended
than
either
of
them
it
is
this
we
must
mean
when
we
talk
of
penetration
but
it
is
evident
this
penetration
is
nothing
but
the
annihilation
of
one
of
these
bodies
and
the
preservation
of
the
other
without
our
being
able
to
distinguish
particularly
which
is
preserved
and
which
annihilated
before
the
approach
we
have
the
idea
of
two
bodies
after
it
we
have
the
idea
only
of
one
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
to
preserve
any
notion
of
difference
betwixt
two
bodies
of
the
same
nature
existing
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
taking
then
penetration
in
this
sense
for
the
annihilation
of
one
body
upon
its
approach
to
another
i
ask
any
one
if
he
sees
a
necessity
that
a
coloured
or
tangible
point
should
be
annihilated
upon
the
approach
of
another
coloured
or
tangible
point
on
the
contrary
does
he
not
evidently
perceive
that
from
the
union
of
these
points
there
results
an
object
which
is
compounded
and
divisible
and
may
be
distinguished
into
two
parts
of
which
each
preserves
its
existence
distinct
and
separate
notwithstanding
its
contiguity
to
the
other
let
him
aid
his
fancy
by
conceiving
these
points
to
be
of
different
colours
the
better
to
prevent
their
coalition
and
confusion
a
blue
and
a
red
point
may
surely
lie
contiguous
without
any
penetration
or
annihilation
for
if
they
can
not
what
possibly
can
become
of
them
whether
shall
the
red
or
the
blue
be
annihilated
or
if
these
colours
unite
into
one
what
new
colour
will
they
produce
by
their
union
what
chiefly
gives
rise
to
these
objections
and
at
the
same
time
renders
it
so
difficult
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
them
is
the
natural
infirmity
and
unsteadiness
both
of
our
imagination
and
senses
when
employed
on
such
minute
objects
put
a
spot
of
ink
upon
paper
and
retire
to
such
a
distance
that
the
spot
becomes
altogether
invisible
you
will
find
that
upon
your
return
and
nearer
approach
the
spot
first
becomes
visible
by
short
intervals
and
afterwards
becomes
always
visible
and
afterwards
acquires
only
a
new
force
in
its
colouring
without
augmenting
its
bulk
and
afterwards
when
it
has
encreased
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
really
extended
it
is
still
difficult
for
the
imagination
to
break
it
into
its
component
parts
because
of
the
uneasiness
it
finds
in
the
conception
of
such
a
minute
object
as
a
single
point
this
infirmity
affects
most
of
our
reasonings
on
the
present
subject
and
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
answer
in
an
intelligible
manner
and
in
proper
expressions
many
questions
which
may
arise
concerning
it
iii
there
have
been
many
objections
drawn
from
the
mathematics
against
the
indivisibility
of
the
parts
of
extension
though
at
first
sight
that
science
seems
rather
favourable
to
the
present
doctrine
and
if
it
be
contrary
in
its
demonstrations
it
is
perfectly
conformable
in
its
definitions
my
present
business
then
must
be
to
defend
the
definitions
and
refute
the
demonstrations
a
surface
is
defined
to
be
length
and
breadth
without
depth
a
line
to
be
length
without
breadth
or
depth
a
point
to
be
what
has
neither
length
breadth
nor
depth
it
is
evident
that
all
this
is
perfectly
unintelligible
upon
any
other
supposition
than
that
of
the
composition
of
extension
by
indivisible
points
or
atoms
how
else
coued
any
thing
exist
without
length
without
breadth
or
without
depth
two
different
answers
i
find
have
been
made
to
this
argument
neither
of
which
is
in
my
opinion
satisfactory
the
first
is
that
the
objects
of
geometry
those
surfaces
lines
and
points
whose
proportions
and
positions
it
examines
are
mere
ideas
in
the
mind
i
and
not
only
never
did
but
never
can
exist
in
nature
they
never
did
exist
for
no
one
will
pretend
to
draw
a
line
or
make
a
surface
entirely
conformable
to
the
definition
they
never
can
exist
for
we
may
produce
demonstrations
from
these
very
ideas
to
prove
that
they
are
impossible
but
can
anything
be
imagined
more
absurd
and
contradictory
than
this
reasoning
whatever
can
be
conceived
by
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
necessarily
implies
the
possibility
of
existence
and
he
who
pretends
to
prove
the
impossibility
of
its
existence
by
any
argument
derived
from
the
clear
idea
in
reality
asserts
that
we
have
no
clear
idea
of
it
because
we
have
a
clear
idea
it
is
in
vain
to
search
for
a
contradiction
in
any
thing
that
is
distinctly
conceived
by
the
mind
did
it
imply
any
contradiction
it
is
impossible
it
coued
ever
be
conceived
there
is
therefore
no
medium
betwixt
allowing
at
least
the
possibility
of
indivisible
points
and
denying
their
idea
and
it
is
on
this
latter
principle
that
the
second
answer
to
the
foregoing
argument
is
founded
it
has
been
pretended
de
penser
that
though
it
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
length
without
any
breadth
yet
by
an
abstraction
without
a
separation
we
can
consider
the
one
without
regarding
the
other
in
the
same
manner
as
we
may
think
of
the
length
of
the
way
betwixt
two
towns
and
overlook
its
breadth
the
length
is
inseparable
from
the
breadth
both
in
nature
and
in
our
minds
but
this
excludes
not
a
partial
consideration
and
a
distinction
of
reason
after
the
manner
above
explained
in
refuting
this
answer
i
shall
not
insist
on
the
argument
which
i
have
already
sufficiently
explained
that
if
it
be
impossible
for
the
mind
to
arrive
at
a
minimum
in
its
ideas
its
capacity
must
be
infinite
in
order
to
comprehend
the
infinite
number
of
parts
of
which
its
idea
of
any
extension
would
be
composed
i
shall
here
endeavour
to
find
some
new
absurdities
in
this
reasoning
a
surface
terminates
a
solid
a
line
terminates
a
surface
a
point
terminates
a
line
but
i
assert
that
if
the
ideas
of
a
point
line
or
surface
were
not
indivisible
it
is
impossible
we
should
ever
conceive
these
terminations
for
let
these
ideas
be
supposed
infinitely
divisible
and
then
let
the
fancy
endeavour
to
fix
itself
on
the
idea
of
the
last
surface
line
or
point
it
immediately
finds
this
idea
to
break
into
parts
and
upon
its
seizing
the
last
of
these
parts
it
loses
its
hold
by
a
new
division
and
so
on
in
infinitum
without
any
possibility
of
its
arriving
at
a
concluding
idea
the
number
of
fractions
bring
it
no
nearer
the
last
division
than
the
first
idea
it
formed
every
particle
eludes
the
grasp
by
a
new
fraction
like
quicksilver
when
we
endeavour
to
seize
it
but
as
in
fact
there
must
be
something
which
terminates
the
idea
of
every
finite
quantity
and
as
this
terminating
idea
can
not
itself
consist
of
parts
or
inferior
ideas
otherwise
it
would
be
the
last
of
its
parts
which
finished
the
idea
and
so
on
this
is
a
clear
proof
that
the
ideas
of
surfaces
lines
and
points
admit
not
of
any
division
those
of
surfaces
in
depth
of
lines
in
breadth
and
depth
and
of
points
in
any
dimension
the
school
were
so
sensible
of
the
force
of
this
argument
that
some
of
them
maintained
that
nature
has
mixed
among
those
particles
of
matter
which
are
divisible
in
infinitum
a
number
of
mathematical
points
in
order
to
give
a
termination
to
bodies
and
others
eluded
the
force
of
this
reasoning
by
a
heap
of
unintelligible
cavils
and
distinctions
both
these
adversaries
equally
yield
the
victory
a
man
who
hides
himself
confesses
as
evidently
the
superiority
of
his
enemy
as
another
who
fairly
delivers
his
arms
thus
it
appears
that
the
definitions
of
mathematics
destroy
the
pretended
demonstrations
and
that
if
we
have
the
idea
of
indivisible
points
lines
and
surfaces
conformable
to
the
definition
their
existence
is
certainly
possible
but
if
we
have
no
such
idea
it
is
impossible
we
can
ever
conceive
the
termination
of
any
figure
without
which
conception
there
can
be
no
geometrical
demonstration
but
i
go
farther
and
maintain
that
none
of
these
demonstrations
can
have
sufficient
weight
to
establish
such
a
principle
as
this
of
infinite
divisibility
and
that
because
with
regard
to
such
minute
objects
they
are
not
properly
demonstrations
being
built
on
ideas
which
are
not
exact
and
maxims
which
are
not
precisely
true
when
geometry
decides
anything
concerning
the
proportions
of
quantity
we
ought
not
to
look
for
the
utmost
precision
and
exactness
none
of
its
proofs
extend
so
far
it
takes
the
dimensions
and
proportions
of
figures
justly
but
roughly
and
with
some
liberty
its
errors
are
never
considerable
nor
would
it
err
at
all
did
it
not
aspire
to
such
an
absolute
perfection
i
first
ask
mathematicians
what
they
mean
when
they
say
one
line
or
surface
is
equal
to
or
greater
or
less
than
another
let
any
of
them
give
an
answer
to
whatever
sect
he
belongs
and
whether
he
maintains
the
composition
of
extension
by
indivisible
points
or
by
quantities
divisible
in
infinitum
this
question
will
embarrass
both
of
them
there
are
few
or
no
mathematicians
who
defend
the
hypothesis
of
indivisible
points
and
yet
these
have
the
readiest
and
justest
answer
to
the
present
question
they
need
only
reply
that
lines
or
surfaces
are
equal
when
the
numbers
of
points
in
each
are
equal
and
that
as
the
proportion
of
the
numbers
varies
the
proportion
of
the
lines
and
surfaces
is
also
varyed
but
though
this
answer
be
just
as
well
as
obvious
yet
i
may
affirm
that
this
standard
of
equality
is
entirely
useless
and
that
it
never
is
from
such
a
comparison
we
determine
objects
to
be
equal
or
unequal
with
respect
to
each
other
for
as
the
points
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
any
line
or
surface
whether
perceived
by
the
sight
or
touch
are
so
minute
and
so
confounded
with
each
other
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
the
mind
to
compute
their
number
such
a
computation
will
never
afford
us
a
standard
by
which
we
may
judge
of
proportions
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
determine
by
an
exact
numeration
that
an
inch
has
fewer
points
than
a
foot
or
a
foot
fewer
than
an
ell
or
any
greater
measure
for
which
reason
we
seldom
or
never
consider
this
as
the
standard
of
equality
or
inequality
as
to
those
who
imagine
that
extension
is
divisible
in
infinitum
it
is
impossible
they
can
make
use
of
this
answer
or
fix
the
equality
of
any
line
or
surface
by
a
numeration
of
its
component
parts
for
since
according
to
their
hypothesis
the
least
as
well
as
greatest
figures
contain
an
infinite
number
of
parts
and
since
infinite
numbers
properly
speaking
can
neither
be
equal
nor
unequal
with
respect
to
each
other
the
equality
or
inequality
of
any
portions
of
space
can
never
depend
on
any
proportion
in
the
number
of
their
parts
it
is
true
it
may
be
said
that
the
inequality
of
an
ell
and
a
yard
consists
in
the
different
numbers
of
the
feet
of
which
they
are
composed
and
that
of
a
foot
and
a
yard
in
the
number
of
the
inches
but
as
that
quantity
we
call
an
inch
in
the
one
is
supposed
equal
to
what
we
call
an
inch
in
the
other
and
as
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
to
find
this
equality
by
proceeding
in
infinitum
with
these
references
to
inferior
quantities
it
is
evident
that
at
last
we
must
fix
some
standard
of
equality
different
from
an
enumeration
of
the
parts
there
are
some
see
barrow
mathematical
lectures
who
pretend
that
equality
is
best
defined
by
congruity
and
that
any
two
figures
are
equal
when
upon
the
placing
of
one
upon
the
other
all
their
parts
correspond
to
and
touch
each
other
in
order
to
judge
of
this
definition
let
us
consider
that
since
equality
is
a
relation
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
a
property
in
the
figures
themselves
but
arises
merely
from
the
comparison
which
the
mind
makes
betwixt
them
if
it
consists
therefore
in
this
imaginary
application
and
mutual
contact
of
parts
we
must
at
least
have
a
distinct
notion
of
these
parts
and
must
conceive
their
contact
now
it
is
plain
that
in
this
conception
we
would
run
up
these
parts
to
the
greatest
minuteness
which
can
possibly
be
conceived
since
the
contact
of
large
parts
would
never
render
the
figures
equal
but
the
minutest
parts
we
can
conceive
are
mathematical
points
and
consequently
this
standard
of
equality
is
the
same
with
that
derived
from
the
equality
of
the
number
of
points
which
we
have
already
determined
to
be
a
just
but
an
useless
standard
we
must
therefore
look
to
some
other
quarter
for
a
solution
of
the
present
difficulty
there
are
many
philosophers
who
refuse
to
assign
any
standard
of
equality
but
assert
that
it
is
sufficient
to
present
two
objects
that
are
equal
in
order
to
give
us
a
just
notion
of
this
proportion
all
definitions
say
they
are
fruitless
without
the
perception
of
such
objects
and
where
we
perceive
such
objects
we
no
longer
stand
in
need
of
any
definition
to
this
reasoning
i
entirely
agree
and
assert
that
the
only
useful
notion
of
equality
or
inequality
is
derived
from
the
whole
united
appearance
and
the
comparison
of
particular
objects
it
is
evident
that
the
eye
or
rather
the
mind
is
often
able
at
one
view
to
determine
the
proportions
of
bodies
and
pronounce
them
equal
to
or
greater
or
less
than
each
other
without
examining
or
comparing
the
number
of
their
minute
parts
such
judgments
are
not
only
common
but
in
many
cases
certain
and
infallible
when
the
measure
of
a
yard
and
that
of
a
foot
are
presented
the
mind
can
no
more
question
that
the
first
is
longer
than
the
second
than
it
can
doubt
of
those
principles
which
are
the
most
clear
and
there
are
therefore
three
proportions
which
the
mind
distinguishes
in
the
general
appearance
of
its
objects
and
calls
by
the
names
of
greater
less
and
equal
but
though
its
decisions
concerning
these
proportions
be
sometimes
infallible
they
are
not
always
so
nor
are
our
judgments
of
this
kind
more
exempt
from
doubt
and
error
than
those
on
any
other
subject
we
frequently
correct
our
first
opinion
by
a
review
and
reflection
and
pronounce
those
objects
to
be
equal
which
at
first
we
esteemed
unequal
and
regard
an
object
as
less
though
before
it
appeared
greater
than
another
nor
is
this
the
only
correction
which
these
judgments
of
our
senses
undergo
but
we
often
discover
our
error
by
a
juxtaposition
of
the
objects
or
where
that
is
impracticable
by
the
use
of
some
common
and
invariable
measure
which
being
successively
applied
to
each
informs
us
of
their
different
proportions
and
even
this
correction
is
susceptible
of
a
new
correction
and
of
different
degrees
of
exactness
according
to
the
nature
of
the
instrument
by
which
we
measure
the
bodies
and
the
care
which
we
employ
in
the
comparison
when
therefore
the
mind
is
accustomed
to
these
judgments
and
their
corrections
and
finds
that
the
same
proportion
which
makes
two
figures
have
in
the
eye
that
appearance
which
we
call
equality
makes
them
also
correspond
to
each
other
and
to
any
common
measure
with
which
they
are
compared
we
form
a
mixed
notion
of
equality
derived
both
from
the
looser
and
stricter
methods
of
comparison
but
we
are
not
content
with
this
for
as
sound
reason
convinces
us
that
there
are
bodies
vastly
more
minute
than
those
which
appear
to
the
senses
and
as
a
false
reason
would
perswade
us
that
there
are
bodies
infinitely
more
minute
we
clearly
perceive
that
we
are
not
possessed
of
any
instrument
or
art
of
measuring
which
can
secure
us
from
ill
error
and
uncertainty
we
are
sensible
that
the
addition
or
removal
of
one
of
these
minute
parts
is
not
discernible
either
in
the
appearance
or
measuring
and
as
we
imagine
that
two
figures
which
were
equal
before
can
not
be
equal
after
this
removal
or
addition
we
therefore
suppose
some
imaginary
standard
of
equality
by
which
the
appearances
and
measuring
are
exactly
corrected
and
the
figures
reduced
entirely
to
that
proportion
this
standard
is
plainly
imaginary
for
as
the
very
idea
of
equality
is
that
of
such
a
particular
appearance
corrected
by
juxtaposition
or
a
common
measure
the
notion
of
any
correction
beyond
what
we
have
instruments
and
art
to
make
is
a
mere
fiction
of
the
mind
and
useless
as
well
as
incomprehensible
but
though
this
standard
be
only
imaginary
the
fiction
however
is
very
natural
nor
is
anything
more
usual
than
for
the
mind
to
proceed
after
this
manner
with
any
action
even
after
the
reason
has
ceased
which
first
determined
it
to
begin
this
appears
very
conspicuously
with
regard
to
time
where
though
it
is
evident
we
have
no
exact
method
of
determining
the
proportions
of
parts
not
even
so
exact
as
in
extension
yet
the
various
corrections
of
our
measures
and
their
different
degrees
of
exactness
have
given
as
an
obscure
and
implicit
notion
of
a
perfect
and
entire
equality
the
case
is
the
same
in
many
other
subjects
a
musician
finding
his
ear
becoming
every
day
more
delicate
and
correcting
himself
by
reflection
and
attention
proceeds
with
the
same
act
of
the
mind
even
when
the
subject
fails
him
and
entertains
a
notion
of
a
compleat
tierce
or
octave
without
being
able
to
tell
whence
he
derives
his
standard
a
painter
forms
the
same
fiction
with
regard
to
colours
a
mechanic
with
regard
to
motion
to
the
one
light
and
shade
to
the
other
swift
and
slow
are
imagined
to
be
capable
of
an
exact
comparison
and
equality
beyond
the
judgments
of
the
senses
we
may
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
curve
and
right
lines
nothing
is
more
apparent
to
the
senses
than
the
distinction
betwixt
a
curve
and
a
right
line
nor
are
there
any
ideas
we
more
easily
form
than
the
ideas
of
these
objects
but
however
easily
we
may
form
these
ideas
it
is
impossible
to
produce
any
definition
of
them
which
will
fix
the
precise
boundaries
betwixt
them
when
we
draw
lines
upon
paper
or
any
continued
surface
there
is
a
certain
order
by
which
the
lines
run
along
from
one
point
to
another
that
they
may
produce
the
entire
impression
of
a
curve
or
right
line
but
this
order
is
perfectly
unknown
and
nothing
is
observed
but
the
united
appearance
thus
even
upon
the
system
of
indivisible
points
we
can
only
form
a
distant
notion
of
some
unknown
standard
to
these
objects
upon
that
of
infinite
divisibility
we
can
not
go
even
this
length
but
are
reduced
meerly
to
the
general
appearance
as
the
rule
by
which
we
determine
lines
to
be
either
curve
or
right
ones
but
though
we
can
give
no
perfect
definition
of
these
lines
nor
produce
any
very
exact
method
of
distinguishing
the
one
from
the
other
yet
this
hinders
us
not
from
correcting
the
first
appearance
by
a
more
accurate
consideration
and
by
a
comparison
with
some
rule
of
whose
rectitude
from
repeated
trials
we
have
a
greater
assurance
and
it
is
from
these
corrections
and
by
carrying
on
the
same
action
of
the
mind
even
when
its
reason
fails
us
that
we
form
the
loose
idea
of
a
perfect
standard
to
these
figures
without
being
able
to
explain
or
comprehend
it
it
is
true
mathematicians
pretend
they
give
an
exact
definition
of
a
right
line
when
they
say
it
is
the
shortest
way
betwixt
two
points
but
in
the
first
place
i
observe
that
this
is
more
properly
the
discovery
of
one
of
the
properties
of
a
right
line
than
a
just
deflation
of
it
for
i
ask
any
one
if
upon
mention
of
a
right
line
he
thinks
not
immediately
on
such
a
particular
appearance
and
if
it
is
not
by
accident
only
that
he
considers
this
property
a
right
line
can
be
comprehended
alone
but
this
definition
is
unintelligible
without
a
comparison
with
other
lines
which
we
conceive
to
be
more
extended
in
common
life
it
is
established
as
a
maxim
that
the
straightest
way
is
always
the
shortest
which
would
be
as
absurd
as
to
say
the
shortest
way
is
always
the
shortest
if
our
idea
of
a
right
line
was
not
different
from
that
of
the
shortest
way
betwixt
two
points
secondly
i
repeat
what
i
have
already
established
that
we
have
no
precise
idea
of
equality
and
inequality
shorter
and
longer
more
than
of
a
right
line
or
a
curve
and
consequently
that
the
one
can
never
afford
us
a
perfect
standard
for
the
other
an
exact
idea
can
never
be
built
on
such
as
are
loose
and
undetermined
the
idea
of
a
plain
surface
is
as
little
susceptible
of
a
precise
standard
as
that
of
a
right
line
nor
have
we
any
other
means
of
distinguishing
such
a
surface
than
its
general
appearance
it
is
in
vain
that
mathematicians
represent
a
plain
surface
as
produced
by
the
flowing
of
a
right
line
it
will
immediately
be
objected
that
our
idea
of
a
surface
is
as
independent
of
this
method
of
forming
a
surface
as
our
idea
of
an
ellipse
is
of
that
of
a
cone
that
the
idea
of
a
right
line
is
no
more
precise
than
that
of
a
plain
surface
that
a
right
line
may
flow
irregularly
and
by
that
means
form
a
figure
quite
different
from
a
plane
and
that
therefore
we
must
suppose
it
to
flow
along
two
right
lines
parallel
to
each
other
and
on
the
same
plane
which
is
a
description
that
explains
a
thing
by
itself
and
returns
in
a
circle
it
appears
then
that
the
ideas
which
are
most
essential
to
geometry
viz
those
of
equality
and
inequality
of
a
right
line
and
a
plain
surface
are
far
from
being
exact
and
determinate
according
to
our
common
method
of
conceiving
them
not
only
we
are
incapable
of
telling
if
the
case
be
in
any
degree
doubtful
when
such
particular
figures
are
equal
when
such
a
line
is
a
right
one
and
such
a
surface
a
plain
one
but
we
can
form
no
idea
of
that
proportion
or
of
these
figures
which
is
firm
and
invariable
our
appeal
is
still
to
the
weak
and
fallible
judgment
which
we
make
from
the
appearance
of
the
objects
and
correct
by
a
compass
or
common
measure
and
if
we
join
the
supposition
of
any
farther
correction
it
is
of
as
is
either
useless
or
imaginary
in
vain
should
we
have
recourse
to
the
common
topic
and
employ
the
supposition
of
a
deity
whose
omnipotence
may
enable
him
to
form
a
perfect
geometrical
figure
and
describe
a
right
line
without
any
curve
or
inflexion
as
the
ultimate
standard
of
these
figures
is
derived
from
nothing
but
the
senses
and
imagination
it
is
absurd
to
talk
of
any
perfection
beyond
what
these
faculties
can
judge
of
since
the
true
perfection
of
any
thing
consists
in
its
conformity
to
its
standard
now
since
these
ideas
are
so
loose
and
uncertain
i
would
fain
ask
any
mathematician
what
infallible
assurance
he
has
not
only
of
the
more
intricate
and
obscure
propositions
of
his
science
but
of
the
most
vulgar
and
obvious
principles
how
can
he
prove
to
me
for
instance
that
two
right
lines
can
not
have
one
common
segment
or
that
it
is
impossible
to
draw
more
than
one
right
line
betwixt
any
two
points
should
he
tell
me
that
these
opinions
are
obviously
absurd
and
repugnant
to
our
clear
ideas
i
would
answer
that
i
do
not
deny
where
two
right
lines
incline
upon
each
other
with
a
sensible
angle
but
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
them
to
have
a
common
segment
but
supposing
these
two
lines
to
approach
at
the
rate
of
an
inch
in
twenty
leagues
i
perceive
no
absurdity
in
asserting
that
upon
their
contact
they
become
one
for
i
beseech
you
by
what
rule
or
standard
do
you
judge
when
you
assert
that
the
line
in
which
i
have
supposed
them
to
concur
can
not
make
the
same
right
line
with
those
two
that
form
so
small
an
angle
betwixt
them
you
must
surely
have
some
idea
of
a
right
line
to
which
this
line
does
not
agree
do
you
therefore
mean
that
it
takes
not
the
points
in
the
same
order
and
by
the
same
rule
as
is
peculiar
and
essential
to
a
right
line
if
so
i
must
inform
you
that
besides
that
in
judging
after
this
manner
you
allow
that
extension
is
composed
of
indivisible
points
which
perhaps
is
more
than
you
intend
besides
this
i
say
i
must
inform
you
that
neither
is
this
the
standard
from
which
we
form
the
idea
of
a
right
line
nor
if
it
were
is
there
any
such
firmness
in
our
senses
or
imagination
as
to
determine
when
such
an
order
is
violated
or
preserved
the
original
standard
of
a
right
line
is
in
reality
nothing
but
a
certain
general
appearance
and
it
is
evident
right
lines
may
be
made
to
concur
with
each
other
and
yet
correspond
to
this
standard
though
corrected
by
all
the
means
either
practicable
or
imaginable
to
whatever
side
mathematicians
turn
this
dilemma
still
meets
them
if
they
judge
of
equality
or
any
other
proportion
by
the
accurate
and
exact
standard
viz
the
enumeration
of
the
minute
indivisible
parts
they
both
employ
a
standard
which
is
useless
in
practice
and
actually
establish
the
indivisibility
of
extension
which
they
endeavour
to
explode
or
if
they
employ
as
is
usual
the
inaccurate
standard
derived
from
a
comparison
of
objects
upon
their
general
appearance
corrected
by
measuring
and
juxtaposition
their
first
principles
though
certain
and
infallible
are
too
coarse
to
afford
any
such
subtile
inferences
as
they
commonly
draw
from
them
the
first
principles
are
founded
on
the
imagination
and
senses
the
conclusion
therefore
can
never
go
beyond
much
less
contradict
these
faculties
this
may
open
our
eyes
a
little
and
let
us
see
that
no
geometrical
demonstration
for
the
infinite
divisibility
of
extension
can
have
so
much
force
as
what
we
naturally
attribute
to
every
argument
which
is
supported
by
such
magnificent
pretensions
at
the
same
time
we
may
learn
the
reason
why
geometry
falls
of
evidence
in
this
single
point
while
all
its
other
reasonings
command
our
fullest
assent
and
approbation
and
indeed
it
seems
more
requisite
to
give
the
reason
of
this
exception
than
to
shew
that
we
really
must
make
such
an
exception
and
regard
all
the
mathematical
arguments
for
infinite
divisibility
as
utterly
sophistical
for
it
is
evident
that
as
no
idea
of
quantity
is
infinitely
divisible
there
can
not
be
imagined
a
more
glaring
absurdity
than
to
endeavour
to
prove
that
quantity
itself
admits
of
such
a
division
and
to
prove
this
by
means
of
ideas
which
are
directly
opposite
in
that
particular
and
as
this
absurdity
is
very
glaring
in
itself
so
there
is
no
argument
founded
on
it
which
is
not
attended
with
a
new
absurdity
and
involves
not
an
evident
contradiction
i
might
give
as
instances
those
arguments
for
infinite
divisibility
which
are
derived
from
the
point
of
contact
i
know
there
is
no
mathematician
who
will
not
refuse
to
be
judged
by
the
diagrams
he
describes
upon
paper
these
being
loose
draughts
as
he
will
tell
us
and
serving
only
to
convey
with
greater
facility
certain
ideas
which
are
the
true
foundation
of
all
our
reasoning
this
i
am
satisfyed
with
and
am
willing
to
rest
the
controversy
merely
upon
these
ideas
i
desire
therefore
our
mathematician
to
form
as
accurately
as
possible
the
ideas
of
a
circle
and
a
right
line
and
i
then
ask
if
upon
the
conception
of
their
contact
he
can
conceive
them
as
touching
in
a
mathematical
point
or
if
he
must
necessarily
imagine
them
to
concur
for
some
space
whichever
side
he
chuses
he
runs
himself
into
equal
difficulties
if
he
affirms
that
in
tracing
these
figures
in
his
imagination
he
can
imagine
them
to
touch
only
in
a
point
he
allows
the
possibility
of
that
idea
and
consequently
of
the
thing
if
he
says
that
in
his
conception
of
the
contact
of
those
lines
he
must
make
them
concur
he
thereby
acknowledges
the
fallacy
of
geometrical
demonstrations
when
carryed
beyond
a
certain
degree
of
minuteness
since
it
is
certain
he
has
such
demonstrations
against
the
concurrence
of
a
circle
and
a
right
line
that
is
in
other
words
he
can
prove
an
idea
viz
that
of
concurrence
to
be
incompatible
with
two
other
ideas
those
of
a
circle
and
right
line
though
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledges
these
ideas
to
be
inseparable
sect
the
same
subject
continued
if
the
second
part
of
my
system
be
true
that
the
idea
of
space
or
extension
is
nothing
but
the
idea
of
visible
or
tangible
points
distributed
in
a
certain
order
it
follows
that
we
can
form
no
idea
of
a
vacuum
or
space
where
there
is
nothing
visible
or
tangible
this
gives
rise
to
three
objections
which
i
shall
examine
together
because
the
answer
i
shall
give
to
one
is
a
consequence
of
that
which
i
shall
make
use
of
for
the
others
first
it
may
be
said
that
men
have
disputed
for
many
ages
concerning
a
vacuum
and
a
plenum
without
being
able
to
bring
the
affair
to
a
final
decision
and
philosophers
even
at
this
day
think
themselves
at
liberty
to
take
part
on
either
side
as
their
fancy
leads
them
but
whatever
foundation
there
may
be
for
a
controversy
concerning
the
things
themselves
it
may
be
pretended
that
the
very
dispute
is
decisive
concerning
the
idea
and
that
it
is
impossible
men
coued
so
long
reason
about
a
vacuum
and
either
refute
or
defend
it
without
having
a
notion
of
what
they
refuted
or
defended
secondly
if
this
argument
should
be
contested
the
reality
or
at
least
the
possibility
of
the
idea
of
a
vacuum
may
be
proved
by
the
following
reasoning
every
idea
is
possible
which
is
a
necessary
and
infallible
consequence
of
such
as
are
possible
now
though
we
allow
the
world
to
be
at
present
a
plenum
we
may
easily
conceive
it
to
be
deprived
of
motion
and
this
idea
will
certainly
be
allowed
possible
it
must
also
be
allowed
possible
to
conceive
the
annihilation
of
any
part
of
matter
by
the
omnipotence
of
the
deity
while
the
other
parts
remain
at
rest
for
as
every
idea
that
is
distinguishable
is
separable
by
the
imagination
and
as
every
idea
that
is
separable
by
the
imagination
may
be
conceived
to
be
separately
existent
it
is
evident
that
the
existence
of
one
particle
of
matter
no
more
implies
the
existence
of
another
than
a
square
figure
in
one
body
implies
a
square
figure
in
every
one
this
being
granted
i
now
demand
what
results
from
the
concurrence
of
these
two
possible
ideas
of
rest
and
annihilation
and
what
must
we
conceive
to
follow
upon
the
annihilation
of
all
the
air
and
subtile
matter
in
the
chamber
supposing
the
walls
to
remain
the
same
without
any
motion
or
alteration
there
are
some
metaphysicians
who
answer
that
since
matter
and
extension
are
the
same
the
annihilation
of
one
necessarily
implies
that
of
the
other
and
there
being
now
no
distance
betwixt
the
walls
of
the
chamber
they
touch
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
my
hand
touches
the
paper
which
is
immediately
before
me
but
though
this
answer
be
very
common
i
defy
these
metaphysicians
to
conceive
the
matter
according
to
their
hypothesis
or
imagine
the
floor
and
roof
with
all
the
opposite
sides
of
the
chamber
to
touch
each
other
while
they
continue
in
rest
and
preserve
the
same
position
for
how
can
the
two
walls
that
run
from
south
to
north
touch
each
other
while
they
touch
the
opposite
ends
of
two
walls
that
run
from
east
to
west
and
how
can
the
floor
and
roof
ever
meet
while
they
are
separated
by
the
four
walls
that
lie
in
a
contrary
position
if
you
change
their
position
you
suppose
a
motion
if
you
conceive
any
thing
betwixt
them
you
suppose
a
new
creation
but
keeping
strictly
to
the
two
ideas
of
rest
and
annihilation
it
is
evident
that
the
idea
which
results
from
them
is
not
that
of
a
contact
of
parts
but
something
else
which
is
concluded
to
be
the
idea
of
a
vacuum
the
third
objection
carries
the
matter
still
farther
and
not
only
asserts
that
the
idea
of
a
vacuum
is
real
and
possible
but
also
necessary
and
unavoidable
this
assertion
is
founded
on
the
motion
we
observe
in
bodies
which
it
is
maintained
would
be
impossible
and
inconceivable
without
a
vacuum
into
which
one
body
must
move
in
order
to
make
way
for
i
shall
not
enlarge
upon
this
objection
because
it
principally
belongs
to
natural
philosophy
which
lies
without
our
present
sphere
in
order
to
answer
these
objections
we
must
take
the
matter
pretty
deep
and
consider
the
nature
and
origin
of
several
ideas
lest
we
dispute
without
understanding
perfectly
the
subject
of
the
controversy
it
is
evident
the
idea
of
darkness
is
no
positive
idea
but
merely
the
negation
of
light
or
more
properly
speaking
of
coloured
and
visible
objects
a
man
who
enjoys
his
sight
receives
no
other
perception
from
turning
his
eyes
on
every
side
when
entirely
deprived
of
light
than
what
is
common
to
him
with
one
born
blind
and
it
is
certain
has
no
idea
either
of
light
or
darkness
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
it
is
not
from
the
mere
removal
of
visible
objects
we
receive
the
impression
of
extension
without
matter
and
that
the
idea
of
utter
darkness
can
never
be
the
same
with
that
of
vacuum
suppose
again
a
man
to
be
supported
in
the
air
and
to
be
softly
conveyed
along
by
some
invisible
power
it
is
evident
he
is
sensible
of
nothing
and
never
receives
the
idea
of
extension
nor
indeed
any
idea
from
this
invariable
motion
even
supposing
he
moves
his
limbs
to
and
fro
this
can
not
convey
to
him
that
idea
he
feels
in
that
case
a
certain
sensation
or
impression
the
parts
of
which
are
successive
to
each
other
and
may
give
him
the
idea
of
time
but
certainly
are
not
disposed
in
such
a
manner
as
is
necessary
to
convey
the
idea
of
space
or
the
idea
of
space
or
extension
since
then
it
appears
that
darkness
and
motion
with
the
utter
removal
of
every
thing
visible
and
tangible
can
never
give
us
the
idea
of
extension
without
matter
or
of
a
vacuum
the
next
question
is
whether
they
can
convey
this
idea
when
mixed
with
something
visible
and
tangible
it
is
commonly
allowed
by
philosophers
that
all
bodies
which
discover
themselves
to
the
eye
appear
as
if
painted
on
a
plain
surface
and
that
their
different
degrees
of
remoteness
from
ourselves
are
discovered
more
by
reason
than
by
the
senses
when
i
hold
up
my
hand
before
me
and
spread
my
fingers
they
are
separated
as
perfectly
by
the
blue
colour
of
the
firmament
as
they
coued
be
by
any
visible
object
which
i
coued
place
betwixt
them
in
order
therefore
to
know
whether
the
sight
can
convey
the
impression
and
idea
of
a
vacuum
we
must
suppose
that
amidst
an
entire
darkness
there
are
luminous
bodies
presented
to
us
whose
light
discovers
only
these
bodies
themselves
without
giving
us
any
impression
of
the
surrounding
objects
we
must
form
a
parallel
supposition
concerning
the
objects
of
our
feeling
it
is
not
proper
to
suppose
a
perfect
removal
of
all
tangible
objects
we
must
allow
something
to
be
perceived
by
the
feeling
and
after
an
interval
and
motion
of
the
hand
or
other
organ
of
sensation
another
object
of
the
touch
to
be
met
with
and
upon
leaving
that
another
and
so
on
as
often
as
we
please
the
question
is
whether
these
intervals
do
not
afford
us
the
idea
of
extension
without
body
to
begin
with
the
first
case
it
is
evident
that
when
only
two
luminous
bodies
appear
to
the
eye
we
can
perceive
whether
they
be
conjoined
or
separate
whether
they
be
separated
by
a
great
or
small
distance
and
if
this
distance
varies
we
can
perceive
its
increase
or
diminution
with
the
motion
of
the
bodies
but
as
the
distance
is
not
in
this
case
any
thing
coloured
or
visible
it
may
be
thought
that
there
is
here
a
vacuum
or
pure
extension
not
only
intelligible
to
the
mind
but
obvious
to
the
very
senses
this
is
our
natural
and
most
familiar
way
of
thinking
but
which
we
shall
learn
to
correct
by
a
little
reflection
we
may
observe
that
when
two
bodies
present
themselves
where
there
was
formerly
an
entire
darkness
the
only
change
that
is
discoverable
is
in
the
appearance
of
these
two
objects
and
that
all
the
rest
continues
to
be
as
before
a
perfect
negation
of
light
and
of
every
coloured
or
visible
object
this
is
not
only
true
of
what
may
be
said
to
be
remote
from
these
bodies
but
also
of
the
very
distance
which
is
interposed
betwixt
them
that
being
nothing
but
darkness
or
the
negation
of
light
without
parts
without
composition
invariable
and
indivisible
now
since
this
distance
causes
no
perception
different
from
what
a
blind
man
receives
from
his
eyes
or
what
is
conveyed
to
us
in
the
darkest
night
it
must
partake
of
the
same
properties
and
as
blindness
and
darkness
afford
us
no
ideas
of
extension
it
is
impossible
that
the
dark
and
undistinguishable
distance
betwixt
two
bodies
can
ever
produce
that
idea
the
sole
difference
betwixt
an
absolute
darkness
and
the
appearance
of
two
or
more
visible
luminous
objects
consists
as
i
said
in
the
objects
themselves
and
in
the
manner
they
affect
our
senses
the
angles
which
the
rays
of
light
flowing
from
them
form
with
each
other
the
motion
that
is
required
in
the
eye
in
its
passage
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
different
parts
of
the
organs
which
are
affected
by
them
these
produce
the
only
perceptions
from
which
we
can
judge
of
the
distance
but
as
these
perceptions
are
each
of
them
simple
and
indivisible
they
can
never
give
us
the
idea
of
extension
we
may
illustrate
this
by
considering
the
sense
of
feeling
and
the
imaginary
distance
or
interval
interposed
betwixt
tangible
or
solid
objects
i
suppose
two
cases
viz
that
of
a
man
supported
in
the
air
and
moving
his
limbs
to
and
fro
without
meeting
any
thing
tangible
and
that
of
a
man
who
feeling
something
tangible
leaves
it
and
after
a
motion
of
which
he
is
sensible
perceives
another
tangible
object
and
i
then
ask
wherein
consists
the
difference
betwixt
these
two
cases
no
one
will
make
any
scruple
to
affirm
that
it
consists
meerly
in
the
perceiving
those
objects
and
that
the
sensation
which
arises
from
the
motion
is
in
both
cases
the
same
and
as
that
sensation
is
not
capable
of
conveying
to
us
an
idea
of
extension
when
unaccompanyed
with
some
other
perception
it
can
no
more
give
us
that
idea
when
mixed
with
the
impressions
of
tangible
objects
since
that
mixture
produces
no
alteration
upon
it
but
though
motion
and
darkness
either
alone
or
attended
with
tangible
and
visible
objects
convey
no
idea
of
a
vacuum
or
extension
without
matter
yet
they
are
the
causes
why
we
falsly
imagine
we
can
form
such
an
idea
for
there
is
a
close
relation
betwixt
that
motion
and
darkness
and
a
real
extension
or
composition
of
visible
and
tangible
objects
first
we
may
observe
that
two
visible
objects
appearing
in
the
midst
of
utter
darkness
affect
the
senses
in
the
same
manner
and
form
the
same
angle
by
the
rays
which
flow
from
them
and
meet
in
the
eye
as
if
the
distance
betwixt
them
were
find
with
visible
objects
that
give
us
a
true
idea
of
extension
the
sensation
of
motion
is
likewise
the
same
when
there
is
nothing
tangible
interposed
betwixt
two
bodies
as
when
we
feel
a
compounded
body
whose
different
parts
are
placed
beyond
each
other
secondly
we
find
by
experience
that
two
bodies
which
are
so
placed
as
to
affect
the
senses
in
the
same
manner
with
two
others
that
have
a
certain
extent
of
visible
objects
interposed
betwixt
them
are
capable
of
receiving
the
same
extent
without
any
sensible
impulse
or
penetration
and
without
any
change
on
that
angle
under
which
they
appear
to
the
senses
in
like
manner
where
there
is
one
object
which
we
can
not
feel
after
another
without
an
interval
and
the
perceiving
of
that
sensation
we
call
motion
in
our
hand
or
organ
of
sensation
experience
shews
us
that
it
is
possible
the
same
object
may
be
felt
with
the
same
sensation
of
motion
along
with
the
interposed
impression
of
solid
and
tangible
objects
attending
the
sensation
that
is
in
other
words
an
invisible
and
intangible
distance
may
be
converted
into
a
visible
and
tangible
one
without
any
change
on
the
distant
objects
thirdly
we
may
observe
as
another
relation
betwixt
these
two
kinds
of
distance
that
they
have
nearly
the
same
effects
on
every
natural
phaenomenon
for
as
all
qualities
such
as
heat
cold
light
attraction
diminish
in
proportion
to
the
distance
there
is
but
little
difference
observed
whether
this
distance
be
marled
out
by
compounded
and
sensible
objects
or
be
known
only
by
the
manner
in
which
the
distant
objects
affect
the
senses
here
then
are
three
relations
betwixt
that
distance
which
conveys
the
idea
of
extension
and
that
other
which
is
not
filled
with
any
coloured
or
solid
object
the
distant
objects
affect
the
senses
in
the
same
manner
whether
separated
by
the
one
distance
or
the
other
the
second
species
of
distance
is
found
capable
of
receiving
the
first
and
they
both
equally
diminish
the
force
of
every
quality
these
relations
betwixt
the
two
kinds
of
distance
will
afford
us
an
easy
reason
why
the
one
has
so
often
been
taken
for
the
other
and
why
we
imagine
we
have
an
idea
of
extension
without
the
idea
of
any
object
either
of
the
sight
or
feeling
for
we
may
establish
it
as
a
general
maxim
in
this
science
of
human
nature
that
wherever
there
is
a
close
relation
betwixt
two
ideas
the
mind
is
very
apt
to
mistake
them
and
in
all
its
discourses
and
reasonings
to
use
the
one
for
the
other
this
phaenomenon
occurs
on
so
many
occasions
and
is
of
such
consequence
that
i
can
not
forbear
stopping
a
moment
to
examine
its
causes
i
shall
only
premise
that
we
must
distinguish
exactly
betwixt
the
phaenomenon
itself
and
the
causes
which
i
shall
assign
for
it
and
must
not
imagine
from
any
uncertainty
in
the
latter
that
the
former
is
also
uncertain
the
phaenomenon
may
be
real
though
my
explication
be
chimerical
the
falshood
of
the
one
is
no
consequence
of
that
of
the
other
though
at
the
same
time
we
may
observe
that
it
is
very
natural
for
us
to
draw
such
a
consequence
which
is
an
evident
instance
of
that
very
principle
which
i
endeavour
to
explain
when
i
received
the
relations
of
resemblance
contiguity
and
causation
as
principles
of
union
among
ideas
without
examining
into
their
causes
it
was
more
in
prosecution
of
my
first
maxim
that
we
must
in
the
end
rest
contented
with
experience
than
for
want
of
something
specious
and
plausible
which
i
might
have
displayed
on
that
subject
it
would
have
been
easy
to
have
made
an
imaginary
dissection
of
the
brain
and
have
shewn
why
upon
our
conception
of
any
idea
the
animal
spirits
run
into
all
the
contiguous
traces
and
rouze
up
the
other
ideas
that
are
related
to
it
but
though
i
have
neglected
any
advantage
which
i
might
have
drawn
from
this
topic
in
explaining
the
relations
of
ideas
i
am
afraid
i
must
here
have
recourse
to
it
in
order
to
account
for
the
mistakes
that
arise
from
these
relations
i
shall
therefore
observe
that
as
the
mind
is
endowed
with
a
power
of
exciting
any
idea
it
pleases
whenever
it
dispatches
the
spirits
into
that
region
of
the
brain
in
which
the
idea
is
placed
these
spirits
always
excite
the
idea
when
they
run
precisely
into
the
proper
traces
and
rummage
that
cell
which
belongs
to
the
idea
but
as
their
motion
is
seldom
direct
and
naturally
turns
a
little
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
for
this
reason
the
animal
spirits
falling
into
the
contiguous
traces
present
other
related
ideas
in
lieu
of
that
which
the
mind
desired
at
first
to
survey
this
change
we
are
not
always
sensible
of
but
continuing
still
the
same
train
of
thought
make
use
of
the
related
idea
which
is
presented
to
us
and
employ
it
in
our
reasoning
as
if
it
were
the
same
with
what
we
demanded
this
is
the
cause
of
many
mistakes
and
sophisms
in
philosophy
as
will
naturally
be
imagined
and
as
it
would
be
easy
to
show
if
there
was
occasion
of
the
three
relations
that
of
resemblance
is
the
most
fertile
source
of
error
and
indeed
there
are
few
mistakes
in
reasoning
which
do
not
borrow
largely
from
that
origin
resembling
ideas
are
not
only
related
together
but
the
actions
of
the
mind
which
we
employ
in
considering
them
are
so
little
different
that
we
are
not
able
to
distinguish
them
this
last
circumstance
is
of
great
consequence
and
we
may
in
general
observe
that
wherever
the
actions
of
the
mind
in
forming
any
two
ideas
are
the
same
or
resembling
we
are
very
apt
to
confound
these
ideas
and
take
the
one
for
the
other
of
this
we
shall
see
many
instances
in
the
progress
of
this
treatise
but
though
resemblance
be
the
relation
which
most
readily
produces
a
mistake
in
ideas
yet
the
others
of
causation
and
contiguity
may
also
concur
in
the
same
influence
we
might
produce
the
figures
of
poets
and
orators
as
sufficient
proofs
of
this
were
it
as
usual
as
it
is
reasonable
in
metaphysical
subjects
to
draw
our
arguments
from
that
quarter
but
lest
metaphysicians
should
esteem
this
below
their
dignity
i
shall
borrow
a
proof
from
an
observation
which
may
be
made
on
most
of
their
own
discourses
viz
that
it
is
usual
for
men
to
use
words
for
ideas
and
to
talk
instead
of
thinking
in
their
reasonings
we
use
words
for
ideas
because
they
are
commonly
so
closely
connected
that
the
mind
easily
mistakes
them
and
this
likewise
is
the
reason
why
we
substitute
the
idea
of
a
distance
which
is
not
considered
either
as
visible
or
tangible
in
the
room
of
extension
which
is
nothing
but
a
composition
of
visible
or
tangible
points
disposed
in
a
certain
order
in
causing
this
mistake
there
concur
both
the
relations
of
causation
and
resemblance
as
the
first
species
of
distance
is
found
to
be
convertible
into
the
second
it
is
in
this
respect
a
kind
of
cause
and
the
similarity
of
their
manner
of
affecting
the
senses
and
diminishing
every
quality
forms
the
relation
of
resemblance
after
this
chain
of
reasoning
and
explication
of
my
principles
i
am
now
prepared
to
answer
all
the
objections
that
have
been
offered
whether
derived
from
metaphysics
or
mechanics
the
frequent
disputes
concerning
a
vacuum
or
extension
without
matter
prove
not
the
reality
of
the
idea
upon
which
the
dispute
turns
there
being
nothing
more
common
than
to
see
men
deceive
themselves
in
this
particular
especially
when
by
means
of
any
close
relation
there
is
another
idea
presented
which
may
be
the
occasion
of
their
mistake
we
may
make
almost
the
same
answer
to
the
second
objection
derived
from
the
conjunction
of
the
ideas
of
rest
and
annihilation
when
every
thing
is
annihilated
in
the
chamber
and
the
walls
continue
immoveable
the
chamber
must
be
conceived
much
in
the
same
manner
as
at
present
when
the
air
that
fills
it
is
not
an
object
of
the
senses
this
annihilation
leaves
to
the
eye
that
fictitious
distance
which
is
discovered
by
the
different
parts
of
the
organ
that
are
affected
and
by
the
degrees
of
light
and
shade
and
to
the
feeling
that
which
consists
in
a
sensation
of
motion
in
the
hand
or
other
member
of
the
body
in
vain
should
we
search
any
farther
on
whichever
side
we
turn
this
subject
we
shall
find
that
these
are
the
only
impressions
such
an
object
can
produce
after
the
supposed
annihilation
and
it
has
already
been
remarked
that
impressions
can
give
rise
to
no
ideas
but
to
such
as
resemble
them
since
a
body
interposed
betwixt
two
others
may
be
supposed
to
be
annihilated
without
producing
any
change
upon
such
as
lie
on
each
hand
of
it
it
is
easily
conceived
how
it
may
be
created
anew
and
yet
produce
as
little
alteration
now
the
motion
of
a
body
has
much
the
same
effect
as
its
creation
the
distant
bodies
are
no
more
affected
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
this
suffices
to
satisfy
the
imagination
and
proves
there
is
no
repugnance
in
such
a
motion
afterwards
experience
comes
in
play
to
persuade
us
that
two
bodies
situated
in
the
manner
have
really
such
a
capacity
of
receiving
body
betwixt
them
and
that
there
is
no
obstacle
to
the
conversion
of
the
invisible
and
intangible
distance
into
one
that
is
visible
and
tangible
however
natural
that
conversion
may
seem
we
can
not
be
sure
it
is
practicable
before
we
have
had
experience
of
it
thus
i
seem
to
have
answered
the
three
objections
though
at
the
same
time
i
am
sensible
that
few
will
be
satisfyed
with
these
answers
but
will
immediately
propose
new
objections
and
difficulties
it
will
probably
be
said
that
my
reasoning
makes
nothing
to
the
matter
in
hands
and
that
i
explain
only
the
manner
in
which
objects
affect
the
senses
without
endeavouring
to
account
for
their
real
nature
and
operations
though
there
be
nothing
visible
or
tangible
interposed
betwixt
two
bodies
yet
we
find
by
experience
that
the
bodies
may
be
placed
in
the
same
manner
with
regard
to
the
eye
and
require
the
same
motion
of
the
hand
in
passing
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
divided
by
something
visible
and
tangible
this
invisible
and
intangible
distance
is
also
found
by
experience
to
contain
a
capacity
of
receiving
body
or
of
becoming
visible
and
tangible
here
is
the
whole
of
my
system
and
in
no
part
of
it
have
i
endeavoured
to
explain
the
cause
which
separates
bodies
after
this
manner
and
gives
them
a
capacity
of
receiving
others
betwixt
them
without
any
impulse
or
penetration
i
answer
this
objection
by
pleading
guilty
and
by
confessing
that
my
intention
never
was
to
penetrate
into
the
nature
of
bodies
or
explain
the
secret
causes
of
their
operations
for
besides
that
this
belongs
not
to
my
present
purpose
i
am
afraid
that
such
an
enterprise
is
beyond
the
reach
of
human
understanding
and
that
we
can
never
pretend
to
know
body
otherwise
than
by
those
external
properties
which
discover
themselves
to
the
senses
as
to
those
who
attempt
any
thing
farther
i
can
not
approve
of
their
ambition
till
i
see
in
some
one
instance
at
least
that
they
have
met
with
success
but
at
present
i
content
myself
with
knowing
perfectly
the
manner
in
which
objects
affect
my
senses
and
their
connections
with
each
other
as
far
as
experience
informs
me
of
them
this
suffices
for
the
conduct
of
life
and
this
also
suffices
for
my
philosophy
which
pretends
only
to
explain
the
nature
and
causes
of
our
perceptions
or
impressions
and
ideas
footnote

as
long
as
we
confine
our
speculations
to
the
appearances
of
objects
to
our
senses
without
entering
into
disquisitions
concerning
their
real
nature
and
operations
we
are
safe
from
all
difficulties
and
can
never
be
embarrassed
by
any
question
thus
if
it
be
asked
if
the
invisible
and
intangible
distance
interposed
betwixt
two
objects
be
something
or
nothing
it
is
easy
to
answer
that
it
is
something
viz
a
property
of
the
objects
which
affect
the
senses
after
such
a
particular
manner
if
it
be
asked
whether
two
objects
having
such
a
distance
betwixt
them
touch
or
not
it
may
be
answered
that
this
depends
upon
the
definition
of
the
word
touch
if
objects
be
said
to
touch
when
there
is
nothing
sensible
interposed
betwixt
them
these
objects
touch
it
objects
be
said
to
touch
when
their
images
strike
contiguous
parts
of
the
eye
and
when
the
hand
feels
both
objects
successively
without
any
interposed
motion
these
objects
do
not
touch
the
appearances
of
objects
to
our
senses
are
all
consistent
and
no
difficulties
can
ever
arise
but
from
the
obscurity
of
the
terms
we
make
use
of
if
we
carry
our
enquiry
beyond
the
appearances
of
objects
to
the
senses
i
am
afraid
that
most
of
our
conclusions
will
be
full
of
scepticism
and
uncertainty
thus
if
it
be
asked
whether
or
not
the
invisible
and
intangible
distance
be
always
full
of
body
or
of
something
that
by
an
improvement
of
our
organs
might
become
visible
or
tangible
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
find
no
very
decisive
arguments
on
either
side
though
i
am
inclined
to
the
contrary
opinion
as
being
more
suitable
to
vulgar
and
popular
notions
if
the
newtonian
philosophy
be
rightly
understood
it
will
be
found
to
mean
no
more
a
vacuum
is
asserted
that
is
bodies
are
said
to
be
placed
after
such
a
manner
is
to
receive
bodies
betwixt
them
without
impulsion
or
penetration
the
real
nature
of
this
position
of
bodies
is
unknown
we
are
only
acquainted
with
its
effects
on
the
senses
and
its
power
of
receiving
body
nothing
is
more
suitable
to
that
philosophy
than
a
modest
scepticism
to
a
certain
degree
and
a
fair
confession
of
ignorance
in
subjects
that
exceed
all
human
capacity
i
shall
conclude
this
subject
of
extension
with
a
paradox
which
will
easily
be
explained
from
the
foregoing
reasoning
this
paradox
is
that
if
you
are
pleased
to
give
to
the
and
intangible
distance
or
in
other
words
to
the
capacity
of
becoming
a
visible
and
tangible
distance
the
name
of
a
vacuum
extension
and
matter
are
the
same
and
yet
there
is
a
vacuum
if
you
will
not
give
it
that
name
motion
is
possible
in
a
plenum
without
any
impulse
in
infinitum
without
returning
in
a
circle
and
without
penetration
but
however
we
may
express
ourselves
we
must
always
confess
that
we
have
no
idea
of
any
real
extension
without
filling
it
with
sensible
objects
and
conceiving
its
parts
as
visible
or
tangible
as
to
the
doctrine
that
time
is
nothing
but
the
manner
in
which
some
real
objects
exist
we
may
observe
that
it
is
liable
to
the
same
objections
as
the
similar
doctrine
with
regard
to
extension
if
it
be
a
sufficient
proof
that
we
have
the
idea
of
a
vacuum
because
we
dispute
and
reason
concerning
it
we
must
for
the
same
reason
have
the
idea
of
time
without
any
changeable
existence
since
there
is
no
subject
of
dispute
more
frequent
and
common
but
that
we
really
have
no
such
idea
is
certain
for
whence
should
it
be
derived
does
it
arise
from
an
impression
of
sensation
or
of
reflection
point
it
out
distinctly
to
us
that
we
may
know
its
nature
and
qualities
but
if
you
can
not
point
out
any
such
impression
you
may
be
certain
you
are
mistaken
when
you
imagine
you
have
any
such
idea
but
though
it
be
impossible
to
shew
the
impression
from
which
the
idea
of
time
without
a
changeable
existence
is
derived
yet
we
can
easily
point
out
those
appearances
which
make
us
fancy
we
have
that
idea
for
we
may
observe
that
there
is
a
continual
succession
of
perceptions
in
our
mind
so
that
the
idea
of
time
being
for
ever
present
with
us
when
we
consider
a
stedfast
object
at
and
regard
the
same
at
six
we
are
apt
to
apply
to
it
that
idea
in
the
same
manner
as
if
every
moment
were
distinguished
by
a
different
position
or
an
alteration
of
the
object
the
first
and
second
appearances
of
the
object
being
compared
with
the
succession
of
our
perceptions
seem
equally
removed
as
if
the
object
had
really
changed
to
which
we
may
add
what
experience
shews
us
that
the
object
was
susceptible
of
such
a
number
of
changes
betwixt
these
appearances
as
also
that
the
unchangeable
or
rather
fictitious
duration
has
the
same
effect
upon
every
quality
by
encreasing
or
diminishing
it
as
that
succession
which
is
obvious
to
the
senses
from
these
three
relations
we
are
apt
to
confound
our
ideas
and
imagine
we
can
form
the
idea
of
a
time
and
duration
without
any
change
or
succession
sect
vi
of
the
idea
of
existence
and
of
external
existence
it
may
not
be
amiss
before
we
leave
this
subject
to
explain
the
ideas
of
existence
and
of
external
existence
which
have
their
difficulties
as
well
as
the
ideas
of
space
and
time
by
this
means
we
shall
be
the
better
prepared
for
the
examination
of
knowledge
and
probability
when
we
understand
perfectly
all
those
particular
ideas
which
may
enter
into
our
reasoning
there
is
no
impression
nor
idea
of
any
kind
of
which
we
have
any
consciousness
or
memory
that
is
not
conceived
as
existent
and
it
is
evident
that
from
this
consciousness
the
most
perfect
idea
and
assurance
of
being
is
derived
from
hence
we
may
form
a
dilemma
the
most
clear
and
conclusive
that
can
be
imagined
viz
that
since
we
never
remember
any
idea
or
impression
without
attributing
existence
to
it
the
idea
of
existence
must
either
be
derived
from
a
distinct
impression
conjoined
with
every
perception
or
object
of
our
thought
or
must
be
the
very
same
with
the
idea
of
the
perception
or
object
as
this
dilemma
is
an
evident
consequence
of
the
principle
that
every
idea
arises
from
a
similar
impression
so
our
decision
betwixt
the
propositions
of
the
dilemma
is
no
more
doubtful
so
far
from
there
being
any
distinct
impression
attending
every
impression
and
every
idea
that
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
two
distinct
impressions
which
are
inseparably
conjoined
though
certain
sensations
may
at
one
time
be
united
we
quickly
find
they
admit
of
a
separation
and
may
be
presented
apart
and
thus
though
every
impression
and
idea
we
remember
be
considered
as
existent
the
idea
of
existence
is
not
derived
from
any
particular
impression
the
idea
of
existence
then
is
the
very
same
with
the
idea
of
what
we
conceive
to
be
existent
to
reflect
on
any
thing
simply
and
to
reflect
on
it
as
existent
are
nothing
different
from
each
other
that
idea
when
conjoined
with
the
idea
of
any
object
makes
no
addition
to
it
whatever
we
conceive
we
conceive
to
be
existent
any
idea
we
please
to
form
is
the
idea
of
a
being
and
the
idea
of
a
being
is
any
idea
we
please
to
form
whoever
opposes
this
must
necessarily
point
out
that
distinct
impression
from
which
the
idea
of
entity
is
derived
and
must
prove
that
this
impression
is
inseparable
from
every
perception
we
believe
to
be
existent
this
we
may
without
hesitation
conclude
to
be
impossible
our
foregoing
reasoning
part
sect
concerning
the
distinction
of
ideas
without
any
real
difference
will
not
here
serve
us
in
any
stead
that
kind
of
distinction
is
founded
on
the
different
resemblances
which
the
same
simple
idea
may
have
to
several
different
ideas
but
no
object
can
be
presented
resembling
some
object
with
respect
to
its
existence
and
different
from
others
in
the
same
particular
since
every
object
that
is
presented
must
necessarily
be
existent
a
like
reasoning
will
account
for
the
idea
of
external
existence
we
may
observe
that
it
is
universally
allowed
by
philosophers
and
is
besides
pretty
obvious
of
itself
that
nothing
is
ever
really
present
with
the
mind
but
its
perceptions
or
impressions
and
ideas
and
that
external
objects
become
known
to
us
only
by
those
perceptions
they
occasion
to
hate
to
love
to
think
to
feel
to
see
all
this
is
nothing
but
to
perceive
now
since
nothing
is
ever
present
to
the
mind
but
perceptions
and
since
all
ideas
are
derived
from
something
antecedently
present
to
the
mind
it
follows
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
so
much
as
to
conceive
or
form
an
idea
of
any
thing
specifically
different
from
ideas
and
impressions
let
us
fix
our
attention
out
of
ourselves
as
much
as
possible
let
us
chase
our
imagination
to
the
heavens
or
to
the
utmost
limits
of
the
universe
we
never
really
advance
a
step
beyond
ourselves
nor
can
conceive
any
kind
of
existence
but
those
perceptions
which
have
appeared
in
that
narrow
compass
this
is
the
universe
of
the
imagination
nor
have
we
any
idea
but
what
is
there
produced
the
farthest
we
can
go
towards
a
conception
of
external
objects
when
supposed
specifically
different
from
our
perceptions
is
to
form
a
relative
idea
of
them
without
pretending
to
comprehend
the
related
objects
generally
speaking
we
do
not
suppose
them
specifically
different
but
only
attribute
to
them
different
relations
connections
and
durations
but
of
this
more
fully
hereafter
part
iv
sect
part
iii
of
knowledge
and
probability
sect
i
of
knowledge
there
are
seven
part
sect
different
kinds
of
philosophical
relation
viz
resemblance
identity
relations
of
time
and
place
proportion
in
quantity
or
number
degrees
in
any
quality
contrariety
and
causation
these
relations
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
into
such
as
depend
entirely
on
the
ideas
which
we
compare
together
and
such
as
may
be
changed
without
any
change
in
the
ideas
it
is
from
the
idea
of
a
triangle
that
we
discover
the
relation
of
equality
which
its
three
angles
bear
to
two
right
ones
and
this
relation
is
invariable
as
long
as
our
idea
remains
the
same
on
the
contrary
the
relations
of
contiguity
and
distance
betwixt
two
objects
may
be
changed
merely
by
an
alteration
of
their
place
without
any
change
on
the
objects
themselves
or
on
their
ideas
and
the
place
depends
on
a
hundred
different
accidents
which
can
not
be
foreseen
by
the
mind
it
is
the
same
case
with
identity
and
causation
two
objects
though
perfectly
resembling
each
other
and
even
appearing
in
the
same
place
at
different
times
may
be
numerically
different
and
as
the
power
by
which
one
object
produces
another
is
never
discoverable
merely
from
their
idea
it
is
evident
cause
and
effect
are
relations
of
which
we
receive
information
from
experience
and
not
from
any
abstract
reasoning
or
reflection
there
is
no
single
phaenomenon
even
the
most
simple
which
can
be
accounted
for
from
the
qualities
of
the
objects
as
they
appear
to
us
or
which
we
coued
foresee
without
the
help
of
our
memory
and
experience
it
appears
therefore
that
of
these
seven
philosophical
relations
there
remain
only
four
which
depending
solely
upon
ideas
can
be
the
objects
of
knowledge
and
certainty
these
four
are
resemblance
contrariety
degrees
in
quality
and
proportions
in
quantity
or
number
three
of
these
relations
are
discoverable
at
first
sight
and
fall
more
properly
under
the
province
of
intuition
than
demonstration
when
any
objects
resemble
each
other
the
resemblance
will
at
first
strike
the
eye
or
rather
the
mind
and
seldom
requires
a
second
examination
the
case
is
the
same
with
contrariety
and
with
the
degrees
of
any
quality
no
one
can
once
doubt
but
existence
and
destroy
each
other
and
are
perfectly
incompatible
and
contrary
and
though
it
be
impossible
to
judge
exactly
of
the
degrees
of
any
quality
such
as
colour
taste
heat
cold
when
the
difference
betwixt
them
is
very
small
yet
it
is
easy
to
decide
that
any
of
them
is
superior
or
inferior
to
another
when
their
difference
is
considerable
and
this
decision
we
always
pronounce
at
first
sight
without
any
enquiry
or
reasoning
we
might
proceed
after
the
same
manner
in
fixing
the
proportions
of
quantity
or
number
and
might
at
one
view
observe
a
superiority
or
inferiority
betwixt
any
numbers
or
figures
especially
where
the
difference
is
very
great
and
remarkable
as
to
equality
or
any
exact
proportion
we
can
only
guess
at
it
from
a
single
consideration
except
in
very
short
numbers
or
very
limited
portions
of
extension
which
are
comprehended
in
an
instant
and
where
we
perceive
an
impossibility
of
falling
into
any
considerable
error
in
all
other
cases
we
must
settle
the
proportions
with
some
liberty
or
proceed
in
a
more
artificial
manner
i
have
already
observed
that
geometry
or
the
art
by
which
we
fix
the
proportions
of
figures
though
it
much
excels
both
in
universality
and
exactness
the
loose
judgments
of
the
senses
and
imagination
yet
never
attains
a
perfect
precision
and
exactness
it
first
principles
are
still
drawn
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
objects
and
that
appearance
can
never
afford
us
any
security
when
we
examine
the
prodigious
minuteness
of
which
nature
is
susceptible
our
ideas
seem
to
give
a
perfect
assurance
that
no
two
right
lines
can
have
a
common
segment
but
if
we
consider
these
ideas
we
shall
find
that
they
always
suppose
a
sensible
inclination
of
the
two
lines
and
that
where
the
angle
they
form
is
extremely
small
we
have
no
standard
of
a
i
right
line
so
precise
as
to
assure
us
of
the
truth
of
this
proposition
it
is
the
same
case
with
most
of
the
primary
decisions
of
the
mathematics
there
remain
therefore
algebra
and
arithmetic
as
the
only
sciences
in
which
we
can
carry
on
a
chain
of
reasoning
to
any
degree
of
intricacy
and
yet
preserve
a
perfect
exactness
and
certainty
we
are
possest
of
a
precise
standard
by
which
we
can
judge
of
the
equality
and
proportion
of
numbers
and
according
as
they
correspond
or
not
to
that
standard
we
determine
their
relations
without
any
possibility
of
error
when
two
numbers
are
so
combined
as
that
the
one
has
always
an
unite
answering
to
every
unite
of
the
other
we
pronounce
them
equal
and
it
is
for
want
of
such
a
standard
of
equality
in
extension
that
geometry
can
scarce
be
esteemed
a
perfect
and
infallible
science
but
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
obviate
a
difficulty
which
may
arise
from
my
asserting
that
though
geometry
falls
short
of
that
perfect
precision
and
certainty
which
are
peculiar
to
arithmetic
and
algebra
yet
it
excels
the
imperfect
judgments
of
our
senses
and
imagination
the
reason
why
i
impute
any
defect
to
geometry
is
because
its
original
and
fundamental
principles
are
derived
merely
from
appearances
and
it
may
perhaps
be
imagined
that
this
defect
must
always
attend
it
and
keep
it
from
ever
reaching
a
greater
exactness
in
the
comparison
of
objects
or
ideas
than
what
our
eye
or
imagination
alone
is
able
to
attain
i
own
that
this
defect
so
far
attends
it
as
to
keep
it
from
ever
aspiring
to
a
full
certainty
but
since
these
fundamental
principles
depend
on
the
easiest
and
least
deceitful
appearances
they
bestow
on
their
consequences
a
degree
of
exactness
of
which
these
consequences
are
singly
incapable
it
is
impossible
for
the
eye
to
determine
the
angles
of
a
chiliagon
to
be
equal
to
right
angles
or
make
any
conjecture
that
approaches
this
proportion
but
when
it
determines
that
right
lines
can
not
concur
that
we
can
not
draw
more
than
one
right
line
between
two
given
points
it
mistakes
can
never
be
of
any
consequence
and
this
is
the
nature
and
use
of
geometry
to
run
us
up
to
such
appearances
as
by
reason
of
their
simplicity
can
not
lead
us
into
any
considerable
error
i
shall
here
take
occasion
to
propose
a
second
observation
concerning
our
demonstrative
reasonings
which
is
suggested
by
the
same
subject
of
the
mathematics
it
is
usual
with
mathematicians
to
pretend
that
those
ideas
which
are
their
objects
are
of
so
refined
and
spiritual
a
nature
that
they
fall
not
under
the
conception
of
the
fancy
but
must
be
comprehended
by
a
pure
and
intellectual
view
of
which
the
superior
faculties
of
the
soul
are
alone
capable
the
same
notion
runs
through
most
parts
of
philosophy
and
is
principally
made
use
of
to
explain
oar
abstract
ideas
and
to
shew
how
we
can
form
an
idea
of
a
triangle
for
instance
which
shall
neither
be
an
isoceles
nor
scalenum
nor
be
confined
to
any
particular
length
and
proportion
of
sides
it
is
easy
to
see
why
philosophers
are
so
fond
of
this
notion
of
some
spiritual
and
refined
perceptions
since
by
that
means
they
cover
many
of
their
absurdities
and
may
refuse
to
submit
to
the
decisions
of
clear
ideas
by
appealing
to
such
as
are
obscure
and
uncertain
but
to
destroy
this
artifice
we
need
but
reflect
on
that
principle
so
oft
insisted
on
that
all
our
ideas
are
copyed
from
our
impressions
for
from
thence
we
may
immediately
conclude
that
since
all
impressions
are
clear
and
precise
the
ideas
which
are
copyed
from
them
must
be
of
the
same
nature
and
can
never
but
from
our
fault
contain
any
thing
so
dark
and
intricate
an
idea
is
by
its
very
nature
weaker
and
fainter
than
an
impression
but
being
in
every
other
respect
the
same
can
not
imply
any
very
great
mystery
if
its
weakness
render
it
obscure
it
is
our
business
to
remedy
that
defect
as
much
as
possible
by
keeping
the
idea
steady
and
precise
and
till
we
have
done
so
it
is
in
vain
to
pretend
to
reasoning
and
philosophy
sect
ii
of
probability
and
of
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
this
is
all
i
think
necessary
to
observe
concerning
those
four
relations
which
are
the
foundation
of
science
but
as
to
the
other
three
which
depend
not
upon
the
idea
and
may
be
absent
or
present
even
while
that
remains
the
same
it
will
be
proper
to
explain
them
more
particularly
these
three
relations
are
identity
the
situations
in
time
and
place
and
causation
all
kinds
of
reasoning
consist
in
nothing
but
a
comparison
and
a
discovery
of
those
relations
either
constant
or
inconstant
which
two
or
more
objects
bear
to
each
other
this
comparison
we
may
make
either
when
both
the
objects
are
present
to
the
senses
or
when
neither
of
them
is
present
or
when
only
one
when
both
the
objects
are
present
to
the
senses
along
with
the
relation
we
call
this
perception
rather
than
reasoning
nor
is
there
in
this
case
any
exercise
of
the
thought
or
any
action
properly
speaking
but
a
mere
passive
admission
of
the
impressions
through
the
organs
of
sensation
according
to
this
way
of
thinking
we
ought
not
to
receive
as
reasoning
any
of
the
observations
we
may
make
concerning
identity
and
the
relations
of
time
and
place
since
in
none
of
them
the
mind
can
go
beyond
what
is
immediately
present
to
the
senses
either
to
discover
the
real
existence
or
the
relations
of
objects
it
is
only
causation
which
produces
such
a
connexion
as
to
give
us
assurance
from
the
existence
or
action
of
one
object
that
it
was
followed
or
preceded
by
any
other
existence
or
action
nor
can
the
other
two
relations
be
ever
made
use
of
in
reasoning
except
so
far
as
they
either
affect
or
are
affected
by
it
there
is
nothing
in
any
objects
to
perswade
us
that
they
are
either
always
remote
or
always
contiguous
and
when
from
experience
and
observation
we
discover
that
their
relation
in
this
particular
is
invariable
we
always
conclude
there
is
some
secret
cause
which
separates
or
unites
them
the
same
reasoning
extends
to
identity
we
readily
suppose
an
object
may
continue
individually
the
same
though
several
times
absent
from
and
present
to
the
senses
and
ascribe
to
it
an
identity
notwithstanding
the
interruption
of
the
perception
whenever
we
conclude
that
if
we
had
kept
our
eye
or
hand
constantly
upon
it
it
would
have
conveyed
an
invariable
and
uninterrupted
perception
but
this
conclusion
beyond
the
impressions
of
our
senses
can
be
founded
only
on
the
connexion
of
cause
and
effect
nor
can
we
otherwise
have
any
security
that
the
object
is
not
changed
upon
us
however
much
the
new
object
may
resemble
that
which
was
formerly
present
to
the
senses
whenever
we
discover
such
a
perfect
resemblance
we
consider
whether
it
be
common
in
that
species
of
objects
whether
possibly
or
probably
any
cause
coued
operate
in
producing
the
change
and
resemblance
and
according
as
we
determine
concerning
these
causes
and
effects
we
form
our
judgment
concerning
the
identity
of
the
object
here
then
it
appears
that
of
those
three
relations
which
depend
not
upon
the
mere
ideas
the
only
one
that
can
be
traced
beyond
our
senses
and
informs
us
of
existences
and
objects
which
we
do
not
see
or
feel
is
causation
this
relation
therefore
we
shall
endeavour
to
explain
fully
before
we
leave
the
subject
of
the
understanding
to
begin
regularly
we
must
consider
the
idea
of
causation
and
see
from
what
origin
it
is
derived
it
is
impossible
to
reason
justly
without
understanding
perfectly
the
idea
concerning
which
we
reason
and
it
is
impossible
perfectly
to
understand
any
idea
without
tracing
it
up
to
its
origin
and
examining
that
primary
impression
from
which
it
arises
the
examination
of
the
impression
bestows
a
clearness
on
the
idea
and
the
examination
of
the
idea
bestows
a
like
clearness
on
all
our
reasoning
let
us
therefore
cast
our
eye
on
any
two
objects
which
we
call
cause
and
effect
and
turn
them
on
all
sides
in
order
to
find
that
impression
which
produces
an
idea
of
such
prodigious
consequence
at
first
sight
i
perceive
that
i
must
not
search
for
it
in
any
of
the
particular
qualities
of
the
objects
since
of
these
qualities
i
pitch
on
i
find
some
object
that
is
not
possessed
of
it
and
yet
falls
under
the
denomination
of
cause
or
effect
and
indeed
there
is
nothing
existent
either
externally
or
internally
which
is
not
to
be
considered
either
as
a
cause
or
an
effect
though
it
is
plain
there
is
no
one
quality
which
universally
belongs
to
all
beings
and
gives
them
a
title
to
that
denomination
the
idea
then
of
causation
must
be
derived
from
some
relation
among
objects
and
that
relation
we
must
now
endeavour
to
discover
i
find
in
the
first
place
that
whatever
objects
are
considered
as
causes
or
effects
are
contiguous
and
that
nothing
can
operate
in
a
time
or
place
which
is
ever
so
little
removed
from
those
of
its
existence
though
distant
objects
may
sometimes
seem
productive
of
each
other
they
are
commonly
found
upon
examination
to
be
linked
by
a
chain
of
causes
which
are
contiguous
among
themselves
and
to
the
distant
objects
and
when
in
any
particular
instance
we
can
not
discover
this
connexion
we
still
presume
it
to
exist
we
may
therefore
consider
the
relation
of
contiguity
as
essential
to
that
of
causation
at
least
may
suppose
it
such
according
to
the
general
opinion
till
we
can
find
a
more
part
iv
sect
proper
occasion
to
clear
up
this
matter
by
examining
what
objects
are
or
are
not
susceptible
of
juxtaposition
and
conjunction
the
second
relation
i
shall
observe
as
essential
to
causes
and
effects
is
not
so
universally
acknowledged
but
is
liable
to
some
controversy
it
is
that
of
priority
of
time
in
the
cause
before
the
effect
some
pretend
that
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
a
cause
should
precede
its
effect
but
that
any
object
or
action
in
the
very
first
moment
of
its
existence
may
exert
its
productive
quality
and
give
rise
to
another
object
or
action
perfectly
with
itself
but
beside
that
experience
in
most
instances
seems
to
contradict
this
opinion
we
may
establish
the
relation
of
priority
by
a
kind
of
inference
or
reasoning
it
is
an
established
maxim
both
in
natural
and
moral
philosophy
that
an
object
which
exists
for
any
time
in
its
full
perfection
without
producing
another
is
not
its
sole
cause
but
is
assisted
by
some
other
principle
which
pushes
it
from
its
state
of
inactivity
and
makes
it
exert
that
energy
of
which
it
was
secretly
possest
now
if
any
cause
may
be
perfectly
with
its
effect
it
is
certain
according
to
this
maxim
that
they
must
all
of
them
be
so
since
any
one
of
them
which
retards
its
operation
for
a
single
moment
exerts
not
itself
at
that
very
individual
time
in
which
it
might
have
operated
and
therefore
is
no
proper
cause
the
consequence
of
this
would
be
no
less
than
the
destruction
of
that
succession
of
causes
which
we
observe
in
the
world
and
indeed
the
utter
annihilation
of
time
for
if
one
cause
were
with
its
effect
and
this
effect
with
its
effect
and
so
on
it
is
plain
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
succession
and
all
objects
must
be
if
this
argument
appear
satisfactory
it
is
well
if
not
i
beg
the
reader
to
allow
me
the
same
liberty
which
i
have
used
in
the
preceding
case
of
supposing
it
such
for
he
shall
find
that
the
affair
is
of
no
great
importance
having
thus
discovered
or
supposed
the
two
relations
of
contiguity
and
succession
to
be
essential
to
causes
and
effects
i
find
i
am
stopt
short
and
can
proceed
no
farther
in
considering
any
single
instance
of
cause
and
effect
motion
in
one
body
is
regarded
upon
impulse
as
the
cause
of
motion
in
another
when
we
consider
these
objects
with
utmost
attention
we
find
only
that
the
one
body
approaches
the
other
and
that
the
motion
of
it
precedes
that
of
the
other
but
without
any
sensible
interval
it
is
in
vain
to
rack
ourselves
with
farther
thought
and
reflection
upon
this
subject
we
can
go
no
farther
in
considering
this
particular
instance
should
any
one
leave
this
instance
and
pretend
to
define
a
cause
by
saying
it
is
something
productive
of
another
it
is
evident
he
would
say
nothing
for
what
does
he
mean
by
production
can
he
give
any
definition
of
it
that
will
not
be
the
same
with
that
of
causation
if
he
can
i
desire
it
may
be
produced
if
he
can
not
he
here
runs
in
a
circle
and
gives
a
synonimous
term
instead
of
a
definition
shall
we
then
rest
contented
with
these
two
relations
of
contiguity
and
succession
as
affording
a
complete
idea
of
causation
by
no
means
an
object
may
be
contiguous
and
prior
to
another
without
being
considered
as
its
cause
there
is
a
necessary
connexion
to
be
taken
into
consideration
and
that
relation
is
of
much
greater
importance
than
any
of
the
other
two
here
again
i
turn
the
object
on
all
sides
in
order
to
discover
the
nature
of
this
necessary
connexion
and
find
the
impression
or
impressions
from
which
its
idea
may
be
derived
when
i
cast
my
eye
on
the
known
qualities
of
objects
i
immediately
discover
that
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
depends
not
in
the
least
on
them
when
i
consider
their
relations
i
can
find
none
but
those
of
contiguity
and
succession
which
i
have
already
regarded
as
imperfect
and
unsatisfactory
shall
the
despair
of
success
make
me
assert
that
i
am
here
possest
of
an
idea
which
is
not
preceded
by
any
similar
impression
this
would
be
too
strong
a
proof
of
levity
and
inconstancy
since
the
contrary
principle
has
been
already
so
firmly
established
as
to
admit
of
no
farther
doubt
at
least
till
we
have
more
fully
examined
the
present
difficulty
we
must
therefore
proceed
like
those
who
being
in
search
of
any
thing
that
lies
concealed
from
them
and
not
finding
it
in
the
place
they
expected
beat
about
all
the
neighbouring
fields
without
any
certain
view
or
design
in
hopes
their
good
fortune
will
at
last
guide
them
to
what
they
search
for
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
leave
the
direct
survey
of
this
question
concerning
the
nature
of
that
necessary
connexion
which
enters
into
our
idea
of
cause
and
effect
and
endeavour
to
find
some
other
questions
the
examination
of
which
will
perhaps
afford
a
hint
that
may
serve
to
clear
up
the
present
difficulty
of
these
questions
there
occur
two
which
i
shall
proceed
to
examine
viz
first
for
what
reason
we
pronounce
it
necessary
that
every
thing
whose
existence
has
a
beginning
should
also
have
a
cause
secondly
why
we
conclude
that
such
particular
causes
must
necessarily
have
such
particular
effects
and
what
is
the
nature
of
that
inference
we
draw
from
the
one
to
the
other
and
of
the
belief
we
repose
in
it
i
shall
only
observe
before
i
proceed
any
farther
that
though
the
ideas
of
cause
and
effect
be
derived
from
the
impressions
of
reflection
as
well
as
from
those
of
sensation
yet
for
brevity
sake
i
commonly
mention
only
the
latter
as
the
origin
of
these
ideas
though
i
desire
that
whatever
i
say
of
them
may
also
extend
to
the
former
passions
are
connected
with
their
objects
and
with
one
another
no
less
than
external
bodies
are
connected
together
the
same
relation
then
of
cause
and
effect
which
belongs
to
one
must
be
common
to
all
of
them
sect
iii
why
a
cause
is
always
necessary
to
begin
with
the
first
question
concerning
the
necessity
of
a
cause
it
is
a
general
maxim
in
philosophy
that
whatever
begins
to
exist
must
have
a
cause
of
existence
this
is
commonly
taken
for
granted
in
all
reasonings
without
any
proof
given
or
demanded
it
is
supposed
to
be
founded
on
intuition
and
to
be
one
of
those
maxims
which
though
they
may
be
denyed
with
the
lips
it
is
impossible
for
men
in
their
hearts
really
to
doubt
of
but
if
we
examine
this
maxim
by
the
idea
of
knowledge
we
shall
discover
in
it
no
mark
of
any
such
intuitive
certainty
but
on
the
contrary
shall
find
that
it
is
of
a
nature
quite
foreign
to
that
species
of
conviction
all
certainty
arises
from
the
comparison
of
ideas
and
from
the
discovery
of
such
relations
as
are
unalterable
so
long
as
the
ideas
continue
the
same
these
relations
are
resemblance
proportions
in
quantity
and
number
degrees
of
any
quality
and
contrariety
none
of
which
are
implyed
in
this
proposition
whatever
has
a
beginning
has
also
a
cause
of
existence
that
proposition
therefore
is
not
intuitively
certain
at
least
any
one
who
would
assert
it
to
be
intuitively
certain
must
deny
these
to
be
the
only
infallible
relations
and
must
find
some
other
relation
of
that
kind
to
be
implyed
in
it
which
it
will
then
be
time
enough
to
examine
but
here
is
an
argument
which
proves
at
once
that
the
foregoing
proposition
is
neither
intuitively
nor
demonstrably
certain
we
can
never
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
a
cause
to
every
new
existence
or
new
modification
of
existence
without
shewing
at
the
same
time
the
impossibility
there
is
that
any
thing
can
ever
begin
to
exist
without
some
productive
principle
and
where
the
latter
proposition
can
not
be
proved
we
must
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
prove
the
former
now
that
the
latter
proposition
is
utterly
incapable
of
a
demonstrative
proof
we
may
satisfy
ourselves
by
considering
that
as
all
distinct
ideas
are
separable
from
each
other
and
as
the
ideas
of
cause
and
effect
are
evidently
distinct
it
will
be
easy
for
us
to
conceive
any
object
to
be
this
moment
and
existent
the
next
without
conjoining
to
it
the
distinct
idea
of
a
cause
or
productive
principle
the
separation
therefore
of
the
idea
of
a
cause
from
that
of
a
beginning
of
existence
is
plainly
possible
for
the
imagination
and
consequently
the
actual
separation
of
these
objects
is
so
far
possible
that
it
implies
no
contradiction
nor
absurdity
and
is
therefore
incapable
of
being
refuted
by
any
reasoning
from
mere
ideas
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
a
cause
accordingly
we
shall
find
upon
examination
that
every
demonstration
which
has
been
produced
for
the
necessity
of
a
cause
is
fallacious
and
sophistical
all
the
points
of
time
and
place
say
some
philosophers
mr
hobbes
in
which
we
can
suppose
any
object
to
begin
to
exist
are
in
themselves
equal
and
unless
there
be
some
cause
which
is
peculiar
to
one
time
and
to
one
place
and
which
by
that
means
determines
and
fixes
the
existence
it
must
remain
in
eternal
suspence
and
the
object
can
never
begin
to
be
for
want
of
something
to
fix
its
beginning
but
i
ask
is
there
any
more
difficulty
in
supposing
the
time
and
place
to
be
fixed
without
a
cause
than
to
suppose
the
existence
to
be
determined
in
that
manner
the
first
question
that
occurs
on
this
subject
is
always
whether
the
object
shall
exist
or
not
the
next
when
and
where
it
shall
begin
to
exist
if
the
removal
of
a
cause
be
intuitively
absurd
in
the
one
case
it
must
be
so
in
the
other
and
if
that
absurdity
be
not
clear
without
a
proof
in
the
one
case
it
will
equally
require
one
in
the
other
the
absurdity
then
of
the
one
supposition
can
never
be
a
proof
of
that
of
the
other
since
they
are
both
upon
the
same
footing
and
must
stand
or
fall
by
the
same
reasoning
the
second
argument
clarke
and
others
which
i
find
used
on
this
head
labours
under
an
equal
difficulty
every
thing
it
is
said
must
have
a
cause
for
if
any
thing
wanted
a
cause
it
would
produce
itself
that
is
exist
before
it
existed
which
is
impossible
but
this
reasoning
is
plainly
unconclusive
because
it
supposes
that
in
our
denial
of
a
cause
we
still
grant
what
we
expressly
deny
viz
that
there
must
be
a
cause
which
therefore
is
taken
to
be
the
object
itself
and
that
no
doubt
is
an
evident
contradiction
but
to
say
that
any
thing
is
produced
or
to
express
myself
more
properly
comes
into
existence
without
a
cause
is
not
to
affirm
that
it
is
itself
its
own
cause
but
on
the
contrary
in
excluding
all
external
causes
excludes
a
fortiori
the
thing
itself
which
is
created
an
object
that
exists
absolutely
without
any
cause
certainly
is
not
its
own
cause
and
when
you
assert
that
the
one
follows
from
the
other
you
suppose
the
very
point
in
questions
and
take
it
for
granted
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
any
thing
can
ever
begin
to
exist
without
a
cause
but
that
upon
the
exclusion
of
one
productive
principle
we
must
still
have
recourse
to
another
it
is
exactly
the
same
case
with
the
third
argument
mr
locke
which
has
been
employed
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
a
cause
whatever
is
produced
without
any
cause
is
produced
by
nothing
or
in
other
words
has
nothing
for
its
cause
but
nothing
can
never
be
a
cause
no
more
than
it
can
be
something
or
equal
to
two
right
angles
by
the
same
intuition
that
we
perceive
nothing
not
to
be
equal
to
two
right
angles
or
not
to
be
something
we
perceive
that
it
can
never
be
a
cause
and
consequently
must
perceive
that
every
object
has
a
real
cause
of
its
existence
i
believe
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
employ
many
words
in
shewing
the
weakness
of
this
argument
after
what
i
have
said
of
the
foregoing
they
are
all
of
them
founded
on
the
same
fallacy
and
are
derived
from
the
same
turn
of
thought
it
is
sufficient
only
to
observe
that
when
we
exclude
all
causes
we
really
do
exclude
them
and
neither
suppose
nothing
nor
the
object
itself
to
be
the
causes
of
the
existence
and
consequently
can
draw
no
argument
from
the
absurdity
of
these
suppositions
to
prove
the
absurdity
of
that
exclusion
if
every
thing
must
have
a
cause
it
follows
that
upon
the
exclusion
of
other
causes
we
must
accept
of
the
object
itself
or
of
nothing
as
causes
but
it
is
the
very
point
in
question
whether
every
thing
must
have
a
cause
or
not
and
therefore
according
to
all
just
reasoning
it
ought
never
to
be
taken
for
granted
they
are
still
more
frivolous
who
say
that
every
effect
must
have
a
cause
because
it
is
implyed
in
the
very
idea
of
effect
every
effect
necessarily
a
cause
effect
being
a
relative
term
of
which
cause
is
the
correlative
but
this
does
not
prove
that
every
being
must
be
preceded
by
a
cause
no
more
than
it
follows
because
every
husband
must
have
a
wife
that
therefore
every
man
must
be
marryed
the
true
state
of
the
question
is
whether
every
object
which
begins
to
exist
must
owe
its
existence
to
a
cause
and
this
i
assert
neither
to
be
intuitively
nor
demonstratively
certain
and
hope
to
have
proved
it
sufficiently
by
the
foregoing
arguments
since
it
is
not
from
knowledge
or
any
scientific
reasoning
that
we
derive
the
opinion
of
the
necessity
of
a
cause
to
every
new
production
that
opinion
must
necessarily
arise
from
observation
and
experience
the
next
question
then
should
naturally
be
how
experience
gives
rise
to
such
a
principle
but
as
i
find
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
sink
this
question
in
the
following
why
we
conclude
that
such
particular
causes
must
necessarily
have
such
particular
erects
and
why
we
form
an
inference
from
one
to
another
we
shall
make
that
the
subject
of
our
future
enquiry
it
will
perhaps
be
found
in
the
end
that
the
same
answer
will
serve
for
both
questions
sect
iv
of
the
component
parts
of
our
reasonings
concerning
cause
and
effect
though
the
mind
in
its
reasonings
from
causes
or
effects
carries
its
view
beyond
those
objects
which
it
sees
or
remembers
it
must
never
lose
sight
of
them
entirely
nor
reason
merely
upon
its
own
ideas
without
some
mixture
of
impressions
or
at
least
of
ideas
of
the
memory
which
are
equivalent
to
impressions
when
we
infer
effects
from
causes
we
must
establish
the
existence
of
these
causes
which
we
have
only
two
ways
of
doing
either
by
an
immediate
perception
of
our
memory
or
senses
or
by
an
inference
from
other
causes
which
causes
again
we
must
ascertain
in
the
same
manner
either
by
a
present
impression
or
by
an
inference
from
their
causes
and
so
on
till
we
arrive
at
some
object
which
we
see
or
remember
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
carry
on
our
inferences
in
infinitum
and
the
only
thing
that
can
stop
them
is
an
impression
of
the
memory
or
senses
beyond
which
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
or
enquiry
to
give
an
instance
of
this
we
may
chuse
any
point
of
history
and
consider
for
what
reason
we
either
believe
or
reject
it
thus
we
believe
that
caesar
was
killed
in
the
on
the
ides
of
march
and
that
because
this
fact
is
established
on
the
unanimous
testimony
of
historians
who
agree
to
assign
this
precise
time
and
place
to
that
event
here
are
certain
characters
and
letters
present
either
to
our
memory
or
senses
which
characters
we
likewise
remember
to
have
been
used
as
the
signs
of
certain
ideas
and
these
ideas
were
either
in
the
minds
of
such
as
were
immediately
present
at
that
action
and
received
the
ideas
directly
from
its
existence
or
they
were
derived
from
the
testimony
of
others
and
that
again
from
another
testimony
by
a
visible
gradation
it
will
we
arrive
at
those
who
were
eyewitnesses
and
spectators
of
the
event
it
is
obvious
all
this
chain
of
argument
or
connexion
of
causes
and
effects
is
at
first
founded
on
those
characters
or
letters
which
are
seen
or
remembered
and
that
without
the
authority
either
of
the
memory
or
senses
our
whole
reasoning
would
be
chimerical
and
without
foundation
every
link
of
the
chain
would
in
that
case
hang
upon
another
but
there
would
not
be
any
thing
fixed
to
one
end
of
it
capable
of
sustaining
the
whole
and
consequently
there
would
be
no
belief
nor
evidence
and
this
actually
is
the
case
with
all
hypothetical
arguments
or
reasonings
upon
a
supposition
there
being
in
them
neither
any
present
impression
nor
belief
of
a
real
existence
i
need
not
observe
that
it
is
no
just
objection
to
the
present
doctrine
that
we
can
reason
upon
our
past
conclusions
or
principles
without
having
recourse
to
those
impressions
from
which
they
first
arose
for
even
supposing
these
impressions
should
be
entirely
effaced
from
the
memory
the
conviction
they
produced
may
still
remain
and
it
is
equally
true
that
all
reasonings
concerning
causes
and
effects
are
originally
derived
from
some
impression
in
the
same
manner
as
the
assurance
of
a
demonstration
proceeds
always
from
a
comparison
of
ideas
though
it
may
continue
after
the
comparison
is
forgot
sect
of
the
impressions
of
the
senses
and
memory
in
this
kind
of
reasoning
then
from
causation
we
employ
materials
which
are
of
a
mixed
and
heterogeneous
nature
and
which
however
connected
are
yet
essentially
different
from
each
other
all
our
arguments
concerning
causes
and
effects
consist
both
of
an
impression
of
the
memory
or
senses
and
of
the
idea
of
that
existence
which
produces
the
object
of
the
impression
or
is
produced
by
it
here
therefore
we
have
three
things
to
explain
viz
first
the
original
impression
secondly
the
transition
to
the
idea
of
the
connected
cause
or
effect
thirdly
the
nature
and
qualities
of
that
idea
as
to
those
impressions
which
arise
from
the
senses
their
ultimate
cause
is
in
my
opinion
perfectly
inexplicable
by
human
reason
and
it
will
always
be
impossible
to
decide
with
certainty
whether
they
arise
immediately
from
the
object
or
are
produced
by
the
creative
power
of
the
mind
or
are
derived
from
the
author
of
our
being
nor
is
such
a
question
any
way
material
to
our
present
purpose
we
may
draw
inferences
from
the
coherence
of
our
perceptions
whether
they
be
true
or
false
whether
they
represent
nature
justly
or
be
mere
illusions
of
the
senses
when
we
search
for
the
characteristic
which
distinguishes
the
memory
from
the
imagination
we
must
immediately
perceive
that
it
can
not
lie
in
the
simple
ideas
it
presents
to
us
since
both
these
faculties
borrow
their
simple
ideas
from
the
impressions
and
can
never
go
beyond
these
original
perceptions
these
faculties
are
as
little
distinguished
from
each
other
by
the
arrangement
of
their
complex
ideas
for
though
it
be
a
peculiar
property
of
the
memory
to
preserve
the
original
order
and
position
of
its
ideas
while
the
imagination
transposes
and
changes
them
as
it
pleases
yet
this
difference
is
not
sufficient
to
distinguish
them
in
their
operation
or
make
us
know
the
one
from
the
other
it
being
impossible
to
recal
the
past
impressions
in
order
to
compare
them
with
our
present
ideas
and
see
whether
their
arrangement
be
exactly
similar
since
therefore
the
memory
is
known
neither
by
the
order
of
its
complex
ideas
nor
the
nature
of
its
simple
ones
it
follows
that
the
difference
betwixt
it
and
the
imagination
lies
in
its
superior
force
and
vivacity
a
man
may
indulge
his
fancy
in
feigning
any
past
scene
of
adventures
nor
would
there
be
any
possibility
of
distinguishing
this
from
a
remembrance
of
a
like
kind
were
not
the
ideas
of
the
imagination
fainter
and
more
obscure
it
frequently
happens
that
when
two
men
have
been
engaged
in
any
scene
of
action
the
one
shall
remember
it
much
better
than
the
other
and
shall
have
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
make
his
companion
recollect
it
he
runs
over
several
circumstances
in
vain
mentions
the
time
the
place
the
company
what
was
said
what
was
done
on
all
sides
till
at
last
he
hits
on
some
lucky
circumstance
that
revives
the
whole
and
gives
his
friend
a
perfect
memory
of
every
thing
here
the
person
that
forgets
receives
at
first
all
the
ideas
from
the
discourse
of
the
other
with
the
same
circumstances
of
time
and
place
though
he
considers
them
as
mere
fictions
of
the
imagination
but
as
soon
as
the
circumstance
is
mentioned
that
touches
the
memory
the
very
same
ideas
now
appear
in
a
new
light
and
have
in
a
manner
a
different
feeling
from
what
they
had
before
without
any
other
alteration
beside
that
of
the
feeling
they
become
immediately
ideas
of
the
memory
and
are
assented
to
since
therefore
the
imagination
can
represent
all
the
same
objects
that
the
memory
can
offer
to
us
and
since
those
faculties
are
only
distinguished
by
the
different
feeling
of
the
ideas
they
present
it
may
be
proper
to
consider
what
is
the
nature
of
that
feeling
and
here
i
believe
every
one
will
readily
agree
with
me
that
the
ideas
of
the
memory
are
more
strong
and
lively
than
those
of
the
fancy
a
painter
who
intended
to
represent
a
passion
or
emotion
of
any
kind
would
endeavour
to
get
a
sight
of
a
person
actuated
by
a
like
emotion
in
order
to
enliven
his
ideas
and
give
them
a
force
and
vivacity
superior
to
what
is
found
in
those
which
are
mere
fictions
of
the
imagination
the
more
recent
this
memory
is
the
clearer
is
the
idea
and
when
after
a
long
interval
he
would
return
to
the
contemplation
of
his
object
he
always
finds
its
idea
to
be
much
decayed
if
not
wholly
obliterated
we
are
frequently
in
doubt
concerning
the
ideas
of
the
memory
as
they
become
very
weak
and
feeble
and
are
at
a
loss
to
determine
whether
any
image
proceeds
from
the
fancy
or
the
memory
when
it
is
not
drawn
in
such
lively
colours
as
distinguish
that
latter
faculty
i
think
i
remember
such
an
event
says
one
but
am
not
sure
a
long
tract
of
time
has
almost
worn
it
out
of
my
memory
and
leaves
me
uncertain
whether
or
not
it
be
the
pure
offspring
of
my
fancy
and
as
an
idea
of
the
memory
by
losing
its
force
and
vivacity
may
degenerate
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
taken
for
an
idea
of
the
imagination
so
on
the
other
hand
an
idea
of
the
imagination
may
acquire
such
a
force
and
vivacity
as
to
pass
for
an
idea
of
the
memory
and
counterfeit
its
effects
on
the
belief
and
judgment
this
is
noted
in
the
case
of
liars
who
by
the
frequent
repetition
of
their
lies
come
at
last
to
believe
and
remember
them
as
realities
custom
and
habit
having
in
this
case
as
in
many
others
the
same
influence
on
the
mind
as
nature
and
infixing
the
idea
with
equal
force
and
vigour
thus
it
appears
that
the
belief
or
assent
which
always
attends
the
memory
and
senses
is
nothing
but
the
vivacity
of
those
perceptions
they
present
and
that
this
alone
distinguishes
them
from
the
imagination
to
believe
is
in
this
case
to
feel
an
immediate
impression
of
the
senses
or
a
repetition
of
that
impression
in
the
memory
it
is
merely
the
force
and
liveliness
of
the
perception
which
constitutes
the
first
act
of
the
judgment
and
lays
the
foundation
of
that
reasoning
which
we
build
upon
it
when
we
trace
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
sect
vi
of
the
inference
from
the
impression
to
the
idea
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
in
tracing
this
relation
the
inference
we
draw
from
cause
to
effect
is
not
derived
merely
from
a
survey
of
these
particular
objects
and
from
such
a
penetration
into
their
essences
as
may
discover
the
dependance
of
the
one
upon
the
other
there
is
no
object
which
implies
the
existence
of
any
other
if
we
consider
these
objects
in
themselves
and
never
look
beyond
the
ideas
which
we
form
of
them
such
an
inference
would
amount
to
knowledge
and
would
imply
the
absolute
contradiction
and
impossibility
of
conceiving
any
thing
different
but
as
all
distinct
ideas
are
separable
it
is
evident
there
can
be
no
impossibility
of
that
kind
when
we
pass
from
a
present
impression
to
the
idea
of
any
object
we
might
possibly
have
separated
the
idea
from
the
impression
and
have
substituted
any
other
idea
in
its
room
it
is
therefore
by
experience
only
that
we
can
infer
the
existence
of
one
object
from
that
of
another
the
nature
of
experience
is
this
we
remember
to
have
had
frequent
instances
of
the
existence
of
one
species
of
objects
and
also
remember
that
the
individuals
of
another
species
of
objects
have
always
attended
them
and
have
existed
in
a
regular
order
of
contiguity
and
succession
with
regard
to
them
thus
we
remember
to
have
seen
that
species
of
object
we
call
flame
and
to
have
felt
that
species
of
sensation
we
call
heat
we
likewise
call
to
mind
their
constant
conjunction
in
all
past
instances
without
any
farther
ceremony
we
call
the
one
cause
and
the
other
effect
and
infer
the
existence
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
in
all
those
instances
from
which
we
learn
the
conjunction
of
particular
causes
and
effects
both
the
causes
and
effects
have
been
perceived
by
the
senses
and
are
remembered
but
in
all
cases
wherein
we
reason
concerning
them
there
is
only
one
perceived
or
remembered
and
the
other
is
supplyed
in
conformity
to
our
past
experience
thus
in
advancing
we
have
insensibly
discovered
a
new
relation
betwixt
cause
and
effect
when
we
least
expected
it
and
were
entirely
employed
upon
another
subject
this
relation
is
their
constant
conjunction
contiguity
and
succession
are
not
sufficient
to
make
us
pronounce
any
two
objects
to
be
cause
and
effect
unless
we
perceive
that
these
two
relations
are
preserved
in
several
instances
we
may
now
see
the
advantage
of
quitting
the
direct
survey
of
this
relation
in
order
to
discover
the
nature
of
that
necessary
connexion
which
makes
so
essential
a
part
of
it
there
are
hopes
that
by
this
means
we
may
at
last
arrive
at
our
proposed
end
though
to
tell
the
truth
this
relation
of
a
constant
conjunction
seems
to
advance
us
but
very
little
in
our
way
for
it
implies
no
more
than
this
that
like
objects
have
always
been
placed
in
like
relations
of
contiguity
and
succession
and
it
seems
evident
at
least
at
first
sight
that
by
this
means
we
can
never
discover
any
new
idea
and
can
only
multiply
but
not
enlarge
the
objects
of
our
mind
it
may
be
thought
that
what
we
learn
not
from
one
object
we
can
never
learn
from
a
hundred
which
are
all
of
the
same
kind
and
are
perfectly
resembling
in
every
circumstance
as
our
senses
shew
us
in
one
instance
two
bodies
or
motions
or
qualities
in
certain
relations
of
success
and
contiguity
so
our
memory
presents
us
only
with
a
multitude
of
instances
wherein
we
always
find
like
bodies
motions
or
qualities
in
like
relations
from
the
mere
repetition
of
any
past
impression
even
to
infinity
there
never
will
arise
any
new
original
idea
such
as
that
of
a
necessary
connexion
and
the
number
of
impressions
has
in
this
case
no
more
effect
than
if
we
confined
ourselves
to
one
only
but
though
this
reasoning
seems
just
and
obvious
yet
as
it
would
be
folly
to
despair
too
soon
we
shall
continue
the
thread
of
our
discourse
and
having
found
that
after
the
discovery
of
the
constant
conjunction
of
any
objects
we
always
draw
an
inference
from
one
object
to
another
we
shall
now
examine
the
nature
of
that
inference
and
of
the
transition
from
the
impression
to
the
idea
perhaps
it
will
appear
in
the
end
that
the
necessary
connexion
depends
on
the
inference
instead
of
the
inference
depending
on
the
necessary
connexion
since
it
appears
that
the
transition
from
an
impression
present
to
the
memory
or
senses
to
the
idea
of
an
object
which
we
call
cause
or
effect
is
founded
on
past
experience
and
on
our
remembrance
of
their
constant
conjunction
the
next
question
is
whether
experience
produces
the
idea
by
means
of
the
understanding
or
imagination
whether
we
are
determined
by
reason
to
make
the
transition
or
by
a
certain
association
and
relation
of
perceptions
if
reason
determined
us
it
would
proceed
upon
that
principle
that
instances
of
which
we
have
had
no
experience
must
resemble
those
of
which
we
have
had
experience
and
that
the
course
of
nature
continues
always
uniformly
the
same
in
order
therefore
to
clear
up
this
matter
let
us
consider
all
the
arguments
upon
which
such
a
proposition
may
be
supposed
to
be
founded
and
as
these
must
be
derived
either
from
knowledge
or
probability
let
us
cast
our
eye
on
each
of
these
degrees
of
evidence
and
see
whether
they
afford
any
just
conclusion
of
this
nature
our
foregoing
method
of
reasoning
will
easily
convince
us
that
there
can
be
no
demonstrative
arguments
to
prove
that
those
instances
of
which
we
have
had
no
experience
resemble
those
of
which
we
have
had
experience
we
can
at
least
conceive
a
change
in
the
course
of
nature
which
sufficiently
proves
that
such
a
change
is
not
absolutely
impossible
to
form
a
clear
idea
of
any
thing
is
an
undeniable
argument
for
its
possibility
and
is
alone
a
refutation
of
any
pretended
demonstration
against
it
probability
as
it
discovers
not
the
relations
of
ideas
considered
as
such
but
only
those
of
objects
must
in
some
respects
be
founded
on
the
impressions
of
our
memory
and
senses
and
in
some
respects
on
our
ideas
were
there
no
mixture
of
any
impression
in
our
probable
reasonings
the
conclusion
would
be
entirely
chimerical
and
were
there
no
mixture
of
ideas
the
action
of
the
mind
in
observing
the
relation
would
properly
speaking
be
sensation
not
reasoning
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
in
all
probable
reasonings
there
be
something
present
to
the
mind
either
seen
or
remembered
and
that
from
this
we
infer
something
connected
with
it
which
is
not
seen
nor
remembered
the
only
connexion
or
relation
of
objects
which
can
lead
us
beyond
the
immediate
impressions
of
our
memory
and
senses
is
that
of
cause
and
effect
and
that
because
it
is
the
only
one
on
which
we
can
found
a
just
inference
from
one
object
to
another
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
is
derived
from
experience
which
informs
us
that
such
particular
objects
in
all
past
instances
have
been
constantly
conjoined
with
each
other
and
as
an
object
similar
to
one
of
these
is
supposed
to
be
immediately
present
in
its
impression
we
thence
presume
on
the
existence
of
one
similar
to
its
usual
attendant
according
to
this
account
of
things
which
is
i
think
in
every
point
unquestionable
probability
is
founded
on
the
presumption
of
a
resemblance
betwixt
those
objects
of
which
we
have
had
experience
and
those
of
which
we
have
had
none
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
this
presumption
can
arise
from
probability
the
same
principle
can
not
be
both
the
cause
and
effect
of
another
and
this
is
perhaps
the
only
proposition
concerning
that
relation
which
is
either
intuitively
or
demonstratively
certain
should
any
one
think
to
elude
this
argument
and
without
determining
whether
our
reasoning
on
this
subject
be
derived
from
demonstration
or
probability
pretend
that
all
conclusions
from
causes
and
effects
are
built
on
solid
reasoning
i
can
only
desire
that
this
reasoning
may
be
produced
in
order
to
be
exposed
to
our
examination
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
after
experience
of
the
constant
conjunction
of
certain
objects
we
reason
in
the
following
manner
such
an
object
is
always
found
to
produce
another
it
is
impossible
it
coued
have
this
effect
if
it
was
not
endowed
with
a
power
of
production
the
power
necessarily
implies
the
effect
and
therefore
there
is
a
just
foundation
for
drawing
a
conclusion
from
the
existence
of
one
object
to
that
of
its
usual
attendant
the
past
production
implies
a
power
the
power
implies
a
new
production
and
the
new
production
is
what
we
infer
from
the
power
and
the
past
production
it
were
easy
for
me
to
shew
the
weakness
of
this
reasoning
were
i
willing
to
make
use
of
those
observations
i
have
already
made
that
the
idea
of
production
is
the
same
with
that
of
causation
and
that
no
existence
certainly
and
demonstratively
implies
a
power
in
any
other
object
or
were
it
proper
to
anticipate
what
i
shall
have
occasion
to
remark
afterwards
concerning
the
idea
we
form
of
power
and
efficacy
but
as
such
a
method
of
proceeding
may
seem
either
to
weaken
my
system
by
resting
one
part
of
it
on
another
or
to
breed
a
confusion
in
my
reasoning
i
shall
endeavour
to
maintain
my
present
assertion
without
any
such
assistance
it
shall
therefore
be
allowed
for
a
moment
that
the
production
of
one
object
by
another
in
any
one
instance
implies
a
power
and
that
this
power
is
connected
with
its
effect
but
it
having
been
already
proved
that
the
power
lies
not
in
the
sensible
qualities
of
the
cause
and
there
being
nothing
but
the
sensible
qualities
present
to
us
i
ask
why
in
other
instances
you
presume
that
the
same
power
still
exists
merely
upon
the
appearance
of
these
qualities
your
appeal
to
past
experience
decides
nothing
in
the
present
case
and
at
the
utmost
can
only
prove
that
that
very
object
which
produced
any
other
was
at
that
very
instant
endowed
with
such
a
power
but
can
never
prove
that
the
same
power
must
continue
in
the
same
object
or
collection
of
sensible
qualities
much
less
that
a
like
power
is
always
conjoined
with
like
sensible
qualities
should
it
be
said
that
we
have
experience
that
the
same
power
continues
united
with
the
same
object
and
that
like
objects
are
endowed
with
like
powers
i
would
renew
my
question
why
from
this
experience
we
form
any
conclusion
beyond
those
past
instances
of
which
we
have
had
experience
if
you
answer
this
question
in
the
same
manner
as
the
preceding
your
answer
gives
still
occasion
to
a
new
question
of
the
same
kind
even
in
infinitum
which
clearly
proves
that
the
foregoing
reasoning
had
no
just
foundation
thus
not
only
our
reason
fails
us
in
the
discovery
of
the
ultimate
connexion
of
causes
and
effects
but
even
after
experience
has
informed
us
of
their
constant
conjunction
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
satisfy
ourselves
by
our
reason
why
we
should
extend
that
experience
beyond
those
particular
instances
which
have
fallen
under
our
observation
we
suppose
but
are
never
able
to
prove
that
there
must
be
a
resemblance
betwixt
those
objects
of
which
we
have
had
experience
and
those
which
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
our
discovery
we
have
already
taken
notice
of
certain
relations
which
make
us
pass
from
one
object
to
another
even
though
there
be
no
reason
to
determine
us
to
that
transition
and
this
we
may
establish
for
a
general
rule
that
wherever
the
mind
constantly
and
uniformly
makes
a
transition
without
any
reason
it
is
influenced
by
these
relations
now
this
is
exactly
the
present
case
reason
can
never
shew
us
the
connexion
of
one
object
with
another
though
aided
by
experience
and
the
observation
of
their
constant
conjunction
in
all
past
instances
when
the
mind
therefore
passes
from
the
idea
or
impression
of
one
object
to
the
idea
or
belief
of
another
it
is
not
determined
by
reason
but
by
certain
principles
which
associate
together
the
ideas
of
these
objects
and
unite
them
in
the
imagination
had
ideas
no
more
union
in
the
fancy
than
objects
seem
to
have
to
the
understanding
we
coued
never
draw
any
inference
from
causes
to
effects
nor
repose
belief
in
any
matter
of
fact
the
inference
therefore
depends
solely
on
the
union
of
ideas
the
principles
of
union
among
ideas
i
have
reduced
to
three
general
ones
and
have
asserted
that
the
idea
or
impression
of
any
object
naturally
introduces
the
idea
of
any
other
object
that
is
resembling
contiguous
to
or
connected
with
it
these
principles
i
allow
to
be
neither
the
infallible
nor
the
sole
causes
of
an
union
among
ideas
they
are
not
the
infallible
causes
for
one
may
fix
his
attention
during
sometime
on
any
one
object
without
looking
farther
they
are
not
the
sole
causes
for
the
thought
has
evidently
a
very
irregular
motion
in
running
along
its
objects
and
may
leap
from
the
heavens
to
the
earth
from
one
end
of
the
creation
to
the
other
without
any
certain
method
or
order
but
though
i
allow
this
weakness
in
these
three
relations
and
this
irregularity
in
the
imagination
yet
i
assert
that
the
only
general
principles
which
associate
ideas
are
resemblance
contiguity
and
causation
there
is
indeed
a
principle
of
union
among
ideas
which
at
first
sight
may
be
esteemed
different
from
any
of
these
but
will
be
found
at
the
bottom
to
depend
on
the
same
origin
when
every
individual
of
any
species
of
objects
is
found
by
experience
to
be
constantly
united
with
an
individual
of
another
species
the
appearance
of
any
new
individual
of
either
species
naturally
conveys
the
thought
to
its
usual
attendant
thus
because
such
a
particular
idea
is
commonly
annexed
to
such
a
particular
word
nothing
is
required
but
the
hearing
of
that
word
to
produce
the
correspondent
idea
and
it
will
scarce
be
possible
for
the
mind
by
its
utmost
efforts
to
prevent
that
transition
in
this
case
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
that
upon
hearing
such
a
particular
sound
we
should
reflect
on
any
past
experience
and
consider
what
idea
has
been
usually
connected
with
the
sound
the
imagination
of
itself
supplies
the
place
of
this
reflection
and
is
so
accustomed
to
pass
from
the
word
to
the
idea
that
it
interposes
not
a
moment
delay
betwixt
the
hearing
of
the
one
and
the
conception
of
the
other
but
though
i
acknowledge
this
to
be
a
true
principle
of
association
among
ideas
i
assert
it
to
be
the
very
same
with
that
betwixt
the
ideas
of
cause
and
effects
and
to
be
an
essential
part
in
all
our
reasonings
from
that
relation
we
have
no
other
notion
of
cause
and
effect
but
that
of
certain
objects
which
have
been
always
conjoined
together
and
which
in
all
past
instances
have
been
found
inseparable
we
can
not
penetrate
into
the
reason
of
the
conjunction
we
only
observe
the
thing
itself
and
always
find
that
from
the
constant
conjunction
the
objects
acquire
an
union
in
the
imagination
when
the
impression
of
one
becomes
present
to
us
we
immediately
form
an
idea
of
its
usual
attendant
and
consequently
we
may
establish
this
as
one
part
of
the
definition
of
an
opinion
or
belief
that
it
is
an
idea
related
to
or
associated
with
a
present
impression
thus
though
causation
be
a
philosophical
relation
as
implying
contiguity
succession
and
constant
conjunction
yet
it
is
only
so
far
as
it
is
a
natural
relation
and
produces
an
union
among
our
ideas
that
we
are
able
to
reason
upon
it
or
draw
any
inference
from
it
sect
vii
of
the
nature
of
the
idea
or
belief
the
idea
of
an
object
is
an
essential
part
of
the
belief
of
it
but
not
the
whole
we
conceive
many
things
which
we
do
not
believe
in
order
then
to
discover
more
fully
the
nature
of
belief
or
the
qualities
of
those
ideas
we
assent
to
let
us
weigh
the
following
considerations
it
is
evident
that
all
reasonings
from
causes
or
effects
terminate
in
conclusions
concerning
matter
of
fact
that
is
concerning
the
existence
of
objects
or
of
their
qualities
it
is
also
evident
that
the
idea
of
existence
is
nothing
different
from
the
idea
of
any
object
and
that
when
after
the
simple
conception
of
any
thing
we
would
conceive
it
as
existent
we
in
reality
make
no
addition
to
or
alteration
on
our
first
idea
thus
when
we
affirm
that
god
is
existent
we
simply
form
the
idea
of
such
a
being
as
he
is
represented
to
us
nor
is
the
existence
which
we
attribute
to
him
conceived
by
a
particular
idea
which
we
join
to
the
idea
of
his
other
qualities
and
can
again
separate
and
distinguish
from
them
but
i
go
farther
and
not
content
with
asserting
that
the
conception
of
the
existence
of
any
object
is
no
addition
to
the
simple
conception
of
it
i
likewise
maintain
that
the
belief
of
the
existence
joins
no
new
ideas
to
those
which
compose
the
idea
of
the
object
when
i
think
of
god
when
i
think
of
him
as
existent
and
when
i
believe
him
to
be
existent
my
idea
of
him
neither
encreases
nor
diminishes
but
as
it
is
certain
there
is
a
great
difference
betwixt
the
simple
conception
of
the
existence
of
an
object
and
the
belief
of
it
and
as
this
difference
lies
not
in
the
parts
or
composition
of
the
idea
which
we
conceive
it
follows
that
it
must
lie
in
the
manner
in
which
we
conceive
it
suppose
a
person
present
with
me
who
advances
propositions
to
which
i
do
not
assent
that
caesar
dyed
in
his
bed
that
silver
is
more
fusible
than
lead
or
mercury
heavier
than
gold
it
is
evident
that
notwithstanding
my
incredulity
i
clearly
understand
his
meaning
and
form
all
the
same
ideas
which
he
forms
my
imagination
is
endowed
with
the
same
powers
as
his
nor
is
it
possible
for
him
to
conceive
any
idea
which
i
can
not
conceive
nor
conjoin
any
which
i
can
not
conjoin
i
therefore
ask
wherein
consists
the
difference
betwixt
believing
and
disbelieving
any
proposition
the
answer
is
easy
with
regard
to
propositions
that
are
proved
by
intuition
or
demonstration
in
that
case
the
person
who
assents
not
only
conceives
the
ideas
according
to
the
proposition
but
is
necessarily
determined
to
conceive
them
in
that
particular
manner
either
immediately
or
by
the
interposition
of
other
ideas
whatever
is
absurd
is
unintelligible
nor
is
it
possible
for
the
imagination
to
conceive
any
thing
contrary
to
a
demonstration
but
as
in
reasonings
from
causation
and
concerning
matters
of
fact
this
absolute
necessity
can
not
take
place
and
the
imagination
is
free
to
conceive
both
sides
of
the
question
i
still
ask
wherein
consists
the
deference
betwixt
incredulity
and
belief
since
in
both
cases
the
conception
of
the
idea
is
equally
possible
and
requisite
it
will
not
be
a
satisfactory
answer
to
say
that
a
person
who
does
not
assent
to
a
proposition
you
advance
after
having
conceived
the
object
in
the
same
manner
with
you
immediately
conceives
it
in
a
different
manner
and
has
different
ideas
of
it
this
answer
is
unsatisfactory
not
because
it
contains
any
falshood
but
because
it
discovers
not
all
the
truth
it
is
contest
that
in
all
cases
wherein
we
dissent
from
any
person
we
conceive
both
sides
of
the
question
but
as
we
can
believe
only
one
it
evidently
follows
that
the
belief
must
make
some
difference
betwixt
that
conception
to
which
we
assent
and
that
from
which
we
dissent
we
may
mingle
and
unite
and
separate
and
confound
and
vary
our
ideas
in
a
hundred
different
ways
but
until
there
appears
some
principle
which
fixes
one
of
these
different
situations
we
have
in
reality
no
opinion
and
this
principle
as
it
plainly
makes
no
addition
to
our
precedent
ideas
can
only
change
the
manner
of
our
conceiving
them
all
the
perceptions
of
the
mind
are
of
two
kinds
viz
impressions
and
ideas
which
differ
from
each
other
only
in
their
different
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
our
ideas
are
copyed
from
our
impressions
and
represent
them
in
all
their
parts
when
you
would
any
way
vary
the
idea
of
a
particular
object
you
can
only
encrease
or
diminish
its
force
and
vivacity
if
you
make
any
other
change
on
it
it
represents
a
different
object
or
impression
the
case
is
the
same
as
in
colours
a
particular
shade
of
any
colour
may
acquire
a
new
degree
of
liveliness
or
brightness
without
any
other
variation
but
when
you
produce
any
other
variation
it
is
no
longer
the
same
shade
or
colour
so
that
as
belief
does
nothing
but
vary
the
manner
in
which
we
conceive
any
object
it
can
only
bestow
on
our
ideas
an
additional
force
and
vivacity
an
opinion
therefore
or
belief
may
be
most
accurately
defined
a
lively
idea
related
to
or
associated
with
a
present
impression
we
may
here
take
occasion
to
observe
a
very
remarkable
error
which
being
frequently
inculcated
in
the
schools
has
become
a
kind
of
establishd
maxim
and
is
universally
received
by
all
logicians
this
error
consists
in
the
vulgar
division
of
the
acts
of
the
understanding
into
conception
judgment
and
reasoning
and
in
the
definitions
we
give
of
them
conception
is
defind
to
be
the
simple
survey
of
one
or
more
ideas
judgment
to
be
the
separating
or
uniting
of
different
ideas
reasoning
to
be
the
separating
or
uniting
of
different
ideas
by
the
interposition
of
others
which
show
the
relation
they
bear
to
each
other
but
these
distinctions
and
definitions
are
faulty
in
very
considerable
articles
for
first
it
is
far
from
being
true
that
in
every
judgment
which
we
form
we
unite
two
different
ideas
since
in
that
proposition
god
is
or
indeed
any
other
which
regards
existence
the
idea
of
existence
is
no
distinct
idea
which
we
unite
with
that
of
the
object
and
which
is
capable
of
forming
a
compound
idea
by
the
union
secondly
as
we
can
thus
form
a
proposition
which
contains
only
one
idea
so
we
may
exert
our
reason
without
employing
more
than
two
ideas
and
without
having
recourse
to
a
third
to
serve
as
a
medium
betwixt
them
we
infer
a
cause
immediately
from
its
effect
and
this
inference
is
not
only
a
true
species
of
reasoning
but
the
strongest
of
all
others
and
more
convincing
than
when
we
interpose
another
idea
to
connect
the
two
extremes
what
we
may
in
general
affirm
concerning
these
three
acts
of
the
understanding
is
that
taking
them
in
a
proper
light
they
all
resolve
themselves
into
the
first
and
are
nothing
but
particular
ways
of
conceiving
our
objects
whether
we
consider
a
single
object
or
several
whether
we
dwell
on
these
objects
or
run
from
them
to
others
and
in
whatever
form
or
order
we
survey
them
the
act
of
the
mind
exceeds
not
a
simple
conception
and
the
only
remarkable
difference
which
occurs
on
this
occasion
is
when
we
join
belief
to
the
conception
and
are
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
what
we
conceive
this
act
of
the
mind
has
never
yet
been
explaind
by
any
philosopher
and
therefore
i
am
at
liberty
to
propose
my
hypothesis
concerning
it
which
is
that
it
is
only
a
strong
and
steady
conception
of
any
idea
and
such
as
approaches
in
some
measure
to
an
immediate
impression
footnote
footnote
here
are
the
heads
of
those
arguments
which
lead
us
to
this
conclusion
when
we
infer
the
existence
of
an
object
from
that
of
others
some
object
must
always
be
present
either
to
the
memory
or
senses
in
order
to
be
the
foundation
of
our
reasoning
since
the
mind
can
not
run
up
with
its
inferences
in
infinitum
reason
can
never
satisfy
us
that
the
existence
of
any
one
object
does
ever
imply
that
of
another
so
that
when
we
pass
from
the
impression
of
one
to
the
idea
or
belief
of
another
we
are
not
determined
by
reason
but
by
custom
or
a
principle
of
association
but
belief
is
somewhat
more
than
a
simple
idea
it
is
a
particular
manner
of
forming
an
idea
and
as
the
same
idea
can
only
be
varyed
by
a
variation
of
its
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
it
follows
upon
the
whole
that
belief
is
a
lively
idea
produced
by
a
relation
to
a
present
impression
according
to
the
foregoing
definition
this
operation
of
the
mind
which
forms
the
belief
of
any
matter
of
fact
seems
hitherto
to
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
philosophy
though
no
one
has
so
much
as
suspected
that
there
was
any
difficulty
in
explaining
it
for
my
part
i
must
own
that
i
find
a
considerable
difficulty
in
the
case
and
that
even
when
i
think
i
understand
the
subject
perfectly
i
am
at
a
loss
for
terms
to
express
my
meaning
i
conclude
by
an
induction
which
seems
to
me
very
evident
that
an
opinion
or
belief
is
nothing
but
an
idea
that
is
different
from
a
fiction
not
in
the
nature
or
the
order
of
its
parts
but
in
the
manner
of
its
being
conceived
but
when
i
would
explain
this
manner
i
scarce
find
any
word
that
fully
answers
the
case
but
am
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
every
one
feeling
in
order
to
give
him
a
perfect
notion
of
this
operation
of
the
mind
an
idea
assented
to
feels
different
from
a
fictitious
idea
that
the
fancy
alone
presents
to
us
and
this
different
feeling
i
endeavour
to
explain
by
calling
it
a
superior
force
or
vivacity
or
solidity
or
firmness
or
steadiness
this
variety
of
terms
which
may
seem
so
unphilosophical
is
intended
only
to
express
that
act
of
the
mind
which
renders
realities
more
present
to
us
than
fictions
causes
them
to
weigh
more
in
the
thought
and
gives
them
a
superior
influence
on
the
passions
and
imagination
provided
we
agree
about
the
thing
it
is
needless
to
dispute
about
the
terms
the
imagination
has
the
command
over
all
its
ideas
and
can
join
and
mix
and
vary
them
in
all
the
ways
possible
it
may
conceive
objects
with
all
the
circumstances
of
place
and
time
it
may
set
them
in
a
manner
before
our
eyes
in
their
true
colours
just
as
they
might
have
existed
but
as
it
is
impossible
that
that
faculty
can
ever
of
itself
reach
belief
it
is
evident
that
belief
consists
not
in
the
nature
and
order
of
our
ideas
but
in
the
manner
of
their
conception
and
in
their
feeling
to
the
mind
t
confess
that
it
is
impossible
to
explain
perfectly
this
feeling
or
manner
of
conception
we
may
make
use
of
words
that
express
something
near
it
but
its
true
and
proper
name
is
belief
which
is
a
term
that
every
one
sufficiently
understands
in
common
life
and
in
philosophy
we
can
go
no
farther
than
assert
that
it
is
something
felt
by
the
mind
which
distinguishes
the
ideas
of
the
judgment
from
the
fictions
of
the
imagination
it
gives
them
more
force
and
influence
makes
them
appear
of
greater
importance
infixes
them
in
the
mind
and
renders
them
the
governing
principles
of
all
our
actions
this
definition
will
also
be
found
to
be
entirely
conformable
to
every
one
feeling
and
experience
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
those
ideas
to
which
we
assent
are
more
strong
firm
and
vivid
than
the
loose
reveries
of
a
if
one
person
sits
down
to
read
a
book
as
a
romance
and
another
as
a
true
history
they
plainly
receive
the
same
ideas
and
in
the
same
order
nor
does
the
incredulity
of
the
one
and
the
belief
of
the
other
hinder
them
from
putting
the
very
same
sense
upon
their
author
his
words
produce
the
same
ideas
in
both
though
his
testimony
has
not
the
same
influence
on
them
the
latter
has
a
more
lively
conception
of
all
the
incidents
he
enters
deeper
into
the
concerns
of
the
persons
represents
to
himself
their
actions
and
characters
and
friendships
and
enmities
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
form
a
notion
of
their
features
and
air
and
person
while
the
former
who
gives
no
credit
to
the
testimony
of
the
author
has
a
more
faint
and
languid
conception
of
all
these
particulars
and
except
on
account
of
the
style
and
ingenuity
of
the
composition
can
receive
little
entertainment
from
it
sect
viii
of
the
causes
of
belief
having
thus
explained
the
nature
of
belief
and
shewn
that
it
consists
in
a
lively
idea
related
to
a
present
impression
let
us
now
proceed
to
examine
from
what
principles
it
is
derived
and
what
bestows
the
vivacity
on
the
idea
i
would
willingly
establish
it
as
a
general
maxim
in
the
science
of
human
nature
that
when
any
impression
becomes
present
to
us
it
not
only
transports
the
mind
to
such
ideas
as
are
related
to
it
but
likewise
communicates
to
them
a
share
of
its
force
and
vivacity
all
the
operations
of
the
mind
depend
in
a
great
measure
on
its
disposition
when
it
performs
them
and
according
as
the
spirits
are
more
or
less
elevated
and
the
attention
more
or
less
fixed
the
action
will
always
have
more
or
less
vigour
and
vivacity
when
therefore
any
object
is
presented
which
elevates
and
enlivens
the
thought
every
action
to
which
the
mind
applies
itself
will
be
more
strong
and
vivid
as
tong
as
that
disposition
continues
now
it
is
evident
the
continuance
of
the
disposition
depends
entirely
on
the
objects
about
which
the
mind
is
employed
and
that
any
new
object
naturally
gives
a
new
direction
to
the
spirits
and
changes
the
disposition
as
on
the
contrary
when
the
mind
fixes
constantly
on
the
same
object
or
passes
easily
and
insensibly
along
related
objects
the
disposition
has
a
much
longer
duration
hence
it
happens
that
when
the
mind
is
once
inlivened
by
a
present
impression
it
proceeds
to
form
a
more
lively
idea
of
the
related
objects
by
a
natural
transition
of
the
disposition
from
the
one
to
the
other
the
change
of
the
objects
is
so
easy
that
the
mind
is
scarce
sensible
of
it
but
applies
itself
to
the
conception
of
the
related
idea
with
all
the
force
and
vivacity
it
acquired
from
the
present
impression
if
in
considering
the
nature
of
relation
and
that
facility
of
transition
which
is
essential
to
it
we
can
satisfy
ourselves
concerning
the
reality
of
this
phaenomenon
it
is
well
but
i
must
confess
i
place
my
chief
confidence
in
experience
to
prove
so
material
a
principle
we
may
therefore
observe
as
the
first
experiment
to
our
present
purpose
that
upon
the
appearance
of
the
picture
of
an
absent
friend
our
idea
of
him
is
evidently
inlivened
by
the
resemblance
and
that
every
passion
which
that
idea
occasions
whether
of
joy
or
sorrow
acquires
new
force
and
vigour
in
producing
this
effect
there
concur
both
a
relation
and
a
present
impression
where
the
picture
bears
him
no
resemblance
or
at
least
was
not
intended
for
him
it
never
so
much
as
conveys
our
thought
to
him
and
where
it
is
absent
as
well
as
the
person
though
the
mind
may
pass
from
the
thought
of
the
one
to
that
of
the
other
it
feels
its
idea
to
be
rather
weekend
than
inlivened
by
that
transition
we
take
a
pleasure
in
viewing
the
picture
of
a
friend
when
it
is
set
before
us
but
when
it
is
removed
rather
choose
to
consider
him
directly
than
by
reflexion
in
an
image
which
is
equally
distinct
and
obscure
the
ceremonies
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
may
be
considered
as
experiments
of
the
same
nature
the
devotees
of
that
strange
superstition
usually
plead
in
excuse
of
the
mummeries
with
which
they
are
upbraided
that
they
feel
the
good
effect
of
those
external
motions
and
postures
and
actions
in
enlivening
their
devotion
and
quickening
their
fervour
which
otherwise
would
decay
away
if
directed
entirely
to
distant
and
immaterial
objects
we
shadow
out
the
objects
of
our
faith
say
they
in
sensible
types
and
images
and
render
them
more
present
to
us
by
the
immediate
presence
of
these
types
than
it
is
possible
for
us
to
do
merely
by
an
intellectual
view
and
contemplation
sensible
objects
have
always
a
greater
influence
on
the
fancy
than
any
other
and
this
influence
they
readily
convey
to
those
ideas
to
which
they
are
related
and
which
they
resemble
i
shall
only
infer
from
these
practices
and
this
reasoning
that
the
effect
of
resemblance
in
inlivening
the
idea
is
very
common
and
as
in
every
case
a
resemblance
and
a
present
impression
must
concur
we
are
abundantly
supplyed
with
experiments
to
prove
the
reality
of
the
foregoing
principle
we
may
add
force
to
these
experiments
by
others
of
a
different
kind
in
considering
the
effects
of
contiguity
as
well
as
of
resemblance
it
is
certain
that
distance
diminishes
the
force
of
every
idea
and
that
upon
our
approach
to
any
object
though
it
does
not
discover
itself
to
our
senses
it
operates
upon
the
mind
with
an
influence
that
imitates
an
immediate
impression
the
thinking
on
any
object
readily
transports
the
mind
to
what
is
contiguous
but
it
is
only
the
actual
presence
of
an
object
that
transports
it
with
a
superior
vivacity
when
i
am
a
few
miles
from
home
whatever
relates
to
it
touches
me
more
nearly
than
when
i
am
two
hundred
leagues
distant
though
even
at
that
distance
the
reflecting
on
any
thing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
my
friends
and
family
naturally
produces
an
idea
of
them
but
as
in
this
latter
case
both
the
objects
of
the
mind
are
ideas
notwithstanding
there
is
an
easy
transition
betwixt
them
that
transition
alone
is
not
able
to
give
a
superior
vivacity
to
any
of
the
ideas
for
want
of
some
immediate
impression

he
said
attribute
to
instinct
or
to
some
kind
of

the
fact
that
when
we
see
those
places
in
which
we
are
told
notable
men
spent
much
of
their
time
we
are
more
powerfully
affected
than
when
we
hear
of
the
exploits
of
the
men
themselves
or
read
something
written
this
is
just
what
is
happening
to
me
now
for
i
am
reminded
of
plato
who
we
are
told
was
the
first
to
make
a
practice
of
holding
discussions
here
those
gardens
of
his
near
by
do
not
merely
put
me
in
mind
of
him
they
seem
to
set
the
man
himself
before
my
very
eyes
speusippus
was
here
so
was
xenocrates
so
was
his
pupil
polemo
and
that
very
seat
which
we
may
view
was
his
then
again
when
i
looked
at
our
i
mean
the
old
building
of
hostilius
not
this
new
one
when
it
was
enlarged
it
diminished
in
my
estimation
i
used
to
think
of
scipio
cato
laelius
and
in
particular
of
my
own
grandfather
such
is
the
power
of
places
to
evoke
associations
so
it
is
with
good
reason
that
they
are
used
as
a
basis
for
memory
training
no
one
can
doubt
but
causation
has
the
same
influence
as
the
other
two
relations
of
resemblance
and
contiguity
superstitious
people
are
fond
of
the
relicks
of
saints
and
holy
men
for
the
same
reason
that
they
seek
after
types
and
images
in
order
to
enliven
their
devotion
and
give
them
a
more
intimate
and
strong
conception
of
those
exemplary
lives
which
they
desire
to
imitate
now
it
is
evident
one
of
the
best
relicks
a
devotee
coued
procure
would
be
the
handywork
of
a
saint
and
if
his
cloaths
and
furniture
are
ever
to
be
considered
in
this
light
it
is
because
they
were
once
at
his
disposal
and
were
moved
and
affected
by
him
in
which
respect
they
are
to
be
considered
as
imperfect
effects
and
as
connected
with
him
by
a
shorter
chain
of
consequences
than
any
of
those
from
which
we
learn
the
reality
of
his
existence
this
phaenomenon
clearly
proves
that
a
present
impression
with
a
relation
of
causation
may
inliven
any
idea
and
consequently
produce
belief
or
assent
according
to
the
precedent
definition
of
it
but
why
need
we
seek
for
other
arguments
to
prove
that
a
present
impression
with
a
relation
or
transition
of
the
fancy
may
inliven
any
idea
when
this
very
instance
of
our
reasonings
from
cause
and
effect
will
alone
suffice
to
that
purpose
it
is
certain
we
must
have
an
idea
of
every
matter
of
fact
which
we
believe
it
is
certain
that
this
idea
arises
only
from
a
relation
to
a
present
impression
it
is
certain
that
the
belief
nothing
to
the
idea
but
only
changes
our
manner
of
conceiving
it
and
renders
it
more
strong
and
lively
the
present
conclusion
concerning
the
influence
of
relation
is
the
immediate
consequence
of
all
these
steps
and
every
step
appears
to
me
sure
end
infallible
there
enters
nothing
into
this
operation
of
the
mind
but
a
present
impression
a
lively
idea
and
a
relation
or
association
in
the
fancy
betwixt
the
impression
and
idea
so
that
there
can
be
no
suspicion
of
mistake
in
order
to
put
this
whole
affair
in
a
fuller
light
let
us
consider
it
as
a
question
in
natural
philosophy
which
we
must
determine
by
experience
and
observation
i
suppose
there
is
an
object
presented
from
which
i
draw
a
certain
conclusion
and
form
to
myself
ideas
which
i
am
said
to
believe
or
assent
to
here
it
is
evident
that
however
that
object
which
is
present
to
my
senses
and
that
other
whose
existence
i
infer
by
reasoning
may
be
thought
to
influence
each
other
by
their
particular
powers
or
qualities
yet
as
the
phenomenon
of
belief
which
we
at
present
examine
is
merely
internal
these
powers
and
qualities
being
entirely
unknown
can
have
no
hand
in
producing
it
it
is
the
present
impression
which
is
to
be
considered
as
the
true
and
real
cause
of
the
idea
and
of
the
belief
which
attends
it
we
must
therefore
endeavour
to
discover
by
experiments
the
particular
qualities
by
which
it
is
enabled
to
produce
so
extraordinary
an
effect
first
then
i
observe
that
the
present
impression
has
not
this
effect
by
its
own
proper
power
and
efficacy
and
when
considered
alone
as
a
single
perception
limited
to
the
present
moment
i
find
that
an
impression
from
which
on
its
first
appearance
i
can
draw
no
conclusion
may
afterwards
become
the
foundation
of
belief
when
i
have
had
experience
of
its
usual
consequences
we
must
in
every
case
have
observed
the
same
impression
in
past
instances
and
have
found
it
to
be
constantly
conjoined
with
some
other
impression
this
is
confirmed
by
such
a
multitude
of
experiments
that
it
admits
not
of
the
smallest
doubt
from
a
second
observation
i
conclude
that
the
belief
which
attends
the
present
impression
and
is
produced
by
a
number
of
past
impressions
and
conjunctions
that
this
belief
i
say
arises
immediately
without
any
new
operation
of
the
reason
or
imagination
of
this
i
can
be
certain
because
i
never
am
conscious
of
any
such
operation
and
find
nothing
in
the
subject
on
which
it
can
be
founded
now
as
we
call
every
thing
custom
which
proceeds
from
a
past
repetition
without
any
new
reasoning
or
conclusion
establish
it
as
a
certain
truth
that
all
the
belief
which
follows
upon
any
present
impression
is
derived
solely
from
that
origin
when
we
are
accustomed
to
see
two
impressions
conjoined
together
the
appearance
or
idea
of
the
one
immediately
carries
us
to
the
idea
of
the
other
being
fully
satisfyed
on
this
head
i
make
a
third
set
of
experiments
in
order
to
know
whether
any
thing
be
requisite
beside
the
customary
transition
towards
the
production
of
this
phaenomenon
of
belief
i
therefore
change
the
first
impression
into
an
idea
and
observe
that
though
the
customary
transition
to
the
correlative
idea
still
remains
yet
there
is
in
reality
no
belief
nor
perswasion
a
present
impression
then
is
absolutely
requisite
to
this
whole
operation
and
when
after
this
i
compare
an
impression
with
an
idea
and
find
that
their
only
difference
consists
in
their
different
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
i
conclude
upon
the
whole
that
belief
is
a
more
vivid
and
intense
conception
of
an
idea
proceeding
from
its
relation
to
a
present
impression
thus
all
probable
reasoning
is
nothing
but
a
species
of
sensation
it
is
not
solely
in
poetry
and
music
we
must
follow
our
taste
and
sentiment
but
likewise
in
philosophy
when
i
am
convinced
of
any
principle
it
is
only
an
idea
which
strikes
more
strongly
upon
me
when
i
give
the
preference
to
one
set
of
arguments
above
another
i
do
nothing
but
decide
from
my
feeling
concerning
the
superiority
of
their
influence
objects
have
no
discoverable
connexion
together
nor
is
it
from
any
other
principle
but
custom
operating
upon
the
imagination
that
we
can
draw
any
inference
from
the
appearance
of
one
to
the
existence
of
another
it
will
here
be
worth
our
observation
that
the
past
experience
on
which
all
our
judgments
concerning
cause
and
effect
depend
may
operate
on
our
mind
in
such
an
insensible
manner
as
never
to
be
taken
notice
of
and
may
even
in
some
measure
be
unknown
to
us
a
person
who
stops
short
in
his
journey
upon
meeting
a
river
in
his
way
foresees
the
consequences
of
his
proceeding
forward
and
his
knowledge
of
these
consequences
is
conveyed
to
him
by
past
experience
which
informs
him
of
such
certain
conjunctions
of
causes
and
effects
but
can
we
think
that
on
this
occasion
he
reflects
on
any
past
experience
and
calls
to
remembrance
instances
that
he
has
seen
or
heard
of
in
order
to
discover
the
effects
of
water
on
animal
bodies
no
surely
this
is
not
the
method
in
which
he
proceeds
in
his
reasoning
the
idea
of
sinking
is
so
closely
connected
with
that
of
water
and
the
idea
of
suffocating
with
that
of
sinking
that
the
mind
makes
the
transition
without
the
assistance
of
the
memory
the
custom
operates
before
we
have
time
for
reflection
the
objects
seem
so
inseparable
that
we
interpose
not
a
moment
delay
in
passing
from
the
one
to
the
other
but
as
this
transition
proceeds
from
experience
and
not
from
any
primary
connexion
betwixt
the
ideas
we
must
necessarily
acknowledge
that
experience
may
produce
a
belief
and
a
judgment
of
causes
and
effects
by
a
secret
operation
and
without
being
once
thought
of
this
removes
all
pretext
if
there
yet
remains
any
for
asserting
that
the
mind
is
convinced
by
reasoning
of
that
principle
that
instances
of
which
we
have
no
experience
must
necessarily
resemble
those
of
which
we
have
for
we
here
find
that
the
understanding
or
imagination
can
draw
inferences
from
past
experience
without
reflecting
on
it
much
more
without
forming
any
principle
concerning
it
or
reasoning
upon
that
principle
in
general
we
may
observe
that
in
all
the
most
established
and
uniform
conjunctions
of
causes
and
effects
such
as
those
of
gravity
impulse
solidity
the
mind
never
carries
its
view
expressly
to
consider
any
past
experience
though
in
other
associations
of
objects
which
are
more
rare
and
unusual
it
may
assist
the
custom
and
transition
of
ideas
by
this
reflection
nay
we
find
in
some
cases
that
the
reflection
produces
the
belief
without
the
custom
or
more
properly
speaking
that
the
reflection
produces
the
custom
in
an
oblique
and
artificial
manner
i
explain
myself
it
is
certain
that
not
only
in
philosophy
but
even
in
common
life
we
may
attain
the
knowledge
of
a
particular
cause
merely
by
one
experiment
provided
it
be
made
with
judgment
and
after
a
careful
removal
of
all
foreign
and
superfluous
circumstances
now
as
after
one
experiment
of
this
kind
the
mind
upon
the
appearance
either
of
the
cause
or
the
effect
can
draw
an
inference
concerning
the
existence
of
its
correlative
and
as
a
habit
can
never
be
acquired
merely
by
one
instance
it
may
be
thought
that
belief
can
not
in
this
case
be
esteemed
the
effect
of
custom
but
this
difficulty
will
vanish
if
we
consider
that
though
we
are
here
supposed
to
have
had
only
one
experiment
of
a
particular
effect
yet
we
have
many
millions
to
convince
us
of
this
principle
that
like
objects
placed
in
like
circumstances
will
always
produce
like
effects
and
as
this
principle
has
established
itself
by
a
sufficient
custom
it
bestows
an
evidence
and
firmness
on
any
opinion
to
which
it
can
be
applied
the
connexion
of
the
ideas
is
not
habitual
after
one
experiment
but
this
connexion
is
comprehended
under
another
principle
that
is
habitual
which
brings
us
back
to
our
hypothesis
in
all
cases
we
transfer
our
experience
to
instances
of
which
we
have
no
experience
either
expressly
or
tacitly
either
directly
or
indirectly
i
must
not
conclude
this
subject
without
observing
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
talk
of
the
operations
of
the
mind
with
perfect
propriety
and
exactness
because
common
language
has
seldom
made
any
very
nice
distinctions
among
them
but
has
generally
called
by
the
same
term
all
such
as
nearly
resemble
each
other
and
as
this
is
a
source
almost
inevitable
of
obscurity
and
confusion
in
the
author
so
it
may
frequently
give
rise
to
doubts
and
objections
in
the
reader
which
otherwise
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
thus
my
general
position
that
an
opinion
or
belief
is
nothing
but
a
strong
and
lively
idea
derived
from
a
present
impression
related
to
it
maybe
liable
to
the
following
objection
by
reason
of
a
little
ambiguity
in
those
words
strong
and
lively
it
may
be
said
that
not
only
an
impression
may
give
rise
to
reasoning
but
that
an
idea
may
also
have
the
same
influence
especially
upon
my
principle
that
all
our
ideas
are
derived
from
correspondent
impressions
for
suppose
i
form
at
present
an
idea
of
which
i
have
forgot
the
correspondent
impression
i
am
able
to
conclude
from
this
idea
that
such
an
impression
did
once
exist
and
as
this
conclusion
is
attended
with
belief
it
may
be
asked
from
whence
are
the
qualities
of
force
and
vivacity
derived
which
constitute
this
belief
and
to
this
i
answer
very
readily
from
the
present
idea
for
as
this
idea
is
not
here
considered
as
the
representation
of
any
absent
object
but
as
a
real
perception
in
the
mind
of
which
we
are
intimately
conscious
it
must
be
able
to
bestow
on
whatever
is
related
to
it
the
same
quality
call
it
firmness
or
solidity
or
force
or
vivacity
with
which
the
mind
reflects
upon
it
and
is
assured
of
its
present
existence
the
idea
here
supplies
the
place
of
an
impression
and
is
entirely
the
same
so
far
as
regards
our
present
purpose
upon
the
same
principles
we
need
not
be
surprized
to
hear
of
the
remembrance
of
an
idea
that
is
of
the
idea
of
an
idea
and
of
its
force
and
vivacity
superior
to
the
loose
conceptions
of
the
imagination
in
thinking
of
our
past
thoughts
we
not
only
delineate
out
the
objects
of
which
we
were
thinking
but
also
conceive
the
action
of
the
mind
in
the
meditation
that
certain
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
definition
or
description
but
which
every
one
sufficiently
understands
when
the
memory
offers
an
idea
of
this
and
represents
it
as
past
it
is
easily
conceived
how
that
idea
may
have
more
vigour
and
firmness
than
when
we
think
of
a
past
thought
of
which
we
have
no
remembrance
after
this
any
one
will
understand
how
we
may
form
the
idea
of
an
impression
and
of
an
idea
and
how
we
way
believe
the
existence
of
an
impression
and
of
an
idea
sect
ix
of
the
effects
of
other
relations
and
other
habits
however
convincing
the
foregoing
arguments
may
appear
we
must
not
rest
contented
with
them
but
must
turn
the
subject
on
every
side
in
order
to
find
some
new
points
of
view
from
which
we
may
illustrate
and
confirm
such
extraordinary
and
such
fundamental
principles
a
scrupulous
hesitation
to
receive
any
new
hypothesis
is
so
laudable
a
disposition
in
philosophers
and
so
necessary
to
the
examination
of
truth
that
it
deserves
to
be
complyed
with
and
requires
that
every
argument
be
produced
which
may
tend
to
their
satisfaction
and
every
objection
removed
which
may
stop
them
in
their
reasoning
i
have
often
observed
that
beside
cause
and
effect
the
two
relations
of
resemblance
and
contiguity
are
to
be
considered
as
associating
principles
of
thought
and
as
capable
of
conveying
the
imagination
from
one
idea
to
another
i
have
also
observed
that
when
of
two
objects
connected
by
any
of
these
relations
one
is
immediately
present
to
the
memory
or
senses
not
only
the
mind
is
conveyed
to
its
by
means
of
the
associating
principle
but
likewise
conceives
it
with
an
additional
force
and
vigour
by
the
united
operation
of
that
principle
and
of
the
present
impression
all
this
i
have
observed
in
order
to
confirm
by
analogy
my
explication
of
our
judgments
concerning
cause
and
effect
but
this
very
argument
may
perhaps
be
turned
against
me
and
instead
of
a
confirmation
of
my
hypothesis
may
become
an
objection
to
it
for
it
may
be
said
that
if
all
the
parts
of
that
hypothesis
be
true
viz
that
these
three
species
of
relation
are
derived
from
the
same
principles
that
their
effects
in
informing
and
enlivening
our
ideas
are
the
same
and
that
belief
is
nothing
but
a
more
forcible
and
vivid
conception
of
an
idea
it
should
follow
that
that
action
of
the
mind
may
not
only
be
derived
from
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
but
also
from
those
of
contiguity
and
resemblance
but
as
we
find
by
experience
that
belief
arises
only
from
causation
and
that
we
can
draw
no
inference
from
one
object
to
another
except
they
be
connected
by
this
relation
we
may
conclude
that
there
is
some
error
in
that
reasoning
which
leads
us
into
such
difficulties
this
is
the
objection
let
us
now
consider
its
solution
it
is
evident
that
whatever
is
present
to
the
memory
striking
upon
the
mind
with
a
vivacity
which
resembles
an
immediate
impression
must
become
of
considerable
moment
in
all
the
operations
of
the
mind
and
must
easily
distinguish
itself
above
the
mere
fictions
of
the
imagination
of
these
impressions
or
ideas
of
the
memory
we
form
a
kind
of
system
comprehending
whatever
we
remember
to
have
been
present
either
to
our
internal
perception
or
senses
and
every
particular
of
that
system
joined
to
the
present
impressions
we
are
pleased
to
call
a
reality
but
the
mind
stops
not
here
for
finding
that
with
this
system
of
perceptions
there
is
another
connected
by
custom
or
if
you
will
by
the
relation
of
cause
or
effect
it
proceeds
to
the
consideration
of
their
ideas
and
as
it
feels
that
it
is
in
a
manner
necessarily
determined
to
view
these
particular
ideas
and
that
the
custom
or
relation
by
which
it
is
determined
admits
not
of
the
least
change
it
forms
them
into
a
new
system
which
it
likewise
dignifies
with
the
title
of
realities
the
first
of
these
systems
is
the
object
of
the
memory
and
senses
the
second
of
the
judgment
it
is
this
latter
principle
which
peoples
the
world
and
brings
us
acquainted
with
such
existences
as
by
their
removal
in
time
and
place
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
the
senses
and
memory
by
means
of
it
i
paint
the
universe
in
my
imagination
and
fix
my
attention
on
any
part
of
it
i
please
i
form
an
idea
of
rome
which
i
neither
see
nor
remember
but
which
is
connected
with
such
impressions
as
i
remember
to
have
received
from
the
conversation
and
books
of
travellers
and
historians
this
idea
of
rome
i
place
in
a
certain
situation
on
the
idea
of
an
object
which
i
call
the
globe
i
join
to
it
the
conception
of
a
particular
government
and
religion
and
manners
i
look
backward
and
consider
its
first
foundation
its
several
revolutions
successes
and
misfortunes
all
this
and
everything
else
which
i
believe
are
nothing
but
ideas
though
by
their
force
and
settled
order
arising
from
custom
and
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
they
distinguish
themselves
from
the
other
ideas
which
are
merely
the
offspring
of
the
imagination
as
to
the
influence
of
contiguity
and
resemblance
we
may
observe
that
if
the
contiguous
and
resembling
object
be
comprehended
in
this
system
of
realities
there
is
no
doubt
but
these
two
relations
will
assist
that
of
cause
and
effect
and
infix
the
related
idea
with
more
force
in
the
imagination
this
i
shall
enlarge
upon
presently
mean
while
i
shall
carry
my
observation
a
step
farther
and
assert
that
even
where
the
related
object
is
but
feigned
the
relation
will
serve
to
enliven
the
idea
and
encrease
its
influence
a
poet
no
doubt
will
be
the
better
able
to
form
a
strong
description
of
the
elysian
fields
that
he
prompts
his
imagination
by
the
view
of
a
beautiful
meadow
or
garden
as
at
another
time
he
may
by
his
fancy
place
himself
in
the
midst
of
these
fabulous
regions
that
by
the
feigned
contiguity
he
may
enliven
his
imagination
but
though
i
can
not
altogether
exclude
the
relations
of
resemblance
and
contiguity
from
operating
on
the
fancy
in
this
manner
it
is
observable
that
when
single
their
influence
is
very
feeble
and
uncertain
as
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
is
requisite
to
persuade
us
of
any
real
existence
so
is
this
persuasion
requisite
to
give
force
to
these
other
relations
for
where
upon
the
appearance
of
an
impression
we
not
only
feign
another
object
but
likewise
arbitrarily
and
of
our
mere
and
pleasure
give
it
a
particular
relation
to
the
impression
this
can
have
but
a
small
effect
upon
the
mind
nor
is
there
any
reason
why
upon
the
return
of
the
same
impression
we
should
be
determined
to
place
the
same
object
in
the
same
relation
to
it
there
is
no
manner
of
necessity
for
the
mind
to
feign
any
resembling
and
contiguous
objects
and
if
it
feigns
such
there
is
as
little
necessity
for
it
always
to
confine
itself
to
the
same
without
any
difference
or
variation
and
indeed
such
a
fiction
is
founded
on
so
little
reason
that
nothing
but
pure
caprice
can
determine
the
mind
to
form
it
and
that
principle
being
fluctuating
and
uncertain
it
is
impossible
it
can
ever
operate
with
any
considerable
degree
of
force
and
constancy
the
mind
forsees
and
anticipates
the
change
and
even
from
the
very
first
instant
feels
the
looseness
of
its
actions
and
the
weak
hold
it
has
of
its
objects
and
as
this
imperfection
is
very
sensible
in
every
single
instance
it
still
encreases
by
experience
and
observation
when
we
compare
the
several
instances
we
may
remember
and
form
a
general
rule
against
the
reposing
any
assurance
in
those
momentary
glimpses
of
light
which
arise
in
the
imagination
from
a
feigned
resemblance
and
contiguity
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
has
all
the
opposite
advantages
the
objects
it
presents
are
fixt
and
unalterable
the
impressions
of
the
memory
never
change
in
any
considerable
degree
and
each
impression
draws
along
with
it
a
precise
idea
which
takes
its
place
in
the
imagination
as
something
solid
and
real
certain
and
invariable
the
thought
is
always
determined
to
pass
from
the
impression
to
the
idea
and
from
that
particular
impression
to
that
particular
idea
without
any
choice
or
hesitation
but
not
content
with
removing
this
objection
i
shall
endeavour
to
extract
from
it
a
proof
of
the
present
doctrine
contiguity
and
resemblance
have
an
effect
much
inferior
to
causation
but
still
have
some
effect
and
augment
the
conviction
of
any
opinion
and
the
vivacity
of
any
conception
if
this
can
be
proved
in
several
new
instances
beside
what
we
have
already
observed
it
will
be
allowed
no
inconsiderable
argument
that
belief
is
nothing
but
a
lively
idea
related
to
a
present
impression
to
begin
with
contiguity
it
has
been
remarked
among
the
mahometans
as
well
as
christians
that
those
pilgrims
who
have
seen
mecca
or
the
holy
land
are
ever
after
more
faithful
and
zealous
believers
than
those
who
have
not
had
that
advantage
a
man
whose
memory
presents
him
with
a
lively
image
of
the
and
the
desert
and
jerusalem
and
galilee
can
never
doubt
of
any
miraculous
events
which
are
related
either
by
moses
or
the
evangelists
the
lively
idea
of
the
places
passes
by
an
easy
transition
to
the
facts
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
related
to
them
by
contiguity
and
encreases
the
belief
by
encreasing
the
vivacity
of
the
conception
the
remembrance
of
these
fields
and
rivers
has
the
same
influence
on
the
vulgar
as
a
new
argument
and
from
the
same
causes
we
may
form
a
like
observation
concerning
resemblance
we
have
remarked
that
the
conclusion
which
we
draw
from
a
present
object
to
its
absent
cause
or
effect
is
never
founded
on
any
qualities
which
we
observe
in
that
object
considered
in
itself
or
in
other
words
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
otherwise
than
by
experience
what
will
result
from
any
phenomenon
or
what
has
preceded
it
but
though
this
be
so
evident
in
itself
that
it
seemed
not
to
require
any
proof
yet
some
philosophers
have
imagined
that
there
is
an
apparent
cause
for
the
communication
of
motion
and
that
a
reasonable
man
might
immediately
infer
the
motion
of
one
body
from
the
impulse
of
another
without
having
recourse
to
any
past
observation
that
this
opinion
is
false
will
admit
of
an
easy
proof
for
if
such
an
inference
may
be
drawn
merely
from
the
ideas
of
body
of
motion
and
of
impulse
it
must
amount
to
a
demonstration
and
must
imply
the
absolute
impossibility
of
any
contrary
supposition
every
effect
then
beside
the
communication
of
motion
implies
a
formal
contradiction
and
it
is
impossible
not
only
that
it
can
exist
but
also
that
it
can
be
conceived
but
we
may
soon
satisfy
ourselves
of
the
contrary
by
forming
a
clear
and
consistent
idea
of
one
body
moving
upon
another
and
of
its
rest
immediately
upon
the
contact
or
of
its
returning
back
in
the
same
line
in
which
it
came
or
of
its
annihilation
or
circular
or
elliptical
motion
and
in
short
of
an
infinite
number
of
other
changes
which
we
may
suppose
it
to
undergo
these
suppositions
are
all
consistent
and
natural
and
the
reason
why
we
imagine
the
communication
of
motion
to
be
more
consistent
and
natural
not
only
than
those
suppositions
but
also
than
any
other
natural
effect
is
founded
on
the
relation
of
resemblance
betwixt
the
cause
and
effect
which
is
here
united
to
experience
and
binds
the
objects
in
the
closest
and
most
intimate
manner
to
each
other
so
as
to
make
us
imagine
them
to
be
absolutely
inseparable
resemblance
then
has
the
same
or
a
parallel
influence
with
experience
and
as
the
only
immediate
effect
of
experience
is
to
associate
our
ideas
together
it
follows
that
all
belief
arises
from
the
association
of
ideas
according
to
my
hypothesis
it
is
universally
allowed
by
the
writers
on
optics
that
the
eye
at
all
times
sees
an
equal
number
of
physical
points
and
that
a
man
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
has
no
larger
an
image
presented
to
his
senses
than
when
he
is
cooped
up
in
the
narrowest
court
or
chamber
it
is
only
by
experience
that
he
infers
the
greatness
of
the
object
from
some
peculiar
qualities
of
the
image
and
this
inference
of
the
judgment
he
confounds
with
sensation
as
is
common
on
other
occasions
now
it
is
evident
that
the
inference
of
the
judgment
is
here
much
more
lively
than
what
is
usual
in
our
common
reasonings
and
that
a
man
has
a
more
vivid
conception
of
the
vast
extent
of
the
ocean
from
the
image
he
receives
by
the
eye
when
he
stands
on
the
top
of
the
high
promontory
than
merely
from
hearing
the
roaring
of
the
waters
he
feels
a
more
sensible
pleasure
from
its
magnificence
which
is
a
proof
of
a
more
lively
idea
and
he
confounds
his
judgment
with
sensation
which
is
another
proof
of
it
but
as
the
inference
is
equally
certain
and
immediate
in
both
cases
this
superior
vivacity
of
our
conception
in
one
case
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
this
that
in
drawing
an
inference
from
the
sight
beside
the
customary
conjunction
there
is
also
a
resemblance
betwixt
the
image
and
the
object
we
infer
which
strengthens
the
relation
and
conveys
the
vivacity
of
the
impression
to
the
related
idea
with
an
easier
and
more
natural
movement
no
weakness
of
human
nature
is
more
universal
and
conspicuous
than
what
we
commonly
call
credulity
or
a
too
easy
faith
in
the
testimony
of
others
and
this
weakness
is
also
very
naturally
accounted
for
from
the
influence
of
resemblance
when
we
receive
any
matter
of
fact
upon
human
testimony
our
faith
arises
from
the
very
same
origin
as
our
inferences
from
causes
to
effects
and
from
effects
to
causes
nor
is
there
anything
but
our
experience
of
the
governing
principles
of
human
nature
which
can
give
us
any
assurance
of
the
veracity
of
men
but
though
experience
be
the
true
standard
of
this
as
well
as
of
all
other
judgments
we
seldom
regulate
ourselves
entirely
by
it
but
have
a
remarkable
propensity
to
believe
whatever
is
reported
even
concerning
apparitions
enchantments
and
prodigies
however
contrary
to
daily
experience
and
observation
the
words
or
discourses
of
others
have
an
intimate
connexion
with
certain
ideas
in
their
mind
and
these
ideas
have
also
a
connexion
with
the
facts
or
objects
which
they
represent
this
latter
connexion
is
generally
much
and
commands
our
assent
beyond
what
experience
will
justify
which
can
proceed
from
nothing
beside
the
resemblance
betwixt
the
ideas
and
the
facts
other
effects
only
point
out
their
causes
in
an
oblique
manner
but
the
testimony
of
men
does
it
directly
and
is
to
be
considered
as
an
image
as
well
as
an
effect
no
wonder
therefore
we
are
so
rash
in
drawing
our
inferences
from
it
and
are
less
guided
by
experience
in
our
judgments
concerning
it
than
in
those
upon
any
other
subject
as
resemblance
when
conjoined
with
causation
fortifies
our
reasonings
so
the
want
of
it
in
any
very
great
degree
is
able
almost
entirely
to
destroy
them
of
this
there
is
a
remarkable
instance
in
the
universal
carelessness
and
stupidity
of
men
with
regard
to
a
future
state
where
they
show
as
obstinate
an
incredulity
as
they
do
a
blind
credulity
on
other
occasions
there
is
not
indeed
a
more
ample
matter
of
wonder
to
the
studious
and
of
regret
to
the
pious
man
than
to
observe
the
negligence
of
the
bulk
of
mankind
concerning
their
approaching
condition
and
it
is
with
reason
that
many
eminent
theologians
have
not
scrupled
to
affirm
that
though
the
vulgar
have
no
formal
principles
of
infidelity
yet
they
are
really
infidels
in
their
hearts
and
have
nothing
like
what
we
can
call
a
belief
of
the
eternal
duration
of
their
souls
for
let
us
consider
on
the
one
hand
what
divines
have
displayed
with
such
eloquence
concerning
the
importance
of
eternity
and
at
the
same
time
reflect
that
though
in
matters
of
rhetoric
we
ought
to
lay
our
account
with
some
exaggeration
we
must
in
this
case
allow
that
the
strongest
figures
are
infinitely
inferior
to
the
subject
and
after
this
let
us
view
on
the
other
hand
the
prodigious
security
of
men
in
this
particular
i
ask
if
these
people
really
believe
what
is
inculcated
on
them
and
what
they
pretend
to
affirm
and
the
answer
is
obviously
in
the
negative
as
belief
is
an
act
of
the
mind
arising
from
custom
it
is
not
strange
the
want
of
resemblance
should
overthrow
what
custom
has
established
and
diminish
the
force
of
the
idea
as
much
as
that
latter
principle
encreases
it
a
future
state
is
so
far
removed
from
our
comprehension
and
we
have
so
obscure
an
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
we
shall
exist
after
the
dissolution
of
the
body
that
all
the
reasons
we
can
invent
however
strong
in
themselves
and
however
much
assisted
by
education
are
never
able
with
slow
imaginations
to
surmount
this
difficulty
or
bestow
a
sufficient
authority
and
force
on
the
idea
i
rather
choose
to
ascribe
this
incredulity
to
the
faint
idea
we
form
of
our
future
condition
derived
from
its
want
of
resemblance
to
the
present
life
than
to
that
derived
from
its
remoteness
for
i
observe
that
men
are
everywhere
concerned
about
what
may
happen
after
their
death
provided
it
regard
this
world
and
that
there
are
few
to
whom
their
name
their
family
their
friends
and
their
country
are
in
any
period
of
time
entirely
indifferent
and
indeed
the
want
of
resemblance
in
this
case
so
entirely
destroys
belief
that
except
those
few
who
upon
cool
reflection
on
the
importance
of
the
subject
have
taken
care
by
repeated
meditation
to
imprint
in
their
minds
the
arguments
for
a
future
state
there
scarce
are
any
who
believe
the
immortality
of
the
soul
with
a
true
and
established
judgment
such
as
is
derived
from
the
testimony
of
travellers
and
historians
this
appears
very
conspicuously
wherever
men
have
occasion
to
compare
the
pleasures
and
pains
the
rewards
and
punishments
of
this
life
with
those
of
a
future
even
though
the
case
does
not
concern
themselves
and
there
is
no
violent
passion
to
disturb
their
judgment
the
roman
clatholicks
are
certainly
the
most
zealous
of
any
sect
in
the
christian
world
and
yet
you
find
few
among
the
more
sensible
people
of
that
communion
who
do
not
blame
the
and
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
as
cruel
and
barbarous
though
projected
or
executed
against
those
very
people
whom
without
any
scruple
they
condemn
to
eternal
and
infinite
punishments
all
we
can
say
in
excuse
for
this
inconsistency
is
that
they
really
do
not
believe
what
they
affirm
concerning
a
future
state
nor
is
there
any
better
proof
of
it
than
the
very
inconsistency
we
may
add
to
this
a
remark
that
in
matters
of
religion
men
take
a
pleasure
in
being
terrifyed
and
that
no
preachers
are
so
popular
as
those
who
excite
the
most
dismal
and
gloomy
passions
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
where
we
feel
and
are
penetrated
with
the
solidity
of
the
subject
nothing
can
be
more
disagreeable
than
fear
and
terror
and
it
is
only
in
dramatic
performances
and
in
religious
discourses
that
they
ever
give
pleasure
in
these
latter
cases
the
imagination
reposes
itself
indolently
on
the
idea
and
the
passion
being
softened
by
the
want
of
belief
in
the
subject
has
no
more
than
the
agreeable
effect
of
enlivening
the
mind
and
fixing
the
attention
the
present
hypothesis
will
receive
additional
confirmation
if
we
examine
the
effects
of
other
kinds
of
custom
as
well
as
of
other
relations
to
understand
this
we
must
consider
that
custom
to
which
i
attribute
all
belief
and
reasoning
may
operate
upon
the
mind
in
invigorating
an
idea
after
two
several
ways
for
supposing
that
in
all
past
experience
we
have
found
two
objects
to
have
been
always
conjoined
together
it
is
evident
that
upon
the
appearance
of
one
of
these
objects
in
an
impression
we
must
from
custom
make
an
easy
transition
to
the
idea
of
that
object
which
usually
attends
it
and
by
means
of
the
present
impression
and
easy
transition
must
conceive
that
idea
in
a
stronger
and
more
lively
manner
than
we
do
any
loose
floating
image
of
the
fancy
but
let
us
next
suppose
that
a
mere
idea
alone
without
any
of
this
curious
and
almost
artificial
preparation
should
frequently
make
its
appearance
in
the
mind
this
idea
must
by
degrees
acquire
a
facility
and
force
and
both
by
its
firm
hold
and
easy
introduction
distinguish
itself
from
any
new
and
unusual
idea
this
is
the
only
particular
in
which
these
two
kinds
of
custom
agree
and
if
it
appear
that
their
effects
on
the
judgment
are
similar
and
proportionable
we
may
certainly
conclude
that
the
foregoing
explication
of
that
faculty
is
satisfactory
but
can
we
doubt
of
this
agreement
in
their
influence
on
the
judgment
when
we
consider
the
nature
and
effects
of
education
all
those
opinions
and
notions
of
things
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
from
our
infancy
take
such
deep
root
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
by
all
the
powers
of
reason
and
experience
to
eradicate
them
and
this
habit
not
only
approaches
in
its
influence
but
even
on
many
occasions
prevails
over
that
which
from
the
constant
and
inseparable
union
of
causes
and
effects
here
we
most
not
be
contented
with
saying
that
the
vividness
of
the
idea
produces
the
belief
we
must
maintain
that
they
are
individually
the
same
the
frequent
repetition
of
any
idea
infixes
it
in
the
imagination
but
coued
never
possibly
of
itself
produce
belief
if
that
act
of
the
mind
was
by
the
original
constitution
of
our
natures
annexed
only
to
a
reasoning
and
comparison
of
ideas
custom
may
lead
us
into
some
false
comparison
of
ideas
this
is
the
utmost
effect
we
can
conceive
of
it
but
it
is
certain
it
coued
never
supply
the
place
of
that
comparison
nor
produce
any
act
of
the
mind
which
naturally
belonged
to
that
principle
a
person
that
has
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
by
amputation
endeavours
for
a
long
time
afterwards
to
serve
himself
with
them
after
the
death
of
any
one
it
is
a
common
remark
of
the
whole
family
but
especially
of
the
servants
that
they
can
scarce
believe
him
to
be
dead
but
still
imagine
him
to
be
in
his
chamber
or
in
any
other
place
where
they
were
accustomed
to
find
him
i
have
often
heard
in
conversation
after
talking
of
a
person
that
is
any
way
celebrated
that
one
who
has
no
acquaintance
with
him
will
say
i
have
never
seen
but
almost
fancy
i
have
so
often
have
i
heard
talk
of
him
all
these
are
parallel
instances
if
we
consider
this
argument
from
education
in
a
proper
light
it
will
appear
very
convincing
and
the
more
so
that
it
is
founded
on
one
of
the
most
common
phaenomena
that
is
any
where
to
be
met
with
i
am
persuaded
that
upon
examination
we
shall
find
more
than
one
half
of
those
opinions
that
prevail
among
mankind
to
be
owing
to
education
and
that
the
principles
which
are
thus
implicitely
embraced
overballance
those
which
are
owing
either
to
abstract
reasoning
or
experience
as
liars
by
the
frequent
repetition
of
their
lies
come
at
last
to
remember
them
so
the
judgment
or
rather
the
imagination
by
the
like
means
may
have
ideas
so
strongly
imprinted
on
it
and
conceive
them
in
so
full
a
light
that
they
may
operate
upon
the
mind
in
the
same
manner
with
those
which
the
senses
memory
or
reason
present
to
us
but
as
education
is
an
artificial
and
not
a
natural
cause
and
as
its
maxims
are
frequently
contrary
to
reason
and
even
to
themselves
in
different
times
and
places
it
is
never
upon
that
account
recognized
by
philosophers
though
in
reality
it
be
built
almost
on
the
same
foundation
of
custom
and
repetition
as
our
reasonings
from
causes
and
effects
footnote
in
general
we
may
observe
that
as
our
assent
to
all
probable
reasonings
is
founded
on
the
vivacity
of
ideas
it
resembles
many
of
those
whimsies
and
prejudices
which
are
rejected
under
the
opprobrious
character
of
being
the
offspring
of
the
imagination
by
this
expression
it
appears
that
the
word
imagination
is
commonly
usd
in
two
different
senses
and
tho
nothing
be
more
contrary
to
true
philosophy
than
this
inaccuracy
yet
in
the
following
reasonings
i
have
often
been
obligd
to
fall
into
it
when
i
oppose
the
imagination
to
the
memory
i
mean
the
faculty
by
which
we
form
our
fainter
ideas
when
i
oppose
it
to
reason
i
mean
the
same
faculty
excluding
only
our
demonstrative
and
probable
reasonings
when
i
oppose
it
to
neither
it
is
indifferent
whether
it
be
taken
in
the
larger
or
more
limited
sense
or
at
least
the
context
will
sufficiently
explain
the
meaning
sect
x
of
the
influence
of
belief
but
though
education
be
disclaimed
by
philosophy
as
a
fallacious
ground
of
assent
to
any
opinion
it
prevails
nevertheless
in
the
world
and
is
the
cause
why
all
systems
are
apt
to
be
rejected
at
first
as
new
and
unusual
this
perhaps
will
be
the
fate
of
what
i
have
here
advanced
concerning
belief
and
though
the
proofs
i
have
produced
appear
to
me
perfectly
conclusive
i
expect
not
to
make
many
proselytes
to
my
opinion
men
will
scarce
ever
be
persuaded
that
effects
of
such
consequence
can
flow
from
principles
which
are
seemingly
so
inconsiderable
and
that
the
far
greatest
part
of
our
reasonings
with
all
our
actions
and
passions
can
be
derived
from
nothing
but
custom
and
habit
to
obviate
this
objection
i
shall
here
anticipate
a
little
what
would
more
properly
fall
under
our
consideration
afterwards
when
we
come
to
treat
of
the
passions
and
the
sense
of
beauty
there
is
implanted
in
the
human
mind
a
perception
of
pain
and
pleasure
as
the
chief
spring
and
moving
principle
of
all
its
actions
but
pain
and
pleasure
have
two
ways
of
making
their
appearance
in
the
mind
of
which
the
one
has
effects
very
different
from
the
other
they
may
either
appear
in
impression
to
the
actual
feeling
or
only
in
idea
as
at
present
when
i
mention
them
it
is
evident
the
influence
of
these
upon
our
actions
is
far
from
being
equal
impressions
always
actuate
the
soul
and
that
in
the
highest
degree
but
it
is
not
every
idea
which
has
the
same
effect
nature
has
proceeded
with
caution
in
this
came
and
seems
to
have
carefully
avoided
the
inconveniences
of
two
extremes
did
impressions
alone
influence
the
will
we
should
every
moment
of
our
lives
be
subject
to
the
greatest
calamities
because
though
we
foresaw
their
approach
we
should
not
be
provided
by
nature
with
any
principle
of
action
which
might
impel
us
to
avoid
them
on
the
other
hand
did
every
idea
influence
our
actions
our
condition
would
not
be
much
mended
for
such
is
the
unsteadiness
and
activity
of
thought
that
the
images
of
every
thing
especially
of
goods
and
evils
are
always
wandering
in
the
mind
and
were
it
moved
by
every
idle
conception
of
this
kind
it
would
never
enjoy
a
moment
peace
and
tranquillity
nature
has
therefore
chosen
a
medium
and
has
neither
bestowed
on
every
idea
of
good
and
evil
the
power
of
actuating
the
will
nor
yet
has
entirely
excluded
them
from
this
influence
though
an
idle
fiction
has
no
efficacy
yet
we
find
by
experience
that
the
ideas
of
those
objects
which
we
believe
either
are
or
will
be
existent
produce
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
effect
with
those
impressions
which
are
immediately
present
to
the
senses
and
perception
the
effect
then
of
belief
is
to
raise
up
a
simple
idea
to
an
equality
with
our
impressions
and
bestow
on
it
a
like
influence
on
the
passions
this
effect
it
can
only
have
by
making
an
idea
approach
an
impression
in
force
and
vivacity
for
as
the
different
degrees
of
force
make
all
the
original
difference
betwixt
an
impression
and
an
idea
they
must
of
consequence
be
the
source
of
all
the
differences
in
the
effects
of
these
perceptions
and
their
removal
in
whole
or
in
part
the
cause
of
every
new
resemblance
they
acquire
wherever
we
can
make
an
idea
approach
the
impressions
in
force
and
vivacity
it
will
likewise
imitate
them
in
its
influence
on
the
mind
and
vice
versa
where
it
imitates
them
in
that
influence
as
in
the
present
case
this
must
proceed
from
its
approaching
them
in
force
and
vivacity
belief
therefore
since
it
causes
an
idea
to
imitate
the
effects
of
the
impressions
must
make
it
resemble
them
in
these
qualities
and
is
nothing
but
a
more
vivid
and
intense
conception
of
any
idea
this
then
may
both
serve
as
an
additional
argument
for
the
present
system
and
may
give
us
a
notion
after
what
manner
our
reasonings
from
causation
are
able
to
operate
on
the
will
and
passions
as
belief
is
almost
absolutely
requisite
to
the
exciting
our
passions
so
the
passions
in
their
turn
are
very
favourable
to
belief
and
not
only
such
facts
as
convey
agreeable
emotions
but
very
often
such
as
give
pain
do
upon
that
account
become
more
readily
the
objects
of
faith
and
opinion
a
coward
whose
fears
are
easily
awakened
readily
assents
to
every
account
of
danger
he
meets
with
as
a
person
of
a
sorrowful
and
melancholy
disposition
is
very
credulous
of
every
thing
that
nourishes
his
prevailing
passion
when
any
affecting
object
is
presented
it
gives
the
alarm
and
excites
immediately
a
degree
of
its
proper
passion
especially
in
persons
who
are
naturally
inclined
to
that
passion
this
emotion
passes
by
an
easy
transition
to
the
imagination
and
diffusing
itself
over
our
idea
of
the
affecting
object
makes
us
form
that
idea
with
greater
force
and
vivacity
and
consequently
assent
to
it
according
to
the
precedent
system
admiration
and
surprize
have
the
same
effect
as
the
other
passions
and
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
among
the
vulgar
quacks
and
projectors
meet
with
a
more
easy
faith
upon
account
of
their
magnificent
pretensions
than
if
they
kept
themselves
within
the
bounds
of
moderation
the
first
astonishment
which
naturally
attends
their
miraculous
relations
spreads
itself
over
the
whole
soul
and
so
vivifies
and
enlivens
the
idea
that
it
resembles
the
inferences
we
draw
from
experience
this
is
a
mystery
with
which
we
may
be
already
a
little
acquainted
and
which
we
shall
have
farther
occasion
to
be
let
into
in
the
progress
of
this
treatise
after
this
account
of
the
influence
of
belief
on
the
passions
we
shall
find
less
difficulty
in
explaining
its
effects
on
the
imagination
however
extraordinary
they
may
appear
it
is
certain
we
can
not
take
pleasure
in
any
discourse
where
our
judgment
gives
no
assent
to
those
images
which
are
presented
to
our
fancy
the
conversation
of
those
who
have
acquired
a
habit
of
lying
though
in
affairs
of
no
moment
never
gives
any
satisfaction
and
that
because
those
ideas
they
present
to
us
not
being
attended
with
belief
make
no
impression
upon
the
mind
poets
themselves
though
liars
by
profession
always
endeavour
to
give
an
air
of
truth
to
their
fictions
and
where
that
is
totally
neglected
their
performances
however
ingenious
will
never
be
able
to
afford
much
pleasure
in
short
we
may
observe
that
even
when
ideas
have
no
manner
of
influence
on
the
will
and
passions
truth
and
reality
are
still
requisite
in
order
to
make
them
entertaining
to
the
imagination
but
if
we
compare
together
all
the
phenomena
that
occur
on
this
head
we
shall
find
that
truth
however
necessary
it
may
seem
in
all
works
of
genius
has
no
other
effect
than
to
procure
an
easy
reception
for
the
ideas
and
to
make
the
mind
acquiesce
in
them
with
satisfaction
or
at
least
without
reluctance
but
as
this
is
an
effect
which
may
easily
be
supposed
to
flow
from
that
solidity
and
force
which
according
to
my
system
attend
those
ideas
that
are
established
by
reasonings
from
causation
it
follows
that
all
the
influence
of
belief
upon
the
fancy
may
be
explained
from
that
system
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
wherever
that
influence
arises
from
any
other
principles
beside
truth
or
reality
they
supply
its
place
and
give
an
equal
entertainment
to
the
imagination
poets
have
formed
what
they
call
a
poetical
system
of
things
which
though
it
be
believed
neither
by
themselves
nor
readers
is
commonly
esteemed
a
sufficient
foundation
for
any
fiction
we
have
been
so
much
accustomed
to
the
names
of
mars
jupiter
venus
that
in
the
same
manner
as
education
infixes
any
opinion
the
constant
repetition
of
these
ideas
makes
them
enter
into
the
mind
with
facility
and
prevail
upon
the
fancy
without
influencing
the
judgment
in
like
manner
tragedians
always
borrow
their
fable
or
at
least
the
names
of
their
principal
actors
from
some
known
passage
in
history
and
that
not
in
order
to
deceive
the
spectators
for
they
will
frankly
confess
that
truth
is
not
in
any
circumstance
inviolably
observed
but
in
order
to
procure
a
more
easy
reception
into
the
imagination
for
those
extraordinary
events
which
they
represent
but
this
is
a
precaution
which
is
not
required
of
comic
poets
whose
personages
and
incidents
being
of
a
more
familiar
kind
enter
easily
into
the
conception
and
are
received
without
any
such
formality
even
though
at
first
night
they
be
known
to
be
fictitious
and
the
pure
offspring
of
the
fancy
this
mixture
of
truth
and
falshood
in
the
fables
of
tragic
poets
not
only
serves
our
present
purpose
by
shewing
that
the
imagination
can
be
satisfyed
without
any
absolute
belief
or
assurance
but
may
in
another
view
be
regarded
as
a
very
strong
confirmation
of
this
system
it
is
evident
that
poets
make
use
of
this
artifice
of
borrowing
the
names
of
their
persons
and
the
chief
events
of
their
poems
from
history
in
order
to
procure
a
more
easy
reception
for
the
whole
and
cause
it
to
make
a
deeper
impression
on
the
fancy
and
affections
the
several
incidents
of
the
piece
acquire
a
kind
of
relation
by
being
united
into
one
poem
or
representation
and
if
any
of
these
incidents
be
an
object
of
belief
it
bestows
a
force
and
vivacity
on
the
others
which
are
related
to
it
the
vividness
of
the
first
conception
diffuses
itself
along
the
relations
and
is
conveyed
as
by
so
many
pipes
or
canals
to
every
idea
that
has
any
communication
with
the
primary
one
this
indeed
can
never
amount
to
a
perfect
assurance
and
that
because
the
union
among
the
ideas
is
in
a
manner
accidental
but
still
it
approaches
so
near
in
its
influence
as
may
convince
us
that
they
are
derived
from
the
same
origin
belief
must
please
the
imagination
by
means
of
the
force
and
vivacity
which
attends
it
since
every
idea
which
has
force
and
vivacity
is
found
to
be
agreeable
to
that
faculty
to
confirm
this
we
may
observe
that
the
assistance
is
mutual
betwixt
the
judgment
and
fancy
as
well
as
betwixt
the
judgment
and
passion
and
that
belief
not
only
gives
vigour
to
the
imagination
but
that
a
vigorous
and
strong
imagination
is
of
all
talents
the
most
proper
to
procure
belief
and
authority
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
withhold
our
assent
from
what
is
painted
out
to
us
in
all
the
colours
of
eloquence
and
the
vivacity
produced
by
the
fancy
is
in
many
cases
greater
than
that
which
arises
from
custom
and
experience
we
are
hurried
away
by
the
lively
imagination
of
our
author
or
companion
and
even
he
himself
is
often
a
victim
to
his
own
fire
and
genius
nor
will
it
be
amiss
to
remark
that
as
a
lively
imagination
very
often
degenerates
into
madness
or
folly
and
bears
it
a
great
resemblance
in
its
operations
so
they
influence
the
judgment
after
the
same
manner
and
produce
belief
from
the
very
same
principles
when
the
imagination
from
any
extraordinary
ferment
of
the
blood
and
spirits
acquires
such
a
vivacity
as
disorders
all
its
powers
and
faculties
there
is
no
means
of
distinguishing
betwixt
truth
and
falshood
but
every
loose
fiction
or
idea
having
the
same
influence
as
the
impressions
of
the
memory
or
the
conclusions
of
the
judgment
is
received
on
the
same
footing
and
operates
with
equal
force
on
the
passions
a
present
impression
and
a
customary
transition
are
now
no
longer
necessary
to
enliven
our
ideas
every
chimera
of
the
brain
is
as
vivid
and
intense
as
any
of
those
inferences
which
we
formerly
dignifyed
with
the
name
of
conclusions
concerning
matters
of
fact
and
sometimes
as
the
present
impressions
of
the
senses
we
may
observe
the
same
effect
of
poetry
in
a
lesser
degree
and
this
is
common
both
to
poetry
and
madness
that
the
vivacity
they
bestow
on
the
ideas
is
not
derived
from
the
particular
situations
or
connexions
of
the
objects
of
these
ideas
but
from
the
present
temper
and
disposition
of
the
person
but
how
great
soever
the
pitch
may
be
to
which
this
vivacity
rises
it
is
evident
that
in
poetry
it
never
has
the
same
feeling
with
that
which
arises
in
the
mind
when
we
reason
though
even
upon
the
lowest
species
of
probability
the
mind
can
easily
distinguish
betwixt
the
one
and
the
other
and
whatever
emotion
the
poetical
enthusiasm
may
give
to
the
spirits
it
is
still
the
mere
phantom
of
belief
or
persuasion
the
case
is
the
same
with
the
idea
as
with
the
passion
it
occasions
there
is
no
passion
of
the
human
mind
but
what
may
arise
from
poetry
though
at
the
same
time
the
feelings
of
the
passions
are
very
different
when
excited
by
poetical
fictions
from
what
they
are
when
they
are
from
belief
and
reality
a
passion
which
is
disagreeable
in
real
life
may
afford
the
highest
entertainment
in
a
tragedy
or
epic
poem
in
the
latter
case
it
lies
not
with
that
weight
upon
us
it
feels
less
firm
and
solid
and
has
no
other
than
the
agreeable
effect
of
exciting
the
spirits
and
rouzing
the
attention
the
difference
in
the
passions
is
a
clear
proof
of
a
like
difference
in
those
ideas
from
which
the
passions
are
derived
where
the
vivacity
arises
from
a
customary
conjunction
with
a
present
impression
though
the
imagination
may
not
in
appearance
be
so
much
moved
yet
there
is
always
something
more
forcible
and
real
in
its
actions
than
in
the
fervors
of
poetry
and
eloquence
the
force
of
our
mental
actions
in
this
case
no
more
than
in
any
other
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
apparent
agitation
of
the
mind
a
poetical
description
may
have
a
more
sensible
effect
on
the
fancy
than
an
historical
narration
it
may
collect
more
of
those
circumstances
that
form
a
compleat
image
or
picture
it
may
seem
to
set
the
object
before
us
in
more
lively
colours
but
still
the
ideas
it
presents
are
different
to
the
feeling
from
those
which
arise
from
the
memory
and
the
judgment
there
is
something
weak
and
imperfect
amidst
all
that
seeming
vehemence
of
thought
and
sentiment
which
attends
the
fictions
of
poetry
we
shall
afterwards
have
occasion
to
remark
both
the
resemblance
and
differences
betwixt
a
poetical
enthusiasm
and
a
serious
conviction
in
the
mean
time
i
can
not
forbear
observing
that
the
great
difference
in
their
feeling
proceeds
in
some
measure
from
reflection
and
general
rules
we
observe
that
the
vigour
of
conception
which
fictions
receive
from
poetry
and
eloquence
is
a
circumstance
merely
accidental
of
which
every
idea
is
equally
susceptible
and
that
such
fictions
are
connected
with
nothing
that
is
real
this
observation
makes
us
only
lend
ourselves
so
to
speak
to
the
fiction
but
causes
the
idea
to
feel
very
different
from
the
eternal
established
persuasions
founded
on
memory
and
custom
they
are
somewhat
of
the
same
kind
but
the
one
is
much
inferior
to
the
other
both
in
its
causes
and
effects
a
like
reflection
on
general
rules
keeps
us
from
augmenting
our
belief
upon
every
encrease
of
the
force
and
vivacity
of
our
ideas
where
an
opinion
admits
of
no
doubt
or
opposite
probability
we
attribute
to
it
a
full
conviction
though
the
want
of
resemblance
or
contiguity
may
render
its
force
inferior
to
that
of
other
opinions
it
is
thus
the
understanding
corrects
the
appearances
of
the
senses
and
makes
us
imagine
that
an
object
at
twenty
foot
distance
seems
even
to
the
eye
as
large
as
one
of
the
same
dimensions
at
ten
we
may
observe
the
same
effect
of
poetry
in
a
lesser
degree
only
with
this
difference
that
the
least
reflection
dissipates
the
illusions
of
poetry
and
places
the
objects
in
their
proper
light
it
is
however
certain
that
in
the
warmth
of
a
poetical
enthusiasm
a
poet
has
a
counterfeit
belief
and
even
a
kind
of
vision
of
his
objects
and
if
there
be
any
shadow
of
argument
to
support
this
belief
nothing
contributes
more
to
his
full
conviction
than
a
blaze
of
poetical
figures
and
images
which
have
their
effect
upon
the
poet
himself
as
well
as
upon
his
readers
sect
xi
of
the
probability
of
chances
but
in
order
to
bestow
on
this
system
its
full
force
and
evidence
we
must
carry
our
eye
from
it
a
moment
to
consider
its
consequences
and
explain
from
the
same
principles
some
other
species
of
reasoning
which
are
derived
from
the
same
origin
those
philosophers
who
have
divided
human
reason
into
knowledge
and
probability
and
have
defined
the
first
to
be
that
evidence
which
arises
from
the
comparison
of
ideas
are
obliged
to
comprehend
all
our
arguments
from
causes
or
effects
under
the
general
term
of
probability
but
though
every
one
be
free
to
use
his
terms
in
what
sense
he
pleases
and
accordingly
in
the
precedent
part
of
this
discourse
i
have
followed
this
method
of
expression
it
is
however
certain
that
in
common
discourse
we
readily
affirm
that
many
arguments
from
causation
exceed
probability
and
may
be
received
as
a
superior
kind
of
evidence
one
would
appear
ridiculous
who
would
say
that
it
is
only
probable
the
sun
will
rise
or
that
all
men
must
dye
though
it
is
plain
we
have
no
further
assurance
of
these
facts
than
what
experience
affords
us
for
this
reason
it
would
perhaps
be
more
convenient
in
order
at
once
to
preserve
the
common
signification
of
words
and
mark
the
several
degrees
of
evidence
to
distinguish
human
reason
into
three
kinds
viz
that
from
knowledge
from
proofs
and
from
probabilities
by
knowledge
i
mean
the
assurance
arising
from
the
comparison
of
ideas
by
proofs
those
arguments
which
are
derived
from
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
and
which
are
entirely
free
from
doubt
and
uncertainty
by
probability
that
evidence
which
is
still
attended
with
uncertainty
it
is
this
last
species
of
reasoning
i
proceed
to
examine
probability
or
reasoning
from
conjecture
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
viz
that
which
is
founded
on
chance
and
that
which
arises
from
causes
we
shall
consider
each
of
these
in
order
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
is
derived
from
experience
which
presenting
us
with
certain
objects
constantly
conjoined
with
each
other
produces
such
a
habit
of
surveying
them
in
that
relation
that
we
can
not
without
a
sensible
violence
survey
them
iii
any
other
on
the
other
hand
as
chance
is
nothing
real
in
itself
and
properly
speaking
is
merely
the
negation
of
a
cause
its
influence
on
the
mind
is
contrary
to
that
of
causation
and
it
is
essential
to
it
to
leave
the
imagination
perfectly
indifferent
either
to
consider
the
existence
or
of
that
object
which
is
regarded
as
contingent
a
cause
traces
the
way
to
our
thought
and
in
a
manner
forces
us
to
survey
such
certain
objects
in
such
certain
relations
chance
can
only
destroy
this
determination
of
the
thought
and
leave
the
mind
in
its
native
situation
of
indifference
in
which
upon
the
absence
of
a
cause
it
is
instantly
since
therefore
an
entire
indifference
is
essential
to
chance
no
one
chance
can
possibly
be
superior
to
another
otherwise
than
as
it
is
composed
of
a
superior
number
of
equal
chances
for
if
we
affirm
that
one
chance
can
after
any
other
manner
be
superior
to
another
we
must
at
the
same
time
affirm
that
there
is
something
which
gives
it
the
superiority
and
determines
the
event
rather
to
that
side
than
the
other
that
is
in
other
words
we
must
allow
of
a
cause
and
destroy
the
supposition
of
chance
which
we
had
before
established
a
perfect
and
total
indifference
is
essential
to
chance
and
one
total
indifference
can
never
in
itself
be
either
superior
or
inferior
to
another
this
truth
is
not
peculiar
to
my
system
but
is
acknowledged
by
every
one
that
forms
calculations
concerning
chances
and
here
it
is
remarkable
that
though
chance
and
causation
be
directly
contrary
yet
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
this
combination
of
chances
which
is
requisite
to
render
one
hazard
superior
to
another
without
supposing
a
mixture
of
causes
among
the
chances
and
a
conjunction
of
necessity
in
some
particulars
with
a
total
indifference
in
others
where
nothing
limits
the
chances
every
notion
that
the
most
extravagant
fancy
can
form
is
upon
a
footing
of
equality
nor
can
there
be
any
circumstance
to
give
one
the
advantage
above
another
thus
unless
we
allow
that
there
are
some
causes
to
make
the
dice
fall
and
preserve
their
form
in
their
fall
and
lie
upon
some
one
of
their
sides
we
can
form
no
calculation
concerning
the
laws
of
hazard
but
supposing
these
causes
to
operate
and
supposing
likewise
all
the
rest
to
be
indifferent
and
to
be
determined
by
chance
it
is
easy
to
arrive
at
a
notion
of
a
superior
combination
of
chances
a
dye
that
has
four
sides
marked
with
a
certain
number
of
spots
and
only
two
with
another
affords
us
an
obvious
and
easy
instance
of
this
superiority
the
mind
is
here
limited
by
the
causes
to
such
a
precise
number
and
quality
of
the
events
and
at
the
same
time
is
undetermined
in
its
choice
of
any
particular
event
proceeding
then
in
that
reasoning
wherein
we
have
advanced
three
steps
that
chance
is
merely
the
negation
of
a
cause
and
produces
a
total
indifference
in
the
mind
that
one
negation
of
a
cause
and
one
total
indifference
can
never
be
superior
or
inferior
to
another
and
that
there
must
always
be
a
mixture
of
causes
among
the
chances
in
order
to
be
the
foundation
of
any
reasoning
we
are
next
to
consider
what
effect
a
superior
combination
of
chances
can
have
upon
the
mind
and
after
what
manner
it
influences
our
judgment
and
opinion
here
we
may
repeat
all
the
same
arguments
we
employed
in
examining
that
belief
which
arises
from
causes
and
may
prove
after
the
same
manner
that
a
superior
number
of
chances
produces
our
assent
neither
by
demonstration
nor
probability
it
is
indeed
evident
that
we
can
never
by
the
comparison
of
mere
ideas
make
any
discovery
which
can
be
of
consequence
in
this
affairs
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
prove
with
certainty
that
any
event
must
fall
on
that
side
where
there
is
a
superior
number
of
chances
to
suppose
in
this
case
any
certainty
were
to
overthrow
what
we
have
established
concerning
the
opposition
of
chances
and
their
perfect
equality
and
indifference
should
it
be
said
that
though
in
an
opposition
of
chances
it
is
impossible
to
determine
with
certainty
on
which
side
the
event
will
fall
yet
we
can
pronounce
with
certainty
that
it
is
more
likely
and
probable
it
will
be
on
that
side
where
there
is
a
superior
number
of
chances
than
where
there
is
an
inferior
should
this
be
said
i
would
ask
what
is
here
meant
by
likelihood
and
probability
the
likelihood
and
probability
of
chances
is
a
superior
number
of
equal
chances
and
consequently
when
we
say
it
is
likely
the
event
win
fall
on
the
side
which
is
superior
rather
than
on
the
inferior
we
do
no
more
than
affirm
that
where
there
is
a
superior
number
of
chances
there
is
actually
a
superior
and
where
there
is
an
inferior
there
is
an
inferior
which
are
identical
propositions
and
of
no
consequence
the
question
is
by
what
means
a
superior
number
of
equal
chances
operates
upon
the
mind
and
produces
belief
or
assent
since
it
appears
that
it
is
neither
by
arguments
derived
from
demonstration
nor
from
probability
in
order
to
clear
up
this
difficulty
we
shall
suppose
a
person
to
take
a
dye
formed
after
such
a
manner
as
that
four
of
its
sides
are
marked
with
one
figure
or
one
number
of
spots
and
two
with
another
and
to
put
this
dye
into
the
box
with
an
intention
of
throwing
it
it
is
plain
he
must
conclude
the
one
figure
to
be
more
probable
than
the
other
and
give
the
preference
to
that
which
is
inscribed
on
the
greatest
number
of
sides
he
in
a
manner
believes
that
this
will
lie
uppermost
though
still
with
hesitation
and
doubt
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
chances
which
are
contrary
and
according
as
these
contrary
chances
diminish
and
the
superiority
encreases
on
the
other
side
his
belief
acquires
new
degrees
of
stability
and
assurance
this
belief
arises
from
an
operation
of
the
mind
upon
the
simple
and
limited
object
before
us
and
therefore
its
nature
will
be
the
more
easily
discovered
and
explained
we
have
nothing
but
one
single
dye
to
contemplate
in
order
to
comprehend
one
of
the
most
curious
operations
of
the
understanding
this
dye
formed
as
above
contains
three
circumstances
worthy
of
our
attention
first
certain
causes
such
as
gravity
solidity
a
cubical
figure
which
determine
it
to
fall
to
preserve
its
form
in
its
fall
and
to
turn
up
one
of
its
sides
secondly
a
certain
number
of
sides
which
are
supposed
indifferent
thirdly
a
certain
figure
inscribed
on
each
side
these
three
particulars
form
the
whole
nature
of
the
dye
so
far
as
relates
to
our
present
purpose
and
consequently
are
the
only
circumstances
regarded
by
the
mind
in
its
forming
a
judgment
concerning
the
result
of
such
a
throw
let
us
therefore
consider
gradually
and
carefully
what
must
be
the
influence
of
these
circumstances
on
the
thought
and
imagination
first
we
have
already
observed
that
the
mind
is
determined
by
custom
to
pass
from
any
cause
to
its
effect
and
that
upon
the
appearance
of
the
one
it
is
almost
impossible
for
it
not
to
form
an
idea
of
the
other
their
constant
conjunction
in
past
instances
has
produced
such
a
habit
in
the
mind
that
it
always
conjoins
them
in
its
thought
and
infers
the
existence
of
the
one
from
that
of
its
usual
attendant
when
it
considers
the
dye
as
no
longer
supported
by
the
box
it
can
not
without
violence
regard
it
as
suspended
in
the
air
but
naturally
places
it
on
the
table
and
views
it
as
turning
up
one
of
its
sides
this
is
the
effect
of
the
intermingled
causes
which
are
requisite
to
our
forming
any
calculation
concerning
chances
secondly
it
is
supposed
that
though
the
dye
be
necessarily
determined
to
fall
and
turn
up
one
of
its
sides
yet
there
is
nothing
to
fix
the
particular
side
but
that
this
is
determined
entirely
by
chance
the
very
nature
and
essence
of
chance
is
a
negation
of
causes
and
the
leaving
the
mind
in
a
perfect
indifference
among
those
events
which
are
supposed
contingent
when
therefore
the
thought
is
determined
by
the
causes
to
consider
the
dye
as
falling
and
turning
up
one
of
its
sides
the
chances
present
all
these
sides
as
equal
and
make
us
consider
every
one
of
them
one
after
another
as
alike
probable
and
possible
the
imagination
passes
from
the
cause
viz
the
throwing
of
the
dye
to
the
effect
viz
the
turning
up
one
of
the
six
sides
and
feels
a
kind
of
impossibility
both
of
stopping
short
in
the
way
and
of
forming
any
other
idea
but
as
all
these
six
sides
are
incompatible
and
the
dye
can
not
turn
up
above
one
at
once
this
principle
directs
us
not
to
consider
all
of
them
at
once
as
lying
uppermost
which
we
look
upon
as
impossible
neither
does
it
direct
us
with
its
entire
force
to
any
particular
side
for
in
that
case
this
side
would
be
considered
as
certain
and
inevitable
but
it
directs
us
to
the
whole
six
sides
after
such
a
manner
as
to
divide
its
force
equally
among
them
we
conclude
in
general
that
some
one
of
them
must
result
from
the
throw
we
run
all
of
them
over
in
our
minds
the
determination
of
the
thought
is
common
to
all
but
no
more
of
its
force
falls
to
the
share
of
any
one
than
what
is
suitable
to
its
proportion
with
the
rest
it
is
after
this
manner
the
original
impulse
and
consequently
the
vivacity
of
thought
arising
from
the
causes
is
divided
and
split
in
pieces
by
the
intermingled
chances
we
have
already
seen
the
influence
of
the
two
first
qualities
of
the
dye
viz
the
causes
and
the
number
and
indifference
of
the
sides
and
have
learned
how
they
give
an
impulse
to
the
thought
and
divide
that
impulse
into
as
many
parts
as
there
are
unites
in
the
number
of
sides
we
must
now
consider
the
effects
of
the
third
particular
viz
the
figures
inscribed
on
each
side
it
is
evident
that
where
several
sides
have
the
same
figure
inscribe
on
them
they
must
concur
in
their
influence
on
the
mind
and
must
unite
upon
one
image
or
idea
of
a
figure
all
those
divided
impulses
that
were
dispersed
over
the
several
sides
upon
which
that
figure
is
inscribed
were
the
question
only
what
side
will
be
turned
up
these
are
all
perfectly
equal
and
no
one
coued
ever
have
any
advantage
above
another
but
as
the
question
is
concerning
the
figure
and
as
the
same
figure
is
presented
by
more
than
one
side
it
is
evident
that
the
impulses
belonging
to
all
these
sides
must
in
that
one
figure
and
become
stronger
and
more
forcible
by
the
union
four
sides
are
supposed
in
the
present
case
to
have
the
same
figure
inscribed
on
them
and
two
to
have
another
figure
the
impulses
of
the
former
are
therefore
superior
to
those
of
the
latter
but
as
the
events
are
contrary
and
it
is
impossible
both
these
figures
can
be
turned
up
the
impulses
likewise
become
contrary
and
the
inferior
destroys
the
superior
as
far
as
its
strength
goes
the
vivacity
of
the
idea
is
always
proportionable
to
the
degrees
of
the
impulse
or
tendency
to
the
transition
and
belief
is
the
same
with
the
vivacity
of
the
idea
according
to
the
precedent
doctrine
sect
xii
of
the
probability
of
causes
what
i
have
said
concerning
the
probability
of
chances
can
serve
to
no
other
purpose
than
to
assist
us
in
explaining
the
probability
of
causes
since
it
is
commonly
allowed
by
philosophers
that
what
the
vulgar
call
chance
is
nothing
but
a
secret
and
concealed
cause
that
species
of
probability
therefore
is
what
we
must
chiefly
examine
the
probabilities
of
causes
are
of
several
kinds
but
are
all
derived
from
the
same
origin
viz
the
association
of
ideas
to
a
present
impression
as
the
habit
which
produces
the
association
arises
from
the
frequent
conjunction
of
objects
it
must
arrive
at
its
perfection
by
degrees
and
must
acquire
new
force
from
each
instance
that
falls
under
our
observation
the
first
instance
has
little
or
no
force
the
second
makes
some
addition
to
it
the
third
becomes
still
more
sensible
and
it
is
by
these
slow
steps
that
our
judgment
arrives
at
a
full
assurance
but
before
it
attains
this
pitch
of
perfection
it
passes
through
several
inferior
degrees
and
in
all
of
them
is
only
to
be
esteemed
a
presumption
or
probability
the
gradation
therefore
from
probabilities
to
proofs
is
in
many
cases
insensible
and
the
difference
betwixt
these
kinds
of
evidence
is
more
easily
perceived
in
the
remote
degrees
than
in
the
near
and
contiguous
it
is
worthy
of
remark
on
this
occasion
that
though
the
species
of
probability
here
explained
be
the
first
in
order
and
naturally
takes
place
before
any
entire
proof
can
exist
yet
no
one
who
is
arrived
at
the
age
of
maturity
can
any
longer
be
acquainted
with
it
it
is
true
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
people
of
the
most
advanced
knowledge
to
have
attained
only
an
imperfect
experience
of
many
particular
events
which
naturally
produces
only
an
imperfect
habit
and
transition
but
then
we
must
consider
that
the
mind
having
formed
another
observation
concerning
the
connexion
of
causes
and
effects
gives
new
force
to
its
reasoning
from
that
observation
and
by
means
of
it
can
build
an
argument
on
one
single
experiment
when
duly
prepared
and
examined
what
we
have
found
once
to
follow
from
any
object
we
conclude
will
for
ever
follow
from
it
and
if
this
maxim
be
not
always
built
upon
as
certain
it
is
not
for
want
of
a
sufficient
number
of
experiments
but
because
we
frequently
meet
with
instances
to
the
contrary
which
leads
us
to
the
second
species
of
probability
where
there
is
a
contrariety
in
our
experience
and
observation
it
would
be
very
happy
for
men
in
the
conduct
of
their
lives
and
actions
were
the
same
objects
always
conjoined
together
and
we
had
nothing
to
fear
but
the
mistakes
of
our
own
judgment
without
having
any
reason
to
apprehend
the
uncertainty
of
nature
but
as
it
is
frequently
found
that
one
observation
is
contrary
to
another
and
that
causes
and
effects
follow
not
in
the
same
order
of
which
we
have
i
had
experience
we
are
obliged
to
vary
our
reasoning
on
account
of
this
uncertainty
and
take
into
consideration
the
contrariety
of
events
the
first
question
that
occurs
on
this
head
is
concerning
the
nature
and
causes
of
the
contrariety
the
vulgar
who
take
things
according
to
their
first
appearance
attribute
the
uncertainty
of
events
to
such
an
uncertainty
in
the
causes
as
makes
them
often
fail
of
their
usual
influence
though
they
meet
with
no
obstacle
nor
impediment
in
their
operation
but
philosophers
observing
that
almost
in
every
part
of
nature
there
is
contained
a
vast
variety
of
springs
and
principles
which
are
hid
by
reason
of
their
minuteness
or
remoteness
find
that
it
is
at
least
possible
the
contrariety
of
events
may
not
proceed
from
any
contingency
in
the
cause
but
from
the
secret
operation
of
contrary
causes
this
possibility
is
converted
into
certainty
by
farther
observation
when
they
remark
that
upon
an
exact
scrutiny
a
contrariety
of
effects
always
betrays
a
contrariety
of
causes
and
proceeds
from
their
mutual
hindrance
and
opposition
a
peasant
can
give
no
better
reason
for
the
stopping
of
any
clock
or
watch
than
to
say
that
commonly
it
does
not
go
right
but
an
artizan
easily
perceives
that
the
same
force
in
the
spring
or
pendulum
has
always
the
same
influence
on
the
wheels
but
fails
of
its
usual
effect
perhaps
by
reason
of
a
grain
of
dust
which
puts
a
stop
to
the
whole
movement
from
the
observation
of
several
parallel
instances
philosophers
form
a
maxim
that
the
connexion
betwixt
all
causes
and
effects
is
equally
necessary
and
that
its
seeming
uncertainty
in
some
instances
proceeds
from
the
secret
opposition
of
contrary
causes
but
however
philosophers
and
the
vulgar
may
differ
in
their
explication
of
the
contrariety
of
events
their
inferences
from
it
are
always
of
the
same
kind
and
founded
on
the
same
principles
a
contrariety
of
events
in
the
past
may
give
us
a
kind
of
hesitating
belief
for
the
future
after
two
several
ways
first
by
producing
an
imperfect
habit
and
transition
from
the
present
impression
to
the
related
idea
when
the
conjunction
of
any
two
objects
is
frequent
without
being
entirely
constant
the
mind
is
determined
to
pass
from
one
object
to
the
other
but
not
with
so
entire
a
habit
as
when
the
union
is
uninterrupted
and
all
the
instances
we
have
ever
met
with
are
uniform
and
of
a
we
find
from
common
experience
in
our
actions
as
well
as
reasonings
that
a
constant
perseverance
in
any
course
of
life
produces
a
strong
inclination
and
tendency
to
continue
for
the
future
though
there
are
habits
of
inferior
degrees
of
force
proportioned
to
the
inferior
degrees
of
steadiness
and
uniformity
in
our
conduct
there
is
no
doubt
but
this
principle
sometimes
takes
place
and
produces
those
inferences
we
draw
from
contrary
phaenomena
though
i
am
perswaded
that
upon
examination
we
shall
not
find
it
to
be
the
principle
that
most
commonly
influences
the
mind
in
this
species
of
reasoning
when
we
follow
only
the
habitual
determination
of
the
mind
we
make
the
transition
without
any
reflection
and
interpose
not
a
moment
delay
betwixt
the
view
of
one
object
and
the
belief
of
that
which
is
often
found
to
attend
it
as
the
custom
depends
not
upon
any
deliberation
it
operates
immediately
without
allowing
any
time
for
reflection
but
this
method
of
proceeding
we
have
but
few
instances
of
in
our
probable
reasonings
and
even
fewer
than
in
those
which
are
derived
from
the
uninterrupted
conjunction
of
objects
in
the
former
species
of
reasoning
we
commonly
take
knowingly
into
consideration
the
contrariety
of
past
events
we
compare
the
different
sides
of
the
contrariety
and
carefully
weigh
the
experiments
which
we
have
on
each
side
whence
we
may
conclude
that
our
reasonings
of
this
kind
arise
not
directly
from
the
habit
but
in
an
oblique
manner
which
we
must
now
endeavour
to
explain
it
is
evident
that
when
an
object
is
attended
with
contrary
effects
we
judge
of
them
only
by
our
past
experience
and
always
consider
those
as
possible
which
we
have
observed
to
follow
from
it
and
as
past
experience
regulates
our
judgment
concerning
the
possibility
of
these
effects
so
it
does
that
concerning
their
probability
and
that
effect
which
has
been
the
most
common
we
always
esteem
the
most
likely
here
then
are
two
things
to
be
considered
viz
the
reasons
which
determine
us
to
make
the
past
a
standard
for
the
future
and
the
manner
how
we
extract
a
single
judgment
from
a
contrariety
of
past
events
first
we
may
observe
that
the
supposition
that
the
future
resembles
the
past
is
not
founded
on
arguments
of
any
kind
but
is
derived
entirely
from
habit
by
which
we
are
determined
to
expect
for
the
future
the
same
train
of
objects
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
this
habit
or
determination
to
transfer
the
past
to
the
future
is
full
and
perfect
and
consequently
the
first
impulse
of
the
imagination
in
this
species
of
reasoning
is
endowed
with
the
same
qualities
but
secondly
when
in
considering
past
experiments
we
find
them
of
a
contrary
nature
this
determination
though
full
and
perfect
in
itself
presents
us
with
no
steady
object
but
offers
us
a
number
of
disagreeing
images
in
a
certain
order
and
proportion
the
first
impulse
therefore
is
here
broke
into
pieces
and
diffuses
itself
over
all
those
images
of
which
each
partakes
an
equal
share
of
that
force
and
vivacity
that
is
derived
from
the
impulse
any
of
these
past
events
may
again
happen
and
we
judge
that
when
they
do
happen
they
will
be
mixed
in
the
same
proportion
as
in
the
past
if
our
intention
therefore
be
to
consider
the
proportions
of
contrary
events
in
a
great
number
of
instances
the
images
presented
by
our
past
experience
must
remain
in
their
first
form
and
preserve
their
first
proportions
suppose
for
instance
i
have
found
by
long
observation
that
of
twenty
ships
which
go
to
sea
only
nineteen
return
suppose
i
see
at
present
twenty
ships
that
leave
the
port
i
transfer
my
past
experience
to
the
future
and
represent
to
myself
nineteen
of
these
ships
as
returning
in
safety
and
one
as
perishing
concerning
this
there
can
be
no
difficulty
but
as
we
frequently
run
over
those
several
ideas
of
past
events
in
order
to
form
a
judgment
concerning
one
single
event
which
appears
uncertain
this
consideration
must
change
the
first
form
of
our
ideas
and
draw
together
the
divided
images
presented
by
experience
since
it
is
to
it
we
refer
the
determination
of
that
particular
event
upon
which
we
reason
many
of
these
images
are
supposed
to
concur
and
a
superior
number
to
concur
on
one
side
these
agreeing
images
unite
together
and
render
the
idea
more
strong
and
lively
not
only
than
a
mere
fiction
of
the
imagination
but
also
than
any
idea
which
is
supported
by
a
lesser
number
of
experiments
each
new
experiment
is
as
a
new
stroke
of
the
pencil
which
bestows
an
additional
vivacity
on
the
colours
without
either
multiplying
or
enlarging
the
figure
this
operation
of
the
mind
has
been
so
fully
explained
in
treating
of
the
probability
of
chance
that
i
need
not
here
endeavour
to
render
it
more
intelligible
every
past
experiment
may
be
considered
as
a
kind
of
chance
i
it
being
uncertain
to
us
whether
the
object
will
exist
conformable
to
one
experiment
or
another
and
for
this
reason
every
thing
that
has
been
said
on
the
one
subject
is
applicable
to
both
thus
upon
the
whole
contrary
experiments
produce
an
imperfect
belief
either
by
weakening
the
habit
or
by
dividing
and
afterwards
joining
in
different
parts
that
perfect
habit
which
makes
us
conclude
in
general
that
instances
of
which
we
have
no
experience
must
necessarily
resemble
those
of
which
we
have
to
justify
still
farther
this
account
of
the
second
species
of
probability
where
we
reason
with
knowledge
and
reflection
from
a
contrariety
of
past
experiments
i
shall
propose
the
following
considerations
without
fearing
to
give
offence
by
that
air
of
subtilty
which
attends
them
just
reasoning
ought
still
perhaps
to
retain
its
force
however
subtile
in
the
same
manner
as
matter
preserves
its
solidity
in
the
air
and
fire
and
animal
spirits
as
well
as
in
the
grosser
and
more
sensible
forms
first
we
may
observe
that
there
is
no
probability
so
great
as
not
to
allow
of
a
contrary
possibility
because
otherwise
it
would
cease
to
be
a
probability
and
would
become
a
certainty
that
probability
of
causes
which
is
most
extensive
and
which
we
at
present
examine
depends
on
a
contrariety
of
experiments
and
it
is
evident
an
experiment
in
the
past
proves
at
least
a
possibility
for
the
future
secondly
the
component
parts
of
this
possibility
and
probability
are
of
the
same
nature
and
differ
in
number
only
but
not
in
kind
it
has
been
observed
that
all
single
chances
are
entirely
equal
and
that
the
only
circumstance
which
can
give
any
event
that
is
contingent
a
superiority
over
another
is
a
superior
number
of
chances
in
like
manner
as
the
uncertainty
of
causes
is
discovery
by
experience
which
presents
us
with
a
view
of
contrary
events
it
is
plain
that
when
we
transfer
the
past
to
the
future
the
known
to
the
unknown
every
past
experiment
has
the
same
weight
and
that
it
is
only
a
superior
number
of
them
which
can
throw
the
ballance
on
any
side
the
possibility
therefore
which
enters
into
every
reasoning
of
this
kind
is
composed
of
parts
which
are
of
the
same
nature
both
among
themselves
and
with
those
that
compose
the
opposite
probability
thirdly
we
may
establish
it
as
a
certain
maxim
that
in
all
moral
as
well
as
natural
phaenomena
wherever
any
cause
consists
of
a
number
of
parts
and
the
effect
encreases
or
diminishes
according
to
the
variation
of
that
number
the
effects
properly
speaking
is
a
compounded
one
and
arises
from
the
union
of
the
several
effects
that
proceed
from
each
part
of
the
cause
thus
because
the
gravity
of
a
body
encreases
or
diminishes
by
the
encrease
or
diminution
of
its
parts
we
conclude
that
each
part
contains
this
quality
and
contributes
to
the
gravity
of
the
whole
the
absence
or
presence
of
a
part
of
the
cause
is
attended
with
that
of
a
proportionable
part
of
the
effect
this
connexion
or
constant
conjunction
sufficiently
proves
the
one
part
to
be
the
cause
of
the
other
as
the
belief
which
we
have
of
any
event
encreases
or
diminishes
according
to
the
number
of
chances
or
past
experiments
it
is
to
be
considered
as
a
compounded
effect
of
which
each
part
arises
from
a
proportionable
number
of
chances
or
experiments
let
us
now
join
these
three
observations
and
see
what
conclusion
we
can
draw
from
them
to
every
probability
there
is
an
opposite
possibility
this
possibility
is
composed
of
parts
that
are
entirely
of
the
same
nature
with
those
of
the
probability
and
consequently
have
the
same
influence
on
the
mind
and
understanding
the
belief
which
attends
the
probability
is
a
compounded
effect
and
is
formed
by
the
concurrence
of
the
several
effects
which
proceed
from
each
part
of
the
probability
since
therefore
each
part
of
the
probability
contributes
to
the
production
of
the
belief
each
part
of
the
possibility
must
have
the
same
influence
on
the
opposite
side
the
nature
of
these
parts
being
entirely
the
same
the
contrary
belief
attending
the
possibility
implies
a
view
of
a
certain
object
as
well
as
the
probability
does
an
opposite
view
in
this
particular
both
these
degrees
of
belief
are
alike
the
only
manner
then
in
which
the
superior
number
of
similar
component
parts
in
the
one
can
exert
its
influence
and
prevail
above
the
inferior
in
the
other
is
by
producing
a
stronger
and
more
lively
view
of
its
object
each
part
presents
a
particular
view
and
all
these
views
uniting
together
produce
one
general
view
which
is
fuller
and
more
distinct
by
the
greater
number
of
causes
or
principles
from
which
it
is
derived
the
component
parts
of
the
probability
and
possibility
being
alike
in
their
nature
must
produce
like
effects
and
the
likeness
of
their
effects
consists
in
this
that
each
of
them
presents
a
view
of
a
particular
object
but
though
these
parts
be
alike
in
their
nature
they
are
very
different
in
their
quantity
and
number
and
this
difference
must
appear
in
the
effect
as
well
as
the
similarity
now
as
the
view
they
present
is
in
both
cases
full
and
entire
and
comprehends
the
object
in
all
its
parts
it
is
impossible
that
in
this
particular
there
can
be
any
difference
nor
is
there
any
thing
but
a
superior
vivacity
in
the
probability
arising
from
the
concurrence
of
a
superior
number
of
views
which
can
distinguish
these
effects
here
is
almost
the
same
argument
in
a
different
light
all
our
reasonings
concerning
the
probability
of
causes
are
founded
on
the
transferring
of
past
to
future
the
transferring
of
any
past
experiment
to
the
future
is
sufficient
to
give
us
a
view
of
the
object
whether
that
experiment
be
single
or
combined
with
others
of
the
same
kind
whether
it
be
entire
or
opposed
by
others
of
a
contrary
kind
suppose
then
it
acquires
both
these
qualities
of
combination
and
opposition
it
loses
not
upon
that
account
its
former
power
of
presenting
a
view
of
the
object
but
only
concurs
with
and
opposes
other
experiments
that
have
a
like
influence
a
question
therefore
may
arise
concerning
the
manner
both
of
the
concurrence
and
opposition
as
to
the
concurrence
there
is
only
the
choice
left
betwixt
these
two
hypotheses
first
that
the
view
of
the
object
occasioned
by
the
transference
of
each
past
experiment
preserves
itself
entire
and
only
multiplies
the
number
of
views
or
secondly
that
it
runs
into
the
other
similar
and
correspondent
views
and
gives
them
a
superior
degree
of
force
and
vivacity
but
that
the
first
hypothesis
is
erroneous
is
evident
from
experience
which
informs
us
that
the
belief
attending
any
reasoning
consists
in
one
conclusion
not
in
a
multitude
of
similar
ones
which
would
only
distract
the
mind
and
in
many
cases
would
be
too
numerous
to
be
comprehended
distinctly
by
any
finite
capacity
it
remains
therefore
as
the
only
reasonable
opinion
that
these
similar
views
run
into
each
other
and
unite
their
forces
so
as
to
produce
a
stronger
and
clearer
view
than
what
arises
from
any
one
alone
this
is
the
manner
in
which
past
experiments
concur
when
they
are
transfered
to
any
future
event
as
to
the
manner
of
their
opposition
it
is
evident
that
as
the
contrary
views
are
incompatible
with
each
other
and
it
is
impossible
the
object
can
at
once
exist
conformable
to
both
of
them
their
influence
becomes
mutually
destructive
and
the
mind
is
determined
to
the
superior
only
with
that
force
which
remains
after
subtracting
the
inferior
i
am
sensible
how
abstruse
all
this
reasoning
must
appear
to
the
generality
of
readers
who
not
being
accustomed
to
such
profound
reflections
on
the
intellectual
faculties
of
the
mind
will
be
apt
to
reject
as
chimerical
whatever
strikes
not
in
with
the
common
received
notions
and
with
the
easiest
and
most
obvious
principles
of
philosophy
and
no
doubt
there
are
some
pains
required
to
enter
into
these
arguments
though
perhaps
very
little
are
necessary
to
perceive
the
imperfection
of
every
vulgar
hypothesis
on
this
subject
and
the
little
light
which
philosophy
can
yet
afford
us
in
such
sublime
and
such
curious
speculations
let
men
be
once
fully
perswaded
of
these
two
principles
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
object
considered
in
itself
which
can
afford
us
a
reason
for
drawing
a
conclusion
beyond
it
and
that
even
after
the
observation
of
the
frequent
or
constant
conjunction
of
objects
we
have
no
reason
to
draw
any
inference
concerning
any
object
beyond
those
of
which
we
have
had
experience
i
say
let
men
be
once
fully
convinced
of
these
two
principles
and
this
will
throw
them
so
loose
from
all
common
systems
that
they
will
make
no
difficulty
of
receiving
any
which
may
appear
the
most
extraordinary
these
principles
we
have
found
to
be
sufficiently
convincing
even
with
regard
to
our
most
certain
reasonings
from
causation
but
i
shall
venture
to
affirm
that
with
regard
to
these
conjectural
or
probable
reasonings
they
still
acquire
a
new
degree
of
evidence
first
it
is
obvious
that
in
reasonings
of
this
kind
it
is
not
the
object
presented
to
us
which
considered
in
itself
affords
us
any
reason
to
draw
a
conclusion
concerning
any
other
object
or
event
for
as
this
latter
object
is
supposed
uncertain
and
as
the
uncertainty
is
derived
from
a
concealed
contrariety
of
causes
in
the
former
were
any
of
the
causes
placed
in
the
known
qualities
of
that
object
they
would
no
longer
be
concealed
nor
would
our
conclusion
be
uncertain
but
secondly
it
is
equally
obvious
in
this
species
of
reasoning
that
if
the
transference
of
the
past
to
the
future
were
founded
merely
on
a
conclusion
of
the
understanding
it
coued
never
occasion
any
belief
or
assurance
when
we
transfer
contrary
experiments
to
the
future
we
can
only
repeat
these
contrary
experiments
with
their
particular
proportions
which
coued
not
produce
assurance
in
any
single
event
upon
which
we
reason
unless
the
fancy
melted
together
all
those
images
that
concur
and
extracted
from
them
one
single
idea
or
image
which
is
intense
and
lively
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
experiments
from
which
it
is
derived
and
their
superiority
above
their
antagonists
our
past
experience
presents
no
determinate
object
and
as
our
belief
however
faint
fixes
itself
on
a
determinate
object
it
is
evident
that
the
belief
arises
not
merely
from
the
transference
of
past
to
future
but
from
some
operation
of
the
fancy
conjoined
with
it
this
may
lead
us
to
conceive
the
manner
in
which
that
faculty
enters
into
all
our
reasonings
i
shall
conclude
this
subject
with
two
reflections
which
may
deserve
our
attention
the
first
may
be
explained
after
this
manner
when
the
mind
forms
a
reasoning
concerning
any
matter
of
fact
which
is
only
probable
it
casts
its
eye
backward
upon
past
experience
and
transferring
it
to
the
future
is
presented
with
so
many
contrary
views
of
its
object
of
which
those
that
are
of
the
same
kind
uniting
together
and
running
into
one
act
of
the
mind
serve
to
fortify
and
inliven
it
but
suppose
that
this
multitude
of
views
or
glimpses
of
an
object
proceeds
not
from
experience
but
from
a
voluntary
act
of
the
imagination
this
effect
does
not
follow
or
at
least
follows
not
in
the
same
degree
for
though
custom
and
education
produce
belief
by
such
a
repetition
as
is
not
derived
from
experience
yet
this
requires
a
long
tract
of
time
along
with
a
very
frequent
and
undesigned
repetition
in
general
we
may
pronounce
that
a
person
who
would
voluntarily
repeat
any
idea
in
his
mind
though
supported
by
one
past
experience
would
be
no
more
inclined
to
believe
the
existence
of
its
object
than
if
he
had
contented
himself
with
one
survey
of
it
beside
the
effect
of
design
each
act
of
the
mind
being
separate
and
independent
has
a
separate
influence
and
joins
not
its
force
with
that
of
its
fellows
not
being
united
by
any
common
object
producing
them
they
have
no
relation
to
each
other
and
consequently
make
no
transition
or
union
of
forces
this
phaenomenon
we
shall
understand
better
afterwards
my
second
reflection
is
founded
on
those
large
probabilities
which
the
mind
can
judge
of
and
the
minute
differences
it
can
observe
betwixt
them
when
the
chances
or
experiments
on
one
side
amount
to
ten
thousand
and
on
the
other
to
ten
thousand
and
one
the
judgment
gives
the
preference
to
the
latter
upon
account
of
that
superiority
though
it
is
plainly
impossible
for
the
mind
to
run
over
every
particular
view
and
distinguish
the
superior
vivacity
of
the
image
arising
from
the
superior
number
where
the
difference
is
so
inconsiderable
we
have
a
parallel
instance
in
the
affections
it
is
evident
according
to
the
principles
that
when
an
object
produces
any
passion
in
us
which
varies
according
to
the
different
quantity
of
the
object
i
say
it
is
evident
that
the
passion
properly
speaking
is
not
a
simple
emotion
but
a
compounded
one
of
a
great
number
of
weaker
passions
derived
from
a
view
of
each
part
of
the
object
for
otherwise
it
were
impossible
the
passion
should
encrease
by
the
encrease
of
these
parts
thus
a
man
who
desires
a
thousand
pound
has
in
reality
a
thousand
or
more
desires
which
uniting
together
seem
to
make
only
one
passion
though
the
composition
evidently
betrays
itself
upon
every
alteration
of
the
object
by
the
preference
he
gives
to
the
larger
number
if
superior
only
by
an
unite
yet
nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
so
small
a
difference
would
not
be
discernible
in
the
passions
nor
coued
render
them
distinguishable
from
each
other
the
difference
therefore
of
our
conduct
in
preferring
the
greater
number
depends
not
upon
our
passions
but
upon
custom
and
general
rules
we
have
found
in
a
multitude
of
instances
that
the
augmenting
the
numbers
of
any
sum
augments
the
passion
where
the
numbers
are
precise
and
the
difference
sensible
the
mind
can
perceive
from
its
immediate
feeling
that
three
guineas
produce
a
greater
passion
than
two
and
this
it
transfers
to
larger
numbers
because
of
the
resemblance
and
by
a
general
rule
assigns
to
a
thousand
guineas
a
stronger
passion
than
to
nine
hundred
and
ninety
nine
these
general
rules
we
shall
explain
presently
but
beside
these
two
species
of
probability
which
derived
from
an
imperfect
experience
and
from
contrary
causes
there
is
a
third
arising
from
analogy
which
differs
from
them
in
some
material
circumstances
according
to
the
hypothesis
above
explained
all
kinds
of
reasoning
from
causes
or
effects
are
founded
on
two
particulars
the
constant
conjunction
of
any
two
objects
in
all
past
experience
and
the
resemblance
of
a
present
object
to
any
one
of
them
the
effect
of
these
two
particulars
is
that
the
present
object
invigorates
and
inlivens
the
imagination
and
the
resemblance
along
with
the
constant
union
conveys
this
force
and
vivacity
to
the
related
idea
which
we
are
therefore
said
to
believe
or
assent
to
if
you
weaken
either
the
union
or
resemblance
you
weaken
the
principle
of
transition
and
of
consequence
that
belief
which
arises
from
it
the
vivacity
of
the
first
impression
can
not
be
fully
conveyed
to
the
related
idea
either
where
the
conjunction
of
their
objects
is
not
constant
or
where
the
present
impression
does
not
perfectly
resemble
any
of
those
whose
union
we
are
accustomed
to
observe
in
those
probabilities
of
chance
and
causes
it
is
the
constancy
of
the
union
which
is
diminished
and
in
the
probability
derived
from
analogy
it
is
the
resemblance
only
which
is
affected
without
some
degree
of
resemblance
as
well
as
union
it
is
impossible
there
can
be
any
reasoning
but
as
this
resemblance
admits
of
many
different
degrees
the
reasoning
becomes
proportionably
more
or
less
firm
and
certain
an
experiment
loses
of
its
force
when
transferred
to
instances
which
are
not
exactly
resembling
though
it
is
evident
it
may
still
retain
as
much
as
may
be
the
foundation
of
probability
as
long
as
there
is
any
resemblance
remaining
sect
xiii
of
unphilosophical
probability
all
these
kinds
of
probability
are
received
by
philosophers
and
allowed
to
be
reasonable
foundations
of
belief
and
opinion
but
there
are
others
that
are
derived
from
the
same
principles
though
they
have
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
the
same
sanction
the
first
probability
of
this
kind
may
be
accounted
for
thus
the
diminution
of
the
union
and
of
the
resemblance
as
above
explained
diminishes
the
facility
of
the
transition
and
by
that
means
weakens
the
evidence
and
we
may
farther
observe
that
the
same
diminution
of
the
evidence
will
follow
from
a
diminution
of
the
impression
and
from
the
shading
of
those
colours
under
which
it
appears
to
the
memory
or
senses
the
argument
which
we
found
on
any
matter
of
fact
we
remember
is
more
or
less
convincing
according
as
the
fact
is
recent
or
remote
and
though
the
difference
in
these
degrees
of
evidence
be
not
received
by
philosophy
as
solid
and
legitimate
because
in
that
case
an
argument
must
have
a
different
force
to
day
from
what
it
shall
have
a
month
hence
yet
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
philosophy
it
is
certain
this
circumstance
has
a
considerable
influence
on
the
understanding
and
secretly
changes
the
authority
of
the
same
argument
according
to
the
different
times
in
which
it
is
proposed
to
us
a
greater
force
and
vivacity
in
the
impression
naturally
conveys
a
greater
to
the
related
idea
and
it
is
on
the
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
that
the
belief
depends
according
to
the
foregoing
system
there
is
a
second
difference
which
we
may
frequently
observe
in
our
degrees
of
belief
and
assurance
and
which
never
fails
to
take
place
though
disclaimed
by
philosophers
an
experiment
that
is
recent
and
fresh
in
the
memory
affects
us
more
than
one
that
is
in
some
measure
obliterated
and
has
a
superior
influence
on
the
judgment
as
well
as
on
the
passions
a
lively
impression
produces
more
assurance
than
a
faint
one
because
it
has
more
original
force
to
communicate
to
the
related
idea
which
thereby
acquires
a
greater
force
and
vivacity
a
recent
observation
has
a
like
effect
because
the
custom
and
transition
is
there
more
entire
and
preserves
better
the
original
force
in
the
communication
thus
a
drunkard
who
has
seen
his
companion
die
of
a
debauch
is
struck
with
that
instance
for
some
time
and
dreads
a
like
accident
for
himself
but
as
the
memory
of
it
decays
away
by
degrees
his
former
security
returns
and
the
danger
seems
less
certain
and
real
i
add
as
a
third
instance
of
this
kind
that
though
our
reasonings
from
proofs
and
from
probabilities
be
considerably
different
from
each
other
yet
the
former
species
of
reasoning
often
degenerates
insensibly
into
the
latter
by
nothing
but
the
multitude
of
connected
arguments
it
is
certain
that
when
an
inference
is
drawn
immediately
from
an
object
without
any
intermediate
cause
or
effect
the
conviction
is
much
stronger
and
the
persuasion
more
lively
than
when
the
imagination
is
carryed
through
a
long
chain
of
connected
arguments
however
infallible
the
connexion
of
each
link
may
be
esteemed
it
is
from
the
original
impression
that
the
vivacity
of
all
the
ideas
is
derived
by
means
of
the
customary
transition
of
the
imagination
and
it
is
evident
this
vivacity
must
gradually
decay
in
proportion
to
the
distance
and
must
lose
somewhat
in
each
transition
sometimes
this
distance
has
a
greater
influence
than
even
contrary
experiments
would
have
and
a
man
may
receive
a
more
lively
conviction
from
a
probable
reasoning
which
is
close
and
immediate
than
from
a
long
chain
of
consequences
though
just
and
conclusive
in
each
part
nay
it
is
seldom
such
reasonings
produce
any
conviction
and
one
must
have
a
very
strong
and
firm
imagination
to
preserve
the
evidence
to
the
end
where
it
passes
through
so
many
stages
but
here
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
remark
a
very
curious
phaenomenon
which
the
present
subject
suggests
to
us
it
is
evident
there
is
no
point
of
ancient
history
of
which
we
can
have
any
assurance
but
by
passing
through
many
millions
of
causes
and
effects
and
through
a
chain
of
arguments
of
almost
an
immeasurable
length
before
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
coued
come
to
the
first
historian
it
must
be
conveyed
through
many
mouths
and
after
it
is
committed
to
writing
each
new
copy
is
a
new
object
of
which
the
connexion
with
the
foregoing
is
known
only
by
experience
and
observation
perhaps
therefore
it
may
be
concluded
from
the
precedent
reasoning
that
the
evidence
of
all
ancient
history
must
now
be
lost
or
at
least
will
be
lost
in
time
as
the
chain
of
causes
encreases
and
runs
on
to
a
greater
length
but
as
it
seems
contrary
to
common
sense
to
think
that
if
the
republic
of
letters
and
the
art
of
printing
continue
on
the
same
footing
as
at
present
our
posterity
even
after
a
thousand
ages
can
ever
doubt
if
there
has
been
such
a
man
as
julius
caesar
this
may
be
considered
as
an
objection
to
the
present
system
if
belief
consisted
only
in
a
certain
vivacity
conveyed
from
an
original
impression
it
would
decay
by
the
length
of
the
transition
and
must
at
last
be
utterly
extinguished
and
vice
versa
if
belief
on
some
occasions
be
not
capable
of
such
an
extinction
it
must
be
something
different
from
that
vivacity
before
i
answer
this
objection
i
shall
observe
that
from
this
topic
there
has
been
borrowed
a
very
celebrated
argument
against
the
christian
religion
but
with
this
difference
that
the
connexion
betwixt
each
link
of
the
chain
in
human
testimony
has
been
there
supposed
not
to
go
beyond
probability
and
to
be
liable
to
a
degree
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
and
indeed
it
must
be
confest
that
in
this
manner
of
considering
the
subject
which
however
is
not
a
true
one
there
is
no
history
or
tradition
but
what
must
in
the
end
lose
all
its
force
and
evidence
every
new
probability
diminishes
the
original
conviction
and
however
great
that
conviction
may
be
supposed
it
is
impossible
it
can
subsist
under
such
diminutions
this
is
true
in
general
though
we
shall
find
part
iv
sect
afterwards
that
there
is
one
very
memorable
exception
which
is
of
vast
consequence
in
the
present
subject
of
the
understanding
mean
while
to
give
a
solution
of
the
preceding
objection
upon
the
supposition
that
historical
evidence
amounts
at
first
to
an
entire
proof
let
us
consider
that
though
the
links
are
innumerable
that
connect
any
original
fact
with
the
present
impression
which
is
the
foundation
of
belief
yet
they
are
all
of
the
same
kind
and
depend
on
the
fidelity
of
printers
and
copyists
one
edition
passes
into
another
and
that
into
a
third
and
so
on
till
we
come
to
that
volume
we
peruse
at
present
there
is
no
variation
in
the
steps
after
we
know
one
we
know
all
of
them
and
after
we
have
made
one
we
can
have
no
scruple
as
to
the
rest
this
circumstance
alone
preserves
the
evidence
of
history
and
will
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
present
age
to
the
latest
posterity
if
all
the
long
chain
of
causes
and
effects
which
connect
any
past
event
with
any
volume
of
history
were
composed
of
parts
different
from
each
other
and
which
it
were
necessary
for
the
mind
distinctly
to
conceive
it
is
impossible
we
should
preserve
to
the
end
any
belief
or
evidence
but
as
most
of
these
proofs
are
perfectly
resembling
the
mind
runs
easily
along
them
jumps
from
one
part
to
another
with
facility
and
forms
but
a
confused
and
general
notion
of
each
link
by
this
means
a
long
chain
of
argument
has
as
little
effect
in
diminishing
the
original
vivacity
as
a
much
shorter
would
have
if
composed
of
parts
which
were
different
from
each
other
and
of
which
each
required
a
distinct
consideration
a
fourth
unphilosophical
species
of
probability
is
that
derived
from
general
rules
which
we
rashly
form
to
ourselves
and
which
are
the
source
of
what
we
properly
call
prejudice
an
irishman
can
not
have
wit
and
a
frenchman
can
not
have
solidity
for
which
reason
though
the
conversation
of
the
former
in
any
instance
be
visibly
very
agreeable
and
of
the
latter
very
judicious
we
have
entertained
such
a
prejudice
against
them
that
they
must
be
dunces
or
fops
in
spite
of
sense
and
reason
human
nature
is
very
subject
to
errors
of
this
kind
and
perhaps
this
nation
as
much
as
any
other
should
it
be
demanded
why
men
form
general
rules
and
allow
them
to
influence
their
judgment
even
contrary
to
present
observation
and
experience
i
should
reply
that
in
my
opinion
it
proceeds
from
those
very
principles
on
which
all
judgments
concerning
causes
and
effects
depend
our
judgments
concerning
cause
and
effect
are
derived
from
habit
and
experience
and
when
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
one
object
united
to
another
our
imagination
passes
from
the
first
to
the
second
by
a
natural
transition
which
precedes
reflection
and
which
can
not
be
prevented
by
it
now
it
is
the
nature
of
custom
not
only
to
operate
with
its
full
force
when
objects
are
presented
that
are
exactly
the
same
with
those
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
but
also
to
operate
in
an
inferior
degree
when
we
discover
such
as
are
similar
and
though
the
habit
loses
somewhat
of
its
force
by
every
difference
yet
it
is
seldom
entirely
destroyed
where
any
considerable
circumstances
remain
the
same
a
man
who
has
contracted
a
custom
of
eating
fruit
by
the
use
of
pears
or
peaches
will
satisfy
himself
with
melons
where
he
can
not
find
his
favourite
fruit
as
one
who
has
become
a
drunkard
by
the
use
of
red
wines
will
be
carried
almost
with
the
same
violence
to
white
if
presented
to
him
from
this
principle
i
have
accounted
for
that
species
of
probability
derived
from
analogy
where
we
transfer
our
experience
in
past
instances
to
objects
which
are
resembling
but
are
not
exactly
the
same
with
those
concerning
which
we
have
had
experience
in
proportion
as
the
resemblance
decays
the
probability
diminishes
but
still
has
some
force
as
long
as
there
remain
any
traces
of
the
resemblance
this
observation
we
may
carry
farther
and
may
remark
that
though
custom
be
the
foundation
of
all
our
judgments
yet
sometimes
it
has
an
effect
on
the
imagination
in
opposition
to
the
judgment
and
produces
a
contrariety
in
our
sentiments
concerning
the
same
object
i
explain
myself
in
almost
all
kinds
of
causes
there
is
a
complication
of
circumstances
of
which
some
are
essential
and
others
superfluous
some
are
absolutely
requisite
to
the
production
of
the
effect
and
others
are
only
conjoined
by
accident
now
we
may
observe
that
when
these
superfluous
circumstances
are
numerous
and
remarkable
and
frequently
conjoined
with
the
essential
they
have
such
an
influence
on
the
imagination
that
even
in
the
absence
of
the
latter
they
carry
us
on
to
conception
of
the
usual
effect
and
give
to
that
conception
a
force
and
vivacity
which
make
it
superior
to
the
mere
fictions
of
the
fancy
we
may
correct
this
propensity
by
a
reflection
on
the
nature
of
those
circumstances
but
it
is
still
certain
that
custom
takes
the
start
and
gives
a
biass
to
the
imagination
to
illustrate
this
by
a
familiar
instance
let
us
consider
the
case
of
a
man
who
being
hung
out
from
a
high
tower
in
a
cage
of
iron
can
not
forbear
trembling
when
he
surveys
the
precipice
below
him
though
he
knows
himself
to
be
perfectly
secure
from
falling
by
his
experience
of
the
solidity
of
the
iron
which
supports
him
and
though
the
ideas
of
fall
and
descent
and
harm
and
death
be
derived
solely
from
custom
and
experience
the
same
custom
goes
beyond
the
instances
from
which
it
is
derived
and
to
which
it
perfectly
corresponds
and
influences
his
ideas
of
such
objects
as
are
in
some
respect
resembling
but
fall
not
precisely
under
the
same
rule
the
circumstances
of
depth
and
descent
strike
so
strongly
upon
him
that
their
influence
be
destroyed
by
the
contrary
circumstances
of
support
and
solidity
which
ought
to
give
him
a
perfect
security
his
imagination
runs
away
with
its
object
and
excites
a
passion
proportioned
to
it
that
passion
returns
back
upon
the
imagination
and
inlivens
the
idea
which
lively
idea
has
a
new
influence
on
the
passion
and
in
its
turn
augments
its
force
and
violence
and
both
his
fancy
and
affections
thus
mutually
supporting
each
other
cause
the
whole
to
have
a
very
great
influence
upon
him
but
why
need
we
seek
for
other
instances
while
the
present
subject
of
philosophical
probabilities
offers
us
so
obvious
an
one
in
the
opposition
betwixt
the
judgment
and
imagination
arising
from
these
effects
of
custom
according
to
my
system
all
reasonings
are
nothing
but
the
effects
of
custom
and
custom
has
no
influence
but
by
inlivening
the
imagination
and
giving
us
a
strong
conception
of
any
object
it
may
therefore
be
concluded
that
our
judgment
and
imagination
can
never
be
contrary
and
that
custom
can
not
operate
on
the
latter
faculty
after
such
a
manner
as
to
render
it
opposite
to
the
former
this
difficulty
we
can
remove
after
no
other
manner
than
by
supposing
the
influence
of
general
rules
we
shall
afterwards
take
sect
notice
of
some
general
rules
by
which
we
ought
to
regulate
our
judgment
concerning
causes
and
effects
and
these
rules
are
formed
on
the
nature
of
our
understanding
and
on
our
experience
of
its
operations
in
the
judgments
we
form
concerning
objects
by
them
we
learn
to
distinguish
the
accidental
circumstances
from
the
efficacious
causes
and
when
we
find
that
an
effect
can
be
produced
without
the
concurrence
of
any
particular
circumstance
we
conclude
that
that
circumstance
makes
not
a
part
of
the
efficacious
cause
however
frequently
conjoined
with
it
but
as
this
frequent
conjunction
necessity
makes
it
have
some
effect
on
the
imagination
in
spite
of
the
opposite
conclusion
from
general
rules
the
opposition
of
these
two
principles
produces
a
contrariety
in
our
thoughts
and
causes
us
to
ascribe
the
one
inference
to
our
judgment
and
the
other
to
our
imagination
the
general
rule
is
attributed
to
our
judgment
as
being
more
extensive
and
constant
the
exception
to
the
imagination
as
being
more
capricious
and
uncertain
thus
our
general
rules
are
in
a
manner
set
in
opposition
to
each
other
when
an
object
appears
that
resembles
any
cause
in
very
considerable
circumstances
the
imagination
naturally
carries
us
to
a
lively
conception
of
the
usual
effect
though
the
object
be
different
in
the
most
material
and
most
efficacious
circumstances
from
that
cause
here
is
the
first
influence
of
general
rules
but
when
we
take
a
review
of
this
act
of
the
mind
and
compare
it
with
the
more
general
and
authentic
operations
of
the
understanding
we
find
it
to
be
of
an
irregular
nature
and
destructive
of
all
the
most
established
principles
of
reasonings
which
is
the
cause
of
our
rejecting
it
this
is
a
second
influence
of
general
rules
and
implies
the
condemnation
of
the
former
sometimes
the
one
sometimes
the
other
prevails
according
to
the
disposition
and
character
of
the
person
the
vulgar
are
commonly
guided
by
the
first
and
wise
men
by
the
second
mean
while
the
sceptics
may
here
have
the
pleasure
of
observing
a
new
and
signal
contradiction
in
our
reason
and
of
seeing
all
philosophy
ready
to
be
subverted
by
a
principle
of
human
nature
and
again
saved
by
a
new
direction
of
the
very
same
principle
the
following
of
general
rules
is
a
very
unphilosophical
species
of
probability
and
yet
it
is
only
by
following
them
that
we
can
correct
this
and
all
other
unphilosophical
probabilities
since
we
have
instances
where
general
rules
operate
on
the
imagination
even
contrary
to
the
judgment
we
need
not
be
surprized
to
see
their
effects
encrease
when
conjoined
with
that
latter
faculty
and
to
observe
that
they
bestow
on
the
ideas
they
present
to
us
a
force
superior
to
what
attends
any
other
every
one
knows
there
is
an
indirect
manner
of
insinuating
praise
or
blame
which
is
much
less
shocking
than
the
open
flattery
or
censure
of
any
person
however
he
may
communicate
his
sentiments
by
such
secret
insinuations
and
make
them
known
with
equal
certainty
as
by
the
open
discovery
of
them
it
is
certain
that
their
influence
is
not
equally
strong
and
powerful
one
who
lashes
me
with
concealed
strokes
of
satire
moves
not
my
indignation
to
such
a
degree
as
if
he
flatly
told
me
i
was
a
fool
and
coxcomb
though
i
equally
understand
his
meaning
as
if
he
did
this
difference
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
influence
of
general
rules
whether
a
person
openly
abuses
me
or
slyly
intimates
his
contempt
in
neither
case
do
i
immediately
perceive
his
sentiment
or
opinion
and
it
is
only
by
signs
that
is
by
its
effects
i
become
sensible
of
it
the
only
difference
then
betwixt
these
two
cases
consists
in
this
that
in
the
open
discovery
of
his
sentiments
he
makes
use
of
signs
which
are
general
and
universal
and
in
the
secret
intimation
employs
such
as
are
more
singular
and
uncommon
the
effect
of
this
circumstance
is
that
the
imagination
in
running
from
the
present
impression
to
the
absent
idea
makes
the
transition
with
greater
facility
and
consequently
conceives
the
object
with
greater
force
where
the
connexion
is
common
and
universal
than
where
it
is
more
rare
and
particular
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
the
open
declaration
of
our
sentiments
is
called
the
taking
off
the
mask
as
the
secret
intimation
of
our
opinions
is
said
to
be
the
veiling
of
them
the
difference
betwixt
an
idea
produced
by
a
general
connexion
and
that
arising
from
a
particular
one
is
here
compared
to
the
difference
betwixt
an
impression
and
an
idea
this
difference
in
the
imagination
has
a
suitable
effect
on
the
passions
and
this
effect
is
augmented
by
another
circumstance
a
secret
intimation
of
anger
or
contempt
shews
that
we
still
have
some
consideration
for
the
person
and
avoid
the
directly
abusing
him
this
makes
a
concealed
satire
less
disagreeable
but
still
this
depends
on
the
same
principle
for
if
an
idea
were
not
more
feeble
when
only
intimated
it
would
never
be
esteemed
a
mark
of
greater
respect
to
proceed
in
this
method
than
in
the
other
sometimes
scurrility
is
less
displeasing
than
delicate
satire
because
it
revenges
us
in
a
manner
for
the
injury
at
the
very
time
it
is
committed
by
affording
us
a
just
reason
to
blame
and
contemn
the
person
who
injures
us
but
this
phaenomenon
likewise
depends
upon
the
same
principle
for
why
do
we
blame
all
gross
and
injurious
language
unless
it
be
because
we
esteem
it
contrary
to
good
breeding
and
humanity
and
why
is
it
contrary
unless
it
be
more
shocking
than
any
delicate
satire
the
rules
of
good
breeding
condemn
whatever
is
openly
disobliging
and
gives
a
sensible
pain
and
confusion
to
those
with
whom
we
converse
after
this
is
once
established
abusive
language
is
universally
blamed
and
gives
less
pain
upon
account
of
its
coarseness
and
incivility
which
render
the
person
despicable
that
employs
it
it
becomes
less
disagreeable
merely
because
originally
it
is
more
so
and
it
is
more
disagreeable
because
it
affords
an
inference
by
general
and
common
rules
that
are
palpable
and
undeniable
to
this
explication
of
the
different
influence
of
open
and
concealed
flattery
or
satire
i
shall
add
the
consideration
of
another
phenomenon
which
is
analogous
to
it
there
are
many
particulars
in
the
point
of
honour
both
of
men
and
women
whose
violations
when
open
and
avowed
the
world
never
excuses
but
which
it
is
more
apt
to
overlook
when
the
appearances
are
saved
and
the
transgression
is
secret
and
concealed
even
those
who
know
with
equal
certainty
that
the
fault
is
committed
pardon
it
more
easily
when
the
proofs
seem
in
some
measure
oblique
and
equivocal
than
when
they
are
direct
and
undeniable
the
same
idea
is
presented
in
both
cases
and
properly
speaking
is
equally
assented
to
by
the
judgment
and
yet
its
influence
is
different
because
of
the
different
manner
in
which
it
is
presented
now
if
we
compare
these
two
cases
of
the
open
and
concealed
violations
of
the
laws
of
honour
we
shall
find
that
the
difference
betwixt
them
consists
in
this
that
in
the
first
ease
the
sign
from
which
we
infer
the
blameable
action
is
single
and
suffices
alone
to
be
the
foundation
of
our
reasoning
and
judgment
whereas
in
the
latter
the
signs
are
numerous
and
decide
little
or
nothing
when
alone
and
unaccompanyed
with
many
minute
circumstances
which
are
almost
imperceptible
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
any
reasoning
is
always
the
more
convincing
the
more
single
and
united
it
is
to
the
eye
and
the
less
exercise
it
gives
to
the
imagination
to
collect
all
its
parts
and
run
from
them
to
the
correlative
idea
which
forms
the
conclusion
the
labour
of
the
thought
disturbs
the
regular
progress
of
the
sentiments
as
we
shall
observe
presently
part
iv
sect
the
idea
strikes
not
on
us
with
ouch
vivacity
and
consequently
has
no
such
influence
on
the
passion
and
imagination
from
the
same
principles
we
may
account
for
those
observations
of
the
cardinal
de
retz
that
there
are
many
things
in
which
the
world
wishes
to
be
deceived
and
that
it
more
easily
excuses
a
person
in
acting
than
in
talking
contrary
to
the
decorum
of
his
profession
and
character
a
fault
in
words
is
commonly
more
open
and
distinct
than
one
in
actions
which
admit
of
many
palliating
excuses
and
decide
not
so
clearly
concerning
the
intention
and
views
of
the
actor
thus
it
appears
upon
the
whole
that
every
kind
of
opinion
or
judgment
which
amounts
not
to
knowledge
is
derived
entirely
from
the
force
and
vivacity
of
the
perception
and
that
these
qualities
constitute
in
the
mind
what
we
call
the
belief
of
the
existence
of
any
object
this
force
and
this
vivacity
are
most
conspicuous
in
the
memory
and
therefore
our
confidence
in
the
veracity
of
that
faculty
is
the
greatest
imaginable
and
equals
in
many
respects
the
assurance
of
a
demonstration
the
next
degree
of
these
qualities
is
that
derived
from
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
and
this
too
is
very
great
especially
when
the
conjunction
is
found
by
experience
to
be
perfectly
constant
and
when
the
object
which
is
present
to
us
exactly
resembles
those
of
which
we
have
had
experience
but
below
this
degree
of
evidence
there
are
many
others
which
have
an
influence
on
the
passions
and
imagination
proportioned
to
that
degree
of
force
and
vivacity
which
they
communicate
to
the
ideas
it
is
by
habit
we
make
the
transition
from
cause
to
effect
and
it
is
from
some
present
impression
we
borrow
that
vivacity
which
we
diffuse
over
the
correlative
idea
but
when
we
have
not
observed
a
sufficient
number
of
instances
to
produce
a
strong
habit
or
when
these
instances
are
contrary
to
each
other
or
when
the
resemblance
is
not
exact
or
the
present
impression
is
faint
and
obscure
or
the
experience
in
some
measure
obliterated
from
the
memory
or
the
connexion
dependent
on
a
long
chain
of
objects
or
the
inference
derived
from
general
rules
and
yet
not
conformable
to
them
in
all
these
cases
the
evidence
diminishes
by
the
diminution
of
the
force
and
intenseness
of
the
idea
this
therefore
is
the
nature
of
the
judgment
and
probability
what
principally
gives
authority
to
this
system
is
beside
the
undoubted
arguments
upon
which
each
part
is
founded
the
agreement
of
these
parts
and
the
necessity
of
one
to
explain
another
the
belief
which
attends
our
memory
is
of
the
same
nature
with
that
which
is
derived
from
our
judgments
nor
is
there
any
difference
betwixt
that
judgment
which
is
derived
from
a
constant
and
uniform
connexion
of
causes
and
effects
and
that
which
depends
upon
an
interrupted
and
uncertain
it
is
indeed
evident
that
in
all
determinations
where
the
mind
decides
from
contrary
experiments
it
is
first
divided
within
itself
and
has
an
inclination
to
either
side
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
experiments
we
have
seen
and
remember
this
contest
is
at
last
determined
to
the
advantage
of
that
side
where
we
observe
a
superior
number
of
these
experiments
but
still
with
a
diminution
of
force
in
the
evidence
correspondent
to
the
number
of
the
opposite
experiments
each
possibility
of
which
the
probability
is
composed
operates
separately
upon
the
imagination
and
it
is
the
larger
collection
of
possibilities
which
at
last
prevails
and
that
with
a
force
proportionable
to
its
superiority
all
these
phenomena
lead
directly
to
the
precedent
system
nor
will
it
ever
be
possible
upon
any
other
principles
to
give
a
satisfactory
and
consistent
explication
of
them
without
considering
these
judgments
as
the
effects
of
custom
on
the
imagination
we
shall
lose
ourselves
in
perpetual
contradiction
and
absurdity
sect
xiv
of
the
idea
of
necessary
connexion
having
thus
explained
the
manner
in
which
we
reason
beyond
our
immediate
impressions
and
conclude
that
such
particular
causes
must
have
such
particular
effects
we
must
now
return
upon
our
footsteps
to
examine
that
question
which
sect
first
occured
to
us
and
which
we
dropt
in
our
way
viz
what
is
our
idea
of
necessity
when
we
say
that
two
objects
are
necessarily
connected
together
upon
this
head
i
repeat
what
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
observe
that
as
we
have
no
idea
that
is
not
derived
from
an
impression
we
must
find
some
impression
that
gives
rise
to
this
idea
of
necessity
if
we
assert
we
have
really
such
an
idea
in
order
to
this
i
consider
in
what
objects
necessity
is
commonly
supposed
to
lie
and
finding
that
it
is
always
ascribed
to
causes
and
effects
i
turn
my
eye
to
two
objects
supposed
to
be
placed
in
that
relation
and
examine
them
in
all
the
situations
of
which
they
are
susceptible
i
immediately
perceive
that
they
are
contiguous
in
time
and
place
and
that
the
object
we
call
cause
precedes
the
other
we
call
effect
in
no
one
instance
can
i
go
any
farther
nor
is
it
possible
for
me
to
discover
any
third
relation
betwixt
these
objects
i
therefore
enlarge
my
view
to
comprehend
several
instances
where
i
find
like
objects
always
existing
in
like
relations
of
contiguity
and
succession
at
first
sight
this
seems
to
serve
but
little
to
my
purpose
the
reflection
on
several
instances
only
repeats
the
same
objects
and
therefore
can
never
give
rise
to
a
new
idea
but
upon
farther
enquiry
i
find
that
the
repetition
is
not
in
every
particular
the
same
but
produces
a
new
impression
and
by
that
means
the
idea
which
i
at
present
examine
for
after
a
frequent
repetition
i
find
that
upon
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
objects
the
mind
is
determined
by
custom
to
consider
its
usual
attendant
and
to
consider
it
in
a
stronger
light
upon
account
of
its
relation
to
the
first
object
it
is
this
impression
then
or
determination
which
affords
me
the
idea
of
necessity
i
doubt
not
but
these
consequences
will
at
first
sight
be
received
without
difficulty
as
being
evident
deductions
from
principles
which
we
have
already
established
and
which
we
have
often
employed
in
our
reasonings
this
evidence
both
in
the
first
principles
and
in
the
deductions
may
seduce
us
unwarily
into
the
conclusion
and
make
us
imagine
it
contains
nothing
extraordinary
nor
worthy
of
our
curiosity
but
though
such
an
inadvertence
may
facilitate
the
reception
of
this
reasoning
it
will
make
it
be
the
more
easily
forgot
for
which
reason
i
think
it
proper
to
give
warning
that
i
have
just
now
examined
one
of
the
most
sublime
questions
in
philosophy
viz
that
concerning
the
power
and
efficacy
of
causes
where
all
the
sciences
seem
so
much
interested
such
a
warning
will
naturally
rouze
up
the
attention
of
the
reader
and
make
him
desire
a
more
full
account
of
my
doctrine
as
well
as
of
the
arguments
on
which
it
is
founded
this
request
is
so
reasonable
that
i
can
not
refuse
complying
with
it
especially
as
i
am
hopeful
that
these
principles
the
more
they
are
examined
will
acquire
the
more
force
and
evidence
there
is
no
question
which
on
account
of
its
importance
as
well
as
difficulty
has
caused
more
disputes
both
among
antient
and
modern
philosophers
than
this
concerning
the
efficacy
of
causes
or
that
quality
which
makes
them
be
followed
by
their
effects
but
before
they
entered
upon
these
disputes
methinks
it
would
not
have
been
improper
to
have
examined
what
idea
we
have
of
that
efficacy
which
is
the
subject
of
the
controversy
this
is
what
i
find
principally
wanting
in
their
reasonings
and
what
i
shall
here
endeavour
to
supply
i
begin
with
observing
that
the
terms
of
efficacy
agency
power
force
energy
necessity
connexion
and
productive
quality
are
all
nearly
synonymous
and
therefore
it
is
an
absurdity
to
employ
any
of
them
in
defining
the
rest
by
this
observation
we
reject
at
once
all
the
vulgar
definitions
which
philosophers
have
given
of
power
and
efficacy
and
instead
of
searching
for
the
idea
in
these
definitions
must
look
for
it
in
the
impressions
from
which
it
is
originally
derived
if
it
be
a
compound
idea
it
must
arise
from
compound
impressions
if
simple
from
simple
impressions
i
believe
the
most
general
and
most
popular
explication
of
this
matter
is
to
say
see
locke
chapter
of
power
that
finding
from
experience
that
there
are
several
new
productions
in
matter
such
as
the
motions
and
variations
of
body
and
concluding
that
there
must
somewhere
be
a
power
capable
of
producing
them
we
arrive
at
last
by
this
reasoning
at
the
idea
of
power
and
efficacy
but
to
be
convinced
that
this
explication
is
more
popular
than
philosophical
we
need
but
reflect
on
two
very
obvious
principles
first
that
reason
alone
can
never
give
rise
to
any
original
idea
and
secondly
that
reason
as
distinguished
from
experience
can
never
make
us
conclude
that
a
cause
or
productive
quality
is
absolutely
requisite
to
every
beginning
of
existence
both
these
considerations
have
been
sufficiently
explained
and
therefore
shall
not
at
present
be
any
farther
insisted
on
i
shall
only
infer
from
them
that
since
reason
can
never
give
rise
to
the
idea
of
efficacy
that
idea
must
be
derived
from
experience
and
from
some
particular
instances
of
this
efficacy
which
make
their
passage
into
the
mind
by
the
common
channels
of
sensation
or
reflection
ideas
always
represent
their
objects
or
impressions
and
vice
versa
there
are
some
objects
necessary
to
give
rise
to
every
idea
if
we
pretend
therefore
to
have
any
just
idea
of
this
efficacy
we
must
produce
some
instance
wherein
the
efficacy
is
plainly
discoverable
to
the
mind
and
its
operations
obvious
to
our
consciousness
or
sensation
by
the
refusal
of
this
we
acknowledge
that
the
idea
is
impossible
and
imaginary
since
the
principle
of
innate
ideas
which
alone
can
save
us
from
this
dilemma
has
been
already
refuted
and
is
now
almost
universally
rejected
in
the
learned
world
our
present
business
then
must
be
to
find
some
natural
production
where
the
operation
and
efficacy
of
a
cause
can
be
clearly
conceived
and
comprehended
by
the
mind
without
any
danger
of
obscurity
or
mistake
in
this
research
we
meet
with
very
little
encouragement
from
that
prodigious
diversity
which
is
found
in
the
opinions
of
those
philosophers
who
have
pretended
to
explain
the
secret
force
and
energy
of
causes
see
father
malbranche
book
vi
part
chap
and
the
illustrations
upon
it
there
are
some
who
maintain
that
bodies
operate
by
their
substantial
form
others
by
their
accidents
or
qualities
several
by
their
matter
and
form
some
by
their
form
and
accidents
others
by
certain
virtues
and
faculties
distinct
from
all
this
all
these
sentiments
again
are
mixed
and
varyed
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
form
a
strong
presumption
that
none
of
them
have
any
solidity
or
evidence
and
that
the
supposition
of
an
efficacy
in
any
of
the
known
qualities
of
matter
is
entirely
without
foundation
this
presumption
must
encrease
upon
us
when
we
consider
that
these
principles
of
substantial
forms
and
accidents
and
faculties
are
not
in
reality
any
of
the
known
properties
of
bodies
but
are
perfectly
unintelligible
and
inexplicable
for
it
is
evident
philosophers
would
never
have
had
recourse
to
such
obscure
and
uncertain
principles
had
they
met
with
any
satisfaction
in
such
as
are
clear
and
intelligible
especially
in
such
an
affair
as
this
which
must
be
an
object
of
the
simplest
understanding
if
not
of
the
senses
upon
the
whole
we
may
conclude
that
it
is
impossible
in
any
one
instance
to
shew
the
principle
in
which
the
force
and
agency
of
a
cause
is
placed
and
that
the
most
refined
and
most
vulgar
understandings
are
equally
at
a
loss
in
this
particular
if
any
one
think
proper
to
refute
this
assertion
he
need
not
put
himself
to
the
trouble
of
inventing
any
long
reasonings
but
may
at
once
shew
us
an
instance
of
a
cause
where
we
discover
the
power
or
operating
principle
this
defiance
we
are
obliged
frequently
to
make
use
of
as
being
almost
the
only
means
of
proving
a
negative
in
philosophy
the
small
success
which
has
been
met
with
in
all
the
attempts
to
fix
this
power
has
at
last
obliged
philosophers
to
conclude
that
the
ultimate
force
and
efficacy
of
nature
is
perfectly
unknown
to
us
and
that
it
is
in
vain
we
search
for
it
in
all
the
known
qualities
of
matter
in
this
opinion
they
are
almost
unanimous
and
it
is
only
in
the
inference
they
draw
from
it
that
they
discover
any
difference
in
their
sentiments
for
some
of
them
as
the
cartesians
in
particular
having
established
it
as
a
principle
that
we
are
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
essence
of
matter
have
very
naturally
inferred
that
it
is
endowed
with
no
efficacy
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
it
of
itself
to
communicate
motion
or
produce
any
of
those
effects
which
we
ascribe
to
it
as
the
essence
of
matter
consists
in
extension
and
as
extension
implies
not
actual
motion
but
only
mobility
they
conclude
that
the
energy
which
produces
the
motion
can
not
lie
in
the
extension
this
conclusion
leads
them
into
another
which
they
regard
as
perfectly
unavoidable
matter
say
they
is
in
itself
entirely
unactive
and
deprived
of
any
power
by
which
it
may
produce
or
continue
or
communicate
motion
but
since
these
effects
are
evident
to
our
senses
and
since
the
power
that
produces
them
must
be
placed
somewhere
it
must
lie
in
the
deity
or
that
divine
being
who
contains
in
his
nature
all
excellency
and
perfection
it
is
the
deity
therefore
who
is
the
prime
mover
of
the
universe
and
who
not
only
first
created
matter
and
gave
it
it
original
impulse
but
likewise
by
a
continued
exertion
of
omnipotence
supports
its
existence
and
successively
bestows
on
it
all
those
motions
and
configurations
and
qualities
with
which
it
is
endowed
this
opinion
is
certainly
very
curious
and
well
worth
our
attention
but
it
will
appear
superfluous
to
examine
it
in
this
place
if
we
reflect
a
moment
on
our
present
purpose
in
taking
notice
of
it
we
have
established
it
as
a
principle
that
as
all
ideas
are
derived
from
impressions
or
some
precedent
perceptions
it
is
impossible
we
can
have
any
idea
of
power
and
efficacy
unless
some
instances
can
be
produced
wherein
this
power
is
perceived
to
exert
itself
now
as
these
instances
can
never
be
discovered
in
body
the
cartesians
proceeding
upon
their
principle
of
innate
ideas
have
had
recourse
to
a
supreme
spirit
or
deity
whom
they
consider
as
the
only
active
being
in
the
universe
and
as
the
immediate
cause
of
every
alteration
in
matter
but
the
principle
of
innate
ideas
being
allowed
to
be
false
it
follows
that
the
supposition
of
a
deity
can
serve
us
in
no
stead
in
accounting
for
that
idea
of
agency
which
we
search
for
in
vain
in
all
the
objects
which
are
presented
to
our
senses
or
which
we
are
internally
conscious
of
in
our
own
minds
for
if
every
idea
be
derived
from
an
impression
the
idea
of
a
deity
proceeds
from
the
same
origin
and
if
no
impression
either
of
sensation
or
reflection
implies
any
force
or
efficacy
it
is
equally
impossible
to
discover
or
even
imagine
any
such
active
principle
in
the
deity
since
these
philosophers
therefore
have
concluded
that
matter
can
not
be
endowed
with
any
efficacious
principle
because
it
is
impossible
to
discover
in
it
such
a
principle
the
same
course
of
reasoning
should
determine
them
to
exclude
it
from
the
supreme
being
or
if
they
esteem
that
opinion
absurd
and
impious
as
it
really
is
i
shall
tell
them
how
they
may
avoid
it
and
that
is
by
concluding
from
the
very
first
that
they
have
no
adequate
idea
of
power
or
efficacy
in
any
object
since
neither
in
body
nor
spirit
neither
in
superior
nor
inferior
natures
are
they
able
to
discover
one
single
instance
of
it
the
same
conclusion
is
unavoidable
upon
the
hypothesis
of
those
who
maintain
the
efficacy
of
second
causes
and
attribute
a
derivative
but
a
real
power
and
energy
to
matter
for
as
they
confess
that
this
energy
lies
not
in
any
of
the
known
qualities
of
matter
the
difficulty
still
remains
concerning
the
origin
of
its
idea
if
we
have
really
an
idea
of
power
we
may
attribute
power
to
an
unknown
quality
but
as
it
is
impossible
that
that
idea
can
be
derived
from
such
a
quality
and
as
there
is
nothing
in
known
qualities
which
can
produce
it
it
follows
that
we
deceive
ourselves
when
we
imagine
we
are
possest
of
any
idea
of
this
kind
after
the
manner
we
commonly
understand
it
all
ideas
are
derived
from
and
represent
impressions
we
never
have
any
impression
that
contains
any
power
or
efficacy
we
never
therefore
have
any
idea
of
power
some
have
asserted
that
we
feel
an
energy
or
power
in
our
own
mind
and
that
having
in
this
manner
acquired
the
idea
of
power
we
transfer
that
quality
to
matter
where
we
are
not
able
immediately
to
discover
it
the
motions
of
our
body
and
the
thoughts
and
sentiments
of
our
mind
say
they
obey
the
will
nor
do
we
seek
any
farther
to
acquire
a
just
notion
of
force
or
power
but
to
convince
us
how
fallacious
this
reasoning
is
we
need
only
consider
that
the
will
being
here
considered
as
a
cause
has
no
more
a
discoverable
connexion
with
its
effects
than
any
material
cause
has
with
its
proper
effect
so
far
from
perceiving
the
connexion
betwixt
an
act
of
volition
and
a
motion
of
the
body
it
is
allowed
that
no
effect
is
more
inexplicable
from
the
powers
and
essence
of
thought
and
matter
nor
is
the
empire
of
the
will
over
our
mind
more
intelligible
the
effect
is
there
distinguishable
and
separable
from
the
cause
and
coued
not
be
foreseen
without
the
experience
of
their
constant
conjunction
we
have
command
over
our
mind
to
a
certain
degree
but
beyond
that
lose
all
empire
over
it
and
it
is
evidently
impossible
to
fix
any
precise
bounds
to
our
authority
where
we
consult
not
experience
in
short
the
actions
of
the
mind
are
in
this
respect
the
same
with
those
of
matter
we
perceive
only
their
constant
conjunction
nor
can
we
ever
reason
beyond
it
no
internal
impression
has
an
apparent
energy
more
than
external
objects
have
since
therefore
matter
is
confessed
by
philosophers
to
operate
by
an
unknown
force
we
should
in
vain
hope
to
attain
an
idea
of
force
by
consulting
our
own
minds
footnote
footnote
the
same
imperfection
attends
our
ideas
of
the
deity
but
this
can
have
no
effect
either
on
religion
or
morals
the
order
of
the
universe
proves
an
omnipotent
mind
that
is
a
mind
whose
wili
is
constantly
attended
with
the
obedience
of
every
creature
and
being
nothing
more
is
requisite
to
give
a
foundation
to
all
the
articles
of
religion
nor
is
it
necessary
we
shoud
form
a
distinct
idea
of
the
force
and
energy
of
the
supreme
being
it
has
been
established
as
a
certain
principle
that
general
or
abstract
ideas
are
nothing
but
individual
ones
taken
in
a
certain
light
and
that
in
reflecting
on
any
object
it
is
as
impossible
to
exclude
from
our
thought
all
particular
degrees
of
quantity
and
quality
as
from
the
real
nature
of
things
if
we
be
possest
therefore
of
any
idea
of
power
in
general
we
must
also
be
able
to
conceive
some
particular
species
of
it
and
as
power
can
not
subsist
alone
but
is
always
regarded
as
an
attribute
of
some
being
or
existence
we
must
be
able
to
place
this
power
in
some
particular
being
and
conceive
that
being
as
endowed
with
a
real
force
and
energy
by
which
such
a
particular
effect
necessarily
results
from
its
operation
we
must
distinctly
and
particularly
conceive
the
connexion
betwixt
the
cause
and
effect
and
be
able
to
pronounce
from
a
simple
view
of
the
one
that
it
must
be
followed
or
preceded
by
the
other
this
is
the
true
manner
of
conceiving
a
particular
power
in
a
particular
body
and
a
general
idea
being
impossible
without
an
individual
where
the
latter
is
impossible
it
is
certain
the
former
can
never
exist
now
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
the
human
mind
can
not
form
such
an
idea
of
two
objects
as
to
conceive
any
connexion
betwixt
them
or
comprehend
distinctly
that
power
or
efficacy
by
which
they
are
united
such
a
connexion
would
amount
to
a
demonstration
and
would
imply
the
absolute
impossibility
for
the
one
object
not
to
follow
or
to
be
conceived
not
to
follow
upon
the
other
which
kind
of
connexion
has
already
been
rejected
in
all
cases
if
any
one
is
of
a
contrary
opinion
and
thinks
he
has
attained
a
notion
of
power
in
any
particular
object
i
desire
he
may
point
out
to
me
that
object
but
till
i
meet
with
which
i
despair
of
i
can
not
forbear
concluding
that
since
we
can
never
distinctly
conceive
how
any
particular
power
can
possibly
reside
in
any
particular
object
we
deceive
ourselves
in
imagining
we
can
form
any
such
general
idea
thus
upon
the
whole
we
may
infer
that
when
we
talk
of
any
being
whether
of
a
superior
or
inferior
nature
as
endowed
with
a
power
or
force
proportioned
to
any
effect
when
we
speak
of
a
necessary
connexion
betwixt
objects
and
suppose
that
this
connexion
depends
upon
an
efficacy
or
energy
with
which
any
of
these
objects
are
endowed
in
all
these
expressions
so
applied
we
have
really
no
distinct
meaning
and
make
use
only
of
common
words
without
any
clear
and
determinate
ideas
but
as
it
is
more
probable
that
these
expressions
do
here
lose
their
true
meaning
by
being
wrong
applied
than
that
they
never
have
any
meaning
it
will
be
proper
to
bestow
another
consideration
on
this
subject
to
see
if
possibly
we
can
discover
the
nature
and
origin
of
those
ideas
we
annex
to
them
suppose
two
objects
to
be
presented
to
us
of
which
the
one
is
the
cause
and
the
other
the
effect
it
is
plain
that
from
the
simple
consideration
of
one
or
both
these
objects
we
never
shall
perceive
the
tie
by
which
they
are
united
or
be
able
certainly
to
pronounce
that
there
is
a
connexion
betwixt
them
it
is
not
therefore
from
any
one
instance
that
we
arrive
at
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
of
a
necessary
connexion
of
power
of
force
of
energy
and
of
efficacy
did
we
never
see
any
but
particular
conjunctions
of
objects
entirely
different
from
each
other
we
should
never
be
able
to
form
any
such
ideas
but
again
suppose
we
observe
several
instances
in
which
the
same
objects
are
always
conjoined
together
we
immediately
conceive
a
connexion
betwixt
them
and
begin
to
draw
an
inference
from
one
to
another
this
multiplicity
of
resembling
instances
therefore
constitutes
the
very
essence
of
power
or
connexion
and
is
the
source
from
which
the
idea
of
it
arises
in
order
then
to
understand
the
idea
of
power
we
must
consider
that
multiplicity
nor
do
i
ask
more
to
give
a
solution
of
that
difficulty
which
has
so
long
perplexed
us
for
thus
i
reason
the
repetition
of
perfectly
similar
instances
can
never
alone
give
rise
to
an
original
idea
different
from
what
is
to
be
found
in
any
particular
instance
as
has
been
observed
and
as
evidently
follows
from
our
fundamental
principle
that
all
ideas
are
copyed
from
impressions
since
therefore
the
idea
of
power
is
a
new
original
idea
not
to
be
found
in
any
one
instance
and
which
yet
arises
from
the
repetition
of
several
instances
it
follows
that
the
repetition
alone
has
not
that
effect
but
must
either
discover
or
produce
something
new
which
is
the
source
of
that
idea
did
the
repetition
neither
discover
nor
produce
anything
new
our
ideas
might
be
multiplyed
by
it
but
would
not
be
enlarged
above
what
they
are
upon
the
observation
of
one
single
instance
every
enlargement
therefore
such
as
the
idea
of
power
or
connexion
which
arises
from
the
multiplicity
of
similar
instances
is
copyed
from
some
effects
of
the
multiplicity
and
will
be
perfectly
understood
by
understanding
these
effects
wherever
we
find
anything
new
to
be
discovered
or
produced
by
the
repetition
there
we
must
place
the
power
and
must
never
look
for
it
in
any
other
object
but
it
is
evident
in
the
first
place
that
the
repetition
of
like
objects
in
like
relations
of
succession
and
contiguity
discovers
nothing
new
in
any
one
of
them
since
we
can
draw
no
inference
from
it
nor
make
it
a
subject
either
of
our
demonstrative
or
probable
reasonings
sect
as
has
been
already
proved
nay
suppose
we
coued
draw
an
inference
it
would
be
of
no
consequence
in
the
present
case
since
no
kind
of
reasoning
can
give
rise
to
a
new
idea
such
as
this
of
power
is
but
wherever
we
reason
we
must
antecedently
be
possest
of
clear
ideas
which
may
be
the
objects
of
our
reasoning
the
conception
always
precedes
the
understanding
and
where
the
one
is
obscure
the
other
is
uncertain
where
the
one
fails
the
other
must
fail
also
secondly
it
is
certain
that
this
repetition
of
similar
objects
in
similar
situations
produces
nothing
new
either
in
these
objects
or
in
any
external
body
for
it
will
readily
be
allowed
that
the
several
instances
we
have
of
the
conjunction
of
resembling
causes
and
effects
are
in
themselves
entirely
independent
and
that
the
communication
of
motion
which
i
see
result
at
present
from
the
shock
of
two
is
totally
distinct
from
that
which
i
saw
result
from
such
an
impulse
a
ago
these
impulses
have
no
influence
on
each
other
they
are
entirely
divided
by
time
and
place
and
the
one
might
have
existed
and
communicated
motion
though
the
other
never
had
been
in
being
there
is
then
nothing
new
either
discovered
or
produced
in
any
objects
by
their
constant
conjunction
and
by
the
uninterrupted
resemblance
of
their
relations
of
succession
and
contiguity
but
it
is
from
this
resemblance
that
the
ideas
of
necessity
of
power
and
of
efficacy
are
derived
these
ideas
therefore
represent
not
anything
that
does
or
can
belong
to
the
objects
which
are
constantly
conjoined
this
is
an
argument
which
in
every
view
we
can
examine
it
will
be
found
perfectly
unanswerable
similar
instances
are
still
the
first
source
of
our
idea
of
power
or
necessity
at
the
same
time
that
they
have
no
influence
by
their
similarity
either
on
each
other
or
on
any
external
object
we
must
therefore
turn
ourselves
to
some
other
quarter
to
seek
the
origin
of
that
idea
though
the
several
resembling
instances
which
give
rise
to
the
idea
of
power
have
no
influence
on
each
other
and
can
never
produce
any
new
quality
in
the
object
which
can
be
the
model
of
that
idea
yet
the
observation
of
this
resemblance
produces
a
new
impression
in
the
mind
which
is
its
real
model
for
after
we
have
observed
the
resemblance
in
a
sufficient
number
of
instances
we
immediately
feel
a
determination
of
the
mind
to
pass
from
one
object
to
its
usual
attendant
and
to
conceive
it
in
a
stronger
light
upon
account
of
that
relation
this
determination
is
the
only
effect
of
the
resemblance
and
therefore
must
be
the
same
with
power
or
efficacy
whose
idea
is
derived
from
the
resemblance
the
several
instances
of
resembling
conjunctions
lead
us
into
the
notion
of
power
and
necessity
these
instances
are
in
themselves
totally
distinct
from
each
other
and
have
no
union
but
in
the
mind
which
observes
them
and
collects
their
ideas
necessity
then
is
the
effect
of
this
observation
and
is
nothing
but
an
internal
impression
of
the
mind
or
a
determination
to
carry
our
thoughts
from
one
object
to
another
without
considering
it
in
this
view
we
can
never
arrive
at
the
most
distant
notion
of
it
or
be
able
to
attribute
it
either
to
external
or
internal
objects
to
spirit
or
body
to
causes
or
effects
the
necessary
connexion
betwixt
causes
and
effects
is
the
foundation
of
our
inference
from
one
to
the
other
the
foundation
of
our
inference
is
the
transition
arising
from
the
accustomed
union
these
are
therefore
the
same
the
idea
of
necessity
arises
from
some
impression
there
is
no
impression
conveyed
by
our
senses
which
can
give
rise
to
that
idea
it
must
therefore
be
derived
from
some
internal
impression
or
impression
of
reflection
there
is
no
internal
impression
which
has
any
relation
to
the
present
business
but
that
propensity
which
custom
produces
to
pass
from
an
object
to
the
idea
of
its
usual
attendant
this
therefore
is
the
essence
of
necessity
upon
the
whole
necessity
is
something
that
exists
in
the
mind
not
in
objects
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
ever
to
form
the
most
distant
idea
of
it
considered
as
a
quality
in
bodies
either
we
have
no
idea
of
necessity
or
necessity
is
nothing
but
that
determination
of
the
thought
to
pass
from
causes
to
effects
and
from
effects
to
causes
according
to
their
experienced
union
thus
as
the
necessity
which
makes
two
times
two
equal
to
four
or
three
angles
of
a
triangle
equal
to
two
right
ones
lies
only
in
the
act
of
the
understanding
by
which
we
consider
and
compare
these
ideas
in
like
manner
the
necessity
or
power
which
unites
causes
and
effects
lies
in
the
determination
of
the
mind
to
pass
from
the
one
to
the
other
the
efficacy
or
energy
of
causes
is
neither
placed
in
the
causes
themselves
nor
in
the
deity
nor
in
the
concurrence
of
these
two
principles
but
belongs
entirely
to
the
soul
which
considers
the
union
of
two
or
more
objects
in
all
past
instances
it
is
here
that
the
real
power
of
causes
is
placed
along
with
their
connexion
and
necessity
i
am
sensible
that
of
all
the
paradoxes
which
i
have
had
or
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
advance
in
the
course
of
this
treatise
the
present
one
is
the
most
violent
and
that
it
is
merely
by
dint
of
solid
proof
and
reasoning
i
can
ever
hope
it
will
have
admission
and
overcome
the
inveterate
prejudices
of
mankind
before
we
are
reconciled
to
this
doctrine
how
often
must
we
repeat
to
ourselves
that
the
simple
view
of
any
two
objects
or
actions
however
related
can
never
give
us
any
idea
of
power
or
of
a
connexion
betwixt
them
that
this
idea
arises
from
the
repetition
of
their
union
that
the
repetition
neither
discovers
nor
causes
any
thing
in
the
objects
but
has
an
influence
only
on
the
mind
by
that
customary
transition
it
produces
that
this
customary
transition
is
therefore
the
same
with
the
power
and
necessity
which
are
consequently
qualities
of
perceptions
not
of
objects
and
are
internally
felt
by
the
soul
and
not
perceivd
externally
in
bodies
there
is
commonly
an
astonishment
attending
every
thing
extraordinary
and
this
astonishment
changes
immediately
into
the
highest
degree
of
esteem
or
contempt
according
as
we
approve
or
disapprove
of
the
subject
i
am
much
afraid
that
though
the
foregoing
reasoning
appears
to
me
the
shortest
and
most
decisive
imaginable
yet
with
the
generality
of
readers
the
biass
of
the
mind
will
prevail
and
give
them
a
prejudice
against
the
present
doctrine
this
contrary
biass
is
easily
accounted
for
it
is
a
common
observation
that
the
mind
has
a
great
propensity
to
spread
itself
on
external
objects
and
to
conjoin
with
them
any
internal
impressions
which
they
occasion
and
which
always
make
their
appearance
at
the
same
time
that
these
objects
discover
themselves
to
the
senses
thus
as
certain
sounds
and
smells
are
always
found
to
attend
certain
visible
objects
we
naturally
imagine
a
conjunction
even
in
place
betwixt
the
objects
and
qualities
though
the
qualities
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
admit
of
no
such
conjunction
and
really
exist
no
where
but
of
this
more
fully
hereafter
part
iv
sect
mean
while
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
the
same
propensity
is
the
reason
why
we
suppose
necessity
and
power
to
lie
in
the
objects
we
consider
not
in
our
mind
that
considers
them
notwithstanding
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
form
the
most
distant
idea
of
that
quality
when
it
is
not
taken
for
the
determination
of
the
mind
to
pass
from
the
idea
of
an
object
to
that
of
its
usual
attendant
but
though
this
be
the
only
reasonable
account
we
can
give
of
necessity
the
contrary
notion
if
so
riveted
in
the
mind
from
the
principles
that
i
doubt
not
but
my
sentiments
will
be
treated
by
many
as
extravagant
and
ridiculous
what
the
efficacy
of
causes
lie
in
the
determination
of
the
mind
as
if
causes
did
not
operate
entirely
independent
of
the
mind
and
would
not
continue
their
operation
even
though
there
was
no
mind
existent
to
contemplate
them
or
reason
concerning
them
thought
may
well
depend
on
causes
for
its
operation
but
not
causes
on
thought
this
is
to
reverse
the
order
of
nature
and
make
that
secondary
which
is
really
primary
to
every
operation
there
is
a
power
proportioned
and
this
power
must
be
placed
on
the
body
that
operates
if
we
remove
the
power
from
one
cause
we
must
ascribe
it
to
another
but
to
remove
it
from
all
causes
and
bestow
it
on
a
being
that
is
no
ways
related
to
the
cause
or
effect
but
by
perceiving
them
is
a
gross
absurdity
and
contrary
to
the
most
certain
principles
of
human
reason
i
can
only
reply
to
all
these
arguments
that
the
case
is
here
much
the
same
as
if
a
blind
man
should
pretend
to
find
a
great
many
absurdities
in
the
supposition
that
the
colour
of
scarlet
is
not
the
same
with
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
nor
light
the
same
with
solidity
if
we
have
really
no
idea
of
a
power
or
efficacy
in
any
object
or
of
any
real
connexion
betwixt
causes
and
effects
it
will
be
to
little
purpose
to
prove
that
an
efficacy
is
necessary
in
all
operations
we
do
not
understand
our
own
meaning
in
talking
so
but
ignorantly
confound
ideas
which
are
entirely
distinct
from
each
other
i
am
indeed
ready
to
allow
that
there
may
be
several
qualities
both
in
material
and
immaterial
objects
with
which
we
are
utterly
unacquainted
and
if
we
please
to
call
these
power
or
efficacy
it
will
be
of
little
consequence
to
the
world
but
when
instead
of
meaning
these
unknown
qualities
we
make
the
terms
of
power
and
efficacy
signify
something
of
which
we
have
a
clear
idea
and
which
is
incompatible
with
those
objects
to
which
we
apply
it
obscurity
and
error
begin
then
to
take
place
and
we
are
led
astray
by
a
false
philosophy
this
is
the
case
when
we
transfer
the
determination
of
the
thought
to
external
objects
and
suppose
any
real
intelligible
connexion
betwixt
them
that
being
a
quality
which
can
only
belong
to
the
mind
that
considers
them
as
to
what
may
be
said
that
the
operations
of
nature
are
independent
of
our
thought
and
reasoning
i
allow
it
and
accordingly
have
observed
that
objects
bear
to
each
other
the
relations
of
contiguity
and
succession
that
like
objects
may
be
observed
in
several
instances
to
have
like
relations
and
that
all
this
is
independent
of
and
antecedent
to
the
operations
of
the
understanding
but
if
we
go
any
farther
and
ascribe
a
power
or
necessary
connexion
to
these
objects
this
is
what
we
can
never
observe
in
them
but
must
draw
the
idea
of
it
from
what
we
feel
internally
in
contemplating
them
and
this
i
carry
so
far
that
i
am
ready
to
convert
my
present
reasoning
into
an
instance
of
it
by
a
subtility
which
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
comprehend
when
any
object
is
presented
to
us
it
immediately
conveys
to
the
mind
a
lively
idea
of
that
object
which
is
usually
found
to
attend
it
and
this
determination
of
the
mind
forms
the
necessary
connexion
of
these
objects
but
when
we
change
the
point
of
view
from
the
objects
to
the
perceptions
in
that
case
the
impression
is
to
be
considered
as
the
cause
and
the
lively
idea
as
the
effect
and
their
necessary
connexion
is
that
new
determination
which
we
feel
to
pass
from
the
idea
of
the
one
to
that
of
the
other
the
uniting
principle
among
our
internal
perceptions
is
as
unintelligible
as
that
among
external
objects
and
is
not
known
to
us
any
other
way
than
by
experience
now
the
nature
and
effects
of
experience
have
been
already
sufficiently
examined
and
explained
it
never
gives
us
any
insight
into
the
internal
structure
or
operating
principle
of
objects
but
only
accustoms
the
mind
to
pass
from
one
to
another
it
is
now
time
to
collect
all
the
different
parts
of
this
reasoning
and
by
joining
them
together
form
an
exact
definition
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
which
makes
the
subject
of
the
present
enquiry
this
order
would
not
have
been
excusable
of
first
examining
our
inference
from
the
relation
before
we
had
explained
the
relation
itself
had
it
been
possible
to
proceed
in
a
different
method
but
as
the
nature
of
the
relation
depends
so
much
on
that
of
the
inference
we
have
been
obliged
to
advance
in
this
seemingly
preposterous
manner
and
make
use
of
terms
before
we
were
able
exactly
to
define
them
or
fix
their
meaning
we
shall
now
correct
this
fault
by
giving
a
precise
definition
of
cause
and
effect
there
may
two
definitions
be
given
of
this
relation
which
are
only
different
by
their
presenting
a
different
view
of
the
same
object
and
making
us
consider
it
either
as
a
philosophical
or
as
a
natural
relation
either
as
a
comparison
of
two
ideas
or
as
an
association
betwixt
them
we
may
define
a
cause
to
be
an
object
precedent
and
contiguous
to
another
and
where
all
the
objects
resembling
the
former
are
placed
in
like
relations
of
precedency
and
contiguity
to
those
objects
that
resemble
the
latter
i
if
this
definition
be
esteemed
defective
because
drawn
from
objects
foreign
to
the
cause
we
may
substitute
this
other
definition
in
its
place
viz
a
cause
is
an
object
precedent
and
contiguous
to
another
and
so
united
with
it
that
the
idea
of
the
one
determines
the
mind
to
form
the
idea
of
the
other
and
the
impression
of
the
one
to
form
a
more
lively
idea
of
the
other
should
this
definition
also
be
rejected
for
the
same
reason
i
know
no
other
remedy
than
that
the
persons
who
express
this
delicacy
should
substitute
a
juster
definition
in
its
place
but
for
my
part
i
must
own
my
incapacity
for
such
an
undertaking
when
i
examine
with
the
utmost
accuracy
those
objects
which
are
commonly
denominated
causes
and
effects
i
find
in
considering
a
single
instance
that
the
one
object
is
precedent
and
contiguous
to
the
other
and
in
inlarging
my
view
to
consider
several
instances
i
find
only
that
like
objects
are
constantly
placed
in
like
relations
of
succession
and
contiguity
again
when
i
consider
the
influence
of
this
constant
conjunction
i
perceive
that
such
a
relation
can
never
be
an
object
of
reasoning
and
can
never
operate
upon
the
mind
but
by
means
of
custom
which
determines
the
imagination
to
make
a
transition
from
the
idea
of
one
object
to
that
of
its
usual
attendant
and
from
the
impression
of
one
to
a
more
lively
idea
of
the
other
however
extraordinary
these
sentiments
may
appear
i
think
it
fruitless
to
trouble
myself
with
any
farther
enquiry
or
reasoning
upon
the
subject
but
shall
repose
myself
on
them
as
on
established
maxims
it
will
only
be
proper
before
we
leave
this
subject
to
draw
some
corrollaries
from
it
by
which
we
may
remove
several
prejudices
and
popular
errors
that
have
very
much
prevailed
in
philosophy
first
we
may
learn
from
the
foregoing
doctrine
that
all
causes
are
of
the
same
kind
and
that
in
particular
there
is
no
foundation
for
that
distinction
which
we
sometimes
make
betwixt
efficient
causes
and
causes
sine
qua
non
or
betwixt
efficient
causes
and
formal
and
material
and
exemplary
and
final
causes
for
as
our
idea
of
efficiency
is
derived
from
the
constant
conjunction
of
two
objects
wherever
this
is
observed
the
cause
is
efficient
and
where
it
is
not
there
can
never
be
a
cause
of
any
kind
for
the
same
reason
we
must
reject
the
distinction
betwixt
cause
and
occasion
when
supposed
to
signify
any
thing
essentially
different
from
each
other
if
constant
conjunction
be
implyed
in
what
we
call
occasion
it
is
a
real
cause
if
not
it
is
no
relation
at
all
and
can
not
give
rise
to
any
argument
or
reasoning
secondly
the
same
course
of
reasoning
will
make
us
conclude
that
there
is
but
one
kind
of
necessity
as
there
is
but
one
kind
of
cause
and
that
the
common
distinction
betwixt
moral
and
physical
necessity
is
without
any
foundation
in
nature
this
clearly
appears
from
the
precedent
explication
of
necessity
it
is
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
along
with
the
determination
of
the
mind
which
constitutes
a
physical
necessity
and
the
removal
of
these
is
the
same
thing
with
chance
as
objects
must
either
be
conjoined
or
not
and
as
the
mind
must
either
be
determined
or
not
to
pass
from
one
object
to
another
it
is
impossible
to
admit
of
any
medium
betwixt
chance
and
an
absolute
necessity
in
weakening
this
conjunction
and
determination
you
do
not
change
the
nature
of
the
necessity
since
even
in
the
operation
of
bodies
these
have
different
degrees
of
constancy
and
force
without
producing
a
different
species
of
that
relation
the
distinction
which
we
often
make
betwixt
power
and
the
exercise
of
it
is
equally
without
foundation
thirdly
we
may
now
be
able
fully
to
overcome
all
that
repugnance
which
it
is
so
natural
for
us
to
entertain
against
the
foregoing
reasoning
by
which
we
endeavoured
to
prove
that
the
necessity
of
a
cause
to
every
beginning
of
existence
is
not
founded
on
any
arguments
either
demonstrative
or
intuitive
such
an
opinion
will
not
appear
strange
after
the
foregoing
definitions
if
we
define
a
cause
to
be
an
object
precedent
and
contiguous
to
another
and
where
all
the
objects
resembling
the
farmer
are
placed
in
a
like
relation
of
priority
and
contiguity
to
those
objects
that
resemble
the
latter
we
may
easily
conceive
that
there
is
no
absolute
nor
metaphysical
necessity
that
every
beginning
of
existence
should
be
attended
with
such
an
object
if
we
define
a
cause
to
be
an
object
precedent
and
contiguous
to
another
and
so
united
with
it
in
the
imagination
that
the
idea
of
the
one
determines
the
mind
to
form
the
idea
of
the
other
and
the
impression
of
the
one
to
form
a
more
lively
idea
of
the
other
we
shall
make
still
less
difficulty
of
assenting
to
this
opinion
such
an
influence
on
the
mind
is
in
itself
perfectly
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
nor
can
we
be
certain
of
its
reality
but
from
experience
and
observation
i
shall
add
as
a
fourth
corrollary
that
we
can
never
have
reason
to
believe
that
any
object
exists
of
which
we
can
not
form
an
idea
for
as
all
our
reasonings
concerning
existence
are
derived
from
causation
and
as
all
our
reasonings
concerning
causation
are
derived
from
the
experienced
conjunction
of
objects
not
from
any
reasoning
or
reflection
the
same
experience
must
give
us
a
notion
of
these
objects
and
must
remove
all
mystery
from
our
conclusions
this
is
so
evident
that
it
would
scarce
have
merited
our
attention
were
it
not
to
obviate
certain
objections
of
this
kind
which
might
arise
against
the
following
reasonings
concerning
matter
and
substance
i
need
not
observe
that
a
full
knowledge
of
the
object
is
not
requisite
but
only
of
those
qualities
of
it
which
we
believe
to
exist
sect
xv
rules
by
which
to
judge
of
causes
and
effects
according
to
the
precedent
doctrine
there
are
no
objects
which
by
the
mere
survey
without
consulting
experience
we
can
determine
to
be
the
causes
of
any
other
and
no
objects
which
we
can
certainly
determine
in
the
same
manner
not
to
be
the
causes
any
thing
may
produce
any
thing
creation
annihilation
motion
reason
volition
all
these
may
arise
from
one
another
or
from
any
other
object
we
can
imagine
nor
will
this
appear
strange
if
we
compare
two
principles
explained
above
that
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
determines
their
causation
and
part
sect
that
property
speaking
no
objects
are
contrary
to
each
other
but
existence
and
where
objects
are
not
contrary
nothing
hinders
them
from
having
that
constant
conjunction
on
which
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
totally
depends
since
therefore
it
is
possible
for
all
objects
to
become
causes
or
effects
to
each
other
it
may
be
proper
to
fix
some
general
rules
by
which
we
may
know
when
they
really
are
so
the
cause
and
effect
must
be
contiguous
in
space
and
time
the
cause
must
be
prior
to
the
effect
there
must
be
a
constant
union
betwixt
the
cause
and
effect
it
is
chiefly
this
quality
that
constitutes
the
relation
the
same
cause
always
produces
the
same
effect
and
the
same
effect
never
arises
but
from
the
same
cause
this
principle
we
derive
from
experience
and
is
the
source
of
most
of
our
philosophical
reasonings
for
when
by
any
clear
experiment
we
have
discovered
the
causes
or
effects
of
any
phaenomenon
we
immediately
extend
our
observation
to
every
phenomenon
of
the
same
kind
without
waiting
for
that
constant
repetition
from
which
the
first
idea
of
this
relation
is
derived
there
is
another
principle
which
hangs
upon
this
viz
that
where
several
different
objects
produce
the
same
effect
it
must
be
by
means
of
some
quality
which
we
discover
to
be
common
amongst
them
for
as
like
effects
imply
like
causes
we
must
always
ascribe
the
causation
to
the
circumstance
wherein
we
discover
the
resemblance
the
following
principle
is
founded
on
the
same
reason
the
difference
in
the
effects
of
two
resembling
objects
must
proceed
from
that
particular
in
which
they
differ
for
as
like
causes
always
produce
like
effects
when
in
any
instance
we
find
our
expectation
to
be
disappointed
we
must
conclude
that
this
irregularity
proceeds
from
some
difference
in
the
causes
when
any
object
encreases
or
diminishes
with
the
encrease
or
diminution
of
its
cause
it
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
compounded
effect
derived
from
the
union
of
the
several
different
effects
which
arise
from
the
several
different
parts
of
the
cause
the
absence
or
presence
of
one
part
of
the
cause
is
here
supposed
to
be
always
attended
with
the
absence
or
presence
of
a
proportionable
part
of
the
effect
this
constant
conjunction
sufficiently
proves
that
the
one
part
is
the
cause
of
the
other
we
must
however
beware
not
to
draw
such
a
conclusion
from
a
few
experiments
a
certain
degree
of
heat
gives
pleasure
if
you
diminish
that
heat
the
pleasure
diminishes
but
it
does
not
follow
that
if
you
augment
it
beyond
a
certain
degree
the
pleasure
will
likewise
augment
for
we
find
that
it
degenerates
into
pain
the
eighth
and
last
rule
i
shall
take
notice
of
is
that
an
object
which
exists
for
any
time
in
its
full
perfection
without
any
effect
is
not
the
sole
cause
of
that
effect
but
requires
to
be
assisted
by
some
other
principle
which
may
forward
its
influence
and
operation
for
as
like
effects
necessarily
follow
from
like
causes
and
in
a
contiguous
time
and
place
their
separation
for
a
moment
shews
that
these
causes
are
not
compleat
ones
here
is
all
the
logic
i
think
proper
to
employ
in
my
reasoning
and
perhaps
even
this
was
not
very
necessary
but
might
have
been
supplyd
by
the
natural
principles
of
our
understanding
our
scholastic
and
logicians
shew
no
such
superiority
above
the
mere
vulgar
in
their
reason
and
ability
as
to
give
us
any
inclination
to
imitate
them
in
delivering
a
long
system
of
rules
and
precepts
to
direct
our
judgment
in
philosophy
all
the
rules
of
this
nature
are
very
easy
in
their
invention
but
extremely
difficult
in
their
application
and
even
experimental
philosophy
which
seems
the
most
natural
and
simple
of
any
requires
the
utmost
stretch
of
human
judgment
there
is
no
phaenomenon
in
nature
but
what
is
compounded
and
modifyd
by
so
many
different
circumstances
that
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
decisive
point
we
must
carefully
separate
whatever
is
superfluous
and
enquire
by
new
experiments
if
every
particular
circumstance
of
the
first
experiment
was
essential
to
it
these
new
experiments
are
liable
to
a
discussion
of
the
same
kind
so
that
the
utmost
constancy
is
requird
to
make
us
persevere
in
our
enquiry
and
the
utmost
sagacity
to
choose
the
right
way
among
so
many
that
present
themselves
if
this
be
the
case
even
in
natural
philosophy
how
much
more
in
moral
where
there
is
a
much
greater
complication
of
circumstances
and
where
those
views
and
sentiments
which
are
essential
to
any
action
of
the
mind
are
so
implicit
and
obscure
that
they
often
escape
our
strictest
attention
and
are
not
only
unaccountable
in
their
causes
but
even
unknown
in
their
existence
i
am
much
afraid
lest
the
small
success
i
meet
with
in
my
enquiries
will
make
this
observation
bear
the
air
of
an
apology
rather
than
of
boasting
if
any
thing
can
give
me
security
in
this
particular
it
will
be
the
enlarging
of
the
sphere
of
my
experiments
as
much
as
possible
for
which
reason
it
may
be
proper
in
this
place
to
examine
the
reasoning
faculty
of
brutes
as
well
as
that
of
human
creatures
sect
xvi
of
the
reason
of
animals
next
to
the
ridicule
of
denying
an
evident
truth
is
that
of
taking
much
pains
to
defend
it
and
no
truth
appears
to
me
more
evident
than
that
beasts
are
endowd
with
thought
and
reason
as
well
as
men
the
arguments
are
in
this
case
so
obvious
that
they
never
escape
the
most
stupid
and
ignorant
we
are
conscious
that
we
ourselves
in
adapting
means
to
ends
are
guided
by
reason
and
design
and
that
it
is
not
ignorantly
nor
casually
we
perform
those
actions
which
tend
to
to
the
obtaining
pleasure
and
avoiding
pain
when
therefore
we
see
other
creatures
in
millions
of
instances
perform
like
actions
and
direct
them
to
the
ends
all
our
principles
of
reason
and
probability
carry
us
with
an
invincible
force
to
believe
the
existence
of
a
like
cause
it
is
needless
in
my
opinion
to
illustrate
this
argument
by
the
enumeration
of
particulars
the
smallest
attention
will
supply
us
with
more
than
are
requisite
the
resemblance
betwixt
the
actions
of
animals
and
those
of
men
is
so
entire
in
this
respect
that
the
very
first
action
of
the
first
animal
we
shall
please
to
pitch
on
will
afford
us
an
incontestable
argument
for
the
present
doctrine
this
doctrine
is
as
useful
as
it
is
obvious
and
furnishes
us
with
a
kind
of
touchstone
by
which
we
may
try
every
system
in
this
species
of
philosophy
it
is
from
the
resemblance
of
the
external
actions
of
animals
to
those
we
ourselves
perform
that
we
judge
their
internal
likewise
to
resemble
ours
and
the
same
principle
of
reasoning
carryd
one
step
farther
will
make
us
conclude
that
since
our
internal
actions
resemble
each
other
the
causes
from
which
they
are
derivd
must
also
be
resembling
when
any
hypothesis
therefore
is
advancd
to
explain
a
mental
operation
which
is
common
to
men
and
beasts
we
must
apply
the
same
hypothesis
to
both
and
as
every
true
hypothesis
will
abide
this
trial
so
i
may
venture
to
affirm
that
no
false
one
will
ever
be
able
to
endure
it
the
common
defect
of
those
systems
which
philosophers
have
employd
to
account
for
the
actions
of
the
mind
is
that
they
suppose
such
a
subtility
and
refinement
of
thought
as
not
only
exceeds
the
capacity
of
mere
animals
but
even
of
children
and
the
common
people
in
our
own
species
who
are
notwithstanding
susceptible
of
the
same
emotions
and
affections
as
persons
of
the
most
accomplishd
genius
and
understanding
such
a
subtility
is
a
dear
proof
of
the
falshood
as
the
contrary
simplicity
of
the
truth
of
any
system
let
us
therefore
put
our
present
system
concerning
the
nature
of
the
understanding
to
this
decisive
trial
and
see
whether
it
will
equally
account
for
the
reasonings
of
beasts
as
for
these
of
the
human
species
here
we
must
make
a
distinction
betwixt
those
actions
of
animals
which
are
of
a
vulgar
nature
and
seem
to
be
on
a
level
with
their
common
capacities
and
those
more
extraordinary
instances
of
sagacity
which
they
sometimes
discover
for
their
own
preservation
and
the
propagation
of
their
species
a
dog
that
avoids
fire
and
precipices
that
shuns
strangers
and
caresses
his
master
affords
us
an
instance
of
the
first
kind
a
bird
that
chooses
with
such
care
and
nicety
the
place
and
materials
of
her
nest
and
sits
upon
her
eggs
for
a
due
time
and
in
suitable
season
with
all
the
precaution
that
a
chymist
is
capable
of
in
the
most
delicate
projection
furnishes
us
with
a
lively
instance
of
the
second
as
to
the
former
actions
i
assert
they
proceed
from
a
reasoning
that
is
not
in
itself
different
nor
founded
on
different
principles
from
that
which
appears
in
human
nature
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
that
there
be
some
impression
immediately
present
to
their
memory
or
senses
in
order
to
be
the
foundation
of
their
judgment
from
the
tone
of
voice
the
dog
infers
his
masters
anger
and
foresees
his
own
punishment
from
a
certain
sensation
affecting
his
smell
he
judges
his
game
not
to
be
far
distant
from
him
secondly
the
inference
he
draws
from
the
present
impression
is
built
on
experience
and
on
his
observation
of
the
conjunction
of
objects
in
past
instances
as
you
vary
this
experience
he
varies
his
reasoning
make
a
beating
follow
upon
one
sign
or
motion
for
some
time
and
afterwards
upon
another
and
he
will
successively
draw
different
conclusions
according
to
his
most
recent
experience
now
let
any
philosopher
make
a
trial
and
endeavour
to
explain
that
act
of
the
mind
which
we
call
belief
and
give
an
account
of
the
principles
from
which
it
is
derivd
independent
of
the
influence
of
custom
on
the
imagination
and
let
his
hypothesis
be
equally
applicable
to
beasts
as
to
the
human
species
and
after
he
has
done
this
i
promise
to
embrace
his
opinion
but
at
the
same
time
i
demand
as
an
equitable
condition
that
if
my
system
be
the
only
one
which
can
answer
to
all
these
terms
it
may
be
receivd
as
entirely
satisfactory
and
convincing
and
that
it
is
the
only
one
is
evident
almost
without
any
reasoning
beasts
certainly
never
perceive
any
real
connexion
among
objects
it
is
therefore
by
experience
they
infer
one
from
another
they
can
never
by
any
arguments
form
a
general
conclusion
that
those
objects
of
which
they
have
had
no
experience
resemble
those
of
which
they
have
it
is
therefore
by
means
of
custom
alone
that
experience
operates
upon
them
all
this
was
sufficiently
evident
with
respect
to
man
but
with
respect
to
beasts
there
can
not
be
the
least
suspicion
of
mistake
which
must
be
ownd
to
be
a
strong
confirmation
or
rather
an
invincible
proof
of
my
system
nothing
shews
more
the
force
of
habit
in
reconciling
us
to
any
phaenomenoun
than
this
that
men
are
not
astonished
at
the
operations
of
their
own
reason
at
the
same
time
that
they
admire
the
instinct
of
animals
and
find
a
difficulty
in
explaining
it
merely
because
it
can
not
be
reducd
tothe
very
same
principles
to
consider
the
matter
aright
reason
is
nothing
but
a
wonderful
and
unintelligible
instinct
in
our
souls
which
carries
us
along
a
certain
train
of
ideas
and
endows
them
with
particular
qualities
according
to
their
particular
situations
and
relations
this
instinct
it
is
true
arises
from
past
observation
and
experience
but
can
any
one
give
the
ultimate
reason
why
past
experience
and
observation
produces
such
an
effect
any
more
than
why
nature
alone
shoud
produce
it
nature
may
certainly
produce
whatever
can
arise
from
habit
nay
habit
is
nothing
but
one
of
the
principles
of
nature
and
derives
all
its
force
from
that
origin

iv
of
the
sceptical
and
other
systems
of
philosophy
sect
i
of
scepticism
with
regard
to
reason
in
all
demonstrative
sciences
the
rules
are
certain
and
infallible
but
when
we
apply
them
our
fallible
said
uncertain
faculties
are
very
apt
to
depart
from
them
and
fall
into
error
we
must
therefore
in
every
reasoning
form
a
new
judgment
as
a
check
or
controul
on
our
first
judgment
or
belief
and
must
enlarge
our
view
to
comprehend
a
kind
of
history
of
all
the
instances
wherein
our
understanding
has
deceived
us
compared
with
those
wherein
its
testimony
was
just
and
true
our
reason
must
be
considered
as
a
kind
of
cause
of
which
truth
is
the
natural
effect
but
as
by
the
irruption
of
other
causes
and
by
the
inconstancy
of
our
mental
powers
may
frequently
be
prevented
by
this
means
all
knowledge
degenerates
into
probability
and
this
probability
is
greater
or
less
according
to
our
experience
of
the
veracity
or
deceitfulness
of
our
understanding
and
according
to
the
simplicity
or
intricacy
of
the
question
there
is
no
algebraist
nor
mathematician
so
expert
in
his
science
as
to
place
entire
confidence
in
any
truth
immediately
upon
his
discovery
of
it
or
regard
it
as
any
thing
but
a
were
probability
every
time
he
runs
over
his
proofs
his
confidence
encreases
but
still
more
by
the
approbation
of
his
friends
and
is
raised
to
its
utmost
perfection
by
the
universal
assent
and
applauses
of
the
learned
world
now
it
is
evident
that
this
gradual
encrease
of
assurance
is
nothing
but
the
addition
of
new
probabilities
and
is
derived
from
the
constant
union
of
causes
and
effects
according
to
past
experience
and
observation
in
accompts
of
any
length
or
importance
merchants
seldom
trust
to
the
infallible
certainty
of
numbers
for
their
security
but
by
the
artificial
structure
of
the
accompts
produce
a
probability
beyond
what
is
derived
from
the
skill
and
experience
of
the
accomptant
for
that
is
plainly
of
itself
some
degree
of
probability
though
uncertain
and
variable
according
to
the
degrees
of
his
experience
and
length
of
the
accompt
now
as
none
will
maintain
that
our
assurance
in
a
long
numeration
exceeds
probability
i
may
safely
affirm
that
there
scarce
is
any
proposition
concerning
numbers
of
which
we
can
have
a
fuller
security
for
it
is
easily
possible
by
gradually
diminishing
the
numbers
to
reduce
the
longest
series
of
addition
to
the
most
simple
question
which
can
be
formed
to
an
addition
of
two
single
numbers
and
upon
this
supposition
we
shall
find
it
impracticable
to
shew
the
precise
limits
of
knowledge
and
of
probability
or
discover
that
particular
number
at
which
the
one
ends
and
the
other
begins
but
knowledge
and
probability
are
of
such
contrary
and
disagreeing
natures
that
they
can
not
well
run
insensibly
into
each
other
and
that
because
they
will
not
divide
but
must
be
either
entirely
present
or
entirely
absent
besides
if
any
single
addition
were
certain
every
one
would
be
so
and
consequently
the
whole
or
total
sum
unless
the
whole
can
be
different
from
all
its
parts
i
had
almost
said
that
this
was
certain
but
i
reflect
that
it
must
reduce
itself
as
well
as
every
other
reasoning
and
from
knowledge
degenerate
into
probability
since
therefore
all
knowledge
resolves
itself
into
probability
and
becomes
at
last
of
the
same
nature
with
that
evidence
which
we
employ
in
common
life
we
must
now
examine
this
latter
species
of
reasoning
and
see
on
what
foundation
it
stands
in
every
judgment
which
we
can
form
concerning
probability
as
well
as
concerning
knowledge
we
ought
always
to
correct
the
first
judgment
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
object
by
another
judgment
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
understanding
it
is
certain
a
man
of
solid
sense
and
long
experience
ought
to
have
and
usually
has
a
greater
assurance
in
his
opinions
than
one
that
is
foolish
and
ignorant
and
that
our
sentiments
have
different
degrees
of
authority
even
with
ourselves
in
proportion
to
the
degrees
of
our
reason
and
experience
in
the
man
of
the
best
sense
and
longest
experience
this
authority
is
never
entire
since
even
must
be
conscious
of
many
errors
in
the
past
and
must
still
dread
the
like
for
the
future
here
then
arises
a
new
species
of
probability
to
correct
and
regulate
the
first
and
fix
its
just
standard
and
proportion
as
demonstration
is
subject
to
the
controul
of
probability
so
is
probability
liable
to
a
new
correction
by
a
reflex
act
of
the
mind
wherein
the
nature
of
our
understanding
and
our
reasoning
from
the
first
probability
become
our
objects
having
thus
found
in
every
probability
beside
the
original
uncertainty
inherent
in
the
subject
a
new
uncertainty
derived
from
the
weakness
of
that
faculty
which
judges
and
having
adjusted
these
two
together
we
are
obliged
by
our
reason
to
add
a
new
doubt
derived
from
the
possibility
of
error
in
the
estimation
we
make
of
the
truth
and
fidelity
of
our
faculties
this
is
a
doubt
which
immediately
occurs
to
us
and
of
which
if
we
would
closely
pursue
our
reason
we
can
not
avoid
giving
a
decision
but
this
decision
though
it
should
be
favourable
to
our
preceding
judgment
being
founded
only
on
probability
must
weaken
still
further
our
first
evidence
and
must
itself
be
weakened
by
a
fourth
doubt
of
the
same
kind
and
so
on
in
infinitum
till
at
last
there
remain
nothing
of
the
original
probability
however
great
we
may
suppose
it
to
have
been
and
however
small
the
diminution
by
every
new
uncertainty
no
finite
object
can
subsist
under
a
decrease
repeated
in
infinitum
and
even
the
vastest
quantity
which
can
enter
into
human
imagination
must
in
this
manner
be
reduced
to
nothing
let
our
first
belief
be
never
so
strong
it
must
infallibly
perish
by
passing
through
so
many
new
examinations
of
which
each
diminishes
somewhat
of
its
force
and
vigour
when
i
reflect
on
the
natural
fallibility
of
my
judgment
i
have
less
confidence
in
my
opinions
than
when
i
only
consider
the
objects
concerning
which
i
reason
and
when
i
proceed
still
farther
to
turn
the
scrutiny
against
every
successive
estimation
i
make
of
my
faculties
all
the
rules
of
logic
require
a
continual
diminution
and
at
last
a
total
extinction
of
belief
and
evidence
should
it
here
be
asked
me
whether
i
sincerely
assent
to
this
argument
which
i
seem
to
take
such
pains
to
inculcate
and
whether
i
be
really
one
of
those
sceptics
who
hold
that
all
is
uncertain
and
that
our
judgment
is
not
in
any
thing
possest
of
any
measures
of
truth
and
falshood
i
should
reply
that
this
question
is
entirely
superfluous
and
that
neither
i
nor
any
other
person
was
ever
sincerely
and
constantly
of
that
opinion
nature
by
an
absolute
and
uncontroulable
necessity
has
determined
us
to
judge
as
well
as
to
breathe
and
feel
nor
can
we
any
more
forbear
viewing
certain
objects
in
a
stronger
and
fuller
light
upon
account
of
their
customary
connexion
with
a
present
impression
than
we
can
hinder
ourselves
from
thinking
as
long
as
we
are
awake
or
seeing
the
surrounding
bodies
when
we
turn
our
eyes
towards
them
in
broad
sunshine
whoever
has
taken
the
pains
to
refute
the
cavils
of
this
total
scepticism
has
really
disputed
without
an
antagonist
and
endeavoured
by
arguments
to
establish
a
faculty
which
nature
has
antecedently
implanted
in
the
mind
and
rendered
unavoidable
my
intention
then
in
displaying
so
carefully
the
arguments
of
that
fantastic
sect
is
only
to
make
the
reader
sensible
of
the
truth
of
my
hypothesis
that
all
our
reasonings
concerning
causes
and
effects
are
derived
from
nothing
but
custom
and
that
belief
is
more
properly
an
act
of
the
sensitive
than
of
the
cogitative
part
of
our
natures
i
have
here
proved
that
the
very
same
principles
which
make
us
form
a
decision
upon
any
subject
and
correct
that
decision
by
the
consideration
of
our
genius
and
capacity
and
of
the
situation
of
our
mind
when
we
examined
that
subject
i
say
i
have
proved
that
these
same
principles
when
carryed
farther
and
applied
to
every
new
reflex
judgment
must
by
continually
diminishing
the
original
evidence
at
last
reduce
it
to
nothing
and
utterly
subvert
all
belief
and
opinion
if
belief
therefore
were
a
simple
act
of
the
thought
without
any
peculiar
manner
of
conception
or
the
addition
of
a
force
and
vivacity
it
must
infallibly
destroy
itself
and
in
every
case
terminate
in
a
total
suspense
of
judgment
but
as
experience
will
sufficiently
convince
any
one
who
thinks
it
worth
while
to
try
that
though
he
can
find
no
error
in
the
foregoing
arguments
yet
he
still
continues
to
believe
and
think
and
reason
as
usual
he
may
safely
conclude
that
his
reasoning
and
belief
is
some
sensation
or
peculiar
manner
of
conception
which
it
is
impossible
for
mere
ideas
and
reflections
to
destroy
but
here
perhaps
it
may
be
demanded
how
it
happens
even
upon
my
hypothesis
that
these
arguments
produce
not
a
total
suspense
of
judgment
and
after
what
manner
the
mind
ever
retains
a
degree
of
assurance
in
any
subject
for
as
these
new
probabilities
which
by
their
repetition
perpetually
diminish
the
original
evidence
are
founded
on
the
very
same
principles
whether
of
thought
or
sensation
as
the
primary
judgment
it
may
seem
unavoidable
that
in
either
case
they
must
equally
subvert
it
and
by
the
opposition
either
of
contrary
thoughts
or
sensations
reduce
the
mind
to
a
total
uncertainty
i
suppose
there
is
some
question
proposed
to
me
and
that
after
revolving
over
the
impressions
of
my
memory
and
senses
and
carrying
my
thoughts
from
them
to
such
objects
as
are
commonly
conjoined
with
them
i
feel
a
stronger
and
more
forcible
conception
on
the
one
side
than
on
the
other
this
strong
conception
forms
my
first
decision
i
suppose
that
afterwards
i
examine
my
judgment
itself
and
observing
from
experience
that
it
is
sometimes
just
and
sometimes
erroneous
i
consider
it
as
regulated
by
contrary
principles
or
causes
of
which
some
lead
to
truth
and
some
to
error
and
in
ballancing
these
contrary
causes
i
diminish
by
a
new
probability
the
assurance
of
my
first
decision
this
new
probability
is
liable
to
the
same
diminution
as
the
foregoing
and
so
on
in
infinitum
it
is
therefore
demanded
how
it
happens
that
even
after
all
we
retain
a
degree
of
belief
which
is
sufficient
for
our
purpose
either
in
philosophy
or
common
life
i
answer
that
after
the
first
and
second
decision
as
the
action
of
the
mind
becomes
forced
and
unnatural
and
the
ideas
faint
and
obscure
though
the
principles
of
judgment
and
the
ballancing
of
opposite
causes
be
the
same
as
at
the
very
beginning
yet
their
influence
on
the
imagination
and
the
vigour
they
add
to
or
diminish
from
the
thought
is
by
no
means
equal
where
the
mind
reaches
not
its
objects
with
easiness
and
facility
the
same
principles
have
not
the
same
effect
as
in
a
more
natural
conception
of
the
ideas
nor
does
the
imagination
feel
a
sensation
which
holds
any
proportion
with
that
which
arises
from
its
common
judgments
and
opinions
the
attention
is
on
the
stretch
the
posture
of
the
mind
is
uneasy
and
the
spirits
being
diverted
from
their
natural
course
are
not
governed
in
their
movements
by
the
same
laws
at
least
not
to
the
same
degree
as
when
they
flow
in
their
usual
channel
if
we
desire
similar
instances
it
will
not
be
very
difficult
to
find
them
the
present
subject
of
metaphysics
will
supply
us
abundantly
the
same
argument
which
would
have
been
esteemed
convincing
in
a
reasoning
concerning
history
or
politics
has
little
or
no
influence
in
these
abstruser
subjects
even
though
it
be
perfectly
comprehended
and
that
because
there
is
required
a
study
and
an
effort
of
thought
in
order
to
its
being
comprehended
and
this
effort
of
thought
disturbs
the
operation
of
our
sentiments
on
which
the
belief
depends
the
case
is
the
same
in
other
subjects
the
straining
of
the
imagination
always
hinders
the
regular
flowing
of
the
passions
and
sentiments
a
tragic
poet
that
would
represent
his
heroes
as
very
ingenious
and
witty
in
their
misfortunes
would
never
touch
the
passions
as
the
emotions
of
the
soul
prevent
any
subtile
reasoning
and
reflection
so
these
latter
actions
of
the
mind
are
equally
prejudicial
to
the
former
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
seems
to
be
endowed
with
a
certain
precise
degree
of
force
and
activity
which
it
never
employs
in
one
action
but
at
the
expense
of
all
the
rest
this
is
more
evidently
true
where
the
actions
are
of
quite
different
natures
since
in
that
case
the
force
of
the
mind
is
not
only
diverted
but
even
the
disposition
changed
so
as
to
render
us
incapable
of
a
sudden
transition
from
one
action
to
the
other
and
still
more
of
performing
both
at
once
no
wonder
then
the
conviction
which
arises
from
a
subtile
reasoning
diminishes
in
proportion
to
the
efforts
which
the
imagination
makes
to
enter
into
the
reasoning
and
to
conceive
it
in
all
its
parts
belief
being
a
lively
conception
can
never
be
entire
where
it
is
not
founded
on
something
natural
and
easy
this
i
take
to
be
the
true
state
of
the
question
and
can
not
approve
of
that
expeditious
way
which
some
take
with
the
sceptics
to
reject
at
once
all
their
arguments
without
enquiry
or
examination
if
the
sceptical
reasonings
be
strong
say
they
it
is
a
proof
that
reason
may
have
some
force
and
authority
if
weak
they
can
never
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
all
the
conclusions
of
our
understanding
this
argument
is
not
just
because
the
sceptical
reasonings
were
it
possible
for
them
to
exist
and
were
they
not
destroyed
by
their
subtility
would
be
successively
both
strong
and
weak
according
to
the
successive
dispositions
of
the
mind
reason
first
appears
in
possession
of
the
throne
prescribing
laws
and
imposing
maxims
with
an
absolute
sway
and
authority
her
enemy
therefore
is
obliged
to
take
shelter
under
her
protection
and
by
making
use
of
rational
arguments
to
prove
the
fallaciousness
and
imbecility
of
reason
produces
in
a
manner
a
patent
under
her
band
and
seal
this
patent
has
at
first
an
authority
proportioned
to
the
present
and
immediate
authority
of
reason
from
which
it
is
derived
but
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
contradictory
to
reason
it
gradually
diminishes
the
force
of
that
governing
power
and
its
own
at
the
same
time
till
at
last
they
both
vanish
away
into
nothing
by
a
regulax
and
just
diminution
the
sceptical
and
dogmatical
reasons
are
of
the
same
kind
though
contrary
in
their
operation
and
tendency
so
that
where
the
latter
is
strong
it
has
an
enemy
of
equal
force
in
the
former
to
encounter
and
as
their
forces
were
at
first
equal
they
still
continue
so
as
long
as
either
of
them
subsists
nor
does
one
of
them
lose
any
force
in
the
contest
without
taking
as
much
from
its
antagonist
it
is
happy
therefore
that
nature
breaks
the
force
of
all
sceptical
arguments
in
time
and
keeps
them
from
having
any
considerable
influence
on
the
understanding
were
we
to
trust
entirely
to
their
that
can
never
take
place
until
they
have
first
subverted
all

with

and

concerning

by
any
arguments
of

to
maintain
its
veracity
nature
has
not
left
this
to
his
choice
and
has
doubtless
esteemed
it
an
affair
of
too
great
importance
to
be
trusted
to
our
uncertain
reasonings
and
speculations
we
may
well
ask
what
causes
induce
us
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
body
but
it
is
in
vain
to
ask
whether
there
be
body
or
not
that
is
a
point
which
we
must
take
for
granted
in
all
our
reasonings
the
subject
then
of
our
present
enquiry
is
concerning
the
causes
which
induce
us
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
body
and
my
reasonings
on
this
head
i
shall
begin
with
a
distinction
which
at
first
sight
may
seem
superfluous
but
which
will
contribute
very
much
to
the
perfect
understanding
of
what
follows
we
ought
to
examine
apart
those
two
questions
which
are
commonly
confounded
together
viz
why
we
attribute
a
continued
existence
to
objects
even
when
they
are
not
present
to
the
senses
and
why
we
suppose
them
to
have
an
existence
distinct
from
the
mind
and
perception
under
this
last
head
i
comprehend
their
situation
as
well
as
relations
their
external
position
as
well
as
the
independence
of
their
existence
and
operation
these
two
questions
concerning
the
continued
and
distinct
existence
of
body
are
intimately
connected
together
for
if
the
objects
of
our
senses
continue
to
exist
even
when
they
are
not
perceived
their
existence
is
of
course
independent
of
and
distinct
from
the
perception
and
vice
versa
if
their
existence
be
independent
of
the
perception
and
distinct
from
it
they
must
continue
to
exist
even
though
they
be
not
perceived
but
though
the
decision
of
the
one
question
decides
the
other
yet
that
we
may
the
more
easily
discover
the
principles
of
human
nature
from
whence
the
decision
arises
we
shall
carry
along
with
us
this
distinction
and
shall
consider
whether
it
be
the
senses
reason
or
the
imagination
that
produces
the
opinion
of
a
continued
or
of
a
distinct
existence
these
are
the
only
questions
that
are
intelligible
on
the
present
subject
for
as
to
the
notion
of
external
existence
when
taken
for
something
specially
different
from
our
perceptions
part
ii
sect
we
have
already
shewn
its
absurdity
to
begin
with
the
senses
it
is
evident
these
faculties
are
incapable
of
giving
rise
to
the
notion
of
the
continued
existence
of
their
objects
after
they
no
longer
appear
to
the
senses
for
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
suppose
that
the
senses
continue
to
operate
even
after
they
have
ceased
all
manner
of
operation
these
faculties
therefore
if
they
have
any
influence
in
the
present
case
must
produce
the
opinion
of
a
distinct
not
of
a
continued
existence
and
in
order
to
that
must
present
their
impressions
either
as
images
and
representations
or
as
these
very
distinct
and
external
existences
that
our
senses
offer
not
their
impressions
as
the
images
of
something
distinct
or
independent
and
external
is
evident
because
they
convey
to
us
nothing
but
a
single
perception
and
never
give
us
the
least
intimation
of
any
thing
beyond
a
single
perception
can
never
produce
the
idea
of
a
double
existence
but
by
some
inference
either
of
the
reason
or
imagination
when
the
mind
looks
farther
than
what
immediately
appears
to
it
its
conclusions
can
never
be
put
to
the
account
of
the
senses
and
it
certainly
looks
farther
when
from
a
single
perception
it
infers
a
double
existence
and
supposes
the
relations
of
resemblance
and
causation
betwixt
them
if
our
senses
therefore
suggest
any
idea
of
distinct
existences
they
must
convey
the
impressions
as
those
very
existences
by
a
kind
of
fallacy
and
illusion
upon
this
bead
we
may
observe
that
all
sensations
are
felt
by
the
mind
such
as
they
really
are
and
that
when
we
doubt
whether
they
present
themselves
as
distinct
objects
or
as
mere
impressions
the
difficulty
is
not
concerning
their
nature
but
concerning
their
relations
and
situation
now
if
the
senses
presented
our
impressions
as
external
to
and
independent
of
ourselves
both
the
objects
and
ourselves
must
be
obvious
to
our
senses
otherwise
they
coued
not
be
compared
by
these
faculties
the
difficulty
then
is
how
fax
we
are
ourselves
the
objects
of
our
senses
it
is
certain
there
is
no
question
in
philosophy
more
abstruse
than
that
concerning
identity
and
the
nature
of
the
uniting
principle
which
constitutes
a
person
so
far
from
being
able
by
our
senses
merely
to
determine
this
question
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
most
profound
metaphysics
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
it
and
in
common
life
it
is
evident
these
ideas
of
self
and
person
are
never
very
fixed
nor
determinate
it
is
absurd
therefore
to
imagine
the
senses
can
ever
distinguish
betwixt
ourselves
and
external
objects
add
to
this
that
every
impression
external
and
internal
passions
affections
sensations
pains
and
pleasures
are
originally
on
the
same
footing
and
that
whatever
other
differences
we
may
observe
among
them
they
appear
all
of
them
in
their
true
colours
as
impressions
or
perceptions
and
indeed
if
we
consider
the
matter
aright
it
is
scarce
possible
it
should
be
otherwise
nor
is
it
conceivable
that
our
senses
should
be
more
capable
of
deceiving
us
in
the
situation
and
relations
than
in
the
nature
of
our
impressions
for
since
all
actions
and
sensations
of
the
mind
are
known
to
us
by
consciousness
they
must
necessarily
appear
in
every
particular
what
they
are
and
be
what
they
appear
every
thing
that
enters
the
mind
being
in
reality
a
perception
it
is
impossible
any
thing
should
to
feeling
appear
different
this
were
to
suppose
that
even
where
we
are
most
intimately
conscious
we
might
be
mistaken
but
not
to
lose
time
in
examining
whether
it
is
possible
for
our
senses
to
deceive
us
and
represent
our
perceptions
as
distinct
from
ourselves
that
is
as
external
to
and
independent
of
us
let
us
consider
whether
they
really
do
so
and
whether
this
error
proceeds
from
an
immediate
sensation
or
from
some
other
causes
to
begin
with
the
question
concerning
external
existence
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
setting
aside
the
metaphysical
question
of
the
identity
of
a
thinking
substance
our
own
body
evidently
belongs
to
us
and
as
several
impressions
appear
exterior
to
the
body
we
suppose
them
also
exterior
to
ourselves
the
paper
on
which
i
write
at
present
is
beyond
my
hand
the
table
is
beyond
the
paper
the
walls
of
the
chamber
beyond
the
table
and
in
casting
my
eye
towards
the
window
i
perceive
a
great
extent
of
fields
and
buildings
beyond
my
chamber
from
all
this
it
may
be
infered
that
no
other
faculty
is
required
beside
the
senses
to
convince
us
of
the
external
existence
of
body
but
to
prevent
this
inference
we
need
only
weigh
the
three
following
considerations
first
that
properly
speaking
it
is
not
our
body
we
perceive
when
we
regard
our
limbs
and
members
but
certain
impressions
which
enter
by
the
senses
so
that
the
ascribing
a
real
and
corporeal
existence
to
these
impressions
or
to
their
objects
is
an
act
of
the
mind
as
difficult
to
explain
as
that
which
we
examine
at
present
secondly
sounds
and
tastes
and
smelts
though
commonly
regarded
by
the
mind
as
continued
independent
qualities
appear
not
to
have
any
existence
in
extension
and
consequently
can
not
appear
to
the
senses
as
situated
externally
to
the
body
the
reason
why
we
ascribe
a
place
to
them
shall
be
considered
afterwards
thirdly
even
our
sight
informs
us
not
of
distance
or
outness
so
to
speak
immediately
and
without
a
certain
reasoning
and
experience
as
is
acknowledged
by
the
most
rational
philosophers
as
to
the
independency
of
our
perceptions
on
ourselves
this
can
never
be
an
object
of
the
senses
but
any
opinion
we
form
concerning
it
must
be
derived
from
experience
and
observation
and
we
shall
see
afterwards
that
our
conclusions
from
experience
are
far
from
being
favourable
to
the
doctrine
of
the
independency
of
our
perceptions
mean
while
we
may
observe
that
when
we
talk
of
real
distinct
existences
we
have
commonly
more
in
our
eye
their
independency
than
external
situation
in
place
and
think
an
object
has
a
sufficient
reality
when
its
being
is
uninterrupted
and
independent
of
the
incessant
revolutions
which
we
are
conscious
of
in
ourselves
thus
to
resume
what
i
have
said
concerning
the
senses
they
give
us
no
notion
of
continued
existence
because
they
can
not
operate
beyond
the
extent
in
which
they
really
operate
they
as
little
produce
the
opinion
of
a
distinct
existence
because
they
neither
can
offer
it
to
the
mind
as
represented
nor
as
original
to
offer
it
as
represented
they
must
present
both
an
object
and
an
image
to
make
it
appear
as
original
they
must
convey
a
falshood
and
this
falshood
must
lie
in
the
relations
and
situation
in
order
to
which
they
must
be
able
to
compare
the
object
with
ourselves
and
even
in
that
case
they
do
not
nor
is
it
possible
they
should
deceive
us
we
may
therefore
conclude
with
certainty
that
the
opinion
of
a
continued
and
of
a
distinct
existence
never
arises
from
the
senses
to
confirm
this
we
may
observe
that
there
are
three
different
kinds
of
impressions
conveyed
by
the
senses
the
first
are
those
of
the
figure
bulk
motion
and
solidity
of
bodies
the
second
those
of
colours
tastes
smells
sounds
heat
and
cold
the
third
are
the
pains
and
pleasures
that
arise
from
the
application
of
objects
to
our
bodies
as
by
the
cutting
of
our
flesh
with
steel
and
such
like
both
philosophers
and
the
vulgar
suppose
the
first
of
these
to
have
a
distinct
continued
existence
the
vulgar
only
regard
the
second
as
on
the
same
footing
both
philosophers
and
the
vulgar
again
esteem
the
third
to
be
merely
perceptions
and
consequently
interrupted
and
dependent
beings
now
it
is
evident
that
whatever
may
be
our
philosophical
opinion
colours
sounds
heat
and
cold
as
far
as
appears
to
the
senses
exist
after
the
same
manner
with
motion
and
solidity
and
that
the
difference
we
make
betwixt
them
in
this
respect
arises
not
from
the
mere
perception
so
strong
the
prejudice
for
the
distinct
continued
existence
of
the
former
qualities
that
when
the
contrary
opinion
is
advanced
by
modern
philosophers
people
imagine
they
can
almost
refute
it
from
their
feeling
and
experience
and
that
their
very
senses
contradict
this
philosophy
it
is
also
evident
that
colours
sounds
are
originally
on
the
same
footing
with
the
pain
that
arises
from
steel
and
pleasure
that
proceeds
from
a
fire
and
that
the
difference
betwixt
them
is
founded
neither
on
perception
nor
reason
but
on
the
imagination
for
as
they
are
confest
to
be
both
of
them
nothing
but
perceptions
arising
from
the
particular
configurations
and
motions
of
the
parts
of
body
wherein
possibly
can
their
difference
consist
upon
the
whole
then
we
may
conclude
that
as
far
as
the
senses
are
judges
all
perceptions
are
the
same
in
the
manner
of
their
existence
we
may
also
observe
in
this
instance
of
sounds
and
colours
that
we
can
attribute
a
distinct
continued
existence
to
objects
without
ever
consulting
reason
or
weighing
our
opinions
by
any
philosophical
principles
and
indeed
whatever
convincing
arguments
philosophers
may
fancy
they
can
produce
to
establish
the
belief
of
objects
independent
of
the
mind
it
is
obvious
these
arguments
are
known
but
to
very
few
and
that
it
is
not
by
them
that
children
peasants
and
the
greatest
part
of
mankind
are
induced
to
attribute
objects
to
some
impressions
and
deny
them
to
others
accordingly
we
find
that
all
the
conclusions
which
the
vulgar
form
on
this
head
are
directly
contrary
to
those
which
are
confirmed
by
philosophy
for
philosophy
informs
us
that
every
thing
which
appears
to
the
mind
is
nothing
but
a
perception
and
is
interrupted
and
dependent
on
the
mind
whereas
the
vulgar
confound
perceptions
and
objects
and
attribute
a
distinct
continued
existence
to
the
very
things
they
feel
or
see
this
sentiment
then
as
it
is
entirely
unreasonable
must
proceed
from
some
other
faculty
than
the
understanding
to
which
we
may
add
that
as
long
as
we
take
our
perceptions
and
objects
to
be
the
same
we
can
never
infer
the
existence
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
nor
form
any
argument
from
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
which
is
the
only
one
that
earl
assure
us
of
matter
of
fact
even
after
we
distinguish
our
perceptions
from
our
objects
it
will
appear
presently
that
we
are
still
incapable
of
reasoning
from
the
existence
of
one
to
that
of
the
other
so
that
upon
the
whole
our
reason
neither
does
nor
is
it
possible
it
ever
should
upon
any
supposition
give
us
an
assurance
of
the
continued
and
distinct
existence
of
body
that
opinion
must
be
entirely
owing
to
the
imagination
which
must
now
be
the
subject
of
our
enquiry
since
all
impressions
are
internal
and
perishing
existences
and
appear
as
such
the
notion
of
their
distinct
and
continued
existence
must
arise
from
a
concurrence
of
some
of
their
qualities
with
the
qualities
of
the
imagination
and
since
this
notion
does
not
extend
to
all
of
them
it
must
arise
from
certain
qualities
peculiar
to
some
impressions
it
will
therefore
be
easy
for
us
to
discover
these
qualities
by
a
comparison
of
the
impressions
to
which
we
attribute
a
distinct
and
continued
existence
with
those
which
we
regard
as
internal
and
perishing
we
may
observe
then
that
it
is
neither
upon
account
of
the
involuntariness
of
certain
impressions
as
is
commonly
supposed
nor
of
their
superior
force
and
violence
that
we
attribute
to
them
a
reality
and
continued
existence
which
we
refuse
to
others
that
are
voluntary
or
feeble
for
it
is
evident
our
pains
and
pleasures
our
passions
and
affections
which
we
never
suppose
to
have
any
existence
beyond
our
perception
operate
with
greater
violence
and
are
equally
involuntary
as
the
impressions
of
figure
and
extension
colour
and
sound
which
we
suppose
to
be
permanent
beings
the
heat
of
a
fire
when
moderate
is
supposed
to
exist
in
the
fire
but
the
pain
which
it
causes
upon
a
near
approach
is
not
taken
to
have
any
being
except
in
the
perception
these
vulgar
opinions
then
being
rejected
we
must
search
for
some
other
hypothesis
by
which
we
may
discover
those
peculiar
qualities
in
our
impressions
which
makes
us
attribute
to
them
a
distinct
and
continued
existence
after
a
little
examination
we
shall
find
that
all
those
objects
to
which
we
attribute
a
continued
existence
have
a
peculiar
constancy
which
distinguishes
them
from
the
impressions
whose
existence
depends
upon
our
perception
those
mountains
and
houses
and
trees
which
lie
at
present
under
my
eye
have
always
appeared
to
me
in
the
same
order
and
when
i
lose
sight
of
them
by
shutting
my
eyes
or
turning
my
head
i
soon
after
find
them
return
upon
me
without
the
least
alteration
my
bed
and
table
my
books
and
papers
present
themselves
in
the
same
uniform
manner
and
change
not
upon
account
of
any
interruption
in
my
seeing
or
perceivilng
them
this
is
the
case
with
all
the
impressions
whose
objects
are
supposed
to
have
an
external
existence
and
is
the
case
with
no
other
impressions
whether
gentle
or
violent
voluntary
or
involuntary
this
constancy
however
is
not
so
perfect
as
not
to
admit
of
very
considerable
exceptions
bodies
often
change
their
position
and
qualities
and
after
a
little
absence
or
interruption
may
become
hardly
knowable
but
here
it
is
observable
that
even
in
these
changes
they
preserve
a
coherence
and
have
a
regular
dependence
on
each
other
which
is
the
foundation
of
a
kind
of
reasoning
from
causation
and
produces
the
opinion
of
their
continued
existence
when
i
return
to
my
chamber
after
an
hour
absence
i
find
not
my
fire
in
the
same
situation
in
which
i
left
it
but
then
i
am
accustomed
in
other
instances
to
see
a
like
alteration
produced
in
a
like
time
whether
i
am
present
or
absent
near
or
remote
this
coherence
therefore
in
their
changes
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
external
objects
as
well
as
their
constancy
having
found
that
the
opinion
of
the
continued
existence
of
body
depends
on
the
coherence
and
constancy
of
certain
impressions
i
now
proceed
to
examine
after
what
manner
these
qualities
give
rise
to
so
extraordinary
an
opinion
to
begin
with
the
coherence
we
may
observe
that
though
those
internal
impressions
which
we
regard
as
fleeting
and
perishing
have
also
a
certain
coherence
or
regularity
in
their
appearances
yet
it
is
of
somewhat
a
different
nature
from
that
which
we
discover
in
bodies
our
passions
are
found
by
experience
to
have
a
mutual
connexion
with
and
dependence
on
each
other
but
on
no
occasion
is
it
necessary
to
suppose
that
they
have
existed
and
operated
when
they
were
not
perceived
in
order
to
preserve
the
same
dependence
and
connexion
of
which
we
have
had
experience
the
case
is
not
the
same
with
relation
to
external
objects
those
require
a
continued
existence
or
otherwise
lose
in
a
great
measure
the
regularity
of
their
operation
i
am
here
seated
in
my
chamber
with
my
face
to
the
fire
and
all
the
objects
that
strike
my
senses
are
contained
in
a
few
yards
around
me
my
memory
indeed
informs
me
of
the
existence
of
many
objects
but
then
this
information
extends
not
beyond
their
past
existence
nor
do
either
my
senses
or
memory
give
any
testimony
to
the
continuance
of
their
being
when
therefore
i
am
thus
seated
and
revolve
over
these
thoughts
i
hear
on
a
sudden
a
noise
as
of
a
door
turning
upon
its
hinges
and
a
little
after
see
a
porter
who
advances
towards
me
this
gives
occasion
to
many
new
reflections
and
reasonings
first
i
never
have
observed
that
this
noise
coued
proceed
from
any
thing
but
the
motion
of
a
door
and
therefore
conclude
that
the
present
phaenomenon
is
a
contradiction
to
all
past
experience
unless
the
door
which
i
remember
on
the
other
side
the
chamber
be
still
in
being
again
i
have
always
found
that
a
human
body
was
possest
of
a
quality
which
i
call
gravity
and
which
hinders
it
from
mounting
in
the
air
as
this
porter
must
have
done
to
arrive
at
my
chamber
unless
the
stairs
i
remember
be
not
annihilated
by
my
absence
but
this
is
not
all
i
receive
a
letter
which
upon
opening
it
i
perceive
by
the
and
subscription
to
have
come
from
a
friend
who
says
he
is
two
hundred
leagues
distant
it
is
evident
i
can
never
account
for
this
phenomenon
conformable
to
my
experience
in
other
instances
without
spreading
out
in
my
mind
the
whole
sea
and
continent
between
us
and
supposing
the
effects
and
continued
existence
of
posts
and
ferries
according
to
my
memory
and
observation
to
consider
these
phaenomena
of
the
porter
and
letter
in
a
certain
light
they
are
contradictions
to
common
experience
and
may
be
regarded
as
objections
to
those
maxims
which
we
form
concerning
the
connexions
of
causes
and
effects
i
am
accustomed
to
hear
such
a
sound
and
see
such
an
object
in
motion
at
the
same
time
i
have
not
received
in
this
particular
instance
both
these
perceptions
these
observations
are
contrary
unless
i
suppose
that
the
door
still
remains
and
that
it
was
opened
without
my
perceiving
it
and
this
supposition
which
was
at
first
entirely
arbitrary
and
hypothetical
acquires
a
force
and
evidence
by
its
being
the
only
one
upon
which
i
can
reconcile
these
contradictions
there
is
scarce
a
moment
of
my
life
wherein
there
is
not
a
similar
instance
presented
to
me
and
i
have
not
occasion
to
suppose
the
continued
existence
of
objects
in
order
to
connect
their
past
and
present
appearances
and
give
them
such
an
union
with
each
other
as
i
have
found
by
experience
to
be
suitable
to
their
particular
natures
and
circumstances
here
then
i
am
naturally
led
to
regard
the
world
as
something
real
and
durable
and
as
preserving
its
existence
even
when
it
is
no
longer
present
to
my
perception
but
though
this
conclusion
from
the
coherence
of
appearances
may
seem
to
be
of
the
same
nature
with
our
reasonings
concerning
causes
and
effects
as
being
derived
from
custom
and
regulated
by
past
experience
we
shall
find
upon
examination
that
they
are
at
the
bottom
considerably
different
from
each
other
and
that
this
inference
arises
from
the
understanding
and
from
custom
in
an
indirect
and
oblique
manner
for
it
will
readily
be
allowed
that
since
nothing
is
ever
really
present
to
the
mind
besides
its
own
perceptions
it
is
not
only
impossible
that
any
habit
should
ever
be
acquired
otherwise
than
by
the
regular
succession
of
these
perceptions
but
also
that
any
habit
should
ever
exceed
that
degree
of
regularity
any
degree
therefore
of
regularity
in
our
perceptions
can
never
be
a
foundation
for
us
to
infer
a
greater
degree
of
regularity
in
some
objects
which
are
not
perceived
since
this
supposes
a
contradiction
viz
a
habit
acquired
by
what
was
never
present
to
the
mind
but
it
is
evident
that
whenever
we
infer
the
continued
existence
of
the
objects
of
sense
from
their
coherence
and
the
frequency
of
their
union
it
is
in
order
to
bestow
on
the
objects
a
greater
regularity
than
what
is
observed
in
our
mere
perceptions
we
remark
a
connexion
betwixt
two
kinds
of
objects
in
their
past
appearance
to
the
senses
but
are
not
able
to
observe
this
connexion
to
be
perfectly
constant
since
the
turning
about
of
our
head
or
the
shutting
of
our
eyes
is
able
to
break
it
what
then
do
we
suppose
in
this
case
but
that
these
objects
still
continue
their
usual
connexion
notwithstanding
their
apparent
interruption
and
that
the
irregular
appearances
are
joined
by
something
of
which
we
are
insensible
but
as
all
reasoning
concerning
matters
of
fact
arises
only
from
custom
and
custom
can
only
be
the
effect
of
repeated
perceptions
the
extending
of
custom
and
reasoning
beyond
the
perceptions
can
never
be
the
direct
and
natural
effect
of
the
constant
repetition
and
connexion
but
must
arise
from
the
of
some
other
principles
i
have
already
observed
part
ii
sect
in
examining
the
foundation
of
mathematics
that
the
imagination
when
set
into
any
train
of
thinking
is
apt
to
continue
even
when
its
object
fails
it
and
like
a
galley
put
in
motion
by
the
oars
carries
on
its
course
without
any
new
impulse
this
i
have
assigned
for
the
reason
why
after
considering
several
loose
standards
of
equality
and
correcting
them
by
each
other
we
proceed
to
imagine
so
correct
and
exact
a
standard
of
that
relation
as
is
not
liable
to
the
least
error
or
variation
the
same
principle
makes
us
easily
entertain
this
opinion
of
the
continued
existence
of
body
objects
have
a
certain
coherence
even
as
they
appear
to
our
senses
but
this
coherence
is
much
greater
and
more
uniform
if
we
suppose
the
to
have
a
continued
existence
and
as
the
mind
is
once
in
the
train
of
observing
an
uniformity
among
objects
it
naturally
continues
till
it
renders
the
uniformity
as
compleat
as
possible
the
simple
supposition
of
their
continued
existence
suffices
for
this
purpose
and
gives
us
a
notion
of
a
much
greater
regularity
among
objects
than
what
they
have
when
we
look
no
farther
than
our
senses
but
whatever
force
we
may
ascribe
to
this
principle
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
weak
to
support
alone
so
vast
an
edifice
as
is
that
of
the
continued
existence
of
all
external
bodies
and
that
we
must
join
the
constancy
of
their
appearance
to
the
coherence
in
order
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
that
opinion
as
the
explication
of
this
will
lead
me
into
a
considerable
compass
of
very
profound
reasoning
i
think
it
proper
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
to
give
a
short
sketch
or
abridgment
of
my
system
and
afterwards
draw
out
all
its
parts
in
their
full
compass
this
inference
from
the
constancy
of
our
perceptions
like
the
precedent
from
their
coherence
gives
rise
to
the
opinion
of
the
continued
existence
of
body
which
is
prior
to
that
of
its
distinct
existence
and
produces
that
latter
principle
when
we
have
been
accustomed
to
observe
a
constancy
in
certain
impressions
and
have
found
that
the
perception
of
the
sun
or
ocean
for
instance
returns
upon
us
after
an
absence
or
annihilation
with
like
parts
and
in
a
like
order
as
at
its
first
appearance
we
are
not
apt
to
regard
these
interrupted
perceptions
as
different
which
they
really
are
but
on
the
contrary
consider
them
as
individually
the
same
upon
account
of
their
resemblance
but
as
this
interruption
of
their
existence
is
contrary
to
their
perfect
identity
and
makes
us
regard
the
first
impression
as
annihilated
and
the
second
as
newly
created
we
find
ourselves
somewhat
at
a
loss
and
are
involved
in
a
kind
of
contradiction
in
order
to
free
ourselves
from
this
difficulty
we
disguise
as
much
as
possible
the
interruption
or
rather
remove
it
entirely
by
supposing
that
these
interrupted
perceptions
are
connected
by
a
real
existence
of
which
we
are
insensible
this
supposition
or
idea
of
continued
existence
acquires
a
force
and
vivacity
from
the
memory
of
these
broken
impressions
and
from
that
propensity
which
they
give
us
to
suppose
them
the
same
and
according
to
the
precedent
reasoning
the
very
essence
of
belief
consists
in
the
force
and
vivacity
of
the
conception
in
order
to
justify
this
system
there
are
four
things
requisite
first
to
explain
the
principium
individuationis
or
principle
of
identity
secondly
give
a
reason
why
the
resemblance
of
our
broken
and
interrupted
perceptions
induces
us
to
attribute
an
identity
to
them
thirdly
account
for
that
propensity
which
this
illusion
gives
to
unite
these
broken
appearances
by
a
continued
existence
fourthly
and
lastly
explain
that
force
and
vivacity
of
conception
which
arises
from
the
propensity
first
as
to
the
principle
of
individuation
we
may
observe
that
the
view
of
any
one
object
is
not
sufficient
to
convey
the
idea
of
identity
for
in
that
proposition
an
object
is
the
same
with
itself
if
the
idea
expressed
by
the
word
object
were
no
ways
distinguished
from
that
meant
by
itself
we
really
should
mean
nothing
nor
would
the
proposition
contain
a
predicate
and
a
subject
which
however
are
implyed
in
this
affirmation
one
single
object
conveys
the
idea
of
unity
not
that
of
identity
on
the
other
hand
a
multiplicity
of
objects
can
never
convey
this
idea
however
resembling
they
may
be
supposed
the
mind
always
pronounces
the
one
not
to
be
the
other
and
considers
them
as
forming
two
three
or
any
determinate
number
of
objects
whose
existences
are
entirely
distinct
and
independent
since
then
both
number
and
unity
are
incompatible
with
the
relation
of
identity
it
must
lie
in
something
that
is
neither
of
them
but
to
tell
the
truth
at
first
sight
this
seems
utterly
impossible
betwixt
unity
and
number
there
can
be
no
medium
no
more
than
betwixt
existence
and
nonexistence
after
one
object
is
supposed
to
exist
we
must
either
suppose
another
also
to
exist
in
which
case
we
have
the
idea
of
number
or
we
must
suppose
it
not
to
exist
in
which
case
the
first
object
remains
at
unity
to
remove
this
difficulty
let
us
have
recourse
to
the
idea
of
time
or
duration
i
have
already
observd
part
ii
sect
that
time
in
a
strict
sense
implies
succession
and
that
when
we
apply
its
idea
to
any
unchangeable
object
it
is
only
by
a
fiction
of
the
imagination
by
which
the
unchangeable
object
is
supposd
to
participate
of
the
changes
of
the
objects
and
in
particular
of
that
of
our
perceptions
this
fiction
of
the
imagination
almost
universally
takes
place
and
it
is
by
means
of
it
that
a
single
object
placd
before
us
and
surveyd
for
any
time
without
our
discovering
in
it
any
interruption
or
variation
is
able
to
give
us
a
notion
of
identity
for
when
we
consider
any
two
points
of
this
time
we
may
place
them
in
different
lights
we
may
either
survey
them
at
the
very
same
instant
in
which
case
they
give
us
the
idea
of
number
both
by
themselves
and
by
the
object
which
must
be
multiplyd
in
order
to
be
conceivd
at
once
as
existent
in
these
two
different
points
of
time
or
on
the
other
hand
we
may
trace
the
succession
of
time
by
a
like
succession
of
ideas
and
conceiving
first
one
moment
along
with
the
object
then
existent
imagine
afterwards
a
change
in
the
time
without
any
variation
or
interruption
in
the
object
in
which
case
it
gives
us
the
idea
of
unity
here
then
is
an
idea
which
is
a
medium
betwixt
unity
and
number
or
more
properly
speaking
is
either
of
them
according
to
the
view
in
which
we
take
it
and
this
idea
we
call
that
of
identity
we
can
not
in
any
propriety
of
speech
say
that
an
object
is
the
same
with
itself
unless
we
mean
that
the
object
existent
at
one
time
is
the
same
with
itself
existent
at
another
by
this
means
we
make
a
difference
betwixt
the
idea
meant
by
the
word
object
and
that
meant
by
itself
without
going
the
length
of
number
and
at
the
same
time
without
restraining
ourselves
to
a
strict
and
absolute
unity
thus
the
principle
of
individuation
is
nothing
but
the
invariableness
and
uninterruptedness
of
any
object
thro
a
supposd
variation
of
time
by
which
the
mind
can
trace
it
in
the
different
periods
of
its
existence
without
any
break
of
the
view
and
without
being
obligd
to
form
the
idea
of
multiplicity
or
number
i
now
proceed
to
explain
the
second
part
of
my
system
and
shew
why
the
constancy
of
our
perceptions
makes
us
ascribe
to
them
a
perfect
numerical
identity
tho
there
be
very
long
intervals
betwixt
their
appearance
and
they
have
only
one
of
the
essential
qualities
of
identity
viz
invariableness
that
i
may
avoid
all
ambiguity
and
confusion
on
this
head
i
shall
observe
that
i
here
account
for
the
opinions
and
belief
of
the
vulgar
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
body
and
therefore
must
entirely
conform
myself
to
their
manner
of
thinking
and
of
expressing
themselves
now
we
have
already
observd
that
however
philosophers
may
distinguish
betwixt
the
objects
and
perceptions
of
the
senses
which
they
suppose
and
resembling
yet
this
is
a
distinction
which
is
not
comprehended
by
the
generality
of
mankind
who
as
they
perceive
only
one
being
can
never
assent
to
the
opinion
of
a
double
existence
and
representation
those
very
sensations
which
enter
by
the
eye
or
ear
are
with
them
the
true
objects
nor
can
they
readily
conceive
that
this
pen
or
paper
which
is
immediately
perceivd
represents
another
which
is
different
from
but
resembling
it
in
order
therefore
to
accommodate
myself
to
their
notions
i
shall
at
first
suppose
that
there
is
only
a
single
existence
which
i
shall
call
indifferently
object
or
perception
according
as
it
shall
seem
best
to
suit
my
purpose
understanding
by
both
of
them
what
any
common
man
means
by
a
hat
or
shoe
or
stone
or
any
other
impression
conveyd
to
him
by
his
senses
i
shall
be
sure
to
give
warning
when
i
return
to
a
more
philosophical
way
of
speaking
and
thinking
to
enter
therefore
upon
the
question
concerning
the
source
of
the
error
and
deception
with
regard
to
identity
when
we
attribute
it
to
our
resembling
perceptions
notwithstanding
their
interruption
i
must
here
recal
an
observation
which
i
have
already
provd
and
explaind
part
ii
sect
nothing
is
more
apt
to
make
us
mistake
one
idea
for
another
than
any
relation
betwixt
them
which
associates
them
together
in
the
imagination
and
makes
it
pass
with
facility
from
one
to
the
other
of
all
relations
that
of
resemblance
is
in
this
respect
the
most
efficacious
and
that
because
it
not
only
causes
an
association
of
ideas
but
also
of
dispositions
and
makes
us
conceive
the
one
idea
by
an
act
or
operation
of
the
mind
similar
to
that
by
which
we
conceive
the
other
this
circumstance
i
have
observd
to
be
of
great
moment
and
we
may
establish
it
for
a
general
rule
that
whatever
ideas
place
the
mind
in
the
same
disposition
or
in
similar
ones
are
very
apt
to
be
confounded
the
mind
readily
passes
from
one
to
the
other
and
perceives
not
the
change
without
a
strict
attention
of
which
generally
speaking
it
is
wholly
incapable
in
order
to
apply
this
general
maxim
we
must
first
examine
the
disposition
of
the
mind
in
viewing
any
object
which
preserves
a
perfect
identity
and
then
find
some
other
object
that
is
confounded
with
it
by
causing
a
similar
disposition
when
we
fix
our
thought
on
any
object
and
suppose
it
to
continue
the
same
for
some
time
it
is
evident
we
suppose
the
change
to
lie
only
in
the
time
and
never
exert
ourselves
to
produce
any
new
image
or
idea
of
the
object
the
faculties
of
the
mind
repose
themselves
in
a
manner
and
take
no
more
exercise
than
what
is
necessary
to
continue
that
idea
of
which
we
were
formerly
possest
and
which
subsists
without
variation
or
interruption
the
passage
from
one
moment
to
another
is
scarce
felt
and
distinguishes
not
itself
by
a
different
perception
or
idea
which
may
require
a
different
direction
of
the
spirits
in
order
to
its
conception
now
what
other
objects
beside
identical
ones
are
capable
of
placing
the
mind
in
the
same
disposition
when
it
considers
them
and
of
causing
the
same
uninterrupted
passage
of
the
imagination
from
one
idea
to
another
this
question
is
of
the
last
importance
for
if
we
can
find
any
such
objects
we
may
certainly
conclude
from
the
foregoing
principle
that
they
are
very
naturally
confounded
with
identical
ones
and
are
taken
for
them
in
most
of
our
reasonings
but
though
this
question
be
very
important
it
is
not
very
difficult
nor
doubtful
for
i
immediately
reply
that
a
succession
of
related
objects
places
the
mind
in
this
disposition
and
is
considered
with
the
same
smooth
and
uninterrupted
progress
of
the
imagination
as
attends
the
view
of
the
same
invariable
object
the
very
nature
and
essence
of
relation
is
to
connect
our
ideas
with
each
other
and
upon
the
appearance
of
one
to
facilitate
the
transition
to
its
correlative
the
passage
betwixt
related
ideas
is
therefore
so
smooth
and
easy
that
it
produces
little
alteration
on
the
mind
and
seems
like
the
continuation
of
the
same
action
and
as
the
continuation
of
the
same
action
is
an
effect
of
the
continued
view
of
the
same
object
it
is
for
this
reason
we
attribute
sameness
to
every
succession
of
related
objects
the
thought
slides
along
the
succession
with
equal
facility
as
if
it
considered
only
one
object
and
therefore
confounds
the
succession
with
the
identity
we
shall
afterwards
see
many
instances
of
this
tendency
of
relation
to
make
us
ascribe
an
identity
to
different
objects
but
shall
here
confine
ourselves
to
the
present
subject
we
find
by
experience
that
there
is
such
a
constancy
in
almost
all
the
impressions
of
the
senses
that
their
interruption
produces
no
alteration
on
them
and
hinders
them
not
from
returning
the
same
in
appearance
and
in
situation
as
at
their
first
existence
i
survey
the
furniture
of
my
chamber
i
shut
my
eyes
and
afterwards
open
them
and
find
the
new
perceptions
to
resemble
perfectly
those
which
formerly
struck
my
senses
this
resemblance
is
observed
in
a
thousand
instances
and
naturally
connects
together
our
ideas
of
these
interrupted
perceptions
by
the
strongest
relation
and
conveys
the
mind
with
an
easy
transition
from
one
to
another
an
easy
transition
or
passage
of
the
imagination
along
the
ideas
of
these
different
and
interrupted
perceptions
is
almost
the
same
disposition
of
mind
with
that
in
which
we
consider
one
constant
and
uninterrupted
perception
it
is
therefore
very
natural
for
us
to
mistake
the
one
for
the
other
footnote
this
reasoning
it
must
be
confest
is
somewhat
abstruse
and
difficult
to
be
comprehended
but
it
is
remarkable
that
this
very
difficulty
may
be
converted
into
a
proof
of
the
reasoning
we
may
observe
that
there
are
two
relations
and
both
of
them
resemblances
which
contribute
to
our
mistaking
the
succession
of
our
interrupted
perceptions
for
an
identical
object
the
first
is
the
resemblance
of
the
perceptions
the
second
is
the
resemblance
which
the
act
of
the
mind
in
surveying
a
succession
of
resembling
objects
bears
to
that
in
surveying
an
identical
object
now
these
resemblances
we
are
apt
to
confound
with
each
other
and
it
is
natural
we
shoud
according
to
this
very
reasoning
but
let
us
keep
them
distinct
and
we
shall
find
no
difficulty
in
conceiving
the
precedent
argument
the
persons
who
entertain
this
opinion
concerning
the
identity
of
our
resembling
perceptions
are
in
general
an
the
unthinking
and
unphilosophical
part
of
mankind
that
is
all
of
us
at
one
time
or
other
and
consequently
such
as
suppose
their
perceptions
to
be
their
only
objects
and
never
think
of
a
double
existence
internal
and
external
representing
and
represented
the
very
image
which
is
present
to
the
senses
is
with
us
the
real
body
and
it
is
to
these
interrupted
images
we
ascribe
a
perfect
identity
but
as
the
interruption
of
the
appearance
seems
contrary
to
the
identity
and
naturally
leads
us
to
regard
these
resembling
perceptions
as
different
from
each
other
we
here
find
ourselves
at
a
loss
how
to
reconcile
such
opposite
opinions
the
smooth
passage
of
the
imagination
along
the
ideas
of
the
resembling
perceptions
makes
us
ascribe
to
them
a
perfect
identity
the
interrupted
manner
of
their
appearance
makes
us
consider
them
as
so
many
resembling
but
still
distinct
beings
which
appear
after
certain
intervals
the
perplexity
arising
from
this
contradiction
produces
a
propension
to
unite
these
broken
appearances
by
the
fiction
of
a
continued
existence
which
is
the
third
part
of
that
hypothesis
i
proposed
to
explain
nothing
is
more
certain
from
experience
than
that
any
contradiction
either
to
the
sentiments
or
passions
gives
a
sensible
uneasiness
whether
it
proceeds
from
without
or
from
within
from
the
opposition
of
external
objects
or
from
the
combat
of
internal
principles
on
the
contrary
whatever
strikes
in
with
the
natural
propensities
and
either
externally
forwards
their
satisfaction
or
internally
concurs
with
their
movements
is
sure
to
give
a
sensible
pleasure
now
there
being
here
an
opposition
betwixt
the
notion
of
the
identity
of
resembling
perceptions
and
the
interruption
of
their
appearance
the
mind
must
be
uneasy
in
that
situation
and
will
naturally
seek
relief
from
the
uneasiness
since
the
uneasiness
arises
from
the
opposition
of
two
contrary
principles
it
must
look
for
relief
by
sacrificing
the
one
to
the
other
but
as
the
smooth
passage
of
our
thought
along
our
resembling
perceptions
makes
us
ascribe
to
them
an
identity
we
can
never
without
reluctance
yield
up
that
opinion
we
must
therefore
turn
to
the
other
side
and
suppose
that
our
perceptions
are
no
longer
interrupted
but
preserve
a
continued
as
well
as
an
invariable
existence
and
are
by
that
means
entirely
the
same
but
here
the
interruptions
in
the
appearance
of
these
perceptions
are
so
long
and
frequent
that
it
is
impossible
to
overlook
them
and
as
the
appearance
of
a
perception
in
the
mind
and
its
existence
seem
at
first
sight
entirely
the
same
it
may
be
doubted
whether
we
can
ever
assent
to
so
palpable
a
contradiction
and
suppose
a
perception
to
exist
without
being
present
to
the
mind
in
order
to
clear
up
this
matter
and
learn
how
the
interruption
in
the
appearance
of
a
perception
implies
not
necessarily
an
interruption
in
its
existence
it
will
be
proper
to
touch
upon
some
principles
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
explain
more
fully
afterwards
sect
we
may
begin
with
observing
that
the
difficulty
in
the
present
case
is
not
concerning
the
matter
of
fact
or
whether
the
mind
forms
such
a
conclusion
concerning
the
continued
existence
of
its
perceptions
but
only
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
conclusion
is
formed
and
principles
from
which
it
is
derived
it
is
certain
that
almost
all
mankind
and
even
philosophers
themselves
for
the
greatest
part
of
their
lives
take
their
perceptions
to
be
their
only
objects
and
suppose
that
the
very
being
which
is
intimately
present
to
the
mind
is
the
real
body
or
material
existence
it
is
also
certain
that
this
very
perception
or
object
is
supposed
to
have
a
continued
uninterrupted
being
and
neither
to
be
annihilated
by
our
absence
nor
to
be
brought
into
existence
by
our
presence
when
we
are
absent
from
it
we
say
it
still
exists
but
that
we
do
not
feel
we
do
not
see
it
when
we
are
present
we
say
we
feel
or
see
it
here
then
may
arise
two
questions
first
how
we
can
satisfy
ourselves
in
supposing
a
perception
to
be
absent
from
the
mind
without
being
annihilated
secondly
after
what
manner
we
conceive
an
object
to
become
present
to
the
mind
without
some
new
creation
of
a
perception
or
image
and
what
we
mean
by
this
seeing
and
feeling
and
perceiving
as
to
the
first
question
we
may
observe
that
what
we
call
a
mind
is
nothing
but
a
heap
or
collection
of
different
perceptions
united
together
by
certain
relations
and
supposed
though
falsely
to
be
endowed
with
a
perfect
simplicity
and
identity
now
as
every
perception
is
distinguishable
from
another
and
may
be
considered
as
separately
existent
it
evidently
follows
that
there
is
no
absurdity
in
separating
any
particular
perception
from
the
mind
that
is
in
breaking
off
all
its
relations
with
that
connected
mass
of
perceptions
which
constitute
a
thinking
being
the
same
reasoning
affords
us
an
answer
to
the
second
question
if
the
name
of
perception
renders
not
this
separation
from
a
mind
absurd
and
contradictory
the
name
of
object
standing
for
the
very
same
thing
can
never
render
their
conjunction
impossible
external
objects
are
seen
and
felt
and
become
present
to
the
mind
that
is
they
acquire
such
a
relation
to
a
connected
heap
of
perceptions
as
to
influence
them
very
considerably
in
augmenting
their
number
by
present
reflections
and
passions
and
in
storing
the
memory
with
ideas
the
same
continued
and
uninterrupted
being
may
therefore
be
sometimes
present
to
the
mind
and
sometimes
absent
from
it
without
any
real
or
essential
change
in
the
being
itself
an
interrupted
appearance
to
the
senses
implies
not
necessarily
an
interruption
in
the
existence
the
supposition
of
the
continued
existence
of
sensible
objects
or
perceptions
involves
no
contradiction
we
may
easily
indulge
our
inclination
to
that
supposition
when
the
exact
resemblance
of
our
perceptions
makes
us
ascribe
to
them
an
identity
we
may
remove
the
seeming
interruption
by
feigning
a
continued
being
which
may
fill
those
intervals
and
preserve
a
perfect
and
entire
identity
to
our
perceptions
but
as
we
here
not
only
feign
but
believe
this
continued
existence
the
question
is
from
whence
arises
such
a
belief
and
this
question
leads
us
to
the
fourth
member
of
this
system
it
has
been
proved
already
that
belief
in
general
consists
in
nothing
but
the
vivacity
of
an
idea
and
that
an
idea
may
acquire
this
vivacity
by
its
relation
to
some
present
impression
impressions
are
naturally
the
most
vivid
perceptions
of
the
mind
and
this
quality
is
in
part
conveyed
by
the
relation
to
every
connected
idea
the
relation
causes
a
smooth
passage
from
the
impression
to
the
idea
and
even
gives
a
propensity
to
that
passage
the
mind
falls
so
easily
from
the
one
perception
to
the
other
that
it
scarce
perceives
the
change
but
retains
in
the
second
a
considerable
share
of
the
vivacity
of
the
first
it
is
excited
by
the
lively
impression
and
this
vivacity
is
conveyed
to
the
related
idea
without
any
great
diminution
in
the
passage
by
reason
of
the
smooth
transition
and
the
propensity
of
the
imagination
but
suppose
that
this
propensity
arises
from
some
other
principle
besides
that
of
relation
it
is
evident
it
must
still
have
the
same
effect
and
convey
the
vivacity
from
the
impression
to
the
idea
now
this
is
exactly
the
present
case
our
memory
presents
us
with
a
vast
number
of
instances
of
perceptions
perfectly
resembling
each
other
that
return
at
different
distances
of
time
and
after
considerable
interruptions
this
resemblance
gives
us
a
propension
to
consider
these
interrupted
perceptions
as
the
same
and
also
a
propension
to
connect
them
by
a
continued
existence
in
order
to
justify
this
identity
and
avoid
the
contradiction
in
which
the
interrupted
appearance
of
these
perceptions
seems
necessarily
to
involve
us
here
then
we
have
a
propensity
to
feign
the
continued
existence
of
all
sensible
objects
and
as
this
propensity
arises
from
some
lively
impressions
of
the
memory
it
bestows
a
vivacity
on
that
fiction
or
in
other
words
makes
us
believe
the
continued
existence
of
body
if
sometimes
we
ascribe
a
continued
existence
to
objects
which
are
perfectly
new
to
us
and
of
whose
constancy
and
coherence
we
have
no
experience
it
is
because
the
manner
in
which
they
present
themselves
to
our
senses
resembles
that
of
constant
and
coherent
objects
and
this
resemblance
is
a
source
of
reasoning
and
analogy
and
leads
us
to
attribute
the
same
qualities
to
similar
objects
i
believe
an
intelligent
reader
will
find
less
difficulty
to
assent
to
this
system
than
to
comprehend
it
fully
and
distinctly
and
will
allow
after
a
little
reflection
that
every
part
carries
its
own
proof
along
with
it
it
is
indeed
evident
that
as
the
vulgar
suppose
their
perceptions
to
be
their
only
objects
and
at
the
same
time
believe
the
continued
existence
of
matter
we
must
account
for
the
origin
of
the
belief
upon
that
supposition
now
upon
that
supposition
it
is
a
false
opinion
that
any
of
our
objects
or
perceptions
are
identically
the
same
after
an
interruption
and
consequently
the
opinion
of
their
identity
can
never
arise
from
reason
but
must
arise
from
the
imagination
the
imagination
is
seduced
into
such
an
opinion
only
by
means
of
the
resemblance
of
certain
perceptions
since
we
find
they
are
only
our
resembling
perceptions
which
we
have
a
propension
to
suppose
the
same
this
propension
to
bestow
an
identity
on
our
resembling
perceptions
produces
the
fiction
of
a
continued
existence
since
that
fiction
as
well
as
the
identity
is
really
false
as
is
acknowledged
by
all
philosophers
and
has
no
other
effect
than
to
remedy
the
interruption
of
our
perceptions
which
is
the
only
circumstance
that
is
contrary
to
their
identity
in
the
last
place
this
propension
causes
belief
by
means
of
the
present
impressions
of
the
memory
since
without
the
remembrance
of
former
sensations
it
is
plain
we
never
should
have
any
belief
of
the
continued
existence
of
body
thus
in
examining
all
these
parts
we
find
that
each
of
them
is
supported
by
the
strongest
proofs
and
that
all
of
them
together
form
a
consistent
system
which
is
perfectly
convincing
a
strong
propensity
or
inclination
alone
without
any
present
impression
will
sometimes
cause
a
belief
or
opinion
how
much
more
when
aided
by
that
circumstance
but
though
we
are
led
after
this
manner
by
the
natural
propensity
of
the
imagination
to
ascribe
a
continued
existence
to
those
sensible
objects
or
perceptions
which
we
find
to
resemble
each
other
in
their
interrupted
appearance
yet
a
very
little
reflection
and
philosophy
is
sufficient
to
make
us
perceive
the
fallacy
of
that
opinion
i
have
already
observed
that
there
is
an
intimate
connexion
betwixt
those
two
principles
of
a
continued
and
of
a
distinct
or
independent
existence
and
that
we
no
sooner
establish
the
one
than
the
other
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
it
is
the
opinion
of
a
continued
existence
which
first
takes
place
and
without
much
study
or
reflection
draws
the
other
along
with
it
wherever
the
mind
follows
its
first
and
most
natural
tendency
but
when
we
compare
experiments
and
reason
a
little
upon
them
we
quickly
perceive
that
the
doctrine
of
the
independent
existence
of
our
sensible
perceptions
is
contrary
to
the
plainest
experience
this
leads
us
backward
upon
our
footsteps
to
perceive
our
error
in
attributing
a
continued
existence
to
our
perceptions
and
is
the
origin
of
many
very
curious
opinions
which
we
shall
here
endeavour
to
account
for
it
will
first
be
proper
to
observe
a
few
of
those
experiments
which
convince
us
that
our
perceptions
are
not
possest
of
any
independent
existence
when
we
press
one
eye
with
a
finger
we
immediately
perceive
all
the
objects
to
become
double
and
one
half
of
them
to
be
removed
from
their
common
and
natural
position
but
as
we
do
not
attribute
to
continued
existence
to
both
these
perceptions
and
as
they
are
both
of
the
same
nature
we
clearly
perceive
that
all
our
perceptions
are
dependent
on
our
organs
and
the
disposition
of
our
nerves
and
animal
spirits
this
opinion
is
confirmed
by
the
seeming
encrease
and
diminution
of
objects
according
to
their
distance
by
the
apparent
alterations
in
their
figure
by
the
changes
in
their
colour
and
other
qualities
from
our
sickness
and
distempers
and
by
an
infinite
number
of
other
experiments
of
the
same
kind
from
all
which
we
learn
that
our
sensible
perceptions
are
not
possest
of
any
distinct
or
independent
existence
the
natural
consequence
of
this
reasoning
should
be
that
our
perceptions
have
no
more
a
continued
than
an
independent
existence
and
indeed
philosophers
have
so
far
run
into
this
opinion
that
they
change
their
system
and
distinguish
as
we
shall
do
for
the
future
betwixt
perceptions
and
objects
of
which
the
former
are
supposed
to
be
interrupted
and
perishing
and
different
at
every
different
return
the
latter
to
be
uninterrupted
and
to
preserve
a
continued
existence
and
identity
but
however
philosophical
this
new
system
may
be
esteemed
i
assert
that
it
is
only
a
palliative
remedy
and
that
it
contains
all
the
difficulties
of
the
vulgar
system
with
some
others
that
are
peculiar
to
itself
there
are
no
principles
either
of
the
understanding
or
fancy
which
lead
us
directly
to
embrace
this
opinion
of
the
double
existence
of
perceptions
and
objects
nor
can
we
arrive
at
it
but
by
passing
through
the
common
hypothesis
of
the
identity
and
continuance
of
our
interrupted
perceptions
were
we
not
first
perswaded
that
our
perceptions
are
our
only
objects
and
continue
to
exist
even
when
they
no
longer
make
their
appearance
to
the
senses
we
should
never
be
led
to
think
that
our
perceptions
and
objects
are
different
and
that
our
objects
alone
preserve
a
continued
existence
the
latter
hypothesis
has
no
primary
recommendation
either
to
reason
or
the
imagination
but
acquires
all
its
influence
on
the
imagination
from
the
former
this
proposition
contains
two
parts
which
we
shall
endeavour
to
prove
as
distinctly
and
clearly
as
such
abstruse
subjects
will
permit
as
to
the
first
part
of
the
proposition
that
this
philosophical
hypothesis
has
no
primary
recommendation
either
to
reason
or
the
imagination
we
may
soon
satisfy
ourselves
with
regard
to
reason
by
the
following
reflections
the
only
existences
of
which
we
are
certain
are
perceptions
which
being
immediately
present
to
us
by
consciousness
command
our
strongest
assent
and
are
the
first
foundation
of
all
our
conclusions
the
only
conclusion
we
can
draw
from
the
existence
of
one
thing
to
that
of
another
is
by
means
of
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
which
shews
that
there
is
a
connexion
betwixt
them
and
that
the
existence
of
one
is
dependent
on
that
of
the
other
the
idea
of
this
relation
is
derived
from
past
experience
by
which
we
find
that
two
beings
are
constantly
conjoined
together
and
are
always
present
at
once
to
the
mind
but
as
no
beings
are
ever
present
to
the
mind
but
perceptions
it
follows
that
we
may
observe
a
conjunction
or
a
relation
of
cause
and
effect
between
different
perceptions
but
can
never
observe
it
between
perceptions
and
objects
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
from
the
existence
or
any
of
the
qualities
of
the
former
we
can
ever
form
any
conclusion
concerning
the
existence
of
the
latter
or
ever
satisfy
our
reason
in
this
particular
it
is
no
less
certain
that
this
philosophical
system
has
no
primary
recommendation
to
the
imagination
and
that
that
faculty
would
never
of
itself
and
by
its
original
tendency
have
fallen
upon
such
a
principle
i
confess
it
will
be
somewhat
difficult
to
prove
this
to
the
fall
satisfaction
of
the
reader
because
it
implies
a
negative
which
in
many
cases
will
not
admit
of
any
positive
proof
if
any
one
would
take
the
pains
to
examine
this
question
and
would
invent
a
system
to
account
for
the
direct
origin
of
this
opinion
from
the
imagination
we
should
be
able
by
the
examination
of
that
system
to
pronounce
a
certain
judgment
in
the
present
subject
let
it
be
taken
for
granted
that
our
perceptions
are
broken
and
interrupted
and
however
like
are
still
different
from
each
other
and
let
any
one
upon
this
supposition
shew
why
the
fancy
directly
and
immediately
proceeds
to
the
belief
of
another
existence
resembling
these
perceptions
in
their
nature
but
yet
continued
and
uninterrupted
and
identical
and
after
he
has
done
this
to
my
satisfaction
i
promise
to
renounce
my
present
opinion
mean
while
i
can
not
forbear
concluding
from
the
very
abstractedness
and
difficulty
of
the
first
supposition
that
it
is
an
improper
subject
for
the
fancy
to
work
upon
whoever
would
explain
the
origin
of
the
common
opinion
concerning
the
continued
and
distinct
existence
of
body
must
take
the
mind
in
its
common
situation
and
must
proceed
upon
the
supposition
that
our
perceptions
are
our
only
objects
and
continue
to
exist
even
when
they
are
not
perceived
though
this
opinion
be
false
it
is
the
most
natural
of
any
and
has
alone
any
primary
recommendation
to
the
fancy
as
to
the
second
part
of
the
proposition
that
the
philosophical
system
acquires
all
its
influence
on
the
imagination
from
the
vulgar
one
we
may
observe
that
this
is
a
natural
and
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
foregoing
conclusion
that
it
has
no
primary
recommendation
to
reason
or
the
imagination
for
as
the
philosophical
system
is
found
by
experience
to
take
hold
of
many
minds
and
in
particular
of
all
those
who
reflect
ever
so
little
on
this
subject
it
must
derive
all
its
authority
from
the
vulgar
system
since
it
has
no
original
authority
of
its
own
the
manner
in
which
these
two
systems
though
directly
contrary
are
connected
together
may
be
explains
as
follows
the
imagination
naturally
runs
on
in
this
train
of
thinking
our
perceptions
are
our
only
objects
resembling
perceptions
are
the
same
however
broken
or
uninterrupted
in
their
appearance
this
appealing
interruption
is
contrary
to
the
identity
the
interruption
consequently
extends
not
beyond
the
appearance
and
the
perception
or
object
really
continues
to
exist
even
when
absent
from
us
our
sensible
perception
s
have
therefore
a
continued
and
uninterrupted
existence
but
as
a
little
reflection
destroys
this
conclusion
that
our
perceptions
have
a
continued
existence
by
shewing
that
they
have
a
dependent
one
it
would
naturally
be
expected
that
we
must
altogether
reject
the
opinion
that
there
is
such
a
thing
in
nature
as
a
continued
existence
which
is
preserved
even
when
it
no
longer
appears
to
the
senses
the
case
however
is
otherwise
philosophers
are
so
far
from
rejecting
the
opinion
of
a
continued
existence
upon
rejecting
that
of
the
independence
and
continuance
of
our
sensible
perceptions
that
though
all
sects
agree
in
the
latter
sentiment
the
former
which
is
in
a
manner
its
necessary
consequence
has
been
peculiar
to
a
few
extravagant
sceptics
who
after
all
maintained
that
opinion
in
words
only
and
were
never
able
to
bring
themselves
sincerely
to
believe
it
there
is
a
great
difference
betwixt
such
opinions
as
we
form
after
a
calm
and
profound
reflection
and
such
as
we
embrace
by
a
kind
of
instinct
or
natural
impulse
on
account
of
their
suitableness
and
conformity
to
the
mind
if
these
opinions
become
contrary
it
is
not
difficult
to
foresee
which
of
them
will
have
the
advantage
as
long
as
our
attention
is
bent
upon
the
subject
the
philosophical
and
studyed
principle
may
prevail
but
the
moment
we
relax
our
thoughts
nature
will
display
herself
and
draw
us
back
to
our
former
opinion
nay
she
has
sometimes
such
an
influence
that
she
can
stop
our
progress
even
in
the
midst
of
our
most
profound
reflections
and
keep
us
from
running
on
with
all
the
consequences
of
any
philosophical
opinion
thus
though
we
clearly
perceive
the
dependence
and
interruption
of
our
perceptions
we
stop
short
in
our
career
and
never
upon
that
account
reject
the
notion
of
an
independent
and
continued
existence
that
opinion
has
taken
such
deep
root
in
the
imagination
that
it
is
impossible
ever
to
eradicate
it
nor
will
any
strained
metaphysical
conviction
of
the
dependence
of
our
perceptions
be
sufficient
for
that
purpose
but
though
our
natural
and
obvious
principles
here
prevail
above
our
studied
reflections
it
is
certain
there
must
be
sonic
struggle
and
opposition
in
the
case
at
least
so
long
as
these
rejections
retain
any
force
or
vivacity
in
order
to
set
ourselves
at
ease
in
this
particular
we
contrive
a
new
hypothesis
which
seems
to
comprehend
both
these
principles
of
reason
and
imagination
this
hypothesis
is
the
philosophical
one
of
the
double
existence
of
perceptions
and
objects
which
pleases
our
reason
in
allowing
that
our
dependent
perceptions
are
interrupted
and
different
and
at
the
same
time
is
agreeable
to
the
imagination
in
attributing
a
continued
existence
to
something
else
which
we
call
objects
this
philosophical
system
therefore
is
the
monstrous
offspring
of
two
principles
which
are
contrary
to
each
other
which
are
both
at
once
embraced
by
the
mind
and
which
are
unable
mutually
to
destroy
each
other
the
imagination
tells
us
that
our
resembling
perceptions
have
a
continued
and
uninterrupted
existence
and
are
not
annihilated
by
their
absence
reflection
tells
us
that
even
our
resembling
perceptions
are
interrupted
in
their
existence
and
different
from
each
other
the
contradiction
betwixt
these
opinions
we
elude
by
a
new
fiction
which
is
conformable
to
the
hypotheses
both
of
reflection
and
fancy
by
ascribing
these
contrary
qualities
to
different
existences
the
interruption
to
perceptions
and
the
continuance
to
objects
nature
is
obstinate
and
will
not
quit
the
field
however
strongly
attacked
by
reason
and
at
the
same
time
reason
is
so
clear
in
the
point
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
disguising
her
not
being
able
to
reconcile
these
two
enemies
we
endeavour
to
set
ourselves
at
ease
as
much
as
possible
by
successively
granting
to
each
whatever
it
demands
and
by
feigning
a
double
existence
where
each
may
find
something
that
has
all
the
conditions
it
desires
were
we
fully
convinced
that
our
resembling
perceptions
are
continued
and
identical
and
independent
we
should
never
run
into
this
opinion
of
a
double
existence
since
we
should
find
satisfaction
in
our
first
supposition
and
would
not
look
beyond
again
were
we
fully
convinced
that
our
perceptions
are
dependent
and
interrupted
and
different
we
should
be
as
little
inclined
to
embrace
the
opinion
of
a
double
existence
since
in
that
case
we
should
clearly
perceive
the
error
of
our
first
supposition
of
a
continued
existence
and
would
never
regard
it
any
farther
it
is
therefore
from
the
intermediate
situation
of
the
mind
that
this
opinion
arises
and
from
such
an
adherence
to
these
two
contrary
principles
as
makes
us
seek
some
pretext
to
justify
our
receiving
both
which
happily
at
last
is
found
in
the
system
of
a
double
existence
another
advantage
of
this
philosophical
system
is
its
similarity
to
the
vulgar
one
by
which
means
we
can
humour
our
reason
for
a
moment
when
it
becomes
troublesome
and
sollicitous
and
yet
upon
its
least
negligence
or
inattention
can
easily
return
to
our
vulgar
and
natural
notions
accordingly
we
find
that
philosophers
neglect
not
this
advantage
but
immediately
upon
leaving
their
closets
mingle
with
the
rest
of
mankind
in
those
exploded
opinions
that
our
perceptions
are
our
only
objects
and
continue
identically
and
uninterruptedly
the
same
in
all
their
interrupted
appearances
there
are
other
particulars
of
this
system
wherein
we
may
remark
its
dependence
on
the
fancy
in
a
very
conspicuous
manner
of
these
i
shall
observe
the
two
following
first
we
suppose
external
objects
to
resemble
internal
perceptions
i
have
already
shewn
that
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
can
never
afford
us
any
just
conclusion
from
the
existence
or
qualities
of
our
perceptions
to
the
existence
of
external
continued
objects
and
i
shall
farther
add
that
even
though
they
coued
afford
such
a
conclusion
we
should
never
have
any
reason
to
infer
that
our
objects
resemble
our
perceptions
that
opinion
therefore
is
derived
from
nothing
but
the
quality
of
the
fancy
that
it
borrows
all
its
ideas
from
some
precedent
perception
we
never
can
conceive
any
thing
but
perceptions
and
therefore
must
make
every
thing
resemble
them
secondly
as
we
suppose
our
objects
in
general
to
resemble
our
perceptions
so
we
take
it
for
granted
that
every
particular
object
resembles
that
perception
which
it
causes
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
determines
us
to
join
the
other
of
resemblance
and
the
ideas
of
these
existences
being
already
united
together
in
the
fancy
by
the
former
relation
we
naturally
add
the
latter
to
compleat
the
union
we
have
a
strong
propensity
to
compleat
every
union
by
joining
new
relations
to
those
which
we
have
before
observed
betwixt
any
ideas
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
presently
sect
having
thus
given
an
account
of
all
the
systems
both
popular
and
philosophical
with
regard
to
external
existences
i
can
not
forbear
giving
vent
to
a
certain
sentiment
which
arises
upon
reviewing
those
systems
i
begun
this
subject
with
premising
that
we
ought
to
have
an
implicit
faith
in
our
senses
and
that
this
would
be
the
conclusion
i
should
draw
from
the
whole
of
my
reasoning
but
to
be
ingenuous
i
feel
myself
at
present
of
a
quite
contrary
sentiment
and
am
more
inclined
to
repose
no
faith
at
all
in
my
senses
or
rather
imagination
than
to
place
in
it
such
an
implicit
confidence
i
can
not
conceive
how
such
trivial
qualities
of
the
fancy
conducted
by
such
false
suppositions
can
ever
lead
to
any
solid
and
rational
system
they
are
the
coherence
and
constancy
of
our
perceptions
which
produce
the
opinion
of
their
continued
existence
though
these
qualities
of
perceptions
have
no
perceivable
connexion
with
such
an
existence
the
constancy
of
our
perceptions
has
the
most
considerable
effect
and
yet
is
attended
with
the
greatest
difficulties
it
is
a
gross
illusion
to
suppose
that
our
resembling
perceptions
are
numerically
the
same
and
it
is
this
illusion
which
leads
us
into
the
opinion
that
these
perceptions
are
uninterrupted
and
are
still
existent
even
when
they
are
not
present
to
the
senses
this
is
the
case
with
our
popular
system
and
as
to
our
philosophical
one
it
is
liable
to
the
same
difficulties
and
is
loaded
with
this
absurdity
that
it
at
once
denies
and
establishes
the
vulgar
supposition
philosophers
deny
our
resembling
perceptions
to
be
identically
the
same
and
uninterrupted
and
yet
have
so
great
a
propensity
to
believe
them
such
that
they
arbitrarily
invent
a
new
set
of
perceptions
to
which
they
attribute
these
qualities
i
say
a
new
set
of
perceptions
for
we
may
well
suppose
in
general
but
it
is
impossible
for
us
distinctly
to
conceive
objects
to
be
in
their
nature
any
thing
but
exactly
the
same
with
perceptions
what
then
can
we
look
for
from
this
confusion
of
groundless
and
extraordinary
opinions
but
error
and
falshood
and
how
can
we
justify
to
ourselves
any
belief
we
repose
in
them
this
sceptical
doubt
both
with
respect
to
reason
and
the
senses
is
a
malady
which
can
never
be
radically
cured
but
must
return
upon
us
every
moment
however
we
may
chace
it
away
and
sometimes
may
seem
entirely
free
from
it
it
is
impossible
upon
any
system
to
defend
either
our
understanding
or
senses
and
we
but
expose
them
farther
when
we
endeavour
to
justify
them
in
that
manner
as
the
sceptical
doubt
arises
naturally
from
a
profound
and
intense
reflection
on
those
subjects
it
always
encreases
the
farther
we
carry
our
reflections
whether
in
opposition
or
conformity
to
it
carelessness
and
alone
can
afford
us
any
remedy
for
this
reason
i
rely
entirely
upon
them
and
take
it
for
granted
whatever
may
be
the
reader
opinion
at
this
present
moment
that
an
hour
hence
he
will
be
persuaded
there
is
both
an
external
and
internal
world
and
going
upon
that
supposition
i
intend
to
examine
some
general
systems
both
ancient
and
modern
which
have
been
proposed
of
both
before
i
proceed
to
a
more
particular
enquiry
concerning
our
impressions
this
will
not
perhaps
in
the
end
be
found
foreign
to
our
present
purpose
sect
iii
of
the
antient
philosophy
several
moralists
have
recommended
it
as
an
excellent
method
of
becoming
acquainted
with
our
own
hearts
and
knowing
our
progress
in
virtue
to
recollect
our
dreams
in
a
morning
and
examine
them
with
the
same
rigour
that
we
would
our
most
serious
and
most
deliberate
actions
our
character
is
the
same
throughout
say
they
and
appears
best
where
artifice
fear
and
policy
have
no
place
and
men
can
neither
be
hypocrites
with
themselves
nor
others
the
generosity
or
baseness
of
our
temper
our
meekness
or
cruelty
our
courage
or
pusilanimity
influence
the
fictions
of
the
imagination
with
the
most
unbounded
liberty
and
discover
themselves
in
the
most
glaring
colours
in
like
manner
i
am
persuaded
there
might
be
several
useful
discoveries
made
from
a
criticism
of
the
fictions
of
the
antient
philosophy
concerning
substances
and
substantial
form
and
accidents
and
occult
qualities
which
however
unreasonable
and
capricious
have
a
very
intimate
connexion
with
the
principles
of
human
nature
it
is
confest
by
the
most
judicious
philosophers
that
our
ideas
of
bodies
are
nothing
but
collections
formed
by
the
mind
of
the
ideas
of
the
several
distinct
sensible
qualities
of
which
objects
are
composed
and
which
we
find
to
have
a
constant
union
with
each
other
but
however
these
qualities
may
in
themselves
be
entirely
distinct
it
is
certain
we
commonly
regard
the
compound
which
they
form
as
one
thing
and
as
continuing
the
same
under
very
considerable
alterations
the
acknowledged
composition
is
evidently
contrary
to
this
supposed
simplicity
and
the
variation
to
the
identity
it
may
therefore
be
worth
while
to
consider
the
causes
which
make
us
almost
universally
fall
into
such
evident
contradictions
as
well
as
the
means
by
which
we
endeavour
to
conceal
them
it
is
evident
that
as
the
ideas
of
the
several
distinct
successive
qualities
of
objects
are
united
together
by
a
very
close
relation
the
mind
in
looking
along
the
succession
must
be
carryed
from
one
part
of
it
to
another
by
an
easy
transition
and
will
no
more
perceive
the
change
than
if
it
contemplated
the
same
unchangeable
object
this
easy
transition
is
the
effect
or
rather
essence
of
relation
i
and
as
the
imagination
readily
takes
one
idea
for
another
where
their
influence
on
the
mind
is
similar
hence
it
proceeds
that
any
such
succession
of
related
qualities
is
readily
considered
as
one
continued
object
existing
without
any
variation
the
smooth
and
uninterrupted
progress
of
the
thought
being
alike
in
both
cases
readily
deceives
the
mind
and
makes
us
ascribe
an
identity
to
the
changeable
succession
of
connected
qualities
but
when
we
alter
our
method
of
considering
the
succession
and
instead
of
traceing
it
gradually
through
the
successive
points
of
time
survey
at
once
any
two
distinct
periods
of
its
duration
and
compare
the
different
conditions
of
the
successive
qualities
in
that
case
the
variations
which
were
insensible
when
they
arose
gradually
do
now
appear
of
consequence
and
seem
entirely
to
destroy
the
identity
by
this
means
there
arises
a
kind
of
contrariety
in
our
method
of
thinking
from
the
different
points
of
view
in
which
we
survey
the
object
and
from
the
nearness
or
remoteness
of
those
instants
of
time
which
we
compare
together
when
we
gradually
follow
an
object
in
its
successive
changes
the
smooth
progress
of
the
thought
makes
us
ascribe
an
identity
to
the
succession
because
it
is
by
a
similar
act
of
the
mind
we
consider
an
unchangeable
object
when
we
compare
its
situation
after
a
considerable
change
the
progress
of
the
thought
is
broke
and
consequently
we
are
presented
with
the
idea
of
diversity
in
order
to
reconcile
which
contradictions
the
imagination
is
apt
to
feign
something
unknown
and
invisible
which
it
supposes
to
continue
the
same
under
all
these
variations
and
this
unintelligible
something
it
calls
a
substance
or
original
and
first
matter
we
entertain
a
like
notion
with
regard
to
the
simplicity
of
substances
and
from
like
causes
suppose
an
object
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
to
be
presented
along
with
another
object
whose
parts
are
connected
together
by
a
strong
relation
it
is
evident
the
actions
of
the
mind
in
considering
these
two
objects
are
not
very
different
the
imagination
conceives
the
simple
object
at
once
with
facility
by
a
single
effort
of
thought
without
change
or
variation
the
connexion
of
parts
in
the
compound
object
has
almost
the
same
effect
and
so
unites
the
object
within
itself
that
the
fancy
feels
not
the
transition
in
passing
from
one
part
to
another
hence
the
colour
taste
figure
solidity
and
other
qualities
combined
in
a
peach
or
melon
are
conceived
to
form
one
thing
and
that
on
account
of
their
close
relation
which
makes
them
affect
the
thought
in
the
same
manner
as
if
perfectly
uncompounded
but
the
mind
rests
not
here
whenever
it
views
the
object
in
another
light
it
finds
that
all
these
qualities
are
different
and
distinguishable
and
separable
from
each
other
which
view
of
things
being
destructive
of
its
primary
and
more
natural
notions
obliges
the
imagination
to
feign
an
unknown
something
or
original
substance
and
matter
as
a
principle
of
union
or
cohesion
among
these
qualities
and
as
what
may
give
the
compound
object
a
title
to
be
called
one
thing
notwithstanding
its
diversity
and
composition
the
peripatetic
philosophy
asserts
the
original
matter
to
be
perfectly
homogeneous
in
all
bodies
and
considers
fire
water
earth
and
air
as
of
the
very
same
substance
on
account
of
their
gradual
revolutions
and
changes
into
each
other
at
the
same
time
it
assigns
to
each
of
these
species
of
objects
a
distinct
substantial
form
which
it
supposes
to
be
the
source
of
all
those
different
qualities
they
possess
and
to
be
a
new
foundation
of
simplicity
and
identity
to
each
particular
species
all
depends
on
our
manner
of
viewing
the
objects
when
we
look
along
the
insensible
changes
of
bodies
we
suppose
all
of
them
to
be
of
the
same
substance
or
essence
when
we
consider
their
sensible
differences
we
attribute
to
each
of
them
a
substantial
and
essential
difference
and
in
order
to
indulge
ourselves
in
both
these
ways
of
considering
our
objects
we
suppose
all
bodies
to
have
at
once
a
substance
and
a
substantial
form
the
notion
of
accidents
is
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
this
method
of
thinking
with
regard
to
substances
and
substantial
forms
nor
can
we
forbear
looking
upon
colours
sounds
tastes
figures
and
other
properties
of
bodies
as
existences
which
can
not
subsist
apart
but
require
a
subject
of
inhesion
to
sustain
and
support
them
for
having
never
discovered
any
of
these
sensible
qualities
where
for
the
reasons
we
did
not
likewise
fancy
a
substance
to
exist
the
same
habit
which
makes
us
infer
a
connexion
betwixt
cause
and
effect
makes
us
here
infer
a
dependence
of
every
quality
on
the
unknown
substance
the
custom
of
imagining
a
dependence
has
the
same
effect
as
the
custom
of
observing
it
would
have
this
conceit
however
is
no
more
reasonable
than
any
of
the
foregoing
every
quality
being
a
distinct
thing
from
another
may
be
conceived
to
exist
apart
and
may
exist
apart
not
only
from
every
other
quality
but
from
that
unintelligible
chimera
of
a
substance
but
these
philosophers
carry
their
fictions
still
farther
in
their
sentiments
concerning
occult
qualities
and
both
suppose
a
substance
supporting
which
they
do
not
understand
and
an
accident
supported
of
which
they
have
as
imperfect
an
idea
the
whole
system
therefore
is
entirely
incomprehensible
and
yet
is
derived
from
principles
as
natural
as
any
of
these
in
considering
this
subject
we
may
observe
a
gradation
of
three
opinions
that
rise
above
each
other
according
as
the
persons
who
form
them
acquire
new
degrees
of
reason
and
knowledge
these
opinions
are
that
of
the
vulgar
that
of
a
false
philosophy
and
that
of
the
true
where
we
shall
find
upon
enquiry
that
the
true
philosophy
approaches
nearer
to
the
sentiments
of
the
vulgar
than
to
those
of
a
mistaken
knowledge
it
is
natural
for
men
in
their
common
and
care
less
way
of
thinking
to
imagine
they
perceive
a
connexion
betwixt
such
objects
as
they
have
constantly
found
united
together
and
because
custom
has
rendered
it
difficult
to
separate
the
ideas
they
are
apt
to
fancy
such
a
separation
to
be
in
itself
impossible
and
absurd
but
philosophers
who
abstract
from
the
effects
of
custom
and
compare
the
ideas
of
objects
immediately
perceive
the
falshood
of
these
vulgar
sentiments
and
discover
that
there
is
no
known
connexion
among
objects
every
different
object
appears
to
them
entirely
distinct
and
separate
and
they
perceive
that
it
is
not
from
a
view
of
the
nature
and
qualities
of
objects
we
infer
one
from
another
but
only
when
in
several
instances
we
observe
them
to
have
been
constantly
conjoined
but
these
philosophers
instead
of
drawing
a
just
inference
from
this
observation
and
concluding
that
we
have
no
idea
of
power
or
agency
separate
from
the
mind
and
belonging
to
causes
i
say
instead
of
drawing
this
conclusion
they
frequently
search
for
the
qualities
in
which
this
agency
consists
and
are
displeased
with
every
system
which
their
reason
suggests
to
them
in
order
to
explain
it
they
have
sufficient
force
of
genius
to
free
them
from
the
vulgar
error
that
there
is
a
natural
and
perceivable
connexion
betwixt
the
several
sensible
qualities
and
actions
of
matter
but
not
sufficient
to
keep
them
from
ever
seeking
for
this
connexion
in
matter
or
causes
had
they
fallen
upon
the
just
conclusion
they
would
have
returned
back
to
the
situation
of
the
vulgar
and
would
have
regarded
all
these
disquisitions
with
indolence
and
indifference
at
present
they
seem
to
be
in
a
very
lamentable
condition
and
such
as
the
poets
have
given
us
but
a
faint
notion
of
in
their
descriptions
of
the
punishment
of
sisyphus
and
tantalus
for
what
can
be
imagined
more
tormenting
than
to
seek
with
eagerness
what
for
ever
flies
us
and
seek
for
it
in
a
place
where
it
is
impossible
it
can
ever
exist
but
as
nature
seems
to
have
observed
a
kind
of
justice
and
compensation
in
every
thing
she
has
not
neglected
philosophers
more
than
the
rest
of
the
creation
but
has
reserved
them
a
consolation
amid
all
their
disappointments
and
afflictions
this
consolation
principally
consists
in
their
invention
of
the
words
faculty
and
occult
quality
for
it
being
usual
after
the
frequent
use
of
terms
which
are
really
significant
and
intelligible
to
omit
the
idea
which
we
would
express
by
them
and
to
preserve
only
the
custom
by
which
we
recal
the
idea
at
pleasure
so
it
naturally
happens
that
after
the
frequent
use
of
terms
which
are
wholly
insignificant
and
unintelligible
we
fancy
them
to
be
on
the
same
footing
with
the
precedent
and
to
have
a
secret
meaning
which
we
might
discover
by
reflection
the
resemblance
of
their
appearance
deceives
the
mind
as
is
usual
and
makes
us
imagine
a
thorough
resemblance
and
conformity
by
this
means
these
philosophers
set
themselves
at
ease
and
arrive
at
last
by
an
illusion
at
the
same
indifference
which
the
people
attain
by
their
stupidity
and
true
philosophers
by
their
moderate
scepticism
they
need
only
say
that
any
phenomenon
which
puzzles
them
arises
from
a
faculty
or
an
occult
quality
and
there
is
an
end
of
all
dispute
and
enquiry
upon
the
matter
but
among
all
the
instances
wherein
the
peripatetics
have
shewn
they
were
guided
by
every
trivial
propensity
of
the
imagination
no
one
is
than
their
sympathies
antipathies
and
horrors
of
a
vacuum
there
is
a
very
remarkable
inclination
in
human
nature
to
bestow
on
external
objects
the
same
emotions
which
it
observes
in
itself
and
to
find
every
where
those
ideas
which
are
most
present
to
it
this
inclination
it
is
true
is
suppressed
by
a
little
reflection
and
only
takes
place
in
children
poets
and
the
antient
philosophers
it
appears
in
children
by
their
desire
of
beating
the
stones
which
hurt
them
in
poets
by
their
readiness
to
personify
every
thing
and
in
the
antient
philosophers
by
these
fictions
of
sympathy
and
antipathy
we
must
pardon
children
because
of
their
age
poets
because
they
profess
to
follow
implicitly
the
suggestions
of
their
fancy
but
what
excuse
shall
we
find
to
justify
our
philosophers
in
so
signal
a
weakness
sect
iv
of
the
modern
philosophy
but
here
it
may
be
objected
that
the
imagination
according
to
my
own
confession
being
the
ultimate
judge
of
all
systems
of
philosophy
i
am
unjust
in
blaming
the
antient
philosophers
for
making
use
of
that
faculty
and
allowing
themselves
to
be
entirely
guided
by
it
in
their
reasonings
in
order
to
justify
myself
i
must
distinguish
in
the
imagination
betwixt
the
principles
which
are
permanent
irresistible
and
universal
such
as
the
customary
transition
from
causes
to
effects
and
from
effects
to
causes
and
the
principles
which
are
changeable
weak
and
irregular
such
as
those
i
have
just
now
taken
notice
of
the
former
are
the
foundation
of
all
our
thoughts
and
actions
so
that
upon
their
removal
human
nature
must
immediately
perish
and
go
to
ruin
the
latter
are
neither
unavoidable
to
mankind
nor
necessary
or
so
much
as
useful
in
the
conduct
of
life
but
on
the
contrary
are
observed
only
to
take
place
in
weak
minds
and
being
opposite
to
the
other
principles
of
custom
and
reasoning
may
easily
be
subverted
by
a
due
contrast
and
opposition
for
this
reason
the
former
are
received
by
philosophy
and
the
latter
rejected
one
who
concludes
somebody
to
be
near
him
when
he
hears
an
articulate
voice
in
the
dark
reasons
justly
and
naturally
though
that
conclusion
be
derived
from
nothing
but
custom
which
infixes
and
inlivens
the
idea
of
a
human
creature
on
account
of
his
usual
conjunction
with
the
present
impression
but
one
who
is
tormented
he
knows
not
why
with
the
apprehension
of
spectres
in
the
dark
may
perhaps
be
said
to
reason
and
to
reason
naturally
too
but
then
it
must
be
in
the
same
sense
that
a
malady
is
said
to
be
natural
as
arising
from
natural
causes
though
it
be
contrary
to
health
the
most
agreeable
and
most
natural
situation
of
man
the
opinions
of
the
antient
philosophers
their
fictions
of
substance
and
accident
and
their
reasonings
concerning
substantial
forms
and
occult
qualities
are
like
the
spectres
in
the
dark
and
are
derived
from
principles
which
however
common
are
neither
universal
nor
unavoidable
in
human
nature
the
modern
philosophy
pretends
to
be
entirely
free
from
this
defect
and
to
arise
only
from
the
solid
permanent
and
consistent
principles
of
the
imagination
upon
what
grounds
this
pretension
is
founded
must
now
be
the
subject
of
our
enquiry
the
fundamental
principle
of
that
philosophy
is
the
opinion
concerning
colours
sounds
tastes
smells
heat
and
cold
which
it
asserts
to
be
nothing
but
impressions
in
the
mind
derived
from
the
operation
of
external
objects
and
without
any
resemblance
to
the
qualities
of
the
objects
upon
examination
i
find
only
one
of
the
reasons
commonly
produced
for
this
opinion
to
be
satisfactory
viz
that
derived
from
the
variations
of
those
impressions
even
while
the
external
object
to
all
appearance
continues
the
same
these
variations
depend
upon
several
circumstances
upon
the
different
situations
of
our
health
a
man
in
a
malady
feels
a
disagreeable
taste
in
meats
which
before
pleased
him
the
most
upon
the
different
complexions
and
constitutions
of
men
that
seems
bitter
to
one
which
is
sweet
to
another
upon
the
difference
of
their
external
situation
and
position
colours
reflected
from
the
clouds
change
according
to
the
distance
of
the
clouds
and
according
to
the
angle
they
make
with
the
eye
and
luminous
body
fire
also
communicates
the
sensation
of
pleasure
at
one
distance
and
that
of
pain
at
another
instances
of
this
kind
are
very
numerous
and
frequent
the
conclusion
drawn
from
them
is
likewise
as
satisfactory
as
can
possibly
be
imagined
it
is
certain
that
when
different
impressions
of
the
same
sense
arise
from
any
object
every
one
of
these
impressions
has
not
a
resembling
quality
existent
in
the
object
for
as
the
same
object
can
not
at
the
same
time
be
endowed
with
different
qualities
of
the
same
sense
and
as
the
same
quality
can
not
resemble
impressions
entirely
different
it
evidently
follows
that
many
of
our
impressions
have
no
external
model
or
archetype
now
from
like
effects
we
presume
like
causes
many
of
the
impressions
of
colour
sound
are
confest
to
be
nothing
but
internal
existences
and
to
arise
from
causes
which
no
ways
resemble
them
these
impressions
are
in
appearance
nothing
different
from
the
other
impressions
of
colour
sound
we
conclude
therefore
that
they
are
all
of
them
derived
from
a
like
origin
this
principle
being
once
admitted
all
the
other
doctrines
of
that
philosophy
seem
to
follow
by
an
easy
consequence
for
upon
the
removal
of
sounds
colours
beat
cold
and
other
sensible
qualities
from
the
rank
of
continued
independent
existences
we
are
reduced
merely
to
what
are
called
primary
qualities
as
the
only
real
ones
of
which
we
have
any
adequate
notion
these
primary
qualities
are
extension
and
solidity
with
their
different
mixtures
and
modifications
figure
motion
gravity
and
cohesion
the
generation
encrease
decay
and
corruption
of
animals
and
vegetables
are
nothing
but
changes
of
figure
and
motion
as
also
the
operations
of
all
bodies
on
each
other
of
fire
of
light
water
air
earth
and
of
all
the
elements
and
powers
of
nature
one
figure
and
motion
produces
another
figure
and
motion
nor
does
there
remain
in
the
material
universe
any
other
principle
either
active
or
passive
of
which
we
can
form
the
most
distant
idea
i
believe
many
objections
might
be
made
to
this
system
but
at
present
i
shall
confine
myself
to
one
which
is
in
my
opinion
very
decisive
i
assert
that
instead
of
explaining
the
operations
of
external
objects
by
its
means
we
utterly
annihilate
all
these
objects
and
reduce
ourselves
to
the
opinions
of
the
most
extravagant
scepticism
concerning
them
if
colours
sounds
tastes
and
smells
be
merely
perceptions
nothing
we
can
conceive
is
possest
of
a
real
continued
and
independent
existence
not
even
motion
extension
and
solidity
which
are
the
primary
qualities
chiefly
insisted
on
to
begin
with
the
examination
of
motion
it
is
evident
this
is
a
quality
altogether
inconceivable
alone
and
without
a
reference
to
some
other
object
the
idea
of
motion
necessarily
supposes
that
of
a
body
moving
now
what
is
our
idea
of
the
moving
body
without
which
motion
is
incomprehensible
it
must
resolve
itself
into
the
idea
of
extension
or
of
solidity
and
consequently
the
reality
of
motion
depends
upon
that
of
these
other
qualities
this
opinion
which
is
universally
acknowledged
concerning
motion
i
have
proved
to
be
true
with
regard
to
extension
and
have
shewn
that
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
extension
but
as
composed
of
parts
endowed
with
colour
or
solidity
the
idea
of
extension
is
a
compound
idea
but
as
it
is
not
compounded
of
an
infinite
number
of
parts
or
inferior
ideas
it
must
at
last
resolve
itself
into
such
as
are
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
these
simple
and
indivisible
parts
not
being
ideas
of
extension
must
be
non
entities
unless
conceived
as
coloured
or
solid
colour
is
excluded
from
any
real
existence
the
reality
therefore
of
our
idea
of
extension
depends
upon
the
reality
of
that
of
solidity
nor
can
the
former
be
just
while
the
latter
is
chimerical
let
us
then
lend
our
attention
to
the
examination
of
the
idea
of
solidity
the
idea
of
solidity
is
that
of
two
objects
which
being
impelled
by
the
utmost
force
can
not
penetrate
each
other
but
still
maintain
a
separate
and
distinct
existence
solidity
therefore
is
perfectly
incomprehensible
alone
and
without
the
conception
of
some
bodies
which
are
solid
and
maintain
this
separate
and
distinct
existence
now
what
idea
have
we
of
these
bodies
the
ideas
of
colours
sounds
and
other
secondary
qualities
are
excluded
the
idea
of
motion
depends
on
that
of
extension
and
the
idea
of
extension
on
that
of
solidity
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
the
idea
of
solidity
can
depend
on
either
of
them
for
that
would
be
to
run
in
a
circle
and
make
one
idea
depend
on
another
while
at
the
same
time
the
latter
depends
on
the
former
our
modern
philosophy
therefore
leaves
us
no
just
nor
satisfactory
idea
of
solidity
nor
consequently
of
matter
this
argument
will
appear
entirely
conclusive
to
every
one
that
comprehends
it
but
because
it
may
seem
abstruse
and
intricate
to
the
generality
of
readers
i
hope
to
be
excused
if
i
endeavour
to
render
it
more
obvious
by
some
variation
of
the
expression
in
order
to
form
an
idea
of
solidity
we
must
conceive
two
bodies
pressing
on
each
other
without
any
penetration
and
it
is
impossible
to
arrive
at
this
idea
when
we
confine
ourselves
to
one
object
much
more
without
conceiving
any
two
can
not
exclude
each
other
from
their
places
because
they
never
possess
any
place
nor
can
be
endowed
with
any
quality
now
i
ask
what
idea
do
we
form
of
these
bodies
or
objects
to
which
we
suppose
solidity
to
belong
to
say
that
we
conceive
them
merely
as
solid
is
to
run
on
in
infinitum
to
affirm
that
we
paint
them
out
to
ourselves
as
extended
either
resolves
all
into
a
false
idea
or
returns
in
a
circle
extension
must
necessarily
be
considered
either
as
coloured
which
is
a
false
idea
i
or
as
solid
which
brings
us
back
to
the
first
question
we
may
make
the
same
observation
concerning
mobility
and
figure
and
upon
the
whole
must
conclude
that
after
the
exclusion
of
colours
sounds
heat
and
cold
from
the
rank
of
external
existences
there
remains
nothing
which
can
afford
us
a
just
and
constituent
idea
of
body
add
to
this
that
properly
speaking
solidity
or
impenetrability
is
nothing
but
an
impossibility
of
annihilation
as
part
ii
sect
has
been
already
observed
for
which
reason
it
is
the
more
necessary
for
us
to
form
some
distinct
idea
of
that
object
whose
annihilation
we
suppose
impossible
an
impossibility
of
being
annihilated
can
not
exist
and
can
never
be
conceived
to
exist
by
itself
but
necessarily
requires
some
object
or
real
existence
to
which
it
may
belong
now
the
difficulty
still
remains
how
to
form
an
idea
of
this
object
or
existence
without
having
recourse
to
the
secondary
and
sensible
qualities
nor
must
we
omit
on
this
occasion
our
accustomed
method
of
examining
ideas
by
considering
those
impressions
from
which
they
are
derived
the
impressions
which
enter
by
the
sight
and
hearing
the
smell
and
taste
are
affirmed
by
modern
philosophy
to
be
without
any
resembling
objects
and
consequently
the
idea
of
solidity
which
is
supposed
to
be
real
can
never
be
derived
from
any
of
these
senses
there
remains
therefore
the
feeling
as
the
only
sense
that
can
convey
the
impression
which
is
original
to
the
idea
of
solidity
and
indeed
we
naturally
imagine
that
we
feel
the
solidity
of
bodies
and
need
but
touch
any
object
in
order
to
perceive
this
quality
but
this
method
of
thinking
is
more
popular
than
philosophical
as
will
appear
from
the
following
reflections
first
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
though
bodies
are
felt
by
means
of
their
solidity
yet
the
feeling
is
a
quite
different
thing
from
the
solidity
and
that
they
have
not
the
least
resemblance
to
each
other
a
man
who
has
the
palsey
in
one
hand
has
as
perfect
an
idea
of
impenetrability
when
he
observes
that
hand
to
be
supported
by
the
table
as
when
he
feels
the
same
table
with
the
other
hand
an
object
that
presses
upon
any
of
our
members
meets
with
resistance
and
that
resistance
by
the
motion
it
gives
to
the
nerves
and
animal
spirits
conveys
a
certain
sensation
to
the
mind
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
sensation
motion
and
resistance
are
any
ways
resembling
secondly
the
impressions
of
touch
are
simple
impressions
except
when
considered
with
regard
to
their
extension
which
makes
nothing
to
the
present
purpose
and
from
this
simplicity
i
infer
that
they
neither
represent
solidity
nor
any
real
object
for
let
us
put
two
cases
viz
that
of
a
man
who
presses
a
stone
or
any
solid
body
with
his
hand
and
that
of
two
stones
which
press
each
other
it
will
readily
be
allowed
that
these
two
cases
are
not
in
every
respect
alike
but
that
in
the
former
there
is
conjoined
with
the
solidity
a
feeling
or
sensation
of
which
there
is
no
appearance
in
the
latter
in
order
therefore
to
make
these
two
cases
alike
it
is
necessary
to
remove
some
part
of
the
impression
which
the
man
feels
by
his
hand
or
organ
of
sensation
and
that
being
impossible
in
a
simple
impression
obliges
us
to
remove
the
whole
and
proves
that
this
whole
impression
has
no
archetype
or
model
in
external
objects
to
which
we
may
add
that
solidity
necessarily
supposes
two
bodies
along
with
contiguity
and
impulse
which
being
a
compound
object
can
never
be
represented
by
a
simple
impression
not
to
mention
that
though
solidity
continues
always
invariably
the
same
the
impressions
of
touch
change
every
moment
upon
us
which
is
a
clear
proof
that
the
latter
are
not
representations
of
the
former
thus
there
is
a
direct
and
total
opposition
betwixt
our
reason
and
our
senses
or
more
properly
speaking
betwixt
those
conclusions
we
form
from
cause
and
effect
and
those
that
persuade
us
of
the
continued
and
independent
existence
of
body
when
we
reason
from
cause
and
effect
we
conclude
that
neither
colour
sound
taste
nor
smell
have
a
continued
and
independent
existence
when
we
exclude
these
sensible
qualities
there
remains
nothing
in
the
universe
which
has
such
an
existence
sect
of
the
immateriality
of
the
soul
having
found
such
contradictions
and
difficulties
in
every
system
concerning
external
objects
and
in
the
idea
of
matter
which
we
fancy
so
clear
and
determinate
we
shall
naturally
expect
still
greater
difficulties
and
contradictions
in
every
hypothesis
concerning
our
internal
perceptions
and
the
nature
of
the
mind
which
we
are
apt
to
imagine
so
much
more
obscure
and
uncertain
but
in
this
we
should
deceive
ourselves
the
intellectual
world
though
involved
in
infinite
obscurities
is
not
perplexed
with
any
such
contradictions
as
those
we
have
discovered
in
the
natural
what
is
known
concerning
it
agrees
with
itself
and
what
is
unknown
we
must
be
contented
to
leave
so
it
is
true
would
we
hearken
to
certain
philosophers
they
promise
to
diminish
our
ignorance
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
at
the
hazard
of
running
us
into
contradictions
from
which
the
subject
is
of
itself
exempted
these
philosophers
are
the
curious
reasoners
concerning
the
material
or
immaterial
substances
in
which
they
suppose
our
perceptions
to
inhere
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
these
endless
cavils
on
both
sides
i
know
no
better
method
than
to
ask
these
philosophers
in
a
few
words
what
they
mean
by
substance
and
inhesion
and
after
they
have
answered
this
question
it
will
then
be
reasonable
and
not
till
then
to
enter
seriously
into
the
dispute
this
question
we
have
found
impossible
to
be
answered
with
regard
to
matter
and
body
but
besides
that
in
the
case
of
the
mind
it
labours
under
all
the
same
difficulties
it
is
burthened
with
some
additional
ones
which
are
peculiar
to
that
subject
as
every
idea
is
derived
from
a
precedent
impression
had
we
any
idea
of
the
substance
of
our
minds
we
must
also
have
an
impression
of
it
which
is
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
be
conceived
for
how
can
an
impression
represent
a
substance
otherwise
than
by
resembling
it
and
how
can
an
impression
resemble
a
substance
since
according
to
this
philosophy
it
is
not
a
substance
and
has
none
of
the
peculiar
qualities
or
characteristics
of
a
substance
but
leaving
the
question
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
for
that
other
what
actually
is
i
desire
those
philosophers
who
pretend
that
we
have
an
idea
of
the
substance
of
our
minds
to
point
out
the
impression
that
produces
it
and
tell
distinctly
after
what
manner
that
impression
operates
and
from
what
object
it
is
derived
is
it
an
impression
of
sensation
or
of
reflection
is
it
pleasant
or
painful
or
indifferent
i
does
it
attend
us
at
all
times
or
does
it
only
return
at
intervals
if
at
intervals
at
what
times
principally
does
it
return
and
by
what
causes
is
it
produced
if
instead
of
answering
these
questions
any
one
should
evade
the
difficulty
by
saying
that
the
definition
of
a
substance
is
something
which
may
exist
by
itself
and
that
this
definition
ought
to
satisfy
us
should
this
be
said
i
should
observe
that
this
definition
agrees
to
every
thing
that
can
possibly
be
conceived
and
never
will
serve
to
distinguish
substance
from
accident
or
the
soul
from
its
perceptions
for
thus
i
reason
whatever
is
clearly
conceived
may
exist
and
whatever
is
clearly
conceived
after
any
manner
may
exist
after
the
same
manner
this
is
one
principle
which
has
been
already
acknowledged
again
every
thing
which
is
different
is
distinguishable
and
every
thing
which
is
distinguishable
is
separable
by
the
imagination
this
is
another
principle
my
conclusion
from
both
is
that
since
all
our
perceptions
are
different
from
each
other
and
from
every
thing
else
in
the
universe
they
are
also
distinct
and
separable
and
may
be
considered
as
separately
existent
and
may
exist
separately
and
have
no
need
of
any
thing
else
to
support
their
existence
they
are
therefore
substances
as
far
as
this
definition
explains
a
substance
thus
neither
by
considering
the
first
origin
of
ideas
nor
by
means
of
a
definition
are
we
able
to
arrive
at
any
satisfactory
notion
of
substance
which
seems
to
me
a
sufficient
reason
for
abandoning
utterly
that
dispute
concerning
the
materiality
and
immateriality
of
the
soul
and
makes
me
absolutely
condemn
even
the
question
itself
we
have
no
perfect
idea
of
any
thing
but
of
a
perception
a
substance
is
entirely
different
from
a
perception
we
have
therefore
no
idea
of
a
substance
inhesion
in
something
is
supposed
to
be
requisite
to
support
the
existence
of
our
perceptions
nothing
appears
requisite
to
support
the
existence
of
a
perception
we
have
therefore
no
idea
of
inhesion
what
possibility
then
of
answering
that
question
whether
perceptions
inhere
in
a
material
or
immaterial
substance
when
we
do
not
so
much
as
understand
the
meaning
of
the
question
there
is
one
argument
commonly
employed
for
the
immateriality
of
the
soul
which
seems
to
me
remarkable
whatever
is
extended
consists
of
parts
and
whatever
consists
of
parts
is
divisible
if
not
in
reality
at
least
in
the
imagination
but
it
is
impossible
anything
divisible
can
be
conjoined
to
a
thought
or
perception
which
is
a
being
altogether
inseparable
and
indivisible
for
supposing
such
a
conjunction
would
the
indivisible
thought
exist
on
the
left
or
on
the
right
hand
of
this
extended
divisible
body
on
the
surface
or
in
the
middle
on
the
back
or
fore
side
of
it
if
it
be
conjoined
with
the
extension
it
must
exist
somewhere
within
its
dimensions
if
it
exist
within
its
dimensions
it
must
either
exist
in
one
particular
part
and
then
that
particular
part
is
indivisible
and
the
perception
is
conjoined
only
with
it
not
with
the
extension
or
if
the
thought
exists
in
every
part
it
must
also
be
extended
and
separable
and
divisible
as
well
as
the
body
which
is
utterly
absurd
and
contradictory
for
can
any
one
conceive
a
passion
of
a
yard
in
length
a
foot
in
breadth
and
an
inch
in
thickness
thought
therefore
and
extension
are
qualities
wholly
incompatible
and
never
can
incorporate
together
into
one
subject
this
argument
affects
not
the
question
concerning
the
substance
of
the
soul
but
only
that
concerning
its
local
conjunction
with
matter
and
therefore
it
may
not
be
improper
to
consider
in
general
what
objects
are
or
are
not
susceptible
of
a
local
conjunction
this
is
a
curious
question
and
may
lead
us
to
some
discoveries
of
considerable
moment
the
first
notion
of
space
and
extension
is
derived
solely
from
the
senses
of
sight
and
feeling
nor
is
there
any
thing
but
what
is
coloured
or
tangible
that
has
parts
disposed
after
such
a
manner
as
to
convey
that
idea
when
we
diminish
or
encrease
a
relish
it
is
not
after
the
same
manner
that
we
diminish
or
encrease
any
visible
object
and
when
several
sounds
strike
our
hearing
at
once
custom
and
reflection
alone
make
us
form
an
idea
of
the
degrees
of
the
distance
and
contiguity
of
those
bodies
from
which
they
are
derived
whatever
marks
the
place
of
its
existence
either
must
be
extended
or
must
be
a
mathematical
point
without
parts
or
composition
what
is
extended
must
have
a
particular
figure
as
square
round
triangular
none
of
which
will
agree
to
a
desire
or
indeed
to
any
impression
or
idea
except
to
these
two
senses
neither
ought
a
desire
though
indivisible
to
be
considered
as
a
mathematical
point
for
in
that
case
it
would
be
possible
by
the
addition
of
others
to
make
two
three
four
desires
and
these
disposed
and
situated
in
such
a
manner
as
to
have
a
determinate
length
breadth
and
thickness
which
is
evidently
absurd
it
will
not
be
surprising
after
this
if
i
deliver
a
maxim
which
is
condemned
by
several
metaphysicians
and
is
esteemed
contrary
to
the
most
certain
principles
of
hum
reason
this
maxim
is
that
an
object
may
exist
and
yet
be
no
where
and
i
assert
that
this
is
not
only
possible
but
that
the
greatest
part
of
beings
do
and
must
exist
after
this
manner
an
object
may
be
said
to
be
no
where
when
its
parts
are
not
so
situated
with
respect
to
each
other
as
to
form
any
figure
or
quantity
nor
the
whole
with
respect
to
other
bodies
so
as
to
answer
to
our
notions
of
contiguity
or
distance
now
this
is
evidently
the
case
with
all
our
perceptions
and
objects
except
those
of
the
sight
and
feeling
a
moral
reflection
can
not
be
placed
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
hand
of
a
passion
nor
can
a
smell
or
sound
be
either
of
a
circular
or
a
square
figure
these
objects
and
perceptions
so
far
from
requiring
any
particular
place
are
absolutely
incompatible
with
it
and
even
the
imagination
can
not
attribute
it
to
them
and
as
to
the
absurdity
of
supposing
them
to
be
no
where
we
may
consider
that
if
the
passions
and
sentiments
appear
to
the
perception
to
have
any
particular
place
the
idea
of
extension
might
be
derived
from
them
as
well
as
from
the
sight
and
touch
contrary
to
what
we
have
already
established
if
they
appear
not
to
have
any
particular
place
they
may
possibly
exist
in
the
same
manner
since
whatever
we
conceive
is
possible
it
will
not
now
be
necessary
to
prove
that
those
perceptions
which
are
simple
and
exist
no
where
are
incapable
of
any
conjunction
in
place
with
matter
or
body
which
is
extended
and
divisible
since
it
is
impossible
to
found
a
relation
but
on
some
common
quality
it
may
be
better
worth
our
while
to
remark
that
this
question
of
the
local
conjunction
of
objects
does
not
only
occur
in
metaphysical
disputes
concerning
the
nature
of
the
soul
but
that
even
in
common
life
we
have
every
moment
occasion
to
examine
it
thus
supposing
we
consider
a
fig
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
an
olive
at
the
other
it
is
evident
that
in
forming
the
complex
ideas
of
these
substances
one
of
the
most
obvious
is
that
of
their
different
relishes
and
it
is
as
evident
that
we
incorporate
and
conjoin
these
qualities
with
such
as
are
coloured
and
tangible
the
bitter
taste
of
the
one
and
sweet
of
the
other
are
supposed
to
lie
in
the
very
visible
body
and
to
be
separated
from
each
other
by
the
whole
length
of
the
table
this
is
so
notable
and
so
natural
an
illusion
that
it
may
be
proper
to
consider
the
principles
from
which
it
is
derived
though
an
extended
object
be
incapable
of
a
conjunction
in
place
with
another
that
exists
without
any
place
or
extension
yet
are
they
susceptible
of
many
other
relations
thus
the
taste
and
smell
of
any
fruit
are
inseparable
from
its
other
qualities
of
colour
and
tangibility
and
whichever
of
them
be
the
cause
or
effect
it
is
certain
they
are
always
nor
are
they
only
in
general
but
also
in
their
appearance
in
the
mind
and
it
is
upon
the
application
of
the
extended
body
to
our
senses
we
perceive
its
particular
taste
and
smell
these
relations
then
of
causation
and
contiguity
in
the
time
of
their
appearance
betwixt
the
extended
object
and
the
quality
which
exists
without
any
particular
place
must
have
such
an
effect
on
the
mind
that
upon
the
appearance
of
one
it
will
immediately
turn
its
thought
to
the
conception
of
the
other
nor
is
this
all
we
not
only
turn
our
thought
from
one
to
the
other
upon
account
of
their
relation
but
likewise
endeavour
to
give
them
a
new
relation
viz
that
of
a
conjunction
in
place
that
we
may
render
the
transition
more
easy
and
natural
for
it
is
a
quality
which
i
shall
often
have
occasion
to
remark
in
human
nature
and
shall
explain
more
fully
in
its
proper
place
that
when
objects
are
united
by
any
relation
we
have
a
strong
propensity
to
add
some
new
relation
to
them
in
order
to
compleat
the
union
in
our
arrangement
of
bodies
we
never
fail
to
place
such
as
are
resembling
in
contiguity
to
each
other
or
at
least
in
correspondent
points
of
view
why
but
because
we
feel
a
satisfaction
in
joining
the
relation
of
contiguity
to
that
of
resemblance
or
the
resemblance
of
situation
to
that
of
qualities
the
effects
this
propensity
have
been
sect
towards
the
end
already
observed
in
that
resemblance
which
we
so
readily
suppose
betwixt
particular
impressions
and
their
external
causes
but
we
shall
not
find
a
more
evident
effect
of
it
than
in
the
present
instance
where
from
the
relations
of
causation
and
contiguity
in
time
betwixt
two
objects
we
feign
likewise
that
of
a
conjunction
in
place
in
order
to
strengthen
the
connexion
but
whatever
confused
notions
we
may
form
of
an
union
in
place
betwixt
an
extended
body
as
a
fig
and
its
particular
taste
it
is
certain
that
upon
reflection
we
must
observe
this
union
something
altogether
unintelligible
and
contradictory
for
should
we
ask
ourselves
one
obvious
question
viz
if
the
taste
which
we
conceive
to
be
contained
in
the
circumference
of
the
body
is
in
every
part
of
it
or
in
one
only
we
must
quickly
find
ourselves
at
a
loss
and
perceive
the
impossibility
of
ever
giving
a
satisfactory
answer
we
can
not
rely
that
it
is
only
in
one
part
for
experience
convinces
us
that
every
part
has
the
same
relish
we
can
as
little
reply
that
it
exists
in
every
part
for
then
we
must
suppose
it
figured
and
extended
which
is
absurd
and
incomprehensible
here
then
we
are
influenced
by
two
principles
directly
contrary
to
each
other
viz
that
inclination
of
our
fancy
by
which
we
are
determined
to
incorporate
the
taste
with
the
extended
object
and
our
reason
which
shows
us
the
impossibility
of
such
an
union
being
divided
betwixt
these
opposite
principles
we
renounce
neither
one
nor
the
other
but
involve
the
subject
in
such
confusion
and
obscurity
that
we
no
longer
perceive
the
opposition
we
suppose
that
the
taste
exists
within
the
circumference
of
the
body
but
in
such
a
manner
that
it
fills
the
whole
without
extension
and
exists
entire
in
every
part
without
separation
in
short
we
use
in
our
most
familiar
way
of
thinking
that
scholastic
principle
which
when
crudely
proposed
appears
so
shocking
of
totum
in
toto
tolum
in
qualibet
parte
which
is
much
the
same
as
if
we
should
say
that
a
thing
is
in
a
certain
place
and
yet
is
not
there
all
this
absurdity
proceeds
from
our
endeavouring
to
bestow
a
place
on
what
is
utterly
incapable
of
it
and
that
endeavour
again
arises
from
our
inclination
to
compleat
an
union
which
is
founded
on
causation
and
a
contiguity
of
time
by
attributing
to
the
objects
a
conjunction
in
place
but
if
ever
reason
be
of
sufficient
force
to
overcome
prejudice
it
is
certain
that
in
the
present
case
it
must
prevail
for
we
have
only
this
choice
left
either
to
suppose
that
some
beings
exist
without
any
place
or
that
they
are
figured
and
extended
or
that
when
they
are
incorporated
with
extended
objects
the
whole
is
in
the
whole
and
the
whole
in
every
part
the
absurdity
of
the
two
last
suppositions
proves
sufficiently
the
veracity
of
the
first
nor
is
there
any
fourth
opinion
for
as
to
the
supposition
of
their
existence
in
the
manner
of
mathematical
points
it
resolves
itself
into
the
second
opinion
and
supposes
that
several
passions
may
be
placed
in
a
circular
figure
and
that
a
certain
number
of
smells
conjoined
with
a
certain
number
of
sounds
may
make
a
body
of
twelve
cubic
inches
which
appears
ridiculous
upon
the
bare
mentioning
of
it
but
though
in
this
view
of
things
we
can
not
refuse
to
condemn
the
materialists
who
conjoin
all
thought
with
extension
yet
a
little
reflection
will
show
us
equal
reason
for
blaming
their
antagonists
who
conjoin
all
thought
with
a
simple
and
indivisible
substance
the
most
vulgar
philosophy
informs
us
that
no
external
object
can
make
itself
known
to
the
mind
immediately
and
without
the
interposition
of
an
image
or
perception
that
table
which
just
now
appears
to
me
is
only
a
perception
and
all
its
qualities
are
qualities
of
a
perception
now
the
most
obvious
of
all
its
qualities
is
extension
the
perception
consists
of
parts
these
parts
are
so
situated
as
to
afford
us
the
notion
of
distance
and
contiguity
of
length
breadth
and
thickness
the
termination
of
these
three
dimensions
is
what
we
call
figure
this
figure
is
moveable
separable
and
divisible
mobility
and
separability
are
the
distinguishing
properties
of
extended
objects
and
to
cut
short
all
disputes
the
very
idea
of
extension
is
copyed
from
nothing
but
an
impression
and
consequently
must
perfectly
agree
to
it
to
say
the
idea
of
extension
agrees
to
any
thing
is
to
say
it
is
extended
the
may
now
triumph
in
his
turn
and
having
found
there
are
impressions
and
ideas
really
extended
may
ask
his
antagonists
how
they
can
incorporate
a
simple
and
indivisible
subject
with
an
extended
perception
all
the
arguments
of
theologians
may
here
be
retorted
upon
them
is
the
indivisible
subject
or
immaterial
substance
if
you
will
on
the
left
or
on
the
right
hand
of
the
perception
is
it
in
this
particular
part
or
in
that
other
is
it
in
every
part
without
being
extended
or
is
it
entire
in
any
one
part
without
deserting
the
rest
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
answer
to
these
questions
but
what
will
both
be
absurd
in
itself
and
will
account
for
the
union
of
our
indivisible
perceptions
with
an
extended
substance
this
gives
me
an
occasion
to
take
into
consideration
the
question
concerning
the
substance
of
the
soul
and
though
i
have
condemned
that
question
as
utterly
unintelligible
yet
i
can
not
forbear
proposing
some
farther
reflections
concerning
it
i
assert
that
the
doctrine
of
the
immateriality
simplicity
and
indivisibility
of
a
thinking
substance
is
a
true
atheism
and
will
serve
to
justify
all
those
sentiments
for
which
spinoza
is
so
universally
infamous
from
this
topic
i
hope
at
least
to
reap
one
advantage
that
my
adversaries
will
not
have
any
pretext
to
render
the
present
doctrine
odious
by
their
declamations
when
they
see
that
they
can
be
so
easily
retorted
on
them
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
atheism
of
spinoza
is
the
doctrine
of
the
simplicity
of
the
universe
and
the
unity
of
that
substance
in
which
he
supposes
both
thought
and
matter
to
inhere
there
is
only
one
substance
says
he
in
the
world
and
that
substance
is
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
and
exists
every
where
without
any
local
presence
whatever
we
discover
externally
by
sensation
whatever
we
feel
internally
by
reflection
all
these
are
nothing
but
modifications
of
that
one
simple
and
necessarily
existent
being
and
are
not
possest
of
any
separate
or
distinct
existence
every
passion
of
the
soul
every
configuration
of
matter
however
different
and
various
inhere
in
the
same
substance
and
preserve
in
themselves
their
characters
of
distinction
without
communicating
them
to
that
subject
in
which
they
inhere
the
same
substratum
if
i
may
so
speak
supports
the
most
different
modifications
without
any
difference
in
itself
and
varies
them
without
any
variation
neither
time
nor
place
nor
all
the
diversity
of
nature
are
able
to
produce
any
composition
or
change
in
its
perfect
simplicity
and
identity
i
believe
this
brief
exposition
of
the
principles
of
that
famous
atheist
will
be
sufficient
for
the
present
purpose
and
that
without
entering
farther
into
these
gloomy
and
obscure
regions
i
shall
be
able
to
shew
that
this
hideous
hypothesis
is
almost
the
same
with
that
of
the
immateriality
of
the
soul
which
has
become
so
popular
to
make
this
evident
let
us
part
ii
sect
remember
that
as
every
idea
is
derived
from
a
preceding
perception
it
is
impossible
our
idea
of
a
perception
and
that
of
an
object
or
external
existence
can
ever
represent
what
are
specifically
different
from
each
other
whatever
difference
we
may
suppose
betwixt
them
it
is
still
incomprehensible
to
us
and
we
are
obliged
either
to
conceive
an
external
object
merely
as
a
relation
without
a
relative
or
to
make
it
the
very
same
with
a
perception
or
impression
the
consequence
i
shall
draw
from
this
may
at
first
sight
appear
a
mere
sophism
but
upon
the
least
examination
will
be
found
solid
and
satisfactory
i
say
then
that
since
we
may
suppose
but
never
can
conceive
a
specific
deference
betwixt
an
object
and
impression
any
conclusion
we
form
concerning
the
connexion
and
repugnance
of
impressions
will
not
be
known
certainly
to
be
applicable
to
objects
but
that
on
the
other
hand
whatever
conclusions
of
this
kind
we
form
concerning
objects
will
most
certainly
be
applicable
to
impressions
the
reason
is
not
difficult
as
an
object
is
supposed
to
be
different
from
an
impression
we
can
not
be
sure
that
the
circumstance
upon
which
we
found
our
reasoning
is
common
to
both
supposing
we
form
the
reasoning
upon
the
impression
it
is
still
possible
that
the
object
may
differ
from
it
in
that
particular
but
when
we
first
form
our
reasoning
concerning
the
object
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
the
same
reasoning
must
extend
to
the
impression
and
that
because
the
quality
of
the
object
upon
which
the
argument
is
founded
must
at
least
be
conceived
by
the
mind
and
coued
not
be
conceived
unless
it
were
common
to
an
impression
since
we
have
no
idea
but
what
is
derived
from
that
origin
thus
we
may
establish
it
as
a
certain
maxim
that
we
can
never
by
any
principle
but
by
an
irregular
kind
such
as
that
of
sect
form
the
coherence
of
our
perceptions
of
reasoning
from
experience
discover
a
connexion
or
repugnance
betwixt
objects
which
extends
not
to
impressions
though
the
inverse
proposition
may
not
be
equally
true
that
all
the
discoverable
relations
of
impressions
are
common
to
objects
to
apply
this
to
the
present
case
there
are
two
different
systems
of
being
presented
to
which
i
suppose
myself
under
necessity
of
assigning
some
substance
or
ground
of
inhesion
i
observe
first
the
universe
of
objects
or
of
body
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
earth
seas
plants
animals
men
ships
houses
and
other
productions
either
of
art
or
nature
here
spinoza
appears
and
tells
me
that
these
are
only
modifications
and
that
the
subject
in
which
they
inhere
is
simple
incompounded
and
indivisible
after
this
i
consider
the
other
system
of
beings
viz
the
universe
of
thought
or
my
impressions
and
ideas
there
i
observe
another
sun
moon
and
stars
an
earth
and
seas
covered
and
inhabited
by
plants
and
animals
towns
houses
mountains
rivers
and
in
short
every
thing
i
can
discover
or
conceive
in
the
first
system
upon
my
enquiring
concerning
these
theologians
present
themselves
and
tell
me
that
these
also
are
modifications
and
modifications
of
one
simple
uncompounded
and
indivisible
substance
immediately
upon
which
i
am
deafened
with
the
noise
of
a
hundred
voices
that
treat
the
first
hypothesis
with
detestation
and
scorn
and
the
second
with
applause
and
veneration
i
turn
my
attention
to
these
hypotheses
to
see
what
may
be
the
reason
of
so
great
a
partiality
and
find
that
they
have
the
same
fault
of
being
unintelligible
and
that
as
far
as
we
can
understand
them
they
are
so
much
alike
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
any
absurdity
in
one
which
is
not
common
to
both
of
them
we
have
no
idea
of
any
quality
in
an
object
which
does
not
agree
to
and
may
not
represent
a
quality
in
an
impression
and
that
because
all
our
ideas
are
derived
from
our
impressions
we
can
never
therefore
find
any
repugnance
betwixt
an
extended
object
as
a
modification
and
a
simple
uncompounded
essence
as
its
substance
unless
that
repugnance
takes
place
equally
betwixt
the
perception
or
impression
of
that
extended
object
and
the
same
uncompounded
essence
every
idea
of
a
quality
in
an
object
passes
through
an
impression
and
therefore
every
perceivable
relation
whether
of
connexion
or
repugnance
must
be
common
both
to
objects
and
impressions
but
though
this
argument
considered
in
general
seems
evident
beyond
all
doubt
and
contradiction
yet
to
make
it
more
clear
and
sensible
let
us
survey
it
in
detail
and
see
whether
all
the
absurdities
which
have
been
found
in
the
system
of
spinoza
may
not
likewise
be
discovered
in
that
of
theologians
see
bayle
dictionary
article
of
spinoza
first
it
has
been
said
against
spinoza
according
to
the
scholastic
way
of
talking
rather
than
thinking
that
a
mode
not
being
any
distinct
or
separate
existence
must
be
the
very
same
with
its
substance
and
consequently
the
extension
of
the
universe
must
be
in
a
manner
identifyed
with
that
simple
uncompounded
essence
in
which
the
universe
is
supposed
to
inhere
but
this
it
may
be
pretended
is
utterly
impossible
and
inconceivable
unless
the
indivisible
substance
expand
itself
so
as
to
correspond
to
the
extension
or
the
extension
contract
itself
so
as
to
answer
to
the
indivisible
substance
this
argument
seems
just
as
far
as
we
can
understand
it
and
it
is
plain
nothing
is
required
but
a
change
in
the
terms
to
apply
the
same
argument
to
our
extended
perceptions
and
the
simple
essence
of
the
soul
the
ideas
of
objects
and
perceptions
being
in
every
respect
the
same
only
attended
with
the
supposition
of
a
difference
that
is
unknown
and
incomprehensible
secondly
it
has
been
said
that
we
have
no
idea
of
substance
which
is
not
applicable
to
matter
nor
any
idea
of
a
distinct
substance
which
is
not
applicable
to
every
distinct
portion
of
matter
matter
therefore
is
not
a
mode
but
a
substance
and
each
part
of
matter
is
not
a
distinct
mode
but
a
distinct
substance
i
have
already
proved
that
we
have
no
perfect
idea
of
substance
but
that
taking
it
for
something
that
can
exist
by
itself
it
is
evident
every
perception
is
a
substance
and
every
distinct
part
of
a
perception
a
distinct
substance
and
consequently
the
one
hypothesis
labours
under
the
same
difficulties
in
this
respect
with
the
other
thirdly
it
has
been
objected
to
the
system
of
one
simple
substance
in
the
universe
that
this
substance
being
the
support
or
substratum
of
every
thing
must
at
the
very
same
instant
be
modifyed
into
forms
which
are
contrary
and
incompatible
the
round
and
square
figures
are
incompatible
in
the
same
substance
at
the
same
time
how
then
is
it
possible
that
the
same
substance
can
at
once
be
modifyed
into
that
square
table
and
into
this
round
one
i
ask
the
same
question
concerning
the
impressions
of
these
tables
and
find
that
the
answer
is
no
more
satisfactory
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
it
appears
then
that
to
whatever
side
we
turn
the
same
difficulties
follow
us
and
that
we
can
not
advance
one
step
towards
the
establishing
the
simplicity
and
immateriality
o
the
soul
without
preparing
the
way
for
a
dangerous
and
irrecoverable
atheism
it
is
the
same
case
if
instead
o
calling
thought
a
modification
of
the
soul
we
should
give
it
the
more
antient
and
yet
more
modish
name
of
an
action
by
an
action
we
mean
much
the
same
thing
as
what
is
commonly
called
an
abstract
mode
that
is
something
which
properly
speaking
is
neither
distinguishable
nor
separable
from
its
substance
and
is
only
conceived
by
a
distinction
of
reason
or
an
abstraction
but
nothing
is
gained
by
this
change
of
the
term
of
modification
for
that
of
action
nor
do
we
free
ourselves
from
one
single
difficulty
by
its
means
as
will
appear
from
the
two
following
reflexions
first
i
observe
that
the
word
action
according
to
this
explication
of
it
can
never
justly
be
applied
to
any
perception
as
derived
from
a
mind
or
thinking
substance
our
perceptions
are
all
really
different
and
separable
and
distinguishable
from
each
other
and
from
everything
else
which
we
can
imagine
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
how
they
can
be
the
action
or
abstract
mode
of
any
substance
the
instance
of
motion
which
is
commonly
made
use
of
to
shew
after
what
manner
perception
depends
as
an
action
upon
its
substance
rather
confounds
than
instructs
us
motion
to
all
appearance
induces
no
real
nor
essential
change
on
the
body
but
only
varies
its
relation
to
other
objects
but
betwixt
a
person
in
the
morning
walking
a
garden
with
company
agreeable
to
him
and
a
person
in
the
afternoon
inclosed
in
a
dungeon
and
full
of
terror
despair
and
resentment
there
seems
to
be
a
radical
difference
and
of
quite
another
kind
than
what
is
produced
on
a
body
by
the
change
of
its
situation
as
we
conclude
from
the
distinction
and
separability
of
their
ideas
that
external
objects
have
a
separate
existence
from
each
other
so
when
we
make
these
ideas
themselves
our
objects
we
must
draw
the
same
conclusion
concerning
them
according
to
the
precedent
reasoning
at
least
it
must
be
confest
that
having
idea
of
the
substance
of
the
soul
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
tell
how
it
can
admit
of
such
differences
and
even
contrarieties
of
perception
without
any
fundamental
change
and
consequently
can
never
tell
in
what
sense
perceptions
are
actions
of
that
substance
the
use
therefore
of
the
word
action
unaccompanyed
with
any
meaning
instead
of
that
of
modification
makes
no
addition
to
our
knowledge
nor
is
of
any
advantage
to
the
doctrine
of
the
immateriality
of
the
soul
i
add
in
the
second
place
that
if
it
brings
any
advantage
to
that
cause
it
must
bring
an
equal
to
the
cause
of
atheism
for
do
our
theologians
pretend
to
make
a
monopoly
of
the
word
action
and
may
not
the
atheists
likewise
take
possession
of
it
and
affirm
that
plants
animals
men
are
nothing
but
particular
actions
of
one
simple
universal
substance
which
exerts
itself
from
a
blind
and
absolute
necessity
this
you
say
is
utterly
absurd
i
own
it
is
unintelligible
but
at
the
same
time
assert
according
to
the
principles
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
any
absurdity
in
the
supposition
that
all
the
various
objects
in
nature
are
actions
of
one
simple
substance
which
absurdity
will
not
be
applicable
to
a
like
supposition
concerning
impressions
and
ideas
from
these
hypotheses
concerning
the
substance
and
local
conjunction
of
our
perceptions
we
may
pass
to
another
which
is
more
intelligible
than
the
former
and
more
important
than
the
latter
viz
concerning
the
cause
of
our
perceptions
matter
and
motion
it
is
commonly
said
in
the
schools
however
varyed
are
still
matter
and
motion
and
produce
only
a
difference
in
the
position
and
situation
of
objects
divide
a
body
as
often
as
you
please
it
is
still
body
place
it
in
any
figure
nothing
ever
results
but
figure
or
the
relation
of
parts
move
it
in
any
manner
you
still
find
motion
or
a
change
of
relation
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
that
motion
in
a
circle
for
instance
should
be
nothing
but
merely
motion
in
a
circle
while
motion
in
another
direction
as
in
an
ellipse
should
also
be
a
passion
or
moral
reflection
that
the
shocking
of
two
globular
particles
should
become
a
sensation
of
pain
and
that
the
meeting
of
two
triangular
ones
should
afford
a
pleasure
now
as
these
different
shocks
and
variations
and
mixtures
are
the
only
changes
of
which
matter
is
susceptible
and
as
these
never
afford
us
any
idea
of
thought
or
perception
it
is
concluded
to
be
impossible
that
thought
can
ever
be
caused
by
matter
few
have
been
able
to
withstand
the
seeming
evidence
of
this
argument
and
yet
nothing
in
the
world
is
more
easy
than
to
refute
it
we
need
only
reflect
on
what
has
been
proved
at
large
that
we
are
never
sensible
of
any
connexion
betwixt
causes
and
effects
and
that
it
is
only
by
our
experience
of
their
constant
conjunction
we
can
arrive
at
any
knowledge
of
this
relation
now
as
all
objects
which
are
not
contrary
are
susceptible
of
a
constant
conjunction
and
as
no
real
objects
are
contrary
part
iii
sect
i
have
inferred
from
these
principles
that
to
consider
the
matter
a
priori
any
thing
may
produce
any
thing
and
that
we
shall
never
discover
a
reason
why
any
object
may
or
may
not
be
the
cause
of
any
other
however
great
or
however
little
the
resemblance
may
be
betwixt
them
this
evidently
destroys
the
precedent
reasoning
concerning
the
cause
of
thought
or
perception
for
though
there
appear
no
manner
of
connexion
betwixt
motion
or
thought
the
case
is
the
same
with
all
other
causes
and
effects
place
one
body
of
a
pound
weight
on
one
end
of
a
lever
and
another
body
of
the
same
weight
on
another
end
you
will
never
find
in
these
bodies
any
principle
of
motion
dependent
on
their
distances
from
the
center
more
than
of
thought
and
perception
if
you
pretend
therefore
to
prove
a
priori
that
such
a
position
of
bodies
can
never
cause
thought
because
turn
it
which
way
you
will
it
is
nothing
but
a
position
of
bodies
you
must
by
the
same
course
of
reasoning
conclude
that
it
can
never
produce
motion
since
there
is
no
more
apparent
connexion
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
but
as
this
latter
conclusion
is
contrary
to
evident
experience
and
as
it
is
possible
we
may
have
a
like
experience
in
the
operations
of
the
mind
and
may
perceive
a
constant
conjunction
of
thought
and
motion
you
reason
too
hastily
when
from
the
mere
consideration
of
the
ideas
you
conclude
that
it
is
impossible
motion
can
ever
produce
thought
or
a
different
position
of
parts
give
rise
to
a
different
passion
or
reflection
nay
it
is
not
only
possible
we
may
have
such
an
experience
but
it
is
certain
we
have
it
since
every
one
may
perceive
that
the
different
dispositions
of
his
body
change
his
thoughts
and
sentiments
and
should
it
be
said
that
this
depends
on
the
union
of
soul
and
body
i
would
answer
that
we
must
separate
the
question
concerning
the
substance
of
the
mind
from
that
concerning
the
cause
of
its
thought
and
that
confining
ourselves
to
the
latter
question
we
find
by
the
comparing
their
ideas
that
thought
and
motion
are
different
from
each
other
and
by
experience
that
they
are
constantly
united
which
being
all
the
circumstances
that
enter
into
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
when
applied
to
the
operations
of
matter
we
may
certainly
conclude
that
motion
may
be
and
actually
is
the
cause
of
thought
and
perception
there
seems
only
this
dilemma
left
us
in
the
present
case
either
to
assert
that
nothing
can
be
the
cause
of
another
but
where
the
mind
can
perceive
the
connexion
in
its
idea
of
the
objects
or
to
maintain
that
all
objects
which
we
find
constantly
conjoined
are
upon
that
account
to
be
regarded
as
causes
and
effects
if
we
choose
the
first
part
of
the
dilemma
these
are
the
consequences
first
we
in
reality
affirm
that
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
universe
as
a
cause
or
productive
principle
not
even
the
deity
himself
since
our
idea
of
that
supreme
being
is
derived
from
particular
impressions
none
of
which
contain
any
efficacy
nor
seem
to
have
any
connexion
with
any
other
existence
as
to
what
may
be
said
that
the
connexion
betwixt
the
idea
of
an
infinitely
powerful
being
and
that
of
any
effect
which
he
wills
is
necessary
and
unavoidable
i
answer
that
we
have
no
idea
of
a
being
endowed
with
any
power
much
less
of
one
endowed
with
infinite
power
but
if
we
will
change
expressions
we
can
only
define
power
by
connexion
and
then
in
saying
that
the
idea
of
an
infinitely
powerful
being
is
connected
with
that
of
every
effect
which
he
wills
we
really
do
no
more
than
assert
that
a
being
whose
volition
is
connected
with
every
effect
is
connected
with
every
effect
which
is
an
identical
proposition
and
gives
us
no
insight
into
the
nature
of
this
power
or
connexion
but
secondly
supposing
that
the
deity
were
the
great
and
efficacious
principle
which
supplies
the
deficiency
of
all
causes
this
leads
us
into
the
grossest
impieties
and
absurdities
for
upon
the
same
account
that
we
have
recourse
to
him
in
natural
operations
and
assert
that
matter
can
not
of
itself
communicate
motion
or
produce
thought
viz
because
there
is
no
apparent
connexion
betwixt
these
objects
i
say
upon
the
very
same
account
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
deity
is
the
author
of
all
our
volitions
and
perceptions
since
they
have
no
more
apparent
connexion
either
with
one
another
or
with
the
supposed
but
unknown
substance
of
the
soul
this
agency
of
the
supreme
being
we
know
to
have
been
asserted
by
as
father
malebranche
and
other
cartesians
several
philosophers
with
relation
to
all
the
actions
of
the
mind
except
volition
or
rather
an
inconsiderable
part
of
volition
though
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
this
exception
is
a
mere
pretext
to
avoid
the
dangerous
consequences
of
that
doctrine
if
nothing
be
active
but
what
has
an
apparent
power
thought
is
in
no
case
any
more
active
than
matter
and
if
this
inactivity
must
make
us
have
recourse
to
a
deity
the
supreme
being
is
the
real
cause
of
all
our
actions
bad
as
well
as
good
vicious
as
well
as
virtuous
thus
we
are
necessarily
reduced
to
the
other
side
of
the
dilemma
that
all
objects
which
are
found
to
be
constantly
conjoined
are
upon
that
account
only
to
be
regarded
as
causes
and
effects
now
as
all
objects
which
are
not
contrary
are
susceptible
of
a
constant
conjunction
and
as
no
real
objects
are
contrary
it
follows
that
for
ought
we
can
determine
by
the
mere
ideas
any
thing
may
be
the
cause
or
effect
of
any
thing
which
evidently
gives
the
advantage
to
the
materialists
above
their
antagonists
to
pronounce
then
the
final
decision
upon
the
whole
the
question
concerning
the
substance
of
the
soul
is
absolutely
unintelligible
all
our
perceptions
are
not
susceptible
of
a
local
union
either
with
what
is
extended
or
unextended
there
being
some
of
them
of
the
one
kind
and
some
of
the
other
and
as
the
constant
conjunction
of
objects
constitutes
the
very
essence
of
cause
and
effect
matter
and
motion
may
often
be
regarded
as
the
causes
of
thought
as
far
as
we
have
any
notion
of
that
relation
it
is
certainly
a
kind
of
indignity
to
philosophy
whose
sovereign
authority
ought
every
where
to
be
acknowledged
to
oblige
her
on
every
occasion
to
make
apologies
for
her
conclusions
and
justify
herself
to
every
particular
art
and
science
which
may
be
offended
at
her
this
puts
one
in
mind
of
a
king
arrainged
for
against
his
subjects
there
is
only
one
occasion
when
philosophy
will
think
it
necessary
and
even
honourable
to
justify
herself
and
that
is
when
religion
may
seem
to
be
in
the
least
offended
whose
rights
are
as
dear
to
her
as
her
own
and
are
indeed
the
same
if
any
one
therefore
should
imagine
that
the
foregoing
arguments
are
any
ways
dangerous
to
religion
i
hope
the
following
apology
will
remove
his
apprehensions
there
is
no
foundation
for
any
conclusion
a
priori
either
concerning
the
operations
or
duration
of
any
object
of
which
it
is
possible
for
the
human
mind
to
form
a
conception
any
object
may
be
imagined
to
become
entirely
inactive
or
to
be
annihilated
in
a
moment
and
it
is
an
evident
principle
that
whatever
we
can
imagine
is
possible
now
this
is
no
more
true
of
matter
than
of
spirit
of
an
extended
compounded
substance
than
of
a
simple
and
unextended
in
both
cases
the
metaphysical
arguments
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
are
equally
inconclusive
and
in
both
cases
the
moral
arguments
and
those
derived
from
the
analogy
of
nature
are
equally
strong
and
convincing
if
my
philosophy
therefore
makes
no
addition
to
the
arguments
for
religion
i
have
at
least
the
satisfaction
to
think
it
takes
nothing
from
them
but
that
every
thing
remains
precisely
as
before
sect
vi
of
personal
identity
there
are
some
philosophers
who
imagine
we
are
every
moment
intimately
conscious
of
what
we
call
our
self
that
we
feel
its
existence
and
its
continuance
in
existence
and
are
certain
beyond
the
evidence
of
a
demonstration
both
o
its
perfect
identity
and
simplicity
the
strongest
sensation
the
most
violent
passion
say
they
instead
of
distracting
us
from
this
view
only
fix
it
the
more
intensely
and
make
us
consider
their
influence
on
self
either
by
their
pain
or
pleasure
to
attempt
a
farther
proof
of
this
were
to
weaken
its
evidence
since
no
proof
can
be
derived
from
any
fact
of
which
we
are
so
intimately
conscious
nor
is
there
any
thing
of
which
we
can
be
certain
if
we
doubt
of
this
unluckily
all
these
positive
assertions
are
contrary
to
that
very
experience
which
is
pleaded
for
them
nor
have
we
any
idea
of
self
after
the
manner
it
is
here
explained
for
from
what
impression
coued
this
idea
be
derived
this
question
it
is
impossible
to
answer
without
a
manifest
contradiction
and
absurdity
and
yet
it
is
a
question
which
must
necessarily
be
answered
if
we
would
have
the
idea
of
self
pass
for
clear
and
intelligible
it
must
be
some
one
impression
that
gives
rise
to
every
real
idea
but
self
or
person
is
not
any
one
impression
but
that
to
which
our
several
impressions
and
ideas
are
supposed
to
have
a
reference
if
any
impression
gives
rise
to
the
idea
of
self
that
impression
must
continue
invariably
the
same
through
the
whole
course
of
our
lives
since
self
is
supposed
to
exist
after
that
manner
but
there
is
no
impression
constant
and
invariable
pain
and
pleasure
grief
and
joy
passions
and
sensations
succeed
each
other
and
never
all
exist
at
the
same
time
it
can
not
therefore
be
from
any
of
these
impressions
or
from
any
other
that
the
idea
of
self
is
derived
and
consequently
there
is
no
such
idea
but
farther
what
must
become
of
all
our
particular
perceptions
upon
this
hypothesis
all
these
are
different
and
distinguishable
and
separable
from
each
other
and
may
be
separately
considered
and
may
exist
separately
and
have
no
deed
of
tiny
thing
to
support
their
existence
after
what
manner
therefore
do
they
belong
to
self
and
how
are
they
connected
with
it
for
my
part
when
i
enter
most
intimately
into
what
i
call
myself
i
always
stumble
on
some
particular
perception
or
other
of
heat
or
cold
light
or
shade
love
or
hatred
pain
or
pleasure
i
never
can
catch
myself
at
any
time
without
a
perception
and
never
can
observe
any
thing
but
the
perception
when
my
perceptions
are
removed
for
any
time
as
by
sound
sleep
so
long
am
i
insensible
of
myself
and
may
truly
be
said
not
to
exist
and
were
all
my
perceptions
removed
by
death
and
coued
i
neither
think
nor
feel
nor
see
nor
love
nor
hate
after
the
dissolution
of
my
body
i
should
be
entirely
annihilated
nor
do
i
conceive
what
is
farther
requisite
to
make
me
a
perfect
if
any
one
upon
serious
and
unprejudiced
reflection
thinks
he
has
a
different
notion
of
himself
i
must
confess
i
call
reason
no
longer
with
him
all
i
can
allow
him
is
that
he
may
be
in
the
right
as
well
as
i
and
that
we
are
essentially
different
in
this
particular
he
may
perhaps
perceive
something
simple
and
continued
which
he
calls
himself
though
i
am
certain
there
is
no
such
principle
in
me
but
setting
aside
some
metaphysicians
of
this
kind
i
may
venture
to
affirm
of
the
rest
of
mankind
that
they
are
nothing
but
a
bundle
or
collection
of
different
perceptions
which
succeed
each
other
with
an
inconceivable
rapidity
and
are
in
a
perpetual
flux
and
movement
our
eyes
can
not
turn
in
their
sockets
without
varying
our
perceptions
our
thought
is
still
more
variable
than
our
sight
and
all
our
other
senses
and
faculties
contribute
to
this
change
nor
is
there
any
single
power
of
the
soul
which
remains
unalterably
the
same
perhaps
for
one
moment
the
mind
is
a
kind
of
theatre
where
several
perceptions
successively
make
their
appearance
pass
glide
away
and
mingle
in
an
infinite
variety
of
postures
and
situations
there
is
properly
no
simplicity
in
it
at
one
time
nor
identity
in
different
whatever
natural
propension
we
may
have
to
imagine
that
simplicity
and
identity
the
comparison
of
the
theatre
must
not
mislead
us
they
are
the
successive
perceptions
only
that
constitute
the
mind
nor
have
we
the
most
distant
notion
of
the
place
where
these
scenes
are
represented
or
of
the
materials
of
which
it
is
composed
what
then
gives
us
so
great
a
propension
to
ascribe
an
identity
to
these
successive
perceptions
and
to
suppose
ourselves
possest
of
an
invariable
and
uninterrupted
existence
through
the
whole
course
of
our
lives
in
order
to
answer
this
question
we
must
distinguish
betwixt
personal
identity
as
it
regards
our
thought
or
imagination
and
as
it
regards
our
passions
or
the
concern
we
take
in
ourselves
the
first
is
our
present
subject
and
to
explain
it
perfectly
we
must
take
the
matter
pretty
deep
and
account
for
that
identity
which
we
attribute
to
plants
and
animals
there
being
a
great
analogy
betwixt
it
and
the
identity
of
a
self
or
person
we
have
a
distinct
idea
of
an
object
that
remains
invariable
and
uninterrupted
through
a
supposed
variation
of
time
and
this
idea
we
call
that
of
identity
or
sameness
we
have
also
a
distinct
idea
of
several
different
objects
existing
in
succession
and
connected
together
by
a
close
relation
and
this
to
an
accurate
view
affords
as
perfect
a
notion
of
diversity
as
if
there
was
no
manner
of
relation
among
the
objects
but
though
these
two
ideas
of
identity
and
a
succession
of
related
objects
be
in
themselves
perfectly
distinct
and
even
contrary
yet
it
is
certain
that
in
our
common
way
of
thinking
they
are
generally
confounded
with
each
other
that
action
of
the
imagination
by
which
we
consider
the
uninterrupted
and
invariable
object
and
that
by
which
we
reflect
on
the
succession
of
related
objects
are
almost
the
same
to
the
feeling
nor
is
there
much
more
effort
of
thought
required
in
the
latter
case
than
in
the
former
the
relation
facilitates
the
transition
of
the
mind
from
one
object
to
another
and
renders
its
passage
as
smooth
as
if
it
contemplated
one
continued
object
this
resemblance
is
the
cause
of
the
confusion
and
mistake
and
makes
us
substitute
the
notion
of
identity
instead
of
that
of
related
objects
however
at
one
instant
we
may
consider
the
related
succession
as
variable
or
interrupted
we
are
sure
the
next
to
ascribe
to
it
a
perfect
identity
and
regard
it
as
enviable
and
uninterrupted
our
propensity
to
this
mistake
is
so
great
from
the
resemblance
that
we
fall
into
it
before
we
are
aware
and
though
we
incessantly
correct
ourselves
by
reflection
and
return
to
a
more
accurate
method
of
thinking
yet
we
can
not
long
sustain
our
philosophy
or
take
off
this
biass
from
the
imagination
our
last
resource
is
to
yield
to
it
and
boldly
assert
that
these
different
related
objects
are
in
effect
the
same
however
interrupted
and
variable
in
order
to
justify
to
ourselves
this
absurdity
we
often
feign
some
new
and
unintelligible
principle
that
connects
the
objects
together
and
prevents
their
interruption
or
variation
thus
we
feign
the
continued
existence
of
the
perceptions
of
our
senses
to
remove
the
interruption
and
run
into
the
notion
of
a
soul
and
self
and
substance
to
disguise
the
variation
but
we
may
farther
observe
that
where
we
do
not
give
rise
to
such
a
fiction
our
propension
to
confound
identity
with
relation
is
so
great
that
we
are
apt
to
imagine
footnote
something
unknown
and
mysterious
connecting
the
parts
beside
their
relation
and
this
i
take
to
be
the
case
with
regard
to
the
identity
we
ascribe
to
plants
and
vegetables
and
even
when
this
does
not
take
place
we
still
feel
a
propensity
to
confound
these
ideas
though
we
not
able
fully
to
satisfy
ourselves
in
that
particular
nor
find
any
thing
invariable
and
uninterrupted
to
justify
our
notion
of
identity
footnote
if
the
reader
is
desirous
to
see
how
a
great
genius
may
be
influencd
by
these
seemingly
trivial
principles
of
the
imagination
as
well
as
the
mere
vulgar
let
him
read
my
lord
shaftsburys
reasonings
concerning
the
uniting
principle
of
the
universe
and
the
identity
of
plants
and
animals
see
his
moralists
or
philosophical
rhapsody
thus
the
controversy
concerning
identity
is
not
merely
a
dispute
of
words
for
when
we
attribute
identity
in
an
improper
sense
to
variable
or
interrupted
objects
our
mistake
is
not
confined
to
the
expression
but
is
commonly
attended
with
a
fiction
either
of
something
invariable
and
uninterrupted
or
of
something
mysterious
and
inexplicable
or
at
least
with
a
propensity
to
such
fictions
what
will
suffice
to
prove
this
hypothesis
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
fair
enquirer
is
to
shew
from
daily
experience
and
observation
that
the
objects
which
are
variable
or
interrupted
and
yet
are
supposed
to
continue
the
same
are
such
only
as
consist
of
a
succession
of
parts
connected
together
by
resemblance
contiguity
or
causation
for
as
such
a
succession
answers
evidently
to
our
notion
of
diversity
it
can
only
be
by
mistake
we
ascribe
to
it
an
identity
and
as
the
relation
of
parts
which
leads
us
into
this
mistake
is
really
nothing
but
a
quality
which
produces
an
association
of
ideas
and
an
easy
transition
of
the
imagination
from
one
to
another
it
can
only
be
from
the
resemblance
which
this
act
of
the
mind
bears
to
that
by
which
we
contemplate
one
continued
object
that
the
error
arises
our
chief
business
then
must
be
to
prove
that
all
objects
to
which
we
ascribe
identity
without
observing
their
invariableness
and
uninterruptedness
are
such
as
consist
of
a
succession
of
related
objects
in
order
to
this
suppose
any
mass
of
matter
of
which
the
parts
are
contiguous
and
connected
to
be
placed
before
us
it
is
plain
we
must
attribute
a
perfect
identity
to
this
mass
provided
all
the
parts
continue
uninterruptedly
and
invariably
the
same
whatever
motion
or
change
of
place
we
may
observe
either
in
the
whole
or
in
any
of
the
parts
but
supposing
some
very
small
or
inconsiderable
part
to
be
added
to
the
mass
or
subtracted
from
it
though
this
absolutely
destroys
the
identity
of
the
whole
strictly
speaking
yet
as
we
seldom
think
so
accurately
we
scruple
not
to
pronounce
a
mass
of
matter
the
same
where
we
find
so
trivial
an
alteration
the
passage
of
the
thought
from
the
object
before
the
change
to
the
object
after
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
that
we
scarce
perceive
the
transition
and
are
apt
to
imagine
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
continued
survey
of
the
same
object
there
is
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
that
attends
this
experiment
which
is
that
though
the
change
of
any
considerable
part
in
a
mass
of
matter
destroys
the
identity
of
the
whole
let
we
must
measure
the
greatness
of
the
part
not
absolutely
but
by
its
proportion
to
the
whole
the
addition
or
diminution
of
a
mountain
would
not
be
sufficient
to
produce
a
diversity
in
a
planet
though
the
change
of
a
very
few
inches
would
be
able
to
destroy
the
identity
of
some
bodies
it
will
be
impossible
to
account
for
this
but
by
reflecting
that
objects
operate
upon
the
mind
and
break
or
interrupt
the
continuity
of
its
actions
not
according
to
their
real
greatness
but
according
to
their
proportion
to
each
other
and
therefore
since
this
interruption
makes
an
object
cease
to
appear
the
same
it
must
be
the
uninterrupted
progress
o
the
thought
which
constitutes
the
imperfect
identity
this
may
be
confirmed
by
another
phenomenon
a
change
in
any
considerable
part
of
a
body
destroys
its
identity
but
it
is
remarkable
that
where
the
change
is
produced
gradually
and
insensibly
we
are
less
apt
to
ascribe
to
it
the
same
effect
the
reason
can
plainly
be
no
other
than
that
the
mind
in
following
the
successive
changes
of
the
body
feels
an
easy
passage
from
the
surveying
its
condition
in
one
moment
to
the
viewing
of
it
in
another
and
at
no
particular
time
perceives
any
interruption
in
its
actions
from
which
continued
perception
it
ascribes
a
continued
existence
and
identity
to
the
object
but
whatever
precaution
we
may
use
in
introducing
the
changes
gradually
and
making
them
proportionable
to
the
whole
it
is
certain
that
where
the
changes
are
at
last
observed
to
become
considerable
we
make
a
scruple
of
ascribing
identity
to
such
different
objects
there
is
however
another
artifice
by
which
we
may
induce
the
imagination
to
advance
a
step
farther
and
that
is
by
producing
a
reference
of
the
parts
to
each
other
and
a
combination
to
some
common
end
or
purpose
a
ship
of
which
a
considerable
part
has
been
changed
by
frequent
reparations
is
still
considered
as
the
same
nor
does
the
difference
of
the
materials
hinder
us
from
ascribing
an
identity
to
it
the
common
end
in
which
the
parts
conspire
is
the
same
under
all
their
variations
and
affords
an
easy
transition
of
the
imagination
from
one
situation
of
the
body
to
another
but
this
is
still
more
remarkable
when
we
add
a
sympathy
of
parts
to
their
common
end
and
suppose
that
they
bear
to
each
other
the
reciprocal
relation
of
cause
and
effect
in
all
their
actions
and
operations
this
is
the
case
with
all
animals
and
vegetables
where
not
only
the
several
parts
have
a
reference
to
some
general
purpose
but
also
a
mutual
dependence
on
and
connexion
with
each
other
the
effect
of
so
strong
a
relation
is
that
though
every
one
must
allow
that
in
a
very
few
years
both
vegetables
and
animals
endure
a
total
change
yet
we
still
attribute
identity
to
them
while
their
form
size
and
substance
are
entirely
altered
an
oak
that
grows
from
a
small
plant
to
a
large
tree
is
still
the
same
oak
though
there
be
not
one
particle
of
matter
or
figure
of
its
parts
the
same
an
infant
becomes
a
and
is
sometimes
fat
sometimes
lean
without
any
change
in
his
identity
we
may
also
consider
the
two
following
phaenomena
which
are
remarkable
in
their
kind
the
first
is
that
though
we
commonly
be
able
to
distinguish
pretty
exactly
betwixt
numerical
and
specific
identity
yet
it
sometimes
happens
that
we
confound
them
and
in
our
thinking
and
reasoning
employ
the
one
for
the
other
thus
a
man
who
bears
a
noise
that
is
frequently
interrupted
and
renewed
says
it
is
still
the
same
noise
though
it
is
evident
the
sounds
have
only
a
specific
identity
or
resemblance
and
there
is
nothing
numerically
the
same
but
the
cause
which
produced
them
in
like
manner
it
may
be
said
without
breach
of
the
propriety
of
language
that
such
a
church
which
was
formerly
of
brick
fell
to
ruin
and
that
the
parish
rebuilt
the
same
church
of
and
according
to
modern
architecture
here
neither
the
form
nor
materials
are
the
same
nor
is
there
any
thing
common
to
the
two
objects
but
their
relation
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
parish
and
yet
this
alone
is
sufficient
to
make
us
denominate
them
the
same
but
we
must
observe
that
in
these
cases
the
first
object
is
in
a
manner
annihilated
before
the
second
comes
into
existence
by
which
means
we
are
never
presented
in
any
one
point
of
time
with
the
idea
of
difference
and
multiplicity
and
for
that
reason
are
less
scrupulous
in
calling
them
the
same
secondly
we
may
remark
that
though
in
a
succession
of
related
objects
it
be
in
a
manner
requisite
that
the
change
of
parts
be
not
sudden
nor
entire
in
order
to
preserve
the
identity
yet
where
the
objects
are
in
their
nature
changeable
and
inconstant
we
admit
of
a
more
sudden
transition
than
would
otherwise
be
consistent
with
that
relation
thus
as
the
nature
of
a
river
consists
in
the
motion
and
change
of
parts
though
in
less
than
four
and
twenty
hours
these
be
totally
altered
this
hinders
not
the
river
from
continuing
the
same
during
several
ages
what
is
natural
and
essential
to
any
thing
is
in
a
manner
expected
and
what
is
expected
makes
less
impression
and
appears
of
less
moment
than
what
is
unusual
and
extraordinary
a
considerable
change
of
the
former
kind
seems
really
less
to
the
imagination
than
the
most
trivial
alteration
of
the
latter
and
by
breaking
less
the
continuity
of
the
thought
has
less
influence
in
destroying
the
identity
we
now
proceed
to
explain
the
nature
of
personal
identity
which
has
become
so
great
a
question
ill
philosophy
especially
of
late
years
in
england
where
all
the
abstruser
sciences
are
studyed
with
a
peculiar
ardour
and
application
and
here
it
is
evident
the
same
method
of
reasoning
must
be
continued
which
has
so
successfully
explained
the
identity
of
plants
and
animals
and
ships
and
houses
and
of
all
the
compounded
and
changeable
productions
either
of
art
or
nature
the
identity
which
we
ascribe
to
the
mind
of
man
is
only
a
fictitious
one
and
of
a
like
kind
with
that
which
we
ascribe
to
vegetables
and
animal
bodies
it
can
not
therefore
have
a
different
origin
but
must
proceed
from
a
like
operation
of
the
imagination
upon
like
objects
but
lest
this
argument
should
not
convince
the
reader
though
in
my
opinion
perfectly
decisive
let
him
weigh
the
following
reasoning
which
is
still
closer
and
more
immediate
it
is
evident
that
the
identity
which
we
attribute
to
the
human
mind
however
perfect
we
may
imagine
it
to
be
is
not
able
to
run
the
several
different
perceptions
into
one
and
make
them
lose
their
characters
of
distinction
and
difference
which
are
essential
to
them
it
is
still
true
that
every
distinct
perception
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
mind
is
a
distinct
existence
and
is
different
and
distinguishable
and
separable
from
every
other
perception
either
contemporary
or
successive
but
as
notwithstanding
this
distinction
and
separability
we
suppose
the
whole
train
of
perceptions
to
be
united
by
identity
a
question
naturally
arises
concerning
this
relation
of
identity
whether
it
be
something
that
really
binds
our
several
perceptions
together
or
only
associates
their
ideas
in
the
imagination
that
is
in
other
words
whether
in
pronouncing
concerning
the
identity
of
a
person
we
observe
some
real
bond
among
his
perceptions
or
only
feel
one
among
the
ideas
we
form
of
them
this
question
we
might
easily
decide
if
we
would
recollect
what
has
been
already
proud
at
large
that
the
understanding
never
observes
any
real
connexion
among
objects
and
that
even
the
union
of
cause
and
effect
when
strictly
examined
resolves
itself
into
a
customary
association
of
ideas
for
from
thence
it
evidently
follows
that
identity
is
nothing
really
belonging
to
these
different
perceptions
and
uniting
them
together
but
is
merely
a
quality
which
we
attribute
to
them
because
of
the
union
of
their
ideas
in
the
imagination
when
we
reflect
upon
them
now
the
only
qualities
which
can
give
ideas
an
union
in
the
imagination
are
these
three
relations
there
are
the
uniting
principles
in
the
ideal
world
and
without
them
every
distinct
object
is
separable
by
the
mind
and
may
be
separately
considered
and
appears
not
to
have
any
more
connexion
with
any
other
object
than
if
disjoined
by
the
greatest
difference
and
remoteness
it
is
therefore
on
some
of
these
three
relations
of
resemblance
contiguity
and
causation
that
identity
depends
and
as
the
very
essence
of
these
relations
consists
in
their
producing
an
easy
transition
of
ideas
it
follows
that
our
notions
of
personal
identity
proceed
entirely
from
the
smooth
and
uninterrupted
progress
of
the
thought
along
a
train
of
connected
ideas
according
to
the
principles
the
only
question
therefore
which
remains
is
by
what
relations
this
uninterrupted
progress
of
our
thought
is
produced
when
we
consider
the
successive
existence
of
a
mind
or
thinking
person
and
here
it
is
evident
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
resemblance
and
causation
and
must
drop
contiguity
which
has
little
or
no
influence
in
the
present
case
to
begin
with
resemblance
suppose
we
coued
see
clearly
into
the
breast
of
another
and
observe
that
succession
of
perceptions
which
constitutes
his
mind
or
thinking
principle
and
suppose
that
he
always
preserves
the
memory
of
a
considerable
part
of
past
perceptions
it
is
evident
that
nothing
coued
more
contribute
to
the
bestowing
a
relation
on
this
succession
amidst
all
its
variations
for
what
is
the
memory
but
a
faculty
by
which
we
raise
up
the
images
of
past
perceptions
and
as
an
image
necessarily
resembles
its
object
must
not
the
frequent
placing
of
these
resembling
perceptions
in
the
chain
of
thought
convey
the
imagination
more
easily
from
one
link
to
another
and
make
the
whole
seem
like
the
continuance
of
one
object
in
this
particular
then
the
memory
not
only
discovers
the
identity
but
also
contributes
to
its
production
by
producing
the
relation
of
resemblance
among
the
perceptions
the
case
is
the
same
whether
we
consider
ourselves
or
others
as
to
causation
we
may
observe
that
the
true
idea
of
the
human
mind
is
to
consider
it
as
a
system
of
different
perceptions
or
different
existences
which
are
linked
together
by
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
and
mutually
produce
destroy
influence
and
modify
each
other
our
impressions
give
rise
to
their
correspondent
ideas
said
these
ideas
in
their
turn
produce
other
impressions
one
thought
chaces
another
and
draws
after
it
a
third
by
which
it
is
expelled
in
its
turn
in
this
respect
i
can
not
compare
the
soul
more
properly
to
any
thing
than
to
a
republic
or
commonwealth
in
which
the
several
members
are
united
by
the
reciprocal
ties
of
government
and
subordination
and
give
rise
to
other
persons
who
propagate
the
same
republic
in
the
incessant
changes
of
its
parts
and
as
the
same
individual
republic
may
not
only
change
its
members
but
also
its
laws
and
constitutions
in
like
manner
the
same
person
may
vary
his
character
and
disposition
as
well
as
his
impressions
and
ideas
without
losing
his
identity
whatever
changes
he
endures
his
several
parts
are
still
connected
by
the
relation
of
causation
and
in
this
view
our
identity
with
regard
to
the
passions
serves
to
corroborate
that
with
regard
to
the
imagination
by
the
making
our
distant
perceptions
influence
each
other
and
by
giving
us
a
present
concern
for
our
past
or
future
pains
or
pleasures
as
a
memory
alone
acquaints
us
with
the
continuance
and
extent
of
this
succession
of
perceptions
it
is
to
be
considered
upon
that
account
chiefly
as
the
source
of
personal
identity
had
we
no
memory
we
never
should
have
any
notion
of
causation
nor
consequently
of
that
chain
of
causes
and
effects
which
constitute
our
self
or
person
but
having
once
acquired
this
notion
of
causation
from
the
memory
we
can
extend
the
same
chain
of
causes
and
consequently
the
identity
of
car
persons
beyond
our
memory
and
can
comprehend
times
and
circumstances
and
actions
which
we
have
entirely
forgot
but
suppose
in
general
to
have
existed
for
how
few
of
our
past
actions
are
there
of
which
we
have
any
memory
who
can
tell
me
for
instance
what
were
his
thoughts
and
actions
on
the
of
january
the
of
march
and
the
of
august
or
will
he
affirm
because
he
has
entirely
forgot
the
incidents
of
these
days
that
the
present
self
is
not
the
same
person
with
the
self
of
that
time
and
by
that
means
overturn
all
the
most
established
notions
of
personal
identity
in
this
view
therefore
memory
does
not
so
much
produce
as
discover
personal
identity
by
shewing
us
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
among
our
different
perceptions
it
will
be
incumbent
on
those
who
affirm
that
memory
produces
entirely
our
personal
identity
to
give
a
reason
why
we
cm
thus
extend
our
identity
beyond
our
memory
the
whole
of
this
doctrine
leads
us
to
a
conclusion
which
is
of
great
importance
in
the
present
affair
viz
that
all
the
nice
and
subtile
questions
concerning
personal
identity
can
never
possibly
be
decided
and
are
to
be
regarded
rather
as
gramatical
than
as
philosophical
difficulties
identity
depends
on
the
relations
of
ideas
and
these
relations
produce
identity
by
means
of
that
easy
transition
they
occasion
but
as
the
relations
and
the
easiness
of
the
transition
may
diminish
by
insensible
degrees
we
have
no
just
standard
by
which
we
can
decide
any
dispute
concerning
the
time
when
they
acquire
or
lose
a
title
to
the
name
of
identity
all
the
disputes
concerning
the
identity
of
connected
objects
are
merely
verbal
except
so
fax
as
the
relation
of
parts
gives
rise
to
some
fiction
or
imaginary
principle
of
union
as
we
have
already
observed
what
i
have
said
concerning
the
first
origin
and
uncertainty
of
our
notion
of
identity
as
applied
to
the
human
mind
may
be
extended
with
little
or
no
variation
to
that
of
simplicity
an
object
whose
different
parts
are
bound
together
by
a
close
relation
operates
upon
the
imagination
after
much
the
same
manner
as
one
perfectly
simple
and
indivisible
and
requires
not
a
much
greater
stretch
of
thought
in
order
to
its
conception
from
this
similarity
of
operation
we
attribute
a
simplicity
to
it
and
feign
a
principle
of
union
as
the
support
of
this
simplicity
and
the
center
of
all
the
different
parts
and
qualities
of
the
object
thus
we
have
finished
our
examination
of
the
several
systems
of
philosophy
both
of
the
intellectual
and
natural
world
and
in
our
miscellaneous
way
of
reasoning
have
been
led
into
several
topics
which
will
either
illustrate
and
confirm
some
preceding
part
of
this
discourse
or
prepare
the
way
for
our
following
opinions
it
is
now
time
to
return
to
a
more
close
examination
of
our
subject
and
to
proceed
in
the
accurate
anatomy
of
human
nature
having
fully
explained
the
nature
of
our
judgment
and
understandings
sect
vii
conclusion
of
this
book
but
before
i
launch
out
into
those
immense
depths
of
philosophy
which
lie
before
me
i
find
myself
inclined
to
stop
a
moment
in
my
present
station
and
to
ponder
that
voyage
which
i
have
undertaken
and
which
undoubtedly
requires
the
utmost
art
and
industry
to
be
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
methinks
i
am
like
a
man
who
having
struck
on
many
shoals
and
having
narrowly
escaped
shipwreck
in
passing
a
small
frith
has
yet
the
temerity
to
put
out
to
sea
in
the
same
leaky
vessel
and
even
carries
his
ambition
so
far
as
to
think
of
compassing
the
globe
under
these
disadvantageous
circumstances
my
memory
of
past
errors
and
perplexities
makes
me
diffident
for
the
future
the
wretched
condition
weakness
and
disorder
of
the
faculties
i
must
employ
in
my
enquiries
encrease
my
apprehensions
and
the
impossibility
of
amending
or
correcting
these
faculties
reduces
me
almost
to
despair
and
makes
me
resolve
to
perish
on
the
barren
rock
on
which
i
am
at
present
rather
than
venture
myself
upon
that
boundless
ocean
which
runs
out
into
immensity
this
sudden
view
of
my
danger
strikes
me
with
melancholy
and
as
it
is
usual
for
that
passion
above
all
others
to
indulge
itself
i
can
not
forbear
feeding
my
despair
with
all
those
desponding
reflections
which
the
present
subject
furnishes
me
with
in
such
abundance
i
am
first
affrighted
and
confounded
with
that
forelorn
solitude
in
which
i
am
placed
in
my
philosophy
and
fancy
myself
some
strange
uncouth
monster
who
not
being
able
to
mingle
and
unite
in
society
has
been
expelled
all
human
commerce
and
left
utterly
abandoned
and
disconsolate
fain
would
i
run
into
the
crowd
for
shelter
and
warmth
but
can
not
prevail
with
myself
to
mix
with
such
deformity
i
call
upon
others
to
join
me
in
order
to
make
a
company
apart
but
no
one
will
hearken
to
me
every
one
keeps
at
a
distance
and
dreads
that
storm
which
beats
upon
me
from
every
side
i
have
exposed
myself
to
the
enmity
of
all
metaphysicians
logicians
mathematicians
and
even
theologians
and
can
i
wonder
at
the
insults
i
must
suffer
i
have
declared
my
disapprobation
of
their
systems
and
can
i
be
surprized
if
they
should
express
a
hatred
of
mine
and
of
my
person
when
i
look
abroad
i
foresee
on
every
side
dispute
contradiction
anger
calumny
and
detraction
when
i
turn
my
eye
inward
i
find
nothing
but
doubt
and
ignorance
all
the
world
conspires
to
oppose
and
contradict
me
though
such
is
my
weakness
that
i
feel
all
my
opinions
loosen
and
fall
of
themselves
when
unsupported
by
the
approbation
of
others
every
step
i
take
is
with
hesitation
and
every
new
reflection
makes
me
dread
an
error
and
absurdity
in
my
reasoning
for
with
what
confidence
can
i
venture
upon
such
bold
enterprises
when
beside
those
numberless
infirmities
peculiar
to
myself
i
find
so
many
which
are
common
to
human
nature
can
i
be
sure
that
in
leaving
all
established
opinions
i
am
following
truth
and
by
what
criterion
shall
i
distinguish
her
even
if
fortune
should
at
last
guide
me
on
her
after
the
most
accurate
and
exact
of
my
reasonings
i
can
give
no
reason
why
i
should
assent
to
it
and
feel
nothing
but
a
strong
propensity
to
consider
objects
strongly
in
that
view
under
which
they
appear
to
me
experience
is
a
principle
which
instructs
me
in
the
several
conjunctions
of
objects
for
the
past
habit
is
another
principle
which
determines
me
to
expect
the
same
for
the
future
and
both
of
them
conspiring
to
operate
upon
the
imagination
make
me
form
certain
ideas
in
a
more
intense
and
lively
manner
than
others
which
are
not
attended
with
the
same
advantages
without
this
quality
by
which
the
mind
enlivens
some
ideas
beyond
others
which
seemingly
is
so
trivial
and
so
little
founded
on
reason
we
coued
never
assent
to
any
argument
nor
carry
our
view
beyond
those
few
objects
which
are
present
to
our
senses
nay
even
to
these
objects
we
coued
never
attribute
any
existence
but
what
was
dependent
on
the
senses
and
must
comprehend
them
entirely
in
that
succession
of
perceptions
which
constitutes
our
self
or
person
nay
farther
even
with
relation
to
that
succession
we
coued
only
admit
of
those
perceptions
which
are
immediately
present
to
our
consciousness
nor
coued
those
lively
images
with
which
the
memory
presents
us
be
ever
received
as
true
pictures
of
past
perceptions
the
memory
senses
and
understanding
are
therefore
all
of
them
founded
on
the
imagination
or
the
vivacity
of
our
ideas
no
wonder
a
principle
so
inconstant
and
fallacious
should
lead
us
into
errors
when
implicitly
followed
as
it
must
be
in
all
its
variations
it
is
this
principle
which
makes
us
reason
from
causes
and
effects
and
it
is
the
same
principle
which
convinces
us
of
the
continued
existence
of
external
objects
when
absent
from
the
senses
but
though
these
two
operations
be
equally
natural
and
necessary
in
the
human
mind
yet
in
some
circumstances
they
are
sect
directly
contrary
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
to
reason
justly
and
regularly
from
causes
and
effects
and
at
the
same
time
believe
the
continued
existence
of
matter
how
then
shall
we
adjust
those
principles
together
which
of
them
shall
we
prefer
or
in
case
we
prefer
neither
of
them
but
successively
assent
to
both
as
is
usual
among
philosophers
with
what
confidence
can
we
afterwards
usurp
that
glorious
title
when
we
thus
knowingly
embrace
a
manifest
contradiction
this
contradiction
part
iii
sect
would
be
more
excusable
were
it
compensated
by
any
degree
of
solidity
and
satisfaction
in
the
other
parts
of
our
reasoning
but
the
case
is
quite
contrary
when
we
trace
up
the
human
understanding
to
its
first
principles
we
find
it
to
lead
us
into
such
sentiments
as
seem
to
turn
into
ridicule
all
our
past
pains
and
industry
and
to
discourage
us
from
future
enquiries
nothing
is
more
curiously
enquired
after
by
the
mind
of
man
than
the
causes
of
every
phenomenon
nor
are
we
content
with
knowing
the
immediate
causes
but
push
on
our
enquiries
till
we
arrive
at
the
original
and
ultimate
principle
we
would
not
willingly
stop
before
we
are
acquainted
with
that
energy
in
the
cause
by
which
it
operates
on
its
effect
that
tie
which
connects
them
together
and
that
efficacious
quality
on
which
the
tie
depends
this
is
our
aim
in
all
our
studies
and
reflections
and
how
must
we
be
disappointed
when
we
learn
that
this
connexion
tie
or
energy
lies
merely
in
ourselves
and
is
nothing
but
that
determination
of
the
mind
which
is
acquired
by
custom
and
causes
us
to
make
a
transition
from
an
object
to
its
usual
attendant
and
from
the
impression
of
one
to
the
lively
idea
of
the
other
such
a
discovery
not
only
cuts
off
all
hope
of
ever
attaining
satisfaction
but
even
prevents
our
very
wishes
since
it
appears
that
when
we
say
we
desire
to
know
the
ultimate
and
operating
principle
as
something
which
resides
in
the
external
object
we
either
contradict
ourselves
or
talk
without
a
meaning
this
deficiency
in
our
ideas
is
not
indeed
perceived
in
common
life
nor
are
we
sensible
that
in
the
most
usual
conjunctions
of
cause
and
effect
we
are
as
ignorant
of
the
ultimate
principle
which
binds
them
together
as
in
the
most
unusual
and
extraordinary
but
this
proceeds
merely
from
an
illusion
of
the
imagination
and
the
question
is
how
far
we
ought
to
yield
to
these
illusions
this
question
is
very
difficult
and
reduces
us
to
a
very
dangerous
dilemma
whichever
way
we
answer
it
for
if
we
assent
to
every
trivial
suggestion
of
the
fancy
beside
that
these
suggestions
are
often
contrary
to
each
other
they
lead
us
into
such
errors
absurdities
and
obscurities
that
we
must
at
last
become
ashamed
of
our
credulity
nothing
is
more
dangerous
to
reason
than
the
flights
of
the
imagination
and
nothing
has
been
the
occasion
of
more
mistakes
among
philosophers
men
of
bright
fancies
may
in
this
respect
be
compared
to
those
angels
whom
the
scripture
represents
as
covering
their
eyes
with
their
wings
this
has
already
appeared
in
so
many
instances
that
we
may
spare
ourselves
the
trouble
of
enlarging
upon
it
any
farther
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
consideration
of
these
instances
makes
us
take
a
resolution
to
reject
all
the
trivial
suggestions
of
the
fancy
and
adhere
to
the
understanding
that
is
to
the
general
and
more
established
properties
of
the
imagination
even
this
resolution
if
steadily
executed
would
be
dangerous
and
attended
with
the
most
fatal
consequences
for
i
have
already
shewn
sect
that
the
understanding
when
it
acts
alone
and
according
to
its
most
general
principles
entirely
subverts
itself
and
leaves
not
the
lowest
degree
of
evidence
in
any
proposition
either
in
philosophy
or
common
life
we
save
ourselves
from
this
total
scepticism
only
by
means
of
that
singular
and
seemingly
trivial
property
of
the
fancy
by
which
we
enter
with
difficulty
into
remote
views
of
things
and
are
not
able
to
accompany
them
with
so
sensible
an
impression
as
we
do
those
which
are
more
easy
and
natural
shall
we
then
establish
it
for
a
general
maxim
that
no
refined
or
elaborate
reasoning
is
ever
to
be
received
consider
well
the
consequences
of
such
a
principle
by
this
means
you
cut
off
entirely
all
science
and
philosophy
you
proceed
upon
one
singular
quality
of
the
imagination
and
by
a
parity
of
reason
must
embrace
all
of
them
and
you
expressly
contradict
yourself
since
this
maxim
must
be
built
on
the
preceding
reasoning
which
will
be
allowed
to
be
sufficiently
refined
and
metaphysical
what
party
then
shall
we
choose
among
these
difficulties
if
we
embrace
this
principle
and
condemn
all
refined
reasoning
we
run
into
the
most
manifest
absurdities
if
we
reject
it
in
favour
of
these
reasonings
we
subvert
entirely
the
human
understanding
we
have
therefore
no
choice
left
but
betwixt
a
false
reason
and
none
at
all
for
my
part
know
not
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
present
case
i
can
only
observe
what
is
commonly
done
which
is
that
this
difficulty
is
seldom
or
never
thought
of
and
even
where
it
has
once
been
present
to
the
mind
is
quickly
forgot
and
leaves
but
a
small
impression
behind
it
very
refined
reflections
have
little
or
no
influence
upon
us
and
yet
we
do
not
and
can
not
establish
it
for
a
rule
that
they
ought
not
to
have
any
influence
which
implies
a
manifest
contradiction
but
what
have
i
here
said
that
reflections
very
refined
and
metaphysical
have
little
or
no
influence
upon
us
this
opinion
i
can
scarce
forbear
retracting
and
condemning
from
my
present
feeling
and
experience
the
intense
view
of
these
manifold
contradictions
and
imperfections
in
human
reason
has
so
wrought
upon
me
and
heated
my
brain
that
i
am
ready
to
reject
all
belief
and
reasoning
and
can
look
upon
no
opinion
even
as
more
probable
or
likely
than
another
where
am
i
or
what
from
what
causes
do
i
derive
my
existence
and
to
what
condition
shall
i
return
whose
favour
shall
i
court
and
whose
anger
must
i
dread
what
beings
surround
me
and
on
whom
have
i
any
influence
or
who
have
any
influence
on
me
i
am
confounded
with
all
these
questions
and
begin
to
fancy
myself
in
the
most
deplorable
condition
imaginable
invironed
with
the
deepest
darkness
and
utterly
deprived
of
the
use
of
every
member
and
faculty
most
fortunately
it
happens
that
since
reason
is
incapable
of
dispelling
these
clouds
nature
herself
suffices
to
that
purpose
and
cures
me
of
this
philosophical
melancholy
and
delirium
either
by
relaxing
this
bent
of
mind
or
by
some
avocation
and
lively
impression
of
my
senses
which
obliterate
all
these
chimeras
i
dine
i
play
a
game
of
backgammon
i
converse
and
am
merry
with
my
friends
and
when
after
three
or
four
hours
amusement
i
would
return
to
these
speculations
they
appear
so
cold
and
strained
and
ridiculous
that
i
can
not
find
in
my
heart
to
enter
into
them
any
farther
here
then
i
find
myself
absolutely
and
necessarily
determined
to
live
and
talk
and
act
like
other
people
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
but
notwithstanding
that
my
natural
propensity
and
the
course
of
my
animal
spirits
and
passions
reduce
me
to
this
indolent
belief
in
the
general
maxims
of
the
world
i
still
feel
such
remains
of
my
former
disposition
that
i
am
ready
to
throw
all
my
books
and
papers
into
the
fire
and
resolve
never
more
to
renounce
the
pleasures
of
life
for
the
sake
of
reasoning
and
philosophy
for
those
are
my
sentiments
in
that
splenetic
humour
which
governs
me
at
present
i
may
nay
i
must
yield
to
the
current
of
nature
in
submitting
to
my
senses
and
understanding
and
in
this
blind
submission
i
shew
most
perfectly
my
sceptical
disposition
and
principles
but
does
it
follow
that
i
must
strive
against
the
current
of
nature
which
leads
me
to
indolence
and
pleasure
that
i
must
seclude
myself
in
some
measure
from
the
commerce
and
society
of
men
which
is
so
agreeable
and
that
i
must
torture
my
brains
with
subtilities
and
sophistries
at
the
very
time
that
i
can
not
satisfy
myself
concerning
the
reasonableness
of
so
painful
an
application
nor
have
any
tolerable
prospect
of
arriving
by
its
means
at
truth
and
certainty
under
what
obligation
do
i
lie
of
making
such
an
abuse
of
time
and
to
what
end
can
it
serve
either
for
the
service
of
mankind
or
for
my
own
private
interest
no
if
i
must
be
a
fool
as
all
those
who
reason
or
believe
any
thing
certainly
are
my
follies
shall
at
least
be
natural
and
agreeable
where
i
strive
against
my
inclination
i
shall
have
a
good
reason
for
my
resistance
and
will
no
more
be
led
a
wandering
into
such
dreary
solitudes
and
rough
passages
as
i
have
hitherto
met
with
these
are
the
sentiments
of
my
spleen
and
indolence
and
indeed
i
must
confess
that
philosophy
has
nothing
to
oppose
to
them
and
expects
a
victory
more
from
the
returns
of
a
serious
disposition
than
from
the
force
of
reason
and
conviction
in
all
the
incidents
of
life
we
ought
still
to
preserve
our
scepticism
if
we
believe
that
fire
warms
or
water
refreshes
it
is
only
because
it
costs
us
too
much
pains
to
think
otherwise
nay
if
we
are
philosophers
it
ought
only
to
be
upon
sceptical
principles
and
from
an
inclination
which
we
feel
to
the
employing
ourselves
after
that
manner
where
reason
is
lively
and
mixes
itself
with
some
propensity
it
ought
to
be
assented
to
where
it
does
not
it
never
can
have
any
title
to
operate
upon
us
at
the
time
therefore
that
i
am
tired
with
amusement
and
company
and
have
indulged
a
reverie
in
my
chamber
or
in
a
solitary
walk
by
a
i
feel
my
mind
all
collected
within
itself
and
am
naturally
inclined
to
carry
my
view
into
all
those
subjects
about
which
i
have
met
with
so
many
disputes
in
the
course
of
my
reading
and
conversation
i
can
not
forbear
having
a
curiosity
to
be
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
moral
good
and
evil
the
nature
and
foundation
of
government
and
the
cause
of
those
several
passions
and
inclinations
which
actuate
and
govern
me
i
am
uneasy
to
think
i
approve
of
one
object
and
disapprove
of
another
call
one
thing
beautiful
and
another
deformed
decide
concerning
truth
and
falshood
reason
and
folly
without
knowing
upon
what
principles
i
proceed
i
am
concerned
for
the
condition
of
the
learned
world
which
lies
under
such
t
deplorable
ignorance
in
all
these
particulars
i
feel
an
ambition
to
arise
in
me
of
contributing
to
the
instruction
of
mankind
and
of
acquiring
a
name
by
my
inventions
and
discoveries
these
sentiments
spring
up
naturally
in
my
present
disposition
and
should
i
endeavour
to
banish
them
by
attaching
myself
to
any
other
business
or
diversion
i
feel
i
should
be
a
loser
in
point
of
pleasure
and
this
is
the
origin
of
my
philosophy
but
even
suppose
this
curiosity
and
ambition
should
not
transport
me
into
speculations
without
the
sphere
of
common
life
it
would
necessarily
happen
that
from
my
very
weakness
i
must
be
led
into
such
enquiries
it
is
certain
that
superstition
is
much
more
bold
in
its
systems
and
hypotheses
than
philosophy
and
while
the
latter
contents
itself
with
assigning
new
causes
and
principles
to
the
phaenomena
which
appear
in
the
visible
world
the
former
opens
a
world
of
its
own
and
presents
us
with
scenes
and
beings
and
objects
which
are
altogether
new
since
therefore
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
mind
of
man
to
rest
like
those
of
beasts
in
that
narrow
circle
of
objects
which
are
the
subject
of
daily
conversation
and
action
we
ought
only
to
deliberate
concerning
the
choice
of
our
guide
and
ought
to
prefer
that
which
is
safest
and
most
agreeable
and
in
this
respect
i
make
bold
to
recommend
philosophy
and
shall
not
scruple
to
give
it
the
preference
to
superstition
of
every
kind
or
denomination
for
as
superstition
arises
naturally
and
easily
from
the
popular
opinions
of
mankind
it
seizes
more
strongly
on
the
mind
and
is
often
able
to
disturb
us
in
the
conduct
of
our
lives
and
actions
philosophy
on
the
contrary
if
just
can
present
us
only
with
mild
and
moderate
sentiments
and
if
false
and
extravagant
its
opinions
are
merely
the
objects
of
a
cold
and
general
speculation
and
seldom
go
so
far
as
to
interrupt
the
course
of
our
natural
propensities
the
cynics
are
an
extraordinary
instance
of
philosophers
who
from
reasonings
purely
philosophical
ran
into
as
great
extravagancies
of
conduct
as
any
monk
or
dervise
that
ever
was
in
the
world
generally
speaking
the
errors
in
religion
are
dangerous
those
in
philosophy
only
ridiculous
i
am
sensible
that
these
two
cases
of
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
mind
will
not
comprehend
all
mankind
and
that
there
are
in
england
in
particular
many
honest
gentlemen
who
being
always
employed
in
their
domestic
affairs
or
amusing
themselves
in
common
recreations
have
carried
their
thoughts
very
little
beyond
those
objects
which
are
every
day
exposed
to
their
senses
and
indeed
of
such
as
these
i
pretend
not
to
make
philosophers
nor
do
i
expect
them
either
to
be
associates
in
these
researches
or
auditors
of
these
discoveries
they
do
well
to
keep
themselves
in
their
present
situation
and
instead
of
refining
them
into
philosophers
i
wish
we
coued
communicate
to
our
founders
of
systems
a
share
of
this
gross
earthy
mixture
as
an
ingredient
which
they
commonly
stand
much
in
need
of
and
which
would
serve
to
temper
those
fiery
particles
of
which
they
are
composed
while
a
warm
imagination
is
allowed
to
enter
into
philosophy
and
hypotheses
embraced
merely
for
being
specious
and
agreeable
we
can
never
have
any
steady
principles
nor
any
sentiments
which
will
suit
with
common
practice
and
experience
but
were
these
hypotheses
once
removed
we
might
hope
to
establish
a
system
or
set
of
opinions
which
if
not
true
for
that
perhaps
is
too
much
to
be
hoped
for
might
at
least
be
satisfactory
to
the
human
mind
and
might
stand
the
test
of
the
most
critical
examination
nor
should
we
despair
of
attaining
this
end
because
of
the
many
chimerical
systems
which
have
successively
arisen
and
decayed
away
among
men
would
we
consider
the
shortness
of
that
period
wherein
these
questions
have
been
the
subjects
of
enquiry
and
reasoning
two
thousand
years
with
such
long
interruptions
and
under
such
mighty
discouragements
are
a
small
space
of
time
to
give
any
tolerable
perfection
to
the
sciences
and
perhaps
we
are
still
in
too
early
an
age
of
the
world
to
discover
any
principles
which
will
bear
the
examination
of
the
latest
posterity
for
my
part
my
only
hope
is
that
i
may
contribute
a
little
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
by
giving
in
some
particulars
a
different
turn
to
the
speculations
of
philosophers
and
pointing
out
to
them
more
distinctly
those
subjects
where
alone
they
can
expect
assurance
and
conviction
human
nature
is
the
only
science
of
man
and
yet
has
been
hitherto
the
most
neglected
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
if
i
can
bring
it
a
little
more
into
fashion
and
the
hope
of
this
serves
to
compose
my
temper
from
that
spleen
and
invigorate
it
from
that
indolence
which
sometimes
prevail
upon
me
if
the
reader
finds
himself
in
the
same
easy
disposition
let
him
follow
me
in
my
future
speculations
if
not
let
him
follow
his
inclination
and
wait
the
returns
of
application
and
good
humour
the
conduct
of
a
man
who
studies
philosophy
in
this
careless
manner
is
more
truly
sceptical
than
that
of
one
who
feeling
in
himself
an
inclination
to
it
is
yet
so
overwhelmed
with
doubts
and
scruples
as
totally
to
reject
it
a
true
sceptic
will
be
diffident
of
his
philosophical
doubts
as
well
as
of
his
philosophical
conviction
and
will
never
refuse
any
innocent
satisfaction
which
offers
itself
upon
account
of
either
of
them
nor
is
it
only
proper
we
should
in
general
indulge
our
inclination
in
the
most
elaborate
philosophical
researches
notwithstanding
our
sceptical
principles
but
also
that
we
should
yield
to
that
propensity
which
inclines
us
to
be
positive
and
certain
in
particular
points
according
to
the
light
in
which
we
survey
them
in
any
particular
instant
it
is
easier
to
forbear
all
examination
and
enquiry
than
to
check
ourselves
in
so
natural
a
propensity
and
guard
against
that
assurance
which
always
arises
from
an
exact
and
full
survey
of
an
object
on
such
an
occasion
we
are
apt
not
only
to
forget
our
scepticism
but
even
our
modesty
too
and
make
use
of
such
terms
as
these
it
is
evident
it
is
certain
it
is
undeniable
which
a
due
deference
to
the
public
ought
perhaps
to
prevent
i
may
have
fallen
into
this
fault
after
the
example
of
others
but
i
here
enter
a
caveat
against
any
objections
which
may
be
offered
on
that
head
and
declare
that
such
expressions
were
extorted
from
me
by
the
present
view
of
the
object
and
imply
no
dogmatical
spirit
nor
conceited
idea
of
my
own
judgment
which
are
sentiments
that
i
am
sensible
can
become
no
body
and
a
sceptic
still
less
than
any
other
book
ii
of
the

part
i
of
pride
and
humility
sect
i
division
of
the
subject
as
all
the
perceptions
of
the
mind
may
be
divided
into
impressions
and
ideas
so
the
impressions
admit
of
another
division
into
original
and
secondary
this
division
of
the
impressions
is
the
same
with
that
which
i
formerly
made
use
of
book
i
part
sect
when
i
distinguished
them
into
impressions
of
sensation
and
reflection
original
impressions
or
impressions
of
sensation
are
such
as
without
any
antecedent
perception
arise
in
the
soul
from
the
constitution
of
the
body
from
the
animal
spirits
or
from
the
application
of
objects
to
the
external
organs
secondary
or
reflective
impressions
are
such
as
proceed
from
some
of
these
original
ones
either
immediately
or
by
the
interposition
of
its
idea
of
the
first
kind
are
all
the
impressions
of
the
senses
and
all
bodily
pains
and
pleasures
of
the
second
are
the
passions
and
other
emotions
resembling
them
it
is
certain
that
the
mind
in
its
perceptions
must
begin
somewhere
and
that
since
the
impressions
precede
their
correspondent
ideas
there
must
be
some
impressions
which
without
any
introduction
make
their
appearance
in
the
soul
as
these
depend
upon
natural
and
physical
causes
the
examination
of
them
would
lead
me
too
far
from
my
present
subject
into
the
sciences
of
anatomy
and
natural
philosophy
for
this
reason
i
shall
here
confine
myself
to
those
other
impressions
which
i
have
called
secondary
and
reflective
as
arising
either
from
the
original
impressions
or
from
their
ideas
bodily
pains
and
pleasures
are
the
source
of
many
passions
both
when
felt
and
considered
by
the
mind
but
arise
originally
in
the
soul
or
in
the
body
whichever
you
please
to
call
it
without
any
preceding
thought
or
perception
a
fit
of
the
gout
produces
a
long
train
of
passions
as
grief
hope
fear
but
is
not
derived
immediately
from
any
affection
or
idea
the
reflective
impressions
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
viz
the
calm
and
the
violent
of
the
first
kind
is
the
sense
of
beauty
and
deformity
in
action
composition
and
external
objects
of
the
second
are
the
passions
of
love
and
hatred
grief
and
joy
pride
and
humility
this
division
is
far
from
being
exact
the
raptures
of
poetry
and
music
frequently
rise
to
the
greatest
height
while
those
other
impressions
properly
called
passions
may
decay
into
so
soft
an
emotion
as
to
become
in
a
manner
imperceptible
but
as
in
general
the
passions
are
more
violent
than
the
emotions
arising
from
beauty
and
deformity
these
impressions
have
been
commonly
distinguished
from
each
other
the
subject
of
the
human
mind
being
so
copious
and
various
i
shall
here
take
advantage
of
this
vulgar
and
spacious
division
that
i
may
proceed
with
the
greater
order
and
having
said
ali
i
thought
necessary
concerning
our
ideas
shall
now
explain
those
violent
emotions
or
passions
their
nature
origin
causes
and
effects
when
we
take
a
survey
of
the
passions
there
occurs
a
division
of
them
into
direct
and
indirect
by
direct
passions
i
understand
such
as
arise
immediately
from
good
or
evil
from
pain
or
pleasure
by
indirect
such
as
proceed
from
the
same
principles
but
by
the
conjunction
of
other
qualities
this
distinction
i
can
not
at
present
justify
or
explain
any
farther
i
can
only
observe
in
general
that
under
the
indirect
passions
i
comprehend
pride
humility
ambition
vanity
love
hatred
envy
pity
malice
generosity
with
their
dependants
and
under
the
direct
passions
desire
aversion
grief
joy
hope
fear
despair
and
security
i
shall
begin
with
the
former
sect
ii
of
pride
and
humility
their
objects
and
causes
the
passions
of
pride
and
humility
being
simple
and
uniform
impressions
it
is
impossible
we
can
ever
by
a
multitude
of
words
give
a
just
definition
of
them
or
indeed
of
any
of
the
passions
the
utmost
we
can
pretend
to
is
a
description
of
them
by
an
enumeration
of
such
circumstances
as
attend
them
but
as
these
words
pride
and
humility
are
of
general
use
and
the
impressions
they
represent
the
most
common
of
any
every
one
of
himself
will
be
able
to
form
a
just
idea
of
them
without
any
danger
of
mistake
for
which
reason
not
to
lose
time
upon
preliminaries
i
shall
immediately
enter
upon
the
examination
of
these
passions
it
is
evident
that
pride
and
humility
though
directly
contrary
have
yet
the
same
object
this
object
is
self
or
that
succession
of
related
ideas
and
impressions
of
which
we
have
an
intimate
memory
and
consciousness
here
the
view
always
fixes
when
we
are
actuated
by
either
of
these
passions
according
as
our
idea
of
ourself
is
more
or
less
advantageous
we
feel
either
of
those
opposite
affections
and
are
elated
by
pride
or
dejected
with
humility
whatever
other
objects
may
be
comprehended
by
the
mind
they
are
always
considered
with
a
view
to
ourselves
otherwise
they
would
never
be
able
either
to
excite
these
passions
or
produce
the
smallest
encrease
or
diminution
of
them
when
self
enters
not
into
the
consideration
there
is
no
room
either
for
pride
or
humility
but
though
that
connected
succession
of
perceptions
which
we
call
self
be
always
the
object
of
these
two
passions
it
is
impossible
it
can
be
their
cause
or
be
sufficient
alone
to
excite
them
for
as
these
passions
are
directly
contrary
and
have
the
same
object
in
common
were
their
object
also
their
cause
it
coued
never
produce
any
degree
of
the
one
passion
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
excite
an
equal
degree
of
the
other
which
opposition
and
contrariety
must
destroy
both
it
is
impossible
a
man
can
at
the
same
time
be
both
proud
and
humble
and
where
he
has
different
reasons
for
these
passions
as
frequently
happens
the
passions
either
take
place
alternately
or
if
they
encounter
the
one
annihilates
the
other
as
far
as
its
strength
goes
and
the
remainder
only
of
that
which
is
superior
continues
to
operate
upon
the
mind
but
in
the
present
case
neither
of
the
passions
coued
ever
become
superior
because
supposing
it
to
be
the
view
only
of
ourself
which
excited
them
that
being
perfectly
indifferent
to
either
must
produce
both
in
the
very
same
proportion
or
in
other
words
can
produce
neither
to
excite
any
passion
and
at
the
same
time
raise
an
equal
share
of
its
antagonist
is
immediately
to
undo
what
was
done
and
must
leave
the
mind
at
last
perfectly
calm
and
indifferent
we
must
therefore
make
a
distinction
betwixt
the
cause
and
the
object
of
these
passions
betwixt
that
idea
which
excites
them
and
that
to
which
they
direct
their
view
when
excited
pride
and
humility
being
once
raised
immediately
turn
our
attention
to
ourself
and
regard
that
as
their
ultimate
and
final
object
but
there
is
something
farther
requisite
in
order
to
raise
them
something
which
is
peculiar
to
one
of
the
passions
and
produces
not
both
in
the
very
same
degree
the
first
idea
that
is
presented
to
the
mind
is
that
of
the
cause
or
productive
principle
this
excites
the
passion
connected
with
it
and
that
passion
when
excited
turns
our
view
to
another
idea
which
is
that
of
self
here
then
is
a
passion
placed
betwixt
two
ideas
of
which
the
one
produces
it
and
the
other
is
produced
by
it
the
first
idea
therefore
represents
the
cause
the
second
the
object
of
the
passion
to
begin
with
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
we
may
observe
that
their
most
obvious
and
remarkable
property
is
the
vast
variety
of
subjects
on
which
they
may
be
placed
every
valuable
quality
of
the
mind
whether
of
the
imagination
judgment
memory
or
disposition
wit
learning
courage
justice
integrity
all
these
are
the
cause
of
pride
and
their
opposites
of
humility
nor
are
these
passions
confined
to
the
mind
but
extend
their
view
to
the
body
likewise
a
man
may
be
proud
of
his
beauty
strength
agility
good
mein
address
in
dancing
riding
and
of
his
dexterity
in
any
manual
business
or
manufacture
but
this
is
not
all
the
passions
looking
farther
comprehend
whatever
objects
are
in
the
least
allyed
or
related
to
us
our
country
family
children
relations
riches
houses
gardens
horses
dogs
cloaths
any
of
these
may
become
a
cause
either
of
pride
or
of
humility
from
the
consideration
of
these
causes
it
appears
necessary
we
shoud
make
a
new
distinction
in
the
causes
of
the
passion
betwixt
that
quality
which
operates
and
the
subject
on
which
it
is
placed
a
man
for
instance
is
vain
of
a
beautiful
house
which
belongs
to
him
or
which
he
has
himself
built
and
contrived
here
the
object
of
the
passion
is
himself
and
the
cause
is
the
beautiful
house
which
cause
again
is
into
two
parts
viz
the
quality
which
operates
upon
the
passion
and
the
subject
in
which
the
quality
inheres
the
quality
is
the
beauty
and
the
subject
is
the
house
considered
as
his
property
or
contrivance
both
these
parts
are
essential
nor
is
the
distinction
vain
and
chimerical
beauty
considered
merely
as
such
unless
placed
upon
something
related
to
us
never
produces
any
pride
or
vanity
and
the
strongest
relation
alone
without
beauty
or
something
else
in
its
place
has
as
little
influence
on
that
passion
since
therefore
these
two
particulars
are
easily
separated
and
there
is
a
necessity
for
their
conjunction
in
order
to
produce
the
passion
we
ought
to
consider
them
as
component
parts
of
the
cause
and
infix
in
our
minds
an
exact
idea
of
this
distinction
sect
iii
whence
these
objects
and
causes
are
derived
being
so
far
advanced
as
to
observe
a
difference
betwixt
the
object
of
the
passions
and
their
cause
and
to
distinguish
in
the
cause
the
quality
which
operates
on
the
passions
from
the
subject
in
which
it
inheres
we
now
proceed
to
examine
what
determines
each
of
them
to
be
what
it
is
and
assigns
such
a
particular
object
and
quality
and
subject
to
these
affections
by
this
means
we
shall
fully
understand
the
origin
of
pride
and
humility
it
is
evident
in
the
first
place
that
these
passions
are
derermined
to
have
self
for
their
object
not
only
by
a
natural
but
also
by
an
original
property
no
one
can
doubt
but
this
property
is
natural
from
the
constancy
and
steadiness
of
its
operations
it
is
always
self
which
is
the
object
of
pride
and
humility
and
whenever
the
passions
look
beyond
it
is
still
with
a
view
to
ourselves
nor
can
any
person
or
object
otherwise
have
any
influence
upon
us
that
this
proceeds
from
an
original
quality
or
primary
impulse
will
likewise
appear
evident
if
we
consider
that
it
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
these
passions
unless
nature
had
given
some
original
qualities
to
the
mind
it
coued
never
have
any
secondary
ones
because
in
that
case
it
would
have
no
foundation
for
action
nor
coued
ever
begin
to
exert
itself
now
these
qualities
which
we
must
consider
as
original
are
such
as
are
most
inseparable
from
the
soul
and
can
be
resolved
into
no
other
and
such
is
the
quality
which
determines
the
object
of
pride
and
humility
we
may
perhaps
make
it
a
greater
question
whether
the
causes
that
produce
the
passion
be
as
natural
as
the
object
to
which
it
is
directed
and
whether
all
that
vast
variety
proceeds
from
caprice
or
from
the
constitution
of
the
mind
this
doubt
we
shall
soon
remove
if
we
cast
our
eye
upon
human
nature
and
consider
that
in
all
nations
and
ages
the
same
objects
still
give
rise
to
pride
and
humility
and
that
upon
the
view
even
of
a
stranger
we
can
know
pretty
nearly
what
will
either
encrease
or
diminish
his
passions
of
this
kind
if
there
be
any
variation
in
this
particular
it
proceeds
from
nothing
but
a
difference
in
the
tempers
and
complexions
of
men
and
is
besides
very
inconsiderable
can
we
imagine
it
possible
that
while
human
nature
remains
the
same
men
will
ever
become
entirely
indifferent
to
their
power
riches
beauty
or
personal
merit
and
that
their
pride
and
vanity
will
not
be
affected
by
these
advantages
but
though
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
be
plainly
natural
we
shall
find
upon
examination
that
they
are
not
original
and
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
they
should
each
of
them
be
adapted
to
these
passions
by
a
particular
provision
and
primary
constitution
of
nature
beside
their
prodigious
number
many
of
them
are
the
effects
of
art
and
arise
partly
from
the
industry
partly
from
the
caprice
and
partly
from
the
good
fortune
of
men
industry
produces
houses
furniture
cloaths
caprice
determines
their
particular
kinds
and
qualities
and
good
fortune
frequently
contributes
to
all
this
by
discovering
the
effects
that
result
from
the
different
mixtures
and
combinations
of
bodies
it
is
absurd
therefore
to
imagine
that
each
of
these
was
foreseen
and
provided
for
by
nature
and
that
every
new
production
of
art
which
causes
pride
or
humility
instead
of
adapting
itself
to
the
passion
by
partaking
of
some
general
quality
that
naturally
operates
on
the
mind
is
itself
the
object
of
an
original
principle
which
till
then
lay
concealed
in
the
soul
and
is
only
by
accident
at
last
brought
to
light
thus
the
first
mechanic
that
invented
a
fine
scritoire
produced
pride
in
him
who
became
possest
of
it
by
principles
different
from
those
which
made
him
proud
of
handsome
chairs
and
tables
as
this
appears
evidently
ridiculous
we
must
conclude
that
each
cause
of
pride
and
humility
is
not
adapted
to
the
passions
by
a
distinct
original
quality
but
that
there
are
some
one
or
more
circumstances
common
to
all
of
them
on
which
their
efficacy
depends
besides
we
find
in
the
course
of
nature
that
though
the
effects
be
many
the
principles
from
which
they
arise
are
commonly
but
few
and
simple
and
that
it
is
the
sign
of
an
unskilful
naturalist
to
have
recourse
to
a
different
quality
in
order
to
explain
every
different
operation
how
much
more
must
this
be
true
with
regard
to
the
human
mind
which
being
so
confined
a
subject
may
justly
be
thought
incapable
of
containing
such
a
monstrous
heap
of
principles
as
would
be
necessary
to
excite
the
passions
of
pride
and
humility
were
each
distinct
cause
adapted
to
the
passion
by
a
distinct
set
of
principles
here
therefore
moral
philosophy
is
in
the
same
condition
as
natural
with
regard
to
astronomy
before
the
time
of
copernicus
the
antients
though
sensible
of
that
maxim
that
nature
does
nothing
in
vain
contrived
such
intricate
systems
of
the
heavens
as
seemed
inconsistent
with
true
philosophy
and
gave
place
at
last
to
something
more
simple
and
natural
to
invent
without
scruple
a
new
principle
to
every
new
phaenomenon
instead
of
adapting
it
to
the
old
to
overload
our
hypotheses
with
a
variety
of
this
kind
are
certain
proofs
that
none
of
these
principles
is
the
just
one
and
that
we
only
desire
by
a
number
of
falsehoods
to
cover
our
ignorance
of
the
truth
sect
iv
of
the
relations
of
impressions
and
ideas
thus
we
have
established
two
truths
without
any
obstacle
or
difficulty
that
it
is
from
natural
principles
this
variety
of
causes
excites
pride
and
humility
and
that
it
is
not
by
a
different
principle
each
different
cause
is
adapted
to
its
passion
we
shall
now
proceed
to
enquire
how
we
may
reduce
these
principles
to
a
lesser
number
and
find
among
the
causes
something
common
on
which
their
influence
depends
in
order
to
this
we
must
reflect
on
certain
properties
of
human
nature
which
though
they
have
a
mighty
influence
on
every
operation
both
of
the
understanding
and
passions
are
not
commonly
much
insisted
on
by
philosophers
the
first
of
these
is
the
association
of
ideas
which
i
have
so
often
observed
and
explained
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
to
fix
itself
steadily
upon
one
idea
for
any
considerable
time
nor
can
it
by
its
utmost
efforts
ever
arrive
at
such
a
constancy
but
however
changeable
our
thoughts
may
be
they
are
not
entirely
without
rule
and
method
in
their
changes
the
rule
by
which
they
proceed
is
to
pass
from
one
object
to
what
is
resembling
contiguous
to
or
produced
by
it
when
one
idea
is
present
to
the
imagination
any
other
united
by
these
relations
naturally
follows
it
and
enters
with
more
facility
by
means
of
that
introduction
the
second
property
i
shall
observe
in
the
human
mind
is
a
like
association
of
impressions
all
resembling
impressions
are
connected
together
and
no
sooner
one
arises
than
the
rest
immediately
follow
grief
and
disappointment
give
rise
to
anger
anger
to
envy
envy
to
malice
and
malice
to
grief
again
till
the
whole
circle
be
compleated
in
like
manner
our
temper
when
elevated
with
joy
naturally
throws
itself
into
love
generosity
pity
courage
pride
and
the
other
resembling
affections
it
is
difficult
for
the
mind
when
actuated
by
any
passion
to
confine
itself
to
that
passion
alone
without
any
change
or
variation
human
nature
is
too
inconstant
to
admit
of
any
such
regularity
changeableness
is
essential
to
it
and
to
what
can
it
so
naturally
change
as
to
affections
or
emotions
which
are
suitable
to
the
temper
and
agree
with
that
set
of
passions
which
then
prevail
it
is
evident
then
there
is
an
attraction
or
association
among
impressions
as
well
as
among
ideas
though
with
this
remarkable
difference
that
ideas
are
associated
by
resemblance
contiguity
and
causation
and
impressions
only
by
resemblance
in
the
third
place
it
is
observable
of
these
two
kinds
of
association
that
they
very
much
assist
and
forward
each
other
and
that
the
transition
is
more
easily
made
where
they
both
concur
in
the
same
object
thus
a
man
who
by
any
injury
from
another
is
very
much
discomposed
and
ruffled
in
his
temper
is
apt
to
find
a
hundred
subjects
of
discontent
impatience
fear
and
other
uneasy
passions
especially
if
he
can
discover
these
subjects
in
or
near
the
person
who
was
the
cause
of
his
first
passion
those
principles
which
forward
the
transition
of
ideas
here
concur
with
those
which
operate
on
the
passions
and
both
uniting
in
one
action
bestow
on
the
mind
a
double
impulse
the
new
passion
therefore
must
arise
with
so
much
greater
violence
and
the
transition
to
it
must
be
rendered
so
much
more
easy
and
natural
upon
this
occasion
i
may
cite
the
authority
of
an
elegant
writer
who
expresses
himself
in
the
following
manner
as
the
fancy
delights
in
every
thing
that
is
great
strange
or
beautiful
and
is
still
more
pleased
the
more
it
finds
of
these
perfections
in
the
same
object
so
it
is
capable
of
receiving
a
new
satisfaction
by
the
assistance
of
another
sense
thus
any
continued
sound
as
the
music
of
birds
or
a
fall
of
waters
awakens
every
moment
the
mind
of
the
beholder
and
makes
him
more
attentive
to
the
several
beauties
of
the
place
that
lie
before
him
thus
if
there
arises
a
fragrancy
of
smells
or
perfumes
they
heighten
the
pleasure
of
the
imagination
and
make
even
the
colours
and
verdure
of
the
landschape
appear
more
agreeable
for
the
ideas
of
both
senses
recommend
each
other
and
are
pleasanter
together
than
when
they
enter
the
mind
separately
as
the
different
colours
of
a
picture
when
they
are
well
disposed
set
off
one
another
and
receive
an
additional
beauty
from
the
advantage
of
the
situation
addison
spectator
final
paragraph
in
this
phaenomenon
we
may
remark
the
association
both
of
impressions
and
ideas
as
well
as
the
mutual
assistance
they
lend
each
other
sect
v
of
the
influence
of
these
relations
on
pride
and
humility
these
principles
being
established
on
unquestionable
experience
i
begin
to
consider
how
we
shall
apply
them
by
revolving
over
all
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
whether
these
causes
be
regarded
as
the
qualities
that
operate
or
as
the
subjects
on
which
the
qualities
are
placed
in
examining
these
qualities
i
immediately
find
many
of
them
to
concur
in
producing
the
sensation
of
pain
and
pleasure
independent
of
those
affections
which
i
here
endeavour
to
explain
thus
the
beauty
of
our
person
of
itself
and
by
its
very
appearance
gives
pleasure
as
well
as
pride
and
its
deformity
pain
as
well
as
humility
a
magnificent
feast
delights
us
and
a
sordid
one
displeases
what
i
discover
to
be
true
in
some
instances
i
suppose
to
be
so
in
all
and
take
it
for
granted
at
present
without
any
farther
proof
that
every
cause
of
pride
by
its
peculiar
qualities
produces
a
separate
pleasure
and
of
humility
a
separate
uneasiness
again
in
considering
the
subjects
to
which
these
qualities
adhere
i
make
a
new
supposition
which
also
appears
probable
from
many
obvious
instances
viz
that
these
subjects
are
either
parts
of
ourselves
or
something
nearly
related
to
us
thus
the
good
and
bad
qualities
of
our
actions
and
manners
constitute
virtue
and
vice
and
determine
our
personal
character
than
which
nothing
operates
more
strongly
on
these
passions
in
like
manner
it
is
the
beauty
or
deformity
of
our
person
houses
equipage
or
furniture
by
which
we
are
rendered
either
vain
or
humble
the
same
qualities
when
transfered
to
subjects
which
bear
us
no
relation
influence
not
in
the
smallest
degree
either
of
these
affections
having
thus
in
a
manner
supposed
two
properties
of
the
causes
of
these
affections
viz
that
the
qualities
produce
a
separate
pain
or
pleasure
and
that
the
subjects
on
which
the
qualities
are
placed
are
related
to
self
i
proceed
to
examine
the
passions
themselves
in
order
to
find
something
in
them
correspondent
to
the
supposed
properties
of
their
causes
first
i
find
that
the
peculiar
object
of
pride
and
humility
is
determined
by
an
original
and
natural
instinct
and
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
from
the
primary
constitution
of
the
mind
that
these
passions
should
ever
look
beyond
self
or
that
individual
person
of
whose
actions
and
sentiments
each
of
us
is
intimately
conscious
here
at
last
the
view
always
rests
when
we
are
actuated
by
either
of
these
passions
nor
can
we
in
that
situation
of
mind
ever
lose
sight
of
this
object
for
this
i
pretend
not
to
give
any
reason
but
consider
such
a
peculiar
direction
of
the
thought
as
an
original
quality
the
second
quality
which
i
discover
in
these
passions
and
which
i
likewise
consider
an
an
original
quality
is
their
sensations
or
the
peculiar
emotions
they
excite
in
the
soul
and
which
constitute
their
very
being
and
essence
thus
pride
is
a
pleasant
sensation
and
humility
a
painful
and
upon
the
removal
of
the
pleasure
and
pain
there
is
in
reality
no
pride
nor
humility
of
this
our
very
feeling
convinces
us
and
beyond
our
feeling
it
is
here
in
vain
to
reason
or
dispute
if
i
compare
therefore
these
two
established
properties
of
the
passions
viz
their
object
which
is
self
and
their
sensation
which
is
either
pleasant
or
painful
to
the
two
supposed
properties
of
the
causes
viz
their
relation
to
self
and
their
tendency
to
produce
a
pain
or
pleasure
independent
of
the
passion
i
immediately
find
that
taking
these
suppositions
to
be
just
the
true
system
breaks
in
upon
me
with
an
irresistible
evidence
that
cause
which
excites
the
passion
is
related
to
the
object
which
nature
has
attributed
to
the
passion
the
sensation
which
the
cause
separately
produces
is
related
to
the
sensation
of
the
passion
from
this
double
relation
of
ideas
and
impressions
the
passion
is
derived
the
one
idea
is
easily
converted
into
its
correlative
and
the
one
impression
into
that
which
resembles
and
corresponds
to
it
with
how
much
greater
facility
must
this
transition
be
made
where
these
movements
mutually
assist
each
other
and
the
mind
receives
a
double
impulse
from
the
relations
both
of
its
impressions
and
ideas
that
we
may
comprehend
this
the
better
we
must
suppose
that
nature
has
given
to
the
organs
of
the
human
mind
a
certain
disposition
fitted
to
produce
a
peculiar
impression
or
emotion
which
we
call
pride
to
this
emotion
she
has
assigned
a
certain
idea
viz
that
of
self
which
it
never
fails
to
produce
this
contrivance
of
nature
is
easily
conceived
we
have
many
instances
of
such
a
situation
of
affairs
the
nerves
of
the
nose
and
palate
are
so
disposed
as
in
certain
circumstances
to
convey
such
peculiar
sensations
to
the
mind
the
sensations
of
lust
and
hunger
always
produce
in
us
the
idea
of
those
peculiar
objects
which
are
suitable
to
each
appetite
these
two
circumstances
are
united
in
pride
the
organs
are
so
disposed
as
to
produce
the
passion
and
the
passion
after
its
production
naturally
produces
a
certain
idea
all
this
needs
no
proof
it
is
evident
we
never
should
be
possest
of
that
passion
were
there
not
a
disposition
of
mind
proper
for
it
and
it
is
as
evident
that
the
passion
always
turns
our
view
to
ourselves
and
makes
us
think
of
our
own
qualities
and
circumstances
this
being
fully
comprehended
it
may
now
be
asked
whether
nature
produces
the
passion
immediately
of
herself
or
whether
she
must
be
assisted
by
the
of
other
causes
for
it
is
observable
that
in
this
particular
her
conduct
is
different
in
the
different
passions
and
sensations
the
palate
must
be
excited
by
an
external
object
in
order
to
produce
any
relish
but
hunger
arises
internally
without
the
concurrence
of
any
external
object
but
however
the
case
may
stand
with
other
passions
and
impressions
it
is
certain
that
pride
requires
the
assistance
of
some
foreign
object
and
that
the
organs
which
produce
it
exert
not
themselves
like
the
heart
and
arteries
by
an
original
internal
movement
for
first
daily
experience
convinces
us
that
pride
requires
certain
causes
to
excite
it
and
languishes
when
unsupported
by
some
excellency
in
the
character
in
bodily
accomplishments
in
cloaths
equipage
or
fortune
secondly
it
is
evident
pride
would
be
perpetual
if
it
arose
immediately
from
nature
since
the
object
is
always
the
same
and
there
is
no
disposition
of
body
peculiar
to
pride
as
there
is
to
thirst
and
hunger
thirdly
humility
is
in
the
very
same
situation
with
pride
and
therefore
either
must
upon
this
supposition
be
perpetual
likewise
or
must
destroy
the
contrary
passion
from
the
very
first
moment
so
that
none
of
them
coued
ever
make
its
appearance
upon
the
whole
we
may
rest
satisfyed
with
the
foregoing
conclusion
that
pride
must
have
a
cause
as
well
as
an
object
and
that
the
one
has
no
influence
without
the
other
the
difficulty
then
is
only
to
discover
this
cause
and
find
what
it
is
that
gives
the
first
motion
to
pride
and
sets
those
organs
in
action
which
are
naturally
fitted
to
produce
that
emotion
upon
my
consulting
experience
in
order
to
resolve
this
difficulty
i
immediately
find
a
hundred
different
causes
that
produce
pride
and
upon
examining
these
causes
i
suppose
what
at
first
i
perceive
to
be
probable
that
all
of
them
concur
in
two
circumstances
which
are
that
of
themselves
they
produce
an
impression
allyed
to
the
passion
and
are
placed
on
a
subject
allyed
to
the
object
of
the
passion
when
i
consider
after
this
the
nature
of
relation
and
its
effects
both
on
the
passions
and
ideas
i
can
no
longer
doubt
upon
these
suppositions
that
it
is
the
very
principle
which
gives
rise
to
pride
and
bestows
motion
on
those
organs
which
being
naturally
disposed
to
produce
that
affection
require
only
a
first
impulse
or
beginning
to
their
action
any
thing
that
gives
a
pleasant
sensation
and
is
related
to
self
excites
the
passion
of
pride
which
is
also
agreeable
and
has
self
for
its
object
what
i
have
said
of
pride
is
equally
true
of
humility
the
sensation
of
humility
is
uneasy
as
that
of
pride
is
agreeable
for
which
reason
the
separate
sensation
arising
from
the
causes
must
be
reversed
while
the
relation
to
self
continues
the
same
though
pride
and
humility
are
directly
contrary
in
their
effects
and
in
their
sensations
they
have
notwithstanding
the
same
object
so
that
it
is
requisite
only
to
change
the
relation
of
impressions
without
making
any
change
upon
that
of
ideas
accordingly
we
find
that
a
beautiful
house
belonging
to
ourselves
produces
pride
and
that
the
same
house
still
belonging
to
ourselves
produces
humility
when
by
any
accident
its
beauty
is
changed
into
deformity
and
thereby
the
sensation
of
pleasure
which
corresponded
to
pride
is
transformed
into
pain
which
is
related
to
humility
the
double
relation
between
the
ideas
and
impressions
subsists
in
both
cases
and
produces
an
easy
transition
from
the
one
emotion
to
the
other
in
a
word
nature
has
bestowed
a
kind
of
attraction
on
certain
impressions
and
ideas
by
which
one
of
them
upon
its
appearance
naturally
introduces
its
correlative
if
these
two
attractions
or
associations
of
impressions
and
ideas
concur
on
the
same
object
they
mutually
assist
each
other
and
the
transition
of
the
affections
and
of
the
imagination
is
made
with
the
greatest
ease
and
facility
when
an
idea
produces
an
impression
related
to
an
impression
which
is
connected
with
an
idea
related
to
the
first
idea
these
two
impressions
must
be
in
a
manner
inseparable
nor
will
the
one
in
any
case
be
unattended
with
the
other
it
is
after
this
manner
that
the
particular
causes
of
pride
and
humility
are
determined
the
quality
which
operates
on
the
passion
produces
separately
an
impression
resembling
it
the
subject
to
which
the
quality
adheres
is
related
to
self
the
object
of
the
passion
no
wonder
the
whole
cause
consisting
of
a
quality
and
of
a
subject
does
so
unavoidably
give
rise
to
the
pass
on
to
illustrate
this
hypothesis
we
may
compare
it
to
that
by
which
i
have
already
explained
the
belief
attending
the
judgments
which
we
form
from
causation
i
have
observed
that
in
all
judgments
of
this
kind
there
is
always
a
present
impression
and
a
related
idea
and
that
the
present
impression
gives
a
vivacity
to
the
fancy
and
the
relation
conveys
this
vivacity
by
an
easy
transition
to
the
related
idea
without
the
present
impression
the
attention
is
not
fixed
nor
the
spirits
excited
without
the
relation
this
attention
rests
on
its
first
object
and
has
no
farther
consequence
there
is
evidently
a
great
analogy
betwixt
that
hypothesis
and
our
present
one
of
an
impression
and
idea
that
transfuse
themselves
into
another
impression
and
idea
by
means
of
their
double
relation
which
analogy
must
be
allowed
to
be
no
despicable
proof
of
both
hypotheses
sect
vi
limitations
of
this
system
but
before
we
proceed
farther
in
this
subject
and
examine
particularly
all
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
it
will
be
proper
to
make
some
limitations
to
the
general
system
that
all
agreeable
objects
related
to
ourselves
by
an
association
of
ideas
and
of
impressions
produce
pride
and
disagreeable
ones
humility
and
these
limitations
are
derived
from
the
very
nature
of
the
subject
i
suppose
an
agreeable
object
to
acquire
a
relation
to
self
the
first
passion
that
appears
on
this
occasion
is
joy
and
this
passion
discovers
itself
upon
a
slighter
relation
than
pride
and
we
may
feel
joy
upon
being
present
at
a
feast
where
our
senses
are
regard
with
delicacies
of
every
kind
but
it
is
only
the
master
of
the
feast
who
beside
the
same
joy
has
the
additional
passion
of
and
vanity
it
is
true
men
sometimes
boast
of
a
great
entertainment
at
which
they
have
only
been
present
and
by
so
small
a
relation
convert
their
pleasure
into
pride
but
however
this
must
in
general
be
owned
that
joy
arises
from
a
more
inconsiderable
relation
than
vanity
and
that
many
things
which
are
too
foreign
to
produce
pride
are
yet
able
to
give
us
a
delight
and
pleasure
the
reason
of
the
difference
may
be
explained
thus
a
relation
is
requisite
to
joy
in
order
to
approach
the
object
to
us
and
make
it
give
us
any
satisfaction
but
beside
this
which
is
common
to
both
passions
it
is
requisite
to
pride
in
order
to
produce
a
transition
from
one
passion
to
another
and
convert
the
falsification
into
vanity
as
it
has
a
double
task
to
perform
it
must
be
endowed
with
double
force
and
energy
to
which
we
may
add
that
where
agreeable
objects
bear
not
a
very
close
relation
to
ourselves
they
commonly
do
to
some
other
person
and
this
latter
relation
not
only
excels
but
even
diminishes
and
sometimes
destroys
the
former
as
we
shall
see
afterwards
part
ii
sec
here
then
is
the
first
limitation
we
must
make
to
our
general
position
that
every
thing
related
to
us
which
produces
pleasure
or
pain
produces
likewise
pride
or
humility
there
is
not
only
a
relation
required
but
a
close
one
and
a
closer
than
is
required
to
joy
ii
the
second
limitation
is
that
the
agreeable
or
disagreeable
object
be
not
only
closely
related
but
also
peculiar
to
ourselves
or
at
least
common
to
us
with
a
few
persons
it
is
a
quality
observable
in
human
nature
and
which
we
shall
endeavour
to
explain
afterwards
that
every
thing
which
is
often
presented
and
to
which
we
have
been
long
accustomed
loses
its
value
in
our
eyes
and
is
in
a
little
time
despised
and
neglected
we
likewise
judge
of
objects
more
from
comparison
than
from
their
real
and
intrinsic
merit
and
where
we
can
not
by
some
contrast
enhance
their
value
we
are
apt
to
overlook
even
what
is
essentially
good
in
them
these
qualities
of
the
mind
have
an
effect
upon
joy
as
well
as
pride
and
it
is
remarkable
that
goods
which
are
common
to
all
mankind
and
have
become
familiar
to
us
by
custom
give
us
little
satisfaction
though
perhaps
of
a
more
excellent
kind
than
those
on
which
for
their
singularity
we
set
a
much
higher
value
but
though
this
circumstance
operates
on
both
these
passions
it
has
a
much
greater
influence
on
vanity
we
are
rejoiced
for
many
goods
which
on
account
of
their
frequency
give
us
no
pride
health
when
it
returns
after
a
long
absence
affords
us
a
very
sensible
satisfaction
but
is
seldom
regarded
as
a
subject
of
vanity
because
it
is
shared
with
such
vast
numbers
the
reason
why
pride
is
so
much
more
delicate
in
this
particular
than
joy
i
take
to
be
as
follows
in
order
to
excite
pride
there
are
always
two
objects
we
must
contemplate
viz
the
cause
or
that
object
which
produces
pleasure
and
self
which
is
the
real
object
of
the
passion
but
joy
has
only
one
object
necessary
to
its
production
viz
that
which
gives
pleasure
and
though
it
be
requisite
that
this
bear
some
relation
to
self
yet
that
is
only
requisite
in
order
to
render
it
agreeable
nor
is
self
properly
speaking
the
object
of
this
passion
since
therefore
pride
has
in
a
manner
two
objects
to
which
it
directs
our
view
it
follows
that
where
neither
of
them
have
any
singularity
the
passion
must
be
more
weakened
upon
that
account
than
a
passion
which
has
only
one
object
upon
comparing
ourselves
with
others
as
we
are
every
moment
apt
to
do
we
find
we
are
not
in
the
least
distinguished
and
upon
comparing
the
object
we
possess
we
discover
still
the
same
unlucky
circumstance
by
two
comparisons
so
disadvantageous
the
passion
must
be
entirely
destroyed
iii
the
third
limitation
is
that
the
pleasant
or
painful
object
be
very
discernible
and
obvious
and
that
not
only
to
ourselves
but
to
others
also
this
circumstance
like
the
two
foregoing
has
an
effect
upon
joy
as
well
as
pride
we
fancy
ourselves
more
happy
as
well
as
more
virtuous
or
beautiful
when
we
appear
so
to
others
but
are
still
more
ostentatious
of
our
virtues
than
of
our
pleasures
this
proceeds
from
causes
which
i
shall
endeavour
to
explain
afterwards
iv
the
fourth
limitation
is
derived
from
the
inconstancy
of
the
cause
of
these
passions
and
from
the
short
duration
of
its
connexion
with
ourselves
what
is
casual
and
inconstant
gives
but
little
joy
and
less
pride
we
are
not
much
satisfyed
with
the
thing
itself
and
are
still
less
apt
to
feel
any
new
degrees
of
upon
its
account
we
foresee
and
anticipate
its
change
by
the
imagination
which
makes
us
little
satisfyed
with
the
thing
we
compare
it
to
ourselves
whose
existence
is
more
durable
by
which
means
its
inconstancy
appears
still
greater
it
seems
ridiculous
to
infer
an
excellency
in
ourselves
from
an
object
which
is
of
so
much
shorter
duration
and
attends
us
during
so
small
a
part
of
our
existence
it
will
be
easy
to
comprehend
the
reason
why
this
cause
operates
not
with
the
same
force
in
joy
as
in
pride
since
the
idea
of
self
is
not
so
essential
to
the
former
passion
as
to
the
latter
i
may
add
as
a
fifth
limitation
or
rather
enlargement
of
this
system
that
general
rules
have
a
great
influence
upon
pride
and
humility
as
well
as
on
all
the
other
passions
hence
we
form
a
notion
of
different
ranks
of
men
suitable
to
the
power
of
riches
they
are
possest
of
and
this
notion
we
change
not
upon
account
of
any
peculiarities
of
the
health
or
temper
of
the
persons
which
may
deprive
them
of
all
enjoyment
in
their
possessions
this
may
be
accounted
for
from
the
same
principles
that
explained
the
influence
of
general
rules
on
the
understanding
custom
readily
carries
us
beyond
the
just
bounds
in
our
passions
as
well
as
in
our
reasonings
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
on
this
occasion
that
the
influence
of
general
rules
and
maxims
on
the
passions
very
much
contributes
to
facilitate
the
effects
of
all
the
principles
which
we
shall
explain
in
the
progress
of
this
treatise
for
it
is
evident
that
if
a
person
and
of
the
same
nature
with
ourselves
were
on
a
into
our
world
he
would
be
very
much
embarrased
with
every
object
and
would
not
readily
find
what
degree
of
love
or
hatred
pride
or
humility
or
any
other
passion
he
ought
to
attribute
to
it
the
passions
are
often
varyed
by
very
inconsiderable
principles
and
these
do
not
always
play
with
a
perfect
regularity
especially
on
the
first
trial
but
as
custom
and
practice
have
brought
to
light
all
these
principles
and
have
settled
the
just
value
of
every
thing
this
must
certainly
contribute
to
the
easy
production
of
the
passions
and
guide
us
by
means
of
general
established
maxims
in
the
proportions
we
ought
to
observe
in
preferring
one
object
to
another
this
remark
may
perhaps
serve
to
obviate
difficulties
that
mayarise
concerning
some
causes
which
i
shall
hereafter
ascribe
to
particular
passions
and
which
may
be
esteemed
too
refined
to
operate
so
universally
and
certainly
as
they
are
found
to
do
i
shall
close
this
subject
with
a
reflection
derived
from
these
five
limitations
this
reflection
is
that
the
persons
who
are
proudest
and
who
in
the
eye
of
the
world
have
most
reason
for
their
pride
are
not
always
the
happiest
nor
the
most
humble
always
the
most
miserable
as
may
at
first
sight
be
imagined
from
this
system
an
evil
may
be
real
though
its
cause
has
no
relation
to
us
it
may
be
real
without
being
peculiar
it
may
be
real
without
shewing
itself
to
others
it
may
be
real
without
being
constant
and
it
may
be
real
without
falling
under
the
general
rules
such
evils
as
these
will
not
fail
to
render
us
miserable
though
they
have
little
tendency
to
diminish
pride
and
perhaps
the
most
real
and
the
most
solid
evils
of
life
will
be
found
of
this
nature
sect
vii
of
vice
and
virtue
taking
these
limitations
along
with
us
let
us
proceed
to
examine
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
and
see
whether
in
every
case
we
can
discover
the
double
relations
by
which
they
operate
on
the
passions
if
we
find
that
all
these
causes
are
related
to
self
and
produce
a
pleasure
or
uneasiness
separate
from
the
passion
there
will
remain
no
farther
scruple
with
regard
to
the
present
system
we
shall
principally
endeavour
to
prove
the
latter
point
the
former
being
in
a
manner
to
begin
with
vice
and
virtue
which
are
the
most
obvious
causes
of
these
passions
it
would
be
entirely
foreign
to
my
present
purpose
to
enter
upon
the
controversy
which
of
late
years
has
so
much
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
publick
whether
these
moral
distinctions
be
founded
on
natural
and
original
principles
or
arise
from
interest
and
education
the
examination
of
this
i
reserve
for
the
following
book
and
in
the
mean
time
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
that
my
system
maintains
its
ground
upon
either
of
these
hypotheses
which
will
be
a
strong
proof
of
its
solidity
for
granting
that
morality
had
no
foundation
in
nature
it
must
still
be
allowed
that
vice
and
virtue
either
from
or
the
prejudices
of
education
produce
in
us
a
real
pain
and
pleasure
and
this
we
may
observe
to
be
strenuously
asserted
by
the
defenders
of
that
hypothesis
every
passion
habit
or
turn
of
character
say
they
which
has
a
tendency
to
our
advantage
or
prejudice
gives
a
delight
or
uneasiness
and
it
is
from
thence
the
approbation
or
disapprobation
arises
we
easily
gain
from
the
liberality
of
others
but
are
always
in
danger
of
losing
by
their
avarice
courage
defends
us
but
cowardice
lays
us
open
to
every
attack
justice
is
the
support
of
society
but
injustice
unless
checked
would
quickly
prove
its
ruin
humility
exalts
but
pride
mortifies
us
for
these
reasons
the
former
qualities
are
esteemed
virtues
and
the
latter
regarded
as
vices
now
since
it
is
granted
there
is
a
delight
or
uneasiness
still
attending
merit
or
demerit
of
every
kind
this
is
all
that
is
requisite
for
my
purpose
but
i
go
farther
and
observe
that
this
moral
hypothesis
and
my
present
system
not
only
agree
together
but
also
that
allowing
the
former
to
be
just
it
is
an
absolute
and
invincible
proof
of
the
latter
for
if
all
morality
be
founded
on
the
pain
or
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
prospect
of
any
loss
or
advantage
that
may
result
from
our
own
characters
or
from
those
of
others
all
the
effects
of
morality
derived
from
the
same
pain
or
pleasure
and
among
the
rest
the
passions
of
pride
and
humility
the
very
essence
of
virtue
according
to
this
hypothesis
is
to
produce
pleasure
and
that
of
vice
to
give
pain
the
virtue
and
vice
must
be
part
of
our
character
in
order
to
excite
pride
or
humility
what
farther
proof
can
we
desire
for
the
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
the
same
unquestionable
argument
may
be
derived
from
the
opinion
of
those
who
maintain
that
morality
is
something
real
essential
and
founded
on
nature
the
most
probable
hypothesis
which
has
been
advanced
to
explain
the
distinction
betwixt
vice
and
virtue
and
the
origin
of
moral
rights
and
obligations
is
that
from
a
primary
constitution
of
nature
certain
characters
and
passions
by
the
very
view
and
contemplation
produce
a
pain
and
others
in
like
manner
excite
a
pleasure
the
uneasiness
and
satisfaction
are
not
only
inseparable
from
vice
and
virtue
but
constitute
their
very
nature
and
essence
to
approve
of
a
character
is
to
feel
an
original
delight
upon
its
appearance
to
disapprove
of
it
is
to
be
sensible
of
an
uneasiness
the
pain
and
pleasure
therefore
being
the
primary
causes
of
vice
and
virtue
must
also
be
the
causes
of
all
their
effects
and
consequently
of
pride
and
humility
which
are
the
unavoidable
attendants
of
that
distinction
but
supposing
this
hypothesis
of
moral
philosophy
should
be
allowed
to
be
false
it
is
still
evident
that
pain
and
pleasure
if
not
the
causes
of
vice
and
virtue
are
at
least
inseparable
from
them
a
generous
and
noble
character
affords
a
satisfaction
even
in
the
survey
and
when
presented
to
us
though
only
in
a
poem
or
fable
never
fails
to
charm
and
delight
us
on
the
other
hand
cruelty
and
treachery
displease
from
their
very
nature
nor
is
it
possible
ever
to
reconcile
us
to
these
qualities
either
in
ourselves
or
others
thus
one
hypothesis
of
morality
is
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
foregoing
system
and
the
other
at
worst
agrees
with
it
but
pride
and
humility
arise
not
from
these
qualities
alone
of
the
mind
which
according
to
the
vulgar
systems
of
ethicks
have
been
comprehended
as
parts
of
moral
duty
but
from
any
other
that
has
a
connexion
with
pleasure
and
uneasiness
nothing
flatters
our
vanity
more
than
the
talent
of
pleasing
by
our
wit
good
humour
or
any
other
accomplishment
and
nothing
gives
us
a
more
sensible
mortification
than
a
disappointment
in
any
attempt
of
that
nature
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
tell
what
wit
is
and
why
such
a
system
of
thought
must
be
received
under
that
denomination
and
such
another
rejected
it
is
only
by
taste
we
can
decide
concerning
it
nor
are
we
possest
of
any
other
standard
upon
which
we
can
form
a
judgment
of
this
kind
now
what
is
this
taste
from
which
true
and
false
wit
in
a
manner
receive
their
being
and
without
which
no
thought
can
have
a
title
to
either
of
these
denominations
it
is
plainly
nothing
but
a
sensation
of
pleasure
from
true
wit
and
of
uneasiness
from
false
without
oar
being
able
to
tell
the
reasons
of
that
pleasure
or
uneasiness
the
power
of
bestowing
these
opposite
sensations
is
therefore
the
very
essence
of
true
and
false
wit
and
consequently
the
cause
of
that
pride
or
humility
which
arises
from
them
there
may
perhaps
be
some
who
being
accustomed
to
the
style
of
the
schools
and
pulpit
and
having
never
considered
human
nature
in
any
other
light
than
that
in
which
they
place
it
may
here
be
surprized
to
hear
me
talk
of
virtue
as
exciting
pride
which
they
look
upon
as
a
vice
and
of
vice
as
producing
humility
which
they
have
been
taught
to
consider
as
a
virtue
but
not
to
dispute
about
words
i
observe
that
by
pride
i
understand
that
agreeable
impression
which
arises
in
the
mind
when
the
view
either
of
our
virtue
beauty
riches
or
power
makes
us
satisfyed
with
ourselves
and
that
by
humility
i
mean
the
opposite
impression
it
is
evident
the
former
impression
is
not
always
vicious
nor
the
latter
virtuous
the
most
rigid
morality
allows
us
to
receive
a
pleasure
from
reflecting
on
a
generous
action
and
it
is
by
none
esteemed
a
virtue
to
feel
any
fruitless
remorses
upon
the
thoughts
of
past
villainy
and
baseness
let
us
therefore
examine
these
impressions
considered
in
themselves
and
enquire
into
their
causes

on
the
mind
or
body

present

blame

these
double
relations
which
i
have
asserted
to
be
necessary
to
the
causes
of
pride
and
humility
wherever
therefore
we
can
find
the
other
relation
of
impressions
to
join
to
this
of
ideas
we
may
expect
with
assurance
either
of
these
passions
according
as
the
impression
is
pleasant
or
uneasy
but
beauty
of
all
kinds
gives
us
a
peculiar
delight
and
satisfaction
as
deformity
produces
pain
upon
whatever
subject
it
may
be
placed
and
whether
surveyed
in
an
animate
or
inanimate
object
if
the
beauty
or
deformity
therefore
be
placed
upon
our
own
bodies
this
pleasure
or
uneasiness
must
be
converted
into
pride
or
humility
as
having
in
this
case
all
the
circumstances
requisite
to
produce
a
perfect
transition
of
impressions
and
ideas
these
opposite
sensations
are
related
to
the
opposite
passions
the
beauty
or
deformity
is
closely
related
to
self
the
object
of
both
these
passions
no
wonder
then
our
own
beauty
becomes
an
object
of
pride
and
deformity
of
humility
but
this
effect
of
personal
and
bodily
qualities
is
not
only
a
proof
of
the
present
system
by
shewing
that
the
passions
arise
not
in
this
case
without
all
the
circumstances
i
have
required
but
may
be
employed
as
a
stronger
and
more
convincing
argument
if
we
consider
all
the
hypotheses
which
have
been
formed
either
by
philosophy
or
common
reason
to
explain
the
difference
betwixt
beauty
and
deformity
we
shall
find
that
all
of
them
resolve
into
this
that
beauty
is
such
an
order
and
construction
of
parts
as
either
by
the
primary
constitution
of
our
nature
by
custom
or
by
caprice
is
fitted
to
give
a
pleasure
and
satisfaction
to
the
soul
this
is
the
distinguishing
character
of
beauty
and
forms
all
the
difference
betwixt
it
and
deformity
whose
natural
tendency
is
to
produce
uneasiness
pleasure
and
pain
therefore
are
not
only
necessary
attendants
of
beauty
and
deformity
but
constitute
their
very
essence
and
indeed
if
we
consider
that
a
great
part
of
the
beauty
which
we
admire
either
in
animals
or
in
other
objects
is
derived
from
the
idea
of
convenience
and
utility
we
shall
make
no
scruple
to
assent
to
this
opinion
that
shape
which
produces
strength
is
beautiful
in
one
animal
and
that
which
is
a
sign
of
agility
in
another
the
order
and
convenience
of
a
palace
are
no
less
essential
to
its
beauty
than
its
mere
figure
and
appearance
in
like
manner
the
rules
of
architecture
require
that
the
top
of
a
pillar
should
be
more
slender
than
its
base
and
that
because
such
a
figure
conveys
to
us
the
idea
of
security
which
is
pleasant
whereas
the
contrary
form
gives
us
the
apprehension
of
danger
which
is
uneasy
from
innumerable
instances
of
this
kind
as
well
as
from
considering
that
beauty
like
wit
can
not
be
defined
but
is
discerned
only
by
a
taste
or
sensation
we
may
conclude
that
beauty
is
nothing
but
a
form
which
produces
pleasure
as
deformity
is
a
structure
of
parts
which
conveys
pain
and
since
the
power
of
producing
pain
and
pleasure
make
in
this
manner
the
essence
of
beauty
and
deformity
all
the
effects
of
these
qualities
must
be
derived
from
the
sensation
and
among
the
rest
pride
and
humility
which
of
all
their
effects
are
the
most
common
and
remarkable
this
argument
i
esteem
just
and
decisive
but
in
order
to
give
greater
authority
to
the
present
reasoning
let
us
suppose
it
false
for
a
moment
and
see
what
will
follow
it
is
certain
then
that
if
the
power
of
producing
pleasure
and
pain
forms
not
the
essence
of
beauty
and
deformity
the
sensations
are
at
least
inseparable
from
the
qualities
and
it
is
even
difficult
to
consider
them
apart
now
there
is
nothing
common
to
natural
and
moral
beauty
both
of
which
are
the
causes
of
pride
but
this
power
of
producing
pleasure
and
as
a
common
effect
supposes
always
a
common
cause
it
is
plain
the
pleasure
must
in
both
cases
be
the
real
and
influencing
cause
of
the
passion
again
there
is
nothing
originally
different
betwixt
the
beauty
of
our
bodies
and
the
beauty
of
external
and
foreign
objects
but
that
the
one
has
a
near
relation
to
ourselves
which
is
wanting
in
the
other
this
original
difference
therefore
must
be
the
cause
of
all
their
other
differences
and
among
the
rest
of
their
different
influence
upon
the
passion
of
pride
which
is
excited
by
the
beauty
of
our
person
but
is
not
affected
in
the
lcast
by
that
of
foreign
and
external
objects
placing
then
these
two
conclusions
together
we
find
they
compose
the
preceding
system
betwixt
them
viz
that
pleasure
as
a
related
or
resembling
impression
when
placed
on
a
related
object
by
a
natural
transition
produces
pride
and
its
contrary
humility
this
system
then
seems
already
sufficiently
confirmed
by
experience
that
we
have
not
yet
exhausted
all
our
arguments
it
is
not
the
beauty
of
the
body
alone
that
produces
pride
but
also
its
strength
and
force
strength
is
a
kind
of
power
and
therefore
the
desire
to
excel
in
strength
is
to
be
considered
as
an
inferior
species
of
ambition
for
this
reason
the
present
phaenomenon
will
be
sufficiently
accounted
for
in
explaining
that
passion
concerning
all
other
bodily
accomplishments
we
may
observe
in
general
that
whatever
in
ourselves
is
either
useful
beautiful
or
surprising
is
an
object
of
pride
and
it
contrary
of
humility
now
it
is
obvious
that
every
thing
useful
beautiful
or
surprising
agrees
in
producing
a
separate
pleasure
and
agrees
in
nothing
else
the
pleasure
therefore
with
the
relation
to
self
must
be
the
cause
of
the
passion
though
it
should
be
questioned
whether
beauty
be
not
something
real
and
different
from
the
power
of
producing
pleasure
it
can
never
be
disputed
that
as
surprize
is
nothing
but
a
pleasure
arising
from
novelty
it
is
not
properly
speaking
a
quality
in
any
object
but
merely
a
passion
or
impression
in
the
soul
it
must
therefore
be
from
that
impression
that
pride
by
a
natural
transition
arises
and
it
arises
so
naturally
that
there
is
nothing
in
us
or
belonging
to
us
which
produces
surprize
that
does
not
at
the
same
time
excite
that
other
passion
thus
we
are
vain
of
the
surprising
adventures
we
have
met
with
the
escapes
we
have
made
and
dangers
we
have
been
exposed
to
hence
the
origin
of
vulgar
lying
where
men
without
any
interest
and
merely
out
of
vanity
heap
up
a
number
of
extraordinary
events
which
are
either
the
fictions
of
their
brain
or
if
true
have
at
least
no
connexion
with
themselves
their
fruitful
invention
supplies
them
with
a
variety
of
adventures
and
where
that
talent
is
wanting
they
appropriate
such
as
belong
to
others
in
order
to
satisfy
their
vanity
in
this
phaenomenon
are
contained
two
curious
experiments
which
if
we
compare
them
together
according
to
the
known
rules
by
which
we
judge
of
cause
and
effect
in
anatomy
natural
philosophy
and
other
sciences
will
be
an
undeniable
argument
for
that
influence
of
the
double
relations
by
one
of
these
experiments
we
find
that
an
object
produces
pride
merely
by
the
interposition
of
pleasure
and
that
because
the
quality
by
which
it
produces
pride
is
in
reality
nothing
but
the
power
of
producing
pleasure
by
the
other
experiment
we
find
that
the
pleasure
produces
the
pride
by
a
transition
along
related
ideas
because
when
we
cut
off
that
relation
the
passion
is
immediately
a
surprising
adventure
in
which
we
have
been
ourselves
engaged
is
related
to
us
and
by
that
means
produces
pride
but
the
adventures
of
others
though
they
may
cause
pleasure
yet
for
want
of
this
relation
of
ideas
never
excite
that
passion
what
farther
proof
can
be
desired
for
the
present
system
there
is
only
one
objection
to
this
system
with
regard
to
our
body
which
is
that
though
nothing
be
more
agreeable
than
health
and
more
painful
than
sickness
yet
commonly
men
are
neither
proud
of
the
one
nor
mortifyed
with
the
other
this
will
easily
be
accounted
for
if
we
consider
the
second
and
fourth
limitations
proposed
to
our
general
system
it
was
observed
that
no
object
ever
produces
pride
or
humility
if
it
has
not
something
peculiar
to
ourself
as
also
that
every
cause
of
that
passion
must
be
in
some
measure
constant
and
hold
some
proportion
to
the
duration
of
our
self
which
is
its
object
now
as
health
and
sickness
vary
incessantly
to
all
men
and
there
is
none
who
is
solely
or
certainly
fixed
in
either
these
accidental
blessings
and
calamities
are
in
a
manner
separated
from
us
and
are
never
considered
as
connected
with
our
being
and
existence
and
that
this
account
is
just
appears
hence
that
wherever
a
malady
of
any
kind
is
so
rooted
in
our
constitution
that
we
no
longer
entertain
any
hopes
of
recovery
from
that
moment
it
becomes
an
object
of
humility
as
is
evident
in
old
men
whom
nothing
mortifies
more
than
the
consideration
of
their
age
and
infirmities
they
endeavour
as
long
as
possible
to
conceal
their
blindness
and
deafness
their
rheums
and
gouts
nor
do
they
ever
confess
them
without
reluctance
and
uneasiness
and
though
young
men
are
not
ashamed
of
every
or
cold
they
fall
into
yet
no
topic
is
so
proper
to
mortify
human
pride
and
make
us
entertain
a
mean
opinion
of
our
nature
than
this
that
we
are
every
moment
of
our
lives
subject
to
such
infirmities
this
sufficiently
proves
that
bodily
pain
and
sickness
are
in
themselves
proper
causes
of
humility
though
the
custom
of
estimating
every
thing
by
comparison
more
than
by
its
intrinsic
worth
and
value
makes
us
overlook
these
calamities
which
we
find
to
be
incident
to
every
one
and
causes
us
to
form
an
idea
of
our
merit
and
character
independent
of
them
we
are
ashamed
of
such
maladies
as
affect
others
and
are
either
dangerous
or
disagreeable
to
them
of
the
epilepsy
because
it
gives
a
horror
to
every
one
present
of
the
itch
because
it
is
infectious
of
the
because
it
commonly
goes
to
posterity
men
always
consider
the
sentiments
of
others
in
their
judgment
of
themselves
this
has
evidently
appeared
in
some
of
the
foregoing
reasonings
and
will
appear
still
more
evidently
and
be
more
fully
explained
afterwards
sect
ix
of
external
advantages
and
disadvantages
but
though
pride
and
humility
have
the
qualities
of
our
mind
and
body
that
is
self
for
their
natural
and
more
immediate
causes
we
find
by
experience
that
there
are
many
other
objects
which
produce
these
affections
and
that
the
primary
one
is
in
some
measure
obscured
and
lost
by
the
multiplicity
of
foreign
and
extrinsic
we
found
a
vanity
upon
houses
gardens
equipages
as
well
as
upon
personal
merit
and
accomplishments
and
though
these
external
advantages
be
in
themselves
widely
distant
from
thought
or
a
person
yet
they
considerably
influence
even
a
passion
which
is
directed
to
that
as
its
ultimate
object
this
happens
when
external
objects
acquire
any
particular
relation
to
ourselves
and
are
associated
or
connected
with
us
a
beautiful
fish
in
the
ocean
an
animal
in
a
desart
and
indeed
any
thing
that
neither
belongs
nor
is
related
to
us
has
no
manner
of
influence
on
our
vanity
whatever
extraordinary
qualities
it
may
be
endowed
with
and
whatever
degree
of
surprize
and
admiration
it
may
naturally
occasion
it
must
be
some
way
associated
with
us
in
order
to
touch
our
pride
its
idea
must
hang
in
a
manner
upon
that
of
ourselves
and
the
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
must
be
easy
and
natural
but
here
it
is
remarkable
that
though
the
relation
of
resemblance
operates
upon
the
mind
in
the
same
manner
as
contiguity
and
causation
in
conveying
us
from
one
idea
to
another
yet
it
is
seldom
a
foundation
either
of
pride
or
of
humility
if
we
resemble
a
person
in
any
of
the
valuable
parts
of
his
character
we
must
in
some
degree
possess
the
quality
in
which
we
resemble
him
and
this
quality
we
always
chuse
to
survey
directly
in
ourselves
rather
than
by
reflexion
in
another
person
when
we
would
found
upon
it
any
degree
of
vanity
so
that
though
a
likeness
may
occasionally
produce
that
passion
by
suggesting
a
more
advantageous
idea
of
ourselves
it
is
there
the
view
fixes
at
last
and
the
passion
finds
its
ultimate
and
final
cause
there
are
instances
indeed
wherein
men
shew
a
vanity
in
resembling
a
great
man
in
his
countenance
shape
air
or
other
minute
circumstances
that
contribute
not
in
any
degree
to
his
reputation
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
extends
not
very
far
nor
is
of
any
considerable
moment
in
these
affections
for
this
i
assign
the
following
reason
we
can
never
have
a
vanity
of
resembling
in
trifles
any
person
unless
he
be
possessed
of
very
shining
qualities
which
give
us
a
respect
and
veneration
for
him
these
qualities
then
are
properly
speaking
the
causes
of
our
vanity
by
means
of
their
relation
to
ourselves
now
after
what
manner
are
they
related
to
ourselves
they
are
parts
of
the
person
we
value
and
consequently
connected
with
these
trifles
which
are
also
supposed
to
be
parts
of
him
these
trifles
are
connected
with
the
resembling
qualities
in
us
and
these
qualities
in
us
being
parts
are
connected
with
the
whole
and
by
that
means
form
a
chain
of
several
links
of
the
person
we
resemble
but
besides
that
this
multitude
of
relations
must
weaken
the
connexion
it
is
evident
the
mind
in
passing
from
the
shining
qualities
to
the
trivial
ones
must
by
that
contrast
the
better
perceive
the
minuteness
of
the
latter
and
be
in
some
measure
ashamed
of
the
comparison
and
resemblance
the
relation
therefore
of
contiguity
or
that
of
causation
betwixt
the
cause
and
object
of
pride
and
humility
is
alone
requisite
to
give
rise
to
these
passions
and
these
relations
are
nothing
else
but
qualities
by
which
the
imagination
is
conveyed
from
one
idea
to
another
now
let
us
consider
what
effect
these
can
possibly
have
upon
the
mind
and
by
what
means
they
become
so
requisite
to
the
production
of
the
passions
it
is
evident
that
the
association
of
ideas
operates
in
so
silent
and
imperceptible
a
manner
that
we
are
scarce
sensible
of
it
and
discover
it
more
by
its
effects
than
by
any
immediate
feeling
or
perception
it
produces
no
emotion
and
gives
rise
to
no
new
impression
of
any
kind
but
only
modifies
those
ideas
of
which
the
mind
was
formerly
possessed
and
which
it
coued
recal
upon
occasion
from
this
reasoning
as
well
as
from
undoubted
experience
we
may
conclude
that
an
association
of
ideas
however
necessary
is
not
alone
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
any
passion
it
is
evident
then
that
when
the
mind
feels
the
passion
either
of
pride
or
humility
upon
the
appearance
of
related
object
there
is
beside
the
relation
or
transition
of
thought
an
emotion
or
original
impression
produced
by
some
other
principle
the
question
is
whether
the
emotion
first
produced
be
the
passion
itself
or
some
other
impression
related
to
it
this
question
we
can
not
be
long
in
deciding
for
besides
all
the
other
arguments
with
which
this
subject
abounds
it
must
evidently
appear
that
the
relation
of
ideas
which
experience
shews
to
be
so
requisite
a
circumstance
to
the
production
of
the
passion
would
be
entirely
superfluous
were
it
not
to
second
a
relation
of
affections
and
facilitate
the
transition
from
one
impression
to
another
if
nature
produced
immediately
the
passion
of
pride
or
humility
it
would
be
compleated
in
itself
and
would
require
no
farther
addition
or
encrease
from
any
other
affection
but
supposing
the
first
emotion
to
be
only
related
to
pride
or
humility
it
is
easily
conceived
to
what
purpose
the
relation
of
objects
may
serve
and
how
the
two
different
associations
of
impressions
and
ideas
by
uniting
their
forces
may
assist
each
other
operation
this
is
not
only
easily
conceived
but
i
will
venture
to
affirm
it
is
the
only
manner
in
which
we
can
conceive
this
subject
an
easy
transition
of
ideas
which
of
itself
causes
no
emotion
can
never
be
necessary
or
even
useful
to
the
passions
but
by
forwarding
the
transition
betwixt
some
related
impressions
not
to
mention
that
the
same
object
causes
a
greater
or
smaller
degree
of
pride
not
only
in
proportion
to
the
encrease
or
decrease
of
its
qualities
but
also
to
the
distance
or
nearness
of
the
relation
which
is
a
clear
argument
for
the
transition
of
affections
along
the
relation
of
ideas
since
every
change
in
the
relation
produces
a
proportionable
change
in
the
passion
thus
one
part
of
the
preceding
system
concerning
the
relations
of
ideas
is
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
other
concerning
that
of
impressions
and
is
itself
so
evidently
founded
on
experience
that
it
would
be
lost
time
to
endeavour
farther
to
prove
it
this
will
appear
still
more
evidently
in
particular
instances
men
are
vain
of
the
beauty
of
their
country
of
their
county
of
their
parish
here
the
idea
of
beauty
plainly
produces
a
pleasure
this
pleasure
is
related
to
pride
the
object
or
cause
of
this
pleasure
is
by
the
supposition
related
to
self
or
the
object
of
pride
by
this
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
a
transition
is
made
from
the
one
impression
to
the
other
men
are
also
vain
of
the
temperature
of
the
climate
in
which
they
were
born
of
the
fertility
of
their
native
soil
of
the
goodness
of
the
wines
fruits
or
victuals
produced
by
it
of
the
softness
or
force
of
their
language
with
other
particulars
of
that
kind
these
objects
have
plainly
a
reference
to
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
and
are
originally
considered
as
agreeable
to
the
feeling
taste
or
hearing
how
is
it
possible
they
coued
ever
become
objects
of
pride
except
by
means
of
that
transition
there
are
some
that
discover
a
vanity
of
an
opposite
kind
and
affect
to
depreciate
their
own
country
in
comparison
of
those
to
which
they
have
travelled
these
persons
find
when
they
are
at
home
and
surrounded
with
their
countrymen
that
the
strong
relation
betwixt
them
and
their
own
nation
is
shared
with
so
many
that
it
is
in
a
manner
lost
to
them
whereas
their
distant
relation
to
a
foreign
country
which
is
formed
by
their
having
seen
it
and
lived
in
it
is
augmented
by
their
considering
how
few
there
are
who
have
done
the
same
for
this
reason
they
always
admire
the
beauty
utility
and
rarity
of
what
is
abroad
above
what
is
at
home
since
we
can
be
vain
of
a
country
climate
or
any
inanimate
object
which
bears
a
relation
to
us
it
is
no
wonder
we
are
vain
of
the
qualities
of
those
who
are
connected
with
us
by
blood
or
friendship
accordingly
we
find
that
the
very
same
qualities
which
in
ourselves
produce
pride
produce
also
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
affection
when
discovered
in
persons
related
to
us
the
beauty
address
merit
credit
and
honours
of
their
kindred
are
carefully
displayed
by
the
proud
as
some
of
their
most
considerable
sources
of
their
vanity
as
we
are
proud
of
riches
in
ourselves
so
to
satisfy
our
vanity
we
desire
that
every
one
who
has
any
connexion
with
us
should
likewise
be
possest
of
them
and
are
ashamed
of
any
one
that
is
mean
or
poor
among
our
friends
and
relations
for
this
reason
we
remove
the
poor
as
far
from
us
as
possible
and
as
we
can
not
prevent
poverty
in
some
distant
collaterals
and
our
forefathers
are
taken
to
be
our
nearest
relations
upon
this
account
every
one
affects
to
be
of
a
good
family
and
to
be
descended
from
a
long
succession
of
rich
and
honourable
ancestors
i
have
frequently
observed
that
those
who
boast
of
the
antiquity
of
their
families
are
glad
when
they
can
join
this
circumstance
that
their
ancestors
for
many
generations
have
been
uninterrupted
proprietors
of
the
same
portion
of
land
and
that
their
family
has
never
changed
its
possessions
or
been
transplanted
into
any
other
county
or
province
i
have
also
observed
that
it
is
an
additional
subject
of
vanity
when
they
can
boast
that
these
possessions
have
been
transmitted
through
a
descent
composed
entirely
of
males
and
that
the
honour
and
fortune
have
never
past
through
any
female
let
us
endeavour
to
explain
these
phaenomena
by
the
foregoing
system
it
is
evident
that
when
any
one
boasts
of
the
antiquity
of
his
family
the
subjects
of
his
vanity
are
not
merely
the
extent
of
time
and
number
of
ancestors
but
also
their
riches
and
credit
which
are
supposed
to
reflect
a
lustre
on
himself
on
account
of
his
relation
to
them
he
first
considers
these
objects
is
affected
by
them
in
an
agreeable
manner
and
then
returning
back
to
himself
through
the
relation
of
parent
and
child
is
elevated
with
the
passion
of
pride
by
means
of
the
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
since
therefore
the
passion
depends
on
these
relations
whatever
strengthens
any
of
the
relations
must
also
encrease
the
passion
and
whatever
weakens
the
relations
must
diminish
the
passion
now
it
is
certain
the
identity
of
the
possesion
strengthens
the
relation
of
ideas
arising
from
blood
and
kindred
and
conveys
the
fancy
with
greater
facility
from
one
generation
to
another
from
the
remote
ancestors
to
their
posterity
who
are
both
their
heirs
and
their
descendants
by
this
facility
the
impression
is
transmitted
more
entire
and
excites
a
greater
degree
of
pride
and
vanity
the
case
is
the
same
with
the
transmission
of
the
honours
and
fortune
through
a
succession
of
males
without
their
passing
through
any
female
it
is
a
quality
of
human
nature
which
we
shall
consider
part
ii
sect
afterwards
that
the
imagination
naturally
turns
to
whatever
is
important
and
considerable
and
where
two
objects
are
presented
to
it
a
small
and
a
great
one
usually
leaves
the
former
and
dwells
entirely
upon
the
latter
as
in
the
society
of
marriage
the
male
sex
has
the
advantage
above
the
female
the
husband
first
engages
our
attention
and
whether
we
consider
him
directly
or
reach
him
by
passing
through
related
objects
the
thought
both
rests
upon
him
with
greater
satisfaction
and
arrives
at
him
with
greater
facility
than
his
consort
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
property
must
strengthen
the
relation
to
the
father
and
weaken
that
to
the
mother
for
as
all
relations
are
nothing
hut
a
propensity
to
pass
from
one
idea
ma
another
whatever
strengthens
the
propensity
strengthens
the
relation
and
as
we
have
a
stronger
propensity
to
pass
from
the
idea
of
the
children
to
that
of
the
father
than
from
the
same
idea
to
that
of
the
mother
we
ought
to
regard
the
former
relation
as
the
closer
and
more
considerable
this
is
the
reason
why
children
commonly
bear
their
father
name
and
are
esteemed
to
be
of
nobler
or
baser
birth
according
to
his
family
and
though
the
mother
should
be
possest
of
a
superior
spirit
and
genius
to
the
father
as
often
happens
the
general
rule
prevails
notwithstanding
the
exceprion
according
to
the
doctrine
nay
even
when
a
superiority
of
any
kind
is
so
great
or
when
any
other
reasons
have
such
an
effect
as
to
make
the
children
rather
represent
the
family
than
the
father
the
general
rule
still
retains
such
an
efficacy
that
it
weakens
the
relation
and
makes
a
kind
of
break
in
the
line
of
ancestors
the
imagination
runs
not
along
them
with
facility
nor
is
able
to
transfer
the
honour
and
credit
of
the
ancestors
to
their
posterity
of
the
same
name
and
family
so
readily
as
when
the
transition
is
conformable
to
the
general
rules
and
passes
from
father
to
son
or
from
brother
to
brother
sect
x
of
property
and
riches
but
the
relation
which
is
esteemed
the
closest
and
which
of
all
others
produces
most
commonly
the
passion
of
pride
is
that
of
property
this
relation
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
fully
to
explain
before
i
come
to
treat
of
justice
and
the
other
moral
virtues
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
on
this
occasion
that
property
may
be
defined
such
a
relation
betwixt
a
person
and
an
object
as
permits
him
but
forbids
any
other
the
free
use
and
possession
of
it
without
violating
the
laws
of
justice
and
moral
equity
if
justice
therefore
be
a
virtue
which
has
a
natural
and
original
influence
on
the
human
mind
property
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
particular
species
of
causation
whether
we
consider
the
liberty
it
gives
the
proprietor
to
operate
as
he
please
upon
the
object
or
the
advantages
which
he
reaps
from
it
it
is
the
same
case
if
justice
according
to
the
system
of
certain
philosophers
should
be
esteemed
an
artificial
and
not
a
natural
virtue
for
then
honour
and
custom
and
civil
laws
supply
the
place
of
natural
conscience
and
produce
in
some
degree
the
same
effects
this
in
the
mean
time
is
certain
that
the
mention
of
the
property
naturally
carries
our
thought
to
the
proprietor
and
of
the
proprietor
to
the
property
which
being
a
proof
of
a
perfect
relation
of
ideas
is
all
that
is
requisite
to
our
present
purpose
a
relation
of
ideas
joined
to
that
of
impressions
always
produces
a
transition
of
affections
and
therefore
whenever
any
pleasure
or
pain
arises
from
an
object
connected
with
us
by
property
we
may
be
certain
that
either
pride
or
humility
must
arise
from
this
conjunction
of
relations
if
the
foregoing
system
be
solid
and
satisfactory
and
whether
it
be
so
or
not
we
may
soon
satisfy
ourselves
by
the
most
cursory
view
of
human
life
every
thing
belonging
to
a
vain
man
is
the
best
that
is
any
where
to
be
found
his
houses
equipage
furniture
doaths
horses
hounds
excel
all
others
in
his
conceit
and
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
from
the
least
advantage
in
any
of
these
he
draws
a
new
subject
of
pride
and
vanity
his
wine
if
you
believe
him
has
a
finer
flavour
than
any
other
his
cookery
is
more
exquisite
his
table
more
orderly
his
servants
more
expert
the
air
in
which
he
lives
more
healthful
the
soil
he
cultivates
more
fertile
his
fruits
ripen
earlier
and
to
greater
perfection
such
a
thing
is
remarkable
for
its
novelty
such
another
for
its
antiquity
this
is
the
workmanship
of
a
famous
artist
that
belonged
once
to
such
a
prince
or
great
man
all
objects
in
a
word
that
are
useful
beautiful
or
surprising
or
are
related
to
such
may
by
means
of
property
give
rise
to
this
passion
these
agree
in
giving
pleasure
and
agree
in
nothing
else
this
alone
is
common
to
them
and
therefore
must
be
the
quality
that
produces
the
passion
which
is
their
common
effect
as
every
new
instance
is
a
new
argument
and
as
the
instances
are
here
without
number
i
may
venture
to
affirm
that
scarce
any
system
was
ever
so
fully
proved
by
experience
as
that
which
i
have
here
advanced
if
the
property
of
any
thing
that
gives
pleasure
either
by
its
utility
beauty
or
novelty
produces
also
pride
by
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
we
need
not
be
surprized
that
the
power
of
acquiring
this
property
should
have
the
same
effect
now
riches
are
to
be
considered
as
the
power
of
acquiring
the
property
of
what
pleases
and
it
is
only
in
this
view
they
have
any
influence
on
the
passions
paper
will
on
many
occasions
be
considered
as
riches
and
that
because
it
may
convey
the
power
of
acquiring
money
and
money
is
not
riches
as
it
is
a
metal
endowed
with
certain
qualities
of
solidity
weight
and
fusibility
but
only
as
it
has
a
relation
to
the
pleasures
and
conveniences
of
life
taking
then
this
for
granted
which
is
in
itself
so
evident
we
may
draw
from
it
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
i
have
yet
employed
to
prove
the
influence
of
the
double
relations
on
pride
and
humility
it
has
been
observed
in
treating
of
the
understanding
that
the
distinction
which
we
sometimes
make
betwixt
a
power
and
the
exercise
of
it
is
entirely
frivolous
and
that
neither
man
nor
any
other
being
ought
ever
to
be
thought
possest
of
any
ability
unless
it
be
exerted
and
put
in
action
but
though
this
be
strictly
true
in
a
just
and
philosophical
way
of
thinking
it
is
certain
it
is
not
the
philosophy
of
our
passions
but
that
many
things
operate
upon
them
by
means
of
the
idea
and
supposition
of
power
independent
of
its
actual
exercise
we
are
pleased
when
we
acquire
an
ability
of
procuring
pleasure
and
are
displeased
when
another
acquires
a
power
of
giving
pain
this
is
evident
from
experience
but
in
order
to
give
a
just
explication
of
the
matter
and
account
for
this
satisfaction
and
uneasiness
we
must
weigh
the
following
reflections
it
is
evident
the
error
of
distinguishing
power
from
its
exercise
proceeds
not
entirely
from
the
scholastic
doctrine
of
which
indeed
enters
very
little
into
common
life
and
has
but
small
influence
on
our
vulgar
and
popular
ways
of
thinking
according
to
that
doctrine
motives
deprive
us
not
of
nor
take
away
our
power
of
performing
or
forbearing
any
action
but
according
to
common
notions
a
man
has
no
power
where
very
considerable
motives
lie
betwixt
him
and
the
satisfaction
of
his
desires
and
determine
him
to
forbear
what
he
wishes
to
perform
i
do
not
think
i
have
fallen
into
my
enemy
power
when
i
see
him
pass
me
in
the
streets
with
a
sword
by
his
side
while
i
am
unprovided
of
any
weapon
i
know
that
the
fear
of
the
civil
magistrate
is
as
strong
a
restraint
as
any
of
iron
and
that
i
am
in
as
perfect
safety
as
if
he
were
chained
or
imprisoned
but
when
a
person
acquires
such
an
authority
over
me
that
not
only
there
is
no
external
obstacle
to
his
actions
but
also
that
he
may
punish
or
reward
me
as
he
pleases
without
any
dread
of
punishment
in
his
turn
i
then
attribute
a
full
power
to
him
and
consider
myself
as
his
subject
or
vassal
now
if
we
compare
these
two
cases
that
of
a
person
who
has
very
strong
motives
of
interest
or
safety
to
forbear
any
action
and
that
of
another
who
lies
under
no
such
obligation
we
shall
find
according
to
the
philosophy
explained
in
the
foregoing
book
that
the
only
known
difference
betwixt
them
lies
in
this
that
in
the
former
case
we
conclude
from
past
experience
that
the
person
never
will
perform
that
action
and
in
the
latter
that
he
possibly
or
probably
will
perform
it
nothing
is
more
fluctuating
and
inconstant
on
many
occasions
than
the
will
of
man
nor
is
there
any
thing
but
strong
motives
which
can
give
us
an
absolute
certainty
in
pronouncing
concerning
any
of
his
future
actions
when
we
see
a
person
free
from
these
motives
we
suppose
a
possibility
either
of
his
acting
or
forbearing
and
though
in
general
we
may
conclude
him
to
be
determined
by
motives
and
causes
yet
this
removes
not
the
uncertainty
of
our
judgment
concerning
these
causes
nor
the
influence
of
that
uncertainty
on
the
passions
since
therefore
we
ascribe
a
power
of
performing
an
action
to
every
one
who
has
no
very
powerful
motive
to
forbear
it
and
refuse
it
to
such
as
have
it
may
justly
be
concluded
that
power
has
always
a
reference
to
its
exercise
either
actual
or
probable
and
that
we
consider
a
person
as
endowed
with
any
ability
when
we
find
from
past
experience
that
it
is
probable
or
at
least
possible
he
may
exert
it
and
indeed
as
our
passions
always
regard
the
real
existence
of
objects
and
we
always
judge
of
this
reality
from
past
instances
nothing
can
be
more
likely
of
itself
without
any
farther
reasoning
than
that
power
consists
in
the
possibility
or
probability
of
any
action
as
discovered
by
experience
and
the
practice
of
the
world
now
it
is
evident
that
wherever
a
person
is
in
such
a
situadon
with
regard
to
me
that
there
is
no
very
powerful
motive
to
deter
him
from
injuring
me
and
consequently
it
is
uncertain
whether
he
will
injure
me
or
not
i
must
be
uneasy
in
such
a
situation
and
can
not
consider
the
possibility
or
probability
of
that
injury
without
a
sensible
concern
the
passions
are
not
only
affected
by
such
events
as
are
certain
and
infallible
but
also
in
an
inferior
degree
by
such
as
are
possible
and
contingent
and
though
perhaps
i
never
really
feel
any
harm
and
discover
by
the
event
that
philosophically
speaking
the
person
never
had
any
power
of
harming
me
since
he
did
not
exert
any
this
prevents
not
my
uneasiness
from
the
preceding
uncertainty
the
agreeable
passions
may
here
operate
as
well
as
the
uneasy
and
convey
a
pleasure
when
i
perceive
a
good
to
become
either
possible
or
probable
by
the
possibility
or
probability
of
another
bestowing
it
on
me
upon
the
removal
of
any
strong
motives
which
might
formerly
have
hindered
him
but
we
may
farther
observe
that
this
satisfaction
encreases
when
any
good
approaches
in
such
a
manner
that
it
it
in
one
own
power
to
take
or
leave
it
and
there
neither
is
any
physical
impediment
nor
any
very
strong
motive
to
hinder
our
enjoyment
as
all
men
desire
pleasure
nothing
can
be
more
probable
than
its
existence
when
there
is
no
external
obstacle
to
the
producing
it
and
men
perceive
no
danger
in
following
their
inclinations
in
that
case
their
imagination
easily
anticipates
the
satisfaction
and
conveys
the
same
joy
as
if
they
were
persuaded
of
its
real
and
actual
existence
but
this
accounts
not
sufficiently
for
the
satisfaction
which
attends
riches
a
miser
receives
delight
from
his
money
that
is
from
the
power
it
affords
him
of
procuring
all
the
pleasures
and
conveniences
of
life
though
he
knows
he
has
enjoyed
his
riches
for
forty
years
without
ever
employing
them
and
consequently
can
not
conclude
by
any
species
of
reasoning
that
the
real
existence
of
these
pleasures
is
nearer
than
if
he
were
entirely
deprived
of
all
his
possessions
but
though
he
can
not
form
any
such
conclusion
in
a
way
of
reasoning
concerning
she
nearer
approach
of
the
pleasure
it
is
certain
he
imagines
it
to
approach
nearer
whenever
all
external
obstacles
are
removed
along
with
the
more
powerful
motives
of
interest
and
danger
which
oppose
it
for
farther
satisfaction
on
this
head
i
must
refer
to
my
account
of
the
will
where
i
shall
part
iii
sect
explain
that
false
sensation
of
liberty
which
make
us
imagine
we
can
perform
any
thing
that
is
not
very
dangerous
or
destructive
whenever
any
other
person
is
under
no
strong
obligations
of
interest
to
forbear
any
pleasure
we
judge
from
experience
that
the
pleasure
will
exist
and
that
he
will
probably
obtain
it
but
when
ourselves
are
in
that
situation
we
judge
from
an
illusion
of
the
fancy
that
the
pleasure
is
still
closer
and
more
immediate
the
will
seems
to
move
easily
every
way
and
casts
a
shadow
or
image
of
itself
even
to
that
side
on
which
it
did
not
settle
by
means
of
this
image
the
enjoyment
seems
to
approach
nearer
to
us
and
gives
us
the
same
lively
satisfaction
as
if
it
were
perfectly
certain
and
unavoidable
it
will
now
be
easy
to
draw
this
whole
reasoning
to
a
paint
and
to
prove
that
when
riches
produce
any
pride
or
vanity
in
their
possessors
as
they
never
fail
so
do
it
is
only
by
means
of
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
the
very
essence
of
riches
consists
in
the
power
of
procuring
the
pleasures
and
conveniences
of
life
the
very
essence
of
this
consists
in
the
probability
of
its
exercise
and
in
its
causing
us
to
anticipate
by
a
true
or
false
reasoning
the
real
existence
of
the
pleasure
this
anticipation
of
pleasure
is
in
itself
a
very
considerable
pleasure
and
as
its
cause
is
some
possession
or
property
which
we
enjoy
and
which
is
thereby
related
to
us
we
here
dearly
see
all
the
parts
of
the
foregoing
system
most
exactly
and
distinctly
drawn
out
before
us
for
the
same
reason
that
riches
cause
pleasure
and
pride
and
poverty
excites
uneasiness
and
humility
power
must
produce
the
former
emotions
and
slavery
the
latter
power
or
an
authority
over
others
makes
us
capable
of
satisfying
all
our
desires
as
slavery
by
subjecting
us
to
the
will
of
others
exposes
us
to
a
thousand
wants
and
mortifications
it
is
here
worth
observing
that
the
vanity
of
power
or
shame
of
slavery
are
much
augmented
by
the
consideration
of
the
persons
over
whom
we
exercise
our
authority
or
who
exercise
it
over
us
for
supposing
it
possible
to
frame
statues
of
such
an
admirable
mechanism
that
they
coued
move
and
act
in
obedience
to
the
will
it
is
evident
the
possession
of
them
would
give
pleasure
and
pride
but
not
to
such
a
degree
as
the
same
authority
when
exerted
over
sensible
and
rational
creatures
whose
condition
being
compared
to
our
own
makes
it
seem
more
agreeable
and
honourable
comparison
is
in
every
case
a
sure
method
of
augmenting
our
esteem
of
any
thing
a
rich
man
feels
the
felicity
of
his
condition
better
by
opposing
it
to
that
of
a
beggar
but
there
is
a
peculiar
advantage
in
power
by
the
contrast
which
is
in
a
manner
presented
to
us
betwixt
ourselves
and
the
person
we
command
the
comparison
is
obvious
and
natural
the
imagination
finds
it
in
the
very
subject
the
passage
of
the
thought
to
its
conception
is
smooth
and
easy
and
that
this
circumstance
has
a
considerable
effect
in
augmenting
its
influence
will
appear
afterwards
in
examining
the
nature
of
malice
and
envy
sect
xi
of
the
love
of
fame
but
beside
these
original
causes
of
pride
and
humility
there
is
a
secondary
one
in
the
opinions
of
others
which
has
an
equal
influence
on
the
affections
our
reputation
our
character
our
name
are
considerations
of
vast
weight
and
importance
and
even
the
other
causes
of
pride
virtue
beauty
and
riches
have
little
influence
when
not
seconded
by
the
opinions
and
sentiments
of
others
in
order
to
account
for
this
phaenomenon
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
some
compass
and
first
explain
the
nature
of
sympathy
no
quality
of
human
nature
is
more
remarkable
both
in
itself
and
in
its
consequences
than
that
propensity
we
have
to
sympathize
with
others
and
to
receive
by
communication
their
inclinations
and
sentiments
however
different
from
or
even
contrary
to
our
own
this
is
not
only
conspicuous
in
children
who
implicitly
embrace
every
opinion
proposed
to
them
but
also
in
men
of
the
greatest
judgment
and
understanding
who
find
it
very
difficult
to
follow
their
own
reason
or
inclination
in
opposition
to
that
of
their
friends
and
daily
companions
to
this
principle
we
ought
to
ascribe
the
great
uniformity
we
may
observe
in
the
humours
and
turn
of
thinking
of
those
of
the
same
nation
and
it
is
much
more
probable
that
this
resemblance
arises
from
sympathy
than
from
any
influence
of
the
soil
and
climate
which
though
they
continue
invariably
the
same
are
not
able
to
preserve
the
character
of
a
nation
the
same
for
a
century
together
a
man
finds
himself
in
an
instant
of
the
same
humour
with
his
company
and
even
the
proudest
and
most
surly
take
a
tincture
from
their
countrymen
and
acquaintance
a
chearful
countenance
infuses
a
sensible
complacency
and
serenity
into
my
mind
as
an
angry
or
sorrowful
one
throws
a
sudden
dump
upon
me
hatred
resentment
esteem
love
courage
mirth
and
melancholy
all
these
passions
i
feel
more
from
communication
than
from
my
own
natural
temper
and
disposition
so
remarkable
a
phaenomenon
merits
our
attention
and
must
be
traced
up
to
its
first
principles
when
any
affection
is
infused
by
sympathy
it
is
at
first
known
only
by
its
effects
and
by
those
external
signs
in
the
countenance
and
conversation
which
convey
an
idea
of
it
this
idea
is
presently
converted
into
an
impression
and
acquires
such
a
degree
of
force
and
vivacity
as
to
become
the
very
passion
itself
and
produce
an
equal
emotion
as
any
original
affection
however
instantaneous
this
change
of
the
idea
into
an
impression
may
be
it
proceeds
from
certain
views
and
reflections
which
will
not
escape
the
strict
scrutiny
of
philosopher
though
they
may
the
person
himself
who
makes
them
it
is
evident
that
the
idea
or
rather
impression
of
ourselves
is
always
intimately
present
with
us
and
that
our
consciousness
gives
us
so
lively
a
conception
of
our
own
person
that
it
is
not
possible
to
imagine
that
any
thing
can
in
this
particular
go
beyond
it
whatever
object
therefore
is
related
to
ourselves
must
be
conceived
with
a
little
vivacity
of
conception
according
to
the
foregoing
principles
and
though
this
relation
should
not
be
so
strong
as
that
of
causation
it
must
still
have
a
considerable
influence
resemblance
and
contiguity
are
relations
not
to
be
neglected
especially
when
by
an
inference
from
cause
and
effect
and
by
the
observation
of
external
signs
we
are
informed
of
the
real
existence
of
the
object
which
is
resembling
or
contiguous
now
it
is
obvious
that
nature
has
preserved
a
great
resemblance
among
all
human
creatures
and
that
we
never
remark
any
passion
or
principle
in
others
of
which
in
some
degree
or
other
we
may
not
find
a
parallel
in
ourselves
the
case
is
the
same
with
the
fabric
of
the
mind
as
with
that
of
the
body
however
the
parts
may
differ
in
shape
or
size
their
structure
and
composition
are
in
general
the
same
there
is
a
very
remarkable
resemblance
which
preserves
itself
amidst
all
their
variety
and
this
resemblance
must
very
much
contribute
to
make
us
enter
into
the
sentiments
of
others
and
embrace
them
with
facility
and
pleasure
accordingly
we
find
that
where
beside
the
general
resemblance
of
our
natures
there
is
any
peculiar
similarity
in
our
manners
or
character
or
country
or
language
it
facilitates
the
sympathy
the
stronger
the
relation
is
betwixt
ourselves
and
any
object
the
more
easily
does
the
imagination
make
the
transition
and
convey
to
the
related
idea
the
vivacity
of
conception
with
which
we
always
form
the
idea
of
our
own
person
nor
is
resemblance
the
only
relation
which
has
this
effect
but
receives
new
force
from
other
relations
that
may
accompany
it
the
sentiments
of
others
have
little
influence
when
far
removed
from
us
and
require
the
relation
of
contiguity
to
make
them
communicate
themselves
entirely
the
relations
of
blood
being
a
species
of
causation
may
sometimes
contribute
to
the
same
effect
as
also
acquaintance
which
operates
in
the
same
manner
with
education
and
custom
as
we
shall
see
more
fully
part
ii
sect
afterwards
all
these
relations
when
united
together
convey
the
impression
or
consciousness
of
our
own
person
to
the
idea
of
the
sentiments
or
passions
of
others
and
makes
us
conceive
them
in
the
strongest
and
most
lively
manner
it
has
been
remarked
in
the
beginning
of
this
treatise
that
all
ideas
are
borrowed
from
impressions
and
that
these
two
kinds
of
perceptions
differ
only
in
the
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
with
which
they
strike
upon
the
soul
the
component
part
of
ideas
and
impressions
are
precisely
alike
the
manner
and
order
of
their
appearance
may
be
the
same
the
different
degrees
of
their
force
and
vivacity
are
therefore
the
only
particulars
that
distinguish
them
and
as
this
difference
may
be
removed
in
some
measure
by
a
relation
betwixt
the
impressions
and
ideas
it
is
no
wonder
an
idea
of
a
sentiment
or
passion
may
by
this
means
be
inlivened
as
to
become
the
very
sentiment
or
passion
the
lively
idea
of
any
object
always
approaches
is
impression
and
it
is
certain
we
may
feel
sickness
and
pain
from
the
mere
force
of
imagination
and
make
a
malady
real
by
often
thinking
of
it
but
this
is
most
remarkable
in
the
opinions
and
affections
and
it
is
there
principally
that
a
lively
idea
is
converted
into
an
impression
our
affections
depend
more
upon
ourselves
and
the
internal
operations
of
the
mind
than
any
other
impressions
for
which
reason
they
arise
more
naturally
from
the
imagination
and
from
every
lively
idea
we
form
of
them
this
is
the
nature
and
cause
of
sympathy
and
it
is
after
this
manner
we
enter
so
deep
into
the
opinions
and
affections
of
others
whenever
we
discover
them
what
is
principally
remarkable
in
this
whole
affair
is
the
strong
confirmation
these
phaenomena
give
to
the
foregoing
system
concerning
the
understanding
and
consequently
to
the
present
one
concerning
the
passions
since
these
are
analogous
to
each
other
it
is
indeed
evident
that
when
we
sympathize
with
the
passions
and
sentiments
of
others
these
movements
appear
at
first
in
our
mind
as
mere
ideas
and
are
conceived
to
belong
to
another
person
as
we
conceive
any
other
matter
of
fact
it
is
also
evident
that
the
ideas
of
the
affections
of
others
are
converted
into
the
very
impressions
they
represent
and
that
the
passions
arise
in
conformity
to
the
images
we
form
of
them
all
this
is
an
object
of
the
plainest
experience
and
depends
not
on
any
hypothesis
of
philosophy
that
science
can
only
be
admitted
to
explain
the
phaenomena
though
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
confest
they
are
so
clear
of
themselves
that
there
is
but
little
occasion
to
employ
it
for
besides
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
by
which
we
are
convinced
of
the
reality
of
the
passion
with
which
we
sympathize
besides
this
i
say
we
must
be
assisted
by
the
relations
of
resemblance
and
contiguity
in
order
to
feel
the
sympathy
in
its
full
perfection
and
since
these
relations
can
entirely
convert
an
idea
into
an
impression
and
convey
the
vivacity
of
the
latter
into
the
former
so
perfectly
as
to
lose
nothing
of
it
in
the
transition
we
may
easily
conceive
how
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
alone
may
serve
to
strengthen
and
inliven
an
idea
in
sympathy
there
is
an
evident
conversion
of
an
idea
into
an
impression
this
conversion
arises
from
the
relation
of
objects
to
ourself
ourself
is
always
intimately
present
to
us
let
us
compare
all
these
circumstances
and
we
shall
find
that
sympathy
is
exactly
correspondent
to
the
operations
of
our
understanding
and
even
contains
something
more
surprizing
and
extraordinary
it
is
now
time
to
turn
our
view
from
the
general
consideration
of
sympathy
to
its
influence
on
pride
and
humility
when
these
passions
arise
from
praise
and
blame
from
reputation
and
infamy
we
may
observe
that
no
person
is
ever
praised
by
another
for
any
quality
which
would
not
if
real
produce
of
itself
a
pride
in
the
person
possest
of
it
the
elogiums
either
turn
upon
his
power
or
riches
or
family
or
virtue
all
of
which
are
subjects
of
vanity
that
we
have
already
explained
and
accounted
for
it
is
certain
then
that
if
a
person
considered
himself
in
the
same
light
in
which
he
appears
to
his
admirer
he
would
first
receive
a
separate
pleasure
and
afterwards
a
pride
or
according
to
the
hypothesis
above
explained
now
nothing
is
more
natural
than
for
us
to
embrace
the
opinions
of
others
in
this
particular
both
from
sympathy
which
renders
all
their
sentiments
intimately
present
to
us
and
from
reasoning
which
makes
us
regard
their
judgment
as
a
kind
of
argument
for
what
they
affirm
these
two
principles
of
authority
and
sympathy
influence
almost
all
our
opinions
but
must
have
a
peculiar
influence
when
we
judge
of
our
own
worth
and
character
such
judgments
are
always
attended
with
passion
book
i
part
iii
sect
and
nothing
tends
more
to
disturb
our
understanding
and
precipitate
us
into
any
opinions
however
unreasonable
than
their
connexion
with
passion
which
diffuses
itself
over
the
imagination
and
gives
an
additional
force
to
every
related
idea
to
which
we
may
add
that
being
conscious
of
great
partiality
in
our
own
favour
we
are
peculiarly
pleased
with
any
thing
that
confirms
the
good
opinion
we
have
of
ourselves
and
are
easily
shocked
with
whatever
opposes
it
all
this
appears
very
probable
in
theory
but
in
order
to
bestow
a
full
certainty
on
this
reasoning
we
must
examine
the
phaenonena
of
the
passions
and
see
if
they
agree
with
it
among
these
phaenomena
we
may
esteem
it
a
very
favourable
one
to
our
present
purposes
that
though
fame
in
general
be
agreeable
yet
we
receive
a
much
greater
satisfaction
from
the
approbation
of
those
whom
we
ourselves
esteem
and
approve
of
than
of
those
whom
we
hate
and
despise
in
like
measure
we
are
principally
mortifyed
with
the
contempt
of
persons
upon
whose
judgment
we
set
some
value
and
are
in
a
peat
measure
indifferent
about
the
opinions
of
the
rest
of
mankind
but
if
the
mind
received
from
any
original
instinct
a
desire
of
fame
and
aversion
to
infamy
fame
and
infamy
would
influence
us
without
distinction
and
every
opinion
according
as
it
were
favourabk
or
unfavourable
would
equally
excite
that
desire
or
aversion
the
judgment
of
a
fool
is
the
judgment
of
another
person
as
well
as
that
of
a
wise
man
and
is
only
inferior
in
its
influence
on
our
own
judgment
we
are
not
only
better
pleased
with
the
approbation
of
a
wise
man
than
with
that
of
a
fool
but
receive
an
additional
satisfaction
from
the
former
when
it
is
obtained
after
a
long
and
intimate
acquaintance
this
is
accounted
for
after
the
same
manner
the
praises
of
others
never
give
us
much
pleasure
unless
they
concur
with
our
own
opinion
and
extol
us
for
those
qualities
in
which
we
chiefly
excel
a
mere
soldier
little
values
the
character
of
eloquence
a
gownman
of
courage
a
bishop
of
humour
or
a
merchant
of
learning
whatever
esteem
a
man
may
have
for
any
quality
abstractedly
considered
when
he
is
conscious
he
is
not
possest
of
it
the
opinions
of
the
whole
world
will
give
him
little
pleasure
in
that
particular
and
that
because
they
never
will
be
able
to
draw
his
own
opinion
after
them
nothing
is
more
usual
than
for
men
of
good
families
but
narrow
circumstances
to
leave
their
friends
and
country
and
rather
seek
their
livelihood
by
mean
and
mechanical
employments
among
strangers
than
among
those
who
are
acquainted
with
their
birth
and
education
we
shall
be
unknown
say
they
where
we
go
no
body
will
suspect
from
what
family
we
are
sprung
we
shall
be
removed
from
all
our
friends
and
acquaintance
and
our
poverty
and
meanness
will
by
that
means
sit
more
easy
upon
us
in
examining
these
sentiments
i
find
they
afford
many
very
convincing
arguments
for
my
present
purpose
first
we
may
infer
from
them
that
the
uneasiness
of
being
contemned
depends
on
sympathy
and
that
sympathy
depends
on
the
relation
of
objects
to
ourselves
since
we
are
most
uneasy
under
the
contempt
of
persons
who
are
both
related
to
us
by
blood
and
contiguous
in
place
hence
to
diminish
this
sympathy
and
uneasiness
by
separating
these
relations
and
placing
ourselves
in
a
contiguity
to
strangers
and
at
a
distance
from
relations
secondly
we
may
conclude
that
relations
are
requisite
to
sympathy
not
absolutely
considered
as
relations
but
by
their
influence
in
converting
our
ideas
of
the
sentiments
of
others
into
the
very
sentiments
by
means
of
the
association
betwixt
the
idea
of
their
persons
and
that
of
our
own
for
here
the
relations
of
kindred
and
contiguity
both
subsist
but
not
being
united
in
the
same
persons
they
contribute
in
a
less
degree
to
the
sympathy
thirdly
this
very
circumstance
of
the
diminution
of
sympathy
by
the
separation
of
relations
is
worthy
of
our
attention
suppose
i
am
placed
in
a
poor
condition
among
strangers
and
consequently
am
but
lightly
treated
i
yet
find
myself
easier
in
that
situation
than
when
i
was
every
day
exposed
to
the
contempt
of
my
kindred
and
countrymen
here
i
feel
a
double
contempt
from
my
relations
but
they
are
absent
from
those
about
me
but
they
are
strangers
this
double
contempt
is
likewise
strengthened
by
the
two
relations
of
kindred
and
contiguity
but
as
the
persons
are
not
the
same
who
are
connected
with
me
by
those
two
relations
this
difference
of
ideas
separates
the
impressions
arising
from
the
contempt
and
keeps
them
from
running
into
each
other
the
contempt
of
my
neighbours
has
a
certain
influence
as
has
also
that
of
my
kindred
but
these
influences
are
distinct
and
never
unite
as
when
the
contempt
proceeds
from
persons
who
are
at
once
both
my
neighbours
and
kindred
this
phaenomenon
is
analogous
to
the
system
of
pride
and
humility
which
may
seem
so
extraordinary
to
vulgar
apprehensions
fourthly
a
person
in
these
circumstances
naturally
conceals
his
birth
from
those
among
whom
he
lives
and
is
very
uneasy
if
any
one
suspects
him
to
be
of
a
family
much
superior
to
his
present
fortune
and
way
of
living
every
thing
in
this
world
is
judged
of
by
comparison
what
is
an
immense
fortune
for
a
private
gentleman
is
beggary
for
a
prince
a
peasant
would
think
himself
happy
in
what
can
not
afford
necessaries
for
a
gentleman
when
a
man
has
either
been
acustomed
to
a
more
splendid
way
of
living
or
thinks
himself
intitled
to
it
by
his
birth
and
quality
every
thing
below
is
disagreeable
and
even
shameful
and
it
is
with
she
greatest
industry
he
conceals
his
pretensions
to
a
better
fortune
here
he
himself
knows
his
misfortunes
but
as
those
with
whom
he
lives
are
ignorant
of
them
he
has
the
disagreeable
reflection
and
comparison
suggested
only
by
his
own
thoughts
and
never
receives
it
by
a
sympathy
with
others
which
must
contribute
very
much
so
his
ease
and
satisfaction
if
there
be
any
objections
to
this
hypothesis
that
the
pleasure
which
we
receive
from
praise
arises
from
a
communication
of
sentiments
we
shall
find
uponexamination
that
these
objections
when
taken
in
a
properlight
will
serve
to
confirm
it
popular
fame
may
be
agreeable
even
to
a
man
who
despises
the
vulgar
but
it
is
because
their
multitude
gives
them
additional
weight
and
authority
plagiaries
are
delighted
with
praises
which
they
are
conscious
they
do
not
deserve
but
this
is
a
kind
of
where
the
imagination
amuses
itself
with
its
own
fictions
and
strives
to
render
them
firm
and
stable
by
a
sympathy
with
the
sentiments
of
others
proud
men
are
most
shocked
with
contempt
should
they
do
not
most
readily
assent
to
it
but
it
is
because
of
the
opposition
betwixt
the
passion
which
is
natural
so
them
and
that
received
by
sympathy
a
violent
lover
in
like
manner
is
very
much
disp
pleased
when
you
blame
and
condemn
his
love
though
it
is
evident
your
opposition
can
have
no
influence
but
by
the
hold
it
takes
of
himself
and
by
his
sympathy
with
you
if
he
despises
you
or
perceives
you
are
in
jest
whatever
you
say
has
no
effect
upon
him
sect
xii
of
the
pride
and
humility
of
animals
thus
in
whatever
light
we
consider
this
subject
we
may
still
observe
that
die
causes
of
pride
and
humility
correspond
exactly
to
our
hypothesis
and
that
nothing
can
excite
either
of
these
passions
unless
it
be
both
related
to
ourselves
and
produces
a
pleasure
or
pain
independent
of
the
passion
we
have
not
only
proved
that
a
tendency
to
produce
pleasure
or
pain
is
common
to
all
the
causes
of
pride
or
humility
but
also
that
it
is
the
only
thing
which
is
common
and
consequently
is
the
quality
by
which
they
operate
we
have
farther
proved
that
the
most
considerable
causes
of
these
passions
are
really
nothing
but
the
power
of
producing
either
agreeable
or
uneasy
sensations
and
therefore
that
all
their
effects
and
amongst
the
rest
pride
and
humility
are
derived
solely
from
that
origin
such
simple
and
natural
principles
founded
on
such
solid
proofs
can
not
fail
to
be
received
by
philosophers
unless
opposed
by
some
objections
that
have
escaped
me
it
is
usual
with
anatomists
to
join
their
observations
and
experiments
on
human
bodies
to
those
on
beasts
and
from
the
agreement
of
these
experiments
to
derive
an
additional
argument
for
any
particular
hypothesis
it
is
indeed
certain
that
where
the
structure
of
parts
in
brutes
is
the
same
as
in
men
and
the
operation
of
these
parts
also
the
same
the
causes
of
that
operation
can
not
be
different
and
that
whatever
we
discover
to
be
true
of
the
one
species
may
be
concluded
without
hesitation
to
be
certain
of
the
other
thus
though
the
mixture
of
humours
and
the
composition
of
minute
parts
may
justly
be
presumed
so
be
somewhat
different
in
men
from
what
it
is
in
mere
animals
and
therefore
any
experiment
we
make
upon
the
one
concerning
the
effects
of
medicines
will
not
always
apply
to
the
other
yet
as
the
structure
of
the
veins
and
muscles
the
fabric
and
situation
of
the
heart
of
the
lungs
the
stomach
the
liver
and
other
parts
are
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
in
all
animals
the
very
same
hypothesis
which
in
one
species
explains
muscular
motion
the
progress
of
the
chyle
the
circulation
of
the
blood
must
be
applicable
to
every
one
and
according
as
it
agrees
or
disagrees
with
the
experiments
we
may
make
in
any
species
of
creatures
we
may
draw
a
proof
of
its
truth
or
falshood
on
the
whole
let
us
therefore
apply
this
method
of
enquiry
which
is
found
so
just
and
useful
in
reasonings
concerning
the
body
to
our
present
anatomy
of
the
mind
and
see
what
discoveries
we
can
make
by
it
in
order
to
this
we
must
first
shew
the
correspondence
of
passions
in
men
and
animals
and
afterwards
compare
the
causes
which
produce
these
passions
it
is
plain
that
almost
in
every
species
of
creatures
but
especially
of
the
nobler
kind
there
are
many
evident
marks
of
pride
and
humility
the
very
port
and
gait
of
a
swan
or
turkey
or
peacock
show
the
high
idea
he
has
entertained
of
himself
and
his
contempt
of
all
others
this
is
the
more
remarkable
that
in
the
two
last
species
of
animals
the
pride
always
attends
the
beauty
and
is
discovered
in
the
male
only
the
vanity
and
emulation
of
nightingales
in
singing
have
been
commonly
remarked
as
likewise
that
of
horses
in
swiftness
of
hounds
in
sagacity
and
smell
of
the
bull
and
cock
in
strength
and
of
every
other
animal
in
his
particular
excellency
add
to
this
that
every
species
of
creatures
which
approach
so
often
to
man
as
to
familiarize
themselves
with
him
show
an
evident
pride
in
his
approbation
and
are
pleased
with
his
praises
and
caresses
independent
of
every
other
consideration
nor
are
they
the
caresses
of
every
one
without
distinction
which
give
them
this
vanity
but
those
principally
of
the
persons
they
know
and
love
in
the
same
manner
as
that
passion
is
excited
in
mankind
all
these
are
evident
proofs
that
pride
and
humility
are
not
merely
human
passions
but
extend
themselves
over
the
whole
animal
creation
the
causes
of
these
passions
are
likewise
much
the
same
in
beasts
as
in
us
making
a
just
allowance
for
our
superior
knowledge
and
understanding
thus
animals
have
little
or
no
sense
of
virtue
or
vice
they
quickly
lose
sight
of
the
relations
of
blood
and
are
incapable
of
that
of
right
and
property
for
which
reason
the
causes
of
their
pride
and
humility
must
lie
solely
in
the
body
and
can
never
be
placed
either
in
the
mind
or
external
objects
but
so
far
as
regards
the
body
the
same
qualities
cause
pride
in
the
animal
as
in
the
human
kind
and
it
is
on
beauty
strength
swiftness
or
some
other
useful
or
agreeable
quality
that
this
passion
is
always
founded
the
next
question
is
whether
since
those
passions
are
the
same
and
arise
from
the
same
causes
through
the
whole
creation
the
manner
in
which
the
causes
operate
be
also
the
same
according
to
all
rules
of
analogy
this
is
justly
to
be
expected
and
if
we
find
upon
trial
that
the
explication
of
these
phaenomena
which
we
make
use
of
in
one
species
will
not
apply
to
the
rest
we
may
presume
that
that
explication
however
specious
is
in
reality
without
foundation
in
order
to
decide
this
question
let
us
consider
that
there
is
evidently
the
same
relation
of
ideas
and
derived
from
the
same
causes
in
the
minds
of
animals
as
in
those
of
men
a
dog
that
has
hid
a
bone
often
forgets
the
place
but
when
brought
to
it
his
thought
passes
easily
to
what
he
formerly
concealed
by
means
of
the
contiguity
which
produces
a
relation
among
his
ideas
in
like
manner
when
he
has
been
heartily
beat
in
any
place
he
will
tremble
on
his
approach
to
it
even
though
he
discover
no
signs
of
any
present
danger
the
effects
of
resemblance
are
not
so
remarkable
but
as
that
relation
makes
a
considerable
ingredient
in
causation
of
which
all
animals
shew
so
evident
a
judgment
we
may
conclude
that
the
three
relations
of
resemblance
contiguity
and
causation
operate
in
the
same
manner
upon
beasts
as
upon
human
creatures
there
are
also
instances
of
the
relation
of
impressions
sufficient
to
convince
us
that
there
is
an
union
of
certain
affections
with
each
other
in
the
inferior
species
of
creatures
as
well
as
in
the
superior
and
that
their
minds
are
frequently
conveyed
through
a
series
of
connected
emotions
a
dog
when
elevated
with
joy
runs
naturally
into
love
and
kindness
whether
of
his
master
or
of
the
sex
in
like
manner
when
full
of
pain
and
sorrow
he
becomes
quarrelsome
and
illnatured
and
that
passion
which
at
first
was
grief
is
by
the
smallest
occasion
converted
into
anger
thus
all
the
internal
principles
that
are
necessary
in
us
to
produce
either
pride
or
humility
are
commcm
to
all
creaturn
and
since
the
causes
which
excite
these
passions
are
likewise
the
same
we
may
justly
conclude
that
these
causes
operate
after
the
same
manner
through
the
whole
animal
creation
my
hypothesis
is
so
simple
and
supposes
so
little
reflection
and
judgment
that
it
is
applicable
to
every
sensible
creature
which
must
not
only
be
allowed
to
be
a
convincing
proof
of
its
veracity
but
i
am
confident
will
be
found
an
objection
to
every
other
system
part
ii
of
love
and
hatred
sect
i
of
the
object
and
causes
of
love
and
hatred
it
is
altogether
impossible
to
give
any
definition
of
the
passions
of
love
and
hatred
and
that
because
they
produce
merely
a
simple
impression
without
any
mixture
or
composition
twould
be
as
unnecessary
to
attempt
any
description
of
them
drawn
from
their
nature
origin
causes
and
objects
and
that
both
because
these
are
the
subjects
of
our
present
enquiry
and
because
these
passions
of
themselves
are
sufficiently
known
from
our
common
feeling
and
experience
this
we
have
already
observed
concerning
pride
and
humility
and
here
repeat
it
concerning
love
and
hatred
and
indeed
there
is
so
great
a
resemblance
betwixt
these
two
sets
of
passions
that
we
shall
be
obliged
to
begin
with
a
kind
of
abridgment
of
our
reasonings
concerning
the
former
in
order
to
explain
the
latter
as
the
immediate
object
of
pride
and
humility
is
self
or
that
identical
person
of
whose
thoughts
actions
and
sensations
we
are
intimately
conscious
so
the
object
of
love
and
hatred
is
some
other
person
of
whose
thoughts
actions
and
sensations
we
are
not
conscious
this
is
sufficiently
evident
from
experience
our
love
and
hatred
are
always
directed
to
some
sensible
being
external
to
us
and
when
we
talk
of
it
is
not
in
a
proper
sense
nor
has
the
sensation
it
produces
any
thing
in
common
with
that
tender
emotion
which
is
excited
by
a
friend
or
mistress
it
is
the
same
case
with
hatred
we
may
be
mortified
by
our
own
faults
and
follies
but
never
feel
any
anger
or
hatred
except
from
the
injuries
of
others
but
though
the
object
of
love
and
hatred
be
always
some
other
person
it
is
plain
that
the
object
is
not
properly
speaking
the
cause
of
these
passions
or
alone
sufficient
to
excite
them
for
since
love
and
hatred
are
directly
contrary
in
their
sensation
and
have
the
same
object
in
common
if
that
object
were
also
their
cause
it
would
produce
these
opposite
passions
in
an
equal
degree
and
as
they
must
from
the
very
first
moment
destroy
each
other
none
of
them
would
ever
be
able
to
make
its
appearance
there
must
therefore
be
some
cause
different
from
the
object
if
we
consider
the
causes
of
love
and
hatred
we
shall
find
they
are
very
much
diversifyed
and
have
not
many
things
in
common
the
virtue
knowledge
wit
good
sense
good
humour
of
any
person
produce
love
and
esteem
as
the
opposite
qualities
hatred
and
contempt
the
same
passions
arise
from
bodily
accomplishments
such
as
beauty
force
swiftness
dexterity
and
from
their
contraries
as
likewise
from
the
external
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
family
possession
cloaths
nation
and
climate
there
is
not
one
of
these
objects
but
what
by
its
different
qualities
may
produce
love
and
esteem
or
hatred
and
contempt
from
the
view
of
these
causes
we
may
derive
a
new
distinction
betwixt
the
quality
that
operates
and
the
subject
on
which
it
is
placed
a
prince
that
is
possessed
of
a
stately
palace
commands
the
esteem
of
the
people
upon
that
account
and
that
first
by
the
beauty
of
the
palace
and
secondly
by
the
relation
of
property
which
connects
it
with
him
the
removal
of
either
of
these
destroys
the
passion
which
evidently
proves
that
the
cause
is
a
compounded
one
twould
be
tedious
to
trace
the
passions
of
love
and
hatred
through
all
the
observations
which
we
have
formed
concerning
pride
and
humility
and
which
are
equally
applicable
to
both
sets
of
passions
twill
be
sufficient
to
remark
in
general
that
the
object
of
love
and
hatred
is
evidently
some
thinking
person
and
that
the
sensation
of
the
former
passion
is
always
agreeable
and
of
the
latter
uneasy
we
may
also
suppose
with
some
shew
of
probability
that
the
cause
of
both
these
passions
is
always
related
to
a
thinking
being
and
that
the
cause
of
the
former
produce
a
separate
pleasure
and
of
the
latter
a
separate
uneasiness
one
of
these
suppositions
viz
that
the
cause
of
love
and
hatred
must
be
related
to
a
person
or
thinking
being
in
order
to
produce
these
passions
is
not
only
probable
but
too
evident
to
be
contested
virtue
and
vice
when
considered
in
the
abstract
beauty
and
deformity
when
placed
on
inanimate
objects
poverty
and
riches
when
belonging
to
a
third
person
excite
no
degree
of
love
or
hatred
esteem
or
contempt
towards
those
who
have
no
relation
to
them
a
person
looking
out
at
a
window
sees
me
in
the
street
and
beyond
me
a
beautiful
palace
with
which
i
have
no
concern
i
believe
none
will
pretend
that
this
person
will
pay
me
the
same
respect
as
if
i
were
owner
of
the
palace
it
is
not
so
evident
at
first
sight
that
a
relation
of
impressions
is
requisite
to
these
passions
and
that
because
in
the
transition
the
one
impression
is
so
much
confounded
with
the
other
that
they
become
in
a
manner
undistinguishable
but
as
in
pride
and
humility
we
have
easily
been
able
to
make
the
separation
and
to
prove
that
every
cause
of
these
passions
produces
a
separate
pain
or
pleasure
i
might
here
observe
the
same
method
with
the
same
success
in
examining
particularly
the
several
causes
of
love
and
hatred
but
as
i
hasten
a
full
and
decisive
proof
of
these
systems
i
delay
this
examination
for
a
moment
and
in
the
mean
time
shall
endeavour
to
convert
to
my
present
purpose
all
my
reaaonings
concerning
pride
and
humility
by
an
argument
that
is
founded
on
unquestionable
examination
there
are
few
persons
that
are
satisfyed
with
their
own
character
or
genius
or
fortune
who
are
nor
desirous
of
shewing
themselves
to
the
world
and
of
acquiring
the
love
and
approbation
of
mankind
now
it
is
evident
that
the
very
same
qualities
and
circumstances
which
are
the
causes
of
pride
or
are
also
the
causes
of
vanity
or
the
desire
of
reputation
and
that
we
always
put
to
view
those
particulars
with
which
in
ourselves
we
are
best
satisfyed
but
if
love
and
esteem
were
not
produced
by
the
same
qualities
as
pride
according
as
these
qualities
are
related
to
ourselves
or
others
this
method
of
proceeding
would
be
very
absurd
nor
coued
men
expect
a
correspondence
in
the
sentiments
of
every
other
person
with
those
themselves
have
entertained
it
is
true
few
can
form
exact
systems
of
the
passions
or
make
reflections
on
their
general
nature
and
resemblances
but
without
such
a
progress
in
philosophy
we
are
not
subject
to
many
mistakes
in
this
particular
but
are
sufficiently
guided
by
common
experience
as
well
as
by
a
kind
of
presentation
which
tells
us
what
will
operate
on
others
by
what
we
feel
immediately
in
ourselves
since
then
the
same
qualities
that
produce
pride
or
humility
cause
love
or
hatred
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
employed
to
prove
that
the
causes
of
the
former
passions
excite
a
pain
or
pleasure
independent
of
the
passion
will
be
applicable
with
equal
evidence
to
the
causes
of
the
latter
sect
ii
experiments
to
confirm
this
system
upon
duly
weighing
these
arguments
no
one
will
make
any
scruple
to
assent
to
that
condusion
i
draw
from
them
concerning
the
transition
along
related
impressions
and
ideas
especially
as
it
is
a
principle
in
itself
so
easy
and
natural
but
that
we
may
place
this
system
beyond
doubt
both
with
regard
to
love
and
hatred
pride
and
humility
it
will
be
proper
to
make
some
new
experiments
upon
all
these
passions
as
well
as
to
recal
a
few
of
these
observations
which
i
have
formerly
touched
upon
in
order
to
make
these
experiments
let
us
suppose
i
am
in
company
with
a
person
whom
i
formerly
regarded
without
any
sentiments
either
of
friendship
or
enmity
here
i
have
the
natural
and
ultimate
object
of
all
these
four
passions
placed
before
me
myself
am
the
proper
object
of
pride
or
humility
the
other
person
of
love
or
hatred
regard
now
with
attention
the
nature
of
these
passions
and
their
situation
with
respect
to
each
other
it
is
evident
here
are
four
affections
placed
as
it
were
in
a
square
or
regular
connexion
with
and
distance
from
each
other
the
passions
of
pride
and
humility
as
well
as
those
of
love
and
hatred
are
connected
together
by
the
identity
of
their
object
which
to
the
first
set
of
passions
is
self
to
the
second
some
other
person
these
two
lines
of
communication
or
connexion
form
two
opposite
sides
of
the
square
again
pride
and
love
are
agreeable
passions
hatred
and
humility
uneasy
this
similitude
of
sensation
betwixt
pride
and
love
and
that
betwixt
humility
and
hatred
form
a
new
connexion
and
may
be
considered
as
the
other
two
sides
of
the
square
upon
the
whole
pride
is
connected
with
humility
love
with
hatred
by
their
objects
or
ideas
pride
with
love
humility
with
hatred
by
their
sensations
or
impressions
i
say
then
that
nothing
can
produce
any
of
these
passions
without
bearing
it
a
double
relation
viz
of
ideas
to
the
object
of
the
passion
and
of
sensation
to
the
passion
itself
this
we
must
prove
by
our
experiments
first
experiment
to
proceed
with
the
greater
order
in
these
experiments
let
us
first
suppose
that
being
placed
in
the
situation
viz
in
company
with
some
other
person
there
is
an
object
presented
that
has
no
relation
either
of
impressions
or
ideas
to
any
of
these
passions
thus
suppose
we
regard
together
an
ordinary
stone
or
other
common
object
belonging
to
neither
of
us
and
causing
of
itself
no
emotion
or
independent
pain
and
pleasure
it
is
evident
such
an
object
will
produce
none
of
these
four
passions
let
us
try
it
upon
each
of
them
successively
let
us
apply
it
to
love
to
hatred
to
humility
to
pride
none
of
them
ever
arises
in
the
smallest
degree
imaginable
let
us
change
the
object
as
oft
as
we
please
provided
still
we
choose
one
that
has
neither
of
these
two
relations
let
us
repeat
the
experiment
in
all
the
dispositions
of
which
the
mind
is
susceptible
no
object
in
the
vast
variety
of
nature
will
in
any
disposition
produce
any
passion
without
these
relations
second
experiment
since
an
object
that
wants
both
these
relations
can
never
produce
any
passion
let
us
bestow
on
it
only
one
of
these
relations
and
see
what
will
follow
thus
suppose
i
regard
a
stone
or
any
common
object
that
belongs
either
to
me
or
my
companion
and
by
that
means
acquires
a
relation
of
ideas
to
the
object
of
the
passions
it
is
plain
that
to
consider
the
matter
a
priori
no
emotion
of
any
kind
can
reasonably
be
expected
for
besides
that
a
relation
of
ideas
operates
secretly
and
calmly
on
the
mind
it
bestows
an
equal
impulse
towards
the
opposite
passions
of
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
according
as
the
object
belongs
to
ourselves
or
others
which
opposition
of
the
passions
must
destroy
both
and
leave
the
mind
perfectly
free
from
any
affection
or
emotion
this
reasoning
a
priori
is
confirmed
by
experience
no
trivial
or
vulgar
object
that
causes
not
a
pain
or
pleasure
independent
of
the
passion
will
ever
by
its
property
or
other
relations
either
to
ourselves
or
others
be
able
to
produce
the
affections
of
pride
or
humility
love
or
hatred
third
experiment
it
is
evident
therefore
that
a
relation
of
ideas
is
not
able
alone
to
give
rise
to
these
affections
let
us
now
remove
this
relation
and
in
its
stead
place
a
relation
of
impressions
by
presenting
an
object
which
is
agreeable
or
disagreeable
but
has
no
relation
either
to
ourself
or
companion
and
let
us
observe
the
consequences
to
consider
the
matter
first
a
priori
as
in
the
preceding
experiment
we
may
conclude
that
the
object
will
have
a
small
but
an
uncertain
connexion
with
these
passions
for
besides
that
this
relation
is
not
a
cold
and
imperceptible
one
it
has
not
the
inconvenience
of
the
relation
of
ideas
nor
directs
us
with
equal
force
to
two
contrary
passions
which
by
their
opposition
destroy
each
other
but
if
we
consider
on
the
other
hand
that
this
transition
from
the
sensation
to
the
affection
is
not
forwarded
by
any
principle
that
produces
a
transition
of
ideas
but
on
the
contrary
that
though
the
one
impression
be
easily
transfused
into
the
other
yet
the
change
of
objects
is
supposed
contrary
to
all
the
principles
that
cause
a
transition
of
that
kind
we
may
from
thence
infer
that
nothing
will
ever
be
a
steady
or
durable
cause
of
any
passion
that
is
connected
with
the
passion
merely
by
a
relation
of
impressions
what
our
reason
would
conclude
from
analogy
after
balancing
these
arguments
would
be
that
an
object
which
produces
pleasure
or
uneasiness
but
has
no
manner
of
connexion
either
with
ourselves
or
others
may
give
such
a
turn
to
the
disposition
as
that
may
naturally
fall
into
pride
or
love
humility
or
hatred
and
search
for
other
objects
upon
which
by
a
double
relation
it
can
found
these
affections
but
that
an
object
which
has
only
one
of
these
relations
though
the
most
advantageous
one
can
never
give
rise
to
any
constant
and
established
passion
most
fortunately
all
this
reasoning
is
found
to
be
exactly
conformable
to
experience
and
the
phaenomena
of
the
passions
suppose
i
were
travelling
with
a
companion
through
a
country
to
which
we
are
both
utter
strangers
it
is
evident
that
if
the
prospects
be
beautiful
the
roads
agreeable
and
the
inns
commodious
this
may
put
me
into
good
humour
both
with
myself
and
but
as
we
suppose
that
this
country
has
no
relation
either
to
myself
or
friend
it
can
never
be
the
immediate
cause
of
pride
or
love
and
therefore
if
i
found
not
the
passion
on
some
other
object
that
bears
either
of
us
a
closer
relation
my
emotions
are
rather
to
be
considerd
as
the
overflowings
of
an
elevate
or
humane
disposition
than
as
an
established
passion
the
case
is
the
same
where
the
object
produces
uneasiness
fourth
experiment
having
found
that
neither
an
object
without
any
relation
of
ideas
or
impressions
nor
an
object
that
has
only
one
relation
can
ever
cause
pride
or
humility
love
or
hatred
reason
alone
may
convince
us
without
any
farther
experiment
that
whatever
has
a
double
relation
must
necessarily
excite
these
passions
since
it
is
evident
they
must
have
some
cause
but
to
leave
as
little
room
for
doubt
as
possible
let
us
renew
our
experiments
and
see
whether
the
event
in
this
case
answers
our
expectation
i
choose
an
object
such
as
virtue
that
causes
a
separate
satisfaction
on
this
object
i
bestow
a
relation
to
self
and
find
that
from
this
disposition
of
affairs
there
immediately
arises
a
passion
but
what
passion
that
very
one
of
pride
to
which
this
object
bears
a
double
relation
its
idea
is
related
to
that
of
self
the
object
of
the
passion
the
sensation
it
causes
resembles
the
sensation
of
the
passion
that
i
may
be
sure
i
am
not
mistaken
in
this
experiment
i
remove
first
one
relation
then
another
and
find
that
each
removal
destroys
the
passion
and
leaves
the
object
perfectly
indifferent
but
i
am
not
content
with
this
i
make
a
still
farther
trial
and
instead
of
removing
the
relation
i
only
change
it
for
one
of
a
different
kind
i
suppose
the
virtue
to
belong
to
my
companion
not
to
myself
and
observe
what
follows
from
this
alteration
i
immediately
perceive
the
affections
wheel
to
about
and
leaving
pride
where
there
is
only
one
relation
viz
of
impressions
fall
to
the
side
of
love
where
they
are
attracted
by
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
by
repeating
the
same
experiment
in
changing
anew
the
relation
of
ideas
i
bring
the
affections
back
to
pride
and
by
a
new
repetition
i
again
place
them
at
love
or
kindness
being
fully
convinced
of
the
influence
of
this
relation
i
try
the
effects
of
the
other
and
by
changing
virtue
for
vice
convert
the
pleasant
impression
which
arises
from
the
former
into
the
disagreeable
one
which
proceeds
from
the
latter
the
effect
still
answers
expectation
vice
when
placed
on
another
excites
by
means
of
its
double
relations
the
passion
of
hatred
instead
of
love
which
for
the
same
reason
arises
from
virtue
to
continue
the
experiment
i
change
anew
the
relation
of
ideas
and
suppose
the
vice
to
belong
to
myself
what
follows
what
is
usual
a
subsequent
change
of
the
passion
from
hatred
to
humility
this
humility
i
convert
into
pride
by
a
new
change
of
the
impression
and
find
after
all
that
i
have
compleated
the
round
and
have
by
these
changes
brought
back
the
passion
to
that
very
situation
in
which
i
first
found
it
but
to
make
the
matter
still
more
certain
i
alter
the
object
and
instead
of
vice
and
virtue
make
the
trial
upon
beauty
and
deformity
riches
and
poverty
power
and
servitude
each
of
these
objects
runs
the
circle
of
the
passions
in
the
same
manner
by
a
change
of
their
relations
and
in
whatever
order
we
proceed
whether
through
pride
love
hatred
humility
or
through
humility
hatred
love
pride
the
experiment
is
not
in
the
least
diversifyed
esteem
and
contempt
indeed
arise
on
some
occasions
instead
of
love
and
hatred
but
these
are
at
the
bottom
the
same
passions
only
diversifyed
by
some
causes
which
we
shall
explain
afterwards
fifth
experiment
to
give
greater
authority
to
these
experiments
let
us
change
the
situation
of
affairs
as
much
as
possible
and
place
the
passions
and
objects
in
all
the
different
positions
of
which
they
are
susceptible
let
us
suppose
beside
the
relations
that
the
person
along
with
whom
i
make
all
these
experiments
is
closely
connected
with
me
either
by
blood
or
friendship
he
is
we
shall
suppose
my
son
or
brother
or
is
united
to
me
by
a
long
and
familiar
acquaintance
let
us
next
suppose
that
the
cause
of
the
passion
acquires
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
to
this
person
and
let
us
see
what
the
effects
are
of
all
these
complicated
attractions
and
relations
before
we
consider
what
they
are
in
fact
let
us
determine
what
they
ought
to
be
conformable
to
my
hypothesis
it
is
plain
that
according
as
the
impression
is
either
pleasant
or
uneasy
the
passion
of
love
or
hatred
must
arise
towards
the
person
who
is
thus
connected
to
the
cause
of
the
impression
by
these
double
relations
which
i
have
all
along
required
the
virtue
of
a
brother
must
make
me
love
him
as
his
vice
or
infamy
must
excite
the
contrary
passion
but
to
judge
only
from
the
situation
of
affairs
i
should
not
expect
that
the
affections
would
rest
there
and
never
transfuse
themselves
into
any
other
impression
as
there
is
here
a
person
who
by
means
of
a
double
relation
is
the
object
of
my
passion
the
very
same
reasoning
leads
me
to
think
the
passion
will
be
carryed
farther
the
person
has
a
relation
of
ideas
to
myself
according
to
the
supposition
the
passion
of
which
he
is
the
object
by
being
either
agreeable
or
uneasy
has
a
relation
of
impressions
to
pride
or
humility
it
is
evident
then
that
one
of
these
passions
must
arise
from
the
love
or
hatred
this
is
the
reasoning
i
form
in
conformity
to
my
hypothesis
and
am
pleased
to
find
upon
trial
that
every
thing
answers
exactly
to
my
expectation
the
virtue
or
vice
of
a
son
or
brother
not
only
excites
love
or
hatred
but
by
a
new
transition
from
similar
causes
gives
rise
to
pride
or
humility
nothing
causes
greater
vanity
than
any
shining
quality
in
our
relations
as
nothing
mortifies
us
more
than
their
vice
or
infamy
this
exact
conformity
of
experience
to
our
reasoning
is
a
convincing
proof
of
the
solidity
of
that
hypothesis
upon
which
we
reason
sixth
experiment
this
evidence
will
be
still
augmented
if
we
reverse
the
experiment
and
preserving
still
the
same
relations
begin
only
with
a
different
passion
suppose
that
instead
of
the
virtue
or
vice
of
a
son
or
brother
which
causes
first
love
or
hatred
and
afterwards
pride
or
humility
we
place
these
good
or
bad
qualities
on
ourselves
without
any
immediate
connexion
with
the
person
who
is
related
to
us
experience
shews
us
that
by
this
change
of
situation
the
whole
chain
is
broke
and
that
the
mind
is
not
conveyed
from
one
passion
to
another
as
in
the
preceding
instance
we
never
love
or
hate
a
son
or
brother
for
the
virtue
or
vice
we
discern
in
ourselves
though
it
is
evident
the
same
qualities
in
him
give
us
a
very
sensible
pride
or
humility
the
transition
from
pride
or
humility
to
love
or
hatred
is
not
so
natural
as
from
love
or
hatred
to
pride
or
humility
this
may
at
first
sight
be
esteemed
contrary
to
my
hypothesis
since
the
relations
of
impressions
and
ideas
are
in
both
cases
precisely
the
same
pride
and
humility
are
impressions
related
to
love
and
hatred
myself
am
related
to
the
person
it
should
therefore
be
expected
that
like
causes
must
produce
like
effects
and
a
perfect
transition
arise
from
the
double
relation
as
in
all
other
cases
this
difficulty
we
may
easily
solve
by
the
following
reflections
it
is
evident
that
as
we
are
at
all
times
intimately
conscious
of
ourselves
our
sentiments
and
passions
their
ideas
must
strike
upon
us
with
greater
vivacity
than
the
ideas
of
the
sentiments
and
passions
of
any
other
person
but
every
thing
that
strikes
upon
us
with
vivacity
and
appears
in
a
full
and
strong
light
forces
itself
in
a
manner
into
our
consideration
and
becomes
present
to
the
mind
on
the
smallest
hint
and
most
trivial
relation
for
the
same
reason
when
it
is
once
present
it
engages
the
attention
and
keeps
it
from
wandering
to
other
objects
however
strong
may
be
their
relation
to
our
first
object
the
imagination
passes
easily
from
obscure
to
lively
ideas
but
with
difficulty
from
lively
to
obscure
in
the
one
case
the
relation
is
aided
by
another
principle
in
the
other
case
it
is
opposed
by
it
now
i
have
observed
that
those
two
faculties
of
the
mind
the
imagination
and
passions
assist
each
other
in
their
operations
when
their
propensities
are
similar
and
when
they
act
upon
the
same
object
the
mind
has
always
a
propensity
to
pass
from
a
passion
to
any
other
related
to
it
and
this
propensity
is
forwarded
when
the
object
of
the
one
passion
is
related
to
that
of
the
other
the
two
impulses
concur
with
each
other
and
render
the
whole
transition
more
smooth
and
easy
but
if
it
should
happen
that
while
the
relation
of
ideas
strictly
speaking
continues
the
same
its
influence
in
causing
a
transition
of
the
imagination
should
no
longer
take
place
it
is
evident
its
influence
on
the
passions
must
also
cease
as
being
dependent
entirely
on
that
transition
this
is
the
reason
why
pride
or
humility
is
not
transfused
into
love
or
hatred
with
the
same
ease
that
the
latter
passions
are
changed
into
the
former
if
a
person
be
my
brother
i
am
his
likewise
but
though
the
relations
be
reciprocal
they
have
very
different
effects
on
the
imagination
the
passage
is
smooth
and
open
from
the
consideration
of
any
person
related
to
us
to
that
of
ourself
of
whom
we
are
every
moment
conscious
but
when
the
affections
are
once
directed
to
ourself
the
fancy
passes
not
with
the
same
facility
from
that
object
to
any
other
person
how
closely
so
ever
connected
with
us
this
easy
or
difficult
transition
of
the
imagination
operates
upon
the
passions
and
facilitates
or
retards
their
transition
which
is
a
clear
proof
that
these
two
faculties
of
the
passions
and
imagination
are
connected
together
and
that
the
relations
of
ideas
have
an
influence
upon
the
affections
besides
innumerable
experiments
that
prove
this
we
here
find
that
even
when
the
relation
remains
if
by
any
particular
circumstance
its
usual
effect
upon
the
fancy
in
producing
an
association
or
transition
of
ideas
is
prevented
its
usual
effect
upon
the
passions
in
conveying
us
from
one
to
another
is
in
like
manner
prevented
some
may
perhaps
find
a
contradiction
betwixt
this
phaenomenon
and
that
of
sympathy
where
the
mind
passes
easily
from
the
idea
of
ourselves
to
that
of
any
other
object
related
to
us
but
this
difficulty
will
vanish
if
we
consider
that
in
sympathy
our
own
person
is
not
the
object
of
any
passion
nor
is
there
any
thing
that
fixes
our
attention
on
ourselves
as
in
the
present
case
where
we
are
supposed
to
be
actuated
with
pride
or
humility
ourself
independent
of
the
perception
of
every
other
object
is
in
reality
nothing
for
which
reason
we
must
turn
our
view
to
external
objects
and
it
is
natural
for
us
to
consider
with
most
attention
such
as
lie
contiguous
to
us
or
resemble
us
but
when
self
is
the
object
of
a
passion
it
is
not
natural
to
quit
the
consideration
of
it
till
the
passion
be
exhausted
in
which
case
the
double
relations
of
impressions
and
ideas
can
no
longer
operate
seventh
experiment
to
put
this
whole
reasoning
to
a
farther
trial
let
us
make
a
new
experiment
and
as
we
have
already
seen
the
effects
of
related
passions
and
ideas
let
us
here
suppose
an
identity
of
passions
along
with
a
relation
of
ideas
and
let
us
consider
the
effects
of
this
new
situation
it
is
evident
a
transition
of
the
passions
from
the
one
object
to
the
other
is
here
in
all
reason
to
be
expected
since
the
relation
of
ideas
is
supposed
still
to
continue
and
identity
of
impressions
must
produce
a
stronger
connexion
than
the
most
perfect
resemblance
that
can
be
imagined
if
a
double
relation
therefore
of
impressions
and
ideas
is
able
to
produce
a
transition
from
one
to
the
other
much
more
an
identity
of
impressions
with
a
relation
of
ideas
accordingly
we
find
that
when
we
either
love
or
hate
any
person
the
passions
seldom
continue
within
their
first
bounds
but
extend
themselves
towards
all
the
contiguous
objects
and
comprehend
the
friends
and
relations
of
him
we
love
or
hate
nothing
is
more
natural
than
to
bear
a
kindness
to
one
brother
on
account
of
our
friendship
for
another
without
any
farther
examination
of
his
character
a
quarrel
with
one
person
gives
us
a
hatred
for
the
whole
family
though
entirely
innocent
of
that
which
displeases
us
instances
of
this
kind
are
every
where
to
be
met
with
there
is
only
one
difficulty
in
this
experiment
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
account
for
before
we
proceed
any
farther
it
is
evident
that
though
all
passions
pass
easily
from
one
object
to
another
related
to
it
yet
this
transition
is
made
with
greater
facility
where
the
more
considerable
object
is
first
presented
and
the
lesser
follows
it
than
where
this
order
is
reversed
and
the
lesser
takes
the
precedence
thus
it
is
more
natural
for
us
to
love
the
son
upon
account
of
the
father
than
the
father
upon
account
of
the
son
the
servant
for
the
master
than
the
master
for
the
servant
the
subject
for
the
prince
than
the
prince
for
the
subject
in
like
manner
we
more
readily
contract
a
hatred
against
a
whole
family
where
our
first
quarrel
is
with
the
head
of
it
than
where
we
are
displeased
with
a
son
or
servant
or
some
inferior
member
in
short
our
passions
like
other
objects
descend
with
greater
facility
than
they
ascend
that
we
may
comprehend
wherein
consists
the
difficulty
of
explaining
this
phaenomenon
we
must
consider
that
the
very
same
reason
which
determines
the
imagination
to
pass
from
remote
to
contiguous
objects
with
more
facility
than
from
contiguous
to
remote
causes
it
likewise
to
change
with
more
ease
the
less
for
the
greater
than
the
greater
for
the
less
whatever
has
the
greatest
influence
is
most
taken
notice
of
and
whatever
is
most
taken
notice
of
presents
itself
most
readily
to
the
imagination
we
are
more
apt
to
in
any
subject
what
is
trivial
than
what
appears
of
considerable
moment
but
especially
if
the
latter
takes
the
precedence
and
first
engages
our
attention
thus
if
any
accident
makes
us
consider
the
satellites
of
jupiter
our
fancy
is
naturally
determined
to
form
the
idea
of
that
planet
but
if
we
first
reflect
on
the
principal
planet
it
is
more
natural
for
us
to
overlook
its
attendants
the
mention
of
the
provinces
of
any
empire
conveys
our
thought
to
the
seat
of
the
empire
but
the
fancy
returns
not
with
the
same
facility
to
the
consideration
of
the
provinces
the
idea
of
the
servant
makes
us
think
of
the
master
that
of
the
subject
carries
our
view
to
the
prince
but
the
same
relation
has
not
an
equal
influence
in
conveying
us
back
again
and
on
this
is
founded
that
reproach
of
cornelia
to
her
sons
that
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
she
should
be
more
known
by
the
title
of
the
daughter
of
scipio
than
by
that
of
the
mother
of
the
gracchi
this
was
in
other
words
exhorting
them
to
render
themselves
as
illustrious
and
famous
as
their
grandfather
otherwise
the
imagination
of
the
people
passing
from
her
who
was
intermediate
and
placed
in
an
equal
relation
to
both
would
always
leave
them
and
denominate
her
by
what
was
more
considerable
and
of
greater
moment
on
the
same
principle
is
founded
that
common
custom
of
making
wives
bear
the
name
of
their
husbands
rather
than
husbands
that
of
their
wives
as
also
the
ceremony
of
giving
the
precedency
to
those
whom
we
honour
and
respect
we
might
find
many
other
instances
to
confirm
this
principle
were
it
not
already
sufficiently
evident
now
since
the
fancy
finds
the
same
facility
in
passing
from
the
lesser
to
the
greater
as
from
remote
to
contiguous
why
does
not
this
easy
transition
of
ideas
assist
the
transition
of
passions
in
the
former
case
as
well
as
in
the
latter
the
virtues
of
a
friend
or
brother
produce
first
love
and
then
pride
because
in
that
case
the
imagination
passes
from
remote
to
contiguous
according
to
its
propensity
our
own
virtues
produce
not
first
pride
and
then
love
to
a
friend
or
brother
because
the
passage
in
that
case
would
be
from
contiguous
to
remote
contrary
to
its
propensity
but
the
love
or
hatred
of
an
inferior
causes
not
readily
any
passion
to
the
superior
though
that
be
the
natural
propensity
of
the
imagination
while
the
love
or
hatred
of
a
superior
causes
a
passion
to
the
inferior
contrary
to
its
propensity
in
short
the
same
facility
of
transition
operates
not
in
the
same
manner
upon
superior
and
inferior
as
upon
contiguous
and
remote
these
two
phaenomena
appear
contradictory
and
require
some
attention
to
be
reconciled
as
the
transition
of
ideas
is
here
made
contrary
to
the
natural
propensity
of
the
imagination
that
faculty
must
be
overpowered
by
some
stronger
principle
of
another
kind
and
as
there
is
nothing
ever
present
to
the
mind
but
impressions
and
ideas
this
principle
must
necessarily
lie
in
the
impressions
now
it
has
been
observed
that
impressions
or
passions
are
connected
only
by
their
resemblance
and
that
where
any
two
passions
place
the
mind
in
the
same
or
in
similar
dispositions
it
very
naturally
passes
from
the
one
to
the
other
as
on
the
contrary
a
repugnance
in
the
dispositions
produces
a
difficulty
in
the
transition
of
the
passions
but
it
is
observable
that
this
repugnance
may
arise
from
a
difference
of
degree
as
well
as
of
kind
nor
do
we
experience
a
greater
difficulty
in
passing
suddenly
from
a
small
degree
of
love
to
a
small
degree
of
hatred
than
from
a
small
to
a
great
degree
of
either
of
these
affections
a
man
when
calm
or
only
moderately
agitated
is
so
different
in
every
respect
from
himself
when
disturbed
with
a
violent
passion
that
no
two
persons
can
be
more
unlike
nor
is
it
easy
to
pass
from
the
one
extreme
to
the
other
without
a
considerable
interval
betwixt
them
the
difficulty
is
not
less
if
it
be
not
rather
greater
in
passing
from
the
strong
passion
to
the
weak
than
in
passing
from
the
weak
to
the
strong
provided
the
one
passion
upon
its
appearance
destroys
the
other
and
they
do
not
both
of
them
exist
at
once
but
the
case
is
entirely
altered
when
the
passions
unite
together
and
actuate
the
mind
at
the
same
time
a
weak
passion
when
added
to
a
strong
makes
not
so
considerable
a
change
in
the
disposition
as
a
strong
when
added
to
a
weak
for
which
reason
there
is
a
closer
connexion
betwixt
the
great
degree
and
the
small
than
betwixt
the
small
degree
and
the
great
the
degree
of
any
passion
depends
upon
the
nature
of
its
object
and
an
affection
directed
to
a
person
who
is
considerable
in
our
eyes
fills
and
possesses
the
mind
much
more
than
one
which
has
for
its
object
a
person
we
esteem
of
less
consequence
here
then
the
contradiction
betwixt
the
propensities
of
the
imagination
and
passion
displays
itself
when
we
turn
our
thought
to
a
great
and
a
small
object
the
imagination
finds
more
facility
in
passing
from
the
small
to
the
great
than
from
the
great
to
the
small
but
the
affections
find
a
greater
difficulty
and
as
the
affections
are
a
more
powerful
principle
than
the
imagination
no
wonder
they
prevail
over
it
and
draw
the
mind
to
their
side
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
passing
from
the
idea
of
great
to
that
of
little
a
passion
directed
to
the
former
produces
always
a
similar
passion
towards
the
latter
when
the
great
and
little
are
related
together
the
idea
of
the
servant
conveys
our
thought
most
readily
to
the
master
but
the
hatred
or
love
of
the
master
produces
with
greater
facility
anger
or
to
the
servant
the
strongest
passion
in
this
case
takes
the
precedence
and
the
addition
of
the
weaker
making
no
considerable
change
on
the
disposition
the
passage
is
by
that
means
rendered
more
easy
and
natural
betwixt
them
as
in
the
foregoing
experiment
we
found
that
a
relation
of
ideas
which
by
any
particular
circumstance
ceases
to
produce
its
usual
effect
of
facilitating
the
transition
of
ideas
ceases
likewise
to
operate
on
the
passions
so
in
the
present
experiment
we
find
the
same
property
of
the
impressions
two
different
degrees
of
the
same
passion
are
surely
related
together
but
if
the
smaller
be
first
present
it
has
little
or
no
tendency
to
introduce
the
greater
and
that
because
the
addition
of
the
great
to
the
little
produces
a
more
sensible
alteration
on
the
temper
than
the
addition
of
the
little
to
the
great
these
phaenomena
when
duly
weighed
will
be
found
convincing
proofs
of
this
hypothesis
and
these
proofs
will
be
confirmed
if
we
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
mind
here
reconciles
the
contradiction
i
have
observed
betwixt
the
passions
and
the
imagination
the
fancy
passes
with
more
facility
from
the
less
to
the
greater
than
from
the
greater
to
the
less
but
on
the
contrary
a
violent
passion
produces
more
easily
a
feeble
than
that
does
a
violent
in
this
opposition
the
passion
in
the
end
prevails
over
the
imagination
but
it
is
commonly
by
complying
with
it
and
by
seeking
another
quality
which
may
that
principle
from
whence
the
opposition
arises
when
we
love
the
father
or
master
of
a
family
we
little
think
of
his
children
or
servants
but
when
these
are
present
with
us
or
when
it
lies
any
ways
in
our
power
to
serve
them
the
nearness
and
contiguity
in
this
case
encreases
their
magnitude
or
at
least
removes
that
opposition
which
the
fancy
makes
to
the
transition
of
the
affections
if
the
imagination
finds
a
difficulty
in
passing
from
greater
to
less
it
finds
an
equal
facility
in
passing
from
remote
to
contiguous
which
brings
the
matter
to
an
equality
and
leaves
the
way
open
from
the
one
passion
to
the
other
eighth
experiment
i
have
observed
that
the
transition
from
love
or
hatred
to
pride
or
humility
is
more
easy
than
from
pride
or
humility
to
love
or
hatred
and
that
the
difficulty
which
the
imagination
finds
in
passing
from
contiguous
to
remote
is
the
cause
why
we
scarce
have
any
instance
of
the
latter
transition
of
the
affections
i
must
however
make
one
exception
viz
when
the
very
cause
of
the
pride
and
humility
is
placed
in
some
other
person
for
in
that
case
the
imagination
is
necessitated
to
consider
the
person
nor
can
it
possibly
confine
its
view
to
ourselves
thus
nothing
more
readily
produces
kindness
and
affection
to
any
person
than
his
approbation
of
our
conduct
and
character
as
on
the
other
hand
nothing
inspires
us
with
a
stronger
hatred
than
his
blame
or
contempt
here
it
is
evident
that
the
original
passion
is
pride
or
humility
whose
object
is
self
and
that
this
passion
is
transfused
into
love
or
hatred
whose
object
is
some
other
person
notwithstanding
the
rule
i
have
already
established
that
the
imagination
passes
with
difficulty
from
contiguous
to
remote
but
the
transition
in
this
case
is
not
made
merely
on
account
of
the
relation
betwixt
ourselves
and
the
person
but
because
that
very
person
is
the
real
cause
of
our
first
passion
and
of
consequence
is
intimately
connected
with
it
it
is
his
approbation
that
produces
pride
and
disapprobation
humility
no
wonder
then
the
imagination
returns
back
again
attended
with
the
related
passions
of
love
and
hatred
this
is
not
a
contradiction
but
an
exception
to
the
rule
and
an
exception
that
arises
from
the
same
reason
with
the
rule
itself
such
an
exception
as
this
is
therefore
rather
a
confirmation
of
the
rule
and
indeed
if
we
consider
all
the
eight
experiments
i
have
explained
we
shall
find
that
the
same
principle
appears
in
all
of
them
and
that
it
is
by
means
of
a
transition
arising
from
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
are
produced
an
object
without
first
experiment
a
relation
or
second
and
third
experiments
with
but
one
never
produces
either
of
these
passions
and
it
is
fourth
experiment
found
that
the
passion
always
varies
in
conformity
to
the
relation
nay
we
may
observe
that
where
the
relation
by
any
particular
circumstance
has
not
its
usual
effect
of
producing
a
transition
either
of
sixth
experiment
ideas
or
of
impressions
it
ceases
to
operate
upon
the
passions
and
gives
rise
neither
to
pride
nor
love
humility
nor
hatred
this
rule
we
find
still
to
hold
good
seventh
and
eighth
experiments
even
under
the
appearance
of
its
contrary
and
as
relation
is
frequently
experienced
to
have
no
effect
which
upon
examination
is
found
to
proceed
from
some
particular
circumstance
that
prevents
the
transition
so
even
in
instances
where
that
circumstance
though
present
prevents
not
the
transition
it
is
found
to
arise
from
some
other
circumstance
which
it
thus
not
only
the
variations
resolve
themselves
into
the
general
principle
but
even
the
variations
of
these
variations
sect
iii
difficulties
solved
after
so
many
and
such
undeniable
proofs
drawn
from
daily
experience
and
observation
it
may
seem
superfluous
to
enter
into
a
particular
examination
of
all
the
causes
of
love
and
hatred
i
shall
therefore
employ
the
sequel
of
this
part
first
in
removing
some
difficulties
concerning
particular
causes
of
these
passions
secondly
in
examining
the
compound
affections
which
arise
from
the
mixture
of
love
and
hatred
with
other
emotions
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
any
person
acquires
our
kindness
or
is
exposed
to
our
in
proportion
to
the
pleasure
or
uneasiness
we
receive
from
him
and
that
the
passions
keep
pace
exactly
with
the
sensations
in
all
their
changes
and
variations
whoever
can
find
the
means
either
by
his
services
his
beauty
or
his
flattery
to
render
himself
useful
or
agreeable
to
us
is
sure
of
our
affections
as
on
the
other
hand
whoever
harms
or
displeases
us
never
fails
to
excite
our
anger
or
hatred
when
our
own
nation
is
at
war
with
any
other
we
detest
them
under
the
character
of
cruel
perfidious
unjust
and
violent
but
always
esteem
ourselves
and
allies
equitable
moderate
and
merciful
if
the
general
of
our
enemies
be
successful
it
is
with
difficulty
we
allow
him
the
figure
and
character
of
a
man
he
is
a
sorcerer
he
has
a
communication
with
daemons
as
is
reported
of
oliver
cromwell
and
the
duke
of
luxembourg
he
is
and
takes
a
pleasure
in
death
and
destruction
but
if
the
success
be
on
our
side
our
commander
has
all
the
opposite
good
qualities
and
is
a
pattern
of
virtue
as
well
as
of
courage
and
conduct
his
treachery
we
call
policy
his
cruelty
is
an
evil
inseparable
from
war
in
short
every
one
of
his
faults
we
either
endeavour
to
extenuate
or
dignify
it
with
the
name
of
that
virtue
which
approaches
it
it
is
evident
the
same
method
of
thinking
runs
through
common
life
there
are
some
who
add
another
condition
and
require
not
only
that
the
pain
and
pleasure
arise
from
the
person
but
likewise
that
it
arise
knowingly
and
with
a
particular
design
and
intention
a
man
who
wounds
and
harms
us
by
accident
becomes
not
our
enemy
upon
that
account
nor
do
we
think
ourselves
bound
by
any
ties
of
gratitude
to
one
who
does
us
any
service
after
the
same
manner
by
the
intention
we
judge
of
the
actions
and
according
as
that
is
good
or
bad
they
become
causes
of
love
or
hatred
but
here
we
must
make
a
distinction
if
that
quality
in
another
which
pleases
or
displeases
be
constant
and
inherent
in
his
person
and
character
it
will
cause
love
or
hatred
independent
of
the
intention
but
otherwise
a
knowledge
and
design
is
requisite
in
order
to
give
rise
to
these
passions
one
that
is
disagreeable
by
his
deformity
or
folly
is
the
object
of
our
aversion
though
nothing
be
more
certain
than
that
he
has
not
the
least
intention
of
displeasing
us
by
these
qualities
but
if
the
uneasiness
proceed
not
from
a
quality
but
an
action
which
is
produced
and
annihilated
in
a
moment
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
produce
some
relation
and
connect
this
action
sufficiently
with
the
person
that
it
be
derived
from
a
particular
and
design
it
is
not
enough
that
the
action
arise
from
the
person
and
have
him
for
its
immediate
cause
and
author
this
relation
alone
is
too
feeble
and
inconstant
to
be
a
foundation
for
these
passions
it
reaches
not
the
sensible
and
thinking
part
and
neither
proceeds
from
any
thing
durable
in
him
nor
leaves
any
thing
behind
it
but
passes
in
a
moment
and
is
as
if
it
had
never
been
on
the
other
hand
an
intention
shews
certain
qualities
which
remaining
after
the
action
is
performed
connect
it
with
the
person
and
facilitate
the
transition
of
ideas
from
one
to
the
other
we
can
never
think
of
him
without
reflecting
on
these
qualities
unless
repentance
and
a
change
of
life
have
produced
an
alteration
in
that
respect
in
which
case
the
passion
is
likewise
altered
this
therefore
is
one
reason
why
an
intention
is
requisite
to
excite
either
love
or
hatred
but
we
must
farther
consider
that
an
intention
besides
its
strengthening
the
relation
of
ideas
is
often
necessary
to
produce
a
relation
of
impressions
and
give
rise
to
pleasure
and
uneasiness
for
it
is
observable
that
the
principal
part
of
an
injury
is
the
contempt
and
hatred
which
it
shews
in
the
person
that
injures
us
and
without
that
the
mere
harm
gives
us
a
less
sensible
uneasiness
in
like
manner
a
good
office
is
agreeable
chiefly
because
it
flatters
our
vanity
and
is
a
proof
of
the
kindness
and
esteem
of
the
person
who
performs
it
the
removal
of
the
intention
removes
the
mortification
in
the
one
case
and
vanity
in
the
other
and
must
of
course
cause
a
remarkable
diminution
in
the
passions
of
love
and
hatred
i
grant
that
these
effects
of
the
removal
of
design
in
diminishing
the
relations
of
impressions
and
ideas
are
not
entire
nor
able
to
remove
every
degree
of
these
relations
but
then
i
ask
if
the
removal
of
design
be
able
entirely
to
remove
the
passion
of
love
and
hatred
experience
i
am
sure
informs
us
of
the
contrary
nor
is
there
any
thing
more
certain
than
that
men
often
fall
into
a
violent
anger
for
injuries
which
they
themselves
must
own
to
be
entirely
involuntary
and
accidental
this
emotion
indeed
can
not
be
of
long
continuance
but
still
is
sufficient
to
shew
that
there
is
a
natural
connexion
betwixt
uneasiness
and
anger
and
that
the
relation
of
impressions
will
operate
upon
a
very
small
relation
of
ideas
but
when
the
violence
of
the
impression
is
once
a
little
abated
the
defect
of
the
relation
begins
to
be
better
felt
and
as
the
character
of
a
person
is
no
wise
interested
in
such
injuries
as
are
casual
and
involuntary
it
seldom
happens
that
on
their
account
we
entertain
a
lasting
enmity
to
illustrate
this
doctrine
by
a
parallel
instance
we
may
observe
that
not
only
the
uneasiness
which
proceeds
from
another
by
accident
has
but
little
force
to
excite
our
passion
but
also
that
which
arises
from
an
acknowledged
necessity
and
duty
one
that
has
a
real
design
of
harming
us
proceeding
not
from
hatred
and
but
from
justice
and
equity
draws
not
upon
him
our
anger
if
we
be
in
any
degree
reasonable
notwithstanding
he
is
both
the
cause
and
the
knowing
cause
of
our
sufferings
let
us
examine
a
little
this
phaenomenon
it
is
evident
in
the
first
place
that
this
circumstance
is
not
decisive
and
though
it
may
be
able
to
diminish
the
passions
it
is
seldom
it
can
entirely
remove
them
how
few
criminals
are
there
who
have
no
to
the
person
that
accuses
them
or
to
the
judge
that
condemns
them
even
though
they
be
conscious
of
their
own
deserts
in
like
manner
our
antagonist
in
a
and
our
competitor
for
any
office
are
commonly
regarded
as
our
enemies
though
we
must
acknowledge
if
we
would
but
reflect
a
moment
that
their
motive
is
entirely
as
justifiable
as
our
own
besides
we
may
consider
that
when
we
receive
harm
from
any
person
we
are
apt
to
imagine
him
criminal
and
it
is
with
extreme
difficulty
we
allow
of
his
justice
and
innocence
this
is
a
clear
proof
that
independent
of
the
opinion
of
iniquity
any
harm
or
uneasiness
has
a
natural
tendency
to
excite
our
hatred
and
that
afterwards
we
seek
for
reasons
upon
which
we
may
justify
and
establish
the
passion
here
the
idea
of
injury
produces
not
the
passion
but
arises
from
it
nor
is
it
any
wonder
that
passion
should
produce
the
opinion
of
injury
since
otherwise
it
must
suffer
a
considerable
diminution
which
all
the
passions
avoid
as
much
as
possible
the
removal
of
injury
may
remove
the
anger
without
proving
that
the
anger
arises
only
from
the
injury
the
harm
and
the
justice
are
two
contrary
objects
of
which
the
one
has
a
tendency
to
produce
hatred
and
the
other
love
and
it
is
according
to
their
different
degrees
and
our
particular
turn
of
thinking
that
either
of
the
objects
prevails
and
excites
its
proper
passion
sect
iv
of
the
love
of
relations
having
given
a
reason
why
several
actions
that
cause
a
real
pleasure
or
uneasiness
excite
not
any
degree
or
but
a
small
one
of
the
passion
of
love
or
hatred
towards
the
actors
it
will
be
necessary
to
shew
wherein
consists
the
pleasure
or
uneasiness
of
many
objects
which
we
find
by
experience
to
produce
these
passions
according
to
the
preceding
system
there
is
always
required
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
betwixt
the
cause
and
effect
in
order
to
produce
either
love
or
hatred
but
though
this
be
universally
true
it
is
remarkable
that
the
passion
of
love
may
be
excited
by
only
one
relation
of
a
different
kind
viz
betwixt
ourselves
and
the
object
or
more
properly
speaking
that
this
relation
is
always
attended
with
both
the
others
whoever
is
united
to
us
by
any
connexion
is
always
sure
of
a
share
of
our
love
proportioned
to
the
connexion
without
enquiring
into
his
other
qualities
thus
the
relation
of
blood
produces
the
strongest
tie
the
mind
is
capable
of
in
the
love
of
parents
to
their
children
and
a
lesser
degree
of
the
same
affection
as
the
relation
lessens
nor
has
consanguinity
alone
this
effect
but
any
other
relation
without
exception
we
love
our
our
neighbours
those
of
the
same
trade
profession
and
even
name
with
ourselves
every
one
of
these
relations
is
esteemed
some
tie
and
gives
a
title
to
a
share
of
our
affection
there
is
another
phaenomenon
which
is
parallel
to
this
viz
that
acquaintance
without
any
kind
of
relation
gives
rise
to
love
and
kindness
when
we
have
contracted
a
habitude
and
intimacy
with
any
person
though
in
frequenting
his
company
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
any
very
valuable
quality
of
which
he
is
possessed
yet
we
can
not
forebear
preferring
him
to
strangers
of
whose
superior
merit
we
are
fully
convinced
these
two
phaenomena
of
the
effects
of
relation
and
acquaintance
will
give
mutual
light
to
each
other
and
may
be
both
explained
from
the
same
principle
those
who
take
a
pleasure
in
declaiming
against
human
nature
have
observed
that
man
is
altogether
insufficient
to
support
himself
and
that
when
you
loosen
all
the
holds
which
he
has
of
external
objects
he
immediately
drops
down
into
the
deepest
melancholy
and
despair
from
this
say
they
proceeds
that
continual
search
after
amusement
in
gaming
in
hunting
in
business
by
which
we
endeavour
to
forget
ourselves
and
excite
our
spirits
from
the
languid
state
into
which
they
fall
when
not
sustained
by
some
brisk
and
lively
emotion
to
this
method
of
thinking
i
so
far
agree
that
i
own
the
mind
to
be
insufficient
of
itself
to
its
own
entertainment
and
that
it
naturally
seeks
after
foreign
objects
which
may
produce
a
lively
sensation
and
agitate
the
spirits
on
the
appearance
of
such
an
object
it
awakes
as
it
were
from
a
dream
the
blood
flows
with
a
new
tide
the
heart
is
elevated
and
the
whole
man
acquires
a
vigour
which
he
can
not
command
in
his
solitary
and
calm
moments
hence
company
is
naturally
so
rejoicing
as
presenting
the
liveliest
of
all
objects
viz
a
rational
and
thinking
being
like
ourselves
who
communicates
to
us
all
the
actions
of
his
mind
makes
us
privy
to
his
inmost
sentiments
and
affections
and
lets
us
see
in
the
very
instant
of
their
production
all
the
emotions
which
are
caused
by
any
object
every
lively
idea
is
agreeable
but
especially
that
of
a
passion
because
such
an
idea
becomes
a
kind
of
passion
and
gives
a
more
sensible
agitation
to
the
mind
than
any
other
image
or
conception
this
being
once
admitted
all
the
rest
is
easy
for
as
the
company
of
strangers
is
agreeable
to
us
for
a
short
time
by
inlivening
our
thought
so
the
company
of
our
relations
and
acquaintance
must
be
peculiarly
agreeable
because
it
has
this
effect
in
a
greater
degree
and
is
of
more
durable
influence
whatever
is
related
to
us
is
conceived
in
a
lively
manner
by
the
easy
transition
from
ourselves
to
the
related
object
custom
also
or
acquaintance
facilitates
the
entrance
and
strengthens
the
conception
of
any
object
the
first
case
is
parallel
to
our
reasonings
from
cause
and
effect
the
second
to
education
and
as
reasoning
and
education
concur
only
in
producing
a
lively
and
strong
idea
of
any
object
so
is
this
the
only
particular
which
is
common
to
relation
and
acquaintance
this
must
therefore
be
the
influencing
quality
by
which
they
produce
all
their
common
effects
and
love
or
kindness
being
one
of
these
effects
it
must
be
from
the
force
and
liveliness
of
conception
that
the
passion
is
derived
such
a
conception
is
peculiarly
agreeable
and
makes
us
have
an
affectionate
regard
for
every
thing
that
produces
it
when
the
proper
object
of
kindness
and
goodwill
it
is
obvious
that
people
associate
together
according
to
their
particular
tempers
and
dispositions
and
that
men
of
gay
tempers
naturally
love
the
gay
as
the
serious
bear
an
affection
to
the
serious
this
not
only
happens
where
they
remark
this
resemblance
betwixt
themselves
and
others
but
also
by
the
natural
course
of
the
disposition
and
by
a
certain
sympathy
which
always
arises
betwixt
similar
characters
where
they
remark
the
resemblance
it
operates
after
the
manner
of
a
relation
by
producing
a
connexion
of
ideas
where
they
do
not
remark
it
it
operates
by
some
other
principle
and
if
this
latter
principle
be
similar
to
the
former
it
must
be
received
as
a
confirmation
of
the
foregoing
reasoning
the
idea
of
ourselves
is
always
intimately
present
to
us
and
conveys
a
sensible
degree
of
vivacity
to
the
idea
of
any
other
object
to
which
we
are
related
this
lively
idea
changes
by
degrees
into
a
real
impression
these
two
kinds
of
perception
being
in
a
great
measure
the
same
and
differing
only
in
their
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
but
this
change
must
be
produced
with
the
greater
ease
that
our
natural
temper
gives
us
a
propensity
to
the
same
impression
which
we
observe
in
others
and
makes
it
arise
upon
any
slight
occasion
in
that
case
resemblance
converts
the
idea
into
an
impression
not
only
by
means
of
the
relation
and
by
transfusing
the
original
vivacity
into
the
related
idea
but
also
by
presenting
such
materials
as
take
fire
from
the
least
spark
and
as
in
both
cases
a
love
or
affection
arises
from
the
resemblance
we
may
learn
that
a
sympathy
with
others
is
agreeable
only
by
giving
an
emotion
to
the
spirits
since
an
easy
sympathy
and
correspondent
emotions
are
alone
common
to
relation
acquaintance
and
resemblance
the
great
propensity
men
have
to
pride
may
be
considered
as
another
similar
phaenomenon
it
often
happens
that
after
we
have
lived
a
considerable
time
in
any
city
however
at
first
it
might
be
disagreeable
to
us
yet
as
we
become
familiar
with
the
objects
and
contact
an
acquaintance
though
merely
with
the
streets
and
buildings
the
aversion
diminishes
by
degrees
and
at
last
changes
into
the
opposite
passion
the
mind
finds
a
satisfaction
and
ease
in
the
view
of
objects
to
which
it
is
accustomed
and
naturally
prefers
them
to
others
which
though
perhaps
in
themselves
more
valuable
are
less
known
to
it
by
the
same
quality
of
the
mind
we
are
seduced
into
a
good
opinion
of
ourselves
and
of
all
objects
that
belong
to
us
they
appear
in
a
stronger
light
are
more
agreeable
and
consequently
fitter
subjects
of
pride
and
vanity
than
any
other
it
may
not
be
amiss
in
treating
of
the
affection
we
bear
our
acquaintance
and
relations
to
observe
some
pretty
curious
phaenomena
which
attend
it
it
is
easy
to
remark
in
common
life
that
children
esteem
their
relation
to
their
mother
to
be
weakened
in
a
great
measure
by
her
second
marriage
and
no
longer
regard
her
with
the
same
eye
as
if
she
had
continued
in
her
state
of
nor
does
this
happen
only
when
they
have
felt
any
inconveniences
from
her
second
marriage
or
when
her
husband
is
much
her
inferior
but
even
without
any
of
these
considerations
and
merely
because
she
has
become
part
of
another
family
this
also
takes
place
with
regard
to
the
second
marriage
of
a
father
but
in
a
much
less
degree
and
it
is
certain
the
ties
of
blood
are
not
so
much
loosened
in
the
latter
case
as
by
the
marriage
of
a
mother
these
two
phaenomena
are
remarkable
in
themselves
but
much
more
so
when
compared
in
order
to
produce
a
perfect
relation
betwixt
two
objects
it
is
requisite
not
only
that
the
imagination
be
conveyed
from
one
to
the
other
by
resemblance
contiguity
or
causation
but
also
that
it
return
back
from
the
second
to
the
first
with
the
same
ease
and
facility
at
first
sight
this
may
seem
a
necessary
and
unavoidable
consequence
if
one
object
resemble
another
the
latter
object
must
necessarily
resemble
the
former
if
one
object
be
the
cause
of
another
the
second
object
is
effect
to
its
cause
it
is
the
same
case
with
contiguity
and
therefore
the
relation
being
always
reciprocal
it
may
be
thought
that
the
return
of
the
imagination
from
the
second
to
the
first
must
also
in
every
case
be
equally
natural
as
its
passage
from
the
first
to
the
second
but
upon
farther
examination
we
shall
easily
discover
our
mistake
for
supposing
the
second
object
beside
its
reciprocal
relation
to
the
first
to
have
also
a
strong
relation
to
a
third
object
in
that
case
the
thought
passing
from
the
first
object
to
the
second
returns
not
back
with
the
same
facility
though
the
relation
continues
the
same
but
is
readily
carryed
on
to
the
third
object
by
means
of
the
new
relation
which
presents
itself
and
gives
a
new
impulse
to
the
imagination
this
new
relation
therefore
weakens
the
tie
betwixt
the
first
and
second
objects
the
fancy
is
by
its
very
nature
wavering
and
inconstant
and
considers
always
two
objects
as
more
strongly
related
together
where
it
finds
the
passage
equally
easy
both
in
going
and
returning
than
where
the
transition
is
easy
only
in
one
of
these
motions
the
double
motion
is
a
kind
of
a
double
tie
and
binds
the
objects
together
in
the
closest
and
most
intimate
manner
the
second
marriage
of
a
mother
breaks
not
the
relation
of
child
and
parent
and
that
relation
suffices
to
convey
my
imagination
from
myself
to
her
with
the
greatest
ease
and
facility
but
after
the
imagination
is
arrived
at
this
point
of
view
it
finds
its
object
to
be
surrounded
with
so
many
other
relations
which
challenge
its
regard
that
it
knows
not
which
to
prefer
and
is
at
a
loss
what
new
object
to
pitch
upon
the
ties
of
interest
and
duty
bind
her
to
another
family
and
prevent
that
return
of
the
fancy
from
her
to
myself
which
is
necessary
to
support
the
union
the
thought
has
no
longer
the
vibration
requisite
to
set
it
perfectly
at
ease
and
indulge
its
inclination
to
change
it
goes
with
facility
but
returns
with
difficulty
and
by
that
interruption
finds
the
relation
much
weakened
from
what
it
would
be
were
the
passage
open
and
easy
on
both
sides
now
to
give
a
reason
why
this
effect
follows
not
in
the
same
degree
upon
the
second
marriage
of
a
father
we
may
reflect
on
what
has
been
proved
already
that
though
the
imagination
goes
easily
from
the
view
of
a
lesser
object
to
that
of
a
greater
yet
it
returns
not
with
the
same
facility
from
the
greater
to
the
less
when
my
imagination
goes
from
myself
to
my
father
it
passes
not
so
readily
from
him
to
his
second
wife
nor
considers
him
as
entering
into
a
different
family
but
as
continuing
the
head
of
that
family
of
which
i
am
myself
a
part
his
superiority
prevents
the
easy
transition
of
the
thought
from
him
to
his
spouse
but
keeps
the
passage
still
open
for
a
return
to
myself
along
the
same
relation
of
child
and
parent
he
is
not
sunk
in
the
new
relation
he
acquires
so
that
the
double
motion
or
vibration
of
thought
is
still
easy
and
natural
by
this
indulgence
of
the
fancy
in
its
inconstancy
the
tie
of
child
and
parent
still
preserves
its
full
force
and
influence
a
mother
thinks
not
her
tie
to
a
son
weakened
because
it
is
shared
with
her
husband
nor
a
son
his
with
a
parent
because
it
is
shared
with
a
brother
the
third
object
is
here
related
to
the
first
as
well
as
to
the
second
so
that
the
imagination
goes
and
comes
along
all
of
them
with
the
greatest
facility
sect
v
of
our
esteem
for
the
rich
and
powerful
nothing
has
a
greater
tendency
to
give
us
an
esteem
for
any
person
than
his
power
and
riches
or
a
contempt
than
his
poverty
and
meanness
and
as
esteem
and
contempt
are
to
be
considered
as
species
of
love
and
hatred
it
will
be
proper
in
this
place
to
explain
these
phaenomena
here
it
happens
most
fortunately
that
the
greatest
difficulty
is
not
to
discover
a
principle
capable
of
producing
such
an
effect
but
to
choose
the
chief
and
predominant
among
several
that
present
themselves
the
satisfaction
we
take
in
the
riches
of
others
and
the
esteem
we
have
for
the
possessors
may
be
ascribed
to
three
different
causes
first
to
the
objects
they
possess
such
as
houses
gardens
equipages
which
being
agreeable
in
themselves
necessarily
produce
a
sentiment
of
pleasure
in
every
one
that
either
considers
or
surveys
them
secondly
to
the
expectation
of
advantage
from
the
rich
and
powerful
by
our
sharing
their
possessions
thirdly
to
sympathy
which
makes
us
partake
of
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
that
approaches
us
all
these
principles
may
concur
in
producing
the
present
phaenomenon
the
question
is
to
which
of
them
we
ought
principally
to
ascribe
it
it
is
certain
that
the
first
principle
viz
the
reflection
on
agreeable
objects
has
a
greater
influence
than
what
at
first
sight
we
may
be
apt
to
imagine
we
seldom
reflect
on
what
is
beautiful
or
ugly
agreeable
or
disagreeable
without
an
emotion
of
pleasure
or
uneasiness
and
though
these
sensations
appear
not
much
in
our
common
indolent
way
of
thinking
it
is
easy
either
in
reading
or
conversation
to
discover
them
men
of
wit
always
turn
the
discourse
on
subjects
that
are
entertaining
to
the
imagination
and
poets
never
present
any
objects
but
such
as
are
of
the
same
nature
mr
philips
has
chosen
cyder
for
the
subject
of
an
excellent
poem
beer
would
not
have
been
so
proper
as
being
neither
so
agreeable
to
the
taste
nor
eye
but
he
would
certainly
have
preferred
wine
to
either
of
them
coued
his
native
country
have
afforded
him
so
agreeable
a
liquor
we
may
learn
from
thence
that
every
thing
which
is
agreeable
to
the
senses
is
also
in
some
measure
agreeable
to
the
fancy
and
conveys
to
the
thought
an
image
of
that
satisfaction
which
it
gives
by
its
real
application
to
the
bodily
organs
but
though
these
reasons
may
induce
us
to
comprehend
this
delicacy
of
the
imagination
among
the
causes
of
the
respect
which
we
pay
the
rich
and
powerful
there
are
many
other
reasons
that
may
keep
us
from
regarding
it
as
the
sole
or
principal
for
as
the
ideas
of
pleasure
can
have
an
influence
only
by
means
of
their
vivacity
which
makes
them
approach
impressions
it
is
most
natural
those
ideas
should
have
that
influence
which
are
favoured
by
most
circumstances
and
have
a
natural
tendency
to
become
strong
and
lively
such
as
our
ideas
of
the
passions
and
sensations
of
any
human
creature
every
human
creature
resembles
ourselves
and
by
that
means
has
an
advantage
above
any
other
object
in
operating
on
the
imagination
besides
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
that
faculty
and
the
great
influence
which
all
relations
have
upon
it
we
shall
easily
be
persuaded
that
however
the
ideas
of
the
pleasant
wines
music
or
gardens
which
the
rich
man
enjoys
may
become
lively
and
agreeable
the
fancy
will
not
confine
itself
to
them
but
will
carry
its
view
to
the
related
objects
and
in
particular
to
the
person
who
possesses
them
and
this
is
the
more
natural
that
the
pleasant
idea
or
image
produces
here
a
passion
towards
the
person
by
means
of
his
relation
to
the
object
so
that
it
is
unavoidable
but
he
must
enter
into
the
original
conception
since
he
makes
the
object
of
the
derivative
passion
but
if
he
enters
into
the
original
conception
and
is
considered
as
enjoying
these
agreeable
objects
it
is
sympathy
which
is
properly
the
cause
of
the
affection
and
the
third
principle
is
more
powerful
and
universal
than
the
first
add
to
this
that
riches
and
power
alone
even
though
unemployed
naturally
cause
esteem
and
respect
and
consequently
these
passions
arise
not
from
the
idea
of
any
beautiful
or
agreeable
objects
it
is
true
money
implies
a
kind
of
representation
of
such
objects
by
the
power
it
affords
of
obtaining
them
and
for
that
reason
may
still
be
esteemed
proper
to
convey
those
agreeable
images
which
may
give
rise
to
the
passion
but
as
this
prospect
is
very
distant
it
is
more
natural
for
us
to
take
a
contiguous
object
viz
the
satisfaction
which
this
power
affords
the
person
who
is
possest
of
it
and
of
this
we
shall
be
farther
satisfyed
if
we
consider
that
riches
represent
the
goods
of
life
only
by
means
of
the
will
which
employs
them
and
therefore
imply
in
their
very
nature
an
idea
of
the
person
and
can
not
be
considered
without
a
kind
of
sympathy
with
his
sensations
and
enjoyments
this
we
may
confirm
by
a
reflection
which
to
some
will
perhaps
appear
too
subtile
and
refined
i
have
already
observed
that
power
as
distinguished
from
its
exercise
has
either
no
meaning
at
all
or
is
nothing
but
a
possibility
or
probability
of
existence
by
which
any
object
approaches
to
reality
and
has
a
sensible
influence
on
the
mind
i
have
also
observed
that
this
approach
by
an
illusion
of
the
fancy
appears
much
greater
when
we
ourselves
are
possest
of
the
power
than
when
it
is
enjoyed
by
another
and
that
in
the
former
case
the
objects
seem
to
touch
upon
the
very
verge
of
reality
and
convey
almost
an
equal
satisfaction
as
if
actually
in
our
possession
now
i
assert
that
where
we
esteem
a
person
upon
account
of
his
riches
we
must
enter
into
this
sentiment
of
the
proprietor
and
that
without
such
a
sympathy
the
idea
of
the
agreeable
objects
which
they
give
him
the
power
to
produce
would
have
but
a
feeble
influence
upon
us
an
avaritious
man
is
respected
for
his
money
though
he
scarce
is
possest
of
a
power
that
is
there
scarce
is
a
probability
or
even
possibility
of
his
employing
it
in
the
acquisition
of
the
pleasures
and
conveniences
of
life
to
himself
alone
this
power
seems
perfect
and
entire
and
therefore
we
must
receive
his
sentiments
by
sympathy
before
we
can
have
a
strong
intense
idea
of
these
enjoyments
or
esteem
him
upon
account
of
them
thus
we
have
found
that
the
first
principle
viz
the
agreeable
idea
of
those
objects
which
riches
afford
the
enjoyment
of
resolves
itself
in
a
great
measure
into
the
third
and
becomes
a
sympathy
with
the
person
we
esteem
or
love
let
us
now
examine
the
second
principle
viz
the
agreeable
expectation
of
advantage
and
see
what
force
we
may
justly
attribute
to
it
it
is
obvious
that
though
riches
and
authority
undoubtedly
give
their
owner
a
power
of
doing
us
service
yet
this
power
is
not
to
be
considered
as
on
the
same
footing
with
that
which
they
afford
him
of
pleasing
himself
and
satisfying
his
own
appetites
approaches
the
power
and
exercise
very
near
each
other
in
the
latter
case
but
in
order
to
produce
a
similar
effect
in
the
former
we
must
suppose
a
friendship
and
to
be
conjoined
with
the
riches
without
that
circumstance
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
on
what
we
can
found
our
hope
of
advantage
from
the
riches
of
others
though
there
is
nothing
more
certain
than
that
we
naturally
esteem
and
respect
the
rich
even
before
we
discover
in
them
any
such
favourable
disposition
towards
us
but
i
carry
this
farther
and
observe
not
only
that
we
respect
the
rich
and
powerful
where
they
shew
no
inclination
to
serve
us
but
also
when
we
lie
so
much
out
of
the
sphere
of
their
activity
that
they
can
not
even
be
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
that
power
prisoners
of
war
are
always
treated
with
a
respect
suitable
to
their
condition
and
it
is
certain
riches
go
very
far
towards
fixing
the
condition
of
any
person
if
birth
and
quality
enter
for
a
share
this
still
affords
us
an
argument
of
the
same
kind
for
what
is
it
we
call
a
man
of
birth
but
one
who
is
descended
from
a
long
succession
of
rich
and
powerful
ancestors
and
who
acquires
our
esteem
by
his
relation
to
persons
whom
we
esteem
his
ancestors
therefore
though
dead
are
respected
in
some
measure
on
account
of
their
riches
and
consequently
without
any
kind
of
expectation
but
not
to
go
so
far
as
prisoners
of
war
and
the
dead
to
find
instances
of
this
disinterested
esteem
for
riches
let
us
observe
with
a
little
attention
those
phaenomena
that
occur
to
us
in
common
life
and
conversation
a
man
who
is
himself
of
a
competent
fortune
upon
coming
into
a
company
of
strangers
naturally
treats
them
with
different
degrees
of
respect
and
deference
as
he
is
informed
of
their
different
fortunes
and
conditions
though
it
is
impossible
he
can
ever
propose
and
perhaps
would
not
accept
of
any
advantage
from
them
a
traveller
is
always
admitted
into
company
and
meets
with
civility
in
proportion
as
his
train
and
equipage
speak
him
a
man
of
great
or
moderate
fortune
in
short
the
different
ranks
of
men
are
in
a
great
measure
regulated
by
riches
and
that
with
regard
to
superiors
as
well
as
inferiors
strangers
as
well
as
acquaintance
there
is
indeed
an
answer
to
these
arguments
drawn
from
the
influence
of
general
rules
it
may
be
pretended
that
being
accustomed
to
expect
succour
and
protection
from
the
rich
and
powerful
and
to
esteem
them
upon
that
account
we
extend
the
same
sentiments
to
those
who
resemble
them
in
their
fortune
but
from
whom
we
can
never
hope
for
any
advantage
the
general
rule
still
prevails
and
by
giving
a
bent
to
the
imagination
draws
along
the
passion
in
the
same
manner
as
if
its
proper
object
were
real
and
existent
but
that
this
principle
does
not
here
take
place
will
easily
appear
if
we
consider
that
in
order
to
establish
a
general
rule
and
extend
it
beyond
its
proper
bounds
there
is
required
a
certain
uniformity
in
our
experience
and
a
great
superiority
of
those
instances
which
are
conformable
to
the
rule
above
the
contrary
but
here
the
case
is
quite
otherwise
of
a
hundred
men
of
credit
and
fortune
i
meet
with
there
is
not
perhaps
one
from
whom
i
can
expect
advantage
so
that
it
is
impossible
any
custom
can
ever
prevail
in
the
present
case
upon
the
whole
there
remains
nothing
which
can
give
us
an
esteem
for
power
and
riches
and
a
contempt
for
meanness
and
poverty
except
the
principle
of
sympathy
by
which
we
enter
into
the
sentiments
of
the
rich
and
poor
and
partake
of
their
pleasure
and
uneasiness
riches
give
satisfaction
to
their
possessor
and
this
satisfaction
is
conveyed
to
the
beholder
by
the
imagination
which
produces
an
idea
resembling
the
original
impression
in
force
and
vivacity
this
agreeable
idea
or
impression
is
connected
with
love
which
is
an
agreeable
passion
it
proceeds
from
a
thinking
conscious
being
which
is
the
very
object
of
love
from
this
relation
of
impressions
and
identity
of
ideas
the
passion
arises
according
to
my
hypothesis
the
best
method
of
reconciling
us
to
this
opinion
is
to
take
a
general
survey
of
the
universe
and
observe
the
force
of
sympathy
through
the
whole
animal
creation
and
the
easy
communication
of
sentiments
from
one
thinking
being
to
another
in
all
creatures
that
prey
not
upon
others
and
are
not
agitated
with
violent
passions
there
appears
a
remarkable
desire
of
company
which
associates
them
together
without
any
advantages
they
can
ever
propose
to
reap
from
their
union
this
is
still
more
conspicuous
in
man
as
being
the
creature
of
the
universe
who
has
the
most
ardent
desire
of
society
and
is
fitted
for
it
by
the
most
advantages
we
can
form
no
wish
which
has
not
a
reference
to
society
a
perfect
solitude
is
perhaps
the
greatest
punishment
we
can
suffer
every
pleasure
languishes
when
enjoyed
from
company
and
every
pain
becomes
more
cruel
and
intolerable
whatever
other
passions
we
may
be
actuated
by
pride
ambition
avarice
curiosity
revenge
or
lust
the
soul
or
animating
principle
of
them
all
is
sympathy
nor
would
they
have
any
force
were
we
to
abstract
entirely
from
the
thoughts
and
sentiments
of
others
let
all
the
powers
and
elements
of
nature
conspire
to
serve
and
obey
one
man
let
the
sun
rise
and
set
at
his
command
the
sea
and
rivers
roll
as
he
pleases
and
the
earth
furnish
spontaneously
whatever
may
be
useful
or
agreeable
to
him
he
will
still
be
miserable
till
you
give
him
some
one
person
at
least
with
whom
he
may
share
his
happiness
and
whose
esteem
and
friendship
he
may
enjoy
this
conclusion
from
a
general
view
of
human
nature
we
may
confirm
by
particular
instances
wherein
the
force
of
sympathy
is
very
remarkable
most
kinds
of
beauty
are
derived
from
this
origin
and
though
our
first
object
be
some
senseless
inanimate
piece
of
matter
it
is
seldom
we
rest
there
and
carry
not
our
view
to
its
influence
on
sensible
and
rational
creatures
a
man
who
shews
us
any
house
or
building
takes
particular
care
among
other
things
to
point
out
the
convenience
of
the
apartments
the
advantages
of
their
situation
and
the
little
room
lost
in
the
stairs
antichambers
and
passages
and
indeed
it
is
evident
the
chief
part
of
the
beauty
consists
in
these
particulars
the
observation
of
convenience
gives
pleasure
since
convenience
is
a
beauty
but
after
what
manner
does
it
give
pleasure
it
is
certain
our
own
interest
is
not
in
the
least
concerned
and
as
this
is
a
beauty
of
interest
not
of
form
so
to
speak
it
must
delight
us
merely
by
communication
and
by
our
sympathizing
with
the
proprietor
of
the
lodging
we
enter
into
his
interest
by
the
force
of
imagination
and
feel
the
same
satisfaction
that
the
objects
naturally
occasion
in
him
this
observation
extends
to
tables
chairs
scritoires
chimneys
coaches
sadles
ploughs
and
indeed
to
every
work
of
art
it
being
an
universal
rule
that
their
beauty
is
chiefly
derived
from
their
utility
and
from
their
fitness
for
that
purpose
to
which
they
are
destined
but
this
is
an
advantage
that
concerns
only
the
owner
nor
is
there
any
thing
but
sympathy
which
can
interest
the
spectator
it
is
evident
that
nothing
renders
a
field
more
agreeable
than
its
fertility
and
that
scarce
any
advantages
of
ornament
or
situation
will
be
able
to
equal
this
beauty
it
is
the
same
case
with
particular
trees
and
plants
as
with
the
field
on
which
they
grow
i
know
not
but
a
plain
overgrown
with
furze
and
broom
may
be
in
itself
as
beautiful
as
a
hill
covered
with
vines
or
though
it
will
never
appear
so
to
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
value
of
each
but
this
is
a
beauty
merely
of
imagination
and
has
no
foundation
in
what
appears
to
the
senses
fertility
and
value
have
a
plain
reference
to
use
and
that
to
riches
joy
and
plenty
in
which
though
we
have
no
hope
of
partaking
yet
we
enter
into
them
by
the
vivacity
of
the
fancy
and
share
them
in
some
measure
with
the
proprietor
there
is
no
rule
in
painting
more
reasonable
than
that
of
ballancing
the
figures
and
placing
them
with
the
greatest
exactness
on
their
proper
centers
of
gravity
a
figure
which
is
not
justly
ballanced
is
disagreeable
and
that
because
it
conveys
the
ideas
of
its
fall
of
harm
and
of
pain
which
ideas
are
painful
when
by
sympathy
they
acquire
any
degree
of
force
and
vivacity
add
to
this
that
the
principal
part
of
personal
beauty
is
an
air
of
health
and
vigour
and
such
a
construction
of
members
as
promises
strength
and
activity
this
idea
of
beauty
can
not
be
accounted
for
but
by
sympathy
in
general
we
may
remark
that
the
minds
of
men
are
mirrors
to
one
another
not
only
because
they
reflect
each
others
emotions
but
also
because
those
rays
of
passions
sentiments
and
opinions
may
be
often
reverberated
and
may
decay
away
by
insensible
degrees
thus
the
pleasure
which
a
rich
man
receives
from
his
possessions
being
thrown
upon
the
beholder
causes
a
pleasure
and
esteem
which
sentiments
again
being
perceived
and
sympathized
with
encrease
the
pleasure
of
the
possessor
and
being
once
more
reflected
become
a
new
foundation
for
pleasure
and
esteem
in
the
beholder
there
is
certainly
an
original
satisfaction
in
riches
derived
from
that
power
which
they
bestow
of
enjoying
all
the
pleasures
of
life
and
as
this
is
their
very
nature
and
essence
it
must
be
the
first
source
of
all
the
passions
which
arise
from
them
one
of
the
most
considerable
of
these
passions
is
that
of
love
or
esteem
in
others
which
therefore
proceeds
from
a
sympathy
with
the
pleasure
of
the
possessor
but
the
possessor
has
also
a
secondary
satisfaction
in
riches
arising
from
the
love
and
esteem
he
acquires
by
them
and
this
satisfaction
is
nothing
but
a
second
reflexion
of
that
original
pleasure
which
proceeded
from
himself
this
secondary
satisfaction
or
vanity
becomes
one
of
the
principal
recommendations
of
riches
and
is
the
chief
reason
why
we
either
desire
them
for
ourselves
or
esteem
them
in
others
here
then
is
a
third
rebound
of
the
original
pleasure
after
which
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
the
images
and
reflexions
by
reason
of
their
faintness
and
confusion
sect
vi
of
benevolence
and
anger
ideas
may
be
compared
to
the
extension
and
solidity
of
matter
and
impressions
especially
reflective
ones
to
colours
tastes
smells
and
other
sensible
qualities
ideas
never
admit
of
a
total
union
but
are
endowed
with
a
kind
of
impenetrability
by
which
they
exclude
each
other
and
are
capable
of
forming
a
compound
by
their
conjunction
not
by
their
mixture
on
the
other
hand
impressions
and
passions
are
susceptible
of
an
entire
union
and
like
colours
may
be
blended
so
perfectly
together
that
each
of
them
may
lose
itself
and
contribute
only
to
vary
that
uniform
impression
which
arises
from
the
whole
some
of
the
most
curious
phaenomena
of
the
human
mind
are
derived
from
this
property
of
the
passions
in
examining
those
ingredients
which
are
capable
of
uniting
with
love
and
hatred
i
begin
to
be
sensible
in
some
measure
of
a
misfortune
that
has
attended
every
system
of
philosophy
with
which
the
world
has
been
yet
acquainted
it
is
commonly
found
that
in
accounting
for
the
operations
of
nature
by
any
particular
hypothesis
among
a
number
of
experiments
that
quadrate
exactly
with
the
principles
we
would
endeavour
to
establish
there
is
always
some
phaenomenon
which
is
more
stubborn
and
will
not
so
easily
bend
to
our
purpose
we
need
not
be
surprized
that
this
should
happen
in
natural
philosophy
the
essence
and
composition
of
external
bodies
are
so
obscure
that
we
must
necessarily
in
our
reasonings
or
rather
conjectures
concerning
them
involve
ourselves
in
contradictions
and
absurdities
but
as
the
perceptions
of
the
mind
are
perfectly
known
and
i
have
used
all
imaginable
caution
in
forming
conclusions
concerning
them
i
have
always
hoped
to
keep
clear
of
those
contradictions
which
have
attended
every
other
system
accordingly
the
difficulty
which
i
have
at
present
in
my
eye
is
nowise
contrary
to
my
system
but
only
departs
a
little
from
that
simplicity
which
has
been
hitherto
its
principal
force
and
beauty
the
passions
of
love
and
hatred
are
always
followed
by
or
rather
conjoined
with
benevolence
and
anger
it
is
this
conjunction
which
chiefly
distinguishes
these
affections
from
pride
and
humility
for
pride
and
humility
are
pure
emotions
in
the
soul
unattended
with
any
desire
and
not
immediately
exciting
us
to
action
but
love
and
hatred
are
not
compleated
within
themselves
nor
rest
in
that
emotion
which
they
produce
but
carry
the
mind
to
something
farther
love
is
always
followed
by
a
desire
of
the
happiness
of
the
person
beloved
and
an
aversion
to
his
misery
as
hatred
produces
a
desire
of
the
misery
and
an
aversion
to
the
happiness
of
the
person
hated
so
remarkable
a
difference
betwixt
these
two
sets
of
passions
of
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
which
in
so
many
other
particulars
correspond
to
each
other
merits
our
attention
the
conjunction
of
this
desire
and
aversion
with
love
and
hatred
may
be
accounted
for
by
two
different
hypotheses
the
first
is
that
love
and
hatred
have
not
only
a
cause
which
excites
them
viz
pleasure
and
pain
and
an
object
to
which
they
are
directed
viz
a
person
or
thinking
being
but
likewise
an
end
which
they
endeavour
to
attain
viz
the
happiness
or
misery
of
the
person
beloved
or
hated
all
which
views
mixing
together
make
only
one
passion
according
to
this
system
love
is
nothing
but
the
desire
of
happiness
to
another
person
and
hatred
that
of
misery
the
desire
and
aversion
constitute
the
very
nature
of
love
and
hatred
they
are
not
only
inseparable
but
the
same
but
this
is
evidently
contrary
to
experience
for
though
it
is
certain
we
never
love
any
person
without
desiring
his
happiness
nor
hate
any
without
wishing
his
misery
yet
these
desires
arise
only
upon
the
ideas
of
the
happiness
or
misery
of
our
friend
or
enemy
being
presented
by
the
imagination
and
are
not
absolutely
essential
to
love
and
hatred
they
are
the
most
obvious
and
natural
sentiments
of
these
affections
but
not
the
only
ones
the
passions
may
express
themselves
in
a
hundred
ways
and
may
subsist
a
considerable
time
without
our
reflecting
on
the
happiness
or
misery
of
their
objects
which
clearly
proves
that
these
desires
are
not
the
same
with
love
and
hatred
nor
make
any
essential
part
of
them
we
may
therefore
infer
that
benevolence
and
anger
are
passions
different
from
love
and
hatred
and
only
conjoined
with
them
by
the
original
constitution
of
the
mind
as
nature
has
given
to
the
body
certain
appetites
and
inclinations
which
she
encreases
diminishes
or
changes
according
to
the
situation
of
the
fluids
or
solids
she
has
proceeded
in
the
same
manner
with
the
mind
according
as
we
are
possessed
with
love
or
hatred
the
correspondent
desire
of
the
happiness
or
misery
of
the
person
who
is
the
object
of
these
passions
arises
in
the
mind
and
varies
with
each
variation
of
these
opposite
passions
this
order
of
things
abstractedly
considered
is
not
necessary
love
and
hatred
might
have
been
unattended
with
any
such
desires
or
their
particular
connexion
might
have
been
entirely
reversed
if
nature
had
so
pleased
love
might
have
had
the
same
effect
as
hatred
and
hatred
as
love
i
see
no
contradiction
in
supposing
a
desire
of
producing
misery
annexed
to
love
and
of
happiness
to
hatred
if
the
sensation
of
the
passion
and
desire
be
opposite
nature
coued
have
altered
the
sensation
without
altering
the
tendency
of
the
desire
and
by
that
means
made
them
compatible
with
each

of
compassion
but
though
the
desire
of
the
happiness
or
misery
of
others
according
to
the
love
or
hatred
we
bear
them
be
an
arbitrary
and
original
instinct
implanted
in
our
nature
we
find
it
may
be
counterfeited
on
many
occasions
and
may
arise
from
secondary
principles
pity
is
a
concern
for
and
malice
a
joy
in
the
misery
of
others
without
any
friendship
or
enmity
to
occasion
this
concern
or
joy
we
pity
even
strangers
and
such
as
are
perfectly
indifferent
to
us
and
if
our
to
another
proceed
from
any
harm
or
injury
it
is
not
properly
speaking
malice
but
revenge
but
if
we
examine
these
affections
of
pity
and
malice
we
shall
find
them
to
be
secondary
ones
arising
from
original
affections
which
are
varied
by
some
particular
turn
of
thought
and
imagination
it
will
be
easy
to
explain
the
passion
of
pity
from
the
precedent
reasoning
concerning
sympathy
we
have
a
lively
idea
of
every
thing
related
to
us
all
human
creatures
are
related
to
us
by
resemblance
their
persons
therefore
their
interests
their
passions
their
pains
and
pleasures
must
strike
upon
us
in
a
lively
manner
and
produce
an
emotion
similar
to
the
original
one
since
a
lively
idea
is
easily
converted
into
an
impression
if
this
be
true
in
general
it
must
be
more
so
of
affliction
and
sorrow
these
have
always
a
stronger
and
more
lasting
influence
than
any
pleasure
or
enjoyment
a
spectator
of
a
tragedy
passes
through
a
long
train
of
grief
terror
indignation
and
other
affections
which
the
poet
represents
in
the
persons
he
introduces
as
many
tragedies
end
happily
and
no
excellent
one
can
be
composed
without
some
reverses
of
fortune
the
spectator
must
sympathize
with
all
these
changes
and
receive
the
fictitious
joy
as
well
as
every
other
passion
unless
therefore
it
be
asserted
that
every
distinct
passion
is
communicated
by
a
distinct
original
quality
and
is
not
derived
from
the
general
principle
of
sympathy
it
must
be
allowed
that
all
of
them
arise
from
that
principle
to
except
any
one
in
particular
must
appear
highly
unreasonable
as
they
are
all
first
present
in
the
mind
of
one
person
and
afterwards
appear
in
the
mind
of
another
and
as
the
manner
of
their
appearance
first
as
an
idea
then
as
an
impression
is
in
every
case
the
same
the
transition
must
arise
from
the
same
principle
i
am
at
least
sure
that
this
method
of
reasoning
would
be
considered
as
certain
either
in
natural
philosophy
or
common
life
add
to
this
that
pity
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
contiguity
and
even
sight
of
the
object
which
is
a
proof
that
it
is
derived
from
the
imagination
not
to
mention
that
women
and
children
are
most
subject
to
pity
as
being
most
guided
by
that
faculty
the
same
infirmity
which
makes
them
faint
at
the
sight
of
a
naked
sword
though
in
the
hands
of
their
best
friend
makes
them
pity
extremely
those
whom
they
find
in
any
grief
or
affliction
those
philosophers
who
derive
this
passion
from
i
know
not
what
subtile
reflections
on
the
instability
of
fortune
and
our
being
liable
to
the
same
miseries
we
behold
will
find
this
observation
contrary
to
them
among
a
great
many
others
which
it
were
easy
to
produce
there
remains
only
to
take
notice
of
a
pretty
remarkable
phaenomenon
of
this
passion
which
is
that
the
communicated
passion
of
sympathy
sometimes
acquires
strength
from
the
weakness
of
its
original
and
even
arises
by
a
transition
from
affections
which
have
no
existence
thus
when
a
person
obtains
any
honourable
office
or
inherits
a
great
fortune
we
are
always
the
more
rejoiced
for
his
prosperity
the
less
sense
he
seems
to
have
of
it
and
the
greater
equanimity
and
indifference
he
shews
in
its
enjoyment
in
like
manner
a
man
who
is
not
dejected
by
misfortunes
is
the
more
lamented
on
account
of
his
patience
and
if
that
virtue
extends
so
far
as
utterly
to
remove
all
sense
of
uneasiness
it
still
farther
encreases
our
compassion
when
a
person
of
merit
falls
into
what
is
vulgarly
esteemed
a
great
misfortune
we
form
a
notion
of
his
condition
and
carrying
our
fancy
from
the
cause
to
the
usual
effect
first
conceive
a
lively
idea
of
his
sorrow
and
then
feel
an
impression
of
it
entirely
that
greatness
of
mind
which
elevates
him
above
such
emotions
or
only
considering
it
so
far
as
to
encrease
our
admiration
love
and
tenderness
for
him
we
find
from
experience
that
such
a
degree
of
passion
is
usually
connected
with
such
a
misfortune
and
though
there
be
an
exception
in
the
present
case
yet
the
imagination
is
affected
by
the
general
rule
and
makes
us
conceive
a
lively
idea
of
the
passion
or
rather
feel
the
passion
itself
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
person
were
really
actuated
by
it
from
the
same
principles
we
blush
for
the
conduct
of
those
who
behave
themselves
foolishly
before
us
and
that
though
they
shew
no
sense
of
shame
nor
seem
in
the
least
conscious
of
their
folly
all
this
proceeds
from
sympathy
but
it
is
of
a
partial
kind
and
views
its
objects
only
on
one
side
without
considering
the
other
which
has
a
contrary
effect
and
would
entirely
destroy
that
emotion
which
arises
from
the
first
appearance
we
have
also
instances
wherein
an
indifference
and
insensibility
under
misfortune
encreases
our
concern
for
the
misfortunate
even
though
the
indifference
proceed
not
from
any
virtue
and
magnanimity
it
is
an
aggravation
of
a
murder
that
it
was
committed
upon
persons
asleep
and
in
perfect
security
as
historians
readily
observe
of
any
infant
prince
who
is
captive
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
that
he
is
the
more
worthy
of
compassion
the
less
sensible
he
is
of
his
miserable
condition
as
we
ourselves
are
here
acquainted
with
the
wretched
situation
of
the
person
it
gives
us
a
lively
idea
and
sensation
of
sorrow
which
is
the
passion
that
generally
attends
it
and
this
idea
becomes
still
more
lively
and
the
sensation
more
violent
by
a
contrast
with
that
security
and
indifference
which
we
observe
in
the
person
himself
a
contrast
of
any
kind
never
fails
to
affect
the
imagination
especially
when
presented
by
the
subject
and
it
is
on
the
imagination
that
pity
entirely
depends
footnote
to
prevent
all
ambiguity
i
must
observe
that
where
i
oppose
the
imagination
to
the
memory
i
mean
in
general
the
faculty
that
presents
our
fainter
ideas
in
all
other
places
and
particularly
when
it
is
opposed
to
the
understanding
i
understand
the
same
faculty
excluding
only
our
demonstrative
and
probable
reasonings
sect
viii
of
malice
and
envy
we
must
now
proceed
to
account
for
the
passion
of
malice
which
imitates
the
effects
of
hatred
as
pity
does
those
of
love
and
gives
us
a
joy
in
the
sufferings
and
miseries
of
others
without
any
offence
or
injury
on
their
part
so
little
are
men
governed
by
reason
in
their
sentiments
and
opinions
that
they
always
judge
more
of
objects
by
comparison
than
from
their
intrinsic
worth
and
value
when
the
mind
considers
or
is
accustomed
to
any
degree
of
perfection
whatever
falls
short
of
it
though
really
esteemable
has
notwithstanding
the
same
effect
upon
the
passions
as
what
is
defective
and
ill
this
is
an
original
quality
of
the
soul
and
similar
to
what
we
have
every
day
experience
of
in
our
bodies
let
a
man
heat
one
band
and
cool
the
other
the
same
water
will
at
the
same
time
seem
both
hot
and
cold
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
different
organs
a
small
degree
of
any
quality
succeeding
a
greater
produces
the
same
sensation
as
if
less
than
it
really
is
and
even
sometimes
as
the
opposite
quality
any
gentle
pain
that
follows
a
violent
one
seems
as
nothing
or
rather
becomes
a
pleasure
as
on
the
other
hand
a
violent
pain
succeeding
a
gentle
one
is
doubly
grievous
and
uneasy
this
no
one
can
doubt
of
with
regard
to
our
passions
and
sensations
but
there
may
arise
some
difficulty
with
regard
to
our
ideas
and
objects
when
an
object
augments
or
diminishes
to
the
eye
or
imagination
from
a
comparison
with
others
the
image
and
idea
of
the
object
are
still
the
same
and
are
equally
extended
in
the
retina
and
in
the
brain
or
organ
of
perception
the
eyes
refract
the
rays
of
light
and
the
optic
nerves
convey
the
images
to
the
brain
in
the
very
same
manner
whether
a
great
or
small
object
has
preceded
nor
does
even
the
imagination
alter
the
dimensions
of
its
object
on
account
of
a
comparison
with
others
the
question
then
is
how
from
the
same
impression
and
the
same
idea
we
can
form
such
different
judgments
concerning
the
same
object
and
at
one
time
admire
its
bulk
and
at
another
despise
its
littleness
this
variation
in
our
judgments
must
certainly
proceed
from
a
variation
in
some
perception
but
as
the
variation
lies
not
in
the
immediate
impression
or
idea
of
the
object
it
must
lie
in
some
other
impression
that
accompanies
it
in
order
to
explain
this
matter
i
shall
just
touch
upon
two
principles
one
of
which
shall
be
more
fully
explained
in
the
progress
of
this
treatise
the
other
has
been
already
accounted
for
i
believe
it
may
safely
be
established
for
a
general
maxim
that
no
object
is
presented
to
the
senses
nor
image
formed
in
the
fancy
but
what
is
accompanyed
with
some
emotion
or
movement
of
spirits
proportioned
to
it
and
however
custom
may
make
us
insensible
of
this
sensation
and
cause
us
to
confound
it
with
the
object
or
idea
it
will
be
easy
by
careful
and
exact
experiments
to
separate
and
distinguish
them
for
to
instance
only
in
the
cases
of
extension
and
number
it
is
evident
that
any
very
bulky
object
such
as
the
ocean
an
extended
plain
a
vast
chain
of
mountains
a
wide
forest
or
any
very
numerous
collection
of
objects
such
as
an
army
a
fleet
a
crowd
excite
in
the
mind
a
sensible
emotion
and
that
the
admiration
which
arises
on
the
appearance
of
such
objects
is
one
of
the
most
lively
pleasures
which
human
nature
is
capable
of
enjoying
now
as
this
admiration
encreases
or
diminishes
by
the
encrease
or
diminution
of
the
objects
we
may
conclude
according
to
our
foregoing
book
i
part
iii
sect
principles
that
it
is
a
compound
effect
proceeding
from
the
conjunction
of
the
several
effects
which
arise
from
each
part
of
the
cause
every
part
then
of
extension
and
every
unite
of
number
has
a
separate
emotion
attending
it
and
though
that
emotion
be
not
always
agreeable
yet
by
its
conjunction
with
others
and
by
its
agitating
the
spirits
to
a
just
pitch
it
contributes
to
the
production
of
admiration
which
is
always
agreeable
if
this
be
allowed
with
respect
to
extension
and
number
we
can
make
no
difficulty
with
respect
to
virtue
and
vice
wit
and
folly
riches
and
poverty
happiness
and
misery
and
other
objects
of
that
kind
which
are
always
attended
with
an
evident
emotion
the
second
principle
i
shall
take
notice
of
is
that
of
our
adherence
to
general
rules
which
has
such
a
mighty
influence
on
the
actions
and
understanding
and
is
able
to
impose
on
the
very
senses
when
an
object
is
found
to
be
always
accompanyed
with
another
whenever
the
first
object
appears
though
changed
in
very
material
circumstances
we
naturally
fly
to
the
conception
of
the
second
and
form
an
idea
of
it
in
as
lively
and
strong
a
manner
as
if
we
had
infered
its
existence
by
the
justest
and
most
authentic
conclusion
of
our
understanding
nothing
can
undeceive
us
not
even
our
senses
which
instead
of
correcting
this
false
judgment
are
often
perverted
by
it
and
seem
to
authorize
its
errors
the
conclusion
i
draw
from
these
two
principles
joined
to
the
influence
of
comparison
is
very
short
and
decisive
every
object
is
attended
with
some
emotion
proportioned
to
it
a
great
object
with
a
great
emotion
a
small
object
with
a
small
emotion
a
great
object
therefore
succeeding
a
small
one
makes
a
great
emotion
succeed
a
small
one
now
a
great
emotion
succeeding
a
small
one
becomes
still
greater
and
rises
beyond
its
ordinary
proportion
but
as
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
an
emotion
which
commonly
attends
every
magnitude
of
an
object
when
the
emotion
encreases
we
naturally
imagine
that
the
object
has
likewise
encreased
the
effect
conveys
our
view
to
its
usual
cause
a
certain
degree
of
emotion
to
a
certain
magnitude
of
the
object
nor
do
we
consider
that
comparison
may
change
the
emotion
without
changing
anything
in
the
object
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
metaphysical
part
of
optics
and
know
how
we
transfer
the
judgments
and
conclusions
of
the
understanding
to
the
senses
will
easily
conceive
this
whole
operation
but
leaving
this
new
discovery
of
an
impression
that
secretly
attends
every
idea
we
must
at
least
allow
of
that
principle
from
whence
the
discovery
arose
that
objects
appear
greater
or
less
by
a
comparison
with
others
we
have
so
many
instances
of
this
that
it
is
impossible
we
can
dispute
its
veracity
and
it
is
from
this
principle
i
derive
the
passions
of
malice
and
envy
it
is
evident
we
must
receive
a
greater
or
less
satisfaction
or
uneasiness
from
reflecting
on
our
own
condition
and
circumstances
in
proportion
as
they
appear
more
or
less
fortunate
or
unhappy
in
proportion
to
the
degrees
of
riches
and
power
and
merit
and
reputation
which
we
think
ourselves
possest
of
now
as
we
seldom
judge
of
objects
from
their
intrinsic
value
but
form
our
notions
of
them
from
a
comparison
with
other
objects
it
follows
that
according
as
we
observe
a
greater
or
less
share
of
happiness
or
misery
in
others
we
must
make
an
estimate
of
our
own
and
feel
a
consequent
pain
or
pleasure
the
misery
of
another
gives
us
a
more
lively
idea
of
our
happiness
and
his
happiness
of
our
misery
the
former
therefore
produces
delight
and
the
latter
uneasiness
here
then
is
a
kind
of
pity
reverst
or
contrary
sensations
arising
in
the
beholder
from
those
which
are
felt
by
the
person
whom
he
considers
in
general
we
may
observe
that
in
all
kinds
of
comparison
an
object
makes
us
always
receive
from
another
to
which
it
is
compared
a
sensation
contrary
to
what
arises
from
itself
in
its
direct
and
immediate
survey
a
small
object
makes
a
great
one
appear
still
greater
a
great
object
makes
a
little
one
appear
less
deformity
of
itself
produces
uneasiness
but
makes
us
receive
new
pleasure
by
its
contrast
with
a
beautiful
object
whose
beauty
is
augmented
by
it
as
on
the
other
hand
beauty
which
of
itself
produces
pleasure
makes
us
receive
a
new
pain
by
the
contrast
with
any
thing
ugly
whose
deformity
it
augments
the
case
therefore
must
be
the
same
with
happiness
and
misery
the
direct
survey
of
another
pleasure
naturally
gives
us
plcasure
and
therefore
produces
pain
when
cornpared
with
our
own
his
pain
considered
in
itself
is
painful
to
us
but
augments
the
idea
of
our
own
happiness
and
gives
us
pleasure
nor
will
it
appear
strange
that
we
may
feel
a
reverst
sensation
from
the
happiness
and
misery
of
others
since
we
find
the
same
comparison
may
give
us
a
kind
of
malice
against
ourselves
and
make
us
rejoice
for
our
pains
and
grieve
for
our
pleasures
thus
the
prospect
of
past
pain
is
agreeable
when
we
are
satisfyed
with
our
present
condition
as
on
the
other
hand
our
past
pleasures
give
us
uneasiness
when
we
enjoy
nothing
at
present
equal
to
them
the
comparison
being
the
same
as
when
we
reflect
on
the
sentiments
of
others
must
be
attended
with
the
same
effects
nay
a
person
may
extend
this
malice
against
himself
even
to
his
present
fortune
and
carry
it
so
far
as
designedly
to
seek
affliction
and
encrease
his
pains
and
sorrows
this
may
happen
upon
two
occasions
first
upon
the
distress
and
misfortune
of
a
friend
or
person
dear
to
him
secondly
upon
the
feeling
any
remorses
for
a
crime
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
it
is
from
the
principle
of
comparison
that
both
these
irregular
appetites
for
evil
arise
a
person
who
indulges
himself
in
any
pleasure
while
his
friend
lies
under
affliction
feels
the
reflected
uneasiness
from
his
friend
more
sensibly
by
a
comparison
with
the
original
pleasure
which
he
himself
enjoys
this
contrast
indeed
ought
also
to
inliven
the
present
pleasure
but
as
grief
is
here
supposed
to
be
the
predominant
passion
every
addition
falls
to
that
side
and
is
swallowed
up
in
it
without
operating
in
the
least
upon
the
contrary
affection
it
is
the
same
case
with
those
penances
which
men
inflict
on
themselves
for
their
past
sins
and
failings
when
a
criminal
reflects
on
the
punishment
he
deserves
the
idea
of
it
is
magnifyed
by
a
comparison
with
his
present
ease
and
satisfaction
which
forces
him
in
a
manner
to
seek
uneasiness
in
order
to
avoid
so
disagreeable
a
contrast
this
reasoning
will
account
for
the
origin
of
envy
as
well
as
of
malice
the
only
difference
betwixt
these
passions
lies
in
this
that
envy
is
excited
by
some
present
enjoyment
of
another
which
by
comparison
diminishes
our
idea
of
our
own
whereas
malice
is
the
unprovoked
desire
of
producing
evil
to
another
in
order
to
reap
a
pleasure
from
the
comparison
the
enjoyment
which
is
the
object
of
envy
is
commonly
superior
to
our
own
a
superiority
naturally
seems
to
overshade
us
and
presents
a
disagreeable
comparison
but
even
in
the
case
of
an
inferiority
we
still
desire
a
greater
distance
in
order
to
augment
still
more
the
idea
of
ourself
when
this
distance
diminishes
the
comparison
is
less
to
our
advantage
and
consequently
gives
us
less
pleasure
and
is
even
disagreeable
hence
arises
that
species
of
envy
which
men
feel
when
they
perceive
their
inferiors
approaching
or
overtaking
them
in
the
pursuits
of
glory
or
happiness
in
this
envy
we
may
see
the
effects
of
comparison
twice
repeated
a
man
who
compares
himself
to
his
inferior
receives
a
pleasure
from
the
comparison
and
when
the
inferiority
decreases
by
the
elevation
of
the
inferior
what
should
only
have
been
a
decrease
of
pleasure
becomes
a
real
pain
by
a
new
comparison
with
its
preceding
condition
it
is
worthy
of
observation
concerning
that
envy
which
arises
from
a
superiority
in
others
that
it
is
not
the
great
disproportion
betwixt
ourself
and
another
which
produces
it
but
on
the
contrary
our
proximity
a
common
soldier
bears
no
such
envy
to
his
general
as
to
his
sergeant
or
corporal
nor
does
an
eminent
writer
meet
with
so
great
jealousy
in
common
hackney
scriblers
as
in
authors
that
more
nearly
approach
him
it
may
indeed
be
thought
that
the
greater
the
disproportion
is
the
greater
must
be
the
uneasiness
from
the
comparison
but
we
may
consider
on
the
other
hand
that
the
great
disproportion
cuts
off
the
relation
and
either
keeps
us
from
comparing
ourselves
with
what
is
remote
from
us
or
diminishes
the
effects
of
the
comparison
resemblance
and
proximity
always
produce
a
relation
of
ideas
and
where
you
destroy
these
ties
however
other
accidents
may
bring
two
ideas
together
as
they
have
no
bond
or
connecting
quality
to
join
them
in
the
imagination
it
is
impossible
they
can
remain
long
united
or
have
any
considerable
influence
on
each
other
i
have
observed
in
considering
the
nature
of
ambition
that
the
great
feel
a
double
pleasure
in
authority
from
the
comparison
of
their
own
condition
with
that
of
their
slaves
and
that
this
comparison
has
a
double
influence
because
it
is
natural
and
presented
by
the
subject
when
the
fancy
in
the
comparison
of
objects
passes
not
easily
from
the
one
object
to
the
other
the
action
of
the
mind
is
in
a
great
measure
broke
and
the
fancy
in
considering
the
second
object
begins
as
it
were
upon
a
new
footing
the
impression
which
attends
every
object
seems
not
greater
in
that
case
by
succeeding
a
less
of
the
same
kind
but
these
two
impressions
are
distinct
and
produce
their
distinct
effects
without
any
communication
together
the
want
of
relation
in
the
ideas
breaks
the
relation
of
the
impressions
and
by
such
a
separation
prevents
their
mutual
operation
and
influence
to
confirm
this
we
may
observe
that
the
proximity
in
the
degree
of
merit
is
not
alone
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
envy
but
must
be
assisted
by
other
relations
a
poet
is
not
apt
to
envy
a
philosopher
or
a
poet
of
a
different
kind
of
a
different
nation
or
of
a
different
age
all
these
differences
prevent
or
weaken
the
comparison
and
consequently
the
passion
this
too
is
the
reason
why
all
objects
appear
great
or
little
merely
by
a
comparison
with
those
of
the
same
species
a
mountain
neither
magnifies
nor
diminishes
a
horse
in
our
eyes
but
when
a
flemish
and
a
welsh
horse
are
seen
together
the
one
appears
greater
and
the
other
less
than
when
viewed
apart
from
the
same
principle
we
may
account
for
that
remark
of
historians
that
any
party
in
a
civil
war
always
choose
to
call
in
a
foreign
enemy
at
any
hazard
rather
than
submit
to
their
guicciardin
applies
this
remark
to
the
wars
in
italy
where
the
relations
betwixt
the
different
states
are
properly
speaking
nothing
but
of
name
language
and
contiguity
yet
even
these
relations
when
joined
with
superiority
by
making
the
comparison
more
natural
make
it
likewise
more
grievous
and
cause
men
to
search
for
some
other
superiority
which
may
be
attended
with
no
relation
and
by
that
means
may
have
a
less
sensible
influence
on
the
imagination
the
mind
quickly
perceives
its
several
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
finding
its
situation
to
be
most
uneasy
where
superiority
is
conjoined
with
other
relations
seeks
its
repose
as
much
as
possible
by
their
separation
and
by
breaking
that
association
of
ideas
which
renders
the
comparison
so
much
more
natural
and
efficacious
when
it
can
not
break
the
association
it
feels
a
stronger
desire
to
remove
the
superiority
and
this
is
the
reason
why
travellers
are
commonly
so
lavish
of
their
praises
to
the
chinese
and
persians
at
the
same
time
that
they
depreciate
those
neighbouring
nations
which
may
stand
upon
a
foot
of
rivalship
with
their
native
country
these
examples
from
history
and
common
experience
are
rich
and
curious
but
we
may
find
parallel
ones
in
the
arts
which
are
no
less
remarkable
should
an
author
compose
a
treatise
of
which
one
part
was
serious
and
profound
another
light
and
humorous
every
one
would
condemn
so
strange
a
mixture
and
would
accuse
him
of
the
neglect
of
all
rules
of
art
and
criticism
these
rules
of
art
are
founded
on
the
qualities
of
human
nature
and
the
quality
of
human
nature
which
requires
a
consistency
in
every
performance
is
that
which
renders
the
mind
incapable
of
passing
in
a
moment
from
one
passion
and
disposition
to
a
quite
different
one
yet
this
makes
us
not
blame
mr
prior
for
joining
his
alma
and
his
solomon
in
the
same
volume
though
that
admirable
poet
has
succeeded
perfectly
well
in
the
gaiety
of
the
one
as
well
as
in
the
melancholy
of
the
other
even
supposing
the
reader
should
peruse
these
two
compositions
without
any
interval
he
would
feel
little
or
no
difficulty
in
the
change
of
passions
why
but
because
he
considers
these
performances
as
entirely
different
and
by
this
break
in
the
ideas
breaks
the
progress
of
the
affections
and
hinders
the
one
from
influencing
or
contradicting
the
other
an
heroic
and
burlesque
design
united
in
one
picture
would
be
monstrous
though
we
place
two
pictures
of
so
opposite
a
character
in
the
same
chamber
and
even
close
by
each
other
without
any
scruple
or
difficulty
in
a
word
no
ideas
can
affect
each
other
either
by
comparison
or
by
the
passions
they
separately
produce
unless
they
be
united
together
by
some
relation
which
may
cause
an
easy
transition
of
the
ideas
and
consequently
of
the
emotions
or
impressions
attending
the
ideas
and
may
preserve
the
one
impression
in
the
passage
of
the
imagination
to
the
object
of
the
other
this
principle
is
very
remarkable
because
it
is
analogous
to
what
we
have
observed
both
concerning
the
understanding
and
the
passions
suppose
two
objects
to
be
presented
to
me
which
are
not
connected
by
any
kind
of
relation
suppose
that
each
of
these
objects
separately
produces
a
passion
and
that
these
two
passions
are
in
themselves
contrary
we
find
from
experience
that
the
want
of
relation
in
the
objects
or
ideas
hinders
the
natural
contrariety
of
the
passions
and
that
the
break
in
the
transition
of
the
thought
removes
the
affections
from
each
other
and
prevents
their
opposition
it
is
the
same
case
with
comparison
and
from
both
these
phaenomena
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
relation
of
ideas
must
forward
the
transition
of
impressions
since
its
absence
alone
is
able
to
prevent
it
and
to
separate
what
naturally
should
have
operated
upon
each
other
when
the
absence
of
an
object
or
quality
re
moves
any
usual
or
natural
effect
we
may
certalnly
conclude
that
its
presence
contributes
to
the
production
of
the
effect
sect
ix
of
the
mixture
of
benevolence
and
anger
with
compassion
and
malice
thus
we
have
endeavoured
to
account
for
pity
and
malice
both
these
affections
arise
from
the
imagination
according
to
the
light
in
which
it
places
its
object
when
our
fancy
considers
directly
the
sentiments
of
others
and
enters
deep
into
them
it
makes
us
sensible
of
all
the
passions
it
surveys
but
in
a
particular
manner
of
grief
or
sorrow
on
the
contrary
when
we
compare
the
sentiments
of
others
to
our
own
we
feel
a
sensation
directly
opposite
to
the
original
one
viz
a
joy
from
the
grief
of
others
and
a
grief
from
their
joy
but
these
are
only
the
first
foundations
of
the
affections
of
pity
and
malice
other
passions
are
afterwards
confounded
with
them
there
is
always
a
mixture
of
love
or
tenderness
with
pity
and
of
hatred
or
anger
with
malice
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
mixture
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
contradictory
to
my
system
for
as
pity
is
an
uneasiness
and
malice
a
joy
arising
from
the
misery
of
others
pity
should
naturally
as
in
all
other
cases
produce
hatred
and
malice
love
this
contradiction
i
endeavour
to
reconcile
after
the
following
manner
in
order
to
cause
a
transition
of
passions
there
is
required
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
nor
is
one
relation
sufficient
to
produce
this
effect
but
that
we
may
understand
the
full
force
of
this
double
relation
we
must
consider
that
it
is
not
the
present
sensation
alone
or
momentary
pain
or
pleasure
which
determines
the
character
of
any
passion
but
the
whole
bent
or
tendency
of
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
one
impression
may
be
related
to
another
not
only
when
their
sensations
are
resembling
as
we
have
all
along
supposed
in
the
preceding
cases
but
also
when
their
im
pulses
or
directions
are
similar
and
correspondent
this
can
not
take
place
with
regard
to
pride
and
humility
because
these
are
only
pure
sensations
without
any
direction
or
tendency
to
action
we
are
therefore
to
look
for
instances
of
this
peculiar
relation
of
impressions
only
in
such
affections
as
are
attended
with
a
certain
appetite
or
desire
such
as
those
of
love
and
hatred
benevolence
or
the
appetite
which
attends
love
is
a
desire
of
the
happiness
of
the
person
beloved
and
an
aversion
to
his
misery
as
anger
or
the
appetite
which
attends
hatred
is
a
desire
of
the
misery
of
the
person
hated
and
an
aversion
to
his
happiness
a
desire
therefore
of
the
happiness
of
another
and
aversion
to
his
misery
are
similar
to
benevolence
and
a
desire
of
his
misery
and
aversion
to
his
happiness
are
correspondent
to
anger
now
pity
is
a
desire
of
happiness
to
another
and
aversion
to
his
misery
as
malice
is
the
contrary
appetite
pity
then
is
related
to
benevolence
and
malice
to
anger
and
as
benevolence
has
been
already
found
to
be
connected
with
love
by
a
natural
and
original
quality
and
anger
with
hatred
it
is
by
this
chain
the
passions
of
pity
and
malice
are
connected
with
love
and
hatred
this
hypothesis
is
founded
on
sufficient
experience
a
man
who
from
any
motives
has
entertained
a
resolution
of
performing
an
action
naturally
runs
into
every
other
view
or
motive
which
may
fortify
that
resolution
and
give
it
authority
and
influence
on
the
mind
to
confirm
us
in
any
design
we
search
for
motives
drawn
from
interest
from
honour
from
duty
what
wonder
then
that
pity
and
benevolence
malice
and
anger
being
the
same
desires
arising
from
different
principles
should
so
totally
mix
together
as
to
be
undistinguishable
as
to
the
connexion
betwixt
benevolence
and
love
anger
and
hatred
being
original
and
primary
it
admits
of
no
difficulty
we
may
add
to
this
another
experiment
viz
that
benevolence
and
anger
and
consequently
love
and
hatred
arise
when
our
happiness
or
misery
have
any
dependance
on
the
happiness
or
misery
of
another
person
without
any
farther
relation
i
doubt
not
but
this
experiment
will
appear
so
singular
as
to
excuse
us
for
stopping
a
moment
to
consider
it
suppose
that
two
persons
of
the
same
trade
should
seek
employment
in
a
town
that
is
not
able
to
maintain
both
it
is
plain
the
success
of
one
is
perfectly
incompatible
with
that
of
the
other
and
that
whatever
is
for
the
interest
of
either
is
contrary
to
that
of
his
rival
and
so
vice
versa
suppose
again
that
two
merchants
though
living
in
different
parts
of
the
world
should
enter
into
together
the
advantage
or
loss
of
one
becomes
immediately
the
advantage
or
loss
of
his
partner
and
the
same
fortune
necessarily
attends
both
now
it
is
evident
that
in
the
first
case
hatred
always
follows
upon
the
contrariety
of
interests
as
in
the
second
love
arises
from
their
union
let
us
consider
to
what
principle
we
can
ascribe
these
passions
it
is
plain
they
arise
not
from
the
double
relations
of
impressions
and
ideas
if
we
regard
only
the
present
sensation
for
takeing
the
first
case
of
rivalship
though
the
pleasure
and
advantage
of
an
antagonist
necessarily
causes
my
pain
and
loss
yet
to
this
his
pain
and
loss
causes
my
pleasure
and
advantage
and
supposing
him
to
be
unsuccessful
i
may
by
this
means
receive
from
him
a
superior
degree
of
satisfaction
in
the
same
manner
the
success
of
a
partner
rejoices
me
but
then
his
misfortunes
afflict
me
in
an
equal
proportion
and
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
the
latter
sentiment
may
in
many
cases
preponderate
but
whether
the
fortune
of
a
rival
or
partner
be
good
or
bad
i
always
hate
the
former
and
love
the
latter
this
love
of
a
partner
can
not
proceed
from
the
relation
or
connexion
betwixt
us
in
the
same
manner
as
i
love
a
brother
or
countryman
a
rival
has
almost
as
close
a
relation
to
me
as
a
partner
for
as
the
pleasure
of
the
latter
causes
my
pleasure
and
his
pain
my
pain
so
the
pleasure
of
the
former
causes
my
pain
and
his
pain
my
pleasure
the
connexion
then
of
cause
and
effect
is
the
same
in
both
cases
and
if
in
the
one
case
the
cause
and
effect
have
a
farther
relation
of
resemblance
they
have
that
of
contrariety
in
the
other
which
being
also
a
species
of
resemblance
leaves
the
matter
pretty
equal
the
only
explication
then
we
can
give
of
this
phaenomenon
is
derived
from
that
principle
of
a
parallel
direction
our
concern
for
our
own
interest
gives
us
a
pleasure
in
the
pleasure
and
a
pain
in
the
pain
of
a
partner
after
the
same
manner
as
by
sympathy
we
feel
a
sensation
correspondent
to
those
which
appear
in
any
person
who
is
present
with
us
on
the
other
hand
the
same
concern
for
our
interest
makes
us
feel
a
pain
in
the
pleasure
and
a
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
a
rival
and
in
short
the
same
contrariety
of
sentiments
as
arises
from
comparison
and
malice
since
therefore
a
parallel
direction
of
the
affections
proceeding
from
interest
can
give
rise
to
benevolence
or
anger
no
wonder
the
same
parallel
direction
derived
from
sympathy
and
from
comparison
should
have
the
same
effect
in
general
we
may
observe
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
good
to
others
from
whatever
motive
without
feeling
some
touches
of
kindness
and
towards
them
as
the
injuries
we
do
not
only
cause
hatred
in
the
person
who
suffers
them
but
even
in
ourselves
these
phaenomena
indeed
may
in
part
be
accounted
for
from
other
principles
but
here
there
occurs
a
considerable
objection
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
examine
before
we
proceed
any
farther
i
have
endeavoured
to
prove
that
power
and
riches
or
poverty
and
meanness
which
give
rise
to
love
or
hatred
without
producing
any
original
pleasure
or
uneasiness
operate
upon
us
by
means
of
a
secondary
sensation
derived
from
a
sympathy
with
that
pain
or
satisfaction
which
they
produce
in
the
person
who
possesses
them
from
a
sympathy
with
his
pleasure
there
arises
love
from
that
with
his
uneasiness
hatred
but
it
is
a
maxim
which
i
have
just
now
established
and
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
explication
of
the
phaenomena
of
pity
and
malice
that
it
is
not
the
present
sensation
or
momentary
pain
or
pleasure
which
determines
the
character
of
any
passion
but
the
general
bent
or
tendency
of
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
for
this
reason
pity
or
a
sympathy
with
pain
produces
love
and
that
because
it
interests
us
in
the
fortunes
of
others
good
or
bad
and
gives
us
a
secondary
sensation
correspondent
to
the
primary
in
which
it
has
the
same
influence
with
love
and
benevolence
since
then
this
rule
holds
good
in
one
case
why
does
it
not
prevail
throughout
and
why
does
sympathy
in
uneasiness
ever
produce
any
passion
beside
and
kindness
is
it
becoming
a
philosopher
to
alter
his
method
of
reasoning
and
run
from
one
principle
to
its
contrary
according
to
the
particular
phaenomenon
which
he
would
explain
i
have
mentioned
two
different
causes
from
which
a
transition
of
passion
may
arise
viz
a
double
relation
of
ideas
and
impressions
and
what
is
similar
to
it
a
conformity
in
the
tendency
and
direction
of
any
two
desires
which
arise
from
different
principles
now
i
assert
that
when
a
sympathy
with
uneasiness
is
weak
it
produces
hatred
or
contempt
by
the
former
cause
when
strong
it
produces
love
or
tenderness
by
the
latter
this
is
the
solution
of
the
foregoing
difficulty
which
seems
so
urgent
and
this
is
a
principle
founded
on
such
evident
arguments
that
we
ought
to
have
established
it
even
though
it
were
not
necessary
to
the
explication
of
any
phaenomenon
it
is
certain
that
sympathy
is
not
always
limited
to
the
present
moment
but
that
we
often
feel
by
communication
the
pains
and
pleasures
of
others
which
are
not
in
being
and
which
we
only
anticipate
by
the
force
of
imagination
for
supposing
i
saw
a
person
perfectly
unknown
to
me
who
while
asleep
in
the
fields
was
in
danger
of
being
trod
under
foot
by
horses
i
should
immediately
run
to
his
assistance
and
in
this
i
should
be
actuated
by
the
same
principle
of
sympathy
which
makes
me
concerned
for
the
present
sorrows
of
a
stranger
the
bare
mention
of
this
is
sufficient
sympathy
being
nothing
but
a
lively
idea
converted
into
an
impression
it
is
evident
that
in
considering
the
future
possible
or
probable
condition
of
any
person
we
may
enter
into
it
with
so
vivid
a
conception
as
to
make
it
our
own
concern
and
by
that
means
be
sensible
of
pains
and
pleasures
which
neither
belong
to
ourselves
nor
at
the
present
instant
have
any
real
existence
but
however
we
may
look
forward
to
the
future
in
sympathizing
with
any
person
the
extending
of
our
sympathy
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
our
sense
of
his
present
condition
it
is
a
great
effort
of
imagination
to
form
such
lively
ideas
even
of
the
present
sentiments
of
others
as
to
feel
these
very
sentiments
but
it
is
impossible
we
coued
extend
this
sympathy
to
the
future
without
being
aided
by
some
circumstance
in
the
present
which
strikes
upon
us
in
a
lively
manner
when
the
present
misery
of
another
has
any
strong
influence
upon
me
the
vivacity
of
the
conception
is
not
confined
merely
to
its
immediate
object
but
diffuses
its
influence
over
all
the
related
ideas
and
gives
me
a
lively
notion
of
all
the
circumstances
of
that
person
whether
past
present
or
future
possible
probable
or
certain
by
means
of
this
lively
notion
i
am
interested
in
them
take
part
with
them
and
feel
a
sympathetic
motion
in
my
breast
conformable
to
whatever
i
imagine
in
his
if
i
diminish
the
vivacity
of
the
first
conception
i
diminish
that
of
the
related
ideas
as
pipes
can
convey
no
more
water
than
what
arises
at
the
fountain
by
this
diminution
i
destroy
the
future
prospect
which
is
necessary
to
interest
me
perfectly
in
the
fortune
of
another
i
may
feel
the
present
impression
but
carry
my
sympathy
no
farther
and
never
transfuse
the
force
of
the
first
conception
into
my
ideas
of
the
related
objects
if
it
be
another
misery
which
is
presented
in
this
feeble
manner
i
receive
it
by
communication
and
am
affected
with
all
the
passions
related
to
it
but
as
i
am
not
so
much
interested
as
to
concern
myself
in
his
good
fortune
as
well
as
his
bad
i
never
feel
the
extensive
sympathy
nor
the
passions
related
to
it
now
in
order
to
know
what
passions
are
related
to
these
different
kinds
of
sympathy
we
must
consider
that
benevolence
is
an
original
pleasure
arising
from
the
pleasure
of
the
person
beloved
and
a
pain
proceeding
from
his
pain
from
which
correspondence
of
impressions
there
arises
a
subsequent
desire
of
his
pleasure
and
aversion
to
his
pain
in
order
then
to
make
a
passion
run
parallel
with
benevolence
it
is
requisite
we
should
feel
these
double
impressions
correspondent
to
those
of
the
person
whom
we
consider
nor
is
any
one
of
them
alone
sufficient
for
that
purpose
when
we
sympathize
only
with
one
impression
and
that
a
painful
one
this
sympathy
is
related
to
anger
and
to
hatred
upon
account
of
the
uneasiness
it
conveys
to
us
but
as
the
extensive
or
limited
sympathy
depends
upon
the
force
of
the
first
sympathy
it
follows
that
the
passion
of
love
or
hatred
depends
upon
the
same
principle
a
strong
impression
when
communicated
gives
a
double
tendency
of
the
passions
which
is
related
to
benevolence
and
love
by
a
similarity
of
direction
however
painful
the
first
impression
might
have
been
a
weak
impression
that
is
painful
is
related
to
anger
and
hatred
by
the
resemblance
of
sensations
benevolence
therefore
arises
from
a
great
degree
of
misery
or
any
degree
strongly
sympathized
with
hatred
or
contempt
from
a
small
degree
or
one
weakly
sympathized
with
which
is
the
principle
i
intended
to
prove
and
explain
nor
have
we
only
our
reason
to
trust
to
for
this
principle
but
also
experience
a
certain
degree
of
poverty
produces
contempt
but
a
degree
beyond
causes
compassion
and
we
may
a
peasant
or
servant
but
when
the
misery
of
a
beggar
appears
very
great
or
is
painted
in
very
lively
colours
we
sympathize
with
him
in
his
afflictions
and
feel
in
our
heart
evident
touches
of
pity
and
benevolence
the
same
object
causes
contrary
passions
according
to
its
different
degrees
the
passions
therefore
must
depend
upon
principles
that
operate
in
such
certain
degrees
according
to
my
hypothesis
the
encrease
of
the
sympathy
has
evidently
the
same
effect
as
the
encrease
of
the
misery
a
barren
or
desolate
country
always
seems
ugly
and
disagreeable
and
commonly
inspires
us
with
contempt
for
the
inhabitants
this
deformity
however
proceeds
in
a
great
measure
from
a
sympathy
with
the
inhabitants
as
has
been
already
observed
but
it
is
only
a
weak
one
and
reaches
no
farther
than
the
immediate
sensation
which
is
disagreeable
the
view
of
a
city
in
ashes
conveys
benevolent
sentiments
because
we
there
enter
so
deep
into
the
interests
of
the
miserable
inhabitants
as
to
wish
for
their
prosperity
as
well
as
feel
their
adversity
but
though
the
force
of
the
impression
generally
produces
pity
and
benevolence
it
is
certain
that
by
being
carryed
too
far
it
ceases
to
have
that
effect
this
perhaps
may
be
worth
our
notice
when
the
uneasiness
is
either
small
in
itself
or
remote
from
us
it
engages
not
the
imagination
nor
is
able
to
convey
an
equal
concern
for
the
future
and
contingent
good
as
for
the
present
and
real
evil
upon
its
acquiring
greater
force
we
become
so
interested
in
the
concerns
of
the
person
as
to
be
sensible
both
of
his
good
and
had
fortune
and
from
that
compleat
sympathy
there
arises
pity
and
benevolence
but
it
will
easily
be
imagined
that
where
the
present
evil
strikes
with
more
than
ordinary
force
it
may
entirely
engage
our
attention
and
prevent
that
double
sympathy
thus
we
find
that
though
every
one
but
especially
women
are
apt
to
contract
a
kindness
for
criminals
who
go
to
the
scaffold
and
readily
imagine
them
to
be
uncommonly
handsome
and
wellshaped
yet
one
who
is
present
at
the
cruel
execution
of
the
rack
feels
no
such
tender
emotions
but
is
in
a
manner
overcome
with
horror
and
has
no
leisure
to
temper
this
uneasy
sensation
by
any
opposite
sympathy
but
the
instance
which
makes
the
most
clearly
for
my
hypothesis
is
that
wherein
by
a
change
of
the
objects
we
separate
the
double
sympathy
even
from
a
midling
degree
of
the
passion
in
which
case
we
find
that
pity
instead
of
producing
love
and
tenderness
as
usual
always
gives
rise
to
the
contrary
affection
when
we
observe
a
person
in
misfortunes
we
are
affected
with
pity
and
love
but
the
author
of
that
misfortune
becomes
the
object
of
our
strongest
hatred
and
is
the
more
detested
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
our
compassion
now
for
what
reason
should
the
same
passion
of
pity
produce
love
to
the
person
who
suffers
the
misfortune
and
hatred
to
the
person
who
causes
it
unless
it
be
because
in
the
latter
case
the
author
bears
a
relation
only
to
the
misfortune
whereas
in
considering
the
sufferer
we
carry
our
view
on
every
side
and
wish
for
his
prosperity
as
well
as
are
sensible
of
his
affliction
shall
just
observe
before
i
leave
the
present
subject
that
this
phaenomenon
of
the
double
sympathy
and
its
tendency
to
cause
love
may
contribute
to
the
production
of
the
kindness
which
we
naturally
bear
our
relations
and
acquaintance
custom
and
relation
make
us
enter
deeply
into
the
sentiments
of
others
and
whatever
fortune
we
suppose
to
attend
them
is
rendered
present
to
us
by
the
imagination
and
operates
as
if
originally
our
own
we
rejoice
in
their
pleasures
and
grieve
for
their
sorrows
merely
from
the
force
of
sympathy
nothing
that
concerns
them
is
indifferent
to
us
and
as
this
correspondence
of
sentiments
is
the
natural
attendant
of
love
it
readily
produces
that
affection
sect
x
of
respect
and
contempt
there
now
remains
only
to
explain
the
passion
of
respect
and
contempt
along
with
the
amorous
affection
in
order
to
understand
all
the
passions
which
have
any
mixture
of
love
or
hatred
let
us
begin
with
respect
and
contempt
in
considering
the
qualities
and
circumstances
of
others
we
may
either
regard
them
as
they
really
are
in
themselves
or
may
make
a
comparison
betwixt
them
and
our
own
qualities
and
circumstances
or
may
join
these
two
methods
of
consideration
the
good
qualities
of
others
from
the
first
point
of
view
produce
love
from
the
second
humility
and
from
the
third
respect
which
is
a
mixture
of
these
two
passions
their
bad
qualities
after
the
same
manner
cause
either
hatred
or
pride
or
contempt
according
to
the
light
in
which
we
survey
them
that
there
is
a
mixture
of
pride
in
contempt
and
of
humility
in
respect
is
i
think
too
evident
from
their
very
feeling
or
appearance
to
require
any
particular
proof
that
this
mixture
arises
from
a
tacit
comparison
of
the
person
contemned
or
respected
with
ourselves
is
no
less
evident
the
same
man
may
cause
either
respect
love
or
contempt
by
his
condition
and
talents
according
as
the
person
who
considers
him
from
his
inferior
becomes
his
equal
or
superior
in
changing
the
point
of
view
though
the
object
may
remain
the
same
its
proportion
to
ourselves
entirely
alters
which
is
the
cause
of
an
alteration
in
the
passions
these
passions
therefore
arise
from
our
observing
the
proportion
that
is
from
a
comparison
i
have
already
observed
that
the
mind
has
a
much
stronger
propensity
to
pride
than
to
humility
and
have
endeavoured
from
the
principles
of
human
nature
to
assign
a
cause
for
this
phaenomenon
whether
my
reasoning
be
received
or
not
the
phaenomenon
is
undisputed
and
appears
in
many
instances
among
the
rest
it
is
the
reason
why
there
is
a
much
greater
mixture
of
pride
in
contempt
than
of
humility
in
respect
and
why
we
are
more
elevated
with
the
view
of
one
below
us
than
mortifyed
with
the
presence
of
one
above
us
contempt
or
scorn
has
so
strong
a
tincture
of
pride
that
there
scarce
is
any
other
passion
discernable
whereas
in
esteem
or
respect
love
makes
a
more
considerable
ingredient
than
humility
the
passion
of
vanity
is
so
prompt
that
it
rouzes
at
the
least
call
while
humility
requires
a
stronger
impulse
to
make
it
exert
itself
but
here
it
may
reasonably
be
asked
why
this
mixture
takes
place
only
in
some
cases
and
appears
not
on
every
occasion
all
those
objects
which
cause
love
when
placed
on
another
person
are
the
causes
of
pride
when
transfered
to
ourselves
and
consequently
ought
to
be
causes
of
humility
as
well
as
love
while
they
belong
to
others
and
are
only
compared
to
those
which
we
ourselves
possess
in
like
manner
every
quality
which
by
being
directly
considered
produces
hatred
ought
always
to
give
rise
to
pride
by
comparison
and
by
a
mixture
of
these
passions
of
hatred
and
pride
ought
to
excite
contempt
or
scorn
the
difficulty
then
is
why
any
objects
ever
cause
pure
love
or
hatred
and
produce
not
always
the
mixt
passions
of
respect
and
contempt
i
have
supposed
all
along
that
the
passions
of
love
and
pride
and
those
of
humility
and
hatred
are
similar
in
their
sensations
and
that
the
two
former
are
always
agreeable
and
the
two
latter
painful
but
though
this
be
universally
true
it
is
observable
that
the
two
agreeable
as
well
as
the
two
painful
passions
have
some
difference
and
even
contrarieties
which
distinguish
them
nothing
invigorates
and
exalts
the
mind
equally
with
pride
and
vanity
though
at
the
same
time
love
or
tenderness
is
rather
found
to
weaken
and
infeeble
it
the
same
difference
is
observable
betwixt
the
uneasy
passions
anger
and
hatred
bestow
a
new
force
on
all
our
thoughts
and
actions
while
humility
and
shame
deject
and
discourage
us
of
these
qualities
of
the
passions
it
will
be
necessary
to
form
a
distinct
idea
let
us
remember
that
pride
and
hatred
invigorate
the
soul
and
love
and
humility
infeeble
it
from
this
it
follows
that
though
the
conformity
betwixt
love
and
hatred
in
the
agreeableness
of
their
sensation
makes
them
always
be
excited
by
the
same
objects
yet
this
other
contrariety
is
the
reason
why
they
are
excited
in
very
different
degrees
genius
and
learning
are
pleasant
and
magnificent
objects
and
by
both
these
circumstances
are
adapted
to
pride
and
vanity
but
have
a
relation
to
love
by
their
pleasure
only
ignorance
and
simplicity
are
disagreeable
and
mean
which
in
the
same
manner
gives
them
a
double
connexion
with
humility
and
a
single
one
with
hatred
we
may
therefore
consider
it
as
certain
that
though
the
same
object
always
produces
love
and
pride
humility
and
hatred
according
to
its
different
situations
yet
it
seldom
produces
either
the
two
former
or
the
two
latter
passions
in
the
same
proportion
it
is
here
we
must
seek
for
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
why
any
object
ever
excites
pure
love
or
hatred
and
does
not
always
produce
respect
or
contempt
by
a
mixture
of
humility
or
pride
no
quality
in
another
gives
rise
to
humility
by
comparison
unless
it
would
have
produced
pride
by
being
placed
in
ourselves
and
vice
versa
no
object
excites
pride
by
comparison
unless
it
would
have
produced
humility
by
the
direct
survey
this
is
evident
objects
always
produce
by
comparison
a
sensation
directly
contrary
to
their
original
one
suppose
therefore
an
object
to
be
presented
which
is
peculiarly
fitted
to
produce
love
but
imperfectly
to
excite
pride
this
object
belonging
to
another
gives
rise
directly
to
a
great
degree
of
love
but
to
a
small
one
of
humility
by
comparison
and
consequently
that
latter
passion
is
scarce
felt
in
the
compound
nor
is
able
to
convert
the
love
into
respect
this
is
the
case
with
good
nature
good
humour
facility
generosity
beauty
and
many
other
qualities
these
have
a
peculiar
aptitude
to
produce
love
in
others
but
not
so
great
a
tendency
to
excite
pride
in
ourselves
for
which
reason
the
view
of
them
as
belonging
to
another
person
produces
pure
love
with
but
a
small
mixture
of
humility
and
respect
it
is
easy
to
extend
the
same
reasoning
to
the
opposite
passions
before
we
leave
this
subject
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
account
for
a
pretty
curious
phaenomenon
viz
why
we
commonly
keep
at
a
distance
such
as
we
contemn
and
allow
not
our
inferiors
to
approach
too
near
even
in
place
and
situation
it
has
already
been
observed
that
almost
every
kind
of
idea
is
attended
with
some
emotion
even
the
ideas
of
number
and
extension
much
more
those
of
such
objects
as
are
esteemed
of
consequence
in
life
and
fix
our
attention
it
is
not
with
entire
indifference
we
can
survey
either
a
rich
man
or
a
poor
one
but
must
feel
some
faint
touches
at
least
of
respect
in
the
former
case
and
of
contempt
in
the
latter
these
two
passions
are
contrary
to
each
other
but
in
order
to
make
this
contrariety
be
felt
the
objects
must
be
someway
related
otherwise
the
affections
are
totally
separate
and
distinct
and
never
encounter
the
relation
takes
place
wherever
the
persons
become
contiguous
which
is
a
general
reason
why
we
are
uneasy
at
seeing
such
disproportioned
objects
as
a
rich
man
and
a
poor
one
a
nobleman
and
a
porter
in
that
situation
this
uneasiness
which
is
common
to
every
spectator
must
be
more
sensible
to
the
superior
and
that
because
the
near
approach
of
the
inferior
is
regarded
as
a
piece
of
and
shews
that
he
is
not
sensible
of
the
disproportion
and
is
no
way
affected
by
it
a
sense
of
superiority
in
another
breeds
in
all
men
an
inclination
to
keep
themselves
at
a
distance
from
him
and
determines
them
to
redouble
the
marks
of
respect
and
reverence
when
they
are
obliged
to
approach
him
and
where
they
do
not
observe
that
conduct
it
is
a
proof
they
are
not
sensible
of
his
superiority
from
hence
too
it
proceeds
that
any
great
difference
in
the
degrees
of
any
quality
is
called
a
distance
by
a
common
metaphor
which
however
trivial
it
may
appear
is
founded
on
natural
principles
of
the
imagination
a
great
difference
inclines
us
to
produce
a
distance
the
ideas
of
distance
and
difference
are
therefore
connected
together
connected
ideas
are
readily
taken
for
each
other
and
this
is
in
general
the
source
of
the
metaphor
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
afterwards
sect
xi
of
the
amorous
passion
or
love
betwixt
the
sexes
of
all
the
compound
passions
which
proceed
from
a
mixture
of
love
and
hatred
with
other
affections
no
one
better
deserves
our
attention
than
that
love
which
arises
betwixt
the
sexes
as
well
on
account
of
its
force
and
violence
as
those
curious
principles
of
philosophy
for
which
it
affords
us
an
uncontestable
argument
it
is
plain
that
this
affection
in
its
most
natural
state
is
derived
from
the
conjunction
of
three
different
impressions
or
passions
viz
the
pleasing
sensation
arising
from
beauty
the
bodily
appetite
for
generation
and
a
generous
kindness
or
the
origin
of
kindness
from
beauty
may
be
explained
from
the
foregoing
reasoning
the
question
is
how
the
bodily
appetite
is
excited
by
it
the
appetite
of
generation
when
confined
to
a
certain
degree
is
evidently
of
the
pleasant
kind
and
has
a
strong
connexion
with
all
the
agreeable
emotions
joy
mirth
vanity
and
kindness
are
all
incentives
to
this
desire
as
well
as
music
dancing
wine
and
good
cheer
on
the
other
hand
sorrow
melancholy
poverty
humility
are
destructive
of
it
from
this
quality
it
is
easily
conceived
why
it
should
be
connected
with
the
sense
of
beauty
but
there
is
another
principle
that
contributes
to
the
same
effect
i
have
observed
that
the
parallel
direction
of
the
desires
is
a
real
relation
and
no
less
than
a
resemblance
in
their
sensation
produces
a
connexion
among
them
that
we
may
fully
comprehend
the
extent
of
this
relation
we
must
consider
that
any
principal
desire
may
be
attended
with
subordinate
ones
which
are
connected
with
it
and
to
which
if
other
desires
are
parallel
they
are
by
that
means
related
to
the
principal
one
thus
hunger
may
oft
be
considered
as
the
primary
inclination
of
the
soul
and
the
desire
of
approaching
the
meat
as
the
secondary
one
since
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
satisfying
that
appetite
if
an
object
therefore
by
any
separate
qualities
inclines
us
to
approach
the
meat
it
naturally
encreases
our
appetite
as
on
the
contrary
whatever
inclines
us
to
set
our
victuals
at
a
distance
is
contradictory
to
hunger
and
diminishes
our
inclination
to
them
now
it
is
plain
that
beauty
has
the
first
effect
and
deformity
the
second
which
is
the
reason
why
the
former
gives
us
a
keener
appetite
for
our
victuals
and
the
latter
is
sufficient
to
disgust
us
at
the
most
savoury
dish
that
cookery
has
invented
all
this
is
easily
applicable
to
the
appetite
for
generation
from
these
two
relations
viz
resemblance
and
a
parallel
desire
there
arises
such
a
connexion
betwixt
the
sense
of
beauty
the
bodily
appetite
and
benevolence
that
they
become
in
a
manner
inseparable
and
we
find
from
experience
that
it
is
indifferent
which
of
them
advances
first
since
any
of
them
is
almost
sure
to
be
attended
with
the
related
affections
one
who
is
inflamed
with
lust
feels
at
least
a
momentary
kindness
towards
the
object
of
it
and
at
the
same
time
fancies
her
more
beautiful
than
ordinary
as
there
are
many
who
begin
with
kindness
and
esteem
for
the
wit
and
merit
of
the
person
and
advance
from
that
to
the
other
passions
but
the
most
common
species
of
love
is
that
which
first
arises
from
beauty
and
afterwards
diffuses
itself
into
kindness
and
into
the
bodily
appetite
kindness
or
esteem
and
the
appetite
to
generation
are
too
remote
to
unite
easily
together
the
one
is
perhaps
the
most
refined
passion
of
the
soul
the
other
the
most
gross
and
vulgar
the
love
of
beauty
is
placed
in
a
just
medium
betwixt
them
and
partakes
of
both
their
natures
from
whence
it
proceeds
that
it
is
so
singularly
fitted
to
produce
both
this
account
of
love
is
not
peculiar
to
my
system
but
is
unavoidable
on
any
hypothesis
the
three
affections
which
compose
this
passion
are
evidently
distinct
and
has
each
of
them
its
distinct
object
it
is
certain
therefore
that
it
is
only
by
their
relation
they
produce
each
other
but
the
relation
of
passions
is
not
alone
sufficient
it
is
likewise
necessary
there
should
be
a
relation
of
ideas
the
beauty
of
one
person
never
inspires
us
with
love
for
another
this
then
is
a
sensible
proof
of
the
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
from
one
instance
so
evident
as
this
we
may
form
a
judgment
of
the
rest
this
may
also
serve
in
another
view
to
illustrate
what
i
have
insisted
on
concerning
the
origin
of
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
i
have
observed
that
though
self
be
the
object
of
the
first
set
of
passions
and
some
other
person
of
the
second
yet
these
objects
can
not
alone
be
the
causes
of
the
passions
as
having
each
of
them
a
relation
to
two
contrary
affections
which
must
from
the
very
first
moment
destroy
each
other
here
then
is
the
situation
of
the
mind
as
i
have
already
described
it
it
has
certain
organs
naturally
fitted
to
produce
a
passion
that
passion
when
produced
naturally
turns
the
view
to
a
certain
object
but
this
not
being
sufficient
to
produce
the
passion
there
is
required
some
other
emotion
which
by
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
may
set
these
principles
in
action
and
bestow
on
them
their
first
impulse
this
situation
is
still
more
remarkable
with
regard
to
the
appetite
of
generation
sex
is
not
only
the
object
but
also
the
cause
of
the
appetite
we
not
only
turn
our
view
to
it
when
actuated
by
that
appetite
but
the
reflecting
on
it
suffices
to
excite
the
appetite
but
as
this
cause
loses
its
force
by
too
great
frequency
it
is
necessary
it
should
be
quickened
by
some
new
impulse
and
that
impulse
we
find
to
arise
from
the
beauty
of
the
person
that
is
from
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
since
this
double
relation
is
necessary
where
an
affection
has
both
a
distinct
cause
and
object
how
much
more
so
where
it
has
only
a
distinct
object
without
any
determinate
cause

to
pass
from
the

and
from
their
mixtures
and
compositions
as
they
appear
m
man
to
the
same
affections
as
they
display
themselves
in
brutes
we
may
observe
not
only
that
love
and
hatred
are
common
to
the
whole
sensitive
creation
but
likewise
that
their
causes
as
are
of
so
simple
a
nature
that
they
may
easily
be
supposed
to
operate
on
mere
animals
there
is
no
force
of
reflection
or
penetration
required
every
thing
is
conducted
by
springs
and
principles
which
are
not
peculiar
to
man
or
any
one
species
of
animals
the
conclusion
from
this
is
obvious
in
favour
of
the
foregoing
system
love
in
animals
has
not
for
its
only
object
animals
of
the
same
species
but
extends
itself
farther
and
comprehends
almost
every
sensible
and
thinking
being
a
dog
naturally
loves
a
man
above
his
own
species
and
very
commonly
meets
with
a
return
of
affection
as
animals
are
but
little
susceptible
either
of
the
pleasures
or
pains
of
the
imagination
they
can
judge
of
objects
only
by
the
sensible
good
or
evil
which
they
produce
and
from
that
must
regulate
their
affections
towards
them
accordingly
we
find
that
by
benefits
or
injuries
we
produce
their
love
or
hatred
and
that
by
feeding
and
cherishing
any
animal
we
quickly
acquire
his
affections
as
by
beating
and
abusing
him
we
never
fail
to
draw
on
us
his
enmity
and
love
in
beasts
is
not
caused
so
much
by
relation
as
in
our
species
and
that
because
their
thoughts
are
not
so
active
as
to
trace
relations
except
in
very
obvious
instances
yet
it
is
easy
to
remark
that
on
some
occasions
it
has
a
considerable
influence
upon
them
thus
acquaintance
which
has
the
same
effect
as
relation
always
produces
love
in
animals
either
to
men
or
to
each
other
for
the
same
reason
any
likeness
among
them
is
the
source
of
affection
an
ox
confined
to
a
park
with
horses
will
naturally
join
their
company
if
i
may
so
speak
but
always
leaves
it
to
enjoy
that
of
his
own
species
where
he
has
the
choice
of
both
the
affection
of
parents
to
their
young
proceeds
from
a
peculiar
instinct
in
animals
as
well
as
in
our
species
it
is
evident
that
sympathy
or
the
communication
of
passions
takes
place
among
animals
no
less
than
among
men
fear
anger
courage
and
other
affections
are
frequently
communicated
from
one
animal
to
another
without
their
knowledge
of
that
cause
which
produced
the
original
passion
grief
likewise
is
received
by
sympathy
and
produces
almost
all
the
same
consequences
and
excites
the
same
emotions
as
in
our
species
the
howlings
and
lamentations
of
a
dog
produce
a
sensible
concern
in
his
fellows
and
it
is
remarkable
that
though
almost
all
animals
use
in
play
the
same
member
and
nearly
the
same
action
as
in
fighting
a
lion
a
tyger
a
cat
their
paws
an
ox
his
horns
a
dog
his
teeth
a
horse
his
heels
yet
they
most
carefully
avoid
harming
their
companion
even
though
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
his
resentment
which
is
an
evident
proof
of
the
sense
brutes
have
of
each
other
pain
and
pleasure
every
one
has
observed
how
much
more
dogs
are
animated
when
they
hunt
in
a
pack
than
when
they
pursue
their
game
apart
and
it
is
evident
this
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
from
sympathy
it
is
also
well
known
to
hunters
that
this
effect
follows
in
a
greater
degree
and
even
in
too
great
a
degree
where
two
packs
that
are
strangers
to
each
other
are
joined
together
we
might
perhaps
be
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
phaenomenon
if
we
had
not
experience
of
a
similar
in
ourselves
envy
and
malice
are

remarkable

are

we
come

the

the

which
arise

and
though
properly
speaking

be
not
comprehended
among
the

yet
as
the
full
understanding
of
its
nature
and
properties
is
necessary
to
the
explanation
of
them
we
shall
here
make
it
the
subject
of
our
enquiry
i
desire
it
may
be
observed
that
by
the
will

nothing
but
the
internal
impression
we
feel
and
are
conscious
of
when
we
knowingly
give
rise
to
any
new
motion
of
our
body
or
new
perception
of
our
mind
this
impression
like
the
preceding
ones
of
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
it
is
impossible
to
define
and
needless
to
describe
any
farther
for
which
reason
we
shall
cut
off
all
those
definitions
and
distinctions
with
which
philosophers
are
wont
to
perplex
rather
than
dear
up
this
question
and
entering
at
first
upon
the
subject
shall
examine
that
long
disputed
question
concerning
liberty
and
necessity
which
occurs
so
naturally
in
treating
of
the
will
it
is
universally
acknowledged
that
the
operations
of
external
bodies
are
necessary
and
that
in
the
communication
of
their
motion
in
their
attraction
and
mutual
cohesion
there
are
nor
the
least
traces
of
indifference
or
liberty
every
object
is
determined
by
an
absolute
fate
toa
certain
degree
and
direction
of
irs
motion
and
can
no
more
depart
from
that
precise
line
in
which
it
moves
than
it
can
convert
itself
into
an
angel
or
spirit
or
any
superior
substance
the
actions
therefore
of
matter
are
to
be
regarded
as
instances
of
necessary
actions
and
whatever
is
in
this
respect
on
the
same
footing
with
matter
must
be
acknowledged
to
be
necessary
that
we
may
know
whether
this
be
the
case
with
the
actions
of
the
mind
we
shall
begin
with
examining
matter
and
considering
on
what
the
idea
of
a
necessity
in
its
operations
are
founded
and
why
we
conclude
one
body
or
action
to
be
the
infallible
cause
of
another
it
has
been
observed
already
that
in
no
single
instance
the
ultimate
connexion
of
any
objects
is
discoverable
either
by
our
senses
or
reason
and
that
we
can
never
penetrate
so
far
into
the
essence
and
construction
of
bodies
as
to
perceive
the
principle
on
which
their
mutual
influence
depends
it
is
their
constant
union
alone
with
which
we
are
acquainted
and
it
is
from
the
constant
union
the
necessity
arises
if
objects
had
nor
an
uniform
and
regular
conjunction
with
each
other
we
should
never
arrive
at
any
idea
of
cause
and
effect
and
even
after
all
the
necessity
which
enters
into
that
idea
is
nothing
but
a
determination
of
the
mind
to
pass
from
one
object
to
its
usual
attendant
and
infer
the
existence
of
one
from
that
of
the
other
here
then
are
two
particulars
which
we
are
to
consider
as
essential
to
necessity
viz
the
constant
union
and
the
inference
of
the
mind
and
wherever
we
discover
these
we
must
acknowledge
a
necessity
as
the
actions
of
matter
have
no
necessity
but
what
is
derived
from
these
circumstances
and
it
is
not
by
any
insight
into
the
essence
of
bodies
we
discover
their
connexion
the
absence
of
this
insight
while
the
union
and
inference
remain
will
never
in
any
case
remove
the
necessity
it
is
the
observation
of
the
union
which
produces
the
inference
for
which
reason
it
might
be
thought
sufficient
if
we
prove
a
constant
union
in
the
actions
of
the
mind
in
order
to
establish
the
inference
along
with
the
necessity
of
these
actions
but
that
i
may
bestow
a
greater
force
on
my
reasoning
i
shall
examine
these
particulars
apart
and
shall
first
prove
from
experience
that
our
actions
have
a
constant
union
with
our
motives
tempers
and
circumstances
before
i
consider
the
inferences
we
draw
from
it
to
this
end
a
very
slight
and
general
view
of
the
common
course
of
human
affairs
will
be
sufficient
there
is
no
light
in
which
we
can
take
them
that
does
nor
confirm
this
principle
whether
we
consider
mankind
according
to
the
difference
of
sexes
ages
governments
conditions
or
methods
of
education
the
same
uniformity
and
regular
operation
of
natural
principles
are
discernible
uke
causes
still
produce
like
effects
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
mutual
action
of
the
elements
and
powers
of
nature
there
are
different
trees
which
regularly
produce
fruit
whose
relish
is
different
from
each
other
and
this
regularity
will
be
admitted
as
an
instance
of
necessity
and
causes
in
external
bodies
but
are
the
products
of
guienne
and
of
champagne
more
regularly
different
than
the
sentiments
actions
and
passions
of
the
two
sexes
of
which
the
one
are
distinguished
by
their
force
and
maturity
the
other
by
their
delicacy
and
softness
are
the
changes
of
our
body
from
infancy
to
old
age
more
regular
and
certain
than
those
of
our
mind
and
conduct
and
would
a
man
be
more
ridiculous
who
would
expect
that
an
infant
of
four
years
old
will
raise
a
weight
of
three
hundred
pound
than
one
who
from
a
person
of
the
same
age
would
look
for
a
philosophical
reasoning
or
a
prudent
and
action
we
must
certainly
allow
that
the
cohesion
of
the
parts
of
matter
arises
from
natural
and
necessary
principles
whatever
difficulty
we
may
find
in
explaining
them
and
for
a
reason
we
must
allow
that
human
society
is
founded
on
like
principles
and
our
reason
in
the
latter
case
is
better
than
even
that
in
the
former
because
we
not
only
observe
that
men
always
seek
society
but
can
also
explain
the
principles
on
which
this
universal
propensity
is
founded
for
is
it
more
certain
that
two
flat
pieces
of
marble
will
unite
together
than
that
two
young
savages
of
different
sexes
will
copulate
do
the
children
arise
from
this
copulation
more
uniformly
than
does
the
parents
care
for
their
safety
and
preservation
and
after
they
have
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
by
the
care
of
their
parents
are
the
inconveniencies
attending
their
separation
more
certain
than
their
foresight
of
these
inconveniencies
and
their
care
of
avoiding
them
by
a
close
union
and
confederacy
the
skin
pores
muscles
and
nerves
of
a
are
different
from
those
of
a
man
of
quality
so
are
his
sentiments
actions
and
manners
the
different
stations
of
life
influence
the
whole
fabric
external
and
internal
and
different
stations
arise
necessarily
because
uniformly
from
the
necessary
and
uniform
principles
of
human
nature
men
can
not
live
without
society
and
can
not
be
associated
without
government
government
makes
a
distinction
of
property
and
establishes
the
different
ranks
of
men
this
produces
industry
traffic
manufactures
war
leagues
alliances
voyages
travels
cities
fleets
ports
and
all
those
other
actions
and
objects
which
cause
such
a
diversity
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
such
an
uniformity
in
human
life
should
a
traveller
returning
from
a
far
country
tell
us
that
he
had
seen
a
climate
in
the
fiftieth
degree
of
northern
latitude
where
all
the
fruits
ripen
and
come
to
perfection
in
the
winter
and
decay
in
the
summer
after
the
same
manner
as
in
england
they
are
produced
and
decay
in
the
contrary
seasons
he
would
find
few
so
credulous
as
to
believe
him
i
am
apt
to
think
a
travellar
would
meet
with
as
little
credit
who
should
inform
us
of
people
exactly
of
the
same
character
with
those
in
plato
republic
on
the
one
hand
or
those
in
hobbes
leviathan
on
the
other
there
is
a
general
course
of
nature
in
human
actions
as
well
as
in
the
operations
of
the
sun
and
the
climate
there
are
also
characters
peculiar
to
different
nations
and
particular
persons
as
well
as
common
to
mankind
the
knowledge
of
these
characters
is
founded
on
the
observation
of
an
uniformity
in
the
actions
that
flow
from
them
and
this
uniformity
forms
the
very
essence
of
necessity
i
can
imagine
only
one
way
of
eluding
this
argument
which
is
by
denying
that
uniformity
of
human
actions
on
which
it
is
founded
as
long
as
actions
have
a
constant
union
and
connexion
with
the
situation
and
temper
of
the
agent
however
we
may
in
words
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
necessity
we
really
allow
the
thing
now
some
may
perhaps
find
a
pretext
to
deny
this
regular
union
and
connexion
for
what
is
more
capricious
than
human
actions
what
more
inconstant
than
the
desires
of
man
and
what
creature
departs
more
widely
not
only
from
right
reason
but
from
his
own
character
and
disposition
an
hour
a
moment
is
sufficient
to
make
him
change
from
one
extreme
to
another
and
overturn
what
cost
the
greatest
pain
and
labour
to
establish
necessity
is
regular
and
certain
human
conduct
is
irregular
and
uncertain
the
one
therefore
proceeds
not
from
the
other
to
this
i
reply
that
in
judging
of
the
actions
of
men
we
must
proceed
upon
the
same
maxims
as
when
we
reason
concerning
external
objects
when
any
phaenomena
are
constantly
and
invariably
conjoined
together
they
acquire
such
a
connexion
in
the
imagination
that
it
passes
from
one
to
the
other
without
any
doubt
or
hesitation
but
below
this
there
are
many
inferior
degrees
of
evidence
and
probability
nor
does
one
single
contrariety
of
experiment
entirely
destroy
all
our
reasoning
the
mind
ballances
the
contrary
experiments
and
deducting
the
inferior
from
the
superior
proceeds
with
that
degree
of
assurance
or
evidence
which
remains
even
when
these
contrary
experiments
are
entirely
equal
we
remove
not
the
notion
of
causes
and
necessity
but
supposing
that
the
usual
contrariety
proceeds
from
the
operation
of
contrary
and
concealed
causes
we
conclude
that
the
chance
or
indifference
lies
only
in
our
judgment
on
account
of
our
imperfect
knowledge
not
in
the
things
themselves
which
are
in
every
case
equally
necessary
though
to
appearance
not
equally
constant
or
certain
no
union
can
be
more
constant
and
certain
than
that
of
some
actions
with
some
motives
and
characters
and
if
in
other
cases
the
union
is
uncertain
it
is
no
more
than
what
happens
in
the
operations
of
body
nor
can
we
conclude
any
thing
from
the
one
irregularity
which
will
not
follow
equally
from
the
other
it
is
commonly
allowed
that
have
no
liberty
but
were
we
to
judge
by
their
actions
these
have
less
regularity
and
constancy
than
the
actions
of
and
consequently
are
farther
removed
from
necessity
our
way
of
thinking
in
this
particular
is
therefore
absolutely
inconsistent
but
is
a
natural
consequence
of
these
confused
ideas
and
undefined
terms
which
we
so
commonly
make
use
of
in
our
reasonings
especially
on
the
present
subject
we
must
now
shew
that
as
the
union
betwixt
motives
and
actions
has
the
same
constancy
as
that
in
any
natural
operations
so
its
influence
on
the
understanding
is
also
the
same
in
determining
us
to
infer
the
existence
of
one
from
that
of
another
if
this
shall
appear
there
is
no
known
circumstance
that
enters
into
the
connexion
and
production
of
the
actions
of
matter
that
is
not
to
be
found
in
all
the
operations
of
the
mind
and
consequently
we
can
not
without
a
manifest
absurdity
attribute
necessity
to
the
one
and
refuse
into
the
other
there
is
no
philosopher
whose
judgment
is
so
riveted
to
this
fantastical
system
of
liberty
as
not
to
acknowledge
the
force
of
moral
evidence
and
both
in
speculation
and
practice
proceed
upon
it
as
upon
a
reasonable
foundation
now
moral
evidence
is
nothing
but
a
conclusion
concerning
the
actions
of
men
derived
from
the
consideration
of
their
motives
temper
and
situation
thus
when
we
see
certain
characters
or
figures
described
upon
paper
we
infer
that
the
person
who
produced
them
would
affirm
such
facts
the
death
of
caesar
the
success
of
augustus
the
cruelty
of
nero
and
remembering
many
other
concurrent
testimonies
we
conclude
that
those
facts
were
once
really
existant
and
that
so
many
men
without
any
interest
would
never
conspire
to
deceive
us
especially
since
they
must
in
the
attempt
expose
themselves
to
the
derision
of
all
their
contemporaries
when
these
facts
were
asserted
to
be
recent
and
universally
known
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
runs
through
politics
war
commerce
economy
and
indeed
mixes
itself
so
entirely
in
human
life
that
it
is
impossible
to
act
or
subsist
a
moment
without
having
recourse
to
it
a
prince
who
imposes
a
tax
upon
his
subjects
expects
their
compliance
a
general
who
conducts
an
army
makes
account
of
a
certain
degree
of
courage
a
merchant
looks
for
fidelity
and
skill
in
his
factor
or
a
man
who
gives
orders
for
his
dinner
doubts
not
of
the
obedience
of
his
servants
in
short
as
nothing
more
nearly
interests
us
than
our
own
actions
and
those
of
others
the
greatest
part
of
our
reasonings
is
employed
in
judgments
concerning
them
now
i
assert
that
whoever
reasons
after
this
manner
does
ipso
facto
believe
the
actions
of
the
will
to
arise
from
necessity
and
that
he
knows
not
what
he
means
when
he
denies
it
all
those
objects
of
which
we
call
the
one
cause
and
the
other
effect
considered
in
themselves
are
as
distinct
and
separate
from
each
other
as
any
two
things
in
nature
nor
can
we
ever
by
the
most
accurate
survey
of
them
infer
the
existence
of
the
one
from
that
of
the
other
it
is
only
from
experience
and
the
observation
of
their
constant
union
that
we
are
able
to
form
this
inference
and
even
after
all
the
inference
is
nothing
but
the
effects
of
custom
on
the
imagination
we
must
not
here
be
content
with
saying
that
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
arises
from
objects
constantly
united
but
must
affirm
that
it
is
the
very
same
with
the
idea
of
those
objects
and
that
the
necessary
connexion
is
not
discovered
by
a
conclusion
of
the
understanding
but
is
merely
a
perception
of
the
mind
wherever
therefore
we
observe
the
same
union
and
wherever
the
union
operates
in
the
same
manner
upon
the
belief
and
opinion
we
have
the
idea
of
causes
and
necessity
though
perhaps
we
may
avoid
those
expressions
motion
in
one
body
in
all
past
instances
that
have
fallen
under
our
observation
is
followed
upon
impulse
by
motion
in
another
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
to
penetrate
farther
from
this
constant
union
it
forms
the
idea
of
cause
and
effect
and
by
its
influence
feels
the
necessity
as
there
is
the
same
constancy
and
the
same
influence
in
what
we
call
moral
evidence
i
ask
no
more
what
remains
can
only
be
a
dispute
of
words
and
indeed
when
we
consider
how
aptly
natural
and
moral
evidence
cement
together
and
form
only
one
chain
of
argument
betwixt
them
we
shall
make
no
scruple
to
allow
that
they
are
of
the
same
nature
and
derived
from
the
same
principles
a
prisoner
who
has
neither
money
nor
interest
discovers
the
impossibility
of
his
escape
as
well
from
the
obstinacy
of
the
goaler
as
from
the
walls
and
bars
with
which
he
is
surrounded
and
in
all
attempts
for
his
freedom
chuses
rather
to
work
upon
the
stone
and
iron
of
the
one
than
upon
the
inflexible
nature
of
the
other
the
same
prisoner
when
conducted
to
the
scaffold
foresees
his
death
as
certainly
from
the
constancy
and
fidelity
of
his
guards
as
from
the
operation
of
the
ax
or
wheel
his
mind
runs
along
a
certain
train
of
ideas
the
refusal
of
the
soldiers
to
consent
to
his
escape
the
action
of
the
executioner
the
separation
of
the
head
and
body
bleeding
convulsive
motions
and
death
here
is
a
connected
chain
of
natural
causes
and
voluntary
actions
but
the
mind
feels
no
difference
betwixt
them
in
passing
from
one
link
to
another
nor
is
less
certain
of
the
future
event
than
if
it
were
connected
with
the
present
impressions
of
the
memory
and
senses
by
a
train
of
causes
cemented
together
by
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
a
physical
necessity
the
same
experienced
union
has
the
same
effect
on
the
mind
whether
the
united
objects
be
motives
volitions
and
actions
or
figure
and
motion
we
may
change
the
names
of
things
but
their
nature
and
their
operation
on
the
understanding
never
change
i
dare
be
positive
no
one
will
ever
endeavour
to
refute
these
reasonings
otherwise
than
by
altering
my
definitions
and
assigning
a
different
meaning
to
the
terms
of
cause
and
effect
and
necessity
and
liberty
and
chance
according
to
my
definitions
necessity
makes
an
essential
part
of
causation
and
consequently
liberty
by
removing
necessity
removes
also
causes
and
is
the
very
same
thing
with
chance
as
chance
is
commonly
thought
to
imply
a
contradiction
and
is
at
least
directly
contrary
to
experience
there
are
always
the
same
arguments
against
liberty
or
if
any
one
alters
the
definitions
i
can
not
pretend
to
argue
with
him
until
i
know
the
meaning
he
assigns
to
these
terms
sect
ii
the
same
subject
continued
i
believe
we
may
assign
the
three
following
reasons
for
the
prevalance
of
the
doctrine
of
liberty
however
absurd
it
may
be
in
one
sense
and
unintelligible
in
any
other
first
after
we
have
performed
any
action
though
we
confess
we
were
influenced
by
particular
views
and
motives
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
persuade
ourselves
we
were
governed
by
necessity
and
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
us
to
have
acted
otherwise
the
idea
of
necessity
seeming
to
imply
something
of
force
and
violence
and
constraint
of
which
we
are
not
sensible
few
are
capable
of
distinguishing
betwixt
the
liberty
of
spontaniety
as
it
is
called
in
the
schools
and
the
liberty
of
indifference
betwixt
that
which
is
opposed
to
violence
and
that
which
means
a
negation
of
necessity
and
causes
the
first
is
even
the
most
common
sense
of
the
word
and
as
it
is
only
that
species
of
liberty
which
it
concerns
us
to
preserve
our
thoughts
have
been
principally
turned
towards
it
and
have
almost
universally
confounded
it
with
the
other
secondly
there
is
a
false
sensation
or
experience
even
of
the
liberty
of
indifference
which
is
regarded
as
an
argument
for
its
real
existence
the
necessity
of
any
action
whether
of
matter
or
of
the
mind
is
not
properly
a
quality
in
the
agent
but
in
any
thinking
or
intelligent
being
who
may
consider
the
action
and
consists
in
the
determination
of
his
thought
to
infer
its
existence
from
some
preceding
objects
as
liberty
or
chance
on
the
other
hand
is
nothing
but
the
want
of
that
determination
and
a
certain
looseness
which
we
feel
in
passing
or
not
passing
from
the
idea
of
one
to
that
of
the
other
now
we
may
observe
that
though
in
reflecting
on
human
actions
we
seldom
feel
such
a
looseness
or
indifference
yet
it
very
commonly
happens
that
in
performing
the
actions
themselves
we
are
sensible
of
something
like
it
and
as
all
related
or
resembling
objects
are
readily
taken
for
each
other
this
has
been
employed
as
a
demonstrative
or
even
an
intuitive
proof
of
human
liberty
we
feel
that
our
actions
are
subject
to
our
will
on
most
occasions
and
imagine
we
feel
that
the
will
itself
is
subject
to
nothing
because
when
by
a
denial
of
it
we
are
provoked
to
try
we
feel
that
it
moves
easily
every
way
and
produces
an
image
of
itself
even
on
that
side
on
which
it
did
not
settle
this
image
or
faint
motion
we
persuade
ourselves
coued
have
been
compleated
into
the
thing
itself
because
should
that
be
denyed
we
find
upon
a
second
trial
that
it
can
but
these
efforts
are
all
in
vain
and
whatever
capricious
and
irregular
actions
we
may
perform
as
the
desire
of
showing
our
liberty
is
the
sole
motive
of
our
actions
we
can
never
free
ourselves
from
the
bonds
of
necessity
we
may
imagine
we
feel
a
liberty
within
ourselves
but
a
spectator
can
commonly
infer
our
actions
from
our
motives
and
character
and
even
where
he
can
not
he
concludes
in
general
that
he
might
were
he
perfectly
acquainted
with
every
circumstance
of
our
situation
and
temper
and
the
most
secret
springs
of
our
complexion
and
disposition
now
this
is
the
very
essence
of
necessity
according
to
the
foregoing
doctrine
a
third
reason
why
the
doctrine
of
liberty
has
generally
been
better
received
in
the
world
than
its
antagonist
proceeds
from
religion
which
has
been
very
unnecessarily
interested
in
this
question
there
is
no
method
of
reasoning
more
common
and
yet
none
more
blameable
than
in
philosophical
debates
to
endeavour
to
refute
any
hypothesis
by
a
pretext
of
its
dangerous
consequences
to
religion
and
morality
when
any
opinion
leads
us
into
absurdities
it
is
certainly
false
but
it
is
not
certain
an
opinion
is
false
because
it
is
of
dangerous
consequence
such
topics
therefore
ought
entirely
to
be
foreborn
as
serving
nothing
to
the
discovery
of
truth
but
only
to
make
the
person
of
an
antagonist
odious
this
i
observe
in
general
without
pretending
to
draw
any
advantage
from
it
i
submit
myself
frankly
to
an
examination
of
this
kind
and
dare
venture
to
affirm
that
the
doctrine
of
necessity
according
to
my
explication
of
it
is
not
only
innocent
but
even
advantageous
to
religion
and
morality
i
define
necessity
two
ways
conformable
to
the
two
definitions
of
cause
of
which
it
makes
an
essential
part
i
place
it
either
in
the
constant
union
and
conjunction
of
like
objects
or
in
the
inference
of
the
mind
from
the
one
to
the
other
now
necessity
in
both
these
senses
has
universally
though
tacitely
in
the
schools
in
the
pulpit
and
in
common
life
been
allowed
to
belong
to
the
will
of
man
and
no
one
has
ever
pretended
to
deny
that
we
can
draw
inferences
concerning
human
actions
and
that
those
inferences
are
founded
on
the
experienced
union
of
like
actions
with
like
motives
and
circumstances
the
only
particular
in
which
any
one
can
differ
from
me
is
either
that
perhaps
he
will
refuse
to
call
this
necessity
but
as
long
as
the
meaning
is
understood
i
hope
the
word
can
do
no
harm
or
that
he
will
maintain
there
is
something
else
in
the
operations
of
matter
now
whether
it
be
so
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
to
religion
whatever
it
may
be
to
natural
philosophy
i
may
be
mistaken
in
asserting
that
we
have
no
idea
of
any
other
connexion
in
the
actions
of
body
and
shall
be
glad
to
be
farther
instructed
on
that
head
but
sure
i
am
i
ascribe
nothing
to
the
actions
of
the
mind
but
what
must
readily
be
allowed
of
let
no
one
therefore
put
an
invidious
construction
on
my
words
by
saying
simply
that
i
assert
the
necessity
of
human
actions
and
place
them
on
the
same
footing
with
the
operations
of
senseless
matter
i
do
not
ascribe
to
the
will
that
unintelligible
necessity
which
is
supposed
to
lie
in
matter
but
i
ascribe
to
matter
that
intelligible
quality
call
it
necessity
or
not
which
the
most
rigorous
orthodoxy
does
or
must
allow
to
belong
to
the
will
i
change
therefore
nothing
in
the
received
systems
with
regard
to
the
will
but
only
with
regard
to
material
objects
nay
i
shall
go
farther
and
assert
that
this
kind
of
necessity
is
so
essential
to
religion
and
morality
that
without
it
there
must
ensue
an
absolute
subversion
of
both
and
that
every
other
supposition
is
entirely
destructive
to
all
laws
both
divine
and
human
it
is
indeed
certain
that
as
all
human
laws
are
founded
on
rewards
and
punishments
it
is
supposed
as
a
fundamental
principle
that
these
motives
have
an
influence
on
the
mind
and
both
produce
the
good
and
prevent
the
evil
actions
we
may
give
to
this
influence
what
name
we
please
but
as
it
is
usually
conjoined
with
the
action
common
sense
requires
it
should
be
esteemed
a
cause
and
be
booked
upon
as
an
instance
of
that
necessity
which
i
would
establish
this
reasoning
is
equally
solid
when
applied
to
divine
laws
so
far
as
the
deity
is
considered
as
a
legislator
and
is
supposed
to
inflict
punishment
and
bestow
rewards
with
a
design
to
produce
obedience
but
i
also
maintain
that
even
where
he
acts
not
in
his
magisterial
capacity
but
is
regarded
as
the
avenger
of
crimes
merely
on
account
of
their
odiousness
and
deformity
not
only
it
is
impossible
without
the
necessary
connexion
of
cause
and
effect
in
human
actions
that
punishments
coued
be
inflicted
compatible
with
justice
and
moral
equity
but
also
that
it
coued
ever
enter
into
the
thoughts
of
any
reasonable
being
to
inflict
them
the
constant
and
universal
object
of
hatred
or
anger
is
a
person
or
creature
endowed
with
thought
and
consciousness
and
when
any
criminal
or
injurious
actions
excite
that
passion
it
is
only
by
their
relation
to
the
person
or
connexion
with
him
but
according
to
the
doctrine
of
liberty
or
chance
this
connexion
is
reduced
to
nothing
nor
are
men
more
accountable
for
those
actions
which
are
designed
and
premeditated
than
for
such
as
are
the
most
casual
and
accidental
actions
are
by
their
very
nature
temporary
and
perishing
and
where
they
proceed
not
from
some
cause
in
the
characters
and
disposition
of
the
person
who
performed
them
they
infix
not
themselves
upon
him
and
can
neither
redound
to
his
honour
if
good
nor
infamy
if
evil
the
action
itself
may
be
blameable
it
may
be
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
morality
and
religion
but
the
person
is
not
responsible
for
it
and
as
it
proceeded
from
nothing
in
him
that
is
durable
or
constant
and
leaves
nothing
of
that
nature
behind
it
it
is
impossible
he
can
upon
its
account
become
the
object
of
punishment
or
vengeance
according
to
the
hypothesis
of
liberty
therefore
a
man
is
as
pure
and
untainted
after
having
committed
the
most
horrid
crimes
as
at
the
first
moment
of
his
birth
nor
is
his
character
any
way
concerned
in
his
actions
since
they
are
not
derived
from
it
and
the
wickedness
of
the
one
can
never
be
used
as
a
proof
of
the
depravity
of
the
other
it
is
only
upon
the
principles
of
necessity
that
a
person
acquires
any
merit
or
demerit
from
his
actions
however
the
common
opinion
may
incline
to
the
contrary
but
so
inconsistent
are
men
with
themselves
that
though
they
often
assert
that
necessity
utterly
destroys
all
merit
and
demerit
either
towards
mankind
or
superior
powers
yet
they
continue
still
to
reason
upon
these
very
principles
of
necessity
in
all
their
judgments
concerning
this
matter
men
are
not
blamed
for
such
evil
actions
as
they
perform
ignorantly
and
casually
whatever
may
be
their
consequences
why
but
because
the
causes
of
these
actions
are
only
momentary
and
terminate
in
them
alone
men
are
less
blamed
for
such
evil
actions
as
they
perform
hastily
and
unpremeditately
than
for
such
as
proceed
from
thought
and
deliberation
for
what
reason
but
because
a
hasty
temper
though
a
constant
cause
in
the
mind
operates
only
by
intervals
and
infects
not
the
whole
character
again
repentance
wipes
off
every
crime
especially
if
attended
with
an
evident
reformation
of
life
and
manners
how
is
this
to
be
accounted
for
but
by
asserting
that
actions
render
a
person
criminal
merely
as
they
are
proofs
of
criminal
passions
or
principles
in
the
mind
and
when
by
any
alteration
of
these
principles
they
cease
to
be
just
proofs
they
likewise
cease
to
be
criminal
but
according
to
the
doctrine
of
liberty
or
chance
they
never
were
just
proofs
and
consequently
never
were
criminal
here
then
i
turn
to
my
adversary
and
desire
him
to
free
his
own
system
from
these
odious
consequences
before
he
charge
them
upon
others
or
if
he
rather
chuses
that
this
question
should
be
decided
by
fair
arguments
before
philosophers
than
by
declamations
before
the
people
let
him
return
to
what
i
have
advanced
to
prove
that
liberty
and
chance
are
synonimous
and
concerning
the
nature
of
moral
evidence
and
the
regularity
of
human
actions
upon
a
review
of
these
reasonings
i
can
not
doubt
of
an
entire
victory
and
therefore
having
proved
that
all
actions
of
the
will
have
particular
causes
i
proceed
to
explain
what
these
causes
are
and
how
they
operate
sect
iii
of
the
influencing
motives
of
the
will
nothing
is
more
usual
in
philosophy
and
even
in
common
life
than
to
talk
of
the
combat
of
passion
and
reason
to
give
the
preference
to
reason
and
assert
that
men
are
only
so
far
virtuous
as
they
conform
themselves
to
its
dictates
every
rational
creature
it
is
said
is
obliged
to
regulate
his
actions
by
reason
and
if
any
other
motive
or
principle
challenge
the
direction
of
his
conduct
he
ought
to
oppose
it
till
it
be
entirely
subdued
or
at
least
brought
to
a
conformity
with
that
superior
principle
on
this
method
of
thinking
the
greatest
part
of
moral
philosophy
antient
and
modern
seems
to
be
founded
nor
is
there
an
ampler
field
as
well
for
metaphysical
arguments
as
popular
declamations
than
this
supposed
of
reason
above
passion
the
eternity
invariableness
and
divine
origin
of
the
former
have
been
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
the
blindness
unconstancy
and
deceitfulness
of
the
latter
have
been
as
strongly
insisted
on
in
order
to
shew
the
fallacy
of
all
this
philosophy
i
shall
endeavour
to
prove
first
that
reason
alone
can
never
be
a
motive
to
any
action
of
the
will
and
secondly
that
it
can
never
oppose
passion
in
the
direction
of
the
will
the
understanding
exerts
itself
after
two
different
ways
as
it
judges
from
demonstration
or
probability
as
it
regards
the
abstract
relations
of
our
ideas
or
those
relations
of
objects
of
which
experience
only
gives
us
information
i
believe
it
scarce
will
be
asserted
that
the
first
species
of
reasoning
alone
is
ever
the
cause
of
any
action
as
its
proper
province
is
the
world
of
ideas
and
as
the
will
always
places
us
in
that
of
realities
demonstration
and
volition
seem
upon
that
account
to
be
totally
removed
from
each
other
mathematics
indeed
are
useful
in
all
mechanical
operations
and
arithmetic
in
almost
every
art
and
profession
but
it
is
not
of
themselves
they
have
any
influence
mechanics
are
the
art
of
regulating
the
motions
of
bodies
to
some
designed
end
or
purpose
and
the
reason
why
we
employ
arithmetic
in
fixing
the
proportions
of
numbers
is
only
that
we
may
discover
the
proportions
of
their
influence
and
operation
a
merchant
is
desirous
of
knowing
the
sum
total
of
his
accounts
with
any
person
why
but
that
he
may
learn
what
sum
will
have
the
same
effects
in
paying
his
debt
and
going
to
market
as
all
the
particular
articles
taken
together
abstract
or
demonstrative
reasoning
therefore
never
influences
any
of
our
actions
but
only
as
it
directs
our
judgment
concerning
causes
and
effects
which
leads
us
to
the
second
operation
of
the
understanding
it
is
obvious
that
when
we
have
the
prospect
of
pain
or
pleasure
from
any
object
we
feel
a
consequent
emotion
of
aversion
or
propensity
and
are
carryed
to
avoid
or
embrace
what
will
give
us
this
uneasines
or
satisfaction
it
is
also
obvious
that
this
emotion
rests
not
here
but
making
us
cast
our
view
on
every
side
comprehends
whatever
objects
are
connected
with
its
original
one
by
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
here
then
reasoning
takes
place
to
discover
this
relation
and
according
as
our
reasoning
varies
our
actions
receive
a
subsequent
variation
but
it
is
evident
in
this
case
that
the
impulse
arises
not
from
reason
but
is
only
directed
by
it
it
is
from
the
prospect
of
pain
or
pleasure
that
the
aversion
or
propensity
arises
towards
any
object
and
these
emotions
extend
themselves
to
the
causes
and
effects
of
that
object
as
they
are
pointed
out
to
us
by
reason
and
experience
it
can
never
in
the
least
concern
us
to
know
that
such
objects
are
causes
and
such
others
effects
if
both
the
causes
and
effects
be
indifferent
to
us
where
the
objects
themselves
do
not
affect
us
their
connexion
can
never
give
them
any
influence
and
it
is
plain
that
as
reason
is
nothing
but
the
discovery
of
this
connexion
it
can
not
be
by
its
means
that
the
objects
are
able
to
affect
us
since
reason
alone
can
never
produce
any
action
or
give
rise
to
volition
i
infer
that
the
same
faculty
is
as
incapable
of
preventing
volition
or
of
disputing
the
preference
with
any
passion
or
emotion
this
consequence
is
necessary
it
is
impossible
reason
coued
have
the
latter
effect
of
preventing
volition
but
by
giving
an
impulse
in
a
contrary
direction
to
our
passion
and
that
impulse
had
it
operated
alone
would
have
been
able
to
produce
volition
nothing
can
oppose
or
retard
the
impulse
of
passion
but
a
contrary
impulse
and
if
this
contrary
impulse
ever
arises
from
reason
that
latter
faculty
must
have
an
original
influence
on
the
will
and
must
be
able
to
cause
as
well
as
hinder
any
act
of
volition
but
if
reason
has
no
original
influence
it
is
impossible
it
can
withstand
any
principle
which
has
such
an
efficacy
or
ever
keep
the
mind
in
suspence
a
moment
thus
it
appears
that
the
principle
which
opposes
our
passion
can
not
be
the
same
with
reason
and
is
only
called
so
in
an
improper
sense
we
speak
not
strictly
and
philosophically
when
we
talk
of
the
combat
of
passion
and
of
reason
reason
is
and
ought
only
to
be
the
slave
of
the
passions
and
can
never
pretend
to
any
other
office
than
to
serve
and
obey
them
as
this
opinion
may
appear
somewhat
extraordinary
it
may
not
be
improper
to
confirm
it
by
some
other
considerations
a
passion
is
an
original
existence
or
if
you
will
modification
of
existence
and
contains
not
any
representative
quality
which
renders
it
a
copy
of
any
other
existence
or
modification
when
i
am
angry
i
am
actually
possest
with
the
passion
and
in
that
emotion
have
no
more
a
reference
to
any
other
object
than
when
i
am
thirsty
or
sick
or
more
than
five
foot
high
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
this
passion
can
be
opposed
by
or
be
contradictory
to
truth
and
reason
since
this
contradiction
consists
in
the
disagreement
of
ideas
considered
as
copies
with
those
objects
which
they
represent
what
may
at
first
occur
on
this
head
is
that
as
nothing
can
be
contrary
to
truth
or
reason
except
what
has
a
reference
to
it
and
as
the
judgments
of
our
understanding
only
have
this
reference
it
must
follow
that
passions
can
be
contrary
to
reason
only
so
far
as
they
are
accompanyed
with
some
judgment
or
opinion
according
to
this
principle
which
is
so
obvious
and
natural
it
is
only
in
two
senses
that
any
affection
can
be
called
unreasonable
first
when
a
passion
such
as
hope
or
fear
grief
or
joy
despair
or
security
is
founded
on
the
supposition
or
the
existence
of
objects
which
really
do
not
exist
secondly
when
in
exerting
any
passion
in
action
we
chuse
means
insufficient
for
the
designed
end
and
deceive
ourselves
in
our
judgment
of
causes
and
effects
where
a
passion
is
neither
founded
on
false
suppositions
nor
chuses
means
insufficient
for
the
end
the
understanding
can
neither
justify
nor
condemn
it
it
is
not
contrary
to
reason
to
prefer
the
destruction
of
the
whole
world
to
the
scratching
of
my
finger
it
is
not
contrary
to
reason
for
me
to
chuse
my
total
ruin
to
prevent
the
least
uneasiness
of
an
indian
or
person
wholly
unknown
to
me
it
is
as
little
contrary
to
reason
to
prefer
even
my
own
acknowledgeed
lesser
good
to
my
greater
and
have
a
more
ardent
affection
for
the
former
than
the
latter
a
trivial
good
may
from
certain
circumstances
produce
a
desire
superior
to
what
arises
from
the
greatest
and
most
valuable
enjoyment
nor
is
there
any
thing
more
extraordinary
in
this
than
in
mechanics
to
see
one
pound
weight
raise
up
a
hundred
by
the
advantage
of
its
situation
in
short
a
passion
must
be
accompanyed
with
some
false
judgment
in
order
to
its
being
unreasonable
and
even
then
it
is
not
the
passion
properly
speaking
which
is
unreasonable
but
the
judgment
the
consequences
are
evident
since
a
passion
can
never
in
any
sense
be
called
unreasonable
but
when
founded
on
a
false
supposition
or
when
it
chuses
means
insufficient
for
the
designed
end
it
is
impossible
that
reason
and
passion
can
ever
oppose
each
other
or
dispute
for
the
government
of
the
will
and
actions
the
moment
we
perceive
the
falshood
of
any
supposition
or
the
insufficiency
of
any
means
our
passions
yield
to
our
reason
without
any
opposition
i
may
desire
any
fruit
as
of
an
excellent
relish
but
whenever
you
convince
me
of
my
mistake
my
longing
ceases
i
may
will
the
performance
of
certain
actions
as
means
of
obtaining
any
desired
good
but
as
my
willing
of
these
actions
is
only
secondary
and
founded
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
causes
of
the
proposed
effect
as
soon
as
i
discover
the
falshood
of
that
supposition
they
must
become
indifferent
to
me
it
is
natural
for
one
that
does
not
examine
objects
with
a
strict
philosophic
eye
to
imagine
that
those
actions
of
the
mind
are
entirely
the
same
which
produce
not
a
different
sensation
and
are
not
immediately
distinguishable
to
the
feeling
and
perception
reason
for
instance
exerts
itself
without
producing
any
sensible
emotion
and
except
in
the
more
sublime
disquisitions
of
philosophy
or
in
the
frivolous
subtilties
of
the
school
scarce
ever
conveys
any
pleasure
or
uneasiness
hence
it
proceeds
that
every
action
of
the
mind
which
operates
with
the
same
calmness
and
tranquillity
is
confounded
with
reason
by
all
those
who
judge
of
things
from
the
first
view
and
appearance
now
it
is
certain
there
are
certain
calm
desires
and
tendencies
which
though
they
be
real
passions
produce
little
emotion
in
the
mind
and
are
more
known
by
their
effects
than
by
the
immediate
feeling
or
sensation
these
desires
are
of
two
kinds
either
certain
instincts
originally
implanted
in
our
natures
such
as
benevolence
and
resentment
the
love
of
life
and
kindness
to
children
or
the
general
appetite
to
good
and
aversion
to
evil
considered
merely
as
such
when
any
of
these
passions
are
calm
and
cause
no
disorder
in
the
soul
they
are
very
readily
taken
for
the
determinations
of
reason
and
are
supposed
to
proceed
from
the
same
faculty
with
that
which
judges
of
truth
and
falshood
their
nature
and
principles
have
been
supposed
the
same
because
their
sensations
are
not
evidently
different
beside
these
calm
passions
which
often
determine
the
will
there
are
certain
violent
emotions
of
the
same
kind
which
have
likewise
a
great
influence
on
that
faculty
when
i
receive
any
injury
from
another
i
often
feel
a
violent
passion
of
resentment
which
makes
me
desire
his
evil
and
punishment
independent
of
all
considerations
of
pleasure
and
advantage
to
myself
when
i
am
immediately
threatened
with
any
grievous
ill
my
fears
apprehensions
and
aversions
rise
to
a
great
height
and
produce
a
sensible
emotion
the
common
error
of
metaphysicians
has
lain
in
ascribing
the
direction
of
the
will
entirely
to
one
of
these
principles
and
supposing
the
other
to
have
no
influence
men
often
act
knowingly
against
their
interest
for
which
reason
the
view
of
the
greatest
possible
good
does
not
always
influence
them
men
often
a
violent
passion
in
prosecution
of
their
interests
and
designs
it
is
not
therefore
the
present
uneasiness
alone
which
determines
them
in
general
we
may
observe
that
both
these
principles
operate
on
the
will
and
where
they
are
contrary
that
either
of
them
prevails
according
to
the
general
character
or
present
disposition
of
the
person
what
we
call
strength
of
mind
implies
the
prevalence
of
the
calm
passions
above
the
violent
though
we
may
easily
observe
there
is
no
man
so
constantly
possessed
of
this
virtue
as
never
on
any
occasion
to
yield
to
the
sollicitations
of
passion
and
desire
from
these
variations
of
temper
proceeds
the
great
difficulty
of
deciding
concerning
the
actions
and
resolutions
of
men
where
there
is
any
contrariety
of
motives
and
passions
sect
iv
of
the
causes
of
the
violent
passions
there
is
philosophy
a
subject
of
more
nice
speculation
than
this
of
the
different
causes
and
effects
of
the
calm
and
violent
passions
it
is
evident
passions
influence
not
the
will
in
proportion
to
their
violence
or
the
disorder
they
occasion
in
the
temper
but
on
the
contrary
that
when
a
passion
has
once
become
a
settled
principle
of
action
and
is
the
predominant
inclination
of
the
soul
it
commonly
produces
no
longer
any
sensible
agitation
as
repeated
custom
and
its
own
force
have
made
every
thing
yield
to
it
it
directs
the
actions
and
conduct
without
that
opposition
and
emotion
which
so
naturally
attend
every
momentary
gust
of
passion
we
must
therefore
distinguish
betwixt
a
calm
and
a
weak
passion
betwixt
a
violent
and
a
strong
one
but
notwithstanding
this
it
is
certain
that
when
we
would
govern
a
man
and
push
him
to
any
action
it
will
commonly
be
better
policy
to
work
upon
the
violent
than
the
calm
passions
and
rather
take
him
by
his
inclination
than
what
is
vulgarly
called
his
reason
we
ought
to
place
the
object
in
such
particular
situations
as
are
proper
to
encrease
the
violence
of
the
passion
for
we
may
observe
that
all
depends
upon
the
situation
of
the
object
and
that
a
variation
in
this
particular
will
be
able
to
change
the
calm
and
the
violent
passions
into
each
other
both
these
kinds
of
passions
pursue
good
and
avoid
evil
and
both
of
them
are
encreased
or
diminished
by
the
encrease
or
diminution
of
the
good
or
evil
but
herein
lies
the
difference
betwixt
them
the
same
good
when
near
will
cause
a
violent
passion
which
when
remote
produces
only
a
calm
one
as
this
subject
belongs
very
properly
to
the
present
question
concerning
the
will
we
shall
here
examine
it
to
the
bottom
and
shall
consider
some
of
those
circumstances
and
situations
of
objects
which
render
a
passion
either
calm
or
violent
it
is
a
remarkable
property
of
human
nature
that
any
emotion
which
attends
a
passion
is
easily
converted
into
it
though
in
their
natures
they
be
originally
different
from
and
even
contrary
to
each
other
it
is
true
in
order
to
make
a
perfect
union
among
passions
there
is
always
required
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
nor
is
one
relation
sufficient
for
that
purpose
but
though
this
be
confirmed
by
undoubted
experience
we
must
understand
it
with
its
proper
limitations
and
must
regard
the
double
relation
as
requisite
only
to
make
one
passion
produce
another
when
two
passions
are
already
produced
by
their
separate
causes
and
are
both
present
in
the
mind
they
readily
mingle
and
unite
though
they
have
but
one
relation
and
sometimes
without
any
the
predominant
passion
swallows
up
the
inferior
and
converts
it
into
itself
the
spirits
when
once
excited
easily
receive
a
change
in
their
direction
and
it
is
natural
to
imagine
this
change
will
come
from
the
prevailing
affection
the
connexion
is
in
many
respects
closer
betwixt
any
two
passions
than
betwixt
any
passion
and
indifference
when
a
person
is
once
heartily
in
love
the
little
faults
and
caprices
of
his
mistress
the
jealousies
and
quarrels
to
which
that
commerce
is
so
subject
however
unpleasant
and
related
to
anger
and
hatred
are
yet
found
to
give
additional
force
to
the
prevailing
passion
it
is
a
common
artifice
of
politicians
when
they
would
affect
any
person
very
much
by
a
matter
of
fact
of
which
they
intend
to
inform
him
first
to
excite
his
curiosity
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
satisfying
it
and
by
that
means
raise
his
anxiety
and
impatience
to
the
utmost
before
they
give
him
a
full
insight
into
the
business
they
know
that
his
curiosity
will
precipitate
him
into
the
passion
they
design
to
raise
and
assist
the
object
in
its
influence
on
the
mind
a
soldier
advancing
to
the
battle
is
naturally
inspired
with
courage
and
confidence
when
he
thinks
on
his
friends
and
and
is
struck
with
fear
and
terror
when
he
reflects
on
the
enemy
whatever
new
emotion
therefore
proceeds
from
the
former
naturally
encreases
the
courage
as
the
same
emotion
proceeding
from
the
latter
augments
the
fear
by
the
relation
of
ideas
and
the
conversion
of
the
inferior
emotion
into
the
predominant
hence
it
is
that
in
martial
discipline
the
uniformity
and
lustre
of
our
habit
the
regularity
of
our
figures
and
motions
with
all
the
pomp
and
majesty
of
war
encourage
ourselves
and
allies
while
the
same
objects
in
the
enemy
strike
terror
into
us
though
agreeable
and
beautiful
in
themselves
since
passions
however
independent
are
naturally
transfused
into
each
other
if
they
are
both
present
at
the
same
time
it
follows
that
when
good
or
evil
is
placed
in
such
a
situation
as
to
cause
any
particular
emotion
beside
its
direct
passion
of
desire
or
aversion
that
latter
passion
must
acquire
new
force
and
violence
this
happens
among
other
cases
whenever
any
object
excites
contrary
passions
for
it
is
observable
that
an
opposition
of
passions
commonly
causes
a
new
emotion
in
the
spirits
and
produces
more
disorder
than
the
concurrence
of
any
two
affections
of
equal
force
this
new
emotion
is
easily
converted
into
the
predominant
passion
and
encreases
its
violence
beyond
the
pitch
it
would
have
arrived
at
had
it
met
with
no
opposition
hence
we
naturally
desire
what
is
forbid
and
take
a
pleasure
in
performing
actions
merely
because
they
are
unlawful
the
notion
of
duty
when
opposite
to
the
passions
is
seldom
able
to
overcome
them
and
when
it
fails
of
that
effect
is
apt
rather
to
encrease
them
by
producing
an
opposition
in
our
motives
and
principles
the
same
effect
follows
whether
the
opposition
arises
from
internal
motives
or
external
obstacles
the
passion
commonly
acquires
new
force
and
violence
in
both
cases
the
efforts
which
the
mind
makes
to
surmount
the
obstacle
excite
the
spirits
and
inliven
the
passion
uncertainty
has
the
same
influence
as
opposition
the
agitation
of
the
thought
the
quick
turns
it
makes
from
one
view
to
another
the
variety
of
passions
which
succeed
each
other
according
to
the
different
views
all
these
produce
an
agitation
in
the
mind
and
transfuse
themselves
into
the
predominant
passion
there
is
not
in
my
opinion
any
other
natural
cause
why
security
diminishes
the
passions
than
because
it
removes
that
uncertainty
which
encreases
them
the
mind
when
left
to
itself
immediately
languishes
and
in
order
to
preserve
its
ardour
must
be
every
moment
supported
by
a
new
flow
of
passion
for
the
same
reason
despair
though
contrary
to
security
has
a
like
influence
it
is
certain
nothing
more
powerfully
animates
any
affection
than
to
conceal
some
part
of
its
object
by
throwing
it
into
a
kind
of
shade
which
at
the
same
time
that
it
chews
enough
to
us
in
favour
of
the
object
leaves
still
some
work
for
the
imagination
besides
that
obscurity
is
always
attended
with
a
kind
of
uncertainty
the
effort
which
the
fancy
makes
to
compleat
the
idea
rouzes
the
spirits
and
gives
an
additional
force
to
the
passion
as
despair
and
security
though
contrary
to
each
other
produce
the
same
effects
so
absence
is
observed
to
have
contrary
effects
and
in
different
circumstances
either
encreases
or
diminishes
our
affections
the
duc
de
la
rochefoucault
has
very
well
observed
that
absence
destroys
weak
passions
but
encreases
strong
as
the
wind
extinguishes
a
candle
but
blows
up
a
fire
long
absence
naturally
weakens
our
idea
and
diminishes
the
passion
but
where
the
idea
is
so
strong
and
lively
as
to
support
itself
the
uneasiness
arising
from
absence
encreases
the
passion
and
gives
it
new
force
and
violence
sect
v
of
the
effects
of
custom
but
nothing
has
a
greater
effect
both
to
encrease
and
diminish
our
passions
to
convert
pleasure
into
pain
and
pain
into
pleasure
than
custom
and
repetition
custom
has
two
original
effects
upon
the
mind
in
bestowing
a
facility
in
the
performance
of
any
action
or
the
conception
of
any
object
and
afterwards
a
tendency
or
inclination
towards
it
and
from
these
we
may
account
for
all
its
other
effects
however
extraordinary
when
the
soul
applies
itself
to
the
performance
of
any
action
or
the
conception
of
any
object
to
which
it
is
not
accustomed
there
is
a
certain
unpliableness
in
the
faculties
and
a
difficulty
of
the
moving
in
their
new
direction
as
this
difficulty
excites
the
spirits
it
is
the
source
of
wonder
surprize
and
of
all
the
emotions
which
arise
from
novelty
and
is
in
itself
very
agreeable
like
every
thing
which
inlivens
the
mind
to
a
moderate
degree
but
though
surprize
be
agreeable
in
itself
yet
as
it
puts
the
spirits
in
agitation
it
not
only
augments
our
agreeable
affections
but
also
our
painful
according
to
the
foregoing
principle
that
every
emotion
which
precedes
or
attends
a
passion
is
easily
converted
into
it
hence
every
thing
that
is
new
is
most
affecting
and
gives
us
either
more
pleasure
or
pain
than
what
strictly
speaking
naturally
belongs
to
it
when
it
often
returns
upon
us
the
novelty
wears
off
the
passions
subside
the
hurry
of
the
spirits
is
over
and
we
survey
the
objects
with
greater
tranquillity
by
degrees
the
repetition
produces
a
facility
of
the
human
mind
and
an
infallible
source
of
pleasure
where
the
facility
goes
not
beyond
a
certain
degree
and
here
it
is
remarkable
that
the
pleasure
which
arises
from
a
moderate
facility
has
not
the
same
tendency
with
that
which
arises
from
novelty
to
augment
the
painful
as
well
as
the
agreeable
affections
the
pleasure
of
facility
does
not
so
much
consist
in
any
ferment
of
the
spirits
as
in
their
orderly
motion
which
will
sometimes
be
so
powerful
as
even
to
convert
pain
into
pleasure
and
give
us
a
relish
in
time
what
at
first
was
most
harsh
and
disagreeable
but
again
as
facility
converts
pain
into
pleasure
so
it
often
converts
pleasure
into
pain
when
it
is
too
great
and
renders
the
actions
of
the
mind
so
faint
and
languid
that
they
are
no
longer
able
to
interest
and
support
it
and
indeed
scarce
any
other
objects
become
disagreeable
through
custom
but
such
as
are
naturally
attended
with
some
emotion
or
affection
which
is
destroyed
by
the
too
frequent
repetition
one
can
consider
the
clouds
and
heavens
and
trees
and
stones
however
frequently
repeated
without
ever
feeling
any
aversion
but
when
the
fair
sex
or
music
or
good
cheer
or
any
thing
that
naturally
ought
to
be
agreeable
becomes
indifferent
it
easily
produces
the
opposite
affection
but
custom
not
only
gives
a
facility
to
perform
any
action
but
likewise
an
inclination
and
tendency
towards
it
where
it
is
not
entirely
disagreeable
and
can
never
be
the
object
of
inclination
and
this
is
the
reason
why
custom
encreases
all
active
habits
but
diminishes
passive
according
to
the
observation
of
a
late
eminent
philosopher
the
facility
takes
off
from
the
force
of
the
passive
habits
by
rendering
the
motion
of
the
spirits
faint
and
languid
but
as
in
the
active
the
spirits
are
sufficiently
supported
of
themselves
the
tendency
of
the
mind
gives
them
new
force
and
bends
them
more
strongly
to
the
action
sect
vi
of
the
influence
of
the
imagination
on
the
passions
it
is
remarkable
that
the
imagination
and
affections
have
close
union
together
and
that
nothing
which
affects
the
former
can
be
entirely
indifferent
to
the
latter
wherever
our
ideas
of
good
or
evil
acquire
a
new
vivacity
the
passions
become
more
violent
and
keep
pace
with
the
imagination
in
all
its
variations
whether
this
proceeds
from
the
principle
that
any
attendant
emotion
is
easily
converted
into
the
predominant
i
shall
not
determine
it
is
sufficient
for
my
present
purpose
that
we
have
many
instances
to
confirm
this
influence
of
the
imagination
upon
the
passions
any
pleasure
with
which
we
are
acquainted
affects
us
more
than
any
other
which
we
own
to
be
superior
but
of
whose
nature
we
are
wholly
ignorant
of
the
one
we
can
form
a
particular
and
determinate
idea
the
other
we
conceive
under
the
general
notion
of
pleasure
and
it
is
certain
that
the
more
general
and
universal
any
of
our
ideas
are
the
less
influence
they
have
upon
the
imagination
a
general
idea
though
it
be
nothing
but
a
particular
one
considered
in
a
certain
view
is
commonly
more
obscure
and
that
because
no
particular
idea
by
which
we
represent
a
general
one
is
ever
fixed
or
determinate
but
may
easily
be
changed
for
other
particular
ones
which
will
serve
equally
in
the
representation
there
is
a
noted
passage
in
the
history
of
greece
which
may
serve
for
our
present
purpose
themistocles
told
the
athenians
that
he
had
formed
a
design
which
would
be
highly
useful
to
the
public
but
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
communicate
to
them
without
ruining
the
execution
since
its
success
depended
entirely
on
the
secrecy
with
which
it
should
be
conducted
the
athenians
instead
of
granting
him
full
power
to
act
as
he
thought
fitting
ordered
him
to
communicate
his
design
to
aristides
in
whose
prudence
they
had
an
entire
confidence
and
whose
opinion
they
were
resolved
blindly
to
submit
to
the
design
of
themistocles
was
secretly
to
set
fire
to
the
fleet
of
all
the
grecian
commonwealths
which
was
assembled
in
a
neighbouring
port
and
which
being
once
destroyed
would
give
the
athenians
the
empire
of
the
sea
without
any
rival
aristides
returned
to
the
assembly
and
told
them
that
nothing
coued
be
more
advantageous
than
the
design
of
themistocles
but
at
the
same
time
that
nothing
coued
be
more
unjust
upon
which
the
people
unanimously
rejected
the
project
a
late
celebrated
historian
mons
rollin
charles
rollin
histoire
ancienne
paris
admires
this
passage
of
antient
history
as
one
of
the
most
singular
that
is
any
where
to
be
met
here
says
he
they
are
not
philosophers
to
whom
it
is
easy
in
their
schools
to
establish
the
finest
maxims
and
most
sublime
rules
of
morality
who
decide
that
interest
ought
never
to
prevail
above
justice
it
is
a
whole
people
interested
in
the
proposal
which
is
made
to
them
who
consider
it
as
of
importance
to
the
public
good
and
who
notwithstanding
reject
it
unanimously
and
without
hesitation
merely
because
it
is
contrary
to
justice
for
my
part
i
see
nothing
so
extraordinary
in
this
proceeding
of
the
athenians
the
same
reasons
which
render
it
so
easy
for
philosophers
to
establish
these
sublime
maxims
tend
in
part
to
diminish
the
merit
of
such
a
conduct
in
that
people
philosophers
never
ballance
betwixt
profit
and
honesty
because
their
decisions
are
general
and
neither
their
passions
nor
imaginations
are
interested
in
the
objects
and
though
in
the
present
case
the
advantage
was
immediate
to
the
athenians
yet
as
it
was
known
only
under
the
general
notion
of
advantage
without
being
conceived
by
any
particular
idea
it
must
have
had
a
less
considerable
influence
on
their
imaginations
and
have
been
a
less
violent
temptation
than
if
they
had
been
acquainted
with
all
its
circumstances
otherwise
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
a
whole
people
unjust
and
violent
as
men
commonly
are
should
so
unanimously
have
adhered
to
justice
and
rejected
any
considerable
advantage
any
satisfaction
which
we
lately
enjoyed
and
of
which
the
memory
is
fresh
and
recent
operates
on
the
will
with
more
violence
than
another
of
which
the
traces
are
decayed
and
almost
obliterated
from
whence
does
this
proceed
but
that
the
memory
in
the
first
case
assists
the
fancy
and
gives
an
additional
force
and
vigour
to
its
conceptions
the
image
of
the
past
pleasure
being
strong
and
violent
bestows
these
qualities
on
the
idea
of
the
future
pleasure
which
is
connected
with
it
by
the
relation
of
resemblance
a
pleasure
which
is
suitable
to
the
way
of
life
in
which
we
are
engaged
excites
more
our
desires
and
appetites
than
another
which
is
foreign
to
it
this
phaenomenon
may
be
explained
from
the
same
principle
nothing
is
more
capable
of
infusing
any
passion
into
the
mind
than
eloquence
by
which
objects
are
represented
in
their
strongest
and
most
lively
colours
we
may
of
ourselves
acknowledge
that
such
an
object
is
valuable
and
such
another
odious
but
until
an
orator
excites
the
imagination
and
gives
force
to
these
ideas
they
may
have
but
a
feeble
influence
either
on
the
will
or
the
affections
but
eloquence
is
not
always
necessary
the
bare
opinion
of
another
especially
when
inforced
with
passion
will
cause
an
idea
of
good
or
evil
to
have
an
influence
upon
us
which
would
otherwise
have
been
entirely
neglected
this
proceeds
from
the
principle
of
sympathy
or
communication
and
sympathy
as
i
have
already
observed
is
nothing
but
the
conversion
of
an
idea
into
an
impression
by
the
force
of
imagination
it
is
remarkable
that
lively
passions
commonly
attend
a
lively
imagination
in
this
respect
as
well
as
others
the
force
of
the
passion
depends
as
much
on
the
temper
of
the
person
as
the
nature
or
situation
of
the
object
i
have
already
observed
that
belief
is
nothing
but
a
lively
idea
related
to
a
present
impression
this
vivacity
is
a
requisite
circumstance
to
the
exciting
all
our
passions
the
calm
as
well
as
the
violent
nor
has
a
mere
fiction
of
the
imagination
any
considerable
influence
upon
either
of
them
it
is
too
weak
to
take
hold
of
the
mind
or
be
attended
with
emotion
sect
vii
of
contiguity
and
distance
in
space
and
time
there
is
an
easy
reason
why
every
thing
contiguous
to
us
either
in
space
or
time
should
be
conceived
with
a
peculiar
force
and
vivacity
and
excel
every
other
object
in
its
influence
on
the
imagination
ourself
is
intimately
present
to
us
and
whatever
is
related
to
self
must
partake
of
that
quality
but
where
an
object
is
so
far
removed
as
to
have
lost
the
advantage
of
this
relation
why
as
it
is
farther
removed
its
idea
becomes
still
fainter
and
more
obscure
would
perhaps
require
a
more
particular
examination
it
is
obvious
that
the
imagination
can
never
totally
forget
the
points
of
space
and
time
in
which
we
are
existent
but
receives
such
frequent
advertisements
of
them
from
the
passions
and
senses
that
however
it
may
turn
its
attention
to
foreign
and
remote
objects
it
is
necessitated
every
moment
to
reflect
on
the
present
iot
is
also
remarkable
that
in
the
conception
of
those
objects
which
we
regard
as
real
and
existent
we
take
them
in
their
proper
order
and
situation
and
never
leap
from
one
object
to
another
which
is
distant
from
it
without
running
over
at
least
in
a
cursory
manner
all
those
objects
which
are
interposed
betwixt
them
when
we
reflect
therefore
on
any
object
distant
from
ourselves
we
are
obliged
not
only
to
reach
it
at
first
by
passing
through
all
the
intermediate
space
betwixt
ourselves
and
the
object
but
also
to
renew
our
progress
every
moment
being
every
moment
recalled
to
the
consideration
of
ourselves
and
our
present
situation
it
is
easily
conceived
that
this
interruption
must
weaken
the
idea
by
breaking
the
action
of
the
mind
and
hindering
the
conception
from
being
so
intense
and
continued
as
when
we
reflect
on
a
nearer
object
the
fewer
steps
we
make
to
arrive
at
the
object
and
the
smoother
the
road
is
this
diminution
of
vivacity
is
less
sensibly
felt
but
still
may
be
observed
more
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
degrees
of
distance
and
difficulty
here
then
we
are
to
consider
two
kinds
of
objects
the
contiguous
and
remote
of
which
the
former
by
means
of
their
relation
to
ourselves
approach
an
impression
in
force
and
vivacity
the
latter
by
reason
of
the
interruption
in
our
manner
of
conceiving
them
appear
in
a
weaker
and
more
imperfect
light
this
is
their
effect
on
the
imagination
if
my
reasoning
be
just
they
must
have
a
proportionable
effect
on
the
will
and
passions
contiguous
objects
must
have
an
influence
much
superior
to
the
distant
and
remote
accordingly
we
find
in
common
life
that
men
are
principally
concerned
about
those
objects
which
are
not
much
removed
either
in
space
or
time
enjoying
the
present
and
leaving
what
is
afar
off
to
the
care
of
chance
and
fortune
talk
to
a
man
of
his
condition
thirty
years
hence
and
he
will
not
regard
you
speak
of
what
is
to
happen
tomorrow
and
he
will
lend
you
attention
the
breaking
of
a
mirror
gives
us
more
concern
when
at
home
than
the
burning
of
a
house
when
abroad
and
some
hundred
leagues
distant
but
farther
though
distance
both
in
space
and
time
has
a
considerable
effect
on
the
imagination
and
by
that
means
on
the
will
and
passions
yet
the
consequence
of
a
removal
in
space
are
much
inferior
to
those
of
a
removal
in
time
twenty
years
are
certainly
but
a
small
distance
of
time
in
comparison
of
what
history
and
even
the
memory
of
some
may
inform
them
of
and
yet
i
doubt
if
a
thousand
leagues
or
even
the
greatest
distance
of
place
this
globe
can
admit
of
will
so
remarkably
weaken
our
ideas
and
diminish
our
passions
a
merchant
will
tell
you
that
he
is
not
without
concern
about
what
passes
in
jamaica
though
few
extend
their
views
so
far
into
futurity
as
to
dread
very
remote
accidents
the
cause
of
this
phaenomenon
must
evidently
lie
in
the
different
properties
of
space
and
time
without
having
recourse
to
metaphysics
any
one
may
easily
observe
that
space
or
extension
consists
of
a
number
of
parts
disposed
in
a
certain
order
and
capable
of
being
at
once
present
to
the
sight
or
feeling
on
the
contrary
time
or
succession
though
it
consists
likewise
of
parts
never
presents
to
us
more
than
one
at
once
nor
is
it
possible
for
any
two
of
them
ever
to
be
these
qualities
of
the
objects
have
a
suitable
effect
on
the
imagination
the
parts
of
extension
being
susceptible
of
an
union
to
the
senses
acquire
an
union
in
the
fancy
and
as
the
appearance
of
one
part
excludes
not
another
the
transition
or
passage
of
the
thought
through
the
contiguous
parts
is
by
that
means
rendered
more
smooth
and
easy
on
the
other
hand
the
incompatibility
of
the
parts
of
time
in
their
real
existence
separates
them
in
the
imagination
and
makes
it
more
difficult
for
that
faculty
to
trace
any
long
succession
or
series
of
events
every
part
must
appear
single
and
alone
nor
can
regularly
have
entrance
into
the
fancy
without
banishing
what
is
supposed
to
have
been
immediately
precedent
by
this
means
any
distance
in
time
causes
a
greater
interruption
in
the
thought
than
an
equal
distance
in
space
and
consequently
weakens
more
considerably
the
idea
and
consequently
the
passions
which
depend
in
a
great
measure
on
the
imagination
according
to
my
system
there
is
another
phaenomenon
of
a
like
nature
with
the
foregoing
viz
the
superior
effects
of
the
same
distance
in
futurity
above
that
in
the
past
this
difference
with
respect
to
the
will
is
easily
accounted
for
as
none
of
our
actions
can
alter
the
past
it
is
not
strange
it
should
never
determine
the
will
but
with
respect
to
the
passions
the
question
is
yet
entire
and
well
worth
the
examining
besides
the
propensity
to
a
gradual
progression
through
the
points
of
space
and
time
we
have
another
peculiarity
in
our
method
of
thinking
which
concurs
in
producing
this
phaenomenon
we
always
follow
the
succession
of
time
in
placing
our
ideas
and
from
the
consideration
of
any
object
pass
more
easily
to
that
which
follows
immediately
after
it
than
to
that
which
went
before
it
we
may
learn
this
among
other
instances
from
the
order
which
is
always
observed
in
historical
narrations
nothing
but
an
absolute
necessity
can
oblige
an
historian
to
break
the
order
of
time
and
in
his
narration
give
the
precedence
to
an
event
which
was
in
reality
posterior
to
another
this
will
easily
be
applied
to
the
question
in
hand
if
we
reflect
on
what
i
have
before
observed
that
the
present
situation
of
the
person
is
always
that
of
the
imagination
and
that
it
is
from
thence
we
proceed
to
the
conception
of
any
distant
object
when
the
object
is
past
the
progression
of
the
thought
in
passing
to
it
from
the
present
is
contrary
to
nature
as
proceeding
from
one
point
of
time
to
that
which
is
preceding
and
from
that
to
another
preceding
in
opposition
to
the
natural
course
of
the
succession
on
the
other
hand
when
we
turn
our
thought
to
a
future
object
our
fancy
flows
along
the
stream
of
time
and
arrives
at
the
object
by
an
order
which
seems
most
natural
passing
always
from
one
point
of
time
to
that
which
is
immediately
posterior
to
it
this
easy
progression
of
ideas
favours
the
imagination
and
makes
it
conceive
its
object
in
a
stronger
and
fuller
light
than
when
we
are
continually
opposed
in
our
passage
and
are
obliged
to
overcome
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
natural
propensity
of
the
fancy
a
small
degree
of
distance
in
the
past
has
therefore
a
greater
effect
in
interupting
and
weakening
the
conception
than
a
much
greater
in
the
future
from
this
effect
of
it
on
the
imagination
is
derived
its
influence
on
the
will
and
passions
there
is
another
cause
which
both
contributes
to
the
same
effect
and
proceeds
from
the
same
quality
of
the
fancy
by
which
we
are
determined
to
trace
the
succession
of
time
by
a
similar
succession
of
ideas
when
from
the
present
instant
we
consider
two
points
of
time
equally
distant
in
the
future
and
in
the
past
it
is
evident
that
abstractedly
considered
their
relation
to
the
present
is
almost
equal
for
as
the
future
will
sometime
be
present
so
the
past
was
once
present
if
we
coued
therefore
remove
this
quality
of
the
imagination
an
equal
distance
in
the
past
and
in
the
future
would
have
a
similar
influence
nor
is
this
only
true
when
the
fancy
remains
fixed
and
from
the
present
instant
surveys
the
future
and
the
past
but
also
when
it
changes
its
situation
and
places
us
in
different
periods
of
time
for
as
on
the
one
hand
in
supposing
ourselves
existent
in
a
point
of
time
interposed
betwixt
the
present
instant
and
the
future
object
we
find
the
future
object
approach
to
us
and
the
past
retire
and
become
more
distant
so
on
the
other
hand
in
supposing
ourselves
existent
in
a
point
of
time
interposed
betwixt
the
present
and
the
past
the
past
approaches
to
us
and
the
future
becomes
more
distant
but
from
the
property
of
the
fancy
we
rather
chuse
to
fix
our
thought
on
the
point
of
time
interposed
betwixt
the
present
and
the
future
than
on
that
betwixt
the
present
and
the
past
we
advance
rather
than
retard
our
existence
and
following
what
seems
the
natural
succession
of
time
proceed
from
past
to
present
and
from
present
to
future
by
which
means
we
conceive
the
future
as
flowing
every
moment
nearer
us
and
the
past
as
retiring
an
equal
distance
therefore
in
the
past
and
in
the
future
has
not
the
same
effect
on
the
imagination
and
that
because
we
consider
the
one
as
continually
encreasing
and
the
other
as
continually
diminishing
the
fancy
anticipates
the
course
of
things
and
surveys
the
object
in
that
condition
to
which
it
tends
as
well
as
in
that
which
is
regarded
as
the
present
sect
viii
the
same
subject
continued
thus
we
have
accounted
for
three
phaenomena
which
seem
pretty
remarkable
why
distance
weakens
the
conception
and
passion
why
distance
in
time
has
a
greater
effect
than
that
in
space
and
why
distance
in
past
time
has
still
a
greater
effect
than
that
in
future
we
must
now
consider
three
phaenomena
which
seem
to
be
in
a
manner
the
reverse
of
these
why
a
very
great
distance
encreases
our
esteem
and
admiration
for
an
object
why
such
a
distance
in
time
encreases
it
more
than
that
in
space
and
a
distance
in
past
time
more
than
that
in
future
the
curiousness
of
the
subject
will
i
hope
excuse
my
dwelling
on
it
for
some
time
to
begin
with
the
first
phaenomenon
why
a
great
distance
encreases
our
esteem
and
admiration
for
an
object
it
is
evident
that
the
mere
view
and
contemplation
of
any
greatness
whether
successive
or
extended
enlarges
the
soul
and
give
it
a
sensible
delight
and
pleasure
a
wide
plain
the
ocean
eternity
a
succession
of
several
ages
all
these
are
entertaining
objects
and
excel
every
thing
however
beautiful
which
accompanies
not
its
beauty
with
a
suitable
greatness
now
when
any
very
distant
object
is
presented
to
the
imagination
we
naturally
reflect
on
the
interposed
distance
and
by
that
means
conceiving
something
great
and
magnificent
receive
the
usual
satisfaction
but
as
the
fancy
passes
easily
from
one
idea
to
another
related
to
it
and
transports
to
the
second
all
the
passions
excited
by
the
first
the
admiration
which
is
directed
to
the
distance
naturally
diffuses
itself
over
the
distant
object
accordingly
we
find
that
it
is
not
necessary
the
object
should
be
actually
distant
from
us
in
order
to
cause
our
admiration
but
that
it
is
sufficient
if
by
the
natural
association
of
ideas
it
conveys
our
view
to
any
considerable
distance
a
great
traveller
though
in
the
same
chamber
will
pass
for
a
very
extraordinary
person
as
a
greek
medal
even
in
our
cabinet
is
always
esteemed
a
valuable
curiosity
here
the
object
by
a
natural
transition
conveys
our
views
to
the
distance
and
the
admiration
which
arises
from
that
distance
by
another
natural
transition
returns
back
to
the
object
but
though
every
great
distance
produces
an
admiration
for
the
distant
object
a
distance
in
time
has
a
more
considerable
effect
than
that
in
space
antient
busts
and
inscriptions
are
more
valued
than
japan
tables
and
not
to
mention
the
greeks
and
romans
it
is
certain
we
regard
with
more
veneration
the
old
chaldeans
and
egyptians
than
the
modern
chinese
and
persians
and
bestow
more
fruitless
pains
to
dear
up
the
history
and
chronology
of
the
former
than
it
would
cost
us
to
make
a
voyage
and
be
certainly
informed
of
the
character
learning
and
government
of
the
latter
i
shall
be
obliged
to
make
a
digression
in
order
to
explain
this
phaenomenon
it
is
a
quality
very
observable
in
human
nature
that
any
opposition
which
does
not
entirely
discourage
and
intimidate
us
has
rather
a
contrary
effect
and
inspires
us
with
a
more
than
ordinary
grandeur
and
magnanimity
in
collecting
our
force
to
overcome
the
opposition
we
invigorate
the
soul
and
give
it
an
elevation
with
which
otherwise
it
would
never
have
been
acquainted
compliance
by
rendering
our
strength
useless
makes
us
insensible
of
it
but
opposition
awakens
and
employs
it
this
is
also
true
in
the
universe
opposition
not
only
enlarges
the
soul
but
the
soul
when
full
of
courage
and
magnanimity
in
a
manner
seeks
opposition

and
among

in
answer
to
his
prayers
a
slavering
boar
or
to
have
a
tawny
lion
come
down
from
the
mountain
whatever
supports
and
fills
the
passions
is
agreeable
to
us
as
on
the
contrary
what
weakens
and
infeebles
them
is
uneasy
as
opposition
has
the
first
effect
and
facility
the
second
no
wonder
the
mind
in
certain
dispositions
desires
the
former
and
is
averse
to
the
latter
these
principles
have
an
effect
on
the
imagination
as
well
as
on
the
passions
to
be
convinced
of
this
we
need
only
consider
the
influence
of
heights
and
depths
on
that
faculty
any
great
elevation
of
place
communicates
a
kind
of
pride
or
sublimity
of
imagination
and
gives
a
fancyed
superiority
over
those
that
lie
below
and
vice
versa
a
sublime
and
strong
imagination
conveys
the
idea
of
ascent
and
elevation
hence
it
proceeds
that
we
associate
in
a
manner
the
idea
of
whatever
is
good
with
that
of
height
and
evil
with
lowness
heaven
is
supposed
to
be
above
and
hell
below
a
noble
genius
is
called
an
elevate
and
sublime
one

the

on
the
contrary
a
vulgar
and
trivial
conception

stiled
indifferently
low
or
mean
prosperity
is
denominated
ascent
and
adversity
descent
kings
and
princes
are
supposed
to
be
placed
at
the
top
of
human
affairs
as
peasants
and
are
said
to
be
in
the
lowest
stations
these
methods
of
thinking
and
of
expressing
ourselves
are
not
of
so
little
consequence
as
they
may
appear
at
first
sight
it
is
evident
to
common
sense
as
well
as
philosophy
that
there
is
no
natural
nor
essential
difference
betwixt
high
and
low
and
that
this
distinction
arises
only
from
the
gravitation
of
matter
which
produces
a
motion
from
the
one
to
the
other
the
very
same
direction
which
in
this
part
of
the
globe
is
called
ascent
is
denominated
descent
in
our
antipodes
which
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
the
contrary
tendency
of
bodies
now
it
is
certain
that
the
tendency
of
bodies
continually
operating
upon
our
senses
must
produce
from
custom
a
like
tendency
in
the
fancy
and
that
when
we
consider
any
object
situated
in
an
ascent
the
idea
of
its
weight
gives
us
a
propensity
to
transport
it
from
the
place
in
which
it
is
situated
to
the
place
immediately
below
it
and
so
on
until
we
come
to
the
ground
which
equally
stops
the
body
and
our
imagination
for
a
like
reason
we
feel
a
difficulty
in
mounting
and
pass
not
without
a
kind
of
reluctance
from
the
inferior
to
that
which
is
situated
above
it
as
if
our
ideas
acquired
a
kind
of
gravity
from
their
objects
as
a
proof
of
this
do
we
not
find
that
the
facility
which
is
so
much
studyed
in
music
and
poetry
is
called
the
fail
or
cadency
of
the
harmony
or
period
the
idea
of
facility
communicating
to
us
that
of
descent
in
the
same
manner
as
descent
produces
a
facility
since
the
imagination
therefore
in
running
from
low
to
high
finds
an
opposition
in
its
internal
qualities
and
principles
and
since
the
soul
when
elevated
with
joy
and
courage
in
a
manner
seeks
opposition
and
throws
itself
with
alacrity
into
any
scene
of
thought
or
action
where
its
courage
meets
with
matter
to
nourish
and
employ
it
it
follows
that
everything
which
invigorates
and
inlivens
the
soul
whether
by
touching
the
passions
or
imagination
naturally
conveys
to
the
fancy
this
inclination
for
ascent
and
determines
it
to
run
against
the
natural
stream
of
its
thoughts
and
conceptions
this
aspiring
progress
of
the
imagination
suits
the
present
disposition
of
the
mind
and
the
difficulty
instead
of
extinguishing
its
vigour
and
alacrity
has
the
contrary
affect
of
sustaining
and
encreasing
it
virtue
genius
power
and
riches
are
for
this
reason
associated
with
height
and
sublimity
as
poverty
slavery
and
folly
are
conjoined
with
descent
and
lowness
were
the
case
the
same
with
us
as
milton
represents
it
to
be
with
the
angels
to
whom
descent
is
adverse
and
who
can
not
sink
without
labour
and
compulsion
this
order
of
things
would
be
entirely
inverted
as
appears
hence
that
the
very
nature
of
ascent
and
descent
is
derived
from
the
difficulty
and
propensity
and
consequently
every
one
of
their
effects
proceeds
from
that
origin
all
this
is
easily
applied
to
the
present
question
why
a
considerable
distance
in
time
produces
a
greater
veneration
for
the
distant
objects
than
a
like
removal
in
space
the
imagination
moves
with
more
difficulty
in
passing
from
one
portion
of
time
to
another
than
in
a
transition
through
the
parts
of
space
and
that
because
space
or
extension
appears
united
to
our
senses
while
time
or
succession
is
always
broken
and
divided
this
difficulty
when
joined
with
a
small
distance
interrupts
and
weakens
the
fancy
but
has
a
contrary
effect
in
a
great
removal
the
mind
elevated
by
the
vastness
of
its
object
is
still
farther
elevated
by
the
difficulty
of
the
conception
and
being
obliged
every
moment
to
renew
its
efforts
in
the
transition
from
one
part
of
time
to
another
feels
a
more
vigorous
and
sublime
disposition
than
in
a
transition
through
the
parts
of
space
where
the
ideas
flow
along
with
easiness
and
facility
in
this
disposition
the
imagination
passing
as
is
usual
from
the
consideration
of
the
distance
to
the
view
of
the
distant
objects
gives
us
a
proportionable
veneration
for
it
and
this
is
the
reason
why
all
the
relicts
of
antiquity
are
so
precious
in
our
eyes
and
appear
more
valuable
than
what
is
brought
even
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
world
the
third
phaenomenon
i
have
remarked
will
be
a
full
confirmation
of
this
it
is
not
every
removal
in
time
which
has
the
effect
of
producing
veneration
and
esteem
we
are
not
apt
to
imagine
our
posterity
will
excel
us
or
equal
our
ancestors
this
phaenomenon
is
the
more
remarkable
because
any
distance
in
futurity
weakens
not
our
ideas
so
much
as
an
equal
removal
in
the
past
though
a
removal
in
the
past
when
very
great
encreases
our
passions
beyond
a
like
removal
in
the
future
yet
a
small
removal
has
a
greater
influence
in
diminishing
them
in
our
common
way
of
thinking
we
are
placed
in
a
kind
of
middle
station
betwixt
the
past
and
future
and
as
our
imagination
finds
a
kind
of
difficulty
in
running
along
the
former
and
a
facility
in
following
the
course
of
the
latter
the
difficulty
conveys
the
notion
of
ascent
and
the
facility
of
the
contrary
hence
we
imagine
our
ancestors
to
be
in
a
manner
mounted
above
us
and
our
posterity
to
lie
below
us
our
fancy
arrives
not
at
the
one
without
effort
but
easily
reaches
the
other
which
effort
weakens
the
conception
where
the
distance
is
small
but
enlarges
and
elevates
the
imagination
when
attended
with
a
suitable
object
as
on
the
other
hand
the
facility
assists
the
fancy
in
a
small
removal
but
takes
off
from
its
force
when
it
contemplates
any
considerable
distance
it
may
not
be
improper
before
we
leave
this
subject
of
the
will
to
resume
in
a
few
words
all
that
has
been
said
concerning
it
in
order
to
set
the
whole
more
distinctly
before
the
eyes
of
the
reader
what
we
commonly
understand
by
passion
is
a
violent
and
sensible
emotion
of
mind
when
any
good
or
evil
is
presented
or
any
object
which
by
the
original
formation
of
our
faculties
is
fitted
to
excite
an
appetite
by
reason
we
mean
affections
of
the
very
same
kind
with
the
former
but
such
as
operate
more
calmly
and
cause
no
disorder
in
the
temper
which
tranquillity
leads
us
into
a
mistake
concerning
them
and
causes
us
to
regard
them
as
conclusions
only
of
our
intellectual
faculties
both
the
causes
and
effects
of
these
violent
and
calm
passions
are
pretty
variable
and
depend
in
a
great
measure
on
the
peculiar
temper
and
disposition
of
every
individual
generally
speaking
the
violent
passions
have
a
more
powerful
influence
on
the
will
though
it
is
often
found
that
the
calm
ones
when
corroborated
by
reflection
and
seconded
by
resolution
are
able
to
controul
them
in
their
most
furious
movements
what
makes
this
whole
affair
more
uncertain
is
that
a
calm
passion
may
easily
be
changed
into
a
violent
one
either
by
a
change
of
temper
or
of
the
circumstances
and
situation
of
the
object
as
by
the
borrowing
of
force
from
any
attendant
passion
by
custom
or
by
exciting
the
imagination
upon
the
whole
this
struggle
of
passion
and
of
reason
as
it
is
called
diversifies
human
life
and
makes
men
so
different
not
only
from
each
other
but
also
from
themselves
in
different
times
philosophy
can
only
account
for
a
few
of
the
greater
and
more
sensible
events
of
this
war
but
must
leave
all
the
smaller
and
more
delicate
revolutions
as
dependent
on
principles
too
fine
and
minute
for
her
comprehension
sect
ix
of
the
direct
passions
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
the
passions
both
direct
and
indirect
are
founded
on
pain
and
pleasure
and
that
in
order
to
produce
an
affection
of
any
kind
it
is
only
requisite
to
present
some
good
or
evil
upon
the
removal
of
pain
and
pleasure
there
immediately
follows
a
removal
of
love
and
hatred
pride
and
humility
desire
and
aversion
and
of
most
of
our
reflective
or
secondary
impressions
the
impressions
which
arise
from
good
and
evil
most
naturally
and
with
the
least
preparation
are
the
direct
passions
of
desire
and
aversion
grief
and
joy
hope
and
fear
along
with
volition
the
mind
by
an
original
instinct
tends
to
unite
itself
with
the
good
and
to
avoid
the
evil
though
they
be
conceived
merely
in
idea
and
be
considered
as
to
exist
in
any
future
period
of
time
but
supposing
that
there
is
an
immediate
impression
of
pain
or
pleasure
and
that
arising
from
an
object
related
to
ourselves
or
others
this
does
not
prevent
the
propensity
or
aversion
with
the
consequent
emotions
but
by
concurring
with
certain
dormant
principles
of
the
human
mind
excites
the
new
impressions
of
pride
or
humility
love
or
hatred
that
propensity
which
unites
us
to
the
object
or
separates
us
from
it
still
continues
to
operate
but
in
conjunction
with
the
indirect
passions
which
arise
from
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
these
indirect
passions
being
always
agreeable
or
uneasy
give
in
their
turn
additional
force
to
the
direct
passions
and
encrease
our
desire
and
aversion
to
the
object
thus
a
suit
of
fine
cloaths
produces
pleasure
from
their
beauty
and
this
pleasure
produces
the
direct
passions
or
the
impressions
of
volition
and
desire
again
when
these
cloaths
are
considered
as
belonging
to
ourself
the
double
relation
conveys
to
us
the
sentiment
of
pride
which
is
an
indirect
passion
and
the
pleasure
which
attends
that
passion
returns
back
to
the
direct
affections
and
gives
new
force
to
our
desire
or
volition
joy
or
hope
when
good
is
certain
or
probable
it
produces
joy
when
evil
is
in
the
same
situation
there
arises
grief
or
sorrow
when
either
good
or
evil
is
uncertain
it
gives
rise
to
fear
or
hope
according
to
the
degrees
of
uncertainty
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
desire
arises
from
good
considered
simply
and
aversion
is
derived
from
evil
the
will
exerts
itself
when
either
the
good
or
the
absence
of
the
evil
may
be
attained
by
any
action
of
the
mind
or
body
beside
good
and
evil
or
in
other
words
pain
and
pleasure
the
direct
passions
frequently
arise
from
a
natural
impulse
or
instinct
which
is
perfectly
unaccountable
of
this
kind
is
the
desire
of
punishment
to
our
enemies
and
of
happiness
to
our
friends
hunger
lust
and
a
few
other
bodily
appetites
these
passions
properly
speaking
produce
good
and
evil
and
proceed
not
from
them
like
the
other
affections
none
of
the
direct
affections
seem
to
merit
our
particular
attention
except
hope
and
fear
which
we
shall
here
endeavour
to
account
for
it
is
evident
that
the
very
same
event
which
by
its
certainty
would
produce
grief
or
joy
gives
always
rise
to
fear
or
hope
when
only
probable
and
uncertain
in
order
therefore
to
understand
the
reason
why
this
circumstance
makes
such
a
considerable
difference
we
must
reflect
on
what
i
have
already
advanced
in
the
preceding
book
concerning
the
nature
of
probability
probability
arises
from
an
opposition
of
contrary
chances
or
causes
by
which
the
mind
is
not
allowed
to
fix
on
either
side
but
is
incessantly
tost
from
one
to
another
and
at
one
moment
is
determined
to
consider
an
object
as
existent
and
at
another
moment
as
the
contrary
the
imagination
or
understanding
call
it
which
you
please
fluctuates
betwixt
the
opposite
views
and
though
perhaps
it
may
be
oftener
turned
to
the
one
side
than
the
other
it
is
impossible
for
it
by
reason
of
the
opposition
of
causes
or
chances
to
rest
on
either
the
pro
and
con
of
the
question
alternately
prevail
and
the
mind
surveying
the
object
in
its
opposite
principles
finds
such
a
contrariety
as
utterly
destroys
all
certainty
and
established
opinion
suppose
then
that
the
object
concerning
whose
reality
we
are
doubtful
is
an
object
either
of
desire
or
aversion
it
is
evident
that
according
as
the
mind
turns
itself
either
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
it
must
feel
a
momentary
impression
of
joy
or
sorrow
an
object
whose
existence
we
desire
gives
satisfaction
when
we
reflect
on
those
causes
which
produce
it
and
for
the
same
reason
excites
grief
or
uneasiness
from
the
opposite
consideration
so
that
as
the
understanding
in
all
probable
questions
is
divided
betwixt
the
contrary
points
of
view
the
affections
must
in
the
same
manner
be
divided
betwixt
opposite
emotions
now
if
we
consider
the
human
mind
we
shall
find
that
with
regard
to
the
passions
it
is
not
the
nature
of
a
of
music
which
in
running
over
all
the
notes
immediately
loses
the
sound
after
the
breath
ceases
but
rather
resembles
a
where
after
each
stroke
the
vibrations
still
retain
some
sound
which
gradually
and
insensibly
decays
the
imagination
is
extreme
quick
and
agile
but
the
passions
are
slow
and
restive
for
which
reason
when
any
object
is
presented
that
affords
a
variety
of
views
to
the
one
and
emotions
to
the
other
though
the
fancy
may
change
its
views
with
great
celerity
each
stroke
will
not
produce
a
clear
and
distinct
note
of
passion
but
the
one
passion
will
always
be
mixt
and
confounded
with
the
other
according
as
the
probability
inclines
to
good
or
evil
the
passion
of
joy
or
sorrow
predominates
in
the
composition
because
the
nature
of
probability
is
to
cast
a
superior
number
of
views
or
chances
on
one
side
or
which
is
the
same
thing
a
superior
number
of
returns
of
one
passion
or
since
the
dispersed
passions
are
collected
into
one
a
superior
degree
of
that
passion
that
is
in
other
words
the
grief
and
joy
being
intermingled
with
each
other
by
means
of
the
contrary
views
of
the
imagination
produce
by
their
union
the
passions
of
hope
and
fear
upon
this
head
there
may
be
started
a
very
curious
question
concerning
that
contrariety
of
passions
which
is
our
present
subject
it
is
observable
that
where
the
objects
of
contrary
passions
are
presented
at
once
beside
the
encrease
of
the
predominant
passion
which
has
been
already
explained
and
commonly
arises
at
their
first
shock
or
rencounter
it
sometimes
happens
that
both
the
passions
exist
successively
and
by
short
intervals
sometimes
that
they
destroy
each
other
and
neither
of
them
takes
place
and
sometimes
that
both
of
them
remain
united
in
the
mind
it
may
therefore
be
asked
by
what
theory
we
can
explain
these
variations
and
to
what
general
principle
we
can
reduce
them
when
the
contrary
passions
arise
from
objects
entirely
different
they
take
place
alternately
the
want
of
relation
in
the
ideas
separating
the
impressions
from
each
other
and
preventing
their
opposition
thus
when
a
man
is
afflicted
for
the
loss
of
a
and
joyful
for
the
birth
of
a
son
the
mind
running
from
the
agreeable
to
the
calamitous
object
with
whatever
celerity
it
may
perform
this
motion
can
scarcely
temper
the
one
affection
with
the
other
and
remain
betwixt
them
in
a
state
of
indifference
it
more
easily
attains
that
calm
situation
when
the
same
event
is
of
a
mixt
nature
and
contains
something
adverse
and
something
prosperous
in
its
different
circumstances
for
in
that
case
both
the
passions
mingling
with
each
other
by
means
of
the
relation
become
mutually
destructive
and
leave
the
mind
in
perfect
tranquility
but
suppose
in
the
third
place
that
the
object
is
not
a
compound
of
good
or
evil
but
is
considered
as
probable
or
improbable
in
any
degree
in
that
case
i
assert
that
the
contrary
passions
will
both
of
them
be
present
at
once
in
the
soul
and
instead
of
destroying
and
tempering
each
other
will
subsist
together
and
produce
a
third
impression
or
affection
by
their
union
contrary
passions
are
not
capable
of
destroying
each
other
except
when
their
contrary
movements
exactly
rencounter
and
are
opposite
in
their
direction
as
well
as
in
the
sensation
they
produce
this
exact
rencounter
depends
upon
the
relations
of
those
ideas
from
which
they
are
derived
and
is
more
or
less
perfect
according
to
the
degrees
of
the
relation
in
the
case
of
probability
the
contrary
chances
are
so
far
related
that
they
determine
concerning
the
existence
or
of
the
same
object
but
this
relation
is
far
from
being
perfect
since
some
of
the
chances
lie
on
the
side
of
existence
and
others
on
that
of
which
are
objects
altogether
incompatible
it
is
impossible
by
one
steady
view
to
survey
the
opposite
chances
and
the
events
dependent
on
them
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
imagination
should
run
alternately
from
the
one
to
the
other
each
view
of
the
imagination
produces
its
peculiar
passion
which
decays
away
by
degrees
and
is
followed
by
a
sensible
vibration
after
the
stroke
the
incompatibility
of
the
views
keeps
the
passions
from
shocking
in
a
direct
line
if
that
expression
may
be
allowed
and
yet
their
relation
is
sufficient
to
mingle
their
fainter
emotions
it
is
after
this
manner
that
hope
and
fear
arise
from
the
different
mixture
of
these
opposite
passions
of
grief
and
joy
and
from
their
imperfect
union
and
conjunction
upon
the
whole
contrary
passions
succeed
each
other
alternately
when
they
arise
from
different
objects
they
mutually
destroy
each
other
when
they
proceed
from
different
parts
of
the
same
and
they
subsist
both
of
them
and
mingle
together
when
they
are
derived
from
the
contrary
and
incompatible
chances
or
possibilities
on
which
any
one
object
depends
the
influence
of
the
relations
of
ideas
is
plainly
seen
in
this
whole
affair
if
the
objects
of
the
contrary
passions
be
totally
different
the
passions
are
like
two
opposite
liquors
in
different
bottles
which
have
no
influence
on
each
other
if
the
objects
be
intimately
connected
the
passions
are
like
an
alcali
and
an
acid
which
being
mingled
destroy
each
other
if
the
relation
be
more
imperfect
and
consists
in
the
contradictory
views
of
the
same
object
the
passions
are
like
oil
and
vinegar
which
however
mingled
never
perfectly
unite
and
incorporate
as
the
hypothesis
concerning
hope
and
fear
carries
its
own
evidence
along
with
it
we
shall
be
the
more
concise
in
our
proofs
a
few
strong
arguments
are
better
than
many
weak
ones
the
passions
of
fear
and
hope
may
arise
when
the
chances
are
equal
on
both
sides
and
no
superiority
can
be
discovered
in
the
one
above
the
other
nay
in
this
situation
the
passions
are
rather
the
strongest
as
the
mind
has
then
the
least
foundation
to
rest
upon
and
is
tossed
with
the
greatest
uncertainty
throw
in
a
superior
degree
of
probability
to
the
side
of
grief
you
immediately
see
that
passion
diffuse
itself
over
the
composition
and
tincture
it
into
fear
encrease
the
probability
and
by
that
means
the
grief
the
fear
prevails
still
more
and
more
till
at
last
it
runs
insensibly
as
the
joy
continually
diminishes
into
pure
grief
after
you
have
brought
it
to
this
situation
diminish
the
grief
after
the
same
manner
that
you
encreased
it
by
diminishing
the
probability
on
that
side
and
you
see
the
passion
clear
every
moment
until
it
changes
insensibly
into
hope
which
again
runs
after
the
same
manner
by
slow
degrees
into
joy
as
you
encrease
that
part
of
the
composition
by
the
encrease
of
the
probability
are
not
these
as
plain
proofs
that
the
passions
of
fear
and
hope
are
mixtures
of
grief
and
joy
as
in
optics
it
is
a
proof
that
a
coloured
ray
of
the
sun
passing
through
a
prism
is
a
composition
of
two
others
when
as
you
diminish
or
encrease
the
quantity
of
either
you
find
it
prevail
proportionably
more
or
less
in
the
composition
i
am
sure
neither
natural
nor
moral
philosophy
admits
of
stronger
proofs
probability
is
of
two
kinds
either
when
the
object
is
really
in
itself
uncertain
and
to
be
determined
by
chance
or
when
though
the
object
be
already
certain
yet
it
is
uncertain
to
our
judgment
which
finds
a
number
of
proofs
on
each
side
of
the
question
both
these
kinds
of
probabilities
cause
fear
and
hope
which
can
only
proceed
from
that
property
in
which
they
agree
viz
the
uncertainty
and
fluctuation
they
bestow
on
the
imagination
by
that
contrariety
of
views
which
is
common
to
both
it
is
a
probable
good
or
evil
that
commonly
produces
hope
or
fear
because
probability
being
a
wavering
and
unconstant
method
of
surveying
an
object
causes
naturally
a
like
mixture
and
uncertainty
of
passion
but
we
may
observe
that
wherever
from
other
causes
this
mixture
can
be
produced
the
passions
of
fear
and
hope
will
arise
even
though
there
be
no
probability
which
must
be
allowed
to
be
a
convincing
proof
of
the
present
hypothesis
we
find
that
an
evil
barely
conceived
as
possible
does
sometimes
produce
fear
especially
if
the
evil
be
very
great
a
man
can
not
think
of
excessive
pains
and
tortures
without
trembling
if
he
be
in
the
least
danger
of
suffering
them
the
smallness
of
the
probability
is
compensated
by
the
greatness
of
the
evil
and
the
sensation
is
equally
lively
as
if
the
evil
were
more
probable
one
view
or
glimpse
of
the
former
has
the
same
effect
as
several
of
the
latter
but
they
are
not
only
possible
evils
that
cause
fear
but
even
some
allowed
to
be
impossible
as
when
we
tremble
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
though
we
know
ourselves
to
be
in
perfect
security
and
have
it
in
our
choice
whether
we
wili
advance
a
step
farther
this
proceeds
from
the
immediate
presence
of
the
evil
which
influences
the
imagination
in
the
same
manner
as
the
certainty
of
it
would
do
but
being
encountered
by
the
reflection
on
our
security
is
immediately
retracted
and
causes
the
same
kind
of
passion
as
when
from
a
contrariety
of
chances
contrary
passions
are
produced
evils
that
are
certain
have
sometimes
the
same
effect
in
producing
fear
as
the
possible
or
impossible
thus
a
man
in
a
strong
prison
without
the
least
means
of
escape
trembles
at
the
thought
of
the
rack
to
which
he
is
sentenced
this
happens
only
when
the
certain
evil
is
terrible
and
confounding
in
which
case
the
mind
continually
rejects
it
with
horror
while
it
continually
presses
in
upon
the
thought
the
evil
is
there
flxed
and
established
but
the
mind
can
not
endure
to
fix
upon
it
from
which
fluctuation
and
uncertainty
there
arises
a
passion
of
much
the
same
appearance
with
fear
but
it
is
not
only
where
good
or
evil
is
uncertain
as
to
its
existence
but
also
as
to
its
kind
that
fear
or
hope
arises
let
one
be
told
by
a
person
whose
veracity
he
can
not
doubt
of
that
one
of
his
sons
is
suddenly
killed
it
is
evident
the
passion
this
event
would
occasion
would
not
settle
into
pure
grief
till
he
got
certain
information
which
of
his
sons
he
had
lost
here
there
is
an
evil
certain
but
the
kind
of
it
uncertain
consequently
the
fear
we
feel
on
this
occasion
is
without
the
least
mixture
of
joy
and
arises
merely
from
the
fluctuation
of
the
fancy
betwixt
its
objects
and
though
each
side
of
the
question
produces
here
the
same
passion
yet
that
passion
can
not
settle
but
receives
from
the
imagination
a
tremulous
and
unsteady
motion
resembling
in
its
cause
as
well
as
in
its
sensation
the
mixture
and
contention
of
grief
and
joy
from
these
principles
we
may
account
for
a
phaenomenon
in
the
passions
which
at
first
sight
seems
very
extraordinary
viz
that
surprize
is
apt
to
change
into
fear
and
every
thing
that
is
unexpected
affrights
us
the
most
obvious
conclusion
from
this
is
that
human
nature
is
in
general
pusillanimous
since
upon
the
sudden
appearance
of
any
object
we
immediately
conclude
it
to
be
an
evil
and
without
waiting
till
we
can
examine
its
nature
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
are
at
first
affected
with
fear
this
i
say
is
the
most
obvious
conclusion
but
upon
farther
examination
we
shall
find
that
the
phaenomenon
is
otherwise
to
be
accounted
for
the
suddenness
and
strangeness
of
an
appearance
naturally
excite
a
commotion
in
the
mind
like
every
thing
for
which
we
are
not
prepared
and
to
which
we
are
not
accustomed
this
commotion
again
naturally
produces
a
curiosity
or
inquisitiveness
which
being
very
violent
from
the
strong
and
sudden
impulse
of
the
object
becomes
uneasy
and
resembles
in
its
fluctuation
and
uncertainty
the
sensation
of
fear
or
the
mixed
passions
of
grief
and
joy
this
image
of
fear
naturally
converts
into
the
thing
itself
and
gives
us
a
real
apprehension
of
evil
as
the
mind
always
forms
its
judgments
more
from
its
present
disposition
than
from
the
nature
of
its
objects
thus
all
kinds
of
uncertainty
have
a
strong
connexion
with
fear
even
though
they
do
not
cause
any
opposition
of
passions
by
the
opposite
views
and
considerations
they
present
to
us
a
person
who
has
left
his
friend
in
any
malady
will
feel
more
anxiety
upon
his
account
than
if
he
were
present
though
perhaps
he
is
not
only
incapable
of
giving
him
assistance
but
likewise
of
judging
of
the
event
of
his
sickness
in
this
case
though
the
principal
object
of
the
passion
viz
the
life
or
death
of
his
friend
be
to
him
equally
uncertain
when
present
as
when
absent
yet
there
are
a
thousand
little
circumstances
of
his
situation
and
condition
the
knowledge
of
which
fixes
the
idea
and
prevents
that
fluctuation
and
uncertainty
so
near
allyed
to
fear
uncertainty
is
indeed
in
one
respect
as
near
allyed
to
hope
as
to
fear
since
it
makes
an
essential
part
in
the
composition
of
the
former
passion
but
the
reason
why
it
inclines
not
to
that
side
is
that
uncertainty
alone
is
uneasy
and
has
a
reladon
of
impressions
to
the
uneasy
passions
it
is
thus
our
uncertainty
concerning
any
minute
circumstance
relating
to
a
person
encreases
our
apprehensions
of
his
death
or
misfortune
horace
has
remarked
this
phaenomenon
ut
assidens
implumi
bus
pullus
avis
serpentium
allapsus
tirnet
magis
relictis
non
ut
adsit
auxili
latura
plus
presentibus
as
a
bird
watching
over
her
fledgelings
is
more
afraid
of
their
being
attacked
by
snakes
if
she
were
to
leave
them
even
though
were
she
to
stay
she
would
not
be
any
more
capable
of
helping
them
when
they
were
with
her
but
this
principle
of
the
connexion
of
fear
with
uncertainty
i
carry
farther
and
observe
that
any
doubt
produces
that
passion
even
though
it
presents
nothing
to
us
on
any
side
but
what
is
good
and
desireable
a
virgin
on
her
bridalnight
goes
to

full
of
fears
and
apprehensions
though
she
expects
nothing
but
pleasure

the

kind
and
what
she
has
long
wished
for
the

and

of

the

wishes
and
joys
so
embarrass
the
mind
that
it
knows
not
on
what
passion
to
fix
itself
from
whence
arises
a
fluttering
or
unsettledness
of
the
spirits
which
being
in
some
degree
uneasy
very
naturally
degenerates
into
fear
thus
we
still
find
that
whatever
causes
any
fluctuation
or
mixture
of
passions
with
any
degree
of
uneasiness
always
produces
fear
or
at
least
a
passion
so
like
it
that
they
are
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
i
have
here
confined
myself
to
the
examination
of
hope
and
fear
in
their
most
simple
and
natural
situation
without
considering
all
the
variations
they
may
receive
from
the
mixture
of
different
views
and
reflections
terror
consternation
astonishment
anxiety
and
other
passions
of
that
kind
are
nothing
but
different
species
and
degrees
of
fear
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
a
different
situation
of
the
object
or
a
different
turn
of
thought
may
change
even
the
sensation
of
a
passion
and
this
may
in
general
account
for
all
the
particular
of
the
other
affections
as
well
as
of
fear
love
may
shew
itself
in
the
shape
of
tenderness
friendship
intimacy
esteem
and
in
many
other
appearances
which
at
the
bottom
are
the
same
affections
and
arise
from
the
same
causes
though
with
a
small
variation
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
any
particular
account
of
it
is
for
this
reason
i
have
all
along
confined
myself
to
the
principal
passion
the
same
care
of
avoiding
prolixity
is
the
reason
why
i
wave
the
examination
of
the
will
and
direct
passions
as
they
appear
in
animals
since
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
they
are
of
the
same
nature
and
excited
by
the
same
causes
as
in
human
creatures
i
leave
this
to
the
reader
own
observation
desiring
him
at
the
same
time
to
consider
the
additional
force
this
bestows
on
the
present
system
sect
x
of
curiosity
or
the
love
of
truth
but
methinks
we
have
been
not
a
little
inattentive
to
run
over
so
many
different
parts
of
the
human
mind
and
examine
so
many
passions
without
taking
once
into
the
consideration
that
love
of
truth
which
was
the
first
source
of
all
our
enquiries
twill
therefore
be
proper
before
we
leave
this
subject
to
bestow
a
few
reflections
on
that
passion
and
shew
its
origin
in
human
nature
it
is
an
affection
of
so
peculiar
a
kind
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
treated
of
it
under
any
of
those
heads
which
we
have
examined
without
danger
of
obscurity
and
confusion
truth
is
of
two
kinds
consisting
either
in
the
discovery
of
the
proportions
of
ideas
considered
as
such
or
in
the
conformity
of
our
ideas
of
objects
to
their
real
existence
it
is
certain
that
the
former
species
of
truth
is
not
desired
merely
as
truth
and
that
it
is
not
the
justness
of
our
conclusions
which
alone
gives
the
pleasure
for
these
conclusions
are
equally
just
when
we
discover
the
equality
of
two
bodies
by
a
pair
of
compasses
as
when
we
learn
it
by
a
mathematical
demonstration
and
though
in
the
one
case
the
proofs
be
demonstrative
and
in
the
other
only
sensible
yet
generally
speaking
the
mind
acquiesces
with
equal
assurance
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
and
in
an
arithmetical
operation
where
both
the
truth
and
the
assurance
are
of
the
same
nature
as
in
the
most
profound
algebraical
problem
the
pleasure
is
very
inconsiderable
if
rather
it
does
not
degenerate
into
pain
which
is
an
evident
proof
that
the
satisfaction
which
we
sometimes
receive
from
the
discovery
of
truth
proceeds
not
from
it
merely
as
such
but
only
as
endowed
with
certain
qualities
the
first
and
most
considerable
circumstance
requisite
to
render
truth
agreeable
is
the
genius
and
capacity
which
is
employed
in
its
invention
and
discovery
what
is
easy
and
obvious
is
never
valued
and
even
what
is
in
itself
difficult
if
we
come
to
the
knowledge
of
it
without
difficulty
and
without
any
stretch
of
thought
or
judgment
is
but
little
regarded
we
love
to
trace
the
demonstrations
of
mathematicians
but
should
receive
small
entertainment
from
a
person
who
should
barely
inform
us
of
the
proportions
of
lines
and
angles
though
we
reposed
the
utmost
confidence
both
in
his
judgment
and
veracity
in
this
case
it
is
sufficient
to
have
ears
to
learn
the
truth
we
never
are
obliged
to
fix
our
attention
or
exert
our
genius
which
of
all
other
exercises
of
the
mind
is
the
most
pleasant
and
agreeable
but
though
the
exercise
of
genius
be
the
principal
source
of
that
satisfaction
we
receive
from
the
sciences
yet
i
doubt
if
it
be
alone
sufficient
to
give
us
any
considerable
enjoyment
the
truth
we
discover
must
also
be
of
some
importance
it
is
easy
to
multiply
algebraical
problems
to
infinity
nor
is
there
any
end
in
the
discovery
of
the
proportions
of
conic
sections
though
few
mathematicians
take
any
pleasure
in
these
researches
but
turn
their
thoughts
to
what
is
more
useful
and
important
now
the
question
is
after
what
manner
this
utility
and
importance
operate
upon
us
the
difficulty
on
this
head
arises
from
hence
that
many
philosophers
have
consumed
their
time
have
destroyed
their
health
and
neglected
their
fortune
in
the
search
of
such
truths
as
they
esteemed
important
and
useful
to
the
world
though
it
appeared
from
their
whole
conduct
and
behaviour
that
they
were
not
endowed
with
any
share
of
public
spirit
nor
had
any
concern
for
the
interests
of
mankind
were
they
convinced
that
their
discoveries
were
of
no
consequence
they
would
entirely
lose
all
relish
for
their
studies
and
that
though
the
consequences
be
entirely
indifferent
to
them
which
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
to
remove
this
contradiction
we
must
consider
that
there
are
certain
desires
and
inclinations
which
go
no
farther
than
the
imagination
and
are
rather
the
faint
shadows
and
images
of
passions
than
any
real
affections
thus
suppose
a
man
who
takes
a
survey
of
the
fortifications
of
any
city
considers
their
strength
and
advantages
natural
or
acquired
observes
the
disposition
and
contrivance
of
the
bastions
ramparts
mines
and
other
military
works
it
is
plain
that
in
proportion
as
all
these
are
fitted
to
attain
their
ends
he
will
receive
a
suitable
pleasure
and
satisfaction
this
pleasure
as
it
arises
from
the
utility
not
the
form
of
the
objects
can
be
no
other
than
a
sympathy
with
the
inhabitants
for
whose
security
all
this
art
is
employed
though
it
is
possible
that
this
person
as
a
stranger
or
an
enemy
may
in
his
heart
have
no
kindness
for
them
or
may
even
entertain
a
hatred
against
them
it
may
indeed
be
objected
that
such
a
remote
sympathy
is
a
very
slight
foundation
for
a
passion
and
that
so
much
industry
and
application
as
we
frequently
observe
in
philosophers
can
never
be
derived
from
so
inconsiderable
an
original
but
here
i
return
to
what
i
have
already
remarked
that
the
pleasure
of
study
conflicts
chiefly
in
the
action
of
the
mind
and
the
exercise
of
the
genius
and
understanding
in
the
discovery
or
comprehension
of
any
truth
if
the
importance
of
the
truth
be
requisite
to
compleat
the
pleasure
it
is
not
on
account
of
any
considerable
addition
which
of
itself
it
brings
to
our
enjoyment
but
only
because
it
is
in
some
measure
requisite
to
fix
our
attention
when
we
are
careless
and
inattentive
the
same
action
of
the
understanding
has
no
effect
upon
us
nor
is
able
to
convey
any
of
that
satisfaction
which
arises
from
it
when
we
are
in
another
disposition
but
beside
the
action
of
the
mind
which
is
the
principal
foundation
of
the
pleasure
there
is
likewise
required
a
degree
of
success
in
the
attainment
of
the
end
or
the
discovery
of
that
truth
we
examine
upon
this
head
i
shall
make
a
general
remark
which
may
be
useful
on
many
occasions
viz
that
where
the
mind
pursues
any
end
with
passion
though
that
passion
be
not
derived
originally
from
the
end
but
merely
from
the
action
and
pursuit
yet
by
the
natural
course
of
the
affections
we
acquire
a
concern
for
the
end
itself
and
are
uneasy
under
any
disappointment
we
meet
with
in
the
pursuit
of
it
this
proceeds
from
the
relation
and
parallel
direction
of
the
passions
to
illustrate
all
this
by
a
similar
instance
i
shall
observe
that
there
can
not
be
two
passions
more
nearly
resembling
each
other
than
those
of
hunting
and
philosophy
whatever
disproportion
may
at
first
sight
appear
betwixt
them
it
is
evident
that
the
pleasure
of
hunting
conflicts
in
the
action
of
the
mind
and
body
the
motion
the
attention
the
difficulty
and
the
uncertainty
it
is
evident
likewise
that
these
actions
must
be
attended
with
an
idea
of
utility
in
order
to
their
having
any
effect
upon
us
a
man
of
the
greatest
fortune
and
the
farthest
removed
from
avarice
though
he
takes
a
pleasure
in
hunting
after
patridges
and
pheasants
feels
no
satisfaction
in
shooting
crows
and
magpies
and
that
because
he
considers
the
first
as
fit
for
the
table
and
the
other
as
entirely
useless
here
it
is
certain
that
the
utility
or
importance
of
itself
causes
no
real
passion
but
is
only
requisite
to
support
the
imagination
and
the
same
person
who
a
ten
times
greater
profit
in
any
other
subject
is
pleased
to
bring
home
half
a
dozen
woodcocks
or
plovers
after
having
employed
several
hours
in
hunting
after
them
to
make
the
parallel
betwixt
hunting
and
philosophy
more
compleat
we
may
observe
that
though
in
both
cases
the
end
of
our
action
may
in
itself
be
despised
yet
in
the
heat
of
the
action
we
acquire
such
an
attention
to
this
end
that
we
are
very
uneasy
under
any
disappointments
and
are
sorry
when
we
either
miss
our
game
or
fall
into
any
error
in
our
reasoning
if
we
want
another
parallel
to
these
affections
we
may
consider
the
passion
of
gaming
which
affords
a
pleasure
from
the
same
principles
as
hunting
and
philosophy
it
has
been
remarked
that
the
pleasure
of
gaming
arises
not
from
interest
alone
since
many
leave
a
sure
gain
for
this
entertainment
neither
is
it
derived
from
the
game
alone
since
the
same
persons
have
no
satisfaction
when
they
play
for
nothing
but
proceeds
from
both
these
causes
united
though
separately
they
have
no
effect
it
is
here
as
in
certain
chymical
preparations
where
the
mixture
of
two
clear
and
transparent
liquids
produces
a
third
which
is
opaque
and
the
interest
which
we
have
in
any
game
engages
our
attention
without
which
we
can
have
no
enjoyment
either
in
that
or
in
any
other
action
our
attention
being
once
engaged
the
difficulty
variety
and
sudden
reverses
of
fortune
still
farther
interest
us
and
it
is
from
that
concern
our
satisfaction
arises
human
life
is
so
tiresome
a
scene
and
men
generally
are
of
such
indolent
dispositions
that
whatever
amuses
them
though
by
a
passion
mixt
with
pain
does
in
the
main
give
them
a
sensible
pleasure
and
this
pleasure
is
here
encreased
by
the
nature
of
the
objects
which
being
sensible
and
of
a
narrow
compass
are
entered
into
with
facility
and
are
agreeable
to
the
imagination
the
same
theory
that
accounts
for
the
love
of
truth
in
mathematics
and
algebra
may
be
extended
to
morals
politics
natural
philosophy
and
other
studies
where
we
consider
not
the
other
abstract
relations
of
ideas
but
their
real
connexions
and
existence
but
beside
the
love
of
knowledge
which
displays
itself
in
the
sciences
there
is
a
certain
curiosity
implanted
in
human
nature
which
is
a
passion
derived
from
a
quite
different
principle
some
people
have
an
insatiable
desire
of
knowing
the
actions
and
circumstances
of
their
neighbours
though
their
interest
be
no
way
concerned
in
them
and
they
must
entirely
depend
on
others
for
their
information
in
which
case
there
is
no
room
for
study
or
application
let
us
search
for
the
reason
of
this
phaenomenon
it
has
been
proved
at
large
that
the
influence
of
belief
is
at
once
to
inliven
and
infix
any
idea
in
the
imagination
and
prevent
all
kind
of
hesitation
and
uncertainty
about
it
both
these
circumstances
are
advantageous
by
the
vivacity
of
the
idea
we
interest
the
fancy
and
produce
though
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
pleasure
which
arises
from
a
moderate
passion
as
the
vivacity
of
the
idea
gives
pleasure
so
its
certainty
prevents
uneasiness
by
fixing
one
particular
idea
in
the
mind
and
keeping
it
from
wavering
in
the
choice
of
its
objects
it
is
a
quality
of
human
nature
which
is
conspicuous
on
many
occasions
and
is
common
both
to
the
mind
and
body
that
too
sudden
and
violent
a
change
is
unpleasant
to
us
and
that
however
any
objects
may
in
themselves
be
indifferent
yet
their
alteration
gives
uneasiness
as
it
is
the
nature
of
doubt
to
cause
a
variation
in
the
thought
and
transport
us
suddenly
from
one
idea
to
another
it
must
of
consequence
be
the
occasion
of
pain
this
pain
chiefly
takes
place
where
interest
relation
or
the
greatness
and
novelty
of
any
event
interests
us
in
it
it
is
not
every
matter
of
fact
of
which
we
have
a
curiosity
to
be
informed
neither
are
they
such
only
as
we
have
an
interest
to
know
it
is
sufficient
if
the
idea
strikes
on
us
with
such
force
and
concerns
us
so
nearly
as
to
give
us
an
uneasiness
in
its
instability
and
inconstancy
a
stranger
when
he
arrives
first
at
any
town
may
be
entirely
indifferent
about
knowing
the
history
and
adventures
of
the
inhabitants
but
as
he
becomes
farther
acquainted
with
them
and
has
lived
any
considerable
time
among
them
he
acquires
the
same
curiosity
as
the
natives
when
we
are
reading
the
history
of
a
nation
we
may
have
an
ardent
desire
of
clearing
up
any
doubt
or
difficulty
that
occurs
in
it
but
become
careless
in
such
researches
when
the
ideas
of
these
events
are
in
a
great
measure
obliterated
book

moral

not
derived
from

there
is
an
inconvenience
which
attends
all
abstruse
reasoning
that
it
may
silence
without
convincing
an
antagonist
and
requires
the
same
intense
study
to
make
us
sensible
of
its
force
that
was
at

requisite
for
its
invention
when
we
leave

engage

of

its
conclusions
seem
to
vanish
like
the
phantoms
of

night
on

appearance

and
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
retain
even
that
conviction
which
we
had
attained
with
difficulty
this
is
still
more
conspicuous
in
a
long
chain
of
reasoning
where
we
must
preserve
to
the
end
the
evidence
of
the
first
propositions
and
where
we
often
lose
sight
of
all
the
most
received
maxims
either
of

common
life
i
am
not
however
without
hopes
that
the
present
system
of
philosophy
will
acquire
new
force
as
it
advances
and
that
our
reasonings
concerning
morals
will
corroborate
whatever
has
been
said
concerning
the
understanding
and
the
passions
morality
is
a
subject
that
interests
us
above
all
others
we
fancy
the
peace
of
society
to
be
at
stake
in
every
decision
concerning
it
and
it
is
evident
that
this
concern
must
make
our
speculations
appear
more
real
and
solid
than
where
the
subject
is
in
a
great
measure
indifferent
to
us
what
affects
us
we
conclude
can
never
be
a
chimera
and
as
our
passion
is
engaged
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
we
naturally
think
that
the
question
lies
within
human
comprehension
which
in
other
cases
of
this
nature
we
are
apt
to
entertain
some
doubt
of
without
this
advantage
i
never
should
have
ventured
upon
a
third
volume
of
such
abstruse
philosophy
in
an
age
wherein
the
greatest
part
of
men
seem
agreed
to
convert
reading
into
an
amusement
and
to
reject
every
thing
that
requires
any
considerable
degree
of
attention
to
be
comprehended
it
has
been
observed
that
nothing
is
ever
present
to
the
mind
but
its
perceptions
and
that
all
the
actions
of
seeing
hearing
judging
loving
hating
and
thinking
fall
under
this
denomination
the
mind
can
never
exert
itself
in
any
action
which
we
may
not
comprehend
under
the
term
of
perception
and
consequently
that
term
is
no
less
applicable
to
those
judgments
by
which
we
distinguish
moral
good
and
evil
than
to
every
other
operation
of
the
mind
to
approve
of
one
character
to
condemn
another
are
only
so
many
different
perceptions
now
as
perceptions
resolve
themselves
into
two
kinds
viz
impressions
and
ideas
this
distinction
gives
rise
to
a
question
with
which
we
shall
open
up
our
present
enquiry
concerning
morals
whether
it
is
by
means
of
our
ideas
or
impressions
we
distinguish
betwixt
vice
and
virtue
and
pronounce
an
action
blameable
or
praiseworthy
this
will
immediately
cut
off
all
loose
discourses
and
declamations
and
reduce
us
to
something
precise
and
exact
on
the
present
subject
those
who
affirm
that
virtue
is
nothing
but
a
conformity
to
reason
that
there
are
eternal
fitnesses
and
unfitnesses
of
things
which
are
the
same
to
every
rational
being
that
considers
them
that
the
immutable
measures
of
right
and
wrong
impose
an
obligation
not
only
on
human
creatures
but
also
on
the
deity
himself
all
these
systems
concur
in
the
opinion
that
morality
like
truth
is
discerned
merely
by
ideas
and
by
their
and
comparison
in
order
therefore
to
judge
of
these
systems
we
need
only
consider
whether
it
be
possible
from
reason
alone
to
distinguish
betwixt
moral
good
and
evil
or
whether
there
must
concur
some
other
principles
to
enable
us
to
make
that
distinction
if
morality
had
naturally
no
influence
on
human
passions
and
actions
it
were
in
vain
to
take
such
pains
to
inculcate
it
and
nothing
would
be
more
fruitless
than
that
multitude
of
rules
and
precepts
with
which
all
moralists
abound
philosophy
is
commonly
divided
into
speculative
and
practical
and
as
morality
is
always
comprehended
under
the
latter
division
it
is
supposed
to
influence
our
passions
and
actions
and
to
go
beyond
the
calm
and
indolent
judgments
of
the
understanding
and
this
is
confirmed
by
common
experience
which
informs
us
that
men
are
often
governed
by
their
duties
and
are
detered
from
some
actions
by
the
opinion
of
injustice
and
impelled
to
others
by
that
of
obligation
since
morals
therefore
have
an
influence
on
the
actions
and
affections
it
follows
that
they
can
not
be
derived
from
reason
and
that
because
reason
alone
as
we
have
already
proved
can
never
have
any
such
influence
morals
excite
passions
and
produce
or
prevent
actions
reason
of
itself
is
utterly
impotent
in
this
particular
the
rules
of
morality
therefore
are
not
conclusions
of
our
reason
no
one
i
believe
will
deny
the
justness
of
this
inference
nor
is
there
any
other
means
of
evading
it
than
by
denying
that
principle
on
which
it
is
founded
as
long
as
it
is
allowed
that
reason
has
no
influence
on
our
passions
and
action
it
is
in
vain
to
pretend
that
morality
is
discovered
only
by
a
deduction
of
reason
an
active
principle
can
never
be
founded
on
an
inactive
and
if
reason
be
inactive
in
itself
it
must
remain
so
in
all
its
shapes
and
appearances
whether
it
exerts
itself
in
natural
or
moral
subjects
whether
it
considers
the
powers
of
external
bodies
or
the
actions
of
rational
beings
it
would
be
tedious
to
repeat
all
the
arguments
by
which
i
have
proved
book
ii
part
iii
sect
that
reason
is
perfectly
inert
and
can
never
either
prevent
or
produce
any
action
or
affection
it
will
be
easy
to
recollect
what
has
been
said
upon
that
subject
i
shall
only
recall
on
this
occasion
one
of
these
arguments
which
i
shall
endeavour
to
render
still
more
conclusive
and
more
applicable
to
the
present
subject
reason
is
the
discovery
of
truth
or
falshood
truth
or
falshood
consists
in
an
agreement
or
disagreement
either
to
the
real
relations
of
ideas
or
to
real
existence
and
matter
of
fact
whatever
therefore
is
not
susceptible
of
this
agreement
or
disagreement
is
incapable
of
being
true
or
false
and
can
never
be
an
object
of
our
reason
now
it
is
evident
our
passions
volitions
and
actions
are
not
susceptible
of
any
such
agreement
or
disagreement
being
original
facts
and
realities
compleat
in
themselves
and
implying
no
reference
to
other
passions
volitions
and
actions
it
is
impossible
therefore
they
can
be
pronounced
either
true
or
false
and
be
either
contrary
or
conformable
to
reason
this
argument
is
of
double
advantage
to
our
present
purpose
for
it
proves
directly
that
actions
do
not
derive
their
merit
from
a
conformity
to
reason
nor
their
blame
from
a
contrariety
to
it
and
it
proves
the
same
truth
more
indirectly
by
shewing
us
that
as
reason
can
never
immediately
prevent
or
produce
any
action
by
contradicting
or
approving
of
it
it
can
not
be
the
source
of
moral
good
and
evil
which
are
found
to
have
that
influence
actions
may
be
laudable
or
blameable
but
they
can
not
be
reasonable
laudable
or
blameable
therefore
are
not
the
same
with
reasonable
or
unreasonable
the
merit
and
demerit
of
actions
frequently
contradict
and
sometimes
controul
our
natural
propensities
but
reason
has
no
such
influence
moral
distinctions
therefore
are
not
the
offspring
of
reason
reason
is
wholly
inactive
and
can
never
be
the
source
of
so
active
a
principle
as
conscience
or
a
sense
of
morals
but
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
though
no
will
or
action
can
be
immediately
contradictory
to
reason
yet
we
may
find
such
a
contradiction
in
some
of
the
attendants
of
the
action
that
is
in
its
causes
or
effects
the
action
may
cause
a
judgment
or
may
be
obliquely
caused
by
one
when
the
judgment
concurs
with
a
passion
and
by
an
abusive
way
of
speaking
which
philosophy
will
scarce
allow
of
the
same
contrariety
may
upon
that
account
be
ascribed
to
the
action
how
far
this
truth
or
faishood
may
be
the
source
of
morals
it
will
now
be
proper
to
consider
it
has
been
observed
that
reason
in
a
strict
and
philosophical
sense
can
have
influence
on
our
conduct
only
after
two
ways
either
when
it
excites
a
passion
by
informing
us
of
the
existence
of
something
which
is
a
proper
object
of
it
or
when
it
discovers
the
connexion
of
causes
and
effects
so
as
to
afford
us
means
of
exerting
any
passion
these
are
the
only
kinds
of
judgment
which
can
accompany
our
actions
or
can
be
said
to
produce
them
in
any
manner
and
it
must
be
allowed
that
these
judgments
may
often
be
false
and
erroneous
a
person
may
be
affected
with
passion
by
supposing
a
pain
or
pleasure
to
lie
in
an
object
which
has
no
tendency
to
produce
either
of
these
sensations
or
which
produces
the
contrary
to
what
is
imagined
a
person
may
also
take
false
measures
for
the
attaining
his
end
and
may
retard
by
his
foolish
conduct
instead
of
forwarding
the
execution
of
any
project
these
false
judgments
may
be
thought
to
affect
the
passions
and
actions
which
are
connected
with
them
and
may
be
said
to
render
them
unreasonable
in
a
figurative
and
improper
way
of
speaking
but
though
this
be
acknowledged
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
these
errors
are
so
far
from
being
the
source
of
all
immorality
that
they
are
commonly
very
innocent
and
draw
no
manner
of
guilt
upon
the
person
who
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
fail
into
them
they
extend
not
beyond
a
mistake
of
fact
which
moralists
have
not
generally
supposed
criminal
as
being
perfectly
involuntary
i
am
more
to
be
lamented
than
blamed
if
i
am
mistaken
with
regard
to
the
influence
of
objects
in
producing
pain
or
pleasure
or
if
i
know
not
the
proper
means
of
satisfying
my
desires
no
one
can
ever
regard
such
errors
as
a
defect
in
my
moral
character
a
fruit
for
instance
that
is
really
disagreeable
appears
to
me
at
a
distance
and
through
mistake
i
fancy
it
to
be
pleasant
and
delicious
here
is
one
error
i
choose
certain
means
of
reaching
this
fruit
which
are
not
proper
for
my
end
here
is
a
second
error
nor
is
there
any
third
one
which
can
ever
possibly
enter
into
our
reasonings
concerning
actions
i
ask
therefore
if
a
man
in
this
situation
and
guilty
of
these
two
errors
is
to
be
regarded
as
vicious
and
criminal
however
unavoidable
they
might
have
been
or
if
it
be
possible
to
imagine
that
such
errors
are
the
sources
of
all
immorality
and
here
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
that
if
moral
distinctions
be
derived
from
the
truth
or
falshood
of
those
judgments
they
must
take
place
wherever
we
form
the
judgments
nor
will
there
be
any
difference
whether
the
question
be
concerning
an
apple
or
a
kingdom
or
whether
the
error
be
avoidable
or
unavoidable
for
as
the
very
essence
of
morality
is
supposed
to
consist
in
an
agreement
or
disagreement
to
reason
the
other
circumstances
are
entirely
arbitrary
and
can
never
either
bestow
on
any
action
the
character
of
virtuous
or
vicious
or
deprive
it
of
that
character
to
which
we
may
add
that
this
agreement
or
disagreement
not
admitting
of
degrees
all
virtues
and
vices
would
of
course
be
equal
should
it
be
pretended
that
though
a
mistake
of
fact
be
not
criminal
yet
a
mistake
of
right
often
is
and
that
this
may
be
the
source
of
immorality
i
would
answer
that
it
is
impossible
such
a
mistake
can
ever
be
the
original
source
of
immorality
since
it
supposes
a
real
right
and
wrong
that
is
a
real
distinction
in
morals
independent
of
these
judgments
a
mistake
therefore
of
right
may
become
a
species
of
immorality
but
it
is
only
a
secondary
one
and
is
founded
on
some
other
antecedent
to
it
as
to
those
judgments
which
are
the
effects
of
our
actions
and
which
when
false
give
occasion
to
pronounce
the
actions
contrary
to
truth
and
reason
we
may
observe
that
our
actions
never
cause
any
judgment
either
true
or
false
in
ourselves
and
that
it
is
only
on
others
they
have
such
an
influence
it
is
certain
that
an
action
on
many
occasions
may
give
rise
to
false
conclusions
in
others
and
that
a
person
who
through
a
window
sees
any
lewd
behaviour
of
mine
with
my
neighbour
wife
may
be
so
simple
as
to
imagine
she
is
certainly
my
own
in
this
respect
my
action
resembles
somewhat
a
lye
or
falshood
only
with
this
difference
which
is
material
that
i
perform
not
the
action
with
any
intention
of
giving
rise
to
a
false
judgment
in
another
but
merely
to
satisfy
my
lust
and
passion
it
causes
however
a
mistake
and
false
judgment
by
accident
and
the
falshood
of
its
effects
may
be
ascribed
by
some
odd
figurative
way
of
speaking
to
the
action
itself
but
still
i
can
see
no
pretext
of
reason
for
asserting
that
the
tendency
to
cause
such
an
error
is
the
first
spring
or
original
source
of
all
immorality
footnote
one
might
think
it
were
entirely
superfluous
to
prove

a

william

who
has
had
the
good

is
the
foundation
of
all
guilt

moral
deformity
that
we
may
discover
the
fallacy
of

we
need
only
consider
that
a
false
conclusion
is
drawn
from
an
action
only
by
means
of
an
obscurity
of
natural
principles
which
makes
a

were
the

is
in

to

that
inanimate

act
without
liberty
and

for
as
liberty
and
choice
are
not
necessary
to
make
an
action
produce
in
us
an
erroneous
conclusion
they
can
be
in
no
respect
essential
to
morality
and
i
do
not
readily
perceive
upon
this
system
how
they
can
ever
come
to
be
regarded
by
it
if
the
tendency
to
cause
error
be
the
origin
of
immorality
that
tendency
and
immorality
would
in
every
case
be
inseparable
add
to
this
that
if
i
had
used
the
precaution
of
shutting
the
windows
while
i
indulged
myself
in
those
liberties
with
my
neighbour
wife
i
should
have
been
guilty
of
no
immorality
and
that
because
my
action
being
perfectly
concealed
would
have
had
no
tendency
to
produce
any
false
conclusion
for
the
same
reason
a
thief
who
steals
in
by
a
ladder
at
a
window
and
takes
all
imaginable
care
to
cause
no
disturbance
is
in
no
respect
criminal
for
either
he
will
not
be
perceived
or
if
he
be
it
is
impossible
he
can
produce
any
error
nor
will
any
one
from
these
circumstances
take
him
to
be
other
than
what
he
really
is
it
is
well
known
that
those
who
are
do
very
readily
cause
mistakes
in
others
and
that
we
imagine
they
salute
or
are
talking
to
one
person
while
they
address
themselves
to
anther
are
they
therefore
upon
that
account
immoral
besides
we
may
easily
observe
that
in
all
those
arguments
there
is
an
evident
reasoning
in
a
circle
a
person
who
takes
possession
of
another
goods
and
uses
them
as
his
own
in
a
manner
declares
them
to
be
his
own
and
this
falshood
is
the
source
of
the
immorality
of
injustice
but
is
property
or
right
or
obligation
intelligible
without
an
antecedent
morality
a
man
that
is
ungrateful
to
his
benefactor
in
a
manner
affirms
that
he
never
received
any
favours
from
him
but
in
what
manner
is
it
because
it
is
his
duty
to
be
grateful
but
this
supposes
that
there
is
some
antecedent
rule
of
duty
and
morals
is
it
because
human
nature
is
generally
grateful
and
makes
us
conclude
that
a
man
who
does
any
harm
never
received
any
favour
from
the
person
he
harmed
but
human
nature
is
not
so
generally
grateful
as
to
justify
such
a
conclusion
or
if
it
were
is
an
exception
to
a
general
rule
in
every
case
criminal
for
no
other
reason
than
because
it
is
an
exception
but
what
may
suffice
entirely
to
destroy
this
whimsical
system
is
that
it
leaves
us
under
the
same
difficulty
to
give
a
reason
why
truth
is
virtuous
and
falshood
vicious
as
to
account
for
the
merit
or
turpitude
of
any
other
action
i
shall
allow
if
you
please
that
all
immorality
is
derived
from
this
supposed
falshood
in
action
provided
you
can
give
me
any
plausible
reason
why
such
a
falshood
is
immoral
if
you
consider
rightly
of
the
matter
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
same
difficulty
as
at
the
beginning
this
last
argument
is
very
conclusive
because
if
there
be
not
an
evident
merit
or
turpitude
annexed
to
this
species
of
truth
or
falahood
it
can
never
have
any
influence
upon
our
actions
for
who
ever
thought
of
forbearing
any
action
because
others
might
possibly
draw
false
conclusions
from
it
or
who
ever
performed
any
that
he
might
give
rise
to
true
conclusions
thus
upon
the
whole
it
is
impossible
that
the
distinction
betwixt
moral
good
and
evil
can
be
made
to
reason
since
that
distinction
has
an
influence
upon
our
actions
of
which
reason
alone
is
incapable
reason
and
judgment
may
indeed
be
the
mediate
cause
of
an
action
by
prompting
or
by
directing
a
passion
but
it
is
not
pretended
that
a
judgment
of
this
kind
either
in
its
truth
or
falshood
is
attended
with
virtue
or
vice
and
as
to
the
judgments
which
are
caused
by
our
judgments
they
can
still
less
bestow
those
moral
qualities
on
the
actions
which
are
their
causes
but
to
be
more
particular
and
to
shew
that
those
eternal
immutable
fitnesses
and
unfitnesses
of
things
can
not
be
defended
by
sound
philosophy
we
may
weigh
the
following
considerations
if
the
thought
and
understanding
were
alone
capable
of
fixing
the
boundaries
of
right
and
wrong
the
character
of
virtuous
and
vicious
either
must
lie
in
some
relations
of
objects
or
must
be
a
matter
of
fact
which
is
discovered
by
our
reasoning
this
consequence
is
evident
as
the
operations
of
human
understanding
divide
themselves
into
two
kinds
the
comparing
of
ideas
and
the
inferring
of
matter
of
fact
were
virtue
discovered
by
the
understanding
it
must
be
an
object
of
one
of
these
operations
nor
is
there
any
third
operation
of
the
understanding
which
can
discover
it
there
has
been
an
opinion
very
industriously
propagated
by
certain
philosophers
that
morality
is
susceptible
of
demonstration
and
though
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
advance
a
single
step
in
those
demonstrations
yet
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
this
science
may
be
brought
to
an
equal
certainty
with
geometry
or
algebra
upon
this
supposition
vice
and
virtue
must
consist
in
some
relations
since
it
is
allowed
on
all
hands
that
no
matter
of
fact
is
capable
of
being
demonstrated
let
us
therefore
begin
with
examining
this
hypothesis
and
endeavour
if
possible
to
fix
those
moral
qualities
which
have
been
so
long
the
objects
of
our
fruitless
researches
point
out
distinctly
the
relations
which
constitute
morality
or
obligation
that
we
may
know
wherein
they
consist
and
after
what
manner
we
must
judge
of
them
if
you
assert
that
vice
and
virtue
consist
in
relations
susceptible
of
certainty
and
demonstration
you
must
confine
yourself
to
those
four
relations
which
alone
admit
of
that
degree
of
evidence
and
in
that
case
you
run
into
absurdities
from
which
you
will
never
be
able
to
extricate
yourself
for
as
you
make
the
very
essence
of
morality
to
lie
in
the
relations
and
as
there
is
no
one
of
these
relations
but
what
is
applicable
not
only
to
an
irrational
but
also
to
an
inanimate
object
it
follows
that
even
such
objects
must
be
susceptible
of
merit
or
demerit
resemblance
contrariety
degrees
in
quality
and
proportions
in
quantity
and
number
all
these
relations
belong
as
properly
to
matter
as
to
our
actions
passions
and
volitions
it
is
unquestionable
therefore
that
morality
lies
not
in
any
of
these
relations
nor
the
sense
of
it
in
their
discovery
footnote
as
a
proof
how
confused
our
way
of
thinking
on
this
subject
commonly
is
we
may
observe
that
those
who
assert
that
morality
is
demonstrable
do
not
say
that
morality
lies
in
the
relations
and
that
the
relations
are
distinguishable
by
reason
they
only
say
that
reason
can
discover
such
an
action
in
such
relations
to
be
virtuous
and
such
another
vicious
it
seems
they
thought
it
sufficient
if
they
could
bring
the
word
relation
into
the
proposition
without
troubling
themselves
whether
it
was
to
the
purpose
or
not
but
here
i
think
is
plain
argument
demonstrative
reason
discovers
only
relations
but
that
reason
according
to
this
hypothesis
discovers
also
vice
and
virtue
these
moral
qualities
therefore
must
be
relations
when
we
blame
any
action
in
any
situation
the
whole
complicated
object
of
action
and
situation
must
form
certain
relations
wherein
the
essence
of
vice
consists
this
hypothesis
is
not
otherwise
intelligible
for
what
does
reason
discover
when
it
pronounces
any
action
vicious
does
it
discover
a
relation
or
a
matter
of
fact
these
questions
are
decisive
and
must
not
be
eluded
should
it
be
asserted
that
the
sense
of
morality
consists
in
the
discovery
of
some
relation
distinct
from
these
and
that
our
enumeration
was
not
compleat
when
we
comprehended
all
demonstrable
relations
under
four
general
heads
to
this
i
know
not
what
to
reply
till
some
one
be
so
good
as
to
point
out
to
me
this
new
relation
it
is
impossible
to
refute
a
system
which
has
never
yet
been
explained
in
such
a
manner
of
fighting
in
the
dark
a
man
loses
his
blows
in
the
air
and
often
places
them
where
the
enemy
is
not
present
i
must
therefore
on
this
occasion
rest
contented
with
requiring
the
two
following
conditions
of
any
one
that
would
undertake
to
clear
up
this
system
first
as
moral
good
and
evil
belong
only
to
the
actions
of
the
mind
and
are
derived
from
our
situation
with
regard
to
external
objects
the
relations
from
which
these
moral
distinctions
arise
must
lie
only
betwixt
internal
actions
and
external
objects
and
must
not
be
applicable
either
to
internal
actions
compared
among
themselves
or
to
external
objects
when
placed
in
opposition
to
other
external
objects
for
as
morality
is
supposed
to
attend
certain
relations
if
these
relations
coued
belong
to
internal
actions
considered
singly
it
would
follow
that
we
might
be
guilty
of
crimes
in
ourselves
and
independent
of
our
situation
with
respect
to
the
universe
and
in
like
manner
if
these
moral
relations
coued
be
applied
to
external
objects
it
would
follow
that
even
inanimate
beings
would
be
susceptible
of
moral
beauty
and
deformity
now
it
seems
difficult
to
imagine
that
any
relation
can
be
discovered
betwixt
our
passions
volitions
and
actions
compared
to
external
objects
which
relation
might
not
belong
either
to
these
passions
and
volitions
or
to
these
external
objects
compared
among
themselves
but
it
will
be
still
more
difficult
to
fulfil
the
second
condition
requisite
to
justify
this
system
according
to
the
principles
of
those
who
maintain
an
abstract
rational
difference
betwixt
moral
good
and
evil
and
a
natural
fitness
and
unfitness
of
things
it
is
not
only
supposed
that
these
relations
being
eternal
and
immutable
are
the
same
when
considered
by
every
rational
creature
but
their
effects
are
also
supposed
to
be
necessarily
the
same
and
it
is
concluded
they
have
no
less
or
rather
a
greater
influence
in
directing
the
will
of
the
deity
than
in
governing
the
rational
and
virtuous
of
our
own
species
these
two
particulars
are
evidently
distinct
it
is
one
thing
to
know
virtue
and
another
to
conform
the
will
to
it
in
order
therefore
to
prove
that
the
measures
of
right
and
wrong
are
eternal
laws
obligatory
on
every
rational
mind
it
is
not
sufficient
to
shew
the
relations
upon
which
they
are
founded
we
must
also
point
out
the
connexion
betwixt
the
relation
and
the
will
and
must
prove
that
this
connexion
is
so
necessary
that
in
every
mind
it
must
take
place
and
have
its
influence
though
the
difference
betwixt
these
minds
be
in
other
respects
immense
and
infinite
now
besides
what
i
have
already
proved
that
even
in
human
nature
no
relation
can
ever
alone
produce
any
action
besides
this
i
say
it
has
been
shewn
in
treating
of
the
understanding
that
there
is
no
connexion
of
cause
and
effect
such
as
this
is
supposed
to
be
which
is
discoverable
otherwise
than
by
experience
and
of
which
we
can
pretend
to
have
any
security
by
the
simple
consideration
of
the
objects
all
beings
in
the
universe
considered
in
themselves
appear
entirely
loose
and
independent
of
each
other
it
is
only
by
experience
we
learn
their
influence
and
connexion
and
this
influence
we
ought
never
to
extend
beyond
experience
thus
it
will
be
impossible
to
fulfil
the
first
condition
required
to
the
system
of
eternal
measures
of
right
and
wrong
because
it
is
impossible
to
shew
those
relations
upon
which
such
a
distinction
may
be
founded
and
it
is
as
impossible
to
fulfil
the
second
condition
because
we
can
not
prove
a
priori
that
these
relations
if
they
really
existed
and
were
perceived
would
be
universally
forcible
and
obligatory
but
to
make
these
general
reflections
more
dear
and
convincing
we
may
illustrate
them
by
some
particular
instances
wherein
this
character
of
moral
good
or
evil
is
the
most
universally
acknowledged
of
all
crimes
that
human
creatures
are
capable
of
committing
the
most
horrid
and
unnatural
is
ingratitude
especially
when
it
is
committed
against
parents
and
appears
in
the
more
flagrant
instances
of
wounds
and
death
this
is
acknowledged
by
all
mankind
philosophers
as
well
as
the
people
the
question
only
arises
among
philosophers
whether
the
guilt
or
moral
deformity
of
this
action
be
discovered
by
demonstrative
reasoning
or
be
felt
by
an
internal
sense
and
by
means
of
some
sentiment
which
the
reflecting
on
such
an
action
naturally
occasions
this
question
will
soon
be
decided
against
the
former
opinion
if
we
can
shew
the
same
relations
in
other
objects
without
the
notion
of
any
guilt
or
iniquity
attending
them
reason
or
science
is
nothing
but
the
comparing
of
ideas
and
the
discovery
of
their
relations
and
if
the
same
relations
have
different
characters
it
must
evidently
follow
that
those
characters
are
not
discovered
merely
by
reason
to
put
the
affair
therefore
to
this
trial
let
us
chuse
any
inanimate
object
such
as
an
oak
or
elm
and
let
us
suppose
that
by
the
dropping
of
its
seed
it
produces
a
sapling
below
it
which
springing
up
by
degrees
at
last
overtops
and
destroys
the
parent
tree
i
ask
if
in
this
instance
there
be
wanting
any
relation
which
is
discoverable
in
parricide
or
ingratitude
is
not
the
one
tree
the
cause
of
the
other
existence
and
the
latter
the
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
former
in
the
same
manner
as
when
a
child
murders
his
parent
it
is
not
sufficient
to
reply
that
a
choice
or
will
is
wanting
for
in
the
case
of
parricide
a
will
does
not
give
rise
to
any
different
relations
but
is
only
the
cause
from
which
the
action
is
derived
and
consequently
produces
the
same
relations
that
in
the
oak
or
elm
arise
from
some
other
principles
it
is
a
will
or
choice
that
determines
a
man
to
kill
his
parent
and
they
are
the
laws
of
matter
and
motion
that
determine
a
sapling
to
destroy
the
oak
from
which
it
sprung
here
then
the
same
relations
have
different
causes
but
still
the
relations
are
the
same
and
as
their
discovery
is
not
in
both
cases
attended
with
a
notion
of
immorality
it
follows
that
that
notion
does
not
arise
from
such
a
discovery
but
to
chuse
an
instance
still
more
resembling
i
would
fain
ask
any
one
why
incest
in
the
human
species
is
criminal
and
why
the
very
same
action
and
the
same
relations
in
animals
have
not
the
smallest
moral
turpitude
and
deformity
if
it
be
answered
that
this
action
is
innocent
in
animals
because
they
have
not
reason
sufficient
to
discover
its
turpitude
but
that
man
being
endowed
with
that
faculty
which
ought
to
restrain
him
to
his
duty
the
same
action
instantly
becomes
criminal
to
him
should
this
be
said
i
would
reply
that
this
is
evidently
arguing
in
a
circle
for
before
reason
can
perceive
this
turpitude
the
turpitude
must
exist
and
consequently
is
independent
of
the
decisions
of
our
reason
and
is
their
object
more
properly
than
their
effect
according
to
this
system
then
every
animal
that
has
sense
and
appetite
and
will
that
is
every
animal
must
be
susceptible
of
all
the
same
virtues
and
vices
for
which
we
ascribe
praise
and
blame
to
human
creatures
all
the
difference
is
that
our
superior
reason
may
serve
to
discover
the
vice
or
virtue
and
by
that
means
may
augment
the
blame
or
praise
but
still
this
discovery
supposes
a
separate
being
in
these
moral
distinctions
and
a
being
which
depends
only
on
the
will
and
appetite
and
which
both
in
thought
and
reality
may
be
distinguished
from
the
reason
animals
are
susceptible
of
the
same
relations
with
respect
to
each
other
as
the
human
species
and
therefore
would
also
be
susceptible
of
the
same
morality
if
the
essence
of
morality
consisted
in
these
relations
their
want
of
a
sufficient
degree
of
reason
may
hinder
them
from
perceiving
the
duties
and
obligations
of
morality
but
can
never
hinder
these
duties
from
existing
since
they
must
antecedently
exist
in
order
to
their
being
perceived
reason
must
find
them
and
can
never
produce
them
this
argument
deserves
to
be
weighed
as
being
in
my
opinion
entirely
decisive
nor
does
this
reasoning
only
prove
that
morality
consists
not
in
any
relations
that
are
the
objects
of
science
but
if
examined
will
prove
with
equal
certainty
that
it
consists
not
in
any
matter
of
fact
which
can
be
discovered
by
the
understanding
this
is
the
second
part
of
our
argument
and
if
it
can
be
made
evident
we
may
conclude
that
morality
is
not
an
object
of
reason
but
can
there
be
any
difficulty
in
proving
that
vice
and
virtue
are
not
matters
of
fact
whose
existence
we
can
infer
by
reason
take
any
action
allowed
to
be
vicious
wilful
murder
for
instance
examine
it
in
all
lights
and
see
if
you
can
find
that
matter
of
fact
or
real
existence
which
you
call
vice
in
way
you
take
it
you
find
only
certain
passions
motives
volitions
and
thoughts
there
is
no
other
matter
of
fact
in
the
case
the
vice
entirely
escapes
you
as
long
as
you
consider
the
object
you
never
can
find
it
till
you
turn
your
reflection
into
your
own
breast
and
find
a
sentiment
of
disapprobation
which
arises
in
you
towards
this
action
here
is
a
matter
of
fact
but
it
is
the
object
of
feeling
not
of
reason
it
lies
in
yourself
not
in
the
object
so
that
when
you
pronounce
any
action
or
character
to
be
vicious
you
mean
nothing
but
that
from
the
constitution
of
your
nature
you
have
a
feeling
or
sentiment
of
blame
from
the
contemplation
of
it
vice
and
virtue
therefore
may
be
compared
to
sounds
colours
heat
and
cold
which
according
to
modern
philosophy
are
not
qualities
in
objects
but
perceptions
in
the
mind
and
this
discovery
in
morals
like
that
other
in
physics
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
considerable
advancement
of
the
speculative
sciences
though
like
that
too
it
has
little
or
no
influence
on
practice
nothing
can
be
more
real
or
concern
us
more
than
our
own
sentiments
of
pleasure
and
uneasiness
and
if
these
be
favourable
to
virtue
and
unfavourable
to
vice
no
more
can
be
requisite
to
the
regulation
of
our
conduct
and
behaviour
i
can
not
forbear
adding
to
these
reasonings
an
observation
which
may
perhaps
be
found
of
some
importance
in
every
system
of
morality
which
i
have
hitherto
met
with
i
have
always
remarked
that
the
author
proceeds
for
some
time
in
the
ordinary
way
of
reasoning
and
establishes
the
being
of
a
god
or
makes
observations
concerning
human
affairs
when
of
a
sudden
i
am
surprized
to
find
that
instead
of
the
usual
copulations
of
propositions
is
and
is
not
i
meet
with
no
proposition
that
is
not
connected
with
an
ought
or
an
ought
not
this
change
is
imperceptible
but
is
however
of
the
last
consequence
for
as
this
ought
or
ought
not
expresses
some
new
relation
or
affirmation
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
observed
and
explained
and
at
the
same
time
that
a
reason
should
be
given
for
what
seems
altogether
inconceivable
how
this
new
relation
can
be
a
deduction
from
others
which
are
entirely
different
from
it
but
as
authors
do
not
commonly
use
this
precaution
i
shall
presume
to
recommend
it
to
the
readers
and
am
persuaded
that
this
small
attention
would
subvert
all
the
vulgar
systems
of
morality
and
let
us
see
that
the
distinction
of
vice
and
virtue
is
not
founded
merely
on
the
relations
of
objects
nor
is
perceived
by
reason
sect
ii
moral
distinctions
derived
from
a
moral
sense
thus
the
course
of
the
argument
leads
us
to
conclude
that
since
vice
and
virtue
are
not
discoverable
merely
by
reason
or
the
comparison
of
ideas
it
must
be
by
means
of
some
impression
or
sentiment
they
occasion
that
we
are
able
to
mark
the
difference
betwixt
them
our
decisions
concerning
moral
rectitude
and
depravity
are
evidently
perceptions
and
as
all
perceptions
are
either
impressions
or
ideas
the
exclusion
of
the
one
is
a
convincing
argument
for
the
other
morality
therefore
is
more
properly
felt
than
judged
of
though
this
feeling
or
sentiment
is
commonly
so
soft
and
gentle
that
we
are
apt
to
confound
it
with
an
idea
according
to
our
common
custom
of
taking
all
things
for
the
same
which
have
any
near
resemblance
to
each
other
the
next
question
is
of
what
nature
are
these
impressions
and
after
what
manner
do
they
operate
upon
us
here
we
can
not
remain
long
in
suspense
but
must
pronounce
the
impression
arising
from
virtue
to
be
agreeable
and
that
proceding
from
vice
to
be
uneasy
every
moments
experience
must
convince
us
of
this
there
is
no
spectacle
so
fair
and
beautiful
as
a
noble
and
generous
action
nor
any
which
gives
us
more
abhorrence
than
one
that
is
cruel
and
treacherous
no
enjoyment
equals
the
satisfaction
we
receive
from
the
company
of
those
we
love
and
esteem
as
the
greatest
of
all
punishments
is
to
be
obliged
to
pass
our
lives
with
those
we
hate
or
contemn
a
very
play
or
romance
may
afford
us
instances
of
this
pleasure
which
virtue
conveys
to
us
and
pain
which
arises
from
vice
now
since
the
distinguishing
impressions
by
which
moral
good
or
evil
is
known
are
nothing
but
particular
pains
or
pleasures
it
follows
that
in
all
enquiries
concerning
these
moral
distinctions
it
will
be
sufficient
to
shew
the
principles
which
make
us
feel
a
satisfaction
or
uneasiness
from
the
survey
of
any
character
in
order
to
satisfy
us
why
the
character
is
laudable
or
blameable
an
action
or
sentiment
or
character
is
virtuous
or
vicious
why
because
its
view
causes
a
pleasure
or
uneasiness
of
a
particular
kind
in
giving
a
reason
therefore
for
the
pleasure
or
uneasiness
we
sufficiently
explain
the
vice
or
virtue
to
have
the
sense
of
virtue
is
nothing
but
to
feel
a
satisfaction
of
a
particular
kind
from
the
contemplation
of
a
character
the
very
feeling
constitutes
our
praise
or
admiration
we
go
no
farther
nor
do
we
enquire
into
the
cause
of
the
satisfaction
we
do
not
infer
a
character
to
be
virtuous
because
it
pleases
but
in
feeling
that
it
pleases
after
such
a
particular
manner
we
in
effect
feel
that
it
is
virtuous
the
case
is
the
same
as
in
our
judgments
concerning
all
kinds
of
beauty
and
tastes
and
sensations
our
approbation
is
implyed
in
the
immediate
pleasure
they
convey
to
us
i
have
objected
to
the
system
which
establishes
eternal
rational
measures
of
right
and
wrong
that
it
is
impossible
to
shew
in
the
actions
of
reasonable
creatures
any
relations
which
are
not
found
in
external
objects
and
therefore
if
morality
always
attended
these
relations
it
were
possible
for
inanimate
matter
to
become
virtuous
or
vicious
now
it
may
in
like
manner
be
objected
to
the
present
system
that
if
virtue
and
vice
be
determined
by
pleasure
and
pain
these
qualities
must
in
every
case
arise
from
the
sensations
and
consequently
any
object
whether
animate
or
inanimate
rational
or
irrational
might
become
morally
good
or
evil
provided
it
can
excite
a
satisfaction
or
uneasiness
but
though
this
objection
seems
to
be
the
very
same
it
has
by
no
means
the
same
force
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
for
first
tis
evident
that
under
the
term
pleasure
we
comprehend
sensations
which
are
very
different
from
each
other
and
which
have
only
such
a
distant
resemblance
as
is
requisite
to
make
them
be
expressed
by
the
same
abstract
term
a
good
composition
of
music
and
a
bottle
of
good
wine
equally
produce
pleasure
and
what
is
more
their
goodness
is
determined
merely
by
the
pleasure
but
shall
we
say
upon
that
account
that
the
wine
is
harmonious
or
the
music
of
a
good
flavour
in
like
manner
an
inanimate
object
and
the
character
or
sentiments
of
any
person
may
both
of
them
give
satisfaction
but
as
the
satisfaction
is
different
this
keeps
our
sentiments
concerning
them
from
being
confounded
and
makes
us
ascribe
virtue
to
the
one
and
not
to
the
other
nor
is
every
sentiment
of
pleasure
or
pain
which
arises
from
characters
and
actions
of
that
peculiar
kind
which
makes
us
praise
or
condemn
the
good
qualities
of
an
enemy
are
hurtful
to
us
but
may
still
command
our
esteem
and
respect
it
is
only
when
a
character
is
considered
in
general
without
reference
to
our
particular
interest
that
it
causes
such
a
feeling
or
sentiment
as
denominates
it
morally
good
or
evil
it
is
true
those
sentiments
from
interest
and
morals
are
apt
to
be
confounded
and
naturally
run
into
one
another
it
seldom
happens
that
we
do
not
think
an
enemy
vicious
and
can
distinguish
betwixt
his
opposition
to
our
interest
and
real
villainy
or
baseness
but
this
hinders
not
but
that
the
sentiments
are
in
themselves
distinct
and
a
man
of
temper
and
judgment
may
preserve
himself
from
these
illusions
in
like
manner
though
it
is
certain
a
musical
voice
is
nothing
but
one
that
naturally
gives
a
particular
kind
of
pleasure
yet
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
be
sensible
that
the
voice
of
an
enemy
is
agreeable
or
to
allow
it
to
be
musical
but
a
person
of
a
fine
ear
who
has
the
command
of
himself
can
separate
these
feelings
and
give
praise
to
what
deserves
it
secondly
we
may
call
to
remembrance
the
preceding
system
of
the
passions
in
order
to
remark
a
still
more
considerable
difference
among
our
pains
and
pleasures
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
are
excited
when
there
is
any
thing
presented
to
us
that
both
bears
a
relation
to
the
object
of
the
passion
and
produces
a
separate
sensation
related
to
the
sensation
of
the
passion
now
virtue
and
vice
are
attended
with
these
circumstances
they
must
necessarily
be
placed
either
in
ourselves
or
others
and
excite
either
pleasure
or
uneasiness
and
therefore
must
give
rise
to
one
of
these
four
passions
which
clearly
distinguishes
them
from
the
pleasure
and
pain
arising
from
inanimate
objects
that
often
bear
no
relation
to
us
and
this
is
perhaps
the
most
considerable
effect
that
virtue
and
vice
have
upon
the
human
mind
it
may
now
be
asked
in
general
concerning
this
pain
or
pleasure
that
distinguishes
moral
good
and
evil
from
what
principles
is
it
derived
and
whence
does
it
arise
in
the
human
mind
to
this
i
reply
first
that
it
is
absurd
to
imagine
that
in
every
particular
instance
these
sentiments
are
produced
by
an
original
quality
and
primary
constitution
for
as
the
number
of
our
duties
is
in
a
manner
infinite
it
is
impossible
that
our
original
instincts
should
extend
to
each
of
them
and
from
our
very
first
infancy
impress
on
the
human
mind
all
that
multitude
of
precepts
which
are
contained
in
the
compleatest
system
of
ethics
such
a
method
of
proceeding
is
not
conformable
to
the
usual
maxims
by
which
nature
is
conducted
where
a
few
principles
produce
all
that
variety
we
observe
in
the
universe
and
every
thing
is
carryed
on
in
the
easiest
and
most
simple
manner
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
abridge
these
primary
impulses
and
find
some
more
general
principles
upon
which
all
our
notions
of
morals
are
founded
but
in
the
second
place
should
it
be
asked
whether
we
ought
to
search
for
these
principles
in
nature
or
whether
we
must
look
for
them
in
some
other
origin
i
would
reply
that
our
answer
to
this
question
depends
upon
the
definition
of
the
word
nature
than
which
there
is
none
more
ambiguous
and
equivocal
if
nature
be
opposed
to
miracles
not
only
the
distinction
betwixt
vice
and
virtue
is
natural
but
also
every
event
which
has
ever
happened
in
the
world
excepting
those
miracles
on
which
our
religion
is
founded
in
saying
then
that
the
sentiments
of
vice
and
virtue
are
natural
in
this
sense
we
make
no
very
extraordinary
discovery
but
nature
may
also
be
opposed
to
rare
and
unusual
and
in
this
sense
of
the
word
which
is
the
common
one
there
may
often
arise
disputes
concerning
what
is
natural
or
unnatural
and
one
may
in
general
affirm
that
we
are
not
possessed
of
any
very
precise
standard
by
which
these
disputes
can
be
decided
frequent
and
rare
depend
upon
the
number
of
examples
we
have
observed
and
as
this
number
may
gradually
encrease
or
diminish
it
will
be
impossible
to
fix
any
exact
boundaries
betwixt
them
we
may
only
affirm
on
this
head
that
if
ever
there
was
any
thing
which
coued
be
called
natural
in
this
sense
the
sentiments
of
morality
certainly
may
since
there
never
was
any
nation
of
the
world
nor
any
single
person
in
any
nation
who
was
utterly
deprived
of
them
and
who
never
in
any
instance
shewed
the
least
approbation
or
dislike
of
manners
these
sentiments
are
so
rooted
in
our
constitution
and
temper
that
without
entirely
confounding
the
human
mind
by
disease
or
madness
it
is
impossible
to
extirpate
and
destroy
them
but
nature
may
also
be
opposed
to
artifice
as
well
as
to
what
is
rare
and
unusual
and
in
this
sense
it
may
be
disputed
whether
the
notions
of
virtue
be
natural
or
not
we
readily
forget
that
the
designs
and
projects
and
views
of
men
are
principles
as
necessary
in
their
operation
as
heat
and
cold
moist
and
dry
but
taking
them
to
be
free
and
entirely
our
own
it
is
usual
for
us
to
set
them
in
opposition
to
the
other
principles
of
nature
should
it
therefore
be
demanded
whether
the
sense
of
virtue
be
natural
or
artificial
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
at
present
to
give
any
precise
answer
to
this
question
perhaps
it
will
appear
afterwards
that
our
sense
of
some
virtues
is
artificial
and
that
of
others
natural
the
discussion
of
this
question
will
be
more
proper
when
we
enter
upon
an
exact
detail
of
each
particular
vice
and
virtue
footnote
in
the
following
discourse
natural
is
also
opposed
sometimes
to
civil
sometimes
to
moral
the
opposition
will
always
discover
the
sense
in
which
it
is
taken
mean
while
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
observe
from
these
definitions
of
natural
and
unnatural
that
nothing
can
be
more
unphilosophical
than
those
systems
which
assert
that
virtue
is
the
same
with
what
is
natural
and
vice
with
what
is
unnatural
for
in
the
first
sense
of
the
word
nature
as
opposed
to
miracles
both
vice
and
virtue
are
equally
natural
and
in
the
second
sense
as
opposed
to
what
is
unusual
perhaps
virtue
will
be
found
to
be
the
most
unnatural
at
least
it
must
be
owned
that
heroic
virtue
being
as
unusual
is
as
little
natural
as
the
most
brutal
barbarity
as
to
the
third
sense
of
the
word
it
is
certain
that
both
vice
and
virtue
are
equally
artificial
and
out
of
nature
for
however
it
may
be
disputed
whether
the
notion
of
a
merit
or
demerit
in
certain
actions
be
natural
or
artificial
it
is
evident
that
the
actions
themselves
are
artificial
and
are
performed
with
a
certain
design
and
intention
otherwise
they
coued
never
be
ranked
under
any
of
these
denominations
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
the
character
of
natural
and
unnatural
can
ever
in
any
sense
mark
the
boundaries
of
vice
and
virtue
thus
we
are
still
brought
back
to
our
first
position
that
virtue
is
distinguished
by
the
pleasure
and
vice
by
the
pain
that
any
action
sentiment
or
character
gives
us
by
the
mere
view
and
contemplation
this
decision
is
very
commodious
because
it
reduces
us
to
this
simple
question
why
any
action
or
sentiment
upon
the
general
view
or
survey
gives
a
certain
satisfaction
or
uneasiness
in
order
to
shew
the
origin
of
its
moral
rectitude
or
depravity
without
looking
for
any
incomprehensible
relations
and
qualities
which
never
did
exist
in
nature
nor
even
in
our
imagination
by
any
clear
and
distinct
conception
i
flatter
myself
i
have
executed
a
great
part
of
my
present
design
by
a
state
of
the
question
which
appears
to
me
so
free
from
ambiguity
and
obscurity
part
ii
of
justice
and
injustice
sect
i
justice
whether
a
natural
or
artificial
virtue
i
have
already
hinted
that
our
sense
of
every
kind
of
virtue
is
not
natural
but
that
there
are
some
virtues
that
produce
pleasure
and
approbation
by
means
of
an
artifice
or
contrivance
which
arises
from
the
circumstances
and
necessity
of
mankind
of
this
kind
i
assert
justice
to
be
and
shall
endeavour
to
defend
this
opinion
by
a
short
and
i
hope
convincing
argument
before
i
examine
the
nature
of
the
artifice
from
which
the
sense
of
that
virtue
is
derived
it
is
evident
that
when
we
praise
any
actions
we
regard
only
the
motives
that
produced
them
and
consider
the
actions
as
signs
or
indications
of
certain
principles
in
the
mind
and
temper
the
external
performance
has
no
merit
we
must
look
within
to
find
the
moral
quality
this
we
can
not
do
directly
and
therefore
fix
our
attention
on
actions
as
on
external
signs
but
these
actions
are
still
considered
as
signs
and
the
ultimate
object
of
our
praise
and
approbation
is
the
motive
that
produced
them
after
the
same
manner
when
we
require
any
action
or
blame
a
person
for
not
performing
it
we
always
suppose
that
one
in
that
situation
should
be
influenced
by
the
proper
motive
of
that
action
and
we
esteem
it
vicious
in
him
to
be
regardless
of
it
if
we
find
upon
enquiry
that
the
virtuous
motive
was
still
powerful
over
his
breast
though
checked
in
its
operation
by
some
circumstances
unknown
to
us
we
retract
our
blame
and
have
the
same
esteem
for
him
as
if
he
had
actually
performed
the
action
which
we
require
of
him
it
appears
therefore
that
all
virtuous
actions
derive
their
merit
only
from
virtuous
motives
and
are
considered
merely
as
signs
of
those
motives
from
this
principle
i
conclude
that
the
first
virtuous
motive
which
bestows
a
merit
on
any
action
can
never
be
a
regard
to
the
virtue
of
that
action
but
must
be
some
other
natural
motive
or
principle
to
suppose
that
the
mere
regard
to
the
virtue
of
the
action
may
be
the
first
motive
which
produced
the
action
and
rendered
it
virtuous
is
to
reason
in
a
circle
before
we
can
have
such
a
regard
the
action
must
be
really
virtuous
and
this
virtue
must
be
derived
from
some
virtuous
motive
and
consequently
the
virtuous
motive
must
be
different
from
the
regard
to
the
virtue
of
the
action
a
virtuous
motive
is
requisite
to
render
an
action
virtuous
an
action
must
be
virtuous
before
we
can
have
a
regard
to
its
virtue
some
virtuous
motive
therefore
must
be
antecedent
to
that
regard
nor
is
this
merely
a
metaphysical
subtilty
but
enters
into
all
our
reasonings
in
common
life
though
perhaps
we
may
not
be
able
to
place
it
in
such
distinct
philosophical
terms
we
blame
a
father
for
neglecting
his
child
why
because
it
shews
a
want
of
natural
affection
which
is
the
duty
of
every
parent
were
not
natural
affection
a
duty
the
care
of
children
coued
not
be
a
duty
and
it
were
impossible
we
coued
have
the
duty
in
our
eye
in
the
attention
we
give
to
our
offspring
in
this
case
therefore
all
men
suppose
a
motive
to
the
action
distinct
from
a
sense
of
duty
here
is
a
man
that
does
many
benevolent
actions
relieves
the
distressed
comforts
the
afflicted
and
extends
his
bounty
even
to
the
greatest
strangers
no
character
can
be
more
amiable
and
virtuous
we
regard
these
actions
as
proofs
of
the
greatest
humanity
this
humanity
bestows
a
merit
on
the
actions
a
regard
to
this
merit
is
therefore
a
secondary
consideration
and
derived
from
the
antecedent
principle
of
humanity
which
is
meritorious
and
laudable
in
short
it
may
be
established
as
an
undoubted
maxim
that
no
action
can
be
virtuous
or
morally
good
unless
there
be
in
human
nature
some
motive
to
produce
it
distinct
from
the
sense
of
its
morality
but
may
not
the
sense
of
morality
or
duty
produce
an
action
without
any
other
motive
i
answer
it
may
but
this
is
no
objection
to
the
present
doctrine
when
any
virtuous
motive
or
principle
is
common
in
human
nature
a
person
who
feels
his
heart
devoid
of
that
motive
may
hate
himself
upon
that
account
and
may
perform
the
action
without
the
motive
from
a
certain
sense
of
duty
in
order
to
acquire
by
practice
that
virtuous
principle
or
at
least
to
disguise
to
himself
as
much
as
possible
his
want
of
it
a
man
that
really
feels
no
gratitude
in
his
temper
is
still
pleased
to
perform
grateful
actions
and
thinks
he
has
by
that
means
fulfilled
his
duty
actions
are
at
first
only
considered
as
signs
of
motives
but
it
is
usual
in
this
case
as
in
all
others
to
fix
our
attention
on
the
signs
and
neglect
in
some
measure
the
thing
signifyed
but
though
on
some
occasions
a
person
may
perform
an
action
merely
out
of
regard
to
its
moral
obligation
yet
still
this
supposes
in
human
nature
some
distinct
principles
which
are
capable
of
producing
the
action
and
whose
moral
beauty
renders
the
action
meritorious
now
to
apply
all
this
to
the
present
case
i
suppose
a
person
to
have
lent
me
a
sum
of
money
on
condition
that
it
be
restored
in
a
few
days
and
also
suppose
that
after
the
expiration
of
the
term
agreed
on
he
demands
the
sum
i
ask
what
reason
or
motive
have
i
to
restore
the
money
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
my
regard
to
justice
and
abhorrence
of
villainy
and
knavery
are
sufficient
reasons
for
me
if
i
have
the
least
grain
of
honesty
or
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
and
this
answer
no
doubt
is
just
and
satisfactory
to
man
in
his
civilized
state
and
when
trained
up
according
to
a
certain
discipline
and
education
but
in
his
rude
and
more
natural
condition
if
you
are
pleased
to
call
such
a
condition
natural
this
answer
would
be
rejected
as
perfectly
unintelligible
and
sophistical
for
one
in
that
situation
would
immediately
ask
you
wherein
consists
this
honesty
and
justice
which
you
find
in
restoring
a
loan
and
abstaining
from
the
property
of
others
it
does
not
surely
lie
in
the
external
action
it
must
therefore
be
placed
in
the
motive
from
which
the
external
action
is
derived
this
motive
can
never
be
a
regard
to
the
honesty
of
the
action
for
it
is
a
plain
fallacy
to
say
that
a
virtuous
motive
is
requisite
to
render
an
action
honest
and
at
the
same
time
that
a
regard
to
the
honesty
is
the
motive
of
the
action
we
can
never
have
a
regard
to
the
virtue
of
an
action
unless
the
action
be
antecedently
virtuous
no
action
can
be
virtuous
but
so
far
as
it
proceeds
from
a
virtuous
motive
a
virtuous
motive
therefore
must
precede
the
regard
to
the
virtue
and
it
is
impossible
that
the
virtuous
motive
and
the
regard
to
the
virtue
can
be
the
same
it
is
requisite
then
to
find
some
motive
to
acts
of
justice
and
honesty
distinct
from
our
regard
to
the
honesty
and
in
this
lies
the
great
difficulty
for
should
we
say
that
a
concern
for
our
private
interest
or
reputation
is
the
legitimate
motive
to
all
honest
actions
it
would
follow
that
wherever
that
concern
ceases
honesty
can
no
longer
have
place
but
it
is
certain
that
when
it
acts
at
its
liberty
instead
of
engaging
us
to
honest
actions
is
the
source
of
all
injustice
and
violence
nor
can
a
man
ever
correct
those
vices
without
correcting
and
restraining
the
natural
movements
of
that
appetite
but
should
it
be
affirmed
that
the
reason
or
motive
of
such
actions
is
the
regard
to
publick
interest
to
which
nothing
is
more
contrary
than
examples
of
injustice
and
dishonesty
should
this
be
said
i
would
propose
the
three
following
considerations
as
worthy
of
our
attention
first
public
interest
is
not
naturally
attached
to
the
observation
of
the
rules
of
justice
but
is
only
connected
with
it
after
an
artificial
convention
for
the
establishment
of
these
rules
as
shall
be
shewn
more
at
large
hereafter
secondly
if
we
suppose
that
the
loan
was
secret
and
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
interest
of
the
person
that
the
money
be
restored
in
the
same
manner
as
when
the
lender
would
conceal
his
riches
in
that
case
the
example
ceases
and
the
public
is
no
longer
interested
in
the
actions
of
the
borrower
though
i
suppose
there
is
no
moralist
who
will
affirm
that
the
duty
and
obligation
ceases
thirdly
experience
sufficiently
proves
that
men
in
the
ordinary
conduct
of
life
look
not
so
far
as
the
public
interest
when
they
pay
their
creditors
perform
their
promises
and
abstain
from
theft
and
robbery
and
injustice
of
every
kind
that
is
a
motive
too
remote
and
too
sublime
to
affect
the
generality
of
mankind
and
operate
with
any
force
in
actions
so
contrary
to
private
interest
as
are
frequently
those
of
justice
and
common
honesty
in
general
it
may
be
affirmed
that
there
is
no
such
passion
in
human
minds
as
the
love
of
mankind
merely
as
such
independent
of
personal
qualities
of
services
or
of
relation
to
ourseit
it
is
true
there
is
no
human
and
indeed
no
sensible
creature
whose
happiness
or
misery
does
not
in
some
measure
affect
us
when
brought
near
to
us
and
represented
in
lively
colours
but
this
proceeds
merely
from
sympathy
and
is
no
proof
of
such
an
universal
affection
to
mankind
since
this
concern
extends
itself
beyond
our
own
species
an
affection
betwixt
the
sexes
is
a
passion
evidently
implanted
in
human
nature
and
this
passion
not
only
appears
in
its
peculiar
symptoms
but
also
in
inflaming
every
other
principle
of
affection
and
raising
a
stronger
love
from
beauty
wit
kindness
than
what
would
otherwise
flow
from
them
were
there
an
universal
love
among
all
human
creatures
it
would
appear
after
the
same
manner
any
degree
of
a
good
quality
would
cause
a
stronger
affection
than
the
same
degree
of
a
bad
quality
would
cause
hatred
contrary
to
what
we
find
by
experience
men
tempers
are
different
and
some
have
a
propensity
to
the
tender
and
others
to
the
rougher
affections
but
in
the
main
we
may
affirm
that
man
in
general
or
human
nature
is
nothing
but
the
object
both
of
love
and
hatred
and
requires
some
other
cause
which
by
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
may
excite
these
passions
in
vain
would
we
endeavour
to
elude
this
hypothesis
there
are
no
phaenomena
that
point
out
any
such
kind
affection
to
men
independent
of
their
merit
and
every
other
circumstance
we
love
company
in
general
but
it
is
as
we
love
any
other
amusement
an
englishman
in
italy
is
a
friend
a
euro
paean
in
china
and
perhaps
a
man
would
be
beloved
as
such
were
we
to
meet
him
in
the
moon
but
this
proceeds
only
from
the
relation
to
ourselves
which
in
these
cases
gathers
force
by
being
confined
to
a
few
persons
if
public
benevolence
therefore
or
a
regard
to
the
interests
of
mankind
can
not
be
the
original
motive
to
justice
much
less
can
private
benevolence
or
a
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
party
concerned
be
this
motive
for
what
if
he
be
my
enemy
and
has
given
me
just
cause
to
hate
him
what
if
he
be
a
vicious
man
and
deserves
the
hatred
of
all
mankind
what
if
he
be
a
miser
and
can
make
no
use
of
what
i
would
deprive
him
of
what
if
he
be
a
profligate
debauchee
and
would
rather
receive
harm
than
benefit
from
large
possessions
what
if
i
be
in
necessity
and
have
urgent
motives
to
acquire
something
to
my
family
in
all
these
cases
the
original
motive
to
justice
would
fail
and
consequently
the
justice
itself
and
along
with
it
all
property
tight
and
obligation
a
rich
man
lies
under
a
moral
obligation
to
communicate
to
those
in
necessity
a
share
of
his
superfluities
were
private
benevolence
the
original
motive
to
justice
a
man
would
not
be
obliged
to
leave
others
in
the
possession
of
more
than
he
is
obliged
to
give
them
at
least
the
difference
would
be
very
inconsiderable
men
generally
fix
their
affections
more
on
what
they
are
possessed
of
than
on
what
they
never
enjoyed
for
this
reason
it
would
be
greater
cruelty
to
dispossess
a
man
of
any
thing
than
not
to
give
it
him
but
who
will
assert
that
this
is
the
only
foundation
of
justice
besides
we
must
consider
that
the
chief
reason
why
men
attach
themselves
so
much
to
their
possessions
is
that
they
consider
them
as
their
property
and
as
secured
to
them
inviolably
by
the
laws
of
society
but
this
is
a
secondary
consideration
and
dependent
on
the
preceding
notions
of
justice
and
property
a
man
property
is
supposed
to
be
fenced
against
every
mortal
in
every
possible
case
but
private
benevolence
is
and
ought
to
be
weaker
in
some
persons
than
in
others
and
in
many
or
indeed
in
most
persons
must
absolutely
fail
private
benevolence
therefore
is
not
the
original
motive
of
justice
from
all
this
it
follows
that
we
have
no
real
or
universal
motive
for
observing
the
laws
of
equity
but
the
very
equity
and
merit
of
that
observance
and
as
no
action
can
be
equitable
or
meritorious
where
it
can
not
arise
from
some
separate
motive
there
is
here
an
evident
sophistry
and
reasoning
in
a
circle
unless
therefore
we
will
allow
that
nature
has
established
a
sophistry
and
rendered
it
necessary
and
unavoidable
we
must
allow
that
the
sense
of
justice
and
injustice
is
not
derived
from
nature
but
arises
artificially
though
necessarily
from
education
and
human
conventions
i
shall
add
as
a
corollary
to
this
reasoning
that
since
no
action
can
be
laudable
or
blameable
without
some
motives
or
impelling
passions
distinct
from
the
sense
of
morals
these
distinct
passions
must
have
a
great
influence
on
that
sense
it
is
according
to
their
general
force
in
human
nature
that
we
blame
or
praise
in
judging
of
the
beauty
of
animal
bodies
we
always
carry
in
our
eye
the
oeconomy
of
a
certain
species
and
where
the
limbs
and
features
observe
that
proportion
which
is
common
to
the
species
we
pronounce
them
handsome
and
beautiful
in
like
manner
we
always
consider
the
natural
and
usual
force
of
the
passions
when
we
determine
concerning
vice
and
virtue
and
if
the
passions
depart
very
much
from
the
common
measures
on
either
side
they
are
always
disapproved
as
vicious
a
man
naturally
loves
his
children
better
than
his
nephews
his
nephews
better
than
his
cousins
his
cousins
better
than
strangers
where
every
thing
else
is
equal
hence
arise
our
common
measures
of
duty
in
preferring
the
one
to
the
other
our
sense
of
duty
always
follows
the
common
and
natural
course
of
our
passions
to
avoid
giving
offence
i
must
here
observe
that
when
i
deny
justice
to
be
a
natural
virtue
i
make
use
of
the
word
natural
only
as
opposed
to
artificial
in
another
sense
of
the
word
as
no
principle
of
the
human
mind
is
more
natural
than
a
sense
of
virtue
so
no
virtue
is
more
natural
than
justice
mankind
is
an
inventive
species
and
where
an
invention
is
obvious
and
absolutely
necessary
it
may
as
properly
be
said
to
be
natural
as
any
thing
that
proceeds
immediately
from
original
principles
without
the
intervention
of
thought
or
reflection
though
the
rules
of
justice
be
artificial
they
are
not
arbitrary
nor
is
the
expression
improper
to
call
them
laws
of
nature
if
by
natural
we
understand
what
is
common
to
any
species
or
even
if
we
confine
it
to
mean
what
is
inseparable
from
the
species
sect
ii
of
the
origin
of
justice
and
property
we
now
proceed
to
examine
two
questions
viz
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
rules
of
justice
are
established
by
the
artifice
of
men
and
concerning
the
reasons
which
determine
us
to
attribute
to
the
observance
or
neglect
of
these
rules
a
moral
beauty
and
deformity
these
questions
will
appear
afterwards
to
be
distinct
we
shall
begin
with
the
former
of
all
the
animals
with
which
this
globe
is
peopled
there
is
none
towards
whom
nature
seems
at
first
sight
to
have
exercised
more
cruelty
than
towards
man
in
the
numberless
wants
and
necessities
with
which
she
has
loaded
him
and
in
the
slender
means
which
she
affords
to
the
relieving
these
necessities
in
other
creatures
these
two
particulars
generally
compensate
each
other
if
we
consider
the
lion
as
a
voracious
and
carnivorous
animal
we
shall
easily
discover
him
to
be
very
necessitous
but
if
we
turn
our
eye
to
his
make
and
temper
his
agility
his
courage
his
arms
and
his
force
we
shall
find
that
his
advantages
hold
proportion
with
his
wants
the
sheep
and
ox
are
deprived
of
all
these
advantages
but
their
appetites
are
moderate
and
their
food
is
of
easy
purchase
in
man
alone
this
unnatural
conjunction
of
infirmity
and
of
necessity
may
be
observed
in
its
greatest
perfection
not
only
the
food
which
is
required
for
his
sustenance
flies
his
search
and
approach
or
at
least
requires
his
labour
to
be
produced
but
he
must
be
possessed
of
cloaths
and
lodging
to
defend
him
against
the
injuries
of
the
weather
though
to
consider
him
only
in
himself
he
is
provided
neither
with
arms
nor
force
nor
other
natural
abilities
which
are
in
any
degree
answerable
to
so
many
necessities
it
is
by
society
alone
he
is
able
to
supply
his
defects
and
raise
himself
up
to
an
equality
with
his
and
even
acquire
a
superiority
above
them
by
society
all
his
infirmities
are
compensated
and
though
in
that
situation
his
wants
multiply
every
moment
upon
him
yet
his
abilities
are
still
more
augmented
and
leave
him
in
every
respect
more
satisfied
and
happy
than
it
is
possible
for
him
in
his
savage
and
solitary
condition
ever
to
become
when
every
individual
person
labours
and
only
for
himself
his
force
is
too
small
to
execute
any
considerable
work
his
labour
being
employed
in
supplying
all
his
different
necessities
he
never
attains
a
perfection
in
any
particular
art
and
as
his
force
and
success
are
not
at
all
times
equal
the
least
failure
in
either
of
these
particulars
must
be
attended
with
inevitable
ruin
and
misery
society
provides
a
remedy
for
these
three
inconveniences
by
the
conjunction
of
forces
our
power
is
augmented
by
the
partition
of
employments
our
ability
encreases
and
by
mutual
succour
we
are
less
exposed
to
fortune
and
accidents
it
is
by
this
additional
force
ability
and
security
that
society
becomes
advantageous
but
in
order
to
form
society
it
is
requisite
not
only
that
it
be
advantageous
but
also
that
men
be
sensible
of
these
advantages
and
it
is
impossible
in
their
wild
uncultivated
state
that
by
study
and
reflection
alone
they
should
ever
be
able
to
attain
this
knowledge
most
fortunately
therefore
there
is
conjoined
to
those
necessities
whose
remedies
are
remote
and
obscure
another
necessity
which
having
a
present
and
more
obvious
remedy
may
justly
be
regarded
as
the
first
and
original
principle
of
human
society
this
necessity
is
no
other
than
that
natural
appetite
betwixt
the
sexes
which
unites
them
together
and
preserves
their
union
till
a
new
tye
takes
place
in
their
concern
for
their
common
offspring
this
new
concern
becomes
also
a
principle
of
union
betwixt
the
parents
and
offspring
and
forms
a
more
numerous
society
where
the
parents
govern
by
the
advantage
of
their
superior
strength
and
wisdom
and
at
the
same
time
are
restrained
in
the
exercise
of
their
authority
by
that
natural
affection
which
they
bear
their
children
in
a
little
time
custom
and
habit
operating
on
the
tender
minds
of
the
children
makes
them
sensible
of
the
advantages
which
they
may
reap
from
society
as
well
as
fashions
them
by
degrees
for
it
by
rubbing
off
those
rough
corners
and
untoward
affections
which
prevent
their
coalition
for
it
must
be
confest
that
however
the
circumstances
of
human
nature
may
render
an
union
necessary
and
however
those
passions
of
lust
and
natural
affection
may
seem
to
render
it
unavoidable
yet
there
are
other
particulars
in
our
natural
temper
and
in
our
outward
circumstances
which
are
very
incommodious
and
are
even
contrary
to
the
requisite
conjunction
among
the
former
we
may
justly
esteem
our
selfishness
to
be
the
most
considerable
i
am
sensible
that
generally
speaking
the
representations
of
this
quality
have
been
carried
much
too
far
and
that
the
descriptions
which
certain
philosophers
delight
so
much
to
form
of
mankind
in
this
particular
are
as
wide
of
nature
as
any
accounts
of
monsters
which
we
meet
with
in
fables
and
romances
so
far
from
thinking
that
men
have
no
affection
for
any
thing
beyond
themselves
i
am
of
opinion
that
though
it
be
rare
to
meet
with
one
who
loves
any
single
person
better
than
himself
yet
it
is
as
rare
to
meet
with
one
in
whom
all
the
kind
affections
taken
together
do
not
overbalance
all
the
selfish
consult
common
experience
do
you
not
see
that
though
the
whole
expence
of
the
family
be
generally
under
the
direction
of
the
master
of
it
yet
there
are
few
that
do
not
bestow
the
largest
part
of
their
fortunes
on
the
pleasures
of
their
wives
and
the
education
of
their
children
reserving
the
smallest
portion
for
their
own
proper
use
and
entertainment
this
is
what
we
may
observe
concerning
such
as
have
those
endearing
ties
and
may
presume
that
the
case
would
be
the
same
with
others
were
they
placed
in
a
like
situation
but
though
this
generosity
must
be
acknowledged
to
the
honour
of
human
nature
we
may
at
the
same
time
remark
that
so
noble
an
affection
instead
of
fitting
men
for
large
societies
is
almost
as
contrary
to
them
as
the
most
narrow
selfishness
for
while
each
person
loves
himself
better
than
any
other
single
person
and
in
his
love
to
others
bears
the
greatest
affection
to
his
relations
and
acquaintance
this
must
necessarily
produce
an
oppositon
of
passions
and
a
consequent
opposition
of
actions
which
can
not
but
be
dangerous
to
the
union
it
is
however
worth
while
to
remark
that
this
contrariety
of
passions
would
be
attended
with
but
small
danger
did
it
not
concur
with
a
peculiarity
in
our
outward
circumstances
which
affords
it
an
opportunity
of
exerting
itself
there
are
different
species
of
goods
which
we
are
possessed
of
the
internal
satisfaction
of
our
minds
the
external
advantages
of
our
body
and
the
enjoyment
of
such
possessions
as
we
have
acquired
by
our
industry
and
good
fortune
we
are
perfectly
secure
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
first
the
second
may
be
ravished
from
us
but
can
be
of
no
advantage
to
him
who
deprives
us
of
them
the
last
only
are
both
exposed
to
the
violence
of
others
and
may
be
transferred
without
suffering
any
loss
or
alteration
while
at
the
same
time
there
is
not
a
sufficient
quantity
of
them
to
supply
every
one
desires
and
necessities
as
the
improvement
therefore
of
these
goods
is
the
chief
advantage
of
society
so
the
instability
of
their
possession
along
with
their
scarcity
is
the
chief
impediment
in
vain
should
we
expect
to
find
in
uncultivated
nature
a
remedy
to
this
inconvenience
or
hope
for
any
inartificial
principle
of
the
human
mind
which
might
controul
those
partial
affections
and
make
us
overcome
the
temptations
arising
from
our
circumstances
the
idea
of
justice
can
never
serve
to
this
purpose
or
be
taken
for
a
natural
principle
capable
of
inspiring
men
with
an
equitable
conduct
towards
each
other
that
virtue
as
it
is
now
understood
would
never
have
been
dreamed
of
among
rude
and
savage
men
for
the
notion
of
injury
or
injustice
implies
an
immorality
or
vice
committed
against
some
other
person
and
as
every
immorality
is
derived
from
some
defect
or
unsoundness
of
the
passions
and
as
this
defect
must
be
judged
of
in
a
great
measure
from
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
in
the
constitution
of
the
mind
it
will
be
easy
to
know
whether
we
be
guilty
of
any
immorality
with
regard
to
others
by
considering
the
natural
and
usual
force
of
those
several
affections
which
are
directed
towards
them
now
it
appears
that
in
the
original
frame
of
our
mind
our
strongest
attention
is
confined
to
ourselves
our
next
is
extended
to
our
relations
and
acquaintance
and
it
is
only
the
weakest
which
reaches
to
strangers
and
indifferent
persons
this
partiality
then
and
unequal
affection
must
not
only
have
an
influence
on
our
behaviour
and
conduct
in
society
but
even
on
our
ideas
of
vice
and
virtue
so
as
to
make
us
regard
any
remarkable
transgression
of
such
a
degree
of
partiality
either
by
too
great
an
enlargement
or
contraction
of
the
affections
as
vicious
and
immoral
this
we
may
observe
in
our
common
judgments
concerning
actions
where
we
blame
a
person
who
either
centers
all
his
affections
in
his
family
or
is
so
regardless
of
them
as
in
any
opposition
of
interest
to
give
the
preference
to
a
stranger
or
mere
chance
acquaintance
from
all
which
it
follows
that
our
natural
uncultivated
ideas
of
morality
instead
of
providing
a
remedy
for
the
partiality
of
our
affections
do
rather
conform
themselves
to
that
partiality
and
give
it
an
additional
force
and
influence
the
remedy
then
is
not
derived
from
nature
but
from
artifice
or
more
e
properly
speaking
nature
provides
a
remedy
in
the
judgment
and
understanding
for
what
is
irregular
and
incommodious
in
the
affections
for
when
men
from
their
early
education
in
society
have
become
sensible
of
the
infinite
advantages
that
result
from
it
and
have
besides
acquired
a
new
affection
to
company
and
conversation
and
when
they
have
observed
that
the
principal
disturbance
in
society
arises
from
those
goods
which
we
call
external
and
from
their
looseness
and
easy
transition
from
one
person
to
another
they
must
seek
for
a
remedy
by
putting
these
goods
as
far
as
possible
on
the
same
footing
with
the
fixed
and
constant
advantages
of
the
mind
and
body
this
can
be
done
after
no
other
manner
than
by
a
convention
entered
into
by
all
the
members
of
the
society
to
bestow
stability
on
the
possession
of
those
external
goods
and
leave
every
one
in
the
peaceable
enjoyment
of
what
he
may
acquire
by
his
fortune
and
industry
by
this
means
every
one
knows
what
he
may
safely
possess
and
the
passions
ale
restrained
in
their
partial
and
contradictory
motions
nor
is
such
a
restraint
contrary
to
these
passions
for
if
so
it
coued
never
be
entered
into
nor
maintained
but
it
is
only
contrary
to
their
heedless
and
impetuous
movement
instead
of
departing
from
our
own
interest
or
from
that
of
our
nearest
friends
by
abstaining
from
the
possessions
of
others
we
can
not
better
consult
both
these
interests
than
by
such
a
convention
because
it
is
by
that
means
we
maintain
society
which
is
so
necessary
to
their
and
subsistence
as
well
as
to
our
own
this
convention
is
not
of
the
nature
of
a
promise
for
even
promises
themselves
as
we
shall
see
afterwards
arise
from
human
conventions
it
is
only
a
general
sense
of
common
interest
which
sense
all
the
members
of
the
society
express
to
one
another
and
which
induces
them
to
regulate
their
conduct
by
certain
rules
i
observe
that
it
will
be
for
my
interest
to
leave
another
in
the
possession
of
his
goods
provided
he
will
act
in
the
same
manner
with
regard
to
me
he
is
sensible
of
a
like
interest
in
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
when
this
common
sense
of
interest
is
mutually
expressed
and
is
known
to
both
it
produces
a
suitable
resolution
and
behaviour
and
this
may
properly
enough
be
called
a
convention
or
agreement
betwixt
us
though
without
the
interposition
of
a
promise
since
the
actions
of
each
of
us
have
a
reference
to
those
of
the
other
and
are
performed
upon
the
supposition
that
something
is
to
be
performed
on
the
other
part
two
men
who
pull
the
oars
of
a
boat
do
it
by
an
agreement
or
convention
though
they
have
never
given
promises
to
each
other
nor
is
the
rule
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
the
less
derived
from
human
conventions
that
it
arises
gradually
and
acquires
force
by
a
slow
progression
and
by
our
repeated
experience
of
the
inconveniences
of
transgressing
it
on
the
contrary
this
experience
assures
us
still
more
that
the
sense
of
interest
has
become
common
to
all
our
fellows
and
gives
us
a
confidence
of
the
future
regularity
of
their
conduct
and
it
is
only
on
the
expectation
of
this
that
our
moderation
and
abstinence
are
founded
in
like
manner
are
languages
gradually
established
by
human
conventions
without
any
promise
in
like
manner
do
gold
and
silver
become
the
common
measures
of
exchange
and
are
esteemed
sufficient
payment
for
what
is
of
a
hundred
times
their
value
after
this
convention
concerning
abstinence
from
the
possessions
of
others
is
entered
into
and
every
one
has
acquired
a
stability
in
his
possessions
there
immediately
arise
the
ideas
of
justice
and
injustice
as
also
those
of
property
right
and
obligation
the
latter
are
altogether
unintelligible
without
first
understanding
the
former
our
property
is
nothing
but
those
goods
whose
constant
possession
is
established
by
the
laws
of
society
that
is
by
the
laws
of
justice
those
therefore
who
make
use
of
the
words
property
or
right
or
obligation
before
they
have
explained
the
origin
of
justice
or
even
make
use
of
them
in
that
explication
are
guilty
of
a
very
gross
fallacy
and
can
never
reason
upon
any
solid
foundation
a
property
is
some
object
related
to
him
this
relation
is
not
natural
but
moral
and
founded
on
justice
it
is
very
preposterous
therefore
to
imagine
that
we
can
have
any
idea
of
property
without
fully
comprehending
the
nature
of
justice
and
shewing
its
origin
in
the
artifice
and
contrivance
of
man
the
origin
of
justice
explains
that
of
property
the
same
artifice
gives
rise
to
both
as
our
first
and
most
natural
sentiment
of
morals
is
founded
on
the
nature
of
our
passions
and
gives
the
preference
to
ourselves
and
friends
above
strangers
it
is
impossible
there
can
be
naturally
any
such
thing
as
a
fixed
right
or
property
while
the
opposite
passions
of
men
impel
them
in
contrary
directions
and
are
not
restrained
by
any
convention
or
agreement
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
convention
for
the
distinction
of
property
and
for
the
stability
of
possession
is
of
all
circumstances
the
most
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
human
society
and
that
after
the
agreement
for
the
fixing
and
observing
of
this
rule
there
remains
little
or
nothing
to
be
done
towards
settling
a
perfect
harmony
and
concord
all
the
other
passions
besides
this
of
interest
are
either
easily
restrained
or
are
not
of
such
pernicious
consequence
when
indulged
vanity
is
rather
to
be
esteemed
a
social
passion
and
a
bond
of
union
among
men
pity
and
love
are
to
be
considered
in
the
same
light
and
as
to
envy
and
revenge
though
pernicious
they
operate
only
by
intervals
and
are
directed
against
particular
persons
whom
we
consider
as
our
superiors
or
enemies
this
avidity
alone
of
acquiring
goods
and
possessions
for
ourselves
and
our
nearest
friends
is
insatiable
perpetual
universal
and
directly
destructive
of
society
there
scarce
is
any
one
who
is
not
actuated
by
it
and
there
is
no
one
who
has
not
reason
to
fear
from
it
when
it
acts
without
any
restraint
and
gives
way
to
its
first
and
most
natural
movements
so
that
upon
the
whole
we
are
to
esteem
the
difficulties
in
the
establishment
of
society
to
be
greater
or
less
according
to
those
we
encounter
in
regulating
and
restraining
this
passion
it
is
certain
that
no
affection
of
the
human
mind
has
both
a
sufficient
force
and
a
proper
direction
to
counterbalance
the
love
of
gain
and
render
men
fit
members
of
society
by
making
them
abstain
from
the
possessions
of
others
benevolence
to
strangers
is
too
weak
for
this
purpose
and
as
to
the
other
passions
they
rather
inflame
this
avidity
when
we
observe
that
the
larger
our
possessions
are
the
more
ability
we
have
of
gratifying
all
our
appetites
there
is
no
passion
therefore
capable
of
controlling
the
interested
affection
but
the
very
affection
itself
by
an
alteration
of
its
direction
now
this
alteration
must
necessarily
take
place
upon
the
least
reflection
since
it
is
evident
that
the
passion
is
much
better
satisfyed
by
its
restraint
than
by
its
liberty
and
that
in
preserving
society
we
make
much
greater
advances
in
the
acquiring
possessions
than
in
the
solitary
and
forlorn
condition
which
must
follow
upon
violence
and
an
universal
licence
the
question
therefore
concerning
the
wickedness
or
goodness
of
human
nature
enters
not
in
the
least
into
that
other
question
concerning
the
origin
of
society
nor
is
there
any
thing
to
be
considered
but
the
degrees
of
men
sagacity
or
folly
for
whether
the
passion
of
be
esteemed
vicious
or
virtuous
it
is
all
a
case
since
itself
alone
restrains
it
so
that
if
it
be
virtuous
men
become
social
by
their
virtue
if
vicious
their
vice
has
the
same
effect
now
as
it
is
by
establishing
the
rule
for
the
stability
of
possession
that
this
passion
restrains
itself
if
that
rule
be
very
abstruse
and
of
difficult
invention
society
must
be
esteemed
in
a
manner
accidental
and
the
effect
of
many
ages
but
if
it
be
found
that
nothing
can
be
more
simple
and
obvious
than
that
rule
that
every
parent
in
order
to
preserve
peace
among
his
children
must
establish
it
and
that
these
first
rudiments
of
justice
must
every
day
be
improved
as
the
society
enlarges
if
all
this
appear
evident
as
it
certainly
must
we
may
conclude
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
men
to
remain
any
considerable
time
in
that
savage
condition
which
precedes
society
but
that
his
very
first
state
and
situation
may
justly
be
esteemed
social
this
however
hinders
not
but
that
philosophers
may
if
they
please
extend
their
reasoning
to
the
supposed
state
of
nature
provided
they
allow
it
to
be
a
mere
philosophical
fiction
which
never
had
and
never
coued
have
any
reality
human
nature
being
composed
of
two
principal
parts
which
are
requisite
in
all
its
actions
the
affections
and
understanding
it
is
certain
that
the
blind
motions
of
the
former
without
the
direction
of
the
latter
incapacitate
men
for
society
and
it
may
be
allowed
us
to
consider
separately
the
effects
that
result
from
the
separate
operations
of
these
two
component
parts
of
the
mind
the
same
liberty
may
be
permitted
to
moral
which
is
allowed
to
natural
philosophers
and
it
is
very
usual
with
the
latter
to
consider
any
motion
as
compounded
and
consisting
of
two
parts
separate
from
each
other
though
at
the
same
time
they
acknowledge
it
to
be
in
itself
uncompounded
and
inseparable
this
state
of
nature
therefore
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
mere
fiction
not
unlike
that
of
the
golden
age
which
poets
have
invented
only
with
this
difference
that
the
former
is
described
as
full
of
war
violence
and
injustice
whereas
the
latter
is
pointed
out
to
us
as
the
most
charming
and
most
peaceable
condition
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
the
seasons
in
that
first
age
of
nature
were
so
temperate
if
we
may
believe
the
poets
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
men
to
provide
themselves
with
cloaths
and
houses
as
a
security
against
the
violence
of
heat
and
cold
the
rivers
flowed
with
wine
and
milk
the
oaks
yielded
honey
and
nature
spontaneously
produced
her
greatest
delicacies
nor
were
these
the
chief
advantages
of
that
happy
age
the
storms
and
tempests
were
not
alone
removed
from
nature
but
those
more
furious
tempests
were
unknown
to
human
breasts
which
now
cause
such
uproar
and
engender
such
confusion
avarice
ambition
cruelty
selfishness
were
never
heard
of
cordial
affection
compassion
sympathy
were
the
only
movements
with
which
the
human
mind
was
yet
acquainted
even
the
distinction
of
mine
and
thine
was
banished
from
that
happy
race
of
mortals
and
carryed
with
them
the
very
notions
of
property
and
obligation
justice
and
injustice
this
no
doubt
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
idle
fiction
but
yet
deserves
our
attention
because
nothing
can
more
evidently
shew
the
origin
of
those
virtues
which
are
the
subjects
of
our
present
enquiry
i
have
already
observed
that
justice
takes
its
rise
from
human
conventions
and
that
these
are
intended
as
a
remedy
to
some
inconveniences
which
proceed
from
the
concurrence
of
certain
qualities
of
the
human
mind
with
the
situation
of
external
objects
the
qualities
of
the
mind
are
selfishness
and
limited
generosity
and
the
situation
of
external
objects
is
their
easy
change
joined
to
their
scarcity
in
comparison
of
the
wants
and
desires
of
men
but
however
philosophers
may
have
been
bewildered
in
those
speculations
poets
have
been
guided
more
infallibly
by
a
certain
taste
or
common
instinct
which
in
most
kinds
of
reasoning
goes
farther
than
any
of
that
art
and
philosophy
with
which
we
have
been
yet
acquainted
they
easily
perceived
if
every
man
had
a
tender
regard
for
another
or
if
nature
supplied
abundantly
all
our
wants
and
desires
that
the
jealousy
of
interest
which
justice
supposes
could
no
longer
have
place
nor
would
there
be
any
occasion
for
those
distinctions
and
limits
of
property
and
possession
which
at
present
are
in
use
among
mankind
encrease
to
a
sufficient
degree
the
benevolence
of
men
or
the
bounty
of
nature
and
you
render
justice
useless
by
supplying
its
place
with
much
nobler
virtues
and
more
valuable
blessings
the
selfishness
of
men
is
animated
by
the
few
possessions
we
have
in
proportion
to
our
wants
and
it
is
to
restrain
this
selfishness
that
men
have
been
obliged
to
separate
themselves
from
the
community
and
to
distinguish
betwixt
their
own
goods
and
those
of
others
nor
need
we
have
recourse
to
the
fictions
of
poets
to
learn
this
but
beside
the
reason
of
the
thing
may
discover
the
same
truth
by
common
experience
and
observation
it
is
easy
to
remark
that
a
cordial
affection
renders
all
things
common
among
friends
and
that
married
people
in
particular
mutually
lose
their
property
and
are
unacquainted
with
the
mine
and
thine
which
are
so
necessary
and
yet
cause
such
disturbance
in
human
society
the
same
effect
arises
from
any
alteration
in
the
circumstances
of
mankind
as
when
there
is
such
a
plenty
of
any
thing
as
satisfies
all
the
desires
of
men
in
which
case
the
distinction
of
property
is
entirely
lost
and
every
thing
remains
in
common
this
we
may
observe
with
regard
to
air
and
water
though
the
most
valuable
of
all
external
objects
and
may
easily
conclude
that
if
men
were
supplied
with
every
thing
in
the
same
abundance
or
if
every
one
had
the
same
affection
and
tender
regard
for
every
one
as
for
himself
justice
and
injustice
would
be
equally
unknown
among
mankind
here
then
is
a
proposition
which
i
think
may
be
regarded
as
certain
that
it
is
only
from
the
selfishness
and
confined
generosity
of
men
along
with
the
scanty
provision
nature
has
made
for
his
wants
that
justice
derives
its
origin
if
we
look
backward
we
shall
find
that
this
proposition
bestows
an
additional
force
on
some
of
those
observations
which
we
have
already
made
on
this
subject
first
we
may
conclude
from
it
that
a
regard
to
public
interest
or
a
strong
extensive
benevolence
is
not
our
first
and
original
motive
for
the
observation
of
the
rules
of
justice
since
it
is
allowed
that
if
men
were
endowed
with
such
a
benevolence
these
rules
would
never
have
been
dreamt
of
secondly
we
may
conclude
from
the
same
principle
that
the
sense
of
justice
is
not
founded
on
reason
or
on
the
discovery
of
certain
connexions
and
relations
of
ideas
which
are
eternal
immutable
and
universally
obligatory
for
since
it
is
confest
that
such
an
alteration
as
that
in
the
temper
and
circumstances
of
mankind
would
entirely
alter
our
duties
and
obligations
it
is
necessary
upon
the
common
system
that
the
sense
of
virtue
is
derived
from
reason
to
shew
the
change
which
this
must
produce
in
the
relations
and
ideas
but
it
is
evident
that
the
only
cause
why
the
extensive
generosity
of
man
and
the
perfect
abundance
of
every
thing
would
destroy
the
very
idea
of
justice
is
because
they
render
it
useless
and
that
on
the
other
hand
his
confined
benevolence
and
his
necessitous
condition
give
rise
to
that
virtue
only
by
making
it
requisite
to
the
publick
interest
and
to
that
of
every
individual
twas
therefore
a
concern
for
our
own
and
the
publick
interest
which
made
us
establish
the
laws
of
justice
and
nothing
can
be
more
certain
than
that
it
is
not
any
relation
of
ideas
which
gives
us
this
concern
but
our
impressions
and
sentiments
without
which
every
thing
in
nature
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
us
and
can
never
in
the
least
affect
us
the
sense
of
justice
therefore
is
not
founded
on
our
ideas
but
on
our
impressions
thirdly
we
may
farther
confirm
the
foregoing
proposition
that
those
impressions
which
give
rise
to
this
sense
of
justice
are
not
natural
to
the
mind
of
man
but
arise
from
artifice
and
human
conventions
for
since
any
considerable
alteration
of
temper
and
circumstances
destroys
equally
justice
and
injustice
and
since
such
an
alteration
has
an
effect
only
by
changing
our
own
and
the
publick
interest
it
follows
that
the
first
establishment
of
the
rules
of
justice
depends
on
these
different
interests
but
if
men
pursued
the
publick
interest
naturally
and
with
a
hearty
affection
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
restraining
each
other
by
these
rules
and
if
they
pursued
their
own
interest
without
any
precaution
they
would
run
into
every
kind
of
injustice
and
violence
these
rules
therefore
are
artificial
and
seek
their
end
in
an
oblique
and
indirect
manner
nor
is
the
interest
which
gives
rise
to
them
of
a
kind
that
coued
be
pursued
by
the
natural
and
inartificial
passions
of
men
to
make
this
more
evident
consider
that
though
the
rules
of
justice
are
established
merely
by
interest
their
connexion
with
interest
is
somewhat
singular
and
is
different
from
what
may
be
observed
on
other
occasions
a
single
act
of
justice
is
frequently
contrary
to
public
interest
and
were
it
to
stand
alone
without
being
followed
by
other
acts
may
in
itself
be
very
prejudicial
to
society
when
a
man
of
merit
of
a
beneficent
disposition
restores
a
great
fortune
to
a
miser
or
a
seditious
bigot
he
has
acted
justly
and
laudably
but
the
public
is
a
real
sufferer
nor
is
every
single
act
of
justice
considered
apart
more
conducive
to
private
interest
than
to
public
and
it
is
easily
conceived
how
a
man
may
impoverish
himself
by
a
signal
instance
of
integrity
and
have
reason
to
wish
that
with
regard
to
that
single
act
the
laws
of
justice
were
for
a
moment
suspended
in
the
universe
but
however
single
acts
of
justice
may
be
contrary
either
to
public
or
private
interest
it
is
certain
that
the
whole
plan
or
scheme
is
highly
conducive
or
indeed
absolutely
requisite
both
to
the
support
of
society
and
the
of
every
individual
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
good
from
the
property
must
be
stable
and
must
be
fixed
by
general
rules
though
in
one
instance
the
public
be
a
sufferer
this
momentary
ill
is
amply
compensated
by
the
steady
prosecution
of
the
rule
and
by
the
peace
and
order
which
it
establishes
in
society
and
even
every
individual
person
must
find
himself
a
gainer
on
ballancing
the
account
since
without
justice
society
must
immediately
dissolve
and
every
one
must
fall
into
that
savage
and
solitary
condition
which
is
infinitely
worse
than
the
worst
situation
that
can
possibly
be
supposed
in
society
when
therefore
men
have
had
experience
enough
to
observe
that
whatever
may
be
the
consequence
of
any
single
act
of
justice
performed
by
a
single
person
yet
the
whole
system
of
actions
concurred
in
by
the
whole
society
is
infinitely
advantageous
to
the
whole
and
to
every
part
it
is
not
long
before
justice
and
property
take
place
every
member
of
society
is
sen
sible
of
this
interest
every
one
expresses
this
sense
to
his
fellows
along
with
the
resolution
he
has
taken
of
squaring
his
actions
by
it
on
condition
that
others
will
do
the
same
no
more
is
requisite
to
induce
any
one
of
them
to
perform
an
act
of
justice
who
has
the
first
opportunity
this
becomes
an
example
to
others
and
thus
justice
establishes
itself
by
a
kind
of
convention
or
agreement
that
is
by
a
sense
of
interest
supposed
to
be
common
to
all
and
where
every
single
act
is
performed
in
expectation
that
others
are
to
perform
the
like
without
such
a
convention
no
one
would
ever
have
dreamed
that
there
was
such
a
virtue
as
justice
or
have
been
induced
to
conform
his
actions
to
it
taking
any
single
act
my
justice
may
be
pernicious
in
every
respect
and
it
is
only
upon
the
supposition
that
others
are
to
imitate
my
example
that
i
can
be
induced
to
embrace
that
virtue
since
nothing
but
this
combination
can
render
justice
advantageous
or
afford
me
any
motives
to
conform
my
self
to
its
rules
we
come
now
to
the
second
question
we
proposed
viz
why
we
annex
the
idea
of
virtue
to
justice
and
of
vice
to
injustice
this
question
will
not
detain
us
long
after
the
principles
which
we
have
already
established
all
we
can
say
of
it
at
present
will
be
dispatched
in
a
few
words
and
for
farther
satisfaction
the
reader
must
wait
till
we
come
to
the
third
part
of
this
book
the
natural
obligation
to
justice
viz
interest
has
been
fully
explained
but
as
to
the
moral
obligation
or
the
sentiment
of
right
and
wrong
it
will
first
be
requisite
to
examine
the
natural
virtues
before
we
can
give
a
full
and
satisfactory
account
of
it
after
men
have
found
by
experience
that
their
selfishness
and
confined
generosity
acting
at
their
liberty
totally
incapacitate
them
for
society
and
at
the
same
time
have
observed
that
society
is
necessary
to
the
satisfaction
of
those
very
passions
they
are
naturally
induced
to
lay
themselves
under
the
restraint
of
such
rules
as
may
render
their
commerce
more
safe
and
commodious
to
the
imposition
then
and
observance
of
these
rules
both
in
general
and
in
every
particular
instance
they
are
at
first
induced
only
by
a
regard
to
interest
and
this
motive
on
the
first
formation
of
society
is
sufficiently
strong
and
forcible
but
when
society
has
become
numerous
and
has
encreased
to
a
tribe
or
nation
this
interest
is
more
remote
nor
do
men
so
readily
perceive
that
disorder
and
confusion
follow
upon
every
breach
of
these
rules
as
in
a
more
narrow
and
contracted
society
but
though
in
our
own
actions
we
may
frequently
lose
sight
of
that
interest
which
we
have
in
maintaining
order
and
may
follow
a
lesser
and
more
present
interest
we
never
fail
to
observe
the
prejudice
we
receive
either
mediately
or
immediately
from
the
injustice
of
others
as
not
being
in
that
case
either
blinded
by
passion
or
byassed
by
any
contrary
temptation
nay
when
the
injustice
is
so
distant
from
us
as
no
way
to
affect
our
interest
it
still
displeases
us
because
we
consider
it
as
prejudicial
to
human
society
and
pernicious
to
every
one
that
approaches
the
person
guilty
of
it
we
partake
of
their
uneasiness
by
sympathy
and
as
every
thing
which
gives
uneasiness
in
human
actions
upon
the
general
survey
is
called
vice
and
whatever
produces
satisfaction
in
the
same
manner
is
denominated
virtue
this
is
the
reason
why
the
sense
of
moral
good
and
evil
follows
upon
justice
and
injustice
and
though
this
sense
in
the
present
case
be
derived
only
from
contemplating
the
actions
of
others
yet
we
fail
not
to
extend
it
even
to
our
own
actions
the
general
rule
reaches
beyond
those
instances
from
which
it
arose
while
at
the
same
time
we
naturally
sympathize
with
others
in
the
sentiments
they
entertain
of
us
thus
is
the
original
motive
to
the
establishment
of
justice
but
a
sympathy
with
public
interest
is
the
source
of
the
moral
approbation
which
attends
that
virtue
though
this
progress
of
the
sentiments
be
natural
and
even
necessary
it
is
certain
that
it
is
here
forwarded
by
the
artifice
of
politicians
who
in
order
to
govern
men
more
easily
and
preserve
peace
in
human
society
have
endeavoured
to
produce
an
esteem
for
justice
and
an
abhorrence
of
injustice
this
no
doubt
must
have
its
effect
but
nothing
can
be
more
evident
than
that
the
matter
has
been
carryed
too
far
by
certain
writers
on
morals
who
seem
to
have
employed
their
utmost
efforts
to
extirpate
all
sense
of
virtue
from
among
mankind
any
artifice
of
politicians
may
assist
nature
in
the
producing
of
those
sentiments
which
she
suggests
to
us
and
may
even
on
some
occasions
produce
alone
an
approbation
or
esteem
for
any
particular
action
but
it
is
impossible
it
should
be
the
sole
cause
of
the
distinction
we
make
betwixt
vice
and
virtue
for
if
nature
did
not
aid
us
in
this
particular
it
would
be
in
vain
for
politicians
to
talk
of
honourable
or
dishonourable
praiseworthy
or
blameable
these
words
would
be
perfectly
unintelligible
and
would
no
more
have
any
idea
annexed
to
them
than
if
they
were
of
a
tongue
perfectly
unknown
to
us
the
utmost
politicians
can
perform
is
to
extend
the
natural
sentiments
beyond
their
original
bounds
but
still
nature
must
furnish
the
materials
and
give
us
some
notion
of
moral
distinctions
as
publick
praise
and
blame
encrease
our
esteem
for
justice
so
private
education
and
instruction
contribute
to
the
same
effect
for
as
parents
easily
observe
that
a
man
is
the
more
useful
both
to
himself
and
others
the
greater
degree
of
probity
and
honour
he
is
endowed
with
and
that
those
principles
have
greater
force
when
custom
and
education
assist
interest
and
reflection
for
these
reasons
they
are
induced
to
inculcate
on
their
children
from
their
earliest
infancy
the
principles
of
probity
and
teach
them
to
regard
the
observance
of
those
rules
by
which
society
is
maintained
as
worthy
and
honourable
and
their
violation
as
base
and
infamous
by
this
means
the
sentiments
of
honour
may
take
root
in
their
tender
minds
and
acquire
such
firmness
and
solidity
that
they
may
fall
little
short
of
those
principles
which
are
the
most
essential
to
our
natures
and
the
most
deeply
radicated
in
our
internal
constitution
what
farther
contributes
to
encrease
their
solidity
is
the
interest
of
our
reputation
after
the
opinion
that
a
merit
or
demerit
attends
justice
or
injustice
is
once
firmly
established
among
mankind
there
is
nothing
which
touches
us
more
nearly
than
our
reputation
and
nothing
on
which
our
reputation
more
depends
than
our
conduct
with
relation
to
the
property
of
others
for
this
reason
every
one
who
has
any
regard
to
his
character
or
who
intends
to
live
on
good
terms
with
mankind
must
fix
an
inviolable
law
to
himself
never
by
any
temptation
to
be
induced
to
violate
those
principles
which
are
essential
to
a
man
of
probity
and
honour
i
shall
make
only
one
observation
before
i
leave
this
subject
viz
that
though
i
assert
that
in
the
state
of
nature
or
that
imaginary
state
which
preceded
society
there
be
neither
justice
nor
injustice
yet
i
assert
not
that
it
was
allowable
in
such
a
state
to
violate
the
property
of
others
i
only
maintain
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
property
and
consequently
coued
be
no
such
thing
as
justice
or
injustice
i
shall
have
occasion
to
make
a
similar
reflection
with
regard
to
promises
when
i
come
to
treat
of
them
and
i
hope
this
reflection
when
duly
weighed
will
suffice
to
remove
all
odium
from
the
foregoing
opinions
with
regard
to
justice
and
injustice
sect
iii
of
the
rules
which
determine
property
though
the
establishment
of
the
rule
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
be
not
only
useful
but
even
absolutely
necessary
to
human
society
it
can
never
serve
to
any
purpose
while
it
remains
in
such
general
terms
some
method
must
be
shewn
by
which
we
may
distinguish
what
particular
goods
are
to
be
assigned
to
each
particular
person
while
the
rest
of
mankind
are
excluded
from
their
possession
and
enjoyment
our
next
business
then
must
be
to
discover
the
reasons
which
modify
this
general
rule
and
fit
it
to
the
common
use
and
practice
of
the
world
it
is
obvious
that
those
reasons
are
not
derived
from
any
utility
or
advantage
which
either
the
particular
person
or
the
public
may
reap
from
his
enjoyment
of
any
particular
goods
beyond
what
would
result
from
the
possession
of
them
by
any
other
person
twere
better
no
doubt
that
every
one
were
possessed
of
what
is
most
suitable
to
him
and
proper
for
his
use
but
besides
that
this
relation
of
fitness
may
be
common
to
several
at
once
it
is
liable
to
so
many
controversies
and
men
are
so
partial
and
passionate
in
judging
of
these
controversies
that
such
a
loose
and
uncertain
rule
would
be
absolutely
incompatible
with
the
peace
of
human
society
the
convention
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
is
entered
into
in
order
to
cut
off
all
occasions
of
discord
and
contention
and
this
end
would
never
be
attained
were
we
allowed
to
apply
this
rule
differently
in
every
particular
case
according
to
every
particular
utility
which
might
be
discovered
in
such
an
application
justice
in
her
decisions
never
regards
the
fitness
or
unfitness
of
objects
to
particular
persons
but
conducts
herself
by
more
extensive
views
whether
a
man
be
generous
or
a
miser
he
is
equally
well
received
by
her
and
obtains
with
the
same
facility
a
decision
in
his
favours
even
for
what
is
entirely
useless
to
him
it
follows
therefore
that
the
general
rule
that
possession
must
be
stable
is
not
applied
by
particular
judgments
but
by
other
general
rules
which
must
extend
to
the
whole
society
and
be
inflexible
either
by
spite
or
favour
to
illustrate
this
i
propose
the
following
instance
i
first
consider
men
in
their
savage
and
solitary
condition
and
suppose
that
being
sensible
of
the
misery
of
that
state
and
foreseeing
the
advantages
that
would
result
from
society
they
seek
each
other
company
and
make
an
offer
of
mutual
protection
and
assistance
i
also
suppose
that
they
are
endowed
with
such
sagacity
as
immediately
to
perceive
that
the
chief
impediment
to
this
project
of
society
and
partnership
lies
in
the
avidity
and
selfishness
of
their
natural
temper
to
remedy
which
they
enter
into
a
convention
for
the
stability
of
possession
and
for
mutual
restraint
and
forbearance
i
am
sensible
that
this
method
of
proceeding
is
not
altogether
natural
but
besides
that
i
here
only
suppose
those
reflections
to
be
formed
at
once
which
in
fact
arise
insensibly
and
by
degrees
besides
this
i
say
it
is
very
possible
that
several
persons
being
by
different
accidents
separated
from
the
societies
to
which
they
formerly
belonged
may
be
obliged
to
form
a
new
society
among
themselves
in
which
case
they
are
entirely
in
the
situation
it
is
evident
then
that
their
first
difficulty
in
this
situation
after
the
general
convention
for
the
establishment
of
society
and
for
the
constancy
of
possession
is
how
to
separate
their
possessions
and
assign
to
each
his
particular
portion
which
he
must
for
the
future
inalterably
enjoy
this
difficulty
will
not
detain
them
long
but
it
must
immediately
occur
to
them
as
the
most
natural
expedient
that
every
one
continue
to
enjoy
what
he
is
at
present
master
of
and
that
property
or
constant
possession
be
conjoined
to
the
immediate
possession
such
is
the
effect
of
custom
that
it
not
only
reconciles
us
to
any
thing
we
have
long
enjoyed
but
even
gives
us
an
affection
for
it
and
makes
us
prefer
it
to
other
objects
which
may
be
more
valuable
but
are
less
known
to
us
what
has
long
lain
under
our
eye
and
has
often
been
employed
to
our
advantage
that
we
are
always
the
most
unwilling
to
part
with
but
can
easily
live
without
possessions
which
we
never
have
enjoyed
and
are
not
accustomed
to
it
is
evident
therefore
that
men
would
easily
acquiesce
in
this
expedient
that
every
one
continue
to
enjoy
what
he
is
at
present
possessed
of
and
this
is
the
reason
why
they
would
so
naturally
agree
in
preferring
it
footnote
no
questions
in
philosophy
are
more
difficult
than
when
a
number
of
causes
present
themselves
for
the
same
phaenomenon
to
determine
which
is
the
principal
and
predominant
there
seldom
is
any
very
precise
argument
to
fix
our
choice
and
men
must
be
contented
to
be
guided
by
a
kind
of
taste
or
fancy
arising
from
analogy
and
a
comparison
of
familiar
instances
thus
in
the
present
case
there
are
no
doubt
motives
of
public
interest
for
most
of
the
rules
which
determine
property
but
still
i
suspect
that
these
rules
are
principally
fixed
by
the
imagination
or
the
more
frivolous
properties
of
our
thought
and
conception
i
shall
continue
to
explain
these
causes
leaving
it
to
the
reader
choice
whether
he
will
prefer
those
derived
from
publick
utility
or
those
derived
from
the
imagination
we
shall
begin
with
the
right
of
the
present
possessor
it
is
a
quality
which
i
have
already
observed
in
human
nature
that
when
two
objects
appear
in
a
close
relation
to
each
other
the
mind
is
apt
to
ascribe
to
them
any
additional
relation
in
order
to
compleat
the
union
and
this
inclination
is
so
strong
as
often
to
make
us
run
into
errors
such
as
that
of
the
conjunction
of
thought
and
matter
if
we
find
that
they
can
serve
to
that
purpose
many
of
our
impressions
are
incapable
of
place
or
local
position
and
yet
those
very
impressions
we
suppose
to
have
a
local
conjunction
with
the
impressions
of
sight
and
touch
merely
because
they
are
conjoined
by
causation
and
are
already
united
in
the
imagination
since
therefore
we
can
feign
a
new
relation
and
even
an
absurd
one
in
order
to
compleat
any
union
it
will
easily
be
imagined
that
if
there
be
any
relations
which
depend
on
the
mind
it
will
readily
conjoin
them
to
any
preceding
relation
and
unite
by
a
new
bond
such
objects
as
have
already
an
union
in
the
fancy
thus
for
instance
we
never
fail
in
our
arrangement
of
bodies
to
place
those
which
are
resembling
in
contiguity
to
each
other
or
at
least
in
correspondent
points
of
view
because
we
feel
a
satisfaction
in
joining
the
relation
of
contiguity
to
that
of
resemblance
or
the
resemblance
of
situation
to
that
of
qualities
and
this
is
easily
accounted
for
from
the
known
properties
of
human
nature
when
the
mind
is
determined
to
join
certain
objects
but
undetermined
in
its
choice
of
the
particular
objects
it
naturally
turns
its
eye
to
such
as
are
related
together
they
are
already
united
in
the
mind
they
present
themselves
at
the
same
time
to
the
conception
and
instead
of
requiring
any
new
reason
for
their
conjunction
it
would
require
a
very
powerful
reason
to
make
us
this
natural
affinity
this
we
shall
have
occasion
to
explain
more
fully
afterwards
when
we
come
to
treat
of
beauty
in
the
mean
time
we
may
content
ourselves
with
observing
that
the
same
love
of
order
and
uniformity
which
arranges
the
books
in
a
library
and
the
chairs
in
a
parlour
contribute
to
the
formation
of
society
and
to
the
of
mankind
by
modifying
the
general
rule
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
and
as
property
forms
a
relation
betwixt
a
person
and
an
object
it
is
natural
to
found
it
on
some
preceding
relation
and
as
property
is
nothing
but
a
constant
possession
secured
by
the
laws
of
society
it
is
natural
to
add
it
to
the
present
possession
which
is
a
relation
that
resembles
it
for
this
also
has
its
influence
if
it
be
natural
to
conjoin
all
sorts
of
relations
it
is
more
so
to
conjoin
such
relations
as
are
resembling
and
are
related
together
but
we
may
observe
that
though
the
rule
of
the
assignment
of
property
to
the
present
possessor
be
natural
and
by
that
means
useful
yet
its
utility
extends
not
beyond
the
first
formation
of
society
nor
would
any
thing
be
more
pernicious
than
the
constant
observance
of
it
by
which
restitution
would
be
excluded
and
every
injustice
would
be
authorized
and
rewarded
we
must
therefore
seek
for
some
other
circumstance
that
may
give
rise
to
property
after
society
is
once
established
and
of
this
kind
i
find
four
most
considerable
viz
occupation
prescription
accession
and
succession
we
shall
briefly
examine
each
of
these
beginning
with
occupation
the
possession
of
all
external
goods
is
changeable
and
uncertain
which
is
one
of
the
most
considerable
impediments
to
the
establishment
of
society
and
is
the
reason
why
by
universal
agreement
express
or
tacite
men
restrain
themselves
by
what
we
now
call
the
rules
of
justice
and
equity
the
misery
of
the
condition
which
precedes
this
restraint
is
the
cause
why
we
submit
to
that
remedy
as
quickly
as
possible
and
this
affords
us
an
easy
reason
why
we
annex
the
idea
of
property
to
the
first
possession
or
to
occupation
men
are
unwilling
to
leave
property
in
suspense
even
for
the
shortest
time
or
open
the
least
door
to
violence
and
disorder
to
which
we
may
add
that
the
first
possession
always
engages
the
attention
most
and
did
we
neglect
it
there
would
be
no
colour
of
reason
for
assigning
property
to
any
succeeding
possession
footnote
some
philosophers
account
for
the
right
of
occupation
by
saying
that
every
one
has
a
property
in
his
own
labour
and
when
he
joins
that
labour
to
any
thing
it
gives
him
the
property
of
the
whole
but
there
are
several
kinds
of
occupation
where
we
can
not
be
said
to
join
our
labour
to
the
object
we
acquire
as
when
we
possess
a
meadow
by
grazing
our
cattle
upon
it
this
accounts
for
the
matter
by
means
of
accession
which
is
taking
a
needless
circuit
we
can
not
be
said
to
join
our
labour
to
any
thing
but
in
a
figurative
sense
properly
speaking
we
only
make
an
alteration
on
it
by
our
labour
this
forms
a
relation
betwixt
us
and
the
object
and
thence
arises
the
property
according
to
the
preceding
principles
there
remains
nothing
but
to
determine
exactly
what
is
meant
by
possession
and
this
is
not
so
easy
as
may
at
first
sight
be
imagined
we
are
said
to
be
in
possession
of
any
thing
not
only
when
we
immediately
touch
it
but
also
when
we
are
so
situated
with
respect
to
it
as
to
have
it
in
our
power
to
use
it
and
may
move
alter
or
destroy
it
according
to
our
present
pleasure
or
advantage
this
relation
then
is
a
species
of
cause
and
effect
and
as
property
is
nothing
but
a
stable
possession
derived
from
the
rules
of
justice
or
the
conventions
of
men
it
is
to
be
considered
as
the
same
species
of
relation
but
here
we
may
observe
that
as
the
power
of
using
any
object
becomes
more
or
less
certain
according
as
the
interruptions
we
may
meet
with
are
more
or
less
probable
and
as
this
probability
may
increase
by
insensible
degrees
it
is
in
many
cases
impossible
to
determine
when
possession
begins
or
ends
nor
is
there
any
certain
standard
by
which
we
can
decide
such
controversies
a
wild
boar
that
falls
into
our
snares
is
deemed
to
be
in
our
possession
if
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
escape
but
what
do
we
mean
by
impossible
how
do
we
separate
this
impossibility
from
an
improbability
and
how
distinguish
that
exactly
from
a
probability
mark
the
precise
limits
of
the
one
and
the
other
and
shew
the
standard
by
which
we
may
decide
all
disputes
that
may
arise
and
as
we
find
by
experience
frequently
do
arise
upon
this
subject
footnote
if
we
seek
a
solution
of
these
difficulties
in
reason
and
public
interest
we
never
shall
find
satisfaction
and
if
we
look
for
it
in
the
imagination
it
is
evident
that
the
qualities
which
operate
upon
that
faculty
run
so
insensibly
and
gradually
into
each
other
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
them
any
precise
bounds
or
termination
the
difficulties
on
this
head
must
encrease
when
we
consider
that
our
judgment
alters
very
sensibly
according
to
the
subject
and
that
the
same
power
and
proximity
will
be
deemed
possession
in
one
case
which
is
not
esteemed
such
in
another
a
person
who
has
hunted
a
hare
to
the
last
degree
of
weariness
would
look
upon
it
as
an
injustice
for
another
to
rush
in
before
him
and
seize
his
prey
but
the
same
person
advancing
to
pluck
an
apple
that
hangs
within
his
reach
has
no
reason
to
complain
if
another
more
alert
passes
him
and
takes
possession
what
is
the
reason
of
this
difference
but
that
immobility
not
being
natural
to
the
hare
but
the
effect
of
industry
forms
in
that
case
a
strong
relation
with
the
hunter
which
is
wanting
in
the
other
here
then
it
appears
that
a
certain
and
infallible
power
of
enjoyment
without
touch
or
some
other
sensible
relation
often
produces
not
property
and
i
farther
observe
that
a
sensible
relation
without
any
present
power
is
sometimes
sufficient
to
give
a
title
to
any
object
the
sight
of
a
thing
is
seldom
a
considerable
relation
and
is
only
regarded
as
such
when
the
object
is
hidden
or
very
obscure
in
which
case
we
find
that
the
view
alone
conveys
a
property
according
to
that
maxim
that
even
a
whole
continent
belongs
to
the
nation
which
first
discovered
it
it
is
however
remarkable
that
both
in
the
case
of
discovery
and
that
of
possession
the
first
discoverer
and
possessor
must
join
to
the
relation
an
intention
of
rendering
himself
proprietor
otherwise
the
relation
will
not
have
its
effect
and
that
because
the
connexion
in
our
fancy
betwixt
the
property
and
the
relation
is
not
so
great
but
that
it
requires
to
be
helped
by
such
an
intention
from
all
these
circumstances
it
is
easy
to
see
how
perplexed
many
questions
may
become
concerning
the
acquisition
of
property
by
occupation
and
the
least
effort
of
thought
may
present
us
with
instances
which
are
not
susceptible
of
any
reasonable
decision
if
we
prefer
examples
which
are
real
to
such
as
are
feigned
we
may
consider
the
following
one
which
is
to
be
met
with
in
almost
every
writer
that
has
treated
of
the
laws
of
nature
two
grecian
colonies
leaving
their
native
country
in
search
of
new
feats
were
informed
that
a
city
near
them
was
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
to
know
the
truth
of
this
report
they
dispatched
at
once
two
messengers
one
from
each
colony
who
finding
on
their
approach
that
their
information
was
true
begun
a
race
together
with
an
intention
to
take
possession
of
the
city
each
of
them
for
his
countrymen
one
of
these
messengers
finding
that
he
was
not
an
equal
match
for
the
other
launched
his
spear
at
the
gates
of
the
city
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
fix
it
there
before
the
arrival
of
his
companion
this
produced
a
dispute
betwixt
the
two
colonies
which
of
them
was
the
proprietor
of
the
empty
city
and
this
dispute
still
subsists
among
philosophers
for
my
part
i
find
the
dispute
impossible
to
be
decided
and
that
because
the
whole
question
hangs
upon
the
fancy
which
in
this
case
is
not
possessed
of
any
precise
or
determinate
standard
upon
which
it
can
give
sentence
to
make
this
evident
let
us
consider
that
if
these
two
persons
had
been
simply
members
of
the
colonies
and
not
messengers
or
deputies
their
actions
would
not
have
been
of
any
consequence
since
in
that
case
their
relation
to
the
colonies
would
have
been
but
feeble
and
imperfect
add
to
this
that
nothing
determined
them
to
run
to
the
gates
rather
than
the
walls
or
any
other
part
of
the
city
but
that
the
gates
being
the
most
obvious
and
remarkable
part
satisfy
the
fancy
best
in
taking
them
for
the
whole
as
we
find
by
the
poets
who
frequently
draw
their
images
and
metaphors
from
them
besides
we
may
consider
that
the
touch
or
contact
of
the
one
messenger
is
not
properly
possession
no
more
than
the
piercing
the
gates
with
a
spear
but
only
forms
a
relation
and
there
is
a
relation
in
the
other
case
equally
obvious
tho
not
perhaps
of
equal
force
which
of
these
relations
then
conveys
a
right
and
property
or
whether
any
of
them
be
sufficient
for
that
effect
i
leave
to
the
decision
of
such
as
are
wiser
than
myself
but
such
disputes
may
not
only
arise
concerning
the
real
existence
of
property
and
possession
but
also
concerning
their
extent
and
these
disputes
are
often
susceptible
of
no
decision
or
can
be
decided
by
no
other
faculty
than
the
imagination
a
person
who
lands
on
the
shore
of
a
small
island
that
is
desart
and
uncultivated
is
deemed
its
possessor
from
the
very
first
moment
and
acquires
the
property
of
the
whole
because
the
object
is
there
bounded
and
circumscribed
in
the
fancy
and
at
the
same
time
is
proportioned
to
the
new
possessor
the
same
person
landing
on
a
desart
island
as
large
as
great
britain
extends
his
property
no
farther
than
his
immediate
possession
though
a
numerous
colony
are
esteemed
the
proprietors
of
the
whole
from
the
instant
of
their
debarkment
but
it
often
happens
that
the
title
of
first
possession
becomes
obscure
through
time
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
determine
many
controversies
which
may
arise
concerning
it
in
that
case
long
possession
or
prescription
naturally
takes
place
and
gives
a
person
a
sufficient
property
in
any
thing
he
enjoys
the
nature
of
human
society
admits
not
of
any
great
accuracy
nor
can
we
always
remount
to
the
first
origin
of
things
in
order
to
determine
their
present
condition
any
considerable
space
of
time
sets
objects
at
such
a
distance
that
they
seem
in
a
manner
to
lose
their
reality
and
have
as
little
influence
on
the
mind
as
if
they
never
had
been
in
being
a
man
title
that
is
clear
and
certain
at
present
will
seem
obscure
and
doubtful
fifty
years
hence
even
though
the
facts
on
which
it
is
founded
should
be
proved
with
the
greatest
evidence
and
certainty
the
same
facts
have
not
the
same
influence
after
so
long
an
interval
of
time
and
this
may
be
received
as
a
convincing
argument
for
our
preceding
doctrine
with
regard
to
property
and
justice
possession
during
a
long
tract
of
time
conveys
a
title
to
any
object
but
as
it
is
certain
that
however
every
thing
be
produced
in
time
there
is
nothing
real
that
is
produced
by
time
it
follows
that
property
being
produced
by
time
is
not
any
thing
real
in
the
objects
but
is
the
of
the
sentiments
on
which
alone
time
is
found
to
have
any
influence
footnote
present
possession
is
plainly
a
relation
betwixt
a
person
and
an
object
but
is
not
sufficient
to
the
relation
of
first
possession
unless
the
former
be
long
and
uninterrupted
in
which
case
the
relation
is
encreased
on
the
side
of
the
present
possession
by
the
extent
of
time
and
dlminished
on
that
of
first
possession
by
the
distance
this
change
in
the
relation
produces
a
consequent
change
in
the
property
we
acquire
the
property
of
objects
by
accession
when
they
are
connected
in
an
intimate
manner
with
objects
that
are
already
our
property
and
at
the
same
time
are
inferior
to
them
thus
the
fruits
of
our
garden
the
offspring
of
our
cattle
and
the
work
of
our
slaves
are
all
of
them
esteemed
our
property
even
before
possession
where
objects
are
connected
together
in
the
imagination
they
are
apt
to
be
put
on
the
same
footing
and
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
the
same
qualities
we
readily
pass
from
one
to
the
other
and
make
no
difference
in
our
judgments
concerning
them
especially
if
the
latter
be
inferior
to
the
former
footnote
this
source
of
property
can
never
be
explained
but
from
the
imaginations
and
one
may
affirm
that
the
causes
are
here
unmixed
we
shall
proceed
to
explain
them
more
particularly
and
illustrate
them
by
examples
from
common
life
and
experience
it
has
been
observed
above
that
the
mind
has
a
natural
propensity
to
join
relations
especially
resembling
ones
and
finds
a
hind
of
fitness
and
uniformity
in
such
an
union
from
this
propensity
are
derived
these
laws
of
nature
that
upon
the
first
formation
of
society
property
always
follows
the
present
possession
and
afterwards
that
it
arises
from
first
or
from
long
possession
now
we
may
easily
observe
that
relation
is
not
confined
merely
to
one
degree
but
that
from
an
object
that
is
related
to
us
we
acquire
a
relation
to
every
other
object
which
is
related
to
it
and
so
on
till
the
thought
loses
the
chain
by
too
long
a
progress
however
the
relation
may
weaken
by
each
remove
it
is
not
immediately
destroyed
but
frequently
connects
two
objects
by
means
of
an
intermediate
one
which
is
related
to
both
and
this
principle
is
of
such
force
as
to
give
rise
to
the
right
of
accession
and
causes
us
to
acquire
the
property
not
only
of
such
objects
as
we
are
immediately
possessed
of
but
also
of
such
as
are
closely
connected
with
them
suppose
a
german
a
frenchman
and
a
spaniard
to
come
into
a
room
where
there
are
placed
upon
the
table
three
bottles
of
wine
rhenish
burgundy
and
port
and
suppose
they
shoued
fall
a
quarrelling
about
the
division
of
them
a
person
who
was
chosen
for
umpire
would
naturally
to
shew
his
impartiality
give
every
one
the
product
of
his
own
country
and
this
from
a
principle
which
in
some
measure
is
the
source
of
those
laws
of
nature
that
ascribe
property
to
occupation
prescription
and
accession
in
all
these
cases
and
particularly
that
of
accession
there
is
first
a
natural
union
betwixt
the
idea
of
the
person
and
that
of
the
object
and
afterwards
a
new
and
moral
union
produced
by
that
right
or
property
which
we
ascribe
to
the
person
but
here
there
occurs
a
difficulty
which
merits
our
attention
and
may
afford
us
an
opportunity
of
putting
to
tryal
that
singular
method
of
reasoning
which
has
been
employed
on
the
present
subject
i
have
already
observed
that
the
imagination
passes
with
greater
facility
from
little
to
great
than
from
great
to
littie
and
that
the
transition
of
ideas
is
always
easier
and
smoother
in
the
former
case
than
in
the
latter
now
as
the
right
of
accession
arises
from
the
easy
transition
of
ideas
by
which
related
objects
are
connected
together
it
shoued
naturally
be
imagined
that
the
right
of
accession
must
encrease
in
strength
in
proportion
as
the
transition
of
ideas
is
performed
with
greater
facility
it
may
therefore
be
thought
that
when
we
have
acquired
the
property
of
any
small
object
we
shall
readily
consider
any
great
object
related
to
it
as
an
accession
and
as
belonging
to
the
proprietor
of
the
small
one
since
the
transition
is
in
that
case
very
easy
from
the
small
object
to
the
great
one
and
shoued
connect
them
together
in
the
closest
manner
but
in
fact
the
case
is
always
found
to
be
otherwise
the
empire
of
great
britain
seems
to
draw
along
with
it
the
dominion
of
the
orkneys
the
hebrides
the
isle
of
man
and
the
isle
of
wight
but
the
authority
over
those
lesser
islands
does
not
naturally
imply
any
title
to
great
britain
in
short
a
small
object
naturally
follows
a
great
one
as
its
accession
but
a
great
one
is
never
supposed
to
belong
to
the
proprietor
of
a
small
one
related
to
it
merely
on
account
of
that
property
and
relation
yet
in
this
latter
case
the
transition
of
ideas
is
smoother
from
the
proprietor
to
the
small
object
which
is
his
property
and
from
the
small
object
to
the
great
one
than
in
the
former
case
from
the
proprietor
to
the
great
object
and
from
the
great
one
to
the
small
it
may
therefore
be
thought
that
these
phaenomena
are
objections
to
the
foregoing
hypothesis
that
the
ascribing
of
property
to
accession
is
nothing
but
an
affect
of
the
relations
of
ideas
and
of
the
smooth
transition
of
the
imagination
it
will
be
easy
to
solve
this
objection
if
we
consider
the
agility
and
unsteadiness
of
the
imagination
with
the
different
views
in
which
it
is
continually
placing
its
objects
when
we
attribute
to
a
person
a
property
in
two
objects
we
do
not
always
pass
from
the
person
to
one
object
and
from
that
to
the
other
related
to
it
the
objects
being
here
to
be
considered
as
the
property
of
the
person
we
are
apt
to
join
them
together
and
place
them
in
the
same
light
suppose
therefore
a
great
and
a
small
object
to
be
related
together
if
a
person
be
strongly
related
to
the
great
object
he
will
likewise
be
strongly
related
to
both
the
objects
considered
together
because
he
is
related
to
the
most
considerable
part
on
the
contrary
if
he
be
only
related
to
the
small
object
he
will
not
be
strongly
related
to
both
considered
together
since
his
relation
lies
only
with
the
most
trivial
part
which
is
not
apt
to
strike
us
in
any
great
degree
when
we
consider
the
whole
and
this
is
the
reason
why
small
objects
become
accessions
to
great
ones
and
not
great
to
small
it
is
the
general
opinion
of
philosophers
and
civilians
that
the
sea
is
incapable
of
becoming
the
property
of
any
nation
and
that
because
it
is
impossible
to
take
possession
of
it
or
form
any
such
distinct
relation
with
it
as
may
be
the
foundation
of
property
where
this
reason
ceases
property
immediately
takes
place
thus
the
most
strenuous
advocates
for
the
liberty
of
the
seas
universally
allow
that
friths
and
hays
naturally
belong
as
an
accession
to
the
proprietors
of
the
surrounding
continent
these
have
properly
no
more
bond
or
union
with
the
land
than
the
pacific
ocean
would
have
but
having
an
union
in
the
fancy
and
being
at
the
same
time
inferior
they
are
of
course
regarded
as
an
accession
the
property
of
rivers
by
the
laws
of
most
nations
and
by
the
natural
turn
of
our
thought
is
attributed
to
the
proprietors
of
their
banks
excepting
such
vast
rivers
as
the
rhine
or
the
danube
which
seem
too
large
to
the
imagination
to
follow
as
an
accession
the
property
of
the
neighbouring
fields
yet
even
these
rivers
are
considered
as
the
property
of
that
nation
thro
whose
dominions
they
run
the
idea
of
a
nation
being
of
a
suitable
bulk
to
correspond
with
them
and
bear
them
such
a
relation
in
the
fancy
the
accessions
which
are
made
to
lands
bordering
upon
rivers
follow
the
land
say
the
civilians
provided
it
be
made
by
what
they
call
alluvion
that
is
insensibly
and
imperceptibly
which
are
circumstances
that
mightily
assist
the
imagination
in
the
conjunction
where
there
is
any
considerable
portion
torn
at
once
from
one
bank
and
joined
to
another
it
becomes
not
his
property
whose
land
it
falls
on
till
it
unite
with
the
land
and
till
the
trees
or
plants
have
spread
their
roots
into
both
before
that
the
imagination
does
not
sufficiently
join
them
there
are
other
cases
which
somewhat
resemble
this
of
accession
but
which
at
the
bottom
are
considerably
different
and
merit
our
attention
of
this
kind
is
the
conjunction
of
the
properties
of
different
persons
after
such
a
manner
as
not
to
admit
of
separation
the
question
is
to
whom
the
united
mass
must
belong
where
this
conjunction
is
of
such
a
nature
as
to
admit
of
division
but
not
of
separation
the
decision
is
natural
and
easy
the
whole
mass
must
be
supposed
to
be
common
betwixt
the
proprietors
of
the
several
parts
and
afterwards
must
be
divided
according
to
the
proportions
of
these
parts
but
here
i
can
not
forbear
taking
notice
of
a
remarkable
subtilty
of
the
roman
law
in
distinguishing
betwixt
confusion
and
commixtion
confusion
is
an
union
of
two
bodies
such
as
different
liquors
where
the
parts
become
entirely
undistinguishable
commixtion
is
the
blending
of
two
bodies
such
as
two
bushels
of
corn
where
the
parts
remain
separate
in
an
obvious
and
visible
manner
as
in
the
latter
case
the
imagination
discovers
not
so
entire
an
union
as
in
the
former
but
is
able
to
trace
and
preserve
a
distinct
idea
of
the
property
of
each
this
is
the
reason
why
the
civil
law
tho
it
established
an
entire
community
in
the
case
of
confusion
and
after
that
a
proportional
division
yet
in
the
case
of
commixtion
supposes
each
of
the
proprietors
to
maintain
a
distinct
right
however
necessity
may
at
last
force
them
to
submit
to
the
same
division

that

with

if

was

on

part
of

of
you
it
is
common
property
inasmuch
as
the
individual
items
the
single
grains
which
were
the
peculiar
property
of
either
of
you
were
combined
with
your
joint
consent
if
however
the
mixture
was
accidental
or
if
titius
mixed
it
without
your
consent
it
does
not
appear
that
it
is
common
property
inasmuch
as
the
several
components
retain
their
original
identity
rather
in
circumstances
of
this
sort
the
grain
does
not
become

property
any
more
than
a

of
cattle
is
regarded
as

property
if

beasts
should
have
become
mixed
up
with
yours
however
if
all
of
the
aforesaid
corn
is
kept
by
either
of
you
this
gives
rise
to
a
suit
to
determine
the
ownership
of
property
in
respect
of
the
amount
of
corn
belonging
to
each
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge
to
determine
which
is
the
corn
belonging
to
either
party
where
the
properties
of
two
persons
are
united
after
such
a
manner
as
neither
to
admit
of
division
nor
separation
as
when
one
builds
a
house
on
another
ground
in
that
case
the
whole
must
belong
to
one
of
the
proprietors
and
here
i
assert
that
it
naturally
is
conceived
to
belong
to
the
proprietor
of
the
most
considerable
part
for
however
the
compound
object
may
have
a
relation
to
two
different
persons
and
carry
our
view
at
once
to
both
of
them
yet
as
the
most
considerable
part
principally
engages
our
attention
and
by
the
strict
union
draws
the
inferior
along
it
for
this
reason
the
whole
bears
a
relation
to
the
proprietor
of
that
part
and
is
regarded
as
his
property
the
only
difficulty
is
what
we
shall
be
pleased
to
call
the
most
considerable
part
and
most
attractive
to
the
imagination
this
quality
depends
on
several
different
circumstances
which
have
little
connexion
with
each
other
one
part
of
a
compound
object
may
become
more
considerable
than
another
either
because
it
is
more
constant
and
durable
because
it
is
of
greater
value
because
it
is
more
obvious
and
remarkable
because
it
is
of
greater
extent
or
because
its
existence
is
more
separate
and
independent
it
will
be
easy
to
conceive
that
as
these
circumstances
may
be
conjoined
and
opposed
in
all
the
different
ways
and
according
to
all
the
different
degrees
which
can
be
imagined
there
will
result
many
cases
where
the
reasons
on
both
sides
are
so
equally
balanced
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
give
any
satisfactory
decision
here
then
is
the
proper
business
of
municipal
laws
to
fix
what
the
principles
of
human
nature
have
left
undetermined
the
superficies
yields
to
the
soil
says
the
civil
law
the
writing
to
the
paper
the
canvas
to
the
picture
these
decisions
do
not
well
agree
together
and
are
a
proof
of
the
contrariety
of
those
principles
from
which
they
are
derived
but
of
all
the
questions
of
this
kind
the
most
curious
is
that
which
for
so
many
ages
divided
the
disciples
of
proculus
and
sabinus
suppose
a
person
shoued
make
a
cup
from
the
metal
of
another
or
a
ship
from
his
wood
and
suppose
the
proprietor
of
the
metal
or
wood
shoued
demand
his
goods
the
question
is
whether
he
acquires
a
title
to
the
cup
or
ship
sabinus
maintained
the
affirmative
and
asserted
that
the
substance
or
matter
is
the
foundation
of
all
the
qualities
that
it
is
incorruptible
and
immortal
and
therefore
superior
to
the
form
which
is
casual
and
dependent
on
the
other
hand
proculus
observed
that
the
form
is
the
most
obvious
and
remarkable
part
and
that
from
it
bodies
are
denominated
of
this
or
that
particular
species
to
which
he
might
have
added
that
the
matter
or
substance
is
in
most
bodies
so
fluctuating
and
uncertain
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
trace
it
in
all
its
changes
for
my
part
i
know
not
from
what
principles
such
a
controversy
can
be
certainly
determined
i
shall
therefore
content
my
self
with
observing
that
the
decision
of
trebonian
seems
to
me
pretty
ingenious
that
the
cup
belongs
to
the
proprietor
of
the
metal
because
it
can
be
brought
back
to
its
first
form
but
that
the
ship
belongs
to
the
author
of
its
form
for
a
contrary
reason
but
however
ingenious
this
reason
may
seem
it
plainly
depends
upon
the
fancy
which
by
the
possibility
of
such
a
reduction
finds
a
closer
connexion
and
relation
betwixt
a
cup
and
the
proprietor
of
its
metal
than
betwixt
a
ship
and
the
proprietor
of
its
wood
where
the
substance
is
more
fixed
and
unalterable
the
right
of
succession
is
a
very
natural
one
from
the
presumed
consent
of
the
parent
or
near
relation
and
from
the
general
interest
of
mankind
which
requires
that
men
possessions
should
pass
to
those
who
are
dearest
to
them
in
order
to
render
them
more
industrious
and
frugal
perhaps
these
causes
are
seconded
by
the
influence
of
relation
or
the
association
of
ideas
by
which
we
are
naturally
directed
to
consider
the
son
after
the
parent
decease
and
ascribe
to
him
a
title
to
his
father
possessions
those
goods
must
become
the
property
of
some
body
but
of
whom
is
the
question
here
it
is
evident
the
persons
children
naturally
present
themselves
to
the
mind
and
being
already
connected
to
those
possessions
by
means
of
their
deceased
parent
we
are
apt
to
connect
them
still
farther
by
the
relation
of
property
of
this
there
are
many
parallel
instances
footnote
in
examining
the
different
titles
to
authority
in
government
we
shall
meet
with
many
reasons
to
convince
us
that
the
right
of
succession
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
imagination
mean
while
i
shall
rest
contented
with
observing
one
example
which
belongs
to
the
present
subject
suppose
that
a
person
die
without
children
and
that
a
dispute
arises
among
his
relations
concerning
his
inheritance
it
is
evident
that
if
his
riches
be
partly
from
his
father
partly
from
his
mother
the
most
natural
way
of
determining
such
a
dispute
is
to
divide
his
possessions
and
assign
each
part
to
the
family
from
whence
it
is
deriv
now
as
the
person
is
suppos
to
have
been
once
the
full
and
entire
proprietor
of
those
goods
i
ask
what
is
it
makes
us
find
a
certain
equity
and
natural
reason
in
this
partition
except
it
be
the
imagination
his
affection
to
these
families
does
not
depend
upon
his
possessions
for
which
reason
his
consent
can
never
be
presum
precisely
for
such
a
partition
and
as
to
the
public
interest
it
seems
not
to
be
in
the
least
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
sect
iv
of
the
transference
of
property
by
consent
however
useful
or
even
necessary
the
stability
of
possession
may
be
to
human
society
it
is
attended
with
very
considerable
inconveniences
the
relation
of
fitness
or
suitableness
ought
never
to
enter
into
consideration
in
distributing
the
properties
of
mankind
but
we
must
govern
ourselves
by
rules
which
are
more
general
in
their
application
and
more
free
from
doubt
and
uncertainty
of
this
kind
is
present
possession
upon
the
first
establishment
of
society
and
afterwards
occupation
prescription
accession
and
succession
as
these
depend
very
much
on
chance
they
must
frequently
prove
contradictory
both
to
men
wants
and
desires
and
persons
and
possessions
must
often
be
very
ill
adjusted
this
is
a
grand
inconvenience
which
calls
for
a
remedy
to
apply
one
directly
and
allow
every
man
to
seize
by
violence
what
he
judges
to
be
fit
for
him
would
destroy
society
and
therefore
the
rules
of
justice
seek
some
medium
betwixt
a
rigid
stability
and
this
changeable
and
uncertain
adjustment
but
there
is
no
medium
better
than
that
obvious
one
that
possession
and
property
should
always
be
stable
except
when
the
proprietor
consents
to
bestow
them
on
some
other
person
this
rule
can
have
no
ill
consequence
in
occasioning
wars
and
dissentions
since
the
proprietor
consent
who
alone
is
concerned
is
taken
along
in
the
alienation
and
it
may
serve
to
many
good
purposes
in
adjusting
property
to
persons
different
parts
of
the
earth
produce
different
commodities
and
not
only
so
but
different
men
both
are
by
nature
fitted
for
different
employments
and
attain
to
greater
perfection
in
any
one
when
they
confine
themselves
to
it
alone
all
this
requires
a
mutual
exchange
and
commerce
for
which
reason
the
translation
of
property
by
consent
is
founded
on
a
law
of
nature
as
well
as
its
stability
without
such
a
consent
so
far
is
determined
by
a
plain
utility
and
interest
but
perhaps
it
is
from
more
trivial
reasons
that
delivery
or
a
sensible
transference
of
the
object
is
commonly
required
by
civil
laws
and
also
by
the
laws
of
nature
according
to
most
authors
as
a
requisite
circumstance
in
the
translation
of
property
the
property
of
an
object
when
taken
for
something
real
without
any
reference
to
morality
or
the
sentiments
of
the
mind
is
a
quality
perfectly
insensible
and
even
inconceivable
nor
can
we
form
any
distinct
notion
either
of
its
stability
or
translation
this
imperfection
of
our
ideas
is
less
sensibly
felt
with
regard
to
its
stability
as
it
engages
less
our
attention
and
is
easily
past
over
by
the
mind
without
any
scrupulous
examination
but
as
the
translation
of
property
from
one
person
to
another
is
a
more
remarkable
event
the
defect
of
our
ideas
becomes
more
sensible
on
that
occasion
and
obliges
us
to
turn
ourselves
on
every
side
in
search
of
some
remedy
now
as
nothing
more
enlivens
any
idea
than
a
present
impression
and
a
relation
betwixt
that
impression
and
the
idea
it
is
natural
for
us
to
seek
some
false
light
from
this
quarter
in
order
to
aid
the
imagination
in
conceiving
the
transference
of
property
we
take
the
sensible
object
and
actually
transfer
its
possession
to
the
person
on
whom
we
would
bestow
the
property
the
supposed
resemblance
of
the
actions
and
the
presence
of
this
sensible
delivery
deceive
the
mind
and
make
it
fancy
that
it
conceives
the
mysterious
transition
of
the
property
and
that
this
explication
of
the
matter
is
just
appears
hence
that
men
have
invented
a
symbolical
delivery
to
satisfy
the
fancy
where
the
real
one
is
impracticable
thus
the
giving
the
keys
of
a
granary
is
understood
to
be
the
delivery
of
the
corn
contained
in
it
the
giving
of
stone
and
earth
represents
the
delivery
of
a
mannor
this
is
a
kind
of
superstitious
practice
in
civil
laws
and
in
the
laws
of
nature
resembling
the
roman
catholic
superstitions
in
religion
as
the
roman
catholics
represent
the
inconceivable
mysteries
of
the
christian
religion
and
render
them
more
present
to
the
mind
by
a
taper
or
habit
or
grimace
which
is
supposed
to
resemble
them
so
lawyers
and
moralists
have
run
into
like
inventions
for
the
same
reason
and
have
endeavoured
by
those
means
to
satisfy
themselves
concerning
the
transference
of
property
by
consent
sect
v
of
the
obligation
of
promises
that
the
rule
of
morality
which
enjoins
the
performance
of
promises
is
not
natural
will
sufficiently
appear
from
these
two
propositions
which
i
proceed
to
prove
viz
that
a
promise
would
not
be
intelligible
before
human
conventions
had
established
it
and
that
even
if
it
were
intelligible
it
would
not
be
attended
with
any
moral
obligation
i
say
first
that
a
promise
is
not
intelligible
naturally
nor
antecedent
to
human
conventions
and
that
a
man
unacquainted
with
society
could
never
enter
into
any
engagements
with
another
even
though
they
could
perceive
each
other
thoughts
by
intuition
if
promises
be
natural
and
intelligible
there
must
be
some
act
of
the
mind
attending
these
words
i
promise
and
on
this
act
of
the
mind
must
the
obligation
depend
let
us
therefore
run
over
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
and
see
which
of
them
is
exerted
in
our
promises
the
act
of
the
mind
exprest
by
a
promise
is
not
a
resolution
to
perform
any
thing
for
that
alone
never
imposes
any
obligation
nor
is
it
a
desire
of
such
a
performance
for
we
may
bind
ourselves
without
such
a
desire
or
even
with
an
aversion
declared
and
avowed
neither
is
it
the
willing
of
that
action
which
we
promise
to
perform
for
a
promise
always
regards
some
future
time
and
the
will
has
an
influence
only
on
present
actions
it
follows
therefore
that
since
the
act
of
the
mind
which
enters
into
a
promise
and
produces
its
obligation
is
neither
the
resolving
desiring
nor
willing
any
particular
performance
it
must
necessarily
be
the
willing
of
that
obligation
which
arises
from
the
promise
nor
is
this
only
a
conclusion
of
philosophy
but
is
entirely
conformable
to
our
common
ways
of
thinking
and
of
expressing
ourselves
when
we
say
that
we
are
bound
by
our
own
consent
and
that
the
obligation
arises
from
our
mere
will
and
pleasure
the
only
question
then
is
whether
there
be
not
a
manifest
absurdity
in
supposing
this
act
of
the
mind
and
such
an
absurdity
as
no
man
coued
fall
into
whose
ideas
are
not
confounded
with
prejudice
and
the
fallacious
use
of
language
all
morality
depends
upon
our
sentiments
and
when
any
action
or
quality
of
the
mind
pleases
us
after
a
certain
manner
we
say
it
is
virtuous
and
when
the
neglect
or
nonperformance
of
it
displeases
us
after
a
like
manner
we
say
that
we
lie
under
an
obligation
to
perform
it
a
change
of
the
obligation
supposes
a
change
of
the
sentiment
and
a
creation
of
a
new
obligation
supposes
some
new
sentiment
to
arise
but
it
is
certain
we
can
naturally
no
more
change
our
own
sentiments
than
the
motions
of
the
heavens
nor
by
a
single
act
of
our
will
that
is
by
a
promise
render
any
action
agreeable
or
disagreeable
moral
or
immoral
which
without
that
act
would
have
produced
contrary
impressions
or
have
been
endowed
with
different
qualities
it
would
be
absurd
therefore
to
will
any
new
obligation
that
is
any
new
sentiment
of
pain
or
pleasure
nor
is
it
possible
that
men
coued
naturally
fall
into
so
gross
an
absurdity
a
promise
therefore
is
naturally
something
altogether
unintelligible
nor
is
there
any
act
of
the
mind
belonging
to
it
footnote
were
morality
discoverable
by
reason
and
not
by
sentiment
it
would
be
still
more
evident
that
promises
cou
make
no
alteration
upon
it
morality
is
suppos
to
consist
in
relation
every
new
imposition
of
morality
therefore
must
arise
from
some
new
relation
of
objects
and
consequently
the
will
coud
not
produce
immediately
any
change
in
morals
but
cou
have
that
effect
only
by
producing
a
change
upon
the
objects
but
as
the
moral
obligation
of
a
promise
is
the
pure
effect
of
the
will
without
the
least
change
in
any
part
of
the
universe
it
follows
that
promises
have
no
natural
obligation
shou
it
be
said
that
this
act
of
the
will
being
in
effect
a
new
object
produces
new
relations
and
new
duties
i
answer
that
this
is
a
pure
sophism
which
may
be
detected
by
a
very
moderate
share
of
accuracy
and
exactness
to
will
a
new
obligation
is
to
will
a
new
relation
of
objects
and
therefore
if
this
new
relation
of
objects
were
form
by
the
volition
itself
we
should
in
effect
will
the
volition
which
is
plainly
absurd
and
impossible
the
will
has
here
no
object
to
which
it
cou
tend
but
must
return
upon
itself
in
infinitum
the
new
obligation
depends
upon
new
relations
the
new
relations
depend
upon
a
new
volition
the
new
volition
has
for
object
a
new
obligation
and
consequently
new
relations
and
consequently
a
new
volition
which
volition
again
has
in
view
a
new
obligation
relation
and
volition
without
any
termination
it
is
impossible
therefore
we
cou
ever
will
a
new
obligation
and
consequently
it
is
impossible
the
will
cou
ever
accompany
a
promise
or
produce
a
new
obligation
of
morality
but
secondly
if
there
was
any
act
of
the
mind
belonging
to
it
it
could
not
naturally
produce
any
obligation
this
appears
evidently
from
the
foregoing
reasoning
a
promise
creates
a
new
obligation
a
new
obligation
supposes
new
sentiments
to
arise
the
will
never
creates
new
sentiments
there
could
not
naturally
therefore
arise
any
obligation
from
a
promise
even
supposing
the
mind
could
fall
into
the
absurdity
of
willing
that
obligation
the
same
truth
may
be
proved
still
more
evidently
by
that
reasoning
which
proved
justice
in
general
to
be
an
artificial
virtue
no
action
can
be
required
of
us
as
our
duty
unless
there
be
implanted
in
human
nature
some
actuating
passion
or
motive
capable
of
producing
the
action
this
motive
can
not
be
the
sense
of
duty
a
sense
of
duty
supposes
an
antecedent
obligation
and
where
an
action
is
not
required
by
any
natural
passion
it
can
not
be
required
by
any
natural
obligation
since
it
may
be
omitted
without
proving
any
defect
or
imperfection
in
the
mind
and
temper
and
consequently
without
any
vice
now
it
is
evident
we
have
no
motive
leading
us
to
the
performance
of
promises
distinct
from
a
sense
of
duty
if
we
thought
that
promises
had
no
moral
obligation
we
never
should
feel
any
inclination
to
observe
them
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
natural
virtues
though
there
was
no
obligation
to
relieve
the
miserable
our
humanity
would
lead
us
to
it
and
when
we
omit
that
duty
the
immorality
of
the
omission
arises
from
its
being
a
proof
that
we
want
the
natural
sentiments
of
humanity
a
father
knows
it
to
be
his
duty
to
take
care
of
his
children
but
he
has
also
a
natural
inclination
to
it
and
if
no
human
creature
had
that
indination
no
one
coued
lie
under
any
such
obligation
but
as
there
is
naturally
no
inclination
to
observe
promises
distinct
from
a
sense
of
their
obligation
it
follows
that
fidelity
is
no
natural
virtue
and
that
promises
have
no
force
antecedent
to
human
conventions
if
any
one
dissent
from
this
he
must
give
a
regular
proof
of
these
two
propositions
viz
that
there
is
a
peculiar
act
of
the
mind
annext
to
promises
and
that
consequent
to
this
act
of
the
mind
there
arises
an
inclination
to
perform
distinct
from
a
sense
of
duty
i
presume
that
it
is
impossible
to
prove
either
of
these
two
points
and
therefore
i
venture
to
conclude
that
promises
are
human
inventions
founded
on
the
necessities
and
interests
of
society
in
order
to
discover
these
necessities
and
interests
we
must
consider
the
same
qualities
of
human
nature
which
we
have
already
found
to
give
rise
to
the
preceding
laws
of
society
men
being
naturally
selfish
or
endowed
only
with
a
confined
generosity
they
are
not
easily
induced
to
perform
any
action
for
the
interest
of
strangers
except
with
a
view
to
some
reciprocal
advantage
which
they
had
no
hope
of
obtaining
but
by
such
a
performance
now
as
it
frequently
happens
that
these
mutual
performances
can
not
be
finished
at
the
same
instant
it
is
necessary
that
one
party
be
contented
to
remain
in
uncertainty
and
depend
upon
the
gratitude
of
the
other
for
a
return
of
kindness
but
so
much
corruption
is
there
among
men
that
generally
speaking
this
becomes
but
a
slender
security
and
as
the
benefactor
is
here
supposed
to
bestow
his
favours
with
a
view
to
this
both
takes
off
from
the
obligation
and
sets
an
example
to
selfishness
which
is
the
true
mother
of
ingratitude
were
we
therefore
to
follow
the
natural
course
of
our
passions
and
inclinations
we
should
perform
but
few
actions
for
the
advantage
of
others
from
distinterested
views
because
we
are
naturally
very
limited
in
our
kindness
and
affection
and
we
should
perform
as
few
of
that
kind
out
of
a
regard
to
interest
because
we
can
not
depend
upon
their
gratitude
here
then
is
the
mutual
commerce
of
good
offices
in
a
manner
lost
among
mankind
and
every
one
reduced
to
his
own
skill
and
industry
for
his
and
subsistence
the
invention
of
the
law
of
nature
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
has
already
rendered
men
tolerable
to
each
other
that
of
the
transference
of
property
and
possession
by
consent
has
begun
to
render
them
mutually
advantageous
but
still
these
laws
of
nature
however
strictly
observed
are
not
sufficient
to
render
them
so
serviceable
to
each
other
as
by
nature
they
are
fitted
to
become
though
possession
be
stable
men
may
often
reap
but
small
advantage
from
it
while
they
are
possessed
of
a
greater
quantity
of
any
species
of
goods
than
they
have
occasion
for
and
at
the
same
time
suffer
by
the
want
of
others
the
transference
of
property
which
is
the
proper
remedy
for
this
inconvenience
can
not
remedy
it
entirely
because
it
can
only
take
place
with
regard
to
such
objects
as
are
present
and
individual
but
not
to
such
as
are
absent
or
general
one
can
not
transfer
the
property
of
a
particular
house
twenty
leagues
distant
because
the
consent
can
not
be
attended
with
delivery
which
is
a
requisite
circumstance
neither
can
one
transfer
the
property
of
ten
bushels
of
corn
or
five
hogsheads
of
wine
by
the
mere
expression
and
consent
because
these
are
only
general
terms
and
have
no
direct
relation
to
any
particular
heap
of
corn
or
barrels
of
wine
besides
the
commerce
of
mankind
is
not
confined
to
the
barter
of
commodities
but
may
extend
to
services
and
actions
which
we
may
exchange
to
our
mutual
interest
and
advantage
your
corn
is
ripe
mine
will
be
so
tomorrow
it
is
profitable
for
us
both
that
i
should
labour
with
you
and
that
you
should
aid
me
i
have
no
kindness
for
you
and
know
you
have
as
little
for
me
i
will
not
therefore
take
any
pains
upon
your
account
and
should
i
labour
with
you
upon
my
own
account
in
expectation
of
a
return
i
know
i
should
be
disappointed
and
that
i
should
in
vain
depend
upon
your
gratitude
here
then
i
leave
you
to
labour
alone
you
treat
me
in
the
same
manner
the
seasons
change
and
both
of
us
lose
our
harvests
for
want
of
mutual
confidence
and
security
all
this
is
the
effect
of
the
natural
and
inherent
principles
and
passions
of
human
nature
and
as
these
passions
and
principles
are
inalterable
it
may
be
thought
that
our
conduct
which
depends
on
them
must
be
so
too
and
that
it
would
be
in
vain
either
for
moralists
or
politicians
to
tamper
with
us
or
attempt
to
change
the
usual
course
of
our
actions
with
a
view
to
public
interest
and
indeed
did
the
success
of
their
designs
depend
upon
their
success
in
correcting
the
selfishness
and
ingratitude
of
men
they
would
never
make
any
progress
unless
aided
by
omnipotence
which
is
alone
able
to
the
human
mind
and
change
its
character
in
such
fundamental
articles
all
they
can
pretend
to
is
to
give
a
new
direction
to
those
natural
passions
and
teach
us
that
we
can
better
satisfy
our
appetites
in
an
oblique
and
artificial
manner
than
by
their
headlong
and
impetuous
motion
hence
i
learn
to
do
a
service
to
another
without
bearing
him
any
real
kindness
because
i
forsee
that
he
will
return
my
service
in
expectation
of
another
of
the
same
kind
and
in
order
to
maintain
the
same
correspondence
of
good
offices
with
me
or
with
others
and
accordingly
after
i
have
served
him
and
he
is
in
possession
of
the
advantage
arising
from
my
action
he
is
induced
to
perform
his
part
as
foreseeing
the
consequences
of
his
refusal
but
though
this
commerce
of
man
begins
to
take
place
and
to
predominate
in
society
it
does
not
entirely
abolish
the
more
generous
and
noble
intercourse
of
friendship
and
good
offices
i
may
still
do
services
to
such
persons
as
i
love
and
am
more
particularly
acquainted
with
without
any
prospect
of
advantage
and
they
may
make
me
a
return
in
the
same
manner
without
any
view
but
that
of
recompensing
my
past
services
in
order
therefore
to
distinguish
those
two
different
sorts
of
commerce
the
interested
and
the
disinterested
there
is
a
certain
form
of
words
invented
for
the
former
by
which
we
bind
ourselves
to
the
performance
of
any
action
this
form
of
words
constitutes
what
we
call
a
promise
which
is
the
sanction
of
the
interested
commerce
of
mankind
when
a
man
says
he
promises
any
thing
he
in
effect
expresses
a
resolution
of
performing
it
and
along
with
that
by
making
use
of
this
form
of
words
subjects
himself
to
the
penalty
of
never
being
trusted
again
in
case
of
failure
a
resolution
is
the
natural
act
of
the
mind
which
promises
express
but
were
there
no
more
than
a
resolution
in
the
case
promises
would
only
declare
our
former
motives
and
would
not
create
any
new
motive
or
obligation
they
are
the
conventions
of
men
which
create
a
new
motive
when
experience
has
taught
us
that
human
affairs
would
be
conducted
much
more
for
mutual
advantage
were
there
certain
symbols
or
signs
instituted
by
which
we
might
give
each
other
security
of
our
conduct
in
any
particular
incident
after
these
signs
are
instituted
whoever
uses
them
is
immediately
bound
by
his
interest
to
execute
his
engagements
and
must
never
expect
to
be
trusted
any
more
if
he
refuse
to
perform
what
he
promised
nor
is
that
knowledge
which
is
requisite
to
make
mankind
sensible
of
this
interest
in
the
institution
and
observance
of
promises
to
be
esteemed
superior
to
the
capacity
of
human
nature
however
savage
and
uncultivated
there
needs
but
a
very
little
practice
of
the
world
to
make
us
perceive
all
these
consequences
and
advantages
the
shortest
experience
of
society
discovers
them
to
every
mortal
and
when
each
individual
perceives
the
same
sense
of
interest
in
all
his
fellows
he
immediately
performs
his
part
of
any
contract
as
being
assured
that
they
will
not
be
wanting
in
theirs
all
of
them
by
concert
enter
into
a
scheme
of
actions
calculated
for
common
benefit
and
agree
to
be
true
to
their
word
nor
is
there
any
thing
requisite
to
form
this
concert
or
convention
but
that
every
one
have
a
sense
of
interest
in
the
faithful
fulfilling
of
engagements
and
express
that
sense
to
other
members
of
the
society
this
immediately
causes
that
interest
to
operate
upon
them
and
interest
is
the
first
obligation
to
the
performance
of
promises
afterwards
a
sentiment
of
morals
concurs
with
interest
and
becomes
a
new
obligation
upon
mankind
this
sentiment
of
morality
in
the
performance
of
promises
arises
from
the
same
principles
as
that
in
the
abstinence
from
the
property
of
others
public
interest
education
and
the
artifices
of
politicians
have
the
same
effect
in
both
cases
the
difficulties
that
occur
to
us
in
supposing
a
moral
obligation
to
attend
promises
we
either
surmount
or
elude
for
instance
the
expression
of
a
resolution
is
not
commonly
supposed
to
be
obligatory
and
we
can
not
readily
conceive
how
the
making
use
of
a
certain
form
of
words
should
be
able
to
cause
any
material
difference
here
therefore
we
feign
a
new
act
of
the
mind
which
we
call
the
willing
an
obligation
and
on
this
we
suppose
the
morality
to
depend
but
we
have
proved
already
that
there
is
no
such
act
of
the
mind
and
consequently
that
promises
impose
no
natural
obligation
to
confirm
this
we
may
subjoin
some
other
reflections
concerning
that
will
which
is
supposed
to
enter
into
a
promise
and
to
cause
its
obligation
it
is
evident
that
the
will
alone
is
never
supposed
to
cause
the
obligation
but
must
be
expressed
by
words
or
signs
in
order
to
impose
a
tye
upon
any
man
the
expression
being
once
brought
in
as
subservient
to
the
will
soon
becomes
the
principal
part
of
the
promise
nor
will
a
man
be
less
bound
by
his
word
though
he
secretly
give
a
different
direction
to
his
intention
and
himself
both
from
a
resolution
and
from
willing
an
obligation
but
though
the
expression
makes
on
most
occasions
the
whole
of
the
promise
yet
it
does
not
always
so
and
one
who
should
make
use
of
any
expression
of
which
he
knows
not
the
meaning
and
which
he
uses
without
any
intention
of
binding
himself
would
not
certainly
be
bound
by
it
nay
though
he
knows
its
meaning
yet
if
he
uses
it
in
jest
only
and
with
such
signs
as
shew
evidently
he
has
no
serious
intention
of
binding
himself
he
would
not
lie
under
any
obligation
of
performance
but
it
is
necessary
that
the
words
be
a
perfect
expression
of
the
will
without
any
contrary
signs
nay
even
this
we
must
not
carry
so
far
as
to
imagine
that
one
whom
by
our
quickness
of
understanding
we
conjecture
from
certain
signs
to
have
an
intention
of
deceiving
us
is
not
bound
by
his
expression
or
verbal
promise
if
we
accept
of
it
but
must
limit
this
conclusion
to
those
cases
where
the
signs
are
of
a
different
kind
from
those
of
deceit
all
these
contradictions
are
easily
accounted
for
if
the
obligation
of
promises
be
merely
a
human
invention
for
the
convenience
of
society
but
will
never
be
explained
if
it
be
something
real
and
natural
arising
from
any
action
of
the
mind
or
body
i
shall
farther
observe
that
since
every
new
promise
imposes
a
new
obligation
of
morality
on
the
person
who
promises
and
since
this
new
obligation
arises
from
his
will
it
is
one
of
the
most
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
operations
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
and
may
even
be
compared
to
transubstantiation
or
holy
orders
i
mean
so
far
as
holy
orders
are
suppos
to
produce
the
indelible
character
in
other
respects
they
are
only
a
legal
qualification
where
a
certain
form
of
words
along
with
a
certain
intention
changes
entirely
the
nature
of
an
external
object
and
even
of
a
human
nature
but
though
these
mysteries
be
so
far
alike
it
is
very
remarkable
that
they
differ
widely
in
other
particulars
and
that
this
difference
may
be
regarded
as
a
strong
proof
of
the
difference
of
their
origins
as
the
obligation
of
promises
is
an
invention
for
the
interest
of
society
it
is
warped
into
as
many
different
forms
as
that
interest
requires
and
even
runs
into
direct
contradictions
rather
than
lose
sight
of
its
object
but
as
those
other
monstrous
doctines
are
mere
priestly
inventions
and
have
no
public
interest
in
view
they
are
less
disturbed
in
their
progress
by
new
obstacles
and
it
must
be
owned
that
after
the
first
absurdity
they
follow
more
directly
the
current
of
reason
and
good
sense
theologians
clearly
perceived
that
the
external
form
of
words
being
mere
sound
require
an
intention
to
make
them
have
any
efficacy
and
that
this
intention
being
once
considered
as
a
requisite
circumstance
its
absence
must
equally
prevent
the
effect
whether
avowed
or
concealed
whether
sincere
or
deceitful
accordingly
they
have
commonly
determined
that
the
intention
of
the
priest
makes
the
sacrament
and
that
when
he
secretly
withdraws
his
intention
he
is
highly
criminal
in
himself
but
still
destroys
the
baptism
or
communion
or
holy
orders
the
terrible
consequences
of
this
doctrine
were
not
able
to
hinder
its
taking
place
as
the
inconvenience
of
a
similar
doctrine
with
regard
to
promises
have
prevented
that
doctrine
from
establishing
itself
men
are
always
more
concerned
about
the
present
life
than
the
future
and
are
apt
to
think
the
smallest
evil
which
regards
the
former
more
important
than
the
greatest
which
regards
the
latter
we
may
draw
the
same
conclusion
concerning
the
origin
of
promises
from
the
force
which
is
supposed
to
invalidate
all
contracts
and
to
free
us
from
their
obligation
such
a
principle
is
a
proof
that
promises
have
no
natural
obligation
and
are
mere
artificial
contrivances
for
the
convenience
and
advantage
of
society
if
we
consider
aright
of
the
matter
force
is
not
essentially
different
from
any
other
motive
of
hope
or
fear
which
may
induce
us
to
engage
our
word
and
lay
ourselves
under
any
obligation
a
man
dangerously
wounded
who
promises
a
competent
sum
to
a
surgeon
to
cure
him
would
certainly
be
bound
to
performance
though
the
case
be
not
so
much
different
from
that
of
one
who
promises
a
sum
to
a
robber
as
to
produce
so
great
a
difference
in
our
sentiments
of
morality
if
these
sentiments
were
not
built
entirely
on
public
interest
and
convenience
sect
vi
some
farther
reflections
concerning
justice
and
injustice
we
have
now
run
over
the
three
fundamental
laws
of
nature
that
of
the
stability
of
possession
of
its
transference
by
consent
and
of
the
performance
of
promises
it
is
on
the
strict
t
observance
of
those
three
laws
that
the
peace
and
security
of
human
society
entirely
depend
nor
is
there
any
possibility
of
establishing
a
good
correspondence
among
men
where
these
are
neglected
society
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
of
men
and
these
are
as
necessary
to
the
support
of
society
whatever
restraint
they
may
impose
on
the
passions
of
men
they
are
the
real
offspring
of
those
passions
and
are
only
a
more
artful
and
more
refined
way
of
satisfying
them
nothing
is
more
vigilant
and
inventive
than
our
passions
and
nothing
is
more
obvious
than
the
convention
for
the
observance
of
these
rules
nature
has
therefore
trusted
this
affair
entirely
to
the
conduct
of
men
and
has
not
placed
in
the
mind
any
peculiar
original
principles
to
determine
us
to
a
set
of
actions
into
which
the
other
principles
of
our
frame
and
constitution
were
sufficient
to
lead
us
and
to
convince
us
the
more
fully
of
this
truth
we
may
here
stop
a
moment
and
from
a
review
of
the
preceding
reasonings
may
draw
some
new
arguments
to
prove
that
those
laws
however
necessary
are
entirely
artificial
and
of
human
invention
and
consequently
that
justice
is
an
artificial
and
not
a
natural
virtue
the
first
argument
i
shall
make
use
of
is
derived
from
the
vulgar
definition
of
justice
justice
is
commonly
defined
to
be
a
constant
and
perpetual
will
of
giving
every
one
his
due
in
this
definition
it
is
supposed
that
there
are
such
things
as
right
and
property
independent
of
justice
and
antecedent
to
it
and
that
they
would
have
subsisted
though
men
had
never
dreamt
of
practising
such
a
virtue
i
have
already
observed
in
a
cursory
manner
the
fallacy
of
this
opinion
and
shall
here
continue
to
open
up
a
little
more
distinctly
my
sentiments
on
that
subject
i
shall
begin
with
observing
that
this
quality
which
we
shall
call
property
is
like
many
of
the
imaginary
qualities
of
the
peripatetic
philosophy
and
vanishes
upon
a
more
accurate
inspection
into
the
subject
when
considered
from
our
moral
sentiments
it
is
evident
property
does
not
consist
in
any
of
the
sensible
qualities
of
the
object
for
these
may
continue
invariably
the
same
while
the
property
changes
property
therefore
must
consist
in
some
relation
of
the
object
but
it
is
not
in
its
relation
with
regard
to
other
external
and
inanimate
objects
for
these
may
also
continue
invariably
the
same
while
the
property
changes
this
quality
therefore
consists
in
the
relations
of
objects
to
intelligent
and
rational
beings
but
it
is
not
the
external
and
corporeal
relation
which
forms
the
essence
of
property
for
that
relation
may
be
the
same
betwixt
inanimate
objects
or
with
regard
to
brute
creatures
though
in
those
cases
it
forms
no
property
it
is
therefore
in
some
internal
relation
that
the
property
consists
that
is
in
some
influence
which
the
external
relations
of
the
object
have
on
the
mind
and
actions
thus
the
external
relation
which
we
call
occupation
or
first
possession
is
not
of
itself
imagined
to
be
the
property
of
the
object
but
only
to
cause
its
property
now
it
is
evident
this
external
relation
causes
nothing
in
external
objects
and
has
only
an
influence
on
the
mind
by
giving
us
a
sense
of
duty
in
abstaining
from
that
object
and
in
restoring
it
to
the
first
possessor
these
actions
are
properly
what
we
call
justice
and
consequently
it
is
on
that
virtue
that
the
nature
of
property
depends
and
not
the
virtue
on
the
property
if
any
one
therefore
would
assert
that
justice
is
a
natural
virtue
and
injustice
a
natural
vice
he
must
assert
that
abstracting
from
the
nations
of
property
and
right
and
obligation
a
certain
conduct
and
train
of
actions
in
certain
external
relations
of
objects
has
naturally
a
moral
beauty
or
deformity
and
causes
an
original
pleasure
or
uneasiness
thus
the
restoring
a
man
goods
to
him
is
considered
as
virtuous
not
because
nature
has
annexed
a
certain
sentiment
of
pleasure
to
such
a
conduct
with
regard
to
the
property
of
others
but
because
she
has
annexed
that
sentiment
to
such
a
conduct
with
regard
to
those
external
objects
of
which
others
have
had
the
first
or
long
possession
or
which
they
have
received
by
the
consent
of
those
who
have
had
first
or
long
possession
if
nature
has
given
us
no
such
sentiment
there
is
not
naturally
nor
antecedent
to
human
conventions
any
such
thing
as
property
now
though
it
seems
sufficiently
evident
in
this
dry
and
accurate
consideration
of
the
present
subject
that
nature
has
annexed
no
pleasure
or
sentiment
of
approbation
to
such
a
conduct
yet
that
i
may
leave
as
little
room
for
doubt
as
possible
i
shall
subjoin
a
few
more
arguments
to
confirm
my
opinion
first
if
nature
had
given
us
a
pleasure
of
this
kind
it
would
have
been
as
evident
and
discernible
as
on
every
other
occasion
nor
should
we
have
found
any
difficulty
to
perceive
that
the
consideration
of
such
actions
in
such
a
situation
gives
a
certain
pleasure
and
sentiment
of
approbation
we
should
not
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
notions
of
property
in
the
definition
of
justice
and
at
the
same
time
make
use
of
the
notions
of
justice
in
the
definition
of
property
this
deceitful
method
of
reasoning
is
a
plain
proof
that
there
are
contained
in
the
subject
some
obscurities
and
difficulties
which
we
are
not
able
to
surmount
and
which
we
desire
to
evade
by
this
artifice
secondly
those
rules
by
which
properties
rights
and
obligations
are
determined
have
in
them
no
marks
of
a
natural
origin
but
many
of
artifice
and
contrivance
they
are
too
numerous
to
have
proceeded
from
nature
they
are
changeable
by
human
laws
and
have
all
of
them
a
direct
and
evident
tendency
to
public
good
and
the
support
of
civil
society
this
last
circumstance
is
remarkable
upon
two
accounts
first
because
though
the
cause
of
the
establishment
of
these
laws
had
been
a
regard
for
the
public
good
as
much
as
the
public
good
is
their
natural
tendency
they
would
still
have
been
artificial
as
being
purposely
contrived
and
directed
to
a
certain
end
secondly
because
if
men
had
been
endowed
with
such
a
strong
regard
for
public
good
they
would
never
have
restrained
themselves
by
these
rules
so
that
the
laws
of
justice
arise
from
natural
principles
in
a
manner
still
more
oblique
and
artificial
it
is
which
is
their
real
origin
and
as
the
of
one
person
is
naturally
contrary
to
that
of
another
these
several
interested
passions
are
obliged
to
adjust
themselves
after
such
a
manner
as
to
concur
in
some
system
of
conduct
and
behaviour
this
system
therefore
comprehending
the
interest
of
each
individual
is
of
course
advantageous
to
the
public
though
it
be
not
intended
for
that
purpose
by
die
inventors
in
the
second
place
we
may
observe
that
all
kinds
of
vice
and
virtue
run
insensibly
into
each
other
and
may
approach
by
such
imperceptible
degrees
as
will
make
it
very
difficult
if
not
absolutely
impossible
to
determine
when
the
one
ends
and
the
other
begins
and
from
this
observation
we
may
derive
a
new
argument
for
the
foregoing
principle
for
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
regard
to
all
kinds
of
vice
and
virtue
it
is
certain
that
rights
and
obligations
and
property
admit
of
no
such
insensible
gradation
but
that
a
man
either
has
a
full
and
perfect
property
or
none
at
all
and
is
either
entirely
obliged
to
perform
any
action
or
lies
under
no
manner
of
obligation
however
civil
laws
may
talk
of
a
perfect
dominion
and
of
an
imperfect
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
this
arises
from
a
fiction
which
has
no
foundation
in
reason
and
can
never
enter
into
our
notions
of
natural
justice
and
equity
a
man
that
hires
a
horse
though
but
for
a
day
has
as
full
a
right
to
make
use
of
it
for
that
time
as
he
whom
we
call
its
proprietor
has
to
make
use
of
it
any
other
day
and
it
was
evident
that
however
the
use
may
be
bounded
in
time
or
degree
the
right
itself
is
not
susceptible
of
any
such
gradation
but
is
absolute
and
entire
so
far
as
it
extends
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
this
right
both
arises
and
perishes
in
an
instant
and
that
a
man
entirely
acquires
the
property
of
any
object
by
occupation
or
the
consent
of
the
proprietor
and
loses
it
by
his
own
consent
without
any
of
that
insensible
gradation
which
is
remarkable
in
other
qualities
and
relations
since
therefore
this
is
die
case
with
regard
to
property
and
rights
and
obligations
i
ask
how
it
stands
with
regard
to
justice
and
injustice
after
whatever
manner
you
answer
this
question
you
run
into
inextricable
difficulties
if
you
reply
that
justice
and
injustice
admit
of
degree
and
run
insensibly
into
each
other
you
expressly
contradict
the
foregoing
position
that
obligation
and
property
are
not
susceptible
of
such
a
gradation
these
depend
entirely
upon
justice
and
injustice
and
follow
them
in
all
their
variations
where
the
justice
is
entire
the
property
is
also
entire
where
the
justice
is
imperfect
the
property
must
also
be
imperfect
and
vice
versa
if
the
property
admit
of
no
such
variations
they
must
also
be
incompatible
with
justice
if
you
assent
therefore
to
this
last
proposition
and
assert
that
justice
and
injustice
are
not
susceptible
of
degrees
you
in
effect
assert
that
they
are
not
naturally
either
vicious
or
virtuous
since
vice
and
virtue
moral
good
and
evil
and
indeed
all
natural
qualities
run
insensibly
into
each
other
and
are
on
many
occasions
undistinguishable
and
here
it
may
be
worth
while
to
observe
that
though
abstract
reasoning
and
the
general
maxims
of
philosophy
and
law
establish
this
position
that
property
and
right
and
obligation
admit
not
of
degrees
yet
in
our
common
and
negligent
way
of
thinking
we
find
great
difficulty
to
entertain
that
opinion
and
do
even
secretly
embrace
the
contrary
principle
an
object
must
either
be
in
the
possession
of
one
person
or
another
an
action
must
either
be
performed
or
not
the
necessity
there
is
of
choosing
one
side
in
these
dilemmas
and
the
impossibility
there
often
is
of
finding
any
just
medium
oblige
us
when
we
reflect
on
the
matter
to
acknowledge
that
all
property
and
obligations
are
entire
but
on
the
other
hand
when
we
consider
the
origin
of
property
and
obligation
and
find
that
they
depend
on
public
utility
and
sometimes
on
the
propensities
of
the
imagination
which
are
seldom
entire
on
any
side
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
imagine
that
these
moral
relations
admit
of
an
insensible
gradation
hence
it
is
that
in
references
where
the
consent
of
the
parties
leave
the
referees
entire
masters
of
the
subject
they
commonly
discover
so
much
equity
and
justice
on
both
sides
as
induces
them
to
strike
a
medium
and
divide
the
difference
betwixt
the
parties
civil
judges
who
have
not
this
liberty
but
are
obliged
to
give
a
decisive
sentence
on
some
one
side
are
often
at
a
loss
how
to
determine
and
are
necessitated
to
proceed
on
the
most
frivolous
reasons
in
the
world
half
rights
and
obligations
which
seem
so
natural
in
common
life
are
perfect
absurdities
in
their
tribunal
for
which
reason
they
are
often
obliged
to
take
half
arguments
for
whole
ones
in
order
to
terminate
the
affair
one
way
or
other
the
third
argument
of
this
kind
i
shall
make
use
of
may
be
explained
thus
if
we
consider
the
ordinary
course
of
human
actions
we
shall
find
that
the
mind
restrains
not
itself
by
any
general
and
universal
rules
but
acts
on
most
occasions
as
it
is
determined
by
its
present
motives
and
inclination
as
each
action
is
a
particular
individual
event
it
must
proceed
from
particular
principles
and
from
our
immediate
situation
within
ourselves
and
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
if
on
some
occasions
we
extend
our
motives
beyond
those
very
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
them
and
form
something
like
general
rules
for
our
conduct
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
these
rules
are
not
perfectly
inflexible
but
allow
of
many
exceptions
since
therefore
this
is
the
ordinary
course
of
human
actions
we
may
conclude
that
the
laws
of
justice
being
universal
and
perfectly
inflexible
can
never
be
derived
from
nature
nor
be
the
immediate
offspring
of
any
natural
motive
or
inclination
no
action
can
be
either
morally
good
or
evil
unless
there
be
some
natural
passion
or
motive
to
impel
us
to
it
or
deter
us
from
it
and
it
is
evident
that
die
morality
must
be
susceptible
of
all
the
same
variations
which
are
natural
to
the
passion
here
are
two
persons
who
dispute
for
an
estate
of
whom
one
is
rich
a
fool
and
a
batchelor
the
other
poor
a
man
of
sense
and
has
a
numerous
family
the
first
is
my
enemy
the
second
my
friend
whether
i
be
actuated
in
this
affair
by
a
view
to
public
or
private
interest
by
friendship
or
enmity
i
must
be
induced
to
do
my
utmost
to
procure
the
estate
to
the
latter
nor
would
any
consideration
of
the
right
and
property
of
the
persons
be
able
to
restrain
me
were
i
actuated
only
by
natural
motives
without
any
combination
or
convention
with
others
for
as
all
property
depends
on
morality
and
as
all
morality
depends
on
the
ordinary
course
of
our
passions
and
actions
and
as
these
again
are
only
directed
by
particular
motives
it
is
evident
such
a
partial
conduct
must
be
suitable
to
the
strictest
morality
and
coued
never
be
a
violation
of
property
were
men
therefore
to
take
the
liberty
of
acting
with
regard
to
the
laws
of
society
as
they
do
in
every
other
affair
they
would
conduct
themselves
on
most
occasions
by
particular
judgments
and
would
take
into
consideration
the
characters
and
circumstances
of
the
persons
as
well
as
the
general
nature
of
the
question
but
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
this
would
produce
an
infinite
confusion
in
human
society
and
that
the
avidity
and
partiality
of
men
would
quickly
bring
disorder
into
the
world
if
not
restrained
by
some
general
and
inflexible
principles
twas
therefore
with
a
view
to
this
inconvenience
that
men
have
established
those
principles
and
have
agreed
to
restrain
themselves
by
general
rules
which
are
unchangeable
by
spite
and
favour
and
by
particular
views
of
private
or
public
interest
these
rules
then
are
artificially
invented
for
a
certain
purpose
and
are
contrary
to
the
common
principles
of
human
nature
which
accommodate
themselves
to
circumstances
and
have
no
stated
invariable
method
of
operation
nor
do
i
perceive
how
i
can
easily
be
mistaken
in
this
matter
i
see
evidently
that
when
any
man
imposes
on
himself
general
inflexible
rules
in
his
conduct
with
others
he
considers
certain
objects
as
their
property
which
he
supposes
to
be
sacred
and
inviolable
but
no
proposition
can
be
more
evident
than
that
property
is
perfectly
unintelligible
without
first
supposing
justice
and
injustice
and
that
these
virtues
and
vices
are
as
unintelligible
unless
we
have
motives
independent
of
the
morality
to
impel
us
to
just
actions
and
deter
us
from
unjust
ones
let
those
motives
therefore
be
what
they
will
they
must
accommodate
themselves
to
circumstances
and
must
admit
of
all
the
variations
which
human
affairs
in
their
incessant
revolutions
are
susceptible
of
they
are
consequently
a
very
improper
foundation
for
such
rigid
inflexible
rules
as
the
laws
of
nature
and
it
is
evident
these
laws
can
only
be
derived
from
human
conventions
when
men
have
perceived
the
disorders
that
result
from
following
their
natural
and
variable
principles
upon
the
whole
then
we
are
to
consider
this
distinction
betwixt
justice
and
injustice
as
having
two
different
foundations
viz
that
of
interest
when
men
observe
that
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
society
without
restraining
themselves
by
certain
rules
and
that
of
morality
when
this
interest
is
once
observed
and
men
receive
a
pleasure
from
the
view
of
such
actions
as
tend
to
the
peace
of
society
and
an
uneasiness
from
such
as
are
contrary
to
it
it
is
the
voluntary
convention
and
artifice
of
men
which
makes
the
first
interest
take
place
and
therefore
those
laws
of
justice
are
so
far
to
be
considered
as
artifrial
after
that
interest
is
once
established
and
acknowledged
the
sense
of
morality
in
the
observance
of
these
rules
follows
naturally
and
of
itself
though
it
is
certain
that
it
is
also
augmented
by
a
new
artifice
and
that
the
public
instructions
of
politicians
and
the
private
education
of
parents
contribute
to
the
giving
us
a
sense
of
honour
and
duty
in
the
strict
regulation
of
our
actions
with
regard
to
the
properties
of
others
sect
vii
of
the
origin
of
government
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
men
are
in
a
great
measure
governed
by
interest
and
that
even
when
they
extend
their
concern
beyond
themselves
it
is
not
to
any
great
distance
nor
is
it
usual
for
them
in
common
life
to
look
farther
than
their
nearest
friends
and
acquaintance
it
is
no
less
certain
that
it
is
impossible
for
men
to
consult
their
interest
in
so
effectual
a
manner
as
by
an
universal
and
inflexible
observance
of
the
rules
of
justice
by
which
alone
they
can
preserve
society
and
keep
themselves
from
falling
into
that
wretched
and
savage
condition
which
is
commonly
represented
as
the
state
of
nature
and
as
this
interest
which
all
men
have
in
the
upholding
of
society
and
the
observation
of
the
rules
of
justice
is
great
so
is
it
palpable
and
evident
even
to
the
most
rude
and
uncultivated
of
human
race
and
it
is
almost
impossible
for
any
one
who
has
had
experience
of
society
to
be
mistaken
in
this
particular
since
therefore
men
are
so
sincerely
attached
to
their
interest
and
their
interest
is
so
much
concerned
in
the
observance
of
justice
and
this
interest
is
so
certain
and
avowed
it
may
be
asked
how
any
disorder
can
ever
arise
in
society
and
what
principle
there
is
in
human
nature
so
powerful
as
to
overcome
so
strong
a
passion
or
so
violent
as
to
obscure
so
clear
a
knowledge
it
has
been
observed
in
treating
of
the
passions
that
men
are
mightily
governed
by
the
imagination
and
proportion
their
affections
more
to
the
light
under
which
any
object
appears
to
them
than
to
its
real
and
intrinsic
value
what
strikes
upon
them
with
a
strong
and
lively
idea
commonly
prevails
above
what
lies
in
a
more
obscure
light
and
it
must
be
a
great
superiority
of
value
that
is
able
to
compensate
this
advantage
now
as
every
thing
that
is
contiguous
to
us
either
in
space
or
time
strikes
upon
us
with
such
an
idea
it
has
a
proportional
effect
on
the
will
and
passions
and
commonly
operates
with
more
force
than
any
object
that
lies
in
a
more
distant
and
obscure
light
though
we
may
be
fully
convinced
that
the
latter
object
excels
the
former
we
are
not
able
to
regulate
our
actions
by
this
judgment
but
yield
to
the
sollicitations
of
our
passions
which
always
plead
in
favour
of
whatever
is
near
and
contiguous
this
is
the
reason
why
men
so
often
act
in
contradiction
to
their
known
interest
and
in
particular
why
they
prefer
any
trivial
advantage
that
is
present
to
the
maintenance
of
order
in
society
which
so
much
depends
on
the
observance
of
justice
the
consequences
of
every
breach
of
equity
seem
to
lie
very
remote
and
are
not
able
to
any
immediate
advantage
that
may
be
reaped
from
it
they
are
however
never
the
less
real
for
being
remote
and
as
all
men
are
in
some
degree
subject
to
the
same
weakness
it
necessarily
happens
that
the
violations
of
equity
must
become
very
frequent
in
society
and
the
commerce
of
men
by
that
means
be
rendered
very
dangerous
and
uncertain
you
have
the
same
propension
that
i
have
in
favour
of
what
is
contiguous
above
what
is
remote
you
are
therefore
naturally
carried
to
commit
acts
of
injustice
as
well
as
me
your
example
both
pushes
me
forward
in
this
way
by
imitation
and
also
affords
me
a
new
reason
for
any
breach
of
equity
by
shewing
me
that
i
should
be
the
cully
of
my
integrity
if
i
alone
should
impose
on
myself
a
severe
restraint
amidst
the
licentiousness
of
others
this
quality
therefore
of
human
nature
not
only
is
very
dangerous
to
society
but
also
seems
on
a
cursory
view
to
be
incapable
of
any
remedy
the
remedy
can
only
come
from
the
consent
of
men
and
if
men
be
incapable
of
themselves
to
prefer
remote
to
contiguous
they
will
never
consent
to
any
thing
which
would
oblige
them
to
such
a
choice
and
contradict
in
so
sensible
a
manner
their
natural
principles
and
propensities
whoever
chuses
the
means
chuses
also
the
end
and
if
it
be
impossible
for
us
to
prefer
what
is
remote
it
is
equally
impossible
for
us
to
submit
to
any
necessity
which
would
oblige
us
to
such
a
method
of
acting
but
here
it
is
observable
that
this
infirmity
of
human
nature
becomes
a
remedy
to
itself
and
that
we
provide
against
our
negligence
about
remote
objects
merely
because
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
that
negligence
when
we
consider
any
objects
at
a
distance
all
their
minute
distinctions
vanish
and
we
always
give
the
preference
to
whatever
is
in
itself
preferable
without
considering
its
situation
and
circumstances
this
gives
rise
to
what
in
an
improper
sense
we
call
reason
which
is
a
principle
that
is
often
contradictory
to
those
propensities
that
display
themselves
upon
the
approach
of
the
object
in
reflecting
on
any
action
which
i
am
to
perform
a
hence
i
always
resolve
to
prefer
the
greater
good
whether
at
that
time
it
will
be
more
contiguous
or
remote
nor
does
any
difference
in
that
particular
make
a
difference
in
my
present
intentions
and
resolutions
my
distance
from
the
final
determination
makes
all
those
minute
differences
vanish
nor
am
i
affected
by
any
thing
but
the
general
and
more
discernible
qualities
of
good
and
evil
but
on
my
nearer
approach
those
circumstances
which
i
at
first
begin
to
appear
and
have
an
influence
on
my
conduct
and
affections
a
new
inclination
to
the
present
good
springs
up
and
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
adhere
inflexibly
to
my
first
purpose
and
resolution
this
natural
infirmity
i
may
very
much
regret
and
i
may
endeavour
by
all
possible
means
to
free
my
self
from
it
i
may
have
recourse
to
study
and
reflection
within
myself
to
the
advice
of
friends
to
frequent
meditation
and
repeated
resolution
and
having
experienced
how
ineffectual
all
these
are
i
may
embrace
with
pleasure
any
other
expedient
by
which
i
may
impose
a
restraint
upon
myself
and
guard
against
this
weakness
the
only
difficulty
therefore
is
to
find
out
this
expedient
by
which
men
cure
their
natural
weakness
and
lay
themselves
under
the
necessity
of
observing
the
laws
of
justice
and
equity
notwithstanding
their
violent
propension
to
prefer
contiguous
to
remote
it
is
evident
such
a
remedy
can
never
be
effectual
without
correcting
this
propensity
and
as
it
is
impossible
to
change
or
correct
any
thing
material
in
our
nature
the
utmost
we
can
do
is
to
change
our
circumstances
and
situation
and
render
the
observance
of
the
laws
of
justice
our
nearest
interest
and
their
violation
our
most
remote
but
this
being
impracticable
with
respect
to
all
mankind
it
can
only
take
place
with
respect
to
a
few
whom
we
thus
immediately
interest
in
the
execution
of
justice
there
are
the
persons
whom
we
call
civil
magistrates
kings
and
their
ministers
our
governors
and
rulers
who
being
indifferent
persons
to
the
greatest
part
of
the
state
have
no
interest
or
but
a
remote
one
in
any
act
of
injustice
and
being
satisfied
with
their
present
condition
and
with
their
part
in
society
have
an
immediate
interest
in
every
execution
of
justice
which
is
so
necessary
to
the
upholding
of
society
here
then
is
the
origin
of
civil
government
and
society
men
are
not
able
radically
to
cure
either
in
themselves
or
others
that
narrowness
of
soul
which
makes
them
prefer
the
present
to
the
remote
they
can
not
change
their
natures
all
they
can
do
is
to
change
their
situation
and
render
the
observance
of
justice
the
immediate
interest
of
some
particular
persons
and
its
violation
their
more
remote
these
persons
then
are
not
only
induced
to
observe
those
rules
in
their
own
conduct
but
also
to
constrain
others
to
a
like
regularity
and
inforce
the
dictates
of
equity
through
the
whole
society
and
if
it
be
necessary
they
may
also
interest
others
more
immediately
in
the
execution
of
justice
and
create
a
number
of
officers
civil
and
military
to
assist
them
in
their
government
but
this
execution
of
justice
though
the
principal
is
not
the
only
advantage
of
government
as
violent
passion
hinder
men
from
seeing
distinctly
the
interest
they
have
in
an
equitable
behaviour
towards
others
so
it
hinders
them
from
seeing
that
equity
itself
and
gives
them
a
remarkable
partiality
in
their
own
favours
this
inconvenience
is
corrected
in
the
same
manner
as
that
the
same
persons
who
execute
the
laws
of
justice
will
also
decide
all
controversies
concerning
them
and
being
indifferent
to
the
greatest
part
of
the
society
will
decide
them
more
equitably
than
every
one
would
in
his
own
case
by
means
of
these
two
advantages
in
the
execution
and
decision
of
justice
men
acquire
a
security
against
each
others
weakness
and
passion
as
well
as
against
their
own
and
under
the
shelter
of
their
governors
begin
to
taste
at
ease
the
sweets
of
society
and
mutual
assistance
but
government
extends
farther
its
beneficial
influence
and
not
contented
to
protect
men
in
those
conventions
they
make
for
their
mutual
interest
it
often
obliges
them
to
make
such
conventions
and
forces
them
to
seek
their
own
advantage
by
a
concurrence
in
some
common
end
or
purpose
there
is
no
quality
in
human
nature
which
causes
more
fatal
errors
in
our
conduct
than
that
which
leads
us
to
prefer
whatever
is
present
to
the
distant
and
remote
and
makes
us
desire
objects
more
according
to
their
situation
than
their
intrinsic
value
two
neighbours
may
agree
to
drain
a
meadow
which
they
possess
in
common
because
it
is
easy
for
them
to
know
each
others
mind
and
each
must
perceive
that
the
immediate
consequence
of
his
failing
in
his
part
is
the
abandoning
the
whole
project
but
it
is
very
difficult
and
indeed
impossible
that
a
thousand
persons
should
agree
in
any
such
action
it
being
difficult
for
them
to
concert
so
complicated
a
design
and
still
more
difficult
for
them
to
execute
it
while
each
seeks
a
pretext
to
free
himself
of
the
trouble
and
expence
and
would
lay
the
whole
burden
on
others
political
society
easily
remedies
both
these
inconveniences
magistrates
find
an
immediate
interest
in
the
interest
of
any
considerable
part
of
their
subjects
they
need
consult
no
body
but
themselves
to
form
any
scheme
for
the
promoting
of
that
interest
and
as
the
failure
of
any
one
piece
in
the
execution
is
connected
though
not
immediately
with
the
failure
of
the
whole
they
prevent
that
failure
because
they
find
no
interest
in
it
either
immediate
or
remote

human
infirmities
becomes
by

of
the
finest
and
most
subtle
inventions
imaginable
a
composition

is
in

measure
exempted

these
infirmities

of
the
source
of
allegiance
though
government
be
an
invention
very
advantageous
and
even
in
some
circumstances
absolutely
necessary
to
mankind
it
is
not
necessary
in
all
circumstances
nor
is
it
impossible
for
men
to
preserve
society
for
some
time
without
having
recourse
to
such
an
invention
men
it
is
true
are
always
much
inclined
to
prefer
present
interest
to
distant
and
remote
nor
is
it
easy
for
them
to
resist
the
temptation
of
any
advantage
that
they
may
immediately
enjoy
in
apprehension
of
an
evil
that
lies
at
a
distance
from
them
but
still
this
weakness
is
less
conspicuous
where
the
possessions
and
the
pleasures
of
life
are
few
and
of
little
value
as
they
always
are
in
the
infancy
of
society
an
indian
is
but
little
tempted
to
dispossess
another
of
his
hut
or
to
steal
his
bow
as
being
already
provided
of
the
same
advantages
and
as
to
any
superior
fortune
which
may
attend
one
above
another
in
hunting
and
fishing
it
is
only
casual
and
temporary
and
will
have
but
small
tendency
to
disturb
society
and
so
far
am
i
from
thinking
with
some
philosophers
that
men
are
utterly
incapable
of
society
without
government
that
i
assert
the
first
rudiments
of
government
to
arise
from
quarrels
not
among
men
of
the
same
society
but
among
those
of
different
societies
a
less
degree
of
riches
will
suffice
to
this
latter
effect
than
is
requisite
for
the
former
men
fear
nothing
from
public
war
and
violence
but
the
resistance
they
meet
with
which
because
they
share
it
in
common
seems
less
terrible
and
because
it
comes
from
strangers
seems
less
pernicious
in
its
consequences
than
when
they
are
exposed
singly
against
one
whose
commerce
is
advantageous
to
them
and
without
whose
society
it
is
impossible
they
can
subsist

any

among

quarrelling
while
each
strives
to
get
possession
of
what
pleases
him
without
regard
to
the
consequences
in
a
foreign
war
the
most
considerable
of
all
goods
life
and
limbs
are
at
stake
and
as
every
one
shuns

ports
seizes
the
best
arms
seeks
excuse
for
the
slightest
wounds
the
laws
which
may
be
well
enough
observed
while
men
were
calm
can
now
no
longer
take
place
when
they
are
in
such
commotion
this
we
find
verified
in
the
american
tribes
where
men
live
in
concord
and
amity
among
themselves
without
any
established
government
and
never
pay
submission
to
any
of
their
fellows
except
in
time
of
war
when
their
captain
enjoys
a
shadow
of
authority
which
he
loses
after
their
return
from
the
field
and
the
establishment
of
peace
with
the
neighbouring
tribes
this
authority
however
instructs
them
in
the
advantages
of
government
and
teaches
them
to
have
recourse
to
it
when
either
by
the
pillage
of
war
by
commerce
or
by
any
fortuitous
inventions
their
riches
and
possessions
have
become
so
considerable
as
to
make
them
forget
on
every
emergence
the
interest
they
have
in
the
preservation
of
peace
and
justice
hence
we
may
give
a
plausible
reason
among
others
why
all
governments
are
at
first
monarchical
without
any
mixture
and
variety
and
why
republics
arise
only
from
the
abuses
of
monarchy
and
despotic
power
camps
are
the
true
mothers
of
cities
and
as
war
can
not
be
administered
by
reason
of
the
suddenness
of
every
exigency
without
some
authority
in
a
single
person
the
same
kind
of
authority
naturally
takes
place
in
that
civil
government
which
succeeds
the
military
and
this
reason
i
take
to
be
more
natural
than
the
common
one
derived
from
patriarchal
government
or
the
authority
of
a
father
which
is
said
first
to
take
place
in
one
family
and
to
accustom
the
members
of
it
to
the
government
of
a
single
person
the
state
of
society
without
government
is
one
of
the
most
natural
states
of
men
and
must
submit
with
the
conjunction
of
many
families
and
long
after
the
first
generation
nothing
but
an
encrease
of
riches
and
possessions
coued
oblige
men
to
quit
it
and
so
barbarous
and
uninstructed
are
all
societies
on
their
first
formation
that
many
years
must
elapse
before
these
can
encrease
to
such
a
degree
as
to
disturb
men
in
the
enjoyment
of
peace
and
concord
but
though
it
be
possible
for
men
to
maintain
a
small
uncultivated
society
without
government
it
is
impossible
they
should
maintain
a
society
of
any
kind
without
justice
and
the
observance
of
those
three
fundamental
laws
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
its
translation
by
consent
and
the
performance
of
promises
these
are
therefore
antecedent
to
government
and
are
supposed
to
impose
an
obligation
before
the
duty
of
allegiance
to
civil
magistrates
has
once
been
thought
of
nay
i
shall
go
farther
and
assert
that
government
upon
its
first
establishment
would
naturally
be
supposed
to
derive
its
obligation
from
those
laws
of
nature
and
in
particular
from
that
concerning
the
performance
of
promises
when
men
have
once
perceived
the
necessity
of
government
to
maintain
peace
and
execute
justice
they
would
naturally
assemble
together
would
chuse
magistrates
determine
power
and
promise
them
obedience
as
a
promise
is
supposed
to
be
a
bond
or
security
already
in
use
and
attended
with
a
moral
obligation
it
is
to
be
considered
as
the
original
sanction
of
government
and
as
the
source
of
the
first
obligation
to
obedience
this
reasoning
appears
so
natural
that
it
has
become
the
foundation
of
our
fashionable
system
of
politics
and
is
in
a
manner
the
creed
of
a
party
amongst
us
who
pride
themselves
with
reason
on
the
soundness
of
their
philosophy
and
their
liberty
of
thought
all
men
say
they
are
born
free
and
equal
government
and
superiority
can
only
be
established
by
consent
the
consent
of
men
in
establishing
government
imposes
on
them
a
new
obligation
unknown
to
the
laws
of
nature
men
therefore
are
bound
to
obey
their
magistrates
only
because
they
promise
it
and
if
they
had
not
given
their
word
either
expressly
or
tacitly
to
preserve
allegiance
it
would
never
have
become
a
part
of
their
moral
duty
this
conclusion
however
when
carried
so
far
as
to
comprehend
government
in
all
its
ages
and
situations
is
entirely
erroneous
and
i
maintain
that
though
the
duty
of
allegiance
be
at
first
grafted
on
the
obligation
of
promises
and
be
for
some
time
supported
by
that
obligation
yet
it
quickly
takes
root
of
itself
and
has
an
original
obligation
and
authority
independent
of
all
contracts
this
is
a
principle
of
moment
which
we
must
examine
with
care
and
attention
before
we
proceed
any
farther
it
is
reasonable
for
those
philosophers
who
assert
justice
to
be
a
natural
virtue
and
antecedent
to
human
conventions
to
resolve
all
civil
allegiance
into
the
obligation
of
a
promise
and
assert
that
it
is
our
own
consent
alone
which
binds
us
to
any
submission
to
magistracy
for
as
all
government
is
plainly
an
invention
of
men
and
the
origin
of
most
governments
is
known
in
history
it
is
necessary
to
mount
higher
in
order
to
find
the
source
of
our
political
duties
if
we
would
assert
them
to
have
any
natural
obligation
of
morality
these
philosophers
therefore
quickly
observe
that
society
is
as
antient
as
the
human
species
and
those
three
fundamental
laws
of
nature
as
antient
as
society
so
that
taking
advantage
of
the
antiquity
and
obscure
origin
of
these
laws
they
first
deny
them
to
be
artificial
and
voluntary
inventions
of
men
and
then
seek
to
ingraft
on
them
those
other
duties
which
are
more
plainly
artificial
but
being
once
undeceived
in
this
particular
and
having
found
that
natural
as
well
as
civil
justice
derives
its
origin
from
human
conventions
we
shall
quickly
perceive
how
fruitless
it
is
to
resolve
the
one
into
the
other
and
seek
in
the
laws
of
nature
a
stronger
foundation
for
our
political
duties
than
interest
and
human
conventions
while
these
laws
themselves
are
built
on
the
very
same
foundation
on
which
ever
side
we
turn
this
subject
we
shall
find
that
these
two
kinds
of
duty
are
exactly
on
the
same
footing
and
have
the
same
source
both
of
their
first
invention
and
moral
obligation
they
are
contrived
to
remedy
like
inconveniences
and
acquire
their
moral
sanction
in
the
same
manner
from
their
remedying
those
inconveniences
these
are
two
points
which
we
shall
endeavour
to
prove
as
distinctly
as
possible
we
have
already
shewn
that
men
invented
the
three
fundamental
laws
of
nature
when
they
observed
the
necessity
of
society
to
their
mutual
subsistance
and
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
maintain
any
correspondence
together
without
some
restraint
on
their
natural
appetites
the
same
therefore
which
renders
men
so
incommodious
to
each
other
taking
a
new
and
more
convenient
direction
produces
the
rules
of
justice
and
is
the
first
motive
of
their
observance
but
when
men
have
observed
that
though
the
rules
of
justice
be
sufficient
to
maintain
any
society
yet
it
is
impossible
for
them
of
themselves
to
observe
those
rules
in
large
and
polished
societies
they
establish
government
as
a
new
invention
to
attain
their
ends
and
preserve
the
old
or
procure
new
advantages
by
a
more
strict
execution
of
justice
so
far
therefore
our
civil
duties
are
connected
with
our
natural
that
the
former
are
invented
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
the
latter
and
that
the
principal
object
of
government
is
to
constrain
men
to
observe
the
laws
of
nature
in
this
respect
however
that
law
of
nature
concerning
the
performance
of
promises
is
only
comprized
along
with
the
rest
and
its
exact
observance
is
to
be
considered
as
an
effect
of
the
institution
of
government
and
not
the
obedience
to
government
as
an
effect
of
the
obligation
of
a
promise
though
the
object
of
our
civil
duties
be
the
enforcing
of
our
natural
yet
the
first
first
in
time
not
in
dignity
or
force
motive
of
the
invention
as
well
as
performance
of
both
is
nothing
but
and
since
there
is
a
separate
interest
in
the
obedience
to
government
from
that
in
the
performance
of
promises
we
must
also
allow
of
a
separate
obligation
to
obey
the
civil
magistrate
is
requisite
to
preserve
order
and
concord
in
society
to
perform
promises
is
requisite
to
beget
mutual
trust
and
confidence
in
the
common
offices
of
life
the
ends
as
well
as
the
means
are
perfectly
distinct
nor
is
the
one
subordinate
to
the
other
to
make
this
more
evident
let
us
consider
that
men
will
often
bind
themselves
by
promises
to
the
performance
of
what
it
would
have
been
their
interest
to
perform
independent
of
these
promises
as
when
they
would
give
others
a
fuller
security
by
a
new
obligation
of
interest
to
that
which
they
formerly
lay
under
the
interest
in
the
performance
of
promises
besides
its
moral
obligation
is
general
avowed
and
of
the
last
consequence
in
life
other
interests
may
be
more
particular
and
doubtful
and
we
are
apt
to
entertain
a
greater
suspicion
that
men
may
indulge
their
humour
or
passion
in
acting
contrary
to
them
here
therefore
promises
come
naturally
in
play
and
are
often
required
for
fuller
satisfaction
and
security
but
supposing
those
other
interests
to
be
as
general
and
avowed
as
the
interest
in
the
performance
of
a
promise
they
will
be
regarded
as
on
the
same
footing
and
men
will
begin
to
repose
the
same
confidence
in
them
now
this
is
exactly
the
case
with
regard
to
our
civil
duties
or
obedience
to
the
magistrate
without
which
no
government
coued
subsist
nor
any
peace
or
order
be
maintained
in
large
societies
where
there
are
so
many
possessions
on
the
one
hand
and
so
many
wants
real
or
imaginary
on
the
other
our
civil
duties
therefore
must
soon
detach
themselves
from
our
promises
and
acquire
a
separate
force
and
influence
the
interest
in
both
is
of
the
very
same
kind
it
is
general
avowed
and
prevails
in
all
times
and
places
there
is
then
no
pretext
of
reason
for
founding
the
one
upon
the
other
while
each
of
them
has
a
foundation
peculiar
to
itself
we
might
as
well
resolve
the
obligation
to
abstain
from
the
possessions
of
others
into
the
obligation
of
a
promise
as
that
of
allegiance
the
interests
are
not
more
distinct
in
the
one
case
than
the
other
a
regard
to
property
is
not
more
necessary
to
natural
society
than
obedience
is
to
civil
society
or
government
nor
is
the
former
society
more
necessary
to
the
being
of
mankind
than
the
latter
to
their
and
happiness
in
short
if
the
performance
of
promises
be
advantageous
so
is
obedience
to
government
if
the
former
interest
be
general
so
is
the
latter
if
the
one
interest
be
obvious
and
avowed
so
is
the
other
and
as
these
two
rules
are
founded
on
like
obligations
of
interest
each
of
them
must
have
a
peculiar
authority
independent
of
the
other
but
it
is
not
only
the
natural
obligations
of
interest
which
are
distinct
in
promises
and
allegiance
but
also
the
moral
obligations
of
honour
and
conscience
nor
does
the
merit
or
demerit
of
the
one
depend
in
the
least
upon
that
of
the
other
and
indeed
if
we
consider
the
close
connexion
there
is
betwixt
the
natural
and
moral
obligations
we
shall
find
this
conclusion
to
be
entirely
unavoidable
our
interest
is
always
engaged
on
the
side
of
obedience
to
magistracy
and
there
is
nothing
but
a
great
present
advantage
that
can
lead
us
to
rebellion
by
making
us
the
remote
interest
which
we
have
in
the
preserving
of
peace
and
order
in
society
but
though
a
present
interest
may
thus
blind
us
with
regard
to
our
own
actions
it
takes
not
place
with
regard
to
those
of
others
nor
hinders
them
from
appearing
in
their
true
colours
as
highly
prejudicial
to
public
interest
and
to
our
own
in
particular
this
naturally
gives
us
an
uneasiness
in
considering
such
seditious
and
disloyal
actions
and
makes
us
attach
to
them
the
idea
of
vice
and
moral
deformity
it
is
the
same
principle
which
causes
us
to
disapprove
of
all
kinds
of
private
injustice
and
in
particular
of
the
breach
of
promises
we
blame
all
treachery
and
breach
of
faith
because
we
consider
that
the
freedom
and
extent
of
human
commerce
depend
entirely
on
a
fidelity
with
regard
to
promises
we
blame
all
disloyalty
to
magistrates
because
we
perceive
that
the
execution
of
justice
in
the
stability
of
possession
its
translation
by
consent
and
the
performance
of
promises
is
impossible
without
submission
to
government
as
there
are
here
two
interests
entirely
distinct
from
each
other
they
must
give
rise
to
two
moral
obligations
equally
separate
and
independent
though
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
promise
in
the
world
government
would
still
be
necessary
in
all
large
and
civilized
societies
and
if
promises
had
only
their
own
proper
obligation
without
the
separate
sanction
of
government
they
would
have
but
little
efficacy
in
such
societies
this
separates
the
boundaries
of
our
public
and
private
duties
and
shews
that
the
latter
are
more
dependant
on
the
former
than
the
former
on
the
latter
education
and
the
artifice
of
politicians
concur
to
bestow
a
farther
morality
on
loyalty
and
to
brand
all
rebellion
with
a
greater
degree
of
guilt
and
infamy
nor
is
it
a
wonder
that
politicians
should
be
very
industrious
in
inculcating
such
notions
where
their
interest
is
so
particularly
concerned
lest
those
arguments
should
not
appear
entirely
conclusive
as
i
think
they
are
i
shall
have
recourse
to
authority
and
shall
prove
from
the
universal
consent
of
mankind
that
the
obligation
of
submission
to
government
is
not
derived
from
any
promise
of
the
subjects
nor
need
any
one
wonder
that
though
i
have
all
along
endeavoured
to
establish
my
system
on
pure
reason
and
have
scarce
ever
cited
the
judgment
even
of
philosophers
or
historians
on
any
article
i
should
now
appeal
to
popular
authority
and
oppose
the
sentiments
of
the
rabble
to
any
philosophical
reasoning
for
it
must
be
observed
that
the
opinions
of
men
in
this
case
carry
with
them
a
peculiar
authority
and
are
in
a
great
measure
infallible
the
distinction
of
moral
good
and
evil
is
founded
on
the
pleasure
or
pain
which
results
from
the
view
of
any
sentiment
or
character
and
as
that
pleasure
or
pain
can
not
be
unknown
to
the
person
who
feels
it
it
follows
footnote
that
there
is
just
so
much
vice
or
virtue
in
any
character
as
every
one
places
in
it
and
that
it
is
impossible
in
this
particular
we
can
ever
be
mistaken
and
though
our
judgments
concerning
the
origin
of
any
vice
or
virtue
be
not
so
certain
as
those
concerning
their
degrees
yet
since
the
question
in
this
case
regards
not
any
philosophical
origin
of
an
obligation
but
a
plain
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
easily
conceived
how
we
can
fall
into
an
error
a
man
who
acknowledges
himself
to
be
bound
to
another
for
a
certain
sum
must
certainly
know
whether
it
be
by
his
own
bond
or
that
of
his
father
whether
it
be
of
his
mere
or
for
money
lent
him
and
under
what
conditions
and
for
what
purposes
he
has
bound
himself
in
like
manner
it
being
certain
that
there
is
a
moral
obligation
to
submit
to
government
because
every
one
thinks
so
it
must
be
as
certain
that
this
obligation
arises
not
from
a
promise
since
no
one
whose
judgment
has
not
been
led
astray
by
too
strict
adherence
to
a
system
of
philosophy
has
ever
yet
dreamt
of
ascribing
it
to
that
origin
neither
magistrates
nor
subjects
have
formed
this
idea
of
our
civil
duties
footnote
this
proposition
must
hold
strictly
true
with
regard
to
every
quality
that
is
determin
merely
by
sentiment
in
what
sense
we
can
talk
either
of
a
right
or
a
wrong
taste
in
morals
eloquence
or
beauty
shall
be
considerd
afterwards
in
the
mean
time
it
may
be
observ
that
there
is
such
an
uniformity
in
the
general
sentiments
of
mankind
as
to
render
such
questions
of
but
small
importance
we
find
that
magistrates
are
so
far
from
deriving
their
authority
and
the
obligation
to
obedience
in
their
subjects
from
the
foundation
of
a
promise
or
original
contract
that
they
conceal
as
far
as
possible
from
their
people
especially
from
the
vulgar
that
they
have
their
origin
from
thence
were
this
the
sanction
of
government
our
rulers
would
never
receive
it
tacitly
which
is
the
utmost
that
can
be
pretended
since
what
is
given
tacitly
and
insensibly
can
never
have
such
influence
on
mankind
as
what
is
performed
expressly
and
openly
a
tacit
promise
is
where
the
will
is
signified
by
other
more
diffuse
signs
than
those
of
speech
but
a
will
there
must
certainly
be
in
the
case
and
that
can
never
escape
the
person
notice
who
exerted
it
however
silent
or
tacit
but
were
you
to
ask
the
far
greatest
part
of
the
nation
whether
they
had
ever
consented
to
the
authority
of
their
rulers
or
promised
to
obey
them
they
would
be
inclined
to
think
very
strangely
of
you
and
would
certainly
reply
that
the
affair
depended
not
on
their
consent
but
that
they
were
born
to
such
an
obedience
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
we
frequently
see
them
imagine
such
persons
to
be
their
natural
rulers
as
are
at
that
time
deprived
of
all
power
and
authority
and
whom
no
man
however
foolish
would
voluntarily
chuse
and
this
merely
because
they
are
in
that
line
which
ruled
before
and
in
that
degree
of
it
which
used
to
succeed
though
perhaps
in
so
distant
a
period
that
scarce
any
man
alive
coued
ever
have
given
any
promise
of
obedience
has
a
government
then
no
authority
over
such
as
these
because
they
never
consented
to
it
and
would
esteem
the
very
attempt
of
such
a
free
choice
a
piece
of
arrogance
and
impiety
we
find
by
experience
that
it
punishes
them
very
freely
for
what
it
calls
treason
and
rebellion
which
it
seems
according
to
this
system
reduces
itself
to
common
injustice
if
you
say
that
by
dwelling
in
its
dominions
they
in
effect
consented
to
the
established
government
i
answer
that
this
can
only
be
where
they
think
the
affair
depends
on
their
choice
which
few
or
none
beside
those
philosophers
have
ever
yet
imagined
it
never
was
pleaded
as
an
excuse
for
a
rebel
that
the
first
act
he
perform
d
after
he
came
to
years
of
discretion
was
to
levy
war
against
the
sovereign
of
the
state
and
that
while
he
was
a
child
he
coued
not
bind
himself
by
his
own
consent
and
having
become
a
man
showed
plainly
by
the
first
act
he
performed
that
he
had
no
design
to
impose
on
himself
any
obligation
to
obedience
we
find
on
the
contrary
that
civil
laws
punish
this
crime
at
the
same
age
as
any
other
which
is
criminal
of
itself
without
our
consent
that
is
when
the
person
is
come
to
the
full
use
of
reason
whereas
to
this
crime
they
ought
in
justice
to
allow
some
intermediate
time
in
which
a
tacit
consent
at
least
might
be
supposed
to
which
we
may
add
that
a
man
living
under
an
absolute
government
would
owe
it
no
allegiance
since
by
its
very
nature
it
depends
not
on
consent
but
as
that
is
as
natural
and
common
a
government
as
any
it
must
certainly
occasion
some
obligation
and
it
is
plain
from
experience
that
men
who
are
subjected
to
it
do
always
think
so
this
is
a
clear
proof
that
we
do
not
commonly
esteem
our
allegiance
to
be
derived
from
our
consent
or
promise
and
a
farther
proof
is
that
when
our
promise
is
upon
any
account
expressly
engaged
we
always
distinguish
exactly
betwixt
the
two
obligations
and
believe
the
one
to
add
more
force
to
the
other
than
in
a
repetition
of
the
same
promise
where
no
promise
is
given
a
man
looks
not
on
his
faith
as
broken
in
private
matters
upon
account
of
rebellion
but
keeps
those
two
duties
of
honour
and
allegiance
perfectly
distinct
and
separate
as
the
uniting
of
them
was
thought
by
these
philosophers
a
very
subtile
invention
this
is
a
convincing
proof
that
it
is
not
a
true
one
since
no
man
can
either
give
a
promise
or
be
restrained
by
its
sanction
and
obligation
unknown
to
himself
sect
ix
of
the
measures
of
allegiance
those
political
writers
who
have
had
recourse
to
a
promise
or
original
contract
as
the
source
of
our
allegiance
to
government
intended
to
establish
a
principle
which
is
perfectly
just
and
reasonable
though
the
reasoning
upon
which
they
endeavoured
to
establish
it
was
fallacious
and
sophistical
they
would
prove
that
our
submission
to
government
admits
of
exceptions
and
that
an
egregious
tyranny
in
the
rulers
is
sufficient
to
free
the
subjects
from
all
ties
of
allegiance
since
men
enter
into
society
say
they
and
submit
themselves
to
government
by
their
free
and
voluntary
consent
they
must
have
in
view
certain
advantages
which
they
propose
to
reap
from
it
and
for
which
they
are
contented
to
resign
their
native
liberty
there
is
therefore
something
mutual
engaged
on
the
part
of
the
magistrate
viz
protection
and
security
and
it
is
only
by
the
hopes
he
affords
of
these
advantages
that
he
can
ever
persuade
men
to
submit
to
him
but
when
instead
of
protection
and
security
they
meet
with
tyranny
and
oppression
they
are
freeed
from
their
promises
as
happens
in
all
conditional
contracts
and
return
to
that
state
of
liberty
which
preceded
the
institution
of
government
men
would
never
be
so
foolish
as
to
enter
into
such
engagements
as
should
turn
entirely
to
the
advantage
of
others
without
any
view
of
bettering
their
own
condition
whoever
proposes
to
draw
any
profit
from
our
submission
must
engage
himself
either
expressly
or
tacitly
to
make
us
reap
some
advantage
from
his
authority
nor
ought
he
to
expect
that
without
the
performance
of
his
part
we
will
ever
continue
in
obedience
i
repeat
it
this
conclusion
is
just
though
the
principles
be
erroneous
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
can
establish
the
same
conclusion
on
more
reasonable
principles
i
shall
not
take
such
a
compass
in
establishing
our
political
duties
as
to
assert
that
men
perceive
the
advantages
of
government
that
they
institute
government
with
a
view
to
those
advantages
that
this
institution
requires
a
promise
of
obedience
which
imposes
a
moral
obligation
to
a
certain
degree
but
being
conditional
ceases
to
be
binding
whenever
the
other
contracting
party
performs
not
his
part
of
the
engagement
i
perceive
that
a
promise
itself
arises
entirely
from
human
conventions
and
is
invented
with
a
view
to
a
certain
interest
i
seek
therefore
some
such
interest
more
immediately
connected
with
government
and
which
may
be
at
once
the
original
motive
to
its
institution
and
the
source
of
our
obedience
to
it
this
interest
i
find
to
consist
in
the
security
and
protection
which
we
enjoy
in
political
society
and
which
we
can
never
attain
when
perfectly
free
and
independent
as
interest
therefore
is
the
immediate
sanction
of
government
the
one
can
have
no
longer
being
than
the
other
and
whenever
the
civil
magistrate
carries
his
oppression
so
far
as
to
render
his
authority
perfectly
intolerable
we
are
no
longer
bound
to
submit
to
it
the
cause
ceases
the
effect
must
cease
also
so
far
the
conclusion
is
immediate
and
direct
concerning
the
natural
obligation
which
we
have
to
allegiance
as
to
the
moral
obligation
we
may
observe
that
the
maxim
would
here
be
false
that
when
the
cause
ceases
the
effect
must
cease
also
for
there
is
a
principle
of
human
nature
which
we
have
frequently
taken
notice
of
that
men
are
mightily
addicted
to
general
rules
and
that
we
often
carry
our
maxims
beyond
those
reasons
which
first
induced
us
to
establish
them
where
cases
are
similar
in
many
circumstances
we
are
apt
to
put
them
on
the
same
footing
without
considering
that
they
differ
in
the
most
material
circumstances
and
that
the
resemblance
is
more
apparent
than
real
it
may
therefore
be
thought
that
in
the
case
of
allegiance
our
moral
obligation
of
duty
will
not
cease
even
though
the
natural
obligation
of
interest
which
is
its
cause
has
ceased
and
that
men
may
be
bound
by
conscience
to
submit
to
a
tyrannical
government
against
their
own
and
the
public
interest
and
indeed
to
the
force
of
this
argument
i
so
far
submit
as
to
acknowledge
that
general
rules
commonly
extend
beyond
the
principles
on
which
they
are
founded
and
that
we
seldom
make
any
exception
to
them
unless
that
exception
have
the
qualities
of
a
general
rule
and
be
founded
on
very
numerous
and
common
instances
now
this
i
assert
to
be
entirely
the
present
case
when
men
submit
to
the
authority
of
others
it
is
to
procure
themselves
some
security
against
the
wickedness
and
injustice
of
men
who
are
perpetually
carried
by
their
unruly
passions
and
by
their
present
and
immediate
interest
to
the
violation
of
all
the
laws
of
society
but
as
this
imperfection
is
inherent
in
human
nature
we
know
that
it
must
attend
men
in
all
their
states
and
conditions
and
that
these
whom
we
chuse
for
rulers
do
not
immediately
become
of
a
superior
nature
to
the
rest
of
mankind
upon
account
of
their
superior
power
and
authority
what
we
expect
from
them
depends
not
on
a
change
of
their
nature
but
of
their
situation
when
they
acquire
a
more
immediate
interest
in
the
preservation
of
order
and
the
execution
of
justice
but
besides
that
this
interest
is
only
more
immediate
in
the
execution
of
justice
among
their
subjects
besides
this
i
say
we
may
often
expect
from
the
irregularity
of
human
nature
that
they
will
neglect
even
this
immediate
interest
and
be
transported
by
their
passions
into
all
the
excesses
of
cruelty
and
our
general
knowledge
of
human
nature
our
observation
of
the
past
history
of
mankind
our
experience
of
present
times
all
these
causes
must
induce
us
to
open
the
door
to
exceptions
and
must
make
us
conclude
that
we
may
resist
the
more
violent
effects
of
supreme
power
without
any
crime
or
injustice
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
this
is
both
the
general
practice
and
principle
of
mankind
and
that
no
nation
that
coued
find
any
remedy
ever
yet
suffered
the
cruel
ravages
of
a
tyrant
or
were
blamed
for
their
resistance
those
who
took
up
arms
against
dionysius
or
nero
or
philip
the
second
have
the
favour
of
every
reader
in
the
perusal
of
their
history
and
nothing
but
the
most
violent
perversion
of
common
sense
can
ever
lead
us
to
condemn
them
it
is
certain
therefore
that
in
all
our
notions
of
morals
we
never
entertain
such
an
absurdity
as
that
of
passive
obedience
but
make
allowances
for
resistance
in
the
more
flagrant
instances
of
tyranny
and
oppression
the
general
opinion
of
mankind
has
some
authority
in
all
cases
but
in
this
of
morals
it
is
perfectly
infallible
nor
is
it
less
infallible
because
men
can
not
distinctly
explain
the
principles
on
which
it
is
founded
few
persons
can
carry
on
this
train
of
reasoning
government
is
a
mere
human
invention
for
the
interest
of
society
where
the
tyranny
of
the
governor
removes
this
interest
it
also
removes
the
natural
obligation
to
obedience
the
moral
obligation
is
founded
on
the
natural
and
therefore
must
cease
where
that
ceases
especially
where
the
subject
is
such
as
makes
us
foresee
very
many
occasions
wherein
the
natural
obligation
may
cease
and
causes
us
to
form
a
kind
of
general
rule
for
the
regulation
of
our
conduct
in
such
occurrences
but
though
this
train
of
reasoning
be
too
subtile
for
the
vulgar
it
is
certain
that
all
men
have
an
implicit
notion
of
it
and
are
sensible
that
they
owe
obedience
to
government
merely
on
account
of
the
public
interest
and
at
the
same
time
that
human
nature
is
so
subject
to
frailties
and
passions
as
may
easily
pervert
this
institution
and
change
their
governors
into
tyrants
and
public
enemies
if
the
sense
of
common
interest
were
not
our
original
motive
to
obedience
i
would
fain
ask
what
other
principle
is
there
in
human
nature
capable
of
subduing
the
natural
ambition
of
men
and
forcing
them
to
such
a
submission
imitation
and
custom
are
not
sufficient
for
the
question
still
recurs
what
motive
first
produces
those
instances
of
submission
which
we
imitate
and
that
train
of
actions
which
produces
the
custom
there
evidently
is
no
other
principle
than
public
interest
and
if
interest
first
produces
obedience
to
government
the
obligation
to
obedience
must
cease
whenever
the
interest
ceases
in
any
great
degree
and
in
a
considerable
number
of
instances
sect
x
of
the
objects
of
allegiance
but
though
on
some
occasions
it
may
be
justifiable
both
in
sound
politics
and
morality
to
resist
supreme
power
it
is
certain
that
in
the
ordinary
course
of
human
affairs
nothing
can
be
more
pernicious
and
criminal
and
that
besides
the
convulsions
which
always
attend
revolutions
such
a
practice
tends
directly
to
the
subversion
of
all
government
and
the
causing
an
universal
anarchy
and
confusion
among
mankind
as
numerous
and
civilized
societies
can
not
subsist
without
government
so
government
is
entirely
useless
without
an
exact
obedience
we
ought
always
to
weigh
the
advantages
which
we
reap
from
authority
against
the
disadvantages
and
by
this
means
we
shall
become
more
scrupulous
of
putting
in
practice
the
doctrine
of
resistance
the
common
rule
requires
submission
and
it
is
only
in
cases
of
grievous
tyranny
and
oppression
that
the
exception
can
take
place
since
then
such
a
blind
submission
is
commonly
due
to
magistracy
the
next
question
is
to
whom
it
is
due
and
whom
we
are
to
regard
as
our
lawful
magistrates
in
order
to
answer
this
question
let
us
recollect
what
we
have
already
established
concerning
the
origin
of
government
and
political
society
when
men
have
once
experienced
the
impossibility
of
preserving
any
steady
order
in
society
while
every
one
is
his
own
master
and
violates
or
observes
the
laws
of
society
according
to
his
present
interest
or
pleasure
they
naturally
run
into
the
invention
of
government
and
put
it
out
of
their
own
power
as
far
as
possible
to
transgress
the
laws
of
society
government
therefore
arises
from
the
same
voluntary
conversation
of
men
and
it
is
evident
that
the
same
convention
which
establishes
government
will
also
determine
the
persons
who
are
to
govern
and
will
remove
all
doubt
and
ambiguity
in
this
particular
and
the
voluntary
consent
of
men
must
here
have
the
greater
efficacy
that
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
does
at
first
stand
upon
the
foundation
of
a
promise
of
the
subjects
by
which
they
bind
themselves
to
obedience
as
in
every
other
contract
or
engagement
the
same
promise
then
which
binds
them
to
obedience
ties
them
down
to
a
particular
person
and
makes
him
the
object
of
their
allegiance
but
when
government
has
been
established
on
this
footing
for
some
considerable
time
and
the
separate
interest
which
we
have
in
submission
has
produced
a
separate
sentiment
of
morality
the
case
is
entirely
altered
and
a
promise
is
no
longer
able
to
determine
the
particular
magistrate
since
it
is
no
longer
considered
as
the
foundation
of
government
we
naturally
suppose
ourselves
born
to
submission
and
imagine
that
such
particular
persons
have
a
right
to
command
as
we
on
our
part
are
bound
to
obey
these
notions
of
right
and
obligation
are
derived
from
nothing
but
the
advantage
we
reap
from
government
which
gives
us
a
repugnance
to
practise
resistance
ourselves
and
makes
us
displeased
with
any
instance
of
it
in
others
but
here
it
is
remarkable
that
in
this
new
state
of
affairs
the
original
sanction
of
government
which
is
interest
is
not
admitted
to
determine
the
persons
whom
we
are
to
obey
as
the
original
sanction
did
at
first
when
affairs
were
on
the
footing
of
a
promise
a
promise
fixes
and
determines
the
persons
without
any
uncertainty
but
it
is
evident
that
if
men
were
to
regulate
their
conduct
in
this
particular
by
the
view
of
a
peculiar
interest
either
public
or
private
they
would
involve
themselves
in
endless
confusion
and
would
render
all
government
in
a
great
measure
ineffectual
the
private
interest
of
every
one
is
different
and
though
the
public
interest
in
itself
be
always
one
and
the
same
yet
it
becomes
the
source
of
as
great
dissentions
by
reason
of
the
different
opinions
of
particular
persons
concerning
it
the
same
interest
therefore
which
causes
us
to
submit
to
magistracy
makes
us
renounce
itself
in
the
choice
of
our
magistrates
and
binds
us
down
to
a
certain
form
of
government
and
to
particular
persons
without
allowing
us
to
aspire
to
the
utmost
perfection
in
either
the
case
is
here
the
same
as
in
that
law
of
nature
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
it
is
highly
advantageous
and
even
absolutely
necessary
to
society
that
possession
should
be
stable
and
this
leads
us
to
the
establishment
of
such
a
rule
but
we
find
that
were
we
to
follow
the
same
advantage
in
assigning
particular
possessions
to
particular
persons
we
should
disappoint
our
end
and
perpetuate
the
confusion
which
that
rule
is
intended
to
prevent
we
must
therefore
proceed
by
general
rules
and
regulate
ourselves
by
general
interests
in
modifying
the
law
of
nature
concerning
the
stability
of
possession
nor
need
we
fear
that
our
attachment
to
this
law
will
diminish
upon
account
of
the
seeming
frivolousness
of
those
interests
by
which
it
is
determined
the
impulse
of
the
mind
is
derived
from
a
very
strong
interest
and
those
other
more
minute
interests
serve
only
to
direct
the
motion
without
adding
any
thing
to
it
or
diminishing
from
it
it
is
the
same
case
with
government
nothing
is
more
advantageous
to
society
than
such
an
invention
and
this
interest
is
sufficient
to
make
us
embrace
it
with
ardour
and
alacrity
though
we
are
obliged
afterwards
to
regulate
and
direct
our
devotion
to
government
by
several
considerations
which
are
not
of
the
same
importance
and
to
chuse
our
magistrates
without
having
in
view
any
particular
advantage
from
the
choice
the
first
of
those
principles
i
shall
take
notice
of
as
a
foundation
of
the
right
of
magistracy
is
that
which
gives
authority
to
all
the
most
established
governments
of
the
world
without
exception
i
mean
long
possession
in
any
one
form
of
government
or
succession
of
princes
it
is
certain
that
if
we
remount
to
the
first
origin
of
every
nation
we
shall
find
that
there
scarce
is
any
race
of
kings
or
form
of
a
commonwealth
that
is
not
primarily
founded
on
usurpation
and
rebellion
and
whose
title
is
not
at
first
worse
than
doubtful
and
uncertain
time
alone
gives
solidity
to
their
right
and
operating
gradually
on
the
minds
of
men
reconciles
them
to
any
authority
and
makes
it
seem
just
and
reasonable
nothing
causes
any
sentiment
to
have
a
greater
influence
upon
us
than
custom
or
turns
our
imagination
more
strongly
to
any
object
when
we
have
been
long
accustomed
to
obey
any
set
of
men
that
general
instinct
or
tendency
which
we
have
to
suppose
a
moral
obligation
attending
loyalty
takes
easily
this
direction
and
chuses
that
set
of
men
for
its
objects
it
is
interest
which
gives
the
general
instinct
but
it
is
custom
which
gives
the
particular
direction
and
here
it
is
observable
that
the
same
length
of
time
has
a
different
influence
on
our
sentiments
of
morality
according
to
its
different
influence
on
the
mind
we
naturally
judge
of
every
thing
by
comparison
and
since
in
considering
the
fate
of
kingdoms
and
republics
we
embrace
a
long
extent
of
time
a
small
duration
has
not
in
this
case
a
like
influence
on
our
sentiments
as
when
we
consider
any
other
object
one
thinks
he
acquires
a
right
to
a
horse
or
a
suit
of
cloaths
in
a
very
short
time
but
a
century
is
scarce
sufficient
to
establish
any
new
government
or
remove
all
scruples
in
the
minds
of
the
subjects
concerning
it
add
to
this
that
a
shorter
period
of
time
will
suffice
to
give
a
prince
a
title
to
any
additional
power
he
may
usurp
than
will
serve
to
fix
his
right
where
the
whole
is
an
usurpation
the
kings
of
france
have
not
been
possessed
of
absolute
power
for
above
two
reigns
and
yet
nothing
will
appear
more
extravagant
to
frenchmen
than
to
talk
of
their
liberties
if
we
consider
what
has
been
said
concerning
accession
we
shall
easily
account
for
this
phaenomenon
when
there
is
no
form
of
government
established
by
long
possession
the
present
possession
is
sufficient
to
supply
its
place
and
may
be
regarded
as
the
second
source
of
all
public
authority
right
to
authority
is
nothing
but
the
constant
possession
of
authority
maintained
by
the
laws
of
society
and
the
interests
of
mankind
and
nothing
can
be
more
natural
than
to
join
this
constant
possession
to
the
present
one
according
to
the
principles
if
the
same
principles
did
not
take
place
with
regard
to
the
property
of
private
persons
it
was
because
these
principles
were
by
very
strong
considerations
of
interest
when
we
observed
that
all
restitution
would
by
that
means
be
prevented
and
every
violence
be
authorized
and
protected
and
though
the
same
motives
may
seem
to
have
force
with
regard
to
public
authority
yet
they
are
opposed
by
a
contrary
interest
which
consists
in
the
preservation
of
peace
and
the
avoiding
of
all
changes
which
however
they
may
be
easily
produced
in
private
affairs
are
unavoidably
attended
with
bloodshed
and
confusion
where
the
public
is
interested
any
one
who
finding
the
impossibility
of
accounting
for
the
right
of
the
present
possessor
by
any
received
system
of
ethics
should
resolve
to
deny
absolutely
that
right
and
assert
that
it
is
not
authorized
by
morality
would
be
justly
thought
to
maintain
a
very
extravagant
paradox
and
to
shock
the
common
sense
and
judgment
of
mankind
no
maxim
is
more
conformable
both
to
prudence
and
morals
than
to
submit
quietly
to
the
government
which
we
find
established
in
the
country
where
we
happen
to
live
without
enquiring
too
curiously
into
its
origin
and
first
establishment
few
governments
will
bear
being
examined
so
rigorously
how
many
kingdoms
are
there
at
present
in
the
world
and
how
many
more
do
we
find
in
history
whose
governors
have
no
better
foundation
for
their
authority
than
that
of
present
possession
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
roman
and
grecian
empire
is
it
not
evident
that
the
long
succession
of
emperors
from
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
liberty
to
the
final
extinction
of
that
empire
by
the
turks
coued
not
so
much
as
pretend
to
any
other
title
to
the
empire
the
election
of
the
senate
was
a
mere
form
which
always
followed
the
choice
of
the
legions
and
these
were
almost
always
divided
in
the
different
provinces
and
nothing
but
the
sword
was
able
to
terminate
the
difference
it
was
by
the
sword
therefore
that
every
emperor
acquired
as
well
as
defended
his
right
and
we
must
either
say
that
all
the
known
world
for
so
many
ages
had
no
government
and
owed
no
allegiance
to
any
one
or
must
allow
that
the
right
of
the
stronger
in
public
affairs
is
to
be
received
as
legitimate
and
authorized
by
morality
when
not
opposed
by
any
other
title
the
right
of
conquest
may
be
considered
as
a
third
source
of
the
title
of
sovereigns
this
right
resembles
very
much
that
of
present
possession
but
has
rather
a
superior
force
being
seconded
by
the
notions
of
glory
and
honour
which
we
ascribe
to
conquerors
instead
of
the
sentiments
of
hatred
and
detestation
which
attend
usurpers
men
naturally
favour
those
they
love
and
therefore
are
more
apt
to
ascribe
a
right
to
successful
violence
betwixt
one
sovereign
and
another
than
to
the
successful
rebellion
of
a
subject
against
his
sovereign
footnote
it
is
not
here
asserted
that
present
possession
or
conquest
are
sufficient
to
give
a
title
against
long
possession
and
positive
laws
but
only
that
they
have
some
force
and
will
be
able
to
call
the
ballance
where
the
titles
are
otherwise
equal
and
will
even
be
sufficient
sometimes
to
sanctify
the
weaker
title
what
degree
of
force
they
have
is
difficult
to
determine
i
believe
all
moderate
men
will
allow
that
they
have
great
force
in
all
disputes
concerning
the
rights
of
princes
when
neither
long
possession
nor
present
possession
nor
conquest
take
place
as
when
the
first
sovereign
who
founded
any
monarchy
dies
in
that
case
the
right
of
succession
naturally
prevails
in
their
stead
and
men
are
commonly
induced
to
place
the
son
of
their
late
monarch
on
the
throne
and
suppose
him
to
inherit
his
father
authority
the
presumed
consent
of
the
father
the
imitation
of
the
succession
to
private
families
the
interest
which
the
state
has
in
chusing
the
person
who
is
most
powerful
and
has
the
most
numerous
followers
all
these
reasons
lead
men
to
prefer
the
son
of
their
late
monarch
to
any
other
person
footnote
to
prevent
mistakes
i
must
observe
that
this
case
of
succession
is
not
the
same
with
that
of
hereditary
monarchies
where
custom
has
fix
the
right
of
succession
these
depend
upon
the
principle
of
long
possession
above
explain
these
reasons
have
some
weight
but
i
am
persuaded
that
to
one
who
considers
impartially
of
the
matter
it
will
appear
that
there
concur
some
principles
of
the
imagination
along
with
those
views
of
interest
the
royal
authority
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
young
prince
even
in
his
father
by
the
natural
transition
of
the
thought
and
still
more
after
his
death
so
that
nothing
is
more
natural
than
to
compleat
this
union
by
a
new
relation
and
by
putting
him
actually
in
possession
of
what
seems
so
naturally
to
belong
to
him
to
confirm
this
we
may
weigh
the
following
phaenomena
which
are
pretty
curious
in
their
kind
in
elective
monarchies
the
right
of
succession
has
no
place
by
the
laws
and
settled
custom
and
yet
its
influence
is
so
natural
that
it
is
impossible
entirely
to
exclude
it
from
the
imagination
and
render
the
subjects
indifferent
to
the
son
of
their
deceased
monarch
hence
in
some
governments
of
this
kind
the
choice
commonly
falls
on
one
or
other
of
the
royal
family
and
in
some
governments
they
are
all
excluded
those
contrary
phaenomena
proceed
from
the
same
principle
where
the
royal
family
is
excluded
it
is
from
a
refinement
in
politics
which
makes
people
sensible
of
their
propensity
to
chuse
a
sovereign
in
that
family
and
gives
them
a
jealousy
of
their
liberty
lest
their
new
monarch
aided
by
this
propensity
should
establish
his
family
and
destroy
the
freedom
of
elections
for
the
future
the
history
of
artaxerxes
and
the
younger
cyrus
may
furnish
us
with
some
reflections
to
the
same
purpose
cyrus
pretended
a
right
to
the
throne
above
his
elder
brother
because
he
was
born
after
his
accession
i
do
not
pretend
that
this
reason
was
valid
i
would
only
infer
from
it
that
he
would
never
have
made
use
of
such
a
pretext
were
it
not
for
the
qualities
of
the
imagination
by
which
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
unite
by
a
new
relation
whatever
objects
we
find
already
united
artaxerxes
had
an
advantage
above
his
brother
as
being
the
eldest
son
and
the
first
in
succession
but
cyrus
was
more
closely
related
to
the
royal
authority
as
being
begot
after
his
father
was
invested
with
it
should
it
here
be
pretended
that
the
view
of
convenience
may
be
the
source
of
all
the
right
of
succession
and
that
men
gladly
take
advantage
of
any
rule
by
which
they
can
fix
the
successor
of
their
late
sovereign
and
prevent
that
anarchy
and
confusion
which
attends
all
new
elections
to
this
i
would
answer
that
i
readily
allow
that
this
motive
may
contribute
something
to
the
effect
but
at
the
same
time
i
assert
that
without
another
principle
it
is
impossible
such
a
motive
should
take
place
the
interest
of
a
nation
requires
that
the
succession
to
the
crown
should
be
fixed
one
way
or
other
but
it
is
the
same
thing
to
its
interest
in
what
way
it
be
fixed
so
that
if
the
relation
of
blood
had
not
an
effect
independent
of
public
interest
it
would
never
have
been
regarded
without
a
positive
law
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
that
so
many
positive
laws
of
different
nations
coued
ever
have
concured
precisely
in
the
same
views
and
intentions
this
leads
us
to
consider
the
fifth
source
of
authority
viz
positive
laws
when
the
legislature
establishes
a
certain
form
of
government
and
succession
of
princes
at
first
sight
it
may
be
thought
that
this
must
resolve
into
some
of
the
preceding
titles
of
authority
the
legislative
power
whence
the
positive
law
is
derived
must
either
be
established
by
original
contract
long
possession
present
possession
conquest
or
succession
and
consequently
the
positive
law
must
derive
its
force
from
some
of
those
principles
but
here
it
is
remarkable
that
though
a
positive
law
can
only
derive
its
force
from
these
principles
yet
it
acquires
not
all
the
force
of
the
principle
from
whence
it
is
derived
but
loses
considerably
in
the
transition
as
it
is
natural
to
imagine
for
instance
a
government
is
established
for
many
centuries
on
a
certain
system
of
laws
forms
and
methods
of
succession
the
legislative
power
established
by
this
long
succession
changes
all
on
a
sudden
the
whole
system
of
government
and
introduces
a
new
constitution
in
its
stead
i
believe
few
of
the
subjects
will
think
themselves
bound
to
comply
with
this
alteration
unless
it
have
an
evident
tendency
to
the
public
good
but
men
think
themselves
still
at
liberty
to
return
to
the
antient
government
hence
the
notion
of
fundamental
laws
which
are
supposed
to
be
inalterable
by
the
will
of
the
sovereign
and
of
this
nature
the
salic
law
is
understood
to
be
in
france
how
far
these
fundamental
laws
extend
is
not
determined
in
any
government
nor
is
it
possible
it
ever
should
there
is
such
an
indefensible
gradation
from
the
most
material
laws
to
the
most
trivial
and
from
the
most
antient
laws
to
the
most
modem
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
set
bounds
to
the
legislative
power
and
determine
how
far
it
may
innovate
in
the
principles
of
government
that
is
the
work
more
of
imagination
and
passion
than
of
reason
whoever
considers
the
history
of
the
several
nations
of
the
world
their
revolutions
conquests
increase
and
diminution
the
manner
in
which
their
particular
governments
are
established
and
the
successive
right
transmitted
from
one
person
to
another
will
soon
learn
to
treat
very
lightly
all
disputes
concerning
the
rights
of
princes
and
will
be
convinced
that
a
strict
adherence
to
any
general
rules
and
the
rigid
loyalty
to
particular
persons
and
families
on
which
some
people
set
so
high
a
value
are
virtues
that
hold
less
of
reason
than
of
bigotry
and
superstition
in
this
particular
the
study
of
history
confirms
the
reasonings
of
true
philosophy
which
shewing
us
the
original
qualities
of
human
nature
teaches
us
to
regard
the
controversies
in
politics
as
incapable
of
any
decision
in
most
cases
and
as
entirely
subordinate
to
the
interests
of
peace
and
liberty
where
the
public
good
does
not
evidently
demand
a
change
it
is
certain
that
the
concurrence
of
all
those
titles
original
contract
long
possession
present
possession
succession
and
positive
laws
forms
the
strongest
title
to
sovereignty
and
is
justly
regarded
as
sacred
and
inviolable
but
when
these
titles
are
mingled
and
opposed
in
different
degrees
they
often
occasion
perplexity
and
are
less
capable
of
solution
from
the
arguments
of
lawyers
and
philosophers
than
from
the
swords
of
the
soldiery
who
shall
tell
me
for
instance
whether
germanicus
or
drufus
ought
to
have
succeeded
tiberius
had
he
died
while
they
were
both
alive
without
naming
any
of
them
for
his
successor
ought
the
right
of
adoption
to
be
received
as
equivalent
to
that
of
blood
in
a
nation
where
it
had
the
same
effect
in
private
families
and
had
already
in
two
instances
taken
place
in
the
public
ought
germanicus
to
be
esteemed
the
eldest
son
because
he
was
born
before
drufus
or
the
younger
because
he
was
adopted
after
the
birth
of
his
brother
ought
the
right
of
the
elder
to
be
regarded
in
a
nation
where
the
eldest
brother
had
no
advantage
in
the
succession
to
private
families
ought
the
roman
empire
at
that
time
to
be
esteemed
hereditary
because
of
two
examples
or
ought
it
even
so
early
to
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
stronger
or
the
present
possessor
as
being
founded
on
so
recent
an
usurpation
upon
whatever
principles
we
may
pretend
to
answer
these
and
such
like
questions
i
am
afraid
we
shall
never
be
able
to
satisfy
an
impartial
enquirer
who
adopts
no
party
in
political
controversies
and
will
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
sound
reason
and
philosophy
but
here
an
english
reader
will
be
apt
to
enquire
concerning
that
famous
revolution
which
has
had
such
a
happy
influence
on
our
constitution
and
has
been
attended
with
such
mighty
consequences
we
have
already
remarked
that
in
the
case
of
enormous
tyranny
and
oppression
it
is
lawful
to
take
arms
even
against
supreme
power
and
that
as
government
is
a
mere
human
invention
for
mutual
advantage
and
security
it
no
longer
imposes
any
obligation
either
natural
or
moral
when
once
it
ceases
to
have
that
tendency
but
though
this
general
principle
be
authorized
by
common
sense
and
the
practice
of
all
ages
it
is
certainly
impossible
for
the
laws
or
even
for
philosophy
to
establish
any
particular
rules
by
which
we
may
know
when
resistance
is
lawful
and
decide
all
controversies
which
may
arise
on
that
subject
this
may
not
only
happen
with
regard
to
supreme
power
but
it
is
possible
even
in
some
constitutions
where
the
legislative
authority
is
not
lodged
in
one
person
that
there
may
be
a
magistrate
so
eminent
and
powerful
as
to
oblige
the
laws
to
keep
silence
in
this
particular
nor
would
this
silence
be
an
effect
only
of
their
respect
but
also
of
their
prudence
since
it
is
certain
that
in
the
vast
variety
of
circumstances
which
occur
in
all
governments
an
exercise
of
power
in
so
great
a
magistrate
may
at
one
time
be
beneficial
to
the
public
which
at
another
time
would
be
pernicious
and
tyrannical
but
notwithstanding
this
silence
of
the
laws
in
limited
monarchies
it
is
certain
that
the
people
still
retain
the
right
of
resistance
since
it
is
impossible
even
in
the
most
despotic
governments
to
deprive
them
of
it
the
same
necessity
of
and
the
same
motive
of
public
good
give
them
the
same
liberty
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
and
we
may
farther
observe
that
in
such
mixed
governments
the
cases
wherein
resistance
is
lawful
must
occur
much
oftener
and
greater
indulgence
be
given
to
the
subjects
to
defend
themselves
by
force
of
arms
than
in
arbitrary
governments
not
only
where
the
chief
magistrate
enters
into
measures
in
themselves
extremely
pernicious
to
the
public
but
even
when
he
would
encroach
on
the
other
parts
of
the
constitution
and
extend
his
power
beyond
the
legal
bounds
it
is
allowable
to
resist
and
dethrone
him
though
such
resistance
and
violence
may
in
the
general
tenor
of
the
laws
be
deemed
unlawful
and
rebellious
for
besides
that
nothing
is
more
essential
to
public
interest
than
the
preservation
of
public
liberty
it
is
evident
that
if
such
a
mixed
government
be
once
supposed
to
be
established
every
part
or
member
of
the
constitution
must
have
a
right
of
and
of
maintaining
its
antient
bounds
against
the
enaoachment
of
every
other
authority
as
matter
would
have
been
created
in
vain
were
it
deprived
of
a
power
of
resistance
without
which
no
part
of
it
coued
preserve
a
distinct
existence
and
the
whole
might
be
crowded
up
into
a
single
point
so
it
is
a
gross
absurdity
to
suppose
in
any
government
a
right
without
a
remedy
or
allow
that
the
supreme
power
is
shared
with
the
people
without
allowing
that
it
is
lawful
for
them
to
defend
their
share
against
every
invader
those
therefore
who
would
seem
to
respect
our
free
government
and
yet
deny
the
right
of
resistance
have
renounced
all
pretensions
to
common
sense
and
do
not
merit
a
serious
answer
it
does
not
belong
to
my
present
purpose
to
shew
that
these
general
principles
are
applicable
to
the
late
revolution
and
that
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
ought
to
be
sacred
to
a
free
nation
were
at
that
time
threatened
with
the
utmost
danger
i
am
better
pleased
to
leave
this
controverted
subject
if
it
really
admits
of
controversy
and
to
indulge
myself
in
some
philosophical
reflections
which
naturally
arise
from
that
important
event
first
we
may
observe
that
should
the
lords
and
commons
in
our
constitution
without
any
reason
from
public
interest
either
depose
the
king
in
being
or
after
his
death
exclude
the
prince
who
by
laws
and
settled
custom
ought
to
succeed
no
one
would
esteem
their
proceedings
legal
or
think
themselves
bound
to
comply
with
them
but
should
the
king
by
his
unjust
practices
or
his
attempts
for
a
tyrannical
and
despotic
power
justly
forfeit
his
legal
it
then
not
only
becomes
morally
lawful
and
suitable
to
the
nature
of
political
society
to
dethrone
him
but
what
is
more
we
are
apt
likewise
to
think
that
the
remaining
members
of
the
constitution
acquire
a
right
of
excluding
his
next
heir
and
of
chusing
whom
they
please
for
his
successor
this
is
founded
on
a
very
singular
quality
of
our
thought
and
imagination
when
a
king
forfeits
his
authority
his
heir
ought
naturally
to
remain
in
the
same
situation
as
if
the
king
were
removed
by
death
unless
by
mixing
himself
in
the
tyranny
he
forfeit
it
for
himself
but
though
this
may
seem
reasonable
we
easily
comply
with
the
contrary
opinion
the
deposition
of
a
king
in
such
a
government
as
ours
is
certainly
an
act
beyond
all
common
authority
and
an
illegal
assuming
a
power
for
public
good
which
in
the
ordinary
course
of
government
can
belong
to
no
member
of
the
constitution
when
the
public
good
is
so
great
and
so
evident
as
to
justify
the
action
the
commendable
use
of
this
licence
causes
us
naturally
to
attribute
to
the
parliament
a
right
of
using
farther
licences
and
the
antient
bounds
of
the
laws
being
once
transgressed
with
approbation
we
are
not
apt
to
be
so
strict
in
confining
ourselves
precisely
within
their
limits
the
mind
naturally
runs
on
with
any
train
of
action
which
it
has
begun
nor
do
we
commonly
make
any
scruple
concerning
our
duty
after
the
first
action
of
any
kind
which
we
perform
thus
at
the
revolution
no
one
who
thought
the
deposition
of
the
father
justifiable
esteemed
themselves
to
be
confined
to
his
infant
son
though
had
that
unhappy
monarch
died
innocent
at
that
time
and
had
his
son
by
any
accident
been
conveyed
beyond
seas
there
is
no
doubt
but
a
regency
would
have
been
appointed
till
he
should
come
to
age
and
coued
be
restored
to
his
dominions
as
the
slightest
properties
of
the
imagination
have
an
effect
on
the
judgments
of
the
people
it
shews
the
wisdom
of
the
laws
and
of
the
parliament
to
take
advantage
of
such
properties
and
to
chuse
the
magistrates
either
in
or
out
of
a
line
according
as
the
vulgar
will
most
naturally
attribute
authority
and
right
to
them
secondly
though
the
accession
of
the
prince
of
orange
to
the
throne
might
at
first
give
occasion
to
many
disputes
and
his
title
be
contested
it
ought
not
now
to
appear
doubtful
but
must
have
acquired
a
sufficient
authority
from
those
three
princes
who
have
succeeded
him
upon
the
same
title
nothing
is
more
usual
though
nothing
may
at
first
sight
appear
more
unreasonable
than
this
way
of
thinking
princes
often
seem
to
acquire
a
right
from
their
successors
as
well
as
from
their
ancestors
and
a
king
who
during
his
might
justly
be
deemed
an
usurper
will
be
regarded
by
posterity
as
a
lawful
prince
because
he
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
settle
his
family
on
the
throne
and
entirely
change
the
antient
form
of
government
julius
caesar
is
regarded
as
the
first
roman
emperor
while
sylla
and
marius
whose
titles
were
really
the
same
as
his
are
treated
as
tyrants
and
usurpers
time
and
custom
give
authority
to
all
forms
of
government
and
all
successions
of
princes
and
that
power
which
at
first
was
founded
only
on
injustice
and
violence
becomes
in
time
legal
and
obligatory
nor
does
the
mind
rest
there
but
returning
back
upon
its
footsteps
transfers
to
their
predecessors
and
ancestors
that
right
which
it
naturally
ascribes
to
the
posterity
as
being
related
together
and
united
in
the
imagination
the
present
king
of
france
makes
hugh
capet
a
more
lawful
prince
than
cromwell
as
the
established
liberty
of
the
dutch
is
no
inconsiderable
apology
for
their
obstinate
resistance
to
philip
the
second
sect
xi
of
the
laws
of
nations
when
civil
government
has
been
established
over
the
greatest
part
of
mankind
and
different
societies
have
been
formed
contiguous
to
each
other
there
arises
a
new
set
of
duties
among
the
neighbouring
states
suitable
to
the
nature
of
that
commerce
which
they
carry
on
with
each
other
political
writers
tell
us
that
in
every
kind
of
intercourse
a
body
politic
is
to
be
considered
as
one
person
and
indeed
this
assertion
is
so
far
just
that
different
nations
as
well
as
private
persons
require
mutual
assistance
at
the
same
time
that
their
selfishness
and
ambition
are
perpetual
sources
of
war
and
discord
but
though
nations
in
this
particular
resemble
individuals
yet
as
they
are
very
different
in
other
respects
no
wonder
they
regulate
themselves
by
different
maxims
and
give
rise
to
a
new
set
of
rules
which
we
call
the
laws
of
nations
under
this
head
we
may
comprize
the
sacredness
of
the
persons
of
ambassadors
the
declaration
of
war
the
abstaining
from
poisoned
arms
with
other
duties
of
that
kind
which
are
evidently
calculated
for
the
commerce
that
is
peculiar
to
different
societies
but
though
these
rules
be
to
the
laws
of
nature
the
former
do
not
entirely
abolish
the
latter
and
one
may
safely
affirm
that
the
three
fundamental
rules
of
justice
the
stability
of
possession
its
transference
by
consent
and
the
performance
of
promises
are
duties
of
princes
as
well
as
of
subjects
the
same
interest
produces
the
same
effect
in
both
cases
where
possession
has
no
stability
there
must
be
perpetual
war
where
property
is
not
transferred
by
consent
there
can
be
no
commerce
where
promises
are
not
observed
there
can
be
no
leagues
nor
alliances
the
advantages
therefore
of
peace
commerce
and
mutual
succour
make
us
extend
to
different
kingdoms
the
same
notions
of
justice
which
take
place
among
individuals
there
is
a
maxim
very
current
in
the
world
which
few
politicians
are
willing
to
avow
but
which
has
been
authorized
by
the
practice
of
all
ages
that
there
is
a
system
of
morals
cakulated
for
princes
much
more
free
than
that
which
ought
to
govern
private
parsons
it
is
evident
this
is
not
to
be
understood
of
the
lesser
extent
of
public
duties
and
obligations
nor
will
any
one
be
so
extravagant
as
to
assert
that
the
most
solemn
treaties
ought
to
have
no
force
among
princes
for
as
princes
do
actually
form
treaties
among
themselves
they
must
propose
some
advantage
from
the
execution
of
them
and
the
prospect
of
such
advantage
for
the
future
must
engage
them
to
perform
their
part
and
must
establish
that
law
of
nature
the
meaning
therefore
of
this
political
maxim
is
that
though
the
morality
of
princes
has
the
same
extent
yet
it
has
not
the
same
force
as
that
of
private
persons
and
may
lawfully
be
trangressed
from
a
more
trivial
motive
however
shocking
such
a
proposition
may
appear
to
certain
philosophers
it
will
be
easy
to
defend
it
upon
those
principles
by
which
we
have
accounted
for
the
origin
of
justice
and
equity
when
men
have
found
by
experience
that
it
is
impossible
to
subsist
without
society
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
society
while
they
give
free
course
to
their
appetites
so
urgent
an
interest
quickly
restrains
their
actions
and
imposes
an
obligation
to
observe
those
rules
which
we
call
the
laws
of
justice
this
obligation
of
interest
rests
nor
here
but
by
the
necessary
course
of
the
passions
and
sentiments
gives
rise
to
the
moral
obligation
of
duty
while
we
approve
of
such
actions
as
tend
to
the
peace
of
society
and
disapprove
of
such
as
tend
to
its
disturbance
the
same
natural
obligation
of
interest
takes
place
among
independent
kingdoms
and
gives
rise
to
the
same
morality
so
that
no
one
of
ever
so
corrupt
morals
will
approve
of
a
prince
who
voluntarily
and
of
his
own
accord
breaks
his
word
or
violates
any
treaty
but
here
we
may
observe
that
though
the
intercourse
of
different
states
be
advantageous
and
even
sometimes
necessary
yet
it
is
nor
so
necessary
nor
advantageous
as
that
among
individuals
without
which
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
human
nature
ever
to
subsist
since
therefore
the
natural
obligation
to
justice
among
different
states
is
not
so
strong
as
among
individuals
the
moral
obligation
which
arises
from
it
must
partake
of
its
weakness
and
we
must
necessarily
give
a
greater
indulgence
to
a
prince
or
minister
who
deceives
another
than
to
a
private
gentleman
who
breaks
his
word
of
honour
should
it
be
asked
what
proportion
these
two
species
of
morality
bear
to
each
other
i
would
answer
that
this
is
a
question
to
which
we
can
never
give
any
precise
answer
nor
is
it
possible
to
reduce
to
numbers
the
proportion
which
we
ought
to
fix
betwixt
them
one
may
safely
affirm
that
this
proportion
finds
itself
without
any
art
or
study
of
men
as
we
may
observe
on
many
other
occasions
the
practice
of
the
world
goes
farther
in
teaching
us
the
degrees
of
our
duty
than
the
most
subtile
philosophy
which
was
ever
yet
invented
and
this
may
serve
as
a
convincing
proof
that
all
men
have
an
implicit
notion
of
the
foundation
of
those
moral
rules
concerning
natural
and
civil
justice
and
are
sensible
that
they
arise
merely
from
human
conventions
and
from
the
interest
which
we
have
in
the
preservation
of
peace
and
order
for
otherwise
the
diminution
of
the
interest
would
never
produce
a
relaxation
of
the
morality
and
reconcile
us
more
easily
to
any
transgression
of
justice
among
princes
and
republics
than
in
the
private
commerce
of
one
subject
with
another
sect
xii
of
chastity
and
modesty
if
any
difficulty
attend
this
system
concerning
the
laws
of
nature
and
nations
it
will
be
with
regard
to
the
universal
approbation
or
blame
which
follows
their
observance
or
transgression
and
which
some
may
not
think
sufficiently
explained
from
the
general
interests
of
society
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
all
scruples
of
this
kind
i
shall
here
consider
another
set
of
duties
viz
the
modesty
and
chastity
which
belong
to
the
fair
sex
and
i
doubt
not
but
these
virtues
will
be
found
to
be
still
more
conspicuous
instances
of
the
operation
of
those
principles
which
i
have
insisted
on
there
are
some
philosophers
who
attack
the
female
virtues
with
great
vehemence
and
fancy
they
have
gone
very
far
in
detecting
popular
errors
when
they
can
show
that
there
is
no
foundation
in
nature
for
all
that
exterior
modesty
which
we
require
in
the
expressions
and
dress
and
behaviour
of
the
fair
sex
i
believe
i
may
spare
myself
the
trouble
of
insisting
on
so
obvious
a
subject
and
may
proceed
without
farther
preparation
to
examine
after
what
manner
such
notions
arise
from
education
from
the
voluntary
conventions
of
men
and
from
the
interest
of
society
whoever
considers
the
length
and
feebleness
of
human
infancy
with
the
concern
which
both
sexes
naturally
have
for
their
offspring
will
easily
perceive
that
there
must
be
an
union
of
male
and
female
for
the
education
of
the
young
and
that
this
union
must
be
of
considerable
duration
but
in
order
to
induce
the
men
to
impose
on
themselves
this
restraint
and
undergo
chearfully
all
the
fatigues
and
expences
to
which
it
subjects
them
they
must
believe
that
the
children
are
their
own
and
that
their
natural
instinct
is
not
directed
to
a
wrong
object
when
they
give
a
loose
to
love
and
tenderness
now
if
we
examine
the
structure
of
the
human
body
we
shall
find
that
this
security
is
very
difficult
to
be
attained
on
our
part
and
that
since
in
the
copulation
of
the
sexes
the
principle
of
generation
goes
from
the
man
to
the
woman
an
error
may
easily
take
place
on
the
side
of
the
former
though
it
be
utterly
impossible
with
regard
to
the
latter
from
this
trivial
and
anatomical
observation
is
derived
that
vast
difference
betwixt
the
education
and
duties
of
the
two
sexes
were
a
philosopher
to
examine
the
matter
a
priori
he
would
reason
after
the
following
manner
men
are
induced
to
labour
for
the
maintenance
and
education
of
their
children
by
the
persuasion
that
they
are
really
their
own
and
therefore
it
is
reasonable
and
even
necessary
to
give
them
some
security
in
this
particular
this
security
can
not
consist
entirely
in
the
imposing
of
severe
punishments
on
any
transgressions
of
conjugal
fidelity
on
the
part
of
the
wife
since
these
public
punishments
can
not
be
inflicted
without
legal
proof
which
it
is
difficult
to
meet
with
in
this
subject
what
restraint
therefore
shall
we
impose
on
women
in
order
to
so
strong
a
temptation
as
they
have
to
infidelity
there
seems
to
be
no
restraint
possible
but
in
the
punishment
of
bad
fame
or
reputation
a
punishment
which
has
a
mighty
influence
on
the
human
mind
and
at
the
same
time
is
inflicted
by
the
world
upon
surmizes
and
conjectures
and
proofs
that
would
never
be
received
in
any
court
of
judicature
in
order
therefore
to
impose
a
due
restraint
on
the
female
sex
we
must
attach
a
peculiar
degree
of
shame
to
their
infidelity
above
what
arises
merely
from
its
injustice
and
must
bestow
proportionable
praises
on
their
chastity
but
though
this
be
a
very
strong
motive
to
fidelity
our
philosopher
would
quickly
discover
that
it
would
not
alone
be
sufficient
to
that
purpose
all
human
creatures
especially
of
the
female
sex
are
apt
to
remote
motives
in
favour
of
any
present
temptation
the
temptation
is
here
the
strongest
imaginable
its
approaches
are
insensible
and
seducing
and
a
woman
easily
finds
or
flatters
herself
she
shall
find
certain
means
of
securing
her
reputation
and
preventing
all
the
pernicious
consequences
of
her
pleasures
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
beside
the
infamy
attending
such
licences
there
should
be
some
preceding
backwardness
or
dread
which
may
prevent
their
first
approaches
and
may
give
the
female
sex
a
repugnance
to
all
expressions
and
postures
and
liberties
that
have
an
immediate
relation
to
that
enjoyment
such
would
be
the
reasonings
of
our
speculative
philosopher
but
i
am
persuaded
that
if
he
had
not
a
perfect
knowledge
of
human
nature
he
would
be
apt
to
regard
them
as
mere
chimerical
speculations
and
would
consider
the
infamy
attending
infidelity
and
backwardness
to
all
its
approaches
as
principles
that
were
rather
to
be
wished
than
hoped
for
in
the
world
for
what
means
would
he
say
of
persuading
mankind
that
the
transgressions
of
conjugal
duty
are
more
infamous
than
any
other
kind
of
injustice
when
it
is
evident
they
are
more
excusable
upon
account
of
the
greatness
of
the
temptation
and
what
possibility
of
giving
a
backwardness
to
the
approaches
of
a
pleasure
to
which
nature
has
inspired
so
strong
a
propensity
and
a
propensity
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
in
the
end
to
comply
with
for
the
support
of
the
species
but
speculative
reasonings
which
cost
so
much
pains
to
philosophers
are
often
formed
by
the
world
naturally
and
without
reflection
as
difficulties
which
seem
unsurmountable
in
theory
are
easily
got
over
in
practice
those
who
have
an
interest
in
the
fidelity
of
women
naturally
disapprove
of
their
infidelity
and
all
the
approaches
to
it
those
who
have
no
interest
are
carried
along
with
the
stream
education
takes
possession
of
the
ductile
minds
of
the
fair
sex
in
their
infancy
and
when
a
general
rule
of
this
kind
is
once
established
men
are
apt
to
extend
it
beyond
those
principles
from
which
it
first
arose
thus
batchelors
however
debauched
can
not
chuse
but
be
shocked
with
any
instance
of
lewdness
or
impudence
in
women
and
though
all
these
maxims
have
a
plain
reference
to
generation
yet
women
past
have
no
more
privilege
in
this
respect
than
those
who
are
in
the
flower
of
their
youth
and
beauty
men
have
undoubtedly
an
implicit
notion
that
all
those
ideas
of
modesty
and
decency
have
a
regard
to
generation
since
they
impose
not
the
same
laws
with
the
same
force
on
the
male
sex
where
that
reason
takes
nor
place
the
exception
is
there
obvious
and
extensive
and
founded
on
a
remarkable
difference
which
produces
a
clear
separation
and
disjunction
of
ideas
but
as
the
case
is
not
the
same
with
regard
to
the
different
ages
of
women
for
this
reason
though
men
know
that
these
notions
are
founded
on
the
public
interest
yet
the
general
rule
carries
us
beyond
the
original
principle
and
makes
us
extend
the
notions
of
modesty
over
the
whole
sex
from
their
earliest
infancy
to
their
extremest
and
infirmity
courage
which
is
the
point
of
honour
among
men
derives
its
merit
in
a
great
measure
from
artifice
as
well
as
the
chastity
of
women
though
it
has
also
some
foundation
in
nature
as
we
shall
see
afterwards
as
to
the
obligations
which
the
male
sex
lie
under
with
regard
to
chastity
we
may
observe
that
according
to
the
general
notions
of
the
world
they
bear
nearly
the
same
proportion
to
the
obligations
of
women
as
the
obligations
of
the
law
of
nations
do
to
those
of
the
law
of
nature
it
is
contrary
to
the
interest
of
civil
society
that
men
should
have
an
entire
liberty
of
indulging
their
appetites
in
venereal
enjoyment
but
as
this
interest
is
weaker
than
in
the
case
of
the
female
sex
the
moral
obligation
arising
from
it
must
be
proportionably
weaker
and
to
prove
this
we
need
only
appeal
to
the
practice
and
sentiments
of
all
nations
and
ages
part
iii
of
the
other
virtues
and
vices
sect
i
of
the
origin
of
the
natural
virtues
and
vices
we
come
now
to
the
examination
of
such
virtues
and
vices
as
are
entirely
natural
and
have
no
dependance
on
the
artifice
and
contrivance
of
men
the
examination
of
these
will
conclude
this
system
of
morals
the
chief
spring
or
actuating
principle
of
the
human
mind
is
pleasure
or
pain
and
when
these
sensations
are
removed
both
from
our
thought
and
feeling
we
are
in
a
great
measure
incapable
of
passion
or
action
of
desire
or
volition
the
most
immediate
effects
of
pleasure
and
pain
are
the
propense
and
averse
motions
of
the
mind
which
are
diversified
into
volition
into
desire
and
aversion
grief
and
joy
hope
and
fear
according
as
the
pleasure
or
pain
changes
its
situation
and
becomes
probable
or
improbable
certain
or
uncertain
or
is
considered
as
out
of
our
power
for
the
present
moment
but
when
along
with
this
the
objects
that
cause
pleasure
or
pain
acquire
a
relation
to
ourselves
or
others
they
still
continue
to
excite
desire
and
aversion
grief
and
joy
but
cause
at
the
same
time
the
indirect
passions
of
pride
or
humility
love
or
hatred
which
in
this
case
have
a
double
relation
of
impressions
and
ideas
to
the
pain
or
pleasure
we
have
already
observed
that
moral
distinctions
depend
entirely
on
certain
peculiar
sentiments
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
that
whatever
mental
quality
in
ourselves
or
others
gives
us
a
satisfaction
by
the
survey
or
reflection
is
of
course
virtuous
as
every
thing
of
this
nature
that
gives
uneasiness
is
vicious
now
since
every
quality
in
ourselves
or
others
which
gives
pleasure
always
causes
pride
or
love
as
every
one
that
produces
uneasiness
excites
humility
or
hatred
it
follows
that
these
two
particulars
are
to
be
considered
as
equivalent
with
regard
to
our
mental
qualities
virtue
and
the
power
of
producing
love
or
pride
vice
and
the
power
of
producing
humility
or
hatred
in
every
case
therefore
we
must
judge
of
the
one
by
the
other
and
may
pronounce
any
quality
of
the
mind
virtuous
which
causes
love
or
pride
and
any
one
vicious
which
causes
hatred
or
humility
if
any
action
be
either
virtuous
or
vicious
it
is
only
as
a
sign
of
some
quality
or
character
it
must
depend
upon
durable
principles
of
the
mind
which
extend
over
the
whole
conduct
and
enter
into
the
personal
character
actions
themselves
not
proceeding
from
any
constant
principle
have
no
influence
on
love
or
hatred
pride
or
humility
and
consequently
are
never
considered
in
morality
this
reflection
is
and
deserves
to
be
attended
to
as
being
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
present
subject
we
are
never
to
consider
any
single
action
in
our
enquiries
concerning
the
origin
of
morals
but
only
the
quality
or
character
from
which
the
action
proceeded
these
alone
are
durable
enough
to
affect
our
sentiments
concerning
the
person
actions
are
indeed
better
indications
of
a
character
than
words
or
even
wishes
and
sentiments
but
it
is
only
so
far
as
they
are
such
indications
that
they
are
attended
with
love
or
hatred
praise
or
blame
to
discover
the
true
origin
of
morals
and
of
that
love
or
hatred
which
arises
from
mental
qualities
we
must
take
the
matter
pretty
deep
and
compare
some
principles
which
have
been
already
examined
and
explained
we
may
begin
with
considering
the
nature
and
force
of
sympathy
the
minds
of
all
men
are
similar
in
their
feelings
and
operations
nor
can
any
one
be
actuated
by
any
affection
of
which
all
others
are
not
in
some
degree
susceptible
as
in
strings
equally
wound
up
the
motion
of
one
communicates
itself
to
the
rest
so
all
the
affections
readily
pass
from
one
person
to
another
and
beget
correspondent
movements
in
every
human
creature
when
i
see
the
effects
of
passion
in
the
voice
and
gesture
of
any
person
my
mind
immediately
passes
from
these
effects
to
their
causes
and
forms
such
a
lively
idea
of
the
passion
as
is
presently
converted
into
the
passion
itself
in
like
manner
when
i
perceive
the
causes
of
any
emotion
my
mind
is
conveyed
to
the
effects
and
is
actuated
with
a
like
emotion
were
i
present
at
any
of
the
more
terrible
operations
of
surgery
it
is
certain
that
even
before
it
begun
the
preparation
of
the
instruments
the
laying
of
the
bandages
in
order
the
heating
of
the
irons
with
all
the
signs
of
anxiety
and
concern
in
the
patient
and
assistants
would
have
a
great
effect
upon
my
mind
and
excite
the
strongest
sentiments
of
pity
and
terror
no
passion
of
another
discovers
itself
immediately
to
the
mind
we
are
only
sensible
of
its
causes
or
effects
from
these
we
infer
the
passion
and
consequently
these
give
rise
to
our
sympathy
our
sense
of
beauty
depends
very
much
on
this
principle
and
where
any
object
has
atendency
to
produce
pleasure
in
its
possessor
it
is
always
regarded
as
beautiful
as
every
object
that
has
a
tendency
to
produce
pain
is
disagreeable
and
deformed
thus
the
conveniency
of
a
house
the
fertility
of
a
field
the
strength
of
a
horse
the
capacity
security
and
of
a
vessel
form
the
principal
beauty
of
these
several
objects
here
the
object
which
is
denominated
beautiful
pleases
only
by
its
tendency
to
produce
a
certain
effect
that
effect
is
the
pleasure
or
advantage
of
some
other
person
now
the
pleasure
of
a
stranger
for
whom
we
have
no
friendship
pleases
us
only
by
sympathy
to
this
principle
therefore
is
owing
the
beauty
which
we
find
in
every
thing
that
is
useful
how
considerable
a
part
this
is
of
beauty
can
easily
appear
upon
reflection
wherever
an
object
has
a
tendency
to
produce
pleasure
in
the
possessor
or
in
other
words
is
the
proper
cause
of
pleasure
it
is
sure
to
please
the
spectator
by
a
delicate
sympathy
with
the
possessor
most
of
the
works
of
art
are
esteemed
beautiful
in
proportion
to
their
fitness
for
the
use
of
man
and
even
many
of
the
productions
of
nature
derive
their
beauty
from
that
source
handsome
and
beautiful
on
most
occasions
is
nor
an
absolute
but
a
relative
quality
and
pleases
us
by
nothing
but
its
tendency
to
produce
an
end
that
is
agreeable

to

this

the

principle
produces
in
many
instances
our
sentiments
of
morals
as
well
as
those
of

no
virtue
is
more
esteemed
than
justice
and
no
vice
more
detested
than
injustice
nor
are
there
any
qualities
which
go
farther
to
the
fixing
the
character
either
as
amiable
or
odious
now
justice
is
a
moral
virtue
merely
because
it
has
that
tendency
to
the
good
of
mankind
and
indeed
is
nothing
but
an
artificial
invention
to
that
purpose
the
same
may
be
said
of
allegiance
of
the
laws
of
nations
of
modesty
and
of
all
these
are
mere
human
contrivances
for
the
interest
of
society
and
since
there
is
a
very
strong
sentiment
of
morals
which
in
all
nations
and
all
ages
has
attended
them
we
must
allow
that
the
reflecting
on
the
tendency
of
characters
and
mental
qualities
is
sufficient
to
give
us
the
sentiments
of
approbation
and
blame
now
as
the
means
to
an
end
can
only
be
agreeable
where
the
end
is
agreeable
and
as
the
good
of
society
where
our
own
interest
is
not
concerned
or
that
of
our
friends
pleases
only
by
sympathy
it
follows
that
sympathy
is
the
source
of
the
esteem
which
we
pay
to
all
the
artificial
virtues
thus
it
appears
that
sympathy
is
a
very
powerful
principle
in
human
nature
that
it
has
a
great
influence
on
our
taste
of
beauty
and
that
it
produces
our
sentiment
of
morals
in
all
the
artificial
virtues
from
thence
we
may
presume
that
it
also
gives
rise
to
many
of
the
other
virtues
and
that
qualities
acquire
our
approbation
because
of
their
tendency
to
the
good
of
mankind
this
presumption
must
become
a
certainty
when
we
find
that
most
of
those
qualities
which
we
naturally
approve
of
have
actually
that
tendency
and
render
a
man
a
proper
member
of
society
while
the
qualities
which
we
naturally
disapprove
of
have
a
contrary
tendency
and
render
any
intercourse
with
the
person
dangerous
or
disagreeable
for
having
found
that
such
tendencies
have
force
enough
to
produce
the
strongest
sentiment
of
morals
we
can
never
reasonably
in
these
cases
look
for
any
other
cause
of
approbation
or
blame
it
being
an
inviolable
maxim
in
philosophy
that
where
any
particular
cause
is
sufficient
for
an
effect
we
ought
to
rest
satisfied
with
it
and
ought
not
to
multiply
causes
without
necessity
we
have
happily
attained
experiments
in
the
artificial
virtues
where
the
tendency
of
qualities
to
the
good
of
society
is
the
sole
cause
of
our
approbation
without
any
suspicion
of
the
concurrence
of
another
principle
from
thence
we
learn
the
force
of
that
principle
and
where
that
principle
may
take
place
and
the
quality
approved
of
is
really
beneficial
to
society
a
true
philosopher
will
never
require
any
other
principle
to
account
for
the
strongest
approbation
and
esteem
that
many
of
the
natural
virtues
have
this
tendency
to
the
good
of
society
no
one
can
doubt
of
meekness
beneficence
charity
generosity
clemency
moderation
equity
bear
the
greatest
figure
among
the
moral
qualities
and
are
commonly
denominated
the
social
virtues
to
mark
their
tendency
to
the
good
of
society
this
goes
so
far
that
some
philosophers
have
represented
all
moral
distinctions
as
the
effect
of
artifice
and
education
when
skilful
politicians
endeavoured
to
restrain
the
turbulent
passions
of
men
and
make
them
operate
to
the
public
good
by
the
notions
of
honour
and
shame
this
system
however
is
nor
consistent
with
experience
for
first
there
are
other
virtues
and
vices
beside
those
which
have
this
tendency
to
the
public
advantage
and
loss
secondly
had
not
men
a
natural
sentiment
of
approbation
and
blame
it
coued
never
be
excited
by
politicians
nor
would
the
words
laudable
and
blameable
and
odious
be
any
more
intelligible
than
if
they
were
a
language
perfectly
known
to
us
as
we
have
already
observed
but
though
this
system
be
erroneous
it
may
teach
us
that
moral
distinctions
arise
in
a
great
measure
from
the
tendency
of
qualities
and
characters
to
the
interests
of
society
and
that
it
is
our
concern
for
that
interest
which
makes
us
approve
or
disapprove
of
them
now
we
have
no
such
extensive
concern
for
society
but
from
sympathy
and
consequently
it
is
that
principle
which
takes
us
so
far
out
of
ourselves
as
to
give
us
the
same
pleasure
or
uneasiness
in
the
characters
of
others
as
if
they
had
a
tendency
to
our
own
advantage
or
loss
the
only
difference
betwixt
the
natural
virtues
and
justice
lies
in
this
that
the
good
which
results
from
the
former
arises
from
every
single
act
and
is
the
object
of
some
natural
passion
whereas
a
single
act
of
justice
considered
in
itself
may
often
be
contrary
to
the
public
good
and
it
is
only
the
concurrence
of
mankind
in
a
general
scheme
or
system
of
action
which
is
advantageous
when
i
relieve
persons
in
distress
my
natural
humanity
is
my
motive
and
so
far
as
my
succour
extends
so
far
have
i
promoted
the
happiness
of
my
but
if
we
examine
all
the
questions
that
come
before
any
tribunal
of
justice
we
shall
find
that
considering
each
case
apart
it
would
as
often
be
an
instance
of
humanity
to
decide
contrary
to
the
laws
of
justice
as
conformable
them
judges
take
from
a
poor
man
to
give
to
a
rich
they
bestow
on
the
dissolute
the
labour
of
the
industrious
and
put
into
the
hands
of
the
vicious
the
means
of
harming
both
themselves
and
others
the
whole
scheme
however
of
law
and
justice
is
advantageous
to
the
society
and
it
was
with
a
view
to
this
advantage
that
men
by
their
voluntary
conventions
established
it
after
it
is
once
established
by
these
conventions
it
is
naturally
attended
with
a
strong
sentiment
of
morals
which
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
our
sympathy
with
the
interests
of
society
we
need
no
other
explication
of
that
esteem
which
attends
such
of
the
natural
virtues
as
have
a
tendency
to
the
public
good
i
must
farther
add
that
there
are
several
circumstances
which
render
this
hypothesis
much
more
probable
with
regard
to
the
natural
than
the
artificial
virtues
it
is
certain
that
the
imagination
is
more
affected
by
what
is
particular
than
by
what
is
general
and
that
the
sentiments
are
always
moved
with
difficulty
where
their
objects
are
in
any
degree
loose
and
undetermined
now
every
particular
act
of
justice
is
not
beneficial
to
society
but
the
whole
scheme
or
system
and
it
may
not
perhaps
be
any
individual
person
for
whom
we
are
concerned
who
receives
benefit
from
justice
but
the
whole
society
alike
on
the
contrary
every
particular
act
of
generosity
or
relief
of
the
industrious
and
indigent
is
beneficial
and
is
beneficial
to
a
particular
person
who
is
not
undeserving
of
it
it
is
more
natural
therefore
to
think
that
the
tendencies
of
the
latter
virtue
will
affect
our
sentiments
and
command
our
approbation
than
those
of
the
former
and
therefore
since
we
find
that
the
approbation
of
the
former
arises
from
their
tendencies
we
may
ascribe
with
better
reason
the
same
cause
to
the
approbation
of
the
latter
in
any
number
of
similar
effects
if
a
cause
can
be
discovered
for
one
we
ought
to
extend
that
cause
to
all
the
other
effects
which
can
be
accounted
for
by
it
but
much
more
if
these
other
effects
be
attended
with
peculiar
circumstances
which
facilitate
the
operation
of
that
cause
before
i
proceed
farther
i
must
observe
two
remarkable
circumstances
in
this
affair
which
may
seem
objections
to
the
present
system
the
first
may
be
thus
explained
when
any
quality
or
character
has
a
tendency
to
the
good
of
mankind
we
are
pleased
with
it
and
approve
of
it
because
it
presents
the
lively
idea
of
pleasure
which
idea
affects
us
by
sympathy
and
is
itself
a
kind
of
pleasure
but
as
this
sympathy
is
very
variable
it
may
be
thought
that
our
sentiments
of
morals
must
admit
of
all
the
same
variations
we
sympathize
more
with
persons
contiguous
to
us
than
with
persons
remote
from
us
with
our
acquaintance
than
with
strangers
with
our
countrymen
than
with
foreigners
but
notwithstanding
this
variation
of
our
sympathy
we
give
the
same
approbation
to
the
same
moral
qualities
in
china
as
in
england
they
appear
equally
virtuous
and
recommend
themselves
equally
to
the
esteem
of
a
judicious
spectator
the
sympathy
varies
without
a
variation
in
our
esteem
our
esteem
therefore
proceeds
not
from
sympathy
to
this
i
answer
the
approbation
of
moral
qualities
most
certainly
is
not
derived
from
reason
or
any
comparison
of
ideas
but
proceeds
entirely
from
a
moral
taste
and
from
certain
sentiments
of
pleasure
or
disgust
which
arise
upon
the
contemplation
and
view
of
particular
qualities
or
characters
now
it
is
evident
that
those
sentiments
they
are
derived
must
vary
according
to
the
distance
or
contiguity
of
the
objects
nor
can
i
feel
the
same
lively
pleasure
from
the
virtues
of
a
person
who
lived
in
greece
two
thousand
years
ago
that
i
feel
from
the
virtues
of
a
familiar
friend
and
acquaintance
yet
i
do
not
say
that
i
esteem
the
one
more
than
the
other
and
therefore
if
the
variation
of
the
sentiment
without
a
variation
of
the
esteem
be
an
objection
it
must
have
equal
force
against
every
other
system
as
against
that
of
sympathy
but
to
consider
the
matter
it
has
no
force
at
all
and
it
is
the
easiest
matter
in
the
world
to
account
for
it
our
situation
with
regard
both
to
persons
and
things
is
in
continual
fluctuation
and
a
man
that
lies
at
a
distance
from
us
may
in
a
little
time
become
a
familiar
acquaintance
besides
every
particular
man
has
a
peculiar
position
with
regard
to
others
and
it
is
impossible
we
coued
ever
converse
together
on
any
reasonable
terms
were
each
of
us
to
consider
characters
and
persons
only
as
they
appear
from
his
peculiar
point
of
view
in
order
therefore
to
prevent
those
continual
contradictions
and
arrive
at
a
more
stable
judgment
of
things
we
fix
on
some
steady
and
general
points
of
view
and
always
in
our
thoughts
place
ourselves
in
them
whatever
may
be
our
present
situation
in
like
manner
external
beauty
is
determined
merely
by
pleasure
and
it
is
evident
a
beautiful
countenance
can
not
give
so
much
pleasure
when
seen
at
the
distance
of
twenty
paces
as
when
it
is
brought
nearer
us
we
say
not
however
that
it
appears
to
us
less
beautiful
because
we
know
what
effect
it
will
have
in
such
a
position
and
by
that
reflection
we
correct
its
momentary
appearance
in
general
all
sentiments
of
blame
or
praise
are
variable
according
to
our
situation
of
nearness
or
remoteness
with
regard
to
the
person
blamed
or
praised
and
according
to
the
present
disposition
of
our
mind
but
these
variations
we
regard
not
in
our
general
decision
but
still
apply
the
terms
expressive
of
our
liking
or
dislike
in
the
same
manner
as
if
we
remained
in
one
point
of
view
experience
soon
teaches
us
this
method
of
correcting
our
sentiments
or
at
least
of
correcting
our
language
where
the
sentiments
are
more
stubborn
and
inalterable
our
servant
if
diligent
and
faithful
may
excite
stronger
sentiments
of
love
and
kindness
than
marcus
brutus
as
represented
in
history
but
we
say
not
upon
that
account
that
the
former
character
is
more
laudable
than
the
latter
we
know
that
were
we
to
approach
equally
near
to
that
renowned
patriot
he
would
command
a
much
higher
degree
of
affection
and
admiration
such
corrections
are
common
with
regard
to
all
the
senses
and
indeed
it
were
impossible
we
could
ever
make
use
of
language
or
communicate
our
sentiments
to
one
another
did
we
not
correct
the
momentary
appearances
of
things
and
overlook
our
present
situation
it
is
therefore
from
the
influence
of
characters
and
qualities
upon
those
who
have
an
intercourse
with
any
person
that
we
blame
or
praise
him
we
consider
not
whether
the
persons
affected
by
the
qualities
be
our
acquaintance
or
strangers
countrymen
or
foreigners
nay
we
our
own
interest
in
those
general
judgments
and
blame
not
a
man
for
opposing
us
in
any
of
our
pretensions
when
his
own
interest
is
particularly
concerned
we
make
allowance
for
a
certain
degree
of
selfishness
in
men
because
we
know
it
to
be
inseparable
from
human
nature
and
inherent
in
our
frame
and
constitution
by
this
reflection
we
correct
those
sentiments
of
blame
which
so
naturally
arise
upon
any
opposition
but
however
the
general
principle
of
our
blame
or
praise
may
be
corrected
by
those
other
principles
it
is
certain
they
are
not
altogether
efficacious
nor
do
our
passions
often
correspond
entirely
to
the
present
theory
it
is
seldom
men
heartily
love
what
lies
at
a
distance
from
them
and
what
no
way
redounds
to
their
particular
benefit
as
it
is
no
less
rare
to
meet
with
persons
who
can
pardon
another
any
opposition
he
makes
to
their
interest
however
justifiable
that
opposition
may
be
by
the
general
rules
of
morality
here
we
are
contented
with
saying
that
reason
requires
such
an
impartial
conduct
but
that
it
is
seldom
we
can
bring
ourselves
to
it
and
that
our
passions
do
not
readily
follow
the
determination
of
our
judgment
this
language
will
be
easily
understood
if
we
consider
what
we
formerly
said
concerning
that
reason
which
is
able
to
oppose
our
passion
and
which
we
have
found
to
be
nothing
but
a
general
calm
determination
of
the
passions
founded
on
some
distant
view
or
reflection
when
we
form
our
judgments
of
persons
merely
from
the
tendency
of
their
characters
to
our
own
benefit
or
to
that
of
our
friends
we
find
so
many
contradictions
to
our
sentiments
in
society
and
conversation
and
such
an
uncertainty
from
the
incessant
changes
of
our
situation
that
we
seek
some
other
standard
of
merit
and
demerit
which
may
not
admit
of
so
great
variation
being
thus
loosened
from
our
first
station
we
can
not
afterwards
fix
ourselves
so
commodiously
by
any
means
as
by
a
sympathy
with
those
who
have
any
commerce
with
the
person
we
consider
this
is
far
from
being
as
lively
as
when
our
own
interest
is
concerned
or
that
of
our
particular
friends
nor
has
it
such
an
influence
on
our
love
and
hatred
but
being
equally
conformable
to
our
calm
and
general
principles
it
is
said
to
have
an
equal
authority
over
our
reason
and
to
command
our
judgment
and
opinion
we
blame
equally
a
bad
action
which
we
read
of
in
history
with
one
performed
in
our
neighbourhood
the
other
day
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
we
know
from
reflection
that
the
former
action
would
excite
as
strong
sentiments
of
disapprobation
as
the
latter
were
it
placed
in
the
same
position
i
now
proceed
to
the
second
remarkable
circumstance
which
i
proposed
to
take
notice
of
where
a
person
is
possessed
of
a
character
that
in
its
natural
tendency
is
beneficial
to
society
we
esteem
him
virtuous
and
are
delighted
with
the
view
of
his
character
even
though
particular
accidents
prevent
its
operation
and
incapacitate
him
from
being
serviceable
to
his
friends
and
country
virtue
in
rags
is
still
virtue
and
the
love
which
it
procures
attends
a
man
into
a
dungeon
or
desart
where
the
virtue
can
no
longer
be
exerted
in
action
and
is
lost
to
all
the
world
now
this
may
be
esteemed
an
objection
to
the
present
system
sympathy
interests
us
in
the
good
of
mankind
and
if
sympathy
were
the
source
of
our
esteem
for
virtue
that
sentiment
of
approbation
coued
only
take
place
where
the
virtue
actually
attained
its
end
and
was
beneficial
to
mankind
where
it
fails
of
its
end
it
is
only
an
imperfect
means
and
therefore
can
never
acquire
any
merit
from
that
end
the
goodness
of
an
end
can
bestow
a
merit
on
such
means
alone
as
are
compleat
and
actually
produce
the
end
to
this
we
may
reply
that
where
any
object
in
all
its
parts
is
fitted
to
attain
any
agreeable
end
it
naturally
gives
us
pleasure
and
is
esteemed
beautiful
even
though
some
external
circumstances
be
wanting
to
render
it
altogether
effectual
it
is
sufficient
if
every
thing
be
compleat
in
the
object
itself
a
house
that
is
contrived
with
great
judgment
for
all
the
commodities
of
life
pleases
us
upon
that
account
though
perhaps
we
are
sensible
that
noone
will
ever
dwell
in
it
a
fertile
soil
and
a
happy
climate
delight
us
by
a
reflection
on
the
happiness
which
they
would
afford
the
inhabitants
though
at
present
the
country
be
desart
and
uninhabited
a
man
whose
limbs
and
shape
promise
strength
and
activity
is
esteemed
handsome
though
condemned
to
perpetual
imprisonment
the
imagination
has
a
set
of
passions
belonging
to
it
upon
which
our
sentiments
of
beauty
much
depend
these
passions
are
moved
by
degrees
of
liveliness
and
strength
which
are
inferior
to
belief
and
independent
of
the
real
existence
of
their
objects
where
a
character
is
in
every
respect
fitted
to
be
beneficial
to
society
the
imagination
passes
easily
from
the
cause
to
the
effect
without
considering
that
there
are
some
circumstances
wanting
to
render
the
cause
a
complete
one
general
rules
create
a
species
of
probability
which
sometimes
influences
the
judgment
and
always
the
imagination
it
is
true
when
the
cause
is
compleat
and
a
good
disposition
is
attended
with
good
fortune
which
renders
it
really
beneficial
to
society
it
gives
a
stronger
pleasure
to
the
spectator
and
is
attended
with
a
more
lively
sympathy
we
are
more
affected
by
it
and
yet
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
more
virtuous
or
that
we
esteem
it
more
we
know
that
an
alteration
of
fortune
may
render
the
benevolent
disposition
entirely
impotent
and
therefore
we
separate
as
much
as
possible
the
fortune
from
the
disposition
the
case
is
the
same
as
when
we
correct
the
different
sentiments
of
virtue
which
proceed
from
its
different
distances
from
ourselves
the
passions
do
not
always
follow
our
corrections
but
these
corrections
serve
sufficiently
to
regulate
our
abstract
notions
and
are
alone
regarded
when
we
pronounce
in
general
concerning
the
degrees
of
vice
and
virtue
it
is
observed
by
critics
that
all
words
or
sentences
which
are
difficult
to
the
pronunciation
are
disagreeable
to
the
ear
there
is
no
difference
whether
a
man
hear
them
pronounced
or
read
them
silently
to
himself
when
i
run
over
a
book
with
my
eye
i
imagine
i
hear
it
all
and
also
by
the
force
of
imagination
enter
into
the
uneasiness
which
the
delivery
of
it
would
give
the
speaker
the
uneasiness
is
not
real
but
as
such
a
composition
of
words
has
a
natural
tendency
to
produce
it
this
is
sufficient
to
affect
the
mind
with
a
painful
sentiment
and
render
the
discourse
harsh
and
disagreeable
it
is
a
similar
case
where
any
real
quality
is
by
accidental
circumstances
rendered
impotent
and
is
deprived
of
its
natural
influence
on
society
upon
these
principles
we
may
easily
remove
any
contradiction
which
may
appear
to
be
betwixt
the
extensive
sympathy
on
which
our
sentiments
of
virtue
depend
and
that
limited
generosity
which
i
have
frequently
observed
to
be
natural
to
men
and
which
justice
and
property
suppose
according
to
the
precedent
reasoning
my
sympathy
with
another
may
give
me
the
sentiment
of
pain
and
disapprobation
when
any
object
is
presented
that
has
a
tendency
to
give
him
uneasiness
though
i
may
not
be
willing
to
sacrifice
any
thing
of
my
own
interest
or
cross
any
of
my
passions
for
his
satisfaction
a
house
may
displease
me
by
being
for
the
convenience
of
the
owner
and
yet
i
may
refuse
to
give
a
shilling
towards
the
rebuilding
of
it
sentiments
must
touch
the
heart
to
make
them
controul
our
passions
but
they
need
not
extend
beyond
the
imagination
to
make
them
influence
our
taste
when
a
building
seems
clumsy
and
tottering
to
the
eye
it
is
ugly
and
disagreeable
though
we
be
fully
assured
of
the
solidity
of
the
workmanship
it
is
a
kind
of
fear
which
causes
this
sentiment
of
disapprobation
but
the
passion
is
not
the
same
with
that
which
we
feel
when
obliged
to
stand
under
a
wall
that
we
really
think
tottering
and
insecure
the
seeming
tendencies
of
objects
affect
the
mind
and
the
emotions
they
excite
are
of
a
like
species
with
those
which
proceed
from
the
real
consequences
of
objects
but
their
feeling
is
different
nay
these
emotions
are
so
different
in
their
feeling
that
they
may
often
be
contrary
without
destroying
each
other
as
when
the
fortifications
of
a
city
belonging
to
an
enemy
are
esteemed
beautiful
upon
account
of
their
strength
though
we
coued
wish
that
they
were
entirely
destroyed
the
imagination
adheres
to
the
general
views
of
things
and
distinguishes
the
feelings
they
produce
from
those
which
arise
from
our
particular
and
momentary
situation
if
we
examine
the
panegyrics
that
are
commonly
made
of
great
men
we
shall
find
that
most
of
the
qualities
which
are
attributed
to
them
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
viz
such
as
make
them
perform
their
part
in
society
and
such
as
render
them
serviceable
to
themselves
and
enable
them
to
promote
their
own
interest
their
prudence
temperance
frugality
industry
assiduity
enterprize
dexterity
are
celebrated
as
well
as
their
generosity
and
humanity
if
we
ever
give
an
indulgence
to
any
quality
that
disables
a
man
from
making
a
figure
in
life
it
is
to
that
of
indolence
which
is
not
supposed
to
deprive
one
of
his
parts
and
capacity
but
only
suspends
their
exercise
and
that
without
any
inconvenience
to
the
person
himself
since
it
is
in
some
measure
from
his
own
choice
yet
indolence
is
always
allowed
to
be
a
fault
and
a
very
great
one
if
extreme
nor
do
a
man
friends
ever
acknowledge
him
to
be
subject
to
it
but
in
order
to
save
his
character
in
more
material
articles
he
coued
make
a
figure
say
they
if
he
pleased
to
give
application
his
understanding
is
sound
his
conception
quick
and
his
memory
tenacious
but
he
hates
business
and
is
indifferent
about
his
fortune
and
this
a
man
sometimes
may
make
even
a
subject
of
vanity
though
with
the
air
of
confessing
a
fault
because
he
may
think
that
his
incapacity
for
business
implies
much
more
noble
qualities
such
as
a
philosophical
spirit
a
fine
taste
a
delicate
wit
or
a
relish
for
pleasure
and
society
but
take
any
other
case
suppose
a
quality
that
without
being
an
indication
of
any
other
good
qualities
incapacitates
a
man
always
for
business
and
is
destructive
to
his
interest
such
as
a
blundering
understanding
and
a
wrong
judgment
of
every
thing
in
life
inconstancy
and
irresolution
or
a
want
of
address
in
the
management
of
men
and
business
these
are
all
allowed
to
be
imperfections
in
a
character
and
many
men
would
rather
acknowledge
the
greatest
crimes
than
have
it
suspected
that
they
are
in
any
degree
subject
to
them
it
is
very
happy
in
our
philosophical
researches
when
we
find
the
same
phaenomenon
diversified
by
a
variety
of
circumstances
and
by
discovering
what
is
common
among
them
can
the
better
assure
ourselves
of
the
truth
of
any
hypothesis
we
may
make
use
of
to
explain
it
were
nothing
esteemed
virtue
but
what
were
beneficial
to
society
i
am
persuaded
that
the
foregoing
explication
of
the
moral
sense
ought
still
to
be
received
and
that
upon
sufficient
evidence
but
this
evidence
must
grow
upon
us
when
we
find
other
kinds
of
virtue
which
will
not
admit
of
any
explication
except
from
that
hypothesis
here
is
a
man
who
is
not
remarkably
defective
in
his
social
qualities
but
what
principally
recommends
him
is
his
dexterity
in
business
by
which
he
has
extricated
himself
from
the
greatest
difficulties
and
conducted
the
most
delicate
affairs
with
a
singular
address
and
prudence
i
find
an
esteem
for
him
immediately
to
arise
in
me
his
company
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
and
before
i
have
any
farther
acquaintance
with
him
i
would
rather
do
him
a
service
than
another
whose
character
is
in
every
other
respect
equal
but
is
deficient
in
that
particular
in
this
case
the
qualities
that
please
me
are
all
considered
as
useful
to
the
person
and
as
having
a
tendency
to
promote
his
interest
and
satisfaction
they
are
only
regarded
as
means
to
an
end
and
please
me
in
proportion
to
their
fitness
for
that
end
the
end
therefore
must
be
agreeable
to
me
but
what
makes
the
end
agreeable
the

a
stranger
i
am
no
way
interested
in
him
nor
lie
under
any
obligation
to
him
his
happiness
concerns
not
me
farther
than
the
happiness
of
every
human
and
indeed
of
every
sensible
creature
that
is
it
affects
me
only
by
sympathy
from
that

whenever
i
discover

in
its

or
effects
i
enter
so

into

that
it
gives
me
a
sensible
emotion
the

qualities
that
have
a
tendency
to
promote
it
have
an
agreeable
effect
upon
my
imagination
and
command
my
love
and

this
theory
may
serve
to
explain
why
the
same
qualities
in
all
cases
produce
both
pride
and
love
humility
and
hatred
and
the
same
man
is
always
virtuous
or
vicious
accomplished
or
despicable
to
others
who
is
so
to
himself
a
person
in
whom
we
discover
any
passion
or
habit
which
originally
is
only
incommodious
to
himself
becomes
always
disagreeable
to
us
merely
on
its
account
as
on
the
other
hand
one
whose
character
is
only
dangerous
and
disagreeable
to
others
can
never
be
satisfied
with
himself
as
long
as
he
is
sensible
of
that
disadvantage
nor
is
this
observable
only
with
regard
to
characters
and
manners
but
may
be
remarked
even
in
the
most
minute
circumstances
a
violent
cough
in
another
gives
us
uneasiness
though
in
itself
it
does
not
in
the
least
affect
us
a
man
will
be
mortified
if
you
tell
him
he
has
a
stinking
breath
though
it
is
evidently
no
annoyance
to
himself
our
fancy
easily
changes
its
situation
and
either
surveying
ourselves
as
we
appear
to
others
or
considering
others
as
they
feel
themselves
we
enter
by
that
means
into
sentiments
which
no
way
belong
to
us
and
in
which
nothing
but
sympathy
is
able
to
interest
us
and
this
sympathy
we
sometimes
carry
so
far
as
even
to
be
displeased
with
a
quality
commodious
to
us
merely
because
it
displeases
others
and
makes
us
disagreeable
in
their
eyes
though
perhaps
we
never
can
have
any
interest
in
rendering
ourselves
agreeable
to
them
there
have
been
many
systems
of
morality
advanced
by
philosophers
in
all
ages
but
if
they
are
strictly
examined
they
may
be
reduced
to
two
which
alone
merit
our
attention
moral
good
and
evil
are
certainly
distinguished
by
our
sentiments
not
by
reason
but
these
sentiments
may
arise
either
from
the
mere
species
or
appearance
of
characters
and
passions
or
from
reflections
on
their
tendency
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
of
particular
persons
my
opinion
is
that
both
these
causes
are
intermixed
in
our
judgments
of
morals
after
the
same
manner
as
they
are
in
our
decisions
concerning
most
kinds
of
external
beauty
though
i
am
also
of
opinion
that
reflections
on
the
tendencies
of
actions
have
by
far
the
greatest
influence
and
determine
all
the
great
lines
of
our
duty
there
are
however
instances
in
cases
of
less
moment
wherein
this
immediate
taste
or
sentiment
produces
our
approbation
wit
and
a
certain
easy
and
disengaged
behaviour
are
qualities
immediately
agreeable
to
others
and
command
their
love
and
esteem
some
of
these
qualities
produce
satisfaction
in
others
by
particular
original
principles
of
human
nature
which
can
not
be
accounted
for
others
may
be
resolved
into
principles
which
are
more
general
this
will
best
appear
upon
a
particular
enquiry
as
some
qualities
acquire
their
merit
from
their
being
immediately
agreeable
to
others
without
any
tendency
to
public
interest
so
some
are
denominated
virtuous
from
their
being
immediately
agreeable
to
the
person
himself
who
possesses
them
each
of
the
passions
and
operations
of
the
mind
has
a
particular
feeling
which
must
be
either
agreeable
or
disagreeable
the
first
is
virtuous
the
second
vicious
this
particular
feeling
constitutes
the
very
nature
of
the
passion
and
therefore
needs
not
be
accounted
for
but
however
directly
the
distinction
of
vice
and
virtue
may
seem
to
flow
from
the
immediate
pleasure
or
uneasiness
which
particular
qualities
cause
to
ourselves
or
others
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
it
has
also
a
considerable
dependence
on
the
principle
of
sympathy
so
often
insisted
on
we
approve
of
a
person
who
is
possessed
of
qualities
immediately
agreeable
to
those
with
whom
he
has
any
commerce
though
perhaps
we
ourselves
never
reaped
any
pleasure
from
them
we
also
approve
of
one
who
is
possessed
of
qualities
that
are
immediately
agreeable
to
himself
though
they
be
of
no
service
to
any
mortal
to
account
for
this
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
foregoing
principles
thus
to
take
a
general
review
of
the
present
hypothesis
every
quality
of
the
mind
is
denominated
virtuous
which
gives
pleasure
by
the
mere
survey
as
every
quality
which
produces
pain
is
called
vicious
this
pleasure
and
this
pain
may
arise
from
four
different
sources
for
we
reap
a
pleasure
from
the
view
of
a
character
which
is
naturally
fitted
to
be
useful
to
others
or
to
the
person
himself
or
which
is
agreeable
to
others
or
to
the
person
himself
one
may
perhaps
be
surprized
that
amidst
all
these
interests
and
pleasures
we
should
forget
our
own
which
touch
us
so
nearly
on
every
other
occasion
but
we
shall
easily
satisfy
ourselves
on
this
head
when
we
consider
that
every
particular
person
s
pleasure
and
interest
being
different
it
is
impossible
men
coued
ever
agree
in
their
sentiments
and
judgments
unless
they
chose
some
common
point
of
view
from
which
they
might
survey
their
object
and
which
might
cause
it
to
appear
the
same
to
all
of
them
now
in
judging
of
characters
the
only
interest
or
pleasure
which
appears
the
same
to
every
spectator
is
that
of
the
person
himself
whose
character
is
examined
or
that
of
persons
who
have
a
connexion
with
him
and
though
such
interests
and
pleasures
touch
us
more
faintly
than
our
own
yet
being
more
constant
and
universal
they
the
latter
even
in
practice
and
are
alone
admitted
in
speculation
as
the
standard
of
virtue
and
morality
they
alone
produce
that
particular
feeling
or
sentiment
on
which
moral
distinctions
depend
as
to
the
good
or
ill
desert
of
virtue
or
vice
it
is
an
evident
consequence
of
the
sentiments
of
pleasure
or
uneasiness
these
sentiments
produce
love
or
hatred
and
love
or
hatred
by
the
original
constitution
of
human
passion
is
attended
with
benevolence
or
anger
that
is
with
a
desire
of
making
happy
the
person
we
love
and
miserable
the
person
we
hate
we
have
treated
of
this
more
fully
on
another
occasion
sect
ii
of
greatness
of
mind
it
may
now
be
proper
to
illustrate
this
general
system
of
morals
by
applying
it
to
particular
instances
of
virtue
and
vice
and
shewing
how
their
merit
or
demerit
arises
from
the
four
sources
here
explained
we
shall
begin
with
examining
the
passions
of
pride
and
humility
and
shall
consider
the
vice
or
virtue
that
lies
in
their
excesses
or
just
proportion
an
excessive
pride
or
overweaning
conceit
of
ourselves
is
always
esteemed
vicious
and
is
universally
hated
as
modesty
or
a
just
sense
of
our
weakness
is
esteemed
virtuous
and
procures
the
of
of
the
four
sources
of
moral
distinctions
this
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
third
viz
the
immediate
agreeableness
and
disagreeableness
of
a
quality
to
others
without
any
reflections
on
the
tendency
of
that
quality
in
order
to
prove
this
we
must
have
recourse
to
two
principles
which
are
very
conspicuous
in
human
nature
the
first
of
these
is
the
sympathy
and
communication
of
sentiments
and
passions
so
close
and
intimate
is
the
correspondence
of
human
souls
that
no
sooner
any
person
approaches
me
than
he
diffuses
on
me
all
his
opinions
and
draws
along
my
judgment
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
and
though
on
many
occasions
my
sympathy
with
him
goes
not
so
far
as
entirely
to
change
my
sentiments
and
way
of
thinking
yet
it
seldom
is
so
weak
as
not
to
disturb
the
easy
course
of
my
thought
and
give
an
authority
to
that
opinion
which
is
recommended
to
me
by
his
assent
and
approbation
nor
is
it
any
way
material
upon
what
subject
he
and
i
employ
our
thoughts
whether
we
judge
of
an
indifferent
person
or
of
my
own
character
my
sympathy
gives
equal
force
to
his
decision
and
even
his
sentiments
of
his
own
merit
make
me
consider
him
in
the
same
light
in
which
he
regards
himself
this
principle
of
sympathy
is
of
so
powerful
and
insinuating
a
nature
that
it
enters
into
most
of
our
sentiments
and
passions
and
often
takes
place
under
the
appearance
of
its
contrary
for
it
is
remarkable
that
when
a
person
opposes
me
in
any
thing
which
i
am
strongly
bent
upon
and
rouzes
up
my
passion
by
contradiction
i
have
always
a
degree
of
sympathy
with
him
nor
does
my
commotion
proceed
from
any
other
origin
we
may
here
observe
an
evident
conflict
or
rencounter
of
opposite
principles
and
passions
on
the
one
side
there
is
that
passion
or
sentiment
which
is
natural
to
me
and
it
is
observable
that
the
stronger
this
passion
is
the
greater
is
the
commotion
there
must
also
be
some
passion
or
sentiment
on
the
other
side
and
this
passion
can
proceed
from
nothing
but
sympathy
the
sentiments
of
others
can
never
affect
us
but
by
becoming
in
some
measure
our
own
in
which
case
they
operate
upon
us
by
opposing
and
encreasing
our
passions
in
the
very
same
manner
as
if
they
had
been
originally
derived
from
our
own
temper
and
disposition
while
they
remain
concealed
in
the
minds
of
others
they
can
never
have
an
influence
upon
us
and
even
when
they
are
known
if
they
went
no
farther
than
the
imagination
or
conception
that
faculty
is
so
accustomed
to
objects
of
every
different
kind
that
a
mere
idea
though
contrary
to
our
sentiments
and
inclinations
would
never
alone
be
able
to
affect
us
the
second
principle
i
shall
take
notice
of
is
that
of
comparison
or
the
variation
of
our
judgments
concerning
ob
jects
according
to
the
proportion
they
bear
to
those
with
which
we
compare
them
we
judge
more
of
objects
by
comparison
than
by
their
intrinsic
worth
and
value
and
regard
every
thing
as
mean
when
set
in
opposition
to
what
is
superior
of
the
same
kind
but
no
comparison
is
more
obvious
than
that
with
ourselves
and
hence
it
is
that
on
all
occasions
it
takes
place
and
mixes
with
most
of
our
passions
this
kind
of
comparison
is
directly
contrary
to
sympathy
in
its
operation
as
we
have
observed
in
treating
of
com
passion
and
malice
book
ii
part
ii
sect
viii
in
all
kinds
of
comparison
an
object
makes
us
always
receive
from
another
to
which
it
is
compared
a
sensation
contrary
to
what
arises
from
itself
in
its
direct
and
immediate
survey
the
direct
survey
of
another
pleasure
naturally
gives
us
pleasure
and
therefore
produces
pain
when
compared
with
our
own
his
pain
considered
in
itself
is
pain
ful
but
augments
the
idea
of
our
own
happiness
and
gives
us
pleasure
since
then
those
principles
of
sympathy
and
a
comparison
with
ourselves
are
directly
contrary
it
may
be
worth
while
to
consider
what
general
rules
can
be
formed
beside
the
particular
temper
of
the
person
for
the
prevalence
of
the
one
or
the
other
suppose
i
am
now
in
safety
at
land
and
would
willingly
reap
some
pleasure
from
this
consideration
i
must
think
on
the
miserable
condition
of
those
who
are
at
sea
in
a
storm
and
must
endeavour
to
render
this
idea
as
strong
and
lively
as
possible
in
order
to
make
me
more
sensible
of
my
own
happiness
but
whatever
pains
i
may
take
the
comparison
will
never
have
an
equal
efficacy
as
if
i
were
really
on
the
shore
footnote
and
saw
a
ship
at
a
distance
tossed
by
a
tempest
and
in
danger
every
moment
of
perishing
on
a
rock
or
but
suppose
this
idea
to
become
still
more
lively
suppose
the
ship
to
be
driven
so
near
me
that
i
can
perceive
distinctly
the
horror
painted
on
the
countenance
of
the
seamen
and
passengers
hear
their
lamentable
cries
see
the
dearest
friends
give
their
last
adieu
or
embrace
with
a
resolution
to
perish
in
each
others
arms
no
man
has
so
savage
a
heart
as
to
reap
any
pleasure
from
such
a
spectacle
or
withstand
the
motions
of
the
tenderest
compassion
and
sympathy
it
is
evident
therefore
there
is
a
medium
in
this
case
and
that
if
the
idea
be
too
feint
it
has
no
influence
by
comparison
and
on
the
other
hand
if
it
be
too
strong
it
operates
on
us
entirely
by
sympathy
which
is
the
contrary
to
comparison
sympathy
being
the
conversion
of
an
idea
into
an
impression
demands
a
greater
force
and
vivacity
in
the
idea
than
is
requisite
to
comparison

fiction

when

persuaded
to
be
of
inferior
merit
is

us
if
we
observe
in
him
any
extraordinary
degree
of
pride

the
firm
persuasion
he
has
of
his
own
merit
takes
hold
of
the
imagination

diminishes
us
in
our
own
eyes
in
the
same
manner
as
if
he
were
really
possessed
of
all
the
good
qualities
which
he
so
liberally
attributes
to
himself
our
idea
is
here
precisely
in
that
medium
which
is
requisite
to
make
it
operate
on
us
by
comparison
were
it
accompanied
with
belief
and
did
the
person
appear
to
have
the
same
merit
which
he
assumes
to
himself
it
would
have
a
contrary
effect
and
would
operate
on
us
by
sympathy
the
influence
of
that
principle
would
then
be
superior
to
that
of
comparison
contrary
to
what
happens
where
the
person
merit
seems
below
his
pretensions
the
necessary
consequence
of
these
principles
is
that
pride
or
an
conceit
of
ourselves
must
be
vicious
since
it
causes
uneasiness
in
all
men
and
presents
them
every
moment
with
a
disagreeable
comparison
it
is
a
trite
observation
in
philosophy
and
even
in
common
life
and
conversation
that
it
is
our
own
pride
which
makes
us
so
much
displeased
with
the
pride
of
other
people
and
that
vanity
becomes
insupportable
to
us
merely
because
we
are
vain
the
gay
naturally
associate
themselves
with
the
gay
and
the
amorous
with
the
amorous
but
the
proud
never
can
endure
the
proud
and
rather
seek
the
company
of
those
who
are
of
an
opposite
disposition
as
we
are
all
of
us
proud
in
some
degree
pride
is
universally
blamed
and
condemned
by
all
mankind
as
having
a
natural
tendency
to
cause
uneasiness
in
others
by
means
of
comparison
and
this
effect
must
follow
the
more
naturally
that
those
who
have
an
conceit
of
themselves
are
for
ever
making
those
comparisons
nor
have
they
any
other
method
of
supporting
their
vanity
a
man
of
sense
and
merit
is
pleased
with
himself
independent
of
all
foreign
considerations
but
a
fool
must
always
find
some
person
that
is
more
foolish
in
order
to
keep
himself
in
good
humour
with
his
own
parts
and
understanding
but
though
an
conceit
of
our
own
merit
be
vicious
and
disagreeable
nothing
can
be
more
laudable
than
to
have
a
value
for
ourselves
where
we
really
have
qualities
that
are
valuable
the
utility
and
advantage
of
any
quality
to
ourselves
is
a
source
of
virtue
as
well
as
its
agreeableness
to
others
and
it
is
certain
that
nothing
is
more
useful
to
us
in
the
conduct
of
life
than
a
due
degree
of
pride
which
makes
us
sensible
of
our
own
merit
and
gives
us
a
confidence
and
assurance
in
all
our
projects
and
enterprizes
whatever
capacity
any
one
may
be
endowed
with
it
is
entirely
useless
to
him
if
he
be
not
acquainted
with
it
and
form
not
designs
suitable
to
it
it
is
requisite
on
all
occasions
to
know
our
own
force
and
were
it
allowable
to
err
on
either
side
it
would
be
more
advantageous
to
our
merit
than
to
form
ideas
of
it
below
its
just
standard
fortune
commonly
favours
the
bold
and
enterprizing
and
nothing
inspires
us
with
more
boldness
than
a
good
opinion
of
ourselves
add
to
this
that
though
pride
or
be
sometimes
disagreeable
to
others
it
is
always
agreeable
to
ourselves
as
on
the
other
hand
modesty
though
it
gives
pleasure
to
every
one
who
observes
it
produces
often
uneasiness
in
the
person
endowed
with
it
now
it
has
been
observed
that
our
own
sensations
determine
the
vice
and
virtue
of
any
quality
as
well
as
those
sensations
which
it
may
excite
in
others
thus
and
vanity
may
not
only
be
allowable
but
requisite
in
a
character
it
is
however
certain
that
and
decency
require
that
we
should
avoid
all
signs
and
expressions
which
tend
directly
to
show
that
passion
we
have
all
of
us
a
wonderful
partiality
for
ourselves
and
were
we
always
to
give
vent
to
our
sentiments
in
this
particular
we
should
mutually
cause
the
greatest
indignation
in
each
other
not
only
by
the
immediate
presence
of
so
disagreeable
a
subject
of
comparison
but
also
by
the
contrariety
of
our
judgments
in
like
manner
therefore
as
we
establish
the
laws
of
nature
in
order
to
secure
property
in
society
and
prevent
the
opposition
of
we
establish
the
rules
of
in
order
to
prevent
the
opposition
of
men
pride
and
render
conversation
agreeable
and
inoffensive
nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
a
man
conceit
of
himself
every
one
almost
has
a
strong
propensity
to
this
vice
no
one
can
well
distinguish
in
himself
betwixt
the
vice
and
virtue
or
be
certain
that
his
esteem
of
his
own
merit
is
for
these
reasons
all
direct
expressions
of
this
passion
are
condemned
nor
do
we
make
any
exception
to
this
rule
in
favour
of
men
of
sense
and
merit
they
are
not
allowed
to
do
themselves
justice
openly
in
words
no
more
than
other
people
and
even
if
they
show
a
reserve
and
secret
doubt
in
doing
themselves
justice
in
their
own
thoughts
they
will
be
more
applauded
that
impertinent
and
almost
universal
propensity
of
men
to
themselves
has
given
us
such
a
prejudice
against
that
we
are
apt
to
condemn
it
by
a
general
rule
wherever
we
meet
with
it
and
it
is
with
some
difficulty
we
give
a
privilege
to
men
of
sense
even
in
their
most
secret
thoughts
at
least
it
must
be
owned
that
some
disguise
in
this
particular
is
absolutely
requisite
and
that
if
we
harbour
pride
in
our
breasts
we
must
carry
a
fair
outside
and
have
the
appearance
of
modesty
and
mutual
deference
in
all
our
conduct
and
behaviour
we
must
on
every
occasion
be
ready
to
prefer
others
to
ourselves
to
treat
them
with
a
kind
of
deference
even
though
they
be
our
equals
to
seem
always
the
lowest
and
least
in
the
company
where
we
are
not
very
much
distinguished
above
them
and
if
we
observe
these
rules
in
our
conduct
men
will
have
more
indulgence
for
our
secret
sentiments
when
we
discover
them
in
an
oblique
manner
i
believe
no
one
who
has
any
practice
of
the
world
and
can
penetrate
into
the
inward
sentiments
of
men
will
assert
that
the
humility
which
and
decency
require
of
us
goes
beyond
the
outside
or
that
a
thorough
sincerity
in
this
particular
is
esteemed
a
real
part
of
our
duty
on
the
contrary
we
may
observe
that
a
genuine
and
hearty
pride
or
if
well
concealed
and
well
founded
is
essential
to
the
character
of
a
man
of
honour
and
that
there
is
no
quality
of
the
mind
which
is
more
indispensibly
requisite
to
procure
the
esteem
and
approbation
of
mankind
there
are
certain
deferences
and
mutual
submissions
which
custom
requires
of
the
different
ranks
of
men
towards
each
other
and
whoever
exceeds
in
this
particular
if
through
interest
is
accused
of
meanness
if
through
ignorance
of
simplicity
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
know
our
rank
and
station
in
the
world
whether
it
be
fixed
by
our
birth
fortune
employments
talents
or
reputation
it
is
necessary
to
feel
the
sentiment
and
passion
of
pride
in
conformity
to
it
and
to
regulate
our
actions
accordingly
and
should
it
be
said
that
prudence
may
suffice
to
regulate
our
actions
in
this
particular
without
any
real
pride
i
would
observe
that
here
the
object
of
prudence
is
to
conform
our
actions
to
the
general
usage
and
custom
and
that
it
is
impossible
those
tacit
airs
of
superiority
should
ever
have
been
established
and
authorized
by
custom
unless
men
were
generally
proud
and
unless
that
passion
were
generally
approved
when
if
we
pass
from
common
life
and
conversation
to
history
this
reasoning
acquires
new
force
when
we
observe
that
all
those
great
actions
and
sentiments
which
have
become
the
admiration
of
mankind
are
founded
on
nothing
but
pride
and
go
says
alexander
the
great
to
his
soldiers
when
they
refused
to
follow
him
to
the
indies
go
tell
your
countrymen
that
you
left
alexander
corn
pleating
the
conquest
of
the
world
this
passage
was
always
particularly
admired
by
the
prince
of
conde
as
we
learn
from
st
evremond
alexander
said
that
prince
abandoned
by
his
soldiers
among
barbarians
not
yet
fully
subdued
felt
in
himself
such
a
dignity
of
right
and
of
empire
that
he
coued
not
believe
it
possible
any
one
coued
refuse
to
obey
him
whether
in
europe
or
in
asia
among
greeks
or
persians
all
was
indifferent
to
him
wherever
he
found
men
he
fancied
he
found
subjects
in
general
we
may
observe
that
whatever
we
call
heroic
virtue
and
admire
under
the
character
of
greatness
and
elevation
of
mind
is
either
nothing
but
a
steady
and
wellestablished
pride
and
or
partakes
largely
of
that
passion
courage
intrepidity
ambition
love
of
glory
magnanimity
and
all
the
other
shining
virtues
of
that
kind
have
plainly
a
strong
mixture
of
in
them
and
derive
a
great
part
of
their
merit
from
that
origin
accordingly
we
find
that
many
religious
declaimers
decry
those
virtues
as
purely
pagan
and
natural
and
represent
to
us
the
excellency
of
the
christian
religion
which
places
humility
in
the
rank
of
virtues
and
corrects
the
judgment
of
the
world
and
even
of
philosophers
who
so
generally
admire
all
the
efforts
of
pride
and
ambition
whether
this
virtue
of
humility
has
been
rightly
understood
i
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
i
am
content
with
the
concession
that
the
world
naturally
esteems
a
pride
which
secretly
animates
our
conduct
without
breaking
out
into
such
indecent
expressions
of
vanity
as
many
offend
the
vanity
of
others
the
merit
of
pride
or
is
derived
from
two
circumstances
viz
its
utility
and
its
agreeableness
to
ourselves
by
which
it
capacitates
us
for
business
and
at
the
same
time
gives
us
an
immediate
satisfaction
when
it
goes
beyond
its
just
bounds
it
loses
the
first
advantage
and
even
becomes
prejudicial
which
is
the
reason
why
we
condemn
an
extravagant
pride
and
ambition
however
regulated
by
the
decorums
of
and
politeness
but
as
such
a
passion
is
still
agreeable
and
conveys
an
elevated
and
sublime
sensation
to
the
person
who
is
actuated
by
it
the
sympathy
with
that
satisfaction
diminishes
considerably
the
blame
which
naturally
attends
its
dangerous
influence
on
his
conduct
and
behaviour
accordingly
we
may
observe
that
an
excessive
courage
and
magnanimity
especially
when
it
displays
itself
under
the
frowns
of
fortune
contributes
in
a
great
measure
to
the
character
of
a
hero
and
will
render
a
person
the
admiration
of
posterity
at
the
same
time
that
it
ruins
his
affairs
and
leads
him
into
dangers
and
difficulties
with
which
otherwise
he
would
never
have
been
acquainted
heroism
or
military
glory
is
much
admired
by
the
generality
of
mankind
they
consider
it
as
the
most
sublime
kind
of
merit
men
of
cool
reflection
are
not
so
sanguine
in
their
praises
of
it
the
infinite
confusions
and
disorder
which
it
has
caused
in
the
world
diminish
much
of
its
merit
in
their
eyes
when
they
would
oppose
the
popular
notions
on
this
head
they
always
paint
out
the
evils
which
this
supposed
virtue
has
produced
in
human
society
the
subversion
of
empires
the
devastation
of
provinces
the
sack
of
cities
as
long
as
these
are
present
to
us
we
are
more
inclined
to
hate
than
admire
the
ambition
of
heroes
but
when
we
fix
our
view
on
the
person
himself
who
is
the
author
of
all
this
mischief
there
is
something
so
dazzling
in
his
character
the
mere
contemplation
of
it
so
elevates
the
mind
that
we
can
not
refuse
it
our
admiration
the
pain
which
we
receive
from
its
tendency
to
the
prejudice
of
society
is
by
a
stronger
and
more
immediate
sympathy
thus
our
explication
of
the
merit
or
demerit
which
attends
the
degrees
of
pride
or
may
serve
as
a
strong
argument
for
the
preceding
hypothesis
by
shewing
the
effects
of
those
principles
above
explained
in
all
the
variations
of
our
judgments
concerning
that
passion
nor
will
this
reasoning
be
advantageous
to
us
only
by
shewing
that
the
distinction
of
vice
and
virtue
arises
from
the
four
principles
of
the
advantage
and
of
the
pleasure
of
the
person
himself
and
of
others
but
may
also
afford
us
a
strong
proof
of
some
of
that
hypothesis
no
one
who
duly
considers
of
this
matter
will
make
any
scruple
of
allowing
that
any
piece
of
or
any
expression
of
pride
and
haughtiness
is
displeasing
to
us
merely
because
it
shocks
our
own
pride
and
leads
us
by
sympathy
into
a
comparison
which
causes
the
disagreeable
passion
of
humility
now
as
an
insolence
of
this
kind
is
blamed
even
in
a
person
who
has
always
been
civil
to
ourselves
in
particular
nay
in
one
whose
name
is
only
known
to
us
in
history
it
follows
that
our
disapprobation
proceeds
from
a
sympathy
with
others
and
from
the
reflection
that
such
a
character
is
highly
displeasing
and
odious
to
every
one
who
converses
or
has
any
intercourse
with
the
person
possest
of
it
we
sympathize
with
those
people
in
their
uneasiness
and
as
their
uneasiness
proceeds
in
part
from
a
sympathy
with
the
person
who
insults
them
we
may
here
observe
a
double
rebound
of
the
sympathy
which
is
a
principle
very
similar
to
what
we
have
observed
book

part

sect
iii
of
goodness
and
benevolence
having
thus
explained
the
origin
of
that
praise
and
approbation
which
attends
every
thing
we
call
great
in
human
affections
we
now
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
their
goodness
and
shew
whence
its
merit
is
derived
when
experience
has
once
given
us
a
competent
knowledge
of
human
affairs
and
has
taught
us
the
proportion
they
bear
to
human
passion
we
perceive
that
the
generosity
of
men
is
very
limited
and
that
it
seldom
extends
beyond
their
friends
and
family
or
at
most
beyond
their
native
country
being
thus
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
man
we
expect
not
any
impossibilities
from
him
but
confine
our
view
to
that
narrow
circle
in
which
any
person
moves
in
order
to
form
a
judgment
of
his
moral
character
when
the
natural
tendency
of
his
passions
leads
him
to
be
serviceable
and
useful
within
his
sphere
we
approve
of
his
character
and
love
his
person
by
a
sympathy
with
the
sentiments
of
those
who
have
a
more
particular
connexion
with
him
we
are
quickly
obliged
to
forget
our
own
interest
in
our
judgments
of
this
kind
by
reason
of
the
perpetual
contradictions
we
meet
with
in
society
and
conversation
from
persons
that
are
not
placed
in
the
same
situation
and
have
not
the
same
interest
with
ourselves
the
only
point
of
view
in
which
our
sentiments
concur
with
those
of
others
is
when
we
consider
the
tendency
of
any
passion
to
the
advantage
or
harm
of
those
who
have
any
immediate
connexion
or
intercourse
with
the
person
possessed
of
it
and
though
this
advantage
or
harm
be
often
very
remote
from
ourselves
yet
sometimes
it
is
very
near
us
and
interests
us
strongly
by
sympathy
this
concern
we
readily
extend
to
other
cases
that
are
resembling
and
when
these
are
very
remote
our
sympathy
is
proportionably
weaker
and
our
praise
or
blame
fainter
and
more
doubtful
the
case
is
here
the
same
as
in
our
judgments
concerning
external
bodies
all
objects
seem
to
diminish
by
their
distance
but
though
the
appearance
of
objects
to
our
senses
be
the
original
standard
by
which
we
judge
of
them
yet
we
do
not
say
that
they
actually
diminish
by
the
distance
but
correcting
the
appearance
by
reflection
arrive
at
a
more
constant
and
established
judgment
concerning
them
in
like
manner
though
sympathy
be
much
fainter
than
our
concern
for
ourselves
and
a
sympathy
with
persons
remote
from
us
much
fainter
than
that
with
persons
near
and
contiguous
yet
we
neglect
all
these
differences
in
our
calm
judgments
concerning
the
characters
of
men
besides
that
we
ourselves
often
change
our
situation
in
this
particular
we
every
day
meet
with
persons
who
are
in
a
different
situation
from
ourselves
and
who
coued
never
converse
with
us
on
any
reasonable
terms
were
we
to
remain
constantly
in
that
situation
and
point
of
view
which
is
peculiar
to
us
the
intercourse
of
sentiments
therefore
in
society
and
conversation
makes
us
form
some
general
inalterable
standard
by
which
we
may
approve
or
disapprove
of
characters
and
manners
and
though
the
heart
does
not
always
take
part
with
those
general
notions
or
regulate
its
love
and
hatred
by
them
yet
are
they
sufficient
for
discourse
and
serve
all
our
purposes
m
company
in
the
pulpit
on
the
theatre
and
in
the
schools
from
these
principles
we
may
easily
account
for
that
merit
which
is
commonly
ascribed
to
generosity
humanity
compassion
gratitude
friendship
fidelity
zeal
disinterestedness
liberality
and
all
those
other
qualities
which
form
the
character
of
good
and
benevolent
a
propensity
to
the
tender
passions
makes
a
man
agreeable
and
useful
in
all
the
parts
of
life
and
gives
a
just
direction
to
all
his
other
quailties
which
otherwise
may
become
prejudicial
to
society
courage
and
ambition
when
not
regulated
by
benevolence
are
fit
only
to
make
a
tyrant
and
public
robber
it
is
the
same
case
with
judgment
and
capacity
and
all
the
qualities
of
that
kind
they
are
indifferent
in
themselves
to
the
interests
of
society
and
have
a
tendency
to
the
good
or
ill
of
mankind
according
as
they
are
directed
by
these
other
passions
as
love
is
immediately
agreeable
to
the
person
who
is
actuated
by
it
and
hatred
immediately
disagreeable
this
may
also
be
a
considerable
reason
why
we
praise
all
the
passions
that
partake
of
the
former
and
blame
all
those
that
have
any
considerable
share
of
the
latter
it
is
certain
we
are
infinitely
touched
with
a
tender
sentiment
as
well
as
with
a
great
one
the
tears
naturally
start
in
our
eyes
at
the
conception
of
it
nor
can
we
forbear
giving
a
loose
to
the
same
tenderness
towards
the
person
who
exerts
it
all
this
seems
to
me
a
proof
that
our
approbation
has
in
those
cases
an
origin
different
from
the
prospect
of
utility
and
advantage
either
to
ourselves
or
others
to
which
we
may
add
that
men
naturally
without
reflection
approve
of
that
character
which
is
most
like
their
own
the
man
of
a
mild
disposition
and
tender
affections
in
forming
a
notion
of
the
most
perfect
virtue
mixes
in
it
more
of
benevolence
and
humanity
than
the
man
of
courage
and
enterprize
who
naturally
looks
upon
a
certain
elevation
of
mind
as
the
most
accomplished
character
this
must
evidently
proceed
from
an
immediate
sympathy
which
men
have
with
characters
similar
to
their
own
they
enter
with
more
warmth
into
such
sentiments
and
feel
more
sensibly
the
pleasure
which
arises
from
them
it
is
remarkable
that
nothing
touches
a
man
of
humanity
more
than
any
instance
of
extraordinary
delicacy
in
love
or
friendship
where
a
person
is
attentive
to
the
smallest
concerns
of
his
friend
and
is
willing
to
sacrifice
to
them
the
most
considerable
interest
of
his
own
such
delicacies
have
little
influence
on
society
because
they
make
us
regard
the
greatest
trifles
but
they
are
the
more
engaging
the
more
minute
the
concern
is
and
are
a
proof
of
the
highest
merit
in
any
one
who
is
capable
of
them
the
passions
are
so
contagious
that
they
pass
with
the
greatest
facility
from
one
person
to
another
and
produce
correspondent
movements
in
all
human
breasts
where
friendship
appears
in
very
signal
instances
my
heart
catches
the
same
passion
and
is
warmed
by
those
warm
sentiments
that
display
themselves
before
me
such
agreeable
movements
must
give
me
an
affection
to
every
one
that
excites
them
this
is
the
case
with
every
thing
that
is
agreeable
in
any
person
the
transition
from
pleasure
to
love
is
easy
but
the
transition
must
here
be
still
more
easy
since
the
agreeable
sentiment
which
is
excited
by
sympathy
is
love
itself
and
there
is
nothing
required
but
to
change
the
object
hence
the
peculiar
merit
of
benevolence
in
all
its
shapes
and
appearances
hence
even
its
weaknesses
are
virtuous
and
amiable
and
a
person
whose
grief
upon
the
loss
of
a
friend
were
excessive
would
be
esteemed
upon
that
account
his
tenderness
bestows
a
merit
as
it
does
a
pleasure
on
his
melancholy
we
are
not
however
to
imagine
that
all
the
angry
passions
are
vicious
though
they
are
disagreeable
there
is
a
certain
indulgence
due
to
human
nature
in
this
respect
anger
and
hatred
are
passions
inherent
in
our
very
frame
and
constitutions
the
want
of
them
on
some
occasions
may
even
be
a
proof
of
weakness
and
imbecillity
and
where
they
appear
only
in
a
low
degree
we
not
only
excuse
them
because
they
are
natural
but
even
bestow
our
applauses
on
them
because
they
are
inferior
to
what
appears
in
the
greatest
part
of
mankind
where
these
angry
passions
rise
up
to
cruelty
they
form
the
most
detested
of
all
vices
all
the
pity
and
concern
which
we
have
for
the
miserable
sufferers
by
this
vice
turns
against
the
person
guilty
of
it
and
produces
a
stronger
hatred
than
we
are
sensible
of
on
any
other
occasion
even
when
the
vice
of
inhumanity
rises
not
to
this
extreme
degree
our
sentiments
concerning
it
are
very
much
influenced
by
reflections
on
the
harm
that
results
from
it
and
we
may
observe
in
general
that
if
we
can
find
any
quality
in
a
person
which
renders
him
incommodious
to
those
who
live
and
converse
with
him
we
always
allow
it
to
be
a
fault
or
blemish
without
any
farther
examination
on
the
other
hand
when
we
enumerate
the
good
qualities
of
any
person
we
always
mention
those
parts
of
his
character
which
render
him
a
safe
companion
an
easy
friend
a
gentle
master
an
agreeable
husband
or
an
indulgent
father
we
consider
him
with
all
his
relations
in
society
and
love
or
hate
him
according
as
he
affects
those
who
have
any
immediate
intercourse
with
him
and
it
is
a
most
certain
rule
that
if
there
be
no
relation
of
life
in
which
i
coued
not
wish
to
stand
to
a
particular
person
his
character
must
so
far
be
allowed
to
be
perfect
if
he
be
as
little
wanting
to
himself
as
to
others
his
character
is
entirely
perfect
this
is
the
ultimate
test
of
merit
and
virtue
sect
iv
of
natural
abilities
no
distinction
is
more
usual
in
all
systems
of
ethics
than
that
betwixt
natural
abilities
and
moral
virtues
where
the
former
are
placed
on
the
same
footing
with
bodily
endowments
and
are
supposed
to
have
no
merit
or
moral
worth
annexed
to
them
whoever
considers
the
matter
accurately
will
find
that
a
dispute
upon
this
head
would
be
merely
a
dispute
of
words
and
that
though
these
qualities
are
not
altogether
of
the
same
kind
yet
they
agree
in
the
most
material
circumstances
they
are
both
of
them
equally
mental
qualities
and
both
of
them
equally
produce
pleasure
and
have
of
course
an
equal
tendency
to
procure
the
love
and
esteem
of
mankind
there
are
few
who
are
not
as
jealous
of
their
character
with
regard
to
sense
and
knowledge
as
to
honour
and
courage
and
much
more
than
with
regard
to
temperance
and
sobriety
men
are
even
afraid
of
passing
for
goodnatured
lest
that
should
be
taken
for
want
of
understanding
and
often
boast
of
more
debauches
than
they
have
been
really
engaged
in
to
give
themselves
airs
of
fire
and
spirit
in
short
the
figure
a
man
makes
in
the
world
the
reception
he
meets
with
in
company
the
esteem
paid
him
by
his
acquaintance
all
these
advantages
depend
almost
as
much
upon
his
good
sense
and
judgment
as
upon
any
other
part
of
his
character
let
a
man
have
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
and
be
the
farthest
from
all
injustice
and
violence
he
will
never
be
able
to
make
himself
be
much
regarded
without
a
moderate
share
at
least
of
parts
and
understanding
since
then
natural
abilities
though
perhaps
inferior
yet
are
on
the
same
footing
both
as
to
their
causes
and
effects
with
those
qualities
which
we
call
moral
virtues
why
should
we
make
any
distinction
betwixt
them
though
we
refuse
to
natural
abilities
the
title
of
virtues
we
must
allow
that
they
procure
the
love
and
esteem
of
mankind
that
they
give
a
new
lustre
to
the
other
virtues
and
that
a
man
possessed
of
them
is
much
more
intitled
to
our
and
services
than
one
entirely
void
of
them
it
may
indeed
be
pretended
that
the
sentiment
of
approbation
which
those
qualities
produce
besides
its
being
inferior
is
also
somewhat
different
from
that
which
attends
the
other
virtues
but
this
in
my
opinion
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
excluding
them
from
the
catalogue
of
virtues
each
of
the
virtues
even
benevolence
justice
gratitude
integrity
excites
a
different
sentiment
or
feeling
in
the
spectator
the
characters
of
caesar
and
cato
as
drawn
by
sallust
are
both
of
them
virtuous
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
but
in
a
different
way
nor
are
the
sentiments
entirely
the
same
which
arise
from
them
the
one
produces
love
the
other
esteem
the
one
is
amiable
the
other
awful
we
could
wish
to
meet
with
the
one
character
in
a
friend
the
other
character
we
would
be
ambitious
of
in
ourselves
in
like
manner
the
approbation
which
attends
natural
abilities
may
be
somewhat
different
to
the
feeling
from
that
which
arises
from
the
other
virtues
without
making
them
entirely
of
a
different
species
and
indeed
we
may
observe
that
the
natural
abilities
no
more
than
the
other
virtues
produce
not
all
of
them
the
same
kind
of
approbation
good
sense
and
genius
beget
esteem
wit
and
humour
excite
love
footnote
love
and
esteem
are
at
the
bottom
the
same
passions
and
arise
from
like
causes
the
qualities
that
produce
both
are
agreeable
and
give
pleasure
but
where
this
pleasure
is
severe
and
serious
or
where
its
object
is
great
and
makes
a
strong
impression
or
where
it
produces
any
degree
of
humility
and
awe
in
all
these
cases
the
passion
which
arises
from
the
pleasure
is
more
properly
denominated
esteem
than
love
benevolence
attends
both
but
is
connected
with
love
in
a
more
eminent
degree
those
who
represent
the
distinction
betwixt
natural
abilities
and
moral
virtues
as
very
material
may
say
that
the
former
are
entirely
involuntary
and
have
therefore
no
merit
attending
them
as
having
no
dependance
on
liberty
and
but
to
this
i
answer
first
that
many
of
those
qualities
which
all
moralists
especially
the
antients
comprehend
under
the
title
of
moral
virtues
are
equally
involuntary
and
necessary
with
the
qualities
of
the
judgment
and
imagination
of
this
nature
are
constancy
fortitude
magnanimity
and
in
short
all
the
qualities
which
form
the
great
man
i
might
say
the
same
in
some
degree
of
the
others
it
being
almost
impossible
for
the
mind
to
change
its
character
in
any
considerable
article
or
cure
itself
of
a
passionate
or
splenetic
temper
when
they
are
natural
to
it
the
greater
degree
there
is
of
these
blameable
qualities
the
more
vicious
they
become
and
yet
they
are
the
less
voluntary
secondly
i
would
have
anyone
give
me
a
reason
why
virtue
and
vice
may
not
be
involuntary
as
well
as
beauty
and
deformity
these
moral
distinctions
arise
from
the
natural
distinctions
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
when
we
receive
those
feelings
from
the
general
consideration
of
any
quality
or
character
we
denominate
it
vicious
or
virtuous
now
i
believe
no
one
will
assert
that
a
quality
can
never
produce
pleasure
or
pain
to
the
person
who
considers
it
unless
it
be
perfectly
voluntary
in
the
person
who
possesses
it
thirdly
as
to
we
have
shewn
that
it
has
no
place
with
regard
to
the
actions
no
more
than
the
qualities
of
men
it
is
not
a
just
consequence
that
what
is
voluntary
is
free
our
actions
are
more
voluntary
than
our
judgments
but
we
have
not
more
liberty
in
the
one
than
in
the
other
but
though
this
distinction
betwixt
voluntary
and
involuntary
be
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
distinction
betwixt
natural
abilities
and
moral
virtues
yet
the
former
distinction
will
afford
us
a
plausible
reason
why
moralists
have
invented
the
latter
men
have
observed
that
though
natural
abilities
and
moral
qualities
be
in
the
main
on
the
same
footing
there
is
however
this
difference
betwixt
them
that
the
former
are
almost
invariable
by
any
art
or
industry
while
the
latter
or
at
least
the
actions
that
proceed
from
them
may
be
changed
by
the
motives
of
rewards
and
punishments
praise
and
blame
hence
legislators
and
divines
and
moralists
have
principally
applied
themselves
to
the
regulating
these
voluntary
actions
and
have
endeavoured
to
produce
additional
motives
for
being
virtuous
in
that
particular
they
knew
that
to
punish
a
man
for
folly
or
exhort
him
to
be
prudent
and
sagacious
would
have
but
little
effect
though
the
same
punishments
and
exhortations
with
regard
to
justice
and
injustice
might
have
a
considerable
influence
but
as
men
in
common
life
and
conversation
do
not
carry
those
ends
in
view
but
naturally
praise
or
blame
whatever
pleases
or
displeases
them
they
do
not
seem
much
to
regard
this
distinction
but
consider
prudence
under
the
character
of
virtue
as
well
as
benevolence
and
penetration
as
well
as
justice
nay
we
find
that
all
moralists
whose
judgment
is
not
perverted
by
a
strict
adherence
to
a
system
enter
into
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
that
the
antient
moralists
in
particular
made
no
scruple
of
placing
prudence
at
the
head
of
the
cardinal
virtues
there
is
a
sentiment
of
esteem
and
approbation
which
may
be
excited
in
some
degree
by
any
faculty
of
the
mind
in
its
perfect
state
and
condition
and
to
account
for
this
sentiment
is
the
business
of
philosophers
it
belongs
to
grammarians
to
examine
what
qualities
are
entitled
to
the
denomination
of
virtue
nor
will
they
find
upon
trial
that
this
is
so
easy
a
task
as
at
first
sight
they
may
be
apt
to
imagine
the
principal
reason
why
natural
abilities
are
esteemed
is
because
of
their
tendency
to
be
useful
to
the
person
who
is
possessed
of
them
it
is
impossible
to
execute
any
design
with
success
where
it
is
not
conducted
with
prudence
and
discretion
nor
will
the
goodness
of
our
intentions
alone
suffice
to
procure
us
a
happy
issue
to
our
enterprizes
men
are
superior
to
beasts
principally
by
the
superiority
of
their
reason
and
they
are
the
degrees
of
the
same
faculty
which
set
such
an
infinite
difference
betwixt
one
man
and
another
all
the
advantages
of
art
are
owing
to
human
reason
and
where
fortune
is
not
very
capricious
the
most
considerable
part
of
these
advantages
must
fall
to
the
share
of
the
prudent
and
sagacious
when
it
is
asked
whether
a
quick
or
a
slow
apprehension
be
most
valuable
whether
one
that
at
first
view
penetrates
into
a
subject
but
can
perform
nothing
upon
study
or
a
contrary
character
which
must
work
out
every
thing
by
dint
of
application
whether
a
clear
head
or
a
copious
invention
whether
a
profound
genius
or
a
sure
judgment
in
short
what
character
or
peculiar
understanding
is
more
excellent
than
another
it
is
evident
we
can
answer
none
of
these
questions
without
considering
which
of
those
qualities
capacitates
a
man
best
for
the
world
and
carries
him
farthest
in
any
of
his
undertakings
there
are
many
other
qualities
of
the
mind
whose
merit
is
derived
from
the
same
origin
industry
perseverance
patience
activity
vigilance
application
constancy
with
other
virtues
of
that
kind
which
it
will
be
easy
to
recollect
are
esteemed
valuable
upon
no
other
account
than
their
advantage
in
the
conduct
of
life
it
is
the
same
case
with
temperance
frugality
economy
resolution
as
on
the
other
hand
prodigality
luxury
irresolution
uncertainty
are
vicious
merely
because
they
draw
ruin
upon
us
and
incapacitate
us
for
business
and
action
as
wisdom
and
are
valued
because
they
are
useful
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
so
wit
and
eloquence
are
valued
because
they
are
immediately
agreeable
to
others
on
the
other
hand
good
humour
is
loved
and
esteemed
because
it
is
immediately
agreeable
to
the
person
himself
it
is
evident
that
the
conversation
of
a
man
of
wit
is
very
satisfactory
as
a
chearful
companion
diffuses
a
joy
over
the
whole
company
from
a
sympathy
with
his
gaiety
these
qualities
therefore
being
agreeable
they
naturally
beget
love
and
esteem
and
answer
to
all
the
characters
of
virtue
it
is
difficult
to
tell
on
many
occasions
what
it
is
that
renders
one
man
conversation
so
agreeable
and
entertaining
and
another
so
insipid
and
distasteful
as
conversation
is
a
transcript
of
the
mind
as
well
as
books
the
same
qualities
which
render
the
one
valuable
must
give
us
an
esteem
for
the
other
this
we
shall
consider
afterwards
in
the
mean
time
it
may
be
affirmed
in
general
that
all
the
merit
a
man
may
derive
from
his
conversation
which
no
doubt
may
be
very
considerable
arises
from
nothing
but
the
pleasure
it
conveys
to
those
who
are
present
in
this
view
cleanliness
is
also
to
be
regarded
as
a
virtue
since
it
naturally
renders
us
agreeable
to
others
and
is
a
very
considerable
source
of
love
and
affection
no
one
will
deny
that
a
negligence
in
this
particular
is
a
fault
and
as
faults
are
nothing
but
smaller
vices
and
this
fault
can
have
no
other
origin
than
the
uneasy
sensation
which
it
excites
in
others
we
may
in
this
instance
seemingly
so
trivial
dearly
discover
the
origin
of
the
moral
distinction
of
vice
and
virtue
in
other
instances
besides
all
those
qualities
which
render
a
person
lovely
or
valuable
there
is
also
a
certain
of
agreeable
and
handsome
that
concurs
to
the
same
effect
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
that
of
wit
and
eloquence
we
must
have
recourse
to
a
certain
sense
which
acts
without
reflection
and
regards
not
the
tendencies
of
qualities
and
characters
some
moralists
account
for
all
the
sentiments
of
virtue
by
this
sense
their
hypothesis
is
very
plausible
nothing
but
a
particular
enquiry
can
give
the
preference
to
any
other
hypothesis
when
we
find
that
almost
all
the
virtues
have
such
particular
tendencies
and
also
find
that
these
tendencies
are
sufficient
alone
to
give
a
strong
sentiment
of
approbation
we
can
not
doubt
after
this
that
qualities
are
approved
of
in
proportion
to
the
advantage
which
results
from
them
the
decorum
or
indecorum
of
a
quality
with
regard
to
the
age
or
character
or
station
contributes
also
to
its
praise
or
blame
this
decorum
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
experience
it
is
usual
to
see
men
lose
their
levity
as
they
advance
in
years
such
a
degree
of
gravity
therefore
and
such
years
are
connected
together
in
our
thoughts
when
we
observe
them
separated
in
any
person
character
this
imposes
a
kind
of
violence
on
our
imagination
and
is
disagreeable
that
faculty
of
the
soul
which
of
all
others
is
of
the
least
consequence
to
the
character
and
has
the
least
virtue
or
vice
in
its
several
degrees
at
the
same
time
that
it
admits
of
a
great
variety
of
degrees
is
the
memory
unless
it
rise
up
to
that
stupendous
height
as
to
surprize
us
or
sink
so
low
as
in
some
measure
to
affect
the
judgment
we
commonly
take
no
notice
of
its
variations
nor
ever
mention
them
to
the
praise
or
dispraise
of
any
person
it
is
so
far
from
being
a
virtue
to
have
a
good
memory
that
men
generally
affect
to
complain
of
a
bad
one
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
the
world
that
what
they
say
is
entirely
of
their
own
invention
sacrifice
it
to
the
praise
of
genius
and
judgment
yet
to
consider
the
matter
abstractedly
it
would
be
difficult
to
give
a
reason
why
the
faculty
of
recalling
past
ideas
with
truth
and
clearness
should
not
have
as
much
merit
in
it
as
the
faculty
of
placing
our
present
ideas
in
such
an
order
as
to
form
true
propositions
and
opinions
the
reason
of
the
difference
certainly
must
be
that
the
memory
is
exerted
without
any
sensation
of
pleasure
or
pain
and
in
all
its
middling
degrees
serves
almost
equally
well
in
business
and
affairs
but
the
least
variations
in
the
judgment
are
sensibly
felt
in
their
consequences
while
at
the
same
time
that
faculty
is
never
exerted
in
any
eminent
degree
without
an
extraordinary
delight
and
satisfaction
the
sympathy
with
this
utility
and
pleasure
bestows
a
merit
on
the
understanding
and
the
absence
of
it
makes
us
consider
the
memory
as
a
faculty
very
indifferent
to
blame
or
praise
before
i
leave
this
subject
of
natural
abilities
i
must
observe
that
perhaps
one
source
of
the
esteem
and
affection
which
attends
them
is
derived
from
the
importance
and
weight
which
they
bestow
on
the
person
possessed
of
them
he
becomes
of
greater
consequence
in
life
his
resolutions
and
actions
affect
a
greater
number
of
his
both
his
friendship
and
enmity
are
of
moment
and
it
is
easy
to
observe
that
whoever
is
elevated
after
this
manner
above
the
rest
of
mankind
must
excite
in
us
the
sentiments
of
esteem
and
approbation
whatever
is
important
engages
our
attention
fixes
our
thought
and
is
contemplated
with
satisfaction
the
histories
of
kingdoms
are
more
interesting
than
domestic
stories
the
histories
of
great
empires
more
than
those
of
small
cities
and
principalities
and
the
histories
of
wars
and
revolutions
more
than
those
of
peace
and
order
we
sympathize
with
the
persons
that
suffer
in
all
the
various
sentiments
which
belong
to
their
fortunes
the
mind
is
occupied
by
the
multitude
of
the
objects
and
by
the
strong
passions
that
display
themselves
and
this
occupation
or
agitation
of
the
mind
is
commonly
agreeable
and
amusing
the
same
theory
accounts
for
the
esteem
and
regard
we
pay
to
men
of
extraordinary
parts
and
abilities
the
good
and
ill
of
multitudes
are
connected
with
their
actions
whatever
they
undertake
is
important
and
challenges
our
attention
nothing
is
to
be
and
despised
that
regards
them
and
where
any
person
can
excite
these
sentiments
he
soon
acquires
our
esteem
unless
other
circumstances
of
his
character
render
him
odious
and
disagreeable
sect
v
some
farther
reflections
concerning
the
natural
virtues
it
has
been
observed
in
treating
of
the
passions
that
pride
and
humility
love
and
hatred
are
excited
by
any
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
the
mind
body
or
fortune
and
that
these
advantages
or
disadvantages
have
that
effect
by
producing
a
separate
impression
of
pain
or
pleasure
the
pain
or
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
general
survey
or
view
of
any
action
or
quality
of
the
mind
constitutes
its
vice
or
virtue
and
gives
rise
to
our
approbation
or
blame
which
is
nothing
but
a
fainter
and
more
imperceptible
love
or
hatred
we
have
assigned
four
different
sources
of
this
pain
and
pleasure
and
in
order
to
justify
more
fully
that
hypothesis
it
may
here
be
proper
to
observe
that
the
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
the
body
and
of
fortune
produce
a
pain
or
pleasure
from
the
very
same
principles
the
tendency
of
any
object
to
be
useful
to
the
person
possess
d
of
it
or
to
others
to
convey
pleasure
to
him
or
to
others
all
these
circumstances
convey
an
immediate
pleasure
to
the
person
who
considers
the
object
and
command
his
love
and
approbation
to
begin
with
the
advantages
of
the
body
we
may
observe
a
phaenomenon
which
might
appear
somewhat
trivial
and
ludicrous
if
any
thing
coued
be
trivial
which
fortified
a
conclusion
of
such
importance
or
ludicrous
which
was
employed
in
a
philosophical
reasoning
it
is
a
general
remark
that
those
we
call
good
women
men
who
have
either
signalized
themselves
by
their
amorous
exploits
or
whose
make
of
body
promises
any
extraordinary
vigour
of
that
kind
are
well
received
by
the
fair
sex
and
naturally
engage
the
affections
even
of
those
whose
virtue
prevents
any
design
of
ever
giving
employment
to
those
talents
here
it
is
evident
that
the
ability
of
such
a
person
to
give
enjoyment
is
the
real
source
of
that
love
and
esteem
he
meets
with
among
the
females
at
the
same
time
that
the
women
who
love
and
esteem
him
have
no
prospect
of
receiving
that
enjoyment
themselves
and
can
only
be
affected
by
means
of
their
sympathy
with
one
that
has
a
commerce
of
love
with
him
this
instance
is
singular
and
merits
our
attention
another
source
of
the
pleasure
we
receive
from
considering
bodily
advantages
is
their
utility
to
the
person
himself
who
is
possessed
of
them
it
is
certain
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
beauty
of
men
as
well
as
of
other
animals
consists
in
such
a
conformation
of
members
as
we
find
by
experience
to
be
attended
with
strength
and
agility
and
to
capacitate
the
creature
for
any
action
or
exercise
broad
shoulders
a
lank
belly
firm
joints
taper
legs
all
these
are
beautiful
in
our
species
because
they
are
signs
of
force
and
vigour
which
being
advantages
we
naturally
sympathize
with
they
convey
to
the
beholder
a
share
of
that
satisfaction
they
produce
in
the
possessor
so
far
as
to
the
utility
which
may
attend
any
quality
of
the
body
as
to
the
immediate
pleasure
it
is
certain
that
an
air
of
health
as
well
as
of
strength
and
agility
makes
a
considerable
part
of
beauty
and
that
a
sickly
air
in
another
is
always
disagreeable
upon
account
of
that
idea
of
pain
and
uneasiness
which
it
conveys
to
us
on
the
other
hand
we
are
pleased
with
the
regularity
of
our
own
features
though
it
be
neither
useful
to
ourselves
nor
others
and
it
is
necessary
at
a
distance
to
make
it
convey
to
us
any
satisfaction
we
commonly
consider
ourselves
as
we
appear
in
the
eyes
of
others
and
sympathize
with
the
advantageous
sentiments
they
entertain
with
regard
to
us
how
far
the
advantages
of
fortune
produce
esteem
and
approbation
from
the
same
principles
we
may
satisfy
ourselves
by
reflecting
on
our
precedent
reasoning
on
that
subject
we
have
observed
that
our
approbation
of
those
who
are
possess
d
of
the
advantages
of
fortune
may
be
ascribed
to
three
different
causes
first
to
that
immediate
pleasure
which
a
rich
man
gives
us
by
the
view
of
the
beautiful
cloaths
equipage
gardens
or
houses
which
he
possesses
secondly
to
the
advantage
which
we
hope
to
reap
from
him
by
his
generosity
and
liberality
thirdly
to
the
pleasure
and
advantage
which
he
himself
reaps
from
his
possessions
and
which
produce
an
agreeable
sympathy
in
us
whether
we
ascribe
our
esteem
of
the
rich
and
great
to
one
or
all
of
these
causes
we
may
clearly
see
the
traces
of
those
principles
which
give
rise
to
the
sense
of
vice
and
virtue
i
believe
most
people
at
first
sight
will
be
inclined
to
ascribe
our
esteem
of
the
rich
to
and
the
prospect
of
advantage
but
as
it
is
certain
that
our
esteem
or
deference
extends
beyond
any
prospect
of
advantage
to
ourselves
it
is
evident
that
that
sentiment
must
proceed
from
a
sympathy
with
those
who
are
dependent
on
the
person
we
esteem
and
respect
and
who
have
an
immediate
connexion
with
him
we
consider
him
as
a
person
capable
of
contributing
to
the
happiness
or
enjoyment
of
his
whose
sentiments
with
regard
to
him
we
naturally
embrace
and
this
consideration
will
serve
to
justify
my
hypothesis
in
preferring
the
third
principle
to
the
other
two
and
ascribing
our
esteem
of
the
rich
to
a
sympathy
with
the
pleasure
and
advantage
which
they
themselves
receive
from
their
possessions
for
as
even
the
other
two
principles
can
not
operate
to
a
due
extent
or
account
for
all
the
phaenomena
without
having
recourse
to
a
sympathy
of
one
kind
or
other
it
is
much
more
natural
to
chuse
that
sympathy
which
is
immediate
and
direct
than
that
which
is
remote
and
indirect
to
which
we
may
add
that
where
the
riches
or
power
are
very
great
and
render
the
person
considerable
and
important
in
the
world
the
esteem
attending
them
may
in
part
be
ascribed
to
another
source
distinct
from
these
three
viz
their
interesting
the
mind
by
a
prospect
of
the
multitude
and
importance
of
their
consequences
though
in
order
to
account
for
the
operation
of
this
principle
we
must
also
have
recourse
to
sympathy
as
we
have
observed
in
the
preceding
section
it
may
not
be
amiss
on
this
occasion
to
remark
the
flexibility
of
our
sentiments
and
the
several
changes
they
so
readily
receive
from
the
objects
with
which
they
are
conjoined
all
the
sentiments
of
approbation
which
attend
any
particular
species
of
objects
have
a
great
resemblance
to
each
other
though
derived
from
different
sources
and
on
the
other
hand
those
sentiments
when
directed
to
different
objects
are
different
to
the
feeling
though
derived
from
the
same
source
thus
the
beauty
of
all
visible
objects
causes
a
pleasure
pretty
much
the
same
though
it
be
sometimes
derived
from
the
mere
species
and
appearance
of
the
objects
sometimes
from
sympathy
and
an
idea
of
their
utility
in
like
manner
whenever
we
survey
the
actions
and
characters
of
men
without
any
particular
interest
in
them
the
pleasure
or
pain
which
arises
from
the
survey
with
some
minute
differences
is
in
the
main
of
the
same
kind
though
perhaps
there
be
a
great
diversity
in
the
causes
from
which
it
is
derived
on
the
other
hand
a
convenient
house
and
a
virtuous
character
cause
not
the
same
feeling
of
approbation
even
though
the
source
of
our
approbation
be
the
same
and
flow
from
sympathy
and
an
idea
of
their
utility
there
is
something
very
inexplicable
in
this
variation
of
our
feelings
but
it
is
what
we
have
experience
of
with
regard
to
all
our
passions
and
sentiments
sect
vi
conclusion
of
this
book
thus
upon
the
whole
i
am
hopeful
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
an
accurate
proof
of
this
system
of
ethics
we
are
certain
that
sympathy
is
a
very
powerful
principle
in
human
nature
we
are
also
certain
that
it
has
a
great
influence
on
our
sense
of
beauty
when
we
regard
external
objects
as
well
as
when
we
judge
of
morals
we
find
that
it
has
force
sufficient
to
give
us
the
strongest
sentiments
of
approbation
when
it
operates
alone
without
the
concurrence
of
any
other
principle
as
in
the
cases
of
justice
allegiance
chastity
and
we
may
observe
that
all
the
circumstances
requisite
for
its
operation
are
found
in
most
of
the
virtues
which
have
for
the
most
part
a
tendency
to
the
good
of
society
or
to
that
of
the
person
possessed
of
them
if
we
compare
all
these
circumstances
we
shall
not
doubt
that
sympathy
is
the
chief
source
of
moral
distinctions
especially
when
we
reflect
that
no
objection
can
be
raised
against
this
hypothesis
in
one
case
which
will
not
extend
to
all
cases
justice
is
certainly
approved
of
for
no
other
reason
than
because
it
has
a
tendency
to
the
public
good
and
the
public
good
is
indifferent
to
us
except
so
far
as
sympathy
interests
us
in
it
we
may
presume
the
like
with
regard
to
all
the
other
virtues
which
have
a
like
tendency
to
the
public
good
they
must
derive
all
their
merit
from
our
sympathy
with
those
who
reap
any
advantage
from
them
as
the
virtues
which
have
a
tendency
to
the
good
of
the
person
possessed
of
them
derive
their
merit
from
our
sympathy
with
him
most
people
will
readily
allow
that
the
useful
qualities
of
the
mind
are
virtuous
because
of
their
utility
this
way
of
thinking
is
so
natural
and
occurs
on
so
many
occasions
that
few
will
make
any
scruple
of
admitting
it
now
this
being
once
admitted
the
force
of
sympathy
must
necessarily
be
acknowledged
virtue
is
considered
as
means
to
an
end
means
to
an
end
are
only
valued
so
far
as
the
end
is
valued
but
the
happiness
of
strangers
affects
us
by
sympathy
alone
to
that
principle
therefore
we
are
to
ascribe
the
sentiment
of
approbation
which
arises
from
the
survey
of
all
those
virtues
that
are
useful
to
society
or
to
the
person
possessed
of
them
these
form
the
most
considerable
part
of
morality
were
it
proper
in
such
a
subject
to
bribe
the
reader
assent
or
employ
any
thing
but
solid
argument
we
are
here
abundantly
supplied
with
topics
to
engage
the
affections
all
lovers
of
virtue
and
such
we
all
are
in
speculation
however
we
may
degenerate
in
practice
must
certainly
be
pleased
to
see
moral
distinctions
derived
from
so
noble
a
source
which
gives
us
a
just
notion
both
of
the
generosity
and
capacity
of
human
nature
it
requires
but
very
little
knowledge
of
human
affairs
to
perceive
that
a
sense
of
morals
is
a
principle
inherent
in
the
soul
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
that
enters
into
the
composition
but
this
sense
must
certainly
acquire
new
force
when
reflecting
on
itself
it
approves
of
those
principles
from
whence
it
is
derived
and
finds
nothing
but
what
is
great
and
good
in
its
rise
and
origin
those
who
resolve
the
sense
of
morals
into
original
instincts
of
the
human
mind
may
defend
the
cause
of
virtue
with
sufficient
authority
but
want
the
advantage
which
those
possess
who
account
for
that
sense
by
an
extensive
sympathy
with
mankind
according
to
their
system
not
only
virtue
must
be
approved
of
but
also
the
sense
of
virtue
and
not
only
that
sense
but
also
the
principles
from
whence
it
is
derived
so
that
nothing
is
presented
on
any
side
but
what
is
laudable
and
good
this
observation
may
be
extended
to
justice
and
the
other
virtues
of
that
kind
though
justice
be
artificial
the
sense
of
its
morality
is
natural
it
is
the
combination
of
men
in
a
system
of
conduct
which
renders
any
act
of
justice
beneficial
to
society
but
when
once
it
has
that
tendency
we
naturally
approve
of
it
and
if
we
did
not
so
it
is
impossible
any
combination
or
convention
coued
ever
produce
that
sentiment
most
of
the
inventions
of
men
are
subject
to
change
they
depend
upon
humour
and
caprice
they
have
a
vogue
for
a
time
and
then
sink
into
oblivion
it
may
perhaps
be
apprehended
that
if
justice
were
allowed
to
be
a
human
invention
it
must
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
but
the
cases
are
widely
different
the
interest
on
which
justice
is
founded
is
the
greatest
imaginable
and
extends
to
all
times
and
places
it
can
not
possibly
be
served
by
any
other
invention
it
is
obvious
and
discovers
itself
on
the
very
first
formation
of
society
all
these
causes
render
the
rules
of
justice
stedfast
and
immutable
at
least
as
immutable
as
human
nature
and
if
they
were
founded
on
original
instincts
coued
they
have
any
greater
stability
the
same
system
may
help
us
to
form
a
just
notion
of
the
happiness
as
well
as
of
the
dignity
of
virtue
and
may
interest
every
principle
of
our
nature
in
the
embracing
and
cherishing
that
noble
quality
who
indeed
does
not
feel
an
accession
of
alacrity
in
his
pursuits
of
knowledge
and
ability
of
every
kind
when
he
considers
that
besides
the
advantage
which
immediately
result
from
these
acquisitions
they
also
give
him
a
new
lustre
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
and
are
universally
attended
with
esteem
and
approbation
and
who
can
think
any
advantages
of
fortune
a
sufficient
compensation
for
the
least
breach
of
the
social
virtues
when
he
considers
that
not
only
his
character
with
regard
to
others
but
also
his
peace
and
inward
satisfaction
entirely
depend
upon
his
strict
observance
of
them
and
that
a
mind
will
never
be
able
to
bear
its
own
survey
that
has
been
wanting
in
its
part
to
mankind
and
society
but
i
forbear
insisting
on
this
subject
such
reflections
require
a
work
very
different
from
the
genius
of
the
present
the
anatomist
ought
never
to
emulate
the
painter
nor
in
his
accurate
dissections
and
portraitures
of
the
smaller
parts
of
the
human
body
pretend
to
give
his
figures
any
graceful
and
engaging
attitude
or
expression
there
is
even
something
hideous
or
at
least
minute
in
the
views
of
things
which
he
presents
and
it
is
necessary
the
objects
should
be
set
more
at
a
distance
and
be
more
covered
up
from
sight
to
make
them
engaging
to
the
eye
and
imagination
an
anatomist
however
is
admirably
fitted
to
give
advice
to
a
painter
and
it
is
even
impracticable
to
excel
in
the
latter
art
without
the
assistance
of
the
former
we
must
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
parts
their
situation
and
connexion
before
we
can
design
with
any
elegance
or
correctness
and
thus
the
most
abstract
speculations
concerning
human
nature
however
cold
and
unentertaining
become
subservient
to
practical
morality
and
may
render
this
latter
science
more
correct
in
its
precepts
and
more
persuasive
in
its
exhortations
appendix
there
is
nothing
i
would
more
willingly
lay
hold
of
than
an
opportunity
of
confessing
my
errors
and
should
esteem
such
a
return
to
truth
and
reason
to
be
more
honourable
than
the
most
unerring
judgment
a
man
who
is
free
from
mistakes
can
pretend
to
no
praises
except
from
the
justness
of
his
understanding
but
a
man
who
corrects
his
mistakes
shews
at
once
the
justness
of
his
understanding
and
the
candour
and
ingenuity
of
his
temper
i
have
not
yet
been
so
fortunate
as
to
discover
any
very
considerable
mistakes
in
the
reasonings
delivered
in
the
preceding
volumes
except
on
one
article
but
i
have
found
by
experience
that
some
of
my
expressions
have
not
been
so
well
chosen
as
to
guard
against
all
mistakes
in
the
readers
and
it
is
chiefly
to
remedy
this
defect
i
have
subjoined
the
following
appendix
we
can
never
be
induced
to
believe
any
matter
of
fact
except
where
its
cause
or
its
effect
is
present
to
us
but
what
the
nature
is
of
that
belief
which
arises
from
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
few
have
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
themselves
in
my
opinion
this
dilemma
is
inevitable
either
the
belief
is
some
new
idea
such
as
that
of
reality
or
existence
which
we
join
to
the
simple
conception
of
an
object
or
it
is
merely
a
peculiar
feeling
or
sentiment
that
it
is
not
a
new
idea
annexed
to
the
simple
conception
may
be
evinced
from
these
two
arguments
first
we
have
no
abstract
idea
of
existence
distinguishable
and
separable
from
the
idea
of
particular
objects
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
this
idea
of
existence
can
be
annexed
to
the
idea
of
any
object
or
form
the
difference
betwixt
a
simple
conception
and
belief
secondly
the
mind
has
the
command
over
all
its
ideas
and
can
separate
unite
mix
and
vary
them
as
it
pleases
so
that
if
belief
consisted
merely
in
a
new
idea
annexed
to
the
conception
it
would
be
in
a
power
to
believe
what
he
pleased
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
belief
consists
merely
in
a
certain
feeling
or
sentiment
in
something
that
depends
not
on
the
will
but
must
arise
from
certain
determinate
causes
and
principles
of
which
we
are
not
masters
when
we
are
convinced
of
any
matter
of
fact
we
do
nothing
but
conceive
it
along
with
a
certain
feeling
different
from
what
attends
the
mere
reveries
of
the
imagination
and
when
we
express
our
incredulity
concerning
any
fact
we
mean
that
the
arguments
for
the
fact
produce
not
that
feeling
did
not
the
belief
consist
in
a
sentiment
different
from
our
mere
conception
whatever
objects
were
presented
by
the
wildest
imagination
would
be
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
most
established
truths
founded
on
history
and
experience
there
is
nothing
but
the
feeling
or
sentiment
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
this
therefore
being
regarded
as
an
undoubted
truth
that
belief
is
nothing
but
a
peculiar
feeling
different
from
the
simple
conception
the
next
question
that
naturally
occurs
is
what
is
the
nature
of
this
feeling
or
sentiment
and
whether
it
be
analogous
to
any
other
sentiment
of
the
human
mind
this
question
is
important
for
if
it
be
not
analogous
to
any
other
sentiment
we
must
despair
of
explaining
its
causes
and
must
consider
it
as
an
original
principle
of
the
human
mind
if
it
be
analogous
we
may
hope
to
explain
its
causes
from
analogy
and
trace
it
up
to
more
general
principles
now
that
there
is
a
greater
firmness
and
solidity
in
the
conceptions
which
are
the
objects
of
conviction
and
assurance
than
in
the
loose
and
indolent
reveries
of
a
every
one
will
readily
own
they
strike
upon
us
with
more
force
they
are
more
present
to
us
the
mind
has
a
firmer
hold
of
them
and
is
more
actuated
and
moved
by
them
it
acquiesces
in
them
and
in
a
manner
fixes
and
reposes
itself
on
them
in
short
they
approach
nearer
to
the
impressions
which
are
immediately
present
to
us
and
are
therefore
analogous
to
many
other
operations
of
the
mind
there
is
not
in
my
opinion
any
possibility
of
evading
this
conclusion
but
by
asserting
that
belief
beside
the
simple
conception
consists
in
some
impression
or
feeling
distinguishable
from
the
conception
it
does
not
modify
the
conception
and
render
it
more
present
and
intense
it
is
only
annexed
to
it
after
the
same
manner
that
will
and
desire
are
annexed
to
particular
conceptions
of
good
and
pleasure
but
the
following
considerations
will
i
hope
be
sufficient
to
remove
this
hypothesis
first
it
is
directly
contrary
to
experience
and
our
immediate
consciousness
all
men
have
ever
allowed
reasoning
to
be
merely
an
operation
of
our
thoughts
or
ideas
and
however
those
ideas
may
be
varied
to
the
feeling
there
is
nothing
ever
enters
into
our
conclusions
but
ideas
or
our
fainter
conceptions
for
instance
i
hear
at
present
a
person
voice
whom
i
am
acquainted
with
and
this
sound
comes
from
the
next
room
this
impression
of
my
senses
immediately
conveys
my
thoughts
to
the
person
along
with
all
the
surrounding
objects
i
paint
them
out
to
myself
as
existent
at
present
with
the
same
qualities
and
relations
that
i
formerly
knew
them
possessed
of
these
ideas
take
faster
hold
of
my
mind
than
the
ideas
of
an
inchanted
castle
they
are
different
to
the
feeling
but
there
is
no
distinct
or
separate
impression
attending
them
it
is
the
same
case
when
i
recollect
the
several
incidents
of
a
journey
or
the
events
of
any
history
every
particular
fact
is
there
the
object
of
belief
its
idea
is
modified
differently
from
the
loose
reveries
of
a
but
no
distinct
impression
attends
every
distinct
idea
or
conception
of
matter
of
fact
this
is
the
subject
of
plain
experience
if
ever
this
experience
can
be
disputed
on
any
occasion
it
is
when
the
mind
has
been
agitated
with
doubts
and
difficulties
and
afterwards
upon
taking
the
object
in
a
new
point
of
view
or
being
presented
with
a
new
argument
fixes
and
reposes
itself
in
one
settled
conclusion
and
belief
in
this
case
there
is
a
feeling
distinct
and
separate
from
the
conception
the
passage
from
doubt
and
agitation
to
tranquility
and
repose
conveys
a
satisfaction
and
pleasure
to
the
mind
but
take
any
other
case
suppose
i
see
the
legs
and
thighs
of
a
person
in
motion
while
some
interposed
object
conceals
the
rest
of
his
body
here
it
is
certain
the
imagination
spreads
out
the
whole
figure
i
give
him
a
head
and
shoulders
and
breast
and
neck
these
members
i
conceive
and
believe
him
to
be
possessed
of
nothing
can
be
more
evident
than
that
this
whole
operation
is
performed
by
the
thought
or
imagination
alone
the
transition
is
immediate
the
ideas
presently
strike
us
their
customary
connexion
with
the
present
impression
varies
them
and
modifies
them
in
a
certain
manner
but
produces
no
act
of
the
mind
distinct
from
this
peculiarity
of
conception
let
any
one
examine
his
own
mind
and
he
will
evidently
find
this
to
be
the
truth
secondly
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
regard
to
this
distinct
impression
it
must
be
allowed
that
the
mind
has
a
firmer
hold
or
more
steady
conception
of
what
it
takes
to
be
matter
of
fact
than
of
fictions
why
then
look
any
farther
or
multiply
suppositions
without
necessity
thirdly
we
can
explain
the
causes
of
the
firm
conception
but
not
those
of
any
separate
impression
and
not
only
so
but
the
causes
of
the
firm
conception
exhaust
the
whole
subject
and
nothing
is
left
to
produce
any
other
effect
an
inference
concerning
a
matter
of
fact
is
nothing
but
the
idea
of
an
object
that
is
frequently
conjoined
or
is
associated
with
a
present
impression
this
is
the
whole
of
it
every
part
is
requisite
to
explain
from
analogy
the
more
steady
conception
and
nothing
remains
capable
of
producing
any
distinct
impression
fourthly
the
effects
of
belief
in
influencing
the
passions
and
imagination
can
all
be
explained
from
the
firm
conception
and
there
is
no
occasion
to
have
recourse
to
any
other
principle
these
arguments
with
many
others
enumerated
in
the
foregoing
volumes
sufficiently
prove
that
belief
only
modifies
the
idea
or
conception
and
renders
it
different
to
the
feeling
without
producing
any
distinct
impression
thus
upon
a
general
view
of
the
subject
there
appear
to
be
two
questions
of
importance
which
we
may
venture
to
recommend
to
the
consideration
of
philosophers
whether
there
be
any
thing
to
distinguish
belief
from
the
simple
conception
beside
the
feeling
of
sentiment
and
whether
this
feeling
be
any
thing
but
a
firmer
conception
or
a
faster
hold
that
we
take
of
the
object
if
upon
impartial
enquiry
the
same
conclusion
that
i
have
formed
be
assented
to
by
philosophers
the
next
business
is
to
examine
the
analogy
which
there
is
betwixt
belief
and
other
acts
of
the
mind
and
find
the
cause
of
the
firmness
and
strength
of
conception
and
this
i
do
not
esteem
a
difficult
task
the
transition
from
a
present
impression
always
enlivens
and
strengthens
any
idea
when
any
object
is
presented
the
idea
of
its
usual
attendant
immediately
strikes
us
as
something
real
and
solid
it
is
felt
rather
than
conceived
and
approaches
the
impression
from
which
it
is
derived
in
its
force
and
influence
this
i
have
proved
at
large
i
can
not
add
any
new
arguments
i
had
entertained
some
hopes
that
however
deficient
our
theory
of
the
intellectual
world
might
be
it
would
be
free
from
those
contradictions
and
absurdities
which
seem
to
attend
every
explication
that
human
reason
can
give
of
the
material
world
but
upon
a
more
strict
review
of
the
section
concerning
personal
identity
i
find
myself
involved
in
such
a
labyrinth
that
i
must
confess
i
neither
know
how
to
correct
my
former
opinions
nor
how
to
render
them
consistent
if
this
be
not
a
good
general
reason
for
scepticism
it
is
at
least
a
sufficient
one
if
i
were
not
already
abundantly
supplied
for
me
to
entertain
a
diffidence
and
modesty
in
all
my
decisions
i
shall
propose
the
arguments
on
both
sides
beginning
with
those
that
induced
me
to
deny
the
strict
and
proper
identity
and
simplicity
of
a
self
or
thinking
being
when
we
talk
of
self
or
substance
we
must
have
an
idea
annexed
to
these
terms
otherwise
they
are
altogether
unintelligible
every
idea
is
derived
from
preceding
impressions
and
we
have
no
impression
of
self
or
substance
as
something
simple
and
individual
we
have
therefore
no
idea
of
them
in
that
sense
whatever
is
distinct
is
distinguishable
and
whatever
is
distinguishable
is
separable
by
the
thought
or
imagination
all
perceptions
are
distinct
they
are
therefore
distinguishable
and
separable
and
may
be
conceived
as
separately
existent
and
may
exist
separately
without
any
contradiction
or
absurdity
when
i
view
this
table
and
that
chimney
nothing
is
present
to
me
but
particular
perceptions
which
are
of
a
like
nature
with
all
the
other
perceptions
this
is
the
doctrine
of
philosophers
but
this
table
which
is
present
to
me
and
the
chimney
may
and
do
exist
separately
this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
vulgar
and
implies
no
contradiction
there
is
no
contradiction
therefore
in
extending
the
same
doctrine
to
all
the
perceptions
in
general
the
following
reasoning
seems
satisfactory
all
ideas
are
borrowed
from
preceding
perceptions
our
ideas
of
objects
therefore
are
derived
from
that
source
consequently
no
proposition
can
be
intelligible
or
consistent
with
regard
to
objects
which
is
not
so
with
regard
to
perceptions
but
it
is
intelligible
and
consistent
to
say
that
objects
exist
distinct
and
independent
without
any
common
simple
substance
or
subject
of
inhesion
this
proposition
therefore
can
never
be
absurd
with
regard
to
perceptions
when
i
turn
my
reflection
on
myself
i
never
can
perceive
this
self
without
some
one
or
more
perceptions
nor
can
i
ever
perceive
any
thing
but
the
perceptions
it
is
the
composition
of
these
therefore
which
forms
the
self
we
can
conceive
a
thinking
being
to
have
either
many
or
few
perceptions
suppose
the
mind
to
be
reduced
even
below
the
life
of
an
oyster
suppose
it
to
have
only
one
perception
as
of
thirst
or
hunger
consider
it
in
that
situation
do
you
conceive
any
thing
but
merely
that
perception
have
you
any
notion
of
self
or
substance
if
not
the
addition
of
other
perceptions
can
never
give
you
that
notion
the
annihilation
which
some
people
suppose
to
follow
upon
death
and
which
entirely
destroys
this
self
is
nothing
but
an
extinction
of
all
particular
perceptions
love
and
hatred
pain
and
pleasure
thought
and
sensation
these
therefore
must
be
the
same
with
self
since
the
one
can
not
survive
the
other
is
self
the
same
with
substance
if
it
be
how
can
that
question
have
place
concerning
the
subsistence
of
self
under
a
change
of
substance
if
they
be
distinct
what
is
the
difference
betwixt
them
for
my
part
i
have
a
notion
of
neither
when
conceived
distinct
from
particular
perceptions
philosophers
begin
to
be
reconciled
to
the
principle
that
we
have
no
idea
of
external
substance
distinct
from
the
ideas
of
particular
qualities
this
must
pave
the
way
for
a
like
principle
with
regard
to
the
mind
that
we
have
no
notion
of
it
distinct
from
the
particular
perceptions
so
far
i
seem
to
be
attended
with
sufficient
evidence
but
having
thus
loosened
all
our
particular
perceptions
when
i
proceed
to
explain
the
principle
of
connexion
which
binds
them
together
and
makes
us
attribute
to
them
a
real
simplicity
and
identity
i
am
sensible
that
my
account
is
very
defective
and
that
nothing
but
the
seeming
evidence
of
the
precedent
reasonings
coued
have
induced
me
to
receive
it
if
perceptions
are
distinct
existences
they
form
a
whole
only
by
being
connected
together
but
no
connexions
among
distinct
existences
are
ever
discoverable
by
human
understanding
we
only
feel
a
connexion
or
determination
of
the
thought
to
pass
from
one
object
to
another
it
follows
therefore
that
the
thought
alone
finds
personal
identity
when
reflecting
on
the
train
of
past
perceptions
that
compose
a
mind
the
ideas
of
them
are
felt
to
be
connected
together
and
naturally
introduce
each
other
however
extraordinary
this
conclusion
may
seem
it
need
not
surprize
us
most
philosophers
seem
inclined
to
think
that
personal
identity
arises
from
consciousness
and
consciousness
is
nothing
but
a
reflected
thought
or
perception
the
present
philosophy
therefore
has
so
far
a
promising
aspect
but
all
my
hopes
vanish
when
i
come
to
explain
the
principles
that
unite
our
successive
perceptions
in
our
thought
or
consciousness
i
can
not
discover
any
theory
which
gives
me
satisfaction
on
this
head
in
short
there
are
two
principles
which
i
can
not
render
consistent
nor
is
it
in
my
power
to
renounce
either
of
them
viz
that
all
our
distinct
perceptions
are
distinct
existences
and
that
the
mind
never
perceives
any
real
connexion
among
distinct
existences
did
our
perceptions
either
inhere
in
something
simple
and
individual
or
did
the
mind
perceive
some
real
connexion
among
them
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
case
for
my
part
i
must
plead
the
privilege
of
a
sceptic
and
confess
that
this
difficulty
is
too
hard
for
my
understanding
i
pretend
not
however
to
pronounce
it
absolutely
insuperable
others
perhaps
or
myself
upon
more
mature
reflections
may
discover
some
hypothesis
that
will
reconcile
those
contradictions
i
shall
also
take
this
opportunity
of
confessing
two
other
errors
of
less
importance
which
more
mature
reflection
has
discovered
to
me
in
my
reasoning
the
first
may
be
found
in
vol
page
where
i
say
that
the
distance
betwixt
two
bodies
is
known
among
other
things
by
the
angles
which
the
rays
of
light
flowing
from
the
bodies
make
with
each
other
it
is
certain
that
these
angles
are
not
known
to
the
mind
and
consequently
can
never
discover
the
distance
the
second
error
may
be
found
in
vol
page
where
i
say
that
two
ideas
of
the
same
object
can
only
be
different
by
their
different
degrees
of
force
and
vivacity
i
believe
there
are
other
differences
among
ideas
which
can
not
properly
be
comprehended
under
these
terms
had
i
said
that
two
ideas
of
the
same
object
can
only
be
different
by
their
different
feeling
i
should
have
been
nearer
the
truth
