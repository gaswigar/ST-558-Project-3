billy
mink
finds
little
joe
otter
billy
mink
ran
around
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
and
turned
down
by
the
laughing
brook
his
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
and
he
hurried
as
only
billy
can
as
he
passed
jerry
muskrat
house
jerry
saw
him
hi
billy
mink
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
this
fine
morning
he
called
to
find
little
joe
otter
have
you
seen
anything
of
him
replied
billy
no
said
jerry
he
probably
down
to
the
big
river
fishing
i
heard
him
say
last
night
that
he
was
going
thanks
said
billy
mink
and
without
waiting
to
say
more
he
was
off
like
a
little
brown
flash
jerry
watched
him
out
of
sight
hump
exclaimed
jerry
billy
mink
is
in
a
terrible
hurry
this
morning
now
i
wonder
what
he
is
so
anxious
to
find
little
joe
otter
for
when
they
get
their
heads
together
it
is
usually
for
some
mischief
jerry
climbed
to
the
top
of
his
house
and
looked
over
the
smiling
pool
in
the
direction
from
which
billy
mink
had
just
come
almost
at
once
he
saw
grandfather
frog
fast
asleep
on
his
big
green
the
legs
of
a
foolish
green
fly
were
sticking
out
of
one
corner
of
his
big
mouth
jerry
could
help
laughing
for
grandfather
frog
certainly
did
look
funny
he
had
a
good
breakfast
this
morning
and
his
full
stomach
has
made
him
sleepy
thought
jerry
but
he
getting
careless
in
his
old
age
he
certainly
is
getting
careless
the
idea
of
going
to
sleep
right
out
in
plain
sight
like
that
suddenly
a
new
thought
popped
into
his
head
billy
mink
saw
him
and
that
is
why
he
is
so
anxious
to
find
little
joe
otter
he
is
planning
to
play
some
trick
on
grandfather
frog
as
sure
as
pollywogs
have
tails
exclaimed
jerry
then
his
eyes
began
to
twinkle
as
he
added
i
think
i
have
some
fun
myself
without
another
word
jerry
slipped
down
into
the
water
and
swam
over
to
the
big
green
of
grandfather
frog
then
he
hit
the
water
a
smart
blow
with
his
tail
grandfather
frog
big
goggly
eyes
flew
open
and
he
was
just
about
to
make
a
frightened
plunge
into
the
smiling
pool
when
he
saw
jerry
have
a
nice
nap
inquired
jerry
with
a
broad
grin
i
was
asleep
protested
grandfather
frog
indignantly
i
was
just
thinking
do
you
think
it
a
rather
dangerous
plan
to
think
so
long
with
your
eyes
closed
asked
jerry
well
maybe
i
did
just
doze
off
admitted
grandfather
frog
sheepishly
maybe
you
did
replied
jerry
now
listen
then
jerry
whispered
in
grandfather
frog
ear
and
both
chuckled
as
if
they
were
enjoying
some
joke
for
they
are
great
friends
you
know
afterward
jerry
swam
back
to
his
house
and
grandfather
frog
closed
his
eyes
so
as
to
look
just
as
he
did
when
he
was
asleep
meanwhile
billy
mink
had
hurried
down
the
laughing
brook
to
the
big
river
he
met
little
joe
otter
bringing
home
a
big
fish
for
you
know
little
joe
is
a
great
fisherman
billy
mink
hastened
to
tell
him
how
grandfather
frog
had
fallen
fast
asleep
on
his
big
green
it
a
splendid
chance
to
have
some
fun
with
grandfather
frog
and
give
him
a
great
scare
concluded
billy
little
joe
otter
put
his
fish
down
and
grinned
he
likes
to
play
pranks
almost
as
well
as
he
likes
to
go
fishing
what
can
we
do
said
he
i
thought
of
a
plan
replied
billy
do
you
happen
to
know
where
we
can
find
longlegs
the
blue
heron
yes
said
little
joe
i
saw
him
fishing
not
five
minutes
ago
then
billy
told
little
joe
his
plan
and
laughing
and
giggling
the
two
little
scamps
hurried
off
to
find
longlegs
the
blue
heron
ii
longlegs
the
blue
heron
receives
callers
longlegs
the
blue
heron
felt
decidedly
out
of
sorts
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
too
beautiful
for
any
one
to
be
feeling
that
way
indeed
it
was
the
same
beautiful
morning
in
which
grandfather
frog
had
caught
so
many
foolish
green
flies
jolly
round
bright
sun
was
smiling
his
broadest
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
were
dancing
happily
here
and
there
over
the
green
meadows
looking
for
some
good
turn
to
do
for
others
the
little
feathered
people
to
whom
old
mother
nature
has
given
the
great
blessing
of
music
in
their
throats
were
pouring
out
their
sweetest
songs
so
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
no
good
reason
why
longlegs
should
feel
out
of
sorts
the
fact
is
the
trouble
with
longlegs
was
an
empty
stomach
yes
sir
that
is
what
ailed
longlegs
the
blue
heron
that
sunshiny
morning
you
know
it
is
hard
work
to
be
hungry
and
happy
at
the
same
time
so
longlegs
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
shallow
little
pool
in
the
laughing
brook
grumbling
to
himself
just
a
little
while
before
he
had
seen
little
joe
otter
carrying
home
a
big
fish
and
this
had
made
him
hungrier
and
more
out
of
sorts
than
ever
in
the
first
place
it
made
him
envious
and
envy
you
know
always
stirs
up
bad
feelings
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
little
joe
had
got
that
fish
by
boldly
chasing
it
until
he
caught
it
for
little
joe
can
swim
even
faster
than
a
fish
but
longlegs
chose
to
try
to
make
himself
think
that
it
was
all
luck
moreover
he
wanted
to
blame
some
one
for
his
own
lack
of
success
as
most
people
who
fail
do
so
when
little
joe
had
called
out
hi
longlegs
what
luck
this
fine
morning
longlegs
just
pretended
not
to
hear
but
when
little
joe
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
he
began
to
grumble
to
himself
no
wonder
i
have
no
luck
with
that
fellow
racing
up
and
down
the
laughing
brook
said
he
he
is
content
to
catch
what
he
wants
himself
but
frightens
the
rest
of
the
fish
so
that
an
honest
fisherman
like
me
has
no
chance
at
all
i
do
see
what
old
mother
nature
was
thinking
of
when
she
gave
him
a
liking
for
fish
he
and
billy
mink
are
just
two
worthless
little
scamps
born
to
make
trouble
for
other
people
he
was
still
grumbling
when
these
two
same
little
scamps
poked
their
heads
out
of
the
grass
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
pool
you
look
happy
longlegs
must
be
that
you
have
had
a
good
breakfast
said
little
joe
nudging
billy
mink
longlegs
snapped
his
great
bill
angrily
what
are
you
doing
here
spoiling
my
fishing
he
demanded
have
you
got
the
big
river
and
all
the
rest
of
the
laughing
brook
to
fool
around
in
this
is
my
pool
and
i
thank
you
to
keep
away
billy
mink
chuckled
so
that
longlegs
heard
him
and
that
did
improve
his
temper
a
bit
but
before
he
could
say
anything
more
little
joe
otter
spoke
oh
said
he
we
beg
your
pardon
we
just
happen
to
know
that
grandfather
frog
is
sound
asleep
and
we
thought
that
if
you
had
had
good
luck
this
morning
you
might
like
to
know
about
it
as
long
as
you
think
so
ill
of
us
we
just
run
over
and
tell
blackcap
the
night
heron
little
joe
turned
as
if
to
start
off
in
search
of
blackcap
at
once
hold
on
a
minute
called
longlegs
and
tried
to
make
his
voice
sound
pleasant
a
difficult
thing
to
do
because
you
know
his
voice
is
very
harsh
and
disagreeable
the
truth
is
i
have
had
a
mouthful
of
breakfast
and
to
be
hungry
is
apt
to
make
me
cross
where
did
you
say
grandfather
frog
is
i
did
say
replied
little
joe
but
if
you
really
want
to
know
he
is
sitting
on
his
big
green
in
the
smiling
pool
fast
asleep
right
in
plain
sight
thank
you
said
longlegs
i
believe
i
have
an
errand
up
that
way
now
i
think
of
it
i
believe
i
just
go
over
and
have
a
look
at
him
i
have
never
seen
him
asleep
illustration
thank
you
said
longlegs
i
believe
i
have
an
errand
up
that
way
iii
longlegs
visits
the
smiling
pool
longlegs
the
blue
heron
watched
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
disappear
down
the
laughing
brook
as
long
as
they
were
in
sight
he
sat
without
moving
his
head
drawn
down
between
his
shoulders
just
as
if
he
had
nothing
more
important
to
think
about
than
a
morning
nap
but
if
you
had
been
near
enough
to
have
seen
his
keen
eyes
you
would
never
have
suspected
him
of
even
thinking
of
a
nap
just
as
soon
as
he
felt
sure
that
the
two
little
scamps
were
out
of
sight
he
stretched
his
long
neck
up
until
he
was
almost
twice
as
tall
as
he
had
been
a
minute
before
he
looked
this
way
and
that
way
to
make
sure
that
no
danger
was
near
spread
his
great
wings
flapped
heavily
up
into
the
air
and
then
with
his
head
once
more
tucked
back
between
his
shoulders
and
his
long
legs
straight
out
behind
him
he
flew
out
over
the
green
meadows
and
making
a
big
circle
headed
straight
for
the
smiling
pool
all
this
time
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
had
not
been
so
far
away
as
longlegs
supposed
they
had
been
hiding
where
they
could
watch
him
and
the
instant
he
spread
his
wings
they
started
back
up
the
laughing
brook
towards
the
smiling
pool
to
see
what
would
happen
there
you
see
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
longlegs
was
flying
up
to
the
smiling
pool
in
the
hope
that
he
could
catch
grandfather
frog
for
his
breakfast
they
did
really
mean
that
any
harm
should
come
to
grandfather
frog
but
they
meant
that
he
should
have
a
great
fright
you
see
they
were
like
a
great
many
other
people
so
heedless
and
thoughtless
that
they
thought
it
fun
to
frighten
others
of
course
we
waken
grandfather
frog
in
time
for
him
to
get
away
with
nothing
more
than
a
great
scare
said
little
joe
otter
as
they
hurried
along
it
will
be
such
fun
to
see
his
big
goggly
eyes
pop
out
when
he
opens
them
and
sees
longlegs
just
ready
to
gobble
him
up
and
longlegs
be
hopping
mad
when
we
cheat
him
out
of
the
breakfast
he
is
so
sure
he
is
going
to
have
they
reached
the
smiling
pool
before
longlegs
who
had
taken
a
roundabout
way
and
they
hid
among
the
bulrushes
where
they
could
see
and
not
be
seen
there
the
old
fellow
just
as
i
left
him
fast
asleep
whispered
billy
mink
sure
enough
there
on
his
big
green
sat
grandfather
frog
with
his
eyes
shut
at
least
they
seemed
to
be
shut
and
over
on
top
of
his
big
house
sat
jerry
muskrat
jerry
seemed
to
be
too
busy
opening
a
clam
to
notice
anything
else
but
the
truth
is
he
was
watching
all
that
was
going
on
you
see
he
had
suspected
that
billy
mink
was
going
to
play
some
trick
on
grandfather
frog
so
he
had
warned
him
when
he
had
seen
longlegs
coming
towards
the
smiling
pool
he
had
given
grandfather
frog
another
warning
and
he
knew
that
now
he
was
only
pretending
to
be
asleep
straight
up
to
the
smiling
pool
came
longlegs
the
blue
heron
and
on
the
very
edge
of
it
among
the
bulrushes
he
dropped
his
long
legs
and
stood
with
his
toes
in
the
water
his
long
neck
stretched
up
so
that
he
could
look
all
over
the
smiling
pool
there
just
as
little
joe
otter
had
said
sat
grandfather
frog
on
his
big
green
fast
asleep
at
least
he
seemed
to
be
fast
asleep
the
eyes
of
longlegs
sparkled
with
hunger
and
the
thought
of
what
a
splendid
breakfast
grandfather
frog
would
make
very
slowly
putting
each
foot
down
as
carefully
as
he
knew
how
longlegs
began
to
walk
along
the
shore
so
as
to
get
opposite
the
big
green
where
grandfather
frog
was
sitting
and
over
in
the
bulrushes
on
the
other
side
little
joe
otter
and
billy
mink
nudged
each
other
and
clapped
their
hands
over
their
mouths
to
keep
from
laughing
aloud
iv
the
patience
of
longlegs
the
blue
heron
patience
often
wins
the
day
when
has
lost
the
way
if
there
is
one
virtue
which
longlegs
the
heron
possesses
above
another
it
is
patience
yes
sir
longlegs
certainly
has
got
patience
he
believes
that
if
a
thing
is
worth
having
it
is
worth
waiting
for
and
that
if
he
waits
long
enough
he
is
sure
to
get
it
perhaps
that
is
because
he
has
been
a
fisherman
all
his
life
and
his
father
and
his
grandfather
were
fishermen
you
know
a
fisherman
without
patience
rarely
catches
anything
of
course
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
laugh
at
this
and
say
that
it
is
so
but
the
truth
is
they
sometimes
go
hungry
when
they
would
if
they
had
a
little
of
the
patience
of
longlegs
now
grandfather
frog
is
another
who
is
very
very
patient
he
can
sit
still
the
longest
time
waiting
for
something
to
come
to
him
indeed
he
can
sit
perfectly
still
so
long
and
longlegs
can
stand
perfectly
still
so
long
that
jerry
muskrat
and
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
have
had
many
long
disputes
as
to
which
of
the
two
can
keep
still
the
longest
he
will
make
a
splendid
breakfast
thought
longlegs
as
very
very
carefully
he
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
so
as
to
get
right
opposite
grandfather
frog
there
he
stopped
and
looked
very
hard
at
grandfather
frog
yes
he
certainly
must
be
asleep
for
his
eyes
were
closed
longlegs
chuckled
to
himself
right
down
inside
without
making
a
sound
and
got
ready
to
wade
out
so
as
to
get
within
reach
now
all
the
time
grandfather
frog
was
doing
some
quiet
chuckling
himself
you
see
he
was
asleep
at
all
he
was
just
pretending
to
be
asleep
and
all
the
time
he
was
watching
longlegs
out
of
a
corner
of
one
of
his
big
goggly
eyes
very
very
slowly
and
carefully
so
as
not
to
make
the
teeniest
weeniest
sound
longlegs
lifted
one
foot
to
wade
out
into
the
smiling
pool
grandfather
frog
pretended
to
yawn
and
opened
his
big
goggly
eyes
longlegs
stood
on
one
foot
without
moving
so
much
as
a
feather
grandfather
frog
yawned
again
nodded
as
if
he
were
too
sleepy
to
keep
awake
and
half
closed
his
eyes
longlegs
waited
and
waited
then
little
by
little
so
slowly
that
if
you
had
been
there
you
would
hardly
have
seen
him
move
he
drew
his
long
neck
down
until
his
head
rested
on
his
shoulders
i
guess
i
must
wait
until
he
falls
sound
asleep
again
said
longlegs
to
himself
but
grandfather
frog
did
go
to
sleep
he
would
nod
and
nod
and
then
just
when
longlegs
would
make
up
his
mind
that
this
time
he
really
was
asleep
open
would
pop
grandfather
frog
eyes
so
all
the
long
morning
longlegs
stood
on
one
foot
without
moving
watching
and
waiting
and
growing
hungrier
and
hungrier
and
all
the
long
morning
grandfather
frog
sat
on
his
big
green
pretending
that
he
was
oh
so
sleepy
and
all
the
time
having
such
a
comfortable
and
rest
for
very
early
he
had
had
a
good
breakfast
of
foolish
green
flies
over
in
the
bulrushes
on
the
other
side
of
the
smiling
pool
two
little
scamps
in
brown
bathing
suits
waited
and
watched
for
the
great
fright
they
had
planned
for
grandfather
frog
when
they
had
sent
longlegs
to
try
to
catch
him
they
were
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
at
first
they
laughed
to
themselves
and
nudged
each
other
at
the
thought
of
the
trick
they
had
played
then
as
nothing
happened
they
began
to
grow
tired
and
uneasy
you
see
they
do
not
possess
patience
finally
they
gave
up
in
disgust
and
stole
away
to
find
some
more
exciting
sport
grandfather
frog
saw
them
go
and
chuckled
harder
than
ever
to
himself
v
grandfather
frog
jumps
just
in
time
back
and
forth
over
the
green
meadows
sailed
whitetail
the
marsh
hawk
like
longlegs
the
blue
heron
he
was
hungry
his
sharp
eyes
peered
down
among
the
grasses
looking
for
something
to
eat
but
some
good
fairy
seemed
to
have
warned
the
very
little
people
who
live
there
that
whitetail
was
out
hunting
perhaps
it
was
one
of
old
mother
west
children
the
merry
little
breezes
you
know
they
are
always
flitting
about
trying
to
do
some
one
a
good
turn
they
love
to
dance
and
romp
and
play
from
dawn
to
dusk
the
livelong
day
but
more
than
this
they
love
to
find
a
chance
to
do
some
favor
kind
anyway
little
green
snake
seemed
to
know
that
whitetail
was
out
hunting
and
managed
to
keep
out
of
sight
danny
meadow
mouse
was
to
be
found
only
a
few
foolish
grasshoppers
rewarded
his
patient
search
and
these
only
served
to
make
him
feel
hungrier
than
ever
but
old
whitetail
has
a
great
deal
of
persistence
and
in
spite
of
his
bad
luck
he
kept
at
his
hunting
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
until
he
had
been
all
over
the
green
meadows
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
wasting
time
there
i
just
have
a
look
over
at
the
smiling
pool
and
if
there
is
nothing
there
i
take
a
turn
or
two
along
the
big
river
thought
he
and
straightway
started
for
the
smiling
pool
long
before
he
reached
it
his
keen
eyes
saw
longlegs
the
blue
heron
standing
motionless
on
the
edge
of
it
and
he
knew
by
the
looks
of
longlegs
that
he
was
watching
something
which
he
hoped
to
catch
if
it
a
fish
thought
whitetail
it
will
do
me
no
good
for
i
am
no
fisherman
but
if
it
a
frog
well
frogs
are
not
as
good
eating
as
fat
meadow
mice
but
they
are
very
filling
with
that
he
hurried
a
little
faster
and
then
he
saw
what
longlegs
was
watching
so
intently
it
was
as
you
know
grandfather
frog
sitting
on
his
big
green
old
whitetail
gave
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
grandfather
frog
certainly
would
be
very
filling
very
filling
indeed
now
longlegs
the
blue
heron
was
so
intently
watching
grandfather
frog
that
he
saw
nothing
else
and
grandfather
frog
was
so
busy
watching
longlegs
that
he
quite
forgot
that
there
might
be
other
dangers
besides
his
back
was
toward
old
whitetail
of
course
whitetail
saw
this
and
it
made
him
almost
chuckle
aloud
ever
so
many
times
he
had
tried
to
catch
grandfather
frog
but
always
grandfather
frog
had
seen
him
long
before
he
could
get
near
him
now
with
all
his
keen
sight
old
whitetail
had
failed
to
see
some
one
else
who
was
sitting
right
in
plain
sight
he
had
failed
because
his
mind
was
so
full
of
grandfather
frog
and
longlegs
that
he
forgot
to
look
around
as
he
usually
does
just
skimming
the
tops
of
the
bulrushes
he
sailed
swiftly
out
over
the
smiling
pool
and
reached
down
with
his
great
cruel
claws
to
clutch
grandfather
frog
who
sat
there
pretending
to
be
asleep
but
all
the
time
watching
longlegs
and
deep
down
inside
chuckling
to
think
how
he
was
fooling
longlegs
slap
that
was
the
tail
of
jerry
muskrat
hitting
the
water
grandfather
frog
knew
what
that
meant
danger
he
did
know
what
the
danger
was
and
he
did
wait
to
find
out
there
would
be
time
enough
for
that
later
when
jerry
muskrat
slapped
the
water
with
his
tail
that
way
danger
was
very
near
indeed
with
a
frightened
chugarum
grandfather
frog
dived
head
first
into
the
smiling
pool
and
so
close
was
old
whitetail
that
the
water
was
splashed
right
in
his
face
he
clutched
frantically
with
his
great
claws
but
all
he
got
was
a
piece
of
the
big
green
on
which
grandfather
frog
had
been
sitting
and
of
course
this
was
of
no
use
for
an
empty
stomach
with
a
scream
of
disappointment
and
anger
he
whirled
in
the
air
and
made
straight
for
jerry
muskrat
but
jerry
just
laughed
in
the
most
provoking
way
and
ducked
under
water
vi
longlegs
and
whitetail
quarrel
you
did
i
did
i
did
you
did
such
a
terrible
fuss
when
grandfather
hid
you
see
longlegs
the
blue
heron
had
stood
very
patiently
on
one
foot
all
the
long
morning
waiting
for
grandfather
frog
to
go
to
sleep
on
his
big
green
he
had
felt
sure
he
was
to
have
grandfather
frog
for
his
breakfast
and
lunch
for
he
had
had
no
breakfast
and
it
was
now
lunch
time
he
was
so
hungry
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sides
of
his
stomach
certainly
would
fall
in
because
there
was
nothing
to
hold
them
up
and
then
without
any
warning
at
all
old
whitetail
the
marsh
hawk
had
glided
out
across
the
smiling
pool
with
his
great
claws
stretched
out
to
clutch
grandfather
frog
and
grandfather
frog
had
dived
into
the
smiling
pool
with
a
great
splash
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
now
is
there
anything
in
the
world
so
hard
on
the
temper
as
to
lose
a
good
meal
when
you
are
very
very
very
hungry
of
course
longlegs
did
really
have
that
good
meal
but
he
had
thought
that
he
was
surely
going
to
have
it
so
when
grandfather
frog
splashed
into
the
smiling
pool
of
course
longlegs
lost
his
temper
altogether
his
yellow
eyes
seemed
to
grow
even
more
yellow
you
robber
you
thief
he
screamed
harshly
at
old
whitetail
now
old
whitetail
was
just
as
hungry
as
longlegs
and
he
had
come
even
nearer
to
catching
grandfather
frog
he
is
even
quicker
tempered
than
longlegs
he
had
whirled
like
a
flash
on
jerry
muskrat
but
jerry
had
just
laughed
in
the
most
provoking
manner
and
ducked
under
water
this
had
made
old
whitetail
angrier
than
ever
and
then
to
be
called
bad
names
robber
and
thief
it
was
more
than
any
hawk
could
stand
yes
sir
it
certainly
was
he
fairly
shook
with
rage
as
he
turned
in
the
air
once
more
and
made
straight
for
longlegs
the
blue
heron
i
no
more
robber
and
thief
than
you
are
he
shrieked
you
frightened
away
my
frog
screamed
longlegs
i
did
you
did
i
did
it
was
your
frog
it
was
mine
chugarum
said
grandfather
frog
to
jerry
muskrat
as
they
peeped
out
from
under
some
i
did
know
i
belonged
to
anybody
i
really
did
did
you
no
replied
jerry
his
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
as
he
watched
longlegs
and
whitetail
it
news
to
me
you
too
lazy
to
hunt
like
honest
people
taunted
old
whitetail
as
he
wheeled
around
longlegs
watching
for
a
chance
to
strike
with
his
great
cruel
claws
i
too
honest
to
take
the
food
out
of
other
people
mouths
retorted
longlegs
dancing
around
so
as
always
to
face
whitetail
one
of
his
great
broad
wings
held
in
front
of
him
like
a
shield
and
his
long
strong
bill
ready
to
strike
every
feather
on
whitetail
head
was
standing
erect
with
rage
and
he
looked
very
fierce
and
terrible
at
last
he
saw
a
chance
or
thought
he
did
and
shot
down
but
all
he
got
was
a
feather
from
that
great
wing
which
longlegs
kept
in
front
of
him
and
before
he
could
get
away
that
long
bill
had
struck
him
twice
so
that
he
screamed
with
pain
so
they
fought
and
fought
till
the
ground
was
covered
with
feathers
and
they
were
too
tired
to
fight
any
longer
then
slowly
and
painfully
old
whitetail
flew
away
over
the
green
meadows
and
with
torn
and
ragged
wings
longlegs
flew
heavily
down
the
laughing
brook
towards
the
big
river
and
both
were
sore
and
stiff
and
still
hungry
dear
me
dear
me
what
a
terrible
thing
and
how
useless
anger
is
said
grandfather
frog
as
he
climbed
back
on
his
big
green
in
the
warm
sunshine
vii
grandfather
frog
big
mouth
gets
him
in
trouble
grandfather
frog
has
a
great
big
mouth
you
know
that
everybody
does
his
friends
of
the
smiling
pool
the
laughing
brook
and
the
green
meadows
have
teased
grandfather
frog
a
great
deal
about
the
size
of
his
mouth
but
he
has
minded
in
the
least
not
the
very
least
you
see
he
learned
a
long
time
ago
that
a
big
mouth
is
very
handy
for
catching
foolish
green
flies
especially
when
two
happen
to
come
along
together
so
he
is
rather
proud
of
his
big
mouth
just
as
he
is
of
his
goggly
eyes
but
once
in
a
while
his
big
mouth
gets
him
into
trouble
it
a
way
big
mouths
have
it
holds
so
much
that
it
makes
him
greedy
sometimes
he
stuffs
it
full
after
his
stomach
already
has
all
that
it
can
hold
and
then
of
course
he
ca
swallow
then
grandfather
frog
looks
very
foolish
and
silly
and
undignified
and
everybody
calls
him
a
greedy
fellow
who
is
old
enough
to
know
better
and
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
perhaps
he
is
but
he
never
says
so
and
he
is
almost
sure
to
do
the
same
thing
over
again
the
first
chance
he
has
now
it
happened
that
one
morning
when
grandfather
frog
had
had
a
very
good
breakfast
of
foolish
green
flies
and
really
did
need
another
single
thing
to
eat
who
should
come
along
but
little
joe
otter
who
had
been
down
to
the
big
river
fishing
he
had
eaten
all
he
could
hold
and
he
was
taking
the
rest
of
his
catch
to
a
secret
up
the
laughing
brook
now
grandfather
frog
is
very
fond
of
fish
for
a
change
and
when
he
saw
those
that
little
joe
otter
had
his
eyes
glistened
and
in
spite
of
his
full
stomach
his
mouth
watered
good
morning
grandfather
frog
have
you
had
your
breakfast
yet
called
little
joe
otter
grandfather
frog
wanted
to
say
no
but
he
always
tells
the
truth
he
replied
i
had
my
breakfast
such
as
it
was
why
do
you
ask
oh
for
no
reason
in
particular
i
just
thought
that
if
you
had
you
might
like
a
fish
but
as
long
as
you
have
breakfasted
of
course
you
do
want
one
said
little
joe
his
bright
eyes
beginning
to
twinkle
he
held
the
fish
out
so
that
grandfather
frog
could
see
just
how
plump
and
nice
they
were
chugarum
exclaimed
grandfather
frog
those
certainly
are
very
nice
fish
very
nice
fish
indeed
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
think
of
a
poor
old
fellow
like
me
and
i
er
well
i
might
find
room
for
just
a
little
teeny
weeny
one
if
you
can
spare
it
little
joe
otter
knows
all
about
grandfather
frog
greediness
he
looked
at
grandfather
frog
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
and
saw
how
it
was
already
stuffed
full
to
bursting
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
grew
more
mischievous
than
ever
as
he
said
of
course
i
can
but
i
would
think
of
giving
such
an
old
friend
a
teeny
weeny
one
with
that
little
joe
picked
out
the
biggest
fish
he
had
and
tossed
it
over
to
grandfather
frog
it
landed
close
by
his
nose
with
a
great
splash
and
it
was
almost
half
as
big
as
grandfather
frog
himself
it
was
plump
and
looked
so
tempting
that
grandfather
frog
forgot
all
about
his
full
stomach
he
even
forgot
to
be
polite
and
thank
little
joe
otter
he
just
opened
his
great
mouth
and
seized
the
fish
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
he
did
almost
before
you
could
wink
an
eye
the
fish
had
started
down
grandfather
frog
throat
head
first
now
you
know
grandfather
frog
has
no
teeth
and
so
he
can
not
bite
things
in
two
he
has
to
swallow
them
whole
that
is
just
what
he
started
to
do
with
the
fish
it
went
all
right
until
the
head
reached
his
stomach
but
you
ca
put
anything
more
into
a
thing
already
full
and
grandfather
frog
stomach
was
packed
as
full
as
it
could
be
of
foolish
green
flies
there
the
fish
stuck
and
gulp
and
swallow
as
hard
as
he
could
grandfather
frog
could
make
that
fish
go
a
bit
farther
then
he
tried
to
get
it
out
again
but
it
had
gone
so
far
down
his
throat
that
he
could
get
it
back
grandfather
frog
began
to
choke
viii
spotty
the
turtle
plays
doctor
greed
a
dreadful
thing
to
see
as
everybody
will
agree
at
first
little
joe
otter
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
laughed
himself
almost
sick
as
he
watched
grandfather
frog
trying
to
swallow
a
fish
almost
as
big
as
himself
when
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
was
already
stuffed
so
full
of
foolish
green
flies
that
there
was
room
for
anything
more
such
greed
would
have
been
disgusting
if
it
had
been
so
very
very
funny
at
least
it
was
funny
at
first
for
the
fish
had
stuck
with
the
tail
hanging
out
of
grandfather
frog
big
mouth
grandfather
frog
hitched
this
way
and
hitched
that
way
on
his
big
green
trying
his
best
to
swallow
twice
he
tumbled
off
with
a
splash
into
the
smiling
pool
each
time
he
scrambled
back
again
and
rolled
his
great
goggly
eyes
in
silent
appeal
to
little
joe
otter
to
come
to
his
aid
illustration
as
soon
as
they
saw
grandfather
frog
they
began
to
laugh
too
but
little
joe
was
laughing
so
that
he
had
to
hold
his
sides
and
he
did
understand
that
grandfather
frog
really
was
in
trouble
billy
mink
and
jerry
muskrat
came
along
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
grandfather
frog
they
began
to
laugh
too
they
just
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
until
the
tears
came
they
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
bank
and
kicked
their
heels
from
sheer
enjoyment
it
was
the
funniest
thing
they
had
seen
for
a
long
long
time
did
you
ever
see
such
greed
gasped
billy
mink
why
do
you
pull
it
out
and
start
over
again
shouted
little
joe
otter
now
this
is
just
what
grandfather
frog
was
trying
to
do
at
least
he
was
trying
to
pull
the
fish
out
he
had
the
least
desire
in
the
world
to
try
swallowing
it
again
in
fact
he
felt
just
then
as
if
he
never
never
wanted
to
see
another
fish
so
long
as
he
lived
but
grandfather
frog
hands
are
not
made
for
grasping
slippery
things
and
the
tail
of
a
fish
is
very
slippery
indeed
he
tried
first
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
and
at
last
with
both
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
he
just
could
budge
that
fish
he
could
cough
it
up
because
it
had
gone
too
far
down
for
that
the
more
he
clawed
at
that
waving
tail
with
his
hands
the
funnier
he
looked
and
the
harder
little
joe
otter
and
billy
mink
and
jerry
muskrat
laughed
they
made
such
a
noise
that
spotty
the
turtle
who
had
been
taking
a
on
the
end
of
an
old
log
slipped
into
the
water
and
started
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
now
spotty
the
turtle
is
very
very
slow
on
land
but
he
is
a
good
swimmer
he
hurried
now
because
he
did
want
to
miss
the
fun
at
first
he
did
see
grandfather
frog
what
the
joke
he
asked
little
joe
otter
simply
pointed
to
grandfather
frog
little
joe
had
laughed
so
much
that
he
could
even
speak
spotty
looked
over
to
the
big
green
and
started
to
laugh
too
then
he
saw
great
tears
rolling
down
from
grandfather
frog
eyes
and
heard
little
choky
sounds
he
stopped
laughing
and
started
for
grandfather
frog
as
fast
as
he
could
swim
he
climbed
right
up
on
the
big
green
and
reaching
out
grabbed
the
end
of
the
fish
tail
in
his
mouth
then
spotty
the
turtle
settled
back
and
pulled
and
grandfather
frog
settled
back
and
pulled
splash
grandfather
frog
had
fallen
backward
into
the
smiling
pool
on
one
side
of
the
big
green
splash
spotty
the
turtle
had
fallen
backward
into
the
smiling
pool
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
big
green
and
the
fish
which
had
caused
all
the
trouble
lay
floating
on
the
water
thank
you
thank
you
gasped
grandfather
frog
as
he
feebly
crawled
back
on
the
a
minute
more
and
i
would
have
choked
to
death
do
mention
it
replied
spotty
the
turtle
i
never
never
will
promised
grandfather
frog
ix
old
toad
visits
grandfather
frog
grandfather
frog
and
old
toad
are
cousins
of
course
you
know
that
without
being
told
everybody
does
but
not
everybody
knows
that
they
were
born
in
the
same
place
they
were
yes
sir
they
were
they
were
born
in
the
smiling
pool
both
had
long
tails
and
for
a
while
no
legs
and
they
played
and
swam
together
without
ever
going
on
shore
in
fact
when
they
were
babies
they
could
live
out
of
the
water
and
people
who
saw
them
did
know
the
difference
between
them
and
called
them
by
the
same
names
tadpoles
or
pollywogs
but
when
they
grew
old
enough
to
have
legs
and
get
along
without
tails
they
parted
company
you
see
it
was
this
way
grandfather
frog
of
course
he
grandfather
then
loved
the
smiling
pool
so
well
that
he
could
think
of
leaving
it
he
heard
all
about
the
great
world
and
what
a
wonderful
place
it
was
but
he
could
and
would
believe
that
there
could
be
any
nicer
place
than
the
smiling
pool
and
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
live
there
always
but
toad
could
hardly
wait
to
get
rid
of
his
tail
before
turning
his
back
on
the
smiling
pool
and
starting
out
to
see
the
great
world
nothing
that
grandfather
frog
could
say
would
stop
him
and
away
toad
went
when
he
was
so
small
that
he
could
hide
under
a
clover
leaf
grandfather
frog
did
expect
ever
to
see
him
again
but
he
did
though
it
was
for
a
long
long
time
and
when
he
did
come
back
he
had
grown
so
that
grandfather
frog
hardly
knew
him
at
first
and
right
then
and
there
began
a
dispute
which
they
have
kept
up
ever
since
whether
it
was
best
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
or
remain
in
the
home
of
childhood
each
was
sure
that
what
he
had
done
was
best
and
each
is
sure
of
it
to
this
day
so
whenever
old
toad
visits
grandfather
frog
as
he
does
every
once
in
a
while
they
are
sure
to
argue
and
argue
on
this
same
old
subject
it
was
so
on
the
day
that
grandfather
frog
had
so
nearly
choked
to
death
old
toad
had
heard
about
it
from
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
and
right
away
had
started
for
the
smiling
pool
to
pay
his
respects
to
grandfather
frog
and
to
tell
him
how
glad
he
was
that
spotty
the
turtle
had
come
along
just
in
time
to
pull
the
fish
out
of
grandfather
frog
throat
now
all
day
long
grandfather
frog
had
had
to
listen
to
unpleasant
remarks
about
his
greediness
it
was
such
a
splendid
chance
to
tease
him
that
everybody
around
the
smiling
pool
took
advantage
of
it
grandfather
frog
took
it
at
first
but
after
a
while
it
made
him
cross
and
by
the
time
his
cousin
old
toad
arrived
he
was
sulky
and
just
grunted
when
toad
told
him
how
glad
he
was
to
find
grandfather
frog
quite
recovered
old
toad
pretended
not
to
notice
how
out
of
sorts
grandfather
frog
was
but
kept
right
on
talking
if
you
had
been
out
in
the
great
world
as
much
as
i
have
been
you
would
have
known
that
little
joe
otter
was
giving
you
that
fish
for
nothing
said
he
grandfather
frog
swelled
right
out
with
anger
chugarum
he
exclaimed
in
his
deepest
gruffest
voice
chugarum
go
back
to
your
great
world
and
learn
to
mind
your
own
affairs
mr
toad
right
away
old
toad
began
to
swell
with
anger
too
for
a
whole
minute
he
glared
at
grandfather
frog
so
indignant
he
could
find
his
tongue
when
he
did
find
it
he
said
some
very
unpleasant
things
and
right
away
they
began
to
dispute
what
good
are
you
to
anybody
but
yourself
never
seeing
anything
of
the
great
world
and
not
knowing
anything
about
what
is
going
on
or
what
other
people
are
doing
asked
old
toad
i
minding
my
own
affairs
and
not
meddling
with
things
that
concern
me
as
seems
to
be
the
way
out
in
the
great
world
you
are
so
fond
of
talking
about
retorted
grandfather
frog
wise
people
know
enough
to
be
content
with
what
they
have
you
been
out
in
the
great
world
ever
since
you
could
hop
and
what
good
has
it
done
you
tell
me
that
you
have
even
a
decent
suit
of
clothes
to
your
back
grandfather
frog
patted
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
as
he
spoke
and
looked
admiringly
at
the
reflection
of
his
handsome
green
coat
in
the
smiling
pool
old
toad
eyes
snapped
for
you
know
his
suit
is
very
plain
and
rough
people
who
do
honest
work
for
their
living
have
no
time
to
sit
about
in
fine
clothes
admiring
themselves
he
replied
sharply
i
learned
this
much
out
in
the
great
world
that
lazy
people
come
to
no
good
end
and
i
know
enough
not
to
choke
myself
to
death
grandfather
frog
almost
choked
again
he
was
so
angry
you
see
old
toad
remarks
were
very
personal
and
nobody
likes
personal
remarks
when
they
are
unpleasant
especially
if
they
happen
to
be
true
grandfather
frog
was
trying
his
best
to
think
of
something
sharp
to
say
in
reply
when
redwing
sitting
in
the
top
of
the
big
shouted
here
comes
farmer
brown
boy
grandfather
frog
forgot
his
anger
and
began
to
look
anxious
he
moved
about
uneasily
on
his
big
green
and
got
ready
to
dive
into
the
smiling
pool
for
he
was
afraid
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
a
pocketful
of
stones
as
he
usually
did
have
when
he
came
over
to
the
smiling
pool
old
toad
did
look
troubled
the
least
bit
he
did
even
look
around
for
a
he
just
sat
still
and
grinned
you
better
watch
out
or
you
never
visit
the
smiling
pool
again
called
grandfather
frog
oh
replied
old
toad
i
not
afraid
farmer
brown
boy
is
a
friend
of
mine
i
help
him
in
his
garden
how
to
make
friends
is
one
of
the
things
the
great
world
has
taught
me
chugarum
said
grandfather
frog
i
have
you
to
know
that
but
what
it
was
that
he
was
to
know
old
toad
never
found
out
for
just
then
grandfather
frog
caught
sight
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
without
waiting
even
to
say
he
dived
into
the
smiling
pool
x
grandfather
frog
starts
out
to
see
the
great
world
grandfather
frog
looked
very
solemn
as
he
sat
on
his
big
green
in
the
smiling
pool
he
looked
very
much
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
a
foolish
green
fly
actually
brushed
grandfather
frog
nose
and
he
did
even
notice
it
the
fact
is
he
did
have
something
on
his
mind
it
had
been
there
ever
since
his
cousin
old
toad
had
called
the
day
before
and
they
had
quarreled
as
usual
over
the
question
whether
it
was
best
never
to
leave
home
or
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
right
in
the
midst
of
their
quarrel
along
had
come
farmer
brown
boy
now
grandfather
frog
is
afraid
of
farmer
brown
boy
so
when
he
appeared
grandfather
frog
stopped
arguing
with
old
toad
and
with
a
great
splash
dived
into
the
smiling
pool
and
hid
under
a
there
he
stayed
and
watched
his
cousin
old
toad
grinning
in
the
most
provoking
way
for
he
was
afraid
of
farmer
brown
boy
in
fact
he
had
boasted
that
they
were
friends
grandfather
frog
had
thought
that
this
was
just
an
idle
boast
but
when
he
saw
farmer
brown
boy
tickle
old
toad
under
his
chin
with
a
straw
while
toad
sat
perfectly
still
and
seemed
to
enjoy
it
he
knew
that
it
was
true
grandfather
frog
had
not
come
out
of
his
until
after
old
toad
had
gone
back
across
the
green
meadows
and
farmer
brown
boy
had
gone
home
for
his
supper
then
grandfather
frog
had
climbed
back
on
his
big
green
and
had
sat
there
half
the
night
without
once
leading
the
chorus
of
the
smiling
pool
with
his
great
deep
bass
voice
as
he
usually
did
he
was
thinking
thinking
very
hard
and
now
this
bright
sunshiny
morning
he
was
still
thinking
the
fact
is
grandfather
frog
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
perhaps
after
all
toad
was
right
if
the
great
world
had
taught
him
how
to
make
friends
with
farmer
brown
boy
there
really
must
be
some
things
worth
learning
there
not
for
the
world
would
grandfather
frog
have
admitted
to
old
toad
or
to
any
one
else
that
there
was
anything
for
him
to
learn
for
you
know
he
is
very
old
and
by
his
friends
is
accounted
very
wise
but
right
down
in
his
heart
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
perhaps
there
were
some
things
which
he
could
learn
in
the
smiling
pool
so
he
sat
and
thought
and
thought
suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
chugarum
said
he
i
do
it
do
what
asked
jerry
muskrat
who
happened
to
be
swimming
past
i
go
out
and
see
for
myself
what
this
great
world
my
cousin
old
toad
is
so
fond
of
talking
about
is
like
replied
grandfather
frog
do
you
do
it
advised
jerry
muskrat
do
you
do
anything
so
foolish
as
that
you
too
old
much
too
old
grandfather
frog
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
now
few
old
people
like
to
be
told
that
they
are
too
old
to
do
what
they
please
and
grandfather
frog
is
no
different
from
others
you
just
mind
your
own
affairs
jerry
muskrat
he
retorted
sharply
i
guess
i
know
what
is
best
for
me
without
being
told
if
my
cousin
old
toad
can
take
care
of
himself
out
in
the
great
world
i
can
he
is
half
so
spry
as
i
am
i
going
and
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
with
that
grandfather
frog
dived
into
the
smiling
pool
swam
across
to
a
place
where
the
bank
was
low
and
without
once
looking
back
started
across
the
green
meadows
to
see
the
great
world
xi
grandfather
frog
is
stubborn
fee
fi
fe
fum
chug
chug
chugarum
grandfather
actually
had
started
out
to
see
the
great
world
yes
sir
he
had
turned
his
back
on
the
smiling
pool
and
nothing
that
jerry
muskrat
could
say
made
the
least
bit
of
difference
grandfather
frog
had
made
up
his
mind
and
when
he
does
that
it
is
just
a
waste
of
time
and
breath
for
any
one
to
try
to
make
him
change
it
you
see
grandfather
frog
is
stubborn
yes
that
is
just
the
word
stubborn
he
would
see
for
himself
what
this
great
world
was
that
his
cousin
old
toad
talked
so
much
about
and
said
was
so
much
better
than
the
smiling
pool
where
grandfather
frog
had
spent
his
whole
life
if
old
toad
can
take
care
of
himself
i
can
take
care
of
myself
out
in
the
great
world
said
grandfather
frog
to
himself
as
with
great
jumps
he
started
out
on
to
the
green
meadows
i
guess
he
is
any
smarter
than
i
am
he
is
half
so
spry
as
i
am
and
i
can
jump
three
times
as
far
as
he
can
i
see
for
myself
what
this
great
world
is
like
and
then
i
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
and
stay
there
the
rest
of
my
life
chugarum
how
warm
it
is
it
was
warm
jolly
round
bright
sun
was
smiling
his
broadest
and
pouring
his
warmest
rays
down
on
the
green
meadows
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
were
taking
a
nap
you
see
they
had
played
so
hard
early
in
the
morning
that
they
were
tired
so
there
was
nobody
and
nothing
to
cool
grandfather
frog
and
he
just
grew
warmer
and
warmer
with
every
jump
he
began
to
grow
thirsty
and
how
he
did
long
for
a
plunge
in
the
dear
cool
smiling
pool
but
he
was
stubborn
he
would
turn
back
no
matter
how
uncomfortable
he
felt
he
see
the
great
world
if
it
killed
him
so
he
kept
right
on
jump
jump
jump
jump
grandfather
frog
had
been
up
the
laughing
brook
and
down
the
laughing
brook
where
he
could
swim
when
he
grew
tired
of
traveling
on
the
bank
and
where
he
could
cool
off
whenever
he
became
too
warm
but
never
before
had
he
been
very
far
away
from
water
and
he
found
this
a
very
different
matter
at
first
he
had
made
great
jumps
for
that
is
what
his
long
legs
were
given
him
for
but
the
long
grass
bothered
him
and
after
a
little
the
jumps
grew
shorter
and
shorter
and
shorter
and
with
every
jump
he
puffed
and
puffed
and
presently
began
to
grunt
you
see
he
never
before
had
made
more
than
a
few
jumps
at
a
time
without
resting
and
his
legs
grew
tired
in
a
very
little
while
now
if
grandfather
frog
had
known
as
much
about
the
green
meadows
as
the
little
people
who
live
there
all
the
time
do
he
would
have
taken
the
lone
little
path
where
the
going
was
easy
but
he
did
he
just
started
right
out
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
and
of
course
the
way
was
hard
very
hard
indeed
the
grass
was
so
tall
that
he
see
over
it
and
the
ground
was
so
rough
that
it
hurt
his
tender
feet
which
were
used
to
the
soft
mossy
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
he
had
gone
only
a
little
way
before
he
wished
with
all
his
might
that
he
had
never
thought
of
seeing
the
great
world
but
he
had
said
that
he
was
going
to
and
he
would
so
he
kept
right
on
jump
jump
rest
jump
jump
jump
rest
jump
and
then
a
long
rest
it
was
during
one
of
these
rests
that
he
heard
footsteps
and
then
a
dreadful
sound
that
made
cold
chills
run
all
over
him
sniff
sniff
sniff
it
was
coming
nearer
grandfather
frog
flattened
himself
down
as
close
to
the
ground
as
he
could
get
but
it
was
of
no
use
no
use
at
all
the
sniffing
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
right
over
him
stood
bowser
the
hound
bowser
looked
just
as
surprised
as
he
felt
he
put
out
one
paw
and
turned
grandfather
frog
over
on
his
back
grandfather
frog
struggled
to
his
feet
and
made
two
frightened
jumps
bow
wow
cried
bowser
and
rolled
him
over
again
bowser
thought
it
great
fun
but
grandfather
frog
thought
that
his
last
day
had
come
xii
grandfather
frog
keeps
on
grandfather
frog
is
old
and
wise
but
even
age
is
foolish
i
sure
you
all
agree
with
me
his
stubbornness
was
mulish
that
his
very
last
day
had
come
grandfather
frog
was
sure
he
have
the
least
doubt
about
it
here
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
bowser
the
hound
out
on
the
green
meadows
far
from
the
dear
safe
smiling
pool
every
time
he
moved
bowser
flipped
him
over
on
his
back
and
danced
around
him
barking
with
joy
every
minute
grandfather
frog
expected
to
feel
bowser
terrible
teeth
and
he
grew
cold
at
the
thought
when
he
found
that
he
could
get
away
he
just
lay
still
he
was
too
tired
and
frightened
to
do
much
of
anything
else
anyway
now
when
he
lay
still
he
spoiled
bowser
fun
for
it
was
seeing
him
jump
and
kick
his
long
legs
that
tickled
bowser
so
bowser
tossed
him
up
in
the
air
two
or
three
times
but
grandfather
frog
simply
lay
where
he
fell
without
moving
bow
wow
wow
cried
bowser
in
his
great
deep
voice
grandfather
frog
did
so
much
as
blink
his
great
goggly
eyes
bowser
sniffed
him
all
over
i
guess
i
frightened
him
to
death
said
bowser
talking
to
himself
i
did
mean
to
do
that
i
just
wanted
to
have
some
fun
with
him
with
that
bowser
took
one
more
sniff
and
then
trotted
off
to
try
to
find
something
more
exciting
you
see
he
had
had
the
least
intention
in
the
world
of
really
hurting
grandfather
frog
grandfather
frog
kept
perfectly
still
until
he
was
sure
that
bowser
was
nowhere
near
then
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
crawled
under
a
big
mullein
leaf
to
rest
and
think
things
over
chugarum
that
was
a
terrible
experience
it
was
indeed
said
he
to
himself
shivering
at
the
very
thought
of
what
he
had
been
through
nothing
like
that
ever
happened
to
me
in
the
smiling
pool
i
always
said
that
the
smiling
pool
is
a
better
place
in
which
to
live
than
is
the
great
world
and
now
i
know
it
the
question
is
what
had
i
best
do
now
now
right
down
in
his
heart
grandfather
frog
knew
the
answer
of
course
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
go
straight
back
to
the
smiling
pool
as
fast
as
he
could
but
grandfather
frog
is
stubborn
yes
sir
he
certainly
is
stubborn
and
stubbornness
is
often
just
another
name
for
foolishness
he
had
told
jerry
muskrat
that
he
was
going
out
to
see
the
great
world
now
if
he
went
back
jerry
would
laugh
at
him
i
wo
said
grandfather
frog
what
wo
you
do
asked
a
voice
so
close
to
him
that
grandfather
frog
made
a
long
jump
before
he
thought
you
see
at
the
smiling
pool
he
always
jumped
at
the
least
hint
of
danger
and
because
one
jump
always
took
him
into
the
water
he
was
always
safe
but
there
was
no
water
here
and
that
jump
took
him
right
out
where
anybody
passing
could
see
him
then
he
turned
around
to
see
who
had
startled
him
so
it
was
danny
meadow
mouse
i
wo
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
until
i
have
seen
the
great
world
replied
grandfather
frog
gruffly
illustration
you
wo
see
much
of
the
great
world
if
you
jump
like
that
every
time
you
get
a
scare
said
danny
you
wo
see
much
of
the
great
world
if
you
jump
like
that
every
time
you
get
a
scare
said
danny
shaking
his
head
no
sir
you
wo
see
much
of
the
great
world
because
one
of
these
times
you
jump
right
into
the
claws
of
old
whitetail
the
marsh
hawk
or
his
cousin
redtail
or
reddy
fox
you
take
my
advice
grandfather
frog
and
go
straight
back
to
the
smiling
pool
you
do
know
enough
about
the
great
world
to
take
care
of
yourself
but
grandfather
frog
was
set
in
his
ways
and
nothing
that
danny
meadow
mouse
could
say
changed
his
mind
in
the
least
i
started
out
to
see
the
great
world
and
i
going
to
keep
right
on
said
he
all
right
said
danny
at
last
if
you
will
i
suppose
you
will
go
a
little
way
with
you
just
to
get
you
started
right
thank
you
replied
grandfather
frog
let
start
right
away
xiii
danny
meadow
mouse
feels
responsible
responsible
is
a
great
big
word
but
it
is
just
as
big
in
its
meaning
as
it
is
in
its
looks
and
that
is
the
way
words
should
be
i
think
you
anyway
is
the
way
danny
meadow
mouse
felt
when
he
found
grandfather
frog
out
on
the
green
meadows
so
far
from
the
smiling
pool
and
so
stubborn
that
he
would
keep
on
to
see
the
great
world
instead
of
going
back
to
his
big
green
in
the
smiling
pool
where
he
could
take
care
of
himself
you
remember
peter
rabbit
felt
when
he
brought
little
miss
fuzzy
tail
down
from
the
old
pasture
to
the
dear
old
he
felt
that
it
was
his
business
to
see
to
it
that
no
harm
came
to
her
and
that
is
just
the
way
danny
meadow
mouse
felt
about
grandfather
frog
you
see
danny
knew
that
if
grandfather
frog
was
going
to
jump
like
that
every
time
he
was
frightened
he
would
get
very
far
in
the
great
world
it
might
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
the
smiling
pool
where
the
friendly
water
would
hide
him
from
his
enemies
but
it
was
just
the
wrong
thing
to
do
on
the
green
meadows
or
in
the
green
forest
danny
had
learned
when
a
very
tiny
fellow
that
there
the
only
safe
thing
to
do
when
danger
was
near
was
to
sit
perfectly
still
and
hardly
breathe
now
danny
meadow
mouse
is
fond
of
grandfather
frog
and
he
could
bear
to
think
that
something
dreadful
might
happen
to
him
so
when
he
found
that
he
could
get
grandfather
frog
to
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
just
to
go
along
with
grandfather
frog
to
try
to
keep
him
out
of
danger
yes
sir
he
just
to
do
it
he
felt
for
grandfather
frog
safety
so
here
they
were
danny
meadow
mouse
running
ahead
anxious
and
worried
and
watching
sharply
for
signs
of
danger
and
grandfather
frog
puffing
along
behind
bound
to
see
the
great
world
which
his
cousin
old
toad
said
was
a
better
place
to
live
in
than
the
smiling
pool
now
danny
has
a
great
many
private
little
paths
under
the
grass
all
over
the
green
meadows
and
along
these
he
can
scamper
ever
so
fast
without
once
showing
himself
to
those
who
may
be
looking
for
him
of
course
he
started
to
take
grandfather
frog
along
one
of
these
little
paths
but
grandfather
frog
does
walk
or
run
he
jumps
there
was
room
in
danny
little
paths
for
jumping
as
they
soon
found
out
grandfather
frog
simply
could
follow
danny
along
those
little
paths
danny
sat
down
to
think
and
puckered
his
brows
anxiously
he
was
more
worried
than
ever
it
was
very
clear
that
grandfather
frog
would
have
to
travel
out
in
the
open
where
there
was
room
for
him
to
jump
and
where
also
he
would
be
right
out
in
plain
sight
of
all
who
happened
along
once
more
danny
urged
him
to
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
but
he
might
just
as
well
have
talked
to
a
stick
or
a
stone
grandfather
frog
had
started
out
to
see
the
great
world
and
he
was
going
to
see
it
danny
sighed
if
you
will
you
will
i
suppose
said
he
and
i
guess
the
only
place
you
can
travel
in
any
comfort
is
the
lone
little
path
it
is
dangerous
very
dangerous
but
i
guess
you
will
have
to
do
it
chugarum
replied
grandfather
frog
i
not
afraid
you
show
me
the
lone
little
path
and
then
go
about
your
business
danny
meadow
mouse
so
danny
led
the
way
to
the
lone
little
path
and
grandfather
frog
sighed
with
relief
for
here
he
could
jump
without
getting
all
tangled
up
in
long
grass
and
without
hurting
his
tender
feet
on
sharp
stubble
where
the
grass
had
been
cut
but
danny
felt
more
worried
than
ever
he
would
leave
grandfather
frog
because
you
know
he
felt
for
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
terribly
afraid
for
he
felt
sure
that
some
of
their
enemies
would
see
them
he
wanted
to
go
back
but
he
kept
right
on
and
that
shows
just
what
a
brave
little
fellow
danny
meadow
mouse
was
xiv
grandfather
frog
has
a
strange
ride
a
thousand
things
may
happen
to
ten
thousand
things
befall
the
traveler
who
careless
is
or
thinks
he
knows
it
all
grandfather
frog
jumping
along
behind
danny
meadow
mouse
up
the
lone
little
path
was
beginning
to
think
that
danny
was
the
most
timid
and
easiest
frightened
of
all
the
little
meadow
people
of
his
acquaintance
danny
kept
as
much
under
the
grass
that
overhung
the
lone
little
path
as
he
could
when
there
were
perfectly
bare
places
danny
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
anxiously
and
then
scampered
across
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
little
legs
go
when
he
was
safely
across
he
would
wait
for
grandfather
frog
if
a
shadow
passed
over
the
grass
danny
would
duck
under
the
nearest
leaf
and
hold
his
breath
foolish
muttered
grandfather
frog
foolish
foolish
to
be
so
afraid
now
i
not
afraid
until
i
see
something
to
be
afraid
of
time
enough
then
what
the
good
of
looking
for
trouble
all
the
time
now
here
i
am
out
in
the
great
world
and
i
not
afraid
and
here
danny
meadow
mouse
who
has
lived
here
all
his
life
acting
as
if
he
expected
something
dreadful
to
happen
any
minute
pooh
how
very
very
foolish
now
grandfather
frog
is
old
and
in
the
smiling
pool
he
is
accounted
very
very
wise
but
the
wisest
sometimes
become
foolish
when
they
think
that
they
know
all
there
is
to
know
it
was
so
with
grandfather
frog
it
was
he
who
was
foolish
and
not
danny
meadow
mouse
you
see
danny
knew
all
the
dangers
on
the
green
meadows
and
how
many
sharp
eyes
were
all
the
time
watching
for
him
he
had
long
ago
learned
that
the
only
way
to
feel
safe
was
to
feel
afraid
you
see
then
he
was
watching
for
danger
every
minute
and
so
he
was
likely
to
be
surprised
by
his
hungry
enemies
so
while
grandfather
frog
was
looking
down
on
danny
for
being
so
timid
danny
was
really
doing
the
wisest
thing
more
than
that
he
was
really
very
very
brave
he
was
showing
grandfather
frog
the
way
up
the
lone
little
path
to
see
the
great
world
when
he
himself
would
never
never
have
thought
of
traveling
anywhere
but
along
his
own
secret
little
paths
just
because
grandfather
frog
could
jump
anywhere
excepting
where
the
way
was
fairly
clear
as
in
the
lone
little
path
and
danny
was
afraid
that
unless
grandfather
frog
had
some
one
with
him
to
watch
out
for
him
he
would
surely
come
to
a
sad
end
the
farther
they
went
with
nothing
happening
the
more
foolish
timid
way
of
running
and
hiding
seemed
to
grandfather
frog
and
he
was
just
about
to
tell
danny
just
what
he
thought
when
danny
dived
into
the
long
grass
and
warned
grandfather
frog
to
do
the
same
but
grandfather
frog
did
chugarum
said
he
i
do
see
anything
to
be
afraid
of
and
i
not
going
to
hide
until
i
do
so
he
sat
still
right
where
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
lone
little
path
looking
this
way
and
that
way
and
seeing
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
just
then
around
a
turn
in
the
lone
little
path
came
who
do
you
think
why
farmer
brown
boy
he
saw
grandfather
frog
and
with
a
whoop
of
joy
he
sprang
for
him
grandfather
frog
gave
a
frightened
croak
and
jumped
but
he
was
too
late
before
he
could
jump
again
farmer
boy
had
him
by
his
long
ha
ha
shouted
farmer
brown
boy
i
believe
this
is
the
very
old
chap
i
have
tried
so
often
to
catch
in
the
smiling
pool
these
legs
of
yours
will
be
mighty
fine
eating
frog
they
will
indeed
with
that
he
tied
grandfather
frog
legs
together
and
went
on
his
way
across
the
green
meadows
with
poor
old
grandfather
frog
dangling
from
the
end
of
a
string
it
was
a
strange
ride
and
a
most
uncomfortable
one
and
with
all
his
might
grandfather
frog
wished
he
had
never
thought
of
going
out
into
the
great
world
xv
grandfather
frog
gives
up
hope
with
his
legs
tied
together
hanging
head
down
from
the
end
of
a
string
grandfather
frog
was
being
carried
he
knew
not
where
by
farmer
boy
it
was
dreadful
across
the
green
meadows
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
came
dancing
along
at
first
they
see
grandfather
frog
but
presently
one
of
them
rushing
up
to
tease
farmer
brown
boy
by
blowing
off
his
hat
caught
sight
of
grandfather
frog
now
the
merry
little
breezes
are
great
friends
of
grandfather
frog
many
many
times
they
have
blown
foolish
green
flies
over
to
him
as
he
sat
on
his
big
green
and
they
are
very
fond
of
him
so
when
this
one
caught
sight
of
him
in
such
a
dreadful
position
he
forgot
all
about
teasing
farmer
brown
boy
he
raced
away
to
tell
the
other
merry
little
breezes
for
a
minute
they
were
perfectly
still
they
forgot
all
about
being
merry
it
awful
just
perfectly
awful
cried
one
we
must
do
something
to
help
grandfather
frog
cried
another
of
course
we
must
said
a
third
but
what
can
we
do
asked
a
fourth
nobody
replied
they
just
thought
and
thought
and
thought
finally
the
first
one
spoke
we
might
try
to
comfort
him
a
little
said
he
of
course
we
will
do
that
they
shouted
all
together
and
if
we
throw
dust
in
the
face
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
steal
his
hat
perhaps
he
will
put
grandfather
frog
down
continued
the
merry
little
breeze
the
very
thing
the
others
cried
dancing
about
with
excitement
then
we
can
rush
about
and
tell
all
grandfather
frog
friends
what
has
happened
to
him
and
where
he
is
perhaps
some
of
them
can
help
us
the
little
breeze
continued
they
wasted
no
more
time
talking
but
raced
after
farmer
brown
boy
as
fast
as
they
could
go
one
of
them
who
was
faster
than
the
others
ran
ahead
and
whispered
in
grandfather
frog
ear
that
they
were
coming
to
help
him
but
poor
old
grandfather
frog
could
be
comforted
he
could
see
what
there
was
that
the
merry
little
breezes
could
do
his
legs
smarted
where
the
string
cut
into
the
skin
and
his
head
ached
for
you
know
he
was
hanging
head
down
no
sir
grandfather
frog
could
be
comforted
he
was
in
a
terrible
fix
and
he
could
see
any
way
out
of
it
he
had
the
least
bit
of
hope
left
and
all
the
time
farmer
brown
boy
was
trudging
along
whistling
merrily
you
see
it
did
occur
to
him
to
think
how
grandfather
frog
must
be
suffering
and
how
terribly
frightened
he
must
be
he
was
cruel
no
indeed
farmer
brown
boy
was
cruel
that
is
he
did
mean
to
be
cruel
he
was
just
thoughtless
like
a
great
many
other
boys
and
girls
too
so
he
went
whistling
on
his
way
until
he
reached
the
long
lane
leading
from
the
green
meadows
up
to
farmer
brown
dooryard
no
sooner
was
he
in
the
long
lane
than
something
happened
a
great
cloud
of
dust
and
leaves
and
tiny
sticks
was
dashed
in
his
face
and
nearly
choked
him
dirt
got
in
his
eyes
his
hat
was
snatched
from
his
head
and
went
sailing
over
into
the
garden
he
dropped
grandfather
frog
and
felt
for
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
dirt
from
his
eyes
phew
exclaimed
farmer
brown
boy
as
he
started
after
his
hat
funny
where
that
wind
came
from
so
suddenly
but
you
know
and
i
know
that
it
was
the
merry
little
breezes
working
together
who
made
up
that
sudden
wind
and
grandfather
frog
ought
to
have
known
it
too
but
he
did
you
see
the
dust
had
got
in
his
nose
and
eyes
just
as
it
had
in
those
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
he
was
so
frightened
and
confused
that
he
could
think
so
he
lay
just
where
farmer
brown
boy
dropped
him
and
he
did
have
any
more
hope
than
before
xvi
the
merry
little
breezes
work
hard
the
merry
little
breezes
almost
shouted
aloud
with
delight
when
they
saw
farmer
brown
boy
drop
grandfather
frog
to
feel
for
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
out
the
dust
which
they
had
thrown
in
his
eyes
then
he
had
to
climb
the
fence
and
chase
his
hat
through
the
garden
they
would
let
him
almost
get
his
hands
on
it
and
then
just
as
he
thought
that
he
surely
had
it
they
would
snatch
it
away
it
was
great
fun
for
the
merry
little
breezes
but
they
were
not
doing
it
for
fun
no
indeed
they
were
not
doing
it
for
fun
they
were
doing
it
to
lead
farmer
brown
boy
away
from
grandfather
frog
just
as
soon
as
they
dared
they
dropped
the
hat
and
then
separated
and
rushed
away
in
all
directions
across
the
green
meadows
over
to
the
green
forest
and
down
to
the
smiling
pool
what
were
they
going
for
why
to
hunt
for
some
of
grandfather
frog
friends
and
ask
their
help
you
see
the
merry
little
breezes
could
make
farmer
brown
boy
drop
grandfather
frog
but
they
could
untie
a
knot
or
cut
a
string
and
this
is
just
what
had
got
to
be
done
to
set
grandfather
frog
free
for
his
were
tied
together
so
now
they
were
looking
for
some
one
with
sharp
teeth
who
thought
enough
of
grandfather
frog
to
come
and
help
him
one
thought
of
striped
chipmunk
and
started
for
the
old
stone
wall
to
look
for
him
another
went
in
search
of
danny
meadow
mouse
a
third
headed
for
the
dear
old
after
peter
rabbit
a
fourth
remembered
jimmy
skunk
and
how
he
had
once
set
blacky
the
crow
free
from
a
snare
a
fifth
remembered
what
sharp
teeth
happy
jack
squirrel
has
and
hurried
over
to
the
green
forest
to
look
for
him
a
sixth
started
straight
for
the
smiling
pool
to
tell
jerry
muskrat
and
every
one
of
them
raced
as
fast
as
he
could
all
this
time
grandfather
frog
was
without
hope
yes
sir
poor
old
grandfather
frog
was
wholly
in
despair
you
see
he
did
know
what
the
merry
little
breezes
were
trying
to
do
and
he
was
so
frightened
and
confused
that
he
could
think
when
farmer
brown
boy
dropped
him
he
lay
right
where
he
fell
for
a
few
minutes
then
right
close
at
hand
he
saw
an
old
board
without
really
thinking
he
tried
to
get
to
it
for
there
looked
as
if
there
might
be
room
for
him
to
hide
under
it
it
was
hard
work
for
you
know
his
long
which
he
uses
for
jumping
were
tied
together
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
crawl
and
wriggle
and
pull
himself
along
just
as
farmer
brown
boy
started
to
climb
the
fence
back
into
the
long
lane
his
hat
in
his
hand
grandfather
frog
reached
the
old
board
and
crawled
under
it
now
when
the
merry
little
breezes
had
thrown
the
dust
in
farmer
boy
face
and
snatched
his
hat
he
had
dropped
grandfather
frog
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
did
notice
just
where
he
did
drop
him
so
now
he
did
know
the
exact
place
to
look
for
him
but
he
knew
pretty
near
and
he
had
the
least
doubt
but
that
he
would
find
him
he
had
just
started
to
look
when
the
dinner
horn
sounded
farmer
brown
boy
hesitated
he
was
hungry
if
he
was
late
he
might
lose
his
dinner
he
could
come
back
later
to
look
for
grandfather
frog
for
with
his
legs
tied
grandfather
frog
could
get
far
so
with
a
last
look
to
make
sure
of
the
place
farmer
brown
boy
started
for
the
house
if
the
merry
little
breezes
had
known
this
they
would
have
felt
ever
so
much
better
but
they
did
so
they
hurried
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
to
find
grandfather
frog
friends
and
worked
until
they
were
almost
too
tired
to
move
for
it
seemed
as
if
every
single
one
of
grandfather
frog
friends
had
taken
that
particular
day
to
go
away
from
home
so
while
farmer
brown
boy
ate
his
dinner
and
grandfather
frog
lay
hiding
under
the
old
board
in
the
long
lane
the
merry
little
breezes
did
their
best
to
find
help
for
him
xvii
striped
chipmunk
cuts
the
string
hippy
hop
flippy
flop
all
on
a
summer
day
my
mother
turned
me
from
the
house
and
sent
me
out
to
play
striped
chipmunk
knew
perfectly
well
that
that
was
just
nonsense
but
striped
chipmunk
learned
a
long
time
ago
that
when
you
are
just
bubbling
right
over
with
good
feeling
there
is
fun
in
saying
and
doing
foolish
things
and
that
is
just
how
he
was
feeling
so
he
ran
along
the
old
rail
fence
on
one
side
of
the
long
lane
saying
foolish
things
and
cutting
up
foolish
capers
just
because
he
felt
so
good
and
all
the
time
seeing
all
that
those
bright
little
eyes
of
his
could
take
in
now
striped
chipmunk
and
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
are
great
friends
very
great
friends
indeed
almost
every
morning
they
have
a
grand
frolic
together
but
this
morning
the
merry
little
breezes
had
come
over
to
the
old
stone
wall
where
striped
chipmunk
makes
his
home
anyway
they
had
come
at
the
usual
time
striped
chipmunk
had
waited
a
little
while
and
then
because
he
was
feeling
so
good
he
had
decided
to
take
a
run
down
the
long
lane
to
see
if
anything
new
had
happened
there
that
is
how
it
happened
that
when
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
did
go
to
look
for
him
and
was
terribly
anxious
to
ask
him
to
come
to
the
help
of
grandfather
frog
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
but
striped
chipmunk
did
know
anything
about
that
he
scampered
along
the
top
rails
of
the
old
fence
jumped
up
on
top
of
a
post
and
sat
up
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
for
striped
chipmunk
is
very
neat
and
can
not
bear
to
be
the
least
bit
dirty
he
looked
up
and
winked
at
mistah
buzzard
sailing
round
and
round
way
way
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
he
chased
his
own
tail
round
and
round
until
he
nearly
fell
off
of
the
post
he
made
a
wry
face
in
the
direction
of
redtail
the
hawk
whom
he
could
see
sitting
in
the
top
of
a
tall
tree
way
over
on
the
green
meadows
he
scolded
bowser
the
hound
who
happened
to
come
trotting
up
the
long
lane
and
did
stop
scolding
until
bowser
was
out
of
sight
then
he
kicked
up
his
heels
and
whisked
along
the
old
fence
again
across
a
shaky
old
rail
he
suddenly
stopped
his
bright
eyes
had
seen
something
that
filled
him
with
curiosity
quite
as
much
curiosity
as
peter
rabbit
would
have
had
it
was
a
piece
of
string
yes
sir
it
was
a
piece
of
string
now
striped
chipmunk
often
had
found
pieces
of
string
so
there
was
nothing
particularly
interesting
in
the
string
itself
what
did
interest
him
and
make
him
very
curious
was
the
fact
that
this
piece
of
string
kept
moving
every
few
seconds
it
gave
a
little
jerk
whoever
heard
of
a
piece
of
string
moving
all
by
itself
certainly
striped
chipmunk
never
had
he
could
understand
it
for
a
few
minutes
he
watched
it
from
the
top
rail
of
the
old
fence
then
he
scurried
down
to
the
ground
and
a
few
steps
at
a
time
stopping
to
watch
sharply
between
each
little
run
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
queer
acting
string
it
gave
him
a
funny
feeling
inside
to
see
a
string
acting
like
that
so
he
was
very
careful
not
to
get
too
near
he
looked
at
it
from
one
side
then
ran
around
and
looked
at
it
from
the
other
side
at
last
he
got
where
he
could
see
that
one
end
of
the
string
was
under
an
old
board
and
then
he
began
to
understand
of
course
there
was
somebody
hiding
under
that
old
board
and
jerking
the
string
illustration
he
seized
the
other
end
of
the
string
and
began
to
pull
striped
chipmunk
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
whoever
was
pulling
that
string
could
be
very
big
or
they
would
never
have
been
able
to
crawl
under
that
old
board
therefore
he
need
be
afraid
a
gleam
of
mischief
twinkled
in
striped
chipmunk
eyes
he
seized
the
other
end
of
the
string
and
began
to
pull
such
a
jerking
and
yanking
as
began
right
away
but
he
held
on
and
pulled
harder
then
out
from
under
the
old
board
appeared
the
queer
webbed
feet
of
grandfather
frog
tied
together
striped
chipmunk
was
so
surprised
that
he
let
go
of
the
string
and
nearly
fell
over
backward
why
grandfather
frog
what
under
the
sun
are
you
doing
here
he
shouted
when
striped
chipmunk
let
go
of
the
string
grandfather
frog
promptly
drew
his
feet
back
under
the
old
board
but
when
he
heard
striped
chipmunk
voice
he
slowly
and
painfully
crawled
out
he
told
how
he
had
been
caught
and
tied
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
finally
dropped
near
the
old
board
he
told
how
terribly
frightened
he
was
and
how
sore
his
legs
were
striped
chipmunk
did
wait
for
him
to
finish
in
a
flash
he
was
at
work
with
his
sharp
teeth
and
had
cut
the
cruel
string
before
grandfather
frog
had
finished
his
story
xviii
grandfather
frog
hurries
away
when
striped
chipmunk
cut
the
string
that
bound
the
long
legs
of
grandfather
frog
together
grandfather
frog
was
so
relieved
that
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
of
course
he
thanked
striped
chipmunk
over
and
over
again
striped
chipmunk
said
that
it
was
nothing
just
nothing
at
all
and
that
he
was
very
glad
indeed
to
help
grandfather
frog
we
folks
who
live
out
in
the
great
world
have
to
help
one
another
said
striped
chipmunk
because
we
never
know
when
we
may
need
help
ourselves
now
you
take
my
advice
grandfather
frog
and
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
as
fast
as
you
can
the
great
world
is
no
place
for
an
old
fellow
like
you
because
you
do
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
now
when
he
said
that
striped
chipmunk
made
a
great
mistake
old
people
never
like
to
be
told
that
they
are
old
or
that
they
do
not
know
all
there
is
to
know
grandfather
frog
straightened
up
and
tried
to
look
very
dignified
chugarum
said
he
i
have
you
to
know
striped
chipmunk
that
people
were
coming
to
me
for
advice
before
you
were
born
it
was
just
an
accident
that
farmer
brown
boy
caught
me
and
i
like
to
see
him
do
it
again
yes
sir
i
like
to
see
him
do
it
again
dear
me
dear
me
grandfather
frog
was
boasting
if
he
had
been
safe
at
home
in
the
smiling
pool
there
might
have
been
some
excuse
for
boasting
but
way
over
here
in
the
long
lane
not
even
knowing
the
way
back
to
the
smiling
pool
it
was
foolish
very
foolish
indeed
no
one
knew
that
better
than
striped
chipmunk
but
he
has
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
grandfather
frog
and
he
knew
too
that
grandfather
frog
was
feeling
very
much
out
of
sorts
and
very
much
mortified
to
think
that
he
had
been
caught
in
such
a
scrape
so
he
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
to
hide
a
smile
as
he
said
of
course
he
is
going
to
catch
you
again
i
know
how
wise
and
smart
you
are
but
you
look
to
me
very
tired
and
there
are
so
many
dangers
out
here
in
the
great
world
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
back
to
the
smiling
pool
but
grandfather
frog
is
stubborn
you
know
he
had
started
out
to
see
the
great
world
and
he
did
want
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
to
think
that
he
was
afraid
the
truth
is
grandfather
frog
was
more
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
than
he
was
of
the
dangers
around
him
which
shows
just
how
foolish
wise
people
can
be
sometimes
so
he
shook
his
head
chugarum
said
he
i
am
going
to
see
the
great
world
first
and
then
i
am
going
back
to
the
smiling
pool
do
you
happen
to
know
where
there
is
any
water
i
am
very
thirsty
now
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
long
lane
was
a
spring
where
farmer
brown
boy
filled
his
jug
with
clear
cold
water
to
take
with
him
to
the
cornfield
when
he
had
to
work
there
striped
chipmunk
knew
all
about
that
spring
for
he
had
been
there
for
a
drink
many
times
so
he
told
grandfather
frog
just
where
the
spring
was
and
how
to
get
to
it
he
even
offered
to
show
the
way
but
grandfather
frog
said
that
he
would
rather
go
alone
watch
out
grandfather
frog
and
do
fall
in
because
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
out
again
warned
striped
chipmunk
grandfather
frog
looked
up
sharply
to
see
if
striped
chipmunk
was
making
fun
of
him
the
very
idea
of
any
one
thinking
that
he
who
had
lived
in
the
water
all
his
life
could
get
out
when
he
pleased
but
striped
chipmunk
looked
really
in
earnest
so
grandfather
frog
swallowed
the
quick
retort
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
thanked
striped
chipmunk
and
hurried
away
to
look
for
the
spring
for
he
was
very
very
thirsty
besides
he
was
very
very
hot
and
he
hurried
still
faster
as
he
thought
of
the
cool
bath
he
would
have
when
he
found
that
spring
xix
grandfather
frog
jumps
into
more
trouble
some
people
are
heedless
and
run
into
trouble
some
people
are
stupid
and
walk
into
trouble
grandfather
frog
was
both
heedless
and
stupid
and
jumped
into
trouble
when
striped
chipmunk
told
him
where
the
spring
was
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
wait
to
reach
it
you
see
grandfather
frog
had
spent
all
his
life
in
the
smiling
pool
where
he
could
get
a
drink
whenever
he
wanted
it
by
just
reaching
over
the
edge
of
his
big
green
whenever
he
was
too
warm
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
say
chugarum
and
dive
head
first
into
the
cool
water
so
he
was
used
to
going
a
long
time
without
water
jump
jump
jump
grandfather
frog
was
going
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
in
the
direction
striped
chipmunk
had
pointed
out
every
three
or
four
jumps
he
would
stop
for
just
a
wee
wee
bit
of
rest
then
off
he
would
go
again
jump
jump
jump
and
each
jump
was
a
long
one
peter
rabbit
certainly
would
have
been
envious
if
he
could
have
seen
those
long
jumps
of
grandfather
frog
at
last
the
ground
began
to
grow
damp
the
farther
he
went
the
damper
it
grew
presently
it
became
fairly
wet
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
soft
cool
wet
moss
how
good
it
did
feel
to
grandfather
frog
poor
tired
feet
must
be
i
most
there
said
grandfather
frog
to
himself
as
he
scrambled
up
on
a
big
mossy
hummock
so
as
to
look
around
right
away
he
saw
a
little
path
from
the
direction
of
the
long
lane
it
led
straight
past
the
very
hummock
on
which
grandfather
frog
was
sitting
and
he
noticed
that
where
the
ground
was
very
soft
and
wet
old
boards
had
been
laid
down
that
puzzled
grandfather
frog
a
great
deal
it
a
sure
enough
path
said
he
but
what
under
the
blue
blue
sky
does
any
one
want
to
spoil
it
for
by
putting
those
boards
there
you
see
grandfather
frog
likes
the
soft
wet
mud
and
he
understand
how
any
one
even
farmer
brown
boy
could
prefer
a
hard
dry
path
of
course
he
never
had
worn
shoes
himself
so
he
understand
why
any
one
should
want
dry
feet
when
they
could
just
as
well
have
wet
ones
he
was
still
puzzling
over
it
when
he
heard
a
sound
that
made
him
nearly
lose
his
balance
and
tumble
off
the
hummock
it
was
a
whistle
the
whistle
of
farmer
brown
boy
grandfather
frog
knew
it
right
away
because
he
often
had
heard
it
over
by
the
smiling
pool
the
whistle
came
from
over
in
the
long
lane
farmer
brown
boy
had
had
his
dinner
and
was
on
his
way
back
to
look
for
grandfather
frog
where
he
had
been
dropped
grandfather
frog
actually
grinned
as
he
thought
how
surprised
farmer
brown
boy
was
going
to
be
when
he
could
find
no
trace
of
him
suddenly
the
smile
seemed
to
freeze
on
grandfather
frog
face
that
whistle
was
coming
nearer
farmer
brown
boy
had
left
the
long
lane
and
was
coming
along
the
little
path
the
truth
is
he
was
coming
for
a
drink
at
the
spring
but
grandfather
frog
did
think
of
this
he
was
sure
that
in
some
way
farmer
brown
boy
had
found
out
which
way
he
had
gone
and
was
coming
after
him
he
crouched
down
as
flat
as
he
could
on
the
big
hummock
and
held
his
breath
farmer
brown
boy
went
straight
past
just
a
few
steps
beyond
he
stopped
and
knelt
down
peeping
through
the
grass
grandfather
frog
saw
him
dip
up
beautiful
clear
water
in
an
old
cup
and
drink
then
grandfather
frog
knew
just
where
the
spring
was
a
few
minutes
later
farmer
brown
boy
passed
again
still
whistling
on
his
way
to
the
long
lane
grandfather
frog
waited
only
long
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
had
really
gone
then
with
bigger
jumps
than
ever
he
started
for
the
spring
a
dozen
long
jumps
and
he
could
see
the
water
two
more
jumps
and
then
a
long
jump
and
he
had
landed
in
the
spring
with
a
splash
chugarum
cried
grandfather
frog
how
good
the
water
feels
and
all
the
time
grandfather
frog
had
jumped
straight
into
more
trouble
xx
grandfather
frog
loses
heart
look
before
you
leap
the
water
may
be
deep
that
is
the
very
best
kind
of
advice
but
most
people
find
that
out
when
it
is
too
late
grandfather
frog
did
of
course
he
had
heard
that
little
verse
all
his
life
indeed
he
had
been
very
fond
of
saying
it
to
those
who
came
to
the
smiling
pool
to
ask
his
advice
but
grandfather
frog
seemed
to
have
left
all
his
wisdom
behind
him
when
he
left
the
smiling
pool
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
you
see
it
is
very
hard
work
for
any
one
whose
advice
has
been
sought
to
turn
right
around
and
take
advice
themselves
so
grandfather
frog
had
been
getting
into
scrapes
ever
since
he
started
out
on
his
foolish
journey
and
now
here
he
was
in
still
another
and
he
had
landed
in
it
head
first
with
a
great
splash
of
course
when
he
had
seen
the
cool
sparkling
water
of
the
spring
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
just
could
wait
another
second
to
get
into
it
he
was
so
hot
and
dry
and
dreadfully
thirsty
and
uncomfortable
and
so
oh
dear
me
grandfather
frog
did
look
at
all
before
he
leaped
no
sir
he
did
he
just
dived
in
with
a
great
long
jump
oh
how
good
that
water
felt
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
think
of
anything
else
it
was
cooler
than
the
water
of
the
smiling
pool
because
as
you
know
it
was
a
spring
but
it
felt
all
the
better
for
that
and
grandfather
frog
just
closed
his
eyes
and
floated
there
in
pure
happiness
presently
he
opened
his
eyes
to
look
around
then
he
blinked
them
rapidly
for
a
minute
or
so
he
rubbed
them
to
make
sure
that
he
saw
aright
his
heart
seemed
to
sink
way
way
down
towards
his
toes
chugarum
exclaimed
grandfather
frog
chugarum
and
after
that
for
a
long
time
he
did
say
a
word
you
see
it
was
this
way
all
around
him
rose
perfectly
straight
smooth
walls
he
could
look
up
and
see
a
little
of
the
blue
blue
sky
right
overhead
and
whispering
leaves
of
trees
and
bushes
over
the
edge
of
the
smooth
straight
wall
grasses
were
bending
but
they
were
so
far
above
his
head
so
dreadfully
far
was
any
place
to
climb
out
grandfather
frog
was
in
a
prison
he
did
understand
it
at
all
but
it
was
so
of
course
farmer
brown
boy
could
have
told
him
all
about
it
a
long
time
before
farmer
brown
himself
had
found
that
spring
and
because
the
water
was
so
clear
and
cold
and
pure
he
had
cleared
away
all
the
dirt
and
rubbish
around
it
then
he
had
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
a
nice
clean
barrel
and
had
dug
down
where
the
water
bubbled
up
out
of
the
sand
and
had
set
the
barrel
down
in
this
hole
and
had
filled
in
the
bottom
with
clean
white
sand
for
the
water
to
bubble
up
through
about
up
the
barrel
he
had
cut
a
little
hole
for
the
water
to
run
out
as
fast
as
it
bubbled
in
at
the
bottom
of
course
the
water
never
could
fill
the
barrel
because
when
it
reached
that
hole
it
ran
out
this
left
a
straight
smooth
wall
up
above
a
wall
altogether
too
high
for
grandfather
frog
to
jump
over
from
the
inside
poor
old
grandfather
frog
he
wished
more
than
ever
that
he
never
never
had
thought
of
leaving
the
smiling
pool
to
see
the
great
world
round
and
round
he
swam
but
he
could
see
any
way
out
of
it
the
little
hole
where
the
water
ran
out
was
too
small
for
him
to
squeeze
through
as
he
found
out
by
trying
and
trying
so
far
as
he
could
see
he
had
just
got
to
stay
there
all
the
rest
of
his
life
worse
still
he
knew
that
farmer
brown
boy
sometimes
came
to
the
spring
for
a
drink
for
he
had
seen
him
do
it
that
meant
that
the
very
next
time
he
came
he
would
find
grandfather
frog
because
there
was
no
place
to
hide
when
grandfather
frog
thought
of
that
he
just
lost
heart
yes
sir
he
just
lost
heart
he
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
the
smiling
pool
again
and
two
big
tears
ran
out
of
his
big
goggly
eyes
xxi
the
merry
little
breezes
try
to
comfort
grandfather
frog
when
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
had
left
grandfather
frog
in
the
long
lane
where
farmer
brown
boy
had
dropped
him
and
had
hurried
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
to
try
to
find
some
of
his
friends
to
help
him
not
one
of
them
had
been
successful
no
one
was
at
home
and
no
one
was
in
any
of
the
places
where
they
usually
were
to
be
found
the
merry
little
breezes
looked
and
looked
then
one
by
one
they
sadly
turned
back
to
the
long
lane
they
felt
so
badly
that
they
just
hated
to
go
back
where
they
had
left
grandfather
frog
when
they
got
there
they
found
striped
chipmunk
who
now
was
scolding
farmer
brown
boy
as
fast
as
his
tongue
could
go
where
is
he
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
excitedly
striped
chipmunk
stopped
scolding
long
enough
to
point
to
farmer
boy
who
was
hunting
in
the
grass
for
some
trace
of
grandfather
frog
we
do
mean
him
you
stupid
we
can
see
him
for
ourselves
grandfather
frog
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
all
speaking
at
once
i
do
know
replied
striped
chipmunk
and
what
more
i
care
now
this
was
true
for
striped
chipmunk
is
that
kind
it
was
mostly
talk
and
the
merry
little
breezes
knew
it
they
knew
that
striped
chipmunk
really
thinks
a
great
deal
of
grandfather
frog
just
as
they
do
so
they
pretended
not
to
notice
what
he
said
or
how
put
out
he
seemed
after
a
while
he
told
them
that
he
had
set
grandfather
frog
free
and
that
then
he
had
started
for
the
spring
on
the
other
side
of
the
long
lane
the
merry
little
breezes
were
delighted
to
hear
the
good
news
and
they
said
such
a
lot
of
nice
things
to
striped
chipmunk
that
he
quite
forgot
to
scold
farmer
brown
boy
then
they
started
for
the
spring
dancing
merrily
for
they
felt
sure
that
there
grandfather
frog
was
all
right
and
they
expected
to
find
him
quite
at
home
hello
grandfather
frog
they
shouted
as
they
peeped
into
the
spring
how
do
you
like
your
new
home
grandfather
frog
made
no
reply
he
just
rolled
his
great
goggly
eyes
up
at
them
and
they
were
full
of
tears
why
why
why
grandfather
frog
what
is
the
matter
now
they
cried
chugarum
said
grandfather
frog
and
his
voice
sounded
all
choky
i
ca
get
out
then
they
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
straight
and
smooth
the
walls
of
the
spring
were
and
how
far
down
grandfather
frog
was
and
they
knew
that
he
spoke
the
truth
they
tried
bending
down
the
grasses
that
grew
around
the
edge
of
the
spring
but
none
were
long
enough
to
reach
the
water
if
they
had
stopped
to
think
they
would
have
known
that
grandfather
frog
could
have
climbed
up
by
them
anyway
then
they
tried
to
lift
a
big
stick
into
the
spring
but
it
was
too
heavy
for
them
and
they
could
move
it
however
they
did
manage
to
blow
an
old
shingle
in
and
this
gave
grandfather
frog
something
to
sit
on
so
that
he
began
to
feel
a
little
better
then
they
said
all
the
comforting
things
they
could
think
of
they
told
him
that
no
harm
could
come
to
him
there
unless
farmer
brown
boy
should
happen
to
see
him
illustration
that
just
what
i
afraid
of
croaked
grandfather
frog
that
just
what
i
am
afraid
of
croaked
grandfather
frog
he
is
sure
to
see
me
if
he
comes
for
a
drink
for
there
is
no
place
for
me
to
hide
perhaps
he
wo
come
said
one
of
the
little
breezes
hopefully
if
he
does
come
you
can
hide
under
the
piece
of
shingle
and
then
he
wo
know
you
are
here
at
all
said
another
grandfather
frog
brightened
up
that
so
said
he
that
a
good
idea
and
i
try
it
then
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
promised
to
keep
watch
for
farmer
brown
boy
and
all
the
others
started
off
on
another
hunt
for
some
one
to
help
grandfather
frog
out
of
this
new
trouble
xxii
grandfather
frog
troubles
grow
head
first
in
no
way
out
it
best
to
know
what
you
about
grandfather
frog
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
realize
how
very
true
this
is
as
he
sat
on
the
old
shingle
which
the
merry
little
breezes
had
blown
into
the
spring
where
he
was
a
prisoner
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
little
word
if
he
had
left
the
smiling
pool
he
had
been
stubborn
and
set
in
his
ways
he
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
he
had
looked
to
see
where
he
was
leaping
well
any
one
of
these
would
have
kept
him
out
of
his
present
trouble
it
really
was
so
bad
in
the
spring
that
is
it
would
have
been
so
bad
but
for
the
fear
that
farmer
brown
boy
might
come
for
a
drink
and
find
him
there
that
was
grandfather
frog
one
great
fear
and
it
gave
him
bad
dreams
whenever
he
tried
to
take
a
nap
he
grew
cold
all
over
at
the
very
thought
of
being
caught
again
by
farmer
brown
boy
and
when
at
last
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
hurried
up
to
tell
him
that
farmer
brown
boy
actually
was
coming
poor
old
grandfather
frog
was
so
frightened
that
the
merry
little
breeze
had
to
tell
him
twice
to
hide
under
the
old
shingle
as
it
floated
on
the
water
at
last
he
got
it
through
his
head
and
drawing
a
very
long
breath
he
dived
into
the
water
and
swam
under
the
old
shingle
he
was
just
in
time
yes
sir
he
was
just
in
time
if
farmer
brown
boy
had
been
thinking
of
something
else
he
certainly
would
have
noticed
the
little
rings
on
the
water
made
by
grandfather
frog
when
he
dived
in
but
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
it
was
until
he
dipped
a
cup
in
for
the
second
time
that
he
even
saw
the
old
shingle
hello
he
exclaimed
that
must
have
blown
in
since
i
was
here
yesterday
we
ca
have
anything
like
that
in
our
nice
spring
with
that
he
reached
out
for
the
old
shingle
and
grandfather
frog
hiding
under
it
gave
himself
up
for
lost
but
the
anxious
little
breeze
had
been
watching
sharply
and
the
instant
he
saw
what
farmer
brown
boy
was
going
to
do
he
played
the
old
old
trick
of
snatching
his
hat
from
his
head
the
truth
is
he
could
think
of
anything
else
to
do
farmer
brown
boy
grabbed
at
his
hat
and
then
because
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
had
other
things
to
do
he
started
off
without
once
thinking
of
the
old
shingle
again
chugarum
cried
grandfather
frog
as
he
swam
out
from
under
the
shingle
and
climbed
up
on
it
that
certainly
was
a
close
call
if
i
have
many
more
like
it
i
certainly
shall
die
of
fright
nothing
more
happened
for
a
long
time
and
grandfather
frog
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
safe
to
take
a
nap
when
he
saw
peeping
over
the
edge
above
him
two
eyes
they
were
greenish
yellow
eyes
and
they
stared
and
stared
grandfather
frog
stared
and
stared
back
he
just
could
help
it
he
did
know
who
they
belonged
to
he
remember
ever
having
seen
them
before
he
was
afraid
and
yet
somehow
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
jump
he
stared
so
hard
at
the
eyes
that
he
did
notice
a
long
furry
paw
slowly
very
slowly
reaching
down
towards
him
nearer
it
crept
and
nearer
then
suddenly
it
moved
like
a
flash
grandfather
frog
felt
sharp
claws
in
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
and
before
he
could
even
open
his
mouth
to
cry
chugarum
he
was
sent
flying
through
the
air
and
landed
on
his
back
in
the
grass
pounce
two
paws
pinned
him
down
and
the
greenish
yellow
eyes
were
not
an
inch
from
his
own
they
belonged
to
black
pussy
farmer
brown
cat
xxiii
the
dear
old
smiling
pool
once
more
black
pussy
was
having
a
good
time
grandfather
frog
was
it
was
great
fun
for
black
pussy
to
slip
a
paw
under
grandfather
frog
and
toss
him
up
in
the
air
it
was
still
more
fun
to
pretend
to
go
away
but
to
hide
instead
and
the
instant
grandfather
frog
started
off
to
pounce
upon
him
and
cuff
him
and
roll
him
about
but
there
was
any
fun
in
it
for
grandfather
frog
in
the
first
place
he
did
know
whether
or
not
black
pussy
liked
frogs
to
eat
and
he
was
terribly
frightened
in
the
second
place
black
pussy
did
always
cover
up
her
claws
and
they
pricked
right
through
grandfather
frog
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
and
hurt
for
he
is
very
tender
there
at
last
black
pussy
grew
tired
of
playing
so
catching
up
grandfather
frog
in
her
mouth
she
started
along
the
little
path
from
the
spring
to
the
long
lane
grandfather
frog
did
even
kick
which
was
just
as
well
because
if
he
had
black
pussy
would
have
held
him
tighter
and
that
would
have
been
very
uncomfortable
indeed
it
all
over
and
this
is
the
end
moaned
grandfather
frog
going
to
be
eaten
now
oh
why
why
did
i
ever
leave
the
smiling
pool
just
as
black
pussy
slipped
into
the
long
lane
grandfather
frog
heard
a
familiar
sound
it
was
a
whistle
a
merry
whistle
it
was
the
whistle
of
farmer
brown
boy
it
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
a
little
bit
of
hope
began
to
stir
in
the
heart
of
grandfather
frog
he
did
know
just
why
but
it
did
always
he
had
been
in
the
greatest
fear
of
farmer
brown
boy
but
now
well
if
farmer
brown
boy
should
take
him
he
might
get
away
from
him
as
he
did
before
but
he
was
very
sure
that
he
never
never
could
get
away
from
black
pussy
the
whistle
drew
nearer
black
pussy
stopped
then
she
began
to
make
a
queer
whirring
sound
deep
down
in
her
throat
hello
black
pussy
have
you
been
hunting
come
here
and
show
me
what
you
got
cried
a
voice
black
pussy
arched
up
her
back
and
began
to
rub
against
the
legs
of
farmer
brown
boy
and
all
the
time
the
whir
ring
sound
in
her
throat
grew
louder
and
louder
farmer
brown
boy
stooped
down
to
see
what
she
had
in
her
mouth
why
he
exclaimed
i
do
believe
this
is
the
very
same
old
frog
that
got
away
from
me
you
do
want
him
puss
i
just
put
him
in
my
pocket
and
take
him
up
to
the
house
by
and
by
with
that
he
took
grandfather
frog
from
black
pussy
and
dropped
him
in
his
pocket
he
patted
black
pussy
called
her
a
smart
cat
and
then
started
on
his
way
whistling
merrily
it
was
dark
and
rather
close
in
that
pocket
but
grandfather
frog
did
mind
this
it
was
a
lot
better
than
feeling
sharp
teeth
and
claws
all
the
time
he
wondered
how
soon
they
would
reach
the
house
and
what
would
happen
to
him
then
after
what
seemed
like
a
long
long
time
he
felt
himself
swung
through
the
air
and
then
he
landed
on
the
ground
with
a
thump
that
made
him
grunt
farmer
brown
boy
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
thrown
it
down
the
whistling
stopped
everything
was
quiet
grandfather
frog
waited
and
listened
but
not
a
sound
could
he
hear
then
he
saw
a
little
ray
of
light
creeping
into
his
prison
he
squirmed
and
pushed
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
out
of
the
pocket
the
bright
light
made
him
blink
as
soon
as
he
could
see
he
looked
to
see
where
he
was
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
both
hands
and
looked
again
he
was
at
farmer
brown
house
at
all
where
do
you
think
he
was
why
right
on
the
bank
of
the
smiling
pool
and
a
little
way
off
was
farmer
brown
boy
fishing
chugarum
cried
grandfather
frog
and
it
was
the
loudest
gladdest
chugarum
that
the
smiling
pool
ever
had
heard
chugarum
he
cried
again
and
with
a
great
leap
he
dived
with
a
splash
into
the
dear
old
smiling
pool
which
smiled
more
than
ever
and
never
again
has
grandfather
frog
tried
to
see
the
great
world
he
is
quite
content
to
leave
it
to
those
who
like
to
dwell
there
and
since
his
own
wonderful
adventures
he
has
been
ready
to
believe
anything
he
is
told
about
what
happens
there
nothing
can
surprise
him
not
even
the
astonishing
things
that
happened
to
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
about
which
it
takes
a
whole
book
to
tell
