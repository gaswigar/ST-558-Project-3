my
doggie
and
i
by
ballantyne
chapter
one
explains
itself
i
possess
a
doggie
not
a
dog
observe
but
a
doggie
if
he
had
been
a
dog
i
would
not
have
presumed
to
intrude
him
on
your
notice
a
dog
is
all
very
well
in
his
way
one
of
the
noblest
of
animals
i
admit
and
fitted
to
be
the
companion
of
man
for
he
has
an
affectionate
nature
which
man
demands
and
a
forgiving
disposition
which
man
needs
but
a
dog
with
all
his
noble
qualities
is
not
to
be
compared
to
a
doggie
my
doggie
is
unquestionably
the
most
charming
and
in
every
way
delightful
doggie
that
ever
was
born
my
sister
has
a
baby
about
which
she
raves
in
somewhat
similar
terms
but
of
course
that
is
ridiculous
for
her
baby
differs
in
no
particular
from
ordinary
babies
except
perhaps
in
the
matter
of
violent
weeping
of
which
it
is
fond
whereas
my
doggie
is
unique
a
perfectly
beautiful
and
singular
specimen
of
of
well
i
wo
say
what
because
my
friends
usually
laugh
at
me
when
i
say
it
and
i
do
like
to
be
laughed
at
freely
admit
that
you
do
at
once
perceive
the
finer
qualities
either
mental
or
physical
of
my
doggie
partly
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
he
is
shapeless
and
hairy
the
former
quality
is
not
prepossessing
while
the
latter
tends
to
veil
the
amiable
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
lustre
of
his
speaking
eyes
but
as
you
come
to
know
him
he
grows
upon
you
your
feelings
are
touched
your
affections
stirred
and
your
love
is
finally
evoked
as
he
resembles
a
or
rather
a
scrap
of
very
ragged
and
has
an
amiable
spirit
i
have
called
him
dumps
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
you
did
not
perceive
any
connection
here
you
are
not
the
first
who
has
failed
to
see
it
i
never
saw
it
myself
when
i
first
met
dumps
he
was
scurrying
towards
me
along
a
sequestered
country
lane
it
was
in
the
dog
days
dust
lay
thick
on
the
road
the
creature
legs
were
remarkably
short
though
active
and
his
hair
being
long
he
swept
up
the
dust
in
clouds
as
he
ran
he
was
yelping
and
i
observed
that
one
or
two
stones
appeared
to
be
racing
with
or
after
him
the
voice
of
an
angry
man
also
seemed
to
chase
him
but
the
owner
of
the
voice
was
at
the
moment
concealed
by
a
turn
in
the
lane
which
was
bordered
by
high
hydrophobia
of
course
flashed
into
my
mind
i
grasped
my
stick
and
drew
close
to
the
wall
the
hairy
whirlwind
if
i
may
so
call
it
came
wildly
on
but
instead
of
passing
me
or
snapping
at
my
legs
as
i
had
expected
it
stopped
and
crawled
towards
me
in
a
piteous
supplicating
manner
that
at
once
disarmed
me
if
the
creature
had
lain
still
i
should
have
been
unable
to
distinguish
its
head
from
its
tail
but
as
one
end
of
him
whined
and
the
other
wagged
i
had
no
difficulty
stooping
down
with
caution
i
patted
the
end
that
whined
whereupon
the
end
that
wagged
became
violently
demonstrative
just
then
the
owner
of
the
voice
came
round
the
corner
he
was
a
big
rough
fellow
in
ragged
garments
and
armed
with
a
thick
stick
which
he
seemed
about
to
fling
at
the
little
dog
when
i
checked
him
with
a
shout
you
better
not
my
man
unless
you
want
your
own
head
broken
you
see
i
am
a
pretty
man
myself
and
as
i
felt
confidence
in
my
strength
my
stick
and
the
goodness
of
my
cause
i
was
bold
what
mean
by
the
little
dog
i
demanded
sternly
as
i
stepped
up
to
the
man
a
cove
may
do
as
he
likes
with
his
own
may
he
answered
the
man
with
a
sulky
scowl
a
may
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
i
indignantly
for
cruelty
to
dumb
animals
always
has
the
effect
of
inclining
me
to
fight
though
i
am
naturally
of
a
peaceable
disposition
there
is
an
act
of
parliament
i
continued
which
goes
by
the
honoured
name
of
martin
and
if
you
venture
to
infringe
that
act
i
have
you
taken
up
and
prosecuted
while
i
was
speaking
i
observed
a
peculiar
leer
on
the
man
face
which
i
could
not
account
for
he
appeared
however
to
have
been
affected
by
my
threats
for
he
ceased
to
scowl
and
assumed
a
deferential
air
as
he
replied
vell
sir
it
do
seem
raither
that
a
cove
should
be
blowed
up
for
kindness
kindness
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
ay
kindness
sir
that
there
hanimal
loves
me
it
do
like
a
brother
an
the
love
is
mootooal
ve
lived
together
now
off
an
on
for
the
matter
o
six
months
vell
i
gits
employment
in
a
factory
about
fifteen
miles
from
here
in
which
no
dogs
is
allowed
in
coorse
i
ca
throw
up
my
sitivation
sir
can
i
neither
can
my
doggie
give
up
his
master
wot
he
so
fond
of
so
i
obleeged
to
leave
in
charge
of
a
friend
with
stric
orders
to
keep
locked
up
till
i
fairly
gone
vell
off
i
goes
but
he
manages
to
escape
an
runs
arter
me
now
wot
can
a
feller
do
but
drive
with
sticks
an
stones
though
it
do
go
to
my
to
do
it
but
if
he
goes
to
the
factory
sure
to
be
shot
or
scragged
or
drownded
or
somethink
so
you
see
sir
it
out
o
pure
kindness
i
a
peltin
of
confess
that
i
felt
somewhat
doubtful
of
the
truth
of
this
story
but
in
order
to
prevent
any
expression
of
my
face
betraying
me
i
stooped
and
patted
the
dog
while
the
man
spoke
it
received
my
attentions
with
evident
delight
a
thought
suddenly
flashed
on
me
will
you
sell
your
little
dog
i
asked
vy
sir
he
replied
with
some
hesitation
i
do
quite
like
to
do
that
he
such
a
pure
breed
and
and
he
so
fond
o
me
but
have
you
not
told
me
that
you
are
obliged
to
part
with
him
i
thought
the
man
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
turning
to
me
with
a
bland
smile
he
said
ah
sir
i
that
just
where
it
is
i
am
obleeged
to
part
with
him
but
i
ai
obleeged
to
sell
him
if
i
part
with
my
friend
keeps
for
me
and
we
may
meet
again
but
if
i
sell
he
gone
for
ever
do
you
see
if
you
wants
wery
bad
i
do
it
on
one
consideration
and
that
is
that
you
be
good
to
i
began
to
think
i
had
misjudged
the
man
what
his
name
i
asked
again
for
one
moment
there
was
that
strange
puzzled
look
in
the
face
but
it
passed
and
he
turned
with
another
of
his
bland
smiles
his
name
sir
ah
his
name
he
ai
got
no
name
sir
no
name
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
no
sir
i
object
to
givin
dogs
names
on
principle
it
too
much
like
treatin
them
as
if
they
wos
christians
and
you
know
they
could
be
christians
if
they
wanted
to
ever
so
much
besides
wotever
name
you
gives
there
must
be
so
many
other
dogs
with
the
same
name
that
you
stand
a
chance
o
the
wrong
dog
comin
to
ven
you
calls
that
a
strange
reason
how
then
do
you
call
him
to
you
vy
i
wants
i
shouts
or
or
i
vistles
indeed
said
i
somewhat
amused
by
the
humour
of
the
fellow
and
what
do
you
ask
for
him
fi
pun
ten
an
he
dirt
cheap
at
that
was
the
quick
reply
come
come
my
man
you
know
the
dog
is
not
worth
that
not
worth
it
sir
he
replied
with
an
injured
look
i
tell
you
cheap
at
that
look
at
his
breedin
and
then
think
of
his
affectionate
natur
is
the
affections
to
count
for
nuffin
admitted
that
the
affections
were
worth
money
though
it
was
generally
understood
that
they
could
not
be
purchased
but
still
objected
to
the
price
until
the
man
said
in
a
confidential
tone
vell
come
sir
since
you
do
express
such
a
deal
o
love
for
and
promise
to
be
so
good
to
i
make
a
sacrifice
and
let
you
for
three
pun
ten
come
gave
in
and
walked
off
with
my
purchase
leaping
joyfully
at
my
heels
the
man
chuckled
a
good
deal
after
receiving
the
money
but
i
took
no
notice
of
that
at
the
time
though
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
afterwards
ah
little
did
i
think
as
dumps
and
i
walked
home
that
day
of
the
depth
of
the
attachment
that
was
to
spring
up
between
us
the
varied
experiences
of
life
we
were
destined
to
have
together
and
the
important
influence
he
was
to
exercise
on
my
career
forgot
to
mention
that
my
name
is
mellon
john
mellon
dumps
knows
my
name
as
well
as
he
knows
his
own
on
reaching
home
dumps
displayed
an
evidence
of
good
breeding
which
convinced
me
that
he
could
not
have
spent
all
his
puppyhood
in
company
with
the
man
from
whom
i
had
bought
him
he
wiped
his
feet
on
the
with
great
vigour
before
entering
my
house
and
also
refused
to
pass
in
until
i
led
the
way
now
dumps
said
i
seating
myself
on
the
sofa
in
my
solitary
room
i
was
a
bachelor
at
the
time
a
medical
student
just
on
the
point
of
completing
my
course
come
here
and
let
us
have
a
talk
to
my
surprise
the
doggie
came
promptly
forward
sat
down
on
his
and
looked
up
into
my
face
i
was
touched
by
this
display
of
ready
confidence
a
confiding
nature
has
always
been
to
me
powerfully
attractive
whether
in
child
cat
or
dog
i
brushed
the
shaggy
hair
from
his
face
in
order
to
see
his
eyes
they
were
moist
and
intensely
black
so
was
the
point
of
his
nose
you
seem
to
be
an
affectionate
doggie
dumps
a
portion
of
hair
scarce
worthy
the
name
of
tail
wagged
as
i
spoke
and
he
attempted
to
lick
my
fingers
but
i
prevented
this
by
patting
his
head
i
have
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
licking
perhaps
having
received
more
than
an
average
allowance
in
another
sense
at
school
may
account
for
my
dislike
to
it
even
from
a
dog
now
dumps
i
continued
you
and
i
are
to
be
good
friends
bought
you
for
a
pretty
large
sum
too
let
me
tell
you
from
a
man
who
i
am
quite
sure
treated
you
ill
and
i
intend
to
show
you
what
good
treatment
is
but
there
are
two
things
i
mean
to
insist
on
and
it
is
well
that
we
should
understand
each
other
at
the
outset
of
our
united
career
you
must
never
bark
at
my
friends
not
even
at
my
enemies
when
they
come
to
see
me
and
you
must
not
beg
at
meals
understand
the
way
in
which
that
shaggy
creature
cocked
its
ears
and
turned
its
head
from
side
to
side
slowly
and
gazed
with
its
lustrous
eyes
while
i
was
speaking
went
far
to
convince
me
it
really
did
understand
what
i
said
of
course
it
only
wagged
its
rear
tuft
of
hair
in
reply
and
whimpered
slightly
refer
to
its
rear
tuft
advisedly
because
at
a
short
distance
my
doggie
when
in
repose
resembled
an
elongated
and
shapeless
mass
but
when
roused
by
a
call
or
otherwise
three
tufts
of
hair
instantly
sprang
up
two
at
one
end
and
one
at
the
other
end
indicating
his
ears
and
tail
it
was
only
by
these
signs
that
i
could
ascertain
at
any
time
his
exact
position
i
was
about
to
continue
my
remarks
to
dumps
when
the
door
opened
and
my
landlady
appeared
bearing
the
dinner
tray
oh
i
beg
parding
sir
she
said
drawing
back
i
did
your
voice
sir
till
the
door
was
open
an
i
thought
you
was
alone
but
i
can
come
back
a
come
in
mrs
miff
there
is
nobody
here
but
my
little
dog
one
that
i
have
just
bought
a
rather
shaggy
terrier
what
do
you
think
of
him
do
bite
sir
inquired
mrs
miff
in
some
anxiety
as
she
passed
round
the
table
at
a
respectful
distance
from
dumps
i
think
not
he
seems
an
amiable
creature
said
i
patting
his
head
do
you
ever
bite
dumps
well
sir
i
never
feel
quite
easy
rejoined
mrs
miff
in
a
doubtful
tone
as
she
laid
my
cloth
with
as
it
were
one
eye
ever
on
the
alert
you
never
knows
these
creatures
is
goin
to
fly
at
you
if
you
could
see
their
heyes
you
might
a
guess
what
they
was
a
thinkin
of
an
then
it
is
so
orkard
not
knowin
end
of
the
bundle
is
the
bitin
end
you
ca
help
bein
nervish
a
little
having
finished
laying
the
cloth
mrs
miff
backed
out
of
the
room
after
the
manner
of
attendants
on
royalty
overturning
two
chairs
with
her
skirts
as
she
went
and
showing
her
full
front
to
the
enemy
but
the
enemy
gave
no
sign
good
or
bad
all
the
tufts
were
down
flat
and
he
stood
motionless
while
mrs
miff
retreated
dumps
what
do
you
think
of
mrs
miff
the
doggie
ran
to
me
at
once
and
we
engaged
in
a
little
further
conversation
until
my
landlady
returned
with
the
viands
to
my
surprise
dumps
at
once
walked
sedately
to
the
and
lay
down
thereon
with
his
chin
on
his
paws
at
least
i
judged
so
from
the
attitude
for
i
could
see
neither
chin
nor
paws
this
act
i
regarded
as
another
evidence
of
good
breeding
he
was
not
a
beggar
and
therefore
could
not
have
spent
his
childhood
with
the
man
from
whom
i
had
bought
him
i
wish
you
could
speak
dumps
said
i
laying
down
my
knife
and
fork
when
about
half
finished
and
looking
towards
the
one
end
of
him
rose
a
little
the
other
end
wagged
gently
but
as
i
made
no
further
remark
both
ends
subsided
now
dumps
said
i
finishing
my
meal
with
a
draught
of
water
which
is
my
favourite
beverage
you
must
not
suppose
that
you
have
got
a
greedy
master
though
i
do
allow
begging
there
sir
is
your
corner
where
you
shall
always
have
the
remnants
of
my
dinner
come
the
dog
did
not
move
until
i
said
come
then
with
a
quick
rush
he
made
for
the
plate
and
very
soon
cleared
it
well
you
have
been
well
trained
said
i
regarding
him
with
interest
such
conduct
is
neither
the
result
of
instinct
nor
accident
and
sure
am
i
the
more
i
think
of
it
that
the
sulky
fellow
who
sold
you
to
me
was
not
your
tutor
but
as
you
ca
speak
i
shall
never
find
out
your
history
so
dumps
i
dismiss
the
subject
saying
this
i
sat
down
to
the
newspaper
with
which
i
invariably
solaced
myself
for
half
an
hour
after
dinner
before
going
out
on
my
afternoon
rounds
this
was
the
manner
in
which
my
doggie
and
i
began
our
acquaintance
and
i
have
been
thus
particular
in
recounting
the
details
because
they
bear
in
a
special
manner
on
some
of
the
most
important
events
of
my
life
being
as
already
mentioned
a
medical
student
and
having
almost
completed
my
course
of
study
i
had
undertaken
to
visit
in
one
of
the
poorest
districts
in
london
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitechapel
partly
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
experience
in
my
profession
and
partly
for
the
sake
of
carrying
the
word
of
life
the
knowledge
of
the
saviour
into
some
of
the
many
homes
where
moral
as
well
as
physical
disease
is
rife
leanings
and
inclinations
are
inherited
not
less
than
bodily
peculiarities
my
father
had
a
particular
tenderness
for
poor
old
women
of
the
lowest
class
so
have
i
when
i
see
a
bowed
aged
wrinkled
feeble
woman
in
rags
and
dirt
a
gush
of
tender
pity
almost
irresistibly
inclines
me
to
go
and
pat
her
head
sit
down
beside
her
comfort
her
and
give
her
money
it
matters
not
what
her
antecedents
may
have
been
worthy
or
unworthy
there
she
stands
now
with
age
helplessness
and
a
hopeless
temporal
future
pleading
more
eloquently
in
her
behalf
than
could
the
tongue
of
man
or
angel
true
the
same
plea
is
equally
applicable
to
poor
old
men
but
reader
i
write
not
at
present
of
principles
so
much
as
of
feelings
my
weakness
is
old
women
accordingly
on
my
professional
visiting
list
i
had
at
that
time
a
considerable
number
of
these
one
of
them
who
was
uncommonly
small
unusually
miserable
and
pathetically
feeble
lay
heavy
on
my
spirit
just
then
she
had
a
remarkably
bad
cold
at
the
time
which
betrayed
itself
chiefly
in
a
frequent
but
feeble
sneeze
as
i
rose
to
go
out
and
looked
at
my
doggie
who
was
or
seemed
to
be
asleep
on
the
rug
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
that
poor
old
creature
i
muttered
is
very
lonely
in
her
garret
a
little
dog
might
comfort
her
perhaps
but
no
dumps
you
are
too
lively
for
her
too
bouncing
she
would
require
something
feeble
and
affectionate
like
herself
come
i
think
of
that
so
my
doggie
you
shall
keep
watch
here
until
i
return
chapter
two
introduces
a
young
hero
the
day
had
become
very
sultry
by
the
time
i
went
out
to
visit
my
patients
the
sky
was
overcast
with
dark
thunderous
clouds
and
as
there
seemed
every
chance
of
a
heavy
shower
i
returned
to
my
lodgings
for
an
umbrella
oh
mr
mellon
exclaimed
my
landlady
as
i
entered
the
lobby
was
there
ever
a
greater
blessin
oh
why
what
the
matter
mrs
miff
oh
sir
that
little
dog
as
you
brought
gone
mad
is
that
the
blessing
you
refer
to
mrs
miff
no
sir
but
your
comin
back
is
for
the
creetur
bin
round
the
room
an
yellin
like
a
thing
possessed
by
demons
i
so
glad
you
come
feeling
sure
that
the
little
dog
unaccustomed
perhaps
to
be
left
alone
in
a
strange
place
was
merely
anxious
to
be
free
i
at
once
went
to
my
and
opened
it
dumps
bounced
out
and
danced
joyfully
round
me
mrs
miff
fled
in
deadly
silence
to
her
own
bedroom
where
she
locked
and
bolted
herself
in
dumps
said
i
with
a
laugh
i
shall
have
to
take
you
with
me
at
the
risk
of
losing
you
perhaps
the
memory
of
the
feed
i
given
you
and
the
hope
of
another
may
keep
you
by
me
come
we
shall
see
my
doggie
behaved
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
he
did
indeed
stop
at
several
butchers
shops
during
our
walk
and
looked
inquiringly
in
he
also
evinced
a
desire
to
enter
into
conversation
with
one
or
two
other
sociable
dogs
but
the
briefest
chirp
or
whistle
brought
him
at
once
obediently
to
my
heel
just
as
if
he
had
known
and
obeyed
me
all
his
life
when
we
reached
the
poorer
parts
of
the
city
i
observed
that
the
swagger
and
the
jaunty
hopping
of
each
alternately
gave
place
to
a
sedate
walk
and
a
wary
turn
of
the
head
which
suggested
keen
suspicious
glances
of
the
unseen
eyes
ah
thought
i
evidently
he
has
suffered
hardships
and
bad
treatment
in
places
like
this
i
stooped
and
patted
his
head
he
drew
closer
to
me
as
if
seeking
protection
just
then
a
low
grumbling
of
thunder
was
heard
and
soon
after
the
rain
came
down
so
heavily
that
the
umbrella
forming
an
insufficient
protection
dumps
and
i
sought
shelter
in
the
mouth
of
an
alley
the
plump
was
and
the
little
knots
of
people
who
had
sought
shelter
along
with
us
melted
quickly
away
my
doggie
aspect
was
not
improved
by
this
shower
it
had
caused
his
hairy
coat
to
cling
to
his
form
producing
a
aspect
which
was
not
becoming
but
a
short
run
and
some
vigorous
shakes
soon
restored
his
rotundity
in
a
few
minutes
thereafter
we
reached
a
narrow
square
or
court
at
the
end
of
a
very
dirty
locality
in
one
corner
of
which
was
a
low
through
the
could
be
seen
the
usual
melancholy
crowd
of
unhappy
creatures
who
had
either
already
come
under
the
full
influence
and
curse
of
strong
drink
or
were
far
on
the
road
to
ruin
it
was
a
sight
with
which
i
had
become
so
familiar
that
sad
though
it
was
i
scarce
gave
it
a
thought
in
passing
my
mind
was
occupied
with
the
poor
old
woman
i
was
about
to
visit
and
i
would
have
taken
no
further
notice
of
the
in
question
if
the
door
had
not
opened
violently
and
a
dirty
ragged
or
waif
apparently
about
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
rushed
out
with
a
wild
cry
that
may
be
described
as
a
compound
he
came
out
in
such
blind
haste
that
he
ran
his
ragged
head
with
great
violence
against
my
side
and
almost
overturned
me
hallo
youngster
i
exclaimed
sternly
hallo
oldster
he
replied
in
a
tone
of
the
most
insolent
indignation
wot
ever
do
you
mean
by
runnin
agin
my
like
that
hai
you
got
no
genteel
boys
in
the
to
butt
agin
that
you
come
all
the
way
to
vitechapel
to
butt
agin
i
a
good
mind
to
you
over
to
the
come
you
owes
me
a
copper
for
that
the
ineffable
insolence
of
this
waif
took
me
quite
by
surprise
he
spoke
with
extreme
volubility
and
assumed
the
commanding
air
of
a
man
of
though
only
a
boy
of
i
observed
however
that
he
kept
at
a
sufficient
distance
to
make
sure
of
escaping
in
the
event
of
my
trying
to
seize
him
come
said
i
with
a
smile
i
think
you
rather
owe
me
a
copper
for
giving
me
such
a
punch
in
the
ribs
vell
i
do
mind
lookin
at
it
in
that
light
he
replied
returning
my
smile
i
give
you
a
copper
i
hai
got
change
you
would
mind
comin
into
this
while
i
git
change
would
you
or
if
you
lend
me
a
sixpence
i
go
in
and
git
it
for
you
no
said
i
putting
my
fingers
into
my
waistcoat
pocket
but
here
is
a
sixpence
for
you
which
you
may
keep
and
never
mind
the
change
if
you
walk
along
the
streets
with
me
a
bit
the
urchin
held
out
his
dirty
hand
and
i
put
the
coin
into
it
he
smiled
tossed
the
sixpence
caught
it
deftly
and
transferred
it
to
his
right
trousers
pocket
vell
you
are
a
rum
but
i
say
all
square
no
dodges
honour
bright
no
dodges
honour
bright
i
replied
come
along
at
this
point
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sudden
change
in
the
behaviour
of
dumps
he
went
cautiously
towards
the
boy
and
snuffed
as
him
for
a
moment
i
say
is
he
wicious
he
asked
backing
a
little
i
think
not
but
i
was
checked
in
my
speech
by
the
little
dog
uttering
a
whine
of
delight
and
suddenly
dancing
round
the
boy
wagging
its
tail
violently
and
indeed
wriggling
its
whole
shapeless
body
with
joy
as
some
dogs
are
wont
to
do
when
they
meet
with
an
old
friend
unexpectedly
why
he
seems
to
know
you
said
i
in
surprise
vell
he
do
seem
to
the
honour
of
my
acquaintance
returned
the
boy
whose
tone
of
banter
quickly
passed
away
what
call
dumps
said
i
that
wo
do
has
he
a
vite
spot
on
the
bridge
of
nose
asked
the
boy
earnestly
i
really
can
not
tell
it
is
not
long
here
punch
come
here
called
the
boy
interrupting
at
the
name
of
punch
my
doggie
became
so
demonstrative
in
his
affections
that
he
all
but
leaped
into
the
boy
arms
whined
lovingly
and
licked
his
dirty
face
all
over
the
wery
dog
said
the
boy
after
looking
at
his
nose
only
growed
so
big
that
his
own
mother
would
know
vy
where
you
bin
all
this
long
while
punch
mean
to
say
that
you
know
the
dog
and
that
his
name
is
punch
vell
you
green
would
any
cove
with
half
an
eye
see
that
the
dog
knows
me
an
so
in
course
i
must
know
an
ven
i
called
punch
did
he
answer
hey
i
was
obliged
to
admit
the
truth
of
these
remarks
after
the
first
ebullition
of
joy
at
the
meeting
was
over
we
went
along
the
street
together
then
the
dog
is
yours
said
i
as
we
went
along
no
he
ai
mine
he
was
mine
once
ven
he
was
a
pup
but
i
sold
to
a
young
lady
for
a
small
sum
for
how
much
i
asked
for
five
bob
yes
five
bob
i
axed
vun
pound
but
the
young
lady
was
so
pleasant
an
pritty
that
i
come
down
to
ten
bob
then
she
said
she
was
poor
and
to
tell
the
plain
truth
she
looked
like
it
an
she
wanted
the
pup
so
bad
that
i
come
down
to
five
and
who
was
this
young
lady
blow
if
i
knows
she
went
off
wi
my
punch
an
i
never
saw
more
then
you
do
know
what
induced
her
to
sell
punch
to
a
low
fellow
but
of
course
you
know
nothing
about
that
said
i
in
a
musing
tone
as
i
thought
of
the
strange
manner
in
which
this
portion
of
my
history
had
come
to
light
but
i
was
recalled
from
my
reverie
by
the
contemptuous
tones
of
my
little
companion
voice
as
he
said
but
i
know
something
about
that
oh
indeed
i
thought
you
said
you
never
saw
the
young
lady
again
no
more
i
did
neither
did
i
ever
see
punch
again
till
but
i
know
for
certain
that
my
young
lady
never
sold
no
dog
wotsomedever
to
no
feller
as
ever
walked
in
shoe
leather
or
out
of
it
ah
i
see
said
i
slowly
you
mean
yes
out
with
it
that
just
wot
i
do
mean
that
the
low
feller
prigged
the
pup
from
her
an
i
vish
as
i
a
grip
of
his
ugly
nose
and
i
draw
it
out
from
his
uglier
face
i
would
like
the
small
end
of
a
telescope
and
then
shut
it
up
flat
again
so
flat
that
never
know
he
had
no
nose
at
all
my
little
companion
then
willingly
gave
me
an
account
of
all
he
knew
about
the
early
history
of
my
doggie
the
story
was
not
long
but
it
began
so
to
speak
at
the
beginning
punch
or
dumps
as
i
continued
to
call
him
had
been
born
in
a
dry
which
stood
in
a
back
yard
near
the
thames
this
yard
was
or
had
been
used
for
putting
away
lumber
it
was
a
queer
place
said
my
little
companion
looking
up
in
my
face
with
a
droll
expression
a
sort
o
place
that
when
once
you
had
gone
into
it
you
was
sure
to
wish
you
had
talk
o
the
blues
sir
i
do
assure
that
i
used
to
go
into
that
yard
of
a
night
it
gave
me
the
it
did
there
was
a
mouldiness
an
a
soppiness
about
it
that
beat
the
katticombs
all
to
sticks
it
looked
like
a
place
that
some
rubbish
had
bin
flung
into
in
the
days
before
adam
an
eve
was
born
an
been
forgotten
from
that
time
to
this
oh
it
was
awful
used
to
make
my
marrow
screw
up
into
lumps
i
was
used
to
go
there
but
why
did
you
go
there
at
all
if
you
disliked
it
so
much
i
asked
vy
because
i
got
no
better
place
to
go
to
i
was
used
to
sleep
there
i
slep
in
the
where
punch
was
born
that
i
come
to
scrape
acquaintance
with

to

gratified
doggie

tired

as

but
no
sooner

i
put
my
head
in
than
out
came
a
most
awful
growl
the
butt
lay
on
its
side
and
i
backed
out
double
quick
just
in
time
for
a
most
terrier
dog

at
me

used
to

a
clip
with
one
o
my
feet

mother
on

dead
pups
and
one
alive
so
i
pitched
the
dead
ones
away
an
shoved
the
live
one
into
the
breast
of
my
coat
where
he
slep
till

so
comfortable

an
was
such
a
queer
critter
that
i
called
him
punch
became
a
father
to
i
got
him
bones
an
other
bits
o
grub
kep
in
the
for
three
veeks
then
he
began
to
make
a
noise
i
left
him
so
bein
sure
the
bobbies
would
rout
out
at
last
i
took
an
sold
to
the
first
pleasant
lady
that
seemed
to
fancy
well
slidder
said
i
as
we
turned
down
into
the
alley
where
mrs
willis
my
little
old
woman
dwelt
i
am
greatly
interested
in
what
you
have
told
me
about
my
little
dog
and
i
am
interested
still
more
in
what
you
have
told
me
about
yourself
now
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
i
wish
you
to
go
with
me
to
visit
an
old
woman
and
after
that
to
walk
home
with
me
part
of
the
way
at
least
the
boy
whose
pinched
face
had
an
expression
of
almost
supernatural
intelligence
on
it
bestowed
on
me
a
quick
earnest
glance
no
dodges
honour
bright
you
ai
a
buffer
he
asked
no
dodges
honour
bright
i
replied
with
a
smile
vell
then
heave
ahead
an
i
foller
we
passed
quickly
down
to
the
lower
end
of
the
alley
which
seemed
to
lose
itself
in
a
wretched
court
that
appeared
as
if
it
intended
to
slip
into
the
river
an
intention
which
if
carried
out
would
have
vastly
improved
its
sanitary
condition
here
in
a
somewhat
dark
corner
of
the
court
i
entered
an
open
door
ascended
a
flight
of
stairs
and
gained
a
second
landing
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
passage
i
stopped
at
a
door
and
knocked
several
of
the
other
doors
of
the
passage
opened
and
various
heads
were
thrust
out
while
inquisitive
eyes
surveyed
me
and
my
companion
a
short
survey
seemed
to
suffice
for
the
doors
were
soon
shut
one
after
another
with
a
bang
but
the
door
at
which
i
knocked
did
not
open
lifting
the
latch
i
entered
and
observed
that
mrs
willis
was
seated
by
the
window
looking
wistfully
out
being
rather
deaf
she
had
not
heard
my
knock
come
in
i
whispered
to
little
slidder
sit
down
on
this
stool
near
the
door
and
keep
quiet
until
i
speak
to
you
so
saying
i
advanced
to
the
window
the
view
was
not
interesting
it
consisted
of
the
side
of
a
house
about
three
feet
distant
down
which
ran
a
or
which
slightly
relieved
the
dead
look
of
the
bricks
from
one
pane
of
the
window
it
was
possible
by
squeezing
your
cheek
against
it
to
obtain
a
perspective
view
of
by
a
stretch
of
the
neck
upwards
you
could
see
more
chimney
pots
by
a
stretch
of
imagination
you
could
see
cats
quarrelling
around
them
or
anything
else
you
pleased
sitting
down
on
a
rickety
chair
beside
the
little
old
woman
i
touched
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
she
had
come
to
know
my
touch
by
that
time
i
think
for
she
looked
round
with
a
bright
little
smile
chapter
three
treats
of
an
old
heroine
it
was
pleasant
yet
sad
to
observe
the
smile
with
which
old
mrs
willis
greeted
me
pleasant
because
it
proved
that
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
me
sad
because
it
was
not
quite
in
keeping
with
the
careworn
old
face
whose
set
wrinkles
it
deranged
i
knew
you
would
come
you
never
miss
the
day
she
said
both
words
and
tone
showing
that
she
had
fallen
from
a
much
higher
position
in
the
social
scale
it
costs
me
little
to
visit
you
once
a
week
dear
mrs
willis
i
replied
and
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
besides
i
am
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
society
which
grants
your
annuity
to
call
personally
and
pay
it
i
only
wish
it
were
a
larger
sum
large
enough
more
than
i
deserve
said
the
old
woman
in
a
low
tone
as
she
gazed
somewhat
vacantly
at
the
dead
wall
opposite
and
let
her
eyes
slowly
descend
the
spout
the
view
was
not
calculated
to
distract
or
dissipate
the
mind
the
bricks
were
so
much
alike
that
the
eye
naturally
sought
and
reposed
on
or
followed
the
salient
feature
having
descended
the
spout
as
far
as
the
permitted
the
eyes
of
mrs
willis
slowly
reascended
as
far
as
possible
and
then
turned
with
a
meek
expression
to
my
face
more
than
i
deserve
she
repeated
and
as
much
as
i
require
it
is
very
kind
of
the
society
to
give
it
and
of
you
to
bring
it
may
god
bless
you
both
ah
doctor
i
often
puzzled
by
eh
that
the
sudden
question
anxiously
asked
was
accompanied
by
a
feeble
attempt
to
gather
her
poor
garments
close
round
her
feet
as
dumps
sniffed
at
her
skirts
and
agitated
his
ridiculous
tail
it
only
my
dog
granny
i
had
of
late
adopted
this
term
of
endearment
a
very
quiet
creature
i
assure
you
that
seems
too
amiable
to
bite
why
he
appears
to
have
a
tendency
to
claim
acquaintance
with
everybody
i
do
believe
he
knows
no
no
he
does
put
him
out
pray
put
him
out
said
the
old
woman
in
alarm
grieved
that
i
had
unintentionally
roused
her
fear
i
opened
the
door
and
called
dumps
my
doggie
rose
with
his
three
indicators
erect
and
expectant
go
out
sir
and
lie
down
the
indicators
slowly
drooped
and
dumps
crawled
past
in
abject
humility
shutting
the
door
i
returned
i
hope
you
do
dislike
little
boys
as
well
as
little
dogs
granny
because
i
have
brought
one
to
wait
for
me
here
you
wo
mind
his
sitting
at
the
door
until
i
go
no
no
said
mrs
willis
quickly
i
like
little
boys
when
when
they
good
she
added
after
a
pause
say
i
one
o
the
good
sort
sir
suggested
slidder
in
a
hoarse
whisper
of
course
it
ai
true
but
wot
o
that
if
it
relieves
her
mind
taking
no
notice
of
this
remark
i
again
sat
down
beside
my
old
woman
what
were
you
going
to
say
about
being
puzzled
granny
puzzled
doctor
did
i
say
i
was
puzzled
yes
but
pray
do
call
me
doctor
i
not
quite
fledged
yet
you
know
call
me
mellon
or
john
well
you
were
saying
oh
i
remember
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
i
been
puzzled
a
good
deal
of
late
by
that
text
in
which
david
says
have
never
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
bread
now
my
father
and
mother
were
both
good
christians
and
although
i
can
not
claim
to
be
a
one
myself
i
do
claim
to
be
a
poor
follower
of
jesus
yet
here
am
i
she
paused
well
granny
said
i
are
you
forsaken
nay
john
god
forbid
that
i
should
say
so
but
am
i
not
a
beggar
ah
pride
pride
you
are
hard
to
kill
you
a
beggar
i
asked
in
a
tone
of
surprise
when
did
you
beg
last
granny
is
not
a
recipient
of
charity
a
beggar
no
i
replied
stoutly
he
is
not
a
solicitor
of
charity
is
a
beggar
but
a
recipient
thereof
is
not
in
your
case
it
was
i
who
was
the
beggar
do
you
not
remember
when
i
found
you
first
without
a
crust
in
the
house
how
i
had
to
beg
and
entreat
you
to
allow
me
to
put
your
name
on
this
charity
and
how
you
persistently
refused
until
at
last
i
did
it
without
your
consent
and
how
eventually
you
gave
in
only
when
i
charged
you
with
pride
you
are
not
forsaken
granny
and
you
are
not
a
beggar
brayvo
doctor
you
have
there
came
in
a
soft
whisper
from
the
door
for
a
moment
i
felt
tempted
to
turn
the
boy
out
as
i
had
turned
out
the
dog
but
seeing
that
my
old
woman
had
not
overheard
the
remark
i
took
no
notice
of
it
you
have
put
the
matter
in
a
new
light
john
said
mrs
willis
slowly
as
her
eyes
once
more
sought
the
spout
you
often
put
things
in
new
lights
and
there
does
seem
some
truth
in
what
you
say
it
did
hurt
my
pride
at
first
but
i
gettin
used
to
it
now
besides
continued
the
old
lady
with
a
deep
sigh
that
trouble
and
everything
else
is
swallowed
up
in
the
great
sorrow
of
my
life
ah
you
refer
to
your
granddaughter
i
suppose
said
i
in
a
tone
of
profound
sympathy
you
have
never
told
me
about
her
dear
granny
if
it
is
not
too
painful
a
subject
to
speak
of
i
should
like
to
hear
about
her
when
did
she
die
die
exclaimed
mrs
willis
with
a
burst
of
energy
that
surprised
me
she
did
not
die
she
left
me
many
many
months
ago
it
seems
like
years
now
my
edie
went
out
one
afternoon
to
walk
like
a
beautiful
sunbeam
as
she
always
was
and
and
she
never
came
back
never
came
back
i
echoed
in
surprise
no
never
i
was
not
able
to
walk
then
any
more
than
now
else
i
would
have
ranged
london
all
round
day
and
night
for
my
darling
as
it
was
a
kind
city
missionary
made
inquiries
at
all
the
and
everywhere
else
he
could
think
of
but
no
clew
could
be
gained
as
to
what
had
become
of
her
at
last
he
got
wearied
out
and
gave
it
up
no
wonder
he
had
never
seen
edie
and
could
not
love
her
as
i
did
once
he
thought
he
had
discovered
her
the
body
of
a
poor
girl
had
been
found
in
the
river
which
he
thought
answered
to
her
description
i
thought
so
too
when
he
told
me
what
she
was
like
and
at
once
concluded
she
had
tumbled
in
by
accident
and
been
drowned
for
you
see
my
edie
was
good
and
pure
and
true
she
could
not
have
committed
suicide
unless
her
mind
had
become
deranged
and
there
was
nothing
that
i
knew
of
to
bring
about
that
they
got
me
with
much
trouble
into
a
cab
and
drove
me
to
the
place
ah
the
poor
thing
she
was
fair
and
sweet
to
look
upon
with
her
curling
brown
hair
and
a
smile
still
on
the
parted
lips
as
if
she
had
welcomed
death
but
she
was
not
my
edie
for
months
and
months
after
that
i
waited
and
waited
feeling
sure
that
she
would
come
then
i
was
forced
to
leave
my
lodging
the
landlord
wanted
it
himself
i
begged
that
he
would
let
me
remain
but
he
would
not
he
was
a
dissipated
man
i
took
another
lodging
but
it
was
a
long
way
off
and
left
my
name
and
new
address
at
the
old
one
my
heart
sank
after
that
and
and
i
no
hope
now
no
hope
my
darling
must
have
met
with
an
accident
in
this
terrible
city
she
must
have
been
killed
and
will
never
come
back
to
me
the
poor
creature
uttered
a
low
wail
and
put
a
handkerchief
to
her
old
eyes
but
bless
the
lord
she
added
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
i
will
go
to
her
soon
for
some
minutes
i
knew
not
what
to
say
in
reply
by
way
of
comforting
my
poor
old
friend
the
case
seemed
indeed
so
hopeless
i
could
only
press
her
hand
but
my
nature
is
naturally
buoyant
and
ready
to
hope
against
hope
even
when
distress
assails
myself
do
not
say
there
is
no
hope
granny
said
i
at
last
making
an
effort
to
be
cheerful
you
know
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
it
may
be
that
this
missionary
did
not
go
the
right
way
to
work
in
his
search
however
good
his
intentions
might
have
been
i
confess
i
can
not
imagine
how
it
is
possible
that
any
girl
should
disappear
in
this
way
unless
she
had
deliberately
gone
off
with
some
one
no
john
my
edie
would
not
have
left
me
thus
of
her
own
free
will
said
the
old
woman
with
a
look
of
assurance
which
showed
that
her
mind
was
immovably
fixed
as
to
that
point
well
then
i
continued
loving
you
as
you
say
she
did
and
being
incapable
of
leaving
you
deliberately
and
without
a
word
of
explanation
it
follows
that
that
i
stopped
for
at
this
point
no
plausible
reason
for
the
disappearance
suggested
itself
it
follows
that
she
must
have
been
killed
said
the
old
woman
in
a
low
broken
tone
no
granny
i
will
not
admit
come
cheer
up
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
inquiries
about
her
and
as
i
have
had
considerable
experience
in
making
investigations
among
the
poor
of
london
perhaps
i
may
fall
on
some
clew
she
would
be
sure
to
have
made
inquiries
would
she
not
at
your
old
lodging
if
she
had
felt
disposed
to
return
felt
disposed
repeated
mrs
willis
with
a
strange
laugh
if
she
return
you
mean
well
if
she
could
said
i
no
doubt
she
would
but
soon
after
i
left
my
old
lodging
the
landlord
fled
the
country
and
other
people
came
to
the
house
who
were
troubled
by
my
sending
so
often
to
inquire
then
my
money
was
all
expended
and
i
had
to
quit
my
second
lodging
and
came
here
which
is
far
far
from
the
old
lodging
and
now
i
have
no
one
to
send
have
you
any
friends
in
london
i
asked
no
we
had
come
from
york
to
try
to
find
teaching
for
my
darling
for
we
could
get
none
in
our
native
town
and
we
had
not
been
long
enough
in
london
to
make
new
friends
when
when
she
went
away
my
dear
ann
and
willie
her
mother
and
father
died
last
year
and
now
we
have
no
near
relations
in
the
world
shall
i
read
to
you
granny
said
i
feeling
that
no
words
of
mine
could
do
much
to
comfort
one
in
so
sad
a
case
she
readily
assented
i
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
and
praying
with
her
during
these
visits
i
turned
without
any
definite
intention
of
doing
so
to
the
words
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
i
can
not
tell
why
but
i
paused
here
instead
of
reading
on
or
commenting
on
the
words
the
old
woman
looked
earnestly
at
me
these
words
she
said
have
been
in
my
mind
all
yesterday
and
the
day
before
i
have
been
greatly
comforted
by
them
because
is
faithful
who
has
promised
pray
over
them
john
do
read
any
more
i
knelt
by
the
poor
woman
chair
she
could
not
kneel
with
me
in
body
though
she
did
in
spirit
i
doubt
not
i
had
quite
forgotten
slidder
but
on
rising
observed
that
he
had
followed
my
example
and
gone
down
on
his
knees
were
you
praying
with
us
slidder
i
asked
after
we
left
mrs
willis
and
were
walking
up
the
alley
followed
by
dumps
dun
know
sir
i
never
heard
nor
seen
nuffin
o
this
sort
before
in
coorse
i
heard
the
missionaries
sometimes
about
the
streets
but
i
never
worrited
myself
about
i
say
doctor
that
a
rum
go
about
that
gal
edie
ai
it
i
quite
took
a
fancy
to
that
gal
now
though
i
ai
seen
her
d
think
she
bin
drownded
i
scarce
know
what
to
think
her
disappearance
so
suddenly
does
seem
very
strange
i
fear
i
fear
much
that
however
it
of
no
use
guessing
i
shall
at
once
set
about
making
inquiries
ha
so
shall
i
said
the
little
waif
with
a
look
of
determination
on
his
small
face
that
amused
me
greatly
for
she
a
good
gal
is
edie
if
she
ai
drownded
why
boy
how
can
you
know
whether
the
girl
is
good
or
bad
how
can
i
know
he
echoed
with
a
glance
of
almost
superhuman
wisdom
in
coorse
i
know
by
the
powers
of
obserwation
that
old
gal
mrs
willis
is
a
good
old
thing
as
good
as
gold
vell
a
good
mother
is
always
cocksure
to
a
good
darter
specially
ven
she
a
only
darter
so
the
mother
o
edie
bein
good
edie
herself
be
good
do
you
see
anythink
as
belonged
to
mrs
willis
ca
help
good
i
glad
you
took
me
to
see
her
doctor
for
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
that
old
up
as
the
bobbies
say
they
wexed
with
avin
nuffin
to
do
strut
about
the
streets
like
i
take
up
and
do
for
i
will
on
questioning
him
further
i
found
that
this
ragged
and
homeless
little
waif
had
indeed
been
touched
by
mrs
willis
sad
story
and
drawn
towards
her
by
her
soft
gentle
nature
so
different
from
what
he
had
hitherto
met
with
in
his
wanderings
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
offer
her
his
gratuitous
services
as
a
and
general
servant
without
requiring
either
food
or
lodging
in
return
but
mrs
willis
may
object
to
such
a
dirty
ragged
fellow
coming
about
her
said
i
ai
there
no
pumps
in
london
stoopid
said
slidder
with
a
look
of
pity
no
soap
true
i
replied
with
a
laugh
but
you
require
needles
and
thread
and
cloth
in
addition
to
make
yourself
respectable
nothink
of
the
sort
i
can
beg
or
borrer
or
steal
coats
and
pants
you
know
ah
slidder
said
i
in
a
kind
but
serious
tone
doubtless
you
can
but
begging
or
borrowing
are
not
likely
to
succeed
and
stealing
is
wrong
think
so
returned
the
boy
with
a
look
of
innocent
surprise
do
you
think
now
that
in
a
good
cause
a
cove
might
wot
is
an
risk
his
bein
sent
to
i
replied
emphatically
that
i
did
not
think
so
that
could
never
be
made
by
any
means
and
that
the
commencement
of
a
course
of
even
disinterested
kindness
on
such
principles
would
be
sure
to
end
vell
then
i
reconsider
my
decision
as
the
maginstrates
ought
to
say
but
never
do
that
right
and
now
we
must
part
slidder
i
said
stopping
here
is
the
second
sixpence
i
promised
you
also
my
card
and
address
will
you
come
and
see
me
at
my
own
house
the
day
after
at
eight
in
the
morning
i
will
replied
the
boy
with
decision
but
i
say
all
fair
no
nor
nuffin
o
that
sort
hey
honour
bright
honour
bright
i
replied
holding
out
my
hand
which
he
grasped
and
shook
quite
heartily
we
had
both
taken
two
or
three
steps
in
opposite
directions
when
as
if
under
the
same
impulse
we
looked
back
at
each
other
and
in
so
doing
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
dumps
stood
between
us
on
the
pavement
in
a
state
of
extreme
indecision
or
mental
confusion
hallo
i
say
we
bin
an
forgot
punch
exclaimed
the
boy
dumps
said
i
come
along
punch
said
he
come
here
good
dog
my
doggie
looked
first
at
one
then
at
the
other
the
two
indicators
in
front
rose
and
fell
while
the
one
behind
wagged
and
drooped
in
a
state
of
obvious
uncertainty
wo
you
sell
back
said
slidder
returning
i
work
it
out
in
messages
or
anythink
else
but
what
of
the
bobbies
i
asked
ah
true
i
forgot
the
bobbies
i
be
able
to
keep
for
a
week
not
so
long
afore
they
nab
go
punch
go
you
do
know
ven
you
vell
off
the
tone
in
which
this
was
uttered
settled
the
point
and
turned
the
wavering
balance
of
the
creature
affections
in
my
favour
with
all
the
indicators
extremely
pendulous
and
its
hairy
coat
hanging
in
a
species
of
limp
humility
my
doggie
followed
me
home
but
i
observed
that
as
we
went
along
he
ever
and
anon
turned
a
wistful
glance
in
the
direction
in
which
the
ragged
waif
had
disappeared
chapter
four
in
which
dumps
finds
another
old
friend
one
morning
a
considerable
time
after
the
events
narrated
in
the
last
chapter
i
sat
on
the
sofa
waiting
for
breakfast
and
engaged
in
an
interesting
conversation
with
dumps
the
only
difference
in
our
mode
of
communication
was
that
dumps
talked
with
his
eyes
i
with
my
tongue
from
what
i
have
already
said
about
my
doggie
it
will
be
understood
that
his
eyes
which
were
brown
and
speaking
eyes
lay
behind
such
a
forest
of
hair
that
it
was
only
by
clearing
the
dense
masses
away
that
i
could
obtain
a
full
view
of
his
liquid
orbs
i
am
not
sure
that
his
ears
were
much
less
expressive
than
his
eyes
their
variety
of
motion
coupled
with
their
rate
of
action
served
greatly
to
develop
the
full
meaning
of
what
his
eyes
said
mrs
miff
seems
to
have
forgotten
us
this
morning
dumps
i
remarked
pulling
out
my
watch
one
ear
cocked
forward
the
other
turned
back
towards
the
door
and
a
white
gleam
under
the
hair
indicating
that
the
eyes
turned
in
the
same
direction
said
as
plainly
as
there
was
any
occasion
for
no
not
quite
forgotten
us
i
hear
her
coming
now
ha
so
she
is
now
you
shall
have
a
feed
both
ears
elevated
to
the
full
extent
obviously
meant
hurrah
while
a
certain
motion
of
his
body
appeared
to
imply
that
in
consequence
of
his
sedentary
position
he
was
vainly
attempting
to
wag
the
sofa
if
you
please
sir
said
my
landlady
laying
the
breakfast
tray
on
the
table
there
a
in
the
kitchen
says
he
wants
to
see
you
ah
young
slidder
i
fancy
well
send
him
up

says
he

breakfast

will
wait
till
you
have
done
sir
very
considerate
send
him
up
nevertheless
in
a
few
minutes
my
stood
before
me
hat
in
hand
looking
in
the
trim
costume
of
the
brigade
quite
a
different
being
from
the
ragged
creature
i
had
met
with
in
whitechapel
dumps
instantly
assaulted
him
with
loving
demonstrations
how
spruce
you
look
my
boy
thanks
to
sir
replied
slidder
with
a
familiar
nod
they
do
say
i

hope

like
the
work
have
you
had
breakfast
would
a
roll
do

good
thankee
i
primed
for
the
day
i
came
over
sir
to
say
that
granny
seems
to
me
to
be
out
o
sorts
since
i
been
allowed
to
sleep
on
the
rug
inside
her
door
i
noticed
that
she
ai
so
lively
as
she
used
to
was
shivers
a
deal
it
ai
cold
groans
now
an
then
an

returned
slidder
she
ai
wery
bad
not

than
i
bin
too
anxious
about
her
poor
old
thing
i
vait
below
till
you
come
along
punch
an
jine
yer
old
pal
in
the
kitchen
till
the
noo
ready
after
breakfast
we
three
hurried
out
and
wended
our
way
eastward
as
the
morning
was
unusually
fine
i
diverged
towards
one
of
the
more
fashionable
localities
to
deliver
a
note
with
which
i
had
been
charged
young
slidder
spirits
were
high
and
for
a
considerable
time
he
entertained
me
with
a
good
deal
of
the
gossip
among
other
things
he
told
me
of
the
great
work
that
was
being
done
there
by
dr
barnardo
and
others
of
similar
spirit
in
rescuing
waifs
like
himself
from
their
wretched
condition
though
some
on
us
do
think
it
so
wretched
arter
all
he
continued
there
the
slogger
now
he
wo
go
into
the
on
no
consideration
says
he
would
give
a
empty
for
all
the
in
london
but
then
the
slogger
a
lazy
muff
he
do
want
to
work
that
about
it
he
sooner
starve
than
work
by
consikence
he
steals
more
or
less
an
finds
a
in
the
jug
pretty
frequent
as
to
his
taste
for
a
i
ai
so
sure
that
i
do
agree
with
it
big
you
know
plenty
of
room
to
move
it
ai
so
with
a
an
then
the
smell
oh
you
no
notion
that
wuth
the
price
of
a
night
lodgin
itself
to
say
nothin
o
the
chance
of
a
or
a
crack
full
o
sugar
that
the
former
tenants
has
failed
to
diskiver
while
the
waif
was
commenting
thus
enthusiastically
on
the
bliss
of
lodging
in
a
we
were
surprised
to
see
dumps
who
chanced
to
be
trotting
on
in
front
come
to
a
sudden
pause
and
gaze
at
a
lady
who
was
in
the
act
of
ringing
the
of
an
adjoining
house
the
door
was
opened
by
a
footman
and
the
lady
was
in
the
act
of
entering
when
dumps
gave
vent
to
a
series
of
sounds
made
up
of
a
whine
a
bark
and
a
yelp
at
the
same
moment
his
tail
all
but
twirled
him
off
his
legs
as
he
rushed
wildly
up
the
stairs
and
began
to
dance
round
the
lady
in
mad
excitement
the
lady
backed
against
the
door
in
alarm
the
footman
anxious
apparently
about
his
calves
seized
an
umbrella
and
made
a
wild
assault
on
the
dog
and
i
was
confusedly
conscious
of
slidder
exclaiming
why
if
that
ai
young
lady
as
i
sprang
up
the
steps
to
the
rescue
down
dumps
you
rascal
down
i
exclaimed
seizing
him
by
the
brass
collar
with
which
i
had
invested
pardon
the
rudeness
of
my
dog
madam
i
said
looking
up
i
never
saw
him
act
in
this
way
before
it
is
quite
unaccountable
not
quite
so
unaccountable
as
you
think
interrupted
slidder
who
stood
looking
calmly
on
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
grin
on
his
it
your
own
dog
miss
what
do
you
mean
boy
said
the
lady
a
gaze
of
surprise
chasing
away
the
look
of
alarm
which
had
covered
her
pretty
face
i
mean
what
i
says
miss
the
dog
your
own
i
sold
it
to
you
long
ago
for
five
bob
the
girl
for
she
was
little
more
than
sixteen
turned
with
a
startled
doubting
look
to
the
dog
if
you
do
it
miss
look
at
the
vite
spot
on
the
bridge
of
nose
said
slidder
with
a
nod
to
the
lady
and
a
supremely
insolent
wink
to
the
footman
pompey
exclaimed
the
girl
holding
out
a
pair
of
the
prettiest
little
gloved
hands
imaginable
my
doggie
broke
from
my
grasp
with
a
shriek
of
joy
and
sprang
into
her
arms
she
buried
her
face
in
his
shaggy
neck
and
absolutely
hugged
him
i
stood
aghast
the
footman
smiled
in
an
imbecile
manner
you
better
not
squeeze
quite
so
hard
miss
or
he
bust
remarked
the
waif
recovering
herself
and
dropping
the
dog
somewhat
hurriedly
she
turned
to
me
with
a
flushed
face
and
said
excuse
me
sir
this
unexpected
meeting
with
my
dog
dog
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
while
a
sense
of
unmerited
loss
began
to
creep
over
me
well
the
dog
was
mine
once
at
all
events
though
i
doubt
not
it
is
rightfully
yours
now
said
the
young
lady
with
a
smile
that
at
once
disarmed
me
it
was
stolen
from
me
a
few
months
after
i
had
bought
it
from
this
boy
who
seems
strangely
altered
since
then
i
glad
however
to
see
that
the
short
time
i
had
the
dog
was
sufficient
to
prevent
its
forgetting
me
but
perhaps
she
added
in
a
sad
tone
it
would
have
been
better
if
it
forgotten
me
my
mind
was
made
up
no
madam
said
i
with
decision
it
is
well
that
the
dog
has
not
forgotten
you
i
would
have
been
surprised
indeed
if
it
had
it
is
yours
i
could
not
think
of
robbing
you
of
it
i
i
am
going
to
visit
a
sick
woman
and
can
not
delay
forgive
me
if
i
ask
permission
to
leave
the
dog
with
you
until
i
return
in
the
afternoon
to
hand
it
formally
over
and
bid
it
farewell
this
was
said
half
in
jest
yet
i
felt
very
much
in
earnest
for
the
thought
of
parting
from
my
doggie
even
to
such
a
fair
mistress
cost
me
no
small
amount
of
pain
much
to
my
surprise
for
i
had
not
imagined
it
possible
that
i
could
have
formed
so
strong
an
attachment
to
a
dumb
animal
in
so
short
a
time
but
you
see
being
a
bachelor
of
an
unsocial
spirit
my
doggie
and
i
had
been
thrown
much
together
in
the
evenings
and
had
made
the
most
of
our
time
the
young
lady
half
laughed
and
hesitatingly
thanked
me
as
she
went
into
the
house
followed
by
dumps
punch
pompey
who
never
so
much
as
cast
one
parting
glance
on
me
as
i
turned
to
leave
a
shout
caused
me
to
turn
again
and
look
back
i
beheld
an
infant
rolling
down
the
stairs
like
a
small
alpine
boulder
a
little
girl
was
vainly
attempting
to
arrest
the
infant
and
three
boys
of
various
sizes
came
bounding
towards
the
young
lady
with
shouts
of
welcome
in
the
midst
of
the
din
my
doggie
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
the
babel
of
children
voices
was
hushed
by
a
bass
growl
and
the
street
door
closed
with
a
bang
yell
that
a
rum
go
exclaimed
my
little
companion
as
we
walked
slowly
away
do
it
seem
to
you
now
as
if
it
wor
all
a
dream
it
does
indeed
i
replied
half
inclined
to
laugh
yet
with
a
feeling
of
sadness
at
my
heart
for
i
knew
that
my
doggie
and
i
were
parted
for
ever
even
if
the
young
lady
should
insist
on
my
keeping
the
dog
i
felt
that
i
could
not
agree
to
do
so
no
i
had
committed
myself
and
the
thing
was
done
for
it
was
clear
that
with
the
mutual
affection
existing
between
the
lady
and
the
dog
they
would
not
willingly
consent
to
be
parted
it
would
be
cruelty
even
to
suggest
a
separation
pshaw
thought
i
why
should
the
loss
of
a
miserable
dog
a
mere
mass
of
shapeless
hair
affect
me
so
much
pooh
i
will
brush
the
subject
away
so
i
brushed
it
away
but
back
it
came
again
in
spite
of
all
my
brushing
and
insisted
on
remaining
to
trouble
me
short
though
our
friendship
had
been
it
had
i
found
become
very
warm
and
strong
i
recalled
a
good
many
pleasant
evenings
when
seated
alone
in
my
room
with
a
favourite
author
i
had
read
and
tickled
dumps
under
the
chin
and
behind
the
ears
to
such
an
extent
that
i
had
thoroughly
gained
his
heart
and
as
love
begets
love
i
had
been
drawn
insensibly
yet
powerfully
towards
him
in
short
dumps
and
i
understood
each
other
while
i
was
meditating
on
these
things
my
companion
who
had
walked
along
in
silence
suddenly
said
you
need
take
on
so
sir
about
punch
how
know
i
taking
on
so
you
look
so
awful
solemncholy
an
there
no
occasion
to
do
so
you
can
get
the
critter
back
again
i
fear
not
slidder
for
i
have
already
given
it
to
the
young
lady
and
you
have
seen
how
fond
she
is
of
it
and
the
dog
evidently
likes
her
better
than
it
likes
me
yell
i
ai
surprised
at
it
proves
it
to
be
a
dog
of
good
taste
but
you
can
get
it
back
for
all
that
how
so
i
asked
much
amused
by
the
decision
and
of
the
boy
manner
vy
you
got
to
go
and
marry
the
young
lady
of
course
all
her
property
becomes
yours
punch
included
do
you
see
true
slidder
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
in
that
light
said
i
laughing
heartily
as
much
at
the
cool
and
quiet
insolence
of
the
manner
as
at
his
suggestion
but
then
you
see
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
young
ladies
who
dwell
in
fine
mansions
are
not
fond
of
marrying
penniless
doctors
pooh
replied
the
urchin
that
nuffin
to
do
with
it
got
to
set
up
in
a
close
alongside
with
a
big
gold
mortar
over
the
door
an
a
broom
an
you
in
six
months
or
eight
if
she
got
contrairy
parents
then
you
want
a
tiger
of
course
to
the
an
i
knows
a
smart
young
feller
whose
name
begins
with
a
s
as
would
just
suit
so
you
see
you
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
in
an
win
the
precocious
waif
looked
up
in
my
face
with
such
an
expression
of
satisfaction
as
he
finished
this
audacious
speech
that
i
could
not
help
gazing
at
him
in
blank
amazement
what
i
should
have
replied
i
know
not
for
we
arrived
just
then
at
the
abode
of
old
mrs
willis
the
poor
old
lady
was
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
influenza
which
coupled
with
age
and
the
depression
caused
by
her
heavy
sorrow
had
reduced
her
physical
powers
in
an
alarming
degree
it
was
obvious
that
she
urgently
required
good
food
and
careful
nursing
i
never
before
felt
so
keenly
my
lack
of
money
my
means
barely
sufficed
to
keep
myself
educational
expenses
being
heavy
i
was
a
shy
man
too
and
had
never
made
friends
at
least
among
the
rich
to
whom
i
could
apply
on
occasions
like
this
dear
granny
i
said
you
would
get
along
nicely
if
you
would
consent
to
go
to
a
hospital
never
said
the
old
lady
in
a
tone
of
decision
that
surprised
me
i
assure
you
granny
that
you
would
be
much
better
cared
for
and
fed
there
than
you
can
be
here
and
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
give
up
your
room
i
would
look
after
it
until
you
are
better
still
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
which
was
shaking
badly
enough
from
age
as
it
was
going
to
the
corner
cupboard
in
which
mrs
willis
kept
her
little
store
of
food
and
physic
i
stood
there
pondering
what
i
should
do
please
sir
said
slidder
sidling
up
to
me
if
you
wants
or
steaks
or
port
wine
or
anythink
o
that
sort
just
say
the
word
and
i
get
you
boy
how
vy

the
shops
full
of
i
go
an
help
myself
spite
of
all
the
bobbies
that
valks
in
blue
oh
slidder
said
i
really
grieved
for
i
saw
by
his
earnest
face
that
he
meant
it
would
you
go
and
steal
after
all
i
have
said
to
you
about
that
sin
vell
sir
i
would
prig
for
myself
indeed
i
would
but
i
do
it
to
make
the
old
better
that
would
not
change
stealing
into
a
virtue
no
my
boy
we
must
try
to
hit
on
some
other
way
of
providing
for
her
wants
the
lord
will
provide
said
mrs
willis
from
the
bed
she
had
overheard
us
i
hastened
to
her
side
yes
granny

meanwhile
he
has
given
me
enough
money
to
spare

little
for
your
immediate
wants

things
which
your
kind
neighbour
mrs
jones
will
cook
for
you

pass
her
door

go
home
with
me
and

medicines

require
now
try
to
sleep
till
mrs
jones
comes
with
the
food
you
must
not
speak
to
me
it
will
make
you
worse
i
only
want
to
ask
john

any
any
news
about

not
yet
granny
but
do
be
cast
down
if

you
can
trust
him
for
protection
not
only
to
yourself
but
to
edie
remember
the
words
thy
way
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
bring
it
to
pass
thank
you
john
replied
the
old
woman
as
she
sank
back
on
her
pillow
with
a
little
sigh
after
leaving
mrs
willis
i
was
detained
so
long
with
some
of
my
patients
that
it
was
late
before
i
could
turn
my
steps
westward
the
night
was
very
cold
with
a
keen
december
wind
blowing
and
heavy
black
clouds
driving
across
the
dark
sky
it
was
after
midnight
as
i
drew
near
the
neighbourhood
of
the
house
in
which
i
had
left
dumps
so
hurriedly
that
morning
in
my
haste
i
had
neglected
to
ask
the
name
of
the
young
lady
with
whom
i
had
left
him
or
to
note
the
number
of
the
house
but
i
recollected
its
position
and
resolved
to
go
round
by
it
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
name
on
the
door
chapter
five
conspiracy
and
villainy
innocence
and
tragedy
in
one
of
the
dirtiest
of
the
dirty
and
disreputable
dens
of
london
a
man
and
a
boy
sat
on
that
same
dark
december
night
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
their
seats
were
stools
their
table
was
an
empty
their
apartment
a
cellar
a
farthing
candle
stood
awry
in
the
neck
of
a
pint
bottle
a
jug
of
hot
and
two
cracked
stood
between
them
the
damp
of
the
place
was
drawn
out
rather
than
abated
by
a
small
fire
which
burned
in
a
rusty
grate
over
which
they
sought
to
warm
their
hands
as
they
conversed
the
man
was
palpably
a
scoundrel
not
less
so
was
the
boy
slogger
said
the
man
in
a
growling
voice
we
must
do
it
this
wery
night
vell
brassey
i
game
replied
the
slogger
draining
his
cup
with
a
defiant
air
if
it
had
bin
for
that
old
as
was
all
last
summer
continued
the
man
as
he
pricked
a
refractory
we
found
the
job
more
difficult
but
you
see
she
went
and
lost
the
key
o
the
back
door
and
the
doctor
he
to
get
another
so
i
goes
an
gets
round
the
old
an
pumps
her
about
the
lost
key
an
at
last
i
finds
it
d
see
but
returned
the
slogger
with
a
knowing
frown
seems
to
me
as
how
you
never
get
two
keys
into
one
lock
eh
the
noo
would
let
the
old
in
would
it
ah
that
where
it
is
replied
mr
brassey
with
a
leer
as
he
raised
his
cup
to
his
large
ugly
mouth
and
chuckled
you
see
the
wife
she
summat
timmersome
an
looks
arter
the
lockin
up
every
night
herself
wery
partikler
then
she
all
the
keys
up
into
her
own
bedroom
o
nights
so
you
see
in
consikence
of
her
uncommon
care
she
keeps
all
the
locks
clear
for
you
and
me
to
work
upon
the
slogger
was
so
overcome
by
this
instance
of
the
result
of
excessive
caution
that
he
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes
and
had
to
apply
for
relief
to
the
hot
ever
did
you
come
for
to
find
that
hout
asked
the
boy
servants
replied
the
man
ha
exclaimed
the
boy
with
a
wink
which
would
have
been
knowing
if
the
spirits
had
not
by
that
time
rendered
it
ridiculous
yes
you
see
continued
the
elder
ruffian
blowing
a
heavy
cloud
of
smoke
like
a
cannon
shot
from
his
lips
servants
is
wariable
in
character
some
is
good
an
some
is
bad
i
mostly
take
up
wi
the
bad
there
one
in
the
doctor
as
is
a
prime
favourite
with
me
an
knows
all
about
the
locks
she
does
but
there
a
noo
unexpected
difficulty
sprung
up
in
the
way
this
wery
mornin
wot
that
demanded
the
slogger
with
the
air
of
a
man
prepared
to
defy
all
difficulties
they
bin
an
got
a
dog
a
little
dog
too
the
very
wust
kind
for
kickin
up
a
row
it
ai
the
fust
time

met
an
conkered
such
a
difficulty
you
take
a
bit
of
cat
meat
in
your
pocket
you
know
hall
right
exclaimed
the
young
housebreaker
with
a
reckless
toss
of
his
shaggy
head
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
jug
but
the
elder
scoundrel
laid
his
stronger
hand
upon
it
come
slogger
no
more
o
that
you
too
much
already
you
wo
be
fit
for
dooty
if
you
take
more
it
wery
on
a
cove
growled
the
lad
sulkily
brassey
looked
narrowly
into
his
face
then
took
up
the
forbidden
jug
and
himself
drained
it
after
which
he
rose
grasped
the
boy
by
his
collar
and
forced
him
struggling
towards
a
sink
full
of
dirty
water
into
which
he
thrust
his
head
and
shook
it
about
roughly
for
a
second
or
two
there
that
sober
you
said
the
man
releasing
the
boy
and
sending
him
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
kick
now
do
let
your
monkey
rise
slogger
it
all
for
your
good
i
be
back
in
an
hour
see
that
you
have
the
tools
ready
so
saying
the
man
left
the
cellar
and
the
boy
who
was
much
exasperated
though
decidedly
sobered
by
his
treatment
proceeded
to
dry
himself
with
a
and
make
preparations
for
the
intended
burglary
the
house
in
regard
to
which
such
interesting
preparations
were
being
made
was
buried
at
the
hour
i
write
of
in
profound
repose
as
its
fate
and
its
family
have
something
to
do
with
my
tale
i
shall
describe
it
somewhat
particularly
in
the
basement
there
was
an
offshoot
or
scullery
which
communicated
with
the
kitchen
this
scullery
had
been
set
apart
that
day
as
the
bedroom
of
my
little
dog
of
course
i
knew
nothing
of
this
and
what
i
am
about
to
relate
at
that
time
i
learned
it
all
afterwards
dumps
lay
sound
asleep
on
a
flannel
bed
made
by
loving
hands
in
the
bottom
of
a
it
lay
under
the
shadow
of
a
the
servants
beer
a
fresh
cask
which
having
arrived
late
that
evening
had
not
been
relegated
to
the
cellar
the
only
other
individual
who
slept
on
the
basement
was
the
footman
that
worthy
being
elderly
and
feeble
though
bold
as
a
lion
had
been
doomed
to
the
lower
regions
by
his
mistress
as
a
sure
protection
against
burglars
he
went
to
bed
nightly
with
a
poker
and
a
pistol
so
disposed
that
he
could
clutch
them
both
while
in
the
act
of
springing
from
bed
this
arrangement
was
made
not
to
relieve
his
own
fears
but
by
order
of
his
mistress
with
whom
he
could
hold
communication
at
night
without
rising
by
means
of
a
john
he
chanced
to
bear
my
own
name
had
been
so
long
subject
to
night
alarms
partly
from
cats
careering
in
the
back
yard
and
his
mistress
demanding
to
know
through
the
tube
if
he
heard
them
partly
also
from
frequent
ringing
of
the
by
persons
who
urgently
wanted
dr
mctougall
that
he
had
become
callous
in
his
nervous
system
and
did
much
of
his
as
a
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
above
consisting
of
the
library
and
etcetera
were
left
as
usual
tenantless
and
dark
at
night
on
the
floor
mrs
mctougall
lay
in
her
comfortable
bed
sound
asleep
and
dreamless
the
poor
lady
had
spent
the
first
part
of
that
night
in
considerable
fear
because
of
the
restlessness
of
dumps
in
his
new
and
strange
bedroom
her
husband
being
absent
because
of
a
sudden
call
to
a
country
patient
the
had
been
pretty
well
worked
and
john
had
been
lively
in
consequence
though
patient
but
at
last
the
drowsy
god
had
calmed
the
good
lady
into
a
state
of
oblivion
on
the
floor
above
besides
various
bedrooms
there
were
the
night
nursery
and
the
schoolroom
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
slumbered
the
young
lady
who
had
robbed
me
of
my
doggie
in
the
nursery
were
four
cribs
and
a
cradle
dr
mctougall
family
had
come
in
what
i
may
style
annual
progression
six
years
had
he
been
married
and
each
year
had
contributed
another
annual
to
the
army
the
children
were
now
ranged
round
the
walls
with
mathematical
precision
one
two
three
four
and
five
the
doctor
liked
them
all
to
be
together
and
the
nursery
being
unusually
large
permitted
of
this
arrangement
a
tall
powerful
woman
of
uncertain
age
officered
the
army
by
day
and
guarded
it
by
night
jack
and
harry
and
job
and
jenny
occupied
the
cribs
dolly
the
cradle
each
of
these
creatures
had
been
transfixed
by
sleep
in
the
very
midst
of
some
desperate
enterprise
during
the
earlier
watches
of
that
night
and
all
had
fallen
down
in
more
or
less
and
reckless
attitudes
here
a
fat
fist
doubled
there
a
fatter
leg
protruded
elsewhere
a
spread
eagle
was
represented
with
the
bedclothes
in
a
heap
on
its
stomach
or
a
complex
knot
was
displayed
made
up
of
legs
sheets
blankets
and
arms
subsequently
the
tall
but
faithful
guardian
had
gone
round
disentangled
the
knot
reduced
the
spread
eagle
and
straightened
them
all
out
they
now
lay
stiff
and
motionless
as
mummies
roseate
as
the
morn
deceptively
innocent
with
eyes
tight
shut
and
mouths
wide
open
save
in
the
case
of
dolly
whose
natural
appetite
could
only
be
appeased
by
the
nightly
sucking
of
two
of
her
own
fingers
in
the
attics
three
domestics
slumbered
in
peace
still
higher
a
belated
cat
reposed
in
the
lee
of
a
it
was
a
restful
scene
which
none
but
a
heartless
monster
could
have
ventured
to
disturb
even
brassey
and
the
slogger
had
no
intention
of
disturbing
it
on
the
contrary
it
was
their
earnest
hope
that
they
might
accomplish
their
designs
on
the
doctor
plate
with
as
little
disturbance
as
possible
their
motto
was
a
paraphrase
get
the
plate
quietly
if
you
can
but
get
the
plate
in
the
midst
of
the
universal
stillness
when
no
sound
was
heard
save
the
sighing
of
the
or
the
solemn
creaking
of
an
unsuccessful
there
came
a
voice
of
alarm
down
the
tube
john
do
you
hear
burglars
oh
dear
no
mum
i
do
i
convinced
i
hear
them
at
the
back
of
the
house
tubed
mrs
mctougall
indeed
it
ai
mum
tubed
john
in
reply
it
that
little
dog
as
comed
this
morning
and
ai
got
used
to
its
noo
yet
mum
that
wot
it
is
oh
do
get
up
john
and
put
a
light
beside
him
perhaps
he
afraid
of
the
dark
very
well
mum
said
john
obedient
but
savage
he
arose
upset
the
poker
and
pistol
with
a
hideous
clatter
which
was
luckily
too
remote
to
smite
horror
into
the
heart
of
mrs
mctougall
and
groped
his
way
into
the
servants
hall
lighting
a
paraffin
lamp
he
went
to
the
scullery
using
very
unfair
and
harsh
language
towards
my
innocent
dog
pompey
you
brute
the
footman
had
already
learned
his
name
hold
your
noise
there
he
set
the
lamp
on
the
head
of
the
beer
cask
and
returned
to
bed
it
is
believed
that
poor
perplexed
dumps
viewed
the
midnight
apparition
with
silent
surprise
and
wagged
his
tail
being
friendly
then
gazed
at
the
lamp
after
the
apparition
had
retired
until
obliged
to
give
the
subject
up
like
a
difficult
conundrum
and
finally
went
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
of
dogs
or
me
it
was
while
dumps
was
thus
engaged
that
brassey
and
the
slogger
walked
up
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
surveyed
it
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
they
also
took
particular
observations
of
both
ends
of
the
street
all
serene
said
brassey
now
you
go
round
to
the
back
and
use
your
key
quietly
give
the
bit
o
meat
quick
he
wo
give
tongue
arter
smells
it
and
one
or
two
barks
wo
alarm
the
so
get
along
slogger
you
got
him
snug
with
a
rope
round
neck
an
head
in
the
flannel
bag
just
caterwaul
an
i
come
round
bless
the
cats
they
a
great
help
to
gentlemen
in
our
procession
thus
admonished
the
slogger
chuckled
and
melted
into
the
darkness
while
brassey
mingled
himself
with
the
shadow
of
a
pillar
the
key
lost
by
the
and
found
by
the
burglar
fitted
into
the
empty
lock
even
more
perfectly
than
that
which
mrs
mctougall
had
conveyed
to
her
mantelpiece
some
hours
before
it
was
well
oiled
too
and
went
round
in
the
wards
of
the
lock
without
giving
a
chirp
so
that
the
bolt
flew
back
with
one
solitary
shot
the
report
however
was
loud
it
caused
dumps
to
return
from
dogland
and
raise
his
head
with
a
decided
growl
nobody
heard
the
growl
except
the
slogger
who
stood
perfectly
still
for
nearly
a
minute
with
his
hand
on
the
then
he
opened
the
door
slowly
and
softly
so
slowly
and
softly
that
an
attached
to
it
did
not
ring
a
sharp
bow
wow
wow
however
greeted
him
as
he
entered
but
he
was
prompt
a
small
piece
of
meat
fell
directly
under
the
nose
of
dumps
as
he
stood
bristling
in
front
of
his
box
and
let
me
add
when
dumps
bristled
it
was
a
sight
to
behold
good
dog
good
said
the
slogger
in
his
softest
and
most
insinuating
tone
dumps
reduced
his
bark
to
a
growl
the
footman
heard
both
bark
and
growl
but
attributing
them
to
the
influence
of
cats
turned
on
his
other
side
and
listened
not
for
burglars
innocent
man
but
for
the
tube
it
was
silent
evidently
tired
nature
was
in
mrs
mctougall
case
lulled
by
the
sweet
restorer
forthwith
john
betook
himself
again
to
the
land
of
nod
have
another
bit
said
the
slogger
in
quite
a
friendly
way
after
the
first
bit
had
been
devoured
my
too
trusting
favourite
wagged
his
tail
and
innocently
accepted
the
bribe
it
was
good
cat
meat
dumps
liked
it
the
enormous
supper
with
which
he
had
lain
down
was
by
that
time
nearly
assimilated
and
appetite
had
begun
to
revive
going
down
on
his
knee
the
young
burglar
held
out
a
third
morsel
of
temptation
in
his
hand
dumps
meekly
advanced
and
took
the
meat
it
was
a
sad
illustration
of
the
ease
with
which
even
a
dog
descends
from
bad
to
worse
while
he
was
engaged
with
it
the
slogger
gently
patted
his
head
suddenly
dumps
found
his
muzzle
grasped
and
held
tight
in
a
powerful
hand
he
tried
to
bark
and
yell
but
could
produce
nothing
better
than
a
scarcely
audible
whine
his
sides
were
at
the
same
instant
grasped
by
a
pair
of
powerful
knees
while
a
rope
was
twisted
round
his
neck
and
the
process
of
strangulation
began
but
strangulation
was
not
the
slogger
intention
he
had
been
carefully
warned
not
to
kill
mind
now
you
do
screw
up
too
tight
brassey
had
said
when
giving
the
boy
his
instructions
before
starting
dogs
is
vurth
munny
just
tight
and
quiet
till
you
get
the
flannel
bag
on
head
and
then
stand
by
till
i
sacked
the
swag
accordingly
having
effected
the
bagging
of
the
dog
head
the
young
burglar
went
to
the
door
holding
dumps
tight
in
his
arms
and
uttered
a
pretty
loud
and
caterwaul
brassey
heard
it
emerged
from
the
shade
of
his
pillar
and
was
soon
beside
his
comrade
when
dumps
smelt
and
heard
the
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
free
his
head
and
yell
but
the
slogger
was
too
much
for
him
few
words
were
wasted
on
this
occasion
the
couple
understood
their
work
brassey
took
up
the
lamp
wery
considerate
of
to
a
light
all
ready
for
us
he
muttered
as
he
lowered
the
flame
a
little
and
glided
into
the
kitchen
leaving
the
slogger
on
guard
in
the
scullery
here
he
found
a
variety
of
gins
and
snares
carefully
placed
for
him
and
such
as
he
by
strict
orders
of
mrs
mctougall
besides
a
on
the
window
shutter
similar
to
that
which
had
done
so
little
service
on
the
scullery
door
there
was
a
with
the
kitchen
tongs
balanced
against
it
and
a
tin
in
company
with
the
kitchen
shovel
and
a
which
the
poker
being
already
engaged
to
john
was
balanced
on
its
own
rose
and
handle
all
ready
to
fail
with
a
touch
these
outworks
being
echelloned
along
the
floor
rendered
it
impossible
for
an
intruder
to
cross
the
kitchen
in
the
dark
without
overturning
one
or
more
of
them
thanks
to
the
lamp
brassey
steered
his
way
carefully
and
with
a
grim
smile
at
john
waters
door
he
paused
and
listened
john
nose
revealed
his
condition
gliding
up
the
stairs
on
shoeless
feet
the
burglar
entered
the
picked
the
locks
of
the
sideboard
with
marvellous
celerity
unfolded
a
canvas
bag
and
placed
therein
whatever
valuables
he
could
lay
hands
on
proceeding
next
to
the
floor
he
began
to
examine
and
appropriate
the
articles
of
that
appeared
to
him
most
valuable
not
being
a
perfect
judge
of
such
matters
mr
brassey
was
naturally
puzzled
with
some
of
them
one
in
particular
caused
him
to
regard
it
with
frowning
attention
for
nearly
a
minute
before
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
vurth
munny
he
placed
the
lamp
on
the
small
table
near
the
window
from
which
he
had
lifted
the
ornament
in
question
and
sat
down
on
a
crimson
chair
with
gilded
legs
to
examine
it
more
critically
meanwhile
the
slogger
left
in
the
dark
with
the
still
fitfully
struggling
dumps
employed
his
leisure
in
running
over
some
of
the
salient
events
of
his
past
career
and
in
trying
to
ascertain
by
the
very
faint
light
that
came
from
a
distant
what
was
the
nature
of
his
immediate
surroundings
his
nose
told
him
that
the
cask
at
his
elbow
was
beer
his
exploring
right
hand
told
him
that
the
tap
was
in
it
his
native
intelligence
suggested
a
tumbler
on
the
head
of
the
cask
and
the
exploring
hand
proved
the
idea
to
be
correct
brassey
was
wery
on
me
he
thought
i
like
to
have
a
swig
but
dumps
was
sadly
in
the
way
to
remove
his
left
hand
even
for
an
instant
from
the
dog
muzzle
was
not
to
be
thought
of
in
this
dilemma
he
resolved
to
tie
up
the
said
muzzle
and
the
legs
also
even
at
the
risk
of
causing
death
it
would
not
take
more
than
a
minute
to
draw
a
tumblerful
and
any
dog
worth
a
straw
could
hold
his
wind
for
a
minute
he
would
try
he
did
try
and
was
yet
in
the
act
of
drawing
the
beer
when
my
doggie
burst
his
bonds
by
a
frantic
effort
to
be
free
probably
the
hairy
nature
of
his
little
body
had
rendered
a
firm
bond
impossible
at
all
events
he
suddenly
found
his
legs
loose
another
effort
more
frantic
than
before
set
free
the
muzzle
and
then
there
arose
on
the
still
night
air
a
yell
so
shrill
so
loud
so
indescribably
horrible
that
its
conception
must
be
left
entirely
to
the
reader
imagination
at
the
same
instant
dumps
scurried
into
the
kitchen
the
scuttle
and
tongs
went
down
the
and
shovel
followed
suit
also
the
into
which
latter
dumps
went
head
foremost
as
it
fell
and
from
its
interior
another
yell
issued
with
such
resonant
power
that
the
first
yell
was
a
mere
chirp
by
contrast
the
slogger
fled
from
the
scene
like
an
evil
spirit
while
john
waters
sprang
up
and
grasped
the
pistol
and
poker
the
effect
on
brassey
in
the
can
not
be
conceived
much
less
described
he
shot
as
it
were
out
of
the
chair
and
overturned
the
lamp
which
burst
on
the
floor
being
half
full
of
paraffin
oil
it
instantly
set
fire
to
the
gauze
the
burglar
made
straight
for
the
stairs
john
waters
observing
the
light
dashed
up
the
same
and
the
two
met
face
to
face
on
the
landing
breathing
hate
and
glaring
defiance
chapter
six
relates
a
stirring
innocent
now
it
was
at
this
critical
moment
that
i
chanced
to
come
upon
the
scene
i
had
just
ascertained
from
the
brass
plate
on
the
door
that
dr
mctougall
dwelt
there
and
was
thinking
what
an
ugly
unromantic
name
that
was
for
a
pretty
girl
as
i
descended
the
steps
when
dumps
first
yell
broke
upon
my
astonished
ears
i
recognised
the
voice
at
once
though
i
must
confess
that
the
second
yell
from
the
interior
of
the
perplexed
me
not
a
little
but
the
hideous
clatter
with
which
it
was
associated
and
the
sudden
bursting
out
of
flames
in
the
drove
all
thoughts
of
dumps
instantly
away
my
first
impulse
was
to
rush
to
the
nearest
but
a
wild
shouting
in
the
lobby
of
the
house
arrested
me
i
rang
the
bell
violently
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
the
report
of
a
pistol
and
a
savage
curse
as
a
bullet
came
crashing
through
the
door
and
went
close
past
my
head
then
i
heard
a
blow
followed
by
a
groan
this
was
succeeded
by
female
shrieks
overhead
and
the
violent
undoing
of
the
bolts
locks
and
chains
of
the
front
door
thought
is
quick
burglary
flashed
into
my
mind
a
fellow
leaped
out
as
the
door
flew
open
i
recognised
him
instantly
as
the
man
who
had
sold
dumps
to
me
i
put
my
foot
in
front
of
him
he
went
over
it
with
a
wild
pitch
and
descended
the
steps
on
his
nose
i
was
about
to
leap
on
him
when
a
policeman
came
tearing
round
the
corner
just
in
time
to
receive
the
stunned
brassey
with
open
arms
as
he
rose
and
staggered
forward
just
so
do
give
way
too
much
to
your
feelings
i
take
care
of
you
my
poor
unfortunate
fellow
said
the
policeman
as
a
brother
in
blue
came
to
his
assistance
already
one
of
those
ubiquitous
creatures
a
had
flown
to
the
on
the
wings
of
hope
and
joy
and
an
engine
came
careering
round
the
corner
as
i
turned
to
rush
up
the
stairs
which
were
already
filled
with
smoke
i
dashed
in
the
first
door
i
came
to
a
lady
partially
clothed
stood
there
pale
as
death
and
motionless
quick
madam
descend
the
house
is
on
fire
i
gasped
in
sharp
sentences
as
i
seized
her
where
is
your
your
she
looked
young
i
cried
as
she
resisted
my
efforts
to
lead
her
out
i
no
sister
she
shrieked
your
daughter
then
quick
direct
me
oh
my
darling
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
where
i
shouted
in
desperation
for
the
smoke
was
thickening
she
screamed
and
rushed
out
intending
evidently
to
go
up
i
caught
her
round
the
waist
and
forced
her
down
the
stairs
thrust
her
into
the
arms
of
an
ascending
fireman
and
then
ran
up
again
taking
three
steps
at
a
time
the
cry
of
a
child
attracted
me
i
made
for
a
door
opposite
and
burst
it
open
the
scene
that
presented
itself
was
striking
out
of
four
cribs
and
a
cradle
arose
five
cones
of
with
a
pretty
little
curly
head
surmounting
each
cone
and
ten
eyes
blazing
with
amazement
a
tall
nurse
stood
erect
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
outstretched
arms
glaring
instantly
i
grasped
a
cone
in
each
arm
and
bore
it
from
the
room
blinded
with
smoke
i
ran
like
a
thunderbolt
into
the
arms
of
a
gigantic
fireman
take
it
easy
sir
you
do
far
more
work
if
you
keep
cool
straight
on
to
front
room
there
by
this
time
i
understood
and
darted
into
a
front
room
through
the
window
of
which
the
head
of
the
entered
at
the
same
moment
sending
glass
in
splinters
all
over
us
it
was
immediately
drawn
back
a
little
enabling
me
to
throw
up
the
and
thrust
the
two
children
into
the
arms
of
another
fireman
whose
head
suddenly
emerged
from
the
smoke
that
rose
from
the
windows
below
i
could
see
that
the
fire
was
roaring
out
into
the
street
and
lighting
up
hundreds
of
faces
below
while
the
steady
clank
of
engines
told
that
the
brigade
was
busily
at
work
fighting
the
flames
but
i
had
no
time
to
look
or
think
indeed
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
power
of
volition
properly
my
own
but
that
i
acted
under
the
strong
impulse
of
another
spirit
within
me
darting
back
towards
the
nursery
i
met
the
first
fireman
dragging
with
his
right
hand
the
tall
nurse
who
seemed
unreasonably
to
struggle
against
him
while
in
his
left
arm
he
carried
two
of
the
children
and
the
baby
by
its
in
his
teeth
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
had
emptied
the
nursery
and
turned
to
search
for
another
door
during
the
whole
of
this
scene
which
passed
in
a
few
minutes
a
feeling
of
desperate
anxiety
possessed
me
as
to
the
fate
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
i
had
given
up
my
doggie
i
felt
persuaded
she
slept
on
the
same
floor
with
the
children
and
groped
about
the
passage
in
search
of
another
door
by
this
time
the
smoke
was
so
dense
that
i
was
all
but
suffocated
a
minute
or
two
more
and
it
would
be
too
late
i
could
not
see
suddenly
i
felt
a
door
and
kicked
it
open
the
black
smoke
entered
with
me
but
it
was
still
clear
enough
inside
for
me
to
perceive
the
form
of
a
girl
lying
on
the
floor
it
was
she
miss
mctougall
i
shouted
endeavouring
to
rouse
her
but
she
had
fainted
not
a
moment
now
to
lose
a
lurid
tongue
of
flame
came
up
the
staircase
i
rolled
a
blanket
round
the
girl
head
and
all
she
was
very
light
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
raised
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
and
darted
back
towards
the
passage
but
the
few
moments
i
had
lost
almost
cost
us
our
lives
i
knew
that
to
breathe
the
dense
smoke
would
be
certain
suffocation
and
went
through
it
holding
my
breath
like
a
diver
i
felt
as
if
the
hot
flames
were
playing
round
my
head
and
smelt
the
singeing
of
my
own
hair
another
moment
and
i
had
reached
the
window
where
the
grim
but
welcome
head
of
the
escape
still
rested
with
a
desperate
bound
i
went
head
first
into
the
shoot
taking
my
precious
bundle
along
with
me
a
fireman
chanced
to
be
going
down
the
shoot
at
the
time
carefully
piloting
one
of
the
maids
who
had
been
rescued
from
the
attics
and
checking
his
speed
with
outspread
legs
against
him
i
canonned
with
tremendous
force
and
sent
him
and
his
charge
in
a
heap
to
the
bottom
this
was
fortunate
for
the
pace
at
which
i
must
have
otherwise
come
down
would
have
probably
broken
my
neck
as
it
was
i
felt
so
stunned
that
i
nearly
lost
consciousness
still
i
retained
my
senses
sufficiently
to
observe
a
stout
elderly
little
man
in
full
evening
dress
with
his
coat
slit
up
behind
to
his
neck
his
face
and
his
shaggy
hair
flying
wildly
in
all
directions
chiefly
upwards
amid
wild
cheering
from
the
crowd
i
confusedly
heard
the
conversation
that
followed
they
all
accounted
for
now
sir
said
a
policeman
who
supported
me
the
elderly
gentleman
had
leaped
forward
with
an
exclamation
of
earnest
thankfulness
and
unrolled
the
blanket
not
hurt
no
thank
god
lift
her
carefully
now
to
the
same
and
who
are
you
he
added
turning
and
looking
full
at
me
as
i
leaned
in
a
dazed
condition
on
the
fireman
shoulder
i
heard
the
question
and
saw
the
speaker
but
could
not
reply
this
is
the
as
saved
two
o
the
an
the
young
lady
said
the
tall
fireman
whom
i
recognised
as
the
one
into
whose
bosom
i
had
plunged
on
the
upper
floor
ay
an
he
the
said
another
fireman
who
shoved
your
missus
sir
into
my
arms
she
was
bent
on
runnin
is
this
so
said
the
little
gentleman
stepping
forward
and
grasping
my
hand
still
i
could
not
speak
i
felt
as
if
the
whole
affair
were
a
dream
and
looked
on
and
listened
with
a
vacant
smile
just
at
that
moment
a
long
melancholy
wail
rose
above
the
roaring
of
the
fire
and
clanking
of
the
engines
the
cry
restored
me
at
once
dumps
my
doggie
i
exclaimed
and
bursting
through
the
crowd
rushed
towards
the
now
house
but
strong
hands
restrained
me
what
dog
is
it
asked
the
elderly
gentleman
a
man
drenched
blackened
and
bloodstained
whom
i
had
not
before
observed
here
said
a
noo
dog
sir
dumps
by
name
come
to
us
this
wery
day
we
putt
in
the
scullery
for
the
night
again
i
made
a
desperate
effort
to
return
to
the
burning
house
but
was
restrained
as
before
all
right
sir
whispered
a
fireman
in
a
confidential
tone
i
know
the
scullery
the
fire
ai
got
down
there
yet
your
dog
can
only
have
bin
damaged
by
water
as
yet
i
save
sir
never
fear
he
went
off
with
a
quiet
little
nod
that
did
much
to
comfort
me
meanwhile
the
elderly
gentleman
sought
to
induce
me
to
leave
the
place
and
obtain
refreshment
in
the
house
of
a
friendly
neighbour
who
had
taken
in
his
family
you
need
rest
my
dear
sir
he
said
come
i
must
take
you
in
hand
you
have
rendered
me
a
service
which
i
can
never
repay
what
obstinate
do
you
know
that
i
am
a
doctor
sir
and
must
be
obeyed
i
smiled
but
refused
to
move
until
the
fate
of
dumps
was
ascertained
presently
the
fireman
returned
with
my
doggie
in
his
arms
poor
dumps
he
was
a
pitiable
sight
tons
of
hot
water
had
been
pouring
on
his
devoted
head
and
his
shaggy
shapeless
coat
was
so
plastered
to
his
long
little
body
that
he
looked
more
like
a
drowned
weazel
than
a
terrier
he
was
trembling
violently
and
whined
piteously
as
they
gave
him
to
me
nevertheless
he
attempted
to
wag
his
tail
and
lick
my
hands
in
both
attempts
he
failed
his
tail
was
too
wet
to
wag
but
it
wriggled
he
have
saved
himself
sir
said
the
man
who
brought
him
only
there
was
a
rope
round
his
neck
which
had
caught
on
a
and
held
him
he
not
hurt
sir
though
he
do
seem
as
if
some
one
had
bin
tryin
to
choke
him
my
poor
doggie
said
i
fondling
him
he
wo
want
washin
for
some
time
to
come
observed
one
of
the
bystanders
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
come
now
the
dog
is
safe
you
have
no
reason
for
refusing
to
go
with
me
said
the
elderly
gentleman
who
i
now
understood
was
the
master
of
the
burning
house
as
we
walked
away
he
asked
my
name
and
profession
and
i
thought
he
smiled
with
peculiar
satisfaction
when
i
said
i
was
a
student
of
medicine
oh
indeed
he
said
well
we
shall
see
but
here
we
are
this
is
the
house
of
my
good
friend
dobson
city
man
capital
fellow
like
all
city
men
ahem
he
has
put
his
house
at
my
disposal
at
this
very
trying
period
of
my
existence
but
are
you
sure
dr
mctougall
that
the
household
is
saved
i
asked
becoming
more
thoroughly
awake
to
the
tremendous
reality
of
the
scene
through
which
i
had
just
passed
sure
my
good
fellow
think
i
be
talking
thus
quietly
to
you
if
i
were
sure
yes
thanks
to
you
and
the
firemen
under
god
there
not
a
hair
of
their
heads
injured
are
you
i
beg
pardon
are
you
quite
sure
have
you
seen
miss
mctougall
since
she
miss
mctougall
exclaimed
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
mean
my
little
jenny
by
that
dignified
title
well
of
course
i
did
not
know
her
name
and
she
is
not
large
but
i
brought
her
down
the
shoot
with
such
violence
that
an
explosion
of
laughter
from
the
doctor
stopped
me
as
i
entered
a
large
library
the
powerful
lights
of
which
at
first
dazzled
me
here
dobson
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
man
who
has
saved
my
whole
family
and
who
has
mistaken
miss
blythe
for
my
jenny
why
sir
he
continued
turning
to
me
the
bundle
you
brought
down
so
unceremoniously
is
only
my
governess
ah
i
give
twenty
thousand
pounds
down
on
the
spot
if
she
were
only
my
daughter
my
jenny
will
be
a
lucky
woman
if
she
grows
up
to
be
like
her
i
congratulate
you
mr
mellon
said
the
city
man
shaking
me
warmly
by
the
hand
you
have
acted
with
admirable
promptitude
which
is
most
important
at
a
fire
and
they
tell
me
that
the
header
you
took
into
the
escape
with
miss
blythe
in
your
arms
was
the
finest
acrobatic
feat
that
has
been
seen
off
the
stage
i
say
dobson
where
have
you
stowed
my
wife
and
the
children
i
want
to
introduce
him
to
them
in
the
returned
the
city
man
you
see
i
thought
it
would
be
more
agreeable
that
they
should
be
all
together
until
their
nerves
are
calmed
so
i
had
mattresses
blankets
etcetera
brought
down
being
a
bachelor
as
you
know
i
could
do
nothing
more
than
place
the
wardrobes
of
my
domestics
at
the
disposal
of
the
ladies
the
things
are
not
indeed
a
very
good
fit
but
this
way
mr
mellon
the
city
man
who
was
tall
and
handsome
ushered
his
guests
into
what
he
styled
his
hospital
and
there
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
wall
were
five
shakedowns
with
a
child
on
each
seldom
have
i
beheld
a
finer
sight
than
the
sparkling
lustre
of
their
ten
still
glaring
eyes
two
pleasant
young
domestics
were
engaged
in
feeding
the
smaller
ones
with
jam
and
pudding
we
arrange
the
words
advisedly
because
the
jam
was
out
of
all
proportion
too
much
for
the
pudding
the
elder
children
were
feeding
themselves
with
the
same
materials
and
in
the
same
relative
proportions
mrs
mctougall
in
a
blue
cotton
gown
with
white
spots
which
belonged
to
the
housemaid
reclined
on
a
sofa
she
was
deadly
pale
and
the
expression
of
horror
was
not
quite
removed
from
her
countenance
beside
her
administering
restoratives
sat
miss
blythe
in
a
chintz
dress
belonging
to
the
cook
which
was
ridiculously
too
large
for
her
she
was
dishevelled
and
flushed
and
looked
so
pleasantly
anxious
about
mrs
mctougall
that
i
almost
forgave
her
having
robbed
me
of
my
doggie
miss
blythe
your
deliverer
cried
the
little
doctor
who
seemed
to
delight
in
blowing
my
trumpet
with
the
loudest
possible
blast
my
dear
your
preserver
i
bowed
in
some
confusion
and
stammered
something
incoherently
mrs
mctougall
said
something
else
languidly
and
miss
blythe
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
pleasant
smile
well
if
this
is
one
of
the
very
jolliest
larks
i
ever
had
exclaimed
master
harry
from
his
corner
between
two
enormous
spoonfuls
hah
exclaimed
master
jack
he
could
say
no
more
he
was
too
busy
we
all
laughed
and
much
to
my
relief
general
attention
was
turned
to
the
little
ones
you
young
scamps
the
will
cost
me
some
thousands
of
pounds
said
the
doctor
never
mind
papa
just
go
to
the
bank
and
they
give
you
as
much
as
you
want
more
pooding
demanded
master
job
the
domestic
hesitated
oh
give
it
him
act
the
banker
on
this
occasion
and
give
him
as
much
as
he
wants
said
the
doctor
good
papa
exclaimed
the
overjoyed
jenny
how
i
wis
we
had
a
house
on
fire
every
night
even
dolly
crowed
with
delight
at
this
as
if
she
really
appreciated
the
idea
and
continued
her
own
supper
with
increased
fervour
thus
did
that
remarkable
family
spend
the
small
hours
of
that
morning
while
their
home
was
being
burned
to
ashes
chapter
seven
my
circumstances
begin
to
brighten
robin
said
old
mrs
willis
from
her
bed
in
the
wheeziest
of
voices
who
robin
granny
demanded
young
slidder
in
some
surprise
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
stooped
at
the
fire
to
stir
a
pan
of
gruel
you
are
robin
returned
the
old
lady
following
up
the
remark
with
a
feeble
sneeze
i
ca
stand
slidder
it
is
such
an
ugly
name
besides
you
ought
to
have
a
christian
name
child
do
you
like
robin
the
boy
chuckled
a
little
as
he
stirred
the
gruel
vell
i
ai
had
it
long
enough
to
made
up
my
mind
on
the
but
you
may
call
me
wot
you
please
granny
as
you
do
swear
i
answer
to
robin
or

by
the
way
i
wo
answer
to
flogin
i
do
like
that
but
why

sighed
the
old
woman
because
i
once
had
a
dear
little
son
so
named
he
died
when
he
was
about
your
age
and
your
kindly
ways
are
so
like
his
that
hallo
granny
interrupted
slidder
standing
up
with
a
look
of
intense
surprise
are
you
took
bad
no
why
you
said
suthin
about
that
looks
suspicious
did
i
robin
i
did
mean
to
but
as
i
was
saying
i
like
to
call
you
robin
because
it
reminds
me
of
my
little
darling
who
is
now
in
heaven
ah
robin
was
so
gentle
and
loving
and
tender
and
true
and
kind
he
a
good
boy
a
wheezing
which
culminated
in
another
feeble
sneeze
here
silenced
the
poor
old
thing
for
some
minutes
after
that
slidder
devoted
himself
to
vigorous
stirring
of
the
gruel
and
to
repressed
laughter
which
latter
made
him
very
red
in
the
face
and
caused
his
shoulders
to
heave
convulsively
at
last
he
sought
relief
in
occasional
mutterings
think
he
said
quoting
mrs
willis
words
in
a
scarcely
audible
whisper
gentle
an
lovin
an
tender
an
true
kind
an
sitch
a
good
boy
too
an
kindly

your
little
touches
of
humour

like
him
said
the
old
woman
with
a
mingled
smile
and
sneeze
as
she
slowly
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
making
a
cone
of
the
bedclothes
with
her
knees
on
which
she
laid
her
thin
hands
come

old
said
slidder
seriously

on
like
that
you

happetite
now

murmured
the
old
woman
as
she
gazed
in
slidder
face
and
it
is
so
good
of

to
give
up
your
play
and
come
to
look
after
a
helpless
old
creature

the
boy
with
an
air
of
profound
gravity
i
was
used
to
sleep
under
a
damp
archway
or
in
a
wet
cask
i

by

granny
i
made
great
sacrifices

i
come
to

mrs
willis
smiled
sneezed
and
began
her
gruel
slidder
who
looked
at
her
with
deep
interest
was
called
away
by
a
knock
at
the
door
opening
it
he
beheld
a
tall
footman
with
a
parcel
in
his
hand
does
a
mrs
willis

asked
no
replied
slidder
a
mrs
willis
do
live
here
but
mrs
willis
the
one
vurth
speakin
of
does
ah
replied
the
man
with
a
smile
for
he
was
an
amiable
footman
and
i
suppose
you
are
young
slidder
i
am
slidder
sir
and
i
would
you
remember
said
the
urchin
with
dignity
that
every
englishman
is
his
castle
and
that
neither
imperence
nor
flunkies
a
right
to
enter
indeed
exclaimed
the
man
with
affected
surprise
then
i
afraid
this
castle
ca
be
a
strong
one
or
it
ai
well
guarded
for
got
into
it
somehow
when
entered
good
good
returned
the
boy
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
worthy
of
the
east
end
you
should
bin
one
of
now
then
old
wot
your
business
to
deliver
this
parcel
it
over
then
but
i
am
also
to
see
mrs
willis
and
ask
how
she
is
walk
in
then
an
wipe
your
feet
we
ai
got
a
it
like
christmas
but
you
may
use
the
boards
in
the
meantime
the
footman
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
gossipy
man
and
soon
won
the
hearts
of
old
mrs
willis
and
her
young
guardian
he
had
been
sent
he
said
by
a
dr
mctougall
with
a
parcel
containing
wine
tea
sugar
rice
and
a
few
other
articles
of
food
and
with
a
message
that
the
doctor
would
call
and
see
mrs
willis
that
afternoon
deary
me
that
very
kind
said
the
old
woman
but
i
wonder
why
he
sent
such
things
to
me
and
who
told
him
i
was
in
want
of
it
was
a
young
gentleman
who
rescued
most
of
the
doctor
family
from
a
fire
last
night
his
name
i
believe
is
mellon
wot
doctor
john
mellon
exclaimed
slidder
with
widening
eyes
whether
he
john
or
doctor
i
can
not
tell
all
i
know
is
that
mellon
and
he
bin
rather
knocked
up
by
but
bless
me
i
forgot
i
was
to
say
nothing
about
the
the
fire
till
dr
mctougall
had
seen
you
how
stoopid
of
me
but
things
slip
out
he
stopped
abruptly
and
placed
his
brown
paper
parcel
on
the
bed
now
i
say
look
here
mister
or
wotever
your
name
said
slidder
with
intense
eagerness
it
of
no
use
your
tyin
up
the
mouth
o
the
bag
now
the
cat
got
out
an
ca
be
got
in
again
by
no
manner
o
means
just
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
an
tell
it
all
out
like
a
man
there
a
good
feller
if
you
do
i
tell
dr
mctougall
that
you
gave
me
an
the
old
lady
a
full
true
an
partikler
account
o
the
whole
affair
from
the
fust
bustin
out
o
the
flames
an
the
calling
o
the
to
the
last
crash
o
the
fallin
roof
and
the
roastin
alive
of
the
cat
i
will
as
sure
as
a
flunkey
thus
adjured
and
threatened
the
gossipy
footman
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
told
them
how
that
i
had
acted
like
a
hero
at
the
fire
and
then
after
giving
in
minute
detail
an
account
of
all
that
the
reader
already
knows
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
whole
family
except
dr
mctougall
was
laid
up
with
colds
that
the
governess
was
in
a
high
fever
that
the
having
been
rescued
on
the
shoulders
of
firemen
from
the
attics
were
completely
broken
down
in
their
nerves
and
that
i
had
received
an
injury
to
my
right
leg
which
although
i
had
said
nothing
about
it
on
the
night
of
the
fire
had
become
so
much
worse
in
the
morning
that
i
could
scarcely
walk
across
the
room
in
these
circumstances
he
added
dr
mctougall
had
agreed
to
visit
my
poor
people
for
me
until
i
should
recover
you
see
continued
the
footman
i
only
heard
a
little
of
their
conversation
dr
mctougall
was
saying
when
i
come
into
the
room
mr
mellon
he
said
must
of
necessity
remain
where
you
are
and
you
could
not
let
me
tell
you
be
in
better
quarters
i
will
look
after
your
patients
till
you
are
able
to
go
about
again
which
wo
be
long
i
hope
and
i
make
a
particular
note
of
your
old
woman
and
send
her
some
wine
and
things
immediately
i
suppose
he
meant
you
added
the
footman
but
having
to
leave
the
room
again
owing
to
some
of
the
children
howling
for
jam
and
pudding
i
heard
no
more
having
thus
delivered
himself
of
his
tale
and
parcel
the
tall
footman
took
his
leave
with
many
expressions
of
now
granny
remarked
young
slidder
as
he
untied
the
parcel
and
spread
its
contents
on
the
small
deal
table
i
got
a
wague
suspicion
that
the
gone
to
hashes
is
the
wery
in
dr
mellon
put
his
little
dog
last
night
why
ai
it
the
same
identical
street
an
the
same
side
o
the
street
and
about
the
same
part
o
the
street
an
did
both
him
and
me
forgit
to
ask
the
name
o
the
people
o
the
or
to
look
at
the
number
so
took
up
was
we
with
partin
from
punch
wot
more
than
for
him
to
go
round
on
way
back
to
look
at
the
supposin
he
was
too
late
to
call
then
did
that
say
a
terrier
dog
reskooed
from
the
lower
premises
to
be
sure
there
many
a
terrier
dog
in
london
but
then
did
he
likewise
say
that
the
o
the
family
is
a
pretty
gal
wot
more
likely
than
that
she
young
lady
all
that
you
see
granny
is
what
the
magistrates
would
call
presumptuous
evidence
but
i
go
and
inquire
for
myself
this
wery
evenin
you
all
settled
an
an
i
got
mrs
jones
to
look
arter
you
that
evening
accordingly
when
robin
slidder
as
i
shall
now
call
him
was
away
making
his
inquiries
dr
mctougall
called
on
mrs
willis
she
was
very
weak
and
low
at
the
time
the
memory
of
her
lost
edie
had
been
heavy
upon
her
and
she
felt
strangely
disinclined
to
talk
the
kindly
doctor
did
not
disturb
her
more
than
was
sufficient
to
fully
investigate
her
case
when
about
to
depart
he
took
mrs
jones
into
the
passage
now
my
good
woman
he
said
i
hope
you
will
see
the
instructions
you
heard
me
give
to
mrs
willis
carried
out
she
is
very
low
but
with
good
food
and
careful
nursing
may
do
well
can
you
give
her
much
of
your
time
la
sir
yes
i
a
lone
woman
sir
with
nothin
to
do
but
take
care
of
myself
an
i
that
fond
of
mrs
willis
she
like
my
own
mother
very
good
and
what
of
this
boy
who
has
come
to
live
with
her
think
he
is
steady
to
be
depended
on
indeed
i
do
sir
replied
mrs
jones
with
much
earnestness
though
he
did
come
from
nowheres
in
partiklar
an
do
to
nobody
a
good
boy
is
little
slidder
and
a
better
nurse
you
not
find
in
all
the
hospitals
i
wish
i
had
found
him
at
home
will
you
give
him
this
card
and
tell
him
to
call
on
me
morning
between
eight
and
nine
let
him
ask
particularly
for
me
dr
mctougall
i
not
in
my
own
house
but
in
a
friend
at
present
i
was
burnt
out
of
my
house
last
night
oh
sir
exclaimed
mrs
jones
with
a
shocked
expression
yes
accidents
will
happen
you
know
to
the
most
careful
among
us
mrs
jones
said
the
little
doctor
with
a
smile
as
he
drew
on
his
gloves
good
evening
take
care
of
your
patient
now
i
much
interested
in
her
case
because
of
the
young
doctor
who
visits
her
sometimes
dr
mellon
exclaimed
the
woman
yes
you
know
him
know
him
i
should
think
i
do
he
has
great
consideration
for
the
poor
ah
he
a
gentleman
is
mr
mellon
he
is
more
than
a
gentleman
mrs
jones
said
the
little
doctor
with
a
kindly
nod
as
he
turned
and
hurried
away
it
may
perhaps
seem
to
savour
of
vanity
and
egotism
my
recording
this
conversation
but
i
do
it
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
showing
how
much
of
hearty
gratitude
there
is
for
mere
trifles
among
the
poor
for
the
woman
who
was
thus
complimentary
to
me
never
received
a
farthing
of
money
from
my
hands
and
i
am
not
aware
of
having
ever
taken
any
notice
of
her
except
now
and
then
wishing
her
a
respectful
and
making
a
few
inquiries
as
to
her
health
that
night
dr
mctougall
came
to
me
on
returning
from
his
rounds
to
report
upon
my
district
i
was
in
bed
at
the
time
and
suffering
considerable
pain
from
my
bruised
and
swollen
limb
dumps
was
lying
at
my
feet
dried
refreshed
and
none
the
worse
for
his
adventures
i
may
mention
that
i
occupied
a
comfortable
room
in
the
house
of
the
city
man
who
insisted
on
my
staying
with
him
until
i
should
be
quite
able
to
walk
to
my
lodgings
as
dr
mctougall
had
taken
my
district
a
brief
note
to
mrs
miff
my
landlady
relieved
my
mind
of
all
anxieties
professional
and
domestic
so
that
my
doggie
and
i
could
enjoy
ourselves
as
well
as
the
swollen
leg
would
permit
my
dear
young
friend
said
the
little
doctor
as
he
entered
your
patients
are
all
going
on
admirably
and
as
i
mean
to
send
my
assistant
to
them
regularly
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
easy
i
seen
your
old
woman
too
and
she
is
charming
i
do
wonder
you
lost
your
heart
to
her
your
young
however
was
absent
the
scamp
but
he
had
provided
a
good
nurse
to
take
his
place
in
the
person
of
mrs
jones
i
know
her
well
said
i
she
is
a
capital
nurse
little
slidder
has
i
am
told
been
here
in
your
absence
but
unfortunately
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
to
him
would
not
let
him
see
me
as
i
happened
to
be
asleep
at
the
time
however
he
be
sure
to
call
again
but
you
have
not
told
me
yet
how
miss
blythe
is
well
i
not
had
time
to
tell
you
replied
the
doctor
with
a
smile
i
sorry
to
say
she
is
rather
feverish
the
excitement
and
exposure
to
the
night
air
were
a
severe
trial
to
her
for
although
she
is
naturally
strong
it
is
not
long
since
she
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
nothing
however
surprises
me
so
much
as
the
way
in
which
my
dear
wife
has
come
through
it
all
it
seems
to
have
given
her
quite
a
turn
in
the
right
direction
why
she
used
to
be
as
timid
as
a
mouse
now
she
scoffs
at
burglars
after
what
occurred
last
night
she
says
she
will
fear
nothing
under
the
sun
is
it
odd
as
for
the
children
i
afraid
the
event
has
roused
all
that
is
wild
and
savage
in
their
natures
they
were
kicking
up
a
horrible
shindy
when
i
passed
the
the
hospital
as
dobson
calls
it
so
i
opened
the
door
and
peeped
in
there
they
were
all
standing
up
on
their
beds
shouting
fire
engines
escapes
come
i
shouted
papa
they
screamed
in
delight
you
think
we
had
for
supper
what
and
and
jam
nearly
jam
then
they
burst
again
into
a
chorus
of
yells
for
engines
and
while
little
dolly
voice
rang
high
above
the
rest
and
dam
dam
fire
and
feeves
as
i
shut
the
door
but
now
a
word
in
your
ear
before
i
leave
you
for
the
night
perhaps
it
may
not
surprise
you
to
be
told
that
i
have
an
extensive
practice
after
getting
into
a
new
house
which
i
must
do
immediately
i
shall
want
an
assistant
who
may
in
course
of
time
perhaps
become
a
partner
understand
are
you
open
to
a
proposal
my
dear
sir
said
i
your
kindness
is
very
great
but
you
know
that
i
am
not
yet
yes
yes
i
know
all
about
that
i
merely
wish
to
inject
an
idea
into
your
brain
and
leave
it
there
to
fructify
go
to
sleep
now
my
dear
young
fellow
and
let
me
wish
you
agreeable
dreams
with
a
warm
squeeze
of
the
hand
and
a
pleasant
nod
my
new
friend
said
and
left
me
to
my
meditations
chapter
eight
little
slidder
resists
temptation
successfully
and
i
become
enslaved
pompey
said
i
one
afternoon
while
reclining
on
the
sofa
in
my
leg
being
not
yet
sufficiently
restored
to
admit
of
my
going
out
pompey
i
got
news
for
you
to
my
surprise
my
doggie
would
not
answer
to
that
name
at
all
when
i
used
it
though
he
did
so
when
it
was
used
by
miss
blythe
dumps
i
said
in
a
somewhat
injured
tone
ears
and
tail
at
once
replied
come
now
punch
i
said
rather
sternly
i
call
you
what
i
please
punch
dumps
or
pompey
because
you
are
dog
still
at
least
as
long
as
your
mistress
and
i
live
under
the
same
roof
so
sir
if
you
take
the
dumps
when
i
call
you
pompey
i
punch
your
head
for
you
evidently
the
dog
thought
this
a
very
flat
jest
for
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
whatever
now
dumps
come
here
and
let
be
friends
who
do
you
think
is
coming
to
stay
with
us
to
stay
altogether
you
never
guess
your
old
friend
and
first
master
little
slidder
no
less
think
of
that
dumps
wagged
his
tail
vigorously
whether
at
the
news
or
because
of
pleasure
at
my
brushing
the
hair
off
his
soft
brown
eyes
and
looking
into
them
i
can
not
tell
yes
i
continued
it
quite
true
this
fire
will
apparently
be
the
making
of
little
slidder
as
well
as
you
and
me
for
we
are
all
going
to
live
and
work
together
is
that
nice
evidently
dr
mctougall
is
a
trump
and
so
is
his
friend
dobson
who
puts
this
fine
mansion
at
his
disposal
until
another
home
can
be
got
ready
for
us
i
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
an
uproarious
burst
of
laughter
from
the
doctor
himself
who
had
entered
by
the
open
door
unobserved
by
me
i
joined
in
the
laugh
against
myself
but
blushed
nevertheless
for
man
does
not
like
as
a
rule
to
be
caught
talking
earnestly
either
to
himself
or
to
a
dumb
creature
why
mellon
he
said
sitting
down
beside
me
and
patting
my
dog
i
imagined
from
your
tones
as
i
entered
that
you
were
having
some
serious
conversation
with
my
wife
no
mrs
mctougall
has
not
yet
returned
from
her
drive
i
was
merely
having
a
chat
with
dumps
i
had
of
late
in
my
lodgings
got
into
a
way
of
thinking
aloud
as
it
were
while
talking
to
my
dog
i
suppose
it
was
with
an
unconscious
desire
to
break
the
silence
of
my
room
no
doubt
no
doubt
replied
the
doctor
with
a
touch
of
sympathy
in
his
tone
you
must
have
been
rather
lonely
in
that
attic
of
yours
and
yet
do
you
know
i
sometimes
sigh
for
the
quiet
of
such
an
attic
perhaps
when
you
been
some
months
under
the
same
roof
with
these
miniature
thunderstorms
jack
harry
job
jenny
and
dolly
you
long
to
go
back
to
the
attic
a
tremendous
thump
on
the
floor
overhead
followed
by
a
wild
uproar
sent
the
doctor
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
stride
i
sat
prudently
still
till
he
returned
which
he
did
in
a
few
minutes
laughing
what
think
it
was
he
cried
panting
only
my
dolly
tumbling
off
the
chest
of
drawers
my
babes
have
many
pleasant
little
games
among
others
cutting
off
the
heads
of
dreadful
traitors
is
a
great
favourite
they
roll
up
a
sheet
into
a
ball
for
the
head
then
each
of
them
is
led
in
turn
to
the
scaffold
which
is
the
top
of
a
chest
of
drawers
one
holds
the
ball
against
the
criminal
shoulders
another
cuts
it
off
with
a
wooden
knife
a
basket
receives
it
below
then
one
of
them
takes
it
out
and
holding
it
aloft
shouts
the
head
of
a
traitor
it
seems
that
four
criminals
had
been
safely
decapitated
and
dolly
was
being
led
to
the
fatal
block
when
she
slipped
her
foot
and
fell
to
the
ground
overturning
harry
and
a
chair
in
her
descent
that
was
all
not
hurt
i
hope
oh
no
they
never
get
hurt
seriously
hurt
i
mean
as
to
shins
scratches
cuts
and
bumps
they
may
be
said
to
exist
in
a
perpetually
maimed
condition
strange
said
i
musingly
that
they
should
like
to
play
at
such
a
disagreeable
subject
disagreeable
exclaimed
my
friend
pooh
that
nothing
you
should
see
them
playing
at
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
my
poor
wife
sometimes
shudders
at
the
idea
that
we
have
been
gifted
with
five
monsters
of
cruelty
but
any
one
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
it
is
a
fine
sense
of
the
propriety
of
retributive
justice
that
influences
them
any
one
who
chooses
to
go
and
look
at
the
five
innocent
faces
when
they
are
asleep
said
i
laughing
can
see
with
a
of
an
eye
that
you
and
mrs
mctougall
are
to
be
congratulated
on
the
nature
of
your
little
ones
of
course
we
are
my
dear
fellow
returned
the
doctor
with
enthusiasm
but
to
change
the
subject
has
little
slidder
been
here
not
that
i
know
of
ah
there
he
is
said
the
doctor
as
at
that
instant
the
rang
there
is
insolence
in
the
very
tone
of
his
ring
he
has
pulled
the
visitor
bell
too
and
there
goes
the
knocker
of
all
the
imps
that
walk
a
london
is
the
sentence
was
cut
short
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entrance
of
my
little
he
had
evidently
got
himself
up
for
the
occasion
for
his
shoeblack
uniform
had
been
well
brushed
his
hands
and
face
severely
washed
and
his
hair
plastered
well
down
with
come
in
slidder
that
your
name
is
it
said
the
doctor
it
is
sir
robin
slidder
at
your
sarvice
replied
the
urchin
giving
me
a
familiar
nod
your
leg
ai
so
cranky
as
it
wos
sir
gittin
all
square
eh
i
repressed
a
smile
with
difficulty
as
i
replied
it
is
much
better
thank
you
attend
to
what
dr
mctougall
has
to
say
to
you
hall
serene
he
replied
looking
with
cool
urbanity
in
the
face
fire
away
you
a
shoeblack
i
see
said
the
doctor
that
my
purfession

does
my
friend
mr
mellon
tells
me
that
you
a
very
good
boy
little
slidder
looked
at
me
with
a
solemn
reproachful
air
oh
a
wopper
he
said
we
both
laughed
at
this
come
slidder
said
i
you
must
learn
to
treat
us
with
more
respect
else
i
shall
have
to
change
my
opinion
of

an
here

to
say
to
me
that
the
can

and
write
resumed
the
doctor
not
replied
the
boy
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
been
insulted
wot
take
me
for
think
i
a
genius
as
can
read
an
write
without
bin
taught
or
think
i
a
monster
as
wos
born
readin
an
writin
i
no
school
to
go
to
nor
nobody
to
putt
me
there
i
thought
the
school
board
looked
after
such
as
you
so
they
does
sir
but
i
been
too
many
for
the
then
it
your
own
fault
that
you
not
been
taught
said
the
doctor
somewhat
severely
not
at
all
returned
the
urchin
with
quiet
assurance
it
the
dooty
o
the
to
ketch
me
an
they
ca
ketch
me
that
not
my
fault
it
my
superiority
my
friend
looked
at
the
little
creature
before
him
with
much
surprise
after
a
few
seconds
contemplation
and
thought
he
continued
well
slidder
as
my
friend
here
says
you
are
a
good
sort
of
boy
i
am
bound
to
believe
him
though
appearances
are
somewhat
against
you
now
i
am
in
want
of
a
smart
boy
at
present
to
attend
to
the
show
patients
into
my
run
messages
in
short
make
himself
generally
useful
about
the
house
how
would
such
a
situation
suit
you
doctor
said
the
boy
ignoring
the
question
how
could
any
boy
attend
on
your
it
burnt
to
hashes
we
will
manage
to
have
another
door
replied
dr
mctougall
with
a
forbearing
smile
meanwhile
you
could
practise
on
the
door
of
this
but
that
is
not
answering
my
question
boy
how
would
you
like
the
place
you
have
light
work
a
good
salary
pleasant
society
below
stairs
and
a
blue
uniform
in
short
i
make
a
of
you
wot
about
the
wittles
demanded
this
remarkable
boy
of
course
you
fare
as
well
as
the
other
servants
returned
the
doctor
rather
testily
for
his
opinion
of
my
little
friend
was
rapidly
falling
i
could
see
that
to
my
regret
now
give
me
an
answer
at
once
he
continued
sharply

amazement

stupid

said
i
what
possesses

refuse

good
an
offer
dr
mellon
he
replied
turning
on
me
with
a
flush
of
unwonted
earnestness
think
i
be
so
shabby
so
low
so
mean
as
to

forsake

dr

before

any
hodd
bits
real
noos
i
to
git
hold
of
but
i
ai
partickler
apparently
not
said
the
doctor
laughing
well
i
see
it
of
no
use
tempting
you
to
forsake
your
present
position
indeed
i
would
not
wish
you
to
leave
it
some
day
i
may
find
means
to
have
old
mrs
willis
taken
better
care
of
and
then
well
we
shall
see
meanwhile
i
respect
your
feelings
and
give
my
regards
to
granny
say
i
be
over
to
see
her
soon
stay
said
i
as
the
boy
turned
to
leave
you
never
told
me
that
one
of
your
names
was
robin
it
was
i
saw
you
last
i
only
got
it
a
few
days
ago
indeed
from
whom
from
granny
willis
she
gave
me
the
name
an
i
likes
it
an
mean
to
stick
by
it
good
arternoon
ta
ta
punch
at
the
word
my
doggie
bounced
from
under
my
hand
and
began
to
leap
joyfully
round
the
boy
i
say
said
robin
pausing
at
the
door
and
looking
back
all
right
i
gittin
better
who
do
you
mean
the
in
course
my
young
lady
oh
yes
i
am
happy
to
say
she
is
better
said
the
doctor
much
amused
by
the
anxious
look
of
the
face
which
had
hitherto
been
the
quintessence
of
cool
but
she
has
had
a
great
shake
and
will
have
to
be
sent
to
the
country
for
change
of
air
when
we
can
venture
to
move
her
i
confess
that
i
was
much
surprised
but
not
a
little
gratified
by
the
very
decided
manner
in
which
slidder
avowed
his
determination
to
stand
fast
by
the
poor
old
woman
in
whom
i
had
been
led
to
take
so
strong
an
interest
hitherto
i
had
felt
some
uncertainty
as
to
how
far
i
could
depend
on
the
boy
affection
for
mrs
willis
and
his
steadiness
of
purpose
now
i
felt
quite
sure
of
him
dr
mctougall
felt
as
i
did
in
the
matter
and
so
did
his
friend
the
city
man
i
had
half
expected
that
dobson
would
have
laughed
at
us
for
what
he
sometimes
styled
our
softness
because
he
had
so
much
to
do
with
sharpers
and
sharp
practice
but
i
was
mistaken
he
quite
agreed
with
us
in
our
opinion
of
my
little
waif
and
spoke
admiringly
of
those
who
sought
through
evil
and
good
report
to
rescue
our
city
arabs
from
destruction
and
dobson
did
more
than
speak
he
gave
liberally
out
of
his
ample
fortune
to
the
good
cause
that
evening
just
after
the
gas
was
lighted
while
i
was
lying
on
the
sofa
thinking
of
these
things
and
toying
with
dumps
ears
the
door
opened
and
mrs
mctougall
entered
with
miss
blythe
leaning
on
her
arm
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
come
down
to
the
since
her
illness
she
was
thin
and
pale
but
to
my
mind
more
beautiful
than
ever
for
her
brown
eyes
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
more
lustrous
as
they
beamed
upon
me
i
leaped
up
sending
an
agonising
shoot
of
pain
through
my
leg
and
hastened
to
meet
her
dumps
as
if
jealous
of
me
sprang
wildly
on
before
and
danced
round
his
mistress
in
a
whirlwind
of
delight
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
miss
blythe
i
stammered
i
had
feared
the
consequences
of
that
terrible
night
that
rude
descent
you
you
are
better
i
thank
you
much
better
she
replied
with
a
sweet
smile
and
how
shall
i
ever
express
my
debt
of
gratitude
to
you
mr
mellon
she
extended
her
delicate
hand
i
grasped
it
she
shook
mine
heartily
that
shake
fixed
my
fate
no
doubt
it
was
the
simple
and
natural
expression
of
a
grateful
heart
for
a
really
important
service
but
i
cared
nothing
about
that
she
blushed
as
i
looked
at
her
and
stooped
to
pat
the
jealous
and
impatient
dumps
sit
here
darling
on
this
said
mrs
mctougall
you
know
the
doctor
allows
you
only
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
at
most
you
may
be
up
longer
there
and
you
are
not
to
speak
much
mr
mellon
you
must
address
yourself
to
me
lilly
is
only
allowed
to
listen
yes
as
you
truly
said
mr
mellon
continued
the
good
lady
who
was
somewhat
garrulous
her
descent
was
rough
and
indeed
so
was
mine
oh
i
shall
never
forget
that
rough
monster
into
whose
arms
you
thrust
me
that
awful
night
but
he
was
a
brave
and
strong
monster
too
he
just
gathered
me
up
like
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
went
crashing
down
the
blazing
stair
through
fire
and
smoke
and
through
bricks
and
mortar
too
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
noise
and
shocks
but
we
came
out
safe
thank
god
and
i
had
not
a
scratch
though
i
noticed
that
my
hair
and
beard
were
on
fire
and
his
face
was
cut
and
bleeding
i
think
how
he
carried
me
so
safely
ah
the
firemen
have
a
knack
of
doing
that
sort
of
thing
said
i
speaking
to
mrs
mctougall
but
looking
at
lilly
blythe
so
i
have
heard
the
brave
noble
men
said
lilly
speaking
to
mrs
mctougall
but
looking
at
me
i
know
not
what
we
conversed
about
during
the
remainder
of
that
hour
whether
i
talked
sense
or
nonsense
i
can
not
tell
the
only
thing
i
am
quite
sure
of
is
that
i
talked
incessantly
enthusiastically
to
mrs
mctougall
but
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
lilly
blythe
all
the
time
and
i
know
that
lilly
blushed
a
good
deal
and
bent
her
pretty
head
frequently
over
her
darling
pompey
and
fondled
him
to
his
heart
content
that
night
my
leg
violently
resented
the
treatment
it
had
received
when
i
slept
i
dreamed
that
i
was
on
the
rack
and
that
miss
blythe
strange
to
say
was
the
chief
tormentor
while
dumps
quietly
looked
on
and
laughed
yes
deliberately
laughed
at
my
sufferings
chapter
nine
on
the
scent
but
puzzled
it
was
a
considerable
time
after
the
fire
before
my
leg
permitted
me
to
resume
my
studies
and
my
duties
among
the
poor
meanwhile
i
had
become
a
inmate
of
mr
dobson
house
and
was
styled
dr
mctougall
assistant
i
confess
that
i
had
some
hesitation
at
first
in
accepting
such
generous
hospitality
but
feeling
that
i
could
not
help
myself
till
my
leg
should
recover
i
became
reconciled
to
it
then
as
time
advanced
the
doctor
who
was
an
experimental
chemist
as
well
as
a
found
me
so
useful
to
him
in
his
laboratory
that
i
felt
i
was
really
earning
my
board
and
lodging
meanwhile
lilly
blythe
had
been
sent
to
visit
an
aunt
of
dr
mctougall
in
kent
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
this
was
well
i
felt
it
to
be
so
i
knew
that
her
presence
would
have
a
disturbing
influence
on
my
studies
which
were
by
that
time
nearly
completed
i
felt
also
that
it
was
madness
in
me
to
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
whom
i
could
not
hope
to
marry
for
years
even
if
she
were
willing
to
have
me
at
all
which
i
very
much
doubted
i
therefore
resolved
to
put
the
subject
away
from
me
and
devote
myself
heartily
to
my
profession
in
the
spirit
of
that
word
which
tells
us
that
whatsoever
our
hands
find
to
do
we
should
do
it
with
our
might
success
attended
my
efforts
i
passed
all
my
examinations
with
credit
and
became
not
only
a
fixture
in
the
doctor
family
but
as
he
earnestly
assured
me
a
very
great
help
to
him
of
course
i
did
not
mention
the
state
of
my
feelings
towards
lilly
blythe
to
any
one
not
being
in
the
habit
of
having
confidants
except
indeed
to
dumps
in
the
snug
little
room
just
over
the
front
door
which
had
been
given
to
me
as
a
study
i
was
wont
to
pour
out
many
of
my
secret
thoughts
to
my
doggie
as
he
sat
before
me
with
cocked
ears
and
demonstrative
tail
you
been
the
making
of
me
dumps
said
i
one
evening
not
long
after
i
had
reached
the
first
round
of
the
ladder
of
my
profession
it
was
you
who
introduced
me
to
lilly
blythe
and
through
her
to
dr
mctougall
and
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
never
forget
that
nay
you
must
not
be
too
demonstrative
when
your
mistress
left
you
under
my
care
she
said
no
doubt
that
i
was
not
to
steal
your
heart
from
her
was
that
absurd
eh
as
if
any
heart
could
be
stolen
from
of
course
i
can
not
regain
your
heart
dumps
and
i
will
not
even
attempt
it
bright
as
robin
slidder
says
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
that
i
promised
to
go
down
to
see
old
mrs
willis
this
very
night
so
i
leave
you
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
little
mctougalls
as
i
walked
down
the
strand
my
last
remark
to
dumps
recurred
to
me
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
as
i
thought
of
the
tender
mercies
to
which
i
had
referred
the
reader
already
knows
that
the
juvenile
mctougalls
were
somewhat
bloodthirsty
in
their
notions
of
play
when
dumps
was
introduced
to
their
nursery
by
that
time
transferred
from
to
an
upper
floor
they
at
once
adopted
him
with
open
arms
dumps
seemed
to
be
willing
and
fortunately
turned
out
to
be
a
dog
of
exceptionally
he
was
also
tough
no
amount
of
squeezing
bruising
pulling
of
the
ears
or
tail
or
falling
upon
him
either
accidentally
or
on
purpose
could
induce
him
to
bite
he
did
indeed
yell
hideously
at
times
when
much
hurt
and
he
snarled
barked
yelped
growled
and
showed
his
teeth
continually
but
it
was
all
in
play
for
he
was
dearly
fond
of
romps
fortunately
the
tall
nurse
had
been
born
without
nerves
she
was
wont
to
sit
serene
in
a
corner
darning
innumerable
socks
while
a
tornado
was
going
on
around
her
dumps
became
a
sort
of
continual
sacrifice
on
all
occasions
when
a
criminal
was
to
be
decapitated
a
burglar
hanged
or
a
martyr
burned
dumps
was
the
victim
and
many
a
time
was
he
rescued
from
impending
and
real
death
by
the
watchful
nurse
who
was
too
well
aware
of
the
innocent
ignorance
of
her
ferocious
charges
to
leave
dumps
entirely
to
their
tender
mercies
on
reaching
mrs
willis
little
dwelling
i
found
young
slidder
officiating
at
the
i
could
not
resist
watching
him
a
moment
through
a
crack
in
the
door
before
entering
now
then
said
he
you
are
set
to
work
old
sneezer
with
a
will
the
boy
had
got
into
a
facetious
way
of
calling
mrs
willis
by
any
term
of
endearment
that
suggested
itself
at
the
moment
which
would
have
been
highly
improper
and
disrespectful
if
it
had
not
been
the
outflow
of
pure
affection
the
crack
in
the
door
was
not
large
enough
to
permit
of
my
seeing
mrs
willis
herself
as
she
sat
in
her
accustomed
window
with
the
view
i
could
only
see
the
withered
old
hand
held
tremblingly
out
for
the
smoking
cup
of
tea
which
the
boy
handed
to
her
with
a
benignant
smile
and
i
could
hear
the
soft
voice
say
thank
you
robin
dear
boy
so
like
i
tell
you
what
it
is
granny
returned
slidder
with
a
frown
give

comparin
me

other
people

ai
the
way

returned
the
boy
helping
himself
largely
to
the
viands
which
he
so
freely
dispensed
it
not
thankfully
but
heartily
you
ought
to
eat

both
not

all
granny
we
asked
a
blessin
fust

then

next
is
to
go
in
and
win
heartily
arter
that
it
time
enough
to
be
thankful
what
a
boy
it
is
responded
mrs
willis
i
saw
the
withered
old
hand
disappear
with
a
muffin
in
it
in
the
direction
of
the
old
mouth
and
at
this
point
i
entered
the
wery
man
i
wanted
to
see
exclaimed
slidder
jumping
up
with
what
i
thought
unusual
animation
even
for
him
come
along
doctor
just
in
time
for
grub
mrs
w
hai
eat
up
all
the
muffins
yet
fresh
cup
an
saucer
clean
plate
ditto
knife
no
need
for
a
fork
now
then
sit
down
accepting
this
hearty
invitation
i
was
soon
busy
with
a
muffin
while
mrs
willis
gave
a
slow
elaborate
and
graphic
account
of
the
sayings
and
doings
of
master
slidder
which
account
i
need
hardly
say
was
much
in
his
favour
and
i
am
bound
to
add
that
he
listened
to
it
with
pleased
solemnity
now
then
old
flatterer
you
quite
done
you
tell
the
doctor
that
i
wants
a
veek
leave
of
absence
an
then
listen
to
what
him
an
me
got
to
say
on
that
just
keep
a
stuffin
of
yourself
with
muffins
an
do
speak
the
old
lady
nodded
pleasantly
and
began
to
eat
with
apparently
renewed
appetite
while
i
turned
in
some
surprise
a
week
leave
of
absence
said
i
just
so
a
veek
leave
of
absence
furlow
if
you
prefers
to
call
it
so
the
truth
is
i
wants
a
wery
bad
granny

so
an
i
thinks
she
right

my
constitootion

o
brass
or

that

should
be
able

even
doctors

a
now
an
then
much
more
shoeblacks
well
said
i
with
a
laugh
there
is
no
reason
why
shoeblacks
should
not
require
and
desire
a
holiday
as
much
as
other
people
only
unusual
because
they
can
not
afford
it
i
suppose
ah
just
the
shoe
pinches

a
old
shouted
to
me
day
with
a
whack
of
his
umbreller

scrubbed

o
thing
what
between
city
missionaries
an
an
penny
banks
an
cheap
wittles
and
grannies
like
this
here
old
sneezer
it
hardly
possible
for
a
young
feller
to
go
wrong
even
if
he
was
to
try
yes
i
bin
an
saved
enough
to
give
me
a
veek
so
i
goin
to
my
in
the
north
my
requires
it
saying
this
young
slidder
began
to
eat
another
muffin
with
a
degree
of
zest
that
seemed
to
give
the
lie
direct
to
his
assertion
so
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
observing
that
he
did
not
seem
to
be
particularly
ai
i
though
he
remarked
elongating
his
round
rosy
face
as
much
as
possible
that
you
judge
too
much
by
appearances
it
my
body
that
wrong
it
my
spirit
that
wot
the
matter
with
if
you
only
saw
the
inside
o
my
mind
you
be
astonished
i
thoroughly
believe
you
said
i
laughing
and
do
you
really
advise
him
to
go
granny
yes
my
dear
i
do
replied
mrs
willis
in
her
sweet
though
feeble
tones
you
no
idea
how
he
been
slaving
and
working
about
me
i
have
strongly
advised
him
to
go
and
you
know
good
mrs
jones
will
take
his
place
she
as
kind
to
me
as
a
daughter
the
mention
of
the
word
set
the
poor
creature
meditating
on
her
great
loss
she
sighed
deeply
and
turned
her
poor
old
eyes
on
me
with
a
yearning
inquiring
look
i
was
accustomed
to
the
look
by
this
time
and
having
no
good
news
to
give
her
had
latterly
got
into
a
way
of
taking
no
notice
of
it
that
night
however
my
heart
felt
so
sore
for
her
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
speaking
ah
dear
granny
said
i
laying
my
hand
gently
on
her
wrist
would
that
i
had
any
news
to
give
you
but
i
have
none
at
least
not
at
present
but
you
must
not
despair
i
have
failed
up
to
this
time
it
is
true
although
my
inquiries
have
been
frequent
and
carefully
conducted
but
you
know
such
a
search
takes
a
long
time
and
and
london
is
a
large
place
the
unfinished
muffin
dropped
from
the
old
woman
hand
and
she
turned
with
a
deep
sigh
to
the
window
where
the
blank
prospect
was
a
not
inapt
reflection
of
her
own
blank
despair
never
more
she
said
never
more
hope
thou
in
god
for
thou
shalt
yet
praise
him
who
is
the
health
of
thy
countenance
and
thy
god
was
all
that
i
could
say
in
reply
then
i
turned
to
the
boy
who
sat
with
his
eyes
cast
down
as
if
in
deep
thought
and
engaged
him
in
conversation
on
other
subjects
by
way
of
diverting
the
old
woman
mind
from
the
painful
theme
when
i
rose
to
go
slidder
said
he
would
call
mrs
jones
to
mount
guard
and
give
me
a
convoy
home
no
sooner
were
we
in
the
street
than
he
seized
my
hand
and
in
a
voice
of
unusual
earnestness
said
i
got
on
tracks
whose
tracks
what
do
you
mean
on
edie
to
be
sure
edie
willis
talking
eagerly
and
fast
as
we
walked
along
little
slidder
told
me
how
he
had
first
been
put
on
the
scent
by
his
old
friend
and
the
slogger
that
juvenile
burglar
chancing
to
meet
with
slidder
entertained
him
with
a
relation
of
some
of
his
adventures
among
others
he
mentioned
having
many
months
before
been
out
one
afternoon
with
a
certain
mr
brassey
rambling
about
the
streets
with
an
eye
to
any
chance
business
that
might
turn
up
when
they
observed
a
young
and
very
pretty
girl
looking
in
at
various
shop
windows
she
was
obviously
a
lady
but
her
dress
showed
that
she
was
very
poor
her
manner
and
colour
seemed
to
imply
that
she
was
fresh
from
the
country
the
two
thieves
at
once
resolved
to
fleece
her
brassey
advised
the
slogger
to
come
the
soft
dodge
over
her
and
entice
her
if
possible
into
a
neighbouring
court
the
slogger
agreeing
immediately
ran
and
placed
himself
on
a
doorstep
which
the
girl
was
about
to
pass
then
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
began
to
groan
dismally
while
mr
brassey
with
native
politeness
retired
from
the
scene
the
girl
having
an
unsuspicious
nature
and
a
tender
heart
believed
the
tale
of
woe
which
the
boy
unfolded
and
went
with
him
to
see
his
poor
mother
who
had
just
fallen
down
in
a
fit
and
was
dying
at
that
moment
for
want
of
physic
and
some
one
to
attend
to
her
she
suggested
indeed
that
the
slogger
should
run
to
the
nearest
chemist
but
the
slogger
said
it
would
be
of
no
use
and
might
be
too
late
would
she
just
run
round
an
see
her
the
girl
acted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
in
her
exuberant
sympathy
she
hurried
down
an
alley
round
a
corner
under
an
archway
and
walked
straight
into
the
lion
den
there
mr
brassey
the
lion
promptly
introduced
himself
and
requested
the
loan
of
her
purse
and
watch
the
poor
girl
at
once
understood
her
position
and
turned
to
fly
but
a
powerful
hand
on
her
arm
prevented
her
then
she
tried
to
shriek
but
a
powerful
hand
on
her
mouth
prevented
that
also
then
she
fainted
not
wishing
to
be
found
in
an
awkward
position
mr
brassey
and
the
slogger
searched
her
pockets
hastily
and
finding
nothing
therein
retired
precipitately
from
the
scene
taking
her
little
dog
with
them
as
they
did
so
the
young
girl
recovered
sprang
wildly
up
and
rushing
back
through
the
court
and
alley
dashed
into
the
main
thoroughfare
the
two
thieves
saw
her
attempt
to
cross
saw
a
knock
her
down
saw
a
crowd
rush
to
the
spot
and
then
saw
no
more
owing
to
pressing
engagements
requiring
their
immediate
presence
elsewhere
there
that
wot
the
slogger
told
me
said
little
slidder
with
flushed
cheeks
and
excited
looks
an
i
made
him
give
me
an
exact
description
o
the
gal
which
was
a
facsimilar
o
the
pictur
painted
miss
edie
willis
by
her
own
grandmother
as
like
as
two
black
cats
this
is
interesting
interesting
my
boy
said
i
stopping
and
looking
at
the
pavement
but
i
fear
that
it
leaves
us
no
clew
with
which
to
prosecute
the
search
of
course
it
do
rejoined
robin
with
one
of
his
knowing
looks
but
do
you
think
i
go
an
aggrawate
myself
about
the
thing
if
i
more
to
say
than
that
well
what
more
have
you
to
say
just
this
that
ever
since
my
talk
wi
the
slogger
i
bin
making
wery
partikler
inquiries
at
all
the
chemists
and
hospitals
round
about
where
he
said
the
accident
happened
an
i
diskivered
one
hospital
where
i
to
know
the
porter
an
i
got
him
to
inwestigate
an
he
found
there
was
a
case
of
a
young
gal
run
over
on
the
wery
day
this
happened
she
got
feverish
he
says
an
did
know
what
she
was
sayin
for
months
an
nobody
come
to
inquire
arter
her
an
when
she
began
to
git
well
she
sent
to
vitechapel
to
inquire
for
grandmother
but
grandmother
was
gone
nobody
knowed
where
then
the
young
gal
got
wuss
then
she
got
better
and
then
she
left
sayin
she
go
back
to
old
in
york
for
she
was
sure
the
old
lady
must
have
returned
there
so
the
reason
i
goin
to
recruit
my
in
the
north
d
see
but
before
i
go
would
it
be
better
that
you
should
make
some
inwestigations
at
the
hospital
i
heartily
agreed
to
this
and
went
without
delay
to
the
hospital
where
however
no
new
light
was
thrown
on
the
subject
on
the
contrary
i
found
what
slidder
had
neglected
to
ascertain
that
the
name
of
the
girl
in
question
was
edie
willis
but
eva
bright
a
circumstance
which
troubled
me
much
and
inclined
me
to
believe
that
we
had
got
on
a
false
scent
but
when
i
reflected
on
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
i
still
felt
hopeful
the
day
of
disappearance
tallied
exactly
with
the
date
of
the
robbing
of
the
girl
by
brassey
and
the
slogger
her
personal
appearance
too
as
described
by
the
slogger
corresponded
exactly
with
the
description
given
of
her
granddaughter
by
mrs
willis
and
above
all
the
sending
of
a
messenger
from
the
hospital
by
the
girl
to
inquire
for
her
grandmother
mrs
willis
were
proofs
too
strong
to
be
set
aside
by
the
mystery
of
the
name
in
these
circumstances
i
also
resolved
to
take
a
holiday
and
join
robin
slidder
in
his
trip
to
york
chapter
ten
a
disappointment
an
accident
and
a
perplexing
return
but
the
trip
to
york
produced
no
fruit
some
of
the
tradespeople
did
indeed
remember
old
mrs
willis
and
her
granddaughter
but
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
them
since
they
left
they
knew
very
little
about
them
personally
and
nothing
whatever
of
their
previous
history
as
they
had
stayed
only
a
short
time
in
the
town
and
had
been
remarkably
shy
and
uncommunicative
the
result
it
was
thought
of
their
having
come
down
in
life
much
disappointed
slidder
and
i
returned
to
london
it
is
fortunate
that
we
did
not
tell
granny
the
object
of
our
trip
so
that
she
will
be
spared
the
disappointment
that
we
have
met
with
said
i
as
the
train
neared
the
metropolis
my
companion
made
no
reply
he
had
evidently
taken
the
matter
much
to
heart
we
were
passing
rapidly
through
the
gradually
thickening
groups
of
streets
and
houses
which
besprinkle
the
circumference
of
the
great
city
and
sat
gazing
contemplatively
on
back
yards
chimney
cans
unfinished
suburban
residences
pieces
of
waste
ground
back
windows
internal
domestic
arrangements
etcetera
as
they
flew
past
in
rapid
succession
robin
said
i
breaking
silence
again
and
using
the
name
which
had
by
that
time
grown
familiar
have
you
made
up
your
mind
yet
about
taking
service
with
dr
mctougall
now
that
we
have
got
mrs
jones
engaged
and
paid
to
look
after
granny
she
will
be
able
to
get
on
pretty
well
without
you
and
you
shall
have
time
to
run
over
and
see
her
frequently
h
i
do
quite
see
my
way
returned
the
boy
with
a
solemn
look
you
see
sir
if
it
was
a
i
was
to
be
to
attend
on
young
lady
the
i
might
take
it
into
consideration
but
to
go
into
buttons
an
blue
merely
to
open
a
door
an
do
the
purlite
to
wisitors
an
mix
up
things
with
bad
smells
by
way
of
a
change
why
see
the
prospec
ai
temptin
besides
i
hate
blue
the
buttons
is
all
well
enough
but
blue
reminds
me
so
of
the
bobbies
that
i
do
think
i
could
surwive
it
long
indeed
i
do
robin
said
i
reproachfully
i
grieved
at
your
indifference
to
friendship
so
sir
have
you
not
mentioned
merely
your
objections
and
the
disadvantages
without
once
weighing
against
them
the
advantages
vich
is
which
are
said
i
being
under
the
same
roof
with
and
with
punch
to
say
nothing
of
your
young
lady
ah
to
be
sure
vell
but
i
did
think
of
all
that
only
do
you
see
i
come
to
be
under
the
same
roof
with
you
all
in
course
o
time
you
got
spliced
an
set
up
for
slidder
said
i
sternly
and
losing
patience
under
the
presumption
you
must
never
again
dare
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
you
know
very
well
that
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
and
and
get
into
a
careless
way
of
referring
to
such
a
possibility
among
servants
or
no
honour
bright
exclaimed
slidder
with
for
the
first
time
a
somewhat
abashed
look
in
his
face
i
would
for
the
wealth
of
the
injies
say
a
word
to
nobody
wotsomever
it
only
atween
ourselves
that
i
wentur
to
well
well
enough
said
i
do
in
future
venture
to
do
it
even
between
ourselves
if
you
care
to
retain
my
friendship
now
robin
i
added
as
the
train
slowed
of
course
you
not
let
a
hint
of
our
reason
for
going
north
pass
your
lips
to
poor
granny
or
any
one
and
give
her
the
old
message
that
i
be
along
to
see
her
soon
it
was
pleasant
to
return
to
such
a
hearty
reception
as
i
met
with
from
the
doctor
family
although
my
absence
had
been
but
for
a
few
days
the
children
came
crowding
and
clinging
round
me
declaring
that
it
seemed
like
weeks
since
i
left
them
the
doctor
himself
was
as
usual
exuberant
and
his
wife
extremely
kind
miss
blythe
i
found
had
not
yet
returned
and
was
not
expected
for
some
time
but
the
reception
accorded
me
by
the
doctor
and
his
family
was
as
nothing
to
the
wild
welcome
lavished
upon
me
by
dumps
that
loving
creature
came
more
nearly
to
the
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
before
his
spirit
was
obviously
much
too
large
for
his
body
he
was
romping
with
the
mctougall
baby
when
i
entered
the
instant
he
heard
my
voice
in
the
hall
he
uttered
a
squeal
almost
a
yell
of
delight
and
came
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
in
a
wriggling
heap
his
legs
taking
comparatively
little
part
in
the
movement
his
paws
when
first
applied
to
the
of
the
nursery
floor
slipped
as
if
on
ice
without
communicating
motion
on
the
stairs
his
ears
tail
head
hair
heart
and
tongue
conspired
to
convulse
him
only
when
he
had
fairly
reached
me
did
the
do
their
duty
as
he
bounced
and
wriggled
high
into
air
powers
of
description
are
futile
vision
alone
is
of
any
avail
in
such
a
case
are
dogs
mortal
is
such
overflowing
wealth
of
affection
extinguished
at
death
pshaw
thought
i
the
man
who
thinks
so
shows
that
he
is
utterly
void
of
the
merest
rudiments
of
common
sense
i
did
not
mention
the
object
of
my
visit
to
york
to
the
doctor
or
his
wife
indeed
that
natural
shyness
and
reticence
which
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
shake
off
except
when
writing
to
you
good
reader
would
in
any
case
have
prevented
my
communicating
much
of
my
private
affairs
to
them
but
particularly
in
a
case
like
this
which
seemed
to
be
assuming
the
aspect
of
a
wildly
romantic
hunt
after
a
lost
young
girl
more
like
the
plot
of
a
sensational
novel
than
an
occurrence
in
life
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
the
doctor
had
indeed
understood
from
mrs
willis
that
she
had
somehow
lost
a
granddaughter
but
being
rather
fussy
in
his
desires
and
efforts
to
comfort
people
in
distress
he
had
failed
to
rouse
the
sympathy
which
would
have
drawn
out
details
from
the
old
woman
i
therefore
merely
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
business
which
had
called
me
to
the
north
of
england
had
been
unsuccessful
and
then
changed
the
subject
meanwhile
dumps
returned
to
the
nursery
to
resume
the
game
of
romps
which
i
had
interrupted
after
a
general
scrimmage
in
which
the
five
chips
of
the
elder
mctougall
had
joined
without
regard
to
any
concerted
plan
dolly
suddenly
shouted
what
are
we
to
stop
for
demanded
harry
whose
powers
of
were
not
strong
want
a
said
dolly
sitting
down
on
a
stool
with
a
resolute
plump
rest
quick
then
and
let
go
on
again
said
harry
throwing
himself
into
a
small
chair
while
job
and
jenny
sprawled
on
an
ottoman
in
the
window
seeing
that
her
troops
appeared
to
be
exhausted
and
that
a
period
of
repose
had
set
in
the
tall
nurse
thought
this
a
fitting
opportunity
to
retire
for
a
short
recreative
talk
with
the
servants
in
the
kitchen
now
be
good
she
said
in
passing
out
and
do
poor
little
dumps
oh
no
chorused
the
five
while
with
faces
of
intense
and
real
solemnity
they
assured
nurse
that
they
would
not
hurt
dumps
for
the
world
we
be
dood
remarked
dolly
as
the
door
closed
and
she
really
meant
it
what
we
do
to
him
now
asked
harry
whose
patience
was
exhausted

jenny
thought
that

be
too
cruel
and
harry
said
it
would
be
too
tame
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
these
and
several
other
appalling
tortures
were
meant
to
be
really
attempted
as
job
afterwards
said
it
was
only
play

jack

was
considerably
in
advance
of
the
others
in
regard
to
education

turn
him
into
joan

what
joan

they
called
him
by
lilly
blythe
name
dumps
who
sat
in
a
confused
heap
in
a
corner
panting
seemed
regardless
of
the
fate
that
awaited
him
but
where
shall

find

said
harry
know
exclaimed
job
going
to
the
fireplace
and
seizing
the
lid
of
a
saucepan
which
stood
on
the
hearth
near
enough
to
the
tall
fender
to
be
within
reach
here
somethin
capital
a
breastplate
just
the
thing
cried
jack
seizing
it
and
whistling
to
dumps
and
here
a
helmet
said
harry
producing
a
toy
drum
with
the
heads
out
the
strong
contrast
between
my
doggie
conditions
of
grigginess
and
humiliation
has
already
been
referred
to
aware
that
something
unusual
was
pending
he
crawled
towards
jack
with
every
hair
trailing
in
lowly
submission
poor
joan
of
arc
might
have
had
a
happier
fate
if
she
had
been
influenced
by
a
similar
spirit
now
sir
stand
up
on
your
the
already
and
obedient
creature
obeyed
there
he
said
tying
the
lid
to
his
hairy
bosom
and
there
he
continued
thrusting
the
drum
on
his
meek
head
which
it
fitted
exactly
now
madame
joan
come
away
the
fagots
are
ready
with
harry
aid
and
to
the
ineffable
joy
of
jenny
job
and
dolly
the
little
dog
was
carefully
bound
to
the
leg
of
a
small
table
and
bits
of
broken
toys
of
which
there
were
heaps
were
piled
round
it
for
fagots
do
be
said
dolly
tenderly
oh
no
we
wo
be
cruel
said
jack
who
was
really
anxious
to
accomplish
the
whole
execution
without
giving
pain
to
the
victim
the
better
to
arrange
some
of
the
fastenings
he
clambered
on
the
table
dolly
always
anxious
to
observe
what
was
being
done
attempted
to
do
the
same
jenny
trying
to
prevent
her
pulled
at
her
skirts
and
among
them
they
pulled
the
table
over
on
themselves
it
fell
with
a
dire
crash
of
course
there
were
cries
and
shouts
from
the
children
but
these
were
overtopped
and
quickly
silenced
by
the
hideous
yellings
of
dumps
full
many
a
time
had
the
poor
dog
given
yelp
and
yell
in
that
nursery
when
accidentally
hurt
and
as
often
had
it
wagged
its
forgiving
tail
and
licked
the
patting
hands
of
sympathy
but
now
the
yells
were
loud
and
continuous
the
patting
hands
were
snapped
at
and
dumps
refused
to
be
comforted
his
piercing
cries
reached
my
study
i
sprang
and
dashed
into
the
nursery
where
the
eccentric
five
were
standing
in
a
group
with
looks
of
horror
in
their
ten
round
eyes
and
almost
equally
expressive
round
mouths
the
reason
was
soon
discovered
poor
dumps
had
got
a
broken
having
ascertained
the
fact
alleviated
the
pain
as
well
as
i
could
and
bandaged
the
limb
i
laid
my
doggie
tenderly
in
the
toy
bed
belonging
to
jenny
largest
doll
which
was
quickly
and
heartily
given
up
for
the
occasion
the
dispossessed
doll
being
callously
laid
on
a
shelf
in
the
meantime
it
was
really
quite
interesting
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
accident
on
the
five
they
wept
over
dumps
most
genuine
tears
they
begged
his
pardon
implored
his
forgiveness
in
the
most
earnest
tones
and
touching
terms
they
took
turn
about
in
watching
by
his
they
held
lint
and
lotion
with
superhuman
solemnity
while
i
dressed
his
wounded
limb
and
they
fed
him
with
the
most
tender
solicitude
in
short
they
came
out
quite
in
a
new
and
sympathetic
light
and
soon
began
to
play
at
with
each
other
this
involved
a
good
deal
of
pretended
sickness
and
for
a
long
time
after
that
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
visitors
to
the
nursery
to
find
three
of
the
five
down
with
measles
or
fever
while
the
fourth
acted
doctor
and
the
fifth
nurse
the
event
however
gave
them
a
lesson
in
gentleness
to
dumb
animals
which
they
never
afterwards
forgot
and
which
some
of
my
boy
readers
would
do
well
to
remember
with
a
laudable
effort
to
improve
the
occasion
mrs
mctougall
carefully
printed
in
huge
letters
and
elaborately
illuminated
the
sentence
be
kind
to
doggie
and
hung
it
up
in
the
nursery
thereupon
cardboard
pencils
paints
and
scissors
were
in
immediate
demand
and
soon
after
there
appeared
on
the
walls
in
hideously
bad
but
highly
ornamental
letters
the
words
be
kind
to
cattie
this
was
followed
by
be
kind
to
polly
which
instantly
suggested
be
kind
to
dolly
and
so
by
one
means
or
another
the
lesson
of
kindness
was
driven
home
soon
after
this
event
dr
mctougall
moved
into
a
new
house
in
the
same
street
i
became
regularly
established
as
his
partner
and
robin
slidder
entered
on
his
duties
as
page
in
buttons
it
is
right
to
observe
here
that
in
deference
to
his
prejudices
the
material
of
his
garments
was
not
blue
but
dark
grey
it
was
distinctly
arranged
however
that
robin
was
to
go
home
as
he
called
it
to
be
with
mrs
willis
at
nights
on
no
other
condition
would
he
agree
to
enter
the
doctor
service
and
i
found
on
talking
over
the
subject
with
mrs
willis
herself
that
she
had
become
so
fond
of
the
boy
that
it
would
have
been
sheer
cruelty
to
part
them
in
short
it
was
a
case
of
mutual
love
at
first
sight
no
two
individuals
seemed
more
unlikely
to
draw
together
than
the
meek
gentle
old
lady
and
the
dashing
boy
yet
so
it
was
my
dear
she
always
spoke
to
me
now
as
if
i
had
been
her
son
this
as
people
would
call
him
has
clearly
been
sent
to
me
as
a
comfort
in
the
midst
of
all
but
overwhelming
sorrow
and
i
believe
too
that
i
have
been
sent
to
draw
the
dear
boy
to
jesus
you
should
hear
what
long
and
pleasant
talks
we
have
about
him
and
the
bible
and
the
land
sometimes
indeed
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
granny
and
also
surprised
because
although
i
believe
the
boy
to
be
well
disposed
i
have
seldom
been
able
to
get
him
to
open
his
lips
to
me
on
religious
subjects
ah
but
he
opens
his
dear
lips
to
me
doctor
and
reads
to
me
many
a
long
chapter
out
of
the
blessed
word
reads
can
he
read
ay
can
he
not
so
badly
considering
that
i
only
began
to
teach
him
two
or
three
months
ago
but
he
knew
his
letters
when
we
began
and
could
spell
out
a
few
words
he
very
quick
you
see
and
a
dear
boy
soon
afterwards
we
made
this
arrangement
with
robin
more
convenient
for
all
parties
by
bringing
mrs
willis
over
to
a
better
lodging
in
one
of
the
small
back
streets
not
far
from
the
doctor
new
residence
i
now
began
to
devote
much
of
my
time
to
the
study
of
chemistry
not
only
because
it
suited
dr
mctougall
that
i
should
do
so
but
because
i
had
conceived
a
great
liking
for
that
science
and
entertained
some
thoughts
of
devoting
myself
to
it
almost
exclusively
in
the
various
experiments
connected
therewith
i
was
most
ably
and
i
may
add
delightedly
assisted
by
robin
slidder
i
was
also
greatly
amused
by
and
induced
to
philosophise
not
a
little
on
the
peculiar
cast
of
the
boy
mind
the
pleasure
obviously
afforded
to
him
by
the
uncertainty
as
to
results
in
experiments
was
very
great
the
probability
of
a
miscarriage
created
in
him
intense
interest
i
will
not
say
hope
the
ignorance
of
what
was
coming
kept
him
in
a
constant
flutter
of
subdued
excitement
and
the
astounding
results
even
sometimes
to
myself
of
some
of
my
combinations
kept
him
in
a
perpetual
simmer
of
expectation
but
after
long
observation
i
have
come
to
the
deliberate
conclusion
that
nothing
whatever
gave
robin
such
ineffable
joy
as
an
explosion
a
crash
a
burst
a
general
reduction
of
anything
to
instantaneous
and
elemental
ruin
was
so
dear
to
him
that
i
verily
believe
he
would
have
taken
his
chance
and
stood
by
if
i
had
proposed
to
blow
the
roof
off
dr
mctougall
mansion
nay
i
almost
think
that
if
that
remarkable
waif
had
been
set
on
a
bombshell
and
blown
to
atoms
he
would
have
retired
from
this
life
in
a
state
of
supreme
satisfaction
while
my
mind
was
thus
agreeably
concentrated
on
the
pursuit
of
science
it
received
a
rude
but
pleasing
yet
particularly
distracting
shock
by
the
return
of
lilly
blythe
the
extent
to
which
this
governess
was
worshipped
by
the
whole
household
was
wonderful
almost
idolatrous
need
i
say
that
i
joined
in
the
worship
and
that
dumps
and
robin
followed
suit
i
think
not
and
yet
there
was
something
strange
something
peculiar
something
unaccountable
about
miss
blythe
manner
which
i
could
by
no
means
understand
chapter
eleven
relates
generally
to
the
doings
and
sayings
of
robin
slidder
my
dear
said
mrs
mctougall
one
evening
to
the
doctor
since
that
little
boy
slidder
came
to
stay
with
us
things
have
become
worse
and
worse
in
fact
the
house
is
almost
unbearable
my
dear
responded
dr
mctougall
you
amaze
me
surely
the
boy
has
not
dared
to
be
rude
insolent
to
you
oh
no
it
not
that
but
he
must
really
be
forbidden
to
enter
the
nursery
our
darlings
you
know
were
dreadful
enough
before
he
came
but
since
then
they
have
become
absolute
maniacs
you
do
mean
to
say
that
the
little
rascal
has
been
teaching
them
bad
words
or
manners
i
hope
returned
the
doctor
with
a
frown
dear
me
no
papa
do
get
angry
answered
the
anxious
lady
far
from
it
on
the
contrary
i
really
believe
that
our
darlings
have
greatly
improved
his
language
and
manners
by
example
but
robin
exuberant
spirits
are
far
too
much
for
them
it
is
like
putting
fire
to
gunpowder
and
they
are
fond
of
him
that
the
difficulty
the
boy
does
not
presume
i
must
say
that
for
him
and
he
is
very
respectful
to
nurse
but
the
children
are
constantly
asking
him
to
come
and
play
with
them
which
he
seems
quite
pleased
to
do
and
then
his
mind
is
so
eccentric
so
inventive
the
new
games
he
devises
are
very
ingenious
but
so
exceedingly
dangerous
and
destructive
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
check
him
and
i
want
you
to
do
it
dear
i
must
know
something
about
the
nature
of
the
mischief
before
i
can
check
it
said
the
doctor
oh
it
indescribable
returned
the
lady
the
smell
that
he
makes
in
the
nursery
with
his
chemical
experiments
is
awful
and
then
poor
pompey
or
dumps
or
whatever
they
call
him
for
they
seem
very
undecided
about
his
name
has
not
the
life
of
i
was
going
to
say
a
dog
with
them
only
last
night
when
you
were
out
the
ridiculous
boy
proposed
the
storming
of
an
ogre
castle
nurse
was
at
the
time
or
it
could
never
have
happened
well
of
course
robin
was
the
ogre
darling
dolly
was
a
princess
whom
he
had
stolen
away
jack
was
a
prince
who
was
to
deliver
her
and
the
others
were
the
retainers
a
castle
was
built
in
one
corner
of
all
the
tables
and
chairs
in
the
room
piled
on
each
other
with
one
particular
chair
so
ingeniously
arranged
that
the
pulling
of
it
out
would
bring
the
castle
in
ruins
to
the
ground
the
plan
of
attack
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
was
that
the
prince
should
ring
our
at
the
castle
gates
and
fiercely
demand
admittance
the
demand
to
be
followed
by
a
burst
from
the
trumpets
drums
and
gongs
of
his
soldiers
the
ogre
seated
on
the
castle
top
with
the
princess
after
a
few
preliminary
yells
and
howls
was
to
say
in
a
gruff
voice
that
he
was
too
much
engaged
just
then
with
his
dinner
that
three
roast
babies
were
being
dished
when
they
were
disposed
of
the
princess
would
be
killed
and
served
up
as
a
sort
of
light
pudding
after
which
he
would
open
the
castle
gate
a
horrible
smell
was
to
be
created
at
this
point
to
represent
the
roasting
of
the
babies
this
was
to
be
the
signal
for
a
burst
of
indignation
from
the
prince
and
his
troops
who
were
to
make
a
furious
assault
on
the
door
one
of
our
largest
and
after
a
little
the
prince
was
to
pull
away
the
particular
chair
and
rush
back
with
his
men
to
avoid
the
falling
ruin
while
the
ogre
and
princess
were
to
find
shelter
under
the
nursery
table
and
then
when
the
fall
was
over
they
were
to
be
found
dead
among
the
ruins
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
princess
was
to
be
revived
or
she
was
to
have
a
grand
funeral
but
the
play
never
got
that
length
i
was
sitting
here
listening
to
the
various
sounds
overhead
wondering
what
they
could
be
about
when
i
heard
a
loud
ringing
that
was
the
castle
bell
it
was
soon
followed
by
a
burst
of
toy
trumpets
and
drums
a
most
disgusting
smell
began
to
permeate
the
house
at
the
same
time
for
it
seems
that
the
ogre
set
fire
to
his
chemicals
too
soon
then
i
heard
roaring
and
yelling
which
really
alarmed
me
it
was
so
gruff
when
it
stopped
there
was
a
woeful
howl
that
was
the
burst
of
indignation
the
assault
came
off
next
and
as
the
shouting
of
the
troops
was
mingled
with
the
hammering
of
the
large
the
ringing
of
the
and
the
beating
of
the
gong
you
may
fancy
what
the
noise
was
in
the
midst
of
it
there
was
a
hideous
crash
accompanied
by
screams
of
alarm
that
were
too
genuine
to
be
mistaken
i
rushed
up
and
found
the
furniture
lying
scattered
over
the
room
with
darling
dolly
in
the
midst
the
others
standing
in
solemn
silence
around
and
robin
slidder
sitting
on
the
ground
ruefully
rubbing
his
head
the
truth
was
that
the
particular
chair
had
been
pulled
away
before
the
proper
time
and
the
castle
had
come
down
in
ruins
while
the
ogre
and
princess
were
still
on
the
top
of
it
fortunately
robin
saved
dolly
at
the
expense
of
his
own
head
and
shoulder
by
throwing
his
arms
round
her
and
falling
undermost
but
it
was
a
narrow
escape
and
you
really
must
put
a
stop
to
such
reckless
ongoings
the
doctor
promised
to
do
so
i
have
to
send
robin
a
message
this
forenoon
and
will
administer
a
rebuke
before
sending
him
he
said
but
it
was
plain
from
the
smile
on
the
doctor
face
that
the
rebuke
would
not
be
severe
robin
he
said
with
much
solemnity
when
the
culprit
stood
before
him
take
this
bottle
of
medicine
to
mr
williams
you
know
the
old
place
and
say
i
want
to
know
how
he
is
and
that
i
will
call
afternoon
yes
sir
said
the
boy
taking
the
bottle
with
an
unusually
subdued
air
and
robin
stop
continued
the
doctor
i
am
told
that
the
children
were
visited
by
an
ogre
last
night
yes
sir
answered
the
boy
with
an
uncertain
glance
at
his
questioner
grave
face
well
robin
you
know
where
that
ogre
lives
just
call
and
tell
him
from
me
that
if
he
or
any
of
his
relations
ever
come
here
again
cause
them
to
undergo
extraction
of
the
spinal
marrow
understand
at
first
little
slidder
felt
inclined
to
laugh
but
the
doctor
face
was
so
unusually
stern
that
he
thought
better
of
it
and
went
away
much
impressed
now
robin
slidder
was
no
loiterer
on
his
errands
nevertheless
he
did
not
deem
it
a
breach
of
fidelity
to
cast
an
occasional
glance
into
a
window
or
to
pause
a
few
seconds
now
and
then
to
chaff
a
facetious
cabby
or
make
a
politely
sarcastic
remark
to
a
bobby
his
connection
with
what
he
termed
life
had
softened
him
down
considerably
and
given
a
certain
degree
of
polish
to
his
wit
but
it
had
in
no
degree
repressed
his
exuberant
spirits
the
distance
he
had
to
go
being
considerable
he
travelled
the
latter
part
of
the
way
by
omnibus
chancing
to
be
in
a
meditative
frame
of
mind
that
day
he
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
and
sat
down
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
deep
into
futurity
whether
he
saw
much
there
i
can
not
tell
but
after
wandering
for
some
time
in
that
unknown
region
his
eyes
returned
to
surrounding
things
and
among
other
objects
alighted
on
the
conductor
whose
head
was
within
a
few
inches
of
his
toe
it
was
the
head
of
the
slogger
that
eccentric
individual
having
sprung
up
in
a
few
months
from
the
condition
of
a
big
boy
to
that
of
an
exceedingly
young
man
had
obtained
a
situation
as
conductor
to
a
he
was
so
busy
with
his
fares
when
robin
mounted
the
that
he
failed
to
observe
him
until
the
moment
when
the
latter
returned
from
futurity
their
eyes
met
simultaneously
and
opened
to
such
an
extent
that
if
size
had
counted
for
numbers
they
might
have
done
for
four
boys
hallo
buttons
was
the
slogger
exclamation
hallo
slogger
was
that
of
robin
well
now
this
a
pleasure
who
a
thought
it
said
the
conductor
reaching
up
his
hand
is
that
for
your
fare
or
a
shake
slogger
demanded
robin
a
shake
of
course
old
feller
replied
the
other
as
robin
grasped
the
proffered
hand
but
i
say
he
added
in
a
lower
key
there
no
slogger
now
in
this
world
he
dead
an
buried
long
ago
my
name
is
villum
bowls
no
connection
wotever

into
the
genteel
line
eh
slidder

robin

my
name
villum

i
changed
it
since
we

last
though

united
an
a
pretty
pair
they

till

that
ancient
stout
party
shoved
in
looks
like
as
if
he
was
a
goin
in
the
opposite
direction
but
it
matter
so
long
as
we
can
get
now
then
sir
mind
the
step
all
right
i
say
slid
robin
i
mean
vell
slog
villum
i
mean
why
do
you
say
wot
you
mean
eh
like
grey
tights
an
buttons
said
the
slogger
with
a
bland
smile
so
so
replied
robin
with
a
careless
air
the
grey
is
sober
enough
quite
suitable
to
my
character
an
i
confess
i
fond
o
the
buttons
there
enough
of
to
form
a
goodish
overcoat
said
the
slogger
with
a
critical
grin
but
i
should
thought
not
sufficiently
waterproof
in
wet
weather
vell
they
ai
much
use
for
that
slog
eh
villum
but
you
should
see
the
dazzling
display
they
makes
in
sunshine
you
can
see
me
half
a
mile
off
i
chance
to
be
walking
in
regent
street
or
in
the
park
but
i
value
them
chiefly
because
of
the
frequent
and
pleasant
talks
they
get
me
with
the
ladies
you
do
mean
for
to
say
robin
that
the
ladies
ever
holds
you
by
the
no
i
do
but
i
holds
wi
the
buttons
this
is
the
way
of
it
i
chance
to
see
a
wery
pretty
lady
not
one
o
your
beauties
you
know
i
do
care
a
dump
for
them
creatures
but
one
your
sweet
amiable
sort
with
souls
above
buttons
an
faces
one
likes
to
look
at
and
to
kiss
you
a
right
to
vell
i
sees
one
these
i
brushes
up
again
an
on
with
my
buttons
to
some
of
togs
if
she
takes
it
ill
looks
cross
and
inclined
to
use
strong
language
i
makes
a
apology
an
gets
undone
as
fast
as
possible
but
if
she
larfs
and
says
boy
do
you
look
before
you
or
suthin
o
that
sort
i
just
on
another
tag
to
another
button
we
a
fumblin
at
the
first
one
and
so
goes
on
till
we
get
to
be
quite
sociable
over
it
i
might
almost
say
confidential
once
or
twice
i
been
the
victim
of
misjudgment
and
got
a
heavy
slap
on
the
face
from
angelic
hands
that
ought
to
known
better
but
on
the
i
willin
to
take
my
chance
not
a
bad
notion
remarked
the
slogger
especially
for
a
pretty
little
chap
like
you
robin
right
you
are
replied
the
other
but
you
need
try
on
the
dodge
yourself
for
it
would
never
pay
with
a
big
ugly
grampus
like
you
villum
having
thus
run
into
a
pleasant
little
chat
the
two
waifs
proceeded
to
compare
notes
in
the
course
of
which
comparison
the
slogger
gave
an
outline
of
his
recent
history
he
had
been
engaged
in
several
successful
burglaries
but
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
for
which
offence
he
had
spent
some
weeks
in
prison
while
there
a
visitor
had
spoken
to
him
very
earnestly
and
advised
him
to
try
an
honest
life
as
being
to
say
the
least
of
it
easier
work
than
thieving
he
had
made
the
attempt
through
the
influence
of
the
same
he
had
obtained
a
situation
from
which
he
had
been
advanced
to
the
responsible
position
which
he
then
held
and
know
robin
said
the
slogger
i
find
that
honesty
pays
pretty
well
and
i
means
to
stick
to
it
an
i
suppose
said
robin
if
it
did
pay
pretty
well
you
cut
it
of
course
i
would
returned
the
slogger
with
a
look
of
surprise
wot
the
use
o
stickin
to
a
thing
that
do
pay
vell
if
them
your
principles
you
ai
got
much
to
on
by
my
tulip
said
robin
an
wot
principles
may
on
by
my
turnip
asked
the
slogger
it
would
puzzle
me
rather
to
tell
that
returned
robin
talkin
down
to
the
level
of
my
own
toes
on
the
top
of
a
but
tell
you
what
villum
if
you
come
to
number
grovelly

the
slogger
with
a
slight
smile
of
contempt
and
publics

rejoined
the
slogger
not
so
sure
o
that
villum
there

deal
o
prayer
in
such
places
sometimes
an
it
well
for
the
wisitors
that

prayer
a
deal
more
and

young
missus

sunday
evening
to
young
fellers
like

me

judge

no
thankee
returned
the
slogger
as
he
spoke
a
lady
with
a
made
powerful
demonstrations
with
her
umbrella
the
stopped
and
the
conductor
attended
to
his
duties
while
robin
who
really
felt
a
strong
desire
to
bring
his
old
comrade
under
an
influence
which
he
knew
was
working
a
wonderful
change
in
himself
sat
meditating
sadly
on
the
obstinacy
of
human
nature
i
say
robin
said
the
slogger
on
resuming
his
perch
know
i
found
traces
o
that
young
gal
as
you
took
such
a
interest
in
as
runned
away
from
the
old
an
was
robbed
by
brassey
an
me
you
do
mean
that
exclaimed
robin
eagerly
yes
i
do
she
in
london
i
believe
but
i
ca
exactly
say
where
i
heard
of
her
through
sal
you
know
sal
who
out
at
the
vest
end
o
potter
lane
i
expect
to
see
sal
in
an
hour
so
if
comin
back
this
way
i
be
at
the
black
bull
by
two
and
tell
you
all
i
can
pump
out
of
i
be
there
sharp
said
robin
promptly
an
now
pull
up
for
i
must
take
to
my
legs
here
but
i
say
robin
if
we
do
find
that
gal
you
wo
split
on
me
eh
you
wo
tell
who
i
am
or
where
i
is
you
wo
wictimise
your
old
friend
take
me
for
a
informer
demanded
robin
with
an
offended
look
hall
right
cried
the
slogger
giving
the
signal
to
drive
on
robin
sped
quickly
away
executed
his
mission
and
returned
to
the
black
bull
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
and
strong
hope
slidder
was
doomed
to
disappointment
he
reached
the
black
bull
at
two
precisely
vell
my
fair
one
he
said
addressing
a
who
met
him
in
the
passage
it
good
for
sore
eyes
to
see
the
likes
o
you
in
cloudy
weather
to
know
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
sl
i
mean
villum
bowls
yes
i
do
mr
answered
the
girl
you
could
introdooce
me
to
him
could
you
miss
sunshine
no
i
could
because
he
is
here
and
wo
likely
be
back
for
two
hours
this
reply
took
all
the
humour
out
of
robin
tone
and
manner
he
resolved
however
to
wait
for
half
an
hour
and
went
out
to
saunter
in
front
of
the
hotel
half
an
hour
passed
then
another
then
another
and
the
boy
was
fain
to
leave
the
spot
in
despair
poor
slidder
temperament
was
sanguine
slight
encouragement
raised
his
hopes
very
high
failure
depressed
him
proportionally
and
woefully
low
but
to
do
him
justice
he
never
sorrowed
long
in
the
present
instance
he
left
the
black
bull
grinding
his
teeth
then
he
took
to
clanking
his
heels
as
he
walked
along
in
a
way
that
drew
forth
the
comments
of
several
to
whom
in
a
spirit
of
liberality
he
returned
considerably
more
than
he
received
then
he
began
to
mutter
between
his
teeth
his
private
opinion
as
to
faithless
persons
in
general
and
faithless
villum
the
slogger
in
particular
whose
character
he
painted
to
himself
in
extremely
sombre
colours
after
that
a
heavy
having
fallen
and
drenched
him
he
walked
recklessly
and
violently
through
every
puddle
in
his
path
this
seemed
to
relieve
his
spirit
for
when
he
reached
hoboy
crescent
he
had
recovered
much
of
his
wonted
equanimity
the
slogger
was
not
however
so
faithless
as
his
old
friend
imagined
he
had
been
at
the
black
bull
before
two
but
had
been
sent
off
by
his
employer
with
a
note
to
a
house
at
a
considerable
distance
in
such
urgent
haste
that
he
had
not
time
even
to
think
of
leaving
a
message
for
his
friend
in
these
circumstances
he
resolved
to
clear
his
character
by
paying
a
visit
on
the
following
sunday
to
number
grovelly
street
shadwell
square
chapter
twelve
begins
with
love
hope
and
joy
and
ends
peculiarly
it
may
not
perhaps
surprise
the
reader
to
learn
that
after
lilly
blythe
return
to
town
i
did
not
prosecute
my
studies
with
as
much
enthusiasm
as
before
in
fact
i
divided
my
attentions
pretty
equally
between
lilly
and
chemistry
now
i
am
not
prone
to
become
sentimentally
talkative
about
my
own
affairs
but
as
courtship
and
love
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
undoubted
and
important
elements
in
the
chemistry
of
human
affairs
and
as
they
influenced
me
and
those
around
me
to
some
extent
i
can
not
avoid
making
reference
to
them
but
i
promise
the
reader
to
do
so
only
as
far
as
appears
necessary
for
the
elucidation
of
my
story
first
then
although
i
knew
that
my
prospects
of
success
as
a
partner
of
dr
mctougall
were
most
encouraging
i
felt
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
think
of
marriage
until
my
position
was
well
established
and
my
income
adequate
i
therefore
strove
with
all
my
might
to
check
the
flow
of
my
thoughts
towards
miss
blythe
as
well
might
i
have
striven
to
restrain
the
flow
of
niagara
true
love
can
not
be
stemmed
in
my
case
however
the
proverb
was
utterly
falsified
for
my
true
love
run
smooth
more
than
that
it
ran
fast
very
fast
indeed
so
much
so
that
i
was
carried
as
it
were
on
the
summit
of
a
rushing
into
the
placid
harbour
of
engagement
the
anchorage
in
that
harbour
is
with
many
people
uncertain
with
lilly
and
me
it
was
not
so
the
was
good
it
had
caught
hold
of
a
rock
and
held
on
it
happened
thus
after
many
weeks
of
struggling
on
my
part
to
keep
out
of
miss
blythe
way
and
to
prevent
the
state
of
my
feelings
from
being
observed
by
her
struggles
which
i
afterwards
found
to
my
confusion
had
been
quite
obvious
to
her
i
found
myself
standing
alone
one
sunday
afternoon
in
the
doctor
meditating
on
the
joys
of
childhood
as
exemplified
by
thunderous
blows
on
the
floor
above
and
piercing
shouts
of
laughter
the
children
had
been
to
church
and
were
working
off
the
steam
accumulated
there
suddenly
there
was
a
dead
silence
which
i
knew
to
be
the
result
of
a
meal
the
meal
was
i
may
add
the
union
of
a
late
dinner
with
an
early
tea
it
was
characteristic
of
sundays
in
the
mctougall
nursery
the
thought
of
this
union
turned
my
mind
into
another
channel
just
then
miss
blythe
entered
she
looked
so
radiant
that
i
forgot
myself
forgot
my
former
struggles
my
good
resolutions
everything
except
herself
and
proposed
on
the
spot
i
was
rejected
of
course
more
than
that
i
was
stunned
hope
had
told
me
many
flattering
tales
indeed
i
had
felt
so
sure
from
many
little
symptoms
that
lilly
had
a
strong
regard
for
me
to
say
the
least
that
i
was
overwhelmed
not
only
by
my
rejection
but
by
the
thought
of
my
foolish
i
do
wonder
that
you
look
upon
me
as
a
presumptuous
vain
contemptible
fellow
said
i
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
but
i
do
not
regard
you
in
that
light
said
lilly
with
a
faint
smile
and
then
hesitatingly
she
looked
down
at
the
carpet
in
what
light
do
you
regard
me
miss
blythe
said
i
recovering
a
little
hope
and
speaking
vehemently
really
dr
mellon
you
take
me
by
surprise
your
manner
so
abrupt
so
oh
never
mind
manner
dear
miss
blythe
said
i
seizing
her
hand
and
forcibly
detaining
it
you
are
the
soul
of
truth
tell
me
is
there
any
hope
for
me
you
care
for
me
dr
mellon
she
said
drawing
her
hand
firmly
away
i
can
not
should
not
reply
you
do
not
know
all
the
the
circumstances
of
my
life
my
poverty
my
solitary
condition
in
the
world
my
my
miss
blythe
i
exclaimed
in
desperation
if
you
were
as
poor
as
a
a
church
rat
as
solitary
as
as
adam
before
the
advent
of
eve
i
would
count
it
my
chief
joy
and
hallo
mellon
hi
i
say
where
are
you
shouted
the
voice
of
the
doctor
at
that
moment
from
below
stairs
here
dumps
been
in
the
laboratory
and
capsized
some
of
the
chemicals
coming
sir
i
shouted
then
tenderly
though
hurriedly
to
miss
blythe
you
will
let
me
resume
this
subject
at
hallo
look
sharp
from
below
yes
yes
i
be
down
directly
dear
miss
blythe
if
you
only
knew
why
the
dog
burning
all
over
help
me
roared
the
doctor
miss
blythe
blushed
and
laughed
how
could
she
help
it
i
hastily
kissed
her
hand
and
fled
from
the
room
that
was
the
whole
affair
there
was
not
enough
strictly
speaking
to
form
a
ground
of
hope
but
somehow
i
knew
that
it
was
all
right
in
the
laboratory
i
found
dumps
smoking
and
the
doctor
pouring
water
from
the
tap
on
his
dishevelled
body
he
was
not
hurt
and
little
damage
was
done
but
as
i
sat
in
my
room
talking
to
him
that
evening
i
could
not
help
reproaching
him
with
having
been
the
means
of
breaking
off
one
of
the
most
important
interviews
of
my
life
however
dumps
i
continued
your
good
services
far
outweigh
your
wicked
deeds
and
whatever
you
may
do
in
the
future
i
will
never
forget
that
you
were
the
means
of
introducing
me
to
that
angel
lilly
blythe
the
angel
in
question
went
that
sunday
evening
at
seven
as
was
her
wont
to
a
bible
class
which
she
had
started
for
the
instruction
of
some
of
the
poor
neglected
boys
and
lads
who
idled
about
in
the
dreary
back
streets
of
our
aristocratic
neighbourhood
the
boys
had
become
so
fond
of
her
that
they
were
eager
to
attend
and
usually
assembled
round
the
door
of
the
before
the
hour
my
robin
slidder
was
of
course
one
of
her
warmest
adherents
he
was
standing
that
night
apart
from
the
other
boys
contemplating
the
proceedings
of
two
combative
sparrows
which
quarrelled
over
a
crumb
of
bread
on
the
pavement
and
had
just
come
to
the
conclusion
that
men
and
sparrows
had
some
qualities
in
common
when
he
was
attracted
by
a
low
whistle
and
looking
up
beheld
the
slogger
peeping
round
a
neighbouring
corner

robin
slidder
faithfully
and
earnestly
pledged
himself
while
he
was
speaking
there
was
a
general
movement
among
the
lads
and
boys
towards
the
for
miss
blythe
was
seen
coming
towards
them
the
two
friends
moved
with
the
rest
just
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
door
robin
missed
his
companion
and
looking
back
saw
him
bending
down
and
holding
his
sides
as
if
in
pain
wot
wrong
now
he
inquired
returning
to
him
oh
i
took
so
bad
said
the
slogger
looking
very
red
and
rubbing
himself
a
old
complaint
as
i
thought
i
was
cured
of
oh
dear
to
excuge

robin
i
go
an
take
a
turn

if

if

i
meet
you
round
the
corner
arter
it
over
so
saying
the
slogger
turning
round
walked
quickly
away
and
his
little
friend
entered
the
in
a
state
of
mind
pendulating
between
disgust
and
despair
for
he
had
no
expectation
of
seeing
the
slippery
slogger
again
that
night
when
the
meeting
was
over
miss
blythe
returned
home
i
saw
her
enter
the
library
no
one
else
was
there
i
knew
the
gas
had
not
yet
been
lighted
and
only
a
faint
flicker
from
the
fire
illumined
the
room
unable
to
bear
the
state
of
uncertainty
under
which
my
mind
still
laboured
i
resolved
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
or
quit
the
house
and
england
for
ever
i
spare
the
reader
the
details
suffice
it
to
say
that
after
much
entreaty
i
got
her
to
admit
that
she
loved
me
but
she
refused
to
accept
me
until
she
had
told
me
her
whole
history
then
i
sure
of
you
now
said
i
in
triumph
for
be
your
history
what
it
may
i
never
give
you
up
dearest
lilly
do
call
me
lilly
she
said
in
a
low
quiet
tone
it
is
only
a
pet
name
which
the
little
ones
here
gave
me
on
my
first
coming
to
them
call
me
edith
i
will
said
i
with
enthusiasm
a
far
more
beautiful
name
i
hallo
hi
mellon
are
you
there
for
the
second
time
that
day
dr
mctougall
interrupted
me
but
i
was
proof
against
annoyance
now
yes
i
am
here
i
shouted
running
downstairs
surely
dumps
is
not
burning
himself
again
eh
oh
no
returned
my
friend
with
a
laugh
only
a
telegram
however
it
important
enough
to
require
prompt
attention
the
gordons
in
bingley
manor
you
know
them
telegraph
me
to
run
down
immediately
old
lady
now
it
unfortunately
happens
that
i
have
an
engagement
this
evening
which
positively
can
not
be
put
off
so
i
must
send
you
besides
i
know
well
enough
what
it
is
they
easily
alarmed
and
convinced
it
is
just
the
old
story
however
the
summons
must
be
obeyed
you
will
go
for
me
the
train
starts
in
half
an
hour
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
catch
it
if
you
make
haste
you
have
to
stay
all
night
no
return
train
till
being
an
place
there
off
with
you
put
the
telegram
in
your
pocket
for
the
address
so
saying
the
doctor
put
on
his
hat
and
left
the
house
summoning
robin
slidder
i
bade
him
pack
a
few
things
into
my
while
i
wrote
a
note
when
he
had
finished
he
told
me
of
his
interview
with
the
slogger
i
was
greatly
interested
and
asked
if
he
had
gone
to
see
his
friend
after
the
meeting
no
sir
i
did
i
meant
to
but
miss
blythe
wanted
me
to
walk
with
it
was
so
dark
an
i
went
back
he
had
gone
pity
robin
a
great
pity
said
i
hastily
strapping
up
my
bag
but
no
doubt
he
come
here
again
to
see
now
do
forget
to
take
over
that
parcel
of
tea
and
sugar
etcetera
to
mrs
willis
go
as
soon
as
you
can
saying
this
i
left
the
house
the
new
residence
of
the
old
woman
being
now
so
near
to
hoboy
crescent
the
parcel
was
soon
delivered
and
robin
officiated
at
the
opening
of
it
also
at
the
preparing
and
consuming
of
some
of
its
contents
of
course
he
chatted
vigorously
as
was
his
wont
but
was
particularly
careful
to
make
not
the
most
distant
allusion
to
the
slogger
or
his
reports
being
anxious
not
to
arouse
her
hopes
until
he
should
have
some
evidence
that
they
were
on
a
true
scent
indeed
he
was
so
fearful
of
letting
slip
some
word
or
remark
on
the
subject
and
thereby
awakening
suspicion
and
giving
needless
pain
that
he
abstained
from
all
reference
to
the
meeting
of
that
evening
and
launched
out
instead
into
wonderful
and
puzzling
theological
speculations
of
which
he
was
very
fond
meanwhile
i
was
carried
swiftly
into
the
country
the
lamp
in
my
carriage
was
too
dim
to
permit
of
reading
i
therefore
wrapped
myself
in
my
rug
and
indulged
in
pleasant
meditations
it
was
past
midnight
when
i
arrived
at
the
station
for
bingley
manor
where
i
found
a
gig
awaiting
me
a
sharp
drive
of
half
an
hour
and
i
was
at
the
mansion
door
dr
mctougall
was
right
there
was
little
the
matter
with
old
mrs
gordon
but
the
family
were
nervous
and
rich
hence
my
visit
i
did
what
was
necessary
for
the
patient
comforted
the
rest
by
my
presence
had
a
sound
night
rest
an
early
breakfast
a
pleasant
drive
in
the
fresh
frosty
air
and
a
brief
wait
of
five
minutes
when
the
punctual
train
came
up
there
is
something
inexpressibly
delightful
in
a
ride
on
a
sharp
frosty
morning
in
an
express
train
i
have
always
felt
a
wild
bounding
sensation
of
joy
in
rapid
motion
the
pace
at
which
we
went
that
morning
was
exceptionally
charming
had
i
known
that
the
was
intoxicated
perhaps
it
might
not
have
been
quite
so
exhilarating
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
sat
comfortably
in
my
corner
thinking
of
edith
and
gazing
with
placid
benignity
at
the
frosted
trees
and
bushes
which
sparkled
in
the
red
wintry
sun
yes
it
was
a
glorious
ride
i
never
had
a
better
the
part
of
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
lovely
one
can
always
gaze
comfortably
at
the
landscape
from
a
railway
carriage
however
great
the
speed
as
for
the
immediate
foreground
it
reminded
me
of
a
race
houses
trees
farms
towns
villages
hamlets
horses
sheep
cattle
poultry
hayricks
brickfields
were
among
the
competitors
in
that
race
they
rushed
in
mad
confusion
to
the
rear
i
exulted
in
the
pace
not
so
a
stout
elderly
gentleman
in
the
opposite
corner
who
evidently
disliked
it
so
true
is
it
that
one
man
meat
is
poison
there
is
no
reason
to
fear
sir
said
i
with
a
smile
by
way
of
reassuring
him
this
is
a
most
excellently
managed
line
one
never
hears
of
accidents
on
it
too
fast
just
now
anyhow
returned
the
elderly
gentleman
testily
just
then
the
whistle
was
heard
sounding
violently
that
is
a
sign
of
safety
said
i
shows
that
they
are
on
the
alert
a
severe
application
of
the
brakes
caused
me
to
stop
abruptly
and
the
elderly
man
to
seize
the
arms
of
his
seat
with
a
convulsive
grasp
suddenly
there
was
a
mighty
crash
the
sensations
in
my
mind
that
followed
were
suggestive
of
cannons
rockets
bombs
fireworks
serpents
and
tumbling
then
all
was
dark
and
silent
as
the
grave
chapter
thirteen
a
wonderful
discovery
slowly
recovering
consciousness
i
found
myself
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
with
a
gentleman
bending
over
me
instantly
recollecting
what
had
occurred
i
endeavoured
to
start
up
but
was
obliged
to
fall
back
again
you
must
lie
quiet
sir
said
the
gentleman
you
not
much
hurt
we
will
send
you
on
if
you
choose
by
the
train
that
is
expected
in
a
few
minutes
is
the
elderly
gentleman
safe
i
asked
eagerly
which
elderly
gentleman
there
were
several
in
the
train
but
none
are
injured
i
believe
though
some
are
much
shaken
nobody
has
been
killed
it
has
been
quite
a
miraculous
escape
merciful
call
it
merciful
my
dear
sir
said
i
looking
upwards
and
thanking
god
with
all
my
heart
for
sparing
my
life
two
days
after
that
i
lay
on
the
sofa
in
hoboy
crescent
mr
and
mrs
mctougall
had
gone
out
so
had
the
children
the
forenoon
being
fine
edith
had
remained
at
home
for
reasons
which
she
did
not
see
fit
to
divulge
she
sat
beside
me
with
one
of
her
hands
in
mine
it
was
all
arranged
between
us
by
that
time
edith
said
i
after
a
short
pause
in
our
conversation
i
have
long
wanted
to
tell
you
about
a
dear
little
old
lady
with
whom
robin
slidder
and
i
have
had
much
to
do
she
one
of
my
poor
patients
whom
i
have
not
mentioned
to
you
before
but
i
heard
something
about
her
lately
which
makes
me
wish
to
ask
your
advice
perhaps
your
aid
in
a
rather
curious
search
which
i
been
engaged
in
for
a
long
time
past
i
will
go
for
my
work
john
and
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
it
she
replied
rising
i
shall
be
five
or
ten
minutes
in
preparing
it
can
you
wait
patiently
well
i
try
though
of
course
it
will
be
like
a
separation
of
five
or
ten
years
but
dumps
and
i
will
solace
each
other
in
your
by
the
way
touch
the
bell
as
you
pass
i
should
like
to
see
robin
not
having
had
a
talk
with
him
since
the
accident
when
robin
appeared
i
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
the
slogger
no
sir
i
replied
robin
with
a
somewhat
cross
look
that
there
slogger
has
played
me
false
these
two
times
leastwise
though
he
could
it
the
fust
time
he
got
to
clear
about
the
second
you
know
where
the
slogger
lives
do
you
i
asked
oh
yes
but
it
a
long
long
way
off
an
i
durst
go
without
leave
an
since
you
was
blowed
up
i
the
train
i
scarce
a
word
with
the
doctor
he
bin
that
busy
through
your
patients
on
as
well
as
is
own
well
robin
i
give
you
leave
to
go
be
off
within
this
very
hour
and
see
that
you
bring
me
back
some
good
news
now
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
the
poor
girl
is
in
london
perhaps
near
us
i
can
not
rest
until
we
find
her
or
prove
the
scent
to
have
been
a
false
one
away
with
you
as
the
boy
went
out
edith
came
back
with
her
work
basket
i
been
thinking
said
i
as
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
beside
me
that
before
beginning
my
story
it
would
be
well
that
you
should
unburden
your
dear
little
heart
of
that
family
secret
of
yours
which
you
thought
at
first
was
a
sufficient
bar
to
our
union
but
before
you
begin
let
me
solemnly
assure
you
that
your
revelations
whatever
they
are
will
utterly
fail
to
move
me
though
you
should
declare
yourself
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
thief
a
costermonger
or
a
chimpanzee
monkey
though
you
should
profess
yourself
to
have
been
a
charwoman
a
foundling
a
billingsgate
or
a
female
mountebank
my
feelings
and
resolves
will
remain
the
same
sufficient
for
me
to
know
that
you
are
and
that
you
are
there
go
on
truly
then
if
such
be
your
feelings
there
is
no
need
of
my
going
on
or
even
beginning
she
replied
with
a
smile
and
yet
with
a
touch
of
sadness
in
her
tone
which
made
me
grasp
her
hand
ah
edith
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
by
my
jesting
and
yet
the
spirit
of
what
i
say
is
true
absolutely
true
you
did
not
hurt
me
john
you
merely
brought
to
my
remembrance
my
great
sorrow
and
your
great
sorrow
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
gazing
at
her
smooth
young
face
yes
my
great
sorrow
and
i
was
going
to
add
my
loss
but
you
shall
hear
i
have
no
family
mystery
to
unfold
all
that
i
wished
you
to
know
on
that
head
was
that
i
am
without
family
altogether
all
are
dead
i
have
no
relation
on
earth
not
one
she
said
this
with
such
deep
pathos
while
tears
filled
her
eyes
that
i
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
of
comfort
to
save
my
life
and
she
continued
i
am
absolutely
penniless
these
two
points
at
first
made
me
repel
you
at
least
until
i
had
explained
them
to
you
now
that
you
look
upon
them
as
such
trifles
i
need
say
no
more
but
the
loss
to
which
i
have
referred
is
i
fear
irreparable
you
wo
think
me
selfish
or
tiresome
if
i
go
back
to
an
early
period
of
my
history
selfish
tiresome
i
repeated
oh
edith
well
then
many
years
ago
my
father
and
mother
lived
by
the
seashore
not
far
from
yarmouth
they
were
poor
my
father
gave
lessons
in
french
my
mother
taught
music
but
they
earned
sufficient
to
support
themselves
and
my
grandmother
and
me
in
comfort
we
were
a
happy
family
for
we
all
loved
god
and
tried
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
jesus
i
gave
them
indeed
a
great
deal
of
trouble
at
first
but
he
overcame
my
stubborn
heart
at
last
and
then
there
was
nothing
to
mar
the
happiness
of
our
lives
but
sickness
came
my
father
died
my
mother
tried
to
struggle
on
for
a
time
but
could
not
earn
enough
i
tried
to
help
her
by
teaching
but
had
myself
need
of
being
taught
at
last
we
changed
our
residence
in
hopes
of
getting
more
remunerative
employment
but
in
this
we
failed
then
my
mother
fell
sick
and
died
she
stopped
at
this
point
oh
edith
this
makes
you
doubly
dear
said
i
drawing
her
nearer
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
she
continued
being
left
alone
now
with
my
grandmother
i
resolved
to
go
to
london
and
try
to
find
employment
in
the
great
city
we
had
not
been
long
here
and
i
had
not
yet
obtained
employment
when
an
extraordinary
event
occurred
which
has
ever
since
embittered
my
life
i
went
out
for
a
walk
one
day
and
was
robbed
how
strange
i
exclaimed
half
rising
from
the
sofa
what
a
curious
coincidence
what
how
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
looking
at
me
in
surprise
never
mind
just
now
when
i
come
to
tell
you
story
you
will
understand
there
is
a
robbery
of
a
young
girl
in
it
go
well
then
as
i
said
i
was
robbed
by
a
man
and
a
boy
i
had
dear
little
pompey
with
me
at
the
time
and
that
is
the
way
i
came
to
lose
him
but
the
terrible
thing
was
that
an
accident
befell
me
just
after
i
was
robbed
and
i
never
saw
my
darling
grandmother
again
coincidence
i
exclaimed
starting
up
as
a
sudden
thought
was
forced
upon
my
mind
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
this
is
than
a
coincidence
and
yet
it
can
not
be
pooh
impossible
ridiculous
my
mind
is
wandering
i
sank
back
somewhat
exhausted
for
i
had
been
considerably
weakened
by
my
accident
edith
was
greatly
alarmed
at
my
words
and
looks
and
blamed
herself
for
having
talked
too
much
to
me
in
my
comparatively
weak
condition
no
you
have
not
talked
too
much
to
me
you
can
not
do
that
dear
i
said
it
was
now
her
turn
to
look
bewildered
she
echoed
why
why
do
you
call
me
edie
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hand
that
she
might
not
see
their
expression
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
thought
but
why
that
name
of
blythe
then
aloud
it
is
a
pretty
contraction
for
edith
is
it
not
do
you
like
it
like
it
yes
oh
how
much
but
but
well
edie
i
said
laying
powerful
restraint
on
myself
and
looking
her
calmly
in
the
face
you
must
bear
with
me
you
know
that
weakness
sometimes
causes
men
to
act
unaccountably
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you
i
wo
do
it
again
as
the
naughty
boys
go
on
dear
with
your
story
i
once
more
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hand
as
if
to
shade
them
from
the
light
and
listened
though
i
could
scarcely
conceal
my
agitation
the
name
of
edie
she
continued
is
that
by
which
my
darling
granny
always
called
me
and
it
sounded
so
familiar
yet
so
strange
coming
from
your
lips
but
after
all
it
is
a
natural
abbreviation
well
as
i
said
an
accident
befell
me
i
had
burst
away
from
the
thieves
in
a
state
of
wild
horror
and
was
attempting
to
rush
across
a
crowded
thoroughfare
when
a
cab
knocked
me
down
i
felt
a
sharp
pang
of
pain
heard
a
loud
shout
and
then
all
was
dark
on
recovering
i
found
myself
lying
in
one
of
the
beds
of
a
hospital
my
had
been
broken
and
i
was
very
feverish
scarcely
understood
where
i
was
and
felt
a
dull
sense
of
oppression
on
my
brain
they
spoke
to
me
and
asked
my
name
i
do
remember
distinctly
how
i
pronounced
it
but
i
recollect
being
somewhat
amused
at
their
misunderstanding
what
i
said
and
calling
me
miss
eva
bright
i
felt
too
ill
to
correct
them
at
the
time
and
afterwards
became
so
accustomed
to
eva
for
i
was
a
very
long
time
there
that
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
correct
the
mistake
this
was
very
foolish
and
unfortunate
for
long
afterwards
when
i
began
to
get
well
enough
to
think
coherently
and
sent
them
to
let
granny
know
where
i
was
they
of
course
went
with
the
name
of
eva
bright
it
was
very
stupid
no
doubt
but
i
was
so
weak
and
listless
after
my
long
and
severe
illness
that
this
never
once
occurred
to
me
as
it
turned
out
however
there
would
have
been
no
difference
in
the
result
for
my
darling
had
left
her
lodging
and
gone
no
one
knew
where
this
terrible
news
brought
on
a
relapse
and
for
many
weeks
i
believe
my
life
hung
on
a
thread
but
that
thread
was
in
the
hand
of
god
and
i
had
no
fear
what
is
the
name
edie
of
the
grandmother
you
have
lost
i
asked
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
willis
but
why
do
you
start
so
now
i
am
quite
you
have
been
more
severely
hurt
than
you
imagine
and
that
my
talking
so
much
is
not
good
for
you
no
edie
no
go
on
i
said
firmly
i
have
little
more
to
tell
she
continued
dear
dr
mctougall
had
attended
me
in
the
hospital
and
took
a
fancy
to
me
when
i
was
well
enough
to
leave
he
took
me
home
to
be
governess
to
his
children
but
my
situation
has
been
an
absolute
sinecure
as
yet
for
he
says
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
work
and
wo
let
me
do
anything
it
was
not
till
after
i
had
left
the
hospital
that
i
told
my
kind
friend
the
mistake
that
had
been
made
about
my
name
and
about
my
lost
grandmother
he
has
been
very
kind
about
that
and
assisted
me
greatly
at
first
in
my
search
for
her
but
there
are
so
many
so
many
people
of
the
name
of
willis
in
london
old
ladies
too
we
called
together
on
so
many
that
he
got
tired
of
it
at
last
of
course
i
wrote
to
various
people
at
york
and
to
the
place
where
we
had
lived
before
going
there
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
now
my
hopes
have
long
ago
died
out
that
is
to
say
almost
but
i
still
continue
to
make
inquiries
she
paused
here
for
some
time
and
i
did
not
move
or
speak
being
so
stunned
by
my
discovery
that
i
knew
not
what
to
say
and
feared
to
reveal
the
truth
to
edith
too
suddenly
then
i
knew
by
the
gentle
way
in
which
she
moved
that
she
thought
i
had
fallen
asleep
i
was
glad
of
this
and
remained
quietly
thinking
there
was
no
doubt
now
in
my
mind
that
edie
blythe
was
this
lost
granddaughter
of
old
mrs
willis
but
the
name
still
remained
an
insoluble
mystery
edie
said
i
abruptly
your
name
blythe
of
course
it
is
she
said
in
startled
surprise
why
should
you
doubt
it
i
doubt
it
said
i
but
i
sorely
puzzled
why
is
it
not
willis
why
exclaimed
edie
with
a
little
laugh
because
i
am
the
daughter
of
granny
willis
daughter
not
of
her
son
my
father
name
was
blythe
the
simplicity
of
this
explanation
and
my
gross
stupidity
in
quietly
assuming
from
the
beginning
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
lost
name
was
the
same
as
her
grandmother
burst
upon
me
in
its
full
force
the
delusion
had
been
naturally
perpetuated
by
mrs
willis
never
speaking
of
her
lost
darling
except
by
her
christian
name
for
a
few
seconds
i
was
silent
then
i
exploded
in
almost
an
hysterical
fit
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
i
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
my
doggie
who
had
returned
from
a
walk
with
robin
and
began
to
gambol
round
his
mistress
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
for
years
oh
sir
i
say
i
diskivered
all
about
little
slidder
had
rushed
excitedly
into
the
room
but
stopped
abruptly
on
observing
miss
blythe
who
was
looking
from
him
to
me
with
intense
surprise
before
another
word
could
be
said
a
servant
entered
please
miss
blythe
doctor
mctougall
wishes
to
see
you
in
his
study
she
left
us
at
once
now
robin
said
i
with
emphasis
sit
down
on
that
chair
opposite
me
and
let
hear
all
about
it
the
excited
boy
obeyed
and
dumps
leaping
on
another
chair
beside
him
sat
down
to
listen
with
ears
erect
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
oh
sir
you
never
such
a
go
began
robin
rubbing
his
hands
together
slowly
as
he
spoke
the
slogger
he
twigged
at
once
you
open
your
eyes
so
wide
that
you
never
git
shut
again
you
hears
no
i
never
see
such
a
lark
edie
found
i
seen
her
she
ai
the
queen
oh
no
nor
yet
one
o
the
queen
darters
by
no
means
nor
yet
a
duchess
oh
dear
no
though
she
like
one
who
d
think
she
is
but
you
never
guess
i
try
said
i
with
a
quiet
smile
for
i
had
subdued
myself
by
that
time
try
away
then
who
miss
edith
blythe
on
hearing
this
little
slidder
eyes
began
to
open
and
glisten
till
they
outshone
his
own
buttons
why
how
ever
did
you
come
to
guess
it
gasped
the
boy
on
recovering
himself
i
did
not
guess
it
i
found
it
out
do
you
suppose
that
nobody
can
find
out
things
except
sloggers
and
pages
in
buttons
oh
sir
tell
entreated
the
boy
i
did
tell
and
after
we
had
each
told
all
that
we
knew
we
mentally
hugged
ourselves
and
grew
so
facetious
over
it
that
we
began
to
address
dumps
personally
to
that
intelligent
creature
intense
satisfaction
now
robin
said
i
we
must
break
this
cautiously
to
the
old
lady
and
miss
blythe
oh
in
course
cautiously
assented
the
urchin
with
inconceivable
earnestness
well
then
off
you
go
and
fetch
my
greatcoat
we
go
visit
mrs
willis
at
once
at
vunce
echoed
robin
as
he
ran
out
of
the
room
with
blazing
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
lilly
said
dr
mctougall
as
edith
entered
his
just
off
to
see
a
patient
who
is
very
ill
and
there
is
another
who
is
not
quite
so
ill
but
who
also
wants
to
see
me
i
send
you
to
the
latter
as
my
female
assistant
if
you
will
go
her
complaint
is
chiefly
mental
in
fact
she
needs
comfort
more
than
physic
and
i
know
of
no
one
who
is
comparable
to
you
in
that
line
can
you
go
certainly
with
pleasure
i
go
at
once
her
name
said
the
doctor
is
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
of
your
loss
dear
girl
he
continued
in
a
lower
tone
as
he
gently
took
her
hand
but
i
would
not
again
arouse
your
hopes
you
know
how
many
old
women
of
this
name
we
have
seen
without
finding
her
yes
i
know
too
well
returned
poor
edith
while
the
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
i
have
long
ago
given
up
all
hope
but
notwithstanding
her
statement
edith
had
not
quite
given
way
to
despair
in
spite
of
herself
her
heart
fluttered
a
little
as
she
sped
on
this
mission
to
the
abode
of
old
mrs
willis
chapter
fourteen
the
last
when
robin
and
i
reached
the
abode
of
our
old
friend
in
a
state
let
me
add
of
almost
irrepressible
excitement
we
found
her
seated
in
the
old
by
the
window
gazing
sadly
out
on
the
prospect
it
was
not
now
the
prospect
of
red
brick
and
with
a
remote
distance
of
chimney
cans
and
cats
which
had
crushed
the
old
spirit
in
other
days
by
no
means
there
was
a
picturesque
little
court
with
an
old
pump
in
the
centre
to
awaken
the
fancy
and
frequent
visits
from
more
or
less
diabolical
to
excite
the
imagination
beyond
that
there
was
the
mews
in
which
a
lively
scene
of
variance
between
horses
and
men
was
enacted
from
morning
till
night
a
scene
which
derived
much
additional
charm
from
the
fact
that
mrs
willis
being
formed
fearfully
incorrect
estimates
of
men
and
beasts
and
things
in
general
well
granny
how
are
you
said
i
seating
myself
on
a
stool
beside
her
and
thinking
how
i
should
begin
pretty
griggy
eh
inquired
little
slidder
ah
there
you
are
my
dear
boys
said
the
old
lady
who
had
latterly
got
to
look
upon
me
and
my
as
brothers
you
are
always
sure
to
come
whoever
fails
me
has
any
one
failed
you
granny
i
asked
yes
dr
mctougall
has
she
replied
as
petulantly
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
speak
i
been
feeling
very
low
and
weak
and
sent
for
him
but
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
only
imagination
well
well
perhaps
it
is
she
added
after
a
pause
and
with
a
little
sigh
very
foolish
no
doubt
no
granny
said
i
you
not
foolish
contrariwise
wery
much
the
reverse
interrupted
slidder
and
i
glad
that
i
chanced
to
come
in
because
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
prescribe
for
you
as
well
as
he
better
dear
boy
better
that
it
cheer
up
from
slidder
and
it
always
does
me
a
world
of
good
to
see
your
handsome
face
well
granny
said
i
with
a
flutter
at
my
heart
as
i
looked
up
at
her
thin
careworn
face
and
began
to
break
the
ice
with
caution
come
i
there
a
little
piece
of
of
now
then
dig
in
the
spurs
doctor
an
go
at
it
neck
or
nuffin
murmured
my
impatient
companion
what
are
you
saying
robin
asked
mrs
willis
with
a
slightly
anxious
look
there
nothing
wrong
i
hope
no
no
nothing
wrong
granny
said
i
hastening
to
the
point
very
much
the
reverse
but
but
you
heard
of
my
accident
of
course
i
said
suddenly
losing
heart
and
beating
about
the
bush
stuck
again
murmured
slidder
in
a
tone
of
disgust
yes
yes
i
heard
of
it
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
getting
worse
said
the
old
lady
with
increasing
anxiety
oh
no
i
better
much
better
indeed
i
do
think
i
ever
felt
so
well
in
my
life
and
i
just
heard
a
piece
of
good
news
which
quite
sure
will
make
you
very
glad
very
glad
indeed
go
it
sir
another
burst
like
that
and
you
be
clear
out
o
the
wood
murmured
slidder
in
fact
said
i
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
i
going
to
be
married
whew
you
never
told
that
exclaimed
slidder
with
widening
eyes
you
be
quiet
robin
said
i
rather
sternly
how
can
i
get
over
this
very
difficult
matter
if
you
go
on
interrupting
me
so
mum
the
word
returned
the
boy
folding
his
hands
and
assuming
a
look
of
ridiculous
solemnity
at
that
moment
we
heard
a
noise
of
pattering
feet
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
which
had
not
been
properly
closed
burst
open
and
my
doggie
came
into
the
room
all
of
a
heap
after
a
brief
moment
lost
in
apparently
searching
for
his
he
began
to
dance
and
frisk
about
the
room
as
if
all
his
limbs
were
whalebone
and
his
spirit
quicksilver
oh
there
that
dog
again
put
it
out
put
it
out
cried
mrs
willis
gathering
her
old
skirts
around
her
feet
get
out
dumps
how
dare
you
come
here
sir
without
leave
gave
him
leave
said
a
sweet
voice
in
the
passage
next
moment
a
sweeter
face
was
smiling
upon
me
as
edith
entered
the
room
there
was
a
feeble
cry
at
the
window
i
observed
that
the
sweet
smile
vanished
and
a
deadly
pallor
overspread
edith
face
while
her
eyes
gazed
with
eager
surprise
at
the
old
lady
for
a
few
seconds
mrs
willis
sat
with
answering
gaze
and
outstretched
arms
edie
granny
was
all
that
either
could
gasp
but
there
was
no
need
for
more
the
lost
ones
were
mutually
found
with
an
indescribable
cry
of
joy
edith
sprang
forward
fell
on
her
knees
and
enfolded
granny
in
her
arms
you
are
doctor
whispered
robin
touching
me
on
the
elbow
and
presenting
a
tumbler
of
water
how
what
she
need
it
doctor
i
knows
her
well
an
it
the
thing
as
does
her
good
she
took
bad
slidder
was
right
the
shock
of
joy
was
almost
too
much
for
the
old
lady
she
leaned
heavily
on
her
granddaughter
neck
and
if
i
had
not
caught
her
both
must
have
fallen
to
the
ground
we
lifted
her
gently
into
bed
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
recovered
for
some
time
she
lay
perfectly
still
edith
reclining
on
the
lowly
couch
rested
her
fair
young
cheek
on
the
withered
old
one
presently
mrs
willis
moved
and
edith
sat
up
john
said
the
former
to
me
looking
at
the
latter
this
is
my
edie
thanks
be
to
the
lord
yes
granny
i
know
it
and
she
my
edie
too
a
surprised
and
troubled
look
came
on
her
old
face
she
evidently
was
pained
to
think
that
i
could
jest
at
such
a
moment
i
hastened
to
relieve
her
it
is
the
plain
and
happy
truth
that
i
tell
you
granny
edith
is
engaged
to
marry
is
it
not
so
i
turned
towards
the
dear
girl
who
silently
put
one
of
her
hands
in
mine
old
mrs
willis
spoke
no
word
but
i
could
see
that
her
soul
was
full
of
joy
i
chanced
to
glance
at
robin
and
observed
that
that
waif
had
retired
to
the
window
and
was
absolutely
wiping
his
eyes
while
dumps
sat
observant
in
the
middle
of
the
room
evidently
much
surprised
at
but
not
much
pleased
with
the
sudden
calm
which
had
succeeded
the
outburst
come
robin
said
i
rising
i
think
that
you
and
i
will
leave
them
granny
and
edie
i
shall
soon
see
you
again
i
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
come
dumps
come
my
doggie
wagged
his
scrumpy
tail
cocked
his
expressive
ears
and
glanced
from
me
to
his
mistress
but
did
not
rise
pompey
prefers
to
remain
with
me
said
edie
let
him
stay
punch
is
a
wise
dog
observed
robin
as
we
descended
the
stairs
together
but
you
do
ought
to
let
your
spirits
go
down
sir
he
added
with
a
profoundly
sagacious
glance
of
course
he
now
he
to
stick
to
you
wotever
an
to
me
too
i
understood
the
meaning
of
his
last
words
and
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
presumptuous
certainty
with
which
he
assumed
that
he
was
going
to
follow
my
fortunes
is
it
needful
to
say
that
when
i
mentioned
what
had
occurred
to
dr
mctougall
that
amiable
little
man
opened
his
eyes
to
their
widest
you
young
dog
he
exclaimed
was
it
grateful
in
you
to
repay
all
my
kindness
by
robbing
me
in
this
sly
manner
of
my
governess
nay
i
may
say
of
my
daughter
for
i
have
long
ago
considered
her
such
and
adopted
her
in
my
heart
it
was
not
done
slily
i
assure
you
said
i
indeed
i
fought
against
the
catastrophe
with
all
my
might
but
i
i
could
not
help
it
at
last
it
came
upon
me
as
it
were
unexpectedly
took
me
by
surprise
humph
ejaculated
the
doctor
besides
i
added
you
can
scarcely
call
it
robbery
for
are
not
you
and
i
united
as
partners
so
that
instead
of
robbing
you
i
have
in
reality
created
another
bond
of
union
between
you
and
edie
h
said
the
doctor
moreover
i
continued
it
happens
most
opportunely
just
now
that
the
house
opposite
this
one
is
to
let
it
is
a
much
smaller
and
house
than
this
and
admirably
suited
for
a
very
small
family
so
that
if
i
secure
it
we
will
scarcely
i
may
say
have
to
quit
your
roof
ah
to
be
sure
returned
the
doctor
falling
in
with
my
humour
we
will
have
the
pleasure
of
overlooking
and
criticising
each
other
and
our
respective
households
we
may
sit
at
the
windows
and
converse
across
the
street
in
fine
weather
or
flatten
our
noses
on
the
glass
and
make
faces
at
each
other
when
the
weather
is
bad
besides
we
can
have
a
tunnel
cut
under
the
street
and
thus
have
subterranean
communication
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
and
what
a
charming
place
that
would
be
for
the
children
to
romp
in
of
course
we
would
require
to
have
it
made
of
bricks
or
to
prevent
the
rats
connecting
it
with
the
sewers
but
a
breeze
of
pattering
feet
overhead
induced
the
doctor
to
pause
it
increased
to
a
gale
on
the
staircase
to
a
tempest
in
the
lobby
the
door
was
burst
open
and
jack
and
harry
and
job
and
jenny
and
dolly
with
blazing
cheeks
and
eyes
tumbled
tumultuously
into
the
room
oh
papa
screamed
harry
lilly
been
out
an
found
her
mother
no
it
not
it
her
shrieked
dolly
yes
an
dr
mellon
going
to
marry
her
cried
jenny
who
the
grandmother
asked
the
doctor
with
a
surprised
look
no
lilly
they
all
cried
with
a
shout
of
laughter
which
jack
checked
by
stoutly
asserting
that
it
was
her
that
lilly
had
found
this
drew
an
emphatic
no
it
not
from
job
and
a
firmly
reiterated
assertion
that
it
was
only
her
from
dolly
but
robin
said
so
cried
jack
no
he
said
job
yes
he
cried
harry
robin
said
she
found
said
dolly
i
go
an
ask
him
cried
jenny
and
turning
round
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
the
others
faced
about
as
one
child
and
the
tempest
swept
back
into
the
lobby
moderated
to
a
gale
on
the
staircase
and
was
reduced
to
a
breeze
afterwards
to
a
temporary
calm
overhead
before
it
burst
forth
again
the
doctor
and
i
had
put
on
our
hats
and
left
the
house
from
that
date
forward
for
many
weeks
the
number
of
lost
grandmothers
that
were
found
in
the
mctougall
nursery
surpasses
belief
they
were
discovered
in
all
sorts
of
places
and
in
all
imaginable
circumstances
under
beds
tables
upturned
baths
and
in
closets
trunks
and
cupboards
and
always
in
a
condition
of
woeful
weakness
and
melancholy
destitution
the
part
of
grandmother
was
invariably
assigned
to
dolly
because
although
the
youngest
of
the
group
that
little
creature
possessed
a
power
of
acting
and
of
which
none
of
the
others
could
equal
at
first
they
were
careful
to
keep
as
close
to
the
original
event
as
possible
but
after
a
time
thirsting
for
variety
they
became
lax
and
the
grandmothers
were
found
not
only
by
granddaughters
but
by
daughters
and
cousins
and
nieces
and
nephews
but
the
play
never
varied
in
the
points
of
extreme
poverty
and
woe
because
dolly
refused
with
invincible
determination
to
change
or
modify
her
part
after
a
time
they
varied
the
performance
with
a
wedding
in
which
innumerable
dr
mellons
were
united
to
endless
lilly
blythes
but
after
the
real
wedding
took
place
and
the
cake
had
been
utterly
consumed
they
returned
to
their
first
love
lost
and
found
as
they
termed
it
or
the
play
so
in
course
of
time
the
house
over
the
way
was
actually
taken
and
furnished
edie
was
installed
therein
as
empress
i
as
her
devoted
slave
when
not
otherwise
engaged
and
to
say
truth
even
when
i
otherwise
engaged
i
always
managed
to
leave
my
heart
at
home
anatomists
may
perhaps
be
puzzled
by
this
statement
if
so
let
them
be
puzzled
was
also
installed
as
in
a
suite
of
apartments
consisting
of
one
room
and
a
closet
it
was
not
in
dr
mctougall
nursery
alone
that
the
game
of
lost
and
found
was
played
in
a
little
schoolroom
not
far
distant
from
our
abode
that
game
was
played
by
edie
assisted
by
robin
slidder
and
myself
with
considerable
success
robin
crossed
the
street
to
me
came
over
as
it
were
with
edith
the
conqueror
and
our
doggie
and
afterwards
became
a
most
valuable
ally
in
searching
for
drawing
forth
tempting
out
and
gathering
in
the
lost
he
and
i
sought
for
them
in
some
of
the
lowest
slums
of
london
knowledge
of
their
haunts
and
ways
and
his
persuasive
voice
had
influence
where
none
but
himself
or
some
one
like
him
could
have
made
any
impression
we
tempted
them
to
our
little
hall
with
occasional
feasts
in
which
buns
oranges
raisins
gingerbread
and
tea
played
prominent
parts
and
when
we
had
gathered
them
in
edith
came
to
them
like
an
angel
of
light
and
preached
to
them
the
gospel
of
jesus
at
once
by
example
tone
look
and
word
among
others
who
came
to
our
little
social
meetings
was
the
slogger
that
unpunished
criminal
not
only
launched
with
apparently
heart
and
soul
into
the
good
cause
but
he
was
the
means
of
inducing
many
others
to
come
and
when
in
after
years
his
old
comrade
mr
brassey
returned
from
his
enforced
residence
in
foreign
parts
the
slogger
sought
for
and
found
him
and
stuck
to
him
with
the
pertinacity
of
his
bulldog
nature
until
he
fairly
brought
him
in
thus
that
good
work
went
on
with
us
thus
it
is
going
on
at
the
present
time
in
many
many
parts
of
our
favoured
land
and
thus
it
will
go
on
with
god
blessing
until
his
people
shall
all
be
gathered
into
the
fold
of
the
good
shepherd
until
that
day
when
the
puzzlements
and
bewilderments
of
this
incomprehensible
life
shall
be
cleared
up
when
we
shall
be
enabled
to
understand
man
has
been
so
long
permitted
to
dwell
in
the
midst
of
conflicting
good
and
evil
and
why
he
has
been
required
to
live
on
earth
by
faith
and
not
by
sight
trusting
in
the
unquestionable
goodness
and
wisdom
of
him
who
is
our
life
and
our
light
in
all
our
work
whether
temporal
or
spiritual
we
had
the
help
and
powerful
sympathy
of
our
friend
dr
mctougall
and
his
family
also
of
friend
dobson
the
city
man
who
was
a
strong
man
in
more
ways
than
one
and
a
zealous
champion
of
righteousness
or
rightness
as
he
was
fond
of
calling
it
in
contradistinction
to
wrongness
i
meant
to
let
fall
the
curtain
at
this
point
but
something
which
i
can
not
explain
induces
me
to
keep
it
up
a
few
minutes
longer
in
order
to
tell
you
that
the
little
mctougalls
grew
up
to
be
splendid
men
and
women
that
dear
old
granny
is
still
alive
and
well
insomuch
that
she
bids
fair
to
become
a
serene
centenarian
that
my
sweet
edie
is
now
fair
fat
and
forty
that
i
am
grey
and
hearty
that
dumps
is
greyer
and
so
fat
as
well
as
stiff
that
he
wags
his
ridiculous
tail
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
brassey
and
the
slogger
have
gone
into
partnership
in
the
line
round
the
corner
and
that
robin
slidder
is
no
longer
a
boy
but
has
become
a
man
and
a
butler
he
is
still
in
our
service
and
declares
that
he
will
never
leave
it
my
firm
conviction
is
that
he
will
keep
his
word
as
long
as
he
can
so
now
amiable
reader
with
regret
and
the
best
of
wishes
we
make
our
final
wow
and
bid
you
my
doggie
and
i
the
end
