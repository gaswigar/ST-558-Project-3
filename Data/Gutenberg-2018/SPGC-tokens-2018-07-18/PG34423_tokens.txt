there
must

humph
said

scornfully
this
is
a
sir
said
sambo
you
rubbed
the
lamp
i
believe
what
does
this
mean
they
demanded
jack
and
the
i
once
upon
a
time
a
great
many
years
ago
there
lived
a
poor
woman
who
having
invested
all
her
savings
in
mining
shares
was
soon
brought
to
penury
and
want
she
had
bought
her
modest
little
home
and
all
there
was
in
it
on
the
instalment
plan
and
here
she
was
upon
a
certain
beautiful
morning
in
late
spring
absolutely
penniless
and
three
days
off
staring
her
in
the
face
were
payments
due
on
the
piano
the
kitchen
range
and
even
on
the
house
itself
moreover
the
winter
had
been
a
bitter
one
four
times
had
the
frozen
and
burst
and
a
plumber
bill
of
appalling
magnitude
had
come
in
the
morning
mail
with
the
stern
admonition
stamped
in
red
letters
at
the
bottom
long
past
due
please
remit
the
unhappy
woman
was
at
her
wit
ends
to
know
what
to
do
she
had
tried
to
sell
her
shares
in
amalgamated
only
to
find
that
that
once
promising
company
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
receiver
and
that
there
was
an
assessment
amounting
to
four
times
their
face
value
due
on
the
shares
so
that
every
possible
purchaser
to
whom
she
applied
refused
to
take
the
stock
off
her
hands
unless
she
paid
them
five
dollars
a
share
for
the
service
and
would
guarantee
them
against
the
chance
of
further
loss
all
other
means
of
raising
the
necessary
funds
and
she
had
tried
them
all
proved
equally
futile
the
would
not
lend
her
a
penny
on
a
house
of
which
the
parlor
floor
alone
was
clear
of
obligation
and
the
threat
of
the
piano
people
to
remove
that
instrument
if
the
march
instalment
now
a
month
was
not
immediately
forthcoming
rendered
that
both
unsalable
and
valueless
as
security
for
a
loan
illustration
she
sat
the
perfect
picture
of
hopeless
despair
in
her
gazing
moodily
out
of
the
window
thinking
dreadful
thoughts
and
it
may
be
contemplating
the
alternative
of
suicide
or
marriage
with
the
village
magnate
a
miserable
villain
whom
everybody
detested
and
who
everybody
knew
very
well
had
been
instrumental
in
the
ruin
of
her
deceased
husband
a
once
prosperous
haberdasher
but
on
a
sudden
her
look
of
despair
faded
wholly
away
and
a
great
light
of
happiness
illumined
her
eyes
as
up
the
garden
path
whistling
merrily
as
he
strode
along
came
her
son
jack
a
lad
of
fifteen
the
comfort
and
solace
of
her
lonely
days
dear
boy
she
murmured
softly
to
herself
as
he
waved
his
hand
at
her
he
is
the
only
thing
i
have
left
that
there
is
something
due
on
the
boy
entering
the
room
still
whistling
flung
his
cap
up
on
the
table
and
kissed
his
mother
affectionately
well
mother
he
said
joyously
our
troubles
are
over
at
last
her
face
beamed
an
eager
inquiry
the
sudden
overwhelming
happiness
of
the
news
itself
deprived
her
of
the
power
of
speech
for
a
moment
and
then
with
difficulty
she
gasped
out
the
words
then
you
have
secured
a
place
with
steady
wages
my
son
her
heart
beat
wildly
as
she
awaited
the
answer
no
mother
he
replied
promptly
the
only
position
open
to
me
was
that
of
private
secretary
to
old
jonas
bilkins
my
father
enemy
and
when
he
found
out
that
i
was
my
father
son
he
fired
me
out
of
his
office
no
wonder
muttered
the
woman
he
did
dare
let
you
have
access
to
his
private
papers
he
knows
that
every
penny
he
calls
his
own
belongs
by
right
to
us
and
once
you
got
hold
of
his
and
secret
documents
you
could
prove
it
illustration
so
he
said
mother
dear
said
the
boy
he
was
brutally
frank
about
it
and
when
i
told
him
what
i
thought
of
him
and
advised
him
to
pick
out
a
nice
comfortable
jail
to
spend
his
declining
years
in
he
threw
his
at
my
head
the
miserable
villain
groaned
the
old
lady
did
it
hit
you
no
indeed
laughed
jack
my
baseball
training
helped
me
out
there
i
caught
it
on
the
fly
and
have
brought
it
home
with
me
meanwhile
i
have
sold
the
cow
you
have
cried
the
delighted
mother
clasping
him
warmly
in
her
arms
yes
said
jack
proudly
we
need
not
go
hungry
mother
i
swapped
her
off
for
a
pot
of
beans
illustration
the
beans
scattered
in
every
direction
an
awful
despairing
silence
followed
this
announcement
the
old
lady
loved
her
son
beyond
everything
in
the
world
but
this
was
too
much
even
for
a
mother
love
the
idea
that
a
jersey
cow
worth
not
less
than
dollars
regarded
merely
as
raw
material
for
the
table
and
not
taking
into
account
her
value
as
a
producer
of
rich
creamy
milk
should
have
been
bartered
for
a
miserable
pot
of
beans
and
doubtless
pickled
beans
at
that
was
the
last
straw
of
misfortune
that
broke
the
back
of
the
camel
of
maternal
patience
and
with
certain
phrases
of
a
forceful
nature
she
seized
the
pot
from
her
son
trembling
hand
and
flung
it
with
such
impetus
against
the
garden
wall
that
it
was
shattered
into
countless
fragments
and
the
beans
scattered
in
every
direction
after
this
attack
of
rage
she
took
to
her
bed
weeping
bitterly
jack
too
stunned
by
his
kind
mother
wrath
retired
to
his
little
cot
in
the
attic
and
sought
relief
from
his
troubles
and
the
gnawing
pangs
of
hunger
in
sleep
but
lo
and
behold
the
following
morning
a
strange
thing
had
happened
jack
upon
waking
early
found
his
once
sunny
window
obscured
by
a
heavy
growth
of
leaves
and
on
dressing
rapidly
and
going
into
the
garden
to
see
what
had
caused
this
strange
condition
of
affairs
was
surprised
to
find
a
splendid
sprung
up
during
the
night
and
what
was
still
more
wonderful
still
springing
moving
rapidly
upward
like
the
escalator
he
had
once
seen
upon
the
elevated
railway
in
new
york
when
with
his
father
he
had
visited
that
wonderful
city
to
inspect
the
spring
and
autumn
styles
for
the
haberdashery
he
gazed
at
it
in
wondering
amazement
and
then
the
silence
was
broken
all
aboard
for
ogreville
cried
a
squeaky
little
voice
from
behind
one
of
the
branches
step
lively
please
all
aboard
jack
nothing
loath
for
a
new
experience
immediately
seated
himself
astride
one
of
the
rapidly
rising
tendrils
and
soon
found
himself
soaring
in
the
upper
air
far
far
above
the
earth
upon
what
he
came
subsequently
to
call
his
well
we
have
you
at
last
said
the
squeaky
little
voice
from
behind
the
leaves
pleasantly
you
may
not
remember
it
my
lad
but
you
once
gave
up
your
strap
on
a
subway
train
to
a
woman
and
she
has
never
forgotten
your
kindness
it
so
happens
that
she
was
queen
of
the
fairies
and
later
on
she
became
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
united
states
fairy
corporation
of
wall
street
you
are
now
about
to
receive
your
reward
you
have
major
bilkins
with
you
yes
said
jack
he
threw
it
at
me
yesterday
and
i
had
it
ever
since
good
said
the
squeaky
little
voice
what
is
the
old
man
balance
three
million
five
hundred
and
thousand
four
hundred
and
dollars
said
jack
reading
off
the
figures
slowly
and
gasping
at
the
thought
of
anybody
having
so
much
money
as
that
on
hand
h
said
the
squeaky
little
voice
it
is
rather
less
than
i
had
thought
however
we
can
fix
that
without
much
trouble
zeros
are
cheap
just
add
six
of
them
to
that
balance
do
you
mean
add
or
affix
asked
jack
affix
is
what
i
should
have
said
replied
the
squeaky
little
voice
get
out
your
fountain
pen
and
tag
on
jack
immediately
obeyed
now
what
does
it
come
to
asked
the
little
voice
three
trillion
five
hundred
and
billion
four
hundred
and
million
dollars
stammered
jack
his
eyes
bulging
with
amazement
that
better
laughed
the
little
voice
thus
you
see
my
boy
how
easy
it
is
to
make
much
out
of
a
little
if
you
only
know
how
three
and
a
half
trillions
is
a
pretty
tidy
bit
of
for
a
boy
of
your
age
so
be
careful
how
you
use
it
my
son
use
it
wisely
and
all
will
be
well
with
you
as
the
voice
spoke
these
words
the
growing
stalk
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
the
voice
added
ogreville
last
stop
all
out
the
boy
stepped
off
the
stalk
and
found
himself
in
a
magnificently
broad
and
fertile
country
great
fields
of
waving
grain
numberless
pasturages
filled
with
prize
cattle
of
all
sorts
surrounded
him
on
every
hand
trees
heavily
laden
with
rare
fruits
bordered
the
highways
and
everything
everywhere
bore
unmistakable
evidences
of
a
rare
prosperity
whistled
jack
blinking
with
joy
at
all
he
saw
before
him
this
looks
like
the
land
of
milk
and
honey
all
right
and
only
twenty
minutes
by
from
new
york
what
a
chance
for
corner
lots
and
an
easy
suburb
for
business
men
the
lad
wandered
along
for
a
while
rejoicing
in
all
the
beauties
of
the
wondrous
scene
when
coming
to
a
turn
in
the
magnificently
laid
road
he
perceived
not
far
ahead
of
him
a
splendidly
built
castle
much
resembling
a
famous
city
hotel
he
had
once
passed
on
a
coach
and
remembering
on
a
sudden
that
he
had
had
no
breakfast
he
walked
boldly
up
to
the
main
entrance
and
knocked
on
the
massive
bronze
door
a
beautiful
young
girl
about
his
own
age
answered
the
summons
i
do
know
if
this
is
a
hotel
said
jack
politely
but
if
it
is
might
i
get
a
bite
here
i
fear
you
might
if
my
stepfather
should
happen
to
see
you
replied
the
girl
with
a
shudder
her
face
mantling
with
a
deep
luscious
red
the
like
of
which
jack
had
never
seen
anywhere
save
on
the
petal
of
a
rose
or
the
cheek
of
a
cherry
the
silvery
tones
of
her
voice
thrilled
him
thank
you
he
said
stepping
into
the
hallway
through
the
open
door
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
meet
your
stepfather
and
if
while
i
am
waiting
i
might
have
a
couple
of
scrambled
eggs
and
a
cup
of
coffee
oh
go
do
not
stay
here
pleaded
the
girl
please
go
i
go
laughed
jack
and
leave
you
never
but
you
do
not
understand
trembled
the
girl
my
stepfather
is
an
ogre
and
he
eats
i
only
understand
one
thing
said
jack
valiantly
and
that
is
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
do
care
if
your
stepfather
eats
for
my
sake
then
go
pleaded
the
girl
i
too
am
not
unsusceptible
to
the
dart
of
love
and
for
the
first
time
i
look
upon
a
spirit
i
could
honor
and
obey
but
then
it
is
love
at
first
sight
for
both
of
us
said
jack
folding
her
in
his
arms
it
was
indeed
a
blissful
moment
for
both
but
alas
it
was
more
than
fleeting
for
suddenly
there
came
from
an
inner
room
off
the
great
corridor
a
terrific
voice
roaring
i
smell
the
blood
of
a
boy
be
he
real
or
be
he
fake
i
grind
his
bones
for
a
buckwheat
cake
oho
cried
jack
springing
back
i
think
i
heard
something
like
that
before
this
is
not
a
hotel
but
the
castle
of
that
ogre
the
very
same
cried
the
girl
her
face
blanching
with
terror
and
what
is
worse
he
has
had
a
boy
to
eat
for
three
weeks
if
you
truly
love
me
i
beg
you
will
fly
at
once
sorry
to
be
disobliging
but
i
ca
fly
my
beloved
i
left
my
aeroplane
at
home
in
short
my
dear
er
er
what
is
your
name
sweetheart
beanhilda
replied
the
blushing
girl
in
short
my
dear
beanhilda
jack
resumed
having
no
wings
i
can
not
fly
alas
cried
the
girl
bursting
into
floods
of
tears
as
the
ogre
suddenly
appeared
in
the
hallway
and
seizing
jack
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
held
him
high
in
the
air
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
alas
it
is
too
late
i
shall
never
get
a
fiancé
past
no
my
child
grinned
the
ogre
smacking
his
lips
hungrily
it
is
not
too
late
he
is
just
in
time
i
have
been
wanting
a
couple
of
poached
boys
on
toast
for
three
solid
weeks
and
the
butcher
has
just
telephoned
me
that
there
is
a
fresh
kid
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
in
any
of
the
markets
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
ogre
said
jack
as
calmly
as
he
could
under
the
trying
circumstances
but
i
wo
poach
well
on
our
eleven
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
am
known
as
the
toughest
lad
in
my
native
town
a
shadow
of
disappointment
crossed
the
ogre
face
confound
football
he
growled
i
have
managed
to
get
a
tender
boy
since
the
season
opened
moreover
said
jack
seeing
that
the
time
for
strategy
had
arrived
i
did
come
here
for
your
breakfast
i
came
for
mine
by
jove
you
shall
have
it
cried
the
ogre
slapping
the
table
with
his
fists
so
hard
that
the
platters
and
glasses
upon
its
broad
surface
jumped
up
and
down
i
like
nerve
and
you
are
the
only
kid
i
caught
in
forty
years
that
did
begin
to
yell
like
mad
the
minute
i
grabbed
him
we
keep
you
here
and
feed
you
on
the
fat
of
the
land
until
you
have
sort
of
softened
up
sit
down
sir
and
have
your
fill
beanhilda
get
the
lad
a
cup
of
coffee
the
ogre
placed
jack
in
a
at
his
side
and
they
breakfasted
together
like
two
old
cronies
the
fair
beanhilda
waiting
upon
them
and
with
every
passing
moment
convincing
jack
by
her
grace
beauty
and
amiability
of
the
solid
fact
that
he
loved
her
ardently
it
was
a
terrible
sight
to
see
the
ogre
swallow
a
whole
lamb
at
one
bite
taking
it
up
by
its
tail
and
dropping
it
into
his
mouth
as
if
it
were
no
more
than
a
stalk
of
asparagus
and
consuming
not
less
than
varieties
of
breakfast
food
boxes
wrapping
premiums
and
all
at
one
spoonful
but
the
lad
nerve
never
deserted
him
for
a
moment
and
he
chatted
away
as
pleasantly
as
though
breakfasting
with
ogres
was
one
of
the
accustomed
operations
of
his
life
this
is
a
great
place
you
have
here
ogre
he
remarked
sipping
his
coffee
slowly
of
course
it
is
quite
as
rich
and
fertile
as
my
own
little
place
up
in
vermont
and
your
cattle
though
evidently
of
fine
breed
are
hardly
what
montana
would
consider
first
class
still
the
ogre
stopped
eating
and
looked
at
the
speaker
with
considerable
surprise
you
mean
to
say
you
can
beat
this
place
of
mine
anywhere
he
demanded
well
said
jack
amiably
of
course
i
do
mean
to
criticise
this
beautiful
country
it
is
very
beautiful
in
its
own
way
and
there
is
some
evidence
of
wealth
here
i
was
only
saying
that
next
to
my
place
it
comes
pretty
near
to
being
the
finest
i
ever
saw
i
guess
you
go
a
good
many
miles
before
you
see
a
castle
like
mine
said
the
ogre
with
a
proud
glance
around
him
i
have
seen
your
castle
yet
sir
said
jack
but
this
little
bungalow
we
are
in
strikes
me
as
about
as
cute
and
comfy
a
as
i
visited
in
a
month
of
sundays
bungalow
roared
the
giant
you
do
call
this
a
bungalow
do
you
why
yes
said
jack
it
certainly
is
a
tent
or
a
or
a
is
it
it
mighty
comfy
anyhow
whatever
you
call
it
i
would
mind
owning
it
myself
a
glitter
came
into
the
ogre
eyes
if
this
young
man
were
merely
bluffing
now
was
the
time
to
call
him
oh
as
for
that
said
the
ogre
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
you
can
own
it
that
is
you
can
if
you
can
pay
for
it
i
sell
here
he
winked
at
the
butler
as
much
as
to
say
now
we
see
him
flop
but
jack
had
no
intention
of
flopping
really
he
said
with
a
great
show
of
enthusiasm
well
this
is
fine
i
had
the
slightest
idea
the
place
was
in
the
market
but
if
we
can
get
together
on
a
figure
i
might
be
tempted
how
much
what
would
you
say
to
demanded
the
ogre
with
a
grim
smile
done
said
jack
and
cheap
at
the
price
here
he
drew
out
the
and
drew
a
check
for
the
full
amount
to
the
order
of
william
ogre
which
he
tossed
across
the
table
to
the
amazed
giant
there
your
money
he
said
fork
over
the
deeds
the
ogre
rubbed
his
eyes
and
almost
stopped
breathing
for
a
moment
h
he
muttered
inspecting
the
check
closely
this
looks
pretty
good
to
me
what
kind
of
a
book
is
that
young
man
that
laughed
jack
oh
that
what
we
call
the
magic
it
is
the
kind
that
all
our
big
financiers
use
rockernegie
colonel
midas
and
john
jacob
rothschild
and
all
the
rest
of
them
it
is
merely
an
ingenious
financial
contrivance
that
enables
us
to
avoid
contact
with
actual
money
which
is
not
only
vulgar
and
dangerous
to
carry
in
large
quantities
but
in
some
cases
is
full
of
germs
the
lad
went
on
and
explained
to
the
ogre
just
how
checks
were
drawn
and
presented
for
payment
it
a
pretty
nice
sort
of
an
arrangement
that
said
the
ogre
very
much
interested
but
suppose
you
draw
out
your
whole
balance
what
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
affix
a
half
dozen
ciphers
to
the
remainder
before
you
start
the
overdraft
said
jack
for
instance
on
my
way
up
here
this
morning
i
found
that
the
balance
on
hand
was
only
so
feeling
that
i
should
be
more
comfortable
with
just
a
little
more
ready
money
to
carry
me
along
i
added
those
six
ciphers
you
see
on
the
side
of
the
figures
bringing
the
balance
up
to
if
you
will
examine
the
ciphers
under
a
microscope
sir
you
will
note
that
they
have
only
recently
been
entered
by
thunder
roared
the
ogre
glaring
at
the
book
enviously
this
is
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
age
why
armed
with
a
book
like
that
you
can
buy
anything
in
sight
if
the
other
man
will
sell
said
jack
would
you
mind
if
i
lit
my
cigarette
go
ahead
go
ahead
do
anything
you
darn
please
said
the
ogre
gazing
at
him
with
wonder
jack
thereupon
drew
a
check
for
tore
it
from
the
book
and
rolled
it
into
a
small
cylinder
which
he
filled
with
some
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
then
lit
it
with
another
check
for
a
similar
amount
the
ogre
eyes
nearly
popped
out
of
his
head
at
such
a
marvellous
exhibition
of
resources
it
makes
an
expensive
smoke
smiled
jack
settling
back
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
cigarette
but
after
all
as
long
as
i
have
the
money
why
not
enjoy
myself
will
you
join
me
he
took
up
his
pen
as
though
to
make
another
no
no
no
cried
the
ogre
walking
agitatedly
up
and
down
the
floor
i
er
i
afraid
it
too
soon
after
breakfast
for
me
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
such
an
inexhaustible
treasure
as
this
really
exists
there
it
is
right
before
your
eyes
said
jack
suppose
we
test
it
think
of
a
large
sum
of
money
tell
me
what
it
is
and
see
if
i
ca
go
you
a
dollar
better
four
hundred
millions
cried
the
ogre
impulsively
piker
ejaculated
jack
with
a
smile
as
he
drew
his
check
for
a
billion
and
a
half
cried
the
ogre
now
you
beginning
to
get
your
pace
laughed
jack
there
my
check
sir
for
according
to
specifications
that
reduces
your
balance
some
though
said
the
ogre
yes
said
jack
it
reduces
it
by
leaving
me
with
only
on
hand
but
if
i
affix
six
ciphers
to
that
as
i
will
now
proceed
to
do
i
have
as
the
figures
conclusively
show
or
about
a
squillion
more
than
i
had
before
i
began
to
draw
illustration
the
ogre
collapsed
in
his
chair
the
ogre
collapsed
in
his
chair
the
magnitude
of
these
figures
appalled
him
great
glory
he
cried
i
did
know
there
was
that
much
money
in
the
world
can
can
anybody
work
that
book
anybody
who
comes
by
it
honestly
and
without
trickery
said
jack
of
course
if
a
man
gets
hold
of
it
in
an
unscrupulous
way
or
goes
back
on
his
bargain
it
as
valueless
to
him
as
so
much
waste
paper
the
ogre
strode
up
and
down
the
room
filled
with
agitation
he
had
thought
to
trick
the
boy
out
of
his
wonderful
possession
in
fact
to
swallow
him
whole
and
then
appropriate
his
treasure
but
explanation
put
an
entirely
new
phase
on
the
matter
i
suppose
you
would
part
with
that
book
he
finally
asked
yes
said
jack
i
let
you
have
it
if
you
will
transfer
all
your
property
irrevocably
to
your
stepdaughter
beanhilda
and
give
me
her
hand
in
marriage
it
a
bargain
gulped
the
ogre
whereupon
he
summoned
his
lawyers
and
his
secretaries
and
by
noon
all
his
possessions
had
passed
beyond
recall
into
the
hands
of
beanhilda
a
special
messenger
was
sent
down
the
to
fetch
jack
mother
and
that
afternoon
the
happy
lad
and
the
fair
princess
of
ogreville
were
married
with
much
pomp
and
ceremony
illustration
bless
you
my
children
bless
you
my
children
murmured
the
ogre
as
the
irrevocable
words
were
spoken
by
the
priest
and
jack
passed
the
magic
over
to
its
new
owner
may
you
live
long
and
happily
as
for
me
i
off
for
a
week
vacation
in
little
old
new
york
illustration
a
week
vacation
in
little
old
new
york
how
did
you
manage
it
sweetheart
whispered
beanhilda
in
her
husband
ear
a
few
weeks
later
had
such
a
penchant
for
boys
that
i
feared
you
were
lost
the
moment
he
appeared
jack
explained
the
whole
history
of
the
magic
to
her
but
when
he
had
done
his
bride
grew
white
but
what
if
he
comes
back
she
cried
shuddering
with
fear
his
vengeance
will
be
terrible
have
no
fear
beanhilda
jack
answered
he
will
not
return
read
that
and
he
handed
her
an
evening
paper
in
which
with
rapidly
drying
eyes
she
read
the
following
years
for
passing
bad
checks
william
ogre
claiming
to
be
a
prominent
resident
of
ogreville
who
was
arrested
at
the
gotham
hotel
last
thursday
afternoon
on
a
charge
of
having
passed
a
dozen
bogus
checks
for
amounts
ranging
from
ten
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
apiece
was
found
guilty
yesterday
by
a
jury
in
the
criminal
branch
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
he
was
sentenced
to
fifteen
years
imprisonment
at
hard
labor
in
the
federal
prison
at
thomasville
georgia
on
each
of
the
five
different
counts
making
his
prison
term
in
all
not
less
than
years
other
indictments
are
still
pending
against
him
for
forgery
on
the
complaint
of
major
bilkins
president
of
the
suburban
trust
company
of
whose
name
he
was
found
availing
himself
in
his
criminal
transactions
major
bilkins
when
seen
last
night
by
a
reporter
of
this
paper
stated
his
intention
of
keeping
the
shameless
operator
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
i
should
sit
up
for
papa
if
i
were
you
beanhilda
said
jack
with
a
smile
it
looks
to
me
as
if
he
was
going
to
be
detained
late
on
business
and
the
young
couple
lived
happily
forever
after
ii
the
great
wish
syndicate
the
farm
had
gone
to
ruin
on
every
side
the
pastures
were
filled
with
a
rank
growth
of
thistles
and
other
flora
the
farm
buildings
had
fallen
into
a
condition
of
hopeless
disrepair
and
the
old
house
the
ancestral
home
of
the
wilbrahams
had
become
a
place
of
appalling
desolation
the
roof
had
been
patched
and
repatched
for
decades
and
now
fulfilled
none
of
the
ideals
of
its
roofhood
save
that
of
antiquity
there
was
not
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
a
single
whole
pane
of
glass
in
any
one
of
the
many
windows
of
the
mansion
and
there
were
not
wanting
those
in
the
community
who
were
willing
to
prophesy
that
in
a
stiff
gale
such
as
used
to
be
prevalent
in
that
section
of
the
world
and
within
the
recollection
of
some
of
the
old
settlers
too
the
chimneys
once
the
pride
of
the
county
would
totter
and
fall
bringing
the
whole
mansion
down
into
chaos
and
ruin
in
short
the
model
farm
of
the
wilbrahams
had
become
a
and
a
jest
and
as
some
said
of
no
earthly
use
save
for
the
particular
purposes
of
the
eccentric
artist
in
search
of
picturesque
for
his
studies
in
oil
illustration
within
the
ancient
house
sat
the
owner
richard
wilbraham
it
was
a
wild
night
and
within
the
ancient
house
sat
the
owner
richard
wilbraham
his
wife
not
far
away
trying
to
find
room
upon
her
last
remaining
pair
of
socks
to
darn
them
wilbraham
gazed
silently
into
the
glowing
embers
on
the
hearth
before
them
the
stillness
of
the
evening
broken
only
by
the
hissing
of
the
logs
on
the
andirons
and
an
occasional
sigh
from
one
of
the
watchers
finally
the
woman
spoke
when
does
the
mortgage
fall
due
richard
she
asked
moving
uneasily
in
her
chair
gulped
the
man
the
word
seeming
to
catch
in
his
throat
and
choke
him
and
you
you
are
sure
colonel
digby
will
not
renew
it
she
queried
he
even
declines
to
discuss
the
matter
said
wilbraham
he
contents
himself
with
shaking
it
in
my
face
every
time
i
approach
his
office
while
he
tells
his
to
escort
me
to
the
door
i
do
believe
in
signs
ethelinda
but
i
do
believe
that
that
is
an
omen
that
if
the
money
is
not
forthcoming
at
noon
you
and
i
will
be
roofless
by
this
time
night
the
woman
shuddered
but
richard
she
protested
you
you
had
put
by
the
money
to
pay
it
long
ago
what
has
become
of
it
gone
ethelinda
gone
in
that
egg
deal
i
tried
to
put
through
two
years
ago
sighed
wilbraham
as
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
to
hide
his
grief
and
mortification
i
sold
eggs
short
he
added
you
remember
when
that
first
batch
of
incubator
hens
began
laying
so
prolifically
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
fortune
stared
me
in
the
face
nay
held
out
her
hands
to
me
and
bade
me
welcome
to
a
share
in
her
vast
estates
there
was
a
great
shortage
of
eggs
in
the
market
that
year
and
i
went
to
new
york
and
sold
them
by
the
dozens
hundreds
of
dozens
thousands
of
dozens
he
rose
up
from
his
chair
and
paced
the
floor
in
an
ecstasy
of
agitation
i
sold
eggs
by
the
million
ethelinda
he
went
on
by
a
great
effort
regaining
control
of
himself
eggs
to
be
laid
by
hens
whose
had
yet
to
be
hatched
from
eggs
yet
unlaid
by
unborn
chickens
wilbraham
voice
sank
to
a
hoarse
guttural
whisper
and
the
deliveries
have
bankrupted
me
he
muttered
the
price
of
eggs
has
risen
steadily
for
the
past
eighteen
months
and
yesterday
a
hundred
thousand
of
january
strictly
fresh
that
i
had
to
buy
in
the
open
market
in
order
to
fill
my
contracts
cost
me
not
only
my
last
penny
but
were
in
part
paid
for
with
a
note
that
i
can
not
hope
to
meet
in
other
words
ethelinda
we
are
ruined
the
woman
made
a
brave
struggle
to
be
strong
but
the
strain
was
too
much
for
her
tired
nerves
and
she
broke
down
and
wept
bitterly
we
have
but
four
hens
left
wilbraham
went
on
speaking
in
a
hollow
voice
at
most
working
them
to
their
full
capacity
in
thirty
days
from
now
we
shall
have
only
ten
dozen
eggs
added
to
our
present
store
and
upon
that
date
i
have
promised
to
deliver
to
the
international
cold
storage
company
one
thousand
dozen
at
and
a
half
cents
a
dozen
even
with
the
mortgage
out
of
the
way
we
should
still
be
securely
bound
in
the
clutch
of
bankruptcy
a
long
silence
ensued
the
clock
out
in
the
hall
ticked
loudly
each
clicking
sound
falling
upon
wilbraham
ears
like
a
blow
in
a
forge
welding
link
by
link
a
chain
of
ruin
that
should
forever
bind
him
in
the
shackles
of
misery
unbroken
save
by
the
banging
now
and
then
of
a
shutter
in
the
howling
wind
without
the
silence
continued
for
nearly
an
hour
when
the
monotony
of
the
ceaseless
of
the
clock
was
varied
by
a
resounding
hammering
upon
the
door
it
is
very
late
said
the
woman
who
do
you
suppose
can
be
calling
at
this
hour
be
careful
when
you
open
the
door
it
may
be
a
highwayman
i
should
welcome
a
highwayman
if
he
could
help
me
to
find
anything
in
the
house
worth
stealing
said
wilbraham
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
started
for
the
door
whoever
it
may
be
it
is
a
wild
night
and
despite
our
poverty
we
can
still
keep
open
house
for
the
stranger
on
the
moor
he
hastened
to
the
door
and
flung
it
wide
who
there
he
cried
gazing
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
storm
a
heavy
gust
of
wind
icy
cold
blew
out
his
candle
and
a
great
mass
of
sleet
coming
in
with
it
fell
with
a
dull
sodden
thud
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
and
some
of
it
cut
his
cheek
i
am
a
wanderer
came
a
faint
voice
from
without
frozen
and
starved
in
the
name
of
humanity
i
beg
you
to
take
me
in
lest
i
faint
and
perish
come
in
come
in
cried
wilbraham
whoever
you
are
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
that
which
is
left
us
little
enough
in
all
conscience
an
aged
man
bent
and
weary
staggered
in
through
the
door
wilbraham
sprang
toward
him
and
caught
his
fainting
form
in
his
strong
arms
tenderly
he
led
him
to
his
own
abandoned
chair
by
the
fireside
where
he
and
his
faithful
wife
chafed
the
old
fellow
hands
until
warmth
had
returned
to
them
a
cup
of
tea
my
dear
said
wilbraham
it
will
set
him
up
and
a
morsel
to
eat
i
implore
you
pleaded
the
stranger
in
a
weak
tremulous
voice
the
merest
trifle
good
sir
even
if
it
be
only
an
egg
the
woman
grew
rigid
at
the
suggestion
an
egg
at
this
time
when
eggs
are
she
began
there
there

interrupted
wilbraham
gently
we
have
two
left
in
the
your
breakfast
and
mine
rather
than
see
this
good
old
man
suffer
longer
i
will
gladly
go
without
mine
the
fact
is
eggs
have
sort
of
disagreed
with
me
latterly
anyhow
and
it
is
as
you
say
richard
said
the
woman
meekly
as
with
a
hopeless
sigh
she
turned
toward
the
kitchen
whence
in
a
short
time
she
returned
bearing
a
steaming
creation
of
her
own
make
a
lustrous
golden
egg
poached
and
lying
invitingly
upon
the
crisp
bosom
of
a
piece
of
toast
it
was
a
sight
of
beauty
and
wilbraham
mouth
watered
as
he
gazed
hungrily
upon
it
and
then
the
unexpected
happened
the
aged
stranger
instead
of
voraciously
devouring
the
proffered
meal
with
a
kindly
glance
upon
his
host
raised
his
withered
hands
aloft
as
though
to
pronounce
a
benediction
upon
him
and
in
a
chanting
tone
droned
forth
the
lines
who
eats
this
egg
and
toast
delicious
receives
the
gift
of
three
full
wishes
thus
do
the
fairy
folk
reward
the
sacrifices
of
this
board
a
low
rumbling
peal
of
thunder
and
a
blinding
flash
as
of
the
lightning
followed
and
when
the
brilliant
illumination
of
the
latter
had
died
away
the
stranger
had
vanished
wilbraham
looked
at
his
wife
dumb
with
amazement
and
she
tottering
backward
into
her
chair
gazed
back
her
eyes
distended
with
fear
have
i
have
i
been
dreaming
he
gasped
recovering
his
speech
in
a
moment
or
have
we
really
had
a
visitor
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
question
richard
she
replied
it
really
was
so
very
extraordinary
i
can
hardly
believe
and
then
their
eyes
fell
upon
the
steaming
egg
still
lying
like
a
beautiful
sunset
on
a
background
of
toast
upon
the
table
the
egg
she
cried
hoarsely
it
must
have
been
true
will
you
eat
it
asked
wilbraham
politely
extending
the
platter
in
her
direction
never
she
cried
shuddering
i
should
not
dare
it
is
too
uncanny
then
i
will
said
wilbraham
if
the
old
man
spoke
the
truth
he
swallowed
the
egg
at
a
single
gulp
fine
he
murmured
in
an
ecstasy
of
gastronomic
pleasure
i
wish
there
were
two
more
just
like
it
no
sooner
had
he
spoken
these
words
than
two
more
poached
eggs
even
as
he
had
wished
appeared
upon
the
platter
great
heavens
ethelinda
he
cried
the
wishes
come
true
i
wish
to
goodness
i
knew
who
that
old
duffer
was
the
words
had
scarcely
fallen
from
his
lips
when
a
card
fluttered
down
from
the
ceiling
wilbraham
sprang
forward
excitedly
and
caught
it
as
it
fell
it
read
henry
oberon
secretary
the
united
states
fairy
wall
street
henry
oberon
united
states
fairy
company
wall
street
eh
he
muttered
by
jove
i
wish
i
knew
stop
cried
his
wife
seizing
him
by
the
arm
imploringly
do
stop
richard
you
have
used
up
two
of
your
wishes
already
think
what
you
need
most
before
you
waste
the
third
wise
ethelinda
he
murmured
patting
her
gently
on
the
hand
very
very
wise
and
i
will
be
careful
let
me
see
now
i
wish
i
had
i
wish
i
had
he
paused
for
a
long
time
and
then
his
face
fairly
beamed
with
a
great
light
of
joy
i
wish
i
had
three
more
wishes
he
cried
another
crash
of
thunder
shook
the
house
to
its
very
foundations
and
a
lightning
flash
turned
the
darkness
of
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
into
a
vivid
golden
yellow
that
dazzled
them
and
then
all
went
dusk
again
mercy
shuddered
the
good
wife
i
hope
that
was
an
answer
to
your
wish
it
wo
take
long
to
find
out
said
wilbraham
i
tackle
a
few
more
natural
desires
right
here
and
now
and
if
they
come
true
know
that
that
thunderbolt
was
a
rush
message
from
the
united
states
fairy
company
telling
me
to
draw
on
them
at
sight
well
do
be
extravagant
his
wife
cautioned
him
i
be
as
extravagant
as
i
please
he
retorted
if
my
fourth
wish
works
ethelinda
my
address
from
this
hour
on
will
be
easy
street
and
treasury
avenue
i
wish
first
then
that
this
old
farm
was
in
ballyhack
illustration
ballyhack
last
station
all
out
ballyhack
last
station
all
out
cried
a
hoarse
voice
at
the
door
wilbraham
rushed
to
the
window
and
peered
out
into
what
had
been
the
night
but
had
now
become
a
picture
of
something
worse
great
clouds
of
impenetrable
smoke
hung
over
the
grim
stretches
of
a
country
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
charred
remnants
of
ruined
trees
and
blackened
rocks
over
which
in
an
endless
line
a
weary
mass
of
struggling
plodders
men
and
women
toiled
onward
through
the
grime
of
a
hopeless
environment
great
scott
he
cried
in
dismay
as
the
squalid
misery
of
the
prospect
smote
upon
his
vision
this
is
worse
than
diggville
i
wish
to
heaven
we
were
back
again
diggville
change
cars
for
easy
street
and
fortune
square
cried
the
hoarse
voice
at
the
door
and
wilbraham
looking
out
through
the
window
again
was
rejoiced
to
find
himself
back
amid
familiar
scenes
they
working
all
right
he
said
gleefully
yes
said
his
wife
they
seem
to
be
and
you
seem
to
be
speculating
as
usual
upon
a
narrow
margin
again
you
have
only
one
wish
left
having
squandered
four
out
of
the
five
already
used
and
why
not
my
dear
smiled
wilbraham
amiably
when
my
next
wish
is
to
be
for
six
spandy
new
wishes
straight
from
the
factory
wilbraham
face
cleared
oh
splendid
she
cried
joyously
wish
it
wish
it
do
hurry
before
you
forget
i
do
wish
it
six
more
wishes
on
the
roared
wilbraham
as
before
came
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
thank
you
said
wilbraham
these
fairies
are
mighty
prompt
correspondents
i
am
beginning
to
see
my
way
out
of
our
difficulties
ethelinda
he
proceeded
rubbing
his
hands
together
unctuously
instead
of
dreading
and
the
maturity
of
that
beastly
old
mortgage
i
wish
to
thunder
it
were
here
and
that
the
confounded
thing
were
paid
off
the
wish
expressed
impulsively
brought
about
the
most
astonishing
results
the
hall
clock
began
instantly
to
whirr
and
to
wheeze
its
hands
whizzing
about
as
though
upon
a
pivot
the
sun
shot
up
out
of
the
eastern
horizon
as
though
fired
from
a
cannon
and
before
the
amazed
couple
could
realize
what
was
going
on
the
village
clock
struck
the
hour
of
noon
and
they
found
themselves
bowing
old
colonel
digby
the
mortgage
holder
out
of
the
house
while
wilbraham
himself
held
in
his
right
hand
a
complete
satisfaction
of
that
depressing
document
now
said
wilbraham
i
feel
like
celebrating
what
would
you
say
to
a
nice
little
luncheon
my
dear
something
simple
but
good
say
some
russian
caviare
lynnhaven
bay
oysters
real
turtle
soup
terrapin
duck
salad
and
an
orange
brûlot
for
two
eh
it
would
be
fine
richard
replied
the
lady
her
eyes
flashing
with
joy
but
i
do
know
where
we
could
get
such
a
feast
here
the
diggville
markets
are
markets
cried
wilbraham
contemptuously
what
have
we
to
do
with
markets
from
this
time
on
markets
are
nothing
to
me
i
merely
wish
that
we
had
that
repast
right
here
and
now
ready
to
luncheon
is
served
sir
said
a
tall
stranger
entering
from
the
ah
really
said
wilbraham
and
who
the
dickens
are
you
i
am
the
head
butler
of
the
fairies
union
assigned
to
your
service
sir
replied
the
stranger
civilly
making
a
low
bow
to
wilbraham
there
is
no
use
of
describing
the
meal
it
was
all
there
as
foreshadowed
in
wilbraham
gastronomically
inspired
menu
and
having
had
nothing
to
eat
since
the
night
before
the
fortunate
couple
did
full
justice
to
it
before
we
go
any
further
richard
said
wilbraham
after
the
duck
had
been
served
do
you
happen
to
remember
how
many
of
your
last
six
wishes
are
left
no
i
do
said
wilbraham
then
you
had
better
order
a
few
more
lest
by
the
end
of
this
charming
repast
you
forget
said
the
thoughtful
woman
good
scheme
ethelinda
said
wilbraham
i
put
in
a
bid
for
a
gross
right
away
there
is
no
use
in
piking
along
in
small
orders
when
you
can
do
a
business
without
lifting
your
little
finger
and
do
you
think
too
dear
the
woman
continued
that
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
open
a
set
of
books
a
sort
of
general
wish
account
so
that
we
shall
not
at
any
time
by
some
unfortunate
mistake
overdraw
our
balance
ethelinda
cried
wilbraham
his
face
glowing
with
enthusiastic
admiration
you
have
without
any
exception
the
best
business
head
that
ever
wore
a
pompadour
thus
it
began
a
was
purchased
and
in
its
columns
like
so
many
entries
of
mere
dollars
wilbraham
entered
his
income
in
wishes
faithfully
recording
on
the
opposite
page
his
expenditures
in
the
same
the
first
entry
of
one
gross
was
made
that
very
night
march
sight
draft
on
fairy
before
long
others
followed
and
were
used
to
such
an
effect
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
by
a
careful
manipulation
of
his
resources
carefully
husbanding
the
possibilities
of
that
original
third
wish
wilbraham
found
that
he
had
expressed
and
had
had
gratified
over
ten
thousand
wishes
all
of
such
a
nature
that
the
decrepit
farm
had
now
become
one
of
the
handsomest
estates
in
the
country
a
château
stood
on
the
site
of
the
old
mansion
where
the
barns
had
been
in
danger
of
falling
of
their
own
weight
were
now
to
be
found
rows
of
and
dairies
of
splendor
the
decaying
stables
had
become
garages
of
unusual
magnificence
wherein
cars
of
all
horsepowers
and
models
panted
eager
to
be
chugging
over
the
roads
of
diggville
which
by
a
single
wish
expressed
by
wilbraham
had
become
wondrously
paved
boulevards
and
in
the
that
had
taken
the
place
of
the
discouraging
coops
of
other
days
thousands
of
hens
laid
their
daily
quota
of
prosperity
for
their
owner
in
the
nests
provided
for
their
comfort
by
wilbraham
the
egg
king
for
that
was
what
he
had
now
become
in
all
parts
of
the
world
his
fame
was
heralded
and
hosts
of
came
daily
to
see
the
wonderful
acres
of
this
lordly
master
of
the
world
egg
supply
and
best
of
all
there
was
still
a
balance
of
hundred
and
wishes
to
his
credit
the
leading
financiers
of
the
world
now
began
to
take
notice
of
this
new
figure
in
the
realm
of
effort
for
they
soon
found
their
most
treasured
and
surest
schemes
going
awry
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
no
matter
how
much
they
tried
to
depress
or
to
stimulate
the
market
some
new
and
strange
factor
seemed
to
be
at
work
bringing
their
calculations
to
naught
and
when
it
became
known
to
them
that
the
mere
expression
of
a
wish
on
the
part
of
wilbraham
would
send
stocks
kiting
into
the
air
or
crashing
into
the
depths
no
matter
what
they
might
do
they
began
to
worry
said
john
midas
as
he
talked
to
wilbraham
and
his
friends
one
evening
at
the
club
international
gold
brick
common
will
fall
off
points
not
so
colonel
wilbraham
had
retorted
it
will
rise
seventy
points
oh
it
will
will
it
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
midas
because
i
wish
it
said
wilbraham
and
on
the
morrow
international
gold
brick
opening
at
lo
and
behold
closed
at
and
the
friends
of
midas
who
had
laughed
at
wilbraham
and
sold
short
went
to
the
wall
a
experiences
of
a
similar
nature
showed
the
former
rulers
of
the
financial
world
that
wilbraham
had
now
become
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
and
for
their
own
protection
the
more
eminent
among
them
called
a
meeting
at
the
home
of
andrew
rockernegie
to
consider
the
situation
there
was
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
one
man
they
thought
although
that
idea
had
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
before
the
result
of
the
meeting
was
that
colonel
midas
was
appointed
a
committee
of
one
to
call
upon
wilbraham
and
see
what
could
be
done
you
may
not
be
aware
of
it
wilbraham
said
the
colonel
but
by
your
occasional
intrusions
into
our
lines
of
work
you
are
making
finance
an
inexact
science
now
what
will
you
take
to
keep
your
hands
off
the
market
altogether
twenty
millions
wilbraham
laughed
really
colonel
midas
he
replied
i
had
no
idea
that
you
ever
did
business
on
a
basis
like
that
you
ought
to
run
a
vacuum
cleaner
over
your
brow
i
think
there
are
cobwebs
in
your
gray
matter
why
my
dear
sir
i
can
capitalize
this
gift
of
mine
at
a
billion
and
pay
ten
per
cent
on
every
dollar
of
it
every
year
with
a
little
melon
to
be
cut
up
annually
by
the
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
per
cent
per
annum
why
then
should
i
sell
out
at
twenty
millions
oh
i
suppose
you
can
have
the
earth
if
you
want
it
retorted
midas
ruefully
but
all
the
same
no
i
do
want
the
earth
said
wilbraham
if
i
had
wanted
it
i
should
have
had
it
long
ago
i
only
have
to
pay
taxes
on
it
and
it
would
be
a
nuisance
looking
after
the
property
on
what
basis
will
you
sell
out
demanded
midas
well
we
might
incorporate
my
gift
said
wilbraham
what
would
you
say
to
a
united
states
wish
syndicate
formed
to
produce
and
sell
wishes
to
the
public
by
the
can
potted
wishes
one
hundred
wishes
for
a
dollar
eh
midas
paced
the
floor
in
his
enthusiasm
magnificent
he
cried
we
underwrite
the
whole
thing
in
my
office
bonds
stock
both
common
and
preferred
for
say
ahem
how
much
did
you
say
oh
i
guess
i
can
pull
along
on
a
billion
said
wilbraham
cash
midas
scratched
his
head
a
glitter
came
into
his
eye
you
wish
to
give
up
control
of
your
gift
he
asked
you
are
a
clever
man
colonel
midas
grinned
wilbraham
if
i
had
said
to
that
question
i
have
lost
my
power
but
i
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
that
way
you
go
ahead
and
form
your
company
and
sell
your
securities
to
the
public
at
par
pay
me
my
billion
and
i
transfer
the
business
to
you
done
said
midas
and
he
returned
to
his
on
the
street
wilbraham
was
felicitating
himself
upon
a
wondrously
good
stroke
of
business
when
another
caller
entered
his
room
this
time
unannounced
how
do
you
do
mr
wilbraham
said
the
stranger
as
he
mysteriously
materialized
before
wilbraham
desk
how
are
you
said
wilbraham
your
face
is
familiar
to
me
but
i
just
recall
where
i
have
met
you
my
name
is
oberon
sir
said
the
stranger
i
am
the
secretary
of
the
united
states
fairy
company
there
is
a
little
trouble
over
your
account
and
i
have
called
to
see
if
we
ca
wilbraham
heart
sank
within
him
it
it
is
overdrawn
is
it
he
whispered
hoarsely
no
it
is
said
the
secretary
by
jove
cried
wilbraham
drawing
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
springing
to
his
feet
grasping
oberon
by
both
hands
sit
down
sit
down
you
have
been
a
benefactor
to
me
sir
i
am
glad
you
realize
that
fact
wilbraham
said
the
fairy
somewhat
coldly
it
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
say
what
i
have
come
here
to
say
we
did
not
realize
wilbraham
he
went
on
when
we
awarded
you
the
three
original
wishes
that
you
would
be
clever
enough
to
work
the
wish
business
up
into
an
industry
if
we
had
we
should
have
made
the
wishes
we
were
perfectly
willing
to
permit
a
reasonable
overdraft
also
but
we
did
expect
you
to
pyramid
your
holdings
the
way
you
have
done
until
you
have
practically
secured
a
corner
in
the
market
wilbraham
grinned
broadly
i
have
been
going
some
he
said
rather
said
oberon
your
original
three
wishes
have
been
watered
until
we
find
in
going
over
our
books
for
the
second
year
that
they
reach
the
sum
total
of
three
million
five
hundred
and
thousand
four
hundred
and
and
that
you
still
have
an
unexpended
balance
on
hand
of
four
hundred
and
thousand
three
hundred
and
wishes
the
situation
is
just
this
he
continued
our
company
has
been
kept
so
busy
honoring
your
drafts
that
we
are
threatened
with
a
general
strike
we
did
mind
building
you
a
château
and
furbishing
up
your
old
and
setting
you
up
for
life
but
when
you
enter
into
negotiations
with
old
john
midas
to
incorporate
yourself
into
a
wish
trust
we
feel
that
the
time
has
come
to
call
a
halt
the
fairies
are
honest
and
no
obligation
of
theirs
will
ever
be
repudiated
but
we
think
that
a
man
who
tries
to
build
up
a
corporation
to
deal
in
wishes
on
an
investment
of
one
poached
egg
is
just
a
leetle
unreasonable
even
rockernegie
had
a
trifle
more
than
a
paper
of
tacks
when
he
founded
the
iron
trust
by
ginger
oberon
said
wilbraham
you
are
right
i
rather
put
it
on
to
you
people
and
i
sorry
i
would
embarrass
you
good
fairies
for
anything
in
the
world
good
cried
oberon
overjoyed
i
thought
you
would
feel
that
way
just
think
for
one
moment
what
it
would
mean
for
us
if
the
great
wish
syndicate
were
started
as
a
going
concern
with
a
board
of
directors
made
up
of
men
like
john
midas
rockernegie
and
old
bondifeller
running
things
why
there
are
fairies
enough
in
the
world
to
keep
up
with
those
men
and
the
whole
business
world
would
come
down
with
a
crash
their
wish
would
elect
a
whole
congress
if
they
wished
the
senate
out
of
washington
and
located
on
wall
street
you
soon
find
it
so
and
by
thunder
wilbraham
every
four
years
they
wish
somebody
in
the
white
house
with
a
great
capacity
for
taking
orders
and
not
enough
spine
to
fill
an
umbrella
cover
and
the
public
would
be
powerless
wilbraham
gazed
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
a
dazzling
prospect
of
imperial
proportions
loomed
up
before
his
vision
and
the
temptation
was
terrible
but
in
the
end
common
sense
came
to
the
rescue
it
would
be
a
terrible
nuisance
he
muttered
to
himself
and
then
turning
to
oberon
he
asked
what
is
your
proposition
a
compromise
said
the
fairy
if
you
give
up
your
right
to
further
wishes
on
our
account
we
will
place
you
in
a
position
where
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
you
will
always
have
four
dollars
more
than
you
need
and
in
addition
to
that
as
a
compliment
to
wilbraham
she
can
have
everything
she
wants
ha
said
wilbraham
dubiously
i
i
do
think
i
like
that
exactly
she
might
want
something
i
did
want
her
to
have
very
well
then
said
the
fairy
with
a
broad
smile
we
make
you
the
flat
proposition
you
give
us
a
deed
to
all
your
future
right
title
and
interest
in
our
wishes
and
we
will
guarantee
that
as
long
as
you
live
you
will
upon
every
occasion
find
in
your
pocket
five
dollars
more
than
you
need
make
it
seven
and
i
go
you
cried
wilbraham
really
enthusiastic
over
the
suggestion
sure
returned
oberon
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
well
dearest
said
wilbraham
that
night
as
he
sat
down
at
his
onyx
i
gone
out
of
the
wish
business
his
wife
eyes
lit
up
with
a
glow
of
happiness
you
have
she
cried
delightedly
yes
said
wilbraham
and
then
he
told
her
of
oberon
call
and
the
new
arrangement
and
was
rejoiced
beyond
measure
to
receive
her
approval
of
it
i
am
so
glad
richard
she
murmured
with
a
sigh
of
content
i
have
been
kept
so
busy
for
two
years
trying
to
think
of
new
things
to
wish
for
that
i
have
had
no
time
to
enjoy
all
the
beautiful
things
we
have
and
it
is
bad
to
have
seven
dollars
more
than
you
need
whenever
you
need
it
is
it
dearest
bad
richard
she
returned
bad
i
should
say
not
my
beloved
to
have
seven
dollars
more
than
you
need
at
all
times
is
to
my
mind
the
height
of
an
ideal
prosperity
i
need
five
thousand
dollars
at
this
very
minute
to
pay
my
milliner
bill
and
here
it
is
said
her
husband
taking
five
crisp
bills
from
his
vest
pocket
and
handing
them
to
her
and
here
are
seven
ones
besides
the
fairies
are
true
to
their
bargain
illustration
wilbraham
paid
before
leaving
the
and
they
lived
affluently
forever
afterward
although
midas
and
his
confrères
did
sue
wilbraham
for
a
hundred
million
dollars
for
breach
of
contract
securing
judgment
for
million
dollars
the
which
wilbraham
paid
before
leaving
the
departing
therefrom
with
a
balance
of
one
five
and
two
one
dollar
bills
to
the
good
and
that
is
why
my
dear
children
when
you
see
the
wilbraham
motor
chugging
along
the
highway
if
you
look
closely
you
will
see
painted
on
the
door
of
the
car
a
simple
crest
a
poached
egg
upon
a
piece
of
toast
and
underneath
it
in
golden
letters
on
a
scroll
the
family
motto
semper
iii
puss
the
promoter
once
upon
a
time
not
many
years
ago
my
children
there
was
a
captain
of
industry
who
at
his
death
had
no
other
legacy
to
leave
to
his
three
sons
than
fourteen
bank
accounts
all
of
them
overdrawn
a
couple
of
automobiles
without
any
tires
on
their
wheels
and
an
angora
cat
which
had
taken
several
prizes
at
the
annual
cat
show
in
new
york
and
upon
more
than
one
occasion
had
had
its
picture
printed
in
the
society
columns
of
the
sunday
newspapers
the
eldest
son
took
over
the
bank
accounts
and
by
the
negotiation
of
several
large
checks
among
his
friends
each
one
dated
several
months
ahead
had
managed
to
escape
to
venezuela
with
a
comfortable
fortune
where
after
several
revolutions
he
found
himself
in
the
cabinet
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
further
enriched
himself
in
this
office
by
the
private
sale
of
national
bonds
to
innocent
investors
prior
to
his
departure
for
algiers
and
became
before
his
death
a
leading
spirit
in
that
interesting
colony
and
an
influential
member
of
the
missionary
society
of
east
africa
the
second
son
took
the
automobiles
and
with
a
pot
of
paint
and
eight
old
relics
of
the
palmy
days
when
his
father
was
a
famous
yachtsman
so
furbished
them
up
that
he
was
able
to
sell
them
to
a
couple
of
farmers
in
central
connecticut
for
five
thousand
dollars
which
he
invested
in
steel
common
when
it
was
sulking
along
between
and
on
a
margin
of
five
per
and
selling
out
at
he
was
soon
able
to
retire
to
the
serene
joys
and
quiet
pleasures
of
the
great
white
way
along
whose
verdured
slopes
he
pranked
and
played
until
paresis
called
him
at
the
ripe
age
of
years
but
to
the
youngest
son
poor
jack
dinwiddie
by
the
terms
of
his
father
will
fell
only
the
residue
of
the
estate
after
the
two
brothers
had
had
their
shares
in
other
words
the
angora
cat
it
was
indeed
a
melancholy
situation
for
poor
jack
like
a
great
many
other
sons
of
men
of
presumably
large
wealth
had
studied
only
political
economy
at
college
and
of
the
domestic
variety
knew
nothing
he
was
an
honorary
member
of
the
consumers
league
but
of
the
methods
of
the
producers
union
he
knew
little
and
here
at
the
age
of
he
found
himself
fatherless
penniless
and
without
any
visible
means
of
support
in
the
line
of
earning
capacity
well
puss
he
said
gloomily
as
he
gazed
at
his
angora
cat
who
was
sitting
on
top
of
a
pile
of
unpaid
bills
in
jack
bachelor
apartment
washing
his
face
with
his
right
paw
it
looks
to
me
as
if
we
were
up
against
it
the
governor
has
gone
to
his
last
account
my
allowance
has
ceased
and
you
are
the
only
clear
and
unencumbered
asset
in
my
possession
barring
this
last
cigarette
and
two
matches
loaned
to
me
by
a
kind
gentleman
upon
the
street
to
whom
i
applied
recently
for
a
light
he
paused
and
lit
the
cigarette
while
puss
unmindful
of
the
pathos
of
the
situation
continued
his
prinking
giving
especial
attention
to
his
whiskers
brushing
them
upward
from
his
lips
until
he
bore
a
not
very
remote
resemblance
to
the
kaiser

the
young
man
went
on
angora
cats
with
a
pedigree
dating
back
to
dick
whittington
time
and
a
bunch
of
blue
ribbons
big
enough
to
supply
every
prohibitionist
in
the
union
with
a
bowknot
for
the
lapel
of
his
coat
must
have
some
market
value
especially
in
a
time
like
this
when
anything
resembling
beef
is
worth
its
weight
in
radium
but
i
wo
do
it
old
man
you
been
a
mighty
good
cat
to
me
and
as
long
as
there
is
a
drop
of
chalk
and
water
left
in
this
world
you
shall
have
your
morning
dish
of
milk
it
was
then
that
a
very
singular
thing
happened
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
jack
purred
the
cat
jumping
to
the
floor
and
rubbing
his
sleek
sides
up
against
his
master
leg
affectionately
if
we
are
not
to
be
separated
it
is
up
to
me
to
show
myself
the
worthy
descendant
of
a
noble
and
resourceful
ancestry
there
is
a
tradition
in
our
family
that
no
backyard
fence
has
ever
been
so
hard
to
climb
that
we
could
get
over
it
do
you
know
who
i
am
why
yes
said
jack
rubbing
his
eyes
in
astonishment
for
he
had
never
heard
the
cat
speak
before
you
are
angora
bill
the
champion
chinchilla
of
fourteen
consecutive
annual
shows
and
the
neatest
little
ratter
that
ever
lived
i
am
more
than
that
replied
the
cat
proudly
i
am
the
direct
lineal
descendant
of
the
original
puss
in
boots
and
one
of
the
advance
agents
of
prosperity
jacked
laughed
even
in
his
misery
those
days
have
gone
puss
he
said
wearily
there
are
no
longer
any
fairies
to
help
poor
beggars
like
me
out
of
a
hole
bill
that
what
you
think
smiled
puss
scratching
his
left
ear
with
his
right
but
my
dear
boy
my
was
a
piker
alongside
of
myself
who
all
unknown
to
you
am
one
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
united
states
fairy
company
of
wall
street
new
york
if
you
will
do
just
what
i
tell
you
my
boy
we
shall
emerge
from
this
little
embarrassment
of
ours
with
flying
colors
and
spend
our
declining
years
in
a
little
onyx
bungalow
on
the
corner
of
bond
avenue
and
easy
street
that
will
make
the
vandergilt
palace
up
on
the
plaza
look
like
a
particularly
cheap
and
jack
gazed
mournfully
at
his
companion
surely
he
thought
our
misfortunes
have
driven
him
crazy
nevertheless
he
decided
to
humor
the
creature
what
would
you
have
me
do
puss
he
asked
nothing
much
replied
the
cat
just
pack
your
with
your
few
remaining
collars
and
other
garments
fill
your
five
trunks
with
sunday
newspapers
and
unpaid
bills
and
move
at
once
into
the
taking
a
suite
of
five
rooms
and
a
bath
on
nothing
demanded
the
astonished
youth
you
lose
less
on
nothing
than
you
would
if
you
had
something
to
lose
retorted
puss
with
a
wise
air
do
as
i
say
lend
me
a
pair
of
your
boots
a
derby
hat
and
your
ulster
and
wait
for
me
in
your
apartment
go
at
once
to
the
hotel
register
and
ask
if
there
are
any
letters
or
messages
for
you
and
all
will
be
well
you
might
register
as
horace
vanderpoel
of
cincinnati
or
louis
or
any
other
old
place
at
a
comfortable
distance
from
new
york
let
your
luggage
precede
you
the
cat
spoke
in
a
masterful
tone
that
inspired
confidence
as
he
delivered
his
instructions
he
donned
his
master
boots
and
overcoat
and
then
putting
the
derby
hat
jauntily
upon
his
head
he
sauntered
forth
jack
he
said
as
he
reached
the
door
follow
my
instructions
to
the
very
last
detail
and
before
long
you
be
wearing
diamonds
that
will
make
the
average
incandescent
electric
light
look
like
an
eclipse
now
jack
was
a
venturesome
youth
and
ready
at
all
times
for
any
kind
of
an
unusual
experience
so
deeply
impressed
by
the
mere
fact
of
the
cat
having
spoken
at
all
he
decided
to
follow
out
his
instructions
to
the
letter
his
five
trunks
filled
to
the
brim
with
papers
and
bills
and
any
other
objects
of
that
came
handy
were
dispatched
at
once
to
the
waldorf
and
in
about
three
hours
he
himself
followed
them
registering
in
a
large
bold
hand
as
horace
vanderpoel
of
kansas
city
in
the
hotel
book
i
want
a
suite
of
five
rooms
and
a
bath
said
jack
certainly
vanderpoel
said
the
courteously
we
had
already
made
a
reservation
for
you
sir
we
will
give
you
suite
number
on
the
first
floor
good
said
jack
i
was
aware
that
my
coming
had
been
heralded
in
fact
i
have
been
wanting
to
have
it
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
important
negotiations
you
know
we
quite
understand
vanderpoel
said
the
clerk
have
any
letters
or
telephone
messages
been
received
for
me
jack
demanded
no
letters
sir
replied
the
clerk
but
rockernegie
secretary
us
about
an
hour
ago
requesting
us
to
ask
you
to
let
him
know
the
minute

arrived
fact
is
sir
that
is
how
we
came
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
you
rockernegie
eh
said
jack
scratching
his
head
with
a
puzzled
air
well
he
added
with
a
laugh
i
guess
he
can
wait
a
bit
have
midas
rung
me
up
yet
not
yet
sir
said
the
clerk
well
i
going
to
be
shaved
said
jack
if
midas
does
ring
me
up
let
me
know
he
chuckled
as
he
went
down
to
the
bill
is
a
great
cat
he
muttered
to
himself
rockernegie
gee
here
hoping
he
wo
forget
midas
and
bondifeller
he
sat
down
in
the
barber
chair
and
was
soon
richly
lathered
the
barber
was
about
to
apply
the
razor
when
a
small
boy
clad
in
a
perfect
rash
of
buttons
entered
the
shop
number
please
he
cried
gentleman
number
wait
a
minute
barber
said
jack
that

number

the
telephone

said
the
boy

jack
impatiently
yes

said
the
boy
i

they
told
me
to
tell
you

that
bondifeller
was
on
the
sir
illustration

bondifeller
that

am
too

grinned
jack
well
you
tell
to
tell
bondifeller
that
i
am
too
busy
just
at
present
to
see
him
you
might
tell
him
too
that
i
have
anything
to
add
to
what
i
said
in
my
last
letter
if
he
does
like
that
the
deal
is
off
there
was
a
considerable
craning
of
necks
in
the
neighboring
chairs
for
jack
had
not
thought
to
address
his
remarks
to
the
lad
in
tones
suggestive
of
a
confidential
communication
the
boy
staggered
slightly
on
his
feet
but
managed
to
get
away
without
dropping
under
the
weight
of
such
a
message
and
jack
lying
back
in
his
chair
requested
the
barber
to
proceed
bill
is
a
great
cat
he
chuckled
beg
pardon
queried
the
barber
i
say
do
shave
me
too
close
said
jack
the
shave
over
jack
retired
to
his
apartment
and
found
in
suite
number
everything
that
the
heart
of
man
could
desire
and
throughout
the
great
caravansary
the
name
of
horace
vanderpoel
was
held
in
high
honor
to
be
sure
they
had
never
heard
of
him
before
but
the
associate
of
these
brilliant
dignitaries
of
the
financial
world
must
indeed
be
somebody
even
in
new
york
here
he
sat
awaiting
developments
his
amusement
as
well
as
his
interest
in
the
adventure
increasing
momentarily
an
hour
passed
and
then
a
card
was
brought
to
his
door
bearing
the
mystic
words
colonel
gora
the
catskill
club
ask
colonel
gora
to
come
right
up
said
jack
with
difficulty
repressing
the
guffaw
that
struggled
within
him
for
expression
recognizing
the
name
at
once
five
minutes
later
puss
walked
in
the
perfect
picture
of
a
military
dandy
largely
due
no
doubt
to
the
cut
of
his
whiskers
well
he
said
removing
his
gloves
and
out
of
sheer
force
of
habit
proceeding
to
wash
his
face
with
his
right
paw
you
seem
to
be
pretty
comfortably
located
in
the
lap
of
luxury
grinned
jack
puss
face
grew
solemn
for
a
cat
my
dear
jack
or
rather
horace
he
said
the
lap
of
luxury
would
be
a
saucer
of
milk
you
shall
have
a
pitcherful
bill
cried
jack
rushing
to
the
not
on
your
life
my
dear
boy
meowed
puss
excitedly
stopping
him
never
the
occupant
of
an
apartment
like
this
ordering
a
pitcher
of
milk
why
my
dear
fellow
that
would
queer
our
game
at
the
very
start
order
some
tea
and
i
drink
the
cream
after
regaling
himself
on
the
refreshment
provided
by
the
confiding
management
puss
with
a
graceful
readjustment
of
his
whiskers
turned
with
a
smile
to
the
wondering
and
admiring
beneficiary
of
his
resourceful
mind
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
jack
he
asked
it
is
very
nice
indeed
puss
jack
answered
but
er
i
ca
help
thinking
of
the
possibilities
of
the
day
of
reckoning
who
going
to
pay
for
all
this
when
the
bill
comes
in
don
t
worry
said
puss
i
attend
to
all
that
this
afternoon
i
want
you
to
climb
aboard
the
coach
that
leaves
madison
square
at
three
sit
next
to
the
young
lady
with
blue
eyes
and
a
persian
lamb
ulster
whom
you
will
find
occupying
the
front
seat
with
her
father
a
large
stout
gentleman
with
a
kohinoor
sparkling
like
an
electric
light
in
his
and
three
more
on
his
little
finger
if
you
happen
to
see
me
on
the
same
coach
do
let
on
that
you
know
me
and
above
all
do
deny
anything

may
hear
anybody
saying
about
you

you
register
from
kansas
city
replied
jack
illustration
jack
all
right
said
puss
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
my
boy
and
all
will
be
well
like
most
cats
i
have
a
few
fences
to
take
care
of
this
afternoon
and
i
must
be
off
i
found
a
nice
little
kitten
up
the
street
who
is
going
to
manicure
my
nails
with
these
words
the
amazing
creature
donned
his
hat
and
coat
and
resuming
his
boots
strode
out
with
a
magnificent
swagger
at
three
in
the
afternoon
jack
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
boarded
the
coach
at
madison
square
and
recognizing
the
young
woman
referred
to
by
puss
sitting
on
the
front
seat
of
the
car
seated
himself
beside
her
when
do
we
start
popper
asked
the
girl
with
a
demure
glance
at
jack
putty

the
old

sat
on
her
other
side
but
there

never
any
tellin

new
york
guys

things
putty
much
as
they
please
humph
muttered
jack
under
his
breath
he
sounds
like
real
money
from
goldfields
in
a
few
moments
the
car
started
and
as
they
passed
around
the
flatiron
building
jack
was
still
further
amazed
to
recognize
in
the
voice
of
the
lecturer
none
other
than
that
of
the
faithful
puss
this
building
jack
heard
him
saying
boldly
is
the
famous
flatiron
building
erected
at
great
expense
by
the
fuller
company
and
lately
purchased
for
five
million
dollars
by
the
famous
missouri

and

continued
puss
bellowing
his
words
into
jack
ears
playfully
through
his
megaphone
while
off
across
the
square
to
the
north
the
structure
in
yellow
brick
is
the
famous
madison

garden
soon
to
be
torn
down
to

containing

laughed
puss
it
is
said
that
he
is
trying
to
buy
a
controlling
interest
in
the
whole
city
negotiating
for

gasped
the
what

going
to
do
with
it
when

replied
puss
gayly
kind
of
suspect
he
thinking
of
annexing
it
to
kansas

sir
the
car
proceeded
until
the
party
reached

millions
and

gasped
the
young
woman
father
and
jack
indorsed
the
observation
unreservedly
that
a
pretty
house
popper
said
the
young
woman
as
the
car
reached
the
street
entrance
to
the
park
pointing
toward
rockernegie
residence
formerly
the
residence
of
andrew
rockernegie
said
puss
but
recently
sold
to
vanderpoel
for
three
million
dollars
it
mighty
funny
i
never
heard
of
this
vanderpoel
feller
before
said
the
old
man
just
come
into
his
fortune
sir
vouchsafed
puss
very
young
man
just
come
of
age
sir
the
old
man
leaned
forward
and
addressing
jack
inquired
did
you
ever
hear
of
this
man
vanderpoel
young
man
well
yes
said
jack
with
a
modest
laugh
fact
is
myself
am
horace
the
stranger
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
well
by
ginger
he
said
i
i
i
to
meet
you
sir
this
is
my
daughter
amanda
sir
i
i
i
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
sir
said
jack
pleasantly
removing
his
hat
and
bowing
to
the
young
woman
you
are
dobbins
sir
returned
the
old
man
effusively
joshua
dobbins
i
thought
i
was
going
some
on
the
money
question
with
seven
gold
mines
in
nevada
but
i
must
take
off
my
hat
to
you
sir
any
man
who
has
the
nerve
to
buy
new
york
heavens
the
old
fellow
took
off
his
hat
and
mopped
his
brow
which
had
begun
to
perspire
freely
oh
i
do
take
any
credit
to
myself
for
that
said
jack
modestly
when
a
boy
has
a
who
dies
and
leaves
forty
million
dollars
to
him
in
trust
for
fifty
years
before
he
was
born
and
that
money
accumulates
until
the
unborn
beneficiary
is
years
old
it
means
a
rather
tidy
stockingful
i
admit
but
it
is
as
if
i
made
the
money
myself
million
accumulating
interest
for
years
gasped
dobbins
compound
said
jack
smiling
sweetly
at
the
girl
at
his
side
the
deuce
of
it
i
i
got
to
do
something
to
keep
the
income
invested
and
new
york
real
estate
being
the
most
expensive
thing
in
sight
i
gone
in
for
that
as
being
the
easiest
way
out
i
i
suppose
you
are
living
here
now
asked
dobbins
no
said
jack
personally
i
do
care
particularly
for
new
york
i
am
just
in
town
for
a
few
days
stopping
at
the
waldorf
why
so
are
we
interrupted
the
girl
then
said
jack
gallantly
the
waldorf
possesses
even
greater
attractions
than
i
had
supposed
the
girl
blushed
a
rosy
red
and
the
old
gentleman
fairly
beamed
glad
to
have
you
take
dinner
with
us
vanderpoel
he
said
thank
you
said
jack
i
shall
be
charmed
to
do
so
if
i
can
i
sort
of
half
promised
bondifeller
to
take
a
snack
with
him
this
evening
but
this
with
a
killing
glance
at
the
blushing
miss
dobbins
but
i
guess
he
can
wait
to
tell
you
the
truth
dobbins
these
new
york
millionaires
bore
me
to
death
at
what
time
shall
we
foregather
suppose
we
say
seven
said
the
old
gentleman
my
lucky
number
said
jack
with
a
gracious
smile
which
set
the
heart
of
miss
dobbins
all
of
so
passed
the
hours
away
jack
found
himself
growing
momentarily
more
deeply
impressed
with
the
beauty
of
the
maiden
at
his
side
and
by
the
time
the
young
people
had
reached
the
hotel
it
had
become
a
pronounced
case
of
pure
and
ardent
love
as
they
entered
the
waldorf
one
of
the
employees
of
the
hotel
rushed
excitedly
up
to
the
young
billionaire
breathless
with
the
importance
of
a
communication
intrusted
to
him
rockernegie
is
on
the
wire
wants
to
speak
to
you
immediately
sir
he
panted
tell
him
i
busy
said
jack
entering
the
and
ordering
a
slight
repast
for
miss
dobbins
and
her
father
a
moment
later
the
messenger
returned
more
breathless
than
before
sorry
sir
said
the
boy
but
rockernegie
says
he
must
see
you
right
away
sir
jack
frowned
as
though
deeply
annoyed
and
his
answer
came
with
an
incisive
coldness
that
froze
dobbins
almost
to
the
marrow
go
back
to
that
and
tell
the
gentleman
that
it
will
take
the
biggest
in
the
amalgamated
navies
of
the
world
to
enable
him
to
get
even
a
view
of
me
until
i
get
good
and
ready
he
said
er
tell
him
he
can
come
to
my
office
at
morning
if
he
wants
to
only
he
must
be
late
just
impress
that
on
his
mind
dobbins
choked
and
coughed
apoplectically
do
let
us
interfere
with
any
of
your
engagements
vanderpoel
he
sputtered
that
all
right
dobbins
said
jack
i
wish
you
invest
seven
or
eight
million
for
me
said
dobbins
with
a
sheepish
glance
at
jack
i
know
it
is
much
but
risky
business
speculating
dobbins
said
jack
bravely
although
the
suggestion
had
nearly
knocked
him
off
his
chair
better
hang
on
to
your
pennies
now
that
you
got
oh
i
got
eight
or
ten
more
where
they
came
from
chuckled
the
old
man
then
sir
said
jack
as
calmly
as
he
knew
how
the
best
investment
for
you
is
in
miss
amanda
dobbins
preferred
a
stock
of
priceless
value
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
said
the
old
man
scratching
his
head
in
perplexity
settle
five
million
on
your
daughter
explained
jack
when
you
got
her
fixed
comfortably
in
life
go
in
and
do
as
you
please
with
the
rest
of
your
fortune
play
the
game
as
hard
as
you
like
and
win
or
lose
no
harm
can
come
to
her
and
you
lose
why
she
be
able
to
take
care
of
you
i
already
given
her
four
million
have
i
amandy
said
the
old
gentleman
proudly
yes
popper
said
the
girl
and
jack
heart
began
to
play
the
anvil
chorus
on
the
xylophone
of
his
ribs
what
a
chance
how
about
it
vanderpoel
persisted
the
old
man
can
you
put
me
wise
oh
well
said
jack
if
you
really
insist
i
let
you
into
a
little
blind
pool
i
in
but
not
for
very
much
say
a
couple
of
millions
only
i
wo
take
a
penny
of
your
money
if
you
are
like
all
the
rest
of
these
people
here
who
want
to
be
shown
how
things
are
every
five
minutes
of
the
day
i
take
your
two
million
and
you
can
call
it
a
loan
if
you
want
to
your
receipt
will
be
my
demand
note
for
the
full
amount
you
see
i
know
what
i
about
and
i
careful
illustration
could
make
it
three
million
could
you
suggested
dobbins
could
make
it
three
million
could
you
suggested
dobbins
with
a
pleading
note
in
his
voice
which
jack
found
difficult
to
resist
i
happen
to
have
that
amount
idle
well
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
jack
patronizingly
i
was
going
to
pull
this
thing
off
myself
because
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
left
in
this
world
but
first
the
midas
people
butted
in
then
bondifeller
wanted
a
slice
and
rockernegie
wore
out
his
library
carpet
running
to
the
to
ring
me
up
about
it
until
i
told
central
i
have
the
company
indicted
as
a
nuisance
if
they
let
the
old
man
have
my
number
again
none
the
less
for
merely
diplomatic
reasons
i
going
to
let
all
in
for
a
small
share
just
enough
to
keep
them
satisfied
with
themselves
exactly
what
the
basis
will
be
i
have
yet
decided
but
if
you
are
willing
to
take
your
chances
with
them
well
you
may
hand
me
six
certified
checks
for
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
apiece
so
that
i
can
spread
the
whole
amount
around
in
my
various
bank
and
trust
company
accounts
now
what
puss
asked
jack
the
next
afternoon
as
he
and
his
feline
friend
held
a
consultation
in
the
apartment
i
got
three
million
to
my
credit
in
six
banks
what
the
next
step
algiers
or
venezuela
why
said
puss
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
with
three
million
in
hand
can
afford
to
stay
in
new
york
over
christmas
anyhow
yes
i
know
said
jack
but
the
old
man
he
got
to
have
some
profit
some
time
or
other
has
he
puss
sighed
deeply
it
is
very
evident
my
dear
jack
said
he
that
you
are
no
financier
settle
a
million
on
yourself
and
use
the
remainder
to
pay
dividends
to
dobbins
he
probably
think
per
cent
on
his
investment
was
a
pretty
fair
return
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
you
give
him
back
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
he
be
satisfied
then
if
you
hand
him
over
a
full
million
the
second
year
well
well
what
gasped
jack
he
put
five
million
more
into
the
pool
on
your
mere
intimation
that
you
are
willing
to
help
him
out
to
that
extent
said
puss
which
will
keep
you
going
several
years
longer
jack
breathed
heavily
at
the
prospect
of
such
affluence
but
he
could
not
escape
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
there
would
be
an
inevitable
day
of
reckoning
ahead
of
him
and
when
that
is
gone
he
asked
puss
gazed
at
him
scornfully
this
time
my
but
you
are
stupid
he
ejaculated
i
really
want
to
help
you
jack
but
i
ca
do
everything
you
know
you
got
to
handle
some
of
this
business
yourself
but
let
me
ask
you
one
question
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
millionaire
putting
the
father
of
his
grandchildren
in
jail
because
he
had
lost
money
in
a
blind
speculation
no
i
never
did
said
jack
but
you
see
puss
i
am
not
the
father
of
dobbins
grandchildren
no
said
puss
but
why
in
thunder
should
you
not
be
by
jove
cried
jack
joyously
do
you
think
she
have
me
will
a
duck
quack
asked
the
cat
extract
from
the
last
will
and
testament
of
joshua
dobbins
and
i
do
hereby
appoint
my
said
horace
vanderpoel
husband
of
my
beloved
daughter
amanda
sole
trustee
of
my
estate
without
bond
said
estate
to
be
administered
by
him
for
the
benefit
of
my
said
daughter
amanda
and
her
children
according
to
his
own
discretion
for
which
service
in
lieu
of
executor
or
trust
fees
i
do
hereby
give
bequeath
and
devise
to
his
use
forever
the
sum
of
five
million
dollars
together
with
such
additional
sums
as
i
have
from
time
to
time
during
the
past
four
years
invested
under
his
advice
and
direction
in
the
several
properties
in
his
control
both
principal
and
interest
accrued
up
to
the
date
of
my
decease
dear
old
dad
said
jack
when
the
will
had
been
read
your
father
was
a
fine
man
amanda
dear
and
a
very
successful
man
as
well
yes
horace
said
his
weeping
wife
but
he
always
insisted
that
he
owed
much
to
your
splendid
business
management
so
after
all
you
have
only
come
into
your
own
dear
ah
well
said
jack
as
he
opened
a
fresh
bottle
of
cream
and
placed
it
before
his
pet
angora
money
is
everything
sweetheart
and
i
should
have
been
satisfied
if
he
had
left
me
nothing
but
you
and
the
angora
cat
wiped
off
the
back
of
his
ear
with
his
left
paw
and
twirled
his
mustachios
upward
with
a
wave
of
his
right
as
he
purred
amiably
over
the
cream
iv
the
golden
fleece
there
was
once
a
miller
who
was
very
poor
but
he
had
a
beautiful
daughter
there
were
a
great
many
people
who
said
that
if
he
had
not
had
so
beautiful
a
daughter
he
would
not
have
been
so
poor
and
it
may
be
that
these
were
right
for
beautiful
daughters
are
not
infrequently
a
source
of
considerable
expense
to
their
parents
and
i
fear
me
that
gasmerilda
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
she
had
a
great
passion
for
rare
furs
and
for
opera
and
lingerie
cloaks
and
the
thousand
and
one
other
dainty
things
that
appeal
to
the
heart
of
beautiful
young
maidenhood
and
it
seemed
to
make
no
difference
how
many
millions
of
bushels
of
corn
passed
through
her
father
mill
day
after
day
the
returns
from
the
grinding
wheels
were
always
thirty
or
forty
dollars
a
month
lower
than
the
total
aggregate
of
bills
from
milliners
furriers
jewelers
and
others
too
numerous
to
mention
of
course
this
thing
could
not
go
on
indefinitely
there
comes
a
time
when
even
the
blindest
of
creditors
will
insist
upon
the
liquidation
of
a
miller
account
and
the
poor
man
found
himself
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
debt
as
the
months
passed
along
and
was
now
at
last
at
his
wits
ends
to
devise
new
excuses
for
the
of
indebtedness
indeed
he
had
now
come
to
a
point
where
there
was
but
one
refuge
from
the
ultimate
of
financial
disaster
that
should
force
him
into
a
public
declaration
of
his
bankruptcy
and
that
was
to
be
seen
associating
in
public
places
with
malefactors
of
great
wealth
what
awful
agony
of
mind
this
cost
him
for
he
was
an
honest
miller
as
had
always
been
evidenced
by
his
willingness
to
promise
to
pay
his
debts
even
when
he
knew
he
could
not
the
world
will
never
know
but
he
swallowed
his
pride
and
for
a
time
gained
immunity
from
the
pressure
of
his
creditors
with
their
threatened
judgments
by
being
seen
walking
down
fifth
avenue
in
the
morning
alongside
of
colonel
john
midas
the
president
of
the
pactolean
trust
company
a
savings
institution
formed
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
lending
its
depositors
money
to
members
of
its
own
board
of
directors
taking
their
checks
dated
two
months
ahead
and
indorsed
by
their
and
stenographers
for
security
it
is
true
that
anybody
who
was
ever
seen
speaking
to
colonel
midas
in
public
was
by
orders
of
the
district
attorney
immediately
by
the
secret
service
camera
squad
attached
to
that
gentleman
office
and
the
resulting
negatives
filed
away
for
future
reference
in
case
justice
should
ever
by
some
odd
chance
peep
over
the
top
of
her
bandage
for
a
moment
and
fix
her
eagle
eye
upon
the
colonel
doings
but
on
the
other
hand
there
were
countless
thousands
of
worthy
people
and
among
them
were
the
miller
creditors
who
believed
that
association
with
such
a
person
as
colonel
midas
was
pretty
good
evidence
either
of
a
man
solvency
or
of
his
immunity
to
the
lash
of
the
law
consequently
when
for
five
successive
mornings
the
furriers
the
jewelers
the
milliners
and
others
to
whom
the
unfortunate
miller
owed
vast
unpayable
sums
of
money
for
sundries
purchased
from
time
to
time
by
the
beautiful
gasmerilda
saw
their
debtor
walking
alongside
of
the
great
pactolean
magnate
they
called
off
their
collectors
and
attorneys
and
sent
the
beautiful
girl
extra
notifications
through
the
mails
of
their
new
fall
and
winter
importations
to
which
in
due
course
of
time
the
lovely
maid
responded
to
the
consequent
swelling
of
the
already
accounts
due
if
these
persons
had
only
known
that
these
walks
upon
the
avenue
were
silent
walks
and
that
from
the
plaza
down
to
madison
square
colonel
midas
though
accompanied
by
the
miller
was
utterly
unaware
of
the
latter
presence
being
too
deeply
absorbed
in
certain
operations
of
great
magnitude
upon
the
street
to
notice
anything
that
was
going
on
around
him
they
would
doubtless
have
acted
differently
but
they
did
not
know
this
and
it
soon
passed
about
among
the
tradesmen
that
the
miller
was
the
friend
of
midas
and
thereby
was
his
credit
greatly
expanded
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
promenade
however
colonel
midas
having
solved
the
particular
problem
upon
which
his
mind
had
been
set
for
the
past
week
or
ten
days
became
more
observant
and
after
the
miller
had
walked
at
his
side
for
several
blocks
he
remarked
the
fact
and
with
emotions
that
were
not
altogether
pleasant
wherefore
he
quickened
his
footsteps
in
order
that
he
might
leave
the
intruder
behind
but
the
miller
quickened
his
also
and
remained
alongside
colonel
midas
stopped
short
in
his
walk
before
an
window
and
gazed
in
at
the
paintings
therein
displayed
the
miller
likewise
his
head
cocked
knowingly
to
one
side
like
that
of
a
connoisseur
paused
and
gazed
in
at
the
marvels
of
the
brush
the
colonel
with
a
sudden
jerky
turn
leaped
from
the
window
to
the
and
boarded
a
moving
omnibus
with
surprising
agility
for
a
man
of
his
years
but
he
was
not
too
quick
for
his
pursuer
for
the
miller
though
scarcely
able
to
afford
the
expense
immediately
sprang
aboard
the
same
vehicle
and
took
the
seat
beside
him
then
for
the
first
time
the
colonel
addressed
him
and
there
being
no
ladies
upon
the
omnibus
at
that
early
hour
in
terms
rather
more
forcible
than
polite
illustration
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
he
demanded
frowning
upon
his
pursuer
riding
in
a
replied
the
miller
with
a
pleasant
smile
are
you
trying
to
shadow
me
roared
the
colonel
i
make
a
mighty
poor
eclipse
for
you
colonel
midas
said
the
miller
suavely
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
added
a
sudden
idea
having
flashed
across
his
mind
which
in
the
absence
of
anything
else
to
say
in
explanation
of
his
conduct
seemed
as
good
as
any
other
excuse
he
could
invent
there
a
little
matter
i
like
to
bring
to
your
attention
bombs
asked
the
colonel
moving
away
apprehensively
noticing
that
the
miller
had
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
fearing
that
he
had
perhaps
encountered
a
crank
who
designed
to
do
him
harm
no
indeed
laughed
the
miller
not
in
such
close
quarters
as
this
when
i
throw
a
bomb
at
anybody
i
shall
take
care
to
provide
a
safety
net
for
myself
ha
ejaculated
the
colonel
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
nothing
in
it
said
the
miller
work
too
heavy
for
the
profits
no
sir
i
am
neither
a
nor
an
anarchist
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor
miller
with
an
ingrowing
income
but
i
have
a
beautiful
daughter
who
oh
yes
interrupted
midas
with
a
nod
i
remember
now
i
heard
of
you
you
preferred
to
remain
independent
instead
of
selling
out
to
the
trust
you
tried
to
discount
some
of
your
notes
at
the
pactolean
trust
company
of
which
i
am
president
the
other
day
yes
said
the
miller
and
you
refused
them
naturally
laughed
midas
a
beautiful
daughter
miller
is
a
lovely
possession
but
she
mighty
poor
security
for
a
loan
about
the
worst
in
the
market
especially
yours
i
seen
miss
miller
at
the
opera
several
times
and
have
wondered
how
you
managed
it
it
would
cost
more
than
the
face
value
of
your
notes
to
support
the
security
for
one
week
in
the
style
to
which
she
is
accustomed
that
true
enough
said
the
miller
and
nobody
knows
it
better
than
i
do
nevertheless
you
made
a
mistake
you
have
possibly
never
heard
of
her
wonderful
gift
no
said
the
magnate
i
was
not
aware
that
the
young
lady
had
any
other
gifts
than
beauty
and
a
father
with
a
little
credit
left
well
be
that
as
it
may
retorted
the
miller
she
has
one
great
gift
she
can
spin
straw
into
gold
what
cried
midas
becoming
interested
at
once
yes
sir
the
miller
went
on
she
has
marvellous
powers
in
that
direction
if
she
had
i
have
been
up
a
tree
long
ago
i
had
heard
of
her
father
ability
to
turn
hot
air
into
russian
sables
and
diamond
necklaces
but
this
straw
business
is
something
new
said
midas
i
thought
you
would
so
regard
it
said
the
miller
confidently
and
that
is
why
i
have
been
trying
to
get
a
word
with
you
for
the
past
week
you
are
the
only
man
i
know
in
the
financial
world
who
is
known
to
have
the
enterprise
and
the
courage
to
go
into
a
little
gamble
that
other
people
would
laugh
at
you
have
that
prime
quality
of
success
colonel
midas
that
is
known
to
mankind
as
nerve
you
are
always
willing
to
sit
in
any
kind
of
a
game
that
shows
a
glimmer
of
profit
in
the
perspective
and
that
is
why
i
bring
this
matter
to
you
instead
of
to
my
friend
rockernegie
a
man
utterly
without
imagination
and
blind
to
many
a
sure
thing
because
he
ca
understand
it
the
colonel
who
was
not
unsusceptible
to
flattery
was
visibly
impressed
by
this
tribute
he
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
see
here
miller
he
said
after
a
brief
communion
with
himself
if
this
story
is
true
why
are
you
trying
to
discount
your
notes
at
the
pactolean
trust
company
why
do
you
get
a
bale
of
straw
and
have
your
daughter
turn
it
over
a
few
times
i
will
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
colonel
said
the
miller
it
is
a
humiliating
confession
to
make
sir
but
i
everlastingly
busted
just
plain
down
and
out
and
i
could
buy
a
lemonade
straw
if
they
were
going
at
a
cent
a
ton
much
less
a
bale
the
colonel
looked
at
him
sympathetically
and
then
giving
his
knee
a
resounding
whack
he
cried
by
jove
miller
i
back
you
i
rather
like
your
nerve
and
as
you
have
so
charmingly
put
it
i
the
sort
of
man
to
take
a
long
shot
yes
sir
and
i
would
have
had
seven
cents
to
my
name
if
i
had
been
come
with
me
to
the
pactolean
trust
company
and
we
discount
your
demand
note
suitably
indorsed
right
off
with
the
understanding
however
that
your
daughter
gives
us
an
immediate
demonstration
of
her
powers
we
furnish
the
straw
the
miller
heart
leaped
with
joy
but
he
deemed
it
well
not
to
show
himself
lest
he
lose
the
whole
advantage
it
is
very
good
of
you
colonel
he
observed
quietly
but
i
know
a
soul
in
this
bright
beautiful
world
who
would
indorse
my
note
for
any
sum
large
or
small
oh
that
will
be
all
right
laughed
the
colonel
we
got
a
rubber
stamp
in
the
office
for
just
such
emergencies
so
the
miller
and
his
friend
went
to
the
offices
of
the
pactolean
trust
company
where
in
a
short
while
he
found
relief
from
his
pressing
woes
by
the
exchange
of
his
demand
note
for
five
thousand
dollars
indorsed
most
appropriately
by
a
man
of
straw
for
four
crisp
treasury
notes
and
the
balance
less
six
interest
in
of
a
denomination
of
fifty
dollars
each
tell
your
daughter
to
come
down
here
morning
said
the
colonel
as
the
miller
pocketed
the
money
i
summon
the
board
of
directors
and
she
can
give
us
a
demonstration
of
her
gift
in
the
private
office
we
have
a
couple
of
bales
of
straw
all
ready
for
her
you
will
have
to
excuse
me
colonel
said
the
miller
with
that
calmness
which
a
man
is
likely
to
show
when
he
has
five
thousand
dollars
in
good
money
in
his
purse
but
that
will
be
impossible
gasmerilda
has
always
refused
to
exercise
her
gift
in
the
presence
of
anybody
else
and
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
make
no
exception
in
this
case
even
as
a
child
she
would
not
let
either
her
mother
or
myself
see
how
she
did
it
but
she
must
said
the
colonel
firmly
or
i
shall
be
under
the
painful
necessity
of
calling
that
note
at
once
illustration
there
the
money
sir
but
she
ca
returned
the
miller
you
see
sir
it
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
gift
that
she
must
be
alone
while
at
work
it
requires
such
intense
concentration
of
effort
if
you
insist
upon
her
presence
here
why
well
as
you
intimate
the
deal
is
off
between
us
and
i
shall
have
to
take
it
to
rockernegie
there
the
money
sir
with
a
supreme
effort
of
will
the
miller
tossed
the
roll
of
bills
back
upon
the
table
it
was
of
course
an
act
of
sheer
bravado
but
he
carried
it
off
so
well
that
it
worked
oh
very
well
said
the
colonel
gruffly
a
shade
of
disappointment
crossing
his
face
if
she
ca
she
ca
i
suppose
it
worth
a
try
anyhow
we
send
a
bale
of
straw
up
to
your
residence
this
afternoon
and
if
by
morning
she
has
managed
to
turn
it
into
gold
all
well
and
good
if
not
well
we
call
the
note
that
all
ca
you
make
it
a
week
pleaded
the
miller
she
may
have
some
other
engagement
on
for
and
er
well
a
week
will
give
her
time
to
turn
around
make
it
five
days
said
the
colonel
is
wednesday
let
her
make
the
delivery
on
monday
morning
done
said
the
miller
overjoyed
and
he
went
out
he
had
not
the
slightest
notion
in
the
world
how
his
beautiful
daughter
would
be
able
to
fulfil
the
agreement
indeed
he
was
fairly
certain
in
his
mind
that
she
would
be
able
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
but
he
had
the
use
of
five
thousand
dollars
at
a
critical
moment
in
his
career
and
he
knew
that
if
worst
came
to
worst
he
could
shave
off
his
mustache
and
thus
disguised
take
passage
for
europe
in
the
steerage
of
some
one
of
the
many
saturday
steamers
now
on
his
return
home
that
evening
the
miller
was
very
much
embarrassed
by
a
searching
inquiry
from
his
beautiful
daughter
it
seems
that
when
she
had
tried
to
telephone
to
one
of
her
friends
that
afternoon
she
had
been
informed
by
central
that
the
service
had
been
discontinued
for
of
the
bill
for
december
have
we
come
to
such
a
pass
as
that
father
she
demanded
her
lovely
voice
quivering
with
emotion
it
looks
like
it
said
the
miller
with
an
uneasy
laugh
i
have
been
kept
so
busy
paying
for
your
daily
supply
of
fresh
sables
that
i
had
a
moment
for
the
gas
bills
or
for
your
conversational
accounts
with
you
to
look
after
my
dear
i
find
that
even
talk
is
not
cheap
the
beautiful
girl
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
but
she
cried
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
must
have
eleven
hundred
and
seventy
dollars
and
cents
morning
father
or
i
shall
be
ruined
the
miller
heart
sank
within
him
and
his
face
grew
ashen
eleven
hundred
and
seventy
dollars
and
fuf
five
cents
he
stammered
in
heaven
name
what
for
gasmerilda
hairpins
no
father
she
trembled
i
have
issued
three
or
four
pounds
of
deferred
bridge
certificates
and
they
fall
due
you
certainly
do
not
wish
me
to
lose
my
social
position
about
the
only
thing
i
have
left
the
unhappy
man
gazed
long
and
anxiously
at
the
pale
face
before
him
and
then
his
heart
softened
as
it
always
had
done
all
right
my
child
he
sighed
as
he
tossed
the
exact
amount
to
her
across
the
table
then
his
face
grew
stern
gasmerilda
he
said
your
extravagance
having
brought
us
to
this
i
may
as
well
inform
you
now
as
at
any
other
time
that
it
is
up
to
you
to
get
us
out
of
trouble
and
i
have
been
forced
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
pactolean
trust
company
by
which
you
are
to
be
capitalized
hereafter
my
child
you
are
to
become
a
investment
instead
of
twin
sister
to
a
sinking
fund
what
can
you
mean
father
cried
the
girl
her
face
blanching
with
fear
the
miller
thereupon
recounted
to
her
in
full
detail
the
incidents
of
the
morning
and
revealed
to
her
astounded
mind
the
preposterous
claims
he
had
made
on
her
behalf
but
father
she
protested
i
have
no
such
gift
you
will
excuse
me
for
refusing
to
discuss
the
matter
further
with
you
gasmerilda
he
replied
coldly
if
it
so
happens
that
you
have
no
such
gift
you
must
devise
some
method
of
getting
it
i
have
given
my
word
and
as
a
dutiful
daughter
you
must
make
good
turning
to
the
butler
the
miller
asked
james
has
a
bale
of
straw
arrived
here
from
colonel
midas
yes
sir
said
the
butler
it
is
in
the
cellar
sir
good
said
the
miller
you
will
have
it
carried
up
to
miss
miller
at
once
rising
from
the
table
he
kissed
his
unhappy
daughter
affectionately
and
bidding
her
he
went
to
the
club
where
he
paid
his
delinquent
dues
and
house
charges
and
set
out
once
more
upon
a
tolerably
existence
for
five
days
at
least
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
paid
in
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
supply
of
red
and
blue
chips
illustration
poor
gasmerilda
sat
meanwhile
poor
gasmerilda
sat
and
eyes
wide
with
fear
and
perplexity
staring
at
that
horrible
bale
of
straw
that
occupied
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
her
dainty
boudoir
she
had
no
more
idea
of
how
to
spin
it
into
gold
than
she
had
of
making
over
her
last
year
gingham
into
this
year
opera
gown
hourly
her
distress
grew
until
finally
the
floodgates
of
her
tears
broke
and
she
burst
into
a
passionate
convulsion
of
weeping
but
even
as
the
tears
began
to
flow
there
came
a
faint
golden
tinkle
on
the
jeweled
that
stood
on
her
escritoire
at
first
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
unexpected
tintinnabulation
but
the
tinkling
soon
became
more
pronounced
and
so
persistent
that
she
finally
answered
it
is
that
you
gasmerilda
came
a
quaint
little
voice
over
the
wire
yes
she
sobbed
who
is
this
there
are
tears
in
your
voice
gasmerilda
came
the
quaint
little
voice
they
are
all
over
the
place
wept
the
unhappy
girl
illustration
i
am
your
fairy
godmother
gasmerilda
and
i
know
why
said
the
little
voice
sympathetically
i
am
your
fairy
godmother
gasmerilda
and
i
have
not
ceased
to
watch
over
you
your
father
has
negotiated
a
loan
on
your
remarkable
gift
of
spinning
straw
into
gold
has
he
not
yes
sobbed
gasmerilda
and
i
have
no
such
gift
well
do
worry
my
child
said
the
little
voice
when
you
were
a
baby
you
once
offered
a
part
of
your
school
orange
to
a
starving
kitten
and
she
has
not
forgotten
it
i
was
that
kitten
and
i
have
kept
my
eye
on
you
ever
since
and
now
i
am
going
to
help
you
out
if
you
will
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
do
all
will
be
well
gasmerilda
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
promised
to
be
faithful
to
her
fairy
godmother
instructions
oh
you
dear
she
cried
impulsively
go
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
said
the
fairy
godmother
to
the
united
states
assay
office
on
wall
street
taking
with
you
the
money
your
father
gave
you
this
evening
at
dinner
and
buy
a
bar
of
gold
but
fairy
godmother
gasmerilda
interrupted
i
i
must
use
that
money
to
pay
off
my
bridge
o
u
i
have
arranged
for
all
that
laughed
the
fairy
godmother
those
o
u
will
never
be
presented
transforming
myself
into
a
mouse
i
have
entered
the
escritoires
of
the
ladies
holding
your
notes
of
hand
and
have
eaten
every
single
one
of
them
gasmerilda
heart
leaped
with
joy
oh
fairy
godmother
she
cried
ca
you
get
rid
of
father
note
in
the
same
way
no
my
dear
sighed
the
little
voice
that
note
unfortunately
is
stored
away
in
a
steel
vault
and
my
teeth
are
not
strong
enough
to
nibble
through
that
i
have
a
more
method
to
get
you
both
out
of
your
troubles
after
you
have
purchased
the
bar
of
gold
take
it
home
with
you
and
devise
some
convenient
means
of
getting
rid
of
the
straw
without
anybody
seeing
you
do
it
the
best
way
to
do
this
will
be
to
carry
an
armful
of
it
at
a
time
up
on
to
the
roof
of
your
house
and
let
it
blow
away
and
then
when
next
monday
comes
and
your
father
is
required
to
deliver
the
first
consignment
of
the
precious
metal
to
colonel
midas
go
with
him
to
the
colonel
office
yourself
taking
the
gold
bar
with
you
and
see
that
it
is
really
delivered
wear
your
most
bewitching
hat
and
do
fail
to
remember
what
a
woman
eyes
were
given
her
for
oh
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
cried
gasmerilda
a
great
wave
of
happiness
sweeping
over
her
if
i
could
get
at
you
dear
fairy
godmother
over
the
i
should
hug
you
to
death
that
is
all
right
child
my
reward
will
come
later
replied
the
fairy
godmother
when
your
profits
begin
to
come
in
you
may
pay
me
a
commission
of
ten
per
cent
on
all
you
get
gladly
i
make
it
fifteen
per
cried
the
grateful
girl
but
how
shall
you
be
paid
by
check
dear
drawn
to
the
order
of
the
fairy
aid
society
of
america
of
which
i
am
the
president
was
the
answer
the
address
is
just
wall
street
new
york
and
now
sweet
dreams
my
beloved
ward
the
sun
of
your
troubles
has
set
and
the
dawn
of
prosperity
is
here
with
a
happy
smile
gasmerilda
wished
her
kindly
friend
and
retired
to
her
couch
and
slept
the
sleep
of
a
weary
child
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
with
her
little
purse
containing
the
necessary
funds
dangling
from
her
chatelaine
she
appeared
at
the
assay
office
and
purchased
there
a
shining
bar
of
the
lustrous
metal
returning
to
her
home
in
time
for
luncheon
well
daughter
said
the
miller
as
he
met
her
in
the
hallway
how
does
the
good
work
proceed
very
well
indeed
father
she
said
with
a
cheery
smile
i
a
little
out
of
practise
but
i
managed
to
spin
about
dollars
worth
last
night
before
going
to
bed
the
miller
blinked
amazedly
at
his
daughter
this
answer
was
indeed
the
most
extraordinary
substitute
for
the
floods
of
tears
he
had
expected
to
greet
his
question
you
you
you
dud
do
m
m
mean
to
sus
say
he
stammered
father
dear
did
you
ever
try
to
cut
jelly
with
a
steel
knife
she
asked
yes
child
yes
but
what
of
that
he
demanded
completely
nonplussed
well
dear
she
answered
kissing
him
on
the
tip
end
of
his
nose
that
is
hard
labor
compared
to
spinning
gold
out
of
straw
she
ran
from
him
laughing
merrily
as
she
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
her
room
while
he
staggering
back
against
the
of
the
staircase
leaned
on
it
breathing
heavily
if
that
the
case
he
said
as
with
trembling
hands
he
took
a
set
of
false
whiskers
and
a
steerage
ticket
for
naples
from
his
pocket
i
shall
not
need
these
nevertheless
prudence
bade
him
wait
until
he
had
seen
the
gold
before
destroying
the
paraphernalia
of
his
possible
flight
and
oh
the
joy
of
that
saturday
morning
when
gasmerilda
having
by
an
almost
effort
having
rid
herself
of
the
straw
as
her
fairy
godmother
had
bade
her
to
do
led
her
trembling
father
into
her
boudoir
and
showed
him
the
glittering
bar
are
you
sure
it
real
he
quavered
i
have
had
it
stamped
at
the
assay
office
father
she
replied
see
and
she
showed
him
the
stamps
of
the
authorized
government
test
my
child
he
cried
dancing
about
the
room
in
a
delirium
of
joy
my
beloved
my
beautiful
daughter
was
ever
miller
so
blessed
as
i
wait
rushing
madly
to
the
jeweled
he
rang
up
colonel
midas
excuse
me
for
bothering
you
colonel
he
said
excitedly
but
this
is
miller
i
thought
you
would
be
interested
to
know
that
my
daughter
has
turned
the
trick
a
little
sooner
than
i
expected
if
you
want
to
see
the
gold
instead
of
waiting
until
monday
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
say
so
the
wire
fairly
sizzled
with
the
reply
of
course
colonel
midas
would
not
wait
in
fact
he
be
right
up
how
much
did
the
miller
think
the
gold
would
pan
out
oh
about
a
thousand
dollars
replied
the
miller
what
roared
midas
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
gold
from
a
bub
bale
of
straw
that
the
assay
office
estimate
said
the
miller
with
a
smile
you
ca
very
well
go
behind
that
the
answer
was
a
long
low
whistle
and
within
twenty
minutes
the
great
financier
car
came
chugging
up
to
the
door
and
he
entered
the
house
bringing
with
him
a
chemist
illustration
this
is
the
greatest
cinch
in
the
history
of
finance
by
jingo
miller
he
cried
after
the
chemist
had
applied
every
known
test
to
the
bar
and
declared
it
to
be
beyond
all
question
the
real
stuff
by
jingo
old
man
our
fortune
is
made
this
is
the
greatest
cinch
in
the
history
of
finance
looks
that
way
said
the
miller
calmly
leaning
forward
and
tossing
the
steerage
ticket
into
the
we
er
we
must
keep
it
in
the
family
miller
the
colonel
added
slapping
the
proud
father
familiarly
on
the
knee
for
gasmerilda
had
remembered
the
fairy
godmother
injunction
as
to
the
use
of
her
eyes
i
intend
to
colonel
said
the
miller
dryly
i
keep
it
in
family
if
you
do
mind
midas
gasped
and
then
he
laughed
sheepishly
to
think
that
i
a
hardened
old
bachelor
should
be
a
victim
to
love
at
first
sight
he
said
very
funny
indeed
laughed
the
miller
what
would
you
say
to
me
as
a
eh
midas
went
on
you
know
i
a
decent
chap
old
man
no
funny
business
about
my
private
life
it
a
good
chance
to
get
your
daughter
settled
in
life
and
well
i
do
know
said
the
miller
coolly
you
are
generally
considered
to
be
a
fairly
eligible
sort
of
person
midas
but
my
daughter
can
afford
to
marry
for
love
as
long
as
the
straw
crop
holds
good
a
glitter
came
into
midas
eye
what
if
i
were
to
corner
the
market
he
demanded
that
would
be
bad
for
gasmerilda
and
me
the
miller
agreed
mind
you
i
have
said
i
disapproved
of
the
match
but
let
be
perfectly
frank
with
each
other
i
not
going
to
sell
my
daughter
to
you
or
to
anybody
else
but
you
know
how
things
run
these
days
a
man
a
millionaire
and
a
member
of
the
club
now
i
know
the
first
blessed
thing
about
your
prospects
you
are
rich
now
but
who
knows
that
before
you
wo
be
in
a
federal
jail
somewhere
without
a
nickel
i
see
your
point
said
midas
and
i
settle
five
million
on
her
real
money
he
demanded
real
money
said
midas
done
ejaculated
the
miller
and
so
the
papers
settling
five
million
dollars
in
approved
securities
upon
the
miller
daughter
were
executed
and
three
months
later
that
invincible
old
bachelor
john
midas
for
whom
countless
widows
had
set
their
caps
in
vain
was
led
to
the
altar
by
the
blushing
and
happy
gasmerilda
the
groom
gift
to
the
bride
was
a
princely
one
consisting
of
ten
million
dollars
worth
of
the
preferred
stock
of
the
newly
organized
american
straw
and
hay
trust
of
which
colonel
midas
was
president
a
concern
controlling
all
the
leading
straw
industries
of
the
united
states
and
some
said
of
foreign
lands
as
well
the
papers
called
it
the
most
brilliant
match
of
the
season
but
none
the
less
the
bride
had
some
misgivings
she
knew
and
somehow
or
other
in
the
perspective
of
the
vista
of
wedded
bliss
ahead
of
her
no
larger
than
a
she
seemed
at
times
to
see
the
first
faint
symptoms
of
a
cloud
which
might
sooner
or
later
obscure
the
whole
heavens
aye
even
that
vast
stretch
of
blue
that
reached
from
the
easternmost
part
of
new
york
to
the
westernmost
boundaries
of
reno
nevada
still
back
of
this
was
a
silver
nay
a
golden
lining
for
gasmerilda
was
now
the
possessor
in
her
own
right
of
five
million
dollars
in
real
money
and
with
such
a
possession
in
hand
one
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
domestic
misunderstanding
and
even
then
there
was
the
chance
that
the
sporting
instincts
of
colonel
midas
would
prove
to
be
such
that
he
would
admire
the
genius
back
of
the
transmutation
that
had
originally
won
him
in
addition
to
which
was
the
other
fact
that
already
without
a
bale
in
sight
he
had
sold
the
public
over
fifty
millions
worth
of
the
common
stock
in
the
united
states

and
hay

at
the

new
development
in

situation
already
sufficiently
distressing

the
janitor
ut

pretty
cold
snap
we
do

havin
jack
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
things
had
gone
ill
for
the
unhappy
lad
for
a
long
time
now
and
the
sudden
precipitation
of
winter
weather
found
him
practically
penniless
for
one
reason
or
another
no
one
seemed
to
care
for
his
poetry
and
his
last
story
from
the
proceeds
of
which
he
had
expected
to
make
enough
to
tide
him
over
for
a
little
while
at

been
returned
by
every
editor
in

ut
mighty
sorry

asked
the

with
a
grin
and
then
as
jack
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
a
dejected
reverie
he
gathered
up
his
tools
and
left
the
room
an
hour
passed
before
the
miserable
lad
even
so
much
as
raised
his
head
jove
it
cold
he
shivered
as
he
gazed
around
him
the
room
bathed
in
the
gathering
shadows
of
twilight
and
to
think
that
it
was
only
last
summer
that
i
was
complaining
because
this
place
was
so
infernally
hot
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
spoke
and
he
suddenly
bethought
himself
of
his
overcoat
hanging
in
the
closet
his
very
last
possession
and
one
he
had
worn
persistently
of
late
not
so
much
because
the
temperature
of
the
town
required
it
as
to
maintain
publicly
an
appearance
of
prosperity
i
take
one
last
wear
out
of
you
he
said
as
he
put
it
on
and
i
put
you
in
cold
storage
at
the
house
of
mine
uncle
he
already
has
my
watch
my
and
everything
else
that
i
have
that
is
negotiable
he
might
as
well
top
his
collection
off
with
you
the
thought
that
the
useful
old
garment
was
still
good
enough
to
act
as
a
satisfactory
bit
of
security
for
a
temporary
accommodation
at
the
neighboring
pawnshop
cheered
him
up
somewhat
and
he
went
out
seeking
a
comfortable
spot
where
with
his
last
he
could
assuage
the
growing
pangs
of
hunger
as
he
left
the
house
he
noticed
that
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
so
he
decided
not
to
go
very
far
afield
for
his
meal
a
cheap
restaurant
down
the
block
on
the
avenue
attracted
his
eye
and
he
went
in
and
ordered
his
dinner
cents
worth
of
roast
beef
and
a
cup
of
coffee
for
himself
and
the
balance
to
tip
the
waiter
he
ate
slowly
though
this
was
not
his
habit
merely
because
the
place
was
warm
and
bright
and
as
he
lingered
over
his
coffee
he
wrote
a
sonnet
on
life
on
the
back
of
the
bill
of
fare
then
his
account
paid
he
started
back
to
his
apartment
as
he
left
the
café
the
wheezing
notes
of
a
minute
playing
the
good
old
fell
upon
his
ear
it
sounded
very
much
like
a
in
the
last
stages
of
bronchitis
and
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
that
sounded
more
like
a
sneeze
than
a
note
a
heartrending
picture
of
misery
and
desolation
smote
upon
his
vision
on
the
corner
exposed
to
all
the
icy
winds
that
blew
up
the
avenue
and
over
the
from
the
river
huddled
up
into
a
seeming
mass
of
rags
over
which
the
falling
snow
was
drifting
was
the
form
of
an
aged
woman
turning
the
crank
of
a
battered
and
broken
organ
with
fitful
twists
of
her
poor
blue
hands
holy
smoke
cried
jack
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
old
woman
bent
figure
and
i
have
been
sympathizing
with
myself
for
the
last
four
hours
in
an
instant
he
had
whipped
off
his
overcoat
the
coat
that
had
been
his
only
hope
for
immediate
financial
relief
and
had
thrown
it
across
the
poor
old
shoulders
excuse
me
madam
he
said
as
the
old
woman
stopped
grinding
the
organ
to
look
gratefully
up
into
his
face
if
i
had
any
money
i
give
it
to
you
but
i
dead
broke
myself
and
i
ca
help
you
that
way
but
by
thunder
i
ca
stand
seeing
you
freeze
oh
i
can
not
take
your
coat
sir
the
old
woman
began
yes
you
can
said
jack
if
you
do
want
it
as
an
act
of
charity
let
me
have
a
quarter
to
buy
my
breakfast
morning
and
you
can
have
the
coat
for
the
time
being
i
rent
it
to
you
for
a
quarter
you
can
return
it
in
the
morning
i
live
right
across
the
street
at
the
redmere
the
old
woman
muttered
a
scarcely
audible
word
of
thanks
heaven
will
reward
you
for
this
she
began
that
all
right
said
jack
cheerfully
i
not
looking
for
dividends
of
that
particular
kind
i
consider
it
a
good
bargain
if
you
just
rent
this
old
for
the
night
for
cents
then
nobody
will
be
under
obligation
to
anybody
else
the
old
woman
smiled
even
as
she
shivered
and
diving
down
into
the
mysterious
depths
of
her
ragged
garments
produced
a
handful
of
pennies
which
she
handed
to
the
unexpected
philanthropist
i
will
return
the
coat
in
the
morning
she
said
and
again
the
withered
hand
began
to
turn
the
crank
and
the
suffering
organ
as
jack
sped
across
the
way
to
the
redmere
again
began
to
wheeze
as
before
taking
a
turn
this
time
at
that
popular
melody
there
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
poor
old
hag
muttered
jack
as
without
removing
his
clothes
he
climbed
into
bed
and
covered
himself
in
addition
with
the
i
may
be
different
kinds
of
an
ass
but
here
to
the
heart
of
folly
i
could
let
that
old
creature
freeze
to
death
under
my
very
window
and
warmed
by
the
thought
of
a
kindly
deed
done
he
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
so
weary
was
the
poor
lad
after
the
troublesome
experiences
of
a
day
so
full
of
worry
that
he
slept
heavily
and
far
into
the
next
morning
indeed
it
required
all
the
elbow
power
of
mike
the
janitor
hammering
with
his
great
fist
upon
the
door
to
awaken
him
hello
there
what
the
dickens
do
you
want
cried
jack
sleepily
aroused
at
last
from
his
slumbers
by
a
thunderous
kick
upon
the
door
from
the
janitorial
foot
ut
me
sorr
replied
mike
oh
it

is
it
said
jack
opening
the
door
what
the
trouble
now

from
the
landlord
to

sleeping

replied
the
janitor
sure
an
i
just
afther

yez
a
package
lift
at
the
door
confound
you
mike
growled
jack
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
nobody
can
economize
with
a
noise
trust
like
you
around
if
you
had
only
let
me
sleep
an
hour
longer
i
could
have
saved
the
price
of
a
breakfast
well
the
lady
that
lift
this
bundle
tould
me
to
give

without
anny
delay

mike
and
whin
annybody

a

you
a
dollar

demanded
jack
incredulously
she
did
that
said
mike
she
come
drivin
up
in
her
limybean
and
give
me
the
package
and
tould
me
not
to
let
anny
weeds
grow
under
me
slippers
jack
rubbed
his
eyes
in
astonishment
and
gazed
wonderingly
at
the
package
what
could
it
be
certainly
not
his
fur
coat
a
limousine
car
and
the
lady
of
the
wheezy
did
not
seem
to
go
together
in
an
instant
consumed
with
curiosity
he
tore
off
the
covering
and
found
within
a
white
pasteboard
box
oblong
in
shape
and
tied
up
with
blue
ribbon
attached
to
the
middle
was
a
note
which
on
being
opened
revealed
the
following
message
to
jack
staring
eyes
the
united
states
fairy
company
wall
street
new
york
dear
jack
i
return
your
cloak
herewith
with
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
to
yours
gratefully
titania
godmother
president
the
united
states
fairy
well
i
be
blowed
ejaculated
the
lad
as
he
read
the
old
lady
a
fairy
i
do
know
about
this
it
has
a
phony
look
to
me
as
he
spoke
he
cut
the
blue
ribbon
with
his
penknife
and
opened
the
box
the
mystery
instead
of
being
solved
now
became
all
the
deeper
for
as
far
as
jack
eye
was
able
to
see
the
box
was
empty
the
janitor
grinned
unsympathetically
quare
toime
for
an
joke
he
said
as
he
left
the
room
for
a
few
moments
jack
was
as
silent
as
the
sphinx
and
then
with
a
sudden
surge
of
wrath
that
any
one
should
play
such
a
trick
upon
him
he
gave
the
box
a
kick
that
sent
it
flying
across
the
room
it
landed
on
a
chair
the
cover
fell
off
and
then
mystery
of
mysteries
of
the
chair
disappeared
wholly
from
sight
again
jack
rubbed
his
eyes
in
amazement
and
slowly
like
a
trapper
passing
along
a
forest
trail
he
crept
over
to
where
the
chair
stood
and
put
out
his
hand
to
feel
for
its
missing
parts
in
a
moment
he
was
reassured
as
to
their
existence
for
he
could
feel
the
outlines
of
the
missing
sections
but
something
apparently
lay
across
them
it
was
a
soft
silky
material
tangible
enough
but
absolutely
invisible
it
felt
like
a
cloak
and
as
jack
passed
his
hands
along
its
folds
he
found
that
it
had
sleeves
buttons
buttonholes
and
a
hood
at
the
back
of
its
collar
not
to
mention
several
capacious
pockets
within
huh
he
ejaculated
it
feels
like
an
invisible
ulster
i
wonder
an
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
acting
upon
which
he
seized
the
cloak
and
rushed
into
his
bedroom
where
standing
before
the
mirror
on
his
bureau
he
put
it
on
buttoning
it
all
the
way
up
to
his
neck
this
done
he
glanced
at
himself
in
the
glass
his
head
which
had
remained
uncovered
was
reflected
there
well
of
all
he
began
astounded
at
the
vision
before
him
or
rather
the
lack
of
it
hastily
he
pulled
the
hood
over
his
head
and
immediately
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
he
completely
vanished
and
then
jack
knew
what
had
happened
the
fairy
godmother
had
given
him
one
of
the
choicest
possessions
of
her
kingdom
the
famous
invisible
cloak
ten
minutes
later
jack
found
himself
passing
through
the
subway
gate
at
street
entirely
unobserved
by
anybody
and
therefore
relieved
of
the
necessity
of
paying
his
fare
the
invisible
cloak
was
doing
its
duty
nobly
but
a
moment
later
the
lad
had
an
example
of
its
dangers
as
well
as
of
its
virtues
for
as
he
sat
quietly
by
the
door
of
the
car
trying
to
collect
his
flustered
thoughts
a
very
stout
german
gentleman
got
aboard
the
train
and
sat
down
heavily
upon
him
he
did
not
stay
however
but
on
the
contrary
with
a
startled
cry
of
alarm
rose
up
as
quickly
as
he
had
sat
down
illustration
dere
iss
somedings
in
dot

alretty
yet
dere
iss
somedings
in
dot
seadt
alretty
yet
he
cried
to
the
guard
excitedly
jack
slipped
noiselessly
out
of
the
seat
and
the
guard
after
feeling
around
in
it
for
a
second
or
two
turned
with
scorn
upon
the
astonished
teuton
and
in
language
of
a
slightly
unparliamentary
cast
advised
him
to
change
his
diet
you
be
seein
next
he
said
jack
shook
with
internal
laughter
as
the
amazed
son
of
the
rhine
sat
cautiously
down
again
his
face
showing
a
deal
of
relief
to
find
that
his
first
spooky
impression
was
not
correct
all
of
which
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
he
openly
expressed
with
considerable
volubility
finally
he
was
interrupted
by
the
raucous
voice
of
the
guard
crying
wall
street
now
jack
had
not
consciously
started
out
to
go
to
wall
street
but
the
announcement
of
the
train
arrival
there
gave
him
a
thrill
wall
street
eh
he
muttered
ha
hum
methinks
the
financial
stringency
is
over
if
this
little
old
coat
holds
out
i
seem
to
detect
the
odor
of
money
he
mounted
the
steps
to
the
street
and
wandered
aimlessly
down
the
great
financial
highway
until
he
found
himself
standing
before
the
gorgeous
façade
of
the
famous
urban
national
bank
here
he
paused
a
moment
and
curiosity
as
much
as
anything
else
led
him
to
enter
its
portals
and
there
within
lay
spread
before
his
famished
financial
eyes
separated
from
his
hands
only
by
a
slight
bit
of
steel
grillwork
countless
packages
huge
of
bulk
of
in
all
denominations
any
one
of
which
once
in
his
possession
would
serve
to
put
him
at
ease
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
monte
cristo
himself
had
no
such
stores
of
wealth
within
his
reach
in
the
of
his
wondrous
island
the
teller
behind
the
grill
was
counting
the
contents
of
his
safe
and
as
he
bent
over
to
foot
up
a
column
of
figures
jack
stopped
in
front
of
the
little
window
and
said
he
did
this
not
so
much
for
the
fun
of
it
as
for
a
precautionary
test
of
his
invisibility
for
a
great
scheme
had
entered
his
mind
the
teller
looked
up
craned
his
neck
in
every
direction
and
peered
around
to
see
who
had
addressed
him
illustration
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
my
nerves
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
my
nerves
this
morning
he
said
scratching
his
head
in
bewilderment
i
was
sure
somebody
spoke
to
me
jack
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
but
safety
bade
him
restrain
the
impulse
and
in
a
moment
he
had
climbed
over
the
steel
grillwork
and
entered
the
sacred
precincts
of
ready
money
once
within
the
teller
cage
his
heart
began
to
thump
so
violently
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
escape
detection
but
so
busy
were
all
the
bank
people
with
the
duties
of
the
day
that
no
one
seemed
to
hear
and
then
our
hero
began
within
five
minutes
he
had
stowed
away
within
the
capacious
pockets
of
his
invisible
cloak
as
many
of
the
packages
of
bills
and
yellow
as
he
could
possibly
carry
there
and
then
slipping
out
through
the
little
door
at
the
rear
of
the
cage
he
walked
calmly
out
of
the
bank
with
them
arrived
on
broadway
he
removed
his
coat
and
hanging
it
over
his
arm
took
a
taxicab
back
to
the
redmere
he
could
hardly
wait
until
he
reached
his
apartment
to
count
up
the
results
of
his
morning
work
but
his
caution
stood
by
him
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
locked
his
door
and
barricaded
it
with
the
bureau
rolled
in
front
of
it
that
he
opened
the
various
packages
there
were
ten
of
them
altogether
and
jack
eyes
nearly
popped
out
of
his
head
with
wonder
as
he
saw
so
much
real
money
spread
out
before
him
three
of
the
packages
held
one
thousand
dollars
each
in
bills
four
of
them
held
five
hundred
dollars
each
in
bills
and
the
other
three
totalled
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
ones
and
twos
hundred
dollars
altogether
mike
he
cried
going
to
the
dumbwaiter
shaft
and
calling
down
vociferously
turn
on
the
heat
and
tell
the
boss
to
send
a
truck
around
here
for
his
rent
hiding
the
money
under
the
mattress
of
his
bed
jack
removed
the
invisible
cloak
and
hung
it
in
the
closet
taking
care
to
lock
the
door
thereof
and
then
he
started
to
shave
his
hand
trembled
too
much
for
this
however
and
after
he
had
snipped
off
two
or
three
pieces
of
his
cheek
he
abandoned
the
effort
but
his
brief
trial
before
the
glass
had
a
distinct
moral
influence
upon
him
for
as
his
eye
caught
its
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
and
jack
came
to
look
himself
squarely
in
the
face
for
the
first
time
since
his
removal
of
the
money
from
the
bank
he
found
that
he
could
not
do
it
his
eye
faltered
and
fell
and
the
question
flashed
across
his
mind
as
to
the
honesty
of
his
work
hum
he
muttered
sitting
down
suddenly
on
his
bed
and
staring
at
a
hole
in
the
carpet
i
had
thought
of
that
before
what
would
my
poor
but
honest
parents
think
about
this
he
scratched
the
end
of
his
nose
thoughtfully
it
is
any
too
straight
even
in
these
days
of
frenzied
finance
he
went
on
that
is
it
is
unless
i
regard
this
thing
as
a
loan
of
course
if
it
a
loan
yes
it
must
be
otherwise
i
no
better
than
any
other
his
brow
cleared
as
the
idea
entered
his
mind
i
make
it
in
a
jiffy
he
said
he
went
to
his
and
wrote
to
the
cashier
of
the
urban
national
bank
as
follows

york

this
morning
negotiated

purchased
a
blank
promissory
note
at
a
stationery
store
on
the

and
filled
it
in

six
months
after

received
me
both
these
interesting
documents
he
now
inclosed
in
an
envelope
with
one
hundred
and
dollars
in
bills
sending
the
whole
by
mail
to
the
cashier
of
the
bank
there
said
jack
when
he
had
completed
this
righteous
act
i
can
now
look
myself
in
the
eye
again
from
this
time
on
jack
wore
his
invisible
cloak
nearly
all
the
time
he
found
it
very
convenient
especially
when
he
wished
to
go
to
the
theatre
or
to
ride
on
any
of
our
vehicles
of
public
transportation
once
he
seriously
contemplated
a
trip
to
europe
in
it
but
this
was
postponed
by
a
sudden
important
development
which
called
for
his
attention
nearer
home
while
seated
in
the
back
of
colonel
midas
box
at
the
metropolitan
opera
house
one
night
listening
to
the
dreamy
numbers
of
la
bohème
utterly
unobserved
of
course
by
any
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
box
thanks
to
his
magic
cloak
jack
overheard
colonel
midas
engaged
in
a
strenuous
conversation
with
one
of
his
male
relatives
who
had
asked
the
eminent
financier
for
some
kind
of
a
tip
that
would
make
a
rich
man
of
him
if
you
tell
me
whether
the
san
francisco
omaha
mott
haven
is
going
to
buy
the
or
not
colonel
the
man
had
said
i
can
make
a
million
or
two
of
course
you
could
jim
said
the
colonel
but
i
ca
tell
you
now
what
will
be
done
in
that
matter
i
do
know
myself
whether
we
buy
or
build
our
own
connecting
line
we
have
decided
if
we
do
buy
the
stock
will
go
jumping
up
ten
twenty
thirty
points
at
a
time
if
we
do
the
bottom
will
drop
out
of
it
it
the
turn
of
a
hand
which
way
that
cat
will
jump
but
i
do
this
for
you
as
soon
as
i
do
know
i
give
you
hours
start
with
the
inside
information
we
have
a
secret
meeting
at
my
office
to
discuss
the
matter
and
when
we
come
to
a
definite
understanding
i
give
you
the
tip
what
i
can
tell
you
now
is
that
the
new
line
into
buffalo
is
going
to
run
through
rocky
corners
and
anybody
who
gets
hold
of
old
hiram
bumpus
farm
up
there
under
a
hundred
thousand
will
clear
half
a
million
without
getting
out
of
bed
why
do
you
go
in
and
buy
it
yourself
demanded
the
other
because
i
not
wasting
my
gray
matter
on
piking
little
deals
that
why
retorted
midas
with
a
glance
of
scorn
at
his
guest
bursting
with
this
valuable
information
jack
immediately
left
the
opera
house
and
dispatched
a
rush
telegram
to
hiram
bumpus
at
rocky
corners
offering
him
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
his
farm
the
answer
came
back
the
next
morning
price
of
farm
thousand
cash
no
checks
taken
hiram
bumpus
to
which
jack
immediately
replied
price
satisfactory
will
arrive
thursday
with
money
this
done
our
hero
proceeded
to
camp
on
the
front
doorstep
of
colonel
midas
and
when
that
distinguished
financier
appeared
to
take
his
motor
down
to
his
office
jack
still
wearing
his
invisible
cloak
climbed
in
alongside
of
him
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe
lest
he
should
betray
his
presence
in
the
car
rode
down
to
the
offices
of
the
midas
trust
company
with
the
magnate
himself
here
midas
descended
from
the
car
and
jack
close
upon
his
heels
followed
him
into
that
holy
of
financial
holies
the
private
office
any
word
from
rockernegie
asked
the
colonel
of
his
secretary
as
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
jack
meanwhile
having
perched
himself
on
the
mantelpiece
here
at
ten
returned
the
secretary
laconically
they
did
not
even
waste
breath
in
that
office
moneypenny
wires
here
asterbilt
yachting
mediterranean
leaves
all
to
you
good
said
midas
when
they
come
show
them
in
and
i
out
to
everybody
else
and
then
it
was
that
jack
had
his
first
glimpse
of
really
great
men
in
action
by
all
the
magnates
of
finance
with
the
exception
of
asterbilt
were
on
hand
and
the
secret
meeting
of
the
rulers
of
the
san
francisco
omaha
mott
haven
transcontinental
railway
system
was
on
they
came
down
to
business
without
any
preliminaries
is
it
buy
or
build
asked
midas
buy
said
rockernegie
build
said
moneypenny
all
right
we
buy
said
midas
it
a
said
moneypenny
was
built
for
no
other
purpose
perfectly
true
said
midas
therefore
instead
of
announcing
that
we
shall
buy
thus
sending
the
price
up
till
it
bumps
against
the
dipper
let
us
announce
that
we
have
decided
to
build
our
own
connecting
line
and
when
lands
down
around
we
can
go
in
and
scoop
it
always
right
midas
said
rockernegie
i
change
my
vote
and
make
it
unanimous
said
moneypenny
whereupon
the
colonel
passed
the
cigars
and
the
meeting
stood
adjourned
it
had
taken
seven
minutes
to
settle
a
question
involving
millions
upon
millions
of
dollars
and
for
a
moment
jack
stood
aghast
but
for
no
longer
than
a
moment
for
the
time
for
him
to
get
busy
had
arrived
he
was
in
possession
of
the
most
valuable
secret
on
wall
street
and
it
behooved
him
to
begin
operations
passing
hastily
out
of
the
office
he
first
paid
a
visit
to
the
urban
national
where
after
an
hour
hard
work
he
succeeded
in
getting
out
of
the
vaults
leaving
on
the
cashier
desk
while
he
was
out
at
lunch
as
security
for
his
loan
a
sufficient
amount
of
collateral
also
taken
from
the
vaults
of
the
bank
itself
it
all
right
jack
wrote
in
his
memorandum
to
the
cashier
i
have
a
big
transaction
on
hand
which
ca
help
win
out
and
i
shall
rejoice
your
heart
by
liquidating
all
my
loans
with
you
before
spring
after
all
my
dear
sir
all
business
must
be
done
on
confidence
and
i
assure
you
you
can
have
plenty
in
me
i
know
myself
through
and
through
and
can
testify
to
my
absolute
integrity
meanwhile
let
me
repeat
that
your
money
is
the
best
i
have
ever
used
and
is
received
everywhere
with
real
enthusiasm
that
night
before
he
retired
operating
through
a
dozen
brokers
offices
so
as
not
to
attract
undue
attention
jack
purchased
five
thousand
shares
of
at
paying
for
them
in
cash
the
next
morning
on
the
announcement
from
colonel
midas
office
that
the
san
francisco
omaha
mott
haven
road
had
decided
not
to
take
over
the
property
fell
off
to
at
which
figure
after
a
hurried
visit
to
the
bank
jack
acquired
ten
thousand
more
shares
at
the
end
of
the
week
had
slumped
to
whereat
jack
pyramided
by
taking
over
twenty
thousand
more
all
paid
for
in
cash
having
meanwhile
sent
his
lawyer
to
rocky
corners
with
thousand
dollars
to
close
his
deal
with
hiram
bumpus
in
the
brief
period
of
ten
days
the
unfortunate
tenant
of
the
freezing
apartment
at
the
redmere
had
become
the
owner
of
fifty
thousand
shares
of
as
well
as
the
proprietor
of
a
farm
through
which
a
new
line
of
railway
was
sure
to
pass
so
the
campaign
went
on
over
the
christmas
season
jack
by
following
close
on
the
heels
of
midas
or
moneypenny
it
mattered
little
which
secured
inside
information
as
to
every
deal
of
magnitude
on
wall
street
whole
days
and
even
weeks
before
anybody
else
knew
about
it
and
having
the
resources
of
the
urban
national
to
draw
upon
at
need
he
was
never
at
a
loss
how
to
finance
himself
january
came
and
just
as
it
seemed
as
if
was
about
to
be
wiped
out
of
existence
came
the
report
that
the
property
had
been
acquired
by
the
san
francisco
omaha
mott
haven
crowd
and
that
its
stock
had
been
put
on
an
basis
the
quotation
immediately
began
to
soar
began
to
jump
like
a
kangaroo
first
it
leaped
to
then
to
on
the
tenth
of
january
it
opened
at
and
closed
at
where
it
stuck
for
a
time
jack
waited
for
a
further
rise
but
it
failed
to
come
and
in
february
he
sold
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
shares
which
had
cost
him
on
an
average
of
a
share
for
a
share
realizing
a
profit
of
reference
to
his
books
showed
that
he
had
drawn
on
the
urban
national
for
a
trifle
over
which
sum
he
now
started
to
return
in
the
same
laborious
fashion
in
which
it
had
been
acquired
every
day
for
a
period
of
ten
days
the
lad
would
put
on
his
invisible
cloak
and
at
the
cashier
would
walk
into
his
office
and
deposit
a
great
bundle
of
currency
on
his
desk
once
he
found
that
gentleman
and
the
president
of
the
bank
as
well
awaiting
him
but
it
made
no
difference
secure
in
the
concealment
of
his
marvellous
cloak
jack
stood
in
the
doorway
and
tossed
the
package
of
bills
into
the
room
hitting
the
astonished
president
of
the
bank
himself
squarely
in
the
stomach
with
it
in
this
way
complete
restitution
with
interest
was
made
and
on
the
first
of
february
jack
found
himself
clear
of
all
obligations
with
a
comfortable
fortune
of
over
on
his
hands
which
made
any
further
involuntary
loans
on
the
bank
part
unnecessary
but
what
was
even
better
than
this
the
meteoric
successes
of
the
young
millionaire
upon
the
street
brought
him
such
renown
that
it
was
not
long
before
the
powers
began
to
take
notice
that
young
man
said
colonel
midas
after
watching
him
for
a
little
while
is
the
most
singularly
astute
person
i
ever
met
i
do
wish
to
be
vulgar
but
he
has
been
the
nigger
in
every
woodpile
i
have
tackled
for
six
months
he
knows
what
i
am
going
to
do
almost
as
quick
as
i
do
we
have
to
take
him
in
the
firm
he
has
a
singularly
keen
premonition
as
to
values
observed
rockernegie
i
half
a
mind
to
start
a
trust
company
and
make
him
president
as
for
moneypenny
after
a
year
experience
at
finding
jack
at
the
bottom
of
pretty
nearly
every
scheme
he
went
into
he
made
the
following
observation
to
his
daughter
as
he
pointed
jack
out
to
her
at
the
opera
in
his
own
box
now
one
night
that
young
man
in
the
third
box
on
the
left
my
dear
is
young
jack
hardluck
he
so
keen
that
i
do
even
dare
think
what
i
going
to
do
for
fear
he
find
it
out
if
that
the
case
papa
said
miss
moneypenny
blushing
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
take
him
into
the
family
do
you
think
better
the
girl
hung
her
head
shyly
better
what
my
dear
asked
the
old
billionaire
kindly
give
him
to
me
for
a
christmas
present
she
answered
i
think
i
could
get
to
like
him
very
very
much
and
indeed
that
is
how
it
came
to
be
that
in
due
course
of
time
the
young
financier
became
the
of
one
of
the
financial
powers
of
the
world
as
for
the
invisible
cloak
jack
wears
it
now
only
to
travel
which
for
a
is
sometimes
convenient
incidentally
and
in
conclusion
let
me
add
that
mike
brannigan
once
the
janitor
of
the
redmere
is
now
the
owner
of
that
handsome
having
received
the
through
the
mails
from
some
anonymous
benefactor
who
the
divvle
sint
it
i
dinnaw
he
said
nor
what
for
he
done
it
nayther
i
ai
never
done
nothin
to
injure
nobody
vi
the
return
of
aladdin
night
had
fallen
over
the
city
but
the
work
in
the
little
tailor
shop
on
the
bowery
still
went
on
the
toiling
widow
of
mustafa
the
incorporated
valet
of
the
bachelors
aid
society
who
had
died
the
winter
before
leaving
his
family
with
nothing
but
a
few
debts
and
his
was
wearily
struggling
with
the
last
batch
of
undarned
socks
received
that
morning
from
the
association
she
sighed
deeply
as
she
labored
for
her
fingers
were
sore
with
many
stitches
heigho
she
murmured
sadly
why
do
these
bachelors
get
married
and
have
this
sort
of
thing
done
at
home
i
wonder
this
is
the
sock
i
have
darned
since
christmas
and
as
for
the
suspender
buttons
the
good
lord
only
knows
how
many
of
those
i
have
sewed
on
there
ought
to
be
a
law
compelling
men
to
marry
on
penalty
of
having
to
do
their
own
mending
poor
woman
in
the
weariness
of
her
spirit
she
little
dreamed
that
she
was
growing
petulant
with
her
bread
and
butter
suddenly
she
heard
the
door
of
the
little
shop
without
open
and
her
son
aladdin
entered
a
great
buoyant
lad
of
twenty
cheerful
of
spirit
and
a
good
deal
of
a
giant
physically
well
worthless
she
said
with
an
affectionate
glance
into
his
fine
eyes
where
have
you
been
all
day
looking
for
work
mother
as
usual
said
the
young
man
throwing
a
small
package
on
the
table
and
you
the
same
old
drudgery
dear
she
replied
with
a
sigh
did
you
have
any
luck
no
mother
dear
not
a
bit
replied
aladdin
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
in
all
this
great
city
there
is
no
work
of
any
kind
that
a
hale
hearty
hungry
boy
like
you
can
get
to
do
she
demanded
plenty
of
it
mother
replied
the
boy
plenty
of
it
but
nothing
in
my
special
line
lots
of
jobs
and
a
position
as
guard
on
the
subway
were
offered
me
but
i
can
not
demean
myself
by
taking
anything
of
that
sort
mummsy
dear
father
in
the
last
days
of
his
life
spent
too
many
hours
teaching
me
how
to
raise
mushrooms
under
glass
for
me
to
dishonor
his
memory
by
undertaking
labor
that
is
beneath
that
in
artistic
quality
and
just
at
present
i
can
not
find
anybody
in
all
this
city
who
wants
a
helper
in
mushroom
culture
then
we
shall
have
to
go
supperless
to
bed
sighed
the
poor
woman
not
a
penny
in
the
house
and
the
pantry
bare
oh
aladdin
aladdin
why
will
you
not
give
up
this
false
pride
of
yours
and
get
some
kind
of
a
job
that
will
at
least
feed
yourself
and
help
me
pay
the
rent
the
boy
was
silent
he
had
had
this
same
argument
with
his
mother
time
and
time
and
again
and
he
was
quite
aware
of
the
futility
of
speech
in
trying
to
overcome
her
objections
to
what
she
termed
his
incorrigible
idleness
what
have
you
in
the
package
the
woman
asked
after
a
prolonged
silence
i
do
know
replied
aladdin
i
picked
it
up
outside
the
of
the
helicon
theatre
i
saw
it
lying
in
the
snow
and
i
brought
it
along
with
me
it
is
probably
some
kind
of
a
box
belonging
to
one
of
the
performers
if
there
is
any
reward
offered
in
any
of
the
morning
papers
for
its
return
maybe
i
shall
earn
a
few
honest
pennies
by
taking
it
back
to
its
owner
his
mother
busied
herself
with
the
string
and
in
a
moment
it
came
untied
and
a
small
brass
lamp
rolled
out
of
the
covering
it
was
very
dirty

humph
said
she
scornfully
gazing
at
the
homely
little
object
i
do
think
anybody
will
be
foolish
enough
to
offer
a
reward
for
a
trumpery
little
thing
like
that
ah
well
said
aladdin
gazing
out
of
the
shop
window
at
the
scurrying
crowds
on
the
sidewalk
it
might
be
worse
mummsy
dear
we
at
least
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
this
night
which
is
more
than
some
of
those
poor
wretches
have
and
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
this
storm
that
is
upon
us
is
going
to
be
a
blizzard
in
very
truth
a
blizzard
had
descended
upon
the
city
all
the
transportation
lines
were
blocked
and
over
on
broadway
all
traffic
had
been
tied
up
for
hours
thanks
to
the
structure
this
portion
of
the
bowery
still
remained
passable
even
this
was
momentarily
piling
higher
and
higher
with
the
snow
and
the
wind
was
in
one
of
its
most
violently
rampageous
moods
how
would
you
feel
if
your
little
aladdin
had
a
job
as
a
chauffeur
on
a
night
like
this
the
lad
went
on
the
poor
woman
shuddered
and
was
about
to
reply
when
a
terrific
crash
from
without
drove
all
thought
of
words
from
her
mind
hastily
running
to
the
window
she
too
peered
out
into
the
street
for
a
moment
over
aladdin
shoulder
but
only
for
a
moment
for
in
an
instant
the
boy
was
up
and
making
for
the
door
of
the
little
tailor
shop
a
heavy
limousine
car
lay
overturned
upon
its
side
upon
the
walk
its
wheels
having
skidded
on
the
slippery
pavement
and
striking
the
curb
toppled
completely
over
aladdin
with
the
agility
of
a
small
monkey
soon
mounted
to
the
upper
side
of
the
overturned
vehicle
and
opening
the
door
had
assisted
a
beautifully
arrayed
young
woman
possibly
a
year
or
two
younger
than
himself
from
within
and
after
her
fuming
and
condemning
his
luck
and
the
world
in
general
a
and
apparently
irascible
old
gentleman
mother
cried
aladdin
as
the
girl
fainted
in
his
arms
come
quickly
the
young
lady
has
fainted
the
good
woman
needed
no
second
bidding
she
hastened
to
his
side
and
the
limp
form
of
the
young
girl
was
carried
in
her
strong
motherly
arms
into
the
little
back
room
behind
the
tailor
shop
which
formed
their
only
home
shortly
afterward
the
old
gentleman
came
also
ushered
in
by
aladdin
she
is
safe
cried
he
with
an
anxious
glance
at
the
prostrate
form
of
his
daughter
perfectly
so
sir
replied
aladdin
mother
she
has
only
fainted
wo
you
sit
down
sir
she
added
you
look
a
little
shaken
up
yourself
thank
you
said
the
old
gentleman
gazing
around
the
room
vainly
in
search
of
a
chair
ah
what
shall
i
sit
down
on
madam
try
the
stove
sir
laughed
aladdin
it
may
warm
it
up
a
bit
the
old
man
gazed
frowningly
at
the
boy
not
relishing
such
levity
at
so
serious
a
moment
and
aladdin
slightly
embarrassed
by
his
own
frivolity
tried
to
cover
his
confusion
by
seizing
the
lamp
that
had
fallen
from
the
package
and
polishing
its
highly
oxidized
surface
by
rubbing
it
on
the
patched
knee
of
his
trousers
and
then
a
strange
thing
came
to
pass
at
the
moment
of
the
first
attrition
between
his
knee
and
the
little
brass
lamp
the
room
seemed
to
fill
with
a
gray
mist
and
in
its
gathering
depths
aladdin
perceived
the
huge
figure
of
a
blackamoor
gradually
taking
shape
what
the
dickens
muttered
the
lad
to
himself
as
the
strange
apparition
rose
up
before
him
rubbing
his
eyes
to
make
sure
that
he
saw
clearly
what
do
you
want
he
added
springing
to
his
feet
as
the
genie
approached
him
i
have
come
in
response
to
your
summons
replied
the
blackamoor
give
your
orders
sir
aladdin
grinned
broadly
at
this
the
idea
of
his
ever
giving
orders
to
anybody
seemed
so
very
absurd
nevertheless
he
fell
in
with
the
spirit
of
the
hour
all
right
sambo
he
returned
get
this
gentleman
a
chair
there
may
be
an
extra
one
in
the
the
blackamoor
disappeared
for
an
instant
and
shortly
returned
bringing
with
him
the
desired
piece
of
furniture
thank
you
said
the
old
gentleman
as
he
took
his
seat
with
an
uneasy
glance
around
him
the
situation
was
not
altogether
without
alarming
features
as
for
aladdin
you
could
have
knocked
him
over
with
a
fan
so
astonished
was
he
at
this
unusual
development
i
wish
i
asked
for
something
to
eat
he
muttered
to
himself
so
do
i
observed
the
old
gentleman
i
give
five
hundred
dollars
just
now
for
a
boiled
egg
you
ought
to
get
one
studded
with
diamonds
at
that
price
laughed
aladdin
and
then
just
for
a
joke
he
turned
to
the
blackamoor
get
this
gentleman
five
hundred
dollars
worth
of
boiled
eggs
sambo
he
said
hard
or
soft
sir
asked
the
genie
three
minutes
said
the
old
gentleman
sambo
made
a
low
salaam
to
aladdin
and
departing
he
returned
four
minutes
later
followed
by
seven
other
blackamoors
just
like
him
each
carrying
a
large
wicker
hamper
on
his
shoulders
these
they
deposited
in
various
parts
of
the
room
and
gravely
opening
them
disclosed
to
the
astounded
gaze
of
aladdin
and
his
unknown
guest
hundreds
of
eggs
steaming
as
though
freshly
taken
from
the
pot
illustration
this
is
a
sir
said
sambo
this
is
a
sir
said
sambo
addressing
aladdin
we
will
return
with
the
remainder
in
a
minute
sir
just
wait
a
second
said
aladdin
scratching
his
head
in
bewilderment
at
the
sight
of
so
many
eggs
obtained
with
such
ease
it
may
be
that
these
will
be
enough
for
the
time
being
i
ask
the
old
chap
excuse
me
er
er
i
did
catch
your
name
sir
i
am
major
bondifeller
president
of
the
united
mints
of
north
america
replied
the
old
gentleman
a
person
not
to
be
trifled
with
young
man
as
you
probably
know
very
well
aladdin
gasped
as
well
he
might
here
was
old
rufus
bondifeller
reputed
to
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
a
guest
in
his
little
remnant
of
a
tailor
shop
to
you
sir
stammered
aladdin
do
you
think
there
enough
eggs
here
to
satisfy
your
hunger
there
appears
to
be
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
worth
here
now
but
if
you
wish
the
rest
served
immediately
great
heavens
no
roared
bondifeller
when
i
said
i
give
five
hundred
dollars
for
a
boiled
egg
i
was
merely
speaking
figuratively
a
rich
man
ca
eat
any
more
boiled
eggs
at
a
sitting
than
a
poor
man
fact
is
half
the
time
he
ca
eat
as
many
without
a
bad
attack
of
angina
pectoris
all
right
said
aladdin
resolved
to
carry
off
the
extraordinary
situation
with
an
outward
nonchalance
in
spite
of
the
inner
turmoil
that
kept
his
brain
whirling
you
need
bother
about
the
rest
of
those
eggs
now
sambo
major
bondifeller
can
get
along
on
these
the
blackamoor
and
his
companions
disappeared
even
as
they
had
come
apparently
irrespective
of
doorways
and
utterly
regardless
of
walls
they
seemed
merely
to
melt
through
whatever
solid
substances
there
might
be
between
themselves
and
annihilation
as
for
major
bondifeller
as
he
observed
these
strange
developments
his
face
grew
set
and
rigid
he
eyed
every
movement
of
the
blackamoors
with
uneasy
attention
until
they
had
vanished
from
sight
and
then
his
flashing
eye
was
riveted
upon
aladdin
finally
he
spoke
sharply
and
to
the
point
well
he
snapped
how
much
aladdin
started
the
icy
tone
of
the
speaker
voice
chilled
him
and
it
was
so
peremptory
that
he
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
he
had
been
stung
by
the
lash
how
much
what
he
said
finally
summoning
up
all
his
courage
to
face
the
apparently
angry
millionaire
do
try
to
evade
the
point
retorted
the
major
coldly
let
get
through
with
the
business
as
quickly
as
we
can
it
is
plain
as
a
pikestaff
to
anybody
having
half
an
eye
that
taking
advantage
of
our
mishap
you
have
lured
my
daughter
and
myself
in
here
for
your
own
profit
no
man
keeps
such
a
gang
of
niggers
on
hand
with
an
honest
purpose
so
what
are
your
demands
aladdin
laughed
in
spite
of
his
disturbed
frame
of
mind
at
the
suspicions
it
was
such
an
absurd
idea
that
he
could
be
at
the
head
of
a
and
yet
after
all
he
could
not
deny
a
certain
sort
of
reasonableness
in
the
notion
from
major
bondifeller
point
of
view
again
taking
the
lamp
casually
in
his
hand
more
as
an
outlet
for
his
embarrassment
than
for
any
other
reason
he
gave
it
a
second
rub
and
started
to
answer
the
major
question
but
as
before
the
mist
again
appeared
and
from
its
musty
depths
the
blackamoor
took
shape
and
salaamed
before
him
well
what
is
it
now
sambo
demanded
aladdin
frowning
at
the
intruder
illustration
you
rubbed
the
lamp
i
believe
your
orders
sir
said
the
blackamoor
you
rubbed
the
lamp
i
believe
aladdin
heart
leaped
into
his
mouth
had
rubbed
the
lamp
twice
and
twice
had
it
brought
him
aid
surely
there
must
be
some
magic
about
this
what
if
i
did
rub
the
lamp
he
queried
in
a
tremulous
voice
that
got
to
do
with
you
i
and
my
comrades
are
slaves
of
the
lamp
as
your
highness
very
well
knows
replied
the
blackamoor
whatever
your
commands
the
united
order
of
amalgamated
genii
must
obey
cried
aladdin
dancing
a
wild
fandango
about
the
room
wants
the
handsome
waiter
as
the
full
import
of
his
treasure
dawned
upon
his
mind
the
lad
ecstasy
bade
fair
to
surpass
all
bounds
but
the
chilling
voice
of
bondifeller
served
to
calm
his
effervescing
spirit
i
want
nothing
but
your
proposition
so
that
i
may
get
out
of
this
den
as
speedily
as
possible
he
was
saying
i
am
not
a
man
to
beat
about
the
bush
and
i
realize
that
you
have
got
me
what
is
it
you
demand
first
and
foremost
civility
said
aladdin
boldly
a
sense
of
his
own
power
sweeping
over
him
and
giving
him
confidence
i
guess
you
find
that
harder
to
negotiate
than
a
check
for
a
considerable
sum
major
bondifeller
cash
being
a
commoner
commodity
with
you
than
civility
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir
the
lad
went
on
i
had
your
daughter
carried
in
here
out
of
that
raging
blizzard
so
that
my
mother
could
give
her
the
attention
she
needed
you
i
brought
in
also
with
no
more
knowledge
of
who
you
were
and
with
no
more
idea
of
financially
profiting
by
your
accident
than
if
you
had
been
one
of
those
unfortunate
tramps
out
on
the
bowery
there
but
now
that
you
have
put
the
idea
in
my
mind
that
perhaps
after
all
nobody
ever
does
anything
unselfishly
in
this
world
i
will
make
certain
demands
of
you
to
begin
with
you
may
pay
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
those
eggs
and
as
a
mere
act
of
ordinary
generosity
you
may
tip
the
handsome
waiter
fifty
dollars
i
understand
too
sir
that
you
are
the
proprietor
of
these
ten
city
blocks
in
which
i
and
about
twenty
thousand
of
my
neighbors
are
housed
i
believe
i
do
own
considerable
property
hereabouts
said
the
millionaire
sullenly
though
i
ca
say
offhand
whether
i
do
or
not
my
agents
look
after
my
smaller
investments
well
said
aladdin
it
do
make
any
difference
to
me
whether
you
remember
what
you
own
or
not
the
results
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
will
be
the
same
you
will
have
these
ten
blocks
of
houses
torn
down
and
replaced
by
model
tenements
turning
the
alternate
blocks
into
city
parks
for
the
children
to
play
in
but
suppose
i
do
own
protested
bondifeller
what
you
do
own
major
bondifeller
returned
aladdin
is
too
trifling
a
detail
for
us
to
worry
over
so
long
as
you
do
own
me
i
do
care
a
pickled
herring
what
you
do
own
if
it
turns
out
upon
investigation
that
any
of
these
on
these
ten
city
squares
belong
to
anybody
else
buy
buy
snarled
bondifeller
how
can
i
buy
if
the
other
man
wo
sell
with
money
said
aladdin
the
same
stuff
you
always
use
to
buy
anything
else
you
happen
to
want
from
an
or
a
japanese
porcelain
up
to
a
state
legislature
or
a
man
conscience
and
if
i
do
agree
demanded
the
old
man
a
truculent
glare
in
his
eye
an
eye
before
which
the
powerful
men
of
the
earth
had
trembled
more
than
once
in
the
past
aladdin
returned
the
gaze
unflinchingly
once
more
he
rubbed
the
lamp
and
the
genie
appeared
as
before
sambo
said
the
lad
calmly
with
a
wink
at
the
slave
is
dungeon
number
on
the
fifteenth
tier
below
the
subway
occupied
no
sir
replied
the
blackamoor
with
a
grin
very
well
then
said
aladdin
coldly
you
may
provide
a
special
escort
of
fifteen
of
your
best
and
most
reliable
genii
and
have
them
take
this
young
lady
to
her
home
at
zoocrest
central
park
east
taking
care
that
nothing
shall
occur
either
to
frighten
her
or
to
make
her
uncomfortable
in
any
way
meanwhile
you
yourself
with
five
of
our
biggest
huskies
will
file
this
gentleman
here
away
for
the
night
in
dungeon
number
as
aforesaid
as
your
highness
directs
replied
the
obedient
blackamoor
in
a
moment
the
still
prostrate
form
of
miss
bondifeller
was
borne
gently
from
the
room
and
placed
in
a
large
that
suddenly
materialized
without
and
shortly
bondifeller
sitting
ruefully
alone
in
the
little
back
room
could
hear
it
chugging
up
the
snowbound
street
at
as
lively
a
pace
as
any
racer
ever
struck
upon
the
smoothest
of
boulevards
it
was
indeed
an
illuminating
exhibition
of
the
remarkable
resources
of
this
extraordinary
young
man
and
strange
to
say
a
contemplation
of
it
gave
the
old
gentleman
a
curious
sense
of
pleasure
to
be
sure
he
appeared
to
be
in
rather
a
bad
predicament
but
all
the
same
it
was
a
novel
sensation
to
him
to
encounter
somebody
who
apparently
did
not
fear
him
this
was
an
emotion
that
he
had
not
enjoyed
for
many
years
and
it
was
not
without
its
titillation
i
guess
you
got
me
young
man
he
said
rather
meekly
when
aladdin
returned
i
guess
that
a
good
guess
retorted
aladdin
nonchalantly
only
one
answer
to
the
question
that
confronts
you
and
you
lit
on
it
the
very
first
time
i
do
intend
to
be
at
all
vindictive
major
bondifeller
he
continued
but
a
little
lesson
in
arbitrary
power
is
going
to
do
you
a
bit
of
harm
so
just
make
up
your
mind
to
take
your
medicine
and
let
save
our
breath
to
talk
of
more
important
things
first
thing
i
hungry
mother
please
lay
covers
for
three
but
my
son
began
the
poor
woman
who
in
caring
for
the
unconscious
girl
had
seen
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
we
have
a
morsel
of
food
in
the
do
as
i
say
mother
said
aladdin
quickly
sambo
will
attend
to
the
rest
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
poor
laddy
murmured
his
mother
hastening
nevertheless
to
fulfil
his
commands
merely
as
a
means
of
keeping
him
quiet
meanwhile
aladdin
seizing
the
faithful
lamp
gave
it
another
rub
and
when
the
blackamoor
appeared
he
ordered
a
royal
repast
so
royal
indeed
that
old
major
bondifeller
eyes
nearly
popped
out
of
his
head
as
he
ran
over
the
order
a
few
suppers
of
that
sort
would
have
bankrupted
even
so
flourishing
a
concern
as
the
united
mints
of
north
america
any
favorite
dish
you
like
to
add
major
asked
aladdin
genially
the
old
man
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
this
exhibition
of
kindness
even
at
this
moment
when
they
were
practically
enemies
at
points
he
could
not
remember
in
his
own
line
of
effort
in
many
years
that
he
had
himself
ever
extended
any
consideration
to
a
fallen
foe
why
i
do
know
said
he
his
voice
growing
husky
with
emotion
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
all
the
luxury
i
am
enjoying
my
mind
runs
back
to
those
early
days
on
the
old
farm
when
my
mother
apple
pies
seemed
to
be
the
perfection
of
culinary
art
say
no
more
major
you
shall
have
your
wish
laughed
aladdin
then
turning
to
the
waiting
attendant
he
added
sambo
you
may
add
to
that
order
one
full
portion
of
pallid
pippin
pie
for
pale
people
with
a
glass
of
buttermilk
on
the
side
an
hour
later
the
happy
little
party
for
major
bondifeller
had
warmed
up
considerably
under
the
exhilarating
influence
of
his
strange
surroundings
broke
up
with
a
sense
of
repletion
that
neither
aladdin
nor
his
poor
mother
had
enjoyed
for
many
years
indeed
it
is
doubtful
if
the
young
man
himself
had
ever
had
so
square
a
meal
as
that
in
all
his
life
before
over
the
cigars
bondifeller
tried
to
take
up
the
thread
of
their
discourse
as
for
that
business
suggestion
of
yours
he
began
flicking
the
ash
airily
from
the
end
of
his
cigar
but
aladdin
stopped
him
i
make
it
a
rule
never
to
talk
business
at
or
immediately
after
dinner
major
he
said
reprovingly
the
hour
is
late
and
dungeon
number
awaits
you
i
trust
you
will
sleep
well
sambo
show
this
gentleman
to
his
room
but
began
bondifeller
on
your
way
sambo
said
aladdin
and
remember
that
if
this
gentleman
turns
up
missing
in
the
morning
you
lose
your
union
card
when
aladdin
awoke
the
following
morning
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
regard
the
events
of
the
night
before
as
nothing
more
than
a
fantastic
dream
and
he
was
chuckling
softly
to
himself
over
its
manifest
absurdities
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
spied
the
lamp
on
the
table
of
his
humble
little
room
he
eyed
it
keenly
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
springing
from
the
bed
he
seized
it
in
his
left
hand
and
began
rubbing
it
feverishly
with
his
right
as
had
invariably
happened
before
the
genie
responded
on
the
instant
your
orders
your
highness
he
said
aladdin
scratched
his
head
in
sheer
bewilderment
but
pulling
himself
together
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
he
answered
somewhat
haughtily
send
a
maid
to
my
mother
room
immediately
with
instructions
to
replenish
her
wardrobe
at
once
with
whatever
things
she
may
choose
to
ask
for
and
you
may
yourself
bring
me
my
new
frock
coat
with
the
lavender
trousers
and
the
white
piqué
vest
you
may
lay
out
my
best
shirt
and
my
mauve
tie
and
see
that
my
silk
socks
match
the
latter
i
shall
wear
my
shoes
this
morning
and
if
my
silk
hat
shows
any
signs
of
wear
get
me
a
new
one
yes
your
highness
said
the
blackamoor
and
will
your
grace
breakfast
yes
said
aladdin
have
breakfast
on
the
table
in
one
hour
from
now
fried
eggs
buckwheat
cakes
tenderloin
steak
and
a
little
salt
fish
i
desire
also
to
have
major
bondifeller
at
breakfast
with
me
and
mind
you
tell
him
not
to
keep
me
waiting
as
your
highness
wills
said
the
blackamoor
retiring
aladdin
orders
were
fulfilled
to
the
letter
and
after
the
breakfast
was
over
he
summoned
the
genie
with
a
considerable
flourish
which
deeply
impressed
his
guest
now
sambo
said
he
i
want
you
to
take
the
limousine
go
up
to
the
gotham
hotel
and
inform
the
proprietor
that
monsieur
le
duc
di
lumière
will
arrive
there
with
his
mother
the
countess
de
bougie
and
suite
precisely
at
noon
and
desires
the
best
accommodations
the
house
can
provide
to
inspire
confidence
you
would
better
take
a
few
diamond
necklaces
with
you
and
deposit
them
for
at
the
office
and
while
you
are
about
it
i
like
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
for
as
he
gave
these
orders
aladdin
scarcely
dared
look
at
the
genie
for
fear
of
rebellion
but
they
seemed
to
make
no
impression
at
all
upon
the
blackamoor
who
merely
bowed
his
acquiescence
and
handed
aladdin
a
bag
full
of
gold
pieces
as
for
the
major
who
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
he
merely
blinked
amazedly
at
these
astounding
occurrences
finally
he
found
his
voice
you
are
the
duc
di
lumière
he
asked
at
your
service
said
aladdin
and
may
i
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
in
these
squalid
quarters
continued
the
old
man
i
am
conducting
a
personal
investigation
into
the
lives
of
the
unfortunate
replied
aladdin
by
some
extraordinary
good
chance
the
fates
have
thrown
you
who
are
largely
responsible
for
the
awful
conditions
i
find
here
into
my
hands
with
power
to
control
your
movements
within
a
radius
of
ten
city
blocks
major
bondifeller
there
are
enough
human
souls
living
in
squalid
misery
to
populate
a
new
england
city
and
yet
you
pay
no
more
attention
to
them
nay
not
as
much
as
you
pay
to
a
fly
that
enters
your
house
and
buzzes
around
your
pate
you
give
the
fly
some
personal
attention
but
in
this
matter
of
your
tenements
you
do
nothing
whatsoever
leaving
it
to
an
agent
to
care
for
your
smaller
interests
i
believe
those
are
your
own
words
now
sir
it
is
in
my
power
to
keep
you
here
for
as
long
a
time
as
i
wish
but
i
do
want
to
make
a
prisoner
of
you
i
want
to
give
you
a
chance
to
do
something
for
your
especially
those
who
can
never
hope
to
repay
you
save
in
gratitude
you
heard
my
views
last
night
i
ask
nothing
for
myself
for
as
you
see
i
do
not
need
anything
for
myself
i
have
but
to
order
what
i
wish
and
it
is
here
your
model
tenements
are
a
useless
ideal
retorted
bondifeller
only
last
year
at
enormous
expense
i
put
in
all
my
tenements
and
my
agent
reports
that
the
tenants
use
them
to
store
their
coal
in
and
do
you
know
why
demanded
aladdin
ignorance
i
presume
said
bondifeller
allied
to
a
love
of
squalor
nothing
of
the
sort
retorted
aladdin
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
it
is
because
you
spent
all
your
appropriation
on
and
never
even
thought
of
putting
one
penny
into
the
construction
of
bondifeller
was
silent
he
had
never
thought
of
that
before
well
he
said
ruefully
i
suppose
i
must
agree
but
it
will
cost
twenty
millions
of
dollars
what
twenty
millions
to
a
man
who
controls
the
united
mints
of
north
america
demanded
aladdin
but
if
you
keep
me
here
i
shall
not
control
the
united
mints
of
north
america
shouted
bondifeller
pounding
the
table
just
a
little
on
his
own
account
john
midas
and
silas
reddymun
have
combined
against
me
and
if
i
am
not
at
the
board
meeting
at
ten
this
morning
i
am
down
and
out
phew
whistled
aladdin
by
jove
major
i
glad
you
mentioned
it
in
time
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
show
you
just
what
this
power
of
mine
amounts
to
he
rubbed
the
lamp
and
the
genie
appeared
i
desire
the
immediate
presence
here
of
colonel
john
midas
and
silas
reddymun
sambo
said
aladdin
to
hear
is
to
obey
replied
the
slave
making
off
you
do
mean
to
say
gasped
bondifeller
major
bondifeller
said
aladdin
i
am
not
the
saying
kind
i
am
a
plain
common
garden
doer
i
admit
that
this
time
i
am
stretching
things
a
point
but
you
find
my
orders
are
obeyed
as
indeed
they
were
to
the
astonishment
of
all
concerned
not
even
excepting
aladdin
himself
who
trembled
at
the
audacity
of
his
last
command
within
forty
minutes
the
two
gasping
financiers
whose
presence
had
been
commanded
sat
before
them
the
genii
had
apparently
taken
them
just
as
they
found
them
for
reddymun
still
wore
his
and
midas
was
in
his
with
only
one
side
of
his
face
shaved
illustration
what
does
this
mean
they
demanded
what
the
devil
does
this
mean
they
demanded
in
scarcely
varying
terms
it
means
said
aladdin
calmly
now
very
sure
of
himself
as
he
had
every
right
to
be
considering
the
already
successful
manifestation
of
his
powers
it
means
gentlemen
that
the
united
mints
of
north
america
have
passed
into
the
control
of
a
dark
horse
who
is
familiarly
known
to
himself
as
aladdin
duc
di
lumière
and
that
unless
you
magnates
get
together
inside
of
one
hour
and
do
something
to
clean
up
the
squalor
and
misery
of
this
city
as
represented
by
these
cesspools
of
humanity
termed
the
tenement
districts
you
will
spend
the
balance
of
your
days
in
something
worse
it
is
now
minutes
past
eight
you
may
go
into
executive
session
at
eight
and
at
nine
i
shall
be
ready
to
escort
you
either
to
your
at
the
office
of
the
united
mints
of
north
america
or
to
the
dark
but
wholly
secure
vaults
that
i
have
designed
for
your
accommodation
in
the
subterranean
suburbs
of
this
little
burg
with
these
words
aladdin
departed
at
noon
that
day
monsieur
le
duc
di
lumière
with
his
mother
the
countess
de
bougie
and
suite
arrived
at
the
gotham
hotel
there
is
a
telegram
for
your
grace
observed
the
proprietor
as
he
entered
the
royal
salon
he
handed
over
the
little
yellow
envelope
aladdin
tore
it
open
hastily
and
read
le
duc
di
lumière
the
board
of
directors
of
the
united
mints
of
north
america
have
secured
control
of
sixty
blocks
in
the
heart
of
the
tenement
district
of
new
york
and
will
begin
at
once
the
erection
of
thirty
model
tenement
houses
costing
two
million
apiece
each
building
fronting
on
all
four
sides
upon
a
complete
city
square
to
be
devoted
to
public
parks
for
the
people
and
playgrounds
for

bondifeller
a
year
later
while
aladdin
and
bondifeller
were
returning
from
the
opening
ceremonies
of
the
wonderful
new
tenements
of
lower
new
york
in
the
latter
motor
the
aged
financier
gave
his
young
friend
hand
a
quick
and
affectionate
pressure
duke
said
he
his
voice
trembling
with
happiness
you
have
made
me
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
when
i
looked
out
upon
the
sea
of
faces
of
those
tenants
of
our
new
houses
as
you
made
your
address
and
saw
the
look
of
hope
in
eyes
that
a
year
ago
were
filled
with
threatening
and
despair
it
gave
me
such
a
thrill
as
i
never
had
before
is
there
anything
else
you
can
suggest
wherein
a
man
can
use
a
few
more
millions
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
yes
said
aladdin
now
that
you
have
done
something
for
the
poor
a
few
millions
spent
for
the
amelioration
of
the
habits
of
the
rich
would
be
a
great
boon
and
how
would
you
go
about
it
asked
the
old
man
i
do
know
major
replied
aladdin
it
is
a
much
harder
proposition
than
the
other
and
meanwhile
said
the
old
man
tremulously
how
can
i
show
my
own
gratitude
to
you
personally
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
aladdin
looked
across
the
car
at
the
fair
face
of
marjorie
bondifeller
whose
lovely
eyes
fell
as
they
caught
his
glance
well
said
aladdin
blushing
a
rosy
red
you
might
make
me
your
son
ah
my
boy
sighed
the
major
as
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
am
afraid
that
is
impossible
i
do
think
your
mother
would
marry
a
old
curmudgeon
like
me
i
been
a
widower
for
so
many
years
now
that
i
have
become
set
in
my
ways
and
but
there
another
way
round
ai
there
cried
aladdin
and
there
was
and
that
is
how
my
dear
children
marjorie
bondifeller
happened
to
become
the
duchess
