stonewall

to
my
father
introduction
before
the
great
republic
of
the
west
had
completed
a
century
of
independent
national
existence
its
political
fabric
was
subjected
to
the
strain
of
a
terrible
internecine
war
that
the
true
cause
of
conflict
was
the
antagonism
between
the
spirit
of
federalism
and
the
theory
of
states
rights
is
very
clearly
explained
in
the
following
pages
and
the
author
exactly
expresses
the
feeling
with
which
most
englishmen
regard
the
question
of
secession
when
he
implies
that
had
he
been
a
new
englander
he
would
have
fought
to
the
death
to
preserve
the
union
while
had
he
been
born
in
virginia
he
would
have
done
as
much
in
defence
of
a
right
the
south
believed
inalienable
the
war
thus
brought
about
dragged
on
its
weary
length
from
the
spring
of
to
the
same
season
of
during
its
progress
reputations
were
made
that
will
live
for
ever
in
american
history
and
many
remarkable
men
came
to
the
front
among
these
not
the
least
prominent
was
stonewall
jackson
who
to
the
renown
of
a
great
soldier
and
unselfish
patriot
added
the
brighter
fame
of
a
christian
hero
and
to
those
who
would
know
what
manner
of
man
this
stonewall
jackson
was
and
why
he
was
so
universally
revered
so
beloved
so
trusted
by
his
men
i
can
cordially
recommend
colonel
henderson
delightful
volumes
from
their
perusal
i
have
derived
real
pleasure
and
sound
instruction
they
have
taught
me
much
they
have
made
me
think
still
more
and
i
hope
they
may
do
the
same
for
many
others
in
the
british
army
they
are
worth
the
closest
study
for
few
military
writers
have
possessed
colonel
henderson
grasp
of
tactical
and
strategical
principles
or
his
knowledge
of
the
methods
which
have
controlled
their
application
by
the
most
famous
soldiers
from
hannibal
to
von
moltke
gifted
with
a
rare
power
of
describing
not
only
great
military
events
but
the
localities
where
they
occurred
he
places
clearly
before
his
readers
in
logical
sequence
the
circumstances
which
brought
them
about
he
has
accomplished
too
the
difficult
task
of
combining
with
a
brilliant
and
critical
history
of
a
great
war
the
of
a
great
commander
of
a
most
singular
and
remarkable
man
the
figure
the
character
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
famous
virginian
as
well
as
the
lofty
motives
which
influenced
him
throughout
are
most
sympathetically
portrayed
there
have
been
few
more
fitted
by
natural
instincts
by
education
by
study
and
by
to
become
leaders
of
men
than
stonewall
jackson
from
the
day
he
joined
that
admirable
school
at
west
point
he
may
be
said
to
have
trained
himself
mentally
morally
and
physically
for
the
position
to
which
he
aspired
and
which
it
would
seem
he
always
believed
he
would
reach
shy
as
a
lad
reserved
as
a
man
speaking
little
but
thinking
much
he
led
his
own
life
devouring
the
experiences
of
great
men
as
recorded
in
military
history
in
order
that
when
his
time
came
he
should
be
capable
of
handling
his
troops
as
they
did
a
man
of
very
simple
tastes
and
habits
but
of
strong
religious
principles
drawn
directly
from
the
bible
a
child
in
purity
a
child
in
faith
the
almighty
always
in
his
thoughts
his
stay
in
trouble
his
guide
in
every
difficulty
jackson
individuality
was
more
striking
and
more
complete
than
that
of
all
others
who
played
leading
parts
in
the
great
tragedy
of
secession
the
most
reckless
and
irreligious
of
the
confederate
soldiers
were
silent
in
his
presence
and
stood
awestruck
and
abashed
before
this
great
man
and
even
in
the
northern
states
the
hatred
of
the
formidable
rebel
was
tempered
by
an
irrepressible
admiration
of
his
piety
his
sincerity
and
his
resolution
the
passions
then
naturally
excited
have
now
calmed
down
and
are
remembered
no
more
by
a
reunited
and
chivalrous
nation
with
that
innate
love
of
virtue
and
real
worth
which
has
always
distinguished
the
american
people
there
has
long
been
growing
up
even
among
those
who
were
the
fiercest
foes
of
the
south
a
feeling
of
love
and
reverence
for
the
memory
of
this
great
and
man
of
war
who
fell
in
what
he
firmly
believed
to
be
a
sacred
cause
the
fame
of
stonewall
jackson
is
no
longer
the
exclusive
property
of
virginia
and
the
south
it
has
become
the
birthright
of
every
man
privileged
to
call
himself
an
american
colonel
henderson
has
made
a
special
study
of
the
secession
war
and
it
would
be
difficult
in
my
opinion
to
find
a
man
better
qualified
in
every
respect
for
the
task
he
has
undertaken
i
may
express
the
hope
that
he
will
soon
give
us
the
history
of
the
war
from
the
death
of
stonewall
jackson
to
the
fall
of
richmond
extending
as
it
did
over
a
period
of
four
years
and
marked
by
achievements
which
are
a
lasting
honour
to
the
name
the
struggle
of
the
south
for
independence
is
from
every
point
of
view
one
of
the
most
important
events
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
and
it
should
not
be
left
half
told
until
the
battle
where
stonewall
jackson
fell
the
tide
of
success
was
flowing
and
had
borne
the
flag
of
the
new
confederacy
within
sight
of
the
gates
of
washington
colonel
henderson
deals
only
with
what
i
think
may
be
called
the
period
of
southern
victories
for
the
tide
began
to
ebb
when
jackson
fell
and
those
who
read
his
volumes
will
i
am
convinced
look
forward
eagerly
to
his
story
of
the
years
which
followed
when
grant
with
the
skill
of
a
practised
strategist
threw
a
net
round
the
confederate
capital
drawing
it
gradually
together
until
he
imprisoned
its
starving
garrison
and
compelled
lee
the
ablest
commander
of
his
day
to
surrender
at
discretion
but
the
application
of
strategical
and
tactical
principles
and
the
example
of
noble
lives
are
not
the
only
or
even
the
most
valuable
lessons
of
great
wars
there
are
lessons
which
concern
nations
rather
than
individuals
and
there
are
two
to
be
learnt
from
the
secession
war
which
are
of
peculiar
value
to
both
england
and
the
united
states
whose
armies
are
comparatively
small
and
raised
by
voluntary
enlistment
the
first
is
the
necessity
of
maintaining
at
all
times
for
it
is
impossible
to
predict
what
tomorrow
may
have
in
store
for
us
a
standing
army
in
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
composed
of
and
men
this
army
to
be
large
enough
for
our
military
requirements
and
adapted
to
the
character
the
habits
and
the
traditions
of
the
people
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
whole
force
should
be
actually
serving
during
peace
one
half
of
it
provided
it
is
periodically
drilled
and
exercised
can
be
formed
into
a
reserve
the
essential
thing
is
that
it
should
be
as
perfect
a
weapon
as
can
be
forged
the
second
lesson
is
that
to
hand
over
to
civilians
the
administration
and
organisation
of
the
army
whether
in
peace
or
in
war
or
to
allow
them
to
interfere
in
the
selection
of
officers
for
command
or
promotion
is
most
injurious
to
efficiency
while
during
war
to
allow
them
no
matter
how
high
their
political
capacity
to
dictate
to
commanders
in
the
field
any
line
of
conduct
after
the
army
has
once
received
its
commission
is
simply
to
ensure
disaster
the
first
of
these
lessons
is
brought
home
to
us
by
the
opening
events
of
this
unreasonably
protracted
war
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
most
military
students
will
admit
that
had
the
united
states
been
able
early
in
to
put
into
the
field
in
addition
to
their
volunteers
one
army
corps
of
regular
troops
the
war
would
have
ended
in
a
few
months
an
enormous
expenditure
of
life
and
money
as
well
as
a
serious
dislocation
and
loss
of
trade
would
have
been
thus
avoided
never
have
the
evil
consequences
which
follow
upon
the
absence
of
an
adequate
and
army
been
more
forcibly
exemplified
but
alas
when
this
lesson
is
preached
in
a
country
governed
alternately
by
rival
political
parties
and
when
there
is
no
immediate
prospect
of
national
danger
it
falls
on
deaf
ears
the
demands
made
by
the
soldiers
to
put
the
army
on
a
thoroughly
efficient
footing
are
persistently
ignored
for
the
necessary
means
are
almost
invariably
required
for
some
other
object
more
popular
at
the
moment
and
in
a
parliamentary
or
party
sense
more
useful
the
most
scathing
comment
on
such
a
system
of
administration
is
furnished
in
the
story
told
by
colonel
henderson
the
fearful
trials
to
which
the
united
states
were
subjected
expose
the
folly
and
of
which
even
party
leaders
are
too
often
capable
ministers
bluster
about
fighting
and
yet
refuse
to
spend
enough
money
on
the
army
to
make
it
fit
for
use
and
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
the
lessons
taught
by
the
peninsula
the
crimea
and
the
secession
war
are
but
seldom
remembered
the
pleasing
notion
that
whenever
war
comes
money
can
obtain
for
the
nation
all
that
it
requires
is
still
it
would
seem
an
article
of
at
least
with
the
politicians
of
the
race
throughout
the
world
gold
will
certainly
buy
a
nation
powder
pills
and
provisions
but
no
amount
of
wealth
even
when
supported
by
a
patriotic
willingness
to
enlist
can
buy
discipline
training
and
skilful
leading
without
these
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
an
efficient
army
and
success
in
the
field
against
serious
opposition
is
merely
the
idle
dream
of
those
who
know
not
war
if
any
nation
could
improvise
an
army
at
short
notice
it
would
be
the
united
states
for
its
men
all
round
are
more
hardy
more
and
quicker
to
learn
than
those
of
older
communities
but
notwithstanding
this
advantage
both
in
and
the
united
states
failed
to
create
the
thoroughly
efficient
armies
so
suddenly
required
and
in
both
instances
the
unnecessary
sufferings
of
the
private
soldier
were
the
price
paid
for
the
weakness
and
folly
of
the
politicians
in
the
governors
of
the
several
northern
states
were
ordered
to
call
for
volunteers
to
enlist
for
ninety
days
the
men
electing
their
own
officers
it
was
generally
believed
throughout
the
north
that
all
southern
resistance
would
collapse
before
the
great
armies
that
would
thus
be
raised
but
the
troops
sent
out
to
crush
the
rebellion
when
they
first
came
under
fire
were
soldiers
only
in
outward
garb
and
at
bull
run
face
to
face
with
shot
and
shell
they
soon
lapsed
into
the
condition
of
a
terrified
rabble
and
ran
away
from
another
rabble
almost
equally
demoralised
and
this
not
because
they
were
cowards
for
they
were
of
the
same
breed
as
the
young
regular
soldiers
who
retreated
from
the
same
field
in
such
excellent
order
but
because
they
neither
understood
what
discipline
was
nor
the
necessity
for
it
and
because
the
staff
and
regimental
officers
with
few
exceptions
were
untrained
and
inexperienced
davis
having
prevented
the
southern
army
from
following
up
the
victory
at
bull
run
gave
the
northern
states
some
breathing
time
lincoln
was
thus
able
to
raise
a
new
army
of
over
men
for
the
projected
advance
on
richmond
the
new
army
was
liberally
supplied
with
guns
pontoons
balloons
hospitals
and
waggons
but
with
the
exception
of
a
few
officers
spared
from
the
regular
army
it
was
without
trained
soldiers
to
lead
it
or
staff
officers
to
move
and
to
administer
its
divisions
it
must
be
admitted
i
think
that
general
mcclellan
did
all
that
a
man
could
do
in
the
way
of
training
this
huge
mass
but
when
the
day
came
for
it
to
move
forward
it
was
still
unfit
for
an
offensive
campaign
against
a
regular
army
to
the
practised
eye
of
an
able
and
experienced
soldier
who
accompanied
mcclellan
the
federal
host
was
an
army
only
in
name
he
likened
it
to
a
giant
lying
prone
upon
the
earth
in
appearance
a
hercules
but
wanting
the
bone
the
muscle
and
the
nervous
organisation
necessary
to
set
the
great
frame
in
motion
even
when
the
army
was
landed
in
the
peninsula
although
the
process
of
training
and
organisation
had
been
going
on
for
over
six
months
it
was
still
a
most
unwieldy
force
fortunately
for
the
union
the
confederate
army
except
as
regards
the
superior
leaders
and
the
cavalry
was
hardly
more
efficient
the
united
states
fully
realising
their
need
of
a
larger
regular
army
are
now
on
the
point
of
increasing
their
existing
force
to
treble
its
present
strength
their
troops
like
our
own
are
raised
by
voluntary
enlistment
for
a
short
period
of
service
with
the
colours
england
has
always
very
great
difficulty
in
filling
the
ranks
even
with
undeveloped
youths
the
united
states
obtain
as
many
men
as
they
require
because
they
have
the
wisdom
to
pay
their
men
well
on
a
scale
corresponding
to
the
market
rate
of
wages
here
they
are
fortunate
but
men
are
not
everything
and
i
will
still
draw
the
moral
that
a
nation
is
more
than
blind
when
it
deliberately
elects
to
entrust
its
defence
to
an
army
that
is
not
as
perfect
as
training
and
discipline
can
make
it
that
is
not
led
by
practised
officers
staff
and
regimental
and
that
is
not
provided
with
a
powerful
and
efficient
artillery
overwhelming
disaster
is
in
store
for
such
nation
if
it
be
attacked
by
a
large
regular
army
and
when
it
falls
there
will
be
none
to
pity
to
hang
the
ministers
who
led
them
astray
and
who
believed
they
knew
better
than
any
soldier
how
the
army
should
be
administered
will
be
but
poor
consolation
to
an
angry
and
deluded
people
let
me
now
dwell
briefly
upon
the
second
of
the
two
great
national
lessons
taught
by
the
secession
war
i
shall
say
nothing
here
upon
civilian
meddling
with
army
organisation
and
with
the
selection
of
officers
for
command
but
i
wish
particularly
to
point
out
the
result
of
interference
on
the
part
of
a
legislative
assembly
or
minister
with
the
plans
and
dispositions
of
the
generals
commanding
in
the
field
take
first
the
notorious
instance
of
interference
with
mcclellan
in
the
spring
of
mcclellan
who
was
selected
to
command
the
army
which
was
to
capture
richmond
and
end
the
war
was
a
soldier
of
known
ability
and
in
my
opinion
if
he
had
not
been
interfered
with
by
the
cabinet
in
washington
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
it
is
true
as
colonel
henderson
has
said
that
he
made
a
mistake
in
not
playing
up
to
susceptibilities
with
regard
to
the
safety
of
the
federal
capital
but
lincoln
made
a
far
greater
mistake
in
suddenly
reducing
mcclellan
army
by
men
and
by
removing
banks
from
his
jurisdiction
when
the
plan
of
campaign
had
been
approved
by
the
cabinet
and
it
was
already
too
late
to
change
it
it
is
possible
considering
the
political
situation
that
the
garrison
of
washington
was
too
small
and
it
was
certainly
inefficient
but
the
best
way
of
protecting
washington
was
to
give
mcclellan
the
means
of
advancing
rapidly
upon
richmond
such
an
advance
would
have
made
a
confederate
counterstroke
against
the
northern
capital
or
even
a
demonstration
impossible
but
to
take
away
from
mcclellan
men
the
very
force
with
which
he
intended
to
turn
the
yorktown
lines
and
drive
the
enemy
back
on
richmond
and
at
the
same
time
to
isolate
banks
in
the
shenandoah
valley
was
simply
playing
into
the
enemy
hands
what
lincoln
did
not
see
was
that
to
divide
the
federal
army
into
three
portions
working
on
three
separate
lines
was
to
run
a
far
greater
risk
than
would
be
incurred
by
leaving
washington
weakly
garrisoned
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
he
in
the
least
realised
all
that
was
involved
in
changing
a
plan
of
operations
so
vast
as
mcclellan
again
look
at
the
folly
of
which
benjamin
the
confederate
secretary
of
war
was
guilty
at
the
same
period
the
reader
should
carefully
study
the
chapter
in
which
colonel
henderson
describes
stonewall
jackson
resignation
of
his
command
when
his
arrangements
in
the
field
were
altered
without
his
cognizance
by
the
secretary
of
war
i
should
like
to
emphasise
his
words
that
the
soldier
he
says
is
but
the
servant
of
the
statesman
as
war
is
but
an
instrument
of
diplomacy
no
educated
soldier
will
deny
politics
must
always
exercise
a
supreme
influence
on
strategy
yet
it
can
not
be
gainsaid
that
interference
with
the
commander
in
the
field
is
fraught
with
the
gravest
danger
volume
chapter
the
absolute
truth
of
this
remark
is
proved
not
only
by
many
instances
in
his
own
volumes
but
by
the
history
of
war
in
all
ages
and
the
principle
for
which
jackson
contended
when
he
sent
in
his
resignation
would
seem
too
well
founded
to
be
open
to
the
slightest
question
yet
there
are
those
who
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
neglect
of
this
principle
has
been
always
responsible
for
protracted
wars
for
useless
slaughter
and
costly
failures
still
insist
on
the
omniscience
of
statesmen
who
regard
the
protest
of
the
soldier
as
the
mere
outcome
of
injured
vanity
and
believe
that
politics
must
suffer
unless
the
politician
controls
strategy
as
well
as
the
finances
colonel
henderson
pages
supply
an
instructive
commentary
on
these
ideas
in
the
first
three
years
of
the
secession
war
when
lincoln
and
stanton
practically
controlled
the
movements
of
the
federal
forces
the
confederates
were
generally
successful
further
the
most
glorious
epoch
of
the
confederacy
was
the
critical
period
of
when
lee
was
allowed
to
exercise
the
full
authority
of
and
lastly
the
northern
prospects
did
not
begin
to
brighten
until
lincoln
in
march
with
that
unselfish
intelligence
which
distinguished
him
abdicated
his
military
functions
in
favour
of
general
grant
and
yet
while
lee
and
grant
had
a
free
hand
over
the
military
resources
of
their
respective
nations
the
political
situation
suffered
no
harm
whatever
no
extravagant
demands
were
made
upon
the
exchequer
and
the
government
derived
fresh
strength
from
the
successes
of
the
armies
the
truth
is
that
a
certain
class
of
civilians
can
not
rid
themselves
of
the
suspicion
that
soldiers
are
consumed
by
an
inordinate
and
bloodthirsty
ambition
they
can
not
understand
that
a
man
brought
up
from
his
youth
to
render
loyal
obedience
is
less
likely
than
most
others
to
run
counter
to
constituted
authority
they
will
not
see
that
a
soldier
pride
in
his
own
army
and
in
the
manhood
of
his
own
race
tends
to
make
him
a
devoted
patriot
they
do
not
realise
that
a
commander
familiarity
with
war
whether
gained
by
study
or
experience
must
unless
his
ability
be
limited
enable
him
to
accommodate
his
strategy
to
political
exigencies
nor
will
they
admit
that
he
can
possess
a
due
sense
of
economy
although
none
knows
better
than
an
educated
soldier
the
part
played
in
war
by
a
sound
and
thrifty
administration
of
the
national
resources
the
soldier
on
the
other
hand
knows
that
his
art
is
most
difficult
that
to
apply
strategical
principles
correctly
experience
study
knowledge
of
men
and
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
questions
of
supply
transport
and
the
movement
of
masses
are
absolutely
necessary
he
is
aware
that
what
may
seem
matters
of
small
moment
to
the
civilian
such
as
the
position
of
a
brigade
the
strength
of
a
garrison
the
command
of
a
detachment
may
affect
the
whole
course
of
a
campaign
and
consequently
even
if
he
had
not
the
historical
examples
of
aulic
councils
and
other
such
assemblies
to
warn
him
he
would
rebel
against
the
meddling
of
amateurs
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
an
enormous
responsibility
rests
on
the
shoulders
of
a
commander
in
the
field
the
honour
of
army
committed
to
his
charge
the
lives
of
the
brave
men
under
him
perhaps
the
existence
of
his
country
and
that
failure
even
if
he
can
plead
that
he
only
obeyed
the
orders
of
his
government
or
that
he
was
supplied
with
inadequate
means
will
be
laid
at
his
door
mcdowell
received
no
mercy
after
bull
run
although
he
had
protested
against
attacking
the
confederates
and
it
was
long
before
the
reputation
of
sir
john
moore
was
cleared
in
the
eyes
of
the
english
people
such
to
my
mind
are
the
most
important
lessons
to
be
drawn
from
this
history
of
the
first
period
of
the
secession
war
but
it
is
not
alone
to
draw
attention
to
the
teaching
on
these
points
that
i
have
acceded
as
an
old
friend
to
colonel
henderson
request
that
i
should
write
an
introduction
to
his
second
edition
in
these
days
of
sensational
literature
and
superficial
study
there
is
a
prejudice
against
the
story
that
fills
more
than
one
volume
but
the
reader
who
opens
these
pages
is
so
carried
away
by
the
intense
interest
of
the
subject
clothed
as
it
is
in
forcible
and
yet
graceful
language
that
he
closes
them
with
regret
and
i
am
only
too
glad
to
ask
others
to
share
the
very
great
pleasure
i
have
myself
enjoyed
in
reading
them
i
know
of
no
book
which
will
add
more
largely
to
the
knowledge
of
strategy
and
the
art
of
war
and
the
ordinary
reader
will
find
in
this
life
of
stonewall
jackson
true
and
accurate
as
it
is
all
the
charm
and
fascination
of
a
great
historical
romance
preface
to
write
the
life
of
a
great
general
to
analyse
his
methods
of
war
and
discipline
to
appraise
the
weight
of
his
responsibilities
and
to
measure
the
extent
of
his
capacity
it
would
seem
essential
that
the
experience
of
the
writer
should
have
run
on
parallel
lines
an
ordinary
soldier
therefore
who
notwithstanding
his
lack
of
such
experience
attempts
the
task
may
be
justly
accused
of
something
worse
than
presumption
but
if
we
were
to
wait
for
those
who
are
really
qualified
to
deal
with
the
achievements
of
famous
captains
we
should
as
a
rule
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
lessons
of
their
lives
for
men
of
the
requisite
capacity
are
few
in
a
generation
so
the
task
if
it
is
to
be
done
at
all
must
perforce
be
left
to
those
who
have
less
knowledge
but
more
leisure
in
the
present
case
however
the
mass
of
contemporary
testimony
is
so
large
that
any
initial
disadvantages
i
venture
to
think
will
be
less
conspicuous
than
they
might
otherwise
have
been
the
official
records
of
the
war
of
the
rebellion
contain
every
dispatch
letter
and
message
public
or
confidential
which
has
been
preserved
and
in
the
daily
correspondence
of
the
generals
on
both
sides
together
with
the
voluminous
reports
of
officers
of
all
grades
the
tale
of
the
campaigns
is
written
so
plain
that
none
can
fail
to
read
again
stonewall
jackson
military
career
either
in
full
or
in
part
has
been
narrated
by
more
than
one
of
his
staff
officers
whose
intercourse
with
him
was
necessarily
close
and
constant
and
in
addition
the
literature
of
the
war
abounds
with
articles
and
sketches
contributed
by
soldiers
of
all
ranks
who
at
one
time
or
another
served
under
his
command
it
has
been
my
privilege
moreover
to
visit
the
of
virginia
with
men
who
rode
by
his
side
when
he
won
his
victories
to
hear
on
the
spot
the
description
of
his
manoeuvres
of
his
bearing
under
fire
and
of
his
influence
over
his
troops
i
can
thus
make
fairly
certain
that
my
facts
are
accurate
but
in
endeavouring
to
ascertain
the
strength
of
the
armies
at
different
periods
i
have
been
less
fortunate
for
the
most
part
i
have
rested
on
the
official
referred
to
in
the
text
as
it
is
to
be
regretted
however
that
so
far
as
the
confederates
are
concerned
there
are
several
gaps
in
the
series
of
returns
and
i
have
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
arrive
at
a
fair
estimate
of
the
approximate
strength
at
any
period
within
these
intervals
for
instance
the
numbers
at
lee
disposal
at
the
end
of
august
rest
on
the
basis
of
a
return
dated
july
and
in
the
meantime
several
regiments
and
batteries
had
been
transferred
elsewhere
while
others
had
been
added
i
have
done
my
best
however
to
trace
all
such
changes
and
where
officers
and
employed
men
are
not
included
in
the
returns
i
have
been
careful
to
add
a
normal
percentage
to
the
official
totals
as
regards
jackson
place
in
history
my
labours
have
been
greatly
facilitated
by
the
published
opinions
of
many
distinguished
soldiers
american
english
french
and
german
and
i
have
endeavoured
at
every
step
as
the
surest
means
of
arriving
at
a
just
conclusion
to
compare
his
conduct
of
military
affairs
with
that
of
the
acknowledged
masters
of
war
his
private
life
from
his
boyhood
onwards
has
been
so
admirably
depicted
by
his
memoirs
of
stonewall
jackson
the
prentice
press
louisville
kentucky
that
i
have
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
select
from
her
pages
such
incidents
and
letters
as
appear
best
suited
to
illustrate
his
character
and
to
add
a
few
traits
and
anecdotes
communicated
by
his
personal
friends
several
biographies
have
already
been
published
and
that
written
by
the
late
reverend
dabney
sometime
major
in
the
confederate
army
and
jackson
chief
of
the
staff
for
several
months
is
so
complete
and
powerful
that
the
need
of
a
successor
is
not
at
once
apparent
this
work
however
was
brought
out
before
the
war
had
ceased
and
notwithstanding
his
intimate
relations
with
his
hero
it
was
impossible
for
the
author
to
attain
that
fulness
and
precision
of
statement
which
the
study
of
the
official
records
can
alone
ensure
nor
was
dabney
a
witness
of
all
the
events
he
so
vigorously
described
it
is
only
fitting
however
that
i
should
acknowledge
the
debt
i
owe
to
a
soldier
and
writer
of
such
conspicuous
ability
not
only
have
i
quoted
freely
from
his
pages
but
he
was
good
enough
at
my
request
to
write
exhaustive
memoranda
on
many
episodes
of
jackson
career
cooke
life
of
jackson
is
still
popular
and
deservedly
so
but
cooke
like
dabney
had
no
access
to
the
official
records
and
his
narrative
of
the
battles
picturesque
and
lifelike
as
it
is
can
hardly
be
accepted
as
sober
history
on
the
other
hand
the
several
works
of
the
late
colonel
william
allan
in
collaboration
with
major
hotchkiss
are
as
remarkable
for
their
research
and
accuracy
as
for
their
military
acumen
while
the
volumes
of
the
southern
historical
society
together
with
the
remarkable
series
of
articles
entitled
battles
and
leaders
of
the
civil
war
written
by
the
leading
participants
on
either
side
are
a
perfect
mine
of
wealth
to
the
historical
student
i
need
hardly
add
that
the
memoirs
and
biographies
of
both
the
federal
and
confederate
generals
of
lee
grant
stuart
sherman
johnston
longstreet
beauregard
mcclellan
hancock
pendleton
and
others
are
a
necessary
complement
to
the
official
records
nevertheless
with
all
this
mass
of
information
at
my
command
had
it
not
been
for
the
exceeding
kindness
of
the
friends
and
comrades
of
stonewall
jackson
i
much
doubt
whether
i
should
have
been
able
to
complete
my
task
to
the
late
major
hotchkiss
his
trusted
staff
officer
whatever
of
value
these
volumes
may
contain
is
largely
due
not
only
did
he
correct
the
topographical
descriptions
but
he
investigated
most
carefully
many
disputed
points
and
in
procuring
the
evidence
of
and
thus

to

and

the
statements

most
kind
in

to
my
many
questions
to
hildyard
late
commandant
of

college
i
am
indebted
for
much
valuable
criticism
on
the
campaigns
of
and
my
warmest
thanks
are
here
tendered
to
the
lord
wolseley
for
much
information
and
more
encouragement
i
can
not
conceal
from
myself
however
that
notwithstanding
the
numerous
authorities
i
have
been
enabled
to
consult
as
well
as
the
intrinsic
interest
of
my
subject
many
of
the
following
chapters
will
be
found
excessively
dull
by
civilian
readers
stonewall
military
career
was
not
all
hard
fighting
nor
was
it
on
the
battlefield
alone
that
his
supreme
ability
for
war
was
made
manifest
his
time
and
thoughts
were
more
occupied
by
strategy
that
is
by
combinations
made
out
of
the
enemy
sight
than
by
tactics
that
is
by
manoeuvres
executed
in
the
enemy
presence
but
strategy
unfortunately
is
an
unpopular
science
even
among
soldiers
requiring
both
in
practice
and
in
demonstration
constant
and
careful
study
of
the
map
the
closest
computation
of
time
and
space
a
grasp
of
many
factors
and
the
strictest
attention
to
the
various
steps
in
the
problems
it
presents
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
science
which
repays
the
student
although
he
may
have
no
direct
concern
with
military
affairs
for
not
only
will
a
comprehension
of
its
immutable
principles
add
a
new
interest
to
the
records
of
stirring
times
and
great
achievements
but
it
will
make
him
a
more
useful
citizen
in
free
countries
like
great
britain
her
colonies
and
the
united
states
the
weight
of
intelligent
opinion
in
all
matters
of
moment
generally
turns
the
scale
and
if
it
were
generally
understood
that
in
regular
warfare
success
depends
on
something
more
than
rank
and
experience
no
government
would
dare
entrust
the
command
of
the
army
to
any
other
than
the
most
competent
soldier
the
campaigns
of
the
civil
war
show
how
much
may
be
achieved
even
with
relatively
feeble
means
by
men
who
have
both
studied
strategy
and
have
the
character
necessary
for
its
successful
practice
and
they
also
show
not
a
whit
less
forcibly
what
awful
sacrifices
may
be
exacted
from
a
nation
ignorant
that
such
a
science
exists
and
such
ignorance
is
widespread
how
seldom
do
we
hear
a
knowledge
of
strategy
referred
to
as
an
indispensable
acquirement
in
those
who
aspire
to
high
command
how
often
is
it
repeated
although
in
so
doing
the
speakers
betray
their
own
shortcomings
that
strategy
is
a
mere
matter
of
yet
the
plain
truth
is
that
strategy
is
not
only
the
determining
factor
in
civilised
warfare
but
that
in
order
to
apply
its
principles
the
soundest
must
be
most
carefully
trained
of
all
the
sciences
connected
with
war
it
is
the
most
difficult
if
the
names
of
the
great
captains
soldiers
and
sailors
be
recalled
it
will
be
seen
that
it
is
to
the
breadth
of
their
strategical
conceptions
rather
than
to
their
tactical
skill
that
they
owe
their
fame
an
analysis
of
the
great
wars
shows
that
their
course
was
generally
marked
by
the
same
vicissitudes
first
we
have
the
great
strategist
a
hannibal
or
a
napoleon
or
a
lee
triumphing
with
inferior
numbers
over
adversaries
who
are
tacticians
and
nothing
more
then
suddenly
the
tide
of
victory
is
checked
and
brilliant
manoeuvres
no
longer
avail
fabius
and
scipio
wellington
nelson
and
vincent
grant
sherman
and
farragut
have
replaced
the
mere
tacticians
and
the
superior
resources
wielded
with
strategical
skill
exert
their
inevitable
effect
or
it
may
be
that
fortune
is
constant
throughout
to
her
first
favourite
and
that
a
marlborough
a
frederick
a
washington
a

marches

it
is
impossible
then
to
estimate
the
ability
of
any
general
without
considering
his
strategy
moreover
in
this
age
of
inventions
of

and
of

rapid
communication
the
science
is
more
complicated
and
even
more
important
than

and
it
is
deserving
therefore
of
far
closer
attention
from
both
soldiers
and
civilians
than
it
has
hitherto
received
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
i
have
described
and

in

minute
detail
the
strategy
of
the
campaigns
with
which
jackson
had

have
only
to
add
that
should
anything
in

any

i
have
always
borne
in

the
words

i
would
like
to
see
truthful
history
written
such
history
will
do
full
credit
to
the
courage
endurance
and
ability
of
the
american
citizen
no
matter
what
section
he
hailed
from
or
in
what
ranks
he
fought
i
am
very
strongly
of
opinion
that
any
man
may
feel
equal
sympathy
with
both
federal
and
confederate
both
were
so
absolutely
convinced
that
their
cause
was
just
that
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
either
northerner
or
southerner
acting
otherwise
than
he
did
if
stonewall
jackson
had
been
a
new
englander
educated
in
the
belief
that
secession
was
rebellion
he
would
assuredly
have
shed
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
in
defence
of
the
union
if
ulysses
grant
had
been
a
virginian
imbibing
the
doctrine
of
states
rights
with
his
milk
it
is
just
as
certain
that
he
would
have
worn
the
confederate
grey
it
is
with
those
northerners
who
would
have
allowed
the
union
to
be
broken
and
with
those
southerners
who
would

in

quarter
of
the
century
on
the
hills
which
stand
above
the
ohio
river
but
in
different
states
of
the
union
were
born
two
children
destined
to
all
appearance
to
lives
of
narrow
interests
and
thankless
toil
they
were
the
sons
of
poor
parents
without
influence
or
expectations
their
native
villages
deep
in
the
solitudes
of
the
west
and
remote
from
the
promise
and
possibilities
of
great
cities
offered
no
road
to
fortune
in
the
days
before
the
railway
escape
from
the
wilderness
except
for
those
with
long
purses
was
very
difficult
and
for
those
who
remained
if
their
means
were
small
the
farm
and
the
store
were
the
only
occupations
but
a
farmer
without
capital
was
little
better
than
a
hired
hand
trade
was
confined
to
the
petty
dealings
of
a
country
market
and
although
thrift
and
energy
even
under
such
depressing
conditions
might
eventually
win
a
competence
the
most
ardent
ambition
could
hardly
hope
for
more
never
was
an
obscure
existence
more
irretrievably
marked
out
than
for
these
children
of
the
ohio
and
yet
before
either
had
grown
grey
the
names
of
abraham
lincoln
president
of
the
united
states
and
of
stonewall
jackson
in
the
confederate
army
were
household
words
in
both
america
and
europe
descendants
of
the
pioneers
those
hardy
borderers
half
soldiers
and
half
farmers
who
held
and
reclaimed
through
long
years
of
indian
warfare
the
valleys
and
prairies
of
the
west
they
inherited
the
best
attributes
of
a
frank
and
valiant
race
simple
yet
wise
strong
yet
gentle
they
were
gifted
with
all
the
qualities
which
make
leaders
of
men
actuated
by
the
highest
principles
they
both
ennobled
the
cause
for
which
they
fought
and
while
the
opposition
of
such
kindred
natures
adds
to
the
dramatic
interest
of
the
civil
war
the
career
of
the
great
soldier
although
a
theme
perhaps
less
generally
attractive
may
be
followed
as
profitably
as
that
of
the
great
statesmen
providence
dealt
with
them
very
differently
the
one
was
struck
down
by
a
mortal
wound
before
his
task
was
well
begun
his
life
to
all
human
seeming
was
given
in
vain
and
his
name
will
ever
be
associated
with
the
mournful
memories
of
a
lost
cause
and
a
vanished
army
the
other
ere
he
fell
beneath
the
assassin
stroke
had
seen
the
abundant
fruits
of
his
mighty
labours
his
sun
set
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
yet
the
resemblance
between
them
is
very
close
both
dared
for
that
sweet
which
gave
them
birth
nobly
to
do
nobly
to
die
their
names
graven
on
memorial
columns
are
a
song
heard
in
the
future
more
than
wall
and
rampart
their
examples
reach
a
hand
far
thro
all
years
and
everywhere
they
meet
and
kindle
generous
purpose
and
the
strength
to
mould
it
into
action
pure
as
theirs
jackson
in
one
respect
was
more
fortunate
than
lincoln
although
born
to
poverty
he
came
of
a
virginia
family
which
was
neither
unknown
nor
undistinguished
and
as
showing
the
influences
which
went
to
form
his
character
its
history
and
traditions
may
be
briefly
related
it
is
an
article
of
popular
belief
that
the
state
of
virginia
the
old
dominion
of
the
british
crown
owes
her
fame
to
the
blood
of
the
english
cavaliers
the
idea
however
has
small
foundation
in
fact
not
a
few
of
her
great
names
are
derived
from
a
less
romantic
source
and
the
confederate
general
like
many
of
his
neighbours
in
the
western
portion
of
the
state
traced
his
origin
to
the
lowlands
of
scotland
an
ingenious
author
of
the
last
century
himself
born
on
declares
that
those
scotch
families
whose
patronymics
end
in
son
although
numerous
and
respectable
and
descended
as
the
distinctive
syllable
denotes
from
the
vikings
have
seldom
been
either
in
peace
or
war
and
certainly
as
regards
the
jacksons
of
bygone
centuries
the
assertion
seems
justified
the
name
is
almost
unknown
to
border
history
in
neither
lay
nor
legend
has
it
been
preserved
and
even
in
the
black
lists
of
the
wardens
where
the
more
enterprising
of
the
community
were
continually
proclaimed
as
thieves
and
malefactors
it
is
seldom
honoured
with
notice
the
omission
might
be
held
as
evidence
that
the
family
was
of
peculiar
honesty
but
in
reality
it
is
only
a
proof
that
it
was
insignificant
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
jacksons
were
one
of
the
landless
clans
whose
only
heritages
were
their
rude
peel
towers
and
who
with
no
acknowledged
chief
of
their
own
race
followed
as
much
for
protection
as
for
plunder
the
banner
of
some
more
powerful
house
in
course
of
time
when
the
marches
grew
peaceful
and
morals
improved
when
no
longer
profitable
ceased
to
be
an
honourable
occupation
such
humbler
marauders
drifted
away
into
the
wide
world
leaving
no
trace
behind
save
the
grey
ruins
of
their
grim
fortalices
and
the
incidental
mention
of
some
probably
disreputable
scion
in
a
chapman
ballad
neither
mark
nor
memory
of
the
jacksons
remains
in
scotland
we
only
know
that
some
members
of
the
clan
impelled
probably
by
religious
persecution
made
their
way
to
ulster
where
a
strong
colony
of
lowlanders
had
already
been
established
under
a
milder
sky
and
a
less
drastic
government
the
expatriated
scots
lost
nothing
of
their
individuality
masterful
and
independent
from
the
beginning
masterful
and
independent
they
remained
inflexible
of
purpose
impatient
of
justice
and
staunch
to
their
ideals
something
perhaps
they
owed
to
contact
with
the
celt
wherever
the
ulster
folk
have
made
their
home
the
breath
of
the
wholesome
north
has
followed
them
preserving
untainted
their
hereditary
virtues
shrewd
practical
and
thrifty
prosperity
has
consistently
rewarded
them
and
yet
in
common
with
the
irishmen
of
english
stock
they
have
found
in
the
trade
of
arms
the
most
congenial
outlet
for
their
energies
an
abiding
love
of
peace
can
hardly
be
enumerated
amongst
their
more
prominent
characteristics
and
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
which
unless
there
is
some
mysterious
property
in
the
air
can
only
be
explained
by
the
intermixture
of
races
that
ireland
within
the
pale
has
been
peculiarly
prolific
of
military
genius
as
england
has
bred
admirals
so
the
sister
isle
has
bred
soldiers
the
tenacious
courage
of
the
blended
with
the
spirit
of
that
people
which
above
all
others
delights
in
war
has
proved
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
a
most
powerful
combination
of
martial
qualities
the
same
mixed
strain
which
gave
england
wolfe
and
wellington
the
napiers
and
the
lawrences
has
given
america
some
of
her
greatest
captains
and
not
the
least
famous
of
her
presidents
is
that
general
jackson
who
won
the
battle
of
new
orleans
in
so
early
in
the
century
the
name
became
known
beyond
the
seas
but
whether
the
same
blood
ran
in
the
veins
of
the
confederate
general
and
of
the
soldier
president
is
a
matter
of
some
doubt
the
former
in
almost
every
single
respect
save
his
warm
heart
was
the
exact
converse
of
the
typical
irishman
the
latter
had
a
hot
temper
and
a
ready
wit
both
however
were
undeniably
fond
of
fighting
and
a
letter
still
preserved
attests
that
their
ancestors
had
lived
in
the
same
parish
of
londonderry
this
letter
is
in
the
possession
of
thomas
jackson
arnold

of

john

the
of
our
hero
landed
in
america
in
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
set
his
face
towards
the
wilderness
the
emigrants
from
ulster
appear
as
a
rule
to
have
moved
westward
the
states
along
the
coast
were
already
colonised
and
despite
its
fertility
the
country
was
little
to
their
taste
but
beyond
the
border
in
the
broad
appalachian
valley
which
runs
from
the
lawrence
to
alabama
on
the
banks
of
the
great
rivers
the
susquehanna
the
ohio
the
cumberland
and
the
tennessee
they
found
a
land
after
their
own
heart
a
soil
with
whose
properties
they
were
familiar
the
sweet
grasses
and
soft
contours
of
their
native
hills
here
too
there
was
ample
room
for
their
communities
for
the
west
was
as
yet
but
sparsely
tenanted
no
inconsiderable
number
penetrating
far
into
the
interior
settled
eventually
about
the
headwaters
of
the
potomac
and
the
james
this
highland
region
was
the
debatable
ground
of
the
united

so
late
as
the
state
of
virginia
extended
no
further
than
the
crests
of
the
blue
ridge
two
hundred
miles
westward
forts
flying
french
colours
dominated
the
valley
of

inhospitable

very
labyrinth

mountains
which
lay
between
was
held
by
the
fierce
tribes
of
the
six
nations
and
the
two
years
later
the
french
had
been
driven
back
to
canada
but
it
was
not
till
near
the
close
of
the
century
that
the
savage
was
finally
dispossessed
of
his
spacious
hunting
grounds
it
was
on
these
green
uplands
where
fight
and
foray
were
as
frequent
as
once
on
the
scottish
border
that
john
jackson
and
his
wife
a
fellow
passenger
to

by

pitched

now
the
of

but
then
no
more
than
a

virginia
backwoods
thomas
jonathan
jackson
was
born
on
january
his
father
was
a
lawyer
clever
and
popular
who
had
inherited
a
comfortable
patrimony
the
new
world
had
been
generous
to
the
jacksons
the
emigrant
of
left
a
valuable
estate
and
his
many
sons
were
uniformly
prosperous
nor
was
their
affluence
the
reward
of
energy
and
thrift
alone
for
the
lands
reclaimed
by
axe
and
plough
were
held
by
a
charter
of
sword
and
musket
the
redskin
fought
hard
for
his
ancestral
domains
the
stockaded
forts
which
stood
as
a
citadel
of
refuge
in
every
settlement
were
often
the
scene
of
fierce
attack
and
weary
leaguer
and
the
nursing
mothers
of
the
frontier
families
were
no
strangers
to
war
and
bloodshed
the
last
great
battle
with
the
indians
east
of
the
ohio
was
fought
in
but
the
military
experience
of
the
pioneers
was
not
confined
to
the
warfare
of
the
border
john
jackson
and
his
sons
bore
arms
in
the
war
of
independence
and
the
trained
riflemen
of
west
virginia
were
welcome
recruits
in
the
colonial
ranks
with
the
exception
of
the
highlanders
of
the
who
had
been
deported
in
droves
to
the
plantations
no
race
had
less
cause
to
remain
loyal
to
the
crown
than
the
men
of
ulster
blood
even
after
the
siege
of
londonderry
they
had
been
proscribed
and
persecuted
and
in
the
war
of
independence
the
fiercest
enemies
of
king
george
were
the
descendants
of
the
same
who
had
held
the
north
of
ireland
for
king
william
in
washington
campaigns
more
than
one
of
the
jacksons
won
rank
and
reputation
and
when
peace
was
established
they
married
into
influential
families
nor
was
the
next
generation
less
successful
judges
senators
and
soldiers
upheld
the
honour
of
the
name
and
proved
the
worth
of
the
ancestral
stock
they
were
marked
it
is
said
by
strong
and
characteristic
features
by
a
warm
feeling
of
clanship
a
capacity
for
hard
work
and
a
decided
love
of
roving
some
became
hunters
others
explorers
and
the
race
is
now
scattered
from
virginia
to
oregon
a
passion
for
litigation
was
a
general
failing
and
none
of
them
could
resist
the
fascination
of
machinery
every
jackson
owned
a
mill
or
factory
of
some
sort
many
of
them
more
than
one
and
their
ventures
were
not
always
profitable
father
among
others
found
it
easier
to
make
money
than
to
keep
it
generous
and
incautious
he
became
deeply
involved
by
becoming
security
for
others
high
play
increased
his
embarrassments
and
when
he
died
in
every
vestige
of
his
property
was
swept
away
his
young
widow
left
with
three
small
children
two
sons
and
a
daughter
became
dependent
on
the
assistance
of
her
kinsfolk
for
a
livelihood
and
on
the
charity
of
the
freemasons
for
a
roof
when
thomas
her
second
son
was
six
years
old
she
married
a
captain
woodson
but
her
second
matrimonial
venture
was
not
more
fortunate
than
her
first
her
husband
means
were
small
and
necessity
soon
compelled
her
to
commit
her
two
boys
to
the
care
of
their
father
relatives
within
a
year
the
children
stood
round
her
dying
bed
and
at
a
very
early
age
our
little
virginian
found
himself
a
penniless
orphan
but
as
he
never
regretted
his
poverty
so
he
never
forgot
his
mother
to
the
latest
hour
of
his
life
he
loved
to
recall
her
memory
and
years
after
she
had
passed
away
her
influence
still
remained
her
beauty
her
counsels
their
last
parting
and
her
happy
death
for
she
was
a
woman
of
deep
religious
feeling
made
a
profound
impression
on
him
to
his
childhood
fancy
she
was
the
embodiment
of
every
grace
and
so
strong
had
been
the
sympathy
between
them
that
even
in
the
midst
of
his
campaigns
she
was
seldom
absent
from
his
thoughts
after
her
death
the
children
found
a
home
with
their
father
who
had
inherited
the
family
estates
and
was
one
of
the
largest
in
the
district
their
surroundings
however
could
hardly
be
called
luxurious
life
on
the
ohio
was
very
different
from
life
on
the
coast
the
western
counties
of
virginia
were
still
practically
on
the
frontier
of
the
united
states
the
axe
had
thinned
the
interminable
woods
mills
were
busy
on
each
mountain
stream
and
the
sunny
valleys
were
rich
in
fruit
and
corn
but
as
yet
there
was
little
traffic
steam
had
not
yet
come
to
open
up
the
wilderness
the
population
was
small
and
widely
scattered
and
the
country
was
cut
off
as
much
by
nature
as
by
distance
from
the
older
civilisation
of
the
east
the
parallel
ranges
of
the
alleghanies
with
their
pathless
forests
and
great
canyons
were
a
formidable
barrier
to
all
intercourse
the
west
was
a
world
in
itself
the
only
outlets
eastward
were
the
valleys
of
the
potomac
and
the
james
the
one
leading
to
washington
the
other
to
richmond
and
so
seldom
were
they
used
that
the
yeomen
of
the
ohio
uplands
were
almost
as
much
opposed
both
in
character
and
in
mode
of
life
to
the
planters
beyond
the
blue
ridge

the
covenanters

guards
although
the
sturdy
independence
and
simple
habits
of
the
borderers
were
not
affected
by
contact
with
wealthier
communities
isolation
was
not
in
every
way
a
blessing
served
by
throngs
of
slaves
the
great
landowners
of
east
virginia
found
leisure
to
cultivate
the
arts
which
make
life
more
pleasant
the
rambling
houses
on
the
banks
of
the

the
rappahannock
and
the

built
on
the
model
of
english
manors
had
their
libraries
and
a
classical
academy
was
the
boast
of
every
town
and
a
university
training
was
considered
as
essential
to
the
son
of
a
planter
as
to
the
heir
of
an
english
squire
a
true
aristocracy
in
habit
and
in
lineage
the
gentlemen
of
virginia
long
swayed
the
councils
of
the
nation
and
among
them
were
many
who
were
intimate
with
the
best
representatives
of
european
culture
beyond
the
alleghanies
there
were
no
facilities
for
education
and
even
had
opportunities
offered
few
would
have
had
the
leisure
to
enjoy
them
labour
was
scarce
either
slave
or
hired
the
owners
of
farms
were
their
own
managers
and
overseers
and
young
men
had
to
serve
a
practical
apprenticeship
to
lumbering
and
agriculture
to
this
rule
despite
his
wealth
jackson
was
no
exception
he
had
to
fight
his
own
battle
to
rub
shoulders
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
to
hold
his
own
as
best
he
could
it
was
a
hard
school
then
in
which
he
grew
to
manhood
but
for
that
very
reason
it
was
a
good
school
for
the
future
soldier
for
a
man
who
has
to
push
his
own
way
in
the
world
more
especially
if
he
has
to
carve
it
with
his
sword
a
boyhood
passed
amidst
surroundings
which
boast
of
no
luxury
and
demand
much
endurance
is
the
best
probation
von
moltke
has
recorded
that
the
comfortless
routine
of
the
military
academy
at
copenhagen
inured
him
to
privation
and
jackson
learned
the
great
lesson
of
in
the
rough
life
of
his
uncle
homestead
the
story
of
his
early
years
is
soon
told
as
a
child
with
long
fair
hair
he
was
curiously
thoughtful
and
exceedingly
affectionate
his
temper
was
generous
and
cheerful
his
truthfulness
was
proverbial
and
his
little
sister
found
in
him
the
kindest
of
playmates
and
the
sturdiest
of
protectors
he
was
distinguished
too
for
his
politeness
although
good
manners
were
by
no
means
rare
in
the
rustic
west
the
manly
courtesy
of
the
true
american
is
no
exotic
product
nor
is
the
universal
deference
to
woman
peculiar
to
any
single
class
the
farmer
of
the
backwoods
might
be
ignorant
of
the
conventionalities
but
the
simplicity
and
unselfishness
which
are
the
root
of
all
good
breeding
could
be
learned
in
west
virginia
as
readily
as
in
richmond
once
tempted
by
his
brother
the
boy
left
his
adopted
home
and
the
two
children
for
the
elder
was
no
more
than
twelve
wandered
down
the
ohio
to
the
mississippi
and
spent
the
summer
on
a
lonely
and
malarious
island
cutting
wood
for
passing
steamers
no
one
opposed
their
going
and
it
seems
to
have
been
considered
quite
natural
in
that
independent
community
that
the
veriest
urchins
should
be
allowed
to
seek
their
fortunes
for
themselves
returning
ragged
and
the
little
adventurers
submitted
once
more
to
the
routine
of
the
farm
and
to
the
intermittent
studies
of
a
country
school
after
his
failure
as
a
man
of
business
our
small
hero
showed
no
further
inclination
to
seek
his
fortunes
far
afield
he
was
fond
of
his
home
his
uncle
attracted
by
his
steadiness
and
good
sense
treated
him
more
as
a
companion
than
a
child
and
in
everything
connected
with
the
farm
as
well
as
in
the
sports
of
the
country
side
the
boy
took
the
keenest
interest
delicate
by
nature
with
a
tendency
to
consumption
inherited
from
his
mother
his
physique
and
constitution
benefited
by
a
life
of
constant
exercise
and
wholesome
toil
at
school
he
was
a
leader
in
every
game
and
his
proficiency
in
the
saddle
proved
him
a
true
virginian
and
were
popular
amusements
and
his
uncle
not
only
kept
a
stable
of
horses
but
had
a
on
his
own
grounds
as
a
jockey
the
future
general
was
a
useful
member
of
the
household
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
neighbourhood
that
if
a
horse
had
any
winning
qualities
whatever
in
him
young
jackson
never
failed
to
bring
them
out
in
the
management
of
the
estate
he
learned
early
to
put
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
transporting
timber
from
the
forest
to
the
was
one
of
his
most
frequent
tasks
and
tradition
records
that
if
a
tree
were
to
be
moved
from
ground
of
unusual
difficulty
or
if
there
were
one
more
gigantic
than
the
rest
the
party
of
labourers
was
put
under
his
control
and
the
work
was
sure
to
be
effected
one
who
knew
him
well
has
described
his
character
he
was
a
youth
of
exemplary
habits
of
indomitable
will
and
undoubted
courage
he
was
not
what
is
nowadays
termed
brilliant
but
he
was
one
of
those
untiring
persons
who
would
never
give
up
an
undertaking
until
he
accomplished
his
object
he
learned
slowly
but
what
he
got
into
his
head
he
never
forgot
he
was
not
quick
to
decide
except
when
excited
and
then
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
a
thing
he
did
it
on
short
notice
and
in
quick
time
once
while
on
his
way
to
school
an
overgrown
rustic
behaved
rudely
to
one
of
the
jackson
fired
up
and
told
him
he
must
apologise
at
once
or
he
would
thrash
him
the
big
fellow
supposing
that
he
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
refused
whereupon
jackson
pitched
into
him
and
gave
him
a
severe
pounding
his
surroundings
then
although
neither
refined
nor
elevating
were
not
unwholesome
but
of
the
moral
influences
to
which
he
was
subjected
so
much
can
not
be
said
while
the
stock
of
piety
that
the
original
settlers
brought
with
them
had
not
entirely
vanished
there
was
much
irregularity
of
life
few
men
gave
any
thought
to
religion
and
young
jackson
drifted
with
the
tide
yet
there
was
something
that
preserved
him
from
contamination
his
uncle
kindest
of
guardians
though
irreligious
and
a
sportsman
was
scrupulously
exacting
in
matters
of
integrity
and
veracity
his
associates
included
the
most
respectable
yet
the
morals
of
the
sporting
fraternity
of
a
frontier
settlement
are
not
likely
to
have
been
edifying
that
his
nephew
as
he
himself
declares
was
an
ardent
frequenter
of
races
anglice
and
country
dances
is
hardly
surprising
and
it
is
assuredly
no
ground
whatever
for
reproach
nor
is
it
strange
that
amid
much
laxity
he
should
have
retained
his
integrity
that
his
regard
for
truth
should
have
remained
untarnished
and
that
he
should
have
consistently
held
aloof
from
all
that
was
mean
and
vile
his
mother
was
no
mere
memory
to
that
affectionate
nature
his
good
qualities
however
would
scarcely
of
themselves
have
done
more
than
raise
him
to
a
respectable
rank
amongst
the
farmers
of
west
virginia
a
spur
was
wanting
to
urge
him
beyond
the
limits
of
so
contracted
an
existence
and
that
spur
was
supplied
by
an
honourable
ambition
penniless
and
dependent
as
he
was
he
still
remembered
that
his
ancestors
had
been
distinguished
beyond
the
confines
of
their
native
county
and
this
legitimate
pride
in
his
own
people
a
reflection
perhaps
of
the
traditional
scottish
attitude
towards
name
and
pedigree
exercised
a
marked
influence
on
his
whole
career
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
his
forefathers
was
the
purpose
of
his
early
manhood
it
gives
us
a
key
to
many
of
the
singularities
of
his
character
to
his
hunger
for
to
his
punctilious
observance
from
a
boy
of
the
essentials
of
gentlemanly
bearing
and
to
the
uniform
assertion
of
his
dabney
volume
page
it
was
his
openly
expressed
wish
for
larger
advantages
than
those
offered
by
a
country
school
that
brought
about
his
opportunity
in
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
became
a
constable
of
the
county
a
sort
of
minor
sheriff
he
had
to
execute
the
decrees
of
the
justices
to
serve
their
warrants
to
collect
small
debts
and
to
summon
witnesses
it
was
a
curious
office
for
a
boy
but
a
year
or
two
before
he
had
been
seized
with
some
obscure
form
of
dyspepsia
and
the
idea
that
a
life
on
horseback
which
his
duties
necessitated
might
restore
his
health
had
induced
his
relatives
to
obtain
the
post
for
him
jackson
himself
seems
to
have
been
influenced
by
the
hope
that
his
salary
would
help
towards
his
education
and
by
the
wish
to
become
independent
of
his
uncle
bounty
his
new
duties
were
uncongenial
but
despite
his
youth
he
faced
his
responsibilities
with
a
determination
which
men
of
maturer
years
might
well
have
envied
in
everything
he
was
scrupulously
exact
his
accounts
were
accurately
kept
he
was
punctuality
itself
and
his
patience
was
inexhaustible
for
two
years
he
submitted
cheerfully
to
the
drudgery
of
his
position
his
health
but
without
advancing
a
single
step
towards
the
goal
of
his
ambition
but
before
he
was
nineteen
his
hopes
were
unexpectedly
realised
the
military
academy
at
west
point
not
only
provided
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
a
sound
and
liberal
education
but
offered
an
opening
to
an
honourable
career
nominations
to
cadetships
were
made
by
the
secretary
of
war
on
the
recommendation
of
members
of
congress
and
in
a
vacancy
occurred
which
was
to
be
filled
by
a
youth
from
the
congressional
district
in
which
clarksburg
was
included
jackson
informed
of
the
chance
by
a
friendly
blacksmith
eagerly
embraced
it
and
left
no
stone
unturned
to
attain
his
object
every
possible
influence
that
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
member
for
the
district
was
immediately
enlisted
to
those
who
objected
that
his
education
was
too
imperfect
to
enable
him
even
to
enter
the
academy
he
replied
that
he
had
the
necessary
application
that
he
hoped
he
had
the
capacity
and
that
he
was
at
least
determined
to
try
his
earnestness
and
courage
won
upon
all
his
application
was
strongly
backed
by
those
who
had
learned
to
value
his
integrity
and
exactness
and
hays
the
member
for
the
district
wrote
that
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
secure
the
appointment
no
sooner
had
the
letter
been
read
than
jackson
determined
to
go
at
once
to
washington
in
order
that
he
might
be
ready
to
proceed
to
west
point
without
a
delay
packing
a
few
clothes
into
a
pair
of
saddlebags
he
mounted
his
horse
and
accompanied
by
a
servant
who
was
to
bring
the
animal
home
rode
off
to
catch
the
coach
at
clarksburg
it
had
already
passed
but
galloping
on
he
overtook
it
at
the
next
stage
and
on
his
arrival
at
washington
hays
at
once
introduced
him
to
the
secretary
of
war
on
presenting
him
he
explained
the
disadvantages
of
his
education
but
begged
indulgence
for
him
on
account
of
his
pluck
and
determination
the
secretary
plied
him
with
questions
but
jackson
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
purpose
and
so
good
was
the
impression
which
he
made
that
he
then
and
there
received
his
warrant
accompanied
by
some
excellent
advice
sir
said
the
secretary
you
have
a
good
name
go
to
west
point
and
the
first
man
who
insults
you
knock
him
down
and
have
it
charged
to
my
account
hays
proposed
that
the
cadet
should
stay
with
him
for
a
few
days
in
order
to
see
the
sights
of
washington
but
as
the
academy
was
already
in
session
jackson
with
a
strong
appreciation
of
the
value
of
time
begged
to
decline
he
was
content
to
ascend
to
the
roof
of
the
capitol
then
still
building
and
look
once
on
the
magnificent
panorama
of
which
it
is
the
centre
at
his
feet
lay
the
city
with
its
busy
streets
and
imposing
edifices
to
the
south
ran
the
potomac
bearing
on
its
ample
tide
the
snowy
sails
of
many
merchantmen
and
spanned
by
a
bridge
more
than
a
mile
in
length
over
against
the
capitol
looking
down
on
that
shore
stood
the
white
porch
of
arlington
once
the
property
of
washington
and
now
the
home
of
a
young
officer
of
the
united
states
army
robert
edward
lee
beyond
arlington
lay
virginia
jackson
native
state
stretching
back
in
leafy
hills
and
verdant
pastures
and
far
and
low
upon
the
western
horizon
his
own
mountains
loomed
faintly
through
the
summer
haze
it
was
a
strange
freak
of
fortune
that
placed
him
at
the
very
outset
of
his
career
within
sight
of
the
theatre
of
his
most
famous
victories
it
was
a
still
stranger
caprice
that
was
to
make
the
name
of
the
simple
country
youth
and
penniless
as
terrible
in
washington
as
the
name
of
the
black
douglas
was
once
in
durham
and
carlisle
it
was
in
july
that
one
of
america
greatest
soldiers
first
answered
to
his
name
on
the
at
west
point
shy
and
silent
clad
in
virginia
homespun
with
the
whole
of
his
personal
effects
carried
in
a
pair
of
saddle
bags
the
impression
that
he
made
on
his
future
comrades
as
the
secretary
of
war
appears
to
have
anticipated
was
by
no
means
favourable
the
west
point
cadets
were
then
as
now
remarkable
for
their
upright
carriage
the
neatness
of
their
appointments
and
their
soldierly
bearing
towards
their
officers
and
towards
each
other
the
grey
coatee
decorated
with
bright
buttons
and
broad
gold
lace
the
shako
with
tall
plumes
the
spotless
white
trousers
set
off
the
trim
young
figures
to
the
best
advantage
and
the
parade
of
the
cadet
battalion
marked
by
discipline
and
precision
in
every
movement
is
still
one
of
the
most
attractive
of
military
spectacles
these
natty
young
gentlemen
were
not
slow
to
detect
the
superficial
deficiencies
of
the
newcomer
a
system
of
practical
joking
carried
to
extremes
had
long
been
a
feature
of
west
point
life
jackson
with
the
rusticity
of
the
backwoods
apparent
at
every
turn
promised
the
highest
sport
and
here
it
may
be
written
once
for
all
that
however
nearly
in
point
of
character
the
intended
victim
reached
the
heroic
standard
his
outward
graces
were
few
his
features
were
well
cut
his
forehead
high
his
mouth
small
and
firm
and
his
complexion
fresh
yet
the
ensemble
was
not
striking
nor
was
it
redeemed
by
grave
eyes
and
a
heavy
jaw
a
strong
but
angular
frame
a
certain
awkwardness
of
movement
and
large
hands
and
feet
his
tormentors
however
soon
found
they
had
mistaken
their
man
the
homespun
jacket
covered
a
natural
shrewdness
which
had
been
sharpened
by
responsibility
the
readiness
of
resource
which
had
characterised
the
whilom
constable
was
more
than
a
match
for
their
most
ingenious
schemes
and
baffled
by
a
temper
which
they
were
powerless
to
disturb
their
attempts
at
persecution
apparently
more
productive
of
amusement
to
their
victim
than
to
themselves
were
soon
abandoned
rough
as
was
the
life
of
the
virginia
border
it
had
done
something
to
fit
this
unpromising
recruit
for
the
give
and
take
of
his
new
existence
culture
might
be
lacking
in
the
distant
west
but
the
air
men
breathed
was
at
least
the
blessed
breath
of
independence
each
was
what
he
made
himself
a
man
standing
depended
on
his
success
in
life
and
success
was
within
the
reach
of
all
there
like
his
neighbours
jackson
had
learned
to
take
his
own
part
like
them
he
acknowledged
no
superiority
save
that
of
actual
merit
and
believing
that
the
richest
prize
might
be
won
by
energy
and
perseverance
without
diffidence
or
misgiving
he
faced
his
future
he
knew
nothing
of
the
life
of
the
great
nation
of
which
he
was
so
insignificant
an
atom
of
the
duties
of
the
army
of
the
manners
of
its
officers
he
knew
only
that
even
as
regards
education
he
had
an
uphill
task
before
him
he
was
indeed
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
world
with
his
own
way
to
make
and
apparently
no
single
advantage
in
his
favour
but
he
came
of
a
fighting
race
he
had
his
own
inflexible
resolution
to
support
him
and
his
determination
expressed
itself
in
his
very
bearing
four
cadets
three
of
whom
were
afterwards
confederate
generals
hill
pickett
and
maury
were
standing
together
when
he
first
entered
the
gates
of
the
academy
there
was
about
him
says
one
of
them
so
sturdy
an
expression
of
purpose
that
i
remarked
that
fellow
looks
as
if
he
had
come
to
stay
jackson
educational
deficiencies
were
more
difficult
of
conquest
than
the
goodwill
of
his
comrades
his
want
of
previous
training
placed
him
at
a
great
disadvantage
he
commenced
his
career
amongst
the
immortals
the
last
section
of
the
class
and
it
was
only
by
the
most
strenuous
efforts
that
he
maintained
his
place
his
struggles
at
the
blackboard
were
often
painful
to
witness
in
the
struggle
to
solve
a
problem
he
invariably
covered
both
his
face
and
uniform
with
chalk
and
he
perspired
so
freely
even
in
the
coldest
weather
that
the
cadets
with
boyish
exaggeration
declared
that
whenever
the
general
as
he
had
at
once
been
dubbed
in
honour
of
his
namesake
the
victor
of
new
orleans
got
a
difficult
proposition
he
was
certain
to
flood
the
classroom
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
pass
his
first
examination
communicated
by
general
john
gibbon
we
were
studying
writes
a
classmate
algebra
and
analytical
geometry
that
winter
and
jackson
was
very
low
in
his
class
just
before
the
signal
lights
out
he
would
pile
up
his
grate
with
anthracite
coal
and
lying
prone
before
it
on
the
floor
would
work
away
at
his
lessons
by
the
glare
of
the
fire
which
scorched
his
very
brain
till
a
late
hour
of
the
night
this
evident
determination
to
succeed
not
only
aided
his
own
efforts
directly
but
impressed
his
instructors
in
his
favour
if
he
could
not
master
the
portion
of
the
assigned
for
the
day
he
would
not
pass
it
over
but
continued
to
work
at
it
till
he
understood
it
thus
it
often
happened
that
when
he
was
called
out
to
repeat
his
task
he
had
to
reply
that
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
lesson
of
the
day
but
was
employed
upon
the
previous
one
there
was
then
no
alternative
but
to
mark
him
as
unprepared
a
proceeding
which
did
not
in
the
least
affect
his
resolution
despite
all
drawbacks
his
four
years
at
the
academy
were
years
of
steady
progress
the
immortals
were
soon
left
far
behind
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelve
months
he
stood
in
a
class
of
but
when
he
entered
the
first
class
and
commenced
the
study
of
logic
that
bugbear
to
the
majority
he
shot
from
near
the
foot
of
the
class
to
the
top
in
the
final
examination
he
came
out
seventeenth
notwithstanding
that
the
less
successful
years
were
taken
into
account
and
it
was
a
frequent
remark
amongst
his
brother
cadets
that
if
the
course
had
been
a
year
longer
he
would
have
come
out
first
his
own
satisfaction
was
complete
not
only
was
his
perseverance
rewarded
by
a
place
sufficiently
high
to
give
him
a
commission
in
the
artillery
but
his
cravings
for
knowledge
had
been
fully
gratified
west
point
was
much
more
than
a
military
school
it
was
a
university
and
a
university
under
the
very
strictest
discipline
where
the
science
of
the
soldier
formed
only
a
portion
of
the
course
subjects
which
are
now
considered
essential
to
a
military
education
were
not
taught
at
all
the
art
of
war
gave
place
to
ethics
and
engineering
and
mathematics
and
chemistry
were
considered
of
far
more
importance
than
topography
and
fortification
yet
with
french
history
and
drawing
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
course
was
sufficiently
comprehensive
no
cadet
was
permitted
to
graduate
unless
he
had
reached
a
high
standard
of
proficiency
failures
were
numerous
in
the
four
years
the
classes
grew
gradually
smaller
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
was
a
principle
of
administration
which
was
rigidly
observed
the
fact
then
that
a
man
had
passed
the
final
examination
at
west
point
was
a
sufficient
certificate
that
he
had
received
a
thorough
education
that
his
mental
faculties
had
been
strengthened
by
four
years
of
hard
work
and
that
he
was
well
equipped
to
take
his
place
amongst
his
fellow
men
and
it
was
more
than
this
four
years
of
the
strictest
discipline
for
the
cadets
were
allowed
only
one
vacation
during
their
whole
course
were
sufficient
to
break
in
even
the
most
careless
and
the
most
slovenly
to
neatness
obedience
and
punctuality
such
habits
are
not
easily
unlearned
and
the
west
point
certificate
was
thus
a
guarantee
of
qualities
that
are
everywhere
useful
it
did
not
necessarily
follow
that
because
a
cadet
won
a
commission
he
remained
a
soldier
many
went
to
civil
life
and
the
academy
was
an
excellent
school
for
men
who
intended
to
find
a
career
as
surveyors
or
engineers
the
great
railway
system
of
the
united
states
was
then
in
its
infancy
its
development
offered
endless
possibilities
and
the
work
of
extending
civilisation
in
a
vast
and
rapidly
improving
country
had
perhaps
more
attraction
for
the
ambitious
than
the
career
of
arms
the
training
and
discipline
of
west
point
were
not
then
concentrated
in
one
profession
but
were
disseminated
throughout
the
states
and
it
was
with
this
purpose
that
the
institution
of
the
academy
had
been
approved
by
congress
in
the
wars
with
england
the
militia
of
the
different
states
had
furnished
the
means
both
of
resistance
and
aggression
but
their
grave
shortcomings
owing
principally
to
the
lack
of
competent
officers
had
been
painfully
conspicuous
after
the
principle
that
the
militia
was
the
first
line
of
defence
was
still
adhered
to
and
the
standing
army
was
merely
maintained
as
a
school
for
generals
and
a
frontier
guard
it
was
expected
however
that
in
case
of
war
the
west
point
graduates
would
supply
the
national
forces
with
a
large
number
of
officers
who
despite
their
civil
avocations
would
at
least
be
familiar
with
drill
and
discipline
this
fact
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
view
of
the
civil
war
the
demands
of
the
enormous
armies
then
put
into
the
field
were
utterly
unprecedented
and
the
supply
of
west
pointers
was
altogether
inadequate
to
meet
them
but
the
influence
of
the
military
academy
was
conspicuous
throughout
not
a
few
of
the
most
able
generals
were
little
more
than
boys
and
yet
as
a
rule
they
were
far
superior
to
those
who
came
from
the
militia
or
volunteers
four
years
of
strict
routine
of
constant
drill
and
implicit
subordination
at
the
most
impressionable
period
of
life
proved
a
far
better
training
for
command
than
the
desultory
and
intermittent
service
of
a
citizen
army
during
his
stay
at
west
point
jackson
development
was
not
all
in
one
direction
he
gained
in
health
and
strength
when
he
joined
he
had
not
yet
attained
his
full
height
which
fell
short
of
six
feet
by
two
inches
the
constant
drilling
developed
his
frame
he
grew
rapidly
and
soon
acquired
the
erect
bearing
of
the
soldier
but
notwithstanding
the
incessant
practice
in
riding
fencing
and
marching
his
anatomical
peculiarities
still
asserted
themselves
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
he
mastered
the
elementary
process
of
keeping
step
and
despite
his
youthful
proficiency
as
a
jockey
the
regulation
seat
of
the
dragoon
to
be
acquired
on
the
back
of
a
rough
cavalry
trooper
was
an
accomplishment
which
he
never
mastered
if
it
be
added
that
his
shyness
never
thawed
that
he
was
habitually
silent
it
is
hardly
surprising
to
find
that
he
had
few
intimates
at
the
academy
caring
nothing
for
the
opinion
of
others
and
tolerant
of
association
rather
than
seeking
it
his
nature
asked
neither
sympathy
nor
affection
his
studious
habits
never
left
him
his
only
recreation
was
a
rapid
walk
in
the
intervals
of
the
classes
his
whole
thoughts
and
his
whole
energy
were
centred
on
doing
his
duty
and
passing
into
the
army
with
all
the
credit
he
could
possibly
attain
although
he
was
thoroughly
happy
at
west
point
life
to
him
even
at
that
early
age
was
a
serious
business
and
most
seriously
he
set
about
it
still
unsociable
and
irresponsive
as
he
was
there
were
those
in
whose
company
he
found
pleasure
cadets
who
had
studied
subjects
not
included
in
the
west
point
course
and
from
whom
there
was
something
to
be
learned
it
was
an
unwritten
law
of
the
academy
that
those
of
the
senior
year
should
not
make
companions
of
their
juniors
but
jackson
paid
no
heed
to
the
traditionary
code
of
etiquette
his
acquaintances
were
chosen
regardless
of
standing
as
often
from
the
class
below
him
as
his
own
and
in
yet
another
fashion
his
strength
of
character
was
displayed
towards
those
who
were
guilty
of
dishonourable
conduct
he
was
merciless
almost
to
vindictiveness
he
had
his
own
code
of
right
and
wrong
and
from
one
who
infringed
it
he
would
accept
neither
apology
nor
excuse
his
musket
which
was
always
scrupulously
clean
was
one
day
replaced
by
another
in
most
slovenly
order
he
called
the
attention
of
his
captain
to
his
loss
and
described
the
private
mark
by
which
it
was
to
be
identified
that
evening
at
the
inspection
of
arms
it
was
found
in
the
hands
of
another
cadet
who
when
taxed
with
his
offence
endeavoured
to
shield
himself
by
falsehood
jackson
anger
was
unbounded
and
for
the
moment
his
habitual
shyness
completely
disappeared
he
declared
that
such
a
creature
should
not
continue
a
member
of
the
academy
and
demanded
that
he
should
be
tried
by
and
expelled
it
was
only
by
means
of
the
most
persevering
remonstrances
on
the
part
of
his
comrades
and
his
officers
that
he
could
be
induced
to
waive
his
right
of
pressing
the
charge
his
regard
for
duty
too
was
no
less
marked
than
his
respect
for
truth
during
one
his
was
of
his
company
and
this
if
perfunctory
young
gentleman
often
told
jackson
that
he
need
not
attend
the
reveille
at
which
every
cadet
was
supposed
to
answer
to
his
name
not
once
however
did
he
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
communicated
by
colonel
turnley
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
altogether
so
uncompromising
as
at
first
sight
he
appeared
at
west
point
as
in
after
years
those
who
saw
him
interested
or
excited
noticed
that
his
smile
was
singularly
sweet
and
the
cadets
knew
that
it
revealed
a
warm
heart
within
whenever
from
sickness
or
misfortune
a
comrade
stood
in
need
of
sympathy
jackson
was
the
first
to
offer
it
and
he
would
devote
himself
to
his
help
with
a
tenderness
so
womanly
that
it
sometimes
excited
ridicule
sensitive
he
was
not
for
of
vanity
he
had
not
the
slightest
taint
but
of
tact
and
sensibility
he
possessed
more
than
his
share
if
he
was
careless
of
what
others
thought
of
him
he
thought
much
of
them
though
no
one
made
more
light
of
pain
on
his
own
account
no
one
could
have
more
carefully
avoided
giving
pain
to
others
except
when
duty
demanded
it
and
one
of
his
colonel
turnley
testifies
that
he
went
through
the
trying
ordeal
of
four
years
at
west
point
without
ever
having
a
hard
word
or
bad
feeling
from
cadet
or
professor
nor
did
his
comrades
fail
to
remember
that
when
he
was
unjustly
blamed
he
chose
to
bear
the
imputation
silently
rather
than
expose
those
who
were
really
at
fault
and
so
even
in
that
lighthearted
battalion
his
sterling
worth
compelled
respect
all
honoured
his
efforts
and
wished
him
while
there
were
many
says
colonel
turnley
who
seemed
to
surpass
him
in
intellect
in
geniality
and
in
there
was
no
one
of
our
class
who
more
absolutely
possessed
the
respect
and
confidence
of
all
and
in
the
end
old
jack
as
he
was
always
called
with
his
desperate
earnestness
his
unflinching
straightforwardness
and
his
high
sense
of
honour
came
to
be
regarded
by
his
comrades
with
something
very
like
affection
one
peculiarity
can
not
be
passed
by
when
at
study
he
always
sat
bolt
upright
at
his
table
with
his
book
open
before
him
and
when
he
was
not
using
pencil
and
paper
to
solve
a
problem
he
would
often
keep
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wall
or
ceiling
in
the
most
profound
abstraction
no
one
i
have
ever
known
says
a
cadet
who
shared
his
could
so
perfectly
withdraw
his
mind
from
surrounding
objects
or
influences
and
so
thoroughly
involve
his
whole
being
in
the
subject
under
consideration
his
lessons
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
to
thoroughly
understand
them
was
always
his
determined
effort
to
make
the
author
knowledge
his
own
was
ever
the
point
at
which
he
aimed
this
intense
application
of
mind
was
naturally
strengthened
by
constant
exercise
and
month
by
month
and
year
by
year
his
faculties
of
perception
developed
rapidly
until
he
grasped
with
unerring
quickness
the
inceptive
points
of
all
ethical
and
mathematical
problems
this
power
of
abstraction
and
of
application
is
well
worth
noting
for
not
only
was
it
remarkable
in
a
boy
but
as
we
shall
see
hereafter
it
had
much
to
do
with
the
making
of
the
soldier
at
west
point
jackson
was
troubled
with
the
return
of
the
obscure
complaint
which
had
already
threatened
him
and
he
there
began
that
rigid
observance
of
the
laws
of
health
which
afterwards
developed
to
almost
an
eccentricity
his
peculiar
attitude
when
studying
was
due
to
the
fear
that
if
he
bent
over
his
work
the
compression
of
his
internal
organs
might
increase
their
tendency
to
disease
and
not
only
did
he
lay
down
rules
for
his
physical
regimen
a
book
of
maxims
which
he
drew
up
at
west
point
has
been
preserved
and
we
learn
that
his
scrupulous
exactness
his
punctilious
courtesy
and
his
choice
of
companions
were
the
outcome
of
much
deliberation
nothing
in
this
curious
volume
occurs
to
show
that
his
thoughts
had
yet
been
turned
to
religion
it
is
as
free
from
all
reference
to
the
teachings
of
christianity
as
the
maxims
of
marcus
aurelius
every
line
there
written
shows
that
at
this
period
of
jackson
life
devotion
to
duty
was
his
guiding
rule
and
notwithstanding
his
remarkable
freedom
from
egotism
the
traces
of
an
engrossing
ambition
and
of
absolute
are
everywhere
apparent
many
of
the
sentiments
he
would
have
repudiated
in
as
inconsistent
with
humility
but
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
a
strong
and
fearless
hand
that
penned
on
a
conspicuous
page
the
sentence
you
can
be
what
you
resolve
to
be
jackson
was
already
a
man
in
years
when
he
passed
his
final
examination
and
here
the
record
of
his
boyhood
may
fitly
close
he
had
made
no
particular
mark
at
the
academy
his
memory
in
the
minds
of
his
comrades
was
associated
with
his
gravity
his
silence
his
kind
heart
and
his
awkward
movements
no
one
suspected
him
of
nobler
qualities
than
dogged
perseverance
and
a
strict
regard
for
truth
the
officers
and
sergeants
of
the
cadet
battalion
were
supplied
by
the
cadets
themselves
but
jackson
was
never
promoted
in
the
mimic
warfare
of
the
playground
at
brienne
napoleon
was
master
of
the
revels
his
capacity
for
command
had
already
been
detected
but
neither
comrade
nor
teacher
saw
beneath
the
unpromising
exterior
of
the
west
point
student
a
trace
of
aught
save
what
was
commonplace
and
yet
there
is
much
in
the
boyhood
of
stonewall
jackson
that

the
boyhood
of

of
all
great
soldiers
the
most
original
both

napoleon
lived
on
bread

that
he
might
educate
his

jackson
saved
his

to
give
his

both
were
indefatigable
students
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
the
world
was
to
be
conquered
by
force
of

jackson
burning
his
lessons
into
his
brain
is
but
the
counterpart
of
the
young
officer
who
lodged
with
a
professor
of
mathematics
that
he
might
attend
his
classes
and
who
would
wait
to
explain
the
lectures
to
those
who
had
not
clearly
understood

both
were

neither
was

first
appearance
in

with
the
nickname
of
le

botte
it
is
hard
to
say
which
was
the
more
laughable
the
spare
and
bony
figure
of
the

sitting
bolt
upright
like
a
graven
image
in
a
tight
uniform
with
his
eyes
glued
to
the

the

with
gaunt

round

and
uncombed
hair
who
wandered
alone
about
the

in

had
the

of

the

of

not

scrupulously
kept
than
the

of

nor
could
they
show
a
greater
regard
for
economy
than
the

still
extant
on
which
the
future
emperor
gained
a
reduction
of
four
sous
but
it
was
not
on
such
trivial
lines
alone
that
they
run
parallel
an
inflexibility
of
purpose
an
absolute
disregard
of
popular
opinion
and
an
unswerving
belief
in
their
own
capacity
were
predominant
in
both
they
could
say
no
neither
sought
sympathy
and
both
felt
that
they
were
masters
of
their
own
fate

presently
what
should
i
do
there
now
but
here
the
parallel
ends
in
jackson
even
as
a
cadet
self
was
subordinate
to
duty
pride
was
foreign
to
his
nature
he
was
incapable
of
pretence
and
his
simplicity
was
inspired
by
that
disdain
of
all
meanness
which
had
been
his
characteristic
from
a
child
his
brain
was
disturbed
by
no
wild
visions
no
intemperate
ambition
confused
his
sense
of
right
and
wrong
the
essence
of
his
mind
as
has
been
said
of
another
of
like
mould
was
clearness
healthy
purity
incompatibility
with
fraud
in
any
of
its
forms
it
was
his
instinct
to
be
true
and
straightforward
as
it
was
to
be
false
and
subtle
and
if
as
a
youth
he
showed
no
trace
of
marked
intellectual
power
if
his
instructors
saw
no
sign
of
masterful
resolution
and
a
genius
for
command
it
was
because
at
west
point
as
elsewhere
his
great
qualities
lay
dormant
awaiting
the
emergency
that
should
call
them
forth
chapter

jackson
received
the
brevet
rank
of

lieutenant
of

he
was
fortunate
from
the
very
outset
of
his
military
career
the
officers
of
the
united

army
thanks
to
the
thorough
education
and
spartan
discipline
of
west

were
fine
soldiers
but
their
scope
was
limited
on
the
western
frontier
far
beyond
the
confines
of
civilisation
stood
a
long
line
of
forts
often
hundreds
of
miles
apart
garrisoned
by
a
few
troops
of
cavalry
or
companies
of
infantry
it
is
true
that
there
was
little
chance
of
soldierly
capacity
rusting
in
these
solitary
posts
from
the
borders
of
canada
to
the
banks
of
the
rio
grande
swarmed
thousands
of
savage
warriors
ever
watchful
for
an
opportunity
to
pay
back
with
bloody
interest
the
aggression
of
the
whites
murder
robbery
and
massacre
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
and
the
troops
were
allowed
few
intervals
of
rest
but
the
warfare
was
inglorious
a
mere
series
of
petty
incidents
the
punishment
of
a
raid
or
the
crushing
of
an
isolated
revolt
the
scanty
butcher
bills
of
the
battles
made
small
appeal
to
the
popular
imagination
and
the
deeds
of
the
soldiers
in
the
western
wilderness

as
they
might

the

of
a
great
campaign
in
the
running
fights
against

or
blackfoot
the
rules
of
strategy
and
tactics
were
of
small
account
the
soldier
was
constrained
to
acknowledge
the
brave
and
the
trapper
as
his
teachers
and

himself
with
all
his

would
have
been
utterly
baffled
by
the
cunning
of

not

than

and
the
whole
of

with
the

of
a

scattered
in
small
detachments
along

the

were
never

together
in

bodies
and
although
they
were
well
drilled
and
under
the
strictest
discipline
neither
the
commanders
nor
the

had
the

experience
of
handling

an
enterprise

disembark
an

possesses
the
advantage
that

on

a

in

the

grudged

have
cost

hostile
coast
has
to
endure
a
certain
period
of
inactivity
under
ordinary
circumstances
as
at
vera
cruz
the
process
of
disembarking
men
is
rapidly
accomplished
the
follow
with
but
little
delay
and
a
certain
proportion
of
cavalry
becomes
early
available
but
the
disembarkation
of
the
impedimenta
the
stores
waggons
hospitals
ammunition
and
transport
animals
even
where
ample
facilities
exist
demands
far
more
time
than
the
disembarkation
of
the
fighting
force
in
the
present
case
as
all
the
animals
had
to
be
requisitioned
in
the
country
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
april
that
supplies
and
transport
sufficient
to
warrant
further
movement
had
been
accumulated
and
meanwhile
general
santa
anna
halting
in
the
mountains
had
occupied
the
pass
of
cerro
gordo
with
men
and
pieces
of
artillery
the
mexican
position
was
exceedingly
strong
the
right
rested
on
a
deep
ravine
with
precipitous
cliffs
the
left
on
the
hill
of
cerro
gordo
covered
with
batteries
and
towering
to
the
height
of
several
hundred
feet
above
the
surrounding
ridges
while
the
front
strongly
intrenched
and
commanding
the
road
which
wound
zigzag
fashion
up
the
steep
ascent
followed
the
crest
of
a
lofty
ridge
the
americans
reached
the
foot
of
the
pass
without
difficulty
the
enemy
had
made
no
attempt
to
check
their
passage
through
the
forest
confident
in
the
inaccessibility
of
his
mountain
crags
in
his
numerous
guns
and
massive
breastworks
santa
anna
reserved
his
strength
for
battle
on
ground
of
his
own
selection
several
days
were
consumed
in
reconnaissance
the
engineers
to
whom
this
duty
was
generally
assigned
in
the
american
army
pushed
their
explorations
to
either
flank
at
length
the
quick
eye
of
a
young
officer
captain
robert
lee
already
noted
for
his
services
at
vera
cruz
discovered
a
line
of
approach
hidden
from
the
enemy
by
which
the
position
might
be
turned
in
three
days
a
rough
road
was
constructed
by
which
guns
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
hill
of
cerro
gordo
and
infantry
marched
round
to
strike
the
mexicans
in
rear
april
the
attack
delivered
at
daylight
on
april
was
brilliantly
successful
the
enemy
was
completely
surprised
cerro
gordo
was
stormed
with
the
bayonet
and
santa
anna
right
assaulted
from
a
direction
whence
he
confessed
that
he
had
not
believed
a
goat
could
approach
his
lines
was
rolled
back
in
confusion
on
his
centre
mexicans
were
killed
and
wounded
and
captured
together
with
the
whole
of
their
artillery
the
americans
had
about
men
upon
the
field
and
their
loss
was
including
two
generals
memoirs
of
scott
the
next
day
the
pursuit
was
pushed
with
uncompromising
resolution
amidst
pathless
mountains
feet
above
the
sea
where
every
spur
formed
a
strong
position
the
defeated
army
was
permitted
neither
halt
nor
respite
the
american
dragoons
undeterred
by
numbers
pressed
forward
along
the
road
making
hundreds
of
prisoners
and
spreading
panic
in
the
broken
ranks
may
the
infantry
followed
sturdily
breasting
the
long
ascent
a
second
intrenched
position
barring
the
la
hoya
pass
was
abandoned
on
their
approach
the
strong
castle
of
perote
with
an
armament
of
guns
and
mortars
opened
its
gates
without
firing
a
shot
and
on
may
the
great
city
of
puebla
surrounded
by
glens
of
astonishing
fertility
and
only
eighty
miles
from
mexico
was
occupied
without
resistance
at
cerro
gordo
the
first
artillery
were
employed
as
infantry
their
colours
were
amongst
the
first
to
be
planted
on
the
breastworks
but
in
none
of
the
reports
does
jackson
name
occur
according
to
the
regimental
records
his
company
k
was
not
engaged
in
the
battle
but
only
in
the
pursuit
the
battle
however
brought
him
good
luck
captain
magruder
an
officer
of
his
own
regiment
who
was
to
win
distinction
on
wider
fields
had
captured
a
mexican
field
battery
which
scott
presented
to
him
as
a
reward
for
his
gallantry
indian
wars
had
done
but
little
towards
teaching
american
soldiers
the
true
use
of
artillery
against
a
rapidly
moving
enemy
who
systematically
forebore
exposing
himself
in
mass
and
in
a
country
where
no
roads
existed
only
the
was
effective
but
already
at
palo
alto
and
resaca
against
the
serried
lines
and
thronging
cavalry
of
the
mexicans
light
had
done
extraordinary
execution
the
heavy
artillery
hitherto
the
more
favoured
service
saw
itself
eclipsed
the
first
regiment
however
had
already
been
prominent
on
the
fighting
line
it
had
won
reputation
with
the
bayonet
at
cerro
gordo
and
before
mexico
was
reached
there
were
other
battles
to
be
fought
and
other
positions
to
be
stormed
a
youth
with
a
predilection
for
hard
knocks
might
have
been
content
with
the
chances
offered
to
the
but
jackson
partiality
for
his
own
arm
was
as
marked
as
was
napoleon
and
the
decisive
effect
of
a
battery
appealed
to
his
instincts
with
greater
force
than
the
wild
rush
of
a
charge
of
infantry
skilful
manoeuvring
was
more
to
his
taste
than
the
mere
bludgeon
work
of
fighting
at
close
quarters
two
subalterns
were
required
for
the
new
battery
the
position
meant
much
hard
work
and
possibly
much
discomfort
magruder
was
restless
and
and
the
young
officers
of
artillery
showed
no
eagerness
to
go
through
the
campaign
as
his
subordinates
not
so
jackson
he
foresaw
that
service
with
a
light
battery
under
a
bold
and
energetic
leader
was
likely
to
present
peculiar
opportunities
and
with
his
thorough
devotion
to
duty
his
habits
of
industry
and
his
strong
sense
of
he
had
little
fear
of
disappointing
the
expectations
of
the
most
exacting
superior
i
wanted
to
see
active
service
he
said
in
after
years
to
be
near
the
enemy
in
the
fight
and
when
i
heard
that
john
magruder
had
got
his
battery
i
bent
all
my
energies
to
be
with
him
for
i
knew
if
any
fighting
was
to
be
done
magruder
would
be
on
hand
his
soldierly
ambition
won
its
due
reward
the
favours
of
fortune
fall
to
the
men
who
woo
more
often
than
to
those
who
wait
the
proverb
which
declares
that
follows
the
volunteer
must
assuredly
have
germinated
in
a
commonplace
brain
it
is
characteristic
of
men
who
have
cut
their
way
to
fame
that
they
have
never
allowed
the
opportunity
to
escape
them
the
successful
man
pushes
to
the
front
and
seeks
his
chance
those
of
a
temper
less
ardent
wait
till
duty
calls
and
the
call
may
never
come
once
before
when
despite
his
manifold
disadvantages
he
secured
his
nomination
to
west
point
jackson
had
shown
how
readily
he
recognised
an
opening
now
when
his
comrades
held
back
he
eagerly
stepped
forward
to
prove
anew
the
truth
of
the
vigorous
adage
providence
helps
those
who
help
themselves
the
american
army
was
delayed
long
at
puebla
several
regiments
of
volunteers
who
had
engaged
only
for
a
short
term
of
service
demanded
their
discharge
and
reinforcements
were
slow
in
arriving
august
it
was
not
until
the
first
week
in
august
that
scott
was
able
to
move
upon
the
capital
the
army
now
numbered
men
several
hundred
were
sick
in
hospital
and
convalescents
together
with
effectives
were
left
to

the

in

up
a
total
of
officers
and
men
during
the
three
months
that
his
enemy
was
idle
at
puebla
santa
anna
had
reorganised
his
army
and

including
a
formidable
body
of
cavalry
fine
horsemen
and
well
trained
it
is
said
however
that
their

were
little
more
than

and
far
too
light
for

semmes
campaign
of
general
scott
and
a
large
number
of
heavy
batteries
were
now
ready
to
oppose
the
advance
of
the
invaders
on
august
the
american
army
crossed
the
rio
frio
mountains
feet
above
the
sea
the
highest
point
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
and
as
the
troops
descended
the
western
slopes
the
valley
of
mexico
first
broke
upon
their
view
there
beneath
the
shadow
of
her
mighty
mountains
capped
with
eternal
snows
stood
the
imperial
city
her
far
circling
walls
her
garden
groves
and
stately
palaces
there
lay
the
broad
plain
of
tenochtitlan
with
all
its
wealth
of
light
and
colour
the
verdure
of
the
forest
the
warmer
hues
of
the
great
ripening
to
the
harvest
and
the
sheen
and
sparkle
of
the
distant
lakes
there
it
lay
as
it
burst
upon
the
vision
of
cortez
and
his
companions
bathed
in
the
golden
sunshine
stretched
out
as
it
were
in
slumber
in
the
arms
of
the
giant
hills
on
every
hand
were
the
signs
of
a
teeming
population
white
villages
and
substantial
haciendas
glistened
in
the
woodlands
roads
broad
and
crossed
the
level
and
in
the
clear
atmosphere
of
those
lofty
altitudes
the
vast
size
of
the
city
was
plainly
visible
the
whole
army
of
mexico
formed
the
garrison
hills
crowned
with
batteries
commanded
the
approaches
while
a
network
of
canals
on
either
flank
and
a
broad
area
of
deep
water
enhanced
the
difficulties
of
manoeuvre
the
line
of
communication
far
too
long
to
be
maintained
by
the
small
force
at
scott
disposal
had
already
been
abandoned
the
army
depended
for
subsistence
on
what
it
could
purchase
in
the
country
the
sick
and
wounded
were
carried
with
the
troops
and
there
was
no
further
reserve
of
ammunition
than
that
which
was
packed
in
the
regimental
waggons
cortez
and
his
four
hundred
when
they
essayed
the
same
enterprise
were
not
more
completely
isolated
for
while
the
spaniard
had
staunch
allies
in
the
hereditary
foes
of
the
aztecs
scott
nearest
supports
were
at
puebla
eighty
miles
from
mexico
and
these
numbered
only
effective
soldiers
the
most
adventurous
of
leaders
might
well
have
hesitated
ere
he
plunged
into
the
great
valley
swarming
with
enemies
and
defended
by
all
the
resources
of
a
civilised
state
but
there
was
no
misgiving
in
the
ranks
of
the
americans
with
that
wholesome
contempt
for
a
foreign
foe
which
has
wrought
more
good
than
evil
for
the
race
the
army
moved
forward
without
a
halt
recovering
says
scott
from
the
trance
into
which
the
magnificent
spectacle
had
thrown
them
probably
not
a
man
in
the
column
failed
to
say
to
his
neighbour
or
himself
that
splendid
city
shall
soon
be
ours
the
fortifications
which
protected
mexico
on
the
east
were
found
to
be
impregnable
the
high
ridge
of
el
penon
manned
by
nearly
the
whole
of
santa
anna
army
blocked
the
passage
between
the
lakes
and
deep
morasses
added
to
the
difficulties
of
approach
to
the
south
however
on
the
far
side
of
lake
chalco
lay
a
more
level
tract
but
accessible
only
by
roads
which
the
mexicans
deemed
impracticable
despite
the
difficulties
of
the
route
the
manoeuvre
of
cerro
gordo
was
repeated
on
a
grander
scale
august
to
after
a
toilsome
march
of
miles
from
ayotla
over
the
spurs
of
the
sierras
the
troops
reached
the
great
road
which
leads
to
the
capital
from
the
south
across
this
road
was
more
than
one
line
of
fortifications
to
which
the
mexican
army
had
been
hurriedly
transferred

hacienda
of
san
antonio
six
miles
from
the
city
strengthened
by
and
defended
by
heavy
guns
commanded
the
highway
to
the
east
was
a
morass
and
beyond
the
morass
were
the
blue
waters
of
lake
chalco
while
to
the
west
the
pedregal
a
barren
tract
of
volcanic
scoriae
over
whose
sharp
rocks
and
deep
fissures
neither
horse
nor
vehicle
could
move
flanked
the
american
line
of
march
the
morass
was
absolutely
impassable
august
the
gloomy
solitude
of
the
pedregal
extending
to
the
mountains
five
miles
distant
seemed
equally
forbidding
but
the
engineer
officers
came
once
more
to
the
rescue
a
road
across
the
pedregal
little
better
than
a
mule
track
was
discovered
by
captain
lee
under
cover
of
a
strong
escort
it
was
rapidly
improved
and
pillow
and
divisions
accompanied
by
magruder
battery
were
directed
to
cross
the
waste
of
rocks
beyond
the
pedregal
was
a
good
road
approaching
the
city
from
the
and
by
this
road
the
post
of
san
antonio
might
be
assailed
in
rear
overlooking
the
road
however
as
well
as
the
issues
from
the
pedregal
was
a
high
ridge
backed
by
the
mountains
and
held
by
mexicans
opposite
this
ridge
the
americans
came
out
on
cultivated
ground
but
all
further
progress
was
completely
checked
shortly
after
midday
the
leading
brigade
with
magruder
battery
on
hand
reached
the
summit
of
a
hill
within
a
thousand
yards
of
the
breastworks
magruder
came
at
once
into
action
and
the
infantry
attempted
to
push
forward
but
the
mexican
artillery
was
far
superior
both
in
number
of
pieces
and
weight
of
metal
and
the
ground
was
eminently
unfavourable
for
attack
heavy
cannon
swept
the
front
the
right
of
the
position
was
secured
by
a
deep
ravine
masses
of
infantry
were
observed
in
rear
of
the
intrenchments
and
several
regiments
of
lancers
were
in
close
support
for
three
hours
the
battle
raged
fiercely
on
the
right
the
americans
pushed
forward
crossing
with
extreme
difficulty
an
outlying
angle
of
the
pedregal
covered
with
dense
scrub
and
occupied
the
village
of
contreras
but
elsewhere
they
made
no
impression
they
were
without
cavalry
and
magruder
guns
were
far
too
few
and
feeble
to
keep
down
the
fire
of
the
hostile
batteries
the
infantry
says
scott
could
not
advance
in
column
without
being
mowed
down
by
grape
and
canister
nor
advance
in
line
without
being
ridden
down
by
the
enemy
numerous
horsemen
nor
were
the
mexicans
content
on
this
occasion
to
remain
passively
in
their
works
both
infantry
and
cavalry
attempted
to
drive
the
assailants
back
upon
the
pedregal
and
although
these
counterstrokes
were
successfully
repulsed
when
darkness
fell
the
situation
of
the
troops
was
by
no
means
favourable
heavy
columns
of
mexicans
were
approaching
from
the
city
the
remainder
of
the
american
army
was
opposite
san
antonio
five
miles
distant
on
the
far
side
of
the
pedregal
and
no
support
could
be
expected
to
add
to
their
discomfort
it
rained
heavily
the
thunder
crashed
in
the
mountains
and
torrents
of
water
choked
the
streams
the
men
stood
in
the
darkness
drenched
and
dispirited
and
an
attack
made
by
a
mexican
battalion
induced
general
pillow
to
withdraw
magruder
battery
from
the
ridge
the
senior
subaltern
had
been
killed
gunners
and
as
many
horses
had
fallen
the
slopes
were
covered
with
huge
boulders
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
the
most
strenuous
exertions
that
the
guns
were
brought
down
in
safety
to
the
lower
ground
a
council
of
war
was
then
held
in
contreras
church
and
contrary
to
the
traditionary
conduct
of
such
conventions
a
most
desperate
expedient
was
adopted
the
mexican
reinforcements
strong
had
halted
on
the
main
road
their
advanced
guard
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
village
leaving
two
regiments
to
hold
this
imposing
force
in
check
it
was
determined
to
make
a
night
march
and
turn
the
rear
of
the
intrenchments
on
the
ridge
the
was
beyond
the
pedregal
opposite
san
antonio
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
informed
of
the
projected
movement
i
have
always
understood
says
an
officer
present
in
this
quarter
of
the
field
that
what
was
devised
and
determined
on
was
suggested
by
captain
lee
at
all
events
the
council
was
closed
by
his
saying
that
he
desired
to
return
to
general
scott
with
the
decision
and
that
as
it
was
late
the
decision
must
be
given
as
soon
as
possible
since
general
scott
wished
him
to
return
in
time
to
give
directions
for
during
the
council
and
for
hours
after
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
whilst
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
one
could
move
only
by
groping
the
pedregal
was
infested
by
straggling
bands
of
mexicans
and
yet
over
those
five
miles
of
desolation
with
no
guide
but
the
wind
or
an
occasional
flash
of
lightning
lee
unaccompanied
by
a
single
orderly
made
his
way
to
scott
headquarters
this
perilous
adventure
was

the
greatest
feat

physical
and
moral
courage
performed
by
any
individual
during
the
entire
campaign
august
the
night
march
although
it
entailed
the
passage
of
a
deep
ravine
and
was
so
slow
that
one
company
in
two
hours
made
no
more
than
four
hundred
yards
was
completely
successful
the
mexicans
trusting
to
the
strength
of
their
position
and
to
the
presence
of
the
reinforcements
had
neglected
to
guard
their
left
the
lesson
of
cerro
gordo
had
been
forgotten
the
storming
parties
guided
by

lee
beauregard
and
gustavus
smith
established
themselves
under
cover
of
the
darkness
within
five
hundred
paces
of
the
intrenchments
and
as
the
day
broke
the
works
were
carried
at
the
first
rush
seventeen
minutes
after
the
signal
had
been
given
the
garrison
attacked
in
front
and
rear
simultaneously
was
completely
dispersed
mexicans
were
captured
and
nearly
as
many
killed
americans
rank
and
file
were
engaged
and
the
losses
did
not
exceed
scott
memoirs
the
reinforcements
unable
to
intervene
and
probably
demoralised
by
this
defeat
fell
back
to
the
village
of
churubusco
and
san
antonio
was
evacuated
the
pursuit
was
hotly
pressed
churubusco
was
heavily
bombarded
for
two
hours
the
american
batteries
played
upon
the
church
and
hacienda
both
strongly
fortified
and
after
a
counterstroke
had
been
beaten
back
a
vigorous
onslaught
made
by
the
whole
line
of
battle
compelled
the
enemy
to
give
way
a
brilliant
charge
of
general
shields
brigade
dispersed
their
last
reserves
and
the
whole
of
the
hostile
army
fled
in
confusion
to
the
city
the
american
cavalry
followed
at
speed
using
their
sabres
freely
on
the
masses
and
one
squadron
not
hearing
the
recall
dashed
up
to
the
very
gates
of
the
city
scott
losses
amounted
to
including
officers
the
mexican
casualties
were
prisoners
and
killed
and
wounded
were
abandoned
and
a
still
more
valuable
capture
a
large
supply
of
ammunition
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
victors
magruder
battery
it
appears
was
retained
in
reserve
throughout
the
battle
of
churubusco
and
jackson
share
in
the
victory
was
confined
to
the
engagement
of
the
previous
day
but
his
small
charge
of
three
guns
had
been
handled
with
skill
and
daring
magruder
was
more
than
satisfied
in
a
few
moments
ran
his
official
report
lieutenant
jackson
commanding
the
second
section
of
the
battery
who
had
opened
fire
upon
the
enemy
works
from
a
position
on
the
right
hearing
our
fire
still
further
in
front
advanced
in
handsome
style
and
kept
up
the
fire
with
equal
briskness
and
effect
his
conduct
was
equally
conspicuous
during
the
whole
day
and
i
can
not
too
highly
commend
him
to
the
favourable
consideration
the
extreme
vigour
with
which
the
americans
had
prosecuted
their
operations
now
came
to
an
untimely
pause
after
his
double
victory
at
contreras
and
churubusco
general
scott
proposed
an
armistice
the
whole
of
the
mexican
army
had
been
encountered
it
had
been
decisively
defeated
its
losses
in
men
and
materiel
had
been
very
heavy
the
troops
were
utterly
demoralised
the
people
were
filled
with
consternation
and
a
rapid
advance
would
probably
have
been
followed
by
an
immediate
peace
but
scott
was
unwilling
to
drive
his
foes
to
desperation
and
he
appears
to
have
believed
that
if
they
were
spared
all
further
humiliation
they
would
accede
without
further
resistance
to
his
demands
the
mexicans
however
were
only
playing
for
time
during
the
negotiations
in
direct
defiance
of
the
terms
of
the
armistice
santa
anna
strengthened
his
fortifications
rallied
his
scattered
army
and
prepared
once
more
to
confront
the
invader
scott
ultimatum
was
rejected
and
on
september
hostilities
were
renewed
september
three
days
later
the
position
of
molino
del
rey
garrisoned
by
the
choicest
of
the
mexican
troops
was
stormed
at
dawn
but
the
enemy
had
benefited
by
his
respite
the
fighting
was
desperate
americans
were
killed
and
wounded
before
the
intrenchments
and
strong
buildings
were
finally
carried
and
although
the
mexicans
again
lost
men
including
two
generals
their
spirit
of
resistance
was
not
yet
wholly
crushed
driven
from
their
outworks
they
had
fallen
back
on
a
still
more
formidable
line
behind
the
molino
del
rey
rose
the
hill
of
chapultepec
crowned
by
the
great
castle
which
had
been
the
palace
of
montezuma
and
of
the
spanish
viceroys
now
the
military
college
of
the
republic
and
the
strongest
of
her
fortresses
three
miles
from
the
city
walls
the
stronghold
completely
barred
the
line
of
advance
on
the
san
cosme
gate
heavy
guns
mounted
on
the
lofty
bastions
which
encircled
the
citadel
commanded
every
road
and
the
outflanking
movements
which
had
hitherto
set
at
nought
the
walls
and
parapets
of
the
mexicans
were
here
impracticable
still
careful
reconnaissance
had
shown
that
with
all
its
difficulties
this
was
the
most
favourable
approach
for
the
invading
army
the
gates
of
belen
and
san
antonio
were
beset
by
obstacles
even
more
impracticable
the
ground
over
which
the
troops
would
advance
to
storm
the
fortress
was
far
firmer
than
elsewhere
there
was
ample
space
for
the
american
batteries
and
if
the
hill
were
taken
the
mexicans
retreating
along
two
narrow
causeways
with
deep
marshes
on
either
hand
might
easily
be
deprived
of
all
opportunity
of
rallying
september
on
the
night
of
the
four
batteries
of
heavy
guns
were
established
within
easy
range
on
the
they
opened
fire
and
the
next
morning
the
american
army
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
advanced
to
the
assault
in
the
victory
of
molino
del
rey
battery
had
taken
little
part
jackson
posted
with
his
section
on
the
extreme
flank
of
the
line
had
dispersed
a
column
of
cavalry
which
threatened
a
charge
but
with
this
brief
interlude
of
action
he
had
been
merely
a
spectator
at
chapultepec
he
was
more
fortunate
pillow
division
to
which
the
battery
was
attached
attacked
the
mexicans
in
front
while
worth
division
assailed
them
from
the
north
the
infantry
connecting
the
two
attacks
moved
along
a
road
which
skirts
the
base
of
the
hill
and
magruder
was
ordered
to
detach
a
section
of
his
battery
in
support
jackson
was
selected
for
the
duty
and
as
he
approached
the
enemy
position
dangers
multiplied
at
every
step
the
ground
alongside
was
so
marshy
that
the
guns
were
unable
to
leave
the
road
a
mexican
fieldpiece
covered
by
a
breastwork
raked
the
causeway
from
end
to
end
while
from
the
heights
of
chapultepec
cannon
of
large
calibre
poured
down
a
destructive
fire
the
infantry
suffered
terribly
it
was
impossible
to
advance
along
the
narrow
track
and
when
the
guns
were
ordered
up
the
situation
was
in
no
way
bettered
nearly
every
horse
was
killed
or
wounded
a
deep
ditch
cut
across
the
road
hindered
effective
action
and
the
only
position
where
reply
to
the
enemy
fire
was
possible
lay
beyond
this
obstacle
despite
the
losses
of
his
command
jackson
managed
to
lift
one
gun
across
by
hand
but
his
men
became
demoralised
they
left
their
posts
the
example
of
their
lieutenant
walking
up
and
down
on
the
road
and
exclaiming
calmly
there
is
no
danger
see
i
am
not
hit
failed
to
inspire
them
with
confidence
many
had
already
fallen
the
infantry
with
the
exception
of
a
small
escort
which
held
its
ground
with
difficulty
had
disappeared
and
general
worth
observing
jackson
perilous
situation
sent
him
orders
to
retire
he
replied
it
was
more
dangerous
to
withdraw
than
to
stand
fast
and
if
they
would
give
him
fifty
veterans
he
would
rather
attempt
the
capture
of
the
breastwork
at
this
juncture
magruder
losing
his
horse
as
he
galloped
forward
reached
the
road
the
ditch
was
crowded
with
soldiers
many
wounded
many
already
dead
many
whose
hearts
had
failed
them
beyond
on
the
narrow
causeway
the
one
gun
which
jackson
had
brought
across
the
ditch
was
still
in
action
deserted
by
his
gunners
and
abandoned
by
the
escort
which
had
been
ordered
to
support
him
the
young
subaltern
still
held
his
ground
with
the
sole
assistance
of
a
sergeant
of
stauncher
mettle
than
the
rest
he
was
loading
and
firing
his
solitary
rejoicing
as
became
the
son
of
a
warrior
race
in
the
hot
breath
of
battle
and
still
more
in
the
isolation
of
his
perilous
position
to
stand
alone
in
the
forefront
of
the
fight
defying
the
terrors
from
which
others
shrank
was
the
situation
which
of
all
others
he
most
coveted
and
under
the
walls
of
chapultepec
answering
shot
for
shot
and
plying
sponge
and
handspike
with
desperate
energy
the
fierce
instincts
of
the
soldier
were
fully
gratified
nor
was
magruder
the
man
to
proffer
prudent
counsels
a
second
gun
was
hoisted
across
the
ditch
the
men
rallied
the
mexican
artillery
was
gradually
overpowered
and
the
breastwork
stormed
the
crisis
of
the
struggle
was
already
past
pillow
troops
had
driven
the
enemy
from
their
intrenchments
at
the
base
of
the
hill
and
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
majestic
cypresses
which
still
bear
the
name
of
the
grove
of
montezuma
and
up
the
rugged
slopes
which
tower
above
them
pressed
the
assaulting
columns
a
redoubt
which
stood
midway
up
the
height
was
carried
the
mexicans
fell
back
from
shelter
to
shelter
but
amid
smoke
and
flame
the
scaling
ladders
were
borne
across
the
castle
ditch
and
reared
against
the
lofty
walls
were
soon
covered
with
streams
of
men
the
leaders
hurled
from
the
battlements
on
to
the
crowd
below
failed
to
make
good
their
footing
but
there
were
others
to
take
their
places
the
supports
came
thronging
up
the
enemy
assailed
in
front
and
flank
drew
back
disheartened
and
after
a
short
struggle
the
american
colours
displayed
upon
the
keep
announced
to
the
citizens
of
mexico
that
chapultepec
had
been
captured
yet
the
victory
was
not
complete
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
had
fled
from
their
intrenchments
before
the
castle
had
been
stormed
and
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
in
wild
confusion
were
crowding
in
panic
on
the
causeways
but
their
numbers
were
formidable
and
the
city
should
the
army
be
rallied
was
capable
of
a
protracted
defence
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
if
the
battle
was
to
be
decisive
of
the
war
the
disorder
on
chapultepec
was
hardly
less
than
that
which
existed
in
the
ranks
of
the
defeated
mexicans
many
of
the
stormers
had
dispersed
in
search
of
plunder
and
regiments
and
brigades
had
become
hopelessly
intermingled
in
the
assault
of
the
rocky
hill
still
the
pursuit
was
prompt
towards
the
san
cosme
gate
several
of
the
younger
officers
a
lieutenant
by
name
ulysses
grant
amongst
the
foremost
followed
the
enemy
with
such
men
as
they
could
collect
and
guns
were
soon
abreast
of
the
fighting
line
his
teams
had
been
destroyed
by
the
fire
of
the
mexican
batteries
those
of
his
waggons
posted
further
to
the
rear
had
partially
escaped
to
disengage
the
dead
animals
from
the
limbers
and
to
replace
them
by
others
would
have
wasted
many
minutes
and
he
had
eagerly
suggested
to
magruder
that
the
guns
should
be
attached
to
the
instead
of
to
their
own
permission
was
given
and
in
a
few
moments
his
section
was
thundering
past
the
cliffs
of
chapultepec
coming
into
action
within
close
range
of
the
flying
mexicans
every
shot
told
on
their
demoralised
masses
but
before
the
san
cosme
gate
the
enemy
made
a
last
effort
to
avert
defeat
fresh
troops
were
brought
up
to
man
the
outworks
the
houses
and
gardens
which
lined
the
road
were
filled
with
skirmishers
from
the
high
parapets
of
the
flat
a
hail
of
bullets
struck
the
head
of
the
pursuing
column
and
again
and
again
the
american
infantry
without
cover
and
with
little
space
for
movement
recoiled
from
the
attack
the
situation
of
the
invading
army
despite
the
brilliant
victory
of
chapultepec
was
not
yet
free
from
peril
the
greater
part
of
the
mexican
forces
was
still
intact
the
city
contained
inhabitants
and
general
scott
battalions
had
dwindled
to
the
strength
of
a
small
division
in
the
various
battles
before
the
capital
nearly
officers
and
men
had
fallen
and
the
soldiers
who
encompassed
the
walls
of
the
great
metropolis
were
spent
with
fighting
officers
and
men
fell
at
chapultepec
memoirs
one
spark
of
the
stubborn
courage
which
bore
cortez
and
his
paladins
through
the
hosts
of
montezuma
might
have
made
of
that
stately
city
a
second
saragossa
it
was
eminently
defensible
the
churches
the
convents
the
public
buildings
constructed
with
that
solidity
which
is
peculiarly
spanish
formed
each
of
them
a
fortress
the
broad
streets
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
rendered
concentration
at
any
threatened
point
an
easy
matter
and
beyond
the
walls
were
broad
ditches
and
a
deep
canal
nor
was
the
strength
of
the
city
the
greatest
of
difficulties
vera
cruz
his
base
of
operations
was
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
distant
puebla
his
nearest
eighty
miles
he
had
abandoned
his
communications
his
army
was
dependent
for
food
on
a
hostile
population
in
moving
round
lake
chalco
and
attacking
the
city
from
the
south
he
had
burned
his
boats
a
siege
or
an
investment
were
alike
impossible
a
short
march
would
place
the
enemy
army
across
his
line
of
retreat
and
nothing
would
have
been
easier
for
the
mexicans
than
to
block
the
road
where
it
passes
between
the
sierras
and
the
lake
guerillas
were
already
hovering
in
the
hills
one
single
repulse
before
the
gates
of
the
capital
would
have
raised
the
country
in
rear
and
hemmed
in
by
superior
numbers
and
harassed
by
a
cavalry
which
was
at
least
equal
to
the
task
of
cutting
off
supplies
the
handful
of
americans
must
have
cut
their
way
through
to
puebla
or
have
succumbed
to
starvation
such
considerations
had
doubtless
been
at
the
root
of
the
temporising
policy
which
had
been
pursued
after
churubusco
but
the
uselessness
of
had
then
been
proved
the
conviction
had
become
general
that
a
desperate
enterprise
could
only
be
pushed
to
a
successful
issue
by
desperate
tactics
and
every
available
battalion
was
hurried
forward
to
the
assault
before
the
san
cosme
gate
the
pioneers
were
ordered
up
and
within
the
suburb
pick
and
crowbar
forced
a
passage
from
house
to
house
the
guns
moving
slowly
forward
battered
the
crumbling
masonry
at
closest
range
the
mexicans
were
driven
back
from
breastwork
to
breastwork
and
a
mountain
howitzer
which
lieutenant
grant
had
posted
on
the
tower
of
a
neighbouring
church
played
with
terrible
effect
at
a
range
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
on
the
defenders
of
the
gate
by
eight
in
the
evening
the
suburb
had
been
cleared
and
the
americans
were
firmly
established
within
the
walls
to
the
before
the
belen
gate
another
column
had
been
equally
successful
during
the
night
santa
anna
withdrew
his
troops
and
when
day
dawned
the
white
flag
was
seen
flying
from
the
citadel
after
a
sharp
fight
with
convicts
whom
the
fugitive
president
had
released
the
invaders
occupied
the
city
and
the
war
was
virtually
at
an
end
from
cerro
gordo
to
chapultepec
the
power
of
discipline
had
triumphed
an
army
of
men
fighting
in
their
own
country
and
supported
by
a
numerous
artillery
had
been
defeated
by
an
invading
force
of
the
strength
yet
the
mexicans
had
shown
no
lack
of
courage
at
chapultepec
and
molino
del
rey
as
on
many
other
occasions
says
grant
they
stood
up
as
well
as
any
troops
ever
did
grant
memoirs
volume
page
but
their
officers
were
inexperienced
the
men
were
and
against
an
army
of
regular
soldiers
well
led
and
obedient
their
untutored
valour
notwithstanding
their
superior
numbers
had
proved
of
no
avail
they
had
early
become
demoralised
their
strongest
positions
had
been
rendered
useless
by
the
able
manoeuvres
of
their
adversaries
everywhere
they
had
been
they
had
never
been
permitted
to
fight
on
the
ground
which
they
had
prepared
and
in
almost
every
single
engagement
they
had
been
surprised
nor
had
the
government
escaped
the
infection
which
had
turned
the
hearts
of
the
troops
to
water
september
the
energy
of
the
pursuit
after
the
fall
of
chapultepec
had
wrought
its
full
effect
and
on
september
the
city
of
mexico
was
surrendered
without

was

were

to

and
in

the
american

were
fain
to
content
themselves
with
their
ordinary
duties
it
can
not
be
said
that
jackson
had
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
which
fortune
had
thrown
in
his
way
as
eagerly
as
he
had
snatched
at
the
chance
of
employment
in

field
artillery
he
had
welcomed
the
tactical
emergency
which
had
given
him
sole
command
of
his
section
at

it
was
a
small
charge
but
he
had
utilised
it
to
the
utmost
and
it
had
filled
the
cup
of
his
ambition
to
the
brim
ambitious
he
certainly
was
he
confessed
says
dabney
to
an
intimate
friend
that
the
order
of
general
pillow
separating
his
section
on
the
day
of
chapultepec
from
his
captain
had
excited
his
abiding
gratitude
so
much
so
that
while
the
regular
officers
were
rather
inclined
to
depreciate
the
general
as
an
unprofessional
soldier
he
loved
him
because
he
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
win
distinction
his
friends
asked
him
long
after
the
war
if
he
felt
no
trepidation
when
so
many
were
falling
round
him
he
replied
no
the
only
anxiety
of
which
i
was
conscious
during
the
engagements
was
a
fear
lest
i
should
not

to

placing

said
with

seeing
that

had
called

for

you
slaughtered

then
held
out

no
greater
compliment
says
general
gibbon
could
have
been
paid

young
officer

apparently
did
not
know
he
had
done
anything
remarkable
till
his
general
told
him
so
letter
to
the
author
magruder
could
find
no
praise
high
enough
for
his
industry
his
capacity
and
his
gallantry
and
within
eighteen
months
of
his
first
joining
his
regiment
he
was
breveted
major
such
promotion
was
phenomenal
even
in
the
mexican
war
and
none
of
his
west
point
comrades
made
so
great
a
stride
in
rank
his
future
in
his
profession
was
assured
he
had
acquired
something
more
than
the
spurs
of
a
field
officer
in
his
seven
months
of
service
a
subaltern
it
has
been
said
learns
but
little
of
the
higher
art
of
war
in
the
course
of
a
campaign
his
daily
work
so
engrosses
his
attention
that
he
has
little
leisure
to
reflect
on
the
lessons
in
strategy
and
tactics
which
unfold
themselves
before
him
without
maps
and
without
that
information
of
the
enemy
numbers
and
dispositions
which
alone
renders
the
manoeuvres
intelligible
it
is
difficult
even
where
the
inclination
exists
to
discuss
or
criticise
the
problems
tactical
and
strategical
with
which
the
general
has
to
deal
but
siege
and
battle
long
marches
and
rough
roads
gave
the
young
american
officers
an
insight
into
the
practical
difficulties
of
war
it
is
something
to
have
seen
how
human
nature
shows
itself
under
fire
how
easily
panics
may
be
generated
how
positions
that
seem
impregnable
may
be
rendered
weak
to
have
witnessed
the
effect
of
surprise
and
to
have
realised
the
strength
of
a
vigorous
attack
it
is
something
too
if
a
man
learns
his
own
worth
in
situations
of
doubt
and
danger
and
if
he
finds
as
did
jackson
that
battle
sharpens
his
faculties
and
makes
his
more
perfect
his
judgment
clearer
and
more
prompt
the
gain
in
is
of
the
utmost
value
moreover
whether
a
young
soldier
learns
much
or
little
from
his
first
campaign
depends
on
his
intellectual
powers
and
his
previous
training
jackson
brain
as
his
steady
progress
at
west
point
proves
was
of
a
capacity
beyond
the
average
he
was
naturally
reflective
if
at
the
military
academy
he
had
heard
little
of
war
if
during
his
service
in
mexico
his
knowledge
was
insufficient
to
enable
him
to
compare
general
scott
operations
with
those
of
the
great
captains
he
had
at
least
been
trained
to
think
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
his
experience
was
cast
away
he
was
no
thoughtless
subaltern
but
already
an
earnest
soldier
and
in
after
times
when
he
came
to
study
for
himself
the
campaigns
of
washington
and
napoleon
we
may
be
certain
that
the
teaching
he
found
there
was
made
doubly
impressive
when
read
by
the
light
of
what
he
had
seen
himself
nor
is
it
mere
conjecture
to
assert
that
in
his
first
campaign
his
experience
was
of
peculiar
value
to
a
future
general
of
the
southern
confederacy
some
of
the
regiments

fought
under

were

successors

for

or
even
for
a
shorter
term
and
serving
under
their
own
officers
several
of
these
regiments
had
fought
well
others
had
behaved
indifferently
and
the
problem
of
how
discipline
was
to
be
maintained
in
battle
amongst
these
unprofessional
soldiers
obtruded
itself
as
unpleasantly
in
mexico
as
it
had
in
the
wars
with
england
amongst
the
regular
officers
accustomed
to
the
absolute
subordination
of
the
army
the
question
provoked
perplexity
and
discussion
so
small
was
the
military
establishment
of
the
states
that
in
case
of
any
future
war
the
army
as
in
mexico
would
be
largely
composed
of
volunteers
and
despite
the
high
intelligence
and
warlike
enthusiasm
of
the
citizen

it
was
evident
that
they
were

reliable
than
the

even

for

in

found
himself
within
the
sphere

feminine
attractions
the
effect
on
the
stripling
soldier
who
stark
fighter
as
he
was
had
seen
no

of
life
than
was

be

in

within

point
may
be
easily
imagined
who
the
magnet
was
he
never
confessed
but
that
he
went
near
losing
his
heart
to
some
charming
senorita
of
sangre
azul
he
more
than
once
acknowledged
and
he
took
much
trouble
to
appear
to
advantage
in
her
eyes
the
deficiencies
in
his
education
which
prevented
his
full
enjoyment
of
social
pleasures
were
soon
made
up
he
not
only
learned
to
dance
an
accomplishment
which
must
have
taxed
his
perseverance
to
the
utmost
but
he
spent
some
months
in
learning
spanish
and
it
is
significant
that
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
retained
a
copious
vocabulary
of
those
tender
diminutives
which
fall
so
gracefully
from
spanish
lips
but
during
his
stay
in
mexico
other
and
more
lasting
influences
were
at
work
despite
the
delights
of
her
delicious
climate
where
the
roses
bloom
the
whole
year
round
the
charms
of
her
romantic
scenery
and
the
fascinations
of
her
daughters
serious
nature
soon
asserted
itself
the
constant
round
of
light
amusements
and
simple
duties
grew
distasteful
the
impress
of
his
mother
teachings
and
example
was
there
to
guide
him
and
his
native
reverence
for
all
that
was
good
and
true
received
an
unexpected
impulse
there
were
not
wanting
in
the
american
army
men
who
had
a
higher
ideal
of
duty
than
mere
devotion
to
the
business
of
their
profession
the
officer
commanding
the
first
artillery
colonel
frank
taylor
possessed
that
earnest
faith
which
is
not
content

this
good
man
says
dabney
was
accustomed
to
labour
as
a
father
for
the
religious
welfare
of
his
young
officers
and
during
the
summer
campaign
his
instructions
and
prayers
had
produced
so
much
effect
as
to
awake
an
abiding
anxiety
and
spirit
of
inquiry
in
jackson
mind
the
latter
had
little
prejudice
in
favour
of
any
particular
sect
or
church
there
was
no
state
establishment
in
the
united
states
his
youth
had
been
passed
in
a
household
where
christianity
was
practically
unknown
and
with
characteristic
independence
he
determined
to
discover
for
himself
the
rule
that
he
should
follow
his
researches
took
a
course
which
his
presbyterian
ancestors
would
assuredly
have
condemned
but
jackson
mind
was
singularly
open
and
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
yield
to
prejudice
soon
after
peace
was
declared
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
number
of
priests
belonging
to
one
of
the
great
religious
orders
of
the
catholic
church
they
had
invited
him
to
take
up
his
quarters
with
them
and
when
he
determined
to
examine
for
himself
into
the
doctrine
of
the
ancient
faith
he
applied
through
them
for
an
introduction
to
the
archbishop
of
mexico
several
interviews
took
place
between
the
aged
ecclesiastic
and
the
young
soldier
jackson
departed
unsatisfied
he
acknowledged
that
the
prelate
was
a
sincere
and
devout
christian
and
he
was
impressed
as
much
with
his
kindness
as
his
learning
but
he
left
mexico
without
any
settled
convictions
on
the
subject
which
now
absorbed
his
thoughts
june
on

having
been
signed
at

end
of

the
last
of
the
american
troops
marched
out
of

conquered
capital
battery
was
sent
to
fort
hamilton
on
long
island
seven
miles
below
new
york
and
there
with
his
honours
thick
upon
him
he
settled
down
to
the
quiet
life
of
a
small
garrison
he
had
gone
out
to
mexico
a
second
lieutenant
he
had
come
back
a
he
had
won
a
name
in
the
army
and
his
native
state
had
enrolled
him
amongst
her
heroes
he
had
gone
out
an
unformed
youth
he
had
come
back
a
man
and
a
proved
leader
of
men
he
had
been
known
merely
as
an
indefatigable
student
and
a
somewhat
unsociable
companion
he
had
come
back
with
a
reputation
for
daring
courage
not
only
the
courage
which
glories
in
swift
action
and
the
excitement
of
the
charge
but
courage
of
an
enduring
quality
and
in
that
distant
country
he
had
won
more
than
fame
he
had
already
learned
something
of
the
vanity
of
temporal
success
he
had
gone
out
with
a
vague
notion
of
ruling
his
life
in
accordance
with
moral
precepts
and
philosophic
maxims
but
he
was
to
be
guided
henceforward
by
loftier
principles
than
even
devotion
to
duty
and
regard
for
honour
and
from
the
path
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
in
mexico
he
never
deviated

there
is
little
to
tell
his
friend
and
mentor
colonel
taylor
was
in
command
the

once
an
officer
of
dragoons
was
a
man
of
persuasive
eloquence
and
earnest
zeal
and
surrounded
by
influences
which
had
now
become
congenial
the
young
major
of
artillery
pursued
the
religious
studies
he
had
begun
in
mexico
there
was
some
doubt
whether
he
had
been
baptised
as
a
child
he
was
anxious
that
no
uncertainty
should
exist
as
to
his
adhesion
to
christianity
but
he
was
unwilling
that
the
sacrament
should
bind
him
to
any
particular
sect
on
the
understanding
that
no
surrender
of
judgment
would
be
involved
he
was
baptised
and
received
his
first
communion
in
the
episcopal
church
two
years
passed
without
incident
and
then
jackson
was
transferred
to
florida
in
his
new
quarters
his
stay
was
brief
in
march
he
was
appointed
professor
of
artillery
tactics
and
natural
philosophy
at
the
virginia
military
institute
his
success
for
such
he
deemed
it
was
due
to
his
own
merit
one
of
his
mexican
comrades

what
had
been

of

at

if
the
course
had
been
one
year
longer
he
would
have
graduated
at
the
head
of
his
class
this
voluntary
testimonial
of
his
brother
cadets
had
not
passed
unheeded
it
had
weight
as
the
best
evidence
of
his
thoroughness
and
application
with
the
board
of
visitors
and
jackson
was
unanimously
elected
the

where
the
great
forests
stand
round
about

the

untainted
from

the
college
which
washington
greatest
of
virginians
and
greatest
of
american
soldiers
had
endowed
under
the
shadow
of
its
towers
the
state
had
found
an
appropriate
site
for
her
military
school
the
cadets
of
the
institute
although
they
wore
a
uniform
were
taught
by
officers
of
the
regular
army
were
disciplined
as
soldiers
and
spent
some
months
of
their
course
in
camp
were
not
destined
for
a
military
career
all
aspirants
for
commissions
in
the
united
states
army
had
to
pass
through
west
point
and
the
training
of
the
state
colleges
for
virginia
was
not
solitary
in
the
possession
of
such
an
institution
however
much
it
may
have
benefited
both
the
minds
and
bodies
of
the
rising
generation
was
of
immediate
value
only
to
those
who
became
officers
of
the
state
militia
still
in
all
essential
respects
the
military
institute
was
little
behind
west
point
the
discipline
was
as
strict
the
drill
but
little
less
precise
the
cadets
had
their
own
officers
and
their
own
sergeants
and
the
whole
establishment
was
administered
on
a
military
footing
no
pains
were
spared
either
by
the
state
or
the
faculty
to
maintain
the
peculiar
character
of
the
school
and
the
little
battalion
although
the
members
were
hardly
likely
to
see
service
was
as
carefully
trained
as
if
each
private
in
the
ranks
might
one
day
become
a
general
officer
it
was
fortunate
indeed
for
virginia
when
she
submitted
her
destinies
to
the
arbitrament
of
war
that
some
amongst
her
statesmen
had
been
firm
to
the
conviction
that
to
defend
one
country
is
a
task
not
a
whit
less
honourable
than
to
serve
her
in
the
ways
of
peace
she
was
unable
to
avert
defeat
but
she
more
than
redeemed
her
honour
and
the
efficiency
of
her
troops
was
in
no
small
degree
due
to
the
training
so
many
of
her
officers
had
received
at
the
military
institute
still
notwithstanding
its
practical
use
to
the
state
the
offer
of
a
chair
at
lexington
would
probably
have
attracted
but
few
of
contemporaries
but
while
campaigning
was
entirely
to
his
taste
life
in
barracks
was
the
reverse
in
those
unenlightened
days
to
be
known
as
an
able
and
zealous
soldier
was
no
passport
to
preferment
so
long
as
an
officer
escaped
censure
his
promotion
was
sure
he
might
reach
without
further
effort
the
highest
prizes
the
service
offered
and
the
chances
of
the
dull
and
indolent
were
quite
as
good
as
those
of
the
capable
and
energetic
the
one
had
no
need
for
the
other
no
incentive
to
and
it
was
very
generally
neglected
unless
war
intervened
and
nothing
seemed
more
improbable
than
another
campaign
even
a
napoleon
would
have
had
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
jackson
caught
eagerly
at
the
opportunity
of
freeing
himself
from
an
unprofitable
groove
he
believed
he
said
that
a
man
who
had
turned
with
a
good
military
reputation
to
pursuits
of
a
character
and
had
vigorously
prosecuted
his
mental
improvement
would
have
more
chance
of
success
in
war
than
those
who
had
remained
in
the
treadmill
of
the
garrison
it
was
with
a
view
then
of
fitting
himself
for
command
that
jackson
broke
away
from
the
restraints
of
regimental
life
not
because
those
restraints
were
burdensome
or
distasteful
in
themselves
but
because
he
felt
that
whilst
making
the
machine
they
might
destroy
the
man
those
responsible
for
the
efficiency
of
the
united
states
army
had
not
yet
learned
that
the
mind
must
be
trained
as
well
as
the
body
that
drill
is
not
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
education
that
unless
an
officer
is
trusted
with
responsibility
in
peace
he
is
but
too
apt
to
lose
all
power
of
initiative
in
war
that
jackson
ideas
were
sound
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
many
of
the
most
distinguished
generals
in
the
civil
war
were
men
whose
previous
career
had
been
analogous
to
his
own
amongst
these
may
be
mentioned
grant
sherman
and
mcclellan
lee
himself
as
an
engineer
had
but
small
acquaintance
with
regimental
life
the
men
who
saved
india
for
england
in
the
great
mutiny
were
of
the
same
type
his
duties
at
lexington
were
peculiar
as
professor
of
artillery
he
was
responsible
for
little
more
than
the
drill
of
the
cadets
and
their
instruction
in
the
theory
of
gunnery
the
tactics
of
artillery
as
the
word
is
understood
in
europe
he
was
not
called
upon
to
impart
optics
mechanics
and
astronomy
were
his
special
subjects
and
he
seems
strangely
out
of
place
in
expounding
their
dry
formulas
in
the
library
of
the
institute
he
found
every
opportunity
of
increasing
his
professional
knowledge
he
was
an
untiring
reader
and
he
read
to
learn
the
wars
of
napoleon
were
his
constant
study
he
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
his
genius
the
swiftness
the
daring
and
the
energy
of
his
movements
appealed
to
his
every
instinct
unfortunately
both
for
the
institute
and
his
popularity
it
was
not
his
business
to
lecture
on
military
history
we
can
well
imagine
him
as
a
teacher
of
the
art
of
war
describing
to
the
impressionable
youths
around
him
the
dramatic
incidents
of
some
famous
campaign
following
step
by
step
the
skilful
strategy
that
brought
about
such
victories
as
austerlitz
and
jena
the
advantage
would
then
have
been
with
his
pupils
in
the
work
assigned
to
him
it
was
the
teacher
that
benefited
he
was
by
no
means
successful
as
an
instructor
of
the
higher
mathematics
although
the
theories
of
light
and
motion
were
doubtless
a
branch
of
learning
which
the
cadets
particularly
detested
his
methods
of
teaching
made
it
even
more
repellent
a
thorough
master
of
his
subject
he
lacked
altogether
the
power
of
aiding
others
to
master
it
no
flashes
of
humour
relieved
the
tedium
of
his
long
and
demonstrations
he
never
descended
to
the
level
of
his
understanding
nor
did
he
appreciate
their
difficulties
facts
presented
themselves
to
his
intellect
in
few
lights
as
one
of
his
chief
characteristics
as
a
commander
was
the
clearness
with
which
he
perceived
the
end
to
be
aimed
at
and
the
shortest
way
of
reaching
it
so
in
his
explanations
to
his
stumbling
class
he
could
only
repeat
the
process
by
which
he
himself
had
solved
the
problem
at
issue
we
may
well
believe
that
his
nature
trained
to
intense
application
overlooked
the
fact
that
others
weaker
and
less
gifted
could
not
surmount
unaided
the
obstacles
which
only
aroused
his
own
masterful
instincts
nevertheless
his
conscientious
industry
was
not
entirely
thrown
away
to
the
brighter
intellects
in
his
class
he
communicated
accurate
scholarship
and
although
the
majority
lagged
far
behind
the
thoroughness
of
his
mental
drill
was
most
useful
to
himself
perhaps
even
more
than
to
the
cadets
to
the
death
of
his
first
wife
daughter
of
the
reverend
junkin
president
of
washington
college
after
they
had
been
married
but
fourteen
months
the
solution
of
his
religious
difficulties
and
his
reception
into
the
presbyterian
church
a
five
months
tour
in
europe
through
scotland
england
germany
switzerland
and
italy
his
marriage
to
miss
morrison
daughter
of
a
north
carolina
clergyman
such
were
the
chief
landmarks
of
his
life
at
lexington
ten
years
with
their
burden
of
joy
and
sorrow
passed
away
of
intense
interest
to
the
individual
but
to
the
world
a
story
dull
and
commonplace
jackson
was
by
no
means
a
man
of
mark
in
rockbridge
county
although
his
early
shyness
had
somewhat
worn
off
he
was
still
as
reserved
as
he
had
been
at
west
point
his
confidence
was
rarely
given
outside
his
own
home
intimates
he
had
few
either
at
the
institute
or
elsewhere
still
he
was
not
in
the
least
unsociable
and
there
were
many
houses
where
he
was
always
welcome
the
academic
atmosphere
of
lexington
did
not
preclude
a
certain
amount
of
gaiety
the
presence
of
washington
college
and
the
military
institute
drew
together
a
large
number
of
families
during
the
summer
and
fair
visitors
thronged
the
leafy
avenues
of
the
little
town
during
these
pleasant
months
the
officers
and
cadets
as
became
their
cloth
were
always
well
to
the
fore
recreation
was
the
order
of
the
day
and
a
round
of
entertainments
enlivened
the
commencements
major
jackson
attended
these
gatherings
with
unfailing
regularity
but
soon
after
his
arrival
he
drew
the
line
at
dancing
and
musical
parties
became
the
limit
of
his
dissipation
he
was
anything
but
a
convivial
companion
he
never
smoked
he
was
a
strict
teetotaller
and
he
never
touched
a
card
his
diet
for
reasons
of
health
was
of
a
most
sparing
kind
nothing
could
tempt
him
to
partake
of
food
between
his
regular
hours
and
for
many
years
he
abstained
from
both
tea
and
coffee
in
those
peaceful
times
moreover
there
was
nothing
either
commanding
or
captivating
about
the
professor
of
artillery
his
little
romance
in
mexico
had
given
him
no
taste
for
trivial
pleasures
and
his
somewhat
formal
manner
was
not
redeemed
by
any
special
charm
of
feature
the
brow
and
jaw
were
undoubtedly
powerful
but
the
eyes
were
gentle
and
the
voice
so
mild
and
soft
as
to
belie
altogether
the
set
determination
of
the
thin
straight
lips
yet
at
the
same
time
if
jackson
was
not
formed
for
general
society
he
was
none
the
less
capable
of
making
himself
exceedingly
agreeable
in
a
restricted
and
congenial
circle
young
and
old
when
once
they
had
gained
his
confidence
came
under
the
spell
of
his
noble
nature
and
if
his
friends
were
few
they
were
very
firm
why
jackson
should
have
preferred
the
presbyterian
denomination
to
all
others
we
are
nowhere
told
but
whatever
his
reasons
may
have
been
he
was
a
most
zealous
and
hardworking
member
of
his
church
he
was
not
content
with
perfunctory
attendances
at
the
services
he
became
a
deacon
and
a
large
portion
of
his
leisure
time
was
devoted
to
the
work
which
thus
devolved
on
him
his
duties
were
to
collect
alms
and
to
distribute
to
the
destitute
and
nothing
was
permitted
to
interfere
with
their
exact
performance
he
was
exceedingly
charitable
himself
one
tenth
of
his
income
was
laid
aside
for
the
church
and
he
gave
freely
to
all
causes
of
benevolence
and
public
enterprise
at
the
church
meetings
whether
for
business
or
prayer
he
was
a
regular
attendant
and
between
himself
and
his
pastor
existed
the
most
confidential
relations
nor
did
he
consider
that
this
was
all
that
was
demanded
of
him
in
lexington
as
in
other
southern
towns
there
were
many
poor
negroes
and
the
condition
of
these
ignorant
and
helpless
creatures
especially
of
the
children
excited
his
compassion
out
of
his
own
means
he
established
a
sunday
school
in
which
he
and
his
wife
were
the
principal
teachers
his
friends
were
asked
to
send
their
slaves
and
the
experiment
was
successful
the
benches
were
always
crowded
and
the
rows
of
black
faces
were
a
source
of
as
much
pride
to
him
as
the
martial
appearance
of
the
cadet
battalion
jackson
religion
entered
into
every
action
of
his
life
no
duty
however
trivial
was
begun
without
asking
a
blessing
or
ended
without
returning
thanks
he
had
long
cultivated
he
said
the
habit
of
connecting
the
most
trivial
and
customary
acts
of
life
with
a
silent
prayer
he
took
the
bible
as
his
guide
and
it
is
possible
that
his
literal
interpretation
of
its
precepts
caused
many
to
regard
him
as
a
fanatic
his
observance
of
the
sabbath
was
hardly
in
accordance
with
ordinary
usage
he
never
read
a
letter
on
that
day
nor
posted
one
he
believed
that
the
government
in
carrying
the
mails
were
violating
a
divine
law
and
he
considered
the
suppression
of
such
traffic
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
the
legislature
such
opinions
were
uncommon
even
amongst
the
presbyterians
and
his
rigid
respect
for
truth
served
to
strengthen
the
impression
that
he
was
morbidly
scrupulous
if
he
unintentionally
made
a
misstatement
even
about
some
trifling
matter
as
soon
as
he
discovered
his
mistake
he
would
lose
no
time
and
spare
no
trouble
in
hastening
to
correct
it
why
in
the
name
of
reason
he
was
asked
do
you
walk
a
mile
in
the
rain
for
a
perfectly
unimportant
thing
simply
because
i
have
discovered
that
it
was
a
misstatement
and
i
could
not
sleep
comfortably
unless
i
put
it
right
he
had
occasion
to
censure
a
cadet
who
had
given
as
jackson
believed
the
wrong
solution
of
a
problem
on
thinking
the
matter
over
at
home
he
found
that
the
pupil
was
right
and
the
teacher
wrong
it
was
late
at
night
and
in
the
depth
of
winter
but
he
immediately
started
off
to
the
institute
some
distance
from
his
quarters
and
sent
for
the
cadet
the
delinquent
answering
with
much
trepidation
the
untimely
summons
found
himself
to
his
astonishment
the
recipient
of
a
frank
apology
jackson
scruples
carried
him
even
further
persons
who
interlarded
their
conversation
with
the
unmeaning
phrase
you
know
were
often
astonished
by
the
blunt
interruption
that
he
did
not
know
and
when
he
was
entreated
at
parties
or
receptions
to
break
through
his
dietary
rules
and
for
courtesy
sake
to
accept
some
delicacy
he
would
always
refuse
with
the
reply
that
he
had
no
genius
for
seeming
but
if
he
carried
his
conscientiousness
to
extremes
if
he
laid
down
stringent
rules
for
his
own
governance
he
neither
set
himself
up
for
a
model
nor
did
he
attempt
to
force
his
convictions
upon
others
he
was
always
tolerant
he
knew
his
own
faults
and
his
own
temptations
and
if
he
could
say
nothing
good
of
a
man
he
would
not
speak
of
him
at
all
but
he
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
overlook
conduct
of
which
he
disapproved
and
undue
leniency
was
a
weakness
to
which
he
never
yielded
if
he
once
lost
confidence
or
discovered
deception
on
the
part
of
one
he
trusted
he
withdrew
himself
as
far
as
possible
from
any
further
dealings
with
him
and
whether
with
the
cadets
or
with
his
if
an
offence
had
been
committed
of
which
he
was
called
upon
to
take
notice
he
was
absolutely
inflexible
punishment
or
report
inevitably
followed
no
excuses
no
personal
feelings
no
appeals
to
the
suffering
which
might
be
brought
upon
the
innocent
were
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
execution
of
his
duty
such
were
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
great
confederate
as
he
appeared
to
the
little
world
of
lexington
the
tall
figure
clad
in
the
blue
uniform
of
the
united
states
army
always
scrupulously
neat
striding
to
and
from
the
institute
or
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
while
the
cadet
battalion
wheeled
and
deployed
at
his
command
was
familiar
to
the
whole
community
but
jackson
heart
was
not
worn
on
his
sleeve
shy
and
silent
as
he
was
the
knowledge
that
even
his
closest
acquaintances
had
of
him
was
hardly
more
than
superficial
a
man
who
was
always
chary
of
expressing
his
opinions
unless
they
were
asked
for
who
declined
argument
and
used
as
few
words
as
possible
attracted
but
little
notice
a
few
recognised
his
clear
good
sense
the
majority
considered
that
if
he
said
little
it
was
because
he
had
nothing
worth
saying
because
he
went
his
own
way
and
lived
by
his
own
rules
he
was
considered
eccentric
because
he
was
sometimes
and
apt
to
become
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
was
set
down
as
unpractical
his
literal
accuracy
of
statement
was
construed
as
the
mark
of
a
narrow
intellect
and
his
exceeding
modesty
served
to
keep
him
in
the
background
at
the
institute
despite
his
reputation
for
courage
he
was
no
favourite
even
with
the
cadets
he
was
hardly
in
sympathy
with
them
his
temper
was
always
equable
whatever
he
may
have
felt
he
never
betrayed
irritation
and
in
the
or
elsewhere
he
was
kindness
itself
but
his
own
life
had
been
filled
from
boyhood
with
earnest
purpose
and
high
ambition
hard
work
was
more
to
his
taste
than
amusement
time
to
his
mind
was
far
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
and
he
made
few
allowances
for
the
thoughtlessness
and
indolence
of
irresponsible
youth
as
a
relief
possibly
to
the
educational
treadmill
his
class
delighted
in
listening
to
the
story
of
contreras
and
chapultepec
but
there
was
nothing
about
jackson
which
corresponded
with
a
boy
idea
of
a
hero
his
aggressive
punctuality
his
strict
observance
of
military
etiquette
his
precise
interpretation
of
orders
seemed
to
have
as
little
in
common
with
the
fierce
excitement
of
battle
as
the
uninteresting
occupations
of
the
presbyterian
deacon
who
kept
a
sunday
school
for
negroes
had
with
the
reckless
gaiety
of
the
traditional
sabreur
and
yet
says
one
who
know
him
they
imbibed
the
principles
he
taught
slowly
and
certainly
were
they
trained
in
the
direction
which
the
teacher
wished
jackson
justly
believed
that
the
chief
value
of
the
institute
consisted
in
the
habits
of
system
and
obedience
which
it
impressed
on
the
ductile
characters
of
the
cadets
and
regarded
any
relaxation
of
the
rules
as
tending
to
destroy
its
usefulness
his
conscientiousness
seemed
absurd
to
the
young
gentlemen
who
had
no
idea
of
the
importance
of
military
orders
or
of
the
implicit
obedience
which
a
good
soldier
deems
it
his
duty
to
pay
to
them
but
which
was
right
the
laughing
young
cadet
or
the
grave
major
of
artillery
let
the
thousands
who
in
the
bitter
and
arduous
struggle
of
the
civil
war
were
taught
by
stern
experience
the
necessity
of
strict
compliance
with
all
orders
to
the
very
letter
answer
the
question
cooke
page
as
exact
as
the
multiplication
table
and
as
full
of
things
military
as
an
arsenal
was
the
verdict
passed
on
jackson
by
one
of
his
townsmen
and
it
appears
to
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
community
at
large
jackson
indeed
was
as
inarticulate
as
cromwell
like
the
great
protector
he
lived
silent
and
like
him
he
was
often
misunderstood
stories
which
have
been
repeated
by
writer
after
writer
attribute
to
him
the
most
grotesque
eccentricities
of
manner
and
exhibit
his
lofty
piety
as
the
harsh
intolerance
of
a
fanatic
he
has
been
represented
as
the
narrowest
of
calvinists
and
so
general
was
the
belief
in
his
stern
and
merciless
nature
that
a
great
poet
did
not
scruple
to
link
his
name
with
a
deed
which
had
it
actually
occurred
would
have
been
one
of
almost
unexampled
cruelty
such
calumnies
as
whittier
barbara
frichtie
may
possibly
have
found
their
source
in
the
impression
made
upon
some
of
jackson
acquaintances
at
lexington
who
out
of
all
sympathy
with
his
high
ideal
of
life
and
duty
regarded
him
as
morose
and
morbid
and
when
in
after
years
the
fierce
and
relentless
pursuit
of
the
confederate
general
piled
the
dead
high
upon
the
this
conception
of
his
character
was
readily
accepted
as
he
rose
to
fame
men
listened
greedily
to
those
who
could
speak
of
him
from
personal
knowledge
the
anecdotes
which
they
related
were
quickly
distorted
the
slightest
peculiarities
of
walk
speech
or
gesture
were
greatly
exaggerated
and
even
virginians
seemed
to
vie
with
one
another
in
representing
the
humble
and
soldier
as
the
most
bigoted
of
christians
and
the
most
pitiless
of
men
but
just
as
the
majority
of
ridiculous
stories
which
cluster
round
his
name
rest
on
the
very
flimsiest
foundation
so
the
popular
conception
of
his
character
during
his
life
at
lexington
was
absolutely
erroneous
it
was
only
within
the
portals
of
his
home
that
his
real
nature
disclosed
itself
the
simple
and
pathetic
pages
in
which
his
widow
has
recorded
the
story
of
their
married
life
unfold
an
almost
ideal
picture
of
domestic
happiness
unchequered
by
the
faintest
glimpse
of
austerity
or
gloom
that
quiet
home
was
the
abode
of
much
content
the
sunshine
of
sweet
temper
flooded
every
nook
and
corner
and
although
the
pervading
atmosphere
was
essentially
religious
mirth
and
laughter
were
familiar
guests
those
who
knew
general
jackson
only
as
they
saw
him
in
public
would
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
there
could
be
such
a
transformation
as
he
exhibited
in
his
domestic
life
he
luxuriated
in
the
freedom
and
liberty
of
his
home
and
his
buoyancy
and
joyousness
often
ran
into
a
playfulness
and
abandon
that
would
have
been
incredible
to
those
who
saw
him
only
when
he
put
on
his
official
dignity
memoirs
of
stonewall
jackson
page
it
was
seldom
indeed
except
under
his
own
roof
or
in
the
company
of
his
intimates
that
his
reserve
was
broken
through
in
society
he
was
always
on
his
guard
fearful
lest
any
chance
word
might
be
misconstrued
or
give
offence
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
lexington
misjudged
him
nor
were
those
who
knew
him
only
when
he
was
absorbed
in
the
cares
of
command
before
the
enemy
likely
to
see
far
below
the
surface
the
dominant
trait
in
jackson
character
was
his
intense
earnestness
and
when
work
was
doing
every
faculty
of
his
nature
was
engrossed
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
task
on
hand
but
precise
methodical
and
as
he
appeared
his
was
no
commonplace
and
prosaic
nature
he
had
the
delicacy
and
the
tenderness
which
are
the
rarest
and
most
beautiful
ornament
of
the
strong
marion
crawford
beneath
his
habitual
gravity
a
vivid
imagination
restrained
indeed
by
strong
sense
and
indulging
in
no
vain
visions
was
ever
at
work
and
a
lofty
enthusiasm
which
seldom
betrayed
itself
in
words
inspired
his
whole
being
he
was
essentially
chivalrous
his
deference
to
woman
even
in
a
land
where
such
deference
was
still
the
fashion
was
remarkable
and
his
sympathy
with
the
oppressed
was
as
deep
as
his
loyalty
to
virginia
he
was
an
ardent
lover
of
nature
the
autumnal
glories
of
the
forest
the
songs
of
the
birds
the
splendours
of
the
sunset
were
sources
of
unfailing
pleasure
more
than
all
the
strength
of
his
imagination
carried
him
further
than
the
confines
of
the
material
world
and
he
saw
with
unclouded
vision
the
radiant
heights
that
lie
beyond
jackson
then
was
something
more
than
a
man
of
virile
temperament
he
was
gifted
with
other
qualities
than
energy
determination
and
common
sense
he
was
not
witty
he
had
no
talent
for
repartee
and
the
most
industrious
collector
of
anecdotes
will
find
few
good
things
attributed
to
him
but
he
possessed
a
kindly
humour
which
found
vent
in
playful
expressions
of
endearment
or
in
practical
jokes
of
the
most
innocent
description
and
if
these
outbursts
of
high
spirits
were
confined
to
the
precincts
of
his
own
home
they
proved
at
least
that
neither
by
temperament
nor
principle
was
he
inclined
to
look
upon
the
darker
side
his
eye
for
a
ludicrous
situation
was
very
quick
and
a
joke
which
told
against
himself
always
caused
him
the
most
intense
amusement
it
is
impossible
to
read
the
letters
which
jackson
has
published
and
to
entertain
the
belief
that
his
temper
was
ever
in
the
least
degree
morose
to
use
her
own
words
they
are
the
overflow
of
a
heart
full
of
tenderness
it
is
true
that
they
seldom
omit
some
reference
to
that
higher
life
which
both
husband
and
wife
were
striving
hand
in
hand
to
lead
but
they
are
instinct
from
first
to
last
with
the
serene
happiness
of
a
contented
mind
even
more
marked
than
his
habitual
cheerfulness
was
his
almost
feminine
sympathy
with
the
poor
and
feeble
his
servants
as
was
the
universal
rule
in
virginia
were
his
slaves
but
his
relations
with
his
black
dependents
were
of
almost
a
paternal
character
and
his
kindness
was
repaid
by
that
childlike
devotion
peculiar
to
the
negro
race
more
than
one
of
these
servants
so
great
was
his
reputation
for
kindness
had
begged
him
to
buy
them
from
their
former
owners
their
interests
were
his
special
care
in
sickness
they
received
all
the
attention
and
comfort
that
the
house
afforded
to
his
favourite
virtues
politeness
and
punctuality
they
were
trained
by
their
master
himself
and
their
moral
education
was
a
task
he
cheerfully
undertook
there
was
one
little
servant
in
the
family
says
jackson
whom
my
husband
took
under
his
sheltering
roof
at
the
solicitations
of
an
aged
lady
to
whom
the
child
became
a
care
after
having
been
left
an
orphan
she
was
not
bright
but
he
persevered
in
drilling
her
into
memorising
a
child
catechism
and
it
was
a
most
amusing
picture
to
see
her
standing
before
him
with
fixed
attention
as
if
she
were
straining
every
nerve
and
reciting
her
answers
with
the
drop
of
a
curtsey
at
each
word
she
had
not
been
taught
to
do
this
but
it
was
such
an
effort
for
her
to
learn
that
she
assumed
the
motion
involuntarily
jackson
home
was
childless
a
little
daughter
born
at
lexington
lived
only
for
a
few
weeks
and
her
place
remained
unfilled
his
sorrow
although
he
submitted
uncomplainingly
was
very
bitter
for
his
love
for
children
was
very
great
a
gentleman
says
jackson
who
spent
the
night
with
us
was
accompanied
by
his
daughter
but
four
years
of
age
it
was
the
first
time
the
child
had
been
separated
from
her
mother
and
my
husband
suggested
that
she
should
be
committed
to
my
care
during
the
night
but
she
clung
to
her
father
after
our
guests
had
both
sunk
in
slumber
the
father
was
aroused
by
someone
leaning
over
his
little
girl
and
drawing
the
covering
more
closely
round
her
it
was
only
his
thoughtful
host
who
felt
anxious
lest
his
little
guest
should
miss
her
mother
guardian
care
under
his
roof
and
could
not
go
to
sleep
himself
until
he
was
satisfied
that
all
was
well
with
the
child
these
incidents
are
little
more
than
trivial
the
attributes
they
reveal
seem
of
small
import
they
are
not
such
as
go
towards
building
up
a
successful
career
either
in
war
or
politics
and
yet
to
arrive
at
a
true
conception
of
jackson
character
it
is
necessary
that
such
incidents
should
be
recorded
that
character
will
not
appear
the
less
admirable
because
its
strength
and
energy
were
tempered
by
softer
virtues
and
when
we
remember
the
great
soldier
teaching
a
negro
child
or
ministering
to
the
comfort
of
a
sick
slave
it
becomes
easy
to
understand
the
feelings
with
which
his
veterans
regarded
him
the
quiet
home
at
lexington
reveals
more
of
the
real
man
than
the
camps
and
conflicts
of
the
civil
war
and
no
picture
of
stonewall
jackson
would
be
complete
without
some
reference
to
his
domestic
life
his
life
at
home
says
his
wife
was
perfectly
regular
and
systematic
he
arose
about
six
and
first
knelt
in
secret
prayer
then
he
took
a
cold
bath
which
was
never
omitted
even
in
the
coldest
days
of
winter
this
was
followed
by
a
brisk
walk
in
rain
or
shine
seven
was
the
hour
for
family
prayers
which
he
required
all
his
servants
to
attend
promptly
and
regularly
he
never
waited
for
anyone
not
even
his
wife
breakfast
followed
prayers
after
which
he
left
immediately
for
the
institute
his
classes
opening
at
eight
and
continuing
to
eleven
upon
his
return
home
at
eleven
he
devoted
himself
to
study
until
one
the
first
book
he
took
up
daily
was
his
bible
which
he
read
with
a
commentary
and
the
many
pencil
marks
upon
it
showed
with
what
care
he
bent
over
its
pages
from
his
bible
lesson
he
turned
to
his
during
those
hours
of
study
he
would
permit
no
interruption
and
stood
all
the
time
in
front
of
a
high
desk
after
dinner
he
gave
himself
up
for
half
an
hour
or
more
to
leisure
and
conversation
and
this
was
one
of
the
brightest
periods
in
his
home
life
he
then
went
into
his
garden
or
out
to
his
farm
to
superintend
his
servants
and
frequently
joined
them
in
manual
labour
he
would
often
drive
me
to
the
farm
and
find
a
shady
spot
for
me
under
the
trees
while
he
attended
to
the
work
of
the
field
when
this
was
not
the
case
he
always
returned
in
time
to
take
me
if
the
weather
permitted
for
an
evening
walk
or
drive
in
summer
we
often
took
our
drives
by
moonlight
and
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
virginia
the
queen
of
night
seemed
to
shine
with
more
brightness
than
elsewhere
when
at
home
he
would
indulge
himself
in
a
season
of
rest
and
recreation
after
supper
thinking
it
was
injurious
to
health
to
go
to
work
immediately
as
it
was
a
rule
with
him
never
to
use
his
eyes
by
artificial
light
he
formed
the
habit
of
studying
mentally
for
an
hour
or
so
without
a
book
after
going
over
his
lessons
in
the
morning
he
thus
reviewed
them
at
night
and
in
order
to
abstract
his
thoughts
from
surrounding
objects
a
habit
which
he
had
cultivated
to
a
remarkable
degree
he
would
if
alone
with
his
wife
ask
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
by
any
conversation
he
would
then
take
his
seat
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
remain
in
perfect
abstraction
until
he
finished
his
mental
task
he
was
very
fond
of
being
read
to
and
much
of
our
time
in
the
evening
was
passed
in
my
ministering
to
him
in
this
way
he
had
a
library
which
though
small
was
select
composed
chiefly
of
scientific
historical
and
religious
books
with
some
of
a
lighter
character
and
some
in
spanish
and
french
nearly
all
of
them
were
full
of
his
pencil
marks
made
with
a
view
to
future
reference
next
to
the
bible
history
both
ancient
and
modern
was
his
favourite
study
plutarch
josephus
rollin
robertson
hallam
macaulay
and
bancroft
were
his
constant
companions
shakespeare
held
an
honoured
place
upon
his
shelves
and
when
a
novel
fell
into
his
hands
he
became
so
absorbed
in
the
story
that
he
eventually
avoided
such
literature
as
a
waste
of
time
i
am
anxious
he
wrote
to
a
relative
to
devote
myself
to
study
until
i
shall
become
master
of
my
profession
the
jacksons
were
far
from
affluent
the
professor
had
nothing
but
his
salary
and
his
wife
one
of
a
large
family
brought
no
increase
to
their
income
but
the
traditional
hospitality
of
virginia
was
a
virtue
by
no
means
neglected
he
was
generous
but
unostentatious
in
his
mode
of
living
and
nothing
gave
him
more
pleasure
than
to
bid
his
friends
welcome
to
his
own
home
his
outdoor
recreations
were
healthful
but
not
exciting
the
hills
round
lexington
teemed
with
game
the
rivers
with
fish
and
shooting
and
fishing
were
the
favourite
amusements
of
his
colleagues
but
jackson
found
no
pleasure
in
rod
or
gun
and
although
fond
of
riding
and
a
good
horseman
he
never
appears
to
have
joined
in
any
of
those
equestrian
sports
to
which
the
virginians
were
much
addicted
he
neither
followed
the
hunt
nor
tilted
at
the
ring
his
exercise
was
taken
after
more
utilitarian
fashion
in
the
garden
or
the
farm
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
such
a
lover
of
order
and
method
was
strictly
economical
and
the
wise
administration
of
the
farm
and
household
permitted
an
annual
expenditure
on
travel
many
of
the
most
beautiful
localities
and
famous
cities
of
the
east
and
north
were
visited
in
these
excursions
sometimes
he
wandered
with
his
wife
in
search
of
health
more
often
the
object
of
their
journey
was
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
the
splendid
scenery
of
their
native
land
the
associations
which
were
ever
connected
in
jackson
mind
with
his
tour
through
europe
show
how
intensely
he
appreciated
the
marvels
both
of
nature
and
of
art
i
would
advise
you
he
wrote
to
a
friend
never
to
name
my
european
trip
to
me
unless
you
are
blest
with
a
superabundance
of
patience
as
its
very
mention
is
calculated
to
bring
up
with
it
an
almost
inexhaustible
assemblage
of
grand
and
beautiful
associations
passing
over
the
works
of
the
creator
which
are
far
the
most
impressive
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
the
influences
which
even
the
works
of
his
creatures
exercise
over
the
mind
of
one
who
lingers
amidst
their
master
productions
well
do
i
remember
the
influence
of
sculpture
upon
me
during
my
short
stay
in
florence
and
how
there
i
began
to
realise
the
sentiment
of
the
florentine
take
from
me
my
liberty
take
what
you
will
but
leave
me
my
statuary
leave
me
these
entrancing
productions
of
art
and
similar
to
this
is
the
influence
of
painting
but
delightful
as
were
these
holiday
expeditions
the
day
of
jackson
return
to
lexington
and
his
duties
never
came
too
soon
in
the
quiet
routine
of
his
home
life
in
his
work
at
the
institute
in
the
supervision
of
his
farm
and
garden
in
his
evenings
with
his
books
and
in
the
services
of
his
church
he
was
more
than
contented
whatever
remained
of
soldierly
ambition
had
long
been
eradicated
man
of
action
as
he
essentially
was
he
evinced
no
longing
for
a
wider
sphere
of
intellectual
activity
or
for
a
more
active
existence
under
his
own
he
found
all
that
he
desired
there
says
his
wife
all
that
was
best
in
his
nature
shone
forth
and
that
temper
was
surely
of
the
sweetest
which
could
utter
no
sterner
rebuke
than
ah
that
is
not
the
way
to
be
happy
nor
was
it
merely
his
own
gentleness
of
disposition
and
the
many
graces
of
his
charming
helpmate
that
secured
so
large
a
degree
of
peace
and
happiness
jackson
religion
played
even
a
greater
part
it
was
not
of
the
kind
which
is
more
concerned
with
the
terrors
of
hell
than
the
glories
of
paradise
the
world
to
him
was
no
place
of
woe
and
lamentation
its
beauties
vanity
and
its
affections
a
snare
as
he
gazed
with
delight
on
the
gorgeous
tints
of
the
autumnal
forests
and
the
lovely
landscapes
of
his
mountain
home
so
he
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
the
life
and
love
which
had
fallen
to
his
lot
and
thanked
god
for
that
capacity
for
happiness
with
which
his
nature
was
so
largely
gifted
yet
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
practised
no
his
life
in
many
respects
was
one
of
constant
and
when
his
time
came
to
sacrifice
himself
he
submitted
without
a
murmur
but
in
his
creed
fear
had
no
place
his
faith
was
great
it
was
not
however
a
mere
belief
in
omnipotence
and
god
justice
but
a
deep
and
abiding
confidence
in
his
infinite
compassion
and
infinite
love
and
it
created
in
him
an
almost
startling
consciousness
of
the
nearness
and
reality
of
the
invisible
world
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
it
is
revealed
in
all
its
strength
you
must
not
be
discouraged
at
the
slowness
of
recovery
look
up
to
him
who
giveth
liberally
for
faith
to
be
resigned
to
his
divine
will
and
trust
him
for
that
measure
of
health
which
will
most
glorify
him
and
advance
to
the
greatest
extent
your
own
real
happiness
we
are
sometimes
suffered
to
be
in
a
state
of
perplexity
that
our
faith
may
be
tried
and
grow
stronger
see
if
you
can
not
spend
a
short
time
after
dark
in
looking
out
of
your
window
into
space
and
meditating
upon
heaven
with
all
its
joys
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
god
children
try
to
look
up
and
be
cheerful
and
not
desponding
trust
our
kind
heavenly
father
and
by
the
eye
of
faith
see
that
all
things
are
right
and
for
your
best
interests
the
clouds
come
pass
over
us
and
are
followed
by
bright
sunshine
so
in
god
moral
dealings
with
us
he
permits
to
have
trouble
awhile
but
let
us
even
in
the
most
trying
dispensations
of
his
providence
be
cheered
by
the
brightness
which
is
a
little
ahead
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
discuss
jackson
views
on
controversial
questions
it
may
be
well
however
to
correct
a
common
error
it
has
been
asserted
that
he
was
a
fatalist
and
therefore
careless
of
a
future
over
which
he
believed
he
had
no
control
not
a
word
however
either
in
his
letters
or
in
his
recorded
conversations
warrants
the
assumption
it
is
true
that
his
favourite
maxim
was
duty
is
ours
consequences
are
god
and
that
knowing
all
things
work
together
for
good
he
looked
forward
to
the
future
without
misgiving
or
apprehension
but
none
the
less
he
believed
implicitly
that
the
destiny
of
men
and
of
nations
is
in
their
own
hands
his
faith
was
as
sane
as
it
was
humble
without
a
touch
of
that
presumptuous
fanaticism
which
stains
the
memory
of
cromwell
to
whom
he
has
been
so
often
compared
he
never
imagined
even
at
the
height
of
his
renown
when
victory
on
victory
crowned
his
banners
that
he
was
the
scourge
of
god
the
chosen
instrument
of
his
vengeance
he
prayed
without
ceasing
under
fire
as
in
the
camp
but
he
never
mistook
his
own
impulse
for
a
revelation
of
the
divine
will
he
prayed
for
help
to
do
his
duty
and
he
prayed
for
success
he
knew
that
more
things
are
wrought
by
prayer
than
this
world
dreams
of
but
he
knew
also
that
prayer
is
not
always
answered
in
the
way
which
man
would
have
it
he
went
into
battle
with
supreme
confidence
not
as
has
been
alleged
that
the
lord
had
delivered
the
enemy
into
his
hands
but
that
whatever
happened
would
be
the
best
that
could
happen
and
he
was
as
free
from
cant
as
from
it
may
be
said
of
jackson
as
has
been
said
so
eloquently
of
the
men
whom
in
some
respects
he
closely
resembled
that
his
bible
was
literally
food
to
his
understanding
and
a
guide
to
his
conduct
he
saw
the
visible
finger
of
god
in
every
incident
of
life
that
which
in
our
day
devout
men
and
women
feel
in
their
earnest
moments
of
prayer
the
devout
puritan
felt
as
a
second
nature
in
his
rising
up
and
in
his
lying
down
in
the
and
in
the
home
in
society
and
in
business
in
parliament
in
council
and
on
the
field
of
battle
and
feeling
this
the
puritan
had
no
shame
in
uttering
the
very
words
of
the
bible
wherein
he
had
learned
so
to
feel
nay
he
would
have
burned
with
shame
had
he
faltered
in
using
the
words
it
is
very
hard
for
us
now
to
grasp
what
this
implies
but
there
was
a
generation
in
which
this
phraseology
was
the
natural
speech
of
men
oliver
cromwell
by
frederic
harrison
page
of
this
generation
although
later
in
time
was
stonewall
jackson
to
him
such
language
as
he
used
in
his
letters
to
his
wife
in
conversation
with
his
intimates
and
not
rarely
in
his
official
correspondence
was
the
literal
assertion
of
truths
which
he
felt
to
the
roots
of
his
being
which
absorbed
his
thoughts
which
coloured
every
action
of
his
life
and
which
from
the
abundance
of
his
heart
rose
most
naturally
to
his
lips
there
is
no
need
for
further
allusion
to
his
domestic
or
religious
life
if
in
general
society
jackson
was
wanting
in
geniality
if
he
was
so
little
a
man
of
the
world
that
his
example
lost
much
of
the
influence
which
had
he
stood
less
aloof
from
others
it
must
have
exercised
it
was
the
fruit
of
his
early
training
his
natural
reserve
and
his
extreme
humility
it
is
impossible
however
that
so
pure
a
life
should
have
been
altogether
without
reflex
upon
others
if
the
cadets
profited
but
indirectly
the
slaves
had
cause
to
bless
his
practical
christianity
the
poor
and
the
widow
knew
him
as
a
friend
and
his
neighbours
looked
up
to
him
as
the
soul
of
sincerity
the
enemy
of
all
that
was
false
and
vile
and
for
himself
what
share
had
those
years
of
quiet
study
of
and
of
in
shaping
the
triumphs
of
the
confederate
arms
the
story
of
his
military
career
is
the
reply
men
of
action
have
before
now
deplored
the
incessant
press
of
business
which
leaves
them
no
leisure
to
think
out
the
problems
which
may
confront
them
in
the
future
experience
is
of
little
value
without
reflection
and
leisure
has
its
disadvantages
one
can
comprehend
says
dabney
referring
to
jackson
peculiar
form
of
mental
exercise
how
valuable
was
the
training
which
his
mind
received
for
his
work
as
a
soldier
command
over
his
attention
was
formed
into
a
habit
which
no
tempest
of
confusion
could
disturb
his
power
of
abstraction
became
unrivalled
his
imagination
was
trained
and
invigorated
until
it
became
capable
of
grouping
the
most
extensive
and
complex
considerations
the
power
of
his
mind
was
drilled
like
the
strength
of
an
athlete
and
his
became
unsurpassed
such
training
was
undoubtedly
the
very
best
foundation
for
the
intellectual
side
of
a
general
business
war
presents
a
constant
succession
of
problems
to
be
solved
by
mental
processes
for
some
experience
and
resource
supply
a
ready
solution
others
involving
the
movements
of
large
bodies
considerations
of
time
and
space
and
the
thousand
and
one
circumstances
such
as
food
weather
roads
topography
and
morale
which
a
general
must
always
bear
in
mind
are
composed
of
so
many
factors
that
only
a
brain
accustomed
to
hard
thinking
can
deal
with
them
successfully
of
this
nature
are
the
problems
of
strategy
those
which
confront
a
general
in
command
of
an
army
or
of
a
detached
portion
of
an
army
and
which
are
worked
out
on
the
map
the
problems
of
the
are
of
a
different
order
the
natural
characteristics
which
when
fortified
by
experience
carry
men
through
any
dangerous
enterprise
win
the
majority
of
victories
but
men
may
win
battles
and
be
very
poor
generals
they
may
be
born
leaders
of
men
and
yet
absolutely
unfitted
for
independent
command
their
courage
coolness
and
common
sense
may
accomplish
the
enemy
overthrow
on
the
field
but
with
strategical
considerations
their
intellects
may
be
absolutely
incapable
of
grappling
in
the
great
wars
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
ney
and
blucher
were
probably
the
best
fighting
generals
of
france
and
prussia
but
neither
could
be
trusted
to
conduct
a
campaign
blucher
on
the
knew
nothing
of
the
grand
combinations
which
prepare
and
complete
success
if
he
was
the
strong
right
hand
of
the
prussian
army
his
chief
of
staff
was
the
brain
gneisenau
said
the
old
marshal

administer
ney
best
qualities
says
jomini
who
served
long
on
his
staff
his
heroic
valour
his
quick
coup
and
his
energy
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
extent
of
his
command
increased
his
responsibility
admirable
on
the
field
of
battle
he
displayed
less
assurance
not
only
in
council
but
whenever
he
was
not
actually
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
it
is
not
of
such
material
as
ney
and
blucher
mistrustful
of
their
own
ability
that
great
captains
are
made
marked
intellectual
capacity
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
most
famous
soldiers
alexander
hannibal
caesar
marlborough
washington
frederick
napoleon
wellington
and
nelson
were
each
and
all
of
them
something
more
than
mere
fighting
men
few
of
their
age
rivalled
them
in
strength
of
intellect
it
was
this
combined
with
the
best
qualities
of
ney
and
blucher
that
made
them
masters
of
strategy
and
lifted
them
high
above
those
who
were
tacticians
and
nothing
more
and
it
was
strength
of
intellect
that
jackson
cultivated
at
lexington
so
in
that
quiet
home
amidst
the
virginian
mountains
the
years
sped
by
peaceful
and
uneventful
varied
only
by
the
holiday
excursions
of
successive
summers
by
day
the
lecture
at
the
institute
the
drill
of
the
cadet
battery
the
work
of
the
church
the
pleasant
toil
of
the
farm
and
garden
when
night
fell
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
across
the
windows
that
looked
upon
the
quiet
street
there
in
that
home
where
order
reigned
supreme
where
as
the
master
wished
each
door
turned
softly
on
a
golden
hinge
came
those
hours
of
thought
and
analysis
which
were
to
fit
him
for
great
deeds
the
even
tenor
of
this
calm
existence
was
broken
however
by
an
incident
which
intensified
the
bitter
feeling
which
already
divided
the
northern
and
southern
sections
of
the
united
states
during
the
month
of
january
jackson
had
marched
with
the
cadet
battalion
to
harper
ferry
where
on
the
northern
frontier
of
virginia
the
fanatic
john
brown
had
attempted
to
raise
an
insurrection
amongst
the
negroes
and
had
been
hung
after
trial
in
presence
of
the
troops
by
the
south
brown
was
regarded
as
a
madman
and
a
murderer
by
many
in
the
north
he
was
glorified
as
a
martyr
and
so
acute
was
the
tension
that
early
in
during
a
short
absence
from
lexington
jackson
wrote
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
what
do
you
think
about
the
state
of
the
country
viewing
things
at
washington
from
human
appearances
i
think
we
have
great
reason
for
alarm
a
great
crisis
was
indeed
at
hand
but
if
to
her
who
was
ever
beside
him
while
the
storm
clouds
were
rising
dark
and
terrible
over
the
fair
skies
of
the
prosperous
republic
the
christian
soldier
seemed
the
man
best
fitted
to
lead
the
people
it
was
not
so
outside
none
doubted
his
sincerity
or
questioned
his
resolution
but
few
had
penetrated
his
reserve
as
the
playful
tenderness
he
displayed
at
home
was
never
suspected
so
the
consuming
earnestness
the
absolute
fearlessness
whether
of
danger
or
of
responsibility
the
utter
disregard
of
man
and
the
unquestioning
faith
in
the
almighty
which
made
up
the
individuality
which
men
called
stonewall
jackson
remained
hidden
from
all
but
one
to
his
wife
his
inward
graces
idealised
his
outward
seeming
but
others
noting
his
peculiarities
and
deceived
by
his
modesty
saw
little
that
was
remarkable
and
much
that
was
singular
in
the
staid
professor
few
detected
beneath
that
quiet
demeanour
and
absent
manner
the
existence
of
energy
incarnate
and
an
iron
will
and
still
fewer
beheld
in
the
plain
figure
of
the
presbyterian
deacon
the
potential
leader
of
great
armies
inspiring
the
devotion
of
his
soldiers
and
riding
in
the
forefront
of
victorious
battle
chapter
secession
to
jackson
spent
ten
years
at
lexington
and
he
was
just
when
he
left
it
for
ten
years
he
had
seen
no
more
of
military
service
than
the
drills
of
the
cadet
battalion
he
had
lost
all
touch
with
the
army
his
name
had
been
forgotten
except
by
his
comrades
of
the
mexican
campaign
and
he
had
hardly
seen
a
regular
soldier
since
he
resigned
his
commission
but
even
from
a
military
point
of
view
those
ten
years
had
not
been
wasted
his
mind
had
a
wider
grasp
and
his
brain
was
more
active
striving
to
fit
himself
for
such
duties
as
might
devolve
on
him
should
he
be
summoned
to
the
field
like
all
great
men
and
all
practical
men
he
had
gone
to
the
best
masters
in
the
campaigns
of
napoleon
he
had
found
instruction
in
the
highest
branch
of
his
profession
and
had
made
his
own
the
methods
of
war
which
the
greatest
of
modern
soldiers
both
preached
and
practised
maturer
years
and
the
search
for
wisdom
had
steadied
his
restless
daring
and
his
devotion
to
duty
always
remarkable
had
become
a
second
nature
his
health
under
careful
and
treatment
had
much
improved
and
the
year
found
him
in
the
prime
of
physical
and
mental
vigour
already
it
had
become
apparent
that
his
life
at
lexington
was
soon
to
end
the
damascus
blade
was
not
to
rust
upon
the
shelf
during
the
winter
of
the
probability
of
a
conflict
between
the
free
and
states
that
is
between
north
and
south
had
become
almost
a
certainty
south
carolina
mississippi
alabama
florida
georgia
louisiana
and
texas
had
formally
seceded
from
the
union
and
establishing
a
provisional
government
with
jefferson
davis
as
president
at
montgomery
in
alabama
had
proclaimed
a
new
republic
under
the
title
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
in
order
to
explain
jackson
attitude
at
this
momentous
crisis
it
will
be
necessary
to
discuss
the
action
of
virginia
and
to
investigate
the
motives
which
led
her
to
take
the
side
she
did
forces
which
it
was
impossible
to
curb
and
which
but
few
detected
were
at
the
root
of
the
secession
movement
the
ostensible
cause
was
the
future
status
of
the
negro
slavery
was
recognised
in
fifteen
states
of
the
union
in
the
north
it
had
long
been
abolished
but
this
made
no
difference
to
its
existence
in
the
south
the
states
which
composed
the
union
were
communities
with
their
own
legislatures
their
own
magistracies
their
own
militia
and
the
power
of
the
purse
how
far
their
sovereign
rights
extended
was
a
matter
of
contention
but
under
the
terms
of
the
constitution
slavery
was
a
domestic
institution
which
each
individual
state
was
at
liberty
to
retain
or
discard
at
will
and
over
which
the
federal
government
had
no
control
whatever
congress
would
have
been
no
more
justified
in
declaring
that
the
slaves
in
virginia
were
free
men
than
in
demanding
that
russian
conspirators
should
be
tried
by
jury
nor
was
the
philanthropy
of
the
northern
people
generally
speaking
of
an
enthusiastic
nature
the
majority
regarded
slavery
as
a
necessary
evil
and
if
they
deplored
the
reproach
to
the
republic
they
made
little
parade
of
their
sentiments
a
large
number
of
southerners
believed
it
to
be
the
happiest
condition
for
the
african
race
but
the
best
men
especially
in
the
border
states
of
which
virginia
was
the
principal
would
have
welcomed
emancipation
but
neither
northerner
nor
southerner
saw
a
practicable
method
of
giving
freedom
to
the
negro
such
a
measure
if
carried
out
in
its
entirety
meant
ruin
to
the
south
cotton
and
tobacco
the
principal
and
most
lucrative
crops
required
an
immense
number
of
hands
and
in
those
hands
his
negro
slaves
the
capital
of
the
planter
was
locked
up
emancipation
would
have
swept
the
whole
of
this
capital
away
compensation
the
remedy
applied
by
england
to
jamaica
and
south
africa
was
hardly
to
be
thought
of
instead
of
twenty
millions
sterling
it
would
have
cost
four
hundred
millions
it
was
doubtful
too
if
compensation
would
have
staved
off
the
ruin
of
the
planters
the
labour
of
the
free
negro
naturally
indolent
and
improvident
was
well
known
to
be
most
inefficient
as
compared
with
that
of
the
slave
for
some
years
to
say
the
least
after
emancipation
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
work
the
plantations
except
at
a
heavy
loss
moreover
abolition
in
the
judgment
of
all
who
knew
him
meant
ruin
to
the
negro
under
the
system
of
the
plantations
honesty
and
morality
were
being
gradually
instilled
into
the
coloured
race
but
these
virtues
had
as
yet
made
little
progress
the
christianity
of
the
slaves
was
but
and
if
all
restraint
were
removed
if
the
old
ties
were
broken
and
the
influence
of
the
planter
and
his
family
should
cease
to
operate
it
was
only
too
probable
that
the
four
millions
of
africans
would
relapse
into
the
barbaric
vices
of
their
original
condition
the
hideous
massacres
which
had
followed
emancipation
in
san
domingo
had
not
yet
been
forgotten
it
is
little
wonder
then
that
the
majority
shrank
before
a
problem
involving
such
tremendous
consequences
a
party
however
conspicuous
both
in
new
england
and
the
west
had
taken
abolition
for
its
watchword
small
in
numbers
but
vehement
in
denunciation
its
voice
was
heard
throughout
the
union
zeal
for
universal
liberty
rose
superior
to
the
constitution
that
instrument
was
repudiated
as
an
iniquitous
document
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
individual
states
were
indignantly
denied
slavery
was
denounced
as
the
sum
of
all
villainies
the
as
the
worst
of
tyrants
and
no
concealment
was
made
of
the
intention
should
political
power
be
secured
of
compelling
the
south
to
set
the
negroes
free
in
the
autumn
of
came
the
presidential
election
hitherto
of
the
two
great
political
parties
the
democrats
had
long
ruled
the
councils
of
the
nation
and
nearly
the
whole
south
was
democratic
the
south
as
regards
population
was
numerically
inferior
to
the
north
but
the
democratic
party
had
more
than
held
its
own
at
the
for
the
reason
that
it
had
many
adherents
in
the
north
so
long
as
the
southern
and
northern
democrats
held
together
they
far
outnumbered
the
republicans
in
however
the
two
sections
of
the
democratic
party
split
asunder
the
republicans
favoured
by
the
schism
carried
their
own
candidate
and
abraham
lincoln
became
president
south
carolina
at
once
seceded
and
the
confederacy
was
soon
afterwards
established
it
is
not
at
first
sight
apparent
why
a
change
of
government
should
have
caused
so
sudden
a
disruption
of
the
union
the
republican
party
however
embraced
sections
of
various
shades
of
thought
one
of
these
rising
every
day
to
greater
prominence
was
that
which
advocated
immediate
abolition
and
to
this
section
designated
by
the
south
as
black
republicans
the
new
president
was
believed
to
belong
it
is
possible
that
on
his
advent
to
office
the
political
leaders
of
the
south
despite
the
safeguards
of
the
constitution
saw
in
the
near
future
the
unconditional
emancipation
of
the
slaves
and
not
only
this
but
that
the
emancipated
slaves
would
receive
the
right
of
suffrage
and
be
placed
on
a
footing
of
complete
equality
with
their
former
masters
grant
memoirs
volume
page
as
in
many
districts
the
whites
were
far
outnumbered
by
the
negroes
this
was
tantamount
to
transferring
all
local
government
into
the
hands
of
the
latter
and
surrendering
the
planters
to
the
mercies
of
their
former
bondsmen
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
an
act
of
such
gross
injustice
was
never
contemplated
except
by
hysterical
abolitionists
and
those
who
truckled
for
their
votes
it
was
certainly
not
contemplated
by
lincoln
and
it
was
hardly
likely
that
a
president
who
had
been
elected
by
a
minority
of
the
people
would
dare
even
if
he
were
so
inclined
to
assume
unconstitutional
powers
the
democratic
party
taking
both
sections
together
was
still
the
stronger
and
the
northern
democrats
temporarily
severed
as
they
were
from
their
southern
brethren
would
most
assuredly
have
united
with
them
in
resisting
any
unconstitutional
action
on
the
part
of
the
republicans
if
then
it
might
be
asked
slavery
ran
no
risk
of
unconditional
abolition
why
should
the
southern
political
leaders
have
acted
with
such
extraordinary
precipitation
why
in
a
country
in
which
to
all
appearances
the
two
sections
had
been
cordially
united
should
the
advent
to
power
of
one
political
party
have
been
the
signal
for
so
much
disquietude
on
the
part
of
the
other
had
the
presidential
seat
been
suddenly
usurped
by
an
abolitionist
tyrant
of
the
type
of
robespierre
the
south
could
hardly
have
exhibited
greater
apprehension
few
americans
denied
that
a
permanent
union
such
as
had
been
designed
by
the
founders
of
the
republic
was
the
best
guarantee
of
prosperity
and
peace
and
yet
because
a
certain
number
of
misguided
if
men
clamoured
for
emancipation
the
south
chose
to
bring
down
in
ruin
the
splendid
fabric
which
their
forefathers
had
constructed
in
thus
refusing
to
trust
the
good
sense
and
fair
dealing
of
the
republicans
it
would
seem
at
a
superficial
glance
that
the
course
adopted
by
the
members
of
the
new
confederacy
whether
legitimate
or
not
could
not
possibly
be
justified
i
have
been
somewhat
severely
taken
to
task
for
attaching
the
epithets
misguided
unpractical
fanatical
to
the
abolitionists
i
see
no
reason
however
to
modify
my
language
it
is
too
often
the
case
that
men
of
the
loftiest
ideals
seek
to
attain
them
by
the
most
objectionable
means
and
the
maxim
fiat
justitia
ruat
coelum
can
not
be
literally
applied
to
great
affairs
the
conversion
of
the
mahomedan
world
to
christianity
would
be
a
nobler
work
than
even
the
emancipation
of
the
negro
but
the
missionary
who
began
with
reviling
the
faithful
and
then
proceeded
to
threaten
them
with
fire
and
the
sword
unless
they
changed
their
creed
would
justly
be
called
a
fanatic
yet
the
abolitionists
did
worse
than
this
for
they
incited
the
negroes
to
insurrection
nor
do
i
think
that
the
question
is
affected
by
the
fact
that
many
of
the
abolitionists
were
upright
earnest
and
devout
a
good
man
is
not
necessarily
a
wise
man
and
i
remember
that
samuel
johnson
and
john
wesley
supported
king
george
against
the
american
colonists
unfortunately
something
more
than
mere
political
rancour
was
at
work
the
areas
of
slave
and
of
free
labour
were
divided
by
an
artificial
frontier
mason
and
dixon
line
originally
fixed
as
the
boundary
between
pennsylvania
on
the
north
and
virginia
and
maryland
on
the
south
cut
the
territory
of
the
united
states
into
two
distinct
sections
and
little
by
little
these
two
sections
geographically
as
well
as
politically
severed
had
resolved
themselves
into
what
might
almost
be
termed
two
distinct
nations
many
circumstances
tended
to
increase
the
cleavage
the
south
was
purely
agricultural
the
most
prosperous
part
of
the
north
was
purely
industrial
in
the
south
the
great
planters
formed
a
landed
aristocracy
the
claims
of
birth
were
ungrudgingly
admitted
class
barriers
were
to
a
certain
extent
a
recognised
part
of
the
social
system
and
the
sons
of
the
old
houses
were
accepted
as
the
natural
leaders
of
the
people
in
the
north
on
the
contrary
the
only
aristocracy
was
that
of
wealth
and
even
wealth
apart
from
merit
had
no
hold
on
the
respect
of
the
community
the
distinctions
of
caste
were
slight
in
the
extreme
the
descendants
of
the
puritans
of
those
english
country
gentlemen
who
had
preferred
to
ride
with
cromwell
rather
than
with
rupert
to
pray
with
baxter
rather
than
with
laud
made
no
parade
of
their
ancestry
and
among
the
extreme
republicans
existed
an
innate
but
decided
aversion
to
the
recognition
of
social
grades
moreover
divergent
interests
demanded
different
fiscal
treatment
the
cotton
and
tobacco
of
the
south
monopolising
the
markets
of
the
world
asked
for
free
trade
the
manufacturers
of
new
england
struggling
against
foreign
competition
were
strong
protectionists
and
they
were
powerful
enough
to
enforce
their
will
in
the
shape
of
an
oppressive
tariff
thus
the
planters
of
virginia
paid
high
prices
in
order
that
mills
might
flourish
in
connecticut
and
the
sovereign
states
of
the
south
to
their
own
detriment
were
compelled
to
contribute
to
the
abundance
of
the
wealthier
north
the
interests
of
labour
were
not
less
conflicting
the
competition
between
free
and
forced
labour
side
by
side
on
the
same
continent
was
bound
in
itself
sooner
or
later
to
breed
dissension
and
if
it
had
not
yet
reached
an
acute
stage
it
had
at
least
created
a
certain
degree
of
bitter
feeling
but
more
than
all
and
the
fact
must
be
borne
in
mind
if
the
character
of
the
civil
war
is
to
be
fully
appreciated
the
natural
ties
which
should
have
linked
together
the
states
on
either
side
of
mason
and
dixon
line
had
weakened
to
a
mere
mechanical
bond
the
intercourse
between
north
and
south
social
or
commercial
was
hardly
more
than
that
which
exists
between
two
foreign
nations
the
two
sections
knew
but
little
of
each
other
and
that
little
was
not
the
good
points
but
the
bad
for
more
than
fifty
years
after
the
election
of
the
first
president
while
as
yet
the
crust
of
european
tradition
overlaid
the
young
shoots
of
democracy
the
supremacy
social
and
political
of
the
great
landowners
of
the
south
had
been
practically
undisputed
but
when
the
young
republic
began
to
take
its
place
amongst
the
nations
men
found
that
the
wealth
and
talents
which
led
it
forward
belonged
as
much
to
the
busy
cities
of
new
england
as
to
the
plantations
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
and
with
the
growing
sentiment
in
favour
of
universal
equality
began
the
revolt
against
the
dominion
of
a
caste
those
who
had
carved
out
their
own
fortunes
by
sheer
hard
work
and
ability
questioned
the
superiority
of
men
whose
positions
were
no
guarantee
of
personal
capacity
and
whose
wealth
was
not
of
their
own
making
those
who
had
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
deemed
themselves
the
equals
and
more
than
equals
of
those
who
had
loitered
in
the
shade
and
esteeming
men
for
their
own
worth
and
not
for
that
of
some
forgotten
ancestor
they
had
come
to
despise
those
who
toiled
not
neither
did
they
spin
tenaciously
the
southerners
clung
to
the
supremacy
they
had
inherited
from
a
bygone
age
the
contempt
of
the
northerner
was
repaid
in
kind
in
the
political
arena
the
struggle
was
fierce
and
keen
mutual
hatred
fanned
by
unscrupulous
agitators
increased
in
bitterness
and
hindering
reconciliation
rose
the
fatal
barrier
of
slavery
it
is
true
that
prior
to
the
abolitionists
were
not
numerous
in
the
north
and
it
is
equally
true
that
by
many
of
the
best
men
in
the
south
the
institution
which
had
been
bequeathed
to
them
was
thoroughly
detested
looking
back
over
the
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
slaves
were
freed
the
errors
of
the
two
factions
are
sufficiently
manifest
if
on
the
one
hand
the
abolitionist
denouncing
sternly
in
season
and
out
of
season
the
existence
of
slavery
on
the
free
soil
of
america
was
unjust
and
worse
to
the
who
to
say
the
least
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
inhuman
and
shortsighted
policy
of
a
former
generation
on
the
other
hand
the
southerner
although
in
his
heart
deploring
the
condition
of
the
negro
and
sometimes
imitating
the
example
of
washington
whose
dying
bequest
gave
freedom
to
his
slaves
made
no
attempt
to
find
a
remedy
on
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
my
views
on
the
action
of
the
abolitionists
were
traversed
by
critics
whose
opinions
demand
consideration
they
implied
that
in
condemning
the
unwisdom
and
violence
of
the
party
i
had
not
taken
into
account
the
aggressive
tendencies
of
the
southern
politicians
from
onwards
that
i
had
ignored
the
attempts
to
extend
slavery
to
the
territories
and
that
i
had
overlooked
the
effect
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
a
close
study
of
abolitionist
literature
however
had
made
it
very
clear
to
me
that
the
advocates
of
emancipation
although
actuated
by
the
highest
motives
never
at
any
time
approached
the
question
in
a
conciliatory
spirit
and
that
long
before
their
fierce
cries
for
vengeance
had
roused
the
very
bitterest
feelings
in
the
south
in
fact
they
had
already
made
war
inevitable
draper
the
northern
historian
admits
that
so
early
as
the
contest
between
the
abolitionists
on
one
side
and
the
on
the
other
hand
had
become
a
mortal
duel
it
may
be
argued
perhaps
that
the
abolitionists
saw
that
the
would
never
yield
except
to
armed
force
and
that
they
therefore
showed
good
judgment
in
provoking
the
south
into
secession
and
civil
war
but
forcing
the
hand
of
the
almighty
is
something
more
than
a
questionable
doctrine
the
latter
had
the
better
excuse
he
knew
were
emancipation
granted
that
years
must
elapse
before
the
negro
could
be
trained
to
the
responsibilities
of
freedom
and
that
those
years
would
impoverish
the
south
it
appears
to
have
been
forgotten
by
the
abolitionists
that
all
races
upon
earth
have
required
a
protracted
probation
to
fit
them
for
the
rights
of
citizenship
and
the
duties
of
free
men
here
was
a
people
hardly
emerged
from
the
grossest
barbarism
and
possibly
from
the
very
beginning
of
inferior
natural
endowment
on
whom
they
proposed
to
confer
the
same
rights
without
any
probation
whatsoever
a
glance
at
the
world
around
them
should
have
induced
reflection
the
experience
of
other
countries
was
not
encouraging
hayti
where
the
blacks
had
long
been
masters
of
the
soil
was
still
a
pandemonium
and
in
jamaica
and
south
africa
the
precipitate
action
of
zealous
but
unpractical
philanthropists
had
wrought
incalculable
mischief
even
lincoln
himself
redemption
by
purchase
being
impracticable
saw
no
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
than
the
wholesale
deportation
of
the
negroes
to
west
africa
in
time
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
such
men
as
lincoln
and
lee
the
nation
might
have
found
a
solution
of
the
problem
and
north
and
south
have
combined
to
rid
their
common
country
of
the
curse
of
human
servitude
but
between
fanaticism
on
the
one
side
and
helplessness
on
the
other
there
was
no
common
ground
the
fierce
invectives
of
the
reformers
forbade
all
hope
of
temperate
discussion
and
their
unreasoning
denunciations
only
provoked
resentment
and
this
resentment
became
the
more
bitter
because
in
demanding
emancipation
either
by
fair
means
or
forcible
and
in
expressing
their
intention
of
making
it
a
national
question
the
abolitionists
were
directly
striking
at
a
right
which
the
people
of
the
south
held
sacred
it
had
never
been
questioned
hitherto
that
the
several
states
of
the
union
so
far
at
least
as
concerned
their
domestic
institutions
were
each
and
all
of
them
under
the
constitution
absolutely
but
the
threats
which
the
black
republicans
held
out
were
tantamount
to
a
proposal
to
set
the
constitution
aside
it
was
their
charter
of
liberty
therefore
and
not
only
their
material
prosperity
which
the
states
that
first
seceded
believed
to
be
endangered
by
lincoln
election
ignorant
of
the
temper
of
the
great
mass
of
the
northern
people
as
loyal
in
reality
to
the
constitution
as
themselves
they
were
only
too
ready
to
be
convinced
that
the
denunciations
of
the
abolitionists
were
the
first
presage
of
the
storm
that
was
presently
to
overwhelm
them
to
reduce
their
states
to
provinces
to
wrest
from
them
the
freedom
they
had
inherited
and
to
make
them
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
to
the
detested
plutocrats
of
new
england
but
the
gravamen
of
the
indictment
against
the
southern
people
is
not
that
they
seceded
but
that
they
seceded
in
order
to
preserve
and
to
perpetuate
slavery
or
to
put
it
more
forcibly
that
the
liberty
to
enslave
others
was
the
right
which
most
they
valued
this
charge
put
forward
by
the
abolitionists
in
order
to
cloak
their
own
revolt
against
the
constitution
is
true
as
regards
a
certain
section
but
as
regards
the
south
as
a
nation
it
is
quite
untenable
for
of
the
population
derived
rather
injury
than
benefit
from
the
presence
in
their
midst
of
four
million
serfs
of
million
whites
in
the
fifteen
states
only
were
and
of
these
owned
only
one
negro
had
slavery
continued
the
system
of
labour
says
general
grant
would
soon
have
impoverished
the
soil
and
left
the
country

have

fortunate

volume
page
the
slaves
neither
bought
nor
sold
their
wants
were
supplied
almost
entirely
by
their
own
labour
and
the
local
markets
of
the
south
would
have
drawn
far
larger
profit
from
a
few
thousand
white
labourers
than
they
did
from
the
multitude
of
negroes
it
is
true
that
a
party
in
the
south
more
numerous
perhaps
among
the
political
leaders
than
among
the
people
at
large
was
averse
to
emancipation
under
any
form
or
shape
there
were
men
who
looked
upon
their
bondsmen
as
mere
beasts
of
burden
more
valuable
but
hardly
more
human
than
the
cattle
in
their
fields
and
who
would
not
only
have
perpetuated
but
have
extended
slavery
there
were
others
who
conscientiously
believed
that
the
negro
was
unfit
for
freedom
that
he
was
incapable
of
and
that
he
was
far
happier
and
more
contented
as
a
slave
among
these
were
ministers
of
the
gospel
in
no
small
number
who
appealing
to
the
old
testament
preached
boldly
that
the
institution
was
of
divine
origin
that
the
coloured
race
had
been
created
for
servitude
and
that
to
advocate
emancipation
was
to
impugn
the
wisdom
of
the
almighty
but
there
were
still
others
including
many
of
those
who
were
not
who
while
they
acquiesced
in
the
existence
of
an
institution
for
which
they
were
not
personally
accountable
looked
forward
to
its
ultimate
extinction
by
the
voluntary
action
of
the
states
concerned
it
was
impossible
as
yet
to
touch
the
question
openly
for
the
invectives
and
injustice
of
the
abolitionists
had
so
wrought
upon
the
southern
people
that
such
action
would
have
been
deemed
a
base
surrender
to
the
dictation
of
the
enemy
but
they
trusted
to
time
to
the
spread
of
education
and
to
a
feeling
in
favour
of
emancipation
which
was
gradually
pervading
the
whole
country
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
feeling
of
aversion
to
slavery
was
fast
spreading
among
a
numerous
and
powerful
class
in
the
south
in
maryland
kentucky
and
missouri
the
number
of
slaves
was
decreasing
and
in
delaware
the
institution
had
almost
disappeared
the
opinions
of
this
party
with
which
it
may
be
said
the
bulk
of
the
northern
people
was
in
close
sympathy
grant
memoirs
page
are
perhaps
best
expressed
in
a
letter
written
by
colonel
robert
lee
the
head
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
virginia
a
large
landed
proprietor
and
and
the
same
officer
who
had
won
such
renown
in
mexico
in
this
enlightened
age
wrote
the
future
of
the
confederate
army
there
are
few
i
believe
but
will
acknowledge
that
slavery
as
an
institution
is
a
moral
and
political
evil
it
is
useless
to
expatiate
on
its
disadvantages
i
think
it
a
greater
evil
to
the
white
than
to
the
coloured
race
and
while
my
feelings
are
strongly
interested
in
the
latter
my
sympathies
are
more
deeply
engaged
for
the
former
the
blacks
are
immeasurably
better
off
here
than
in
africa
morally
socially
and
physically
the
painful
discipline
they
are
undergoing
is
necessary
for
their
instruction
as
a
race
and
i
hope
will
prepare
them
for
better
things
how
long
their
subjection
may
be
necessary
is
known
and
ordered
by
a
merciful
providence
their
emancipation
will
sooner
result
from
the
mild
and
melting
influence
of
christianity
than
from
the
storms
and
contests
of
fiery
controversy
this
influence
though
slow
is
sure
the
doctrines
and
miracles
of
our
saviour
have
required
nearly
two
thousand
years
to
convert
but
a
small
part
of
the
human
race
and
even
among
christian
nations
what
gross
errors
still
exist
while
we
see
the
course
of
the
final
abolition
of
slavery
is
still
onward
and
we
give
it
the
aid
of
our
prayers
and
all
justifiable
means
in
our
power
we
must
leave
the
progress
as
well
as
the
result
in
his
hands
who
sees
the
end
and
who
chooses
to
work
by
slow
things
and
with
whom
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
single
day
the
abolitionist
must
know
this
and
must
see
that
he
has
neither
the
right
nor
the
power
of
operating
except
by
moral
means
and
suasion
if
he
means
well
to
the
slave
he
must
not
create
angry
feelings
in
the
master
although
he
may
not
approve
of
the
mode
by
which
it
pleases
providence
to
accomplish
its
purposes
the
result
will
nevertheless
be
the
same
and
the
reason
he
gives
for
interference
in
what
he
has
no
concern
holds
good
for
every
kind
of
interference
with
our
neighbours
when
we
disapprove
of
their
conduct
with
this
view
of
the
question
jackson
was
in
perfect
agreement
i
am
very
confident
says
his
wife
that
he
would
never
have
fought
for
the
sole
object
of
perpetuating
slavery
he
found
the
institution
a
responsible
and
troublesome
one
and
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
would
prefer
to
see
the
negroes
free
but
he
believed
that
the
bible
taught
that
slavery
was
sanctioned
by
the
creator
himself
who
maketh
all
men
to
differ
and
instituted
laws
for
the
bond
and
free
he
therefore
accepted
slavery
as
it
existed
in
the
south
not
as
a
thing
desirable
in
itself
but
as
allowed
by
providence
for
ends
which
it
was
not
his
business
to
determine
it
may
perhaps
be
maintained
that
to
have
had
no
dealings
with
the
accursed
thing
and
to
have
publicly
advocated
some
process
of
gradual
emancipation
would
have
been
the
nobler
course
but
setting
aside
the
teaching
of
the
churches
and
the
bitter
temper
of
the
time
it
should
be
remembered
that
slavery
although
its
hardships
were
admitted
presented
itself
in
no
repulsive
aspect
to
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
they
regarded
it
with
feelings
very
different
from
those
of
the
abolitionists
whose
acquaintance
with
the
condition
they
reprobated
was
small
in
the
extreme
the
lot
of
the
slaves
the
southerners
were
well
aware
was
far
preferable
to
that
of
the
poor
and
the
destitute
of
great
cities
of
the
victims
of
the
sweater
and
the
inmates
of
fever
dens
the
helpless
negro
had
more
hands
to
succour
him
in
virginia
than
the
starving
white
man
in
new
england
the
children
of
the
plantation
enjoyed
a
far
brighter
existence
than
the
children
of
the
slums
the
worn
and
feeble
were
maintained
by
their
masters
and
the
black
labourer
looking
forward
to
an
old
age
of
ease
and
comfort
among
his
own
people
was
more
fortunate
than
many
a
northern
artisan
moreover
the
brutalities
ascribed
to
the
as
a
class
were
of
rare
occurrence
the
people
of
the
south
were
neither
less
humane
nor
less
moral
than
the
people
of
the
north
or
of
europe
and
it
is
absolutely
inconceivable
that
men
of
high
character
and
women
of
gentle
nature
should
have
looked
with
leniency
on
cruelty
or
have
failed
to
visit
the
offender
with
something
more
than
reprobation
had
the
uncle
tom
cabin
to
wit
which
were
scattered
broadcast
by
the
abolitionists
possessed
more
than
a
vestige
of
truth
men
like
lee
and
jackson
would
never
have
remained
silent
in
the
minds
of
the
northern
people
slavery
was
associated
with
atrocious
cruelty
and
continual
suffering
in
the
eyes
of
the
southerners
on
the
other
hand
it
was
associated
with
great
kindness
and
the
most
affectionate
relations
between
the
planters
and
their
bondsmen
and
if
the
southerners
were
blind
it
is
most
difficult
to
explain
the
remarkable
fact
that
throughout
the
war
although
thousands
of
plantations
and
farms
together
with
thousands
of
women
and
children
all
of
whose
male
relatives
were
in
the
confederate
armies
were
left
entirely
to
the
care
of
the
negroes
both
life
and
property
were
perfectly
secure
such
then
was
the
attitude
of
the
south
towards
slavery
the
institution
had
many
advocates
uncompromising
and
aggressive
but
taking
the
people
as
a
whole
it
was
rather
tolerated
than
approved
and
even
if
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
were
forthcoming
we
should
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
civilised
community
would
have
plunged
into
revolution
in
order
to
maintain
it
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
secession
was
revolution
and
revolutions
as
has
been
well
said
are
not
made
for
the
sake
of
greased
cartridges
to
bring
about
such
unanimity
of
purpose
as
took
possession
of
the
whole
south
such
passionate
loyalty
to
the
new
confederacy
such
intense
determination
to
resist
coercion
to
the
bitter
end
needed
some
motive
of
unusual
potency
and
the
perpetuation
of
slavery
was
not
a
sufficient
motive
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
neither
owned
slaves
nor
was
connected
with
those
who
did
many
favoured
emancipation
and
the
working
men
a
rapidly
increasing
class
were
distinctly
antagonistic
to
moreover
the
southerners
were
not
only
warmly
attached
to
the
union
which
they
had
done
so
much
to
establish
but
their
pride
in
their
common
country
in
its
strength
its
prestige
and
its
prosperity
was
very
great
why
then
should
they
break
away
history
supplies
us
with
a
pertinent
example
previous
to
the
honour
of
england
was
dear
to
the
people
of
the
american
colonies
king
george
had
no
more
devoted
subjects
his
enemies
no
fiercer
foes
and
yet
it
required
very
little
to
reverse
the
scroll
the
right
claimed
by
the
crown
to
tax
the
colonists
hardly
menaced
their
material
prosperity
a
few
shillings
more
or
less
would
neither
have
added
to
the
burdens
nor
have
diminished
the
comforts
of
a
and
thrifty
people
and
there
was
some
justice
in
the
demand
that
they
should
contribute
to
the
defence
of
the
british
empire
but
the
demand
as
formulated
by
the
government
involved
a
principle
which
they
were
unwilling
to
admit
and
in
defence
of
their
birthright
as
free
citizens
they
flew
to
arms
so
in
defence
of
the
principle
of
states
rights
the
southern
people
resolved
upon
secession
with
all
its
consequences
it
might
be
said
however
that
south
carolina
and
her
sister
states
seceded
under
the
threat
of
a
mere
faction
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
attitude
of
the
federal
government
to
justify
the
apprehension
that
the
constitution
would
be
set
aside
and
that
their
action
therefore
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
rank
rebellion
but
whether
their
rights
had
been
infringed
or
not
a
large
majority
of
the
southern
people
believed
that
secession
at
any
moment
and
for
any
cause
was
perfectly
legitimate
the
several
states
of
the
union
according
to
their
political
creed
were
each
and
all
of
them
sovereign
and
independent
nations
the
constitution
they
held
was
nothing
more
than
a
treaty
which
they
had
entered
into
for
their
own
convenience
and
which
in
the
exercise
of
their
sovereign
powers
individually
or
collectively
they
might
abrogate
when
they
pleased
this
interpretation
was
not
admitted
in
the
north
either
by
republicans
or
democrats
yet
there
was
nothing
in
the
letter
of
the
constitution
which
denied
it
and
as
regards
the
spirit
of
that
covenant
north
and
south
held
opposite
opinions
but
both
were
perfectly
sincere
and
in
leaving
the
union
therefore
and
in
creating
for
themselves
a
new
government
the
people
of
the
seceding
states
considered
that
they
were
absolutely
within
their
right
for
an
admirable
statement
of
the
southern
doctrine
see
history
of
the
civil
war
volume
chapter
it
must
be
admitted
at
the
same
time
that
the
action
of
the
states
which
first
seceded
was
marked
by
a
petulant
haste
and
it
is
only
too
probable
that
the
people
of
these
states
suffered
themselves
to
be
too
easily
persuaded
that
the
north
meant
mischief
it
is
impossible
to
determine
how
far
the
professional
politician
was
responsible
for
the
civil
war
but
when
we
recall
the
fact
that
secession
followed
close
on
the
overthrow
of
a
faction
which
had
long
monopolised
the
spoils
of
office
and
that
this
faction
found
compensation
in
the
establishment
of
a
new
government
it
is
not
easy
to
resist
the
suspicion
that
the
secession
movement
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
conspiracy
hatched
by
a
clever
and
unscrupulous
cabal
it
would
be
unwise
however
to
brand
the
whole
or
even
the
majority
of
the
southern
leaders
as
selfish
and
unprincipled
unless
he
has
real
grievances
on
which
to
work
or
unless
those
who
listen
to
him
are
supremely
ignorant
the
mere
agitator
is
powerless
and
it
is
most
assuredly
incredible
that
seven
millions
of
and
of
the
purest
strain
english
lowland
scottish
and
north
irish
should
have
been
beguiled
by
silver
tongues
of
a
few
ambitious
or
demagogues
the
latter
undoubtedly
had
a
share
in
bringing
matters
to
a
crisis
but
the
south
was
ripe
for
revolution
long
before
the
presidential
election
the
forces
which
were
at
work
needed
no
artificial
impulse
to
propel
them
forward
it
was
instinctively
recognised
that
the
nation
had
outgrown
the
constitution
and
it
was
to
this
and
not
to
the
attacks
upon
slavery
that
secession
was
really
due
the
north
had
come
to
regard
the
american
people
as
one
nation
and
the
will
of
the
majority
as
paramount
the
government
had
been
federal
under
the
articles
of
confederation
but
the
northern
people
quickly
recognised
that
that
relation
was
changing
under
the
constitution
they
began
to
discern
that
the
power
they
thought
they
had
delegated
was
in
fact
surrendered
and
that
henceforth
no
single
state
could
meet
the
general
government
as
sovereign
and
equal

the
south
on
the
other
hand
holding
as
it
had
always
held
that
each
state
was
a
nation
in
itself
denied
in
toto
that
the
will
of
the
majority
except
in
certain
specified
cases
had
any
power
whatever
and
where
political
creeds
were
in
such
direct
antagonism
no
compromise
was
possible
moreover
as
the
action
of
the
abolitionists
very
plainly
showed
there
was
a
growing
tendency
in
the
north
to
disregard
altogether
the
rights
of
the
minority
secession
in
fact
was
a
protest
against
mob
rule
the
weaker
community
hopeless
of
maintaining
its
most
cherished
principles
within
the
union
was
ready
to
seize
the
first
pretext
for
leaving
it
and
the
strength
of
the
popular
sentiment
may
be
measured
by
the
willingness
of
every
class
gentle
and
simple
rich
and
poor
to
risk
all
and
to
suffer
all
in
order
to
free
themselves
from
bonds
which
must
soon
have
become
unbearable
it
is
always
difficult
to
analyse
the
motives
of
those
by
whom
revolution
is
provoked
but
if
a
whole
people
acquiesce
it
is
a
certain
proof
of
the
existence
of
universal
apprehension
and
discontent
the
spirit
of
which
animated
the
confederate
south
has
been
characteristic
of
every
revolution
which
has
been
the
expression
of
a
nation
wrongs
but
it
has
never
yet
accompanied
mere
factious
insurrection
when
in
process
of
time
the
history
of
secession
comes
to
be
viewed
with
the
same
freedom
from
prejudice
as
the
history
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
it
will
be
clear
that
the
fourth
great
revolution
of
the
race
differs
in
no
essential
characteristic
from
those
which
preceded
it
it
was
not
simply
because
the
five
members
were
illegally
impeached
in
the
seven
bishops
illegally
tried
in
men
shot
at
lexington
in
or
slavery
threatened
in
that
the
people
rose
these
were
the
occasions
not
the
causes
of
revolt
in
each
case
a
great
principle
was
at
stake
in
the
liberty
of
the
subject
in
the
integrity
of
the
protestant
faith
in
taxation
only
with
consent
of
the
taxed
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
states
it
has
been
remarked
that
states
rights
as
a
political
principle
can
not
be
placed
on
the
same
plane
as
those
with
which
it
is
here
grouped
history
however
proves
conclusively
that
although
it
may
be
less
vital
to
the
common
weal
the
right
of
is
just
as
deeply
cherished
a
people
that
has
once
enjoyed
independence
can
seldom
be
brought
to
admit
that
a
union
with
others
deprives
it
of
the
prerogatives
of
sovereignty
and
it
would
seem
that
the
treatment
of
this
instinct
of
nationality
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
and
important
tasks
of
statesmanship
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
as
already
suggested
has
been
consistently
denied
that
the
only
principle
involved
in
secession
was
the
establishment
of
slavery
on
a
firmer
basis
and
that
the
cry
of
states
rights
was
raised
only
by
way
of
securing
sympathy
is
a
very
general
opinion
but
before
it
can
be
accepted
it
is
necessary
to
make
several
admissions
first
that
the
southerners
were
absolutely
callous
to
the
evils
produced
by
the
institution
they
had
determined
to
make
permanent
second
that
they
had
persuaded
themselves
in
face
of
the
tendencies
of
civilisation
that
it
was
possible
to
make
it
permanent
and
third
that
they
conscientiously
held
their
progress
and
prosperity
to
be
dependent
on
its
continued
existence
are
we
to
believe
that
the
standard
of
morals
and
intelligence
was
so
low
as
these
admissions
would
indicate
are
we
to
believe
that
if
they
had
been
approached
in
a
charitable
spirit
that
if
the
republican
party
disclaiming
all
right
of
interference
had
offered
to
aid
them
in
substituting
by
some
means
which
would
have
provided
for
the
control
of
the
negro
and
at
the
same
time
have
prevented
an
entire
collapse
of
the
social
fabric
a
system
more
consonant
with
humanity
the
southerners
would
have
still
preferred
to
leave
the
union
and
by
creating
a
great
earn
the
execration
of
the
christian
world
unless
the
south
be
credited
with
an
unusual
measure
of
depravity
and
of
the
reply
can
hardly
be
in
the
affirmative
and
if
it
be
otherwise
there
remains
but
one
explanation
of
the
conduct
of
the
seceding
states
namely
the
dread
that
if
they
remained
in
the
union
they
would
not
be
fairly
treated
it
is
futile
to
argue
that
the
people
were
dragooned
into
secession
by
the
what
power
had
the
over
the
great
mass
of
the
population
over
the
professional
classes
over
the
small
farmer
the
mechanic
the
tradesman
the
labourer
yet
it
is
constantly
asserted
by
northern
writers
although
the
statement
is
virtually
an
admission
that
only
the
few
were
prepared
to
fight
for
slavery
that
the
federal
sentiment
was
so
strong
among
the
southerners
that
terrorism
must
have
had
a
large
share
in
turning
them
into
separatists
the
answer
putting
aside
the
very
patent
fact
that
the
southerner
was
not
easily
coerced
is
very
plain
undoubtedly
throughout
the
south
there
was
much
affection
for
the
union
but
so
in
the
first
revolution
there
was
much
loyalty
to
the
crown
and
yet
it
has
never
been
asserted
that
the
people
of
virginia
or
of
new
england
were
forced
into
sedition
against
their
will
the
truth
is
that
there
were
many
southerners
who
in
the
vain
hope
of
compromise
would
have
postponed
the
rupture
but
when
the
right
of
secession
was
questioned
and
the
right
of
coercion
was
proclaimed
all
differences
of
opinion
were
swept
away
and
the
people
thenceforward
were
of
one
heart
and
mind
the
action
of
virginia
is
a
striking
illustration
the
great
border
state
the
most
important
of
those
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
was
not
a
member
of
the
confederacy
when
the
provisional
government
was
established
at
montgomery
nor
did
the
secession
movement
secure
any
strong
measure
of
approval
in
fact
the
people
of
virginia
owing
to
their
closer
proximity
to
and
to
their
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
north
were
by
no
means
inclined
to
make
of
the
black
republican
president
the
bugbear
he
appeared
to
the
states
which
bordered
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
whilst
acknowledging
that
the
south
had
grievances
they
saw
no
reason
to
believe
that
redress
might
not
be
obtained
by
constitutional
means
at
the
same
time
although
they
questioned
the
expediency
they
held
no
opinion
as
to
the
right
of
secession
and
in
their
particular
case
the
right
seems
undeniable
when
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
ratified
virginia
by
the
mouth
of
its
legislature
had
solemnly
declared
that
the
powers
granted
to
the
federal
government
under
the
constitution
being
truly
derived
from
the
people
of
the
united
states
may
be
resumed
by
them
whenever
the
same
shall
be
perverted
to
their
injury
and
oppression
and
this
declaration
had
been
more
than
once
reaffirmed
as
already
stated
this
view
of
the
political
status
of
the
virginia
citizen
was
not
endorsed
by
the
north
nevertheless
it
was
not
definitely
rejected
the
majority
of
the
northern
people
held
the
federal
government
paramount
but
at
the
same
time
they
held
that
it
had
no
power
either
to
punish
or
coerce
the
individual
states
this
had
been
the
attitude
of
the
founders
of
the
republic
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
their
interpretation
of
the
constitution
was
this
although
the
several
states
were
morally
bound
to
maintain
the
compact
into
which
they
had
voluntarily
entered
the
obligation
if
any
one
state
chose
to
repudiate
it
could
not
be
legally
enforced
their
ideal
was
a
union
based
upon
fraternal
affection
and
in
the
halcyon
days
of
washington
first
presidency
when
the
long
and
victorious
struggle
against
a
common
enemy
was
still
fresh
in
men
minds
and
the
sun
of
liberty
shone
in
an
unclouded
sky
a
vision
so
utopian
perhaps
seemed
capable
of
realisation
at
all
events
the
promise
of
a
new
era
of
unbroken
peace
and
prosperity
was
not
to
be
sullied
by
cold
precautions
against
civil
dissensions
and
conflicting
interests
the
new
order
under
which
every
man
was
his
own
sovereign
would
surely
strengthen
the
links
of
kindly
sympathy
and
by
those
links
alone
it
was
believed
that
the
union
would
be
held
together
such
was
the
dream
of
the
unselfish
patriots
who
ruled
the
destinies
of
the
infant
republic
such
were
the
ideas
that
so
far
influenced
their
deliberations
that
with
all
their
wisdom
they
left
a
legacy
to
their
posterity
which
deluged
the
land
in
blood
lincoln
predecessor
in
the
presidential
chair
had
publicly
proclaimed
that
coercion
was
both
illegal
and
inexpedient
and
for
the
three
months
which
intervened
between
the
secession
of
south
carolina
and
the
inauguration
of
the
republican
president
the
government
made
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
peaceable
establishment
of
the
new
confederacy
not
a
single
soldier
reinforced
the
garrisons
of
the
military
posts
in
the
south
not
a
single
regiment
was
recalled
from
the
western
frontiers
and
the
seceded
states
without
a
word
of
protest
were
permitted
to
take
possession
with
few
exceptions
of
the
forts
arsenals
navy
yards
and
custom
houses
which
stood
on
their
own
territory
it
seemed
that
the
federal
government
was
only
waiting
until
an
amicable
arrangement
might
be
arrived
at
as
to
the
terms
of
separation
if
in
addition
to
the
words
in
which
she
had
assented
to
the
constitution
further
justification
were
needed
for
the
belief
of
virginia
in
the
right
of
secession
it
was
assuredly
to
be
found
in
the
apparent
want
of
unanimity
on
so
grave
a
question
even
in
the
republican
party
and
in
the
acquiescent
attitude
of
the
federal
government
the
people
of
virginia
however
saw
in
the
election
of
a
republican
president
no
immediate
danger
of
the
constitution
being
perverted
to
their
injury
and
oppression
the
north
generally
speaking
regarded
the
action
of
the
secessionists
with
that
strange
and
tolerance
with
which
the
american
citizen
too
often
regards
internal
politics
the
common
sense
of
the
nation
asserted
itself
in
all
its
strength
a
union
which
could
only
be
maintained
by
force
was
a
strange
and
obnoxious
idea
to
the
majority
amid
the
storm
of
abuse
and
insult
in
which
the
two
extreme
parties
indulged
the
abolitionists
on
the
one
side
the
politicians
on
the
other
lincoln
the
still
strong
man
in
a
blatant
land
stood
calm
and
steadfast
promising
justice
to
the
south
and
eager
for
reconciliation
and
lincoln
represented
the
real
temper
of
the
northern
people
so
in
the
earlier
months
of
there
was
no
sign
whatever
that
the
old
dominion
might
be
compelled
to
use
the
alternative
her
original
representatives
had
reserved
the
question
of
slavery
was
no
longer
to
the
fore
while
reprobating
the
action
of
the
confederates
the
president
in
his
inaugural
address
march
had
declared
that
the
government
had
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
individual
states
and
throughout
virginia
the
feeling
was
strong
in
favour
of
the
union
earnest
endeavours
were
made
to
effect
a
compromise
under
which
the
seceded
communities
might
renew
the
federal
compact
the
legislature
called
a
convention
of
the
people
to
deliberate
on
the
part
that
the
state
should
play
and
the
other
states
were
invited
to
join
in
a
peace
conference
at
washington
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
during
the
period
of
negotiation
excitement
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
the
political
situation
was
the
sole
theme
of
discussion
in
lexington
as
elsewhere
the
one
absorbing
topic
ousted
all
others
and
in
lexington
as
elsewhere
there
was
much
difference
of
opinion
but
the
general
sentiment
was
strongly
unionist
and
in
the
election
of
members
of
the
convention
an
overwhelming
majority
had
pronounced
against
secession
between
the
two
parties
however
there
were
sharp
conflicts
a
flagstaff
flying
the
national
ensign
had
been
erected
in
main
street
lexington
the
cadets
fired
on
the
flag
and
substituting
the
state
colours
placed
a
guard
over
them
next
morning
a
report
reached
the
institute
that
the
local
company
of
volunteers
had
driven
off
the
guard
and
were
about
to
restore
the
stars
and
stripes
it
was
a
holiday
and
there
were
no
officers
present
the
drums
beat
to
arms
the
boys
rushed
down
to
their
buckling
on
their
belts
and
carrying
their
rifles
ammunition
was
distributed
and
the
whole
battalion
under
the
cadet
officers
marched
out
of
the
institute
gates
determined
to
lower
the
emblem
of
northern
tyranny
and
drive
away
the
volunteers
a
collision
would
certainly
have
ensued
had
not
the
attacking
column
been
met
by
the
commandant
in
every
discussion
on
the
action
of
the
state
jackson
had
spoken
strongly
on
the
side
of
the
majority
in
terse
phrase
he
had
summed
up
his
view
of
the
situation
he
was
no
advocate
of
secession
he
deprecated
the
hasty
action
of
south
carolina
it
is
better
he
said
for
the
south
to
fight
for
her
rights
in
the
union
than
out
of
it
but
much
as
they
loved
the
union
the
people
of
virginia
revered
still
more
the
principles
inculcated
by
their
forefathers
the
right
of
secession
and
the
illegality
of
coercion
and
when
the
proposals
of
the
peace
conference
came
to
nothing
when
all
hope
of
compromise
died
away
and
the
federal
government
showed
no
sign
of
recognising
the
provisional
government
it
became
evident
even
to
the
staunchest
unionist
that
civil
war
could
no
longer
be
postponed
from
the
very
first
no
shadow
of

had
existed
in
jackson
mind
as
to
the
side
he
should
espouse
or
the
course
he
should
pursue
if
i
know
myself
he
wrote
all
i
am
and
all
i
have
is
at
the
service
of
my
country
according
to
his
political
creed
his
country
was
his
native
state
and
such
was
the
creed
of
the
whole
south
in
conforming
to
the
ordinance
of
secession
enacted
by
the
legislatures
of
their
own
states
the
people
according
to
their
reading
of
the
constitution
acted
as
loyal
and
patriotic
citizens
to
resist
that
ordinance
was
treason
and
rebellion
and
in
taking
up
arms
they
were
not
in
their
own
opinion
rebels
at
all
they
were
defending
their
states

which

themselves
to
belong

when
after
the
incident
described
above
the
cadets
marched
back
to
barracks
it
was
already
so
certain
that
the
stars
and
stripes
would
soon
be
torn
down
from
every
flagstaff
in
virginia
that
their
breach
of
discipline
was
easily
condoned
they
were
addressed
by
the
commandant
and
amid
growing
excitement
officer
after
officer
hardly
concealing
his
sympathy
with
their
action
gave
vent
to
his
opinions
on
the
approaching
crisis
jackson
was
silent
at
length
perhaps
in
anticipation
of
some
amusement
for
he
was
known
to
be
a
stumbling
speaker
the
cadets
called
on
him
by
name
in
answer
to
the
summons
he
stood
before
them
not
as
was
his
wont
in
public
assemblies
with
shyness
and
awkward
gesture
but
with
body
erect
and
eyes
sparkling
soldiers
he
said
when
they
make
speeches
should
say
but
few
words
and
speak
them
to
the
point
and
i
admire
young
gentlemen
the
spirit
you
have
shown
in
rushing
to
the
defence
of
your
comrades
but
i
must
commend
you
particularly
for
the
readiness
with
which
you
listened
to
the
counsel
and
obeyed
the
commands
of
your
superior
officer
the
time
may
come
he
continued
and
the
deep
tones
vibrating
with
unsuspected
resolution
held
his
audience
spellbound
when
your
state
will
need
your
services
and
if
that
time
does
come
then
draw
your
swords
and
throw
away

scabbards
the
crisis
was
not
long
postponed

the

was
held
by
a
federal
garrison
the
state
had
demanded
its
surrender
but
no
reply
had
been
vouchsafed
by
lincoln
on

a
message
was
conveyed
to
the
governor
of
the
state
that
an
attempt
would
be
made
to
supply
the
troops
with
provisions
this
message
was
telegraphed
to
montgomery
still
the
capital
of
the
confederacy
and
the
government
ordered
the
reduction
of
the
fort
on
the
morning
of

the
southern
batteries
opened

and
the
next

when

was

the
insult
to
the

set
the
blood
of
the
nation
of
democrat
and
republican
aflame
the
time
for
reconciliation
was
passed
the
confederates
had
committed
an
unpardonable
crime
they
had
forfeited
all
title
to
consideration
and
even
in
the
minds
of
those
northerners
who
had
shared
their
political
creed
the
memory
of
their
grievances
was
obliterated
so
far
virginia
had
given
no
overt
sign
of
sympathy
with
the
revolution
but
she
was
now
called
upon
to
furnish
her
quota
of
regiments
for
the
federal
army
to
have
acceded
to
the
demand
would
have
been
to
abjure
the
most
cherished
principles
of
her
political
existence
as
the
federal
government
according
to
her
political
faith
had
no
jurisdiction
whatever
within
the
boundaries
of
states
which
had
chosen
to
secede
it
had
not
the
slightest
right
to
maintain
a
garrison
in
fort
sumter
the
action
of
the
confederacy
in
enforcing
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
was
not
generally
approved
of
but
it
was
held
to
be
perfectly
legitimate
and
lincoln
appeal
to
arms
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
what
in
the
opinion
of
virginia
was
a
strictly
constitutional
movement
was
instantly
and
fiercely
challenged
neutrality
was
impossible
she
was
bound
to
furnish
her
tale
of
troops
and
thus
belie
her
principles
or
to
secede
at
once
and
reject
with
a
clean
conscience
the
president
mandate
on
april
she
chose
the
latter
deliberately
and
with
her
eyes
open
knowing
that
war
would
be
the
result
and
knowing
the
vast
resources
of
the
north
she
was
followed
by
arkansas
tennessee
and
north
carolina
kentucky
and
missouri
attempted
to
remain
neutral
maryland
was
held
in

by

the
world
has
long
since
done
justice
to
the
motives
of
cromwell
and
of
washington
and
signs
are
not
wanting
that
before
many
years
have
passed
it
will
do
justice
to
the
motives
of
the
southern
people
they
were
true
to
their
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
if
the
morality
of
secession
may
be
questioned
if
south
carolina
acted
with
undue
haste
and
without
sufficient
provocation
if
certain
of
the
southern
politicians
desired
emancipation
for
themselves
that
they
might
continue
to
enslave
others
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
the
action
of
virginia
was
not
only
fully
justified
but
beyond
suspicion
the
wildest
threats
of
the
black
republicans
their
loudly
expressed
determination
in
defiance
of
the
constitution
to
abolish
slavery
if
necessary
by
the
bullet
and
the
sabre
shook
in
no
degree
whatever
her
loyalty
to
the
union
her
best
endeavours
were
exerted
to
maintain
the
peace
between
the
hostile
sections
and
not
till
her
liberties
were
menaced
did
she
repudiate
a
compact
which
had
become
intolerable
it
was
to
preserve
the
freedom
which
her
forefathers
had
bequeathed
her
and
which
she
desired
to
hand
down
unsullied
to
future
generations
that
she
acquiesced
in
the
revolution
the
north
in
resolving
to
maintain
the
union
by
force
of
arms
was
upheld
by
the
belief
that
she
was
acting
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
the
south
in
asserting
her
independence
and
resisting
coercion
found
moral
support
in
the
same
conviction
and
the
patriotism
of
those
who
fought
for
the
union
was
neither
purer
nor
more
ardent
than
the
patriotism
of
those
who
fought
for
rights
long
ago
a
parliament
of
that
nation
to
which
jackson
and
so
many
of
his
compatriots
owed
their
origin
made
petition
to
the
pope
that
he
should
require
the
english
king
to
respect
the
independence
of
scotland
and
to
mind
his
own
affairs
so
long
as
a
hundred
of
us
are
left
alive
said
the
signatories
we
will
never
in
any
degree
be
subjected
to
the
english
it
is
not
for
glory
or
for
riches
or
for
honour
that
we
fight
but
for
liberty
alone
which
no
good
man
loses
but
with
his
life
more
than
five
hundred
years
later
for
the
same
noble
cause
and
in
the
same
uncompromising
spirit
the
people
of
virginia
made
appeal
to
the
god
of
battles
chapter
harper
ferry
immediately
it
became
apparent
that
the
north
was
bent
upon
jackson
offered
his
sword
to
his
native
state
he
was
determined
to
take
his
share
in
defending
her
rights
and
liberties
even
if
it
were
only
as
a
private
soldier
devotion
to
virginia
was
his
sole
motive
he
shrank
from
the
horrors
of
civil
strife
the
thought
that
the
land
he
loved
so
well
was
to
be
deluged
with
the
blood
of
her
own
children
that
the
happy
hearths
of
america
were
to
be
desecrated
by
the
hideous
image
of
war
stifled
the
promptings
of
professional
ambition
if
the
general
government
he
said
should
persist
in
the
measures
now
threatened
there
must
be
war
it
is
painful
enough
to
discover
with
what
unconcern
they
speak
of
war
and
threaten
it
they
do
not
know
its
horrors
i
have
seen
enough
of
it
to
make
me
look
upon
it
as
the
sum
of
all
evils
the
methods
he
resorted
to
in
order
that
the
conflict
might
be
averted
were
characteristic
he
proposed
to
the
minister
of
his
church
that
all
christian
people
should
be
called
upon
to
unite
in
prayer
and
in
his
own
devotions
says
his
wife
he
asked
with
importunity
that
if
it
were
god
will
the
whole
land
might
be
at
peace
his
work
after
the
ordinance
of
secession
had
been
passed
was
constant
and
absorbing
the
governor
of
virginia
had
informed
the
superintendent
of
the
institute
that
he
should
need
the
services
of
the
more
advanced
classes
as
and
that
they
must
be
prepared
to
leave
for
richmond
under
the
command
of
major
jackson
at
a
moment
notice
the
lexington
presbytery
was
holding
its
spring
meeting
in
the
church
which
jackson
attended
and
some
of
the
members
were
entertained
at
his
house
but
he
found
no
time
to
attend
a
single
service
every
hour
was
devoted
to
the
duty
he
had
in
hand
on
the
saturday
of
that
eventful
week
he
expressed
the
hope
that
he
would
not
be
called
upon
to
leave
till
monday
and
bidding
his
wife
dismiss
from
her
thoughts
everything
pertaining
to
the
war
and
his
departure
they
spent
that
evening
as
they
had
been
accustomed
reading
aloud
from
religious
magazines
and
studying
together
the
lesson
which
was
to
be
taught
on
the
morrow
in
the
but
at
dawn
the
next
morning
came
a
telegram
directing
major
jackson
to
bring
the
cadets
to
richmond
immediately
he
repaired
at
once
to
the
institute
and
at
one
after
divine
service
at
his
request
had
been
held
at
the
head
of
the
command
the
cadet
battalion
marched
to
staunton
on
the
virginia
central
railway
and
there
took
train
camp
lee
the
rendezvous
of
the
virginia
army
presented
a
peculiar
if
animated
scene
with
few
exceptions
every
man
capable
of
serving
in
the
field
belonged
either
to
the
militia
or
the
volunteers
some
of
the
companies
had
a
smattering
of
drill
but
the
majority
were
absolutely
untaught
and
the
whole
were
without
the
slightest
conception
of
what
was
meant
by
discipline
and
it
was
difficult
to
teach
them
the
officers
and
men
of
the
united
states
army
were
either
irish
or
germans
without
state
ties
and
they
had
consequently
no
inducement
to
join
the
south
with
the
officers
it
was
different
they
were
citizens
first
and
soldiers
afterwards
and
as
citizens
their
allegiance
so
far
as
those
of
southern
birth
were
concerned
was
due
to
their
native
states
out
of
the
twelve
hundred
graduates
of
west
point
who
at
the
beginning
of
were
still
fit
for
service
a
fourth
were
southerners
and
these
almost
without
exception
at
once
took
service
with
the
confederacy
but
the
regular
officers
were
almost
all
required
for
the
higher
commands
for
technical
duties
and
the
staff
thus
very
few
were
left
to
instruct
the
volunteers
the
intelligence
of
the
men
was
high
for
every
profession
and
every
class
was
represented
in
the
ranks
and
many
of
the
wealthiest
planters
preferred
so
earnest
was
their
patriotism
to
serve
as
privates
but
as
yet
they
were
merely
the
elements
of
a
fine
army
and
nothing
more
their
equipment
left
as
much
to
be
desired
as
their
training
arms
were
far
scarcer
than
men
the
limited
supply
of
rifles
in
the
state
arsenals
was
soon
exhausted
flintlock
muskets
converted
to
percussion
action
were
then
supplied
but
no
inconsiderable
numbers
of
and
were
to
be
seen
amongst
the
infantry
while
the
cavalry
in
default
of
sabres
carried
rude
lances
fabricated
by
country
blacksmiths
some
of
the
troops
wore
uniform
the
blue
of
the
militia
or
the
grey
of
the
cadet
but
many
of
the
companies
drilled
and
manoeuvred
in
plain
clothes
and
it
was
not
till
three
months
later
on
the
eve
of
the
first
great
battle
that
the
whole
of
the
infantry
had
received
their
bayonets
and
cartridge
boxes
an
assemblage
so
motley
could
hardly
be
called
an
army
and
the
daring
of
the
government
who
with
this
levee
en
masse
as
their
only
bulwark
against
invasion
had
defied
a
great
power
seems
at
first
sight
strongly
allied
to
folly
but
there
was
little
cause
for
apprehension
the
federal
authorities
were
as
yet
powerless
to
enforce
the
policy
of
invasion
on
which
the
president
had
resolved
the
great
bulk
of
the
northern
troops
were
just
as
far
from
being
soldiers
as
the
virginians
and
the
regular
army
was
too
small
to
be
feared
the
people
of
the
united
states
had
long
cherished
the
utopian
dream
that
war
was
impossible
upon
their
favoured
soil
the
militia
was
considered
an
archeological
absurdity
the
regular
troops
admirable
as
was
their
work
upon
the
frontier
were
far
from
being
a
source
of
national
pride
the
uniform
was
held
to
be
a
badge
of
servitude
the
drunken
loafer
bartering
his
vote
for
a
dollar
or
a
dram
looked
down
with
the
contempt
of
a
sovereign
citizen
upon
men
who
submitted
to
the
indignity
of
discipline
and
in
denouncing
the
expense
of
a
standing
army
unscrupulous
politicians
found
a
sure
path
to
popular
favour
so
when
secession
became
something
more
than
a
mere
threat
the
armed
forces
of
the
commonwealth
had
been
reduced
almost
to
extinction
and
when
the
flag
was
fired
upon
the
nation
found
itself
powerless
to
resent
the
insult
the
military
establishment
mustered
no
more
than
officers
and
men
there
was
no
reserve
no
transport
no
organisation
for
war
and
the
troops
were
scattered
in
distant
garrisons
the
navy
consisted
of
six
only
one
of
which
was
in
commission
of
five
steam
sloops
some
twenty
sailing
ships
and
a
few
the
majority
of
the
vessels
although
well
armed
were
out
of
date
officers
and
men
were
the
extent
of
the
personnel
and
several
useful
craft
together
with
more

although
her

of
seven

was
smaller
by
than
that
of
the

was
thus
far
from
hopeless
the
north
undoubtedly
possessed
immense
resources
but
an
efficient
army
even
when
the
supply
of
men
and
arms
be
unlimited
can
not
be
created
in
a
few

even
in
a

of
all
an
army
of

undisciplined
troops

possibly
stand
their
ground
on

as
did
jackson
riflemen
at

or
the
colonials
at

but
fighting
behind
earthworks
is
a
very
different
matter
to
making
long
marches
and
executing
complicated
manoeuvres
under
heavy
fire
without
a
trained
staff
and
an
efficient
administration
an
army
is
incapable
of
movement
even
with
a
commissariat
it
is
a
most
difficult
business
to
keep
a
marching
column
supplied
with
food
and
forage
and
the
problem
of
transport
unless
a
railway
or
a

be
available
taxes
the
ability
of
the
most
experienced
leader
a
march
of
eighty
or
one
hundred
miles
into
an
enemy
country
sounds
a
simple
feat
but
unless
every
detail
has
been
most
carefully
thought
out
it
will
not
improbably
be
more
disastrous
than
a
lost
battle
a
march
of
two
or
three
hundred
miles
is
a
great
military
operation
a
march
of
six
hundred
an
enterprise
of
which
there
are
few
examples
to
handle
an
army
in
battle
is
much
less
difficult
than
to
bring
it
on
to
the
field
in
good
condition
and
the
student
of
the
civil
war
may
note
with
profit
how
exceedingly
chary
were
the
generals
during
the
first
campaigns
of
leaving
their
magazines
it
was
not
till
their
auxiliary
services
had
gained
experience
that
they
dared
to
manoeuvre
freely
and
the
reason
lay
not
only
in
deficiencies
of
organisation
but
in
the
nature
of
the
country
even
for
a
stationary
force
standing
on
the
defensive
unless
immediately
backed
by
a
large
town
or
a
railway
the
difficulties
of
bringing
up
supplies
were
enormous
for
an
invading
army
increasing
day
by
day
the
distance
from
its
base
they
became
almost
insuperable
in
the
population
of
the

over
a
territory
as
large
as

was
less
than
that
of

a
great
part
of
that

practically
unexplored
even
at

their

but
a
handful
in
comparison
with
the

of
their

their
extraordinary

not
much
more
than
a
scratch
on
the
surface
of
the

in

nature
has
long
since
receded
before
the

of

the

between

has
but
just
begun

except
upon

is
almost
lost
to
sight
in
the
vast
spaces
he
has
yet
to
conquer
in
many
of
the

of
the

the

seem
set
in
clearings
of
the
primeval

the

on
the

and
within

reach
of
the

districts
where

still
roam
undisturbed
the
traveller
lands
in
a
metropolis
as
large
as

before
a
few
hours
have
passed
he
may
find
himself
in
a
wilderness
as
solitary
as
the
transvaal
and
although
within
the
boundaries
of
the
townships
he
sees
little
that
differs
from
the
england
of
the
nineteenth
century
beyond
them
there
is
much
that
resembles
the
england
of
the
restoration
except
over
a
comparatively
small
area
an
army
operating
in
the
united
states
would
meet
with
the

obstacles
as
did
the

of

cultivated
great

from

of

plateaus
in

a

sufficient
to
convert
the

a

as
large
as

english
county
are
covered
with
pathless

penetrating
even
the
most
lonely

afford
it
is
true
such
facilities
for
moving
and
feeding
large
bodies
of
men
that
the
difficulties
presented
by
untamed
nature
have
undoubtedly
been
much
reduced
nevertheless
the
whole
country
even
would
be
essentially
different
from
any
european
theatre
of

save
the
steppes
of
russia
and
in
railways
were
few
and
the
population
comparatively
insignificant
the
impediments
then
in
the
way
of
military
operations
were
such
as
no
soldier
of
experience
would
willingly
encounter
with
an
improvised
army
it
was
no
petty
republic
that
the
north
had
undertaken
to
coerce
the
frontiers
of
the
confederacy
were
far
apart
the

although
in

and
the
ohio
the
federals
possessed
two
excellent
bases
of
invasion
on
which
it
was
easy
to
accumulate
both
men
and
supplies
the
task
before
them
even
had
the
regular
army
been
large
and
well
equipped
would
have
been
sufficiently
formidable
the
city
of
atlanta
which
may
be
considered
as
the
heart
of
the
confederacy
was
sixty
days
march
from
the
potomac
the
same
distance
as
vienna
from
the
english
channel
or
moscow
from
the
niemen
new
orleans
the
commercial
metropolis
was
march
from
the
ohio
the
same
distance
as
berlin
from
the
moselle
thus
space
was
all
in
favour
of
the
south
even
should
the
enemy
overrun
her
borders
her
principal
cities
few
in
number
were
far
removed
from
the
hostile
bases
and
the
important
railway
junctions
were
perfectly
secure
from
sudden
attack
and
space
especially
when
means
of
communication
are
scanty
and
the
country
affords
few
supplies
is
the
greatest
of
all
obstacles
the
hostile
territory
must
be
subjugated
piecemeal
state
by
state
province
by
province
as
was
asia
by
alexander
and
after
each
victory
a
new
base
of
supply
must
be
provisioned
and
secured
no
matter
at
what
cost
of
time
before
a
further
advance
can
be
attempted
had
napoleon
in
the
campaign
against
russia
remained
for
the
winter
at
smolensko
and
firmly
established
himself
in
poland
moscow
might
have
been
captured
and
held
during
the
ensuing
summer
but
the
occupation
of
moscow
would
not
have
ended
the
war
russia
in
many
respects
was
not
unlike
the
confederacy
she
had
given
no
hostages
to
fortune
in
the
shape
of
rich
commercial
towns
she
possessed
no
historic
fortresses
and
so
offered
but
few
objectives
to
an
invader
if
defeated
or
retreating
her
armies
could
always
find
refuge
in
distant
fastnesses
the
climate
was
severe
the
internal
trade
inconsiderable
to
bring
the
burden
of
war
home
to
the
mass
of
the
population
was
difficult
and
to
hold
the
country
by
force
impracticable
such
were
the
difficulties
which
the
genius
of
napoleon
was
powerless
to
overcome
and
napoleon
invaded
russia
with
half
a
million
of
seasoned
soldiers
and
yet
with
an
army
of
volunteers
and
without
the
least
preparation
the
federal
government
was
about
to
attempt
an
enterprise
of
even
greater
magnitude
the
northern
states
were
not
bent
merely
on
invasion
but
on
not
merely
on
defeating
the
hostile
armies
on
occupying
their
capital
and
exacting
contributions
but
on
forcing
a
proud
people
to
surrender
their
most
cherished
principles
to
give
up
their
own
government
and
to
submit
themselves
for
good
and
all
to
what
was
practically
a
foreign
yoke
and
this
was
not
all
it
has
been
well
said
by
a
soldier
of
napoleon
writing
of
the
war
in
spain
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
army
are
the
real
bulwarks
against
foreign
aggression
but
the
national
character
the
downfall
of
austria
and
of
prussia
was
practically
decided
by
the
first
great
battle
the
nations
yielded
without
further
struggle
strangers
to
freedom
crushed
by
military
absolutism
the
prostration
of
each
and
all
to
an
irresponsible
despot
had
paralysed
individual
energy
spain
on
the
other
hand
without
an
army
and
without
a
ruler
but
deriving
new
strength
from
each
successive
defeat
first
taught
napoleon
that
he
was
not
invincible
and
the
same
spirit
of
liberty
which
inspired
the
people
of
the
peninsula
inspired
to
an
even
higher
degree
the
people
of
the
confederate
states
map
the
united
states
the
northern
states
moreover
were
about
to
make
a
new
departure
in
war
the
manhood
of
a
country
has
often
been
called
upon
to
defend
its
borders
but
never
before
had
it
been
proposed
to
invade
a
vast
territory
with
a
civilian
army
composed
it
is
true
of
the
best
blood
in
the
republic
but
without
the
least
tincture
of
military
experience
nor
did
the
senior
officers
professionals
though
they
were
appear
more
fitted
for
the
enterprise
than
the
men
they
led
the
command
of
a
company
or
squadron
against
the
redskins
was
hardly
an
adequate
probation
for
the
command
of
an
army
or
even
a
brigade
of
raw
troops
against
a
foe
even
after
the
peninsular
war
had
enlarged
the
experience
of
the
british
army
sir
charles
napier
declared
that
he
knew
but
one
general
who
could
handle
men
and
that
was
the
duke
of
wellington
had
the
volunteers
been
associated
with
an
equal
number
of
trained
and
disciplined
soldiers
as
had
been
the
case
in
mexico
grant
memoirs
volume
page
they
would
have
derived
both
confidence
from
their
presence
and
stability
from
their
example
had
there
been
even
an
experienced
staff
capable
of
dealing
with
large
forces
and
an
efficient
commissariat
capable
of
rapid
expansion
they
might
have
crushed
all
organised
opposition
but
only
regulars
could
be
drawn
from
the
western
borders
the
staff
was
as
feeble
as
the
commissariat
and
so
from
a
purely
military
point
of
view
the
conquest
of
the
south
appeared
impossible
her
power
was
far
greater
than
has
been
usually
imagined
on
the
broad
prairies
of
texas
arkansas
and
louisiana
ranged
innumerable
herds
the
area
under
cultivation
was
almost
equal
to
that
north
of
the
potomac
and
the
ohio
the
pastoral
districts
the
beautiful
valley
of
virginia
the
great
plains
of
georgia
the
fertile
bottoms
of
alabama
were
inexhaustible
granaries
the
amount
of
live
stock
horses
mules
oxen
and
sheep
was
actually
larger
than
in
the
north
and
if
the
acreage
under
wheat
was
less
extensive
the
deficiency
was
more
than
balanced
by
the
great
harvests
of
rice
and
maize
cf

men
of
high
ability
but
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
conditions

back
to
the

within
ninety
days

by
a
young
and
able
general
a
wolfe
a

with

kept
up
to
that
number
nevertheless
despite
the
extent
of
her
territory
and
her
scanty
means
of
communication
the
south
was
peculiarly
vulnerable
few
factories
or
foundries
had
been
established
within
her
frontiers
she
manufactured
nothing
and
not
only
for
all
luxuries
but
for
almost
every
necessary
of
life
she
was
dependent
upon
others
her
cotton
and
tobacco
brought
leather
and
cloth
in
exchange
from
england
metals
machinery
rails
rolling
stock
salt
and
even
medicines
came
for
the
most
part
from
the
north
the
weapons
which
she
put
into
her
soldiers
hands
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
her
cannon
powder
and
ammunition
were
of
foreign
make
more
than
all
her
mercantile
marine
was
very
small
her
foreign
trade
was
in
the
hands
of
northern
merchants
she
had
for
norfolk
and
pensacola
both
national
establishments
were
within
her
boundaries
but
her
seafaring
population
was
inconsiderable
and
shipbuilding
was
almost
an
unknown
industry
strong
on
land
she
was
powerless
at
sea
and
yet
it
was
on
the
sea
that
her
prosperity
depended
cotton
the
principal
staple
of
her
wealth
demanded
free
access
to
the
european
markets
but
without
a
navy
and
without
the
means
of
constructing
one
or
of
manning
the
vessels
that
she
might
easily
have
purchased
she
was
unable
to
keep
open
her
communications
across
the
atlantic
nor
was
it
on
the
ocean
alone
that
the
south
was
at
a
disadvantage
the
mississippi
the
main
artery
of
her
commerce
which
brought
the
harvests
of
the
plantations
to
new
orleans
and
which
divided
her
territory
into
two
distinct
portions
was
navigable
throughout
while
other
great
rivers
and
many
estuaries
leading
into
the
heart
of
her
dominions
formed
the
easiest
of
highways
for
the
advance
of
an
invading
army
very
early
had
her
fatal
weakness
been
detected
immediately
fort
sumter
fell
lincoln
had
taken
measures
to
isolate
the
seceding
states
to
close
every
channel
by
which
they
could
receive
either
succour
or
supplies
and
if
need
be
to
starve
them
into
submission
the
maritime
resources
of
the
union
were
so
large
that
the
navy
was
rapidly
expanded
numbers
of
trained
seamen
recruited
from
the
merchant
service
and
the
fisheries
were
at
once
available
the
northern
shipbuilders
had
long
been
famous
and
both
men
and
vessels
if
the
necessity
should
arise
might
be
procured
in
europe
judicious
indeed
was
the
policy
which
at
the
very
outset
of
the
war
brought
the
tremendous
pressure
of
the
to
bear
against
the
south
and
had
her
statesmen
possessed
the
knowledge
of
what
that
pressure
meant
they
must
have
realised
that
abraham
lincoln
was
no
ordinary
foe
in
forcing
the
confederates
to
become
the
aggressors
and
to
fire
on
the
national
ensign
he
had
created
a
united
north
in
establishing
a
blockade
of
their
coasts
he
brought
into
play
a
force
which
like
the
mills
of
god
grinds
slowly
but
grinds
exceeding
small
but
for
the
present
the
federal
navy
was
far
too
small
to
watch
three
thousand
miles
of
littoral
indented
by
spacious
harbours
and
secluded
bays
protected
in
many
cases
by
natural
breakwaters
and
communicating
by
numerous
channels
with
the
open
sea
moreover
it
was
still
an
even
chance
whether
cotton
became
a
source
of
weakness
to
the
confederacy
or
a
source
of
strength
if
the
markets
of
europe
were
closed
to
her
by
the
hostile
the
credit
of
the
young
republic
would
undoubtedly
be
seriously
impaired
but
the
majority
of
the
southern
politicians
believed
that
the
great
powers
beyond
the
atlantic
would
never
allow
the
north
to
enforce
her
restrictive
policy
england
and
france
a
large
portion
of
whose
population
depended
for
their
livelihood
on
the
harvests
of
the
south
were
especially
interested
and
england
and
france
both
great
maritime
states
were
not
likely
to
brook
interference
with
their
trade
nor
had
the
southern
people
a
high
opinion
of
northern
patriotism
they
could
hardly
conceive
that
the
maintenance
of
the
union
which
they
themselves
considered
so
light
a
bond
had
been
exalted
elsewhere
to
the
height
of
a
sacred
principle
least
of
all
did
they
believe
that
the
great
democratic
party
which
embraced
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
northern
people
and
which
for
so
many
years
had
been
in
close
sympathy
with
themselves
would
support
the
president
in
his
coercive
measures
history
moreover
not
always
an
infallible
guide
supplied
many
plausible
arguments
to
those
who
sought
to
forecast
the
immediate
future
in
the
war
of
independence
not
only
had
the
impracticable
nature
of
the
country
especially
of
the
south
baffled
the
armies
of
great
britain
but
the
european
powers
actuated
by
old
grudges
and
commercial
jealousy
had
come
to
the
aid
of
the
insurgents
on
a
theatre
of
war
where
trained
and
forces
had
failed
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
raw
levies
would
succeed
and
if
england
opposed
in
by
the
fleets
of
france
spain
and
holland
had
been
compelled
to
let
the
colonies
go
it
was
hardly
likely
that
the
north
confronted
by
the
naval
strength
of
england
and
france
would
long
maintain
the
struggle
with
the
south
trusting
then
to
foreign
intervention
to
the
dissensions
of
their
opponents
and
to
their
own
hardihood
and
unanimity
the
southerners
faced
the
future
with
few
misgivings
at
richmond
finding
himself
without
occupation
major
jackson
volunteered
to
assist
in
the
drilling
of
the
new
levies
the
duty
to
which
he
was
first
assigned
was
distasteful
he
was
an
indifferent
draughtsman
and
a
post
in
the
topographical
department
was
one
for
which
he
was
hardly
fitted
the
appointment
fortunately
was
not
confirmed
some
of
his
friends
in
the
confederate
congress
proposed
that
he
should
be
sent
to
command
at
harper
ferry
an
important
outpost
on
the
northern
frontier
of
virginia
there
was
some
opposition
not
personal
to
jackson
and
of
little
moment
but
it
called
forth
a
remark
that
shows
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
men
who
knew
him
who
is
this
major
jackson
it
was

the
reply
who
if
you

him
to
hold

never
leave
it
alive

be
occupied
by
the

harper

the

hear
from
me
very
often
as
i
expect
to
have
more
work
than
i
ever
had
in
the
same
length
of
time
before
but
do
be
concerned
about
your
husband
for
our
kind
heavenly
father
will
give
every
needful
aid
the
garrison
at
harper
ferry
consisted
of
a
large
number
of
independent
companies
of
infantry
a
few
light
companies
as
they
were
called
of
cavalry
and
fifteen
cannon
of
small
calibre
this
force
numbered
officers
and
men
of
whom
all
but
were
virginians
jackson
appearance
was
not
hailed
with
acclamation
the
officers
of
the
state
militia
had
hitherto
exercised
the
functions
of
command
over
the
concourse
of
enthusiastic
patriots
the
militia
however
was
hardly
more
than
a
force
on
paper
and
the
camps
swarmed
with
generals
and
who
were
merely
civilians
in
gaudy
uniform
by
order
of
the
state
legislature
these
gentlemen
were
now
deprived
of
their
fine
feathers
every
militia
officer
above
the
rank
of
captain
was
deposed
and
the
governor
of
virginia
was
authorised
to
fill
the
vacancies
this
measure
was
by
no
means
popular
both
by
officers
and
men
it
was
denounced
as
an
outrage
on
freemen
and
volunteers
and
the
companies
met
in
convention
for
the
purpose
of
passing
denunciatory
resolutions
their
new
commander
was
a
sorry
substitute
for
the
brilliant
figures
he
had
superseded
the
militia
generals
had
surrounded
themselves
with
a
numerous
staff
and
on
fine
afternoons
it
was
said
the
official
display
in
harper
ferry
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
the
jackson
had
but
two
assistants
who
like
himself
still
wore
the
plain
blue
uniform
of
the
military
institute
to
eyes
accustomed
to
the
splendid
trappings
and
prancing
steeds
of
his
predecessors
there
seemed
an
almost
painful
want
of
pomp
and
circumstance
about
the
colonel
of
volunteers
there
was
not
a
particle
of
gold
lace
about
him
he
rode
a
horse
as
quiet
as
himself
his
seat
in
the
saddle
was
ungraceful
his
cadet
cap
was
always
tilted
over
his
eyes
he
was
sparing
of
speech
his
voice
was
very
quiet
and
he
seldom
smiled
he
made
no
orations
he
held
no
reviews
and
his
orders
were
remarkable
for
their
brevity
even
with
his
officers
he
had
little
intercourse
he
confided
his
plans
to
no
one
and
not
a
single
item
of
information
useful
or
otherwise
escaped
his
lips
some
members
of
the
maryland
legislature
a
body
whom
it
was
important
to
conciliate
visited
harper
ferry
during
his
tenure
of
command
they
were
received
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
in
return
plied
the
general
with
many
questions
his
answers
were
unsatisfactory
and
at
length
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
asked
him
frankly
how
many
men
he
had
at
his
disposal
sir
was
the
reply
i
should
be
glad
if
president
lincoln
thought
i
had
fifty
thousand
nor
was
this
reticence
observed
only
towards
those
whose
discretion
he
mistrusted
he
was
silent
on
principle
in
the
campaign
of
the
distribution
of
the
french
troops
at
a
most
critical
moment
was
made
known
to
the
allies
by
the
capture
of
a
courier
carrying
a
letter
from
napoleon
to
the
empress
there
was
little
chance
of
a
letter
to
jackson
who
was
now
in
north
carolina
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
federals
but
even
in
so
small
a
matter
jackson
was
consistent
you
say
he
wrote
that
your
husband
never
writes
you
any
news
i
suppose
you
mean
military
news
for
i
have
written
you
a
great
deal
about
your
sposo
and
how
much
he
loves
you
what
do
you
want
with
military
news
do
you
know
that
it
is
unmilitary
and
unlike
an
officer
to
write
news
respecting
one
post
you
could
wish
your
husband
to
do
an
thing
could
you
and
then
the
claims
of
duty
being
thus
clearly
defined
he
proceeds
to
describe
the
roses
which
climbed
round
the
window
of
his
temporary
quarters
adding
with
that
devotion
which
every
letter
betrays
but
my
sweet
little
sunny
face
is
what
i
want
to
see
most
of
all
careful
as
he
was
to
keep
the
enemy
in
the
dark
he
was
exceedingly
particular
when
he
visited
his
distant
posts
on
the
potomac
that
his
presence
should
be
unobserved
had
it
become
known
to
the
federal
generals
that
the
commander
at
harper
ferry
had
reconnoitred
a
certain
point
of
passage
a
clue
might
have
been
given
to
his
designs
the
confederate
officers
therefore
in
charge
of
these
posts
were
told
that
colonel
jackson
did
not
wish
them
to
recognise
him
he
rode
out
accompanied
by
a
single
staff
officer
and
the
men
were
seldom
aware
that
the
brigadier
had
been
through
their
camps
never
was
a
commander
who
fell
so
far
short
of
the
popular
idea
of
a
dashing
leader
this
quiet
gentleman
who
came
and
went
unnoticed
who
had
nothing
to
say
and
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
observation
was
a
type
of
soldier
unfamiliar
to
the
volunteers
he
was
duty
personified
and
nothing
more
but
at
the
same
time
the
troops
instinctively
felt
that
this
absence
of
ostentation
meant
hard
work
they
began
to
realise
the
magnitude
of
the
obligations
they
had
assumed
soldiering
was
evidently
something
more
than
a
series
of
brilliant
spectacles
and
social
gatherings
here
was
a
man
in
earnest
who
looked
upon
war
as
a
serious
business
who
was
completely
oblivious
to
what
people
said
or
thought
and
his
example
was
not
without
effect
the
conventions
came
to
nothing
and
when
the
companies
were
organised
in
battalions
and
some
of
the
deposed
officers
were
reappointed
to
command
the
men
went
willingly
to
work
their
previous
knowledge
even
of
drill
was
of
the
scantiest
officers
and
men
had
to
begin
as
recruits
and
jackson
was
not
the
man
to
cut
short
essential
preliminaries
seven
hours
drill
daily
was
a
heavy
tax
upon
enthusiasm
but
it
was
severely
enforced
and
the
garrison
of
the
frontier
post
soon
learned
the
elements
of
manoeuvre
discipline
was
a
lesson
more
difficult
than
drill
the
military
code
in
all
its
rigour
could
not
be
at
once
applied
to
a
body
of
and
inexperienced
civilians
undue
severity
might
have
produced
the
very
worst
results
the
observance
therefore
of
those
regulations
which
were
not
in
themselves
essential
to
efficiency
or
health
was
not
insisted
on
lapses
in
military
etiquette
were
suffered
to
pass
unnoticed
no
attempt
was
made
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
between
officers
and
men
and
many
things
which
in
a
regular
army
would
be
considered
grossly
irregular
were
tacitly
permitted
jackson
was
well
aware
that
volunteers
of
the
type
he
commanded
needed
most
delicate
and
tactful
handling
the
chief
use
of
minute
regulations
and
exacting
routine
is
the
creation
of
the
instinct
of
obedience
time
was
wanting
to
instil
such
instinct
into
the
confederate
troops
and
the
intelligence
and
patriotism
of
the
men
largely
of
high
class
and
good
position
who
filled
the
ranks
might
be
relied
upon
to
prevent
serious
misconduct
had
they
been
burdened
with
the
constant
acknowledgment
of
superior
authority
which
becomes
a
second
nature
to
the
regular
soldier
disgust
and
discontent
might
have
taken
the
place
of
high
spirit
and
but
at
the
same
time
wilful
misbehaviour
was
severely
checked
neglect
of
duty
and
insubordination
were
crimes
which
jackson
never
forgave
and
deliberate
disobedience
was
in
his
eyes
as
unmanly
an
offence
as
cowardice
he
knew
when
to
be
firm
as
well
as
when
to
relax
and
it
was
not
only
in
the
administration
of
discipline
that
he
showed
his
tact
he
was
the
most
patient
of
instructors
so
long
as
those
under
him
were
trying
to
do
their
best
no
one
could
have
been
kinder
or
more
forbearing
and
he
constantly
urged
his
officers
to
come
to
his
tent
when
they
required
explanation
as
to
the
details
of
their
duty
besides
discipline
and
instruction
jackson
had
the
entire
administration
of
his
command
upon
his
hands
ammunition
was
exceedingly
scarce
and
he
had
to
provide
for
the
manufacture
of
transport
there
was
none
but
the
great
waggons
of
the
valley
farmers
supplied
the
deficiency
the
equipment
of
the
artillery
left
much
to
be
desired
and
ammunition
carts
or
caissons
were
constructed
by
fixing
roughly
made
chests
on
the
running
gear
of
waggons
the
supply
and
medical
services
were
and
everything
had
to
be
organised
de
novo
thus
the
officer
in
command
at
harper
ferry
had
his
hands
full
and
in
addition
to
his
administrative
labours
there
was
the
enemy
to
be
watched
information
to
be
obtained
and
measures
of
defence
to
be
considered
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
the
responsibilities
of
jackson
position
the
virginia
of
the
confederacy
was
cut
in
two
by
the
blue
ridge
a
chain
of
mountains
three
hundred
and
thirty
miles
in
length
which
rising
in
north
carolina
passes
under
different
names
through
maryland
pennsylvania
new
york
and
vermont
and
sinks
to
the
level
on
the
canadian
frontier
the
blue
ridge
varies
in
height
from
to
feet
densely
wooded
it
is
traversed
in
virginia
only
by
the
gaps
through
which
ran
three
railways
and
several
roads
these
gaps
were
of
great
strategic
importance
for
if
they
were
once
secured
a
northern
army
moving
up
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
would
find
a
covered
line
of
approach
towards
the
virginia
and
tennessee
railway
which
connected
richmond
with
the
mississippi
nor
was
this
the
only
advantage
it
would
gain
from
lexington
at
its
head
to
harper
ferry
where
it
strikes
the
potomac
throughout
its
whole
length
of
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
the
valley
was
rich
in
agricultural
produce
its
average
width
for
it
is
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
eastern
ranges
of
the
alleghanies
is
not
more
than
miles
but
there
are
few
districts
of
the
earth
surface
of
equal
extent
more
favoured
by
nature
or
more
highly
cultivated
it
was
the
granary
of
virginia
and
not
richmond
only
but
the
frontier
garrisons
depended
largely
for
subsistence
on
the
farms
of
the
shenandoah
moreover
if
the
valley
were
occupied
by
the
federals
virginia
would
be
cut
off
from
the
confederacy
and
jackson
native
mountains
inhabited
by
a
brave
and
hardy
race
would
be
lost
as
a
recruiting
ground
in
order
then
to
secure
the
loyalty
of
the
mountaineers
to
supply
the
armies
and
to
protect
the
railways
the
retention
of
the
valley
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
confederacy
the
key
of
the
communication
with
the
was
winchester
the
chief
town
of
the
lower
valley
miles
in
an
of
harper
ferry
from
winchester
two
highways
lead
westward
by
romney
and
moorefield
four
lead
east
and
crossing
the
blue
ridge
by
snicker
ashby
manassas
and
chester
gaps
and
the
first
object
of
the
confederate
force
at
harper
ferry
was
to
cover
this
nucleus
of
roads
during
the
month
of
may
the
garrison
of
the
frontier
post
was
undisturbed
by
the
enemy
lincoln
first
call
had
been
for
volunteers
on
may
he
asked
for
an
additional
these
when
trained
with
seamen
and
a
detachment
of
regulars
would
place
at
his
disposal
men
the
greater
part
of
this
force
had
assembled
at
washington
but
a
contingent
of
or
men
under
general
patterson
a
regular
officer
of
many
years
service
was
collecting
in
pennsylvania
and
an
outpost
of
men
was
established
at
chambersburg
miles
north
of
harper
ferry
these
troops
however
though
formidable
in
numbers
were
as
for
war
as
the
confederates
and
no
immediate
movement
was
to
be
anticipated
not
only
had
the
federal
authorities
to
equip
and
organise
their
levies
but
the
position
of
washington
was
the
cause
of
much
embarrassment
the
district
of
columbia
the
sixty
square
miles
set
apart
for
the
seat
of
the
federal
government
lies
on
the
potomac
fifty
miles
of
harper
ferry
wedged
in
between
virginia
on
the
one
side
and
maryland
on
the
other
the
loyalty
of
maryland
to
the
union
was
more
than
doubtful
as
a
state
her
sympathies
were
strongly
southern
and
it
was
only
her
geographical
situation
north
of
the
potomac
and
with
no
strong
frontier
to
protect
her
from
invasion
which
had
held
her
back
from
joining
the
confederacy
as
only
a
single
line
of
railway
connected
washington
with
the
north
passing
through
baltimore
the
chief
city
of
maryland
a
very
of
secession
sentiment
the
attitude
of
the
state
was
a
matter
of
the
utmost
anxiety
to
the
federal
government
an
attempt
to
send
troops
through
baltimore
to
washington
had
provoked
a
popular
commotion
and
some
bloodshed
stern
measures
had
been
necessary
to
keep
the
railway
open
baltimore
was
placed
under
martial
law
and
strongly
garrisoned
but
despite
these
precautions
for
some
weeks
the
feeling
in
maryland
was
so
hostile
to
the
union
that
it
was
not
considered
safe
for
the
northern
troops
to
cross
her
territory
except
in
large
numbers
and
the
concentration
at
washington
of
a
force
sufficient
to
defend
it
was
thus
attended
with
much
difficulty
a
single
railroad
too
the
baltimore
and
ohio
connected
washington
with
the
west
crossing
the
potomac
at
harper
ferry
and
following
the
course
of
the
river
it
ran
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
within
the
confines
of
virginia
thus
the
district
commanded
by
jackson
embraced
an
artery
of
supply
and
communication
which
was
of
great
importance
to
the
enemy
the
natural
course
would
have
been
to
destroy
the
line
at
once
but
the
susceptibilities
of
both
maryland
and
west
virginia
had
to
be
considered
the
stoppage
of
all
traffic
on
their
main
trade
route
would
have
done
much
to
alienate
the
people
from
the
south
and
there
was
still
hope
that
maryland
might
throw
in
her
lot
with
her
seceded
sisters
the
line
was
therefore
left
intact
and
the
company
was
permitted
to
maintain
the
regular
service
of
trains
including
the
mails
for
this
privilege
however
jackson
exacted
toll
the
confederate
railways
were
deficient
in
rolling
stock
and
he
determined
to
effect
a
large
transfer
from
the
baltimore
and
ohio
from
point
of
rocks
twelve
miles
east
of
harper
ferry
to
martinsburg
fifteen
miles
west
the
line
was
double
the
coal
traffic
along
it
says
general
imboden
was
immense
for
the
washington
government
was
accumulating
supplies
of
coal
on
the
seaboard
these
coal
trains
passed
harper
ferry
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
thus
furnished
jackson
with
a
pretext
for
arranging
a
brilliant
capture
a
detachment
was
posted
at
point
of
rocks
and
the
virginia
infantry
at
martinsburg
he
then
complained
to
the
president
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
that
the
night
trains
eastward
bound
disturbed
the
repose
of
his
camp
and
requested
a
change
of
schedule
that
would
pass
all
trains
by
harper
ferry
between
eleven
and
one
in
the
daytime
the
request
was
complied
with
and
thereafter
for
several
days
was
heard
the
constant
roar
of
passing
trains
for
an
hour
before
and
an
hour
after
noon
but
since
the
empties
were
sent
up
the
road
at
night
jackson
again
complained
that
the
nuisance
was
as
great
as
ever
and
as
the
road
had
two
tracks
said
he
must
insist
that
the
trains
should
pass
during
the
same
hour
as
those
going
east
again
he
was
obliged
and
we
then
had
for
two
hours
every
day
the
liveliest
railroad
in
america
one
night
as
soon
as
the
schedule
was
working
at
its
best
jackson
instructed
the
officer
commanding
at
point
of
rocks
to
take
a
force
of
men
across
to
the
maryland
side
of
the
river
the
next
day
at
eleven
and
letting
all
trains
pass
till
twelve
to
permit
none
to
go
east
he
ordered
the
reverse
to
be
done
at
martinsburg
thus
he
caught
all
the
trains
that
were
going
east
or
west
between
these
points
and
ran
them
up
to
winchester
miles
on
the
branch
line
whence
they
were
removed
by
horse
power
to
the
railway

strasburg

may
this
capture
was
jackson

exploit

in

at

on
may
he
was

johnston

of
the

of
his
letter
of
appointment
jackson
had
not
been
instructed
that
he
was
to
hand
over
his
command
and
strictly
conforming
to
the
regulations
he
respectfully
declined
to
vacate
his
post
fortunately
a
communication
soon
came
from
general
lee
commanding
the
virginia
troops
in
which
he
referred
to
johnston
as
in
command
at
harper
ferry
jackson
at
once
recognised
this
letter
as
official
evidence
that
he
was
superseded
and
from
that
time
forth
rendered
his
superior
the
most
faithful
and
zealous
support
he
seems
at
first
to
have
expected
that
he
would
be
sent
to
virginia
and
his
one
ambition
at
this
time
was
to
be
selected
as
the
instrument
of
saving
his
native
mountains
to
the
south
but
the
confederate
government
had
other
views
at
the
beginning
of
june
a
more
compact
organisation
was
given
to
the
regiments
at
harper
ferry
and
jackson
was
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
first
brigade
of
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
the
virginia
troops
were
merged
in
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
on
june
the
total
strength
was
men
and
guns
volume
page
recruited
in
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
and
the
western
mountains
the
brigade
consisted
of
the
following
regiments
the
virginia
colonel
allen
the
virginia
colonel
preston
the
virginia
colonel
harper
the
virginia
echols
the
virginia
colonel
cummings
a
battery
of
artillery
raised
in
rockbridge
county
was
attached
to
the
brigade
commanded
by
the
reverend
pendleton
the
rector
of
lexington
an
old
west
point
graduate
who
was
afterwards
distinguished
as
lee
chief
of
artillery
and
recruited
largely
from
theological
colleges
it
soon
became
peculiarly
efficient
when
the
battery
arrived
at
harper
ferry
it
was
quartered
in
a
church
already
occupied
by
a
company
called
the
grayson
who
wishing
to
show
their
hospitality
assigned
the
pulpit
to
captain
pendleton
as
an
appropriate
lodging
the
four
guns
were
at
once
christened
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
no
better
material
for
soldiers
ever
existed
than
the
men
of
the
valley
most
of
them
were
of
descent
but
from
the
more
northern
counties
came
many
of
english
blood
and
from
those
in
the
centre
of
swiss
and
german
but
whatever
their
origin
they
were
thoroughly
well
qualified
for
their
new
trade
all
classes
mingled
in
the
ranks
and
all
ages
the
heirs
of
the
oldest
families
and
the
humblest
of
the
sons
of
toil
boys
whom
it
was
impossible
to
keep
at
school
and
men
whose
white
beards
hung
below
their
youths
who
had
been
reared
in
luxury
and
rough
hunters
from
their
lonely
cabins
they
were
a
mountain
people
nurtured
in
a
wholesome
climate
bred
to
manly
sports
and
hardened
by
the
free
life
of
the
field
and
forest
to
social
distinctions
they
gave
little
heed
they
were
united
for
a
common
purpose
they
had
taken
arms
to
defend
virginia
and
to
maintain
her
rights
and
their
patriotism
was
proved
by
the
sacrifice
of
all
personal
consideration
and
individual
interest
nor
is
the
purity
of
their
motives
to
be
questioned
they
had
implicit
faith
in
the
righteousness
of
their
cause
were
few
in
the
valley
and
the
farms
were
tilled
mainly
by
free
labour
the
abolition
of
negro
servitude
would
have
affected
but
little
the
population
west
of
the
blue
ridge
but
nevertheless
west
of
the
blue
ridge
the
doctrine
of
state
rights
was
as
firmly
rooted
as
in
the
carolinas
the
idea
that
a
state
could
be
coerced
into
remaining
within
the
union
as
fiercely
repudiated
and
the
men
of
the
valley
faced
the
gathering
hosts
of
the
north
in
the
same
spirit
that
they
would
have
faced
the
hosts
of
a
foreign
foe
in
the
first
weeks
of
june
the
military
situation
became
more
threatening
the
union
armies
were
taking
shape
the
levies
of
volunteers
seemed
sufficiently
trained
to
render
reconquest
practicable
and
the
great
wave
of
invasion
had
already
mounted
the
horizon
a
force
of
men
based
on
the
ohio
threatened
virginia
there
had
been
collisions
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
where
the
federals
held
fortress
monroe
a
strong
citadel
within
eighty
miles
of
richmond
and
richmond
had
become
the
capital
of
the
confederacy
there
had
been
fighting
in
missouri
and
the
partisans
of
the
south
in
that
state
had
already
been
badly
worsted
the
vast
power
of
the
north
was
making
itself
felt
on
land
and
on
the
sea
had
asserted
an
ascendency
which
it
never
lost
the
blue
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
were
patrolled
by
a
fleet
with
which
the
confederates
had
no
means
of
coping
from
the
of
charleston
the
great
atlantic
port
of
the
south
the
masts
of
the
blockading
squadron
were
visible
in
the
offing
and
beyond
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi
closing
the
approaches
to
new
orleans
the
long
black
hulls
steamed
slowly
to
and
fro
but
it
was
about
manassas
junction
thirty
miles
of
washington
and
barring
the
road
to
richmond
that
all
interest
centred
during
the
first
campaign
here
was
posted
the
main
army
of
the
confederacy

under
general
beauregard
the
manassas
gap
railway
forming
an
easy
means
of
communication
with
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
johnston
force
had
been
gradually
increased
to
officers
and
men
but
the
general
was
by
no
means
convinced
of
the
desirability
of
holding
harper
ferry
the
place
itself
was
insignificant
it
had
contained
an
arsenal
but
this
had
been
burnt
by
the
federals
when
they
evacuated
the
post
and
it
was
absolutely
untenable
against
attack
to
the
east
runs
the
shenandoah

immediately
above
the
river

a
spur
of
the
blue
ridge
the

altitude
covered
with

undergrowth

name

the
maryland
heights
jackson
without
waiting
for
instructions
had
taken
on
himself
to
hold
and
fortify
the
maryland
heights
i
am
of
opinion
he
had
written
to
general
lee
that
this
place
should
be
defended
with
the
spirit
which
actuated
the
defenders
of
thermopylae
and
if
left
to
myself
such
is
my
determination
the
fall
of
this
place
would
i
fear
result
in
the
loss
of
the
part
of
the
state
and
who
can
estimate
the
moral
power
thus
gained
to
the
enemy
and
lost
to
ourselves
volume
page
lee
also
was
averse
to
evacuation
such
a
measure
he
said
would
be
depressing
to
the
cause
of
the
south
and
would
leave
maryland
isolated
the
post
it
was
true
could
be
easily
turned
by
crossing
the
potomac
at
williamsport
and
shepherdstown
twenty
and
ten
miles
respectively
the
federals
would
threaten
the
communications
of
the
garrison
with
winchester
in
case
they
were
attacked
the
confederates
would
have
to
fight
with
their
backs
to
the
shenandoah
broad
deep
and
unbridged
and
the
ground
westward
of
harper
ferry
was
ill
adapted
for
defence
attack
in
opinion
would
have
been
best
met
by
a
resolute
offensive
ibid
pages
johnston
however
believed
his
troops
unfitted
for
active
manoeuvres
and
he
was
permitted
to
choose
his
own
course
the
incident
is
of
small
importance
but
it
serves
to
show
an
identity
of
opinion
between
lee
and
jackson
and
a
regard
for
the
moral
aspect
of
the
situation
which
was
to
make
itself
manifest
with
extraordinary
results
at
a
later
period
june
on
june
johnston
destroyed
the
railway
bridge
over
the
potomac
removed
the
machinery
that
had
been
rescued
from
the
arsenal
burned
the
public
buildings
and
the
next
day
retired
on
winchester
his
immediate
opponent
general
patterson
had
crossed
the
pennsylvania
border
and
moving
through
maryland
had
occupied
williamsport
with
men
a
detachment
of
confederate
militia
had
been
driven
from
romney
miles
of
winchester
and
the
general
forward
movement
of
the
enemy
had
become
pronounced
june
on
june
jackson
brigade
was
ordered
to
destroy
the
workshops
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
at
martinsburg
together
with
the
whole
of
the
rolling
stock
that
might
there
be
found
and
to
support
the
cavalry
the
first
of
these
tasks
although
martinsburg
is
no
more
than
ten
miles
distant
from
williamsport
was
easily
accomplished
four
locomotives
were
sent
back
to
winchester
drawn
by
teams
of
horses
and
several
more
together
with
many
waggons
were
given
to
the
flames
the
second
task
demanded
no
unusual
exertions
the
federals
as
yet
manifested
no
intention
of
marching
upon
winchester
nor
was
the
confederate
cavalry
in
need
of
immediate
assistance
the
force
numbered
sabres
the
men
were
untrained
but
they
were
horsemen
they
knew
every
inch
of
the
country
and
they
were
exceedingly
well
commanded
stuart
who
had
been
a
captain
of
dragoons
in
the
united
states
army
had
already
given
token
of
those
remarkable
qualities
which
were
afterwards
to
make
him
famous
of
an
old
virginia
family
he
was
the
very
type
of
the
cavalier
fearless
and
untiring
boisterous
as
march
yet
fresh
as
may
educated
at
west
point
and
trained
in
indian
fighting
in
the
prairies
he
brought
to
the
great
struggle
upon
which
he
had
now
entered
a
thorough
knowledge
of
arms
a
bold
and
fertile
conception
and
a
constitution
of
body
which
enabled
him
to
bear
up
against
fatigues
which
would
have
prostrated
the
strength
of
other
men
those
who
saw
him
at
this
time
are
eloquent
in
their
description
of
the
energy
and
the
habits
of
the
man
they
tell
how
he
remained
almost
constantly
in
the
saddle
how
he
never
failed
to
instruct
personally
every
squad
which
went
out
on
picket
how
he
was
everywhere
present
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
along
the
line
which
he
guarded
and
how
by
infusing
into
the
raw
cavalry
his
own
activity
and
watchfulness
he
was
enabled
in
spite
of
the
small
force
which
he
commanded
to
observe
the
whole
part
of
the
potomac
from
point
of
rocks
to
beyond
williamsport
his
animal
spirits
were
unconquerable
his
gaiety
and
humour
unfailing
he
had
a
ready
jest
for
all
and
made
the
forests
ring
with
his
songs
as
he
marched
at
the
head
of
his
column
so
great
was
his
activity
that
general
johnston
compared
him
to
that
species
of
hornet
called
a
yellow
jacket
and
said
that
he
was
no
sooner
brushed
off
than
he
lit
back
again
when
the
general
was
subsequently
transferred
to
the
west
he
wrote
to
stuart
how
can
i
eat
sleep
or
rest
in
peace
without
you
upon
the
outpost
cooke
page
no
officer
in
the
confederacy
was
more
trusted
by
his
superiors
or
more
popular
with
the
men
and
jackson
was
no
more
proof
than
others
against
the
attractions
of
his
sunny
and
noble
nature
as
a
soldier
stuart
was
a
colleague
after
his
own
heart
and
as
a
man
he
was
hardly
less
congenial
the
dashing
horseman
of
who
rivalled
murat
in
his
fondness
for
gay
colours
and
to
all
appearance
looked
upon
war
as
a
delightful
frolic
held
a
rule
of
life
as
strict
as
that
of
his
presbyterian
comrade
and
outwardly
a
sharp
contrast
inwardly
they
were
in
the
closest
sympathy
stuart
fame
as
a
leader
was
to
be
won
in
larger
fields
than
those
west
of
the
blue
ridge
and
although
sprung
from
the
same
stock
he
was
in
no
way
connected
with
the
valley
soldiers
but
from
the
very
outbreak
of
the
war
he
was
intimately
associated
with
jackson
and
his
men
fortune
seemed
to
take
a
curious
delight
in
bringing
them
together
they
were
together
in
their
first
skirmish
and
in
their
last
great
victory
and
now
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
watching
the
hostile
masses
that
were
assembling
on
the
further
shore
they
first
learned
to
know
each
other
worth
july
on
july
patterson
crossed
the
river
the
movement
was
at
once
reported
by
stuart
and
jackson
with
the
virginia
and
a
battery
advanced
to
meet
the
enemy
his
instructions
from
johnston
were
to
ascertain
the
strength
of
the
hostile
force
and
then
to
retire
under
cover
of
the
cavalry
four
regiments
of
his
brigade
were
therefore
left
in
camp
the
baggage
was
sent
back
and
when
the
virginia
had
marched
out
a
short
distance
three
of
the
four
guns
were
halted
near
falling
waters
a
country
church
some
five
miles
south
of
the
potomac
patterson
advanced
guard
was
discovered
on
the
road
the
country
on
either
hand
like
the
greater
part
of
the
valley
was
open
undulating
and
highly
cultivated
view
and
movement
being
obstructed
only
by
rail
fences
and
patches
of
high
timber
the
virginians
were
partially
concealed
by
a
strip
of
woodland
and
when
the
federal
skirmishers
deployed
on
either
side
of
the
highway
moved
forward
to
the
attack
they
were
received
by
a
heavy
and
unexpected
fire
as
the
enemy
fell
back
a
portion
of
the
confederate
line
was
thrown
forward
occupying
a
house
and
barn
and
despite
the
fire
of
two
guns
which
the
federals
had
brought
up
the
men
with
the
impetuous
rashness
of
young
troops
dashed
out
to
the
attack
but
jackson
intervened
the
enemy
who
had
two
brigades
of
infantry
well
closed
up
was
deploying
a
heavy
force
his
skirmishers
were
again
advancing
and
the
virginia
in
danger
of
being
outflanked
was
ordered
to
retire
to
its
first
position
the
movement
was
misconstrued
by
the
federals
and
down
the
high
road
in
solid
column
came
the
pursuing
cavalry
a
shot
from
the
single
sufficed
to
check
their
progress
a
confused
mass
of
horsemen
went
flying
to
the
rear
and
the
confederate
gunners
turned
their
attention
to
the
hostile
battery
stuart
at
the
same
time
performed
a
notable
feat
he
had
moved
with
fifty
troopers
to
attack
the
enemy
right
flank
and
in
reconnoitring
through
the
woods
had
become
detached
for
the
moment
from
his
command
as
he
rode
along
a
winding
lane
he
saw
resting
in
a
field
a
company
of
federal
infantry
he
still
wore
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
army
the
enemy
suspected
nothing
taking
him
for
one
of
their
own
cavalry
and
he
determined
to
effect
their
capture
riding
up
to
the
fence
he
bade
one
of
the
men
remove
the
bars
this
was
done
with
respectful
alacrity
and
he
then
galloped
among
them
shouting
throw
down
your
arms
or
you
are
all
dead
men
the
stentorian
order
was
at
once
obeyed
the
raw
troops
not
only
dropped
their
rifles
but
fell
upon
their
faces
and
the
confederate
troopers
coming
to
their
aid
marched
the
whole
company
as
prisoners
to
the
rear
so
firm
was
the
attitude
of
jackson
command
that
general
patterson
was
thoroughly
imposed
upon
slowly
and
cautiously
he
pushed
out
right
and
left
and
it
was
not
till
near
noon
that
the
confederates
were
finally
ordered
to
retreat
beyond
desultory
skirmishing
there
was
no
further
fighting
the
virginia
fell
back
on
the
main
body
stuart
came
in
with
his
string
of
captives
and
leaving
the
cavalry
to
watch
the
enemy
the
first
brigade
went
into
camp
some
two
miles
south
of
martinsburg
patterson
reported
to
his
government
that
he
had
been
opposed
by
men
exactly
ten
times
jackson
actual
number
volume
page
the
losses
on
either
side
were
inconsiderable
a
few
men
killed
and
or
wounded
and
if
the
confederates
carried
off
prisoners
the
federals
had
the
satisfaction
of
burning
some
tents
which
jackson
had
been
unable
to
remove
the
engagement
however
had
the
best
effect
on
the
morale
of
the
southern
troops
and
they
were
not
so
ignorant
as
to
overlook
the
skill
and
coolness
with
which
they
had
been
manoeuvred
it
is
possible
that
their
commander
appeared
in
an
unexpected
light
and
that
they
had
watched
his
behaviour
with
some
amount
of
curiosity
they
certainly
discovered
that
a
distaste
for
show
and
frippery
is
no
indication
of
an
unwarlike
spirit
in
the
midst
of
the
action
while

writing

a

ball
had
torn

was
beyond
what
i
had
anticipated
as
i
only
expected
it
to
be
in
the
volunteer
forces
of
the
state
one
of
my
greatest
desires
for
advancement
is
the
gratification
it
will
give
my
darling

the
opportunity
of
serving
my
country
more
efficiently
i
have
had
all
that
i
ought
to
desire
in
the
line
of
promotion
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
if
i
were
not
contented
and
exceedingly
thankful
to
our
kind
heavenly
father
of
patterson
further
movements
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
at
length
the
federal
army
crawled
on
to
martinsburg
halting
seven
miles
jackson
was
reinforced
by
johnston
whole
command
and
here
for
four
days
the
confederates
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
awaited
attack
but
the
federals
stood
fast
in
martinsburg
and
on
the
fourth
day
johnston
withdrew
to
winchester
the
virginia
soldiers
were
bitterly
dissatisfied
at
first
even
jackson
chafed
he
was
eager
for
further
action
his
experiences
at
falling
waters
had
given
him
no
exalted
notion
of
the
enemy
prowess
and
he
was
ready
to
engage
them
i
want
my
brigade
he
said
to
feel
that
it
can
itself
whip
patterson
whole
army
and
i
believe
we
can
do
it
but
johnston
was
admirable
he
was
ready
to
receive
attack
believing
that
in
his
selected
position
he
could
repulse
superior
numbers
but
he
was
deaf
to
all
who
clamoured
for
an
offensive
movement
to
the
murmurs
of
the
men
and
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
officers
the
stone
houses
of
martinsburg
and
its
walled
inclosures
were
proof
against
assault
and
promised
at
most
a
bloody
victory
his
stock
of
ammunition
was
scanty
in
the
extreme
the
infantry
had
but
fourteen
cartridges
apiece
and
although
his
patience
was
construed
by
his
troops
as
a
want
of
enterprise
he
had
in
truth
displayed
great
daring
in
offering
battle
south
of
martinsburg
the
federal
army
at
washington
commanded
by
general
mcdowell
amounted
to
men
a
portion
of
this
force
was
already
south
of
the
potomac
and
beauregard
confederates
at
manassas
junction
were
seriously
threatened
in
west
virginia
the
enemy
had
advanced
moving
fortunately
in
the
direction
of
staunton
at
the
southern
end
of
the
valley
and
not
on
winchester
july
on
july
this
force
of
men
defeated
a
confederate
detachment
at
rich
mountain
not
far
from
jackson
birthplace
and
although
it
was
still
in
the
heart
of
the
alleghanies
a
few
marches
which
there
were
practically
no
troops
to
oppose
would
give
it
the
control
of
the
upper
valley
thus
menaced
by
three
columns
of
invasion
numbering
together
over
men
the
chances
of
the
confederates
who
mustered
no
more
than
all
told
looked
small
indeed
but
the
three
federal
columns
were
widely
separated
and
it
was
possible
by
means
of
the
manassas
gap
railway
for
johnston
and
beauregard
to
unite
with
greater
rapidity
than
their
opponents
president
davis
acting
on
the
advice
of
general
lee
had
therefore
determined
to
concentrate
the
whole
available
force
at
manassas
junction
and
to
meet
at
that
point
the
column
advancing
from
washington
volume
page
the
difficulty
was
for
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
to
give
patterson
the
slip
this
could
easily
have
been
done
while
that
officer
stood
fast
at
martinsburg
but
in
lee
opinion
if
the
enemy
found
that
the
whole
force
of
the
confederacy
was
concentrating
at
manassas
junction
the
washington
column
would
remain
within
its
intrenchments
round
the
capital
and
the
confederates
would
be
put
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
achieving
nothing
and
leaving
the
other
points
winchester
and
staunton
exposed
the
concentration
therefore
was
to
be
postponed
until
the
washington
column
advanced
volume
page
but
by
that
time
patterson
might
be
close
to
winchester
or
threatening
the
manassas
railway
johnston
had
thus
a
most
delicate
task
before
him
and
in
view
of
the
superior
numbers
which
the
federals
could
bring
against
manassas
it
was
essential
that
not
a
man
should
he
wasted
in
minor
enterprises
the
defeat
of
patterson
even
had
it
been
practicable
would
not
have
prevented
the
washington
column
from
advancing
and
every
confederate
rifleman
who
fell
in
the
valley
would
be
one
the
less
at
manassas
july
on
july
patterson
left
martinsburg
and
moved
in
the
direction
of
winchester
on
the
he
remained
halted
at
bunker
hill
nine
miles
north
and
on
the
instead
of
continuing
his
advance
moved
to
his
left
and
occupied
charlestown
his
indecision
was
manifest
he
too
had
no
easy
part
to
play
his
instructions
were
to
hold
johnston
in
the
valley
while
mcdowell
advanced
against
beauregard
but
his
instructions
were
either
too
definite
or
not
definite
enough
and
he
himself
was
overcautious
he
believed
and
so
did
general
scott
that
johnston
might
be
retained
at
winchester
by
demonstrations
that
is
by
making
a
show
of
strength
and
by
feigned
attacks
for
more
vigorous
action
patterson
was
not
in
the
least
inclined
and
we
can
hardly
wonder
if
he
hesitated
to
trust
his
regiments
to
the
confusion
and
chances
of
an
attack
even
in
that
day
of
raw
soldiers
and
inexperienced
leaders
his
troops
had
an
unenviable
reputation
they
had
enlisted
for
three
months
and
their
term
of
service
was
nearly
up
their
commander
had
no
influence
with
them
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
his
appeals
they
stubbornly
refused
to
remain
with
the
colours
even
for
a
few
days
over
their
term
of
service
they
were
possibly
disgusted
with
the
treatment
they
had
received
from
the
government
the
men
had
received
no
pay
many
were
without
shoes
and
others
according
to
their
general
were
without
pants
they
can
not
march
he
adds
and
unless
a
paymaster
goes
with
them
they
will
be
indecently
clad
and
have
just
cause
of
complaint
volume
pages
nevertheless
the
federal
authorities
made
a
grievous
mistake
when
they
allowed
patterson
and
his
to
move
to
charlestown
mcdowell
marched
against

the
afternoon

johnston
received
a
telegram

to
the
effect

was
advancing

was
immediately
directed
to
keep
patterson
amused
and
leaving
their
sick
in
number
to
the
care
of
winchester
the
troops
were
ordered
to
strike
tents
and
prepare
to
march
no
man
knew
the
object
of
the
movement
and
when
the
regiments
passed
through
winchester
marching
southward
with
their
backs
to
the
enemy
the
step
was
lagging
and
the
men
dispirited
a
few
miles
out
as
they
turned
eastward
the
brigades
were
halted
and
an
order
was
read
to
them
our
gallant
army
under
general
beauregard
is
now
attacked
by
overwhelming
numbers
the
commanding
general
hopes
that
his
troops
will
step
out
like
men
and
make
a
forced
march
to
save
the
country
the
effect
of
this
stirring
appeal
was
instantaneous
the
soldiers
says
jackson
rent
the
air
with
shouts
of
joy
and
all
was
eagerness
and
animation
the
march
was
resumed
and
as
mile
after
mile
was
passed
although
there
was
much
useless
delay
and
the
pace
was
slow
the
faint
outlines
of
the
blue
ridge
rising
high
above
the
valley
changed
imperceptibly
to
a
mighty
wall
of
rock
and
forest
as
the
night
came
down
a
long
reach
of
the
shenandoah
crossed
the
road
the
ford
was
but
the
tall
virginians
plunging
without
hesitation
into
the
strong
current
gained
the
opposite
shore
with
little
loss
of
time
the
guns
and
waggons
followed
in
long
succession
through
the
darkling
waters
and
still
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
toiling
column
passed
eastward
through
the
quiet
fields
the
blue
ridge
was
crossed
at
ashby
gap
and
at
two
in
the
morning
near
the
little
village
of
paris
the
first
brigade
was
halted
on
the
further
slope
they
had
marched
over
twenty
miles
and
so
great
was
their
exhaustion
that
the
men
sank
prostrate
on
the
ground
beside
their
muskets
the
discouragements
of
that
day
march
says
johnston
to
one
accustomed
to
the
steady
gait
of
regular
soldiers
is
indescribable
the
views
of
military
obedience
and
command
then
taken
both
by
officers
and
men
confined
their
duties
and
obligations
almost
exclusively
to
the
and
guards
in
camps
and
marches
they
were
scarcely
known
consequently
frequent
and
unreasonable
delays
caused
so
slow
a
rate
of
marching
as
to
make
me
despair
of
joining
general
beauregard
in
time
to
aid
him

and
precipitous
banks
from
two
to
three
miles
south
and
of
much
the

width
as
the
thames
at
oxford
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
attacked
on
the
morning
of
the
but
the
federal
commander
was
confronted
by
many
obstacles
he
knew
little
of
the
country
although
it
was
almost
within
sight
of
the
capital
the
maps
were
indifferent
guides
who
could
describe
roads
and
positions
from
a
military
point
of
view
were
not
forthcoming
all
information
had
to
be
procured
by
personal
reconnaissance
and
few
of
his
officers
had
been
trained
to
such
work
moreover
the
army
was
most
unwieldy
men
together
with
ten
batteries
and
the
requisite
train
of
waggons
was
a
force
far
larger
than
any
american
officer
had
yet
set
eyes
upon
and
the
movement
of
such
a
mass
demanded
precise
arrangement
on
the
part
of
the
staff
and
on
the
part
of
the
troops
most
careful
attention
to
order
and
punctuality
but
of
these
both
staff
and
troops
were
incapable
the
invading
force
might
have
done
well
in
a
defensive
position
which
it
would
have
had
time
to
occupy
and
where
the
supply
of
food
and
forage
carried
on
from
stationary
magazines
would
have
been
comparatively
easy
but
directly
it
was
put
in
motion
inexperience
and
indiscipline
stood
like
giants
in
the
path
the
federal
troops
were
utterly
unfitted
for
offensive
movement
and
both
scott
and
mcdowell
had
protested
against
an
immediate
advance
the
regiments
had
only
been
organised
in
brigades
a
week
previously
they
had
never
been
exercised
in
mass
deployment
for
battle
had
not
yet
been
practised
and
to
deploy
or
men
for
attack
is
a
difficult
operation
even
with
troops
and
an
experienced
staff
nor
were
the
supply
arrangements
yet
completed
the
full
complement
of
waggons
had
not
arrived
and
the
drivers
on
the
spot
were
as
ignorant
as
they
were
insubordinate
the
troops
had
received
no
instruction
in
musketry
and
many
of
the
regiments
went
into
action
without
having
once
fired
their
rifles
but
the
protests
of
the
generals
were
of
no
effect
the
federal
cabinet
decided
that
in
face
of
the
public
impatience
it
was
impossible
to
postpone
the
movement
on
to
richmond
was
the
universal
cry
the
halls
of
congress
resounded
with
the
fervid
eloquence
of
the
politicians
the
press
teemed
with
bombastic
articles
in
which
the
northern
troops
were
favourably
compared
with
the
regular
armies
of
europe
and
the
need
of
discipline
and
training
for
the
fearless
and
intelligent
representatives
of
the
sovereign
people
was
scornfully
repudiated
ignorance
of
war
and
contempt
for
the
lessons
of
history
were
to
cost
the
nation
dear
the
march
from
washington
was
a
brilliant
spectacle
the
roads
south
of
the
potomac
were
covered
with
masses
of
men
well
armed
and
well
clothed
amply
furnished
with
artillery
and
led
by
regular
officers
to
the
sound
of
martial
music
they
had
defiled
before
the
president
they
were
accompanied
by
scores
of
carriages
senators
members
of
congress
and
even
ladies
swelled
the
long
procession
a
crowd
of
reporters
rode
beside
the
columns
and
the
return
of
a
victorious
army
could
hardly
have
been
hailed
with
more
enthusiasm
than
the
departure
of
these
untrained
and
unblooded
volunteers
yet
pitiful
masquerade
as
the
march
must
have
appeared
to
a
soldier
eye
the
majority
of
those
who
broke
camp
that
summer
morning
were
brave
men
and
good
americans
to
restore
the
union
to
avenge
the
insult
to
their
country
flag

had
come
forward
with
no
other
compulsion
than
the
love
of
their
if
their
was
supreme
and
even
arrogant
it
was
the
of
a
strong
and
a
fearless
people
and
their
patriotism
was
of
the
loftiest
kind
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
north
with
her
enormous
wealth
to
have
organised
a
vast
army
of
mercenaries
wherewith
to
crush
the
south
but
no
her
sons
were
not
willing
that
their
country
honour
should
be
committed
to
meaner
hands
as
they
advanced
into
virginia
the
men
animated
by
their
surroundings
stepped
briskly
forward

the
was
gay
with
fantastic
uniforms
and
gorgeous
standards
but
the
heat
was
oppressive
and
the
roads
lay
deep
in
dust
knapsack
rifle
and
blankets
became
a
grievous
burden
the
excitement
died
away
and
unbroken
to
the
monotonous
exertion
of
the
march
the
recruits
lost
all
semblance
of
subordination
the

gradually
lost

increasing

two

were
withdrawn

the
attacking
troops
reached
the

suddenly
from
the
high
timber
on
the
further
bank
volleys
of
musketry
blazed
out
in
their
very
faces
and
then
came
proof
that
some
at
least
of
the
federal
regiments
were
no
more
to
be
relied
upon
in
action
than
on
the
march
a
portion
of
the
force
despite
the
strong
position
of
the
enemy
and
the
heavy
fire
showed
a
bold
front
but
at
least
one
regiment
turned
and
fled
and
was
only
rallied
far
in
rear
the
whole
affair
was
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
commander
his
troops
had
been
heedlessly
pushed
forward
and
general
longstreet
commanding
the
opposing
brigade
by
carefully
concealing
his
infantry
had
drawn
him
into
an
ambuscade
the
results
of
the
action
were
not
without
importance
the
federals
fell
back
with
a
loss
of
officers
and
men
and
the
confederates
were
much
elated
at
their
easy
success
among
some
of
the
northerners
on
the
other
hand
the
sudden
check
to
the
advance
and
the
bold
bearing
of
the
enemy
turned
confidence
and
enthusiasm
into
irrational
despondency
a
regiment
and
a
battery
which
had
enlisted
for
three
months
and
whose
time
was
up
demanded
their
discharge

notwithstanding
the
appeals
of

plans
were
affected

the
behaviour
of

he
was
still
ignorant
so
skilfully
had
the
march
from

been
carried
out
that
johnston
had
escaped
patterson
he
was
well
aware
however
that

movement
was
within

bounds

yet
he
found
himself
compelled
to
postpone
attack
until
the
the

were
spent
in
reconnaissance
and
in
bringing
up
supplies
and
the
lack
of
organisation
made
the
issue
of

a
long
process
but
it
was
the
general
want
of

was

turn

however
on
this
flank
was
found
to

unfit
for

masses
and
it
was
consequently
determined
to
turn
the
confederate
left

the
federal
army
consisted
of
five
divisions

that
could
be
found
he
had
not
gone
forward
to

exposed
the

nothing
more
than
a
cottage
neither
here

elsewhere
was
there
shelter
for
his

they
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
full

without
power
of
reply
but
on
the
eastern
edge
of

affording
excellent
cover

merged
into
a
dense
oak

where
the

were

gathering
was
wholly
unseen
but
as
the
tactics
of
wellington
so
often
proved
a
position
from
which
the
view
is
limited

of

line
may
be
exceedingly
strong
for
defence
provided
that
troops
who
hold

can
use

it
would
be
difficult
in
the
extreme
for
the
federals
to
pave
the
way
for
their
attack
with
artillery
from
the
guns
on
the
matthews
hill
the
virginia
regiments
were
well
sheltered
and
the
range
was
long
to
do
effective
work
the
hostile
batteries
would
have
to
cross
young
branch
ascend
the
henry
hill
and
come
into
action
within
five
hundred
yards
of
jackson
line
even
if
they
were
able
to
hold
their
ground
at
so
short
a
range
they
could
make
no
accurate
practice
under
the
fire
of
the
confederate
marksmen
noon
in
rear
of
jackson
line
bee
bartow
and
evans
were
rallying
their
men
when
johnston
and
beauregard
compelled
by
the
unexpected
movement
of
the
federals
to
abandon
all
idea
of
attack
appeared
upon
the
henry
hill
they
were
accompanied
by
two
batteries
of
artillery
pendleton
and
alburtis
the
colours
of
the
broken
regiments
were
ordered
to
the
front
and
the
men
rallied
taking
post
on
jackson
right
the
moment
was
critical
the
blue
masses
of
the
federals
the
dust
rolling
high
above
them
were
already
descending
the
opposite
slopes
the
guns
flashed
fiercely
through
the
yellow
cloud
and
the
confederate
force
was
but
a
handful
three
brigades
had
been
summoned
from
the
fords
but
the
nearest
was
four
miles
distant
and
many
of
the
troops
upon
the
plateau
were
already
by
retreat
the
generals
set
themselves
to
revive
the
courage
of
their
soldiers
beauregard
galloped
along
the
line
cheering
the
regiments
in
every
portion
of
the
field
and
then
with
the
accompanying
him
rode
forward
to
the
crest
johnston
was
equally
conspicuous
the
enemy
shells
were
bursting
on
every
side
and
the
shouts
of
the
confederates
recognising
their
leaders
as
they
dashed
across
the
front
redoubled
the
uproar
meanwhile
before
the
centre
of
his
line
with
an
unconcern
which
had
a
marvellous
effect
on
his
untried
command
jackson
rode
slowly
to
and
fro
except
that
his
face
was
a
little
paler
and
his
eyes
brighter
he
looked
exactly
as
his
men
had
seen
him
so
often
on
parade
and
as
he
passed
along
the
crest
above
them
they
heard
from
time
to
time
the
reassuring
words
uttered
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
no
trace
of
excitement
steady
men
steady
all
well
it
was
at
this
juncture
while
the
confusion
of
taking
up
a
new
position
with
shattered
and
troops
was
at
the
highest
that
the
battle
lulled
the
federal
infantry
after
defeating
bee
and
evans
had
to
cross
the
deep
gully
and
marshy
banks
of
branch
to
climb
the
slope
of
the
henry
hill
and
to
form
for
a
fresh
attack
even
with
trained
soldiers
a
hot
fight
is
so
conducive
of
disorder
that
it
is
difficult
to
initiate
a
rapid
pursuit
and
the
northern
regiments
were
very
slow
in
resuming
their
formations
at
the
same
time
too
the
fire
of
their
batteries
became
less
heavy
from
their
position
beyond
young
branch
the
rifled
guns
had
been
able
to
ply
the
confederate
lines
with
shell
and
their
effective
practice
had
rendered
the
work
of
rallying
the
troops
exceedingly
difficult
but
when
his
infantry
advanced
mcdowell
ordered
one
half
of
his
artillery
two
fine
batteries
of
regulars
made
up
principally
of
rifled
guns
to
cross
young
branch
this
respite
was
of
the
utmost
value
to
the
confederates
the
men
encouraged
by
the
gallant
bearing
of
their
leaders
fell
in
at
once
upon
the
colours
and
when
hunter
regiments
appeared
on
the
further
rim
of
the
plateau
they
were
received
with
a
fire
which
for
a
moment
drove
them
back
but
the
regular
batteries
were
close
at
hand
and
as
they
came
into
action
the
battle
became
general
on
the
henry
hill
the
federals
had
infantry
available
the
confederates
no
more
than
but
the
latter
were
superior
in
artillery
pieces
confronting
the
federal
guns
however
were
of
heavier
calibre
the
gunners
were
old
soldiers
and
both
friend
and
foe
testify
to
the
accuracy
of
their
fire
their
fine
discipline
and
staunch
endurance
the
infantry
on
the
other
hand
was
not
well
handled
the
attack
was
purely
frontal
no
attempt
whatever
was
made
to
turn
the
confederate
flanks
although
the
stone
bridge
except
for
the
abattis
was
now
open
and
johnston
line
might
easily
have
been
taken
in
reverse
nor
does
it
appear
that
the
cavalry
was
employed
to
ascertain
where
the
flanks
rested
moreover
instead
of
massing
the
troops
for
a
determined
onslaught
driven
home
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
the
attack
was
made
by
successive
brigades
those
in
rear
waiting
till
those
in
front
had
been
defeated
and
in
the
same
manner
the
brigades
attacked
by
successive
regiments
such
tactics
were
inexcusable
it
was
certainly
necessary
to
push
the
attack
home
before
the
confederate
reinforcements
could
get
up
and
troops
who
had
never
drilled
in
mass
would
have
taken
much
time
to
assume
the
orthodox
formation
of
several
lines
of
battle
closely
supporting
one
another
yet
there
was
no
valid
reason
beyond
the
inexperience
of
the
generals
in
dealing
with
large
bodies
that
brigades
should
have
been
sent
into
action
piecemeal
or
that
the
flanks
of
the
defence
should
have
been
neglected
the
fighting
nevertheless
was
fierce
the
federal
regiments
inspirited
by
their
success
on
the
matthews
hill
advanced
with
confidence
and
soon
pushed
forward
past
the
henry
house
the
contest
that
ensued
says
general
imboden
was
terrific
jackson
ordered
me
to
go
from
battery
to
battery
and
see
that
the
guns
were
properly
aimed
and
the
fuses
cut
the
right
length
this
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
minutes
on
returning
to
the
left
of
the
line
of
guns
i
stopped
to
ask
general
jackson
permission
to
rejoin
my
battery
the
fight
was
just
then
hot
enough
to
make
him
feel
well
his
eyes
fairly
blazed
he
had
a
way
of
throwing
up
his
left
hand
with
the
open
palm
towards
the
person
he
was
addressing
and
as
he
told
me
to
go
he
made
this
gesture
the
air
was
full
of
flying
missiles
and
as
he
spoke
he
jerked
down
his
hand
and
i
saw
that
blood
was
streaming
from
it
i
exclaimed
general
you
are
wounded
only
a
scratch
a
mere
scratch
he
replied
and
binding
it
hastily
with
a
handkerchief
he
galloped
away

his

was
at

not

the

thundered
and
the

the

the

guarding

eagerly
awaiting
his

now
with
troopers
filing
through

at

the

charged
forward
from
the
copse
in
which
they
had
been
hidden
the
uniforms
in
the
two
armies
at
this
time
were
much
alike
and
from
the
direction
of
their
approach
it
was
difficult
at
first
for
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
federal
batteries
to
make
sure
that
the
advancing
troops
were
not
their
own
a
moment
more
and
the
doubtful
regiment
proved
its
identity
by
a
deadly
volley
delivered
at
a
range
of
seventy
yards
every
gunner
was
shot
down
the
teams
were
almost
annihilated
and
several

although

seemed
desperate
in

the
crisis
of

mcdowell
had
but
two
brigades
remaining
in

one
of
these
of
tyler

was
still
beyond

his
troops
were
thoroughly
exhausted

had
been
marching

had
encountered

by
johnston
to
turn
the

right
but
before
the
weight
of

bayonets
could
be

into

the
federals
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
carry

were
beginning
to

lying
beneath

of

had

yet

engaged
in

still
held
their
own
riding
to

the
hot
virginian

respond

with
the
crash

cries
of
battle
in
their

recumbent

let
loose
and
before
long
the
retreat
became
a
panic
the

battalion
composed
of

soldiers

led
by
experienced
officers
alone
preserved
its
discipline
moving
steadily

and
checking

pursuing

by
its
firm
and
confident
bearing
the
remainder
of
the
army
dissolved
into
a
mob
it
was
not
that
the
men
were
completely
demoralised
but
simply
that
discipline
had
not
become
a
habit
they
had
marched
as
individuals
going
just
so
far
as
they
pleased
and
halting
when
they
pleased
they
had
fought
as
individuals
bravely
enough
but
with
little
combination
and
when
they
found
that
they
were
beaten
as
individuals
they
retreated

never

this

no

men

mingled
together
promiscuously
and
it
is
worthy
of

that

says

the

quietly

that
arising
from
the
frantic

in
the
day
had
prevented
an
advance
on
centreville
by
the
confederate
right
brought
johnston
arrangements
for
pursuit
to
naught
the
cavalry
weak
in
numbers
was
soon
incumbered
with
squads
of
prisoners
darkness
fell
upon
the
field
and
the
defeated
army
streamed
over
the
roads
to
washington
followed
only
by
its
own
fears
why
the
confederate
generals
did
not
follow
up
their
success
on
the
following
day
is
a
question
round
which
controversy
raged
for
many
a
year
deficiencies
in
commissariat
and
transport
the
disorganisation
of
the
army
after
the
victory
the
difficulties
of
a
direct
attack
upon
washington
defended
as
it
was
by
a
river
a
mile
broad
with
but
a
single
bridge
and
patrolled
by
gunboats
the
determination
of
the
government
to
limit
its
military
operations
to
a
passive
defence
of
confederate
territory
have
all
been
pressed
into
service
as
excuses
give
me
fresh
troops
said
jackson
as
the
surgeon
dressed
his
wound
and
i
would
be
in
washington
before
hours
had
passed
reinforcements
had
increased
the
strength
of
johnston
army
to
want
of
organisation
had
undoubtedly
prevented
mcdowell
from
winning
a
victory
on
the
or
but
pursuit
is
a
far
less
difficult
business
than
attack
there
was
nothing
to
interfere
with
a
forward
movement
there
were
supplies
along
the
railway
and
if
the
mechanism
for
their
distribution
and
the
means
for
their
carriage
were
wanting
the
counties
adjoining
the
potomac
were
rich
and
fertile
herds
of
bullocks
were
grazing
in
the
pastures
and
the
barns
of
the
farmers
were
loaded
with
grain
it
was
not
a
long
supply
train
that
was
lacking
nor
an
experienced
staff
nor
even
battalions
but
a
general
who
grasped
the
full
meaning
of
victory
who
understood
how
a
defeated
army
more
especially
of
new
troops
yields
at
a
touch
and
who
above
all
saw
the
necessity
of
giving
the
north
no
leisure
to
develop
her
immense
resources
for
three
days
jackson
impatiently
awaited
the
order
to
advance
and
his
men
were
held
ready
with
three
days
cooked
rations
in
their
haversacks
but
his
superiors
gave
no
sign
and
he
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
abandon
all
hope
of
reaping
the
fruits
of
victory
it
is
true
that
the
confederates
were
no
more
fit
for
offensive
operations
than
mcdowell
troops
our
army
says
general
johnston
was
more
disorganised
by
victory
than
that
of
the
united
states
by
defeat
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
if
the
southerners
had
moved
into
maryland
crossing
the
potomac
by
some
of
the
numerous
fords
near
harper
ferry
they
would
have
found
no
organised
opposition
save
the
debris
of
mcdowell
army
between
them
and
the
northern
capital
on
july
five
days
after
the
battle
the
general
who
was
to
succeed
mcdowell
arrived
in
washington
and
rode
round
the
city
i
found
he
wrote
no
preparations
whatever
for
defence
not
even
to
the
extent
of
putting
the
troops
in
military
position
not
a
regiment
was
properly
encamped
not
a
single
avenue
of
approach
guarded
all
was
chaos
and
the
streets
hotels
and
were
filled
with
drunken
officers
and
men
absent
from
their
regiments
without
leave
a
perfect
pandemonium
many
had
even
gone
to
their
homes
their
flight
from
bull
run
terminating
in
new
york
or
even
in
new
hampshire
and
maine
there
was
really
nothing
to
prevent
a
small
cavalry
force
from
riding
into
the
city
a
determined
attack
would
doubtless
have
carried
arlington
heights
and
placed
the
city
at
the
mercy
of
a
battery
of
rifled
guns
if
the
secessionists
attached
any
value
to
the
possession
of
washington
they
committed
their
greatest
error
in
not
following
up
the
victory
of
bull
run
on
the
same
date
the
secretary
of
war
stanton
wrote
as
follows
the
capture
of
washington
seems
now
to
be
inevitable
during
the
whole
of
monday
and
tuesday
july
and
it
might
have
been
taken
without
resistance
the
rout
overthrow
and
demoralisation
of
the
whole
army
were
complete
mcclellan
own
story
pages
and
of
his
own
share
in
the
battle
either
at
the
time
or
afterwards
jackson
said
but
little
a
day
or
two
after
the
battle
an
anxious
crowd
was
gathered
round
the
at
lexington
awaiting
intelligence
from
the
front
a
letter
was
handed
to
the
reverend
white
who
recognising
the
handwriting
exclaimed
to
the
eager
groups
about
him
now
we
shall
know
all
the
facts
on
opening
it
he
found
the
following
and
no
more
my
dear
pastor
in
my
tent
last
night
after
a
fatiguing
day
service
i
remembered
that
i
had
failed
to
send
you
my
contribution
to
our
coloured
sunday
school
enclosed
you
will
find
my
check
for
that
object
which
please
acknowledge
at
your
earliest
convenience
and
oblige
yours
faithfully
jackson
to
his
wife
however
he
was
less
reserved
yesterday
he
wrote
we
fought
a
great
battle
and
gained
a
great
victory
for
which
all
the
glory
is
due
to
god
alone
whilst
great
credit
is
due
to
other
parts
of
our
gallant
army
god
made
my
brigade
more
instrumental
than
any
other
in
repulsing
the
main
attack
this
is
for
your
information
only
say
nothing
about
it
let
others
speak
praise
not
myself
again
on
august
and
so
you
think
the
papers
ought
to
say
more
about
your
husband
my
brigade
is
not
a
brigade
of
newspaper
correspondents
i
know
that
the
first
brigade
was
the
first
to
meet
and
pass
our
retreating
forces
to
push
on
with
no
other
aid
than
the
smiles
of
god
to
boldly
take
up
its
position
with
the
artillery
that
was
under
my
command
to
arrest
the
victorious
foe
in
his
onward
progress
to
hold
him
in
check
until
the
reinforcements
arrived
and
finally
to
charge
bayonets
and
thus
advancing
to
pierce
the
enemy
centre
i
am
well
satisfied
with
what
it
did
and
so
are
my
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
i
should
receive
the
credit
that
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
would
because
i
was
under
them
but
i
am
thankful
to
my
heavenly
father
that
he
makes
me
content
to
await
his
own
good
time
and
pleasure
for
commendation
knowing
that
all
things
work
together
for
my
good
if
my
brigade
can
always
play
so
important
and
useful
a
part
as
it
did
in
the
last
battle
i
trust
i
shall
ever
be
most
grateful
as
you
think
the
papers
do
not
notice
me
enough
i
send
a
specimen
which
you
will
see
from
the
upper
part
of
the
paper
is
a
my
darling
never
distrust
our
god
who
doeth
all
things
well
in
due
time
he
will
make
manifest
all
his
pleasure
which
is
all
his
people
should
desire
you
must
not
be
concerned
at
seeing
other
parts
of
the
army
lauded
and
my
brigade
not
mentioned
truth
is
mighty
and
will
prevail
when
the
official
reports
are
published
if
not
before
i
expect
to
see
justice
done
to
this
noble
body
of
patriots
both
johnston
and
beauregard
in
their
official
reports
did
full
justice
to
jackson
and
his
brigade
these
letters
reveal
a
generous
pride
in
the
valour
of
his
troops
and
a
very
human
love
of
approbation
struggles
with
the
curb
which
his
religious
principles
had
placed
on
his
ambition
like
nelson
he
felt
perhaps
that
before
long
he
would
have
a
gazette
of
his
own
but
still
of
his
own
achievements
of
his
skilful
tactics
of
his
personal
behaviour
of
his
orders
he
spoke
no
word
and
the
victory
was
ascribed
to
a
higher
power
the
charge
of
the
and
virginia
he
wrote
in
his
modest
report
through
the
blessing
of
god
who
gave
us
the
victory
pierced
the
centre
of
the
enemy
volume
page
and
jackson
attitude
was
that
of
the
southern
people
when
the
news
of
bull
run
reached
richmond
and
through
the
crowds
that
thronged
the
streets
passed
the
tidings
of
the
victory
there
was
neither
wild
excitement
nor
uproarious
joy
no
bonfires
lit
the
darkness
of
the
night
no
cannon
thundered
out
salutes
the
steeples
were
silent
till
the
morrow
and
then
were
heard
only
the
solemn
tones
that
called
the
people
to
prayer
it
was
resolved
on
the
day
following
the
battle
by
the
confederate
congress
that
we
recognise
the
hand
of
the
most
high
god
the
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
in
the
glorious
victory
with
which
he
has
crowned
our
arms
at
manassas
and
that
the
people
of
these
confederate
states
are
invited
by
appropriate
services
on
the
ensuing
sabbath
to
offer
up
their
united
thanksgivings
and
prayers
for
this
mighty
deliverance
the
spoils
of
bull
run
were
large
prisoners
guns
ten
stand
of
colours
several
thousand
rifles
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
and
hospital
stores
waggons
and
several
ambulances
were
left
in
the
victors
hands
the
federal
losses
were
killed
and
wounded
the
confederate
killed
wounded
and
missing
the
first
brigade
suffered
more
severely
than
any
other
in
the
southern
army
of
officers
and
men
were
killed
or
wounded
nearly
a
fourth
of
the
total
loss
a
few
days
after
the
battle
johnston
advanced
to
centreville
and
from
the
heights
above
the
broad
potomac
his
cavalry
vedettes
looked
upon
the
spires
of
washington
but
it
was
in
vain
that
the
confederate
troopers
rode
to
and
fro
on
the
river
bank
and
watered
their
horses
within
sight
of
the
capitol
the
enemy
was
not
to
be
beguiled
across
the
protecting
stream
but
it
was
not
from
fear
although
the
disaster
had
been
as
crushing
as
unexpected
it
was
bravely
met
the
president
demand
for
another
army
was
cheerfully
complied
with
volunteers
poured
in
from
every
state
the
men
were
no
longer
asked
to
serve
for
three
months
but
for
three
years
washington
became
transformed
into
an
enormous
camp
great
earthworks
rose
on
the
surrounding
heights
and
the
training
of
the
new
levies
went
steadily
forward
there
was
no
cry
for
immediate
action
men
were
not
wanting
who
believed
that
the
task
of
coercion
was
impossible
able
statesmen
and
influential
journalists
advised
the
president
to
abandon
the
attempt
but
lincoln
true
to
the
trust
which
had
been
committed
to
his
keeping
never
flinched
from
his
resolve
that
the
union
should
be
restored
he
too
stood
like
a
wall
between
his
defeated
legions
and
the
victorious
foe
nor
was
the
nation
less
determined
the
dregs
of
humiliation
had
been
drained
and
though
the
draught
was
bitter
it
was
salutary
the
president
was
sustained
with
no
loyalty
his
political
opponents
raved
and
threatened
but
under
the
storm
of
recrimination
the
work
of
reorganising
the
army
went
steadily
forward
and
the
people
were
content
that
until
the
generals
declared
the
army
fit
for
action
the
hour
of
vengeance
should
be
postponed
to
the
south
bull
run
was
a
pyrrhic
victory
it
relieved
virginia
of
the
pressure
of
the
invasion
it
proved
to
the
world
that
the
attitude
of
the
confederacy
was
something
more
than
the
reckless
revolt
of
a
small
section
but
it
led
the
government
to
indulge
vain
hopes
of
foreign
intervention
and
it
increased
the
universal
contempt
for
the
military
qualities
of
the
northern
soldiers
the
hasty
judgment
of
the
people
construed
a
single
victory
as
proof
of
their
superior
capacity
for
war
and
the
defeat
of
mcdowell
army
was
attributed
to
the
cowardice
of
his
volunteers
the
opinion
was
absolutely
erroneous
some
of
the
federal
regiments
had
misbehaved
it
is
true
seized
with
sudden
panic
to
which
all
raw
troops
are
peculiarly
susceptible
they
had
dispersed
before
the
strong
counterstroke
of
the
confederates
but
the
majority
had
displayed
a
sterling
courage
there
can
be
little
question
that
the
spirit
of
the
infantry
depends
greatly
on
the
staunchness
of
the
artillery
a
single
battery
pushed
boldly
forward
into
the
front
of
battle
has
often
restored
the
vigour
of
a
wavering
line
although
the
losses
it
inflicts
may
not
be
large
the
moral
effect
of
its
support
is
undeniable
so
long
as
the
guns
hold
fast
victory
seems
possible
but
when
these
useful
auxiliaries
are
driven
back
or
captured
a
general
depression
becomes
inevitable
the
retreat
of
the
artillery
strikes
a
chill
into
the
fighting
line
which
is
ominous
of
defeat
and
it
is
a
wise
regulation
that
compels
the
batteries
even
when
their
ammunition
is
exhausted
to
stand
their
ground
the
federal
infantry
at
bull
run
had
seen
their
artillery
overwhelmed
the
teams
destroyed
the
gunners
shot
down
and
the
enemy
riflemen
swarming
amongst
the
abandoned
pieces
but
so
vigorous
had
been
their
efforts
to
restore
the
battle
that
the
front
of
the
defence
had
been
with
difficulty
maintained
the
guns
though
they
were
eventually
lost
had
been
retaken
and
without
the
assistance
of
their
artillery
but
exposed
to
the
fire
at
closest
range
of
more
than
one
battery
the
northern
regiments
had
boldly
pushed
forward
across
the
henry
hill
the
confederates
during
the
greater
part
of
the
battle
were
certainly
outnumbered
but
at
the
close
they
were
the
stronger
and
the
piecemeal
attacks
of
the
federals
neutralised
the
superiority
which
the
invading
army
originally
possessed
mcdowell
appears
to
have
employed
troops
in
the
attack
johnston
and
beauregard
about
the
same
number
for
the
strength
of
divisions
and
brigades
see
the
note
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
a
comparison
of
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
armies
considering
that
raw
troops
have
a
decided
advantage
on
the
defensive
detracts
to
a
certain
degree
from
the
credit
of
the
victory
and
it
will
hardly
be
questioned
that
had
the
tactics
of
the
federals
been
better
the
victory
would
have
been
theirs
the
turning
movement
by
sudley
springs
was
a
skilful
manoeuvre
and
completely
surprised
both
johnston
and
beauregard
it
was
undoubtedly
risky
but
it
was
far
less
dangerous
than
a
direct
attack
on
the
strong
position
along
bull
run
the
retention
of
the
fourth
division
between
washington
and
centreville
would
seem
to
have
been
a
blunder
another
men
on
the
field
of
battle
should
certainly
have
turned
the
scale
but
more
men
were
hardly
wanted
the
federals
during
the
first
period
of
the
fight
were
strong
enough
to
have
seized
the
henry
hill
bee
bartow
evans
and
hampton
had
been
driven
in
and
jackson
alone
stood
fast
a
strong
and
sustained
attack
supported
by
the
fire
of
the
regular
batteries
must
have
succeeded
had
an
attack
said
general
johnston
been
made
in
force
with
double
line
of
battle
such
as
any
in
the
united
states
service
would
now
make
we
could
not
have
held
the
position
for
half
an
hour
for
they
would
have
enveloped
us
on
both
flanks
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
swinton
page
the
federal
regiments
however
were
practically
incapable
of
movement
under
fire
the
least
change
of
position
broke
them
into
fragments
there
was
much
wild
firing
it
was
impossible
to
manoeuvre
and
the
courage
of
individuals
proved
a
sorry
substitute
for
order
and
cohesion
the
confederates
owed
their
victory
simply
and
solely
to
the
fact
that
their
enemies
had
not
yet
learned
to
use
their
strength
the
summer
months
went
by
without
further
fighting
on
the
potomac
but
the
camps
at
fairfax
and
at
centreville
saw
the
army
of
manassas
thinned
by
furloughs
and
by
sickness
the
southern
youth
had
come
out
for
battle
and
the
monotonous
routine
of
the
outpost
line
and
the
was
little
to
their
taste
the
government
dared
not
refuse
the
numberless
applications
for
leave
of
absence
the
more
so
that
in
the
crowded
camps
the
sultry
heat
of
the
virginia
woodlands
bred
disease
of
a
virulent
type
the
first
brigade
seems
to
have
escaped
from
all
these
evils
its
commander
found
his
health
improved
by
his
life
in
the
open
air
his
wound
had
been
painful
a
finger
was
broken
but
the
hand
was
saved
and
some
temporary
inconvenience
alone
resulted
as
he
claimed
no
furlough
for
himself
so
he
permitted
no
absence
from
duty
among
his
troops
i
ca
be
absent
he
wrote
to
his
wife
as
my
attention
is
necessary
in
preparing
my
troops
for
hard
fighting
should
it
be
required
and
as
my
officers
and
soldiers
are
not
permitted
to
visit
their
wives
and
families
i
ought
not
to
see
mine
it
might
make
the
troops
feel
that
they
are
badly
treated
and
that
i
consult
my
own
comfort
regardless
of
theirs
in
september
his
wife
joined
him
for
a
few
days
at
centreville
and
later
came
white
at
his
invitation
to
preach
to
his
command
beyond
a
few
fruitless
marches
to
support
the
cavalry
on
the
outposts
of
active
service
there
was
none
but
jackson
was
not
the
man
to
let
the
time
pass
uselessly
he
had
his
whole
brigade
under
his
hand
a
force
which
wanted
but
one
quality
to
make
it
an
instrument
worthy
of
the
hand
that
wielded
it
and
that
quality
was
discipline
courage
and
enthusiasm
it
possessed
in
abundance
and
when
both
were
untrained
the
confederate
was
a
more
useful
soldier
than
the
northerner
in
the
south
nearly
every
man
was
a
hunter
accustomed
from
boyhood
to
the
use
of
firearms
game
was
abundant
and
it
was
free
to
all
sport
in
one
form
or
another
was
the
chief
recreation
of
the
people
and
their
pastoral
pursuits
left
them
much
leisure
for
its
indulgence
every
great
plantation
had
its
pack
of
hounds
and
an
heirloom
from
the
english
colonists
still
flourished
his
stud
was
the
pride
of
every
southern
gentleman
and
the
love
of
was
inherent
in
the
whole
population
no
man
walked
when
he
could
ride
and
hundreds
of
fine
horsemen
mounted
on
steeds
of
famous
lineage
recruited
the
confederate
squadrons
but
despite
their
skill
with
the
rifle
their
hunter
craft
and
their
dashing
horsemanship
the
first
great
battle
had
been
hardly
won
the
northerners
unused
to
arms
and
uninured
to
hardship
had
fought
with
extraordinary
determination
and
the
same
want
of
discipline
that
had
driven
them
in
rout
to
washington
had
dissolved
the
victorious
confederates
into
a
tumultuous
mob
colonel
williams
of
the
virginia
writes
that
the
stonewall
brigade
was
a
notable
exception
to
the
general
disintegration
and
that
it
was
in
good
condition
for
immediate
service
on
the
morning
after
the
battle
if
jackson
knew
the
worth
of
his
volunteers
he
was
no
stranger
to
their
shortcomings
his
thoughts
might
be
crystallised
in
the
words
of
wellington
words
which
should
never
be
forgotten
by
those
nations
which
depend
for
their
defence
on
the
services
of
their
citizen
soldiery
they
want
said
the
great
duke
speaking
of
the
portuguese
in
the
habits
and
the
spirit
of
soldiers
the
habits
of
command
on
one
side
and
of
obedience
on
the
other
mutual
confidence
between
officers
and
men
in
order
that
during
the
respite
now
offered
he
might
instil
these
habits
into
his
brigade
jackson
neither
took
furlough
himself
nor
granted
it
to
others
his
regiments
were
constantly
exercised
on
the
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
advanced
and
retired
marched
and
countermarched
massed
in
column
formed
line
to
front
or
flank
until
they
learned
to
move
as
a
machine
until
the
limbs
obeyed
before
the
order
had
passed
from
ear
to
brain
until
obedience
became
an
instinct
and
cohesion
a
necessity
of
their
nature
they
learned
to
listen
for
the
word
of
the
officer
to
look
to
him
before
they
moved
hand
or
foot
and
in
that
subjection
of
their
own
individuality
to
the
will
of
their
superior
they
acquired
that
steadiness
in
battle
that
energy
on
the
march
that
discipline
in
quarters
which
made
the
first
brigade
worthy
of
the
name
it
had
already
won
every
officer
and
soldier
said
their
commander
who
is
able
to
do
duty
ought
to
be
busily
engaged
in
military
preparation
by
hard
drilling
in
order
that
through
the
blessing
of
god
we
may
be
victorious
in
the
battles
which
in
his
providence
may
await
us
jackson
tactical
ideas
as
regards
the
fire
of
infantry
expressed
at
this
time
are
worth
recording
i
rather
think
he
said
that
fire
by
file
independent
firing
is
best
on
the
whole
for
it
gives
the
enemy
an
idea
that
the
fire
is
heavier
than
if
it
was
by
company
or
battalion
volley
firing
sometimes
however
one
may
be
best
sometimes
the
other
according
to
circumstances
but
my
opinion
is
that
there
ought
not
to
be
much
firing
at
all
my
idea
is
that
the
best
mode
of
fighting
is
to
reserve
your
fire
till
the
enemy
get
or
you
get
them
to
close
quarters
then
deliver
one
deadly
deliberate
fire
and
charge
although
the
newspapers
did
scant
justice
to
the
part
played
by
the
brigade
in
the
battle
of
bull
run
lee
epithet

and
jackson
became
known
as
stonewall
throughout
the
army
to
one
of
his
acquaintances
the
general
revealed
the
source
of
his
composure
under
fire
three
days
after
the
battle
hearing
that
jackson
was
suffering
from
his
wound
i
rode
writes
imboden
to
his
quarters
near
centreville
of
course
the
battle
was
the
only
topic
discussed
during
breakfast
general
i
remarked
how
is
it
that
you
can
keep
so
cool
and
appear
so
utterly
insensible
to
danger
in
such
a
storm
of
shell
and
bullets
as
rained
about
you
when
your
hand
was
hit
he
instantly
became
grave
and
reverential
in
his
manner
and
answered
in
a
low
tone
of
great
earnestness
captain
my
religious
belief
teaches
me
to
feel
as
safe
in
battle
as
in
bed
god
has
fixed
the
time
for
my
death
i
do
not
concern
myself
about
that
but
to
be
always
ready
no
matter
when
it
may
overtake
me
he
added
after
a
pause
looking
me
full
in
the
face
that
is
the
way
all
men
should
live
and
then
all
would
be

and

pages
and
although
the
war
upon
the
borders
had
not
yet
touched
the
cities
of
the
south
the
patriotism
of
virginia
saw
with
uneasiness
the
inroads
of
the
enemy
in
that
portion
of
the
state
which
lies
beyond
the
alleghanies
especially
the
the
country
was
overrun
with
federal
soldiers
and
part
of
the
population
of
the
district
had
declared
openly
for
the
union
in
that
district
was
the
home
of
his
childhood
and
his
mother
grave
his
interest
and
his
affections
were
bound
by
many
ties
to
the
country
and
the
people
and
in
the
autumn
of
he
had
not
yet
come
to
believe
that
they
were
at
heart
disloyal
to
their
native
state
a
vigorous
effort
he
believed
might
still
restore
to
the
confederacy
a
splendid
and
he
made
no
secret
of
his
desire
for
employment
in
that
region
the
strategical
advantages
of
this
corner
of
virginia
were
clearly
apparent
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
to
his
perception
along
its
western
border
runs
the
ohio
a
river
navigable
to
its
junction
with
the
mississippi
and
giving
an
easy
line
of
communication
into
the
heart
of
kentucky
through
its
northern
counties
passed
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
the
main
line
of
communication
between
washington
and
the
west
and
alongside
the
railway
ran
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
canal
a
second
and
most
important
line
of
supply
above
all
projecting
as
it
did
towards
the
great
lakes
of
the
north
the

or
virginia
panhandle
narrowed
the
passage
between
east

not
more
than
a
hundred
miles
in
breadth
with
this
territory
in
the
possession
of
the
confederates
the
federal
dominions
would
be
practically
cut
in
two
and
in
virginia
traversed
by
many
ranges
of
pathless
mountains
with
few
towns
and
still
fewer
roads
a
small

might
defy
a
large

impunity
november

jackson
wish
was
partially
granted
he
was
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
shenandoah
valley
district
embracing
the
northern
part
of
the
area
between
the
alleghanies
and
the
blue
ridge
the
order
was
received
with
gratitude
but
dashed
by
the
fact
that
he
had
to
depart
alone
had
this
communication
he
said
to
white
not
come
as
an
order
i
should
instantly
have
declined
it
and
continued
in
command
of
my
brave
old
brigade
whether
he
or
his
soldiers
felt
the
parting
most
it
is
hard
to
say
certain
it
is
that
the
men
had
a
warm
regard
for
their
leader
there
was
no
more
about
him
at
centreville
to
attract
the
popular
fancy
than
there
had
been
at
harper
ferry
when
the
troops
passed
in
review
the
eye
of
the
spectator
turned
at
once
to
the
trim
carriage
of
johnston
and
of
beauregard
to
the
glittering
uniform
of
stuart
to
the
superb
chargers
and
the
martial
bearing
of
young
officers
fresh
from
the
indian
frontier
the
silent
professor
absent
and
unsmiling
who
dressed
as
plainly
as
he
lived
had
little
in
common
with
those
dashing
soldiers
the
tent
where
every
night
the
general
and
his
staff
gathered
together
for
their
evening
devotions
where
the
conversation
ran
not
on
the
merits
of
horse
and
hound
on
strategy
and
tactics
but
on
the
power
of
faith
and
the
mysteries
of
the
redemption
seemed
out
of
place
in
an
army
of
youths
but
while
they
smiled
at
his
peculiarities
the
confederate
soldiers
remembered
the
fierce
counterstroke
on
the
heights
above
bull
run
if
the
presbyterian
general
was
earnest
in
prayer
they
knew
that
he
was
prompt
in
battle
and
indefatigable
in
quarters
he
had
the
respect
of
all
men
and
from
his
own
brigade
he
had
something
more
very
early
in
their
service
away
by
the
rippling
shenandoah
they
had
heard
the
stories
of
his
daring
in
mexico
they
had
experienced
his
skill
and
coolness
at
falling
waters
they
had
seen
at
bull
run
while
the
shells
burst
in
succession
among
the
pines
the
quiet
figure
riding
slowly
to
and
fro
on
the
crest
above
them
they
had
heard
the
stern
command
wait
till
they
come
within
fifty
yards
and
then
give
them
the
bayonet
and
they
had
followed
him
far
in
that
victorious
rush
into
the
receding
ranks
of
their
astonished
foe
little
wonder
that
these
enthusiastic
youths
new
to
the
trade
should
have
been
captivated
by
a
nature
so
strong
and
fearless
the
stonewall
brigade
had
made
jackson
a
hero
and
he
had
won
more
from
them
than
their
admiration
his
incessant
watchfulness
for
their
comfort
and
the
patient
care
with
which
he
instructed
them
his
courtesy
to
the
youngest
private
the
tact
and
thoughtfulness
he
showed
in
all
his
relations
with
them
had
won
their
affection
his
very
peculiarities
endeared
him
to
them
old
jack
or
stonewall
were
his
nicknames
in
the
lines
of
his
own
command
and
stories
went
round
the
camp
fire
of
how
he
had
been
seen
walking
in
the
woods
round
centreville
absorbed
in
prayer
or
lifting
his
left
hand
with
that
peculiar
gesture
which
the
men
believed
was
an
appeal
to
heaven
but
which
in
reality
was
made
to
relieve
the
pain
of
his
wounded
finger
but
while
they
discussed
his
oddities
not
a
man
in
the
brigade
but
acknowledged
his
ability
and
when
the
time
came
not
a
man
but
regretted
his
departure
his
farewell
to
his
troops
was
a
striking
scene
the
forest
already
donning
its
gorgeous
autumnal
robes
shut
in
the
grassy
clearing
where
the
troops
were
drawn
up
there
stood
the
grey
columns
of
the
five
regiments
with
the
colours
already
tattered
waving
in
the
mild
november
air
the
general
rode
up
their
own
general
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
motionless
and
silent
they
stood
a
veritable
stone
wall
whilst
his
eye
ran
along
the
ranks
and
scanned
the
familiar
faces
i
am
not
here
to
make
a
speech
he
said
but
simply
to
say
farewell
i
first
met
you
at
harper
ferry
at
the
commencement
of
the
war
and
i
can
not
take
leave
of
you
without
giving
expression
to
my
admiration
of
your
conduct
from
that
day
to
this
whether
on
the
march
in
the
bivouac
or
on
the
bloody
plains
of
manassas
where
you
gained
the
reputation
of
having
decided
the
fate
of
battle
throughout
the
broad
extent
of
country
through
which
you
have
marched
by
your
respect
for
the
rights
and
property
of
citizens
you
have
shown
that
you
are
soldiers
not
only
to
defend
but
able
and
willing
both
to
defend
and
protect
you
have
already
won
a
brilliant
reputation
throughout
the
army
of
the
whole
confederacy
and
i
trust
in
the
future
by
your
deeds
in
the
field
and
by
the
assistance
of
the
same
kind
providence
who
has
hitherto
favoured
our
cause
you
will
win
more
victories
and
add
lustre
to
the
reputation
you
now
enjoy
you
have
already
gained
a
proud
position
in
the
future
history
of
this
our
second
war
of
independence
i
shall
look
with
great
anxiety
to
your
future
movements
and
i
trust
whenever
i
shall
hear
of
the
first
brigade
on
the
field
of
battle
it
will
be
of
still
nobler
deeds
achieved
and
higher
reputation
won
then
there
was
a
pause
general
and
soldiers
looked
upon
each
other
and
the
heart
of
the
leader
went
out
to
those
who
had
followed
him
with
such
devotion
he
had
spoken
his
words
of
formal
praise
but
both
he
and
they
knew
the
bonds
between
them
were
too
strong
to
be
thus
coldly
severed
for
once
he
gave
way
to
impulse
his
eye
kindled
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
throwing
the
reins
upon
his
horse
neck
he
spoke
in
tones
which
betrayed
the
proud
memories
that
thronged
upon
him
in
the
army
of
the
shenandoah
you
were
the
first
brigade
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
you
were
the
first
brigade
in
the
second
corps
of
the
army
you
are
the
first
brigade
you
are
the
first
brigade
in
the
affections
of
your
general
and
i
hope
by
your
future
deeds
and
bearing
you
will
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
the
first
brigade
in
this
our
second
war
of
independence
farewell
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
the
feeling
found
expression
and

lord

severely
criticised
for
asserting
that
in
the
civil
war
from
first
to

the
of
even
one
army
corps
men
of
regular
troops
would
have
given
complete
victory
to
whichever
side
it
fought
on
whatever
may
be
argued
as
to
the
latter
period
of
the
conflict
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
who
understands
the
power
of
organisation
of
discipline
of
training
and
of
a
proper
system
of
command
to
dispute
the
accuracy
of
this
statement
as
regards
the
year
that
is
for
the
first
eight
months
it
is
far
too
often
assumed
that
the
number
of
men
is
the
true
criterion
of
national
strength
in
the
confederate
states
for
instance
there
were
probably
citizens
who
were
liable
for
service
in
the
militia
and
yet
had
the
united
states
possessed
a
single
regular
army
corps
with
a
trained
staff
an
efficient
commissariat
and
a
system
of
transport
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
these
southerners
could
have
done
more
than
wage
a
guerilla
warfare
the
army
corps
would
have
absorbed
into
itself
the
best
of
the
northern
militia
and
volunteers
the
staff
and
commissariat
would
have
given
them
mobility
and
or
men
moving
on
richmond
directly
sumter
fell
with
the
speed
and
certainty
which
organisation
gives
would
have
marched
from
victory
to
victory
their
enemies
would
never
have
had
time
to
arm
to
assemble
to
organise
to
create
an
army
to
train
a
staff
or
to
arrange
for
their
supplies
each
gathering
of
volunteers
would
have
been
swept
away
before
it
had
attained
consistency
and
virginia
at
least
must
have
been
conquered
in
the
first
few
months
and
matters
would
have
been
no
different
if
the
army
corps
had
been
directed
against
the
union
in
the
northern
states
there
were
over
men
who
were
liable
for
service
and
yet
the
union
states
notwithstanding
their

numbers
even
if

than
useless
without
training
and

the

that
are

on

the

crushing
and
their
defeat
nor
can
the
theory
be
sustained
that
a
small

invading

country
would
be
stung
to
death
by
the
numbers
of
its
foes
even

they

of
what

the
stupendous
efforts
of
the
french
republic
in
and
enormous
armies
were
raised
and
equipped
the

were
filled
with
brave
men
the
generals
were
not
unskilful
and
yet
time
after

they
were
defeated
by
the
far
inferior
forces
of
their
seasoned
enemies
even
in
america
itself
on
two
occasions
at
sharpsburg
in
and
at

in
it
was
admitted
by
the

were
within

stone
throw
of
independence
and
yet
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
had
not
yet
joined

nor
can
spain
be
quoted
as
an
instance
of
an
unconquerable
nation
throughout
the

with

the
english
armies
not
only
that
under

but
those
at

for

the

even
patriots
must
be

they
must
be
able

against

against

earthworks
are
useless
as
the

to

must

it
is
when

that

begins
if

was
preparing
to
put
forth
her
stupendous
strength
scott
had
resigned
mcdowell
had
been
superseded
but
the
president
had
found
a
general
who
had
caught
the
confidence
of
the
nation
in
the
same
month
that
had
witnessed
mcdowell
defeat
a
young
officer
had
gained
a
cheap
victory
over
a
small
confederate
force
in
west
virginia
and
his
grandiloquent
dispatches
had
magnified
the
achievement
in
the
eyes
of
the
northern
people
he
was
at
once
nicknamed
the
young
napoleon
and
his
accession
to
the
chief
command
of
the
federal
armies
was
enthusiastically
approved
general
mcclellan
had
been
educated
at
west
point
and
had
graduated
first
of
the
class
in
which
jackson
was
seventeenth
he
had
been
appointed
to
the
engineers
had
served
on
the
staff
in
the
war
with
mexico
and
as
united
states
commissioner
with
the
allied
armies
in
the
crimea
in
he
resigned
to
become
president
of
a
railway
company
and
when
the
war
broke
out
he
was
commissioned
by
the
state
of
ohio
as
of
volunteers
his
reputation
at
the
military
academy
and
in
the
regular
army
had
been
high
his
ability
and
industry
were
unquestioned
his
physique
was
powerful
and
he
was
a
fine
horseman
his
influence
over
his
troops
was
remarkable
and
he
was
emphatically
a
gentleman
it
was
most
fortunate
for
the
union
at
this
juncture
that
caution
and
method
were
his
distinguishing
characteristics
the
states
had
placed
at
lincoln
disposal
sufficient
troops
to
form
an
army
seven
times
greater
than
that
which
had
been
defeated
at
bull
run
mcclellan
however
had
no
thought
of
committing
the
new
levies
to
an
enterprise
for
which
they
were
unfitted
he
had
determined
that
the
army
should
make
no
move
till
it
could
do
so
with
the
certainty
of
success
and
the
winter
months
were
to
be
devoted
to
training
and
organisation
nor
was
there
any
cry
for
immediate
action
the
experiment
of
a
civilian
army
had
proved
a
terrible
failure
the
nation
that
had
been
so
confident
of
capturing
richmond
was
now
anxious
for
the
security
of
washington
the
war
had
been
in
progress
for
nearly
six
months
and
yet
the
troops
were
manifestly
unfit
for
offensive
operations
even
the
crude
strategists
of
the
press
had
become
alive
to
the
importance
of
drill
and
discipline
october

reconnaissance
in

pushed
contrary
to
mcclellan
orders
across
the

was
repulsed
by
general
evans
at
ball
bluff
with
heavy
loss
and
mismanagement
and
misconduct
were
so
evident
that
the
defeat
did
much
towards
inculcating
patience
so
the
work
went
on
quietly
but
surely
the
general
supported
by
the
president
and
the
nation
giving
men
and
money
without
remonstrance
the
south
on
the
other
hand
was
still
apathetic
the
people
deluded
by
their
decisive
victory
underrated
the
latent
strength
of
their
mighty
adversary
they
appear
to
have
believed
that
the
earthworks
which
had
transformed
centreville
into
a
formidable
fortress
manned
by
the
army
of
northern
virginia
as
the
force
under
johnston
was
now
designated
were
sufficient
in
themselves
to
end
the
war
they
had
not
yet
learned
that
there
were
many
roads
to
richmond
and
that
a
passive
defence
is
no
safeguard
against
a
persevering
foe
the
government
expecting
much
from
the
intervention
of
the
european
powers
did
nothing
to
press
the
advantage
already
gained
in
vain
the
generals
urged
the
president
to
reinforce
the
army
at
centreville
to
men
and
to
give
it
transport
and
supplies
sufficient
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
potomac
above
washington
in
vain
they
pointed
out
in
answer
to
the
reply
that
the
government
could
furnish
neither
men
nor
arms
that
large
bodies
of
troops
were
retained
at
points
the
occupation
of
which
by
the
enemy
would
cause
only
a
local
inconvenience
was
it
not
possible
they
asked
the
president
by
stripping
other
points
to
the
last
they
would
bear
and
even
risking
defeat
at
all
other
places
to
put
the
virginian
army
in
condition
for
a
forward
movement
success
they
said
in
the
neighbourhood
of
washington
was
success
everywhere
and
it
was
upon
the
frontier
that
all
the
available
force
of
the
confederacy
should
be
concentrated
davis
was
immovable
although
lee
who
had
been
appointed
to
a
command
in
west
virginia
almost
immediately
after
bull
run
was
no
longer
at
hand
to
advise
him
he
probably
saw
the
strategical
requirements
of
the
situation
that
a
concentrated
attack
on
a
vital
point
is
a
better
measure
of
security
than
dissemination
along
a
frontier
that
the
is
the
soul
of
the
defence
and
that
the
true
policy
of
the
state
which
is
compelled
to
take
up
arms
against
a
superior
foe
is
to
allow
that
foe
no
are
truisms
which
it
would
be
an
insult
to
his
ability
to
say
that
he
did
not
realise
but
to
have
surrendered
territory
to
the
temporary
occupation
of
the
enemy
in
order
to
seek
a
problematical
victory
elsewhere
would
have
probably
provoked
a
storm
of
discontent
the
authority
of
the
new
government
was
not
yet
firmly
established
nor
was
the
patriotism
of
the
southern
people
so
entirely
unselfish
as
to
render
them
willing
to
endure
minor
evils
in
order
to
achieve
a
great
result
they
were
willing
to
fight
but
they
were
unwilling
that
their
own
states
should
be
left
unprotected
to
apply
frederick
the
great
requires
greater
strength
of
will
in
the
statesman
than
in
the
soldier
a
defensive
war
is
apt
to
betray
us
into
too
frequent
detachments
those
generals
who
have
had
but
little
experience
attempt
to
protect
every
point
while
those
who
are
better
acquainted
with
their
profession
having
only
the
capital
object
in
view
guard
against
a
decisive
blow
and
acquiesce
in
smaller
misfortunes
to
avoid
greater
frederick
the
great
instructions
to
his
generals
the
cries
and
complaints
of
those
who
find
themselves
abandoned
do
not
penetrate
to
the
camp
but
they
may
bring
down
an
administration
it
is
easy
to
contrive
excuses
for
the
inaction
of
the
president
and
it
is
no
new
thing
to
find
the
demands
of
strategy
sacrificed
to
political
expediency
nor
did
the
army
which
had
suffered
so
heavily
on
the
banks
of
bull
run
evince
any
marked
desire
to
be
led
across
the
potomac
furloughs
were
liberally
granted
officers
and
privates
dispersed
to
look
after
their
farms
and
their
plantations
the
harvests
had
to
be
gathered
the
negroes
required
the
master
eye
and
even
the
counties
of
virginia
asked
that
part
of
the
contingents
they
had
furnished
might
be
permitted
to
return
to
agricultural
pursuits
the
senior
generals
of
the
virginia
army
were
not
alone
in
believing
that
the
victory
they
had
won
would
be
barren
of
result
unless
it
were
at
once
utilised
as
a
basis
for
further
action
jackson
engrossed
as
he
was
with
the
training
of
his
command
found
time
to
reflect
on
the
broader
aspects
of
the
war
before
he
left
for
the
shenandoah
valley
he
sought
an
interview
with
general
smith
recently
appointed
to
the
command
of
his
division
finding
me
lying
down
in
my
tent
writes
this
officer
he
expressed
regret
that
i
was
sick
and
said
he
had
come
to
confer
with
me
on
a
subject
of
great
importance
but
would
not
then
trouble
me
with
it
i
told
him
that
i
wished
to
hear
whatever
he
desired
to
say
and
could
rest
whilst
he
was
talking
he
immediately
sat
down
on
the
ground
near
the
head
of
the
cot
on
which
i
was
lying
and
entered
on
the
subject
of
his
visit
he
said
his
army
of
recruits
will
not
attempt
to
come
out
against
us
this
autumn
if
we
remain
inactive
they
will
have
greatly
the
advantage
over
us
next
spring
their
raw
recruits
will
have
then
become
an
organised
army
vastly
superior
in
numbers
to
our
own
we
are
ready
at
the
present
moment
for
active
operations
in
the
field
while
they
are
not
we
ought
to
invade
their
country
now
and
not
wait
for
them
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
to
invade
ours
if
the
president
would
reinforce
this
army
by
taking
troops
from
other
points
not
threatened
and
let
us
make
an
active
campaign
of
invasion
before

he
then
requested
me
to
use
my
influence
with
generals
johnston
and
beauregard
in
favour
of
immediate
aggressive
operations
i
told
him
that
i
was
sure
that
an
attempt
on
my
part
to
exert
any
influence
in
favour
of
his
proposition
would
do
no
good
not
content
with
my
answer
he
repeated
his
arguments
dwelling
more
at
length
on
the
advantages
of
such
strategy
to
ourselves
and
its
disadvantages
to
the
enemy
and
again
urged
me
to
use
my
influence
to
secure
its
adoption
i
gave
him
the
same
reply
i
had
already
made
after
a
few
minutes
thought
he
abruptly
said
you
have
not
expressed
any
opinion
in
regard
to
the
views
i
have
laid
before
you
but
i
feel
assured
that
you
favour
them
and
i
think
you
ought
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
have
them
carried
into
effect
i
then
said
will
tell
you
a
secret
he
replied
do
not
tell
me
any
secret
i
would
prefer
not
to
hear
it
i
answered
must
tell
it
to
you
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
doing
so
because
i
am
certain
that
it
will
not
be
divulged
i
then
explained
to
him
that
these
views
had
already
been
laid
before
the
government
in
a
conference
which
had
taken
place
at
fairfax
court
house
in
the
first
days
of
october
between
president
davis
generals
johnston
beauregard
and
myself
and
told
him
the
result
when
i
had
finished
he
rose
from
the
ground
on
which
he
had
been
seated
shook
my
hand
warmly
and
said
am
sorry
very
sorry
without
another
word
he
went
slowly
out
to
his
horse
a
few
feet
in
front
of
my
tent
mounted
very
deliberately
and
rode
sadly
away
a
few
days
afterwards
he
was
ordered
to
the
valley
letter

it
was
under
such
depressing
circumstances
that
jackson
quitted
the
army
which
boldly
used
might
have
ensured
the
existence
of

his
headquarters
were
established
at
winchester
and
in

with

was
the
extreme
outpost
on

left
and
was
connected
with
the
main
body
by
a
detachment
at
leesburg
on
the
other
side
of
the
blue
ridge
under
his
general
hill
at
winchester
his
wife
joined
him
and
of
their
first
meeting
she
tells
a
pretty
story
it
can
readily
be
imagined
with
what
delight
general
domestic
plans
for
the
winter
were
hailed
by
me
and
without
waiting
for
the
promised
to
be
sent
on
escort
i
joined
some
friends
who
were
going
to
richmond
where
i
spent
a
few
days
to
shop
to
secure
a
passport
and
to
await
an
escort
to
winchester
the
latter
was
soon
found
in
a
old
clergyman
we
travelled
by
stage
coach
from
strasburg
and
were
told
before
reaching
winchester
that
general
jackson
was
not
there
having
gone
with
his
command
on
an
expedition
it
was
therefore
with
a
feeling
of
sad
disappointment
and
loneliness
that
i
alighted
in
front
of
taylor
hotel
at
midnight
in
the
early
part
of
dreary
cold
december
and
no
husband
to
meet
me
with
a
glad
welcome
by
the
dim
lamplight
i
noticed
a
small
group
of
soldiers
standing
in
the
wide
hall
but
they
remained
silent
spectators
and
my
escort
led
me
up
the
big
stairway
doubtless
feeling
disappointed
that
he
still
had
me
on
his
hands
just
before
reaching
the
landing
i
turned
to
look
back
for
one
figure
among
the
group
looked
startlingly
familiar
but
as
he
had
not
come
forward
i
felt
that
i
must
be
mistaken
however
my
backward
glance
revealed
an
officer
muffled
up
in
a
military
greatcoat
cap
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
following
us
in
rapid
pursuit
and
by
the
time
we
were
upon
the
top
step
a
pair
of
strong
arms
caught
me
the
captive
head
was
thrown
back
and
she
was
kissed
again
and
again
by
her
husband
before
she
could
recover
from
the
delightful
surprise
he
had
given
her
the
good
old
minister
chuckled
gleefully
and
was
no
doubt
a
sincere
sharer
in
the
joy
and
relief
experienced
by
his
charge
when
i
asked
my
husband
why
he
did
not
come
forward
when
i
got
out
of
the
coach
he
said
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
his
own
wife
as
he
did

blunder
of
kissing
anybody

esposa
the
people
amongst
whom
they
found
themselves
were
virginian
to
the
core
in
winchester
itself
the
feeling
against
the
north
was
exceptionally
bitter
the
town
was
no
mushroom
settlement
its
history
stretched
back
to
the
old
colonial
days
the
intrenchments
on
the
surrounding
hills
had
been
raised
by
washington
during
the
indian
wars
and
the
traditions
of
the
first
struggle
for
independence
were
not
yet
forgotten
no
single
section
of
the
south
was
more
conservative
although
the
citizens
had
been
strong
unionists
nowhere
were
the
principles
which
their
fathers
had
respected
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
state
and
the
right
of
secession
more
strongly
held
and
nowhere
had
the
hereditary
spirit
of
resistance
to
coercive
legislation
blazed
up
more
fiercely
the
soldiers
of
bull
run
who
had
driven
the
invader
from
the
soil
of
virginia
were
the
heroes
of
the
hour
and
the
leader
of
the
stonewall
brigade
had
peculiar
claims
on
the
hospitality
of
the
town
it
was
to
the
people
of
the
valley
that
he
owed
his
command
with
one
voice
wrote
the
secretary
of
war
have
they
made
constant
and
urgent
appeals
that
to
you
in
whom
they
have
confidence
their
defence
should
be
assigned
the
winchester
ladies
says
jackson
were
amongst
the
most
famous
of
virginia
housekeepers
and
lived
in
a
good
deal
of
elegance
and
profusion
the
old
border
town
had
not
then
changed
hands
with
the
conflicting
armies
as
it
was
destined
to
do
so
many
times
during
the
war
under
the
light
in
which
i
viewed
everything
that
winter
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
people
could
have
been
more
cultivated
attractive
and
winchester
was
rich
in
happy
homes
and
pleasant
people
and
the
extreme
kindness
and
appreciation
shown
to
general
jackson
by
all
bound
us
to
them
so
closely
and
warmly
that
ever
after
that
winter
he
called
the
place
our
home
but
amid
congenial
acquaintances
and
lovely
surroundings
with
the
tumult
of
war
quiescent
and
the
domestic
happiness
so
dear
to
him
restored
jackson
allowed
no
relaxation
either
to
himself
or
to
his
men
his
first
care
was
to
train
and
organise
his
new
regiments
the
ranks
were
filled
with
recruits
and
to
their
instruction
he
devoted
himself
with
unwearied
energy
his
small
force
of
cavalry
commanded
by
colonel
turner
ashby
a
gentleman
of
virginia
whose
name
was
to
become
famous
in
the
annals
of
the
confederacy
he
at
once
despatched
to
patrol
the
frontier
prompt
measures
were
taken
to
discipline
the
troops
and
that
this
last
was
a
task
of
no
little
difficulty
the
following
incident
suggests
in
the
middle
of
november
to
jackson
great
delight
the
stonewall
brigade
had
been
sent
to
him
from
manassas
and
after
its
arrival
an
order
was
issued
which
forbade
all
officers
leaving
the
camp
except
upon
passes
from
headquarters
a
protest
was
immediately
drawn
up
by
the
regimental
commanders
and
laid
before
the
general
they
complained
that
the
obnoxious
order
was
an
unwarranted
assumption
of
authority
disparaged
their
dignity
and
detracted
from
that
respect
of
the
force
under
their
command
which
was
necessary
to
maintain
their
authority
and
enforce
obedience
jackson
reply
well
illustrates
his
own
idea
of
discipline
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
should
be
upheld
his
wrote
as
follows
to
the
discontented
officers
the
commanding
desires
me
to
say
that
the
within
combined
protest
is
in
violation
of
army
regulations
and
subversive
of
military
discipline
he
claims
the
right
to
give
his
pickets
such
instructions
as
in
his
opinion
the
interests
of
the
service
require
colonels
and
on
the
day
that
their
regiments
arrived
at
their
present
encampment
either
from
incompetency
to
control
their
commands
or
from
neglect
of
duty
so
permitted
their
commands
to
become
disorganised
and
their
officers
and
men
to
enter
winchester
without
permission
as
to
render
several
arrests
of
officers
necessary
if
officers
desire
to
have
control
over
their
commands
they
must
remain
habitually
with
them
industriously
attend
to
their
instruction
and
comfort
and
in
battle
lead
them
well
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
command
their
admiration
such
officers
need
not
apprehend
loss
of
respect
resulting
from
inserting
in
a
written
pass
the
words
duty
or
private
business
should
they
have
occasion
to
pass
the
pickets
even
the
stonewall
brigade
had
yet
much
to
learn
at
this
time
jackson
was
besieged
with
numerous
applications
for
service
on
his
staff
the
majority
of
these
were
from
persons
without
experience
and
they
were
made
to
the
wrong
man
my
desire
he
wrote
is
to
get
a
staff
specially
qualified
for
their
specific
duties
i
know
personally
and
was
favourably
impressed
by
him
but
if
a
person
desires
office
in
these
times
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
is
to
pitch
into
service
somewhere
and
work
with
such
energy
skill
and
success
as
to
impress
those
round
him
with
the
conviction
that
such
are
his
merits
that
he
must
be
advanced
or
the
interests
of
the
service
must
suffer
my
desire
is
to
make
merit
the
basis
of
my
recommendations
social
claims
had
no
weight
with
him
whatever
he
felt
that
the
interests
at
stake
were
too
great
to
be
sacrificed
to
favouritism
or
friendship
and
he
had
seen
enough
of
war
to
know
the
importance
of
staff
work
nor
was
he
in
the
unfortunate
position
of
being
compelled
to
accept
the
nominees
of
his
superiors
the
confederate
authorities
were
wise
enough
to
permit
their
generals
to
choose
for
themselves
the
instruments
on
which
they
would
have
to
rely
for
the
execution
of
their
designs
wellington
in
had
forced
on
him
by
the
horse
guards
in
the
teeth
of
his
indignant
remonstrances
incompetent
officers
whom
he
did
not
know
and
whom
he
could
not
trust
jackson
in
a
country
which
knew
little
of
war
was
allowed
to
please
himself
he
need
appoint
no
one
without
learning
all
about
him
and
his
inquiries
were
searching
was
he
intelligent
was
he
trustworthy
was
he
industrious
did
he
get
up
early
if
a
man
was
wanting
in
any
one
of
these
qualifications
he
would
reject
him
however
highly
recommended
that
his
strict
investigations
and
his
insistence
on
the
possession
of
certain
essential
characteristics
bore
good
fruit
it
is
impossible
to
gainsay
the
absence
of
mishaps
and
errors
in
his
often
complicated
manoeuvres
is
sufficient
proof
that
he
was
exceedingly
well
served
by
his
subordinates
the
influence
of
a
good
staff
is
seldom
apparent
except
to
the
initiated
if
a
combination
succeeds
the
general
gets
all
the
credit
if
it
fails
he
gets
all
the
blame
and
while
no
agents
however
efficient
can
compensate
by
their
own
efforts
for
the
weakness
of
a
conception
that
is
radically
unsound
many
a
brilliant
plan
has
failed
in
execution
through
the
inefficiency
of
the
staff
in
his
selection
of
such
capable
men
as
his
assistants
must
needs
have
been
jackson
gave
proof
that
he
possessed
one
at
least
of
the
attributes
of
a
great
leader
he
was
not
only
a
judge
of
character
but
he
could
place
men
in
the
positions
to
which
they
were
best
suited
his
personal
predilections
were
never
allowed
to
interfere
for
some
months
his
chief
of
the
staff
was
a
presbyterian
clergyman
while
his
chief
quartermaster
was
one
of
the
hardest
swearers
in
virginia
the
fact
that
the
former
could
combine
the
duties
of
spiritual
adviser
with
those
of
his
official
position
made
him
a
congenial
comrade
but
it
was
his
energy
and
ability
rather
than
this
unusual
qualification
which
attracted
jackson
and
although
the
profanity
of
the
quartermaster
offended
his
susceptibilities
their
relations
were
always
cordial
it
was
to
the
intelligence
of
his
staff
officers
their
energy
and
their
loyalty
that
he
looked
for
the
business
in
hand
these
qualities
were
more
important
than
their
morals
that
a
civilian
should
be
found
serving
as
chief
of
the
staff
to
a
general
of
division
one
of
the
most
important
posts
in
the
military
hierarchy
is
a
curious
comment
on
the
organisation
of
the
confederate
army
the
regular
officers
who
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
the
south
had
as
a
rule
been
appointed
to
commands
and
the
generals
of
lower
rank
had
to
seek
their
staff
officers
amongst
the
volunteers
it
may
be
noticed
however
that
jackson
was
by
no
means
bigoted
in
favour
of
his
own
cloth
he
showed
no
anxiety
to
secure
their
services
on
his
staff
he
thought
many
of
them
unfitted
for
duties
which
brought
them
in
immediate
contact
with
the
volunteers
in
dealing
with
such
troops
tact
and
temper
are
of
more
importance
than
where
obedience
has
become
mechanical
and
the
claims
of
rank
are
instinctively
reflected
in
all
his
campaigns
too
jackson
was
practically
his
own
chief
of
the
staff
he
consulted
no
one
he
never
divulged
his
plans
he
gave
his
orders
and
his
staff
had
only
to
see
that
these
orders
were
obeyed
his
topographical
engineer
his
medical
director
his
commissary
and
his
quartermaster
were
selected
it
is
true
by
reason
of
their
special
qualifications
captain
hotchkiss
who
filled
the
first
position
was
a
young
man
of
whose
abilities
as
a
surveyor
were
well
known
in
the
valley
major
harman
his
chief
quartermaster
was
one
of
the
proprietors
of
a
line
of
stage
coaches
and
a
large
farmer
and
major
hawks
his
commissary
was
the
owner
of
a
carriage
manufactory
but
the
remainder
of
his
assistants
with
the
exception
of
the
chief
of
artillery
owed
their
appointments
rather
to
their
character
than
to
their
professional
abilities
it
is
not
to
be
understood
at
the
same
time
that
jackson
underrated
soldierly
acquirements
he
left
no
complaints
on
record
like
so
many
of
his
west
point
comrades
of
the
ignorance
of
the
volunteer
officers
and
of
the
consequent
difficulties
which
attended
every
combination
but
he
was
none
the
less
alive
to
their
deficiencies
early
in
when
the
military
system
of
the
confederacy
was
about
to
be
reorganised
he
urged
upon
the
government
through
the
member
of
congress
for
the
district
where
he
commanded
that
regimental
promotion
should
not
be
obtained
by
seniority
unless
the
applicant
were
approved
by
a
board
of
examination
and
it
was
due
to
his
representations
that
this
regulation
to
the
great
benefit
of
the
army
was
shortly
afterwards
adopted
with
all
his
appreciation
of
natural
aptitude
for
the
soldier
trade
so
close
a
student
of
napoleon
could
scarcely
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
most
heroic
character
unsustained
by
knowledge
is
practically
useless
if
napoleon
himself
more
highly
endowed
by
nature
with
every
military
attribute
than
any
other
general
of
the
christian
era
thought
it
essential
to
teach
himself
his
business
by
incessant
study
how
much
more
is
such
study
necessary
for
ordinary
men
but
no
man
was
less
likely
than
jackson
to
place
an
exaggerated
value
on
theoretical
acquirements
no
one
realised
more
fully
that
napoleon
character
won
more
victories
than
napoleon
knowledge
the
qualities
he
demanded
in
his
subordinates
were
those
which
were
conspicuous
in
napoleon
who
was
more
industrious
than
the
great
corsican
who
displayed
an
intenser
energy
whose
intelligence
was
brighter
who
understood
human
nature
better
or
handled
men
with
more
consummate
tact
these
were
the
very
attributes
which
distinguished
jackson
himself
they
are
the
to
his
success
more
so
than
his
knowledge
of
strategy
and
tactics
of
the
mechanism
of
march
and
battle
and
of
the
principles
of
the
military
art
in
selecting
his
staff
officers
therefore
he
deemed
character
of
more
importance
than
erudition
the
men
of
the
stonewall
brigade
had
a
saying
that
jackson
always
marched
at
dawn
except
when
he
started
the
night
before
and
it
was
perhaps
this
habit
which
his
enemies
found
so
unreasonable
that
led
him
to
lay
so
much
stress
on
early
rising
it
is
certain
that
like
wellington
he
preferred
three
in
the
morning
men
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
he
says
if
you
will
vouch
for
your
brother
being
an
early
riser
during
the
remainder
of
the
war
i
will
give
him
an
i
do
not
want
to
make
an
appointment
on
my
staff
except
of
such
as
are
early
risers
but
if
you
will
vouch
for
him
to
rise
regularly
at
dawn
i
will
offer
him
the
position
another
characteristic
he
looked
for
was
reticence
and
it
was
undeniably
of
the
utmost
importance
especially
in
an
army
which
spoke
the
same
language
as
the
enemy
where
desertion
was
not
uncommon
and
spies
could
easily
escape
detection
that
the
men
who
might
become
cognisant
of
the
plans
of
the
commander
should
be
gifted
with
discretion
absolute
concealment
is
generally
impracticable
in
a
camp
maps
must
be
drawn
and
reports
furnished
reconnoitring
parties
must
be
sent
out
roads
examined
positions
surveyed
and
shelter
and
supplies
requisitioned
in
advance
thus
the
movements
of
staff
officers
are
a
clue
to
the
projected
movements
of
the
army
and
the
smallest
hint
may
set
a
hundred
brains
to
the
work
of
surmise
there
will
always
be
many
who
are
just
as
anxious
to
discover
the
general
intentions
as
he
is
to
conceal
them
and
if
by
any
possibility
whatever
the
gossip
and
guesses
of
the
camp
may
come
to
the
enemy
ears
it
is
well
that
curiosity
should
be
baulked
nor
is
it
undesirable
that
the
privacy
of
headquarters
should
be
respected
the
vanity
of
a
little
brief
authority
has
before
now
tempted
subordinate
officers
to
hint
at
weaknesses
on
the
part
of
their
superiors
ignorance
of
war
and
of
the
situation
has
induced
them
to
criticise
and
to
condemn
and
idle
words
greedily
listened
to
and
quickly
exaggerated
may
easily
destroy
the
confidence
of
the
soldiery
in
the
abilities
of
their
leader

still
the

which
confronted
jackson
was
far
superior
to
his
own
the
potomac
was
broad
and
bridgeless
and
his
orders
appeared
to
impose
a
defensive
attitude
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
rest
inactive
no
matter
what
the
odds
against
him
or
to
watch
the
enemy
growing
strength
without
an
endeavour
to
interfere
within
the
limits
of
his
own
command
he
was
permitted
every
latitude
and
he
was
determined
to
apply
the
aggressive
strategy
which
he
was
so
firmly
convinced
should
be
adopted
by
the
whole
army
the
secretary
of
war
benjamin
in
detaching
him
to
the
valley
had
asked
him
to
forward
suggestions
as
to
the
means
of
rendering
his
measures
of
defence
effectual
volume
page
the
earliest
information
he
had
received
on
his
arrival
at
winchester
pointed
to
the
conclusion
that
the
enemy
was
meditating
an
advance
by
way
of
harper
ferry
his
first
suggestion
thereupon
was
that
he
should
be
reinforced
by
a
division
under
general
loring
and
a
brigade
under
colonel
edward
johnson
which
were
stationed
within

his
next
was
to
the
effect
that

should
be
permitted
to
organise
an
expedition
for
the
recapture
and

of
romney
if
he
could
seize
this
village
the
junction
of
several
roads
more
decisive
operations
would
at
once
become
feasible
it
has
been
said
that
the
force
of
old
associations
urged
jackson
to
drive
the
invader
from
the
soil
which
held
his
mother
grave
but
even
if
we
had
not
the
evidence
of
his
interview
with
general
smith
ante
page
a
glance
at
the
map
would
in
itself
be
sufficient
to
assure
us
that
strategy
prevailed
with
him
rather
than
sentiment
the
plan
of
campaign
which
first
suggested
itself
to
him
was
sufficiently
comprehensive
while
the
northern
people
and
the
federal
authorities
were
still
a
prey
to
the
demoralisation
which
had
followed
bull
run
he
proposed
to
advance
with
troops
into
virginia
where
he
would
reclaim
the
whole
country
and
summon
the
inhabitants
of
southern
sentiment
to
join
his
army
his
information
was
extensive
and
reliable
and
he
did
not
doubt
his
ability
to
recruit
between
and
men
enough
for
his
designs
these
were
bold
and
simple
while
the
enemy
was
under
the
impression
that
his
only
object
was
to
reclaim
and
occupy
virginia
he
would
move
his
whole
force
rapidly
across
to
the
monongahela
march
down
upon
pittsburg
destroy
the
united
states
arsenal
and
then
in
conjunction
with
johnston
army
which
was
to
cross
the
potomac
at
leesburg
advance
upon
harrisburg
the
capital
of
pennsylvania
from
harrisburg
he
proposed
that
the
army
should
advance
upon
philadelphia
cooke

these
suggestions
however
went
no
further
than
his
friends
in
the
legislative
assembly
although
for
his
conduct
at
bull
run
he
had
now
been
promoted
to
the
lexington
professor
had
as
yet
no
voice
in
the
councils
of
the

republic

the

approved
the
less
ambitious

an

the

the

jackson
letter
to
the
secretary
of
war
was
as
follows
november
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
absolute
secrecy
respecting
military
operations
i
have
made
it
a
point
to
say
but
little
respecting
my
proposed
movements
in
the
event
of
sufficient
reinforcements
arriving
but
since
conversing
with
preston
his
upon
his
return
from
general
loring
and
ascertaining
the
disposition
of
the
general
forces
i
venture
to
respectfully
urge
that
after
concentrating
all
his
troops
here
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
capture
the
federal
forces
at
romney
the
attack
on
romney
would
probably
induce
mcclellan
to
believe
that
general
johnston
army
had
been
so
weakened
as
to
justify
him
in
making
an
advance
on
centreville
but
should
this
not
induce
him
to
advance
i
do
not
believe
anything
will
during
this
winter
should
general
johnston
be
attacked
i
would
be
at
once
prepared
to
reinforce
him
with
my
present
force
increased
by
general
loring
after
repulsing
the
enemy
at
manassas
let
the
troops
that
marched
on
romney
return
to
the
valley
and
move
rapidly
westward
to
the
waters
of
the
monongahela
and
little
kanawha
i
deem
it
of
very
great
importance
that
virginia
be
occupied
by
confederate
troops
this
winter
at
present
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
enemy
are
not
expecting
an
attack
there
and
the
resources
of
that
region
necessary
for
the
subsistence
of
our
troops
are
in
greater
abundance
than
in
almost
any
other
season
of
the
year
postpone
the
occupation
of
that
section
until
spring
and
we
may
expect
to
find
the
enemy
prepared
for
us
and
the
resources
to
which
i
have
referred
greatly
exhausted
i
know
that
what
i
have
proposed
will
be
an
arduous
undertaking
and
can
not
be
accomplished
without
the
sacrifice
of
much
personal
comfort
but
i
feel
that
the
troops
will
be
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifice
when
animated
by
the
prospects
of
important
results
to
our
cause
and
distinction
to
themselves
it
may
be
urged
against
this
plan
that
the
enemy
will
advance
from
beverley
and
the
great
kanawha
on
staunton
or
huntersville
i
am
well
satisfied
that
such
a
step
would
but
make
their
destruction
sure
when
virginia
is
occupied
in
force
the
kanawha
valley
unless
it
be
the
lower
part
of
it
must
be
evacuated
by
the
federal
forces
or
otherwise
their
safety
will
be
endangered
by
forcing
a
column
across
from
the
little
kanawha
between
them
and
the
ohio
river
admitting
that
the
season
is
too
far
advanced
or
that
from
other
causes
all
can
not
be
accomplished
that
has
been
named
yet
through
the
blessing
of
god
who
has
thus
far
wonderfully
prospered
our
cause
much
more
may
be
expected
from
general
loring
troops
according
to
this
programme
than
can
be
expected
from
them
where
they
are
volume

this
scheme
was
endorsed
by
johnston

submit
he
wrote
that
the
troops
under
general
loring
might
render
valuable
services
by
taking
the
field
with
general
jackson
instead
of
going
into
winter
quarters
as
now
proposed
in
accordance
with
jackson
suggestion
loring
was
ordered
to
join
him
edward

however
was
withheld
the
confederate

seem
to
have
considered
it
injudicious
to
leave
unguarded
the
mountain
roads
which
lead
into
the
valley
from
the
west
jackson
with
a
wider
grasp
of
war
held
that
concentration
at
winchester
was
a
sounder
measure
of
security
should
the
federals
at
beverley
he
said
take
advantage
of
the
withdrawal
of
johnson
troops
and
cross
the
mountains
so
much
the
worse
for
them
while
they
were
marching
eastwards
involving
themselves
amongst
interminable
obstacles
he
jackson
would
place
himself
on
their
communications

close
in
behind

their
destruction

more
certain

they
advanced

resolved
to
complete
the
education
of
his
new
battalions
in
the
field
the
raw
troops
who
garrisoned
the
northern
border
were
not
formidable
enemies
and
a
sudden
rush
upon
some
post
would
give
to
the
staff

soldiery
that
first
taste
of
success

gives

go

cut

strengthened
jackson
was
of
opinion
that
the
true
policy
of
the
federals
would
be
to
concentrate
at
martinsburg
midway
between
romney
and
frederick
and
to
march
on
winchester
over
a
road
that
presented
no
very
strong
positions
to
counteract
such
a
combination
he
determined
to
anticipate
their
movements
and
to
attack
them
before
they
received
additional
reinforcements

by
dispersing
these
detachments
he
would
prevent
support
being
sent
to
romney
by
cutting
the
telegraph
along
the
railroad
he
would
sever
the
communication
between
banks
at
frederick

in
west

and
compel
kelly
either
to
evacuate
romney
or
fight
him
to
deal
with
his
enemy
in
detail
to
crush
his
detachments
in
succession
and
with
superior
force
such
was
the
essence
of
his
plan
the
weather
when
the
expedition
started
was
bright
and
pleasant
so
much
so
that
the
troops
with
the
improvidence
of
young
soldiers
left
their
coats
and
blankets
in
the
waggons
that
very
afternoon
however
the
temperature
underwent
a
sudden
change
under
cold
grey
skies
the
column
scaled
the
mountain
ridges
and
on
the
winter
wind
came
a
fierce
storm
of
snow
and
hail
in
order
to
conceal
the
march
as
far
as
possible
from
the
enemy
observations
the
brigades
had
marched
by
country
roads
and
delayed
by
steep
gradients
and
slippery
tracks
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
the
supply
waggons
came
up
the
troops
hurried
suddenly
from
comfortable
winter
quarters
suffered
much
the
bivouac
was
as
cheerless
as
the
march
without
rations
and
without
covering
the
men
lay
shivering
round
the
camp
fires
the
third
day
out
even
the
commander
of
the
stonewall
brigade
took
it
upon
himself
to
halt
his
wearied
men
jackson
became
restive
riding
along
the
column
he
found
his
old
regiments
halted
by
the
roadside
and
asked
the
reason
for
the
delay
i
have
halted
to
let
the
men
cook
their
rations
was
general
garnett
reply
there
is
no
time
for
that
but
it
is
impossible
for
the
men
to
march
further
without
them
never
found
anything
impossible
with
this
brigade
and
jackson
rode
on
his
plans
admitted
of
no
delay
he
intended
to
surprise
the
enemy
in
this
expectation
however
he
was
disappointed
january
a
few
miles
distant
from
bath
his
advanced
guard
fell
in
with
a
federal
reconnaissance
and
at
nightfall
the
confederates
had
not
yet
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
once
more
they
had
to
bivouac
in
the
open
and
rations
tents
and
blankets
were
still
behind
when
the
day
broke
over
the
shenandoah
mountains
the
country
was
white
with
snow
and
the
sleeping
soldiers
were
covered
as
with
a
after
a
hasty
meal
an
attempt
was
made
to
surround
the
village
and
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
garrison
the
outflanking
movements
made
in
a
blinding
storm
failed
in
combination
the
roads
were
too
bad
the
subordinate
commanders
too
inexperienced
the
three
hostile
regiments
escaped
across
the
river
in
their
boats
and
only
prisoners
were
captured
still
the
advantages
of
their
unexpected
movement
were
not
altogether
lost
to
the
confederates
the
federals
ignorant
as
yet
of
the
restless
energy
of
the
foe
who
held
command
at
winchester
had
settled
themselves
cosily
in
winter
quarters
the
intelligence
of
jackson
march
had
come
too
late
to
enable
them
to
remove
the
stores
which
had
been
collected
at
bath
and
on
the
night
of
january
the
virginians
revelled
in
warmth
and
luxury
the
next
morning
they
moved
forward
to
the
river
january
on
the
opposite
bank
stood
the
village
of
hancock
and
after
a
demand
to
surrender
had
been
refused
jackson
ordered
his
batteries
to
open
fire
the
federal
commander
was
granted
two
hours
in
which
to
remove
the
women
and
children
shepherdstown
a
little
virginia
town
south
of
the
potomac
had
been
repeatedly
shelled
even
when
unoccupied
by
confederate
troops
in
order
to
intimate
that
such
outrages
must
cease
a
few
shells
were
thrown
into
hancock
the
next
day
the
bombardment
was
resumed
but
with
little
apparent
effect
and
strong
reinforcements
having
joined
the
enemy
jackson
ceased
fire
and
withdrew
a
bridge
was
already
in
process
of
construction
two
miles
above
the
town
but
to
have
crossed
the
river
a
wide
though
shallow
stream
in
face
of
a
considerable
force
would
have
been
a
useless
and
a
costly
operation
the
annihilation
of
the
federal
garrison
would
have
scarcely
repaid
the
southerners
for
the
loss
of
life
that
must
have
been
incurred
at
the
same
time
while
batteries
had
been
at
work
his
infantry
had
done
a
good
deal
of
mischief
two
regiments
had
burned
the
bridge
by
which
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
crosses
the
great
cacapon
river
the
canal
dam
was
breached
and
many
miles
of
track
and
telegraph
were
destroyed
the
enemy
communications
between
frederick
and
romney
were
thus
effectually
severed
and
a
large
amount
of
captured
stores
were
sent
to
winchester
it
was
with
the
design
of
covering
these
operations
that
the
bombardment
had
been
continued
and
the
summons
to
surrender
was
probably
no
more
than
a
ruse
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
federal
commander
from
the
attack
on
the
cacapon
bridge
on
the
morning
of
the
jackson
moved
southward
to
unger
store
here
however
the
expedition
came
to
a
standstill
the
precaution
of
the
horses
before
leaving
winchester
had
been
neglected
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
refit
the
teams
and
rest
the
men
january
after
halting
for
four
days
the
confederates
on
january
renewed
their
march
the
outlook
was
unpromising
although
cavalry
patrols
had
been
despatched
in
every
direction
a
detachment
of
militia
which
had
acted
as
in
the
direction
of
romney
while
jackson
was
moving
to
unger
store
had
been
surprised
and
defeated
with
the
loss
of
two
guns
at
hanging
rock
the
weather
too
grew
colder
and
colder
and
the
mountain
roads
were
little
more
than
sheets
of
ice
the
sleet
beat
fiercely
down
upon
the
crawling
column
the
men
stumbled
and
fell
on
the
slippery
tracks
many
waggons
were
overturned
and
the
bloody
knees
and
muzzles
of
the
horses
bore
painful
witness
to
the
severity
of
the
march
the
bivouacs
were
more
comfortless
than
before
the
provision
train
lagged
far
in
rear
axes
there
were
none
and
had
not
the
afforded
a
supply
of
firewood
the
sufferings
of
the
troops
would
have
been
intense
as
it
was
despite
the
example
of
their
commander
they
pushed
forward
but
slowly
through
the
bitter
weather
jackson
was
everywhere
here
putting
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
of
a
gun
that
the
exhausted
team
could
no
longer
move
there
urging
the
wearied
soldiers
or
rebuking
the
officers
for
want
of
energy
attentive
as
he
was
to
the
health
and
comfort
of
his
men
in
quarters
on
the
line
of
march
he
looked
only
to
the
success
of
the
confederate
arms
the
hardships
of
the
winter
operations
were
to
him
but
a
necessary
concomitant
of
his
designs
and
it
mattered
but
little
if
the
weak
and
sickly
should
succumb
commanders
who
are
of
their
soldiers
lives
who
forget
that
their
men
have
voluntarily
offered
themselves
as
food
for
powder
often
miss
great
opportunities
to
die
doing
his
duty
was
to
jackson
the
most
desirable
consummation
of
the
soldier
existence
and
where
duty
was
concerned
or
victory
in
doubt
he
was
as
careless
of
life
and
suffering
as
napoleon
himself
the
of
an
individual
or

was
now
in

strike
at

marching
along

ohio
railway
in
the
direction
of
grafton
miles
west
of

in

to
leave

determined
as
a

step
to
destroy
the
bridge
by
which
the

railway
crossed
the
potomac
in
the
neighbourhood
of

the
federal
forces
at

frederick
drew
the
greater
part
of
their
supplies
from
the
west

so
serious
an
interruption
in
the
line
of
communication
would
compel
them
to
give
up
all
thought
of
offensive
enterprises
in
the
valley
but
the
sufferings
that
his
green
soldiers
had
undergone
had
sapped
their
discipline
loring
division
nearly
of
the
command
was
so
discontented
as
to
be
untrustworthy
it
was
useless
with
such
troops
to
dream
of
further
movements
among
the
inhospitable
hills
many
had
deserted
during
the
march
from
unger
store
many
had
succumbed
to
the
exposure
of
the
bivouacs
and
more
than
all
the
commander
had
been
disloyal
to
his
superior
although
a
regular
officer
of
long
service
he
had
permitted
himself
a
license
of
speech
which
was
absolutely
unjustifiable
and
throughout
the
operations
had
shown
his
unfitness
for
his
position
placed
under
the
command
of
an
officer
who
had
been
his
junior
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
his
sense
of
discipline
was
overborne
by
the
slight
to
his
vanity
and
not
for
the
first
time
nor
the
last
the
resentment
of
a
petty
mind
ruined
an
enterprise
which
would
have
profited
a
nation
compelled
to
abandon
his
projected
march
against
the
enemy
jackson
determined
to
leave
a
strong
garrison
in
romney
and
the
surrounding
district
while
the
remainder
of
the
force
withdrew
to
winchester
the
two
towns
were
connected
by
a
good
and
by
establishing
telegraphic
communication
between
them
he
believed
that
despite
the
federal
numbers
he
could
maintain
his
hold
on
these
important
posts
many
precautions
were
taken
to
secure
romney
from
surprise
three
militia
regiments
recruited
in
the
country
and
thus
not
only
familiar
with
every
road
but
able
to
procure
ample
information
were
posted
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
and
with
the
militia
were
left
three
companies
of
cavalry
one
of
which
had
already
been
employed
in
this
region
in
detailing
loring
division
as
the
garrison
of
romney
jackson
seems
to
have
made
a
grave
mistake
he
had
much
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
the
commander
and
the
men
were
already
demoralised
troops
unfit
to
march
against
the
enemy
were
not
the
men
to
be
trusted
with
the
security
of
an
important
outpost
within
thirty
miles
of
the
federal
camps
at
cumberland
far
from
their
supports
and
surrounded
by
bleak
and
lonely
mountains
a
man
of
wider
sympathy
with
human
weakness
and
with
less
rigid
ideas
of
discipline
might
possibly
have
arranged
matters
so
that
the
stonewall
brigade
might
have
remained
at
romney
while
loring
and
his
division
were
transferred
to
less
exacting
duties
and
more
comfortable
quarters
but
loring
division
constituted
of
jackson
force
and
romney
more
exposed
than
winchester
required
the
stronger
garrison
a
general
of
loring
temper
and
pretensions
would
scarcely
have
submitted
to
the
separation
of
his
brigades
and
would
probably
have
become
even
more
discontented
had
garnett
the
leader
of
the
stonewall
brigade
been
left
in
command
at
romney
while
he
himself
played
a
subordinate
part
at
winchester
it
is
only
too
possible
however
that
matters
were
past
mending
the
feeble
discipline
of
loring
troops
had
broken
down
their
enthusiasm
had
not
been
proof
against
the
physical
suffering
of
these
winter
operations
the
stonewall
brigade
on
the
other
hand
was
still
staunch
i
am
well
assured
wrote
jackson
at
this
time
that
had
an
order
been
issued
for
its
march
even
through
the
depth
of
winter
and
in
any
direction
it
would
have
sustained
its
reputation
for
although
it
was
not
under
fire
during
the
expedition
at
romney
yet
the
alacrity
with
which
it
responded
to
the
call
of
duty
and
overcame
obstacles
showed
that
it
was
still
animated
by
the
same
spirit
that
characterised
it
at
manassas
but
jackson
old

were
now

the

the
great
victory

had
done
so
much
to

returned

his
strategy

been
successful
he
had
driven
the

across
the
potomac
he
had
destroyed
for
a
time
an
important
line
of
supply
he
had
captured
a
few
prisoners
and
many
stores
and
this
with
a
loss
of
men
killed

the
federal
forces
along

were
far
superior
to
his
own
the
dispersion
of
these
forces
from
cumberland
to
frederick
a
distance
of
eighty
miles
had
doubtless
been
much
in
his
favour
but
when
he
marched
from
winchester
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
men
were
posted
at
frederick
at
hagerstown
at
williamsport
at
hancock
and
at
cumberland
and
romney
the
actual
effective
strength
of
these
garrisons
may
possibly
have
been
smaller
than
had
been
reported
but
such
were
the
numbers
which
he
had
to
take
into
consideration
when
planning
his
operations
it
would
appear
from
the
map
that
while
he
was
at
romney
federals
might
have
moved
out
from
williamsport
and
harper
ferry
and
have
cut
him
off
from
winchester
this
danger
had
to
be
kept
in
view
but
the
enemy
had
made
no
preparations
for
crossing
the
potomac
the
river
was
a
difficult
obstacle
and
banks
was
not
the
man
to
run
risks
any
attempt
banks
reported
to
mcclellan
to
intercept
the
enemy
would
have
been
unsuccessful
it
would
have
resulted
in
almost
certain
failure
to
cut
him
off
and
have
brought
an
exhausted
force
into
his
presence
to
fight
him
in
his
stronghold
at
winchester
in
any
case
it
promised
no
positive
prospect
of
success
nor
did
it
exclude
large
chances
of
disaster
volume

at
the
same
time
while
jackson
was
in
all
probability
perfectly
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
banks
refused
to
face
and
counted
on
that
commander
hesitation
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
manoeuvres
had
been
daring
and
that
the
mere
thought
of
the
enemy
superior
numbers
would
have
tied
down
a
general
of
inferior
ability
to
the
passive
defence
of
winchester
moreover
the
results
attained
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
trifling
loss
which
had
been
incurred
an
important
had
been
secured
the
development
of
union
sentiment
which
since
the
occupation
of
romney
by
the
federals
had
been
gradually
increasing
along
the
upper
potomac
would
be
checked
by
the
presence
of
southern
troops
a
base
for
further
operations
against
the
federal
detachments
in
west
virginia
had
been
established
and
a
fertile
region
opened
to
the
operations
of
the
confederate
commissaries
these
strategic
advantages
however
were
by
no
means
appreciated
by
the
people
of
virginia
the
sufferings
of
the
troops
appealed
more
forcibly
to
their
imagination
than
the
prospective
benefit
to
be
derived
by
the
confederacy
jackson
secrecy
as
absolute
as
that
of
the
grave
had
an
ill
effect
unable
to
comprehend
his
combinations
even
his
own
officers
ascribed
his
manoeuvres
to
a
restless
craving
for
personal
distinction
while
civilian
wiseacres
with
their
ears
full
of
the
exaggerated
stories
of
loring
stragglers
saw
in
the
relentless
energy
with
which
he
had
pressed
the
march
on
romney
not
only
the
evidence
of
a
callous
indifference
to
suffering
but
the
symptoms
of
a
diseased
mind
they
refused
to
consider
that
the
general
had
shared
the
hardships
of
the
troops
faring
as
simply
and
roughly
as
any
private
in
the
ranks
he
was
charged
with
partiality
to
the
stonewall
brigade
it
was
said
that
he
kept
it
in
the
rear
while
other
troops
were
constantly
thrust
into
danger
and
that
now
while
command
was
left
in
midwinter
in
an
alpine
region
almost
within
the
jaws
of
a
powerful
enemy
these
favoured
regiments
were
brought
back
to
the
comforts
and
hospitalities
of
the
town
whereas
in
truth
while
the
forces
in
romney
were
ordered
into
huts
the
brigade
was
three
miles
below
winchester
in
tents
and
under
the
most
rigid
discipline
dabney
volume

it
should
not
be
forgotten
however
that
loring
troops
were
little
more
as
yet
than
a
levy
of
armed
civilians
ignorant
of
war
and
this
was
one
reason
the
more
that
during
those
cruel
marches
the
hand
that
held
the
reins
should
have
been
a

genial

less
rigid

used

well

have
laughed
the
grumblers

fainting
by

the
glory

the
eccentric

would
have
cheered
them
like

there
are
occasions
when
both
officers
and
men
are
the
better
for
a
little
humouring
and
the
march
to
romney
was
one
a
few
words
of
hearty
praise
a
stirring
appeal
to
their
nobler
instincts
a
touch
of
sympathy
might
have
worked
wonders
but
whatever
of
personal
magnetism
existed
in
stonewall
jackson
found
no
utterance
in
words
whilst
his
soldiers
struggled
painfully
towards
romney
in
the
teeth
of
the
winter
storm
his
lips
were
never
opened
save
for
sharp
rebuke
or
peremptory
order
and
loring
men
had
some
reason
to
complain
of
his
fanatical
regard
for
the
very
letter
of
the
law

the
most
inclement
of
those

suspended

away

them
the

had
won

respect
and
confidence
which
go
so
far
towards
establishing

personal
ascendency
was

the

about

ask

to

was
urged

with

added

prevailed
upon
to
do

it

have
occurred
to

that
soldiers
in
the
near
vicinity
of

wherever
they
may
be
placed
must
always
be
subject
to
privations

that

the

respectfully
request
to
be

the
danger
apprehended
by
the
secretary
of
war
that
division
if
left
at
romney
might
be
cut
off
did
not
exist
general
lander
an
able
and
energetic
officer
now
in
command
of
the
federal
force
at
cumberland
had
put
forward
proposals
for
an
active
campaign
in
the
shenandoah
valley
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
such
an
enterprise
being
immediately
undertaken
the
potomac
was
still
a
formidable
obstacle
artillery
and
cavalry
were
both
deficient
the
troops
were
scattered
and
their
discipline
was
indifferent
command
according
to
his
official
despatches
was
more
like
an
armed
mob
than
an
army
ibid
pages
and
romney
therefore
was
in
little
danger
and
jackson
who
had
so
lately
been
in
contact
with
the
federal
troops
whose
cavalry
patrolled
the
banks
of
the
potomac
and
who
was
in
constant
receipt
of
information
of
the
enemy
attitude
and
condition
was
certainly
a
better
judge
of
what
was
probable
than
any
official
in
the
confederate
capital
there
were
doubtless
objections
to
the
retention
of
romney
an
enormous
army
in
the
intrenched
camp
at
washington
threatened
centreville
and
in
the
event
of
that
army
advancing
jackson
would
be
called
upon
to
reinforce
johnston
just
as
johnston
had
reinforced
beauregard
before
bull
run
with
the
greater
part
of
his
force
at
romney
such
an
operation
would
be
delayed
by
at
least
two
days
even
johnston
himself
although
careful
to
leave
his
subordinate
a
free
hand
suggested
that
the
occupation
of
romney
and
the
consequent
dispersion
of
jackson
force
might
enable
the
enemy
to
cut
in
effectively
between
the
valley
troops
and
the
main
army
it
is
beyond
question
however
that
jackson
had
carefully
studied
the
situation
there
was
no
danger
of
his
forgetting
that
his
was
merely
a
detached
force
or
of
his
overlooking
in
the
interests
of
his
own
projected
operations
the
more
important
interests
of
the
main
army
and
if
his
judgment
of
the
situation
differed
from
that
of
his
superior
it
was
because
he
had
been
indefatigable
in
his
search
for
information
he
had
agents
everywhere
i
have
taken
special
pains
he
writes
on
january
to
obtain
information
respecting
general
banks
but
i
have
not
been
informed
of
his
having
gone
east
i
will
see
what
can
be
effected
through
the
catholic
priests
at
martinsburg
volume
page
his
intelligence
was
more
ample
than
that
supplied
by
the
confederate
spies
in
washington
itself
no
reinforcements
could
reach
the
federals
on
the
potomac
without
his
knowledge
he
was
always
accurately
informed
of
the
strength
and
movements
of
their
detachments
nor
had
he
failed
to
take
the
precautions
which
minimise
the
evils
arising
from
dissemination
he
had
constructed
a
line
of
telegraph
from
charlestown
within
seven
miles
of
harper
ferry
to
winchester
and
another
line
was
to
have
been
constructed
to
romney
he
had
established
relays
of
couriers
through
his
district
by
this
means
he
could
communicate
with
hill
at
leesburg
in
three
hours
and
by
another
line
of
posts
with
johnston
at
centreville
but
his
chief
reason
for
believing
that
romney
might
be
occupied
without
risk
to
a
junction
between
himself
and
johnston
lay
in
the
impassable
condition
of
the
virginia
roads
mcclellan
huge
army
could
not
drag
its
guns
and
waggons
through
the
slough
of
mud
which
lay
between
washington
and
centreville
banks
command
at
frederick
was
in
no
condition
for
a
rapid
advance
either
upon
leesburg
or
on
winchester
and
it
was
evident
that
little
was
to
be
feared
from
lander
until
he
had
completed
the
work
on
which
he
was
now
actively
engaged
of
repairing
the
communications
which
jackson
raid
had
temporarily
interrupted
with
the
information
we
have
now
before
us
it
is
clear
that
jackson
view
of
the
situation
was
absolutely
correct
that
for
the
present
romney
might
be
advantageously
retained
and
recruiting
pushed
forward
in
this
section
of
virginia
if
when
mcclellan
advanced
the
confederates
were
to
confine
themselves
to
the
defensive
the
post
would
undoubtedly
have
to
be
abandoned
but
if
instead
of
tamely
surrendering
the
initiative
the
government
were
to
adopt
the
bolder
strategy
which
jackson
had
already
advocated
and
johnston
army
moving
westward
to
the
valley
were
to
utilise
the
natural
line
of
invasion
by
way
of
harper
ferry
the
occupation
of
romney
would
secure
the
flank
and
give
the
invading
force
a
fertile
district
from
which
to
draw
supplies
it
was
not
however
on
the
secretary
misconception
of
the
situation
that
jackson
request
for
relief
was
based
nor
was
it
the
slur
on
his
judgment
that
led
him
to
resign
the
injury
that
had
been
inflicted
by
benjamin
unfortunate
letter
was
not
personal
to
himself
it
affected
the
whole
army
it
was
a
direct
blow
to
discipline
and
struck
at
the
very
heart
of
military
efficiency
not
only
would
jackson
himself
be
unable
to
enforce
his
authority
over
troops
who
had
so
successfully
defied
his
orders
but
the
whole
edifice
of
command
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
confederacy
would
if
he
tamely
submitted
to
the
extraordinary
action
be
shaken
to
its
foundations
johnston
still
smarting
under
davis
rejection
of
his
strategical
views
felt
this
as
acutely
as
did
jackson
the
discipline
of
the
army
he
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
war
can
not
be
maintained
under
such
circumstances
the
direct
tendency
of
such
orders
is
to
insulate
the
commanding
general
from
his
troops
to
diminish
his
moral
as
well
as
his
official
control
and
to
harass
him
with
the
constant
fear
that
his
most
matured
plans
may
be
marred
by
orders
from
his
government
which
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
anticipate
volume
pages
and
to
jackson
he
wrote
advising
the
withdrawal
of
his
resignation
under
ordinary
circumstances
a
due
sense
of
one
own
dignity
as
well
as
care
for
professional
character
and
official
rights
would
demand
such
a
course
as
yours
but
the
character
of
this
war
the
great
energy
exhibited
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
danger
in
which
our
very
existence
as
an
independent
people
lies
requires
sacrifices
from
us
all
who
have
been
educated
as
soldiers
i
receive
the
information
of
the
order
of
which
you
have
such
cause
to
complain
from
your
letter
is
not
that
as
great
an
official
wrong
to
me
as
the
order
itself
to
you
let
us
dispassionately
reason
with
the
government
on
this
subject
of
command
and
if
we
fail
to
influence
its
practice
then
ask
to
be
relieved
from
positions
the
authority
of
which
is
exercised
by
the
war
department
while
the
responsibilities
are
left
to
us
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
detain
your
letter
to
make
this
appeal
to
your
patriotism
not
merely
from
common
feelings
of
personal
regard
but
from
the
official
opinion
which
makes
me
regard
you
as
necessary
to
the
service
of
the
country
in
your
present
position
volume
pages
and
but
johnston
when
he
wrote
was
not
aware
of
the
remonstrance
of
loring
officers
his
protest
in
his
letter
to
the
secretary
of
war
deprecated
the
action
of
the
department
in
ignoring
the
authority
of
the
military
chiefs
it
had
no
reference
to
the
graver
evil
of
yielding
to
the
representations
of
irresponsible
subordinates
considering
the
circumstances
as
he
believed
them
to
exist
his
advice
was
doubtless
prudent
but
it
found
jackson
in
no
compromising
mood
sacrifices
he
exclaimed
have
i
not
made
them
what
is
my
life
here
but
a
daily
sacrifice
nor
shall
i
ever
withhold
sacrifices
for
my
country
where
they
will
avail
anything
i
intend
to
serve
here
anywhere
in
any
way
i
can
even
if
it
be
as
a
private
soldier
but
if
this
method
of
making
war
is
to
prevail
the
country
is
ruined
my
duty
to
virginia
requires
that
i
shall
utter
my
protest
against
it
in
the
most
energetic
form
in
my
power
and
that
is
to
resign
the
authorities
at
richmond
must
be
taught
a
lesson
or
the
next
victims
of
their
meddling
will
be
johnston
and
lee
fortunately
for
the
confederacy
the
virginia
officers
possessed
a
staunch
supporter
in
the
governor
of
the
state
letcher
knew
jackson
worth
and
he
knew
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
already
held
by
the
virginia
people
the
battle
of
manassas
had
attained
the
dignity
of
a
great
historical
event
and
those
whose
share
in
the
victory
had
been
conspicuous
were
regarded
with
the
same
respect
as
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
in
the
spring
of
manassas
stood
alone
the
supreme
incident
of
the
war
its
fame
was
not
yet
overshadowed
by
mightier
conflicts
and
it
had
taken
rank
in
the
popular
mind
with
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
jackson
at
the
same
time
that
he
addressed
johnston
wrote
to
letcher
it
is
possible
that
he
anticipated
the
course
the
governor
would
adopt
he
certainly
took
care
that
if
a
protest
were
made
it
should
be
backed
with
convincing
argument
the
order
from
the
war
department
he
wrote
was
given
without
consulting
me
and
is
abandoning
to
the
enemy
what
has
cost
much
preparation
expense
and
exposure
to
secure
is
in
direct
conflict
with
my
military
plans
implies
a
want
of
confidence
in
my
capacity
to
judge
when
general
loring
troops
should
fall
back
and
is
an
attempt
to
control
military
operations
in
details
from
the
secretary
desk
at
a
distance
as
a
single
order
like
that
of
the
secretary
may
destroy
the
entire
fruits
of
a
campaign
i
can
not
reasonably
expect
if
my
operations
are
thus
to
be
interfered
with
to
be
of
much
service
in
the
field
if
i
ever
acquired
through
the
blessing
of
providence
any
influence
over
troops
this
undoing
my
work
by
the
secretary
may
greatly
diminish
that
influence
i
regard
the
recent
expedition
as
a
great
success
i
desire
to
say
nothing
against
the
secretary
of
war
i
take
it
for
granted
that
he
has
done
what
he
believes
to
be
best
but
i
regard
such
policy
as
ruinous
memoirs
pages
and
this
letter
had
the
desired
result
not
content
with
reminding
jackson
of
the
effect
his
resignation
would
have
on
the
people
of
virginia
and
begging
him
to
withdraw
it
governor
letcher
took
the
secretary
of
war
to
task
benjamin
who
had
probably
acted
in
ignorance
rather
than
in
defiance
of
the
military
necessities
at
once
gave
way
governor
letcher
assured
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
government
to
interfere
with
the
plans
of
the
general
withdrew
the
resignation
jackson
had
already
yielded
to
his
representations
in
this
transaction
says
his
chief
of
the
staff
jackson
gained
one
of
his
most
important
victories
for
the
confederate
states
had
the
system
of
encouragement
to
the
insubordination
of
inferiors
and
of
interference
with
the
responsibilities
of
commanders
in
the
field
which
was
initiated
in
his
case
become
established
military
success
could
only
have
been
won
by
accident
by
his
firmness
the
evil
usage
was
arrested
and
a
lesson
impressed
both
upon
the
government
and
the
people
of
the
south
dabney
volume
page
that
the
soldier
is
but
the
servant
of
the
statesman
as
war
is
but
an
instrument
of
diplomacy
no
educated
soldier
will
deny
politics
must
always
exercise
a
supreme
influence
on
strategy
yet
it
can
not
be
gainsaid
that
interference
with
the
commanders
in
the
field
is
fraught
with
the
gravest
danger
benjamin
action
was
without
excuse
in
listening
to
the
malcontents
he
ignored
the
claims
of
discipline
in
cancelling
jackson
orders
he
struck
a
blow
at
the
confidence
of
the
men
in
their
commander
in
directing
that
romney
should
not
be
held
he
decided
on
a
question
which
was
not
only
purely
military
but
of
which
the
man
on
the
spot
actually
in
touch
with
the
situation
and
with
the
enemy
could
alone
be
judge
the
inexpediency
of
evacuating
romney
was
soon
made
apparent
the
enemy
reoccupied
the
village
seized
moorefield
and
with
the
valley
of
the
south
branch
in
their
possession
threatened
the
rear
of
edward
johnson
position
on
the
alleghany
mountain
so
closely
that
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
three
fertile
counties
were
thus
abandoned
to
the
enemy
and
the
confederate
sympathisers
in
virginia
were
proportionately
discouraged
even
johnston
a
most
able
and
experienced
soldier
although
he
was
evidently
apprehensive
that
jackson
front
was
too
extended
forbore
to
do
more
than
warn
nor
was
his
interference
the
crown
of
benjamin
offence
the
omniscient
lawyer
asked
no
advice
but
believing
as
many
still
believe
that
neither
special
knowledge
nor
practical
acquaintance
with
the
working
of
the
military
machine
is
necessary
in
order
to
manoeuvre
armies
he
had
acted
entirely
on
his
own
initiative
it
was
indeed
time
that
he
received
a
lesson
well
would
it
have
been
for
the
confederacy
had
the
president
himself
been
wise
enough
to
apply
the
warning
to
its
full
extent
we
have
already
seen
that
after
the
victory
of
manassas
in
his
capacity
of
he
refused
to
denude
the
southern
coasts
of
their
garrisons
in
order
to
reinforce
johnston
army
and
strike
a
decisive
blow
in
northern
territory
had
he
but
once
recognised
that
he
too
was
an
amateur
that
it
was
impossible
for
one
man
to
combine
effectively
in
his
own
person
the
duties
of
head
of
the
government
and
of
he
would
have
handed
over
the
management
of
his
huge
armies
and
the
direction
of
all
military
movements
to
the
most
capable
soldier
the
confederacy
could
produce
capable
soldiers
were
not
wanting
and
had
the
control
of
military
operations
been
frankly
committed
to
a
trained
strategist
and
the
military
resources
of
the
southern
states
been
placed
unreservedly
at
the
disposal
of
either
lee
or
johnston
combined
operations
would
have
taken
the
place
of
disjointed
enterprises
and
the
full
strength
of
the
country
have
been
concentrated
at
the
decisive
point
it
can
hardly
however
be
imputed
as
a
fault
to
davis
that
he
did
not
anticipate
a
system
which
achieved
such
astonishing
success
in
prussia
campaigns
of
and
it
was
not
through
vanity
alone
that
he
retained
in
his
own
hands
the
supreme
control
of
military
affairs
the
confederate
system
of
government
was
but
an
imitation
of
that
which
existed
in
the
united
states
and
in
washington
as
in
richmond
the
president
was
not
only
in
name
but
the
arbiter
on
all
questions
of
strategy
and
organisation
while
to
go
still
further
back
the
english
cabinet
had
exercised
the
same
power
since
parliament
became
supreme
the
american
people
may
be
forgiven
for
their
failure
to
recognise
the
deplorable
results
of
the
system
they
had
inherited
from
the
the
english
people
had
been
equally
blind
and
in
their
case
there
was
no
excuse
the
mismanagement
of
the
national
resources
in
the
war
with
france
was
condoned
by
the
victories
of
wellington
the
vicious
conceptions
of
the
government
responsible
for
so
many
useless
enterprises
for
waste
of
life
of
treasure
of
opportunity
were
lost
in
the
blaze
of
triumph
in
which
the
struggle
ended
forty
years
later
it
had
been
forgotten
that
the
cabinet
of
had
done
its
best
to
lose
the
battle
of
waterloo
the
lessons
of
the
great
war
were
disregarded
and
the
cabinet
of
to
was
allowed
to
work
its
will
on
the
army
of
the
crimea
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
during
the
war
of
secession
for
the
three
years
the
control
of
the
armies
of
the
north
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
cabinet
the
balance
of
success
lay
with
the
confederates
but
in
march
grant
was
appointed
lincoln
abdicated
his
military
functions
in
his
favour
and
the
secretary
of
war
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
comply
with
his
requisitions
then
for
the
first
time
the
enormous
armies
of
the
union
were
manoeuvred
in
harmonious
combination
and
the
superior
force
was
exerted
to
its
full
effect
nor
is
it
less
significant
that
during
the
most
critical
period
of
the
campaign
the
most
glorious
to
the
confederacy
lee
was
of
the
southern
armies
but
when
lee
left
richmond
for
the
northern
border
davis
once
more
assumed
supreme
control
retaining
it
until
it
was
too
late
to
stave
off
ruin
yet
the
southern
soldiers
had
never
to
complain
of
such
constant
interference
on
the
part
of
the
cabinet
as
had
the
northern
and
to
jackson
it
was
due
that
each
confederate
general
with
few
exceptions
was
henceforward
left
unhampered
in
his
own
theatre
of
operations
his
threat
of
resignation
at
least
effected
this
and
although
the
president
still
managed
or
mismanaged
the
grand
operations
the
secretary
of
war
was
muzzled
it
might
be
objected
that
in
this
instance
jackson
showed
little
respect
for
the
discipline
he
so
rigidly
enforced
and
that
in
the
critical
situation
of
the
confederacy
his
action
was
a
breach
of
duty
which
was
almost
disloyalty
without
doubt
his
resignation
would
have
seriously
embarrassed
the
government
to
some
degree
at
least
the
confidence
of
both
the
people
and
the
army
in
the
administration
would
have
become
impaired
but
jackson
was
fighting
for
a
principle
which
was
of
even
more
importance
than
subordination
foreseeing
as
he
did
the
certain
results
of
civilian
meddling
submission
to
the
secretary
orders
would
have
been
no
virtue
his
presence
with
the
army
would
hardly
have
counterbalanced
the
untrammelled
exercise
of
benjamin
military
sagacity
and
the
inevitable
decay
of
discipline
it
was
not
the
course
of
a
weak
man
an
apathetic
man
or
a
selfish
man
we
may
imagine
jackson
eating
his
heart
out
at
lexington
while
the
war
was
raging
on
the
frontier
and
the
stonewall
brigade
was
fighting
manfully
under
another
leader
against
the
hosts
of
the
invader
the
independence
of
his
country
was
the
most
intense
of
all
his
earthly
desires
and
to
leave
the
forefront
of
the
fight
before
that
desire
had
been
achieved
would
have
been
more
to
him
than
most
he
would
have
sacrificed
far
more
in
resigning
than
in
remaining
and
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
a
brilliant
success
and
the
rapid
termination
of
the
war
would
place
benjamin
apparently
in
the
right
how
would
jackson
look
then
what
would
be
the
reputation
of
the
man
who
had
quitted
the
army
on
what
would
have
been
considered
a
mere
point
of
etiquette
in
the
very
heat
of
the
campaign
no
ordinary
man
would
have
faced
the
alternative
and
have
risked
his
reputation
in
order
to
teach
the
rulers
of
his
country
a
lesson
which
might
never
reach
them
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
jackson
had
not
yet
proved
himself
indispensable
he
had
done
good
work
at
manassas
but
so
had
others
his
name
was
scarcely
known
beyond
the
confines
of
his
own
state
and
virginia
had
several
officers
of
higher
reputation
his
immediate
superiors
knew
his
value
but
the
confederate
authorities
as
their
action
proved
placed
little
dependence
on
his
judgment
and
in
all
probability
set
no
special
store
upon
his
services
there
was
undoubtedly
every
chance
had
not
governor
letcher
intervened
that
his
resignation
would
have
been
accepted
his
letter
then
to
the
secretary
of
war
was
no
mere
threat
the
outcome
of
injured
vanity
but
the
earnest
and
deliberate
protest
of
a
man
who
was
ready
to
sacrifice
even
his
own
good
name
to
benefit
his
country
the
negotiations
which
followed
his
application
to
resign
occupied
some
time
he
remained
at
winchester
and
the
pleasant
home
where
he
and
his
wife
had
found
such
kindly
welcome
was
the
scene
of
much
discussion
governor
letcher
was
not
alone
in
his
endeavours
to
alter
his
decision
many
were
the
letters
that
poured
in
from
every
class
of
virginians
from
public
men
and
private
came
the
same
appeal
but
until
he
was
convinced
that
virginia
would
suffer
by
his
action
jackson
was
deaf
to
argument
he
had
not
yet
realised
the
measure
of
confidence
which
he
had
won
to
those
who
sought
to
move
him
by
saying
that
his
country
could
not
spare
his
services
or
by
speaking
of
his
hold
upon
the
troops
he
replied
that
they
greatly
overestimated
his
capacity
for
usefulness
and
that
his
place
would
readily
be
filled
by
a
better
man
that
many
of
his
friends
were
deeply
incensed
with
the
secretary
of
war
was
only
natural
and
his
conduct
was
bitterly
denounced
but
jackson
not
only
forbore
to
criticise
but
in
his
presence
all
criticism
was
forbidden
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
deeply
wounded
he
could
be
angry
when
he
chose
and
his
anger
was
none
the
less
fierce
because
it
was
habitually
controlled
he
never
forgave
davis
for
his
want
of
wisdom
after
manassas
and
indeed
in
future
campaigns
the
action
was
sufficient
to
exasperate
the
most
patriotic
of
his
generals
but
during
this
time
of
trouble
not
a
word
escaped
jackson
which
showed
those
nearest
him
that
his
equanimity
was
disturbed
anticipating
that
he
would
be
ordered
to
the
military
institute
he
was
even
delighted
says
his
wife
at
the
prospect
of
returning
home
the
reason
of
his
calmness
is
not
far
to
seek
he
had
come
to
the
determination
that
it
was
his
duty
to
resign
not
we
may
be
certain
without
prayer
and
and
when
jackson
saw
what
his
duty
was
all
other
considerations
were
soon
dismissed
he
was
content
to
leave
the
future
in
higher
hands
it
had
been
so
with
him
when
the
question
of
secession
was
first
broached
it
was
soon
after
the
election
of
wrote
one
of
his
clerical
friends
when
the
country
was
beginning
to
heave
in
the
agony
of
dissolution
we
had
just
risen
from
morning
prayers
in
his
own
house
where
at
that
time
i
was
a
guest
filled
with
gloom
i
was
lamenting
in
strong
language
the
condition
and
prospect
of
our
beloved
country
said
he
christians
be
disturbed
about
the
dissolution
of
the
union
it
can
only
come
by
god
permission
and
will
only
be
permitted
if
for
his
people
good
i
can
not
see
why
we
should
be
distressed
about
such
things
whatever
be
their
consequence
for
the
next
month
the
stonewall
brigade
and
its
commander
enjoyed
a
rest
the
federals
on
loring
withdrawal
contented
themselves
with
holding
romney
and
moorefield
and
on
recommendation
loring
and
part
of
his
troops
were
transferred
elsewhere
the
enemy
showed
no
intention
of
advancing
the
season
was
against
them
the
winter
was
abnormally
wet
the
potomac
was
higher
than
it
had
been
for
twenty
years
and
the
virginia
roads
had
disappeared
in
mud
in
order
to
encourage
amongst
the
men
furloughs
were
liberally
granted
by
the
authorities
at
richmond
and
for
a
short
season
the
din
of
arms
was
unheard
on
the
shenandoah
this
peaceful
time
was
one
of
unalloyed
happiness
to
jackson
the
country
round
winchester
the
gently
rolling
ridges
surmounted
by
groves
of
forest
trees
the
great
north
mountains
to
the
westward
rising
sharply
from
the
valley
the
cosy
villages
and
comfortable
farms
and
in
the
clear
blue
distance
to
the
south
the
towering
peaks
of
the
massanuttons
is
a
picture
not
easily
forgotten
and
the
little
town
quiet
and
with
its
ample
gardens
and
pavements
is
not
unworthy
of
its
surroundings
up
a
narrow
street
shaded
by
silver
maples
stood
the
manse
not
far
from
the
headquarter
offices
and
here
when
his
daily
work
was
done
jackson
found
the
happiness
of
a
home
brightened
by
the
winning
ways
and
attractive
presence
of
his
wife
with
his
host
he
had
much
in
common
they
were
members
of
the
same
church
and
neither
yielded
to
the
other
in
his
high
standard
of
morality
the
great
bookcases
of
the
manse
were
well
stocked
with
appropriate
literature
and
the
cultured
intellect
of
graham
met
more
than
the
somewhat
abstruse
problems
with
which
jackson
powerful
brain
delighted
to
wrestle
but
jackson
and
his
host
even
had
they
been
so
inclined
were
not
permitted
to
devote
their
whole
leisure
to
theological
discussion
children
laughter
broke
in
upon
their
arguments
the
young
staff
officers
with
the
bright
eyes
of
the
winchester
ladies
as
a
lure
found
a
welcome
by
that
hospitable
hearth
and
the
war
was
not
so
absorbing
a
topic
as
to
drive
gaiety
afield
the
sedate
manse
was
like
to
lose
its
character
there
were
times
when
the
house
overflowed
with
music
and
with
merriment
and
sounds
at
which
a
scotch
elder
would
have
shuddered
were
heard
far
out
in
the
street
and
the
fun
and
frolic
were
not
confined
to
the
more
youthful
members
of
the
household
the
stonewall
brigade
would
hardly
have
been
surprised
had
they
seen
their
general
surrounded
by
ponderous
volumes
gravely
investigating
the
teaching
of
departed
commentators
or
joining
with
quiet
fervour
in
the
family
devotions
but
had
they
seen
him
running
down
the
stairs
with
an
urchin
on
his
shoulders
laughing
like
a
schoolboy
they
would
have
refused
to
credit
the
evidence
of
their
senses
so
the
months
wore
on
we
spent
says
jackson
as
happy
a
winter
as
ever
falls
to
the
lot
of
mortals
upon
earth
but
the
brigade
was
not
forgotten
nor
the
enemy
every
day
the
virginia
regiments
improved
in
drill
and
discipline
the
scouts
were
busy
on
the
border
and
not
a
movement
of
the
federal
forces
was
unobserved
a
vigilant
watch
was
indeed
necessary
the
snows
had
melted
and
the
roads
were
slowly
drying
the
army
of
the
potomac
mcclellan
great
host
numbering
over
men
encamped
around
washington
hardly
more
than
a
day
march
distant
from
centreville
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
confederates
who
held
the
intrenchments
at
centreville
and
manassas
junction
general
lander
was
dead
but
shields
a
veteran
of
the
mexican
campaign
had
succeeded
him
and
the
force
at
both
romney
and
frederick
had
been
increased
in
the
west
things
were
going
badly
for
the
new
republic
the
union
troops
had
overrun
kentucky
missouri
and
the
greater
part
of
tennessee
a
confederate
army
had
been
defeated
confederate
forts
captured
and
the
amphibious
power
of
the
north
had
already
been
effectively
exerted
various
towns
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
had
been
occupied
not
one
of
the
european
powers
had
evinced
a
decided
intention
of
espousing
the
confederate
cause
and
the
blockade
still
exercised
its
relentless
pressure
it
was
not
however
until
the
end
of
february
that
the
great
host
beyond
the
potomac
showed
symptoms
of
approaching
movement
but
it
had
long
been
evident
that
both
winchester
and
centreville
must
soon
be
abandoned
johnston
was
as
powerless
before
mcclellan
as
jackson
before
banks
even
if
by
bringing
fortification
to
their
aid
they
could
hold
their
ground
against
the
direct
attack
of
far
superior
numbers
they
could
not
prevent
their
intrenchments
being
turned
mcclellan
had
at
his
disposal
the
naval
resources
of
the
north
it
would
be
no
difficult
task
to
transfer
his
army
by
the
broad
reaches
of
the
potomac
and
the
chesapeake
to
some
point
on
the
virginia
coast
and
to
intervene
between
centreville
and
richmond
at
the
same
time
the
army
of
western
virginia
which
was
now
under
command
of
general
fremont
might
threaten
jackson
in
rear
by
moving
on
staunton
from
beverley
and
the
great
kanawha
while
banks
assailed
him
in
front
fortunately
for
the
confederates
this
army
had
been
reduced
to
men
and
the
want
of
transport
together
with
the
condition
of
the
mountain
roads
kept
it
stationary
until
the
weather
improved
johnston
was
already
preparing
to
retreat
jackson
reluctant
to
abandon
a
single
acre
of
his
beloved
valley
to
the
enemy
was
nevertheless
constrained
to
face
the
possibilities
of
such
a
course
his
wife
was
sent
back
to
her
father
home
in
the
same
train
that
conveyed
his
sick
to
staunton
baggage
and
stores
were
removed
to
mount
jackson
up
the
shenandoah
valley
and
his
little
army
which
had
now
been
increased
to
three
brigades
or
men
all
told
was
ordered
to
break
up
its
camps
federals
had
gradually
assembled
between
frederick
and
romney
banks
who
commanded
the
whole
force
was
preparing
to
advance
and
his
outposts
were
already
established
on
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
but
when
the
confederate
column
filed
through
the
streets
of
winchester
it
moved
not
south
but
north
such
was
jackson
idea
of
a
retreat
to
march
towards
the
enemy
not
away
from
him
to
watch
his
every
movement
to
impose
upon
him
with
a
bold
front
to
delay
him
to
the
utmost
and
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
that
might
offer
for
offensive
action
shortly
before
their
departure
the
troops
received
a
reminder
that
their
leader
brooked
no
trifling
with
orders
intoxicating
liquors
were
forbidden
in
the
confederate
lines
but
the
regulation
was
systematically
evaded
and
the
friends
of
the
soldiers
smuggled
in
supplies
when
this
breach
of
discipline
was
discovered
jackson
put
a
stop
to
the
traffic
by
an
order
which
put
the
punishment
on
the
right
shoulders
every
waggon
that
came
into
camp
was
to
be
searched
and
if
any
liquor
were
found
it
was
to
be
spilled
out
and
the
waggon
horses
turned
over
to
the
quartermaster
for
the
public
service
nevertheless
when
they
left
winchester
so
jackson
wrote
to
his
wife
the
troops
were
in
excellent
spirits
and
their
somewhat
hypochondriacal
general
had
never
for
years
enjoyed
more
perfect
health
a
blessing
for
which
he
had
more
reason
to
be
thankful
than
the
federals
map
the
valley
showing
west
monterey
north
hancock
south
charlottesville
and
east
manassas
junction
note
the
evils
of
civilian
control
it
is
well
worth
noticing
that
the
interference
of
both
the
union
and
confederate
cabinets
was
not
confined
to
the
movements
and
location
of
the
troops
the
organisation
of
the
armies
was
very
largely
the
work
of
the
civilian
authorities
and
the
advice
of
the
soldiers
was
very
generally
disregarded
the
results
it
need
hardly
be
said
were
deplorable
the
northern
wiseacres
considered
cavalry
an
encumbrance
and
a
staff
a
mere
ornamental
appendage
mcclellan
in
consequence
was
always
in
difficulties
for
the
want
of
mounted
regiments
and
while
many
regular
officers
were
retained
in
the
command
of
batteries
and
companies
the
important
duties
of
the
staff
had
sometimes
to
be
assigned
to
volunteers
the
men
too
at
first
were
asked
to
serve
for
three
months
only
that
is
they
were
permitted
to
take
their
discharge
directly
they
had
learned
the
rudiments
of
their
work
again
instead
of
the
ranks
of
the
old
regiments
being
filled
up
as
casualties
occurred
the
armies
despite
mcclellan
protests
were
recruited
by
raw
regiments
commanded
by
untrained
officers
davis
knowing
something
of
war
certainly
showed
more
wisdom
the
organisation
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
left
in
great
measure
to
general
lee
so
from
the
very
first
the
southerners
had
sufficient
cavalry
and
as
good
a
staff
as
could
be
got
together
the
soldiers
however
were
only
enlisted
at
first
for
twelve
months
yet
lee
says
lord
wolseley
pleaded
in
favour
of
the
engagement
being
for
the
duration
of
the
war
but
he
pleaded
in
vain
and
it
was
not
for
many
months
that
the
politicians
could
be
induced
to
cancel
the
regulation
under
which
the
men
elected
their
officers
the
president
too
while
the
markets
of
europe
were
still
open
neglected
to
lay
in
a
store
of
munitions
of
war
it
was
not
till
may
that
an
order
was
sent
across
the
seas
and
then
only
for
muskets
the
commissariat
department
moreover
was
responsible
to
the
president
and
not
to
the
commander
of
the
armies
this
perhaps
was
the
worst
fault
of
all
it
would
seem
impossible
that
such
mistakes
in
an
intelligent
community
should
be
permitted
to
recur
yet
in
face
of
the
fact
that
only
when
the
commanders
have
been
given
a
free
hand
as

a

been

that
the

was

the

he
wrote
are
turnpikes
and
in

condition
the
enemy
is
weak
demoralised
and
depressed
but
mcclellan
who
held
command
of
all
the
federal
forces
had
no
mind
to
expose
even
a
detachment
to
defeat
the
main
confederate
army
at
centreville
could
at
any
moment
dispatch
reinforcements
by
railway
to
the

reversing
the
strategic
movement
which
had
won

run
while
the
army
of

held
fast
by
the
mud
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
banks
was
therefore
ordered
to
occupy
the
line
charlestown
to
martinsburg
some
miles
from
winchester
to
cover
the
reconstruction
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
to
accumulate
supplies
preparatory
to
a
further
advance
the
troops
however
did
not
approve
such
cautious
strategy
their
appetite
for
work
according
to
their
commander
was
very
sharp
banks
himself
was
not
less
eager
if
left
to
our
own
discretion
he
wrote
to
mcclellan
chief
of

the
general
desire
will
be
to
move

general
hill
acting
under
instructions
fell
back
from
leesburg
and
two
days
later
johnston
destroying
the
railways
abandoned
centreville
the
confederate
had
decided
to
withdraw
to
near
orange
court
house
trebling
his
distance
from
washington
and
surrendering
much
territory
but
securing
in
return
important
strategical
advantages
protected
by
the
rapidan
a
stream
unfordable
in
spring
he
was
well
placed
to
meet
a
federal
advance
and
also
by
a
rapid
march
to
anticipate
any
force
which
might
be
transported
by
water
and
landed
close
to
richmond
jackson
was
now
left
isolated
in
the
valley
the
nearest
confederate
infantry
were
at
culpeper
court
house
beyond
the
blue
ridge
nearly
sixty
miles
in
his
front
within
two
easy
marches
was
an
army
just
seven
times
his
strength
at
romney
another
detachment
of
several
thousand
men
and
a
large
force
in
the
alleghanies
he
was
in
no
hurry
however
to
abandon
winchester
johnston
had
intended
that
when
the
main
army
fell
back
towards
richmond
his
detachments
should
follow
suit
jackson
found
a
loophole
in
his
instructions
which
gave
him
full
liberty
of
action
i
greatly
desire
he
wrote
to
johnston
on
march
to
hold
this
place
winchester
so
far
as
may
be
consistent
with
your
views
and
plans
and
am
making
arrangements
by
constructing
works
to
make
a
stand
though
you
desired
me
some
time
since
to
fall
back
in
the
event
of
yourself
and
general
hill
doing
so
yet
in
your
letter
of
the
inst
you
say
delay
the
enemy
as
long
as
you
can
i
have
felt
justified
in
remaining
here
for
the
present
and
now
general
that
hill
has
fallen
back
can
you
not
send
him
over
here
i
greatly
need
such
an
officer
one
who
can
be
sent
off
as
occasion
may
offer
against
an
exposed
detachment
of
the
enemy
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
it
i
believe
that
if
you
can
spare
hill
and
let
him
move
here
at
once
you
will
never
have
occasion
to
regret
it
the
very
idea
of
reinforcements
coming
to
winchester
would
i
think
be
a
damper
to
the
enemy
in
addition
to
the
fine
effect
that
would
be
produced
on
our
own
troops
already
in
fine
spirits
but
if
you
can
not
spare
hill
can
you
not
send
me
some
other
troops
if
we
can
not
be
successful
in
defeating
the
enemy
should
he
advance
a
kind
providence
may
enable
us
to
inflict
a
terrible
wound
and
effect
a
safe
retreat
in
the
event
of
having
to
fall
back
i
will
keep
myself
on
the
alert
with
respect
to
communications
between
us
so
as
to
be
able
to
join
you
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
if
such
a
movement
becomes
necessary
volume
page
this
letter
is
characteristic
when
jackson
asked
for
reinforcements
the
cause
of
the
south
seemed
hopeless
her
western
armies
were
retiring
defeated
and
demoralised
several
of
her
atlantic
towns
had
fallen
to
the
federal
navy
assisted
by
strong
landing
parties
the
army
on
which
she
depended
for
the
defence
of
richmond
yielding
to
the
irresistible
presence
of
far
superior
numbers
was
retreating
into
the
interior
of
virginia
there
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
help
from
beyond
the
sea
the
opportunity
for
a
great
counterstroke
had
been
suffered
to
escape
her
forces
were
too
small
for
aught
but
defensive
action
and
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
that
she
could
hold
her
own
against
mcclellan
magnificently
appointed
host
events
said
davis
at
this
time
have
cast
on
our
arms
and
hopes
the
gloomiest
shadows
but
from
the
valley
the
northern
outpost
of
the
confederate
armies
where
the
danger
was
most
threatening
and
the
means
of
defence
the
most
inadequate
came
not
a
whisper
of
apprehension
the
troops
that
held
the
border
were
but
a
handful
but
jackson
knew
enough
of
war
to
be
aware
that
victory
does
not
always
side
with
the
big
battalions
neither
johnston
nor
davis
had
yet
recognised
as
he
did
the
weak
joint
in
the
federal
harness
why
should
the
appearance
of
hill
brigade
at
winchester
discourage
banks
johnston
had
fallen
back
to
the
rapidan
and
there
was
now
no
fear
of
the
confederates
detaching
troops
suddenly
from
manassas
why
should
the
bare
idea
that
reinforcements
were
coming
up
embarrass
the
federals
the
letter
itself
does
not
indeed
supply
a
definite
answer
jackson
was
always
most
guarded
in
his
correspondence
and
if
he
could
possibly
avoid
it
he
never
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
information
on
which
his
plans
were
based
his
staff
officers
however
after
the
campaign
was
over
were
generally
enlightened
as
to
the
motive
of
his
actions
and
we
are
thus
enabled
to
fill
the
gap
letter
from
major
hotchkiss
to
the
author
jackson
demanded
reinforcements
for
the
one
reason
that
a
blow
struck
near
winchester
would
cause
alarm
in
washington
the
communications
of
the
federal
capital
with
both
the
north
and
west
passed
through
or
close
to
harper
ferry
and
the
passage
over
the
potomac
which
banks
was
now
covering
was
thus
the
most
sensitive
point
in
the
invader
front
well
aware
as
indeed
was
every
statesman
and
every
general
in
virginia
of
the
state
of
public
feeling
in
the
north
jackson
saw
with
more
insight
than
others
the
effect
that
was
likely
to
be
produced
should
the
government
the
press
and
the
people
of
the
federal
states
have
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
capital
of
the
union
was
in
danger
if
the
idea
of
playing
on
the
fears
of
his
opponents
by
means
of
the
weak
detachment
under
jackson
ever
suggested
itself
to
johnston
he
may
be
forgiven
if
he
dismissed
it
as
chimerical
for
jackson
hill
to
threaten
with
any
useful
result
a
capital
which
was
defended
by
seemed
hardly
within
the
bounds
of
practical
strategy
johnston
had
nevertheless
determined
to
turn
the
situation
to
account
in
order
to
protect
the
passages
of
the
upper
potomac
mcclellan
had
been
compelled
to
disseminate
his
army
between
his
main
body
south
of
washington
and
his
right
wing
under
banks
was
a
gap
of
fifty
miles
and
this
separation
johnston
was
determined
should
be
maintained
the
president
to
whom
he
had
referred
jackson
letter
was
unable
to
spare
the
reinforcements
therein
requested
and
the
defence
of
the
valley
was
left
to
the
men
encamped
at
winchester
jackson
was
permitted
to
use
his
own
judgment
as
to
his
own
position
but
something
more
was
required
of
him
than
the
mere
protection
of
a
tract
of
territory
he
was
to
endeavour
to
employ
the
invaders
in
the
valley
without
exposing
himself
to
the
danger
of
defeat
by
keeping
so
near
the
enemy
as
to
prevent
his
making
any
considerable
detachment
to
reinforce
mcclellan
but
not
so
near
that
he
might
be
compelled
to
fight
johnston
narrative
to
carry
out
these
instructions
jackson
had
at
his
disposal
infantry
cavalry
and
six
batteries
of
guns
fortunately
they
were
all
virginians
with
the
exception
of
one
battalion
the
first
which
was
composed
of
irish
navvies
this
force
which
had
now
received
the
title
of
the
army
of
the
valley
was
organised
in
three

the
infantry
were
by
this
time
fairly
well
armed
and
equipped
but
the
were
mostly
smoothbores
of
small
calibre
of
the
quality
of
the
troops
bull
run
had
been
sufficient
test
side
by
side
with
the
sons
of
the
old
virginia
houses
the
hunters
and
yeomen
of
the
valley
had
proved
their
worth
their
skill
as
marksmen
had
stood
them
in
good
stead
men
who
had
been
used
from
boyhood
to
shoot
squirrels
in
the
woodland
found
the
federal
soldier
a
target
difficult
to
miss
skirmishing
and
patrolling
came
instinctively
to
those
who
had
stalked
the
deer
and
the
bear
in
the
mountain
forests
and
the
simple
hardy
life
of
an
agricultural
community
was
the
best
probation
for
the
trials
of
a
campaign
the
lack
of
discipline
and
of
competent
regimental
officers
might
have
placed
them
at
a
disadvantage
had
they
been
opposed
to
regulars
but
they
were
already
to
the
soldier
trade
before
they
joined
the
ranks
they
were
no
strangers
to
camp
and
bivouac
to
peril
and
adventure
their
hands
could
guard
their
heads
quick
sight
and
steady
nerve
unfailing
vigilance
and
instant
resolve
the
very
qualities
which
their
devotion
to
fostered
were
those
which
had
so
often
prevailed
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
over
the
mechanical
tactics
of
battalions
and
on
ground
with
which
they
were
perfectly
familiar
the
men
of
the
shenandoah
were
formidable
indeed
they
were
essentially
rough
and
ready
their
appearance
would
hardly
have
captivated
a
martinet
the
eye
that
lingers
lovingly
on
glittering
buttons
and
spotless
belts
would
have
turned
away
in
disdain
from
jackson
soldiers
there
was
nothing
bright
about
them
but
their
rifles
they
were
as
badly
dressed
and
with
as
little
regard
for
uniformity
as
the
defenders
of
torres
vedras
or
the
army
of
italy
in
like
wellington
and
napoleon
the
confederate
generals
cared
very
little
what
their
soldiers
wore
so
long
as
they
did
their
duty
least
of
all
can
one
imagine
stonewall
jackson
exercising
his
mind
as
to
the
cut
of
a
tunic
or
the
polish
of
a
buckle
the
only
standing
order
in
the
english
army
of
the
peninsula
which
referred
to
dress
forbade
the
wearing
of
the
enemy
uniform
it
was
the
same
in
the
army
of
the
valley
although
at
a
later
period
even
this
order
was
of
necessity
ignored
as
their
forefathers
of
the
revolution
took
post
in
washington
ranks
clad
in
hunting
shirts
and
leggings
so
the
confederate
soldiers
preferred
the
garments
spun
by
their
own
women
to
those
supplied
them
by
the
state
grey
of
all
shades
from
light
blue
to
was
the
universal
colour
the
coatee
issued
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
had
already
given
place
to
a
and
jacket
the
blue
kepi
held
out
longer
the
soft
felt
hat
which
experience
soon
proved
the
most
serviceable
had
not
yet
become
universal
but
the
long
boots
had
gone
and
strong
brogans
with
broad
soles
and
low
heels
had
been
found
more
comfortable
overcoats
were
soon
discarded
the
men
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trouble
of
carrying
them
on
hot
days
outweighed
their
comfort
when
the
cold
day
arrived
besides
they
found
that
life
in
the
open
air
hardened
them
to
such
an
extent
that
changes
in
temperature
were
hardly
felt
soldier
life
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
chapter
nor
did
the
knapsack
long
survive
it
was
found
to
gall
the
back
and
shoulders
and
weary
the
man
before
half
the
march
was
accomplished
it
did
not
pay
to
carry
around
clean
clothes
while
waiting
for
the
time
to
use
them
ibid
but
the
men
still
clung
to
their
blankets
and
waterproof
sheets
worn
in
a
roll
over
the
left
shoulder
and
the
indispensable
haversack
carried
their
whole
kit
tents
except
the
enemy
were
rarely
seen
the
army
of
the
valley
generally
bivouacked
in
the
woods
the
men
sleeping
in
pairs
rolled
in
their
blankets
and
rubber
sheets
the
cooking
arrangements
were
primitive
a
few
and
skillets
formed
the
culinary
apparatus
of
a
company
with
a
bucket
or
two
in
addition
and
the
were
generally
carried

was
a
ornament
and
if
as
was
sometimes
the
case
three
rations
were
served
out
at
a
single
issue
the
men
usually
cooked
and
ate
them
at
once
so
as
to
avoid
the
labour
of
carrying
them
such
was
jackson
infantry
a
sorry
contrast
indeed
to
the
soldierly
array
of
the
federals
with
their
complete
appointments
and
trim
blue
uniforms
but
fine
feathers
though
they
may
have
their
use
are
hardly
essential
to
efficiency
in
the
field
and
whilst
it
is
absolutely
true
that
no
soldiers
ever
marched
with
less
to
encumber
them
than
the
confederates
it
is
no
empty
boast
that
none
ever
marched
faster
or
held
out
longer
if
the
artillery
with
a
most
inferior
equipment
was
less
efficient
than
the
infantry
the
cavalry
was
an
invaluable
auxiliary
ashby
was
the
of
a
captain
of
his
reckless
daring
both
and
under
fire
made
him
the
idol
of
the
army
nor
was
his
reputation
confined
to
the
confederate
ranks
i
think
even
our
men
says
a
federal
officer
had
a
kind
of
admiration
for
him
as
he
sat
unmoved
upon
his
horse
and
let
them
pepper
away
at
him
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
his
one
shortcoming
was
his
ignorance
of
drill
and
discipline
but
in
the
spring
of
these
deficiencies
were
in
a
fair
way
of
being
rectified
he
had
already
learned
something
of
tactics
in
command
of
a
few
hundred
mounted
riflemen
and
a
section
of
he
was
unsurpassed
and
if
his
men
were
apt
to
get
out
of
hand
in
battle
his
personal
activity
ensured
their
strict
attention
on
the
outposts
he
thought
little
of
riding
seventy
or
eighty
miles
within
the
day
along
his
picket
line
and
it
is
said
that
he
first
recommended
himself
to
jackson
by
visiting
the
federal
camps
disguised
as
a
horse
doctor
jackson
placed
much
dependence
on
his
mounted
troops
immediately
he
arrived
in
the
valley
he
established
his
cavalry
outposts
far
to
the
front
while
the
infantry
were
reposing
in
their
camps
near
winchester
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
forty
miles
northward
was
closely
and
incessantly
patrolled
the
squadrons
never
lacked
recruits
with
the
virginians
the
cavalry
was
the
favourite
arm
and
the
strength
of
the
regiments
was
only
limited
by
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
horses
to
the
sons
of
the
valley
planters
and
farmers
ashby
ranks
offered
a
most
attractive
career
the
discipline
was
easy
and
there
was
no
time
for
drill
but
of
excitement
and
adventure
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
scarcely
a
day
passed
without
shots
being
exchanged
at
one
point
or
another
of
the
picket
line
there
were
the
enemy
outposts
to
be
harassed
prisoners
to
be
taken
bridges
to
be
burnt
and
convoys
to
be
captured
many
were
the
opportunities
for
distinction
jackson
demanded
something
more
from
his
cavalry
than
merely
guarding
the
frontier
it
was
not
sufficient
for
him
to
receive
warning
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
he
wanted
information
from
which
he
could
deduce
what
he
intended
doing
information
of
the
strength
of
his
garrisons
of
the
dispositions
of
his
camps
of
every
movement
which
took
place
beyond
the
river
the
cavalry
had
other
and
more
dangerous
duties
than
vedette
and
escort
to
penetrate
the
enemy
lines
to
approach
his
camps
and
observe
his
columns
these
were
the
tasks
of
ashby
riders
and
in
these
they
were
unrivalled
many
of
them
were
no
more
than
boys
but
their
qualifications
for
such
a
life
were
undeniable
a
more
gallant
or
body
of
young
soldiers
never
welcomed
the
boot
and
saddle
their
horses
were
their
own
scions
of
good
virginian
stock
with
the
blood
of
many
a
sire
eclipse
brighteyes
and
timoleon
in
their
veins
and
they
knew
how
to
care
for
them
they
were
acquainted
with
every
country
lane
and
woodland
track
they
had
friends
in
every
village
and
their
names
were
known
to
every
farmer
the
night
was
no
hindrance
to
them
even
in
the
region
of
the
mountain
and
the
forest
the
hunter
paths
were
as
familiar
to
them
as
the
turnpike
roads
they
knew
the
depth
and
direction
of
every
ford
and
could
predict
the
effect
of
the
weather
on
stream
and
track
more
admirable
material
for
the
service
of
intelligence
could
not
possibly
have
been
found
and
audacity
in
reconnaissance
found
ready
imitators
a
generous
rivalry
in
deeds
of
daring
spread
through
the
command
bold
enterprises
were
succeeded
by
others
yet
more
bold
and
to
use
the
words
of
a
gentleman
who
although
he
was
a
veteran
of
four
years
service
was
but
nineteen
years
of
age
when
richmond
fell
we
thought
no
more
of
riding
through
the
enemy
bivouacs
than
of
riding
round
our
farms
so
congenial
were
the
duties
of
the
cavalry
so
attractive
the
life
and
the
associations
that
it
was
no
rare
thing
for
a
virginia
gentleman
to
resign
a
commission
in
another
arm
in
order
to
join
his
friends
and
kinsmen
as
a
private
in
ashby
ranks
and
so
before
the
war
had
been
in
progress
for
many
months
the
fame
of
the
virginia
cavalry
rivalled
that
of
their
revolutionary
forbears
under
harry
the
friend
of
washington
and
the
father
of
lee
but
if
the
raw
material
of
jackson
army
was
all
that
could
be
desired
no
less
so
was
the
material
of
the
force
opposed
to
him
the
regiments
of
banks
army
corps
were
recruited
as
a
rule
in
the
western
states
ohio
indiana
and
west
virginia
furnished
the
majority
they
too
were
hunters
and
farmers
accustomed
to
firearms
and
skilled
in
woodcraft
no
hardier
infantry
marched
beneath
the
stars
and
stripes
the
artillery
armed
with
a
proportion
of
rifled
guns
was
more
efficient
than
that
of
the
confederates
and
in
cavalry
alone
were
the
federals
overmatched
in
numbers
the
latter
were
far
superior
to
ashby
squadrons
in
everything
else
they
were
immeasurably
inferior
throughout
the
north
horsemanship
was
practically
an
unknown
art
the
gentlemen
of
new
england
had
not
inherited
the
love
of
their
ironside
ancestors
for
the
saddle
and
the
chase
even
in
the
forests
of
the
west
men
travelled
by
waggon
and
hunted
on
foot
as
cavalry
says
one
of
banks
brigadiers
men
were
greatly
superior
to
ours
in

to
some
orders

had

gordon
page
it
was
easy
enough
to
fill
the
ranks
of
the
northern
squadrons
men
volunteered
freely
for
what
they
deemed
the
more
dashing
branch
of
the
service
ignorant
that
its
duties
were
far
harder
both
to
learn
and
to
execute
than
those
of
the
other
arms
and
expecting
says
a
federal
officer
that
the
regiment
would
be
accompanied
by
an
itinerant
livery
stable
both
horses
and
men
were
recruited
without
the
slightest
reference
to
their
fitness
for
cavalry
work
no
man
was
rejected
no
matter
what
his
size
or
weight
no
matter
whether
he
had
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
horseflesh
or
not
and
consequently
the
proportion
of
sick
horses
was
enormous
moreover
while
the
southern
troopers
generally
carried
a
firearm
either
rifle
or
some
of
the
northern
squadrons
had
only
the
sabre
and
in
a
wooded
country
the
firearm
was
master
of
the
situation
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
therefore
the
federal
cavalry
generally
speaking
were
bad
riders
and
worse
unable
to
move
except
upon
the
roads
and
as
inefficient
on
reconnaissance
as
in
action
for
an
invading
army
information
ample
and
accurate
is
the
first
requisite
operating
in
a
country
which
almost
invariably
must
be
better
known
to
the
defenders
bold
scouting
alone
will
secure
it
from
ambush
and
surprise
bold
scouting
was
impossible
with
such
mounted
troops
as
banks
possessed
and
throughout
the
valley
campaign
the
northern
general
was
simply
groping
in
the
dark
but
even
had
his
cavalry
been
more
efficient
it
is
doubtful
whether
banks
would
have
profited
his
appointment
was
political
he
was
an
ardent
abolitionist
but
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
soldiering
he
had
begun
life
as
a
hand
in
a
cotton
factory
by
dint
of
energy
and
good
brains
his
rise
had
been
rapid
and
although
when
the
war
broke
out
he
was
still
a
young
man
he
had
been
governor
of
massachusetts
and
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
what
the
president
expected
when
he
gave
him
an
army
corps
it
is
difficult
to
divine
what
might
have
been
expected
any
soldier
could
have
told
him
to
gratify
an
individual
or
perhaps
to
conciliate
a
political
faction
the
life
of
many
a
private
soldier
was
sacrificed
lincoln
it
is
true
was
by
no
means
solitary
in
the
unwisdom
of
his
selections
for
command
his
rival
in
richmond
it
is
said
had
a
fatal
penchant
for
his
first
wife
relations
his
political
supporters
were
constantly
rewarded
by
appointments
in
the
field
and
the
worst
disasters
that
befell
the
confederacy
were
due
in
great
part
to
the
blunders
of
officers
promoted
for
any
other
reason
than
efficiency
for
davis
there
was
little
excuse
he
had
been
educated
at
west
point
he
had
served
in
the
regular
army
of
the
united
states
and
had
been
secretary
of
war
at
washington
lincoln
on
the
other
hand
knew
nothing
of
war
beyond
what
he
had
learned
in
a
border
skirmish
and
very
little
of
general
history
he
had
not
yet
got
rid
of
the
common
idea
that
a
man
who
has
pluck
and
muscle
is
already
a
good
soldier
and
that
the
same
qualities
which
serve
in
a
are
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
a
general
nor
were
historical
precedents
wanting
for
the
mistakes
of
the
american
statesmen
in
both
the
peninsula
and
the
crimea
lives
treasure
and
prestige
were
as
recklessly
wasted
as
in
virginia
and
staff
officers
who
owed
their
positions
to
social
influence
alone
generals
useless
and
ignorant
who
succeeded
to
responsible
command
by
virtue
of
seniority
and
a
long
purse
were
the
standing
curse
of
the
english
army
at
the
same
time
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
some
of
the
regular
officers
would
have
done
better
than
banks
he
was
no
fool
and
if
he
had
not
studied
the
art
of
war
there
have
been
generals
who
have
showed
as
much
ignorance
without
his
ability
natural
commonsense
has
often
a
better
chance
of
success
than
a
rusty
brain
and
a
mind
narrowed
by
routine
after
serving
in
twenty
campaigns
frederick
the

were
still
mules
on
this
very
theatre
of
war
in
the
forests
beyond
romney
an
english
general
had
led
a
detachment
of
english
soldiers
to
a
defeat
as
crushing
as
it
was
disgraceful
and
braddock
was
a
veteran
of
many
wars
here
too
patterson

officer
of
volunteers
who
had
seen
much
service
had
allowed
johnston
to
slip
away
and
join
beauregard
on
bull
run
the
northern
people
in
good
truth
had
as
yet
no
reason
to
place
implicit
confidence
in
the
leading
of
trained
soldiers
they
had
yet
to
learn
that
mere
length
of
service
is
no
test
whatever
of
capacity
for
command
and
that
character
fortified
by
knowledge
is
the
only
charm
which
attracts
success
jackson
had
already
some
acquaintance
with
banks
during
the
romney
expedition
the
latter
had
been
posted
at
frederick
with
men
and
a
more
enterprising
commander
would
at
least
have
endeavoured
to
thwart
the
confederate
movements
banks
supine
in
his
camps
made
neither
threat
nor
demonstration
throughout
the
winter
troopers
had
ridden
unmolested
along

worried

confederate
outposts

advanced
detachments

banks
had
been
and

jackson

not
failed
to
note
his
characteristics

the

had

on

the

the

and
the

from

reduce
him
to
about
that
number
manuscript
his
men
had
remained
under
arms
all
day
in
the
hope
that
the
enemy
advanced
guard
might
be
tempted
to
attack
but
the
activity
of
ashby
cavalry
and
the
boldness
with
which
jackson
maintained
his
position
impressed
his
adversary
with
the
conviction
that
the
confederate
force
was
much
greater
than
it
really
was
it
was
reported
in
the
federal
camps
that
the
enemy
strength
was
from
to
men
and
that
the
town
was
fortified
jackson
force
did
not
amount
to
half
that
number
and
according
to
a
northern
officer
one
could
have
jumped
over
his
intrenchments
as
easily
as
remus
over
the
walls
of
rome
jackson
abandoned
winchester
with
extreme
reluctance
besides
being
the
principal
town
in
that
section
of
the
valley
it
was
strategically
important
to
the
enemy
good
roads
led
in
every
direction
and
communication
was
easy
with
romney
and
cumberland
to
the
and
with
washington
and
manassas
to
the
placed
at
winchester
banks
could
support
or
be
supported
by
the
troops
in
west
virginia
or
the
army
south
of
washington
a
large
and
fertile
district
would
thus
be
severed
from
the
confederacy
and
the
line
of
invasion
across
the
upper
potomac
completely
blocked
overwhelming
as
was
the
strength
of
the
union
force
exceeding
his
own
by
more
than
eight
to
one
great
as
was
the
caution
of
the
federal
leader
it
was
only
an
unlucky
accident
that
restrained
jackson
from
a
resolute
endeavour
to
at
least
postpone
the
capture
of
the
town
he
had
failed
to
induce
the
enemy
advanced
guard
to
attack
him
in
position
to
attack
himself
in
broad
daylight
with
such
vast
disproportion
of
numbers
was
out
of
the
question
his
resources
however
were
not
exhausted
after
dark
on
the
when
his
troops
had
left
the
town
he
called
a
council
consisting
of
general
garnett
and
the
regimental
commanders
of
the
stonewall
brigade
and
proposed
a
night
attack
on
the
federal
advance
when
the
troops
had
eaten
their
supper
and
rested
for
some
hours
they
were
to
march
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
enemy
some
four
miles
north
of
winchester
and
make
the
attack
before
daylight
the
federal
troops
were
raw
and
inexperienced
prestige
was
on
the
side
of
the
confederates
and
their
morale
was
high
the
darkness
the
suddenness
and
energy
of
the
attack
the
lack
of
drill
and
discipline
would
all
tend
to
throw
the
enemy
into
confusion
and
by
the
vigorous
use
of
the
bayonet
and
the
blessing
of
divine
providence
jackson
believed
that
he
would
win
a
signal
victory
in
the
meantime
whilst
the
council
was
assembling
he
went
off
booted
and
spurred
to
make
a
hasty
call
on
graham
whose
family
he
found
oppressed
with
the
gloom
that
overspread
the
whole
town
he
was
so
buoyant
and
hopeful
himself
that
their
drooping
spirits
were
revived
and
after
engaging
with
them
in
family
worship
he
retired
departing
with
a
cheerful
good
evening
merely
saying
that
he
intended
to
dine
with
them
the
next
day
as
usual
when
the
council
met
however
it
was
found
that
someone
had
blundered
the
staff
had
been
at
fault
the
general
had
ordered
his
trains
to
be
parked
immediately
south
of
winchester
but
they
had
been
taken
by
those
in
charge
to
kernstown
and
newtown
from
three
to
eight
miles
distant
and
the
troops
had
been
marched
back
to
them
to
get
their
rations
jackson
learned
for
the
first
time
when
he
met
his
officers
that
his
brigades
instead
of
being
on
the
outskirts
of
winchester
were
already
five
or
six
miles
away
a
march
of
ten
miles
would
thus
be
needed
to
bring
them
into
contact
with
the
enemy
this
fact
and
the
disapproval
of
the
council
caused
him
to
abandon
his
project
before
following
his
troops
he
once
more
went
back
to
graham
his
cheerful
demeanour
during
his
previous
visit
although
he
had
been
as
reticent
as
ever
as
to
his
plans
had
produced
a
false
impression
and
this
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
correct
he
explained
his
plans
to
his
friend
and
as
he
detailed
the
facts
which
had
induced
him
to
change
them
he
repeatedly
expressed
his
reluctance
to
give
up
winchester
without
a
blow
with
slow
and
desperate
earnestness
he
said
me
think
can
i
not
yet
carry
my
plan
into
execution
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
grasped
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
the
fierce
light
that
blazed
in
his
eyes
revealed
to
his
companion
a
new
man
the
next
moment
he
dropped
his
head
and
released
his
sword
with
the
words
no
i
must
not
do
it
it
may
cost
the
lives
of
too
many
brave
men
i
must
retreat
and
wait
for
a
better
time
he
had
learned
a
lesson
late
in
the
evening
says
the
medical
director
of
the
valley
army
we
withdrew
from
winchester
i
rode
with
the
general
as
we
left
the
place
and
as
we
reached
a
high
point
overlooking
the
town
we
both
turned
to
look
at
winchester
now
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
federal
soldiers
i
think
that
a
man
may
sometimes
yield
to
overwhelming
emotion
and
i
was
utterly
overcome
by
the
fact
that
i
was
leaving
all
that
i
held
dear
on
earth
but
my
emotion
was
arrested
by
one
look
at
jackson
his
face
was
fairly
blazing
with
the
fire
of
wrath
that
was
burning
in
him
and
i
felt
awed
before
him
presently
he
cried
out
in
a
tone
almost
savage
is
the
last
council
of
war
i
will
ever
hold
on
leaving
winchester
jackson
fell
back
to
strasburg
eighteen
miles
south
there
was
no
immediate
pursuit
march
banks
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
occupied
the
town
and
awaited
further
orders
these
came
on
the
volume
part
page
and
shields
division
of
men
with
guns
was
at
once
pushed
on
to
strasburg
jackson
had
already
withdrawn
hoping
to
draw
banks
up
the
valley
and
was
now
encamped
near
mount
jackson
a
strong
position
miles
further
south
the
indefatigable
ashby
still
skirmishing
with
the
enemy
the
unusual
audacity
which
prompted
the
federal
advance
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
exact
strength
of
the
confederate
force
had
been
ascertained
in
winchester
at
all
events
all
apprehension
of
attack
had
vanished
jackson
men
were
considered
a
quantite
negligeable
a
mere
corps
of
observation
and
not
only

but
a
large
portion
of
banks
corps
was
ordered
to
another
field
its
role
as
an
independent
force
had
ceased
its
movements
were
henceforward
to
be
subordinate
to
those
of
the
main
army
and
mcclellan
designed
to
bring
it
into
closer
connection
with
his
advance
on
richmond

his
design
was
frustrated
how
he
struggled
in
vain
to
correct
the
original
dissemination
of
his
forces
how
his
right
wing
was
held
in
a
vice
by
jackson
and
how
his
initial
errors
eventually
ruined
his
campaign
is
a
strategical
lesson
of
the
highest
import
from
the
day
mcclellan
took
command
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
done
practically
nothing
throughout
the
winter
troops
had
poured
into
washington
at
the
rate
of
a
month
at
the
end
of
december
there
were
men
fit
for
duty
on
march
the
grand
aggregate
was
volume
part
page
but
during
the
winter
no
important
enterprise
had
been
undertaken
the
colours
of
the
rebels
were
still
flaunting
within
sight
of
the
forts
of
washington
and
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
was
securely
closed
by
confederate
batteries
with
a
mighty
army
at
their
service
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
north
became
restive
and
reproached
their
general
it
is
doubtless
true
that
the
first
thing
needful
was
organisation
to
discipline
and
consolidate
the
army
so
as
to
make
success
assured
was
unquestionably
the
wiser
policy
the
impatience
of
a
sovereign
people
ignorant
of
war
is
not
to
be
lightly
yielded
to
at
the
same
time
the
desire
of
a
nation
can
not
be
altogether
disregarded
a
general
who
obstinately
refuses
to
place
himself
in
accord
with
the
political
situation
forfeits
the
confidence
of
his
employers
and
the
cordial
support
of
the
administration
the
cry
throughout
the
north
was
for
action
the
president
took
it
upon
himself
to
issue
a
series
of
orders
the
army
was
ordered
to
advance
on
february
a
date
chosen
because
it
was
washington
birthday
just
as
the
third
and
most
disastrous
assault
on
plevna
was
delivered
on
the
of
the
czar
mcclellan
secured
delay
his
plans
were
not
yet
ripe
the
virginia
roads
were
still
impassable
the
season
was
not
yet
sufficiently
advanced
for
active
operations
and
that
his
objections
were
well
founded
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
prospect
of
success
depended
much
upon
the
weather
virginia
covered
in
many
places
with
dense
forests
crossed
by
many
rivers
and
with
most
indifferent
communications
is
a
most
difficult
theatre
of
war
and
the
amenities
of
the
virginian
spring
are
not
to
be
lightly
faced
napoleon
fifth
element
mud
is
a
most
disturbing
factor
in
military
calculations
it
is
related
that
a
federal
officer
sent
out
to
reconnoitre
a
road
in
a
certain
district
of
virginia
reported
that
the
road
was
there
but
that
he
guessed
the
bottom
had
fallen
out
moreover
mcclellan
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
confederate
army
at
manassas
was
more
than
double
its
actual
strength
his
intelligence
department
controlled
not
by
a
trained
staff
officer
but
by
a
detective
estimated
johnston
force
at
men
in
reality
including
the
detachment
on
the
shenandoah
it
at
no
time
exceeded
but
for
all
this
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
absolute
inactivity
the
capture
of
the
batteries
which
barred
the
entrance
to
the
potomac
the
defeat
of
the
confederate
detachments
along
the
river
the
occupation
of
winchester
or
of
leesburg
were
all
feasible
operations
by
such
means
the
impatience
of
the
northern
people
might
have
been
assuaged
a
few
successes
even
on
a
small
scale
would
have
raised
the
morale
of
the
troops
and
have
trained
them
to
offensive
movements
the
general
would
have
retained
the
confidence
of
the
administration
and
have
secured
the
respect
of
his
opponents
jackson
had
set
him
the
example
his
winter
expeditions
had
borne
fruit
the
federal
generals
opposed
to
him
gave
him
full
credit
for
activity
much
dissatisfaction
was
expressed
by
the
troops
says
one
of
banks
brigadiers
that
jackson
was
permitted
to
get
away
from
winchester
without
a
fight
and
but
little
heed
was
paid
to
my
assurances
that
this
chieftain
would
be
apt
before
the
war
closed
to
give
us
an
entertainment
up
to
the
utmost
of
our
aspirations
general
gordon
it
was
not
only
of
mcclellan
inactivity
that
the
government
complained
at
the
end
of
february
he
submitted
a
plan
of
operations
to
the
president
and
with
that
plan
lincoln
totally
disagreed
mcclellan
basing
his
project
on
the
supposition
that
johnston
had
men
behind
formidable
intrenchments
at
manassas
blocking
the
road
to
richmond
proposed
to
transfer
men
to
the
virginia
coast
by
sea
and
landing
either
at
urbanna
on
the
rappahannock
or
at
fortress
monroe
on
the
yorktown
peninsula
to
intervene
between
the
confederate
army
and
richmond
and
possibly
to
capture
the
southern
capital
before
johnston
could
get
back
to
save
it
the
plan
at
first
sight
seemed
promising
but
in
lincoln
eyes
it
had
this
great
defect
during
the
time
mcclellan
was
moving
round
by
water
and
disembarking
his
troops
and
this
so
few
were
the
transports
would
take
at
least
a
month
johnston
might
make
a
dash
at
washington
the
city
had
been
fortified
a
cordon
of
detached
forts
surrounded
it
on
a
circumference
of
thirty
miles
the
potomac
formed
an
additional
protection
but
a
cordon
of
isolated
earthworks
does
not
appeal
as
an
effective
barrier
to
the
civilian
mind
and
above
point
of
rocks
the
great
river
was
easy
of
passage
even
if
washington
were
absolutely
safe
from
a
coup
de
main
lincoln
had
still
good
reason
for
apprehension
the
union
capital
was
merely
the
seat
of
government
it
had
no
commercial
interests
with
a
population
of
but
it
was
of
no
more
practical
importance
than
windsor
or
versailles
compared
with
new
york
pittsburg
or
philadelphia
it
was
little
more
than
a
village
but
in
the
regard
of
the
northern
people
washington
was
the
centre
of
the
union
the
keystone
of
the
national
existence
the
capitol
the
white
house
the
treasury
were
symbols
as
sacred
to
the
states
as
the
colours
to
a
regiment

an
interesting

the
views
of
the
soldiers

washington

volume

if
the
nation
was
set
upon
the
fall
of
richmond
it
was
at
least
as
solicitous
for
the
security
of
its
own
chief
city
and
an
administration
that
permitted
that
security
to
be
endangered
would
have
been
compelled
to
bow
to
the
popular
clamour
the
extraordinary
taxation
demanded
by
the
war
already
pressed
heavily
on
the
people
stocks
were
falling
rapidly
and
the
financial
situation
was
almost
critical
it
is
probable
too
that
a
blow
at
washington
would
have
done
more
than
destroy
all
confidence
in
the
government
england
and
france
were
chafing
under
the
effects
of
the
blockade
the
marts
of
europe
were
hungry
for
cotton
there
was
much
sympathy
beyond
seas
with
the
seceded
states
and
should
washington
fall
the
south
in
all
likelihood
would
be
recognised
as
an
independent
nation
even
if
the
great
powers
were
to
refuse
her
active
aid
in
the
shape
of
fleets
and
armies
she
would
at
least
have
access
to
the
money
markets
of
the
world
and
it
was
possible
that
neither
england
nor
france
would
endure
the
closing
of
her
ports
with
the
breaking
of
the
blockade
money
munitions
and
perhaps
recruits
would
be
poured
into
the
confederacy
and
the
difficulty
of
reconquest
would
be
trebled
the
dread
of
foreign
interference
was
therefore
very
real
and
lincoln
foreseeing
the
panic
that
would
shake
the
nation
should
a
confederate
army
cross
the
potomac
at
harper
ferry
or
point
of
rocks
was
quite
justified
in
insisting
on
the
security
of
washington
being
placed
beyond
a
doubt
he
knew
as
also
did
jackson
that
even
a
mere
demonstration
against
so
vital
a
point
might
have
the
most
deplorable
effect
whatever
line
of
invasion
he
asked
might
be
adopted
let
it
be
one
that
would
cover
washington
lincoln
remonstrances
however
had
no
great
weight
with
mcclellan
the
general
paid
little
heed
to
the
political
situation
his
chief
argument
in
favour
of
the
expedition
by
sea
had
been
the
strength
of
the
fortifications
at
manassas
johnston
retreat
on
march
removed
this
obstacle
from
his
path
but
although
he
immediately
marched
his
whole
army
in
pursuit
he
still
remained
constant
to
his
favourite
idea
the
road
to
richmond
from
washington
involved
a
march
of
one
hundred
miles
over
a
difficult
country
with
a
single
railway
as
the
line
of
supply
the
route
from
the
coast
although
little
shorter
was
certainly
easier
fortress
monroe
had
remained
in
federal
hands
landing
under
the
shelter
of
its
guns
he
would
push
forward
aided
by
the
navy
to
west
point

terminus
of
the
york
river
railroad
within
thirty
miles
of
richmond
transporting
his
supplies
by
water
washington
with
the
garrison
he
would
leave
behind
would
in
his
opinion
be
quite
secure
the
confederates
would
be
compelled
to
concentrate
for
the
defence
of
their
capital
and
a
resolute
endeavour
on
their
part
to
cross
the
potomac
was
forbidden
by
every
rule
of
strategy
had
not
johnston
in
his
retreat
burnt
the
railway
bridges
could
there
be
a
surer
indication
that
he
had
no
intention
of
returning
such
was
mcclellan
reasoning
and
putting
politics
aside
it
was
perfectly
sound
lincoln
reluctantly
yielded
and
on

the
army
of
the
potomac

by
successive
divisions

centreville

its

posted
the

of

eastward
of

a
strong
force
of
infantry
with
waving
colours
was
plainly
visible
to
the
confederates

it
was
seen
that
the
extreme

was
protected
by
several
guns
on
the

of
the

was
a
line
of
skirmishers
deployed
along
the
base
of

and
on

knoll
itself
stood
two
batteries
the
wooded
ridge
to
westward
was
as
yet
unoccupied
except
by
scouting
parties
jackson
at
once
determined
to
turn
the
enemy
right
an
attack
upon
the
federal
left
would
have
to
be
pushed
across
the
open
fields
and
decided
by
fair
fighting
gun
and
rifle
against
gun
and
rifle
and
on
that
flank
the
enemy
was
prepared
for
battle
could
he
seize
the
wooded
ridge
on
his
left
the
initiative
would
be
his
his
opponent
would
be
compelled
to
conform
to
his
movements
the
advantages
of
a
carefully
selected
position
would
be
lost
instead
of
receiving
attack
where
he
stood
the
federal
general
would
have
to
change
front
to
meet
it
to
execute
movements
which
he
had
possibly
not
foreseen
to
fight
on
ground
with
which
he
was
unfamiliar
and
instead
of
carrying
out
a
plan
which
had
been
previously
thought
out
to
conceive
a
new
one
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
to
issue
immediate
orders
for
a
difficult
operation
hesitation
and
confusion
might
ensue
and
in

of
a
strongly
established
line
confidently
awaiting
the
advance
isolated
regiments
in
all
the
haste
and
excitement
of
rapid
movement
or
hurriedly
posted
in
unfavourable
positions
would
probably
oppose
the
confederate
onset
such
are
the
advantages
which
accrue
to
the
force
which
delivers
an
attack
where
it
is
not
expected

to
all
appearance
jackson
plan
of
battle
promised
to
bring
them
into
play
to
the
very
fullest
extent
the
whole
force
of

reported
by
ashby
was
before
him
plainly
visible
to
seize
the

held
the
federals
fast
in
front
to
pass
beyond
pritchard
hill
and
to
cut
the
line
of
retreat
on
winchester
seemed
no
difficult
task
the
only
danger
was
the
possibility
of
a
counterstroke
while
the
confederates
were
executing
their
turning
movement
but
the
enemy
so
far
as
jackson
information
went
was
rapidly
withdrawing
from

no

extreme

mere

in

northward
of

a

his

under

when
the

broke
out
on
his

they
were
moving
forward
over
an
open
field
across
the

ran
a
stone
wall

beyond

were
seen
the
tossing
colours
and
bright
bayonets
of
a
line
of
battle
just
emerging
from
the
woods
then
came
a
race
for

and
the
confederates
won
a
heavy
fire
at
the
closest
range
blazed
out
in
the
face
of

in

easily
frustrated

maintained

held
stubbornly

of

everywhere
to

but
he
looked
further

justified
in
saying

wrote
in

yet
the
most
essential
fruits
of

would
be
to
assert
too
much
that
he
realised
that
the
battle
though
a
tactical
defeat
was
strategically
a
victory
is
very
evident
he
knew
something
of
banks
he
knew
more
of
mcclellan
and
the
bearing
of
the
valley
on
the
defence
of
washington
had
long
been
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
had
learned
from
napoleon
to
throw
himself
into
the
spirit
of
his
enemy
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
when
he
stood
before
the
fire
near

he
had
already
foreseen
in
some
degree
at

the
events
that
would

to

decreased

remain

in
place
of
embarking
for
the
peninsula

the

on

found
his

reduced
by
officers
and

not
content

the
confederates
had
now
to
deal
with
four
distinct
armies

fremont
dependent
for
on
the

of

president
lincoln

his

this
was
not
all
mcdowell
had
been
assigned
a
most
important
part
in
mcclellan
plan
of
invasion
the
road
from
fortress
monroe
was
barred
by
the
fortifications
of

these
works
could
be
turned
however
by
sending
a
force
up
the
york
river
but
the
passage
of
the
stream
was
debarred
to
the
federal
transports
by
a
strong
fort
at
gloucester
point
on
the
left
bank
and
the
capture
of
this
work
was
to
be
the
task
of
the
first
army
corps
no
wonder
that
mcclellan
believing
that
johnston
commanded
men
declared
that
in
his
deliberate
judgment
the
success
of
the
federal
cause
was
imperilled
by
the
order
which
detached
mcdowell
from
his
command
however
inadequately
the
capital
might
be
defended
it
was
worse
than
folly
to
interfere
with
the
general
plans
when
he
was
on
the
eve
of
executing
them
the
best
way
of
defending
washington
was
for
mcclellan
to
march
rapidly
on
richmond
and
seize
his
adversary
by
the
throat
by
depriving
him
of
mcdowell
lincoln
and
his
advisers
made
such
a
movement
difficult
and
the
grand
army
of
invasion
found
itself
in
a
most
embarrassing
situation
such
was
the
effect
of
a
blow
struck
at
the
right
place
and
the
right
time
though
struck
by
no
more
than
bayonets
the
battle
of
kernstown
was
undoubtedly
well
fought
it
is
true
that
jackson
believed
that
he
had
no
more
than
four
regiments
of
infantry
a
few
batteries
and
some
cavalry
before
him
but
it
was
a
skilful
manoeuvre
which
threw
three
brigades
and
three
batteries
more
than
of
his
whole
strength
on
his
opponent
flank
an
ordinary
general
would
probably
have
employed
only
a
small
portion
of
his
force
in
the
turning
movement
not
so
the
student
of
napoleon
in
the
general
haversack
says
one
of
jackson
staff
were
always
three
books
the
bible
napoleon
maxims
of
war
and
webster
dictionary
for
his
spelling
was
uncertain
and
these
books
he
constantly
consulted
whether
the
chronicles
of
the
jewish
kings
threw
any
light
on
the
tactical
problem
involved
at
kernstown
may
be
left
to
the
commentators
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
maxims
to
hurl
overwhelming
numbers
at
the
point
where
the
enemy
least
expects
attack
is
the
whole
burden
of
napoleon
teaching
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
wooded
ridge
unoccupied
save
by
a
few
scouts
was
the
weakest
point
of
the
defence
the
manoeuvre
certainly
surprised
the

it
very
nearly
beat

tyler

unsupported

an
hour

a
half

have
been
too
late
to
save
the
day
coming
up
as
they
did
not
in
a
mass
so
strong
as
to
bear
all
before
it
by
its
own
inherent
weight

in
successive
battalions
at
wide
intervals
of
time
they
would
themselves
have
become
involved
in
a
desperate
engagement

adverse
circumstances

is
kimball
to
be
blamed
that
he
did
not
throw
greater
weight
on
jackson
turning
column
at
an
earlier
hour
like
shields
and
banks
he
was
unable
to
believe
that
jackson
was
unsupported
he
expected
that
the
flank
attack
would
be
followed
up
by
one
in
superior
numbers
from
the
front
he
could
hardly
credit
that
an
inferior
force
would
deliberately
move
off
to
a
flank
leaving
its
line
of
retreat
to
be
guarded
by
a
few
squadrons
weakly
supported
by
infantry

the
audacity
of
the
assailant
had
the
usual
effect
of
deceiving
the
defender
kernstown
moreover
will
rank
as
an
example
of
what
determined
men
can
do
against
superior
numbers
the
confederates
on
the
ridge
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
fight
hardly
exceeded
muskets
they
were
assailed
by

proved
a
match
for
them
the
were
then
reinforced
by
at
least
more
whilst
jackson
could
bring
up
only
muskets
to
support
an
already
broken
line
nevertheless
these
northerners
were
so
roughly
handled
that
there
was
practically
no
pursuit
when
the
confederates
fell
back
every
one
of
the
federal
regiments
had
been
engaged
and
there
were
no
fresh
troops
wherewith
to
follow
them
jackson
was
perfectly
justified
in
reporting
that
night
and
an
indisposition
of
the
enemy
to
press

the

more
remarkable

is
seldom
that
a
battle
so
insignificant
as
kernstown
has
been
followed
by
such
extraordinary
results
fortune
indeed
favoured
the
confederates
at
the
time
of
the
battle
a
large
portion
of
mcclellan
army
was
at
sea
and
the
attack
was
delivered
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
most
dreaded
by
the
northern
government
nor
was
it
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
southerners
that
the
real
head
of
the
federal
army
was
the
president
and
that
his
strategical
conceptions
were
necessarily
subservient
to
the
attitude
of
the
northern
people
these
were
circumstances
purely
fortuitous
and
it
might
seem
therefore
that
jackson
merely
blundered
into
success
but
he
must
be
given
full
credit
for
recognizing
that
a
blow
at
banks
might
be
fraught
with
most
important
consequences
it
was
with
other
ideas
than
defeating
a
or
detaining
banks
that
he
seized
the
kernstown
ridge
he
was
not
yet
aware
of
mcclellan
plan
of
invasion
by
sea
but
he
knew
well
that
any
movement
that
would
threaten
washington
must
prove
embarrassing
to
the
federal

they
could
not
afford
to
leave

active

enterprising
enemy
who
had
shown
himself
determined

take

advantage

opportunity
was
within

probably
cause
them
to
withdraw

from

to
guard
the
river

fortnight

by
the
brigade
commander
we
find
that
in
garnett
four
regiments
numbering
officers
and
men
there
fell
in
addition
were
reported
missing
but
according
to
the
official
reports
the
majority
of
these
were
captured
by
the
federal
cavalry
and
were
unwounded
at
most
then
when
he
gave
the
order
to
retreat
garnett
had
lost
or
rather
less
than
per
cent
such
loss
was
heavy
but
by
no
means
excessive
a
few
months
later
hardly
a
brigade
in
either
army
would
have
given
way
because
every
fifth
man
had
fallen
a
year
later
and
the
stonewall
regiments
would
have
considered
an
action
in
which
they
lost
men
as
nothing
more
than
a
skirmish
on
march
in
the
battle
fought
on
the
arid
ridges
of
barossa
the
numbers
were
almost
identical
with
those
engaged
at
kernstown
out
of
british
soldiers
there
fell
in
an
hour
over
and
of
french
more
than
were
killed
or
wounded
and
yet
although
the
victors
were
hours
under
arms
without
food
the
issue
was
never
doubtful
the
truth
would
seem
to
be
that
the
valley
soldiers
were
not
yet
blooded
in
peace
the
individual
is
everything
material
prosperity
and
the
preservation
of
existence
are
the
general
aim
in
war
the
individual
is
nothing
and
men
learn
the
lesson
of
but
it
is
only
gradually
however
high
the
enthusiasm
which
inspires
the
troops
that
the
ideas
of
peace
become
effaced
and
they
must
be
seasoned
soldiers
who
will
endure
without
flinching
the
losses
of
waterloo
or
gettysburg
discipline
which
means
the
effacement
of
the
individual
does
more
than
break
the
soldier
to
unhesitating
obedience
it
trains
him
to
die
for
duty
sake
and
even
the
stonewall
brigade
in
the
spring
of
was
not
yet
thoroughly
disciplined
the
lack
of
competent
and
energetic
officers
writes
jackson
chief
of
the
staff
was
at
this
time
the
bane
of
the
service
in
many
there
was
neither
an
intelligent
comprehension
of
their
duties
nor
zeal
in
their
performance
appointed
by
the
votes
of
their
neighbours
and
friends
they
would
neither
exercise
that
rigidity
in
governing
nor
that
detailed
care
in
providing
for
the
wants
of
their
men
which
are
necessary
to
keep
soldiers
efficient
the
duties
of
the
drill
and
the
were
often
negligently
performed
and
the
most
profuse
waste
of
ammunition
and
other
military
stores
was
permitted
it
was
seldom
that
these
officers
were
guilty
of
cowardice
upon
the
field
of
battle
but
they
were
often
in
the
wrong
place
fighting
as
common
soldiers
when
they
should
have
been
directing
others
above
all
was
their
inefficiency
marked
in
their
inability
to
keep
their
men
in
the
ranks
absenteeism
grew
under
them
to
a
monstrous
evil
and
every
poltroon
and
laggard
found
a
way
of
escape
hence
the
frequent
phenomenon
that
regiments
which
on
the
books
of
the
commissary
appeared
as
consumers
of
or
rations
were
reported
as
carrying
into
action
or
bayonets
dabney
volume
pages
and
it
is
unlikely
that
this
picture
is
and
it
is
certainly
no
reproach
to
the
virginia
soldiers
that
their
discipline
was
indifferent
there
had
not
yet
been
time
to
transform
a
multitude
of
raw
recruits
into
the
semblance
of
a
regular
army
competent
instructors
and
trained
leaders
were
few
in
the
extreme
and
the
work
had
to
be
left
in
inexperienced
hands
one
stonewall
jackson
was
insufficient
to
leaven
a
division
of
men
in
the
second
place
jackson
probably
remembered
that
the
stonewall
brigade
at
bull
run
dashing
out
with
the
bayonet
on
the
advancing
federals
had
driven
them
back
on
their
reserves
it
seems
hardly
probable
had
garnett
at
kernstown
held
his
ground
a
little
longer
that
the
three
regiments
still
intact
could
have
turned
the
tide
of
battle
but
it
is
not
impossible
the
federals
had
been
roughly
handled
their
losses
had
been
heavier
than
those
of
the
confederates
a
resolute
counterstroke
has
before
now
changed
the
face
of
battle
and
among
unseasoned
soldiers
panic
spreads
with
extraordinary
effect
so
far
as
can
be
gathered
from
the
reports
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
vigour
of
the
federal
battalions
was
as
yet
relaxed
but
no
one
who
was
not
actually
present
can
presume
to
judge
of
the
temper
of
the
troops
in
every
battle
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
combatants
on
both
sides
become
exhausted
and
the
general
who
at
that
moment
finds
it
in
his
heart
to
make
one
more
effort
will
generally
succeed
such
was
the
experience
of
grant
virginia
stoutest
enemy
memoirs
that
moment
perhaps
had
come
at
kernstown
and
jackson
than
whom
not
skobeleff
himself
had
clearer
vision
or
cooler
brain
in
the
tumult
of
battle
may
have
observed
it
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
that
numbers
go
for
little
on
the
it
is
possible
that
jackson
had
in
his
mind
when
he
declared
that
the
victory
might
yet
have
been
won
the
decisive
counterstroke
at
marengo
where
austrians
pressing
forward
in
pursuit
of
a
defeated
enemy
were
utterly
overthrown
by
a
fresh
division
of
men
supported
by
four
squadrons
the
morning
after
the
battle
one
of
the
confederate
officers
expressed
the
opinion
that
even
if
the
counterstroke
had
been
successful
the
federal
reserves
would
have
arrested
it
jackson
answered
no
if
i
had
routed
the
men
on
the
ridge
they
would
all
have
gone
off
together
tactical
unity
and
morale
are
factors
of
far
more
importance
in
battle
than
mere
numerical
strength
troops
that
have
been
hotly
engaged
even
with
success
and
whose
nerves
are
wrought
up
to
a
high
state
of
tension
are
peculiarly
susceptible
to
surprise
if
they
have
lost
their
order
and
the
men
find
themselves
under
strange
officers
with
unfamiliar
faces
beside
them
the
counterstroke
falls
with
even
greater
force
it
is
at
such
moments
that
cavalry
still
finds
its
opportunity
it
is
at
such
moments
that
a
resolute
charge
pushed
home
with
drums
beating
and
a
loud
cheer
may
have
extraordinary
results

after

hours
fierce
fighting
from
the
great
wood

bore
down
upon
the
last
stronghold
of
the
french
the
troops
were
in
the
utmost
confusion
divisions
brigades
regiments
and
companies
were
mingled
in
one
motley
mass
but
the
enemy
was
retreating
a
heavy
force
of
artillery
was
close
at
hand
and
the
infantry
must
have
numbered
at
least
rifles
suddenly
three
battalions
of
turcos
numbering
no
more
than
bayonets
charged
with
wild
cries
and
without
firing
down
the
grassy
slope
the
germans
halted
fired
a
few
harmless
volleys
and
then
turning
as
one
man
bolted
to
the
shelter
of
the
wood
twelve
hundred
yards
in
rear
according
to
an
officer
of
the
indiana
the
federals
at
kernstown
were
in
much
the
same
condition
as
the
germans
at
worth
the
confederates
fell
back
in
great
disorder
and
we
advanced
in
disorder
just
as
great
over

through
woods
over
hills
and
fields
the
brigades

and
companies
advanced
in
one
promiscuous
mixed
and
uncontrollable
mass

shouted
themselves
hoarse
in
trying
to
bring
order
out

all

garnett
conduct
was
not
the
only
incident
connected
with

that

was
a
sunday
you
appear
much
concerned
he
writes
to
his
wife
at
my
attacking
on
sunday
i
am
greatly
concerned
too
but
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
do
it
in
consideration
of
the
ruinous
effects
that
might
result
from
postponing
the
battle
until
the
morning
so
far
as
i
can
see
my
course
was
a
wise
one
the
best
that
i
could
do
under
the
circumstances
though
very
distasteful
to
my
feelings
and
i
hope
and
pray
to
our
heavenly
father
that
i
may
never
again
be
circumstanced
as
on
that
day
i
believed
that
so
far
as
our
troops
were
concerned
necessity
and
mercy
both
called
for
the
battle
i
do
hope
that
the
war
will
soon
be
over
and
that
i
shall
never
again
be
called
upon
to
take
the

arms
is
a
profession
that
if
its
principles
are
adhered
to
requires
an
officer
to
do
what
he
fears
may
be
wrong
and
yet
according
to
military
experience
must
be
done
if
success
is
to
be
attained
and
the
fact
of
its
being
necessary
to
success
and
being
accompanied
with
success
and
that
a
departure
from
it
is
accompanied
with
disaster
suggests
that
it
must
be
right
had
i
fought
the
battle
on
monday
instead
of
sunday
i
fear
our
cause
would
have
suffered
whereas
as
things
turned
out
i
consider
our
cause
gained
much
from
the
engagement
we
may
wonder
if
his
wife
detected
the
unsoundness
of
the
argument
to
do
wrong
for
wrong
it
was
according
to
her
creed
in
order
that
good
may
ensue

what
it
comes

the
literal
interpretation

the
scriptural

to
have
led
her

into
difficulties

the
incident
may
serve
to
show
with
what
earnestness
in
every
action
of
his
life
he
strove
to
shape
his
conduct
with
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
it
has
already
been
observed
that
jackson
reticence
was
remarkable
no
general
could
have
been
more
careful
that
no
inkling
of
his
design
should
reach
the
enemy
he
had
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
withholding
his
plans
from
even
his
second
in
command
special
correspondents
were
rigorously
excluded
from
his
camps
and
even
with
his
most
confidential
friends
his
reserve
was
absolutely
impenetrable
during
his
stay
at
winchester
it
was
his
custom
directly
he
rose
to
repair
to
headquarters
and
open
his
correspondence
when
he
returned
to
breakfast
at
graham
there
was
much
anxiety
evinced
to
hear
the
news
from
the
front
what
the
enemy
was
doing
across
the
potomac
scarce
thirty
miles
away
was
naturally
of
intense
interest
to
the
people
of
the
border
town
but
not
the
smallest
detail
of
intelligence
however
unimportant
escaped
his
lips
to
his
wife
he
was
as
uncommunicative
as
to
the
rest
neither
hint
nor
suggestion
made
the
least
impression
and
direct
interrogations
were
put
by
with
a
quiet
smile
nor
was
he
too
shy
to
suggest
to
his
superiors
that
silence
was
golden
in
a
report
to
johnston
written
four
days
after
kernstown
he
administered
what
can
scarcely
be
considered
other
than
a
snub
delicately
expressed
but
unmistakable
it
is
understood
in
the
federal
army
that
you
have
instructed
me
to
keep
the
forces
now
in
this
district
and
not
permit
them
to
cross
the
blue
ridge
and
that
this
must
be
done
at
every
hazard
and
that
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
this
i
made
my
attack
i
have
never
so
much
as
intimated
such
a
thing
to
anyone
volume
part
page
it
can
not
be
said
that
jackson
judgment
in
attacking
shields
was
at
once
appreciated
in
the
south
the
defeat
at
first
was
ranked
with
the
disasters
in
the
west
but
as
soon
as
the
effects
upon
the
enemy
were
appreciated
the
tide
of
popular
feeling
turned
the
gallantry
of
the
valley
regiments
was
fully
recognised
and
the
thanks
of
congress
were
tendered
to
jackson
and
his
troops
no
battle
was
ever
yet
fought
in
exact
accordance
with
the
demands
of
theory
and
kernstown
great
in
its
results
gives
openings
to
the
critics
jackson
it
is
said
attacked
with
tired
troops
on
insufficient
information
and
contrary
to
orders
as
to
the
first
it
may
be
said
that
his
decision
to
give
the
enemy
no
time
to
bring
up
fresh
troops
was
absolutely
justified
by
events
on
hearing
of
his
approach
to
kernstown
banks
immediately
countermarched
a
brigade
of
williams
division
from
castleman
ferry
a
second
brigade
was
recalled
from
snicker
gap
on
the
morning
of
the
and
reached
winchester
the
same
evening
after
a
march
of
miles
had
attack
been
deferred
shields
would
have
been
strongly
reinforced
as
to
the
second
jackson
had
used
every
means
in
his
power
to
get
accurate
intelligence
the
truth
is
that
in
war
accurate
intelligence
especially
when
two
armies
are
in
close
contact
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
obtain
at
jena
even
after
the
battle
ended
napoleon
believed
that
the
prussians
had
put
men
in
line
instead
of
the
night
before
eylau
misled
by
the
reports
of
murat
cavalry
he
was
convinced
that
the
russians
were
retreating
and
before
ligny
he
underestimated
blucher
strength
by
the
curious
misconceptions
under
which
the
germans
commenced
the
battles
of
spicheren
and
gravelotte
will
also
occur
to
the
military
reader
ashby
had
done
his
best
although
the
federals
had
cavalry
present
and
every
approach
to
winchester
was
strongly
picketed
his
scouts
had
pushed
within
the
federal
lines
and
had
communicated
with
the
citizens
of
winchester
their
reports
were
confirmed
according
to
jackson
despatch
from
a
source
which
had
been
remarkable
for
its
reliability
and
for
the
last
two
days
a
retrograde
movement
towards
snicker
gap
had
been
reported
the
ground
it
is
true
favoured
an
ambush
but
the
strategic
situation
demanded
instant
action
mcclellan
advanced
guard
was
within
fifty
miles
of
johnston
position
on
the
rapidan
and
a
few
days
march
might
bring
the
main
armies
into
collision
if
jackson
was
to
bring
banks
back
to
the
valley
and
himself
join
johnston
before
the
expected
battle
he
had
no
time
to
spare
moreover
the
information
to
hand
was
quite
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
trusting
something
to
fortune
even
a
defeat
if
the
attack
were
resolutely
pushed
might
have
the
best
effect
the
third
reproach
that
jackson
disobeyed
orders
can
hardly
be
sustained
he
was
in
command
of
a
detached
force
operating
at
a
distance
from
the
main
army
and
johnston
with
a
wise
discretion
had
given
him
not
orders
but
instructions
that
is
the
had
merely
indicated
the
purpose
for
which
force
had
been
detached
and
left
to
his
judgment
the
manner
in
which
that
purpose
was
to
be
achieved
johnston
had
certainly
suggested
that
he
should
not
expose
himself
to
the
danger
of
defeat
but
when
it
became
clear
that
he
could
not
retain
the
enemy
in
the
valley
unless
he
closed
with
him
to
have
refrained
from
attack
would
have
been
to
disobey
the
spirit
of
his
instructions
again
when
jackson
attacked
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
ran
no
risk
of
defeat
whatever
the
force
before
him
was
reported
as
inferior
to
his
own
and
he
might
well
have
argued
to
confine
myself
to
observation
will
be
to
confess
my
weakness
and
banks
is
not
likely
to
arrest
his
march
to
manassas
because
of
the
presence
of
an
enemy
who
dare
not
attack
an
insignificant
rearguard
demonstrations
such
as
johnston
had
advised
may
undoubtedly
serve
a
temporary
purpose
but
if
protracted
the
enemy
sees
through
them
on
the
for
instance
it
was
reported
to
banks
that
the
confederates
were
advancing
the
rear
brigade
of
williams
division
was
therefore
countermarched
from
snicker
gap
to
berryville
but
the
other
two
were
suffered
to
proceed
had
jackson
remained
quiescent
in
front
of
shields
tacitly
admitting
his
inferiority
the
rear
brigade
would
in
all
probability
have
soon
been
ordered
to
resume
its
march
and
lincoln
with
no
fear
for
washington
would
have
allowed
blenker
and
mcdowell
to
join
mcclellan
johnston
at
least
held
that
his
subordinate
was
justified
in
publishing
the
thanks
of
the
confederate
congress
tendered
to
jackson
and
his
division
he
expressed
at
the
same
time
his
own
sense
of
their
admirable
conduct
by
which
they
fully
earned
the
high
reward
bestowed
during
the
evening
of
the
the
medical
director
of
the
valley
army
was
ordered
to
collect
vehicles
and
send
the
wounded
to
the
rear
before
the
troops
continued
their
retreat
some
time
after
midnight
mcguire
finding
that
there
were
still
a
large
number
awaiting
removal
reported
the
circumstances
to
the
general
adding
that
he
did
not
know
where
to
get
the
means
of
transport
and
that
unless
some
expedient
were
discovered
the
men
must
be
abandoned
jackson
ordered
him
to
impress
carriages
in
the
neighbourhood
but
said
the
surgeon
that
requires
time
can
you
stay
till

skirmish
with

reached
the

of

ten
miles
south
the
same
evening
the
main
body
occupied
woodstock
and
mcclellan
telegraphed
that
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
vigorous
pursuit
it
is
not
impossible
that
banks
suspected
that
commendations
were
ironical
in
any
case
praise
had
no
more
effect
upon
him
than
a
peremptory
order
or
the
promise
of
reinforcements
he
was
instructed
to
push
forward
as
far
as
new
market
he
was
told
that
he
would
be
joined
by
two
regiments
of
cavalry
and
that
two
brigades
of
blenker
division
were
marching
to

but
jackson
although
ashby
had
been
driven
in
still
held
obstinately
to
his
position
and
from
woodstock
and
edenburg
banks
refused
to
move
on
april
becoming
independent
of
mcclellan
on
this
date
mcclellan
ceased
to
be
he
at
once
reported
to
the
secretary
of
war
that
he
hoped
immediately
to
strike
jackson
an
effective
blow
immediately
however
in
banks
opinion
was
capable
of
a
very
liberal
interpretation
for
it
was
not
till
april
that
he
once
more
broke
up
his
camps
well
might
gordon
write
that
life
at
edenburg
became
monotonous
it
is
but
fair
to
mention
that
during
the
whole
of
this
time
banks
was
much
troubled
about
supply
and
transport
his
magazines
were
at
winchester
connected
with
harper
ferry
and
washington
by
a
line
of
railway
which
had
been
rapidly
repaired
and
on
april
this
line
had
become
unserviceable
through
the
spreading
of
the
the
bridges
over
the
railway
between
strasburg
and
manassas
gap
which
would
have
made
a
second
line
available
had
not
yet
been
repaired
his
waggon
train
moreover
had
been
diverted
to
manassas
before
the
fight
at
kernstown
and
was
several
days
late
in
reaching
strasburg
the
country
in
which
he
was
operating
was
rich
and
requisitions
were
made
upon
the
farmers
but
in
the
absence
of
the
waggons
according
to
his
own
report
it
was
impossible
to
collect
sufficient
supplies
for
a
further
advance
on
april
jackson
wrote
that
the
country
around
banks
was
very
much
drained
of
forage
the
weather
too
had
been
unfavourable
the
first
days
of
april
were
like
summer
but
hardly
says
gordon
had
we
begun
to
feel
in
harmony
with
sunny
days
and
blooming
peach
trees
and
warm
showers
before
a
chill
came
over
us
bitter
as
the
hatred
of
the
women
of
virginia
the
ground
covered
with
snow
the
air
thick
with
hail
and
the
mountains
hidden
in
the
chilly
atmosphere
our
shivering
sentinels
on
the
outer
lines
met
at
times
the
gaze
of
horsemen
of
the
enemy
peering
through
the
mist
to
see
what
the
yankees
had
been
doing
within
the
last
hours
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
we
were
in
the
south
all
this
however
was
hardly
an
excuse
for
absolute
inaction
the
confederate
position
on
the
open
ridge
called
rude
hill
two
and
a
half
miles
south
of
mount
jackson
was
certainly
strong
it
was
defended
in
front
by
mill
creek
swollen
by
the
snows
to
a
turbulent
and
unfordable
river
and
by
the
north
fork
of
the
shenandoah
but
with
all
its
natural
strength
rude
hill
was
but
weakly
held
and
banks
knew
it
moreover
it
was
most
unlikely
that
jackson
would
be
reinforced
for
johnston
army
with
the
exception
of
a
detachment
under
general
ewell
had
left
orange
court
house
for
richmond
on
april
the
enemy
banks
wrote
to
mcclellan
on
april
is
reduced
to
about
men
sic
much
demoralised
by
defeat
desertion
and
the
general
depression
of
spirits
resting
on
the
southern
army
he
is
not
in
a
condition
to
attack
neither
to
make
a
strong
resistance
and
i
do
not
believe
he
will
make
a
determined
stand
there
i
do
not
believe
johnston
will
reinforce
him
if
banks
had
supplies
enough
to
enable
him
to
remain
at
woodstock
there
seems
to
have
been
no
valid
reason
why
he
should
not
have
been
able
to
drive
away
a
demoralised
enemy
and
to
hold
a
position
twelve
miles
further
south
but
the
federal
commander
despite
his
brave
words
had
not
yet
got
rid
of
his
misgivings
jackson
had
lured
him
into
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
between
the
two
branches
of
the
shenandoah
in
the
very
centre
of
the
valley
rises
a
gigantic
mass
of
mountain
ridges
parallel
throughout
their
length
of
fifty
miles
to
the
blue
ridge
and
the
alleghanies
these
are
the
famous
massanuttons

glory
of
the

the
peaks
which
form
their
northern
faces
sink
as
abruptly

the

by

to
the
east
is
the
narrower
and
less
open
the
blue
ridge
is
nowhere
more
than
ten
miles
distant
from
the
massanuttons
and
the
space
between
them
the
luray
or
the
south

which
a

road
leads
northward
is
clothed
by

here
in
the
valley
of
the
north
fork
is
freer
air
and
more
space
for
movement
the
separation
of
the
two
valleys
is
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
save
at
one
point
only
the
massanuttons
are
practically
impassable

approach

line

at

down

deep
valleys
the

by
which
to

that

of

the
federal
outposts
our
stay
at
edenburg
says
gordon
was
a
continuous
season
of
artillery
brawling
and
picket
stalking
the
creek
that
separated
the
outposts
was
not
more
than
ten
yards
wide
about
of
a
mile
away
there
was
a
thick
wood
in
which
the
enemy
concealed
his
batteries
until
he
chose
to
stir
us
up
when
he
would
sneak
up
behind
the
cover
open
upon
us
at
an
unexpected
moment
and
retreat
rapidly
when
we
replied
it
was
doubtless
by
such
constant
evidence
of
his
vigilance
that
ashby
imposed
caution
on
the
enemy
reconnoitring
parties
the
fact
remains
that
camps
six
miles
to
the
rear
were
never
once
alarmed
nor
could
banks
obtain
any
reliable
information
this
period
of
repose
was
spent
by
jackson
in
reorganising
his
regiments
in
writing
letters
to
his
wife
and
like
his
old
gordon
in
admiring
the
scenery
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
his
enforced
inaction
was
altogether
to
his
taste
with
an
enemy
within
sight
of
his
outposts
his
bold
and
aggressive
spirit
must
have
been
sorely
tried
but
with
his
inferior
numbers
prudence
cried
patience
and
he
had
reason
to
be
well
content
with
the
situation
he
had
been
instructed
to
prevent
banks
from
detaching
troops
to
reinforce
mcclellan
to
attain
an
object
in
war
the
first
consideration
is
to
make
no
mistakes
yourself
the
next
to
take
instant
advantage
of
those
made
by
your
opponent
but
compliance
with
this
rule
does
not
embrace
the
whole
art
of
generalship
the
enemy
may
be
too
discreet
to
commit
himself
to
risky
manoeuvres
if
the
campaigns
of
the
great
masters
of
war
are
examined
it
will
be
found
that
they
but
seldom
adopted
a
quiescent
attitude
but
by
one
means
or
another
by
acting
on
their
adversary
morale
or
by
creating
false
impressions
they
induced
him
to
make
a
false
step
and
to
place
himself
in
a
position
which
made
it
easy
for
them
to
attain
their
object
the
greatest
general
has
been
defined
as
he
who
makes
the
fewest
mistakes
but
he
who
compels
his
adversary
to
make
the
most
mistakes
is
a
definition
of
equal
force
and
it
may
even
be
questioned
whether
the
general
whose
imagination
is
unequal
to
the
stratagems
which
bring
mistakes
about
is
worthy
of
the
name
he
may
be
a
trustworthy
subordinate
but
he
can
scarcely
become
a
great
leader
johnston
had
advised
when
at
the
beginning
of
march
the
retreat
of
the
confederates
from
winchester
was
determined
on
that
jackson
should
fall
back
on
front
royal
and
thence
if
necessary
up
the
south
fork
of
the
shenandoah
his
force
would
thus
be
in
close
communication
with
the
main
army
behind
the
rapidan
and
it
was
contrary
in
the
opinion
to
all
sound
discretion
to
permit
the
enemy
to
attain
a
point
such
as
front
royal
which
would
render
it
possible
for
him
to
place
himself
between
them
jackson
however
declared
his
preference
for
a
retreat
up
the
north
fork
in
the
direction
of
staunton
why
should
banks
join
mcclellan
at
all
mcclellan
so
jackson
calculated
had
already
more
men
with
him
than
he
could
feed
and
he
believed
therefore
that
staunton
would
be
banks
objective
because
by
seizing
that
town
he
would
threaten
edward
johnson
rear
open
the
way
for
fremont
and
then
crossing
the
blue
ridge
place
himself
so
near
the
communications
of
the
main
army
with
richmond
that
it
would
be
compelled
to
fall
back
to
defend
them
nor
in
any
case
did
he
agree
with
johnston
that
the
occupation
of
front
royal
would
prevent
banks
leaving
the
valley
and
marching
to
manassas
twenty
miles
due
east
of
winchester
is
snicker
gap
where
a
good
road
crosses
the
blue
ridge
and
eight
miles
south
another
turnpike
leads
over
ashby
gap
by
either
of
these
banks
could
reach
manassas
just
as
rapidly
as
jackson
could
join
johnston
and
while
men
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
detain
they
might
very
easily
be
cut
off
by
a
portion
of
the
superior
force
if
a
junction
with
the
main
army
were
absolutely
necessary
jackson
was
of
opinion
that
the
move
ought
to
be
made
at
once
and
the
valley
abandoned
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
desirable
to
keep
banks
and
mcclellan
separated
the
best
means
of
doing
so
was
to
draw
the
former
up
the
north
fork
and
at
mount
jackson
covering
the
new
market
to
luray
road
the
valley
troops
would
be
as
near
the
rapidan
as
if
they
were
at
front

dabney
volume

and
volume
page
the
strategical
advantages
which
such
a
position
would
offer
the
isolation
of
the
troops
pursuing
him
the
chance
of
striking
their
communications
from
the
south
fork
valley
and
if
reinforcements
were
granted
of
cutting
off
their
retreat
by
a
rapid
movement
from
luray
to
winchester
were
always
present
to
jackson
mind
cf
letters
of
april
volume
part
pages
and
an
additional
argument
was
that
at
the
time
when
these
alternatives
were
discussed
the
road
along
south
fork
was
so
bad
as
to
make
marching
difficult
and
it
was
to
this
rather
than
to
strategical
conceptions
that
johnston
appears
to
have
ultimately
yielded
be
this
as
it
may
the
sum
of
jackson
operations
was
satisfactory

although

intervention
was
impracticable
he
was
none
the

very
strong
communication
with
both

richmond
was
secure

so
long
as
he
held
the

threatened
the
flank

they
advance

dabney

objection

have
been

from

further

returning

far

the
separation
of

fremont
and
blenker
and
the
forward
position
of
the
two
former
which
he
had
determined
to
maintain
was
even
more
dangerous
jackson
had
recognised
all
along
the
mistake
the
federals
had
made
in
pushing
comparatively
small
forces
up
the
valley
before
mcclellan
closed
in
on
richmond

very
cautious

suppose

mcclellan
is
at
the

and
that
he
would
not
even
if

desired
permit
him
to
advance
much
farther

did
not
know
that
at
the

he

his
lesson
was
to
come
for
jackson
by
no
means
content
with
arresting
banks
march
was
already
contemplating
that
general
destruction
the
situation
demanded
instant
action
and
in
order
that
the
import
of
jackson
movements
may
be
fully
realised
it
is
necessary
to
turn
to
the
main
theatre
of
war
mcclellan
on
april
with
the
men
already
landed
had
moved
a
few
miles
up
the
peninsula
near
the
village
of
yorktown
famous
for
the
surrender
of
lord
cornwallis
and
his
army
in
he
found
the
road
blocked
by
a
line
of
earthworks
and
numerous
guns
magruder
jackson
captain
in
mexico
was
in
command
but
johnston
was
still
on
the
rapidan
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
away
and
the
confederates
had
no
more
than
men
in
position
the
flanks
however
were
secured
by
the
york
and
the
james
rivers
which
here
expand
to
wide
estuaries
and
the
works
were
strong
yorktown
proved
almost
as
fatal
to
the
invaders
as
to
their
english
predecessors
before
the
historic
lines
their
march
was
suddenly
brought
up
mcclellan
although
his
army
increased
in
numbers
every
day
declined
the
swift
process
of
a
storm
personal
reconnaissance
convinced
him
that
instant
assault
would
have
been
simple
folly
and
he
determined
to
besiege
the
intrenchments
in
due
form
on
april
johnston
army
began
to
arrive
at
yorktown
and
the
lines
hitherto
held
by
a
slender
garrison
were
now
manned
by
men
the
confederate
position
was
by
no
means
impregnable
the
river
james
to
the
south
was
held
by
the
merrimac
an
improvised
ironclad
of
novel
design
which
had
already
wrought
terrible
destruction
amongst
the
wooden
frigates
of
the
federals
she
was
neutralised
however
by
her
northern
counterpart
the
monitor
and
after
an
indecisive
action
she
had
remained
inactive
for
nearly
a
month
the
york
was
less
securely
guarded
the
channel
nearly
a
mile
wide
was
barred
only
by
the
fire
of
two
forts
and
that
at
gloucester
point
on
the
north
bank
was
open
to
assault
from
the
land
side
had
mcclellan
disembarked
a
detachment
and
carried
this
work
which
might
easily
have
been
done
the
river
would
have
been
opened
to
his
gunboats
and
johnston
lines
have
become
untenable
he
decided
however
notwithstanding
that
his
army
was
more
than
strong
that
he
had
no
men
to
spare
for
such
an
enterprise
magruder
bold
stand
was
of
infinite
service
to
the
confederate
cause
to
both
parties
time
was
of
the
utmost
value
the
federals
were
still
over
seventy
miles
from
richmond
and
there
was
always
a
possibility
if
their
advance
were
not
rapidly
pressed
that
johnston
might
move
on
washington
and
cause
the
recall
of
the
army
to
protect
the
capital
the
confederates
on
the
other
hand
had
been
surprised
by
the
landing
of
mcclellan
army
they
had
been
long
aware
that
the
flotilla
had
sailed
but
they
had
not
discovered
its
destination
the
detachments
which
first
landed
were
supposed
to
be
reinforcements
for
the
garrison
of
the
fortress
and
when
mcclellan
advanced
on
yorktown
johnston
was
far
to
the
west
of
richmond
the
delay
had
enabled
him
to
reach
the
lines
the
first
detachment
of
federals
embarked
at
alexandria
on
march
and
the
army
was
thereafter
transferred
to
the
peninsula
by
successive
divisions
on
march
johnston
was
ordered
to
be
ready
to
move
to
richmond
on
april
he
was
ordered
to
move
at
once
on
that
date
federals
had
landed
but
at
the
time
jackson
fell
back
to
elk
run
valley
april
to
fortune
seemed
inclining
to
the
federals
lincoln
had
been
induced
to
relax
his
hold
on
the
army
corps
which
he
had
held
back
at
manassas
to
protect
the
capital
and
mcdowell
was
already
moving
on
fredericksburg
sixty
miles
north
of
richmond
here
he
was
to
be
joined
by
shields
bringing
his
force
for
the
field
up
to
men
and
the
fall
of
yorktown
was
to
be
the
signal
for
his
advance
on
the
confederate
capital
johnston
still
held
the
lines
but
he
was
outnumbered
by
more
than
two
to
one
and
the
enemy
was
disembarking
heavy
ordnance
it
was
evident
that
the
end
could
not
be
long
delayed
and
that
in
case
of
retreat
every
single
confederate
soldier
from
the
valley
and
elsewhere
would
have
to
be
brought
to
richmond
for
the
decisive
battle
jackson
was
thus
bound
to
his
present
position
close
to
the
railway
and
his
orders
from
johnston
confined
him
to
a
strictly
defensive
attitude
in
case
banks
advanced
eastward
he
was
to
combine
with
ewell
and
receive
attack
in
the
passes
of
the
blue
ridge
such
cautious
strategy
to
one
so
fully
alive
to
the
opportunity
offered
by
mcclellan
retention
before
yorktown
was
by
no
means
acceptable
when
his
orders
reached
him
jackson
was
already
weaving
plans
for
the
discomfiture
of
his
immediate
adversary
and
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
reluctance
although
he
gave
no
vent
to
his
chagrin
he
accepted
the
passive
role
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
no
sooner
however
had
he
reached
elk
run
valley
than
the
telegraph
brought
most
welcome
news
in
a
moment
of
unwonted
wisdom
the
confederate
president
had
charged
general
lee
with
the
control
of
all
military
operations
in
virginia
and
on
april
came
a
letter
to
jackson
which
foreshadowed
the
downfall
of
mcclellan
and
the
rout
of
the
invaders
april
mcdowell
advance
from
manassas
had
already
become
known
to
the
confederates
and
lee
had
divined
what
this
movement
portended
i
have
no
doubt
he
wrote
to
jackson
that
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
occupy
fredericksburg
and
use
it
as
a
base
of
operations
against
richmond
our
present
force
there
is
very
small
men
under
general
field
and
can
not
be
reinforced
except
by
weakening
other
corps
if
you
can
use
general
ewell
division
in
an
attack
on
banks
it
will
prove
a
great
relief
to
the
pressure
on
fredericksburg
volume
part
page
this
view
of
the
situation
was
in
exact
agreement
with
jackson
own
views
he
had
already
made
preparation
for
combined
action
with
ewell
for
some
days
they
had
been
in
active
correspondence
the
exact
route
which
ewell
should
take
to
the
blue
ridge
had
been
decided
on
the
roads
had
been
reconnoitred
jackson
had
supplied
a
map
identical
with
his
own
and
had
furnished
an
officer
to
act
as
guide
a
service
of
couriers
had
been
established
across
the
mountains
and
no
precaution
had
been
neglected
ewell
was
instructed
to
bring
five
days
rations
he
was
warned
that
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
a
forced
march
he
was
to
encamp
at
and
he
was
to
rest
on
sunday
volume
part
pages
and
april
jackson
replying
to
lee
stated
that
he
was
only
waiting
a
favourable
occasion
to
fall
on
banks
my
object
he
wrote
has
been
to
get
in
his
rear
at
new
market
or
harrisonburg
if
he
gives
me
an
opportunity
and
this
would
be
the
case
should
he
advance
on
staunton
with
his
main
body
it
appears
to
me
that
if
i
remain
quiet
a
few
days
more
he
will
probably
make
a
move
in
some
direction
or
send
a
large
force
towards
harrisonburg
and
thus
enable
me
with
the
blessing
of
providence
to
successfully
attack
his
advance
if
i
am
unsuccessful
in
driving
back
his
entire
force
he
may
be
induced
to
move
forward
from
new
market
and
attempt
to
follow
me
through
this
gap
where
our
forces
would
have
greatly
the
advantage
under
all
the
circumstances
i
will
direct
general
ewell
to
move
to
stanardsville
should
banks
remain
in
the
position
of
yesterday
cavalry
at
harrisonburg
infantry
at
new
market
i
will
try
and
seek
an
opportunity
of
attacking
successfully
some
part
of
his
army
and
if
circumstances
justify
press
forward
my
instructions
from
general
johnston
were
to
unite
with
general
ewell
near
the
top
of
the
blue
ridge
and
give
battle
the
course
i
propose
would
be
departing
from
general
johnston
instructions
but
i
do
not
believe
that
banks
will
follow
me
to
the
blue
ridge
unless
i
first
engage
him
and
i
doubt
whether
he
will
then
but
although
authorised
to
draw
ewell
to
himself
and
to
carry
out
the
project
on
which
his
heart
was
set
he
still
kept
in
view
the
general
situation
after
he
had
dispatched
the
above
letter
a
report
came
in
which
led
him
to
believe
that
ewell
was
more
needed
on
the
rappahannock
than
in
the
valley
lee
had
already
informed
him
that
mcdowell
advanced
guard
had
occupied
falmouth
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
opposite
fredericksburg
on
april
and
that
general
field
had
fallen
back
jackson
in
consequence
permitted
ewell
to
remain
near
gordonsville
close
to
the
railway
assuring
lee
that
he
would
make
arrangements
so
as
not
to
be
disappointed
should
ewell
be
ordered
to
fredericksburg
volume
part
pages
and
nor
was
this
the
only
instance
in
which
he
demonstrated
his
breadth
of
view
in
planning
with
ewell
that
general
had
suggested
that
he
should
take
a
different
road
to
that
which
had
been
recommended
by
general
johnston
should
necessity
for
a
combined
movement
arise
jackson
protested
against
the
route
being
altered
general
johnston
he
wrote
does
not
state
why
he
desires
you
to
go
by
this
road
but
it
may
be
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving
the
enemy
with
regard
to
your
ultimate
destination
to
be
more
distant
from
the
enemy
during
the
movement
and
also
to
be
in
a
more
favourable
position
for
reinforcing
some
other
points
should
it
be
necessary
the
interests
of
his
own
force
here
as
always
were
subordinated
to
those
of
the
army
which
was
defending
richmond
april
the
next
information
received
from
general
lee
was
that
the
enemy
was
collecting
in
strong
force
at
fredericksburg
for
this
purpose
he
wrote
they
must
weaken
other
points
and
now
is
the
time
to
concentrate
on
any
that
may
be
exposed
within
our
reach
he
then
suggested
that
if
banks
was
too
strong
in
numbers
and
position
jackson
and
ewell
combined
should
move
on
warrenton
where
a
federal
force
was
reported
or
that
ewell
and
field
should
attack
fredericksburg
the
blow
he
added
wherever
struck
must
to
be
successful
be
sudden
and
heavy
the
troops
must
be
efficient
and
light
i
can
not
pretend
at
this
distance
to
direct
operations
depending
on
circumstances
unknown
to
me
and
requiring
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
judgment
as
to
time
and
execution
but
submit
these
ideas
for
your
consideration
jackson
himself
showed
the
same
wise
in
his
communications
with
ewell
after
that
officer
had
been
placed
under
his
orders
but
before
they
had
joined
hands
he
suggested
certain
movements
as
advisable
but
invariably
left
the
ultimate
decision
to
his
subordinate
judgment
april
on
april
when
banks
moved
two
brigades
to
harrisonburg
ewell
was
at
once
called
up
to
stanardsville
twelve
miles
of
swift
run
gap
no
opportunity
as
yet
had
offered
for
attack
i
have
reason
to
believe
wrote
jackson
to
lee
on
the
that
banks
has
men
within
a
day
march
of
me
on
april
banks
and
shields
who
had
been
reinforced
numbered
effective
officers
and
men
of
whom
a
portion
must
have
been
guarding
the
communications
reports
of
april
and
may
volume
part
he
has
moved
his
main
body
from
new
market
to
harrisonburg
leaving
probably
a
brigade
at
new
market
and
between
that
town
and
the
shenandoah
luray
gap
to
guard
against
a
force
getting
in
his
rear
on
yesterday
week
there
were
near
men
in
the
neighbourhood
of
winchester
under
blenker
as
yet
i
have
not
heard
of
their
having
joined
banks
i
propose
to
attack
banks
in
front
if
you
will
send
me
more
men
now
as
it
appears
to
me
is
the
golden
opportunity
for
striking
a
blow
until
i
hear
from
you
i
will
watch
an
opportunity
for
striking
some
exposed
point
it
is
amusing
to
note
how
far
at
this
time
his
staff
officers
were
from
understanding
their
commander
on
this
very
date
one
of
them
wrote
in
a
private
letter
as
sure
as
you
and
i
live
jackson
is
a
cracked
man
and
the
sequel
will
show
it
a
month
later
he
must
have
been
sorry
he
had
posed
as
a
prophet
april
the
next
day
april
jackson
suggested
if
reinforcements
could
not
be
spared
that
one
of
three
plans
should
be
adopted
either
to
leave
ewell
here
swift
run
gap
to
threaten
banks
rear
in
the
event
of
his
advancing
on
staunton
and
move
with
my
command
rapidly
on
the
force
in
front
of
general
edward
johnson
or
else
with
ewell
to
attack
the
enemy
detached
force
between
new
market
and
the
shenandoah
and
if
successful
in
this
then
to
press
forward
and
get
in
banks
rear
at
new
market
and
thus
induce
him
to
fall
back
the
third
is
to
pass
down
the
shenandoah
to
sperryvile
east
of
the
blue
ridge
and
thus
threaten
winchester
via
front
royal
to
get
in
banks
rear
with
my
present
force
would
be
rather
a
dangerous
undertaking
as
i
would
have
to
cross
the
river
and
immediately
cross
the
massanutton
mountains
during
which
the
enemy
would
have
the
advantage
of
position
of
the
three
plans
i
give
the
preference
to
attacking
the
force
west
of
staunton
milroy
for
if
successful
i
would
afterward
only
have
banks
to
contend
with
and
in
doing
this
would
be
reinforced
by
general
edward
johnson
and
by
that
time
you
might
be
able
to
give
me
reinforcements
which
united
with
the
troops
under
my
control
would
enable
me
to
defeat
banks
if
he
should
be
routed
and
his
command
destroyed
nearly
all
our
own
forces
here
could
if
necessary
cross
the
blue
ridge
to
warrenton
fredericksburg
or
any
other
threatened
point
lee
reply
was
to
the
effect
that
no
reinforcements
could
be
spared
but
that
he
had
carefully
considered
the
three
plans
of
operations
proposed
and
that
the
selection
was
left
to
jackson
the
army
of
the
valley
when
the
letter
was
received
had
already
been
put
in
motion
three
roads
lead
from
conrad
store
in
the
elk

to
johnson
position
at

one
through
harrisonburg
the
second
by

cross

the
third
the
river
road
by
port
republic
and
staunton
the
first
of
these
was
already
occupied
by
the
federals
the
second
was
tortuous
and
at
places
almost
within
view
of
the
enemy
camps
while
the
third
though
it
was

jackson
leaving

marched
up

the

unmetalled
and
untended
had
been
turned
into
a
quagmire
by
the
heavy
rains
of
an
ungenial
spring
and
the
troops
marched
only
five
miles
bivouacking
by
the
roadside
may
was
a
day
of
continuous
rain
the
great
mountains
loomed
dimly
through
the
dreary
mist
the
streams
which
rushed
down
the
gorges
to
the
shenandoah
had
swelled
to
brawling
torrents
and
in
the
hollows
of
the
fields
the
water
stood
in
sheets
men
and
horses
floundered
through
the
mud
the
guns
sunk
in
the
treacherous
soil
and
it
was
only
by
the
help
of
large
detachments
of
pioneers
that
the
heavy
waggons
of
the
train
were
able
to
proceed
at
all
it
was
in
vain
that
piles
of
stones
and
brushwood
were
strewn
upon
the
roadway
the
quicksands
dragged
them
down
as
fast
as
they
were
placed
the
utmost
exertions
carried
the
army
no
more
than
five
miles
forward
and
the
troops
bivouacked
once
more
in
the
dripping
woods
may
the
next
day
the
third
in
succession
the
struggle
with
the
elements
continued
the
whole
command
was
called
upon
to
move
the
guns
and
waggons
the
general
and
his
staff
were
seen
dismounted
urging
on
the
labourers
and
jackson
his
uniform
bespattered
with
mud
carried
stones
and
timbers
on
his
own
shoulders
but
before
nightfall
the
last
ambulance
had
been
extricated
from
the
slough
and
the
men
drenched
to
the
skin
and
worn
with
toil
found
a
on
firmer
ground
but
this
was
not
on
the
road
to
staunton
before
they
reached
port
republic
instead
of
crossing
the
shenandoah
and
passing
through
the
village
the
troops
had
been
ordered
to
change
the
direction
of
their
march
the
spot
selected
for
their
bivouac
was
at
the
foot
of
brown
gap
not
more
than
twelve
miles
of
the
camp
in
elk
run
valley
may
the
next
morning
the
clouds
broke
the
sun
shining
with
summer
warmth
ushered
in
a
glorious
may
day
and
the
column
turning
its
back
upon
the
valley
took
the
stony
road
that
led
over
the
blue
ridge
upward
and
eastward
the
battalions
passed
the
great
forest
of
oak
and
pine
rising
high
on
either
hand
until
from
the
eyry
of
the
they
looked
down
upon
the
wide
virginia
plains
far
off
away
to
the
the
trails
of
white
smoke
from
passing
trains
marked
the
line
of
the
central
railroad
and
the
line
of
march
led
directly
to
the
station
at
mechum
river
both
officers
and
men
were
more
than
bewildered
save
to
his
jackson
had
breathed
not
a
whisper
of
his
plan
the
soldiers
only
knew
that
they
were
leaving
the
valley
and
leaving
it
in
the
enemy
possession
winchester
strasburg
front
royal
new
market
harrisonburg
were
full
of
northern
troops
staunton
alone
was
yet
unoccupied
but
staunton
was
closely
threatened
and
north
of
harrisonburg
the
cavalry
were
riding
far
and
wide
while
the
women
and
old
men
looked
impotently
on
village
and
mill
and
farm
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
invaders
already
the
federal
commissaries
had
laid
hands
on
herds
and
granaries
it
is
true
that
the
northerners
waged
war
like
gentlemen
yet
for
all
that
the
patriotism
of
the
valley
soldiers
was
sorely
tried
they
were
ready
to
go
to
richmond
if
the
time
had
come
but
it
was
with
heavy
hearts
that
they
saw
the
blue
ridge
rise
behind
them
and
the
bivouac
on
mechum
river
was
even
more
cheerless
than
the
sodden
woods
near
port
republic
the
long
lines
of
cars
that
awaited
them
at
the
station
but
confirmed
their
anticipations
they
were
evidently
wanted
at
the
capital
and
the
need
was
pressing
still
not
a
word
transpired
as
to
their
destination
may
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
jackson
had
intended
that
the
troops
should
rest
but
early
in
the
morning
came
a
message
from
edward
johnson
fremont
advanced
guard
was
pushing
forward
after
hard
debate
with
himself
says
dabney
who
accompanied
him
and
with
sore
reluctance
jackson
once
more
sacrificed
his
scruples
and
ordered
the
command
to
march
the
infantry
was
to
move
by
rail
the
artillery
and
waggons
by
road
to
their
astonishment
and
delight
the
troops
then
heard
for
the
first
time
that
their
destination
was
not
richmond
but
staunton
and
although
they
were
far
from
understanding
the
reason
for
their
circuitous
march
they
began
to
suspect
that
it
had
not
been
made
without
good
purpose
if
the
soldiers
had
been
heavy
hearted
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
valley
the
people
of
staunton
had
been
plunged
in
the
direst
grief
for
a
long
time
past
they
had
lived
in
a
pitiable
condition
of
uncertainty
on
april
the
sick
and
convalescent
of
the
valley
army
had
been
removed
to
gordonsville
on
the
same
day
jackson
had
moved
to
elk
run
valley
leaving
the
road
from
harrisonburg
completely
open
and
edward
johnson
evacuated
his
position
on
the
shenandoah
mountain
letters
from
jackson
officers
unacquainted
with
the
designs
of
their
commander
had
confirmed
the
apprehension
that
the
federals
were
too
strong
to
be
resisted
on
the
saturday
of
this
anxious
week
had
come
the
news
that
the
army
was
crossing
the
blue
ridge
and
that
the
valley
had
been
abandoned
to
the
enemy
sunday
morning
was
full
of
rumours
and
excitement
federals
it
was
reported
were
advancing
against
johnson
at
west
view
banks
was
moving
from
harrisonburg
his
cavalry
had
been
seen
from
the
neighbouring
hills
and
staunton
believed
that
it
was
to
share
the
fate
of
winchester
suddenly
a
train
full
of
soldiers
steamed
into
the
station
and
as
regiment
after
regiment
clad
in
their
own
confederate
grey
swept
through
the
crowded
streets
confidence
in
stonewall
jackson
began
once
more
to
revive
pickets
were
immediately
posted
on
all
the
roads
leading
to
harrisonburg
and
beyond
the
line
of
sentries
no
one
whatever
his
business
might
be
was
allowed
to
pass
the
following
day
the
remainder
of
the
division
arrived
and
the
junction
with
brigade
was
virtually
effected
may
was
spent
in
resting
the
troops
in
making
the
arrangements
for
the
march
and
in
getting
information
may
the
next
morning
brought
a
fresh
surprise
to
both
troops
and
townsfolk
banks
so
the
rumour
went
was
rapidly
approaching
and
it
was
confidently
expected
that
the
twin
hills
which
stand
above
the
town
christened
by
some
early
settler
after
two
similar
heights
in
faraway
tyrone
betsy
bell
and
mary
gray
would
look
down
upon
a
bloody
battle
but
instead
of
taking
post
to
defend
the
town
the
valley
regiments
filed
away
over
the
western
hills
heading
for
the
alleghanies
and
staunton
was
once
more
left
unprotected
jackson
although
informed
by
ashby
that
banks
so
far
from
moving
forward
was
actually
retiring
on
new
market
was
still
determined
to
strike
first
at
milroy
commanding
fremont
advanced
guard
and
there
can
be
little
question
but
that
his
decision
was
correct
as
we
have
seen
he
was
under
the
impression
that
banks
strength
was
a
force
exceeding
the
united
strength
of
the
confederates
by
men
jackson
ewell
johnson
it
was
undoubtedly
sound
strategy
to
crush
the
weaker
and
more
exposed
of
the
detachments
first
and
then
having
cleared
his
own
rear
and
prevented
all
chance
of
combination
between
banks
and
fremont
to
strike
the
larger
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
harrisonburg
eight
days
had
elapsed
since
jackson
had
marched
from
elk
run
but
banks
was
still
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
blow
that
threatened
fremont
advanced
guard
on
april
he
had
telegraphed
to
washington
that
he
was
entirely
secure
everything
was
satisfactory
the
enemy
he
said
is
in
no
condition
for
offensive
movements
our
supplies
have
not
been
in
so
good
condition
nor
my
command
in
so
good
spirits
since
we
left
winchester
general
hatch
commanding
cavalry
made
a
reconnaissance
in
force
yesterday
which
resulted
in
obtaining
a
complete
view
of
the
enemy
position
a
negro
employed
in
jackson
tent
came
in
this
morning
and
reports
preparation
for
retreat
of
jackson
you
need
have
no
apprehensions
for
our
safety
i
think
we
are
just
now
in
a
condition
to
do
all
you
can
desire
of
us
in
the
valley
clear
the
enemy
out
permanently
on
the
when
ashby
repaid
with
interest
hatch
reconnaissance
in
force
he
reported
all
quiet
some
alarm
excited
by
movement
of
enemy
cavalry
it
appears
that
they
were
in
pursuit
of
a
union
prisoner
who
escaped
to
our
camp
the
day
he
left
jackson
was
to
be
reinforced
by
johnson
and
attack
via
luray
another
report
says
jackson
is
bound
for
richmond
this
is
the
fact
i
have
no
doubt
jackson
is
on
his
supplies
having
been
cut
off
by
our
advance
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
in
this
valley
this
side
of
strasburg
the
same
night
after
full
consultation
with
all
leading
officers
he
repeated
that
his
troops
were
no
longer
required
in
the
valley
and
suggested
to
the
secretary
of
war
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
cross
the
blue
ridge
and
clear
the
whole
country
north
of
gordonsville
enemy
force
there
is
far
less
than
represented
in
newspapers
not
more
than
at
the
outside
jackson
army
is
reduced
demoralised
on
they
are
all
concentrating
for
richmond
i
am
now
satisfied
that
it
is
the
most
safe
and
effective
disposition
for
our
corps
i
pray
your
favourable
consideration
such
order
will
electrify
our
force
the
force
was
certainly
to
be
electrified
but
the
impulse
was
not
to
come
from
secretary
stanton
banks
it
may
have
been
observed
whenever
his
superiors
wanted
him
to
move
had
invariably
the
best
of
reasons
for
halting
at
one
time
supplies
were
most
difficult
to
arrange
for
at
another
time
the
enemy
was
being
reinforced
and
his
own
numbers
were
small
but
when
he
was
told
to
halt
he
immediately
panted
to
be
let
loose
the
enemy
was
not
half
so
strong
as
had
been
reported
his
men
were
never
in
better
condition
supplies
were
plentiful
it
is
not
impossible
that
stanton
had
by
this
time
discovered
as
was
said
of
a
certain
confederate
general
a
protege
of
the
president
that
banks
had
a
fine
career
before
him
until
lincoln
undertook
to
make
of
him
what
the
good
lord
had
a
great
general
to
the
daring
propositions
of
the
late
governor
and
speaker
the
only
reply
vouchsafed
was
an
order
to
fall
back
on
strasburg
and
to
transfer
shields
division
to
general
mcdowell
at
fredericksburg
but
on
may
the
day
jackson
disappeared
behind
the
blue
ridge
banks
to
his
evident
discomfiture
found
that
his
adversary
had
not
retreated
to
richmond
after
all
the
dashing
commander
just
now
so
anxious
for
one
thing
or
the
other
either
to
clear
the
valley
or
to
sweep
the
country
north
of
gordonsville
disappeared
the
reduced
demoralised
enemy
assumed
alarming
proportions
nothing
was
said
about
his
and
as
ewell
had
reached
swift
run
gap
with
a
force
estimated
at
men
while
jackson
according
to
the
federal
scouts
was
still
near
port
republic
banks
thought
it
impossible
to
divide
his
force
with
safety
stanton
reply
is
not
on
record
but
it
seems
that
he
permitted
banks
to
retain
shields
until
he
arrived
at
strasburg
and
on
may
the
federals
fell
back
to
new
market
their
commander
misled
both
by
his
cavalry
and
his
spies
believing
that
jackson
had
marched
to
harrisonburg
on
the
the
day
that
jackson
moved
west
from
staunton
fears
again
revived
he
was
still
anxious
that
shields
should
remain
with
him
our
cavalry
he
said
from
near
harrisonburg
report
that
jackson
occupies
that
town
and
that
he
has
been
largely
reinforced
deserters
confirm
reports
of
jackson
movements
in
this
direction
jackson
movements
at
this
juncture
are
full
of
interest
friend
and
foe
were
both
mystified
even
his
own
officers
might
well
ask
why
in
his
march
to
staunton
he
deliberately
adopted
the
terrible
road
to
port
republic
from
elk
run
valley
a
metalled
road
passed
over
the
blue
ridge
to
gordonsville
staunton
by
this
route
was
miles
further
than
by
port
republic
but
there
were
no
obstacles
to
rapid
marching
and
the
command
would
have
arrived
no
later
than
it
actually
did
moreover
in
moving
to
port
republic
eleven
miles
only
from
harrisonburg
and
within
sight
of
the
enemy
patrols
it
would
seem
that
there
was
considerable
risk
had
banks
attacked
the
bridge
whilst
the
confederate
artillery
was
dragging
heavily
through
the
mire
the
consequences
would
probably
have
been
unpleasant
even
if
he
had
not
carried
the
bridge
the
road
which
jackson
had
chosen
ran
for
several
miles
over
the
open
plain
which
lies
eastward
of
the
shenandoah
and
from
the
commanding
bluffs
on
the
western
bank
his
column
could
have
been
effectively
shelled
without
the
power
of
reply
in
moving
to
staunton
the
confederate
commander
had
three
objects
in
view
to
strengthen
his
own
force
by
combining
with
edward
johnson
to
prevent
the
federals
combining
by
keeping
banks
stationary
and
defeating
milroy
to
protect
staunton
the
real
danger
that
he
had
to
guard
against
was
that
banks
taking
advantage
of
his
absence
from
the
valley
should
move
on
staunton
knowing
his
adversary
as
well
as
he
did
he
had
no
reason
to
apprehend
attack
during
his
march
to
port
republic
but
it
was
not
impossible
that
when
he
found
out
that
jackson
had
vanished
from
the
valley
banks
might
take
heart
and
join
hands
with
milroy
it
was
necessary
therefore
in
order
to
prevent
banks
moving
that
jackson
absence
from
the
valley
should
be
very
short
also
in
order
to
prevent
milroy
either
joining
banks
or
taking
staunton
that
edward
johnson
should
be
reinforced
as
rapidly
as
possible
these
objects
would
be
attained
by
making
use
of
the
road
to
port
republic
in
the
first
place
banks
would
not
dare
to
move
towards
milroy
so
long
as
the
flank
of
his
line
of
march
was
threatened
and
in
the
second
place
from
port
republic
to
staunton
by
river
was
little
more
than
two
days
march
within
hours
therefore
using
the
railway
it
would
be
possible
to
strengthen
johnson
in
time
to
protect
staunton
and
to
prevent
the
federals
uniting
it
was
unlikely
that
banks
even
if
he
heard
at
once
that
his
enemy
had
vanished
would
immediately
dash
forward
and
even
if
he
did
he
would
still
have
miles
to
march
before
he
reached
staunton
every
precaution
had
been
taken
too
that
he
should
not
hear
of
the
movement
across
the
blue
ridge
till
it
was
too
late
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
as
we
have
already
seen
so
late
as
may
he
believed
that
jackson
was
at
harrisonburg
ashby
had
done
his
work
well
it
might
be
argued
however
that
with
an
antagonist
so
supine
as
banks
jackson
might
have
openly
marched
to
staunton
by
the
most
direct
route
in
fact
that
he
need
never
have
left
the
valley
at
all
but
had
he
taken
the
road
across
the
valley
he
would
have
advertised
his
purpose
milroy
would
have
received
long
warning
of
his
approach
and
all
chance
of
effecting
a
surprise
would
have
been
lost
on
april
the
day
on
which
jackson
began
his
movement
richmond
was
still
safe
the
yorktown
lines
were
intact
held
by
the
confederates
under
johnston
but
it
was
very
evident
that
they
could
not
be
long
maintained
a
large
siege
train
had
been
brought
from
washington
and
johnston
had
already
learned
that
in
a
few
days
one
hundred
pieces
of
the
heaviest
ordnance
would
open
fire
on
his
position
his
own
armament
was
altogether
inadequate
to
cope
with
such
ponderous
metal
his
strength
was
not
half
his
adversary
and
he
had
determined
to
retreat
without
waiting
to
have
his
works
demolished
but
the
mighty
army
in
his
front
was
not
the
only
danger
mcdowell
with
men
had
already
concentrated
near
falmouth
johnston
in
falling
back
on
richmond
was
in
danger
of
being
caught
between
two
fires
for
to
oppose
mcdowell
on
the
rappahannock
lee
had
been
unable
to
assemble
more
than
confederates
these
facts
were
all
known
to
jackson
whether
the
march
to
river
was
intended
by
him
to
have
any
further
effect
on
the
federals
than
surprising
milroy
and
clearing
the
way
for
an
attack
on
banks
it
is
impossible
to
say
it
is
indisputable
at
the
same
time
that
his
sudden
disappearance
from
the
valley
disturbed
stanton
the
secretary
of
war
had
suspected
that
jackson
occupation
of
swift
run
gap
meant
mischief
mcdowell
who
had
been
instructed
to
cross
the
rappahannock
was
ordered
in
consequence
to
stand
fast
at
falmouth
and
was
warned
that
the
enemy
amusing
mcclellan
at
yorktown
might
make
a
sudden
dash
on
either
himself
or
banks
a
few
days
later
mcdowell
reported
that
jackson
had
passed
gordonsville
the
news
came
from
deserters
very
intelligent
men
the
next
day
he
was
informed
that
shields
was
to
be
transferred
to
his
command
and
that
he
was
to
bear
in
mind
his
instructions
as
to
the
defence
of
washington
banks
had
already
been
ordered
back
to
strasburg
now
a
few
days
previously
stanton
had
been
talking
of
between
mcclellan
and
mcdowell
directly
he
learned
that
jackson
was
east
of
the
blue
ridge
all
thought
of
combination
was
abandoned
mcdowell
was
held
back
shields
was
sent
to
reinforce
him
and
the
possible
danger
to
washington
overrode
all
other
considerations
the
weak
point
of
mcclellan
strategy
was
making
itself
felt
in
advancing
on
richmond
by
way
of
the
peninsula
he
had
deliberately
adopted
what
are
called
in
strategy
the
exterior
lines
that
is
his
forces
were
distributed
on
the
arc
of
a
circle
of
which
richmond
and
the
confederate
army
were
the
centre
if
landing
on
the
peninsula
he
had
been
able
to
advance
at
once
upon
richmond
the
enemy
must
have
concentrated
for
the
defence
of
his
capital
and
neither
banks
nor
washington
would
have
been
disturbed
but
the
moment
his
advance
was
checked
as
it
was
at
yorktown
the
enemy
could
detach
at
his
leisure
in
any
direction
that
he
pleased
and
mcclellan
was
absolutely
unable
to
support
the
threatened
point
the
strategy
of
exterior
lines
demands
for
success
a
strong
and
continuous
pressure
on
the
enemy
main
army
depriving
him
of
the
time
and
the
space
necessary
for
counterstroke
if
this
is
impossible
a
skilful
foe
will
at
once
make
use
of
his
central
position
lincoln
appears
to
have
had
an
instinctive
apprehension
that
mcclellan
might
not
be
able
to
exert
sufficient
pressure
to
hold
johnston
fast
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
had
fought
so
strongly
against
the
peninsula
line
of
invasion
it
was
the
probability
that
the
confederates
would
use
their
opportunity
with
which
stanton
had
now
to
deal
complicated
by
the
fact
that
their
numbers
were
believed
to
be
much
greater
than
they
really
were
still
the
problem
was
not
one
of
insurmountable
difficulty
banks
and
fremont
united
had
men
mcdowell
over
a
few
marches
would
have
brought
these
forces
into
combination
banks
and
fremont
occupying
staunton
and
moving
on
gordonsville
would
have
soon
taken
up
communication
with
mcdowell
an
army
strong
far
larger
than
any
force
the
confederates
could
detach
against
it
would
have
threatened
richmond
from
the
north
and
west
and
at
the
same
time
would
have
covered
washington
this
plan
though
not
without
elements
of
danger
offered
some
advantages
nor
were
soldiers
wanting
to
advise
it
both
rosecrans
and
shields
had
submitted
schemes
for
such
a
combination
stanton
however
preferred
to
control
the
chessboard
by
the
light
of
unaided
wisdom
and
while
mcdowell
was
unnecessarily
strengthened
both
banks
and
fremont
were
dangerously
weakened
the
only
single
point
where
the
secretary
showed
the
slightest
sagacity
was
in
apprehending
that
the
confederates
would
make
use
of
their
opportunity
and
overwhelm
one
of
the
detachments
he
had
so
ingeniously
isolated
on
april
johnston
proposed
to
davis
that
his
army
should
be
withdrawn
from
the

that
the
north
should
be
invaded

lee
in
the
name
of
the
president
replied
that
some
such
scheme
had
been
for
some
time
under
consideration
and
the
burden
of
his
letters
as
we
have
seen
both
to
ewell
and
jackson
was
that
a
sudden
and
heavy
blow
should
be
struck
at
some
exposed
portion
of
the
invading
armies
stanton
was
so
far
right
but
where
the
blow
was
to
be
struck
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
divine
it
is
believed
he
writes
to
the
assistant

considerable

has
been

prove
the

the

the

have

compelled
to
retire

it
was
by
no
means
easy
however
to
prevent
them
from
getting
away
unscathed
but
jackson
was
not
the
man
to
leave
the
task
untried
and
to
content
himself
with
a
mere
cannonade
he
had
reason
to
hope
that
milroy
was
ignorant
of
his
junction
with
general
johnson
and
that
he
would
suppose
he
had
only
the
six
regiments
of
the
latter
with
which
to
deal
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
valley
brigades
toiling
through
the
mountains
were
still
some
miles
behind
he
proposed
therefore
while
his
staff
explored
the
mountains
for
a
track
which
might
lead
him
the
next
day
to
the
rear
of
the
federal
position
merely
to
hold
his
ground
on

his
immediate
opponent
however
was
a
general
of
more
resource
and
energy
than
banks
milroy
was
at
least
able
to
supply
himself
with
information
on

he
had
been
advised
by
his
scouts

spies
that
jackson
and
johnson
had
combined

that
they
were
advancing

in

advanced
in

strong
line
of

up

had
observed

they
believed
to
be

their

exposure
endeavoured
again

again
to
withdraw

amidst
the

of

musketry
his
voice
was
lifted
up
in
vain
and
when
by
passing
along

he
persuaded

these

great
was
the

jackson
in

up

a
narrow
steep
ravine
wooded

filled

forbade

says

the
roar
of
the
struggle
had
passed
away
and
the
green
reposed
under
the
starlight
as
calmly
as
when
it
had
been
occupied
only
by
its
peaceful
herds
detachments
of
soldiers
were
silently
exploring
the
ground
for
their
wounded
comrades
while
the
tired
troops
were
slowly
filing
off
to
their
bivouac
at
midnight
the
last
sufferer
had
been
removed
and
the
last
picket
posted
and
then
only
did
jackson
turn
to
seek
a
few
hours
repose
in
a
neighbouring
farmhouse
the
valley
of
lay
in
equal
quiet
the
of
the
federals
blazed
ostentatiously
in
long
and
regular
lines
and
their
troops
seemed
wrapped
in
sleep
at
one
the
general
reached
his
quarters
and
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
when
his
mulatto
servant
knowing
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
morning
came
in
with
food
he
said
want
none
nothing
but
sleep
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
slumbering
like
a
healthy
child
it
seems
however
that
the
march
of
the
turning
column
had
already
been
countermanded
putting
himself
in
his
enemy
place
jackson
had
foreseen
milroy
movements
if
the
one
could
move
by
night
so
could
the
other
and
when
he
rode
out
at
dawn
the
federals
as
he
anticipated
had
disappeared
the
next
day
he
sent
a
laconic
despatch
to
richmond
god
blessed
our
arms
with
victory
at
yesterday
this
announcement
was
doubtless
received
by
the
people
of
virginia
as
dabney
declares
with
peculiar
delight
on
may
johnston
had
evacuated
yorktown
on
the
he
had
checked
the
pursuit
at
williamsburg
inflicting
heavy
losses
but
had
continued
his
retreat
on
the
norfolk
was
abandoned
and
on
the
the
merrimac
grounding
in
the
james
was
destroyed
by
her
commander
the
victory
of
was
the
one
gleam
of
brightness
athwart
all
these
clouds
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
the
victory
was
insignificant
the
repulse
of
men
by
was
not
a
remarkable
feat
and
it
would
even
appear
that
might
be
ranked
with
the
battles
of
lost
opportunities
a
vigorous
counterstroke
would
probably
have
destroyed
the
whole
of
the
attacking
force
the
riflemen
of
the
west
however
were
not
made
of
the
stuff
that
yields
readily
to
superior
force
the
fight
for
the
bridge
would
have
been
fierce
and
bloody
twilight
had
fallen
before
the
confederate
reinforcements
arrived
upon
the
scene
and
under
such
conditions
the
losses
must
have
been
very
heavy
but
to
lose
men
was
exactly
what
jackson
wished
to
avoid
the
object
of
his
manoeuvres
was
the
destruction
not
of
fremont
advanced
guard
but
of
banks
army
and
if
his
numbers
were
seriously
reduced
it
would
be
impossible
to
attain
that
end
fremont
brigades
moreover
protected
no
vital
point
a
decisive
victory
at
would
have
produced
but
little
effect
at
washington
no
great
results
were
to
be
expected
from
operations
in
so
distant
a
section
of
the
strategic
theatre
and
jackson
aimed
at
nothing
more
than
driving
the
enemy
so
far
back
as
to
isolate
him
from
banks
may
the
next
morning
the
small
force
of
cavalry
crossed
the
bridge
and
rode
cautiously
through
the
mountain
passes
the
infantry
halted
for
some
hours
in
in
order
that
rations
might
be
issued
but
the
federals
made
miles
and
were
already
too
far
ahead
to
be
overtaken
on
the
and
the
the
confederates
made
forced
marches
but
the
enemy
set
fire
to
the
forests
on
the
and
this
desperate
measure
proved
eminently
successful
the
sky
was
overcast
with
volumes
of
smoke
which
wrapped
every
distant
object
in
a
veil
impenetrable
alike
to
the
eyes
and
telescopes
of
the
officers
through
this
sultry
canopy
the
pursuing
army
felt
its
way
cautiously
cannonaded
by
the
enemy
from
every
advantageous
position
while
it
was
protected
from
ambuscades
only
by
detachments
of
skirmishers
who
scoured
the
burning
woods
on
either
side
of
the
highway
the
general
often
far
in
advance
of
the
column
in
his
eagerness
to
overtake
the
foe
declared
that
this
was
the
most
adroit
expedient
to
which
a
retreating
army
could
resort
and
that
it
entailed
upon
him
all
the
disadvantages
of
a
night
attack
by
slow
approaches
and
with
constant
skirmishing
the
federals
were
driven
back
to
franklin
village
and
the
double
darkness
of
the
night

menaced
by

its
numbers
so
black
was
the
situation
that
military
stores
had
already
been
removed
from
the
capital
the
archives
of
the
confederacy
had
been
packed
and
davis
had
made
arrangements
for
the
departure
of
his
family
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
virginia
people
the
government
had
decided
to
abandon
richmond
the
general
assembly
addressed
a
resolution
to
the

requiring
him
to
defend
the

if
necessary
until
not
a
stone
was
left
upon
another
the

council
enthusiastically
supported
by

a

rode

slow

was
time
to

made
a
mighty
effort

six

below

might
be
seen
senators
and

digging
parapets
and
hauling
timber
in
company
with

of

heavy
guns
were
mounted
a
great
boom
was
constructed
across

when
the

approached
they
were
easily
driven
back
and
men
once
more
breathed
freely
in
the
streets
of
richmond
the
example
of
the
unterrified
commonwealth
as
virginia
has
been
proudly
named
inspired
the
government
and
it
was
determined
come
what
might
that
richmond
should
be
held
on
the
land
side
it
was
already
fortified
but
lee
was
unwilling
to
resign
himself
to
a
siege
mcclellan
had
still
to
cross
the
chickahominy
a
stream
which
oozes
by
many
channels
through
treacherous
swamps
and
an
unwholesome
jungle
and
despite
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
the
invading
armies
it
was
still
possible
to
strike
an
effective
blow
few
would
have
seen
the
opportunity
or
with
a
great
army
thundering
at
the
gates
of
richmond
have
dared
to
seize
it
but
it
was
not
mcclellan
and
mcdowell
whom
lee
was
fighting
not
the
enormous
hosts
which
they
commanded
nor
the
vast
resources
of
the
north
the
power
which
gave
life
and
motion
to
the
mighty
mechanism
of
the
attack
lay
not
within
the
camps
that
could
be
seen
from
the
housetops
of
richmond
and
from
the
hills

fredericksburg

away

the
mainspring
of
the

strength
the
multitudes
of
armed
men
that
overran
virginia
were
no
more
the
inanimate
pieces
of
the
the
power
which
controlled
them
was
the
northern
president
it
was
at
lincoln
that
lee
was
about
to
strike
at
lincoln
and
the
northern
people
and
an
effective
blow
at
the
point
which
people
and
president
deemed
vital
might
arrest
the
progress
of
their
armies
as
surely
as
if
the
confederates
had
been
reinforced
by
a
hundred
thousand
men
may
on
may
lee
wrote
to
jackson
whatever
movement
you
make
against
banks
do
it
speedily
and
if
successful
drive
him
back
towards
the
potomac
and
create
the
impression
as
far
as
possible
that
you
design
threatening
that
line
for
this
purpose
in
addition
to
ewell
and
johnson
forces
the
army
of
the
valley
was
to
be
reinforced
by
two
brigades
branch
and
mahone
of
which
the
former
had
already
reached
gordonsville
in
this
letter
the
idea
of
playing
on
the
fears
of
lincoln
for
the
safety
of
his
capital
first
sees
the
light
and
it
is
undoubtedly
to
be
attributed
to
the
brain
of
lee
that
the
same
idea
had
been
uppermost
in
jackson
mind
during
the
whole
course
of
the
campaign
is
proved
not
only
by
the
evidence
of
his
chief
of
the
staff
but
by
his
correspondence
with
headquarters
if
banks
is
defeated
he
had
written
on
april
it
may
directly
retard
mcclellan
movements
it
is
true
that
nowhere
in
his
correspondence
is
the
idea
of
menacing
washington
directly
mentioned
nor
is
there
the
slightest
evidence
that
he
suggested
it
to
lee
but
in
his
letters
to
his
superiors
he
confines
himself
strictly
to
the
immediate
subject
and
on
no
single
occasion
does
he
indulge
in
speculation
on
possible
results
in
the
ability
of
the
he
had
the
most
implicit
confidence
lee
he
said
is
the
only
man
i
know
whom
i
would
follow
blindfold
and
he
was
doubtless
assured
that
the
embarrassments
of
the
federal
government
were
as
apparent
to
lee
as
to
himself
that
the
same
idea
should
have
suggested
itself
independently
to
both
is
hardly
strange
both
looked
further
than
the
enemy
camps
both
studied
the
situation
in
its
broadest
bearings
both
understood
the
importance
of
introducing
a
disturbing
element
into
the
enemy
plans
and
both
were
aware
that
the
surest
means
of
winning
battles
is
to
upset
the
mental
equilibrium
of
the
opposing
leader
before
he
reached
mount
solon
jackson
had
instructed
ewell
to
call
up
branch
brigade
from
gordonsville
he
intended
to
follow
banks
with
the
whole
force
at
his
disposal
and
in
these
dispositions
lee
had
acquiesced
johnston
however
now
at
richmond
had
once
more
resumed
charge
of
the
detached
forces
and
a
good
deal
of
confusion
ensued
lee
intent
on
threatening
washington
was
of
opinion
that
banks
should
be
attacked
johnston
although
at
first
he
favoured
such
a
movement
does
not
appear
to
have
realised
the
effect
that
might
be
produced
by
an
advance
to
the
potomac
information
had
been
received
that
banks
was
constructing
intrenchments
at
strasburg
and
johnston
changed
his
mind
he
thought
the
attack
too
hazardous
and
ewell
was
directed
to
cross
the
blue
ridge
and
march
eastward
while
jackson
observed
banks
these
orders
placed
ewell
in
a
dilemma
under
instructions

two
days

which

troops
had
fallen
at
a
useful
time
they
had
marches
to
look
back
on
which
had
tried
their
endurance
to
the
utmost
in
three
days
before
and
after
kernstown
they
had
covered
miles
and
had
fought
a
severe
engagement
the
struggle
with
the
mud
on
the
port
republic
was
only
surpassed
by
the
hardships
of
the
march
to
romney
from
elk
run
to
franklin
and
from
franklin
to
mount
solon
is
just
two
hundred
miles
and
these
they
had
traversed
in
eighteen
days
but
the
exertions
which
had
been
then
demanded
from
them
were
trifling
in

with

which
were
to
come
from

to

is
eighty
miles
by
the
valley
pike
to
harper
ferry
one
hundred

jackson
had
determined
that
before
many
days
had
passed
the
confederate
colours
should
be
carried
in
triumph
through
the
streets
of
winchester

that
the

should

johnston
believed
that

earthworks

sheltered
jackson
saw
that
his
enemy
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
and
that
his
earthworks
skilfully
and
strongly
constructed
as
they
were
were
no
more

jackson

by
his
eccentricity
bright
prominent
eyes
a
bald
head

a
nose
like
that
of
francis

him
a
striking
resemblance
to

woodcock
and
this
was
increased
by
a
habit
of
putting
his
head
on
one
side
to
utter
his
quaint
speeches
he
fancied
that
he
had
some
mysterious
internal
malady
and
would
eat
nothing

frumenty
a
preparation
of
wheat

his
plaintive

halting

prevent

important
personage
at

to
have
been
alone

his
apprehension
that
a
storm
was
gathering
in
the
summer
sky
the
aspect
of
affairs
in

wrote
to

threatening

the
secretary
however
saw
no
reason
for
alarm
his
strategical
combinations
were
apparently
working
without
a
hitch

in
a
strong
position

about
to
lend

aid

storm

cox
a

able
officer

making

progress
towards

virginia

certainly
been
compelled
to
halt

milroy
was
driven
back
to
franklin
yet
the
defeated
troops
were
rapidly
reorganising

fremont
would
soon
resume
his
movement
milroy
defeat
was
considered
no
more
than
an
incident
of

petite

washington
seemed
so
perfectly
secure
that
the
recruiting
offices
had
been
closed

the

anticipating

immediate
fall

left

was
to

grand
review

had
marched
to

reducing
his
force
by
a
half
believed
that
there
was
no
immediate
reason
to
fear
attack
i
regard
it
as
certain
he
wrote
that
jackson
will
move
north
as
far
as
new
market
a
position
which
enables
him
to
cooperate
with
general
ewell
who
is
still
at
swift
run
gap
yet
he
took
occasion
to
remind
stanton
of
the
persistent
adherence
of
jackson
to
the
defence
of
the
valley
and
his
purpose
to
expel
the
government
troops
this
he
added
may
be
assumed
as
certain
there
is
probably
no
one
more
fixed
and
determined
purpose
in
the
whole
circle
of
the
enemy
plans
banks
had
certainly
learned
something
of
jackson
by
this
time
but
he
did
not
yet
know
all
so
on
this
night
of
may
the
president
and
his
people
were
without
fear
of
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
the
end
of
the
rebellion
seemed
near
at
hand
washington
was
full
of
the
anticipated
triumph
the
crowds
passed
to
and
fro
in
the
broad
avenues
exchanging
congratulations
on
the
success
of
the
northern
arms
and
the
approaching
downfall
of
the
slaveholders
the
theatres
were
filled
with
delighted
audiences
who
hailed
every
scoffing
allusion
to
the
southern
chivalry
with
enthusiasm
and
gaiety
and
confidence
reigned
supreme
little
dreamt
the
multitude
that
in
the
silent
woods
of
the
luray
valley
a
confederate
army
lay
asleep
beneath
the
stars
little
dreamt
lincoln
or

or
stanton
that
not
more
than
seventy
miles
from
washington
and
less
than
thirty
from
strasburg
the
most
daring
of
their
enemies
waiting
for
the
dawn
to
rise
above

pouring
out
his
soul
in
prayer
appealing
from

forth

amen
that
stonewall

it
is
not
always
joy
that
cometh
in
the
morning
least
of
all
to
generals
as
ignorant
as
banks
when
they
have
to
do
with
a
skilful
foe
it
was
not
altogether
banks
fault
that
his
position
was
a
bad
one
stanton
had
given
him
a
direct
order
to
take
post
at
strasburg
or
its
vicinity
and
to
send
two
regiments
to
hold
the
bridges
at
front
royal
but
banks
had
made
no
remonstrance
he
had
either
failed
to
recognise
until
it
was
too
late
that
the
force
at
front
royal
would
be
exposed
to
attack
from
the
luray
valley
and
if
the
post
fell
that
his
own
communications
with
both
winchester
and
washington
would
be
at
once
endangered
or
he
had
lost
favour
with
the
secretary
for
some
time
past
stanton
telegrams
had
been
cold
and
peremptory
there
had
been
no
more
effusive
praise
of
cautious
vigour
and
interesting
manoeuvres
and
banks
had
gradually
fallen
from
the
command
of
a
large
army

to
the
charge
of
a

his

thus
distributed

pitched
his

two

were
on

beyond
the
houses
in

were
the
dense
forests
which
fill
the
luray
valley
and
cover
the
foothills
of
the
mountains
and
the
view
of
the
federal

was
very
limited
a
strong
patrol
of
infantry

troopers
which
had
been
sent
out
on

marched
eleven
miles
south
had
bivouacked
in

had
captured
a
confederate
straggler
the
officer

had
obtained
information
by
questioning
civilians
that
confederate
infantry
was
expected
and
this
was
confirmed
by
his
prisoner
banks
however
notwithstanding
this
report
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
an
attack
was
imminent
and
the

reason

been
unable
to

of

was
practically
dependent
on
the
vigilance
of
his
sentries
may
on
the
morning
of
may
there
was
no
token
of
the
approaching
storm
the
day
was
intensely
hot
and
the
blue
masses
of
the
mountains
shimmered
in
the
summer
haze
in
the
luray
valley
to
the
south
was
no
sign
of
life
save
the
buzzards
sailing
lazily
above
the
slumbrous
woods
suddenly
and
without
the
least
warning
a
long
line
of
skirmishers
broke
forward
from
the
forest
the
clear
notes
of
the
confederate
bugles
succeeded
by
the
crash
of
musketry
woke
the
echoes
of
the
blue
ridge
and
the
federal
pickets
were
driven
in
confusion
through
the
village
the
long
roll
of
the
drums
beat
the
startled
camp
to
arms
and
kenly
hastily
drew
up
his
slender
force
upon
a
ridge
in
rear
the
ground
in
front
of
his
position
was
fairly
open
and
with
his
two
pieces
of
artillery
he
was
able
to
check
the
first
rush
of
the
confederate
infantry
the
guns
which
had
accompanied
their
advanced
guard
were
only
and
it
was
some
time
before
a
battery
capable
of
making
effective
reply
to
the
federal
pieces
was
brought
up
as
soon
as
it
opened
fire
the
southern
infantry
was
ordered
to
attack
and
while
one
regiment
working
round
through
the
woods
on
the
enemy
left
endeavoured
to
outflank
his
guns
four
others
in
successive
lines
advanced
across
the
plain
against
his
front
the
federals
undismayed
by
the
disparity
of
numbers
were
fighting
bravely
and
had
just
been
reinforced
by
a
squadron
of
new
york
regiment
when
word
was
brought
to
their
commander
that
a
regiment
of
southern
cavalry
had
appeared
between
the
rivers
to
his
right
rear
he
at
once
gave
the
order
to
retire
the
movement
was
carried
out
in
good
order
under
heavy
musketry
and
the
tents
and
stores
were
given
to
the
flames
but
an
attempt
to
fire
the
bridges
failed
for
the
louisiana
infantry
rushing
recklessly
forward
darted
into
the
flames
and
extinguished
the
burning
brands
sufficient
damage
was
done
however
to
render
the
passage
of
the
north
fork
by
the
confederates
slow
and
difficult
and
kenly
took
post
on
guard
hill
a
commanding
ridge
beyond
the
stream
again
there
was
delay
the
smoke
of
the
burning
camp
rolling
past
in
dense
volumes
formed
an
impenetrable
screen
the
river
was
deep
and
turbulent
with
a
strong
current
and
the
federal
guns
commanded
the
single
bridge
the
cavalry
however
were
not
long
in
discovering
a
practicable
ford
the
river
was
soon
alive
with
horsemen
and
forcing
their
way
through
the
swirling
waters
four
squadrons
of
the
virginia
accompanied
by
jackson
gained
the
further
bank
and
formed
up
rapidly
for
pursuit
the
enemy
had
already
retired
and
the
dust
of
the
retreating
column
warn
receding
fast
down
the
road
to
winchester
without
waiting
for
reinforcements
and
without
artillery
jackson
urged
the
virginia
forward
the
country
through
which
the
turnpike
runs
is
rolling
and
and
the
rail
fences
on
either
hand
made
movement
across
the
fields
by
no
means
easy
but
the
confederate
advance
was
vigorous
the
new
york
cavalry
pressed
at
every
point
were
beginning
to
waver
and
near
the
little
hamlet
of
cedarville
some
three
miles
from
his
last
position
kenly
gave
orders
for
his
infantry
to
check
the
pursuit
the
column
had
halted
men
were
tearing
down
the
fences
and
the
companies
were
forming
for
battle
in
the
fields
when
there
was
a
sudden
outcry
the
rolling
thunder
of
many
hoofs
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
a
dense
cloud
of
dust
came
whirling
down
the
turnpike
and
emerging
from
the
yellow
canopy
the
new
york
troopers
riding
for
their
lives
dashed
through
the
ranks
of
the
startled
infantry
while
the
confederate
horsemen
extending
far
to
right
and
left
came
surging
on
their
traces
the
leading
squadron
keeping
to
the
high
road
was
formed
four
abreast
and
the
deep
mass
was
wedged
tightly
between
the
fences
the
foremost
files
were
mowed
down
by
a
volley
at
close
range
and
here
for
a
moment
the
attack
was
checked
but
the
virginians
meant
riding
home
on
either
flank
the
supporting
squadrons
galloped
swiftly
forward
and
up
the
road
and
across
the
fields
while
the
earth
shook
beneath
their
tread
swept
their
charging
lines
the
men
yelling
in
their
excitement
and
horses
as
frenzied
as
their
riders
in
vain
the
federal
officers
tried
to
deploy
their
companies
kenly
calling
on
them
to
rally
round
the
colours
was
cut
down
with
a
dreadful
wound
the
grey
troopers
fell
on
them
before
they
could
fix
bayonets
or
form
a
front
and
sabre
and
revolver
found
an
easy
mark
in
the
crowded
masses
of
infantry
one
of
the
guns
was
surrounded
and
the
gunners
were
cut
to
pieces
the
other
escaped
for
the
moment
but
was
soon
abandoned
and
with
the
appearance
of
a
fresh
confederate
squadron
on
the
scene
kenly
whole
force
dispersed
in
flight
through
woods
and
orchards
the
chase
went
on
escape
was
impossible
hundreds
laid
down
their
arms
and
virginia
horsemen
resolutely
handled
and
charging
at
exactly
the
right
moment
had
the
honour
of
bringing
in
as
prisoners
federals
including
officers
and
a
complete
section
of
artillery
the
enemy
lost
in
addition
killed
and
wounded
the
confederate
casualties
were
killed
and
wounded
and
so
sudden
and
vigorous
was
their
attack
that
a
federal
colonel
estimated
their
numbers
at
colonel
flournoy
a
most
daring
officer
led
the
squadrons
to
the
charge
but
that
the
opportunity
was
so
instantly
utilised
was
due
to
jackson
no
sooner
says
dabney
did
he
see
the
enemy
than
he
gave
the
order
to
charge
with
a
voice
and
air
whose
peremptory
determination
was
communicated
to
the
whole
party
his
quick
eye
estimated
aright
the
discouragement
of
the
federals
and
their
wavering
temper
infusing
his
own
spirit
into
his
men
he
struck
the
hesitating
foe
at
the
decisive
moment
and
shattered
them
dabney
volume

yet
he
took
no
credit
to
himself
he
declared
afterwards
to
his
staff
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
experience
of
warfare
seen
so
gallant
and
effective
a
charge
of
cavalry
and
such
commendation
coming
from
his
guarded
lips
was
the
highest
honour
that
his
troopers
could
have
wished
while
these
events
were
in
progress
the
remainder
of
the
confederate
cavalry
had
also
been
busy
the
virginia

moved
to
buckton
the
railway
was
torn
up
the
telegraph
line
cut
and
an
urgent
message
to

was
intercepted
the

two
of

drove

two
locomotives
were
standing
on
the

by
this

the
federals
attempted
to
escape

they
moved

they
were

in
the
early

about
three
and
a
half
miles
south
of
the

outpost
line
he
had
turned
to
the
right
off
the
luray
road
and
plunging
into
the
woods
had
approached
front
royal
by
a
circuitous
track
so
rough
that
the
enemy
had
thought
it
hardly
worth
while
to
watch
it
the
main
body
of
the
cavalry
left
the
luray
road
at
ford
and
crossing
the
south
fork
of

shenandoah
worked
through

withdrawn

with
the
exception
of

kenly
retreated

meanwhile
another

had
cut
the

between

and
a
strong
detachment
scouring
the
country
east
of
the
blue
ridge
checked

and
blocked
the
entrance
to
the
gap
from
the
direction
of
manassas
within
an
hour
after
his
pickets
were
surprised
kenly
was
completely
isolated
the
ingenuous
report
of
a
federal
officer
engaged
at
front
royal
is
significant
of
the
effect
of
the
sudden
attack
of
the
confederates
he
was
sick
at
the
time
but
managed
to
escape
by
considerable
coaxing
he
wrote
i
obtained
an
entrance
to
a
house
near
by
i
was
now
completely
broken
down
so
much
so
that
the
gentleman
prepared
a
liniment
for
me
and
actually
bound
up
some
of
my
bruises
while
the
female
portion
of
the
household
actually
screamed
for
joy
at
our
defeat
i
was
helped
to
bed
and
next
morning
was
taken
by
bitzer
to
winchester
in
his
carriage
he
is
a
gentleman
in
all
particulars
but
his
family
is
the
reverse
sic
on
reaching
winchester
i
found
things
decidedly
squally
and
concluded
to
get
out
i
was
carried
to
martinsburg
and
being
offered
by
the
agent
of
a
luggage
train
to
take
me
to
baltimore
i
concluded
to
accept
the
offer
and
took
a
sleeping
bunk
arriving
in
baltimore
the
next
afternoon
he
then
proceeded
to
philadelphia
and
sent
for
his
physician
several
of
his
officers
whom
he
found
in
the
town
he
immediately
sent
back
to
the
colours
but
as
he
believed
that
the
morale
of
his
regiment
was
not
as
it
should
be
he
remained
himself
in
philadelphia
a
failure
in
staff
duties
marred
to
some
extent
the
confederate
success
a
vicious
usage
according
to
dabney
obtained
at
this
time
in
the
southern
armies
this
was
the
custom
of
temporarily
attaching
to
the
staff
of
a
general
commanding
a
division
or
an
army
a
company
of
cavalry
to
do
the
work
of
orderlies
by
this
clumsy
contrivance
the
organisation
of
the
cavalry
regiments
was
broken
up
the
men
detached
were
deprived
of
all
opportunity
for
drill
and
the
general
had
no
evidence
whatever
of
their
special
fitness
for
the
responsible
service
confided
to
them
nay
the
colonel
of
cavalry
required
to
furnish
them
was
most
likely
to
select
the
least
serviceable
company
at
the
time
of
the
combat
of
front
royal
the
duty
of
orderlies
was
performed
for
general
jackson
by
a
detachment
from
one
of
ashby
undisciplined
companies
of
whom
many
were
raw
youths
just
recruited
and
never
under
fire
as
soon
as
the
federal
pickets
were
driven
in
orders
were
despatched
to
the
rear
brigades
to
avoid
the
laborious
route
taken
by
the
advance
and
to
pursue
the
direct
highway
to
the
town
a
level
track
of
three
miles
in
place
of
a
steep
byway
of
seven
or
eight
the
boy
by
whom
the
orders
were
sent
was
seen
no
more
when
jackson
sent
orders
to
the
artillery
and
rear
brigades
to
hurry
the
pursuit
instead
of
being
found
near
at
hand
upon
the
direct
road
they
were
at
length
overtaken
toiling
over
the
hills
of
the
useless
circuit
spent
with
the
protracted
march
thus
night
overtook
them
by
the
time
they
reached
the
village
this
unfortunate
incident
taught
the
necessity
of
a
picked
company
of
orderlies
selected
for
their
intelligence
and
courage
permanently
attached
to
headquarters
and
owing
no
subordination
to
any
other
than
the
general
and
his
staff
such
was
the
usage
that
afterwards
prevailed
in
the
confederate
armies
dabney
volume
pages
and
it
may
be
recalled
that
wellington
found
it
necessary
to
form
a
corps
of
the
same
kind
in
the
peninsular
war
it
is
curious
that
no
such
organisation
exists
in
regular
armies
general
gordon
has
described
with
much
minuteness
how
the
news
of
the
disaster
was
received
at
strasburg
the
attack
had
begun
at
one
but
it
was
not
till
four
that
banks
was
made
aware
that
his
detachment
was
in
jeopardy
believing
that
jackson
was
at
harrisonburg
sixty
miles
distant
he
had
certainly
no
cause
for
immediate
apprehension
the
valley
towards
woodstock
never
looked
more
peaceful
than
on
that
sleepy
summer
afternoon
the
sentries
dawdled
on
their
posts
and
officers
and
men
alike
resigned
themselves
to
its
restful
influence
suddenly
a
mounted
orderly
dashed
violently
through
the
camp
and
strasburg
was
aroused
by
the
road
to
buckton
banks
hastily
despatched
a
regiment
and
two
guns
then
came
a
lull
and
many
anxious
inquiries
what
is
it
is
it
stonewall
jackson
or
only
a
cavalry
raid
a
few
hours
later
reports
came
in
from
the
field
of
battle
and
banks
telegraphed
to
stanton
that
rebels
had
driven
kenly
back
on
middletown
the
force
he
added
has
been
gathering
in
the
mountains
it
is
said
since
wednesday
but
still
the
federal
general
showed
no
undue
alarm
nothing
was
done
says
gordon
towards
sending
away
to
winchester
any
of
the
immense
quantities
of
public
stores
collected
at
strasburg
no
movement
had
been
made
to
place
our
sick
in
safety
it
did
not
seem
as
if
banks
interpreted
the
attack
to
signify
aught
of
future
or
further
movement
by
the
enemy
or
that
it
betokened
any
purpose
to
cut
us
off
from
winchester
i
was
so
fully
impressed
however
with
jackson
purpose
that
as
soon
as
night
set
in
i
sought
banks
at
his
headquarters
i
laboured
long
to
impress
upon
him
what
i
thought
a
duty
to
wit
his
immediate
retreat
upon
winchester
carrying
all
his
sick
and
all
his
supplies
that
he
could
transport
and
destroying
the
remainder
notwithstanding
all
my
solicitations
and
entreaties
he
persistently
refused
to
move
ever
repeating
i
must
develop
the
force
of
the
enemy
from
brook
farm
to
cedar
mountain
pages
and
the
force
that
had
been
sent
out
on
the
buckton
road
had
been
soon
recalled
without
securing
further
information
than
that
the
confederate
pickets
were
in
possession
of
every
road
which
led
west
or
north
from
front
royal
again
did
gordon
at
the
request
of
banks
chief
of
the
staff
endeavour
to
persuade
the
general
to
abandon
strasburg
is
not
a
retreat
he
urged
a
true
military
movement
to
escape
from
being
cut
off
to
prevent
stores
and
sick
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
moved
with
an
unusual
fire
general
banks
who
had
met
all
my
arguments
with
the
single
reply
must
develop
the
force
of
the
enemy
rising
excitedly
from
his
seat
with
much
warmth
and
in
loud
tones
exclaimed
god
sir
i
will
not
retreat
we
have
more
to
fear
sir
from
the
opinions
of
our
friends
than
the
bayonets
of
our
enemies
the
thought
continues
the
brigadier
so
long
the
subject
of
his
meditations
was
at
last
out
banks
was
afraid
of
being
thought
afraid
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
replying
sir
is
not
a
military
reason
for
occupying
a
false
position
it
was
eleven
at
night
when
i
left
him
as
i
returned
through
the
town
i
could
not
perceive
that
anybody
was
troubled
with
anticipation
for
the
morrow
the
antlers
were
driving
sharp
bargains
with
those
who
had
escaped
from
or
those
who
were
not
amenable
to
military
discipline
the
strolling
players
were
moving
crowds
to
noisy
laughter
in
their
canvas
booths
through
which
the
lights
gleamed
and
the
music
sounded
with
startling
shrillness
i
thought
as
i
turned
towards
my
camp
how
unaware
are
all
of
the
drama
jackson
is
preparing
for
us
and
what
merriment
the
morning
will
reveal
fortunately
for
his
own
battalions
the
brigadier
had
his
camp
equipage
and
baggage
packed
and
sent
off
then
and
there
to
winchester
and
though
his
men
had
to
spend
the
night
unsheltered
under
persistent
rain
they
had
reason
to
bless
his
foresight
a
few
nights
later
at
midnight
a
report
was
received
from
one
of
the
front
royal
fugitives
kenly
is
killed
first
maryland
cut
to
pieces
cavalry
ditto
the
enemy
forces
are
or
strong
and
on
the
march
to
strasburg
in
forwarding
this
despatch
to
washington
banks
remarked
that
he
thought
it
much
exaggerated
at
on
the
he
told
stanton
that
the
enemy
force
was
from
to
that
it
was
probably
ewell
division
and
that
jackson
was
still
in
his
front
on
the
valley
turnpike
three
hours
later
he
wrote
to
gordon
informing
him
that
the
enemy
had
fallen
back
to
front
royal
during
the
night
that
ample
reinforcements
had
been
promised
from
washington
and
that
the
division
would
remain
in
strasburg
until
further
orders
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
convinced
that
the
attack
on
front
royal
was
merely
a
raid
and
that
jackson
would
never
dare
to
insert
his
whole
force
between
himself
and
mcdowell
article
in
weekly
by
colonel
strother
to
general
banks
suddenly
by
what
means
we
are
not
told
he
was
made
aware
that
the
confederates
were
in
overwhelming
numbers
and
that
jackson
was
in
command
scarcely
had
general
gordon
digested
the
previous
communication
when
an
orderly
galloping
furiously
to
his
side
delivered
a
pencil
note
from
the
chief
of
staff
orders
have
just
been
received
for
the
division
to
move
at
once
to
middletown
taking
such
steps
to
oppose
the
enemy
reported
to
be
on
the
road
between
front
royal
and
middletown
as
may
seem
proper
banks
was
electrified
at
last
three
weeks
previously
in
writing
to
stanton
he
had
expressed
his
regret
that
he
was
not
to
be
included
in
active
operations
during
the
summer
his
regret
was
wasted
he
was
about
to
take
part
in
operations
of
which
the
activity
on
his
part
at
least
was
more
than
satisfying
such
blindness
as
banks
had
shown
is
difficult
to
explain
his
latest
information
previous
to
the
attack
on
kenly
told
him
that
trains
were
arriving
at
harrisonburg
on
the
and
he
should
certainly
have
inferred
that
jackson
was
in
advance
of
his
waggons
now
from
harrisonburg
across
the
massanuttons
to
front
royal
is
miles
so
it
was
well
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
the
confederates
might
reach
the
latter
village
at
midday
on
the
moreover
banks
himself
had
recognised
that
strasburg
was
an
unfavourable
position
it
is
true
that
it
was
fortified
but
therein
lay
the
very
reason
that
would
induce
the
enemy
to
turn
it
by
front
royal
nor
did
the
idea
which
seems
to
have
held
possession
of
his
mind
throughout
the
night
that
ewell
alone
had
been
sent
to
destroy
kenly
and
had
afterwards
fallen
back
show
much
strategic
insight
front
royal
was
the
weak
point
in
the
federal
position
it
was
of
all
things
unlikely
that
a
commander
energetic
and
skilful
as
jackson
was
well
known
to
be
would
when
he
had
once
advertised
his
presence
fail
to
follow
up
his
first
blow
with
his
whole
force
and
the
utmost
vigour
it
is
only
fair
to
add
that
the
federal
authorities
were
no
wiser
than
their
general
at
two
on
the
morning
of
the
although
the
news
of
kenly
disaster
had
been
fully
reported
they
still
thought
that
there
was
time
to
move
fresh
troops
to
strasburg
from
baltimore
and
washington
it
seemed
incredible
that
jackson
could
be
at
front
royal
arrangements
are
making
ran
stanton
telegram
to
banks
to
send
you
ample
reinforcements
do
not
give
up
the
ship
before
succour
can
arrive
we
may
now
turn
to
jackson
up
to
the
present
his
operations
had
been
perfectly
successful
he
had
captured
over
of
the
enemy
with
a
loss
of
only
or
to
himself
he
had
seized
stores
to
the
value
of
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
pounds
and
a
large
quantity
had
been
burned
by
the
enemy
he
had
turned
the
intrenched
position
at
strasburg
he
threatened
the
federal
line
of
retreat
banks
was
completely
at
his
mercy
and
there
seemed
every
prospect
of
inflicting
on
that
commander
a
defeat
so
decisive
as
to
spread
panic
in
the
council
chambers
of
the
northern
capital
but
the
problem
was
not
so
simple
as
it
seemed
in
the
first
place
although
the
positions
of
the
federals
had
been
thoroughly
examined
both
by
staff
officers
and
scouts
the
information
as
to
their
numbers
was
somewhat
vague
banks
had
actually
about
effectives
at
strasburg
but
so
far
as
the
confederates
knew
it
was
quite
possible
that
he
had
from
to
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
in
war
than
to
get
an
accurate
estimate
of
the
numbers
especially
when
civilians
ignorant
of
military
affairs
are
the
chief
sources
of
information
the
agents
on
whom
jackson
depended
for
intelligence
from
within
the
enemy
lines
were
not
always
selected
because
of
their
military
knowledge
on
the
march
to
front
royal
says
general
taylor
we
reached
a
wood
extending
from
the
mountain
to
the
river
when
a
mounted
officer
from
the
rear
called
jackson
attention
who
rode
back
with
him
a
moment
later
there
rushed
out
of
the
wood
a
young
rather
woman
afterwards
widely
known
as
belle
boyd
breathless
with
speed
and
agitation
some
time
elapsed
before
she
found
her
voice
then
with
much
volubility
she
said
we
were
near
front
royal
that
the
town
was
filled
with
federals
whose
camp
was
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
where
they
had
guns
in
position
to
cover
the
bridge
that
they
believed
jackson
to
be
west
of
the
massanuttons
near
harrisonburg
that
general
banks
was
at
winchester
where
he
was
concentrating
his
widely
scattered
forces
to
meet
jackson
advance
which
was
expected
some
days
later
all
this
she
told
with
the
precision
of
a
staff
officer
making
a
report
and
it
was
true
to
the
letter
jackson
was
possessed
of
this
information
before
he
left
new
market
and
based
his
movements
on
it
but
it
was
news
to
me
in
the
second
place
banks
had
still
the
means
of
escape
he
could
hardly
prevent
the
confederates
from
seizing
winchester
but
he
might
at
least
save
his
army
from
annihilation
jackson
men
were
exhausted
and
the
horses
jaded
since
the
morning
of
the
the
whole
army
had
marched
over
eighty
and
ewell
division
over
ninety
miles
and
this
average
of
seventeen
miles
a
day
had
been
maintained
on
rough
and
muddy
roads
crossed
by
many
unbridged
streams
and
over
a
high
mountain
the
day
which
had
just
passed
had
been
especially
severe
ewell
who
was
in
bivouac
at
cedarville
five
miles
north
of
front
royal
on
the
winchester
turnpike
had
marched
more
than
twenty
miles
and
jackson
own
division
which
had
made
was
on
foot
from
five
in
the
morning
till
nine
at
night
banks
natural
line
of
retreat
led
through
winchester
and
the
confederate
advanced
guard
at
cedarville
was
two
miles
nearer
that
town
than
were
the
federals
at
strasburg
but
it
was
still
possible
that
banks
warned
by
kenly
overthrow
might
withdraw
by
night
and
even
if
he
deferred
retreat
until
daylight
he
might
instead
of
falling
back
on
winchester
strike
boldly
for
front
royal
and
escape
by
manassas
gap
or
lastly
he
might
remain
at
strasburg
at
which
point
he
was
in
communication
although
by
a
long
and
circuitous
road
with
fremont
at
franklin
jackson
had
therefore
three
contingencies
to
provide
against
and
during
the
night
which
followed
the
capture
of
front
royal
he
evolved
a
plan
which
promised
to
meet
them
all
ashby
at
daybreak
was
to
move
with
the
virginia
cavalry
in
the
direction
of
strasburg
and
at
the
same
hour
a
staff
officer
with
a
small
escort
supported
by
taylor
louisianians
was
to
ride
towards
middletown
a
village
five
miles
north
of
strasburg
and
thirteen
from
winchester
and
to
report
frequently
the
and
virginia
cavalry
under
general
steuart
were
to
advance
to
newtown
also
on
the
valley
turnpike
and
eight
miles
from
winchester
while
ewell
with
trimble
brigade
and
his
artillery
was
to
move
to
nineveh
two
miles
north
of
cedarville
and
there
halt
awaiting
orders
the
remainder
of
the
command
was
to
concentrate
at
cedarville
preparatory
to
marching
on
middletown
and
strong
cavalry
patrols
were
to
keep
close
watch
on
the
strasburg
to
front
royal
road
jackson
report
volume
part
page
from
cedarville
to
middletown
is
no
more
than
seven
miles
and
taylor
brigade
is
reported
to
have
moved
at
six
while
ashby
had
presumably
already
marched
but
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
banks
infantry
did
not
leave
strasburg
till
ten
and
that
it
had
five
miles
to
cover
before
reaching
middletown
when
the
confederates
reached
the
turnpike
at
that
village
the
federal
main
body
had
already
passed
and
only
the
was
encountered
it
seems
evident
therefore
that
it
was
not
till
near
noon
that
jackson
patrols
came
in
sight
of
middletown
and
that
the
confederate
advanced
guard
had
taken
at
least
six
hours
to
cover
seven
miles
the
country
however
between
cedarville
and
the
valley
turnpike
was
almost
a
continuous
forest
and
is
very
slow
fighting
the
advance
had
met
with
strong
resistance
general
gordon
had
prudently
sent
the
pennsylvania
to
middletown
at
an
early
hour
with
orders
to
reconnoitre
towards
front
royal
and
to
cover
middletown
until
the
army
had
passed
through
supported
by
a
section
of
artillery
the
regiment
had
moved
eastward
till
it
struck
the
confederate
scouts
some
four
miles
out
on
the
cedarville
road
after
a
long
skirmish
it
was
withdrawn
to
middletown
but
the
maine
cavalry
and
a
squadron
of
the
vermont
about
strong
which
had
been
ordered
by
banks
to
proceed
in
the
same
direction
made
a
vigorous
demonstration
and
then
fell
back
slowly
before
the
advanced
guard
showing
a
bold
front
using
their
carbines
freely
and
taking
advantage
of
the
woods
to
impose
upon
the
enemy
am
these
manoeuvres
succeeded
in
holding
the
confederates
in
check
till
after
ten
for
the
heavy
timber
concealed
the
real
strength
of
the
federals
and
although
ashby
with
the
virginia
had
marched
to
the
scene
of
action
the
infantry
was
not
yet
up
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
at
daybreak
the
valley
army
was
by
no
means
concentrated
jackson
had
with
him
at
cedarville
only
division
his
own
division
having
halted
near
front
royal
this
last
division
it
appears
from
the
reports
did
not
leave
front
royal
until
a
sufficiently
early
hour
considering
the
condition
of
the
men
and
horses
the
absence
of
the
trains
and
the
fact
that
one
of
the
brigades
had
bivouacked
four
miles
south
of
the
village
the
supply
waggons
were
still
eight
miles
south
of
front
royal
in
the
luray
valley
it
was
not
then
till
between
nine
and
ten
that
the
column
cleared
cedarville
and
middletown
was
distant
nearly
three
hours
march
by
an
exceedingly
bad
road
in
all
probability
if
jackson
at
daybreak
or
soon
afterwards
had
marched
boldly
on
middletown
with
ewell
division
he
would
have
been
able
to
hold
banks
on
the
valley
turnpike
until
the
rest
of
his
infantry
and
artillery
arrived
but
he
had
always
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
federals
finding
their
retreat
on
winchester
compromised
might
make
a
dash
for
manassas
gap
now
the
road
from
strasburg
to
manassas
gap
was
protected
throughout
its
length
by
the
north
fork
of
the
shenandoah
and
to
attack
the
federals
on
the
march
should
they
take
this
road
the
confederates
would
have
to
move
through
cedarville
on
front
royal
this
was
the
only
road
by
which
they
could
reach
the
river
and
the
bridges
at
front
royal
were
the
only
available
points
of
passage
jackson
it
appears
was
therefore
reluctant
to
leave
cedarville
within
easy
reach
of
the
bridges
until
he
received
information
of
his
enemy
designs
and
that
information
which
had
to
be
sought
at
a
distance
was
naturally
long
in
coming
criticism
after
the
event
is
easy
but
it
certainly
seems
curious
with
his
knowledge
of
banks
that
jackson
should
have
believed
his
opponent
capable
of
so
bold
a
measure
as
retreat
by
way
of
manassas

it
might
seem
that
on
this
occasion

lost
an
opportunity

are
sometimes
capable
of
desperate

the
time

banks
was
permitted
to
extricate
his
infantry
from
the
toils
the
remainder
of
his
command
was
less
fortunate
the
general
and
his
brigades
reached
winchester
in
safety
but
the
road
between
that
town
and
strasburg
was
a
scene
of
dire
disaster
steuart
with
the
and
virginia
had
struck
newton
before
noon
and
found
a
convoy
of
waggons
strung
out
on
the
valley
turnpike
a
few
shots
threw
everything
into
confusion
many
of
the
teamsters
deserted
their
posts
and
fled
towards
winchester
or
strasburg
waggons
were
upset
several
were
captured
and
others
plundered
but
the
triumph
of
the
confederates
was
the
federal
infantry
had
already
reached
middletown
and
banks
sent
forward
a
regiment
of
cavalry
and
a
brigade
of
infantry
to
clear
the
way
steuart
was
speedily
driven
back
and
the
northerners
resumed
their
march
at
some
distance
behind
the
infantry
came
the
federal
cavalry
about
strong
accompanied
by
a
battery
and
a
small
party
of
zouaves
but
by
the
time
this
force
reached
middletown
ashby
supported
by
the
louisiana
brigade
had
driven
in
the
regiment
hitherto
opposed
to
him
and
emerging
from
the
forest
with
infantry
and
guns
in
close
support
was
bearing
down
upon
the
village
the
batteries
opened
upon
the
solid
columns
of
the
federal
horse
the
louisiana
regiments
deploying
at
the
double
dashed
forward
and
the
northern
squadrons
penned
in
the
narrow
streets
found
themselves
assailed
by
a
heavy
fire
a
desperate
attempt
was
made
to
escape
towards
winchester
and
a
whirling
cloud
of
dust
through
which
the
sabres
gleamed
swept
northward
up
the
turnpike
but
ashby
horsemen
galloping
across
country
headed
off
the
fugitives
some
of
the
confederate
infantry
drew
an
abandoned
waggon
across
the
road
and
others
ran
forward
to
the
roadside
fences
at
such
close
quarters
the
effect
of
the
musketry
was
terrible
in
a
few
moments
the
turnpike
which
had
just
before
teemed
with
life
presented
a
most
appalling
spectacle
of
carnage
and
destruction
the
road
was
literally
obstructed
with
the
mingled
and
confused
mass
of
struggling
and
dying
horses
and
riders
amongst
the
survivors
the
wildest
confusion
ensued
and
they
scattered
in
disorder
in
various
directions
leaving
some
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
confederates

the

of

were
already
blazing
and

flying
in
small
parties
by
every

track
the

however

held
together
drawing

in
the
hope
of
gaining

of

general
hatch
commanding
the

brought
his
guns
into
action
on
a
commanding
ridge
about
a
mile
west
of
the
highway
and

showed
a

with

remaining

forward

with

accompanied
by
the
louisiana
tigers
and
two
batteries
pursued
the
train
of
waggons
that
was
flying
over
the
hills
towards
winchester
the
question
now
to
be
solved
was
whether
the
cavalry
was
the
advanced
or
the
rear
guard
of
the
federal
army
no
message
had
arrived
from
steuart
but
the
people
of
middletown
supplied
the
information
they
reported
that
in
addition
to
the
convoy
a
long
column
of
infantry
had
passed
through
the
village
and
jackson
directing
his
infantry
to
follow
ashby
sent
a
message
to
ewell
to
march
on
winchester
some
delay
took
place
before
the
three
brigades
which
had
now
driven
back
the
federal
cavalry
could
be
brought
back
to
the
turnpike
and
reformed
and
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
when
with
the
stonewall
regiments
leading
the
confederate
infantry
pushed
forward
down
the
pike
the
troops
had
been
on
their
legs
since
dawn
some
of
them
who
had
bivouacked
south
of
front
royal
had
already
marched
sixteen
miles
the
federals
had
more
than
two
hours
start
and
winchester
was
still
twelve
miles
distant
but
the
enemy
cavalry
had
been
routed
and
such
as
remained
of
the
waggons
were
practically
without
a
guard
ashby
and
steuart
with
three
fine
regiments
of
virginia
cavalry
supported
by
the
and
other
batteries
were
well
to
the
front
and
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
to
use
own
words
that
if
banks
reached
winchester
it
would
be
without
a
train
if
not
without
an
army
but
the
irregular
organisation
of
the
valley
forces
proved
a
bar
to
the
fulfilment
of
jackson
hopes
on
approaching
newtown
he
found
that
the
pursuit
had
been
arrested
two
pieces
of
artillery
were
engaging
a
federal
battery
posted
beyond
the
village
but
the
confederate
guns
were
almost
wholly
unsupported
ashby
had
come
up
with
the
convoy
a
few
rounds
of
shell
had
dispersed
the
escort
the
teamsters
fled
and
the
supply
waggons
and
sutlers
carts
of
the
federal
army
filled
with
luxuries
proved
a
temptation
which
the
confederates
were
unable
to
resist
nearly
the
whole
of
ashby
cavalry
and
a
part
of
the
infantry
under
his
command
had
turned
aside
to
pillage
indeed
the
firing
had
not
ceased
in
the
first
onset
upon
the
federal
cavalry
at
middletown
before
some
of
ashby
men
might
have
been
seen
with
a
quickness
more
suitable
to
than
to
soldiers
breaking
from
their
ranks
seizing
each
two
or
three
of
the
captured
horses
and
making
off
across
the
fields
nor
did
the
men
pause
until
they
had
carried
their
illegal
booty
to
their
homes
which
were
in
some
instances
at
the
distance
of
one
or
two
days
journey
that
such
extreme
disorders
could
occur
adds
dabney
and
that
they
could
be
passed
over
without
a
bloody
punishment
reveals
the
curious
inefficiency
of
officers
in
the
confederate
army
dabney
volume
pages
and
the
difficulty
says
general
taylor
speaking
of
the
confederate
cavalry
of
converting
raw
men
into
soldiers
is
enhanced
manifold
when
they
are
mounted
both
man
and
horse
require
training
and
facilities
for
rambling
with
temptation
to
do
so
are
increased
there
was
little
time
and
it
may
be
said
less
disposition
to
establish
camps
of
instruction
living
on
horseback
fearless
and
dashing
the
men
of
the
south
afforded
the
best
possible
material
for
cavalry
they
had
every
quality
but
discipline
and
resembled
prince
charming
whose
manifold
gifts
were
rendered
useless
by
the
malignant
fairy
assuredly
our
cavalry
rendered
much
excellent
service
especially
when
dismounted
and
such
able
officers
as
stuart
hampton
and
the
younger
lees
in
the
east
forrest
green
and
wheeler
in
the
west
developed
much
talent
for
war
but
their
achievements
however
distinguished
fell
far
below
the
standard
that
would
have
been
reached
had
not
the
want
of
discipline
impaired
their
efforts

pages
to
it
is
only
fair
to
add
however
that
the
confederate
troopers
had
to
supply
their
own
horses
receiving
no
compensation
for
their
loss
by
disease
or
capture

in
some
measure

many

three
regiments

a
couple
of
batteries
were
ordered
back
from
bartonsville
with
gordon
in
command
and
this
rearguard
had
not
only
shown
a
formidable
front

had
actually
driven

still
remained

marched
from
sixteen

twenty
miles

not

a

remnant

and
the
stonewall

in
close

the

toiled
onward
through
the

but
the
federal
was
exceedingly
well
handled
the
massachusetts
regiment
held
the
post
of
honour

taking
advantage
of

and

the
gallant

disputed

turned

a
heavy
volley
suddenly
delivered
drove
the
confederate

back
in
confusion
on

the
virginia
was
completely
broken
by
the
rush
of
flying
horsemen
the
guns
were
overridden
and
jackson
and
his
staff
were
left
alone
upon
the
turnpike
in
the
pitch
darkness

was
difficult
to
ascertain
the
enemy
numbers
and
the
flashes
of
their
rifles
dancing
along
the
top
of
the
stone
walls
were
the
only
clue
to
their
position
the
confederate
column
was
ordered
to
deploy
and
the
stonewall
brigade
pushing
into
the
fields
on
either
flank
moved
slowly
forward
over
the
swampy
ground
the
stream
proved
an
impassable
obstacle
both
below
and
above
the
federal
position
but
the
virginia
attacking
the
enemy
in
front
drove
them
back
and
crossed
to
the
further
bank
the
pursuit
however
had
been
much
delayed
and
the
massachusetts
regiment
although
ridden
into
by
their
own
cavalry
fell
back
in
good
order
protected
by
a
strong
line
of
skirmishers
on
either
side
of
the
turnpike
the
confederate
order
of
march
was
now
changed
three
companies
who
were
recruited
from
the
district
and
knew
the
ground
were
ordered
to
the
front
the
virginia
four
or
five
hundred
yards
from
the
skirmish
line
were
to
follow
in

the
cavalry
and
guns
were
left
in
rear
and
the
troops
once
more
took
up
the
line
of
march
for
more
than
an
hour
they
tramped
slowly
forward
the
darkness
grew
more
intense
and
the
chaff
and
laughter
for
the
soldiers
elated
by
success
had
hitherto
shown
no
sign
of
fatigue
died
gradually
away
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
clang
of
accoutrements
the
long
rumble
of
the
guns
and
the
shuffle
of
weary
feet
men
fell
in
the
ranks
overpowered
by
sleep
or
faint
with
hunger
and
the
skirmishers
wading
through
rank
fields
of
wheat
and
clover
stumbling
into
ditches
and
climbing
painfully
over
high
stone
walls
made
tardy
progress
again
and
again
the
enemy
volleys
flashed
through
the
darkness
but
still
there
was
no
halt
for
at
the
head
of
the
regiments
peering
eagerly
into
the
darkness
their
commander
still
rode
forward
as
regardless
of
the
sufferings
of
his
men
as
of
the
bullets
of
the
federal
with
but
one
thought
present
to
his
mind
to
bring
banks
to
battle
and
so
prevent
his
escape
from
winchester
the
student
of
napoleon
had
not
forgotten
the
pregnant
phrase
ask
me
for
anything
but
time
the
indiscipline
of
ashby
cavalry
had
already
given
banks
a
respite
and
undisturbed
by
his
reverses
the
union
general
had
shown
himself
capable
of
daring
measures
had
the
confederates
halted
at
newtown
or
at
bartonsville
the
troops
would
doubtless
have
been
fresher
for
the
next
day
work
but
the
morning
might
have
seen
banks
far
on
his
way
to
the
potomac
or
possibly
strongly
reinforced
when
the
confederate
infantry
had
met
and
overthrown
their
enemy
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
of
food
and
rest
so
long
as
the
men
could
stand
they
were
to
follow
on
his
traces
i
rode
with
jackson
says
general
taylor
through
the
darkness
an
officer
riding

proved
to

sternly
all

sir
they
were
in

i
doubled
teams
on

brought
them
through

in
a
tone
of
relief
to
give
countenance
to
the
quartermaster
if
such
can
be
given
on
a
dark
night
i
remarked
jocosely
never
mind
the
waggons
there
are
quantities
of
stores
in
winchester
and
the
general
has
invited
one
to
breakfast
there
tomorrow
jackson
took
this
seriously
and
reached
out
to
touch
me
on
the
arm
without
physical
wants
himself
he
forgot
that
others
were
differently
constituted
and
paid
little
heed
to
commissariat
but
woe
to
the
man
who
failed
to
bring
up

were

the

were
more
than

jackson
plan
of

was
simple
his

a
general
advance
of
the
whole
brigade
sweeping
across
the
brook
and
up
the
slopes
quickly
drove
in
the
pickets
but
the
enemy
whether
by
skill
or
good
fortune
had
occupied
with
his
main
line
a
position
admirably
adapted
for
an
inferior
force
four
hundred
yards
beyond
the

which
the
confederates
had
seized
rose
a
second
swell
of

and
eight
rifled

supported
by

the
opposite

at
effective
range
jackson
immediately
ordered
up
three
batteries
posting
them
behind
the
crest
and
as
the
sun
rose
drawing
up
the
mist
from
the
little
stream
a
fierce
duel
of
artillery
began
the
battle
the
confederate
gunners
harassed
by
the
enemy
skirmishers
and
overwhelmed
with
shells
suffered
heavily
one
battery
was
compelled
to
retire
with
a
loss
of
men
and
horses
a
second
lost
all
its
officers
and
it
was
not
till
near
seven
that
the
eight
guns
with
their
infantry
escort
were
finally
driven
back
ewell
meanwhile
had
come
into
action
on
the
right
but
the
mist
was
heavy
and
his
advanced
guard
received
with
a
heavy
fire
from
behind
the
stone
walls
was
driven
back
with
a
loss
of
officers

then
the
fog
rose
heavily
and
for
nearly
an
hour
the
engagement
on
this
wing
died
away
about
eight
ewell
batteries
again
came
into
action
and

moved
round
to
take
the

in

but
jackson
meanwhile
was
bringing
matters
to
a
crisis
on

the
federals
still
held
fast
in

but
the
louisiana
taliaferro

retained
hitherto

general
gordon
in
anticipation
of
such
a
movement
had
already
transferred
two
regiments
to
his
right
the
fire
of
this
force
though
delivered
at
close
range
hardly
checked
the
confederate

preserving

would

taylor
and
taliaferro
moved
swiftly
forward
over
rocks
and

the
federal
infantry
gave
way
in
great
disorder
the
cavalry
in

essayed
a
charge
but
the
confederates
as
the
squadrons
rode
boldly
towards
them
halted
where
they
stood
and
the
rolling
volleys
of
the
line
of

drove
back
the
horsemen
with
many
empty
saddles
then
as
taylor
resumed
his
advance
the
stonewall
regiments
with
elzey
in
close
support
rose
suddenly
from
their
covert
and
the

forward

of

frantic
with
triumph
after

months

rushed
out

with

with
laughter
with
the

and
the

the
soldiers
of

with

turned

from

eager
columns
of
infantry
were
pouring
and
deploying
without

were
pushing

was
in

with

handful
of

that
still
remained
with

by
a
single

despatching
an
to

steuart
to
the

jackson
called
up
his
batteries
the
infantry
too
was
hurried
forward
in
order
to
prevent
the
federals
rallying
but
after
a
rapid
march
of
two
hours
the
interval
between
the
confederates
and
the
enemy
was
still
increasing
and
it
was
evident
that
without
cavalry
it
was
useless
to
continue
the
pursuit
not
only
was
the
infantry
utterly
exhausted
but
the
horses
of
the
artillery
were
worn
out
and
about
five
miles
out
of
winchester
the
troops
were
ordered
to
halt
and
bivouac
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
had
marched
over
thirty
miles
in
thirty
hours
during
which
time
they
had
been
almost
continuously
engaged
the
federals
relieved
from
the
pressure
of
the
hostile
fire
gradually
reformed
their
ranks
and
jackson
notwithstanding
the
extraordinary
exertions
he
had
demanded
from
his
troops
his
own
skilful
manoeuvres
and
the
high
spirit
of
his
men
saw
his
opportunity
pass
away
his
impatience
was
almost
uncontrollable
his
staff
was
dispatched
in
all
directions
to
urge
forward
the
remainder
of
the
batteries
we
must
press
them
to
the
potomac
forward
to
the
potomac
such
was
the
tenor
of
every
order
and
at
length
as
the
federals
disappeared
in
the
far
distance
he
ordered
the
artillery
teams
to
be
unhitched
and
the
gunners
thus
mounted
to
pursue
the
enemy
but
before
this
strange
substitute
for
cavalry
had
moved
out
the
lagging
squadrons
arrived
and
with
a
few
fiery
words
they
were
sent
at
speed
down
the
valley
turnpike
but
it
was
too
late
banks
for
the
second
time
was
more
fortunate
than
he
deserved
to
the
misconduct
of
ashby
troopers
and
to
the
pedantic
folly
of
general
steuart
the
escape
of
the
federal
army
must
be
attributed
never
have
i
seen
an
opportunity
when
it
was
in
the
power
of
cavalry
to
reap
a
richer
harvest
of
the
fruits
of
victory
had
the
cavalry
played
its
part
in
this
pursuit
as
well
as
the
four
companies
under
colonel
flournoy
two
days
before
in
the
pursuit
from
front
royal
but
a
small
portion
of
banks
army
would
have
made
its
escape
to
the
potomac
so
runs
jackson
official
report
and
when
the
disorganised
condition
of
the
federal
battalions
as
they
fled
north
from
winchester
is
recalled
it
is
difficult
to
question
the
opinion
therein
expressed
the
precipitate
retreat
from
strasburg
accompanied
by
the
loss
of
waggons
and
of
stores
the
concentrated
attack
of
overwhelming
numbers
followed
by
the
disorderly
rush
through
the
streets
of
winchester
had
for
the
time
being
dissolved
the
bonds
of
discipline
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
federal
regiments
held
together
but
many
men
were
missing
some
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
others
sought
safety
by
devious
roads
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
those
who
fled
to
the
potomac
were
for
the
time
being
utterly
demoralised
had
they
been
resolutely
charged
before
they
had
reformed
their
ranks
their
rifles
would
no
more
have
saved
them
from
annihilation
than
they
had
saved
command
at
cedarville
but
where
was
the
cavalry
ashby
men
all
that
he
had
been
able
to
collect
were
far
away
upon
the
right
out
of
reach
of
orders
and
in
any
case
too
few
for
effective
use
the
two
regiments
under
steuart
or
strong
were
the
force
on
which
jackson
had
depended
and
steuart
had
shown
himself
incapable
of
command
he
had
received
jackson
message
with
the
reply
that
he
could
obey
no
orders
unless
they
came
through
his
immediate
superior
report
before
ewell
could
be
found
precious
time
was
wasted
and
two
hours
elapsed
before
the
cavalry
took
up
the
chase
but
the
federals
had
now
established
strong
the
whole
of
their
cavalry
supported
by
artillery
had
been
ordered
to
cover
the
retreat
and
steuart
although
he
picked
up
numerous
prisoners
and
followed
as
far
as
martinsburg
miles
north
of
winchester
found
no
opportunity
for
attack
halting
for
two
and
a
half
hours
at
martinsburg
the
federals
continued
their
retreat
at
sunset
abandoning
the
magazines
in
the
town
to
their
pursuers

midnight

men
had
arrived
at
williamsport

by
the
ford
and

supplemented
by
a
few
pontoon
boats
the
remnant
of
banks
army
crossed
the
broad
potomac
although
not
a
single
confederate
squadron
had
followed
him
from
martinsburg
the
northern
general
elated
by
his
unexpected
escape
spoke
of
this
operation
as
if
it
had
been
carried
out
under
heavy
fire
it
is
seldom
he
reported
that
a
of
such
magnitude
is
achieved
sic
with
greater
success
but
he
added
with
more
candour
there
were
never
more
grateful
hearts
in
the
same
number
of
men
than
when
at
on
the
we
stood
on
the
opposite
shore
and
then
with
the
loss
of

hundred
waggons

of
his
cavalry
nearly
sick
and
a
vast
quantity
of
stores
to
traverse
his
assertion
he
stated
that
his
command
had
not
suffered
an
attack
or
rout
but
had
accomplished
a
premeditated
march
of
near
sixty
miles
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
defeating
his
plans
and
giving
him
battle
wherever
he
was
found
some
of
banks
officers
shared
his
opinion
the
captain
of
the
zouaves
the
general
who
had
been
cut
off
at
strasburg
but
rejoined
on
the
potomac
reported
that
incredible
as
it
may
appear
my
men
marched
miles
in
hours
as
measured
by
captain
abert
and
concluded
by
congratulating
banks
upon
the
success
of
his
unparalleled
retreat
the
zouaves
at
all
events
could
not
complain
that
they
had
been
excluded
from
active
operations
another
officer
declared
that
we
have
great
reason
to
be
grateful
to
kind
providence
and
applaud
the
skill
and
energy
of
our
commanding
officers

the

the

the

and
the
pursuit
was
continued
until
their
reserves
were
descried
in
strong
force
on
the
bolivar
heights
a
low
ridge
covering
harper
ferry
from
the
south
the
same
evening
ewell
advanced
in
support
of
winder
and
on
the
the
valley
army
was
concentrated
near
halltown
with
the
exception
of
the
louisiana
brigade
posted
near
berryville
the
georgia
with
guns
in
occupation
of
front
royal
and
ashby
on
the
road
to
wardensville
watching
fremont
during
the
afternoon
the
virginia
infantry
was
sent
across
the
shenandoah
and
occupying
the
loudoun
heights
threatened
the
position
on
the
ridge
below
saxton
in
consequence
withdrew
a
part
of
his
troops
the
same
night
to
the
left
bank
of
the
potomac
but
jackson
although
harper
ferry
and
its
magazines
might
easily
have
been
taken
made
no
attempt
to
follow
his
scouts
riding
far
to
east
and
west
had
already
informed
him
that
mcdowell
and
fremont
were
in
motion
to
cut
off
his
retreat
shields
division
leading
advance
from
fredericksburg
was
approaching
manassas
gap
while
fremont
hurrying
from
franklin
through
the
passes
of
the
north
mountain
was
ten
miles
east
of
moorefield
lee
instructions
had
already
been
carried
to
the
extreme
point
consistent
with
safety
and
jackson
determined
to
retreat
by
the
valley
turnpike
not
only
was
it
the
one
road
which
was
not
yet
closely
threatened
but
it
was
the
one
road
over
which
the
enormous
train
of
captured
stores
could
be
rapidly
withdrawn
jackson
although
the
harvest
was
in
full
swing
had
given
orders
that
all
waggons
in
the
valley
were
to
be
impressed
and
sent
to
winchester
and
martinsburg
may
the
next
morning
therefore
the
main
body
of
the
army
marched
back
to
winchester
winder
with
the
stonewall
brigade
and
two
batteries
remaining
before
harper
ferry
to
hold
saxton
in
check
jackson
himself
returned
to
winchester
by
the
railway
and
on
the
way
he
was
met
by
untoward
news
as
the
train
neared
winchester
a
staff
officer
riding
at
a
gallop
across
the
fields
signalled
it
to
stop
and
the
general
was
informed
that
the
georgia
had
been
driven
from
front
royal
burning
the
stores
but
not
the
bridges
at
front
royal
and
that
shields
division
was
in
possession
of
the
village
the
situation
had
suddenly
become
more
than
critical
front
royal
is
but
twelve
miles
from
strasburg
not
a
single
confederate
battalion
was
within
miles
of
that
town
and
winder
was
just
twice
as
far
away
the
next
morning
might
see
the
valley
turnpike
blocked
by
federals
under
shields
another
second
division
under
general
ord
were
already
near
front
royal
fremont
with
was
pressing
forward
from
the
west
and
banks
and
saxton
with
the
same
number
were
moving
south
from
the
potomac
with
resolute
management
it
would
seem
that
federals
might
have
been
assembled
round
strasburg
by
midday
of
the
and
that
this
force
might
have
been
increased
to
by
the
evening
of
june
for
the
distribution
of
the
different
forces
during
this
period
see
note
at
end
of
chapter
desperate
indeed
appeared
the
confederate
chances
the
waggons
which
conveyed
the
spoils
of
martinsburg
and
charlestown
were
still
at
winchester
and
with
them
were
more
than
prisoners
with
the
utmost
expedition
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
valley
army
even
if
the
waggons
were
abandoned
could
reach
strasburg
before
the
evening
of
the
and
the
stonewall
brigade
with
fifty
miles
to
march
would
be
hours
later
escape
at
least
by
the
valley
turnpike
seemed
absolutely
impossible
over
pharaoh
and
his
chariots
the
waters
were
already
closing
but
there
is
a
power
in
war
more
potent
than
mere
numbers
the
moral
difficulties
of
a
situation
may
render
the
proudest
display
of
physical
force
of
no
avail
uncertainty
and
apprehension
engender
timidity
and
hesitation
and
if
the
commander
is
ill
at
ease
the
movements
of
his
troops
become
slow
and
halting
and
when
several
armies
converging
on
a
single
point
are
separated
by
distance
or
by
the
enemy
when
communication
is
tedious
and
each
general
is
ignorant
of
his
colleagues
movements
uncertainty
and
apprehension
are
inevitable
more
than
ever
is
this
the
case
when
the
enemy
has
a
character
for
swiftness
and
audacity
and
some
unfortunate
detachment
is
still
reeling
under
the
effects
of
a
crushing
and
unexpected
blow
regarding
then
like
napoleon
the
difficulties
rather
than
the
numbers
of
his
enemies
jackson
held
fast
to
his
purpose
and
the
capture
of
front
royal
disturbed
him
little
what
news
he
asked
briefly
as
the
staff
officer
rode
up
to
the
carriage
door
colonel
connor
has
been
driven
back
from
front
royal
jackson
smiled
grimly
but
made
no
reply
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
apparently
upon
some
distant
object
then
his
preoccupation
suddenly
disappeared
he
read
the
dispatch
which
he
held
in
his
hand
tore
it
in
pieces
after
his
accustomed
fashion
and
leaning
forward
rested
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
apparently
fell
asleep
he
soon
roused
himself
however
and
turning
to
boteler
who
tells
the
story
said
i
am
going
to
send
you
to
richmond
for
reinforcements
banks
has
halted
at
williamsport
and
is
being
reinforced
from
pennsylvania
dix
saxton
is
in
my
front
and
is
being
reinforced
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
i
have
just
received
a
dispatch
informing
me
of
the
advance
of
the
enemy
upon
front
royal
which
is
captured
and
fremont
is
now
advancing
towards
wardensville
thus
you
see
i
am
nearly
surrounded
by
a
very
large
force
what
is
your
own
general
asked
his
friend
i
will
tell
you
but
you
must
not
repeat
what
i
say
except
at
richmond
to
meet
this
attack
i
have
only
effective
men
what
will
you
do
if
they
cut
you
off
general
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
the
cool
reply
i
will
fall
back
upon
maryland
for
reinforcements
jackson
says
cooke
was
in
earnest
if
his
retreat
was
cut
off
he
intended
to
advance
into
maryland
and
doubtless
make
his
way
straight
to
baltimore
and
washington
depending
on
the
southern
sentiment
in
that
portion
of
the
state
to
bring
him
reinforcements
that
the
federal
government
was
apprehensive
of
some
such
movement
is
certain
the
wildest
rumours
were
everywhere
prevalent
men
throughout
the
north
wore
anxious
faces
and
it
is
said
that
one
question
where
is
jackson
has
he
taken
washington
was
on
every
lip
the
best
proof
however
that
a
movement
on
washington
was
actually
anticipated
by
the
federals
is
the
dispatch
of
the
secretary
of
war
to
the
governors
of
the
different
states
send
forward
all
the
troops
that
you
can
immediately
banks
completely
routed
intelligence
from
various
quarters
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
enemy
in
great
force
are
advancing
on
washington
you
will
please
organise
and
forward
immediately
all
the
volunteer
and
militia
force
in
your
state
further
on
receiving
the
news
of
banks
defeat
the
president
had
called
king
division
of
mcdowell
army
corps
to
defend
the
capital
and
his
telegram
of
may
to
mcclellan
already
alluded
to
in
which
that
general
was
warned
that
he
might
have
to
return
to
washington
is
significant
of
what
would
have
happened
had
the
confederates
entered
maryland
volume
part
page
king
division
when
it
was
found
that
jackson
had
halted
near
winchester
was
ordered
to
front
royal
the
fourth
division
mccall
was
left
to
defend
fredericksburg
mcclellan
vast
army
in
all
human
probability
would
have
been
hurriedly
and
johnston
have
been
free
to
follow
jackson
may
on
the
night
of
the
the
whole
army
of
the
valley
was
ordered
back
to
strasburg
and
early
next
morning
the
prisoners
escorted
by
the
virginia
and
followed
by
the
convoy
of
waggons
in
double
column
covering
seven
miles
of
road
led
the
way
captain
hotchkiss
was
sent
with
orders
to
winder
to
hasten
back
to
winchester
and
not
to
halt
till
he
had
made
some
distance
between
that
place
and
strasburg
i
want
you
to
go
to
charlestown
were
instructions
to
his
staff
officer
and
bring
up
the
first
brigade
i
will
stay
in
winchester
until
you
get
here
if
i
can
but
if
i
can
not
and
the
enemy
gets
here
first
you
must
conduct
it
around
through
the
mountains
the
march
however
as
the
general
had
expected
was
made
without
molestation
and
during
the
afternoon
the
main
body
reached
strasburg
and
camped
there
for
the
night
the
stonewall
brigade
meanwhile
had
passed
through
winchester
halting
near
newtown
the
virginia
regiment
having
marched
miles
and
all
the
remainder
little
had
been
seen
of
the
enemy
fremont
had
passed
wardensville
and
marching
through
heavy
rain
had
halted
after
nightfall
at
cedar
creek
six
miles
west
of
strasburg
on
the
road
to
front
royal
only
a
few
scouts
had
been
encountered
by
the
confederate
patrols
for
shields
deceived
by
a
demonstration
which
the
louisiana
brigade
had
made
from
winchester
had
let
the
day
pass
by
without
a
decisive
movement
the
difficulties
on
which
jackson
had
counted
had
weighted
the
feet
of
his
adversaries
with
lead
up
to
the
time
that
they
arrived
within
striking
distance
of
jackson
they
had
acted
vigorously
shields
marching
eighty
miles
in
five
days
and
fremont
seventy
over
a
mountain
road
fremont
with
miles
to
march
had
suffered
ashby
to
delay
his
progress
and
although
he
had
promised
lincoln
that
he
would
be
in
strasburg
at
five
that
evening
he
had
halted
on
the
mountains
six
miles
distant
shields
far
ahead
of
the
next
division
had
done
nothing
more
than
push
a
brigade
towards
winchester
and
place
strong
pickets
on
every
road
by
which
the
enemy
might
approach
neither
federal
general
could
communicate
with
the
other
for
the
country
between
them
was
held
by
the
enemy
both
had
been
informed
of
the
whereabouts
but
both
were
uncertain
as
to
the
other
movements
and
the
dread
of
encountering
unsupported
the
terrible
weight
of
jackson
onset
had
sapped
their
resolution
both
believed
the
enemy
far
stronger
than
he
really
was
the
fugitives
from
winchester
had
spread
exaggerated
reports
of
the
confederate
numbers
and
the
prisoners
captured
at
front
royal
had
by
no
means
minimised
them
according
to
the
official
records
men
were
taken
by
general
shields
it
is
said
that
when
colonel
connor
in
command
of
the
georgia
regiment
reported
to
jackson
at
winchester
and
gave
rather
a
sensational
account
of
his
defeat
the
general
looked
up
and
asked
in
his
abrupt
manner
colonel
how
many
men
had
you
killed
none
i
am
glad
to
say
general
how
many
wounded
few
or
none
sir
do
you
call
that
fighting
sir
said
jackson
and
immediately
placed
him
under
arrest
from
which
he
was
not
released
for
several
months
banks
impressed
by
the
long
array
of
bayonets
that
had
crowned
the
ridge
at
winchester
rated
them
at
infantry
with
cavalry
and
artillery
in
addition
geary
who
had
retired
in
hot
haste
from
rectortown
burning
his
tents
and
stores
had
learned
he
reported
from
numerous
sources
that
cavalry
were
passing
through
manassas
gap
there
were
constant
rumours
that
strong
reinforcements
were
coming
up
from
richmond
and
even
mcdowell
believed
that
the
army
of
invasion
consisted
of
to
men
fremont
scouts
as
he
approached
strasburg
represented
the
confederate
force
at
to
shields
before
he
crossed
the
blue
ridge
and
found
himself
in
the
vicinity
of
his
old
opponent
had
condemned
the
panic
that
had
seized
his
brother
generals
and
had
told
mcdowell
that
he
would
clear
the
valley
with
his
own
division
but
when
he
reached
front
royal
the
force
that
he
had
scornfully
described
as
insignificant
had
swelled
to
men
troops
from
richmond
he
telegraphed
were
marching
down
the
luray
valley
and
he
urged
that
he
should
be
at
once
supported
by
two
divisions
it
can
not
be
said
that
lincoln
and
stanton
were
to
blame
for
the
indecision
of
the
generals
they
had
urged
fremont
forward
to
strasburg
and
shields
to
front
royal
they
had
informed
them
by
the
telegraph
of
each
other
situation
and
had
passed
on
such
intelligence
of
the
enemy
movements
as
had
been
acquired
at
harper
ferry
and
yet
although
the
information
was
sufficiently
exact
both
shields
and
fremont
just
as
jackson
anticipated
held
back
at
the
decisive
moment
the
waters
had
been
held
back
and
the
confederates
had
passed
through
them
such
is
the
effect
of
uncertainty
in
war
a
mighty
power
in
the
hands
of
a
general
who
understands
its
scope
june
on
the
morning
of
june
jackson
only
remaining
anxiety
was
to
bring
winder
back
and
to
expedite
the
retreat
of
the
convoy
ewell
was
therefore
ordered
to
support
ashby
and
to
hold
fremont
in
check
until
the
stonewall
brigade
had
passed
through
strasburg
the
task
was
easily
accomplished
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
confederate
pickets
were
driven
in
as
they
fell
back
on
their
supports
the
batteries
on
both
sides
came
rapidly
into
action
and
the
federal
infantry
pressed
forward
but
musketry
replied
to
musketry
and
finding
the
road
blocked
by
a
line
of
riflemen
fremont
ordered
his
troops
to
occupy
a
defensive
position
on
cedar
creek
i
was
entirely
ignorant
he
says
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
valley
beyond
and
it
was
now
evident
that
jackson
in
superior
force
was
at
or
near
strasburg
his
men
also
appear
to
have
caught
the
spirit
of
irresolution
for
a
forward
movement
on
the
part
of
the
confederates
drove
in
blenker
germans
with
the
greatest
ease
sheep
says
general
taylor
would
have
made
as
much
resistance
as
we
met
men
decamped
without
firing
or
threw
down
their
arms
and
surrendered
our
whole
skirmish
line
was
advancing
briskly
i
sought
ewell
and
reported
we
had
a
fine
game
before
us
and
the
temptation
to
play
it
was
great
but
jackson
orders
were
imperative
and
wise
he
had
his
stores
to
save
shields
to
guard
against
lee
grand
strategy
to
promote
he
could
not
waste
time
chasing
fremont
destruction
and
reconstruction
page
winder
reached
strasburg
about
noon
the
troops
that
had
been
facing
fremont
were
then
withdrawn
and
the
whole
force
now
reunited
fell
back
on
woodstock
ashby
with
the
cavalry
holding
his
old
position
on
tom
brook
the
retreat
was
made
in
full
view
of
the
federal
scouts
on
the
confederates
retiring
from
before
him
fremont
had
pushed
forward
a
reconnaissance
and
bayard
cavalry
brigade
of
mcdowell
army
came
up
in
the
evening
on
the
other
flank
but
attack
was
useless
the
confederate
trains
were
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
heavy
masses
of
all
arms
were
moving
slowly
south
the
federal
horsemen
were
unsupported
save
by
a
single
battery
mcdowell
who
had
reached
front
royal
with
part
of
his
second
division
in
the
morning
had
endeavoured
to
push
shields
forward
upon
strasburg
but
shields
fearing
attack
had
dispersed
his
troops
to
guard
the
various
roads
and
when
at
last
they
were
assembled
misled
by
erroneous
information
he
had
directed
them
on
winchester
before
the
mistake
was
discovered
the
day
had
passed
away
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
the
federal
columns
came
into
communication
and
then
jackson
was
already
south
of
woodstock
on
friday
morning
may
says
allan
jackson
was
in
front
of
harper
ferry
fifty
miles
from
strasburg
fremont
was
at
fabius
twenty
miles
from
strasburg
and
shields
was
not
more
than
twenty
miles
from
strasburg
for
his
advance
entered
front
royal
which
is
but
twelve
miles
distant
before
while
mcdowell
was
following
with
two
divisions
yet
by
sunday
night
jackson
had
marched
between
fifty
and
sixty
miles
though
encumbered
with
prisoners
and
captured
stores
had
reached
strasburg
before
either
of
his
adversaries
and
had
passed
safely
between
their
armies
while
he
held
fremont
at
bay
by
a
show
of
force
and
blinded
and
bewildered
shields
by
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
from
the
morning
of
may
to
the
night
of
june
a
period
of
fourteen
days
the
army
of
the
valley
had
marched
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
had
routed
a
force
of
men
had
threatened
the
north
with

drawn
off

were
captured
at
winchester
alone
and
small

besides

guns
were
carried
back
to
staunton
and

and
finally
although
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
men
had
brought
off
a
huge
convoy
without
losing
a
single
waggon
this
remarkable
achievement
moreover
had
been
comparatively
bloodless
the
loss
of
officers
and
men
was
a
small
price
to
pay
for
such
results
killed
wounded
missing
captured
that
jackson
lucky
star
was
in
the
ascendant
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
fortune
had
far
less
to
do
with
his
success
than
skill
and
insight
and
in
two
instances
the
misconduct
of
his
cavalry
and
the
surprise
of
the
georgia
the
blind
goddess
played
him
false
not
that
he
trusted
to
her
favours
every
movement
throughout
the
whole
period
says
one
of
his
staff
officers
was
the
result
of
profound
calculation
he
knew
what
his
men
could
do
and
to
whom
he
could
entrust
the
execution
of
important
orders
letter
from
major
hotchkiss
nor
was
his
danger
of
capture
on
his
retreat
from
harper
ferry
so
great
as
it
appeared
may
was
the
crisis
of
his
operations
on
that
morning
when
the
prisoners
and
the
convoy
marched
out
of
winchester
shields
was
at
front
royal
but
shields
was
unsupported
ord
division
was
fifteen
miles
in
rear
and
bayard
cavalry
still
further
east
even
had
he
moved
boldly
on
strasburg
he
could
hardly
have
seized
the
town
the
ground
was
in
jackson
favour
the
only
road
available
for
the
federals
was
that
which
runs
south
of
the
north
fork
and
the
bridges
had
been
destroyed
at
that
point
three
miles
east
of
strasburg
a
small
might
have
blocked
the
way
until
the
main
body
of
the
confederates
had
got
up
and
had
fremont
instead
of
halting
that
evening
at
cedar
creek
swept
ashby
aside
and
pushed
forward
to
join
his
colleague
the
valley
army
might
easily
have
effected
its
retreat
winder
alone
would
have
been
cut
off
and
jackson
had
provided
for
that
emergency
when
the
embarrassments
under
which
the
federals
laboured
are
laid
bare
the
passage
of
the
confederates
between
the
converging
armies
loses
something
of
its
extraordinary
character
nevertheless
the
defeat
of
the
front
royal
garrison
and
the
loss
of
the
bridges
was
enough
to
have
shaken
the
strongest
nerves
had
jackson
then
burnt
his
convoy
and
released
his
prisoners
few
would
have
blamed
him
and
the
tenacity
with
which
he
held
to
his
original
purpose
the
skill
with
which
he
imposed
on
both
shields
and
fremont
are
no
less
admirable
than
his
perception
of
his
opponents
difficulties
well
has
it
been
said
what
gross
ignorance
of
human
nature
do
those
declaimers
display

assert

the

and
for
that
matter
even
the
living
is
a
fair
mark
for
the
heels
of
a
baser
animal
the
greatest
captains
have
not
escaped
the
critics
the
genius
of
napoleon
has
been
belittled
on
the
ground
that
each
one
of
his
opponents
except
wellington
was
only
french
historians
have
attributed
wellington
victories
to
the
mutual
jealousy
of
the
french
marshals
and
it
has
been
asserted
that
moltke
triumphed
only
because
his
adversaries
blundered
judged
by
this
rule
few
reputations
would
survive
in
war
however
it
is
as
impossible
to
avoid
error
as
it
is
to
avoid
loss
of
life
but
it
is
by
no
means
simple
either
to
detect
or
to
take
advantage
of
mistakes
before
both
napoleon
and
wellington
an
unsound
manoeuvre
was
dangerous
in
the
extreme
none
were
so
quick
to
see
the
slip
none
more
prompt
to
profit
by
it
herein
to
a
very
great
extent
lay
the
secret
of
their
success
and
herein
lies
the
true
measure
of
military
genius
a
general
is
not
necessarily
incapable
because
he
makes
a
false
move
both
napoleon
and
wellington
in
the
long
course
of
their
campaigns
gave
many
openings
to
a
resolute
foe
and
both
missed
opportunities
under
ordinary
circumstances
mistakes
may
easily
escape
notice
altogether
or
at
all
events
pass
unpunished
and
the
reputation
of
the
leader
who
commits
them
will
remain
untarnished
but
if
he
is
pitted
against
a
master
of
war
a
single
false
step
may
lead
to
irretrievable
ruin
and
he
will
be
classed
as
beneath
contempt
for
a
fault
which
his
successful
antagonist
may
have
committed
with
impunity
a
hundred
times
over
so
jackson
escape
from
winchester
was
not
due
simply
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
federal
generals
or
to
the
ignorance
of
the
federal
president
lincoln
was
wrong
in
dispatching
mcdowell
to
front
royal
in
order
to
cut
off
jackson
when
shields
in
execution
of
this
order
left
fredericksburg
the
confederates
were
only
five
miles
north
of
winchester
and
had
they
at
once
retreated
mcdowell
must
have
missed
them
by
many
miles
mcdowell
hotly
protesting
declared
and
rightly
that
the
movement
he
had
been
ordered
to
execute
was
strategically
false
it
is
impossible
he
said
that
jackson
can
have
been
largely
reinforced
he
is
merely
creating
a
diversion
and
the
surest
way
to
bring
him
from
the
lower
valley
is
for
me
to
move
rapidly
on
richmond
in
any
case
it
would
be
wiser
to
move
on
gordonsville
volume
part
pages
letter
of
p
chase
his
arguments
were
unavailing
but
when
jackson
pressed
forward
to
the
potomac
it
became
possible
to
intercept
him
and
the
president
did
all
he
could
to
assist
his
generals
he
kept
them
constantly
informed
of
the
movements
of
the
enemy
and
of
each
other
he
left
them
a
free
hand
and
with
an
opponent
less
able
his
instructions
would
have
probably
brought
about
complete
success
nor
were
the
generals
to
blame
they
failed
to
accomplish
the
task
that
had
been
set
them
and
they
made
mistakes
but
the
task
was
difficult
and
if
at
the
critical
moment
the
hazard
of
their
situation
proved
too
much
for
their
resolution
it
was
exactly
what
might
have
been
expected
the
initial
error
of
the
federals
was
in
sending
two
detached
forces
under
men
of
no
particular
strength
of
character
from
opposite
points
of
the
compass
to
converge
upon
an
enemy
who
was
believed
to
be
superior
to
either
of
them
jackson
at
once
recognised
the
blunder
and
foreseeing
the
consequences
that
were
certain
to
ensue
resolved
to
profit
by
them
his
escape
then
was
the
reward
of
his
own
sagacity
when
once
the
actual
position
of
the
confederates
had
been
determined
and
the
dread
that
reinforcements
were
coming
down
the
valley
had
passed
away
the
vigour
of
the
federal
pursuit
left
nothing
to
be
desired
june
directly
it
was
found
that
the
confederates
had
gone
south
on
the
afternoon
of
june
shields
was
directed
on
luray
and
that
night
his
advanced
guard
was
ten
miles
beyond
front
royal
on
the
other
side
of
the
massanuttons
fremont
with
bayard
cavalry
heading
his
advance
moved
rapidly
on
woodstock
the
federal
generals
however
had
to
do
with
a
foe
who
never
relaxed
his
vigilance
whilst
ashby
and
ewell
on
may
were
engaged
with
fremont
at
cedar
creek
jackson
had
expected
that
shields
would
advance
on
strasburg
but
not
a
single
infantry
soldier
was
observed
on
the
front
royal
road
throughout
the
day
such
inaction
was
suspicious
and
the
probability
to
which
it
pointed
had
not
escaped
the
penetration
of
the
confederate
leader
his
line
of
retreat
was
the
familiar
route
by
new
market
and
harrisonburg
to
port
republic
and
thence
to
the
gaps
of
the
blue
ridge
there
he
could
secure
an
unassailable
position
within
reach
of
the
railway
and
of
richmond
but
during
the
movement
danger
threatened
from
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
should
shields
adopt
that
line
of
advance
the
white
house
and
columbia
bridges
would
give
him
easy
access
to
new
market
and
while
fremont
was
pressing
the
confederates
in
rear
their
flank
might
be
assailed
by
fresh
foes
from
the
luray
gap
and
even
if
the
retiring
column
should
pass
new
market
in
safety
shields
holding
the
bridges
at
conrad
store
and
port
republic
might
block
the
passage
to
the
blue
ridge
jackson
looking
at
the
situation
from
his
enemy
point
of
view
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
movement
up
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
was
already
in
progress
and
that
the
aim
of
the
federal
commander
would
be
to
secure
the
bridges
his
conjectures
hit
the
mark
before
leaving
front
royal
shields
ordered
his
cavalry
to
march
rapidly
up
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
and
seize
the
bridge
at
conrad
store
the
white
house
and
columbia
bridges
he
intended
to
secure
himself
but
jackson
was
not
to
be
so
easily
overreached
june
on
the
night
of
june
the
federal
cavalry
reached
luray
to
find
that
they
had
come
too
late
the
white
house
and
columbia
bridges
had
both
been
burned
by
a
detachment
of
confederate
horse
and
shields
was
thus
cut
off
from
new
market
at
dawn
on
the
after
a
forced
night
march
his
advanced
guard
reached
conrad
store
to
find
that
bridge
also
gone
of
the
existence
of
the
bridge
at
port
republic
held
by
a
party
of
confederate
cavalry
the
federals
do
not
appear
to
have
been
aware
and
he
was
once
more
foiled
on
his
arrival
at
luray
the
sound
of
cannon
on
the
other
side
of
the
massanuttons
was
plainly
heard
it
seemed
probable
that
jackson
and
fremont
were
already
in
collision
but
shields
who
had
written
a
few
hours
before
to
stanton
that
with
supplies
and
forage
he
could
stampede
the
enemy
to
richmond
was
unable
to
stir
a
foot
to
assist
his
colleague
once
again
jackson
had
turned
to
account
the
strategic
possibilities
of
the
massanuttons
and
the
shenandoah
and
to
increase
general
shields
embarrassment
the
weather
had
broken
heavy
and
incessant
submerged
the
virginia
roads
he
was
ahead
of
his
supplies
much
hampered
by
the
mud
and
the
south
fork
of
the
shenandoah
cutting
him
off
from
fremont
rolled
a
volume
of
rushing
water
which
it
was
impossible
to
bridge
without
long
delay
meanwhile
west
of
the
great
mountain
the
tide
of
war
which
had
swept
with
such
violence
to
the
potomac
came
surging
back
fremont
by
the
rapidity
of
his
pursuit
made
full
amends
for
his
lack
of
vigour
at
cedar
creek
a
cloud
of
horsemen
filled
the
space
between
the
hostile
columns
day
after
day
the
quiet
farms
and
sleepy
villages
on
the
valley
turnpike
heard
the
thunder
of
ashby
guns
every
stream
that
crossed
the
road
was
the
scene
of
a
fierce
skirmish
and
the
ripening
corn
was
trampled
under
the
hoofs
of
the
charging
squadrons
on
june
the
first
day
of
the
pursuit
between
strasburg
and
woodstock
the
federals
boldly
led
by
bayard
gained
a
distinct
advantage
a
dashing
attack
drove
in
the
confederate
swept
away
the
horse
artillery
and
sent
ashby
and
steuart
regiments
exhausted
by
hunger
and
loss
of
sleep
flying
up
the
valley
many
prisoners
were
taken
and
the
pursuit
was
only
checked
by
a
party
of
infantry
stragglers
whom
ashby
had
succeeded
in
rallying
across
the
road
next
day
june
the
skirmishing
was
continued
and
the
confederates
burning
the
bridges
across
the
roads
retreated
to
mount
jackson
june
on
the
the
bridge
over
the
north
fork
was
given
to
the
flames
ashby
whose
horse
was
shot
under
him
remaining
to
the
last
and
the
deep
and
turbulent
river
placed
an
impassable
obstacle
between
the
armies
under
a
deluge
of
rain
the
federals
attempted
to
launch
their
pontoons
but
the
boats
were
swept
away
by
the
rising
flood
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
the
bridge
was
made
june
the
confederates
had
thus
gained
hours
respite
and
contact
was
not
resumed
until
the
jackson
meanwhile
constructing
a
ferry
at
mount
crawford
had
sent
his
sick
and
wounded
to
staunton
thus
saving
them
the
long
detour
by
port
republic
and
dispatching
his
stores
and
prisoners
by
the
more
circuitous
route
had
passed
through
harrisonburg
to
cross
keys
a
clump
of
buildings
on
mill
creek
where
on
the
night
of
the
his
infantry
and
artillery
with
the
exception
of
a
brigade
supporting
the
cavalry
went
into
bivouac
june
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
federal
cavalry
followed
ashby
some
three
miles
from
harrisonburg
is
a
tract
of
forest
crowning
a
long
ridge
and
within
the
timber
the
confederate
squadrons
occupied
a
strong
position
the
enemy
strong
pursued
without
precaution
charged
up
a
gentle
hill
and
were
repulsed
by
a
heavy
fire
then
ashby
let
loose
his
mounted
men
on
the
broken
ranks
and
the
federals
were
driven
back
to
within
half
a
mile
of
harrisonburg
losing
officers
and
men
smarting
under
this
defeat
fremont
threw
forward
a
still
stronger
force
of
cavalry
strengthened
by
two
battalions
of
infantry
ashby
had
already
called
up
a
portion
of
the
brigade
which
supported
him
and
met
the
attack
in
a
clearing
of
the
forest
the
fight
was
fierce
the
confederates
were
roughly
handled
by
the
northern
riflemen
and
the
ranks
began
to
waver
riding
to
the
front
where
the
opposing
lines
were
already
at
close
range
ashby
called
upon
his
infantry
to
charge
as
he
gave
the
order
his
horse
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
leaping
to
his
feet
in
an
instant
again
he
shouted
charge
men
for
sake
charge
the
regiments
rallied
and
inspired
by
his
example
swept
forward
from
the
wood
but
hardly
had
they
left
the
covert
when
their
leader
fell
shot
through
the
heart
he
was
speedily
avenged
the
men
who
followed
him
despite
the
heavy
fire
dashed
at
the
enemy
in
front
and
flank
and
drove
them
from
their
ground
the
cavalry
meanwhile
had
worked
round
in
rear
the
horse
artillery
found
an
opportunity
for
action
and
under
cover
of
the
night
the
federals
fell
back
on
harrisonburg
the
losses
of
the
union
troops
were
heavy
but
the
confederate
victory
was
dearly
purchased
the
death
of
ashby
was
a
terrible
blow
to
the
army
of
the
valley
from
the
outbreak
of
the
war
he
had
been
employed
on
the
shenandoah
and
from
staunton
to
the
potomac
his
was
the
most
familiar
figure
in
the
confederate
ranks
his
daring
rides
on
his
famous
white
charger
were
already
the
theme
of
song
and
story
and
if
the
tale
of
his
exploits
as
told
in
camp
and
farm
sometimes
bordered
on
the
marvellous
the
bare
truth
stripped
of
all
exaggeration
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
make
a
hero
his
reckless
courage
his
fine
horsemanship
his
skill
in
handling
his
command
and
his
power
of
stimulating
devotion
were
not
the
only
attributes
which
incited
admiration
with
such
qualities
it
is
said
were
united
the
utmost
generosity
and
unselfishness
and
a
delicacy
of
feeling
equal
to
a
woman
his
loss
came
home
with
especial
force
to
jackson
after
the
unfortunate
episode
in
the
pursuit
from
middletown
he
had
rated
his
cavalry
leader
in
no
measured
terms
for
the
indiscipline
of
his
command
and
for
some
days
their
intercourse
usually
most
cordial
had
been
simply
official
sensitive
in
the
extreme
to
any
reflection
upon
himself
or
his
troops
ashby
held
aloof
and
jackson
always
stern
when
a
breach
of
duty
was
concerned
made
no
overtures
for
a
renewal
of
friendly
intercourse
fortunately
before
the
fatal
fight
near
harrisonburg
they
had
been
fully
reconciled
and
with
no
shadow
of
remorse
jackson
was
able
to
offer
his
tribute
to
the
dead
entering
the
room
in
port
republic
whither
the
body
had
been
brought
he
remained
for
a
time
alone
with
his
old
comrade
and
in
sending
an
order
to
his
cavalry
added
poor
ashby
is
dead
he
fell
gloriously
one
of
the
noblest
men
and
soldiers
in
the
confederate
army
a
more
public
testimony
was
to
come
in
his
official
report
he
wrote
the
close
relation
general
ashby
bore
to
my
command
for
most
of
the
previous
twelve
months
will
justify
me
in
saying
that
as
a
partisan
officer
i
never
knew
his
superior
his
daring
was
proverbial
his
powers
of
endurance
almost
incredible
his
character
heroic
and
his
sagacity
almost
intuitive
in
divining
the
purposes
and
movements
of
the
enemy
on

the
confederate
infantry

on
the
banks
of

near

the
cavalry
on
either
flank
of
the
massanuttons
watched
both
fremont
camps
at
harrisonburg
and
the
slow
advance
of

on
the
southern
peak
of
the
mountains

in
unwonted
quiet
for
the
first
time
for
fifteen
days
since
the
storming

the

of

was
silent
the
glory
of

undisturbed

as
the

down

the

still
and
peaceful
in
the
sunshine
not
a
single
federal
scout
observed
the
melancholy
cortege
fremont
pursuit
had
been
roughly
checked
he
was
uncertain
in
which
direction
the
main
body
of
the
confederates
had
retreated
and
it
was
not
till
evening
that
a
strong
force
of
infantry
reconnoitring
through
the
woods
struck
jackson

near
the

shots

preparing
to
cross
the
river
later
in
the
day
a
patrol
which
had
managed
to
communicate
with
fremont
informed
him
that
jackson
was
retreating
and
the
instructions
he
thereupon
dispatched
to
the
officer
commanding
his
advanced

are
worthy
of
record

has
flung
away
everything
and
their
stragglers

they
need
only
a
movement
on
the

them
and
break
them
into
fragments
no

a
chance

shields
throwing

to
the
winds
determined
to
move
as
rapidly
as
possible
on

he
had
written
to
fremont
urging
a
combined
attack
on
the
demoralised
rebels
and
he
thought
that
together
they
would
finish
jackson
his
only
anxiety
was
that
the
enemy
might
escape
and
in
his
haste
he
neglected
the
warning
of
his
corps
commander
mcdowell
on
dispatching
him
in
pursuit
had
directed
his
attention
to
the
importance
of
keeping
his
division
well
closed
up
predilection
for
dealing
with
exposed
detachments

evidently
been

shields
force
however
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
the
road
the
mud
the
and
the
swollen
streams
was
already
divided
into
several
distinct
fractions
his
advanced
brigade
was
south
of
conrad
store
a
second
was
some
miles
in
rear
and
two
were
at
luray
retained
at
that
point
in
consequence
of
a
report
that
confederates
were
crossing
the
blue
ridge
by
thornton
gap
to
correct
this
faulty
formation
before
advancing
he
thought
was
not
worth
while
on
the
night
of
june
he
was
sure
of
his
prey
the
situation
at
this
juncture
was
as
follows
shields
was
stretched
out
over
miles
of
road
in
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
fremont
was
at
harrisonburg
ewell
division
was
near
cross
keys
and
the
main
body
of
the
valley
army
near
port
republic
during
his
retreat
jackson
had
kept
his
attention
fixed
on
shields
that
ardent
irishman
pictured
his
old
enemy
flying
in
confusion
intent
only
on
escape
he
would
have
been
much
astonished
had
he
learned
the
truth
from
the
moment
jackson
left
strasburg
during
the
whole
time
he
was
retreating
with
the
at
his
heels
he
was
meditating
a
and
his
victim
had
already
been
selected
when
shields
rushed
boldly
up
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
it
seemed
that
an
opportunity
of
avenging
kernstown
was
about
to
offer
on
june
the
day
that
the
enemy
reached
luray
ewell
was
ordered
to
provide
his
men
with
two
days
cooked
rations
and
to
complete
their
ammunition
for
active
service
the
next
day
however
it
was
found
that
shields
had
halted
ewell
was
ordered
to
stand
fast
and
jackson
wrote
despondently
to
lee
at
present
i
do
not
see
that
i
can
do
much
more
than
rest
my
command
and
devote
its
time
to
drilling
on
the
however
he
learned
that
advanced
guard
had
resumed
its
march
and
like
a
tiger
crouching
in
the
jungle
he
prepared
to
spring
upon
his
prey
but
fremont
was
close
at
hand
and
shields
and
fremont
between
them
mustered
nearly
men
they
were
certainly
divided
by
the
shenandoah
but
they
were
fast
converging
on
port
republic
and
in
a
couple
of
marches
if
not
actually
within
sight
of
each
other
camps
they
would
come
within
hearing
of
each
other
guns
yet
notwithstanding
their
numbers
jackson
had
determined
to
deal
with
them
in
detail
a
few
miles
from
the
camp
at
port
republic
was
a
hill
honeycombed
with
caverns
known
as
the
grottoes
of
the
shenandoah
in
the
heart
of
the
limestone
nature
has
built
herself
a
palace
of
many
chambers
vast
silent
and
magnificent
but
far
beyond
the
beauty
of
her
mysterious
halls
was
the
glorious
prospect
which
lay
before
the
eyes
of
the
confederate
sentries
glimmering
aisles
and
dark
recesses
where
no
sunbeam
lurks
nor
summer
wind
whispers
compared
but
ill
with
those
fruitful
valleys
watered
by
clear
brown
rivers
and
steeped
in
the
glow
of
a
virginian
june
to
the
north
stood
the
massanuttons
with
their
forests
sleeping
in
the
and
to
the
right
of
the
massanuttons
displaying
in
that
transparent
atmosphere
every
shade
of
that
royal
colour
from
which
it
takes
its
name
the
blue
ridge
loomed
large
against
the
eastern
sky
summit
after
summit
each
more
delicately
pencilled
than
the
last
receded
to
the
horizon
and
beneath
their
feet
still
dark
and
unbroken
as
the
primeval
wilderness
broad
leagues
of
woodland
stretched
far
away
over
a
lonely
land
no
boasts
a
fairer
setting
than
port
republic
but
lover
of
nature
as
he
was
the
region
was
attractive
to
jackson
for
reasons
of
a
sterner
sort
it
was
eminently
adapted
for
the
purpose
he
had
at
heart
the
south
fork
of
the
shenandoah
is
formed
by
the
junction
of
two
streams
the
north
and
south
rivers
the
village
of
port
republic
lying
on
the
peninsula
between
the
two
the
bridge
crosses
the
north
river
just
above
the
junction
carrying
the
harrisonburg
road
into
port
republic
but
the
south
river
which
cuts
off
port
republic
from
the
luray
valley
is
passable
only
by
two
difficult
fords
north
of
the
village
on
the
left
bank
of
the
shenandoah
a
line
of
high
bluffs
covered
with
scattered
timber
completely
commands
the
tract
of
open
country
which
lies
between
the
river
and
the
blue
ridge
and
across
this
tract
ran
the
road
by
which
shields
was
marching
four
miles
of
port
republic
near
the
village
of
cross
keys
the
road
to
harrisonburg
crosses
mill
creek
a
strong
position
for
defence
by
transferring
his
army
across
the
shenandoah
and
burning
the
bridge
at
port
republic
jackson
could
easily
have
escaped
fremont
and
have
met
shields
in
the
luray
valley
with
superior
force
but
the
plain
where
the
battle
must
be
fought
was
commanded
by
the
bluffs
on
the
left
bank
of
the
shenandoah
and
should
fremont
advance
while
an
engagement
was
in
progress
even
though
he
could
not
cross
the
stream
he
might
assail
the
confederates
in
flank
with
his
numerous
batteries
in
order
then
to
gain
time
in
which
to
deal
with
shields
it
was
essential
that
fremont
should
be
held
back
and
this
could
only
be
done
on
the
left
bank
further
if
fremont
could
be
held
back
until
shields
force
was
annihilated
the
former
would
be
isolated
if
jackson
could
hold
the
bridge
at
port
republic
and
also
prevent
fremont
reaching
the
bluffs
he
could
recross
when
he
had
done
with
shields
and
fight
fremont
without
fear
of
interruption
to
reverse
the
order
and
to
annihilate
fremont
before
falling
upon
shields
was
out
of
the
question
whether
he
advanced
against
fremont
or
whether
he
stood
still
to
receive
his
attack
jackson
rear
and
communications
threatened
by
shields
must
be
protected
by
a
strong
detachment
it
would
be
thus
impossible
to
meet
fremont
with
superior
or
even
equal
numbers
and
an
army
weaker
on
the
battlefield
could
not
make
certain
of
decisive
victory
jackson
had
determined
to
check
fremont
at
mill
creek
but
the
situation
was
still
uncertain
fremont
had
halted
at
harrisonburg
and
it
was
possible
that
he
might
advance
no
further
so
the
confederates
were
divided
ready
to
meet
either
adversary
ewell
remaining
at
cross
keys
and
the
stonewall
division
encamping
near
port
republic
june
on
the
morning
of
june
however
it
was
found
that
fremont
was
moving
ewell
division
was
already
under
arms
at
his
pickets
about
two
miles
to
the
front
became
engaged
and
the
confederate
regiments
moved
leisurely
into
position
the
line
ran
along
the
crest
of
a
narrow
ridge
commanding
an
open
valley
through
which
mill
creek
an
insignificant
brook
ran
parallel
to
the
front
the
further
slopes
open
and
unobstructed
except
for
scattered
trees
and
a
few
fences
rose
gently
to
a
lower
ridge
about
a
mile
distant
the
ground
held
by
the
confederates
was
only
partially
cleared
and
from
the
port
republic
road
in
the
centre
at
a
distance
of
six
hundred
yards
on
either
flank
were
woods
of
heavy
timber
enclosing
the
valley
and
jutting
out
towards
the
enemy
the
ridge
beyond
the
valley
was
also
thickly
wooded
but
here
too
there
were
open
spaces
on
which
batteries
might
be
deployed
and
the
forest
in
rear
where
ashby
had
been
killed
standing
on
higher
ground
completely
concealed
the
federal
approach
the
pickets
however
had
given
ample
warning
of
the
coming
attack
and
when
at
the
hostile
artillery
appeared
on
the
opposite
height
it
was
received
with
a
heavy
fire
eight
and
a
half
batteries
says
fremont
were
brought
into
action
within
thirty
minutes
against
this
long
array
of
guns
the
confederates
massed
only
five
batteries
but
these
commanded
the
open
ground
and
were
all
in
action
from
the
first
ewell
had
with
him
no
more
than
three
brigades
the
louisiana
regiments
had
bivouacked
near
port
republic
and
were
not
yet
up
the
whole
strength
of
the
troops
which
held
the
ridge
was
no
more
than
infantry
and
perhaps
cavalry
fremont
had
at
least
infantry
twelve
batteries
and
cavalry
it
was
then
against
overwhelming
numbers
that
ewell
was
asked
to
hold
his
ground
and
the
remainder
of
the
army
was
four
miles
in
rear
jackson
himself
was
still
absent
from
the
field
the
arrangements
for
carrying
out
his
ambitious
plans
had
met
with
an
unexpected
hitch
in
the
luray
valley
from
conrad
store
northwards
the
space
between
the
blue
ridge
and
the
shenandoah
was
covered
for
the
most
part
with
dense
forest
and
through
this
forest
ran
the
road
moving
beneath
the
spreading
foliage
of
oak
and
hickory
shields
advanced
brigade
was
concealed
from
the
observation
of
the
confederate
cavalry
and
the
signallers
on
the
mountain
endangered
by
fremont
movement
had
been
withdrawn
north
of
port
republic
between
the
of
the
blue
ridge
and
the
shenandoah
lies
a
level
tract
of
arable
and
meadow
nearly
a
mile
wide
and
extending
for
nearly
three
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
on
the
plain
were
the
confederate
pickets
furnished
by
three
companies
of
ashby
regiment
with
their
patrols
on
the
roads
towards
conrad
store
and
there
seemed
little
chance
that
shields
would
be
able
to
reach
the
fords
over
the
south
river
much
less
the
port
republic
bridge
without
long
notice
being
given
of
his
approach
the
cavalry
however
as
had
been
already
proved
were
not
entirely
to
be
depended
on
jackson
whose
headquarters
were
within
the
village
had
already
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
forward
to
cross
keys
when
there
was
a
distant
fire
a
sudden
commotion
in
the
streets
and
a
breathless
messenger
from
the
outposts
reported
that
not
only
had
the
squadrons
on
picket
been
surprised
and
scattered
but
that
the
enemy
was
already
fording
the
south
river
between
the
two
rivers
of
port
republic
were
the
confederate
trains
parked
in
the
open
fields
here
was
battery
with
a
small
escort
and
now
the
cavalry
had
fled
there
were
no
other
troops
save
a
single
company
of
the
virginia
on
this
side
the
shenandoah
the
squadron
which
headed
the
federal
advanced
guard
was
accompanied
by
two
guns
one
piece
was
sent
towards
the
bridge
the
other
unlimbering
on
the
further
bank
opened
fire
on
the
church
and
the
horsemen
trotted
cautiously
forward
into
the
village
street
jackson
warned
of
his
danger
had
already
made
for
the
bridge
and
crossing
at
a
gallop
escaped
capture
by
the
barest
margin
of
time
his
chief
of
artillery
colonel
crutchfield
was
made
prisoner
with
mcguire
and
captain
willis
all
three
of
these
officers
escaped
from
their
captors
and
his
whole
staff
was
dispersed
save
captain
pendleton
a
sterling
soldier
though
hardly
more
than
a
boy
in
years
and
the
danger
was
not
over
with
the
trains
was
the
whole
of
the
reserve
ammunition
and
it
seemed
that
a
crushing
disaster
was
near
at
hand
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
enemy
caused
the
greatest
consternation
amongst
the
teamsters
several
of
the
waggons
went
off
by
the
staunton
road
and
had
the
federal
cavalry
come
on
the
whole
would
have
been
stampeded
but
carrington
battery
was
called
to
the
front
by
captain
moore
commanding
the
company
of
infantry
in
the
village
the
picket
promptly
put
into
position
opened
with
a
volley
and
a
few
rounds
checked
the
enemy
advance
the
guns
came
rapidly
and
effectively
into
action
and
at
this
critical
moment
jackson
intervened
with
his
usual
vigour
according
to
general
account
his
cavalry
had
reported
to
him
that
the
bridge
at
port
republic
had
been
burned
and
he
had
therefore
ordered
his
advanced
guard
to
take
up
a
defensive
position
and
prevent
the
confederates
crossing
the
shenandoah
river
it
was
the
head
of
the
detachment
which
had
dispersed
the
confederate
squadrons
from
the
left
bank
of
the
north
river
he
saw
a
gun
bearing
on
the
bridge
the
village
swarming
with
blue
uniforms
and
more
artillery
unlimbering
across
the
river
he
had
already
sent
orders
for
his
infantry
to
fall
in
and
a
was
hurrying
to
the
front
i
was
surprised
said
the
officer
to
whose
battery
this
piece
belonged
to
see
a
gun
posted
on
the
opposite
bank
although
i
had
met
a
cavalry
man
who
told
me
that
the
enemy
were
advancing
up
the
river
still
i
did
not
think
it
possible
they
could
have
brought
any
guns
into
the
place
in
so
short
a
time
it
thereupon
occurred
to
me
that
the
piece
at
the
bridge
might
be
one
of
carrington
whose
men
had
new
uniforms
something
like
those
we
saw
at
the
bridge
upon
suggesting
this
to
the
general
he
reflected
a
moment
and
then
riding
a
few
paces
to
the
left
and
front
he
called
out
in
a
tone
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
enemy
bring
that
gun
up
here
but
getting
no
reply
he
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
and
in
a
most
authoritative
and
seemingly
angry
tone
he
shouted
bring
that
gun
up
here
i
say
at
this
they
began
to
move
the
trail
of
the
gun
so
as
to
bring
it
to
bear
on
us
which
when
the
general
perceived
he
turned
quickly
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
my
gun
and
said
in
his
sharp
quick
way
let
have
it
the
words
had
scarcely
left
his
lips
when
lieutenant
brown
who
had
his
piece
charged
and
aimed
sent
a
shot
right
among
them
so
disconcerting
them
that
theirs
in
reply
went
far
above
us
related
by
colonel
poague
the
confederate
battalions
some
of
which
had
been
formed
up
for
inspection
or
for
the
sunday
service
when
the
alarm
was
given
had
now
come
up
and
the
virginia
was
ordered
to
capture
the
gun
and
to
clear
the
village
without
a
moment
hesitation
the
regiment
charged
with
a
yell
across
the
bridge
and
so
sudden
was
the
rush
that
the
federal
artillerymen
were
surprised
the
gun
was
with
canister
and
the
head
of
the
column
should
have
been
swept
away
but
the
aim
was
high
and
the
confederates
escaped
then
as
the
limber
came
forward
the
horses
terrified
by
the
heavy
fire
and
the
yells
of
the
charging
infantry
became
unmanageable
and
the
gunners
abandoning
the
fled
through
the
streets
of
port
republic
the
rushed
forward
with
a
yell
the
hostile
cavalry
following
the
gunners
sought
safety
by
the
fords
and
as
the
rout
dashed
through
the
shallow
water
the
confederate
batteries
coming
into
action
on
the
high
bluffs
west
of
the
shenandoah
swept
the
plain
below
with
shot
and
shell
the
hostile
artillery
beyond
the
stream
was
quickly
overpowered
horses
were
shot
down
wholesale
a
second
gun
was
abandoned
on
the
road
a
third
which
had
only
two
horses
and
a
driver
left
was
thrown
into
a
swamp
and
a
fourth
was
found
on
the
field
without
either
team
or
men
the
federal
infantry
was
not
more
fortunate
carroll
brigade
of
four
regiments
was
close
in
rear
of
the
artillery
when
the
confederate
batteries
opened
fire
catching
the
contagion
from
the
flying
cavalry
it
retreated
northward
in
confusion
a
second
brigade
tyler
came
up
in
support
but
the
bluffs
beyond
the
river
were
now
occupied
by
jackson
infantry
a
stream
of
fire
swept
the
plain
and
as
shields
advanced
guard
followed
by
the
confederate
cavalry
fell
back
to
the
woods
whence
it
had
emerged
five
miles
away
on
the
other
flank
was
heard
the
roar
of
the
cannonade
which
opened
the
battle
of
cross
keys
from
the
hurried
flight
of
the
federals
it
was
evident
that
main
body
was
not
yet
up
so
placing
two
brigades
in
position
to
guard
the
bridge
jackson
sent
the
remainder
to
ewell
and
then
rode
to
the
scene
of
action
fremont
under
cover
of
his
guns
had
made
his
preparations
for
attack
but
the
timidity
which
he
had
already
displayed
when
face
to
face
with
jackson
had
once
more
taken
possession
of
his
faculties
vigorous
in
pursuit
of
a
flying
enemy
when
that
enemy
turned
at
bay
his
courage
vanished
the
confederate
position
was
undoubtedly
strong
but
it
was
not
impregnable
the
woods
on
either
flank
gave
access
under
cover
to
the
central
ridge
the
superior
weight
of
his
artillery
was
sufficient
to
cover
an
advance
across
the
open
and
although
he
was
without
maps
or
guide
the
country
was
not
so
intersected
as
to
render
manoeuvring
impracticable
in
his
official
report
fremont
lays
great
stress
on
the
difficulties
of
the
ground
but
reading
between
the
lines
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
was
the
military
situation
which
overburdened
him
the
vicious
strategy
of
converging
columns
where
intercommunication
is
tedious
and
uncertain
once
more
exerted
its
paralysing
influence
it
was
some
days
since
he
had
heard
anything
of
shields
that
dispatch
urging
a
combined
attack
had
not
yet
reached
him
whether
he
had
passed
luray
or
whether
he
had
been
already
beaten
fremont
was
altogether
ignorant
and
in
his
opinion
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
whole
of
the
confederate
army
was
before
him
a
more
resolute
commander
would
probably
have
decided
that
the
shortest
way
out
of
the
dilemma
was
a
vigorous
attack
if
shields
was
within
hearing
of
the
guns
and
it
was
by
no
means
improbable
that
he
was
such
a
course
was
the
surest
means
of
securing
his
and
even
if
no
help
came
and
the
confederates
maintained
their
position
they
might
be
so
crippled
as
to
be
unable
to
pursue
defeat
would
not
have
been
an
irreparable
misfortune
washington
was
secure
banks
saxton
and
mcdowell
held
the
approaches
and
if
fremont
himself
were
beaten
back
the
strategic
situation
could
be
in
no
way
affected
in
fact
a
defeat
if
it
had
followed
an
attack
so
hotly
pressed
as
to
paralyse
jackson
for
the
time
being
would
have
been
hardly
less
valuable
than
a
victory
fortune
it
has
been
well
said
loves
a
daring
suitor
and
he
who
throws
down
the
gauntlet
may
always
count
upon
his
adversary
to
help
him
fremont
however
was
more
afraid
of
losing
the
battle
than
anxious
to
win
it
taking
counsel
of
his
fears
he
would
run
no
risks
but
neither
could
he
abstain
from
action
altogether
an
enemy
was
in
front
of
him
who
for
seven
days
had
fled
before
him
and
his
own
army
anticipated
an
easy
triumph
so
like
many
another
general
who
has
shrunk
from
the
nettle
danger
he
sought
refuge
in
the
most
damning
course
of
all
of
regiments
present
on
the
field
of
battle
five
only
of
blenker
germans
were
sent
forward
to
the
attack
their
onslaught
was
directed
against
the
confederate
right
and
here
within
the
woods
trimble
had
posted
his
brigade
in
a
most
advantageous
position
a
ridge
covered
with
great
oaks
looked
down
upon
a
wide
meadow
crossed
by
a
stout
fence
and
beyond
the
hollow
lay
the
woods
through
which
the
federals
already
in
contact
with
the
confederate
outposts
were
rapidly
advancing
the
pickets
soon
gave
way
and
crossing
the
meadow
found
cover
within
the
thickets
where
trimble
three
regiments
lay
concealed
in
hot
pursuit
came
the
federal
skirmishers
with
the
solid
lines
of
their
brigade
in
close
support
steadily
moving
forward
they
climbed
the
fence
and
breasted
the
gentle
slope
beyond
a
few
scattered
shots
fired
by
the
retreating
pickets
were
the
only
indications
of
the
presence
the
groves
beyond
were
dark
and
silent
the
skirmishers
had
reached
the
crest
of
the
declivity
and
the
long
wave
of
bayonets
following
close
upon
their
tracks
was
within
sixty
paces
of
the
covert
when
the
thickets
stirred
suddenly
with
sound
and
movement
the
southern
riflemen
rose
swiftly
to
their
feet
a
sheet
of
fire
ran
along
their
line
followed
by
a
crash
that
resounded
through
the
woods
and
the
german
regiments
after
a
vigorous
effort
to
hold
their
ground
fell
back
in
disorder
across
the
clearing
here
on
the
further
edge
they
rallied
on
their
reserves
and
the
confederates
who
had
followed
up
no
further
than
was
sufficient
to
give
impetus
to
the
retreat
were
once
more
withdrawn
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
as
the
enemy
showed
no
inclination
to
attempt
a
second
advance
across
the
meadow
where
the
dead
and
wounded
were
lying
thick
trimble
sending
word
to
ewell
of
his
intention
determined
to
complete
his
victory
more
skilful
than
his
enemies
he
sent
a
regiment
against
their
left
to
which
a
convenient
ravine
gave
easy
access
while
the
troops
among
the
oaks
were
held
back
till
the
flank
attack
was
fully
developed
the
unexpected
movement
completely
surprised
the
federal
brigadier
again
his
troops
were
driven
in
and
the
confederates
now
reinforced
by
six
regiments
which
ewell
had
sent
up
forced
them
with
heavy
losses
through
the
woods
compelled
two
batteries
after
a
fierce
fight
to
limber
up
routed
a
brigade
which
had
been
sent
by
fremont
to
support
the
attack
and
pressing
slowly
but
continuously
forward
threw
the
whole
of
the
enemy
left
wing
consisting
of
blenker
eleven
regiments
back
to
the
shelter
of
his
line
of
guns
trimble
had
drawn
the
bulldog
teeth
the
confederates
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
they
were
a
mile
in
advance
of
the
batteries
in
the
centre
and
the
federal
position
commanding
a
tract
of
open
ground
was
strong
in
itself
and
strongly
held
a
general
counterstroke
was
outside
the
scope
of
jackson
designs
he
had
still
shields
to
deal
with
the
federal
left
wing
had
been
heavily
repulsed
but
only
a
portion
of
force
had
been
engaged
to
press
the
attack
further
would
undoubtedly
have
cost
many
lives
and
even
a
partial
reverse
would
have
interfered
with
his
comprehensive
plan
in
other
quarters
of
the
the
fighting
had
been
unimportant
the
confederate
guns
although
heavily
outnumbered
held
their
ground
gallantly
for
more
than
five
hours
and
when
they
eventually
retired
it
was
from
want
of
ammunition
rather
than
from
loss
of
moral
the
waggons
which
carried
their
reserve
had
taken
a
wrong
road
and
at
the
critical
moment
there
were
no
means
of
replenishing
the
supply
but
so
timid
were
fremont
tactics
that
the
blunder
passed
unpunished
while
the
battle
on
the
left
was
raging
fiercely
he
had
contented
himself
elsewhere
with
tapping
feebly
at
the
enemy
lines
in
the
centre
of
the
field
his
skirmishers
moved
against
ewell
batteries
but
were
routed
by
a
bayonet
charge
on
the
right
milroy
and
schenck
the
two
generals
who
had
withstood
jackson
so
stubbornly
at
advanced
on
their
own
initiative
through
the
woods
they
had
driven
in
the
confederate
skirmishers
and
had
induced
ewell
to
strengthen
this
portion
of
his
line
from
his
reserve
when
they
were
recalled
by
fremont
alarmed
by
vigorous
attack
to
defend
the
main
position
the
southerners
followed
slowly
the
day
was
late
and
ewell
although
his
troops
were
eager
to
crown
their
victory
was
too
cool
a
soldier
to
yield
to
their
impatience
and
as
at
cedar
creek
where
also
he
had
driven
back
the
dutch
division
so
at
cross
keys
he
rendered
the
most
loyal
support
to
his
commander
yet
he
was
a
dashing
fighter
chafing
under
the
restraint
of
command
and
preferring
the
excitement
of
the
foremost
line
on
two
occasions
in
the
valley
says
general
taylor
during
the
temporary
absence
of
jackson
he
summoned
me
to
his
side
and
immediately
rushed
forward
amongst
the
skirmishers
where
sharp
work
was
going
on
having
refreshed
himself
he
returned
with
the
hope
that
old
jack
would
not
catch
him
at
it
and
reconstruction
page
how
thoroughly
jackson
trusted
his
subordinate
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
although
present
on
the
field
he
left
ewell
to
fight
his
own
battle
the
only
instructions
he
gave
showed
that
he
had
fathomed
the
temper
of
fremont
troops
let
the
federals
he
said
get
very
close
before
your
infantry
fire
they
wo
stand
long
it
was
to
ewell
dispositions
his
wise
use
of
his
reserves
and
to
trimble
ready
initiative
that
fremont
defeat
was
due
beyond
sending
up
a
couple
of
brigades
from
port
republic
jackson
gave
no
orders
his
ambition
was
of
too
lofty
a
kind
to
appropriate
the
honours
which
another
might
fairly
claim
and
when
once
battle
had
been
joined
interference
with
the
plan
on
which
it
was
being
fought
did
not
commend
itself
to
him
as
sound
generalship
he
was
not
one
of
those
suspicious
commanders
who
believe
that
no
subordinate
can
act
intelligently
if
he
demanded
the
strictest
compliance
with
his
instructions
he
was
always
content
to
leave
their
execution
to
the
judgment
of
his
generals
and
with
supreme
confidence
in
his
own
capacity
he
was
still
sensible
that
his
juniors
in
rank
might
be
just
as
able
his
supervision
was
constant
but
his
interference
rare
and
it
was
not
till
some
palpable
mistake
had
been
committed
that
he
assumed
direct
control
of
his
divisions
or
brigades
nor
was
any
peculiar
skill
needed
to
beat
back
the
attack
of
fremont
nothing
proves
the
federal
leader
want
of
confidence
more
clearly
than
the
tale
of
losses
the
confederate
casualties
amounted
to
of
which
nearly
half
occurred
in
trimble
counterstroke
the
federal
reports
show
killed
wounded
and
missing
and
of
these
riflemen
accounted
for
nearly
one
regiment
the
new
york
being
almost
annihilated
but
such
losses
although
at
one
point
severe
were
altogether
insignificant
when
compared
with
the
total
strength
and
it
was
not
the
troops
who
were
defeated
but
the
general
the
confederates
at
kernstown
lost
per
cent
the
federals
at
port
republic
per
cent
at
manassas
the
stonewall
brigade
lost
per
at
cross
keys
ewell
only
lost
per

and
fremont
per
cent
ewell
division
bivouacked
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
within
hearing
of
his
outposts
and
throughout
the
night
the
work
of
removing
the
wounded
friend
and
foe
alike
went
on
in
the
sombre
woods
there
was
work
too
at
port
republic
jackson
while
his
men
slept
was
all
activity
his
plans
were
succeeding
admirably
from
fremont
cowering
on
the
defensive
before
inferior
numbers
there
was
little
to
be
feared
it
was
unlikely
that
after
his
repulse
he
would
be
found
more
enterprising
on
the
morrow
a
small
force
would
be
sufficient
to
arrest
his
march
until
shields
had
been
crushed
and
then
swinging
back
across
the
shenandoah
the
soldiers
of
the
valley
would
find
ample
compensation
in
the
rout
of
their
most
powerful
foe
for
the
enforced
rapidity
of
their
retreat
from
winchester
but
to
fight
two
battles
in
one
day
to
disappear
completely
from
fremont
ken
and
to
recross
the
rivers
before
he
had
time
to
seize
the
bridge
were
manoeuvres
of
the
utmost
delicacy
and
needed
most
careful
preparation
it
was
jackson
custom
whenever
a
subordinate
was
to
be
entrusted
with
an
independent
mission
to
explain
the
part
that
he
was
to
play
in
a
personal
interview
by
such
means
he
made
certain
first
that
his
instructions
were
thoroughly
understood
and
second
that
there
was
no
chance
of
their
purport
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
enemy
ewell
was
first
summoned
to
headquarters
and
then
patton
whose
brigade
together
with
that
of
trimble
was
to
have
the
task
of
checking
fremont
the
next
day
i
found
him
at
says
patton
actively
engaged
in
making
his
dispositions
for
battle
he
immediately
proceeded
to
give
me
particular
instructions
as
to
the
management
of
the
men
in
covering
the
rear
saying
i
wish
you
to
throw
out
all
your
men
if
necessary
as
skirmishers
and
to
make
a
great
show
so
as
to
cause
the
enemy
to
think
the
whole
army
are
behind
you
hold
your
position
as
well
as
you
can
then
fall
back
when
obliged
take
a
new
position
hold
it
in
the
same
way
and
i
will
be
back
to
join
you
in
the
morning
colonel
patton
reminded
him
that
his
brigade
was
a
small
one
and
that
the
country
between
cross
keys
and
the
shenandoah
offered
few
advantages
for
protracting
such
manoeuvres
he
desired
therefore
to
know
for
how
long
he
would
be
expected
to
hold
the
enemy
in
check
jackson
replied
by
the
blessing
of
providence
i
hope
to
be
back
by
ten

not
the
only
business
which
occupied
the
commanding
general
he
arranged
for
the
feeding
of
his
troops
before
their
march
next
day
rations
appear
to
have
been
short
for
general
ewell
reports
that
when
he
marched
against
shields
the
next
day
many
of
his
men
had
been
without
food
for
hours
for
the
dispositions
of
his
trains
and
ammunition
waggons
and
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
which
occurred
about
midnight
he
was
seen
on
the
banks
of
the
south
river
superintending
the
construction
of
a
bridge
to
carry
his
infantry
dryshod
across
the
stream
an
hour
before
daybreak
he
was
roused
from
his
short
slumbers
major
imboden
who
was
in
charge
of
a
mule
battery
the
mule
battery
does
not
appear
to
have
done
much
more
than
afford
the
confederate
soldiers
an
opportunity
of
airing
their
wit
with
the
air
of
men
anxiously
seeking
for
information
they
would
ask
the
gunners
whether
the
mule
or
the
gun
was
intended
to
go
off
first
and
whether
the
gun
was
to
fire
the
mule
or
the
mule
the
gun
looking
for
one
of
the
staff
entered
by
mistake
the
general
room
i
opened
the
door
softly
and
discovered
jackson
lying
on
his
face
across
the
bed
fully
dressed
with
sword
sash
and
boots
all
on
the
on
the
table
shed
a
dim
light
yet
enough
by
which
to
recognise
him
i
endeavoured
to
withdraw
without
waking
him
he
turned
over
sat
upon
the
bed
and
called
out
who
is
that
he
checked
my
apology
with
that
is
all
right
it
time
to
be
up
i
am
glad
to
see
you
were
the
men
all
up
as
you
came
through
camp
yes
general
and
cooking
that
right
we
move
at
daybreak
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
had
learned
never
to
ask
him
questions
about
his
plans
for
he
would
never
answer
such
to
anyone
i
therefore
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
he
referred
very
feelingly
to
ashby
death
and
spoke
of
it
as
an
irreparable
loss
when
he
paused
i
said
general
you
made
a
glorious
of
your
four
weeks
with
yesterday
he
replied
yes
god
blessed
our
army
again
yesterday
and
i
hope
with
his
protection
and
blessing
we
shall
do
still
better

the

was
immediately
ordered
to
advance
on
the

still
dark
in
the

where
the

formed
the
outposts
the
fire
of

had
been

about
a

and
a
half
down
the
river
beyond
a
strip
of
woods
on
either
side
of
the
luray
road
they
were
quickly
driven
in
and
the
federal
position
became
revealed
from
the
of
the
blue
ridge
clothed
to
their
crests
with
and
timber
the
plain
over
a
mile
in
breadth
extended
to
the
shenandoah
the
ground
was
terraced
the
upper
level
immediately
beneath
the
mountain
was
densely
wooded
and
fifty
or
sixty
feet
above
the
open
fields
round
the
lewis
house
here
was
the
hostile
front
the
federal
force
was
composed
of
two
brigades
of
infantry
and
sixteen
guns
not
more
than
all
told
for
shields
with
the
remainder
of
the
division
was
still
far
in

the

rested
on
the
river
the
left
on
a
ravine
of
the
upper
level
through
which
a
shallow
stream
flowed
down
from
the
heights
above
on
the
northern
shoulder
of
this
ravine
was
established
a
battery
of
seven
guns
sweeping
every
yard
of
the
ground
beneath

a
country
road
which
led
directly
to
the
shenandoah
running
between
stiff
banks
and
strongly
fenced
was
lined
with

was
on
the
plain
near

with
a
section
near

on
the
hillside
beyond
the
seven
guns
two
regiments
were
concealed
within
the
forest
and
in
rear
of
the
battery
was
a
third
the
position
was
strong
and
the
men
who
held
it
were
of
different
calibre
from
blenker
germans
and
the
leaders
of
stauncher
stuff
than
fremont
six
of
the
seven
battalions
had
fought
at
kernstown
tyler
who
on
that
day
had
seen
the
confederates
retreat
before
him
was
in
command
and
neither
general
nor
soldiers
had
reason
to
dread
the
name
of
stonewall
jackson
in
the
sturdy
battalions
of
ohio
and
west
virginia
the
stonewall
brigade
were
face
to
face
with
foemen
worthy
of
their
steel
and
when
jackson
anxious
to
get
back
to
fremont
ordered
winder
to
attack
he
set
him
a
formidable
task
it
was
first
necessary
to
dislodge
the
hostile
guns
winder
two
batteries
were
insufficient
for
the
work
and
two
of
his
four
regiments
were
ordered
into
the
woods
on
the
terrace
in
order
to
outflank
the
battery
beyond
the
stream
this
detachment
moving
with
difficulty
through
the
thickets
found
a
stronger
force
of
infantry
within
the
forest
the
guns
opened
with
grape
at
a
range
of
one
hundred
yards
and
the
confederates
threatened
on
either
flank
fell
back
in
some
confusion
the
remainder
of
winder
line
had
meanwhile
met
with
a
decided
check
the
enemy
along
the
hollow
road
was
strongly
posted
both
guns
and
skirmishers
were
hidden
by
the
embankment
and
as
the
mists
of
the
morning
cleared
away
and
the
sun
rising
in
splendour
above
the
mountains
flooded
the
valley
with
light
a
long
line
of
hostile
infantry
with
colours
flying
and
gleaming
arms
was
seen
advancing
steadily
into

the
federal
commander
observing
his
opportunity
had
with
rare
good
judgment
determined
on
a
counterstroke
the
louisiana
brigade
was
moving
up
in
support
of
winder
but
it
was
still
distant
the
two
regiments
which
supported
the
confederate
batteries
were
suffering
from
the
heavy
artillery
fire
and
the
skirmishers
were
already
falling
back
below
says
general
taylor
ewell
was
hurrying
his
men
over
the
bridge
but
it
looked
as
if
we
should
be
doubled
up
on
him
ere
he
could
cross
and
develop
much
strength
jackson
was
on
the

little
in

fiercer
energy

galloping
to

although

had
now
come
up
the
enemy
fire
was
still
so
heavy
that
it
was
impossible
to
reform
the
defeated
troops
and
two
fresh
federal
regiments
were
now
advancing
to
strengthen
the
attack
tyler
had
ordered
his
left
wing
to
reinforce
the
centre
and
it
seemed
that
the
confederates
would
be
defeated
piecemeal
but
at
this
moment
the
lines
of
the
assailant
came
to
a
sudden
halt
and
along
the
slopes
of
the
blue
ridge
a
heavy
crash
of
musketry
the
rapid
discharges
of
the
guns
and
the
charging
yell
of
the
southern
infantry
told
of
a
renewed
attack
upon

mountain
side
the
louisianians
had
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
pursuing
his
march
by
the
forest
path
taylor
had
heard
the
sounds
of
battle
pass
beyond
his
flank
and
the
cheers
of
the
federals
proved
that
winder
was
hard
pressed
rapidly
deploying
on
his
advanced
guard
which
led
by
colonel
kelley
of
the
louisiana
was
already
in
line
he
led
his
companies
across
the
ravine
down
the
broken
slopes
covered
with
great
boulders
and
scattered
trees
the
men
slipped
and
stumbled
and
then
splashing
through
the
stream
swarmed
up
the
face
of
the
bank
on
which
the
federal
artillery
was
in
action
breaking
through
the
undergrowth
they
threw
themselves
on
the
guns
the
attention
of
the
enemy
had
been
fixed
upon
the
fight
that
raged
over
the
plain
below
and
the
thick
timber
and
heavy
smoke
concealed
the
approach
of
taylor
regiments
the
surprise
however
was
a
failure
the
trails
were
swung
round
in
the
new
direction
the
canister
crashed
through
the
laurels
the
supporting
infantry
rushed
forward
and
the
southerners
were
driven
back
again
as
reinforcements
crowded
over
the
ravine
they
returned
to
the
charge
and
with
bayonet
and
rammer
the
fight
surged
to
and
fro
within
the
battery
for
the
second
time
the
federals
cleared
their
front
but
some
of
the
louisiana
companies
clambering
up
the
mountain
to
the
right
appeared
upon
their
flank
and
once
more
the
stormers
rallying
in
the
hollow
rushed
forward
with
the
bayonet
the
battery
was
carried
one
gun
alone
escaping
and
the
federal
commander
saw
the
key
of
his
position
abandoned
to
the
enemy
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
the
bank
was
nearly
a
mile
in

of
his
right
and
centre

commanded
his
line
of
retreat
at
effective
range
sending
his
reserves
to
retake
the
battery
he
directed
his
attacking
line
already
pressing
heavily
on
winder
to
fall
back
at
once
but
it
was
even
then
too
late

that
he
was
only
just
in
time
jackson
horsemen
he
says
were
enveloping
the
column
a
crowd
of
fugitives
was
rushing
to
the
rear
and
his
own
cavalry
had
dispersed
the
confederate
army
of
which
some
of
the
brigades
and
nearly
the
whole
artillery
had
been
halted
far
in
rear
was
now
withdrawn
but
compelled
to
move
by
circuitous
paths
in
order
to
avoid
the
fire
of
fremont
batteries
it
was
after
midnight
before
the
whole
had
assembled
in
brown
gap
more
than
one
of
the
regiments
had
marched
over
twenty
miles
and
had
been
heavily
engaged
port
republic
was
the
battle
most
costly
to
the
army
of
the
valley
during
the
whole
campaign
out
of
confederates
engaged
were
disabled
the
troops
actually
engaged
were
as
follows
regiments
of
winder
brigade
the
louisiana
brigade
regiments
scott
brigade
regiments
virginia
virginia
artillery
batteries
cavalry
the
federal
losses
were
heavier
the
killed
wounded
and
missing
including
captured
amounted
to
or
of
strength
the
success
which
the
confederates
had
achieved
was
undoubtedly
important
the
valley
army
posted
in
brown
gap
was
now
in
direct
communication
with
richmond
not
only
had
its
pursuers
been
roughly
checked
but
the
sudden
and
unexpected
counterstroke
delivered
by
an
enemy
whom
they
believed
to
be
in
full
flight
had
surprised
lincoln
and
stanton
as
effectively
as
shields
and
fremont
on
june
the
day
jackson
halted
near
port
republic
mccall
division
of
army
corps
which
had
been
left
at
fredericksburg
had
been
sent
to
the
peninsula
by
water
and
two
days
later
mcdowell
himself
with
the
remainder
of
his
force
was
directed
to
join
mcclellan
as
speedily
as
possible
overland
fremont
on
the
same
date
was
instructed
to
halt
at
harrisonburg
and
shields
to
march
to
fredericksburg
but
before
stanton
dispatches
reached
their
destination
both
fremont
and
shields
had
been
defeated
and
the
plans
of
the
northern
cabinet
were
once
more
upset
instead
of
moving
at
once
on
fredericksburg
and
in
spite
of
mcdowell
remonstrances
shields
was
detained
at
luray
and
ricketts
who
had
succeeded
ord
at
front
royal
while
fremont
deeming
himself
too
much
exposed
at
harrisonburg
fell
back
to
mount
jackson
it
was
not
till
june
that
ricketts
and
shields
were
permitted
to
leave
the
valley
ten
days
after
the
order
had
been
issued
for
mcdowell
to
move
on
richmond
for
that
space
of
time
then
his
departure
was
delayed
and
there
was
worse
to
come
the
great
strategist
at
richmond
had
not
yet
done
with
lincoln
there
was
still
more
profit
to
be
derived
from
the
situation
and
from
the
subsidiary
operations
in
the
valley
we
may
now
turn
to
the
main
armies
by
jackson
brilliant
manoeuvres
mcdowell
had
been
lured
westward
at
the
very
moment
he
was
about
to
join
mcclellan
the
gap
between
the
two
federal
armies
had
been
widened
from
five
to
fifteen
marches
while
jackson
at
brown
gap
was
no
more
than
nine
marches
distant
from
richmond
mcclellan
moreover
had
been
paralysed
by
the
vigour
of
jackson
blows
on
may
as
already
related
he
had
reached
white
house
on
the
pamunkey
twenty
miles
from
the
confederate
capital
ten
miles
south
and
directly
across
his
path
flowed
the
chickahominy
a
formidable
obstacle
to
the
march
of
a
large
army
on
the
having
already
been
informed
that
he
was
to
be
reinforced
by
mcdowell
he
was
told
that
the
movement
of
the
latter
for
fredericksburg
was
postponed
until
the
valley
had
been
cleared
this
change
of
plan
placed
him
in
a
most
awkward
predicament
a
portion
of
his
army
in
order
to
lend
a
hand
to
mcdowell
had
already
crossed
the
chickahominy
a
river
with
but
few
points
of
passage
and
over
which
by
reason
of
the
swamps
the
construction
of
military
bridges
was
a
difficult
and
tedious
operation
on
may
two
army
corps
were
south
of
the
chickahominy
covering
in
a
partially
intrenched
position
the
building
of
the
bridges
while
three
army
corps
were
still
on
the
further
bank
mcclellan
difficulties
had
not
escaped
the
observation
of
his
watchful
adversaries
and
on
the
morning
of
may
the
federal
lines
were
heavily
attacked
by
johnston
the
left
of
the
position
on
the
south
side
of
the
chickahominy
was
protected
by
the
white
oak
swamp
a
broad
and
almost
impassable
morass
but
the
right
thrown
back
to
the
river
was
unprotected
by
intrenchments
and
thinly
manned
the
defence
of
the
first
line
had
been
assigned
to
one
corps
only
the
second
was
five
miles
in
rear
the
assailants
should
have
won
an
easy
triumph
but
if
mcclellan
had
shown
but
little
skill
in
the
distribution
of
his
troops
on
the
defensive
the
confederate
arrangements
for
attack
were
even
more
at
fault
the
country
between
richmond
and
the
chickahominy
is
level
and
well
wooded
it
was
intersected
by
several
roads
three
of
which
led
directly
to
the
enemy
position
but
the
roads
were
bad
and
a
tremendous
which
broke
on
the
night
of
the
transformed
the
fields
into
tracts
of
greasy
mud
and
rendered
the
passage
of
artillery
difficult
the
natural
obstacles
however
were
not
the
chief
the
force
detailed
for
the
attack
amounted
to
men
or
brigades
the
federal
works
were
but
five
miles
from
richmond
and
the
confederates
were
ordered
to
advance
at
dawn
but
it
was
the
first
time
that
an
offensive
movement
on
so
large
a
scale
had
been
attempted
the
woods
and
swamps
made
supervision
difficult
and
the
staff
proved
unequal
to
the
task
of
ensuring
the
orders
for
attack
were
badly
framed
the
subordinate
generals
did
not
clearly
comprehend
what
was
expected
from
them
there
were
misunderstandings
as
to
the
roads
to
be
followed
and
as
to
who
was
to
command
the
wings
the
columns
crossed
and
half
the
day
was
wasted
in
getting
into
position
it
was
not
till
that
the
first
gun
was
fired
and
not
till
that
the
commanding
general
stationed
with
the
left
wing
was
made
acquainted
with
the
progress
of
his
right
and
centre
when
it
was
at
last
delivered
the
attack
was
piecemeal
and
although
successful
in
driving
the
enemy
from
his
intrenchments
it
failed
to
drive
him
from
the
field
the
federals
fell
back
to
a
second
line
of
earthworks
and
were
strongly
reinforced
from
beyond
the
river
during
the
battle
johnston
himself
was
severely
wounded
and
the
command
devolved
on
general
smith
orders
were
issued
that
the
attack
should
be
renewed
next
morning
but
for
reasons
which
have
never
been
satisfactorily
explained
only
five
of
the
brigades
were
actively
engaged
and
the
battle
of
seven
pines
ended
with
the
unmolested
retreat
of
the
confederates
smith
fell
sick
and
general
lee
was
ordered
by
the
president
to
take
command
of
the
army
in
the
field
mcclellan
thanks
to
the
bad
work
of
the
confederate
staff
at
the
battle
of
seven
pines
had
now
succeeded
in
securing
the
passages
across
the
chickahominy
but
for
the
present
he
had
given
up
all
idea
of
an
immediate
advance
two
of
his
army
corps
had
suffered
severely
both
in
men
and
in
moral
the
roads
were
practically
impassable
for
artillery
the
bridges
over
the
chickahominy
had
been
much
injured
by
the
floods
and
it
was
imperative
to
the
communications
such
is
his
own
explanation
of
his
inactivity
but
his
official
correspondence
with
the
secretary
of
war
leaves
no
doubt
that
his
hope
of
being
reinforced
by
mcdowell
was
a
still
more
potent
reason
during
the
first
three
weeks
in
june
he
received
repeated
assurances
from
stanton
that
large
bodies
of
troops
were
on
their
way
to
join
him
and
it
was
for
these
that
he
was
waiting
this
expectant
attitude
due
to
mcdowell
entailed
on
him
a
serious
disadvantage
if
he
transferred
his
whole
army
to
the
right
bank
of
the
chickahominy
his
line
of
supply
the
railway
to
west
point
would
be
exposed
and
secondly
when
mcdowell
approached
from
fredericksburg
it
would
be
possible
for
leo
to
drive
that
general
back
before
the
army
of
the
potomac
could
give
him
direct
support
or
in
any
case
to
cut
off
all
communication
with
him
mcclellan
was
consequently
compelled
to
retain
his
right
wing
north
of
the
river
and
indeed
in
so
doing
he
was
only
obeying
his
instructions
on
may
stanton
had
telegraphed
you
are
instructed
to
so
as
to
establish
this
communication
with
mcdowell
by
extending
your
right
wing
north
of
richmond
the
federal
army
then
whilst
awaiting
the
promised
reinforcements
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
stream
which
another
storm
might
render
impassable
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
jackson
operations
not
only
deprived
mcclellan
of
the
immediate
aid
of
men
and
guns
but
placed
him
in
a
most
embarrassing
situation
the
faulty
location
of
the
union
army
says
general
porter
commanding
the
fifth
federal
army
corps
was
from
the
first
realised
by
general
mcclellan
and
became
daily
an
increasing
cause
of
care
and
anxiety
not
the
least
disturbing
element
of
which
was
the
impossibility
of
quickly
reinforcing
his
right
wing
or
promptly
withdrawing
it
to
the
south
bank
and
leaders
volume

seeing
that
the
confederates
were
no
more
than
strong
while
the
invading
army
mustered
it
would
seem
that
the
knot
should
have
been
cut
by
an
immediate
attack
on
the
richmond
lines
but
mcclellan
who
had
been
united
states
commissioner
in
the
crimea
knew
something
of
the
strength
of
earthworks
and
moreover
although
the
comparatively
feeble
numbers
developed
by
the
confederates
at
seven
pines
should
have
enlightened
him
he
still
believed
that
his
enemy
army
was
far
larger
than
his
own
so
notwithstanding
his
danger
he
preferred
to
postpone
his
advance
till
jackson
defeat
should
set
free
fatal
was
the
mistake
which
retained
mcdowell
divisions
in
the
valley
and
sent
shields
in
pursuit
of
jackson
while
the
federal
army
waiting
for
reinforcements
lay
astride
the
noisome
swamps
of
the
chickahominy
lee
was
preparing
a
counterstroke
on
the
largest
scale
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
reduce
the
disparity
of
numbers
and
to
effect
this
troops
were
to
be
brought
up
from
the
south
jackson
was
to
come
to
richmond
and
mcdowell
was
to
be
kept
away
this
last
was
of
more
importance
than
the
rest
and
at
the
same
time
more
difficult
of
attainment
jackson
was
certainly
nearer
to
richmond
than
was
mcdowell
but
to
defeat
mcclellan
would
take
some
time
and
it
was
essential
that
jackson
should
have
a
long
start
and
not
arrive
upon
the
battlefield
with
mcdowell
on
his
heels
it
was
necessary
therefore
that
the
greater
part
of
the
latter
force
should
be
detained
on
the
shenandoah
and
on
june
while
cross
keys
was
being
fought
lee

to
jackson

there
be
nothing

your
attention

few
days

you

in

well
as
in

the
admiration
excited
by
your
skill

boldness
has
been
constantly
mingled
with
solicitude
for
your
situation
the
practicability
of
reinforcing
you
has
been
the
subject

before
the

the
valley
both
fremont
and
shields
were
out
of
reach
to
have
followed
them
down
the
valley

have
been
injudicious
another
victory
would
have
doubtless
held
fast
but
it
would
have
drawn
jackson
too
far
from

the
confederate
generals
therefore
in
order
to
impose
upon
their
enemies
and
to
maintain
the
belief
that
washington
was
threatened
had
recourse
to
stratagem
the
departure
of

lawton
for
the

was
ostentatiously
announced
federal
prisoners

thus
lee
played
his
part
in
the
game
of
deception

active
measures

him

delude

only
were

debarred
from

they
became
the
unconscious
instruments

false
intelligence
was
spread
the
engineers
were
directed
to
prepare
a
series
of
maps
of

all
who
acquired
a

june
on

arrived
a
last
letter
from

from
your
account

the
position

it

be
difficult
for
you

to
unite
with
this
army
in
the

are
apparently
retrograding

shaken

disorganised
and
some

will
be

to
set

again
in

if
this
is
so
the
sooner
you
unite
with

the

sickness
in

by
far
exceed
his
losses
the
present
therefore
seems
to
be
favourable
for
a
junction
of
your
army
and
this
if
you
agree
with
me
the
sooner
you
can
make
arrangements
to
do
so
the
better
in
moving
your
troops
you
could
let
it
be
understood
that
it
was
to
pursue
the
enemy
in
your
front
dispose
those
to
hold
the
valley
so
as
to
deceive
the
enemy
keeping
your
cavalry
well
in
their
front
and
at
the
proper
time
suddenly
descending
upon
the
pamunkey
to
be
efficacious
the
movement
must
be
secret
let
me
know
the
force
you
can
bring
and
be
careful
to
guard
from
friends
and
foes
your
purpose
and
your
intention
of
personally
leaving
the
valley
the
country
is
full
of
spies
and
our
plans
are
immediately
carried
to
the
enemy
volume
part
page
the
greater
part
of
these
instructions
jackson
had
already
carried
out
on
his
own
initiative
there
remained
but
to
give
final
directions
to
colonel
munford
who
was
to
hold
the
valley
and
to
set
the
army
in
motion
munford
was
instructed
to
do
his
best
to
spread
false
reports
of
an
advance
to
the
potomac
ewell
division
was
ordered
to
charlottesville
the
rest
of
the
valley
troops
were
to
follow
ewell
and
whiting
and
lawton
who
in
order
to
bewilder
fremont
had
been
marched
from
staunton
to
mount
meridian
and
then
back
to
staunton
were
to
take
train
to
gordonsville
it
was
above
all
things
important
that
the
march
should
be
secret
not
only
was
it
essential
that
lincoln
should
not
be
alarmed
into
reinforcing
mcclellan
but
it
was
of
even
more
importance
that
mcclellan
should
not
be
alarmed
into
correcting
the
faulty
distribution
of
his
army
so
long
as
he
remained
with
half
his
force
on
one
bank
of
the
chickahominy
and
half
on
the
other
lee
had
a
fair
chance
of
concentrating
superior
numbers
against
one
of
the
fractions
but
if
mcclellan
warned
of
jackson
approach
were
to
mass
his
whole
force
on
one
bank
or
the
other
there
would
be
little
hope
of
success
for
the
confederates
the
ultimate
object
of
the
movement
was
therefore
revealed
to
no
one
and
the
most
rigorous
precautions
were
adopted
to
conceal
it
jackson
letters
from
richmond
in
accordance
with
his
own
instructions
bore
no
more
explicit
address
than
somewhere
a
long
line
of
cavalry
occupying
every
road
covered
the
front
and
prevented
anyone
soldier
or
civilian
preceding
them
toward
richmond
far
out
to
either
flank
rode
patrols
of
horsemen
and
a
strong
swept
before
it
campfollowers
and
stragglers
at
night
every
road
which
approached
the
bivouacs
was
strongly
picketed
and
the
troops
were
prevented
from
communicating
with
the
country
people
the
men
were
forbidden
to
ask
the
names
of
the
villages
through
which
they
passed
and
it
was
ordered
that
to
all
questions
they
should
make
the
one
answer
i
do
know
this
was
just
as
much
license
as
the
men
wanted
says
an
and
they
forthwith
knew
nothing
of
the
past
present
or
future
an
amusing
incident
it
is
said
grew
out
of
this
order
one
of
general
whiting
division
texans
left
the
ranks
on
the
march
and
was
climbing
a
fence
to
go
to
a
near
at
hand
when
jackson
rode
by
and
saw
him
where
are
you
going
asked
the
general
i
do
know
replied
the
soldier
to
what
command
do
you
belong
i
do
know
well
what
state
are
you
from
i
do
know
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
asked
jackson
of
another
well
was
the
reply
old
stonewall
and
general
hood
gave
orders
yesterday
that
we
were
not
to
know
anything
until
after
the
next
fight
jackson
laughed
and
rode
on
cooke
page
the
men
themselves
intelligent
as
they
were
were
unable
to
penetrate
their
general
design
when
they
reached
charlottesville
it
was
reported
in
the
ranks
that
the
next
march
would
be
northwards
to
check
a
movement
of
banks
across
the
blue
ridge
at
gordonsville
it
was
supposed
that
they
would
move
on
washington
i
recollect
says
one
of
the
valley
soldiers
that
the
pastor
of
the
presbyterian
church
there
with
whom
jackson
spent
the
night
told
me
as
a
profound
secret
not
to
be
breathed
to
mortal
man
that
we
would
move
at
daybreak
on
culpeper
court
house
to
intercept
a
column
of
the
enemy
coming
across
the
mountains
he
said
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
this
for
he
had
it
from
general
jackson
himself
we
did
move
at
daybreak
but
instead
of
moving
on
culpeper
court
house
we
marched
in
the
opposite
direction
at
hanover
junction
we
expected
to
head
towards
fredericksburg
to
meet
mcdowell
and
the
whole
movement
was
so
secretly
conducted
that
the
troops
were
uncertain
of
their
destination
until
the
evening
of
june
when
they
heard
hill
guns
at
mechanicsville
and
made
the
woods
vibrate
with
their
shouts
of
anticipated
victory
communicated
by
the
reverend
jones
at
gordonsville
a
rumour
which
proved
to
be
false
arrested
the
march
of
the
army
for
a
whole
day
on
the
the
leading
division
arrived
at
frederickshall
fifty
miles
from
richmond
and
there
halted
for
the
sunday
they
had
already
marched
fifty
miles
and
the
main
body
although
the
railway
had
been
of
much
service
was
still
distant
there
was
not
sufficient
rolling
stock
available
to
transport
all
the
infantry
simultaneously
and
in
any
case
the
cavalry
artillery
and
waggons
must
have
proceeded
by
road
the
trains
therefore
moving
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
line
and
taking
up
the
rear
brigades
in
succession
forwarded
them
in
a
couple
of
hours
a
whole
day
march
beyond
frederickshall
the
line
had
been
destroyed
by
the
enemy
cavalry
at
on
monday
morning
jackson
accompanied
by
a
single
orderly
rode
to
confer
with
lee
near
richmond
june
he
was
provided
with
a
pass
which
major
dabney
had
been
instructed
to
procure
from
general
whiting
the
next
in
command
authorising
him
to
impress
horses
and
he
had
resorted
to
other
expedients
to
blind
his
friends
the
lady
of
the
house
which
he
had
made
his
headquarters
at
frederickshall
had
sent
to
ask
if
the
general
would
breakfast
with
her
next
morning
he
replied
that
he
would
be
glad
to
do
so
if
he
were
there
at
breakfast
time
and
upon
her
inquiry
as
to
the
time
that
would
be
most
convenient
he
said
have
it
at
your
usual
time
and
send
for
me
when
it
is
ready
when
harris
sent
for
him
jim
his
coloured
servant
replied
to
the
message
sh
you
to
find
the
general
here
at
this
hour
do
you
he
left
here
midnight
and
i
by
this
time
he
whippin
banks
in
the
valley
during
the
journey
his
determination
to
preserve
his
incognito
was
the
cause
of
some
embarrassment
a
few
miles
from
his
quarters
he
was
halted
by
a
sentry
it
was
in
vain
that
he
represented
that
he
was
an
officer
on
duty
carrying
dispatches
the
sentry
one
of
the
stonewall
brigade
was
inexorable
and
quoted
jackson
own
orders
the
utmost
that
he
would
concede
was
that
the
commander
of
the
picket
should
be
called
when
this
officer
came
he
recognised
his
general
jackson
bound
them
both
to
secrecy
and
praising
the
soldier
for
his
obedience
continued
his
ride
some
hours
later
his
horse
broke
down
proceeding
to
a
plantation
near
the
road
he
told
his
orderly
to
request
that
a
couple
of
horses
might
be
supplied
for
an
officer
on
important
duty
it
was
still
dark
and
the
indignant
proprietor
so
unceremoniously
disturbed
by
two
unknown
soldiers
who
declined
to
give
their
names
refused
all
aid
after
some
parley
jackson
and
his
orderly
finding
argument
wasted
proceeded
to
the
stables
selected
the
two
best
horses
shifted
the
saddles
and
left
their
own
chargers
as
a
temporary
exchange
at
three
in
the
afternoon
after
passing
rapidly
through
richmond
he
reached
the
headquarters
of
the
it
is
unfortunate
that
no
record
of
the
meeting
that
took
place
has
been
preserved
there
were
present
besides
lee
and
jackson
the
three
officers
whose
divisions
were
to
be
employed
in
the
attack
upon
the
federals
longstreet
hill
and
hill
the
names
of
the
two
former
are
associated
with
almost
every
confederate
victory
won
upon
the
soil
of
virginia
they
were
trusted
by
their
great
leader
and
they
were
idolised
by
their
men
like
others
they
made
mistakes
the
one
was
sometimes
slow
the
other
careless
neither
gave
the
slightest
sign
that
they
were
capable
of
independent
command
and
both
were
at
times
impatient
of
control
but
taking
them
all
in
all
they
were
gallant
soldiers
brave
to
a
fault
vigorous
in
attack
and
undaunted
by
adverse
fortune
longstreet
sturdy
and
sedate
his
old
as
lee
affectionately
called
him
bore
on
his
broad
shoulders
the
weight
of
twenty
years
service
in
the
old
army
slight
figure
and
delicate
features
instinct
with
life
and
energy
were
a
marked
contrast
to
the
heavier
frame
and
rugged
lineaments
of
his
older
colleague
already
they
were
distinguished
in
the
hottest
of
the
fight
they
had
won
the
respect
that
soldiers
so
readily
accord
to
valour
yet
it
is
not
on
these
stubborn
fighters
not
on
their
companion
less
popular
but
hardly
less
capable
that
the
eye
of
imagination
rests
were
some
great
painter
gifted
with
the
sense
of
historic
fitness
to
place
on
his
canvas
the
council
in
the
virginia
homestead
two
figures
only
would
occupy
the
foreground
the
one
weary
with
travel
white
with
the
dust
of
many
leagues
and
bearing
on
his
frayed
habiliments
the
traces
of
rough
bivouacs
and
mountain
roads
the
other
tall
straight
and
stately
still
for
all
his
fifty
years
remarkable
for
his
personal
beauty
and
endowed
with
all
the
simple
dignity
of
a
noble
character
and
commanding
intellect
in
that
humble
chamber
where
the
only
refreshment
the
could
offer
was
a
glass
of
milk
lee
and
jackson
met
for
the
first
time
since
the
war
had
begun
lee
hours
of
triumph
had
yet
to
come
the
south
was
aware
that
he
was
sage
in
council
he
had
yet
to
prove
his
mettle
in
the
field
but
there
was
at
least
one
virginia
soldier
who
knew
his
worth
with
the
prescient
sympathy
of
a
kindred
spirit
jackson
had
divined
his
daring
and
his
genius
and
although
he
held
always
to
his
own
opinions
he
had
no
will
but
that
of
his
great
commander
with
how
absolute
a
trust
his
devotion
was
repaid
one
of
the
brightest
pages
in
the
history
of
virginia
tells
us
a
year
crowded
with
victories
bears
witness
to
the
strength
begotten
of
their
mutual
confidence
so
long
as
lee
and
jackson
led
her
armies
hope
shone
on
the
standards
of
the
south
great
was
the
constancy
of
her
people
wonderful
the
fortitude
of
her
soldiers
but
on
the
shoulders
of
her
twin
heroes
rested
the
burden
of
the
tremendous
struggle
to
his
four
lee
explained
his
plan
of
attack
and
then
retiring
to
his
office
left
them
to
arrange
the
details
it
will
be
sufficient
for
the
present
to
state
that
jackson
troops
were
to
encamp
on
the
night
of
the
east
of
ashland
fifteen
miles
north
of
richmond
between
the
village
and
the
virginia
central
railway
the
day
following
the
interview
the
he
returned
to
his
command
rejoining
the
column
at
beaver
dam
station
june
his
advanced
guard
were
now
within
forty
miles
of
richmond
and
so
far
from
mcdowell
being
on
his
heels
that
general
was
still
north
of
fredericksburg
no
reinforcements
could
reach
mcclellan
for
several
days
the
confederates
were
concentrated
round
richmond
in
full
strength
and
lee
strategy
had
been
entirely
successful
moreover
with
such
skill
had
jackson
march
been
made
that
the
federal
generals
were
absolutely
ignorant
of
his
whereabouts
mcclellan
indeed
seems
to
have
had
some
vague
suspicion
of
his
approach
but
lincoln
mcdowell
banks
fremont
together
with
the
whole
of
the
northern
people
and
the
northern
press
believed
that
he
was
still
west
of
gordonsville
neither
scout
spy
nor
patrol
was
able
to
penetrate
the
cordon
of
munford
outposts
beyond
his
pickets
strongly
posted
at
new
market
and
conrad
store
all
was
dim
and
dark
had
jackson
halted
awaiting
reinforcements
was
he
already
in
motion
marching
swiftly
and
secretly
against
some
isolated
garrison
was
he
planning
another
dash
on
washington
this
time
with
a
larger
army
at
his
back
would
his
advance
be
east
or
west
of
the
blue
ridge
across
the
sources
of
the
rappahannock
or
through
the
alleghanies
had
he
men
or
such
were
the
questions
which
obtruded
themselves
on
the
federal
generals
and
not
one
could
give
a
satisfactory
reply
that
a
blow
was
preparing
and
that
it
would
fall
where
it
was
least
expected
all
men
knew
we
have
a
determined
and
enterprising
enemy
to
contend
with
wrote
one
of
lincoln
generals
jackson
said
another
marches
thirty
miles
a
day
the
successive
surprises
of
the
valley
campaign
had
left
their
mark
and
the
correspondence
preserved
in
the
official
records
is
in
itself
the
highest
tribute
to
jackson
skill
he
had
gained
something
more
than
the
respect
of
his
enemies
he
had
brought
them
to
fear
his
name
and
from
the
potomac
to
the
rappahannock
uncertainty
and
apprehension
reigned
supreme
not
a
patrol
was
sent
out
which
did
not
expect
to
meet
the
confederate
columns
pressing
swiftly
northward
not
a
general
along
the
whole
line
from
romney
to
fredericksburg
who
did
not
tremble
for
his
own
security
there
was
sore
trouble
on
the
shenandoah
the
disasters
of
and
front
royal
had
taught
the
federal
officers
that
when
the
valley
army
was
reported
to
be
sixty
miles
distant
it
was
probably
deploying
in
the
nearest
forest
and
with
the
rout
of
winchester
still
fresh
in
their
memories
they
knew
that
pursuit
would
be
as
vigorous
as
attack
would
be
sudden
the
air
was
full
of
rumours
each
more
alarming
than
its
predecessor
and
all
of
them
contradictory
the
reports
of
the
cavalry
of
spies
of
prisoners
of
deserters
of
escaped
negroes
told
each
a
different
story
jackson
it
was
at
first
reported
had
been
reinforced
to
the
number
of
men
the
telegrams
and
letters
containing
the
reports
quoted
on
pages
are
to
be
found
in
volume
part
and
volume
part
a
few
days
later
his
army
had
swelled
to
with
guns
and
he
was
rebuilding
the
bridge
at
port
republic
in
order
to
follow
fremont
on
june
he
was
believed
to
be
moving
through
charlottesville
against
one
or
other
of
mcdowell
divisions
he
was
either
going
against
shields
at
luray
or
king
at
catlett
or
doubleday
at
fredericksburg
or
going
to
richmond
on
the
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
he
was
within
striking
distance
of
front
royal
on
the
he
had
gone
to
richmond
but
ewell
was
still
in
the
valley
with
men
on
the
banks
had
no
doubt
but
that
another
immediate
movement
down
the
valley
was
intended
with
or
more
on
the
jackson
was
said
to
be
moving
on
warrenton
east
of
the
blue
ridge
on
the
reliable
persons
at
ferry
had
learned
that
he
was
about
to
attack
banks
at
middletown
and
on
the
same
day
ewell
who
was
actually
near
frederickshall
was
discovered
to
be
moving
on
moorefield
on
the
fremont
had
been
informed
that
large
reinforcements
had
reached
jackson
from
tennessee
and
banks
was
on
the
watch
for
a
movement
from
the
west
fremont
heard
that
ewell
designed
to
attack
winchester
in
rear
and
the
threat
from
so
dangerous
a
quarter
made
lincoln
anxious
we
have
no
definite
information
wrote
stanton
to
mcclellan
as
to
the
numbers
or
position
of
jackson
force
within
the
last
two
days
the
evidence
is
strong
that
for
some
purpose
the
enemy
is
circulating
rumours
of
jackson
advance
in
various
directions
with
a
view
to
conceal
the
real
point
of
attack
neither
mcdowell
nor
banks
nor
fremont
appear
to
have
any
accurate
knowledge
of
the
subject
this
was
on
june
the
day
the
valley
army
halted
at
ashland
but
the
climax
was
reached
on
the
for
hours
jackson
had
been
fighting
mcclellan
yet

although
quite
confident
that
he
was
not
within
thirty
miles
believed
that
he
was
preparing
for
an
attack

middletown
to
reach
middletown
jackson
would
have
had
to
march
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
under
the
influence
of
these
rumours
the
movements
of
the
federal
troops
were
erratic
in
the
extreme
fremont
who
had
originally
been
ordered
to
remain
at
harrisonburg
had
fallen
back
on
banks
at
middletown
although
ordered
to
front
royal
was
most
reluctant
to
move
so
far
south
shields
was
first
ordered
to
stand
fast
at
luray
where
he
would
be
reinforced
by
ricketts
and
was
then
ordered
to
fall
back
on
front
royal
reinforcements
were
ordered
to
romney
to
harper
ferry
and
to
winchester
and
mcdowell
who
kept
his
head
throughout
struggled
in
vain
to
reunite
his
scattered
divisions
divining
the
true
drift
of
the
confederate
strategy
he
realised
that
to
protect
washington
and
to
rescue
mcclellan
the
surest
method
was
for
his
own
army
corps
to
march
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
chickahominy
but
his
pleadings
were
disregarded
lincoln
and
stanton
had
not
yet
discovered
that
the
best
defence
is
generally
a
vigorous
attack
they
had
learned
nothing
from
the
valley
campaign
and
they
were
infected
with
the
fears
of
banks
and
fremont
jackson
was
well
on
his
way
to
richmond
before
shields
and
ricketts
were
permitted
to
cross
the
blue
ridge
and
it
was
not
till
the
that
mcdowell
corps
was
once
more
concentrated
at
fredericksburg
the
confederates
had
gained
a
start
of
five
marches
and
the
northern
government
was
still
ignorant
that
they
had
left
the
valley
mcclellan
was
equally
in
the
dark
faint
rumours
had
preceded
the
march
of
jackson
army
but
he
had
given
them
scant
credit
on
the
morning
of
the
however
he
was
rudely
enlightened
it
was
but
too
clear
that
jackson
strongly
reinforced
from
richmond
was
bearing
down
upon
his
most
vulnerable
point
his
right
wing
which
in
anticipation
of
mcdowell
advance
remained
exposed
on
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
nor
was
this
the
sum
of
his
troubles
on
this
same
day
when
his
outposts
were
falling
back
before
superior
numbers
and
the
valley
regiments
were
closing
round
their
flank
he
received
a
telegram
from
stanton
informing
him
that
the
forces
commanded
by
mcdowell
banks
and
fremont
were
to
form
one
army
under
pope
and
that
this
army
was
to
attack
and
overcome
the
rebel
forces
under
jackson
and
ewell
and
threaten
the
enemy
in
the
direction
of
charlottesville
all
hope
of
succour
passed
away
and
the
young
napoleon
was
left
to
extricate
himself
as
best
he
could
from
his
many
difficulties
difficulties
which
were
due
in
part
to
his
own
political
blindness
in
part
to
the
ignorance
of
lincoln
but
in
a
far
larger
degree
to

review
of

in

more
than
federals
were
prepared
to
invade
virginia
mcclellan
before
mcdowell
was
withheld
reckoned
on
placing
men
at
west
point
fremont
in
west
virginia
commanded
including
the
force
in
the
kanawha
valley
and
banks
had
crossed
the
potomac
with
over
less
than
confederate
soldiers
were
available
to
oppose
this
enormous
host
and
the
numerical
disproportion
was
increased
by
the
vast
material
resources
of
the
north
the
only
advantages
which
the
southerners
possessed
were
that
they
were
operating
in
their
own
country
and
that
their
cavalry
was
the
more
efficient
their
leaders
therefore
could
count
on
receiving
more
ample
and
more
accurate
information
than
their
adversaries
if
i
were
mindful
only
of
my
own
glory
i
would
choose
always
to
make
war
in
my
own
country
for
there
every
man
is
a
spy
and
the
enemy
can
make
no
movement
of
which
i
am
not
informed
frederick
the
instructions
to
his
generals
but
except
in
these
respects
everything
was
against
them
in
mettle
and
in
discipline
the
troops
were
fairly
matched
on
both
sides
the
higher
commands
with
few
exceptions
were
held
by
regular
officers
who
had
received
the
same
training
on
both
sides
the
staff
was
inexperienced
if
the
confederate
infantry
were
better
marksmen
than
the
majority
of
the
federals
they
were
not
so
well
armed
and
the
federal
artillery
both
in
materiel
and
in
handling
was
the
more
efficient
the
odds
against
the
south
were
great
and
to
those
who
believed
that
providence
sides
with
the
big
battalions
that
numbers
armament
discipline
and
tactical
efficiency
are
all
that
is
required
to
ensure
success
the
fall
of
richmond
must
have
seemed
inevitable
but
within
three
months
of
the
day
that
mcclellan
started
for
the
peninsula
the
odds
had
been
much
reduced
the
confederates
had
won
no
startling
victories
except
in
the
valley
and
there
only
small
detachments
were
concerned
the
fighting
had
been
indecisive
the
north
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
her
soldiers
save
only
the
cavalry
were
in
any
way
inferior
to
their
adversaries
and
yet
on
june
where
were
the
big
battalions
men
were
intrenched
within
sight
of
the
spires
of
richmond
but
where
were
the
rest
where
were
the
at
the
date
of
the
action
at
front
royal
may
the
following
was
the
strength
of
the
detached
forces
banks
fremont
mcdowell
including
shields
but
excluding
mccall
that
should
have
aided
mcclellan
have
encircled
the
rebel
capital
on
every
side
cut
the
communications
closed
the
sources
of
supply
and
have
overwhelmed
the
starving
garrison
how
came
it
that
fremont
and
banks
were
no
further
south
than
they
were
in
march
that
the
shenandoah
valley
still
poured
its
produce
into
richmond
that
mcdowell
had
not
yet
crossed
the
rappahannock
what
mysterious
power
had
compelled
lincoln
to
retain
a
force
larger
than
the
whole
confederate
army
to
protect
the
national
capital
from
danger
and
insult
it
was
not
hard
fighting
the
valley
campaign
from
kernstown
to
port
republic
had
not
cost
the
federals
more
than
men
and
with
the
exception
of
cross
keys
the
battles
had
been
well
contested
it
was
not
the
difficulties
of
supply
or
movement
it
was
not
absence
of
information
for
until
jackson
vanished
from
the
sight
of
both
friend
and
foe
on
june
spies
and
contrabands
fugitive
slaves
had
done
good
work
the
blacks
however
appear
to
have
been
as
unreliable
as
regards
numbers
as
mcclellan
detectives
if
a
negro
were
asked
how
many
confederates
he
had
seen
at
a
certain
point
his
answer
was
very
likely
to
be
i
dunno
massa
but
i
guess
about
a
million
mcclellan
own
story
page
nor
was
it
want
of
will
on
the
part
of
the
northern
government
none
were
more
anxious
than
lincoln
and
stanton
to
capture
richmond
to
disperse
the
rebels
and
to
restore
the
union
they
had
made
stupendous
efforts
to
organise
a
sufficient
army
to
equip
that
army
as
no
army
had
ever
been
equipped
before
they
had
spared
neither
expense
nor
labour
and
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
they
had
created
a
vast
machine
perhaps
in
part
imperfect
but
considering
the
weakness
of
the
enemy
not
for
the
work
before
it
there
was
but
one
thing
they
had
overlooked
and
that
was
that
their
host
would
require
intelligent
control
so
complete
was
the
mechanism
so
simple
a
matter
it
appeared
to
set
the
machine
in
motion
and
to
keep
it
in
the
right
course
that
they
believed
that
their
untutored
hands
guided
by
and
sound
abilities
were
perfectly
capable
of
guiding
it
without
mishap
to
the
appointed
goal
men
who
aware
of
their
ignorance
would
probably
have
shrunk
from
assuming
charge
of
a
squad
of
infantry
in
action
had
no
hesitation
whatever
in
attempting
to
direct
a
mighty
army
a
task
which
napoleon
has
assured
us
requires
profound
study
incessant
application
and
wide
experience
in
consequence
of
the
excessive
growth
of
armies
tactics
have
lost
in
weight
and
the
strategical
design
rather
than
the
detail
of
the
movements
has
become
the
decisive
factor
in
the
issue
at
a
campaign
the
strategical
design
depends
as
a
rule
upon
the
decision
of
cabinets
and
upon
the
resources
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
commander
consequently
either
the
leading
statesmen
should
have
correct
views
of
the
science
of
war
or
should
make
up
for
their
ignorance
by
giving
their
entire
confidence
to
the
man
to
whom
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
is
entrusted
otherwise
the
germs
of
defeat
and
national
ruin
may
be
contained
in
the
first
preparations
for
war
the
archduke
charles
of
austria
they
were
in
fact
ignorant
and
how
many
statesmen
and
even
soldiers
are
in
like
case
that
strategy
the
art
of
manoeuvring
armies
is
an
art
in
itself
an
art
which
none
may
master
by
the
light
of
nature
but
to
which
if
he
is
to
attain
success
a
man
must
serve
a
long
apprenticeship
the
rules
of
strategy
are
few
and
simple
they
may
be
learned
in
a
week
they
may
be
taught
by
familiar
illustrations
or
a
dozen
diagrams
but
such
knowledge
will
no
more
teach
a
man
to
lead
an
army
like
napoleon
than
a
knowledge
of
grammar
will
teach
him
to
write
like
gibbon
lincoln
when
the
army
he
had
so
zealously
toiled
to
organise
reeled
back
in
confusion
from
virginia
set
himself
to
learn
the
art
of
war
he
collected
says
his
biographer
a
great
library
of
military
books
and
if
it
were
not
pathetic
it
would
be
almost
ludicrous
to
read
of
the
great
president
in
the
midst
of
his
absorbing
labours
and
his
anxieties
poring
night
after
night
when
his
capital
was
asleep
over
the
pages
of
jomini
and
clausewitz
and
what
was
the
result
in
when
grant
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
union
armies
he
said
i
neither
ask
nor
desire
to
know
anything
of
your
plans
take
the
responsibility
and
act
and
call
on
me
for
assistance
he
had
learned
at
last
that
no
man
is
a
born
strategist
the
mistakes
of
lincoln
and
stanton
are
not
to
be
condoned
by
pointing
to
mcclellan
mcclellan
designed
the
plan
for
the
invasion
of
virginia
and
the
plan
failed
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
plan
was
in
itself
a
bad
one
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
would
have
succeeded
in
many
respects
it
was
admirable
it
did
away
with
a
long
line
of
land
communications
passing
through
a
hostile
country
it
brought
the
naval
power
of
the
federals
into
combination
with
the
military
it
secured
two
great
waterways
the
york
and
the
james
by
which
the
army
could
be
easily
supplied
which
required
no
guards
and
by
which
heavy
ordnance
could
be
brought
up
to
bombard
the
fortifications
of
richmond
but
it
had
one
flaw
it
left
washington
in
the
opinion
of
the
president
and
of
the
nation
insecure
and
this
flaw
which
would
have
escaped
the
notice
of
an
ordinary
enemy
was
at
once
detected
by
lee
and
jackson
moreover
had
mcclellan
been
left
in
control
of
the
whole
theatre
of
war
jackson
manoeuvres
would
probably
have
failed
to
produce
so
decisive
an
effect
the
fight
at
kernstown
would
not
have
induced
mcclellan
to
strike
men
off
the
strength
of
the
invading
army
he
had
not
been
deceived
when
jackson
threatened
harper
ferry
at
the
end
of
may
the
reinforcements
sent
from
richmond
after
port
republic
had
not
blinded
him
nor
did
he
for
a
moment
believe
that
washington
was
in
actual
danger
there
is
this
however
to
be
said
had
mcclellan
been
in
sole
command
public
opinion
alarmed
for
washington
would
have
possibly
compelled
him
to
do
exactly
what
lincoln
did
and
to
retain
nearly
half
the
army
on
the
potomac
so
much
for
the
leading
of
civilians
on
the
other
hand
the
failure
of
the
federals
to
concentrate
more
than
men
at
the
decisive
point
and
even
to
establish
those
in
a
favourable
position
was
mainly
due
to
the
superior
strategy
of
the
confederates
those
were
indeed
skilful
manoeuvres
which
prevented
mcdowell
from
marching
to
the
chickahominy
and
at
the
critical
moment
when
lee
was
on
the
point
of
attacking
mcclellan
which
drew
mcdowell
banks
and
fremont
on
a
chase
towards
charlottesville
the
weak
joint
in
the
enemy
armour
the
national
anxiety
for
washington
was
early
recognised
kernstown
induced
lincoln
departing
from
the
original
scheme
of
operations
to
form
four
independent
armies
each
acting
on
a
different
line
two
months
later
when
mcclellan
was
near
richmond
it
was
of
essential
importance
that
the
move
of
these
armies
should
be
combined
jackson
once
more
intervened
banks
was
driven
across
the
potomac
and
again
the
federal
concentration
was
postponed
lastly
the
battles
of
cross
keys
and
port
republic
followed
by
the
dispatch
of
whiting
and
lawton
to
the
valley
led
the
northern
president
to
commit
his
worst
mistake
for
the
second
time
the
plan
of
campaign
was
changed
and
mcclellan
was
left
isolated
at
the
moment
he
most
needed
help
the
brains
of
two
great
leaders
had
done
more
for
the
confederacy
than
soldiers
had
done
for
the
union
without
quitting
his
desk
and
leaving
the
execution
of
his
plans
to
jackson
lee
had
relieved
richmond
of
the
pressure
of
federals
and
had
lured
the
remainder
into
the
position
he
most
wished
to
find
them
the
confederacy
notwithstanding
the
enormous
disparity
of
force
had
once
more
gained
the
upper
hand
and
from
this
instance
as
from
a
score
of
others
it
may
be
deduced
that
providence
is
more
inclined
to
side
with
the
big
brains
than
with
the
big
battalions
it
was
not
mere
natural
ability
that
had
triumphed
lee
in
this
respect
was
assuredly
not
more
highly
gifted
than
lincoln
or
jackson
than
mcclellan
but
whether
by
accident
or
design
davis
had
selected
for
command
of
the
confederate
army
and
had
retained
in
the
valley
two
past
masters
in
the
art
of
strategy
if
it
was
accident
he
was
singularly
favoured
by
fortune
he
might
have
selected
many
soldiers
of
high
rank
and
long
service
who
would
have
been
as
innocent
of
strategical
skill
as
lincoln
himself
his
choice
might
have
fallen
on
the
most
dashing
leader
the
strictest
disciplinarian
the
best
drill
in
the
confederate
army
and
yet
the
man
who
united
all
these
qualities
might
have
been
altogether
ignorant
of
the
higher
art
of
war
davis
himself
had
been
a
soldier
he
was
a
graduate
of
west
point
and
in
the
mexican
campaign
he
had
commanded
a
volunteer
regiment
with
much
distinction
but
as
a
director
of
military
operations
he
was
a
greater
marplot
than
even
stanton
it
by
no
means
follows
that
because
a
man
has
lived
his
life
in
camp
and
barrack
has
long
experience
of
command
and
even
long
experience
of
war
that
he
can
apply
the
rules
of
strategy
before
the
enemy
in
the
first
place
he
may
lack
the
character
the
inflexible
resolution
the
broad
grasp
the
vivid
imagination
the
power
of
patient
thought
the
cool
head
and
above
all
the
moral
courage
in
the
second
place
there
are
few
schools
where
strategy
may
be
learned
and
in
any
case
a
long
and
laborious
course
of
study
is
the
only
means
of
acquiring
the
capacity
to
handle
armies
and
outwit
an
equal
adversary
the
light
of
alone
is
insufficient
nor
will
a
few
months
reading
give
more
than
a
smattering
of
knowledge
read
and
said
napoleon
the
campaigns
of
alexander
hannibal
caesar
gustavus
turenne
eugene
and
frederick
take
them
as
your
models
for
it
is
the
only
means
of
becoming
a
great
leader
and
of
mastering
the
secrets
of
the
art
of
war
your
intelligence
enlightened
by
such
study
will
then
reject
methods
contrary
to
those
adopted
by
these
great
men
in
america
as
elsewhere
it
had
not
been
recognised
before
the
civil
war
even
by
the
military
authorities
that
if
armies
are
to
be
handled
with
success
they
must
be
directed
by
trained
strategists
no
kriegsakademie
or
its
equivalent
existed
in
the
united
states
and
the
officers
whom
induced
to
follow
the
advice
of
napoleon
had
to
pursue
their
studies
by
themselves
to

campaigns

an
epitome
of
all
that
had
gone
before
the
campaigns
of
washington
explained
how
the
principles
of
the
art
might
be
best
applied
to
their
own
country
and
mexico
had
supplied
them
with
practical
experience
of
the
west
point
graduates
there
were
many
who
had
acquired
from
these
sources
a
wide
knowledge
of
the
art
of
generalship
and
among
them
were
no
more
earnest
students
than
the
three
virginians
lee
jackson
and
johnston
when
jackson
accepted
an
appointment
for
the
military
institute
it
was
with
the
avowed
intention
of
training
his
intellect
for
war
in
his
retirement
at
lexington
he
had
kept
before
his
eyes
the
possibility
that
he
might
some
day
be
recalled
to
the
army
he
had
already
acquired
such
practical
knowledge
of
his
profession
as
the
united
states
service
could
afford
he
had
become
familiar
with
the
characteristics
of
the
regular
soldier
he
knew
how
to
command
to
maintain
discipline
and
the
regulations
were
at
his
fingers
ends
a
few
years
had
been
sufficient
to
teach
him
all
that
could
be
learned
from
the
routine
of
a
regiment
as
they
had
been
sufficient
to
teach
napoleon
frederick
and
lee
but
there
remained
over
and
above
the
intellectual
part
of
war
and
with
characteristic
thoroughness
he
had
set
himself
to
master
it
his
reward
came
quickly
the
valley
campaign
practically
saved
richmond
in
a
few
short
months
the
quiet
gentleman
of
lexington
became
in
the
estimation
of
both
friend
and
foe
a
very
thunderbolt
of
war
and
his
name
which
a
year
previous
had
hardly
been
known
beyond
the
valley
was
already
famous
it
is
perhaps
true
that
johnston
and
lee
had
a
larger
share
in
jackson
success
than
has
been
generally
recognised
it
was
due
to
johnston
that
jackson
was
retained
in
the
valley
when
mcclellan
moved
to
the
peninsula
and
his
too
was
the
fundamental
idea
of
the
campaign
that
the
federals
in
the
valley
were
to
be
prevented
from
reinforcing
the
army
which
threatened
richmond
to
lee
belongs
still
further
credit
from
the
moment
he
assumed
command
we
find
the
confederate
operations
directed
on
a
definite
and
plan
a
defensive
attitude
round
richmond
a
vigorous
offensive
in
the
valley
leading
to
the
dispersion
of
the
enemy
and
a
confederate
concentration
on
the
chickahominy
his
operations
were
very
bold
when
mcclellan
with
far
superior
numbers
was
already
within
twenty
miles
of
richmond
he
had
permitted
jackson
to
retain
ewell
in
the
valley
and
he
would
have
given
him
the
brigades
of
branch
and
mahone
from
lee
too
came
the
suggestion
that
a
blow
should
be
struck
at
banks
that
he
should
be
driven
back
to
the
potomac
and
that
the
north
should
be
threatened
with
invasion
from
him
too
at
a
moment
when
mcclellan
breastworks
could
be
actually
seen
from
richmond
came
the
men
under
whiting
and
lawton
the
news
of
whose
arrival
in
the
valley
had
spread
such
consternation
amongst
the
federals
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
jackson
viewed
the
situation
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
his
superiors
the
instructions
he
received
were
exactly
the
instructions
he
would
have
given
had
he
been
in
command
at
richmond
and
it
may
be
questioned
whether
even
he
would
have
carried
them
out
with
such
vigour
if
he
had
not
thoroughly
agreed
with
every
detail
lee
strategy
was
indeed
remarkable
he
knew
mcclellan
and
he
knew
lincoln
he
knew
that
the
former
was
he
knew
that
the
latter
was
no
sudden
assault
on
the
richmond
lines
weak
as
they
were
was
to
be
apprehended
and
a
threat
against
washington
was
certain
to
have
great
results
hence
the
audacity
which
at
a
moment
apparently
most
critical
sent
of
the
best
troops
in
the
confederacy
as
far
northward
as
harper
ferry
and
a
fortnight
later
weakened
the
garrison
of
richmond
by
infantry
he
was
surely
a
great
leader
who
in
the
face
of
an
overwhelming
enemy
dared
assume
so
vast
a
responsibility
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
lee
made
no
suggestion
whatever
as
to
the
manner
in
which
his
ideas
were
to
be
worked
out
everything
was
left
to
jackson
the
swift
manoeuvres
which
surprised
in
succession
his
various
enemies
emanated
from
himself
alone
it
was
his
brain
that
conceived
the
march
by
mechum
station
to
the
march
that
surprised
fremont
and
bewildered
banks
it
was
his
brain
that
conceived
the
rapid
transfer
of
the
valley
army
from
the
one
side
of
the
massanuttons
to
the
other
the
march
that
surprised
kenly
and
drove
banks
in
panic
to
the
potomac
it
was
his
brain
that
conceived
the
double
victory
of
cross
keys
and
port
republic
and
if
strategy
was
brilliant
that
displayed
by
jackson
on
the
minor
theatre
of
war
was
no
less
masterly
the
instructions
he
received
at
the
end
of
april
before
he
moved
against
milroy
were
simply
to
the
effect
that
a
successful
blow
at
banks
might
have
the
happiest
results
but
such
a
blow
was
not
easy
banks
was
strongly
posted
and
numerically
superior
to
jackson
while
fremont
in
equal
strength
was
threatening
staunton
taking
instant
advantage
of
the
separation
of
the
hostile
columns
jackson
struck
at
milroy
and
having
checked
fremont
returned
to
the
valley
to
find
banks
retreating
at
this
moment
he
received
orders
from
lee
to
threaten
washington
without
an
instant
hesitation
he
marched
northward
by
may
had
the
federals
received
warning
of
his
advance
they
might
have
concentrated
men
at
strasburg
and
front
royal
or
while
banks
was
reinforced
mcdowell
might
have
moved
on
gordonsville
cutting
jackson
line
of
retreat
on
richmond
but
jackson
took
as
little
count
of
numbers
as
did
cromwell
concealing
his
march
with
his
usual
skill
he
dashed
with
his
men
into
the
midst
of
his
enemies
driving
banks
before
him
and
well
aware
that
fremont
and
mcdowell
were
converging
in
his
rear
he
advanced
boldly
on
harper
ferry
routed
saxton
outposts
and
remained
for
two
days
on
the
potomac
with
federals
within
a
few
days
march
then
retreating
rapidly
up
the
valley
beneath
the
southern
peaks
of
the
massanuttons
he
turned
fiercely
at
bay
and
the
pursuing
columns
mustering
together
nearly
twice
his
numbers
were
thrust
back
with
heavy
loss
at
the
very
moment
they
were
combining
to
crush
him
an
operation
which
stamps
him
as
a
military
genius
of
the
highest
order
lord
wolseley

a
week
later
he
had
vanished
and
when
he
appeared
on
the
chickahominy
banks
fremont
and
mcdowell
were
still
guarding
the
roads
to
washington
and
mcclellan
was
waiting
for

men
absolutely
paralysed
by
only

of
affords
a
parallel
to
this
extraordinary
spectacle
these
brilliant
successes
appear
to
me
models
of
their
kind
both
in
conception
and
execution
they
should
be
closely
studied
by
all
officers
who
wish
to
learn
the
art
and
science
of
ibid
jackson
task
was
undoubtedly
facilitated
by
the
ignorance
of
lincoln
and
the
incapacity
of
his
political
generals
but
in
estimating
his
achievements
this
ignorance
and
incapacity
are
only
of
secondary
importance
the
historians
do
not
dwell
upon
the
mistakes
of
colli
beaulieu
and
wurmser
in
but
on
the
brilliant
resolution
with
which
napoleon
took
advantage
of
them
and
the
salient
features
both
of
the
valley
campaign
and
of
that
of
are
the
untiring
vigilance
with
which
opportunities
were
looked
for
the
skill
with
which
they
were
detected
and
the
daring
rapidity
with
which
they
were
seized
history
often
unconsciously
injures
the
reputation
of
great
soldiers
the
more
detailed
the
narrative
the
less
brilliant
seems
success
the
less
excusable
defeat
when
we
are
made
fully
acquainted
with
the
dispositions
of
both
sides
the
correct
solution
of
the
problem
strategical
or
tactical
is
generally
so
plain
that
we
may
easily
be
led
to
believe
that
it
must
needs
have
spontaneously
suggested
itself
to
the
victorious
leader
and
as
a
natural
corollary
that
success
is
due
rather
to
force
of
will
than
to
force
of
intellect
to
vigilance
energy
and
audacity
rather
than
to
insight
and
calculation
it
is
asserted
for
instance
by
superficial
critics
that
both
wellington
and
napoleon
in
the
campaign
of
committed
unpardonable
errors
undoubtedly
at
first
sight
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
one
should
have
disregarded
the
probability
of
the
french
invading
belgium
by
the
charleroi
road
or
that
the
other
on
the
morning
of
the
great
battle
should
never
have
suspected
that
blucher
was
close
at
hand
but
the
critic
knowledge
of
the
situation
is
far
more
ample
and
accurate
than
that
of
either
commander
had
either
wellington
before
quatre
bras
or
napoleon
on
the
fateful
june
known
what
we
know
now
matters
would
have
turned
out
very
differently
if
said
frederick
the
great
we
had
exact
information
of
our
enemy
dispositions
we
should
beat
him
every
time
but
exact
information
is
never
forthcoming
a
general
in
the
field
literally
walks
in
darkness
and
his
success
will
be
in
proportion
to
the
facility
with
which
his
mental
vision
can
pierce
the
veil
his
manoeuvres
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
must
always
be
based
on
probabilities
for
his
most
recent
reports
almost
invariably
relate
to
events
which
at
best
are
several
hours
old
and
meanwhile
what
has
the
enemy
been
doing
this
it
is
the
most
essential
part
of
his
business
to
discover
and
it
is
a
matter
of
hard
thinking
and
sound
judgment
from
the
indications
furnished
by
his
reports
and
from
the
consideration
of
many
circumstances
with
some
of
which
he
is
only
imperfectly
acquainted
he
must
divine
the
intentions
of
his
opponent
it
is
not
pretended
that
even
the
widest
experience
and
the
finest
intellect
confer
infallibility
but
clearness
of
perception
and
the
power
of
deduction
together
with
the
strength
of
purpose
which
they
create
are
the
fount
and
origin
of
great
achievements
and
when
we
find
a
campaign
in
which
they
played
a
predominant
part
we
may
fairly
rate
it
as
a
masterpiece
of
war
it
can
hardly
be
disputed
that
these
qualities
played
such
a
part
on
the
shenandoah
for
instance
when
jackson
left
the
valley
to
march
against
milroy
many
things
might
have
happened
which
would
have
brought
about
disaster
banks
who
was
reported
to
have
men
at
harrisonburg
might
have
moved
on
staunton
joined
hands
with
milroy
and
crushed
edward
johnson
banks
might
have
attacked
ewell
with
superior
numbers
fremont
if
he
got
warning
of
jackson
purpose
might
have
reinforced
milroy
occupied
a
strong
position
and
requested
banks
to
threaten
or
attack
the
confederates
in
rear
fremont
might
have
withdrawn
his
advanced
brigade
and
have
reinforced
banks
from
moorefield
banks
might
have
been
reinforced
by
blenker
of
whose
whereabouts
jackson
was
uncertain
banks
might
have
marched
to
join
mcdowell
at
fredericksburg
mcclellan
might
have
pressed
johnston
so
closely
that
a
decisive
battle
could
not
have
been
long
delayed
mcdowell
might
have
marched
on
richmond
intervening
between
the
valley
army
and
the
capital
such
an
array
of
possibilities
would
have
justified
a
passive
attitude
on
elk
run
a
calculation
of
the
chances
however
showed
jackson
that
the
dangers
of
action
were
illusory
never
take
counsel
of
your
fears
was
a
maxim
often
on
his
lips
unlike
many
others
he
first
made
up
his
mind
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
then
and
not
till
then
did
he
consider
what
his
opponents
might
do
to
thwart
him
to
seize
the
initiative
was
his
chief
preoccupation
and
in
this
case
it
did
not
seem
difficult
to
do
so
he
knew
that
banks
was
unenterprising
it
was
improbable
that
mcdowell
would
advance
until
mcclellan
was
near
richmond
and
mcclellan
was
very
slow
to
prevent
fremont
getting
an
inkling
of
his
design
in
time
to
cross
it
was
not
impossible
and
lincoln
anxiety
for
washington
might
be
relied
on
to
keep
banks
in
the
valley
it
is
true
that
jackson
force
was
very
small
but
the
manifestation
of
military
genius
is
not
affected
by
numbers
the
handling
of
masses
is
a
mechanical
art
of
which
knowledge
and
experience
are
the
key
but
it
is
the
manner
in
which
the
grand
principles
of
war
are
applied
which
marks
the
great
leader
and
these
principles
may
be
applied
as
resolutely
and
effectively
with
men
as
with
in
meditation
says
bacon
all
dangers
should
be
seen
in
execution
none
unless
they
are
very
formidable
it
was
on
this
precept
that
jackson
acted
not
a
single
one
of
his
manoeuvres
but
was
based
on
a
close
and
judicial
survey
of
the
situation
every
risk
was
weighed
nothing
was
left
to
chance
there
was
never
a
commander
says
his
chief
of
the
staff
whose
foresight
was
more
complete
nothing
emerged
which
had
not
been
considered
before
in
his
mind
no
possibility
was
overlooked
he
was
never
surprised
dabney
volume
page
the
character
of
his
opponent
the
morale
of
the
hostile
troops
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
manner
in
which
physical
features
could
be
turned
to
account
were
all
matters
of
the
most
careful
consideration
he
was
a
constant
student
of
the
map
and
his
topographical
engineer
was
one
of
the
most
important
officers
on
his
staff
it
could
readily
be
seen
writes
major
hotchkiss
that
in
the
preparations
he
made
for
securing
success
he
had
fully
in
mind
what
napoleon
had
done
under
similar
circumstances
resembling
napoleon
especially
in
this
that
he
was
very
particular
in
securing
maps
and
in
acquiring
topographical
information
he
furnished
me
with
every
facility
that
i
desired
for
securing
topographical
information
and
for
making
maps
allowing
me
a
complete
transportation
outfit
for
my
exclusive
use
and
sending
men
into
the
enemy
country
to
procure
copies
of
local
maps
when
i
expressed
a
desire
to
have
them
i
do
not
think
he
had
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
valley
previous
to
the
war
when
i
first
reported
to
him
for
duty
at
the
beginning
of
march
he
told
me
that
he
wanted
a
complete
map
of
the
entire
shenandoah
valley
from
harper
ferry
to
lexington
one
showing
every
point
of
offence
and
defence
and
to
that
task
i
immediately
addressed
myself
as
a
rule
he
did
not
refer
to
maps
in
the
field
making
his
study
of
them
in
advance
he
undoubtedly
had
the
power
of
retaining
the
topography
of
the
country
in
his
imagination
he
had
spent
his
youth
among
the
mountains
where
there
were
but
few
waggon
roads
but
many
bridle
and
foot
paths
his
early
occupation
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
become
familiar
with
such
intricate
ways
and
i
think
this
had
a
very
important
bearing
on
his
ability
to
promptly
recognise
the
topographical
features
of
the
country
and
to
recall
them
whenever
it
became
necessary
to
make
use
of
them
he
was
quick
in
comprehending
topographical
features
i
made
it
a
point
nevertheless
to
be
always
ready
to
give
him
a
graphic
representation
of
any
particular
point
of
the
region
where
operations
were
going
on
making
a
rapid
sketch
of
the
topography
in
his
presence
and
using
different
coloured
pencils
for
greater
clearness
in
the
definition
of
surface
features
the
carefully
prepared
map
generally
had
too
many
points
of
detail
and
did
not
sufficiently
emphasise
features
apparently
insignificant
but
from
a
military
standpoint
most
important
i
may
add
that
jackson
not
only
studied
the
general
maps
of
the
country
but
made
a
particular
study
of
those
of
any
district
where
he
expected
to
march
or
fight
constantly
using
sketch
maps
made
upon
the
ground
to
inform
him
as

sketches
for
him

on

march

during
engagements
in
answer
to

requests
for
information
letter
to
the
author
it
is
little
wonder
that
it
should
have
been
said
by
his
soldiers
that
he
knew
every
hole
and
corner
of
the
valley
as
if
he
had
made
it
himself
but
to
give
attention
to
topography
was
not
all
that
jackson
had
learned
from
napoleon
as
a
strategist
says
dabney
the
first
napoleon
was
undoubtedly
his
model
he
had
studied
his
campaigns
diligently
and
he
was
accustomed
to
remark
with
enthusiasm
upon
the
evidences
of
his
genius
napoleon
he
said
was
the
first
to
show
what
an
army
could
be
made
to
accomplish
he
had
shown
what
was
the
value
of
time
as
an
element
of
strategic
combination
and
that
good
troops
if
well
cared
for
could
be
made
to
march
miles
daily
and
win
battles
besides
and
he
had
learned
more
than
this
we
must
make
this
campaign
he
said
at
the
beginning
of
an
exceedingly
active
one
only
thus
can
a
weaker
country
cope
with
a
stronger
it
must
make
up
in
activity
what
it
lacks
in
strength
a
defensive
campaign
can
only
be
made
successful
by
taking
the
aggressive
at
the
proper
time
napoleon
never
waited
for
his
adversary
to
become
fully
prepared
but
struck
him
the
first
blow
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
in
the
writings
of
napoleon
to
find
a
passage
which
embodies
his
conception
of
war
in
terms
as
definite
as
these
but
no
words
could
convey
it
more
clearly
it
is
sometimes
forgotten
that
napoleon
was
often
outnumbered
at
the
outset
of
a
campaign
it
was
not
only
in
the
campaigns
of
italy
of
leipsic
of
and
of
waterloo
that
the
hostile
armies
were
larger
than
his
own
in
those
of
ulm
austerlitz
eckmuhl
and
dresden
he
was
numerically
inferior
on
the
whole
theatre
of
war
but
while
the
french
troops
were
concentrated
under
a
single
chief
the
armies
of
the
allies
were
scattered
over
a
wide
area
and
unable
to
support
each
other
before
they
could
come
together
napoleon
moving
with
the
utmost
rapidity
struck
the
first
blow
and
they
were
defeated
in
succession
the
first
principle
of
war
is
to
concentrate
superior
force
at
the
decisive
point
that
is
upon
the
field
of
battle
but
it
is
exceedingly
seldom
that
by
standing
still
and
leaving
the
initiative
to
the
enemy
that
this
principle
can
be
observed
for
a
numerically
inferior
force
if
it
once
permits
its
enemy
to
concentrate
can
hardly
hope
for
success
true
generalship
is
therefore
to
make
up
in
activity
for
lack
of
strength
to
strike
the
enemy
in
detail
and
overthrow
his
columns
in
succession
and
the
highest
art
of
all
is
to
compel
him
to
disperse
his
army
and
then
to
concentrate
superior
force
against
each
fraction
in
turn
it
is
such
strategy
as
this
that
gains
the
ends
of
states
and
makes
men
heroes

when

out

at

it

inaptly
with

it
may
even
be
questioned
whether
in
some
respects
it
was
not
more
brilliant
the
odds
against
the
confederates
were
far
greater
than
against
the
french
jackson
had
to
deal
with
a
homogeneous
enemy
with
generals
anxious
to
render
each
other
loyal
support
and
not
with
the
contingents
of
different
states
his
marches
were
far
longer
than
napoleon
the
theatre
of
war
was
not
less
difficult
his
troops
were
not
veterans
but
in
great
part
the
very
rawest
of
recruits
the
enemy
officers

soldiers
were
not
inferior
to
his
own
their
leaders
were
at

equal
in
capacity
to
colli
beaulieu

alvinzi
and
the
statesmen
who
directed
them
were
not
more
purblind
than
the
aulic
council
moreover
jackson
was
merely
the
commander
of
a
detached
force
which
might
at
any
moment
be
required
at
richmond
the
risks
which
napoleon
freely
accepted
he
could
not
afford
he
dared
not
deliver
battle
unless
he
were
certain
of
success
and
his
one
preoccupation
was
to
lose
as
few
men
as
possible
but
be
this
as
it
may

secrecy

in
my
personal
intercourse
with
jackson
writes
general
imboden
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
he
often
said
that
there
were
two
things
never
to
be
lost
sight
of
by
a
military
commander
always
mystify
mislead
and
surprise
the
enemy
if
possible
and
when
you
strike
and
overcome
him
never
give
up
the
pursuit
as
long
as
your
men
have
strength
to
follow
for
an
army
routed
if
hotly
pursued
becomes
and
can
then
be
destroyed
by
half
their
number
the
other
rule
is
never
fight
against
heavy
odds
if
by
any
possible
manoeuvering
you
can
hurl
your
own
force
on
only
a
part
and
that
the
weakest
part
of
your
enemy
and
crush
it
such
tactics
will
win
every

a
small
army
may
thus
destroy

large

and
again
to

maxims
were
the
outcome

studies

absolutely
and
merely
says

from
his
knowledge
of
war
as
learned
from
the
great
leaders
of
former
days
north

and
if
he
made
war
by
rule
as
he
had
regulated
his
conduct
as
a
cadet
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
his
rules
were
of
the
soundest
they
are
a
complete
summary
of
the
tactics

wrought
such
havoc
in
the

the
order
in
which
they
are

is
interesting
to
mystify
mislead

surprise
is
the
first
precept
how
thoroughly
it
was
applied
the
measures
by
which
his
adversaries
were
to
be
deceived
were
as
carefully
thought
out

no
precaution

trivial

made
up

full
of
spies

southern
newspapers

sometimes
indiscreet

the
simple
fact
that
jackson
had
been
seen
near
richmond
would
have
warned
mcclellan
that
his
right
wing
was
in
jeopardy
few
men

have
taken
such
infinite
trouble
to
hide
the
departure
from

to
attack

soldiers
of
experience
alive
to
the
full
bearing
of

petty
details
appreciate
his
skill

manner
says

in
which
he
thus
mystified
his
enemy

this
most
important
movement

a
masterpiece
north

and
according
to
the
dictum
of
napoleon
there
are
no
such
things
as
trifles
in

it
was
not
however
on
such
expedients
that
jackson
principally
relied
to
keep
his
enemy
in
the
dark
the
use
he
made
of
his
cavalry
is
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
tactical
feature
of
the
campaign
ashby

the
means
whereby
the
federals
were
mystified
not
only
was
a
screen
established
which
perfectly
concealed
the
movements

the
valley
army
but
constant
demonstrations
at
far
distant
points
alarmed
and
bewildered
the
federal
commanders
in
his
employment
of
cavalry
jackson
was
in
advance
of
his
age
his
patrols
were
kept
out
two

three
marches
to
front
and
flank
neither
by

nor
by

were
they
permitted
to
lose
touch

thus
no
movement
could
take
place

knowledge
such
tactics
had
not
been
seen
since

which
riding
sometimes
a
hundred
miles

vanished
from

vast
importance
ascribed
by
the
emperor
to
procuring
early
information
of
his
enemy
and
hiding
his
own
movements
had
been
overlooked

it
was
left
to
an
american

revive
his
methods
the
application
of

misled
by

unable
to
procure

never
knew
at
what
point
they
should
concentrate
and
support
invariably
came
too
late
jackson
tactical
successes
were
achieved
over
comparatively
small
forces
except
at
cross
keys
and
there
he
only
intended
to
check
fremont
for
the
moment
he
never
encountered
more
than
men
on
any
single
field
no
great
victory
like
austerlitz

salamanca
was
won
over
equal
numbers
no
chancellorsville
where
a
huge
army
was
overthrown
by
one
scarce
half
the
size
is
reckoned
amongst
the
triumphs
of
the
valley
campaign
but
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
jackson
was
always
outnumbered
and
outnumbered
heavily
on
the
theatre
of
war
and
if
he
defeated
his
enemies
in
detail
their
overthrow
was
not
less
decisive
than
if
it
had
been
brought
about
at
one
time
and
at
one
place
the
fact
that
they
were
unable
to
combine
their
superior
numbers
before
the
blow
fell
is
in
itself
the
strongest
testimony
to
his
ability
how
often
says
napier
have
we
not
heard
the
genius
of
buonaparte
slighted
and
his
victories
talked
of
as
destitute
of
merit
because
at
the
point
of
attack
he
was
superior
in
numbers
to
his
enemies
this
very
fact
which
has
been
so
often
converted
into
a
sort
of
reproach
constitutes
his
greatest
and
truest
praise
he
so
directed
his
attack
as
at
once
to
divide
his
enemy
and
to
fall
with
the
mass
of
his
own
forces
upon
a
point
where
their
division
or
the
distribution
of
their
army
left
them
unable
to
resist
him
it
is
not
in
man
to
defeat
armies
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
nor
was
buonaparte
commissioned
like
gideon
to
confound
and
destroy
a
host
with
three
hundred
men
he
knew
that
everything
depended
ultimately
upon
physical
superiority
and
his
genius
was
shown
in
this
that
though
outnumbered
on
the
whole
he
was
always
superior
to
his
enemies

the
decisive
point

out

novel

the
bonds
of
discipline
were
slight
when
the
march
to
was
begun
which
was
to
end
five
weeks
later
at
port
republic
a
considerable
number
of
the
effectives
had
only
been
drilled
for
a
few
hours
the
cavalry
on
parade
was
little
better
than
a
mob
on
the
line
of
march
they
kept
or
left
the
ranks
as
the
humour
took
them
it
is
true
that
the
federals
were
hardly
more
efficient
but
operations
were
essentially
offensive
and
offensive
operations
as
was
shown
at
bull
run
are
to
raw
troops
attack
can
not
be
carried
to
a
triumphant
issue
unless
every
fraction
of
the
force
with
those
on
either
hand
and
is
hardly
to
be
expected
from
inexperienced
officers
moreover
offensive
operations
especially
when
a
small
force
is
manoeuvring
against
the
fraction
of
a
larger
depend
for
success
on
order
rapidity
and
endurance
and
it
is
in
these
qualities
as
a
rule
that
raw
troops
are
particularly
deficient
yet
jackson
like
napoleon
at
ulm
might
have
boasted
with
truth
that
he
had
destroyed
the
enemy
merely
by
marches
and
his
men
accomplished
feats
of
which
the
hardiest
veterans
might
well
be
proud
from
april
to
june
that
is
in
days
they
marched
four
hundred
miles
fought
three
battles
and
numerous
combats
and
were
victorious
in
all
several
of
the
marches
exceeded
miles
a
day
and
in
retreat
from
the
potomac
to
port
republic
the
army
made
one
hundred
and
four
miles
between
the
morning
of
may
and
the
night
of
june
that
is
fifteen
miles
daily
without
a
rest
day
intervening
this
record
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
infamous
roads
is
remarkable
and
it
well
may
be
asked
by
what
means
these
troops
were
enabled
to
accomplish
such
a
feat
campaigning
in
france
says
general
sheridan
who
was
with
the
prussian
headquarter
staff
in
that
is
the
marching
camping
and
subsisting
of
an
army
is
an
easy
matter
very
unlike
anything
we
had
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
to
repeat
the
country
is
rich
beautiful
and
densely
populated
subsistence
abundant
and
the
roads
all
macadamised
highways
thus
the
conditions
are
altogether
different
from
those
existing
with
us
i
can
but
leave
to
conjecture
how
the
germans
would
have
got
along
on
bottomless
roads
often
none
at
all
through
the
swamps
and
quicksands
of
northern
memoirs
volume
page
jackson
rules
for
marching
have
been
preserved
he
never
broke
down
his
men
by
movement
he
rested
the
whole
column
very
often
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
he
liked
to
see
the
men
lie
flat
on
the
ground
to
rest
and
would
say
a
man
rests
all
over
when
he
lies
down
battles
and
leaders
volume
pages
nor
did
he
often
call
upon
his
troops
for
extraordinary
exertions
in
the
period
between
his
departure
from
elk
run
mountain
to
the
battle
of
port
republic
there
were
only
four
series
of
forced
marches
from
april
to
april
when
he
moved
to
elk
run
valley
may
to
may
when
he
moved
against
milroy
may
to
may
when
he
moved
against
banks
and
may
to
june
when
he
passed
south
between
fremont
and
shields
the
hardships
of
forced
marches
he
said
are
often
more
painful
than
the
dangers
of
battle
it
was
only
in
short
when
he
intended
a
surprise
or
when
a
rapid
retreat
was
imperative
that
he
sacrificed
everything
to
speed
the
troops
marched
light
carrying
only
rifles
blankets
haversacks
and
ammunition
when
long
distances
were
to
be
covered
those
men
who
still
retained
their
knapsacks
were
ordered
to
leave
them
behind
no
heavy
trains
accompanied
the
army
the
ambulances
and
ammunition
waggons
were
always
present
but
the
supply
waggons
were
often
far
in
rear
in
their
haversacks
the
men
carried
several
rations
and
when
these
were
consumed
they
lived
either
on
the
farmers
or
on
the
stores
they
had
captured
from
the
enemy
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
that
the
ranks
remained
full
i
had
rather
said
jackson
lose
one
man
in
marching
than
five
in
fighting
and
to
this
rule
he
rigorously
adhered
he
never
gave
the
enemy
warning
by
a
deliberate
approach
along
the
main
roads
and
if
there
was
a
chance
of
effecting
a
surprise
or
if
the
enemy
was
already
flying
it
mattered
little
how
many
men
fell
out
and
fall
out
they
did
in
large
numbers
between
may
and
the
battle
of
cross
keys
the
army
was
reduced
from
men
to
not
more
than
had
been
killed
or
wounded
so
there
were
no
less
than
absentees
many
were
footsore
and
found
no
place
in
the
ambulances
many
were
sick
others
on
detachment
but
a
large
proportion
had
absented
themselves
without
asking
leave
two
days
after
winchester
in
a
letter
to
ewell
jackson
writes
that
the
evil
of
straggling
has
become
enormous
such
severe
exertion
as
the
march
against
kenly
the
pursuit
of
banks
and
the
retreat
from
the
potomac
would
have
told
their
tale
upon
the
hardiest
veterans
when
the
german
armies
suddenly
changing
direction
from
west
to
north
pushed
on
to
sedan
by
forced
marches
large
numbers
of
the
infantry
succumbed
to
pure
exhaustion
when
the
light
division
in
pressing
forward
after
sauroren
to
intercept
the
french
retreat
marched
nineteen
consecutive
hours
in
very
sultry
weather
and
over
forty
miles
of
mountain
roads
many
men
fell
and
died
convulsed
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
while
others
whose
spirit
and
strength
had
never
before
been
quelled
leant
on
their
muskets
and
muttered
in
sullen
tones
that
they
yielded
for
the
first
time
the
war
in
the
peninsula
napier
volume
page
but
the
men
that
fell
out
on
the
march
to
sedan
and
in
the
passes
of
the
pyrenees
were
physically
incapable
of
further
effort
they
were
not
stragglers
in
the
true
sense
of
the
term
and
in
an
army
broken
to
discipline
straggling
on
the
line
of
march
is
practically
unknown
the
sickly
and
feeble
may
fall
away
but
every
sound
man
may
confidently
be
relied
upon
to
keep
his
place
the
secret
of
full
ranks
is
good
officers
and
strict
discipline
and
the
most
marked
difference
between
regular
troops
and
those
hastily
organised
is
this
with
the
former
the
waste
of
men
will
be
small
with
the
latter
very
great
in
all
armies
however
constituted
there
is
a
large
proportion
of
men
whose
hearts
are
not
in
the
business
general
sheridan
is
said
to
have
declared
that
per
cent
of
the
federal
soldiers
lacked
the
military
spirit
when
hard
marching
and
heavy
fighting
are
in
prospect
the
inclination
of
such
men
is
to
make
themselves
scarce
and
when
discipline
is
relaxed
they
will
soon
find
the
opportunity
but
when
their
instincts
of
obedience
are
strong
when
the
only
home
they
know
is
with
the
colours
when
the
credit
of
their
regiment
is
at
stake
and
even
the
most
worthless
have
some
feeling
for
their
own
corps
engrained
habit
and
familiar
associations
overcome
their
natural
weakness
the
bereft
of
his
rider
at
once
seeks
his
comrades
and
pushes
his
way
with
empty
saddle
into
his
place
in
the
ranks
and
so
the
soldier
by
profession
as
he
may
be
marches
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
his
comrades
and
acquires
a
fictitious
but
not
unuseful
courage
from
his
contact
with
braver
men
it
is
true
that
the
want
of
good
boots
told
heavily
on
the
confederates
a
pair
already
such
as
many
of
the
men
started
with
was
hardly
calculated
to
last
out
a
march
of
several
hundred
miles
over
rocky
tracks
and
fresh
supplies
were
seldom
forthcoming
there
was
a
dearth
both
of
and
in
the
south
and
if
davis
before
the
blockade
was
established
had
indented
on
the
shoemakers
of
europe
he
would
have
added
very
largely
to
the
efficiency
of
his
armies
a
few
cargoes
of
good
boots
would
have
been
more
useful
than
a
shipload
of
rifled
guns
nevertheless
the
absentees
from
the
ranks
were
not
all
footsore
the
vice
of
straggling
was
by
no
means
confined
to
jackson
command
it
was
the
curse
of
both
armies
federal
and
confederate
the
official
records
as
well
as
the
memoirs
of
participants
teem
with
references
to
it
it
was
an
evil
which
the
severest
punishments
seemed
incapable
of
checking
it
was
in
vain
that
it
was
denounced
in
orders
that
the
men

jackson
then
had
to
contend
with
difficulties
which
a
general
in
command
of
regular
troops
would
not
have
been
called
on
to
provide
against
and
in
other
respects
also
he
suffered
from
the
constitution
of
his
army
the
one
thing
lacking
in
the
valley
campaign
was
a
decisive
victory
over
a
considerable
detachment
of
the
federal
army
the
annihilation
of
one
of
the
converging
forces
and
large
capture
of
guns
and
prisoners
a
victory
as
complete
as
rivoli
would
have
completed
its
dramatic
interest
but
for
this
jackson
himself
was
hardly
to
blame
the
misconduct
of
the
confederate
cavalry
on
may
and
permitted
banks
to
escape
destruction
and
the
delay
at
the
temporary
bridge
near
port
republic
due
mainly
to
the
disinclination
of
the
troops
to
face
the
ford
and
the
want
of
resolute
obedience
on
the
part
of
their
commanders
saved
fremont
from
the
same
fate
had
shields
advanced
brigades
been
driven
back
as
jackson
designed
while
the
day
was
still
young
the
operations
of
the
valley
army
would
in
all
probability
have
been
crowned
by
a
brilliant
triumph
over
nearly
equal
forces
fremont
already
fearful
and
irresolute
was
hardly
the
man
to
withstand
the
vigour
of
jackson
onset
and
that
onset
would
assuredly
have
been
made
if
more
careful
arrangements
had
been
made
to
secure
the
bridge
this
was
not
the
only
mistake
committed
by
the
staff
the
needlessly
long
march
of
the
main
body
when
approaching
front
royal
on
may
might
well
have
been
obviated
but
for
this
delay
the
troops
might
have
pushed
on
before
nightfall
to
within
easy
reach
of
the
valley
turnpike
and
banks
have
been
cut
off
from
winchester
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
even
with
regular
troops
the
same
mistakes
might
have
occurred
they
are
by
no
means
without
parallel
and
even
those
committed
by
the
federals
have
their
exact
counterpart
in
european
warfare
at
the
beginning
of
august
the
french
army
like
banks
division
on
may
was
in
two
portions
divided
by
a
range
of
mountains
the
staff
was
aware
that
the
germans
were
in
superior
strength
but
their
dispositions
were
unknown
like
banks
they
neglected
to
reconnoitre
and
when
a
weak
detachment
beyond
the
mountains
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
they
still
refused
to
believe
that
attack
was
imminent
the
crushing
defeats
of
worth
and
spicheren
were
the
result
the
staff
of
a
regular
army
is
not
always
infallible
it
would
be
hard
to
match
the
extraordinary
series
of
blunders
made
by
the
staffs
of
the
three
armies
english
french
and
prussian
in
the
campaign
of
waterloo
and
yet
there
was
probably
no
senior
officer
present
in
belgium
who
had
not
seen
several
campaigns
but
the
art
of
war
has
made
vast
strides
since
waterloo
and
even
since
under
system
which
has
been
applied
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
to
nearly
all
professional
armies
the
chance
of
mistakes
has
been
much
reduced
the
staff
is
no
longer
casually
educated
and
selected
haphazard
the
peace
training
of
both
officers
and
men
is
far
more
thorough
and
those
essential
details
on
which
the
most
brilliant
conceptions
tactical
and
strategical
depend
for
success
stand
much
less
chance
of
being
overlooked
than
in
it
is
by
the
standard
of
a
modern
army
and
not
of
those
whose
only
school
in
peace
was
the
that
the
american
armies
must
be
judged
that
jackson
tactical
skill
and
his
quick
eye
for
ground
had
much
to
do
with
his
victories
can
hardly
be
questioned
at
kernstown
and
port
republic
he
seized
the
key
of
the
position
without
a
hesitation
at
winchester
when
ewell
was
checked
upon
the
right
three
strong
brigades
suddenly
thrown
forward
on
the
opposite
flank
completely
rolled
up
the
federal
line
at
cross
keys
the
position
selected
for
ewell
proved
too
formidable
for
fremont
despite
his
superiority
in
guns
at
port
republic
taylor
unexpected
approach
through
the
tangled
forest
was
at
once
decisive
of
the
engagement
the
cavalry
charge
at
front
royal
was
admirably
timed
and
the
manner
in
which
ashby
was
employed
throughout
the
campaign
not
only
to
screen
the
advance
but
to
check
pursuit
was
a
proof
of
the
highest
tactical
ability
nor
should
the
quick
insight
into
the
direction
of
shields
march
on
june
and
the
destruction
of
the
bridges
by
which
he
could
communicate
with
fremont
be
omitted
it
is
true
that
the
operations
in
the
valley
were
not
absolutely
faultless
when
jackson
was
bent
on
an
effective
blow
his
impatience
to
bring
the
enemy
to
bay
robbed
him
more
than
once
of
complete
success
on
the
march
to
johnson
brigade
the
advanced
guard
had
been
permitted
to
precede
the
main
body
by
seven
miles
and
consequently
when
milroy
attacked
there
was
not
sufficient
force
at
hand
for
a
decisive
counterstroke
moreover
with
an
staff
a
careful
supervision
was
most
essential
and
the
waggon
bridge
at
port
republic
should
have
been
inspected
by
a
trustworthy
staff
officer
before
winder
rushed
across
to
fall
on
tyler
errors
of
this
nature
however
instructive
they
may
be
to
the
student
of
war
are
but
spots
upon
the
sun
and
in
finding
in
his
subordinate
such
breadth
of
view
and
such
vigour
of
execution
lee
was
fortunate
indeed
jackson
was
no
less
fortunate
when
ashby
came
under
his
command
that
dashing
captain
of
was
undoubtedly
a
most
valuable
colleague
it
was
something
to
have
a
cavalry
leader
who
could
not
only
fight
and
reconnoitre
but
who
had
sagacity
enough
to
divine
the
enemy
intentions
but
the
ideas
that
governed
the
employment
of
the
cavalry
were
jackson
alone
he
it
was
who
placed
the
squadrons
across
fremont
road
from
wardensville
who
ordered
the
demonstrations
against
banks
before
both
and
front
royal
and
those
which
caused
fremont
to
retreat
after
port
republic
more
admirable
still
was
the
quickness
with
which
he
recognised
the
use
that
might
be
made
of
mounted
riflemen
from
the
potomac
to
port
republic
his
horsemen
covered
his
retreat
dismounting
behind
every
stream
and
along
the
borders
of
every
wood
checking
the
pursuers
with
their
fire
compelling
them
to
deploy
their
infantry
and
then
retreating
rapidly
to
the
next
position
day
after
day
were
the
federal
advanced
guards
held
in
check
their
columns
delayed
and
the
generals
irritated
by
their
slippery
foe
meanwhile
the
confederate
infantry
falling
back
at
their
leisure
were
relieved
of
all
annoyance
and
if
the
cavalry
was
suddenly
driven
in
support
was
invariably
at
hand
and
a
compact
brigade
of
infantry
supported
by
artillery
sent
the
pursuing
horsemen
to
the
the
retreat
of
the
valley
army
was
managed
with
the
same
skill
as
its
advance
and
the
tactics
of
the
campaign
are
no
less
remarkable
than
those
of
the
attack
to
judge
from
the
valley
campaign
jackson
handled
his
horsemen
with
more
skill
than
any
other
commander
confederate
or
federal
a
cavalry
that
could
defend
itself
on
foot
as
well
as
charge
in
the
saddle
was
practically
a
new
arm
of
far
greater
efficiency
than
cavalry
of
the
old
type
and
jackson
at
once
recognised
not
only
its
value
but
the
manner
in
which
it
could
be
most
effectively
employed
he
was
not
led
away
by
the
specious
advantages
so
eagerly
urged
by
young
and
ambitious
soldiers
of
the
raids
even
lee
himself
as
he
was
appears
to
have
been
fascinated
by
the
idea
of
throwing
a
great
body
of
horsemen
across
his
communications
spreading
terror
amongst
his
supply
trains
cutting
his
telegraphs
and
destroying
his
magazines
in
hardly
a
single
instance
did
such
expeditions
inflict
more
than
temporary
discomfort
on
the
enemy
and
the
armies
were
led
more
than
once
into
false
manoeuvres
for
want
of
the
information
which
only
the
cavalry
could
supply
lee
at
malvern
hill
and
gettysburg
hooker
at
chancellorsville
grant
at
spotsylvania
owed
defeat
in
great
measure
to
the
absence
of
their
mounted
troops
in
the
valley
on
the
contrary
success
was
made
possible
because
the
cavalry
was
kept
to
its
legitimate
duty
that
is
to
procure
information
to
screen
all
movements
to
take
part
in
battle
at
the
decisive
moment
and
to
carry
out
the
pursuit
with
all
his
regard
for
napoleon
maxims
jackson
was
no
slave
to
rule
in
war
circumstances
vary
to
such
an
extent
that
a
manoeuvre
which
at
one
time
is
manifestly
unsound
may
at
another
be
the
most
judicious
the
rules
are
never
binding
they
merely
point
out
the
risks
which
are
generally
entailed
by
some
particular
course
of
action
there
is
no
principle
on
which
napoleon
lays
more
stress
than
that
a
general
should
never
divide
his
force
either
on
the
field
of
battle
or
the
theatre
of
war
but
when
he
marched
to
and
left
ewell
at
swift
run
gap
jackson
deliberately
divided
his
forces
and
left
banks
between
them
knowing
that
the
apparent
risk
with
an
opponent
like
banks
was
no
risk
at
all
at
the
battle
of
winchester
too
there
was
a
gap
of
a
mile
between
the
brigades
on
the
left
of
the
kernstown
road
and
ewell
on
the
right
and
owing
to
the
intervening
hills
one
wing
was
invisible
to
the
other
here
again
like
moltke
at
koniggratz
jackson
realised
that
the
principle
might
be
disregarded
not
only
with
impunity
but
with
effect
he
was
not
like
lord
galway
a
man
who
was
in
war
what
moliere
doctors
were
in
medicine
who
thought
it
much
more
honourable
to
fail
according
to
rule
than
to
succeed
by
innovation
macaulay
but
the
triumphs
of
the
valley
campaign
were
not
due
alone
to
the
orders
issued
by
lee
and
jackson
the
confederate
troops
displayed
extraordinary
endurance
when
the
stragglers
were
eliminated
their
stauncher
comrades
proved
themselves
true
as
steel
in
every
engagement
the
regiments
fought
with
stubborn
courage
they
sometimes
failed
to
break
the
enemy
line
at
the
first
rush
but
except
at
kernstown
the
federals
never
drove
them
from
their
position
and
taylor
advance
at
winchester
trimble
counterstroke
at
cross
keys
the
storming
of
the
battery
at
port
republic
and
the
charge
of
the
cavalry
at
cedarville
were
the
deeds
of
brave
and
resolute
men
a
retreat
is
the
most
exhausting
of
military
movements
it
is
costly
in
men
more
so
says
napoleon
than
two
battles
and
it
shakes
the
faith
of
the
soldiers
in
their
general
and
in
themselves
jackson
army
retreated
for
seven
days
before
fremont
dwindling
in
numbers
at
every
step
and
yet
it
never
fought
better
than
when
it
turned
at
bay
from
first
to
last
it
believed
itself
superior
to
its
enemies
from
first
to
last
it
was
equal
to
the
tasks
which
its
exacting
commander
imposed
upon
it
and
its
spirit
was
indomitable
throughout
one
male
a
week
and
three
foights
a
day
according
to
one
of
jackson
irishmen
was
the
rule
in
the
campaigns
of
the
forced
marches
were
not
made
in
luxury
not
seldom
only
were
issued
and
more
often
none
at
all
the
weather
for
many
days
in
succession
was
abominable
and
the
forest
bivouacs
were
comfortless
in
the
extreme
on
may
twenty
per
cent
of
brigade
went
into
action
barefoot
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
stores
captured
in
winchester
the
march
to
the
potomac
and
the
subsequent
unmolested
retreat
to
woodstock
would
have
been
hardly
possible
if
the
troops
were
volunteers
weak
in
discipline
and
prone
to
straggling
they
none
the
less
bore
themselves
with
conspicuous
gallantry
their
native
characteristics
came
prominently
to
the
front
patient
under
hardships
vigorous
in
attack
and
stubborn
in
defence
they
showed
themselves
worthy
of
their
commander
their
enthusiastic
patriotism
was
not
without
effect
on
their
bearing
before
the
enemy
every
private
in
the
ranks
believed
that
he
was
fighting
in
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
and
the
spirit
which
nerved
the
resolution
of
the
confederate
soldier
was
the
same
which
inspired
the
resistance
of
their
revolutionary
forefathers
his
hatred
of
the
yankee
as
he
contemptuously
styled
the
northerner
was
even
more
bitter
than
the
wrath
which
washington
soldiers
felt
towards
england
and
it
was
intensified
by
the
fact
that
his
detested
foeman
had
not
only
dared
to
invade
the
south
but
had
proclaimed
his
intention
in
no
uncertain
tones
of
dealing
with
the
sovereign
states
exactly
as
he
pleased
but
it
was
something
more
than
native
courage
and
enthusiastic
patriotism
which
inspired
the
barefooted
heroes
of
winchester
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
that
in
other
parts
of
the
theatre
of
war
the
confederate
troops
were
inferior
to
those
that
held
the
valley
yet
they
were
certainly
less
successful
and
in
very
many
instances
they
had
failed
to
put
forth
the
same
resolute
energy
as
the
men
who
followed
jackson
but
it
is
hardly
possible
to
discuss
the
spirit
of
an
army
apart
from
that
of
its
commander
if
in
strategy
wholly
and
in
tactics
in
great
part
success
emanates
from
a
single
brain
the
morale
of
the
troops
is
not
less
dependent
on
the
influence
of
one
man
better
an
army
of
stags
runs
the
old
proverb
led
by
a
lion
than
an
army
of
lions
led
by
a
stag
their
leader
character
had
already
made
a
sensible
impression
on
the
valley
soldiers
jackson
was
as
untheatrical
as
wellington
he
was
hardly
to
be
distinguished
even
by
his
dress
from
the
private
in
the
ranks
soon
after
his
arrival
at
richmond
he
called
on
pendleton
the
wife
of
the
reverend
captain
of
the
rockbridge
battery
the
negro
servant
left
him
standing
in
the
hall
thinking
that
this
quiet
soldier
clad
in
a
faded
and
sunburnt
uniform
need
not
be
treated
with
further
ceremony
memoirs

headquarters
in
camp
were
an
ordinary
or
a
room
in
the
nearest
cottage
and
they
were
often
without
guard
or
sentry
in
bivouac
the
general
rolled
himself
in
his
blankets
and
lay
down
under
a
tree
or
in
a
fence
corner
he
could
sleep
anywhere
in
the
saddle
under
fire
or
in
church
and
he
could
compel
sleep
to
come
to
him
when
and
where
he
pleased
he
cared
as
little
for
good
quarters
as
a
mountain
hunter
and
he
was
as
abstemious
as
a
red
indian
on
the
he
lived
as
plainly
as
the
men
and
often
shared
their
rations
the
majority
of
the
cavalry
were
better
mounted
and
many
of
his
officers
were
better
dressed
he
was
not
given
to
addressing
his
troops
either
in
mass
or
as
individuals
his
praises
he
reserved
for
his
official
reports
and
then
he
was
generous
in
camp
he
was
as
silent
as
the
sphinx
and
he
never
posed
except
in
action
as
the
commander
of
an
army
off
duty
he
was
the
gentlest
and
most
unpretentious
of
men
and
the
most
approachable
of
generals
he
was
always
scrupulously
polite
and
the
private
soldier
who
asked
him
a
question
might
be
sure
of
a
most
courteous
reply
but
there
was
no
man
with
whom
it
was
less
safe
to
take
liberties
and
where
duty
was
concerned
he
became
a
different
being
the
gentle
tones
grew
curt
and
peremptory
and
the
absent
demeanour
gave
place
to
a
most
purposeful
energy
his
vigilance
was
marvellous
his
eye
was
everywhere
he
let
nothing
pass
without
his
personal
scrutiny
the
unfortunate
officer
accused
of
indolence
or
neglect
found
the
shy
and
quiet
professor
transformed
into
the
most
implacable
of
masters
no
matter
how
high
the
rank
of
the
offender
the
crime
met
with
the
punishment
it
deserved
the
scouts
compared
him
with
lee
the
latter
was
so
genial
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
report
to
him
jackson
them
on
every
detail
treating
them
as
a
lawyer
does
a
hostile
witness
and
his
keen
blue
eyes
seemed
to
search
their
very
souls
nor
did
the
men
escape
when
they
misbehaved
ashby
cavalry
were
reprimanded
in
general
orders
for
their
indiscipline
at
middletown
and
again
at
port
republic
and
if
either
officer
or
regiment
displeased
the
general
it
was
duly
mentioned
in
his
published
reports
it
is
worth
remark
that
jackson
methods
of
punishment
showed
his
deep
knowledge
of
his
soldiers
the
sentence
on
the
men
who
were
tempted
from
their
duty
during
banks
retreat
by
the
plunder
on
the
winchester
road
was
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
serve
with
the
advanced
guard
until
further
orders
it
was
considered
terribly
severe
volume
part
page
but
the
troops
knew
that
their
grave
leader
so
uncommunicative
in
camp
and
so
unrelenting
to
misconduct
was
constantly
occupied
with
their
they
knew
that
he
spared
them
when
opportunity
offered
as
he
never
spared
himself
his
camaraderie
was
expressed
in
something
more
than
words
the
hospitals
constructed
in
the
valley
excited
the
admiration
even
of
the
federals
and
jackson
wounded
were
his
first
care
whatever
it
might
cost
the
army
the
ambulances
must
be
got
safely
away
and
the
sick
and
disabled
soldiers
transferred
to
their
own
people
but
at
the
same
time
the
troops
had
long
since
learned
that
as
administered
by
jackson
the
military
code
was
a
stern
reality
they
had
seen
men
shot
for
striking
their
officers
and
they
knew
that
for
insubordination
or
disobedience
it
was
idle
to
plead
excuse
they
had
thought
their
general
harsh
and
even
cruel
but
as
their
experience
increased
they
recognised
the
wisdom
of
his
severity
and
when
they
looked
upon
that
kindly
face
grave
and
determined
as
it
was
they
realised
how
closely
his
firmness
was
allied
to
tenderness
they
had
learned
how
highly
he
esteemed
them
once
in
his
twelve
months
of
command
he
had
spoken
from
his
heart
when
on
the
heights
near
centreville
he
bade
farewell
to
his
old
brigade
his
pride
in
their
achievements
had
broken
through
the
barriers
of
his
reserve
and
his
ringing
words
had
not
yet
been
forgotten
if
he
was
swift
to
blame
his
general
orders
and
official
dispatches
gave
full
credit
to
every
gallant
action
and
each
man
felt
himself
a
hero
because
his
general
so
regarded
him
they
had
learned
too
that
jackson
commendation
was
worth
having
they
had
seen
him
in
action
the
coolest
of
them
all
riding
along
the
line
of
battle
with
as
much
composure
as
if
the
hail
of
bullets
was
no
more
than
summer
rain
they
had
seen
him
far
in
advance
of
the
charging
lines
cheering
them
to
the
pursuit
and
they
knew
the
tremendous
vigour
of
his
flank
attacks
but
it
was
not
only
confidence
in
the
skill
of
their
commander
that
inspired
the
troops
it
was
impossible
not
to
admire
the
man
who
after
a
sleepless
night
a
long
march
and
hard
fighting
would
say
to
his
officers
we
must
push
on
we
must
push
on
as
unconcernedly
as
if
his
muscles
were
of
steel
and
hunger
an
unknown
sensation
such
fortitude
was
contagious
the
men
caught
something
of
his
resolution
of
his
untiring
energy
and
his
unhesitating
audacity
the
regiments
which
drove
banks
to
the
potomac
were
very
different
from
those
that
crawled
to
romney
through
the
blinding
sleet
or
that
fell
back
with
the
loss
of
their
number
from
the
kernstown
ridge
it
has
been
related
of
jackson
that
when
he
had
once
made
up
his
mind
he
seemed
to
discard
all
idea
of
defeat
and
to
regard
the
issue
as
assured
a
man
less
open
to
the
conviction
that
he
was
beaten
could
not
be
imagined
to
this
frame
of
mind
he
brought
his
soldiers
jackson
brigade
at
bull
run
jackson
division
in
the
valley
jackson
army
corps
later
in
the
war
were
all
imbued
with
the
characteristics
of
their
leader
the
exertions
that
he
demanded
of
them
seemed
beyond
the
powers
of
mortal
men
but
with
jackson
leading
them
the
troops
felt
themselves
able
to
accomplish
impossibilities
i
never
saw
one
of
jackson
couriers
approach
said
ewell
without
expecting
an
order
to
assault
the
north
pole
but
had
the
order
been
given
neither
ewell
nor
the
valley
troops
would
have
questioned
it
with
the
senior
officers
of
his
little
army
jackson
relations
were
in
some
instances
less
cordial
than
with
the
men
his
staff
was
devoted
to
him
for
they
had
learned
to
know
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
valley
campaign
some
of
them
thought
him
mad
before
it
was
over
they
believed
him
to
be
a
genius
he
lived
with
his
military
family
on
the
most
intimate
terms
and
his
unfailing
courtesy
his
utter
absence
of
his
sweet
temper
and
his
tactful
consideration
for
others
no
matter
how
humble
their
rank
were
irresistible
on
duty
indeed
his
staff
officers
fared
badly
tireless
himself
regardless
of
all
personal
comforts
he
seemed
to
think
that
others
were
fashioned
in
the
same
mould
after
a
weary
day
marching
or
fighting
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
him
to
send
them
for
a
ride
of
thirty
or
forty
miles
through
the
night
and
he
gave
the
order
with
no
more
thought
than
if
he
were
sending
them
with
a
message
to
the
next
tent
but
off
duty
he
was
simply
a
personal
friend
bent
on
making
all
things
pleasant
never
says
hunter
mcguire
can
i
forget
his
kindness
and
gentleness
to
me
when
i
was
in
great
sorrow
and
trouble
he
came
to
my
tent
and
spent
hours
with
me
comforting
me
in
his
simple
kindly
christian
way
showing
a
depth
of
friendship
and
affection
which
can
never
be
forgotten
there
is
no
measuring
the
intensity
with
which
the
very
soul
of
jackson
burned
in
battle
out
of
it
he
was
very
gentle
indeed
as
i
look
back
on
the
two
years
that
i
was
daily
indeed
hourly
with
him
his
gentleness
as
a
man
his
tenderness
to
those
in
trouble
or
affliction
the
tenderness
indeed
of
a
woman
impress
me
more
than
his
wonderful
prowess
as
a
warrior
it
was
with
his
generals
and
colonels
that
there
was
sometimes
a
lack
of
sympathy
many
of
these
were
older
than
himself
ewell
and
whiting
were
his
seniors
in
point
of
service
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
was
sometimes
a
little
hard
to
receive
peremptory
orders
from
a
younger
man
jackson
secrecy
was
often
irritating
men
who
were
thought
it
implied
a
want
of
confidence
those
overburdened
with
dignity
objected
to
being
treated
like
the
private
soldiers
and
those
of
superior
wisdom
were
injured
because
their
advice
was
not
asked
before
the
march
to
richmond
there
was
much
discontent
general
whiting
on
reaching
staunton
with
his
division
rode
at
once
to
port
republic
to
report
the
distance
says
general
imboden
was
twenty
miles
and
whiting
returned
after
midnight
he
was
in
a
towering
passion
and
declared
that
jackson
had
treated
him
outrageously
i
asked
is
that
possible
general
he
is
very
polite
to
everyone
hang
him
he
was
polite
enough
but
he
did
say
one
word
about
his
plans
i
finally
asked
him
for
orders
telling
him
what
troops
i
had
he
simply
told
me
to
go
back
to
staunton
and
he
would
send
me
orders
i
have
the
slightest
idea
what
they
will
be
i
believe
he
has
no
more
sense
than
my
horse
battles
and
leaders
page
the
orders
when
they
came
simply
directed
him
to
take
his
troops
by
railway
to
gordonsville
through
which
they
had
passed
two
days
before
and
gave
no
reason
whatever
for
the
movement
general
whiting
was
not
the
only
confederate
officer
who
was
mystified
when
the
troops
left
the
valley
not
a
single
soul
in
the
army
save
jackson
alone
knew
the
object
of
their
march
he
had
even
gone
out
of
his
way
to
blind
his
most
trusted
subordinates
during
the
preceding
afternoon
says
major
hotchkiss
he
sent
for
me
to
his
tent
and
asked
me
to
bring
maps
of
the
country
from
port
republic
to
lexington
at
the
head
of
the
valley
as
he
wished
to
examine
them
i
took
the
map
to
his
tent
and
for
about
half
an
hour
we
talked
concerning
the
roads
and
streams
and
points
of
offence
and
defence
of
that
region
just
as
though
he
had
in
mind
a
march
in
that
direction
after
this
interval
had
passed
he
thanked
me
and
said
that
that
would
do
about
half
an
hour
later
he
sent
for
me
again
and
remarked
that
there
had
been
some
fighting
down
about
richmond
referring
of
course
to
the
battle
of
seven
pines
and
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
map
of
the
field
of
the
operations
i
brought
the
maps
of
the
district
round
richmond
and
we
spent
nearly
twice
as
much
time
over
those
talking
about
the
streams
the
roads
the
condition
of
the
country
and
so
forth
on
retiring
to
my
tent
i
said
to
myself
old
jack
is
going
to
richmond
letter
to
the
author
even
the
faithful
dabney
was
left
in
the
dark
till
the
troops
had
reached
mechum
station
there
calling
him
into
a
room
in
the
hotel
the
general
locked
the
door
and
explained
the
object
of
his
march
but
it
was
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
ewell
the
second
in
command
complained
to
the
chief
of
the
staff
that
jackson
had
gone
off
by
train
leaving
him
without
orders
or
even
a
hint
of
what
was
in
the
wind
in
fact
a
few
days
after
the
battle
of
port
republic
ewell
had
sent
some
of
his
staff
on
leave
of
absence
telling
them
that
large
reinforcements
were
coming
up
and
that
the
next
move
would
be
to
beat
up
banks
quarters
about
strasburg
when
jackson
was
informed
of
the
irritation
of
his
generals
he
merely
smiled
and
said
if
i
can
deceive
my
own
friends
i
can
make
certain
of
deceiving
the
enemy
nothing
shook
his
faith
in
frederick
the
great
maxim
which
he
was
fond
of
quoting
if
i
thought
my
coat
knew
my
plans
i
would
take
it
off
and
burn
it
an
anecdote
told
by
one
of
his
brigadiers
illustrates
his
reluctance
to
say
more
than
necessary
previous
to
the
march
to
richmond
this
officer
met
jackson
riding
through
staunton
colonel
said
the
general
have
you
received
the
order
no
sir
want
you
to
march
when
sir
now
which
way
get
in
the
cars
go
with
lawton
how
must
i
send
my
train
and
the
battery
by
the
road
well
general
i
hate
to
ask
questions
but
it
is
impossible
to
send
my
waggons
off
without
knowing
which
road
to
send
them
oh
laughing
send
them
by
the
road
the
others
go
at
last
when
they
saw
how
constant
fortune
was
to
their
reticent
leader
his
subordinates
ceased
to
complain
but
unfortunately
there
was
another
source
of
trouble
jackson
had
no
regard
whatever
for
persons
reversing
the
usual
procedure
he
held
that
the
choleric
word
of
the
soldier
was
rank
blasphemy
in
the
captain
the
higher
the
rank
of
the
offender
the
more
severe
in
his
opinion
should
be
the
punishment
not
only
did
he
hold
that
he
who
would
rule
others
must
himself
set
the
example
of
punctiliousness
but
that
to
whom
much
is
given
from
him
much
is
to
be
expected
honour
and
promotion
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
officer
his
name
is
associated
in
dispatches
with
the
valorous
deeds
of
he
command
while
the
private
soldier
fights
on
unnoticed
in
the
crowd
to
his
colonels
therefore
jackson
was
a
strict
master
and
stricter
to
his
generals
if
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
subordinates
were
indolent
or
disobedient
he
visited
their
shortcomings
with
a
heavy
hand
no
excuse
availed
arrest
and
report
followed
immediately
on
detection
and
if
the
cure
was
rude
the
plague
of
incompetency
was
radically
dealt
with
spirited
young
soldiers
proud
of
their
high
rank
and
in
no
way
underrating
their
own
capacity
rebelled
against
such
discipline
and
the
knowledge
that
they
were
closely
watched
that
their
omissions
would
be
visited
on
their
heads
with
unfaltering
severity
sometimes
created
a
barrier
between
them
and
their
commander
but
it
was
only
wilful
disobedience
or
actual
insubordination
that
roused
jackson
wrath
if
he
found
in
an
officer
says
dabney
a
hearty
and
zealous
purpose
to
do
all
his
duty
he
was
the
most
tolerant
and
gracious
of
superiors
overlooking
blunders
and
mistakes
with
unbounded
patience
and
repairing
them
through
his
own
exertions
without
even
a
sign
of
vexation
the
delay
at
the
bridge
on
the
morning
of
port
republic
so
fatal
to
his
design
of
crushing
fremont
caused
no
outburst
of
wrath
he
received
his
report
with
equanimity
regarding
the
accident
as
due
to
the
will
of
providence
and
therefore
to
be
accepted
without
complaint

whether
the
nobler
side
of
jackson
character
had
a
share
in
creating
the
confidence
which
his
soldiers
already
placed
in
him
must
be
matter
of
conjecture
it
was
well
known
in
the
ranks
that
he
was
superior
to
the
frailties
of
human
nature
that
he
was
as
thorough
a
christian
as
he
was
a
soldier
that
he
feared
the
world
as
little
as
he
did
the
enemy
his
devout
habits
were
no
secret
in
the
camp
jim
most
faithful
of
servants
declared
that
he
could
always
tell
when
there
was
going
to
be
a
battle
the
general
he
said
is
a
great
man
for
prayin
he
pray
night
and
morning
all
times
but
when
i
see
him
git
up
several
times
in
the
night
an
go
off
an
pray
den
i
know
there
is
goin
to
be
somethin
to
pay
an
i
go
right
away
and
pack
his
haversack
in
all
things
he
was
consistent
his
sincerity
was
as
clear
as
the
noonday
sun
and
his
faith
as
firmly
rooted
as
the
massanuttons
publicly
and
privately
in
official
dispatches
and
in
ordinary
conversation
the
success
of
his
army
was
ascribed
to
the
almighty
every
victory
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
was
followed
by
the
order
the
chaplains
will
hold
divine
service
in
their

the
general
commanding
ran
the
order
after
winchester
would
warmly
express
to
the
officers
and
men
under
his
command
his
joy
in
their
achievements
and
his
thanks
for
their
brilliant
gallantry
in
action
and
their
patient
obedience
under
the
hardships
of
forced
marches
often
more
painful
to
the
brave
soldier
than
the
danger
of
battle
the
explanation
of
the
severe
exertions
to
which
the
commanding
general
called
the
army
which
were
endured
by
them
with
such
cheerful
confidence
in
him
is
now
given
in
the
victory
of
yesterday
he
receives
this
proof
of
their
confidence
in
the
past
with
pride
and
gratitude
and
asks
only
a
similar
confidence
in
the
future
but
his
chief
duty
of
and
that
of
the
army
is
to
recognise
devoutly
the
hand
of
a
protecting
providence
in
the
brilliant
successes
of
the
last
three
days
which
have
given
us
the
results
of
a
great
victory
without
great
losses
and
to
make
the
oblation
of
our
thanks
to
god
for
his
service
to
us
and
our
country
in
heartfelt
acts
of
religious
worship
for
this
purpose
the

will
remain
in

suspending
as
far
as
possible
all
military
exercises
and

at

volume
pages
whenever
it
was
possible
sunday
was
always
set
apart
for
a
day
of
rest
and
the
claims
of
the
day
were
seldom
altogether
disregarded
sometimes
says
major
hotchkiss
jackson
would
keep
two
or
three
sundays
running
so
as
to
make
up
arrears
and
balance
the
account
on
the
morning
of
cross
keys
it
is
related
that
a
large
portion
of
elzey
brigade
were
at
service
and
that
the
crash
of
the
enemy
artillery
interrupted
the
thirdly
of
the
chaplain
sermon
it
has
been
sometimes
asserted
that
jackson
was
of
the
same
type
as
the
saints
militant
who
followed
cromwell
who
when
they
were
not
slaughtering
their
enemies
would
expound
the
harsh
tenets
of
their
unlovely
creed
to
the
grim
circle
of
belted
ironsides
he
has
been
described
as
taking
the
lead
at
religious
meetings
as
distributing
tracts
from
tent
to
tent
as
acting
as
to
his
chaplains
and
as
consigning
to
perdition
all
those
whose
doxy
was
not
his
doxy
nothing
is
further
from
the
truth
his
views
of
each
denomination
says
his
wife
had
been
obtained
from
itself
not
from
its
opponents
hence
he
could
see
excellences
in
all
even
of
the
roman
catholic
church
he
had
a
much
more
favourable
impression
than
most
protestants
and
he
fraternised
with
all
evangelical
denominations
during
a
visit
to
new
york
one
sabbath
morning
we
chanced
to
find
ourselves
at
the
door
of
an
episcopal
church
at
the
hour
of
worship
he
proposed
that
we
should
enter
and
as
it
was
a
day
for
the
celebration
of
the
communion
he
remained
for
that
service
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
reverence
and
solemnity
that
he
walked
up
the
chancel
and
knelt
to
receive
the
elements
jackson
then
was
by
no
means
imbued
with
the
belief
that
the
presbyterian
was
the
one
true
church
and
that
all
others
were
in
error
nor
did
he
attempt
in
the
very
slightest
degree
to
usurp
the
functions
of
his
chaplains
although
he
invariably
went
to
sleep
during
their
sermons
he
was
deeply
interested
in
their
endeavours
and
gave
them
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
but
he
no
more
thought
of
taking
their
duties
on
himself
than
of
interfering
with
the
treatment
of
the
men
in
hospital
he
spoke
no
words
in
season
even
to
his
intimates
he
had
no
message
for
them
where
religion
was
concerned
so
long
as
duly
qualified
instructors
were
available
he
conceived
it
his
business
to
listen
and
not
to
teach
morning
and
evening
prayers
were
the
rule
at
his
headquarters
but
if
any
of
his
staff
chose
to
remain
absent
the
general
made
no
remark
yet
all
suspicion
of
indifference
to
vice
was
effectually
removed
nothing
ungenerous
or
unclean
was
said
in
his
presence
without
incurring
his
displeasure
always
unmistakably
expressed
and
although
he
made
no
parade
of
his
piety
he
was
far
too
manly
to
hide
it
yet
he
was
never
a
prominent
figure
at
the
camp
services
rather
than
occupy
a
conspicuous
place
he
would
seat
himself
amongst
the
privates
and
the
only
share
he
took
in
directing
the
proceedings
was
to
beckon
men
to
the
seats
that
respect
had
left
empty
beside
him
those
who
picture
him
as
an
enthusiastic
fanatic
invading
like
the
puritan
dragoons
the
pulpits
of
the
chaplains
and
leading
the
devotions
of
his
troops
with
the
same
fervour
that
he
displayed
in
battle
have
utterly
misread
his
character
the
humblest
soldier
in
the
confederate
army
was
not
more
modest
and
unassuming
than
stonewall
jackson
note
the

that
on

he
had

which
deducting
guards

and
stragglers
were
reduced
to
combatants
at

but
he
does
not
include
in
this
last
estimate
bayard
cavalry
which
joined
him
at
strasburg
on
may
bayard
had
officers
and
men
he
had
suffered
some
loss
in
fighting
ashby
and
his
strength
at
the
battle
may
be
put
down
as
all
garrisons
guards
and
working
parties
are
included
in
the
confederate
numbers
so
they
should
be
added
to
the
federal
estimate
we
may
fairly
say
then
that

the

shifts
is
very
different
from

valley
from
the

banks
of
the

sixty
miles
north
of
richmond
to
the
shining
reaches
of
the
james
where
the
capital
of
the
confederacy
stands
high
on
her
seven
hills
the
lowlands
of
virginia
are
clad
with
luxuriant
vegetation
the
roads
and
railways
run
through
endless
avenues
of
stately
trees
the
shadows
of
the
giant
oaks
lie
far
across
the
rivers
and
ridge
and
ravine
are
mantled
with
the
unbroken
foliage
of
the
primeval
forest
in
this
green
wilderness
the
main
armies
were
involved
but
despite
the
beauty
of
broad
rivers
and
sylvan
solitudes
gay
with
gorgeous
blossoms
and
fragrant
with
aromatic
shrubs
the
eastern
or
tidewater
counties
of
virginia
had
little
to
recommend
them
as
a
theatre
of
war
they
were
sparsely
settled
the
wooden
churches
standing
lonely
in
the
groves
where
the
congregations
hitched
their
horses
the
solitary
taverns
half
inns
and
half
stores
the
of
the
county
justices
with
a
few
wooden
cottages
clustered
round
them
were
poor
substitutes
for
the
of
the
shenandoah
here
and
there
on
the
higher
levels
surrounded
by
coppice
and
lawn
by
broad
acres
of
corn
and
clover
the
manors
of
the
planters
gave
life
and
brightness
to
the
landscape
but
the
men
were
fighting
in
lee
ranks
their
families
had
fled
to
richmond
and
these
hospitable
homes
showed
signs
of
poverty
and
neglect
neither
food
nor
forage
was
to
be
drawn
from
the
country
and
the
difficulties
of
supply
and
shelter
were
not
the
worst
obstacles
to
military
operations
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
climate
and
the
soil
were
persistent
foes
the
roads
were
mere
tracks
channels
which
served
as
drains
for
the
interminable
forest
the
deep
meadows
fresh
and
green
to
the
eye
were
damp
and
unwholesome
turgid
streams
like
the
chickahominy
and
its
affluents
winding
sluggishly
through
rank
jungles
spread
in
swamp
and
morass
across
the
valleys
and
the
languid
atmosphere
surcharged
with
vapour
was
redolent
of
decay
june
through
this
malarious
region
the
federal
army
had
been
pushing
its
slow
way
forward
for
more
than
six
weeks
and
men
accompanied
by
a
large
siege
train
lay
intrenched
within
sight
of
the
spires
of
richmond
were
north
of
the
chickahominy
covering
the
york
river
railway
and
waiting
the
coming
of
mcdowell
the
remainder
from
woodbury
bridge
to
the
charles
city
road
occupied
the
line
of
breastworks
which
stood
directly
east
of
the
beleaguered
city
so
nearly
was
the
prize
within
their
grasp
that
the
church
bells
and
even
the
clocks
striking
the
hour
were
heard
in
the
camps
and
at
mechanicsville
bridge
watched
by
a
picket
stood
a
which
bore
the
legend
to
richmond
miles
the
sentries
who
paced
that
beat
were
fortunate
for
the
next
two
years
they
could
boast
that
no
federal
soldier
except
as
a
prisoner
had
stood
so
close
as
they
had
to
the
rebel
stronghold
but
during
these
weeks
in
june
not
a
single
soul
in
mcclellan
army
and
few
in
the
confederacy
suspected
that
the
flood
of
invasion
had
reached
mark
richmond
gazing
night
after
night
at
the
red
glow
which
throbbed
on
the
eastern
vault
the
reflection
of
countless
and
listening
with
strained
ears
to
the
call
of
hostile
bugles
seemed
in
perilous
case
no
formidable
position
protected
the
approaches
earthworks
indeed
were
in
process
of
construction
but
although
the
left
flank
at
new
bridge
was
covered
by
the
chickahominy
the
right
was
protected
by
no
natural
obstacle
as
had
been
the
case
at
yorktown
and
the
lines
occupied
no
commanding
site
nor
had
the
government
been
able
to
assemble
an
army
of
a
strength
sufficient
to
man
the
whole
front
lee
until
jackson
joined
him
commanded
no
more
than
men
of
these
a
large
portion
were
new
troops
and
their
numbers
had
been
reduced
by
the
dispatched
under
whiting
to
the
valley
june
but
if
the
federal
army
was
far
superior
in
numbers
it
was
not
animated
by
an
energy
in
proportion
to
its
strength
the
march
from
the
white
house
was
more
sluggish
than
the
current
of
the
chickahominy
from
may
to
june
the
army
of
the
valley
had
covered
four
hundred
miles
within
the
same
period
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
covered
twenty
it
is
true
that
the
circumstances
were
widely
different
mcclellan
had
in
front
of
him
the
lines
of
richmond
and
his
advance
had
been
delayed
by
the
rising
of
the
chickahominy
he
had
fought
a
hard
fight
at
seven
pines
and
the
constant
interference
of
jackson
had
kept
him
waiting
for
mcdowell
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
displayed
an
excess
of
caution
which
was
perfectly
apparent
to
his
astute
opponent
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
use
his
superior
numbers
and
lee
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
attack
on
richmond
would
take
the
same
form
as
the
attack
on
yorktown
the
establishment
of
great
batteries
the
massing
of
heavy
ordnance
and
all
the
tedious
processes
of
a
siege
he
read
mcclellan
like
an
open
book
he
had
personal
knowledge
both
of
his
capacity
and
character
for
they
had
served
together
on
the
same
staff
in
the
mexican
war
he
knew
that
his
young
adversary
was
a
man
of
undoubted
ability
of
fascinating
address
and
of
courage
that
was
never
higher
than
when
things
were
at
their
worst
but
these
useful
qualities
were
accompanied
by
marked
defects
his
will
was
less
powerful
than
his
imagination
bold
in
conception
he
was
terribly
slow
in
execution
when
his
good
sense
showed
him
the
opportunity
his
imagination
whispered
suppose
the
enemy
has
reserves
of
which
i
know
nothing
is
it
not
more
prudent
to
wait
until
i
receive
more
accurate
information
and
so
i
dare
not
inevitably
waited
on
i
would
he
forgot
that
in
war
it
is
impossible
for
a
general
to
be
absolutely
certain
it
is
sufficient
according
to
napoleon
if
the
odds
in
his
favour
are
three
to
two
and
if
he
can
not
discover
from
the
attitude
of
his
enemy
what
the
odds
are
he
is
unfitted
for
supreme
command
before
yorktown
mcclellan
five
army
corps
had
been
held
in
check
first
by
men
then
by
protected
by
earthworks
of
feeble
profile
no
one
but
mcclellan
would
have
hesitated
to
attack
johnston

and
mcclellan
however
although
a
division
was
actually
under
orders
to
move
against
it
appears
to
have
been
unwilling
to
risk
a
failure
the
garrison
consisted
only
of
a
few
companies
of
heavy
artillery
and
the
principal
work
was
still
unfinished
when
yorktown
fell

of
comstock
and
colonel
cabell
volume
part
the
channel
of
the
york
was
thus
closed
both
to
his
transports
and
the
gunboats
and
he
did
nothing
whatever
to
interfere
with
johnston
long
line
of
communications
which
passed
at
several
points
within
easy
reach
of
the
river
bank
nor
had
he
been
more
active
since
he
had
reached
west
point
except
for
a
single
expedition
which
had
dispersed
a
confederate
division
near
hanover
court
house
north
of
the
chickahominy
he
had
made
no
aggressive
movement
he
had
never
attempted
to
test
the
strength
of
the
fortifications
of
richmond
to
hinder
their
construction
or
to
discover
their
weak
points
his
urgent
demands
for
reinforcements
had
appeared
in
the
northern
newspapers
and
those
newspapers
had
found
their
way
to
richmond
from
the
same
source
the
confederates
were
made
aware
that
he
believed
himself
confronted
by
an
army
far
larger
than
his
own
and
when
on
the
departure
of
whiting
division
for
the
valley
he
refused
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
attack
diminished
force
it
became
abundantly
clear
if
further
proof
were
wanting
that
much
might
be
ventured
against
so
timid
a
commander
from
his
knowledge
of
his
adversary
character
and
still
more
from
his
attitude
lee
had
little
difficulty
in
discovering
his
intentions
mcclellan
on
the
other
hand
failed
to
draw
a
single
correct
inference
and
yet
the
information
at
his
disposal
was
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
form
a
fair
estimate
of
how
things
stood
in
the
confederate
camp
he
had
been
attacked
at
seven
pines
but
not
by
superior
numbers
and
it
was
hardly
likely
that
the
enemy
had
not
employed
their
whole
available
strength
in
this
battle
otherwise
their
enterprise
was
insensate
furthermore
it
was
clearly
to
the
interests
of
the
confederates
to
strike
at
his
army
before
mcdowell
could
join
him
they
had
not
done
so
and
it
was
therefore
probable
that
they
did
not
feel
themselves
strong
enough
to
do
so
it
is
true
that
he
was
altogether
misled
by
the
intelligence
supplied
as
to
the
garrison
of
richmond
by
his
famous
detective
staff
was
the
smallest
number
which
the
chief
agent
would
admit
but
that
mcclellan
should
have
relied
on
the
estimate
of
these
untrained
observers
rather
than
on
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
conduct
of
the
enemy
is
but
a
further
proof
that
he
lacked
all
power
of
deduction
in
one
sense
mcclellan
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
the
confederate
numbers
in
assuming
control
of
the
union
armies
lincoln
and
stanton
made
their
enemies
a
present
of
at
least
men
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
he
was
anxious
at
heart
to
measure
swords
with
lee
his
knowledge
of
his
adversary
whose
reputation
for
daring
for
ability
for
strength
of
purpose
had
been
higher
than
any
other
in
the
old
army
must
needs
have
had
a
disturbing
influence
on
his
judgment
against
an
enemy
he
did
not
know
mcclellan
might
have
acted
with
resolution
face
to
face
with
lee
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
weaker
will
was
dominated
by
the
stronger
vastly
different
were
their
methods
of
war
mcclellan
made
no
effort
whatever
either
to
supplement
or
to
corroborate
the
information
supplied
by
his
detectives
since
he
had
reached
west
point
his
cavalry
had
done
little
it
must
be
admitted
that
his
cavalry
was
very
weak
in
proportion
to
the
other
arms
on
june
he
had
just
over
sabres
volume
part
page
of
which
were
distributed
among
the
army
corps
the
confederates
appear
to
have
had
about
but
of
superior
quality
familiar
more
or
less
with
the
country
and
united
under
one
command
it
is
instructive
to
notice
how
the
necessity
for
a
numerous
cavalry
grew
on
the
federal
commanders
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
accompanied
by
a
cavalry
corps
over
strong
with
guns
it
is
generally
the
case
in
war
even
in
a
close
country
that
if
the
cavalry
is
allowed
to
fall
below
the
usual
proportion
of
one
trooper
to
every
six
men
of
the
other
arms
the
army
suffers
lee
on
the
other
hand
had
found
means
to
ascertain
the
disposition
of
his
adversary
troops
and
had
acquired
ample
information
of
the
measures
which
had
been
taken
to
protect
the
right
wing
north
of
the
chickahominy
the
point
he
had
determined
to
attack
june
early
on
june
with
horsemen
and
a
section
of
artillery
stuart
rode
out
on
an
enterprise
of
a
kind
which
at
that
time
was
absolutely
unique
and
which
will
keep
his
memory
green
so
long
as
cavalry
is
used
in
war
carefully
concealing
his
march
be
encamped
that
night
near
taylorsville
miles
north
of
richmond
and
far
beyond
the
flank
of
the
federal
intrenchments
june
the
next
morning
he
turned
eastward
towards
hanover
court
house
here
he
drove
back
a
picket
and
his
advanced
guard
with
the
loss
of
one
officer
soon
afterwards
charged
down
a
squadron
of
regulars
a
few
miles
to
the
near
old
church
the
enemy
outposts
were
finally
dispersed
and
then
instead
of
halting
the
column
pushed
on
into
the
very
heart
of
the
district
occupied
by
the
federals
and
soon
found
itself
in
rear
of
their
encampments
stuart
had
already
gained
important
information
he
had
learned
that
mcclellan
right
flank
extended
but
a
short
way
north
of
the
chickahominy
that
it
was
not
fortified
and
that
it
rested
on
neither
swamp
nor
stream
and
this
was
what
lee
had
instructed
him
to
discover
but
it
was
one
thing
to
obtain
the
information
another
to
bring
it
back
if
he
returned
by
the
road
he
had
come
it
was
probable
he
would
be
cut
off
for
the
enemy
was
thoroughly
roused
and
the
south
anna
river
unfordable
from
recent
rains
rendered
a
detour
to
the
north
impracticable
to
the
mouth
and
west
of
him
lay
the
federal
army
some
of
the
infantry
camps
not
five
miles
distant
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
he
could
hardly
reach
hanover
court
house
before
dark
and
he
might
find
it
held
by
the
enemy
to
escape
from
the
dilemma
he
determined
on
a
plan
of
extraordinary
daring
which
involved
nothing
less
than
the
passage
of
the
chickahominy
in
rear
of
the
enemy
and
a
circuit
of
the
entire
federal
army
the
audacity
of
the
design
proved
the
salvation
of
his
command
the
enemy
had
assembled
a
strong
force
of
both
cavalry
and
infantry
at
hanover
court
house
under
stuart
general
cooke
but
misled
by
the
reports
brought
in
and
doubtless
perplexed
by
the
situation
the
latter
pursued
but
slowly
and
halted
for
the
night
at
old
church
stuart
meanwhile
had
reached
tunstall
station
on
the
york
river

picking
up
prisoners
at
every
step

guard
he
tore
up
the
rails
destroyed
a
vast
amount
of
stores
and
many
waggons
broke
down
the
telegraph
and
burnt
the
railway

themselves
on

luxuries
which
were
found
in

fire
to

and
rejoined
with
a
large
number
of
prisoners
horses
and

then
led
by
troopers
who
were
natives
of
the
country
the
column
marched
by
the
williamsburg
road
moving
further
and
still
further
away
from
richmond
the
moon
was
full
and
as
the
troops
passed
by
the
forest
farms
the
women
running
to
the
wayside
wept
with
delight
at
the
unexpected
apparition
of
the
grey
jackets
and
old
men
showered
blessings
on
the
heads
of
their
gallant
countrymen
at
talleysville
eight
miles
east
stuart
halted
for
three
hours
and
shortly
after
midnight
just
as
a
federal
infantry
brigade
reached
tunstall

in
hot
pursuit
he
turned
off
by
a
country
road
to
the
chickahominy

at

where
he
arrived
at
daylight
he
should
have
found

overflowed
its

was
full
of

member
of

peril
over
to
the
other
bank
but
although
he
the
swollen
waters
in
the
same
manner
the
daring
young
officer
had
to
report
that
the
passage
was
impracticable
it
was
already
light
the
enemy
would
soon
be
up
and
the
capture
of
the
whole
column
seemed
absolutely
certain
hitherto
the
men
exhilarated
by
the
complete
success
of
the
adventure
had
borne
themselves
as
gaily
as
if
they
were
riding
through
the
streets
of
richmond
but
the
danger
of
their
situation
was
now
forcibly
impressed
upon
them
and
the
whole
command
became
grave
and
anxious
stuart
alone
was
unmoved
and
at
this
juncture
one
of
his
scouts
informed
him
that
the
skeleton
of
an
old
bridge
spanned
the
stream
about
a
mile
below
an
abandoned
warehouse
furnished
the
materials
for
a
footway
over
which
the
troopers
passed
holding
the
bridles
of
their
horses
as
they
swam
alongside
half
the
column
thus
crossed
while
the
remainder
strengthened
the
bridge
so
as
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
artillery
by
one
the
whole
force
was
over
the
chickahominy
unmolested
by
the
enemy
of
whom
only
small
parties
easily
driven
back
by

made
their
appearance

now
to

in

of
the

some
portion
of

with
a
wave
of
the

covered

plunged
into
the
woods
and
without
further
misadventure
brought
his
troops
at
sunset
to
the
neighbourhood

with
them

this

even
after

arrival

the

by

the
left
rested
on
white
oak
swamp
a
network
of
sluggish
streams
and
impassable

screened

it
needed
not
the
presence

placed
on
the
most
commanding
points
within
the
lines
to
make
such
a
position
absolutely
impregnable

however
the
federals
were
less
favourably
situated
the

under
general
fitzjohn
porter
had
been
pushed
forward
stretching
a
hand
to
mcdowell
and
protecting
the
railway
in
the
direction
of
mechanicsville
and
although
the
tributaries
of
the
chickahominy
running
in
from
the
north
afforded
a
series
of
positions
the
right
flank
of
these
positions
resting
as
stuart
had
ascertained
on
no
natural
obstacle
was
open
to
a
turning
movement
furthermore
in
rear
of
the
fifth
corps
and
at
an
oblique
angle
to
the
front
ran
the
line
of
supply
the
railway
to
west
point
if
porter
right
were
turned
the
confederates
threatening
the
railway
would
compel
mcclellan
to
detach
largely
to
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
in
order
to
recover
or
protect
the
line
on
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
therefore
lee
attention
had
been
for
some
time
fixed
here
was
his
adversary
weak
point
and
a
sudden
assault
on
porter
followed
up
if
necessary
by
an
advance
against
the
railway
would
bring
mcclellan
out
of
his
intrenchments
and
force
him
to
fight
at
a
disadvantage
to
ensure
success
however
in
the
attack
on
porter
it
was
necessary
to
concentrate
an
overwhelming
force
on
the
north
bank
and
this
could
hardly
be
done
without
so
weakening
the
force
which
held
the
richmond
lines
that
it
would
be
unable
to
resist
the
attack
of
the
men
who
faced
it
if
mcclellan
while
lee
was
fighting
porter
boldly
threw
forward
the
great
army
he
had
on
the
south
bank
the
rebel
capital
might
be
the
reward
of
his
resolution
the
danger
was
apparent
to
all
but
lee
resolved
to
risk
it
and
his
audacity
has
not
escaped
criticism
it
has
been
said
that
he
deliberately
disregarded
the
contingency
of
mcclellan
either
advancing
on
richmond
or
reinforcing
porter
the
truth
is
however
that
neither
lee
nor
those
generals
about
him
who
knew
mcclellan
were
in
the
least
apprehensive
that
their
adversary
if
the
attack
were
sudden
and
well
sustained
would
either
see
or
utilise
his
opportunity
from
hannibal
to
moltke
there
has
been
no
great
captain
who
has
neglected
to
study
the
character
of
his
opponent
and
who
did
not
trade
on
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
and
it
was
this
knowledge
which
justified
lee
audacity
the
real
daring
of
the
enterprise
lay
in
the
inferiority
of
the
confederate
armament
muskets
and
still
carried
by
a
large
part
of
the
army
were
against
rifles
of
the
most
modern
manufacture
while
the
with
which
at
least
half
the
artillery
was
equipped
possessed
neither
the
range
nor
the
accuracy
of
the
rifled
ordnance
of
the
federals
that
lee
study
of
the
chances
had
not
been
patient
and
exhaustive
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
he
was
no
leader
but
a
profound
thinker
following
the
highest
principles
of
the
military
art
that
he
had
weighed
the
disconcerting
effect
which
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
victorious
jackson
with
an
army
of
unknown
strength
would
produce
upon
mcclellan
goes
without
saying
he
had
omitted
no
precaution
to
render
the
surprise
complete
and
although
the
defences
of
richmond
were
still
too
weak
to
resist
a
resolute
attack
magruder
the
same
officer
who
had
so
successfully
imposed
upon
mcclellan
at
yorktown
was
such
a
master
of
artifice
that
with
men
and
the
reserve

magruder

huger

had
been
disposed
of

of
the

the
two

men
all
told
crossing
to
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
and
combining
with
the
under
jackson
would
be
sufficient
to
crush
the
federal
right
the
initial
operations
however
were
of
a
somewhat
complicated
nature
four

either
been

at

afterwards

three
and
a
half
miles
below
mechanicsville

is
new
bridge
the
northern
approaches
to
mechanicsville
meadow
and
new
bridge
were
in
possession
of
the
federals
and
it
was
consequently
no
simple
operation
to
transfer
the
troops
before
richmond
from
one
bank
of
the
chickahominy
to
the
other
only
mechanicsville
and
meadow
bridges
could
be
used
winston
bridge
was
too
far
from
richmond
for
if
longstreet
and
the
two
hills
were
to
cross
at
that
point
not
only
would
magruder
be
left
without
support
during
their
march
but
mcclellan
warned
by
his
scouts
would
receive
long
notice
of
the
intended
blow
and
have
ample
time
for
preparation
to
surprise
porter
to
give
mcclellan
no
time
for
reflection
and
at
the
same
time
to
gain
a
position
which
would
bring
the
confederates
operating
on
the
north
bank
into
close
and
speedy
communication
with
magruder
on
the
south
another
point
of
passage
must
be
chosen
the
position
would
be
the
one
commanding

the
confederate
earthworks
held
by
magruder
ran
due
south
from

but
porter
was
already
in
possession
of
the
coveted
ground
with
strong
outposts
at
mechanicsville
to
secure
then
the
two
centre
bridges
was
the
first
object
this
it

the

by

meadow

strike

that

seldom
runs
with
the
smoothness
of
clockwork
the
course
of

can
never
be
exactly
predicted
unforeseen
obstacles
may
render
the
highest
skill
and
the
most
untiring
energy
of
no
avail
and
it
may
be
well
to
point
out
that
the
task
which
was
assigned
to
jackson
was
one
of
exceeding
difficulty
in
the
first
place
his
march
of
miles
from
frederickshall
to
ashland
on
june
and
was
made
over
an
unmapped
country
unknown
either
to
himself
or
to
his
staff
which
had
lately
been
in
occupation
of
the
federals
bridges
had
been
destroyed
and
roads
obstructed
the
valley
army
had
already
marched
far
and
fast
and
although
dabney
hints
that
inexperienced
and
sluggish
subordinates
were
the
chief
cause
of
delay
there
is
hardly
need
to
look
so
far
for
excuse
white
in
his
excellent
life
of
lee
states
that
the
tardiness
of
the
arrival
of
the
provisions
sent
him
from
richmond
had
much
to
do
with
the
delay
of
march
the
march
from
ashland
to
hundley
corner
sixteen
miles
was
little
less
difficult
it
was
made
in
two
columns

this

the
midsummer

blazed

on
the
dusty
roads
the
dense
woods
on
either
hand
shut
out
the

and

were
frequent

skirmishing

the

and
there
the

were
obstructed

a
burned
bridge
over

the

for

full
hour

it

it
is

to
say
that
he
was

had
mcclellan
received
notice
that
the

approaching

would
have
given
him
a
fine
opportunity
more
than

might

intrenchments
on

bank
of
the

and
have
brought
over
large
reinforcements

and

or
he
might
have
turned
the
tables
by
a
bold
advance
on
richmond
it
was
by
no
means
inconceivable
that
if
he
detected

intention
and
was
given
time
to
prepare
he
might
permit
the
confederates
to
cross
the
chickahominy
amuse
them
there
with
a
small
force
and
hurl
the
rest
of
his
army
on
the
works
which
covered
the
southern
capital
it
is
true
that
his
caution
was
extreme
and
to
a
mind
which
was
more
occupied
with
counting
the
enemy
strength
than
with
watching
for
an
opportunity
the
possibility
of
assuming
the
offensive
was
not
likely
to
occur
but
timid
as
he
might
be
when
no
enemy
was
in
sight
mcclellan
was
constitutionally
brave
and
when
the
chimeras
raised
by
an
imagination
proved
to
be
substantial
dangers
he
was
quite
capable
of
daring
resolution
time
therefore
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
confederates
it
was
essential
that
porter
should
be
overwhelmed
before
mcclellan
realised
the
danger
and
if
jackson
in
fixing
a
date
for
the
attack
which
would
put
a
heavy
tax
on
the
marching
powers
of
his
men
already
strained
to
the
utmost
ran
some
risks
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
those
risks
were
fully
justified
in
the
second
place
an
operation
such
as
that
which
lee
had
devised
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
manoeuvres
which
an
army
can
be
called
upon
to
execute
according
to
moltke
to
unite
two
forces
on
the
starting
at
some
distance
apart
at
the
right
moment
is
the
most
brilliant
feat
of
generalship
the
slightest
hesitation
may
ruin
the
combination
haste
is
even
more
to
be
dreaded
there
is
always
the
danger
that
one
wing
may
attack
or
be
attacked
while
the
other
is
still
far
distant
and
either
contingency
may
be
fatal
the
valley
campaign
furnishes
more
than
one
illustration
in
their
pursuit

fremont

and
greater

or

have

better

eylau
and

napoleon
was
deprived
of
decisive
victory
by
his
failure
to
ensure
the
of
his
widely
separated
columns
jackson
and
hill
on
the
morning
of
the
were
nearly
fifteen
miles
apart
intercommunication
at
the
outset
was
ensured
by
the
brigade
under
branch
but
as
the
advance
progressed
and
the
enemy
was
met
with
it
became
more
difficult
the
messengers
riding
from
one
force
to
the
other
were
either
stopped
by
the
federals
or
were
compelled
to
make
long
detours
and
as
they
approached
the
enemy
position
neither
hill
nor
jackson
was
informed
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
other
the
truth
is
that
the
arrangements
made
by
the
confederate
headquarter
staff
were
most
inadequate
in
the
first
place
the
order
of
the
instructing
jackson
to
start
from
slash
church
at
on
the
and
thus
leading
the
other
generals
to
believe
that
he
would
certainly
be
there
at
that
hour
should
never
have
been
issued
when
it
was
written
jackson
advanced
guard
was
at
beaver
dam
station
the
rear
brigades
fifteen
miles
behind
and
to
reach
slash
church
his
force
had
to
march
forty
miles
through
an
intricate
country
in
possession
of
the
enemy
and
so
little
known
that
it
was
impossible
to
designate
the
route
to
be
followed
to
fix
an
hour
of
arrival
so
long
in
advance
was
worse
than
useless
and
jackson
can
not
be
blamed
if
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
exact
letter
of
a
foolish
order
as
it
was
so
many
of
the
bridges
were
broken
and
so
difficult
was
it
to
pass
the
fords
that
if
dabney
had
not
found
in
his
brother
a
planter
of
the
neighbourhood
an
efficient
substitute
for
the
guide
headquarters
should
have
provided
the
valley
army
would
have
been
not
hours
but
days
too
late
in
the
second
place
the
duty
of
keeping
up
communications
should
not
have
been
left
to
jackson
but
have
been
seen
to
at
headquarters
jackson
had
with
him
only
a
few
cavalry
and
these
few
had
not
only
to
supply
the
necessary
orderlies
for
the
subordinate
generals
and
the
escorts
for
the
artillery
and
trains
but
to
form
his
advanced
guard
for
stuart
squadrons
were
on
his
left
flank
and
not
in
his
front
moreover
his
cavalry
were
complete
strangers
to
the
country
and
there
were
no
maps
in
such
circumstances
the
only
means
of
ensuring
constant
communication
was
to
have
detached
two
of
squadrons
who
knew
the
ground
to
establish
a
series
of
posts
between
jackson
line
of
march
and
the
chickahominy
and
to
have
detailed
a
staff
officer
whose
sole
duty
would
have
been
to
furnish
the
with
hourly
reports
of
the
progress
made
to
join
the
valley
army
of
the
events
of
june
dabney
in
a
letter
to
the
author
writes
as
follows
here
we
had
a
disastrous
illustration
of
the
lack
of
an
organised
and
intelligent
general
staff
let
my
predicament
serve
as
a
specimen
as
chief
of
staff
i
had
two
assistant
two
men
of
the
engineer
department
and
two
clerks
what
did
i
have
for
orderlies
and
couriers
a
detail
from
some
cavalry
company
which
happened
to
bivouac
near
the
men
were
sent
to
me
without
any
reference
to
their
local
knowledge
their
intelligence
or
their
courage
most
probably
they
were
selected
for
me
by
their
captain
on
account
of
their
lack
of
these
qualities
next
to
the
the
chief
of
the
general
staff
should
be
the
best
man
in
the
country
the
brains
of
an
army
should
be
in
the
general
staff
the
lowest
orderlies
attached
to
it
should
be
the
very
best
soldiers
in
the
service
for
education
intelligence
and
courage
jackson
had
to
find
his
own
guide
for
his
march
from
beaver
dam
station
he
had
not
been
furnished
with
a
map
and
not
a
single
orderly
or
message
reached
him
during
the
whole
day
it
may
be
remarked
too
that
generals
branch
and
ewell
following
converging
roads
met
near
shady
grove
church
about
no
report
appears
to
have
been
sent
by
the
latter
to
general
hill
and
although
branch
a
little
later
received
a
message
to
the
effect
that
hill
had
crossed
the
chickahominy
and
was
moving
on
mechanicsville
branch
report
volume
part
page
the
information
was
not
passed
on
to
jackson
neglect
of
these
precautions
made
it
impracticable
to
arrange
a
simultaneous
attack
and
depended
solely
on
the
judgment
of
hill
and
jackson
in
the
action
which
ensued
on
beaver
dam
creek
there
was
no
whatever
hill
attacked
and
was
repulsed
jackson
had
halted
at
hundley
corner
three
miles
distant
from
the
had
the
latter
come
down
on
the
federal
rear
while
hill
moved
against
their
front
an
easy
success
would
in
all
probability
have
been
the
result
nevertheless
the
responsibility
for
hill
defeat
can
not
be
held
to
rest
on
jackson
shoulders
on
august
the
prussian
guards
and
the
saxon
army
corps
were
ordered
to
make
a
combined
attack
on
the
village
of
privat
the
guards
moving
against
the
front
the
saxons
against
the
flank
when
the
order
was
issued
the
two
corps
were
not
more
than
two
miles
apart
the
tract
of
country
which
lay
between
them
was
perfectly
open
the
roads
were
free
and
seemed
easy
in
the
extreme
yet
despite
their
orders
despite
the
facilities
of
communication
the
guards
advanced
to
the
attack
an
hour
and
a
half
too
soon
and
from
six
to
nearly
seven
their
shattered
lines
lay
in
front
of
the
position
at
the
mercy
of
a
vigorous
counterstroke
without
a
single
saxon
regiment
coming
to
their
aid
but
the
saxons
were
not
to
blame
their
march
had
been
unchecked
they
had
moved
at
speed
on
their
part
there
had
been
no
hesitation
but
on
the
part
of
the
commander
of
the
guards
there
had
been
the
same
precipitation
which
led
to
the
premature
attack
on
the
federal
position
at
beaver
dam
creek
it
was
the
impatience
of
general
hill
not
the
tardiness
of
jackson
which
was
the
cause
of
the
confederate
repulse
we
may
now
turn
to
the
question
whether
jackson
was
justified
in
not
marching
to
the
sound
of
the
cannon
referring
to
general
orders
it
will
be
seen
that
as
soon
as
longstreet
and
hill
had
crossed
the
chickahominy
the
four
divisions
of
the
army
were
to
move
forward
in
communication
with
each
other
and
drive
the
enemy
from
his
position
jackson
in
advance
upon
the
left
turning
beaver
dam
creek
and
taking
the
direction
of
cold
harbour
when
jackson
reached
hundley
corner
and
drove
the
federal
infantry
behind
the
creek
the
first
thing
to
do
as
his
orders
indicated
was
to
get
touch
with
the
rest
of
the
army
it
was
already
near
sunset
between
hundley
corner
and
mechanicsville
lay
a
dense
forest
with
no
roads
in
the
desired
direction
and
it
was
manifestly
impossible
under
ordinary
conditions
to
do
more
that
evening
than
to
establish
connection
the
combined
movement
against
the
enemy
position
must
be
deferred
till
the
morning
but
the
sound
of
battle
to
the
introduced
a
complication
we
distinctly
heard

jackson

rapid
and
continued

what

might
proceed
as
was
to
be
inferred
from

from
the
heavy
batteries
on
the
chickahominy
covering

passage
it
might
mean
a

counterstroke
on

possibly
a
premature

and
whatever
may
have
been
jackson
orders
it
was
undoubtedly
his
duty
if
he
believed
a
hot
engagement
was
in
progress
to
have
marched
to
the
assistance
of
his
colleagues
he
could
not
help
them
by
standing
still
he
might
have
rendered
them
invaluable
aid
by
pressing
the
enemy
in
flank
but
the
question
is
what
inference
did
the
cannonade
convey
to
jackson
mind
was
it
of
such
a
character
as
to
leave
no
doubt
that
hill
was
in
close
action
or
might
it
be
interpreted
as
the
natural
accompaniment
of
the
passage
of
the
chickahominy
the
evidence
is
conflicting
on
the
one
hand
we
have
the
evidence
of
whiting
and
trimble
both
experienced
soldiers
on
the
other
in
addition
to
the
indirect
evidence
of
jackson
inaction
we
have
the
statement
of
major
dabney
we
heard
no
signs
says
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
combat
on
beaver
dam
creek
until
a
little
while
before
sunset
the
whole
catastrophe
took
place
in
a
few
minutes
about
that
time
and
in
any
case
our
regiments
who
had
gone
into
bivouac
could
not
have
been
reassembled
formed
up
and
moved
forward
in
time
to
be
of
any
service
a
night
attack
through
the
dense
pathless
and
unknown
forest
was
quite
impracticable
letter
to
the
author
it
seems
probable
then
and
the
federal
reports
are
to
the
same
porter
report
volume

volume
page
that
the
firing
was
only
really
heavy
for
a
very
short
period
and
that
jackson
believed
it
to
be
occasioned
by
hill
passage
of
the
chickahominy
and
the
rout
of
the
federals
from
mechanicsville
neither
trimble
nor
whiting
were
aware
that
lee
orders
directed
that
the
operation
was
to
be
covered
by
a
heavy
cannonade
obeying
orders
very
literally
himself
jackson
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
others
did
not
do
the
same
he
knew
that
the
position
he
had
taken
up
rendered
the
line
of
beaver
dam
creek
untenable
by
the
federals
they
would
never
stand
to
fight
on
that
line
with
a
strong
force
established
in
their
rear
and
menacing
their
communications
nor
would
they
dare
to
deliver
a
counterstroke
through
the
trackless
woods
it
might
confidently
be
assumed
therefore
that
they
would
fall
back
during
the
night
and
that
the
confederate
advance
would
then
be
carried
out
in
that
concentrated
formation
which
lee
orders
had
dictated
such
in
all
probability
was
jackson
view
of
the
situation
and
that
hill
in
direct
contravention
of
those
orders
would
venture
on
an
isolated
attack
before
that
formation
had
been
assumed
never
for
a
moment
crossed
his
mind
longstreet
on
page
of
his

declares
that
jackson
marched
by
the
fight
without
giving
attention
and
went
into
camp
at
hundley
corner
half
a
mile
in
rear
of
the
enemy
position
a
reference
to
the
map
is
sufficient
to
expose
the
inaccuracy
of
this
statement
map
of
the
environs
of
richmond
hill
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
believed
that
if
the
federals
were
not
defeated
on
the
evening
of
the
they
would
make
use
of
the
respite
either
to
bring
up
reinforcements
or
to
advance
on
richmond
by
the
opposite
bank
of
the
chickahominy
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
thought
the
sound
of
his
cannon
would
bring
jackson
to
his
aid
that
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
establish
communication
and
to
make
certain
of
that
aid
before
attacking
there
can
be
no
question
it
was
too
late
to
defeat
porter
the
same
evening
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
immediate
attack
and
much
would
be
risked
the
last
assault
in
which
the
heaviest
losses
were
incurred
was
made
just
as
night
fell
it
was
a
sacrifice
of
life
as
unnecessary
as
that
of
the
prussian
guard
before
privat
at
the
same
time
that
general
hill
did
wrong
in
crossing
the
chickahominy
before
he
heard
of
his
colleague
approach
is
not
a
fair
accusation
to
have
lingered
on
the
south
bank
would
have
been
to
leave
jackson
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
federals
should
they
turn
against
him
in
the
forest
moreover
it
was
hill
task
to
open
a
passage
for
the
remaining
divisions
and
if
that
passage
had
been
deferred
to
a
later
hour
it
is
improbable
that
the
confederate
army
would
have
been
concentrated
on
the
north
bank
of
the
chickahominy
until
the
next
morning
it
must
be
admitted
too
that
the
situation
in
which
hill
found
himself
after
crossing
the
river
was
an
exceedingly
severe
test
of
his
his
troops
had
driven
in
the
federal
outposts
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
were
retiring
before
his
skirmishers
the
noise
of
battle
filled
the
air
from
across
the
chickahominy
thundered
the
heavy
guns
and
his
regiments
were
pressing
forward
with
the
impetuous
ardour
of
young
soldiers
if
he
yielded
to
the
excitement
of
the
moment
if
eagerness
for
battle
overpowered
his
judgment
if
his
brain
refused
to
work
calmly
in
the
wild
tumult
of
the
conflict
he
is
hardly
to
be
blamed
the
patience
which
is
capable
of
resisting
the
eagerness
of
the
troops
the
imperturbable
judgment
which
in
the
heat
of
action
weighs
with
deliberation
the
necessities
of
the
moment
the
clear
vision
which
forecasts
the
result
of
every
movement
these
are
rare
qualities
indeed
during
the
night
porter
fell
back
on
gaines
mill
while
the
engagement
at
beaver
dam
creek
was
still
in
progress
vast
clouds
of
dust
rising
above
the
forests
to
the
and
north
had
betrayed
the
approach
of
jackson
and
the
reports
of
the
cavalry
left
no
doubt
that
he
was
threatening
the
federal
rear
the
retreat
was
conducted
in
good
order
a
strong
reinforced
by
two
batteries
of
holding
the
confederates
in
check
and
before
morning
a
second
position
east
of
powhite
creek
and
covering
two
bridges
over
the
chickahominy
alexander
and
grapevine
was
occupied
by
the
fifth
army
corps
new
bridge
was
now
uncovered
and
lee
army
was
in
motion
shortly
after
sunrise
jackson
crossing

and
moving
due

the

however
had
already

and
the

well
concentrated
and
in

pushed
forward
in
pursuit
hill
with
longstreet
on
his
right
moving
on

while
jackson
supported
by
hill
and
with
stuart
covering
his

marched
by
a
more
circuitous
route
to

near

jackson
met
the
and
it
is
recorded
that
the
staff
officers
of

army
noting
the
eagerness
displayed
by
general
lee
suite
to
get
a
glimpse
of
stonewall
then
for
the
first
time
realised
the
true
character
and
magnitude
of
the
valley
campaign
noon
about
noon
after
a
march
of
seven
miles
hill
scouts
reported
that
the
federals
had
halted
behind
powhite
creek
the
leading
brigade
was
sent
across
the
stream
which
runs
past
gaines
mill
and
pressing
through
the
thick
woods
found
the
enemy
in
great
strength
on
a
ridge
beyond
hill
formed
his
division
for
attack
and
opened
fire
with
his
four
batteries
the
enemy
guns
superior
in
number
at
once
responded
and
the
skirmish
lines
became
actively
engaged
the
confederate
general
despite
urgent
messages
from
his
subordinates
requesting
permission
to
attack
held
his
troops
in
hand
waiting
till
he
should
be
supported
and
for
two
and
a
half
hours
the
battle
was
no
more
than
an
affair
of
long
bowls
the
position
held
by
the
defence
was
emphatically
one
to
impose
caution
on
the
assailants
to
reach
it
the
confederates
were
confined
to
three
roads
two
from
mechanicsville
and
one
from
old
cold
harbour
these
roads
led
each
of
them
through
a
broad
belt
of
forest
and
then
passing
through
open
fields
descended
into
a
winding
valley
from
five
hundred
to
a
thousand
yards
in
breadth
rising
near
mcgehee
house
due
south
of
old
cold
harbour
a
sluggish
creek
bordered
by
swamps
and
thick
timber
and
cutting
in
places
a
deep
channel
filtered
through
the
valley
to
the
chickahominy
beyond
this
stream
rose
an
open
and
undulating
plateau
admirably
adapted
to
the
movement
of
all
arms
and
with
a
slight
command
of
the
opposite
ridge
on
the
plateau
facing
west
and
north
the
federals
were
formed
up
a
fringe
of
trees
and
bushes
along
the
crest
gave
cover
and
concealment
to
the
troops
feet
below
winding
darkly
through
the
trees
the
creek
covered
the
whole
front
and
in
the
centre
of
the
position
east
of
new
cold
harbour
the
valley
was
completely
filled
with
tangled
wood
towards
old
cold
harbour
the
timber
on
the
confederate
side
of
the
ravine
was
denser
than
elsewhere
on
the
federal
left
flank
the
valley
of
the
chickahominy
was
open
ground
but
it
was
swept
by
heavy
guns
from
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
at
this
point
the
creek
became
an
almost
impassable
swamp
porter
who
had
been
reinforced
by
men
under
general
slocum
now
commanded
three
divisions
of
infantry
four
regiments
of
cavalry
and
batteries
a
total
of
officers
and
men
the
morale
of
the
troops
had
been
strengthened
by
their
easy
victory
of
the
previous
day
their
commander
had
gained
their
confidence
their
position
had
been
partially
intrenched
and
they
could
be
readily
supported
by
way
of
alexander
and
grapevine
bridges
from
the
south
bank
of
the
chickahominy
the
task
before
the
confederates
even
with
their
superior
numbers
was
formidable
in
the
extreme
the
wooded
ridge
which
encircled
the
position
afforded
scant
room
for
artillery
and
it
was
thus
impracticable
to
prepare
the
attack
by
a
preliminary
bombardment
the
ground
over
which
the
infantry
must
advance
was
completely
swept
by
fire
and
the
centre
and
left
were
defended
by
three
tiers
of
riflemen
the
first
sheltered
by
the
steep
banks
of
the
creek
the
second
halfway
up
the
bluff
covered
by
a
breastwork
the
third
on
the
crest
occupying
a
line
of
and
the
riflemen
were
supported
by
a
dozen
batteries
of
rifled
guns
the
remainder
of
the
guns
were
in
reserve
but
lee
had
few
misgivings
in
one
respect
the
federal
position
seemed
radically
defective
the
line
of
retreat
on
white
house
was
exposed
to
attack
from
old
cold
harbour
in
fact
with
old
cold
harbour
in
possession
of
the
confederates
retreat
could
only
be
effected
by
one
road
north
of
the
chickahominy
that
by
parker
mill
and
dispatch
station
and
if
this
road
were
threatened
porter
in
order
to
cover
it
would
be
compelled
to
bring
over
troops
from
his
left
and
centre
or
to
prolong
his
line
until
it
was
weak
everywhere
there
was
no
great
reason
to
fear
that
mcclellan
would
send
porter
heavy
reinforcements
to
do
so
he
would
have
to
draw
troops
from
his
intrenchments
on
the
south
bank
of
the
chickahominy
and
magruder
had
been
instructed
to
maintain
a
brisk
demonstration
against
this
portion
of
the
line
it
was
probable
that
the
federal
commander
with
his
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
numbers
opposed
to
him
would
be
induced
by
this
means
to
anticipate
a
general
attack
against
his
whole
front
and
would
postpone
moving
his
reserves
until
it
was
too
late
while
hill
was
skirmishing
with
the
federals
lee
was
anxiously
awaiting
intelligence
of
jackson
arrival
at
old
cold
harbour
longstreet
was
already
forming
up
for
battle
and
at
regiments
were
slipped
to
the
attack
a
fierce
and
sanguinary
conflict
now
ensued
emerging
in
lines
from
the
cover
of
the
woods
the
confederates
swept
down
the
open
slopes
floundering
in
the
swamps
and
struggling
through
the
abattis
which
had
been
placed
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
they
drove
in
the
advanced
line
of
hostile
riflemen
and
strove
gallantly
to
ascend
the
slope
which
lay
beyond
but
brigade
after
brigade
says
general
porter
seemed
almost
to
melt
away
before
the
concentrated
fire
of
our
artillery
and
infantry
yet
others
pressed
on
followed
by
supports
daring
and
brave
as
their
predecessors
despite
their
heavy
losses
and
the
disheartening
effect
of
having
to
clamber
over
many
of
their
disabled
and
dead
and
to
meet
their
surviving
comrades
rushing

great
disorder

did
not

till
half

but
when
he
advanced
there
came
no
response
from
the
left
a
battery
of
hill
division
was
brought
into
action
but
was
soon
silenced
and
beyond
this
insignificant
demonstration
the
army
of
the
valley
made
no
endeavour
to
join
the
battle
the
brigades
were
halted
by
the
roadside
away
to
the
right
above
the
intervening
forest
rolled
the
roar
of
battle
the
crash
of
shells
and
the
din
of
musketry
but
no
orders
were
given
for
the
advance
nor
had
jackson
arrival
produced
the
slightest
consternation
in
the
federal
ranks
although
from
his
position
at
cold
harbour
he
seriously
threatened
their
line
of
retreat
to
the
white
house
they
had
neither
denuded
their
left
nor
brought
up
their
reserves
where
he
was
now
established
he
was
actually
nearer
white
house
than
any
portion
of
porter
army
corps
and
yet
that
general
apparently
accepted
the
situation
with
equanimity
lee
had
anticipated
that
jackson
approach
would
cause
the
enemy
to
prolong
their
front
in
order
to
cover
their
line
of
retreat
to
the
white
house
and
so
weaken
that
part
of
the
position
which
was
to
be
attacked
by
longstreet
and
jackson
had
been
to
draw
up
his
troops
so
as
to
meet
such
a
contingency
this
order
was
verbal
no
record
of
it
is
to
be
found
and
jackson
never
mentioned
either
at
the
time
or
afterwards
what
its
purport
was
his
surviving
staff
officers
however
are
unanimous
in
declaring
that
he
must
have
received
direct
instructions
from
general
lee
is
it
possible
writes
mcguire
that
jackson
who
knew
nothing
of
the
country
and
little
of
the
exact
situation
of
affairs
would
have
taken
the
responsibility
of
stopping
at
old
cold
harbour
for
an
hour
or
more
unless
he
had
had
the
authority
of
general
lee
to
do
so
i
saw
him
that
morning
talking
to
general
lee
general
lee
was
sitting
on
a
log
and
jackson
standing
up
general
lee
was
evidently
giving
him
instructions
for
the
day
in
his
report
volume
part
page
lee
says
the
arrival
of
jackson
on
our
left
was
momentarily
expected
it
was
supposed
that
his
approach
would
cause
the
extension
in
that
direction
hoping
he
says
in
his
report
that
generals
hill
and
longstreet
would
soon
drive
the
federals
towards
me
i
directed
general
hill
to
move
his
division
to
the
left
of
the
wood
so
as
to
leave
between
him
and
the
wood
on
the
right
an
open
space
across
which
i
hoped
that
the
enemy
would
be
driven
but
lee
was
deceived
the
federal
line
of
retreat
ran
not
to
the
white
house
but
over
grapevine
bridge
mcclellan
had
for
some
time
foreseen
that
he
might
be
compelled
to
abandon
the
york
river
railway
and
directly
he
suspected
that
jackson
was
marching
to
richmond
had
begun
to
transfer
his
line
of
operations
from
the
york
to
the
james
and
his
base
of
supply
from
the
white
house
to
harrison
landing
so
vast
is
the
amount
of
stores
necessary
for
the
subsistence
health
and
armament
of
a
host
like
mcclellan
that
a
change
of
base
is
an
operation
which
can
only
be
effected
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
the
army
of
the
potomac
numbered
men
and
animals
tons
of
ammunition
food
forage
medical
and
other
supplies
had
to
be
forwarded
each
day
from
white
house
to
the
front
and
at
one
time
during
the
operations
from
fifty
to
sixty
days
rations
for
the
entire
army
amounting
probably
to
tons
were
accumulated
at
the
depot
tons
daily
per
men
is
a
fair
estimate
for
an
army
operating
in
a
barren
country
it
is
evident
then
that
the
possibility
of
the
enemy
shifting
his
line
of
operations
to
the
james
abandoning
the
york
river
railroad
might
easily
have
escaped
the
penetration
of
either
lee
or
jackson
they
were
not
behind
the
scenes
of
the
federal
administrative
system
they
were
not
aware
of
the
money
labour
and
ingenuity
which
had
been
lavished
on
the
business
of
supply
they
had
not
seen
with
their
own
eyes
the
fleet
of
four
hundred
transports
which
covered
the
reaches
of
the
york
they
had
not
yet
realised
the
enormous
advantage
which
an
army
derives
from
the
command
of
the
sea
nor
were
they
enlightened
by
the
calmness
with
which
their
immediate
adversaries
on
the
field
of
battle
regarded
jackson
possession
of
old
cold
harbour
still
one
fact
was
manifest
the
federals
showed
no
disposition
whatever
to
weaken
or
change
their
position
and
it
was
clear
that
the
success
was
not
to
be
attained
by
mere
manoeuvre
lee
seeing
hill
division
roughly
handled
ordered
longstreet
forward
while
jackson
judging
from
the
sound
and
direction
of
the
firing
that
the
original
plan
had
failed
struck
in
with
vigour
opposed
to
him
was
sykes
division
of
regulars
supported
by
eighteen
guns
afterwards
increased
to
and
in
the
men
of
the
united
states
army
the
valley
soldiers
met
a
stubborn
foe
the
position
moreover
occupied
by
sykes
possessed
every
advantage
which
a
defender
could
desire
manned
even
by
troops
of
inferior
mettle
it
might
well
have
proved
impregnable
the
valley
was
wider
than
further
west
and
a
thousand
yards
intervened
between
the
opposing
ridges
from
either
crest
the
cornfields
sloped
gently
to
the
marshy
sources
of
the
creek
hidden
by
tall
timber
and
dense
undergrowth
the
right
and
rear
of
the
position
were
protected
by
a
second
stream
running
south
to
the
chickahominy
and
winding
through
a
swamp
which
stuart
posted
on
jackson
left
pronounced
impassable
for
horsemen
between
the
head
waters
of
these
two
streams
rose
the
spur
on
which
stands
mcgehee
house
facing
the
road
from
old
cold
harbour
and
completely
commanding
the
country
to
the
north
and
the
flank
therefore
was
well
secured
the
front
was
strong
with
a
wide
field
of
fire
the
confederate
artillery
even
if
it
could
make
its
way
through
the
thick
woods
on
the
opposite
crest
would
have
to
unlimber
under
fire
at
effective
range
and
the
marsh
below
with
its
tangled
undergrowth
and
abattis
could
hardly
fail
to
throw
the
attacking
infantry
into
disorder
along
the
whole
of
sykes
line
only
two
weak
points
were
apparent
on
his
left
as
already
described
a
broad
tract
of
woodland
covering
nearly
the
whole

down

under

it
was
possible
that
the
confederate
infantry
might
mass
for
the
assault
but
once
in
the
open
unaided
by
artillery
their
further
progress
would
be
difficult
under
ordinary
circumstances
a
thorough
reconnaissance
followed
by
a
carefully
planned
attack
would
have
been
the
natural
course
of
the
assailant
the
very
strength
of
the
position
was
in
favour
of
the
confederates
the
creek
which
covered
the
whole
front
rendered
a
counterstroke
impracticable
and
facilitated
a
flank
attack
holding
the
right
bank
of
the
creek
with
a
portion
of
his
force
jackson
might
have
thrown
the
remainder
against
hill
and
working
round
the
flank
have
repeated
the
tactics
of
kernstown
winchester
and
port
republic
but
the
situation
permitted
no
delay
hill
was
hard
pressed
the
sun
was
already
sinking
mcclellan
reserves
might
be
coming
up
and
if
the
battle
was
to
be
won
it
must
be
won
by
direct
attack
there
was
no
time
for

descended
to

occupied
by
his
skirmishers
in

the
marshy
thickets
where
the
federal
shells
were
bursting

the
confusion
became
great

lost
their

their

one
point
the

was
so
densely
crowded
that

were
forced
to
the

there
were
wide
intervals
and

became
impossible

hundred

rolled
heavily
through

centre
where
the
fight
was
hottest
the
impetuosity
of
both
officers
and
men
carried
them
forward
up
the

an
attempt
to
deliver
a
charge
with
the
whole

failed
in
combination
and
such
portion
of
the

scourged
by

fell
back
before
the
fire
of
the
unshaken
federals

the
wood
to
the
right

met
with
even
fiercer
opposition
so
hastily
had
the
confederate
line
been
formed
and
so
difficult
was
it
for
the
brigades
to
maintain
touch
and
direction
in
the
thick
covert
that
gaps
soon
opened
along
the
front
and
of
these
gaps
directly
the
southerners
gained
the
edge
of

the
northern

took
quick
advantage

ground
the

the
young

officer
to
whom
these
instructions
were
entrusted
misunderstanding
the
intentions
of
his
chief
communicated
the
message
to
the
brigadiers
with
the
addition
that
they
were
to
await
further
orders
before
engaging
the
enemy
partly
for
this
reason
and
partly
because
the
rear
regiments
of
his
division
had
lost
touch
with
the
leading
brigades
ewell
was
left
without
assistance
for
some
time
the
error
was
undiscovered
jackson
grew
anxious
from
his
station
near
old
cold
harbour
little
could
be
seen
of
the
confederate
troops
on
the
ridge
beyond
the

the
dark
lines
of
the
infantry
were
visible
amongst
the

in

immediately
beneath

as
well
as
in
the
forest
to
the
right
front
the
dense
smoke
and
the
denser
timber
hid
the
progress
of
the
fight
yet
the
sustained
fire
was
a
sure
token
that
the
enemy
still
held
his
own
and
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
his
staff
beheld
their
leader
riding
restlessly
to
and
fro
and
heard
his
orders
given
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
the
storm
within
it
may
be
noted
that
jackson
command
had
now
been
increased
by
two
divisions
whiting
and
hill
but
there
had
been
no
increase
in
the
very
small
staff
which
had
sufficed
for
the
valley
army
the
mistakes
which
occurred
at
mill
and
jackson
ignorance
of
the
movements
and
progress
of
his
troops
were
in
great
part
due
to
his
lack
of
staff
officers
a
most
important
message
writes
dabney
involving
tactical
knowledge
was
carried
by
a
unconscious
says
dabney
that
his
veteran
brigades
were
but
now
reaching
the
ridge
of
battle
he
supposed
that
all
his
strength
had
been
put
forth
and
what
had
never
happened

was
not
crushed

development
of

attack
noted
the
small
number
of
his
batteries
the
long
delay
in
the
advance
of
the
supports
the
narrow
front
of
his
line
of
battle
he
would
have
discovered
that
the
confederate
strength
had
been
greatly
exaggerated
there
were
moments
too
during
the
fight
when
a
strong
counterstroke
made
by
fresh
troops
would
have
placed
lee
army
in
the
greatest
peril
but
a
general
who
thinks
only
of
holding
his
lines
and
not
of
annihilating
the
enemy
is
a
poor
tactician
and
mcclellan
lack
of
enterprise
which
lee
had
so
accurately
gauged
may
be
inferred
from
his
telegram
to
lincoln
i
have
lost
this
battle
because
my

is
too
small
report
of

on
the
conduct
of
the

porter
was
perhaps
a
more
than
sufficient
substitute
for
the
his
tactics
as
fighting
a
waiting
battle
had
been
admirable
and
when
his
front
was
broken
strongly
and
with
cool
judgment
he
sought
to
hold
back
the
enemy
and
cover
the
bridges
the
line
of
batteries
he
established
across
the
plateau
guns
in
all
proved
at
first
an
effective
barrier
but
the
retreat
of
the
infantry
the
waning
light
and
the
general
dissolution
of
all
order
had
its
effect
upon
the
gunners
when
the
remnant
of
the
cavalry
was
borne
back
in
flight
the
greater
part
of
the
batteries
had
already
limbered
up
and
over
the
bare
surface
of
the
upland
the
confederate
infantry
shooting
down
the
terrified
teams
rushed
forward
in
hot
pursuit
guns
with
a
large
number
of
ammunition
waggons
were
captured
on
the
field
prisoners
surrendered
at
every
step
and
the
fight
surged
onward
towards
the
bridges
but
between
the
bridges
and
the
battlefield
on
the
slopes
falling
to
the
chickahominy
the
dark
forest
covered
the
retreat
of
the
routed
army
night
had
already
fallen
the
confusion
in
the
ranks
of
the
confederates
was
extreme
and
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
all
direction
had
been
lost
none
knew
the
bearings
of
the
bridges
or
whether
the
federals
were
retreating
east
or
south
regiments
had
already
been
exposed
to
the
fire
of
their
comrades
and
in
front
of
the
forest
a
perceptible
hesitation
seized
on
both
officers
and
men
at
this
moment
in
front
of
hill
division
which
was
advancing
by
the
road
leading
directly
to
the
bridges
loud
cheers
were
heard
it
was
clear
that
federal
reinforcements
had
arrived
the
general
ordered
his
troops
to
halt
and
along
the
whole
line
the
forward
movement
came
quickly
to
a
standstill
two
brigades
french
and
meagher
tardily
sent
over
by
mcclellan
had
arrived
in
time
to
stave
off
a
terrible
disaster
pushing
through
the
mass
of
fugitives
with
the
bayonet
these
fine
troops
had
crossed
the
bridge
passed
through
the
woods
and
formed
line
on
the
southern
crest
of
the
plateau
joining
the
regulars
who
still
presented
a
stubborn
front
they
opened
a
heavy
fire
and
under
cover
of
their
steadfast
lines
porter
troops
withdrew
across
the
river
notwithstanding
this
strong
reinforcement
of
or
fresh
troops
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
had
the
confederates
pushed
resolutely
forward
that
the
victory
would
have
been
far
more
complete
winder
says
general
hill
thought
that
we
ought
to
pursue
into
the
woods
on
the
right
of
the
grapevine
bridge
road
but
not
knowing
the
position
of
our
friends
nor
what
federal
reserves
might
be
awaiting
us
in
the
woods
i
thought
it
advisable
not
to
move
on
general
lawton
concurred
with
me
i
had
no
artillery
to
shell
the
woods
in
front
as
mine
had
not
got
through
the
swamp
winder
he
adds
was
right
even
a
show
of
pressure
must
have
been
attended
with
great
result
battles
and
leaders
volume
page
had
jackson
been
at
hand
the
pressure
would
in
all
probability
have
been
applied
the
contagion
of
defeat
soon
spreads
and
whatever
reserves
a
flying
enemy
may
possess
if
they
are
vigorously
attacked
whilst
the
fugitives
are
still
passing
through
their
ranks
history
tells
us
however
bold
their
front
that
unless
they
are
intrenched
their
resistance
is
seldom
long
protracted
more
than
all
when
night
has
fallen
on
the
field
and
prevents
all
estimate
of
the
strength
of
the
attack
a
resolute
advance
has
peculiar
chances
of
success
but
when
his
advanced
line
halted
jackson
was
not
yet
up
and
before
he
arrived
the
impetus
of
victory
had
died
away
the
federal
reserves
were
deployed
in
a
strong
position
and
the
opportunity
had
already
passed
it
is
no
time
when
the
tide
of
victory
bears
him
forward
for
a
general
to
take
counsel
of
his
fears
it
is
no
time
to
count
numbers
or
to
conjure
up
the
phantoms
of
possible
reserves
the
sea
itself
is
not
more
irresistible
than
an
army
which
has
stormed
a
strong
position
and
which
has
attained
in
so
doing
the
exhilarating
consciousness
of
superior
courage
had
stuart
with
his
horsemen
followed
up
the
pursuit
towards
the
bridges
the
federal
reserves
might
have
been
swept
away
in
panic
but
stuart
in
common
with
lee
and
jackson
expected
that
the
enemy
would
endeavour
to
reach
the
white
house
and
when
he
saw
that
their
lines
were
breaking
he
had
dashed
down
a
lane
which
led
to
the
river
road
about
three
miles
distant
when
he
reached
that
point
darkness
had
already
fallen
and
finding
no
traces
of
the
enemy
he
had
returned
to
old
cold
harbour
on
the
night
of
the
battle
the
confederates
remained
where
the
issue
of
the
fight
had
found
them
across
the
grapevine
road
the
pickets
of
the
hostile
forces
were
in
close
proximity
and
men
of
both
sides
in
search
of
water
or
carrying
messages
strayed
within
the
lines
jackson
himself
it
is
said
came
near
capture
riding
forward
in
the
darkness
attended
by
only
a
few
staff
officers
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
presence
of
a
federal
picket
judging
rightly
of
the
enemy
morale
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
charging
into
the
midst
ordered
them
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
fifteen
or
twenty
prisoners
marching
to
the
rear
amused
the
troops
they
met
on
the
march
by
loudly
proclaiming
that
they
had
the
honour
of
being
captured
by
stonewall
jackson
these
men
were
not
without
companions
federals
were
reported
either
captured
or
missing
and
while
some
of
those
were
probably
among
the
dead
a
large
proportion
found
their
way
to
richmond

the

although
the

suffered

than

inflicted
was
a
long
step
towards
accomplishing
the

at
the

of
his
whole
army
and
his
communications
with
the
white
house
and
the
pamunkey
were
at
the
mercy
of
his
enemies
still
the
confederate
outlook
was
not
altogether
clear
it
is
one
thing
to
win
a
victory
but
another
to
make
such
use
of
it
as
to
annihilate
the
enemy
porter
defeat
was
but
a
beginning
of
operations
and
although
lee
was
convinced
that
mcclellan
would
retreat
he
was
by
no
means
so
certain
that
his
escape
could
be
prevented
yet
this
was
essential
if
the
federal
army
were
suffered
to
fall
back
without
incurring
further
loss
it
would
be
rapidly
reinforced
from
washington
and
resuming
the
advance
this
time
with
still
larger
numbers
might
render
mill
a
barren
victory
how
to
compass
the
destruction
of
host
was
the
problem
that
now
confronted
the
confederate
leader
and
before
a
plan
could
be
devised
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
the
direction
of
the
retreat
on
the
morning
of
june
it
was
found
that
no
formed
body
of
federal
troops
remained
north
of
the
chickahominy
french
meagher
and
sykes
the
regulars
forming
the
had
fallen
back
during
the
night
and
destroyed
the
bridges
hundreds
of
stragglers
were
picked
up
and
one
of
the
most
gallant
of
the
northern
general
reynolds
was
found
asleep
in
the
woods
unaware
that
his
troops
had
crossed
the
stream
no
further
fighting
was
to
be
expected
on
the
plateau
but
it
was
possible
that
the
enemy
might
still
endeavour
to
preserve
his
communications
marching
by
the
south
bank
of
the
river
and
recrossing
by
the
railway
and
bottom
bridges
stuart
supported
by
ewell
was
at
once
ordered
to
seize
the
former
but
when
the
cavalry
reached
dispatch
station
a
small
federal
detachment
retreated
to
the
south
bank
of
the
chickahominy
and
fired
the
timbers
meanwhile
from
the
field
of
gaines
mill
long
columns
of
dust
rising
above
the
forests
to
the
south
had
been
descried
showing
that
the
enemy
was
in
motion
and
when
the
news
came
in
that
the
railway
bridge
had
been
destroyed
and
that
the
line
itself
was
unprotected
it
was
at
once
evident
that
mcclellan
had
abandoned
his
communications
with
white
house
this
was
valuable
information
but
still
the
line
of
retreat
had
not
yet
been
ascertained
the
federals
might
retreat
to
some
point
on
the
james
river
due
south
there
meeting
their
transports
or
they
might
march
down
the
peninsula
to
yorktown
and
fortress
monroe
in
the
latter
event
says
lee
it
was
necessary
that
our
troops
should
continue
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
and
until
the
intention
of
general
mcclellan
was
discovered
it
was
deemed
injudicious
to
change
their
disposition
ewell
was
therefore
ordered
to
proceed
to
bridge
and
the
cavalry
to
watch
the
bridges
below
no
certain
indications
of
a
retreat
to
the
james
river
were
discovered
by
our
forces
magruder
on
the
south
side
of
the
chickahominy
and
late
in
the
afternoon
the
enemy
works
were
reported
to
be
fully
manned
below
south
of
the
enemy
works
the
country
was
densely
wooded
and
intersected
by
impassable
swamps
at
once
concealing
his
movements
and
precluding
reconnaissances
except
by
the
regular
roads
all
of
which
were
strongly
guarded
the
bridges
over
the
chickahominy
in
rear
of
the
enemy
were
destroyed
and
their
reconstruction
impracticable
in
the
presence
of
his
whole
army
and
powerful
batteries
we
were
therefore
compelled
to
wait
until
his
purpose
should
be
developed
lee

volume
part
pages
and
during
the
day
therefore
the
confederate
army
remained
on
the
waiting
for
the
game
to
bolt
in
the
evening
however
signs
of
a
general
movement
were
reported
in
rear
of
the
intrenchments
at
seven
pines
and
as
nothing
had
been
observed
by
the
cavalry
on
the
chickahominy
lee
rightly
concluding
that
mcclellan
was
retreating
to
the
james
issued
orders
for
the
pursuit
to
be
taken
up
the
next
morning
but
to
intercept
the
enemy
before
he
could
fortify
a
position
covered
by
the
fire
of
his
gunboats
on
the
banks
of
the
james
was
a
difficult
operation
the
situation
demanded
rapid
marching
close
concert
and
delicate
manoeuvres
the
confederate
army
was
in
rear
of
the
federals
and
separated
from
them
by
the
chickahominy
and
to
reach
the
james
mcclellan
had
only
fourteen
miles
to
cover
but
the
country
over
which
he
had
to
pass
was
still
more
intricate
and
traversed
by
even
fewer
roads
than
the
district
which
had
hitherto
been
the
theatre
of
operations
across
his
line
of
march
ran
the
white
oak
swamp
bordered
by
thick
woods
and
a
wide
morass
and
crossed
by
only
one
bridge
if
he
could
transfer
his
whole
army
south
of
this
stream
without
molestation
he
would
find
himself
within
six
miles
of
his
gunboats
and
as
his
left
flank
was
already
resting
on
the
swamp
it
was
not
easy
for
lee
army
to
prevent
his
passage
but
confederates
were
already
south
of
the
chickahominy
on
the
flank
of
mcclellan
line
of
march
and
it
was
certainly
possible
that
this
force
might
detain
the
federals
until
hill
longstreet
and
jackson
should
come
up
magruder
and
huger
were
therefore
ordered
to
advance
early
on
the
and
moving

by
the
williamsburg
the
other
by
the
charles
city
road
to
strike

recrossing
the
chickahominy
at
new

to
march
by
the
darbytown
road
in
the
direction
of
charles
city
cross
roads
thus
turning
the
head
waters
of
the
white
oak
swamp
and
threatening
the
federal
rear
jackson
crossing

was
to
move
down
the
south
bank
of
the
chickahominy
cross
the
swamp
by
the
bridge
and
force
his
way
to
the
long
bridge
road
the
confederate
army
was
thus
divided
into
four
columns
moving
by
four
different
roads
each
column
at
starting
was
several
miles
distant
from
the
others
and
a
junction
was
to
be
made
upon
the
field
of
battle
the
cavalry
moreover
with
the
exception
of
a
few
squadrons
was
far
away
upon
the
left
pursuing
a
large
detachment
which
had
been
observed
on
the
road
to
the
white

this
detachment
about

of
the
outposts
that
had
been
established
north
and
of

on
june
of
the
garrison
of
the
white
house
and
of
troops
recently
disembarked
mcclellan
had
undoubtedly
resolved
on
a
most
hazardous
manoeuvre
his
supply
and
ammunition
train
consisted
of
over
five
thousand
waggons
he
was
encumbered
with
the
heavy
guns
of
the
siege
artillery
he
had
with
him
more
than
fifty
field
batteries
his
army
was
still
strong
and
this
unwieldy
multitude
of
men
horses
and
vehicles
had
to
be
passed
over
white
oak
swamp
and
then
to
continue
its
march
across
the
front
of
a
powerful
and
determined
enemy
but
lee
also
was
embarrassed
by
the
nature
of
the
country
strange
to
say
while
the
confederates
possessed
no
maps
whatever
mcclellan
was
well
supplied
in
this
respect
two
or
three
weeks
before

officers

the

back
destroying

longstreet
with

moved
forward

found
a
federal
division
in
position
near
glendale
bringing
his
artillery
into
action
he
held
his
infantry
in
hand
until
huger
should
come
up
on

jackson

be
heard
at
white

holmes
followed
by
magruder
was
marching
up
the
newmarket

to

and
when
the
sound
of
jackson
artillery
became
audible
to
the
northwards
lee
sent
longstreet
forward
to
the
attack
a
sanguinary
conflict
on
ground
covered
with
heavy
timber
and
cut
up
by
deep
ravines
resulted
in
the
federals
holding
their
ground
till
nightfall
and
although
many
prisoners
and
several
batteries
were
captured
by
the
confederates
mcclellan
under
cover
of
the
darkness
made
good
his

map
of
the
seven
days
june
to

the
battle
of
glendale
or
frayser
farm
was
the
crisis
of
the
seven
days
had
lee
been
able
to
concentrate
his
whole
strength
against
the
federals
it
is
probable
that
mcclellan
would
never
have
reached
the
james
but
longstreet
and
hill
fought
unsupported
as
the
former
very
justly
complained
men
were
within

of
the

none
came
to

by

on
the
charles
city
road
was
obstructed
by
felled
trees
when
he
at
last
arrived
in
front
of
the
enemy
he
was
held
in
check
by
two
batteries
and
he
does
not
appear
to
have
opened
communication
with
either
lee
or
longstreet
magruder

been
ordered
to
march
down
from

there

he
was
ordered
to
move
to

this
order
was
soon
countermanded
but
he
was
unable
to
join
longstreet
until
the

was
over

was
held
in
check
by

still
north
of

from

destructive
but
useless
raid
on
the

at
the
white

nor
had
the
conduct
of
the
battle
been
unaffected
by
the
complicated
nature
of
the
general
plan
longstreet
attacked
alone
hill
being
held
back
in
order
to
be
fresh
for
the
pursuit
when
jackson
and
huger
should
strike
in
the
attack
was
successful
and
mccall
division
which
had
shared
the
defeat
at
gaines
mill
was
driven
from
its
position
but
mccall
was
reinforced
by
other
divisions
longstreet
was
thrown
on
to
the
defensive
by
superior
numbers
and
when
hill
was
at
length
put
in
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
fierce
counterblows
of
the
federals
were
beaten
off
jackson
had
been
unable
to
participate
in
the
conflict
when
night
fell
he
was
still
north
of
the
white
oak
swamp
seven
miles
distant
from
his
morning
bivouac
and
hardly
a
single
infantry
man
in
his
command
had
pulled
a
trigger
according
to
his
own
report
his
troops
reached
white
oak
bridge
about
noon
here
the
enemy
made
a
determined
effort
to
retard
our
advance
and
thereby
to
prevent
an
immediate
junction
between
general
longstreet
and
myself
we
found
the
bridge
destroyed
the
ordinary
place
of
crossing
commanded
by
their
batteries
on
the
other
side
and
all
approach
to
it
barred
by
detachments
of
concealed
in
a
dense
wood
close
by
a
heavy
cannonading
in
front
announced
the
engagement
of
general
longstreet
at
frayser
farm
glendale
and
made
me
eager
to
press
forward
but
the
marshy
character
of
the
soil
the
destruction
of
the
bridge
over
the
marsh
and
creek
and
the
strong
position
of
the
enemy
for
defending
the
passage
prevented
my
advancing
until
the
following
morning
volume
part
pages
such
are
jackson
reasons
for
his
failure
to
with
longstreet
it
is
clear
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
part
he
was
expected
to
play
and
he
used
every
means
which
suggested
itself
as
practicable
to
force
a
crossing
the
virginia
cavalry
under
colonel
munford
had
now
joined
him
from
the
valley
and
their
commanding
officer
bears
witness
that
jackson
showed
no
lack
of
energy
when
i
left
the
general
on
the
preceding
evening
he
ordered
me
to
be
at
the
five
miles
from
white
oak
bridge
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
ready
to
move
in
advance
of
his
troops
the
worst
thunderstorm
came
up
about
night
i
ever
was
in
and
in
that
thickly
wooded
country
one
could
not
see
his
horse
ears
my
command
scattered
in
the
storm
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
officer
had
a
rougher
time
in
any
one
night
than
i
had
to
endure
when
the
first
grey
dawn
appeared
i
started
off
my
adjutant
and
officers
to
bring
up
the
scattered
regiment
but
at
sunrise
i
had
not
more
than
fifty
men
and
i
was
half
a
mile
from
the
when
i
arrived
to
my
horror
there
sat
jackson
waiting
for
me
he
was
in
a
bad
humour
and
said
colonel
my
orders
to
you
were
to
be
here
at
sunrise
i
explained
my
situation
telling
him
that
we
had
no
provisions
and
that
the
storm
and
the
dark
night
had
conspired
against
me
when
i
got
through
he
replied
yes
sir
but
colonel
i
ordered
you
to
be
here
at
sunrise
move
on
with
your
regiment
if
you
meet
the
enemy
drive
in
his
pickets
and
if
you
want
artillery
colonel
crutchfield
will
furnish
you
i
started
on
with
my
little
handful
of
men
as
others
came
straggling
on
to
join
me
jackson
noticed
it
and
sent
two
couriers
to
inform
me
that
my
men
were
straggling
badly
i
rode
back
and
went
over
the
same
story
hoping
that
he
would
be
impressed
with
my
difficulties
he
listened
to
me
but
replied
as
before
yes
sir
but
i
ordered
you
to
be
here
at
sunrise
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
seeing
that
he
was
in
a
peculiar
mood
i
determined
to
make
the
best
of
my
trouble
sent
my
adjutant
back
and
made
him
halt
the
stragglers
and
form
my
men
as
they
came
up
and
with
what
i
had
determined
to
give
him
no
cause
for
complaint
when
we
came
upon
the
enemy
picket
we
charged
and
pushed
the
picket
every
step
of
the
way
into
their
camp
where
there
were
a
large
number
of
wounded
and
many
stores
it
was
done
so
rapidly
that
the
enemy
battery
on
the
other
side
of
white
oak
swamp
could
not
fire
on
us
without
endangering
their
own
friends
when
jackson
came
up
he
was
smiling
and
he
at
once
shortly
after
noon
ordered
colonel
crutchfield
to
bring
up
the
artillery
and
very
soon
the
batteries
were
at
work
after
the
lapse
of
about
an
hour
my
regiment
had
assembled
and
while
our
batteries
were
shelling
those
of
the
enemy
jackson
sent
for
me
and
said
colonel
move
your
regiment
over
the
creek
and
secure
those
guns
i
will
ride
with
you
to
the
swamp
when
we
reached
the
crossing
we
found
that
the
enemy
had
torn
up
the
bridge
and
had
thrown
the
timbers
into
the
stream
forming
a
tangled
mass
which
seemed
to
prohibit
a
crossing
i
said
to
general
jackson
that
i
did
not
think
that
we
could
cross
he
looked
at
me
waved
his
hand
and
replied
yes
colonel
try
it
in
we
went
and
floundered
over
and
before
i
formed
the
men
jackson
cried
out
to
me
to
move
on
at
the
guns
colonel
breckenridge
started
out
with
what
we
had
over
and
i
soon
got
over
the
second
squadron
and
moved
up
the
hill
we
reached
the
guns
but
they
had
an
infantry
support
which
gave
us
a
volley
at
the
same
time
a
battery
on
our
right
which
we
had
not
seen
opened
on
us
and
back
we
had
to
come
i
moved
down
the
swamp
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
with
great
difficulty
by
a
jackson
himself
writes
mcguire
accompanied
by
three
or
four
members
of
his
staff
of
whom
i
was
one
followed
the
cavalry
across
the
swamp
the
ford
was
miry
and
deep
and
impracticable
for
either
artillery
or
infantry
the
artillery
did
little
better
than
the
cavalry
the
ground
on
the
north
bank
of
the
swamp
by
no
means
favoured
the
action
of
the
guns
to
the
right
of
the
road
the
slopes
were
clear
and
unobstructed
hut
the
crest
was
within
the
forest
while
to
the
left
a
thick
pine
wood
covered
both
ridge
and
valley
on
the
bank
held
by
the
federals
the
ground
was
open
ascending
gently
to
the
ridge
but
the
edge
of
the
stream
immediately
opposite
the
cleared
ground
on
the
confederate
right
was
covered
by
a
belt
of
tall
trees
in
full
leaf
which
made
observation
by
either
side
a
matter
of
much
difficulty
this
belt
was
full
of
infantry
while
to
the
right
rear
commanding
the
ruined
bridge
stood
the
batteries
which
had
driven
back
the
cavalry
after
some
time
spent
in
reconnaissance
it
was
determined
to
cut
a
track
through
the
wood
to
the
right
of
the
road
this
was
done
and
guns
moving
forward
simultaneously
opened
fire
on
the
position
the
surprise
was
complete
one
of
the
federal
batteries
dispersed
in
confusion
the
other
disappeared
and
the
infantry
supports
fell
back
jackson
immediately
ordered
two
guns
to
advance
down
the
road
and
shell
the
belt
of
trees
which
harboured
the
enemy
skirmishers
these
were
driven
back
the
divisions
of
hill
and
whiting
were
formed
up
in
the
pine
wood
on
the
left
and
a
working
party
was
sent
forward
to
repair
the
bridge
suddenly
from
the
high
ground
behind
the
belt
of
trees
by
which
they
were
completely
screened
two
fresh
federal
batteries
afterwards
increased
to
three
opened
on
the
line
of
confederate
guns
under
cover
of
this
fire
their
skirmishers
returned
to
the
swamp
and
their
main
line
came
forward
to
a
position
whence
it
commanded
the
crossing
at
effective
range
the
two
guns
on
the
road
were
sent
to
the
the
shells
of
the
federal
batteries
fell
into
the
stream
and
the
men
who
had
been
labouring
at
the
bridge
ran
back
and
refused
to
work
the
artillery
duel
in
which
neither
side
could
see
the
other
but
in
which
both
suffered
some
loss
continued
throughout
the
afternoon
meantime
a
confederate
regiment
fording
the
stream
drove
in
the
hostile
skirmishers
and
seized
the
belt
of
trees
wright
brigade
of
huger
division
which
had
joined
jackson
as
the
guns
came
into
action
was
sent
back
to
force
a
passage
at
brackett
ford
a
mile
up
stream
and
reconnaissances
were
pushed
out
to
find
some
way
of
turning
the
enemy
position
every
road
and
track
however
was
obstructed
by
felled
trees
and
abattis
and
it
was
found
that
a
passage
was
impracticable
at
brackett
ford
two
companies
were
pushed
over
the
creek
and
drove
back
the
enemy
pickets
i
discovered
says
wright
that
the
enemy
had
destroyed
the
bridge
and
had
completely
blockaded
the
road
through
the
swamp
by
felling
trees
in
and
across
it
i
ascertained
that
the
road
debouched
from
the
swamp
into
an
open
field
meadow
commanded
by
a
line
of
high
hills
all
in
cultivation
and
free
from
timber
upon
this
ridge
of
hills
the
enemy
had
posted
heavy
batteries
of
strongly
supported
by
infantry
which
swept
the
meadow
by
a
direct
and
cross
fire
and
which
could
be
used
with
terrible
effect
upon
my
column
while
struggling
through
the
fallen
timber
in
the
wood
through
the
swamp
volume
part
pages
having
ascertained
that
the
enemy
was
present
in
great
strength
on
the
further
bank
that
every
road
was
obstructed
and
that
there
was
no
means
of
carrying
his
artillery
over
the
creek
or
favourable
ground
on
which
his
infantry
could
act
jackson
gave
up
all
hope
of
aiding
longstreet
that
the
obstacles
which
confronted
him
were
serious
there
can
be
no
question
his
guns
although
superior
in
number
were
unable
to
beat
down
the
fire
of
the
rifled
batteries
the
masses
were
well
hidden
the
roads
were
blocked
the
stream
was
swollen
the
banks
marshy
and
although
infantry
could
cross
them
the
fords
which
had
proved
difficult
for
the
cavalry
would
have
stopped
the
artillery
the
ammunition
waggons
and
the
ambulances
while
the
federal
position
on
the
crest
of
a
long
open
slope
was
exceedingly
strong
jackson
as
his
report
shows
maturely
weighed
these
difficulties
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
could
do
no
good
by
sending
over
his
infantry
alone
it
was
essential
it
is
true
to
detain
as
many
as
possible
of
the
enemy
on
the
banks
of
the
swamp
while
longstreet
hill
huger
and
magruder
dealt
with
the
remainder
and
this
he
fully
realised
but
it
is
by
no
means
improbable
that
he
considered
the
heavy
fire
of
his
guns
and
the
threatening
position
of
his
infantry
would
have
this
effect
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
far
this
hope
supposing
that
he
entertained
it
was
fulfilled
two
divisions
of
federal
infantry
and
three
batteries
a
total
of
men
defended
the
passage
at
white
oak
bridge
against
confederates
including
wright
and
a
detached
force
of
infantry
and

was
posted
at

when
it
was
found
that
this

was
not
followed
up
by
an
infantry
attack
these
brigades
with
two
others
in
addition
were
sent
over
to
reinforce
the
troops
which
were
engaged
with
longstreet

these
facts
became
known
when
it
was
clear
that
had
jackson
attacked
vigorously
the
federals
would
hardly
have
dared
to
weaken
their
line
along
white
oak
swamp
and
that
in
these
circumstances
longstreet
and
hill
would
probably
have
seized
the
quaker

his
failure
to
cross
the
creek
exposed
him
to
criticism
not
only
did
his
complain
of
his
inaction
but
franklin
the
federal
commander
immediately
opposed
to
him
writing
long
afterwards
made
the
following
comments
jackson
seems
to
have
been
ignorant
of
what
general
lee
expected
of
him
and
badly
informed
about
brackett
ford
when
he
found
how
strenuous
was
our
defence
at
the
bridge
he
should
have
turned
his
attention
to
brackett
ford
also
a
force
could
have
been
as
quietly
gathered
there
as
at
the
bridge
a
strong
infantry
movement
at
the
ford
would
have
easily
overrun
our
small
force
there
placing
our
right
at
glendale
held
by
slocum
division
in
great
jeopardy
and
turning
our
force
at
the
bridge
by
getting
between
it
and
glendale
in
fact
it
is
likely
that
we
should
have
been
defeated
that
day
had
general
jackson
done
what
his
great
reputation
seems
to
make
it
imperative
he
should
have
done
battles
and
leaders

as
to
the
ease
with
which
brackett
ford
might
have
been
passed
is
not
justified
by
the
facts
in
the
first
place
general
slocum
who
was
facing
huger
and
had
little
to
do
throughout
the
day
had
two
brigades
within
easy
distance
of
the
crossing
in
the
second
place
general
wright
reported
the
ford
impassable
and
in
the
third
place
general
franklin
himself
admits
that
directly
wright
scouts
were
seen
near
the
ford
two
brigades
of
sedgwick
division
were
sent
to
oppose
their
passage
general
long
in
his
life
of
lee
finds
excuse
for
jackson
in
a
story
that
he
was
utterly
exhausted
and
that
his
staff
let
him
sleep
until
the
sun
was
high
apart
from
the
unlikelihood
that
a
man
who
seems
to
have
done
without
sleep
whenever
the
enemy
was
in
front
should
have
permitted
himself
to
be
overpowered
at
such
a
crisis
we
have
colonel
munford
evidence
that
the
general
was
well
in
advance
of
his
columns
at
sunrise
and
the
regimental
reports
show
that
the
troops
were
roused
at
jackson
may
well
have
been
exhausted
he
had
certainly
not
spared
himself
during
the
operations
on
the
night
of
the
after
the
battle
of
gaines
mill
he
went
over
to
stuart
camp
at
midnight
and
a
long
conference
took
place
at
on
the
morning
of
the
he
visited
magruder
riding
across
grapevine
bridge
from
house
and
his
start
must
have
been
an
early
one
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
dated
near
the
white
oak
bridge
he
says
that
in
consequence
of
the
heavy
rain
he
rose
about
midnight
on
the
yet
his
medical
director
although
he
noticed
that
the
general
fell
asleep
while
he
was
eating
his
supper
the
same
evening
says
that
he
never
saw
him
more
active
and
energetic
than
during
the
engagement
letter
from
hunter
mcguire
to
the
author
and
jackson
himself
neither
in
his
report
nor
elsewhere
ever
admitted
that
he
was
in
any
way
to
blame
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
that
his
scrupulous
regard
for
truth
displayed
in
every
action
of
his
life
should
have
yielded
in
this
one
instance
to
his
pride
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
necessity
of
aiding
longstreet
and
if
owing
to
the
obstacles
enumerated
in
his
report
he
thought
the
task
impossible
his
opinion
as
that
of
a
man
who
as
difficulties
accumulated
became
the
more
determined
to
overcome
them
must
be
regarded
with
respect
the
critics
it
is
possible
have
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
the
condition
of
the
troops
is
a
factor
of
supreme
importance
in
military
operations
general
hill
has
told
us
that
jackson
own
corps
was
worn
out
by
long
and
exhausting
marches
and
reduced
in
numbers
by
numerous
sanguinary
battles
battles
and
leaders
volume
page
and
he
records
his
conviction
that
pity
for
his
troops
had
much
to
do
with
the
general
inaction
hill
would
have
probably
come
nearer
the
truth
if
he
had
said
that
the
tired
regiments
were
hardly
to
be
trusted
in
a
desperate
assault
unsupported
by
artillery
on
a
position
which
was
even
stronger
than
that
which
they
had
stormed
with
such
loss
at
gaines
mill
had
jackson
thrown
two
columns
across
the
fords
which
the
cavalry
according
to
munford
had
not
found
easy
and
attempted
to
deploy
on
the
further
bank
it
was
exceedingly
probable
that
they
would
have
been
driven
back
with
tremendous
slaughter
the
refusal
of
the
troops
to
work
at
the
bridge
under
fire
was
in
itself
a
sign
that
they
had
little
stomach
for
hard
fighting
it
may
be
argued
that
it
was
jackson
duty
to
sacrifice
his
command
in
order
to
draw
off
troops
from
glendale
but
on
such
unfavourable
ground
the
sacrifice
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
the
attack
repulsed
and
it
could
hardly
have
gone
otherwise
franklin
leaving
a
small
to
watch
the
fords
would
have
been
free
to
turn
nearly
his
whole
strength
against
longstreet
it
is
quite
true
as
a
tactical
principle
that
demonstrations
such
as
jackson
made
with
his
artillery
are
seldom
to
be
relied
upon
to
hold
an
enemy
in
position
when
the
first
alarm
has
passed
off
and
the
defending
general
becomes
aware
that
nothing
more
than
a
feint
is
intended
he
will
act
as
did
the
federals
and
employ
his
reserves
elsewhere
a
vigorous
attack
is
almost
invariably
the
only
means
of
keeping
him
to
his
ground
but
an
attack
which
is
certain
to
be
repulsed
and
to
be
repulsed
in
quick
time
is
even
less
effective
than
a
demonstration
it
may
be
the
precursor
of
a
decisive
defeat
but
it
is
not
so
much
for
his
failure
to
force
the
passage
at
white
oak
swamp
that
jackson
has
been
criticised
as
for
his
failure
to
march
to
frayser
farm
on
finding
that
the
federal
position
was
impregnable
when
on
the
forenoon
of
the
writes
longstreet
jackson
found
his
way
blocked
by
franklin
he
had
time
to
march
to
the
head
of
it
white
oak
swamp
and
across
to
the
charles
city
road
in
season
for
the
engagement
at
frayser
farm
glendale
the
distance
being
about
four
miles
from
manassas
to
appomattox
page
without
doubt
this
would
have
been
a
judicious
course
to
pursue
but
it
was
not
for
jackson
to
initiate
such
a
movement
he
had
been
ordered
by
general
lee
to
move
along
the
road
to
white
oak
swamp
to
endeavour
to
force
his
way
to
the
long
bridge
road
to
guard
left
flank
from
any
attack
across
the
fords
or
bridges
of
the
lower
chickahominy
and
to
keep
on
that
road
until
he
received
further
orders
these
further
orders
he
never
received
and
it
was
certainly
not
his
place
to
march
to
the
charles
city
road
until
lee
who
was
with
longstreet
sent
him
instructions
to
do
so
general
jackson
says
mcguire
demanded
of
his
subordinates
implicit
blind
obedience
he
gave
orders
in
his
own
peculiar
terse
rapid
way
and
he
did
not
permit
them
to
be
questioned
he
obeyed
his
own
superiors
in
the
same
fashion
at
white
oak
swamp
he
was
looking
for
some
message
from
general
lee
but
he
received
none
and
therefore
as
a
soldier
he
had
no
right
to
leave
the
road
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
about
july
the
night
before
we
started
to
gordonsville
crutchfield
pendleton
assistant
and
myself
were
discussing
the
campaign
just
finished
we
were
talking
about
the
affair
at
frayser
farm
and
wondering
if
it
would
have
been
better
for
jackson
with
part
of
his
force
to
have
moved
to
longstreet
aid
the
general
came
in
while
the
discussion
was
going
on
and
curtly
said
if
general
lee
had
wanted
me
he
could
have
sent
for
me
it
looked
the
day
after
the
battle
and
it
looks
to
me
now
that
if
general
lee
had
sent
a
staff
officer
who
could
have
ridden
the
distance
in
forty
minutes
to
order
jackson
with
three
divisions
to
the
cross
roads
while
hill
and
the
artillery
watched
franklin
we
should
certainly
have
crushed
mcclellan
army
if
lee
had
wanted
jackson
to
give
direct
support
to
longstreet
he
could
have
had
him
there
in
under
three
hours
the
staff
officer
was
not
sent
and
the
evidence
is
that
general
lee
believed
longstreet
strong
enough
to
defeat
the
federals
without
direct
aid
from
jackson
letter
to
the
author
such
reasoning
appears
incontrovertible
jackson
be
it
remembered
had
been
directed
to
guard
the
left
flank
of
the
army
until
further
orders
had
these
words
been
omitted
and
he
had
been
left
free
to
follow
his
own
judgment
it
is
possible
that
he
would
have
joined
huger
on
the
charles
city
road
with
three
divisions
but
in
all
probability
he
felt
himself
tied
down
by
the
phrase
which
moltke
so
strongly
reprobates
despite
statement
jackson
knew
well
that
disobedience
to
orders
may
sometimes
be
condoned
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
invariably
demanded
blind
obedience
general
said
an
officer
you
blame
me
for
disobedience
of
orders
but
in
mexico
you
did
the
same
yourself
but
i
was
successful
was
jackson
reply
as
much
as
to
say
that
an
officer
when
he
takes
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
ignoring
the
explicit
instructions
of
his
superior
must
be
morally
certain
that
he
is
doing
what
that
superior
were
he
present
would
approve
apply
this
rule
to
the
situation
at
white
oak
swamp
for
anything
jackson
knew
it
was
possible
that
longstreet
and
hill
might
defeat
the
federals
opposed
to
them
without
his
aid
in
such
case
lee
believing
jackson
to
be
still
on
the
left
flank
would
have
ordered
him
to
prevent
the
enemy
escape
by
the
long
bridge
what
would
lee
have
said
had
his
further
orders
found
jackson
marching
to
the
charles
city
road
with
the
long
bridge
some
miles
in
rear
the
truth
is
that
the
principle
of
marching
to
the
sound
of
the
cannon
though
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
can
not
be
invariably
followed
the
only
fair
criticism
on
jackson
conduct
is
that
he
should
have
informed
lee
of
his
inability
to
force
the
passage
across
the
swamp
and
have
held
three
divisions
in
readiness
to
march
to
glendale
this
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
was
left
undone
but
the
evidence
is
merely
negative
except
for
this
apparent
omission
it
can
not
be
fairly
said
that
jackson
was
in
the
slightest
degree
responsible
for
the
failure
of
the
confederate
operations
if
the
truth
be
told
lee
design
was
by
no
means
perfect
it
had
two
serious
defects
in
the
first
place
it
depended
for
success
on
the
of
several
converging
columns
moving
over
an
intricate
country
of
which
the
confederates
had
neither
accurate
maps
nor
reliable
information
the
march
of
the
columns
was
through
thick
woods
which
not
only
impeded
intercommunication
but
provided
the
enemy
with
ample
material
for
obstructing
the
roads
and
jackson
line
of
march
was
barred
by
a
formidable
obstacle
in
white
oak
swamp
an
admirable
position
for
a
in
the
second
place
concentration
at
the
decisive
point
was
not
provided
for
the
staff
proved
incapable
of
keeping
the
divisions
in
hand
magruder
was
permitted
to
wander
to
and
fro
after
the
fashion
of
between
quatre
bras
and
ligny
holmes
was
as
useless
as
grouchy
at
waterloo
huger
did
nothing
although
some
of
his
brigades
when
the
roads
to
the
front
were
found
to
be
obstructed
might
easily
have
been
drawn
off
to
reinforce
longstreet
the
cavalry
had
gone
off
on
a
raid
to
the
white
house
instead
of
crossing
the
chickahominy
and
harassing
the
enemy
eastward
flank
and
at
the
decisive
point
only
two
divisions
were
assembled
men
all
told
and
these
two
divisions
attacked
in
succession
instead
of
simultaneously
had
magruder
and
holmes
neither
of
whom
would
have
been
called
upon
to
march
more
than
thirteen
miles
moved
on
frayser
farm
and
had
part
of
huger
division
been
brought
over
to
the
same
point
the
federals
would
in
all
probability
have
been
irretrievably
defeated
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
the
circumstances
were
extraordinary
an
army
of
men
was
pursuing
an
army
of
of
which
when
the
pursuit
began
were
perfectly
fresh
troops
the
problem
was
indeed
one
of
exceeding
difficulty
but
in
justice
to
the
reputation
of
his
lieutenants
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
lee
solution
was
not
a
masterpiece
during
the
night
which
followed
the
battle
of
frayser
farm
the
whole
federal
army
fell
back
on
malvern
hill
a
strong
position
commanding
the
country
for
many
miles
and
very
difficult
of
access
on
which
the
reserve
artillery
supported
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
corps
was
already
posted
july
the
confederates
marching
at
daybreak
passed
over
roads
which
were
strewn
with
arms
blankets
and
equipments
stragglers
from
the
retreating
army
were
picked
up
at
every
step
scores
of
wounded
men
lay
untended
by
the
roadside
waggons
and
ambulances
had
been
abandoned
and
with
such
evidence
before
their
eyes
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
conviction
that
the
enemy
was
utterly
demoralised
that
mcclellan
had
seized
malvern
hill
and
that
it
was
strongly
occupied
by
heavy
guns
lee
was
well
aware
but
still
holding
to
his
purpose
of
annihilating
his
enemy
before
mcdowell
could
intervene
from
fredericksburg
he
pushed
forward
determined
to
attack
and
with
his
whole
force
now
well
in
hand
the
result
seemed
assured
three
or
four
miles
south
of
white
oak
swamp
jackson
column
which
was
leading
the
confederate
advance
came
under
the
fire
of
the
federal
batteries
the
advanced
guard
deployed
in
the
woods
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
lee
accompanied
by
jackson
rode
forward
to
reconnoitre
malvern
hill
a
plateau
rising
to
the
height
of
feet
above
the
surrounding
forests
possessed
nearly
every
requirement
of
a
strong
defensive
position
the
open
ground
on
the
top
undulating
and
unobstructed
was
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
by
half
a
mile
in
breadth
to
the
north
and
it
fell
gradually
the
slopes
covered
with
wheat
standing
or
in
shock
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
which
are
from
eight
to
sixteen
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
commanding
crest
the
base
of
the
hill
except
to
the
east
and
was
covered
with
dense
forest
and
within
the
forest
at
the
foot
of
the
declivity
ran
a
tortuous
and
marshy
stream
the
right
flank
was
partially
protected
by
a
long
the
left
more
open
afforded
an
excellent
artillery
position
overlooking
a
broad
stretch
of
meadows
drained
by
a
narrow
stream
and
deep
ditches
and
flanked
by
the
fire
of
several
gunboats
only
three
approaches
the
quaker
and
the
river
roads
and
a
track
from
the

access
to
the
heights
the
reconnaissance
showed
that
general
porter
commanding
the
defence
had
utilised
the
ground
to
the
best
advantage
a
powerful
artillery
posted
just
in
rear
of
the
crest
swept
the
entire
length
of
the
slopes
and
under
cover
in
rear
were
dense
masses
of
infantry
with
a
strong
line
of
skirmishers
pushed
down
the
hill
in
front
nevertheless
despite
the
formidable
nature
of
the
federal
preparations
orders
were
immediately
issued
for
attack
general
lee
who
was
indisposed
had
instructed
longstreet
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
left
and
to
report
whether
attack
was
feasible
jackson
was
opposed
to
a
frontal
attack
preferring
to
turn
the
enemy
right
longstreet
however
was
of
a
different
opinion
the
spacious
open
he
says
along
jackson
front
appeared
to
offer
a
field
for
play
of
a
hundred
or
more
guns
i
thought
it
probable
that
batteries
under
the
of
the
confederates
guns
posted
on
his
left
and
front
could
be
thrown
into
disorder
and
thus
make
way
for
the
combined
assaults
of
the
infantry
i
so
reported
and
general
lee
ordered
disposition
accordingly
sending
the
pioneer
corps
to
cut
a
road
for
the
right
batteries
from
manassas
to
appomattox
page
it
was
not
till
four
that
the
line
of
battle
was
formed
jackson
was
on
the
left
with
whiting
to
the
left
of
the
quaker
road
and
hill
to
the
right
ewell
and
jackson
own
divisions
were
in
reserve
nearly
half
a
mile
beyond
jackson
right
came
two
of
huger
brigades
armistead
and
wright
and
to
huger
left
rear
was
magruder
holmes
still
on
the
river
road
was
to
assail
the
left
longstreet
and
hill
were
in
reserve
behind
magruder
on
the
long
bridge
road
the
deployment
of
the
leading
divisions
was
not
effected
without
loss
for
the
federal
artillery
swept
all
the
roads
and
poured
a
heavy
fire
into
the
woods
but
at
length
hill
infantry
came
into
line
along
the
edge
of
the
timber
the
intervening
time
had
been
employed
in
bringing
the
artillery
to
the
front
and
now
were
seen
the
tremendous
difficulties
which
confronted
the
attack
the
swamps
and
thickets
through
which
the
batteries
had
to
force
their
way
were
grievous
impediments
to
rapid
or
orderly
movement
and
when
they
at
last
emerged
from
the
cover
and
unlimbered
for
action
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
federal
guns
overpowered
them
from
the
outset
in
front
of
huger
four
batteries
were
disabled
in
quick
succession
the
enemy
concentrating
fifty
or
sixty
guns
on
each

jackson

with

exceptions
they
managed
to
hold
their
ground

powerless
to
subdue
the
hostile
fire
the
obstacles
says
lee
in
his
report
presented
by
the
woods
and
swamp
made
it
impracticable
to
bring
up
a
sufficient
amount
of
artillery
to
oppose
successfully
the
extraordinary
force
of
that
arm
employed
by
the
enemy
while
the
field
itself
afforded
us
few
positions
favourable
for
its
use
and
none
for
its
proper
concentration
according
to
longstreet
when
the
inability
of
the
batteries
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
infantry
was
demonstrated
by
their
defeat
lee
abandoned
the
original
plan
of
attack
he
proposed
to
me
to
move
round
to
the
left
with
my
own
and
hill
division
and
turn
the
federal
right
i
issued
my
orders
accordingly
for
the
two
divisions
to
go
around
and
turn
the
federal
right
when
in
some
way
unknown
to
me
the
battle
was
drawn
on
battles
and
leaders
volume
page
unfortunately
through
some
mistake
on
the
part
of
lee
staff
the
order
of
attack
which
had
been
already
issued
was
not
rescinded
it
was
certainly
an
extraordinary
production
batteries
it
ran
have
been
established
to
rake
the
enemy
line
if
it
is
broken

is
probable

the

this
was
to
hill
and
to
magruder
who
had
under
his
command
huger
and
mclaws
divisions
as
well
as
his
own
so
between

and

general
hill
believing
that
he
heard
the
appointed
signal
broke
forward
from
the
timber
and
five
brigades
in
one
irregular
line
charged
full
against
the
enemy
front
the
federals
disposed
in
several
lines
were
in
overwhelming
strength
their
batteries
were
free
to
concentrate
on
the
advancing
infantry
their
riflemen
posted
in
the
interval
between
the
artillery
masses
swept
the
long
slopes
with
a
grazing
fire
while
fence
bank
and
ravine
gave
shelter
from
the
confederate
bullets
nor
were
the
enormous
difficulties
which
confronted
the
attack
in
any
way
mitigated
by
careful
arrangement
on
the
part
of
the
confederate
staff
the
only
hope
of
success
if
success
were
possible
lay
in
one
strong
concentrated
effort
in
employing
the
whole
army
in
supporting
the
infantry
with
artillery
regardless
of
loss
at
close
range
and
in
hurling
a
mass
of
men
in
several
successive
lines
against
one
point
of
the
enemy
position
it
is
possible
that
the
federal
army
already
demoralised
by
retreat
might
have
yielded
to
such
vigorous
pressure
but
in
the
confederate
attack
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
at
concentration
the
order
which
dictated
it
gave
an
opening
to
misunderstanding
and
as
is
almost
invariably
the
case
when
orders
are
defective
misunderstanding
occurred
the
movement
was
premature
magruder
had
only
two
brigades
of
his
three
divisions
armistead
and
wright
in
position
armistead
who
was
well
in
advance
of
the
confederate
right
was
attacked
by
a
strong
body
of
skirmishers
hill
took
the
noise
of
this
conflict
for
the
appointed
signal
and
moved
forward
the
divisions
which
should
have
supported
him
had
not
yet
crossed
the
swamp
in
rear
and
thus
men
absolutely
unaided
advanced
against
the
whole
federal
army
the
blunder
met
with
terrible
retribution
on
that
midsummer
evening
death
reaped
a
fearful
harvest
the
gallant
confederate
infantry
nerved
by
their
success
at
gaines
mill
swept
up
the
field
with
splendid
determination
it
was
the
onset
of
battle
said
a
federal
officer
present
with
the
good
order
of
a
review
but
the
iron
hail
of
grape
and
canister
laying
the
ripe
wheat
low
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
a
sickle
and
tossing
the
shocks
in
air
rent
the
advancing
lines
from
end
to
end
hundreds
fell
hundreds
swarmed
back
to
the
woods
but
still
the
brigades
pressed
on
and
through
the
smoke
of
battle
the
waving
colours
led
the
charge
but
the
federal
infantry
had
yet
to
be
encountered
lying
behind
their
shelter
they
had
not
yet
fired
a
shot
but
as
the
confederates
reached
close
range
regiment
after
regiment
springing
to
their
feet
poured
a
devastating
fire
into
the
charging
ranks
the
rush
was
checked
here
and
there
small
bodies
of
desperate
men
following
the
colours
still
pressed
onward
but
the
majority
lay
down
and
the
whole
front
of
battle
rang
with
the
roar
of
musketry
but
so
thin
was
the
confederate
line
that
it
was
impossible
to
overcome
the
sustained
fire
of
the
enemy
the
brigade
reserves
had
already
been
thrown
in
there
was
no
further
support
at
hand
the
federal
gunners
staunch
and
resolute
held
fast
to
their
position
and
on
every
part
of
the
line
porter
reserves
were
coming
up
as
one
regiment
emptied
its
it
was
relieved
by
another
the
volume
of
fire
never
for
a
moment
slackened
and
fresh
batteries
amongst
which
were
the
of
the
siege
train
unlimbering
on
the
flanks
gave
further
strength
to
a
front
which
was
already
impregnable
map
of
the
battle
of
malvern
hill
jackson
meanwhile
on
receiving
a
request
for
reinforcements
had
sent
forward
three
brigades
of
his
own
division
and
a
brigade
of
hill
but
a
mistake
had
been
committed
in
the
disposition
of
these
troops
the
order
for
attack
had
undoubtedly
named
only
division
but
there
was
no
good
reason
that
it
should
have
been
so
literally
construed
as
to
leave
the
division
unsupported
whiting
was
guarding
the
left
flank
and
was
not
available
but
ewell
and
winder
were
doing
nothing
and
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
they
should
have
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
directly
hill
moved
forward
and
have
followed
his
brigades
across
the
open
ready
to
lend
aid
directly
his
line
was
checked
as
it
was
they
had
been
halted
within
the
woods
and
beyond
the
swamp
and
the
greater
part
in
order
to
avoid
the
random
shells
had
moved
even
further
to
the
rear
it
thus
happened
that
before
the
reinforcements
arrived
division
had
been
beaten
back
and
under
the
tremendous
fire
of
the
federal
artillery
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
border
of
the
forest
was
maintained
while
hill
was
retiring
huger
and
then
magruder
came
into
action
on
the
right
it
had
been
reported
to
lee
that
the
enemy
was
beginning
to
fall
back
this
report
originated
there
can
be
little
doubt
in
the
withdrawal
of
the
federal
regiments
and
batteries
which
had
exhausted
their
ammunition
and
were
relieved
by
others
but
in
any
case
it
was
imperative
that
hill
should
be
supported
and
the
other
divisions
were
ordered
forward
with
all
speed
huger
and
magruder
men
attacked
with
the
same
determination
as
had
been
displayed
by
hill
but
no
better
success
attended
their
endeavours
the
brigades
were
not
properly
formed
when
the
order
arrived
but
scattered
over
a
wide
front
and
they
went
in
piecemeal
losses
were
even
greater
than
hill
and
with
his
defeat
the
battle
ceased
had
the
federals
followed
up
the
repulse
with
a
strong
the
victory
of
malvern
hill
might
have
been
more
decisive
than
that
of
gaines
mill
it
is
true
that
neither
longstreet
nor
hill
had
been
engaged
and
that
three
of
jackson
divisions
his
own
whiting
and
ewell
had
suffered
little
but
magruder
and
hill
whose
commands
included
at
least
muskets
one
half
of
lee
infantry
had
been
completely
crushed
and
holmes
on
the
river
road
was
too
far
off
to
lend
assistance
the
fatal
influence
of
a
continued
retreat
had
paralysed
however
the
initiative
of
the
federal
generals
intent
only
on
getting
away
unscathed
they
neglected
like
mcclellan
at
gaines
mill
to
look
for
opportunities
forgetting
that
when
an
enemy
is
pursuing
in
hot
haste
he
is
very
apt
to
expose
himself
jackson
had
acted
otherwise
at
port
republic
the
loss
of
over
men
was
not
the
worst
which
had
befallen
the
confederates
the
next
morning
by
dawn
says
one
of
brigadiers
i
went
off
to
ask
for
orders
when
i
found
the
whole
army
in
the
utmost
disorder
thousands
of
straggling
men
were
asking
every
for
their
regiments
ambulances
waggons
and
artillery

every
road

altogether

drenching

the
most
woeful
and
disheartening
confusion

there
can
be
no
question
that
demoralisation

set
in
whether
if
the
federals
had
used
their
large
reserves
with
resolution
and
as
the
confederates
fell
back
down
the
slopes
had
followed
with
the
bayonet
the
demoralisation
would
not
have
increased
and
spread
must
remain
in
doubt
not
one
of
the
southern
generals
engaged
has
made
public
his
opinion
there
is
but
one
thing
certain
that
with
an
opponent
so
blind
to
opportunity
as
mcclellan
a
strong
counterstroke
was
the
last
thing
to
be
feared
after
witnessing
the
opening
of
the
attack
the
federal
commander
leaving
the
control
of
the

ridden
off
to

his

escorted
by

been
directed
and
where
he
had
determined
to
await

the
federal
troops
moreover
although
they
had
withstood
the
charge
of
the
confederate
infantry
with
unbroken
ranks
had
not
fought
with
the
same
spirit

they

whatever
may

the

reached
the
last
stage
of
demoralisation
the
condition
to
which
mcclellan
was
reduced
seems
to
have
been
realised
by
jackson
the
crushing
defeat
of
his
own
troops
failed
to
disturb
his
judgment
whilst
the
night
still
covered
the
his
divisional
generals
came
to
report
the
condition
of
their
men
and
to
receive
instructions
every
representation
says
dabney
which
they
made
was
gloomy
at
length
after
many
details
of
losses
and
disasters
they
concurred
in
declaring
that
mcclellan
would
probably
take
the
aggressive
in
the
morning
and
that
the
confederate
army
was
in
no
condition
to
resist
him
jackson
had
listened
silently
save
when
he
interposed
a
few
brief
questions
to
all
their
statements
but
now
he
replied
no
he
will
clear
out
in
the
morning
july
the
forecast
was
more
than
fulfilled
when
morning
dawned
grey
damp
and
cheerless
and
the
confederate
sentinels
through
the
cold
mist
which
rose
from
the
sodden
woods
looked
out
upon
the

saw
that
malvern

had
been
abandoned
only
a
few
cavalry
patrols
rode
to

had
been
held
by

on

dying
men
the

were
quietly
at
work
during
the

the
enemy
had
fallen
back
to

justification
for
lee
assault
at

may
be
found
in

nearly
half

not

jackson
the
moment
it
was
light
rode
through
the
rain
to
the
front
learning
that
the
enemy
had
evacuated

position
he
ordered
his
chief
of

to
get
the
troops
under

to
form

in

lines

no

major
dabney
rode
off
to
find
his

near

in

his

had
been
fulfilled
i
was
introduced
to

lee

with
his
usual
kindness
begged
me
to
sit
by
the
fire
and
dry
myself
here
i
stayed
much
of
the
day
and
witnessed
some
strange
things
longstreet
wet
and
muddy
was
the
first
to
enter
he
had
ridden
round
most
of
the
and
his
report
was
not
particularly
cheerful
jackson
was
very
quiet
never
volunteering
any
counsel
or
suggestion
but
answering
when
questioned
in
a
brief
deferential
tone
his
countenance
was
very
serious
and
soon
became
very
troubled
after
a
time
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
was
heard
and
two
gentlemen
came
in
dripping
they
were
the
president
and
his
nephew
davis
and
lee
then
drew
to
the
table
and
entered
into
an
animated
military
discussion
lee
told
the
president
the
news
which
the
scouts
were
bringing
in
of
horrible
mud
and
of
abandoned
arms
and
baggage
waggons
they
then
debated
at
length
what
was
to
be
done
next
mcclellan
was
certainly
retiring
but
whether
as
beaten
or
as
only
manoeuvring
was
not
apparent
nor
was
the
direction
of
his
retreat
at
all
clear
was
he
aiming
for
some
point
on
the
lower
james
where
he
might
embark
and
get
away
or
at
some
point
on
the
upper
james
say
shirley
or
bermuda
hundred
where
he
could
cross
the
river
he
had
pontoons
and
gunboats
and
advance
on
richmond
from
the
south
such
were
the
questions
which
came
up
and
at
length
it
was
decided
that
the
army
should
make
no
movement
until
further
information
had
been
received
the
enemy
was
not
to
be
pursued
until
stuart
cavalry
which
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
at
nance
shop
should
obtain
reliable
information
jackson
meanwhile
sat
silent
in
his
corner
i
watched
his
face
the
expression
changing
from
surprise
to
dissent
and
lastly
to
intense
mortification
showed
clearly
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
he
knew
that
mcclellan
was
defeated
that
he
was
retreating
and
not
manoeuvring
he
knew
that
his
troops
were
disorganised
that
sleeplessness
fasting
bad
weather
and
disaster
must
have
weakened
their
morale
he
heard
it
said
by
general
lee
that
the
scouts
reported
the
roads
so
deep
in
mud
that
the
artillery
could
not
move
that
our
men
were
wet
and
wearied
but
jackson
mind
reasoned
that
where
the
federals
could
march
the
confederates
could
follow
and
that
a
decisive
victory
was
well
worth
a
great
effort
letter
to
the
author
mcguire
writes
to
the
same
effect
july
the
decision
of
the
council
of
war
was
that
the
army
should
move
the
next
morning
in
the
direction
of
harrison
landing
longstreet
whose
troops
had
not
been
engaged
at
malvern
hill
was
to
lead
the
way
but
the
operations
of
this
day
were
without
result
the
line
of
march
was
by
carter
mill
and
the
river
road
but
after
the
troops
had
been
set
in
motion
it
was
found
that
the
river
road
had
been
obstructed
by
the
enemy
and
lee
directed
longstreet
to
countermarch
to
the
charles
city
cross
roads
and
move
on
evelington
heights
evelington
heights
are
between
rawling
mill
pond
and
westover
but
ignorance
of
the
country
and
inefficient
guides
once
more
played
into
the
enemy
hands
and
when
night
closed
the
troops
were
still
some
distance
from
the
federal
outposts
the
delay
had
been
exceedingly
unfortunate
at
cavalry
had
occupied
the
evelington
heights
and
believing
that
longstreet
was
close
at
hand
had
opened
fire
with
a
single
howitzer
on
the
camps
below
the
consternation
caused
by
this
attack
was
great
but
the
federals
soon
recovered
from
their
surprise
and
warned
as
to
the
danger
of
their
situation
sent
out
infantry
and
artillery
to
drive
back
the
enemy
and
secure
the
heights
stuart
dismounting
his
troopers
held
on
for
some
time
but
at
two
finding
that
the
confederate
infantry
was
still
six
or
seven
miles
distant
and
that
his
ammunition
was
failing
he
gave
up
the
heights
which
were
immediately
fortified
by
the
enemy
had
the
cavalry
commander
resisted
the
temptation
of
spreading
panic
in
the
enemy
ranks
and
kept
his
troops
under
cover
infantry
and
artillery
might
possibly
have
been
brought
up
to
the
heights
before
they
were
occupied
by
the
federals
in
any
case
it
was
utterly
useless
to
engage
a
whole
army
with
one
gun
and
a
few
regiments
of
cavalry
and
in
war
especially
in
advanced
guard
operations
silence
is
often
golden
the
military
student
will
compare
the
battles
of
weissembourg
vionville
and
gravelotte
in
all
of
which
began
with
a
useless
surprise
it
was
not
till
they
were
warned
by
the
fire
of
stuart
howitzer
that
the
federals
realised
the
necessity
of
securing
and
intrenching
the
evelington
heights
and
it
is
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
had
they
been
left
undisturbed
that
they
might
have
neglected
them
altogether
mcclellan
according
to
his
letters
already
quoted
believed
that
the
condition
of
the
roads
would
retard
the
advance
of
the
enemy
and
as
is
evident
from
a
letter
he
wrote
the
same
morning
before
the
incident
took
place
he
was
of
opinion
that
there
was
no
immediate
need
for
the
occupation
of
a
defensive
position

divisions
crawling
in

had
marched
only
three
miles

such
sluggish
progress
at
so
critical
a
moment
put
the
climax
to
jackson
discontent
his
wrath
blazed
forth
with
unwonted
vehemence
that
night
says
dabney
letter
to
the

he
was
quartered
in
a
farmhouse
a
mile
or
two
east
of

church
the
soldier
assigned
to
him
as
a
guide
made
a
most
stupid
report
and
admitted
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
road
jackson
turned
on
him
in
fierce
anger
and
ordered
him
from
his
presence
with
threats
of
the
severest
punishment
on
retiring
he
said
to
his
staff
now
gentlemen
jim
will
have
breakfast
for
you
punctually
at

i
expect
you
to
be
up
to
eat
immediately

be
in

without

must
burn
no

i
heard
him
tramping
down

i
alone
went
out
to
meet
him
all
the
rest
were
asleep
he
addressed
me
in
stern

how
is
it
that
this

never

be
punctual
i
replied
i
am
in

jackson
turned
in

i
suggested
very
humbly
that
he
had
better
at

take
some
food
himself
but
he
was
too
angry
to
eat
and
repeating
his
orders
flung
himself
into
the

galloped
off

came
up

the
morning
of
the
he
found
the
pickets
already
engaged
and
the
troops
formed
up
in
readiness
for
action
he
immediately
rode
forward
with
jackson
and
the
two
dismounting
proceeded
without
staff
or
escort
to
make
a
careful
reconnaissance
of
the
position
their
inspection
showed
them
that
it
was
practically
impregnable
the
front
facing
westward
was
flanked
from

by
the
fire
of
the
gunboats
and
the
evelington
heights
already
fortified
and
approached
by
a

road
were
stronger
ground
than

the
troops
were
therefore
withdrawn
to
the

for
the
next
three
days

exception
of

employed
in

not

by
a

estimate
of
the

in

and
in

the
discomfited
general
sought
to
cover
his
failure
by
a
lavish
employment
of
strategic
phrases
the
retreat
to
the
james
he
declared
had
been
planned
before
the
battle
of
mechanicsville
he
had
merely
manoeuvred
to
get
quit
of
an
inconvenient
line
of
supply
and
to
place
his
army
in
a
more
favourable
position

attacking

congratulated
his
troops
on
their
success
in
changing
the
line
of
operations
always
regarded
as
the
most
hazardous
of
military
expedients
their
conduct
he
said
ranked
them
among
the
most
celebrated
armies
of
history
under
every
disadvantage
of
numbers
and
necessarily
of
position
also
they
had
in

is

that
this

soothed
the

certainly
deluded
neither
his

nor
the
south
the
immediate
effect

his
strategic
manoeuvre

was
asked
to
reinforce

lincoln
called
on
the
northern
states
for
a
fresh
levy
but
although
men
were
promised
him
the
discouragement
of

great

beleaguered

the
enemy
was
in
position
not
more
than
twenty
miles
away

that

agony

over

one
vast
hospital
many
of
the

of
the

fallen
in

seven
days
and
the
voice
of
mourning
hushed
all
sound
of
triumph
but
the
long
columns
of
prisoners
the
captured
cannon
the
great
trains
of
waggons
piled
high
with
spoil
were
irrefragable
proof
of

complete
defeat
of
the
invader

the

encamped

was
received

were
the
special
objects
of

strategic
skill
which

wrought

overthrow

the
hard

from
the

ridge
to

fast
hold
of
the
popular
imagination

mystery
in
which
operations
were
involved
the
dread
he
inspired
in
the
enemy
his
reticence
his
piety
his
contempt
of
comfort
his
fiery
energy
his
fearlessness
and
his
simplicity
aroused
the
interest
and
enthusiasm
of
the
whole
community
whether
lee
or
his
lieutenant
was
the
more
averse
to
posing
before
the
crowd
it
is
difficult
to
say
both
succeeded
in
escaping
all
public
manifestation
of
popular
favour
both
went
about
their
business
with
an
absolute
absence
of
ostentation
and
if
the
handsome

of
the
were
familiar
to
the
majority
of

recognised

the
plainly
dressed
soldier
riding
alone
through

the
great
leader
of
the
valley
with
whose
praises
not
the
south
only
but
the
whole
civilised
world
was
already
ringing

the
victories
in
the
valley
the
retreat
of

shields
and

followed
by
the
victory
of

had
raised
the
hopes
of
the
south
to
the
highest
pitch
when
mcclellan
fell
back
to
the
james
the
capture
or
destruction
of
his
army
seemed
a
mere
matter
of
time
and
it
was
confidently
expected
that
a
disaster
of
such
magnitude
would
assuredly
bring
the
north
to
terms
but
the
slaughter
of
the
confederates
at
malvern

the
unmolested
retreat
of
the
enemy
to

landing
the
fortification
of
that
strong
position
induced
a
more
sober
mood
the
northern
soldiers
had
displayed
a
courage
for
which
the
south
had
not
yet
given
them
credit
on
the
last
of
the
seven
days
they
had
fought
almost
as
stubbornly
as
on
the
first
their
losses
had
been
heavy
but
they
had
taught
their
adversaries
that
they
were
no
longer
the
unmanageable
levies
of
bull
run
scattered
by
the
first
touch
of
disaster
to
the
four
winds
it
was
no
frail
barrier
which
stood
now
between
the
south
and
her
independence
but
a
great
army
of
trained
soldiers
seasoned
by
experience
bound
together
by
discipline
and
capable
of
withstanding
a
long
series
of
reverses
and
when
it
became
clear
that
mcclellan
backed
by
the
fleet
had
no
intention
of
losing
his
grip
on
richmond
when
the
news
came
that
lincoln
had
asked
for
fresh
troops
and
that
the
federal
army
of
the
west
undisturbed
by
lee
victories
was
still
advancing
through
tennessee
after
the
repulse
of
the
confederates
at
malvern
hill
and
the
unmolested
retreat
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
to
landing
lincoln
cancelled
his
demand
for
troops
from
the
west
the
power
and
persistency
of
the
north
were
revealed
in
all
their
huge
proportions
but
the
disappointment
of
the
southern
people
in
no
way
abated
their
gratitude
the
troops
drank
their
fill
of
praise
the
deeds
of
the
valley
regiments
were
on
every
tongue
the
stonewall
brigade
was
the
most
famous
organisation
in
the
confederacy
to
have
marched
with
jackson
was
a
sure
passport
to
the
good
graces
of
every
citizen
envied
by
their
comrades
regarded
as
heroes
by
the
admiring
crowds
that
thronged
the
camps
the
ragged
soldiers
of
the
shenandoah
found
ample
compensation
for
their
labour
they
had
indeed
earned
the
rest
which
was
now
given
them
for
more
than
two
months
they
had
been
marching
and
fighting
without
cessation
since
they
left
elk
run
on
april
until
they
fell
back
to
the
capital
on
july
their
camps
had
never
stood
in
the
same
spot
for
more
than
four
days
in
succession
but
neither
they
nor
their
general
looked
forward
to
a
long
sojourn
within
the
works
round
richmond
the
men
pined
for
the
fresh
breezes
of
their
native
highlands
the
tainted
atmosphere
of
a
district
which
was
one
vast
told
upon
their
health
and
the
people
of
richmond
despite
their
kindness
were
strangers
after
all
nor
was
jackson
less
anxious
to
leave
the
capital
the
heavy
rain
which
had
deluged
the
bivouac
on
the
chickahominy
had
chilled
him
to
the
bone
during
the
whole
of
the
pursuit
from
white
oak
swamp
to
westover
he
had
suffered
from
fever
but
his
longing
for
a
move
westward
was
dictated
by
other
motives
than
the
restoration
of
his
health
no
sooner
had
it
become
evident
that
mcclellan
position
was
impregnable
than
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
some
more
vulnerable
point
he
would
allow
the
enemy
no
respite
in
his
opinion
there
should
be
no
letting
up
in
the
attack
the
north
should
be
given
no
leisure
to
reorganise
the
armies
or
to
train
recruits
a
swift
succession
of
fierce
blows
delivered
at
a
vital
point
was
the
only
means
of
bringing
the
colossus
to
its
knees
and
that
vital
point
was
far
from
richmond
before
the
confederate
troops
marched
back
to
richmond
he
laid
his
views
before
the
member
of
congress
for
the
winchester
district
and
begged
boteler
to
impress
them
on
the
government
army
he
said
was
manifestly
thoroughly
beaten
incapable
of
moving
until
it
had
been
reorganised
and
reinforced
there
was
danger
he
foresaw
that
the
fruits
of
victory
would
be
lost
as
they
had
been
lost
after
bull
run
the
confederate
army
should
at
once
leave
the
malarious
district
round
richmond
and
moving
northwards
carry
the
horrors
of
invasion
across
the
border
this
he
said
was
the
only
way
to
bring
the
north
to
its
senses
and
to
end
the
war
and
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
confederates
if
they
were
to
concentrate
their
resources
to
make
a
successful
bid
for
victory
men
might
march
into
maryland
and
threaten
washington
but
while
he
was
anxious
that
these
views
should
be
laid
before
the
president
he
would
earnestly
disclaim
the
charge
of
he
wished
to
follow
and
not
to
lead
he
was
willing
to
follow
anyone
lee
or
ewell
or
anyone
who
would
fight
why
do
you
not
urge
your
views
asked
boteler
on
general
lee
i
have
done
so
replied
jackson
and
what
does
he
say
to
them
he
says
nothing
was
the
answer
but
do
not
understand
that
i
complain
of
this
silence
it
is
proper
that
general

should
observe
it
he
is
wise
and
prudent
he
feels

jackson
was
perfectly
right
in
his
estimate
of
the
federal
army
mcclellan
had
men
but
were
sick
and
he
was
still
under
the
delusion
that
he
had
been
defeated
by
more
than
twice
his
numbers
his
letters
to
the
president
it
is
true
betrayed
no
misgiving
he
was
far
from
admitting
that
he
had
been
defeated
his
army
he
wrote
was
now
so
favourably
placed
that
an
advance
on
richmond
was
easy
he
was
full
of
confidence
he
was
watching
carefully
for
any
fault
committed
by
the
enemy
and
would
take
advantage
of
it
the
spirit
of
his
army
he
declared
was
such
that
he
felt
unable
to
restrain
it
from
speedily
assuming
the
offensive
he
had
determined
not
to
fall
back
unless
he
was
absolutely
forced
to
do
so
he
was
ready
for
a
rapid
and
heavy
blow
at
richmond
but
to
strike
that
blow
he
required
heavy
reinforcements
and
while
waiting
their
arrival
he
was
unwilling
to
leave

the
situation

mcclellan

he
might
be
superseded
by

reduced

it
was

however
was

with
a
more
congenial
duty

he
was
absolutely
convinced
had
no
intention

this

sufficient
to
protect
the

would
they
not
rather
think
it
necessary
to
recall
mcclellan
the
experiment
was
worth
trying
after
some
delay
in
recovering
from
the
disorganisation
caused
by
the
disasters
in
the

pope
had
assembled
his
army
east
of

was
no
more
than
forty

north

already
advancing
it
was
essential
that
the

chief

should
be
protected

as

his

was
up

he
had
had

however
found
it

to
comply
with
his

request
for
such

as
would
enable
him
to
assume

the
army
covering

was
much
smaller
than

the
confederates
were
aware
that
a

had
landed

assistance
was

advanced
so
far
south
that

could

pope

off

was
to
entice
him
forward
a
week

away
without
any
movement

the
part
of

knew

he
said

had
not
observed
the
opportunity

according

was

whatever

is
certain
that
both
he
and
lee
were
in
close

believed
that
the
best
method
of
protecting

was
in

to
find
the
main

are

says
lee
on

in
not
attacking

in
their

and
chosen
positions

ought
always
to
be
turned
as
you

within
twenty

of

it
became
clear
that
he
intended
advancing

his
infantry
however
had
not
yet
crossed
hazel

and
jackson
carefully
concealing
his
troops
remained
on
the
watch
for
a
few
days
longer
his
anxiety
however
to
bring
his
enemy
to
battle
was
even
greater
than
usual
pope
had
already
gained
an
unenviable
notoriety
on
taking
over
command
he
had
issued
an
extraordinary
address
his
bombast
was
only
equalled
by
his
want
of
tact
not
content
with
extolling
the
prowess
of
the
western
troops
with
whom
he
had
hitherto
served
he
was
bitterly
satirical
at
the
expense
of
mcclellan
and
of
mcclellan
army
i
have
come
to
you
he
said
to
his
soldiers
from
the
west
where
we
have
always
seen
the
backs
of
our
enemies
from
an
army
whose
business
it
has
been
to
seek
the
adversary
and
beat
him
when
found
whose
policy
has
been
attack
and
not
defence
i
presume
that
i
have
been
called
here
to
pursue
the
same
system
and
to
lead
you
against
the
enemy
it
is
my
purpose
to
do
so
and
that
speedily
meantime
i
desire
you
to
dismiss
from
your
minds
certain
phrases
which
i
am
sorry
to
find
much
in
vogue
amongst
you
i
hear
constantly
of
taking
strong
positions
and
holding
them
of
lines
of
retreat
and
of
bases
of
supplies
let
us
discard
such
ideas
let
us
study
the
probable
line
of
retreat
of
our
opponents
and
leave
our
own
to
take
care
of
themselves
let
us
look

even
the
northern
press
made
sport
of
pope
vein
and
the
confederates
contrasted
his
noisy
declamation
with
the
modesty
of
lee
and
jackson
to
the
south
the
new
commander
was
peculiarly
obnoxious
he
was
the
first
of
the
federal
generals
to
order
that
the
troops
should
subsist
upon
the
country
and
that
the
people
should
be
held
responsible
for
all
damage
done
to
roads
railways
and
telegraphs
by
guerillas
his
orders
it
is
true
were
warranted
by
the
practice
of
war
but
forced
requisitions
unless
conducted
on
a
system
must
inevitably
degenerate
into
plunder
and
oppression
and
pope
in
punishing
civilians
was
not
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
acts
of
guerillas
and
those
of
the
regular
confederate
cavalry
these
orders
says
a
northern
historian
were
followed
by
the
pillaging
of
private
property
and
by
insults
to
females
to
a
degree
unknown
heretofore
during
the
war
but
in
comparison
with
a
third
edict
they
were
mild
and
humane
on
july
pope
generals
were
instructed
to
arrest
every
virginian
within
the
limits
of
their
commands
to
administer
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
union
and
to
expel
from
their
homes
all
those
who
refused
to
take
it
this
order
was
preceded
by
one
from
general
von
steinwehr
a
german
brigadier
directing
the
arrest
of
five
prominent
citizens
to
be
held
as
hostages
and
to
suffer
death
in
the
event
of
any
soldiers
being
shot
by
bushwhackers
the
confederate
government
retaliated
by
declaring
that
pope
and
his
officers
were
not
entitled
to
be
considered
as
soldiers
if
captured
they
were
to
be
imprisoned
so
long
as
their
orders
remained
unrepealed
and
in
the
event
of
any
unarmed
confederate
citizens
being
tried
and
shot
an
equal
number
of
federal
prisoners
were
to
be
hanged
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
the
operations
north
of
gordonsville
were
watched
with
peculiar
interest
by
the
south
this
new
general
it
was
said
to
jackson
claims
your
attention
and
please
god
he
shall
have
it
was
the
reply
nevertheless
with
all
his
peculiar
characteristics
pope
was
no
despicable
foe
the
federal
cavalry
were
employed
with
a
boldness
which
had
not
hitherto
been
seen
their
outposts
were
maintained
twenty
miles
in
advance
of
the
army
frequent
reconnaissances
were
made
a
regiment
of
jackson
cavalry
was
defeated
at
orange
court
house
with
a
loss
of
or
men
and
scouting
parties
penetrated
to
within
a
few
miles
of
gordonsville
even
banks
was
spurred
to
activity
and
learned
at
last
that
information
is
generally
to
be
obtained
if
it
is
resolutely
sought
we
must
constantly
feel
the
enemy
know
where
he
is
and
what
he
is
doing
vigilance
activity
and
a
precaution
that
has
a
considerable
mixture
of
audacity
in
it
will
carry
you
through
many
difficulties
such
were
his
instructions
to
an
officer
of
the
regular
army
it
was
unfortunate
he
had
not
acted
on
those
sound
principles
in
the
valley
very
little
that
occurred
within
the
confederate
lines
escaped
the
vigilance
of
the
enemy
and
although
jackson
numbers
were
somewhat
overestimated
pope
cavalry
energetically
led
by
two
able
young
officers
generals
buford
and
bayard
did
far
better
service
than
detectives
jackson
had
need
of
all
his
prudence
including
the
light
division
his
force
amounted
to
no
more
than
men
and
if
pope
handled
his
whole
army
with
as
much
skill
as
he
used
his
cavalry
it
would
go
hard
with
gordonsville
men
could
hardly
be
expected
to
arrest
the
march
of
unless
the
larger
force
should
blunder
during
the
first
week
in
august
events
began
to
thicken
stuart
made
a
strong
reconnaissance
towards
fredericksburg
and
administered
a
check
to
the
federal
scouting
parties
in
that
quarter
but
mcclellan
threw
forward
a
division
and
occupied
malvern
hill
and
it
became
evident
that
pope
also
was
meditating
a
further
advance
jackson
for
the
purpose
of
luring
him
forward
and
also
of
concealing
hill
arrival
had
drawn
back
his
cavalry
and
moved
his
infantry
south
of
gordonsville
pope
was
warned
from
washington
that
this
was
probably
a
ruse
his
confidence
however
was
not
to
be
shaken
within
ten
days
he
reported
unless
the
enemy
is
heavily
reinforced
from
richmond
i
shall
be
in
possession
of
gordonsville
and
charlottesville
although
such
an
operation
would
carry
pope
far
from
washington
there
was
no
remonstrance
from
headquarters
lincoln
and
stanton
mistrustful
at
last
of
their
ability
as
strategists
had
called
to
their
councils
general
halleck
who
had
shown
some
evidence
of
capacity
while
in
command
of
the
western
armies
the
new
had
a
difficult
problem
to
work
out
it
is
impossible
to
determine
how
far
jackson
movement
to
gordonsville
influenced
the
federal
authorities
but
immediately
on
arrival
at
washington
about
the
same
date
that
the
movement
was
reported
he
was
urged
according
to
his
own
account
to
withdraw
mcclellan
from
the
peninsula
i
delayed
my
decision
he
says
as
long
as
i
dared
delay
it
but
on
august
his
mind
was
made
up
and
mcclellan
just
after
hill
joined
jackson
was
ordered
to
embark
his
army
at
fortress
monroe
sail
to
aquia
creek
near
fredericksburg
and
join
pope
on
the
rappahannock
the
proposed
combination
involving
the
transfer
by
sea
of
men
with
all
their
artillery
and
trains
was
a
manoeuvre
full
of
danger
mcclellan
had
received
no
further
reinforcements
than
those
sent
from
washington
burnside
with
men
remained
at
fortress
monroe
until
the
beginning
of
august
when
he
embarked
for
aquia
creek
concentrating
on
august
hunter
troops
were
withheld
the
retreat
and
embarkation
of
mcclellan
troops
would
take
time
and
the
confederates
possessing
the
interior
lines
had
two
courses
open
to
them
leaving
jackson
to
check
pope
they
might
attack
mcclellan
as
soon
as
he
evacuated
his
intrenched
position
at
harrison
landing
they
might
neglect
mcclellan
and
concentrate
against
pope
before
he
could
be
reinforced
halleck
considered
that
attack
on
mcclellan
was
the
more
likely
and
pope
was
accordingly
instructed
to
threaten
gordonsville
so
as
to
force
lee
to
detach
heavily
from
richmond
and
leave
him
too
weak
to
strike
the
army
of
the
potomac
august
on
august
pope
commenced
his
advance
banks
had
pushed
a
brigade
of
infantry
from
sperryville
to
culpeper
court
house
and
division
of
mcdowell
corps
was
ordered
to
cross
the
rappahannock
at
waterloo
bridge
and
march
to
the
same
spot
jackson
whose
spies
had
informed
him
of
the
enemy
dispositions
received
early
intelligence
of
banks
movement
and
the
next
afternoon
his
three
divisions
were
ordered
forward
marching
by
roads
where
there
was
no
chance
of
their
being
seen
he
hoped
so
he
wrote
to
lee
through
the
blessing
of
providence
to
defeat
the
advanced
federal
detachment
before
reinforcements
should
arrive
this
detachment
was
his
first
objective
but
he
had
long
since
recognised
the
strategic
importance
of
culpeper
court
house
at
this
point
four
roads
meet
and
it
was
probable
from
their
previous
dispositions
that
the
federal
army
corps
would
use
three
of
these
in
their
advance
pope
right
wing
at
sperryville
would
march
by
woodville
and
griffinsburg
his
centre
had
already
moved
forward
from
warrenton
his
left
wing
at
falmouth
north
of
fredericksburg
would
march
by
bealeton
and
brandy
station
or
by
richardsville
and
georgetown
as
all
these
roads
were
several
miles
apart
and
the
lateral
communications
were
indifferent
the
three
columns
during
the
movement
on
culpeper
court
house
would
be
more
or
less
isolated
and
if
the
confederates
could
seize
the
point

to
keep
them
apart
to
prevent

combining

and
to

with
them
in
detail
pope
in
fact
had
embarked
on
a
manoeuvre
which
is
always
dangerous
in
face
of
a
vigilant
and
energetic
enemy
deceived
by
the
passive
attitude
which
jackson
had
hitherto
maintained
and
confident
in
the
strength
of
his
cavalry
which
held
robertson
river
a
stream
some
ten
miles
south
of
culpeper
court
house
he
had
pushed
a
small
force
far
in
advance
and
was
preparing
to
cross
hazel
run
in
several
widely
separated
columns
he
had
no
apprehension
that
he
might
be
attacked
during
the
process
most
generals
in
jackson
situation
confronted
by
far
superior
numbers
would
have
been
content
with
occupying
a
defensive
position
in
front
of
gordonsville
and
neither
pope
nor
halleck
had
gauged
as
yet
the
full
measure
of
their
opponent
enterprise
so
confident
was
the
federal

jackson
force
was
composed
as
follows
jackson

the

jackson
was
by
no
means
displeased
when
he
learned
who
was
in
command
of
the
federal
advance
banks

in

of

he
said
to
mcguire
he
is
always
ready
to
fight
and
then
laughing
he
added
as
if
to
himself
and
he
generally
gets
whipped
the
confederate
regiments
as
a
rule
were
very
weak
the
losses
of
the
seven
days
of
winchester
of
cross
keys
and
of
port
republic
had
not
yet
been
replaced
companies
had
dwindled
down
to
sections
brigades
were
no
stronger
than
full
battalions
and
the
colonel
was
happy
who
could
muster
muskets
but
the
waste
of
the
campaign
was
not
altogether
an
evil
the
weak
and
sickly
had
been
weeded
out
the
had
disappeared
and
if
many
of
the
bravest
had
fallen
before
richmond
those
who
remained
were
hardy
and
experienced
soldiers
the
army
that
lay
round
gordonsville
was
the
best
that
jackson
had
yet
commanded
the
horses
which
had
become
almost
useless
in
the
peninsula
had
soon
regained
condition
on
the
rich
pastures
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
nearly
every
man
had
seen
service
the
officers
were
no
longer
novices
the
troops
had
implicit
confidence
in
their
leaders
and
their
morale
was
high
they
had
not
yet
tasted
defeat
whenever
they
had
met
the
enemy
he
had
abandoned
the
field
of
battle
with
such
troops
much
might
be
risked
and
if
the
staff
was
not
yet
thoroughly
trained
the
district
in
which
they
were
now
operating
was
far
less
intricate
than
the
peninsula
as
the
troops
marched
westward
from
richmond
with
their
faces
towards
their
own
mountains
the
country
grew
more
open
the
horizon
larger
and
the
breezes
purer
the
dark
forests
disappeared
the
clear
streams
running
swiftly
over
rocky
beds
were
a
welcome
change
from
the
swamps
of
the
chickahominy
north
of
gordonsville
the
spurs
of
the
blue
ridge
breaking
up
into
long
chains
of
isolated
hills
towered
high
above
the
sunlit
plains
the
rude
tracks
of
the
peninsula
winding
through
the
woods
gave
place
to
broad
and
highways
nor
did
the
marches
now
depend
upon
the
guidance
of
some
casual
rustic
or
terrified
negro
there
were
many
in
the
confederate
ranks
who
were
familiar
with
the
country
and
the
quick
pencil
of
captain
hotchkiss
jackson
trusted
engineer
who
had
rejoined
from
the
valley
was
once
more
at
his
disposal
information
moreover
was
not
hard
to
come
by
the
country
was
far
more
thickly
populated
than
the
region
about
richmond
and
notwithstanding
pope
harsh
measures
he
was
unable
to
prevent
the
people
communicating
with
their
own
army
if
the
men
had
been
unwilling
to
take
the
risk
the
women
were
quite
ready
to
emulate
the
heroines
of
the
valley
and
the
conduct
of
the
federal
marauders
had
served
only
to
inflame
their
patriotism
under
such
circumstances
jackson
task
was
relieved
of
half
its
difficulties
he
was
almost
as
much
at
home
as
on
the
shenandoah
and
although
there
were
no
massanuttons
to
screen
his
movements
the
hills
to
the
north
insignificant
as
they
might
be
when
compared
with
the
great
mountains
which
divide
the
valley
might
still
be
turned
to
useful
purpose
august
on
august
starting
late
in
the
afternoon
the
confederates
marched
eight
miles
by
a
country
track
and
halted
at
orange
court
house
culpeper
was
still
twenty
miles
distant
and
two
rivers
the
rapidan
and
robertson
barred
the
road
the
robertson
was
held
by
or
federal
cavalry
five
regiments
under
general
buford
were
near
madison
court
house
four
under
general
bayard
near
rapidan
station
east
of
the
railway
two
more
regiments
held
raccoon
ford
others
watched
the
rappahannock
as
far
as
fredericksburg
and
on
thoroughfare
mountain
ten
miles
of
culpeper
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
as
far
as
orange
court
house
was
a
signal
station
august
early
on
the
ewell
division
crossed
the
rapidan
at
liberty
mills
while
the
other
divisions
were
ordered
to
make
the
passage
at
barnett
ford
six
miles
below
a
forced
march
should
have
carried
the
confederates
to
within
striking
distance
of
culpeper
and
a
forced
march
was
almost
imperative
the
cavalry
had
been
in
contact
the
advance
must
already
have
been
reported
to
pope
and
within
hours
the
whole
of
the
federal
army
with
the
exception
of
the
division
at
fredericksburg
might
easily
be
concentrated
in
a
strong
position
still
there
were
no
grounds
for
uneasiness
if
the
troops
made
sixteen
miles
before
nightfall
they
would
be
before
culpeper
soon
after
dawn
and
sixteen
miles
was
no
extraordinary
march
for
the
valley
regiments
but
to
accomplish
a
long
march
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
something
is
demanded
more
than
goodwill
and
endurance
on
the
part
of
the
men
if
the
staff
arrangements
are
faulty
or
the
subordinate
commanders
careless
the
best
troops
in
the
world
will
turn
sluggards
it
was
so
on
august
jackson
soldiers
never
did
a
worse
day
work
during
the
whole
course
of
his
campaigns
even
his
energy
was
powerless
to
push
them
forward
the
heat
indeed
was
excessive
several
men
dropped
dead
in
the
ranks
the
long
columns
dragged
wearily
through
the
dust
and
the
federal
cavalry
was
not
easily
pushed
back
guns
and
infantry
had
to
be
brought
up
before
bayard
dismounted
squadrons
were
dislodged
but
the
real
cause
of
delay
is
to
be
found
elsewhere
not
only
did
general
hill
misunderstand
his
orders
but
apparently
offended
by
reticence
he
showed
but
little
zeal
the
orders
were
certainly
incomplete
nothing
had
been
said
about
the
supply
trains
and
they
were
permitted
to
follow
their
divisions
instead
of
moving
in
rear
of
the
whole
force
ewell
route
moreover
was
changed
without
hill
being
informed
the
lines
of
march
crossed
each
other
and
hill
was
delayed
for
many
hours
by
a
long
column
of
ambulances
and
waggons
so
tedious
was
the
march
that
when
the
troops
halted
for
the
night
ewell
had
made
eight
miles
hill
only
two
and
the
latter
was
still
eighteen
miles
from
culpeper
chagrined
by
the
delay
jackson
reported
to
lee
that
he
had
made
but
little
progress
and
that
the
expedition
he
feared
in
consequence
of
his
tardy
movements
would
be
productive
of
little
good
how
the
blame
should
be
apportioned
it
is
difficult
to
say
jackson
laid
it
upon
hill
and
that
officer
conduct
was
undoubtedly
reprehensible
the
absence
of
major
dabney
struck
down
by
sickness
is
a
possible
explanation
of
the
faulty
orders
but
that
jackson
would
have
done
better
to
have
accepted
lee
hint
to
have
confided
his
intentions
to
his
divisional
commanders
and
to
have
trusted
something
to
their
discretion
seems
more
than
clear
in
war
silence
is
not
invariably
a
wise
policy
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
secrecy
was
the
movement
had
already
been
discovered
by
the
federal
cavalry
and
in
such
circumstances
the
more
officers
that
understood
the
intention
of
the
the
better
men
who
have
been
honoured
with
their
leader
confidence
and
who
grasp
the
purpose
of
the
efforts
they
are
called
upon
to
make
will
if
not
more
cordially
at
least
more
intelligently
than
those
who
are
impelled
by
the
sense
of
duty
alone
as
it
was
so
much
time
had
been
wasted
that
jackson
would
have
been
fully
warranted
in
suspending
the
movement
and
halting
on
the
rapidan
the
federals
were
aware
he
was
advancing
their
divisions
were
not
so
far
apart
that
they
could
not
be
concentrated
within
a
few
hours
at
culpeper
and
in
approaching
so
close
he
was
entering
the
region
of
uncertainty
time
was
too
pressing
to
admit
of
waiting
for
the
reports
of
spies
the
enemy
cavalry
was
far
more
numerous
than
his
own
and
screened
the
troops
in
rear
from
observation
the
information
brought
in
by
the
country
people
was
not
to
be
implicitly
relied
on
their
estimate
of
numbers
was
always
vague
and
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
make
sure
that
the
force
at
culpeper
had
not
been
strongly
reinforced
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
that
the
whole
of
pope
army
might
reach
that
point
in
the
course
of
the
next
day
and
in
that
case
the
confederates
would
be
compelled
to
retreat
followed
by
a
superior
army
across
two
bridgeless
rivers
nevertheless
the
consideration
of
these
contingencies
had
no
effect
on
jackson
purpose
the
odds
he
decided
were
in
his
favour
and
the
defeat
of
pope
army
in
detail
with
all
the
consequences
that
might
follow
was
worth
risking
much
to
bring
about
it
was
still
possible
that
pope
might
delay
his
concentration
it
was
still
possible
that
an
opportunity
might
present
itself
and
as
he
had
done
at
winchester
in
march
when
threatened
by
a
force
sevenfold
stronger
than
his
own
he
resolved
to
look
for
that
opportunity
before
he
renounced
his
enterprise
august
in
speed
and
caution
lay
the
only
chance
of
success
the
start
on
the
was
early
hill
anxious
to
redeem
his
shortcomings
marched
long
before
daylight
and
soon
caught
up
with
ewell
and
winder
half
of
the
cavalry
covered
the
advance
the
remainder
screening
the
left
flank
scouted
west
and
in
the
direction
of
madison
court
house
two
brigades
of
infantry
gregg
and
lawton
were
left
in
rear
to
guard
the
trains
for
the
federal
horsemen
threatened
danger
and
the
army
disembarrassed
of
the
supply
waggons
pressed
forward
across
the
rapidan
pushing
the
federal
cavalry
before
them
the
troops
reached
robertson
river
the
enemy
squadrons
already
worn
out
by
incessant
reconnaissance
and
picket
duty
were
unable
to
dispute
the
passage
and
forming
a
single
column
the
three
divisions
crossed
the
locustdale
ford
climbing
the
northern
bank
the
to
culpeper
white
with
dust
lay
before
them
and
to
their
right
front
little
more
than
two
miles
distant
a
long
wooded
ridge
bearing
the
ominous
name
of
slaughter
mountain
rose
boldly
from
the
plain
ewell
division
led
the
march
and
shortly
before
noon
as
the
troops
swept
past
the
western
base
of
slaughter
mountain
it
was
reported
that
the
federal
cavalry
massed
in
some
strength
had
come
to
a
halt
a
mile
or
two
north
on
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
called
cedar
run
the
confederate
guns
opened
and
the
hostile
cavalry
fell
back
but
from
a
distant
undulation
a
federal
battery
came
into
action
and
the
squadrons
supported
by
this
fire
returned
to
their
old
position
although
cedar
run
was
distant
seven
miles
from
culpeper
it
was
evident
from
the
attitude
of
the
cavalry
that
the
enemy
was
inclined
to
make
a
stand
and
that
in
all
probability
banks
army
corps
was
in
support
this
was
the
case
banks
had
reached
culpeper
on
the
on
the
same
day
his
advanced
brigade
was
sent
forward
to
cedar
run
and
was
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
army
corps
on
the
early
brigade
forming
the
advanced
guard
which
had
halted
in
a
wood
by
the
roadside
was
now
ordered
forward
deploying
to
the
right
of
the
highway
it
drove
in
the
enemy
vedettes
and
came
out
on
the
open
ground
which
overlooks
the
stream
across
the
shallow
valley
covered
with
the
high
stalks
and
broad
leaves
of
indian
corn
rose
a
loftier
ridge
twelve
hundred
yards
distant
and
from
more
than
one
point
batteries
opened
on
the
confederate
scouts
the
regiments
of
the
advanced
guard
were
immediately
withdrawn
to
the
reverse
slope
of
the
ridge
and
jackson
galloped
forward
to
the
mound
of
the
guns
his
dispositions
had
been
quickly
made
a
large
force
of
artillery
was
ordered
to
come
into
action
on
either
flank
of
the
advanced
guard
ewell
division
was
ordered
to
the
right
taking
post
on
the
northern
face
of
slaughter
mountain
winder
was
ordered
to
the
left
and
hill
as
soon
as
he
came
up
was
to
form
the
reserve
in
rear
of
winder
these
movements
took
time
the
confederate
column
infantry
and
fifteen
batteries
must
have
occupied
more
than
seven
miles
of
road
it
would
consequently
take
over
two
hours
for
the
whole
force
to
deploy
for
battle
before
three
however
the
first
line
was
formed
on
the
right
of
the
advanced
guard
near
a
clump
of
cedars
were
eight
guns
and
on
slaughter
mountain
eight
more
along
the
to
the
left
six
guns
of
winder
division
were
soon
afterwards
deployed
reinforced
by
four
of
hill
these
pieces
nearly
the
whole
of
the
ordnance
which
the
confederates
possessed
were
turned
on
the
opposing
batteries
and
for
nearly
two
hours
the
artillery
thundered
across
the
valley
the
infantry
meanwhile
awaiting
hill
arrival
had
come
into
line
ewell
brigades
trimble
and
the
louisianians
commanded
by
colonel
forno
had
halted
in
the
woods
on
the
extreme
right
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
threatening
the
enemy
flank
winder
had
come
up
on
the
left
and
had
posted
the
stonewall
brigade
in
rear
of
his
guns
campbell
brigade
under
garnett
was
stationed
in
front
west
and
taliaferro
brigade
east
of
the
road
the
men
of
the
light
division
however
were
still
some
distance
to
the
rear
and
the
position
was
hardly
secure
against
a
counterstroke
the
left
of
the
line
extended
along
a
skirt
of
woodland
which
ran
at
right
angles
to
the
road
overlooking
a

lately
reaped
on
the
further
side
of
which
and
three
hundred
yards
distant
was
dense
wood
this
point
was
the
most
vulnerable
for
there
was
no
support
at
hand
and
a
great
tract
of
forest
stretched
away
westward
where
cavalry
was
useless
but
through
which
it
was
quite
possible
that
infantry
might
force
its
way
jackson
ordered
colonel
garnett
commanding
the
brigade
on
this
flank
to
look
well
to
his
left
and
to
ask
his
divisional
commander
for
reinforcements
the
brigadier
sent
a
staff
officer
and
an
orderly
to
reconnoitre
the
forest
to
the
left
and
two
officers
were
dispatched
to
secure
the
support
but
at
this
juncture
general
winder
was
mortally
wounded
by
a
shell
there
was
some
delay
in
issuing
orders
and
before
the
weak
place
in
the
line
could
be
strengthened
the
storm
broke
the
batteries
five
in
number
although
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
confederates
had
compelled
them
to
change
position
had
not
yet
been
silenced
no
large
force
of
federal
infantry
had
as
yet
appeared
skirmishers
only
had
pushed
forward
through
the
corn
but
the
presence
of
so
many
guns
was
a
clear
indication
that
a
strong
force
was
not
far
off
and
jackson
had
no
intention
of
attacking
a
position
which
had
not
yet
been
reconnoitred
until
his
rear
division
had
closed
up
and
the
hostile
artillery
had
lost
its
sting

within

at
the

where
jackson
had
advised
precaution
the
line
of
defence
was
broken
through
on
the
edge
of
the
timber
commanding
the
wheatfield
only
two
confederate
regiments
were
posted
some
men
all
told

the

on
the

was
completely

the

behind

it

in

of

and
hidden
from

the

the

in

assailed
in
front
from
the
field
and
in
flank
from
the
forest
the
men
would
stand
no
longer
and
flying
back
through
the
woodland
left
the
way
open
to
the
very
rear
of
the
position
the
virginia
outflanked
in
turn
was
compelled
to
give
ground
and
the
federals
without
waiting
to
reform
swept
rapidly
through
the
wood
and
bore
down
upon
the
flank
of
taliaferro
brigade
and
winder
batteries
and
now
occurred
a
scene
of
terrible
confusion
so
swift
was
the
onslaught
that
the
first
warning
received
by
the
confederates
on
the
highroad
was
a
sudden
storm
of
musketry
the
loud
cheers
of
the
enemy
and
the
rush
of
fugitives
from
the
forest
attacked
simultaneously
in
front
flank
and
rear
with
the
guns
and
limbers
entangled
among
the
infantry
winder
division
was
subjected
to
an
ordeal
of
which
it
was
without
experience
the
batteries
by
jackson
order
were
at
once
withdrawn
and
not
a
gun
was
lost
the
infantry
however
did
not
escape
so
lightly
the
federals
emboldened
by
the
flight
of
the
artillery
charged
forward
with
reckless
courage
every
regimental
commander
in
garnett
brigade
was
either
killed
or
wounded
taliaferro
brigade
was
driven
back
and
early
left
was
broken
some
regiments
attempted
to
change
front
others
retreated
in
disorder
scattered
groups
plying
butt
and
bayonet

to
stay
the
rout
officers
rushed
into
the
mêlée
and
called
upon
those
at
hand
to
follow
men
were
captured
and
recaptured
and
for
a
few
moments
the
blue
and
grey
were
mingled
in
close
conflict
amid
the
smoke
but
the
isolated
efforts
of
the
confederates
were
of
no
avail
the
first
line
was
irretrievably
broken
the
troops
were
mingled
in
a
tumultuous
mass
through
which
the
shells
tore
shrieking
the
enemy
bayonets
were
surging
forward
on
every
side
and
his
batteries
firing
over
the
heads
of
their
own
infantry
played
heavily
on
the
road
but
fortunately
for
the
virginians
the
federal
right
wing
was
unsupported
and
although
the
light
division
was
still
at
some
distance
from
the
field
the
stonewall
brigade
was
already
advancing
breaking
through
the
rout
to
the
left
of
the
highroad
these
five
staunch
regiments
undismayed
by
the
disaster
opened
a
heavy
fire
the
federals
although
still
superior
in
numbers
at
the
decisive
point
had
lost
all
order
in
their
successful
charge
to
meet
this
fresh
onset
they
halted
and
drew
together
and
then
jackson
with
wonderful
energy
restored
the
battle
sending
orders
for
ewell
and
hill
to
attack
at
once
he
galloped
forward
unattended
by
either
staff
officer
or
orderly
and
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
own
men
his
soldiers
of
the
valley
no
longer
presenting
the
stubborn
front
of
bull
run
or
kernstown
but
an
ungovernable
mob
breaking
rapidly
to
the
rear
and
on
the
very
verge
of
panic
drawing
his
sword
for
the
first
time
in
the
war
his
voice
pealed
high
above
the
din
the
troops
caught
the
familiar
accents
instinct
with
resolution
and
the
presence
of
their
own
general
acted
like
a
spell
rally
men
he
shouted
and
follow
me
taliaferro
riding
up
to
him
emphatically
insisted
that
the
midst
of
the
mêlée
was
no
place
for
the
leader
of
an
army
he
looked
a
little
surprised
but
with
his
invariable
ejaculation
of
good
good
turned
slowly
to
the
rear
the
impulse
however
had
already
been
given
to
the
confederate
troops
with
a
wild
yell
the
remnant
of
the
virginia
rushed
forward
to
the
front
and
received
the
pursuers
with
a
sudden
volley
the
officers
of
other
regiments
inspired
by
the
example
of
their
commander
bore
the
colours
forward

but
on
the
left
the
mass
of
fresh

directed
on
the
critical
point

a
decisive
influence

in

quarter
of

up

slopes

witness
to
the
severity
of
the
fighting
the
slaughter
had
been
very
heavy
within
ninety
minutes
men
had
fallen
the

were
a
shambles
and
among
the
corn
the
dead
lay
thick
scores
of
prisoners
surrendered
themselves
and
hundreds
of
discarded
muskets
bore
witness
to
the
demoralisation
of
the
northerners
nevertheless
the
pursuit
was
slow
the
impetuosity
of
the
confederates
eager
to
complete
their
triumph
was
checked
with
a
firm
hand
the
infantry
were
ordered
to
reform
before
they
entered
the
dense
forest
which
lay
between
them
and
culpeper
the

were

forward
as

although
jackson
had
been
careful
to
bring
guides
who
knew
the
woodland
tracks
there
was
need
for
prudence
the
light
was
failing
the
cavalry
could
find
no
space
to
act
and
above
all
the
whereabouts
of
pope
main
body
was
still
uncertain
the
federals
had
fought
with
fine
courage
their
resolute
attack
pressed
home
with
extraordinary
dash
had
rolled
up
the
choicest
of
the
valley
regiments
and
yet
it
was
evident
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
northern
army
had
been
engaged
the
stirring
incidents
of
the
battle
had
been
crowded
into
a
short
space
of
time
it
was
five
when
the
federals
left
their
covert
an
hour
and
a
half
later
they
had
abandoned
the
field
their
precipitate
retreat
the
absence
of
a
strong
were
sure
tokens
that
every
regiment
had
been
employed
in
the
attack
and
it
was
soon
discovered
by
the
confederate
soldiers
that
these
regiments
were
old
opponents
of
the
valley
army
the
men
who
had
surprised
and
outflanked
jackson
old
division
were
the
same
men
that
had
been
surprised
at
front
royal
and
outflanked
at
winchester
but

corps
formed
only
a
third
part
of

army
sigel
and
mcdowell
were
still
to
be
accounted
for
it
was
possible
however
that
no
more
formidable
enemies
than
the
troops
already
defeated
would
be
found
between
cedar

seven
miles
that

between

only
had
been
passed
when
the
scouts
brought
information
that
the
enemy
was
in
position
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
front
a
battery
was
immediately
sent
forward
to
develop
the
situation
the
moon
was
full
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
glade
where
the
advanced
guard
acting
under
orders
had
halted
and
deployed
a
strong
line
of
fire
marked
the
hostile
front
once
more
the
woodland
avenues
reverberated
to
the
crash
of
musketry
and
when
the
guns
opened
a
portion
of
the
federal
line
was
seen
flying
in
disorder
pope
himself
had
arrived
upon
the
scene
but
surprised
by
the
sudden
salvo
of
jackson
guns
he
was
constrained
to
do
what
he
had
never
done
in
the
west
to
turn
his
back
upon
the
enemy
and
seek
a
safer
position
yet
despite
the
disappearance
of
the
staff
the
union
artillery
made
a
vigorous
reply
two
batteries
hidden
by
the
timber
concentrated
on
the
four
guns
of
the
advanced
guard
and
about
the
same
moment
the
confederate
cavalry
on
the
extreme
right
reported
that
they
had
captured
prisoners
belonging
to
sigel
army
corps
believing
it
imprudent
says
jackson
to
continue
to
move
forward
during
the
darkness
i
ordered
a
halt
for
the
night
august
further
information
appears
to
have
come
to
hand
after
midnight
and
early
the
next
morning
general
stuart
who
had
arrived
on
a
tour
of
inspection
having
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
cavalry
ascertained
beyond
all
question
that
the
greater
part
of
pope
army
had
come
up
the
confederates
were
ordered
to
withdraw
and
before
noon
nearly
the
whole
force
had
regained
their
old
position
on
cedar
run
they
were
not
followed
save
by
the
federal
cavalry
and
for
two
days
they
remained
in
position
ready
to
receive
attack
the
enemy
however
gave
no
sign
of
aggressive
intentions
august
on
the
morning
of
the
a
flag
of
truce
was
received
and
pope
was
permitted
to
bury
the
dead
which
had
not
already
been
interred
the
same
night
his
wounded
his
prisoners
and
the
captured
arms
having
already
been
removed
jackson
returned
to
his
old
camps
near
gordonsville
august
his
position
on
cedar
run
tactically
strong
was
strategically
unsound
the
intelligence
he
had
obtained
was
substantially
correct
with
the
exception
of
five
regiments
of
mcdowell
cavalry
only
banks
army
corps
had
been
engaged
at
cedar
run
but
during
the
evening
both
sigel
and
mcdowell
had
reached
the
field
and
it
was
their
troops
which
had
checked
the
confederate
pursuit
in
fact
on
the
morning
of
the
pope
besides
cavalry
had
fresh
troops
in
addition
to
those
which
had
been
defeated
and
which
he
estimated
at
effectives
wherewith
to
bar
the
way
to
culpeper
mcdowell
second
division
strong
on
the
march
from
fredericksburg
was
not
more
than
twenty
mites
east
of
slaughter
mountain
in
front
therefore
jackson
was
confronted
by
superior
numbers
at
the
least
estimate
men
were
posted
beyond
cedar
run
and
under
king
were
coming
up
from
fredericksburg
nor
was
a
preponderance
of
numbers
the
only
obstacle
with
which
jackson
had
to
deal
a
direct
attack
on
pope
was
impossible
but
a
turning
movement
by
way
of
james
city
might
have
found
him
unprepared
or
a
swift
advance
might
have
crushed
king
but
for
the
execution
of
either
manoeuvre
a
large
force
of
cavalry
was
absolutely
essential
by
this
means
alone
could
the
march
be
concealed
and
a
surprise
effected
in
view
however
of
the
superior
strength
of
the
federal
horsemen
such
a
project
was
unfeasible
and
retreat
was
manifestly
the
only
alternative
nevertheless
it
was
not
till
he
was
assured
that
no
further
opportunity
would
be
given
him
that
jackson
evacuated
his
position
for
two
days
he
remained
on
cedar
run
within
two
miles
of
the
federal
outposts
defying
his
enemy
to
battle
if
an
attack
on
the
federals
promised
nothing
but
defeat
it
was
not
so
sure
that
pope
with
infantry
of
whom
a
considerable
number
had
just
tasted
defeat
would
be
able
to
oust
jackson
with
from
a
position
which
the
latter
had
selected
and
it
was
not
till
approach
gave
the
federals
an
overwhelming
superiority
that
the
confederates
withdrew
behind
the
rapidan
with
sublime
audacity
as
soon
as
his
enemy
had
disappeared
pope
claimed
the
battle
of
cedar
run
as
a
federal
success
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
he
ventured
to
forecast
the
future
it
is
safe
to
predict
he
declared
in
a
general
order
that
this
is
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
victories
which
shall
make
the
army
of
virginia
famous
in
the
land
that
such
language
however
was
the
natural
result
of
intense
relief
at
jackson
retreat
may
be
inferred
from
his
telegrams
which
unfortunately
for
his
reputation
have
been
preserved
in
the
archives
of
washington
nor
was
his
attitude
on
the
and
that
of
a
victorious
commander
for
two
days
he
never
stirred
from
his
position
he
informed
halleck
that
the
enemy
was
in
very
superior
force
that
stuart
and
longstreet
had
joined
jackson
and
while
the
confederates
were
withdrawing
he
was
telegraphing
that
he
would
certainly
be
attacked
the
next
morning
halleck
reply
to
pope
final
dispatch
which

they

broken

of
the
best

the

their
most
famous
leader
and
if
they
had
been
overwhelmed
by
numbers
they
had
at

fought

jackson
himself
bore
witness
to
the
vigour
of
their
onslaught
to
their
temporary
triumph
and
to
the
impetuous
valour
of
their
cavalry
the
federal
defeat
was
more
honourable
than
many
victories
but
that
it
was
a
crushing
defeat
can
hardly
be
disputed
the
two
divisions
which
had
been
engaged
were
completely
shattered
and
pope
reported
that
they
were
no
longer
fit
for

the
casualties
amongst
the
infantry
amounted
to
a

of

the

was
hardly
to
be
tamed
by
such
punishment
as
this
nevertheless
northern
historians
have
not
hesitated
to
rank
cedar
run
as
a
battle
unfavourable
to
the
confederates
swinton
declares
that
jackson
undertook
the
pursuit
of
banks
under
the
impression
that
he
had
gained
a
victory
i
may
here
express
my
regret
that
in
the
first
edition
i
should
have
classed
ropes
amongst
the
adverse
critics
of
jackson
operations
at
this
period
how
i
came
to
fall
into
the
error
i
can
not
explain
i
should
certainly
have
remembered
that
ropes
writings
are
distinguished
as
much
by
impartiality
as
by
ability
southern
writers
on
the
other
hand
have
classed
cedar
run
amongst
the
most
brilliant
achievements
of
the
war
and
an
unbiassed
investigation
goes
far
to
support
their
view
during
the
first
week
in
august
jackson
protecting
the
virginia
central
railroad
was
confronted
by
a
much
superior
force
he
could
expect
no
further
reinforcements
for
mcclellan
was
still
near
richmond
and
according
to
the
latest
information
was
actually
advancing
on
the
he
heard
that
pope
also
was
moving
forward
from
hazel
run
and
had
pushed
a
portion
of
his
army
as
far
as
culpeper
in
face
of
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
federal
cavalry
it
was
impossible
if
he
occupied
a
defensive
position
that
he
could
protect
the
railroad
for
while
their
infantry
and
artillery
held
him
in
front
their
swarming
squadrons
would
operate
at
their
leisure
on
either
flank
nor
could
a
defensive
position
have
been
long
maintained
there
were
no
natural
obstacles
neither
river
nor
mountains
to
protect
jackson
flanks
and
the
railroad
his
line
of
supply
would
have
been
parallel
to
his
front
in
a
vigorous
offensive
then
should
opportunity
offer
lay
his
best
chance
of
success
that
opportunity
was
offered
by
the
unsupported
advance
of
the
federal
detachment
under
banks
it
is
true
that
jackson
hoped
to
achieve
more
than
the
defeat
of
this
comparatively
small
force
if
he
could
have
seized
culpeper
he
might
have
been
able
to
deal
with
pope
army
in
detail
he
saw
before
him
another
valley
campaign
and
he
was
fully
justified
in
believing
that
victory
on
the
rapidan
would
bring
mcclellan
back
to
washington
his
anticipations
were
not
altogether
realised
he
crushed
the
detachment
immediately
opposed
to
him
but
he
failed
to
seize
culpeper
and
mcclellan
had
already
been
ordered
although
this
was
unknown
to
the
confederates
to
evacuate
the
peninsula
but
it
can
not
be
fairly
said
that
his
enterprise
was
therefore
useless
strategically
it
was
a
fine
conception
the
audacity
of
his
manoeuvre
was
not
the
least
of
its
merits
for
an
army
of
men
weak
in
cavalry
to
advance
against
an
army
of
including
horsemen
was
the
very
height
of
daring
but
it
was
the
daring
of
profound
calculation
as
it
was
jackson
ran
little
risk
he
succeeded
in
his
immediate
object
he
crushed
pope
advanced
guard
and
he
retreated
unmolested
bearing
with
him
the
prisoners
the
colours
and
the
arms
which
he
had
captured
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
occupying
culpeper
it
was
not
his
fault
fortune
was
against
him
on
the
very
day
that
he
had
moved
forward
pope
had
done
the
same
banks
and
mcdowell
were
at
culpeper
on
the
and
sigel
received
orders
to
move
the
same
day
nevertheless
the
expedition
was
far
from
barren
in
result
if
jackson
failed
to
defeat
pope
altogether
he
at
least
singed
his
beard
it
was
well
worth
the
loss
of
men
to
have
destroyed
two
whole
divisions
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
general
commanding
a
superior
army
a
few
days
later
pope
was
to
feel
the
want
of
these
gallant
regiments
so
late
as
august
pope
reported
that
banks
troops
were
much
demoralised
volume
part
page
and
the
confidence
of
his
troops
in
their
commander
was
much
shaken
moreover
the
blow
was
felt
at
washington
there
was
no
more
talk
of
occupying
gordonsville
pope
was
still
full
of
ardour
but
halleck
forbade
him
to
advance
further
than
the
rapidan
where
burnside
would
reinforce
him
and
mcclellan
was
ordered
to
hasten
the
departure
of
his
troops
from
the
peninsula
jackson
tactics
have
been
criticised
as
severely
as
his
strategy
because
his
first
line
was
broken
it
is
asserted
that
he
narrowly
escaped
a
serious
defeat
and
that
had
the
two
forces
been
equally
matched
banks
would
have
won
a
decisive
victory
this
is
hardly
sound
criticism
in
the
first
place
jackson
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
the
two
forces
were
not
equally
matched
if
he
had
had
no
more
men
than
banks
would
he
have
disposed
his
forces
as
he
did
he
would
scarcely
have
occupied
the
same
extent
of
ground
with
men
that
he
did
with
his
actual
front
when
banks
attacked
was
two
miles
long
with
smaller
numbers
he
would
have
occupied
a
smaller
front
and
would
have
retained
a
sufficient
force
in
reserve
in
the
second
place
it
is
generally
possible
for
an
inferior
force
if
it
puts
every
man
into
the
to
win
some
measure
of
success
but
such
success
as
was
shown
at
kernstown
can
seldom
be
more
than
temporary
and
if
the
enemy
makes
good
use
of
his
reserves
must
end
in
defeat
so
far
from
jackson
tactics
being
indifferent
it
is
very
easy
to
show
that
they
were
exactly
the
contrary
immediately
he
came
upon
the
field
he
sent
ewell
to
occupy
slaughter
mountain
a
mile
distant
from
his
line
of
march
and
the
huge
hill
with
batteries
planted
on
its
commanding
terraces
not
only
secured
his
flank
but
formed
a
strong
pivot
for
his
attack
on
the
federal
right
the
preliminary
operations
were
conducted
with
due
deliberation
there
was
no
rushing
forward
to
the
attack
while
the
enemy
strength
was
still
uncertain
the
ridge
occupied
by
the
enemy
so
far
as
possible
was
thoroughly
reconnoitred
and
every
rifled
gun
was
at
once
brought
up
the
artillery
positions
were
well
selected
for
notwithstanding
their
superiority
of
ordnance
the
federal
batteries
suffered
far
more
heavily
than
the
confederates
the
one
weak
point
was
the
extreme
left
and
to
this
point
jackson
in
person
directed
the
attention
of
his
subordinates
had
reinforcements
says
colonel
garnett
who
commanded
the
troops
that
first
gave
way
momentarily
expected
arrived
ten
minutes
sooner
no
disaster
would
have
happened
volume
part
page
that
the
point
was
not
strengthened
that
the
stonewall
brigade
was
not
posted
in
second
line
behind
the
virginia
and
that
only
a
staff
officer
and
an
orderly
were
sent
to
patrol
the
forest
to
the
westward
instead
of
several
companies
of
infantry
was
in
no
way
due
to
the
nor
was
the
position
of
hill
division
which
in
conjunction
with
the
stonewall
brigade
averted
the
disaster
and
won
the
victory
a
fortuitous
circumstance
before
the
attack
began
it
had
been
directed
to
this
point
and
the
strong
counterstroke
which
was
made
by
these
fresh
troops
was
exactly
the
manoeuvre
which
the
situation
demanded
at
the
time
it
was
ordered
the
confederate
left
and
centre
were
hard
pressed
the
stonewall
brigade
had
checked
the
troops
which
had
issued
from
the
forest
but
the
whole
confederate
line
was
shaken
the
normal
though
less
brilliant
course
would
have
been
to
have
the
front
and
not
till
that
had
been
done
to
have
ventured
on
the
jackson
with
that
quick
intuition
which
is
possessed
by
few
saw
and
seized
his
opportunity
while
the
federals
were
still
pressing
the
attack
one
of
brigades
was
sent
to
support
the
centre
and
almost
in
the
same
breath
six
others
a
mass
of
or
men
were
ordered
to
attack
the
enemy
right
to
outflank
it
and
to
roll
back
his
whole
line
upon
ewell
who
was
instructed
at
the
same
moment
to
outflank
the
left
notwithstanding
some
delay
in
execution
ewell
inability
to
advance
and
the
charge
of
the
federal
cavalry
this
vigorous
blow
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
the
battle
within
a
short
conceived
in
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
wild
excitement
and
fierce
tumult
delivered
with
all
the
strength
available
it
can
not
be
judged
otherwise
than
as
the
mark
of
a
great
captain
few
battles
indeed
bear
the
impress
of
a
single
personality
more
clearly
than
cedar
run
from
the
first
of
the
advanced
guard
until
the
last
volley
in
the
midnight
forest
one
will
directed
every
movement
the
field
was
no
small
one
the
fight
was
full
of
startling
changes
it
was
no
methodical
conflict
but
a
fierce
struggle
at
close
quarters
the
lines
swaying
to
and
fro
and
the
ground
covered
with
confused
masses
of
men
and
guns
with
flying
batteries
and
broken
regiments
but
the
turmoil
of
battle
found
a
master
the
strong
brain
was
never
clearer
than
when
the
storm
raged
most
fiercely
wherever
his
presence
was
most
needed
there
jackson
was
seen
rallying
the
fugitives
reinforcing
the
centre
directing
the
counterstroke
and
leading
the
pursuit
and
he
was
well
supported
his
subordinate
generals
carried
out
their
orders
to
the
letter
but
every
order
which
bore
upon
the
issue
of
the
battle
came
from
the
lips
of
one
man
if
northern
writers
have
overlooked
the
skill
with
which
jackson
controlled
the
fight
they
have
at
the
same
time
misunderstood
his
action
two
days
later
his
retreat
to
gordonsville
has
been
represented
as
a
flight
he
is
said
to
have
abandoned
many
wounded
and
stragglers
and
to
have
barely
saved
his
baggage
in
all
this
there
is
not
one
word
of
truth
we
have
indeed
the
report
of
the
federal
officer
who
conducted
the
pursuit
the
flight
of
the
enemy
after
saturday
fight
was
most
precipitate
and
in
great
confusion
his
old
camp
was
strewn
with
dead
men
horses
and
arms
a
good
many
federal
prisoners
wounded
in
saturday
fight
were
found
almost
abandoned
major
andrews
chief
of
artillery
to
general
jackson
was
found
badly
wounded
at
crooked
run
in
charge
of
an
assistant
surgeon
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
general
buford
the
officer
thus
reporting
had
not
been
present
at
the
battle
he
had
been
out
off
with
his
four
regiments
by
the
advance
of
the
confederate
cavalry
and
had
retired
on
sperryville
he
may
accordingly
be
excused
for
imagining
that
a
retreat
which
had
been
postponed
for
two
days
was
precipitate
but
dead
men
dead
horses
and
old
arms
which
the
confederates
had
probably
exchanged
for
those
which
were
captured
several
wounded
federals
who
had
been
prisoners
in
the
enemy
hands
and
one
wounded
confederate
a
major
of
and
not
a
staff
officer
at
all
are
hardly
evidences
of
undue
haste
or
great
confusion
moreover
in
the
list
of
confederate
casualties
only
men
were
put
down
as
missing
it
is
true
that
jackson
need
not
have
retreated
so
far
as
gordonsville
he
might
have
halted
behind
the
rapidan
where
the
bluffs
on
the
south
bank
overlook
the
level
country
to
the
north
but
jackson
manoeuvres
whether
in
advance
or
retreat
were
invariably
actuated
by
some
definite
purpose
and
what
that
purpose
was
he
explains
in
his
dispatches
volume
part
page
i
remained
in
position
until
the
night
of
the
when
i
returned
to
the
vicinity
of
gordonsville
in
order
to
avoid
being
attacked
by
the
vastly
superior
force
in
front
of
me
and
with
the
hope
that
by
thus
falling
back
general
pope
would
be
induced
to
follow
me
until
i
should
be
reinforced
that
pope
had
he
been
left
to
his
own
judgment
would
have
crossed

rapidan
is
certain
the
enemy
he
reported
has
retreated
to
gordonsville
i
shall
move
forward

soon
as

arrives

restrained

more
wary

how
wise
was
this
warning
and
what
would
have
been
the
fate
of
pope
had
he
recklessly
crossed
the
rapidan
the
next
chapter

reveal
chapter
groveton
and
the
second
manassas
during
the
summer
of
the
stirring
events
in
the
western
hemisphere
attracted
universal
attention
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
richmond
the
fierce
fighting
on
the
chickahominy
and
the
defeat
of
the
invaders
excited
europe
hardly
less
than
it
did
the
north
the
weekly
mails
were
eagerly
awaited
the
newspapers
devoted
many
columns
to
narrative
criticism
and
prediction
the
strategy
and
tactics
of
the
rival
armies
were
everywhere
discussed
and
the
fact
that
almost
every
single
item
of
intelligence
came
from
a
northern
source
served
only
as
a
whet
to
curiosity
the
vast
territory
controlled
by
the
confederacy
was
so
completely
cut
off
from
the
outer
world
that
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
enveloped
the
efforts
of
the
defence
the
southern
states
it
has
been
said
stood
in
the
attitude
of
a
beleaguered
fortress
the
war
was
in
truth
a
great
siege
the
fortress
covered
an
area
of
more
than
square
miles
and
the
lines
of
investment
around
it
extended
over
more
than
miles
within
the
circle
of
federal
cannon
and
federal
cruisers
only
the
imagination
could
penetrate
at
rare
intervals
some
daring
brought
a
budget
of
southern
newspapers
or
an
enterprising
correspondent
succeeded
in
transmitting
a
dispatch
from
richmond
but
such
glimpses
of
the
situation
within
the
cordon
did
little
more
than
tantalise
the
news
was
generally
belated
and
had
often
been
long
discounted
by
more
recent
events
still
from
northern
sources
alone
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
the
weaker
of
the
two
belligerents
was
making
a
splendid
struggle
great
names
and
great
achievements
loomed
large
through
the
darkness
the
war
at
the
outset
waged
by
and
volunteers
commanded
by
officers
unknown
to
fame
had
attracted
small
notice
from
professional
soldiers
after
the
seven
days
battles
it
assumed
a
new
aspect
the
men
despite
their
shortcomings
had
displayed
undeniable
courage
and
the
strategy
which
had
relieved
richmond
recalled
the
of
napoleon
it
was
evident
that
the
southern
army
was
led
by
men
of
brilliant
ability
and
the
names
of
lee
lieutenants
were
on
every
tongue
foremost
amongst
these
was
stonewall
jackson
even
the
northern
newspapers
made
no
scruple
of
expressing
their
admiration
and
the
dispatches

what
did
this

portend
whither

the

betaken
himself
where
would
the
next
blow
fall
i
like
jackson
movements
wrote
mcclellan
to

he
will
suddenly
appear
when
least
expected
this
misgiving
found
many
echoes
while
jackson
was
operating
against

successfully
completed
the
evacuation
of

embarking

marched
his

observed
by

otherwise
unmolested

the

for
some
days
not

jackson
had
completely
vanished
but
the
silence
at
the
front
was
not
considered
a
reassuring
symptom
if
the
confederates
had
allowed
mcclellan
to
escape
it
was
very
generally
felt
that
they
had
done
so
only
because
they
were
preparing
to
crush
pope
before
he
could
be
reinforced
it
is
the
fear
of
this
operation
wrote
the
times
special
correspondent
in
the
northern
states
conducted
by
the
redoubtable
stonewall
jackson
that

filled

ardently

the
times
september
neither
the
knowledge
which
mcclellan
possessed
of
his
old
west
point
comrade
nor
the
instinct
of
the
financiers
proved
misleading
jackson
had
already
made
his
plans
even
before
he
had
lured
pope
forward
to
the
rapidan
he
had
begun
to
plot
his
downfall
when
we
were
marching
back
from
cedar
run
writes
major
hotchkiss

had
passed
orange
court
house
on
our
way
to
gordonsville
the
general
who
was
riding
in
front
of
the
staff
beckoned
me
to
his
aide
he
at
once
entered
into
conversation
and
said
that
as
soon
as
we
got
back
to
camp
he
wished
me
to
prepare
maps
of
the
whole
country
between
gordonsville
and
washington
adding
that
he
required
several
copies
i
think
five
august
this
was
about
noon
on
sunday
and
as
we
were
near
camp
i
asked
him
if
the
map
was
to
be
begun
immediately
knowing
his
great
antipathy
to
doing
anything
on
sunday
which
was
not
a
work
of
necessity
he
replied
that
it
was
important
to
have
it
done
at
once
letter
to
the
author
august
the
next
day
august
the
exact
position
of
the
federal
army
was
ascertained
the
camps
were
north
and
east
of
slaughter
mountain
and
jackson
instructed
captain
boswell
his
chief
engineer
who
had
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
to
report
on
the
best
means
of
turning
the
enemy
left
flank
and
reaching
warrenton
thus
intervening
between
pope
and
washington
or
between
pope
and

by

the
night

there
halted
to
await
reinforcements
these

on
the
general

learned
that
burnside
who
had
already
left
the
peninsula
for
aquia
creek
on
the
potomac
was
preparing
to
join
pope
and
it
was
reported
by
a
deserter
that
part
of
mcclellan
army
had
embarked
on
the
transports
at
harrison
landing
inferring
that
the
enemy
had
relinquished
all
active
operations
in
the
peninsula
and
that
pope
would
soon
be
reinforced
by
the
army

lee
resolved
to
take
the
offensive
without
delay
the
campaign
which
jackson
had
suggested
more
than
a
month
before
when
mcclellan
was
still
reeling
under
the
effects
of
his
defeat
and
pope

was
not

its
tranquil
beauty
nor

august
on
the
afternoon
of
august
pope
forces
seemed
doomed
to
inevitable
destruction
the
confederate
army
ready
to
advance
the
next
morning
was
concentrated
behind
clark
mountain
and
lee
and
jackson
looking
toward
culpeper
saw
the
promise
of
victory
in
the
careless
attitude
of
the
enemy
the
day
was
hot
and
still
round
the
base
of
slaughter
mountain
fifteen
miles
northward
clustered
many
thousands
of
tents
and
the
blue
smoke
of
the
rose
straight
and
thin
in
the
sultry
air
regiments
of
infantry
just
discernible
through
the
glare
were
marching
and
countermarching
in
various
directions
and
long
were
creeping
slowly
along
the
dusty
roads
near
at
hand
rising
above
the
the
union
colours
showed
that
the
outposts
still
held
the
river
and
the
flash
of
steel
at
the
end
of
some
woodland
vista
betrayed
the
presence
of
scouting
party
or
vedette
but
there
were
no
symptoms
of
unusual
excitement
no
sign
of
working
parties
of
reinforcements
for
the
advanced
posts
of
the
construction
of
earthworks
or
abattis
camps
were
scattered
over
a
wide
tract
of
country
his
cavalry
was
idle
and
it
seemed
absolutely
certain
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
confederate
army
the
inference
was
correct
the
march
to
pisgah
church
had
escaped
notice
the
federals
were
unaware
that
lee
had
arrived
at
gordonsville
and
they
had
as
yet
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
the
smallest
danger
of
attack
between
raccoon
and
locustdale
fords
and
stretching
back
to
culpeper
court
house
men
for
reno
with
two
divisions
of
army
strong
had
arrived
from
fredericksburg
were
in
camp
and
bivouac
the
front
was
protected
by
a
river
nearly
a
hundred
yards
wide
of
which
every
crossing
was
held
by
a
detachment
and
pope
had
reported
that
his
position
was
so
strong
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
drive
him
from
it
but
he
had
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
the
energy
and
ability
of
the
confederate
leaders
his
situation
in
reality
was
one
of
extreme
danger
in
ordering
pope
to
the
rapidan
and
bidding
him
fight
like
the
volume
part
page
it
may
have
been
fortunate
for
the
confederates
says
longstreet
that
he
was
not
instructed
to
fight
like
jackson
until
mcclellan
should
come
up
halleck
made
the
same
fatal
error
as
stanton
when
he
sent
shields
up
the
luray
valley
in
pursuit
of
jackson
he
had
put
an
inferior
force
within
reach
of
an
enemy
who
held
the
interior
lines
and
had
ordered
two
armies
separated
by
several
marches
to
effect
their
concentration
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
guns
and
if
pope
strategical
position
was
bad
his
tactical
position
was
even
worse
his
left
covering
raccoon
and
somerville
fords
was
very
weak
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
massed
on
the
opposite
flank
several
miles
distant
astride
the
direct
road
from
gordonsville
to
culpeper
court
house
and
he
remained
without
the
least
idea
so
late
as
the
morning
of
the
that
the
whole
confederate
army
was
concentrated
behind
clark
mountain
within
six
miles
of
his
most
vulnerable
point
aware
that
jackson
was
based
on
gordonsville
he
seems
to
have
been
convinced
that
if
he
advanced
at
all
he
would
advance
directly
on
culpeper
court
house
and
the
move
to
pisgah
church
which
left
gordonsville
unprotected
never
entered
into
his
calculations
a
sudden
attack
against
his
left
was
the
last
contingency
that
he
anticipated
and
had
the
confederates
moved
as
lee
intended
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
the
federal
army
deprived
of
all
supplies
cut
off
from
washington
and
forced
to
fight
on
ground
where
it
was
unprepared
would
have
been
disastrously
defeated
but
it
was
not
to
be
the
design
was
thwarted
by
one
of
those
petty
accidents
which
play
so
large
a
part
in
war
stuart
had
been
instructed
to
lead
the
advance
the
only
brigade
at
his
disposal
had
not
yet
come
up
into
line
but
a
message
had
been
sent
to
appoint
a
rendezvous
and
it
was
expected
to
reach
verdiersville
five
miles
from
raccoon
ford
on
the
night
of
the
stuart
message
however
was
not
sufficiently
explicit
nothing
was
said
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
and
the
brigadier
general
fitzhugh
lee
not
realising
the
importance
of
reaching
verdiersville
on
the
marched
by
a
circuitous
route
in
order
to
replenish
his
supplies
at
nightfall
he
was
still
absent
and
the
omission
of
a
few
words
in
a
simple
order
cost
the
confederates
dear
moreover
stuart
himself
who
had
ridden
to
verdiersville
with
a
small
escort
narrowly
escaped
capture
his
plumed
hat
with
which
the
whole
army
was
familiar
as
well
as
his
and
his
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
federal
reconnoitring
party
and
among
the
papers
brought
to
pope
was
found
a
letter
from
general
lee
disclosing
the
fact
that
jackson
had
been
strongly
reinforced
in
consequence
of
the
absence
of
fitzhugh
lee
brigade
the
movement
was
postponed
until
the
morning
of
the
the
was
of
opinion
that
the
horses
exhausted
by
their
long
march
would
require
some
rest
before
they
were
fit
for
the
hard
work
he
proposed
for
them
jackson
for
once
in
opposition
urged
that
the
movement
should
go
forward
his
signal
officer
on
clark
mountain
reported
that
the
enemy
was
quiet
and
even
extending
his
right
up
stream
the
location
of
the
federal
divisions
had
been
already
ascertained
the
cavalry
was
not
required
to
get
information
there
was
no
need
therefore
to
wait
till
fitzhugh
lee
brigade
was
fit
for
movement
jackson
had
with
his
own
command
a
sufficient
number
of
squadrons
to
protect
the
front
and
flanks
of
the
whole
army
and
the
main
object
was
not
to
cut
the
enemy
communications
but
to
turn
his
left
and
annihilate
him
pope
was
still
isolated
still
unconscious
of
his
danger
and
the
opportunity
might
never
return
the
suggestion
however
was
overruled
and
it
was
fortunate
says
one
of
pope
generals
that
jackson
was
not
in
command
of
the
confederates
on
the
night
of
august
for
the
superior
force
of
the
enemy
must
have
overwhelmed
us
if
we
could
not
have
escaped
and
escape
on
that
night
was
impossible
general
george
gordon
the
army
of
virginia
page
it
is
probable
however
that
other
causes
induced
general
lee
to
hold
his
hand
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
not
only
the
cavalry
that
was
unprepared
the
movement
from
richmond
had
been
rapid
and
both
vehicles
and
supplies
had
been
delayed
nor
were
all
the
generals
so
avaricious
of
time
as
jackson
it
was
impossible
it
was
urged
to
move
without
some
food
in
the
waggons
jackson
replied
that
the
enemy
had
a
large
magazine
at
brandy
station
which
might
easily
be
captured
and
that
the
intervening
district
promised
an
abundance
of
ripening
corn
and
green
apples
it
was
decided
however
that
such
fare
on
which
it
may
be
said
the
confederates
learned
afterwards
to
subsist
for
many
days
in
succession
was
too
meagre
for
the
work
in
hand
jackson
runs
the
story
groaned
so
audibly
when
lee
pronounced
in
favour
of
postponement
that
longstreet
called
the
attention
of
the
to
his
apparent
disrespect
august
be
this
as
it
may
had
it
been
possible
to
adopt
jackson
advice
the
federal
army
would
have
been
caught
in
the
execution
of
a
difficult
manoeuvre
on
the
morning
of
the
about
the
very
hour
that
the
advance
should
have
begun
pope
was
informed
by
a
spy
that
the
confederate
army
was
assembled
behind
clark
mountain
and
the
neighbouring
hills
that
the
artillery
horses
were
harnessed
and
that
the
troops
were
momentarily
expecting
orders
to
cross
the
river
and
strike
his
rear
he
at
once
made
preparations
for
retreat
the
trains
moved
off
to
seek
shelter
behind
the
rappahannock
and
the
army
followed
leaving
the
cavalry
in
position
and
marching
as
follows
reno
by
stevensburg
to
kelly
ford
banks
and
mcdowell
by
culpeper
court
house
and
brandy
station
to
the
rappahannock
railway
bridge
sigel
by
rixeyville
to
sulphur
springs
august
the
march
was
slow
and
halts
were
frequent
the
long
lines
of
waggons
blocked
every
road
and
on
the
morning
of
august
the
troops
were
still
at
some
distance
from
the
rappahannock
in
neither
condition
nor
formation
to
resist
a
resolute
attack
august
the
movement
however
was
not
discovered
by
the
confederates
until
it
had
been
more
than
hours
in
progress
general
lee
on
august
had
taken
his
stand
on
clark
mountain
but
the
weather
was
unfavourable
for
observation
late
in
the
afternoon
the
haze
lifted
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
remaining
tents
of
the
federal
army
fifteen
miles
away
to
the
suddenly
vanished
from
the
landscape
and
great
clouds
of
dust
rising
high
above
the
woods
left
it
no
longer
doubtful
that
pope
had
taken
the
alarm
it
was
too
late
to
interfere
and
the
sun
set
on
an
army
baffled
of
its
prey
in
the
confederate
councils
there
was
some
dismay
among
the
troops
much
every
hour
that
was
wasted
brought
nearer
the
junction
of
pope
and
mcclellan
and
the
soldiers
were
well
aware
that
a
most
promising
opportunity
which
it
was
worth
while
living
on
green
corn
and
apples
to
secure
had
been
allowed
to
slip
nevertheless
the
pursuit
was
prompt
by
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
the
advanced
guards
plunged
into
the
clear
waters
of
the
rapidan
and
the
whole
army
crossed
by
raccoon
and
somerville
fords
stuart
with
robertson
and
fitzhugh
lee
brigades
pressed
forward
on
the
traces
of
the
retreating
foe
near
brandy
station
the
federal
cavalry
made
a
stubborn
stand
the
confederates
covering
a
wide
front
had
become
separated
robertson
had
marched
through
stevensburg
fitzhugh
lee
on
kelly
ford
an
interval
of
six
miles
dividing
the
two
brigades
and
when
robertson
was
met
by
squadrons
holding
a
skirt
of
woods
with
dismounted
men
it
was
several
hours
before
a
sufficient
force
could
be
assembled
to
force
the
road
towards
evening
two
of
fitzhugh
lee
regiments
came
up
and
the
confederates
were
now
concentrated
in
superior
numbers
a
series
of
vigorous
charges
delivered
by
successive
regiments
on
a
front
of
fours
for
the
horsemen
were
confined
to
the
road
hurried
the
retreating
federals
across
the
rappahannock
but
the
presence
of
infantry
and
guns
near
the
railway
bridge
placed
an
effective
barrier
in
the
way
of
further
pursuit
before
nightfall
jackson
advanced
guard
reached
brandy
station
after
a
march
of
twenty
miles
and
longstreet
bivouacked
near
kelly
ford
the
rappahannock
a
broad
and
rapid
stream
with
banks
high
and
now
rolled
between
the
hostile
armies
pope
by
his
timely
retreat
had
gained
a
position
where
he
could
be
readily
reinforced
and
although
the
river
in
consequence
of
the
long
drought
had
much
dwindled
from
its
usual
volume
his
front
was
perfectly
secure
the
situation
with
which
the
confederate
commander
had
now
to
deal
was
beset
by
difficulties
the
delay
from
august
to
august
had
been
most
unfortunate
the
federals
were
actually
nearer
richmond
than
the
army
of
northern
virginia
and
if
mcclellan
landing
as
burnside
had
done
at
aquia
creek
were
to
move
due
south
through
fredericksburg
he
would
find
the
capital
but
feebly
garrisoned
it
was
more
probable
however
that
he
would
reinforce
pope
and
lee
held
fast
to
his
idea
of
crushing
his
enemies
in
detail
aquia
creek
was
only
miles
march
from
the
rappahannock
but
the
disembarkation
with
horses
trains
and
artillery
must
needs
be
a
lengthy
process
and
it
might
still
be
possible
by
skilful
and
swift
manoeuvres
to
redeem
the
time
which
had
been
already
lost
but
the
federal
position
was
very
strong
august
early
on
the
it
was
ascertained
that
pope
whole
army
was
massed
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rappahannock
extending
from
ford
to
hazel
run
and
that
a
powerful
artillery
crowned
the
commanding
bluffs
to
turn
the
line
of
the
river
from
the
south
was
hardly
practicable
the
federal
cavalry
was
vigilant
and
pope
would
have
quietly
fallen
back
on
washington
a
turning
movement
from
the
north
was
more
promising
and
during
the
day
stuart
supported
by
jackson
made
vigorous
efforts
to
find
a
passage
across
the
river
covered
by
a
heavy
fire
of
artillery
the
squadrons
drove
in
a
regiment
and
a
battery
holding
beverley
ford
and
spread
their
patrols
over
the
country
on
the
left
bank
it
was
soon
evident
however
that
the
ground
was
unsuitable
for
attack
and
stuart
menaced
by
a
strong
force
of
infantry
withdrew
his
troopers
across
the
stream
nothing
further
was
attempted
jackson
went
into
bivouac
near
james
church
and
longstreet
closed
in
upon
his
right
august
the
next
morning
in
accordance
with
lee
orders
to
seek
a
more
favourable
place
to
cross
higher
up
the
river
and
thus
gain
the
enemy
right
jackson
still
preceded
by
stuart
and
concealing
his
march
as
far
as
possible
in
the
woods
moved
towards
the
fords
near
warrenton
springs
longstreet
meanwhile
marched
towards
the
bridge
at
rappahannock
station
where
the
enemy
had
established
a
and
bringing
his
guns
into
action
at
every
opportunity
made
brisk
demonstrations
along
the
river
late
in
the
afternoon
after
an
attack
on
his
at
mill
had
been
repulsed
by
trimble
reinforced
by
hood
jackson
under
a
lowering
sky
reached
the
ruined
bridge
at
the
sulphur
springs
only
a
few
of
the
enemy
cavalry
had
been
descried
and
he
at
once
made
preparations
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
rappahannock
the
georgia
dashed
through
the
ford
and
occupied
the
cottages
of
the
little
early
brigade
and
two
batteries
crossed
by
an
old
a
mile
below
and
took
post
on
the
ridge
beyond
but
heavy
rain
had
begun
to
fall
the
night
was
closing
in
and
the
river
swollen
by
the
storms
in
the
mountains
was
already
rising
the
difficulties
of
the
passage
increased
every
moment
and
the
main
body
of
the
valley
army
was
ordered
into
bivouac
on
the
western
bank
it
was
not
however
the
darkness
of
the
ford
or
the
precarious
footing
of
the
that
held
jackson
back
from
reinforcing
his
advanced
guard
but
the
knowledge
that
these
dangerous
roadways
would
soon
be
submerged
by
a
raging
torrent
early
was
indeed
in
peril
but
it
was
better
that
one
brigade
should
take
its
chance
of
escape
than
that
one
half
the
column
should
be
cut
off
from
the
remainder
august
next
morning
the
pioneers
were
ordered
to
repair
the
bridge
while
longstreet
feinting
strongly
against
the
gave
pope
occupation
early
troops
under
cover
of
the
woods
moved
northward
to
the
protection
of
a
creek
named
great
run
and
although
the
federal
cavalry
kept
close
watch
upon
him
no
attack
was
made
till
nightfall
this
was
easily
beaten
back
and
jackson
anxious
to
keep
the
attention
of
the
enemy
fixed
on
this
point
sent
over
another
brigade
august
at
dawn
on
the
however
as
the
federals
were
reported
to
be
advancing
in
force
the
detachment
was
brought
back
to
the
confederate
bank
the
men
had
been
for
two
days
and
a
night
without
food
or
shelter
it
was
in
vain
that
early
after
the
bridge
had
been
restored
had
requested
to
be
withdrawn
jackson
sent
lawton
to
reinforce
him
with
the
curt
message
tell
general
early
to
hold
his
position
and
although
the
generals
grumbled
at
their
isolation
pope
was
effectually
deluded
into
the
conviction
that
a
serious
attack
had
been
repulsed
and
that
no
further
attempt
to
turn
his
right
was
to
be
immediately
apprehended
the
significance
of
jackson
action
will
be
seen
hereafter
while
jackson
was
thus
mystifying
the
enemy
both
longstreet
and
stuart
had
been
hard
at
work
the
former
after
an
artillery
contest
of
several
hours
duration
had
driven
the
enemy
from
his
on
the
railway
and
had
burnt
the
bridge
the
latter
on
the
morning
of
the
had
moved
northward
with
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
except
two
regiments
and
had
ridden
round
the
federal
right
crossing
the
rappahannock
at
waterloo
bridge
and
hart
mills
he
marched
eastward
without
meeting
a
single
hostile
scout
and
as
evening
fell
the
column
of
men
and
two
pieces
of
artillery
clattered
into
warrenton
the
troopers
dismounted
in
the
streets
the
horses
were
fed
and
watered
and
while
the
officers
amused
themselves
by
registering
their
names
embellished
with
fantastic
titles
at
the
hotel
stuart
staff
questioning
the
throng
of
women
and
old
men
elicited
important
information
none
of
the
enemy
cavalry
had
been
seen
in
the
vicinity
for
some
days
and
pope
supply
trains
were
parked
at
catlett
station
on
the
orange
and
alexandria
railway
ten
miles
after
an
hour
rest
the
force
moved
on
and
passing
through
auburn
village
was
caught
by
the
same
storm
that
had
cut
off
early
the
narrow
roads
became
running
streams
and
the
creeks
which
crossed
the
line
of
march
soon
rose
to
the
withers
but
this
was
the
very
condition
of
the
elements
most
favourable
for
the
enterprise
the
enemy
vedettes
and
patrols
sheltering
from
the
fury
of
the
storm
were
captured
one
after
another
by
the
advanced
guard
and
the
two
brigades
arrived
at
catlett
station
without
the
federals
receiving
the
least
notice
of
their
approach
a
moment
halt
a
short
consultation
a
silent
movement
forward
and
the
astonished
sentinels
were
overpowered
beyond
were
the
encampments
and
the
trains
guarded
by
infantry
and
horsemen
the
night
was
dark
the
darkest
said
stuart
that
he
had
ever
known
without
a
guide
concerted
action
seemed
impossible
the
rain
still
fell
in
torrents
and
the
raiders
soaked
to
the
skin
could
only
grope
aimlessly
in
the
gloom
but
just
at
this
moment
a
negro
was
captured
who
recognised
stuart
and
who
knew
where
baggage
and
horses
were
to
be
found
he
was
told
to
lead
the
way
and
colonel
lee
a
son
of
the
was
ordered
to
follow
with
his
regiment
the
guide
led
the
column
towards
the
headquarter
tents
then
there
mingled
with
the
noise
of
the
rain
upon
the
canvas
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
in
the
forest
the
rushing
sound
of
many
horsemen
of
loud
voices
and
clashing
sabres
one
of
pope
staff
officers
together
with
the
uniform
and
horses
of
the
federal
commander
his
treasure
chest
and
his
personal
effects
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
and
the
greater
part
of
the
enemy
troops
suddenly
alarmed
in
the
deep
darkness
dispersed
into
the
woods
another
camp
was
quickly
looted
and
the
and
virginia
cavalry
were
sent
across
the
railway
riding
without
accident
notwithstanding
the
darkness
over
a
high
embankment
with
deep
ditches
on
either
side
but
the
federal
guards
had
now
rallied
under
cover
and
the
attack
on
the
railway
waggons
had
to
be
abandoned
another
party
had
taken
in
hand
the
main
object
of
the
expedition
the
destruction
of
the
railway
bridge
over
cedar
run
the
force
which
should
have
defended
it
was
surprised
and
scattered
the
timbers
however
were
by
this
time
thoroughly
saturated
and
only
a
few
axes
had
been
discovered
some
federal
skirmishers
maintained
a
heavy
fire
from
the
opposite
bank
and
it
was
impossible
to
complete
the
work
the
telegraph
was
more
easily
dealt
with
and
shortly
before
daylight
on
the
carrying
with
him
prisoners
including
many
officers
stuart
withdrew
by
the
light
of
the
blazing
camp
and
after
a
march
of
sixty
miles
in
hours
reached
the
sulphur
springs
before
evening
the
most
important
result
of
this
raid
was
the
capture
of
dispatch
book
containing
most
detailed
information
as
to
his
strength
dispositions
and
designs
referring
to
the
reinforcements
he
expected
and
disclosing
his
belief
that
the
line
of
the
rappahannock
was
no
longer
tenable
but
the
enterprise
had
an
indirect
it
upon
the
enemy
calculations
which
was
not
without
bearing
on
the
campaign
pope
believed
that
stuart
advance
on
catlett
station
had
been
made
in
connection
with
jackson
attempt
to
cross
at
sulphur
springs
and
the
retreat
of
the
cavalry
combined
with
that
of
early
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
movement
to
turn
his
right
had
been
definitely
abandoned
the
federal
commander
was
soon
to
be
undeceived
thrice
had
general
lee
been
baulked
the
enemy
who
should
have
been
annihilated
on
august
had
gained
six
days
respite
on
the
he
had
placed
himself
behind
the
rappahannock
on
the
the
rising
waters
forbade
jackson
passage
at
the
sulphur
springs
and
now
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
situation
was
still
unchanged
disregarding
longstreet
demonstrations
pope
had
marched
northward
keeping
pace
with
jackson
and
his
whole
force
was
concentrated
on
the
great
road
which
runs
from
the
sulphur
springs
through
warrenton
and
gainesville
to
washington
and
alexandria
he
had
answered
move
by
countermove
hitherto
except
in
permitting
early
to
recross
the
river
he
had
made
no
mistake
and
he
had
gained
time
he
had
marched
over
thirty
miles
and
executed
complicated
manoeuvres
without
offering
the
confederates
an
opening
his
position
near
the
sulphur
springs
was
as
strong
as
that
which
he
had
left
on
the
lower
reaches
near
the
railway
bridge
moreover
the
correspondence
in
his
dispatch
book
disclosed
the
fact
that
a
portion
at
least
of
mcclellan
army
had
landed
at
aquia
creek
and
was
marching
to
bealtown
between
august
and
pope
received
the
following
reinforcements
for
the
army
of
the
potomac
raising
his
strength
to
over
men
third
corps
heintzleman
hooker
division
kearney
division
fifth
corps
porter
morell
division
sykes
division
pennsylvania
reserves
reynolds
that
a
strong
force
drawn
from
the
kanawha
valley
and
elsewhere
was
assembling
at
washington
and
that
men
might
be
concentrated
within
a
few
days
on
the
rappahannock
lee
on
learning
mcclellan
destination
immediately
asked
that
the
troops
which
had
been
retained
at
richmond
should
be
sent
to
join
him
davis
assented
but
it
was
not
till
the
request
had
been
repeated
and
time
lost
that
the
divisions
of
hill
and
mclaws
two
brigades
of
infantry
under
walker
and
cavalry
brigade
were
ordered
up
yet
these
reinforcements
only
raised
lee
numbers
to
men
and
they
were
from
eighty
to
a
hundred
miles
distant
by
an
indifferent
railroad
nor
was
it
possible
to
await
their
arrival
instant
action
was
imperative
but
what
action
was
possible
a
defensive
attitude
could
only
result
in
the
confederate
army
being
forced
back
by
superior
strength
and
retreat
on
richmond
would
be
difficult
for
the
federals
held
the
interior
lines
the
offensive
seemed
out
of
the
question
pope
position
was
more
favourable
than
before
his
army
was
massed
and
reinforcements
were
close
at
hand
his
right
flank
was
well
secured
the
ford
at
sulphur
springs
and
the
waterloo
bridge
were
both
in
his
possession
north
of
the
springs
rose
the
bull
run
mountains
a
range
covered
with
thick
forest
and
crossed
by
few
roads
and
his
left
was
protected
by
the
march
of
mcclellan
army
corps
from
aquia
creek
even
the
genius
of
a
napoleon
might
well
have
been
baffled
by
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
attack
but
there
were
men
in
the
confederate
army
to
whom
overwhelming
numbers
and
strong
positions
were
merely
obstacles
to
be
overcome
on
august
lee
removed
his
headquarters
to
jefferson
where
jackson
was
already
encamped
and
on
the
same
evening
with
pope
captured
correspondence
before
them
the
two
generals
discussed
the
problem
what
occurred
at
this
council
of
war
was
never
made
public
to
use
lee
words
a
plan
of
operations
was
determined
on
but
by
whom
it
was
suggested
there
is
none
to
tell
us
jackson
was
so
reticent
writes
mcguire
that
it
was
only
by
accident
that
we
ever
found
out
what
he
proposed
to
do
and
there
is
no
staff
officer
living
who
could
throw
any
light
on
this
matter
the
day
before
we
started
to
march
round
pope
army
i
saw
lee
and
jackson
conferring
together
jackson
for
him
was
very
much
excited
drawing
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
a
map
in
the
sand
and
gesticulating
in
a
much
more
earnest
way
than
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
general
lee
was
simply
listening
and
after
jackson
had
got
through
he
nodded
his
head
as
if
acceding
to
some
proposal
i
believe
from
what
occurred
afterwards
that
jackson
suggested
the
movement
as
it
was
made
but
i
have
no
further
proof
than
the
incident
i
have
just
mentioned
letter
to
the
author
it
is
only
certain
that
we
have
record
of
few
enterprises
of
greater
daring
than
that
which
was
then
decided
on
and
no
matter
from
whose
brain
it
emanated
on
lee
fell
the
burden
of
the
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
and
on
his
alone
rested
the
honour
of
the
confederate
arms
the
fate
of
richmond
the
independence
of
the
south
and
if
we
may
suppose
so
consonant
was
the
design
proposed
with
the
strategy
which
jackson
had
already
practised
that
it
was
to
him
its
inception
was
due
it
is
still
to
lee
that
we
must
assign
the
higher
merit
it
is
easy
to
conceive
it
is
less
easy
to
execute
but
to
risk
cause
and
country
name
and
reputation
on
a
single
throw
and
to
abide
the
issue
with
unflinching
heart
is
the
supreme
exhibition
of
the
fortitude
lee
decision
was
to
divide
his
army
jackson
marching
northwards
was
to
cross
the
bull
run
mountains
at
thoroughfare
gap
ten
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
the
enemy
right
and
strike
the
railway
which
formed
pope
line
of
supply
the
federal
commander
who
would
meanwhile
be
held
in
play
by
longstreet
would
be
compelled
to
fall
back
in
a
direction
to
save
his
communications
and
thus
be
drawn
away
from
mcclellan
longstreet
would
then
follow
jackson
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
federals
disconcerted
by
these
movements
might
be
attacked
in
detail
or
forced
to
fight
at
a
disadvantage
the
risk
however
was
very
great
an
army
of
men
was
about
to
march
into
a
region
occupied
by
pope
washington
and
aquia
creek
lee
was
well
aware
from
the
correspondence
which
stuart
had
captured
if
indeed
he
had
not
already
inferred
it
that
pope
had
been
strictly
enjoined
to
cover
washington
and
that
he
was
dependent
on
the
railway
for
supplies
there
was
not
the
slightest
fear
of
his
falling
back
towards
aquia
creek
to
join
mcclellan
who
might
easily
be
reinforced
to
and
it
was
to
march
in
two
wings
separated
from
each
other
by
two
days
march
if
pope
were
to
receive
early
warning
of
jackson
march
he
might
hurl
his
whole
force
on
one
or
the
other
moreover
defeat
with
both
pope
and
mcclellan
between
the
confederates
and
richmond
spelt
ruin
and
nothing
less
but
as
lee
said
after
the
war
referring
to
the
criticism
evoked
by
manoeuvres
in
this
as
in
other
of
his
campaigns
which
were
daring
even
to
rashness
such
criticism
is
obvious
but
the
disparity
of
force
between
the
contending
forces
rendered
the
risks
unavoidable
the
army
of
northern
virginia
colonel
allan
page
in
the
present
case
the
only
alternative
was
an
immediate
retreat
and
retreat
so
long
as
the
enemy
was
not
fully
concentrated
and
there
was
a
chance
of
dealing
with
him
in
detail
was
a
measure
which
neither
lee
nor
jackson
was
ever
willing
to
advise
on
the
evening
of
the
jackson
began
his
preparations
for
the
most
famous
of
his
marches
his
troops
were
quietly
withdrawn
from
before
the
sulphur
springs
and
longstreet
division
unobserved
by
the
federals
took
their
place
captain
boswell
was
ordered
to
report
on
the
most
direct
and
hidden
route
to
manassas
junction
and
the
three
divisions
ewell
hill
and
the
stonewall
now
commanded
by
taliaferro
assembled
near
jefferson
three
days
cooked
rations
were
to
be
carried
in
the
haversacks
and
a
herd
of
cattle
together
with
the
green
corn
standing
in
the
fields
was
relied
upon
for
subsistence
until
requisition
could
be
made
on
the
federal
magazines
the
troops
marched
light
knapsacks
were
left
behind
tin
cans
and
a
few
formed
the
only
camp
equipment
and
many
an
outfit
consisted
of
a
few
badly
baked
biscuits
and
a
handful
of
salt
august
long
before
dawn
the
divisions
were
afoot
the
men
were
hungry
and
their
rest
had
been
short
but
they
were
old
acquaintances
of
the
morning
star
and
to
march
while
the
east
was
still
grey
had
become
a
matter
of
routine
but
as
their
guides
led
northward
and
the
sound
of
the
guns
opening
along
the
rappahannock
grew
fainter
and
fainter
a
certain
excitement
began
to
pervade
the
column
something
mysterious
was
in
the
air
what
their
movement
portended
not
the
shrewdest
of
the
soldiers
could
divine
but
they
recalled
their
marches
in
the
valley
and
their
inevitable
results
and
they
knew
instinctively
that
a
surprise
on
a
still
larger
scale
was
in
contemplation
the
thought
was
enough
asking
no
questions
and
full
of
enthusiasm
they
followed
with
quick
step
the
leader
in
whom
their
confidence
had
become
so
absolute
the
flood
had
subsided
on
the
upper
rappahannock
and
the
divisions
forded
it
at
hinson
mill
unmolested
and
apparently
unobserved
without
halting
it
pressed
on
boswell
with
a
small
escort
of
cavalry
leading
the
way
the
march
led
first
by
amissville
thence
north
to
orleans
beyond
river
and
thence
to
salem
a
village
on
the
manassas
gap
railroad
where
the
roads
diverged
from
the
shortest
line
the
troops
took
to
the
fields
guides
were
stationed
by
the
advanced
guard
at
each
gap
and
gate
which
marked
the
route
every
precaution
was
taken
to
conceal
the
movement
the
roads
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
were
watched
by
cavalry
and
so
far
as
possible
the
column
was
directed
through
woods
and
valleys
the
men
although
they
knew
nothing
of
their
destination
whether
winchester
or
harper
ferry
or
even
washington
itself
strode
on
mile
after
mile
through
field
and
ford
in
the
fierce
heat
of
the
august
noon
without
question
or
complaint
old
jack
had
asked
them
to
do
their
best
and
that
was
enough
to
command
their
most
strenuous
efforts
near
the
end
of
the
day
jackson
rode
to
the
head
of
the
leading
brigade
and
complimented
the
officers
on
the
fine
condition
of
the
troops
and
the
regularity
of
the
march
they
had
made
more
than
twenty
miles
and
were
still
moving
briskly
well
closed
up
and
without
stragglers
then
standing
by
the
wayside
he
watched
his
army
pass
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
rays
struck
full
on
his
familiar
face
brown
with
exposure
and
his
dusty
uniform
division
led
the
way
and
when
the
men
saw
their
general
they
prepared
to
salute
him
with
their
usual
greeting
but
as
they
began
to
cheer
he
raised
his
hand
to
stop
them
and
the
word
passed
down
the
column
do
shout
boys
the
yankees
will
hear
us
and
the
soldiers
contented
themselves
with
swinging
their
caps
in
mute
acclamation
when
the
next
division
passed
a
deeper
flush
spread
over
jackson
face
here
were
the
men
he
had
so
often
led
to
triumph
the
men
he
had
trained
himself
the
men
of
the
valley
of
the
first
manassas
of
kernstown
and
the
stonewall
regiments
were
before
him
and
he
was
unable
to
restrain
them
devotion
such
as
theirs
was
not
to
be
silenced
at
such
a
moment
and
the
wild
of
his
own
brigade
set
his
pulses
tingling
for
once
a
breach
of
discipline
was
condoned
it
is
of
no
use
said
jackson
turning
to
his
staff
you
see
i
ca
stop
them
and
then
with
a
sudden
access
of
intense
pride
in
his
gallant
veterans
he
added
half
to
himself
who
could
fail
to
win
battles
with
such
men
as
these
it
was
midnight
before
the
column
halted
near
salem
village
and
the
men
wearied
outright
with
their
march
of
miles
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
by
the
piles
of
muskets
without
even
troubling
to
unroll
their
blankets
so
far
the
movement
had
been
entirely
successful
not
a
federal
had
been
seen
and
none
appeared
during
the
warm
midsummer
night
yet
the
soldiers
were
permitted
scant
time
for
rest
once
more
they
were
aroused
while
the
stars
were
bright
and
half
awake
snatching
what
food
they
could
they
stumbled
forward
through
the
darkness
august
as
the
cool
breath
of
the
morning
rose
about
them
the
dark
forests
of
the
bull
run
mountains
became
gradually
visible
in
the
faint
light
of
the
eastern
sky
and
the
men
at
last
discovered
whither
their
general
was
leading
them
with
the
knowledge
which
spread
quickly
through
the
ranks
that
they
were
making
for
the
communications
of
the
boaster
pope
the
regiments
stepped
out
with
renewed
energy
there
was
no
need
for
speech
no
breath
to
spare
if
there
had
been
only
the
shuffling
tramp
of
marching
feet
the
rumbling
of
wheels
the
creak
and
clank
of
harness
and
accoutrements
with
an
occasional
order
uttered
under
the
breath
and
always
the
same
close
up
men
close
up
battles
and
leaders
volume
page
through
thoroughfare
gap
a
narrow
gorge
in
the
bull
run
range
with
high
cliffs
covered
with
creepers
and
crowned
with
pines
on
either
hand
the
column
wound
steadily
upwards
and
gaining
the
higher
level
the
troops
looked
down
on
the
open
country
to
the
eastward
over
a
vast
area
of
alternate
field
and
forest
bounded
by
distant
uplands
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
were
slowly
sailing
issuing
from
the
mouth
of
the
pass
and
trending
a
little
to
the
ran
the
broad
passing
through
two
tiny
hamlets
haymarket
and
gainesville
and
climbing
by
gentle
gradients
to
a
great
bare
plateau
familiar
to
the
soldiers
of
bull
run
under
the
name
of
manassas
plains
at
gainesville
this
road
was
crossed
by
another
which
lost
in
dense
woods
appeared
once
more
on
the
open
heights
to
the
far
where
the
white
buildings
of
centreville
glistened
in
the
sunshine
the
second
road
was
the
warrenton
and
alexandria
highway
the
direct
line
of
communication
between
army
and
washington
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
divine
the
anxiety
with
which
it
was
scrutinised
by
jackson
if
his
march
had
been
detected
a
far
superior
force
might
already
be
moving
to
intercept
him
at
any
moment
the
news
might
come
in
that
the
federal
army
was
rapidly
approaching
and
even
were
that
not
the
case
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
the
confederate
column
betrayed
by
the
dust
could
escape
the
observation
of
passing
patrols
or
orderlies
but
not
a
solitary
scout
was
visible
no
movement
was
reported
from
the
direction
of
warrenton
and
the
troops
pressed
on
further
and
further
round
the
federal
rear
further
and
further
from
lee
and
longstreet
the
cooked
rations
which
they
carried
had
been
consumed
or
thrown
away
there
was
no
time
for
the
slaughter
and
distribution
of
the
cattle
but
the
men
took
tribute
from
the
fields
and
orchards
and
green
corn
and
green
apples
were
all
the
morning
meal
that
many
of
them
enjoyed
at
gainesville
the
column
was
joined
by
stuart
who
had
maintained
a
fierce
artillery
fight
at
waterloo
bridge
the
previous
day
and
then
slipping
quietly
away
under
cover
of
the
darkness
had
marched
at
two
in
the
morning
to
cover
jackson
flank
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
still
the
enemy
made
no
sign
munford
horsemen
forming
the
advanced
guard
had
long
since
reached
the
alexandria
turnpike
sweeping
up
all
before
them
and
neither
patrols
nor
orderlies
had
escaped
to
carry
the
news
to
warrenton
so
the
point
of
danger
was
safely
passed
and
thirteen
miles
in
rear
of
pope
headquarters
right
across
the
communications
he
had
told
his
troops
to
disregard
the
long
column
swung
swiftly
forward
in
the
noonday
heat
not
a
sound
save
the
muffled
roll
of
many
wheels
broke
the
stillness
of
the
tranquil
valley
only
the
great
dust
cloud
rolling
always
eastward
up
the
slopes
of
the
manassas
plateau
betrayed
the
presence
of
war
beyond
gainesville
jackson
took
the
road
which
led
to
bristoe
station
some
seven
miles
south
of
manassas
junction
neither
the
success
which
had
hitherto
accompanied
his
movement
nor
the
excitement
incident
on
his
situation
had
overbalanced
his
judgment
from
gainesville
the
junction
might
have
been
reached
in
little
more
than
an
hour
march
and
prudence
would
have
recommended
a
swift
dash
at
the
supply
depot
swift
destruction
and
swift
escape
but
it
was
always
possible
that
pope
might
have
been
alarmed
and
the
railroad
from
warrenton
junction
supplied
him
with
the
means
of
throwing
a
strong
force
of
infantry
rapidly
to
his
rear
in
order
to
obstruct
such
a
movement
jackson
had
determined
to
seize
bristoe
station
here
breaking
down
the
railway
bridge
over
broad
run
and
establishing
his
main
body
in
an
almost
impregnable
position
behind
the
stream
he
could
proceed
at
his
leisure
with
the
destruction
of
the
stores
at
manassas
junction
the
advantages
promised
by
this
manoeuvre
more
than
compensated
for
the
increased
length
of
the
march
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
when
the
advanced
guard
arrived
within
striking
distance
of
bristoe
station
munford
squadrons
still
leading
the
way
dashed
upon
the
village
ewell
followed
in
hot
haste
and
a
large
portion
of
the
guard
consisting
of
two
companies
one
of
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
was
immediately
captured
a
train
returning
empty
from
warrenton
junction
to
alexandria
darted
through
the
station
under
a
heavy
fire
the
report
received
at
alexandria
from
manassas
junction
ran
as
follows
no
train
engine
secretary
was
fired
into
at
bristoe
by
a
party
of
cavalry
some
strong
they
had
piled
ties
on
the
track
but
the
engine
threw
them
off
secretary
is
completely
riddled
by
bullets
the
line
was
then
torn
up
and
two
trains
which
followed
in
the
same
direction
as
the
first
were
thrown
down
a
high
embankment
a
fourth
scenting
danger
ahead
moved
back
before
it
reached
the
break
in
the
road
the
column
had
now
closed
up
and
it
was
already
dark
the
escape
of
the
two
trains
was
most
unfortunate
it
would
soon
be
known
both
at
alexandria
and
warrenton
that
manassas
junction
was
in
danger
the
troops
had
marched
nearly
miles
but
if
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
to
be
accomplished
further
exertions
were
absolutely
necessary
trimble
energetic
as
ever
volunteered
with
two
regiments
the
georgia
and
north
carolina
to
move
on
manassas
junction
stuart
was
placed
in
command
and
without
a
moment
delay
the
detachment
moved
northward
through
the
woods
the
night
was
hot
and
moonless
the
infantry
moved
in
order
of
battle
the
skirmishers
in
advance
and
pushing
slowly
forward
over
a
broken
country
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
they
reached
the
junction
half
a
mile
from
the
depot
their
advance
was
greeted
by
a
salvo
of
shells
the
federal
garrison
warned
by
the
fugitives
from
bristoe
station
were
on
the
alert
but
so
harmless
was
their
fire
that
trimble
men
swept
on
without
a
check
the
two
regiments
one
on
either
side
of
the
railroad
halted
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
federal
guns
the
countersign
was
passed
down
the
ranks
and
the
bugles
sounded
the
charge
the
northern
gunners
without
waiting
for
the
onset
fled
through
the
darkness
and
two
batteries
each
with
its
full
complement
of
guns
and
waggons
became
the
prize
of
the
confederate
infantry
stuart
coming
up
on
the
flank
rode
down
the
fugitives
over
prisoners
were
taken
and
the
remainder
of
the
garrison
streamed
northward
through
the
deserted
camps
the
results
of
this
attack
more
than
compensated
for
the
exertions
the
troops
had
undergone
only
confederates
had
been
wounded
and
the
supplies
on
which
pope
army
whether
it
was
intended
to
move
against
longstreet
or
merely
to
hold
the
line
of
the
rappahannock
depended
both
for
food
and
ammunition
were
in
jackson
hands
august
the
next
morning
hill
and
taliaferro
divisions
joined
trimble
ewell
remained
at
bristoe
cavalry
patrols
were
sent
out
in
every
direction
and
jackson
riding
to
manassas
saw
before
him
the
reward
of
his
splendid
march
streets
of
warehouses
stored
to
overflowing
had
sprung
up
round
the
junction
a
line
of
freight
cars
two
miles
in
length
stood
upon
the
railway
thousands
of
barrels
containing
flour
pork
and
biscuit
covered
the
neighbouring
fields
ambulances
were
packed
in
regular
rows
with
the
fires
still
smouldering
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
large
bakery
attracted
the
wondering
gaze
of
the
confederate
soldiery
while
great
pyramids
of
shot
and
shell
piled
with
the
symmetry
of
an
arsenal
testified
to
the
profusion
with
which
the
enemy
artillery
was
supplied
it
was
a
strange
commentary
on
war
washington
was
but
a
long
march
to
the
north
warrenton
pope
headquarters
but
twelve
miles
distant
to
the
and
along
the
rappahannock
between
jackson
and
lee
stood
the
tents
of
a
host
which
outnumbered
the
whole
confederate
army
no
thought
of
danger
had
entered
the
minds
of
those
who
selected
manassas
junction
as
the
depot
of
the
federal
forces
pope
had
been
content
to
leave
a
small
guard
as
a
protection
against
raiding
cavalry
halleck
concerned
only
with
massing
the
whole
army
on
the
rappahannock
had
used
every
effort
to
fill
the
storehouses
if
he
thought
there
was
one
place
in
virginia
where
the
stars
and
stripes
might
be
displayed
in
full
security
that
place
was
manassas
junction
and
here
as
nowhere
else
the
wealth
of
the
north
had
been
poured
out
with
a
prodigality
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
war
to
feed
clothe
and
equip
the
union
armies
no
expenditure
was
deemed
extravagant
for
the
comfort
and
of
the
individual
soldier
the
of
the
nation
were
freely
loosed
no
demand
however
preposterous
was
disregarded
the
markets
of
europe
were
called
upon
to
supply
the
deficiencies
of
the
states
and
if
money
could
have
effected
the
of
the
union
the
war
would
have
already
reached
a
triumphant
issue
but
the
northern
government
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
accumulation
of
men
materiel
and
supplies
is
not
in
itself
sufficient
for
success
money
alone
can
not
provide
good
generals
a
trained

or
an
efficient

and
so
on
this
august
morning
ragged
confederates
the
soldiers
of
a
country
which
ranked
as
the
poorest
of
nations
had
marched
right
round
the
rear
of
the
federal
army
and
were
now
halted
in
undisturbed
possession
of
all
that
made
that
army
an
effective
force
few
generals
have
occupied
a
position
so
commanding
as
did
jackson
on
the
morning
of
august
his
enemies
would
henceforward
have
to
dance
while
he
piped
it
was
jackson
and
not
pope
who
was
to
dictate
the
movements
of
the
federal
army
it
was
impossible
that
the
latter
could
now
maintain
its
position
on
the
rappahannock
and
strategy
had
achieved
its
end
the
capture
of
manassas
junction
however
was
only
the
first
step
in
the
campaign
pope
to
restore
his
communications
with
alexandria
would
be
compelled
to
fall
back
but
before
he
could
be
defeated
the
two
confederate
wings
must
be
united
and
the
harder
part
of
the
work
would
devolve
on
jackson
the
federals
at
warrenton
were
nearer
by
five
miles
to
thoroughfare
gap
his
shortest
line
of
communication
with
lee
and
longstreet
than
he
was
himself
washington
held
a
large
garrison
and
the
railway
was
available
for
the
transit
of
the
troops
the
fugitives
from
manassas
must
already
have
given
the
alarm
and
at
any
moment
the
enemy
might
appear
if
there
were
those
in
the
confederate
ranks
who
considered
the
manoeuvres
of
their
leader
overbold
their
misgivings
were
soon
justified
a
train
full
of
soldiers
from
warrenton
junction
put
back
on
finding
ewell
in
possession
of
bristoe
station
but
a
more
determined
effort
was
made
from
the
direction
of
alexandria
so
early
as
seven
a
brigade
of
infantry
accompanied
by
a
battery
detrained
on
the
north
bank
of
bull
run
and
advanced
in
battle
order
against
the
junction
these
troops
were
sent
forward
without
cavalry
by
order
of
general
halleck
volume
part
page
the
federal
expected
that
the
opposition
would
be
slight
he
had
evidently
no
suspicion
of
the
length
to
which
the
daring
of
lee
and
jackson
might
have
carried
them
the
federals
unaware
that
the
depot
was
held
in
strength
expected
to
drive
before
them
a
few
squadrons
of
cavalry
but
when
several
batteries
opened
a
heavy
fire
and
heavy
columns
advanced
against
their
flanks
the
men
broke
in
flight
towards
the
bridge
the
confederate
infantry
followed
rapidly
and
two
ohio
regiments
which
had
just
arrived
from
the
kanawha
valley
were
defeated
with
heavy
loss
fitzhugh
lee
who
had
fallen
back
before
the
enemy
advance
was
then
ordered
in
pursuit
the
cars
and

bridge
were
destroyed
and
during
the
day
the
brigade
followed
the
fugitives
as
far
as
burke
station
only
twelve
miles
from
alexandria
this
feeble
attack
appears
to
have
convinced
jackson
that
his
danger
was
not
pressing
it
was
evident
that
the
enemy
had
as
yet
no
idea
of
his
strength
stuart
cavalry
watched
every
road
ewell
held
a
strong
position
on
broad
run
barring
the
direct
approach
from
warrenton
junction
and
it
was
determined
to
give
the
wearied
soldiers
the
remainder
of
the
day
for
rest
and
pillage
it
was
impossible
to
carry
away
even
a
tithe
of
the
stores
and
when
an
issue
of
rations
had
been
made
the
bakery
set
working
and
the
liquor
placed
under
guard
the
regiments
were
let
loose
on
the
magazines
such
an
opportunity
occurs
but
seldom
in
the
service
and
the
hungry
confederates
were
not
the
men
to
let
it
pass
weak
and
haggard
from
their
diet
of
green
corn
and
apples
one
can
well
imagine
says
gordon
with
what
surprise
their
eyes
opened
upon
the
contents
of
the
sutlers
stores
containing
an
amount
and
variety
of
property
such
as
they
had
never
conceived
then
came
a
storming
charge
of
men
rushing
in
a
tumultuous
mob
over
each
heads
under
each
other
feet
anywhere
everywhere
to
satisfy
a
craving
stronger
than
a
yearning
for
fame
there
were
no
laggards
in
that
charge
and
there
was
abundant
evidence
of
the
fruits
of
victory
men
ragged
and
famished
clutched
tenaciously
at
whatever
came
in
their
way
whether
of
clothing
or
food

luxury
or
necessity
here
a
long
barefooted
son
of
the

claimed
as
prizes
a
toothbrush
a
box
of
candles
a
barrel
of
coffee
while
another
whose
butternut
homespun
hung
round
him
in
tatters
crammed
himself
with
lobster
salad
sardines
potted
game
and
sweetmeats

washed
them
down
with
rhenish
wine

was
the
outer

themselves

there

more
ludicrous
than
this
wild
revel
at
manassas
even
the
chagrin
of
northern
writers
gives
way
before
the
spectacle
and
jackson
must
have
smiled
grimly
when
he
thought
of
the
maxim
which

had
promulgated
with
such
splendid
confidence
let
us
study
the
probable
lines
of
retreat
of
our
opponents
and
leave
our
own
to
take
care
of
themselves
it
was
no
time
however
to
indulge
in
reflections
on
the
irony
of
fortune
all
through
the
afternoon
while
the
confederates
were
sweeping
away
the
profits
which
the
northern
sutlers
had
wrung
from
northern

stuart

patrols

columns
were
hurrying
over
the
great
highroad
to
gainesville
and
from
warrenton
junction
a
large
force
of
all

was
marching
direct
on

there
was
news
too
from

the
distance
to
be
covered

the
proximity
of
the
enemy

now
formed
jackson
escort
disguised
as
a
countryman
made
his
way
back
from
headquarters

jackson
learned
that
longstreet
who
had
started
the
previous
evening
was
following
his
own
track
by
orleans
salem
and
thoroughfare
gap
up
to
the
night
of
august
we
received
says
longstreet
reports
from

at
regular
intervals
assuring
us
of
his
successful
operation
and
of
confidence
in
his
ability
to
baffle
all
efforts
of
the
enemy

we
should
reach
him

volume
page
it
was
evident
then
that
the
whole
federal
army
was
in
motion
northwards
and
that
longstreet
had
crossed
the
rappahannock
but
longstreet
had
many
miles
to
march
and
thoroughfare
gap
to
pass
before
he
could
lend
assistance
and
the
movement
of
the
enemy
on
gainesville
threatened
to
intervene
between
the
widely
separated
wings
of
the
confederate
army
it
was
no
difficult
matter
for
jackson
to
decide
on
the
course
to
be
adopted
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
to
retreat
at
once
and
only
one
line
of
escape
still
open
the
roads
leading
north
and
from
manassas
junction
to
remain
at
manassas
and
await
lee
arrival
would
have
been
to
sacrifice
his
command
men
even
with
the
protection
of
intrenchments
could
hardly
hope
to
hold
the
whole
federal
army
at
bay
for
two
days
and
it
was
always
possible
that
pope
blocking
thoroughfare
gap
with
a
portion
of
his
force
might
delay
lee
for
even
longer
than
two
days
nor
did
it
recommend
itself
to
jackson
as
sound
strategy
to
move
south
attack
the
federal
column
approaching
bristoe
and
driving
it
from
his
path
to
escape
past
the
rear
of
the
column
moving
to
gainesville
the
exact
position
of
the
federal
troops
was
far
from
clear
large
forces
might
be
encountered
near
the
rappahannock
and
part
of
mcclellan
army
was
known
to
be
marching
westward
from
aquia
creek
moreover
such
a
movement
would
have
accentuated
the
separation
of
the
confederate
wings
and
a
local
success
over
a
portion
of
the
hostile
army
would
have
been
but
a
poor
substitute
for
the
decisive
victory
which
lee
hoped
to
win
when
his
whole
force
was
once
more
concentrated
about
three
in
the
afternoon
the
thunder
of
artillery
was
heard
from
the
direction
of
bristoe
ewell
had
sent
a
brigade
along
the
railroad
to
support
some
cavalry
on
reconnaissance
and
to
destroy
a
bridge
over
kettle
run
hardly
had
the
latter
task
been
accomplished
when
a
strong
column
of
federal
infantry
emerged
from
the
forest
and
deployed
for
action
hooker
division
of
men
belonging
to
mcclellan
army
had
joined
pope
on
the
same
day
that
jackson
had
crossed
the
rappahannock
and
had
been
dispatched
northwards
from
warrenton
junction
as
soon
as
the
news
came
in
that
manassas
junction
had
been
captured
hooker
had
been
instructed
to
ascertain
the
strength
of
the
enemy
at
manassas
for
pope
was
still
under
the
impression
that
the
attack
on
his
rear
was
nothing
more
than
a
repetition
of
the
raid
on
catlett
station
striking
the
confederate
outposts
at
kettle
run
he
deployed
his
troops
in
three
lines
and
pushed
briskly
forward
the
batteries
on
both
sides
opened
and
after
a
hot
skirmish
of
an
hour
duration
ewell
who
had
orders
not
to
risk
an
engagement
with
superior
forces
found
that
his
flanks
were
threatened
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
he
directed
his
three
brigades
to
retire
in
succession
across
broad
run
this
difficult
manoeuvre
was
accomplished
with
trifling
loss
and
hooker
ascertaining
that
jackson
whole
corps
estimated
at
men
was
near
at
hand
advanced
no
further
than
the
stream
ewell
fell
back
slowly
to
the
junction
and
shortly
after
midnight
the
three
confederate
divisions
had
disappeared
into
the
darkness
the
torch
had
already
been
set
to
the
captured
stores
warehouses
trains
camps
and
hospitals
were
burning
fiercely
and
the
dark
figures
of
stuart
troopers
still
urging
on
the
work
passed
to
and
fro
amid
the
flames
of
the
value
of
property
destroyed
it
is
difficult
to
arrive
at
an
estimate
jackson
in
his
official
report
enumerates
the
various
items
with
an
unction
which
he
must
have
inherited
from
some
ancestor
yet
the
actual
quantity
mattered
little
for
the
stores
could
be
readily
replaced
but
the
effect
of
their
destruction
on
the
federal
operations
was
for
the
time
being
overwhelming
and
of
this
destruction
pope
himself
was
a
witness
the
fight
with
ewell
had
just
ceased
and
the
troops
were
going
into
bivouac
when
the
anxious
to
ascertain
with
his
own
eyes
the
extent
of
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
reached
bristoe
station
there
while
the
explosion
of
the
piles
of
shells
resembled
the
noise
of
a
great
battle
from
the
ridge
above
broad
run
he
saw
the
sky
to
the
lurid
with
the
blaze
of
a
vast
conflagration
and
there
he
learned
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
no
mere
raid
of
cavalry
but
stonewall
jackson
with
his
whole
army
corps
who
stood
between
himself
and
washington
for
the
best
part
of
three
days
the
union
general
had
been
completely
mystified
jackson
had
left
jefferson
on
the
but
although
his
march
had
been
seen
by
the
federal
signaller
on
the
hills
near
waterloo

five
messages
were
sent
in
between

evidently
reached

much
later

and
the
exact
strength
of
his
force
had
been
reported
his
destination
had
been
unsuspected
when
the
column
was
last
seen
it
was
moving
northward
from
orleans
but
the
darkness
had
covered
it
and
the
measure
of
prolonging
the
march
to
midnight
bore
good
fruit
for
the
best
part
of
two
days
jackson
had
vanished
from
his
enemy
view
to
be
found
by
pope
himself
at
manassas
junction
there
is
a
curious
undated
report
on
page

part
from
colonel
duffie
a
french
officer
in
the
federal
service
which
speaks
of
a
column
passing
through
thoroughfare
gap
but
although
the
compilers
of
the
records
have
placed
it
under
the
date
august
it
seems
evident
as
this
officer
see
page
was
at
rappahannock
station
on
the
and
volume
part
page
that
the
report
refers
to
longstreet
and
not
jackson
troops
and
was
written
on
august
nevertheless
although
working
in
the
dark
the
federal
commander
up
to
the
moment
he
reached
bristoe
station
had
acted
with
sound
judgment
he
had
inferred
from
the
reports
of
his
signalmen
that
jackson
was
marching
to
front
royal
on
the
shenandoah
but
in
order
to
clear
up
the
situation

it
seemed
improbable
both
to
pope
and
mcdowell
the
second
in
command
that
more
was
meant
by
this
than
a
flank
attack
on
warrenton
mcdowell
expressed
his
opinion
that
a
movement
round
the
right
wing
in
the
direction
of
alexandria
was
far
too
hazardous
for
the
enemy
to
attempt
pope
appears
to
have
acquiesced
and
a
line
of
battle
near
warrenton
with
a
strong
reserve
at
greenwich
to
the
right
rear
was
then
decided
on

of
proceeding

was
disembarking
at

and
halleck
had
been
requested
to
push
these
men
forward
with
all
speed
to
gainesville
the
kanawha
regiments
had
also
reached
washington
and
pope
was
under
the
impression
that
these
too
would
be
sent
to
join
him
he
had
therefore
but
little
apprehension
for
his
rear
the
one
error
of
judgment
into
which
both
pope
and
mcdowell
had
been
betrayed
was
in
not
giving
lee
due
credit
for
audacity
or
jackson
for
energy
that
lee
would
dare
to
divide
his
army
they
had
never
conceived
that
jackson
would
march
fifty
miles
in
two
days
and
place
his
single
corps
astride
their
communications
was
an
idea
which
had
they
thought
of
they
would
have
instantly
dismissed
like
the
austrian
generals
when
they
first
confronted
napoleon
they
might
well
have
complained
that
their
enemy
broke
every
rule
of
the
military
art
and
like
all
generals
who
believe
that
war
is
a
mere
matter
of
precedent
they
found
themselves
egregiously
deceived
the
capture
of
manassas
to
use
pope
own
words
rendered
his
position
at
warrenton
no
longer
tenable
and
early
on
the
the
army
instead
of
concentrating
on
warrenton
was
ordered
to
move
to
gainesville
from
gainesville
it
was
easy
to
block
thoroughfare
gap
buford
cavalry
brigade
was
thrown
out
towards
white
plains
to
observe
longstreet
and
hooker
was
dispatched
to
clear
up
the
situation
at
manassas
this
move
which
was
completed
before
nightfall
could
hardly
have
been
improved
upon
the
whole
federal
army
was
now
established
on
the
direct
line
of
communication
between
jackson
and
lee
and
although
jackson
might
still
escape
the
confederates
had
as
yet
gained
no
advantage
beyond
the
destruction
of
pope
supplies
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
two
wings
could
combine
east
of
the
bull
run
mountains
but
on
the
evening
of
the
after
the
conclusion
of
the
engagement
at
bristoe
station
pope
lost
his
head
the
view
he
now
took
of
the
situation
was
absolutely
erroneous
ewell
retreat
before
hooker
he
interpreted
as
an
easy
victory
which
fully
compensated
for
the
loss
of
his
magazines
he
imagined
that
jackson
had
been
surprised
and
that
no
other
course
was
open
to
him
than
to
take
refuge
in
the
intrenchments
of
manassas

were
at

for
a
manoeuvre
which
should
ensure
the
defeat
of
the
presumptuous
foe
the
federal
army
corps
marching
in
three
columns
were
called
up
to

movement
which
would
leave

by

were

said
pope
with
a
sad
lapse
from
the
poetical
phraseology
he
had
just
employed
august
and
so
on
the
morning
of
the
a
federal
army
once
more
set
out
with
the
expectation
of
surrounding
jackson
to
find
once
more
that
the
task
was
beyond
their
powers
the
march
was
slow
pope
made
no
movement
from
bristoe
station
until
hooker
had
been
reinforced
by
kearney
and
reno
mcdowell
before
he
turned
east
from
gainesville
was
delayed
by
sigel
trains
which
crossed
his
line
of
march
and
it
was
not
till
noon
that
advanced
guard
halted
amid
the
still
smouldering
ruins
on
the
manassas
plateau
the
march
had
been
undisturbed
the
redoubts
were
untenanted
the
woods
to
the
north
were
silent
a
few
vedettes
watched
the
operations
from
ridges
a
few
stragglers
overcome
perhaps
by
their
gargantuan
meal
of
the
previous
evening
were
picked
up
in
the
copses
but
jackson
divisions
had
vanished
from
the
earth
then
came
order
and
pope
was
completely
bewildered
by
four
however
the
news
arrived
that
the
railway
at
station
within
twelve
miles
of
alexandria
had
been
cut
and
that
the
enemy
was
in
force
between
that
point
and
centreville
on
centreville
therefore
the
whole
army
was
now
directed
hooker
kearney
and
reno
forming
the
right
wing
marched
by
ford
and
were
to
be
followed
by
porter
and
banks
sigel
and
reynolds
forming
the
centre
took
the
road
by
new
market
and
the
stone
bridge
mcdowell
king
and
ricketts
divisions
forming
the
left
was
to
pass
through
gainesville
and
groveton
but
when
the
right
wing
reached
centreville
pope
was
still
at
fault
there
were
traces
of
a
marching
column
but
some
small
patrols
of
cavalry
who
retreated
leisurely
before
the
federal
advance
were
the
sole
evidence
of
the
enemy
existence
night
was
at
hand
and
as
the
divisions
he
accompanied
were
directed
to
their
bivouacs
pope
sought
in
vain
for
the
enemy
he
had
believed
so
easy
a
prey
before
his
troops
halted
the
knowledge
came
to
him
far
away
to
the
where
the
great
groveton
valley
backed
by
the
wooded
mountains
lay
green
and
beautiful
rose
the
dull
booming
of
cannon
swelling
to
a
continuous
roar
and
as
the
weary
soldiers
climbing
the
slopes
near
centreville
looked
eagerly
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
the
rolling
smoke
of
a
fierce
battle
was
distinctly
visible
above
the
woods
which
bordered
the
highway
across
bull
run
in
the
neighbourhood
of
groveton
and
still
further
westward
where
the
cleft
in
the
blue
hills
marked
thoroughfare
gap
was
seen
the
flash
of
distant
guns
mcdowell
marching
northwards
through
gainesville
had
evidently
come
into
collision
with
the
enemy
jackson
was
run
to
earth
at
last
and
it
was
now
clear
that
while
pope
had
been
moving
northwards
on
centreville
the
confederates
had
been
moving
westward
and
that
they
were
once
more
within
reach
of
lee
but
by
what
means
pope
might
well
have
asked
had
a
whole
army
corps
with
its
batteries
and
waggons
passed
through
the
cordon
which
he
had
planned
to
throw
around
it
and
passed
through
as
if
gifted
with
the
secret
of
invisibility
the
explanation
was
simple
while
his
enemies
were
watching
the
midnight
glare
above
manassas
jackson
was
moving
north
by
three
roads
and
before
morning
broke
hill
was
near
centreville
ewell
had
crossed
bull
run
by
blackburn
ford
and
taliaferro
was
north
of
bald
hill
with
a
brigade
at
groveton
while
stuart
squadrons
formed
a
screen
to
front
and
flank
then
as
the
federals
slowly
converged
on
manassas
hill
and
ewell
marching
unobserved
along
the
north
bank
of
bull
run
crossed
the
stone
bridge
taliaferro
joined
them
and
before
pope
had
found
that
his
enemy
had
left
the
junction
the
confederates
were
in
bivouac
north
of
groveton
hidden
in
the
woods
and
recovering
from
the
fatigue
of
their
long
night
march
hill
had
marched
fourteen
miles
ewell
fifteen
and
taliaferro
with
whom
were
the
trains
from
eight
to
ten
jackson
arrangements
for
deceiving
his
enemy
for
concealing
his
line
of
retreat
and
for
drawing
pope
northward
on
centreville
had
been
carefully
thought
out
the
march
from
manassas
was
no
hasty
movement
to
the
rear
taliaferro
as
soon
as
darkness
fell
had
moved
by
new
market
on
bald
hill
at
ewell
followed
hill
to
blackburn
ford
but
instead
of
continuing
the
march
on
centrevile
had
crossed
bull
run
and
moving
up
stream
had
joined
taliaferro
by
way
of
the
stone
bridge
hill
leaving
centreville
at
marched
to
the
same
rendezvous
thus
while
the
attention
of
the
enemy
was
attracted
to
centreville
jackson
divisions
were
concentrated
in
the
woods
beyond
bull
bun
some
five
or
six
miles
west
the
position
in
which
his
troops
were
resting
had
been
skilfully
selected
south
of
sudley
springs
and
north
of
the
warrenton
turnpike
it
was
within
twelve
miles
of
thoroughfare
gap
and
a
line
of
retreat
in
case
of
emergency
as
well
as
a
line
by
which
lee
could
join
him
should
thoroughfare
gap
be
blocked
ran
to
aldie
gap
the
northern
pass
of
the
bull
run
mountains
established
on
his
enemy
flank
he
could
avoid
the
full
shock
of
his
force
should
lee
be
delayed
or
he
could
strike
effectively
himself
and
it
was
to
retain
the
power
of
striking
that
he
had
not
moved
further
northward
and
secured
his
front
by
camping
beyond
catharpen
run
it
was
essential
that
he
should
be
prepared
for
offensive
action
the
object
with
which
he
had
marched
upon
manassas
had
only
been
half
accomplished
pope
had
been
compelled
to
abandon
the
strong
line
of
the
rappahannock
but
he
had
not
yet
been
defeated
and
if
he
were
not
defeated
he
would
combine
with
mcclellan
and
advance
in
a
few
days
in
overwhelming
force
lee
looked
for
a
battle
with
pope
before
he
could
be
reinforced
and
to
achieve
this
end
it
was
necessary
that
the
federal
commander
should
be
prevented
from
retreating
further
that
jackson
should
hold
him
by
the
throat
until
lee
should
come
up
to
administer
the
coup
de
grace
it
was
with
this
purpose
in
his
mind
that
jackson
had
taken
post
near
groveton
and
he
was
now
awaiting
the
information
that
should
tell
him
the
time
had
come
to
strike
but
as
already
related
the
march
of
the
federals
on
manassas
was
slow
and
toilsome
it
was
not
till
the
morning
was
well
on
that
the
brigade
of
taliaferro
division
near
groveton
commanded
by
colonel
bradley
johnson
was
warned
by
the
cavalry
that
the
enemy
was
moving
through
gainesville
in
great
strength
a
skirmish
took
place
a
mile
or
two
north
of
that
village
and
johnson
finding
himself
menaced
by
far
superior
numbers
fell
back
to
the
wood
near
the
douglass
house
he
was
not
followed
the
union
generals
sigel
and
reynolds
who
had
been
ordered
to
manassas
to
bag
jackson
had
received
no
word
of
his
departure
from
the
junction
and
believing
that
johnson
small
force
was
composed
only
of
cavalry
they
resumed
the
march
which
had
been
temporarily
interrupted
the
situation
however
was
no
clearer
to
the
confederates
the
enemy
had
disappeared
in
the
great
woods
of
groveton
and
heavy
columns
were
still
reported
coming
up
from
gainesville
during
the
afternoon
however
the
cavalry
captured
a
federal
courier
carrying
mcdowell
orders
for
the
movement
of
the
left
and
centre
which
had
been
placed
under
his
command
to
manassas
junction
and
this
important
document
was
immediately
forwarded
to
jackson
the
order
dated
august
was
to
the
following
effect
sigel
corps
to
march
from
gainesville
to
manassas
junction
the
right
resting
on
the
manassas
railroad
reynolds
to
follow
sigel
king
to
follow
reynolds
ricketts
to
follow
king
but
to
halt
at
thoroughfare
gap
if
the
enemy
threatened
the
pass
king
was
afterwards
while
on
the
march
directed
to
centreville
by
the
road
johnson
messenger
says
general
taliaferro
found
the
confederate
headquarters
established
on
the
shady
side
of
an
in
the
corner
of
which
general
jackson
and
his
division
commanders
were
profoundly
sleeping
after
the
fatigues
of
the
preceding
night
notwithstanding
the
intense
heat
of
the
august
day
there
was
not
so
much
as
an
ambulance
at
headquarters
the
headquarters
train
was
back
beyond
the
rappahannock
at
jefferson
with
remounts
camp
equipage
and
all
the
arrangements
for
cooking
and
serving
food
all
the
property
of
the
general
the
staff
and
the
headquarters
bureau
was
strapped
to
the
pommels
and
cantels
of
the
saddles
and
these
formed
the
pillows
of
their
weary
owners
the
captured
dispatch
roused
jackson
like
an
electric
shock
he
was
essentially
a
man
of
action
he
rarely
if
ever
hesitated
he
never
asked
advice
he
called
no
council
to
discuss
the
situation
disclosed
by
this
communication
although
his
ranking
officers
were
almost
at
his
side
he
asked
no
conference
of
opinion
he
made
no
suggestion
but
simply
without
a
word
except
to
repeat
the
language
of
the
message
turned
to
me
and
said
move
your
division
and
attack
the
enemy
and
to
ewell
the
attack
the
slumbering
soldiers
sprang
from
the
earth
at
the
first
murmur
they
were
sleeping
almost
in
ranks
and
by
the
time
the
horses
of
their
officers
were
saddled
the
long
lines
of
infantry
were
moving
to
the
anticipated
the
two
divisions
after
marching
some
distance
to
the
north
of
the
turnpike
were
halted
and
rested
and
the
prospect
of
an
engagement
on
that
afternoon
seemed
to
disappear
with
the
lengthening
shadows
the
enemy
did
not
come
the
warrenton
turnpike
along
which
it
was
supposed
he
would
march
was
in
view
but
it
was
as
free
from
federal
soldiery
as
it
had
been
two
days
before
when
jackson
men
had
streamed
along
its
highway
battles
and
leaders
volume
pages
and
map
of
the
situation
at
sunset
august
jackson
however
was
better
informed
than
his
subordinate
troops
were
still
moving
through
gainesville
and
instead
of
turning
off
to
manassas
were
marching
up
the
turnpike
on
which
so
many
eyes
were
turned
from
the
neighbouring
woods
king
division
while
on
the
march
to
manassas
had
been
instructed
to
countermarch
and
make
for
centrevile
by
groveton
and
the
stone
bridge
ricketts
who
had
been
ordered
by
mcdowell
to
hold
thoroughfare
gap
was
already
engaged
with
longstreet
advanced
guard
and
of
this
jackson
was
aware
for
stuart
in
position
at
haymarket
three
miles
north
of
gainesville
had
been
skirmishing
all
day
with
the
enemy
cavalry
and
had
been
in
full
view
of
the
conflict
at
the
gap
longstreet
had
been
unable
to
march
with
the
same
speed
as
jackson
leaving
jefferson
on
the
afternoon
of
august
he
did
not
reach
thoroughfare
gap
until
just
before
night
on
august
he
had
been
delayed
for
an
hour
at
white
plains
by
the
federal
cavalry
and
the
trains
of
the
army
such
as
they
were
may
also
have
retarded
him
in
two
days
he
covered
only
thirty
miles
jackson
however
knew
not
that
one
division
was
all
that
was
before
him
the
federal
movements
had
covered
so
wide
an
extent
of
country
and
had
been
so
well
concealed
by
the
forests
that
it
was
hardly
possible
for
stuart
patrols
enterprising
as
they
were
to
obtain
accurate
information
unaccustomed
to
such
disjointed
marches
as
were
now
in
progress
across
his
front
jackson
believed
that
king
column
was
the
of
mcdowell
army
corps
but
although
he
had
been
compelled
to
leave
hill
near
the
stone
bridge
in
order
to
protect
his
line
of
retreat
on
aldie
he
had
still
determined
to
attack
the
main
idea
which
absorbed
his
thoughts
is
clear
enough
the
federal
army
instead
of
moving
direct
from
warrenton
on
alexandria
as
he
had
anticipated
had
apparently
taken
the
more
circuitous
route
by
manassas
and
if
pope
was
to
be
fought
in
the
open
field
before
he
could
be
reinforced
by
mcclellan
he
must
be
induced
to
retrace
his
steps
to
do
this
the
surest
means
was
a
resolute
attack
on
king
division
despite
the
probability
that
it
might
be
strongly
reinforced
and
it
is
by
no
means
unlikely
that
jackson
deferred
his
attack
until
near
sunset
in
order
that
if
confronted
by
superior
numbers
he
might
still
be
able
to
hold
on
till
nightfall
and
obtain
time
for
longstreet
to
come
up
within
the
wood
due
north
of
the
dogan
house
through
which
ran
an
unfinished
railroad
ewell
and
taliaferro
divisions
awaiting
the
propitious
moment
for
attack
were
drawn
up
in
order
of
battle
eight
brigades
and
three
small
batteries
which
had
been
brought
across
country
with
great
difficulty
were
present
and
the
remainder
of
the
artillery
was
not
far
distant
twenty
pieces
had
been
ordered
to
the
front
soon
after
the
infantry
moved
forward
the
dense
woods
however
proved
impenetrable
to
all
but
three
guns
and
one
of
these
was
unable
to
keep
up
taliaferro
on
the
right
had
two
brigades
taliaferro
and
the
stonewall
in
first
line
starke
was
in
second
line
and
bradley
johnson
near
groveton
village
ewell
on
the
left
had
placed
lawton
and
trimble
in
front
while
early
and
forno
formed
a
general
reserve
this
force
numbered
in
all
about
men
and
even
the
skirmishers
thrown
out
well
to
the
front
were
concealed
by
the
undulations
of
the
ground
the
federal
division
commanded
by
general
king
although
unprovided
with
cavalry
and
quite
unsupported
was
no
unworthy
enemy
it
was
composed
of
four
brigades
of
infantry
led
by
excellent
officers
and
accompanied
by
four
batteries
the
total
strength
was
men
the
absence
of
horsemen
however
placed
the
northerners
at
a
disadvantage
from
the
outset
the
leading
brigade
was
within
a
mile
of
groveton
a
hamlet
of
a
few
houses
at
the
foot
of
a
long
descent
and
the
advanced
guard
deployed
as
skirmishers
was
searching
the
woods
in
front
on
the
road
in
rear
with
the
batteries
between
the
columns
came
the
three
remaining
brigades
gibbon
doubleday
and
patrick
in
the
order
named
the
wood
in
which
the
confederates
were
drawn
up
was
near
a
mile
from
the
highway
on
a
commanding
ridge
overlooking
a
broad
expanse
of
open
ground
which
fell
gently
in
successive
undulations
to
the
road
the
federals
were
marching
in
absolute
unconsciousness
that
the
enemy
whom
the
last
reports
had
placed
at
manassas
far
away
to
the
right
was
close
at
hand
no
had
been
thrown
out
general
king
was
at
gainesville
sick
and
a
regimental
band
had
just
struck
up
a
merry
quickstep
on
the
open
fields
to
the
left
bathed
in
sunshine
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
the
whitewashed
cottages
surrounded
by
green
orchards
which
stood
upon
the
slopes
were
lonely
and
untenanted
and
on
the
edge
of
the
distant
wood
still
and
drooping
in
the
heat
was
neither
stir
nor
motion
the
troops
trudged
steadily
forward
through
the
dust
regiment
after
regiment
disappeared
in
the
deep
copse
which
stands
west
of
groveton
and
far
to
the
rear
the
road
was
still
crowded
with
men
and
guns
time
had
come
two
confederate
batteries
trotting
forward
from
the
wood
deployed
upon
the
ridge
the
range
was
soon
found
and
the
effect
was
instantaneous
but
the
confusion
in
the
northern
ranks
was
soon
checked
the
troops
found
cover
inside
the
bank
which
lined
the
road
and
two
batteries
one
with
the
advanced
guard
and
one
from
the
centre
of
the
column
wheeling
into
the
fields
to
the
left
came
quickly
into
action
about
the
same
moment
bradley
johnson
became
engaged
with
the
skirmishers
near
groveton
the
confederate
infantry
still
hidden
by
the
rolling
ground
was
forming
for
attack
when
a
federal
brigade
led
by
general
gibbon
rapidly
deploying
on
the
slopes
moved
forward
against
the
guns
it
was
stuart
so
the
northerners
believed
which
had
fired
on
the
column
and
a
bold
attack
would
soon
drive
back
the
cavalry
but
as
gibbon
regiments
came
forward
the
southern
skirmishers
lying
in
front
of
the
batteries
sprang
to
their
feet
and
opened
with
rapid
volleys
and
then
the
grey
line
of
battle
rising
suddenly
into
view
bore
down
upon
the
astonished
foe
taliaferro
on
the
right
seized
a
small
farmhouse
near
gainesville
and
occupied
the
orchard
the
stonewall
brigade
advanced
upon
his
left
and
lawton
and
trimble
prolonged
the
front
towards
the
douglass
house
but
the
western
farmers
of
gibbon
brigade
were
made
of
stubborn
stuff
the
wisconsin
regiments
held
their
ground
with
unflinching
courage
both
flanks
were
protected
by
artillery
and
strong
reinforcements
were
coming
up
the
advanced
guard
was
gradually
falling
back
from
groveton
the
rear
brigades
were
hurrying
forward
up
the
road
the
two
confederate
batteries
overpowered
by
superior
metal
had
been
compelled
to
shift
position
only
a
section
of
stuart
under
captain
pelham
had
come
to
their
assistance
and
the
battle
was
confined
to
a
frontal
attack
at
the
closest
range
in
many
places
the
lines
approached
within
a
hundred
yards
the
men
standing
in
the
open
and
blazing
fiercely
in
each
other
faces
here
and
there
as
fresh
regiments
came
up
on
either
side
the
grey
or
the
blue
gave
way
for
a
few
short
paces
but
the
gaps
were
quickly
filled
and
the
wave
once
more
surged
forward
over
the
piles
of
dead
men
fell
like
leaves
in
autumn
ewell
was
struck
down
and
taliaferro
and
many
of
their
field
officers
and
still
the
federals
held
their
ground
night
was
settling
on
the
field
and
although
the
gallant
pelham
the
boy
soldier
brought
a
gun
into
action
within
seventy
paces
of
gibbon
line
yet
the
front
of
fire
flashing
redly
through
the
gloom
neither
receded
nor
advanced
a
flank
attack
on
either
side
would
have
turned
the
scale
but
the
fight
was
destined
to
end
as
it
had
begun
the
federal
commander
ignorant
of
the
enemy
strength
and
reaching
the
field
when
the
fight
was
hottest
was
reluctant
to
engage
his
last
reserves
jackson
had
ordered
early
and
forno
moving
through
the
wood
west
of
the
douglass
house
to
turn
the
enemy
right
but
within
the
thickets
ran
the
deep
cuttings
and
high
embankments
of
the
unfinished
railroad
and
the
regiments
bewildered
in
the
darkness
were
unable
to
advance
meanwhile
the
fight
to
the
front
had
gradually
died
away
the
federals
outflanked
upon
the
left
and
far
outnumbered
had
slowly
retreated
to
the
road
the
confederates
had
been
too
roughly
handled
to
pursue
the
reports
of
the
engagement
at
groveton
are
singularly
meagre
preceded
and
followed
by
events
of
still
greater
moment
it
never
attracted
the
attention
it
deserved
on
the
side
of
the
union
men
were
engaged
on
the
side
of
the
southerners
and
for
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
the
lines
of
infantry
were
engaged
at
the
very
closest
quarters
the
rifled
guns
of
the
federals
undoubtedly
gave
them
a
marked
advantage
but
the
men
who
faced
each
other
that
august
evening
fought
with
a
gallantry
that
has
seldom
been
surpassed
the
federals
surprised
and
unsupported
bore
away
the
honours
the
western
brigade
commanded
by
general
gibbon
displayed
a
coolness
and
a
steadfastness
worthy
of
the
soldiers
of
albuera
out
of
men
the
four
wisconsin
and
indiana
regiments
lost
and
were
still
unconquered
the
three
regiments
which
supported
them
although
it
was
their
first
battle
lost
nearly
half
their
number
and
the
casualties
must
have
reached
a
total
of
the
confederate
losses
were
even
greater
ewell
who
was
shot
down
in
the
first
line
and
lay
long
on
the
field
lost
out
of
the
stonewall
brigade
which
had
by
this
time
dwindled
to
muskets
lost
over
including
five
field
officers
the
georgia
of
brigade
men
out
of
and
it
is
probable
that
the
valley
army
on
this
day
was
diminished
by
more
than
stout
soldiers
the
fall
of
ewell
was
a
terrible
disaster
zealous
and
indefatigable
a
stern
fighter
and
beloved
by
his
men
he
was
the
most
able
and
the
most
loyal
of
jackson
generals
taliaferro
peculiarly
acceptable
to
his
virginia
regiments
as
a
virginian
himself
had
risen
from
the
rank
of
colonel
to
the
command
of
a
division
and
his
spurs
had
been
well
won
the
battle
of
groveton
left
gaps
in
jackson
ranks
which
it
was
hard
to
fill
and
although
the
men
might
well
feel
proud
of
their
stubborn
fight
they
could
hardly
boast
of
a
brilliant
victory
strategically
however
the
engagement
was
decisive
jackson
had
brought
on
the
fight
with
the
view
of
drawing
the
whole
federal
army
on
himself
and
he
was
completely
successful
the
centre
marching
on
the
stone
bridge
from
manassas
junction
heard
the
thunder
of
the
cannon
and
turned
westward
and
before
nightfall
artillery
became
engaged
with
sigel
advanced
guard
pope
himself
who
received
the
intelligence
of
the
engagement
at
immediately
issued
orders
for
an
attack
on
jackson
the
next
morning
in
which
the
troops
who
had
already
reached
centreville
were
to
take
part
mcdowell
ran
the
order
has
intercepted
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
sigel
is
immediately
in
his
front
and
i
see
no
possibility
of
his
escape
but
pope
full
of
the
idea
that
jackson
had
been
stopped
in
attempting
to
retreat
through
thoroughfare
gap
altogether
misunderstood
the
situation
he
was
badly
informed
he
did
not
know
even
the
position
of
his
own
troops
his
divisions
scattered
over
a
wide
extent
of
country
harassed
by
stuart
cavalry
and
ignorant
of
the
topography
had
lost
all
touch
with
the
important
dispatches
had
been
captured
messages
and
orders
were
slow
in
arriving
if
they
arrived
at
all
even
the
generals
were
at
a
loss
to
find
either
the
or
the
right
road
mcdowell
had
ridden
from
gainesville
to
manassas
in
order
to
consult
with
pope
but
pope
had
gone
to
centreville
mcdowell
thereupon
set
out
to
rejoin
his
troops
but
lost
his
way
in
the
forest
and
went
back
to
manassas
from
ricketts
pope
received
no
information
whatever
ricketts
report
would
have
been
transmitted
through
mcdowell
under
whose
command
he
was
and
as
mcdowell
was
not
to
be
found
it
naturally
went
astray
he
was
not
aware
that
after
a
long
skirmish
at
thoroughfare
gap
longstreet
had
opened
the
pass
by
sending
his
brigades
over
the
mountains
on
either
hand
threatening
both
flanks
of
the
federals
and
compelling
them
to
retire
he
was
not
aware
that
king
division
so
far
from
intercepting
jackson
retreat
had
abandoned
the
field
of
groveton
at
and
finding
its
position
untenable
in
face
of
superior
numbers
had
fallen
back
on
manassas
or
that
ricketts
who
had
by
this
time
reached
gainesville
had
in
consequence
continued
his
retreat
in
the
same
direction
seldom
have
the
baneful
effects
of
dispersion
been
more
strikingly
illustrated
and
the
difficulty
under
such
circumstances
of
keeping
the
troops
in
the
hand
of
the
on
the
morning
of
the
pope
had
ordered
his
army
to
march
in
three
columns
on
manassas
one
column
starting
from
warrenton
junction
one
from
greenwich
and
one
from
buckland
mills
the
roads
which
they
were
to
follow
being
at
their
furthest
point
no
more
than
seven
miles
apart
and
yet
at
dawn
on
the
he
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
whereabouts
of
mcdowell
army
corps
he
was
but
vaguely
informed
of
what
had
happened
during
the
day
and
while
part
of
his
army
was
at
bald
hill
another
part
was
at
centreville
seven
miles
and
a
third
at
manassas
and
at
bristoe
from
seven
to
twelve
miles
nor
could
the
staff
be
held
to
blame
for
the
absence
of
communication
between
the
columns
in
peace
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
assume
that
a
message
sent
to
a
destination
seven
miles
distant
by
a
highroad
or
even
country
lanes
arrives
in
good
time
seven
miles
in
peace
are
very
short
in
war
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
enemy
they
are
very
long
in
peace
roads
are
easy
to
find
in
war
it
is
the
exception
that
they
are
found
even
when
messengers
are
provided
with
good
maps
and
the
country
is
thickly
populated
and
it
is
from
war
that
the
soldier
trade
is
to
be
learned
jackson
army
corps
bivouacked
in
the
position
they
had
held
when
the
fierce
musketry
of
groveton
died
away
it
was
not
till
long
after
daybreak
on
the
that
his
cavalry
patrols
discovered
that
troops
had
disappeared
and
that
longstreet
advanced
guard
was
already
through
thoroughfare
gap
nor
was
it
till
the
sun
was
high
that
lee
learned
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
and
these
threw
only
a
faint
light
on
the
general
situation
but
had
either
the
or
his
lieutenant
on
the
night
of
the
known
the
true
state
of
affairs
they
would
have
had
reason
to
congratulate
themselves
on
the
success
of
the
plan
which
had
been
hatched
on
the
rappahannock
they
had
anticipated
that
should
jackson
movement
on
manassas
prove
successful
pope
would
not
only
fall
back
but
that
he
would
fall
back
in
all
the
confusion
which
arises
from
a
hastily
conceived
plan
and
hastily
executed
manoeuvres
they
had
expected
that
in
his
hurried
retreat
his
army
corps
would
lose
touch
and
cohesion
that
divisions
would
become
isolated
that
the
care
of
his
impedimenta
suddenly
turned
in
a
new
direction
would
embarrass
every
movement
and
that
the
general
himself
would
become
demoralised
the
orders
and
the
marches
and
of
august
and
the
consequent
dispersion
of
the
federal
army
are
sufficient
in
themselves
to
prove
the
deep
insight
into
war
possessed
by
the
confederate
leaders
nevertheless
the
risk
bred
of
separation
which
in
order
to
achieve
great
results
they
had
deliberately
accepted
had
not
yet
passed
away
longstreet
had
indeed
cleared
the
pass
and
the
federals
who
guarded
it
had
retreated
but
the
main
body
of
the
confederate
army
had
still
twelve
miles
to
march
before
it
could
reach
jackson
and
jackson
was
confronted
by
superior
numbers
on
the
plateau
of
bull
run
little
more
than
two
miles
from
the
field
of
groveton
were
encamped
over
federals
with
the
main
number
at
manassas
at
centreville
a
seven
miles
march
were
and
at
bristoe
station
about
the
same
distance
it
was
thus
possible
for
pope
to
hurl
a
superior
force
against
jackson
before
lee
could
intervene
and
although
it
would
have
been
sounder
strategy
on
the
part
of
the
federal
commander
to
have
concentrated
towards
centreville
and
have
there
awaited
reinforcements
now
fast
coming
up
he
had
some
reason
for
believing
that
he
might
still
unaided
deal
with
the
enemy
in
detail
the
high
virtue
of
patience
was
not
his
ambition
anxiety
to
retrieve
his
reputation
already
blemished
by
his
enforced
retreat
the
thought
that
he
might
be
superseded
by
mcclellan
whose
operations
in
the
peninsula
he
had
contemptuously
criticised
all
urged
him
forward
an
unsuccessful
general
who
feels
instinctively
that
his
command
is
slipping
from
him
and
who
sees
in
victory
the
only
hope
of
retaining
it
seldom
listens
to
the
voice
of
prudence
august
so
on
the
morning
of
the
jackson
had
to
do
with
an
enemy
who
had
resolved
to
overwhelm
him
by
weight
of
numbers
nor
could
he
expect
immediate
help
the
federal
cavalry
still
stood
between
stuart
and
thoroughfare
gap
and
not
only
was
jackson
unaware
that
longstreet
had
broken
through
but
he
was
unaware
whether
he
could
break
through
in
any
case
it
would
be
several
hours
before
he
could
receive
support
and
for
that
space
of
time
his
three
divisions
worn
with
long
marching
and
the
fierce
fight
of
the
previous
evening
would
have
to
hold
their
own
unaided
the
outlook
to
all
appearance
was
anything
but
bright
but
on
the
opposite
hills
where
the
federals
were
now
forming
in
line
of
battle
the
valley
soldiers
had
already
given
proof
of
their
stubborn
qualities
on
the
defensive
the
sight
of
their
baptismal
and
the
memories
of
bull
run
must
have
gone
far
to
nerve
the
hearts
of
the
stonewall
regiments
and
in
preparing
once
more
to
justify
their
proud
title
the
troops

the

issued
the
troops
were
merely
to
hold
their
ground
no
general
counterstroke
was
intended
and
the
divisional
commanders
were
to
confine
themselves
to
repulsing
the
attack
the
time
for
a
strong
offensive
return
had
not
yet
come
the
enemy
advanced
slowly
in
imposing
masses
shortly
after
seven
hidden
to
some
extent
by
the
woods
four
divisions
of
infantry
deployed
in
several
lines
at
the
foot
of
the
henry
hill
and
their
skirmishers
became
engaged
with
the
confederate
pickets
at
the
same
moment
three
batteries
came
into
action
on
a
rise
of
groveton
opposite
the
confederate
centre
and
sigel
supported
by
reynolds
prepared
to
carry
out
his
instructions
and
hold
jackson
until
the
remainder
of
pope
army
should
arrive
upon
the
field
at
the
end
of
july
sigel
army
corps
had
numbered
men
allowing
for
stragglers
and
for
casualties
on
the
rappahannock
where
it
had
been
several
times
engaged
it
must
still
have
mustered
it
was
accompanied
by
ten
batteries
and
reynolds
division
was
composed
of
infantry
and
four
batteries
the
attack
was
thus
no
stronger
than
the
defence
and
as
the
federal
artillery
positions
were
restricted
by
the
woods
there
could
be
little
doubt
of
the
result
in
other
respects
moreover
the
combatants
were
not
evenly
matched
reynolds
pennsylvanians
were
fine
troops
already
seasoned
in
the
battles
on
the
peninsula
and
commanded
by
such
officers
as
meade
and
seymour
but
sigel
who
had
been
an
officer
in
the
baden
army
had
succeeded
fremont
and
his
corps
was
composed
of
those
same
germans
whom
ewell
had
used
so
hardly
at
cross
keys
many
of
them
were
old
soldiers
who
had
borne
arms
in
europe
but
the
stern
discipline
and
trained
officers
of
conscript
armies
were
lacking
in
america
and
the
confederate
volunteers
had
little
respect
for
these
foreign
levies
nor
were
sigel
dispositions
a
brilliant
example
of
offensive
tactics
his
three
divisions
schurz
schenck
and
steinwehr
supported
by
milroy
independent
brigade
advanced
to
the
attack
along
a
wide
front
schurz
with
two
brigades
moving
into
the
groveton
wood
assailed
the
confederate
left
while
milroy
and
schenck
advanced
over
the
open
meadows
which
lay
in
front
of
the
right
steinwehr
was
in
reserve
and
reynolds
somewhat
to
the
rear
moved
forward
on
the
extreme
left
the
line
was
more
than
two
miles
long
the
artillery
hampered
by
the
ground
could
render
but
small
assistance
and
at
no
single
point
were
the
troops
disposed
in
sufficient
depth
to
break
through
the
front
of
the
defence
the
attack
too
was
piecemeal
advancing
through
the
wood
division
was
at
once
met
by
a
sharp
counterstroke
delivered
by
the
left
brigade
gregg
south
carolina
of
hill
division
which
drove
the
two
federal
brigades
apart
reinforcements
were
sent
in
by
milroy
who
had
been
checked
on
the
open
ground
by
the
heavy
fire
of
jackson
guns
and
the
germans
rallied
but
after
some
hard
fighting
a
fresh
counterstroke
in
which
thomas
brigade
took
part
drove
them
in
disorder
from
the
wood
and
the
south
carolinians
following
to
the
edge
poured
heavy
volleys
into
their
retreating
masses
schenck
meanwhile
deterred
by
the
batteries
on
right
had
remained
inactive
the
federal
artillery
such
as
had
been
brought
into
action
had
produced
no
effect
reynolds
who
had
a
difficult
march
had
not
yet
come
into
action
and
in
order
to
support
the
broken
troops
schenck
was
now
ordered
to
close
in
upon
the
right
but
the
opportunity
had
already
passed
it
was
now
and
jackson
had
long
since
learned
that
lee
was
near
at
hand
longstreet
advanced
guard
had
passed
through
gainesville
and
the
main
body
was
closing
up
not
only
had
time
been
gained
but
two
brigades
alone
had
proved
sufficient
to
hold
the
enemy
at
arm
length
and
the
rough
counterstrokes
had
disconcerted
the
order
of
attack
a
fresh
federal
force
however
was
already
approaching
the
troops
from
centreville
comprising
the
divisions
of
hooker
kearney
and
reno
or
men
were
hurrying
over
the
stone
bridge
and
a
second
and
more
vigorous
attack
was
now
to
be
withstood
sigel
too
was
still
capable
of
further
effort
bringing
up
steinwehr
division
and
demanding
reinforcements
from
reno
he
threw
his
whole
force
against
the
confederate
front
schenck
however
still
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
massed
artillery
was
unable
to
advance
and
milroy
in
the
centre
was
hurled
back
but
through
the
wood
the
attack
was
vigorously
pressed
and
the
fight
raged
fiercely
at
close
quarters
along
the
railway
between
and
thomas
brigades
a
gap
of
over
a
hundred
yards
as
the
men
closed
in
upon
the
centre
had
gradually
opened
opposite
the
gap
was
a
deep
cutting
and
the
federals
covered
by
the
wood
massed
here
unobserved
in
heavy
force
attack
from
this
quarter
was
unexpected
and
for
a
moment
hill
first
line
was
in
jeopardy
gregg
however
had
still
a
regiment
in
second
line
and
throwing
it
quickly
forward
he
drove
the
enemy
across
the
railroad
then
hill
bringing
up
branch
from
the
third
line
sent
this
fresh
brigade
to
gregg
support
and
cleared
the
front
the
germans
had
now
been
finally
disposed
of
but
although
longstreet
had
arrived
upon
the
ground
and
was
deploying
in
the
woods
on
jackson
right
thus
relieving
early
who
at
once
marched
to
support
the
centre
jackson
men
had
not
yet
finished
with
the
enemy
pope
had
now
taken
over
command
and
besides
the
troops
from
centreville
who
had
already
reached
the
field
mcdowell
and
porter
with
men
were
coming
up
from
manassas
and
reynolds
had
not
yet
been
engaged
but
it
is
one
thing
to
assemble
large
numbers
on
the
another
to
give
them
the
right
direction
in
the
direction
of
gainesville
high
woods
and
rolling
ridges
had
concealed
longstreet
approach
and
the
federal
patrols
had
been
everywhere
held
in
check
by
stuart
squadrons
in
ignorance
therefore
that
the
whole
confederate
army
was
concentrated
before
him
pope
anticipating
an
easy
victory
determined
to
sweep
jackson
from
the
field
but
it
was
first
necessary
to
relieve
sigel
kearney
division
had
already
deployed
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
federal
line
resting
on
bull
run
hooker
was
on
the
left
of
kearney
and
a
brigade
of
reno
on
the
left
of
hooker
while
sigel
assembled
his
shattered
forces
these
fresh
troops
led
by
some
of
the
best
officers
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
were
ordered
to
advance
against
hill
reynolds
under
the
impression
that
he
was
fighting
jackson
was
already
in
collision
with
and
mcdowell
and
porter
marching
along
the
railway
from
manassas
might
be
expected
to
strike
the
confederate
right
rear
at
any
moment
it
was
then
with
good
hope
of
victory
that
pope
rode
along
his
line
and
explained
the
situation
to
his
generals
map
of
positions
on
august
but
the
fresh
attack
was
made
with
no
better
concert
than
those
which
preceded
it
kearney
on
the
right
near
bull
run
was
held
at
bay
by
jackson
guns
and
hooker
and
reno
advanced
alone
as
the
federals
moved
forward
the
grey
skirmishers
fell
back
through
the
groveton
wood
and
scarcely
had
they
reached
the
railroad
before
the
long
blue
lines
came
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
riflemen
lying
down
to
load
and
rising
only
to
fire
poured
in
their
deadly
volleys
at
range
the
storm
of
bullets
shredding
leaves
and
twigs
stripped
the
trees
of
their
verdure
and
the
long
dry
grass
ignited
by
the
powder
sparks
burst
into
flames
between
the
opposing
lines
but
neither
flames
nor
musketry
availed
to
stop
hooker
onset
bayonets
flashed
through
the
smoke
and
a
gallant
rush
placed
the
stormers
on
the
embankment
the
confederates
reeled
back
in
confusion
and
men
crowded
round
the
colours
to
protect
them
but
assistance
was
at
hand
a
fierce
yell
and
a
heavy
volley
and
the
regiments
of
the
second
line
surged
forward
driving
back
the
intruders
and
closing
the
breach
yet
the
federal
ranks
reformed
the
wood
rang
with
cheers
and
a
fresh
brigade
advanced
to
the
assault
again
the
parapet
was
carried
again
the
southern
bayonets
cleared
the
front
hooker
leading
brigade
abandoning
the
edge
of
the
wood
had
already
given
ground
reno
regiments
suffering
fearful
slaughter
with
difficulty
maintained
their
place
and
hill
calling
once
more
upon
his
reserves
sent
in
pender
to
the
counterstroke
passing
by
the
right
of
thomas
who
with
field
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
last
attack
pender
crossed
the
railroad
and
charged
into
the
wood
many
of
the
men
in
the
joined
in
the
onward
movement
the
federals
were
borne
back
the
brigades
in
rear
were
swept
away
by
the
tide
of
fugitives
the
wood
was
cleared
and
a
battery
near
by
was
deserted
by
the
gunners
then
pender
received
with
a
heavy
artillery
fire
from
the
opposite
heights
moved
boldly
forward
across
the
open
but
the
counterstroke
had
been
pushed
too
far
the
line
faltered
hostile
infantry
appeared
on
either
flank
and
as
the
confederates
fell
back
to
the
railroad
the
enemy
came
forward
in
pursuit
grover
brigade
of
division
had
hitherto
been
held
in
reserve
sheltered
by
a
roll
of
the
land
opposite
that
portion
of
the
front
which
was
held
by
thomas
it
was
now
directed
to
attack
move
slowly
forward
were
the
orders
which
grover
gave
to
his
command
until
the
enemy
opens
fire
then
advance
rapidly
give
them
one
volley
and
then
the
bayonet
the
five
regiments
moved
steadily
through
the
wood
in
a
single
line
when
they
reached
the
edge
they
saw
immediately
before
them
the
red
earth
of
the
embankment
at
this
point
ten
feet
high
and
lined
with
riflemen
there
was
a
crash
of
fire
a
swift
rush
through
the
rolling
smoke
and
the
federals
crossing
the
parapet
swept
all
before
them
hill
second
line
received
them
with
a
scattered
fire
turned
in
confusion
and
fled
back
upon
the
guns
then
beckoned
victory
to
him
who
had
held
his
reserves
in
hand
jackson
had
seen
the
charge
and
forno
louisianians
with
a
regiment
of
lawton
had
already
been
sent
forward
with
the
bayonet
in
close
order
the
counterstroke
came
on
the
thinned
ranks
of
the
federals
could
oppose
no
resolute
resistance
fighting
they
fell
back
first
to
the
embankment
where
for
a
few
moments
they
held
their
own
and
then
to
the
wood
but
without
supports
it
was
impossible
to
rally
johnson
and
starke
brigades
swept
down
upon
their
flank
the
louisianians
supported
by
field
and
archer
against
their
front
and
in
twenty
minutes
with
a
loss
of
his
numbers
grover
in
his
turn
was
driven
beyond
the
warrenton
turnpike
four
divisions
schurz
steinwehr
hooker
and
reno
had
been
hurled
in
succession
against
jackson
front
their
losses
had
been
enormous
grover
brigade
had
lost
out
of
of
which
one
regiment
strong
accounted
for
officers
and
men
three
regiments
of
reno
lost
and
it
is
probable
that
more
than
men
had
fallen
in
the
wood
which
lay
in
front
of
hill
brigades
the
fighting
however
had
not
been
without
effect
on
the
confederates
the
charges
to
which
they
had
been
exposed
impetuous
as
they
were
were
doubtless
less
trying
than
a
sustained
attack
pressed
on
by
continuous
waves
of
fresh
troops
and
allowing
the
defence
no
breathing
space
such
steady
pressure
always
increasing
in
strength
saps
the
morale
more
rapidly
than
a
series
of
fierce
assaults
delivered
at
wide
intervals
of
time
but
such
pressure
implies
on
the
part
of
the
assailant
an
accumulation
of
superior
force
and
this
accumulation
the
enemy
generals
had
not
attempted
to
provide
in
none
of
the
four
attacks
which
had
shivered
against
hill
front
had
the
strength
of
the
assailants
been
greater
than
that
of
his
own
division
and
to
the
tremendous
weight
of
such
a
stroke
as
had
won
the
battles
of
gaines
mill
or
cedar
run
to
the
closely
combined
advance
of
overwhelming
numbers
jackson
men
had
not
yet
been
subjected
the
battle
nevertheless
had
been
fiercely
contested
and
the
strain
of
constant
vigilance
and
fighting
had
told
on
the
light
division
the
federal
skirmishers
boldly
advancing
as
pender
men
fell
back
had
once
more
filled
the
wood
and
their
venomous
fire
allowed
the
defenders
no
leisure
for
repose
the
federal
sharpshooters
at
this
time
says
colonel
mccrady
of
the
light
division
held
possession
of
the
wood
and
kept
up
a
deadly
fire
of
single
shots
whenever
any
one
of
us
was
exposed
every
lieutenant
who
had
to
change
position
did
so
at
the
risk
of
his
life
what
was
my
horror
during
an
interval
in
the
attack
to
see
general
jackson
himself
walking
quickly
down
the
railroad
cut
examining
our
position
and
calmly
looking
into
the
wood
that
concealed
the
enemy
strange
to
say
he
was
not
molested
southern
historical
society

ammunition
had
already
given
out
many
of
the
men
had
but
two
or
three
cartridges
remaining
and
the
volunteers
who
ran
the
gauntlet
to
procure
fresh
supplies
were
many
of
them
shot
down
moreover
nine
hours
fighting
much
of
it
at
close
range
had
piled
the
corpses
thick
upon
the
railroad
and
the
ranks
of
brigades
were
terribly
attenuated
the
second
line
had
already
been
brought
up
to
fill
the
gaps
and
every
brigade
had
been
heavily
engaged
it
was
about
four
and
for
a
short
space
the
pressure
on
the
confederate
lines
relaxed
the
continuous
roar
of
the
artillery
dwindled
to
a
fitful
cannonade
and
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
drooping
under
the
heat
where
the
foliage
was
white
with
the
dust
of
battle
the
skirmishers
let
their
rifles
cool
but
the
valley
soldiers
knew
that
their
respite
would
be
short
the
federal
masses
were
still
marching
and
on
the
opposite
hills
from
the
forest
beyond
long
columns
streamed
steadily
to
the
front
and
near
the
warrenton
turnpike
fresh
batteries
were
coming
into
action
pope
had
ordered
kearney
and
reno
to
make
a
fresh
attack
the
former
one
of
the
most
dashing
officers
in
the
federal
army
disposed
his
division
in
two
lines
reno
in
the
same
formation
deployed
upon
kearney
right
and
with
their
flank
resting
on
bull
run
the
five
brigades
went
forward
to
the
charge
the
confederate
batteries
posted
on
the
ridge
in
rear
swept
the
open
ground
along
the
stream
but
regardless
of
their
fire
the
federals
came
rapidly
to
close
quarters
and
seized
the
railroad
when
hill
saw
this
formidable
storm
bursting
on
his
lines
he
felt
that
the
supreme
moment
had
arrived
would
gregg
on
whose
front
the
division
of
reno
was
bearing
down
be
able
to
hold
his
own
that
gallant
soldier
although
more
than
one
half
of
his
command
lay
dead
or
wounded
replied
in
answer
to
his
chief
enquiry
that
his
ammunition
was
almost
expended
but
that
he
had
still
the
bayonet
nevertheless
the
pressure
was
too
heavy
for
his
wearied
troops
foot
by
foot
they
were
forced
back
and
at
the
same
moment
thomas
field
and
branch
still
fighting
desperately
were
compelled
to
yield
their
ground
hill
anxiously
looking
for
succour

already
called
on
early
the
enemy
swarming
across
the
railroad
had
penetrated
to
a
point
three
hundred
yards
within
the
confederate
position
but
the
grey
line
was
not
yet
shattered
the
men
of
the
light
division
though
borne
backwards
by
the
rush
still
faced
towards
the
foe
and
early
brigade
supported
by
two
regiments
of

division
advanced
with
levelled
bayonets
drove
through
the
tumult
and
opposed
a
solid

to
the
crowd
of

once
more
the
fresh
reserve
thrown
in
at
the
propitious
moment
swept
back
numbers
far
superior
to
itself
once
more
order
prevailed
over
disorder
and
the
cold
steel
asserted
its
supremacy
the
strength
of
the
assailants
was
already
spent
the
wave
receded
more
swiftly
than
it
had
risen
and
through
the
copses
and
across
the
railroad
the
confederates
drove
their
exhausted
foe
general
hill
had
instructed
early
that
he
was
not
to
pass
beyond
the
original
front
but
it
was
impossible
to
restrain
the
troops
and
not
till
they
had
advanced
several
hundred
yards
was
the
brigade
halted
and
brought
back
the
counterstroke
was

preceded
it
early
losses
were
comparatively
slight
those
inflicted
on
the
enemy
very
heavy
and
hill

were
finally
relieved
pope
abandoned
all
further
efforts
to
crush

five
assaults
had
failed
infantry
had
charged
in
vain
through
the
fatal
wood
and
of
the
federal
casualties
reported
on
this
day
by
far
the
larger
proportion
was
due
to
the
deadly
fire
and
dashing
counterstrokes
of
jackson
infantry
while
pope
was
hurling
division
after
division
against
the
confederate
left
lee
with
longstreet
at
his
side
observed
the
conflict
from
stuart
hill
the
wooded
eminence
which
stands
of
groveton
on
this
wing
though
a
mile
distant
from
jackson
battle
both
federals
and
confederates
were
in
force
at
least
one
half
of
pope
army
had
gradually
assembled
on
this
flank
here
were
reynolds
and
mcdowell
and
on
the
manassas
road
stood
two
divisions
under
porter
within
the
woods
on
stuart
hill
with
the
cavalry
on
his
flank
longstreet
had
deployed
his
whole
force
with
the
exception
of
anderson
who
had
not
yet
passed
thoroughfare
gap
but
although
both
pope
and
lee
were
anxious
to
engage
neither
could
bring
their
subordinates
to
the
point
pope
had
sent
vague
instructions
to
porter
and
mcdowell
and
when
at
length
he
had
substituted
a
definite
order
it
was
not
only
late
in
arriving
but
the
generals
found
that
it
was
based
on
an
absolutely
incorrect
view
of
the
situation
the
federal
commander
had
no
knowledge
that
longstreet
with
men
was
already
in
position
beyond
his
left
so
close
lay
the
confederates
that
under
the
impression
that
stuart
hill
was
still
untenanted
he
desired
porter
to
move
across
it
and
envelop
jackson
right
porter
suspecting
that
the
main
body
of
the
southern
army
was
before
him
declined
to
risk
his
men
until
he
had
reported
the
true
state
of
affairs
a
peremptory
reply
to
attack
at
once
was
received
at
but
it
was
then
too
late
to
intervene
nor
had
lee
been
more
successful
in
developing
a
counterstroke
longstreet
with
a
complacency
it
is
difficult
to
understand
has
related
how
he
opposed
the
wishes
of
the
three
times
lee
urged
him
forward
the
first
time
he
rode
to
the
front
to
reconnoitre
and
found
that
the
position
in
his
own
words
was
not
inviting
again
lee
insisted
that
the
enemy
left
might
be
turned
while
the
question
was
under
discussion
a
heavy
force
porter
and
mcdowell
was
reported
advancing
from
manassas
junction
no
attack
followed
however
and
lee
repeated
his
instructions
longstreet
was
still
unwilling
a
large
portion
of
the
federal
force
on
the
manassas
road
now
marched
northward
to
join
pope
and
lee
for
the
last
time
bade
longstreet
attack
towards
groveton
i
suggested
says
the
latter
that
the
day
being
far
spent
it
might
be
as
well
to
advance
before
night
on
a
forced
reconnaissance
get
our
troops
into
the
most
favourable
positions
and
have
all
things
ready
for
battle
the
next
morning
to
this
general
lee
reluctantly
gave
consent
and
orders
were
given
for
an
advance
to
be
pursued
under
cover
of
night
until
the
main
position
could
be
carefully
examined
it
so
happened
that
an
order
to
advance
was
issued
on
the
other
side
at
the
same
time
so
that
the
encounter
was
something
of
a
surprise

both
sides

of

the
long
line
of
on
the
heights
above

and
the
frequent
skirmishes
along
the

told
general
lee
that
his
enemy
had
no
intention
of
falling
back
behind
the
stream
and
when
morning
broke
the
federal
troops
were
observed
upon
every
ridge
august
the
confederate
leader
eager
as
he
had
been
to
force
the
battle
to
an
issue
on
the
previous
afternoon
had
now
abandoned
all
idea
of
attack
the
respite
which
the
enemy
had
gained
might
have
altogether
changed
the
situation
it
was
possible
that
the
federals
had
been
largely
reinforced
pope
and
mcclellan
had
been
given
time
and
the
hours
of
the
night
might
have
been
utilised
to
bring
up
the
remainder
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
lee
resolved
therefore
to
await
events
the
federal
position
was
strong
their
masses
were
well
concentrated
there
was
ample
space
on
the
ridges
beyond
young
branch
for
the
deployment
of
their
numerous
artillery
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
outflank
them
moreover
a
contingent
of
fresh
troops
from
richmond
the
divisions
of
hill
mclaws
and
walker
together
with
hampton

in
all

total
until
this
force
should
join
him
he
determined
to
postpone
further
manoeuvres
and
to
rest
his
army
but
he
was
not
without
hope
that
pope
might
assume
the
initiative
and
move
down
from
the
heights
on
which
his
columns
were
already
forming
aware
of
the
sanguine
and
impatient
temper
of
his
adversary
confident
in
the
morale
of
his
troops
and
in
the
strength
of
his
position
he
foresaw
that
an
opportunity
might
offer
for
an
overwhelming
counterstroke
map
meanwhile
the
confederate
divisions
still
hidden
in
the
woods
lay
quietly
on
their
arms
few
changes
were
made
in
the
dispositions
of
the
previous
day
jackson
despite
his
losses
had
made
no
demand
for
reinforcements
and
the
only
direct
support
afforded
him
was
a
battery
of
eighteen
guns
drawn
from
the
battalion
of
colonel
lee
and
established
on
the
high
ground
west
of
the
douglass
house
at
right
angles
to
his
line
of
battle
these
guns
pointing
overlooked
the
wide
tract
of
undulating
meadow
which
lay
in
front
of
the
stonewall
and
lawton
divisions
and
they
commanded
a
field
of
fire
over
a
mile
long
the
left
of
the
battery
was
not
far
distant
from
the
guns
on
jackson
right
and
the
whole
of
the
open
space
was
thus
exposed
to
the
of
a
formidable
artillery
to
the
right
of
the
batteries
stuart
hill
was
strongly
occupied
by
longstreet
with
anderson
division
as
general
reserve
and
this
wing
of
the
confederate
army
was
gradually
wheeled
up
but
always
under
cover
until
it
was
almost
perpendicular
to
the
line
of
the
unfinished
railroad
the
strength
of
lee
army
at
the
battle
of
manassas
was
hardly
more
than
of
all
arms
jackson
command
had
been
reduced
by
battle
and
forced
marches
to
men
longstreet
mustered
and
the
cavalry
hood
texans
had
a
hymn
which
graphically
expressed
this
truism
the
race
is
not
to
him
that
got
the
longest
legs
to
run
nor
the
battle
to
those
people
that
shoot
the
biggest
gun
but
numbers
are
of
less
importance
than
the
confidence
of
the
men
in
their
ability
to
conquer
and
the
spirit
of
the
confederates
had
been
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
the
keen
critics
in
ranks
although
they
had
taken
no
part
in
the
manassas
raid
or
in
the
battles
of
august
and
fully
appreciated
the
daring
strategy
which
had
brought
them
within
two
short
marches
of
washington
the
junction
of
the
two
wings
in
the
very
presence
of
the
enemy
after
many
days
of
separation
was
a
manoeuvre
after
their
own
hearts
the
passage
of
thoroughfare
gap
revealed
the
difficulties
which
had
attended
the
operations
and
the
manner
in
which
the
enemy
had
been
outwitted
appealed
with
peculiar
force
to
their
quick
intelligence
their
trust
in
lee
was
higher
than
ever
and
the
story
of
jackson
march
of
the
capture
of
manassas
of
the
repulse
of
pope
army
if
it
increased
their
contempt
for
the
enemy
inspired
them
with
an
enthusiastic
determination
to
emulate
the
achievements
of
their
comrades
the
soldiers
of
the
valley
army
who
unaided
by
a
single
bayonet
had
withstood
the
five
successive
assaults
which
had
been
launched
against
their
position
were
supremely
indifferent
now
longstreet
was
in
line
to
whatever
the
enemy
might
attempt
it
was
noticed
that
notwithstanding
the
heavy
losses
they
had
experienced
jackson
troops
were
never
more
than
on
the
morning
of
august
had
been
replenished
rations
had
been
issued
and
for
several
hours
the
men
had
been
called
on
neither
to
march
nor
fight
as
they
lay
in
the
woods
and
the
pickets
firing
on
the
enemy
patrols
kept
up
a
constant
skirmish
to
the
front
the
laugh
and
jest
ran
down
the
ranks
and
the
unfortunate
pope
who
had
only
seen
the
backs
of
his
enemies
served
as
whetstone
for
their
wit
by
the
troops
who
had
revelled
in
the
spoils
of
winchester
banks
had
been
dubbed
old
jack
commissary
general
by
universal
acclamation
after
the
manassas
foray
pope
was
promoted
to
the
same
distinction
and
had
it
been
possible
to
penetrate
to
the
federal
headquarters
the
mirth
of
those
ragged
privates
would
hardly
have
diminished
pope
was
in
an
excellent
humour
conversing
affably
with
his
staff
and
viewing
with
pride
the
martial
aspect
of
his
massed
divisions
nearly
his
whole
force
was
concentrated
on
the
hills
around
him
and
porter
who
had
been
called
up
from
the
manassas
road
was
already
marching
northwards
through
the
woods
banks
still
was
absent
at
bristoe
station
in
charge
of
the
trains
and
stores
which
had
been
removed
from
warrenton
but
shortly
after
ten
men
with
batteries
were
at
pope
disposal
he
had
determined
to
give
battle
although
franklin
and
sumner
who
had
already
reached
alexandria
had
not
yet
joined
him
and
he
anticipated
an
easy
triumph
he
was
labouring
however
under
an
extraordinary
delusion
the
retreat
of
hood
brigades
the
preceding
night
after
their
reconnaissance
had
induced
him
to
believe
that
jackson
had
been
defeated
and
he
had
reported
to
halleck
at
daybreak
we
fought
a
terrific
battle
here
yesterday
with
the
combined
forces
of
the
enemy
which
lasted
with
continuous
fury
from
daylight
until
dark
by
which
time
the
enemy
was
driven
from
the
field
which
we
now
occupy
the
enemy
is
still
in
our
front
but
badly
used
up
we
lost
not
less
than
men
killed
and
wounded
but
from
the
appearance
of
the
field
the
enemy
lost
at
least
two
to
one
the
news
has
just
reached
me
from
the
front
that
the
enemy
is
retreating
towards
the
mountains
if
in
these
days
of
weapons
napoleon
dictum
still
stands
good
that
the
general
who
is
ignorant
of
his
enemy
strength
and
dispositions
is
ignorant
of
his
trade
then
of
all
generals
pope
was
surely
the
most
incompetent
at
ten
on
the
morning
of
august
and
for
many
months
afterwards
despite
his
statement
that
he
had
fought
the
combined
forces
of
the
enemy
on
the
previous
day
he
was
still
under
the
impression
so
skilfully
were
the
confederate
troops
concealed
that
longstreet
had
not
yet
joined
jackson
and
that
the
latter
was
gradually
falling
back
on
thoroughfare
gap
his
patrols
had
reported
that
the
enemy
cavalry
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
left
bank
of
bull
run
a
small
reconnaissance
in
force
sent
to
test
jackson
strength
had
ascertained
that
the
extreme
left
was
not
so
far
forward
as
it
had
been
yesterday
while
two
of
the
federal
generals
reconnoitring
beyond
the
turnpike
observed
only
a
few
skirmishers
on
these
negative
reports
pope
based
his
decision
to
seize
the
ridge
which
was
held
by
jackson
yet
the
woods
along
the
unfinished
railroad
had
not
been
examined
and
the
information
from
other
sources
was
of
a
different
colour
and
more
positive
cavalry
had
reported
on
the
evening
of
the
that
a
large
force
had
passed
through
thoroughfare
gap
porter
declared
that
the
enemy
was
in
great
strength
on
the
manassas
road
reynolds
who
had
been
in
close
contact
with
longstreet
since
the
previous
afternoon
reported
that
stuart
hill
was
strongly
occupied
ricketts
moreover
who
had
fought
longstreet
for
many
hours
at
thoroughfare
gap
was
actually
present
on
the
field
but
pope
who
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
enemy
ought
to
retreat
and
that
therefore
he
must
retreat
refused
credence
to
any
report
whatever
which
ran
counter
to
these
preconceived
ideas
noon
without
making
the
slightest
attempt
to
verify
by
personal
observation
the
conclusions
at
which
his
subordinates
had
arrived
at
midday
to
the
dismay
of
his
best
officers
his
army
being
now
in
position
he
issued
orders
for
his
troops
to
be
immediately
thrown
forward
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
to
press
him
vigorously
porter
and
reynolds
formed
the
left
of
the
federal
army
these
generals
alive
to
the
necessity
of
examining
the
woods
deployed
a
strong
skirmish
line
before
them
as
they
formed
for
action
further
evidence
of
pope
hallucination
was
at
once
forthcoming
the
moment
reynolds
moved
forward
against
stuart
hill
he
found
his
front
overlapped
by
long
lines
of
infantry
and
riding
back
he
informed
pope
that
in
so
doing
he
had
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
skirmishers
who
threatened
his
rear
porter
too
pushing
his
reconnaissance
across
the
meadows
west
of
groveton
drew
the
fire
of
several
batteries
but
at
this
juncture
unfortunately
for
the
federals
a
union
prisoner
recaptured
from
jackson
declared
that
he
had
heard
the
rebel
officers
say
that
their
army
was
retiring
to
unite
with
longstreet
so
positively
did
the
indications
before
him
contradict
this
statement
that
porter
on
sending
the
man
to
pope
wrote
in
duty
bound
i
send
him
but
i
regard
him
as
either
a
fool
or
designedly
released
to
give
a
wrong
impression
no
faith
should
be
put
in
what
he
says
if
jackson
employed
this
man
to
delude
his
enemy
the
ruse
was
eminently
successful
porter
received
the
reply
general
pope
believes
that
soldier
and
directs
you
to
attack
reynolds
was
dismissed
with
a
message
that
cavalry
would
be
sent
to
verify
his
report
and
mcdowell
was
ordered
to
put
in
the
divisions
of
hatch
and
ricketts
on
porter
right
during
the
whole
morning
the
attention
of
the
confederates
had
been
directed
to
the
groveton
wood
beyond
the
timber
rose
the
hill
and
on
this
hill
three
or
four
federal
batteries
had
come
into
action
at
an
early
hour
firing
at
intervals
across
the
meadows
the
confederate
guns
save
when
the
enemy
skirmishers
approached
too
close
hardly
deigned
to
reply
reserving
their
ammunition
for
warmer
work
that
such
work
was
to
come
was
hardly
doubtful
troops
had
been
constantly
in
motion
near
the
hostile
batteries
and
the
thickets
below
were
evidently
full
of
men
shortly
after
noon
the
enemy
skirmishers
became
aggressive
swarming
over
the
meadows
and
into
the
wood
which
had
seen
such
heavy
slaughter
in
the
fight
of
yesterday
as
jackson
pickets
extended
over
a
wide
front
gave
slowly
back
his
guns
opened
in
earnest
and
shell
and
shrapnel
flew
fast
over
the
open
space
the
strong
force
of
skirmishers
betrayed
the
presence
of
a
line
of
battle
not
far
in
rear
and
ignoring
the
fire
of
the
artillery
the
confederate
batteries
concentrated
on
the
covert
behind
which
they
knew
the
enemy
masses
were
forming
for
attack
but
except
the
pickets
not
a
single
man
of
either
the
stonewall
or
division
was
permitted
to
expose
himself
a
few
companies
held
the
railroad
the
remainder
were
carefully
concealed
the
storm
was
not
long
in
breaking
jackson
had
just
ridden
along
his
lines
examining
with
his
own
eyes
the
stir
in
the
groveton
wood
when
in
rear
of
the
skirmishers
advancing
over
the
highroad
appeared
the
serried
ranks
of
the
line
of
battle
bayonets
on
a
front
which
extended
from
groveton
to
near
bull
run
swept
forward
against
his
front
formed
in
dense
masses
on
the
slopes
in
rear
stood
in
readiness
to
support
them
and
numerous
batteries
coming
into
action
on
every
rising
ground
covered
the
advance
with
a
heavy
fire
pope
standing
on
a
knoll
near
the
stone
house
saw
victory
within
his
grasp
the
confederate
guns
had
been
pointed
out
to
his
troops
as
the
objective
of
the
attack
unsupported
as
he
believed
save
by
the
scattered
groups
of
skirmishers
who
were
already
retreating
to
the
railroad
and
assailed
in
front
and
flank
these
batteries
he
expected
would
soon
be
flying
to
the
rear
and
the
federal
army
in
possession
of
the
high
ground
would
then
sweep
down
in
heavy
columns
towards
thoroughfare
gap
suddenly
his
hopes
fell
porter
masses
stretching
far
to
right
and
left
had
already
passed
the
dogan
house
hatch
was
entering
the
groveton
wood
ricketts
was
moving
forward
along
bull
run
and
the
way
seemed
clear
before
them
when
loud
and
clear
above
the
roar
of
the
artillery
rang
out
the
confederate
bugles
and
along
the
whole
length
of
the
ridge
beyond
the
railroad
long
lines
of
infantry
streaming
forward
from
the
woods
ran
down
to
the
embankment
the
effect
said
an
officer
who
witnessed
this
unexpected
apparition
was
not
unlike
flushing
a
covey
of
quails
instead
of
the
small
which
pope
had
thought
to
crush
by
sheer
force
of
overwhelming
numbers
the
whole
of
the
stonewall
division
with
lawton
on
the
left
stood
across
porter
path
reynolds
south
of
the
turnpike
and
confronting

immediately
ordered
to
fall
back
and
support
the
attack
and
two
small
brigades
warren
and
alexander
were
left
alone
on
the
federal
left
pope
had
committed
his
last
and
his
worst
blunder
sigel
with
two
divisions
was
in
rear
of
porter
and
for
assistance
porter
had
already
asked
but
pope
still
under
the
delusion
that
longstreet
was
not
yet
up
preferred
rather
to
weaken
his
left
than
grant
the
request
of
a
subordinate
under
such
a
leader
the
courage
of
the
troops
however
vehement
was
of
no
avail
and
in
porter
attack
the
soldiers
displayed
a
courage
to
which
the
confederates
paid
a
willing
tribute
morell

with
the
two
brigades
abreast
arrayed
in

lines

in

to

the

of

moved
forward
under
sykes
map
of
the
approximate
positions
in
the
attack
on
jackson
august
morell
attack
was
directed
against
jackson
right
in
the
centre
of
the
federal
line
a
mounted
officer
whose
gallant
bearing
lived
long
in
the
memories
of
the
stonewall
division
rode
out
in
front
of
the
column
and
drawing
his
sabre
led
the
advance
over
the
rolling
the
confederate
batteries
with
a
terrible
swept
the
northern
ranks
from
end
to
end
the
volley
of
the
infantry
lying
behind
their
parapet
struck
them
full
in
face
but
the
horse
and
his
rider
lived
through
it
all
the
men
followed
close
charging
swiftly
up
the
slope
and
then
the
leader
putting
his
horse
straight
at
the
embankment
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
top
the
daring
feat
was
seen
by
the
whole
confederate
line
and
a
yell
went
up
from
the
men
along
the
railroad
do
kill
him
do
kill
him
but
while
the
cry
went
up
horse
and
rider
fell
in
one
limp
mass
across
the
earthwork
and
the
gallant
northerner
was
dragged
under
shelter
by
his
generous
foes
with
such
men
as
this
to
show
the
way
what
soldiers
would
be
backward
as
the
russians
followed
skobeleff
grey
up
the
bloody
slopes
of
plevna
so
the
federals
followed
the
bright
chestnut
of
this
unknown
hero
and
not
till
the
colours
waved
within
thirty
paces
of
the
parapet
did
the
charge
falter
but
despite
the
supports
that
came
thronging
up
jackson
soldiers
covered
by
the
earthwork
opposed
a
resistance
which
no
mere
frontal
attack
could
break
three
times
as
the
lines
in
rear
merged
with
the
first
the
federal
officers
brought
their
men
forward
to
the
assault
and
three
times
were
they
hurled
back
leaving
hundreds
of
their
number
dead
and
wounded
on
the
turf
one
regiment
of
the
stonewall
division
posted
in
a
copse
beyond
the
railroad
was
driven
in
but
others
when
cartridges
failed
them
had
recourse
like
the
guards
at
inkermann
to
the
stones
which
lay
along
the
and
with
these
strange
weapons
backed
up
by
the
bayonet
more
than
one
desperate
effort
was
repulsed
in
arresting
garnett
after
kernstown
because
when
his
ammunition
was
exhausted
he
had
abandoned
his
position
jackson
had
lost
a
good
general
but
he
had
taught
his
soldiers
a
useful
lesson
so
long
as
the
cold
steel
was
left
to
them
and
their
flanks
were
safe
they
knew
that
their
indomitable
leader
expected
them
to
hold
their
ground
and
right
gallantly
they
responded
for
over
thirty
minutes
the
battle
raged
along
the
front
at
the
closest
range
opposite
a
deep
cutting
the
colours
of
a
federal
regiment
for
nearly
half
an
hour
rose
and
fell
as
bearer
after
bearer
was
shot
down
within
ten
yards
of
the
muzzles
of
the
confederate
rifles
and
after
the
fight
a
hundred
dead
northerners
were
found
where
the
flag
had
been
so
gallantly
upheld
hill
meanwhile
was
heavily
engaged
with
hatch
every
brigade
with
the
exception
of
gregg
had
been
thrown
into
the
and
so
hardly
were
they
pressed
that
jackson
turning
to
his
signallers
demanded
reinforcements
from
his
colleague
longstreet
in
response
to
the
call
ordered
two
more
batteries
to
join
colonel
stephen
lee
and
morell
division
penned
in
that
deadly
cockpit
between
hill
and
the
groveton
wood
shattered
by
musketry
in
front
and
by
artillery
at
short
range
in
flank
fell
back
across
the
meadows
hatch
soon
followed
suit
and
jackson
artillery
which
during
the
fight
at
close
quarters
had
turned
its
fire
on
the
supports
launched
a
storm
of
shell
on
the
defeated
federals
some
batteries
were
ordered
to
change
position
so
as
to
rake
their
lines
and
the
stonewall
division
reinforced
by
a
brigade
of
hill
was
sent
forward
to
the
at
every
step
the
losses
of
the
federals
increased
and
the
shattered
divisions
passing
through
two
regiments
of
regulars
which
had
been
sent
forward
to
support
them
sought
shelter
in
the
woods
then
porter
and
hatch
under
cover
of
their
artillery
withdrew
their
infantry
ricketts
had
fallen
back
before
his
troops
arrived
within
decisive
range
under
the
impression
that
he
was
about
to
pursue
a
retreating
enemy
he
had
found
on
advancing
instead
of
a
thin
screen
of
skirmishers
a
line
of
battle
strongly
established
and
backed
by
batteries
to
which
he
was
unable
to
reply
against
such
odds
attack
would
only
have
increased
the
slaughter
map
of
the
positions
on
august
it
was
after
four
three
hours
of
daylight
yet
remained
time
enough
still
to
secure
a
victory
but
the
federal
army
was
in
no
condition
to
renew
the
attack
worn
with
long
marches
deprived
of
their
supplies
and
oppressed
by
the
consciousness
that
they
were
both
officers
and
men
had
lost
all
confidence
every
single
division
on
the
field
had
been
engaged
and
every
single
division
had
been
beaten
back
for
four
days
according
to
general
pope
they
had
been
following
a
flying
foe
we
were
sent
forward
reported
a
regimental
commander
with
quiet
sarcasm
to
pursue
the
enemy
who
was
said
to
be
retreating
we
found
the
enemy
but
did
not
see
them
retreat
nor
had
there
been
a
larger
reserve
in
hand
would
a
further
advance
have
been
permitted
the
stonewall
division
although
regiments
were
breaking
up
before
its
onset
had
been
ordered
to
fall
back
before
it
became
exposed
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
federal
guns
but
the
woods
to
the
south
where
longstreet
divisions
had
been
lying
for
so
many
hours
were
already
alive
with
bayonets
the
grey
skirmishers
extending
far
beyond
pope
left
were
moving
rapidly
down
the
slopes
of
stuart
hill
and
the
fire
of
the
artillery
massed
on
the
ridge
in
rear
was
increasing
every
moment
in
intensity
the
federals
just
now
advancing
in
pursuit
were
suddenly
thrown
on
the
defensive
and
the
hand
of
a
great
captain
snatched
control
of
the
battle
from
the
grasp
of
pope
as
porter
reeled
back
from
jackson
front
lee
had
seen
his
opportunity
the
whole
army
was
ordered
to
advance
to
the
attack
longstreet
prepared
since
dawn
for
the
counterstroke
had
moved
before
the
message
reached
him
and
the
exulting
yells
of
his
soldiers
were
now
resounding
through
the
forest
jackson
was
desired
to
cover
longstreet
left
and
sending
starke
and
lawton
across
the
meadows
strewn
with
the
bloody
debris
of
porter
onslaught
he
instructed
hill
to
advance
en
echelon
with
his
left
refused
anticipating
the
order
the
commander
of
the
light
division
was
already
sweeping
through
the
groveton
wood
the
federal
gunners
striving
valiantly
to
cover
the
retreat
of
their
shattered
infantry
met
the
advance
of
the
southerners
with
a
rapid
fire
pope
and
mcdowell
exerted
themselves
to
throw
a
strong
force
on
to
the
heights
above
bull
run
and
the
two
brigades
upon
the
left
warren
and
alexander
already
overlapped
made
a
gallant
effort
to
gain
time
for
the
occupation
of
the
new
position
but
the
counterstroke
of
lee
was
not
to
be
withstood
by
a
few
regiments
of
infantry
the
field
of
bull
run
had
seen
many
examples
of
the
attack
as
executed
by
indifferent
tacticians
at
the
first
battle
isolated
brigades
had
advanced
at
wide
intervals
of
time
at
the
second
battle
the
federals
had
assaulted
by
successive
divisions
out
of
infantry
no
more
than
had
been
simultaneously
engaged
and
when
a
partial
success
had
been
achieved
there
were
no
supports
at
hand
to
complete
the
victory
when
the
confederates
came
forward
it
was
in
other
fashion
and
those
who
had
the
wit
to
understand
were
now
to
learn
the
difference
between
mediocrity
and
genius
between
the
of
the
one
and
the
resolution
of
the
other
lee
order
for
the
advance
embraced
his
whole
army
every
regiment
every
battery
and
every
squadron
was
employed
no
reserves
save
the
artillery
were
retained
upon
the
ridge
but
wave
after
wave
of
bayonets
followed
closely
on
the
to
drive
the
attack
forward
by
a
quick
succession
of
reinforcements
to
push
it
home
by
weight
of
numbers
to
pile
blow
on
blow
to
keep
the
defender
occupied
along
his
whole
front
and
to
provide
for
retreat
should
retreat
be
necessary
not
by
throwing
in
fresh
troops
but
by
leaving
the
enemy
so
crippled
that
he
would
be
powerless
to
pursue
such
were
the
tactics
of
the
confederate
leader
the
field
was
still
covered
with
porter
and
hatch
disordered
masses
when
lee
strong
array
advanced
and
the
sight
was
magnificent
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
long
grey
lines
of
infantry
with
the
crimson
of
the
colours
gleaming
like
blood
in
the
evening
sun
swept
with
ordered
ranks
across
the
groveton
valley
batteries
galloped
furiously
to
the
front
far
away
to
the
right
fluttered
the
guidons
of
stuart
squadrons
and
over
all
the
massed
artillery
maintained
a
tremendous
fire
the
men
drew
fresh
vigour
from
this
powerful
combination
the
enthusiasm
of
the
troops
was
as
intense
as
their
excitement
with
great
difficulty
it
is
related
were
the
gunners
restrained
from
joining
in
the
charge
and
the
officers
of
the
staff
could
scarcely
resist
the
impulse
to
throw
themselves
with
their
victorious
comrades
upon
the
retreating
foe
the
advance
was
made
in
the
following
order
wilcox
division
north
of
the
turnpike
connected
with
right
then
came
evans
facing
the
two
brigades
which
formed
the
federal
left
and
extending
across
the
turnpike
behind
evans
came
anderson
on
the
left
and
kemper
on
the
right
then
in
prolongation
of
kemper
line
but
at
some
interval
marched
the
division
of
jones
flanked
by
stuart
cavalry
and
on
the
further
wing
extending
towards
bull
run
were
starke
lawton
and
hill
men
including
the
cavalry
were
thus
deployed
over
a
front
of
four
miles
each
division
was
formed
in
at
least
two
lines
and
in
the
centre
where
anderson
and
kemper
supported
evans
were
no
less
than
eight
brigades
one
in
rear
of
the
other
the
federal
advanced
line
behind
which
the
troops
which
had
been
engaged
in
the
last
attack
were
slowly
rallying
extended
from
the
groveton
wood
to
a
low
hill
south
of
the

formed
in

then
jackson
reforming
his

along

swinging
round
to

moved
swiftly
against

here
in
addition
to
the
infantry
were
posted
three
union
batteries
and
the
artillery
made
a
desperate
endeavour
to
stay
the
counterstroke
but
nothing
could
withstand
the
vehement
charge
of
the

they
came
on
says
the

of

like

reformed

the

of

a
fierce
conflict
was
meanwhile
raging
from

several

which
in

of

not

anderson

were
then
brought
up
the

of
the
defenders
was
turned
a
counterstroke
was
beaten
back
ridge
after
ridge
was
mastered
the
edge
of
every
wood
was
stormed
and
as
the
sun
set
behind
the
mountains
bald
hill
was
carried
during
this
fierce
action
the
division
of
jones
leaving
the
chinn
house
to
the
left
had
advanced
against
the
henry
hill
on
the
very
ground
which
jackson
had
held
in
his
first
battle
the
best
troops
of
the
federal
army
were
rapidly
assembling
here
were
sykes
regulars
and
reynolds
pennsylvanians
where
the
woods
permitted
batteries
had
been
established
and
porter
fifth
army
corps
who
at
gaines
mill
and
malvern
hill
had
proved
such
stubborn
fighters
opposed
a
strong
front
once
more
to
their
persistent
foes
despite
the
rapid
fire
of
the
artillery
the
southerners
swept
forward
with
unabated
vigour
but
as
the
attack
was
pressed
the
resistance
of
the
federals
grew
more
stubborn
and
before
long
the
confederate
formation
lost
its
strength
the
lines
in
rear
had
been
called
up
the
assistance
of
the
strong
centre
had
been
required
to
rout
the
defenders
of
bald
hill
and
although
anderson
and
wilcox
pressed
forward
on
his
left
jones
had
not
sufficient
strength
to
storm
the
enemy
last
position
moreover
the
confederate
artillery
had
been
unable
to
follow
the
infantry
over
the
broken
ground
the
cavalry
confronted
by
buford
squadrons
and
embarrassed
by
the
woods
could
lend
no
active
aid
and
the
federals
defeated
as
they
were
had
not
yet
lost
all
heart
whatever
their
guns
could
do
in
so
close
a
country
to
relieve
the
infantry
had
been
accomplished
and
the
infantry
though
continually
outflanked
held
together
with
unflinching
courage
stragglers
there
were
and
stragglers
in
such
large
numbers
that
bayard
cavalry
brigade
had
been
ordered
to
the
rear
to
drive
them
back
but
the
majority
of
the
men
hardened
by
months
of
discipline
and
constant
battle
remained
staunch
to
the
colours
the
conviction
that
the
battle
was
lost
was
no
longer
a
signal
for
the
thinking
bayonets
to
make
certain
of
their
individual
safety
and
the
regulars
for
the
second
time
on
the
same
field
provided
a
strong
nucleus
of
resistance
thrown
into
the
woods
along
the
road
five
battalions
of
the
united
states
army
held
the
extreme
left
the
most
critical
point
of
the
federal
line
until
the
second
brigade
relieved
them
to
their
right
meade
and
his
pennsylvanians
held
fast
against
anderson
and
wilcox
and
although
six
guns
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
confederate
infantry
and
four
of
longstreet
batteries
which
had
accompanied
the

his

were

intermingled
in

had
advanced
at

superior
in
numbers

came

from

the

however
put

even
the

were
constrained
to

it

impossible
in

during

which
was
accompanied
by

rain
the

quietly
withdrew
leaving

of

on

found

in

on

with
an
audacity

was
powerless
to

reported
to

that
on
the
whole
the
results
of
the

were
favourable
to

the

he
wrote
largely
reinforced
assailed
our
position
early
we
held
our
ground
firmly
until
when
the
enemy
massing
very
heavy
forces
on
our
left
forced
that
wing
back
about
half
a
mile
at
dark
we
held
that
position
under
all
the
circumstances
with
horses
and
men
having
been
two
days
without
food
and
the
enemy
greatly
outnumbering
us
i
thought
it
best
to
move
back
to
this
place
at
dark
the
movement
has
been
made
in
perfect
order
and
without
loss
the
battle
was
most
furious
for
hours
without
cessation
and
the
losses
on
both
sides
very
heavy
the
enemy
is
badly
whipped
and
we
shall
do
well
enough
do
not
be
uneasy
we
will
hold
our
own
here
pope
actions
however
were
invariably
at
variance
with
words
at
he
had
ordered
franklin
who
was
approaching
bull
run
from
alexandria
with
fresh
troops
to
occupy
with
his
own
command
and
whatever
other
troops
he
could
collect
the
fortifications
round
centreville
and
hold
them
to
the
last
extremity
banks
still
at
bristoe
station
was
told
to
destroy
all
the
supplies
of
which
he
was
in

as
well
as

to
march
on
centreville

and
more
than
wounded
were
left
upon

nor
were

anticipations
as
to
the

to

was

the

there
was
ammunition
in
abundance
and

for
the
latter
also
had
come
up
from

more
than
compensated
for
the
casualties
of
the

but
formidable
earthworks
against
generals
who
dare

are
often
a
mere
trap

and

were
in

up

of

on

while
jackson
crossing
not
by
the
stone
bridge
but
by
sudley
ford
was
entrusted
with
the
work
of
forcing
pope
from
his
strong
position
the
weather
was
inclement
the
roads
were
quagmires
and
the
men
were
in
no
condition
to
make
forced
marches
yet
before
nightfall
jackson
had
pushed
ten
miles
through
the
mud
halting
near
pleasant
valley
on
the
little
river
turnpike
five
miles
of

during
the
afternoon

throwing
a

across

run
to
keep
the
enemy
on
the
qui
vive
followed
the
same
route
of
these
movements
pope
received
no
warning
and
jackson
proclivity
for
flank
manoeuvres
had
evidently
made
no
impression
on
him
for
in
blissful
unconsciousness
that
his
line
of
retreat
was
already
threatened
he
ordered
all
waggons
to
be
unloaded
at
centreville
and
to
return
to
fairfax
station
for
forage
and
rations
september
but
on
the
morning
of
september
although
his
whole
army
including
banks
was
closely
concentrated
behind
strong
intrenchments
pope
had
conceived
a
suspicion
that
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
fulfil
his
promise
to
halleck
that
he
would
hold
on
the
previous
night
stuart
had
been
active
towards
his
right
and
rear
capturing
his
reconnoitring
parties
and
shelling
his
trains
before
noon
suspicion
became
certainty
either
stragglers
or
the
country
people
reported
that
jackson
was
moving
down
the
little
river
turnpike
and
centreville
was
at
once
evacuated
the
troops
marching
to
a
new
position
round
fairfax
court
house
jackson
meanwhile
covered
by
the
cavalry
was
advancing
to
chantilly
a
fine
old
mansion
which
the
federals
had
gutted
with
the
intention
of
seizing
a
position
whence
he
could
command
the
road
the
day
was
sombre
and
a
tempest
was
gathering
in
the
mountains
late
in
the
afternoon
stuart
patrols
near
ox
hill
were
driven
in
by
hostile
infantry
the
thick
woods
preventing
the
scouts
from
ascertaining
the
strength
or
dispositions
of
the
federal
force
jackson
at
once
ordered
two
brigades
of
hill
to
feel
the
enemy
the
remainder
of
the
light
division
took
ground
to
the
right
followed
by
lawton
starke
division
held
the
turnpike
and
stuart
was
sent
towards
fairfax
court
house
to
ascertain
whether
the
federal
main
body
was
retreating
or
advancing
reno
who
had
been
ordered
to
protect
pope
flank
came
briskly
forward
and
hill
advanced
guard
was
soon
brought
to
a
standstill
three
fresh
brigades
were
rapidly
deployed
as
the
enemy
pressed
the
attack
a
fourth
was
sent
in
and
the
northerners
fell
back
with
the
loss
of
a
general
and
many
men
lawton
first
line
became
engaged
at
the

time

now
reinforced
by

vigorous
effort

trimble
brigade
now
reduced
to
a
handful
became
involved
in
the
confusion
but
a
vigorous
charge
of
the
second
line
restored
the
battle
the
federals
were
beginning
to
give
way
general
kearney
riding
through
the
murky
twilight
into
the
confederate
lines
was
shot
by
a
skirmisher
the
hostile
lines
were
within
short
range
and
the
advent
of
a
reserve
on
either
side
would
have
probably
ended
the
engagement
but
the
rain
was
now
falling
in
torrents
heavy
peals
of
thunder
crashing
through
the
forest
drowned
the
discharges
of
the
two
guns
which
jackson
had
brought
up
through
the
woods
and
the
red
flash
of
musketry
paled
before
the
vivid
lightning
much
of
the
ammunition
was
rendered
useless
the
men
were
unable
to
discharge
their
pieces
and
the
fierce
wind
lashed
the
rain
in
the
faces
of
the
confederates
the
night
grew
darker
and
the
tempest
fiercer
and
as
if
by
mutual
consent
the
opposing
lines
drew
gradually
apart
it
was
at
this
time
probably
that
jackson
received
a
message
from
a
brigade
commander
reporting
that
his
cartridges
were
so
wet
that
he
feared
he
could
not
maintain
his
position
tell
him
was
the
quick
reply
to
hold
his
ground
if
his
guns
will
not
go
off
neither
will
the
enemy
on
the
side
of
the
confederates
only
half
the
force
had
been
engaged
starke
division
never
came
into
action
and
of
hill
and
there
were
still
brigades
in
reserve
men
were
killed
or
wounded
but
although
the
three
federal
divisions
are
reported
to
have
lost
they
had
held
their
ground
and
jackson
was
thwarted
in
his
design
pope
trains
and
his
whole
army
reached
fairfax
court
house
without
further
disaster
but
the
persistent
attacks
of
his
indefatigable
foe
had
broken
down
his
resolution
he
had
intended
he
told
halleck
when
jackson
march
down
the
little
river
turnpike
was
first
announced
to
attack
the
confederates
the
next
day
or
certainly
the
day
after
september
the
action
at
chantilly
however
induced
a
more
prudent
mood
and
on
the
morning
of
the
he
reported
that
there
was
an
intense
idea
among
the
troops
that
they
must
get
behind
the
intrenchments
of
alexandria
that
there
was
an
undoubted
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
keep
on
slowly
turning
his
position
so
as
to
come
in
on
the
right
and
that
the
forces
under
his
command
were
unable
to
prevent
him
doing
so
in
the
open
field
halleck
must
decide
what
was
to
be
done
the
reply
was
prompt
pope
was
to
bring
his
forces
as
best
he
could
under
the
shelter
of
the
heavy
guns
whatever
might
be
the
truth
as
regards
the
troops
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
the
general
was
demoralised
and
preceded
by
thousands
of
stragglers
the
army
fell
back
without
further
delay
to
the
potomac
it
was
not
followed
except
by
stuart
it
was
found
says
lee
in
his
official
dispatch
that
the
enemy
had
conducted
his
retreat
so
rapidly
that
the
attempt
to
interfere
with
him
was
abandoned
the
proximity
of
the
fortifications
around
alexandria
and
washington
rendered
further
pursuit
useless
on
the
same
day
general
mcclellan
was
entrusted
with
the
defence
of
washington
and
pope
permitted
to
resign
was
soon
afterwards
relegated
to
an
obscure
command
against
the
indians
of
the
his
errors
had
been
flagrant
he
can
hardly
be
charged
with
want
of
energy
but
his
energy
was
spasmodic
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
strangely
indolent
and
yet
he
distrusted
the
reports
of
others
but
more
fatal
than
his
neglect
of
personal
reconnaissance
was
his
power
of
he
was
absolutely
incapable
of
putting
himself
in
his
enemy
place
and
time
after
time
he
acted
on
the
supposition
that
lee
and
jackson
would
do
exactly
what
he
most
wished
them
to
do
when
his
supplies
were
destroyed
he
concentrated
at
manassas
junction
convinced
that
jackson
would
remain
to
be
overwhelmed
when
he
found
jackson
near
sudley
springs
and
thoroughfare
gap
open
he
rushed
forward
to
attack
him
convinced
that
longstreet
could
not
be
up
for
hours
when
he
sought
shelter
at
centreville
he
told
halleck
not
to
be
uneasy
convinced
that
lee
would
knock
his
head
against
his
fortified
position
before
the
engagement
at
chantilly
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
the
enemy
the
next
morning
a
few
hours
later
he
reported
that
his
troops
were
utterly
untrustworthy
although
of
them
under
franklin
and
sumner
had
not
yet
seen
the
enemy
in
other
respects
his
want
of
prudence
had
thwarted
his
best
endeavours
his
cavalry
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
was
effectively
employed
but
so
extravagant
were
his
demands
on
the
mounted
arm
that
before
the
battle
of
manassas
half
his
regiments
were
dismounted
it
is
true
that
the
troopers
were
still
indifferent
horsemen
and
bad
but
it
was
the
fault
of
the
commander
that
the
unfortunate
animals
had
no
rest
that
brigades
were
sent
to
do
the
work
of
patrols
and
that
little
heed
was
paid
to
the
physical
wants
of
man
and
beast
as
a
tactician
pope
was
incapable
as
a
strategist
he
lacked
imagination
except
in
his
dispatches
his
horizon
was
limited
and
he
measured
the
capacity
of
his
adversaries
by
his
own
he
was
familiar
with
the
campaign
in
the
valley
with
the
operations
in
the
peninsula
and
cedar
run
should
have
enlightened
him
as
to
jackson
daring
but
he
had
no
conception
that
his
adversaries
would
cheerfully
accept
great
risks
to
achieve
great
ends
he
had
never
dreamt
of
a
general
who
would
deliberately
divide
his
army
or
of
one
who
would
make
miles
in
two
marches
lee
with
his
extraordinary
insight
into
character
had
played
on
pope
as
he
had
played
on
mcclellan
and
his
strategy
was
justified
by
success
in
the
space
of
three
weeks
he
had
carried
the
war
from
the
james
to
the
potomac
with
an
army
that
at
no
time
exceeded
men
he
had
driven
into
the
fortifications
of
washington
sumner
and
franklin
had
become
involved
in
pope
retreat
he
had
captured
guns
prisoners
rifles
and
many
stand
of
colours
he
had
killed
or
wounded
federals
destroyed
supplies
and
material
of
enormous
value
and
all
this
with
a
loss
to
the
confederates
of
officers
and
men
so
much
had
he
done
for
the
south
for
his
own
reputation
he
had
done
more
if
as
moltke
avers
the
junction
of
two
armies
on
the
field
of
battle
is
the
highest
achievement
of
military
genius
tried
by
this
test
alone
lee
stands
out
as
one
of
the
greatest
soldiers
of
all
times
not
only
against
pope
but
against
mcclellan
at
gaines
mill
against
burnside
at
fredericksburg
and
against
hooker
at
chancellorsville
he
succeeded
in
carrying
out
the
operations
of
which
moltke
speaks
and
in
each
case
with
the
same
result
of
surprising
his
adversary
none
knew
better
how
to
apply
that
great
principle
of
strategy
to
march
divided
but
to
fight
concentrated
the
campaign
against
pope
has
seldom
been
surpassed
and
the
great
counterstroke
at
manassas
is
sufficient
in
itself
to
make
reputation
as
a
tactician
salamanca
was
perhaps
a
more
brilliant
example
of
the
same
manoeuvre
for
at
salamanca
wellington
had
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
marmont
would
blunder
and
the
mighty
stroke
which
beat
french
in
forty
minutes
was
conceived
in
a
few
moments
nor
does
manassas
equal
austerlitz
no
such
subtle
manoeuvres
were
employed
as
those
by
which
napoleon
induced
the
allies
to
lay
bare
their
centre
and
drew
them
blindly
to
their
doom
it
was
not
due
to
the
skill
of
lee
that
pope
weakened
his
left
at
the
crisis
of
the
battle
it
may
be
noticed
however
that
the
care
with
which
longstreet
troops
were
kept
concealed
for
more
than
hours
had
much
to
do
with
pope
false
manoeuvres
but
in
the
rapidity
with
which
the
opportunity
was
seized
in
the
combination
of
the
three
arms
and
in
the
vigour
of
the
blow
manassas
is
in
no
way
inferior
to
austerlitz
or
salamanca
that
the
result
was
less
decisive
was
due
to
the
greater
difficulties
of
the
to
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
enemy
to
the
obstacles
in
the
way
of
rapid
and
connected
movement
and
to
the
inexperience
of
the
troops
manassas
was
not
like
austerlitz
and
salamanca
won
by
veteran
soldiers
commanded
by
trained
officers
perfect
in
drill
and
inured
to
discipline
lee
strategic
manoeuvres
were
undoubtedly
hazardous
but
that
an
antagonist
of
different
calibre
would
have
met
them
with
condign
punishment
is
criticism
against
an
antagonist
of
different
calibre
against
such
generals
as
he
was
afterwards
to
encounter
they
would
never
have
been
attempted
he
studied
his
adversary
says
his
military
secretary
knew
his
peculiarities
and
adapted
himself
to
them
his
own
methods
no
one
could
varied
them
with
every
change
in
the
commanders
opposed
to
him
he
had
one
method
with
mcclellan
another
with
pope
another
with
hooker
another
with
meade
and
yet
another
with
grant
nor
was
the
dangerous
period
of
the
manassas
campaign
so
protracted
as
might
be
thought
jackson
marched
north
from
jefferson
on
august
on
the
he
reached
bristoe
station
pope
during
these
two
days
might
have
thrown
himself
either
on
longstreet
or
on
jackson
he
did
neither
and
on
the
morning
of
the
when
jackson
reached
sudley
springs
the
crisis
had
passed
had
the
federals
blocked
thoroughfare
gap
that
day
and
prevented
longstreet
passage
lee
was
still
able
to
concentrate
without
incurring
defeat
jackson
retreating
by
aldie
gap
would
have
joined
longstreet
west
of
the
mountains
pope
would
have
escaped
defeat
but
the
confederates
would
have
lost
nothing
moreover
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
confederate
cavalry
was
in
every
single
respect
in
leading
horsemanship
training
and
knowledge
of
the
country
superior
to
the
federal
the
whole
population
too
was
staunchly
southern
it
was
always
probable
therefore
that
information
would
be
scarce
in
the
federal
camps
and
that
if
some
items
did
get
through
the
cavalry
screen
they
would
be
so
late
in
reaching
pope
headquarters
as
to
be
practically
useless
there
can
be
no
question
that
lee
in
these
operations
relied
much
on
the
skill
of
stuart
stuart
was
given
a
free
hand
unlike
pope
lee
issued
few
orders
as
to
the
disposition
of
his
horsemen
he
merely
explained
the
manoeuvres
he
was
about
to
undertake
pointed
out
where
he
wished
the
main
body
of
the
cavalry
should
be
found
and
left
all
else
to
their
commander
he
had
no
need
to
tell
stuart
that
he
required
information
of
the
enemy
or
to
lay
down
the
method
by
which
it
was
to
be
obtained
that
was
stuart
normal
duty
and
right
well
was
it
performed
how
admirably
the
young
cavalry
general
with
jackson
has
already
been
described
the
latter
suggested
the
former
executed
and
the
combination
of
the
three
arms
during
the
whole
of
jackson
operations
against
pope
was
as
close
as
when
ashby
led
his
squadrons
in
the
valley
yet
it
was
not
on
stuart
that
fell
next
to
lee
the
honours
of
the
campaign
brilliant
as
was
the
handling
of
the
cavalry
impenetrable
the
screen
it
formed
and
ample
the
information
it
procured
the
breakdown
of
the
federal
horse
made
the
task
comparatively
simple
against
adversaries
whose
chargers
were
so
that
they
could
hardly
raise
a
trot
it
was
easy
to
be
bold
one
of
brigadiers
would
have
probably
done
the
work
as
well
as
stuart
himself
but
the
handling
of
the
valley
army
from
the
time
it
left
jefferson
on
the
until
longstreet
reached
gainesville
on
the
demanded
higher
qualities
than
vigilance
and
activity
throughout
the
operations
jackson
endurance
was
the
wonder
of
his
staff
he
hardly
slept
he
was
untiring
in
reconnaissance
in
examination
of
the
country
and
in
observation
of
the
enemy
and
no
detail
of
the
march
escaped
his
personal
scrutiny
fet
his
muscles
were
much
less
hardly
used
than
his
brain
the
intellectual
problem
was
more
difficult
than
the
physical
to
march
his
army
miles
in
two
days
was
far
simpler
than
to
maintain
it
on
pope
flank
until
longstreet
came
into
line
the
direction
of
his
marches
the
position
of
his
bivouacs
the
distribution
of
his
three
divisions
were
the
outcome
of
long
premeditation
on
the
night
of
the
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
on
the
road
to
salem
leaving
the
federals
under
the
conviction
that
he
was
making
for
the
valley
on
the
he
moved
on
bristoe
station
rather
than
on
manassas
junction
foreseeing
that
he
might
be
interrupted
from
the
in
his
destruction
of
the
stores
on
the
he
postponed
his
departure
till
night
had
fallen
moving
in
three
columns
of
which
the
column
marching
on
centreville
whither
he
desired
that
the
enemy
should
follow
was
the
last
to
move
concentrating
at
sudley
springs
on
the
he
placed
himself
in
the
best
position
to
hold
pope
fast
to
combine
with
longstreet
or
to
escape
by
aldie
gap
and
on
the
the
ground
he
had
selected
for
battle
enabled
him
to
hold
out
against
superior
numbers
neither
strategically
nor
tactically
did
he
make
a
single
mistake
his
attack
on
king
division
at
groveton
on
the
evening
of
the
was
purely
frontal
and
his
troops
lost
heavily
but
he
believed
king
to
be
the
of
a
larger
force
and
under
such
circumstances
turning
movements
were
the
woods
too
prevented
the
deployment
of
his
artillery
and
the
attack
in
its
wider
aspect
was
eminently
successful
for
the
aim
was
not
to
defeat
king
but
to
bring
pope
back
to
a
position
where
lee
could
crush
him
on
the
his
dispositions
were
admirable
the
battle
is
a
fine
example
of
defensive
tactics
the
position
to
use
a
familiar
illustration
fitted
the
troops
like
a
glove
it
was
of
such
strength
that
while
the
front
was
adequately
manned
ample
reserves
remained
in
rear
the
left
the
most
dangerous
flank
was
secured
by
bull
run
and
massed
batteries
gave
protection
to
the
right
the
distribution
of
the
troops
the
orders
and
the
amount
of
latitude
accorded
to
subordinate
leaders
followed
the
best
models
the
front
was
so
apportioned
that
each
brigadier
on
the
had
his
own
reserve
and
each
divisional
general
half
his
force
in
third
line
the
orders
indicated
that
counterstrokes
were
not
to
be
pushed
so
far
as
to
involve
the
troops
in
an
engagement
with
the
reserves
and
the
subordinate
generals
were
encouraged
without
waiting
for
orders
and
thus
losing
the
occasion
to
seize
all
favourable
opportunities
for
counterstroke
the
methods
employed
by
jackson
were
singularly
like
those
of
wellington
a
position
was
selected
which
gave
cover
and
concealment
to
the
troops
and
against
which
the
powerful
artillery
of
a
more
numerous
enemy
was
practically
useless
these
were
the
characteristics
of
vimiera
busaco
talavera
and
waterloo
nor
did
jackson
orders
differ
from
those
of
the
great
englishman
the
duke
subordinates
when
placed
in
position
acted
on
a
rule
within
that
position
they
had
unlimited
power
they
could
defend
the
first
line
or
they
could
meet
the
enemy
with
a
from
a
position
in
rear
and
in
both
cases
they
could
pursue
but
the
pursuit
was
never
to
be
carried
beyond
certain
defined
limits
moreover
wellington
views
as
to
the
efficacy
of
the
counterstroke
were
identical
with
those
of
jackson
and
he
had
the
same
predilection
for
cold
steel
if
they
attempt
this
point
again
hill
were
his
orders
to
that
general
at
busaco
give
them
a
volley
and
charge
bayonets
but
do
let
your
people
follow
them
too
far
but
it
was
neither
wise
strategy
nor
sound
tactics
which
was
the
main
element
in
pope
defeat
neither
the
strong
effort
of
a
powerful
brain
nor
the
judicious
devolution
of
responsibility
a
brilliant
military
historian
more
conversant
perhaps
with
the
war
of
secession
than
the
wars
of
france
concludes
his
review
of
this
campaign
with
a
reference
to
jackson
as
the
ney
of
the
confederate
army
swinton
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
the
allusion
is
obvious
so
long
as
the
victories
of
napoleon
are
remembered
the
name
of
his
lieutenant
will
always
be
a
synonym
for
heroic
valour
but
the
valour
of
ney
was
of
a
different
type
from
that
of
jackson
ney
valour
was
animal
jackson
was
moral
and
between
the
two
there
is
a
vast
distinction
before
the
enemy
when
his
danger
was
tangible
ney
had
few
rivals
but
when
the
enemy
was
unseen
and
his
designs
were
doubtful
his
resolution
vanished
he
was
without
confidence
in
his
own
resources
he
could
not
act
without
direct
orders
and
he
dreaded
responsibility
at
bautzen
his
timidity
ruined
napoleon
combinations
in
the
campaign
of
leipsic
he
showed
himself
incapable
of
independent
command
and
he
can
not
be
acquitted
of
hesitation
at
quatre
bras
it
was
in
the
same
circumstances
that
ney
courage
invariably
gave
way
that
jackson
courage
shone
with
the
brightest
lustre
it
might
appear
that
he
had
little
cause
for
fear
in
the
campaign
of
the
second
manassas
that
he
had
only
to
follow
his
instructions
and
that
if
he
had
failed
his
failure
would
have
been
visited
upon
lee
the
instructions
which
he
received
however
were
not
positive
but
contingent
on
events
if
possible
he
was
to
cut
the
railway
in
order
to
delay
the
reinforcements
which
pope
was
expecting
from
alexandria
and
then
should
the
enemy
permit
he
was
to
hold
fast
east
of
the
bull
run
mountains
until
lee
came
up
but
he
was
to
be
guided
in
everything
by
his
own
discretion
he
was
free
to
accept
battle
or
refuse
it
to
attack
or
to
defend
to
select
his
own
line
of
retreat
to
move
to
any
quarter
of
the
compass
that
he
pleased
for
three
days
from
the
morning
of
august
to
the
morning
of
august
he
had
complete
control
of
the
strategic
situation
on
his
movements
were
dependent
the
movements
of
the
main
army
the
bringing
the
enemy
to
bay
and
the
choice
of
the
field
of
battle
were
both
in
his
hands
and
during
those
three
days
he
was
cut
off
from
lee
and
longstreet
the
mountains
with
their
narrow
passes
lay
between
and
surrounded
by
three
times
his
number
he
was
abandoned
entirely
to
his
own
resources
throughout
the
operations
he
had
been
in
unusually
high
spirits
the
peril
and
responsibility
seemed
to
act
as
an
elixir
and
he
threw
off
much
of
his
constraint
but
as
the
day
broke
on
august
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
in
the
direction
of
thoroughfare
gap
and
when
a
messenger
from
stuart
brought
the
intelligence
that
longstreet
was
through
the
pass
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
letter
from
hunter
mcguire
the
period
of
suspense
was
over
but
even
on
that
unyielding
heart
the
weight
of
anxiety
had
pressed
with
fearful
force
for
three
days
he
had
only
received
news
of
the
main
army
at
long
and
uncertain
intervals
for
two
of
these
days
his
information
of
the
enemy
movements
was
very
small
while
he
was
marching
to
bristoe
station
pope
for
all
he
knew
might
have
been
marching
against
longstreet
with
his
whole
force
when
he
attacked
king
on
the
the
federals
in
what
strength
he
knew
not
still
held
thoroughfare
gap
when
he
formed
for
action
on
the
he
was
still
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
to
the
main
body
and
it
was
on
the
bare
chance
that
longstreet
would
force
the
passage
that
he
accepted
battle
with
far
superior
numbers
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
how
a
general
like
ney
placed
in
jackson
situation
would
have
trimmed
and
hesitated
how
in
his
march
to
manassas
when
he
had
crossed
the
mountains
and
left
the
gap
behind
him
he
would
have
sent
out
reconnaissances
in
all
directions
halting
his
troops
until
he
learned
the
coast
was
clear
how
he
would
have
dashed
at
the
junction
by
the
shortest
route
how
he
would
have
forced
his
weary
troops
northward
when
the
enemy
approach
was
reported
how
had
he
reached
sudley
springs
he
would
have
hugged
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
let
king
division
pass
unmolested
and
finally
when
pope
columns
converged
on
his
position
have
fallen
back
on
thoroughfare
or
aldie
nor
would
he
have
been
greatly
to
blame
unless
gifted
with
that
moral
fortitude
which
napoleon
ranks
higher

the
indomitable
courage
characteristic
of

greatest
soldiers
as
suggested
in
the
first
volume
it
is
too
often
overlooked
by
those
who
study
the
history
of
campaign
that
war
is
the
province
of
uncertainty
the
reader
has
the
whole
theatre
of
war
displayed
before
him
he
notes
the
exact
disposition
of
the
opposing
forces
at
each
hour
of
the
campaign
and
with
this
in
his
mind
eye
he
condemns
or
approves
the
action
of
the
commanders
in
the
action
of
the
defeated
general
he
usually
often
sees
much
to
blame
in
the
action
of
the
successful
general
but
little
to
admire
but
his
judgment
is
not
based
on
a
true
foundation
he
has
ignored
the
fact
that
the
information
at
his
disposal
was
not
at
the
disposal
of
those
he
criticises
and
until
he
realises
that
both
generals
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
must
have
been
groping
in
the
dark
he
will
neither
make
just
allowance
for
the
errors
of
the
one
nor
appreciate
the
genius
of
the
other
it
is
true
that
it
is
difficult
in
the
extreme
to
ascertain
how
much
or
how
little
those
generals
whose
campaigns
have
become
historical
knew
of
their
enemy
at
any
particular
moment
for
instance
in
the
campaign
before
us
we
are
nowhere
told
whether
lee
when
he
sent
jackson
to
manassas
junction
was
aware
that
a
portion
of
army
had
been
shipped
to
alexandria
in
place
of
aquia
or
whether
he
knew
on
the
second
day
of
the
battle
of
manassas
that
pope
had
been
reinforced
by
two
army
corps
from
the
peninsula
he
had
certainly
captured
pope
dispatch
book
and
no
doubt
it
threw
much
light
on
the
federal
plans
but
we
are
not
aware
how
far
into
the
future
this
light
projected
we
do
know
however
that
in
addition
to
this
correspondence
such
knowledge
as
he
had
was
derived
from
reports
but
reports
are
never
entirely
to
be
relied
on
they
are
seldom
full
they
are
often
false
and
they
are
generally
exaggerated
however
active
the
cavalry
however
patriotic
the
inhabitants
no
general
is
ever
possessed
of
accurate
information
of
his
enemy
dispositions
unless
the
forces
are
very
small
or
the
precautions
to
elude
observation
very
feeble

the
whole
country
round
jackson
army
and
during
the
whole
day
the
federal
columns
were
converging
on
manassas
sigel
and
reynolds
four
divisions
passed
through
gainesville
not
five
miles
from
sudley
springs
and
for
a
time
were
actually
in
contact
with
outposts
and
yet
sigel
and
reynolds
mistook
jackson
outposts
for
reconnoitring
cavalry
again
when
king
single
division
the
of
pope
army
appeared
upon
the
turnpike
jackson
attacked
it
with
the
idea
that
it
was
the
of
a
much
larger
force
nor
was
this
want
of
accurate
intelligence
due
to
lack
of
vigilance
or
to
the
dense
woods
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
confederates
were
more
amply
provided
with
information
than
is
usually
the
case
in
war
even
in
an
open
country
and
with
experienced
armies
but
if
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
a
general
is
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
which
has
been
most
aptly
named
the
fog
of
war
his
embarrassments
are
intensified
tenfold
when
he
commands
a
portion
of
a
divided
army
under
ordinary
conditions
a
general
is
at
least
fully
informed
of
the
dispositions
of
his
own
forces
but
when
between
two
widely
separated
columns
a
powerful
enemy
capable
of
crushing
each
in
turn
intervenes
when
the
movements
of
that
enemy
are
veiled
in
obscurity
when
anxiety
has
taken
possession
of
the
troops
and
the
soldiers
of
either
column
striving
hopelessly
to
penetrate
the
gloom
reflect
on
the
fate
that
may
have
overtaken
their
comrades
on
the
obstacles
that
may
delay
them
on
the
misunderstandings
that
may
have
occurred
it
is
at
such
a
crisis
that
the
courage
of
their
leader
is
put
to
the
severest
test
his
situation
has
been
compared
to
a
man
entering
a
dark
room
full
of
assailants
never
knowing
when
or
whence
a
blow
may
be
struck
against
him
the
illustration
is
inadequate
not
only
has
he
to
contend
with
the
promptings
of
his
own
instincts
but
he
has
to
contend
with
the
instincts
and
to
sustain
the
resolution
of
his
whole
army
it
is
not
from
the
enemy
he
has
most
to
fear
a
time
comes
in
all
protracted
operations
when
the
nervous
energy
of
the
best
troops
becomes
exhausted
when
the
most
daring
shrink
from
further
sacrifice
when
the
desire
of
infects
the
stoutest
veterans
and
the
will
of
the
mass
opposes
a
tacit
resistance
to
all
further
effort
then
says
clausewitz
the
spark
in
the
breast
of
the
commander
must
rekindle
hope
in
the
hearts
of
his
men
and
so
long
as
he
is
equal
to
this
he
remains
their
master
when
his
influence
ceases
and
his
own
spirit
is
no
longer
strong
enough
to
revive
the
spirit
of
others
the
masses
drawing
him
with
them
sink
into
that
lower
region
of
animal
nature
which
recoils
from
danger
and
knows
not
shame
such
are
the
obstacles
which
the
brain
and
courage
of
the
military
commander
must
overcome
if
he
is
to
make
his
name
illustrious
and
the
obstacles
are
never
more
formidable
than
when
his
troops
see
no
sign
of
the
support
they
have
expected
then
if
he
still
moves
forward
although
his
peril
increase
at
every
step
to
the
point
of
junction
if
he
declines
the
temptation
although
overwhelming
numbers
threaten
him
of
a
safe
line
of
retreat
if
as
did
jackson
he
deliberately
confronts
and
challenges
the
hostile
masses
then
indeed
does
the
soldier
rise
to
the
highest
level
of
moral
energy
strongly
does
napoleon
inveigh
against
operations
which
entail
the
division
of
an
army
into
two
columns
unable
to
communicate
and
especially
does
he
reprobate
the
strategy
which
places
the
point
of
junction
under
the
very
beard
of
a
concentrated
enemy
both
of
these
maxims
lee
violated
the
last
because
he
knew
pope
the
first
because
he
knew
jackson
it
is
rare
indeed
that
such
strategy
succeeds
when
all
has
depended

a
swift
and
unhesitating

the

attempted

victories

again
did
he

to
unite
it
again

the
reason
is
not

to
seek
there
was
now
no
general
in
the
confederate
army
to
whom
he
dared
confide
the
charge
of
the
detached
wing

in
possessing

such
general
he
had
been
more
fortunate
than

the
confederate
operations
in
virginia
during
the
spring
and

of
had
been
successful
beyond
expectation
and
almost
beyond
precedent
within
six
months
two
great
armies
had
been
defeated
mcclellan
had
been
driven
from
the
peninsula
and
pope
from
the
rappahannock
the
villages
of
virginia
no
longer
swarmed
with
foreign
bayonets
the
hostile
camps
had
vanished
from
her
inland
counties
richmond
was
free
from
menace
and
in
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
the
harvest
was
gathered
in
without
let
or
hindrance
except
at
winchester
and
martinsburg
where
the
garrisons
alarmed
by
the
news
of
pope
defeat
were
already
preparing
to
withdraw
in
the
vicinity
of
norfolk
and
at
fortress
monroe
the
invaders
had
no
foothold
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
they
had
just
now
overrun
and
their
demoralised
masses
lying
exhausted
behind
the
fortifications
of
washington
and
alexandria
were
in
no
condition
to
resume
the
offensive
the
north
had
opened
the
campaign
in
the
early
spring
with
the
confident
hope
of
capturing
the
rebel
capital
before
the
summer
was
over
it
was
questionable
whether
it
would
be
able
to
save
its
own
had
the
rival
armies
been
equally
matched
in
numbers
and
equipment
this
result
would
have
hardly
been
remarkable
the
federals
had
had
great
difficulties
to
contend
with
an
unknown
country
bad
roads
a
hostile
population
natural
obstacles
of
formidable
character
statesmen
ignorant
of
war
and
generals
at
loggerheads
with
the
administration
yet
so
superior
were
their
numbers
so
ample
their
resources
that
even
these
disadvantages
might
have
been
overcome
had
the
strategy
of
the
southern
leaders
been
less
admirable
lee
jackson
and
johnston
had
played
the
role
of
the
defender
to
perfection
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
hold
the
frontier
mobility
and
not
earthwork
was
the
weapon
on
which
they
had
relied
richmond
the
only
fortress
had
been
used
as
a
pivot
of
operations
and
not
merely
as
a
shelter
for
the
army
the
specious
expedient
of
pushing
forward
advanced
guards
to
harass
or
delay
the
enemy
had
been
avoided
and
thus
no
opportunity
had
been
offered
to
the
invaders
of
dealing
with
the
defence
in
detail
or
of
raising
their
own
morale
by
victory
over
isolated
detachments
the
generals
had
declined
battle
until
their
forces
were
concentrated
and
the
enemy
was
divided
nor
had
they
fought
except
on
ground
of
their
own
choice
johnston
had
refused
to
be
drawn
into
decisive
action
until
mcclellan
became
involved
in
the
swamps
of
the
chickahominy
jackson
imitating
like
his
superior
the
defensive
strategy
of
wellington
and
napoleon
had
fallen
back
to
a
zone
of
manoeuvre
south
of
the
massanuttons
by
retreating
to
the
inaccessible
fastness
of
elk
run
valley
he
had
drawn
banks
and
fremont
up
the
shenandoah
their
lines
of
communication
growing
longer
and
more
vulnerable
at
every
march
and
requiring
daily
more
men
to
guard
them
then
rushing
from
his
stronghold
he
had
dealt
his
blows
clearing
the
valley
from
end
to
end
destroying
the
federal
magazines
and
threatening
washington
itself
and
when
the
overwhelming
masses
he
had
drawn
on
himself
sought
to
cut
him
off
he
had
selected
his
own
and
crushed
the
converging
columns
which
his
skill
had
kept
apart
the
hapless
pope
too
had
been
handled
in
the
same
fashion
as
mcclellan
banks
shields
and
fremont
jackson
had
lured
him
forward
to
the
rapidan
and
although
his
retreat
had
been
speedy
lee
had
completed
his
defeat
before
he
could
be
efficiently
supported
but
notwithstanding
all
that
had
been
done
much
yet
remained
to
do
it
was
doubtless
within
the
bounds
of
probability
that
a
second
attempt
to
invade
virginia
would
succeed
no
better
than
the
first
but
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
the
resolution
of
the
north
was
not
sufficient
to
withstand
a
long
series
of
disasters
so
long
as
the
war
was
confined
to
southern
territory
and
at
the
same
time
it
might
well
be
questioned
whether
the
south
could
sustain
without
foreign
aid
the
protracted
and
exhausting
process
of
a
purely
defensive
warfare
if
her
tactics
as
well
as
her
strategy
could
be
confined
to
the
defensive
that
is
if
her
generals
could
await
the
invaders
in
selected
and
prepared
positions
and
if
no
task
more
difficult
should
devolve
upon
her
troops
than
shooting
down
their
foes
as
they
moved
across
the
open
to
the
assault
of
strong
intrenchments
then
the
hope
might
reasonably
be
entertained
that
she
might
tire
out
the
north
but
the
campaign
so
far
as
it
had
progressed
had
shown
if
indeed
history
had
not
already
made
it
sufficiently
clear
that
opportunities
for
such
tactics
were
not
likely
to
occur
the
federal
generals
had
consistently
refused
to
run
their
heads
against
earthworks
their
overwhelming
numbers
would
enable
them
to
turn
any
position
however
formidable
and
the
only
chance
of
success
lay
in
keeping
these
numbers
apart
and
in
preventing
them
from
combining
it
was
by
strategic
and
tactical
counterstrokes
that
the
recent
victories
had
been
won
although
it
had
awaited
attack
within
its
own
frontier
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
but
small
experience
of
defensive
warfare
with
the
exception
of
the
actions
round
yorktown
of
cross
keys
and
of
the
second
manassas
the
battles
had
been
entirely
aggressive
the
idea
that
a
small
army
opposed
to
one
vastly
superior
can
not
afford
to
attack
because
the
attack
is
costly
and
that
it
must
trust
for
success
to
favourable
ground
had
been
effectually
dispelled
lee
and
jackson
had
taught
the
southerners
that
the
secret
of
success
lies
not
in
strong
positions
but
in
the
concentration
by
means
of
skilful
strategy
of
superior
numbers
on
the
field
of
battle
their
tactics
had
been
essentially
offensive
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
their
victories
had
not
been
dearly
purchased
if
we
compare
them
with
those
of
the
british
in
the
peninsula
we
shall
find
that
with
no
greater
loss
than
wellington
incurred
in
the
defensive
engagements
of
three
years
the
confederates
had
attacked
and
routed
armies
far
larger
in
proportion
than
those
which
wellington
had
merely
repulsed
wellington
losses
in
the
battles
of
these
three
years
were
the
confederates
lost
in
the
valley
and
the
seven
days
and
in
the
campaign
against
pope
it
is
not
to
be
understood
however
that
the
duke
strategy
was
less
skilful
or
less
audacious
than
lee
and
jackson
during
these
three
years
his
army
largely
composed
of
portuguese
and
spaniards
was
incapable
of
offensive
tactics
against
his
veteran
enemies
and
he
was
biding
his
time
it
was
the
inefficiency
of
his
allies
and
the
miserable
support
he
received
from
the
english
government
that
prevented
him
until
from
adopting
a
bolder
policy
but
if
they
had
shown
that
the
best
defence
lies
in
a
vigorous
offensive
their
offensive
had
not
yet
been
applied
at
the
decisive
point
to
make
victory
complete
it
is
the
sounder
policy
to
carry
the
war
into
hostile
territory
a
nation
endures
with
comparative
equanimity
defeat
beyond
its
own
borders
pride
and
prestige
may
suffer
but
a
people
will
seldom
be
brought
to
the
point
of
making
terms
unless
its
army
is
annihilated
in
the
heart
of
its
own
country
unless
the
capital
is
occupied
and
the
hideous
sufferings
of
war
are
brought
directly
home
to
the
mass
of
the
population
a
single
victory
on
northern
soil
within
easy
reach
of
washington
was
far
more
likely
to
bring
about
the
independence
of
the
south
than
even
a
succession
of
victories
in
virginia
it
was
time
then
for
a
strategic
counterstroke
on
a
larger
scale
than
had
hitherto
been
attempted
the
opportunity
was
ripe
no
great
risk
would
be
incurred
by
crossing
the
potomac
there
was
no
question
of
meeting
a
more
powerful
enemy
the
federals
recruited
by
fresh
levies
would
undoubtedly
be
numerically
the
stronger
and
the
confederate
equipment
despite
the
large
captures
of
guns
and
rifles
was
still
deficient
but
for
deficiencies
in
numbers
and
in
materiel
the
higher
morale
and
the
more
skilful
leading
would
make
ample
compensation
it
might
safely
be
inferred
that
the
northern
soldiers
would
no
longer
display
the
cool
confidence
of
gaines
mill
or
even
of
malvern
hill
the
places
of
the
brave
and
seasoned
soldiers
who
had
fallen
would
be
filled
by
recruits
and
generals
who
had
been
on
so
many
might
fairly
be
expected
when
confronted
once
more
with
their
dreaded
opponents
to
commit
even
more
egregious
errors
than
those
into
which
they
had
already
fallen
september
such
were
the
ideas
entertained
by
lee
and
accepted
by
the
president
and
on
the
morning
of
september
as
soon
as
it
was
found
that
the
federals
had
sought
shelter
under
the
forts
of

jackson
was
instructed
to
cross
the
potomac
and
form
the
advanced
guard
of
the
army
of
invasion
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
feelings
he
issued
his
orders
for
the
march
on
leesburg
above
which
lay
an
easy
ford
for
more
than
twelve
months
since
the
very
morrow
of

had
persistently
advocated
an
aggressive
policy
in

memoirs
of
her

a
letter
is
quoted
from
her
giving
the
substance
of
a
conversation
with
general
jackson
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
this
letter
i
have
not
felt
justified
in
quoting
in
the
first
place
it
lacks
corroboration
in
the
second
place
it
contains
a
very
incomplete
statement
of
a
large
strategical
question
in
the
third
place
the
opinions
put
in
jackson
mouth
are
not
only
contradictory
but
altogether
at
variance
with
his
practice
and
lastly
it
attributes
certain
ideas
to
the
general
raising
the
black
flag
which
his
confidential
aid
officers
declare
that
he
never
for
a
moment
entertained
the
fierce
battles
round
richmond
and
manassas
he
had
looked
upon
as
merely
the
prelude
to
more
resolute
efforts
after
he
had
defeated
banks
at
winchester
he
had
urged
his
friend
colonel
boteler
to
inform
the
authorities
that
if
they
would
reinforce
him
he
would
undertake
to
capture
washington
the
message
had
been
conveyed
to
lee
tell
general
jackson
was
the
reply
of
the
that
he
must
first
help
me
to
drive
these
people
away
from
richmond
this
object
had
been
now
thoroughly
accomplished
and
general
lee
decision
to
redeem
his
promise
was
by
none
more
heartily
approved
than
by
the
leader
of
the
valley
army
and
yet
though
the
risks
of
the
venture
were
small
the
prospects
of
complete
success
were
dubious
the
opportunity
had
come
but
the
means
of
seizing
it
were
feeble
lee
himself
was
buoyed
up
by
no
certain
expectation
of
great
results
in
advocating
invasion
he
confessed
to
the
president
that
his
troops
were
hardly
fit
for
service
beyond
the
frontier
the
army
he
wrote
is
not
properly
equipped
for
an
invasion
of
the
enemy
territory
it
lacks
much
of
the
material
of
war
is
feeble
in
transportation
the
animals
being
much
reduced
and
the
men
are
poorly
provided
with
clothes
and
in
thousands
of

are
destitute
of

what
concerns
me
most
is
the
fear

not

learned
to
study
the
wants

of

were
harassed
by
the
ignorance
of
a
staff
that
was
still
and
the
commissariat

were
not
abreast
of
their
important
duties
more
than
all
the
operations

to
a
successful

been
most
arduous
and
the
strain
on
the
endurance
of
the
troops
not
yet
recovered
from
their
exertions
in
the
peninsula
had
been
so
great
that
a
period
of
repose
seemed
absolutely
necessary
it
was
not
only
that
battle
and
sickness
had
thinned
the
ranks
but
that
those
whose
health
had
been
proof
against
continued
hardships
and
whose
strength
and
spirit
were
still
equal
to
further
efforts
were
so
badly
shod
that
a
few
long
marches
over
indifferent
roads
were
certain
to
be
more
productive
of
casualties
than
a
pitched
battle
the
want
of
boots
had
already
been

it
has
been
said
that
the
route
of
the
confederate
army
from
the
rappahannock
to
chantilly
might
have
been
traced
by
the
stains
of
bloody
feet
along
the
highways
and
if
the
statement
is
more
graphic
than
exact
yet
it
does
not
fall
far
short
of
the
truth
many
a
stout
soldier
who
had
hobbled
along
on
his
bare
feet
until
pope
was
encountered
and
defeated
found
himself
utterly
incapable
of
marching
into
maryland
in
rear
of
the
army
the
roads
were
covered
with
stragglers
squads
of
infantry
banding
together
for
protection
toiled
along
painfully
by
easy
stages
unable
to
keep
pace
with
the
colours
but
hoping
to
be
up
in
time
for
the
next
fight
and
amongst
these
were
not
a
few
officers
but
this
was
not
the
worst
lax
discipline
and
the
absence
of
soldierly
habits
asserted
themselves
with
the
same
pernicious
effect
as
in
the
valley
not
all
the
stragglers
had
their
faces
turned
towards
the
enemy
not
all
were
incapacitated
by
physical
suffering

without
going
through
the
formality
of
asking
leave
were
making
for
their
homes
and
had
no
idea
that
their
conduct
was
in
any
way
peculiar
they
had
done
their
duty
in
more
than
one
battle
they
had
been
long
absent
from
their
farms
their
equipment
was
worn
out
the
enemy
had
been
driven
from
virginia
and
they
considered
that
they
were
fully
entitled
to
some
short
repose
and
amongst
these
whose
only
fault
was
an
imperfect
sense
of
their
military
obligations
was
the
residue
of
cowards
and
malingerers
shed
by
every
great
army
engaged
in
protracted
operations
lee
had
been
joined
by
the
divisions
of
hill
mclaws
walker
and
by
hampton
cavalry
and
the
strength
of
his
force
should
have
been
effectives
calculated
on
the
basis
of
the
field
returns
dated
july
with
the
addition
of
jackson
and
ewell
divisions
and
subtracting
the
losses
of
the
campaign
against
pope
but
it
was
evident
that
these
numbers
could
not
be
long
maintained
the
men
were
already
accustomed
to
of
green
corn
and
they
would
be
no
worse
off
in
maryland
and
pennsylvania
untouched
as
yet
by
the
ravages
of
war
than
in
the
wasted
fields
of
virginia
the
most
ample
commissariat
however
would
not
compensate
for
the
want
of
boots
and
the
want
of
rest
and
a
campaign
of
invasion
was
certain
to
entail
an
amount
of
hard
marching
to
which
the
strength
of
the
troops
was
hardly
equal
not
only
had
the
south
to
provide
from
her
seven
millions
of
white
population
an
army
larger
than
that
of
imperial
france
but
from
a
nation
of
agriculturists
she
had
to
provide
another
army
of
craftsmen
and
mechanics
to
enable
the
soldiers
to
keep
the
field
for
guns
and
powder
and
ammunition
clothing
and
harness
gunboats
and
torpedoes
locomotives
and
railway
plant
she
was
now
dependent
on
the
hands
of
her
own
people
and
the
resources
of
her
own
soil
the
organisation
of
those
resources
scattered
over
a
vast
extent
of
territory
was
not
to
be
accomplished
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
nor
was
the
supply
of
skilled
labour
sufficient
to
fill
the
ranks
of
her
industrial
army
by
the
autumn
of
although
the
strenuous
efforts
of
every
government
department
gave
the
lie
to
the
idea
not
uncommon
in
the
north
that
the
southern
character
was
shiftless
and
the
southern
intellect
slow
so
little
real
progress
had
been
made
that
if
the
troops
had
not
been
supplied
from
other
sources
they
could
hardly
have
marched
at
all
the
captures
made
in
the
valley
in
the
peninsula
and
in
the
second
manassas
campaign

of
inestimable
value

exchanged

successor

at

of

were
partially
clothed
in
federal
uniforms
and
the
bad
quality
of
the

contractors
was
a
very
general
subject
of
complaint
in
the
southern
ranks
nor
while
the
men
were
fighting
were
the
women
idle
the
output
of
the
government
factories
was
supplemented
by
private
enterprise
thousands
of
long
silent
in
dusty
hummed
busily
in
mansion
and
in
farm
matrons
and
maids
from
the
wife
and
daughters
of
the
to
the
mother
of
the
became
weavers
and
seamstresses
and
in
every
household
of
the
confederacy
although
many
of
the
necessities
of
life
salt
coffee
and
sugar
had
become
expensive
luxuries
the
needs
of
the
army
came
before
all
else
but
notwithstanding
the
energy
of
the
government
and
the
patriotism
of
the
women
the
troops
lacked
everything
but
spirit
nor
even
with
more
ample
resources
could
their
wants
have
been
readily
supplied
in
any
case
this
would
have
involved
a
long
halt
in
a
secure
position
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
federal
strength
would
be
increased
by
fresh
levies
and
the
morale
of
their
defeated
troops
restored
but
even
had
time
been
given
the
government
would
have
been
powerless
to
render
substantial
aid
contingents
of
recruits
were
being
drilled
into
discipline
at
richmond
yet
they
hardly
exceeded
muskets
and
it
was
not
on
the
virginia
frontier
alone
that
the
south
was
hard
pressed
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
was
beset
by
great
armies
alabama
was
threatened
and
western
tennessee
was
strongly
occupied
it
was
already
difficult
to
find
a
safe
passage
across
the
river
for
the
supplies
furnished
by
the
prairies
of
texas
and
louisiana
and
communication
with
arkansas
had
become
uncertain
if
the
mississippi
were
lost
not
only
would
three
of
the
most
fertile
states
as
prolific
of
hardy
soldiers
as
of
fat
oxen
be
cut
off
from
the
remainder
but
the
enemy
using
the
river
as
a
base
would
push
his
operations
into
the
very
heart
of
the
confederacy
to
regain
possession
of
the
great
waterway
seemed
of
more
vital
importance
than
the
defence
of
the
potomac
or
the
secession
of
maryland
and
now
that
richmond
had
been
relieved
the
whole
energy
of
the
government
was
expended
on
the
operations
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
a
vigorous
endeavour
supported
by
all
the
means
available
and
even
by
troops
drawn
from
the
west
to
defeat
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
to
capture
washington
would
not
have
been
a
more
efficacious
means
to
the
same
end
but
davis
and
his
cabinet
consistently
preferred
dispersion
to
concentration
and
indeed
the
situation
of
the
south
was
such
as
might
well
have
disturbed
the
strongest
brains
the
of
the
union
was
telling
with
deadly
effect
although
the
most
important
strategic
points
on
the
mississippi
were
still
held
by
confederate
garrisons
nearly
every
mile
of
the
great
river
from
cairo
to
new
orleans
was
patrolled
by
the
federal
gunboats
and
in
deep
water
from
the
ports
of
the
atlantic
to
the
roadsteads
of
the
gulf
the
frigates
maintained
their
vigilant
blockade
even
on
the
northern
border
there
was
hardly
a
gleam
of
light
across
the
sky
the
federal
forces
were
still
formidable
in
numbers
and
a
portion
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
not
been
involved
in
defeat
it
was
possible
therefore
that
more
skilful
generalship
than
had
yet
been
displayed
by
the
northern
commanders
might
deprive
the
confederates
of
all
chance
of
winning
a
decisive
victory
yet
although
the
opportunity
of
meeting
the
enemy
with
a
prospect
of
success
might
never
offer
an
inroad
into
northern
territory
promised
good
results
maryland
still
strong
in
sympathy
with
the
south
might
be
induced
by
the
presence
of
a
southern
army
to
rise
against
the
union
the
federal
army
would
be
drawn
off
westward
from
its
present
position
and
so
long
as
it
was
detained
on
the
northern
frontier
of
virginia
nothing
could
be
attempted
against
richmond
while
time
would
be
secured
for
improving
the
defences
of
the
confederate
capital
the
shenandoah
valley
would
be
most
effectively
protected
and
its
produce
transported
without
risk
of
interruption
both
to
lee
army
and
to
richmond
to
obtain
such
advantages
as
these
was
worth
an
effort
and
lee
after
careful
consideration
determined
to
cross
the
potomac
the
movement
was
made
with
the
same
speed
which
had
characterised
the
operations
against
pope
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
passage
of
the
river
should
be
accomplished
before
the

had
time
to
discover
the

showed

it
is
possible
that

effect

swarmed

sorrel
the
companion
of
so
many
marches
was
lost
for
some
days
after
the
passage
of
the
potomac
but
the
confederacy
was
near
paying
a
heavy
price
for
the
good
grey
mare
when
jackson
first
mounted
her
a
band
struck
up
close
by
and
as
she
reared
the
girth
broke
throwing
her
rider
to
the
ground
fortunately
though
stunned
and
severely
bruised
the
general
was
only
temporarily
disabled
and
if
he
appeared
but
little
in
public
during
his
stay
in

his
inaccessibility
was
not
due
to

general
jackson
still
suffering
from
his
hurt
kept
to
his
tent
busying
himself
with
maps
and
official
papers
and
declined
to
see
visitors

however
when
he
had
been
called

two
young
girls
waylaid
him
paralysed
him
with
smiles
and
questions

jumped
into

drove
off
rapidly
leaving
him

he
was
seen
no

the
next
evening
sunday
he
went
with
his
staff
to
service
in
the
town
and
slept
soundly
as
he
admitted
to
his
wife
through
the
sermon
of
a
minister
of
the
german
reformed
church
the
minister
says
colonel
douglas
was
credited
with
much
loyalty
and
courage
because
he
had
prayed
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
very
presence
of
stonewall
jackson
well
the
general
did
hear
the
prayer
and
if
he
had
he
would
doubtless
have
felt
like
replying
as
general
ewell
did
when
asked
at
carlisle
pennsylvania
if
he
would
permit
the
usual
prayer
for
president
lincoln
i
sure
he
needs
it
but
it
was
not
for
long
that
the
confederates
were
permitted
to
repose
in
frederick
the
enemy
had
made
no
further
reply
to
the
passage
of
the
potomac
beyond
concentrating
to
the
west
of
washington
mcclellan
who
had
superseded
pope
was
powerless
owing
to
the
inefficiency
of
his
cavalry
to
penetrate
the
cordon
of
stuart
pickets
and
to
ascertain
even
approximately
the
dispositions
of
the
invading
force
he
was
still
in
doubt
if
the
whole
or
only
part
of
lee
army
had
crossed
into
maryland
and
whether
his
adversary
intended
to
attack
washington
by
the
left
bank
of
the
potomac
to
move
on
baltimore
or
to
invade
pennsylvania
were
questions
which
he
had
no
means
of
determining
this
uncertainty
compelled
him
to
move
cautiously
and
on
september
his
advanced
guard
was
still
twenty
miles
east
of
frederick
nevertheless
the
situation
of
the
confederates
had
become
suddenly
complicated
when
the
march
into
maryland
was
begun
three
towns
in
the
valley
were
held
by
the
federals
infantry
and
artillery
occupied
winchester
cavalry
were
at
martinsburg
and
ferry
in
process
of
conversion
into
an
intrenched
camp
had
a
garrison
of
men
lee
was
well
aware
of
the
presence
of
these
forces
when
he
resolved
to
cross
the
potomac
but
he
believed
that
immediately
his
advance
threatened
to
separate
them
from
the
main
army
and
to
leave
them
isolated
they
would
be
ordered
to
insure
their
safety
by
a
timely
retreat
had
it
depended
upon
mcclellan
this
would
have
been
done
halleck
however
thought
otherwise
and
the
officer
commanding
at
harper
ferry
was
ordered
to
hold
his
works
until
mcclellan
should
open
communication
with
him
on
arrival
at
frederick
therefore
the
confederates
contrary
to
anticipation
found
federals
still
established
in
their
rear
and
although
winchester
had
been
evacuated
on
the
night
of
september
lee
report
volume
part
page
it
was
clear
that
harper
ferry
was
to
be
defended
the
existence
of
the
intrenched
camp
was
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
full
development
of
lee
designs
his
line
of
communication
had
hitherto
run
from
rapidan
station
to
manassas
junction
and
thence
by
leesburg
and
point
of
rocks
to
frederick
this
line
was
within
easy
reach
of
washington
and
liable
to
be
cut
at
any
moment
by
the
cavalry
arrangements
had
therefore
been
already
made
to
transfer
the
line
to
the
valley
there
sheltered
by
the
blue
ridge
the
convoys
of
sick
and
wounded
of
arms
clothing
and
ammunition
could
move
in
security
from
staunton
to
shepherdstown
and
the
recruits
which
were
accumulating
at
richmond
be
sent
to
join
the
army
in
northern
territory
but
so
long
as
harper
ferry
was
strongly
garrisoned
this
new
line
would
be
liable
to
constant
disturbance
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
post
should
either
be
masked
by
a
superior
force
or
carried
by
a
coup
de
main
the
first
of
these
alternatives
was
at
once
rejected
for
the
confederate
numbers
were
too
small
to
permit
any
permanent
detachment
of
a
considerable
force
and
without
hesitation
lee
determined
to
adopt
the
bolder
course
men
he
considered
would
be
no
more
than
sufficient
to
effect
his
object
but
men
were
practically
half
the
army
and
the
plan
when
laid
before
the
generals
was
not
accepted
without
remonstrance
longstreet
indeed
went
so
far
as
to
refuse
command
of
the
detachment
i
objected
he
writes
and
urged
that
our
troops
were
worn
with
marching
and
were
on
short
rations
and
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
divide
our
forces
while
we
were
in
the
enemy
country
where
he
could
get
information
in
six
or
eight
hours
of
any
movement
we
might
make
the
federal
army
though
beaten
at
the
second
manassas
was
not
disorganised
and
it
would
certainly
come
out
to
look
for
us
and
we
should
guard
against
being
caught
in
such
a
condition
our
army
consisted
of
a
superior
quality
of
soldiers
but
it
was
in
no
condition
to
divide
in
the
enemy
country
i
urged
that
we
should
keep
it
in
hand
recruit
our
strength
and
get
up
supplies
and
then
we
could
do
anything
we
pleased
general
lee
made
no
reply
to
this
and
i
supposed
the
harper
ferry
scheme
was
abandoned

jackson
too
would
have
preferred
to
fight
mcclellan

consider
the
question

he
accepted
with

anderson
anderson

for

ferry
was
to
be
invested
on
three
sides
and
the
march
was
to
begin
at
daybreak
on
september
meanwhile
the
remainder
of
the
army
was
to
move
to
hagerstown
miles
from
frederick
where
it
would
alarm
lincoln
for
the
safety
of
pennsylvania
and
be
protected
from
mcclellan
by
the
parallel
ranges
of
the
catoctin
and
south
mountains
undoubtedly
in
ordinary
circumstances
general
longstreet
would
have
been
fully
justified
in
protesting
against
the
dispersion
of
the
army
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
hagerstown
and
harper
ferry
are
miles
apart
and

was
between
them
mcclellan
advanced
guard
on
the
other
hand
was
thirty
miles
from
harper
ferry
and
from
hagerstown
the
federals
were
advancing
slowly
and
cautiously
it
is
true
but
still
pushing
westward
and
it
was
certainly
possible
should
they
receive
early
intelligence
of
the
confederate
movements
that
before
harper
ferry
fell
a
rapid
march
might
enable
them
to
interpose
between
lee
and
jackson
but
both
lee
and
jackson
calculated
the
chances
with
a
surer
grasp
of
the
several
factors
had
the
general
in
command
of
the
federal
army
been
bold
and
enterprising
had
the
federal
cavalry
been
more
efficient
or
stuart
less
skilful
they
would
certainly
have
hesitated
before
running
the
risk
of
defeat
in
detail
but
so
long
as
mcclellan
controlled
the
movements
of
the
enemy
rapid
and
decisive
action
was
not
to
be
apprehended
and
it
was
exceedingly
improbable
that
the
scanty
and
unreliable
information
which
he
might
obtain
from
civilian
sources
would
induce
him
to
throw
off
his
customary
caution
moreover
only
a
fortnight
previously
the
federal
army
had
been
heavily
defeated
are
you
acquainted

said
lee
to

he
is
an
able
general
but
a
very
cautious
one
his
enemies
among
his
own
people
think
him
too
much
so
his
army
is
in
a
very
demoralised
and
chaotic
condition
and
will
not
be
prepared
for
offensive
operations
or
he
will
not
think
it
so
for

four
weeks

had
resolved

woo

was
in
the
mood
the
movement
against
harper
ferry
once
determined
it
was
essential
that
it
should
be
carried
out
with
the
utmost
speed
and
jackson
marched
with
even
more
than
ordinary
haste
but
without
omitting
his
usual
precautions
before
starting
he
asked
for
a
map
of
the
pennsylvania
frontier
and
made
many
inquiries
as
to
roads
and
localities
to
the
north
of
frederick
whereas
his
route
lay
in
the
opposite
direction
the
cavalry
which
preceded
the
column
says
colonel
douglas
had
instructions
to
let
no
civilian
go
to
the
front
and
we
entered
each
village
we
passed
before
the
inhabitants
knew
of

coming

two
very
pretty
girls
with
ribbons
of
red
white
and

floating
from

in

hands
rushed
out

we
passed
came
to
the
kerbstone
and
with
much
laughter
waved
their
flags
defiantly
in
the
face
of
the
general
he
bowed
raised
his
hat
and
turning
with
his
quiet
smile
to
the
staff
said
evidently
have
no
friends
in
this

having
crossed

mountain
at

gap
the
command
encamped
for
the
night
within
a
mile
of

fourteen
miles
from

here
general
jackson
must
determine
whether
he
would
go
to
williamsport
or
turn
towards
shepherdstown
i
at
once
rode
into
the
village
with
a
cavalryman
to
make
some
inquiries
but
we
ran
into
a
federal
squadron
who
without
ceremony
proceeded
to
make
war
upon
us
we
retraced
our
steps
and
although
we
did
not
stand
upon
the
order
of
our
going
a
squad
of
them
escorted
us
out
of
the
town
with
great
rapidity
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
we
discovered
just
over
it
general
jackson
walking
slowly
towards
us
leading
his
horse
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
fortunately
the
chase
had
become
less
vigorous
and
with
a
cry
of
command
to
unseen
troops
we
turned
and
charged
the
enemy
they
suspecting
trouble
turned
and
fled
while
the
general
quickly
galloped
to
the
rear
as
i
returned
to
camp
i
picked
up
the
gloves
which
he
had
dropped
in
mounting
and
took
them
to
him
although
he
had
sent
a
regiment
of
infantry
to
the
front
as
soon
as
he
went
back
the
only
allusion
he
made
to
the
incident
was
to
express
the
opinion
that
i
had
a
very
fast
horse
the
next
morning
having
learned
that
the
federal
troops
still
occupied
martinsburg
general
jackson
took
the
direct
road
to
williamsport
he
then
forded

with

followed
a
side
road
so
as
to
approach
martinsburg
from
the
west
and
encamped
four
miles
from
the
town
his
object
was
to
drive
general
white
who
occupied
martinsburg
towards
harper
ferry
and
thus
corral
all
the
federal
troops
in
that
military
pen
as
the
comte
de
paris
puts
it
he
organised
a
grand
hunting
match
through
the
lower
valley
driving
all
the
federal
detachments
before
him
and
forcing
them
to
crowd
into
the
blind
alley
of
harper
ferry
the
next
morning
the
confederates
entered
martinsburg
here
the
general
was
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
and
a
great
crowd
hastened
to
the
hotel
to
greet
him
at
first
he
shut
himself
up
in
a
room
to
write
dispatches
but
the
demonstration
became
so
persistent
that
he
ordered
the
door
to
be
opened
the
crowd
chiefly
ladies
rushed
in
and
embarrassed
the
general
with
every
possible
outburst
of
affection
to
which
he
could
only
reply
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
he
gave
them
his
autograph
in
books
and
on
scraps
of
paper
cut
a
button
from
his
coat
for
a
little
girl
and
then
submitted
patiently
to
an
attack
by
the
others
who
soon
stripped
the
coat
of
nearly
all
the
remaining
buttons
but
when
they
looked
beseechingly
at
his
hair
which
was
thin
he
drew
the
line
and
managed
to
close
the
interview
these
blandishments
did
not
delay
his
movements
however
for
in
the
afternoon
he
was
off
again

troops
bivouacked

banks

the

my

affidavit
twenty
years
ago
that
no

jackson
was
so
careful
that
no
one
should
learn
the
contents
of
the
order
that
the
copy
he
furnished
to

was
written
by
his
own

the
copy
found
by
the
federals
was
wrapped
round
three
cigars
and
was
signed
by
lee
he
was
within
twenty
miles
of

the
confederates
were
more
than
that
distance
apart
the
intrenched
camp
still
held
out
for
the
sound
of
mclaws
battle
on
the
maryland
heights
was
distinctly
heard
during
the
afternoon
and
a
resolute
advance
would
have
either
compelled
the
confederates
to
raise
the
siege
or
have
placed
the
federal
army
between
their
widely
separated
wings
but
happily
for
the

mcclellan
was
not
the
man
for
the
opportunity
he
still
hesitated

for
the
lost
order
see
note
at
end
of

the
roads
were
good
and
the
weather
fine
and
a
night
march
of
twelve

would
have
placed
the
federal
advanced
guards
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
ready
to
force
the
gaps
at
earliest

mcclellan
however
although
his
men
had
made
no
unusual
exertions
during
the
past
few
days
preferred
to
wait
till
daylight
nevertheless
on
the
night
of
the
disaster
threatened
the

harper
ferry
had
not
yet
fallen
and
in
addition
to
the
cavalry
hill

was
alone
available
to
defend
the

lee
however
still
relying
on
mcclellan
irresolution
determined
to
hold

thus
gaining

defended
by
several

it
was
so
far
from
the
summits
occupied
by
mclaws

walker
that
their
guns
although
directed
against
the
enemy
rear
could
hardly
render
effective

only
the
extremities
of
the
plateau
were
thoroughly
exposed
to

from
the

in
order
to
facilitate

a

while
his

jackson
it
appears
was
at
first
inclined
to
send
a
flag
of
truce
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
civilian
population
time
to
get
away
should
the
garrison
refuse
to
surrender
but
during
the
morning
heavy
firing
was
heard
to
the
northward
and
mclaws
reported
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
detach
troops
to
guard
his
rear
against
mcclellan
the
batteries
were
therefore
ordered
to
open
fire
on
the
federal
works
without
further
delay
according
to
general
walker
jackson
although
he
was
aware
that
mcclellan
had
occupied
frederick
not
over
twenty
miles
distant
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
his
old
classmate
had
overcome
his
prudential
instincts
and
attributed
the
sounds
of
battle
to
a
cavalry
engagement
it
is
certain
that
he
never
for
a
single
moment
anticipated
a
resolute
attempt
to
force
the
passages
of
the
south
mountain
for
in
reply
to
mclaws
he
merely
instructed
him
to
ask
general
hill
to
protect
his
rear
and
to
communicate
with
lee
at
hagerstown
had
he
entertained
the
slightest
suspicion
that
mcclellan
was
advancing
with
his
whole
force
against
the
passages
of
the
south
mountain
he
would
hardly
have
suggested
that
hill
would
be
asked
to
defend
crampton
as
well
as

full
confidence

he
would

enforce

to
join

the
further
bank

of
his

was
cautious

methodical
the
position
in

wrote
to

a
strong
one

i
desire
to
remain
quiet

let
you

draw
attention
from

so
that

may
have
an

the

were
rent
by

and
as
the
sun
rising
over
the

dispersed
the
vapour
the
whole
of

became
engaged
the
federal
batteries
worked
with
stubborn
courage
and
showing
a
bold
front
to
every
fresh
opponent
maintained
the
contest
for
an
hour
but
even
if
ammunition
had
not
failed
them
they
could
not
have
long
withstood
the
terrible
fire
which
took
them
in
front

the

there
seems
to
have
been
no
good
reason
even
admitting
the
heat
and
dust
that
longstreet

should
not
have
joined
him
at
noon
the
troops
marched
at
daylight
and
took
ten
hours
to
march
thirteen
miles
as
it
was
only
four
of
the
brigades
took
part
in
the
action
and
did
so
owing
to
their
late
arrival
in
very
disjointed
fashion

all

confederate
generals
appear
to
have
possessed
the
same
driving
power
as
jackson

had
been

had
forced
the

no

be
chagrined
with
the
result

his
operations
mcclellan
had
acted
with
unexpected
vigour
but
neither
in
strategy
nor
in
tactics
had
he
displayed
improvement
on
his
peninsular
methods
he
should
have
thrown
the
bulk
of
his
army
against
crampton

thus
intervening
between
lee
and
jackson

instead
of
doing
so
he
had
directed
men
against

had
the
attack
on

been
characterised
by

been
gained
for

on
the
other

the
position
at

had
become
untenable

during
the
night

to

september
this
enforced
retreat
was
not
without
effect
on
the
morale
of
either
army
mcclellan
was
as
exultant
as
he
was
credulous
i
have
just
learned
he
reported
to
halleck
at
on
the
from
general
hooker

that
the
enemy
is
making
for
shepherdstown

a
perfect

stated
publicly
that
he
must
admit
they
had
been
shockingly
whipped

am
hurrying
forward
to
endeavour
to
press
their
retreat

utmost

two
hours
later
information
this
moment
received

confirms
the
rout

demoralisation
of
the
rebel

is
stated
that
lee
gives
his
losses

we
are
following
as
rapidly

nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
mcclellan
whole

unaccustomed

the
general

volume
part
page
amongst
the
confederates
on
the
other
hand
there
was
some
depression
it
could
not
be
disguised
that
a
portion
of
the
troops
had
shown
symptoms
of
demoralisation
the
retreat
to
the
antietam
although
effectively
screened
by
fitzhugh

brigade
of
cavalry
was
not
effected
in
the
best
of
order
many
of
the
regiments
had
been
broken
by
the
hard
fighting
on
the
mountain
men
had
become
lost
in
the
forest
or
had
sought
safety
to
the
rear
and
the
number
of
stragglers
was
very
large
it
was
not
then
with
its
usual
confidence
that
the
army
moved
into

antietam

general
longstreet
indeed
was
of
opinion
that
the
army
should
have
recrossed
the
potomac
at
once
the
moral
effect
of
our
move
into
maryland
had
been
lost
by
our
discomfiture
at
south
mountain
and
it
was
evident
we
could
not
hope
to
concentrate
in
time
to
do
more
than
make
a
respectable
retreat

by
retiring
before

we
could
have
claimed

very
successful

so
spake
the
voice
of
prudence
lee
however
so
soon
as
he
was
informed
of
the
fall
of
harper
ferry
had
ordered
jackson
to
join
him
resolving
to
hold
his
ground
and
to
bring
mcclellan
to
a
decisive
battle
on
the
north
bank
of
the
potomac

men
for
lee
at
most
could
count
on
no
more

this
number

great
had
been

about
to
receive
the
attack
of
over
jackson
when
he
reached
sharpsburg
on
the
morning
of
the
heartily
approved
the
decision
and
it
is
worth
while
to
consider
the
reasons
which
led
them
to
disagree
with
longstreet
under
ordinary
conditions
to
expect
an
army
of
to
wrest
decisive
victory
from
one
of
enemies
would
be
to
demand
an
impossibility
the
defence
when
two
armies
are
equally
matched
is
physically
stronger
than
the
attack
although
we
have
napoleon
word
for
it
that
the
defence
has
the
harder
task
but
that
the
inherent
strength
of
the
defence
is
so
great
as
to
enable
the
smaller
force
to
annihilate
its
enemy
is
contrary
to
all
the
teaching
of
history
by
making
good
use
of
favourable
ground
or
by
constructing
substantial
works
the
smaller
force
may
indeed
stave
off
defeat
and
gain
time
but
it
can
hope
for
nothing
more
the
records
of
warfare
contain
no
instance
when
two
armies
were
of
much
the
same
quality
of
the
smaller
army
bringing
the
campaign
to
a
decisive
issue
by
defensive
tactics
wellington
and
lee
both
fought
many
defensive
battles
with
inferior
forces
but
neither
of
them
under
such
conditions
ever
achieved
the
destruction
of
their
enemy
they
fought
such
battles
to
gain
time
and
their
hopes
soared
no
higher
at
talavera
busaco
fuentes
where
the
french
were
superior
to
the
allies
wellington
repulsed
the
attack
but
he
did
not
prevent
the
defeated
armies
taking
the
field
again
in
a
few
days
at
the
wilderness
spotsylvania
the
north
anna
and
cold
harbour
the
great
battles
of
lee
maintained
his
ground
but
he
did
not
prevent
grant
moving
round
his
flank
in
the
direction
of
richmond
at
the
second
manassas
jackson
stood
fast
for
the
greater
part
of
two
days
but
he
would
never
have
driven
pope
across
bull
run
without
the
aid
of
longstreet
porter
at
gaines
mill
held
men
with
for
more
than
seven
hours
but
even
if
he
had
maintained
his
position
the
confederate
army
would
not
have
become
a
mob
of
fugitives
no
except
on
peculiarly
favourable
ground
or
when
defending
an
intrenched
camp
an
army
matched
with
one
of
equal
efficiency
and
numerically
superior
can
never
hope
for
decisive
success
so
circumstanced
a
wise
general
will
rather
retreat
than
fight
and
thus
save
his
men
for
a
more
favourable
opportunity
before
salamanca
for
instance
because
marmont
whose
strength
was
equal
to
his
own
was
about
to
be
reinforced
by
cavalry
wellington
had
determined
to
retreat
it
is
true
however
that
when
weaker
than
massena
whom
he
had
already
worsted
by
infantry
and
sabres
but
somewhat
stronger
in
artillery
he
stood
to
receive
attack
at
fuentes
yet
napier
declares
that
it
was
a
very
audacious
resolution
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
great
historian
told
him
that
to
pit
infantry
against
was
to
trust
too
much
to
fortune
but
lee
and
jackson
had
not
to
deal
with
ordinary
conditions
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
the
peninsula
and
in
the
valley
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
the
armies
in
maryland
were
by
no
means
equal
in
quality
the
federals
were
far
more
accustomed
to
retreat
than
advance
for
several
months
whether
they
were
engaged
on
the
shenandoah
on
the
chickahominy
on
the
rappahannock
or
on
bull
run
they
had
been
invariably
outmanoeuvered
their
losses
had
been
exceedingly
severe
not
only
in
battle
but
from
sickness
and
straggling
many
of
their
bravest
officers
and
men
had
fallen
with
the
exception
of
the
second
and
sixth
army
corps
commanded
by
sumner
and
by
franklin
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
had
been
involved
in
pope
defeat
and
they
had
not
that
trust
in
their
leaders
which
promises
a
strong
offensive
while
at
washington
the
army
had
been
reinforced
by
regiments
of
infantry
but
the
majority
of
these
troops
had
been
but
lately
raised
they
knew
little
of
drill
they
were
commanded
by
officers
as
ignorant
as
themselves
and
they
had
never
fired
a
musket
nor
were
the
generals
equal
in
capacity
to
those
opposing
them
if
a
student
of
history
says
a
northern
officer
familiar
with
the
characters
who
figured
in
the
war
of
secession
but
happening
to
be
ignorant
of
the
battle
of
antietam
should
be
told
the
names
of
the
men
who
held
high
commands
there
he
would
say
that
with
anything
like
equality
of
forces
the
confederates
must
have
won
for
their
leaders
were
men
who
made
great
names
in
the
war
while
the
federal
leaders
were
with
few
exceptions
men
who
never
became
conspicuous
or
became
conspicuous
only
through
failure
the
antietam
and
fredericksburg

palfrey

and
the
difference
in
military
capacity
extended
to
the
rank
and
file
when
the
two
armies
met
on
the
antietam
events
had
been
such
as
to
confer
a
marked
superiority
on
the
southerners
they
were
the
children
of
victory
and
every
man
in
the
army
had
participated
in
the
successes
of
lee
and
jackson
they
had
much
experience
of
battle
they
were
supremely
confident
in
their
own
prowess
for
the
fall
of
harper
ferry
had
made
more
than
amends
for
the
retreat
from
south
mountain
and
they
were
supremely
confident
in
their
leaders
no
new
regiments
weakened
the
stability
of
their
array
every
brigade
and
every
regiment
could
be
depended
on
the
artillery
which
had
been
but
lately
reorganised
in
battalions
had
under
the
fostering
care
of
general
pendleton
become
peculiarly
efficient
although
the
materiel
was
still
indifferent
and
against
stuart
horsemen
the
federal
cavalry
was
practically
useless
in
every
military
attribute
then
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
so
superior
to
the
army
of
the
potomac
that
lee
and
jackson
believed
that
they
might
fight
a
defensive
battle
outnumbered
as
they
were
with
the
hope
of
annihilating
their
enemy
they
were
not
especially
favoured
by
the
ground
and
time
and
means
for
intrenching
were
both
wanting
but
they
were
assured
that
not
only
were
their
veterans
capable
of
holding
the
position
but
if
favoured
by
fortune
of
delivering
a
counterstroke
which
should
shiver
the
army
of
the
potomac
into
a
thousand
fragments
by
retreating
across
the
potomac
in
accordance
with
general
longstreet
suggestion
lee
would
certainly
have
avoided
all
chances
of
disaster
but
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
abandoned
a
good
hope
of
ending
the
war
the
enemy
would
have
been
fully
justified
in
assuming
that
the
retrograde
movement
had
been
made
under
the
compulsion
of
his
advance
and
the
balance
of
morale
have
been
sensibly
affected
in
favour
of
the
federals
if
the
potomac
had
once
been
placed
between
the
opposing
forces
mcclellan
would
have
had
it
in
his
power
to
postpone
an
encounter
until
his
army
was
strongly
reinforced
his
raw
regiments
trained
and
his
troops
rested
the
passage
of
the
river
it
is
true
had
been
successfully
forced
by
the
confederates
on
september
but
it
by
no
means
followed
that
it
could
be
forced
for
the
second
time
in
face
of
a
concentrated
enemy
who
would
have
had
time
to
recover
his
morale
and
supply
his
losses
mcclellan
so
long
as
the
confederates
remained
in
maryland
had
evidently
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
but
if
maryland
was
evacuated
he
would
probably
content
himself
with
holding
the
line
of
the
potomac
and
in
view
of
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
armies
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
fortune
which
should
lay
him
open
to
assault
lee
and
jackson
were
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
the
wiser
policy
to
give
the
enemy
no
time
to
reorganise
and
recruit
but
to
coerce
him
to
battle
before
he
had
recovered
from
the
defeat
which
he
had
sustained
on
the
heights
above
bull
run
to
recross
the
potomac
would
be
to
slight
the
favours
of
fortune
to
abandon
the
initiative
and
to
submit
in
face
of
the
vast
numbers
of
fresh
troops
which
the
north
was
already
raising
to
a
defensive
warfare
a
warfare
which
might
protract
the
struggle
but
which
must
end
in
the
exhaustion
of
the
confederacy
mcclellan
own
words
are
the
strongest
justification
of
the
views
held
by
the
southern
leaders
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
thoroughly
exhausted
and
depleted
by
the
desperate
fighting
and
severe
marching
in
the
unhealthy
regions
of
the
chickahominy
and
afterwards
during
the
second
bull
run
campaign
its
trains
administrative
services
and
supplies
were
disorganised
or
lacking
in
consequence
of
the
rapidity
and
manner
of
its
removal
from
the
peninsula
as
well
as
from
the
nature
of
its
operations
during
the
second
bull
run
campaign
had
general
lee
remained
in
front
of
washington
south
of
the
potomac
it
would
have
been
the
part
of
wisdom
to
hold
our
own
army
quiet
until
its
pressing
wants
were
fully
supplied
its
organisation
was
restored
and
its
ranks
were
filled
with
recruits
in
brief
until
it
was
prepared
for
a
campaign
but
as
the
enemy
maintained
the
offensive
and
crossed
the
upper
potomac
to
threaten
or
invade
pennsylvania
it
became
necessary
to
meet
him
at
any
cost
notwithstanding
the
condition
of
the
troops
to
put
a
stop
to
the
invasion
to
save
baltimore
and
washington
and
throw
him
back

but

necessity
justified
the
advance

the
army
of
the
potomac
to
south
mountain
and
antietam

its
then
condition

purpose
of
advancing
from
washington
was
simply
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
moment
by
frustrating

of
the
northern
states
and
when
that
was
accomplished
to
push
with
the

rapidity
the
work

that

but
when
night
fell
upon
the
field
the
only
interchange
of
hostilities
had
been
a
brief
engagement
of
artillery
mcclellan
advance
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
passing
his
great
army
through
the
mountains
and
to
the
scarcity
of
roads

been
slow
and
tedious
in

of

had
so
disposed
his

the
federal

unenlightened
as
to
the
real
strength
of
his
adversary
believed
that
he
was
opposed
by

nor
was
the
next

all

estimate

their
character
was
absolutely
correct
while
mcclellan
was

jackson

back
he
could
not
have
appeared
more
composed

confident

simply
expressed

satisfaction

yet
the
reinforcements
which
jackson

had
brought
up
were
no
considerable
addition
to

strength
jones
division
consisted
of
no
more

therefore
the

to

we
may
add
for

the

undoubtedly
have

have
been
not

we
have
not

to
look
for
the
cause
of
this
reduction
many
of

absented

before
the

crossed
into

and
if
those
who
remained
with
the
colours
had
seen
little
fighting
since

defeat
they
had
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
inactivity
the
operations
which
resulted
in
the
capture
of

had
been
arduous
in
the
extreme

who
had
taken

declared
that
the
march
from

surpassed
all
their
former
experiences
in
days
they
had
covered
over
sixty
miles
crossing
two
mountain
ranges
and
fording
the
potomac
the
weather
had
been
intensely
hot
and
the
dust
was
terrible
nor
had
the
investment
of
harper
ferry
been
a
period
of
repose
they
had
been
under
arms
during
the
night
which
preceded
the
surrender
awaiting
the
signal
to
assault
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of

sentries
as
soon
as
the
terms
of
capitulation
were
arranged
they
had
been
hurried
back
to

bivouac
had
cooked
two
rations
and
shortly
after
midnight
had
marched
to
the
potomac
seventeen
miles
away
this
night
march
coming
on
the
top
of
their
previous
exertions
had
taxed
the
strength

beyond
endurance

badly
shod
many
were
not
shod
at
all
they
were

on

then
from

company
in

even
the
stonewall

though
it
had
still
preserved
its
five

was
reduced
to
muskets

but
little
stronger

although
less
hardly
used
in

campaign
than

troops
had
diminished
under
the
strain
of
the
night
march
and
mustered
no
more
than
officers
and
men
at
sharpsburg
thus
the
masses
of
troops
which
mcclellan
conceived
were
hidden
in
rear
of
hill
and
longstreet
amounted
in
reality
to
some
effective
soldiers
it
was
fortunate
indeed
that
in
their
exhausted
condition
there
was
no
immediate
occasion
for
their
services
on
september
the
shadows
grew
longer
but
yet
the
federals
made
no
move
even
the
fire
of
the
artillery
died
away
and
the
men
slept
quietly
in
the
woods
to
north
and
west
of
the
little
town
meanwhile
in
an
old
house
one
of
the
few
which
had
any
pretensions
to
comfort
in
sharpsburg
the
generals
met
in
council
staff
officers
strolled
to
and
fro
over
the
broad
brick
pavement
the
horses
stood
lazily
under
the
trees
which
shaded
the
dusty
road
and
within
lee
jackson
and
longstreet
pored
long
and
earnestly
over
the
map
of
maryland
during
the
bright
september
afternoon
but
before
the
glow
of
a
lovely
sunset
had
faded
from
the
sky
the
artillery
once
more
opened
on
the
ridge

came
in
that

at

to
meet

ordered
into

no
serious
collision

took

made
no

oppose

were
driven
in

a
speedy
reinforcement
restored
the
line
and
except
that
the
batteries
on
both
sides
took
part
the
fighting
was
little
more
than
an
affair
of
outposts
at
eleven
hood
brigades
were
withdrawn
to
cook
and
eat
division
filled
their
place
and
the
night
although
broken
by
constant
alarms
passed
away
without
further
conflict
the
federal
movements
had
clearly
exposed
their
intention
of
attacking

had
even
revealed

it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
not
only
were
the
number
of
the
opposing
armies
at
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
almost
identical
with
those
of
the
french
and
germans
at
the
battle
of
worth
but
that
there
is
no
small
resemblance
between
the
natural
features
and
surrounding
scenery
of
the
two
fields
full
in
front
of
the
confederate
position
rises
the
red
hill
a
spur
of
the
south
mountain
wooded
like
the
vosges
to
the
very
crest
and
towering
high
above
the
fields
of
maryland
as
the
hochwald
towers
above
the
rhineland
the
antietam
however
is
a
more
difficult
obstacle
than
the
sauerbach
the
brook
which
meanders
through
the
open
meadows
of
the
alsatian
valley
a
deep
channel
of
more
than
sixty
feet
in
width
is
overshadowed
by
forest
trees
and
the
ground
on
either
bank
ascends
at
a
sharp
gradient
to
the
crests
above
along
the
ridge
to
the
west
which
parts
the
antietam
from
the
potomac
and
about
a
mile
distant
from
the
former
stream
runs
the
hagerstown
turnpike
and
in
front
of
this
road
there
was
a
strong
position
sharpsburg
a
village
of
a
few
hundred
inhabitants
lies
on
the
reverse
slope
of
the
ridge
extending
in
the
direction
of
the
potomac
and
only
the
church
steeples
were
visible
to
the
federals
above
the
hamlet
was
the
confederate
centre
here
near
a
limestone
boulder
which
stood
in
a
plot
which
is
now
included
in
the
soldiers
cemetery
was
station
during
the
long
hours
of
september
and
from
this
point
he
overlooked
the
whole
extent
of
his
line
of
battle
a
mile
northward
on
the
hagerstown
pike
his
loft
centre
was
marked
by
a
square
white
building
famous
under
the
name
of
the
dunkard
church
and
backed
by
a
long
dark
wood
to
the
right
a
mile
southward
a
bold
spur
covered
with
scattered
trees
forces
the
antietam
westward
and
on
this
spur
overlooking
the
stream
he
had
placed
his
right
map
of
sharpsburg
maryland
between
the
hagerstown
pike
and
the
antietam
the
open
slopes
although
not
always
uniform
but
broken
like
those
on
the
french
side
of
the
sauerbach
by
long
ravines
afforded
an
admirable
field
of
fire
the
lanes
which
cross
them
are
sunk
in
many
places
below
the
surface
in
front
of
sharpsburg
the
fields
were
divided
by
low
stone
walls
and
these
natural
intrenchments
added
much
to
the
strength
of
the
position
nor
were
they
the
only
advantages
the
belt
of
oaks
beyond
the
dunkard
church
the
west
wood
was
peculiarly
adapted
for
defence
parallel
ledges
of
outcropping
limestone
both
within
the
thickets
and
along
the
hagerstown
road
rising
as
high
as
a
waist
gave
good
coyer
from
shot
and
shell
the
trees
were
of
old
growth
and
there
was
little
underwood
to
the
however
and
about
five
hundred
yards
distant
across
the
fields
lay
the
east
wood
covering
the
slopes
to
the
antietam
with
poffenberger
wood
beyond
while
further
to
the
left
the
north
wood
extending
across
the
hagerstown
pike
approached
the
confederate
flank
the
enemy
if
he
advanced
to
the
attack
in
this
quarter
of
the
field
would
thus
find
ample
protection
during
his
march
and
deployment
and
in
case
of
reverse
he
would
find
a
in
the
north
and
poffenberger
woods
of
which
hooker
was
already
in
possession
in
the
space
between
the
woods
were
several
small
farms
surrounded
by
orchards
and
stone
fences
and
on
the
slope
east
of
the
dunkard
church
stood
a
few
cottages
and
barns
access
to
the
position
was
not
easy
only
a
single
ford
near
snaveley
house
exists
across
the
antietam
and
this
was
commanded
by
the
bluff
on
the
confederate
right
the
stone
bridges
however
for
want
of
time
and
means
to
destroy
them
had
been
left
standing
that
nearest
the
confluence
of
the
antietam
and
the
potomac
at
the
antietam
by
which
p
hill
was
expected
was
defended
by
and
enfiladed
by
artillery
the
next
known
as
the
burnside
bridge
was
completely
overlooked
by
the
heights
above
that
opposite
lee
centre
could
be
raked
throughout
its
length
but
the
fourth
at
pry
mill
by
which
hooker
and
mansfield
had
already
crossed
was
covered
both
from
view
and
fire
roads
within
the
position
were
numerous
the
hagerstown
turnpike
concealed
for
some
distance
on
either
side
of
sharpsburg
by
the
crest
of
the
ridge
was
admirably
adapted
for
the
movement
of
reserves
and
another
broad
highway
ran
through
sharpsburg
to
the
potomac
the
position
then
in
many
respects
was
well
adapted
to
purpose
the
flanks
were
reasonably
secure
the
right
rested
on
the
antietam
the
left
was
more
open
but
the
west
wood
formed
a
strong
point
and
beyond
the
wood
a
low
ridge
rising
above
nicodemus
run
gave
room
for
several
batteries
while
the
potomac
was
so
close
that
the
space
available
for
attack
on
this
flank
was
much
restricted
the
ground
could
thus
be
held
by
a
comparatively
small
number
of
men
and
a
large
reserve
set
free
for
the
counterstroke
the
great
drawback
was
that
the
ridge
east
of
the
antietam
although
commanded

the

which

was
not
unfavourable
for
defence
although
the
troops
had
practically
no
cover
except
the

the
rocky

there
was
a
wide
and

the

opening
with

resistance
of

for

became
the
scene

lee
had
promised
further
reinforcements
a
glance
southward
showed
that
there
was
no
reason
for
despair
over
all
the
field
lay
the
heavy
smoke
of
a
great
artillery
battle
from
near
the
dunkard
church
to
the
bluff
overhanging
the
antietam
a
distance
of
two
miles

was
in

under
stephen
lee
together
with
the
guns
of
cutts

battalion
guns
in
all
the
divisional
batteries
of
hill
and
the
washington
artillery
of
new
orleans
both
hill
and
the
washington
artillery
had
sixteen
guns
each
and
in
addition
to
these
eighty
guns
others
were
in
action
above
the
burnside
bridge
an
array
even
more
formidable
crowned
the
opposite
crest
but
although
the
confederate
batteries
opposed
by
larger
numbers
and
heavier
metal
had
suffered
terribly
both
in
men
and
in
materiel
yet
the
infantry
the
main
strength
of
the
defence
was
still
intact
our
artillery
says
general
hill
could
not
cope
with
the
superior
weight
calibre
range
and
number
of
the
yankee
guns
hence
it
ought
only
to
have
been
used
against
masses
of
infantry
on
the
contrary
our
guns
were
made
to
reply
to
the
yankee
guns
and
were
smashed
up
or
withdrawn
before
they
could
be
effectually
turned
against
massive
columns
of
attack
after
sharpsburg
lee
gave
orders
that
there
were
to
be
no
more
duels
so
long
as
the
confederates
fought
defensive
battles
the
cliffs
of
the
red
hill
replying
to
the
rolling
thunder
of
near
guns
gave
back
no
echo
to
the
sharper
crack
of
musketry
save
a
few
skirmishers
who
had
crossed
the
sharpsburg
bridge
not
one
company
of
mcclellan
infantry
had
been
sent
into
action
south
of
the
dunkard
church
beyond
the
antietam
covering
the
whole
space
between
the
river
and
the
hills
the
blue
masses
were
plainly
to
be
seen
through
the
drifting
smoke
some
so
far
in
the
distance
that
only
the
flash
of
steel
in
the
bright
sunshine
distinguished
them
from
the
surrounding
woods
others
moving
in
dense
columns
towards
the

standards
on

men
on

in
slow
succession
still
but
neither
by
the
sharpsburg
nor
yet
by
the
burnside
bridge
had
a
single
federal
regiment
crossed
the
stream
lee
centre
and
right
were
not
even
threatened
and
it
was
evident
his
reserves
might
be
concentrated
without
risk
at
whatever
point
he
pleased
walker
division
was
therefore
withdrawn
from
the
right
and
mclaws
who
had
reached
sharpsburg
shortly
after
sunrise
was
ordered
to
the
front
anderson
brigade
was
detached
from
hill
and
the
whole
force
was
placed
at
jackson
disposal
these
fresh
troops
together
with
early
regiments
not
yet
engaged
gave
muskets
for
the
counterstroke
and
had
hooker
and
mansfield
been
alone
upon
the
field
the
federal
right
wing
would
have
been
annihilated
but
as
the
confederate
reserves
approached
the
dunkard
church
sumner
whom
mcclellan
had
ordered
to
cross
pry
bridge
with
the
second
army
corps
threw
three
divisions
against
the
west
wood
and
the
roulette
house
in
three
lines
up
the
slope
from
the
antietam
at
sixty
yards
distance
and
covering
a
wide
front
came
sedgwick
on
the
right
french
on
the
left
and
richardson
to
the
left
rear
so
orderly
was
the
advance
of
those
northerners
and
so
imposing
their
array
that
even
the
confederate
officers
watched
their
march
with
admiration
and
terrible
was
the
shock
with
which
they
renewed
the
conflict
sedgwick
emerging
from
the
east
wood
moved
directly
over
the
crossed
the
turnpike
and
entering
the
west
wood
to
northward
of
the
point
still
held
by
greene
swept
through
the
timber
and
with
a
portion
of
his
advanced
brigade
reached
the
further
edge
greene
at
the
same
moment
moved
upon
the
dunkard
church
and
early
who
with
the
fragments
of
jones
division
was
alone
within
the
wood
marched
rapidly
in
the
same
direction
attacked
suddenly
in
flank
from
behind
a
ridge
of
rock
regiments
were
driven
back
and
then
early
observing
third
line
pushing
across
the
turnpike
reformed
his
troops
for
further
action
greene
for
the
moment
had
been
disposed
of
but
a
more
formidable
attack
was
threatening
sedgwick
muskets
confronted
only
by
some
letter
of
jackson
memoirs
of
pendleton
page
of
the
valley
soldiers
under
grigsby
were
thronging
through
the
wood
and
a
change
of
front
southward
would
have
sent
them
sweeping
down
the
confederate
line
early
could
hardly
have
withstood
their
onset
hood
was
incapable
of
further
effort
and
hill
was
heavily
pressed
by
french
but
jackson
hand
still
held
the
reins
of
battle
during
the
fierce
struggle
of
the
morning
he
had
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
west
wood
leaving
as
was
his
wont
the
conduct
of
the
divisions
to
his
subordinates
but
watching
his
enemy
with
a
glance
that
saw
beyond
the
numbers
arrayed
against
him
he
had
already
demanded
reinforcements
from
general
lee
and
in
anticipation
of
their
speedy
arrival
their
orders
had
been
already
framed
they
had
not
been
called
for
to
sustain
his
front
or
to
occupy
a
new
position
despite
the
thronging
masses
of
the
federals
despite
the
fact
that
his
line
was
already
broken
attack
and
attack
only
was
in
jackson
mind
and
the
reserves
and
the
opportunity
arrived
together
a
staff
officer
was
dispatched
to
direct
walker
on
the
left
to
sustain
the
texans
to
clear
the
west

to

reformed

after

the

supreme
in

with

across

cornfield
the
grey
lines

rose

the
southern
yell
pealing

with

fell
round
them

the
masses
of
the
enemy
melted
away
like
the
morning
mist
has
been
very
kind
to
us
this
day
but
the
end
was
not
yet
sedgwick

flying
to
the
rallied
under
the
fire
of

batteries
and
as
the
confederates
advanced
upon
the

wood
they
found
it
already
occupied
by
a
fresh
brigade
smith
division
of
the
sixth
corps
had
been
sent
forward
by
mcclellan
to
sustain
the
battle
and
its
arrival
saved
his
army
from
defeat
once
more
the
became
the
scene
of
a
furious
struggle
the
southerners
fighting
for
decisive
victory
the
federals
for
existence
so
impetuous
was
mclaws
attack
that
the
regiments
on
his
left
although
checked
by
the
fences
drove
in
a
battery
and
dashed
back
the
enemy
first
line
but
the
weight
of
the
artillery
in
front
of
the
north
wood
supported
by
a
portion
of
smith
division
prevented
further
advance
and
a
federal
brigade
handled
with
rare
judgment
rushed
forward
to
meet
the
assailants
in
the
open
sharp
was
the
conflict
for
mclaws
a
fine
soldier
as
daring
as
he
was
skilful
strove
fiercely
to
complete
the
victory
but
the
fight
within
the
woods
and
the
swift
pursuit
had
broken
the
order
of
his
division
brigade
had
mingled
with
brigade
regiment
with
regiment
there
were
no
supports
and
the
broken
ranks
scourged
by
the
terrible
of
many
batteries
were
unable
to
withstand
the
solid
impact
of
the
federal
reserve
slowly
and
sullenly
the
troops
fell
back
from
the
deadly
strife
the
enemy
no
less
exhausted
halted
and
lay
down
beyond
the
turnpike
and
while
the
musketry
once
more
died
away
to
northward
of
the
dunkard
church
jackson
rallying
his
brigades
his
line
along
the
edge
of
the
west
wood
near
the

was
a
portion
of
walker
division
further
north
were
two
of
mclaws
brigades
then
armistead
who
had
been
sent
forward
from
sharpsburg
and
then
early
a
brigade
of
division
formed
the
second
line
and
anderson
was
sent
back
to
hill
hood
also
was
withdrawn
and
the
survivors
of
jones
division
many
of
whom
had
shared
in
the
counterattack
were
permitted
to
leave
the
front
their
rifles
were
no
longer
needed
for
from
ten
onwards
so
far
as
the
defence
of
the
confederate
left
was
concerned
the
work
was
done
for
many
hours
the
west
wood
was
exposed
to
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
federal
artillery
but
this
fire
although
the
range
was
close
varying
from
six
to
fifteen
hundred
yards
had
little
effect
the
shattered
branches
fell
incessantly
among
the
recumbent
ranks
and
the
shells
exploding
in
the
foliage
sent
their
hissing
fragments
far
and
wide
yet
the
losses
so
more
than
one
general
reported
were
surprisingly
small
but
although
the
enemy
infantry
had
been
repulsed
no
immediate
endeavour
was
made
by
the
confederates
to
initiate
a
fresh
counterstroke
when
lee
sent
mclaws
and
walker
to
jackson
aid
he
sent
in
his
last
reserve
for
hill
had
not
yet
reached
the
field
and
anderson
division
had
already
been
taken
to
support
the
centre
thus
no
fresh
troops
were
available
and
the
federal
right
was
strong
at
least
fifteen
batteries
of
artillery
were
in
position
along
the
edge
of
the
north
wood
and
they
were
powerfully
supported
by
the
heavy
guns
beyond
the
stream
yet
the
infantry
so
effectively
protected
was
only
formidable
by
reason
of
its
numbers
the
first
corps
and
the
twelfth
no
longer
existed
as
organised
bodies
it
was
not
until
two
that
even
meade
pennsylvanians
were
reformed
sedgwick
division
of
the
second
corps
was
still
more
shattered
only
smith
division
was
effective
and
general
mcclellan
acting
on
the
advice
of
sumner
forbade
all
further
attack
slocum
division
of
the
sixth
corps
which
reached
the
east
wood
at
twelve
was
ordered
to
remain
in
rear
as
support
to
smith
the
confederate
left
wing
then
had
offered
such
strenuous
resistance
that
eight
divisions
of
infantry
more
than
half
of
mcclellan
army
lay
paralysed
before
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
infantry
at
the
lowest
calculation
and
probably
guns
besides
those
across
the
antietam

been
massed
by

quarter

a
liberal
estimate
of
his
strength

the

on

sides

estimate
but
although
the
confederate
casualties
were
not
greatly
exceeded
by
those
of
the
enemy
and
were
much
larger
in
proportion
to
their
strength
the
federals
had
lost
more
than
mere
numbers
the
morale
of
the
troops
had
suffered
and
still
more
the
morale
of
the
leaders
even
sumner
bravest
of
men
had
been
staggered
by
the
fierce
assault
which
had
driven
sedgwick
troops
like
sheep
across
the
nor
was
mcclellan
disposed
to
push
matters
to
extremity
over
in
the
west
wood
on
the
other
hand
discouragement
had
no
place
jackson
had
not
yet
abandoned
hope
of
sweeping
the
enemy
from
the
field
he
was
disappointed
with
the
partial
success
of
counterstroke
it
had
come
too
late
the
fortuitous
advance
of
smith
division
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
struggle
had
in
all
human
probability
rescued
the
federal
right
from
a
terrible
defeat
had
mclaws
been
able
to
reach
the
east
wood
he
would
have
compelled
the
hostile
batteries
to
retreat
the
federal
infantry
already
shattered
and
disorganised
could
hardly
have
held
on
and
the
line
would
have
been
broken
through
but
although
one
opportunity
had
been
lost
and
he
was
once
more
thrown
on
the
defensive
determination
to
make
the
battle
decisive
of
the
war
was
still
unshaken
his
judgment
was
never
clearer
shortly
before
eleven
his
medical
director
appalled
by
the
number
of
wounded
men
sent
back
from
the
front
and
assured
that
the
day
was
going
badly

to
the
west
wood
in
order
to
discuss
the
advisability
of
transferring
the
field
hospitals
across
the
potomac
mcguire
found
jackson
sitting
quietly
on
sorrel
behind
the
line
of
battle
and
some
peaches
he
had
brought
with
him
were
gratefully
accepted
he
then
made
his
report
and
his
apprehensions
were
not
made
less
by
the
weakness
of
the
line
which
held
the
wood
the
men
in
many
places
were
lying
at
intervals
of
several
yards
for
support
there
was
but
one
small
brigade
and
over
in
the
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
federal
masses
was
terribly
apparent
yet
his
imperturbable
commander
apparently
paying
more
attention
to
the
peaches
than
to
his
subordinate
suggestions
replied
by
pointing
to
the
enemy
and
saying
quietly
mcguire
they
have
done
their
worst

the
tide
of

battle
raged
fiercely
about
the
sunken

which
was
held
by

which
witnessed
on
this
day
such
of
slaughter
that
it

the

was
stormed
longstreet
fell
back
to
the
turnpike
through
the
wreck
of
the
artillery
but
at
this
critical
juncture
the
federals
halted
they
had
not
been
supported
by
their
batteries
richardson
had
received
a
mortal
wound
and
a
succession
of
rough
counterstrokes
had
thinned
their
ranks
here
too
the
musketry
dwindled
to
a
spattering
fire
and
the
opposing
forces
both
reduced
to
the
defensive
lay
watching
each
other
through
the
long
hours
of
the
afternoon
a
threat
of
a
federal
advance
from
the
sharpsburg
bridge
came
to
nothing
four
batteries
of
regulars
preceded
by
a
force
of
infantry
pushed
across
the
stream
and
came
into
action
on
either
side
of
the
boonsboro
road
but
on
the
slopes
above
strongly
protected
by
the
walls
evans
brigade
stood
fast
lee
sent
up
a
small
support
and
the
enemy
confined
his
movements
to
a
demonstration
still
further
to
the
south
however
the
battle
blazed
out
at
one
with
unexpected
fury
the
federal
attack
recoiling
first
from
jackson
and
then
from
longstreet
swung
round
to
the
confederate
right
and
it
seemed
as
if
mcclellan
plan
was
to
attempt
each
section
of
lee
line
in
succession
burnside
had
been
ordered
to
force
the
passage
of
the
bridge
at
nine
but
either
the
difficulty
of
the
task
or
his
inexperience
in
handling
troops
on
the
offensive
delayed
his
movements
and
when
the
attack
was
made
it
was
fiercely
met
by
four
confederate
brigades
at
length
well
on
in
the
afternoon
three
federal
divisions
crowned
the
spur
and
driving
longstreet
right
before
them
made
good
their
footing
on
the
ridge
sharpsburg
was
below
them
the
southern
infantry
outflanked
and
roughly
handled
was
falling
back
in
confusion
upon
the
town
and
although
lee
had
assembled
a
group
of
batteries
in
the
centre
and
regiments
were
hurrying
from
the
left
disaster
seemed
imminent
but
strong
assistance
was
at
hand
hill
who
had
forded
the
potomac
and
crossed
the
antietam
by
the
lower
bridge
after
a
forced
march
of
seventeen
miles
in
eight
hours
from
harper
ferry
hill
received
his
orders
at
and
marched
an
hour
later
reaching
the
about
attacked
without
waiting
for
orders
and
struck
the
federals
in
flank
with
bayonets
by
this
brilliant
counterstroke
burnside
was
repulsed
and
the
position
saved
northern
writers
have
laid
much
stress
on
this
attack
had
burnside
displayed
more
or
hill
less
energy
the
confederates
they
assert
could
hardly
have
escaped
defeat
it
is
certainly
true
that
longstreet
four
brigades
had
been
left
to
bear
the
brunt
of
burnside
assault
without
further
support
than
could
be
rendered
by
the
artillery
they
were
not
so
left
however
because
it
was
impossible
to
aid
them
jackson
and
longstreet
troops
despite
the
fiery
ordeal
through
which
they
had
passed
were
not
yet
powerless
and
the
confederate
leaders
were
prepared
for
offensive
tactics
a
sufficient
force
to
sustain
the
right
might
have
been
withdrawn
from
the
left
and
centre
but
hill
approach
was
known
and
it
was
considered
inadvisable
to
abandon
all
hold
of
the
means
for
a
decisive
counterstroke
on
the
opposite
flank
early
in
the
afternoon
longstreet
had
given
orders
for
an
advance
division
with
full
had
reappeared
upon
the
field
jones
and
lawton
divisions
were
close
behind
the
batteries
had
replenished
their
ammunition
and
if
longstreet
was
hardly
warranted
in
arranging
a
general
on
his
own
responsibility
he
had
at
least
full
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
troops
to
execute
it
it
seemed
probable
he
says
that
by
concealing
our
movements
under
cover
of
the
west
wood
we
could
draw
our
columns
so
near
to
the
enemy
to
the
front
that
we
would
have
but
a
few
rods
to
march
to
mingle
our
ranks
with
his
that
our
columns
massed
in
goodly
numbers
and
pressing
heavily
upon
a
single
point
would
give
the
enemy
much
trouble
and
might
cut
him
in
two
breaking
up
his
battle
arrangements
at
burnside
bridge
from
manassas
to
appomattox
pages
the
stroke
against
the
centre
was
not
however
to
be
tried
lee
had
other
views
and
jackson
had
been
already
ordered
to
turn
the
federal
right
stuart
reinforced
by
a
regiment
of
infantry
and
several
light
batteries
was
instructed
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
position
and
if
favourable
ground
were
found
he
was
to
be
supported
by
all
the
infantry
available
about
twelve
says
general
walker
i
sought
jackson
to
report
that
from
the
front
of
my
position
in
the
wood
i
thought
i
had
observed
a
movement
of
the
enemy
as
if
to
pass
through
the
gap
where
i
had
posted
colonel
cooke
two
regiments
i
found
jackson
in
rear
of
barksdale
brigade
under
an
apple
tree
sitting
on
his
horse
with
one
leg
thrown
carelessly
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
plucking
and
eating
the
fruit
without
making
any
reply
to
my
report
he
asked
me
abruptly
can
you
spare
me
a
regiment
and
a
battery
adding
that
he
wished
to
make
up
from
the
different
commands
on
our
left
a
force
of
four
or
five
thousand
men
and
give
them
to
stuart
with
orders
to
turn
the
enemy
right
and
attack
him
in
the
rear
that
i
must
give
orders
to
my
division
to
advance
to
the
front
and
attack
the
enemy
as
soon
as
i
should
hear
stuart
guns
and
that
our
whole
left
wing
would
move
to
the
attack
at
the
same
time
then
replacing
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
said
with
great
emphasis
we
drive
mcclellan
into
the
potomac
returning
to
my
command
i
repeated
general
jackson
order
to
my
brigade
commanders
and
directed
them
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
stuart
guns
we
all
confidently
expected
to
hear
the
welcome
sound
by
two
at
least
and
as
that
hour
approached
every
ear
was
on
the
alert
napoleon
at
waterloo
did
not
listen
more
intently
for
the
sound
of
grouchy
fire
than
did
we
for
stuart
two
came
but
nothing
was
heard
of
stuart
two
and
then
three
and
still
stuart
made
no
sign
about
three
a
staff
officer
of
general
brought
me
an
order
to
advance
and
attack
the
enemy
in
my
front
as
the
execution
of
this
order
would
have
materially
interfered
with
jackson
plans
i
thought
it
my
duty
before
beginning
the
movement
to
communicate
with
general
longstreet
personally
i
found
him
in
rear
of
the
position
in
which
i
had
posted
cooke
in
the
morning
and
upon
informing
him
of
jackson
intentions
he
withdrew
his
order
while
we
were
discussing
this
subject
jackson
himself
joined
us
with
the
information
of
stuart
failure
to
turn
the
federal
right
for
the
reason
that
he
found
it
securely
posted
on
the
potomac
upon
my
expressing
surprise
at
this
statement
jackson
replied
that
he
also
had
been
surprised
as
he
had
supposed
the
potomac
much
further
away
but
he
remarked
that
stuart
had
an
excellent
eye
for
topography
and
it
must
be
as
he
represented
it
is
a
great
pity
he
added
we
should
have
driven
mcclellan
into
the
potomac
battles
and
leaders
volume
pages
and
that
a
counterstroke
which
would
have
combined
a
frontal
and
flank
attack
would
have
been
the
best
chance
of
destroying
the
federal
army
can
hardly
be
questioned
the
front
so
bristled
with
field
artillery
and
the
ridge
beyond
the
antietam
was
so
strong
in
heavier
ordnance
that
a
purely
frontal
attack
such
as
longstreet
suggested
was
hardly
promising
but
the
dispositions
which
baffled
stuart
were
the
work
of
a
sound
tactician
thirty
rifled
guns
had
been
assembled
in
a
single
battery
a
mile
north
of
the
west
wood
where
the
hagerstown
turnpike
ascends
a
commanding
ridge
and
the
broad
channel
of
the
potomac
is
within
nine
hundred
yards
here
had
rallied
such
portions
of
hooker
army
corps
as
had
not
dispersed
and
here
mansfield
two
divisions
had
reformed
and
although
the
infantry
could
hardly
have
opposed
a
resolute
resistance
the
guns
were
ready
to
repeat
the
lesson
of
malvern
hill
against
the
rifled
pieces
the
light
confederate
were
practically
useless
stuart
caution
was
fully
justified
and
the
sun
sank
on
an
indecisive
battle
the
blessed
night
came
and
brought
with
it
sleep
and
forgetfulness
and
refreshment
to
many
but
the
murmur
of
the
night
wind
breathing
over
fields
of
wheat
and
clover
was
mingled
with
the
groans
of
the
countless
sufferers
of
both
armies
who
can
tell
who
can
even
imagine
the
horrors
of
such
a
night
while
the
unconscious
stars
shone
above
and
the
unconscious
river
went
rippling
by
general
palfrey
the
antietam
and
fredericksburg
out
of
men
upon
the
ground
had
been
killed
or
wounded
more
than
sixteen
per
cent
and
of
the
federals
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
engaged
the
losses
of
the
confederate
left
have
already
been
enumerated
those
of
the
centre
and
the
right
although
hill
reported
only
casualties
had
hardly
been
less
severe
in
all
officers
and
men
of
the
total
strength
had
fallen
and
many
of
the
regiments
had
almost
disappeared
one
does
not
look
for
humour
in
a
stern
story
like
this
but
the
charleston
courier
account
of
the
battle
contains
the
following
statement
the
confederates
fought
until
they
were
cut
to
pieces
and
then
retreated
only
because
they
had
fired
their
last
round
general
palfrey
the
antietam
and
fredericksburg
the
virginia
for
instance
of
longstreet
command
took
into
battle
officers
and
men
of
these
officers
and
men
were
killed
or
wounded
and
taken
prisoners
leaving
officers
and
men
to
represent
a
regiment
which
was
over
strong
at
bull
run
yet
as
the
men
sank
down
to
rest
on
the
line
of
battle
so
exhausted
that
they
could
not
be
awakened
to
eat
their
rations
as
the
blood
cooled
and
the
tension
on
the
nerves
relaxed
and
even
the
officers
faint
with
hunger
and
sickened
with
the
awful
slaughter
looked
forward
with
apprehension
to
the
morrow
from
one
indomitable
heart
the
hope
of
victory
had
not
yet
vanished
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
more
oppressive
than
the
stunning
roar
of
battle
lee
still
mounted
stood
on
the
highroad
to
the
potomac
and
as
general
after
general
rode
in
wearily
from
the
front
he
asked
quietly
of
each
how
is
it
on
your
part
of
the
line
each
told
the
same
tale
their
men
were
worn
out
the
enemy
numbers
were
overwhelming
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
retreat
across
the
potomac
before
daylight
even
jackson
had
no
other
counsel
to
offer
his
report
was
not
the
less
impressive
for
his
quiet
and
respectful
tone
he
had
had
to
contend
he
said
against
the
heaviest
odds
he
had
ever
met
many
of
his
divisional
and
brigade
commanders
were
dead
or
wounded
and
his
loss
had
been
severe
hood
who
came
next
was
quite
unmanned
he
exclaimed
that
he
had
no
men
left
great
god
cried
lee
with
an
excitement
he
had
not
yet
displayed
where
is
the
splendid
division
you
had
this
morning
they
are
lying
on
the
field
where
you
sent
them
was
the
reply
for
few
have
straggled
my
division
has
been
almost
wiped
out
after
all
had
given
their
opinion
there
was
an
appalling
silence
which
seemed
to
last
for
several
minutes
and
then
general
lee
rising
erect
in
his
stirrups
said
gentlemen
we
will
not
cross
the
potomac
you
will
go
to
your
respective
commands
strengthen
your
lines
send
two
officers
from
each
brigade
towards
the
ford
to
collect
your
stragglers
and
get
them
up
many
have
come
in
i
have
had
the
proper
steps
taken
to
collect
all
the
men
who
are
in
the
rear
if
mcclellan
wants
to
fight
in
the
morning
i
will
give
him
battle
again
go
without
a
word
of
remonstrance
the
group
broke
up
leaving
their
great
commander
alone
with
his
responsibility
and
says
an
eyewitness
if
i
read
their
faces
aright
there
was
not
one
but
considered
that
general
lee
was
taking
a
fearful
risk
communicated
by
general
stephen
lee
who
was
present
at
the
conference
so
the
soldiers
sleep
was
undisturbed
through
the
september
night
they
lay
beside
their
arms
and
from
the
dark
spaces
beyond
came
the
groans
of
the
wounded
and
the
nameless
odours
of
the
not
often
has
the
night
looked
down
upon
a
scene
more
terrible
the
moon
rising
above
the
mountains
revealed
the
long
lines
of
men
and
guns
stretching
far
across
hill
and
valley
waiting
for
the
dawn
to
shoot
each
other
down
and
between
the
armies
their
dead
lay
in
such
numbers
as
civilised
war
has
seldom
seen
so
fearful
had
been
the
carnage
and
comprised
within
such
narrow
limits
that
a
federal
patrol
it
is
related
passing
into
the
where
the
fighting
had
been
fiercest
believed
that
they
had
surprised
a
whole
confederate
brigade
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
woods
lay
the
skirmishers
their
muskets
beside
them
and
there
in
regular
ranks
lay
the
line
of
battle
sleeping
as
it
seemed
the
profound
sleep
of
utter
exhaustion
but
the
first
man
that
was
touched
was
cold
and
lifeless
and
the
next
and
the
next
it
was
the
bivouac
of
the
dead
september
when
the
day
dawned
the
confederate
divisions
reinforced
by
some
or
stragglers
held
the
same
position
as
the
previous
evening
and
over
against
them
seen
dimly
through
the
mist
lay
the
federal
lines
the
skirmishers
crouching
behind
the
shattered
fences
confronted
each
other
at
short
range
the
guns
of
both
armies
were
unlimbered
and
the
masses
of
infantry
further
to
the
rear
lay
ready
for
instant
conflict
but
not
a
shot
was
fired
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
heavens
the
warm
breath
of
the
autumn
morning
rustled
in
the
woods
but
still
the
same
strange
silence
prevailed
the
men
spoke
in
undertones
watching
intently
the
movements
of
staff
officers
and
orderlies
but
the
ranks
lay
as
still
as
the
inanimate
forms
half
hidden
by
the
trodden
corn
which
lay
so
thickly
between
the
lines
and
as
the
hours
passed
on
without
stir
or
shot
the
southern
generals
acknowledged
that
lee
daring
in
offering
battle
was
fully
justified
the
enemy
aggressive
strength
was
evidently
exhausted
and
then
arose
the
question
could
the
confederates
attack
it
would
seem
that
the
possibility
of
a
great
counterstroke
had
already
been
the
subject
of
debate
and
that
lee
despite
the
failure
of
the
previous
evening
and
jackson
adverse
report
believed
that
the
federal
right
might
be
outflanked
and
overwhelmed
during
the
morning
writes
general
stephen
lee
a
courier
from
headquarters
came
to
my
battalion
of
artillery
with
a
message
that
the
wished
to
see
me
i
followed
the
courier
and
on
meeting
general
lee
he
said
colonel
lee
i
wish
you
to
go
with
this
courier
to
general
jackson
and
say
that
i
sent
you
to
report
to
him
i
replied
general
shall
i
take
my
batteries
with
me
he
said
no
just
say
that
i
told
you
to
report
to
him
and
he
will
tell
you
what
he
wants
i
soon
reached
general
jackson
he
was
dismounted
with
but
few
persons
round
him
he
said
to
me
colonel
lee
i
wish
you
to
take
a
ride
with
me
and
we
rode
to
the
left
of
our
lines
with
but
one
courier
i
think
we
soon
reached
a
considerable
hill
and
dismounted
general
jackson
then
said
let
us
go
up
this
hill
and
be
careful
not
to
expose
yourself
for
the
federal
sharpshooters
are
not
far
off
the
hill
bore
evidence
of
fierce
fight
the
day
before
evidently
the
ridge
which
had
been
held
by
stuart
on
the
a
battery
of
artillery
had
been
on
it
and
there
were
wrecked
caissons
broken
wheels
dead
bodies
and
dead
horses
around
general
jackson
said
colonel
i
wish
you
to
take
your
glasses
and
carefully
examine
the
federal
line
of
battle
i
did
so
and
saw
a
remarkably
strong
line
of
battle
with
more
troops
than
i
knew
general
lee
had
after
locating
the
different
batteries
unlimbered
and
ready
for
action
and
noting
the
strong
skirmish
line
in
front
of
the
dense
masses
of
infantry
i
said
to
him
general
that
is
a
very
strong
position
and
there
is
a
large
force
there
he
said
yes
i
wish
you
to
take
fifty
pieces
of
artillery
and
crush
that
force
which
is
the
federal
right
can
you
do
it
i
can
scarcely
describe
my
feelings
as
i
again
took
my
glasses
and
made
an
even
more
careful
examination
i
at
once
saw
such
an
attempt
must
fail
more
than
fifty
guns
were
unlimbered
and
ready
for
action
strongly
supported
by
dense
lines
of
infantry
and
strong
skirmish
lines
advantageously
posted
the
ground
was
unfavourable
for
the
location
of
artillery
on
the
confederate
side
for
to
be
effective
the
guns
would
have
to
move
up
close
to
the
federal
lines
and
that
too
under
fire
of
both
infantry
and
artillery
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
say
all
that
i
felt
and
knew
i
said
yes
general
where
will
i
get
the
fifty
guns
he
said
how
many
have
you
i
replied
about
twelve
out
of
the
thirty
i
carried
into
the
action
the
day
before
my
losses
had
been
very
great
in
men
horses
and
carriages
he
said
i
can
furnish
you
some
and
general
lee
says
he
can
furnish
some
i
replied
shall
i
go
for
the
guns
no
not
yet
he
replied
colonel
lee
can
you
crush
the
federal
right
with
fifty
guns
i
said
general
i
can
try
i
can
do
it
if
anyone
can
he
replied
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you
sir
if
i
give
you
fifty
guns
can
you
crush
the
federal
right
i
evaded
the
question
again
and
again
but
he
pressed
it
home
finally
i
said
general
you
seem
to
be
more
intent
upon
my
giving
you
my
technical
opinion
as
an
artillery
officer
than
upon
my
going
after
the
guns
and
making
the
attempt
yes
sir
he
replied
and
i
want
your
positive
opinion
yes
or
no
i
felt
that
a
great
crisis
was
upon
me
and
i
could
not
evade
it
i
again
took
my
glasses
and
made
another
examination
i
waited
a
good
while
with
jackson
watching
me
intently
i
said
general
it
can
not
be
done
with
fifty
guns
and
the
troops
you
have
near
here
in
an
instant
he
said
let
us
ride
back
colonel
i
felt
that
i
had
positively
shown
a
lack
of
nerve
and
with
considerable
emotion
begged
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
make
the
attempt
saying
general
you
forced
me
to
say
what
i
did
unwillingly
if
you
give
the
fifty
guns
to
any
other
artillery
officer
i
am
ruined
for
life
i
promise
you
i
will
fight
the
guns
to
the
last
extremity
if
you
will
only
let
me
command
them
jackson
was
quiet
seemed
sorry
for
me
and
said
it
is
all
right
colonel
everybody
knows
you
are
a
brave
officer
and
would
fight
the
guns
well
or
words
to
that
effect
we
soon
reached
the
spot
from
which
we
started
he
said
colonel
go
to
general
lee
and
tell
him
what
has
occurred
since
you
reported
to
me
describe
our
ride
to
the
hill
your
examination
of
the
federal
position
and
my
conversation
about
your
crushing
the
federal
right
with
fifty
guns
and
my
forcing
you
to
give
your
opinion
with
feelings
such
as
i
never
had
before
nor
ever
expect
to
have
again
i
returned
to
general
lee
and
gave
a
detailed
account
of
my
visit
to
general
jackson
closing
with
the
account
of
my
being
forced
to
give
my
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
success
i
saw
a
shade
come
over
general
lee
face
and
he
said
colonel
go
and
join
your
command
for
many
years
i
never
fully
understood
my
mission
that
day
or
why
i
was
sent
to
general
jackson
when
jackson
report
was
published
of
the
battle
i
saw
that
he
stated
that
on
the
afternoon
of
september
general
lee
had
ordered
him
to
move
to
the
left
with
a
view
of
turning
the
federal
right
but
that
he
found
the
enemy
numerous
artillery
so
judiciously
posted
in
their
front
and
so
near
the
river
as
to
render
such
an
attempt
too
hazardous
to
undertake
i
afterwards
saw
general
stuart
report
in
which
he
says
that
it
was
determined
the
enemy
not
attacking
to
turn
the
enemy
right
on
the
it
appears
general
lee
ordered
general
jackson
on
the
evening
of
the
to
turn
the
enemy
right
and
jackson
said
that
it
could
not
be
done
it
also
appears
from
stuart
report
and
from
the
incident
i
relate
that
general
lee
reiterated
the
order
on
the
and
told
jackson
to
take
fifty
guns
and
crush
the
federal
right
jackson
having
reported
against
such
attempt
on
the
no
doubt
said
that
if
an
artillerist
in
whom
general
lee
had
confidence
would
say
the
federal
right
could
be
crushed
with
fifty
guns
he
would
make
the
attempt
i
now
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
opinion
which
i
was
forced
to
give
on
september
had
already
been
given
by
jackson
on
the
evening
of
september
and
that
the
same
opinion
was
reiterated
by
him
on
september
and
confirmed
by
general
stuart
on
the
same
day
i
still
believe
that
jackson
stuart
and
myself
were
right
and
that
the
attempt
to
turn
the
federal
right
either
on
the
or
on
the
would
have
been
unwise
the
incident
shows
general
lee
decision
and
boldness
in
battle
and
general
jackson
delicate
loyalty
to
his
commanding
general
in
convincing
him
of
the
inadvisability
of
a
proposed
movement
which
he
felt
it
would
be
hazardous
to
undertake
communicated
to
the
author
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
attack
of
which
jackson
was
aware
on
the
night
of
the
probably
led
to
his
advising
retreat
when
lee
asked
his
opinion
at
the
conference
ante
pages
the
federal
left
protected
by
the
antietam
was
practically
inaccessible
and
on
receiving
from
the
artillery
officers
lips
the
confirmation
of
jackson
report
lee
was
fain
to
relinquish
all
hope
of
breaking
mcclellan
line
the
troops
however
remained
in
line
of
battle
but
during
the
day
information
came
in
which
made
retreat
imperative
the
federals
were
being
reinforced
humphrey
division
hitherto
held
back
at
frederick
by
orders
from
washington
had
marched
over
south
mountain
couch
division
which
mcclellan
had
left
to
observe
harper
ferry
had
been
called
in
and
a
large
force
of
militia
was
assembling
on
the
pennsylvania
border
before
evening
therefore
lee
determined
to
evacuate
his
position
and
during
the
night
the
army
of
northern
virginia
with
all
its
trains
and
artillery
recrossed
the
potomac
at
boteler
ford
such
was
the
respect
which
the
hard
fighting
of
the
confederates
had
imposed
upon
the
enemy
that
although
the
rumbling
of
heavy
vehicles
and
the
tramp
of
the
long
columns
were
so
distinctly
audible
in
the
federal
lines
that
they
seemed
to
wakeful
ears
like
the
steady
flow
of
a
river
not
the
slightest
attempt
was
made
to
interfere
it
was
not
till
the
morning
of
the
that
a
federal
battalion
reconnoitring
towards
sharpsburg
found
the
ridge
and
the
town
deserted
and
although
jackson
who
was
one
of
the
last
except
the
cavalry
scouts
to
cross
the
river
did
not
reach
the
virginia
shore
till
eight
not
a
shot
was
fired
at
him
nor
were
the
trophies
gathered
by
the
federals
considerable
several
hundred
badly
wounded
men
were
found
in
sharpsburg
and
a
number
of
stragglers
were
picked
up
but
neither
gun
nor
waggon
had
been
left
upon
the
field
the
retreat
despite
many
obstacles
was
as
successfully
as
skilfully
executed
the
night
was
very
dark
and
a
fine
rain
which
had
set
in
towards
evening
soon
turned
the
heavy
soil
into
tenacious
mud
the
ford
was
wide
and
beset
with
boulders
and
the
only
approach
was
a
narrow
lane
but
the
energetic
quartermaster
of
the
valley
army
major
harman
made
light
of
all
difficulties
and
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
lee
and
jackson
the
crossing
was
effected
without
loss
or
misadventure
september
just
before
nightfall
however
under
cover
of
a
heavy
artillery
fire
the
federals
pushed
a
force
of
infantry
across
the
ford
drove
back
the
two
brigades
which
with
thirty
pieces
of
artillery
formed
the
confederate
and
captured
four
guns
emboldened
by
this
partial
success
mcclellan
ordered
porter
to
put
three
brigades
of
the
fifth
army
corps
across
the
river
the
next
morning
and
reconnoitre
towards
winchester
the
news
of
the
disaster
to
his
was
long
in
reaching
headquarters
his
army
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
confusion
and
fatigue
of
the
retreat
the
bivouacs
of
the
divisions
were
several
miles
from
the
river
and
were
widely
scattered
the
generals
were
ignorant
of
each
other
dispositions
no
arrangements
had
been
made
to
support
the
in
case
of
emergency
the
greater
part
of
the
cavalry
had
been
sent
off
to
williamsport
fifteen
miles
up
stream
with
instructions
to
cross
the
potomac
and
delay
the
advance
by
demonstration
the
brigadiers
had
no
orders
many
of
the
superior
generals
had
not
told
their
subordinates
where
they
would
be
found
and
the
commander
of
the
general
pendleton
had
not
been
informed
of
the
strength
of
the
infantry
placed
at
his
disposal
on
the
part
of
the
staff
worn
out
by
the
toils
and
anxieties
of
the
past
few
days
there
appears
to
have
been
a
general
failure
and
had
mcclellan
calculating
on
the
chances
invariably
offered
by
an
enforced
retreat
pushed
resolutely
forward
in
strong
force
success
might
possibly
have
followed
september
lee
on
receiving
pendleton
report
long
after
midnight
sent
off
orders
for
jackson
to
drive
the
enemy
back
when
the
messenger
arrived
jackson
had
already
ridden
to
the
front
he
too
had
received
news
of
the
capture
of
the
guns
and
ordering
hill
and
early
commanding
ewell
division
vice
lawton
wounded
at
sharpsburg
who
were
in
camp
near
martinsburg
to
march
at
once
to
shepherdstown
he
had
gone
forward
to
reconnoitre
the
movements
when
lee
courier
found
him
he
was
on
the
shepherdstown
road
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
divisions
and
watching
unattended
by
a
single
the
advance
of
porter
infantry
he
had
at
once
grasped
the
situation
the
confederates
were
in
no
condition
to
resist
an
attack
in
force
the
army
was
not
concentrated
the
cavalry
was
absent
no
reconnaissance
had
been
made
either
of
lines
of
march
or
of
positions
the
roads
were
still
blocked
by
the
trains
the
men
were
exhausted
by
their
late
exertions
and
depressed
by
their
retreat
and
the
straggling
was
terrible
the
only
chance
of
safety
lay
in
driving
back
the
enemy
advanced
guard
across
the
river
before
it
could
be
reinforced
and
the
chance
was
seized
without
an
instant
hesitation
the
federals
advanced
leisurely
for
the
cavalry
which
should
have
led
the
way
had
received
its
orders
too
late
to
reach
the
rendezvous
at
the
appointed
hour
and
the
infantry
compelled
to
reconnoitre
for
itself
made
slow
progress
porter
leading
brigade
was
consequently
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
river
when
the
light
division
reported
to
jackson
hill
was
ordered
to
form
his
troops
in
two
lines
and
with
early
in
close
support
to
move
at
once
to
the
attack
the
federals
confronted
by
a
large
force
and
with
no
further
object
than
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
the
confederate
army
made
no
attempt
to
hold
their
ground
their
left
and
centre
composed
mainly
of
regulars
withdrew
in
good
order
the
right
hampered
by
broken
country
was
slow
to
move
and
hill
soldiers
who
had
done
much
at
sharpsburg
with
but
little
loss
were
confident
of
victory
the
federal
artillery
beyond
the
river
included
many
of
their
heavy
batteries
and
when
the
long
lines
of
the
southerners
appeared
in
the
open
they
were
met
by
a
storm
of
shells
but
without
a
check
even
to
close
the
gaps
in
the
ranks
or
to
give
time
to
the
batteries
to
reply
to
the
enemy
fire
the
light
division
pressed
forward
to
the
charge
the
conflict
was
short
the
northern
regulars
had
already
passed
the
ford
and
only
a
brigade
of
volunteers
was
left
on
the
southern
bank
bringing
up
his
reserve
regiment
the
federal
general
made
a
vain
effort
to
prolong
his
front
hill
answered
by
calling
up
a
brigade
from
his
second
line
and
then
outnumbered
and
outflanked
the
enemy
was
driven
down
the
bluffs
and
across
the
river
the
losses
in
this
affair
were
comparatively
small
the
federals
reported
killed
and
wounded
and
of
these
a
raw
regiment
armed
with
condemned
enfield
rifles
accounted
for
no
less
than
hill
casualties
were
yet
the
engagement
was
not
without
importance
jackson
quick
action
and
resolute
advance
convinced
the
enemy
that
the
confederates
were
still
dangerous
and
mcclellan
disturbed
by
stuart
threat
against
his
rear
abandoned
all
idea
of
crossing
the
potomac

six

fighting
had
brought
both
belligerents
to
the
last
stage

flying

armies

lee
gathering
in
his
stragglers
left
stuart
to
cover
his
front
and
fell
back
towards
winchester
mcclellan
was
content
with
seizing
the
maryland
heights
at
harper
ferry
and
except
the
cavalry
patrols
not
a
single
federal
soldier
was
sent
across
the
river
the
organisation
was
absolutely
imperative
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
in
no
condition
to
undertake
the
invasion
of
virginia
not
only
had
the
losses
in
battle
been
very
large
but
the
supply
train
hurriedly
got
together
after
pope
defeat
had
broken
down
in
every
arm
there
was
great
deficiency
of
horses
the
troops
especially
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
peninsula
were
and
badly
shod
and
above
all
the
army
was
very
far
from
sharing
conviction
that
sharpsburg
was
a
brilliant
victory
the
men
in
the
ranks
were
not
so
easily
deceived
as
their
commander
mcclellan
relying
on
a
return
drawn
up
by
general
banks
now
in
command
at
washington
estimated
the
confederate
army
at
men
and
his
official
reports
made
frequent
mention
of
lee
overwhelming
strength
lincoln
had
long
before
this
recognised
the
tendency
of
mcclellan
and
others
to
exaggerate
the
enemy
strength
as
a
deputation
from
new
england
was
one
day
leaving
the
white
house
a
delegate
turned
round
and
said
president
i
should
much
like
to
know
what
you
reckon
to
be
the
number
the
rebels
have
in
arms
against
us
without
a
moment
hesitation
lincoln
replied
sir
i
have
the
best
possible
reason
for
knowing
the
number

the

although

abandoned

move
in

opinion
the

could

defeat

point
i
would

was
not
with

the

of
accepting

was

the
stake
was
greater
to
achieve

some

it

says

this

no

would
have
been
no

consequently
much
less

unwonted

at

in

can
not

move

when
it
was
reported
that
the
federal
general
had
boldly
advanced
against
the
strong
position
on

mountain
but
neither
lee
nor
jackson
was
aware
that
mcclellan
had
exact
information
of
their
dispositions
and
that
the
carelessness
of
a
confederate
staff
officer
had
done
more
for
the
union
than
all
the
northern
scouts

spies
in

jackson
had
been
disposed
to
leave
a
larger
margin
for
accidents
than
his

he
would
have
left

alone
and
have
fought
the
federals
in

and
he
was
probably
right
for
in
the
gettysburg
campaign
of
the
following
year
when

again
crossed
the

harper
ferry
was
ignored
although
occupied
by
a
strong
garrison
and
neither
in
advance
nor
retreat
were
the
confederate
communications
troubled
but
as
to
the
wisdom
of
giving
battle
on
the
antietam
after
the
fall
of
harper
ferry
there
was
no
divergence
of
opinion
between
lee
and
his
lieutenant
they
had
no
reason
to
respect
the
union
army
as
a
weapon
of
offence
and
very
great
reason
to
believe
that
mcclellan
was
incapable
of
wielding
it
their
anticipations
were
well
founded
the
federal
attack
was
badly
designed
and
badly
executed
if
it
be
compared
with
the
german
attack
at
worth
the
defects
of
mcclellan
the
defects
of
his
subordinates
the
want
of
sound
training
throughout
the
whole
army
become
at
once
apparent
on
august
there
was
certainly
early
in
the
day
much
disjointed
fighting
due
in
great
part
to
the
difficulties
of
the
country
the
absence
of
the
crown
prince
and
the
anxiety
of
the
generals
to
render
each
other
loyal
support
but
when
once
the
appeared
upon
the
field
and
assuming
direction
of
the
battle
infused
harmony
into
the
operations
the
strength
and
unity
of
the
attack
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed

responsibility

and

such
due

the
characteristic
mark
of
a

took
place
in

and
yet
he
was
unable
to
take
advantage

had
still
to
grasp
the
elementary
rule
that
the
combination
of
superior
numbers
and
of
all
arms
against
a
single
point
is
necessary
to
win
battles
the
northern

indeed
had

i
introduced

we
were
all
seated
in

and
he
took
up
the
conversation
he
had
been
to
england
and
had
been
greatly
impressed
with
the
architecture
of
durham
cathedral
and
with
the
history

been
palatines

there
is

history
of

in
blackstone
and
coke

i
can

fountains

law
anyhow

the
englishmen
in
detail
about

and
the
rights

bishops
etc
etc
he
gave
them
no

kept
them
busy
answering
questions
for
he
knew
more
about
durham
than
they
did
as
we
rode
away
i
said
gentlemen
you

to
me

i
been
carefully
observing
him
for

year

you
have
made
him

finesse
for
he
did
all
the
talking
to
keep
you
from

curious
or
embarrassing
questions
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
in
him
before
we
all
laughed

agreed
that
the
general
had
been
too
much
for
the
interviewers
memoirs
pages
and
the
soldiers
of
the

however
did
not

staff
officer
was
horrified
at
the
irreverent
reception
of
his
nicely
twisted
moustache
as
he
heard
from
behind
innumerable
trees
take
them
mice
out
o
your
mouth
take
out
no
use
to
say
they
there
see
their
tails
hanging
out
another
sporting
immense
whiskers
was
urged
to
come
out
o
that
bunch
of
hair
i
know
in
there
i
see
your
ears
so
the
soldiers
chaffed
the
dandies
and
the
camp
rang
with
laughter
fun
and
frolic
were
always
in
the
air
and
the
fierce
fighters
of
sharpsburg
behaved
like
schoolboys
on
a
holiday
but
when
the
general
rode
by
the
men
remembered
the
victories
they
had
won
and
to
whom
they
owed
them
the
hardships
they
had
endured
and
who
had
shared
them
and
the
appearance
of
sorrel
was
the
sure
precursor
of
a
scene
of
the
wildest
enthusiasm
the
horse
soon
learned
what
the
cheers
implied
and
directly
they
began
he
would
break
into
a
gallop
as
if
to
carry
his
rider
as
quickly
as
possible
through
the
embarrassing
ordeal
but
the
soldiers
were
not
to
be
deterred
by
their
modesty
and
whenever
he
was
compelled
to
pass
through
the
bivouacs
the
same
tribute
was
so
invariably
offered
that
the
sound
of
a
distant
cheer
rolling
down
the
lines
of
the
second
army
corps
always
evoked
the
exclamation
boys
look
out
here
comes
old
stonewall
or
an
old
hare
these
being
the
only
individuals
writes
one
of
jackson
soldiers
who
never
failed
to
bring
down
the
whole
house
nothing
could
express
more
clearly
the
loyalty
of
the
soldiers
to
their
general
than
this
quaint
estimate
of
his
popularity
the
is
averse
to
the
unrestrained
display
of
personal
affection
and
when
his
natural
reluctance
is
overborne
by
irrepressible
emotion
he
attempts
to
hide
it
by
a
jest
so
veterans
laughed
at
his
peculiarities
at
his
dingy
uniform
his
battered
cap
his
respect
for
clergymen
his
punctilious
courtesy
and
his
blushes
they
delighted
in
the
phrase
when
a
distant
yell
was
heard
here
old
jack
or
a
rabbit
they
delighted
more
in
his
confusion
when
he
galloped
through
the
shouting
camp
here
he
comes
they
said
we
make
him
take
his
hat
off
they
invented
strange
fables
of
which
he
was
the
hero
stonewall
died
ran
one
of
the
most
popular
and
two
angels
came
down
from
heaven
to
take
him
back
with
them
they
went
to
his
tent
he
was
not
there
they
went
to
the
hospital
he
was
not
there
they
went
to
the
outposts
he
was
not
there
they
went
to
the
he
was
not
there
so
they
had
to
return
without
him
but
when
they
reported
that
he
had
disappeared
they
found
that
he
had
made
a
flank
march
and
reached
heaven
before
them
another
was
to
the
effect
that
whereas
moses
took
forty
years
to
get
the
children
of
israel
through
the
wilderness
old
jack
would
have
them
through
in
three
days
on
half
rations
but
nevertheless
beneath
this
affectation
of
hilarity
lay
a
deep
and
passionate
devotion
and
two
incidents
which
occurred
at
this
time
show
the
extent
of
this
feeling
and
at
least
one
reason
for
its
existence
on
october
writes
major
heros
von
borcke
of
the
cavalry
division
i
was
honoured
with
the
pleasing
mission
of
presenting
to
stonewall
as
a
slight
token
of
stuart
high
regard
a
new
uniform
coat
which
had
just
arrived
from
the
hands
of
a
richmond
tailor
starting
at
once
i
reached
the
simple
tent
of
our
great
general
just
in
time
for
dinner
i
found
him
in
his
old
coat
from
which
all
the
buttons
had
been
clipped
by
the
fair
hands
of
patriotic
ladies
and
which
from
exposure
to
sun
rain
and
and
by
reason
of
many
rents
and
patches
was
in
a
very
unseemly
condition
when
i
had
dispatched
more
important
matters
i
produced
general
stuart
present
in
all
its
magnificence
of
gilt
buttons
and
sheeny
facings
and
gold
lace
and
i
was
heartily
amused
at
the
modest
confusion
with
which
the
hero
of
many
battles
regarded
the
fine
uniform
scarcely
daring
to
touch
it
and
at
the
quiet
way
in
which
at
last
he
folded
it
up
carefully
and
deposited
it
in
his
portmanteau
saying
to
me
give
stuart
my
best
thanks
major
the
coat
is
much
too
handsome
for
me
but
i
shall
take
the
best
care
of
it
and
shall
prize
it
highly
as
a
souvenir
and
now
let
us
have
some
dinner
but
i
protested
emphatically
against
the
summary
disposition
of
the
matter
of
the
coat
deeming
my
mission
indeed
but
half
executed
and
remarked
that
stuart
would
certainly
ask
how
the
coat
fitted
and
that
i
should
take
it
as
a
personal
favour
if
he
would
put
it
on
to
this
with
a
smile
he
readily
assented
and
having
donned
the
garment
he
escorted
me
outside
the
tent
to
the
table
where
dinner
had
been
served
in
the
open
air
the
whole
of
the
staff
were
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
at
their
chief
brilliant
appearance
and
the
old
negro
servant
who
was
bearing
the
roast
turkey
to
the
board
stopped
in
mid
career
with
a
most
bewildered
expression
and
gazed
in
such
wonderment
at
his
master
as
if
he
had
been
transfigured
before
him
meanwhile
the
rumour
of
the
change
ran
like
electricity
through
the
neighbouring
camps
the
soldiers
came
running
by
hundreds
to
the
spot
desirous
of
seeing
their
beloved
stonewall
in
his
new
attire
and
the
first
wearing
of
a
new
robe
by
louis
xiv
at
whose
morning
toilette
all
the
world
was
accustomed
to
assemble
never
created
half
the
excitement
at
versailles
that
was
roused
in
the
woods
of
virginia
by
the
investment
of
jackson
in
the
new
regulation
uniform
memoirs
of
the
confederate
war
volume
the
second
incident
is
less
amusing
but
was
not
less
appreciated
by
the
rank
and
file
riding
one
morning
near
front
royal
accompanied
by
his
staff
jackson
was
stopped
by
a
countrywoman
with
a
chubby
child
on
either
side
who
inquired
anxiously
for
her
son
johnnie
serving
she
said
in
captain
jackson
company
the
general
with
the
deferential
courtesy
he
never
laid
aside
introduced
himself
as
her
son
commanding
officer
but
begged
for
further
information
as
to
his
regiment
the
good
dame
however
whose
interest
in
the
war
centred
on
one
individual
appeared
astonished
that
captain
jackson
did
not
know
her
particular
johnnie
and
repeated
her
inquiries
with
such
tearful
emphasis
that
the
young
staff
officers
began
to
smile
unfortunately
for
themselves
jackson
heard
a
titter
and
turning
on
them
with
a
scathing
rebuke
for
their
want
of
manners
he
sent
them
off
in
different
directions
to
discover
johnnie
giving
them
no
rest
until
mother
and
son
were
brought
together
but
if
the
soldiers
loved
jackson
for
his
simplicity
and
respected
him
for
his
honesty
beyond
and
above
was
the
sense
of
his
strength
and
power
of
his
indomitable
will
of
the
inflexibility
of
his
justice
and
of
the
unmeasured
resources
of
his
vigorous
intellect
it
is
curious
even
after
the
long
lapse
of
years
to
hear
his
veterans
speak
of
their
commander
laughter
mingles
with
tears
each
has
some
droll
anecdote
to
relate
each
some
instance
of
thoughtful
sympathy
or
kindly
deed
but
it
is
still
plain
to
be
seen
how
they
feared
his
displeasure
how
hard
they
found
his
discipline
how
conscious
they
were
of
their
own
mental
inferiority
the
mighty
phantom
of
their
lost
leader
still
dominates
their
thoughts
just
as
in
the
battles
of
the
confederacy
his
earthly
presentment
dominated
the
will
of
the
second
army
corps
in
the
campaign
which
had
driven
the
invaders
from
virginia
and
carried
the
confederate
colours
to
within
sight
of
washington
his
men
had
found
their
master
they
had
forgotten
how
to
criticise
his
generals
had
learned
to
trust
him
success
and
adulation
had
not
indeed
made
him
more
expansive
he
was
as
reticent
as
ever
and
his
troops
the
as
they
were
now
called
were
still
marched
to
and
fro
without
knowing
why
or
whither
but
men
and
officers
instead
of
grumbling
when
they
were
roused
at
untimely
hours
or
when
their
marches
were
prolonged
without
apparent
necessity
obeyed
with
alacrity
and
amused
themselves
by
wondering
what
new
surprise
the
general
was
preparing
where
are
you
going
they
were
asked
as
they
were
turned
out
for
an
unexpected
march
we
do
know
but
old
jack
does
was
the
laughing
reply
and
they
had
learned
something
of
his
methods
they
had
discovered
the
value
of
time
of
activity
of
mystery
of
resolution
they
discussed
his
stratagems
gradually
evolving
for
they
were
by
no
means
apparent
at
the
time
the
object
and
aim
of
his
manoeuvres
and
the
stirring
verses
sung
round
every
show
that
the
soldiers
not
only
grasped
his
principles
of
warfare
but
that
they
knew
right
well
to
whom
their
victories
were
to
be
attributed

fredericksburg
october
while
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
resting
in
the
valley
mcclellan
was
preparing
for
a
winter
campaign
he
was
unable
however
to
keep
pace
with
the
impatience
of
the
northern
people
not
only
was
he
determined
to
postpone
all
movement
until
his
army
was
properly
equipped
his
ranks
recruited
his
cavalry
remounted
and
his
administrative
services
reorganised
but
the
military
authorities
at
washington
were
very
slow
in
meeting
his
demands
notwithstanding
then
the
orders
of
the
president
the
remonstrances
of
halleck
and
the
clamour
of
the
press
for
more
than
five
weeks
after
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
he
remained
inactive
on
the
potomac
it
may
be
that
in
the
interests
of
the
army
he
was
perfectly
right
in
resisting
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
him
he
was
certainly
the
best
judge
of
the
temper
of
his
troops
and
could
estimate
more
exactly
than
either
lincoln
or
halleck
the
chances
of
success
if
he
were
to
encounter
lee
veterans
on
their
native
soil
however
this
may
be
his
inaction
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
demands
of
the
political
situation
the
president
immediately
the
confederates
retired
from
maryland
had
taken
a
step
which
changed
the
character
of
the
war
hitherto
the
northerners
had
fought
for
the
restoration
of
the
union
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
as
interpreted
by
themselves
now
after
eighteen
months
of
conflict
the
constitution
was
deliberately
violated
for
the
clause
which
forbade
all
interference
with
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
several
states
a
declaration
that
slavery
should
no
longer
exist
within
the
boundaries
of
the
republic
was
substituted
and
the
armies
of
the
union
were
called
upon
to
fight
for
the
freedom
of
the
negro
in
the
condition
of
political
parties
this
measure
was
daring
it
was
not
approved
by
the
democrats
and
many
of
the
soldiers
were
democrats
or
by
those
and
they
were
not
a
few
who
believed
that
compromise
was
the
surest
means
of
restoring
peace
or
by
those
and
they
were
numerous
who
thought
the
dissolution
of
the
union
a
smaller
evil
than
the
continuance
of
the
war
the
opposition
was
very
strong
and
there
was
but
one
means
of
reconciling
it
vigorous
action
on
the
part
of
the
army
the
immediate
invasion
of
virginia
and
a
decisive
victory
delay
would
expose
the
framers
of
the
measure
to
the
imputation
of
having
promised
more
than
they
could
perform
of
wantonly
tampering
with
the
constitution
and
of
widening
the
breach
between
north
and
south
beyond
all
hope
of
healing
in
consequence
therefore
of
mcclellan
refusal
to
move
forward
the
friction
between
the
federal
government
and
their
which
so
long
as
lee
remained
in
maryland
had
been
allayed
once
more
asserted
its
baneful
influence
and
the
aggressive
attitude
of
the
confederates
did
not
serve
to
make
matters
smoother
although
the
greater
part
of
october
was
for
the
army
of
northern
virginia
a
period
of
unusual
leisure
the
troops
were
not
altogether
idle
as
soon
as
the
stragglers
had
been
brought
in
and
the
ranks
of
the
divisions
once
more
presented
a
respectable
appearance
various
enterprises
were
undertaken
the
second
army
corps
was
entrusted
with
the
destruction
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
a
duty
carried
out
by
jackson
with
characteristic
thoroughness
the
line
from
harper
ferry
to
winchester
as
well
as
that
from
manassas
junction
to
strasburg
were
also
torn
up
and
the
spoils
of
the
late
campaign
were
sent
south
to
richmond
and
staunton
these
preparations
for
defensive
warfare
were
not
however
so
immediately
embarrassing

the
enemy

a

information
came
to

federal

were
near

about

an

of

moving

was

were
dismounted
a
gun
was
brought
into
action
and
under

posted
on

the
main
body
made
a
dash
for
ford
the
point
of
passage
although
guarded
by
about
federal
riflemen
was
quickly
seized
and
stuart
whole

together
with

had
completed

the

advancing

large
force
from

this
brilliantly
conducted
expedition
was
as
fruitful
of
results
as
the
ride
round
mcclellan
army
in
the
previous
june
the
information
obtained
was
most
important
lee
besides
being
furnished
with
a
sufficiently
full
report
of
the
federal
dispositions
learned
that
no
part
of
mcclellan
army
had
been
detached
to
washington
but
that
it
was
being
reinforced
from
that
quarter
and
that
therefore
no
expedition
against
richmond
was
to
be
apprehended
several
hundred
fine
horses
from
the
farms
of
pennsylvania
furnished
excellent
remounts
for
the
confederate
troopers
prominent
officials
were
brought
in
as
hostages
for
the
safety
of
the
virginia
citizens
who
had
been
thrown
into
northern
prisons
only
a
few
scouts
were
captured
by
the
enemy
and
not
a
man
was
killed
the
distance
marched
by
stuart
from
darkesville
to
white
ford
was
one
hundred
and
miles
of
which
the
last
eighty
were
covered
without
a
halt
crossing

at
mccoy
ford
about
on

he
had
recrossed
it
at
white
ford
between
and
on
october
he
was
thus
for
hours
inside
the
enemy
lines
and
during
the
greater
part
of
his
march
within
thirty
miles
of
mcclellan
headquarters
near
harper
ferry
it
is
often
the
case
in
war
that
a
and
boldly
executed
enterprise
has
a
far
greater
effect
than
could
possibly
have
been
anticipated
neither
lee
nor
stuart
looked
for
larger
results
from
this
raid
than
a
certain
amount
of
plunder
and
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
but
skill
and
daring
were
crowned
with
a
more
ample
reward
than
the
attainment
of
the
immediate
object
in
the
first
place
the
expedition
although
there
was
little
fighting
was
most
destructive
to
the
federal
cavalry
mcclellan
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
arrest
the
raiders
directly
the
news
came
in
that
they
had
crossed
the
potomac
troops
were
sent
in
every
direction
to
cut
off
their
retreat
yet
so
eminently
judicious
were
stuart
precautions
so
intelligent
the
maryland
soldiers
who
acted
as
his
guides
and
so
rapid
his
movements
that
although
constant
reports
were
received
by
the
federal
generals
as
to
the
progress
and
direction
of
his
column
the
information
came
always
too
late
to
serve
any
practical
purpose
and
his
pursuers
were
never
in
time
to
bar
his
march
general
pleasanton
with
such
cavalry
as
could
be
spared
from
the
picket
line
marched
miles
in
hours
and
general
averell
brigade
quartered
on
the
upper
potomac
two
hundred
miles
in
four
days
the
severity
of
the
marches
told
heavily
on
these
commands
already
worn
out
by
hard
work
on
the
outposts
and
so
many
of
the
horses
broke
down
that
a
period
of
repose
was
absolutely
necessary
to
refit
them
for
the
field
until
his
cavalry
should
have
recovered
it
was
impossible
for
mcclellan
to
invade
virginia
in
the
second
place
neither
the
northern
government
nor
the
northern
people
could
forget
that
this
was
the
second
time
that
mcclellan
had
allowed
stuart
to
ride
at
will
round
the
army
of
the
potomac
public
confidence
in
the
was
greatly
shaken
and
a
handle
was
given
to
his
opponents
in
the
ranks
of
the
abolitionists
who
because
he
was
a
democrat
and
had
much
influence
with
the
army
were
already
clamouring
for
his
removal
october
the
respite
which
stuart
had
gained
for
virginia
was
not
however
of
long
duration
on
october
mcclellan
having
ascertained
by
means
of
a
strong
reconnaissance

that

along

was
a
second
hostile

not
indeed
so
large
as
that
commanded
by

in

of
this
enormous
host
and
with
richmond
only
weakly
garrisoned
behind

lee
had
actually
separated
his
two
wings
by
an
interval
of
sixty
miles
he
was
evidently
playing
his
old
game
dividing
his
army
with
a
view
to
a
junction
on
the
field
of
battle
lincoln
in
a
letter
of
advice
with
which
he
had
favoured
mcclellan
a
few
days
previously
had
urged
the
importance
of
making
lee
line
of
supply
the
first
objective
of
the
invading
army
an
advance
east
of
the
blue
ridge
he
said
would
at
once
menace
the
enemy
line
of
communications
and
compel
him
to
keep
his
forces
together
and
if
lee
disregarding
this
menace
were
to
cut
in
between
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
washington
mcclellan
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
attack
him
in
rear
he
suggested
moreover
that
by
hard
marching
it
might
be
possible
for
mcclellan
to
reach
richmond
first
the
confederate
line
of
communications
so
the
president
believed
ran
from
richmond
to
culpeper
court
house
and
mcclellan
advanced
guards
on
november
were
within
twenty
miles
of
that
point
lee
however
had
altogether
failed
to
respond
to
strategical
pronouncements
instead
of
concentrating
his
forces
he
had
dispersed
them
and
instead
of
fearing
for
his
own
communications
he
had
placed
jackson
in
a
position
to
interfere
very
seriously
with
those
of
his
enemy
lincoln
letter
to
mcclellan
shows
that
the
lessons
of
the
war
had
not
been
altogether
lost
upon
him
generals
banks
and
pope
with
some
stimulus
from
stonewall
jackson
had
taught
him
what
an
important
part
is
played
by
lines
of
supply
he
had
mastered
the
strategical
truism
that
an
enemy
communications
are
his
weakest
point
but
there
were
other
considerations
which
had
not
come
home
to
him
he
had
overlooked
the
possibility
that
lee
might
threaten
mcclellan
communications
before
mcclellan
could
threaten
his
and
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
an
army
operating
in
its
own
country
if
proper
forethought
be
exercised
can
establish
an
alternative
line
of
supply
and
provide
itself
with
a
double
base
thus
gaining
a
freedom
of
action
of
which
an
invader
bound
unless
he
has
command
of
the
sea
to
a
single
line
is
generally
deprived
the
president
appears
to
have
thought
that
if
lee
were
cut
off
from
richmond
the
army
of
northern
virginia
would
be
reduced
to
starvation
and
become
absolutely
powerless
it
never
entered
his
head
that
the
astute
commander
of
that
army
had
already
in
anticipation
of
the
very
movement
which
mcclellan
was
now
making
established
a
second
base
at
staunton
and
that
his
line
of
supply
in
case
of
necessity
would
not
run
over
the
open
country
between
richmond
and
gordonsville
but
from
staunton
to
culpeper
behind
the
ramparts
of
the
blue
ridge
lee
in
fact
accepted
with
equanimity
the
possibility
of
the
federals
intervening
between
himself
and
richmond
he
had
already
in
the
campaign
against
pope
extricated
himself
from
such
a
situation
by
a
bold
stroke
against
his
enemy
communications
and
the
natural
fastness
of
the
valley
amply
provided
with
food
and
forage
afforded
facilities
for
such
a
manoeuvre
which
had
been
altogether
absent
before
the
second
manassas
nor
was
he
of
lincoln
opinion
that
if
the
army
of
northern
virginia
cut
in
between
washington
and
mcclellan
it
would
be
a
simple
operation
for
the
latter
to
about
face
and
attack
the
confederates
in
rear
he
knew
and
lincoln
if
he
had
studied
pope
campaign
should
have
known
it
too
that
the
operation
of
countermarching
if
the
line
of
communication
has
been
cut
is
not
only
apt
to
produce
great
confusion
and
great
suffering
but
has
the
very
worst
effect
on
the
morale
of
the
troops
but
lee
had
that
practical
experience
which
lincoln
lacked
and
without
which
it
is
but
waste
of
words
to
dogmatise
on
strategy
he
was
well
aware
that
a
large
army
is
a
cumbrous
machine
not
readily
deflected
from
the
original
direction
of
the
line
of
march
on
november
the
army
of

including

therefore
so
long
as
he
had
to
depend
for
his
supplies
on
a
single
line
of
railway
was
not
quite
so
simple
as
lincoln
imagined
nevertheless
on
november
lee
decided
to
unite
his
army
as
soon
as
the
enemy
advanced
from
warrenton
jackson
was
to
ascend
the
valley
and
crossing
the
blue
ridge
at
fisher
gap
join
hands
with
longstreet
who
would
retire
from
madison
court
house
to
the
vicinity
of
gordonsville
the
confederates
would
then
be
concentrated
on
mcclellan
right
flank
should
he
march
on
richmond
ready
to
take
advantage
of
any
opportunity
for
attack
or
if
attack
were
considered
too
hazardous
to
threaten
his
communications
and
compel
him
to
fall
back
to
the
potomac
the
proposed
concentration
however
was
not
immediately
carried
out
in
the
first
place
the
federal
advance
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
in
the
second
place
jackson
was
unwilling
to
abandon
his
post
of
vantage
behind
the
blue
ridge
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
policy
of
manoeuvring
instead
of
intrenching
of
aiming
at
the
enemy
flank
and
rear
instead
of
barring
his
advance
directly
was
in
full
agreement
with
his
views
of
war
and
it
appears
that
about
this
date
he
had
submitted
proposals
for
a
movement
against
the
federal
communications
it
would
be
interesting
indeed
to
have
the
details
of
his
design
but
jackson
for
this
period
has
unfortunately
disappeared
nor
did
he
communicate
his
ideas
to
any
of
his
staff
letters
from
general
lee
however
indicate
that
the
manoeuvre
proposed
was
of
the
same
character
as
that
which
brought
pope
in
such
hot
haste
from
the
rappahannock
to
bull
run
and
that
it
was
jackson
suggestion
which
caused
the
to
reconsider
his
determination
of
uniting
his
army
as
long
as
general
jackson
wrote
lee
to
the
secretary
of
war
on
november
can
operate
with
safety
and
secure
his
retirement
west
of
the
massanutton
mountains
i
think
it
advantageous
that
he
should
be
in
a
position
to
threaten
the
enemy
flank
and
rear
and
thus
prevent
his
advance
southward
on
the
east
side
of
the
blue
ridge
general
jackson
has
been
directed
accordingly
and
should
the
enemy
descend
into
the
valley
general
longstreet
will
attack
his
rear
and
cut
off
his
communications
the
enemy
apparently
is
so
strong
in
numbers
that
i
think
it
preferable
to
baffle
his
designs
by
manoeuvring
rather
than
resist
his
advance
by
main
force
to
accomplish
the
latter
without
too
great

require

seems
to
be
massing

gives
him
great
facilities

has
occurred

me
that
his
object
may
be
to
seize
upon

to
intercept

would

will
serve

purpose
as
well
as

effected

way
with

understanding
you
can
use
your
discretion

can
rely

jackson
plan

mcclellan

at
warrenton
his
troops
had
never
been
in
better
condition
they
were
in
good
spirits
well
supplied

admirably
equipped
owing
to
the
activity

fact
that
the
confederate
horses
were
at
this
time
attacked
by
a
disease
which
affected
both

his
information
was
more
accurate
than

he
knew
that
longstreet
was
at

saw
the

of
either
defeating

forcing
him
to

army
was
concentrating
for
an
advance
against
longstreet
mcclellan
was
ordered
to
hand
over
his
command
to
general
burnside
lincoln
had
yielded
to
the
insistence
of
mcclellan
political
opponents
to
the
rancour
of
stanton
and
the
jealousy
of
halleck
but
in
sacrificing
the
general
who
had
saved
the
union
at
sharpsburg
he
sacrificed
the
lives
of
many
thousands
of
his
soldiers
a
darker
day
than
even
the
second
manassas
was
in
store
for
the
army
of
the
potomac
mcclellan
was
not
a
general
of
the
first
order
but
he
was
the
only
officer
in
the
united
states
who
had
experience
of
handling
large
masses
of
troops
and
he
was
improving
every
day
stuart
had
taught
him
the
use
of
cavalry
and
lee
the
value
of
the
initiative
he
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
resolution
as
his
march
with
an
army
of
recently
defeated
men
against
lee
in
maryland
conclusively
proves
and
although
he
had
never
won
a
decisive
victory
he
possessed
to
a
degree
which
was
never
attained
by
any
of
his
successors
the
confidence
and
affection
of
his
troops
but
deplorable
as
was
the
weakness
which
sanctioned
his
removal
on
the
eve
of
a
decisive
manoeuvre
the
blunder
which
put
burnside
in
his
place
was
even
more
so
the
latter
appears
to
have
been
the
protégé
of
a
small
political
faction
he
had
many
good
qualities
he
was
a
firm
friend
modest
generous
and
energetic
but
he
was
so
far
from
being
distinguished
for
military
ability
that
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
it
was
very
strongly
questioned
whether
he
was
fit
to
command
an
army
corps
his
conduct
at
sharpsburg
where
he
had
been
entrusted
with
the
attack
on
the
confederate
right
had
been
the
subject
of
the
severest
criticism
and
by
not
a
few
of
his
colleagues
he
was
considered
directly
responsible
for
the
want
of
combination
which
had
marred
mcclellan
plan
of
attack
more
than
once
lincoln
infringed
his
own
famous
aphorism
never
swap
horses
when
crossing
a
stream
but
when
he
transferred
the
destinies
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
from
mcclellan
to
burnside
he
did
more
he
selected
the
weakest
of
his
team
of
generals
to
bear
the
burden
at
the
same
time
that
mcclellan
was
superseded
general
fitzjohn
porter
the
gallant
soldier
of
gaines
mill
and
malvern
hill
probably
the
best
officer
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
ordered
to
resign
command
of
the
fifth
army
corps
and
to
appear
before
a
on
charges
of
incompetency
and
neglect
of
duty
at
the
second
manassas
the
fact
that
those
charges
were
preferred
by
pope
and
that
porter
had
been
allowed
to
retain
his
command
through
the
campaign
in
maryland
were
hardly
calculated
to
inspire
the
army
with
confidence
in
either
the
wisdom
or
the
justice
of
its
rulers
and
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
his
intimate
friendship
with
mcclellan
had
more
to
say
to
his
trial
than
his
alleged
incompetency
burnside
commenced
his
career
by
renouncing
the
enterprise
which
mcclellan
had
contemplated
longstreet
was
left
unmolested
at
culpeper
and
in
order
to
free
the
communications
from
jackson
the
federal
army
was
marched
eastward
along
the
rappahannock
to
falmouth
a
new
line
of
supply
being
established
between
that
village
and
aquia
creek
the
port
on
the
potomac
six
hours
sail
from
washington
lee
had
already
foreseen
that
jackson
presence
in
the
valley
might
induce
the
federals
to
change
their
line
of
operations
fredericksburg
on
the
south
side
of
the
rappahannock
and
the
terminus
of
the
richmond
and
potomac
railroad
had
consequently
been
garrisoned
by
an
infantry
regiment
and
a
battery
while
three
regiments
of
cavalry
patrolled
the
river
this
force
however
was
not
posted
on
the
rappahannock
with
a
view
of
retarding
the
advance
but
merely
for
observation
lee
at
this
date
had
no
intention
of
concentrating
at
fredericksburg
the
federals
if
they
acted
with
resolution
could
readily
forestall
him
and
the
line
of
the

a
small
but
difficult

peculiar
advantages
to

november
the
federal

was
rapid
on
november
the
army
of
the
potomac
left
warrenton
and
the
advanced
guard
reached
falmouth
on
the
afternoon
of
the
general
sumner
in
command
observing
the
weakness
of
the
confederate
garrison
requested
permission
from
burnside
to
cross
the
rappahannock
and
establish
himself
on
the
further
bank

were
at

and

were

closing

was
unwilling
to
expose
part
of
his
forces
on
the
right
bank
with
no
means
of
retreat
except
a
difficult
and
uncertain
ford
the
same
day
part
of
longstreet
corps
and
a
brigade
of
cavalry
were
sent
to
fredericksburg
and
on
the
lee
finding
that
the
federals
had
left
warrenton
ordered
longstreet
to
concentrate
his
whole
force
at
fredericksburg
and
summoned
jackson
from
the
valley
to
orange
court
house
jackson
meanwhile
had
moved
to
winchester
probably
with
the
design
of
threatening
the
enemy
garrisons
on
the
potomac
and
this
unexpected
movement
had
caused
much
perturbation
in

presidents
demanded
further
protection
for
their

generals
begged
for
reinforcements
and
according
to
the
times
correspondent
it
was
the
universal
belief
that
stonewall
jackson
was
ready
to
pounce
upon
washington
from
the
shenandoah
and
to
capture
president
secretaries
and
all
but
before
apprehension
increased
to
panic
before
lincoln
had
become
infected
by
the
prevailing
uneasiness
the
departure
of
the
confederates
from
the
valley
brought
relief
to
the
affrighted
citizens
on
november
jackson
bade
farewell
to
winchester
his
headquarters
were
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
graham
manse
and
he
spent
his
last
evening
with
his
old
friends
he
was
in
fine
health
and
fine
spirits
wrote
the
minister
wife
to
jackson
the
children
begged
to
be
permitted
to
sit
up
to
see
general
jackson
and
he
really
seemed
overjoyed
to
see
them
played
with
them
and
fondled
them
and
they
were
equally
pleased
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
a
great
recreation
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
living
over
last
winter
again
and
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
hope
of
getting
back
to
spend
this
winter
with
us
in
the
old
room
which
i
told
him
i
was
keeping
for
you
and
him
he
certainly
has
had
adulation
enough
to
spoil
him
but
it
seems
not
to
affect
or
harm
him
at
all
he
is
the
same
humble
dependent
christian
desiring
to
give
god
all
the
glory
looking
to
him
alone
for
a
blessing
and
not
thinking
of
himself
so
it
was
with
no
presage
that
this
was
the
last
time
he
would
look
upon
the
scenes
he
loved
that
jackson
moved
southward
by
the
valley
turnpike
past
kernstown
his
columns
swept
past
middletown
and
strasburg
and
all
the
fields
of
former
triumphs
until
the
peaks
of
the
massanuttons
threw
their
shadows
across
the
highway
and
the
mighty
bulk
of
the
noble
mountains
draped
in
the
gold
and
crimson
of
the
autumn
once
more
to
the
tramp
of
his
veterans
turning
east
at
new
market
he
struck
upwards
by
the
familiar
road
and
then
descending
the
narrow
pass
he
forded
the
shenandoah
and
crossing
the
luray
valley
vanished
in
the
forests
of
the
blue
ridge
through
the
dark
pines
of
fisher
gap
he
led
his
soldiers
down
to
the
virginia
plains
and
the
rivers
and
the
mountains
knew
him
no
more
until
their
dead
returned
to
them
on
the
the
second

at

the
next

it
was
concentrated
at
orange
court
house
miles
from
fredericksburg
in
eight
days
two
being
given
to
rest
the
troops
had
marched
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
and
with
scarce
a
straggler
for
the
stern
measures
which
had
been
taken
to
put
discipline
on
a
firmer
basis
and
to
make
the
regimental
officers
do
their
duty
had
already
produced
a
salutary
effect
on
jackson
arrival
at
orange
court
house
he
found
the
situation
unchanged
burnside
notwithstanding
that
heavy
and
sharp
frosts
betokened
the
approach
of
winter
the
season
of
impassable
roads
and
swollen
rivers
was
still
encamped
near
falmouth
the
difficulty
of
establishing
a
new
base
of
supplies
at
aquia
creek
and
some
delay
on
the
part
of
the
washington
authorities
in
furnishing
him
with
a
pontoon
train
had
kept
him
idle
but
he
had
not
relinquished
his
design
of
marching
upon
richmond
his
quiescence
however
together
with
the
wishes
of
the
president
had
induced
general
lee
to
change
his
plans
the
army
of
northern
virginia
strong
although
in
order
to
induce
the
federals
to
attack
it
was
not
yet
closely
concentrated
was
ready
to
oppose
in
full
force
the
passage
of
the
rappahannock
and
all
thought
of
retiring
to
the
north
anna
had
been
abandoned
november
on

therefore
jackson
was
ordered
forward
and
while
the
first
army
corps
occupied
a
strong
position
in
rear
of
fredericksburg
with
an
advanced
detachment
in
the
town
the

was
told
off
to
protect

lower
reaches
of
the
rappahannock
ewell
division
still
commanded
by

posted
at
neck
twelve
miles
of
fredericksburg
a
spot
which
afforded
many
facilities
for

from

stuart
whose
division
was
now
increased
to
four
brigades
watched
both
front
and
flanks
the
rappahannock
was
undoubtedly
a
formidable
obstacle
navigable
for
small
vessels
as
far
as
fredericksburg
the

of

it
is
two
hundred
yards
wide
in
the
neighbourhood
of

and
it
increases
in
width
and
depth
as
it
flows
seaward
but
above

there
are
several
easy
fords
the
river

clad
with

hiding
the
movements
of
troops
and
from
falmouth
downward
the
left
bank
under
the
name
of
the
stafford
heights
so
completely
commands
the
right
that
it
was
manifestly
impossible
for
the
confederates
to
prevent
the
enemy
furnished
with
a
far
superior
artillery
from
making
good
the
passage
of
the
stream
a
mile
west
of
fredericksburg
however
extending
from
beck
island
to
the
heights
beyond
the
massaponax
creek
runs
a
long
low
ridge
broken
by
ravines
and
partially
covered
with
timber
which
with
some
slight
aid
from
axe
and
spade
could
be
rendered
an
exceedingly
strong
position
longstreet
who
occupied
this
ridge
had
been
ordered
to
intrench
himself
had
been
dug
on
the
bare
crest
named
marye

which
immediately
faces
fredericksburg
a
few
had
been
thrown
up
natural
defences
improved
and
some
slight
breastworks
and
abattis
constructed
along
the
outskirts
of
the
woods
these
works
were
at
extreme
range
from
the
stafford
heights
and
the
field
of
fire
extending
as
far
as
the
river
a
distance
varying
from
fifteen
hundred
to
three
thousand
yards
needed
no
clearing
over
such
ground
a
frontal
attack
even
if
made
by
superior
numbers
had
little
chance
of
success
but
notwithstanding
its
manifest
advantages
the
position
found
no
favour
in
the
eyes
of
jackson
it
could
be
easily
turned
by
the
fords
above
falmouth
banks
united
states
ely
and
germanna
this
however
was
a
minor
disqualification
compared
with
the
restrictions
in
the
way
of
offensive
action
if
the
enemy
should
cross
at
fredericksburg
both
his
flanks
would
be
protected
by
the
river
while
his
numerous
batteries
arrayed
on
the
stafford
heights
and
commanding
the
length
and
the
breadth
of
the

make
counterstroke
difficult
and
pursuit
impossible
to
await
attack
moreover
was
to
allow
the
enemy
to
choose
his
own
time
and
place
and
to
surrender
the
advantages
of
the
initiative
communications
were
protected
by
the
rappahannock
and
it
was
thus
impracticable
to
manoeuvre
against
his
most
vulnerable
point
to
inflict
on
him
a
surprise
to
compel
him
to
change
front
and
in
case
he
were
defeated
to
cut
him
off
from
his
base
and
deprive
him
of
his
supplies
the
line
of
the
north
anna
in
jackson
opinion
promised
far
greater
results
the
federals
advancing
from
fredericksburg
would
expose
their
right
flank
and
their
communications
for
a
distance
of
miles
and
if
they
were
compelled
to
retreat
the
destruction
of
their
whole
army
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility

am
opposed

of
hazel
run
the
confederate
outposts
had
been
driven
in
and
three
more
bridges
had
been
thrown
across
thus
on
the
night
of
the
the
federals
who
were
now
organised
in
three
grand
divisions
each
of
two
army
corps
had
established
their
advanced
guards
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rappahannock
and
under
cover
of
the
batteries
on
the
stafford
heights
could
rapidly
and
safely
pass
over
their
great
host
of
men
the
three
grand
divisions
were
commanded
by
sumner
hooker
and
franklin
burnside
had
framed
his
plan
of
attack
on
the
assumption
that
army
was
dispersed
along
the
rappahannock
his
balloon
had
reported
large
confederate
bivouacs
below
skinker
neck
and
he
appears
to
have
believed
that
lee
alarmed
by
his
demonstrations
near
port
royal
had
posted
half
his
army
in
that
neighbourhood
utterly
unsuspicious
that
a
trap
had
been
laid
for
him
he
had
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
this
apparently
vicious
distribution
and
crossing
rapidly
at
fredericksburg
to
defeat
the
confederate
left
before
the
right
could
lend
support
port
royal
is
but
eighteen
miles
from
fredericksburg
and
in
prompt
action
therefore
lay
his
only
hope
of
success
burnside
however
after
the
successful
establishment
of
his
six
bridges
evinced
the
same
want
of
resolution
which
had
won
him
so
unenviable
a
reputation
at
sharpsburg
the
long
hours
of
darkness
slipped
peacefully
away
no
unusual
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
and
all
was
still
along
the
rappahannock
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
december
that
the
army
began
to
cross
and
the
movement
made
difficult
by
a
dense
fog
was
by
no
means
energetic
four
of
the
six
army
corps
were
transferred
during
the
day
to
the
southern
bank
but
beyond
a
cavalry
reconnaissance
which
was
checked
by
stuart
there
was
no
fighting
and
to
every
man
in
the
federal
ranks
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
the
delay
was
fatal
lee
meanwhile
with
ample
time
at
his
disposal
and
full
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
his
dispositions
calmly
awaited
the
development
of
his
adversary
plans
jackson
brought
up
hill
and
taliaferro
at
noon
and
posted
them
on
longstreet
right
but
it
was
not
till
that
hour
when
it
had
at
last
become
certain
that
the
whole
federal
army
was
crossing
that
couriers
were
dispatched
to
call

forward
from

the
rumbling
of

on

the

the
sound
of

music
came
muffled
by
the

to
the
ears
of
the
confederates
lying
expectant
on

and

it
is
necessary
to
notice
particularly
the
shape
size
and
position
of
the
projecting
tongue
of
woodland
which
broke
the
continuity
of

line
a
german
officer
on

staff
had
the
day
previous
while
riding
along
the
position
remarked
its
existence
and
suggested
the
propriety
of
razing
it
but
although
jackson
himself
predicted
that
there
would
be
the
scene
of
the
severest
fighting
the
ground
was
so
marshy
within
its
depths
and
the
undergrowth
so
dense
and
tangled
that
it
was
judged
impenetrable
and
left
unoccupied
an
error
of
judgment
which
cost
many
lives
general

had
also
recognised
the
danger
of

between

reported

without

to

map
the
field
of
fredericksburg
the
coppice
was
triangular
in
shape
and
extended
nearly
six
hundred
yards
beyond
the
embankment
the
base
which
faced
the
federals
was
five
hundred
yards
long
beyond
the
apex
the
ground
was
swampy
and
covered
with
scrub
and
the
ridge
depressed
at
this
point
to
a
level
with
the
plain
afforded
no
position
from
which
artillery
could
command
the
approach
to
or
issue
from
this
patch
of

a
space
of
seven

nearly
of

the

taliaferro

were
in

line
and
reserve
of
his
one
hundred
and
guns
only
were
in
position
but
the
wooded
and
broken
character
of
the
ground
forbade
a
further
deployment
of
his
favourite
arm
his
left
near
deep
run
was
in
close
touch
with
hood
division
of
longstreet

and
in

of

protected
by

was
stuart
with

brigades
and
his
one
whitworth
gun
a
piece
of
great
range
and
large
calibre
was
posted
on
the
wooded
heights
beyond
the
massaponax
of
yerby
house
jackson
dispositions
were
almost
identical
with
those
which
he
had
adopted
at
the
second
manassas
his
whole
force
was
hidden
in
the
woods
every
gun
that
could
find
room
was
ready
for
action
and
the
batteries
were
deployed
in
two
masses
instead
however
of
giving
each
division
a
definite
section
of
the
line
he
had
handed
over
the
whole
front
to
hill
this
arrangement
however
had
been
made
before
hill
and
early
came
up
and
with
the
battle
imminent
a
change
was
hazardous
in
many
respects
moreover
the
ground
he
now
occupied
resembled
that
which
he
had
so
successfully
defended
on
august
and
there
was
the
wood
opposite
the
centre
affording
the
enemy
a
covered
line
of
approach
the
open
fields
pasture
and
stubble
on
either
hand
the
stream
hidden
by
timber
and
difficult
of
passage
on
the
one
flank
and
longstreet
on
the
other
but
the
position
at
fredericksburg
was
less
strong
for
defence
than
that
at
the
second
manassas
for
not
only
was
jackson
line
within
three
thousand
yards
a
long
range
but
not
ineffective
of
the
heavy
guns
on
the
stafford
heights
but
on
the
bare
plain
between
the
railway
and
the
river
there
was
ample
room
for
the
deployment
of
the
federal
at
the
second
manassas
on
the
other
hand
the
advantages
of
the
artillery
position
had
been
on
the
side
of
the
confederates
nevertheless
with
the
soldiers
of
sharpsburg
ragged
indeed
and
but
eager
for
battle
and
strong
in
numbers
there
was
no
reason
to
dread
the
powerful
artillery
of
the
foe
and
confidence
was
never
higher
than
when
accompanied
by
his
staff
he
rode
along
his
line
of
battle
he
was
not
however
received
by
his
soldiers
with
their
usual
demonstrations
of
enthusiastic
devotion
in
honour
of
the
day
he
had
put
on
the
uniform
with
which
stuart
had
presented
him
the
old
cadet
cap
which
had
so
often
waved
his
men
to
victory
was
replaced
by
a
resplendent
with
gold
lace
little
sorrel
had
been
deposed
in
favour
of
a
more
imposing
charger
and
the
veterans
failed
to
recognise
their
commander
until
he
had
galloped
past
them
a
confederate
has
given
a
graphic
picture
of
his
appearance
when
the
fight
was
at
its
hottest
a
general
officer
mounted
upon
a
superb
bay
horse
and
followed
by
a
single
courier
rode
up
through
our
guns
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
he
rode
straight
to
the
front
halted
and
seemed
gazing
intently
on
the
enemy
line
of
battle
the
outfit
before
me
from
top
to
toe
cap
coat
horse
and
furniture
were
all
of
the
new
order
of
things
but
there
was
something
about
the
man
that
did
not
look
so
new
after
all
he
appeared
to
be
an
friend
of
all
the
turmoil
around
him
as
he
had
done
us
the
honour
to
make
an
afternoon
call
on
the
artillery
i
thought
it
becoming
in
someone
to
say
something
on
the
occasion
no
one
did
however
so
although
a
somewhat
bashful
and
youngster
i
plucked
up
courage
enough
to
venture
to
remark
that
those
big
guns
over
the
river
had
been
knocking
us
about
pretty
considerably
during
the
day
he
quickly
turned
his
head
and
i
knew
in
an
instant
who
it
was
before
me
the
chiselled
features
the
thin
compressed
and
determined
lips
the
calm
steadfast
eye
the
countenance
to
command
respect
and
in
time
of
war
to
give
the
soldier
that
confidence
he
so
much
craves
from
a
superior
officer
were
all
there
he
turned
his
head
quickly
and
looking
me
all
over
rode
up
the
line
and
away
as
quickly
and
silently
as
he
came
his
little
courier
hard
upon
his
heels
and
this
was
my
first
sight
of
stonewall
jackson
from
his
own
lines
jackson
passed
along
the
front
drawing
the
fire
of
the
federal
skirmishers
who
were
creeping
forward
and
proceeded
to
the
centre
of
the
position
where
on
the
eminence
which
has
since
borne
the
name
of
lee
hill
the
surrounded
by
his
generals
was
giving
his
last
instructions
it
was
past
nine
the
sun
shining
out
with
almost
september
warmth
was
drawing
up
the
mist
which
hid
the
opposing
armies
and
as
the
dense
white
folds
dissolved
and
rolled
sway
the
confederates
saw
the
broad
plain
beneath
them
dark
with
more
than
foes
of
these
the
left
wing
commanded
by
franklin
and
composed
of
men
and
guns
were
moving
against
the
second
corps
under
sumner
were
forming
for
attack
on
longstreet
and
from
the
heights
of
stafford
where
the
reserves
were
posted
in
dense
masses
a
great
storm
of
shot
and
shell
burst
upon
the
confederate
lines
for
once
says
dabney
war
unmasked
its
terrible
proportions
with
a
distinctness
hitherto
unknown
in
the
landscapes
of
america
and
the
plain
of
fredericksburg
presented
a
panorama
that
was
dreadful
in
its
grandeur
it
was
then
that
longstreet
to
whose
sturdy
heart
the
approach
of
battle
seemed
always
welcome
said
to
jackson
general
do
not
all
those
multitudes
of
federals
frighten
you
we
shall
very
soon
see
whether
i
shall
not
frighten
them
and
with
this
grim
reply
the
commander
of
the
second
corps
rode
back
to
meet
franklin
onset
the
federals
were
already
advancing
from
deep
run
southward
for
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
three
great
lines
of
battle
accompanied
by
numerous
batteries
moved
steadily
forward
powerful
enough
to
all
appearance
to
bear
down
all
opposition
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
on
they
came
says
an
in
beautiful
order
as
if
on
parade
their
bayonets
glistening
in
the
bright
sunlight
on
they
came
waving
their
hundreds
of
regimental
flags
which
relieved
with
warm
bits
of
colouring
the
dull
blue
of
the
columns
and
the
russet
tinge
of
the
wintry
landscape
while
their
artillery
beyond
the
river
continued
the
cannonade
with
unabated
fury
over
their
heads
and
gave
a
background
of
white
fleecy
smoke
like
midsummer
clouds
to
the
animated
picture
and
yet
that
vast
array
so
formidable
of
aspect
lacked
that
moral
force
without
which
physical
power
even
in
its
most
terrible
form
is
but
an
idle
show
not
only
were
the
strength
of
the
confederate
position
the
want
of
energy
in
the
preliminary
movements
the
insecurity
of
their
own
situation
but
too
apparent
to
the
intelligence
of
the
regimental
officers
and
men
but
they
mistrusted
their
commander
northern
writers
have
recorded
that
the
army
of
the
potomac
never
went
down
to
battle
with
less
alacrity
than
on
this
day
at
fredericksburg
nor
was
the
order
of
attack
of
such
a
character
as
to
revive
the
confidence
of
the
troops
burnside
deluded
by
the
skill
with
which
jackson
had
hidden
his
troops
into
the
belief
that
the
second
army
corps
was
still
at
port
royal
had
instructed
franklin
to
seize
the
ridge
with
a
single
division
and
meade
pennsylvanians
were
sent
forward
alone
while
the
remainder
of
the
grand
division
over
strong
stood
halted
on
the
plain
awaiting
the
result
of
this
hopeless
manoeuvre
franklin

of

reinforced

meade
advanced
in
three
lines
each
of
a
brigade
with
skirmishers
in

and
on
the
flank
and
his
progress
was
soon
checked
no
sooner
had
his
first
line
crossed
the
richmond
road
than
the
left
was
assailed
by
a
and
raking
artillery
fire
captain
pelham
commanding
stuart
had
galloped
forward
by
jackson
orders
with
his
two
rifled
guns
and
escorted
by
a
dismounted
squadron
had
come
into
action
beyond
a
marshy
stream
which
ran
through
a
tangled
ravine
on
the
federal
flank
so
telling
was
his
fire
that
the
leading
brigade
wavered
and
gave
ground
and
though
meade
quickly
brought
up
his
guns
and
placed
his
third
brigade
en
potence
in
support
he
was
unable
to
continue
his
forward
movement
until
he
had
brushed
away
his
audacious
antagonist
the
four
pennsylvania
batteries
were
reinforced
by
two
others
but
rapidly
changing
his
position
as
often
as
the
federal
gunners
found
his
range
for
more
than
half
an
hour
pelham
defied
their
efforts
and
for
that
space
of
time
arrested
the
advance
of
meade
infantry
one
of
his
pieces
was
soon
disabled
but
with
the
remaining
gun
captured
from
the
enemy
six
months
before
he
maintained
the
unequal
fight
until
his
limbers
were
empty
and
he
received
peremptory
orders
from
stuart
to
withdraw
on
pelham
retirement
franklin
bringing
several
batteries
forward
to
the
richmond
road
for
more
than
half
an
hour
subjected
the
woods
before
him
to
a
heavy
cannonade
in
which
the
guns
on
the
stafford
heights
played
a
conspicuous
part
hidden
however
by
the
thick
timber
jackson
regiments
lay
secure
unharmed
by
the
tempest
that
crashed
above
them
through
the
leafless
branches
and
reserving
their
fire
for
the
hostile
infantry
his
guns
were
silent
the
general
meanwhile
according
to
his
custom
had
walked
far
out
into
the
fields
to
reconnoitre
for
himself
and
luck
favoured
the
confederacy
on
this
day
of
battle
lieutenant
smith
was
his
only
companion
and
a
federal
sharpshooter
suddenly
rising
from
some
tall
weeds
two
hundred
paces
distant
levelled
his
rifle
and
fired
the
bullet
whistled
between
their
heads
and
jackson
turning
with
a
smile
to
his
said
cheerfully
smith
had
you
not
better
go
to
the
rear
they
may
shoot
you
then
having
deliberately
noted
the
enemy
arrangements
he
returned
to
his
station
on
prospect
hill
it
was
past
eleven
before
meade
resumed
his
advance
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
his
first
line
was
within
eight
hundred
yards
of
jackson
centre
when
suddenly
the
silent
woods
awoke
to
life
the
confederate
batteries
pushing
forward
from
the
covert
came
rapidly
into
action
and
the
flash
and
thunder
of
more
than
fifty
guns
revealed
to
the
astonished
federals
the
magnitude
of
the
task
they
had
undertaken
from
front
and
flank
came
the
scathing
fire
the
skirmishers
were
quickly
driven
in
and
on
the
closed
ranks
behind
burst
the
full
fury
of
the
storm
dismayed
and
decimated
by
this
fierce
and
unexpected
onslaught
meade
brigades
broke
in
disorder
and
fell
back
to
the
richmond
road
for
the
next
hour
and
a
half
an
artillery
duel
in
which
over
guns
took
part
raged
over
the
whole
field
and
the
confederate
batteries
their
position
at
last
revealed
engaged
with
spirit
the
more
numerous
and
powerful
ordnance
of
the
enemy
then
franklin
brought
up
three
divisions
to
meade
support
and
from
the
smouldering
ruins
of
fredericksburg
three
miles
to
the
northward
beyond
the
high
trees
of
hazel
run
the
deep
columns
of
grand
division
deployed
under
the
fire
of
longstreet
guns
attack
had
been
for
some
time
in
progress
before
franklin
was
in
readiness
to
the
battle
was
now
fully
developed
and
the
morning
mists
had
been
succeeded
by
dense
clouds
of
smoke
shrouding
bill
and
plain
through
which
the
cannon
flashed
redly
and
the
defiant
yells
of
longstreet
riflemen
mingled
with
their
rattling
volleys
stirred
the
pulses
of
jackson
veterans
as
the
familiar
sounds
were
borne
to
their
ears
it
was
seen
that
the
dark
lines
beyond
the
richmond
road
were
moving
forward
and
the
turn
of
the
second
corps
had
come
it
was
one
and
jackson
guns
had
for
the
moment
ceased
their
fire
meade
pennsylvanians
had
rallied
gibbon
division
had
taken
post
on
their
right
biney
and
newton
were
in
support
and
doubleday
facing
south
was
engaged
with
stuart
dismounted
troopers
guns
on
the
right
and
thirty
on
the
left
stationed
on
the
richmond
road
a
thousand
yards
from
the
confederate
position
formed
a
second
tier
to
the
heavier
pieces
on
the
heights
and
fired
briskly
on
the
woods
preceded
by
clouds
of
skirmishers
meade
and
gibbon
advanced
in
column
of
brigades
at
three
hundred
paces
distance
the
whole
covering
a
front
of
a
thousand
yards
and
the
supporting
divisions
moved
up
to
the
richmond
road
when
the
federals
reached
the
scene
of
their
former
repulse
jackson
guns
again
opened
but
without
the
same
effect
for
they
were
now
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
enemy
batteries
at
close
range
even
pelham
could
do
but
little
and
the
artillery
beyond
the
railroad
on
hill
left
was
quickly
driven
in
meade
rear
brigade
was
now
brought
up
and
deployed
on
the
left
of
the
first
in
the
direction
of
the
massaponax
thus
further
extending
the
front
the
leading
brigade
made
straight
for
the
tongue
of
woodland
which
interposed
between
lane
and
archer
as
they
neared
the
confederate
line
the
pennsylvanians
masked
by
the
trees
found
that
they
were
no
longer
exposed
to
fire
and
that
the
coppice
was
unoccupied
quickly
crossing
the
border
through
swamp
and
undergrowth
they
pushed
their
way
and
bursting
from
the
covert
to
the
right
fell
on
the
exposed
flank
of
lane
brigade
the
fight
was
fierce
but
the
southerners
were
compelled
to
give
ground
for
neither
archer
nor
gregg
was
able
to
lend
assistance
meade
second
brigade
though
following
close
upon
the
first
had
instead
of
conforming
to
the
change
of
direction
against
flank
rushed
forward
through
the
wood
two
hundred
paces
from
the
embankment
it
came
in
contact
with
archer
left
which
was
resting
on
the
very
edge
of
the
coppice
the
confederates
were
taken
by
surprise
their
front
was
secured
by
a
strong
skirmish
line
but
on
the
flank
as
the
thickets
appeared
impenetrable
neither
scouts
nor
pickets
had
been
thrown
out
and
the
men
were
lying
with
arms
piled
two
regiments
leaping
to
their
feet
and
attempting
to
form
line
to
the
left
were
broken
by
a
determined
charge
and
gave
way
in
disorder
the
remainder
however
stood
firm
for
the
federals
instead
of
following
up
their
success
in
this
direction
left
archer
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
third
brigade
of
the
division
which
had
now
reached
the
railroad
and
swept
on
towards
the
military
road
where
gregg
brigade
was
drawn
up
within
the
forest
so
thick
was
the
cover
and
so
limited
the
view
that
general
gregg
taking
the
advancing
mass
for
part
of
archer
line
retiring
restrained
the
fire
of
his
men
the
federals
broke
upon
his
right
he
himself
fell
mortally
wounded
his
flank
regiment
a
battalion
of
conscripts
fled
except
one
company
without
firing
a
shot
the
two
regiments
on
the
opposite
flank
however
were
with
great
readiness
turned
about
and
changing
front
inwards
arrested
the
movement
of
the
enemy
along
the
rear
the
federals
had
now
been
joined
by
a
portion
of
the
first
brigade
inspirited
by
their
victory
over
lane
and
the
moment
to
all
appearance
seemed
critical
in
the
extreme
for
the
confederates
to
the
left
rear
of
the
attacking
column
meade
third
brigade
was
held
in
check
by
walker
batteries
and
the
sturdy
archer
who
notwithstanding
that
a
strong
force
had
passed
beyond
his
flank
and
had
routed
two
of
his
regiments
still
resolutely
held
his
ground
and
prevented
his
immediate
opponents
from
joining
the
intruding
column
to
the
right
rear
opposite
pender
gibbon
division
had
been
checked
by
the
fire
of
the
great
battery
near
bernard
cabin
two
of
his
brigades
had
been
driven
back
and
the
third
had
with
difficulty
gained
the
shelter
of
the
embankment
so
from
neither
left
nor
right
was
immediate
support
to
be
expected
by
meade
victorious
regiments
but
on
the
richmond
road
were
the
divisions
of
birney
and
newton
with
doubleday
and
sickles
not
far
in
rear
and
bayonets
might
have
been
thrown
rapidly
into
the
gap
which
the
pennsylvanians
had
so
vigorously
forced
yet
jackson
equanimity
was
undisturbed
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
the
thick
timber
hid
the
fighting
in
the
centre
from
his
post
of
observation
on
prospect
hill
and
the
first
intimation
of
the
enemy
success
was
brought
by
an
galloping
wildly
up
the
slope
general
he
exclaimed
in
breathless
haste
the
enemy
have
broken
through
archer
left
and
general
gregg
says
he
must
have
help
or
he
and
general
archer
will
both
lose
their
position
jackson
turned
round
quietly
and
without
the
least
trace
of
excitement
in
either
voice
or
manner
sent
orders
to
early
and
taliaferro
in
third
line
to
advance
with
the
bayonet
and
clear
the
front
then
with
rare
for
the
fighting
instinct
was
strong
within
him
and
the
danger
was
so
threatening
as
to
have
justified
his
personal
interference
he
raised
his
and
resumed
his
scrutiny
of
the
enemy
reserves
on
the
richmond
road
his
confidence
in
his
lieutenants
was
not
misplaced
division
already
deployed
in
line
came
forward
with
a
rush
and
the
stonewall
brigade
responding
with
alacrity
to
jackson
summons
led
the
advance
of
taliaferro
the
counterstroke
was
vigorous
meade
brigades
had
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
the
confederate
position
but
their
numbers
were
reduced
to
less
than
bayonets
in
the
fierce
fighting
and
dense
thickets
they
had
lost
all
semblance
of
cohesion
and
not
a
single
regiment
had
supported
them
the
men
looked
round
in
vain
for
help
and
the
forest
around
them
resounded
with
the
yells
of
the
confederate
reinforcements
assailed
in
front
and
flank
by
a
destructive
fire
the
pennsylvanians
were
rapidly
borne
back
hill
second
line
joined
in
early
advance
gibbon
was
strongly
attacked
six
brigades
sweeping
forward
from
the
forest
dashed
down
the
slopes
and
in
a
few
moments
the
broken
remnants
of
the
federal
divisions
were
dispersing
in
panic
across
the
plain
as
the
enemy
fled
the
confederate
gunners
disregarding
the
shells
of
franklin
batteries
poured
a
heavy
fire
into
the
receding
mass
and
although
instructions
had
been
given
that
the
counterstroke
was
not
to
pass
the
railroad
hoke
and
atkinson
brigades
of
early
division
carried
away
by
success
and
deaf
to
all
orders
followed
in
swift
pursuit
some
of
birney
regiments
tardily
coming
forward
to
support
were
swept
away
and
the
yelling
line
of
grey
infantry
shooting
down
the
fugitives
and
taking
many
prisoners
pressed
on
towards
the
richmond
road
there
the
remainder
of
birney
division
was
drawn
up
protected
by
the
bank
and
flanked
by
artillery
yet
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
the
two
confederate
brigades
would
carry
all
before
them
the
troops
of
meade
and
gibbon
were
streaming
in
confusion
to
the
rear
two
batteries
had
been
abandoned
and
before
hake
onset
the
left
of
birney
infantry
gave
ground
for
fifty
yards
but
the
rash
advance
had
reached
its
climax
unsupported
and
with
empty
the
southerners
were
unable
to
face
the
fire
from
the
road
sixteen
guns
had
opened
on
them
with
canister
and
after
suffering
heavy
losses
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
they
withdrew
in
disorder
but
unpursued
the
success
of
the
second
army
corps
was
greater
than
even
jackson
realised
meade
and
gibbon
had
lost
officers
and
men
and
it
was
not
till
late
in
the
afternoon
that
they
were
rallied
on
the
river
bank
the
casualties
in
birney
division
swelled
the
total
to
and
the
confederate
counterstroke
had
inflicted
a
heavier
blow
than
the
tale
of
losses
indicates
not
only
the
troops
which
had
been
engaged
but
those
who
had
witnessed
their
defeat
who
had
seen
them
enter
the
enemy
position
and
who
knew
they
should
have
been
supported
were
much
disheartened
at
soon
after
the
repulse
of
hake
and
atkinson
burnside
having
just
witnessed
the
signal
failure
of
a
fourth
assault
on
longstreet
sent
an
urgent
order
to
franklin
to
renew
his
attack
franklin
made
no
response
he
had
lost
all
confidence
both
in
his
superior
and
his
men
and
he
took
upon
himself
to
disobey
on
the
confederate
side
taliaferro
and
early
with
part
of
the
light
division
now
held
the
railway
embankment
and
the
skirt
of
the
woods
hill
was
brought
up
into
third
line
and
the
shattered
brigades
of
hill
were
withdrawn
to
the
rear
during
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
the
skirmishers
were
actively
engaged
but
although
jackson
victorious
soldiery
long
and
eagerly
expected
a
renewal
of
the
assault
the
enemy
refused
to
be
again
tempted
to
close
quarters
on
the
left
meanwhile
where
the
battle
still
raged
the
confederates
were
equally
successful
against
an
impregnable
position
northerners
were
madly
hurled
by
the
general
of
choice
by
those
hapless
and
soldiers
sacrificed
to
incompetency
a
heroism
was
displayed
which
won
the
praise
and
the
pity
of
their
opponents
the
attack
was
insufficiently
prepared
and
feebly
supported
by
the
artillery
the
troops
were
formed
on
a
narrow
front
marye
hill
the
strongest
portion
of
the
position
where
the
confederate
infantry
found
shelter
behind
a
stout
stone
wall
and
numerous
batteries
occupied
the
commanding
ground
in
rear
was
selected
for
assault
neither
feint
nor
demonstration
the
ordinary
expedients
by
which
the
attacker
seeks
to
distract
the
attention
and
confuse
the
efforts
of
the
defence
was
made
use
of
and
yet
division
after
division
with
no
abatement
of
courage
marched
in
good
order
over
the
naked
plain
dashed
forward
with
ranks
and
then
receding
sullenly
before
the
storm
of
fire
left
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
stone
wall
a
long
line
of
writhing
forms
to
mark
the
limit
of
their
advance
two
army
corps
had
been
repulsed
by
longstreet
with
fearful
slaughter
when
meade
and
gibbon
gave
way
before
jackson
counterstroke
and
by
three
nearly
of
the
federal
army
was
broken
and
demoralised
the
time
appeared
to
have
come
for
a
general
advance
of
the
confederates
before
fredericksburg
the
wreck
of
sumner
grand
division
was
still
clinging
to
such
cover
as
the
ground
afforded
on
the
richmond
road
in
front
of
jackson
franklin
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
the
offensive
and
was
bringing
up
his
last
reserves
to
defend
his
line
the
confederates
on
the
other
hand
were
in
the
highest
spirits
and
had
lost
but
few
general
lee
arrangements
however
had
not
included
preparation
for
a
great
counterstroke
and
such
a
movement
is
not
easily
improvised
the
position
had
been
occupied
for
defensive
purposes
alone
there
was
no
general
reserve
no
large
and
intact
force
which
could
have
moved
to
the
attack
immediately
the
opportunity
offered
no
skill
says
longstreet
could
have
marshalled
our
troops
for
offensive
operations
in
time
to
meet
the
emergency
my
line
was
long
and
over
broken
country
so
much
so
that
the
troops
could
not
be
promptly
handled
in
offensive
operations
jackson
corps
was
in
mass
and
could
he
have
anticipated
the
result
of
my
battle
he
would
have
been
justified
in
pressing
franklin
to
the
river
when
the
battle
of
the
latter
was
lost
otherwise
pursuit
would
have
been
as
unwise
as
the
attack
he
had
just
driven
off
it
is
well
known
that
after
driving
off
attacking
forces
if
immediate
pursuit
can
be
made
so
that
the
victors
can
go
along
with
the
retreating
forces
it
is
well
enough
to
do
so
but
the
attack
should
be
immediate
to
follow
a
success
by
against
the
enemy
in
position
is
problematical
battles
and

volume
pages
moreover
so
large
was
the
so
limited
the
view
by
reason
of
the
woods
and
with
such
ease
had
the
federal
attacks
been
repulsed
that
general
lee
was
unaware
of
the
extent
of
his
success
ignorant
too
as
he
necessarily
was
of
the
mistrust
and
want
of
confidence
in
its
leaders
with
which
the
federal
army
was
infected
he
was
far
from
suspecting
what
a
strong
ally
he
had
in
the
hearts
of
his
enemies
while
on
the
other
hand
the
inaccessible
batteries
on
the
stafford
heights
were
an
outward
and
visible
token
of
unabated
strength
jackson
however
although
the
short
winter
day
was
already
closing
in
considered
that
the
attempt
was
worth
making
about
he
had
seen
a
feeble
attack
on
the
confederate
centre
repulsed
by
hood
and
pender
and
about
the
same
time
he
received
information
of
longstreet
success
franklin
meanwhile
was
reforming
his
lines
behind
the
high
banks
of
the
richmond
road
and
the
approach
of
his
reserves
plainly
visible
from
the
confederate
position
seemed
to
presage
a
renewed
attack
i
waited
some
time
says
jackson
to
receive
it
but
he
making
no
forward
movement
i
determined
if
prudent
to
do
so
myself
the
artillery
of
the
enemy
was
so
judiciously
posted
as
to
make
an
advance
of
our
troops
across
the
plain
very
hazardous
yet
it
was
so
promising
of
good
results
if
successfully
executed
as
to
induce
me
to
make
preparations
for
the
attempt
in
order
to
guard
against
disaster
the
infantry
was
to
be
preceded
by
artillery
and
the
movement
postponed
until
late
in
the
afternoon
so
that
if
compelled
to
retire
it
would
be
under
cover
of
the
night

volume

jackson
decision
was
not
a
little
influenced
by
stuart
or
rather
by
the
reports
which
stuart
who
had
sent
out
staff
officers
to
keep
the
closest
watch
on
the
enemy
movements
had
been
able
to
furnish
of
the
demoralised
condition
of
a
great
part
of
franklin
force
the
cavalry
general
as
soon
as
he
verified
the
truth
of
these
reports
in
person
galloped
off
to
confer
with
jackson
on
prospect
hill
and
a
message
was
at
once
sent
to
lee
requesting
permission
for
an
advance
a
single
cannon
shot
was
to
be
the
signal
for
a
general
attack
which
stuart
striking
the
enemy
in
flank
was
to
initiate
with
his
two
brigades
and
the
lighter
guns
returning
to
our
position
to
quote
stuart
chief
of
staff
we
awaited
in
anxious
silence
the
desired
signal
but
minute
after
minute
passed
by
and
the
dark
veil
of
the
winter
night
began
to
envelop
the
valley
when
stuart
believing
that
the
summons
agreed
upon
had
been
given
issued
the
order
to
advance
off
we
went
into
the
gathering
darkness
our
sharpshooters
driving
their
opponents
easily
before
them
and
pelham
with
his
guns
pushing
ahead
at
a
trot
giving
them
a
few
shots
whenever
the
position
seemed
favourable
and
then
again
pressing
forward
this
lasted
about
twenty
minutes
when
the
fire
of
the
enemy
infantry
began
to
be
more
and
more
destructive
and
other
fresh
batteries
opened
upon
us
still
all
remained
silent
upon
our
main
line
our
situation
had
become
indeed
a
critical
one
when
a
courier
from
general
jackson
galloped
up
at
full
speed
bringing
the
order
for
stuart
to
retreat
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
his
original
position
under
cover
of
the
night
this
retrograde
movement
was
effected
without
loss
and
the
cavalry
as
they
marched
back
saw
the
kindling
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
and
the
infantry
digging
intrenchments
by
the
fitful
glare
the
second
corps
had
not
come
into
action
jackson
had
issued
orders
that
every
gun
of
whatever
calibre
or
range
which
was
not
disabled
should
be
brought
to
the
front
and
open
fire
at
sunset
and
that
as
soon
as
the
enemy
showed
signs
of
wavering
the
infantry
should
charge
with
fixed
bayonets
and
sweep
the
invaders
into
the
river
hood
division
which
had
been
temporarily
placed
at
his
disposal
was
instructed
to
advance
and
retreat
hood
page
it
appears
however
that
it
had
not
been
easy
in
the
short
space
of
daylight
still
available
to
remedy
the
confusion
into
which
the
confederates
had
been
thrown
by
meade
attack
and
their
own
counterstroke
the
divisions
were
to
some
extent
mixed
up
several
regiments
had
been
broken
and
the
ammunition
of
both
infantry
and
artillery
needed
replenishment
moreover
it
was
difficult
in
the
extreme
to
bring
the
batteries
forward
through
the
forest
and
when
they
eventually
arrived
the
strength
of
the
federal
position
was
at
once
revealed
line
was
defended
by
a
hundred
and
sixteen
field
pieces
generally
of
superior
metal
to
those
of
the
confederates
and
the
guns
on
the
stafford
heights
of
which
at
least
thirty
bore
upon
jackson
front
were
still
in
action
as
the
first
confederate
battery
advanced
this
great
array
of
artillery
which
had
been
for
some
time
comparatively
quiet
reopened
with
vigour
and
to
use
jackson
words
so
completely
swept
our
front
as
to
satisfy
me
that
the
proposed
movement
should
be
abandoned
but
he
was
not
yet
at
the
end
of
his
resources
a
strong
position
which
can
not
be
turned
is
not
always
impregnable
if
the
ground
be
favourable
and
few
obstacles
exist
a
night
attack
with
the
bayonet
especially
if
the
enemy
be
exhausted
or
has
many
chances
of
success
and
during
the
evening
jackson
made
arrangements
for
such
a
movement
he
asked
me
says
mcguire
how
many
yards
of
bandaging
i
had
and
when
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
the
exact
number
but
that
i
had
enough
for
another
fight
he
seemed
a
little
worried
at
my
lack
of
information
and
showed
his
annoyance
i
repeated
rather
shortly
i
have
enough
for
another
battle
meaning
to
imply
that
this
was
all
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
i
then
asked
him
why
do
you
want
to
know
how
much
bandaging
i
have
he
said
i
want
a
yard
of
bandaging
to
put
on
the
arm
of
every
soldier
in
this
night
attack
so
that
the
men
may
know
each
other
from
the
enemy
i
told
him
i
had
not
enough
cotton
cloth
for
any
such
purpose
and
that
he
would
have
to
take
a
piece
of
the
shirt
tail
of
each
soldier
to
supply
the
cloth
but
unfortunately
half
of
them
had
no
shirts
the
expedient
was
never
tried
general
lee
decided
that
the
attack
would
be
too
hazardous
letter
to
the
author
that
night
both
armies
lay
on
their
arms
burnside
notwithstanding
that
he
spent
several
hours
amongst
the
troops
before
fredericksburg
and
found
that
both
officers
and
men
were
opposed
to
further
attack
decided
to
renew
the
battle
the
next
day
his
arrangements
became
known
to
lee
an
officer
or
orderly
carrying
dispatches
having
strayed
within
the
confederate
outposts
from
manassas
to
appomattox
page
and
the
southern
generals
looked
forward
on
the
morning
of
the
to
a
fresh
attack
a
more
crushing
repulse
and
a
general
counterstroke
such
cheerful
anticipations
however
so
often
entertained
by
generals
holding
a
strong
defensive
position
are
but
seldom
realised
and
fredericksburg
was
no
exception
the
confederates
spent
the
night
in
diligent
preparation
supplies
of
ammunition
were
brought
up
and
distributed
the
existing
defences
were
repaired
abattis
cut
and
laid
and
fresh
earthworks
thrown
up
jackson
as
usual
on
the
eve
of
battle
was
still
working
while
others
rested
until
near
midnight
he
sat
up
writing
and
dispatching
orders
then
throwing
himself
booted
and
spurred
on
his
camp
bed
he
slept
for
two
or
three
hours
when
he
again
arose
lighted
his
candle
and
resumed
his
writing
before
four
he
sent
to
his
medical
director
to
inquire
as
to
the
condition
of
general
gregg
mcguire
reported
that
his
case
was
hopeless
and
jackson
requested
that
he
would
go
over
and
see
that
he
had
everything
he
wished
somewhat
against
his
will
for
there
were
many
wounded
who
required
attention
the
medical
officer
rode
off
but
scarcely
had
he
entered
the
farmhouse
where
gregg
was
lying
than
he
heard
the
tramp
of
horses
and
jackson
himself
dismounted
on
the
threshold
the
brigadier
it
appears
had
lately
fallen
under
the
ban
of
his
displeasure
but
from
the
moment
his
condition
was
reported
jackson
forgot
everything
but
the
splendid
services
he
had
rendered
on
so
many
fields
and
in
his
anxiety
that
every
memory
should
be
effaced
which
might
embitter
his
last
moments
he
had
followed
mcguire
to
his
bedside
the
interview
was
brief
and
the
dying
soldier
was
the
happier
for
it
but
the
scene
in
that
lonely
virginian
homestead
where
in
the
dark
hours
of
the
chill
december
morning
the
life
of
a
strong
man
of
a
gallant
comrade
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
of
an
unselfish
patriot
for
gregg
was
all
these
was
slowly
ebbing
made
a
deeper
impression
on
those
who
witnessed
it
than
the
accumulated
horrors
of
the
sadly
and
silently
the
general
and
his
staff
officer
rode
back
through
the
forest
where
the
troops
were
already
stirring
round
the
smouldering
their
thoughts
were
sombre
the
confederacy
with
a
relatively
slender
population
could
ill
spare
such
men
as
gregg
and
yet
jackson
though
yielding
to
the
depression
of
the
moment
and
deploring
the
awful
sacrifices
which
the
defence
of
her
liberties
imposed
upon
the
south
was
in
no
melting
mood
mcguire
when
they
reached
headquarters
put
a
question
as
to
the
best
means
of
coping
with
the
overwhelming
numbers
of
the
enemy
kill
them
sir
kill
every
man
was
the
reply
of
the
stern
soldier
who
but
just
now
with
words
of
tender
sympathy
and
christian
hope
had
bade
farewell
to
his
dying
comrade
but
on
december
as
on
the
morrow
of
sharpsburg
the
confederates
were
doomed
to
disappointment
darkness
still
prevailed
writes
stuart
chief
of
the
staff
when
we
mounted
our
horses
and
again
hastened
to
prospect
hill
the
summit
of
which
we
reached
just
in
time
to
see
the
sun
rising
and
unveiling
as
it
dispersed
the
haze
the
long
lines
of
the
federal
army
which
once
more
stood
in
full
line
of
battle
between
our
own
position
and
the
river
i
could
not
withhold
my
admiration
as
i
looked
down
upon
the
ranks
of
our
antagonists
astonished
that
these
troops
now
offering
so
bold
a
front
should
be
the
same
whom
not
many
hours
since
i
had
seen
in
complete
flight
and
disorder
the
skirmishers
of
the
two
armies
were
not
much
more
than
a
hundred
yards
apart
concealed
from
each
other
view
by
the
high
grass
in
which
they
were
lying
and
above
which
from
time
to
time
rose
a
small
cloud
of
blue
smoke
telling
that
a
shot
had
been
fired
as
the
boom
of
artillery
began
to
sound
from
different
parts
of
the
line
and
the
attack
might
be
expected
every
minute
each
hastened
to
his
post
but
though
the
skirmishing
at
times
grew
hotter
and
the
fire
of
the
artillery
more
rapid
long
intervals
of
silence
succeeded
until
it
at
length
became
apparent
to
the
confederates
that
the
enemy
though
well
prepared
to
resist
attack
was
determined
not
to
fight
outside
his
breastworks
burnside
indeed
giving
way
to
the
remonstrances
of
his
subordinates
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
further
aggressive
action
and
unless
lee
should
move
forward
had
determined
to
recross
the
potomac
the
next
morning
saw
the
armies
in
the
same
positions
and
the
federal
wounded
many
of
whom
had
been
struck
down
nearly
hours
before
still
lying
untended
between
the
hostile
lines
it
was
not
till
now
that
burnside
admitted
his
defeat
by
sending
a
flag
of
truce
with
a
request
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
bury
his
dead
when
the
flag
of
truce
says
major
hotchkiss
was
received
by
general
jackson
he
asked
me
for
paper
and
pencil
and
began
a
letter
to
be
sent
in
reply
but
after
writing
a
few
lines
he
handed
the
paper
back
and
sent
a
personal
message
by
captain
smith
captain
smith
writes
the
general
said
to
me
before
i
went
out
to
meet
colonel
sumner
representing
the
federals
if
you
are
asked
who
is
in
command
of
your
right
do
not
tell
them
i
am
and
be
guarded
in
your
remarks
it
so
happened
that
colonel
sumner
was
the
of
colonel
long
an
officer
on
general
lee
staff
while
we
were
together
another
federal
officer
named
junkin
rode
up
he
was
the
brother
or
cousin
of
jackson
first
wife
and
i
had
known
him
before
the
war
after
some
conversation
junkin
asked
me
to
give
his
regards
to
general
jackson
and
to
deliver
a
message
from
the
reverend
junkin
the
father
of
his
first
wife
i
replied
i
will
do
so
with
pleasure
when
i
meet
general
jackson
junkin
smiled
and
said
it
is
not
worth
while
for
you
to
try
to
deceive
us
we
know
that
general
jackson
is
in
front
of
us
the
same
night
a
fierce
storm
swept
the
valley
of
the
rappahannock
and
the
army
of
the
potomac
repassed
the
bridges
evading
under
cover
of
the
elements
the
observation
of
the
confederate
patrols
the
retreat
was
effected
with
a
skill
which
did
much
credit
to
the
federal
staff
within
fourteen
hours
troops
with
the
whole
of
their
guns

waggons
were
conveyed

there

to

to

the

in

victory
was
dashed
by
disappointment
burnside
escape
had
demonstrated
the
fallacy
of
one
of
the
rules
of
war
the
great
river
which
lay
behind
him
during
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
had
proved
his
salvation
instead
of
as
it
theoretically
should
his
ruin
over
the
six
bridges
his
troops
had
more
lines
of
retreat
than
is
usually
the
case
when
roads
only
are
available
and
these
lines
of
retreat
were
secure
protected
from
the
confederate
cavalry
by
the
river
and
from
the
infantry
and
artillery
by
the
batteries
on
the
stafford
heights
had
the
battle
been
fought
on
the
north
anna
miles
from
fredericksburg
the
result
might
have
been
very
different
a
direct
counterstroke
would
possibly
have
been
no
more
practicable
than
on
the
rappahannock
for
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
and
his
powerful
artillery
could
not
have
been
disregarded
nor
would
a
direct
pursuit
have
been
a
certain
means
of
making
success
decisive
the
rear
of
a
retreating
army
as
the
confederates
had
found
to
their
cost
at
malvern
hill
is
usually
its
strongest
part
but
a
pursuit
directed
against
the
flanks
striking
the
line
of
retreat
cutting
off
the
supply
and
ammunition
trains
and
blocking
the
roads
a
pursuit
such
as
jackson
had
organised
when
he
drove
banks
from
the
valley
if
conducted
with
vigour
seldom
fails
in
its
effect
and
who
would
have
conducted
such
an
operation
with
greater
skill
and
energy
than
stuart
at
the
head
of
his
horsemen
who
would
have
supported
stuart
more
expeditiously
than
the
of
the
second
army
corps
lee
position
at
fredericksburg
strong
as
it
might
appear
was
exceedingly
disadvantageous
a
position
which
an
army
occupies
with
a
view
to
decisive
battle
should
fulfil
four
requirements
it
should
not
be
too
strong
or
the
enemy
will
not
attack
it
it
should
give
cover
to
the
troops
both
from
view
and
fire
from
artillery
and
have
a
good
field
of
fire
it
should
afford
facilities
for
counterstroke
it
should
afford
facilities
for
pursuit
of
these
lee
fulfilled
but
the
first
and
second
it
would
have
been
an
admirable
selection
if
the
sole
object
of
the
confederates
had
been
to
gain
time
or
to
prevent
the
enemy
establishing
himself
south
of
the
rappahannock
but
to
encompass
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
whole
army
it
was
as
ill
adapted
as
wellington
position
at
torres
vedras
at
busaco
or
at
fuentes
but
while
wellington
in
taking
up
these
positions
had
no
further
end
in
view
than
holding
the
french
in
check
the
situation
of
the
confederacy
was
such
that
a
decisive
victory
was
eminently
desirable
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
gaining
time
the
south
could
furnish
lee
with
no
further
reinforcements
every
man
was
in
the
service
of
his
country
and
it
was
perfectly
certain
that
the
western
armies
although
they
had
been
generally
successful
during
the
past
year
would
never
be
permitted
by
davis
to
leave
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
not
likely
to
be
stronger
or
more
efficient
equipped
with
the
spoils
of
many
victories
it
was
more
on
a
level
with
the
enemy
than
had
hitherto
been
the
case
the
ranks
were
full
the
men
were
inured
to
hardships
and
swift
marches
their
health
was
proof
against
inclement
weather
and
they
knew
their
work
on
the
field
of
battle
the
artillery
had
recently
been
reorganised
during
the
peninsular
campaign
the
batteries
had
been
attached
to
the
infantry
brigades
and
the
indifferent
service
they
had
often
rendered
had
been
attributed
to
the
difficulty
of
collecting
the
scattered
units
and
in
handling
them
in
combination
formed
into
battalions
of
four
or
six
batteries
a
large
number
of
guns
was
now
attached
to
each
of
the
divisions
and
each
army
corps
had
a
strong
reserve
so
that
the
concentration
of
a
heavy
force
of
artillery
on
any
part
of
a
position
became
a
feasible
operation
the
cavalry
so
admirably
commanded
by
stuart
hampton
and
the
younger
lees
was
not
less
hardy
or
efficient
than
the
infantry
and
the
morale
of
the
soldiers
of
every
arm
founded
on
confidence
in
themselves
not
less
than
on
confidence
in
their
leaders
was
never
higher
after
the
truce
had
been
agreed
upon
says
captain
smith
to
bring
away
the
dead
and
wounded
were
selected
from
the
command
of
general
rodes
when
they
had
fallen
in
general
rodes
said
to
them
now
boys
those
yankees
are
going
to
ask
you
questions
and
you
must
not
tell
them
anything
be
very
careful
about
this
at
this
juncture
one
of
the
men
spoke
up
and
said
general
ca
we
tell
them
that
we
whipped
them
yesterday
rodes
replied
laughing
yes
yes
you
can
tell
them
that
immediately
another
man
spoke
up
general
ca
we
tell
them
that
we
can
whip
them
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
rodes
again
laughed
and
sent
those
incorrigible
jokers
off
with
yes
yes
go
on
go
on
tell
them
what
you
please
the
army
of
the
potomac
on
the
other
hand
was
not
likely
to
become
weaker
or
less
formidable
if
time
were
allowed
it
to
recuperate
it
had
behind
it
enormous
reserves
men
had
been
killed
wounded
or
captured
since
the
battle
of
kernstown
and
yet
the
ranks
were
as
full
as
when
mcclellan
first
marched
on
richmond
many
generals
had
disappeared
but
those
who
remained
were
learning
their
trade
and
the
soldiers
although
more
familiar
with
defeat
than
victory
showed
little
diminution
of
martial
ardour
nor
had
the
strain
of
the
war
sapped
the
resources
of
the
north
her
trade
instead
of
dwindling
had
actually
increased
and
the
gaps
made
in
the
population
by
the
confederate
bullets
were
more
than
made
good
by
a
constant
influx
of
immigrants
from
europe
it
was
not
by
partial
triumphs
not
by
the
slaughter
of
a
few
brigades
by
defence
without
counterstroke
by
victories
without
pursuit
that
a
power
of
such
strength
and
vitality
could
be
compelled
to
confess
her
impotence
whether
some
overwhelming
disaster
a
jena
or
a
waterloo
followed
by
instant
invasion
would
have
subdued
her
stubborn
spirit
is
problematical
rome
survived
cannae
scotland
flodden
and
france
sedan
but
in
some
such
crowning
mercy
lay
the
only
hope
of
the
confederacy
and
had
the
army
of
the
potomac
as
it
was
been
drawn
forward
to
the
north
anna
it
might
have
been
utterly
destroyed
strategy
which
aims
only
at
repulsing
the
enemy
attack
is
not
the
path
to
victory
it
is
not
by
such
feeble
means
that
states
secure
or
protect
their
independence
to
occupy
a
position
where
stuart
cavalry
was
powerless
where
the
qualities
which
made
infantry
so
formidable
the
impetuosity
of
their
attack
the
swiftness
of
their
marches
had
no
field
for
display
and
where
the
enemy
had
free
scope
for
the
employment
of
his
artillery
his
strongest
arm
was
but
to
postpone
the
evil
day
it
had
been
well
for
the
confederacy
if
stonewall
jackson
whose
resolute
strategy
had
but
one
aim
and
that
aim
the
annihilation
of
the
enemy
had
been
the
supreme
director
of
her
councils
to
paraphrase
mahan
the
strategic
mistake
in
occupying
a
position
for
which
pursuit
was
impracticable
neutralised
the
tactical
advantage
gained
thus
confirming
the
military
maxim
that
a
strategic
mistake
is
more
serious
and
in
its
effects
than
an
error
in
tactics
lee
however
was
fettered
by
the
orders
of
the
cabinet
and
davis
and
his
advisers
more
concerned
with
the
importance
of
retaining
an
area
of
country
which
still
furnished
supplies
than
of
annihilating
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
relying
on
european
intervention
rather
than
on
the
valour
of
the
southern
soldier
were
responsible
for
the
occupation
of
the
fredericksburg
position
in
extenuation
of
their
mistake
it
may
however
be
admitted
that
the
advantages
of
concentration
on
the
north
anna
were
not
such
as
would
impress
themselves
on
the
civilian
mind
while
the
surrender
of
territory
would
undoubtedly
have
embarrassed
both
the
government
and
the
supply
department
moreover
at
the
end
of
november
it
might
have
been
urged
that
if
burnside
were
permitted
to
possess
himself
of
fredericksburg
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
he
would
advance
on
richmond
establishing
himself
in
winter
quarters
he
might
wait
until
the
weather
improved
controlling
in
the
meantime
the
resources
and
population
of
that
portion
of
virginia
which
lay
within
his
reach
nevertheless
as
events
went
far
to
prove
davis
would
have
done
wisely
had
he
accepted
the
advice
of
the
soldiers
on
the
spot
his
strategical
glance
was
less
comprehensive
than
that
of
lee
and
jackson
in
the
first
place
they
knew
that
if
burnside
proposed
going
into
winter
quarters
he
would
not
deliberately
place
the
rappahannock
between
himself
and
his
base
nor
halt
with
the
great
forest
of
spotsylvania
on
his
flank
in
the
second
place
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
the
northern
government
and
the
northern
people
would
impel
him
forward
the
tone
of
the
press
was
unmistakable
and
the
very
reason
that
burnside
had
been
appointed
to
command
was
because
mcclellan
was
so
slow
to
move
in
the
third
place
both
lee
and
jackson
saw
the
need
of
decisive
victory
with
them
questions
of
strategic
dispositions
offering
chances
of
such
victory
were
of
more
importance
than
questions
of
supply
or
internal
politics
they
knew
with
what
rapidity
the
federal
soldiers
recovered
their
morale
and
they
realised
but
too
keenly
the
stern
determination
which
inspired
the
north
they
had
seen
the
hosts
of
invasion
retire
in
swift
succession
stricken
and
exhausted
before
their
victorious
bayonets
thousands
of
prisoners
had
been
marched
to
richmond
thousands
of
wounded
abandoned
on
the
had
been
paroled
guns
waggons
and
small
arms
enough
to
equip
a
great
army
had
been
captured
and
general
after
general
had
been
reduced
to
the
ignominy
that
awaits
a
defeated
leader
fremont
and
shields
had
disappeared
banks
was
no
longer
in
the
field
porter
was
waiting
trial
mcdowell
had
gone
pope
had
gone
and
mcclellan
and
yet
the
army
of
the
potomac
still
held
its
ground
the
great
fleets
still
kept
their
stations
the
capture
of
richmond
was
still
the
objective
of
the
union
government
and
not
for
a
single
moment
had
lincoln
wavered
from
his
purpose
it
will
not
be
asserted
that
either
lee
or
jackson
fathomed
the
source
of
this
unconquerable
tenacity
they
had
played
with
effect
on
the
fears
of
lincoln
they
had
recognised
in
him
the
motive
power
of
the
federal
hosts
but
they
had
not
yet
learned
for
the
northern
people
themselves
had
not
yet
learned
it
that
they
were
opposed
by
an
adversary
whose
resolution
was
as
unyielding
as
their
own
who
loved
the
union
even
as
they
loved
virginia
and
who
ruled
the
nation
with
the
same
tact
and
skill
that
they
ruled
their
soldiers
in
these
pages
lincoln
has
not
been
spared
he
made
mistakes
and
he
himself
would
have
been
the
last
to
claim
infallibility
he
had
entered
the
white
house
with
a
rich
endowment
of
a
high
sense
of
duty
and
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
the
american
character
but
his
ignorance
of
statesmanship
directing
arms
was
great
and
his
military
errors
were
numerous
putting
these
aside
his
tenure
of
office
during
the
dark
days
of
and
had
been
marked
by
the
very
highest
political
sagacity
his
courage
and
his
patriotism
had
sustained
the
nation
in
its
distress
and
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
he
was
gradually
bringing
into
being
a
unity
of
sympathy
and
of
purpose
which
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
had
seemed
an
impossible
ideal
not
the
least
politic
of
his
measures
was
the
edict
of
emancipation
published
after
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
it
was
not
a
measure
without
flaw
it
contained
paragraphs
which
might
fairly
be
interpreted
and
were
so
interpreted
by
the
confederates
as
inciting
the
negroes
to
rise
against
their
masters
thus
exposing
to
all
the
horrors
of
a
servile
insurrection
with
its
accompaniments
of
murder
and
outrage
the
farms
and
plantations
where
the
women
and
children
of
the
south
lived
lonely
and
unprotected
but
if
the
edict
served
only
to
embitter
the
southerners
to
bind
the
whole
country
together
in
a
still
closer
league
of
resistance
and
to
make
peace
except
by
conquest
impossible
it
was
worth
the
price
the
party
in
the
north
which
fought
for
the
of
the
union
had
carried
on
the
war
with
but
small
success
the
tale
of
reverses
had
told
at
last
upon
recruiting
men
were
unwilling
to
come
forward
and
those
who
were
bribed
by
large
bounties
to
join
the
armies
were
of
a
different
character
to
the
original
volunteer
enthusiasm
in
the
cause
was
fast
diminishing
when
lincoln
purely
on
his
own
initiative
proclaimed
emancipation
and
investing
the
war
with
the
dignity
of
a
crusade
inspired
the
soldier
with
a
new
incentive
and
appealed
to
a
feeling
which
had
not
yet
been
stirred
many
northerners
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
fight
for
the
of
the
union
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
if
slavery
was
to
be
permitted
to
continue
they
preferred
separation
and
these
men
were
farmers
and
agriculturists
the
class
which
furnished
the
best
soldiers
men
of
american
birth
for
the
most
part
abolitionists
and
ready
to
fight
for
the
principle
they
had
so
much
at
heart
it
is
true
that
the
effect
of
the
edict
was
not
at
once
apparent
it
was
not
received
everywhere
with
acclamation
the
army
had
small
sympathy
with
the
coloured
race
and
the
political
opponents
of
the
president
accused
him
vehemently
of
unconstitutional
action
their
denunciations
however
missed
the
mark
the
letter
of
the
constitution
as
lincoln
clearly
saw
had
ceased
to
be
regarded
at
least
by
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
with
superstitious
reverence
they
had
learned
to
think
more
of
great
principles
than
of
political
expedients
and
if
the
defence
of
their
hereditary
rights
had
welded
the
south
into
a
nation
the
assertion
of
a
still
nobler
principle
the
liberty
of
man
placed
the
north
on
a
higher
plane
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
europe
and
completed
the
isolation
of
the
confederacy
but
although
lee
and
jackson
had
not
yet
penetrated
the
political
genius
of
their
great
antagonist
they
rated
at
its
true
value
the
vigour
displayed
by
his
administration
and
they
saw
that
something
more
was
wanting
to
wrest
their
freedom
from
the
north
than
a
mere
passive
resistance
to
the
invader
progress
soon
after
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
lee
went
to
richmond
and
laid
proposals
for
an
aggressive
campaign
before
the
president
he
was
assured
however
says
general
longstreet
that
the
war
was
virtually
over
and
that
we
need
not
harass
our
troops
by
marches
and
other
hardships
gold

advanced

we
were
told
by

in
the
confederate
capital
that
in
thirty
or
forty
days
we
would
be
recognised
by

did

far
to

rear
after
doing
much
damage
in
the
district
about
occoquan
and
dumfries
twenty
miles
from
headquarters
he
marched
northward
in
the
direction
of
washington
and
penetrated
as
far
as
burke
station
fifteen
miles
from
alexandria
sending
a
telegraphic
message
to
general
meigs
at
washington
to
the
effect
that
the
mules
furnished
to
burnside
army
were
of
such
bad
quality
that
he
was
embarrassed
in
taking
the
waggons
he
had
captured
into
the
confederate
lines
and
requesting
that
a
better
class
of
animal
might
be
supplied
in
future
he
returned
by
long
marches
through
warrenton
to
culpeper
court
house
escaping
pursuit
and
bringing
with
him
a
large
amount
of
plunder
and
many
prisoners
from
the
afternoon
of

to

on

he
rode
one
hundred

fifty

had
contrived
to
throw

part
of

to
meet
him
into
utter
confusion
by
intercepting
their
telegrams

manner
that
scattered

the

however
was
inclement
the

that

the

of

the
history
of

for
no

it

commanded

mutual
confidence

of
success
in

resolution
and
resources
of
their
chief
hesitation
and
are
sure
to
mark
their
actions
they
may
fight
with
their
accustomed
courage
but
the
eagerness
for
the
conflict
the
alacrity
to
support
the
determination
to
conquer

not
be

the
indefinable
quality
which
is
expressed
by
the
word
morale
will
to
some
degree
be
affected
the
history
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
is
a
case
in
point
between
the
soldiers
of
the
north
and
south
there
was
little
difference
neither
could
claim
a
superiority
of
martial
qualities
the
confederates
indeed
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
possessed
a
larger
measure
of
technical
skill
they
were
the
better
shots
and
the
finer
riders
but
they
were
neither
braver
nor
more
enduring
and
while
they
probably
derived
some
advantage
from
the
fact
that
they
were
defending
their
homes
the
federals
defending
the
integrity
of
their
native
land
were
fighting
in
the
noblest
of
all
causes
but
northerner
and
southerner
were
of
the
same
race
a
race
proud
resolute
independent
both
were
inspired
by
the
same
sentiments
of
noblesse
oblige
the
noblesse
of
a
free
people
was
the
motto
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
federal
armies
were
very
largely
composed
of
foreigners
whose
motives
for
enlisting
were
purely
mercenary
at
no
period
of
the
war
however
did
the
proportion
of
native
americans
sink
below
seventy
per
see
note
at
end
of

and
at
the
beginning
of

much
greater

of
thoroughly
staunch

ireland
and

supplied
the
greater
number
of
those
who
have
been
called
hirelings
and
judging
from
the
official
records
the
irish
regiments
at

were
not
a

trustworthy
than
those

the
reason
that
it

superior

numbers

its
ranks
many
more

in
the

than
the

john

the
irish

said
in
a
letter
to
the
dublin
nation
that
there
were
irishmen
in

times
february
for
the
consistent
of
the
federals
the
superior
marksmanship
and
finer
horsemanship
of
the
confederates
can
not
therefore
be
accepted
as
sufficient
explanation
in
defence
the
balance
of
endurance
inclined
neither
to
one
side
nor
the
other
both
southerner
and

displayed
that
stubborn
resolve
to
maintain
their
ground
which
is
the
peculiar
attribute
of
the
to
claim
for
any
one
race
a
of
valour
is
repugnant
alike
to
good
taste
and
to
sound
sense
courage
and
endurance
are
widely
distributed
over
the
world
surface
and
political
institutions
the
national
conception
of
duty
the
efficiency
of
the
corps
of
officers
and
love
of
country
are
the
foundation
of
vigour
and
staunchness
in
the
field
yet
it
is
a
fact
which
can
hardly
be
ignored
that
from
crecy
to
inkermann
there
have
been
exceedingly
few
instances
where
an
english
army
large
or
small
has
been
driven
from
a
position
in
the
great
struggle
with
france
neither
napoleon
nor
his
marshals
although
the
armies
of
every
other
european
nation
had
fled
before
them
could
boast
of
having
broken
the
english
infantry
and
no
soldiers
have
ever
received
a
prouder
tribute
than
the
admission
of
a
generous
enemy
they
never
know
when
they
are
beaten
in
america
the
characteristics
of
the
parent
race
were
as
prominent
in
the
civil
war
as
they
had
been
in
the
revolution
in
the
side
that
stood
on
the
defensive
unless
hopelessly
outnumbered
was
almost
invariably
successful
just
as
it
had
been
in
my
men
said
jackson
sometimes
fail
to
drive
the
enemy
from
his
position
but
to
hold
one
never
the
federal
generals
might
have
made
the
same
assertion
with
almost
equal
truth
porter
had
indeed
been
defeated
at
gaines
mill
but
he
could
only
set
in
line
against
banks
had
been
overwhelmed
at
winchester
but
men
could
hardly
have
hoped
to
resist
more
than
twice
their
strength
and
shields
advanced
guard
at
port
republic
was
much
inferior
to
the
force
which
jackson
brought
against
it
yet
these
were
the
only
offensive
victories
of
the
campaign
but
if
in
defence
the
armies
were
well
matched
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
northern
attack
was
not
pressed
with
the
same
concentrated
vigour
as
the
southern
mcclellan
at
sharpsburg
had
more
than
twice
as
many
men
as
lee
pope
on
the
first
day
of
the
second
manassas
twice
as
many
as
jackson
yet
on
both
occasions
the
smaller
force
was
victorious
but
in
the
first
place
the
federal
tactics
in
attack
were
always
feeble
lincoln
in
appointing
hooker
to
command
the
army
of
the
potomac
warned
him
to
put
in
all
his
men
his
sharp
eye
had
detected
the
great
fault
which
had
characterised
the
operations
of
his
generals
their
assaults
had
been
piecemeal
like
those
of
the
confederates
at
malvern
hill
and
they
had
been
defeated
in
detail
by
the
inferior
numbers
the
northern
soldiers
were
strangers
to
those
general
and
combined
attacks
pressed
with
unyielding
resolution
which
had
won
winchester
gaines
mill
and
the
second
manassas
and
which
had
nearly
won
kernstown
the
northern
generals
invariably
kept
large
masses
in
reserve
and
these
masses
were
never
used
they
had
not
yet
learned
as
had
lee
jackson
and
longstreet
that
superior
numbers
are
of
no
avail
unless
they
are
brought
into
action
impelling
the
attack
forward
by
sheer
weight
at
the
decisive
point
in
the
second
place
none
of
the
federal
leaders
possessed
the
entire
confidence
either
of
their
generals
or
their
troops
with
all
its
affection
for
mcclellan
it
may
strongly
be
questioned
whether
his
army
gave
him
credit
for
dash
or
resolution
pope
was
defeated
in
his
first
action
at
cedar
run
banks
at
winchester
frémont
west
of
staunton
had
both
been
burnside
had
against
him
his
feeble
conduct
at
sharpsburg
hence
the
federal
soldiers
fought
most
of
their
offensive
battles
under
a
terrible
disadvantage
they
were
led
by
men
who
had
known
defeat
and
who
owed
their
defeat
in
great
measure
to
the
same
fault
neglect
to
employ
their
whole
force
in
combination
brave
and
unyielding
as
they
were
the
troops
went
into
battle
mistrustful
of
their
leader
skill
and
fearful
from
the
very
outset
that
their
efforts
would
be
unsupported
and
when
men
begin
to
look
over
their
shoulders
for
reinforcements
demoralisation
is
not
far
off
it
would
be
untrue
to
say
that
a
defeated
general
can
never
regain
the
confidence
of
his
soldiers
but
unless
he
has
previous
successes
to
set
off
against
his
failure
to
permit
him
to
retain
his
position
is
dangerous
in
the
extreme
such
was
the
opinion
of
jackson
always
solicitous
of
the
morale
of
his
command
to
his
mind
nothing
ever
fully
excused
failure
and
it
was
rarely
that
he
gave
an
officer
the
opportunity
of
failing
twice
service
he
said
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
man
who
does
not
succeed
nor
was
he
ever
restrained
from
a
change
by
the
fear
of
making
matters
worse
his
motto
was
get
rid
of
the
unsuccessful
man
at
once
and
trust
to
providence
for
finding
a
better
nor
was
the
presence
of
discredited
generals
the
only
evil
which
went
to
neutralise
the
valour
of
the
federal
soldiers
the
system
of
command
was
as
rotten
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
as
in
the
armies
of
northern
virginia
and
of
the
valley
it
was
sound
and
the
system
of
command
plays
a
most
important
part
in
war
the
natural
initiative
of
the
american
the
general
fearlessness
of
responsibility
were
as
conspicuous
among
the
soldiers
as
in
the
nation
at
large
to
those
familiar
with
the
official
records
where
the
doings
of
regiments
and
even
companies
are
preserved
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
so
soon
as
the
officers
gained
experience
the
smaller
units
were
as
boldly
and
efficiently
handled
as
in
the
army
of
germany
under
moltke
but
while
lee
and
jackson
by
every
means
in
their
power
fostered
the
capacity
for
independent
action
following
therein
the
example
of
napoleon
in
the
opinion
of
the
author
the
charge
of
centralisation
preferred
against
napoleon
can
only
be
applied
to
his
leading
in
his
later
campaigns
in
his
earlier
operations
he
gave
his
generals
every
latitude
and
be
maintamed
that
loose
but
effective
system
of
tactics
in
which
much
was
left
to
the
individual
adopted
by
the
french
army
just
previous
to
the
wars
of
the
revolution
of
washington
of
nelson
and
of
wellington
and
aware
that
their
strength
would
thus
be
doubled
mcclellan
and
pope
did
their
best
to
stifle
it
and
in
the
higher
ranks
they
succeeded
in
the
one
case
the
generals
were
taught
to
wait
for
orders
in
the
other
to
anticipate
them
in
the
one
case
whether
troops
were
supported
or
not
depended
on
the
word
of
the
commanding
general
in
the
other
every
officer
was
taught
that
to
sustain
his
colleagues
was
his
first
duty
it
thus
resulted
that
while
the
confederate
leaders
were
served
by
scores
of
zealous
assistants
actively
engaged
in
furthering
the
aim
of
their
superiors
mcclellan
pope
and
fremont
jealous
of
power
reduced
their
subordinates
with
few
exceptions
to
the
position
of
machines
content
to
obey
the
letter
of
their
orders
oblivious
of
opportunity
and
incapable
of
lee
and
jackson
appear
to
have
realised
the
requirements
of
battle
far
more
fully
than
their
opponents
they
knew
that
the
scope
of
the
commander
is
limited
that
once
his
troops
are
committed
to
close
action
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
exert
further
control
for
his
orders
can
no
longer
reach
them
that
he
can
not
keep
the
whole
field
under
observation
much
less
observe
every
fleeting
opportunity
yet
it
is
by
utilising
opportunities
that
the
enemy
strength
is
sapped
for
these
reasons
the
confederate
generals
were
exceedingly
careful
not
to
chill
the
spirit
of
enterprise
errors
of
judgment
were
never
considered
in
the
light
of
crimes
while
the
officer
who
in
default
of
orders
remained
inactive
or
who
when
his
orders
were
manifestly
inapplicable
to
a
suddenly
changed
situation
and
there
was
no
time
to
have
them
altered
dared
not
act
for
himself
was
not
long
retained
in
responsible
command
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
on
the
other
hand
centralisation
was
the
rule
mcclellan
expected
blind
obedience
from
his
corps
commanders
and
nothing
more
and
pope
brought
porter
to
trial
for
using
his
own
judgment
on
occasions
when
pope
himself
was
absent
during
the
campaign
of
the
second
manassas
thus
the
federal
soldiers
through
no
fault
of
their
own
laboured
for
the
first
two
years
of
the
war
under
a
disadvantage
from
which
the
wisdom
of
lee
and
jackson
had
relieved
the
confederates
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
an
inert
mass
the
army
of
northern
virginia
a
living
organism
endowed
with
irresistible
vigour
it
is
to
be
noted
too
as
tending
to
prove
the
equal
courage
of
north
and
south
that
on
the
western
theatre
of
war
the
federals
were
the
more
successful
and
yet
the
western
armies
of
the
confederacy
were
neither
less
brave
less
hardy
nor
less
disciplined
than
those
in
virginia
they
were
led
however
by
inferior
men
while
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
northern
generals
opposed
to
them
possessed
unquestionable
ability
and
understood
the
value
of
a
good
system
of
command
we
may
say
then
without
detracting
an
iota
from
the
high
reputation
of
the
confederate
soldiers
that
it
was
not
the
army
of
northern
virginia
that
saved
richmond
in
but
lee
not
the
army
of
the
valley
which
won
the
valley
campaign
but
jackson
it
is
related
that
a
good
priest
once
a
chaplain
in
louisiana
brigade
concluded
his
prayer
at
the
unveiling
of
the
jackson
monument
in
new
orleans
with
these
remarkable
words
when
in
thine
inscrutable
decree
it
was
ordained
that
the

should
fail
it
became

it
is
unnecessary
perhaps
to

forcible
emphasis
on
the
personal

but
at
the
same
time
it
is
exceedingly
essential
that
it
should
never

in

davis

himself
a
soldier
who
as
united
states
secretary
of
war
had
enjoyed
peculiar
opportunities
of
estimating
the
character
of
the
officers
of
the
old
army
made
no
such
mistake
he
was
not
always
indeed
either
wise
or
consistent
but
with
few
exceptions
his
appointments
were
the
best
that
could
be
made
and
he
was
ready
to
accept
the
advice
as
regarded
selections
for
command
of
his
most
experienced
generals
but
however
may
be
the
influence
of
a
great
leader
in
estimating
his
capacity
the
temper
of
the
weapon
that
he
wielded
can
hardly
be
overlooked
in
the
first
place
that
temper
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
must
have
been
of
his
own
forging
it
is
part
of
his
fame
no
man
says
napier
can
be
justly
called
a
great
captain
who
does
not
know
how
to
organise

form
the
character
of
an
army
as
well
as
to
lead
it
when
formed
in
the
second
place
to
do
much
with
feeble
means
is
greater
than
to
do
more
with
large
resources
difficulties
are
inherent
in

operations

not
the
least
may
be
the
constitution
of
the

nor
would
the
story
of

be
more
than
half
told
without
large
reference
to
those
tried
soldiers
subalterns
and
private
soldiers
as
they
were
whom
he
looked
upon
as
his

whose
patriotism
and
endurance
he
extolled
so
highly
and
whose
devotion
to
himself
next
to
the
approval
of
his
own
conscience
was
the
reward
that
most
he
valued
he
is
blind
indeed
who
fails
to
recognise
the
unselfish
patriotism
displayed
by
the
of

the
stern
resolution
with
which
the

was
waged

tenacity
of
the
northerner

honours
that

bestow
nor
can

soldier
withhold
his
tribute
of
praise
to
the
capacity
for
making
war
which
distinguished
the
american
citizen
the
intelligence
of
the
rank
and
file
played
an
important
role
in
every
phase
of
a
campaign
as
skirmishers
and
modern
battles
to
a
very
great
extent
are
fought
out
by
lines
of
skirmishers
their
work
was
admirable
and
when
the
officers
were
struck
down
or
when
command
by
reason
of
the
din
and
excitement
became
impossible
the
of
the
individual
asserted
itself
with
the
best
effect
the
historical
student
may
profitably
compare
with
the
american
soldier
the
armies
of
revolutionary
france
in
which
education
and
intelligence
were
also
conspicuous
the

quality
which
the

sought
to
foster

and
in
counteracting
the
ruses
of
the

the
keen
intelligence
of
the
educated

was
of
the
utmost
value
history
has
hitherto
overlooked
the
achievements
of
the
scouts
whose
names
so
seldom
occur
in
the
official
records
but
whose
daring
was
unsurpassed
and
whose
services
were
of
vast
importance
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
every
commanding
general
had
his
own
party
of
scouts
whose
business
it
was
to
penetrate
the
enemy
lines
to
see
everything
and
to
hear
everything
to
visit
the
base
of
operations
to
inspect
the
line
of
communications
and
to
note
the
condition
and
the
temper
of
the
hostile
troops
attracted
by
a
pure
love
of
adventure
these
private
soldiers
did
exactly
the
same
work
as
did
the
english
intelligence
officers
in
the
peninsula
and
did
it
with
the
same
thoroughness
and
acuteness

that
the
gallant

was
worth
as
much
to

jackson

scouts
who
were
more
useful
to
him
than
many
of
his

the

rule
that
the

had
faults
however
due
in
great
part
to
the
fact
that
their
intelligence
was
not
thoroughly
trained

to
the
inexperience
of

in
the
actual
composition
of
the
confederate
forces
no
marked
change
had
taken
place
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
the
character
of
the
army
in
many
essential
respects
had
become
sensibly
modified
the
men
encamped
on
the
rappahannock
were
no
longer
the
raw
recruits
who
had
blundered
into
victory
at
the
first
manassas
nor
were
they
the
unmanageable
divisions
of
the
peninsula
they
were
still
for
the
most
part
volunteers
for
conscripts
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
were
not
numerous
but
they
were
volunteers
of
a
very
different
type
from
those
who
had
fought
at
kernstown
or
at
mill
despite
their
protracted
absence
from
their
homes
the
wealthy
and
privates
still
shouldered
the
musket
though
many
had
been
promoted
to
commissions
the
majority
were
content
to
set
an
example
of
and
sterling
patriotism
and
the
regiments
were
thus
still
leavened
with
a
large
admixture
of
educated
and
intelligent
men
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
during
those
months
of
which
were
spent
in
winter
quarters
latin
greek
mathematical
and
even
hebrew
classes
were
instituted
by
the
soldiers
but
all
trace
of
social
distinction
had
long
since
vanished
between
the
rich
planter
and
the
small
farmer
or
mechanic
there
was
no
difference
either
in
aspect
or
habiliments
tanned
by
the
hot
virginia
sun
and
gaunt
of
frame
and
spare
of
flesh
they
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
rank
and
file
of
the
confederate
army
the
product
of
discipline
and
hard
service
moulded
after
the
same
pattern
with
the
same
hopes
and
fears
the
same
needs
the
same
sympathies
they
looked
at
life
from
a
common
standpoint
and
that
standpoint
was
not
always
elevated
human
nature
claimed
its
rights
when
his
hunger
was
satisfied
and
to
use
his
own
expression
he
was
full
of
hog
and
hominy
the
confederate
soldier
found
time
to
discuss
the
operations
in
which
he
was
engaged
pipe
in
mouth
he
could
pass
in
review
the
strategy
and
tactics
of
both
armies
the
capacity
of
his
generals
and
the
bearing
of
his
enemies
and
on
each
one
of
these
questions
for
he
was
the
shrewdest
of
observers
his
comments
were
always
to
the
point
he
had
studied
his
profession
in
a
practical
school
the
more
delicate
moves
of
the
great
game
were
topics
of
absorbing
interest
he
cast
a
comprehensive
glance
over
the
whole
theatre
he
would
puzzle
out
the
reasons
for
forced
marches
and
sudden
changes
of
direction
his
curiosity
was
great
but
intelligent
and
the
groups
round
the
often
forecast
with
surprising
accuracy
the
manoeuvres
that
the
generals
were
planning
but
far
more
often
the
subjects
of
conversation
were
of
a
more
immediate
and
personal
character
the
capacity
of
the
company
cook
the
quality
of
the
last
consignment
of
boots
the
merits
of
different
bivouacs
the
prospect
of
the
supply
train
coming
up
to
time
the
temper
of
the
captain
and
subaltern
such
were
the
topics
which
the
confederate
privates
spent
their
leisure
in
discussing
they
had
long
since
discovered
that
war
is
never
romantic
and
seldom
exciting
but
a
monotonous
round
of
tiresome
duties
enlivened
at
rare
intervals
by
dangerous
episodes
they
had
become
familiar
with
its
constant
accompaniment
of
privations
bad
weather
wet
bivouacs
and
wretched
roads
wood
that
would
not
kindle
and
rations
that
did
not
satisfy
they
had
learned
that
a
soldier
worst
enemy
may
be
his
native
soil
in
the
form
of
dust
or
mud
that
it
is
possible
to
march
for
months
without
firing
a
shot
or
seeing
a
foe
that
a
battle
is
an
interlude
which
breaks
in
at
rare
intervals
on
the
long
round
of
digging
marching
and
and
that
the
time
of
the
fiercest
is
generally
occupied
in
escorting
in
mounting
guard
in
dragging
waggons
through
the
mud
and
in
loading
or
unloading
stores
volunteering
for
perilous
and
onerous
duties
for
which
hundreds
had
eagerly
offered
themselves
in
the
early
days
ere
the
glamour
of
the
soldier
life
had
vanished
had
ceased
to
be
popular
the
men
were
now
content
to
wait
for
orders
and
as
discipline
crystallised
into
habit
they
became
resigned
to
the
fact
that
they
were
no
longer
volunteers
masters
of
their
own
actions
but
the
paid
servants
of
the
state
compelled
to
obey
and
powerless
to
protest
to
all
outward
appearance
then
in
the
spring
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
bore
an
exceedingly
close
resemblance
to
an
army
of
professional
soldiers
it
is
true
that
military
etiquette
was
not
insisted
on
that
more
license
both
in
quarters
and
on
the
march
was
permitted
than
would
be
the
case
in
a
regular
army
that
officers
were
not
treated
with
the
same
respect
and
that
tact
rather
than
the
strict
enforcement
of
the
regulations
was
the
of
command
nevertheless
taken
as
a
whole
the
confederate
soldiers
were
exceedingly
the
good
elements
in
the
ranks
were
too
strong
for
those
who
were
inclined
to
resist
authority
and
the
amount
of
misbehaviour
was
wonderfully
small
there
was
little
neglect
of
duty
whatever
the
intelligence
of
the
men
told
them
was
necessary
for
success
for
safety
or
for
efficiency
was
done
without
reluctance
the
outposts
were
seldom
caught
napping
digging
and
for
the
men
had
learned
the
value
of
making
fortifications
and
good
roads
were
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
nor
was
the
southern
soldier
a
grumbler
he
accepted
and
muddy
without
remonstrance
if
his
boots
wore
out
he
made
shift
to
march
without
them
and
when
his
uniform
fell
to
pieces
he
waited
for
the
next
victory
to
supply
himself
with
a
new
outfit
he
was
enough
of
a
philosopher
to
know
that
it
is
better
to
meet
misery
with
a
smile
than
with
a
scowl
mark
tapley
had
many
prototypes
in
the
confederate
ranks
and
the
men
were
never
more
facetious
than
when
things
were
at
their
worst
the
very
intensity
of
their
sufferings
became
a
source
of
merriment
instead
of
growling
and
deserting
they
laughed
at
their
own
bare
feet
ragged
clothes
and
pinched
faces
and
weak
hungry
cold
wet
and
dirty
with
no
hope
of
reward
or
rest
they
marched
cheerfully
to
meet
the
warmly
clad
and
hosts
of
the
enemy
soldier
life
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
indomitable
indeed
were
the
hearts
that
beat
beneath
the
grey
jackets
and
a
spirit
rising
superior
to
all
misfortune
that
ever
with
a
frolic
welcome
took
the
thunder
and
the
sunshine
was
a
marked
characteristic
of
the
confederate
soldier
nor
was
it
only
in
camp
or
on
the
march
that
the
temper
of
the
troops
betrayed
itself
in
reckless
gaiety
general
longstreet
relates
an
amusing
story
one
of
the
soldiers
during
the
investment
of
suffolk
april
carefully
constructed
and
equipped
a
man
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
improved
butternut
clothing
and
christening
him
julius
caesar
took
him
to
a
signal
platform
which
overlooked
the
works
adjusted
him
to
a
graceful
position
and
made
him
secure
to
the
framework
by
strong
cords
a
little
after
sunrise
julius
caesar
was
discovered
by
some
of
the
federal
battery
officers
who
prepared
for
the
target
so
inviting
to
skilful
practice
the
new
soldier
sat
under
the
hot
fire
with
irritating
indifference
until
the
confederates
unable
to
restrain
their
hilarity
exposed
the
joke
by
calling
for
three
cheers
for
julius
caesar
the
other
side
quickly
recognised
the
situation
and
added
to
ours
their
cheers
for
the
old
hero
from
manassas
to
apomattox
the
stress
of
battle
might
thin
their
ranks
but
it
was
powerless
to
check
their
laughter
the
dry
humour
of
the
american
found
a
fine
field
in
the
incidents
of
a
fierce
engagement
nothing
escaped
without
remark
the
excitement
of
a
general
the
accelerated
movements
of
the
the
vagaries
of
the
army
mule
the
bad
practice
of
the
artillery
all
afforded
entertainment
and
when
the
fight
became
hotter
and
the
federals
pressed
resolutely
to
the
attack
the
flow
of
badinage
took
a
grim
and
peculiar
turn
it
has
already
been
related
that
the
confederate
armies
depended
to
a
large
degree
for
their
clothing
and
equipments
on
what
they
captured
so
abundant
was
this
source
of
supply
that
the
soldier
had
come
to
look
upon
his
enemy
as
a
movable
magazine
of
creature
comforts
and
if
he
marched
cheerfully
to
battle
it
was
not
so
much
because
he
loved
fighting
but
that
he
hoped
to
renew
his
wardrobe
a
victory
was
much
but
the
spoils
of
victory
were
more
no
sooner
then
did
the
federals
arrive
within
close
range
than
the
wild
yells
of
the
southern
infantry
became
mingled
with
fierce
laughter
and
derisive
shouts
take

such
were
the
cries
like
the
howls
of
wolves
that
were
heard
along
jackson
lines
at
fredericksburg
during
the
truce
on
the
second
day
of
fredericksburg
says
captain
smith
a
tall
alabama
soldier
who
was
one
of
the
picked
up
a
new
enfield
rifle
on
the
neutral
ground
examined
it
tested
the
sights
shouldered
it
and
was
walking
back
to
the
confederate
lines
when
a
young
federal
officer
very
handsomely
dressed
and
mounted
peremptorily
ordered
him
to
throw
it
down
telling
him
he
had
no
right
to
take
it
the
soldier
with
the
rifle
on
his
shoulder
walked
very
deliberately
round
the
officer
scanning
him
from
head
to
foot
and
then
started
again
towards
our
lines
on
this
the
federal
lieutenant
drawing
his
little
sword
galloped
after
him
and
ordered
him
with
an
oath
to
throw
down
the
rifle
the
soldier
halted
then
walked
round
the
officer
once
again
very
slowly
looking
him
up
and
down
and
at
last
said
pointing
to
his
fine
boots
i
shall
shoot
you
tomorrow
and
get
them
boots
then
strode
away
to
his
command
the
lieutenant
made
no
attempt
to
follow
and
they
were
not
raised
in
mockery
the
was
the
soldier
harvest
and
as
the
sheaves
of
writhing
forms
under
the
muzzles
of
their
deadly
rifles
increased
in
length
and
depth
the
men
listened
with
straining
ears
for
the
word
to
charge
the
counterstroke
was
their
opportunity
the
rush
with
the
bayonet
was
never
so
speedy
but
that
deft
fingers
found
time
to
rifle
the
haversacks
of
the
fallen
and
such
was
the
eagerness
for
booty
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
troops
were
dragged
off
from
the
pursuit
it
is
said
that
at
fredericksburg
some
north
carolina
regiments
which
had
repulsed
and
followed
up
a
federal
brigade
were
hardly
to
be
restrained
from
dashing
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
reserves
and
when
at
length
they
were
turned
back
their
complaints
were
bitter
the
order
to
halt
and
retire
seemed
to
them
nothing
less
than
rank
injustice
with
disappointment
they
accused
their
generals
of
favouritism
they
do
want
the
north
to
git
anything
they
whined
they
would
hev
stopped
hood
texicans
they
let
them
go
on
but
if
they
relieved
their
own
pressing
wants
at
the
expense
of

and
consideration
as

none

defiantly
in

the
only
retort
of
the
dust
brown

was
a
volley
of
jests
not
always
unmixed
with
impudence
the
personal
attributes
of
their
fair
enemies

not
escape
observation
the
damsel
whose

were
of

hue
was
addressed
as
bricktop
until
she
screamed
with
rage
and
threatened
to
fire
into
the
ranks
while
the
maiden
of
sour
visage
and
uncertain
years
was
saluted
as
ole
miss
vinegar
by
a
whole
division
of
infantry
but
this
was
the
limit
of
the
resentment
at
the
same
time
when
in
the
midst
of
plenty
he
was
not
impeccable
for
highway
robbery
and
housebreaking
he
had
no
inclination
but
he
was
by
no

above
petty
larceny
pigs
and
poultry
fruit
corn
vegetables
and
he
looked
upon
as
his
lawful
perquisites
he
was
the
most
cunning
of
foragers
and
neither
stringent
orders
nor
armed
guards
availed
to
protect
a
field
of

or
a

was
only
equalled
when

was
caught

by
the
ingenuity
of
his

most
inoffensive

strange
pugnacity
and

were
used
against

it
was
solely
in

such
venial
faults
common
to
every
army
and
almost
justified
by
the
deficiencies
of
the
southern
commissariat
were
more
than
atoned
for
when

the

veterans
sufficient
has
been
said
their
deeds
speak
for
themselves
but
it
was
not
the
alone
that
bore
witness
to
their
fortitude
german
soldiers
have
told
us
that
in
the
war
of
when
their
armies
marching
on
paris
found
to
their
astonishment
the
great
city
strongly
garrisoned
and
hosts
gathering
in
every
quarter
for
its
relief
a
singular
apathy
took
possession
of
the
troops
the
explanation
offered
by
a
great
military
writer
is
that
after
a
certain
period
even
the
victor
becomes
tired
of
war
and
the
more
civilised
he
adds
a
people
is
the
more
quickly
will
this
weakness
become
apparent
the
conduct
of
war
von
der
goltz
whether
this
explanation
be
adequate
is
not
easy
to
decide
the
fact
remains
however
that
the
confederate
volunteer
was
able
to
overcome
that
longing
for
home
which
chilled
the
enthusiasm
of
the
german
conscript
and
this
is
the
more
remarkable
inasmuch
as
his
career
was
not
one
of
unchequered
victory
in
the
spring
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
more
numerous
than
ever
was
still
before
him
firmly
established
on
virginian
soil
hope
of
foreign
intervention
despite
the
assurances
of
the
politicians
was
gradually
fading
and
it
was
but
too
evident
that
the
war
was
far
from
over
yet
at
no
time
during
their
two
years
of
service
had
the
soldiers
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
that
discouragement
which
seized
the
germans
after
two
months
and
who
shall
dare
to
say
that
the
southerner
was
less
highly
civilised
than
the
prussian
or
the
bavarian
political
liberty
freedom
of
speech
and
action
are
the
real
elements
of
civilisation
and
not
merely
education
but
let
the
difference
in
the
constitution
of
the
two
armies
be
borne
in
mind
the
confederates
with
few
exceptions
were
volunteers
who
had
become
soldiers
of
their
own
choice
who
had
assumed
arms
deliberately
and
without
compulsion
and
who
by
their
own
votes
were
responsible
that
war
had
been
declared
the
germans
were
conscripts
a
dumb
powerless
irresponsible
multitude
animated
no
doubt
by
hereditary
hatred
of
the
enemy
but
without
that
sense
of
moral
obligation
which
exists
in
the
volunteer
we
may
be
permitted
then
to
believe
that
this
sense
of
moral
obligation
was
one
reason
why
the
spirit
of
the
southerners
rose
superior
to
human
weakness
and
that
the
old
adage
which
declares
that
one
volunteer
is
better
than
three
pressed
men
is
not
yet
out
of
date
nor
is
it
an
unfair
inference
that
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
allied
by
the
crimson
thread
of
kinship
to
those
of
wellington
of
raglan
and
of
clyde
owed
much
of
their
enduring
fortitude
to
the
rock
whence
they
were
hewn
and
yet
with
all
their
admirable
qualities
the
southern
soldiers
had
not
yet
got
rid
of
their
original
defects
temperate
obedient
and
small
as
was
the
percentage
of
bad
characters
and
habitual
misdoers
their
discipline
was
still
capable
of
improvement
the
assertion
at
first
sight
seems
a
contradiction
in
terms
how
could
troops
it
may
be
asked
who
so
seldom
infringed
the
regulations
be
other
than
for
the
simple
reason
that
discipline
in
quarters
is
an
absolutely
different
quality
from
discipline
in
battle
no
large
body
of
intelligent
men
assembled
in
a
just
cause
and
of
good
character
is
likely
to
break
out
into
excesses
or
if
obedience
is
manifestly
necessary
to
rebel
against
authority
subordination
to
the
law
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
all
civilised
society
but
such
subordination
however
praiseworthy
is
not
the
discipline
of
the
soldier
though
it
is
often
confounded
with
it
a
regiment
of
volunteers
billeted
in
some
country
town
would
probably
show
a
smaller
list
of
misdemeanours
than
a
regiment
of
regulars
yet
the
latter
might
be
exceedingly
and
the
former
have
no
real
discipline
whatever
for
that
is
the
discipline
of
the
volunteer
is
not
battle
discipline
the
discipline
of
the
cloth
of
habit
of
tradition
of
constant
association
and
of
mutual
confidence
excellent
in
itself
and
by
no
means
unknown
amongst
regular
soldiers
does
not
carry
with
it
a
mechanical
obedience
to
command
nor
does
it
merge
the
individual
in
the
mass
and
give
the
tremendous
power
of
unity
to
the
efforts
of
large
numbers
it
will
not
be
pretended
that
the
discipline
of
regular
troops
always
rises
superior
to
privation
and
defeat
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
number
of
deserters
from
wellington
army
in
spain
and
portugal
men
who
wilfully
absented
themselves
from
the
colours
and
wandered
over
the
country
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
while
the
behaviour
of
the
french
regulars
in
and
even
of
the
germans
when
they
rushed
back
in
panic
through
the
village
of
gravelotte
deaf
to
the
threats
and
entreaties
of
their
aged
sovereign
was
hardly
in
accordance
with
military
tradition
nevertheless
it
is
not
difficult
to
show
that
the
southerners
fell
somewhat
short
of
the
highest
standard
they
were
certainly
not
incapable
of
keeping
their
ranks
under
a
hot
fire
or
of
holding
their
ground
to
the
last
extremity
pickett
charge
at
gettysburg
is
one
of
the
most
splendid
examples
of
disciplined
valour
in
the
annals
of
war
and
the
endurance
of
lee
army
at
sharpsburg
has
seldom
been
surpassed
nor
was
the
disorder
into
which
the
attacking
lines
were
sooner
or
later
thrown
a
proof
of
inferior
training
even
in
the
days
of
muskets
the
admixture
of
not
only
companies
and
battalions
but
even
of
brigades
and
divisions
was
a
constant
feature
of
fierce
assaults
over
broken
ground
if
under
such
conditions
the
troops
still
press
forward
and
if
when
success
has
been
achieved
order
is
rapidly
restored
then
discipline
is
good
and
in
neither
respect
did
the
confederates
fail
but
to
be
proof
against
disorder
is
not
everything
in
battle
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
men
should
be
capable
of
fighting
fiercely
to
reap
the
full
benefit
of
their
weapons
and
their
training
they
must
be
obedient
to
command
the
rifle
is
a
far
less
formidable
weapon
when
every
man
uses
it
at
his
own
discretion
than
when
the
fire
of
a
large
body
of
troops
is
directed
by
a
single
will
precision
of
movement
too
is
necessary
for
the
quick
concentration
of
superior
forces
at
the
decisive
point
for
rapid
support
and
for
effective
combination
but
neither
was
the
fire
of
the
confederate
infantry
under
the
complete
control
of
their
officers
nor
were
their
movements
always
characterised
by
order
and
regularity
it
was
seldom
that
the
men
could
be
induced
to
refrain
from
answering
shot
with
shot
there
was
an
extraordinary
waste
of
ammunition
there
was
much
unnecessary
noise
and
the
regiments
were
very
apt
to
get
out
of
hand
it
is
needless
to
bring
forward
specific
proof
the
admissions
of
superior
officers
are
quite
sufficient
general
hill
in
an
interesting
description
of
the
southern
soldier
speaks
very
frankly
of
his
shortcomings
always
obedient
when
he
chose
to
be
impatient
of
drill
and
discipline
he
was
unsurpassed
as
a
scout
or
on
the
skirmish
line
of
the
courage
bred
of
drill
and
discipline
he
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
hence
on
the
he
was
more
of
a
free
lance
than
a
machine
who
ever
saw
a
confederate
line
advancing

was
not
crooked
as
a

ragged
rebel
yelling
on
his

hook
and
aligning
on
himself
but
there
is
as
much
need
of
the
soldier
as
of
the
soldier
and
the
concentrated
blow
is
always
the
most
effective
blow
the
erratic
effort
of
the
confederate
heroic
though
it
was
yet
failed
to
achieve
the
maximum
result
just
because
it
was
erratic
moreover
two
serious
evils
attended
that
excessive
egotism
and
individuality
which
came
to
the
confederate
through
his
training
association
and
habits
he
knew
when
a
movement
was
false
and
a
position
untenable
and
he
was
too
little
of
a
machine
to
give
in
such
cases
the
wholehearted
service
which
might
have
redeemed
the
blunder
the
other
evil
was
an
one
his
disregard
of
discipline
and
independence
of

a
straggler

straggling

and
fatal
the
experience
of

that
those

that
a

military
secretary

pages
that
such
a
circular
was
considered
necessary
after
the

had
been
nearly
four
years
under

establishes
beyond
all
question
that
the
discipline
of
the
confederate
army
was
not
that
of
the
regular
troops
with
whom
general
lee
had
served
under
the
stars

but
it
is
not
to
be
understood
that
he
attributed
the
deficiencies
of
his
soldiers
to
any
spirit
of
resistance
on
their
part
to
the
demands
of
subordination

the

find

in

here
with
his

perspicacity
he
goes
straight
to
the
root
of
the
evil
when
the
men
in
the
ranks
understand
all
that
discipline
involves
safety
health
efficiency
victory
it
is
easily
maintained
and
it
is
because
experience
and
tradition
have
taught
them
this
that
veteran

so
amenable
to
control
soldiers
says
sir
charles
napier
must
obey
in
all
things
they
may
and
do
laugh
at
foolish
orders
but
they
nevertheless
obey
not
because
they
are
blindly
obedient
but
because
they
know
that
to
disobey
is
to
break
the
backbone
of
their
profession
such
knowledge
however
is
long
in
coming
even
to
the
regular
and
it
may
be
questioned
whether
it
ever
really
came
home
to
the
confederates
in
fact
the
southern
soldier
ignorant
at
the
outset
of
what
may
be
accomplished
by
discipline
never
quite
got
rid
of
the
belief
that
the
enthusiasm
of
the
individual
his
goodwill
and
his
native
courage
was
a
more
than
sufficient
substitute
the
spirit
which
animates
our
soldiers
wrote

the
natural
courage
with
which
they

endowed

by

yet
the
soldier
was
hardly
to
blame
neither
he
nor
his
regimental
officers
had
any
previous
knowledge
of
war
when
they
were
suddenly
launched
against
the
enemy
and
there
was
no
time
to
instil
into
them
the
habits
of
discipline
there
was
no
regular
army
to
set
them
an
example
no
historic
force
whose
traditions
they
would
unconsciously
have
adopted
the
exigencies
of
the
service
forbade
the
retention
of
the
men
in
camps
of
instruction
and
trained
instructors
could
not
be
spared
from
more
important
duties
such
ignorance
however
as
that
which
prevailed
in
the
southern
ranks
is
not
always
excusable
it
would
be
well
if
those
who
pose
as
the
friends
of
the
private
soldier
as
his
protectors
from
injustice
realised
the
mischief
they
may
do
by
injudicious
sympathy
the
process
of
being
broken
to
discipline
is
undoubtedly
gaffing
to
the
instincts
of
free
men
and
it
is
beyond
question
that
among
a
multitude
of
superiors
some
will
be
found
who
are
neither
just
nor
considerate
instances
of
hardship
must
inevitably
occur
but
men
and
officers
for
discipline
presses
as
hardly
on
the
officers
as
on
the
men
must
obey
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
their
feelings
for
obedience
to
orders
instant
and
unhesitating
is
not
only
the
of
armies
but
the
security
of
states
and
the
doctrine
that
under
any
conditions
whatever
deliberate
disobedience
can
be
justified
is
treason
to
the
commonwealth
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
end
of
the
soldier
existence
is
not
merely
to
conduct
himself
as
a
respectable
citizen
and
earn
his
wages
but
to
face
peril
and
privations
not
of
his
own
free
will
but
at
the
bidding
of
others
and
in
circumstances
where
his
natural
instincts
assert
themselves
most
strongly
to
make
a
complete
surrender
of
mind
and
body
if
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
weighing
the
justice
or
the
wisdom
of
orders
before
obeying
them
if
he
has
been
taught
that
disobedience
may
be
a
pardonable
crime
he
will
probably
question
the
justice
of
the
order
that
apparently
sends
him
to
certain
death
if
he
once
begins
to
think
if
he
once
contemplates
the
possibility
of
disobedience
if
he
permits
a
single
idea
to
enter
his
head
beyond
the
necessity
of
instant
compliance
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
rise
superior
to
the
promptings
of
his
weaker
nature
men
must
be
habituated
to
obey
or
they
can
not
be
controlled
in
battle
and
the
slightest
interference
with
the
habit
of
subordination
is
fraught
therefore
with
the
very
greatest
danger
to
the
efficiency
of
an
army
it
has
been
asserted
and
it
would
appear
that
the
idea
is
widespread
that
patriotism
and
intelligence
are
of
vastly
more
importance
than
the
habit
of
obedience
and
it
was
certainly
a
very
general
opinion
in
america
before
the
war
this
idea
should
have
been
effectually
dissipated
at
all
events
in
the
north
by
the
battle
of
bull
run
nevertheless
throughout
the
conflict
a
predilection
existed
in
favour
of
what
was
called
the
thinking
bayonet
and
the
very
term
soldier
employed
by
general
hill
proves
that
the
strict
discipline
of
regular
armies
was
not
held
in
high
esteem
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
thinking
bayonet
is
by
no
means
to
be
decried
a
man
can
no
more
be
a
good
soldier
without
intelligence
and
aptitude
for
his
profession
than
he
can
be
a
successful
poacher
or
a
skilful
jockey
but
it
is
possible
in
considering
the
value
of
an
armed
force
to
rate
too
highly
the
natural
qualities
of
the
individual
in
the
ranks
in
certain
circumstances
especially
in
irregular
warfare
where
each
man
fights
for
his
own
hand
they
doubtless
play
a
conspicuous
part
a
thousand
skilled
riflemen
familiar
with
the
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
even
if
they
have
no
regular
training
and
are
incapable
of
precise
manoeuvres
may
prove
more
than
a
match
for
the
same
number
of
professional
soldiers
but
when
large
numbers
are
in
question
when
the
concentration
of
superior
force
at
a
single
point
and
the
close
of
the
three
arms
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
decide
the
issue
then
the
force
that
can
manoeuvre
that
moves
like
a
machine
at
the
mandate
of
a
single
will
has
a
marked
advantage
and
the
power
of
manoeuvring
and
of
combination
is
conferred
by
discipline
alone
two
mamelukes
said
napoleon
can
defeat
three
french
horsemen
because
they
are
better
armed
better
mounted
and
more
skilful
a
hundred
french
horse
have
nothing
to
fear
from
a
hundred
mamelukes
three
hundred
would
defeat
a
similar
number
and
a
thousand
french
would
defeat
fifteen
hundred
mamelukes
so
great
is
the
influence
of
tactics
order
and
the
power
of
manoeuvring
it
may
be
said
moreover
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
past
times
the
training
of
the
regular
soldier
neither
aims
at
producing
mere
machines
nor
has
it
that
effect
as
much
attention
is
given
to
the
development
of
in
the
rank
and
file
as
to
making
them
subordinate
it
has
long
been
recognised
that
there
are
many
occasions
in
war
when
even
the
private
must
use
his
wits
on
outpost
or
patrol
as
a
scout
an
orderly
or
when
his
immediate
superiors
have
fallen
momentous
issues
may
hang
on
his
judgment
and
initiative
and
in
a
good
army
these
qualities
are
sedulously
fostered
by
constant
instruction
in
field
duties
nor
is
the
fear
justified
that
the
strict
enforcement
of
exact
obedience
whenever
a
superior
is
present
impairs
under
this
system
of
training
the
capacity
for
independent
action
when
such
action
becomes
necessary
in
the
old
days
to
drill
and
discipline
the
soldier
into
a
machine
was
undoubtedly
the
end
of
all
his
training
his
officers
have
the
more
difficult
task
of
stimulating
his
intelligence
while
at
the
same
time
they
instil
the
habits
of
subordination
and
that
such
task
may
be
successfully
accomplished
we
have
practical
proof
the
regiments
of
the
light
brigade
trained
by
sir
john
moore
nearly
a
century
ago
on
the
system
of
proved
their
superiority
in
the
field
over
all
others
as
skirmishers
on
the
outpost
and
in
independent
fighting
they
were
exceedingly
efficient
and
yet
when
they
marched
shoulder
to
shoulder
no
troops
in
wellington
army
showed
a
more
solid
front
manoeuvred
with
greater
precision
or
were
more
completely
under
the
control
of
their
officers
mechanical
obedience
then
is
perfectly
compatible
with
the
freest
exercise
of
the
intelligence
provided
that
the
men
are
so
trained
that
they
know
instinctively
when
to
give
the
one
and
to
use
the
other
and
the
confederates
had
their
officers
and
officers
been
trained
soldiers
might
easily
have
acquired
this
highest
form
of
discipline
as
it
was
and
as
it
always
will
be
with
improvised
troops
the
discipline
of
battle
was
to
a
great
degree
purely
personal
the
men
followed
those
officers
whom
they
knew
and
in
whom
they
had
confidence
but
they
did
not
always
obey
simply
because
the
officer
had
the
right
to
command
and
they
were
not
easily
handled
when
the
wisdom
of
an
order
or
the
necessity
of
a
movement
was
not
apparent
the
only
way
it
was
said
by
an
englishman
in
the
confederacy
in
which
an
officer
could
acquire
influence
over
the
southern
soldiers
was
by
his
personal
conduct
under
fire
every
ounce
of
authority
was
his
expression
had
to
be
purchased
by
a
drop
of
my
blood
three
months
in
the
southern
states
general
sir
arthur
fremantle
such
being
the
case
it
is
manifest
that
jackson
methods
of
discipline
were
well
adapted
to
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
army
in
which
he
served
with
the
officers
he
was
exceedingly
strict
he
looked
to
them
to
set
an
example
of
unhesitating
obedience
and
the
precise
performance
of
duty
he
demanded
too
and
in
this
respect
his
own
conduct
was
a
model
that
the
rank
and
file
should
be
treated
with
tact
and
consideration
he
remembered
that
his
citizen
soldiers
were
utterly
unfamiliar
with
the
forms
and
customs
of
military
life
that
what
to
the
regular
would
be
a
mere
matter
of
course
might
seem
a
gross
outrage
to
the
man
who
had
never
acknowledged
a
superior
in
his
selection
of
officers
therefore
for
posts
upon
his
staff
and
in
his
recommendations
for
promotion
he
considered
personal
characteristics
rather
than
professional
ability
he
preferred
men
who
would
win
the
confidence
of
others
men
not
only
strong
but
possessing
warm
sympathies
and
broad
minds
to
mere
martinets
ruling
by
regulation
and
treating
the
soldier
as
a
machine
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
condone
misconduct
in
the
volunteers
never
was
there
a
more
striking
contrast
than
between
jackson
the
general
and
jackson
off
duty
during
his
sojourn
at
moss
neck
corbin
little
daughter
a
child
of
six
years
old
became
a
special
favourite
her
pretty
face
and
winsome
ways
were
so
charming
that
he
requested
her
mother
that
she
might
visit
him
every
afternoon
when
the
day
labours
were
over
he
had
always
some
little
treat
in
store
for
her
an
orange
or
an
apple
but
one
afternoon
he
found
that
his
supply
of
good
things
was
exhausted
glancing
round
the
room
he
eye
fell
on
a
new
uniform
cap
ornamented
with
a
gold
band
taking
his
knife
he
ripped
off
the
braid
and
fastened
it
among
the
curls
of
his
little
playfellow
a
little
later
the
child
was
taken
ill
and
after
his
removal
from
moss
neck
he
heard
that
she
had
died
the
general
writes
his
wept
freely
when
i
brought
him
the
sad
news
yet
in
the
administration
of
discipline
jackson
was
far
sterner
than
general
lee
or
indeed
than
any
other
of
the
generals
in
virginia
once
on
the
march
fearing
lest
his
men
might
stray
from
the
ranks
and
commit
acts
of
pillage
he
had
issued
an
order
that
the
soldiers
should
not
enter
private
dwellings
disregarding
the
order
a
soldier
entered
a
house
and
even
used
insulting
language
to
the
women
of
the
family
this
was
reported
to
jackson
who
had
the
man
arrested
tried
by
and
shot
in
twenty
minutes
bright
skies
and
dark
shadows
reverend
field
page
he
never
failed
to
confirm
the
sentences
of
death
passed
by
on
deserters
it
was
in
vain
that
his
oldest
friends
or
even
the
chaplains
appealed
for
a
mitigation
of
the
extreme
penalty
while
he
was
in
command
at
winchester
in
december
a
soldier
who
was
charged
with
striking
his
captain
was
tried
by
and
sentenced
to
be
shot
knowing
that
the
breach
of
discipline
had
been
attended
with
many
extenuating
circumstances
some
of
us
endeavoured
to
secure
his
pardon
possessing
ourselves
of
all
the
facts
we
waited
upon
the
general
who
evinced
the
deepest
interest
in
the
object
of
our
visit
and
listened
with
evident
sympathy
to
our
plea
there
was
moisture
in
his
eyes
when
we
repeated
the
poor
fellow
pitiful
appeal
that
he
be
allowed
to
die
for
his
country
as
a
soldier
on
the
field
of
battle
and
not
as
a
dog
by
the
muskets
of
his
own
comrades
such
solicitude
for
the
success
of
our
efforts
did
he
manifest
that
he
even
suggested
some
things
to
be
done
which
we
had
not
thought
of
at
the
same
time
he
warned
us
not
to
be
too
hopeful
he
said
it
is
unquestionably
a
case
of
great
hardship
but
a
pardon
at
this
juncture
might
work
greater
hardship
resistance
to
lawful
authority
is
a
grave
offence
in
a
soldier
to
pardon
this
man
would
be
to
encourage
insubordination
throughout
the
army
and
so
ruin
our
cause
still
he
added
i
will
review
the
whole
case
and
no
man
will
be
happier
than
myself
if
i
can
reach
the
same
conclusions
as
you
have
done
the
soldier
was
shot
communicated
by
the
reverend
dr
graham
on
another
occasion
four
men
were
to
be
executed
for
desertion
to
the
enemy
the
firing
party
had
been
ordered
to
parade
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
shortly
before
the
hour
a
chaplain
not
noted
for
his
tact
made
his
way
to
the
general
tent
and
petitioned
earnestly
that
the
prisoners
might
even
now
be
released
jackson
whom
he
found
pacing
backwards
and
forwards
in
evident
agitation
watch
in
hand
listened
courteously
to
his
arguments
but
made
no
reply
until
at
length
the
worthy
minister
in
his
most
impressive
manner
said
general
consider
your
responsibility
before
the
lord
you
are
sending
these
men
souls
to
hell
with
a
look
of
intense
disgust
at
such
empty
cant
jackson
made
one
stride
forward
took
the
astonished
divine
by
his
shoulders
and
saying
in
his
severest
tones
that
sir
is
my
business
do
you
do
yours
thrust
him
forcibly
from
the
tent
his
severity
as
regards
the
more
serious
offences
did
not
however
alienate
in
the
smallest
degree
the
confidence
and
affection
of
his
soldiers
they
had
full
faith
in
his
justice
they
were
well
aware
that
to
order
the
execution
of
some
unfortunate
wretch
gave
him
intense
pain
but
they
recognised
as
clearly
as
he
did
himself
that
it
was
sometimes
expedient
that
individuals
should
suffer
they
knew
that
not
all
men
nor
even
the
greater
part
are
heroes
and
that
if
the
worthless
element
had
once
reason
to
believe
that
they
might
escape
the
legitimate
consequences
of
their
crimes
desertion
and
insubordination
would
destroy
the
army
by
some
of
the
senior
officers
however
his
rigorous
ideas
of
discipline
were
less
favourably
considered
they
were
by
no
means
disposed
to
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
sentences
of
in
the
second
army
corps
were
almost
invariably
confirmed
but
they
objected
strongly
to
the
same
measure
which
they
meted
out
to
the
men
being
consistently
applied
to
themselves
they
could
not
be
brought
to
see
that
neglect
of
duty
however
trivial
on
the
part
of
a
colonel
or
brigadier
was
just
as
serious
a
fault
as
desertion
or
insubordination
on
the
part
of
the
men
and
the
conflict
of
opinion
in
certain
cases
had
unfortunate
results
to
those
whose
conduct
he
approved
he
was
more
than
considerate
general

who
was
under
him
as
a
cadet

as
follows
when
in

at
bunker
hill
after
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
where
the
gallant
branch
was
killed
i
as
colonel
commanding
the

was
directed
by

to
hold
my
command
in
readiness
with
three
days
rations
for

to
report
to

information
that

could
give
me
i
had
been
in
jackson
corps
since
the
battles
round
richmond
and
had
been
very
derelict
in
not
paying
my
respects
to
my
old
professor
as
i
rode
to
his
headquarters
i
wondered
if
he
would
recognise
me
i
certainly
expected
to
receive
his
orders
in
a
few
terse
sentences
and
to
be
promptly
dismissed
with
a
military
salute
he
knew
me
as
soon
as
i
entered
his
tent
though
we
had
not
met
for
years
he
rose
quickly
with
a
smile
on
his
face
took
my
hand
in
both
of
his
in
the
warmest
manner
expressed
his
pleasure
at
seeing

chided
me
for
not
having

tones
of
his
voice
his
familiarly
calling
me

whereas
it
had
always
been
lane
at
the

put
me
completely
at
my
ease
then
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
love
that
reserved
man
whom
i
had
always
honoured
and
respected
as
my
professor
and
whom
i
greatly
admired
as
my
general
after
a
very
pleasant
and
somewhat
protracted
conversation
he
ordered
me
to
move
at
once
and
as
rapidly
as
possible
to

tear
up
the
baltimore
and

and
put
myself
in
communication
with

would
cover
my
operations
while
we
were
there
general
jackson
sent
a
member
of
his
staff
to
see
how
we
were
progressing
that
night
i
received
orders
to
move
at

quickly
to

there
had
been

skirmishing

morning
when

reported
to

he
received
me
in
the
same
cordial
manner
complimented
me
on
the
thoroughness
of
my
work
told
me
that
he
had
recommended
me
for
promotion
to
take
permanent
charge
of

that
as
i
was
the
only
person
recommended
through
military
channels
i
would
be
appointed
in
spite
of
the
two
aspirants
who
were
trying
to
bring
political
influence
to
bear
in

in
their
behalf
when
i
rose
to
go
he
took
my

of
his
looked
me
steadily
in
the
face
and
in
the
words
and
tones
of
friendly
warmth

never

his

jackson
treatment
of

was
very
different
no

how
high

stayed
his
hand
and
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
his
disregard
of
consequences
was
not
too
absolutely
uncompromising
men
who
live
in
constant
dread
of
their
chief
anger
are
not
likely
to
render
loyal
and
efficient
service
and
the
least
friction
in
the
higher
ranks
is
felt
throughout
the
whole
command
when
the
troops
begin
taking
sides
and
unanimity
disappears
the
power
of
energetic
combination
at
once
deteriorates
that
jackson
was
perfectly
just
is
not
denied
the
misconduct
of
his
subordinates
was
sometimes
flagrant
but
it
may
well
be
questioned
whether
to
keep
officers
under
arrest
for
weeks
or
even
months
marching
without
their
swords
in
rear
of
the
column
was
wholly
wise
there
is
but
one
public
punishment
for
a
senior
officer
who
is
guilty
of
serious
misbehaviour
and
that
is
instant
dismissal
if
he
is
suffered
to
remain
in
the
army
his
presence
will
always
be
a
source
of
weakness
but
the
question
will
arise
is
it
possible
to
replace
him
if
he
is
trusted
by
his
men
they
will
resent
his
removal
and
give
but
halfhearted
support
to
his
successor
so
in
dealing
with
those
in
high
places
tact
and
consideration
are
essential
even
dabney
admits
that
in
this
respect
jackson
conduct
is
open
to
criticism
as
already
related
he
looked
on
the
blunders
of
his
officers
if
those
blunders
were
honest
and
due
simply
to
misconception
of
the
situation
with
a
tolerant
eye
he
knew
too
much
of
war
and
its
difficulties
to
expect
that
their
judgment
would
be
unerring
he
never
made
the
mistake
of
reprehending
the
man
who
had
done
his
best
to
succeed
and
contented
himself
with
pointing
out
quietly
and
courteously
how
failure
might
have
been
avoided
but
if
he
believed
says
his
chief
of
the
staff
that
his
subordinates
were
or
contumacious
he
became
a
stern
and
exacting
master
and
during
his
career
a
causeless
friction
was
produced
in
the
working
of
his
government
over
several
gallant
and
meritorious
officers
who
served
under
him
this
was
almost
the
sole
fault
of
his
military
character
that
by
this
jealousy
of
intentional
inefficiency
he
diminished
the
sympathy
between
himself
and
the
general
officers
next
his
person
by
whom
his
orders
were
to
be
executed
had
he
been
able
to
exercise
the
same
energetic
authority
through
the
medium
of
a
zealous
personal
affection
he
would
have
been
a
more
perfect
leader
of
armies
dabney
volume
pages
to
this
system
of
command
was
in
all
probability
the
outcome
of
deliberate
calculation
no
officer
placed
in
permanent
charge
of
a
considerable
force
least
of
all
a
man
who
never
acted
except
upon
reflection
and
who
had
a
wise
regard
for
human
nature
could
fail
to
lay
down
for
himself
certain
principles
of
conduct
towards
both
officers
and
men
it
may
be
then
that
jackson
considered
the
course
he
pursued
the
best
adapted
to
maintain
discipline
amongst
a
number
of
ambitious
young
generals
some
of
whom
had
been
senior
to
himself
in
the
old
service
and
all
of
whom
had
been
raised
suddenly
with
probably
some
disturbance
to
their
to
high
rank
it
is
to
be
remembered
too
that
during
the
campaigns
of
his
ability
was
only
by
degrees
made
clear
it
was
not
everyone
who
like
general
lee
discerned
the
great
qualities
of
the
silent
and
unassuming
instructor
of
cadets
and
other
leaders
of
more
dashing
exterior
with
a
reputation
for
brilliant
courage
may
well
have
doubted
whether
his
capacity
was
superior
to
their
own
such
soaring
spirits
possibly
needed
a
tight
hand
and
in
any
case
jackson
had
much
cause
for
irritation
with
wolfe
and
sherman
he
shared
the
distinguished
honour
of
being
considered
crazy
by
hundreds
of
mediocrities
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
have
been
ignorant
although
not
one
word
of
complaint
ever
passed
his
lips
how
grossly
he
was
misrepresented
how
he
was
caricatured
in
the
press
and
credited
with
the
most
extravagant
and
foolhardy
ideas
of
war
nor
did
his
subordinates
in
very
many
instances
give
him
that
loyal
and
ungrudging
support
which
he
conceived
was
the
due
of
the
commanding
general
more
than
one
of
his
enterprises
fell
short
of
the
full
measure
of
success
owing
to
the
shortcomings
of
others
and
these
shortcomings
such
as
loring
insubordination
at
romney
steuart
refusal
to
pursue
banks
after
winchester
retreat
at
kernstown
hill
tardiness
at
cedar
run
might
all
be
traced
to
the
same
cause
disdain
of
his
capacity
and
a
misconception
of
their
own
position
in
such
circumstances
it
is
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
if
his
wrath
blazed
to
a
white
heat
he
was
not
of
a
forgiving
nature
once
roused
resentment
took
possession
of
his
whole
being
and
it
may
be
questioned
whether
it
was
ever
really
appeased
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
jackson
lacked
the
fascination
which
allied
to
lofty
intellect
wins
the
hearts
of
men
most
readily
and
is
the
characteristic
of
the
very
greatest
warriors
can
hardly
be
denied
his
influence
with
men
was
a
plant
of
slow
growth
yet
the
glamour
of
his
great
deeds
the
gradual
recognition
of
his
unfailing
sympathy
his
modesty
and
his
truth
produced
in
the
end
the
same
result
as
the
personal
charm
of
napoleon
of
nelson
and
of
lee
his
hold
on
the
devotion
of
his
troops
was
very
sure
god
knows
said
his
weeping
the
tears
of
a
brave
man
i
would
have
died
for
him
and
few
commanders
have
been
followed
with
more
implicit
confidence
or
have
inspired
a
deeper
and
more
abiding
affection
long
years
after
the
war
a
bronze
statue
in
his
habit
as
he
lived
was
erected
on
his
grave
at
lexington
thither
when
the
figure
was
unveiled
came
the
survivors
of
the
second
army
corps
the
men
of
manassas
and
of
sharpsburg
of
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
and
of
many
another
field
and
the
younger
generation
looked
on
the
relics
of
an
army
whose
peer
the
world
has
seldom
seen
when
the
guns
had
fired
a
salute
the
wild
rebel
yell
the
music
which
the
great
virginian
had
loved
so
well
rang
loud
above
his
grave
and
as
the
last
reverberations
died
away
across
the
hill
the
ranks
stood
still
and
silent
see
how
they
loved
him
said
one
and
it
was
spoken
with
deepest
reverence
two
officers
who
had
served
under
jackson
were
sitting
near
each
other
on
their
horses
each
remarked
the
silence
of
the
other
and
each
saw
that
the
other
was
in
tears
i
not
ashamed
of
it
snowden
nor
i
old
boy
replied
the
other
as
he
tried
to
smile
when
after
the
unveiling
the
columns
marched
past
the
monument
the
old
fellows
looked
up
and
then
bowed
their
uncovered
heads
and
passed
on
but
one
tall
gaunt
soldier
of
the
stonewall
brigade
as
he
passed
out
of
the
cemetery
looked
back
for
a
moment
at
the
figure
of
his
general
and
waving
his
old
grey
hat
towards
it
cried
out
old
man
we
done
all
we
could
for
you
it
is
not
always
easy
to
discern
why
one
general
is
worshipped
even
by
men
who
have
never
seen
him
while
another
of
equal
or
even
superior
capacity
fails
to
awaken
the
least
spark
of
affection
except
in
his
chosen
friends
grant
was
undoubtedly
a
greater
soldier
than
mcclellan
and
the
genius
of
wellington
was
not
less
than
that
of
nelson
and
yet
while
nelson
and
mcclellan
won
all
hearts
not
one
single
private
had
either
for
wellington
or
grant
any
warmer
sentiment
than
respect
it
would
be
as
unfair
however
to
attribute
selfishness
or
want
of
sympathy
to
either
wellington
or
grant
as
to
insinuate
that
nelson
and
mcclellan
were
deliberate
bidders
for
popularity
it
may
be
that
in
the
two
former
the
very
strength
of
their
patriotism
was
at
fault
to
them
the
state
was
everything
the
individual
nothing
to
fight
for
their
country
was
merely
a
question
of
duty
into
which
the
idea
of
glory
or
recompense
hardly
entered
and
indifferent
themselves
either
to
praise
or
blame
they
considered
that
the
victory
of
the
national
arms
was
a
sufficient
reward
for
the
soldier
toils
both
were
generous
and
exerting
themselves
incessantly
to
provide
for
the
comfort
and
of
their
troops
neither
was
insensible
to
suffering
and
both
were
just
as
capable
of
as
either
nelson
or
mcclellan
but
the
standpoint
from
which
they
looked
at
war
was
too
exalted
nelson
and
mcclellan
on
the
other
hand
recognised
that
they
commanded
men
not
stoics
sharing
with
napoleon
the
rare
quality
of
captivating
others
a
quality
which
comes
by
nature
or
comes
not
at
all
they
made
allowance
for
human
nature
and
identified
themselves
with
those
beneath
them
in
the
closest
camaraderie
and
herein
to
a
great
extent
lay
the
secret
of
the
enthusiastic
devotion
which
they
inspired
if
the
pitiless
dissectors
of
character
are
right
we
ought
to
see
in
napoleon
the
most
selfish
of
tyrants
the
coldest
end
most
crafty
of
charlatans
it
is
difficult
however
to
believe
that
the
hearts
of
a
generation
of
hardy
warriors
were
conquered
merely
by
ringing
phrases
and
skilful
flattery
it
should
be
remembered
that
from
a
mercenary
force
degraded
and
despised
he
transformed
the
grand
army
into
the
terror
of
europe
and
the
pride
of
france
during
the
years
of
his
glory
when
the
legions
controlled
the
destinies
of
their
country
none
was
more
honoured
than
the
soldier
his
interests
were
always
the
first
to
be
considered
the
highest
ranks
in
the
peerage
the
highest
offices
of
state
were
held
by
men
who
had
carried
the
knapsack
and
when
thrones
were
going
begging
their
claims
were
preferred
before
all
others
the
emperor
with
all
his
greatness
was
always
the
little
corporal
to
his
grenadiers
his
career
was
their
own
as
they
shared
his
glory
so
they
shared
his
reward
every
upward
step
he
made
towards
supreme
power
he
took
them
with
him
and
their
relations
were
always
of
the
most
cordial
and
familiar
character
he
was
never
happier
than
when
on
the
eve
of
some
great
battle
he
made
his
bivouac
within
a
square
of
the
guard
never
more
at
ease
than
when
exchanging
rough
compliments
with
the
veterans
of
rivoli
or
jena
he
was
the
representative
of
the
army
rather
than
of
the
nation
the
men
knew
that
no
civilian
would
be
preferred
before
them
that
their
gallant
deeds
were
certain
of
his
recognition
that
their
claims
to
the
cross
to
pension
and
to
promotion
would
be
as
carefully
considered
as
the
claims
of
their
generals
they
loved
napoleon
and
they
trusted
him
and
whatever
may
have
been
his
faults
he
was
the
little
corporal
the
friend
and
comrade
of
his
soldiers
to
the
end
it
was
by
the
same
hooks
of
steel
that
stonewall
jackson
grappled
the
hearts
of
the
second
army
corps
to
his
own
his
men
loved
him
not
merely
because
he
was
the
bravest
man
they
had
ever
known
the
strongest
and
the
most
resolute
not
because
he
had
given
them
glory
and
had
made
them
heroes
whose
fame
was
known
beyond
the
confines
of
the
south
but
because
he
was
one
of
themselves
with
no
interests
apart
from
their
interests
because
he
raised
them
to
his
own
level
respecting
them
not
merely
as
soldiers
but
as
comrades
the
tried
comrades
of
many
a
hard
fight
and
weary
march
although
he
ruled
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
made
no
secret
either
officially
or
privately
of
his
deep
and
abiding
admiration
for
their
valour
his
very
dispatches
showed
that
he
regarded
his
own
skill
and
courage
as
small
indeed
when
compared
with
theirs
like
napoleon
his
congratulatory
orders
were
conspicuous
for
the
absence
of
all
reference
to
himself
it
was
always
we
not
i
and
he
was
among
the
first
to
recognise
the
worth
of
the
rank
and
file
one
day
says
mcguire
early
in
the
war
when
the
second
virginia
regiment
marched
by
i
said
to
general
johnston
if
these
men
will
not
fight
you
have
no
troops
that
will
he
expressed
the
prevalent
opinion
of
the
day
in
his
reply
saying
i
would
not
give
one
company
of
regulars
for
the
whole
regiment
when
i
returned
to
jackson
i
had
occasion
to
quote
general
johnston
opinion
did
he
say
that
he
asked
and
of
those
splendid
men
and
then
he
added
the
patriot
volunteer
fighting
for
his
country
and
his
rights
makes
the
most
reliable
soldier
upon
earth
and
his
veterans
knew
more
than
that
their
general
believed
them
to
be
heroes
they
knew
that
thia
great
valiant
man
beside
whom
all
others
save
lee
himself
seemed
small
and
feeble
this
mighty
captain
who
held
the
hosts
of
the
enemy
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
was
the
kindest
and
the
most
considerate
of
human
beings
to
them
he
was
old
jack
in
the
same
affectionate
sense
as
he
had
been
old
jack
to
his
at
west
point
they
followed
him
willingly
for
they
knew
that
the
path
he
trod
was
the
way
to
victory
but
they
loved
him
as
children
do
their
parents
because
they
were
his
first
thought
and
his
last
in
season
and
out
of
season
he
laboured
for
their
welfare
to
his
transport
and
commissariat
officers
he
was
a
hard
master
the
unfortunate
wight
who
had
neglected
to
bring
up
supplies
or
who
ventured
to
make
difficulties
discovered
to
his
cost
that
his
quiet
commander
could
be
very
terrible
but
those
officers
who
did
their
duty
in
whatever
branch
of
the
service
they
might
be
serving
found
that
their
zeal
was
more
than
appreciated
for
himself
he
asked
nothing
on
behalf
of
his
subordinates
he
was
a
constant
and
persistent
suitor
he
was
not
only
ready
to
support
the
claims
to
promotion
of
those
who
deserved
it
but
in
the
case
of
those
who
displayed
special
merit
he
took
the
initiative
himself
and
he
was
not
content
with
one
refusal
his
only
difference
with
general
lee
if
difference
it
can
be
called
was
on
a
question
of
this
nature
the
it
appears
soon
after
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
had
proposed
to
appoint
officers
to
the
second
army
corps
who
had
served
elsewhere
after
some
correspondence
jackson
wrote
as
follows
my
rule
has
been
to
recommend
such
as
were
in
my
opinion
best
qualified
for
filling
vacancies
the
application
of
this
rule
has
prevented
me
from
even
recommending
for
the
command
of
my
old
brigade
one
of
its
officers
because
i
did
not
regard
any
of
them
as
competent
as
another
of
whose
qualifications
i
had
a
higher
opinion
this
rule
has
led
me
to
recommend
colonel
bradley
johnson
for
the
command
of
taliaferro
brigade
i
desire
the
interest
of
the
service
and
no
other
interest
to
determine
who
shall
be
selected
to
fill
the
vacancies
guided
by
this
principle
i
can
not
go
outside
of
my
command
for
persons
to
fill
vacancies
in
it
unless
by
so
doing
a
more
competent
officer
is
secured
this
same
principle
leads
me
to
oppose
having
officers
who
have
never
served
with
me
and
of
whose
qualifications
i
have
no
knowledge
forced
upon
me
by
promoting
them
to
fill
vacancies
in
my
command
and
advancing
them
over
meritorious
officers
well
qualified
for
the
positions
and
of
whose
qualifications
i
have
had
ample
opportunities
of
judging
from
their
having
served
with
me
in
my
opinion
the
interest
of
the
service
would
be
injured
if
i
should
quietly
consent
to
see
officers
with
whose
qualifications
i
am
not
acquainted
promoted
into
my
command
to
fill
vacancies
regardless
of
the
merits
of
my
own
officers
who
are
well
qualified
for
the
positions
the
same
principle
leads
me
when
selections
have
to
be
made
outside
of
my
command
to
recommend
those
if
there
be
such
whose
former
service
with
me
proved
them
well
qualified
for
filling
the
vacancies
this
induced
me
to
recommend
captain
chew
who
does
not
belong
to
this
army
corps
but
whose
reputation
when
with
me
has
not
been
forgotten
and
as
he
studied
the
wishes
of
his
officers
working
quietly
and
persistently
for
their
advancement
so
he
studied
the
wishes
of
the
private
soldiers
it
is
well
known
that
artillerymen
come
after
a
time
to
feel
a
personal
affection
for
their
guns
especially
those
which
they

used

near

jackson
was
asked
to

which

general
your
letter
of
this
date
recommending
that
i
distribute
the
rifle
and
napoleon
guns
as
to
give
general
hill
a
fair
proportion
has
been
received
i
respectfully
request
if
any
such
distribution
is
to
be
made
that
you
will
direct
your
chief
of
artillery
or
some
other
officer
to
do
it
but
i
hope
that
none
of
the
guns
which
belonged
to
the
army
of
the
valley
before
it
became
part
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
after
the
battle
of
cedar
run
will
be
taken
from
it
if
since
that
time
any
artillery
has
improperly
come
into
my
command
i
trust
that
it
will
be
taken
away
and
the
person
in
whose
possession
it
may
be
found
punished
if
his
conduct
requires
it
so
careful
was
i
to
prevent
an
improper
distribution
of
the
artillery
and
other
public
property
captured
at
harper
ferry
that
i
issued
a
written
order
directing
my
staff
officers
to
turn
over
to
the
proper
chiefs
of

of
the
army
of
northern

all
captured
stores
a
copy
of
the
order
is
herewith
enclosed
general
hill
artillery
wants
existed
at
the
time
he
was
assigned
to
my
command
and
it
is
hoped
that
the
artillery
which
belonged
to
the
army
of
the
valley
will
not
be
taken
to
supply
his
wants
i
am
general
your
obedient
servant
jackson
no
further
correspondence
is
to
be
found
on
the
subject
so
it
may
be
presumed
that
the
protest
was
successful
jackson
relations
with
the
rank
and
file
have
already
been
referred
to
and
although
he
was
now
commander
of
an
army
corps
and
universally
acknowledged
as
one
of
the
foremost
generals
of
the
confederacy
his
rise
in
rank
and
reputation
had
brought
no
increase
of
dignity
he
still
treated
the
humblest
privates
with
the
same
courtesy
that
he
treated
the
he
never
repelled
their
advances
nor
refused
if
he
could
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
and
although
he
seldom
went
out
of
his
way
to
speak
to
them
if
any
soldier
addressed
him
especially
if
he
belonged
to
a
regiment
recruited
from
the
valley
he
seldom
omitted
to
make
some
inquiry
after
those
he
had
left
at
home
never
it
was
said
was
his
tone
more
gentle
or
his
smile
more
winning
than
when
he
was
speaking
to
some
ragged
representative
of
his
old
brigade
how
his
heart
went
out
to
them
may
be
inferred
from
the
following
writing
to
a
friend
at
richmond
he
said
though
i
have
been
relieved
from
command
in
the
valley
and
may
never
again
be
assigned
to
that
important
trust
yet
i
feel
deeply
when
i
see
the
patriotic
people
of
that
region
under
the
heel
of
a
hateful
military
despotism
there
are
all
the
hopes
of
those
who
have
been
with
me
from
the
commencement
of
the
war
in
virginia
who
have
repeatedly
left
their
homes
and
families
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
to
brave
the
dangers
of
battle
and
disease
and
there
are
those
who
have
so
devotedly
laboured
for
the
relief
of

jackson
employed
himself
in
preparing
the
reports
of
his
battles
which
had
been
called
for
by
the
they
were
not
compiled
in
their
entirety
by
his
own
hand
he
was
no
novice
at
literary
composition
and
his
pen
as
his
shows
was
not
that
of
an
unready
writer
he
had
a
good
command
of
language
and
that
power
of
clear
and
concise
expression
which
every
officer
in
command
of
a
large
force
a
position
naturally
entailing
a
large
amount
of
confidential
correspondence
must
necessarily
possess
but
the
task
now
set
him
was
one
of
no
ordinary
magnitude
since
the
battle
of
kernstown
the
report
of
which
had
been
furnished
in
april
the
time
had
been
too
fully
occupied
to
admit
of
the
crowded
events
being
placed
on
record
and
more
than
of
the
division
brigade
and
regimental
commanders
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
operations
of
the
period
had
been
killed
nor
even
now
did
his
duties
permit
him
the
necessary
leisure
to
complete
the
work
without
assistance
on
his
requisition
therefore
colonel
charles
faulkner
who
had
been
united

minister
to
france
before
the
war
was
attached
to
his
staff
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
the
reports
of
the
subordinate
commanders
and
combining
them
in
the
proper
form
the
rough
drafts
were
carefully
gone
over
by
the
general
every
sentence
was
weighed
and
everything
that
might
possibly
convey
a
wrong
impression
was
at
once
rejected
evidence
was
called
to
clear
up
disputed
points
no
inferences
or
suppositions
were
allowed
to
stand
truth
was
never
permitted
to
be
sacrificed
to
effect
superlatives
were
rigorously
excluded
the
report
of
sharpsburg
which
jackson
had
not
yet
revised
at
the
time
of
his
death
is
not
altogether
free
from
exaggeration
and
the
narratives
may
be
unquestionably
accepted
as
an
accurate
relation
of
the
facts
many
stirring
passages
were
added
by
the
general
own
pen
and
the
praise
bestowed
upon
the
troops
both
officers
and
men
is
couched
in
the
warmest
terms
yet
much
was
omitted
jackson
had
a
rooted
objection
to
represent
the
motives
of
his
actions
or
to
set
forth
the
object
of
his
movements
in
reply
to
a
remonstrance
that
those
who
came
after
him
would
be
embarrassed
by
the
absence
of
these
explanations
and
that
his
fame
would
suffer
he
said
the
men
who
come
after
me
must
act
for
themselves
and
as
to
the
historians
who
speak
of
the
movements
of
my
command
i
do
not
concern
myself
greatly
as
to
what
they
may
say
to
judge
then
from
the
reports
jackson
himself
had
very
little
to
do
with
his
success
indeed
were
they
the
only
evidence
available
it
would
be
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
the
more
brilliant
manoeuvres
were
ordered
by
himself
or
executed
on
the
initiative
of
others
but
in
this
he
was
perfectly
consistent
when
the
publisher
of
an
illustrated
periodical
wrote
to
him
asking
him
for
his
portrait
and
some
notes
of
his
battles
as
the
basis
of
a
sketch
he
replied
that
he
had
no
likeness
of
himself
and
had
done
nothing
worthy
of
mention
it
is
not
without
interest
in
this
connection
to
note
that
the
old
testament
supplied
him
with
a
pattern
for
his
reports
just
as
it
supplied
him
as
he
often
declared
with
precepts
and
principles
applicable
to
every
military
emergency
after
he
was
wounded
enlarging
one
morning
on
his
favourite
topic
of
practical
religion
he
turned
to
the
staff
officer
in
attendance
lieutenant
smith
and
asked
him
with
a
smile
can
you
tell
me
where
the
bible
gives
generals
a
model
for
their
official
reports
of
battles
the
answered
laughing
that
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
think
of
looking
for
such
a
thing
in
the
scriptures
nevertheless
said
the
general
there
are
such
and
excellent
models
too
look
for
instance
at
the
narrative
of

the

you
have

it

unbounded

had
been

him
to
a
man
of
his
extreme
domesticity
and
love
for
children
says
his
wife
this
was
a
crowning
happiness
and
yet
with
his
great
modesty
and
shrinking
from
publicity
he
requested
that
he
should
not
receive
the
announcement
by

when
it
came
to

himself

around
him

hear
of
it
from

was
to
him
a
joy
with
which
a
stranger
could
not
intermeddle

from
which
even
his
own
hand
could
not
lift
the
veil
of
sanctity
his
letters
were
full
of
longing
to
see
his
little
julia
for
by
this
name
which
had
been
his
mother
he
had
desired
her
to
be
christened
saying
my
mother
was
mindful
of
me
when
i
was
a
helpless
fatherless
child
and
i
wish
to
commemorate
her
now
how
thankful
i
am
he
wrote
to
our
kind
heavenly
father
for
having
spared
my
precious
wife
and
given
us
a
little
daughter
i
can
not
tell
how
gratified
i
am
nor
how
much
i
wish
i
could
be
with
you
and
see
my
two
darlings
but
while
this
pleasure
is
denied
me
i
am
thankful
it
is
accorded
to
you
to
have
the
little
pet
and
i
hope
it
may
be
a
great
deal
of
company
and
comfort
to
its
mother
now
do
exert
yourself
to
write
to
me
for
to
know
that
you
were
exerting
yourself
to
write
would
give
me
more
pain
than
the
letter
would
pleasure
so
you
must
not
do
it
but
you
must
love
your
esposo
in
the
mean
time
i
expect
you
are
just
now
made
up
with
that
baby
do
you
wish
your
husband
would
claim
any
part
of
it
but
let
you
have
the
sole
ownership
do
you
regard
it
as
the
most
precious
little
creature
in
the
world
do
not
spoil
it
and
do
let
anybody
tease
it
do
permit
it
to
have
a
bad
temper
how
i
would
love
to
see
the
darling
little
thing
give
her
many
kisses
from
her
father
at
present
i
am
fifty
miles
from
richmond
and
eight
miles
from
guiney
station
on
the
railroad
from
richmond
to
fredericksburg
should
i
remain
here
i
do
hope
you
and
baby
can
come
to
see
me
before
spring
as
you
can
come
on
the
railway
wherever
i
go
god
gives
me
kind
friends
the
people
here
show
me
great
kindness
i
receive
invitation
after
invitation
to
dine
out
and
spend
the
night
and
a
great
many
provisions
are
sent
me
including
cakes
tea
and
the
socks
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
still
come
i
am
so
thankful
to
our
heavenly
father
for
having
so
improved
my
eyes
as
to
enable
me
to
write
at
night
he
continually
showers
blessings
upon
me
and
that
you
should
have
been
spared
and
our
darling
little
daughter
given
us
fills
my
heart
with
overflowing
gratitude
if
i
know
my
unworthy
self
my
desire
is
to
live
entirely
and
unreservedly
to
god
glory
pray
my
darling
that
i
may
so
live
again
to
his
i
trust
god
will
answer
the
prayers
offered
for
peace
not
much
comfort
is
to
be
expected
until
this
cruel
war
terminates
i
have
seen
my
wife
since
last
march
and
never
having
seen
my
child
you
can
imagine
with
what
interest
i
look
to
north
carolina
but
the
tender
promptings
of
his
deep
natural
affection
were
stilled
by
his
profound
faith
that
duty
is
ours
consequences
are
god
the
confederate
army
at
this
time
as
at
all
others
suffered
terribly
from
desertion
and
one
of
his
own
brigades
reported
officers
and
men
absent
without
leave
last
evening
he
wrote
to
his
wife
on
christmas
day
i
received
a
letter
from
dabney
saying
one
of
the
highest
gratifications
both
dabney
and
i
could
enjoy
would
be
another
visit
from
jackson
and
he
invites
me
to
meet
you
there
he
and
dabney
are
very
kind
but
it
appears
to
me
that
it
is
better
for
me
to
remain
with
my
command
so
long
as
the
war
continues
if
all
our
troops
officers
and
men
were
at
their
posts
we
might
through
blessing
expect
a
more
speedy
termination
of
the
war
the
temporal
affairs
of
some
are
so
deranged
as
to
make
a
strong
plea
for
their
returning
home
for
a
short
time
but
our
god
has
greatly
blessed
me
and
mine
during
my
absence
and
whilst
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
see
you
and
our
darling
little
daughter
and
others
in
whom
i
take
a
special
interest
yet
duty
appears
to
require
me
to
remain
with
my
command
it
is
important
that
those
at
headquarters
set
an
example
by
remaining
at
the
post
of
duty
so
business
at
headquarters
went
on
in
its
accustomed
course
there
were
inspections
to
be
made
the
deficiencies
of
equipment
to
be
made
good
correspondence
to
be
conducted
and
the
control
of
men
demanded
much
the
enemy
to
be
watched
information
to
be
sifted
topographical
data
to
be
collected
and
the
reports
of
the
battles
to
be
written
every
morning
as
was
his
invariable
habit
during
a
campaign
the
general
had
an
interview
with
the
chiefs
of
the
commissariat
transport
ordnance
and
medical
departments
and
he
spent
many
hours
in
consultation
with
his
topographical
engineer
the
great
purpose
for
which
virginia
stood
in
arms
was
ever
present
to
his
mind
and
despite
his
reticence
his
staff
knew
that
he
was
occupied
day
and
night
with
the
problems
that
the
future
might
unfold
existence
at
headquarters
to
the
young
and
officers
who
formed
the
military
family
was
not
altogether
lively
outside
there
was
abundance
of
gaiety
the
confederate
army
even
on
those
lonely
hills
managed
to
extract
enjoyment
from
its
surroundings
the
hospitality
of
the
plantations
was
open
to
the
officers
and
wherever
stuart
and
his
brigadiers
pitched
their
tents
dances
and
music
were
the
order
of
the
day
nor
were
the
men
behindhand
even
the
heavy
snow
afforded
them
entertainment
whenever
a
thaw
took
place
they
set
themselves
to
making
and
great
battles
in
which
one
division
was
arrayed
against
another
and
which
were
carried
through
with
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
war
colours
flying
bugles
sounding
and
long
lines
charging
elaborately
planned
intrenchments
were
a
constant
source
of
amusement
except
to
unpopular
officers
theatrical
and
musical
performances
enlivened
the
tedium
of
the
long
evenings
and
when
by
the
glare
of
the
the
band
of
the
virginia
broke
into
the
rattling
of
dixie
land
not
the
least
stirring
of
national
anthems
and
the
great
concourse
of
took
up
the
chorus
closing
it
with
a
yell
that
shivered
to
the
tingling
stars
the
confederate
soldier
would
not
have
changed
places
with
the
president
himself
there
was
much
social
intercourse
too
between
the
different
headquarters
general
lee
was
no
unfrequent
visitor
to
moss
neck
and
on
christmas
day
jackson
provided
a
sumptuous
entertainment
at
which
turkeys
and
oysters
figured
for
the
and
the
senior
generals
stuart
too
often
invaded
the
quarters
of
his
old
comrade
and
jackson
looked
forward
to
the
merriment
that
was
certain
to
result
just
as
much
as
the
youngest
of
his
staff
stuart
exuberant
cheerfulness
and
humour
says
dabney
seemed
to
be
the
happy
relief
as
they
were
the
opposites
to
jackson
serious
and
diffident
temper
while
stuart
poured
out
his
and
cranks
not
seldom
at
jackson
expense
the
latter
sat
by
sometimes
unprepared
with
any
repartee
sometimes
blushing
but
always
enjoying
the
jest
with
a
quiet
and
merry
laugh
the
ornaments
on
the
wall
of
the
general
quarters
gave
stuart
many
a
topic
of
badinage
affecting
to
believe
that
they
were
of
general
jackson
selection
he
pointed
now
to
the
portrait
of
some
famous
and
now
to
the
print
of
some
celebrated
as
queer
revelations
of
his
private
tastes
indicating
a
great
decline
in
his
moral
character
which
would
be
a
grief
and
disappointment
to
the
pious
old
ladies
of
the
south
jackson
with
a
quiet
smile
replied
that
perhaps
he
had
had
more
to
do
with
than
his
friends
suspected
it
was
in
the
midst
of
such
a
scene
as
this
that
dinner
was
announced
and
the
two
generals
passed
to
the
it
so
happened
that
jackson
had
just
received
as
a
present
from
a
patriotic
lady
some
butter
upon
the
adornment
of
which
the
fair
donor
had
exhausted
her
housewife
skill
the
servants
in
honour
of
general
stuart
presence
had
chosen
this
to
grace
the
centre
of
the
board
as
his
eye
fell
upon
it
he
paused
and
with
mock
gravity
pointed
to
it
saying
there
gentlemen
if
that
is
not
the
crowning
evidence
of
our
host
sporting
tastes
he
even
has
his
favourite
stamped
on
his
butter
the
dinner
of
course
began
with
great
laughter
in
which
jackson
joined
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
any
visitors
too
from
europe
attracted
by
the
fame
of
the
army
and
its
leaders
had
made
their
way
into
the
confederate
lines
and
were
received
with
all
the
hospitality
that
the
camps
afforded
an
english
officer
has
recorded
his
experiences
at
moss
neck
i
brought
from
nassau
a
box
of
goods
a
present
from
england
for
general
stonewall
jackson
and
he
asked
me
when
i
was
at
richmond
to
come
to
his
camp
and
see
him
he
left
the
city
one
morning
about
seven
and
about
ten
landed
at
a
station
distant
some
eight
or
nine
miles
from
jackson
or
as
his
men
called
him
old
jack
camp
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
had
covered
the
country
for
some
time
before
to
the
depth
of
a
foot
and
formed
a
crust
over
the
virginian
mud
which
is
quite
as
villainous
as
that
of
balaclava
the
day
before
had
been
mild
and
wet
and
my
journey
was
made
in
a
drenching
shower
which
soon
cleared
away
the
white
mantle
of
snow
you
can
not
imagine
the
slough
of
despond
i
had
to
pass
through
wet
to
the
skin
i
stumbled
through
mud
i
waded
through
creeks
i
passed
through
and
at
last
got
into
camp
about
two
i
then
made
my
way
to
a
small
house
occupied
by
the
general
as
his
headquarters
i
wrote
down
my
name
and
gave
it
to
the
orderly
and
i
was
immediately
told
to
walk
in
the
general
rose
and
greeted
me
warmly
i
expected
to
see
an
old
untidy
man
and
was
most
agreeably
surprised
and
pleased
with
his
appearance
he
is
tall
handsome
and
powerfully
built
but
thin
he
has
brown
hair
and
a
brown
beard
his
mouth
expresses
great
determination
the
lips
are
thin
and
compressed
firmly
together
his
eyes
are
blue
and
dark
with
keen
and
searching
expression
i
was
told
that
his
age
was
and
he
looks
forty
the
general
who
is
indescribably
simple
and
unaffected
in
all
his
ways
took
off
my
wet
overcoat
with
his
own
hands
made
up
the
fire
brought
wood
for
me
to
put
my
feet
on
to
keep
them
warm
while
my
boots
were
drying
and
then
began
to
ask
me
questions
on
various
subjects
at
the
dinner
hour
we
went
out
and
joined
the
members
of
his
staff
at
this
meal
the
general
said
grace
in
a
fervent
quiet
manner
which
struck
me
very
much
after
dinner
i
returned
to
his
room
and
he
again
talked
for
a
long
time
the
servant
came
in
and
took
his
mattress
out
of
a
cupboard
and
laid
it
on
the
floor
as
i
rose
to
retire
the
general
said
captain
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
my
bed
i
hope
you
will
share
it
with
me
i
thanked
him
very
much
for
his
courtesy
but
said
and
slept
in
a
tent
sharing
the
blankets
of
one
of
his
in
the
morning
at
i
noticed
that
the
general
said
grace
before
the
meal
with
the
same
fervour
i
had
remarked
before
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
it
was
time
for
me
to
return
to
the
station
on
this
occasion
however
i
had
a
horse
and
i
returned
to
the
headquarters
to
bid
him
adieu
his
little
room
was
vacant
so
i
slipped
in
and
stood
before
the
fire
i
then
noticed
my
greatcoat
stretched
before
it
on
a
chair
shortly
afterwards
the
general
entered
the
room
he
said
captain
i
have
been
trying
to
dry
your
greatcoat
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
succeeded
very
well
that
little
act
illustrates
the
man
character
with
the
care
and
responsibilities
of
a
vast
army
on
his
shoulders
he
finds
time
to
do
little
acts
of
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
with
each
of
his
staff
officers
he
was
on
most
friendly
terms
and
the
visitors
to
his
camp
such
as
the
english
officer
quoted
above
found
him
a
most
delightful
host
discussing
with
the
ease
of
an
educated
gentleman
all
manner
of
topics
and
displaying
not
the
slightest
trace
of
that
awkwardness
and
extreme
diffidence
which
have
been
attributed
to
him
the
range
and
accuracy
of
his
information
surprised
them
of
military
history
said
another
english
soldier
he
knew
more
than
any
other
man
i
met
in
america
and
he
was
so
far
from
displaying
the
somewhat
grim
characteristics
that
have
been
associated
with
his
name
that
one
would
have
thought
his
tastes
lay
in
the
direction
of
art
and
literature
his
chief
delight
wrote
the
hon
francis
lawley
who
knew
him
well
was
in
the
cathedrals
of
england
notably
in
york
minster
and
westminster
abbey
he
was
never
tired
of
talking
about
them
or
listening
to
details
about
the
chapels
and
cloisters
of
oxford
the
times
june
general
jackson
writes
lord
wolseley
had
certainly
very
little
to
say
about
military
operations
although
he
was
intensely
proud
of
his
soldiers
and
enthusiastic
in
his
devotion
to
general
lee
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
talk
of
his
own
achievements
nor
can
i
say
that
his
speech
betrayed
his
intellectual
powers
but
his
manner
which
was
modesty
itself
was
most
attractive
he
put
you
at
your
ease
at
once
listening
with
marked
courtesy
and
attention
to
whatever
you
might
say
and
when
the
subject
of
conversation
was
congenial
he
was
a
most
interesting
companion
i
quite
endorse
the
statement
as
to
his
love
for
beautiful
things
he
told
me
that
in
all
his
travels
he
had
seen
nothing
so
beautiful
as
the
lancet
windows
in
york
minster
in
his
daily
intercourse
with
his
staff
however
in
his
office
or
in
the
he
showed
to
less
advantage
than
in
the
society
of
strangers
his
gravity
of
demeanour
seldom
wholly
disappeared
his
intense
earnestness
was
in
itself
oppressive
and
he
was
often
absent
and
preoccupied
life
at
headquarters
says
one
of
his
staff
officers
was
decidedly
dull
our
meals
were
often
very
dreary
the
general
had
no
time
for
light
or
trivial
conversation
and
he
sometimes
felt
it
his
duty
to
rebuke
our
thoughtless
and
perhaps
foolish
remarks
nor
was
it
always
quite
safe
to
approach
him
sometimes
he
had
a
tired
look
in
his
eyes
and
although
he
never
breathed
a
word
to
one
or
another
we
knew
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
what
was
being
done
with
the
army
letter
from
hunter
mcguire
intense
concentration
of
thought
and
purpose
in
itself
an
indication
of
a
powerful
will
had
distinguished
jackson
from
his
very
boyhood
during
his
campaigns
he
would
pace
for
hours
outside
his
tent
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
absorbed
in
meditation
and
when
the
army
was
on
the
march
he
would
ride
for
hours
without
raising
his
eyes
or
opening
his
lips
it
was
unquestionably
at
such
moments
that
he
was
working
out
his
plans
step
by
step
forecasting
the
of
the
enemy
and
providing
for
every
emergency
that
might
occur
and
here
the
habit
of
keeping
his
whole
faculties
fixed
on
a
single
object
and
of
imprinting
on
his
memory
the
successive
processes
of
complicated
problems
fostered
by
the
methods
of
study
which
both
at
west
point
and
lexington
the
weakness
of
his
eyes
had
made
compulsory
must
have
been
an
inestimable
advantage
brilliant
strategical
manoeuvres
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
are
not
a
matter
of
inspiration
and
of
decision
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
problems
presented
by
a
theatre
of
war
with
their
many
factors
are
not
to
be
solved
except
by
a
vigorous
and
sustained
intellectual
effort
if
said
napoleon
i
always
appear
prepared
it
is
because
before
entering
on
an
undertaking
i
have
meditated
for
long
and
have
foreseen
what
may
occur
it
is
not
genius
which
reveals
to
me
suddenly
and
secretly
what
i
should
do
in
circumstances
unexpected
by
others
it
is
thought
and
meditation
the
proper
objective
speaking
in
general
terms
of
all
military
operations
is
the
main
army
of
the
enemy
for
a
campaign
can
never
be
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
until
the
hostile
forces
in
the
field
have
become
demoralised
by
defeat
but
to
ensure
success
preponderance
of
numbers
is
usually
essential
and
it
may
be
said
therefore
that
the
proper
objective
is
the
enemy
main
army
when
it
is
in
inferior
strength
under
ordinary
conditions
the
first
step
then
towards
victory
must
be
a
movement
or
a
series
of
movements
which
will
compel
the
enemy
to
divide
his
forces
and
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
assemble
even
equal
strength
on
the
this
entails
a
consideration
of
the
strategic
points
upon
the
theatre
of
war
for
it
is
by
occupying
or
threatening
some
point
which
the
enemy
can
not
afford
to
lose
that
he
will
be
induced
to
disperse
his
army
or
to
place
himself
in
a
position
where
he
can
be
attacked
at
a
disadvantage
while
his
main
army
therefore
is
the
ultimate
objective
certain
strategic
points
become
the
initial
objectives
to
be
occupied
or
threatened
either
by
the
main
body
or
detached
forces
it
is
seldom
however
that
these
initial
objectives
are
readily
discovered
and
it
is
very
often
the
case
that
even
the
ultimate
objective
may
be
obscured
these
principles
are
well
illustrated
by
the
operations
in
the
valley
of
virginia
during
the
month
of
may
and
the
first
fortnight
of
june
after
the
event
it
is
easy
to
see
that
banks
army
was
jackson
proper
objective
being
the
principal
force
in
the
secondary
theatre
of
war
but
at
the
time
before
the
event
lee
and
jackson
alone
realised
the
importance
of
overwhelming
banks
and
thus
threatening
washington
it
was
not
realised
by
johnston
a
most
able
soldier
for
the
whole
of
his
correspondence
goes
to
show
that
he
thought
a
purely
defensive
attitude
the
best
policy
for
the
valley
army
it
was
not
realised
by
jackson
subordinates
for
it
was
not
till
long
after
the
battle
of
winchester
that
the
real
purport
of
the
operations
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
began
to
dawn
on
them
it
was
not
realised
by
lincoln
by
stanton
or
even
by
mcclellan
for
to
each
of
them
the
sudden
attack
on
front
royal
was
as
much
of
a
surprise
as
to
banks
himself
and
we
may
be
perfectly
confident
that
none
but
a
trained
strategist
after
a
prolonged
study
of
the
map
and
the
situation
would
realise
it
now
it
is
to
be
noted
too
that
jackson
initial
objectives
the
strategical
points
in
the
valley
were
invariably
well
selected
the
luray
gap
the
single
road
which
gives
access
across
the
massanuttons
from
one
side
of
the
valley
to
the
other
was
the
most
important
the
flank
position
on
elk
run
the
occupation
of
which
so
suddenly
brought
up
banks
prevented
him
interposing
between
jackson
and
edward
johnson
and
saved
staunton
from
capture
was
a
second
front
royal
by
seizing
which
he
threatened
banks
at
strasburg
in
flank
and
rear
compelling
him
to
a
hasty
retreat
and
bringing
him
to
battle
on
ground
which
he
had
not
prepared
a
third
and
the
position
at
port
republic
controlling
the
only
bridge
across
the
shenandoah
and
separating
shields
from
frémont
a
fourth
the
bearing
of
all
these
localities
was
overlooked
by
the
federals
and
throughout
the
campaign
we
can
not
fail
to
notice
a
great
confusion
on
their
part
as
regards
objectives
they
neither
recognised
what
the
aim
of
their
enemy
would
be
nor
at
what
they
should
aim
themselves
it
was
long
before
they
discovered
that
lee
army
and
not
richmond
was
the
vital
point
of
the
confederacy
not
a
single
attempt
was
made
to
seize
strategic
points
and
if
we
may
judge
from
the
orders
and
dispatches
in
the
official
records
their
existence
was
never
recognised
to
this
oversight
the
successive
defeats
of
the
northern
forces
were
in
great
part
due
from
mcclellan
to
banks
each
one
of
their
generals
appears
to
have
been
blind
to
the
advantages
that
may
be
derived
from
a
study
of
the
theatre
of
war
not
one
of
them
hit
upon
a
line
of
operations
which
embarrassed
the
confederates
and
all
possessed
the
unhappy
knack
of
joining
battle
on
the
most
unfavourable
terms
moreover
when
it
at
last
became
clear
that
the
surest
means
of
conquering
a
country
is
to
defeat
its
armies
the
true
objective
was
but
vaguely
realised
the
annihilation
of
the
enemy
troops
seems
to
have
been
the
last
thing
dreamt
of
opportunities
of
crushing
him
in
detail
were
neither
sought
for
nor
created
as
general
sheridan
said
afterwards
the
trouble
with
the
commanders
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
that
they
never
marched
out
to
lick
anybody
all
they
thought
of
was
to
escape
being
licked
themselves
but
it
is
not
sufficient
in
planning
strategical
combinations
to
arrive
at
a
correct
conclusion
as
regards
the
objective
success
demands
a
most
careful
calculation
of
ways
and
means
of
the
numbers
at
disposal
of
food
forage
and
ammunition
and
of
the
forces
to
he
detached
for
secondary
purposes
the
different
factors
of
the
problem
the
strength
and
dispositions
of
the
enemy
the
roads
railways
fortresses
weather
natural
features
the
morale
of
the
opposing
armies
the
character
of
the
opposing
general
the
facilities
for
supply
have
each
and
all
of
them
to
be
considered
their
relative
prominence
assigned
to
them
and
their
conflicting
claims
to
be
brought
into
adjustment
for
such
mental
exertion
jackson
was
well
equipped
he
had
made
his
own
the
experience
of
others
his
knowledge
of
history
made
him
familiar
with
the
principles
which
had
guided
washington
and
napoleon
in
the
selection
of
objectives
and
with
the
means
by
which
they
attained
them
it
is
not
always
easy
to
determine
the
benefit
beyond
a
theoretical
acquaintance
with
the
phenomena
of
the
to
be
derived
from
studying
the
campaigns
of
the
great
masters
of
war
it
is
true
that
no
successful
general
whatever
may
have
been
his
practical
knowledge
has
neglected
such
study
but
while
many
have
borne
witness
to
its
efficacy
none
have
left
a
record
of
the
manner
in
which
their
knowledge
of
former
campaigns
influenced
their
own
conduct
in
the
case
of
stonewall
jackson
however
we
have
much
evidence
indirect
but
unimpeachable
as
to
the
value
to
a
commander
of
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
the
maxims
of
napoleon
carried
in
his
haversack
were
constantly
consulted
throughout
his
campaigns
and
this
little
volume
contains
a
fairly
complete
exposition
in
napoleon
own
words
of
the
grand
principles
of
war
moreover
jackson
often
quoted
principles
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
maxims
but
on
which
napoleon
consistently
acted
it
is
clear
therefore
that
he
had
studied
the
campaigns
of
the
great
corsican
in
order
to
discover
the
principles
on
which
military
success
is
based
that
having
studied
and
reflected
on
those
principles
and
the
effect
their
application
produced
in
numerous
concrete
cases
they
became
so
firmly
imbedded
in
his
mind
as
to
be
ever
present
guiding
him
into
the
right
path
or
warning
him
against
the
wrong
whenever
he
had
to
deal
with
a
strategic
or
tactical
situation
it
may
be
noted
moreover
that
these
principles
especially
those
which
he
was
accustomed
to
quote
were
concerned
far
more
with
the
moral
aspect
of
war
than
with
the
material
it
is
a
fair
inference
therefore
that
it
was
to
the
study
of
human
nature
as
affected
by
the
conditions
of
war
by
discipline
by
fear
by
the
want
of
food
by
want
of
information
by
want
of
confidence
by
the
weight
of
responsibility
by
political
interests
and
above
all
by
surprise
that
his
attention
was
principally
directed
he
found
in
the
campaigns
of
jena
and
of
austerlitz
not
merely
a
record
of
marches
and
manoeuvres
of
the
use
of
intrenchments
or
of
the
general
rules
for
attack
and
defence
this
is
the
mechanical
and
elementary
part
of
the
science
of
command
what
jackson
learned
was
the
truth
of
the
famous
maxim
that
the
moral
is
to
the
physical
that
is
to
armament
and
numbers
as
three
to
one
he
learned
too
to
put
himself
into
his
adversary
place
and
to
realise
his
weakness
he
learned
in
a
word
that
war
is
a
struggle
between
two
intellects
rather
than
the
conflict
of
masses
and
it
was
by
reason
of
this
knowledge
that
he
played
on
the
hearts
of
his
enemies
with
such
extraordinary
skill
it
is
not
to
be
asserted
however
that
the
study
of
military
history
is
an
infallible
means
of
becoming
a
great
or
even
a
good
general
the
first
qualification
necessary
for
a
leader
of
men
is
a
strong
character
the
second
a
strong
intellect
with
both
providence
had
endowed
jackson
and
the
strong
intellect
illuminates
and
explains
the
page
that
to
others
is
obscure
and
meaningless
with
its
innate
faculty
for
discerning
what
is
essential
and
for
discarding
unimportant
details
it
discovers
most
valuable
lessons
where
ordinary
men
see
neither
light
nor
leading
endowed
with
the
power
of
analysis
and
assimilation
and
accustomed
to
observe
and
to
reflect
upon
the
relations
between
cause
and
effect
it
will
undoubtedly
penetrate
far
deeper
into
the
actual
significance
and
practical
bearing
of
historical
facts
than
the
mental
vision
which
is
less
acute
jackson
by
reason
of
his
antecedent
training
was
eminently
capable
of
the
sustained
intellectual
efforts
which
strategical
conceptions
involve
such
was
his
that
under
the
most
adverse
conditions
the
fatigues
and
anxieties
of
a
campaign
the
fierce
excitement
of
battle
his
brain
to
use
the
words
of
a
great
confederate
general
worked
with
the
precision
of
the
most
perfect
machinery

page
but
it
was
not
only
in
the
field
when
the
necessity
for
action
was
pressing
that
he
was
accustomed
to
seclude
himself
with
his
own
thoughts
nor
was
he
content
with
considering
his
immediate
responsibilities
his
interest
in
the
general
conduct
of
the
war
was
of
a
very
character
while
in
camp
on
the
rappahannock
he
followed
with
the
closest
attention
the
movements
of
the
armies
operating
in
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
made
himself
acquainted
so
far
as
was
possible
not
only
with
the
local
conditions
of
the
war
but
also
with
the
character
of
the
federal
leaders
it
was
said
that
in
the
late
spring
of
it
was
the
intention
of
davis
to
transfer
him
to
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
tennessee
and
it
is
possible
that
some
inkling
of
this
determination
induced
him
to
study
the
western
theatre
in
april
he
wrote
to
his
wife
there
is
increasing
probability
that
i
may
be
elsewhere
as
the
season
advances
that
he
said
no
more
is
characteristic
be
this
as
it
may
the
general
situation
military
and
political
was
always
in
his
mind
and
despite
the
victory
of
fredericksburg
the
future
was
dark
and
the
indications
ominous
according
to
the
official
records
the
north
at
the
beginning
of
april
had
more
than
soldiers
under
arms
the
south
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
not
more
than
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
receiving
constant
reinforcements
and
at
the
beginning
of
april
men
were
encamped
on
the
stafford
heights
in
the
west
the
whole
extent
of
the
mississippi
with
the
exception
of
the
hundred
miles
between
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
was
held
by
the
federals
and
those
important
fortresses
were
both
threatened
by
large
armies
acting
in
concert
with
a
formidable
fleet
of
gunboats
a
third
army
over
strong
was
posted
at
murfreesboro
in
the
heart
of
tennessee
and
large
detached
forces
were
operating
in
louisiana
and
arkansas
the
inroads
of
the
enemy
in
the
west
greatly
aided
by
the
waterways
were
in
fact
far
more
serious
than
in
the
east
but
even
in
virginia
although
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
spent
nearly
two
years
in
advancing
fifty
miles
the
federals
had
a
strong
foothold

while
another
small

of
about
the
same
strength
occupied

berne
on
the
north
carolina
coast
slowly
but
surely
before
the
pressure
of
vastly
superior
numbers
the
frontiers
of
the
confederacy
were
contracting
and
although
in
no
single
direction
had
a
federal
army
moved
more
than
a
few
miles
from
the
river
which
supplied
it
yet
the
hostile
occupation
of
these
rivers
so
essential
to
internal
traffic
was
making
the
question
of
subsistence
more
difficult
every
day
louisiana
texas
and
arkansas
the
states
were
practically
cut
off
from
the
remainder
and
in
a
country
where
railways
were
few
distances
long
and
roads
indifferent
it
was
impossible
in
default
of
communication
by
water
to
accumulate
and
distribute
the
produce
of
the
farms
moreover
the
dark
menace
of
the
blockade
had
assumed
more
formidable
proportions
the
federal
navy
gradually
increasing
in
numbers
and
activity
held
the
highway
of
the
ocean
in
an
iron
grip
and
proudly
though
the
confederacy
bore
her
isolation
men
looked
across
the
waters
with
dread
foreboding
for
the
shadow
of
their
doom
was
already
rising
from
the
pitiless
sea
if
then
his
staff
officers
had
some
reason
to
complain
of
their
chief
silence
and
abstraction
it
was
by
no
means
unfortunate
for
the
south
so
imminent
was
the
danger
that
the
strong
brain
was
incessantly
occupied
in
forecasting
the
emergencies
that
might
occur
but
not
for
a
single
moment
did
jackson
despair
of
ultimate
success
his
faith
in
the
justice
of
the
southern
cause
was
as
profound
as
his
trust
in
god
good
providence
he
had
long
since
realised
that
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
federals
was
more
apparent
than
real
he
recognised
their
difficulties
he
knew
that
the
size
of
an
army
is
limited
to
the
number
that
can
be
subsisted
and
he
relied
much
on
the
superior
morale
and
the
superior
leading
of
the
confederate
troops
after
long
and
mature
deliberation
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
the
policy
to
be
pursued
we
must
make
this
campaign
he
said
in
a
moment
of
unusual
expansion
an
exceedingly
active
one
only
thus
can
a
weaker
country
cope
with
a
stronger
it
must
make
up
in
activity
what
it
lacks
in
strength
a
defensive
campaign
can
only
be
made
successful
by
taking
the
aggressive
at
the
proper
time
napoleon
never
waited
for
his
adversary
to
become
fully
prepared
but
struck
him
the
first
blow
on
these
principles
jackson
had
good
reason
to
believe
general
lee
had
determined
to
act
there
is
no
better
way
of
defending
a
long
line
than
by

was

and
when
his
wife
came
to
visit
him
at
the
end
of
april
she
found
him
in
good
heart
and
the
highest
spirits
he
not
only
anticipated
a
decisive
result
from
the
forthcoming
operations
but
he
had
seen
with
peculiar
satisfaction
that
a
more
manly
tone
was
pervading
the
confederate
army
taught
by
their
leaders
by
lee
jackson
stuart
and
many
others
of
whose
worth
and
valour
they
had
received
convincing
proof
the
southern
soldiers
had
begun
to
practise
the
clean
and
wholesome
virtue
of
they
had
discovered
that
purity
and
temperance

stars
of
rank
mingle
with
the

of

perhaps
the
most
supremely
happy

jackson
one
could
not
says
another
sit
in
that
pulpit
and
meet
the
concentrated
gaze
of
those
men
without
deep
emotion
i
remembered
that
they
were
the
veterans
of
many
a
bloody
field
the
eyes
which
looked
into
mine
waiting
for
the
gospel
of
peace
had
looked
steadfastly
upon
whatever
is
terrible
in
war
their
earnestness
of
aspect
constantly
impressed
me
they
looked
as
if
they
had
come
on
business
and
very
important
business
and
the
preacher
could
scarcely
do
otherwise
than
feel
that
he
too
had
business
of

there
at
this

largely
owing
to
jackson
exertions
chaplains
were
appointed
to
regiments
and
brigades
and
ministers
from
all
parts
of
the
country
were
invited
to
visit
the

the
association
which
did
a
good
work
in
the
army
was
established
at
his
suggestion
and
although
he
steadfastly
declined
to
attend
its
meetings
deeming
them
outside
his
functions
nothing
was
neglected
so
far
as
lay
within
his
power
that
might
forward
the
moral
welfare
of
the
troops
but
at
the
same
time
their
military
efficiency
and
material
comforts
received
his
constant
attention
discipline
was
made
stricter
indolent
and
careless
officers
were
summarily
dismissed
and
the
divisions
were
drilled
at
every
favourable
opportunity
headquarters
had
been
transferred
to
a
tent
near
to
hamilton

it
is
rather
a
relief

there

thereby

will
be
prevented

he
spent
at

as

to

by
all
who

soon
learned

in

it
has
already
been
said
that
while
the
army
of

virginia
lay
in
winter
quarters
the
omens
did
not
point
to
decisive
success
in
the
forthcoming
campaign
during
the
same
period
that
lincoln
and
stanton
taught
by
successive
disasters
had
ceased
to
interfere
with
their
generals
jefferson
davis
and
seddon
his
new
secretary
of

had
taken
into
their
own
hands
the
complete
control
of

results
appeared
in
the
usual
form

the
northern
side

the

and
dispersion

the
confederate

were
fatally
hampered
by
the
orders
of
the

in

the
army
of
northern
virginia
confronted
by
a
mass
of
more
than
foes
was
deprived
of
three
of
longstreet
divisions
and
when
at
the
end
of
april
it
was
reported
that
hooker
was
advancing
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
this
important
detachment
could
rejoin
in
time
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
rappahannock
a
full
discussion
of
the

not
fall
within
the
scope
of
this

in
justice
to
the
southern
generals
to
lee
who
resolved
to
stand
his
ground
and
to
jackson
who
approved
the
resolution
it
must
be
explained
that
they
were
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
absence
of
veterans
undoubtedly
the
situation
on
the
atlantic
littoral
was
sufficiently
embarrassing
to
the
confederate
authorities
the
presence
of
a
federal

at
new

in

threatened
the
main
line
of
railway

which
wilmington
and
charleston
communicated
with
richmond
and
these
two
ports
were
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
confederacy
so
enormous

arising

while
submitting
to

as
a

had
warned

so
to

return

been
probably
occupied
merely
for
purposes
of
defence
it
was
likely
that
they
were
strongly
intrenched
and
nothing
would
be
gained
by
attacking
them
the
warning
however
was
disregarded
and
that
seddon
should
have
yielded
in
the
first
instance
to
the
influence
of
the
exciting
apprehensions
of
sudden
attack
along
the
whole
seaboard
of
the
confederacy
may
be
forgiven
him
important
lines
of
communication
were
certainly
exposed
but
when
in
defiance
of
advice
that
the
divisions
should
be
retained
within
easy
reach
of
fredericksburg
he
suggested
to
longstreet
the
feasibility
of
an
attack
on
suffolk
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
distant
from
the
rappahannock
he
committed
an
unpardonable
blunder
had
jackson
been
in
longstreet
place
the
secretary
proposal
however
promising
of
personal
renown
would
unquestionably
have
been
rejected
the
leader
who
had
kept
the
main
object
so
steadfastly
in
view
throughout
the
valley
campaign
would
never
have
overlooked
the
expressed
wishes
of
the
longstreet
however
brilliant
fighting
soldier
as
he
was
appears
to
have
misconceived
the
duties
of
a
detached
force
he
was
already
prejudiced
in
favour
of
a
movement
against
suffolk
before
he
left
for
his
new
command
he
had
suggested
to
lee
that
one
army
corps
only
should
remain
on
the
rappahannock
while
the
other
operated
south
of
richmond
and
soon
after
his
arrival
he
urged
upon
his
superior
that
in
case
hooker
moved
the
army
of
northern
virginia
should
retire
to
the
north
anna
in
short
to
his
mind
the
operations
of
the
main
body
should
be
made
subservient
to
those
of
the
detached
force
lee
with
men
holding
hooker
in
check
until
longstreet
had
won
his
victory
and
could
march
north
to
join
him
such
strategy
was
not
likely
to
find
favour
at
headquarters
it
was
abundantly
evident
in
the
first
place
that
the
army
of
northern
virginia
must
be
the
principal
objective
of
the
federals
and
in
the
second
place
that
the
defeat
of
the
force
of
suffolk
if
it
were
practicable
would
have
no
effect
whatever
upon
hooker
action
except
insomuch
that
his
knowledge
of
longstreet
absence
might
quicken
his
resolution
to
advance
had
suffolk
been
a
point
vital
to
the
north
the
question
would
have
assumed
a
different
shape
as
it
was
the
town
merely
covered
a
tract
of
conquered
territory
the
norfolk
dockyard
and
the
mouth
of
the
james
river
the
confederates
would
gain
little
by
its
capture
the
federals
would
hardly
feel
its
loss
it
was
most
improbable
that
a
single
man
of
hooker
army
would
be
detached
to
defend
a
point
of
such
comparative
insignificance
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
longstreet
would
be
unable
to
get
back
in
time
to
meet
him
even
on
the
north
anna
general
lee
however
anxious
as
ever
to
defer
to
the
opinions
of
the
man
on
the
spot
as
well
as
to
meet
the
wishes
of
the
government
yielded
to
longstreet
insistence
that
a
fine
opportunity
for
an
effective
blow
presented
itself
and
in
the
first
week
of
april
the
latter
marched
against
suffolk
april
his
movement
was
swift
and
sudden
but
as
lee
had
anticipated
the
federal
position
was
strongly
fortified
with
the
flanks
secure
and
longstreet
had
no
mind
to
bring
matters
to
a
speedy
conclusion
he
could
reduce
the
place
he
wrote
on
april
in
two
or
three
days
but
the
expenditure
of
ammunition
would
be
very
large
or
he
could
take
it
by
assault
but
at
a
cost
of
men
the
secretary
of
war
agreed
with
him
that
the
sacrifice
would
be
too
great
and
so
at
a
time
when
hooker
was
becoming
active
on
the
rappahannock
lee
lieutenant
was
quietly
investing
suffolk
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
away
from
that
moment
the
abandoned
all
hope
that
his
missing
divisions
would
be
with
him
when
hooker
moved
bitterly
indeed
was
he
to
suffer
for
his
selection
of
a
commander
for
his
detached
force
the
loss
of
men
at
suffolk
had
the
works
been
stormed
and
hood
and
pickett
marched
instantly
to
the
rappahannock
would
have
been
more
than
repaid
the
addition
of
fine
soldiers
flushed
with
success
and
led
by
two
of
the
most
brilliant
fighting
generals
in
the
confederate
armies
would
have
made
the
victory
of
chancellorsville
a
decisive
triumph
better
still
had
longstreet
adhered
to
his
original
orders
but
both
he
and
seddon
forgot
as
jackson
never
did
the
value
of
time
and
the
grand
principle
of
concentration
at
the
decisive
point
happily
for
the
south
hooker
although
less
flagrantly
was
also
oblivious
of
the
first
axiom
of
war
as
soon
as
the
weather
improved
he
determined
to
move
against
richmond
his
task
however
was
no
simple
one
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
rappahannock

to

wing
of
the
army
was
to
cross
the
river
below
fredericksburg
make
a
brisk
demonstration
of
attack
and
if
the
enemy
fell
back
follow
him
rapidly
down
the
bowling
green
and
telegraph
roads
then
while
attention
was
thus
attracted
the
right
wing
composed
of
the
fifth
eleventh
and
twelfth
corps
with
pleasonton

of
cavalry
under
hooker
own
command
would
move
up
the
rappahannock
to

push
forward
to
the
rapidan
cross
at
ely

germanna

march
upon
chancellorsville
the
third
corps

to
remain
concentrated
on
the
stafford
heights
ready
to
reinforce
either
wing
as
circumstances
might
require
the
second
corps
was
to
leave
one
division
on
outpost
at
falmouth
and
to
post
two
divisions
on
the
north
bank
of
the
rappahannock
opposite
banks
ford
it
will
be
observed
that
this
design
would
place
a
wide
interval
between
the
two
wings
of
the
federal
army
thus
giving
the
confederates
although
much
inferior
in
numbers
the
advantage
of
the
interior

hooker
however
who
knew
the
confederate
strength
to
a
man
was
confident
that
lee
directly
he
found
his
position
turned
and
stoneman
in
his
rear
would
at
once
retreat
on
richmond
yet
he
was
not
blind
to
the
possibility
that
his
great
adversary
always
daring
might
assume
the
offensive
and
attempt
to
crush
the
federal
wings
in
detail
still
the
danger
appeared
small
either
wing
was
practically
equal
to
the
whole
confederate
force
sedgwick
had
with
the
third
corps
and
a
division
of
the
second
close
at
hand
hooker
with
two
divisions
of
the
second
corps
at
ford
the
third
corps
could
reinforce
him
in
less
than
hours
and
stoneman
sabres
riding
at
will
amongst
lee
supply
depots
would
surely
prevent
him
from
attacking
still
precaution
was
taken
in
case
the
attempt
were
made
sedgwick
if
the
enemy
detached
any
considerable
part
of
his
force
towards
chancellorsville
was
to
carry
the
works
at
all
hazards
and
establish
his
force
on
the
telegraph
road
volume

the
right
wing
if
not
strongly
resisted
was
to
advance
at
all
hazards
and
secure
a
position
uncovering
banks
ford
volume
page
were
the
confederates
found
in
force
near
chancellorsville
it
was
to
select
a
strong
position
and
await
attack
on
its
own
ground
while
sedgwick
coming
up
from
fredericksburg
would
assail
the
enemy
in
flank
and
rear
such
was
the
plan
which
if
resolutely
carried
out
bade
fair
to
crush
lee
army
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstones
and
it
seems
that
the
size
and
condition
of
his
forces
led
hooker
to
anticipate
an
easy
victory
if
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
not
the
finest
on
the
planet
as
in
an
order
of
the
day
he
boastfully
proclaimed
it
it
possessed
many
elements
of
strength
hooker
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
with
a
talent
for
organisation
he
had
not
only
done
much
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
his
troops
but
his
vigorous
measures
had
gone
far
to
restore
their
confidence
when
he
succeeded
burnside
a
large
proportion
of
the
soldiers
had
lost
heart
and
hope
the
generals
who
had
hitherto
commanded
them
when
compared
with
lee
and
jackson
were
mere
pigmies
and
the
consciousness
that
this
was
the
case
had
affected
the
entire
army
the
official
records
contain
much
justification
of
jackson
anxiety
that
burnside
should
be
fought
on
the
north
anna
where
if
defeated
he
might
have
been
pursued
although
there
had
been
no
pursuit
after

continued

terribly
in
morale

set
in

all
operations
were
for
a
while
suspended
the
army
literally
finding
itself
buried
in

there
was
no

the

receive

fearful

generals
out

would
have
considered
the
situation
hopeless
the
confederate
lines
at
fredericksburg
were
certainly
very
strong
but
it
was
clearly
impossible
to
prevent
the
federals
outflanking
them
the
disparity
in
strength
was
far
greater
than
at
sharpsburg

it
seemed
that
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
the
southern
army
must
inevitably
be
driven
back

did
it
appear
so
overwhelming
were
the
federal

usual
resource

the

to
strike

here
however
hooker
communications
with
aquia
creek
were
securely
covered
by
the
rappahannock

so
great
was
his
preponderance
of
strength
that
he
could
easily
detach
a
sufficient
force
to
check
the
confederates
should
they
move
against
them
yet
now
as
on
the
antietam
lee
and
jackson
declined
to
take
numbers
into
consideration
they
knew
that
hooker
was
a
brave
and
experienced
soldier
but
they
had
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would
handle
his
vast
masses
with
more
skill
than
mcclellan
that
the
northern
soldiers
had
suffered
in
morale
they
were
well
aware
and
while
they
divined
that
the
position
they
themselves
had
fortified
might
readily
be
made
untenable
the
fact
that
such
was
the
case
gave
them
small
concern
they
were
agreed
that
the
best
measures
of
defence
if
an
opening
offered
lay
in
a
resolute
offensive
and
with
hooker
in
command
it
was
not
likely
that
the
opportunity
would
be
long
delayed
no
thought

a

instructed

falling

two
things
became
clear
that
it
was
hooker
intention
to
turn
the
confederate
left
that
he
had
divided
his
forces
the
question
now
to
be
decided
was
which
wing
should
be
attacked
first
there
was
much
to
be
said
in
favour
of
crushing
sedgwick
his
numbers
were
estimated
at
men
and
the
confederates
had
over
moreover
time
is
a
most
important
consideration
in
the
use
of
interior
lines
the
army
was
already
concentrated
in
front
of
sedgwick
whereas
it
would
require
a
day
march
to
seek
hooker
in
the
forest
round
chancellorsville
sedgwick
too
was
the
smaller
of
the
federal
wings
and
his
overthrow
would
certainly
ruin
combinations
jackson
at
first
said
lee
preferred
to
attack
sedgwick
force
in
the
plain
of
fredericksburg
but
i
told
him
i
feared
it
was
as
impracticable
as
it
was
at
the
first
battle
of
fredericksburg
it
was
hard
to
get
at
the
enemy
and
harder
to
get
away
if
we
drove
him
into
the
river
but
if
he
thought
it
could
be
done
i
would
give
orders
for
it
jackson
asked
to
be
allowed
to
examine
the
ground
but
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
project
was
too
hazardous
and
that
lee
was
right
orders
were
then
issued
for
a
concentration
against
hooker
men
under
general
early
remaining
to
confront
sedgwick
on
the
heights
of
fredericksburg
we
may
now
turn
to
the
movements
of
the
federals
hooker
right
wing
had
marched
at
a
speed
which
had
been
hitherto
unknown
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
at
nightfall
on
april
the
three
army
corps
although
they
had
been
delayed
by
the
confederate
cavalry
were
assembled
at
chancellorsville
in
three
days
they
had
marched
miles
over
bad
roads
had
forded
two
difficult
rivers
established
several
bridges
and
captured
over
a
hundred
prisoners
the
troops
carried
eight
days
supplies
three
days
cooked
rations
with
bread
and
groceries
in
the
haversacks
five
days
bread
and
groceries
in
the
knapsacks
five
days
beef
on
the
hoof
the
total
weight
carried
by
each
man
including
sixty
rounds
of
ammunition
was
pounds
the
reserve
ammunition
was
carried
principally
by
pack
mules
and
only
a
small
number
of
waggons
crossed
the
rappahannock
four
pontoon
bridges
were
laid
by
the
engineers
one
bridge
took
of
an
hour
to
lay
the
other
three
one
and
a
half
hour
to
lay
and
an
hour
to
take
up
each
bridge
was
from
to
yards
long
volume
pages
heavy
reinforcements
were
in
rear
the
two
divisions
of
the
second
corps
had
marched
from
banks
ford
to
united
states
ford
six
miles
from
chancellorsville
while
the
third
corps
ordered
up
from
the
stafford
heights
was
rapidly
approaching
the
same
point
of
passage
thus
men
in
the
highest
spirits
at
the
success
of
their
manoeuvres
were
massed
in
rear
of
lee
lines
and
hooker
saw
victory
within
his
grasp
it
is
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
ran
his
general
order
that
the
commanding
general
announces
to
his
army
that
the
operations
of
the
last
three
days
have
determined
that
our
enemy
must
either
ingloriously
fly
or
come
out
from
behind
his
defences
and
give
us
battle
on
our
own
ground
where
certain
destruction
awaits
him
the
operations
of
the
fifth
eleventh
and
twelfth
corps
have
been
a
succession
of
splendid
achievements
hooker
was
skinning
the
lion
while
the
beast
yet
lived
but
he
had
certainly
much
reason
for
congratulation
his
manoeuvres
had
been
skilfully
planned
and
energetically
executed
the
two
rivers
which
protected
the
confederate
position
had
been
crossed
without
loss
the
second
and
third
corps
had
been
brought
into
close
touch
with
the
right
wing
lee
earthworks
were
completely
turned
and
cavalry
divisions
driving
the
enemy
patrols
before
them
were
already
within
reach
of
orange
court
house
and
not
more
than
twenty
miles
from
gordonsville
best
of
all
the
interval
between
the
two
wings
miles
on
the
night
of
the
was
now
reduced
to
eleven
miles
by
the
plank
road
two
things
only
were
unsatisfactory
the
absence
of
information
the
fact
that
the
whole
movement
had
been
observed
by
the
confederate
cavalry
pleasonton
brigade
of
horse
had
proved
too
weak
for
the
duty
assigned
to
it
it
had
been
able
to
protect
the
front
but
it
was
too
small
to
cover
the
flanks
and
at
the
flanks
stuart
had
persistently
struck
hooker
appears
to
have
believed
that
stoneman
advance
against
the
central
railroad
would
draw
off
the
whole
of
the
confederate
horse
stuart
however
was
not
to
be
beguiled
from
his
proper
functions
never
were
his
squadrons
more
skilfully
handled
than
in
this
campaign
with
fine
tactical
insight
as
soon
as
the
great
movement
on
chancellorsville
became
pronounced
he
had
attacked
the
right
flank
of
the
federal
columns
with
fitzhugh
lee
brigade
leaving
only
the
two
regiments
under
lee
to
watch
sabres
then
having
obtained
the
information
he
required
he
moved
across
the
federal
front
and
routing
one
of
regiments
in
a
night
affair
near
spotsylvania
court
house
he
had
regained
touch
with
his
own
army
the
results
of
his
manoeuvres
were
of
the
utmost
importance
lee
was
fully
informed
as
to
his
adversary
strength
the
confederate
cavalry
was
in
superior
strength
at
the
critical
point
that
is
along
the
front
of
the
two
armies
and
hooker
had
no
knowledge
whatever
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
space
between
sedgwick
and
himself
he
was
only
aware
on
the
night
of
april
that
the
confederate
position
before
fredericksburg
was
still
strongly
occupied
the
want
however
of
accurate
information
gave
him
no
uneasiness
the
most
careful
arrangements
had
been
made
to
note
and
report
every
movement
of
the
enemy
the
next
day
no
less
than
three
captive
balloons
in
charge
of
skilled
observers
looked
down
upon
the
confederate
earthworks
balloons
which
had
been
first
used
in
the
peninsular
campaign
were
not
much
dreaded
by
the
confederates
the
experience
of
twenty
months
warfare
has
taught
them
how
little
formidable
such
engines
of
war
are
special
correspondent
of
the
times
at
fredericksburg
january
signal
stations
and
observatories
had
been
established
on
each
commanding
height
a
line
of
field
telegraph
had
been
laid
from
falmouth
to
united
states
ford
and
the
chief
of
the
staff
general
butterfield
remained
at
the
former
village
in
communication
with
general
sedgwick
if
the
weather
were
clear
and
the
telegraph
did
not
fail
it
seemed
impossible
that
either
wing
of
the
federal
army
could
fail
to
be
fully
and
instantly
informed
of
the
situation
of
the
other
or
that
a
single
confederate
battalion
could
change
position
without
both
hooker
and
sedgwick
being
at
once
advised
moreover
the
federal
was
so
certain
that
lee
would
retreat
that
his
deficiency
in
cavalry
troubled
him
not
at
all
he
had
determined
to
carry
out
his
original
design
may
the
next
morning
may
the
right
wing
was
to
move
by
the
plank
road
and
uncover
banks
ford
thus
still
further
shortening
the
line
of
communication
between
the
two
wings
and
as
the
chief
of
the
staff
impressed
on
sedgwick
it
was
expected
to
be
on
the
heights
west
of
fredericksburg
at
noon
or
shortly
after
or
if
opposed
strongly
at
night
sedgwick
meanwhile
was
to
observe
the
enemy
movements
with
the
utmost
vigilance
should
he
expose
a
weak
point
to
attack
him
in
full
force
and
destroy
him
should
he
show
any
symptom
of
falling
back
to
pursue
him
with
the
utmost
vigour
volume
page
but
hooker
was
to
find
that
mere
mechanical
precautions
are
not
an
infallible
remedy
for
a
dangerous
situation
the
confederates
had
not
only
learned
long
since
the
importance
of
concealment
and
the
advantage
of
night
marches
but
in
the
early
morning
of
may
the
river
mists
rendered
both
balloons
and
observatories
useless
long
before
the
sun
broke
through
the
fog
both
mclaws
and
jackson
had
joined
anderson
at
tabernacle
church
and
a
strong
line
of
battle
had
been
established
at
the
junction
of
the
two
roads
the
pike
and
the
plank
which
led
east
from
chancellorsville
the
position
was
favourable
running
along
a
low
ridge
partially
covered
with
timber
and
with
open
fields
in
front
beyond
those
fields
a
few
hundred
paces
distant
rose
the
outskirts
of
a
great
forest
stretching
far
away
over
a
gently
undulating
country
this
forest
twenty
miles
in
length
from
east
to
west
and
fifteen
in
breadth
from
north
to
south
has
given
to
the
region
it
covers
the
name
of
the
wilderness
of
spotsylvania
and
in
its
midst
the
federal
army
was
now
involved
never
was
ground
more
unfavourable
for
the
manoeuvres
of
a
large
army
the
timber
was
unusually
dense
the
groves
of
pines
were
immersed
in
a
sea
of
and
luxuriant
undergrowth
the
soil
was
poor
farms
were
rare
and
the
few
clearings
were
seldom
more
than
a
rifle
shot
in
width
the
woodland
tracks
were
seldom
travelled
streams
with
marshy
banks
and
tortuous
courses
were
met
at
frequent
intervals
and
the
only
debouchee
towards
fredericksburg
the
pike
the
plank
road
an
unfinished
line
of
railway
a
mile
south
of
their
junction
and
the
river
road
about
two
miles
north
were
commanded
from
the
confederate
position
when
jackson
arrived
upon
the
scene
anderson
with
the
help
of
engineers
had
strongly
intrenched
the
whole
front
a
large
force
of
artillery
had
already
taken
post
the
flanks
of
the
line
were
covered
the
right
which
extended
to
near
duerson
mill
by
run
and
the
rappahannock
the
left
which
rested
on
the
unfinished
railroad
not
far
from
tabernacle
church
by
the
massaponax
creek
for
the
defence
of
this
position
three
miles
in
length
there
were
present
infantry
over
guns
and
fitzhugh
lee
brigade
of
cavalry
a
force
ample
for
the
purpose
and
giving
about
nine
men
to
the
yard
on
the
rolling
ground
eastward
there
was
excellent
cover
for
the
reserves
and
from
the
breastworks
to
the
front
the
defiles
for
such
owing
to
the
density
of
the
wood
were
the
four
roads
by
which
the
enemy
must
approach
might
be
so
effectively
swept
as
to
prevent
him
from
deploying
either
artillery
or
infantry
but
jackson
was
not
disposed
to
await
attack
only
men
remained
in
the
fredericksburg
lines
to
confront
sedgwick
and
if
that
officer
acted
vigorously
his
guns
would
soon
be
heard
in
rear
of
the
lines
at
tabernacle
church
work
on
the
intrenchments
was
at
once
broken
off
and
the
whole
force
was
ordered
to
prepare
for
an
immediate
advance
on
chancellorsville
before
eleven
the
rear
brigades
had
closed
up
and
marching
by
the
pike
and
the
plank
road
with
a
regiment
of
cavalry
in
advance
and
fitzhugh

upon
the
left
the
confederate
army
plunged
resolutely
into
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
great

the
way
one
brigade
on
the
pike
and
two
on
the
plank
road
a
strong
line
of
skirmishers
covered
his
whole
front
and
his
five
batteries
brought
up
the
rear
next
in
order
came
mclaws
together
with
the
two
remaining
brigades
of
anderson
moving
by
the
pike
while
jackson
three
divisions
were
on
the
plank
road
the
artillery
followed
the
infantry
about
a
mile
towards
chancellorsville
the
federal
cavalry
was
found
in
some
force
and
as
the
patrols
gave
way
a
heavy
force
of
infantry
was
discovered
in
movement
along
the
pike
general
mclaws
who
had
been
placed
in
charge
of
the
confederate
right
immediately
deployed
his
four
leading
brigades
and
after
the
federal
artillery
unlimbering
in
an
open
field
had
fired
a
few
rounds
their
infantry
advanced
to
the
attack
the
fight
was
spirited
but
short
the
northern
regulars
of
sykes
division
drove
in
the
confederate
skirmishers
but
were
unable
to
make
ground
against
the
line
of
battle
jackson
meanwhile
who
had
been
at
once
informed
of
the
encounter
had
ordered
the
troops
on
the
plank
road
to
push
briskly
forward
and
the
federals
finding
their
right
in
danger
of
being
enveloped
retired
on
chancellorsvile
another
hostile
column
was
shortly
afterwards
met
on
the
plank
road
also
marching
eastward
again
there
was
a
skirmish
and
again
jackson
ordering
a
brigade
to
march
rapidly
along
the
unfinished
railroad
had
recourse
to
a
turning
movement
but
before
the
manoeuvre
was
completed
the
federals
began
to
yield
and
all
opposition
gradually
melted
away
the
following
order
was
then
sent
to

there
was
something
mysterious
in
so
easy
a
victory
the
enemy
was
evidently
in
great
strength
for
on
both
roads
heavy
columns
had
been
observed
behind
the
lines
of
skirmishers
several
batteries
had
been
in
action
cavalry
was
present
and
the
confederate
scouts
reported
that
a
third
column
of
all
arms
had
marched
by
the
river
road
toward
banks
ford
and
had
then
like
the
others
unaccountably
withdrawn
the
pursuit
therefore
was
slow
and
circumspect

while
the
main

well
closed

still
kept
to
the
main
highways
at
length
late
in
the
afternoon
hooker
tactics
became
clear
as
jackson
advanced
guards
approached
chancellorsville
the
resistance
of
the
federal
skirmishers
covering
the
retreat
became
more
stubborn
from
the
low
ridge
fringed
by
heavy
timber
on
which
the
mansion
stands
the
fire
of
artillery
raking
every
avenue
of
approach
grew
more
intense
and
it
was
evident
that
the
foe
was
standing
fast
on
the
defensive
the
confederate
infantry
pushing
forward
through
the
undergrowth
made
but
tardy
progress
the
cavalry
patrols
found
that
every
road
and
was
strongly
held
and
it
was
difficult
in
the
extreme
to
discover
hooker
exact
position
jackson
himself
riding
to
the
front
to
reconnoitre
nearly
fell
a
victim
to
the
recklessness
he
almost
invariably
displayed
when
in
quest
of
information
the
cavalry
had
been
checked
at
catherine
furnace
and
were
waiting
the
approach
of
the
infantry
wright
brigade
was
close
at
hand
and
swinging
round
northwards
drove
back
the
enemy
skirmishers
until
in
its
turn
it
was
brought
up
by
the
fire
of
artillery
just
at
this
moment
jackson
galloped
up
and
begged
stuart
to
ride
forward
with
him
in
order
to
find
a
point
from
which
the
enemy
guns
might
be
enfiladed
a
branching
off
from
the
main
road
to
the
right
led
to
a
hillock
about
half
a
mile
distant
and
the
two
generals
accompanied
by
their
staffs
and
followed
by
a
battery
of
made
for
this
point
of
vantage
on
reaching
the
spot
says
stuart
so
dense
was
the
undergrowth
it
was
found
impossible
to
find
enough
clear
space
to
bring
more
than
one
gun
at
a
time
into
position
the
others
closed
up
immediately
behind
and
the
whole
body
of
us
completely
blocked
up
the
narrow
road
scarcely
had
the
smoke
of
our
first
shot
cleared
away
when
a
couple
of
masked
batteries
suddenly
opened
on
us
at
short
range
and
enveloped
us
in
a
storm
of
shell
and
canister
which
concentrated
on
so
narrow
a
space
did
fearful
execution
among
our
party
men
and
horses
falling
right
and
left
the
animals
kicking
and
plunging
wildly
and
everybody
eager
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
confusion
and
get
out
of
harm
way
jackson
as
soon
as
he
found
out
his
mistake
ordered
the
guns
to
retire
but
the
confined
space
so
protracted
the
operation
of
turning
that
the
enemy
cannon
had
full
time
to
continue
their
havoc
covering
the
road
with
dead
and
wounded
that
jackson
and
stuart
with
their
staff
officers
escaped
was
nothing
short
of
miraculous
memoirs
of
the
confederate
war
heros
von
boreke
other
attempts
at
reconnaissance
were
more
successful
before
nightfall
it
was
ascertained
that
hooker
was
in
strong
force
on
the
chancellorsville
ridge
along
the
plank
road
and
on
a
bare
plateau
to
the
southward
called
hazel
grove
here
in
the
words
of
general
lee
he
had
assumed
a
position
of
great
natural
strength
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
dense
forest
filled
with
a
tangled
undergrowth
in
the
midst
of
which
breastworks
of
logs
had
been
constructed
with
trees
felled
in
front
so
as
to
form
an
almost
impenetrable
abattis
his
artillery
swept
the
few
narrow
roads
by
which
the
position
could
be
approached
from
the
front
and
commanded
the
adjacent
woods
the
left
of
his
line
extended
from
chancellorsville
towards
the
rappahannock
covering
the
bark
mill
united

which
communicated
with
the
north
bank
of
the
river
by
a
pontoon
bridge
his
right
stretched
westward
along
the
germanna
ford
road
the
pike
more
than
two
miles
as
the
nature
of
the
country
rendered
it
hazardous
to
attack
by
night
our
troops
were
halted
and
formed
in
line
of
battle
in
front
of
chancellorsville
at
right
angles
to
the
plank
road
extending
on
the
right
to
the
mine
road
and
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
catherine
furnace
as
darkness
falls
upon
the
wilderness
and
the
fire
of
the
outposts
provoked
by
every
movement
of
the
patrols
gradually
dies
away
we
may
seek
the
explanation
of
the
federal
movements
on
finding
that
his
enemy
instead
of
ingloriously
flying
was
advancing
to

it
was
not
till
eleven
on
the
morning

may
that
he
had
marched
in
three
great
columns
towards
fredericksburg

intention
was
to
pass
rapidly
through
the
wilderness
secure
the
open
ground
about
tabernacle

there
with
ample
space
for
deployment
to
form
for

move
against

but
before
his
advanced
guards
got
clear
of
the
forest
defiles
they
found
the
confederates
across
their
path
displaying
an
unmistakable
purpose
of
pressing
the
attack
hooker
at
once
concluded
that
lee
was
marching
against
him
with
nearly
his
whole
force
and
of
the
strength
of
that
force
owing
to
the
weakness
of
his
cavalry
he
was
not
aware
the
news
from
the
stafford
heights
was
disquieting
as
soon
as
the
fog
had
lifted
about
nine
in
the
morning
the
signal
officers
and
balloonists
had
descried
long
columns
of
troops
and
trains
marching
rapidly
towards
chancellorsville
volume
pages
this
was
duly
reported
by
the
telegraph
ibid
page
the
telegraph
however
appears
to
have
worked
badly
and
dispatches
took
several
hours
to
pass
from
falmouth
to
chancellorsville
and
it
was
correctly
inferred
to
signify
that
lee
was
concentrating
against
the
federal
right
but
at
the
same
time
various
movements
were
observed
about
hamilton
crossing
columns
appeared
marching
from
the
direction
of
gurney
station
there
was
much
traffic
on
the
railway
and
several
deserters
from
lee
army
declared
on
being
examined
that
hood
and
pickett
divisions
had
arrived
from
richmond
ibid
page
the
statements
of
these
men
who
we
may
suspect
were
not
such
traitors
as
they
appeared
were
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
sedgwick
who
was
without
cavalry
had
noticed
no
diminution
in
the
force
which
held
the
ridge
before
him
it
is
easy
then
to
understand
hooker
decision
to
stand
on
the
defensive
with
a
prudent
foresight
which
does
him
much
credit
before
he
marched
in
the
morning
he
had
ordered
the
position
about
chancellorsville
covering
his
lines
of
retreat
to
united
states
and
ely
fords
to
be
reconnoitred
and
intrenched
and
his
front
as
lee
said
was
undoubtedly
very
strong
he
would
assuredly
have
done
better
had
he
attacked
vigorously
when
he
found
the
confederates
advancing
his
sudden
retrograde
movement
especially
as
following
the
swift
and
successful
manoeuvres
which
had
turned
lee
position
could
not
fail
to
have
a
discouraging
effect
upon
the
troops
and
if
sedgwick
had
been
ordered
to
storm
the
fredericksburg
lines
the
whole
federal
force
could
have
been
employed
and
the
confederates
assailed
in
front
and
rear
simultaneously
must
to
say
the
least
have
been
embarrassed
but
in
abandoning
his
design
of
crushing
lee
between
his
two
wings
and
in
retiring
to
the
stronghold
he
had
prepared
hooker
did
what
most
ordinary
generals
would
have
done
especially
one
who
had
served
on
the
losing
side
at
fredericksburg
he
had
there
learned
the
value
of
intrenchments
he
had
seen
division
after
division
shatter
itself
in
vain
against
a
stone
wall
and
a
few
and
it
is
little
wonder
that
he
had
imbibed
a
profound
respect
for
defensive
tactics
he
omitted
however
to
take
into
consideration
two
simple
facts
first
that
few
districts
contain
two
such
positions
as
those
of
the
confederates
at
fredericksburg
and
secondly
that
the
strength
of
a
position
is
measured
not
by
the
impregnability
of
the
front
but
by
the
security
of
the
flanks
the
fredericksburg
lines
resting
on
the
rappahannock
and
the
massaponax
had
apparently
safe
flanks
and
yet
he
himself
had
completely
turned
them
rendering
the
whole
series
of
works
useless
without
firing
a
shot
were
lee
and
jackson
the
men
to
knock
their
heads
like
burnside
against
stout
breastworks
strongly
manned
would
they
not
rather
make
a
wide
sweep
exactly
as
he
himself
had
done
and
force
him
to
come
out
of
his
works
hooker
however
may
have
said
that
if
they
marched
across
his
front
he
would
attack
them
en
route
as
did
napoleon
at
austerlitz
and
wellington
at
salamanca
and
cut
their
army
in
two
but
here
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
fatal
defect
of
the
lines
he
had
selected
and
also
of
the
disposition
he
had
made
of
his
cavalry
the
country
near
chancellorsville
was
very
unlike
the
rolling
plains
of
austerlitz
or
the
bare
downs
of
salamanca
from
no
part
of
the
federal
position
did
the
view
extend
for
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
wherever
the
eye
turned
rose
the
dark
and
impenetrable
screen
of
trees
interlaced
with
wild
vines
and
matted
undergrowth
and
seamed
with
rough
roads
perfectly
passable
for
troops
with
which
his
enemies
were
far
better
acquainted
than
himself
had
stoneman
cavalry
been
present
the
squadrons
posted
far
out
upon
the
flanks
and
watching
every
track
might
have
given
ample
warning
of
any
turning
movement
exactly
as
stuart
cavalry
had
given
lee
warning
of
hooker
own
movement
upon
chancellorsville
as
it
was
pleasonton
brigade
was
too
weak
to
make
head
against
stuart
regiments
and
hooker
could
expect
no
early
information
of
his
enemy
movements
he
thus
found
himself
in
the
dilemma
which
a
general
on
the
defensive
if
he
be
weak
in
cavalry
has
almost
invariably
to
face
especially
in
a
close
country
he
was
ignorant
and
must
necessarily
remain
ignorant
of
where
the
main
attack
would
be
made
lee
on
the
other
hand
by
means
of
his
superior
cavalry
could
reconnoitre
the
position
at
his
leisure
and
if
he
discovered
a
weak
point
could
suddenly
throw
the
greater
portion
of
his
force
against
it
hooker
could
only
hope
that
no
weak
point
existed
remembering
that
the
confederates
were
on
the
pike
and
the
plank
road
there
certainly
appeared
no
cause
for
apprehension
the
fifth
corps
with
its
flank
on
the
rappahannock
held
the
left
covering
the
river
and
the
old
mine
roads
next
in
succession
came
the
second
corps
blocking
the
pike
in
the
centre
the
twelfth
corps
under
general
slocum
covered
chancellorsville
the
third
corps
under
sickles
held
hazel
grove
with
berry
division
as
general
reserve
and
on
the
extreme
right
his
breastworks
running
along
the
plank
road
as
far
as
clearing
was
howard
with
the
eleventh
corps
composed
principally
of
german
regiments
strong
outposts
of
infantry
had
been
thrown
out
into
the
woods
the
men
were
still
working
in
the
intrenchments
batteries
were
disposed
so
as
to
sweep
every
approach
from
the
south
the
or
the
and
there
were
at
least
five
men
to
every
yard
of
parapet
the
line
however
six
miles
from
flank
to
flank
was
somewhat
extensive
and

make
certain
so
far
as
possible
that
sufficient
numbers
should
be
forthcoming
to
defend
the
position
at

was
instructed
to
send
the
first
army

to
chancellorsville
before
midnight
moreover

principally
horse

together
with
a
brigade
of
infantry
were
sent
from
falmouth
to
banks
ford
sedgwick
meantime
below
fredericksburg
had
contented
himself
with
engaging
the
outposts
on
the
opposite
ridge
an
order
to
make
a
brisk
demonstration
which
hooker
had
dispatched
at
did
not
arrive
the
telegraph
having
broken
down
until
six
hours
later
and
it
was
then
too
late
to
effect
any
diversion
in
favour
of
the
main
army
yet
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
sedgwick
had
risen
to
the
height
of
his
responsibilities
he
knew
that
a
portion
at
least
of
the
confederates
had
marched
against
hooker
and
the
balloonists
had
early
reported
that
a
battle
was
in
progress
near
tabernacle
church
but
instead
of
obeying
napoleon
maxim
and
marching
to
the
sound
of
the
cannon
he
had
made
no
effort
to
send
support
to
his
commander
both
he
and
general
the
following
letter

interesting
as
showing
the

of

are
liable
to
be
thrown
by
the
absence
of

headquarters
first

may
sedgwick
i
think
the
proper
view
to
take
of
affairs
is
this
if
they
have
not
detached
more
than
hill
division
from
our
front
they
have
been
keeping
up
appearances
showing
weakness
with
a
view
of
delaying
hooker
and
tempting
us
to
make
an
attack
on
their
fortified
position
and
hoping
to
destroy
us
and
strike
for
our
depot
over
our
bridges
we
ought
therefore
in
my
judgment
to
know
something
of
what
has
transpired
on
our
right
john
reynolds
considered
that
to
have
attacked
before
hooker
had
accomplished
some
success
in
view
of
the
strong
position
and
numbers
in
their
front
might
have
failed
to
dislodge
the

have
rendered
them
unserviceable

is
they
were
not
inclined

to
assist

even

chapter
chancellorsville
continued
at
a
council
of
war
held
during
the
night
at
chancellorville
house
the
federal
generals
were
by
no
means
unanimous
as
to
the
operations
of
the
morrow
some
of
the
generals
advised
an
early
assault
others
favoured
a
strictly
defensive
attitude
hooker
himself
wished
to
contract
his
lines
so
as
to
strengthen
them
but
as
the
officers
commanding
on
the
right
were
confident
of
the
strength
of
their
intrenchments
it
was
at
length
determined
that
the
army
should
await
attack
in
its
present
position
three
miles
down
the
plank
road
under
a
grove
of
oak
and
pine
lee
and
jackson
while
their
wearied
soldiers
slept
around
them
planned
for
the
fourth
and
the
last
time
the
overthrow
of
the
great
army
with
which
lincoln
still
hoped
to
capture
richmond
at
this
council
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
if
hooker
had
not
retreated
before
the
morning
and
jackson
thought
it
possible
he
was
already
demoralised
he
was
to
be
attacked
the
situation
admitted
of
no
other
course
it
was
undoubtedly
a
hazardous
operation
for
an
inferior
force
to
assault
an
intrenched
position
but
the
federal
army
was
divided
the
right
wing
involved
in
a
difficult
and
unexplored
country
with
which
the
confederate
generals
and
staff
were
more
or
less
familiar
and
an
opportunity
so
favourable
might
never
recur
fortune
says
napoleon
is
a
woman
who
must
be
wooed
while
she
is
in
the
mood
if
her
favours
are
rejected
she
does
not
offer
them
again
the
only
question
was
where
the
attack
should
be
delivered
lee
himself
had
reconnoitred
the
enemy
left
it
was
very
utrong
resting
on
the
rappahannock
and
covered
by
a
stream
called
mineral
spring
run
two
of
jackson
staff
officers
had
reconnoitred
the
front
and
had
pronounced
it
impregnable
except
at
a
fearful
sacrifice
of
life
but
while
the
generals
were
debating
stuart
rode
in
with
the
reports
of
his
cavalry
officers
and
the
weak
point
of
the
position
was
at
once
revealed
general
fitzhugh
lee
to
whose
skill
and
activity
the
victory
of
chancellorsville
was
in
great
part
due
had
discovered
that
the
federal
right
on
the
plank
road
was
completely
in
the
air
that
is
it
was
protected
by
no
natural
obstacle
and
the
breastworks
faced
south
and
south
only
it
was
evident
that
attack
from
the
west
or
was
not
anticipated
and
lee
at
once
seized
upon
the
chance
of
effecting
a
surprise
yet
the
difficulties
of
the
proposed
operation
were
very
great
to
transfer
a
turning
column
to
a
point
from
which
the
federal
right
might
be
effectively
outflanked
necessitated
a
long
march
by
the
narrow
and
intricate
roadways
of
the
wilderness
and
a
division
of
the
confederate
army
into
two
parts
between
which
communication
would
be
most
precarious
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
the
first
rule
of
war
must
be
violated
but
as
it
has
already
been
said
the
rules
of
war
only
point
out
the
dangers
which
are
incurred
by
breaking
them
and
in
this
case
before
an
enemy
on
the
defensive
from
whom
the
separation
might
be
concealed
until
it
is
too
late
for
him
to
intervene
the
risks
of
dispersion
were
much
reduced
the
chief
danger
lay
in
this
that
the
two
wings
each
left
to
its
own
resources
might
fail
to
act
in
combination
just
as
within
the
past
hours
hooker
and
sedgwick
had
failed
but
lee
knew
that
in
jackson
he
possessed
a
lieutenant
whose
resolution
was
invincible
and
that
the
turning
column
if
entrusted
to
his
charge
would
be
pushed
forward
without
stop
or
stay
until
it
had
either
joined
hands
with
the
main
body
or
had
been
annihilated
moreover
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
had
taught
both
armies
that
the
elaborate
constructions
of
the
engineer
are
not
the
only
or
the
most
useful
resources
of
fortification
hooker
had
ordered
his
position
to
be
intrenched
in
the
hope
that
lee
and
jackson
following
burnside
example
would
dash
their
divisions
into
fragments
against
them
and
thus
become
an
easy
prey
lee
with
a
broader
appreciation
of
the
true
tactical
bearing
of
ditch
and
parapet
determined
to
employ
them
as
a
shelter
for
his
own
force
until
jackson
movement
was
completed
and
the
time
had
come
for
a
general
advance
orders
were
at
once
sent
to
general
mclaws
to
cover
his
front
extending
across
the
pike
and
the
plank
roads
with
a
line
of
breastworks
and
long
before
daylight
the
soldiers
of
his
division
with
the
scanty
means
at
their
disposal
were
busy
as
beavers
amongst
the
timber
it
only
remained
then
to
determine
the
route
and
the
strength
of
the
outflanking
force
and
here
it
may
be
observed
that
the
headquarters
staff
appears
to
have
neglected
certain
precautions
for
which
there
had
been
ample
leisure
so
long
ago
as
march
a
council
of
war
had
decided
that
if
hooker
attacked
he
would
do
so
by
the
upper
fords
and
yet
the
wilderness
lying
immediately
south
of
the
points
of
passage
had
not
been
adequately
examined
had
jackson
been
on
the
left
wing
above
fredericksburg
instead
of
on
the
right
near
hamilton
crossing
we
may
be
certain
that
accurate
surveys
would
have
been
forthcoming
as
it
was
the
charts
furnished
to
the
were
untrustworthy
and
information
had
to
be
sought
from
the
may
about
daylight
on
may
says
major
hotchkiss
general
jackson
awakened
me
and
requested
that
i
would
at
once
go
down
to
catherine
furnace
which
is
quite
near
and
where
a
colonel
welford
lived
and
ascertain
if
there
was
any
road
by
which
we
could
secretly
pass
round
chancellorsville
to
the
vicinity
of
old
wilderness
tavern
i
had
a
map
which
our
engineers
had
prepared
from
actual
surveys
of
the
surrounding
country
showing
all
the
public
roads
but
with
few
details
of
the
intermediate
topography
reaching
welford
i
aroused
him
from
his
bed
and
soon
learned
that
he
himself
had
recently
opened
a
road
through
the
woods
in
that
direction
for
the
purpose
of
hauling
and
iron
ore
to
his
furnace
this
i
located
on
the
map
and
having
asked
welford
if
he
would
act
as
a
guide
if
it
became
necessary
to
march
over
that
road
i
returned
to
when
i
reached
those
i
found
generals
lee
and
jackson
in
conference
each
seated
on
a
cracker
box
from
a
pile
which
had
been
left
there
by
the
federals
the
day
before
in
response
to
general
request
for
my
report
i
put
another
cracker
box
between
the
two
generals
on
which
i
spread
the
map
showed
them
the
road
i
had
ascertained
and
indicated
so
far
as
i
knew
it
the
position
of
the
federal
army
general
lee
then
said
general
jackson
what
do
you
propose
to
do
he
replied
go
around
here
moving
his
finger
over
the
road
which
i
had
located
upon
the
map
general
lee
said
what
do
you
propose
to
make
this
movement
with
with
my
whole
corps
was
the
answer
general
lee
then
asked
what
will
you
leave
me
the

jackson
general

after
a
moment
reflection
remarked
well
go
on
and
then
pencil
in
hand
gave
his
last
instructions
jackson
with
an
eager
smile
upon
his
face
from
time
to
time
nodded
assent
and
when
the
ended
with
the
words
general
stuart
will
cover
your
movement
with
his
cavalry
he
rose
and
saluted
saying
my
troops
will
move

once
sir
letter
to
the
author
a
letter
of
general
lee
to
jackson
which
contains
a
reference
to
this
council
of
war
appears
as
a
note
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
the
necessary
orders
were
forthwith
dispatched
the
trains
parked
in
open
fields
to
the
rear
were
to
move
to
todd
tavern
and
thence
westward
by
interior
roads
the
second
army
corps
was
to
march
in
one
column
rodes
division
in
front
and

in

the
first
virginia

with
whom
was
fitzhugh

covered

squadrons
of

were
on
the
right
hotchkiss
accompanied
by
a
squad
of
couriers
was
to
send
back
constant
reports
to
general
lee
the
commanding
officers
were
impressed
with
the
importance
of
celerity
and
secrecy
the
ranks
were
to
be
kept
well
closed
up
and
all
stragglers
were
to
be
bayoneted
the
day
had
broken
without
a
cloud
and
as
the
troops
began
their
march
in
the
fresh
may
morning
the
green
vistas
of
the
wilderness
grass
under
foot
and
thick
foliage
overhead
were
dappled
with
sunshine
the
men
comprehending
intuitively
that
a
daring
and
decisive
movement
was
in
progress
pressed
rapidly
forward
and
general
lee
standing
by
the
roadside
to
watch
them
pass
saw
in
their
confident
bearing
the
presage
of
success
soon
after
the
first
regiments
had
gone
by
jackson
himself
appeared
at
the
head
of
his
staff
opposite
to
the
he
drew
rein
and
the
two
conversed
for
a
few
moments
then
jackson
rode
on
pointing
in
the
direction
in
which
his
troops
were
moving
his
face
says
an
eyewitness
was
a
little
flushed
as
it
was
turned
to
general
lee
who
nodded
approval
of
what
he
said
such
was
the
last
interview
between
lee
and
jackson
then
during
four
long
hours
for
the
column
covered
at
least
ten
miles
the
flood
of
bright
rifles
and
tattered
uniforms
swept
with
steady
flow
down
the
forest
track
the
artillery
followed
the
guns
drawn
by
lean
and
wiry
horses
and
the
ammunition
waggons
and
ambulances
brought
up
the
rear
in
front
was
a
regiment
of
cavalry
the
virginia
accompanied
by
general
fitzhugh
lee
on
the
flanks
were
some
ten
squadrons
moving
by
the
tracks
nearest
the
outposts
a
regiment
of
infantry
the
georgia
was
posted
at
the
near
catherine
furnace
and
the
plank
road
was
well
guarded
until
anderson
troops
came
up
to
relieve
the
rear
brigades
of
the
second
army
corps
meanwhile
acting
under
the
immediate
orders
of
general
lee
and
most
skilfully
handled
by
mclaws
and
anderson
the
confederates
who
had
been
left
in
position
opposite
the
federal
masses
kept
up
a
brisk
demonstration
artillery
was
brought
up
to
every
point
along
the
front
which
offered
space
for
action
skirmishers
covered
by
the
timber
engaged
the
enemy
pickets
and
maintained
a
constant
fire
and
both
on
the
pike
and
the
river
road
the
lines
of
battle
disposed
so
as
to
give
an
impression
of
great
strength
threatened
instant
assault
despite
all
precautions
however
jackson
movement
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
federals
a
mile
north
of
catherine
furnace
the
eminence
called
hazel
grove
clear
of
timber
looked
down
the
valley
of
the
lewis
creek
and
as
early
as
general
birney
commanding
the
federal
division
at
this
point
reported
the
passage
of
a
long
column
across
his
front
the
indications
however
were
deceptive
at
first
it
is
probable
the
movement
seemed
merely
a
prolongation
of
the
confederate
front
but
it
soon
received
a
different
interpretation
the
road
at
the
point
where
jackson
column
was
observed
turned
due
south
it
was
noticed
that
the
troops
were
followed
by
their
waggons
and
that
they
were
turning
their
backs
on
the
federal
lines
hooker
when
he
received
birney
report
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
lee
finding
the
direct
road
to
richmond
through
bowling
green
threatened
by
sedgwick
was
retreating
on
gordonsville
about
a
battery
was
ordered
into
action
on
the
hazel
grove
heights
the
fire
caused
some
confusion
in
the
confederate
ranks
the
trains
were
forced
on
to
another
road
and
shortly
after
noon
general
sickles
commanding
the
third
army
corps
was
permitted
by
hooker
to
advance
upon
catherine
furnace
and
to
develop
the
situation
division
moved
forward
and
whipple
soon
followed
this
attack
which
threatened
to
cut
the
confederate
army
in
two
was
so
vigorously
opposed
by
anderson
division
astride
the
plank
road
and
by
the
georgia
at
the
furnace
that
general
sickles
was
constrained
to
call
for
reinforcements
barlow
brigade
which
had
hitherto
formed
the
reserve
of
the
eleventh
corps
holding
the
extreme
right
of
the
federal
line
the
flank
at
which
jackson
was
aiming
was
sent
to
his
assistance
pleasonton
cavalry
brigade
followed
sickles
movement
even
before
the
fresh
troops
arrived
had
met
with
some
success
the
georgia
driven
back
to
the
unfinished
railroad
and
surrounded
lost
officers
and
men
but
word
had
been
sent
to
jackson
column
and
colonel
brown
artillery
battalion
together
with
the
brigades
of
archer
and
thomas
rapidly
retracing
their
steps
checked
the
advance
in
front
while
anderson
manoeuvring
his
troops
with
vigour
struck
heavily
against
the
flank
jackson
train
thus
effectively
protected
passed
the
dangerous
point
in
safety
and
then
archer
and
thomas
leaving
anderson
to
deal
with
sickles
drew
off
and
pursued
their
march
these
operations
conducted
for
the
most
part
in
blind
thickets
consumed
much
time
and
jackson
was
already
far
in
advance
moving
in
a
direction
he
had
struck
the
brook
road
a
narrow
track
which
runs
nearly
due
north
and
crosses
both
the
plank
road
and
the
pike
at
a
point
about
two
miles
west
of
the
federal
right
flank
the
brock
road
which
had
stoneman
three
divisions
of
cavalry
been
present
with
the
federal
army
would
have
been
strongly
held
was
absolutely
free
and
unobstructed
since
the
previous
evening
fitzhugh
lee
patrols
had
remained
in
close
touch
with
the
enemy
outposts
and
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
drive
them
in
so
with
no
further
obstacle
than
the
heat
the
second
army
corps
pressed
on
away
to
the
right
echoing
faintly
through
the
wilderness
came
the
sound
of
cannon
and
the
roll
of
musketry
couriers
from
the
rear
galloping
at
top
speed
reported
that
the
trains
had
been
attacked
that
the
rear
brigades
had
turned
back
to
save
them
and
that
the
enemy
in
heavy
strength
had
already
filled
the
gap
which
divided
the
confederate
wings
but
though
the
army
was
cut
in
two
jackson
cast
no
look
behind
him
the
battle
at
the
furnace
made
no
more
impression
on
him
than
if
it
was
being
waged
on
the
mississippi
he
had
his
orders
to
execute
and
above
all
he
was
moving
at
his
best
speed
towards
the
enemy
weak
point
he
knew
and
none
better
that
hooker
would
not
long
retain
the
initiative
that
every
man
detached
from
the
federal
centre
made
his
own
chances
of
success
the
more
certain
and
trusting
implicitly
in
lee
ability
to
stave
off
defeat
he
rode
northwards
with
redoubled
assurance
of
decisive
victory
forward
was
the
cry
and
though
the
heat
was
stifling
and
the
dust
rising
from
the
deep
ruts
on
the
unmetalled
road
rose
in
dense
clouds
beneath
the
trees
and
men
dropped
fainting
in
the
ranks
the
great
column
pushed
on
without
a
check
there
were
three
halts
during
the
march
of
fourteen
miles
letter
from
major
hotchkiss
about
as
the
rear
brigades
archer
and
thomas
after
checking
sickles
were
just
leaving
welford
house
some
six
miles
distant
jackson
himself
had
reached
the
plank
road
the
point
where
he
intended
to
turn
eastward
against
the
federal
flank
here
he
was
met
by
fitzhugh
lee
conveying
most
important
and
surprising
information
the
cavalry
regiment
had
halted
when
it
arrived
on
the
plank
road
all
was
reported
quiet
at
the
front
the
patrols
were
moving
northward
and
attended
by
a
staff
officer
the
young
brigadier
had
ridden
towards
the
turnpike
the
path
they
followed
led
to
a
wide
clearing
at
the
summit
of
a
hill
from
which
there
was
a
view
eastward
as
far
as
dowdall
tavern
below
and
but
a
few
hundred
yards
distant
ran
the
federal
breastworks
with
abattis
in
front
and
long
lines
of
stacked
arms
in
rear
but
untenanted
by
a
single
company
two
cannon
were
seen
upon
the
highroad
the
horses
grazing
quietly
near
at
hand
the
soldiers
were
scattered
in
small
groups
laughing
cooking
smoking
sleeping
and
playing
cards
while
others
were
butchering
cattle
and
drawing
rations
what
followed
is
best
told
in
general
fitzhugh
lee
own
words
i
rode
back
and
met
jackson
general
said
i
if
you
will
ride
with
me
halting
your
columns
here
out
of
sight
i
will
show
you
the
great
advantage
of
attacking
down
the
old
turnpike
instead
of
the
plank
road
the
enemy
lines
being
taken
in
reverse
bring
only
one
courier
as
you
will
be
in
view
from
the
top
of
the
hill
jackson
assented
when
we
reached
the
eminence
the
picture
below
was
still
unchanged
and
i
watched
him
closely
as
he
gazed
on
howard
troops
his
expression
was
one
of
intense
interest
his
eyes
burnt
with
a
brilliant
glow
and
his
face
was
slightly
flushed
radiant
at
the
success
of
his
flank
movement
to
the
remarks
made
to
him
while
the
unconscious
line
of
blue
was
pointed
out
he
made
no
reply
and
yet
during
the
five
minutes
he
was
on
the
hill
his
lips
were
moving
tell
general
rodes
he
said
suddenly
turning
his
horse
towards
the
courier
to
move
across
the
plank
road
and
halt
when
he
gets
to
the
old
turnpike
i
will
join
him
there
one
more
look
at
the
federal
lines
and
he
rode
rapidly
down
the
hill
the
cavalry
supported
by
the
stonewall
brigade
was
immediately
placed
a
short
distance
down
the
plank
road
in
order
to
mask
the
march
of
the
column
at
rodes
was
on
the
turnpike
passing
down
it
for
about
a
mile
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
position
the
troops
were
ordered
to
halt
and
form
for
battle
not
a
shot
had
been
fired
a
few
hostile
patrols
had
been
observed
but
along
the
line
of
breastworks
watched
closely
by
the
cavalry
the
federal
troops
still
in
the
most
careless
security
were
preparing
their
evening
meal
jackson
meanwhile
seated
on
a
stump
near
the
brock
road
had
penned
his
last
dispatch
to
general
lee
near
may
general
the
enemy
has
made
a
stand
at
chancellor
melzi
chancellor
house
otherwise
dowdall
tavern
which
is
about
two
miles
from
chancellorsville
i
hope
as
soon
as
practicable
to
attack
i
trust
that
an
providence
will
bless
us
with
great
success
respectfully
jackson
the
leading
division
is
up
and
the
next
two
appear
to
be
well
closed
general
lee
men
were
now
deploying
in
the
forest
within
a
mile
of
the
federal
works
overlapping
them
both
to
north
and
south
and
not
a
single
general
in
the
northern
army
appears
to
have
suspected
their
presence
the
day
had
passed
quietly
at
chancellorsville
at
a
very
early
hour
in
the
morning
hooker
anticipating
a
vigorous
attack
had
ordered
the
first
army
corps
which
had
hitherto
been
acting
with
sedgwick
below
fredericksburg
to
recross
the
rappahannock
and
march
to
chancellorsville
averell
division
of
cavalry
also
which
had
been
engaged
near
orange
court
house
with
lee
two
regiments
was
instructed
about
the
same
time
to
rejoin
the
army
as
soon
as
possible
and
was
now
marching
by
the
left
bank
of
the
rapidan
to
ely
ford
anticipating
therefore
that
he
would
soon
be
strongly
reinforced
hooker
betrayed
no
uneasiness
shortly
after
dawn
he
had
ridden
round
his
lines
expecting
at
that
time
to
be
attacked
in
front
only
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
their
location
or
construction
as
he
looked
over
the
barricades
says
general
howard
while
receiving
the
cheers
and
salutes
of
the
men
he
said
to
me
strong
how
strong
when
the
news
came
that
a
confederate
column
was
marching
westward
past
catherine
furnace
his
attention
for
the
moment
was
attracted
to
his
right
at
he
was
still
uncertain
as
to
the
meaning
of
jackson
movement
as
the
hours
went
by
however
and
jackson
column
disappeared
in
the
forest
he
again
grew
confident
the
generals
were
informed
that
lee
was
in
full
retreat
towards
gordonsville
and
a
little
later
sedgwick
received
the
following
chancellorsville
may
general
butterfield
the
commanding
directs
that
general
sedgwick
cross
the
river
sic
as
soon
as
indications
will
permit
sedgwick
had
crossed
the
river
on
april
and
capture
fredericksburg
with
everything
in
it
and
vigorously
pursue
the
enemy
we
know
that
the
enemy
is
fleeing
trying
to
save
his
trains
two
of
sickles
divisions
are
among
them
van
alen
and
copy
from
butterfield
at
falmouth
to
sedgwick
at
therefore
the
moment
jackson
vanguard
reached
the
old
turnpike
near
luckett
farm
hooker
believed
that
all
danger
of
a
flank
attack
had
passed
away
his
left
wing
was
under
orders
to
advance
as
soon
as
a
swamp
to
the
front
could
be
corduroyed
and
strike
lee
in
flank
while
to
reinforce
sickles
among
the
trains
williams
division
of
the
twelfth
corps
was
sent
forward
from
the
centre
howard
reserve
brigade
barlow
from
the
right
and
pleasonton
cavalry
brigade
from
hazel
grove
the
officers
in
charge
of
the
federal
right
appear
to
have
been
as
unsuspicious
as
their
commander
during
the
morning
some
slight
preparations
were
made
to
defend
the
turnpike
from
the
westward
a
shallow
line
of
with
a
few
epaulements
for
artillery
had
been
constructed
on
a
low
ridge
commanding
open
fields
which
runs
north
from
dowdall
tavern
and
the
wood
beyond
had
been
partially
entangled
but
this
was
all
and
even
when
the
only
reserve
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
barlow
brigade
was
sent
to
sickles
it
was
not
considered
necessary
to
make
any
change
in
the
disposition
of
the
troops
the
belief
that
lee
and
jackson
were
retreating
had
taken
firm
hold
of
every
mind
the
pickets
on
the
flank
had
indeed
reported
from
time
to
time
that
infantry
was
massing
in
the
thickets
and
the
confederate
cavalry
keeping
just
outside
effective
range
occupied
every
road
and
every
clearing
yet
no
attempt
was
made
by
a
strong
reconnaissance
in
force
to
ascertain
what
was
actually
going
on
within
the
forest
and
the
reports
of
the
scouts
were
held
to
be
exaggerated
the
neglect
was
the
more
marked
in
that
the
position
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
was
very
weak
howard
had
with
him
twenty
regiments
of
infantry
and
six
batteries
but
his
force
was
completely
isolated
his
extreme
right
consisting
of
four
german
regiments
was
posted
in
the
forest
with
two
guns
facing
westward
on
the
pike
and
a
line
of
intrenchments
facing
south
on
the
low
hill
eastward
where
farm
a
small
wooden
cottage
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
clearing
were
two
more
german
regiments
and
two
american
then
near
the
junction
of
the
roads
intervened
a
patch
of
forest
which
was
occupied
by
four
regiments
with
a
brigade
upon
their
left
and
beyond
nearly
a
mile
wide
from
north
to
south
and
five
or
six
hundred
yards
in
breadth
were
the
open
fields
round
the
little
wilderness
church
dipping
at
first
to
a
shallow
brook
and
then
rising
gradually
to
a
house
called
dowdall
tavern
in
these
fields
south
of
the
turnpike
were
the
breastworks
held
by
the
second
division
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
and
here
were
six
regiments
with
several
batteries
in
close
support
the
new
york
and
wisconsin
near
the
hawkins
house
at
the
north
end
of
the
fields
faced
to
the
west
the
remainder
all
faced
south
beyond
tavern
rose
the
forest
dark
and
impenetrable
to

to
the
nearly
two
miles
from
talley
the
clearings
of
hazel
grove
were
plainly
visible
this
part
of
the
line
originally
entrusted
to
general
sickles
was
now
unguarded
for
two
divisions
of
the
third
corps

moving

the
nearest

which
could

was

in

three
miles
distant
from

nearly
two
from

the
confederates
meanwhile
were
rapidly
forming
for
attack
notwithstanding
their
fatigue
for
many
of
the
brigades
had
marched
over
fifteen
miles
the
men
were
in
the
highest
spirits
a
young
who
passed
along
the
column
relates
that
he
was
everywhere
recognised
with
the
usual
greetings

old
jack
we
all

let
him
begin
the
fuss
till
we
get
there
but
on
reaching
the
turnpike
orders
were
given
that
all
noise
should
cease
and
the
troops
deploying
for
a
mile
or
more
on
either
side
of
the
road
took
up
their
formation
for

to

road
notwithstanding
that
the
enemy
might
at
any
moment
awake
to
their
danger
not
a
single
precaution
was
neglected
jackson
was
determined
that
the
troops
should
move
forward
in
good
order
and
that
every
officer
and
man
should
know
what
was
expected
from
him

been
stationed
at
various
points
to
maintain
communication
between
the
divisions
and
the
divisional
and
brigade
commanders
had
received
their
instructions
the
whole
force
was
to
push
resolutely
forward
through
the
forest
the
open
hill
about
a
thousand
yards
eastward
on
which
stood
talley
farm
was
to
be
carried
at
all
hazard
for
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
it
commanded
over
an
intervening
patch
of
forest
the
ridge
which
ran
north
from
dowdall
tavern
after
the
capture
of
the
heights
at
talley
if
the
federals
showed
a
determined
front
on
their
second
line
rodes
was
to
halt
under
cover
until
the
artillery
could
come
up
and
dislodge
them
under
no
other
circumstances
was
there
to
be
any
pause
in
the
advance
a
brigade
of
the
first
line
was
detailed
to
guard
the
right
flank
a
regiment
the
left
and
the
second
and
third
lines
were
ordered
to
support
the
first
whenever
it
might
be
necessary
without
waiting
for
further
instructions
the
field
hospital
was
established
at
the
old
wilderness
tavern
the
men
were
in
position
eagerly
awaiting
the
signal
their
quick
intelligence
had
already
realised
the
situation
and
all
was
life
and
animation
across
the
narrow
clearing
stretched
the
long
grey
lines
penetrating
far
into
the
forest
on
either
flank
in
the
centre
on
the
road
were
four
napoleon
guns
the
horses
fretting
with
excitement
far
to
the
rear
their
rifles
glistening
under
the
long
shafts
of
the
setting
sun
the
heavy
columns
of
hill
division
were
rapidly
advancing
and
the
rumble
of
the
artillery
closing
to
the
front
grew
louder
and
louder
jackson
watch
in
hand
sat
silent
on
little
sorrel
his
slouched
hat
drawn
low
over
his
eyes
and
his
lips
tightly
compressed
on
his
right
was
general
rodes
tall
lithe
and
soldierly
and
on
rodes
right
was
major
blackford
are
you
ready
general
rodes
said
jackson
yes
sir
said
rodes
impatient
as
his
men
you
can
go
forward
sir
said
jackson
a
nod
from
rodes
was
a
sufficient
order
to
blackford
and
the
woods
rang
with
the
notes
of
a
single
bugle
back
came
the
responses
from
bugles
to
right
and
left
and
the
skirmishers
dashing
through
the
wild
undergrowth
sprang
eagerly
to
their
work
followed
by
the
quick
rush
of
the
lines
of
battle
for
a
moment
the
troops
seemed
buried
in
the
thickets
then
as
the
enemy
sentries
completely
taken
by
surprise
fired
a
few
scattered
shots
and
the
guns
on
the
turnpike
came
quickly
into
action
the
echoes
waked
through
the
still
air
of
the
summer
evening
rang
the
rebel
yell
filling
the
forest
far
to
north
and
south
and
the
hearts
of
the
astonished
federals
lying
idly
behind
their
breastworks
stood
still
within
them
so
rapid
was
the
advance
so
utterly
unexpected
the
attack
that
the
pickets
were
at
once
and
crashing
through
the
timber
driving
before
it
the
wild
creatures
of
the
forest
deer
and
hares
and
foxes
the
broad
front
of
the
mighty
torrent
bore
down
upon
howard
flank
for
a
few
moments
the
four
regiments
which
formed
his
right
supported
by
two
guns
held
staunchly
together
and
even
checked
for
a
brief
space
the
advance
of
brigade
but
from
the
right
and
from
the
left
the
grey
infantry
swarmed
round
them
the
second
line
came
surging
forward
to
assistance
the
gunners
were
shot
down
and
their
pieces
captured
and
in
ten
minutes
the
right
brigade
of
the
federal
army
submerged
by
numbers
was
flying
in
panic
across
the
clearing
here
near
talley
farm
on
the
fields
south
of
the
turnpike
and
in
the
forest
to
the
north
another
brigade
hastily
changing
front
essayed
to
stay
the
rout
but
jackson
moving
forward
at
a
gallop
poured
in
canister
at
short
range
and
three
brigades
iverson
and
doles
attacked
the
northerners
fiercely
in
front
and
flank
no
troops
however
brave
could
have
long
withstood
that
overwhelming
rush
the
slaughter
was
very
great
every
mounted
officer
was
shot
down
and
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
the
fragments
of
these
hapless
regiments
were
retreating
rapidly
and
tumultuously
towards
the
wilderness
church
the
first
position
had
been
captured
but
there
was
no
pause
in
the
attack
as
jackson
following
the
artillery
rode
past
talley
farm
and
gazed
across
the
clearing
to
the
east
he
saw
a
sight
which
raised
high
his
hopes
of
a
decisive
victory
already
in
the
green
cornfields
the
spoils
of
battle
lay
thick
around
him
squads
of
prisoners
were
being
hurried
to
the
rear
abandoned
guns
and
waggons
overturned
the
wounded
horses
still
struggling
in
the
traces
were
surrounded
by
the
dead
and
dying
of
howard
brigades
knapsacks
piled
in
regular
order
arms
blankets
accoutrements
lay
in
profusion
near
the
breastworks
and
beyond
under
a
rolling
cloud
of
smoke
and
dust
the
bare
fields
sloping
down
to
the
brook
were
covered
with
fugitives
still
further
eastward
along
the
plank
road
speeding
in
wild
confusion
towards
chancellorsville
was
a
dense
mass
of
men
and
waggons
cattle
maddened
with
fright
were
rushing
to
and
fro
and
on
the
ridge
beyond
the
little
church
pushing
their
way
through
the
throng
like
ships
through
a
heavy
sea
or
breaking
into
fragments
before
the
pressure
the
irregular
lines
of
a
few
small
regiments
were
moving
hastily
to
the
front
at
more
than
one
point
on
the
edge
of
the
distant
woods
guns
were
coming
into
action
the
hill
near
talley
farm
was
covered
with
projectiles
men
were
falling
and
the
confederate
first
line
was
already
in
some
confusion
galloping
up
the
turnpike
and
urging
the
artillery
forward
with
voice
and
gesture
jackson
passed
through
the
ranks
of
his
eager
infantry
and
then
rodes
division
rushing
down
the
wooded
slopes
burst
from
the
covert
and
driving
their
flying
foes
before
them
advanced
against
the
trenches
on
the
opposite
ridge
here
and
there
the
rush
of
the
first
line
was
checked
by
the
bold
resistance
of
the
german
regiments
on
the
right
especially
progress
was
slow
for
colquitt
brigade
drawn
off
by
the
pressure
of
federal
outposts
in
the
woods
to
the
south
had
lost
touch
with
the
remainder
of
the
division
ramseur
brigade
in
rear
had
been
compelled
to
follow
suit
and
on
this
flank
the
federals
were
most
effectively
supported
by
their
artillery
but
iverson
and
doles
hardly
halting
to
reform
as
they
left
the
woods
and
followed
closely
by
the
second
line
swept
rapidly
across
the
fields
dashed
back
the
regiments
which
sought
to
check
them
and
under
a
hot
fire
of
grape
and
canister
pressed
resolutely
forward
the
on
the
ridge
were
occupied
by
the
last
brigade
of
howard
army
corps
a
battery
was
in
rear
three
more
were
on
the
left
near
dowdall
tavern
and
many
of
the
fugitives
from
farm
had
rallied
behind
the
breastwork
but
a
few
guns
and
four
or
five
thousand
rifles
although
the
ground
to
the
front
was
clear
and
open
were
powerless
to
arrest
the
rush
of
jackson
veterans
the
long
lines
of
colours
tossing
redly
above
the
swiftly
moving
ranks
never
for
a
moment
faltered
the
men
running
alternately
to
the
front
delivered
their
fire
stopped
for
a
moment
to
load
and
then
again
ran
on
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
until
the
defenders
of
the
trenches
already
half
demoralised
could
mark
through
the
the
tanned
faces
the
fierce
eyes
and
the
gleaming
bayonets
of
their
terrible
foes
the
guns
were
already
flying
and
the
position
was
outflanked
yet
along
the
whole
length
of
the
ridge
the
parapets
still
blazed
with
fire
and
while
men
fell
headlong
in
the
confederate
ranks
for
a
moment
there
was
a
check
but
it
was
the
check
of
a
mighty
wave
mounting
slowly
to
full
volume
ere
it
falls
in
thunder
on
the
shrinking
sands
running
to
the
front
with
uplifted
swords
the
officers
gave
the
signal
for
the
charge
the
men
answered
with
a
yell
of
triumph
the
second
line
closing
rapidly
on
the
first
could
no
longer
be
restrained
and
as
the
grey
masses
crowding
together
in
their
excitement
breasted
the
last
slope
the
federal
infantry
in
every
quarter
of
the
field
gave
way
before
them
the
ridge
was
abandoned
and
through
the
dark
pines
beyond
rolled
the
rout
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
it
was
seven
twilight
was
falling
on
the
woods
and
and
colston
divisions
had
become
so
inextricably
mingled
that
officers
could
not
find
their
men
nor
men
their
officers
but
jackson
galloping
into
the
disordered
ranks
directed
them
to
press
the
pursuit
his
face
was
aglow
with
the
blaze
of
battle
his
swift
gestures
and
curt
orders
admitting
of
no
question
betrayed
the
fierce
intensity
of
his
resolution
although
the
great
tract
of
forest
covering
chancellorsville
on
the
west
had
swallowed
up
the
fugitives
he
had
no
need
of
vision
to
reveal
to
him
the
extent
of
his
success
men
had
been
utterly
defeated
the
enemy
right
wing
was
scattered
to
the
winds
the
southerners
were
within
a
of
the
federals
centre
and
completely
in
rear
of
their
intrenchments
and
the
white
house
or
bullock
road
only
to
the
front
led
directly
to
hooker
line
of
retreat
by
the
united
states
ford
until
that
road
was
in
his
possession
jackson
was
determined
to
call
no
halt
the
dense
woods
the
gathering
darkness
the
fatigue
and
disorder
of
his
troops
he
regarded
no
more
than
he
did
the
enemy
overwhelming
numbers
in
spirit
he
was
standing
at
hooker
side
and
he
saw
as
clearly
as
though
the
intervening
woods
had
been
swept
away
the
condition
to
which
his
adversary
had
been
reduced
to
the
federal
headquarters
confusion
and
dismay
had
come
indeed
with
appalling
suddenness
late
in
the
afternoon
hooker
was
sitting
with
two
in
the
verandah
of
the
chancellor
house
there
were
few
troops
in
sight
the
third
corps
and
pleasonton
cavalry
had
long
since
disappeared
in
the
forest
the
twelfth
army
corps
with
the
exception
of
two
brigades
was
already
advancing
against
anderson
and
only
the
trains
and
some
artillery
remained
within
the
intrenchments
at
hazel
grove
all
was
going
well
a
desultory
firing
broke
out
at
intervals
to
the
eastward
but
it
was
not
sustained
and
three
miles
to
the
south
where
as
hooker
believed
in
pursuit
of
jackson
sickles
and
pleasonton
were
the
reports
of
their
cannon
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
pushed
further
south
betokened
no
more
than
a
lively
skirmish
the
quiet
of
the
wilderness
save
for
those
distant
sounds
was
undisturbed
and
men
and
animals
free
from
every
care
were
enjoying
the
calm
of
the
summer
evening
it
was
about
six
suddenly
the
cannonade
swelled
to
a
heavier
roar
and
the
sound
came
from
a
new
direction
all
were
listening
intently
speculating
on
what
this
might
mean
when
a
who
had
stepped
out
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
was
looking
down
the
plank
road
with
his
glass
exclaimed
my
god
here
they
come
hooker
sprang
upon
his
horse
and
riding
rapidly
down
the
road
met
the
stragglers
of
the
eleventh
corps
men
waggons
and
ambulances
an
crowd
rushing
in
blind
terror
from
the
forest
flying
they
knew
not
whither
the
whole
of
the
right
wing
they
said
overwhelmed
by
superior
numbers
was
falling
back
on
chancellorsville
and
stonewall
jackson
was
in
hot
pursuit
the
situation
had
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
just
now
congratulating
himself
on
the
complete
success
of
his
manoeuvres
on
the
retreat
of
his
enemies
on
the
flight
of
jackson
and
the
helplessness
of
lee
hooker
saw
his
strong
intrenchments
taken
in
reverse
his
army
scattered
his
reserves
far
distant
and
the
most
dreaded
of
his
opponents
followed
by
his
victorious
veterans
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
his
headquarters
his
weak
point
had
been
found
and
there
were
no
troops
at
hand
wherewith
to
restore
the
fight
the
centre
was
held
only
by
the
two
brigades
of
the
twelfth
corps
at
the
fairview
cemetery
the
works
at
hazel
grove
were
untenanted
save
by
a
few
batteries
and
a
handful
of
infantry
the
second
and
fifth
corps
on
the
left
were
fully
occupied
by
mclaws
for
lee
at
the
first
sound
of
jackson
guns
had
ordered
a
vigorous
attack
up
the
pike
and
the
plank
road
sickles
with
men
was
far
away
isolated
and
perhaps
surrounded
and
the
line
of
retreat
the
road
to
united
states
ford
was
absolutely
unprotected
messengers
were
dispatched
in
hot
haste
to
recall
sickles
and
pleasonton
to
hazel
grove
berry
division
forming
the
reserve
of
the
chancellor
house
was
summoned
to
fairview
and
hays
brigade
of
the
second
corps
ordered
to
support
it
but
what
could
three
small
brigades
hurried
into
position
and
unprotected
by
intrenchments
avail
against
southerners
led
by
stonewall
jackson
and
animated
by
their
easy
victory
if
berry
and
hays
could
stand
fast
against
the
rush
of
fugitives
it
was
all
that
could
be
expected
and
as
the
uproar
in
the
dark
woods
swelled
to
a
deeper
volume
and
the
yells
of
the
confederates
mingled
with
the
crash
of
the
musketry
were
borne
to
his
ears
hooker
must
have
felt
that
all
was
lost
to
make
matters
worse
as
pleasonton
hurrying
back
with
his
cavalry
arrived
at
hazel
grove
the
trains
of
the
third
army
corps
fired
on
by
the
confederate
skirmishers
dashed
wildly
across
the
clearing
swept
through
the
parked
artillery
and
breaking
through
the
forest
increased
the
fearful
tumult
which
reigned
round
chancellorsville
the
gunners
however
with
a
courage
beyond
all
praise
stood
staunchly
to
their
pieces
and
soon
a
long
line
of
artillery
for
which
two
regiments
of
the
third
army
corps
coming
up
rapidly
from
the
south
formed
a
sufficient
escort
was
established
on
this
commanding
hill
other
batteries
hitherto
held
in
reserve
took
post
on
the
high
ground
at
fairview
a
mile
to
the
and
although
berry
infantry
were
not
yet
in
position
and
the
stream
of
broken
troops
was
still
pouring
past
a
strong
front
of
fifty
guns
opposed
the
confederate
advance
but
it
was
not
the
artillery
that
saved
hooker
from
irretrievable
disaster
hamlin
the
latest
historian
of
chancellorsville
has
completely
disposed
of
the
legend
that
these
fifty
guns
repulsed
a
desperate
attack
on
hazel
grove
as
they
followed
the
remnants
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
the
progress
of
rodes
and
colston
had
been
far
less
rapid
than
when
they
stormed
forward
past
the
wilderness
church
a
regiment
of
federal
cavalry
riding
to
howard
aid
by
a
track
from
hazel
grove
to
the
plank
road
was
quickly
swept
aside
but
the
deep
darkness
of
the
forest
the
efforts
of
the
officers
to
the
ranks
the
barriers
opposed
by
the
tangled
undergrowth
the
difficulty
of
keeping
the
direction
brought
a
large
portion
of
the
troops
to
a
standstill
at
the
junction
of
the
white
house
road
the
order
to
halt
was
given
and
although
a
number
of
men
pushing
impetuously
forward
seized
a
line
of
log
breastworks
which
ran
through
the
timber
below
the
fairview
heights
the
pursuit
was
stayed
in
the
midst
of
the
dense
thickets
at
this
moment
shortly
after
eight
jackson
was
at
tavern
the
reports
from
the
front
informed
him
that
his
first
and
second
lines
had
halted
general
rodes
who
had
galloped
up
the
plank
road
to
reconnoitre
sent
in
word
that
there
were
no
federal
troops
to
be
seen
between
his
line
and
the
fairview
heights
and
colonel
cobb
of
the
virginia
brought
the
news
that
the
strong
intrenchments
less
than
a
mile
from
chancellorsville
had
been
occupied
without
resistance
there
was
a
lull
in
the
battle
the
firing
had
died
away
and
the
excited
troops
with
a
clamour
that
was
heard
in
the
federal
lines
sought
their
companies
and
regiments
by
the
dim
light
of
the
rising
moon
but
deeming
that
nothing
was
done
while
aught
remained
to
do
jackson
was
already
planning
a
further
movement
sending
instructions
to
hill
to
relieve
rodes
and
colston
and
to
prepare
for
a
night
attack
he
rode
forward
almost
unattended
amongst
his
rallying
troops
and
lent
his
aid
to
the
efforts
of
the
regimental
officers
intent
on
bringing
up
the
two
divisions
in
close
support
of
hill
he
passed
from
one
regiment
to
another
turning
to
colonel
cobb
he
said
to
him
find
general
rodes
and
tell
him
to
occupy
the
in
the
woods
west
of
the
fairview
heights
at
once
and
then
added
i
need
your
help
for
a
time
this
disorder
must
be
corrected
as
you
go
along
the
right
tell
the
troops
from
me
to
get
into
line
and
preserve
their
order
it
was
long
however
before
the
men
could
be
assembled
and
the
delay
was
increased
by
an
unfortunate
incident
jackson
chief
of
artillery
pressing
forward
up
the
plank
road
to
within
a
thousand
yards
of
chancellorsville
opened
fire
with
three
guns
upon
the
enemy
position
this
audacious
proceeding
evoked
a
quick
reply
such
federal
guns
as
could
be
brought
to
bear
were
at
once
turned
upon
the
road
and
although
the
damage
done
was
small
brigades
just
coming
up
into
line
were
for
the
moment
checked
under
the
hail
of
shell
and
canister
the
artillery
horses
became
unmanageable
the
drivers
lost
their
nerve
and
as
they
rushed
to
the
rear
some
of
the
infantry
joined
them
and
a
stampede
was
only
prevented
by
the
personal
efforts
of
jackson
colston
and
their
colonel
crutchfield
was
then
ordered
to
cease
firing
the
federals
did
the
same
and
hill
brigades
that
of
general
lane
leading
advanced
to
the
deserted
breastworks
while
two
brigades
one
from
rodes
division
and
one
from
colston
were
ordered
to
guard
the
roads
from
hazel
grove
these
arrangements
made
jackson
proceeded
to
join
his
advanced
line
at
the
point
where
the
track
to
the
white
house
and
united
states
ford
strikes
the
plank
road
he
met
general
lane
seeking
his
instructions
for
the
attack
they
were
sufficiently
brief
push
right
ahead
lane
right
ahead
as
lane
galloped
off
to
his
command
general
hill
and
some
of
his
staff
came
up
and
jackson
gave
hill
his
orders
press
them
cut
them
off
from
the
united
states
ford
hill
press
them
general
hill
replied
that
he
was
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
topography
of
the
country
and
asked
for
an
officer
to
act
as
guide
jackson
directed
captain
boswell
his
chief
engineer
to
accompany
general
hill
and
then
turning
to
the
front
rode
up
the
plank
road
passing
quickly
through
the
ranks
of
the
north
carolina
of
lane
brigade
two
or
three
hundred
yards
eastward
the
general
halted
for
the
ringing
of
axes
and
the
words
of
command
were
distinctly
audible
in
the
enemy
lines
while
the
confederates
were
hooker
reserves
had
reached
the
front
and
berry
regiments
on
the
fairview
heights
using
their
bayonets
and
for
intrenching
tools
piling
up
the
earth
with
their
hands
and
hacking
down
the
brushwood
with
their
knives
were
endeavouring
in
desperate
haste
to
provide
some
shelter
however
slight
against
the
rush
that
they
knew
was
about
to
come
after
a
few
minutes
becoming
impatient
for
the
advance
of
division
jackson
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
his
own
lines
general
said
an
officer
who
was
with
him
you
should
not
expose
yourself
so
much
there
is
no
danger
sir
the
enemy
is
routed
go
back
and
tell
general
hill
to
press
on
once
more
when
he
was
only
sixty
or
eighty
yards
from
where
the
north
carolina
were
standing
in
the
trees
he
drew
rein
and
listened
the
whole
party
generals
and
couriers
hidden
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
silent
woods
at
this
moment
a
single
rang
out
with
startling
suddenness
a
detachment
of
federal
infantry
groping
their
way
through
the
thickets
had
approached
the
southern
lines
the
skirmishers
on
both
sides
were
now
engaged
and
the
lines
of
battle
in
rear
became
keenly
on
the
alert
some
mounted
officers
galloped
hastily
back
to
their
commands
the
sound
startled
the
confederate
soldiers
and
an
officer
of
the
north
carolina
seeing
a
group
of
strange
horsemen
riding
towards
him
through
the
darkness
for
jackson
hearing
the
firing
had
turned
back
to
his
own
lines
gave
the
order
to
fire
the
volley
was
fearfully
effective
men
and
horses
fell
dead
and
dying
on
the
narrow
track
jackson
himself
received
three
bullets
one
in
the
right
hand
and
two
in
the
left
arm
cutting
the
main
artery
and
crushing
the
bone
below
the
shoulder
and
as
the
reins
dropped
upon
his
neck
little
sorrel
frantic
with
terror
plunged
into
the
wood
and
rushed
towards
the
federal
lines
an
overhanging
bough
struck
his
rider
violently
in
the
face
tore
off
his
cap
and
nearly
unhorsed
him
but
recovering
his
seat
he
managed
to
seize
the
bridle
with
his
bleeding
hand
and
turned
into
the
road
here
captain
wilbourn
one
of
his
succeeded
in
catching
the
reins
and
as
the
horse
stopped
jackson
leaned
forward
and
fell
into
his
arms
captain
hotchkiss
who
had
just
returned
from
a
reconnaissance
rode
off
to
find
mcguire
while
captain
wilbourn
with
a
small
penknife
ripped
up
the
sleeve
of
the
wounded
arm
as
he
was
doing
so
general
hill
who
had
himself
been
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
north
carolinians
reached
the
scene
and
throwing
himself
from
his
horse
pulled
off
jackson
gauntlets
which
were
full
of
blood
and
bandaged
the
shattered
arm
with
a
handkerchief
general
he
said
are
you
much
hurt
i
think
i
am
was
the
reply
and
all
my
wounds
are
from
my
own
men
i
believe
my
right
arm
is
broken
to
all
questions
put
to
him
he
answered
in
a
perfectly
calm
and
tone
and
although
he
spoke
no
word
of
complaint
he
was
manifestly
growing
weaker
it
seemed
impossible
to
move
him
and
yet
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
be
carried
to
the
rear
he
was
still
in
front
of
his
own
lines
and
even
as
hill
was
speaking
two
of
the
enemy
skirmishers
emerging
from
the
thicket
halted
within
a
few
paces
of
the
little
group
hill
turning
quietly
to
his
escort
said
take
charge
of
those
men
and
two
orderlies
springing
forward
seized
the
rifles
of
the
astonished
federals
lieutenant
morrison
jackson
who
had
gone
down
the
road
to
reconnoitre
now
reported
that
he
had
seen
a
section
of
artillery
unlimbering
close
at
hand
hill
gave
orders
that
the
general
should
be
at
once
removed
and
that
no
one
should
tell
the
men
that
he
was
wounded
jackson
lying
on
hill
breast
opened
his
eyes
and
said
tell
them
simply
that
you
have
a
wounded
confederate
officer
lieutenants
smith
and
morrison
and
captain
leigh
of
staff
now
lifted
him
to
his
feet
and
with
their
aid
he
walked
a
few
steps
through
the
trees
but
hardly
had
they
gained
the
road
when
the
federal
batteries
along
their
whole
front
opened
a
terrible
fire
of
grape
and
canister
the
storm
of
bullets
tearing
through
the
foliage
was
fortunately
directed
too
high
and
the
three
young
officers
laying
the
general
down
by
the
roadside
endeavoured
to
shield
him
by
lying
between
him
and
the
deadly
hail
the
earth
round
them
was
torn
up
by
the
shot
covering
them
with
dust
boughs
fell
from
the
trees
and
fire
flashed
from
the
flints
and
gravel
of
the
roadway
once
jackson
attempted
to
rise
but
smith
threw
his
arm
over
him
holding
him
down
and
saying
general
you
must
be
still
it
will
cost
you
your
life
to
rise
after
a
few
minutes
however
the
enemy
gunners
changing
from
canister
to
shell
mercifully
increased
their
range
and
again
as
the
confederate
infantry
came
hurrying
to
the
front
their
wounded
leader
supported
by
strong
arms
was
lifted
to
his
feet
anxious
that
the
men
should
not
recognise
him
jackson
turned
aside
into
the
wood
and
slowly
and
painfully
dragged
himself
through
the
undergrowth
as
he
passed
along
general
fender
whose
brigade
was
then
pushing
forward
asked
smith
who
it
was
that
was
wounded
a
confederate
officer
was
the
reply
but
as
they
came
nearer
fender
despite
the
darkness
saw
that
it
was
jackson
springing
from
his
horse
he
hurriedly
expressed
his
regret
and
added
that
his
lines
were
so
much
disorganised
by
the
enemy
artillery
that
he
feared
it
would
be
necessary
to
fall
back
at
this
moment
says
an
the
scene
was
a
fearful
one
the
air
seemed
to
be
alive
with
the
shriek
of
shells
and
the
whistling
of
bullets
horses
riderless
and
mad
with
fright
dashed
in
every
direction
hundreds
left
the
ranks
and
hurried
to
the
rear
and
the
groans
of
the
wounded
and
dying
mingled
with
the
wild
shouts
of
others
to
be
led
again
to
the
assault
almost
fainting
as
he
was
from
loss
of
blood
desperately
wounded
and
in
the
midst
of
this
awful
uproar
heart
was
unshaken
the
words
of
fender
seemed
to
rouse
him
to
life
pushing
aside
those
who
supported
him
he
raised
himself
to
his
full
height
and
answered
feebly
but
distinctly
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
din
must
hold
your
ground
general
fender
you
must
hold
out
to
the
last
sir
his
strength
was
now
completely
gone
and
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
lie
down
his
however
refused
assent
the
shells
were
still
crashing
through
the
forest
and
a
litter
having
been
brought
up
by
captain
leigh
he
was
carried
slowly
towards
tavern
but
before
they
were
free
of
the
tangled
wood
one
of
the
struck
by
a
shot
in
the
arm
let
go
the
handle
jackson
fell
violently
to
the
ground
on
his
wounded
side
his
agony
must
have
been
intense
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
heard
to
groan
smith
sprang
to
his
side
and
as
he
raised
his
head
a
bright
beam
of
moonlight
made
its
way
through
the
thick
foliage
and
rested
upon
his
white
and
lacerated
face
the
was
startled
by
its
great
pallor
and
stillness
and
cried
out
general
are
you
seriously
hurt
no
smith
do
trouble
yourself
about
me
he
replied
quietly
and
added
some
words
about
winning
the
battle
first
and
attending
to
the
wounded
afterwards
he
was
again
placed
upon
the
litter
and
carried
a
few
hundred
yards
still
followed
by
the
federal
shells
to
where
his
medical
director
was
waiting
with
an
ambulance
mcguire
knelt
down
beside
him
and
said
i
hope
you
are
not
badly
hurt
general
he
replied
very
calmly
but
feebly
i
am
badly
injured
doctor
i
fear
i
am
dying
after
a
pause
he
went
on
i
am
glad
you
have
come
i
think
the
wound
in
my
shoulder
is
still
bleeding
the
bandages
were
readjusted
and
he
was
lifted
into
the
ambulance
where
colonel
crutchfield
who
had
also
been
seriously
wounded
was
already
lying
whisky
and
morphia
were
administered
and
by
the
light
of
pine
torches
carried
by
a
few
soldiers
he
was
slowly
driven
through
the
fields
where
hooker
right
had
so
lately
fled
before
his
impetuous
onset
all
was
done
that
could
ease
his
sufferings
but
some
jolting
of
the
ambulance
over
the
rough
road
was
unavoidable
and
yet
writes
mcguire
his
uniform
politeness
did
not
forsake
him
even
in
these
most
trying
circumstances
his
complete
control
too
over
his
mind
enfeebled
as
it
was
by
loss
of
blood
and
pain
was
wonderful
his
suffering
was
intense
his
hands
were
cold
his
skin
clammy
but
not
a
groan
escaped
him
not
a
sign
of
suffering
except
the
light
corrugation
of
the
brow
the
fixed
rigid
face
the
thin
lips
so
tightly
compressed
that
the
impression
of
the
teeth
could
be
seen
through
them
except
these
he
controlled
by
his
iron
will
all
evidence
of
emotion
and
more
difficult
than
this
even
he
controlled
that
disposition
to
restlessness
which
many
of
us
have
observed
upon
the
as
attending
great
loss
of
blood
nor
was
he
forgetful
of
others
he
expressed
very
feelingly
his
sympathy
for
crutchfield
and
once
when
the
latter
groaned
aloud
he
directed
the
ambulance
to
stop
and
requested
me
to
see
if
something
could
not
be
done
for
his
relief
after
reaching
the
hospital
he
was
carried
to
a
tent
and
placed
in
bed
covered
with
blankets
and
another
drink
of
whisky
and
water
given
him
two
hours
and
a
half
elapsed
before
sufficient
reaction
took
place
to
warrant
an
examination
and
at
two
on
sunday
morning
i
informed
him
that
chloroform
would
be
given
him
i
told
him
also
that
amputation
would
probably
be
required
and
asked
if
it
was
found
necessary
whether
it
should
be
done
at
once
he
replied
promptly
yes
certainly
mcguire
do
for
me
whatever
you
think
best
chloroform
was
then
administered
and
the
left
arm
amputated
about
two
inches
below
the
shoulder
throughout
the
whole
of
the
operation
and
until
all
the
dressings
were
applied
he
continued
insensible
about
three
colonel
then
major
pendleton
arrived
at
the
hospital
he
stated
that
general
hill
had
been
wounded
and
that
the
troops
were
in
great
disorder
general
stuart
was
in
command
and
had
sent
him
to
see
the
general
at
first
i
declined
to
permit
an
interview
but
pendleton
urged
that
the
safety
of
the
army
and
success
of
the
cause
depended
upon
his
seeing
him
when
he
entered
the
tent
the
general
said
major
i
am
glad
to
see
you
i
thought
you
were
killed
pendleton
briefly
explained
the
position
of
affairs
gave
stuart
message
and
asked
what
should
be
done
jackson
was
at
once
interested
and
asked
in
his
quick
way
several
questions
when
they
were
answered
he
remained
silent
evidently
trying
to
think
he
contracted
his
brow
set
his
mouth
and
for
some
moments
lay
obviously
endeavouring
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
for
a
moment
we
believed
he
had
succeeded
for
his
nostrils
dilated
and
his
eye
flashed
with
its
old
fire
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
his
face
relaxed
again
and
presently
he
answered
very
feebly
and
sadly
do
know
i
ca
tell
say
to
general
stuart
he
must
do
what
he
thinks
best
soon
after
this
he
slept
so
leaving
behind
him
struggling
vainly
against
the
oppression
of
his
mortal
hurt
the
one
man
who
could
have
completed
the
confederate
victory
pendleton
rode
wearily
through
the
night
jackson
fall
at
so
critical
a
moment
just
as
the
final
blow
was
to
be
delivered
had
proved
a
terrible
disaster
hill
who
alone
knew
his
intention
of
moving
to
the
white
house
had
been
wounded
by
a
fragment
of
shell
as
he
rode
back
to
lead
his
troops
boswell
who
had
been
ordered
to
point
out
the
road
had
been
killed
by
the
same
volley
which
struck
down
his
chief
and
the
subordinate
generals
without
instructions
and
without
guides
with
their
men
in
disorder
and
the
artillery
playing
fiercely
on
the
forest
had
hesitated
to
advance
hill
remaining
in
a
litter
near
the
line
of
battle
had
sent
for
stuart
the
cavalry
commander
however
was
at
some
distance
from
the
field
late
in
the
evening
finding
it
impossible
to
employ
his
command
at
the
front
he
had
been
detached
by
jackson
a
regiment
of
infantry
supporting
him
to
take
and
hold
ely
ford
he
had
already
arrived
within
view
of
a
federal
camp
established
at
that
point
and
was
preparing
to
charge
the
enemy
under
cover
of
the
night
when
hill
messenger
recalled
him
when
stuart
reached
the
front
he
found
the
troops
still
halted
rodes
and
colston
reforming
on
the
open
fields
near
dowdall
tavern
the
light
division
deployed
within
the
forest
and
the
generals
anxious
for
their
own
security
so
far
the
attack
had
been
completely
successful
but
lee
lack
of
strength
prevented
the
full
accomplishment
of
his
design
had
longstreet
been
present
with
pickett
and
hood
to
lead
his
splendid
infantry
the
third
corps
and
the
twelfth
would
have
been
so
hardly
pressed
that
chancellorsville
hazel
grove
and
the
white
house
would
have
fallen
an
easy
prize
to
jackson
bayonets
anderson
with
four
small
brigades
was
powerless
to
hold
the
force
confronting
him
and
marching
rapidly
northwards
sickles
had
reached
hazel
grove
before
jackson
fell
here
pleasonton
with
his
batteries
was
still
in
position
and
hooker
had
not
yet
lost
his
head
as
soon
as
and
whipple
divisions
had
come
up
forming
in
columns
of
brigades
behind
the
guns
sickles
was
ordered
to
assail
the
enemy
right
flank
and
check
his
advance
just
before
midnight
the
attack
was
made
in
two
lines
of
battle
supported
by
strong
columns
the
night
was
very
clear
and
still
the
moon
nearly
full
threw
enough
light
into
the
woods
to
facilitate
the
advance
and
the
tracks
leading
served
as
lines
of
direction
the
attack
however
although
gallantly
made
gained
no
material
advantage
the
preliminary
movements
were
plainly
audible
to
the
confederates
and
lane
brigade
most
of
which
was
now
south
of
the
plank
road
had
made
every
preparation
to
receive
it
against
troops
lying
down
in
the
woods
the
federal
artillery
although
fifty
or
sixty
guns
were
in
action
made
but
small
impression
and
the
dangers
of
a
night
attack
made
upon
troops
who
are
expecting
it
and
whose
morale
is
unaffected
were
forcibly
illustrated
the
confusion
in
the
forest
was
very
great
a
portion
of
the
assailing
force
losing
direction
fell
foul
of
berry
division
at
the
foot
of
the
fairview
heights
which
had
not
been
informed
of
the
movement
and
at
least
two
regiments
fired
into
from
front
and
rear
broke
up
in
panic
some
part
of
the
log
breastworks
which
jackson
advanced
line
had
occupied
were
recaptured
but
not
a
single
one
of
the
assailants
except
as
prisoners
reached
the
plank
road
and
yet
the
attack
was
an
exceedingly
stroke
and
as
such
although
the
losses
were
heavy
had
a
very
considerable
effect
on
the
issue
of
the
fighting
it
showed
or
seemed
to
show
that
the
federals
were
still
in
good
heart
that
they
were
rapidly
concentrating
and
that
the
confederates
might
be
met
by
vigorous
the
fact
said
stuart
in
his
official
dispatch
that
the
attack
was
made
and
at
night
made
me
apprehensive
of
a
repetition
of
it
so
while
jackson
slept
through
the
hours
of
darkness
that
should
have
seen
the
consummation
of
his
enterprise
his
soldiers
lay
beside
their
arms
and
the
federals
digging
felling
and
building
constructed
a
new
line
of
parapet
protected
by
abattis
and
strengthened
by
a
long
array
of
guns
on
the
slopes
of
fairview
and
hazel
grove
the
respite
which
the
fall
of
the
confederate
leader
had
brought
them
was
not
neglected
the
panic
was
stayed
the
first
army
corps
rapidly
crossing
the
rappahannock
secured
the
road
to
the
white
house
and
averell
division
of
cavalry
reached
ely
ford
may
on
the
left
between
chancellorsville
and
the
river
where
a
young
federal
colonel
named
miles
army
handled
his
troops
with
conspicuous
skill
lee
continuous
attacks
had
been
successfully
repulsed
and
at
dawn
on
the
morning
of
may
the
situation
of
the
union
army
was
far
from
unpromising
a
gap
of
nearly
two
miles
intervened
between
the
confederate
wings
and
within
this
gap
on
the
commanding
heights
of
hazel
grove
and
fairview
the
federals
were
strongly
intrenched
an
opportunity
for
dealing
a
crushing
counterblow
for
holding
one
portion
of
lee
army
in
check
while
the
other
was
overwhelmed
appeared
to
present
itself
the
only
question
was
whether
the
morale
of
the
general
and
the
men
could
be
depended
upon
in
stuart
however
hooker
had
to
deal
with
a
soldier
who
was
no
unworthy
successor
of
stonewall
jackson
reluctantly
abandoning
the
idea
of
a
night
attack
the
cavalry
general
fully
alive
to
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
had
determined
to
reduce
the
interval
between
himself
and
lee
and
during
the
night
the
artillery
was
brought
up
to
the
front
and
the
batteries
deployed
wherever
they
could
find
room
just
before
the
darkness
began
to
lift
orders
were
received
from
lee
that
the
assault
was
to
be
made
as
early
as
possible
and
the
right
wing
swinging
round
in
order
to
come
abreast
of
the
centre
became
hotly
engaged
away
to
the
across
the
hills
held
by
the
federals
came
the
responding
thunder
of
lee
guns
and
infantry
advancing
through
the
woods
against
front
and
flank
enveloped
in
a
circle
of
fire
a
stronghold
which
was
held
by
over
muskets
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
minutely
the
events
of
the
morning
the
federal
troops
such
as
were
brought
into
action
fought
well
but
jackson
tremendous
attack
had
already
defeated
hooker
before
sickles
made
his
night
attack
from
hazel
grove
he
had
sent
orders
for
sedgwick
to
move
at
once
occupy
fredericksburg
seize
the
heights
and
march
westward
by
the
plank
road
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
instructed
his
engineers
to
select
and
fortify
a
position
about
a
mile
in
rear
of
chancellorsville
so
when
stuart
pressed
forward
not
only
had
this
new
position
been
occupied
by
the
first
and
fifth
army
corps
but
the
troops
hitherto
in
possession
of
hazel
grove
were
already
evacuating
their
intrenchments
these
dispositions
sufficiently
attest
the
demoralisation
of
the
federal
commander
as
the
historian
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
puts
it
the
movement
to
be
executed
by
sedgwick
was
precisely
one
of
those
movements
which
according
as
they
are
wrought
out
may
be
either
the
height
of
wisdom
or
the
height
of
folly
its
successful
accomplishment
certainly
promised
very
brilliant
results
it
is
easy
to
see
how
seriously
lee
safety
would
be
compromised
if
while
engaged
with
hooker
in
front
he
should
suddenly
find
a
powerful
force
assailing
his
rear
and
grasping
already
his
direct
line
of
communication
with
richmond
but
if
on
the
other
hand
lee
should
be
able
by
any
slackness
on
the
part
of
his
opponent
to
engage
him
in
front
with
a
part
of
his
force
while
he
should
turn
swiftly
round
to
assail
the
isolated
moving
column
it
is
obvious
that
he
would
be
able
to
repulse
or
destroy
that
column
and
then
by
a
vigorous
return
meet
or
attack
his
antagonist
main
body
in
the
successful
execution
of
this
plan
not
only
was
sedgwick
bound
to
the
most
energetic
action
but
hooker
also
was
engaged
by
every
consideration
of
honour
and
duty
to
so
act
as
to
make
the
dangerous
task
he
had
assigned
to
sedgwick
possible
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
pages
to
but
so
far
from
aiding
his
subordinate
by
a
heavy
on
lee
front
hooker
deliberately
abandoned
the
hazel
grove
salient
which
keeping
asunder
the
confederate
wings
strongly
facilitated
such
a
manoeuvre
and
more
than
this
he
divided
his
own
army
into
two
portions
of
which
the
rear
occupying
the
new
position
was
actually
forbidden
to
reinforce
the
front
it
is
possible
that
hooker
contemplated
an
early
retreat
of
his
whole
force
to
the
second
position
if
so
lee
and
stuart
were
too
quick
for
him
the
cavalry
commander
as
soon
as
it
became
light
and
the
hills
and
undulations
of
the
wilderness
emerged
from
the
shadows
immediately
recognised
the
importance
of
hazel
grove
the
hill
was
quickly
seized
thirty
pieces
of
artillery
established
on
the
crest
enfiladed
the
federal
batteries
facing
west
on
the
heights
of
fairview
and
the
brigade
on
stuart
extreme
right
was
soon
in
touch
with
the
troops
directed
by
general
lee
then
against
the
three
sides
of
the
federal
position
the
battle
raged
from
the
south
and
came
anderson
and
mclaws
the
batteries
unlimbering
on
every
eminence
and
the
infantry
hitherto
held
back
attacking
with
the
vigour
which
their
gallant
commanders
knew
so
well
how
to
inspire
and
from
the
west
formed
in
three
lines
hill
division
to
the
front
came
the
second
army
corps
the
men
knew
by
this
time
that
the
leader
whom
they
trusted
beyond
all
others
had
been
struck
down
that
he
was
lying
wounded
helpless
far
away
in
rear
yet
his
spirit
was
still
with
them
stuart
galloping
along
the
ranks
recalled
him
with
ringing
words
to
their
memories
and
as
the
bugles
sounded
the
onset
it
was
with
a
cry
of
remember
jackson
that
his
soldiers
rushed
fiercely
upon
the
federal
breastworks
the
advanced
line
within
the
forest
was
taken
at
the
first
rush
the
second
at
the
foot
of
the
fairview
heights
protected
by
a
swampy
stream
a
broad
belt
of
abattis
and
with
thirty
guns
on
the
hill
behind
proved
far
more
formidable
and
hill
division
was
forced
back
but
rodes
and
colston
were
in
close
support
the
fight
was
speedily
renewed
and
then
came
charge
and
the
storm
of
the
parapets
the
rally
of
the
defenders
the
rush
with
the
bayonet
and
mowing
down
men
like
grass
the
fearful
sweep
of
case
and
canister
twice
the
confederates
were
repulsed
twice
they
reformed
brigade
mingled
with
brigade
regiment
with
regiment
and
charged
again
in
the
teeth
of
the
thirty
guns
on
both
sides
ammunition
began
to
fail
the
brushwood
took
fire
the
ground
became
hot
beneath
the
foot
and
many
wounded
perished
miserably
in
the
flames
yet
still
with
the
tangled
abattis
dividing
the
opposing
lines
the
fight
went
on
both
sides
struggling
fiercely
the
federals
with
the
advantage
of
position
the
confederates
of
numbers
for
hooker
refused
to
reinforce
his
gallant
troops
at
length
the
guns
which
stuart
had
established
on
hazel
grove
crossing
their
fire
with
those
of
mclaws
and
anderson
gained
the
upper
hand
over
the
union
batteries
the
storm
of
shell
sweeping
the
fairview
plateau
took
the
breastworks
in
reverse
the
northern
infantry
after
five
hours
of
such
hot
battle
as
few
fields
have
witnessed
began
sullenly
to
yield
and
as
stuart
leading
the
last
charge
leapt
his
horse
over
the
parapet
the
works
were
evacuated
and
the
tattered
colours
of
the
confederates
waved
in
triumph
on
the
hill
the
scene
says
a
can
never
be
effaced
from
the
minds
of
those
that
witnessed
it
the
troops
were
pressing
forward
with
all
the
ardour
and
enthusiasm
of
combat
the
white
smoke
of
musketry
fringed
the
front
of
battle
while
the
artillery
on
the
hills
in
rear
shook
the
earth
with
its
thunder
and
filled
the
air
with
the
wild
shrieking
of
the
shells
that
plunged
into
the
masses
of
the
retreating
foe
to
add
greater
horror
and
sublimity
to
the
scene
the
chancellorsville
house
and
the
woods
surrounding
it
were
wrapped
in
flames
it
was
then
that
general
lee
rode
to
the
front
of
his
advancing
battalions
his
presence
was
the
signal
for
one
of
those
uncontrollable
of
enthusiasm
which
none
can
appreciate
who
have
not
witnessed
them
the
fierce
soldiers
with
their
faces
blackened
with
the
smoke
of
battle
the
wounded
crawling
with
feeble
limbs
from
the
fury
of
the
devouring
flames
all
seemed
possessed
of
a
common
impulse
one
long
unbroken
cheer
in
which
the
feeble
cry
of
those
who
lay
helpless
on
the
earth
blended
with
the
strong
voices
of
those
who
still
fought
hailed
the
presence
of
the
victorious
chief
his
first
care
was
for
the
wounded
of
both
armies
and
he
was
among
the
foremost
at
the
burning
mansion
where
some
of
them
lay
but
at
that
moment
when
the
transports
of
his
troops
were
drowning
the
roar
of
battle
with
acclamations
a
note
was
brought
to
him
from
general
jackson
it
was
handed
to
him
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
near
the
chancellorsville
house
and
unable
to
open
it
with
his
gauntleted
hands
he
passed
it
to
me
with
directions
to
read
it
to
him
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
pain
and
anguish
that
passed
over
his
face
as
he
listened
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
he
bade
me
say
to
general
jackson
that
the
victory
was
his
i
do
not
know
how
others
may
regard
this
incident
but
for
myself
as
i
gave
expression
to
the
thoughts
of
his
exalted
mind
i
forgot
the
genius
that
won
the
day
in
my
reverence
for
the
generosity
that
refused
its
glory
lee
reply
ran
general
i
have
just
received
your
note
informing
me
that
you
were
wounded
i
can
not
express
my
regret
at
the
occurrence
could
i
have
directed
events
i
should
have
chosen
for
the
good
of
the
country
to
be
disabled
in
your
stead
i
congratulate
you
upon
the
victory
which
is
due
to
your
skill
and
energy
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
lee
general
such
was
the
tribute
not
the
less
valued
that
it
was
couched
in
no
exaggerated
terms
which
was
brought
to
the
bedside
in
the
quiet
hospital
jackson
was
almost
alone
as
the
sound
of
cannon
and
musketry
borne
across
the
forest
grew
gradually
louder
he
had
ordered
all
those
who
had
remained
with
him
except
smith
to
return
to
the
and
attend
to
their
different
duties
his
side
injured
by
his
fall
from
the
litter
gave
him
much
pain
but
his
thoughts
were
still
clear
and
his
speech
coherent
general
lee
he
said
when
his
read
to
him
the
brief
words
is
very
kind
but
he
should
give
the
praise
to
god
during
the
day
the
pain
gradually
ceased
the
general
grew
brighter
and
from
those
who
visited
the
hospital
he
inquired
minutely
about
the
battle
and
the
troops
engaged
when
conspicuous
instances
of
courage
were
related
his
face
lit
up
with
enthusiasm
and
he
uttered
his
usual
good
good
with
unwonted
energy
when
the
gallant
behaviour
of
his
old
command
was
alluded
to
some
day
he
said
the
men
of
that
brigade
will
be
proud
to
say
to
their
children
i
was
one
of
the
stonewall
brigade
he
disclaimed
all
right
of
his
own
to
the
name
stonewall
it
belongs
to
the
brigade
and
not
to
me
that
night
he
slept
well
and
was
free
from
pain
meanwhile
the
confederate
army
resting
on
the
heights
of
chancellorsville
preparatory
to
an
attack
upon
hooker
second
stronghold
had
received
untoward
news
sedgwick
at
eleven
in
the
morning
had
carried
marye
hill
and
driving
early
before
him
was
moving
up
the
plank
road
wilcox
brigade
of
division
then
at
banks
ford
was
ordered
to
retard
the
advance
of
the
hostile
column
mclaws
was
detached
to
salem
church
the
second
army
corps
and
the
rest
of
anderson
division
remained
to
hold
hooker
in
check
and
for
the
moment
operations
at
chancellorsville
were
suspended
mclaws
deploying
his
troops
in
the
forest
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
a
wide
expanse
of
cleared
ground
pushed
his
skirmishers
forward
to
the
edge
and
awaited
the
attack
of
a
superior
force
reserving
his
fire
to
close
quarters
its
effect
was
fearful
but
the
federals
pushed
forward
a
occupied
as
an
advanced
post
was
captured
and
at
this
point
sedgwick
was
within
an
ace
of
breaking
through
his
second
line
however
had
not
yet
deployed
and
a
vigorous
counterstroke
delivered
by
two
brigades
drove
back
the
whole
of
his
leading
division
in
great
disorder
as
night
fell
the
confederates
careful
not
to
expose
themselves
to
the
union
reserves
retired
to
the
forest
and
sedgwick
like
hooker
abandoned
all
further
idea
of
offensive
action
the
next
morning
lee
himself
with
the
three
remaining
brigades
of
anderson
arrived
upon
the
scene
sedgwick
who
had
lost
men
the
preceding
day
may
had
fortified
a
position
covering
banks
ford
and
occupied
it
with
over
muskets
lee
with
the
divisions
of
mclaws
anderson
and
early
was
slightly
stronger
the
attack
was
delayed
for
the
federals
held
strong
ground
difficult
to
reconnoitre
but
once
begun
the
issue
was
soon
decided
assailed
in
front
and
flanks
with
no
help
coming
from
hooker
and
only
a
single
bridge
at
banks
ford
in
rear
the
federals
rapidly
gave
ground
darkness
however
intensified
by
a
thick
fog
made
pursuit
difficult
and
sedgwick
the
river
with
many
casualties
but
in
good
order
during
these
operations
that
is
from
four
on
sunday
afternoon
until
after
midnight
on
monday
hooker
had
not
moved
a
single
man
to
his
subordinate
assistance
it
is
but
fair
however
to
state
that
hooker
during
the
cannonade
which
preceded
the
final
assault
at
chancellorsville
had
been
severely
bruised
by
a
fall
of
masonry
so
extraordinary
a
situation
has
seldom
been
seen
in
war
an
army
of
men
strongly
fortified
was
held
in
check
for
hours
by
while
not
seven
miles
away
raged
a
battle
on
which
the
whole
fate
of
the
campaign
depended
lee
and
jackson
had
made
no
false
estimate
of
hooker
incapacity
sedgwick
army
corps
had
suffered
so
severely
in
men
and
in
moral
that
it
was
not
available
for
immediate
service
even
had
it
been
transferred
to
chancellorsville
and
lee
was
now
free
to
concentrate
his
whole
force
against
the
main
body
of
the
federal
army
his
men
notwithstanding
their
extraordinary
exertions
were
confident
of
victory
may
as
i
sheltered
myself
says
an
in
a
little
farmhouse
on
the
plank
road
the
brigades
of
anderson
division
came
splashing
through
the
mud
in
wild
tumultuous
spirits
singing
shouting
jesting
heedless
of
soaking
rags
drenched
to
the
skin
and
burning
again
to
mingle
in
the
mad
revelry
of
battle
hon
francis
lawley
the
times
june
but
it
was
impossible
to
push
forward
for
a
violent
burst
upon
the
wilderness
and
the
spongy
soil
saturated
with
the
deluge
absolutely
precluded
all
movement
across
country
hooker
who
had
already
made
preparations
for
retreat
took
advantage
of
the
weather
and
as
soon
as
darkness
set
in
put
his
army
in
motion
for
the
bridges
may
by
eight
on
the
morning
of
the
the
whole
force
had
crossed
and
when
the
confederate
patrols
pushed
forward
lee
found
that
his
victim
had
escaped
the
army
of
the
potomac
returned
to
its
old
camp
on
the
hills
above
fredericksburg
and
lee
reoccupied
his
position
on
the
opposite
ridge
stoneman
who
had
scoured
the
whole
country
to
within
a
few
miles
of
richmond
returned
to
kelly
ford
on
may
the
raid
had
effected
nothing
the
damage
done
to
the
railroads
and
canals
was
repaired
by
the
time
the
raiders
had
regained
the
rappahannock
operations
at
chancellorsville
had
not
been
affected
in
the
very
slightest
degree
by
their
presence
in
his
rear
while
absence
had
proved
the
ruin
of
the
federal
army
jackson
who
had
been
removed
by
the
order
to
house
near
gurney
station
on
the
morning
of
may
was
asked
what
he
thought
of
hooker
plan
of
campaign
his
reply
was
it
was
in
the
main
a
good
conception
an
excellent
plan
but
he
should
not
have
sent
away
his
cavalry
that
was
his
great
blunder
it
was
that
which
enabled
me
to
turn
him
without
his
being
aware
of
it
and
to
take
him
in
the
rear
had
he
kept
his
cavalry
with
him
his
plan
would
have
been
a
very
good
one
this
was
not
his
only
comment
on
the
great
battle
among
other
things
he
said
that
he
intended
to
cut
the
federals
off
from
the
united
states
ford
and
taking
a
position
between
them
and
the
river
oblige
them
to
attack
him
adding
with
a
smile
my
men
sometimes
fail
to
drive
the
enemy
from
a
position
but
they
always
fail
to
drive
us
away
he
spoke
of
general
rodes
and
alluded
in
high
terms
to
his
splendid
behaviour
in
the
attack
on
howard
he
hoped
he
would
be
promoted
and
he
said
that
promotion
should
be
made
at
once
upon
the
field
so
as
to
act
as
an
incentive
to
gallantry
in
others
he
spoke
of
colonel
willis
who
had
commanded
the
skirmishers
and
praised
him
very
highly
and
referred
most
feelingly
to
the
death
of
paxton
the
commander
of
the
stonewall
brigade
and
of
captain
boswell
his
chief
engineer
in
speaking
of
his
own
share
in
the
victory
he
said
our
movement
was
a
great
success
i
think
the
most
successful
military
movement
of
my
life
but
i
expect
to
receive
far
more
credit
for
it
than
i
deserve
most
men
will
think
i
planned
it
all
from
the
first
but
it
was
not
so
i
simply
took
advantage
of
circumstances
as
they
were
presented
to
me
in
the
providence
of
god
i
feel
that
his
hand
led
me
let
us
give
him
the
glory
it
must
always
be
an
interesting
matter
of
speculation
what
the
result
would
have
been
had
jackson
accomplished
his
design
on
the
night
he
fell
of
moving
a
large
part
of
his
command
up
the
white
house
road
and
barring
the
only
line
of
retreat
left
open
to
the
federals
hooker
it
is
argued
had
two
corps
in
position
which
had
been
hardly
engaged
the
second
and
the
fifth
and
another
the
first
under
reynolds
was
coming
up
of
these
men
might
possibly
could
they
have
been
manoeuvred
in
the
forest
have
been
sent
to
drive
jackson
back
and
undoubtedly
to
those
who
think
more
of
numbers
than
of
human
nature
of
the
momentum
of
the
mass
rather
than
the
mental
equilibrium
of
the
general
the
fact
that
a
superior
force
of
comparatively
fresh
troops
was
at
hooker
disposal
will
be
sufficient
to
put
the
success
of
the
confederates
out
of
court
yet
the
question
will
always
suggest
itself
would
not
the
report
that
a
victorious
enemy
of
unknown
strength
was
pressing
forward
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
towards
the
only
line
of
retreat
have
so
demoralised
the
federal
commander
and
the
federal
soldiers
already
shaken
by
the
overthrow
of
the
eleventh
army
corps
that
they
would
have
thought
only
of
securing
their
own
safety
would
hooker
whose
tactics
the
next
day
after
he
had
had
the
night
given
him
in
which
to
recover
his
senses
were
so
inadequate
have
done
better
if
he
had
received
no
respite
would
the
soldiers
of
the
three
army
corps
not
yet
engaged
who
had
been
witnesses
of
the
rout
of
divisions
have
fared
better
when
they
heard
the
triumphant
yells
of
the
advancing
confederates
than
the
hapless
germans
the
wounding
of
jackson
says
a
most
careful
historian
of
the
battle
himself
a
participator
in
the
union
disaster
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
for
the
army
of
the
potomac
at
nine
the
capture
or
destruction
of
a
large
part
of
the
army
seemed
inevitable
there
was
at
the
time
great
uncertainty
and
a
feeling
akin
to
panic
prevailing
among
the
union
forces
round
chancellorsville
and
when
we
consider
the
position
of
the
troops
at
this
moment
and
how
many
important
battles
have
been
won
by
trivial
flank
attacks
how
richepanse
attacking
through
the
forest
with
a
single
brigade
ruined
the
austrians
at
hohenlinden
we
must
admit
that
the
northern
army
was
in
great
peril
when
jackson
arrived
within
one
thousand
yards
of
its
vital
point
the
white
house
with
men
and
cannon
chancellorsville
hamlin
he
must
be
a
great
leader
indeed
who
when
his
flank
is
suddenly
rolled
up
and
his
line
of
retreat
threatened
preserves
sufficient
coolness
to
devise
a
general
counterstroke
jackson
had
proved
himself
equal
to
such
a
situation
at
cedar
run
but
it
is
seldom
in
these
circumstances
that
providence
sides
with
the
big
battalions
the
federal
losses
in
the
six
days
battles
were
heavy
over
at
chancellorsville
and
at
fredericksburg
salem
church
and
banks
ford
a
total
of
the
army
lost
guns
and
nearly
officers
and
men
were
reported
either
captured
or
missing
the
casualties
were
distributed
as
follows
first
army
corps
second
third
fifth
sixth
eleventh
twelfth
pleasonton
cavalry
brigade
the
confederate
losses
were
hardly
less
severe
the
killed
and
wounded
were
as
under
second
army
corps
hill
division
rodes
colston
early
anderson
mclaws
artillery
cavalry
prisoners
estimated
but
a
mere
statement
of
the
casualties
by
no
means
represents
the
comparative
loss
of
the
opposing
forces
victory
does
not
consist
in
merely
killing
and
maiming
a
few
thousand
men
this
is
the
visible
result
it
is
the
invisible
that
tells
the
army
of
the
potomac
when
it
retreated
across
the
rappahannock
was
far
stronger
in
mere
numbers
than
the
army
of
northern
virginia
but
in
reality
it
was
far
weaker
for
the
moral
of
the
survivors
and
of
the
general
who
led
them
was
terribly
affected
that
of
the
confederates
on
the
other
hand
had
been
sensibly
elevated
and
it
is
moral
not
numbers
which
is
the
strength
of
armies
what
after
all
was
the
loss
of
soldiers
to
the
confederacy
in
that
first
week
of
may
there
were
probably
conscripts
in
different
camps
of
instruction
more
than
enough
to
recruit
the
depleted
regiments
to
full
strength
nor
did
the
slaughter
of
chancellorsville
diminish
to
any
appreciable
degree
the
vast
hosts
of
the
union
and
yet
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
lost
more
than
all
the
efforts
of
the
government
could
replace
the
army
of
virginia
on
the
other
hand
had
acquired
a
superiority
of
spirit
which
was
ample
compensation
for
the
sacrifice
which
had
been
made
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
lee
force
had
gained
from
the
victory
an
increase
of
strength
equivalent
to
a
whole
army
corps
of
men
while
that
of
his
opponent
had
been
proportionately
diminished
why
then
was
there
no
pursuit
it
has
been
asserted
that
lee
was
so
crippled
by
his
losses
at
chancellorsville
that
he
was
unable
to
resume
operations
against
hooker
for
a
whole
month
this
explanation
of
his
inactivity
can
hardly
be
accepted
on
june
and
at
and
waterloo
the
army
little
larger
than
that
of
northern
virginia
lost
men
and
yet
on
the
wellington
was
marching
in
pursuit
of
the
french
nor
did
he
halt
until
he
arrived
within
sight
of
paris
and
on
august
and
at
groveton
and
the
second
manassas
stonewall
jackson
lost
officers
and
men
of
his
force
but
he
was
not
left
in
rear
when
lee
invaded
maryland
moreover
after
he
had
defeated
sedgwick
on
the
same
night
that
hooker
was
recrossing
the
rappahannock
lee
was
planning
a
final
attack
on
the
federal
intrenchments
and
his
disappointment
was
bitter
when
he
learned
that
his
enemy
had
escaped
if
his
men
were
capable
of
further
efforts
on
the
night
of
may
they
were
capable
of
them
the
next
day
and
it
was
neither
the
ravages
of
battle
nor
the
disorganisation
of
the
army
that
held
the
confederates
fast
but
the
deficiency
of
supplies
the
damage
done
to
the
railways
by
stoneman
horsemen
the
weakness
of
the
cavalry
and
principally
the
hesitation
of
the
government
after
the
victory
of
chancellorsville
strong
hopes
of
peace
were
entertained
in
the
south
before
hooker
advanced
a
large
section
of
the
northern
democrats
despairing
of
ultimate
success
had
once
more
raised
the
cry
that
immediate
separation
was
better
than
a
hopeless
contest
involving
such
awful
sacrifices
and
it
needed
all
strength
to
stem
the
tide
of
disaffection
the
existence
of
this
despondent
feeling
was
well
known
to
the
southern
statesmen
and
to
such
an
extent
did
they
count
upon
its
growth
and
increase
that
they
had
overlooked
altogether
the
importance
of
improving
a
victory
should
the
army
be
successful
so
now
when
the
chance
had
come
they
were
neither
ready
to
forward
such
an
enterprise
nor
could
they
make
up
their
minds
to
depart
from
their
passive
attitude
but
to
postpone
all
idea
of
counterstroke
until
some
indefinite
period
is
as
fatal
in
strategy
as
in
tactics
by
no
means
an
uncommon
policy
it
has
been
responsible
for
the
loss
of
a
thousand
opportunities
had
not
politics
intervened
a
vigorous
pursuit
not
necessarily
involving
an
immediate
attack
but
drawing
hooker
as
pope
had
been
drawn
in
the
preceding
august
into
an
unfavourable
situation
before
his
army
had
had
time
to
recover
would
have
probably
been
initiated
it
may
be
questioned
however
whether
general
lee
even
when
longstreet
and
his
divisions
joined
him
would
have
been
so
strong
as
he
had
been
at
the
end
of
april
none
felt
more
deeply
than
the
that
the
absence
of
jackson
was
an
irreparable
misfortune
give
him
my
affectionate
regards
he
said
to
an
who
was
riding
to
the
hospital
tell
him
to
make
haste
and
get
well
and
come
back
to
me
as
soon
as
he
can
he
has
lost
his
left
arm
but
i
have
lost
my
right
any
victory
he
wrote
privately
would
be
dear
at
such
a
price
i
know
not
how
to
replace
him
his
words
were
prophetic
exactly
two
months
after
chancellorsville
the
armies
met
once
more
in
the
clash
of
battle
during
the
first
two
days
on
the
rolling
plain
round
gettysburg
a
village
of
pennsylvania
four
federal
army
corps
were
beaten
in
succession
but
ere
the
sun
set
on
the
third
lee
had
to
admit
defeat
and
yet
his
soldiers
had
displayed
the
same
fiery
courage
and
stubborn
persistence
which
had
carried
them
victorious
through
the
wilderness
but
his
right
arm
had
not
yet
been
replaced
if
he
said
after
the
war
with
unaccustomed
emphasis
i
had
had
jackson
at
gettysburg
i
should
have
won
the
battle
and
a
complete
victory
there
would
have
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
southern
independence
it
was
not
to
be
chancellorsville
where
men
were
defeated
by
is
up
to
a
certain
point
as
much
the
tactical
masterpiece
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
was
leuthen
of
the
eighteenth
but
splendid
triumph
as
it
was
the
battle
bore
no
abiding
fruits
and
the
reason
seems
very
clear
the
voice
that
would
have
urged
pursuit
was
silent
jackson
fall
left
lee
alone
bereft
of
his
alter
ego
with
none
save
stuart
to
whom
he
could
entrust
the
execution
of
those
daring
and
delicate
manoeuvres
his
inferior
numbers
rendered
necessary
with
none
on
whose
resource
and
energy
he
could
implicitly
rely
who
shall
say
how
far
his
own
resolution
had
been
animated
and
confirmed
at
other
crises
by
the
prompting
and
presence
of
the
kindred
spirit
they
supplemented
each
other
said
davis
and
together
with
any
fair
opportunity
they
were
absolutely
invincible
many
a
fierce
battle
still
lay
before
the
army
of
northern
virginia
marvellous
was
the
skill
and
audacity
with
which
lee
manoeuvred
his
ragged
regiments
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
odds
fierce
and
unyielding
were
the
soldiers
but
with
stonewall
jackson
death
the
impulse
of
victory
died
away
may
it
is
needless
to
linger
over
the
closing
scene
at
gurney
station
for
some
days
there
was
hope
that
the
patient
would
recover
pneumonia
attributed
to
his
fall
from
the
litter
as
he
was
borne
from
the
field
supervened
and
he
gradually
began
to
sink
on
the
thursday
his
wife
and
child
arrived
from
richmond
but
he
was
then
almost
too
weak
for
conversation
and
on
sunday
morning
it
was
evident
that
the
end
was
near
may
as
yet
he
had
scarcely
realised
his
condition
if
he
said
it
was
god
will
he
was
ready
to
go
but
he
believed
that
there
was
still
work
for
him
to
do
and
that
his
life
would
be
preserved
to
do
it
at
eleven
jackson
knelt
by
his
side
and
told
him
that
he
could
not
live
beyond
the
evening
you
are
frightened
my
child
he
replied
death
is
not
so
near
i
may
yet
get
well
she
fell
upon
the
bed
weeping
bitterly
and
told
him
again
that
there
was
no
hope
after
a
moment
pause
he
asked
her
to
call
mcguire
doctor
he
said
anna
tells
me
i
am
to
die
is
it
so
when
he
was
answered
he
remained
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
as
if
in
intense
thought
and
then
quietly
replied
very
good
very
good
it
is
all
right
about
noon
when
major
pendleton
came
into
the
room
he
asked
who
is
preaching
at
headquarters
he
was
told
that
lacy
was
and
that
the
whole
army
was
praying
for
him
thank
god
he
said
they
are
very
kind
to
me
already
his
strength
was
fast
ebbing
and
although
his
face
brightened
when
his
baby
was
brought
to
him
his
mind
had
begun
to
wander
now
he
was
on
the
giving
orders
to
his
men
now
at
home
in
lexington
now
at
prayers
in
the
camp
occasionally
his
senses
came
back
to
him
and
about
one
he
was
told
that
he
had
but
two
hours
to
live
again
he
answered
feebly
but
firmly
very
good
it
is
all
right
these
were
almost
his
last
coherent
words
for
some
time
he
lay
unconscious
and
then
suddenly
he
cried
out
order
hill
to
prepare
for
action
pass
the
infantry
to
the
front
tell
major
hawks
then
stopped
leaving
the
sentence
unfinished
once
more
he
was
silent
but
a
little
while
after
he
said
very
quietly
and
clearly
let
us
cross
over
the
river
and
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
the
soul
of
the
great

note
from
general
lee
lexington
virginia
january
jackson
my
dear
jackson
brown
handed
me
your
note
of
the
when
in
richmond
on
business
connected
with
washington
college
i
have
delayed
replying
since
my
return
hoping
to
have
sufficient
time
to
comply
with
your
request
last
night
i
received
a
note
from
brown
enclosing
one
from
dabney
stating
that
the
immediate
return
of
his
manuscript
was
necessary
i
have
not
been
able
to
open
it
and
when
i
read
it
when
you
were
here
it
was
for
the
pleasure
of
the
narrative
with
no
view
of
remark
or
correction
and
i
took
no
memoranda
of
what
seemed
to
be
errors
i
have
not
thought
of
them
since
and
do
not
know
that
i
can
now
recall
them
and
certainly
have
no
desire
that
my
opinions
should
be
adopted
in
preference
to
dr
dabney
i
am
however
unable
at
this
time
to
specify
the
battles
to
which
my
remark
particularly
refers
the
opinion
of
general
jackson
in
reference
to
the
propriety
of
attacking
the
federal
army
under
general
mcclellan
at
harrison
landing
is
not
i
think
correctly
stated
upon
my
arrival
there
the
day
after
general
longstreet
and
himself
i
was
disappointed
that
no
opportunity
for
striking
general
mcclellan
on
the
retreat
or
in
his
then
position
had
occurred
and
went
forward
with
general
jackson
alone
on
foot
and
after
a
careful
reconnaissance
of
the
whole
line
and
position
he
certainly
stated
to
me
at
that
time
the
impropriety
of
attacking
i
am
misrepresented
at
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
in
proposing
an
attack
in
front
the
first
evening
of
our
arrival
on
the
contrary
i
decided
against
it
and
stated
to
general
jackson
we
must
attack
on
our
left
as
soon
as
practicable
and
the
necessary
movement
of
the
troops
began
immediately
in
consequence
of
a
report
received
about
that
time
from
general
fitzhugh
lee
describing
the
position
of
the
federal
army
and
the
roads
which
he
held
with
his
cavalry
leading
to
its
rear
general
jackson
after
some
inquiry
concerning
the
roads
leading
to
the
furnace
undertook
to
throw
his
command
entirely
in
hooker
rear
which
he
accomplished
with
equal
skill
and
boldness
the
rest
of
the
army
being
moved
to
the
left
flank
to
connect
with
him
as
he
advanced
i
think
there
is
some
mistake
too
of
a
regiment
of
infantry
being
sent
by
him
to
the
ford
on
the
rapidan
as
described
by
dabney
the
cavalry
was
ordered
to
make
such
a
demonstration
general
stuart
had
proceeded
to
that
part
of
the
field
to
in
general
jackson
movement
and
i
always
supposed
it
was
his
dismounted
cavalry
as
well
as
i
now
recollect
something
is
said
by
dabney
as
to
general
jackson
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
of
delivering
battle
at
sharpsburg
when
he
came
upon
the
field
having
preceded
his
troops
and
learned
my
reasons
for
offering
battle
he
emphatically
concurred
with
me
when
i
determined
to
withdraw
across
the
potomac
he
also
concurred
but
said
then
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
it
was
better
to
have
fought
the
battle
in
maryland
than
to
have
left
it
without
a
struggle
after
crossing
the
potomac
general
jackson
was
charged
with
the
command
of
the
rear
and
he
designated
the
brigades
of
infantry
to
support
pendleton
batteries
i
believed
general
mcclellan
had
been
so
crippled
at
sharpsburg
that
he
could
not
follow
the
confederate
army
into
virginia
immediately
but
general
stuart
was
ordered
after
crossing
the
potomac
to
recross
at
once
at
williamsport
threaten
his
right
flank
and
observe
his
movements
near
daylight
the
next
morning
general
pendleton
reported
to
me
the
occurrence
at
shepherdstown
the
previous
evening
and
stated
that
he
had
made
a
similar
report
to
general
jackson
who
was
lying
near
me
on
the
same
field
from
his
statement
i
thought
it
possible
that
the
federal
army
might
be
attempting
to
follow
us
and
i
sent
at
once
to
general
jackson
to
say
that
in
that
event
i
would
attack
it
that
he
must
return
with
his
whole
command
if
necessary
that
i
had
sent
to
longstreet
to
countermarch
the
rest
of
the
army
and
that
upon
his
joining
me
unless
i
heard
from
him
to
the
contrary
i
should
move
with
it
to
his
support
general
jackson
went
back
with
division
general
pendleton
accompanying
him
and
soon
drove
the
federals
into
maryland
with
loss
his
report
which
i
received
on
my
way
towards
the
river
relieved
my
anxiety
and
the
order
of
the
march
of
the
troops
was
again
resumed
i
have
endeavoured
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
in
my
statement
and
with
the
single
object
of
calling
dabney
attention
to
the
points
referred
to
that
he
may
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
correctness
of
his
own
statements
and
this
has
been
done
solely
in
compliance
with
your
request
other
points
may
have
attracted
my
attention
in
the
perusal
of
the
narrative
but
i
can
not
now
recall
them
and
do
not
know
that
those
which
have
occurred
to
me
are
of
importance
i
wish
i
could
do
anything
to
give
real
assistance
for
i
am
very
anxious
that
his
work
should
be
perfect
with
feelings
of
great
esteem
and
regard
i
am
very
truly

note
the
following
details
communicated
to
the
author
by
one
of
generals
as
to
the
formations
of
the
confederate
infantry
will
be
found
interesting
our
brigades
were
usually
formed
of
four
or
five
regiments
each
regiment
composed
of
ten
companies
troops
furnished
by
the
same
state
were
as
far
as
possible
brigaded
together
in
order
to
stimulate
state
pride
and
a
spirit
of
healthy
emulation
the
regiment
was
formed
for
attack
in
line
covered
by
skirmishers
the
number
of
skirmishers
and
the
intervals
between
the
men
on
the
skirmish
line
depended
altogether
on
the
situation
sometimes
two
companies
were
extended
as
skirmishers
sometimes
one
company
sometimes
a
certain
number
of
men
from
several
companies
in
rear
of
the
skirmishers
at
a
distance
ranging
from
three
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
paces
came
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
when
a
regiment
or
a
brigade
advanced
through
a
heavily
wooded
country
such
as
the
wilderness
the
point
of
direction
was
established
and
the
officers
instructed
to
conform
to
the
movements
of
the
company
or
regiment
as
the
case
might
be
the
company
or
regiment
governing
both
direction
and
alignment
the
maintenance
of
direction
under
such
circumstances
was
a
very
difficult
matter
our
officers
however
were
greatly
assisted
by
the
rank
and
file
as
many
of
the
latter
were
accomplished
woodsmen
and
accustomed
to
hunt
and
shoot
in
the
dense
forests
of
the
south
each
regiment
moreover
was
provided
with
a
right
and
a
left
guide
men
selected
for
their
special
aptitudes
being
good
judges
of
distance
and
noted
for
their
steadiness
and
skill
in
maintaining
the
direction
then
again
the
line
of
battle
was
greatly
aided
in
maintaining
the
direction
by
the
fire
of
the
skirmishers
and
frequently
the
line
would
be
formed
with
a
flank
resting
on
a
trail
or
a
ravine
or
watercourse
the
flank
regiment
in
such
cases
acting
as
the
guide
at
chancellorsville
jackson
divisions
kept
direction
by
the
turnpike
both
wings
looking
to
the
centre
in
advancing
through
thick
woods
the
skirmish
line
was
almost
invariably
strengthened
and
while
the
of
battle
covered
by
the
skirmishers
advanced
in
line
bodies
in
rear
usually
marched
in
columns
of
fours
prepared
to
come
by
a
into
line
to
the
point
where
their
assistance
might
be
desired
i
never
saw
the
compass
used
in
in
all
movements
to
attack
it
was
the
universal
custom
for
the
brigade
commander
to
assemble
both
field
and
company
officers
to
the
and
centre
and
instruct
them
particularly
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
movement
the
method
in
which
it
was
to
be
carried
out
the
point
of
direction
the
guide
regiment
the
position
of
other
brigades
etc
like
action
was
also
taken
by
the
regimental
commander
when
a
regiment
was
alone
this
precaution
i
venture
to
think
is
absolutely
indispensable
to
an
orderly
and
combined
advance
over
any
ground
whatever
and
so
far
as
my
knowledge
goes
was
seldom
omitted
except
when
haste
was
imperative
in
the
army
of
northern
virginia
practical
experience
taught
us
that
no
movement
should
be
permitted
until
every
officer
was
acquainted
with
the
object
in
view
and
had
received
his
instructions
i
may
add
that
brigade
and
regimental
commanders
were
most
particular
to
secure
their
flanks
and
to
keep
contact
with
other
troops
by
means
of
patrols
and
also
that
in
thick
woods
it
was
found
to
be
of
very
great
advantage
if
a
few
trustworthy
men
were
detailed
as
orderlies
to
the
regimental
commander
for
by
this
means
he
could
most
easily
control

the

became

instrument
after

over

over
again
it
failed
to
respond
to

of

and
the
failure
was
not

but
to
the

loyal

valiant
as
they
were

not
one

could

say
as
he
had
said
of
jackson
such
an
executive
officer
the
sun
never
shone

i
have
but
to
show
him
my
design
and
i
know
that
if
it
can
be
done
it
will
be
done
no
need
for
me
to
send
or
watch
him
straight
as

advances

the
execution
of
my
purpose
hon
francis
lawley
the
times
june
these
words
have
been
quoted
as
an
epitome
of
jackson
military
character
he
was
essentially
says
swinton
an
executive
officer
and
in
that
sphere
he
was
incomparable
but
he
was
devoid
of
high
mental
parts
and
destitute
of
that
power
of
planning
a
combination
and
of
that
calm
broad
military
intelligence
which
distinguished
general
lee
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
page
and
this
verdict
except
in
the
south
has
been
generally
accepted
yet
it
rests
on
a
most
unsubstantial
basis
because
jackson
knew
so
well
how
to
obey
it
is
asserted
that
he
was
not
well
fitted
for
independent
command
because
he
could
carry
out
orders
to
the
letter
it
is
assumed
that
he
was
no
master
of
strategy
because
his
will
was
of
iron
and
his
purpose
once
fixed
never
for
a
moment
wavered
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
his
mental
scope
was
narrow
because
he
was
silent
in
council
not
eager
in
expressing
his
ideas
and
averse
to
argument
it
is
implied
that
his
opinions
on
matters
of
great
moment
were
not
worth
the
hearing
because
he
was
shy
and
unassuming
because
he
betrayed
neither
in
face
nor
bearing
save
in
the
heat
of
battle
any
unusual
power
or
consciousness
of
power
it
is
hastily
concluded
that
he
was
deficient
in
the
initiative
the
breadth
and
the
penetration
which
are
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
great
generals
in
these
pages
however
it
has
been
made
clear
that
jackson
quiet
demeanour
concealed
a
vivid
imagination
a
fertile
brain
and
an
extraordinary
capacity
for
combinations
after
he
had
once
made
up
his
mind
when
and
where
to
strike
it
is
true
that
his
methods
of
war
were
very
simple
and
his
blows
those
of
a
sledgehammer
but
simplicity
of
design
and
vigour
of
execution
are
often
marks
of
the
very
highest
military
ability
genius
says
napier
is
not
extravagant
it
is
ardent
and
it
conceives
great
projects
but
it
knows
beforehand
how
to
attain
the
result
and
it
uses
the
simplest
means
because
its
faculties
are
essentially
calculating
industrious
and
patient
it
is
creative
because
its
knowledge
is
vast
it
is
quick
and
peremptory
not
because
it
is
presumptuous
but
because
it
is
and
swinton
verdict
would
have
been
approved
by
few
of
the
soldiers
of
the
civil
war
it
was
not
the
verdict
of
lee
significant
indeed
was
the
cry
of
the
great
confederate
the
soul
of
truth
as
of
generosity
when
jackson
was
wounded
could
i
have
directed
events
i
should
have
chosen
for
the
good
of
the
country
to
have
been
disabled
in
your
stead
it
was
not
the
verdict
of
the
southern
people
no
man
it
was
said
by
one
who
knew
them
well
had
so
magnificent
prospect
before
him
as
general
jackson
whether
he
desired
it
or
not
he
could
not
have
escaped
being
governor
of
virginia

also
in
the
opinion
of
competent
judges

or
later

was
it
the

general

chancellorsville

even
his

but
providentially
for
us
it
was
the
last

he
waged
against

american

bold

in
energy
of

which
he
had
the
power
to
diffuse
in
indefatigable
activity
and

ascendency

stood

and

above
his
confrères
and
after
his
death
general
lee
could
not
replace

battles
and
leaders
volume
page
it
can
hardly
be
questioned
that
at
the
time
of
his
death
jackson
was
the
leader
most
trusted
by
the
confederates
and
most
dreaded
by
the
federals
his
own
soldiers
and
with
them
the
whole
population
of
the
south
believed
him
capable
of
any
task
invincible
except
by
fate
it
never
indeed
fell
to
jackson
lot
to
lead
a
great
army
or
to
plan
a
great
campaign
the
operations
in
the
valley
although
decisive
in
their
results
were
comparatively
insignificant
in
respect
both
of
the
numbers
employed
and
of
the
extent
of
the
theatre
jackson
was
not
wholly
independent
his
was
but
a
secondary
role
and
he
had
to
weigh
at
every
turn
the
orders
and
instructions
of
his
superiors
his
hand
was
never
absolutely
free
his
authority
did
not
reach
beyond
certain
limits
and
his
operations
were
confined
to
one
locality
he
was
never
permitted
to
cross
the
border
and
carry
the
war
into
africa
nor
when
he
joined
lee
before
richmond
was
the
restraint
removed
in
the
campaign
against
pope
and
in
the
reduction
of
harper
ferry
he
was
certainly
entrusted
with
tasks
which
led
to
a
complete
severance
from
the
main
body
but
the
severance
was
merely
temporary
he
was
the
most
trusted
of
lieutenants
but
he
was
only
a
lieutenant
he
had
never
the
same
liberty
of
action
as
those
of
his
contemporaries
who
rose
to
historic
fame
as
lee
himself
as
johnston
or
beauregard
as
grant
or
sherman
or
as
sheridan
and
consequently
he
had
never
a
real
opportunity
for
revealing
the
height
and
breadth
of
his
military
genius
the
civil
war
was
prolific
of
great
leaders
the
young
american
generals
inexperienced
as
they
were
in
dealing
with
large
armies
and
compelled
to
improvise
their
tactics
as
they
improvised
their
staff
displayed
a
talent
for
command
such
as
soldiers
more
regularly
trained
could
hardly
have
surpassed
neither
the
deficiencies
of
their
material
nor
the
difficulties
of
the
theatre
of
war
were
to
be
lightly
overcome
and
yet
their
methods
displayed
a
refreshing
originality
not
only
in
mechanical
auxiliaries
did
the
inventive
genius
of
their
race
find
scope
the
principles
which
govern
civilised
warfare
the
rules
which
control
the
employment
of
each
arm
the
technical
and
mechanical
arts
were
rapidly
modified
to
the
exigencies
of
the
troops
and
of
the
country
cavalry
intrenchments
the
railway
the
telegraph
balloons
signalling
were
all
used
in
a
manner
which
had
been
hitherto
unknown
monitors
and
torpedoes
were
for
the
first
time
seen
and
even
the
formations
of
infantry
were
made
sufficiently
elastic
to
meet
the
requirements
of
a
modern
nor
was
the
conduct
of
the
operations
fettered
by
an
adherence
to
conventional
practice
from
first
to
last
the
campaigns
were
characterised
by
daring
and
often
skilful
manoeuvres
and
if
the
tactics
of
the
were
often
less
brilliant
than
the
preceding
movements
not
only
are
parallels
to
these
tactics
to
be
found
in
almost
every
campaign
of
history
but
they
would
probably
have
escaped
criticism
had
the
opponent
been
less
skilful
but
among
the
galaxy
of
leaders
confederate
and
federal
in
none
had
the
soldiers
such
implicit
confidence
as
in
stonewall
jackson
and
than
the
southern
soldiers
highly
educated
as
many
of
them
were
no
better
judges
of
military
capacity
were
ever
known
nevertheless
the
opinion
of
the
soldiers
is
no
convincing
proof
that
jackson
was
equal
to
the
command
of
a
large
army
or
that
he
could
have
carried
through
a
great
campaign
had
lee
been
disabled
it
might
be
asked
would
jackson
have
proved
a
sufficient
substitute
it
has
already
been
explained
that
military
genius
shows
itself
first
in
character
and
second
in
the
application
of
the
grand
principles
of
warfare
not
in
the
mere
manipulation
of
armed
masses
it
can
not
well
be
denied
that
jackson
possessed
every
single
attribute
which
makes
for
success
in
war
morally
and
physically
he
was
absolutely
fearless
he
accepted
responsibility
with
the
same
equanimity
that
he
faced
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
he
permitted
no
obstacle
to
turn
him
aside
from
his
appointed
path
and
in
seizing
an
opportunity
or
in
following
up
a
victory
he
was
the
very
incarnation
of
untiring
energy
he
had
no
moments
of
weakness
he
was
not
robust
and
his
extraordinary
exertions
told
upon
his
constitution
my
health
he
wrote
to
his
wife
in
january
is
essentially
good
but
i
do
not
think
i
shall
be
able
in
future
to
stand
what
i
have
already
stood
and
yet
his
will
invariably
rose
superior
to
bodily
exhaustion
a
supreme
activity
both
of
brain
and
body
was
a
prominent
characteristic
of
his
military
life
his
idea
of
strategy
was
to
secure
the
initiative
however
inferior
his
force
to
create
opportunities
and
to
utilise
them
to
waste
no
time
and
to
give
the
enemy
no
rest
war
he
said
means
fighting
the
business
of
the
soldier
is
to
fight
armies
are
not
called
out
to
dig
trenches
to
throw
up
breastworks
to
live
in
camps
but
to
find
the
enemy
and
strike
him
to
invade
his
country
and
do
him
all
possible
damage
in
the
shortest
possible
time
this
will
involve
great
destruction
of
life
and
property
while
it
lasts
but
such
a
war
will
of
necessity
be
of
brief
continuance
and
so
would
be
an
economy
of
life
and
property
in
the
end
to
move
swiftly
strike
vigorously
and
secure
all
the
fruits
of
victory
is
the
secret
of
successful
war
that
he
felt
to
the
full
the
fascination
of
war
tremendous
game
we
can
hardly
doubt
not
only
did
he
derive
as
all
true
soldiers
must
an
intense
intellectual
pleasure
from
handling
his
troops
in
battle
so
as
to
outwit
and
defeat
his
adversary
but
from
the
day
he
first
smelt
powder
in
mexico
until
he
led
that
astonishing
charge
through
the
dark
depths
of
the
wilderness
his
spirits
never
rose
higher
than
when
danger
and
death
were
rife
about
him
with
all
his
gentleness
there
was
much
of
the
old
berserker
about
stonewall
jackson
not
indeed
the
lust
for
blood
but
the
longing
to
do
doughtily
and
die
bravely
as
best
becomes
a
man
his
nature
was
essentially
aggressive
he
was
never
more
to
be
feared
than
when
he
was
retreating
and
where
others
thought
only
of
strong
defensive
positions
he
looked
persistently
for
the
opportunity
to
attack
he
was
endowed
like
masséna
with
that
rare
fortitude
which
seems
to
increase
as
perils
thicken
when
conquered
he
was
as
ready
to
fight
again
as
if
he
had
been
conqueror
et
toujours
was
the
mainspring
of
all
his
actions
and
the
very
sights
and
sounds
of
a
stricken
field
were
dear
to
his
soul
nothing
had
such
power
to
stir
his
pulses
as
the
rebel
yell
i
remember
says
a
one
night
at
tattoo
that
this
cry
broke
forth
in
the
camp
of
the
stonewall
brigade
and
was
taken
up
by
brigades
and
divisions
until
it
rang
out
far
over
field
and
woods
the
general
came
hastily
and
bareheaded
from
his
tent
and
leaning
on
a
fence
near
by
listened
in
silence
to
the
rise
the
climax
and
the
fall
of
that
strange
serenade
raising
his
head
to
catch
the
sound
as
it
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
died
away
at
last
like
an
echo
among
the
mountains
then
turning
towards
his
tent
he
muttered
in
half
soliloquy
that
was
the
sweetest
music
i
ever
heard
yet
least
of
all
was
jackson
a
mere
fighting
soldier
trusting
to
his
lucky
star
and
resolute
blows
to
pull
him
through
he
was
not
indeed
one
of
those
generals
who
seek
to
win
victories
without
shedding
blood
he
never
spared
his
men
either
in
marching
or
fighting
when
a
great
result
was
to
be
achieved
and
he
was
content
with
nothing
less
than
the
complete
annihilation
of
the
enemy
had
we
taken
ten
sail
said
nelson
and
allowed
the
eleventh
to
escape
when
it
had
been
possible
to
have
got
at
her
i
could
never
have
called
it
well
done
jackson
was
of
the
same
mind
with
blessing
he
said
before
the
valley
campaign
let
us
make
thorough
work
of
it
when
once
he
had
joined
battle
no
loss
no
suffering
was
permitted
to
stay
his
hand
he
never
dreamed
of
retreat
until
he
had
put
in
his
last
reserve
yet
his
victories
were
won
rather
by
sweat
than
blood
by
skilful
manoeuvring
rather
than
sheer
hard
fighting
solicitous
as
he
was
of
the
comfort
of
his
men
he
had
no
hesitation
when
his
opportunity
was
ripe
of
taxing
their
powers
of
endurance
to
the
uttermost
but
the
marches
which
strewed
the
wayside
with
the
footsore
and
the
weaklings
won
his
battles
the
enemy
surprised
and
outnumbered
was
practically
beaten
before
a
shot
was
fired
and
success
was
attained
at
a
trifling
cost
yet
despite
his
energy
jackson
was
eminently
patient
he
knew
when
to
refuse
battle
just
as
well
as
he
knew
when
to
deliver
it
he
was
never
induced
to
fight
except
on
his
own
terms
that
is
on
his
own
ground
and
at
his
own
time
save
at
kernstown
only
and
there
the
strategical
situation
forced
his
hand
and
he
was
eminently
cautious
before
he
committed
himself
to
movement
he
deliberated
long
and
he
never
attacked
until
he
had
ample
information
he
ran
risks
and
great
ones
but
in
war
the
nettle
danger
must
be
boldly
grasped
and
in
jackson
case
the
dangers
were
generally
more
apparent
than
real
under
his
orders
the
cavalry
became
an
admirable
instrument
of
reconnaissance
he
showed
a
marked
sagacity
for
selecting
scouts
both
officers
and
privates
and
his
system
for
obtaining
intelligence
was
perfect
he
had
the
rare
faculty
which
would
appear
instinctive
but
which
is
the
fruit
of
concentrated
thought
allied
to
a
wide
knowledge
of
war
of
divining
the
intention
of
his
adversary
and
the
state
of
his
moral
his
power
of
drawing
inferences
often
from
seemingly
unimportant
trifles
was
akin
to
that
of
the
hunter
of
his
native
backwoods
to
whom
the
rustle
of
a
twig
the
note
of
a
bird
a
track
upon
the
sand
speak
more
clearly
than
written
characters
his
estimate
of
the
demoralisation
of
the
federal
army
after
bull
run
and
of
the
ease
with
which
washington
might
have
been
captured
was
absolutely
correct
in
the
middle
of
may
both
lee
and
johnston
notwithstanding
jackson
victory
over
milroy
anticipated
that
banks
would
leave
the
valley
jackson
thought
otherwise
and
jackson
was
right
after
the
bloody
repulse
at
malvern
hill
when
his
generals
reported
the
terrible
confusion
in
the
confederate
ranks
he
simply
stated
his
opinion
that
the
enemy
was
retreating
and
went
to
sleep
again
a
week
later
he
suggested
that
the
whole
army
should
move
against
pope
for
mcclellan
he
said
would
never
dare
to
march
on
richmond
at
sharpsburg
as
the
shells
cut
the
trees
to
pieces
in
the
west
wood
and
the
heavy
masses
of
federal
infantry
filled
the
fields
in
front
he
told
his
medical
director
that
mcclellan
had
done
his
worst
at
fredericksburg
after
the
first
day
battle
he
believed
that
the
enemy
was
already
defeated
and
anticipating
their
escape
under
cover
of
the
darkness
he
advised
a
night
attack
with
the
bayonet
his
knowledge
of
his
adversary
character
derived
in
great
degree
from
his
close
observation
of
every
movement
enabled
him
to
predict
with
astonishing
accuracy
exactly
how
he
would
act
under
given
circumstances
nor
can
he
be
charged
in
any
single
instance
with
neglect
of
precautions
by
which
the
risks
of
war
are
diminished
he
appears
to
have
thought
out
and
to
have
foreseen
and
here
his
imaginative
power
aided
him
every
combination
that
could
be
made
against
him
and
to
have
provided
for
every
possible
emergency
he
was
never
surprised
never
disconcerted
never
betrayed
into
a
false
manoeuvre
although
on
some
occasions
his
success
fell
short
of
his
expectations
the
fault
was
not
his
his
strategy
was
always
admirable
but
fortune
in
one
guise
or
another
the
indiscipline
of
the
cavalry
the
inefficiency
of
subordinates
the
difficulties
of
the
country
interfered
with
the
full
accomplishment
of
his
designs
but
whatever
could
be
done
to
render
fortune
powerless
that
jackson
did
by
means
of
his
cavalry
by
forced
marches
by
the
careful
selection
of
his
line
of
march
of
his
camps
of
his
positions
of
his
magazines
and
lastly
by
his
consistent
reticence
he
effectually
concealed
from
the
federals
both
his
troops
and
his
designs
never
surprised
himself
he
seldom
failed
to
surprise
his
enemies
if
not
tactically
that
is
while
they
were
resting
in
their
camps
at
least
strategically
kernstown
came
as
a
surprise
to
banks
mcdowell
to
frémont
banks
believed
jackson
to
be
at
harrisonburg
when
he
had
already
defeated
the
detachment
at
front
royal
at
cross
keys
and
port
republic
neither
frémont
nor
shields
expected
that
their
flying
foe
would
suddenly
turn
at
bay
pope
was
unable
to
support
banks
at
cedar
run
till
the
battle
had
been
decided
when
mcclellan
on
the
chickahominy
was
informed
that
the
valley
army
had
joined
lee
it
was
too
late
to
alter
his
dispositions
and
no
surprise
was
ever
more
complete
than
chancellorsville
and
the
mystery
that
always
involved
jackson
movements
was
undoubtedly
the
result
of
calculation
he
knew
the
effect
his
sudden
appearances
and
disappearances
would
have
on
the
morale
of
the
federal
generals
and
he
relied
as
much
on
upsetting
the
mental
equilibrium
of
his
opponents
as
on
concentrating
against
them
superior
numbers
nor
was
his
view
confined
to
the
field
of
battle
and
his
immediate
adversary
it
embraced
the
whole
theatre
of
war
the
motive
power
which
ruled
the
enemy
politics
as
well
as
his
armies
was
always
his
real
objective
from
the
very
first
he
recognised
the
weakness
of
the
federal
position
the
anxiety
with
which
the
president
and
the
people
regarded
washington
and
on
this
anxiety
he
traded
every
blow
struck
in
the
valley
campaign
from
kernstown
to
cross
keys
was
struck
at
lincoln
and
his
cabinet
every
movement
including
the
advance
against
pope
on
cedar
run
was
calculated
with
reference
to
the
effect
it
would
produce
in
the
federal
councils
and
if
he
consistently
advocated
invasion
it
was
not
because
virginia
would
be
relieved
of
the
enemy
presence
but
because
treaties
of
peace
are
only
signed
within
sight
of
the
hostile
capital
it
has
been
urged
that
the
generals
whom
jackson
defeated
were
men
of
inferior
stamp
and
that
his
capacity
for
command
was
consequently
never
fairly
tested
had
grant
or
sheridan
it
is
said
been
pitted
against
him
in
the
valley
or
sherman
or
thomas
on
the
rappahannock
his
laurels
would
never
have
been
won
the
contention
is
fair
generals
of
such
calibre
as
banks
and
frémont
shields
and
pope
committed
blunders
which
the
more
skilful
leaders
would
undoubtedly
have
avoided
and
again
had
he
been
pitted
against
a
worthy
antagonist
jackson
would
probably
have
acted
with
less
audacity
and
greater
caution
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
however
that
the
fact
would
either
have
disturbed
his
brain
or
weakened
his
resolution
few
generals
apparently
have
been
caught
in
worse
predicaments
than
he
was
first
when
his
army
was
near
harper
ferry
and
frémont
and
shields
were
converging
on
his
rear
second
when
he
lay
in
the
woods
near
groveton
with
no
news
from
longstreet
and
pope
army
all
around
him
third
when
he
was
marching
by
the
brock
road
to
strike
hooker
right
and
sickles
column
struck
in
between
himself
and
lee
but
it
was
at
such
junctures
as
these
that
his
was
most
complete
and
his
skill
most
marked
the
greater
the
peril
the
more
fixed
became
his
purpose
the
capacity
of
the
opponent
moreover
can
not
be
accepted
as
the
true
touchstone
of
generalship
the
greatest
general
said
napoleon
is
he
who
makes
the
fewest
mistakes
he
who
neither
neglects
an
opportunity
nor
offers
one
thus
tested
jackson
has
few
superiors
during
the
whole
of
the
two
years
he
held
command
he
never
committed
a
single
error
at
mechanicsville
and
again
at
frayser
farm
the
failure
to
establish
some
method
of
intercommunication
left
his
column
isolated
this
however
was
a
failure
in
staff
duties
for
which
the
confederate
headquarters
was
more
to
blame
than
himself
and
further
how
sure
and
swift
was
the
retribution
which
followed
a
mistake
committed
within
his
sphere
of
action
what
opportunity
did
jackson
miss
his
penetration
was
unerring
and
when
after
he
had
marked
his
prey
did
he
ever
hesitate
to
swoop
what
seemed
reckless
audacity
it
has
been
well
said
by
one
of
the
greatest
of
southern
soldiers
was
the
essence
of
prudence
his
eye
had
caught
at
a
glance
the
entire
situation
and
his
genius
with
marvellous
celerity
and
accuracy
had
weighed
all
the
chances
of
success
or
failure
while
therefore
others
were
slowly
feeling
their
way
or
employing
in
detail
insufficient
forces
jackson
without
for
one
moment
doubting
his
success
hurled
his
army
like
a
thunderbolt
against
the
opposing
lines
and
thus
ended
the
battle
at
a
single
blow
general
gordon
commanding
army
corps
army
of
northern
virginia
jackson
says
one
of
his
staff
never
changed
an
order
on
the
battlefield
when
he
had
once
given
it
i
have
seen
ewell
early
hill
and
even
lee
send
an
aide
with
an
order
and
in
a
few
minutes
send
another
messenger
to
recall
or
alter
it
letter
to
the
author
but
if
jackson
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
his
blunders
it
might
be
said
that
he
sometimes
laid
himself
open
to
defeat
grant
and
sheridan
had
they
been
in
place
of
shields
and
frémont
would
hardly
have
suffered
him
to
escape
from
ferry
sherman
would
probably
have
crushed
him
at
the
second
manassas
thomas
would
not
have
been
surprised
at
chancellorsville
but
jackson
only
pushed
daring
to
its
limits
when
it
was
safe
to
do
so
he
knew
the
men
he
had
to
deal
with
and
in
whatever
situation
he
might
find
himself
he
invariably
reserved
more
than
one
means
of
escape
on
the
field
of
battle
his
manoeuvres
were
always
sound
and
often
brilliant
he
never
failed
to
detect
the
of
a
position
or
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
ground
on
the
defensive
his
flanks
were
always
strong
and
his
troops
concealed
both
from
view
and
fire
on
the
offensive
he
invariably
attacked
where
he
was
least
expected
he
handled
the
three
arms
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
in
the
closest
combination
and
with
the
maximum
of
effect
except
at
kernstown
where
garnett
interfered
his
reserve
was
invariably
put
in
at
exactly
the
right
moment
and
he
so
manipulated
his
command
that
he
was
always
strongest
at
the
decisive
point
nor
did
he
forget
that
a
battle
is
only
half
won
where
there
is
no
pursuit
and
whenever
he
held
command
upon
the
field
his
troops
especially
the
cavalry
were
so
disposed
that
from
the
very
outset
the
retreat
was
menaced
the
soldiers
sharers
in
his
achievements
compared
his
tactical
leading
with
that
of
others
and
gave
the
palm
to
jackson
an
officer
of
his
staff
who
served
continuously
with
the
army
of
northern
virginia
says
i
was
engaged
in
no
great
battle
subsequent
to
jackson
death
in
which
i
did
not
see
the
opportunity
which
in
my
opinion
he
would
have
seized
and
have
routed
our
opponents
major
hotchkiss
and
general
lane
writes
that
on
many
a
field
subsequent
to
chancellorsville
he
heard
his
veterans
exclaim
oh
for
another
jackson
until
jackson
fell
the
army
of
northern
virginia
except
when
his
advice
was
overruled
had
never
missed
an
opening
afterwards
it
missed
many
gettysburg
which
should
have
been
decisive
of
the
war
was
a
battle
of
lost
opportunities
and
there
are
others
which
fall
into
the
same
category
it
is
a
perfectly
fair
assumption
then
that
jackson
so
unerring
was
his
insight
would
not
only
have
proved
an
efficient
substitute
for
lee
but
that
he
would
have
won
such
fame
as
would
have
placed
him
as
it
placed
his
great
commander
among
the
most
illustrious
soldiers
of
all
ages
with
any
of
his
contemporaries
not
even
excepting
lee
he
compares
more
than
favourably
most
obedient
of
subordinates
as
he
was
his
strategical
views
were
not
always
in
accordance
with
those
of
his
if
jackson
had
been
in
charge
of
the
operations
the
disastrous
battle
of
malvern
hill
would
never
have
been
fought
pope
would
have
been
cut
off
from
the
rappahannock
mcclellan
would
have
found
the
whole
confederate
army
arrayed
against
him
at
south
mountain
or
would
have
been
attacked
near
frederick
and
burnside
would
have
been
encountered
on
the
north
anna
where
defeat
would
probably
have
proved
his
ruin
it
is
difficult
to
compare
him
with
lee
a
true
estimate
of
lee
genius
is
impossible
for
it
can
never
be
known
to
what
extent
his
designs
were
thwarted
by
the
confederate
government
lee
served
davis
jackson
served
lee
wisest
and
most
helpful
of
masters
it
would
seem
however
that
jackson
in
one
respect
was
lee
superior
his
courage
physical
and
moral
was
not
more
brilliant
or
more
steadfast
his
tactical
skill
no
greater
but
he
was
made
of
sterner
stuff
his
was
supreme
he
never
doubted
his
ability
with
god
help
to
carry
out
any
task
his
judgment
approved
lee
on
the
other
hand
was
oppressed
by
a
consciousness
of
his
own
shortcomings
jackson
never
held
but
one
council
of
war
lee
seldom
made
an
important
movement
without
consulting
his
corps
commanders
jackson
kept
his
subordinates
in
their
place
exacting
from
his
generals
the
same
implicit
obedience
he
exacted
from
his
corporals
lee
lost
the
battle
of
gettysburg
because
he
allowed
his
second
in
command
to
argue
instead
of
marching
nor
was
that
political
courage
which
nelson
declared
is
as
necessary
for
a
commander
as
military
courage
a
component
part
of
lee
character
lord
wolseley
macmillan
magazine
march
on
assuming
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
in
spite
of
davis
protestations
he
resigned
the
control
of
the
whole
forces
of
the
confederacy
and
he
submitted
without
complaint
to
interference
jackson
action
when
loring
regiments
were
ordered
back
by
the
secretary
of
war
is
sufficient
proof
that
he
would
have
brooked
no
meddling
with
his
designs
when
once
they
had
received
the
sanction
of
the
cabinet
at
the
same
time
it
must
remain
undetermined
whether
jackson
was
equal
to
the
vast
responsibilities
which
lee
bore
with
such
steadfast
courage
whether
he
could
have
administered
a
great
army
under
the
most
untoward
circumstances
with
the
same
success
whether
he
could
have
assuaged
the
jealousies
of
the
different
states
and
have
dealt
so
tactfully
with
both
officers
and
men
that
there
should
have
been
no
friction
between
virginians
and
georgians
texans
and
carolinians
it
is
probable
that
jackson
temper
was
more
akin
to
grant
than
lee
grant
had
the
same
regard
for
the
cause
the
same
disregard
for
the
individual
he
was
just
as
ready
as
jackson
to
place
a
recalcitrant
subordinate
no
matter
how
high
his
rank
under
instant
arrest
and
towards
the
incompetent
and
unsuccessful
he
was
just
as
pitiless
jackson
however
had
the
finer
intellect
the
federal
was
unquestionably
a
great
soldier
greater
than
those
who
overlook
his
difficulties
in
the
campaign
are
disposed
to
admit
as
a
strategist
he
ranks
high
but
grant
was
no
master
of
stratagem
there
was
no
mystery
about
his
operations
his
manoeuvres
were
strong
and
straightforward
but
he
had
no
skill
in
deceiving
his
adversary
and
his
tactics
were
not
always
of
a
high
order
it
may
be
questioned
whether
on
the
field
of
battle
his
ability
was
equal
to
that
of
sherman
or
of
sherman
great
antagonist
johnston
elsewhere
he
was
their
superior
both
sherman
and
johnston
were
methodical
rather
than
brilliant
patient
confident
and
as
they
were
strictly
observant
of
the
established
principles
of
war
they
were
without
a
touch
of
that
aggressive
genius
which
distinguished
lee
grant
and
jackson
nevertheless
to
put
jackson
above
grant
is
to
place
him
high
on
the
list
of
illustrious
captains
yet
the
claim
is
not
extravagant
if
his
military
characteristics
are
compared
with
those
of
so
great
a
soldier
as
wellington
it
will
be
seen
that
in
many
respects
they
run
on
parallel
lines
both
had
perfect
confidence
in
their
own
capacity
i
can
do
said
jackson
whatever
i
will
to
do
while
the
duke
when
a
young
general
in
india
congratulated
himself
that
he
had
learned
not
to
be
deterred
by
apparent
impossibilities
both
were
patient
fighting
on
their
own
terms
or
fighting
not
at
all
both
were
prudent
and
yet
when
audacity
was
justified
by
the
character
of
their
opponent
and
the
condition
of
his
troops
they
took
no
counsel
of
their
fears
they
were
not
enamoured
of
the
defensive
for
they
knew
the
value
of
the
initiative
and
that
offensive
strategy
is
the
strategy
which
annihilates
yet
when
their
enemy
remained
concentrated
they
were
content
to
wait
till
they
could
induce
him
to
disperse
both
were
masters
of
ruse
and
stratagem
and
the
virginian
was
as
industrious
as
the
englishman
and
in
yet
another
respect
they
were
alike
in
issuing
orders
or
giving
verbal
instruction
jackson
words
were
few
and
simple
but
they
were
so
clear
so
comprehensive
and
direct
that
no
officer
could
possibly
misunderstand
and
none
dared
disobey
general
gordon
exactly
the
same
terms
might
be
applied
to
wellington
again
although
naturally
impetuous
glorying
in
war
they
had
no
belief
in
a
lucky
star
their
imagination
was
always
controlled
by
and
unlike
napoleon
their
ambition
to
succeed
was
always
subordinate
to
their
judgment
yet
both
when
circumstances
were
imperative
were
greatly
daring
the
attacks
at
groveton
and
at
chancellorsville
were
enterprises
instinct
with
the
same
intensity
of
resolution
as
the
storm
of
badajos
and
ciudad
rodrigo
the
passage
of
the
douro
the
great
counterstroke
of
salamanca
on
the
field
of
battle
the
one
was
not
more
vigilant
nor
imperturbable
than
the
other
and
both
possessed
a
due
sense
of
proportion
they
knew
exactly
how
much
they
could
effect
themselves
and
how
much
must
be
left
to
others
recognising
that
when
once
the
action
had
opened
the
sphere
in
which
their
authority
could
be
exercised
was
very
limited
they
gave
their
subordinates
a
free
hand
issuing
few
orders
and
encouraging
their
men
rather
by
example
than
by
words
both
too
had
that
most
rare
faculty
of
coming
to
prompt
and
sure
conclusions
in
sudden
exigencies
the
certain
mark
of
a
in
war
napier
at
bull
run
jackson
was
ordered
to
support
evans
at
the
stone
bridge
learning
that
the
left
was
compromised
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
turned
aside
and
placed
his
brigade
in
the
only
position
where
it
could
have
held
its
ground
at
groveton
when
he
received
the
news
that
the
federal
left
wing
was
retreating
on
centreville
across
his
front
the
order
for
attack
was
issued
almost
before
he
had
read
the
dispatch
at
chancellorsville
when
general
fitzhugh
lee
showed
him
the
enemy
right
wing
dispersed
and
unsuspecting
he
simply
turned
to
his
courier
and
said
let
the
column
cross
the
road
and
his
plan
of
battle
was
designed
with
the
same
rapidity
as
wellington
at
salamanca
or
assaye
it
has
been
already
pointed
out
that
jackson
dispositions
for
defence
differed
in
no
degree
from
those
of
the
great
duke
his
visit
to
waterloo
perhaps
taught
the
american
soldier
the
value
and
importance
of
concealing
his
troops
on
the
defensive
it
was
not
however
from
wellington
that
he
learned
to
keep
his
plans
to
himself
and
to
use
every
effort
to
mislead
his
adversary
yet
no
general
not
even
napoleon
himself
brought
about
so
many
startling
surprises
as
wellington
the
passage
of
the
douro
the
storm
of
the
frontier
fortresses
the
flank
attack
at
vittoria
the
passage
of
the
adour
the
passage
of
the
bidassoa
were
each
and
all
of
them
utterly
unexpected
by
the
french
marshals
and
those
were
by
no
means
the
only
or
the
most
conspicuous
instances
was
ever
general
more
surprised
than
masséna
when
pursuing
his
retreating
foe
through
portugal
in
full
anticipation
of
driving
the
leopards
into
the
sea
he
suddenly
saw
before
him
the
frowning
lines
of
torres
vedras
the
great
fortress
which
had
sprung
from
earth
as
it
were
at
the
touch
of
a
magician
wand
the
dispatches
and
correspondence
of
the
generals
who
were
opposed
to
wellington
are
the
clearest
evidence
of
his
extraordinary
skill
despite
their
long
experience
their
system
of
spies
their
excellent
cavalry
superior
during
the
first
years
of
the
peninsular
war
both
in
numbers
and
training
to
the
english
it
was
seldom
indeed
that
the
french
had
more
than
the
vaguest
knowledge
of
his
movements
his
intentions
or
his
strength
on
no
other
theatre
of
war
and
they
were
familiar
with
many
had
they
encountered
so
mysterious
an
enemy
and
what
was
the
result
constantly
surprised
themselves
they
at
length
hesitated
to
attack
even
isolated
detachments
at
guinaldo
in
marmont
with
soldiers
refused
to
assault
a
ridge
occupied
by
no
more
than
the
morning
of
when
that
important
position
was
but
thinly
held
even
ney
was
reluctant
to
engage
in
the
judgment
of
himself
and
his
subordinates
who
had
met
wellington
before
the
fact
that
there
were
but
few
red
jackets
to
be
seen
was
no
proof
whatever
that
the
whole
allied
army
was
not
close
at
hand
and
the
opportunity
was
suffered
to
escape
other
generals
have
been
content
with
surprising
the
enemy
when
they
advanced
against
him
wellington
and
jackson
sought
to
do
so
even
when
they
were
confined
to
the
defensive
and
in
still
another
respect
may
a
likeness
be
found
regard
for
truth
was
not
more
scrupulous
than
wellington
neither
declined
to
employ
every
legitimate
means
of
deceiving
their
enemies
but
both
were
absolutely
incapable
of
and
this
characteristic
was
not
without
effect
on
their
military
conduct
although
never
deterred
by
difficulties
they
distinguished
clearly
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
to
gain
great
ends
they
were
willing
to
run
risks
but
if
their
plans
are
carefully
considered
it
will
be
seen
that
the
margin
left
to
chance
was
small
the
odds
were
invariably
in
their
favour
in
conception
as
in
execution
obstacles
were
resolutely
faced
and
they
were
constitutionally
unable
to
close
their
eyes
to
contingencies
that
might
prove
ruinous
the
promise
of
great
results
was
never
suffered
to
cajole
them
into
ignoring
the
perils
that
might
beset
their
path
imagination
might
display
in
vivid
colours
the
success
that
might
accrue
from
some
audacious
venture
but
if
one
step
was
obscure
the
idea
was
unhesitatingly
rejected
undazzled
by
the
prospect
of
personal
glory
they
formed
a
true
not
an
untrue
picture
of
the
business
to
be
done
and
their
plans
consequently
were
without
a
flaw
brilliant
indeed
were
the
campaigns
of
napoleon
and
astonishing
his
successes
but
he
who
had
so
often
deceived
others
in
the
end
deceived
himself
accustomed
to
the
dark
dealings
of
intrigue
and
chicanery
his
judgment
once
so
penetrating
became
blunted
he
believed
what
he
wished
to
believe
and
not
that
which
was
fact
more
than
once
in
his
later
campaigns
he
persuaded
himself
that
the
chances
were
with
him
when
in
reality
they
were
terribly
against
him
he
trusted
to
the
star
that
had
befriended
him
at
marengo
and
at
aspern
that
is
he
would
not
admit
the
truth
even
to
himself
that
he
had
been
overdaring
that
it
was
fortune
and
fortune
alone
that
had
saved
him
from
destruction
and
moscow
and
vittoria
leipsic
and
waterloo
were
the
result
but
although
there
was
a
signal
resemblance
both
in
their
military
characters
as
in
their
methods
of
war
between
wellington
and
jackson
the
parallel
can
not
be
pushed
beyond
certain
limits
it
is
impossible
to
compare
their
intellectual
capacity
wellington
was
called
to
an
ampler
field
and
far
heavier
responsibilities
not
as
a
soldier
alone
but
as
financier
diplomatist
statesman
he
had
his
part
to
play
while
napoleon
languished
on
his
lonely
island
his
great
conqueror
the
plenipotentiary
of
his
own
government
the
most
trusted
counsellor
of
many
sovereigns
the
adviser
of
foreign
administrations
was
universally
acknowledged
as
the
mastermind
of
europe
nor
was
the
mark
which
wellington
left
on
history
insignificant
the
results
of
his
victories
were
lasting
the
freedom
of
the
nations
was
restored
to
them
and
land
and
sea
became
the
thoroughfares
of
peace
america
on
the
other
hand
owes
no
single
material
benefit
to
stonewall
jackson
in
the
cause
of
progress
or
of
peace
he
accomplished
nothing
the
principle
he
fought
for
the
right
of
secession
lives
no
longer
even
in
the
south
he
won
battles
he
enhanced
the
reputation
of
american
soldiers
he
proved
in
his
own
person
that
the
manhood
of
virginia
had
suffered
no
decay
and
this
was
all
but
the
fruits
of
a
man
work
are
not
to
be
measured
by
a
mere
utilitarian
standard
in
the
minds
of
his
own
countrymen
the
memory
of
wellington
is
hallowed
not
so
much
by
his
victories
as
by
his
unfaltering
honesty
and
his
steadfast
regard
for
duty
and
the
life
of
stonewall
jackson
is
fraught
with
lessons
of
still
deeper
import
not
only
with
the
army
but
with
the
people
of
the
south
his
influence
while
he
lived
was
very
great
from
him
thousands
and
ten
thousands
of
confederate
soldiers
learned
the
which
is
the
root
of
all
religion
the
which
is
the
root
of
all
manliness
see
note
at
end
of
volume
beyond
the
confines
of
the
camps
he
was
personally
unknown
in
the
social
and
political
circles
of
richmond
his
figure
was
unfamiliar
when
his
body
lay
in
state
the
majority
of
those
who
passed
through
the
hall
of
representatives
looked
upon
his
features
for
the
first
time
he
had
never
been
called
to
council
by
the
president
and
the
members
of
the
legislature
with
but
few
exceptions
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
man
who
acted
while
they
deliberated
but
his
fame
had
spread
far
and
wide
and
not
merely
the
fame
of
his
victories
but
of
his
christian
character
the
rare
union
of
strength
and
simplicity
of
faith
and
the
most
fiery
energy
had
attracted
the
sympathy
of
the
whole
country
of
the
north
as
well
as
of
the
south
and
beyond
the
atlantic
where
with
breathless
interest
the
parent
islands
were
watching
the
issue
of
the
mighty
conflict
it
seemed
that
another
cromwell
without
cromwell
ambition
or
that
another
wolfe
with
more
than
ability
had
arisen
among
the
soldiers
of
the
youngest
of
nations
and
this
interest
was
intensified
by
his
untimely
end
when
it
was
reported
that
jackson
had
fallen
men
murmured
in
their
dismay
against
the
fiat
of
the
almighty
why
they
asked
had
one
so
pure
and
so
upright
been
suddenly
cut
down
yet
a
sufficient
answer
was
not
far
to
seek
to
the
english
race
in
whatever
quarter
of
the
globe
it
holds
dominion
to
the
race
of
alfred
and
de
montfort
of
bruce
and
hampden
of
washington
and
gordon
the
ideal
of
manhood
has
ever
been
a
high
one
and
the
single
heart
are
the
attributes
which
it
most
delights
to
honour
and
chief
amongst
its
accepted
heroes
are
those
who
sealing
their
devotion
with
their
lives
have
won
death
royal
purple
in
the
foeman
lines
so
from
his
narrow
grave
on
the
green
hillside
at
lexington
jackson
speaks
with
voice
more
powerful
than
if
passing
peacefully
away
in
the
fulness
of
years
and
honours
he
had
found
a
in
some
proud
sepulchre
erected
by
a
victorious
and
grateful
commonwealth
and
who
is
there
who
can
refuse
to
listen
his
creed
may
not
be
ours
but
in
whom
shall
we
find
a
firmer
faith
a
mind
more
humble
a
sincerity
more
absolute
he
had
his
temptations
like
the
rest
of
us
his
passions
were
strong
his
temper
was
hot
forgiveness
never
came
easily
to
him
and
he
loved
power
he
dreaded
strong
liquor
because
he
liked
it
and
if
in
his
nature
there
were
great
capacities
for
good
there
were
none
the
less
had
it
been
once
perverted
great
capacities
for
evil
fearless
and
strong
and
ambitious
he
had
within
him
the
making
of
a
napoleon
and
yet
his
name
is
without
spot
or
blemish
from
his
boyhood
onward
until
he
died
on
the
rappahannock
he
was
the
very
model
of
a
christian
gentleman
as
he
trod
that
day
to
god
so
walked
he
from
his
birth
in
simpleness
and
gentleness
and
honour
and
clean
mirth
paradox
as
it
may
sound
the
great
rebel
was
the
most
loyal
of
men
his
devotion
to
virginia
was
hardly
surpassed
by
his
devotion
to
his
wife
and
he
made
no
secret
of
his
absolute
dependence
on
a
higher
power
every
action
was
a
prayer
for
every
action
was
begun
and
ended
in
the
name
of
the
almighty
consciously
and
unconsciously
in
deed
as
in
word
in
the
quiet
of
his
home
and
in
the
tumult
of
battle
he
fastened
to
his
soul
those
golden
chains
that
bind
the
whole
round
earth
about
the
feet
of
god
nor
was
their
burden
heavy
he
was
the
happiest
man
says
one
of
his
friends
i
ever
knew
and
he
was
wont
to
express
his
surprise
that
others
were
less
happy
than
himself
but
there
are
few
with
jackson
power
of
concentration
he
fought
evil
with
the
same
untiring
energy
that
he
fought
the
north
his
relations
to
his
moral
duties
were
governed
by
the
same
strong
purpose
the
same
clear
perception
of
the
aim
to
be
achieved
and
of
the
means
whereby
it
was
to
be
achieved
as
his
manoeuvres
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
always
thorough
and
it
was
because
he
was
thorough
true
steadfast
and
consistent
that
he
reached
the
heroic
standard
his
attainments
were
not
varied
his
interests
so
far
as
his
life
work
was
concerned
were
few
and
narrow
beyond
his
religion
and
the
army
he
seldom
permitted
his
thoughts
to
stray
his
acquaintance
with
art
was
small
he
meddled
little
with
politics
his
scholarship
was
not
profound
and
he
was
neither
sportsman
nor
naturalist
compared
with
many
of
the
prominent
figures
of
history
the
range
of
his
capacity
was
limited
and
yet
jackson
success
in
his
own
sphere
was
phenomenal
while
others
perhaps
of
more
pronounced
ability
seeking
success
in
many
different
directions
have
failed
to
find
it
in
a
single
one
even
when
we
contrast
his
recorded
words
with
the
sayings
of
those
whom
the
world
calls
great
statesmen
orators
authors
his
inferiority
is
hardly
apparent
he
saw
into
the
heart
of
things
both
human
and
divine
far
deeper
than
most
men
he
had
an
extraordinary
facility
for
grasping
the
essential
and
discarding
the
extraneous
his
language
was
simple
and
direct
without
elegance
or
embellishment
and
yet
no
one
has
excelled
him
in
crystallising
great
principles
in
a
single
phrase
the
few
maxims
which
fell
from
his
lips
are
almost
a
complete
summary
of
the
art
of
war
neither
frederick
nor
wellington
nor
napoleon
realised
more
deeply
the
simple
truths
which
ever
since
men
first
took
up
arms
have
been
the
elements
of
success
and
not
hampden
himself
beheld
with
clearer
insight
the
duties
and
obligations
which
devolve
on
those
who
love
their
country
well
but
freedom
more
it
is
possible
that
the
conflicts
of
the
south
are
not
yet
ended
in
america
men
pray
for
peace
but
dark
and
mysterious
forces
threatening
the
very
foundations
of
civic
liberty
are
stirring
even
now
beneath
their
feet
the
war
of
secession
may
be
the
precursor
of
a
fiercer
and
a
mightier
struggle
and
the
volunteers
of
the
confederacy
enduring
all
things
and
sacrificing
all
things
the
prototype
and
model
of
a
new
army
in
which
north
and
south
shall
march
to
battle
side
by
side
absit
omen
but
in
whatever
fashion
his
own
countrymen
may
deal
with
the
problems
of
the
future
the
story
of
stonewall
jackson
will
tell
them
in
what
spirit
they
should
be
faced
nor
has
that
story
a
message
for
america
alone
the
hero
who
lies
buried
at
lexington
in
the
valley
of
virginia
belongs
to
a
race
that
is
not
confined
to
a
single
continent
and
to
those
who
speak
the
same
tongue
and
in
whose
veins
the
same
blood
flows
his
words
come
home
like
an
echo
of
all
that
is
noblest
in
their
history
what
is
life
without
honour
degradation
is
worse
than
death
we
must
think
of
the
living
and
of
those
who
are
to
come
after
us
and
see
that
by
god
blessing
we
transmit
to
them
the
freedom
we
have
ourselves
inherited
note
john
president
of
the
mercantile
bank
of
new
york
relates
the
following
incident
a
year
or
two
ago
he
was
in
the
shenandoah
valley
with
general
thomas
jordan
and
at
the
close
of
the
day
they
found
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
in
a
wild
and
lonely
place
there
was
no
village
and
no
house
save
a
rough
shanty
for
the
use
of
the
on
the
railroad
it
was
not
an
attractive
place
for
rest
yet
here
they
were
forced
to
pass
the
night
and
to
sit
down
to
such
supper
as
might
be
provided
in
so
desolate
a
spot
the
unprepossessing
look
of
everything
was
completed
when
the
host
came
in
and
took
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
a
bear
out
of
the
woods
could
hardly
have
been
rougher
with
his
unshaven
hair
and
unkempt
beard
he
answered
to
the
type
of
border
ruffian
and
his
appearance
suggested
the
dark
deeds
that
might
be
done
here
in
secret
and
hidden
in
the
forest
gloom
imagine
the
astonishment
of
the
travellers
when
this
rough
backwoodsman
rapped
on
the
table
and
bowed
his
head
and
such
a
prayer
never
says
john
did
i
hear
a
petition
that
more
evidently
came
from
the
heart
it
was
so
simple
so
reverent
so
tender
so
full
of
humility
and
penitence
as
well
as
of
thankfulness
we
sat
in
silence
and
as
soon
as
we
recovered
ourselves
i
whispered
to
general
jordan
can
he
be
to
which
he
answered
do
know
but
he
must
be
one
of
stonewall
jackson
old
soldiers
and
he
was
as
we
walked
out
in
the
open
air
i
accosted
our
new
acquaintance
and
after
a
few
questions
about
the
country
asked
you
in
the
war
yes
