transcriber
note
for
edition
in
para
of
chapter
the
word
leafy
has
been
changed
to
leaky
leafy
was
the
word
used
in
the
printed
edition
but
was
an
obvious
misprint
some
readers
have
noted
that
other
editions
have
slightly
different
punctuation
notably
some
extra
commas
and
where
there
are
colons
in
this
edition
but
the
punctuation
herein
does
follow
at
least
one
printed
jt
a
damsel
in
distress
by
pelham
grenville
wodehouse
chapter
inasmuch
as
the
scene
of
this
story
is
that
historic
pile
belpher
castle
in
the
county
of
hampshire
it
would
be
an
agreeable
task
to
open
it
with
a
leisurely
description
of
the
place
followed
by
some
notes
on
the
history
of
the
earls
of
marshmoreton
who
have
owned
it
since
the
fifteenth
century
unfortunately
in
these
days
of
rush
and
hurry
a
novelist
works
at
a
disadvantage
he
must
leap
into
the
middle
of
his
tale
with
as
little
delay
as
he
would
employ
in
boarding
a
moving
tramcar
he
must
get
off
the
mark
with
the
smooth
swiftness
of
a
surprised
while
lunching
otherwise
people
throw
him
aside
and
go
out
to
picture
palaces
i
may
briefly
remark
that
the
present
lord
marshmoreton
is
a
widower
of
some
years
that
he
has
two
children
a
son
percy
wilbraham
marsh
lord
belpher
who
is
on
the
brink
of
his
birthday
and
a
daughter
lady
patricia
maud
marsh
who
is
just
twenty
that
the
chatelaine
of
the
castle
is
lady
caroline
byng
lord
marshmoreton
sister
who
married
the
very
wealthy
colliery
owner
clifford
byng
a
few
years
before
his
death
which
unkind
people
say
she
hastened
and
that
she
has
a
reginald
give
me
time
to
mention
these
few
facts
and
i
am
done
on
the
glorious
past
of
the
marshmoretons
i
will
not
even
touch
luckily
the
loss
to
literature
is
not
irreparable
lord
marshmoreton
himself
is
engaged
upon
a
history
of
the
family
which
will
doubtless
be
on
every
bookshelf
as
soon
as
his
lordship
gets
it
finished
and
as
for
the
castle
and
its
surroundings
including
the
model
dairy
and
the
amber
you
may
see
them
for
yourself
any
thursday
when
belpher
is
thrown
open
to
the
public
on
payment
of
a
fee
of
one
shilling
a
head
the
money
is
collected
by
keggs
the
butler
and
goes
to
a
worthy
local
charity
at
least
that
is
the
idea
but
the
voice
of
calumny
is
never
silent
and
there
exists
a
school
of
thought
headed
by
albert
the
which
holds
that
keggs
sticks
to
these
shillings
like
glue
and
adds
them
to
his
already
considerable
savings
in
the
farmers
and
merchants
bank
on
the
left
side
of
the
high
street
in
belpher
village
next
door
to
the
oddfellows
hall
with
regard
to
this
one
can
only
say
that
keggs
looks
far
too
much
like
a
particularly
saintly
bishop
to
indulge
in
any
such
practices
on
the
other
hand
albert
knows
keggs
we
must
leave
the
matter
open
of
course
appearances
are
deceptive
anyone
for
instance
who
had
been
standing
outside
the
front
entrance
of
the
castle
at
eleven
on
a
certain
june
morning
might
easily
have
made
a
mistake
such
a
person
would
probably
have
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lady
of
a
determined
cast
of
countenance
who
was
standing
near
the
talking
to
the
gardener
and
watching
the
young
couple
strolling
on
the
terrace
below
was
the
mother
of
the
pretty
girl
and
that
she
was
smiling
because
the
latter
had
recently
become
engaged
to
the
tall
youth
at
her
side
sherlock
holmes
himself
might
have
been
misled
one
can
hear
him
explaining
the
thing
to
watson
in
one
of
those
lightning
flashes
of
inductive
reasoning
of
his
it
is
the
only
explanation
my
dear
watson
if
the
lady
were
merely
complimenting
the
gardener
on
his
and
if
her
smile
were
merely
caused
by
the
excellent
appearance
of
that
there
would
be
an
answering
smile
on
the
face
of
the
gardener
but
as
you
see
he
looks
morose
and
gloomy
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
gardener
that
is
to
say
the
stocky
man
in
shirt
sleeves
and
corduroy
trousers
who
was
frowning
into
a
can
of
solution
was
the
earl
of
marshmoreton
and
there
were
two
reasons
for
his
gloom
he
hated
to
be
interrupted
while
working
and
furthermore
lady
caroline
byng
always
got
on
his
nerves
and
never
more
so
than
when
as
now
she
speculated
on
the
possibility
of
a
romance
between
her
reggie
and
his
lordship
daughter
maud
only
his
intimates
would
have
recognized
in
this
curious
figure
the
seventh
earl
of
marshmoreton
the
lord
marshmoreton
who
made
intermittent
appearances
in
london
who
lunched
among
bishops
at
the
athenaeum
club
without
exciting
remark
was
a
correctly
dressed
gentleman
whom
no
one
would
have
suspected
of
covering
his
sturdy
legs
in
anything
but
the
finest
cloth
but
if
you
will
glance
at
your
copy
of
who
who
and
turn
up
the
m
you
will
find
in
the
space
allotted
to
the
earl
the
words
hobby
gardening
to
which
in
a
burst
of
modest
pride
his
lordship
has
added
awarded
first
prize
for
hybrid
teas
temple
flower
show
the
words
tell
their
own
story
lord
marshmoreton
was
the
most
enthusiastic
amateur
gardener
in
a
land
of
enthusiastic
amateur
gardeners
he
lived
for
his
garden
the
love
which
other
men
expend
on
their
nearest
and
dearest
lord
marshmoreton
lavished
on
seeds
roses
and
loamy
soil
the
hatred
which
some
of
his
order
feel
for
socialists
and
demagogues
lord
marshmoreton
kept
for
rose
slugs
and
the
small
insect
which
is
so
depraved
and
sinister
a
character
that
it
goes
through
life
with
an
alias
being
sometimes
called
a
and
sometimes
a
thrip
a
simple
soul
lord
marshmoreton
mild
and
pleasant
yet
put
him
among
the
thrips
and
he
became
a
of
death
and
slaughter
a
destroyer
in
the
class
of
attila
the
hun
and
genghis
khan
thrips
feed
on
the
underside
of
rose
leaves
sucking
their
juice
and
causing
them
to
turn
yellow
and
lord
marshmoreton
views
on
these
things
were
so
rigid
that
he
would
have
poured
solution
on
his
grandmother
if
he
had
found
her
on
the
underside
of
one
of
his
rose
leaves
sucking
its
juice
the
only
time
in
the
day
when
he
ceased
to
be
the
toiler
and
became
the
aristocrat
was
in
the
evening
after
dinner
when
egged
on
by
lady
caroline
who
gave
him
no
rest
in
the
matter
he
would
retire
to
his
private
study
and
work
on
his
history
of
the
family
assisted
by
his
able
secretary
alice
faraday
his
progress
on
that
massive
work
was
however
slow
ten
hours
in
the
open
air
make
a
man
drowsy
and
too
often
lord
marshmoreton
would
fall
asleep
in
to
the
annoyance
of
miss
faraday
who
was
a
conscientious
girl
and
liked
to
earn
her
salary
the
couple
on
the
terrace
had
turned
reggie
byng
face
as
he
bent
over
maud
was
earnest
and
animated
and
even
from
a
distance
it
was
possible
to
see
how
the
girl
eyes
lit
up
at
what
he
was
saying
she
was
hanging
on
his
words
lady
caroline
smile
became
more
and
more
benevolent
they
make
a
charming
pair
she
murmured
i
wonder
what
dear
reggie
is
saying
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
she
broke
off
with
a
sigh
of
content
she
had
had
her
troubles
over
this
affair
dear
reggie
usually
so
plastic
in
her
hands
had
displayed
an
unaccountable
reluctance
to
offer
his
agreeable
self
to
maud
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
never
not
even
on
the
public
platform
which
she
adorned
so
well
had
his
reasoned
more
clearly
than
she
did
when
pointing
out
to
him
the
advantages
of
the
match
it
was
not
that
reggie
disliked
maud
he
admitted
that
she
was
a
topper
on
several
occasions
going
so
far
as
to
describe
her
as
absolutely
priceless
but
he
seemed
reluctant
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
how
could
lady
caroline
know
that
entire
world
or
such
of
it
as
was
not
occupied
by
racing
cars
and
golf
was
filled
by
alice
faraday
reggie
had
never
told
her
he
had
not
even
told
miss
faraday
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
went
on
lady
caroline
the
dear
boy
is
proposing
to
her
lord
marshmoreton
grunted
and
continued
to
peer
with
a
questioning
eye
in
the
awesome
brew
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
thrips
one
thing
is
very
satisfactory
said
lady
caroline
i
mean
that
maud
seems
entirely
to
have
got
over
that
ridiculous
infatuation
of
hers
for
that
man
she
met
in
wales
last
summer
she
could
not
be
so
cheerful
if
she
were
still
brooding
on
that
i
hope
you
will
admit
now
john
that
i
was
right
in
keeping
her
practically
a
prisoner
here
and
never
allowing
her
a
chance
of
meeting
the
man
again
either
by
accident
or
design
they
say
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
stuff
a
girl
of
maud
age
falls
in
and
out
of
love
half
a
dozen
times
a
year
i
feel
sure
she
has
almost
forgotten
the
man
by
now
eh
said
lord
marshmoreton
his
mind
had
been
far
away
dealing
with
green
flies
i
was
speaking
about
that
man
maud
met
when
she
was
staying
with
brenda
in
wales
oh
yes
oh
yes
echoed
lady
caroline
annoyed
is
that
the
only
comment
you
can
find
to
make
your
only
daughter
becomes
infatuated
with
a
perfect
stranger
a
man
we
have
never
seen
of
whom
we
know
nothing
not
even
his
name
nothing
except
that
he
is
an
american
and
a
penny
maud
admitted
that
and
all
you
say
is
yes
but
it
all
over
now
is
it
i
understood
the
dashed
affair
was
all
over
we
hope
so
but
i
should
feel
safer
if
maud
were
engaged
to
reggie
i
do
think
you
might
take
the
trouble
to
speak
to
maud
speak
to
her
i
do
speak
to
her
lord
marshmoreton
brain
moved
slowly
when
he
was
with
his
roses
we
on
excellent
terms
lady
caroline
frowned
impatiently
hers
was
an
alert
vigorous
mind
bright
and
strong
like
a
steel
trap
and
her
vagueness
and
growing
habit
of
inattention
irritated
her
i
mean
to
speak
to
her
about
becoming
engaged
to
reggie
you
are
her
father
surely
you
can
at
least
try
to
persuade
her
ca
coerce
a
girl
i
never
suggested
that
you
should
coerce
her
as
you
put
it
i
merely
meant
that
you
could
point
out
to
her
as
a
father
where
her
duty
and
happiness
lie
drink
this
cried
his
lordship
with
sudden
fury
spraying
his
can
over
the
nearest
bush
and
addressing
his
remark
to
the
invisible
thrips
he
had
forgotten
lady
caroline
completely
do
stint
yourselves
there
lots
more
a
girl
came
down
the
steps
of
the
castle
and
made
her
way
towards
them
she
was
a
girl
with
an
air
of
quiet
efficiency
about
her
her
eyes
were
grey
and
whimsical
her
head
was
uncovered
and
the
breeze
stirred
her
dark
hair
she
made
a
graceful
picture
in
the
morning
sunshine
and
reggie
byng
sighting
her
from
the
terrace
wobbled
in
his
tracks
turned
pink
and
lost
the
thread
of
his
remarks
the
sudden
appearance
of
alice
faraday
always
affected
him
like
that
i
have
copied
out
the
notes
you
made
last
night
lord
marshmoreton
i
typed
two
copies
alice
faraday
spoke
in
a
quiet
respectful
yet
subtly
authoritative
voice
she
was
a
girl
of
great
character
previous
employers
of
her
services
as
secretary
had
found
her
a
jewel
to
lord
marshmoreton
she
was
rapidly
becoming
a
perfect
incubus
their
views
on
the
relative
importance
of
gardening
and
family
histories
did
not
coincide
to
him
the
history
of
the
marshmoreton
family
was
the
occupation
of
the
idle
hour
she
seemed
to
think
that
he
ought
to
regard
it
as
a
she
was
always
coming
and
digging
him
out
of
the
garden
and
dragging
him
back
to
what
should
have
been
a
purely
task
it
was
lord
marshmoreton
habit
when
he
awoke
after
one
of
his
naps
too
late
to
resume
work
to
throw
out
some
vague
promise
of
attending
to
it
tomorrow
but
he
reflected
bitterly
the
girl
ought
to
have
tact
and
sense
to
understand
that
this
was
only
polite
persiflage
and
not
to
be
taken
literally
they
are
very
rough
continued
alice
addressing
her
conversation
to
the
seat
of
his
lordship
corduroy
trousers
lord
marshmoreton
always
assumed
a
stooping
attitude
when
he
saw
miss
faraday
approaching
with
papers
in
her
hand
for
he
laboured
under
a
pathetic
delusion
of
which
no
amount
of
failures
could
rid
him
that
if
she
did
not
see
his
face
she
would
withdraw
you
remember
last
night
you
promised
you
would
attend
to
them
this
morning
she
paused
long
enough
to
receive
a
grunt
by
way
of
answer
of
course
if
you
busy
she
said
placidly
with
a
at
lady
caroline
that
masterful
woman
could
always
be
counted
on
as
an
ally
in
these
little
encounters
nothing
of
the
kind
said
lady
caroline
crisply
she
was
still
ruffled
by
the
lack
of
attention
which
her
recent
utterances
had
received
and
welcomed
the
chance
of
administering
discipline
get
up
at
once
john
and
go
in
and
work
i
am
working
pleaded
lord
marshmoreton
despite
his
years
his
sister
caroline
still
had
the
power
at
times
to
make
him
feel
like
a
small
boy
she
had
been
a
great
martinet
in
the
days
of
their
mutual
nursery
the
family
history
is
more
important
than
grubbing
about
in
the
dirt
i
can
not
understand
why
you
do
not
leave
this
sort
of
thing
to
macpherson
why
you
should
pay
him
liberal
wages
and
then
do
his
work
for
him
i
can
not
see
you
know
the
publishers
are
waiting
for
the
history
go
and
attend
to
these
notes
at
once
you
promised
you
would
attend
to
them
this
morning
lord
marshmoreton
said
alice
invitingly
lord
marshmoreton
clung
to
his
can
of
solution
with
the
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
none
knew
better
than
he
that
these
interviews
especially
when
caroline
was
present
to
lend
the
weight
of
her
dominating
personality
always
ended
in
the
same
way
yes
yes
yes
he
said
tonight
perhaps
after
dinner
eh
yes
after
dinner
that
will
be
capital
i
think
you
ought
to
attend
to
them
this
morning
said
alice
gently
persistent
it
really
perturbed
this
girl
to
feel
that
she
was
not
doing
work
enough
to
merit
her
generous
salary
and
on
the
subject
of
the
history
of
the
marshmoreton
family
she
was
an
enthusiast
it
had
a
glamour
for
her
lord
marshmoreton
fingers
relaxed
their
hold
throughout
the
hundreds
of
spared
thrips
went
on
with
their
morning
meal
unwitting
of
doom
averted
oh
all
right
all
right
all
right
come
into
the
library
very
well
lord
marshmoreton
miss
faraday
turned
to
lady
caroline
i
have
been
looking
up
the
trains
lady
caroline
the
best
is
the
it
has
a
and
stops
at
belpher
if
signalled

you
going

caroline
inquired
lord
marshmoreton
hopefully
i
am
giving
a
short
talk
to
the
social
progress
league
at
lewisham
i
shall
return
tomorrow
oh
said
marshmoreton
hope
fading
from
his
voice
thank

miss
faraday
said
lady
caroline
the
the
motor
will
be
round
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
thank
you
oh
by
the
way
miss
faraday
will
you
call
to
reggie
as
you
pass
and
tell
him
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
maud
had
left
reggie
by
the
time
alice
faraday
reached
him
and
that
ardent
youth
was
sitting
on
a
stone
seat
smoking
a
cigarette
and
entertaining
himself
with
meditations
in
which
thoughts
of
alice
competed
for
precedence
with
graver
reflections
connected
with
the
subject
of
the
correct
stance
for
his
reggie
was
a
troubled
spirit
these
days
he
was
in
love
and
he
had
developed
a
bad
slice
with
his
he
was
practically
a
soul
in
torment
lady
caroline
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
she
wishes
to
speak
to
you
mr
byng
reggie
leaped
from
his
seat
there
you
are
i
mean
to
say
what
he
was
conscious
as
was
his
custom
in
her
presence
of
a
warm
prickly
sensation
in
the
small
of
the
back
some
kind
of
elephantiasis
seemed
to
have
attacked
his
hands
and
feet
swelling
them
to
enormous
proportions
he
wished
profoundly
that
he
could
get
rid
of
his
habit
of
yelping
with
nervous
laughter
whenever
he
encountered
the
girl
of
his
dreams
it
was
calculated
to
give
her
a
wrong
impression
of
a
chap
make
her
think
him
a
fearful
chump
and
what
not
lady
caroline
is
leaving
by
the
that
good
what
i
mean
to
say
is
oh
she
is
is
she
i
see
what
you
mean
the
absolute
necessity
of
saying
something
at
least
moderately
coherent
gripped
him
he
rallied
his
forces
you
would
care
to
come
for
a
stroll
after
i
seen
the
mater
or
a
row
on
the
lake
or
any
rot
like
that
would
you
thank
you
very
much
but
i
must
go
in
and
help
lord
marshmoreton
with
his
book
what
a
rotten
i
mean
what
a
dam
shame
the
pity
of
it
tore
at
reggie
heart
strings
he
burned
with
generous
wrath
against
lord
marshmoreton
that
modern
simon
legree
who
used
his
capitalistic
power
to
make
a
slave
of
this
girl
and
keep
her
toiling
indoors
when
all
the
world
was
sunshine
shall
i
go
and
ask
him
if
you
ca
put
it
off
till
after
dinner
oh
no
thanks
very
much
i
sure
lord
marshmoreton
dream
of
it
she
passed
on
with
a
pleasant
smile
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
effect
of
this
reggie
proceeded
slowly
to
the
upper
level
to
meet
his
hullo
mater
pretty
fit
and
so
forth
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
about
well
reggie
what
is
the
news
eh
what
news
did
you
get
hold
of
a
paper
at
breakfast
nothing
much
in
it
tam
duggan
beat
alec
fraser
three
up
and
two
to
play
at
prestwick
i
did
notice
anything
else
much
there
a
new
musical
comedy
at
the
regal
opened
last
night
and
seems
to
be
just
like
mother
makes
the
morning
post
gave
it
a
topping
notice
i
must
trickle
up
to
town
and
see
it
some
time
this
week
lady
caroline
frowned
this
slowness
in
the
uptake
coming
so
soon
after
her
brother
inattention
displeased
her
no
no
no
i
mean
you
and
maud
have
been
talking
to
each
other
for
quite
a
long
time
and
she
seemed
very
interested
in
what
you
were
saying
i
hoped
you
might
have
some
good
news
for
me
reggie
face
brightened
he
caught
her
drift
oh
ah
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
no
there
was
anything
of
that
sort
or
shape
or
order
what
were
you
saying
to
her
then
that
interested
her
so
much
i
was
explaining
how
i
landed
dead
on
the
pin
with
my
spoon
out
of
a
at
the
eleventh
hole
yesterday
it
certainly
was
a
pretty
ripe
shot
considering
i
sliced
into
this
baby
bunker
do
you
know
i
simply
ca
keep
straight
with
the
iron
nowadays
and
there
the
pill
was
grinning
up
at
me
from
the
sand
of
course
strictly
speaking
i
ought
to
have
used
a
niblick
but
do
you
mean
to
say
reggie
that
with
such
an
excellent
opportunity
you
did
not
ask
maud
to
marry
you
i
see
what
you
mean
well
as
a
matter
of
absolute
fact
i
as
it
were
did
lady
caroline
uttered
a
wordless
sound
by
the
way
mater
said
reggie
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
that
it
all
off
what
absolutely
you
see
it
appears
there
a
chappie
unknown
for
whom
maud
has
an
absolute
pash
it
seems
she
met
this
sportsman
up
in
wales
last
summer
she
was
caught
in
the
rain
and
he
happened
to
be
passing
and
rallied
round
with
his
and
one
thing
led
to
another
always
raining
in
wales
what
good
fishing
though
here
and
there
well
what
i
mean
is
this
cove
was
so
deucedly
civil
and
all
that
that
now
she
wo
look
at
anybody
else
the
boy
and
everybody
else
is
an
with
about
as
much
chance
as
a
blind
man
with
one
arm
trying
to
get
out
of
a
bunker
with
a
what
perfect
nonsense
i
know
all
about
that
affair
it
was
just
a
passing
fancy
that
never
meant
anything
maud
has
got
over
that
long
ago
she
did
seem
to
think
so
now
reggie
said
lady
caroline
tensely
please
listen
to
me
you
know
that
the
castle
will
be
full
of
people
in
a
day
or
two
for
percy
and
this
next
few
days
may
be
your
last
chance
of
having
a
real
long
private
talk
with
maud
i
shall
be
seriously
annoyed
if
you
neglect
this
opportunity
there
is
no
excuse
for
the
way
you
are
behaving
maud
is
a
charming
girl
oh
absolutely
one
of
the
best
very
well
then
but
mater
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
do
want
any
more
temporizing
reggie
no
no
absolutely
not
said
reggie
dutifully
wishing
he
knew
what
the
word
meant
and
wishing
also
that
life
had
not
become
so
frightfully
complex
now
this
afternoon
why
should
you
not
take
maud
for
a
long
ride
in
your
car
reggie
grew
more
cheerful
at
least
he
had
an
answer
for
that
ca
be
done
i
afraid
i
got
to
motor
into
town
to
meet
percy
he
arriving
from
oxford
this
morning
i
promised
to
meet
him
in
town
and
tool
him
back
in
the
car
i
see
well
then
why
could
you
i
say
mater
dear
old
soul
said
reggie
hastily
i
think
better
tear
yourself
away
and
what
not
if
you
catching
the
you
ought
to
be
staggering
round
to
see
you
forgotten
anything
there
the
car
coming
round
now
i
wish
now
i
had
decided
to
go
by
a
later
train
no
no
must
miss
the
good
fruity
train
everybody
speaks
well
of
it
well
see
you
anon
mater
i
think
you
better
run
like
a
hare
you
will
remember
what
i
said
oh
absolutely
then
i
shall
be
back
tomorrow
reggie
returned
slowly
to
his
stone
seat
he
breathed
a
little
heavily
as
he
felt
for
his
cigarette
case
he
felt
like
a
hunted
fawn
maud
came
out
of
the
house
as
the
car
disappeared
down
the
long
avenue
of
elms
she
crossed
the
terrace
to
where
reggie
sat
brooding
on
life
and
its
problem
reggie
reggie
turned
hullo
maud
dear
old
thing
take
a
seat
maud
sat
down
beside
him
there
was
a
flush
on
her
pretty
face
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
quivered
with
suppressed
excitement
reggie
she
said
laying
a
small
hand
on
his
arm
we
friends
are
we
reggie
patted
her
back
paternally
there
were
few
people
he
liked
better
than
maud
always
have
been
since
the
dear
old
days
of
childhood
what
i
can
trust
you
ca
i
absolutely
there
something
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
reggie
you
have
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
of
course
the
strong
silent
man
that
me
what
is
it
you
driving
into
town
in
your
car
this
afternoon
are
you
to
meet
percy
that
was
the
idea
could
you
go
this
morning
instead
and
take
me
of
course
maud
shook
her
head
you
do
know
what
you
are
letting
yourself
in
for
reggie
or
i
sure
you
would
agree
so
lightly
i
not
allowed
to
leave
the
castle
you
know
because
of
what
i
was
telling
you
about
the
chappie
yes
so
there
would
be
terrible
scenes
if
anybody
found
out
never
mind
dear
old
soul
i
risk
it
none
shall
learn
your
secret
from
these
lips
you
a
darling
reggie
but
what
the
idea
why
do
you
want
to
go
today
particularly
maud
looked
over
her
shoulder
because
she
lowered
her
voice
though
there
was
no
one
near
because
he
is
back
in
london
he
a
sort
of
secretary
you
know
reggie
to
his
uncle
and
i
saw
in
the
paper
this
morning
that
the
uncle
returned
yesterday
after
a
long
voyage
in
his
yacht
so
he
must
have
come
back
too
he
has
to
go
everywhere
his
uncle
goes
and
everywhere
the
uncle
went
the
chappie
was
sure
to
go
murmured
reggie
sorry
did
mean
to
interrupt
i
must
see
him
i
have
seen
him
since
last
summer
nearly
a
whole
year
and
he
has
written
to
me
and
i
have
dared
to
write
to
him
for
fear
of
the
letter
going
wrong
so
you
see
i
must
go
today
my
only
chance
aunt
caroline
has
gone
away
father
will
be
busy
in
the
garden
and
wo
notice
whether
here
or
not
and
besides
tomorrow
it
will
be
too
late
because
percy
will
be
here
he
was
more
furious
about
the
thing
than
anyone
rather
the
proud
aristocrat
percy
agreed
reggie
i
understand
absolutely
tell
me
just
what
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
to
pick
me
up
in
the
car
about
half
a
mile
down
the
road
you
can
drop
me
somewhere
in
piccadilly
that
will
be
near
enough
to
where
i
want
to
go
but
the
most
important
thing
is
about
percy
you
must
persuade
him
to
stay
and
dine
in
town
and
come
back
here
after
dinner
then
i
shall
be
able
to
get
back
by
an
afternoon
train
and
no
one
will
know
i
been
gone
that
simple
enough
what
consider
it
done
when
do
you
want
to
start
at
once
i
toddle
round
to
the
garage
and
fetch
the
car
reggie
chuckled
amusedly
rum
thing
the
mater
just
been
telling
me
i
ought
to
take
you
for
a
drive
you
are
a
darling
reggie
really
reggie
gave
her
back
another
paternal
pat
i
know
what
it
means
to
be
in
love
dear
old
soul
i
say
maud
old
thing
do
you
find
love
puts
you
off
your
stroke
what
i
mean
is
does
it
make
you
slice
your
maud
laughed
no
it
has
had
any
effect
on
my
game
so
far
i
went
round
in
the
other
day
reggie
sighed
enviously
women
are
wonderful
he
said
well
i
be
legging
it
and
fetching
the
car
when
you
ready
stroll
along
down
the
road
and
wait
for
me
when
he
had
gone
maud
pulled
a
small
newspaper
clipping
from
her
pocket
she
had
extracted
it
from
yesterday
copy
of
the
morning
post
society
column
it
contained
only
a
few
words
wilbur
raymond
has
returned
to
his
residence
at
no
belgrave
square
from
a
prolonged
voyage
in
his
yacht
the
siren
maud
did
not
know
wilbur
raymond
and
yet
that
paragraph
had
sent
the
blood
tingling
through
every
vein
in
her
body
for
as
she
had
indicated
to
reggie
when
the
wilbur
raymonds
of
this
world
return
to
their
town
residences
they
bring
with
them
their
nephew
and
secretary
geoffrey
raymond
and
geoffrey
raymond
was
the
man
maud
had
loved
ever
since
the
day
when
she
had
met
him
in
wales
chapter
the
sun
that
had
shone
so
brightly
on
belpher
castle
at
noon
when
maud
and
reggie
byng
set
out
on
their
journey
shone
on
the
of
london
with
equal
pleasantness
at
two
in
little
gooch
street
all
the
children
of
all
the
small
shopkeepers
who
support
life
in
that
backwater
by
selling
each
other
vegetables
and
singing
canaries
were
out
and
about
playing
curious
games
of
their
own
invention
cats
washed
themselves
on
doorsteps
preparatory
to
looking
in
for
lunch
at
one
of
the
numerous
garbage
cans
which
dotted
the
sidewalk
waiters
peered
austerely
from
the
windows
of
the
two
italian
restaurants
which
carry
on
the
lucretia
borgia
tradition
by
means
of
one
shilling
and
sixpenny
luncheons
the
proprietor
of
the
grocery
store
on
the
corner
was
bidding
a
silent
farewell
to
a
tomato
which
even
he
though
a
dauntless
optimist
had
been
compelled
to
recognize
as
having
outlived
its
utility
on
all
these
things
the
sun
shone
with
a
genial
smile
round
the
corner
in
shaftesbury
avenue
an
east
wind
was
doing
its
best
to
pierce
the
hardened
hides
of
the
citizenry
but
it
did
not
penetrate
into
little
gooch
street
which
facing
south
and
being
narrow
and
sheltered
was
enabled
practically
to
bask
mac
the
stout
guardian
of
the
stage
door
of
the
regal
theatre
whose
gilded
front
entrance
is
on
the
avenue
emerged
from
the
little
glass
case
in
which
the
management
kept
him
and
came
out
to
observe
life
and
its
phenomena
with
an
indulgent
eye
mac
was
feeling
happy
this
morning
his
job
was
a
permanent
one
not
influenced
by
the
success
or
failure
of
the
productions
which
followed
one
another
at
the
theatre
throughout
the
year
but
he
felt
nevertheless
a
sort
of
proprietary
interest
in
these
ventures
and
was
pleased
when
they
secured
the
approval
of
the
public
last
night
opening
a
musical
piece
by
an
american
author
and
composer
had
undoubtedly
made
a
big
hit
and
mac
was
glad
because
he
liked
what
he
had
seen
of
the
company
and
in
the
brief
time
in
which
he
had
known
him
had
come
to
entertain
a
warm
regard
for
george
bevan
the
composer
who
had
travelled
over
from
new
york
to
help
with
the
london
production
george
bevan
turned
the
corner
now
walking
slowly
and
it
seemed
to
mac
gloomily
towards
the
stage
door
he
was
a
young
man
of
about
tall
and
well
knit
with
an
agreeable
face
of
which
a
pair
of
good
and
honest
eyes
were
the
most
noticeable
feature
his
sensitive
mouth
was
drawn
down
a
little
at
the
corners
and
he
looked
tired
morning
mac
good
morning
sir
anything
for
me
yes
sir
some
telegrams
i
get
oh
i
said
mac
as
if
reassuring
some
doubting
friend
and
supporter
as
to
his
ability
to
carry
through
a
labour
of
hercules
he
disappeared
into
his
glass
case
george
bevan
remained
outside
in
the
street
surveying
the
frisking
children
with
a
sombre
glance
they
seemed
to
him
very
noisy
very
dirty
and
very
young
disgustingly
young
theirs
was
joyous
exuberant
youth
which
made
a
fellow
feel
at
least
sixty
something
was
wrong
with
george
today
for
normally
he
was
fond
of
children
indeed
normally
he
was
fond
of
most
things
he
was
a
and
cheerful
young
man
who
liked
life
and
the
great
majority
of
those
who
lived
it
contemporaneously
with
himself
he
had
no
enemies
and
many
friends
but
today
he
had
noticed
from
the
moment
he
had
got
out
of
bed
that
something
was
amiss
with
the
world
either
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
divine
discontent
due
to
the
highly
developed
condition
of
his
soul
or
else
he
had
a
grouch
one
of
the
two
or
it
might
have
been
the
reaction
from
the
emotions
of
the
previous
night
on
the
morning
after
an
opening
your
sensitive
artist
is
always
apt
to
feel
as
if
he
had
been
dried
over
a
barrel
besides
last
night
there
had
been
a
supper
party
after
the
performance
at
the
flat
which
the
comedian
of
the
troupe
had
rented
in
jermyn
street
a
forced
rowdy
supper
party
where
a
number
of
tired
people
with
nerves
had
seemed
to
feel
it
a
duty
to
be
artificially
vivacious
it
had
lasted
till
four
when
the
morning
papers
with
the
notices
arrived
and
george
had
not
got
to
bed
till
these
things
colour
the
mental
outlook
mac
reappeared
here
you
are
sir
thanks
george
put
the
telegrams
in
his
pocket
a
cat
on
its
way
back
from
lunch
paused
beside
him
in
order
to
use
his
leg
as
a
serviette
george
tickled
it
under
the
ear
abstractedly
he
was
always
courteous
to
cats
but
today
he
went
through
the
movements
perfunctorily
and
without
enthusiasm
the
cat
moved
on
mac
became
conversational
they
tell
me
the
piece
was
a
hit
last
night
sir
it
seemed
to
go
very
well
my
missus
saw
it
from
the
gallery
and
all
the
was
speaking
very
of
it
there
a
regular
click
you
know
sir
over
here
in
london
that
goes
to
all
the
first
nights
in
the
gallery
critical
they
are
always
specially

american
piece
like
this
one
if
they

like
it
they
precious
soon
let
you
know
my
missus
ses
they
was
all
speakin
very
of
it
my
missus
says
she
ai
seen
a
livelier
show
for
a
long
time
and
she
a
great
theatregoer
my
missus
says
they
was
all
specially
pleased
with
the
music
that
good
the
morning
leader
give
it
a
fine
how
was
the
rest
of
the
papers
splendid
all
of
them
i
have
seen
the
evening
papers
yet
i
came
out
to
get
them
mac
looked
down
the
street
there
be
a
rehearsal
this
afternoon
i
suppose
sir
miss
dore
coming
along
george
followed
his
glance
a
tall
girl
in
a
suit
of
blue
was
coming
towards
them
even
at
a
distance
one
caught
the
genial
personality
of
the
new
arrival
it
seemed
to
go
before
her
like
a
heartening
breeze
she
picked
her
way
carefully
through
the
children
crawling
on
the
side
walk
she
stopped
for
a
moment
and
said
something
to
one
of
them
the
child
grinned
even
the
proprietor
of
the
grocery
store
appeared
to
brighten
up
at
the
sight
of
her
as
at
the
sight
of
some
old
friend
how
business
bill
she
called
to
him
as
she
passed
the
spot
where
he
stood
brooding
on
the
mortality
of
tomatoes
and
though
he
replied
rotten
a
faint
grim
smile
did
nevertheless
flicker
across
his
tragic
mask
billie
dore
who
was
one
of
the
chorus
of
george
bevan
musical
comedy
had
an
attractive
face
a
mouth
that
laughed
readily
rather
bright
golden
hair
which
she
was
fond
of
insisting
with
perfect
truth
was
genuine
though
appearances
were
against
it
and
steady
blue
eyes
the
latter
were
frequently
employed
by
her
in
quelling
admirers
who
were
encouraged
by
the
former
to
become
too
ardent
billie
views
on
the
opposite
sex
who
forgot
themselves
were
as
rigid
as
those
of
lord
marshmoreton
concerning
thrips
she
liked
men
and
she
would
signify
this
liking
in
a
practical
manner
by
lunching
and
dining
with
them
but
she
was
entirely
and
when
men
overlooked
that
fact
she
reminded
them
of
it
in
no
uncertain
voice
for
she
was
a
girl
of
ready
speech
and
direct
george
mac
any
mail
i
see
miss
how
did
your
better
like
the
show
mac
i
was
just
telling
bevan
miss
that
the
missus
said
she
seen
a
livelier
show
for
a
long
time
fine
i
knew
i
be
a
hit
well
george
how
the
boy
this
bright
afternoon
limp
and
pessimistic
that
comes
of
sitting
up
till
four
in
the
morning
with
festive
hams
you
were
up
as
late
as
i
was
and
you
look
like
little
eva
after
a
night
of
sweet
childish
slumber
yes
but
i
drank
ginger
ale
and
did
smoke
eighteen
cigars
and
yet
i
do
know
i
think
i
must
be
getting
old
george
parties
seem
to
have
lost
their
charm
i
was
ready
to
quit
at
one
but
it
did
seem
matey
i
think
i
marry
a
farmer
and
settle
down
george
was
amazed
he
had
not
expected
to
find
his
present
view
of
life
shared
in
this
quarter
i
was
just
thinking
myself
he
said
feeling
not
for
the
first
time
how
different
billie
was
from
the
majority
of
those
with
whom
his
profession
brought
him
in
contact
how
flat
it
all
was
the
show
business
i
mean
and
these
darned
first
nights
and
the
party
after
the
show
which
you
ca
sidestep
something
tells
me
about
through
billie
dore
nodded
anybody
with
any
sense
is
always
about
through
with
the
show
business
i
know
i
am
if
you
think
i
wedded
to
my
art
let
me
tell
you
i
going
to
get
a
divorce
the
first
chance
that
comes
along
it
funny
about
the
show
business
the
way
one
drifts
into
it
and
sticks
i
mean
take
me
for
example
nature
had
it
all
doped
out
for
me
to
be
the
belle
of
hicks
corners
what
i
ought
to
have
done
was
to
buy
a
gingham
bonnet
and
milk
cows
but
i
would
come
to
the
great
city
and
help
brighten
up
the
tired
business
man
i
did
know
you
were
fond
of
the
country
billie
me
i
wrote
the
words
and
music
did
you
know
i
was
a
country
kid
my
dad
ran
a
bide
a
wee
home
for
flowers
and
i
used
to
know
them
all
by
their
middle
names
he
was
a
nursery
gardener
out
in
indiana
i
tell
you
when
i
see
a
rose
nowadays
i
shake
its
hand
and
say
well
cyril
how
everything
with
you
and
how
are
joe
and
jack
and
jimmy
and
all
the
rest
of
the
boys
at
home
do
you
know
how
i
used
to
put
in
my
time
the
first
few
nights
i
was
over
here
in
london
i
used
to
hang
around
covent
garden
with
my
head
back
sniffing
the
boys
that
mess
about
with
the
flowers
there
used
to
stub
their
toes
on
me
so
often
that
they
got
to
look
on
me
as
part
of
the
scenery
that
where
we
ought
to
have
been
last
night
we
have
had
a
better
time
say
george
did
you
see
the
awful
mistake
on
nature
part
that
babe
sinclair
showed
up
with
towards
the
middle
of
the
proceedings
you
must
have
noticed
him
because
he
took
up
more
room
than
any
one
man
was
entitled
to
his
name
was
spenser
gray
george
recalled
having
been
introduced
to
a
fat
man
of
his
own
age
who
answered
to
that
name
it
a
darned
shame
said
billie
indignantly
babe
is
only
a
kid
this
is
the
first
show
she
been
in
and
i
happen
to
know
there
an
awfully
nice
boy
over
in
new
york
crazy
to
marry
her
and
i
certain
this
gink
is
giving
her
a
raw
deal
he
tried
to
get
hold
of
me
about
a
week
ago
but
i
turned
him
down
hard
and
i
suppose
he
thinks
babe
is
easier
and
it
no
good
talking
to
her
she
thinks
he
wonderful
that
another
kick
i
have
against
the
show
business
it
seems
to
make
girls
such
darned
chumps
well
i
wonder
how
much
longer
arbuckle
is
going
to
be
retrieving
my
mail
what
ho
within
there
fatty
mac
came
out
apologetic
carrying
letters
sorry
miss
by
an
oversight
i
put
you
among
the
g
all
well
that
ends
well
me
among
the
g
there
a
good
title
for
a
song
for
you
george
excuse
me
while
i
grapple
with
the
correspondence
i
bet
half
of
these
are
mash
notes
i
got
three
between
the
first
and
second
acts
last
night
why
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
this
burg
should
think
that
i
their
affinity
just
because
i
got
golden
hair
which
is
perfectly
genuine
mac
i
can
show
you
the
pedigree
and
because
i
earn
an
honest
living
singing
off
the
key
is
more
than
i
can
understand
mac
leaned
his
massive
shoulders
comfortably
against
the
building
and
resumed
his
chat
i
expect
you
feeling
very
today
sir
george
pondered
he
was
certainly
feeling
better
since
he
had
seen
billie
dore
but
he
was
far
from
being
himself
i
ought
to
be
i
suppose
but
i
not
ah
you
getting
blarzy
sir
that
what
it
is
you
too
much
of
the
fat
you
this
piece
was
a
big
in
america
was
it
yes
it
ran
over
a
year
in
new
york
and
there
are
three
companies
of
it
out
now
that
it
is
you
see
you
gone
and
got
blarzy
too
big
a
of
success
you
mac
wagged
a
head
like
a
harvest
moon
you
are
a
married
man
are
you
sir
billie
dore
finished
skimming
through
her
mail
and
crumpled
the
letters
up
into
a
large
ball
which
she
handed
to
mac
here
something
for
you
to
read
in
your
spare
moments
mac
glance
through
them
any
time
you
have
a
suspicion
you
may
be
a
chump
and
you
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
there
are
others
what
were
you
saying
about
being
married
bevan
and
i
was
a
talk
about
being
blarzy
miss
are
you
blarzy
george
so
mac
says
and
why
is
he
blarzy
miss
demanded
mac
rhetorically
do
ask
me
said
billie
it
not
my
fault
it
because
as
i
was
saying
too
big
a
of
success
and
because
ai
a
married
man
you
did
say
you
a
married
man
did
you
sir
i
did
but
i
not
that
it
is
you
see
you
pretty
soon
gets
sick
of
pulling
off
good
things
if
you
ai
got
nobody
to
pat
you
on
the
back
for
doing
of
it
why
when
i
was
single
if
i
got
of
a
sure
thing
for
the
three
race
and
picked
up
a
couple
of
quid
the
thrill
of
it
did
seem
to
linger
somehow
but
now
if
some
of
the
gentlemen
that
come
put
me
on
to
something
safe
and
i
make
a
bit
the
fascination
of
it
is
taking
the
stuff
and
rolling
it
on
to
the
kitchen
table
and
pat
me
on
the
back
how
about
when
you
lose
i
do
tell
said
mac
simply
you
seem
to
understand
the
art
of
being
happy
mac
it
ai
an
art
sir
it
just
gettin
of
the
right
little
woman
and
a
nice
little
of
your
own
to
go
back
to
at
night
mac
said
billie
admiringly
you
talk
like
a
tin
pan
alley
song
hit
except
that
you
left
out
the
scent
of
honeysuckle
and
old
mister
moon
climbing
up
over
the
trees
well
you
quite
right
i
all
for
the
simple
and
domestic
myself
if
i
could
find
the
right
man
and
he
did
see
me
coming
and
duck
i
become
one
of
the
mendelssohn
march
daughters
right
away
are
you
going
george
there
a
rehearsal
at
for
cuts
i
want
to
get
the
evening
papers
and
send
off
a
cable
or
two
see
you
later
we
shall
meet
at
philippi
mac
eyed
george
retreating
back
till
he
had
turned
the
corner
a
nice
pleasant
gentleman
bevan
he
said
too
bad
got
the
pip
the
way
just
after
a
big
success
like
this
comes
of
bein
a
artist
i
suppose
miss
dore
dived
into
her
vanity
case
and
produced
a
puff
with
which
she
proceeded
to
powder
her
nose
all
composers
are
nuts
mac
i
was
in
a
show
once
where
the
manager
was
panning
the
composer
because
there
was
a
number
in
the
score
that
had
a
tune
to
it
the
poor
geek
admitted
they
were
very
tuney
but
said
the
thing
about
his
music
was
that
it
had
such
a
wonderful
aroma
they
all
get
that
way
the
jazz
seems
to
go
to
their
heads
george
is
all
right
though
and
do
let
anyone
tell
you
different
have
you
know
him
long
miss
about
five
years
i
was
a
stenographer
in
the
house
that
published
his
songs
when
i
first
met
him
and
there
another
thing
got
to
hand
it
to
george
for
he
has
let
success
give
him
a
swelled
head
the
money
that
boy
makes
is
sinful
mac
he
wears
thousand
dollar
bills
next
to
his
skin
winter
and
summer
but
just
the
same
as
he
was
when
i
first
knew
him
when
he
was
just
hanging
around
broadway
looking
out
for
a
chance
to
be
allowed
to
slip
a
couple
of
interpolated
numbers
into
any
old
show
that
came
along
yes
put
it
in
your
diary
mac
and
write
it
on
your
cuff
george
bevan
all
right
he
an
ace
unconscious
of
these
eulogies
which
coming
from
one
whose
judgment
he
respected
might
have
cheered
him
up
george
wandered
down
shaftesbury
avenue
feeling
more
depressed
than
ever
the
sun
had
gone
in
for
the
time
being
and
the
east
wind
was
frolicking
round
him
like
a
playful
puppy
patting
him
with
a
cold
paw
nuzzling
his
ankles
bounding
away
and
bounding
back
again
and
behaving
generally
as
east
winds
do
when
they
discover
a
victim
who
has
come
out
without
his
spring
overcoat
it
was
plain
to
george
now
that
the
sun
and
the
wind
were
a
couple
of
confidence
tricksters
working
together
as
a
team
the
sun
had
disarmed
him
with
specious
promises
and
an
air
of
cheery
goodfellowship
and
had
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
the
wind
which
was
now
going
through
him
with
the
swift
thoroughness
of
the
professional
artist
he
quickened
his
steps
and
began
to
wonder
if
he
was
so
sunk
in
senile
decay
as
to
have
acquired
a
liver
he
discarded
the
theory
as
repellent
and
yet
there
must
be
a
reason
for
his
depression
today
of
all
days
as
mac
had
pointed
out
he
had
everything
to
make
him
happy
popular
as
he
was
in
america
this
was
the
first
piece
of
his
to
be
produced
in
london
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
success
of
unusual
dimensions
and
yet
he
felt
no
elation
he
reached
piccadilly
and
turned
westwards
and
then
as
he
passed
the
gates
of
the
in
and
out
club
he
had
a
moment
of
clear
vision
and
understood
everything
he
was
depressed
because
he
was
bored
and
he
was
bored
because
he
was
lonely
mac
that
solid
thinker
had
been
right
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
life
was
to
get
hold
of
the
right
girl
and
have
a
home
to
go
back
to
at
night
he
was
mildly
surprised
that
he
had
tried
in
any
other
direction
for
an
explanation
of
his
gloom
it
was
all
the
more
inexplicable
in
that
fully
per
cent
of
the
lyrics
which
he
had
set
in
the
course
of
his
musical
comedy
career
had
had
that
thought
at
the
back
of
them
george
gave
himself
up
to
an
orgy
of
sentimentality
he
seemed
to
be
alone
in
the
world
which
had
paired
itself
off
into
a
sort
of
seething
welter
of
happy
couples
taxicabs
full
of
happy
couples
rolled
by
every
minute
passing
omnibuses
creaked
beneath
the
weight
of
happy
couples
the
very
policeman
across
the
street
had
just
grinned
at
a
flitting
shop
girl
and
she
had
smiled
back
at
him
the
only
female
in
london
who
did
not
appear
to
be
attached
was
a
girl
in
brown
who
was
coming
along
the
sidewalk
at
a
leisurely
pace
looking
about
her
in
a
manner
that
suggested
that
she
found
piccadilly
a
new
and
stimulating
spectacle
as
far
as
george
could
see
she
was
an
extremely
pretty
girl
small
and
dainty
with
a
proud
little
tilt
to
her
head
and
the
jaunty
walk
that
spoke
of
perfect
health
she
was
in
fact
precisely
the
sort
of
girl
that
george
felt
he
could
love
with
all
the
devotion
of
an
old
buffer
of
who
had
squandered
none
of
his
rich
nature
in
foolish
flirtations
he
had
just
begun
to
weave
a
romance
about
their
two
selves
when
a
cold
reaction
set
in
even
as
he
paused
to
watch
the
girl
threading
her
way
through
the
crowd
the
east
wind
jabbed
an
icy
finger
down
the
back
of
his
neck
and
the
chill
of
it
sobered
him
after
all
he
reflected
bitterly
this
girl
was
only
alone
because
she
was
on
her
way
somewhere
to
meet
some
confounded
man
besides
there
was
no
earthly
chance
of
getting
to
know
her
you
ca
rush
up
to
pretty
girls
in
the
street
and
tell
them
you
are
lonely
at
least
you
can
but
it
does
get
you
anywhere
except
the
police
station
george
gloom
deepened
a
thing
he
would
not
have
believed
possible
a
moment
before
he
felt
that
he
had
been
born
too
late
the
restraints
of
modern
civilization
irked
him
it
was
not
he
told
himself
like
this
in
the
good
old
days
in
the
middle
ages
for
example
this
girl
would
have
been
a
damsel
and
in
that
happy
time
practically
everybody
whose
technical
rating
was
that
of
damsel
was
in
distress
and
only
too
willing
to
waive
the
formalities
in
return
for
services
rendered
by
the
casual
but
the
twentieth
century
is
a
prosaic
age
when
girls
are
merely
girls
and
have
no
troubles
at
all
were
he
to
stop
this
girl
in
brown
and
assure
her
that
his
aid
and
comfort
were
at
her
disposal
she
would
undoubtedly
call
that
large
policeman
from
across
the
way
and
the
romance
would
begin
and
end
within
the
space
of
thirty
seconds
or
if
the
policeman
were
a
quick
mover
rather
less
better
to
dismiss
dreams
and
return
to
the
practical
side
of
life
by
buying
the
evening
papers
from
the
shabby
individual
beside
him
who
had
just
thrust
an
early
edition
in
his
face
after
all
notices
are
notices
even
when
the
heart
is
aching
george
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
necessary
money
found
emptiness
and
remembered
that
he
had
left
all
his
ready
funds
at
his
hotel
it
was
just
one
of
the
things
he
might
have
expected
on
a
day
like
this
the
man
with
the
papers
had
the
air
of
one
whose
business
is
conducted
on
purely
cash
principles
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
return
to
the
hotel
retrieve
his
money
and
try
to
forget
the
weight
of
the
world
and
its
cares
in
lunch
and
from
the
hotel
he
could
despatch
the
two
or
three
cables
which
he
wanted
to
send
to
new
york
the
girl
in
brown
was
quite
close
now
and
george
was
enabled
to
get
a
clearer
glimpse
of
her
she
more
than
fulfilled
the
promise
she
had
given
at
a
distance
had
she
been
constructed
to
his
own
specifications
she
would
not
have
been
more
acceptable
in
sight
and
now
she
was
going
out
of
his
life
for
ever
with
an
overwhelming
sense
of
pathos
for
there
is
no
pathos
more
bitter
than
that
of
parting
from
someone
we
have
never
met
george
hailed
a
taxicab
which
crawled
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
with
all
the
refrains
of
all
the
sentimental
song
hits
he
had
ever
composed
ringing
in
his
ears
he
got
in
and
passed
away
a
rotten
world
he
mused
as
the
cab
after
proceeding
a
couple
of
yards
came
to
a
standstill
in
a
block
of
the
traffic
a
dull
flat
bore
of
a
world
in
which
nothing
happens
or
ever
will
happen
even
when
you
take
a
cab
it
just
sticks
and
does
move
at
this
point
the
door
of
the
cab
opened
and
the
girl
in
brown
jumped
in
i
so
sorry
she
said
breathlessly
but
would
you
mind
hiding
me
please
chapter
george
hid
her
he
did
it
too
without
wasting
precious
time
by
asking
questions
in
a
situation
which
might
well
have
thrown
the
of
men
off
his
balance
he
acted
with
promptitude
intelligence
and
despatch
the
fact
is
george
had
for
years
been
an
assiduous
golfer
and
there
is
no
finer
school
for
teaching
concentration
and
a
strict
attention
to
the
matter
in
hand
few
crises
however
unexpected
have
the
power
to
disturb
a
man
who
has
so
conquered
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
as
to
have
trained
himself
to
bend
his
left
knee
raise
his
left
heel
swing
his
arms
well
out
from
the
body
twist
himself
into
the
shape
of
a
corkscrew
and
use
the
muscle
of
the
wrist
at
the
same
time
keeping
his
head
still
and
his
eye
on
the
ball
it
is
estimated
that
there
are
important
points
to
be
borne
in
mind
simultaneously
while
making
a
drive
at
golf
and
to
the
man
who
has
mastered
the
art
of
remembering
them
all
the
task
of
hiding
girls
in
taxicabs
is
mere
child
play
to
pull
down
the
blinds
on
the
side
of
the
vehicle
nearest
the
kerb
was
with
george
the
work
of
a
moment
then
he
leaned
out
of
the
centre
window
in
such
a
manner
as
completely
to
screen
the
interior
of
the
cab
from
public
view
thank
you
so
much
murmured
a
voice
behind
him
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
floor
not
at
all
said
george
trying
a
sort
of
vocal
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
designed
to
lift
his
voice
backwards
and
lay
it
dead
inside
the
cab
he
gazed
upon
piccadilly
with
eyes
from
which
the
scales
had
fallen
reason
told
him
that
he
was
still
in
piccadilly
otherwise
it
would
have
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
this
could
be
the
same
street
which
a
moment
before
he
had
passed
judgment
upon
and
found
flat
and
uninteresting
true
in
its
salient
features
it
had
altered
little
the
same
number
of
people
moved
up
and
down
the
buildings
retained
their
air
of
not
having
had
a
bath
since
the
days
of
the
tudors
the
east
wind
still
blew
but
though
superficially
the
same
in
reality
piccadilly
had
altered
completely
before
it
had
been
just
piccadilly
now
it
was
a
golden
street
in
the
city
of
romance
a
main
thoroughfare
of
bagdad
one
of
the
principal
arteries
of
the
capital
of
fairyland
a
mist
swam
before
george
eyes
his
spirits
so
low
but
a
few
moments
back
soared
like
a
good
niblick
shot
out
of
the
bunker
of
gloom
the
years
fell
away
from
him
till
in
an
instant
from
being
a
rather
poorly
preserved
liverish
greybeard
of
or
so
he
became
a
sprightly
lad
of
in
a
world
of
springtime
and
flowers
and
laughing
brooks
in
other
words
taking
it
by
and
large
george
felt
pretty
good
the
impossible
had
happened
heaven
had
sent
him
an
adventure
and
he
did
care
if
it
snowed
it
was
possibly
the
mist
before
his
eyes
that
prevented
him
from
observing
the
hurried
approach
of
a
faultlessly
attired
young
man
aged
about
who
during
preparations
for
ensuring
privacy
in
his
cab
had
been
galloping
in
pursuit
in
a
resolute
manner
that
suggested
a
bloodhound
somewhat
overfed
and
out
of
condition
only
when
this
person
stopped
and
began
to
pant
within
a
few
inches
of
his
face
did
he
become
aware
of
his
existence
you
sir
said
the
bloodhound
removing
a
gleaming
silk
hat
mopping
a
pink
forehead
and
replacing
the
luminous
superstructure
once
more
in
position
you
sir
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
possibility
of
love
at
first
sight
in
which
theory
george
was
now
a
confirmed
believer
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
an
exactly
opposite
phenomenon
is
of
frequent
occurrence
after
one
look
at
some
people
even
friendship
is
impossible
such
a
one
in
george
opinion
was
this
gurgling
excrescence
underneath
the
silk
hat
he
comprised
in
his
single
person
practically
all
the
qualities
which
george
disliked
most
he
was
for
a
young
man
extraordinarily
obese
already
a
second
edition
of
his
chin
had
been
published
and
the
morning
coat
which
encased
his
upper
section
bulged
out
in
an
opulent
he
wore
a
little
moustache
which
to
prejudiced
eye
seemed
more
a
complaint
than
a
moustache
his
face
was
red
his
manner
dictatorial
and
he
was
touched
in
the
wind
take
him
for
all
in
all
he
looked
like
a
bit
of
bad
news
george
had
been
educated
at
lawrenceville
and
harvard
and
had
subsequently
had
the
privilege
of
mixing
socially
with
many
of
new
york
most
prominent
theatrical
managers
so
he
knew
how
to
behave
himself
no
vere
de
vere
could
have
exhibited
greater
repose
of
manner
and
what
he
inquired
suavely
leaning
a
little
further
out
of
the
cab
is
eating
you
bill
a
messenger
boy
two
shabby
men
engaged
in
industries
and
a
shop
girl
paused
to
observe
the
scene
time
was
not
of
the
essence
to
these
confirmed
sightseers
the
shop
girl
was
late
already
so
it
did
matter
if
she
was
any
later
the
messenger
boy
had
nothing
on
hand
except
a
message
marked
important
rush
and
as
for
the
two
shabby
men
their
only
immediate
plans
consisted
of
a
vague
intention
of
getting
to
some
public
house
and
leaning
against
the
wall
so
george
time
was
their
time
one
of
the
pair
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
said
what
ho
the
other
picked
up
a
cigar
stub
from
the
gutter
and
began
to
smoke
a
young
lady
just
got
into
your
cab
said
the
stout
young
man
surely
not
said
george
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
surely
not
i
been
in
the
cab
all
the
time
and
i
should
have
noticed
it
at
this
juncture
the
block
in
the
traffic
was
relieved
and
the
cab
bowled
smartly
on
for
some
fifty
yards
when
it
was
again
halted
george
protruding
from
the
window
like
a
snail
was
entertained
by
the
spectacle
of
the
pursuit
the
hunt
was
up
short
of
throwing
his
head
up
and
baying
the
stout
young
man
behaved
exactly
as
a
bloodhound
in
similar
circumstances
would
have
conducted
itself
he
broke
into
a
jerky
gallop
attended
by
his
associates
and
considering
that
the
young
man
was
so
stout
that
the
messenger
boy
considered
it
unprofessional
to
hurry
that
the
shop
girl
had
doubts
as
to
whether
sprinting
was
quite
ladylike
and
that
the
two
bohemians
were
moving
at
a
quicker
gait
than
a
shuffle
for
the
first
occasion
in
eleven
years
the
cavalcade
made
good
time
the
cab
was
still
stationary
when
they
arrived
in
a
body
here
he
is
said
the
messenger
boy
removing
a
bead
of
perspiration
with
the
rush
message
here
he
is
said
the
bohemian
what
oh
here
i
am
agreed
george
affably
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
smoker
spat
appreciatively
at
a
passing
dog
the
point
seemed
to
him
well
taken
not
for
many
a
day
had
he
so
enjoyed
himself
in
an
arid
world
containing
too
few
goes
of
gin
and
too
many
policemen
a
world
in
which
the
poor
were
oppressed
and
could
seldom
even
enjoy
a
quiet
cigar
without
having
their
fingers
trodden
upon
he
found
himself
for
the
moment
contented
happy
and
expectant
this
looked
like
a
row
between
toffs
and
of
all
things
which
most
intrigued
him
a
row
between
toffs
ranked
highest
r
he
said
approvingly
now
you

the
shop
girl
had
espied
an
acquaintance

the
crowd

accompanied
by
perhaps
a

more
of

millions
added
herself
to
the
audience
these
all
belonged
to
the
class
which
will
gather
round
and
watch
silently
while
a
motorist
mends
a
tyre
they
are
not
impatient
they
do
not
call
for
rapid
and
continuous
action
a
mere
hole
in
the
ground
which
of
all
sights
is
perhaps
the
least
vivid
and
dramatic
is
enough
to
grip
their
attention
for
hours
at
a
time
they
stared
at
george
and
george
cab
with
unblinking
gaze
they
did
not
know
what
would
happen
or
when
it
would
happen
but
they
intended
to
wait
till
something
did
happen
it
might
be
for
years
or
it
might
be
for
ever
but
they
meant
to
be
there
when
things
began
to
occur
speculations
became
audible
wot
is
it
nah
gent
pocket
picked
two
toffs
a
scrap
feller
bilked
the
cabman
a
sceptic
made
a
cynical
suggestion
they
doin
of
it
for
the
pictures
the
idea
gained
instant
popularity
jear
that
it
a
fillum
wot
o
charlie
the
kemerer
in
the
keb
wot
they
be
up
to
next
a
spectator
with
a
tray
of
harnessed
to
his
stomach
started
another
school
of
thought
he
spoke
with
decision
as
one
having
authority
nothin
of
the
blinkin
kind
the
fat
bin
one
or
two
around
the
corner
and
it
gorn
and
got
into
the
driver
of
the
cab
who
till
now
had
been
ostentatiously
unaware
that
there
was
any
sort
of
disturbance
among
the
lower
orders
suddenly
became
humanly
inquisitive
what
it
all
about
he
asked
swinging
around
and
addressing
george
head
exactly
what
i
want
to
know
said
george
he
indicated
the
merchant
the
gentleman
over
there
with
the
portable
seems
to
me
to
have
the
best
theory
the
stout
young
man
whose
peculiar
behaviour
had
drawn
all
this
flattering
attention
from
the
and
who
appeared
considerably
ruffled
by
the
publicity
had
been
puffing
noisily
during
the
foregoing
conversation
now
having
recovered
sufficient
breath
to
resume
the
attack
he
addressed
himself
to
george
once
more
damn
you
sir
will
you
let
me
look
inside
that
cab
leave
me
said
george
i
would
be
alone
there
is
a
young
lady
in
that
cab
i
saw
her
get
in
and
i
have
been
watching
ever
since
and
she
has
not
got
out
so
she
is
there
now
george
nodded
approval
of
this
close
reasoning
your
argument
seems
to
be
without
a
flaw
but
what
then
we
applaud
the
man
of
logic
but
what
of
the
man
of
action
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
get
out
of
my
way
i
wo
then
i
force
my
way
in
if
you
try
it
i
shall
infallibly
bust
you
one
on
the
jaw
the
stout
young
man
drew
back
a
pace
you
ca
do
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
i
know
i
ca
said
george
but
i
shall
in
this
life
my
dear
sir
we
must
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
we
must
distinguish
between
the
unusual
and
the
impossible
it
would
be
unusual
for
a
comparative
stranger
to
lean
out
of
a
cab
window
and
sock
you
one
but
you
appear
to
have
laid
your
plans
on
the
assumption
that
it
would
be
impossible
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
i
tell
you
what
it
is
the
advice
i
give
to
every
young
man
starting
life
is
confuse
the
unusual
with
the
impossible
take
the
present
case
for
instance
if
you
had
only
realized
the
possibility
of
somebody
some
day
busting
you
on
the
jaw
when
you
tried
to
get
into
a
cab
you
might
have
thought
out
dozens
of
crafty
schemes
for
dealing
with
the
matter
as
it
is
you
are
unprepared
the
thing
comes
on
you
as
a
surprise
the
whisper
flies
around
the
clubs
old
has
been
taken
unawares
he
can
not
cope
with
the
situation
the
man
with
the
made
another
diagnosis
he
was
seeing
clearer
and
clearer
into
the
thing
every
minute
looney
he
decided
this
one
bin
moppin
of
it
up
and
the
one
in
the
keb
orf
bloomin
onion
that
why
standin
up
instead
of
settin
wo
set
down
you
bring
a
bit
o
toast
he
thinks
a
poached
egg
george
beamed
upon
the
intelligent
fellow
your
reasoning
is
admirable
but
he
broke
off
here
not
because
he
had
not
more
to
say
but
for
the
reason
that
the
stout
young
man
now
in
quite
a
berserk
frame
of
mind
made
a
sudden
spring
at
the
cab
door
and
clutched
the
handle
which
he
was
about
to
wrench
when
george
acted
with
all
the
promptitude
and
decision
which
had
marked
his
behaviour
from
the
start
it
was
a
situation
which
called
for
the
nicest
judgment
to
allow
the
assailant
free
play
with
the
handle
or
even
to
wrestle
with
him
for
its
possession
entailed
the
risk
that
the
door
might
open
and
reveal
the
girl
to
bust
the
young
man
on
the
jaw
as
promised
on
the
other
hand
was
not
in
george
eyes
a
practical
policy
excellent
a
deterrent
as
the
threat
of
such
a
proceeding
might
be
its
actual
accomplishment
was
not
to
be
thought
of
gaols
yawn
and
actions
for
assault
lie
in
wait
for
those
who
go
about
the
place
busting
their
fellows
on
the
jaw
no
something
swift
something
decided
and
immediate
was
indicated
but
something
that
stopped
short
of
technical
battery
george
brought
his
hand
round
with
a
sweep
and
knocked
the
stout
young
man
silk
hat
off
the
effect
was
magical
we
all
of
us
have
our
achilles
heel
and
paradoxically
enough
in
the
case
of
the
stout
young
man
that
heel
was
his
hat
superbly
built
by
the
only
hatter
in
london
who
can
construct
a
silk
hat
that
is
a
silk
hat
and
freshly
ironed
by
loving
hands
but
a
brief
hour
before
at
the
only
in
london
where
ironing
is
ironing
and
not
a
brutal
attack
it
was
his
pride
and
joy
to
lose
it
was
like
losing
his
trousers
it
made
him
feel
insufficiently
clad
with
a
passionate
cry
like
that
of
some
wild
creature
deprived
of
its
young
the
erstwhile
berserk
released
the
handle
and
sprang
in
pursuit
at
the
same
moment
the
traffic
moved
on
again
the
last
george
saw
was
a
group
scene
with
the
stout
young
man
in
the
middle
of
it
the
hat
had
been
popped
up
into
the
infield
where
it
had
been
caught
by
the
messenger
boy
the
stout
young
man
was
bending
over
it
and
stroking
it
with
soothing
fingers
it
was
too
far
off
for
anything
to
be
audible
but
he
seemed
to
george
to
be
murmuring
words
of
endearment
to
it
then
placing
it
on
his
head
he
darted
out
into
the
road
and
george
saw
him
no
more
the
audience
remained
motionless
staring
at
the
spot
where
the
incident
had
happened
they
would
continue
to
do
this
till
the
next
policeman
came
along
and
moved
them
on
with
a
pleasant
wave
of
farewell
in
case
any
of
them
might
be
glancing
in
his
direction
george
drew
in
his
body
and
sat
down
the
girl
in
brown
had
risen
from
the
floor
if
she
had
ever
been
there
and
was
now
seated
composedly
at
the
further
end
of
the
cab
chapter
well
that
that
said
george
i
so
much
obliged
said
the
girl
it
was
a
pleasure
said
george
he
was
enabled
now
to
get
a
closer
more
leisurely
and
much
more
satisfactory
view
of
this
distressed
damsel
than
had
been
his
good
fortune
up
to
the
present
small
details
which
when
he
had
first
caught
sight
of
her
distance
had
hidden
from
his
view
now
presented
themselves
her
eyes
he
discovered
which
he
had
supposed
brown
were
only
brown
in
their
general
they
were
shot
with
attractive
little
flecks
of
gold
matching
perfectly
the
little
streaks
of
gold
which
the
sun
coming
out
again
on
one
of
his
flying
visits
and
now
shining
benignantly
once
more
on
the
world
revealed
in
her
hair
her
chin
was
square
and
determined
but
its
resoluteness
was
contradicted
by
a
dimple
and
by
the
pleasant
of
the
mouth
and
a
further
softening
of
the
face
was
effected
by
the
nose
which
seemed
to
have
started
out
with
the
intention
of
being
dignified
and
aristocratic
but
had
defeated
its
purpose
by
tilting
very
slightly
at
the
tip
this
was
a
girl
who
would
take
chances
but
would
take
them
with
a
smile
and
laugh
when
she
lost
george
was
but
an
amateur
physiognomist
but
he
could
read
what
was
obvious
in
the
faces
he
encountered
and
the
more
he
looked
at
this
girl
the
less
he
was
able
to
understand
the
scene
which
had
just
occurred
the
thing
mystified
him
completely
for
all
her
there
was
an
air
a
manner
a
something
capable
and
defensive
about
this
girl
with
which
he
could
not
imagine
any
man
venturing
to
take
liberties
the
eyes
as
they
met
his
now
were
friendly
and
smiling
but
he
could
imagine
them
freezing
into
a
stare
baleful
enough
and
haughty
enough
to
quell
such
a
person
as
the
young
man
with
a
single
glance
why
then
had
that
individual
been
able
to
demoralize
her
to
the
extent
of
flying
to
the
shelter
of
strange
cabs
she
was
composed
enough
now
it
was
true
but
it
had
been
quite
plain
that
at
the
moment
when
she
entered
the
taxi
her
nerve
had
momentarily
forsaken
her
there
were
mysteries
here
beyond
george
the
girl
looked
steadily
at
george
and
george
looked
steadily
at
her
for
the
space
of
perhaps
ten
seconds
she
seemed
to
george
to
be
summing
him
up
weighing
him
that
the
inspection
proved
satisfactory
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
at
the
end
of
this
period
she
smiled
then
she
laughed
a
clear
pealing
laugh
which
to
george
was
far
more
musical
than
the
most
popular
he
had
ever
written
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
what
it
all
about
she
said
this
was
precisely
what
george
was
wondering
most
consumedly
no
no
he
said
not
at
all
it
not
my
business
and
of
course
you
much
too
well
bred
to
be
inquisitive
about
other
people
business
of
course
i
am
what
was
it
all
about
i
afraid
i
ca
tell
you
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
the
cabman
i
do
know
what
do
men
usually
say
to
cabmen
i
mean
he
will
feel
very
hurt
if
i
do
give
him
a
full
explanation
of
all
this
he
stooped
from
his
pedestal
to
make
enquiries
just
now
condescension
like
that
deserves
some
recognition
give
him
a
nice
big
tip
george
was
reminded
of
his
reason
for
being
in
the
cab
i
ought
to
have
asked
before
he
said
where
can
i
drive
you
oh
i
must
steal
your
cab
where
were
you
going
i
was
going
back
to
my
hotel
i
came
out
without
any
money
so
i
shall
have
to
go
there
first
to
get
some
the
girl
started
what
the
matter
asked
george
i
lost
my
purse
good
lord
had
it
much
in
it
not
very
much
but
enough
to
buy
a
ticket
home
any
use
asking
where
that
is
none
i
afraid
i
was
going
to
of
course
of
course
not
that
what
i
admire
so
much
in
you
you
inquisitive
george
reflected
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
you
will
have
to
wait
in
the
cab
at
the
hotel
while
i
go
and
get
some
money
then
if
let
me
i
can
lend
you
what
you
require
it
much
too
kind
of
you
could
you
manage
eleven
shillings
easily
i
just
had
a
legacy
of
course
if
you
think
i
ought
to
be
economical
i
go
that
would
only
be
five
shillings
is
the
fare
so
you
see
the
place
i
want
to
get
to
is
two
hours
from
london
well
that
something
to
know
but
not
much
is
it
i
think
i
had
better
lend
you
a
sovereign
then
you
be
able
to
buy
a
you
think
of
everything
and
you
perfectly
right
i
shall
be
starving
but
how
do
you
know
you
will
get
the
money
back
i
risk
it
well
then
i
shall
have
to
be
inquisitive
and
ask
your
name
otherwise
i
sha
know
where
to
send
the
money
oh
there
no
mystery
about
me
i
an
open
book
you
need
be
horrid
about
it
i
ca
help
being
mysterious
i
did
mean
that
it
sounded
as
if
you
did
well
who
is
my
benefactor
my
name
is
george
bevan
i
am
staying
at
the
carlton
at
present
i
remember
the
taxi
moved
slowly
down
the
haymarket
the
girl
laughed
yes
said
george
i
was
only
thinking
of
back
there
you
know
i
have
thanked
you
nearly
enough
for
all
you
did
you
were
wonderful
i
very
glad
i
was
able
to
be
of
any
help
what
did
happen
you
must
remember
i
could
see
a
thing
except
your
back
and
i
could
only
hear
indistinctly
well
it
started
by
a
man
galloping
up
and
insisting
that
you
had
got
into
the
cab
he
was
a
fellow
with
the
appearance
of
a
advertisement
of
an
medicine
and
the
manners
of
a
chimpanzee
the
girl
nodded
then
it
was
percy
i
knew
i
was
mistaken
percy
that
is
his
name
it
would
be
i
could
have
betted
on
it
what
happened
then
i
reasoned
with
the
man
but
did
seem
to
soothe
him
and
finally
he
made
a
grab
for
the
so
i
knocked
off
his
hat
and
while
he
was
retrieving
it
we
moved
on
and
escaped
the
girl
gave
another
silver
peal
of
laughter
oh
what
a
shame
i
could
see
it
but
how
resourceful
of
you
how
did
you
happen
to
think
of
it
it
just
came
to
me
said
george
modestly
a
serious
look
came
into
the
girl
face
the
smile
died
out
of
her
eyes
she
shivered
when
i
think
how
some
men
might
have
behaved
in
your
place
oh
no
any
man
would
have
done
just
what
i
did
surely
knocking
off
percy
hat
was
an
act
of
simple
courtesy
which
anyone
would
have
performed
automatically
you
might
have
been
some
awful
bounder
or
what
would
have
been
almost
worse
a
idiot
who
would
have
stopped
to
ask
questions
before
doing
anything
to
think
i
should
have
had
the
luck
to
pick
you
out
of
all
london
i
been
looking
on
it
as
a
piece
of
luck
but
entirely
from
my
viewpoint
she
put
a
small
hand
on
his
arm
and
spoke
earnestly
bevan
you
must
think
that
because
i
been
laughing
a
good
deal
and
have
seemed
to
treat
all
this
as
a
joke
you
saved
me
from
real
trouble
if
you
had
been
there
and
acted
with
such
presence
of
mind
it
would
have
been
terrible
but
surely
if
that
fellow
was
annoying
you
you
could
have
called
a
policeman
oh
it
was
anything
like
that
it
was
much
much
worse
but
i
must
go
on
like
this
it
is
fair
on
you
her
eyes
lit
up
again
with
the
old
shining
smile
i
know
you
have
no
curiosity
about
me
but
still
there
no
knowing
whether
i
might
not
arouse
some
if
i
went
on
piling
up
the
mystery
and
the
silly
part
is
that
really
there
no
mystery
at
all
it
just
that
i
ca
tell
anyone
about
it
that
very
fact
seems
to
me
to
constitute
the
makings
of
a
pretty
fair
mystery
well
what
i
mean
is
i
not
a
princess
in
disguise
trying
to
escape
from
anarchists
or
anything
like
those
things
you
read
about
in
books
i
just
in
a
perfectly
simple
piece
of
trouble
you
would
be
bored
to
death
if
i
told
you
about
it
try
me
she
shook
her
head
no
besides
here
we
are
the
cab
had
stopped
at
the
hotel
and
a
commissionaire
was
already
opening
the
door
now
if
you
repented
of
your
rash
offer
and
really
are
going
to
be
so
awfully
kind
as
to
let
me
have
that
money
would
you
mind
rushing
off
and
getting
it
because
i
must
hurry
i
can
just
catch
a
good
train
and
it
hours
to
the
next
will
you
wait
here
i
be
back
in
a
moment
very
well
the
last
george
saw
of
her
was
another
of
those
exhilarating
smiles
of
hers
it
was
literally
the
last
he
saw
of
her
for
when
he
returned
not
more
than
two
minutes
later
the
cab
had
gone
the
girl
had
gone
and
the
world
was
empty
to
him
gaping
at
this
wholly
unforeseen
calamity
the
commissionaire
vouchsafed
information
the
young
lady
took
the
cab
on
sir
took
the
cab
on
almost
immediately
after
you
had
gone
sir
she
got
in
again
and
told
the
man
to
drive
to
waterloo
george
could
make
nothing
of
it
he
stood
there
in
silent
perplexity
and
might
have
continued
to
stand
indefinitely
had
not
his
mind
been
distracted
by
a
dictatorial
voice
at
his
elbow
you
sir
dammit
a
second
had
pulled
up
and
from
it
a
stout
faced
young
man
had
sprung
one
glance
told
george
all
the
hunt
was
up
once
more
the
bloodhound
had
picked
up
the
trail
percy
was
in
again
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
become
aware
of
her
flight
george
was
thankful
that
the
girl
had
disappeared
he
perceived
that
he
had
too
quickly
eliminated
percy
from
the
list
of
the
things
that
matter
engrossed
with
his
own
affairs
and
having
regarded
their
late
skirmish
as
a
decisive
battle
from
which
there
would
be
no
rallying
he
had
overlooked
the
possibility
of
this
annoying
and
unnecessary
person
following
them
in
another
cab
a
task
which
in
the
congested
traffic
must
have
been
a
perfectly
simple
one
well
here
he
was
his
soul
manifestly
all
stirred
up
and
his
at
a
far
higher
figure
than
his
doctor
would
have
approved
of
and
the
matter
would
have
to
be
opened
all
over
again
now
then
said
the
stout
young
man
george
regarded
him
with
a
critical
and
unfriendly
eye
he
disliked
this
fatty
degeneration
excessively
looking
him
up
and
down
he
could
find
no
point
about
him
that
gave
him
the
least
pleasure
with
the
single
exception
of
the
state
of
his
hat
in
the
side
of
which
he
was
rejoiced
to
perceive
there
was
a
large
and
unshapely
dent
you
thought
you
had
shaken
me
off
you
thought
you
given
me
the
slip
well
you
wrong
george
eyed
him
coldly
i
know
what
the
matter
with
you
he
said
someone
been
feeding
you
meat
the
young
man
bubbled
with
fury
his
face
turned
a
deeper
scarlet
he
gesticulated
you
blackguard
where
my
sister
at
this
extraordinary
remark
the
world
rocked
about
george
dizzily
the
words
upset
his
entire
diagnosis
of
the
situation
until
that
moment
he
had
looked
upon
this
man
as
a
lothario
a
pursuer
of
damsels
that
the
other
could
possibly
have
any
right
on
his
side
had
never
occurred
to
him
he
felt
unmanned
by
the
shock
it
seemed
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
your
sister
you
heard
what
i
said
where
is
she
george
was
still
endeavouring
to
adjust
his
scattered
faculties
he
felt
foolish
and
apologetic
he
had
imagined
himself
unassailably
in
the
right
and
it
now
appeared
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
for
a
moment
he
was
about
to
become
conciliatory
then
the
recollection
of
the
girl
panic
and
her
hints
at
some
trouble
which
threatened
her
presumably
through
the
medium
of
this
man
brother
or
no
brother
checked
him
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
all
about
but
the
one
thing
that
did
stand
out
clearly
in
the
welter
of
confused
happenings
was
the
girl
need
for
his
assistance
whatever
might
be
the
rights
of
the
case
he
was
her
accomplice
and
must
behave
as
such
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
said
the
young
man
shook
a
large
gloved
fist
in
his
face
you
blackguard
a
rich
deep
soft
soothing
voice
slid
into
the
heated
scene
like
the
holy
grail
sliding
athwart
a
sunbeam
what
all
this
a
vast
policeman
had
materialized
from
nowhere
he
stood
beside
them
a
living
statue
of
vigilant
authority
one
thumb
rested
easily
on
his
broad
belt
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
caressed
lightly
a
moustache
that
had
caused
more
among
the
gentler
sex
than
any
other
two
moustaches
in
the
the
eyes
above
the
moustache
were
stern
and
questioning
what
all
this
george
liked
policemen
he
knew
the
way
to
treat
them
his
voice
when
he
replied
had
precisely
the
correct
note
of
respectful
deference
which
the
force
likes
to
hear
i
really
could
say
officer
he
said
with
just
that
air
of
having
in
a
time
of
trouble
found
a
kind
elder
brother
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulties
which
made
the
constable
his
ally
on
the
spot
i
was
standing
here
when
this
man
suddenly
made
his
extraordinary
attack
on
me
i
wish
you
would
ask
him
to
go
away
the
policeman
tapped
the
stout
young
man
on
the
shoulder
this
wo
do
you
know
he
said
austerely
this
sort
o
thing
wo
do
you
know
take
your
hands
off
me
snorted
percy
a
frown
appeared
on
the
olympian
brow
jove
reached
for
his
thunderbolts
he
said
in
a
shocked
voice
as
of
a
god
defied
by
a
mortal
his
fingers
fell
on
percy
shoulder
again
but
this
time
not
in
a
mere
warning
tap
they
rested
where
they
fell
in
an
iron
clutch
it
wo
do
you
know
he
said
this
sort
o
thing
wo
do
madness
came
upon
the
stout
young
man
common
prudence
and
the
lessons
of
a
youth
fell
from
him
like
a
garment
with
an
incoherent
howl
he
wriggled
round
and
punched
the
policeman
smartly
in
the
stomach
ho
quoth
the
outraged
officer
suddenly
becoming
human
his
left
hand
removed
itself
from
the
belt
and
he
got
a
businesslike
grip
on
his
adversary
collar
will
you
come
along
with
me
it
was
amazing
the
thing
had
happened
in
such
an
incredibly
brief
space
of
time
one
moment
it
seemed
to
george
he
was
the
centre
of
a
nasty
row
in
one
of
the
most
public
spots
in
london
the
next
the
focus
had
shifted
he
had
ceased
to
matter
and
the
entire
attention
of
the
metropolis
was
focused
on
his
late
assailant
as
urged
by
the
arm
of
the
law
he
made
that
journey
to
vine
street
police
station
which
so
many
a
better
man
than
he
had
trod
george
watched
the
pair
as
they
moved
up
the
haymarket
followed
by
a
growing
and
increasingly
absorbed
crowd
then
he
turned
into
the
hotel
this
he
said
to
himself
is
the
middle
of
a
perfect
day
and
i
thought
london
dull
chapter
george
awoke
next
morning
with
a
misty
sense
that
somehow
the
world
had
changed
as
the
last
remnants
of
sleep
left
him
he
was
aware
of
a
vague
excitement
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
jerk
he
had
remembered
that
he
was
in
love
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
a
curious
happiness
pervaded
his
entire
being
he
felt
young
and
active
everything
was
emphatically
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
the
sun
was
shining
even
the
sound
of
someone
in
the
street
below
whistling
one
of
his
old
compositions
of
which
he
had
heartily
sickened
twelve
months
before
was
pleasant
to
his
ears
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
unseen
whistler
only
touched
the
key
in
odd
spots
and
had
a
poor
memory
for
tunes
george
sprang
lightly
out
of
bed
and
turned
on
the
cold
tap
in
the
while
he
lathered
his
face
for
its
morning
shave
he
beamed
at
himself
in
the
mirror
it
had
come
at
last
the
real
thing
george
had
never
been
in
love
before
not
really
in
love
true
from
the
age
of
fifteen
he
had
been
in
varying
degrees
of
intensity
attracted
sentimentally
by
the
opposite
sex
indeed
at
that
period
of
life
of
which
booth
tarkington
has
written
so
searchingly
the
age
of
seventeen
he
had
been
in
love
with
practically
every
female
he
met
and
with
dozens
whom
he
had
only
seen
in
the
distance
but
ripening
years
had
mellowed
his
taste
and
robbed
him
of
that
fine
romantic
catholicity
during
the
last
five
years
women
had
found
him
more
or
less
cold
it
was
the
nature
of
his
profession
that
had
largely
brought
about
this
cooling
of
the
emotions
to
a
man
who
like
george
has
worked
year
in
and
year
out
at
the
composition
of
musical
comedies
woman
comes
to
lose
many
of
those
attractive
qualities
which
ensnare
the
ordinary
male
to
george
of
late
years
it
had
begun
to
seem
that
the
salient
feature
of
woman
as
a
sex
was
her
disposition
to
kick
for
five
years
he
had
been
wandering
in
a
world
of
women
many
of
them
beautiful
all
of
them
superficially
attractive
who
had
left
no
other
impress
on
his
memory
except
the
vigour
and
frequency
with
which
they
had
kicked
some
had
kicked
about
their
musical
numbers
some
about
their
some
had
grumbled
about
their
exit
lines
others
about
the
lines
of
their
frocks
they
had
kicked
in
a
myriad
differing
ways
wrathfully
sweetly
noisily
softly
smilingly
tearfully
pathetically
and
patronizingly
but
they
had
all
kicked
with
the
result
that
woman
had
now
become
to
george
not
so
much
a
flaming
inspiration
or
a
tender
goddess
as
something
to
be
dodged
tactfully
if
possible
but
if
not
possible
by
open
flight
for
years
he
had
dreaded
to
be
left
alone
with
a
woman
and
had
developed
a
habit
of
gliding
swiftly
away
when
he
saw
one
bearing
down
on
him
the
psychological
effect
of
such
a
state
of
things
is
not
difficult
to
realize
take
a
man
of
naturally
quixotic
temperament
a
man
of
chivalrous
instincts
and
a
feeling
for
romance
and
cut
him
off
for
five
years
from
the
exercise
of
those
qualities
and
you
get
an
accumulated
store
of
foolishness
only
comparable
to
an
escape
of
gas
in
a
sealed
room
or
a
cellarful
of
dynamite
a
flicker
of
a
match
and
there
is
an
explosion
this
girl
tempestuous
irruption
into
his
life
had
supplied
flame
for
george
her
bright
eyes
looking
into
his
had
touched
off
the
spiritual
trinitrotoluol
which
he
had
been
storing
up
for
so
long
up
in
the
air
in
a
million
pieces
had
gone
the
prudence
and
of
a
lifetime
and
here
he
was
as
desperately
in
love
as
any
troubadour
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
not
till
he
had
finished
shaving
and
was
testing
the
temperature
of
his
bath
with
a
shrinking
toe
that
the
realization
came
over
him
in
a
wave
that
though
he
might
be
in
love
the
fairway
of
love
was
dotted
with
more
bunkers
than
any
golf
course
he
had
ever
played
on
in
his
life
in
the
first
place
he
did
not
know
the
girl
name
in
the
second
place
it
seemed
practically
impossible
that
he
would
ever
see
her
again
even
in
the
midst
of
his
optimism
george
could
not
deny
that
these
facts
might
reasonably
be
considered
in
the
nature
of
obstacles
he
went
back
into
his
bedroom
and
sat
on
the
bed
this
thing
wanted
thinking
over
he
was
not
depressed
only
a
little
thoughtful
his
faith
in
his
luck
sustained
him
he
was
he
realized
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
has
made
a
supreme
drive
from
the
tee
and
finds
his
ball
near
the
green
but
in
a
cuppy
lie
he
had
gained
much
it
now
remained
for
him
to
push
his
success
to
the
happy
conclusion
the
driver
of
luck
must
be
replaced
by
the
spoon
or
possibly
the
niblick
of
ingenuity
to
fail
now
to
allow
this
girl
to
pass
out
of
his
life
merely
because
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
or
where
she
was
would
stamp
him
a
feeble
adventurer
a
fellow
could
not
expect
luck
to
do
everything
for
him
he
must
supplement
its
assistance
with
his
own
efforts
what
had
he
to
go
on
well
nothing
much
if
it
came
to
that
except
the
knowledge
that
she
lived
some
two
hours
by
train
out
of
london
and
that
her
journey
started
from
waterloo
station
what
would
sherlock
holmes
have
done
concentrated
thought
supplied
no
answer
to
the
question
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
cheery
optimism
with
which
he
had
begun
the
day
left
george
and
gave
place
to
a
grey
gloom
a
dreadful
phrase
haunting
in
its
pathos
crept
into
his
mind
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
it
might
easily
turn
out
that
way
indeed
thinking
over
the
affair
in
all
its
aspects
as
he
dried
himself
after
his
tub
george
could
not
see
how
it
could
possibly
turn
out
any
other
way
he
dressed
moodily
and
left
the
room
to
go
down
to
breakfast
breakfast
would
at
least
alleviate
this
sinking
feeling
which
was
unmanning
him
and
he
could
think
more
briskly
after
a
cup
or
two
of
coffee
he
opened
the
door
on
a
mat
outside
lay
a
letter
the
handwriting
was
feminine
it
was
also
in
pencil
and
strange
to
him
he
opened
the
envelope
dear
bevan
it
began
with
a
sudden
leap
of
the
heart
he
looked
at
the
signature
the
letter
was
signed
the
girl
in
the
cab
dear
bevan
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
very
rude
running
off
without
waiting
to
say
i
had
to
i
saw
percy
driving
up
in
a
cab
and
knew
that
he
must
have
followed
us
he
did
not
see
me
so
i
got
away
all
right
i
managed
splendidly
about
the
money
for
i
remembered
that
i
was
wearing
a
nice
brooch
and
stopped
on
the
way
to
the
station
to
pawn
it
thank
you
ever
so
much
again
for
all
your
wonderful
kindness
yours
the
girl
in
the
cab
george
read
the
note
twice
on
the
way
down
to
the
breakfast
room
and
three
times
more
during
the
meal
then
having
committed
its
contents
to
memory
down
to
the
last
comma
he
gave
himself
up
to
glowing
thoughts
what
a
girl
he
had
never
in
his
life
before
met
a
woman
who
could
write
a
letter
without
a
postscript
and
this
was
but
the
smallest
of
her
unusual
gifts
the
resource
of
her
to
think
of
pawning
that
brooch
the
sweetness
of
her
to
bother
to
send
him
a
note
more
than
ever
before
was
he
convinced
that
he
had
met
his
ideal
and
more
than
ever
before
was
he
determined
that
a
triviality
like
being
unaware
of
her
name
and
address
should
not
keep
him
from
her
it
was
not
as
if
he
had
no
clue
to
go
upon
he
knew
that
she
lived
two
hours
from
london
and
started
home
from
waterloo
it
narrowed
the
thing
down
absurdly
there
were
only
about
three
counties
in
which
she
could
possibly
live
and
a
man
must
be
a
poor
fellow
who
is
incapable
of
searching
through
a
few
small
counties
for
the
girl
he
loves
especially
a
man
with
luck
like
his
luck
is
a
goddess
not
to
be
coerced
and
forcibly
wooed
by
those
who
seek
her
favours
from
such
masterful
spirits
she
turns
away
but
it
happens
sometimes
that
if
we
put
our
hand
in
hers
with
the
humble
trust
of
a
little
child
she
will
have
pity
on
us
and
not
fail
us
in
our
hour
of
need
on
george
hopefully
watching
for
something
to
turn
up
she
smiled
almost
immediately
it
was
george
practice
when
he
lunched
alone
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
the
meal
with
the
assistance
of
reading
matter
in
the
shape
of
one
or
more
of
the
evening
papers
today
sitting
down
to
a
solitary
repast
at
the
piccadilly
he
had
brought
with
him
an
early
edition
of
the
evening
news
and
one
of
the
first
items
which
met
his
eye
was
the
following
embodied
in
a
column
on
one
of
the
inner
pages
devoted
to
humorous
comments
in
prose
and
verse
on
the
happenings
of
the
day
this
particular
happening
the
writer
had
apparently
considered
worthy
of
being
dignified
by
rhyme
it
was

stirring
happenings

the
hour

said
and
no
one

was
two
or
thereabouts
the
day
was
fair
the
sky
was
blue
and
everything
was
peaceful
too
when
suddenly
a
gent
engaged
in
heated
argument
and
roundly
to
abuse
began
another
gentleman
his
fist
he
raised
on
high
to
dot
the
other
in
the
eye
who
knows
what
horrors
might
have
been
had
there
not
come
upon
the
scene

that
admirable

with
which
he
placed

here
for
flippant

the

the

made
our
ink

pale
let
us
be
brief
some
demon
sent

madness
on
the
gent
he
gave
the
constable
a
punch
just
where
the
latter
kept
his
lunch
the
constable
said
well
well
and
marched
him
to
a
dungeon

at
vine
street
station
out
it
came

this
was
no

rightly
indeed
had
he
relied
upon
his
luck
it
had
stood
by
him
nobly
with
this
clue
all
was
over
except
getting
to
the
nearest
free
library
and
consulting
burke
peerage
he
paid
his
bill
and
left
the
restaurant
ten
minutes
later
he
was
drinking
in
the
pregnant
information
that
belpher
was
the
family
name
of
the
earl
of
marshmoreton
and
that
the
present
earl
had
one
son

was

castle
belpher
hants
some
hours
later
seated
in
a
compartment
of
a
train
that
moved
slowly
out
of
waterloo
station
george
watched
london
vanish
behind
him
in
the
pocket
closest
to
his
throbbing
heart
was
a
single
ticket
to
belpher
chapter
at
about
the
time
that
george
bevan
train
was
leaving
waterloo
a
grey
racing
car
drew
up
with
a
grinding
of
brakes
and
a
sputter
of
gravel
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
of
belpher
castle
the
slim
and
elegant
young
man
at
the
wheel
removed
his
goggles
pulled
out
a
watch
and
addressed
the
stout
young
man
at
his
side
two
hours
and
eighteen
minutes
from
hyde
park
corner
boots
not
so
dusty
what
his
companion
made
no
reply
he
appeared
to
be
plunged
in
thought
he
too
removed
his
goggles
revealing
a
florid
and
gloomy
face
equipped
in
addition
to
the
usual
features
with
a
small
moustache
and
an
extra
chin
he
scowled
forbiddingly
at
the
charming
scene
which
the
goggles
had
hidden
from
him
before
him
a
symmetrical
mass
of
grey
stone
and
green
ivy
belpher
castle
towered
against
a
light
blue
sky
on
either
side
rolling
park
land
spread
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
carpeted
here
and
there
with
violets
dotted
with
great
oaks
and
ashes
and
spanish
chestnuts
orderly
peaceful
and
english
nearer
on
his
left
were
in
the
centre
of
which
tilted
at
a
sharp
angle
appeared
the
seat
of
a
pair
of
corduroy
trousers
whose
wearer
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
hunting
for
snails
thrushes
sang
in
the
green
shrubberies
rooks
cawed
in
the
elms
somewhere
in
the
distance
sounded
the
tinkle
of
sheep
bells
and
the
lowing
of
cows
it
was
in
fact
a
scene
which
lit
by
the
evening
sun
of
a
perfect
spring
day
and
fanned
by
a
gentle
westerly
wind
should
have
brought
balm
and
soothing
meditations
to
one
who
was
the
sole
heir
to
all
this
paradise
but
percy
lord
belpher
remained
uncomforted
by
the
notable
of
man
and
nature
and
drew
no
solace
from
the
reflection
that
all
these
pleasant
things
would
one
day
be
his
own
his
mind
was
occupied
at
the
moment
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
thoughts
by
the
recollection
of
that
painful
scene
in
bow
street
police
court
the
magistrate
remarks
which
had
been
tactless
and
unsympathetic
still
echoed
in
his
ears
and
that
infernal
night
in
vine
street
police
station
the
darkness
the
hard
bed
the
discordant
vocalising
of
the
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
next
cell
time
might
soften
these
memories
might
lessen
the
sharp
agony
of
them
but
nothing
could
remove
them
altogether
percy
had
been
shaken
to
the
core
of
his
being
physically
he
was
still
stiff
and
sore
from
the
plank
bed
mentally
he
was
a
volcano
he
had
been
marched
up
the
haymarket
in
the
full
sight
of
all
london
by
a
bounder
of
a
policeman
he
had
been
talked
to
like
an
erring
child
by
a
magistrate
whom
nothing
could
convince
that
he
had
not
been
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
the
man
had
said
things
about
his
liver
kindly
things
which
would
have
seemed
to
percy
indecently
frank
if
spoken
by
his
medical
adviser
in
the
privacy
of
the
sick
chamber
it
is
perhaps
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
belpher
castle
for
all
its
beauty
of
scenery
and
architecture
should
have
left
lord
belpher
a
little
cold
he
was
seething
with
a
fury
which
the
conversation
of
reggie
byng
had
done
nothing
to
allay
in
the
course
of
the
journey
from
london
reggie
was
the
last
person
he
would
willingly
have
chosen
as
a
companion
in
his
hour
of
darkness
reggie
was
not
soothing
he
would
insist
on
addressing
him
by
his
old
eton
nickname
of
boots
which
percy
detested
and
all
the
way
down
he
had
been
breaking
out
at
intervals
into
ribald
comments
on
the
recent
unfortunate
occurrence
which
were
very
hard
to
bear
he
resumed
this
vein
as
they
alighted
and
rang
the
bell
this
said
reggie
is
rather
like
a
bit
out
of
a
melodrama
convict
son
totters
up
the
steps
of
the
old
home
and
punches
the
bell
what
awaits
him
beyond
forgiveness
or
the
raspberry
true
the
butler
who
knew
him
as
a
child
will
sob
on
his
neck
but
what
of
the
old
dad
how
will
dad
take
the
blot
of
the
family
escutcheon
lord
belpher
scowl
deepened
it
not
a
joking
matter
he
said
coldly
great
heavens
i
not
joking
how
could
i
have
the
heart
to
joke
at
a
moment
like
this
when
the
friend
of
my
youth
has
suddenly
become
a
social
leper
i
wish
to
goodness
you
would
stop
do
you
think
it
is
any
pleasure
to
me
to
be
seen
about
with
a
man
who
is
now
known
in
criminal
circles
as
percy
the
piccadilly
i
keep
a
brave
face
before
the
world
but
inwardly
i
burn
with
shame
and
agony
and
what
not
the
great
door
of
the
castle
swung
open
revealing
keggs
the
butler
he
was
a
man
of
reverend
years
portly
and
dignified
with
a
respectfully
benevolent
face
that
beamed
gravely
on
the
young
master
and
byng
as
if
their
coming
had
filled
his
cup
of
pleasure
his
light
slightly
protruding
eyes
expressed
reverential
good
will
he
gave
just
that
touch
of
cosy
humanity
to
the
scene
which
the
hall
with
its
half
lights
and
massive
furniture
needed
to
make
it
perfect
to
the
returned
wanderer
he
seemed
to
be
intimating
that
this
was
a
moment
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
long
and
that
from
now
on
quiet
happiness
would
reign
supreme
it
is
distressing
to
have
to
reveal
the
jarring
fact
that
in
his
hours
of
privacy
when
off
duty
this
apparently
ideal
servitor
was
so
far
from
being
a
respecter
of
persons
that
he
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
lord
belpher
as
percy
and
even
as
his
nibs
it
was
indeed
an
open
secret
among
the
upper
servants
at
the
castle
and
a
fact
hinted
at
with
awe
among
the
lower
that
keggs
was
at
heart
a
socialist
good
evening
your
lordship
good
evening
sir
lord
belpher
acknowledged
the
salutation
with
a
grunt
but
reggie
was
more
affable
how
are
you
keggs
now
your
time
if
you
going
to
do
it
he
stepped
a
little
to
one
side
and
indicated
lord
belpher
crimson
neck
with
an
inviting
gesture
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
ah
you
rather
wait
till
you
can
do
it
a
little
more
privately
perhaps
you
right
the
butler
smiled
indulgently
he
did
not
understand
what
reggie
was
talking
about
but
that
did
not
worry
him
he
had
long
since
come
to
the
conclusion
that
reggie
was
slightly
mad
a
theory
supported
by
the
latter
valet
who
was
of
the
same
opinion
keggs
did
not
dislike
reggie
but
intellectually
he
considered
him
negligible
send
something
to
drink
into
the
library
keggs
said
lord
belpher
very
good
your
lordship
a
topping
idea
said
reggie
i
just
take
the
old
car
round
to
the
garage
and
then
i
be
with
you
he
climbed
to
the
steering
wheel
and
started
the
engine
lord
belpher
proceeded
to
the
library
while
keggs
melted
away
through
the
green
baize
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
which
divided
the
servants
quarters
from
the
rest
of
the
house
reggie
had
hardly
driven
a
dozen
yards
when
he
perceived
his
stepmother
and
lord
marshmoreton
coming
towards
him
from
the
direction
of
the
he
drew
up
to
greet
them
hullo
mater
what
ho
uncle
back
again
at
the
old
homestead
what
beneath
lady
caroline
aristocratic
front
agitation
seemed
to
lurk
reggie
where
is
percy
old
boots
i
think
he
gone
to
the
library
i
just
decanted
him
out
of
the
car
lady
caroline
turned
to
her
brother
let
us
go
to
the
library
john
all
right
all
right
all
right
said
lord
marshmoreton
irritably
something
appeared
to
have
ruffled
his
calm
reggie
drove
on
as
he
was
strolling
back
after
putting
the
car
away
he
met
maud
hullo
maud
dear
old
thing
why
hullo
reggie
i
was
expecting
you
back
last
night
could
get
back
last
night
had
to
stick
in
town
and
rally
round
old
boots
could
desert
the
old
boy
in
his
hour
of
trial
reggie
chuckled
amusedly
of
trial
is
rather
good
what
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
just
what
it
was
do
you
know
why
what
happened
to
percy
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
of
course
not
it
have
been
in
the
morning
papers
why
percy
punched
a
policeman
percy
did
what
slugged
a
slop
most
dramatic
thing
sloshed
him
in
the
midriff
absolutely
the
cross
marks
the
spot
where
the
tragedy
occurred
maud
caught
her
breath
somehow
though
she
could
not
trace
the
connection
she
felt
that
this
extraordinary
happening
must
be
linked
up
with
her
escapade
then
her
sense
of
humour
got
the
better
of
apprehension
her
eyes
twinkled
delightedly
you
do
mean
to
say
percy
did
that
absolutely
the
human
tiger
and
what
not
menace
to
society
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
no
holding
him
for
some
unexplained
reason
the
generous
blood
of
the
belphers
boiled
over
and
then
zing
they
jerked
him
off
to
vine
street
like
the
poem
do
you
know
poor
old
percy
walked
between
with
gyves
upon
his
wrists
and
this
morning
bright
and
early
the
beak
parted
him
from
ten
quid
you
know
maud
old
thing
our
duty
stares
us
plainly
in
the
eyeball
we
got
to
train
old
boots
down
to
a
reasonable
weight
and
spring
him
on
the
national
sporting
club
we
been
letting
a
champion
middleweight
blush
unseen
under
our
very
roof
tree
maud
hesitated
a
moment
i
suppose
you
do
know
she
asked
carelessly
why
he
did
it
i
mean
did
he
tell
you
anything
could
get
a
word
out
of
him
oysters
garrulous
and
tombs
chatty
in
comparison
absolutely
all
i
know
is
that
he
popped
one
into
the
officer
waistband
what
led
up
to
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
how
would
it
be
to
stagger
to
the
library
and
join
the
the
well
i
met
the
mater
and
his
lordship
on
their
way
to
the
library
and
it
looked
to
me
very
much
as
if
the
mater
must
have
got
hold
of
an
evening
paper
on
her
journey
from
town
when
did
she
arrive
only
a
short
while
ago
then
that
what
happened
she
would
have
bought
an
evening
paper
to
read
in
the
train
by
jove
i
wonder
if
she
got
hold
of
the
one
that
had
the
poem
about
it
one
chappie
was
so
carried
away
by
the
beauty
of
the
episode
that
he
treated
it
in
verse
i
think
we
ought
to
look
in
and
see
what
happening
maud
hesitated
again
but
she
was
a
girl
of
spirit
and
she
had
an
intuition
that
her
best
defence
would
be
attack
bluff
was
what
was
needed
innocent
wonder
after
all
percy
be
certain
he
had
seen
her
in
piccadilly
all
right
by
the
way
dear
old
girl
inquired
reggie
did
your
little
business
come
out
satisfactorily
i
forgot
to
ask
not
very
but
it
was
awfully
sweet
of
you
to
take
me
into
town
how
would
it
be
said
reggie
nervously
not
to
dwell
too
much
on
that
part
of
it
what
i
mean
to
say
is
for
heaven
sake
do
let
the
mater
know
i
rallied
round
do
worry
said
maud
with
a
laugh
i
not
going
to
talk
about
the
thing
at
all
lord
belpher
meanwhile
in
the
library
had
begun
with
the
aid
of
a
whisky
and
soda
to
feel
a
little
better
there
was
something
about
the
library
with
its
sombre
half
tones
that
soothed
his
bruised
spirit
the
room
held
something
of
the
peace
of
a
deserted
city
the
world
with
its
violent
adventures
and
tall
policemen
did
not
enter
here
there
was
balm
in
those
rows
and
rows
of
books
which
nobody
ever
read
those
vast
writing
tables
at
which
nobody
ever
wrote
from
the
broad
the
bust
of
some
unnamed
ancient
looked
down
almost
sympathetically
something
remotely
resembling
peace
had
begun
to
steal
into
percy
soul
when
it
was
expelled
by
the
abrupt
opening
of
the
door
and
the
entry
of
lady
caroline
byng
and
his
father
one
glance
at
the
face
of
the
former
was
enough
to
tell
lord
belpher
that
she
knew
all
he
rose
defensively
let
me
explain
lady
caroline
quivered
with
repressed
emotion
this
masterly
woman
had
not
lost
control
of
herself
but
her
aristocratic
calm
had
seldom
been
so
severely
tested
as
reggie
had
surmised
she
had
read
the
report
of
the
proceedings
in
the
evening
paper
in
the
train
and
her
world
had
been
reeling
ever
since
caesar
stabbed
by
brutus
could
scarcely
have
experienced
a
greater
shock
the
other
members
of
her
family
had
disappointed
her
often
she
had
become
inured
to
the
spectacle
of
her
brother
working
in
the
garden
in
corduroy
trousers
and
in
other
ways
behaving
in
a
manner
beneath
the
dignity
of
an
earl
of
marshmoreton
she
had
resigned
herself
to
the
innate
flaw
in
the
character
of
maud
which
had
allowed
her
to
fall
in
love
with
a
nobody
whom
she
had
met
without
an
introduction
even
reggie
had
exhibited
at
times
democratic
traits
of
which
she
thoroughly
disapproved
but
of
her
nephew
percy
she
had
always
been
sure
he
was
solid
rock
he
at
least
she
had
always
felt
would
never
do
anything
to
injure
the
family
prestige
and
now
so
to
speak
lo
ben
adhem
name
led
all
the
rest
in
other
words
percy
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
whatever
indiscretions
the
rest
had
committed
at
least
they
had
never
got
the
family
into
the
comic
columns
of
the
evening
papers
lord
marshmoreton
might
wear
corduroy
trousers
and
refuse
to
entertain
the
county
at
garden
parties
and
go
to
bed
with
a
book
when
it
was
his
duty
to
act
as
host
at
a
formal
ball
maud
might
give
her
heart
to
an
impossible
person
whom
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
and
reggie
might
be
seen
at
fashionable
restaurants
with
pugilists
but
at
any
rate
evening
paper
poets
had
never
written
facetious
verses
about
their
exploits
this
crowning
degradation
had
been
reserved
for
the
hitherto
blameless
percy
who
of
all
the
young
men
of
lady
caroline
acquaintance
had
till
now
appeared
to
have
the
most
scrupulous
sense
of
his
position
the
most
rigid
regard
for
the
dignity
of
his
great
name
yet
here
he
was
if
the
carefully
considered
reports
in
the
daily
press
were
to
be
believed
spending
his
time
in
the
very
of
his
life
running
about
london
like
a
frenzied
hottentot
brutally
assaulting
the
police
lady
caroline
felt
as
a
bishop
might
feel
if
he
suddenly
discovered
that
some
favourite
curate
had
gone
over
to
the
worship
of
mumbo
jumbo
explain
she
cried
how
can
you
explain
you
my
nephew
the
heir
to
the
title
behaving
like
a
common
rowdy
in
the
streets
of
london
your
name
in
the
papers
if
you
knew
the
circumstances
the
circumstances
they
are
in
the
evening
paper
they
are
in
print
in
verse
added
lord
marshmoreton
he
chuckled
amiably
at
the
recollection
he
was
an
easily
amused
man
you
ought
to
read
it
my
boy
some
of
it
was
capital
john
but
deplorable
of
course
added
lord
marshmoreton
hastily
very
deplorable
he
endeavoured
to
regain
his
sister
esteem
by
a
show
of
righteous
indignation
what
do
you
mean
by
it
damn
it
my
only
son
i
have
watched
you
grow
from
child
to
boy
from
boy
to
man
with
tender
solicitude
i
have
wanted
to
be
proud
of
you
and
all
the
time
dash
it
you
are
prowling
about
london
like
a
lion
seeking
whom
you
may
devour
terrorising
the
metropolis
putting
harmless
policemen
in
fear
of
their
lives
will
you
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
shouted
percy
he
began
to
speak
rapidly
as
one
conscious
of
the
necessity
of
saying
his
say
while
the
saying
was
good
the
facts
are
these
i
was
walking
along
piccadilly
on
my
way
to
lunch
at
the
club
when
near
burlington
arcade
i
was
amazed
to
see
maud
lady
caroline
uttered
an
exclamation
maud
but
maud
was
here
i
ca
understand
it
went
on
lord
marshmoreton
pursuing
his
remarks
righteous
indignation
had
he
felt
gone
well
it
might
be
judicious
to
continue
in
that
vein
though
privately
he
held
the
opinion
that
nothing
in
percy
life
so
became
him
as
this
assault
on
the
force
lord
marshmoreton
who
in
his
time
had
committed
all
the
follies
of
youth
had
come
to
look
on
his
blameless
son
as
scarcely
human
it
not
as
if
you
were
wild
you
never
got
into
any
scrapes
at
oxford
you
spent
your
time
collecting
old
china
and
prayer
rugs
you
wear
flannel
next
your
skin
will
you
please
be
quiet
said
lady
caroline
impatiently
go
on
percy
oh
very
well
said
lord
marshmoreton
i
only
spoke
i
merely
made
a
remark
you
say
you
saw
maud
in
piccadilly
percy
precisely
i
was
on
the
point
of
putting
it
down
to
an
extraordinary
resemblance
when
suddenly
she
got
into
a
cab
then
i
knew
lord
marshmoreton
could
not
permit
this
to
pass
in
silence
he
was
a
man
why
should
the
girl
have
got
into
a
cab
why
must
a
girl
walking
along
piccadilly
be
my
daughter
maud
just
because
she
got
into
a
cab
london
he
proceeded
warming
to
the
argument
and
thrilled
by
the
clearness
and
coherence
of
his
reasoning
is
full
of
girls
who
take
cabs
she
did
take
a
cab
you
just
said
she
did
said
lord
marshmoreton
cleverly
i
said
she
got
into
a
cab
there
was
somebody
else
already
in
the
cab
a
man
aunt
caroline
it
was
the
man
good
gracious
ejaculated
lady
caroline
falling
into
a
chair
as
if
she
had
been
hamstrung
i
am
absolutely
convinced
of
it
proceeded
lord
belpher
solemnly
his
behaviour
was
enough
to
confirm
my
suspicions
the
cab
had
stopped
in
a
block
of
the
traffic
and
i
went
up
and
requested
him
in
a
perfectly
civil
manner
to
allow
me
to
look
at
the
lady
who
had
just
got
in
he
denied
that
there
was
a
lady
in
the
cab
and
i
had
seen
her
jump
in
with
my
own
eyes
throughout
the
conversation
he
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
with
the
obvious
intention
of
screening
whoever
was
inside
from
my
view
i
followed
him
along
piccadilly
in
another
cab
and
tracked
him
to
the
carlton
when
i
arrived
there
he
was
standing
on
the
pavement
outside
there
were
no
signs
of
maud
i
demanded
that
he
tell
me
her
whereabouts
that
reminds
me
said
lord
marshmoreton
cheerfully
of
a
story
i
read
in
one
of
the
papers
i
daresay
it
old
stop
me
if
heard
it
a
woman
says
to
the
maid
you
know
anything
of
my
husband
whereabouts
and
the
maid
replies
do
be
quiet
snapped
lady
caroline
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
be
interested
in
a
matter
affecting
the
vital
welfare
of
your
only
daughter
i
am
i
am
said
lord
marshmoreton
hastily
the
maid
replied
at
the
of
course
i
am
go
on
percy
good
god
boy
do
take
all
day
telling
us
your
story
at
that
moment
the
fool
of
a
policeman
came
up
and
wanted
to
know
what
the
matter
was
i
lost
my
head
i
admit
it
freely
the
policeman
grasped
my
shoulder
and
i
struck
him
where
asked
lord
marshmoreton
a
stickler
for
detail
what
does
that
matter
demanded
lady
caroline
you
did
quite
right
percy
these
insolent
jacks
in
office
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
manhandle
people
tell
me
what
this
man
was
like
extremely
in
fact
all
i
can
remember
about
him
was
that
he
was
i
can
not
understand
how
maud
could
have
come
to
lose
her
head
over
such
a
man
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
no
attraction
whatever
said
lord
belpher
a
little
unreasonably
for
apollo
himself
would
hardly
appear
attractive
when
knocking
one
best
hat
off
it
must
have
been
the
same
man
precisely
if
we
wanted
further
proof
he
was
an
american
you
recollect
that
we
heard
that
the
man
in
wales
was
american
there
was
a
portentous
silence
percy
stared
at
the
floor
lady
caroline
breathed
deeply
lord
marshmoreton
feeling
that
something
was
expected
of
him
said
good
gad
and
gazed
seriously
at
a
stuffed
owl
on
a
bracket
maud
and
reggie
byng
came
in
what
ho
what
ho
what
ho
said
reggie
breezily
he
always
believed
in
starting
a
conversation
well
and
putting
people
at
their
ease
what
ho
what
ho
maud
braced
herself
for
the
encounter
hullo
percy
dear
she
said
meeting
her
brother
accusing
eye
with
the
perfect
composure
that
comes
only
from
a
thoroughly
guilty
conscience
what
all
this
i
hear
about
your
being
the
scourge
of
london
reggie
says
that
policemen
dive
down
manholes
when
they
see
you
coming
the
chill
in
the
air
would
have
daunted
a
less
courageous
girl
lady
caroline
had
risen
and
was
staring
sternly
percy
was
puffing
the
puffs
of
an
overwrought
soul
lord
marshmoreton
whose
thoughts
had
wandered
off
to
the
rose
garden
pulled
himself
together
and
tried
to
look
menacing
maud
went
on
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
was
all
bubbling
gaiety
and
insouciance
a
charming
picture
of
young
english
girlhood
that
nearly
made
her
brother
foam
at
the
mouth
father
dear
she
said
attaching
herself
affectionately
to
his
buttonhole
i
went
round
the
links
in
this
morning
i
did
the
long
hole
in
four
one
under
par
a
thing
i
never
done
before
in
my
life
bless
my
soul
said
lord
marshmoreton
weakly
as
with
an
apprehensive
eye
on
his
sister
he
patted
his
daughter
shoulder
first
i
sent
a
screecher
of
a
drive
right
down
the
middle
of
the
fairway
then
i
took
my
brassey
and
put
the
ball
just
on
the
edge
of
the
green
a
hundred
and
eighty
yards
if
it
was
an
inch
my
approach
putt
lady
caroline
who
was
no
devotee
of
the
royal
and
ancient
game
interrupted
the
recital
never
mind
what
you
did
this
morning
what
did
you
do
yesterday
afternoon
yes
said
lord
belpher
where
were
you
yesterday
afternoon
maud
gaze
was
the
gaze
of
a
young
child
who
has
never
even
attempted
to
put
anything
over
in
all
its
little
life
whatever
do
you
mean
what
were
you
doing
in
piccadilly
yesterday
afternoon
said
lady
caroline
piccadilly
the
place
where
percy
fights
policemen
i
understand
lady
caroline
was
no
sportsman
she
put
one
of
those
direct
questions
capable
of
being
answered
only
by
yes
or
no
which
ought
not
to
be
allowed
in
controversy
they
are
the
verbal
equivalent
of
shooting
a
sitting
bird
did
you
or
did
you
not
go
to
london
yesterday
maud
the
monstrous
unfairness
of
this
method
of
attack
pained
maud
from
childhood
up
she
had
held
the
customary
feminine
views
upon
the
lie
direct
as
long
as
it
was
a
question
of
suppression
of
the
true
or
suggestion
of
the
false
she
had
no
scruples
but
she
had
a
distaste
for
deliberate
falsehood
faced
now
with
a
choice
between
two
evils
she
chose
the
one
which
would
at
least
leave
her
yes
i
did
lady
caroline
looked
at
lord
belpher
lord
belpher
looked
at
lady
caroline
you
went
to
meet
that
american
of
yours
reggie
byng
slid
softly
from
the
room
he
felt
that
he
would
be
happier
elsewhere
he
had
been
an
acutely
embarrassed
spectator
of
this
distressing
scene
and
had
been
passing
the
time
by
shuffling
his
feet
playing
with
his
coat
buttons
and
perspiring
do
go
reggie
said
lord
belpher
well
what
i
mean
to
say
is
family
row
and
what
not
if
you
see
what
i
mean
i
one
or
two
things
i
ought
to
do
he
vanished
lord
belpher
frowned
a
sombre
frown
then
it
was
that
man
who
knocked
my
hat
off
what
do
you
mean
said
lady
caroline
knocked
your
hat
off
you
never
told
me
he
knocked
your
hat
off
it
was
when
i
was
asking
him
to
let
me
look
inside
the
cab
i
had
grasped
the
handle
of
the
door
when
he
suddenly
struck
my
hat
causing
it
to
fly
off
and
while
i
was
picking
it
up
he
drove
away
exploded
lord
marshmoreton
he
twisted
his
face
by
a
supreme
exertion
of
will
power
into
a
mask
of
indignation
you
ought
to
have
had
the
scoundrel
arrested
he
said
vehemently
it
was
a
technical
assault
the
man
who
knocked
your
hat
off
percy
said
maud
was
not
he
was
a
different
man
altogether
a
stranger
as
if
you
would
be
in
a
cab
with
a
stranger
said
lady
caroline
caustically
there
are
limits
i
hope
to
even
your
indiscretions
lord
marshmoreton
cleared
his
throat
he
was
sorry
for
maud
whom
he
loved
now
looking
at
the
matter
broadly
be
quiet
said
lady
caroline
lord
marshmoreton
subsided
i
wanted
to
avoid
you
said
maud
so
i
jumped
into
the
first
cab
i
saw
i
do
believe
it
said
percy
it
the
truth
you
are
simply
trying
to
put
us
off
the
scent
lady
caroline
turned
to
maud
her
manner
was
plaintive
she
looked
like
a
martyr
at
the
stake
who
deprecatingly
lodges
a
timid
complaint
fearful
the
while
lest
she
may
be
hurting
the
feelings
of
her
persecutors
by
appearing
even
for
a
moment
out
of
sympathy
with
their
activities
my
dear
child
why
will
you
not
be
reasonable
in
this
matter
why
will
you
not
let
yourself
be
guided
by
those
who
are
older
and
wiser
than
you
exactly
said
lord
belpher
the
whole
thing
is
too
absurd
precisely
said
lord
belpher
lady
caroline
turned
on
him
irritably
please
do
not
interrupt
percy
now
you
made
me
forget
what
i
was
going
to
say
to
my
mind
said
lord
marshmoreton
coming
to
the
surface
once
more
the
proper
attitude
to
adopt
on
occasions
like
the
present
please
said
lady
caroline
lord
marshmoreton
stopped
and
resumed
his
silent
communion
with
the
stuffed
bird
you
ca
stop
yourself
being
in
love
aunt
caroline
said
maud
you
can
be
stopped
if
you
somebody
with
a
level
head
looking
after
you
lord
marshmoreton
tore
himself
away
from
the
bird
why
when
i
was
at
oxford
in
the
year
he
said
chattily
i
fancied
myself
in
love
with
the
female
assistant
at
a
tobacconist
shop
desperately
in
love
dammit
wanted
to
marry
her
i
recollect
my
poor
father
took
me
away
from
oxford
and
kept
me
here
at
belpher
under
lock
and
key
lock
and
key
dammit
i
was
deucedly
upset
at
the
time
i
remember
his
mind
wandered
off
into
the
glorious
past
i
wonder
what
that
girl
name
was
odd
one
ca
remember
names
she
had
chestnut
hair
and
a
mole
on
the
side
of
her
chin
i
used
to
kiss
it
i
recollect
lady
caroline
usually
such
an
advocate
of
her
brother
researches
into
the
family
history
cut
the
reminiscences
short
never
mind
that
now
i
do
i
got
over
it
that
the
moral
well
said
lady
caroline
at
any
rate
poor
father
acted
with
great
good
sense
on
that
occasion
there
seems
nothing
to
do
but
to
treat
maud
in
just
the
same
way
you
shall
not
stir
a
step
from
the
castle
till
you
have
got
over
this
dreadful
infatuation
you
will
be
watched
i
shall
watch
you
said
lord
belpher
solemnly
i
shall
watch
your
every
movement
a
dreamy
look
came
into
maud
brown
eyes
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
she
said
softly
that
was
your
experience
percy
my
boy
said
lord
marshmoreton
they
make
a
very
good
imitation
said
lady
caroline
coldly
ignoring
the
interruption
maud
faced
her
defiantly
she
looked
like
a
princess
in
captivity
facing
her
gaolers
i
do
care
i
love
him
and
i
always
shall
love
him
and
nothing
is
ever
going
to
stop
me
loving
him
because
i
love
him
she
concluded
a
little
lamely
nonsense
said
lady
caroline
in
a
year
from
now
you
will
have
forgotten
his
name
do
you
agree
with
me
percy
quite
said
lord
belpher
i
sha
deuced
hard
things
to
remember
names
said
lord
marshmoreton
if
i
tried
once
to
remember
that
tobacconist
girl
name
tried
a
hundred
times
i
have
an
idea
it
began
with
an
muriel
or
hilda
or
something
within
a
year
said
lady
caroline
you
will
be
wondering
how
you
ever
came
to
be
so
foolish
do
you
think
so
percy
quite
said
lord
belpher
lord
marshmoreton
turned
on
him
irritably
good
god
boy
ca
you
answer
a
simple
question
with
a
plain
affirmative
what
do
you
mean
quite
if
somebody
came
to
me
and
pointed
you
out
and
said
that
your
son
do
you
suppose
i
should
say
i
wish
the
devil
you
did
collect
prayer
rugs
it
sapped
your
brain
they
say
prison
life
often
weakens
the
intellect
father
said
maud
she
moved
towards
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
albert
the
page
boy
who
had
been
courting
earache
by
listening
at
the
keyhole
straightened
his
small
body
and
scuttled
away
well
is
that
all
aunt
caroline
may
i
go
now
certainly
i
have
said
all
i
wished
to
say
very
well
i
sorry
to
disobey
you
but
i
ca
help
it
you
find
you
can
help
it
after
you
been
cooped
up
here
for
a
few
more
months
said
percy
a
gentle
smile
played
over
maud
face
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
she
murmured
softly
and
passed
from
the
room
what
did
she
say
asked
lord
marshmoreton
interested
something
about
somebody
laughing
at
a
locksmith
i
understand
why
should
anyone
laugh
at
locksmiths
most
respectable
men
had
one
up
here
only
the
day
before
yesterday
forcing
open
the
drawer
of
my
desk
watched
him
do
it
most
interesting
he
smelt
rather
strongly
of
a
damned
bad
brand
of
tobacco
fellow
must
have
a
throat
of
leather
to
be
able
to
smoke
the
stuff
but
he
did
strike
me
as
an
object
of
derision
from
first
to
last
i
was
never
tempted
to
laugh
once
lord
belpher
wandered
moodily
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
gathering
darkness
and
this
has
to
happen
he
said
bitterly
on
the
eve
of
my
birthday
chapter
the
first
requisite
of
an
invading
army
is
a
base
george
having
entered
belpher
village
and
thus
accomplished
the
first
stage
in
his
foreward
movement
on
the
castle
selected
as
his
base
the
marshmoreton
arms
selected
is
perhaps
hardly
the
right
word
as
it
implies
choice
and
in
george
case
there
was
no
choice
there
are
two
inns
at
belpher
but
the
marshmoreton
arms
is
the
only
one
that
offers
accommodation
for
man
and
beast
assuming
that
is
to
say
that
the
man
and
beast
desire
to
spend
the
night
the
other
house
the
blue
boar
is
a
mere
beerhouse
where
the
lower
strata
of
belpher
society
gather
of
a
night
to
quench
their
thirst
and
to
tell
one
another
interminable
stories
without
any
point
whatsoever
but
the
marshmoreton
arms
is
a
comfortable
respectable
hostelry
catering
for
the
village
plutocrats
there
of
an
evening
you
will
find
the
local
veterinary
surgeon
smoking
a
pipe
with
the
grocer
the
baker
and
the
butcher
with
perhaps
a
sprinkling
of
neighbouring
farmers
to
help
the
conversation
along
on
saturdays
there
is
a
shilling
ordinary
which
is
rural
english
for
a
cut
off
the
joint
and
a
boiled
potato
followed
by
hunks
of
the
sort
of
cheese
which
believes
that
it
pays
to
advertise
and
this
is
usually
well
attended
on
the
other
days
of
the
week
until
late
in
the
evening
however
the
visitor
to
the
marshmoreton
arms
has
the
place
almost
entirely
to
himself
it
is
to
be
questioned
whether
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
world
there
is
a
more
admirable
spot
for
a
man
in
love
to
pass
a
day
or
two
than
the
typical
english
village
the
rocky
mountains
that
traditional
for
the
heartbroken
may
be
well
enough
in
their
way
but
a
lover
has
to
be
cast
in
a
pretty
stern
mould
to
be
able
to
be
introspective
when
at
any
moment
he
may
meet
an
annoyed
cinnamon
bear
in
the
english
village
there
are
no
such
obstacles
to
meditation
it
combines
the
comforts
of
civilization
with
the
restfulness
of
solitude
in
a
manner
equalled
by
no
other
spot
except
the
new
york
public
library
here
your
lover
may
wander
to
and
fro
unmolested
speaking
to
nobody
by
nobody
addressed
and
have
the
satisfaction
at
the
end
of
the
day
of
sitting
down
to
a
capitally
cooked
chop
and
chips
lubricated
by
golden
english
ale
belpher
in
addition
to
all
the
advantages
of
the
usual
village
has
a
quiet
charm
all
its
own
due
to
the
fact
that
it
has
seen
better
days
in
a
sense
it
is
a
ruin
and
ruins
are
always
soothing
to
the
bruised
soul
ten
years
before
belpher
had
been
a
flourishing
centre
of
the
south
of
england
oyster
trade
it
is
situated
by
the
shore
where
hayling
island
lying
athwart
the
mouth
of
the
bay
forms
the
waters
into
a
sort
of
brackish
lagoon
in
much
the
same
way
as
fire
island
shuts
off
the
great
south
bay
of
long
island
from
the
waves
of
the
atlantic
the
water
of
belpher
creek
is
shallow
even
at
high
tide
and
when
the
tide
runs
out
it
leaves
glistening
mud
flats
which
it
is
the
peculiar
taste
of
the
oyster
to
prefer
to
any
other
habitation
for
years
belpher
oysters
had
been
the
mainstay
of
gay
supper
parties
at
the
savoy
the
carlton
and
romano
dukes
doted
on
them
chorus
girls
wept
if
they
were
not
on
the
bill
of
fare
and
then
in
an
evil
hour
somebody
discovered
that
what
made
the
belpher
oyster
so
particularly
plump
and
succulent
was
the
fact
that
it
breakfasted
lunched
and
dined
almost
entirely
on
the
local
sewage
there
is
but
a
thin
line
ever
between
popular
homage
and
execration
we
see
it
in
the
case
of
politicians
generals
and
and
oysters
are
no
exception
to
the
rule
there
was
a
typhoid
scare
quite
a
passing
and
unjustified
scare
but
strong
enough
to
do
its
deadly
work
and
almost
overnight
belpher
passed
from
a
place
of
flourishing
industry
to
the
sleepy
spot
which
it
was
when
george
bevan
discovered
it
the
shallow
water
is
still
there
the
mud
is
still
there
even
the
are
still
there
but
not
the
oysters
nor
the
little
world
of
activity
which
had
sprung
up
around
them
the
glory
of
belpher
is
dead
and
over
its
gates
ichabod
is
written
but
if
it
has
lost
in
importance
it
has
gained
in
charm
and
george
for
one
had
no
regrets
to
him
in
his
present
state
of
mental
upheaval
belpher
was
the
ideal
spot
it
was
not
at
first
that
george
roused
himself
to
the
point
of
asking
why
he
was
here
and
what
now
that
he
was
here
he
proposed
to
do
for
two
languorous
days
he
loafed
sufficiently
occupied
with
his
thoughts
he
smoked
long
peaceful
pipes
in
the
watching
the
ostlers
as
they
groomed
the
horses
he
played
with
the
inn
puppy
bestowed
respectful
caresses
on
the
inn
cat
he
walked
down
the
quaint
cobbled
street
to
the
harbour
sauntered
along
the
shore
and
lay
on
his
back
on
the
little
beach
at
the
other
side
of
the
lagoon
from
where
he
could
see
the
red
roofs
of
the
village
while
the
imitation
waves
splashed
busily
on
the
stones
trying
to
conceal
with
bustle
and
energy
the
fact
that
the
water
even
two
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
was
only
eighteen
inches
deep
for
it
is
the
abiding
hope
of
belpher
creek
that
it
may
be
able
to
deceive
the
occasional
visitor
into
mistaking
it
for
the
open
sea
and
presently
the
tide
would
ebb
the
waste
of
waters
became
a
sea
of
mud
cheerfully
covered
as
to
much
of
its
surface
with
green
grasses
the
evening
sun
struck
rainbow
colours
from
the
moist
softness
birds
sang
in
the
thickets
and
george
heaving
himself
up
walked
back
to
the
friendly
cosiness
of
the
marshmoreton
arms
and
the
remarkable
part
of
it
was
that
everything
seemed
perfectly
natural
and
sensible
to
him
nor
had
he
any
particular
feeling
that
in
falling
in
love
with
lady
maud
marsh
and
pursuing
her
to
belpher
he
had
set
himself
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
hopeless
task
like
one
kissed
by
a
goddess
in
a
dream
he
walked
on
air
and
while
one
is
walking
on
air
it
is
easy
to
overlook
the
boulders
in
the
path
consider
his
position
you
and
young
men
who
think
you
have
a
tough
row
to
hoe
just
because
when
you
pay
your
evening
visit
with
the
pound
box
of
candy
under
your
arm
you
see
the
handsome
sophomore
from
yale
sitting
beside
her
on
the
porch
playing
the
ukulele
if
ever
the
world
has
turned
black
to
you
in
such
a
situation
and
the
moon
gone
in
behind
a
cloud
think
of
george
bevan
and
what
he
was
up
against
you
are
at
least
on
the
spot
you
can
at
least
put
up
a
fight
if
there
are
ukuleles
in
the
world
there
are
also
guitars
and
tomorrow
it
may
be
you
and
not
he
who
sits
on
the
moonlit
porch
it
may
be
he
and
not
you
who
arrives
late
who
knows
tomorrow
he
may
not
show
up
till
you
have
finished
the
bedouin
love
song
and
are
annoying
the
local
birds
roosting
in
the
trees
with
poor
butterfly
what
i
mean
to
say
is
you
are
on
the
map
you
have
a
sporting
chance
whereas
george
well
just
go
over
to
england
and
try
wooing
an
earl
daughter
whom
you
have
only
met
once
and
then
without
an
introduction
whose
brother
hat
you
have
smashed
beyond
repair
whose
family
wishes
her
to
marry
some
other
man
who
wants
to
marry
some
other
man
herself
and
not
the
same
other
man
but
another
other
man
who
is
closely
immured
in
a
mediaeval
castle
well
all
i
say
is
try
it
and
then
go
back
to
your
porch
with
a
chastened
spirit
and
admit
that
you
might
be
a
whole
lot
worse
off
george
as
i
say
had
not
envisaged
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
his
position
nor
did
he
until
the
evening
of
his
second
day
at
the
marshmoreton
arms
until
then
as
i
have
indicated
he
roamed
in
a
golden
mist
of
dreamy
meditation
among
the
soothing
of
the
village
of
belpher
but
after
lunch
on
the
second
day
it
came
upon
him
that
all
this
sort
of
thing
was
pleasant
but
not
practical
action
was
what
was
needed
action
the
first
the
obvious
move
was
to
locate
the
castle
inquiries
at
the
marshmoreton
arms
elicited
the
fact
that
it
was
a
step
up
the
road
that
ran
past
the
front
door
of
the
inn
but
this
was
the
day
of
the
week
when
the
general
public
was
admitted
the
sightseer
could
invade
belpher
castle
on
thursdays
only
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
on
other
days
of
the
week
all
he
could
do
was
to
stand
like
moses
on
pisgah
and
take
in
the
general
effect
from
a
distance
as
this
was
all
that
george
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
do
he
set
forth
it
speedily
became
evident
to
george
that
a
step
was
a
euphemism
five
miles
did
he
tramp
before
trudging
wearily
up
a
winding
lane
he
came
out
on
a
and
saw
below
him
nestling
in
its
trees
what
was
now
for
him
the
centre
of
the
world
he
sat
on
a
stone
wall
and
lit
a
pipe
belpher
castle
maud
home
there
it
was
and
now
what
the
first
thought
that
came
to
him
was
practical
even
prosaic
the
thought
that
he
could
possibly
do
this
walk
every
time
he
wanted
to
see
the
place
he
must
shift
his
base
nearer
the
scene
of
operations
one
of
those
trim
thatched
cottages
down
there
in
the
valley
would
be
just
the
thing
if
he
could
arrange
to
take
possession
of
it
they
sat
there
all
round
the
castle
singly
and
in
groups
like
small
dogs
round
their
master
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
there
for
centuries
probably
they
had
as
they
were
made
of
stone
as
solid
as
that
of
the
castle
there
must
have
been
a
time
thought
george
when
the
castle
was
the
central
for
all
those
scattered
homes
when
rumour
of
danger
from
marauders
had
sent
all
that
little
community
scuttling
for
safety
to
the
sheltering
walls
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
set
out
on
his
expedition
a
certain
chill
a
discomforting
sinking
of
the
heart
afflicted
george
as
he
gazed
down
at
the
grim
grey
fortress
which
he
had
undertaken
to
storm
so
must
have
felt
those
marauders
of
old
when
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
this
very
hill
to
spy
out
the
land
and
george
case
was
even
worse
than
theirs
they
could
at
least
hope
that
a
strong
arm
and
a
stout
heart
would
carry
them
past
those
solid
walls
they
had
not
to
think
of
social
etiquette
whereas
george
was
so
situated
that
an
unsympathetic
butler
could
put
him
to
rout
by
refusing
him
admittance
the
evening
was
drawing
in
already
in
the
brief
time
he
had
spent
on
the
the
sky
had
turned
from
blue
to
saffron
and
from
saffron
to
grey
the
plaintive
voices
of
homing
cows
floated
up
to
him
from
the
valley
below
a
bat
had
left
its
shelter
and
was
wheeling
around
him
a
sinister
blot
against
the
sky
a
sickle
moon
gleamed
over
the
trees
george
felt
cold
he
turned
the
shadows
of
night
wrapped
him
round
and
little
things
in
the
hedgerows
chirped
and
chittered
mockery
at
him
as
he
stumbled
down
the
lane
george
request
for
a
lonely
furnished
cottage
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
did
not
as
he
had
feared
strike
the
belpher
as
the
demand
of
a
lunatic
every
stranger
who
comes
to
belpher
is
automatically
set
down
by
the
natives
as
an
artist
for
the
picturesqueness
of
the
place
has
caused
it
to
be
much
infested
by
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
brush
in
asking
for
a
cottage
indeed
george
did
precisely
as
belpher
society
expected
him
to
do
and
the
agent
was
reaching
for
his
list
almost
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
in
less
than
half
an
hour
george
was
out
in
the
street
again
the
owner
for
the
season
of
what
the
agent
described
as
a
gem
and
the
employer
of
a
farmer
wife
who
lived
and
would
as
was
her
custom
with
artists
come
in
the
morning
and
evening
to
do
for
him
the
interview
would
have
taken
but
a
few
minutes
had
it
not
been
prolonged
by
the
chattiness
of
the
agent
on
the
subject
of
the
occupants
of
the
castle
to
which
george
listened
attentively
he
was
not
greatly
encouraged
by
what
he
heard
of
lord
marshmoreton
the
earl
had
made
himself
notably
unpopular
in
the
village
recently
by
his
firm
the
said
attitude
in
respect
to
a
certain
dispute
about
a
it
was
lady
caroline
and
not
the
peer
who
was
really
to
blame
in
the
matter
but
the
impression
that
george
got
from
the
description
of
lord
marshmoreton
was
that
the
latter
was
a
sort
of
nero
possessing
in
addition
to
the
qualities
of
a
roman
tyrant
many
of
the
least
lovable
traits
of
the
ghila
monster
of
arizona
hearing
this
about
her
father
and
having
already
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
her
brother
and
studying
him
at
first
hand
his
heart
bled
for
maud
it
seemed
to
him
that
existence
at
the
castle
in
such
society
must
be
little
short
of
torture
i
must
do
something
he
muttered
i
must
do
something
quick
beg
pardon
said
the
nothing
said
george
well
i
take
that
cottage
i
better
write
you
a
cheque
for
the
first
month
rent
now
so
george
took
up
his
abode
full
of
strenuous
if
vague
purpose
in
the
but
not
uncomfortable
cottage
known
locally
as
the
one
down
by
platt
he
might
have
found
a
worse
billet
it
was
a
building
of
stained
red
brick
not
one
of
the
thatched
nests
on
which
he
had
looked
down
from
the
hill
those
were
not
for
rent
being
occupied
by
families
whose
ancestors
had
occupied
them
for
generations
back
the
one
down
by
was
a
more
modern
structure
a
speculation
in
fact
of
the
farmer
whose
wife
came
to
do
for
george
and
designed
especially
to
accommodate
the
stranger
who
had
the
desire
and
the
money
to
rent
it
it
so
departed
from
type
that
it
possessed
a
small
but
undeniable
besides
this
miracle
there
was
a
cosy
a
larger
bedroom
on
the
floor
above
and
next
to
this
an
empty
room
facing
north
which
had
evidently
served
artist
occupants
as
a
studio
the
remainder
of
the
ground
floor
was
taken
up
by
kitchen
and
scullery
the
furniture
had
been
constructed
by
somebody
who
would
probably
have
done
very
well
if
he
had
taken
up
some
other
line
of
industry
but
it
was
mitigated
by
a
very
fine
and
comfortable
wicker
easy
chair
left
there
by
one
of
last
artists
and
other
artists
had
helped
along
the
good
work
by
relieving
the
plainness
of
the
walls
with
a
landscape
or
two
in
fact
when
george
had
removed
from
the
room
two
antimacassars
three
group
photographs
of
the
farmer
relations
an
illuminated
text
and
a
china
statuette
of
the
infant
samuel
and
stacked
them
in
a
corner
of
the
empty
studio
the
place
became
almost
a
home
from
home
solitude
can
be
very
unsolitary
if
a
man
is
in
love
george
never
even
began
to
be
bored
the
only
thing
that
in
any
way
troubled
his
peace
was
the
thought
that
he
was
not
accomplishing
a
great
deal
in
the
matter
of
helping
maud
out
of
whatever
trouble
it
was
that
had
befallen
her
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
prowl
about
roads
near
the
castle
in
the
hope
of
an
accidental
meeting
and
such
was
his
good
fortune
that
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
vigil
the
accidental
meeting
occurred
taking
his
morning
prowl
along
the
lanes
he
was
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
a
grey
at
the
side
of
the
road
it
was
empty
but
from
underneath
it
protruded
a
pair
of
long
legs
while
beside
it
stood
a
girl
at
the
sight
of
whom
george
heart
began
to
thump
so
violently
that
the
one
might
have
been
pardoned
had
he
supposed
that
his
engine
had
started
again
of
its
own
volition
until
he
spoke
the
soft
grass
had
kept
her
from
hearing
his
approach
he
stopped
close
behind
her
and
cleared
his
throat
she
started
and
turned
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
hers
were
empty
of
any
recognition
then
they
lit
up
she
caught
her
breath
quickly
and
a
faint
flush
came
into
her
face
can
i
help
you
asked
george
the
long
legs
wriggled
out
into
the
road
followed
by
a
long
body
the
young
man
under
the
car
sat
up
turning
a
and
pleasant
face
to
george
eh
what
can
i
help
you
i
know
how
to
fix
a
car
the
young
man
beamed
in
friendly
fashion
it
awfully
good
of
you
old
chap
but
so
do
i
it
the
only
thing
i
can
do
well
thanks
very
much
and
so
forth
all
the
same
george
fastened
his
eyes
on
the
girl
she
had
not
spoken
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
i
can
possibly
do
for
you
he
said
slowly
i
hope
you
will
let
me
know
i
should
like
above
all
things
to
help
you
the
girl
spoke
thank
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
almost
inaudible
george
walked
away
the
young
man
followed
him
with
his
gaze
civil
cove
that
he
said
rather
gushing
though
what
american
was
he
yes
i
think
he
was
americans
are
the
civillest
coves
i
ever
struck
i
remember
asking
the
way
of
a
chappie
at
baltimore
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
i
was
there
in
my
yacht
and
he
followed
me
for
miles
shrieking
advice
and
encouragement
i
thought
it
deuced
civil
of
him
i
wish
you
would
hurry
up
and
get
the
car
right
reggie
we
shall
be
awfully
late
for
lunch
reggie
byng
began
to
slide
backwards
under
the
car
all
right
dear
heart
rely
on
me
it
something
quite
simple
well
do
be
quick
imitation
of
greased
lightning
very
difficult
said
reggie
encouragingly
be
patient
try
and
amuse
yourself
somehow
ask
yourself
a
riddle
tell
yourself
a
few
anecdotes
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
i
say
i
wonder
what
the
cove
is
doing
at
belpher
deuced
civil
cove
said
reggie
approvingly
i
liked
him
and
now
business
of
repairing
breakdown
his
smiling
face
vanished
under
the
car
like
the
cheshire
cat
maud
stood
looking
thoughtfully
down
the
road
in
the
direction
in
which
george
had
disappeared
chapter
the
following
day
was
a
thursday
and
on
thursdays
as
has
been
stated
belpher
castle
was
thrown
open
to
the
general
public
between
the
hours
of
two
and
four
it
was
a
tradition
of
long
standing
this
periodical
lowering
of
the
barriers
and
had
always
been
faithfully
observed
by
lord
marshmoreton
ever
since
his
accession
to
the
title
by
the
permanent
occupants
of
the
castle
the
day
was
regarded
with
mixed
feelings
lord
belpher
while
approving
of
it
in
theory
as
he
did
of
all
the
family
traditions
for
he
was
a
great
supporter
of
all
things
feudal
and
took
his
position
as
one
of
the
hereditary
aristocracy
of
great
britain
extremely
seriously
heartily
disliked
it
in
practice
more
than
once
he
had
been
obliged
to
exit
hastily
by
a
further
door
in
order
to
keep
from
being
discovered
by
a
drove
of
tourists
intent
on
inspecting
the
library
or
the
great
and
now
it
was
his
custom
to
retire
to
his
bedroom
immediately
after
lunch
and
not
to
emerge
until
the
tide
of
invasion
had
ebbed
away
keggs
the
butler
always
looked
forward
to
thursdays
with
pleasurable
anticipation
he
enjoyed
the
sense
of
authority
which
it
gave
him
to
herd
these
poor
outcasts
to
and
fro
among
the
surroundings
which
were
an
everyday
commonplace
to
himself
also
he
liked
hearing
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
as
it
lectured
in
rolling
periods
on
the
objects
of
interest
by
the
but
even
to
keggs
there
was
a
bitter
mixed
with
the
sweet
no
one
was
better
aware
than
himself
that
the
nobility
of
his
manner
excellent
as
a
means
of
impressing
the
mob
worked
against
him
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
tips
again
and
again
had
he
been
harrowed
by
the
spectacle
of
tourists
huddled
together
like
sheep
debating
among
themselves
in
nervous
whispers
as
to
whether
they
could
offer
this
personage
anything
so
contemptible
as
half
a
crown
for
himself
and
deciding
that
such
an
insult
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
his
endeavour
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
proceedings
to
cultivate
a
manner
blending
a
dignity
fitting
his
position
with
a
sunny
geniality
which
would
allay
the
timid
doubts
of
the
tourist
and
indicate
to
him
that
bizarre
as
the
idea
might
seem
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
placing
his
poor
silver
in
more
worthy
hands
possibly
the
only
member
of
the
castle
community
who
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
these
public
visits
was
lord
marshmoreton
he
made
no
difference
between
thursday
and
any
other
day
precisely
as
usual
he
donned
his
stained
corduroys
and
pottered
about
his
beloved
garden
and
when
as
happened
on
an
average
once
a
quarter
some
visitor
strayed
from
the
main
herd
came
upon
him
as
he
worked
and
mistook
him
for
one
of
the
gardeners
he
accepted
the
error
without
any
attempt
at
explanation
sometimes
going
so
far
as
to
encourage
it
by
adopting
a
rustic
accent
in
keeping
with
his
appearance
this
sort
of
thing
tickled
the
peer
george
joined
the
procession
punctually
at
two
just
as
keggs
was
clearing
his
throat
preparatory
to
saying
we
are
now
in
the
main
and
before
going
any
further
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
sir
peter
lely
portrait
of
it
was
his
custom
to
begin
his
thursday
lectures
with
this
remark
but
today
it
was
postponed
for
no
sooner
had
george
appeared
than
a
breezy
voice
on
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
spoke
in
a
tone
that
made
competition
impossible
for
goodness
sake
george
and
billie
dore
detached
herself
from
the
group
a
trim
vision
in
blue
she
wore
a
and
a
motor
veil
and
her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
glowing
from
the
fresh
air
for
goodness
sake
george
what
are
you
doing
here
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
the
same
thing
oh
i
motored
down
with
a
boy
i
know
we
had
a
breakdown
just
outside
the
gates
we
were
on
our
way
to
brighton
for
lunch
he
suggested
i
should
pass
the
time
seeing
the
sights
while
he
fixed
up
the
sprockets
or
the
differential
gear
or
whatever
it
was
coming
to
pick
me
up
when
he
through
but
on
the
level
george
how
do
you
get
this
way
you
sneak
out
of
town
and
leave
the
show
flat
and
nobody
has
a
notion
where
you
are
why
we
were
thinking
of
advertising
for
you
or
going
to
the
police
or
something
for
all
anybody
knew
you
might
have
been
sandbagged
or
dropped
in
the
river
this
aspect
of
the
matter
had
not
occurred
to
george
till
now
his
sudden
descent
on
belpher
had
seemed
to
him
the
only
natural
course
to
pursue
he
had
not
realized
that
he
would
be
missed
and
that
his
absence
might
have
caused
grave
inconvenience
to
a
large
number
of
people
i
never
thought
of
that
i
well
i
just
happened
to
come
here
you
are
living
in
this
old
castle
not
quite
i
a
cottage
down
the
road
i
wanted
a
few
days
in
the
country
so
i
rented
it
but
what
made
you
choose
this
place
keggs
who
had
been
regarding
these
disturbers
of
the
peace
with
dignified
disapproval
coughed
if
you
would
not
mind
madam
we
are
waiting
eh
how
that
miss
dore
looked
up
with
a
bright
smile
sorry
come
along
george
get
in
the
game
she
nodded
cheerfully
to
the
butler
all
right
all
set
now
you
may
fire
when
ready
gridley
keggs
bowed
austerely
and
cleared
his
throat
again
we
are
now
in
the
main
and
before
going
any
further
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
sir
peter
lely
portrait
of
the
fifth
countess
said
by
experts
to
be
in
his
best
manner
there
was
an
almost
soundless
murmur
from
the
mob
expressive
of
wonder
and
awe
like
a
gentle
breeze
rustling
leaves
billie
dore
resumed
her
conversation
in
a
whisper
yes
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
excitement
when
they
found
that
you
had
disappeared
they
were
phoning
the
carlton
every
ten
minutes
trying
to
get
you
you
see
the
summertime
number
flopped
on
the
second
night
and
they
had
anything
to
put
in
its
place
but
it
all
right
they
took
it
out
and
sewed
up
the
wound
and
now
you
never
know
there
had
been
anything
wrong
the
show
was
ten
minutes
too
long
anyway
how
the
show
going
it
a
riot
they
think
it
will
run
two
years
in
london
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
you
do
call
it
a
success
in
london
unless
you
can
take
your
grandchildren
to
see
the
thousandth
night
that
splendid
and
how
is
everybody
all
right
fine
that
fellow
gray
is
still
hanging
round
babe
it
beats
me
what
she
sees
in
him
anybody
but
an
infant
could
see
the
man
was
on
the
level
well
i
do
blame
you
for
quitting
london
george
this
sort
of
thing
is
worth
fifty
londons
the
procession
had
reached
one
of
the
upper
rooms
and
they
were
looking
down
from
a
window
that
commanded
a
sweep
of
miles
of
the
countryside
rolling
and
green
and
wooded
far
away
beyond
the
last
covert
belpher
bay
gleamed
like
a
streak
of
silver
billie
dore
gave
a
little
sigh
there
nothing
like
this
in
the
world
i
like
to
stand
here
for
the
rest
of
my
life
just
lapping
it
up
i
will
call
your
attention
boomed
keggs
at
their
elbow
to
this
window
known
in
the
tredition
as
leonard
leap
it
was
in
the
year
seventeen
and
that
lord
leonard
forth
eldest
son
of
grace
the
dook
of
lochlane
out
of
this
window
in
order
to
avoid
compromising
the
beautiful
countess
of
marshmoreton
with
oom
is
related
to
a
ninnocent
romance
surprised
at
an
advanced
hour
by
lordship
the
earl
in
ladyship
boudoir
as
this
room
then
was
leaped
through
the
open
window
into
the
boughs
of
the
cedar
tree
which
stands
below
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
escape
with
a
few
contusions
a
murmur
of
admiration
greeted
the
recital
of
the
ready
tact
of
this
steve
brodie
there
said
billie
enthusiastically
that
exactly
what
i
mean
about
this
country
it
just
a
mass
of
leonard
leaps
and
things
i
like
to
settle
down
in
this
sort
of
place
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
milking
cows
and
taking
forkfuls
of
soup
to
the
deserving
villagers
we
will
now
said
keggs
herding
the
mob
with
a
gesture
proceed
to
the
amber
containing
some
gobelin
tapestries
spoken
of
by
connoozers
the
obedient
mob
began
to
drift
out
in
his
wake
what
do
you
say
george
asked
billie
in
an
undertone
if
we
the
amber
i
wild
to
get
into
that
garden
there
a
man
working
among
those
roses
maybe
he
would
show
us
round
george
followed
her
pointing
finger
just
below
them
a
sturdy
man
in
corduroys
was
pausing
to
light
a
stubby
pipe
just
as
you
like
they
made
their
way
down
the
great
staircase
the
voice
of
keggs
saying
complimentary
things
about
the
gobelin
tapestry
came
to
their
ears
like
the
roll
of
distant
drums
they
wandered
out
towards
the
the
man
in
corduroys
had
lit
his
pipe
and
was
bending
once
more
to
his
task
well
dadda
said
billie
amiably
how
are
the
crops
the
man
straightened
himself
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
the
kind
eyes
of
a
friendly
dog
he
smiled
genially
and
started
to
put
his
pipe
away
billie
stopped
him
do
stop
smoking
on
my
account
she
said
i
like
it
well
you
got
the
right
sort
of
a
job
have
you
if
i
was
a
man
there
nothing
i
like
better
than
to
put
in
my
eight
hours
in
a
she
looked
about
her
and
this
she
said
with
approval
is
just
what
a
ought
to
be
are
you
fond
of
roses
missy
you
bet
i
am
you
must
have
every
kind
here
that
was
ever
invented
all
the
varieties
there
are
nearly
three
thousand
varieties
said
the
man
in
corduroys
tolerantly
i
was
speaking
colloquially
dadda
you
ca
teach
me
anything
about
roses
i
the
guy
that
invented
them
got
any
ayrshires
the
man
in
corduroys
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
billie
was
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
mattered
this
revelation
of
a
kindred
spirit
had
captured
him
completely
george
was
merely
among
those
present
those
them
over
there
are
ayrshires
missy
we
do
get
ayrshires
in
america
at
least
i
never
ran
across
them
i
suppose
they
do
have
them
you
want
the
right
soil
clay
and
lots
of
rain
you
right
there
was
an
earnest
expression
on
billie
dore
face
that
george
had
never
seen
there
before
say
listen
dadda
in
this
matter
of
what
would
you
do
if
george
moved
away
the
conversation
was
becoming
too
technical
for
him
and
he
had
an
idea
that
he
would
not
be
missed
there
had
come
to
him
moreover
in
a
flash
one
of
those
sudden
inspirations
which
great
generals
get
he
had
visited
the
castle
this
afternoon
without
any
settled
plan
other
than
a
vague
hope
that
he
might
somehow
see
maud
he
now
perceived
that
there
was
no
chance
of
doing
this
evidently
on
thursdays
the
family
went
to
earth
and
remained
hidden
until
the
sightseers
had
gone
but
there
was
another
avenue
of
communication
open
to
him
this
gardener
seemed
an
exceptionally
intelligent
man
he
could
be
trusted
to
deliver
a
note
to
maud
in
his
late
rambles
about
belpher
castle
in
the
company
of
keggs
and
his
followers
george
had
been
privileged
to
inspect
the
library
it
was
an
easily
accessible
room
opening
off
the
main
hall
he
left
billie
and
her
new
friend
deep
in
a
discussion
of
slugs
and
and
walked
quickly
back
to
the
house
the
library
was
unoccupied
george
was
a
thorough
young
man
he
believed
in
leaving
nothing
to
chance
the
gardener
had
seemed
a
trustworthy
soul
but
you
never
knew
it
was
possible
that
he
drank
he
might
forget
or
lose
the
precious
note
so
with
a
wary
eye
on
the
door
george
hastily
scribbled
it
in
duplicate
this
took
him
but
a
few
minutes
he
went
out
into
the
garden
again
to
find
billie
dore
on
the
point
of
stepping
into
a
blue
automobile
oh
there
you
are
george
i
wondered
where
you
had
got
to
say
i
made
quite
a
hit
with
dadda
i
given
him
my
address
and
promised
to
send
me
a
whole
lot
of
roses
by
the
way
shake
hands
with
forsyth
this
is
george
bevan
freddie
who
wrote
the
music
of
our
show
the
solemn
youth
at
the
wheel
extended
a
hand
topping
show
topping
music
topping
all
round
well
george
see
you
soon
i
suppose
oh
yes
give
my
love
to
everybody
all
right
let
her
rip
freddie
the
blue
car
gathered
speed
and
vanished
down
the
drive
george
returned
to
the
man
in
corduroys
who
had
bent
himself
double
in
pursuit
of
a
slug
just
a
minute
said
george
hurriedly
he
pulled
out
the
first
of
the
notes
give
this
to
lady
maud
the
first
chance
you
get
important
here
a
sovereign
for
your
trouble
he
hastened
away
he
noticed
that
gratification
had
turned
the
other
nearly
purple
in
the
face
and
was
anxious
to
leave
him
he
was
a
modest
young
man
and
effusive
thanks
always
embarrassed
him
there
now
remained
the
disposal
of
the
duplicate
note
it
was
hardly
worth
while
perhaps
taking
such
a
precaution
but
george
knew
that
victories
are
won
by
those
who
take
no
chances
he
had
wandered
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
from
the
when
he
encountered
a
small
boy
in
the
uniform
of
a
page
the
boy
had
appeared
from
behind
a
big
cedar
where
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
been
smoking
a
stolen
cigarette
do
you
want
to
earn
half
a
crown
asked
george
the
market
value
of
messengers
had
slumped
the
stripling
held
his
hand
out
give
this
note
to
lady
maud
right
ho
see
that
it
reaches
her
at
once
george
walked
off
with
the
consciousness
of
a
good
day
work
done
albert
the
page
having
bitten
his
placed
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
hurried
away
a
look
of
excitement
and
gratification
in
his
deep
blue
eyes
chapter
while
george
and
billie
dore
wandered
to
the
rose
garden
to
interview
the
man
in
corduroys
maud
had
been
seated
not
a
hundred
yards
away
in
a
very
special
haunt
of
her
own
a
cracked
stucco
temple
set
up
in
the
days
of
the
regency
on
the
shores
of
a
little
pond
she
was
reading
poetry
to
albert
the
page
albert
the
page
was
a
recent
addition
to
maud
inner
circle
she
had
interested
herself
in
him
some
two
months
back
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
the
prisoner
in
his
dungeon
cell
tames
and
pets
the
conventional
mouse
to
educate
albert
to
raise
him
above
his
groove
in
life
and
develop
his
soul
appealed
to
her
romantic
nature
as
a
worthy
task
and
as
a
good
way
of
filling
in
the
time
it
is
an
exceedingly
moot
point
and
one
which
his
associates
of
the
servants
hall
would
have
combated
hotly
whether
albert
possessed
a
soul
the
most
one
could
say
for
certain
is
that
he
looked
as
if
he
possessed
one
to
one
who
saw
his
deep
blue
eyes
and
their
sweet
pensive
expression
as
they
searched
the
middle
distance
he
seemed
like
a
young
angel
how
was
the
watcher
to
know
that
the
thought
behind
that
gaze
was
simply
a
speculation
as
to
whether
the
bird
on
the
cedar
tree
was
or
was
not
within
range
of
his
catapult
certainly
maud
had
no
such
suspicion
she
worked
hopefully
day
by
day
to
rouse
albert
to
an
appreciation
of
the
nobler
things
of
life
not
but
what
it
was
tough
going
even
she
admitted
that
soul
did
not
soar
readily
it
refused
to
leap
from
the
earth
his
reception
of
the
poem
she
was
reading
could
scarcely
have
been
called
encouraging
maud
finished
it
in
a
hushed
voice
and
looked
pensively
across
the
dappled
water
of
the
pool
a
gentle
breeze
stirred
the
so
that
they
seemed
to
sigh
is
that
beautiful
albert
she
said
albert
blue
eyes
lit
up
his
lips
parted
eagerly
that
the
first
hornet
i
seen
this
year
he
said
pointing
maud
felt
a
little
damped
have
you
been
listening
albert
oh
yes
ai
he
a
wopper
too
never
mind
the
hornet
albert
very
good
i
wish
you
would
say
good
it
like
like
she
paused
she
had
been
about
to
say
that
it
was
like
a
butler
but
she
reflected
regretfully
it
was
probably
albert
dearest
ambition
to
be
like
a
butler
it
does
sound
right
just
say
yes
maud
was
not
enthusiastic
about
the
but
she
let
it
go
after
all
she
had
not
quite
settled
in
her
own
mind
what
exactly
she
wished
albert
attitude
towards
herself
to
be
broadly
speaking
she
wanted
him
to
be
as
like
as
he
could
to
a
medieval
page
one
of
those
little
treasures
she
had
read
about
in
the
ingoldsby
legends
and
of
course
they
presumably
said
lady
and
yet
she
felt
not
for
the
first
time
that
it
is
not
easy
to
revive
the
middle
ages
in
these
curious
days
pages
like
other
things
seem
to
have
changed
since
then
that
poem
was
written
by
a
very
clever
man
who
married
one
of
my
ancestresses
he
ran
away
with
her
from
this
very
castle
in
the
seventeenth
century
lor
said
albert
as
a
concession
but
he
was
still
interested
in
the
hornet
he
was
far
below
her
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
she
knew
what
a
wonderful
man
he
was
so
she
did
mind
what
people
said
about
her
marrying
beneath
her
like
susan
when
she
married
the
pleeceman
who
was
susan
gel
that
used
to
be
cook
keggs
says
to
says
marrying
beneath
you
susan
says
i
i
was
listenin
at
the
door
and
she
says
to
she
says
go
and
boil
your
fat
she
says
this
translation
of
a
favourite
romance
into
terms
of
the
hall
chilled
maud
like
a
cold
shower
she
recoiled
from
it
would
you
like
to
get
a
good
education
albert
she
said
perseveringly
and
become
a
great
poet
and
write
wonderful
poems
albert
considered
the
point
and
shook
his
head
no
it
was
discouraging
but
maud
was
a
girl
of
pluck
you
can
not
leap
into
strange
cabs
in
piccadilly
unless
you
have
pluck
she
picked
up
another
book
from
the
stone
seat
read
me
some
of
this
she
said
and
then
tell
me
if
it
make
you
feel
you
want
to
do
big
things
albert
took
the
book
cautiously
he
was
getting
a
little
fed
up
with
all
this
sort
of
thing
true
ladyship
gave
him
chocolates
to
eat
during
these
sessions
but
for
all
that
it
was
too
much
like
school
for
his
taste
he
regarded
the
open
page
with
disfavour
go
on
said
maud
closing
her
eyes
it
very
beautiful
albert
began
he
had
a
husky
voice
due
it
is
to
be
feared
to
precocious
cigarette
smoking
and
his
enunciation
was
not
as
good
as
it
might
have
been
wiv
blekest
morss
the
mean
one
and
orl
ther
rusted
niles
fell
from
the
knorts
that
the
pear
to
the
ther
broken
sheds
looked
sed
and
stringe
unlifted
was
the
clinking
latch
weeded
and
worn
their
ancient
thatch
ther
lownely
moated
gringe
she
only
said
life
is
dreary
cometh
not
she
said
albert
rather
liked
this
part
he
was
never
happy
in
narrative
unless
it
could
be
sprinkled
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
he
said
and
she
said
he
finished
with
some
gusto
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
was
dead
maud
had
listened
to
this
rendition
of
one
of
her
most
adored
poems
with
much
the
same
feeling
which
a
composer
with
an
ear
would
suffer
on
hearing
his
pet
opus
assassinated
by
a
schoolgirl
albert
who
was
a
willing
lad
and
prepared
if
such
should
be
her
desire
to
plough
his
way
through
the
entire
seven
stanzas
began
the
second
verse
but
maud
gently
took
the
book
away
from
him
enough
was
sufficient
now
would
you
like
to
be
able
to
write
a
wonderful
thing
like
that
albert
not
me
you
would
like
to
be
a
poet
when
you
grow
up
albert
shook
his
golden
head
i
want
to
be
a
butcher
when
i
grow
up
maud
uttered
a
little
cry
a
butcher
yus
butchers
earn
good
money
he
said
a
light
of
enthusiasm
in
his
blue
eyes
for
he
was
now
on
his
favourite
subject
you
got
to
meat
yer
see
it
ai
like
poetry
which
no
one
wants
but
albert
cried
maud
faintly
killing
poor
animals
surely
you
would
like
that
albert
eyes
glowed
softly
as
might
an
acolyte
at
the
sight
of
the
censer
widgeon
down
at
the
farm
he
murmured
reverently
he
says
if
i
a
good
boy
let
me
watch
kill
a
pig
toosday
he
gazed
out
over
the
his
thoughts
far
away
maud
shuddered
she
wondered
if
medieval
pages
were
ever
quite
as
earthy
as
this
perhaps
you
had
better
go
now
albert
they
may
be
needing
you
in
the
house
very
good
albert
rose
not
unwilling
to
call
it
a
day
he
was
conscious
of
the
need
for
a
quiet
cigarette
he
was
fond
of
maud
but
a
man
ca
spend
all
his
time
with
the
women
pigs
squeal
like
he
observed
by
way
of
adding
a
parting
treasure
to
maud
stock
of
general
knowledge
oo
a
mile
orf
you
can
maud
remained
where
she
was
thinking
a
wistful
figure
tennyson
mariana
always
made
her
wistful
even
when
rendered
by
albert
in
the
occasional
moods
of
sentimental
depression
which
came
to
vary
her
normal
cheerfulness
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
poem
might
have
been
written
with
a
prophetic
eye
to
her
special
case
so
nearly
did
it
crystallize
in
magic
words
her
own
story
with
blackest
moss
the
were
thickly
crusted
one
and
all
well
no
not
that
particular
part
perhaps
if
he
had
found
so
much
as
one
of
his
even
thinly
crusted
with
any
foreign
substance
lord
marshmoreton
would
have
gone
through
the
place
like
an
east
wind
dismissing
gardeners
and
with
every
breath
but
she
only
said
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
how
exactly
at
these
moments
when
she
was
not
out
on
the
links
picking
them
off
the
turf
with
a
midiron
or
engaged
in
one
of
those
other
healthful
sports
which
tend
to
take
the
mind
off
its
troubles
those
words
summed
up
her
case
why
did
geoffrey
come
or
at
least
write
she
could
not
write
to
him
letters
from
the
castle
left
only
by
way
of
the
castle
which
rogers
the
chauffeur
took
down
to
the
village
every
evening
impossible
to
entrust
the
kind
of
letter
she
wished
to
write
to
any
mode
of
delivery
so
public
especially
now
when
her
movements
were
watched
to
open
and
read
another
letters
is
a
low
and
dastardly
act
but
she
believed
that
lady
caroline
would
do
it
like
a
shot
she
longed
to
pour
out
her
heart
to
geoffrey
in
a
long
intimate
letter
but
she
did
not
dare
to
take
the
risk
of
writing
for
a
wider
public
things
were
bad
enough
as
it
was
after
that
disastrous
sortie
to
london
at
this
point
a
soothing
vision
came
to
her
the
vision
of
george
bevan
knocking
off
her
brother
percy
hat
it
was
the
only
pleasant
thing
that
had
happened
almost
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
and
then
for
the
first
time
her
mind
condescended
to
dwell
for
a
moment
on
the
author
of
that
act
george
bevan
the
friend
in
need
whom
she
had
met
only
the
day
before
in
the
lane
what
was
george
doing
at
belpher
his
presence
there
was
significant
and
his
words
even
more
so
he
had
stated
explicitly
that
he
wished
to
help
her
she
found
herself
oppressed
by
the
irony
of
things
a
knight
had
come
to
the
rescue
but
the
wrong
knight
why
could
it
not
have
been
geoffrey
who
waited
in
ambush
outside
the
castle
and
not
a
pleasant
but
negligible
stranger
whether
deep
down
in
her
consciousness
she
was
aware
of
a
fleeting
sense
of
disappointment
in
geoffrey
a
swiftly
passing
thought
that
he
had
failed
her
she
could
hardly
have
said
so
quickly
did
she
crush
it
down
she
pondered
on
the
arrival
of
george
what
was
the
use
of
his
being
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
if
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
where
she
could
find
him
situated
as
she
was
she
could
not
wander
at
will
about
the
countryside
looking
for
him
and
even
if
she
found
him
what
then
there
was
not
much
that
any
stranger
however
pleasant
could
do
she
flushed
at
a
sudden
thought
of
course
there
was
something
george
could
do
for
her
if
he
were
willing
he
could
receive
despatch
and
deliver
letters
if
only
she
could
get
in
touch
with
him
she
could
through
him
get
in
touch
with
geoffrey
the
whole
world
changed
for
her
the
sun
was
setting
and
chill
little
winds
had
begun
to
stir
the
giving
a
depressing
air
to
the
scene
but
to
maud
it
seemed
as
if
all
nature
smiled
with
the
egotism
of
love
she
did
not
perceive
that
what
she
proposed
to
ask
george
to
do
was
practically
to
fulfil
the
humble
role
of
the
hollow
tree
in
which
lovers
dump
letters
to
be
extracted
later
she
did
not
consider
george
feelings
at
all
he
had
offered
to
help
her
and
this
was
his
job
the
world
is
full
of
georges
whose
task
it
is
to
hang
about
in
the
background
and
make
themselves
unobtrusively
useful
she
had
reached
this
conclusion
when
albert
who
had
taken
a
short
cut
the
more
rapidly
to
accomplish
his
errand
burst
upon
her
dramatically
from
the
heart
of
a
rhododendron
thicket
gentleman
give
me
this
to
give
yer
maud
read
the
note
it
was
brief
and
to
the
point
i
am
staying
near
the
castle
at
a
cottage
they
call
one
down
by
platt
it
is
a
rather
new
place
you
can
easily
find
it
i
shall
be
waiting
there
if
you
want
me
it
was
signed
the
man
in
the
cab
do
you
know
a
cottage
called
one
down
by
platt
albert
asked
maud
yes
it
down
by
platt
farm
i
see
a
chicken
killed
there
wednesday
week
do
you
know
after
a
chicken
is
cut
orf
it
goes
running
maud
shivered
slightly
albert
fresh
young
enthusiasms
frequently
jarred
upon
her
i
find
a
friend
of
mine
is
staying
there
i
want
you
to
take
a
note
to
him
from
me
very
good
and
albert
yes
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
said
nothing
about
this
to
any
of
your
friends
in
lord
marshmoreton
study
a
council
of
three
was
sitting
in
debate
the
subject
under
discussion
was
that
other
note
which
george
had
written
and
so
entrusted
to
one
whom
he
had
taken
for
a
guileless
gardener
the
council
consisted
of
lord
marshmoreton
looking
rather
shamefaced
his
son
percy
looking
swollen
and
serious
and
lady
caroline
byng
looking
like
a
tragedy
queen
this
lord
belpher
was
saying
in
a
determined
voice
settles
it
from
now
on
maud
must
not
be
allowed
out
of
our
sight
lord
marshmoreton
spoke
i
rather
wish
he
said
regretfully
i
had
spoken
about
the
note
i
only
mentioned
it
because
i
thought
you
might
think
it
amusing
amusing
lady
caroline
voice
shook
the
furniture
amusing
that
the
fellow
should
have
handed
me
of
all
people
a
letter
for
maud
explained
her
brother
i
do
want
to
get
maud
into
trouble
you
are
criminally
weak
said
lady
caroline
severely
i
really
honestly
believe
that
you
were
capable
of
giving
the
note
to
that
poor
misguided
girl
and
saying
nothing
about
it
she
flushed
the
insolence
of
the
man
coming
here
and
settling
down
at
the
very
gates
of
the
castle
if
it
was
anybody
but
this
man
platt
who
was
giving
him
shelter
i
should
insist
on
his
being
turned
out
but
that
man
platt
would
be
only
too
glad
to
know
that
he
is
causing
us
annoyance
quite
said
lord
belpher
you
must
go
to
this
man
as
soon
as
possible
continued
lady
caroline
fixing
her
brother
with
a
commanding
stare
and
do
your
best
to
make
him
see
how
abominable
his
behaviour
is
oh
i
could
pleaded
the
earl
i
do
know
the
fellow
throw
me
out
nonsense
go
at
the
very
earliest
opportunity
oh
all
right
all
right
all
right
well
i
think
i
be
slipping
out
to
the
rose
garden
again
now
there
a
clear
hour
before
dinner
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
alice
faraday
entered
bearing
papers
a
smile
of
sweet
helpfulness
on
her
pretty
face
i
hoped
i
should
find
you
here
lord
marshmoreton
you
promised
to
go
over
these
notes
with
me
the
ones
about
the
essex
branch
the
hunted
peer
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
dive
through
the
window
some
other
time
some
other
time
i
i
have
important
matters
oh
if
you
busy
of
course
lord
marshmoreton
will
be
delighted
to
work
on
your
notes
miss
faraday
said
lady
caroline
crisply
take
this
chair
we
are
just
going
lord
marshmoreton
gave
one
wistful
glance
through
the
open
window
then
he
sat
down
with
a
sigh
and
felt
for
his
chapter
your
true
golfer
is
a
man
who
knowing
that
life
is
short
and
perfection
hard
to
attain
neglects
no
opportunity
of
practising
his
chosen
sport
allowing
neither
wind
nor
weather
nor
any
external
influence
to
keep
him
from
it
there
is
a
story
with
an
excellent
moral
lesson
of
a
golfer
whose
wife
had
determined
to
leave
him
for
ever
will
nothing
alter
your
decision
he
says
will
nothing
induce
you
to
stay
well
then
while
you
packing
i
think
i
go
out
on
the
lawn
and
rub
up
my
putting
a
bit
george
bevan
was
of
this
turn
of
mind
he
might
be
in
love
romance
might
have
sealed
him
for
her
own
but
that
was
no
reason
for
blinding
himself
to
the
fact
that
his
long
game
was
bound
to
suffer
if
he
neglected
to
keep
himself
up
to
the
mark
his
first
act
on
arriving
at
belpher
village
had
been
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
a
links
in
the
neighbourhood
and
thither
on
the
morning
after
his
visit
to
the
castle
and
the
delivery
of
the
two
notes
he
repaired
at
the
hour
of
the
day
which
he
had
selected
the
was
empty
and
he
had
just
resigned
himself
to
a
solitary
game
when
with
a
whirr
and
a
rattle
a
grey
drove
up
and
from
it
emerged
the
same
long
young
man
whom
a
couple
of
days
earlier
he
had
seen
wriggle
out
from
underneath
the
same
machine
it
was
reggie
byng
habit
also
not
to
allow
anything
even
love
to
interfere
with
golf
and
not
even
the
prospect
of
hanging
about
the
castle
grounds
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
alice
faraday
and
exchanging
timorous
words
with
her
had
been
enough
to
keep
him
from
the
links
reggie
surveyed
george
with
a
friendly
eye
he
had
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
him
before
somewhere
at
some
time
or
other
and
reggie
had
the
pleasing
disposition
which
caused
him
to
rank
anybody
whom
he
had
seen
somewhere
at
some
time
or
other
as
a
bosom
friend
hullo
hullo
hullo
he
observed
good
morning
said
george
waiting
for
somebody
no
how
about
it
then
shall
we
stagger
forth
delighted
george
found
himself
speculating
upon
reggie
he
was
unable
to
place
him
that
he
was
a
friend
of
maud
he
knew
and
guessed
that
he
was
also
a
resident
of
the
castle
he
would
have
liked
to
question
reggie
to
probe
him
to
collect
from
him
inside
information
as
to
the
progress
of
events
within
the
castle
walls
but
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
golf
as
of
love
that
it
temporarily
changes
the
natures
of
its
victims
and
reggie
a
confirmed
babbler
off
the
links
became
while
in
action
a
stern
silent
intent
person
his
whole
being
centred
on
the
game
with
the
exception
of
a
casual
remark
of
a
technical
nature
when
he
met
george
on
the
various
tees
and
an
occasional
expletive
when
things
went
wrong
with
his
ball
he
eschewed
conversation
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
the
round
that
he
became
himself
again
if
i
known
you
were
such
hot
stuff
he
declared
generously
as
george
holed
his
eighteenth
putt
from
a
distance
of
ten
feet
have
got
you
to
give
me
a
stroke
or
two
i
was
on
my
game
today
said
george
modestly
sometimes
i
slice
as
if
i
were
cutting
bread
and
ca
putt
to
hit
a
haystack
let
me
know
when
one
of
those
times
comes
along
and
i
take
you
on
again
i
do
know
when
i
seen
anything
fruitier
than
the
way
you
got
out
of
the
bunker
at
the
fifteenth
it
reminded
me
of
a
match
i
saw
between
reggie
became
technical
at
the
end
of
his
observations
he
climbed
into
the
grey
car
can
i
drop
you
anywhere
thanks
said
george
if
it
not
taking
you
out
your
way
i
staying
at
belpher
castle
i
live
quite
near
there
perhaps
you
care
to
come
in
and
have
a
drink
on
your
way
a
ripe
scheme
agreed
reggie
ten
minutes
in
the
grey
car
ate
up
the
distance
between
the
links
and
george
cottage
reggie
byng
passed
these
minutes
in
the
intervals
of
eluding
carts
and
foiling
the
apparently
suicidal
intentions
of
some
stray
fowls
in
jerky
conversation
on
the
subject
of
his
with
which
he
expressed
a
deep
satisfaction
topping
little
place
absolutely
was
the
verdict
he
pronounced
on
the
exterior
of
the
cottage
as
he
followed
george
in
often
thought
it
would
be
a
rather
sound
scheme
to
settle
down
in
this
sort
of
shanty
and
keep
chickens
and
grow
a
honey
coloured
beard
and
have
soup
and
jelly
brought
to
you
by
the
vicar
wife
and
so
forth
nothing
to
worry
you
then
do
you
live
all
alone
here
george
was
busy
squirting
seltzer
into
his
guest
glass
yes
platt
comes
in
and
cooks
for
me
the
farmer
wife
next
door
an
exclamation
from
the
other
caused
him
to
look
up
reggie
byng
was
staring
at
him
great
scott
platt
then
you
the
chappie
george
found
himself
unequal
to
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
conversation
the
chappie
the
chappie
there
all
the
row
about
the
mater
was
telling
me
only
this
morning
that
you
lived
here
is
there
a
row
about
me
is
there
what
reggie
manner
became
solicitous
i
say
my
dear
old
sportsman
i
do
want
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
tidings
and
what
not
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
did
you
know
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
angry
passion
rising
and
so
forth
because
of
you
at
the
castle
i
mean
i
do
want
to
seem
to
be
discussing
your
private
affairs
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
what
i
mean
is
well
you
do
expect
you
can
come
charging
in
the
way
you
have
without
touching
the
family
on
the
raw
a
bit
the
daughter
of
the
house
falls
in
love
with
you
the
son
of
the
house
languishes
in
chokey
because
he
has
a
row
with
you
in
piccadilly
and
on
top
of
all
that
you
come
here
and
camp
out
at
the
castle
gates
naturally
the
family
are
a
bit
peeved
only
natural
eh
i
mean
to
say
what
george
listened
to
this
address
in
bewilderment
maud
in
love
with
him
it
sounded
incredible
that
he
should
love
her
after
their
one
meeting
was
a
different
thing
altogether
that
was
perfectly
natural
and
in
order
but
that
he
should
have
had
the
incredible
luck
to
win
her
affection
the
thing
struck
him
as
grotesque
and
ridiculous
in
love
with
me
he
cried
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
reggie
bewilderment
equalled
his
own
well
dash
it
all
old
top
it
surely
is
news
to
you
she
must
have
told
you
why
she
told
me
told
you
am
i
going
mad
absolutely
i
mean
absolutely
not
look
here
reggie
hesitated
the
subject
was
delicate
but
once
started
it
might
as
well
be
proceeded
with
to
some
conclusion
a
fellow
could
go
on
talking
about
his
after
this
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
this
was
the
time
for
the
laying
down
of
cards
the
opening
of
hearts
i
say
you
know
he
went
on
feeling
his
way
probably
think
it
deuced
rummy
of
me
talking
like
this
perfect
stranger
and
what
not
do
even
know
each
other
names
mine
bevan
if
that
be
any
help
thanks
very
much
old
chap
great
help
mine
byng
reggie
byng
well
as
we
all
pals
here
and
the
meeting
tiled
and
so
forth
i
start
by
saying
that
the
mater
is
most
deucedly
set
on
my
marrying
lady
maud
been
pals
all
our
lives
you
know
children
together
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
now
there
nobody
i
think
a
more
corking
sportsman
than
maud
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
this
is
where
the
catch
comes
in
i
most
frightfully
in
love
with
somebody
else
hopeless
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
still
there
it
is
and
all
the
while
the
mater
behind
me
with
a
bradawl
sicking
me
on
to
propose
to
maud
who
would
have
me
if
i
were
the
only
fellow
on
earth
you
ca
imagine
my
dear
old
chap
what
a
relief
it
was
to
both
of
us
when
she
told
me
the
other
day
that
she
was
in
love
with
you
and
would
dream
of
looking
at
anybody
else
i
tell
you
i
went
singing
about
the
place
george
felt
inclined
to
imitate
his
excellent
example
a
burst
of
song
was
the
only
adequate
expression
of
the
mood
of
heavenly
happiness
which
this
young
man
revelations
had
brought
upon
him
the
whole
world
seemed
different
wings
seemed
to
sprout
from
reggie
shapely
shoulders
the
air
was
filled
with
soft
music
even
the
wallpaper
seemed
moderately
attractive
he
mixed
himself
a
second
whisky
and
soda
it
was
the
next
best
thing
to
singing
i
see
he
said
it
was
difficult
to
say
anything
reggie
was
regarding
him
enviously
i
wish
i
knew
how
the
deuce
fellows
set
about
making
a
girl
fall
in
love
with
them
other
chappies
seem
to
do
it
but
i
ca
even
start
she
seems
to
sort
of
gaze
through
me
do
you
know
she
kind
of
looks
at
me
as
if
i
were
more
to
be
pitied
than
censured
but
as
if
she
thought
i
really
ought
to
do
something
about
it
of
course
she
a
devilish
brainy
girl
and
i
a
fearful
chump
makes
it
kind
of
hopeless
what
george
in
his
happiness
found
a
pleasure
in
encouraging
a
less
lucky
mortal
not
a
bit
what
you
ought
to
do
is
to
yes
said
reggie
eagerly
george
shook
his
head
no
i
do
know
he
said
nor
do
i
dash
it
said
reggie
george
pondered
it
seems
to
me
it
purely
a
question
of
luck
either
you
lucky
or
you
not
look
at
me
for
instance
what
is
there
about
me
to
make
a
wonderful
girl
love
me
nothing
i
see
what
you
mean
at
least
what
i
mean
to
say
is
no
you
were
right
the
first
time
it
all
a
question
of
luck
there
nothing
anyone
can
do
i
hang
about
a
good
deal
and
get
in
her
way
said
reggie
always
tripping
over
me
i
thought
that
might
help
a
bit
it
might
of
course
but
on
the
other
hand
when
we
do
meet
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
say
that
bad
deuced
funny
thing
i
not
what
you
call
a
silent
sort
of
chappie
by
nature
but
when
i
with
her
i
do
know
rum
he
drained
his
glass
and
rose
well
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
be
staggering
do
get
up
have
another
game
one
of
these
days
what
splendid
any
time
you
like
well
so
long
george
gave
himself
up
to
glowing
thoughts
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
seemed
to
be
vividly
aware
of
his
own
existence
it
was
as
if
he
were
some
thing
everything
around
him
and
everything
he
did
had
taken
on
a
strange
and
novel
interest
he
seemed
to
notice
the
ticking
of
the
clock
for
the
first
time
when
he
raised
his
glass
the
action
had
a
curious
air
of
newness
all
his
senses
were
oddly
alert
he
could
even
how
would
it
be
enquired
reggie
appearing
in
the
doorway
like
part
of
a
conjuring
trick
if
i
gave
her
a
flower
or
two
every
now
and
then
just
thought
of
it
as
i
was
starting
the
car
she
fond
of
flowers
fine
said
george
heartily
he
had
not
heard
a
word
the
alertness
of
sense
which
had
come
to
him
was
accompanied
by
a
strange
inability
to
attend
to
other
people
speech
this
would
no
doubt
pass
but
meanwhile
it
made
him
a
poor
listener
well
it
worth
trying
said
reggie
i
give
it
a
whirl
toodleoo
reggie
withdrew
and
presently
came
the
noise
of
the
car
starting
george
returned
to
his
thoughts
time
as
we
understand
it
ceases
to
exist
for
a
man
in
such
circumstances
whether
it
was
a
minute
later
or
several
hours
george
did
not
know
but
presently
he
was
aware
of
a
small
boy
standing
beside
him
a
boy
with
blue
eyes
who
wore
the
uniform
of
a
page
he
came
out
of
his
trance
this
he
recognized
was
the
boy
to
whom
he
had
given
the
note
for
maud
he
was
different
from
any
other
intruder
he
meant
something
in
george
scheme
of
things
said
the
youth
hullo
alphonso
said
george
my
name
not
alphonso
well
you
be
very
careful
or
it
soon
may
be
got
a
note
for
yer
from
lidy
mord
you
find
some
cake
and
in
the
kitchen
said
the
grateful
george
give
it
a
trial
not
said
the
stripling
chapter
george
opened
the
letter
with
trembling
and
reverent
fingers
dear
bevan
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
your
note
which
albert
gave
to
me
how
very
very
kind
hey
mister
george
looked
up
testily
the
boy
albert
had
reappeared
what
the
matter
ca
you
find
the
cake
i
found
the
kike
rejoined
albert
adducing
proof
of
the
statement
in
the
shape
of
a
massive
slice
from
which
he
took
a
substantial
bite
to
assist
thought
but
i
ca
find
the
ginger
ile
george
waved
him
away
this
interruption
at
such
a
moment
was
annoying
look
for
it
child
look
for
it
sniff
after
it
bay
on
its
trail
it
somewhere
about
wri
mumbled
albert
through
the
cake
he
flicked
a
crumb
off
his
cheek
with
a
tongue
which
would
have
excited
the
friendly
interest
of
an
i
like
well
go
and
bathe
in
it
wri
george
returned
to
his
letter
dear
bevan
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
your
note
which
albert
gave
to
me
how
very
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
like
this
and
to
say
hey
mister
good
heavens
george
glared
what
the
matter
now
have
you
found
that
yet
i
found
the
right
enough
but
i
ca
find
the
thing
the
thing
what
thing
the
thing
the
thing
wot
you
open
with
oh
you
mean
the
thing
it
in
the
middle
drawer
of
the
dresser
use
your
eyes
my
boy
wri
george
gave
an
overwrought
sigh
and
began
the
letter
again
dear
bevan
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
your
note
which
albert
gave
to
me
how
very
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
like
this
and
to
say
that
you
would
help
me
and
how
clever
of
you
to
find
me
after
i
was
so
secretive
that
day
in
the
cab
you
really
can
help
me
if
you
are
willing
it
too
long
to
explain
in
a
note
but
i
am
in
great
trouble
and
there
is
nobody
except
you
to
help
me
i
will
explain
everything
when
i
see
you
the
difficulty
will
be
to
slip
away
from
home
they
are
watching
me
every
moment
i
afraid
but
i
will
try
my
hardest
to
see
you
very
soon
yours
sincerely
maud
marsh
just
for
a
moment
it
must
be
confessed
the
tone
of
the
letter
damped
george
he
could
not
have
said
just
what
he
had
expected
but
certainly
reggie
revelations
had
prepared
him
for
something
rather
warmer
something
more
in
the
style
in
which
a
girl
would
write
to
the
man
she
loved
the
next
moment
however
he
saw
how
foolish
any
such
expectation
had
been
how
on
earth
could
any
reasonable
man
expect
a
girl
to
let
herself
go
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
it
was
for
him
to
make
the
first
move
naturally
she
was
going
to
reveal
her
feelings
until
he
had
revealed
his
george
raised
the
letter
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
vigorously
hey
mister
george
started
guiltily
the
blush
of
shame
overspread
his
cheeks
the
room
seemed
to
echo
with
the
sound
of
that
fatuous
kiss
kitty
kitty
kitty
he
called
snapping
his
fingers
and
repeating
the
incriminating
noise
i
was
just
calling
my
cat
he
explained
with
dignity
you
did
see
her
in
there
did
you
albert
blue
eyes
met
his
in
a
derisive
stare
the
lid
of
the
left
one
fluttered
it
was
but
too
plain
that
albert
was
not
convinced
a
little
black
cat
with
white
babbled
george
perseveringly
she
usually
either
here
or
there
or
or
somewhere
kitty
kitty
kitty
the
cupid
bow
of
albert
mouth
parted
he
uttered
one
word
swank
there
was
a
tense
silence
what
albert
was
thinking
one
can
not
say
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
what
george
was
thinking
was
that
the
late
king
herod
had
been
unjustly
blamed
for
a
policy
which
had
been
both
statesmanlike
and
in
the
interests
of
the
public
he
was
blaming
the
mawkish
sentimentality
of
the
modern
legal
system
which
ranks
the
evisceration
and
secret
burial
of
small
boys
as
a
crime
what
do
you
mean
you
know
what
i
mean
i
a
good
mind
to
albert
waved
a
deprecating
hand
it
all
right
mister
i
yer
friend
you
are
are
you
well
do
let
it
about
i
got
a
reputation
to
keep
up
i
yer
friend
i
tell
you
i
can
help
yer
i
want
to
help
yer
george
views
on
infanticide
underwent
a
slight
modification
after
all
he
felt
much
must
be
excused
to
youth
youth
thinks
it
funny
to
see
a
man
kissing
a
letter
it
is
not
funny
of
course
it
is
beautiful
but
it
no
good
arguing
the
point
let
youth
have
its
snigger
provided
after
it
has
finished
sniggering
it
intends
to
buckle
to
and
be
of
practical
assistance
albert
as
an
ally
was
not
to
be
despised
george
did
not
know
what
albert
duties
as
a
were
but
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
nature
that
gave
him
plenty
of
leisure
and
freedom
and
a
friendly
resident
of
the
castle
with
leisure
and
freedom
was
just
what
he
needed
that
very
good
of
you
he
said
twisting
his
reluctant
features
into
a
fairly
benevolent
smile
i
can
persisted
albert
got
a
cigaroot
do
you
smoke
child
when
i
get
of
a
cigaroot
i
do
i
sorry
i
ca
oblige
you
i
do
smoke
cigarettes
then
i
to
one
of
my
own
said
albert
moodily
he
reached
into
the
mysteries
of
his
pocket
and
produced
a
piece
of
string
a
knife
the
wishbone
of
a
fowl
two
marbles
a
crushed
cigarette
and
a
match
replacing
the
string
the
knife
the
wishbone
and
the
marbles
he
ignited
the
match
against
the
tightest
part
of
his
person
and
lit
the
cigarette
i
can
help
yer
i
know
the
ropes
and
smoke
them
said
george
wincing
pardon
nothing
albert
took
an
enjoyable
whiff
i
know
all
about
yer
you
do
you
and
lidy
mord
oh

do
do
you
i
was
listening
at
the
while
the
row
was
goin
on
there
was
a
row
was
there
a
faint
smile
of
retrospective
enjoyment
lit
up
albert
face
an
orful
row
shoutin
and
yellin
and
cussin
all
over
the
shop
about
you
and
lidy
maud
and
you
drank
it
in
eh
pardon
i
say
you
listened
not
i
listened
seeing
i
just
drawn
you
in
the
sweepstike
of
course
i
listened
not
george
did
not
follow
him
here
the
sweepstike
what
a
sweepstike
why
a
thing
you
puts
names
in
and
draw
and
the
one
that
gets
the
winning
name
wins
the
money
oh
you
mean
a
sweepstake
that
wot
i
said
a
sweepstike
george
was
still
puzzled
but
i
do
understand
how
do
you
mean
you
drew
me
in
a
sweepstike
i
mean
a
sweepstake
what
sweepstake
down
in
the
servants
keggs
the
butler
started
it
i
say
he
always
one
every
place
was
in
as
a
butler
leastways
whenever
there
was
any
dorters
of
the
always
a
chance
when
there
a
of
one
of
the
dorters
of
the
gettin
married
to
one
of
the
gents
in
the
party
so
keggs
puts
all
of
the
gents
names
in
an
and
you
pay
five
shillings
for
a
chance
and
the
one
that
draws
the
winning
name
gets
the
money
and
if
the
dorter
of
the
do
get
married
that
time
the
money
put
away
and
added
to
the
pool
for
the
next
george
gasped
this
revelation
of
life
below
stairs
in
the
stately
homes
of
england
took
his
breath
away
then
astonishment
gave
way
to
indignation
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
you
worms
made
lady
maud
the
the
prize
of
a
sweepstake
albert
was
hurt
who
yer
calling
worms
george
perceived
the
need
of
diplomacy
after
all
much
depended
on
this
child
goodwill
i
was
referring
to
the
butler
what
his
name
keggs
ai
a
worm
a
serpint
albert
drew
at
his
cigarette
his
brow
darkened
does
the
drawing
keggs
does
and
i
like
to
know
it
is
always
manages
to
cop
the
albert
chuckled
but
this
time
i
done
him
proper
did
want
me
in
the
thing
at
all

but
when
keggs
put

two
together
and
thought
of
one
or
two
things
that
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
said
it
was
a
swindle
and
wanted
the
drawin
done
over

but
the
others

one

offered

bob
slap
out
for

ticket
but
i
stuck
to
it
i
did
and
that
concluded
albert
throwing
the
cigarette
into
the
just
in
time
to
prevent
a
scorched
finger
why
i
going
to
yer
there
is
probably
no
attitude
of
mind
harder
for
the
average
man
to
maintain
than
that
of
aloof
disapproval
george
was
an
average
man
and
during
the
degrading
recital
just
concluded
he
had
found
himself
slipping
at
first
he
had
been
revolted
then
in
spite
of
himself
amused
and
now
when
all
the
facts
were
before
him
he
could
induce
his
mind
to
think
of
nothing
else
than
his
good
fortune
in
securing
as
an
ally
one
who
appeared
to
combine
a
precocious
intelligence
with
a
helpful
lack
of
scruple
war
is
war
and
love
is
love
and
in
each
the
practical
man
inclines
to
demand
from
his
the
punch
rather
than
a
lofty
soul
a
page
boy
replete
with
the
finer
feelings
would
have
been
useless
in
this
crisis
albert
who
seemed
on
the
evidence
of
a
short
but
sufficient
acquaintance
to
be
a
lad
who
would
not
recognize
the
finer
feelings
if
they
were
handed
to
him
on
a
plate
with
watercress
round
them
promised
to
be
invaluable
something
in
his
manner
told
george
that
the
child
was
bursting
with
schemes
for
his
benefit
have
some
more
cake
albert
he
said
ingratiatingly
the
boy
shook
his
head
do
urged
george
just
a
little
slice
there
ai
no
little
slice
replied
albert
with
regret
i
ate
it
all
he
sighed
and
resumed
i
got
ta
scheme
fine
what
is
it
albert
knitted
his
brows
it
like
this
you
want
to
see
lidyship
but

the
head

sharp

cousin
that
an
awful
thing
to
ask
anyone
to
say
pardon
nothing
said
george
chapter
the
great
ball
in
honour
of
lord
belpher
was
at
its
height
the
reporter
of
the
belpher
intelligencer
and
guide
who
was
present
in
his
official
capacity
and
had
been
allowed
by
butler
keggs
to
take
a
peep
at
the
scene
through
a
justly
observed
in
his
account
of
the
proceedings
next
day
that
the
ensemble
was
fairylike
and
described
the
company
as
galaxy
of
fair
women
and
brave
men
the
floor
was
crowded
with
all
that
was
best
and
noblest
in
the
county
so
that
a
hurled
at
any
given
moment
must
infallibly
have
spilt
blue
blood
peers
stepped
on
the
toes
of
knights
honorables
bumped
into
the
spines
of
baronets
probably
the
only
titled
person
in
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
country
who
was
not
playing
his
part
in
the
glittering
scene
was
lord
marshmoreton
who
on
discovering
that
his
private
study
had
been
converted
into
a
cloakroom
had
retired
to
bed
with
a
pipe
and
a
copy
of
roses
red
and
roses
white
by
emily
ann
mackintosh
popgood
crooly
which
he
was
to
discover
after
he
was
between
the
sheets
and
it
was
too
late
to
repair
the
error
was
not
as
he
had
supposed
a
treatise
on
his
favourite
hobby
but
a
novel
of
stearine
sentimentality
dealing
with
the
adventures
of
a
pure
young
english
girl
and
an
artist
named
claude
george
from
the
shaded
seclusion
of
a
gallery
looked
down
upon
the
brilliant
throng
with
impatience
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
doing
this
all
his
life
the
novelty
of
the
experience
had
long
since
ceased
to
divert
him
it
was
all
just
like
the
second
act
of
an
musical
comedy
act
two
the
ballroom
grantchester
towers
one
week
later
a
resemblance
which
was
heightened
for
him
by
the
fact
that
the
band
had
more
than
once
played
dead
and
buried
melodies
of
his
own
composition
of
which
he
had
wearied
a
full
eighteen
months
back
a
complete
absence
of
obstacles
had
attended
his
intrusion
into
the
castle
a
brief
interview
with
a
motherly
old
lady
whom
even
albert
seemed
to
treat
with
respect
and
who
it
appeared
was
digby
the
followed
by
an
even
briefer
encounter
with
keggs
fussy
and
irritable
with
responsibility
and
even
while
talking
to
george
carrying
on
two
other
conversations
on
topics
of
the
moment
and
he
was
past
the
censors
and
free
for
one
night
only
to
add
his
presence
to
the
chosen
inside
the
walls
of
belpher
his
duties
were
to
stand
in
this
gallery
and
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
the
maids
to
minister
to
the
comfort
of
such
of
the
dancers
as
should
use
it
as
a
place
none
had
so
far
made
their
appearance
the
superior
attractions
of
the
main
floor
having
exercised
a
great
appeal
and
for
the
past
hour
george
had
been
alone
with
the
maid
and
his
thoughts
the
maid
having
asked
george
if
he
knew
her
cousin
frank
who
had
been
in
america
nearly
a
year
and
having
received
a
reply
in
the
negative
seemed
to
be
disappointed
in
him
and
to
lose
interest
and
had
not
spoken
for
twenty
minutes
george
scanned
the
approaches
to
the
balcony
for
a
sight
of
albert
as
the
shipwrecked
mariner
scans
the
horizon
for
the
passing
sail
it
was
inevitable
he
supposed
this
waiting
it
would
be
difficult
for
maud
to
slip
away
even
for
a
moment
on
such
a
night
i
say
laddie
would
you
mind
getting
me
a
lemonade
george
was
gazing
over
the
balcony
when
the
voice
spoke
behind
him
and
the
muscles
of
his
back
stiffened
as
he
recognized
its
genial
note
this
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
prepared
himself
for
but
now
that
it
had
happened
he
felt
a
wave
of
such
as
he
had
only
once
experienced
before
in
his
life
on
the
occasion
when
he
had
been
young
enough
and
inexperienced
enough
to
take
a
on
a
first
night
reggie
byng
was
friendly
and
would
not
wilfully
betray
him
but
reggie
was
also
a
babbler
who
could
not
be
trusted
to
keep
things
to
himself
it
was
necessary
he
perceived
to
take
a
strong
line
from
the
start
and
convince
reggie
that
any
likeness
which
the
latter
might
suppose
that
he
detected
between
his
companion
of
that
afternoon
and
the
waiter
of
tonight
existed
only
in
his
heated
imagination
as
george
turned
reggie
pleasant
face
pink
with
healthful
exercise
and
lord
marshmoreton
finest
bollinger
lost
most
of
its
colour
his
eyes
and
mouth
opened
wider
the
fact
is
reggie
was
shaken
all
through
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
he
had
been
sedulously
priming
himself
with
stimulants
with
a
view
to
amassing
enough
nerve
to
propose
to
alice
faraday
and
now
that
he
had
drawn
her
away
from
the
throng
to
this
secluded
nook
and
was
about
to
put
his
fortune
to
the
test
a
horrible
fear
swept
over
him
that
he
had
overdone
it
he
was
having
optical
illusions
good
god
reggie
loosened
his
collar
and
pulled
himself
together
would
you
mind
taking
a
glass
of
lemonade
to
the
lady
in
blue
sitting
on
the
settee
over
there
by
the
statue
he
said
carefully
he
brightened
up
a
little
pretty
good
that
not
absolutely
a
test
sentence
perhaps
like
rural
or
intricacies
of
the
british
constitution
but
nevertheless
no
mean
feat
i
say
he
continued
after
a
pause
sir
you
have
ever
seen
me
before
by
any
chance
if
you
know
what
i
mean
have
you
no
sir
you
have
a
brother
or
anything
of
that
shape
or
order
have
you
no
no
sir
i
have
often
wished
i
had
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
father
about
it
father
could
never
deny
me
anything
reggie
blinked
his
misgiving
returned
either
his
ears
like
his
eyes
were
playing
him
tricks
or
else
this
was
talking
pure
drivel
what
that
sir
what
did
you
say
i
said
sir
i
have
no
brother
did
you
say
something
else
no
sir
what
no
sir
reggie
worst
suspicions
were
confirmed
good
god
he
muttered
then
i
am
miss
faraday
when
he
joined
her
on
the
settee
wanted
an
explanation
what
were
you
talking
to
that
man
about
byng
you
seemed
to
be
having
a
very
interesting
conversation
i
was
asking
him
if
he
had
a
brother
miss
faraday
glanced
quickly
at
him
she
had
had
a
feeling
for
some
time
during
the
evening
that
his
manner
had
been
strange
a
brother
what
made
you
ask
him
that
he
i
mean
that
is
to
say
what
i
mean
is
he
looked
the
sort
of
chap
who
might
have
a
brother
lots
of
those
fellows
have
alice
faraday
face
took
on
a
motherly
look
she
was
fonder
of
reggie
than
that
youth
supposed
and
by
sheer
accident
he
had
stumbled
on
the
right
road
to
her
consideration
alice
faraday
was
one
of
those
girls
whose
dream
it
is
to
be
a
ministering
angel
to
some
chosen
man
to
be
a
good
influence
to
him
and
raise
him
to
an
appreciation
of
nobler
things
hitherto
reggie
personality
had
seemed
to
her
agreeable
but
negative
a
positive
vice
like
in
alcohol
altered
him
completely
it
gave
him
a
significance
i
told
him
to
get
you
a
lemonade
said
reggie
he
seems
to
be
taking
his
time
about
it
hi
george
approached
deferentially
sir
where
that
lemonade
lemonade
sir
did
i
ask
you
to
bring
this
lady
a
glass
of
lemonade
i
did
not
understand
you
to
do
so
sir
but
great
scott
what
were
we
chatting
about
then
you
were
telling
me
a
diverting
story
about
an
irishman
who
landed
in
new
york
looking
for
work
sir
you
would
like
a
glass
of
lemonade
sir
very
good
sir
alice
placed
a
hand
gently
on
reggie
arm
do
you
think
you
had
better
lie
down
for
a
little
and
rest
byng
i
sure
it
would
do
you
good
the
solicitous
note
in
her
voice
made
reggie
quiver
like
a
jelly
he
had
never
known
her
speak
like
that
before
for
a
moment
he
was
inclined
to
lay
bare
his
soul
but
his
nerve
was
broken
he
did
not
want
her
to
mistake
the
outpouring
of
a
strong
man
heart
for
the
irresponsible
ravings
of
a
too
hearty
diner
it
was
one
of
ironies
here
he
was
for
the
first
time
all
keyed
up
to
go
right
ahead
and
he
could
do
it
it
the
heat
of
the
room
said
alice
shall
we
go
and
sit
outside
on
the
terrace
never
mind
about
the
lemonade
i
not
really
thirsty
reggie
followed
her
like
a
lamb
the
prospect
of
the
cool
night
air
was
grateful
that
murmured
george
as
he
watched
them
depart
ought
to
hold
you
for
a
while
he
perceived
albert
hastening
towards
him
chapter
albert
was
in
a
hurry
he
skimmed
over
the
carpet
like
a
quick
he
said
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
maid
george
she
was
reading
a
novelette
with
her
back
turned
tell
you
be
back
in
five
minutes
said
albert
jerking
a
thumb
unnecessary
she
wo
notice
my
absence
ever
since
she
discovered
that
i
had
never
met
her
cousin
frank
in
america
i
have
meant
nothing
in
her
life
then
come
on
where
i
show
you
that
it
was
not
the
nearest
and
most
direct
route
which
they
took
to
the
george
became
aware
after
he
had
followed
his
young
guide
through
doors
and
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
and
had
at
last
come
to
a
halt
in
a
room
to
which
the
sound
of
the
music
penetrated
but
faintly
he
recognized
the
room
he
had
been
in
it
before
it
was
the
same
room
where
he
and
billie
dore
had
listened
to
keggs
telling
the
story
of
lord
leonard
and
his
leap
that
window
there
he
remembered
now
opened
on
to
the
very
balcony
from
which
the
historic
leonard
had
done
his
spectacular
dive
that
it
should
be
the
scene
of
this
other
secret
meeting
struck
george
as
appropriate
the
coincidence
appealed
to
him
albert
vanished
george
took
a
deep
breath
now
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
which
he
had
waited
so
long
he
was
aware
of
a
return
of
that
feeling
of
which
had
come
upon
him
when
he
heard
reggie
byng
voice
this
sort
of
thing
it
must
be
remembered
was
not
in
george
usual
line
his
had
been
a
quiet
and
uneventful
life
and
the
only
exciting
thing
which
in
his
recollection
had
ever
happened
to
him
previous
to
the
dramatic
entry
of
lady
maud
into
his
that
day
in
piccadilly
had
occurred
at
college
nearly
ten
years
before
when
a
festive
no
doubt
with
the
best
motives
had
placed
a
mexican
horned
toad
in
his
bed
on
the
night
of
the
yale
football
game
a
light
footstep
sounded
outside
and
the
room
whirled
round
george
in
a
manner
which
if
it
had
happened
to
reggie
byng
would
have
caused
that
injudicious
drinker
to
abandon
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
when
the
furniture
had
returned
to
its
place
and
the
rug
had
ceased
to
spin
maud
was
standing
before
him
nothing
is
harder
to
remember
than
a
face
it
had
caused
george
a
good
deal
of
distress
and
inconvenience
that
try
as
he
might
he
could
not
conjure
up
anything
more
than
a
vague
vision
of
what
the
only
girl
in
the
world
really
looked
like
he
had
carried
away
with
him
from
their
meeting
in
the
cab
only
a
confused
recollection
of
eyes
that
shone
and
a
mouth
that
curved
in
a
smile
and
the
brief
moment
in
which
he
was
able
to
refresh
his
memory
when
he
found
her
in
the
lane
with
reggie
byng
and
the
car
had
not
been
enough
to
add
definiteness
the
consequence
was
that
maud
came
upon
him
now
with
the
stunning
effect
of
beauty
seen
for
the
first
time
he
gasped
in
that
dazzling
with
the
flush
of
dancing
on
her
cheeks
and
the
light
of
dancing
in
her
eyes
she
was
so
much
more
wonderful
than
any
picture
of
her
which
memory
had
been
able
to
produce
for
his
inspection
that
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
seen
her
before
even
her
brother
percy
a
stern
critic
where
his
nearest
and
dearest
were
concerned
had
admitted
on
meeting
her
in
the
before
dinner
that
that
particular
dress
suited
maud
it
was
a
shimmering
of
and
that
at
least
was
how
it
struck
george
a
dressmaker
would
have
found
a
longer
and
less
romantic
description
for
it
but
that
does
not
matter
whoever
wishes
for
a
cold
and
technical
catalogue
of
the
stuffs
which
went
to
make
up
the
picture
that
deprived
george
of
speech
may
consult
the
files
of
the
belpher
intelligencer
and
farmers
guide
and
read
the
report
of
the
editor
wife
who
does
the
dresses
for
the
intelligencer
under
the
of
birdie
as
far
as
george
was
concerned
the
thing
was
made
of
and
george
as
i
say
was
deprived
of
speech
that
any
girl
could
possibly
look
so
beautiful
was
enough
to
paralyse
his
faculties
but
that
this
ethereal
being
straight
from
fairyland
could
have
stooped
to
love
him
him
an
earthy
brute
who
wore
and
drank
coffee
for
breakfast
that
was
what
robbed
george
of
the
power
to
articulate
he
could
do
nothing
but
look
at
her
from
the
hills
of
fairyland
soft
music
came
or
if
we
must
be
exact
maud
spoke
i
could
get
away
before
then
she
stopped
short
and
darted
to
the
door
listening
was
that
somebody
coming
i
had
to
cut
a
dance
with
plummer
to
get
here
and
i
so
afraid
he
may
he
had
a
moment
later
it
was
only
too
evident
that
this
was
precisely
what
plummer
had
done
there
was
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
a
heavy
footstep
this
time
and
from
outside
the
voice
of
the
pursuer
made
itself
heard
oh
there
you
are
lady
maud
i
was
looking
for
you
this
is
our
dance
george
did
not
know
who
plummer
was
he
did
not
want
to
know
his
only
thought
regarding
plummer
was
a
passionate
realization
of
the
superfluity
of
his
existence
it
is
the
presence
on
the
globe
of
these
plummers
that
delays
the
coming
of
the
millennium
his
stunned
mind
leaped
into
sudden
activity
he
must
not
be
found
here
that
was
certain
waiters
who
ramble
at
large
about
a
feudal
castle
and
are
discovered
in
conversation
with
the
daughter
of
the
house
excite
comment
and
conversely
daughters
of
the
house
who
talk
in
secluded
rooms
with
waiters
also
find
explanations
necessary
he
must
withdraw
he
must
withdraw
quickly
and
as
a
gesture
from
maud
indicated
the
withdrawal
must
be
effected
through
the
french
window
opening
on
the
balcony
estimating
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
approaching
plummer
at
three
stairs
the
voice
had
come
from
below
and
a
landing
the
space
of
time
allotted
to
him
by
a
hustling
fate
for
disappearing
was
some
four
seconds
inside
two
and
half
the
french
window
had
opened
and
closed
and
george
was
out
under
the
stars
with
the
cool
winds
of
the
night
playing
on
his
heated
forehead
he
had
now
time
for
meditation
there
are
few
situations
which
provide
more
scope
for
meditation
than
that
of
the
man
penned
up
on
a
small
balcony
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ground
with
his
only
avenue
of
retreat
cut
off
behind
him
so
george
meditated
first
he
mused
on
plummer
he
thought
some
hard
thoughts
about
plummer
then
he
brooded
on
the
unkindness
of
a
fortune
which
had
granted
him
the
opportunity
of
this
meeting
with
maud
only
to
snatch
it
away
almost
before
it
had
begun
he
wondered
how
long
the
late
lord
leonard
had
been
permitted
to
talk
on
that
occasion
before
he
too
had
had
to
retire
through
these
same
windows
there
was
no
doubt
about
one
thing
lovers
who
chose
that
room
for
their
interviews
seemed
to
have
very
little
luck
it
had
not
occurred
to
george
at
first
that
there
could
be
any
further
disadvantage
attached
to
his
position
other
than
the
obvious
drawbacks
which
had
already
come
to
his
notice
he
was
now
to
perceive
that
he
had
been
mistaken
a
voice
was
speaking
in
the
room
he
had
left
a
plainly
audible
voice
deep
and
throaty
and
within
a
minute
george
had
become
aware
that
he
was
to
suffer
the
additional
discomfort
of
being
obliged
to
listen
to
a
fellow
man
one
could
call
plummer
that
by
stretching
the
facts
a
little
proposing
marriage
the
gruesomeness
of
the
situation
became
intensified
of
all
moments
when
a
man
and
justice
compelled
george
to
admit
that
plummer
was
technically
human
of
all
moments
when
a
man
may
by
all
the
laws
of
decency
demand
to
be
alone
without
an
audience
of
his
own
sex
the
chiefest
is
the
moment
when
he
is
asking
a
girl
to
marry
him
george
was
a
sensitive
nature
and
he
writhed
at
the
thought
of
playing
the
eavesdropper
at
such
a
time
he
looked
frantically
about
him
for
a
means
of
escape
plummer
had
now
reached
the
stage
of
saying
at
great
length
that
he
was
not
worthy
of
maud
he
said
it
over
and
over
again
in
different
ways
george
was
in
hearty
agreement
with
him
but
he
did
not
want
to
hear
it
he
wanted
to
get
away
but
how
lord
leonard
on
a
similar
occasion
had
leaped
some
might
argue
therefore
on
the
principle
that
what
man
has
done
man
can
do
that
george
should
have
imitated
him
but
men
differ
there
was
a
man
attached
to
a
circus
who
used
to
dive
off
the
roof
of
madison
square
garden
on
to
a
sloping
board
strike
it
with
his
chest
turn
a
couple
of
somersaults
reach
the
ground
bow
six
times
and
go
off
to
lunch
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
gift
some
of
us
have
it
some
have
not
george
had
not
painful
as
it
was
to
hear
plummer
floundering
through
his
proposal
of
marriage
instinct
told
him
that
it
would
be
far
more
painful
to
hurl
himself
out
into
on
the
sporting
chance
of
having
his
downward
progress
arrested
by
the
branches
of
the
big
tree
that
had
upheld
lord
leonard
no
there
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
remain
where
he
was
inside
the
room
plummer
was
now
saying
how
much
the
marriage
would
please
his
mother
psst
george
looked
about
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
heard
a
voice
he
listened
no
except
for
the
barking
of
a
distant
dog
the
faint
wailing
of
a
waltz
the
rustle
of
a
roosting
bird
and
the
sound
of
plummer
saying
that
if
her
refusal
was
due
to
anything
she
might
have
heard
about
that
case
of
his
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
would
like
to
state
that
he
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
that
the
girl
had
absolutely
misunderstood
him
all
was
still
psst
hey
mister
it
was
a
voice
it
came
from
above
was
it
an
angel
voice
not
altogether
it
was
albert
the
boy
was
leaning
out
of
a
window
some
six
feet
higher
up
the
castle
wall
george
his
eyes
by
now
grown
used
to
the
darkness
perceived
that
the
stripling
gesticulated
as
one
having
some
message
to
impart
then
glancing
to
one
side
he
saw
what
looked
like
some
kind
of
a
rope
swayed
against
the
wall
he
reached
for
it
the
thing
was
not
a
rope
it
was
a
knotted
sheet
from
above
came
albert
hoarse
whisper
look
alive
this
was
precisely
what
george
wanted
to
do
for
at
least
another
fifty
years
or
so
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
stood
there
in
the
starlight
gingerly
fingering
this
flimsy
linen
thing
that
if
he
were
to
suspend
his
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
bone
and
sinew
at
the
end
of
it
over
the
black
gulf
outside
the
balcony
he
would
look
alive
for
about
five
seconds
and
after
that
goodness
only
knew
how
he
would
look
he
knew
all
about
knotted
sheets
he
had
read
a
hundred
stories
in
which
heroes
heroines
low
comedy
friends
and
even
villains
did
all
sorts
of
reckless
things
with
their
assistance
there
was
not
much
comfort
to
be
derived
from
that
it
was
one
thing
to
read
about
people
doing
silly
things
like
that
quite
another
to
do
them
yourself
he
gave
albert
sheet
a
tentative
shake
in
all
his
experience
he
thought
he
had
never
come
across
anything
so
supremely
unstable
one
calls
it
albert
sheet
for
the
sake
of
convenience
it
was
really
reggie
byng
sheet
and
when
reggie
got
to
his
room
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
and
found
the
thing
a
mass
of
knots
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
being
a
young
man
that
his
bosom
friend
jack
ferris
who
had
come
up
from
london
to
see
lord
belpher
through
the
trying
experience
of
a
party
had
done
it
as
a
practical
joke
and
went
and
poured
a
jug
of
water
over
jack
bed
that
is
life
just
one
long
succession
of
misunderstandings
and
rash
acts
and
what
not
absolutely
albert
was
becoming
impatient
he
was
in
the
position
of
a
great
general
who
thinks
out
some
wonderful
piece
of
strategy
and
get
his
army
to
carry
it
out
many
boys
seeing
plummer
enter
the
room
below
and
listening
at
the
keyhole
and
realizing
that
george
must
have
hidden
somewhere
and
deducing
that
he
must
be
out
on
the
balcony
would
have
been
baffled
as
to
how
to
proceed
not
so
albert
to
dash
up
to
reggie
byng
room
and
strip
his
sheet
off
the
bed
and
tie
it
to
the
and
fashion
a
series
of
knots
in
it
and
lower
it
out
of
the
window
took
albert
about
three
minutes
his
part
in
the
business
had
been
performed
without
a
hitch
and
now
george
who
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
the
childish
task
of
climbing
up
the
sheet
was
jeopardizing
the
success
of
the
whole
scheme
by
delay
albert
gave
the
sheet
an
irritable
jerk
it
was
the
worst
thing
he
could
have
done
george
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
take
a
chance
when
the
sheet
was
snatched
from
his
grasp
as
if
it
had
been
some
live
thing
deliberately
eluding
his
clutch
the
thought
of
what
would
have
happened
had
this
occurred
when
he
was
in
caused
him
to
break
out
in
a
cold
perspiration
he
retired
a
pace
and
perched
himself
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
psst
said
albert
it
no
good
saying
rejoined
george
in
an
annoyed
undertone
i
could
say
any
fool
could
say
albert
he
considered
in
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
saying
psst
was
merely
touching
the
fringe
of
the
subject
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
remained
seated
on
the
balcony
rail
regarding
the
sheet
with
cold
aversion
indefinitely
had
not
his
hand
been
forced
by
the
man
plummer
plummer
during
these
last
minutes
had
shot
his
bolt
he
had
said
everything
that
a
man
could
say
much
of
it
twice
over
and
now
he
was
through
all
was
ended
the
verdict
was
in
no
for
plummer
i
think
said
plummer
gloomily
and
the
words
smote
on
ear
like
a
knell
i
think
i
like
a
little
air
george
leaped
from
his
rail
like
a
hunted
grasshopper
if
plummer
was
looking
for
air
it
meant
that
he
was
going
to
come
out
on
the
balcony
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
it
probably
meant
the
abrupt
conclusion
of
a
promising
career
but
he
could
hesitate
no
longer
george
grasped
the
sheet
it
felt
like
a
rope
of
cobwebs
and
swung
himself
out
maud
looked
out
on
to
the
balcony
her
heart
which
had
stood
still
when
the
rejected
one
opened
the
window
and
stepped
forth
to
commune
with
the
soothing
stars
beat
again
there
was
no
one
there
only
emptiness
and
plummer
this
said
plummer
sombrely
gazing
over
the
rail
into
the
darkness
is
the
place
where
that
fellow
jumped
off
in
the
reign
of
thingummy
is
it
maud
understood
now
and
a
thrill
of
the
purest
admiration
for
george
heroism
swept
over
her
so
rather
than
compromise
her
he
had
done
leonard
leap
how
splendid
of
him
if
george
now
sitting
on
reggie
byng
bed
taking
a
rueful
census
of
the
bits
of
skin
remaining
on
his
hands
and
knees
after
his
climb
could
have
read
her
thoughts
he
would
have
felt
well
rewarded
for
his
abrasions
i
a
jolly
good
mind
said
plummer
to
do
it
myself
he
uttered
a
short
mirthless
laugh
well
anyway
he
said
recklessly
i
jolly
well
go
downstairs
and
have
a
albert
finished
untying
the
sheet
from
the
bedpost
and
stuffed
it
under
the
pillow
and
now
said
albert
for
a
quiet
smoke
in
the
scullery
these
massive
minds
require
their
moments
of
relaxation
chapter
george
idea
was
to
get
home
quick
there
was
no
possible
chance
of
a
second
meeting
with
maud
that
night
they
had
met
and
had
been
whirled
asunder
no
use
to
struggle
with
fate
best
to
give
in
and
hope
that
another
time
fate
would
be
kinder
what
george
wanted
now
was
to
be
away
from
all
the
gay
glitter
and
the
fairylike
tout
ensemble
and
the
galaxy
of
fair
women
and
brave
men
safe
in
his
own
where
nothing
could
happen
to
him
a
nice
sense
of
duty
would
no
doubt
have
taken
him
back
to
his
post
in
order
fully
to
earn
the
sovereign
which
had
been
paid
to
him
for
his
services
as
temporary
waiter
but
the
voice
of
duty
called
to
him
in
vain
if
the
british
aristocracy
desired
refreshments
let
them
get
them
for
themselves
and
like
it
he
was
through
but
if
george
had
for
the
time
being
done
with
the
british
aristocracy
the
british
aristocracy
had
not
done
with
him
hardly
had
he
reached
the
hall
when
he
encountered
the
one
member
of
the
order
whom
he
would
most
gladly
have
avoided
lord
belpher
was
not
in
genial
mood
late
hours
always
made
his
head
ache
and
he
was
not
a
dancing
man
so
that
he
was
by
now
fully
as
weary
of
the
fairylike
tout
ensemble
as
was
george
but
being
the
centre
and
cause
of
the
night
proceedings
he
was
compelled
to
be
present
to
the
finish
he
was
in
the
position
of
captains
who
must
be
last
to
leave
their
ships
and
of
boys
who
stand
on
burning
decks
whence
all
but
they
had
fled
he
had
spent
several
hours
shaking
hands
with
total
strangers
and
receiving
with
a
frozen
smile
their
felicitations
on
the
attainment
of
his
majority
and
he
could
not
have
been
called
upon
to
meet
a
larger
horde
of
relations
than
had
surged
round
him
that
night
if
he
had
been
a
rabbit
the
belpher
connection
was
wide
straggling
over
most
of
england
and
first
cousins
second
cousins
and
even
third
and
fourth
cousins
had
debouched
from
practically
every
county
on
the
map
and
marched
upon
the
home
of
their
ancestors
the
effort
of
having
to
be
civil
to
all
of
these
had
told
upon
percy
like
the
heroine
of
his
sister
maud
favourite
poem
he
was
aweary
aweary
and
he
wanted
a
drink
he
regarded
george
appearance
as
exceedingly
opportune
get
me
a
small
bottle
of
champagne
and
bring
it
to
the
library
yes
sir
the
two
words
sound
innocent
enough
but
wishing
as
he
did
to
efface
himself
and
avoid
publicity
they
were
the
most
unfortunate
which
george
could
have
chosen
if
he
had
merely
bowed
acquiescence
and
departed
it
is
probable
that
lord
belpher
would
not
have
taken
a
second
look
at
him
percy
was
in
no
condition
to
subject
everyone
he
met
to
a
minute
scrutiny
but
when
you
have
been
addressed
for
an
entire
lifetime
as
your
lordship
it
startles
you
when
a
waiter
calls
you
sir
lord
belpher
gave
george
a
glance
in
which
reproof
and
pain
were
nicely
mingled
emotions
quickly
supplanted
by
amazement
a
gurgle
escaped
him
stop
he
cried
as
george
turned
away
percy
was
rattled
the
crisis
found
him
in
two
minds
on
the
one
hand
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
take
oath
that
this
man
before
him
was
the
man
who
had
knocked
off
his
hat
in
piccadilly
the
likeness
had
struck
him
like
a
blow
the
moment
he
had
taken
a
good
look
at
the
fellow
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
which
is
more
likely
to
lead
one
astray
than
a
resemblance
he
had
never
forgotten
the
horror
and
humiliation
of
the
occasion
which
had
happened
in
his
fourteenth
year
when
a
motherly
woman
at
paddington
station
had
called
him
dearie
and
publicly
embraced
him
on
the
erroneous
supposition
that
he
was
her
nephew
philip
he
must
proceed
cautiously
a
brawl
with
an
innocent
waiter
coming
on
the
heels
of
that
infernal
episode
with
the
policeman
would
give
people
the
impression
that
assailing
the
lower
orders
had
become
a
hobby
of
his
sir
said
george
politely
his
brazen
front
shook
lord
belpher
confidence
i
have
seen
you
before
here
have
i
was
all
he
could
find
to
say
no
sir
replied
george
smoothly
i
am
only
temporarily
attached
to
the
castle
staff
where
do
you
come
from
america
sir
lord
belpher
started
america
yes
sir
i
am
in
england
on
a
vacation
my
cousin
albert
is
page
boy
at
the
castle
and
he
told
me
there
were
a
few
vacancies
for
extra
help
tonight
so
i
applied
and
was
given
the
job
lord
belpher
frowned
perplexedly
it
all
sounded
entirely
plausible
and
what
was
satisfactory
the
statement
could
be
checked
by
application
to
keggs
the
butler
and
yet
there
was
a
lingering
doubt
however
there
seemed
nothing
to
be
gained
by
continuing
the
conversation
i
see
he
said
at
last
well
bring
that
champagne
to
the
library
as
quick
as
you
can
very
good
sir
lord
belpher
remained
where
he
stood
brooding
reason
told
him
he
ought
to
be
satisfied
but
he
was
not
satisfied
it
would
have
been
different
had
he
not
known
that
this
fellow
with
whom
maud
had
become
entangled
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
if
that
scoundrel
had
had
the
audacity
to
come
and
take
a
cottage
at
the
castle
gates
why
not
the
audacity
to
invade
the
castle
itself
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
footmen
on
his
way
through
the
hall
with
a
tray
gave
him
the
opportunity
for
further
investigation
send
keggs
to
me
very
good
your
lordship
an
interval
and
the
butler
arrived
unlike
lord
belpher
late
hours
were
no
hardship
to
keggs
he
was
essentially
a
flower
his
brow
was
as
free
from
wrinkles
as
his
he
bore
himself
with
the
conscious
dignity
of
one
who
while
he
would
have
freely
admitted
he
did
not
actually
own
the
castle
was
nevertheless
aware
that
he
was
one
of
its
most
conspicuous
ornaments
you
wished
to
see
me
your
lordship
yes
keggs
there
are
a
number
of
outside
men
helping
here
tonight
are
there
indubitably
your
lordship
the
unprecedented
scale
of
the
entertainment
necessitated
the
engagement
of
a
certain
number
of
supernumeraries
replied
keggs
with
an
easy
fluency
which
reggie
byng
now
cooling
his
head
on
the
lower
terrace
would
have
bitterly
envied
in
the
circumstances
such
an
arrangement
was
inevitable
you
engaged
all
these
men
yourself
in
a
manner
of
speaking
your
lordship
and
for
all
practical
purposes
yes
digby
the
conducted
the
actual
negotiations
in
many
cases
but
the
arrangement
was
in
no
instance
considered
complete
until
i
had
passed
each
applicant
do
you
know
anything
of
an
american
who
says
he
is
the
cousin
of
the
the
boy
albert
did
introduce
a
nominee
whom
he
stated
to
be
cousin
from
new
york
on
a
visit
and
anxious
to
oblige
i
trust
he
given
no
dissatisfaction
your
lordship
he
seemed
a
respectable
young
man
no
no
not
at
all
i
merely
wished
to
know
if
you
knew
him
one
ca
be
too
careful
no
indeed
your
lordship
that
all
then
thank
you
your
lordship
lord
belpher
was
satisfied
he
was
also
relieved
he
felt
that
prudence
and
a
steady
head
had
kept
him
from
making
himself
ridiculous
when
george
presently
returned
with
the
fluid
he
thanked
him
and
turned
his
thoughts
to
other
things
but
if
the
young
master
was
satisfied
keggs
was
not
upon
keggs
a
bright
light
had
shone
there
were
few
men
he
flattered
himself
who
could
more
readily
put
two
and
two
together
and
bring
the
sum
to
a
correct
answer
keggs
knew
of
the
strange
american
gentleman
who
had
taken
up
his
abode
at
the
cottage
down
by
platt
farm
his
looks
his
habits
and
his
motives
for
coming
there
had
formed
food
for
discussion
throughout
one
meal
in
the
servant
hall
a
stranger
whose
abstention
from
brush
and
palette
showed
him
to
be
no
artist
being
an
object
of
interest
and
while
the
solution
put
forward
by
a
romantic
a
great
reader
of
novelettes
that
the
young
man
had
come
there
to
cure
himself
of
some
unhappy
passion
by
communing
with
nature
had
been
scoffed
at
by
the
company
keggs
had
not
been
so
sure
that
there
might
not
be
something
in
it
later
events
had
deepened
his
suspicion
which
now
after
this
interview
with
lord
belpher
had
become
certainty
the
extreme
fishiness
of
albert
sudden
production
of
a
cousin
from
america
was
so
manifest
that
only
his
preoccupation
at
the
moment
when
he
met
the
young
man
could
have
prevented
him
seeing
it
before
his
knowledge
of
albert
told
him
that
if
one
so
versed
as
that
youth
in
the
art
of
swank
had
really
possessed
a
cousin
in
america
he
would
long
ago
have
been
boring
the
servants
hall
with
fictions
about
the
man
wealth
and
importance
for
albert
not
to
lie
about
a
thing
practically
proved
that
thing
such
was
the
simple
creed
of
keggs
he
accosted
a
passing
seen
young
blighted
albert
anywhere
freddy
it
was
in
this
shameful
manner
that
that
mastermind
was
habitually
referred
to
below
stairs
seen
going
into
the
scullery
not
a
minute
ago
replied
freddy
thanks
so
long
said
freddy
be
good
returned
keggs
whose
mode
of
speech
among
those
of
his
own
world
differed
substantially
from
that
which
he
considered
it
became
him
to
employ
when
conversing
with
the
titled
the
fall
of
great
men
is
but
too
often
due
to
the
failure
of
their
miserable
bodies
to
give
the
necessary
support
to
their
great
brains
there
are
some
for
example
who
say
that
napoleon
would
have
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
if
he
had
not
had
dyspepsia
not
otherwise
was
it
with
albert
on
that
present
occasion
the
arrival
of
keggs
found
him
at
a
disadvantage
he
had
been
imprudent
enough
on
leaving
george
to
endeavour
to
smoke
a
cigar
purloined
from
the
box
which
stood
hospitably
open
on
a
table
in
the
hall
but
for
this
who
knows
with
what
cunning
he
might
have
foiled
the
butler
onslaught
as
it
was
the
battle
was
a
for
the
enemy
i
been
looking
for
you
young
blighted
albert
said
keggs
coldly
albert
turned
a
green
but
defiant
face
to
the
foe
go
and
boil
yer
he
advised
never
mind
about
my
if
i
was
to
do
my
duty
to
you
i
give
you
a
clip
side
of
your
that
what
i
do
and
then
bury
it
in
the
woods
added
albert
wincing
as
the
consequences
of
his
rash
act
swept
through
his
small
form
like
some
nauseous
tidal
wave
he
shut
his
eyes
it
upset
him
to
see
keggs
shimmering
like
that
a
shimmering
butler
is
an
awful
sight
keggs
laughed
a
hard
laugh
you
and
your
cousins
from
america
what
about
my
cousins
from
america
yes
what
about
them
that
just
what
lord
belpher
and
me
have
been
asking
ourselves
i
do
know
wot
you
talking
about
you
soon
will
young
blighted
albert
who
sneaked
that
american
fellow
into
the
to
meet
lady
maud
i
never
think
i
did
see
through
your
little
game
why
i
knew
from
the
first
yes
you
did
then
why
did
you
let
him
into
the
place
keggs
snorted
triumphantly
there
you
admit
it
it
was
that
feller
too
late
albert
saw
his
false
move
a
move
which
in
a
normal
state
of
health
he
would
have
scorned
to
make
just
as
napoleon
minus
a
would
have
scorned
the
blunder
that
sent
his
cuirassiers
plunging
to
destruction
in
the
sunken
road
i
do
know
what
you
torkin
about
he
said
weakly
well
said
keggs
i
have
time
to
stand
chatting
with
you
i
must
be
going
back
to
lordship
to
tell
of
the
trick
you
played
on
him
a
second
spasm
shook
albert
to
the
core
of
his
being
the
double
assault
was
too
much
for
him
betrayed
by
the
body
the
spirit
yielded
you
would
do
that
mr
keggs
there
was
a
white
flag
in
every
syllable
i
would
if
i
did
my
duty
but
you
do
care
about
that
urged
albert
ingratiatingly
i
have
to
think
it
over
mused
keggs
i
do
want
to
be
on
a
young
boy
he
struggled
silently
with
himself
ruinin
prospecks
an
inspiration
seemed
to
come
to
him
all
right
young
blighted
albert
he
said
briskly
i
go
against
my
better
nature
this
once
and
chance
it
and
now
young
feller
me
lad
you
just
over
that
ticket
of
yours
you
know
what
i
alloodin
to
that
ticket
you
at
the
sweep
the
one
with
x
on
it
albert
indomitable
spirit
triumphed
for
a
moment
over
his
stricken
body
that
likely
ai
it
keggs
sighed
the
sigh
of
a
good
man
who
has
done
his
best
to
help
a
and
has
been
baffled
by
the
other
perversity
just
as
you
please
he
said
sorrowfully
but
i
did
i
should
to
go
to
lordship
and
tell
deceived
him
albert
capitulated
yer
are
a
piece
of
paper
changed

men
like
you
wot
lead
to
the
crime
in
the
country
much
obliged
me
lad
you
walk
a
mile
in
the
snow
you
would
continued
albert
pursuing
his
train
of
thought
to
rob
a
starving
beggar
of
a
who
robbing
anyone
do
you
talk
so
quick
young
man
doing
the
right
thing
by
you
you
can
my
ticket
marked
byng
it
a
fair
exchange
and
no
one
the
worse
fat
lot
of
good
that
is
that
as
it
may
be
anyhow
there
it
is
keggs
prepared
to
withdraw
you
too
young
to
all
that
money
albert
you
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
it
would
make
you
there
other
things
in
the
world
besides
winning
sweepstakes
and
properly
speaking
you
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
to
draw
at
all
being
so
young
albert
groaned
hollowly
when
you
finished
torkin
i
wish
you
kindly
have
the
goodness
to
leave
me
alone
i
not
meself
that
said
keggs
cordially
is
a
bit
of
luck
for
you
my
boy
accept
my
felicitations
defeat
is
the
test
of
the
great
man
your
true
general
is
not
he
who
rides
to
triumph
on
the
tide
of
an
easy
victory
but
the
one
who
when
crushed
to
earth
can
bend
himself
to
the
task
of
planning
methods
of
rising
again
such
a
one
was
albert
the
observe
albert
in
his
attic
bedroom
scarcely
more
than
an
hour
later
his
body
has
practically
ceased
to
trouble
him
and
his
soaring
spirit
has
come
into
its
own
again
with
the
exception
of
a
now
very
occasional
spasm
his
physical
anguish
has
passed
and
he
is

albert
teacher
said
it
to
albert
on
the
occasion
of
his
taking
up
his
duties
at
the
castle
and
it
stuck
in
his
memory
fortunately
for
it
expressed
exactly
what
albert
wished
to
say
from
now
on
reggie
byng
progress
with
lady
maud
marsh
was
to
be
the
thing
nearest
to
albert
heart
and
george
meanwhile
little
knowing
how
fate
has
changed
in
a
flash
an
ally
into
an
opponent
he
is
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
near
the
castle
gate
the
night
is
very
beautiful
the
barked
spots
on
his
hands
and
knees
are
hurting
much
less
now
and
he
is
full
of
long
sweet
thoughts
he
has
just
discovered
the
extraordinary
resemblance
which
had
not
struck
him
as
he
was
climbing
up
the
knotted
sheet
between
his
own
position
and
that
of
the
hero
of
tennyson
maud
a
poem
to
which
he
has
always
been
particularly
addicted
and
never
more
so
than
during
the
days
since
he
learned
the
name
of
the
only
possible
girl
when
he
has
not
been
playing

chapter
lord
belpher
birthday
dawned
brightly
heralded
in
by
much
twittering
of
sparrows
in
the
ivy
outside
his
bedroom
these
percy
did
not
hear
for
he
was
sound
asleep
and
had
had
a
late
night
the
first
sound
that
was
able
to
penetrate
his
heavy
slumber
and
rouse
him
to
a
realization
that
his
birthday
had
arrived
was
the
piercing
cry
of
reggie
byng
on
his
way
to
the
across
the
corridor
it
was
reggie
disturbing
custom
to
urge
himself
on
to
a
cold
bath
with
encouraging
yells
and
the
noise
of
this
performance
followed
by
violent
splashing
and
a
series
of
sharp
howls
as
the
sponge

made
sleep
an
impossibility
within
a
radius
of
many
yards
percy
sat
up
in
bed
and
cursed
reggie
silently
he
discovered
that
he
had
a
headache
presently
the
door
flew
open
and
the
vocalist
entered
in
person
clad
in
a
pink
bathrobe
and
very
tousled
and
rosy
from
the
tub
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
boots
old
thing
reggie
burst
rollickingly
into
song
i
today
today
i
got
the
key
of
the
door
never
been
before
and
father
says
i
can
do
what
i
like
so
shout
i
a
jolly
good
fellow
today
lord
belpher
scowled
morosely
i
wish
you
would
make
that
infernal
noise
what
infernal
noise
that
singing
my
god
this
man
has
wounded
me
said
reggie
i
a
headache
i
thought
you
would
have
laddie
when
i
saw
you
getting
away
with
the
liquid
last
night
an
photograph
of
your
liver
would
show
something
that
looked
like
a
crumpled
studded
with
you
ought
to
take
more
exercise
dear
heart
except
for
sloshing
that
policeman
you
have
done
anything
athletic
for
years
i
wish
you
would
harp
on
that
affair
reggie
sat
down
on
the
bed
between
ourselves
old
man
he
said
confidentially
i
also
i
myself
reginald
byng
in
person
was
perhaps
a
shade
polluted
during
the
evening
i
give
you
my
honest
word
that
just
after
dinner
i
saw
three
versions
of
your
uncle
the
bishop
standing
in
a
row
side
by
side
i
tell
you
laddie
that
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
strayed
into
a
bishop
beano
at
exeter
hall
or
the
athenaeum
or
wherever
it
is
those
chappies
collect
in
gangs
then
the
three
bishops
sort
of
congealed
into
one
bishop
a
trifle
blurred
about
the
outlines
and
i
felt
relieved
but
what
convinced
me
that
i
had
emptied
a
flagon
or
so
too
many
was
a
rather
rummy
thing
that
occurred
later
on
have
you
ever
happened
during
one
of
these
feasts
of
reason
and
flows
of
soul
when
you
were
bubbling
over
with
have
you
ever
happened
to
see
things
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
had
a
deuced
odd
experience
last
night
i
could
have
sworn
that
one
of
the
was
that
fellow
who
knocked
off
your
hat
in
piccadilly
lord
belpher
who
had
sunk
back
on
to
the
pillows
at
entrance
and
had
been
listening
to
his
talk
with
only
intermittent
attention
shot
up
in
bed
what
absolutely
my
mistake
of
course
but
there
it
was
the
fellow
might
have
been
his
double
but
you
never
seen
the
man
oh
yes
i
have
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
met
him
on
the
links
yesterday
i
gone
out
there
alone
rather
expecting
to
have
a
round
with
the
but
finding
this
lad
there
i
suggested
that
we
might
go
round
together
we
did
eighteen
holes
and
he
licked
the
boots
off
me
very
hot
stuff
he
was
and
after
the
game
he
took
me
off
to
his
cottage
and
gave
me
a
drink
he
lives
at
the
cottage
next
door
to
platt
farm
so
you
see
it
was
the
identical
chappie
we
got
extremely
matey
like
brothers
absolutely
so
you
can
understand
what
a
shock
it
gave
me
when
i
found
what
i
took
to
be
the
same
man
serving
bracers
to
the
multitude
the
same
evening
one
of
those
nasty
jars
that
cause
a
fellow
head
to
swim
a
bit
do
you
know
and
make
him
lose
confidence
in
himself
lord
belpher
did
not
reply
his
brain
was
whirling
so
he
had
been
right
after
all
you
know
pursued
reggie
seriously
i
think
you
are
making
the
bloomer
of
a
lifetime
over
this
chappie
misjudged
him
he
a
sort
take
it
from
me
nobody
could
have
got
out
of
the
bunker
at
the
fifteenth
hole
better
than
he
did
if
you
take
my
advice
you
conciliate
the
feller
a
really
golfer
is
what
you
need
in
the
family
besides
even
leaving
out
of
the
question
the
fact
that
he
can
do
things
with
a
niblick
that
i
did
think
anybody
except
the
pro
could
do
he
a
corking
good
sort
a
stout
fellow
in
every
respect
i
took
to
the
chappie
he
all
right
grab
him
boots
before
he
gets
away
that
my
tip
to
you
you
never
regret
it
from
first
to
last
this
lad
did
foozle
a
single
drive
and
his
has
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
well
got
to
dress
i
suppose
waste
life
springtime
sitting
here
talking
to
you
laddie
we
shall
meet
anon
lord
belpher
leaped
from
his
bed
he
was
feeling
worse
than
ever
now
and
a
glance
into
the
mirror
told
him
that
he
looked
rather
worse
than
he
felt
late
nights
and
insufficient
sleep
added
to
the
need
of
a
shave
always
made
him
look
like
something
that
should
have
been
swept
up
and
taken
away
to
the
and
as
for
his
physical
condition
talking
to
reggie
byng
never
tended
to
make
you
feel
better
when
you
had
a
headache
reggie
manner
was
not
soothing
and
on
this
particular
morning
his
choice
of
a
topic
had
been
unusually
irritating
lord
belpher
told
himself
that
he
could
not
understand
reggie
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
his
mind
quite
clear
as
to
the
exact
relations
between
the
latter
and
his
sister
maud
but
he
had
always
been
under
the
impression
that
if
they
were
not
actually
engaged
they
were
on
the
verge
of
becoming
so
and
it
was
maddening
to
have
to
listen
to
reggie
advocating
the
claims
of
a
rival
as
if
he
had
no
personal
interest
in
the
affair
at
all
percy
felt
for
his
complaisant
friend
something
of
the
annoyance
which
a
householder
feels
for
the
watchdog
whom
he
finds
fraternizing
with
the
burglar
why
reggie
more
than
anyone
else
ought
to
be
foaming
with
rage
at
the
insolence
of
this
american
fellow
in
coming
down
to
belpher
and
planting
himself
at
the
castle
gates
instead
of
which
on
his
own
showing
he
appeared
to
have
adopted
an
attitude
towards
him
which
would
have
excited
remark
if
adopted
by
david
towards
jonathan
he
seemed
to
spend
all
his
spare
time
frolicking
with
the
man
on
the
and
hobnobbing
with
him
in
his
house
lord
belpher
was
thoroughly
upset
it
was
impossible
to
prove
it
or
to
do
anything
about
it
now
but
he
was
convinced
that
the
fellow
had
wormed
his
way
into
the
castle
in
the
guise
of
a
waiter
he
had
probably
met
maud
and
plotted
further
meetings
with
her
this
thing
was
becoming
unendurable
one
thing
was
certain
the
family
honour
was
in
his
hands
anything
that
was
to
be
done
to
keep
maud
away
from
the
intruder
must
be
done
by
himself
reggie
was
hopeless
he
was
capable
as
far
as
percy
could
see
of
escorting
maud
to
the
fellow
door
in
his
own
car
and
leaving
her
on
the
threshold
with
his
blessing
as
for
lord
marshmoreton
roses
and
the
family
history
took
up
so
much
of
his
time
that
he
could
not
be
counted
on
for
anything
but
moral
support
he
percy
must
do
the
active
work
he
had
just
come
to
this
decision
when
approaching
the
window
and
gazing
down
into
the
grounds
he
perceived
his
sister
maud
walking
rapidly
and
so
it
seemed
to
him
with
a
furtive
air
down
the
east
drive
and
it
was
to
the
east
that
platt
farm
and
the
cottage
next
door
to
it
lay
at
the
moment
of
this
discovery
percy
was
in
a
costume
ill
adapted
for
the
taking
of
country
walks
reggie
remarks
about
his
liver
had
struck
home
and
it
had
been
his
intention
by
way
of
a
corrective
to
his
headache
and
a
general
feeling
of
swollen
to
do
a
little
work
before
his
bath
with
a
pair
of
indian
clubs
he
had
arrayed
himself
for
this
purpose
in
an
old
sweater
a
pair
of
grey
flannel
trousers
and
patent
leather
evening
shoes
it
was
not
the
garb
he
would
have
chosen
himself
for
a
ramble
but
time
was
flying
even
to
put
on
a
pair
of
boots
is
a
matter
of
minutes
and
in
another
moment
or
two
maud
would
be
out
of
sight
percy
ran
downstairs
snatched
up
a
soft
which
proved
too
late
to
belong
to
a
person
with
a
head
two
sizes
smaller
than
his
own
and
raced
out
into
the
grounds
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
maud
disappearing
round
the
corner
of
the
drive
lord
belpher
had
never
belonged
to
that
virile
class
of
the
community
which
considers
running
a
pleasure
and
a
pastime
at
oxford
on
those
occasions
when
the
members
of
his
college
had
turned
out
on
raw
afternoons
to
trot
along
the
encouraging
the
college
eight
with
yelling
and
the
swinging
of
percy
had
always
stayed
prudently
in
his
rooms
with
tea
and
buttered
toast
thereby
avoiding
who
knows
what
colds
and
coughs
when
he
ran
he
ran
reluctantly
and
with
a
definite
object
in
view
such
as
the
catching
of
a
train
he
was
consequently
not
in
the
best
of
condition
and
the
sharp
sprint
which
was
imperative
at
this
juncture
if
he
was
to
keep
his
sister
in
view
left
him
spent
and
panting
but
he
had
the
reward
of
reaching
the
gates
of
the
drive
not
many
seconds
after
maud
and
of
seeing
her
walking
more
slowly
now
down
the
road
that
led
to
platt
this
confirmation
of
his
suspicions
enabled
him
momentarily
to
forget
the
blister
which
was
forming
on
the
heel
of
his
left
foot
he
set
out
after
her
at
a
good
pace
the
road
after
the
habit
of
country
roads
wound
and
twisted
the
quarry
was
frequently
out
of
sight
and
percy
anxiety
was
such
that
every
time
maud
vanished
he
broke
into
a
gallop
another
hundred
yards
and
the
blister
no
longer
consented
to
be
ignored
it
cried
for
attention
like
a
little
child
and
was
rapidly
insinuating
itself
into
a
position
in
the
scheme
of
things
where
it
threatened
to
become
the
centre
of
the
world
by
the
time
the
third
bend
in
the
road
was
reached
it
seemed
to
percy
that
this
blister
had
become
the
one
great
fact
in
an
unreal
universe
he
hobbled
painfully
and
when
he
stopped
suddenly
and
darted
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
his
foot
seemed
aflame
the
only
reason
why
the
blister
on
his
left
heel
did
not
at
this
juncture
attract
his
entire
attention
was
that
he
had
become
aware
that
there
was
another
of
equal
proportions
forming
on
his
right
heel
percy
had
stopped
and
sought
cover
in
the
hedge
because
as
he
rounded
the
bend
in
the
road
he
perceived
before
he
had
time
to
check
his
gallop
that
maud
had
also
stopped
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
looking
over
her
shoulder
not
ten
yards
away
had
she
seen
him
it
was
a
point
that
time
alone
could
solve
no
she
walked
on
again
she
had
not
seen
him
lord
belpher
by
means
of
a
notable
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
forgot
the
blisters
and
hurried
after
her
they
had
now
reached
that
point
in
the
road
where
three
choices
offer
themselves
to
the
wayfarer
by
going
straight
on
he
may
win
through
to
the
village
of
a
charming
little
place
with
a
norman
church
by
turning
to
the
left
he
may
visit
the
equally
seductive
hamlet
of
little
weeting
by
turning
to
the
right
off
the
main
road
and
going
down
a
leafy
lane
he
may
find
himself
at
the
door
of
platt
farm
when
maud
reaching
the
suddenly
swung
down
the
one
to
the
left
lord
belpher
was
for
the
moment
completely
baffled
reason
reasserted
its
way
the
next
minute
telling
him
that
this
was
but
a
ruse
whether
or
no
she
had
caught
sight
of
him
there
was
no
doubt
that
maud
intended
to
shake
off
any
possible
pursuit
by
taking
this
speciously
innocent
turning
and
making
a
detour
she
could
have
no
possible
motive
in
going
to
little
weeting
he
had
never
been
to
little
weeting
in
his
life
and
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
maud
had
either
the
informed
him
a
statement
strenuously
denied
by
the
that
the
distance
to
little
weeting
was
one
and
a
half
miles
lord
belpher
view
of
it
was
that
it
was
nearer
fifty
he
dragged
himself
along
wearily
it
was
simpler
now
to
keep
maud
in
sight
for
the
road
ran
straight
but
there
being
a
catch
in
everything
in
this
world
the
process
was
also
messier
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
it
was
necessary
for
percy
to
leave
the
road
and
tramp
along
in
the
deep
ditch
which
ran
parallel
to
it
there
is
nothing
about
these
ditches
which
accompany
english
country
roads
they
know
they
are
intended
to
be
ditches
not
mere
furrows
and
they
behave
as
such
the
one
that
sheltered
lord
belpher
was
so
deep
that
only
his
head
and
neck
protruded
above
the
level
of
the
road
and
so
dirty
that
a
bare
twenty
yards
of
travel
was
sufficient
to
coat
him
with
mud
rain
once
fallen
is
reluctant
to
leave
the
english
ditch
it
nestles
inside
it
for
weeks
forming
a
rich
substance
which
has
to
be
stirred
to
be
believed
percy
stirred
it
he
churned
it
he
ploughed
and
sloshed
through
it
the
mud
stuck
to
him
like
a
brother
nevertheless
being
a
determined
young
man
he
did
not
give
in
once
he
lost
a
shoe
but
a
little
searching
recovered
that
on
another
occasion
a
passing
dog
seeing
things
going
on
in
the
ditch
which
in
his
opinion
should
not
have
been
going
on
he
was
a
dog
unused
to
coming
upon
heads
moving
along
the
road
without
bodies
attached
accompanied
percy
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
causing
him
exquisite
discomfort
by
making
sudden
runs
at
his
face
a
stone
settled
this
little
misunderstanding
and
percy
proceeded
on
his
journey
alone
he
had
maud
well
in
view
when
to
his
surprise
she
left
the
road
and
turned
into
the
gate
of
a
house
which
stood
not
far
from
the
church
lord
belpher
regained
the
road
and
remained
there
a
puzzled
man
a
dreadful
thought
came
to
him
that
he
might
have
had
all
this
trouble
and
anguish
for
no
reason
this
house
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
a
vicarage
maud
could
have
no
reason
that
was
not
innocent
for
going
there
had
he
gone
through
all
this
merely
to
see
his
sister
paying
a
visit
to
a
clergyman
too
late
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
quite
easily
be
on
visiting
terms
with
the
clergy
of
little
weeting
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
been
away
at
oxford
for
many
weeks
a
period
of
time
in
which
maud
finding
life
in
the
country
weigh
upon
her
might
easily
have
interested
herself
charitably
in
the
life
of
this
village
he
paused
irresolutely
he
was
baffled
maud
meanwhile
had
rung
the
bell
ever
since
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
had
perceived
her
brother
percy
dodging
about
in
the
background
her
active
young
mind
had
been
busying
itself
with
schemes
for
throwing
him
off
the
trail
she
must
see
george
that
morning
she
could
not
wait
another
day
before
establishing
communication
between
herself
and
geoffrey
but
it
was
not
till
she
reached
little
weeting
that
there
occurred
to
her
any
plan
that
promised
success
a
trim
maid
opened
the
door
is
the
vicar
in
no
miss
he
went
out
half
an
hour
back
maud
was
as
baffled
for
the
moment
as
her
brother
percy
now
leaning
against
the
vicarage
wall
in
a
state
of
advanced
exhaustion
oh
dear
she
said
the
maid
was
sympathetic
ferguson
the
curate
miss
he
here
if
he
would
do
maud
brightened
he
would
do
splendidly
will
you
ask
him
if
i
can
see
him
for
a
moment
very
well
miss
what
name
please
he
wo
know
my
name
will
you
please
tell
him
that
a
lady
wishes
to
see
him
yes
miss
wo
you
step
in
the
front
door
closed
behind
maud
she
followed
the
maid
into
the
presently
a
young
small
curate
entered
he
had
a
willing
benevolent
face
he
looked
alert
and
helpful
you
wished
to
see
me
i
am
so
sorry
to
trouble
you
said
maud
rocking
the
young
man
in
his
tracks
with
a
smile
of
dazzling
brilliancy
no
trouble
i
assure
you
said
the
curate
dizzily
but
there
is
a
man
following
me
the
curate
clicked
his
tongue
indignantly
a
rough
sort
of
a
tramp
kind
of
man
he
has
been
following
me
for
miles
and
i
frightened
brute
i
think
he
outside
now
i
ca
think
what
he
wants
would
you
would
you
mind
being
kind
enough
to
go
and
send
him
away
the
eyes
that
had
settled
george
fate
for
all
eternity
flashed
upon
the
curate
who
blinked
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
drew
himself
up
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
die
for
her
if
you
will
wait
here
he
said
i
will
go
and
send
him
about
his
business
it
is
disgraceful
that
the
public
highways
should
be
rendered
unsafe
in
this
manner
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
maud
gratefully
i
ca
help
thinking
the
poor
fellow
may
be
a
little
crazy
it
seems
so
odd
of
him
to
follow
me
all
that
way
walking
in
the
ditch
too
walking
in
the
ditch
yes
he
walked
most
of
the
way
in
the
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
he
seemed
to
prefer
it
i
ca
think
why
lord
belpher
leaning
against
the
wall
and
trying
to
decide
whether
his
right
or
left
foot
hurt
him
the
more
excruciatingly
became
aware
that
a
curate
was
standing
before
him
regarding
him
through
a
pair
of
with
a
disapproving
and
hostile
expression
lord
belpher
returned
his
gaze
neither
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
other
percy
thought
he
had
seen
curates
and
the
curate
thought
he
had
seen
more
prepossessing
tramps
come
come
said
the
curate
this
wo
do
my
man
a
few
hours
earlier
lord
belpher
had
been
startled
when
addressed
by
george
as
sir
to
be
called
my
man
took
his
breath
away
completely
the
gift
of
seeing
ourselves
as
others
see
us
is
as
the
poet
indicates
vouchsafed
to
few
men
lord
belpher
not
being
one
of
these
fortunates
had
not
the
slightest
conception
how
intensely
revolting
his
personal
appearance
was
at
that
moment
the
eyes
the
growth
of
stubble
on
the
cheeks
and
the
thick
coating
of
mud
which
had
resulted
from
his
rambles
in
the
ditch
combined
to
render
him
a
horrifying
object
how
dare
you
follow
that
young
lady
i
a
good
mind
to
give
you
in
charge
percy
was
outraged
i
her
brother
he
was
about
to
substantiate
the
statement
by
giving
his
name
but
stopped
himself
he
had
had
enough
of
letting
his
name
come
out
on
occasions
like
the
present
when
the
policeman
had
arrested
him
in
the
haymarket
his
first
act
had
been
to
thunder
his
identity
at
the
man
and
the
policeman
without
saying
in
so
many
words
that
he
disbelieved
him
had
hinted
scepticism
by
replying
that
he
himself
was
the
king
of
brixton
i
her
brother
he
repeated
thickly
the
curate
disapproval
deepened
in
a
sense
we
are
all
brothers
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
considering
that
this
derelict
had
made
an
impudent
and
abominable
of
fact
not
unnaturally
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
victim
of
the
demon
rum
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
he
said
severely
sad
piece
of
human
wreckage
as
you
are
you
speak
like
an
educated
man
have
you
no
do
you
never
search
your
heart
and
shudder
at
the
horrible
degradation
which
you
have
brought
on
yourself
by
sheer
weakness
of
will
he
raised
his
voice
the
subject
of
temperance
was
one
very
near
to
the
curate
heart
the
vicar
himself
had
complimented
him
only
yesterday
on
the
good
his
sermons
against
the
drink
evil
were
doing
in
the
village
and
the
landlord
of
the
three
pigeons
down
the
road
had
on
several
occasions
spoken
bitter
things
about
blighters
who
came
taking
the
living
away
from
honest
folks
it
is
easy
enough
to
stop
if
you
will
but
use
a
little
resolution
you
say
to
yourself
one
wo
hurt
me
perhaps
not
but
can
you
be
content
with
just
one
ah
no
my
man
there
is
no
middle
way
for
such
as
you
it
must
be
all
or
nothing
stop
it
now
now
while
you
still
retain
some
semblance
of
humanity
soon
it
will
be
too
late
kill
that
craving
stifle
it
strangle
it
make
up
your
mind
now
now
that
not
another
drop
of
the
accursed
stuff
shall
pass
your
lips
the
curate
paused
he
perceived
that
enthusiasm
was
leading
him
away
from
the
main
issue
a
little
perseverance
he
concluded
rapidly
and
you
will
soon
find
that
cocoa
gives
you
exactly
the
same
pleasure
and
now
will
you
please
be
getting
along
you
have
frightened
the
young
lady
and
she
can
not
continue
her
walk
unless
i
assure
her
that
you
have
gone
away
fatigue
pain
and
the
annoyance
of
having
to
listen
to
this
but
utterances
had
combined
to
induce
in
percy
a
condition
bordering
on
hysteria
he
stamped
his
foot
and
uttered
a
howl
as
the
blister
warned
him
with
a
sharp
twinge
that
this
sort
of
behaviour
could
not
be
permitted
stop
talking
he
bellowed
stop
talking
like
an
idiot
i
going
to
stay
here
till
that
girl
comes
out
if
have
to
wait
all
day
the
curate
regarded
percy
thoughtfully
percy
was
no
hercules
but
then
neither
was
the
curate
and
in
any
case
though
no
hercules
percy
was
undeniably
an
brute
strategy
rather
than
force
seemed
to
the
curate
to
be
indicated
he
paused
a
while
as
one
who
weighs
pros
and
cons
then
spoke
briskly
with
the
air
of
the
man
who
has
decided
to
yield
a
point
with
a
good
grace
dear
dear
he
said
that
wo
do
you
say
you
are
this
young
lady
brother
yes
i
do
then
perhaps
you
had
better
come
with
me
into
the
house
and
we
will
speak
to
her
all
right
follow
me
percy
followed
him
down
the
trim
gravel
walk
they
passed
and
up
the
neat
stone
steps
maud
peeping
through
the
curtains
thought
herself
the
victim
of
a
monstrous
betrayal
or
equally
monstrous
blunder
but
she
did
not
know
the
rev
cyril
ferguson
no
general
adroitly
leading
the
enemy
on
by
strategic
retreat
ever
had
a
situation
more
thoroughly
in
hand
passing
with
his
companion
through
the
open
door
he
crossed
the
hall
to
another
door
discreetly
closed
wait
in
here
he
said
lord
belpher
moved
unsuspectingly
forward
a
hand
pressed
sharply
against
the
small
of
his
back
behind
him
a
door
slammed
and
a
key
clicked
he
was
trapped
groping
in
egyptian
darkness
his
hands
met
a
coat
then
a
hat
then
an
umbrella
then
he
stumbled
over
a
and
fell
against
a
wall
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
but
his
sense
of
touch
told
him
all
he
needed
to
know
he
had
been
added
to
the
collection
of
odds
and
ends
in
the
closet
reserved
for
that
purpose
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
and
kicked
it
he
did
not
repeat
the
performance
his
feet
were
in
no
shape
for
kicking
things
percy
gallant
soul
abandoned
the
struggle
with
a
feeble
oath
he
sat
down
on
a
box
containing
croquet
implements
and
gave
himself
up
to
thought
you
be
quite
safe
now
the
curate
was
saying
in
the
adjoining
room
not
without
a
touch
of
complacent
such
as
becomes
the
victor
in
a
battle
of
wits
i
have
locked
him
in
the
cupboard
he
will
be
quite
happy
there
an
incorrect
statement
this
you
may
now
continue
your
walk
in
perfect
safety
thank
you
ever
so
much
said
maud
but
i
do
hope
he
wo
be
violent
when
you
let
him
out
i
shall
not
let
him
out
replied
the
curate
who
though
brave
was
not
rash
i
shall
depute
the
task
to
a
worthy
fellow
named
willis
in
whom
i
shall
have
every
confidence
he
he
is
in
fact
our
local
blacksmith
and
so
it
came
about
that
when
after
a
vigil
that
seemed
to
last
for
a
lifetime
percy
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
burst
forth
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
he
experienced
an
almost
instant
quieting
of
his
excited
nervous
system
confronting
him
was
a
vast
man
whose
muscles
like
those
of
that
other
and
more
celebrated
village
blacksmith
were
plainly
as
strong
as
iron
bands
this
man
eyed
percy
with
a
chilly
eye
well
he
said
what
troublin
you
percy
gulped
the
man
mere
appearance
was
a
sedative
er
nothing
he
replied
nothing
there
better
had
be
said
the
man
darkly
ferguson
give
me
this
to
give
to
you
take
it
percy
took
it
it
was
a
shilling
and
this
the
second
gift
was
a
small
paper
pamphlet
it
was
entitled
the
time
and
seemed
to
be
a
story
of
some
kind
at
any
rate
percy
eyes
before
they
began
to
swim
in
a
manner
that
prevented
steady
reading
caught
the
words
job
roberts
had
always
been
a
man
but
one
day
as
he
was
coming
out
of
the
he
was
about
to
hurl
it
from
him
when
he
met
the
other
eye
and
desisted
rarely
had
lord
belpher
encountered
a
man
with
a
more
speaking
eye
and
now
you
get
along
said
the
man
you
pop
off
and
i
going
to
watch
you
do
it
too
and
if
i
find
you
sneakin
off
to
the
three
pigeons
his
pause
was
more
eloquent
than
his
speech
and
nearly
as
eloquent
as
his
eye
lord
belpher
tucked
the
tract
into
his
sweater
pocketed
the
shilling
and
left
the
house
for
nearly
a
mile
down
the
highway
he
was
aware
of
a
presence
in
his
rear
but
he
continued
on
his
way
without
a
glance
behind
like
one
that
on
a
lonely
road
doth
walk
in
fear
and
dread
and
having
once
looked
back
walks
on
and
turns
no
more
his
head
because
he
knows
a
frightful
fiend
doth
close
behind
him
tread
maud
made
her
way
across
the
fields
to
the
cottage
down
by
platt
her
heart
was
as
light
as
the
breeze
that
ruffled
the
green
hedges
gaily
she
tripped
towards
the
cottage
door
her
hand
was
just
raised
to
knock
when
from
within
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
she
had
reached
her
goal
but
her
father
had
anticipated
her
lord
marshmoreton
had
selected
the
same
moment
as
herself
for
paying
a
call
upon
george
bevan
maud
tiptoed
away
and
hurried
back
to
the
castle
never
before
had
she
so
clearly
realized
what
a
handicap
an
adhesive
family
can
be
to
a
young
girl
chapter
at
the
moment
of
lord
marshmoreton
arrival
george
was
reading
a
letter
from
billie
dore
which
had
come
by
that
morning
post
it
dealt
mainly
with
the
vicissitudes
experienced
by
miss
friend
miss
sinclair
in
her
relations
with
the
man
spenser
gray
spenser
gray
it
seemed
had
been
behaving
oddly
ardent
towards
miss
sinclair
almost
to
an
embarrassing
point
in
the
early
stages
of
their
acquaintance
he
had
suddenly
cooled
at
a
recent
lunch
had
behaved
with
a
strange
aloofness
and
now
at
this
writing
had
vanished
altogether
leaving
nothing
behind
him
but
an
abrupt
note
to
the
effect
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
go
abroad
and
that
much
as
it
was
to
be
regretted
he
and
she
would
probably
never
meet
again
and
if
wrote
miss
dore
justifiably
annoyed
after
saying
all
those
things
to
the
poor
kid
and
telling
her
she
was
the
only
thing
in
sight
he
thinks
he
can
just
slide
off
with
a
good
luck
and
god
bless
you
he
got
another
guess
coming
and
that
not
all
he
has
gone
abroad
i
saw
him
in
piccadilly
this
afternoon
he
saw
me
too
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
ducked
down
a
if
you
please
he
must
have
run
like
a
rabbit
at
that
because
when
i
got
there
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
tell
you
george
there
something
funny
about
all
this
having
been
made
once
or
twice
before
the
confidant
of
the
tempestuous
romances
of
billie
friends
which
always
seemed
to
go
wrong
somewhere
in
the
middle
and
to
die
a
natural
death
before
arriving
at
any
definite
point
george
was
not
particularly
interested
except
in
so
far
as
the
letter
afforded
rather
comforting
evidence
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
was
having
trouble
of
the
kind
he
skimmed
through
the
rest
of
it
and
had
just
finished
when
there
was
a
sharp
rap
at
the
front
door
come
in
called
george
there
entered
a
sturdy
little
man
of
middle
age
whom
at
first
sight
george
could
not
place
and
yet
he
had
the
impression
that
he
had
seen
him
before
then
he
recognized
him
as
the
gardener
to
whom
he
had
given
the
note
for
maud
that
day
at
the
castle
the
alteration
in
the
man
costume
was
what
had
momentarily
baffled
george
when
they
had
met
in
the
the
other
had
been
arrayed
in
untidy
gardening
clothes
now
presumably
in
his
sunday
suit
it
was
amusing
to
observe
how
almost
dapper
he
had
become
really
you
might
have
passed
him
in
the
lane
and
taken
him
for
some
neighbouring
squire
george
heart
raced
your
lover
is
ever
optimistic
and
he
could
conceive
of
no
errand
that
could
have
brought
this
man
to
his
cottage
unless
he
was
charged
with
the
delivery
of
a
note
from
maud
he
spared
a
moment
from
his
happiness
to
congratulate
himself
on
having
picked
such
an
admirable
here
evidently
was
one
of
those
trusty
old
retainers
you
read
about
faithful
willing
discreet
ready
to
do
anything
for
the
little
missy
bless
her
heart
probably
he
had
danced
maud
on
his
knee
in
her
infancy
and
with
a
affection
had
watched
her
at
her
childish
sports
george
beamed
at
the
honest
fellow
and
felt
in
his
pocket
to
make
sure
that
a
suitable
tip
lay
safely
therein
good
morning
he
said
good
morning
replied
the
man
a
purist
might
have
said
he
spoke
gruffly
and
without
geniality
but
that
is
the
beauty
of
these
old
retainers
they
make
a
point
of
deliberately
trying
to
deceive
strangers
as
to
the
goldenness
of
their
hearts
by
adopting
a
forbidding
manner
and
good
morning
not
good
morning
sir
sturdy
independence
you
observe
as
befits
a
free
man
george
closed
the
door
carefully
he
glanced
into
the
kitchen
platt
was
not
there
all
was
well
you
have
brought
a
note
from
lady
maud
the
honest
fellow
rather
dour
expression
seemed
to
grow
a
shade
bleaker
if
you
are
alluding
to
lady
maud
marsh
my
daughter
he
replied
frostily
i
have
not
for
the
past
few
days
george
had
been
no
stranger
to
shocks
and
had
indeed
come
almost
to
regard
them
as
part
of
the
normal
everyday
life
but
this
latest
one
had
a
stumbling
effect
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
so
you
ought
to
replied
the
earl
george
swallowed
once
or
twice
to
relieve
a
curious
dryness
of
the
mouth
are
you
lord
marshmoreton
i
am
good
lord
you
seem
surprised
it
nothing
muttered
george
at
least
you
i
mean
to
say
it
only
that
there
a
curious
resemblance
between
you
and
one
of
your
gardeners
at
the
castle
i
i
daresay
you
have
noticed
it
yourself
my
hobby
is
gardening
light
broke
upon
george
then
was
it
really
you
it
was
george
sat
down
this
opens
up
a
new
line
of
thought
he
said
lord
marshmoreton
remained
standing
he
shook
his
head
sternly
it
wo
do
i
have
never
heard
your
name
bevan
replied
george
rather
relieved
at
being
able
to
remember
it
in
the
midst
of
his
mental
turmoil
it
wo
do
bevan
it
must
stop
i
allude
to
this
absurd
entanglement
between
yourself
and
my
daughter
it
must
stop
at
once
it
seemed
to
george
that
such
an
entanglement
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
begun
but
he
did
not
say
so
lord
marshmoreton
resumed
his
remarks
lady
caroline
had
sent
him
to
the
cottage
to
be
stern
and
his
firm
resolve
to
be
stern
lent
his
style
of
speech
something
of
the
measured
solemnity
and
careful
phrasing
of
his
occasional
orations
in
the
house
of
lords
i
have
no
wish
to
be
unduly
hard
upon
the
indiscretions
of
youth
youth
is
the
period
of
romance
when
the
heart
rules
the
head
i
myself
was
once
a
young
man
well
you
practically
that
now
said
george
eh
cried
lord
marshmoreton
forgetting
the
thread
of
his
discourse
in
the
shock
of
pleased
surprise
you
do
look
a
day
over
forty
oh
come
come
my
boy
i
mean
mr
bevan
you
do
honestly
i
the
prime
of
life
and
you
do
think
i
look
it
you
certainly
do
well
well
well
by
the
way
have
you
tobacco
my
boy
i
came
without
my
pouch
just
at
your
elbow
pretty
good
stuff
i
bought
it
in
the
village
the
same
i
smoke
myself
quite
a
coincidence
distinctly
match
thank
you
i
have
one
george
filled
his
own
pipe
the
thing
was
becoming
a
what
was
i
saying
said
lord
marshmoreton
blowing
a
comfortable
cloud
oh
yes
he
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
with
a
touch
of
embarrassment
yes
yes
to
be
sure
there
was
an
awkward
silence
you
must
see
for
yourself
said
the
earl
how
impossible
it
is
george
shook
his
head
i
may
be
slow
at
grasping
a
thing
but
i
bound
to
say
i
see
that
lord
marshmoreton
recalled
some
of
the
things
his
sister
had
told
him
to
say
for
one
thing
what
do
we
know
of
you
you
are
a
perfect
stranger
well
we
all
getting
acquainted
pretty
quick
do
you
think
i
met
your
son
in
piccadilly
and
had
a
long
talk
with
him
and
now
you
are
paying
me
a
neighbourly
visit
this
was
not
intended
to
be
a
social
call
but
it
has
become
one
and
then
that
is
one
point
i
wish
to
make
you
know
ours
is
an
old
family
i
would
like
to
remind
you
that
there
were
marshmoretons
in
belpher
before
the
war
of
the
roses
there
were
bevans
in
brooklyn
before
the
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
only
pointing
out
that
i
can
trace
my
ancestry
a
long
way
you
have
to
trace
things
a
long
way
in
brooklyn
if
you
want
to
find
them
i
have
never
heard
of
brooklyn
you
heard
of
new
york
certainly
new
york
one
of
the
outlying
suburbs
lord
marshmoreton
relit
his
pipe
he
had
a
feeling
that
they
were
wandering
from
the
point
it
is
quite
impossible
i
ca
see
it
maud
is
so
young
your
daughter
could
be
nothing
else
too
young
to
know
her
own
mind
pursued
lord
marshmoreton
resolutely
crushing
down
a
flutter
of
pleasure
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
singularly
agreeable
man
was
making
things
very
difficult
for
him
it
was
disarming
to
discover
that
he
was
really
capital
company
the
best
indeed
that
the
earl
could
remember
to
have
discovered
in
the
more
recent
period
of
his
rather
lonely
life
at
present
of
course
she
fancies
that
she
is
very
much
in
love
with
you
it
is
absurd
you
need
tell
me
that
said
george
really
it
was
only
the
fact
that
people
seemed
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
call
at
his
cottage
and
tell
him
that
maud
loved
him
that
kept
him
from
feeling
his
cause
perfectly
hopeless
it
incredible
it
a
miracle
you
are
a
romantic
young
man
and
you
no
doubt
for
the
moment
suppose
that
you
are
in
love
with
her
no
george
was
not
going
to
allow
a
remark
like
that
to
pass
unchallenged
you
are
wrong
there
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
there
is
no
question
of
its
being
momentary
or
supposititious
or
anything
of
that
kind
i
am
in
love
with
your
daughter
i
was
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
her
i
always
shall
be
she
is
the
only
girl
in
the
world
stuff
and
nonsense
not
at
all
absolute
cold
fact
you
have
known
her
so
little
time
long
enough
lord
marshmoreton
sighed
you
are
upsetting
things
terribly
things
are
upsetting
me
terribly
you
are
causing
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
annoyance
so
did
romeo
eh
i
said
so
did
romeo
i
do
know
anything
about
romeo
as
far
as
love
is
concerned
i
begin
where
he
left
off
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
be
sensible
that
just
what
i
think
i
am
i
wish
i
could
get
you
to
see
my
point
of
view
i
do
see
your
point
of
view
but
dimly
you
see
my
own
takes
up
such
a
lot
of
the
foreground
there
was
a
pause
then
i
am
afraid
said
lord
marshmoreton
that
we
must
leave
matters
as
they
stand
until
they
can
be
altered
for
the
better
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
now
very
well
but
i
must
ask
you
to
understand
clearly
that
i
shall
have
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
stop
what
i
look
on
as
an
unfortunate
entanglement
i
understand
very
well
lord
marshmoreton
coughed
george
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
he
had
supposed
the
interview
to
be
at
an
end
but
the
other
made
no
move
to
go
there
seemed
to
be
something
on
the
earl
mind
there
is
ah
just
one
other
thing
said
lord
marshmoreton
he
coughed
again
he
felt
embarrassed
just
just
one
other
thing
he
repeated
the
reason
for
lord
marshmoreton
visit
to
george
had
been
twofold
in
the
first
place
lady
caroline
had
told
him
to
go
that
would
have
been
reason
enough
but
what
made
the
visit
imperative
was
an
unfortunate
accident
of
which
he
had
only
that
morning
been
made
aware
it
will
be
remembered
that
billie
dore
had
told
george
that
the
gardener
with
whom
she
had
become
so
friendly
had
taken
her
name
and
address
with
a
view
later
on
to
send
her
some
of
his
roses
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
this
information
had
been
written
was
now
lost
lord
marshmoreton
had
been
hunting
for
it
since
breakfast
without
avail
billie
dore
had
made
a
decided
impression
upon
lord
marshmoreton
she
belonged
to
a
type
which
he
had
never
before
encountered
and
it
was
one
which
he
had
found
more
than
agreeable
her
knowledge
of
roses
and
the
proper
feeling
which
she
manifested
towards
as
a
consolidated
the
earl
liking
for
her
never
in
his
memory
had
he
come
across
so
sensible
and
charming
a
girl
and
he
had
looked
forward
with
a
singular
intensity
to
meeting
her
again
and
now
some
too
zealous
housemaid
tidying
up
after
the
irritating
manner
of
her
species
had
destroyed
the
only
clue
to
her
identity
it
was
not
for
some
time
after
this
discovery
that
hope
dawned
again
for
lord
marshmoreton
only
after
he
had
given
up
the
search
for
the
missing
paper
as
fruitless
did
he
recall
that
it
was
in
george
company
that
billie
had
first
come
into
his
life
between
her
then
and
himself
george
was
the
only
link
it
was
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
getting
billie
name
and
address
from
george
that
he
had
come
to
the
cottage
and
now
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
touching
upon
the
subject
he
felt
a
little
embarrassed
when
you
visited
the
castle
he
said
when
you
visited
the
castle
last
thursday
said
george
helpfully
exactly
when
you
visited
the
castle
last
thursday
there
was
a
young
lady
with
you
not
realizing
that
the
subject
had
been
changed
george
was
under
the
impression
that
the
other
had
shifted
his
front
and
was
about
to
attack
him
from
another
angle
he
countered
what
seemed
to
him
an
insinuation
stoutly
we
merely
happened
to
meet
at
the
castle
she
came
there
quite
independently
of
me
lord
marshmoreton
looked
alarmed
you
did
know
her
he
said
anxiously
certainly
i
knew
her
she
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
but
if
you
are
hinting
not
at
all
rejoined
the
earl
profoundly
relieved
not
at
all
i
ask
merely
because
this
young
lady
with
whom
i
had
some
conversation
was
good
enough
to
give
me
her
name
and
address
she
too
happened
to
mistake
me
for
a
gardener
it
those
corduroy
trousers
murmured
george
in
extenuation
i
have
unfortunately
lost
them
you
can
always
get
another
pair
eh
i
say
you
can
always
get
another
pair
of
corduroy
trousers
i
have
not
lost
my
trousers
i
have
lost
the
young
lady
name
and
address
oh
i
promised
to
send
her
some
roses
she
will
be
expecting
them
that
odd
i
was
just
reading
a
letter
from
her
when
you
came
in
that
must
be
what
she
referring
to
when
she
says
you
see
dadda
the
old
dear
tell
him
not
to
forget
my
roses
i
read
it
three
times
and
could
make
any
sense
out
of
it
are
you
dadda
the
earl
smirked
she
did
address
me
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
as
dadda
then
the
message
is
for
you
a
very
quaint
and
charming
girl
what
is
her
name
and
where
can
i
find
her
her
name
billie
dore
billie
billie
billie
said
lord
marshmoreton
softly
i
had
better
write
it
down
and
her
address
i
do
know
her
private
address
but
you
could
always
reach
her
at
the
regal
theatre
ah
she
is
on
the
stage
yes
she
in
my
piece
the
girl
indeed
are
you
a
playwright
mr
bevan
good
lord
no
said
george
shocked
i
a
composer
very
interesting
and
you
met
miss
dore
through
her
being
in
this
play
of
yours
oh
no
i
knew
her
before
she
went
on
the
stage
she
was
a
stenographer
in
a
office
when
we
first
met
good
gracious
was
she
really
a
stenographer
yes
why
oh
ah
nothing
nothing
something
just
happened
to
come
to
my
mind
what
happened
to
come
into
lord
marshmoreton
mind
was
a
fleeting
vision
of
billie
installed
in
miss
alice
faraday
place
as
his
secretary
with
such
a
helper
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
work
on
that
infernal
family
history
which
was
now
such
a
bitter
toil
but
the
passed
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
dismiss
alice
in
the
hands
of
that
girl
he
was
as
putty
she
exercised
over
him
the
hypnotic
spell
a
exercises
over
his
little
playmates
we
have
been
pals
for
years
said
george
billie
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
a
charming
girl
she
would
give
her
last
nickel
to
anyone
that
asked
for
it
delightful
and
as
straight
as
a
string
no
one
ever
said
a
word
against
billie
no
she
may
go
out
to
lunch
and
supper
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
there
nothing
to
that
nothing
agreed
the
earl
warmly
girls
must
eat
they
do
you
ought
to
see
them
a
little
harmless
relaxation
after
the
fatigue
of
the
day
exactly
nothing
more
lord
marshmoreton
felt
more
drawn
than
ever
to
this
sensible
young
man
sensible
at
least
on
all
points
but
one
it
was
a
pity
they
could
not
see
eye
to
eye
on
what
was
and
what
was
not
suitable
in
the
matter
of
the
of
the
aristocracy
so
you
are
a
composer
mr
bevan
he
said
affably
yes
lord
marshmoreton
gave
a
little
sigh
it
a
long
time
since
i
went
to
see
a
musical
performance
more
than
twenty
years
when
i
was
up
at
oxford
and
for
some
years
afterwards
i
was
a
great
never
used
to
miss
a
first
night
at
the
gaiety
those
were
the
days
of
nellie
farren
and
kate
vaughan
florence
john
too
how
excellent
she
was
in
faust
up
to
date
but
we
missed
nellie
farren
meyer
lutz
was
the
gaiety
composer
then
but
a
good
deal
of
water
has
flowed
under
the
bridge
since
those
days
i
suppose
you
have
ever
heard
of
meyer
lutz
i
do
think
i
have
johnnie
toole
was
playing
a
piece
called
partners
not
a
good
play
and
the
yeoman
of
the
guard
had
just
been
produced
at
the
savoy
that
makes
it
seem
a
long
time
ago
does
it
well
i
must
take
up
all
your
time
bevan
i
am
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
this
little
talk
the
regal
theatre
i
think
you
said
is
where
your
piece
is
playing
i
shall
probably
be
going
to
london
shortly
i
hope
to
see
it
lord
marshmoreton
rose
as
regards
the
other
matter
there
is
no
hope
of
inducing
you
to
see
the
matter
in
the
right
light
we
seem
to
disagree
as
to
which
is
the
right
light
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
will
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
bevan
i
like
you
the
feeling
is
quite
mutual
but
i
do
want
you
as
a
and
dammit
exploded
lord
marshmoreton
i
wo
have
you
as
a
good
god
do
you
think
that
you
can
harry
and
assault
my
son
percy
in
the
heart
of
piccadilly
and
generally
make
yourself
a
damned
nuisance
and
then
settle
down
here
without
an
invitation
at
my
very
gates
and
expect
to
be
welcomed
into
the
bosom
of
the
family
if
i
were
a
young
man
i
thought
we
had
agreed
that
you
were
a
young
man
do
interrupt
me
i
only
said
i
heard
what
you
said
flattery
nothing
of
the
kind
truth
lord
marshmoreton
melted
he
smiled
young
idiot
we
agree
there
all
right
lord
marshmoreton
hesitated
then
with
a
rush
he
unbosomed
himself
and
made
his
own
position
on
the
matter
clear
i
know
what
you
be
saying
to
yourself
the
moment
my
back
is
turned
you
be
calling
me
a
stage
heavy
father
and
an
old
snob
and
a
number
of
other
things
do
interrupt
me
dammit
you
will
i
tell
you
and
you
be
wrong
i
do
think
the
marshmoretons
are
fenced
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
some
sort
of
divinity
my
sister
does
percy
does
but
percy
an
ass
if
ever
you
find
yourself
thinking
differently
from
my
son
percy
on
any
subject
congratulate
yourself
you
be
right
but
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
let
me
finish
if
i
were
the
only
person
concerned
i
would
stand
in
maud
way
whoever
she
wanted
to
marry
provided
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
likely
to
make
her
happy
but
i
not
there
my
sister
caroline
there
a
whole
crowd
of
silly
cackling
fools
my
sisters
my
all
the
whole
pack
of
them
if
i
did
oppose
maud
in
this
damned
infatuation
she
got
for
you
if
i
stood
by
and
let
her
marry
you
what
do
you
think
would
happen
to
me
i
never
have
a
peace
the
whole
gabbling
pack
of
them
would
be
at
me
saying
i
was
to
blame
there
would
be
arguments
discussions
family
councils
i
hate
arguments
i
loathe
discussions
family
councils
make
me
sick
i
a
peaceable
man
and
i
like
a
quiet
life
and
damme
i
going
to
have
it
so
there
the
thing
for
you
in
letters
of
one
syllable
i
do
object
to
you
personally
but
i
not
going
to
have
you
bothering
me
like
this
i
admit
freely
that
since
i
have
made
your
acquaintance
i
have
altered
the
unfavourable
opinion
i
had
formed
of
you
from
from
hearsay
exactly
the
same
with
me
said
george
you
ought
never
to
believe
what
people
tell
you
everyone
told
me
your
middle
name
was
nero
and
that
do
interrupt
me
i
was
i
was
just
pointing
out
be
quiet
i
say
i
have
changed
my
opinion
of
you
to
a
great
extent
i
mention
this
unofficially
as
a
matter
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
main
issue
for
as
regards
any
idea
you
may
have
of
inducing
me
to
agree
to
your
marrying
my
daughter
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
unalterably
opposed
to
any
such
thing
do
say
that
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
do
say
that
i
do
say
that
it
is
out
of
the
question
do
you
understand
very
well
then
good
morning
the
door
closed
lord
marshmoreton
walked
away
feeling
that
he
had
been
commendably
stern
george
filled
his
pipe
and
sat
smoking
thoughtfully
he
wondered
what
maud
was
doing
at
that
moment
maud
at
that
moment
was
greeting
her
brother
with
a
bright
smile
as
he
limped
downstairs
after
a
belated
shave
and
change
of
costume
oh
percy
dear
she
was
saying
i
had
quite
an
adventure
this
morning
an
awful
tramp
followed
me
for
miles
such
a
brute
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
had
to
ask
a
curate
in
the
next
village
to
drive
him
away
i
did
wish
i
had
had
you
there
to
protect
me
why
do
you
come
out
with
me
sometimes
when
i
take
a
country
walk
it
really
is
safe
for
me
to
be
alone
chapter
the
gift
of
hiding
private
emotion
and
keeping
up
appearances
before
strangers
is
not
as
many
suppose
entirely
a
product
of
our
modern
civilization
centuries
before
we
were
born
or
thought
of
there
was
a
widely
boy
in
sparta
who
even
went
so
far
as
to
let
a
fox
gnaw
his
tender
young
stomach
without
permitting
the
discomfort
inseparable
from
such
a
proceeding
to
interfere
with
either
his
facial
expression
or
his
flow
of
small
talk
historians
have
handed
it
down
that
even
in
the
later
stages
of
the
meal
the
polite
lad
continued
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
but
while
this
feat
may
be
said
to
have
established
a
record
never
subsequently
lowered
there
is
no
doubt
that
almost
every
day
in
modern
times
men
and
women
are
performing
similar
and
scarcely
less
impressive
miracles
of
of
all
the
qualities
which
belong
exclusively
to
man
and
are
not
shared
by
the
lower
animals
this
surely
is
the
one
which
marks
him
off
most
sharply
from
the
beasts
of
the
field
animals
care
nothing
about
keeping
up
appearances
observe
bertram
the
bull
when
things
are
not
going
just
as
he
could
wish
he
stamps
he
snorts
he
paws
the
ground
he
throws
back
his
head
and
bellows
he
is
upset
and
he
does
care
who
knows
it
instances
could
be
readily
multiplied
deposit
a
charge
of
shot
in
some
outlying
section
of
thomas
the
tiger
and
note
the
effect
irritate
wilfred
the
wasp
or
stand
behind
maud
the
mule
and
prod
her
with
a
pin
there
is
not
an
animal
on
the
list
who
has
even
a
rudimentary
sense
of
the
social
amenities
and
it
is
this
more
than
anything
else
which
should
make
us
proud
that
we
are
human
beings
on
a
loftier
plane
of
development
in
the
days
which
followed
lord
marshmoreton
visit
to
george
at
the
cottage
not
a
few
of
the
occupants
of
belpher
castle
had
their
mettle
sternly
tested
in
this
respect
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
record
that
not
one
of
them
failed
to
come
through
the
ordeal
with
success
the
general
public
as
represented
by
the
uncles
cousins
and
aunts
who
had
descended
on
the
place
to
help
lord
belpher
celebrate
his
had
not
a
notion
that
turmoil
lurked
behind
the
smooth
fronts
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
of
those
whom
they
met
in
the
course
of
the
daily
round
lord
belpher
for
example
though
he
limped
rather
painfully
showed
nothing
of
the
baffled
fury
which
was
reducing
his
weight
at
the
rate
of
ounces
a
day
his
uncle
francis
the
bishop
when
he
tackled
him
in
the
garden
on
the
subject
of
intemperance
for
uncle
francis
like
thousands
of
others
had
taken
it
for
granted
on
reading
the
report
of
the
encounter
with
the
policeman
and
subsequent
arrest
that
the
affair
had
been
the
result
of
a
drunken
outburst
had
no
inkling
of
the
volcanic
emotions
that
seethed
in
his
nephew
bosom
he
came
away
from
the
interview
indeed
feeling
that
the
boy
had
listened
attentively
and
with
a
becoming
regret
and
that
there
was
hope
for
him
after
all
provided
that
he
fought
the
impulse
he
little
knew
that
but
for
the
conventions
which
frown
on
the
practice
of
murdering
bishops
percy
would
gladly
have
strangled
him
with
his
bare
hands
and
jumped
upon
the
remains
lord
belpher
case
inasmuch
as
he
took
himself
extremely
seriously
and
was
not
one
of
those
who
can
extract
humour
even
from
their
own
misfortunes
was
perhaps
the
hardest
which
comes
under
our
notice
but
his
sister
maud
was
also
experiencing
mental
disquietude
of
no
mean
order
everything
had
gone
wrong
with
maud
barely
a
mile
separated
her
from
george
that
essential
link
in
her
chain
of
communication
with
geoffrey
raymond
but
so
thickly
did
it
bristle
with
obstacles
and
dangers
that
it
might
have
been
a
mile
of
no
man
land
twice
since
the
occasion
when
the
discovery
of
lord
marshmoreton
at
the
cottage
had
caused
her
to
abandon
her
purpose
of
going
in
and
explaining
everything
to
george
had
she
attempted
to
make
the
journey
and
each
time
some
trifling
maddening
accident
had
brought
about
failure
once
just
as
she
was
starting
her
aunt
augusta
had
insisted
on
joining
her
for
what
she
described
as
a
nice
long
walk
and
the
second
time
when
she
was
within
a
bare
hundred
yards
of
her
objective
some
sort
of
a
cousin
popped
out
from
nowhere
and
forced
his
loathsome
company
on
her
foiled
in
this
fashion
she
had
fallen
back
in
desperation
on
her
second
line
of
attack
she
had
written
a
note
to
george
explaining
the
whole
situation
in
good
clear
phrases
and
begging
him
as
a
man
of
proved
chivalry
to
help
her
it
had
taken
up
much
of
one
afternoon
this
note
for
it
was
not
easy
to
write
and
it
had
resulted
in
nothing
she
had
given
it
to
albert
to
deliver
and
albert
had
returned
the
gentleman
said
there
was
no
answer
no
answer
but
there
must
be
an
answer
no
answer
those
was
his
very
words
stoutly
maintained
the
boy
who
had
destroyed
the
letter
within
two
minutes
after
it
had
been
handed
to
him
he
had
not
even
bothered
to
read
it
a
deep
dangerous
dastardly
stripling
this
who
fought
to
win
and
only
to
win
the
ticket
marked
byng
was
in
his
pocket
and
in
his
ruthless
heart
a
firm
resolve
that
byng
and
no
other
should
have
the
benefit
of
his
assistance
maud
could
not
understand
it
that
is
to
say
she
resolutely
kept
herself
from
accepting
the
only
explanation
of
the
episode
that
seemed
possible
in
black
and
white
she
had
asked
george
to
go
to
london
and
see
geoffrey
and
arrange
for
the
passage
through
himself
as
a
sort
of
of
letters
between
geoffrey
and
herself
she
had
felt
from
the
first
that
such
a
request
should
be
made
by
her
in
person
and
not
through
the
medium
of
writing
but
surely
it
was
incredible
that
a
man
like
george
who
had
been
through
so
much
for
her
and
whose
only
reason
for
being
in
the
neighbourhood
was
to
help
her
could
have
coldly
refused
without
even
a
word
and
yet
what
else
was
she
to
think
now
more
than
ever
she
felt
alone
in
a
hostile
world
yet
to
her
guests
she
was
bright
and
entertaining
not
one
of
them
had
a
suspicion
that
her
life
was
not
one
of
pure
sunshine
albert
i
am
happy
to
say
was
thoroughly
miserable
the
little
brute
was
suffering
torments
he
was
showering
anonymous
advice
to
the
lovelorn
on
reggie
byng
excellent
stuff
culled
from
the
pages
of
weekly
papers
of
which
there
was
a
pile
in
the
room
the
property
of
a
sentimental
lady
maid
and
nothing
seemed
to
come
of
it
every
day
sometimes
twice
and
thrice
a
day
he
would
leave
on
reggie
significant
notes
similar
in
tone
to
the
one
which
he
had
placed
there
on
the
night
of
the
ball
but
for
all
the
effect
they
appeared
to
exercise
on
their
recipient
they
might
have
been
blank
pages
the
choicest
quotations
from
the
works
of
such
established
writers
as
aunt
charlotte
of
and
doctor
cupid
the
of
home
chat
expended
themselves
fruitlessly
on
reggie
as
far
as
albert
could
ascertain
and
he
was
one
of
those
boys
who
ascertain
practically
everything
within
a
radius
of
miles
reggie
positively
avoided
maud
society
and
this
after
reading
doctor
cupid
invaluable
tip
about
seeking
her
company
on
all
occasions
and
the
dictum
of
aunt
charlotte
to
the
effect
that
many
a
wooer
has
won
his
lady
by
being
persistent
albert
spelled
it
persistuent
but
the
effect
is
the
same
and
rendering
himself
indispensable
by
constant
little
attentions
so
far
from
rendering
himself
indispensable
to
maud
by
constant
little
attentions
reggie
to
the
disgust
of
his
backer
and
supporter
seemed
to
spend
most
of
his
time
with
alice
faraday
on
three
separate
occasions
had
albert
been
revolted
by
the
sight
of
his
protege
in
close
association
with
the
faraday
girl
once
in
a
boat
on
the
lake
and
twice
in
his
grey
car
it
was
enough
to
break
a
boy
heart
and
it
completely
spoiled
appetite
a
phenomenon
attributed
i
am
glad
to
say
in
the
servants
hall
to
reaction
from
recent
excesses
the
moment
when
keggs
the
butler
called
him
a
greedy
little
pig
and
hoped
it
would
be
a
lesson
to
him
not
to
stuff
himself
at
all
hours
with
stolen
cakes
was
a
bitter
moment
for
albert
it
is
a
relief
to
turn
from
the
contemplation
of
these
tortured
souls
to
the
pleasanter
picture
presented
by
lord
marshmoreton
here
undeniably
we
have
a
man
without
a
secret
sorrow
a
man
at
peace
with
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
since
his
visit
to
george
a
second
youth
seems
to
have
come
upon
lord
marshmoreton
he
works
in
his
with
a
new
vim
whistling
or
even
singing
to
himself
stray
gay
snatches
of
melodies
popular
in
the
hear
him
now
as
he
toils
he
has
a
long
in
his
hand
and
he
is
sending
up
the
in
slug
circles
with
a
devastating
rapidity
boom
and
the
boom
is
a
as
it
rings
softly
out
on
the
pleasant
spring
air
another
stout
slug
has
made
the
great
change
it
is
peculiar
this
gaiety
it
gives
one
to
think
others
have
noticed
it
his
lordship
valet
amongst
them
i
give
you
my
honest
word
keggs
says
the
valet
awed
this
very
morning
i
the
old
devil
in
barth
chirruping
away
like
a
blooming
linnet
lor
says
keggs
properly
impressed
and
only
last
night
gave
me
a
box
of
cigars
and
said
i
was
a
good
faithful
feller
i
tell
you
there
somethin
happened
to
the
old
buster
you
mark
my
words
chapter
over
this
complex
situation
the
mind
of
keggs
the
butler
played
like
a
searchlight
keggs
was
a
man
of
discernment
and
sagacity
he
had
instinct
and
reasoning
power
instinct
told
him
that
maud
all
unsuspecting
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
albert
attitude
toward
her
romance
would
have
continued
to
use
the
boy
as
a
link
between
herself
and
george
and
reason
added
to
an
intimate
knowledge
of
albert
enabled
him
to
see
that
the
latter
must
inevitably
have
betrayed
her
trust
he
was
prepared
to
bet
a
hundred
pounds
that
albert
had
been
given
letters
to
deliver
and
had
destroyed
them
so
much
was
clear
to
keggs
it
only
remained
to
settle
on
some
plan
of
action
which
would
the
broken
connection
keggs
did
not
conceal
a
tender
heart
beneath
a
rugged
exterior
he
did
not
mourn
over
the
picture
of
two
loving
fellow
human
beings
separated
by
a
misunderstanding
but
he
did
want
to
win
that
sweepstake
his
position
of
course
was
delicate
he
could
not
go
to
maud
and
beg
her
to
confide
in
him
maud
would
not
understand
his
motives
and
might
leap
to
the
not
unjustifiable
conclusion
that
he
had
been
at
the
sherry
no
men
were
easier
to
handle
than
women
as
soon
as
his
duties
would
permit
and
in
the
present
crowded
condition
of
the
house
they
were
arduous
he
set
out
for
george
cottage
i
trust
i
do
not
disturb
or
interrupt
you
sir
he
said
beaming
in
the
doorway
like
a
benevolent
high
priest
he
had
doffed
his
professional
manner
of
austere
disapproval
as
was
his
custom
in
moments
of
leisure
not
at
all
replied
george
puzzled
was
there
anything
there
was
sir
come
along
in
and
sit
down
i
would
not
take
the
liberty
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
sir
i
would
prefer
to
remain
standing
there
was
a
moment
of
uncomfortable
silence
uncomfortable
that
is
to
say
on
the
part
of
george
who
was
wondering
if
the
butler
remembered
having
engaged
him
as
a
waiter
only
a
few
nights
back
keggs
himself
was
at
his
ease
few
things
ruffled
this
man
fine
day
said
george
extremely
sir
but
for
the
rain
oh
is
it
raining
sharp
downpour
sir
good
for
the
crops
said
george
so
one
would
be
disposed
to
imagine
sir
silence
fell
again
the
rain
dripped
from
the
eaves
if
i
might
speak
freely
sir
said
keggs
sure
shoot
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
mean
yes
go
ahead
the
butler
cleared
his
throat
might
i
begin
by
remarking
that
your
little
affair
of
the
if
i
may
use
the
expression
is
no
secret
in
the
servants
i
no
wish
to
seem
to
be
taking
a
liberty
or
presuming
but
i
should
like
to
intimate
that
the
servants
is
aware
of
the
facts
you
do
have
to
tell
me
that
said
george
coldly
i
know
all
about
the
sweepstake
a
flicker
of
embarrassment
passed
over
the
butler
large
smooth
face
passed
and
was
gone
i
did
not
know
that
you
been
apprised
of
that
little
matter
sir
but
you
will
doubtless
understand
and
appreciate
our
point
of
view
a
little
sporting
flutter
nothing
more
designed
to
halleviate
the
monotony
of
life
in
the
country
oh
do
apologize
said
george
and
was
reminded
of
a
point
which
had
exercised
him
a
little
from
time
to
time
since
his
vigil
on
the
balcony
by
the
way
if
it
is
giving
away
secrets
who
drew
plummer
sir
which
of
you
drew
a
man
named
plummer
in
the
sweep
i
rather
fancy
sir
keggs
brow
wrinkled
in
thought
i
rather
fancy
it
was
one
of
the
visiting
gentlemen
gentlemen
i
gave
the
point
but
slight
attention
at
the
time
i
did
not
fancy
plummer
chances
it
seemed
to
me
that
plummer
was
a
negligible
quantity
your
knowledge
of
form
was
sound
plummer
out
indeed
sir
an
amiable
young
gentleman
but
lacking
in
many
of
the
essential
qualities
perhaps
he
struck
you
that
way
sir
i
never
met
him
nearly
but
not
quite
it
entered
my
mind
that
you
might
possibly
have
encountered
plummer
on
the
night
of
the
ball
sir
ah
i
was
wondering
if
you
remembered
me
i
remember
you
perfectly
sir
and
it
was
the
fact
that
we
had
already
met
in
what
one
might
almost
term
a
social
way
that
emboldened
me
to
come
today
and
offer
you
my
services
as
a
hintermediary
should
you
feel
disposed
to
avail
yourself
of
them
george
was
puzzled
your
services
precisely
sir
i
fancy
i
am
in
a
position
to
lend
you
what
might
be
termed
an
but
that
remarkably
altruistic
of
you
is
it
sir
i
say
that
is
very
generous
of
you
are
you
forgetting
that
you
drew
mr
byng
the
butler
smiled
indulgently
you
are
not
quite
abreast
of
the
progress
of
events
sir
since
the
original
drawing
of
names
there
been
a
trifling
hadjustment
the
boy
albert
now
byng
and
i
you
sir
a
little
amicable
arrangement
informally
conducted
in
the
scullery
on
the
night
of
the
ball
amicable
on
my
part
entirely
so
george
began
to
understand
certain
things
that
had
been
perplexing
to
him
then
all
this
while
precisely
sir
all
this
while
ladyship
under
the
impression
that
the
boy
albert
was
devoted
to
cause
has
no
doubt
been
placing
a
misguided
confidence
in
the
little
blighter
said
keggs
abandoning
for
a
moment
his
company
manners
and
permitting
vehemence
to
take
the
place
of
polish
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
expression
sir
he
added
gracefully
it
escaped
me
inadvertently
you
think
that
lady
maud
gave
albert
a
letter
to
give
to
me
and
that
he
destroyed
it
such
i
should
imagine
must
undoubtedly
have
been
the
case
the
boy
no
scruples
no
scruples
whatsoever
good
lord
i
appreciate
your
consternation
sir
that
must
be
exactly
what
has
happened
to
my
way
of
thinking
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
ventured
to
come
in
the
that
i
might
be
hinstrumental
in
arranging
a
meeting
the
strong
distaste
which
george
had
had
for
plotting
with
this
overfed
menial
began
to
wane
it
might
be
undignified
he
told
himself
but
it
was
undeniably
practical
and
after
all
a
man
who
has
plotted
with
has
little
dignity
to
lose
by
plotting
with
butlers
he
brightened
up
if
it
meant
seeing
maud
again
he
was
prepared
to
waive
the
decencies
what
do
you
suggest
he
said
it
being
a
rainy
evening
and
everyone
indoors
playing
games
and
what
not
keggs
was
amiably
tolerant
of
the
recreations
of
the
aristocracy
you
would
experience
little
chance
of
a
hinterruption
were
you
to
proceed
to
the
lane
outside
the
heast
entrance
of
the
castle
grounds
and
wait
there
you
will
find
in
the
field
at
the
roadside
a
small
disused
barn
only
a
short
way
from
the
gates
where
you
would
be
sheltered
from
the
rain
in
the
meantime
i
would
hinform
ladyship
of
your
movements
and
no
doubt
it
would
be
possible
for
to
slip
off
it
sounds
all
right
it
is
all
right
sir
the
chances
of
a
hinterruption
may
be
said
to
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
shall
we
say
in
one
hour
time
very
well
then
i
will
wish
you
good
evening
sir
thank
you
sir
i
am
glad
to
been
of
assistance
he
withdrew
as
he
had
come
with
a
large
impressiveness
the
room
seemed
very
empty
without
him
george
with
trembling
fingers
began
to
put
on
a
pair
of
thick
boots
for
some
minutes
after
he
had
set
foot
outside
the
door
of
the
cottage
george
was
inclined
to
revile
the
weather
for
having
played
him
false
on
this
evening
of
all
evenings
he
felt
the
elements
should
so
to
speak
have
rallied
round
and
done
their
bit
the
air
should
have
been
soft
and
clear
and
scented
there
should
have
been
an
afterglow
of
sunset
in
the
sky
to
light
him
on
his
way
instead
the
air
was
full
of
that
peculiar
smell
of
hopeless
dampness
which
comes
at
the
end
of
a
wet
english
day
the
sky
was
leaden
the
rain
hissed
down
in
a
steady
flow
whispering
of
mud
and
desolation
making
a
dreary
morass
of
the
lane
through
which
he
tramped
a
curious
sense
of
foreboding
came
upon
george
it
was
as
if
some
voice
of
the
night
had
murmured
maliciously
in
his
ear
a
hint
of
troubles
to
come
he
felt
oddly
nervous
as
he
entered
the
barn
the
barn
was
both
dark
and
dismal
in
one
of
the
dark
corners
an
intermittent
dripping
betrayed
the
presence
of
a
gap
in
its
ancient
roof
a
rat
scurried
across
the
floor
the
dripping
stopped
and
began
again
george
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
his
watch
he
was
early
another
ten
minutes
must
elapse
before
he
could
hope
for
her
arrival
he
sat
down
on
a
broken
wagon
which
lay
on
its
side
against
one
of
the
walls
depression
returned
it
was
impossible
to
fight
against
it
in
this
beast
of
a
barn
the
place
was
like
a
sepulchre
no
one
but
a
fool
of
a
butler
would
have
suggested
it
as
a
he
wondered
irritably
why
places
like
this
were
allowed
to
get
into
this
condition
if
people
wanted
a
barn
earnestly
enough
to
take
the
trouble
of
building
one
why
was
it
not
worth
while
to
keep
the
thing
in
proper
repair
waste
and
futility
that
was
what
it
was
that
was
what
everything
was
if
you
came
down
to
it
sitting
here
for
instance
was
a
futile
waste
of
time
she
would
come
there
were
a
dozen
reasons
why
she
should
not
come
so
what
was
the
use
of
his
courting
rheumatism
by
waiting
in
this
morgue
of
dead
agricultural
ambitions
none
whatever
george
went
on
waiting
and
what
an
awful
place
to
expect
her
to
come
to
if
by
some
miracle
she
did
come
where
she
would
be
stifled
by
the
smell
of
mouldy
hay
damped
by
raindrops
and
reflected
george
gloomily
as
there
was
another
scurry
and
scutter
along
the
unseen
floor
gnawed
by
rats
you
could
not
expect
a
girl
accustomed
to
all
the
comforts
of
a
home
to
be
bright
and
sunny
with
a
platoon
of
rats
crawling
all
over
her
the
grey
oblong
that
was
the
doorway
suddenly
darkened
mr
bevan
george
sprang
up
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
every
nerve
in
his
body
danced
in
mad
exhilaration
he
was
another
man
depression
fell
from
him
like
a
garment
he
perceived
that
he
had
misjudged
all
sorts
of
things
the
evening
for
instance
was
a
splendid
evening
not
one
of
those
awful
dry
baking
evenings
which
make
you
feel
you
ca
breathe
but
pleasantly
moist
and
full
of
a
delightfully
musical
patter
of
rain
and
the
barn
he
had
been
all
wrong
about
the
barn
it
was
a
great
little
place
comfortable
airy
and
cheerful
what
could
be
more
invigorating
than
that
smell
of
hay
even
the
rats
he
felt
must
be
pretty
decent
rats
when
you
came
to
know
them
i
here
maud
advanced
quickly
his
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
murk
and
he
could
see
her
dimly
the
smell
of
her
damp
raincoat
came
to
him
like
a
breath
of
ozone
he
could
even
see
her
eyes
shining
in
the
darkness
so
close
was
she
to
him
i
hope
you
not
been
waiting
long
george
heart
was
thundering
against
his
ribs
he
could
scarcely
speak
he
contrived
to
emit
a
no
i
did
think
at
first
i
could
get
away
i
had
to
she
broke
off
with
a
cry
the
rat
fond
of
exercise
like
all
rats
had
made
another
of
its
excitable
sprints
across
the
floor
a
hand
clutched
nervously
at
george
arm
found
it
and
held
it
and
at
the
touch
the
last
small
fragment
of
george
fled
from
him
the
world
became
vague
and
unreal
there
remained
of
it
but
one
solid
fact
the
fact
that
maud
was
in
his
arms
and
that
he
was
saying
a
number
of
things
very
rapidly
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
belong
to
somebody
he
had
never
met
before
chapter
with
a
shock
of
dismay
so
abrupt
and
overwhelming
that
it
was
like
a
physical
injury
george
became
aware
that
something
was
wrong
even
as
he
gripped
her
maud
had
stiffened
with
a
sharp
cry
and
now
she
was
struggling
trying
to
wrench
herself
free
she
broke
away
from
him
he
could
hear
her
breathing
hard
you
you
she
gulped
maud
how
dare
you
there
was
a
pause
that
seemed
to
george
to
stretch
on
and
on
endlessly
the
rain
pattered
on
the
leaky
roof
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
dog
howled
dismally
the
darkness
pressed
down
like
a
blanket
stifling
thought
good
night
mr
bevan
her
voice
was
ice
i
did
think
you
were
that
kind
of
man
she
was
moving
toward
the
door
and
as
she
reached
it
stupor
left
him
he
came
back
to
life
with
a
jerk
shaking
from
head
to
foot
all
his
varied
emotions
had
become
one
emotion
a
cold
fury
stop
maud
stopped
her
chin
was
tilted
and
she
was
wasting
a
baleful
glare
on
the
darkness
well
what
is
it
her
tone
increased
george
wrath
the
injustice
of
it
made
him
dizzy
at
that
moment
he
hated
her
he
was
the
injured
party
it
was
he
not
she
that
had
been
deceived
and
made
a
fool
of
i
want
to
say
something
before
you
go
i
think
we
had
better
say
no
more
about
it
by
the
exercise
of
supreme
george
kept
himself
from
speaking
until
he
could
choose
milder
words
than
those
that
rushed
to
his
lips
i
think
we
will
he
said
between
his
teeth
maud
anger
became
tinged
with
surprise
now
that
the
first
shock
of
the
wretched
episode
was
over
the
calmer
half
of
her
mind
was
endeavouring
to
soothe
the
infuriated
half
by
urging
that
behaviour
had
been
but
a
momentary
lapse
and
that
a
man
may
lose
his
head
for
one
wild
instant
and
yet
remain
fundamentally
a
gentleman
and
a
friend
she
had
begun
to
remind
herself
that
this
man
had
helped
her
once
in
trouble
and
only
a
day
or
two
before
had
actually
risked
his
life
to
save
her
from
embarrassment
when
she
heard
him
call
to
her
to
stop
she
supposed
that
his
better
feelings
had
reasserted
themselves
and
she
had
prepared
herself
to
receive
with
dignity
a
broken
stammered
apology
but
the
voice
that
had
just
spoken
with
a
crisp
biting
intensity
was
not
the
voice
of
remorse
it
was
a
very
angry
man
not
a
penitent
one
who
was
commanding
not
begging
her
to
stop
and
listen
to
him
well
she
said
again
more
coldly
this
time
she
was
quite
unable
to
understand
this
attitude
of
his
she
was
the
injured
party
it
was
she
not
he
who
had
trusted
and
been
betrayed
i
should
like
to
explain
please
do
not
apologize
george
ground
his
teeth
in
the
gloom
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
apologizing
i
said
i
would
like
to
explain
when
i
have
finished
explaining
you
can
go
i
shall
go
when
i
please
flared
maud
this
man
was
intolerable
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
there
will
be
no
repetition
of
the
incident
maud
was
outraged
by
this
monstrous
misinterpretation
of
her
words
i
am
not
afraid
then
perhaps
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
listen
i
wo
detain
you
long
my
explanation
is
quite
simple
i
have
been
made
a
fool
of
i
seem
to
be
in
the
position
of
the
tinker
in
the
play
whom
everybody
conspired
to
delude
into
the
belief
that
he
was
a
king
first
a
friend
of
yours
byng
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
you
had
confided
to
him
that
you
loved
me
maud
gasped
either
this
man
was
mad
or
reggie
byng
was
she
choose
the
politer
solution
reggie
byng
must
have
lost
his
senses
so
i
supposed
at
least
i
imagined
that
he
must
be
mistaken
but
a
man
in
love
is
an
optimistic
fool
of
course
and
i
had
loved
you
ever
since
you
got
into
my
cab
that
morning
what
so
after
a
while
proceeded
george
ignoring
the
interruption
i
almost
persuaded
myself
that
miracles
could
still
happen
and
that
what
byng
said
was
true
and
when
your
father
called
on
me
and
told
me
the
very
same
thing
i
was
convinced
it
seemed
incredible
but
i
had
to
believe
it
now
it
seems
that
for
some
inscrutable
reason
both
byng
and
your
father
were
making
a
fool
of
me
that
all
good
night
maud
reply
was
the
last
which
george
or
any
man
would
have
expected
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
she
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
it
was
the
laughter
of
nerves
but
to
george
ears
it
had
the
ring
of
genuine
amusement
i
glad
you
find
my
story
entertaining
he
said
dryly
he
was
convinced
now
that
he
loathed
this
girl
and
that
all
he
desired
was
to
see
her
go
out
of
his
life
for
ever
later
no
doubt
the
funny
side
of
it
will
hit
me
just
at
present
my
sense
of
humour
is
rather
dormant
maud
gave
a
little
cry
i
sorry
i
so
sorry
bevan
it
was
that
it
was
that
at
all
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
do
know
why
i
laughed
it
certainly
was
because
i
thought
it
funny
it
tragic
there
been
a
dreadful
mistake
i
noticed
that
said
george
bitterly
the
darkness
began
to
afflict
his
nerves
i
wish
to
god
we
had
some
light
the
glare
of
a
smote
upon
him
i
brought
it
to
see
my
way
back
with
said
maud
in
a
curious
small
voice
it
very
dark
across
the
fields
i
did
light
it
before
because
i
was
afraid
somebody
might
see
she
came
towards
him
holding
the
torch
over
her
head
the
beam
showed
her
face
troubled
and
sympathetic
and
at
the
sight
all
george
resentment
left
him
there
were
mysteries
here
beyond
his
unravelling
but
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
this
girl
was
not
to
blame
she
was
a
thoroughbred
as
straight
as
a
wand
she
was
pure
gold
i
came
here
to
tell
you
everything
she
said
she
placed
the
torch
on
the
so
that
its
ray
fell
in
a
pool
of
light
on
the
ground
between
them
i
do
it
now
only
only
it
is
so
easy
now
bevan
there
a
man
there
a
man
that
father
and
reggie
byng
mistook
they
thought
you
see
they
knew
it
was
you
that
i
was
with
that
day
in
the
cab
and
so
they
naturally
thought
when
you
came
down
here
that
you
were
the
man
i
had
gone
to
meet
that
day
the
man
i
i
the
man
you
love
yes
said
maud
in
a
small
voice
and
there
was
silence
again
george
could
feel
nothing
but
sympathy
it
mastered
other
emotion
in
him
even
the
grey
despair
that
had
come
her
words
he
could
feel
all
that
she
was
feeling
tell
me
all
about
it
he
said
i
met
him
in
wales
last
year
maud
voice
was
a
whisper
the
family
found
out
and
i
was
hurried
back
here
and
have
been
here
ever
since
that
day
when
i
met
you
i
had
managed
to
slip
away
from
home
i
had
found
out
that
he
was
in
london
and
i
was
going
to
meet
him
then
i
saw
percy
and
got
into
your
cab
it
all
been
a
horrible
mistake
i
sorry
i
see
said
george
thoughtfully
i
see
his
heart
ached
like
a
living
wound
she
had
told
so
little
and
he
could
guess
so
much
this
unknown
man
who
had
triumphed
seemed
to
sneer
scornfully
at
him
from
the
shadows
i
sorry
said
maud
again
you
must
feel
like
that
how
can
i
help
you
that
the
point
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
but
i
ca
ask
you
now
of
course
you
can
why
not
why
oh
i
could
george
managed
to
laugh
it
was
a
laugh
that
did
not
sound
convincing
even
to
himself
but
it
served
that
morbid
he
said
be
sensible
you
need
help
and
i
may
be
able
to
give
it
surely
a
man
is
barred
for
ever
from
doing
you
a
service
just
because
he
happens
to
love
you
suppose
you
were
drowning
and
plummer
was
the
only
swimmer
within
call
you
let
him
rescue
you
plummer
what
do
you
mean
you
not
forgotten
that
i
was
a
reluctant
to
his
recent
proposal
of
marriage
maud
uttered
an
exclamation
i
never
asked
how
terrible
of
me
were
you
much
hurt
hurt
george
could
not
follow
her
that
night
when
you
were
on
the
balcony
and
oh
george
understood
oh
no
hardly
at
all
a
few
scratches
i
scraped
my
hands
a
little
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
do
said
maud
her
admiration
glowing
for
a
man
who
could
treat
such
a
leap
so
lightly
she
had
always
had
a
private
theory
that
lord
leonard
after
performing
the
same
feat
had
bragged
about
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life
no
no
nothing
said
george
who
had
since
wondered
why
he
had
ever
made
such
a
about
climbing
up
a
perfectly
stout
sheet
it
was
splendid
george
blushed
we
are
wandering
from
the
main
theme
he
said
i
want
to
help
you
i
came
here
at
enormous
expense
to
help
you
how
can
i
do
it
maud
hesitated
i
think
you
may
be
offended
at
my
asking
such
a
thing
you
need
you
see
the
whole
trouble
is
that
i
ca
get
in
touch
with
geoffrey
he
in
london
and
i
here
and
any
chance
i
might
have
of
getting
to
london
vanished
that
day
i
met
you
when
percy
saw
me
in
piccadilly
how
did
your
people
find
out
it
was
you
they
asked
me
straight
out
and
you
owned
up
i
had
to
i
could
tell
them
a
direct
lie
george
thrilled
this
was
the
girl
he
had
had
doubts
of
so
than
it
was
worse
then
ever
continued
maud
i
dare
risk
writing
to
geoffrey
and
having
the
letter
intercepted
i
was
wondering
i
had
the
idea
almost
as
soon
as
i
found
that
you
had
come
here
you
want
me
to
take
a
letter
from
you
and
see
that
it
reaches
him
and
then
he
can
write
back
to
my
address
and
i
can
smuggle
the
letter
to
you
that
exactly
what
i
do
want
but
i
almost
did
like
to
ask
why
not
i
be
delighted
to
do
it
i
so
grateful
why
it
nothing
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ask
me
to
look
in
on
your
brother
and
smash
another
of
his
hats
maud
laughed
delightedly
the
whole
tension
of
the
situation
had
been
eased
for
her
more
and
more
she
found
herself
liking
george
yet
deep
down
in
her
she
realized
with
a
pang
that
for
him
there
had
been
no
easing
of
the
situation
she
was
sad
for
george
the
plummers
of
this
world
she
had
consigned
to
what
they
declared
would
be
perpetual
sorrow
with
scarcely
a
twinge
of
regret
but
george
was
different
poor
percy
she
said
i
do
suppose
he
ever
get
over
it
he
will
have
other
hats
but
it
wo
be
the
same
she
came
back
to
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
bevan
i
wonder
if
you
would
do
just
a
little
more
for
me
if
it
is
criminal
or
for
that
matter
if
it
is
could
you
go
to
geoffrey
and
see
him
and
tell
him
all
about
me
and
and
come
back
and
tell
me
how
he
looks
and
what
he
said
and
and
so
on
certainly
what
is
his
name
and
where
do
i
find
him
i
never
told
you
how
stupid
of
me
his
name
is
geoffrey
raymond
and
he
lives
with
his
uncle
wilbur
raymond
at
belgrave
square
i
go
to
him
tomorrow
thank
you
ever
so
much
george
got
up
the
movement
seemed
to
put
him
in
touch
with
the
outer
world
he
noticed
that
the
rain
had
stopped
and
that
stars
had
climbed
into
the
oblong
of
the
doorway
he
had
an
impression
that
he
had
been
in
the
barn
a
very
long
time
and
confirmed
this
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
though
the
watch
he
felt
understated
the
facts
by
the
length
of
several
centuries
he
was
abstaining
from
too
close
an
examination
of
his
emotions
from
a
prudent
feeling
that
he
was
going
to
suffer
soon
enough
without
assistance
from
himself
i
think
you
had
better
be
going
back
he
said
it
rather
late
they
may
be
missing
you
maud
laughed
happily
i
do
mind
now
what
they
do
but
i
suppose
dinners
must
be
dressed
for
whatever
happens
they
moved
together
to
the
door
what
a
lovely
night
after
all
i
never
thought
the
rain
would
stop
in
this
world
it
like
when
you
unhappy
and
think
it
going
on
for
ever
yes
said
george
maud
held
out
her
hand
good
night
mr
bevan
good
night
he
wondered
if
there
would
be
any
allusion
to
the
earlier
passages
of
their
interview
there
was
none
maud
was
of
the
class
whose
education
consists
mainly
of
a
training
in
the
delicate
ignoring
of
delicate
situations
then
you
will
go
and
see
geoffrey
tomorrow
thank
you
ever
so
much
not
at
all
george
admired
her
the
little
touch
of
formality
which
she
had
contrived
to
impart
to
the
conversation
struck
just
the
right
note
created
just
the
atmosphere
which
would
enable
them
to
part
without
weighing
too
heavily
on
the
deeper
aspect
of
that
parting
you
a
real
friend
mr
bevan
watch
me
prove
it
well
i
must
rush
i
suppose
good
night
good
night
she
moved
off
quickly
across
the
field
darkness
covered
her
the
dog
in
the
distance
had
begun
to
howl
again
he
had
his
troubles
too
chapter
trouble
sharpens
the
vision
in
our
moments
of
distress
we
can
see
clearly
that
what
is
wrong
with
this
world
of
ours
is
the
fact
that
misery
loves
company
and
seldom
gets
it
toothache
is
an
unpleasant
ailment
but
if
toothache
were
a
natural
condition
of
life
if
all
mankind
were
afflicted
with
toothache
at
birth
we
should
not
notice
it
it
is
the
freedom
from
aching
teeth
of
all
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
that
emphasizes
the
agony
and
as
with
toothache
so
with
trouble
until
our
private
affairs
go
wrong
we
never
realize
how
bubbling
over
with
happiness
the
bulk
of
mankind
seems
to
be
our
aching
heart
is
apparently
nothing
but
a
desert
island
in
an
ocean
of
joy
george
waking
next
morning
with
a
heavy
heart
made
this
discovery
before
the
day
was
an
hour
old
the
sun
was
shining
and
birds
sang
merrily
but
this
did
not
disturb
him
nature
is
ever
callous
to
human
woes
laughing
while
we
weep
and
we
grow
to
take
her
callousness
for
granted
what
jarred
upon
george
was
the
infernal
cheerfulness
of
his
fellow
men
they
seemed
to
be
doing
it
on
purpose
triumphing
over
him
glorying
in
the
fact
that
however
fate
might
have
shattered
him
they
were
all
right
people
were
happy
who
had
never
been
happy
before
platt
for
instance
a
grey
depressed
woman
of
middle
age
she
had
seemed
hitherto
to
have
few
pleasures
beyond
breaking
dishes
and
relating
the
symptoms
of
sick
neighbours
who
were
not
expected
to
live
through
the
week
she
now
sang
george
could
hear
her
as
she
prepared
his
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
at
first
he
had
had
a
hope
that
she
was
moaning
with
pain
but
this
was
dispelled
when
he
had
finished
his
toilet
and
proceeded
downstairs
the
sounds
she
emitted
suggested
anguish
but
the
words
when
he
was
able
to
distinguish
them
told
another
story
incredible
as
it
might
seem
on
this
particular
morning
platt
had
elected
to
be
what
she
was
singing
sounded
like
a
dirge
but
actually
it
was
stop
your
tickling
jock
and
later
when
she
brought
george
his
coffee
and
eggs
she
spent
a
full
ten
minutes
prattling
as
he
tried
to
read
his
paper
pointing
out
to
him
a
number
of
merry
murders
and
sprightly
suicides
which
otherwise
he
might
have
missed
the
woman
went
out
of
her
way
to
show
him
that
for
her
if
not
for
less
fortunate
people
god
this
morning
was
in
his
heaven
and
all
was
right
in
the
world
two
tramps
of
supernatural
exuberance
called
at
the
cottage
shortly
after
breakfast
to
ask
george
whom
they
had
never
even
consulted
about
their
marriages
to
help
support
their
wives
and
children
nothing
could
have
been
more
and
than
the
demeanour
of
these
men
and
then
reggie
byng
arrived
in
his
grey
racing
car
more
cheerful
than
any
of
them
fate
could
not
have
mocked
george
more
subtly
a
sorrow
crown
of
sorrow
is
remembering
happier
things
and
the
sight
of
reggie
in
that
room
reminded
him
that
on
the
last
occasion
when
they
had
talked
together
across
this
same
table
it
was
he
who
had
been
in
a
fool
paradise
and
reggie
who
had
borne
a
weight
of
care
reggie
this
morning
was
brighter
than
the
shining
sun
and
gayer
than
the
carolling
birds
topping
morning
is
it
observed
reggie
the
sunshine
the
birds
the
absolute
of
everything
and
so
forth
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
feel
like
a
george
who
felt
older
than
this
by
some
years
groaned
in
spirit
this
was
more
than
man
was
meant
to
bear
i
say
continued
reggie
absently
reaching
out
for
a
slice
of
bread
and
smearing
it
with
marmalade
this
business
of
marriage
now
and
all
that
species
of
rot
what
i
mean
to
say
is
what
about
it
not
a
bad
scheme
taking
it
by
and
large
or
do
you
think
so
george
writhed
the
knife
twisted
in
the
wound
surely
it
was
bad
enough
to
see
a
happy
man
eating
bread
and
marmalade
without
having
to
listen
to
him
talking
about
marriage
well
anyhow
be
that
as
it
may
said
reggie
biting
jovially
and
speaking
in
a
thick
but
joyous
voice
i
getting
married
today
and
chance
it
this
morning
this
very
morning
i
leap
off
the
dock
george
was
startled
out
of
his
despondency
what
absolutely
laddie
george
remembered
the
conventions
i
congratulate
you
thanks
old
man
and
not
without
reason
i
the
luckiest
fellow
alive
i
hardly
knew
i
was
alive
till
now
is
this
rather
sudden
reggie
looked
a
trifle
furtive
his
manner
became
that
of
a
conspirator
i
should
jolly
well
say
it
is
sudden
it
got
to
be
sudden
dashed
sudden
and
deuced
secret
if
the
mater
were
to
hear
of
it
there
no
doubt
whatever
she
would
form
a
flying
wedge
and
bust
up
the
proceedings
with
no
uncertain
voice
you
see
laddie
it
miss
faraday
i
marrying
and
the
mater
dear
old
soul
has
other
ideas
for
reginald
life
a
rummy
thing
is
it
what
i
mean
to
say
is
it
rummy
do
you
know
and
all
that
very
agreed
george
who
have
thought
a
week
ago
that
i
be
sitting
in
this
jolly
old
chair
asking
you
to
be
my
best
man
why
a
week
ago
i
know
you
and
if
anybody
had
told
me
alice
faraday
was
going
to
marry
me
i
have
given
one
of
those
hollow
mirthless
laughs
do
you
want
me
to
be
your
best
man
absolutely
if
you
do
mind
you
see
said
reggie
confidentially
it
like
this
i
got
lots
of
pals
of
course
buzzing
about
all
over
london
and
its
outskirts
who
be
glad
enough
to
rally
round
and
join
the
but
you
know
how
it
is
their
maters
are
all
pals
of
my
mater
and
i
do
want
to
get
them
into
trouble
for
aiding
and
abetting
my
little
show
if
you
understand
what
i
mean
now
you
different
you
do
know
the
mater
so
it
does
matter
to
you
if
she
rolls
around
and
puts
the
curse
of
the
byngs
on
you
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
besides
i
do
know
reggie
mused
of
course
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
he
proceeded
and
i
not
saying
it
is
but
you
know
how
it
is
there
absolutely
no
doubt
that
a
chappie
does
not
show
at
his
best
when
he
being
married
what
i
mean
to
say
is
he
more
or
less
bound
to
look
a
fearful
ass
and
i
perfectly
certain
it
would
put
me
right
off
my
stroke
if
i
felt
that
some
chump
like
jack
ferris
or
ronnie
fitzgerald
was
trying
not
to
giggle
in
the
background
so
if
you
will
be
a
sportsman
and
come
and
hold
my
hand
till
the
thing
over
i
shall
be
eternally
grateful
where
are
you
going
to
be
married
in
london
alice
sneaked
off
there
last
night
it
was
easy
as
it
happened
because
by
a
bit
of
luck
old
marshmoreton
had
gone
to
town
yesterday
morning
nobody
knows
why
he
does
go
up
to
london
more
than
a
couple
of
times
a
year
she
going
to
meet
me
at
the
savoy
and
then
the
scheme
was
to
toddle
round
to
the
nearest
registrar
and
request
the
lad
to
unleash
the
marriage
service
i
whizzing
up
in
the
car
and
i
hoping
to
be
able
to
persuade
you
to
come
with
me
say
the
word
laddie
george
reflected
he
liked
reggie
and
there
was
no
particular
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
not
give
him
aid
and
comfort
in
this
crisis
true
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
it
would
be
torture
to
witness
a
wedding
ceremony
but
he
ought
not
to
let
that
stand
in
the
way
of
helping
a
friend
all
right
he
said
stout
fellow
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
it
is
putting
you
out
or
upsetting
your
plans
i
hope
or
anything
on
those
lines
not
at
all
i
had
to
go
up
to
london
today
anyway
well
you
ca
get
there
quicker
than
in
my
car
she
a
hummer
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
ask
how
is
your
little
affair
coming
along
everything
going
all
right
in
a
way
said
george
he
was
not
equal
to
confiding
his
troubles
to
reggie
of
course
your
trouble
is
like
mine
was
what
i
mean
is
maud
loves
you
and
all
that
and
all
you
got
to
think
out
is
a
scheme
for
laying
the
jolly
old
family
a
stymie
it
a
pity
almost
that
yours
is
a
case
of
having
to
win
the
girl
like
me
because
by
jove
laddie
said
reggie
with
solemn
emphasis
i
could
help
you
there
i
got
the
thing
down
fine
i
got
the
infallible
dope
george
smiled
bleakly
you
have
you
a
useful
fellow
to
have
around
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
it
is
but
you
do
need
it
no
of
course
not
i
was
forgetting
reggie
looked
at
his
watch
we
ought
to
be
shifting
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
i
want
to
be
late
it
appears
that
there
a
catch
of
some
sort
in
this
business
of
getting
married
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
if
you
roll
in
after
a
certain
hour
the
johnnie
in
charge
of
the
proceedings
gives
you
the
and
you
have
to
turn
up
again
next
day
however
we
shall
be
all
right
unless
we
have
a
breakdown
and
there
not
much
chance
of
that
i
been
tuning
up
the
old
car
since
seven
this
morning
and
she
sound
in
wind
and
limb
absolutely
oil
petrol
water
air
nuts
bolts
sprockets
carburetor
all
present
and
correct
i
been
looking
after
them
like
a
lot
of
baby
sisters
well
as
i
was
saying
i
got
the
dope
a
week
ago
i
was
just
one
of
the
mugs
did
know
a
thing
about
it
but
now
gaze
on
me
laddie
you
see
before
you
old
colonel
romeo
the
man
who
knows
it
all
started
on
the
night
of
the
ball
there
was
the
dickens
of
a
big
ball
you
know
to
celebrate
old
boots
to
which
poor
devil
he
contributed
nothing
but
the
sunshine
of
his
smile
never
having
learned
to
dance
on
that
occasion
a
most
rummy
and
extraordinary
thing
happened
i
got
pickled
to
the
eyebrows
he
laughed
happily
i
do
mean
that
that
was
a
unique
occurrence
and
so
forth
because
when
i
was
a
bachelor
it
was
rather
a
habit
of
mine
to
get
a
trifle
submerged
every
now
and
again
on
occasions
of
decent
mirth
and
festivity
but
the
rummy
thing
that
night
was
that
i
showed
it
up
till
then
i
been
told
by
experts
i
was
a
chappie
in
whom
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
detect
the
symptoms
you
might
get
a
bit
suspicious
if
you
found
i
move
but
you
could
never
be
certain
on
the
night
of
the
ball
however
i
suppose
i
had
been
filling
the
radiator
a
trifle
too
enthusiastically
you
see
i
had
deliberately
tried
to
shove
myself
more
or
less
below
the
surface
in
order
to
get
enough
nerve
to
propose
to
alice
i
do
know
what
your
experience
has
been
but
mine
is
that
proposing
a
thing
that
simply
is
within
the
scope
of
a
man
who
is
moderately
woozled
i
often
wondered
how
marriages
ever
occur
in
the
dry
states
of
america
well
as
i
was
saying
on
the
night
of
the
ball
a
most
rummy
thing
happened
i
thought
one
of
the
waiters
was
you
he
paused
impressively
to
allow
this
startling
statement
to
sink
in
and
was
he
said
george
absolutely
not
that
was
the
rummy
part
of
it
he
looked
as
like
you
as
your
twin
brother
i
have
a
twin
brother
no
i
know
what
you
mean
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
he
looked
just
like
your
twin
brother
would
have
looked
if
you
had
had
a
twin
brother
well
i
had
a
word
or
two
with
this
chappie
and
after
a
brief
conversation
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
was
up
to
the
gills
alice
was
with
me
at
the
time
and
noticed
it
too
now
have
thought
that
that
would
have
put
a
girl
off
a
fellow
and
all
that
but
no
nobody
could
have
been
more
sympathetic
and
she
has
confided
to
me
since
that
it
was
seeing
me
in
my
oiled
condition
that
really
turned
the
scale
what
i
mean
is
she
made
up
her
mind
to
save
me
from
myself
you
know
how
some
girls
are
angels
absolutely
always
on
the
look
out
to
pluck
brands
from
the
burning
and
what
not
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
the
good
seed
was
definitely
sown
that
night
is
that
your
recipe
then
you
would
advise
the
bridegroom
to
buy
a
case
of
champagne
and
a
wedding
licence
and
get
to
work
after
that
it
would
be
all
over
except
sending
out
the
invitations
reggie
shook
his
head
not
at
all
you
need
a
lot
more
than
that
that
only
the
start
you
got
to
follow
up
the
good
work
you
see
that
where
a
number
of
chappies
would
slip
up
and
i
pretty
certain
i
should
have
slipped
up
myself
but
for
another
singularly
rummy
occurrence
have
you
ever
had
a
it
what
the
word
i
want
one
of
those
things
fellows
get
sometimes
headaches
hazarded
george
no
no
nothing
like
that
i
do
mean
anything
you
get
i
mean
something
you
get
if
you
know
what
i
mean
measles
anonymous
letter
that
what
i
was
trying
to
say
it
a
most
extraordinary
thing
and
i
ca
understand
even
now
where
the
deuce
they
came
from
but
just
about
then
i
started
to
get
a
whole
bunch
of
anonymous
letters
from
some
chappie
unknown
who
sign
his
name
what
you
mean
is
that
the
letters
were
anonymous
said
george
absolutely
i
used
to
get
two
or
three
a
day
sometimes
whenever
i
went
up
to
my
room
i
find
another
waiting
for
me
on
the
offensive
eh
were
the
letters
offensive
anonymous
letters
usually
are
these
were
not
at
all
and
quite
the
reverse
they
contained
a
series
of
perfectly
topping
tips
on
how
a
fellow
should
proceed
who
wants
to
get
hold
of
a
girl
it
sounds
as
though
somebody
had
been
teaching
you
by
post
they
were
great
real
stuff
straight
from
the
stable
priceless
tips
like
yourself
indispensable
to
her
in
little
ways
her
tastes
and
so
on
and
so
forth
i
tell
you
laddie
i
pretty
soon
stopped
worrying
about
who
was
sending
them
to
me
and
concentrated
the
old
bean
on
acting
on
them
they
worked
like
magic
the
last
one
came
yesterday
morning
and
it
was
a
topper
it
was
all
about
how
a
chappie
who
was
nervous
should
proceed
technical
stuff
you
know
about
holding
her
hand
and
telling
her
you
lonely
and
being
sincere
and
straightforward
and
letting
your
heart
dictate
the
rest
have
you
ever
asked
for
one
card
when
you
wanted
to
fill
a
royal
flush
and
happened
to
pick
out
the
necessary
ace
i
did
once
when
i
was
up
at
oxford
and
by
jove
this
letter
gave
me
just
the
same
thrill
i
did
hesitate
i
just
sailed
in
i
was
cold
sober
but
i
did
worry
about
that
something
told
me
i
could
lose
it
was
like
having
to
hole
out
a
putt
and
well
there
you
are
do
you
know
reggie
became
thoughtful
dash
it
all
i
like
to
know
who
the
fellow
was
who
sent
me
those
letters
i
like
to
send
him
a
or
a
bit
of
the
cake
or
something
though
i
suppose
there
wo
be
any
cake
seeing
the
thing
taking
place
at
a
registrar
you
could
buy
a
bun
suggested
george
well
i
shall
never
know
i
suppose
and
now
how
about
trickling
forth
i
say
laddie
you
do
object
if
i
sing
slightly
from
time
to
time
during
the
journey
i
so
dashed
happy
you
know
not
at
all
if
it
not
against
the
traffic
regulations
reggie
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
room
in
an
ecstasy
it
a
rummy
thing
he
said
meditatively
i
just
remembered
that
when
i
was
at
school
i
used
to
sing
a
thing
called
the
wedding
song
at
do
you
know
and
what
not
jolly
little
thing
i
daresay
you
know
it
it
starts
dong
ding
dong
or
words
to
that
effect
along
for
it
is
my
i
remember
you
had
to
stretch
out
the
a
bit
deuced
awkward
if
you
had
laid
in
enough
breath
yeoman
that
was
it
i
knew
it
was
some
chappie
or
other
and
it
went
on
the
bride
in
something
or
other
is
doing
something
i
ca
recollect
well
what
i
mean
is
now
it
my
rummy
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
well
as
it
getting
tolerable
late
what
about
it
shift
ho
i
ready
would
you
like
me
to
bring
some
rice
thank
you
laddie
no
dashed
dangerous
stuff
rice
worse
than
shrapnel
got
your
hat
all
set
i
waiting
then
let
the
revels
commence
said
reggie
ding
dong
ding
dong
hurry
along
for
it
is
my
and
the
bride
dash
it
i
wish
i
could
remember
what
the
bride
was
doing
probably
writing
you
a
note
to
say
that
she
changed
her
mind
and
it
all
off
oh
my
god
exclaimed
reggie
come
on
chapter
and
reginald
byng
seated
at
a
table
in
the
corner
of
the
regent
gazed
fondly
into
each
other
eyes
george
seated
at
the
same
table
but
feeling
many
miles
away
watched
them
moodily
fighting
to
hold
off
a
depression
which
cured
for
a
while
by
the
exhilaration
of
the
ride
in
reggie
it
had
beaten
its
previous
record
for
the
trip
to
london
by
nearly
twenty
minutes
now
threatened
to
return
the
gay
scene
the
ecstasy
of
reggie
the
more
restrained
but
equally
manifest
happiness
of
his
bride
these
things
induced
melancholy
in
george
he
had
not
wished
to
attend
the
but
the
happy
pair
seemed
to
be
revolted
at
the
idea
that
he
should
stroll
off
and
get
a
bite
to
eat
somewhere
else
stick
by
us
laddie
reggie
had
said
pleadingly
for
there
is
much
to
discuss
and
we
need
the
counsel
of
a
man
of
the
world
we
are
married
all
right
though
it
did
seem
legal
in
that
little
registrar
office
put
in
but
that
as
the
blighters
say
in
books
is
but
a
beginning
not
an
end
we
have
now
to
think
out
the
most
tactful
way
of
letting
the
news
seep
through
as
it
were
to
the
mater
and
lord
marshmoreton
said
alice
do
forget
he
has
lost
his
secretary
and
lord
marshmoreton
amended
reggie
and
about
a
million
other
people
who
be
most
frightfully
peeved
at
my
doing
the
wedding
glide
without
consulting
them
stick
by
us
old
top
join
our
simple
meal
and
over
the
old
coronas
we
will
discuss
many
things
the
arrival
of
a
waiter
with
dishes
broke
up
the
silent
communion
between
husband
and
wife
and
lowered
reggie
to
a
more
earthly
plane
he
refilled
the
glasses
from
the
stout
bottle
that
nestled
in
the
only
this
one
dear
murmured
the
bride
in
a
warning
undertone
and
all
right
darling
replied
the
dutiful
groom
and
raised
his
own
to
his
lips
cheerio
here
to
us
all
maddest
merriest
day
of
all
the
glad
new
year
and
so
forth
and
now
he
continued
becoming
sternly
practical
about
the
good
old
sequel
and
aftermath
so
to
speak
of
this
little
binge
of
ours
what
to
be
done
you
a
brainy
sort
of
feller
bevan
old
man
and
we
look
to
you
for
suggestions
how
would
you
set
about
breaking
the
news
to
mother
write
her
a
letter
said
george
reggie
was
profoundly
impressed
did
i
tell
you
he
would
have
some
devilish
shrewd
scheme
he
said
enthusiastically
to
alice
write
her
a
letter
what
could
be
better
poetry
by
gad
his
face
clouded
but
what
would
you
say
in
it
that
a
pretty
knotty
point
not
at
all
be
perfectly
frank
and
straightforward
say
you
are
sorry
to
go
against
her
wishes
wishes
murmured
reggie
scribbling
industrially
on
the
back
of
the
marriage
but
you
know
that
all
she
wants
is
your
happiness
reggie
looked
doubtful
i
not
sure
about
that
last
bit
old
thing
you
do
know
the
mater
never
mind
reggie
put
in
alice
say
it
anyhow
bevan
is
perfectly
right
right
ho
darling
all
right
laddie
and
then
point
out
in
a
few
sentences
how
charming
byng
is
mrs
byng
reggie
smiled
fatuously
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
anything
that
sounded
so
indescribably
ripping
that
part
be
easy
enough
besides
the
mater
knows
alice
lady
caroline
has
seen
me
at
the
castle
said
his
bride
doubtfully
but
i
should
say
she
knows
me
she
has
hardly
spoken
a
dozen
words
to
me
there
said
reggie
earnestly
you
in
luck
dear
heart
the
mater
a
great
speaker
especially
in
moments
of
excitement
not
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
she
starts
on
me
between
ourselves
laddie
and
meaning
no
disrespect
to
the
dear
soul
when
the
mater
is
moved
and
begins
to
talk
she
uses
up
most
of
the
language
outspoken
is
she
i
should
hate
to
meet
the
person
who
could
her
said
reggie
george
sought
information
on
a
delicate
point
and
financially
does
she
exercise
any
authority
over
you
in
that
way
you
mean
has
the
mater
the
first
call
on
the
family
doubloons
said
reggie
oh
absolutely
not
you
see
when
i
call
her
the
mater
it
using
the
word
in
a
loose
sense
so
to
speak
she
my
really
she
has
her
own
little
collection
of
pieces
of
eight
and
i
have
mine
that
part
simple
enough
then
the
whole
thing
is
simple
i
do
see
what
you
been
worrying
about
just
what
i
keep
telling
him
bevan
said
alice
you
a
perfectly
free
agent
she
has
no
hold
on
you
of
any
kind
reggie
byng
blinked
dizzily
why
now
you
put
it
like
that
he
exclaimed
i
can
see
that
i
jolly
well
am
it
an
amazing
thing
you
know
habit
and
all
that
i
been
so
accustomed
for
years
to
jumping
through
hoops
and
shamming
dead
when
the
mater
lifted
a
little
finger
that
it
absolutely
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
a
soul
of
my
own
i
give
you
my
honest
word
i
never
saw
it
till
this
moment
and
now
it
too
late
eh
george
indicated
alice
with
a
gesture
the
byng
smiled
bevan
means
that
now
you
got
to
jump
through
hoops
and
sham
dead
when
i
lift
a
little
finger
reggie
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
nibbled
at
it
gently
blessums
finger
it
shall
lift
it
and
have
reggie
jumping
through
he
broke
off
and
tendered
george
a
manly
apology
sorry
old
top
forgot
myself
for
the
moment
occur
again
have
another
chicken
or
an
eclair
or
some
soup
or
something
over
the
cigars
reggie
became
expansive
now
that
you
lifted
the
frightful
weight
of
the
mater
off
my
mind
dear
old
lad
he
said
puffing
luxuriously
i
find
myself
surveying
the
future
in
a
calmer
spirit
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
thing
to
do
as
regards
the
mater
and
everybody
else
is
simply
to
prolong
the
merry
till
time
the
great
healer
has
had
a
chance
to
cure
the
wound
alice
wants
to
put
in
a
week
or
so
in
paris
paris
murmured
the
bride
ecstatically
then
i
would
like
to
trickle
southwards
to
the
riviera
if
you
mean
monte
carlo
dear
said
his
wife
with
gentle
firmness
no
no
no
not
monte
carlo
said
reggie
hastily
though
it
a
great
place
air
scenery
and
what
not
but
nice
and
bordighera
and
mentone
and
other
fairly
ripe
resorts
you
enjoy
them
and
after
that
i
had
a
scheme
for
buying
back
my
yacht
the
jolly
old
siren
and
cruising
about
the
mediterranean
for
a
month
or
so
i
sold
her
to
a
local
sportsman
when
i
was
in
america
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
i
saw
in
the
paper
yesterday
that
the
poor
old
buffer
had
died
suddenly
so
i
suppose
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
hold
of
her
for
the
time
being
reggie
broke
off
with
a
sharp
exclamation
my
sainted
aunt
what
the
matter
both
his
companions
were
looking
past
him
george
occupied
the
chair
that
had
its
back
to
the
door
and
was
unable
to
see
what
it
was
that
had
caused
their
consternation
but
he
deduced
that
someone
known
to
both
of
them
must
have
entered
the
restaurant
and
his
first
thought
perhaps
naturally
was
that
it
must
be
reggie
mater
reggie
dived
behind
a
menu
which
he
held
before
him
like
a
shield
and
his
bride
after
one
quick
look
had
turned
away
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
george
swung
around
but
the
newcomer
whoever
he
or
she
was
was
now
seated
and
indistinguishable
from
the
rest
of
the
lunchers
who
is
it
reggie
laid
down
the
menu
with
the
air
of
one
who
after
a
momentary
panic
rallies
do
know
what
i
making
such
a
fuss
about
he
said
stoutly
i
keep
forgetting
that
none
of
these
blighters
really
matter
in
the
scheme
of
things
i
a
good
mind
to
go
over
and
pass
the
time
of
day
do
pleaded
his
wife
i
feel
so
guilty
who
is
it
asked
george
again
your
great
scott
no
said
reggie
nothing
so
bad
as
that
it
old
marshmoreton
lord
marshmoreton
absolutely
and
looking
positively
festive
i
feel
so
awful
bevan
said
alice
you
know
i
left
the
castle
without
a
word
to
anyone
and
he
does
know
yet
that
there
wo
be
any
secretary
waiting
for
him
when
he
gets
back
reggie
took
another
look
over
george
shoulder
and
chuckled
it
all
right
darling
do
worry
we
can
nip
off
secretly
by
the
other
door
he
not
going
to
stop
us
he
got
a
girl
with
him
the
old
boy
has
come
to
life
absolutely
he
gassing
away
sixteen
to
the
dozen
to
a
frightfully
pretty
girl
with
gold
hair
if
you
slew
the
old
bean
round
at
an
angle
of
about
bevan
old
top
you
can
see
her
take
a
look
he
wo
see
you
he
got
his
back
to
us
do
you
call
her
pretty
asked
alice
disparagingly
now
that
i
take
a
good
look
precious
replied
reggie
with
alacrity
no
absolutely
not
not
my
style
at
all
his
wife
crumbled
bread
i
think
she
must
know
you
reggie
dear
she
said
softly
waving
to
you
she
waving
to
said
george
bringing
back
the
sunshine
to
reggie
life
and
causing
the
latter
face
to
lose
its
hunted
look
i
know
her
very
well
her
name
dore
billie
dore
old
man
said
reggie
be
a
good
fellow
and
slide
over
to
their
table
and
cover
our
retreat
i
know
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
really
but
i
simply
ca
face
the
old
boy
and
break
the
news
to
him
that
i
gone
bevan
added
alice
very
well
i

of

days

minute
or

laddie
george
threaded
his
way
across
the
room
billie
dore
welcomed
him
with
a
friendly
smile
the
earl
who
had
turned
to
observe
his
progress
seemed
less
delighted
to
see
him
his
face
wore
an
almost
furtive
look
he
reminded
george
of
a
schoolboy
who
has
been
caught
in
some
breach
of
the
law
fancy
seeing
you
here
george
said
billie
we
always
meeting
are
we
how
did
you
come
to
separate
yourself
from
the
pigs
and
chickens
i
thought
you
were
never
going
to
leave
them
i
had
to
run
up
on
business
explained
george
how
are
you
lord
marshmoreton
the
earl
nodded
briefly
so
you
on
to
him
too
said
billie
when
did
you
get
wise
lord
marshmoreton
was
kind
enough
to
call
on
me
the
other
morning
and
drop
the
incognito
is
dadda
the
foxiest
old
thing
said
billie
delightedly
imagine
him
standing
there
that
day
in
the
garden
kidding
us
along
like
that
i
tell
you
when
they
brought
me
his
card
last
night
after
the
first
act
and
i
went
down
to
take
a
slant
at
this
lord
marshmoreton
and
found
dadda
hanging
round
the
stage
door
you
could
have
knocked
me
over
with
a
i
have
not
stood
at
the
for
years
said
lord
marshmoreton
sadly
now
it
no
use
your
pulling
that
henry
methuselah
stuff
said
billie
affectionately
you
ca
get
away
with
it
anyone
can
see
you
just
a
kid
ca
they
george
she
indicated
the
blushing
earl
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
is
dadda
the
youngest
thing
that
ever
happened
exactly
what
i
told
him
myself
lord
marshmoreton
giggled
there
is
no
other
verb
that
describes
the
sound
that
proceeded
from
him
i
feel
young
he
admitted
i
wish
some
of
the
juveniles
in
the
shows
i
been
in
said
billie
were
as
young
as
you
it
getting
so
nowadays
that
thankful
if
a
juvenile
has
teeth
she
glanced
across
the
room
your
pals
are
walking
out
on
you
george
the
people
you
were
lunching
with
she
explained
they
leaving
that
all
right
i
said
to
them
he
looked
at
lord
marshmoreton
it
seemed
a
suitable
opportunity
to
break
the
news
i
was
lunching
with
and
byng
he
said
nothing
appeared
to
stir
beneath
lord
marshmoreton
tanned
forehead
reggie
byng
and
his
wife
lord
marshmoreton
added
george
this
time
he
secured
the
earl
interest
lord
marshmoreton
started
what
they
are
just
off
to
paris
said
george
reggie
byng
is
not
married
married
this
morning
i
was
best
man
busy
little
creature
interjected
billie
but
but
you
know
his
wife
said
george
casually
she
was
a
miss
faraday
i
think
she
was
your
secretary
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
deny
that
lord
marshmoreton
showed
emotion
his
mouth
opened
and
he
clutched
the
tablecloth
but
just
what
the
emotion
was
george
was
unable
to
say
till
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
come
from
his
innermost
being
the
other
exclaimed
thank
heaven
george
was
surprised
you
glad
of
course
i
glad
it
a
pity
they
did
know
how
you
were
going
to
feel
it
would
have
saved
them
a
lot
of
anxiety
i
rather
gathered
they
supposed
that
the
shock
was
apt
to
darken
your
whole
life
that
girl
said
lord
marshmoreton
vehemently
was
driving
me
crazy
always
bothering
me
to
come
and
work
on
that
damned
family
history
never
gave
me
a
moment
peace
i
liked
her
said
george
nice
enough
girl
admitted
his
lordship
grudgingly
but
a
damned
nuisance
about
the
house
always
at
me
to
go
on
with
the
family
history
as
if
there
were
better
things
to
do
with
one
time
than
writing
all
day
about
my
infernal
fools
of
ancestors
is
dadda
fractious
today
said
billie
reprovingly
giving
the
earl
hand
a
pat
quit
knocking
your
ancestors
you
very
lucky
to
have
ancestors
i
wish
i
had
the
dore
family
seems
to
go
back
about
as
far
as
the
presidency
of
willard
filmore
and
then
it
kind
of
gets
discouraged
and
quite
cold
gee
i
like
to
feel
that
my
had
helped
queen
elizabeth
with
the
rent
i
strong
for
the
fine
old
stately
families
of
england
stately
old
fiddlesticks
snapped
the
earl
did
you
see
his
eyes
flash
then
george
that
what
they
call
aristocratic
rage
it
the
fine
old
spirit
of
the
marshmoretons
boiling
over
i
noticed
it
said
george
just
like
lightning
it
no
use
trying
to
fool
us
dadda
said
billie
you
know
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
makes
you
feel
good
to
think
that
every
time
you
cut
yourself
with
your
you
bleed
blue
a
lot
of
silly
nonsense
grumbled
the
earl
what
is
this
foolery
of
titles
and
aristocracy
silly
one
man
as
good
as
another
this
is
the
spirit
of
said
george
approvingly
regular
stuff
agreed
billie
shake
hands
the
president
of
the
bolsheviki
lord
marshmoreton
ignored
the
interruption
there
was
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
evident
to
george
watching
him
with
close
interest
that
here
was
a
revelation
of
the
man
soul
that
thoughts
locked
away
for
years
in
the
other
bosom
were
crying
for
utterance
damned
silly
nonsense
when
i
was
a
boy
i
wanted
to
be
an
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
was
a
socialist
and
had
any
idea
except
to
work
for
my
living
and
make
a
name
for
myself
i
was
going
to
the
colonies
canada
the
fruit
farm
was
actually
bought
bought
and
paid
for
he
brooded
a
moment
on
that
fruit
farm
my
father
was
a
younger
son
and
then
my
uncle
must
go
and
break
his
neck
hunting
and
the
baby
poor
little
chap
got
croup
or
something
and
there
i
was
saddled
with
the
title
and
all
my
plans
gone
up
in
smoke
silly
nonsense
silly
nonsense
he
bit
the
end
of
a
cigar
and
you
ca
stand
up
against
it
he
went
on
ruefully
it
saps
you
it
like
some
damned
drug
i
fought
against
it
as
long
as
i
could
but
it
was
no
use
i
as
big
a
snob
as
any
of
them
now
i
afraid
to
do
what
i
want
to
do
always
thinking
of
the
family
dignity
i
have
taken
a
free
step
for
years
george
and
billie
exchanged
glances
each
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
they
were
eavesdropping
and
hearing
things
not
meant
to
be
heard
george
rose
i
must
be
getting
along
now
he
said
i
one
or
two
things
to
do
glad
to
have
seen
you
again
billie
is
the
show
going
all
right
fine
making
money
for
you
right
along
lord
marshmoreton
the
earl
nodded
without
speaking
it
was
not
often
now
that
he
rebelled
even
in
thoughts
against
the
lot
which
fate
had
thrust
upon
him
and
never
in
his
life
before
had
he
done
so
in
words
he
was
still
in
the
grip
of
the
strange
discontent
which
had
come
upon
him
so
abruptly
there
was
a
silence
after
george
had
gone
i
glad
we
met
george
said
billie
he
a
good
boy
she
spoke
soberly
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
feeling
of
affection
for
the
sturdy
little
man
opposite
her
the
glimpse
she
had
been
given
of
his
inner
self
had
somehow
made
him
come
alive
for
her
he
wants
to
marry
my
daughter
said
lord
marshmoreton
a
few
moments
before
billie
would
undoubtedly
have
replied
to
such
a
statement
with
some
jocular
remark
expressing
disbelief
that
the
earl
could
have
a
daughter
old
enough
to
be
married
but
now
she
felt
oddly
serious
and
unlike
her
usual
flippant
self
oh
was
all
she
could
find
to
say
she
wants
to
marry
him
not
for
years
had
billie
dore
felt
embarrassed
but
she
felt
so
now
she
judged
herself
unworthy
to
be
the
recipient
of
these
very
private
confidences
oh
she
said
again
he
a
good
fellow
i
like
him
i
liked
him
the
moment
we
met
he
knew
it
too
and
i
knew
he
liked
me
a
group
of
men
and
girls
from
a
neighbouring
table
passed
on
their
way
to
the
door
one
of
the
girls
nodded
to
billie
she
returned
the
nod
absently
the
party
moved
on
billie
frowned
down
at
the
tablecloth
and
drew
a
pattern
on
it
with
a
fork
why
do
you
let
george
marry
your
daughter
lord
marshmoreton
the
earl
drew
at
his
cigar
in
silence
i
know
it
not
my
business
said
billie
apologetically
interpreting
the
silence
as
a
rebuff
because
i
the
earl
of
marshmoreton
i
see
no
you
do
snapped
the
earl
you
think
i
mean
by
that
that
i
think
your
friend
is
good
enough
to
marry
my
daughter
you
think
that
i
an
incurable
snob
and
i
no
doubt
he
thinks
so
too
though
i
took
the
trouble
to
explain
my
attitude
to
him
when
we
last
met
you
wrong
it
is
that
at
all
when
i
say
the
earl
of
marshmoreton
i
mean
that
i
a
poor
spineless
fool
afraid
to
do
the
right
thing
because
he
dare
go
in
the
teeth
of
the
family
i
do
understand
what
have
your
family
got
to
do
with
it
they
worry
the
life
out
of
me
i
wish
you
could
meet
my
sister
caroline
that
what
they
got
to
do
with
it
girls
in
my
daughter
unfortunate
position
have
got
to
marry
position
or
money
well
i
do
know
about
position
but
when
it
comes
to
money
why
george
is
the
fellow
that
made
the
famous
he
and
rockefeller
have
got
all
there
is
except
the
little
bit
they
have
let
andy
carnegie
have
for
what
do
you
mean
he
told
me
he
worked
for
a
living
billie
was
becoming
herself
again
embarrassment
had
fled
if
you
call
it
work
he
a
composer
i
know
writes
tunes
and
things
billie
regarded
him
compassionately
and
i
suppose
living
out
in
the
woods
the
way
that
you
do
that
you
have
a
notion
that
they
pay
him
for
it
pay
him
yes
but
how
much
composers
were
not
rich
men
in
my
day
i
wish
you
would
talk
of
day
as
if
you
telling
the
boys
down
at
the
corner
store
about
the
good
times
they
all
had
before
the
flood
you
one
of
the
younger
set
and
do
let
me
have
to
tell
you
again
say
listen
you
know
that
show
you
saw
last
night
the
one
where
i
was
supported
by
a
few
underlings
well
george
wrote
the
music
for
that
i
know
he
told
me
so
well
did
he
tell
you
that
he
draws
three
per
cent
of
the
gross
receipts
you
saw
the
house
we
had
last
night
it
was
a
fair
average
house
we
are
playing
to
over
fourteen
thousand
dollars
a
week
george
little
bit
of
that
is
i
ca
do
it
in
my
head
but
it
a
round
four
hundred
dollars
that
eighty
pounds
of
your
money
and
did
he
tell
you
that
this
same
show
ran
over
a
year
in
new
york
to
big
business
all
the
time
and
that
there
are
three
companies
on
the
road
now
and
did
he
mention
that
this
is
the
ninth
show
he
done
and
that
seven
of
the
others
were
just
as
big
hits
as
this
one
and
did
he
remark
in
passing
that
he
gets
royalties
on
every
copy
of
his
music
that
sold
and
that
at
least
ten
of
his
things
have
sold
over
half
a
million
no
he
did
because
he
is
the
sort
of
fellow
who
stands
around
blowing
about
his
income
but
you
know
it
now
why
he
a
rich
man
i
do
know
what
you
call
rich
but
keeping
on
the
safe
side
i
should
say
that
george
pulls
down
in
a
good
year
during
the
season
around
five
thousand
dollars
a
week
lord
marshmoreton
was
frankly
staggered
a
thousand
pounds
a
week
i
had
no
idea
i
thought
you
had
and
while
i
boosting
george
let
me
tell
you
another
thing
he
one
of
the
whitest
men
that
ever
happened
i
know
him
you
can
take
it
from
me
if
there
anything
rotten
in
a
fellow
the
will
bring
it
out
and
it
has
come
out
in
george
yet
so
i
guess
it
is
there
george
is
all
right
he
has
at
least
an
excellent
advocate
oh
i
strong
for
george
i
wish
there
were
more
like
him
well
if
you
think
i
butted
in
on
your
private
affairs
sufficiently
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
moving
we
a
rehearsal
this
afternoon
let
it
go
said
lord
marshmoreton
boyishly
yes
and
how
quick
do
you
think
they
would
let
me
go
if
i
did
i
an
honest
and
i
ca
afford
to
lose
jobs
lord
marshmoreton
fiddled
with
his
i
could
offer
you
an
alternative
position
if
you
cared
to
accept
it
billie
looked
at
him
keenly
other
men
in
similar
circumstances
had
made
much
the
same
remark
to
her
she
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
little
disappointed
in
her
new
friend
well
she
said
dryly
shoot
you
gathered
no
doubt
from
bevan
conversation
that
my
secretary
has
left
me
and
run
away
and
got
married
would
you
like
to
take
her
place
it
was
not
easy
to
disconcert
billie
dore
but
she
was
taken
aback
she
had
been
expecting
something
different
you
a
shriek
dadda
i
perfectly
serious
can
you
see
me
at
a
castle
i
can
see
you
perfectly
lord
marshmoreton
rather
formal
manner
left
him
do
please
accept
my
dear
child
i
got
to
finish
this
damned
family
history
some
time
or
other
the
family
expect
me
to
only
yesterday
my
sister
caroline
got
me
in
a
corner
and
bored
me
for
half
an
hour
about
it
i
simply
ca
face
the
prospect
of
getting
another
alice
faraday
from
an
agency
charming
girl
charming
girl
of
course
but
but
well
i
be
damned
if
i
do
it
and
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
billie
bubbled
over
with
laughter
of
all
the
impulsive
kids
she
gurgled
i
never
met
anyone
like
you
dadda
you
do
even
know
that
i
can
use
a
typewriter
i
do
bevan
told
me
you
were
an
excellent
stenographer
so
george
has
been
boosting
me
too
has
he
she
mused
i
must
say
i
love
to
come
that
old
place
got
me
when
i
saw
it
that
day
that
settled
then
said
lord
marshmoreton
masterfully
go
to
the
theatre
and
tell
them
tell
whatever
is
usual
in
these
cases
and
then
go
home
and
pack
and
meet
me
at
waterloo
at
six
the
train
leaves
at
return
of
the
wanderer
accompanied
by
dizzy
blonde
certainly
got
it
all
fixed
have
you
do
you
think
the
family
will
stand
for
me
damn
the
family
said
lord
marshmoreton
stoutly
there
one
thing
said
billie
complacently
eyeing
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
of
her
i
may
glitter
in
the
but
it
is
genuine
when
i
was
a
kid
i
was
a
regular
little
i
never
supposed
for
a
moment
that
it
was
anything
but
genuine
then
you
got
a
fine
unsuspicious
nature
dadda
and
i
admire
you
for
it
six
at
waterloo
said
the
earl
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
billie
regarded
him
with
affectionate
admiration
boys
will
be
boys
she
said
all
right
i
be
there
chapter
young
blighted
albert
said
keggs
the
butler
shifting
his
weight
so
that
it
distributed
itself
more
comfortably
over
the
creaking
chair
in
which
he
reclined
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
young
feller
me
lad
the
day
was
a
week
after
lord
marshmoreton
visit
to
london
the
hour
six
the
housekeeper
room
in
which
the
upper
servants
took
their
meals
had
emptied
of
the
gay
company
which
had
just
finished
dinner
only
keggs
remained
placidly
digesting
albert
whose
duty
it
was
to
wait
on
the
upper
servants
was
moving
to
and
fro
morosely
collecting
the
plates
and
glasses
the
boy
was
in
no
happy
frame
of
mind
throughout
dinner
the
conversation
at
table
had
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
now
celebrated
elopement
of
reggie
byng
and
his
bride
and
few
subjects
could
have
made
more
painful
listening
to
albert
what
been
the
result
and
what
i
might
call
the
upshot
said
keggs
continuing
his
homily
of
all
your
making
yourself
so
busy
and
thrusting
of
yourself
forward
and
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
your
elders
and
betters
the
upshot
and
issue
of
it
been
that
you
are
out
five
shillings
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
five
shillings
what
you
might
have
spent
on
some
good
book
and
improved
your
mind
and
goodness
knows
it
wants
all
the
improving
it
can
get
for
of
all
the
worthless
idle
little
messers
it
ever
been
my
misfortune
to
have
dealings
with
you
are
the
champion
be
careful
of
them
plates
young
man
and
do
breathe
so
hard
you
got
hasthma
or
something
you
i
ca
breathe
now
complained
the
stricken
child
not
like
a
grampus
you
ca
and
do
you
forget
it
keggs
wagged
his
head
reprovingly
well
so
your
reggie
byng
gone
and
eloped
has
he
that
ought
to
teach
you
to
be
more
careful
another
time
you
go
gambling
and
plunging
into
sweepstakes
the
idea
of
a
child
of
your
age
the
audacity
to
thrust
forward
like
that
do
call
him
my
reggie
byng
i
did
draw
there
no
need
to
go
into
all
that
again
young
feller
you
accepted
freely
and
without
prejudice
when
the
fair
exchange
was
suggested
so
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
he
is
your
reggie
byng
i
you
going
to
send
him
a
well
you
ai
any
better
off
than
me
with
all
your
robbery
my
what
you
what
i
said
well
do
let
me
it
again
the
idea
if
you
any
objections
to
parting
with
that
ticket
you
should
have
stated
them
clearly
at
the
time
and
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
i
ai
any
better
off
than
you
are
i
my
reasons
you
think
you
which
is
a
very
different
thing
i
suppose
you
imagine
that
you
put
a
stopper
on
a
certain
little
affair
by
surreptitiously
destroying
letters
entrusted
to
you
i
never
exclaimed
albert
with
a
convulsive
start
that
nearly
sent
eleven
plates
dashing
to
destruction
many
times
have
i
got
to
tell
you
to
be
careful
of
them
plates
said
keggs
sternly
who
do
you
think
you
are
a
juggler
on
the
them
about
like
that
yes
i
know
all
about
that
letter
you
thought
you
was
very
clever
i
no
doubt
but
let
me
tell
you
young
blighted
albert
that
only
the
other
evening
ladyship
and
bevan
a
long
and
extended
interview
in
spite
of
all
your
hefforts
i
saw
through
your
little
game
and
i
proceeded
and
went
and
arranged
the
meeting
in
spite
of
himself
albert
was
awed
he
was
oppressed
by
the
sense
of
struggling
with
a
superior
intellect
yes
you
did
he
managed
to
say
with
the
proper
note
of
incredulity
but
in
his
heart
he
was
not
incredulous
dimly
albert
had
begun
to
perceive
that
years
must
elapse
before
he
could
become
capable
of
matching
himself
in
battles
of
wits
with
this
yes
i
certainly
did
said
keggs
i
do
know
what
at
the
interview
not
being
present
in
person
but
i
no
doubt
that
everything
proceeded
satisfactorily
and
a
fat
lot
of
good
that
going
to
do
you
when
allowed
to
come
inside
the
a
bland
smile
irradiated
the
butler
face
if
by
you
alloodin
to
bevan
young
blighted
albert
let
me
tell
you
that
it
wo
be
long
before
becomes
a
regular
duly
invited
guest
at
the
castle
a
lot
of
chance
would
you
care
to
another
five
shillings
even
money
on
it
albert
recoiled
he
had
had
enough
of
speculation
where
the
butler
was
concerned
where
that
schemer
was
allowed
to
get
within
reach
of
it
hard
cash
melted
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
never
you
mind
what
i
going
to
do
i
my
methods
all
i
to
say
to
you
is
that
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
bevan
will
be
seated
in
our
with
feet
under
our
table
replying
according
to
his
personal
taste
and
preference
when
i
ask
if
or
sherry
brush
all
them
crumbs
carefully
off
the
tablecloth
young
blighted
albert
do
shuffle
your
feet
breathe
softly
through
your
nose
and
close
the
door
you
when
you
finished
oh
go
and
eat
cake
said
albert
bitterly
but
he
said
it
to
his
immortal
soul
not
aloud
the
lad
spirit
was
broken
keggs
the
processes
of
digestion
completed
presented
himself
before
lord
belpher
in
the
percy
was
alone
the
so
numerous
on
the
night
of
the
ball
and
on
his
birthday
had
melted
down
now
to
reasonable
proportions
the
second
and
third
cousins
had
retired
flushed
and
gratified
to
obscure
dens
from
which
they
had
emerged
and
the
castle
housed
only
the
more
prominent
members
of
the
family
always
harder
to
dislodge
than
the
small
fry
the
bishop
still
remained
and
the
colonel
besides
these
there
were
perhaps
half
a
dozen
more
of
the
closer
relations
to
lord
belpher
way
of
thinking
half
a
dozen
too
many
he
was
not
fond
of
his
family
might
i
have
a
word
with
your
lordship
what
is
it
keggs
keggs
was
a
man
but
he
found
it
a
little
hard
to
begin
then
he
remembered
that
once
in
the
misty
past
he
had
seen
lord
belpher
spanked
for
stealing
jam
he
himself
having
acted
on
that
occasion
as
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
memory
nerved
him
i
earnestly
that
your
lordship
will
not
think
that
i
am
taking
a
liberty
i
been
in
his
lordship
your
father
service
many
years
now
and
the
family
honour
is
if
i
may
be
pardoned
for
saying
so
extremely
near
my
i
known
your
lordship
since
you
were
a
mere
boy
and
lord
belpher
had
listened
with
growing
impatience
to
this
preamble
his
temper
was
seldom
at
its
best
these
days
and
the
rolling
periods
annoyed
him
yes
yes
of
course
he
said
what
is
it
keggs
was
himself
now
in
his
opening
remarks
he
had
simply
been
as
it
were
winding
up
he
was
now
prepared
to
begin
your
lordship
will
recall
inquiring
of
me
on
the
night
of
the
ball
as
to
the
bona
fides
of
one
of
the
temporary
waiters
the
one
that
stated
that
was
the
cousin
of
young
bli
of
the
boy
albert
the
page
i
have
been
making
inquiries
your
lordship
and
i
regret
to
say
i
find
that
the
man
was
a
impostor
he
informed
me
that
was
albert
cousin
but
albert
now
informs
me
that
no
cousin
in
america
i
am
extremely
sorry
this
should
have
occurred
your
lordship
and
i
you
will
attribute
it
to
the
bustle
and
haste
inseparable
from
duties
as
mine
on
such
a
occasion
i
know
the
fellow
was
an
impostor
he
was
probably
after
the
spoons
keggs
coughed
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
take
a
further
liberty
your
lordship
might
i
suggest
that
i
am
aware
of
the
man
identity
and
of
his
motive
for
visiting
the
castle
he
waited
a
little
apprehensively
this
was
the
crucial
point
in
the
interview
if
lord
belpher
did
not
now
freeze
him
with
a
glance
and
order
him
from
the
room
the
danger
would
be
past
and
he
could
speak
freely
his
light
blue
eyes
were
expressionless
as
they
met
percy
but
inwardly
he
was
feeling
much
the
same
sensation
as
he
was
wont
to
experience
when
the
family
was
in
town
and
he
had
managed
to
slip
off
to
kempton
park
or
some
other
and
put
some
of
his
savings
on
a
horse
as
he
felt
when
the
racing
steeds
thundered
down
the
straight
so
did
he
feel
now
astonishment
showed
in
lord
belpher
round
face
just
as
it
was
about
to
be
succeeded
by
indignation
the
butler
spoke
again
i
am
aware
your
lordship
that
it
is
not
my
place
to
offer
suggestions
as
to
the
private
and
intimate
affairs
of
the
family
i
the
honour
to
serve
but
if
your
lordship
would
consent
to
overlook
the
liberty
i
think
i
could
be
of
and
assistance
in
a
matter
which
is
causing
annoyance
and
unpleasantness
to
all
he
invigorated
himself
with
another
dip
into
the
waters
of
memory
yes
the
young
man
before
him
might
be
lord
belpher
son
of
his
employer
and
heir
to
all
these
great
estates
but
once
he
had
seen
him
spanked
perhaps
percy
also
remembered
this
perhaps
he
merely
felt
that
keggs
was
a
faithful
old
servant
and
as
such
entitled
to
thrust
himself
into
the
family
affairs
whatever
his
reasons
he
now
definitely
lowered
the
barrier
well
he
said
with
a
glance
at
the
door
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
witnesses
to
an
act
of
which
the
aristocrat
in
him
disapproved
go
on
keggs
breathed
freely
the
was
past
a
natural
interest
your
lordship
he
said
we
of
the
servants
generally
manage
to
become
respectfully
aware
of
whatever
to
be
transpirin
above
stairs
may
i
say
that
i
became
acquainted
at
an
early
stage
with
the
trouble
which
your
lordship
is
unfortunately
with
a
certain
party
lord
belpher
although
his
whole
being
revolted
against
what
practically
amounted
to
hobnobbing
with
a
butler
perceived
that
he
had
committed
himself
to
the
discussion
it
revolted
him
to
think
that
these
delicate
family
secrets
were
the
subject
of
conversation
in
menial
circles
but
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
now
and
such
was
the
with
which
he
had
declared
war
upon
george
bevan
that
at
this
stage
in
the
proceedings
his
chief
emotion
was
a
hope
that
keggs
might
have
something
sensible
to
suggest
i
think
begging
your
lordship
pardon
for
making
the
remark
that
you
are
acting
injudicious
i
been
in
service
a
great
number
of
years
startin
as
steward
room
boy
and
rising
to
my
present
position
and
i
may
say
i
experience
during
those
years
of
several
cases
where
the
daughter
or
son
of
the
contemplated
a
misalliance
and
all
but
one
of
the
cases
ended
disastrously
your
lordship
on
account
of
the
family
trying
opposition
it
is
my
experience
that
opposition
in
matters
of
the
is
useless
feedin
as
it
so
to
speak
does
the
flame
young
people
your
lordship
if
i
may
be
pardoned
for
employing
the
expression
in
the
present
case
are
naturally
romantic
and
if
you
keep
away
from
a
thing
they
sit
and
pity
themselves
and
want
it
all
the
more
and
in
the
end
you
may
be
sure
they
get
it
no
way
of
stoppin
them
i
was
not
on
sufficiently
easy
terms
with
the
late
lord
worlingham
to
give
the
benefit
of
my
experience
on
the
occasion
when
the
honourable
aubrey
pershore
fell
in
love
with
the
young
person
at
the
gaiety
theatre
otherwise
i
could
told
he
was
not
acting
judicious
his
lordship
opposed
the
match
in
every
way
and
the
young
couple
ran
off
and
got
married
at
a
registrar
it
was
the
same
when
a
young
man
who
was
tutor
to
ladyship
brother
attracted
lady
evelyn
walls
the
only
daughter
of
the
earl
of
ackleton
in
fact
your
lordship
the
only
entanglement
of
the
kind
that
came
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
in
the
whole
of
my
personal
experience
was
the
affair
of
lady
catherine
duseby
lord
bridgefield
daughter
who
injudiciously
became
infatuated
with
a
instructor
lord
belpher
had
ceased
to
feel
distantly
superior
to
his
companion
the
butler
powerful
personality
hypnotized
him
long
ere
the
harangue
was
ended
he
was
as
a
little
child
drinking
in
the
utterances
of
a
master
he
bent
forward
eagerly
keggs
had
broken
off
his
remarks
at
the
most
interesting
point
what
happened
inquired
percy
the
young
man
proceeded
keggs
was
a
young
man
of
considerable
personal
attractions
large
brown
eyes
and
a
athletic
lissome
figure
brought
about
by
it
was
no
wonder
in
the
opinion
of
the
servants
that
ladyship
should
have
found
fascinated
by
him
particularly
as
i
myself
her
observe
at
a
full
that
was
in
her
opinion
the
only
thing
except
her
toy
pomeranian
that
made
life
worth
living
but
when
she
announced
that
she
had
become
engaged
to
this
young
man
there
was
the
greatest
consternation
i
was
not
of
course
privileged
to
be
a
participant
at
the
many
councils
and
discussions
that
ensued
and
took
place
but
i
was
aware
that
such
transpired
with
great
frequency
eventually
lordship
took
the
shrewd
step
of
assuming
acquiescence
and
inviting
the
young
man
to
visit
us
in
scotland
and
within
ten
days
of
his
arrival
your
lordship
the
match
was
broken
off
he
went
back
to
and
ladyship
took
up
visiting
the
poor
and
eventually
contracted
an
altogether
suitable
alliance
by
marrying
lord
ronald
spofforth
the
second
son
of
his
grace
the
duke
of
gorbals
and
strathbungo
how
did
it
happen
seein
the
young
man
in
the
surroundings
of
own
ladyship
soon
began
to
see
that
she
had
taken
too
romantic
a
view
of
previous
your
lordship
was
one
of
the
lower
middle
class
what
is
sometimes
termed
the
bourjoisy
and
were
not
the
of
the
class
to
which
ladyship
belonged
nothing
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
and
was
injudicious
in
choice
of
forks
the
very
first
night
at
dinner
took
a
steel
knife
to
the
ontray
and
i
see
ladyship
look
at
him
very
sharp
as
much
as
to
say
that
scales
had
fallen
from
eyes
it
did
take
long
after
that
to
become
convinced
that
led
astray
then
you
think
it
is
not
for
me
to
presume
to
offer
anything
but
the
most
respectful
advice
your
lordship
but
i
should
most
certainly
advocate
a
similar
procedure
in
the
present
instance
lord
belpher
reflected
recent
events
had
brought
home
to
him
the
magnitude
of
the
task
he
had
assumed
when
he
had
appointed
himself
the
watcher
of
his
sister
movements
the
affair
of
the
curate
and
the
village
blacksmith
had
shaken
him
both
physically
and
spiritually
his
feet
were
still
sore
and
his
confidence
in
himself
had
waned
considerably
the
thought
of
having
to
continue
his
espionage
indefinitely
was
not
a
pleasant
one
how
much
simpler
and
more
effective
it
would
be
to
adopt
the
suggestion
which
had
been
offered
to
i
not
sure
you
are
right
keggs
thank
you
your
lordship
i
feel
convinced
of
it
i
will
speak
to
my
father
tonight
very
good
your
lordship
i
am
glad
to
have
been
of
service
young
blighted
albert
said
keggs
crisply
shortly
after
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
you
to
take
this
note
to
bevan
at
the
cottage
down
by
platt
farm
and
you
to
deliver
it
without
playing
any
of
your
and
you
to
wait
for
an
answer
and
you
to
bring
that
answer
back
to
me
too
and
to
lord
marshmoreton
and
i
may
tell
you
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
opening
it
with
steam
from
the
kitchen
kettle
that
i
already
done
so
it
an
invitation
to
dine
with
us
tonight
so
now
you
know
look
slippy
albert
capitulated
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
humble
he
perceived
how
misguided
he
had
been
ever
to
suppose
that
he
could
pit
his
pigmy
wits
against
this
worker
of
wonders
crikey
he
ejaculated
it
was
all
that
he
could
say
and
there
one
more
thing
young
feller
me
lad
added
keggs
earnestly
do
you
ever
grow
up
to
be
such
a
as
our
friend
percy
do
forget
i
warned
you
chapter
life
is
like
some
crazy
machine
that
is
always
going
either
too
slow
or
too
fast
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
we
alternate
between
the
sargasso
sea
and
the
rapids
forever
either
becalmed
or
it
seemed
to
maud
as
she
looked
across
the
in
order
to
make
sure
for
the
twentieth
time
that
it
really
was
george
bevan
who
sat
opposite
her
that
after
months
in
which
nothing
whatever
had
happened
she
was
now
living
through
a
period
when
everything
was
happening
at
once
life
from
being
a
machine
had
suddenly
begun
to
race
to
the
orderly
routine
that
stretched
back
to
the
time
when
she
had
been
hurried
home
in
disgrace
from
wales
there
had
succeeded
a
mad
whirl
of
events
to
which
the
miracle
of
tonight
had
come
as
a
fitting
climax
she
had
not
begun
to
dress
for
dinner
till
somewhat
late
and
had
consequently
entered
the
just
as
keggs
was
announcing
that
the
meal
was
ready
she
had
received
her
first
shock
when
the
plummer
emerging
from
a
mixed
crowd
of
relatives
and
friends
had
informed
her
that
he
was
to
take
her
in
she
had
not
expected
plummer
to
be
there
though
he
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
plummer
at
their
last
meeting
had
stated
his
intention
of
going
abroad
for
a
bit
to
mend
his
bruised
heart
and
it
was
a
little
disconcerting
to
a
sensitive
girl
to
find
her
victim
popping
up
again
like
this
she
did
not
know
that
as
far
as
plummer
was
concerned
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
considered
opened
again
to
plummer
analysing
the
girl
motives
in
refusing
him
there
had
come
the
idea
that
there
was
another
and
that
this
other
must
be
reggie
byng
from
the
first
he
had
always
looked
upon
reggie
as
his
worst
rival
and
now
reggie
had
bolted
with
the
faraday
girl
leaving
maud
in
excellent
condition
so
it
seemed
to
plummer
to
console
herself
with
a
worthier
man
plummer
knew
all
about
the
rebound
and
the
part
it
plays
in
the
affairs
of
the
heart
his
own
case
two
years
earlier
had
been
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
refusal
of
the
youngest
devenish
girl
to
marry
him
had
caused
him
to
rebound
into
the
dangerous
society
of
the
second
girl
from
the
end
of
the
first
row
in
the
summertime
is
number
in
the
alhambra
revue
he
had
come
to
the
castle
tonight
gloomy
but
not
without
hope
maud
second
shock
eclipsed
the
first
entirely
no
notification
had
been
given
to
her
either
by
her
father
or
by
percy
of
the
proposed
extension
of
the
hand
of
hospitality
to
george
and
the
sight
of
him
standing
there
talking
to
her
aunt
caroline
made
her
momentarily
dizzy
life
which
for
several
days
had
had
all
the
properties
now
of
a
dream
now
of
a
nightmare
became
more
unreal
than
ever
she
could
conceive
no
explanation
of
george
presence
he
could
not
be
there
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
yet
there
undoubtedly
he
was
her
manner
as
she
accompanied
plummer
down
the
stairs
took
on
such
a
dazed
sweetness
that
her
escort
felt
that
in
coming
there
that
night
he
had
done
the
wisest
act
of
a
lifetime
studded
but
sparsely
with
wise
acts
it
seemed
to
plummer
that
this
girl
had
softened
towards
him
certainly
something
had
changed
her
he
could
not
know
that
she
was
merely
wondering
if
she
was
awake
george
meanwhile
across
the
table
was
also
having
a
little
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
faculties
to
the
progress
of
events
he
had
given
up
trying
to
imagine
why
he
had
been
invited
to
this
dinner
and
was
now
endeavouring
to
find
some
theory
which
would
square
with
the
fact
of
billie
dore
being
at
the
castle
at
precisely
this
hour
billie
by
rights
should
have
been
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
her
in
a
at
the
regal
yet
there
she
sat
very
much
at
her
ease
in
this
aristocratic
company
so
quietly
and
unobtrusively
dressed
in
some
black
stuff
that
at
first
he
had
scarcely
recognized
her
she
was
talking
to
the
bishop
the
voice
of
keggs
at
his
elbow
broke
in
on
his
reverie
sherry
or
sir
george
could
not
have
explained
why
this
reminder
of
the
presence
should
have
made
him
feel
better
but
it
did
there
was
something
solid
and
tranquilizing
about
keggs
he
had
noticed
it
before
for
the
first
time
the
sensation
of
having
been
smitten
over
the
head
with
some
blunt
instrument
began
to
abate
it
was
as
if
keggs
by
the
mere
intonation
of
his
voice
had
said
all
this
no
doubt
seems
very
strange
and
unusual
to
you
but
feel
no
alarm
i
am
here
george
began
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
a
cloud
seemed
to
have
cleared
from
his
brain
he
found
himself
looking
on
his
as
individuals
rather
than
as
a
confused
mass
the
prophet
daniel
after
the
initial
embarrassment
of
finding
himself
in
the
society
of
the
lions
had
passed
away
must
have
experienced
a
somewhat
similar
sensation
he
began
to
sort
these
people
out
and
label
them
there
had
been
introductions
in
the
but
they
had
left
him
with
a
bewildered
sense
of
having
heard
somebody
recite
a
page
from
burke
peerage
not
since
that
day
in
the
free
library
in
london
when
he
had
dived
into
that
fascinating
volume
in
order
to
discover
maud
identity
had
he
undergone
such
a
rain
of
titles
he
now
took
stock
to
ascertain
how
many
of
these
people
he
could
identify
the
was
an
absolute
failure
of
all
those
present
the
only
individuals
he
could
swear
to
were
his
own
personal
little
playmates
with
whom
he
had
sported
in
other
surroundings
there
was
lord
belpher
for
instance
eyeing
him
with
a
hostility
that
could
hardly
be
called
veiled
there
was
lord
marshmoreton
at
the
head
of
the
table
listening
glumly
to
the
conversation
of
a
stout
woman
with
a
pearl
necklace
but
who
was
that
woman
was
it
lady
jane
allenby
or
lady
edith
or
lady
patricia
fowles
and
who
above
all
was
the
fellow
with
the
moustache
talking
to
maud
he
sought
assistance
from
the
girl
he
had
taken
in
to
dinner
she
appeared
as
far
as
he
could
ascertain
from
a
short
acquaintance
to
be
an
amiable
little
thing
she
was
small
and
young
and
fluffy
and
he
had
caught
enough
of
her
name
at
the
moment
of
introduction
to
gather
that
she
was
plain
miss
something
a
fact
which
seemed
to
him
to
draw
them
together
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
who
some
of
these
people
are
he
said
as
she
turned
from
talking
to
the
man
on
her
who
is
the
man
over
there
which
man
the
one
talking
to
lady
maud
the
fellow
whose
face
ought
to
be
shuffled
and
dealt
again
that
my
brother
that
held
george
during
the
soup
i
sorry
about
your
brother
he
said
rallying
with
the
fish
that
very
sweet
of
you
it
was
the
light
that
deceived
me
now
that
i
look
again
i
see
that
his
face
has
great
charm
the
girl
giggled
george
began
to
feel
better
who
are
some
of
the
others
i
did
get
your
name
for
instance
they
shot
it
at
me
so
quick
that
it
had
whizzed
by
before
i
could
catch
it
my
name
is
plummer
george
was
electrified
he
looked
across
the
table
with
more
vivid
interest
the
amorous
plummer
had
been
just
a
voice
to
him
till
now
it
was
exciting
to
see
him
in
the
flesh
and
who
are
the
rest
of
them
they
are
all
members
of
the
family
i
thought
you
knew
them
i
know
lord
marshmoreton
and
lady
maud
and
of
course
lord
belpher
he
caught
percy
eye
as
it
surveyed
him
coldly
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
nodded
cheerfully
great
pal
of
mine
lord
belpher
the
fluffy
miss
plummer
twisted
her
pretty
face
into
a
grimace
of
disapproval
i
do
like
percy
no
i
think
he
conceited
surely
not
what
could
he
have
to
be
conceited
about
he
stiff
yes
of
course
that
how
he
strikes
people
at
first
the
first
time
i
met
him
i
thought
he
was
an
awful
stiff
but
you
should
see
him
in
his
moments
of
relaxation
he
one
of
those
fellows
you
have
to
get
to
know
he
grows
on
you
yes
but
look
at
that
affair
with
the
policeman
in
london
everybody
in
the
county
is
talking
about
it
young
blood
sighed
george
young
blood
of
course
percy
is
wild
he
must
have
been
intoxicated
oh
undoubtedly
said
george
miss
plummer
glanced
across
the
table
do
look
at
edwin
which
is
edwin
my
brother
i
mean
look
at
the
way
he
keeps
staring
at
maud
edwin
awfully
in
love
with
maud
she
rattled
on
with
engaging
frankness
at
least
he
thinks
he
is
he
been
in
love
with
a
different
girl
every
season
since
i
came
out
and
now
that
reggie
byng
has
gone
and
married
alice
faraday
he
thinks
he
has
a
chance
you
heard
about
that
i
suppose
yes
i
did
hear
something
about
it
of
course
edwin
wasting
his
time
really
i
happen
to
know
miss
plummer
sank
her
voice
to
a
whisper
i
happen
to
know
that
maud
awfully
in
love
with
some
man
she
met
in
wales
last
year
but
the
family
wo
hear
of
it
families
are
like
that
agreed
george
nobody
knows
who
he
is
but
everybody
in
the
county
knows
all
about
it
those
things
get
about
you
know
of
course
it
out
of
the
question
maud
will
have
to
marry
somebody
awfully
rich
or
with
a
title
her
family
one
of
the
oldest
in
england
you
know
so
i
understand
it
is
as
if
she
were
the
daughter
of
lord
peebles
somebody
like
that
why
lord
peebles
well
what
i
mean
to
say
is
said
miss
plummer
with
a
silvery
echo
of
reggie
byng
he
made
his
money
in
whisky
that
better
than
spending
it
that
way
argued
george
miss
plummer
looked
puzzled
i
see
what
you
mean
she
said
a
little
vaguely
lord
marshmoreton
is
so
different
haughty
nobleman
stuff
eh
yes
so
you
think
this
mysterious
man
in
wales
has
a
chance
not
unless
he
and
maud
elope
like
reggie
byng
and
alice
that
exciting
who
would
ever
have
suspected
reggie
had
the
dash
to
do
a
thing
like
that
lord
marshmoreton
new
secretary
is
very
pretty
do
you
think
which
is
she
the
girl
in
black
with
the
golden
hair
is
she
lord
marshmoreton
secretary
yes
she
an
american
girl
i
think
she
much
nicer
than
alice
faraday
i
was
talking
to
her
before
dinner
her
name
is
dore
her
father
was
a
captain
in
the
american
army
who
died
without
leaving
her
a
penny
he
was
the
younger
son
of
a
very
distinguished
family
but
his
family
disowned
him
because
he
married
against
their
wishes
something
ought
to
be
done
to
stop
these
families
said
george
they
always
up
to
something
so
miss
dore
had
to
go
out
and
earn
her
own
living
it
must
have
been
awful
for
her
must
it
having
to
give
up
society
did
she
give
up
society
oh
yes
she
used
to
go
everywhere
in
new
york
before
her
father
died
i
think
american
girls
are
wonderful
they
have
so
much
enterprise
george
at
the
moment
was
thinking
that
it
was
in
imagination
that
they
excelled
i
wish
i
could
go
out
and
earn
my
living
said
miss
plummer
but
the
family
wo
dream
of
it
the
family
again
said
george
sympathetically
they
a
perfect
curse
i
want
to
go
on
the
stage
are
you
fond
of
the
theatre
fairly
i
love
it
have
you
seen
hubert
broadleigh
in
once
in
spring
i
afraid
i
have
he
wonderful
have
you
seen
cynthia
dane
in
woman
no
i
missed
that
one
too
perhaps
you
prefer
musical
pieces
i
saw
an
awfully
good
musical
comedy
before
i
left
town
it
called
the
girl
it
at
the
regal
theatre
have
you
seen
it
i
wrote
it
you
what
that
is
to
say
i
wrote
the
music
but
the
music
lovely
gasped
little
miss
plummer
as
if
the
fact
made
his
claim
ridiculous
i
been
humming
it
ever
since
i
ca
help
that
i
still
stick
to
it
that
i
wrote
it
you
are
george
bevan
i
am
but
miss
plummer
voice
almost
failed
here
but
i
been
dancing
to
your
music
for
years
i
got
about
fifty
of
your
records
on
the
victrola
at
home
george
blushed
however
successful
a
man
may
be
he
can
never
get
used
to
fame
at
close
range
why
that
tricky
thing
you
know
in
the
second
act
is
the
darlingest
thing
i
ever
heard
i
mad
about
it
do
you
mean
the
one
that
goes
no
the
one
that
goes
you
know
the
one
about
granny
dancing
the
shimmy
i
not
responsible
for
the
words
you
know
urged
george
hastily
those
are
wished
on
me
by
the
lyrist
i
think
the
words
are
splendid
although
poor
popper
thinks
its
improper
granny
always
doing
it
and
nobody
can
stop
her
i
loved
it
miss
plummer
leaned
forward
excitedly
she
was
an
impulsive
girl
lady
caroline
conversation
stopped
lady
caroline
turned
yes
millie
did
you
know
that
bevan
was
mr
bevan
everybody
was
listening
now
george
huddled
pinkly
in
his
chair
he
had
not
foreseen
this
shadrach
meschach
and
abednego
combined
had
never
felt
a
tithe
of
the
warmth
that
consumed
him
he
was
essentially
a
modest
young
man
mr
bevan
echoed
lady
caroline
coldly
it
was
painful
to
her
to
have
to
recognize
george
existence
on
the
same
planet
as
herself
to
admire
him
as
miss
plummer
apparently
expected
her
to
do
was
a
loathsome
task
she
cast
one
glance
fresh
from
the
refrigerator
at
the
shrinking
george
and
elevated
her
aristocratic
eyebrows
miss
plummer
was
not
damped
she
was
at
the
age
and
george
shared
with
the
fairbanks
francis
bushman
and
one
or
two
tennis
champions
an
imposing
pedestal
in
her
hall
of
fame
you
know
george
bevan
who
wrote
the
music
of
the
girl
lady
caroline
showed
no
signs
of
thawing
she
had
not
heard
of
the
girl
her
attitude
suggested
that
while
she
admitted
the
possibility
of
george
having
disgraced
himself
in
the
manner
indicated
it
was
nothing
to
her
and
all
those
other
things
pursued
miss
plummer
indefatigably
you
must
have
heard
his
music
on
the
victrola
why
of
course
it
was
not
lady
caroline
who
spoke
but
a
man
further
down
the
table
he
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
course
by
jove
he
said
the
schenectady
shimmy
by
jove
and
all
that
ripping
everybody
seemed
pleased
and
interested
everybody
that
is
to
say
except
lady
caroline
and
lord
belpher
percy
was
feeling
that
he
had
been
tricked
he
cursed
the
imbecility
of
keggs
in
suggesting
that
this
man
should
be
invited
to
dinner
everything
had
gone
wrong
george
was
an
undoubted
success
the
majority
of
the
company
were
solid
for
him
as
far
as
exposing
his
unworthiness
in
the
eyes
of
maud
was
concerned
the
dinner
had
been
a
ghastly
failure
much
better
to
have
left
him
to
lurk
in
his
infernal
cottage
lord
belpher
drained
his
glass
moodily
he
was
seriously
upset
but
his
discomfort
at
that
moment
was
as
nothing
to
the
agony
which
rent
his
tortured
soul
a
moment
later
lord
marshmoreton
who
had
been
listening
with
growing
excitement
to
the
chorus
of
approval
rose
from
his
seat
he
cleared
his
throat
it
was
plain
that
lord
marshmoreton
had
something
on
his
mind
er
he
said
the
clatter
of
conversation
ceased
once
more
stunned
as
it
always
is
at
dinner
parties
when
one
of
the
gathering
is
seen
to
have
assumed
an
upright
position
lord
marshmoreton
cleared
his
throat
again
his
tanned
face
had
taken
on
a
deeper
hue
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
was
defying
something
or
somebody
it
was
the
look
which
ajax
had
in
his
eyes
when
he
defied
the
lightning
the
look
which
nervous
husbands
have
when
they
announce
their
intention
of
going
round
the
corner
to
bowl
a
few
games
with
the
boys
one
could
not
say
definitely
that
lord
marshmoreton
looked
on
the
other
hand
one
could
not
assert
truthfully
that
he
did
not
at
any
rate
he
was
manifestly
embarrassed
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
certain
course
of
action
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
taking
advantage
as
others
have
done
of
the
trend
of
popular
enthusiasm
and
his
state
of
mind
was
nervous
but
resolute
like
that
of
a
soldier
going
over
the
top
he
cleared
his
throat
for
the
third
time
took
one
swift
glance
at
his
sister
caroline
then
gazed
glassily
into
the
emptiness
above
her
head
take
this
opportunity
he
said
rapidly
clutching
at
the
for
support
take
this
opportunity
of
announcing
the
engagement
of
my
daughter
maud
to
bevan
and
he
concluded
with
a
rush
pouring
back
into
his
chair
i
should
like
you
all
to
drink
their
health
there
was
a
silence
that
hurt
it
was
broken
by
two
sounds
occurring
simultaneously
in
different
parts
of
the
room
one
was
a
gasp
from
lady
caroline
the
other
was
a
crash
of
glass
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
unblemished
career
keggs
the
butler
had
dropped
a
tray
chapter
out
on
the
terrace
the
night
was
very
still
from
a
sky
the
stars
looked
down
as
calmly
as
they
had
looked
on
the
night
of
the
ball
when
george
had
waited
by
the
shrubbery
listening
to
the
wailing
of
the
music
and
thinking
long
thoughts
from
the
dark
meadows
by
the
brook
came
the
cry
of
a
corncrake
its
harsh
note
softened
by
distance
what
shall
we
do
said
maud
she
was
sitting
on
the
stone
seat
where
reggie
byng
had
sat
and
meditated
on
his
love
for
alice
faraday
and
his
unfortunate
habit
of
slicing
his
to
george
as
he
stood
beside
her
she
was
a
white
blur
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
see
her
face
i
do
know
he
said
frankly
nor
did
he
like
lady
caroline
and
lord
belpher
and
keggs
the
butler
he
had
been
completely
overwhelmed
by
lord
dramatic
announcement
the
situation
had
come
upon
him
unheralded
by
any
warning
and
had
found
him
unequal
to
it
a
choking
sound
suddenly
proceeded
from
the
whiteness
that
was
maud
in
the
stillness
it
sounded
like
some
loud
noise
it
jarred
on
george
disturbed
nerves
please
i
help
it
there
nothing
to
cry
about
really
if
we
think
long
enough
we
shall
find
some
way
out
all
right
please
do
cry
i
not
crying
the
choking
sound
became
an
unmistakable
ripple
of
mirth
it
so
absurd
poor
father
getting
up
like
that
in
front
of
everyone
did
you
see
aunt
caroline
face
it
haunts
me
still
said
george
i
shall
never
forget
it
your
brother
did
seem
any
too
pleased
either
maud
stopped
laughing
it
an
awful
position
she
said
soberly
the
announcement
will
be
in
the
morning
post
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
then
the
letters
of
congratulation
will
begin
to
pour
in
and
after
that
the
presents
and
i
simply
ca
see
how
we
can
convince
them
all
that
there
has
been
a
mistake
another
aspect
of
the
matter
struck
her
it
so
hard
on
you
too
do
think
about
me
urged
george
heaven
knows
i
give
the
whole
world
if
we
could
just
let
the
thing
go
on
but
there
no
use
discussing
impossibilities
he
lowered
his
voice
there
no
use
either
in
my
pretending
that
i
not
going
to
have
a
pretty
bad
time
but
we
wo
discuss
that
it
was
my
own
fault
i
came
butting
in
on
your
life
of
my
own
free
will
and
whatever
happens
it
been
worth
it
to
have
known
you
and
tried
to
be
of
service
to
you
you
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
i
glad
you
think
that
the
best
and
kindest
friend
any
girl
ever
had
i
wish
she
broke
off
oh
well
there
was
a
silence
in
the
castle
somebody
had
begun
to
play
the
piano
then
a
man
voice
began
to
sing
that
edwin
plummer
said
maud
how
badly
he
sings
george
laughed
somehow
the
intrusion
of
plummer
had
removed
the
tension
plummer
whether
designedly
and
as
a
sombre
commentary
on
the
situation
or
because
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
does
sing
that
particular
song
was
chanting
tosti
he
was
giving
to
its
never
very
cheery
notes
a
wailing
melancholy
all
his
own
a
dog
in
the
stables
began
to
howl
in
sympathy
and
with
the
sound
came
a
curious
soothing
of
george
nerves
he
might
feel
later
but
for
the
moment
with
this
double
accompaniment
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
with
humour
in
his
soul
to
dwell
on
the
deeper
emotions
plummer
and
his
canine
duettist
had
brought
him
to
earth
he
felt
calm
and
practical
we
better
talk
the
whole
thing
over
quietly
he
said
certain
to
be
some
solution
at
the
worst
you
can
always
go
to
lord
marshmoreton
and
tell
him
that
he
spoke
without
a
sufficient
grasp
of
his
subject
i
could
said
maud
but
just
at
present
i
feel
as
if
rather
do
anything
else
in
the
world
you
do
realize
what
it
must
have
cost
father
to
defy
aunt
caroline
openly
like
that
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
to
notice
anything
i
seen
how
she
dominated
him
it
was
aunt
caroline
who
really
caused
all
this
trouble
if
it
had
only
been
father
i
could
have
coaxed
him
to
let
me
marry
anyone
i
pleased
i
wish
if
you
possibly
can
you
would
think
of
some
other
solution
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
telling
you
said
george
that
i
called
at
belgrave
square
as
you
asked
me
to
do
i
went
there
directly
i
had
seen
reggie
byng
safely
married
did
you
see
him
married
i
was
best
man
dear
old
reggie
i
hope
he
will
be
happy
he
will
do
worry
about
that
well
as
i
was
saying
i
called
at
belgrave
square
and
found
the
house
shut
up
i
could
get
any
answer
to
the
bell
though
i
kept
my
thumb
on
it
for
minutes
at
a
time
i
think
they
must
have
gone
abroad
again
no
it
was
that
i
had
a
letter
from
geoffrey
this
morning
his
uncle
died
of
apoplexy
while
they
were
in
manchester
on
a
business
trip
she
paused
he
left
geoffrey
all
his
money
she
went
on
every
penny
the
silence
seemed
to
stretch
out
interminably
the
music
from
the
castle
had
ceased
the
quiet
of
the
summer
night
was
unbroken
to
george
the
stillness
had
a
touch
of
the
sinister
it
was
the
ghastly
silence
of
the
end
of
the
world
with
a
shock
he
realized
that
even
now
he
had
been
permitting
himself
to
hope
futile
as
he
recognized
the
hope
to
be
maud
had
told
him
she
loved
another
man
that
should
have
been
final
and
yet
somehow
his
indomitable
self
had
refused
to
accept
it
as
final
but
this
news
ended
everything
the
only
obstacle
that
had
held
maud
and
this
man
apart
was
removed
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
them
marrying
george
was
conscious
of
a
vast
depression
the
last
strand
of
the
rope
had
parted
and
he
was
drifting
alone
out
into
the
ocean
of
desolation
oh
he
said
and
was
surprised
that
his
voice
sounded
very
much
the
same
as
usual
speech
was
so
difficult
that
it
seemed
strange
that
it
should
show
no
signs
of
effort
that
alters
everything
does
it
he
said
in
his
letter
that
he
wanted
me
to
meet
him
in
london
and
talk
things
over
i
suppose
there
nothing
now
to
prevent
your
going
i
mean
now
that
your
father
has
made
this
announcement
you
are
free
to
go
where
you
please
yes
i
suppose
i
am
there
was
another
silence
everything
so
difficult
said
maud
in
what
way
oh
i
do
know
if
you
are
thinking
of
me
said
george
please
do
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
you
are
hating
the
thought
of
hurting
my
feelings
i
wish
you
would
look
on
me
as
having
no
feelings
all
i
want
is
to
see
you
happy
as
i
said
just
now
it
enough
for
me
to
know
that
i
helped
you
do
be
reasonable
about
it
the
fact
that
our
engagement
has
been
officially
announced
makes
no
difference
in
our
relations
to
each
other
as
far
as
we
two
are
concerned
we
are
exactly
where
we
were
the
last
time
we
met
it
no
worse
for
me
now
than
it
was
then
to
know
that
i
not
the
man
you
love
and
that
there
somebody
else
you
loved
before
you
ever
knew
of
my
existence
for
goodness
sake
a
girl
like
you
must
be
used
to
having
men
tell
her
that
they
love
her
and
having
to
tell
them
that
she
ca
love
them
in
return
but
you
so
different
not
a
bit
of
it
i
just
one
of
the
crowd
i
never
known
anybody
quite
like
you
well
you
never
known
anybody
quite
like
plummer
i
should
imagine
but
the
thought
of
his
sufferings
did
break
your
heart
i
known
a
million
men
exactly
like
edwin
plummer
said
maud
emphatically
all
the
men
i
ever
have
known
have
been
like
him
quite
nice
and
pleasant
and
negative
it
never
seemed
to
matter
refusing
them
one
knew
that
they
would
be
just
a
little
bit
piqued
for
a
week
or
two
and
then
wander
off
and
fall
in
love
with
somebody
else
but
you
different
you
matter
that
is
where
we
disagree
my
argument
is
that
where
your
happiness
is
concerned
i
do
matter
maud
rested
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
stared
out
into
the
velvet
darkness
you
ought
to
have
been
my
brother
instead
of
percy
she
said
at
last
what
chums
we
should
have
been
and
how
simple
that
would
have
made
everything
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
regard
me
as
an
honorary
brother
that
will
make
everything
simple
it
easy
to
talk
like
that
no
it
is
it
horribly
hard
i
know
exactly
how
difficult
it
is
for
you
to
talk
as
you
have
been
doing
to
try
to
make
me
feel
better
by
pretending
the
whole
trouble
is
just
a
trifle
it
strange
we
have
only
met
really
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
three
weeks
ago
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
person
as
you
but
somehow
i
seem
to
know
everything
you
thinking
i
never
felt
like
that
before
with
any
man
even
geoffrey
he
always
puzzled
me
she
broke
off
the
corncrake
began
to
call
again
out
in
the
distance
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
tell
you
in
two
words
what
to
do
the
whole
thing
is
absurdly
simple
you
love
this
man
and
he
loves
you
and
all
that
kept
you
apart
before
was
the
fact
that
he
could
not
afford
to
marry
you
now
that
he
is
rich
there
is
no
obstacle
at
all
i
simply
let
you
look
on
me
and
my
feelings
as
an
obstacle
rule
me
out
altogether
your
father
mistake
has
made
the
situation
a
little
more
complicated
than
it
need
have
been
but
that
can
easily
be
remedied
imitate
the
excellent
example
of
reggie
byng
he
was
in
a
position
where
it
would
have
been
embarrassing
to
announce
what
he
intended
to
do
so
he
very
sensibly
went
quietly
off
and
did
it
and
left
everybody
to
find
out
after
it
was
done
i
bound
to
say
i
never
looked
on
reggie
as
a
master
mind
but
when
it
came
to
find
a
way
out
of
embarrassing
situations
one
has
to
admit
he
had
the
right
idea
do
what
he
did
maud
started
she
half
rose
from
the
stone
seat
george
could
hear
the
quick
intake
of
her
breath
you
mean
run
away
exactly
run
away
an
automobile
swung
round
the
corner
of
the
castle
from
the
direction
of
the
garage
and
drew
up
purring
at
the
steps
there
was
a
flood
of
light
and
the
sound
of
voices
as
the
great
door
opened
maud
rose
people
are
leaving
she
said
i
did
know
it
was
so
late
she
stood
irresolutely
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
in
and
say
but
i
do
think
i
can
stay
where
you
are
nobody
will
see
you
more
automobiles
arrived
the
quiet
of
the
night
was
shattered
by
the
noise
of
their
engines
maud
sat
down
again
i
suppose
they
will
think
it
very
odd
of
me
not
being
there
never
mind
what
people
think
reggie
byng
did
maud
foot
traced
circles
on
the
dry
turf
what
a
lovely
night
she
said
there
no
dew
at
all
the
automobiles
snorted
tooted
and
passed
away
their
clamour
died
in
the
distance
leaving
the
night
a
thing
of
peace
and
magic
once
more
the
door
of
the
castle
closed
with
a
bang
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
going
in
now
said
maud
i
suppose
so
and
i
ought
to
be
there
too
politely
making
my
farewells
but
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
lady
caroline
and
your
brother
will
be
quite
ready
to
dispense
with
the
formalities
i
shall
go
home
they
faced
each
other
in
the
darkness
would
you
really
do
that
asked
maud
run
away
i
mean
and
get
married
in
london
it
the
only
thing
to
do
but
can
one
get
married
as
quickly
as
that
at
a
registrar
nothing
simpler
you
should
have
seen
reggie
byng
wedding
it
was
over
before
one
realized
it
had
started
a
snuffy
little
man
in
a
black
coat
with
a
cold
in
his
head
asked
a
few
questions
wrote
a
few
words
and
the
thing
was
done
that
sounds
rather
dreadful
reggie
did
seem
to
think
so
unromantic
i
mean
prosaic
you
would
supply
the
romance
of
course
one
ought
to
be
sensible
it
is
just
the
same
as
a
regular
wedding
in
effects
absolutely
they
moved
up
the
terrace
together
on
the
gravel
drive
by
the
steps
they
paused
i
do
it
said
maud
george
had
to
make
an
effort
before
he
could
reply
for
all
his
sane
and
convincing
arguments
he
could
not
check
a
pang
at
this
definite
acceptance
of
them
he
had
begun
to
appreciate
now
the
strain
under
which
he
had
been
speaking
you
must
he
said
well
there
was
light
on
the
drive
he
could
see
her
face
her
eyes
were
troubled
what
will
you
do
she
asked
do
i
mean
are
you
going
to
stay
on
in
your
cottage
no
i
hardly
think
i
could
do
that
i
shall
go
back
to
london
tomorrow
and
stay
at
the
carlton
for
a
few
days
then
i
shall
sail
for
america
there
are
a
couple
of
pieces
i
got
to
do
for
the
fall
i
ought
to
be
starting
on
them
maud
looked
away
you
got
your
work
she
said
almost
inaudibly
george
understood
her
yes
i
got
my
work
i
glad
she
held
out
her
hand
you
been
very
wonderful
right
from
the
beginning
you
been
oh
what
the
use
of
me
saying
anything
i
had
my
reward
i
known
you
we
friends
are
we
my
best
friend
pals
pals
they
shook
hands
chapter
i
was
never
so
upset
in
my
life
said
lady
caroline
she
had
been
saying
the
same
thing
and
many
other
things
for
the
past
five
minutes
until
the
departure
of
the
last
guest
she
had
kept
an
icy
command
of
herself
and
shown
an
unruffled
front
to
the
world
she
had
even
contrived
to
smile
but
now
with
the
final
automobile
whirring
homewards
she
had
thrown
off
the
mask
the
very
furniture
of
lord
marshmoreton
study
seemed
to
shrink
seared
by
the
flame
of
her
wrath
as
for
lord
marshmoreton
himself
he
looked
quite
shrivelled
it
had
not
been
an
easy
matter
to
bring
her
erring
brother
to
bay
the
hunt
had
been
in
progress
full
ten
minutes
before
she
and
lord
belpher
finally
cornered
the
poor
wretch
his
plea
through
the
keyhole
of
the
locked
door
that
he
was
working
on
the
family
history
and
could
not
be
disturbed
was
ignored
and
now
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
avengers
i
can
not
understand
it
continued
lady
caroline
you
know
that
for
months
we
have
all
been
straining
every
nerve
to
break
off
this
horrible
entanglement
and
just
as
we
had
begun
to
hope
that
something
might
be
done
you
announce
the
engagement
in
the
most
public
manner
i
think
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
i
can
hardly
believe
even
now
that
this
appalling
thing
has
happened
i
am
hoping
that
i
shall
wake
up
and
find
it
is
all
a
nightmare
how
you
can
have
done
such
a
thing
i
can
not
understand
quite
said
lord
belpher
if
lady
caroline
was
upset
there
are
no
words
in
the
language
that
will
adequately
describe
the
emotions
of
percy
from
the
very
start
of
this
lamentable
episode
in
high
life
percy
had
been
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
it
was
percy
who
had
had
his
best
hat
smitten
from
his
head
in
the
full
view
of
all
piccadilly
it
was
percy
who
had
suffered
arrest
and
imprisonment
in
the
cause
it
was
percy
who
had
been
crippled
for
days
owing
to
his
zeal
in
tracking
maud
across
country
and
now
all
his
sufferings
were
in
vain
he
had
been
betrayed
by
his
own
father
there
was
so
the
historians
of
the
middle
west
tell
us
a
man
of
chicago
named
young
who
once
when
his
nerves
were
unstrung
put
his
mother
unseen
in
the
and
canned
her
and
labelled
her
tongue
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
glance
of
disapproval
which
percy
cast
upon
his
father
at
this
juncture
would
have
been
unduly
severe
if
cast
by
the
young
offspring
upon
their
parent
at
the
moment
of
confession
lord
marshmoreton
had
rallied
from
his
initial
panic
the
spirit
of
revolt
began
to
burn
again
in
his
bosom
once
the
die
is
cast
for
revolution
there
can
be
no
looking
back
one
must
defy
not
apologize
perhaps
the
inherited
tendencies
of
a
line
of
ancestors
who
whatever
their
shortcomings
had
at
least
known
how
to
treat
their
women
folk
came
to
his
aid
possibly
there
stood
by
his
side
in
this
crisis
ghosts
of
dead
and
buried
marshmoretons
whispering
spectral
encouragement
in
his
ear
the
ghosts
let
us
suppose
of
that
earl
who
in
the
days
of
the
seventh
henry
had
stabbed
his
wife
with
a
dagger
to
cure
her
tendency
to
lecture
him
at
night
or
of
that
other
earl
who
at
a
previous
date
in
the
annals
of
the
family
had
caused
two
aunts
and
a
sister
to
be
poisoned
apparently
from
a
mere
whim
at
any
rate
lord
marshmoreton
produced
from
some
source
sufficient
courage
to
talk
back
silly
nonsense
he
grunted
do
see
what
you
making
all
this
fuss
about
maud
loves
the
fellow
i
like
the
fellow
perfectly
decent
fellow
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
why
should
i
announce
the
engagement
you
must
be
mad
cried
lady
caroline
your
only
daughter
and
a
man
nobody
knows
anything
about
quite
said
percy
lord
marshmoreton
seized
his
advantage
with
the
skill
of
an
adroit
debater
that
where
you
wrong
i
know
all
about
him
he
a
very
rich
man
you
heard
the
way
all
those
people
at
dinner
behaved
when
they
heard
his
name
very
celebrated
man
makes
thousands
of
pounds
a
year
perfectly
suitable
match
in
every
way
it
is
not
a
suitable
match
said
lady
caroline
vehemently
i
do
care
whether
this
bevan
makes
thousands
of
pounds
a
year
or
the
match
is
not
suitable
money
is
not
everything
she
broke
off
a
knock
had
come
on
the
door
the
door
opened
and
billie
dore
came
in
a
girl
she
had
foreseen
that
lord
marshmoreton
might
be
glad
of
a
change
of
subject
at
about
this
time
would
you
like
me
to
help
you
tonight
she
asked
brightly
i
thought
i
would
ask
if
there
was
anything
you
wanted
me
to
do
lady
caroline
snatched
hurriedly
at
her
aristocratic
calm
she
resented
the
interruption
acutely
but
her
manner
when
she
spoke
was
bland
lord
marshmoreton
will
not
require
your
help
tonight
she
said
he
will
not
be
working
good
night
said
billie
good
night
said
lady
caroline
percy
scowled
a
valediction
money
resumed
lady
caroline
is
immaterial
maud
is
in
no
position
to
be
obliged
to
marry
a
rich
man
what
makes
the
thing
impossible
is
that
bevan
is
nobody
he
comes
from
nowhere
he
has
no
social
standing
whatsoever
do
see
it
said
lord
marshmoreton
the
fellow
a
thoroughly
decent
fellow
that
all
that
matters
how
can
you
be
so
you
are
talking
like
an
imbecile
your
secretary
miss
dore
is
a
nice
girl
but
how
would
you
feel
if
percy
were
to
come
to
you
and
say
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
her
exactly
said
percy
quite
lord
marshmoreton
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
he
did
it
with
a
certain
dignity
but
there
was
a
strange
hunted
expression
in
his
eyes
that
would
be
impossible
he
said
precisely
said
his
sister
i
am
glad
that
you
admit
it
lord
marshmoreton
had
reached
the
door
and
was
standing
holding
the
handle
he
seemed
to
gather
strength
from
its
support
i
been
meaning
to
tell
you
about
that
he
said
about
what
about
miss
dore
i
married
her
myself
last
wednesday
said
lord
marshmoreton
and
disappeared
like
a
diving
duck
chapter
at
a
quarter
past
four
in
the
afternoon
two
days
after
the
memorable
at
which
lord
marshmoreton
had
behaved
with
so
notable
a
lack
of
judgment
maud
sat
in
ye
cosy
nooke
waiting
for
geoffrey
raymond
he
had
said
in
his
telegram
that
he
would
meet
her
there
at
but
eagerness
had
brought
maud
to
the
tryst
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ahead
of
time
and
already
the
sadness
of
her
surroundings
was
causing
her
to
regret
this
impulsiveness
depression
had
settled
upon
her
spirit
she
was
aware
of
something
that
resembled
foreboding
ye
cosy
nooke
as
its
name
will
immediately
suggest
to
those
who
know
their
london
is
a
in
bond
street
conducted
by
distressed
gentlewomen
in
london
when
a
gentlewoman
becomes
distressed
which
she
seems
to
do
on
the
slightest
provocation
she
collects
about
her
two
or
three
other
distressed
gentlewomen
forming
a
quorum
and
starts
a
in
the
which
she
calls
ye
oak
leaf
ye
olde
ye
or
ye
snug
harbour
according
to
personal
taste
there
dressed
in
tyrolese
japanese
norwegian
or
some
other
exotic
costume
she
and
her
associates
administer
refreshments
of
an
afternoon
with
a
proud
languor
calculated
to
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
the
cheeriest
customer
here
you
will
find
none
of
the
coarse
bustle
and
efficiency
of
the
rival
establishments
of
lyons
and
nor
the
glitter
and
gaiety
of
rumpelmayer
these
places
have
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
they
rely
for
their
effect
on
an
insufficiency
of
light
an
almost
total
lack
of
ventilation
a
property
chocolate
cake
which
you
are
not
supposed
to
cut
and
the
sad
aloofness
of
their
ministering
angels
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
world
more
damping
to
the
spirit
than
a
london
of
this
kind
unless
it
be
another
london
of
the
same
kind
maud
sat
and
waited
somewhere
out
of
sight
a
kettle
bubbled
in
an
undertone
like
a
whispering
pessimist
across
the
room
two
distressed
gentlewomen
in
fancy
dress
leaned
against
the
wall
they
too
were
whispering
their
expressions
suggested
that
they
looked
on
life
as
low
and
wished
they
were
well
out
of
it
like
the
body
upstairs
one
assumed
that
there
was
a
body
upstairs
one
can
not
help
it
at
these
places
one
first
thought
on
entering
is
that
the
lady
assistant
will
approach
one
and
ask
in
a
hushed
voice
tea
or
chocolate
and
would
you
care
to
view
the
remains
maud
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
twenty
past
four
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
had
only
been
there
five
minutes
but
the
ticking
of
the
watch
assured
her
that
it
had
not
stopped
her
depression
deepened
why
had
geoffrey
told
her
to
meet
him
in
a
cavern
of
gloom
like
this
instead
of
at
the
savoy
she
would
have
enjoyed
the
savoy
but
here
she
seemed
to
have
lost
beyond
recovery
the
first
gay
eagerness
with
which
she
had
set
out
to
meet
the
man
she
loved
suddenly
she
began
to
feel
frightened
some
evil
spirit
possibly
the
kettle
seemed
to
whisper
to
her
that
she
had
been
foolish
in
coming
here
to
cast
doubts
on
what
she
had
hitherto
regarded
as
the
one
fact
in
the
world
her
love
for
geoffrey
could
she
have
changed
since
those
days
in
wales
life
had
been
so
confusing
of
late
in
the
vividness
of
recent
happenings
those
days
in
wales
seemed
a
long
way
off
and
she
herself
different
from
the
girl
of
a
year
ago
she
found
herself
thinking
about
george
bevan
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
the
moment
she
began
to
think
of
george
bevan
she
felt
better
it
was
as
if
she
had
lost
her
way
in
a
wilderness
and
had
met
a
friend
there
was
something
so
capable
so
soothing
about
george
and
how
well
he
had
behaved
at
that
last
interview
george
seemed
somehow
to
be
part
of
her
life
she
could
not
imagine
a
life
in
which
he
had
no
share
and
he
was
at
this
moment
probably
packing
to
return
to
america
and
she
would
never
see
him
again
something
stabbed
at
her
heart
it
was
as
if
she
were
realizing
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
really
going
she
tried
to
rid
herself
of
the
ache
at
her
heart
by
thinking
of
wales
she
closed
her
eyes
and
found
that
that
helped
her
to
remember
with
her
eyes
shut
she
could
bring
it
all
back
that
rainy
day
the
graceful
supple
figure
that
had
come
to
her
out
of
the
mist
those
walks
over
the
hills
if
only
geoffrey
would
come
it
was
the
sight
of
him
that
she
needed
there
you
are
maud
opened
her
eyes
with
a
start
the
voice
had
sounded
like
geoffrey
but
it
was
a
stranger
who
stood
by
the
table
and
not
a
particularly
prepossessing
stranger
in
the
dim
light
of
ye
cosy
nooke
to
which
her
opening
eyes
had
not
yet
grown
accustomed
all
she
could
see
of
the
man
was
that
he
was
remarkably
stout
she
stiffened
defensively
this
was
what
a
girl
who
sat
about
in
alone
had
to
expect
hope
i
not
late
said
the
stranger
sitting
down
and
breathing
heavily
i
thought
a
little
exercise
would
do
me
good
so
i
walked
every
nerve
in
maud
body
seemed
to
come
to
life
simultaneously
she
tingled
from
head
to
foot
it
was
geoffrey
he
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
endeavouring
by
snapping
his
fingers
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
nearest
distressed
gentlewoman
and
this
gave
maud
time
to
recover
from
the
frightful
shock
she
had
received
her
dizziness
left
her
and
leaving
was
succeeded
by
a
panic
dismay
this
could
be
geoffrey
it
was
outrageous
that
it
should
be
geoffrey
and
yet
it
undeniably
was
geoffrey
for
a
year
she
had
prayed
that
geoffrey
might
be
given
back
to
her
and
the
gods
had
heard
her
prayer
they
had
given
her
back
geoffrey
and
with
a
careless
generosity
they
had
given
her
twice
as
much
of
him
as
she
had
expected
she
had
asked
for
the
slim
apollo
whom
she
had
loved
in
wales
and
this
colossal
changeling
had
arrived
in
his
stead
we
all
of
us
have
our
prejudices
maud
had
a
prejudice
against
fat
men
it
may
have
been
the
spectacle
of
her
brother
percy
bulging
more
and
more
every
year
she
had
known
him
that
had
caused
this
kink
in
her
character
at
any
rate
it
existed
and
she
gazed
in
sickened
silence
at
geoffrey
he
had
turned
again
now
and
she
was
enabled
to
get
a
full
and
complete
view
of
him
he
was
not
merely
stout
he
was
gross
the
slim
figure
which
had
haunted
her
for
a
year
had
spread
into
a
sea
of
waistcoat
the
keen
lines
of
his
face
had
disappeared
altogether
his
cheeks
were
pink
jellies
one
of
the
distressed
gentlewomen
had
approached
with
a
slow
disdain
and
was
standing
by
the
table
brooding
on
the
corpse
upstairs
it
seemed
a
shame
to
bother
her
tea
or
chocolate
she
inquired
proudly
tea
please
said
maud
finding
her
voice
one
tea
sighed
the
mourner
chocolate
for
me
said
geoffrey
briskly
with
the
air
of
one
discoursing
on
a
congenial
topic
i
like
plenty
of
whipped
cream
and
please
see
that
it
hot
one
chocolate
geoffrey
pondered
this
was
no
light
matter
that
occupied
him
and
bring
some
fancy
cakes
i
like
the
ones
with
icing
on
them
and
some
and
buttered
toast
please
see
plenty
of
butter
on
it
maud
shivered
this
man
before
her
was
a
man
in
whose
lexicon
there
should
have
been
no
such
word
as
butter
a
man
who
should
have
called
for
the
police
had
some
enemy
endeavoured
to
thrust
butter
upon
him
well
said
geoffrey
leaning
forward
as
the
haughty
ministrant
drifted
away
you
have
changed
a
bit
to
look
at
i
mean
no
said
maud
you
just
the
same
i
think
i
he
squinted
down
at
his
waistcoat
have
put
on
a
little
weight
i
do
know
if
you
notice
it
maud
shivered
again
he
thought
he
had
put
on
a
little
weight
and
did
know
if
she
had
noticed
it
she
was
oppressed
by
the
eternal
melancholy
miracle
of
the
fat
man
who
does
not
realize
that
he
has
become
fat
it
was
living
on
the
yacht
that
put
me
a
little
out
of
condition
said
geoffrey
i
was
on
the
yacht
nearly
all
the
time
since
i
saw
you
last
the
old
boy
had
a
japanese
cook
and
lived
pretty
high
it
was
apoplexy
that
got
him
we
had
a
great
time
touring
about
we
were
on
the
mediterranean
all
last
winter
mostly
at
nice
i
should
like
to
go
to
nice
said
maud
for
something
to
say
she
was
feeling
that
it
was
not
only
externally
that
geoffrey
had
changed
or
had
he
in
reality
always
been
like
this
commonplace
and
prosaic
and
was
it
merely
in
her
imagination
that
he
had
been
wonderful
if
you
ever
go
said
geoffrey
earnestly
do
fail
to
lunch
at
the
hotel
côte
they
give
you
the
most
amazing
selection
of
hors
you
ever
saw
crayfish
as
big
as
baby
lobsters
and
there
a
fish
i
forgotten
it
name
it
come
back
to
me
that
just
like
the
florida
pompano
be
careful
to
have
it
broiled
not
fried
otherwise
you
lose
the
flavour
tell
the
waiter
you
must
have
it
broiled
with
melted
butter
and
a
little
parsley
and
some
plain
boiled
potatoes
it
really
astonishing
it
best
to
stick
to
fish
on
the
continent
people
can
say
what
they
like
but
i
maintain
that
the
french
do
really
understand
steaks
or
any
sort
of
red
meat
the
veal
is
bad
though
i
prefer
our
way
of
serving
it
of
course
what
the
french
are
real
geniuses
at
is
the
omelet
i
remember
when
we
put
in
at
toulon
for
coal
i
went
ashore
for
a
stroll
and
had
the
most
delicious
omelet
with
chicken
livers
beautifully
cooked
at
quite
a
small
unpretentious
place
near
the
harbour
i
shall
always
remember
it
the
mourner
returned
bearing
a
laden
tray
from
which
she
removed
the
funeral
bakemeats
and
placed
them
limply
on
the
table
geoffrey
shook
his
head
annoyed
i
particularly
asked
for
plenty
of
butter
on
my
toast
he
said
i
hate
buttered
toast
if
there
is
lots
of
butter
it
worth
eating
get
me
a
couple
of
pats
will
you
and
i
spread
it
myself
do
hurry
please
before
the
toast
gets
cold
it
no
good
if
the
toast
gets
cold
they
do
understand
tea
as
a
meal
at
these
places
he
said
to
maud
as
the
mourner
withdrew
you
have
to
go
to
the
country
to
appreciate
the
real
thing
i
remember
we
lay
off
lyme
regis
down
devonshire
way
for
a
few
days
and
i
went
and
had
tea
at
a
farmhouse
there
it
was
quite
amazing
thick
devonshire
cream
and
jam
and
cakes
of
every
kind
this
sort
of
thing
here
is
just
a
farce
i
do
wish
that
woman
would
make
haste
with
that
butter
it
be
too
late
in
a
minute
maud
sipped
her
tea
in
silence
her
heart
was
like
lead
within
her
the
recurrence
of
the
butter
theme
as
a
sort
of
in
her
companion
conversation
was
fraying
her
nerves
till
she
felt
she
could
endure
little
more
she
cast
her
mind
eye
back
over
the
horrid
months
and
had
a
horrid
vision
of
geoffrey
steadily
absorbing
butter
day
after
day
week
after
week
ever
becoming
more
and
more
of
a
human
keg
she
shuddered
indignation
at
the
injustice
of
fate
in
causing
her
to
give
her
heart
to
a
man
and
then
changing
him
into
another
and
quite
different
man
fought
with
a
cold
terror
which
grew
as
she
realized
more
and
more
clearly
the
magnitude
of
the
mistake
she
had
made
she
felt
that
she
must
escape
and
yet
how
could
she
escape
she
had
definitely
pledged
herself
to
this
man
ah
cried
geoffrey
gaily
as
the
pats
of
butter
arrived
that
more
like
it
he
began
to
smear
the
toast
maud
averted
her
eyes
she
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
that
he
was
the
whole
world
to
her
that
there
never
would
be
anyone
else
he
had
come
to
claim
her
how
could
she
refuse
him
just
because
he
was
about
thirty
pounds
overweight
geoffrey
finished
his
meal
he
took
out
a
cigarette
no
smoking
please
said
the
distressed
gentlewoman
he
put
the
cigarette
back
in
its
case
there
was
a
new
expression
in
his
eyes
now
a
tender
expression
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
met
maud
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
man
she
had
loved
in
wales
butter
appeared
to
have
softened
geoffrey
so
you
could
wait
he
said
with
pathos
maud
did
not
understand
i
waited
over
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
you
who
were
late
i
do
mean
that
i
am
referring
to
your
engagement
i
saw
the
announcement
in
the
morning
post
well
i
hope
you
will
let
me
offer
you
my
best
wishes
this
george
bevan
whoever
he
is
is
lucky
maud
had
opened
her
mouth
to
explain
to
say
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
she
closed
it
again
without
speaking
so
you
could
wait
proceeded
geoffrey
with
gentle
regret
well
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
blame
you
you
are
at
an
age
when
it
is
easy
to
forget
i
had
no
right
to
hope
that
you
would
be
proof
against
a
few
months
separation
i
expected
too
much
but
it
is
ironical
is
it
there
was
i
thinking
always
of
those
days
last
summer
when
we
were
everything
to
each
other
while
you
had
forgotten
me
forgotten
me
sighed
geoffrey
he
picked
a
fragment
of
cake
absently
off
the
tablecloth
and
inserted
it
in
his
mouth
the
unfairness
of
the
attack
stung
maud
to
speech
she
looked
back
over
the
months
thought
of
all
she
had
suffered
and
ached
with
i
had
she
cried
you
had
but
you
let
this
other
man
this
george
bevan
make
love
to
you
i
did
that
was
all
a
mistake
a
mistake
yes
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
but
she
stopped
it
had
come
to
her
suddenly
in
a
flash
of
clear
vision
that
the
mistake
was
one
which
she
had
no
desire
to
correct
she
felt
like
one
who
lost
in
a
jungle
comes
out
after
long
wandering
into
the
open
air
for
days
she
had
been
thinking
confusedly
unable
to
interpret
her
own
emotions
and
now
everything
had
abruptly
become
clarified
it
was
as
if
the
sight
of
geoffrey
had
been
the
key
to
a
cipher
she
loved
george
bevan
the
man
she
had
sent
out
of
her
life
for
ever
she
knew
it
now
and
the
shock
of
realization
made
her
feel
faint
and
helpless
and
mingled
with
the
shock
of
realization
there
came
to
her
the
mortification
of
knowing
that
her
aunt
lady
caroline
and
her
brother
percy
had
been
right
after
all
what
she
had
mistaken
for
the
love
of
a
lifetime
had
been
as
they
had
so
often
insisted
a
mere
infatuation
unable
to
survive
the
spectacle
of
a
geoffrey
who
had
been
eating
too
much
butter
and
had
put
on
flesh
geoffrey
swallowed
his
piece
of
cake
and
bent
forward
are
you
engaged
to
this
man
bevan
maud
avoided
his
eye
she
was
aware
that
the
crisis
had
arrived
and
that
her
whole
future
hung
on
her
next
words
and
then
fate
came
to
her
rescue
before
she
could
speak
there
was
an
interruption
pardon
me
said
a
voice
one
moment
so
intent
had
maud
and
her
companion
been
on
their
own
affairs
that
neither
of
them
observed
the
entrance
of
a
third
party
this
was
a
young
man
with
hair
and
a
freckled
face
which
seemed
undecided
whether
to
be
furtive
or
impudent
he
had
small
eyes
and
his
costume
was
a
blend
of
the
flashy
and
the
shabby
he
wore
a
bowler
hat
tilted
a
little
rakishly
to
one
side
and
carried
a
small
bag
which
he
rested
on
the
table
between
them
sorry
to
intrude
miss
he
bowed
gallantly
to
maud
but
i
want
to
have
a
few
words
with
spenser
gray
here
maud
looking
across
at
geoffrey
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
florid
face
had
lost
much
of
its
colour
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
eyes
had
taken
a
glassy
expression
i
think
you
have
made
a
mistake
she
said
coldly
she
disliked
the
young
man
at
sight
this
is
mr
raymond
geoffrey
found
speech
of
course
i
mr
raymond
he
cried
angrily
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
and
annoying
us
like
this
the
young
man
was
not
discomposed
he
appeared
to
be
used
to
being
unpopular
he
proceeded
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
he
produced
a
dingy
card
glance
at
that
he
said
willoughby
and
son
solicitors
i
son
the
put
this
little
matter
into
my
hands
been
looking
for
you
for
days
gray
to
hand
you
this
paper
he
opened
the
bag
like
a
conjurer
performing
a
trick
and
brought
out
a
stiff
document
of
legal
aspect
you
a
witness
miss
that
i
served
the
papers
you
know
what
this
is
of
course
he
said
to
geoffrey
action
for
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
our
client
miss
yvonne
sinclair
of
the
regal
theatre
is
suing
you
for
ten
thousand
pounds
and
if
you
ask
me
said
the
young
man
with
genial
candour
dropping
the
professional
manner
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
think
it
a
it
the
best
little
action
for
breach
we
handled
for
years
he
became
professional
again
your
lawyers
will
no
doubt
communicate
with
us
in
due
course
and
if
you
take
my
advice
he
concluded
with
another
of
his
swift
changes
of
manner
you
get
to
settle
out
of
court
for
between
me
and
you
and
the
you
have
an
earthly
geoffrey
had
started
to
his
feet
he
was
puffing
with
outraged
innocence
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
this
he
demanded
ca
you
see
you
made
a
mistake
my
name
is
not
gray
this
lady
has
told
you
that
i
am
geoffrey
raymond
makes
it
all
the
worse
for
you
said
the
young
man
imperturbably
making
advances
to
our
client
under
an
assumed
name
we
got
letters
and
witnesses
and
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
and
how
about
this
photo
he
dived
into
the
bag
again
do
you
recognize
that
miss
maud
looked
at
the
photograph
it
was
unmistakably
geoffrey
and
it
had
evidently
been
taken
recently
for
it
showed
the
later
geoffrey
the
man
of
substance
it
was
a
photograph
and
across
the
stout
legs
was
written
in
a
flowing
hand
the
legend
to
babe
from
her
little
pootles
maud
gave
a
shudder
and
handed
it
back
to
the
young
man
just
as
geoffrey
reaching
across
the
table
made
a
grab
for
it
i
recognize
it
she
said
willoughby
junior
packed
the
photograph
away
in
his
bag
and
turned
to
go
that
all
for
today
then
i
think
he
said
affably
he
bowed
again
in
his
courtly
way
tilted
the
hat
a
little
more
to
the
left
and
having
greeted
one
of
the
distressed
gentlewomen
who
loitered
limply
in
his
path
with
a
polite
if
you
please
mabel
which
drew
upon
him
a
freezing
stare
of
which
he
seemed
oblivious
he
passed
out
leaving
behind
him
strained
silence
maud
was
the
first
to
break
it
i
think
i
be
going
she
said
the
words
seemed
to
rouse
her
companion
from
his
stupor
let
me
explain
there
nothing
to
explain
it
was
just
a
it
was
just
a
passing
it
was
nothing
nothing
pootles
murmured
maud
geoffrey
followed
her
as
she
moved
to
the
door
be
reasonable
pleaded
geoffrey
men
are
saints
it
was
nothing
are
you
going
to
end
everything
just
because
i
lost
my
head
maud
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
she
was
conscious
of
an
overwhelming
relief
the
dim
interior
of
ye
cosy
nooke
no
longer
seemed
depressing
she
could
have
kissed
this
unknown
babe
whose
businesslike
action
had
enabled
her
to
close
a
regrettable
chapter
in
her
life
with
a
clear
conscience
but
you
have
only
lost
your
head
geoffrey
she
said
lost
your
figure
as
well
she
went
out
quickly
with
a
convulsive
bound
geoffrey
started
to
follow
her
but
was
checked
before
he
had
gone
a
yard
there
are
formalities
to
be
observed
before
a
patron
can
leave
ye
cosy
nooke
if
you
please
said
a
distressed
gentlewomanly
voice
the
lady
whom
willoughby
had
addressed
as
mabel
erroneously
for
her
name
was
ernestine
was
standing
beside
him
with
a
slip
of
paper
six
and
twopence
said
ernestine
for
a
moment
this
appalling
statement
drew
the
unhappy
man
mind
from
the
main
issue
six
and
twopence
for
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
a
few
cakes
he
cried
aghast
it
robbery
six
and
twopence
please
said
the
queen
of
the
bandits
with
undisturbed
calm
she
had
been
through
this
sort
of
thing
before
ye
cosy
nooke
did
not
get
many
customers
but
it
made
the
most
of
those
it
did
get
here
geoffrey
produced
a
i
have
time
to
argue
the
distressed
brigand
showed
no
gratification
she
had
the
air
of
one
who
is
aloof
from
worldly
things
all
she
wanted
was
rest
and
leisure
leisure
to
meditate
upon
the
body
upstairs
all
flesh
is
as
grass
we
are
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
but
there
beyond
the
grave
is
peace
your
change
she
said
damn
the
change
you
are
forgetting
your
hat
damn
my
hat
geoffrey
dashed
from
the
room
he
heaved
his
body
through
the
door
he
lumbered
down
the
stairs
out
in
bond
street
the
traffic
moved
up
and
the
traffic
moved
down
strollers
strolled
upon
the
sidewalks
but
maud
had
gone
chapter
in
his
bedroom
at
the
carlton
hotel
george
bevan
was
packing
that
is
to
say
he
had
begun
packing
but
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
staring
into
a
future
which
became
bleaker
and
bleaker
the
more
he
examined
it
in
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
no
stranger
to
these
grey
moods
and
they
had
become
harder
and
harder
to
dispel
now
with
the
before
him
gaping
to
receive
its
contents
he
gave
himself
up
to
gloom
somehow
the
with
all
that
it
implied
of
partings
and
voyagings
seemed
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
he
was
going
out
alone
into
an
empty
world
soon
he
would
be
on
board
the
liner
every
revolution
of
whose
engines
would
be
taking
him
farther
away
from
where
his
heart
would
always
be
there
were
moments
when
the
torment
of
this
realization
became
almost
physical
it
was
incredible
that
three
short
weeks
ago
he
had
been
a
happy
man
lonely
perhaps
but
only
in
a
vague
impersonal
way
not
lonely
with
this
aching
loneliness
that
tortured
him
now
what
was
there
left
for
him
as
regards
any
triumphs
which
the
future
might
bring
in
connection
with
his
work
he
was
as
mac
the
keeper
had
said
blarzy
any
success
he
might
have
would
be
but
a
stale
repetition
of
other
successes
which
he
had
achieved
he
would
go
on
working
of
course
but
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
across
the
room
jerked
him
back
to
the
present
he
got
up
with
a
muttered
malediction
someone
calling
up
again
from
the
theatre
probably
they
had
been
doing
it
all
the
time
since
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
for
america
by
saturday
boat
hello
he
said
wearily
is
that
george
asked
a
voice
it
seemed
familiar
but
all
female
voices
sound
the
same
over
the
telephone
this
is
george
he
replied
who
are
you
do
you
know
my
voice
i
do
not
you
know
it
quite
well
before
long
i
a
great
talker
is
that
billie
it
is
not
billie
whoever
billie
may
be
i
am
female
george
so
is
billie
well
you
had
better
run
through
the
list
of
your
feminine
friends
till
you
reach
me
i
have
any
feminine
friends
none
that
odd
why
you
told
me
in
the
garden
two
nights
ago
that
you
looked
on
me
as
a
pal
george
sat
down
abruptly
he
felt
boneless
is
is
that
you
he
stammered
it
ca
be
maud
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
george
i
want
to
ask
you
one
or
two
things
in
the
first
place
are
you
fond
of
butter
george
blinked
this
was
not
a
dream
he
had
just
bumped
his
knee
against
the
corner
of
the
telephone
table
and
it
still
hurt
most
convincingly
he
needed
the
evidence
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
awake
butter
he
queried
what
do
you
mean
oh
well
if
you
do
even
know
what
butter
means
i
expect
all
right
what
is
your
weight
george
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
but
i
do
understand
wait
a
minute
there
was
a
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
about
thirteen
stone
said
maud
voice
i
been
doing
it
in
my
head
and
what
was
it
this
time
last
year
about
the
same
i
think
i
always
weigh
about
the
same
how
wonderful
george
yes
this
is
very
important
have
you
ever
been
in
florida
i
was
there
one
winter
do
you
know
a
fish
called
the
pompano
yes
tell
me
about
it
how
do
you
mean
it
just
a
fish
you
eat
it
i
know
go
into
details
there
are
any
details
you
just
eat
it
the
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
purred
with
approval
i
never
heard
anything
so
splendid
the
last
man
who
mentioned
pompano
to
me
became
absolutely
lyrical
about
sprigs
of
parsley
and
melted
butter
well
that
that
now
here
another
very
important
point
how
about
george
pressed
his
unoccupied
hand
against
his
forehead
this
conversation
was
unnerving
him
i
did
get
that
he
said
did
get
what
i
mean
i
did
quite
catch
what
you
said
that
time
it
sounded
to
me
like
about
it
was
about
why
not
but
said
george
weakly
it
does
make
any
sense
oh
but
it
does
i
mean
what
about
for
your
den
my
den
your
den
you
must
have
a
den
where
do
you
suppose
you
going
to
work
if
you
do
