candida
bernard
shaw
act
i
a
fine
october
morning
in
the
north
east
suburbs
of
london
a
vast
district
many
miles
away
from
the
london
of
mayfair
and
james
much
less
known
there
than
the
paris
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
champs
elysees
and
much
less
narrow
squalid
fetid
and
airless
in
its
slums
strong
in
comfortable
prosperous
middle
class
life
with
ugly
iron
urinals
radical
clubs
tram
lines
and
a
perpetual
stream
of
yellow
cars
enjoying
in
its
main
thoroughfares
the
luxury
of
front
gardens
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
save
as
to
the
path
from
the
gate
to
the
hall
door
but
blighted
by
an
intolerable
monotony
of
miles
and
miles
of
graceless
characterless
brick
houses
black
iron
railings
stony
pavements
slaty
roofs
and
respectably
ill
dressed
or
disreputably
poorly
dressed
people
quite
accustomed
to
the
place
and
mostly
plodding
about
somebody
else
work
which
they
would
not
do
if
they
themselves
could
help
it
the
little
energy
and
eagerness
that
crop
up
show
themselves
in
cockney
cupidity
and
business
push
even
the
policemen
and
the
chapels
are
not
infrequent
enough
to
break
the
monotony
the
sun
is
shining
cheerfully
there
is
no
fog
and
though
the
smoke
effectually
prevents
anything
whether
faces
and
hands
or
bricks
and
mortar
from
looking
fresh
and
clean
it
is
not
hanging
heavily
enough
to
trouble
a
londoner
this
desert
of
unattractiveness
has
its
oasis
near
the
outer
end
of
the
hackney
road
is
a
park
of
acres
fenced
in
not
by
railings
but
by
a
wooden
paling
and
containing
plenty
of
greensward
trees
a
lake
for
bathers
flower
beds
with
the
flowers
arranged
carefully
in
patterns
by
the
admired
cockney
art
of
carpet
gardening
and
a
sandpit
imported
from
the
seaside
for
the
delight
of
the
children
but
speedily
deserted
on
its
becoming
a
natural
vermin
preserve
for
all
the
petty
fauna
of
kingsland
hackney
and
hoxton
a
bandstand
an
unfinished
forum
for
religious
and
political
orators
cricket
pitches
a
gymnasium
and
an
old
fashioned
stone
kiosk
are
among
its
attractions
wherever
the
prospect
is
bounded
by
trees
or
rising
green
grounds
it
is
a
pleasant
place
where
the
ground
stretches
far
to
the
grey
palings
with
bricks
and
mortar
sky
signs
crowded
chimneys
and
smoke
beyond
the
prospect
makes
it
desolate
and
sordid
the
best
view
of
victoria
park
is
from
the
front
window
of
dominic
parsonage
from
which
not
a
single
chimney
is
visible
the
parsonage
is
a
villa
with
a
front
garden
and
a
porch
visitors
go
up
the
flight
of
steps
to
the
porch
tradespeople
and
members
of
the
family
go
down
by
a
door
under
the
steps
to
the
basement
with
a
breakfast
room
used
for
all
meals
in
front
and
the
kitchen
at
the
back
upstairs
on
the
level
of
the
hall
door
is
the
with
its
large
plate
glass
window
looking
on
the
park
in
this
room
the
only
that
can
be
spared
from
the
children
and
the
family
meals
the
parson
the
reverend
james
mavor
morell
does
his
work
he
is
sitting
in
a
strong
round
backed
revolving
chair
at
the
right
hand
end
of
a
long
table
which
stands
across
the
window
so
that
he
can
cheer
himself
with
the
view
of
the
park
at
his
elbow
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
adjoining
it
is
a
little
table
only
half
the
width
of
the
other
with
a
typewriter
on
it
his
typist
is
sitting
at
this
machine
with
her
back
to
the
window
the
large
table
is
littered
with
pamphlets
journals
letters
nests
of
drawers
an
office
diary
postage
scales
and
the
like
a
spare
chair
for
visitors
having
business
with
the
parson
is
in
the
middle
turned
to
his
end
within
reach
of
his
hand
is
a
stationery
case
and
a
cabinet
photograph
in
a
frame
behind
him
the
right
hand
wall
recessed
above
the
fireplace
is
fitted
with
bookshelves
on
which
an
adept
eye
can
measure
the
divinity
and
casuistry
by
a
complete
set
of
browning
poems
and
maurice
theological
essays
and
guess
at
his
politics
from
a
yellow
backed
progress
and
poverty
fabian
essays
a
dream
of
john
ball
marx
capital
and
half
a
dozen
other
literary
landmarks
in
socialism
opposite
him
on
the
left
near
the
typewriter
is
the
door
further
down
the
room
opposite
the
fireplace
a
bookcase
stands
on
a
cellaret
with
a
sofa
near
it
there
is
a
generous
fire
burning
and
the
hearth
with
a
comfortable
armchair
and
a
japanned
flower
painted
coal
scuttle
at
one
side
a
miniature
chair
for
a
boy
or
girl
on
the
other
a
nicely
varnished
wooden
mantelpiece
with
neatly
moulded
shelves
tiny
bits
of
mirror
let
into
the
panels
and
a
travelling
clock
in
a
leather
case
the
inevitable
wedding
present
and
on
the
wall
above
a
large
autotype
of
the
chief
figure
in
titian
virgin
of
the
assumption
is
very
inviting
altogether
the
room
is
the
room
of
a
good
housekeeper
vanquished
as
far
as
the
table
is
concerned
by
an
untidy
man
but
elsewhere
mistress
of
the
situation
the
furniture
in
its
ornamental
aspect
betrays
the
style
of
the
advertised
suite
of
the
pushing
suburban
furniture
dealer
but
there
is
nothing
useless
or
pretentious
in
the
room
the
paper
and
panelling
are
dark
throwing
the
big
cheery
window
and
the
park
outside
into
strong
relief
the
reverend
james
mavor
morell
is
a
christian
socialist
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
and
an
active
member
of
the
guild
of
matthew
and
the
christian
social
union
a
vigorous
genial
popular
man
of
forty
robust
and
goodlooking
full
of
energy
with
pleasant
hearty
considerate
manners
and
a
sound
unaffected
voice
which
he
uses
with
the
clean
athletic
articulation
of
a
practised
orator
and
with
a
wide
range
and
perfect
command
of
expression
he
is
a
first
rate
clergyman
able
to
say
what
he
likes
to
whom
he
likes
to
lecture
people
without
setting
himself
up
against
them
to
impose
his
authority
on
them
without
humiliating
them
and
to
interfere
in
their
business
without
impertinence
his
of
spiritual
enthusiasm
and
sympathetic
emotion
has
never
run
dry
for
a
moment
he
still
eats
and
sleeps
heartily
enough
to
win
the
daily
battle
between
exhaustion
and
recuperation
triumphantly
withal
a
great
baby
pardonably
vain
of
his
powers
and
unconsciously
pleased
with
himself
he
has
a
healthy
complexion
a
good
forehead
with
the
brows
somewhat
blunt
and
the
eyes
bright
and
eager
a
mouth
resolute
but
not
particularly
well
cut
and
a
substantial
nose
with
the
mobile
spreading
nostrils
of
the
dramatic
orator
but
like
all
his
features
void
of
subtlety
the
typist
miss
proserpine
garnett
is
a
brisk
little
woman
of
about
of
the
lower
middle
class
neatly
but
cheaply
dressed
in
a
black
merino
skirt
and
a
blouse
rather
pert
and
quick
of
speech
and
not
very
civil
in
her
manner
but
sensitive
and
affectionate
she
is
clattering
away
busily
at
her
machine
whilst
morell
opens
the
last
of
his
morning
letters
he
realizes
its
contents
with
a
comic
groan
of
despair

that

go
to
the
hoxton
group
of
freedom
instead
she
enters
the
engagement
in
silence
with
implacable
disparagement
of
the
hoxton
anarchists
in
every
line
of
her
face
morell
bursts
open
the
cover
of
a
copy
of
the
church
reformer
which
has
come
by
post
and
glances
through
stewart
hendlam
leader
and
the
guild
of
matthew
news
these
proceedings
are
presently
enlivened
by
the
appearance
of
morell
curate
the
reverend
alexander
mill
a
young
gentleman
gathered
by
morell
from
the
nearest
university
settlement
whither
he
had
come
from
oxford
to
give
the
east
end
of
london
the
benefit
of
his
university
training
he
is
a
conceitedly
well
intentioned
enthusiastic
immature
person
with
nothing
positively
unbearable
about
him
except
a
habit
of
speaking
with
his
lips
carefully
closed
for
half
an
inch
from
each
corner
a
finicking
arthulation
and
a
set
of
horribly
corrupt
vowels
notably
ow
for
o
this
being
his
chief
means
of
bringing
oxford
refinement
to
bear
on
hackney
vulgarity
morell
whom
he
has
won
over
by
a
doglike
devotion
looks
up
indulgently
from
the
church
reformer
as
he
enters
and
remarks
well
lexy
late
again
as
usual
lexy
i
afraid
so

soldier

best
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
we
are
trying
to
establish
on
earth
that
will
cure
you
of
dawdling
an
honest
man

that
he
must
pay
heaven
for
every
hour
of
happiness
with
a
good
spell
of
hard
unselfish
work
to
make
others
happy
we
have
no
more
right
to
consume
happiness
without
producing
it
than
to
consume
wealth
without
producing
it
get
a
wife
like
my
candida
and
you
always
be
in
arrear
with
your
repayment
he
pats
lexy
affectionately
on
the
back
and
is
leaving
the
room
when
lexy
calls
to
him
lexy
oh
wait
a
bit
i
forgot
morell
halts
and
turns
with
the
door
knob
in
his
hand
your
is
coming
round
to
see
you
morell
shuts
the
door
again
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
morell
surprised
and
not
pleased
burgess
lexy
yes
i
passed
him
in
the
park
arguing
with
somebody
he
gave
me
good
day
and
asked
me
to
let
you
know
that
he
was
coming
morell
half
incredulous
but
he
has
called
here
for
i
may
almost
say
for
years
are
you
sure
lexy
you
not
joking
are
you
lexy
earnestly
no
sir
really
morell
thoughtfully
hm
time
for
him
to
take
another
look
at
candida
before
she
grows
out
of
his
knowledge
he
resigns
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
goes
out
lexy
looks
after
him
with
beaming
foolish
worship
lexy
what
a
good
man
what
a
thorough
loving
soul
he
is
he
takes
morell
place
at
the
table
making
himself
very
comfortable
as
he
takes
out
a
cigaret
proserpine
impatiently
pulling
the
letter
she
has
been
working
at
off
the
typewriter
and
folding
it
oh
a
man
ought
to
be
able
to
be
fond
of
his
wife
without
making
a
fool
of
himself
about
her
lexy
shocked
oh
miss
prossy
proserpine
rising
busily
and
coming
to
the
stationery
case
to
get
an
envelope
in
which
she
encloses
the
letter
as
she
speaks
candida
here
and
candida
there
and
candida
everywhere
she
licks
the
envelope
it
enough
to
drive
anyone
out
of
their
senses
thumping
the
envelope
to
make
it
stick
to
hear
a
perfectly
commonplace
woman
raved
about
in
that
absurd
manner
merely
because
she
got
good
hair
and
a
tolerable
figure
lexy
with
reproachful
gravity
i
think
her
extremely
beautiful
miss
garnett
he
takes
the
photograph
up
looks
at
it
and
adds
with
even
greater
impressiveness
extremely
beautiful
how
fine
her
eyes
are
proserpine
her
eyes
are
not
a
bit
better
than
mine
now
he
puts
down
the
photograph
and
stares
austerely
at
her
and
you
know
very
well
that
you
think
me
dowdy
and
second
rate
enough
lexy
rising
majestically
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
think
of
any
of
god
creatures
in
such
a
way
he
moves
stiffly
away
from
her
across
the
room
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bookcase
proserpine
thank
you
that
very
nice
and
comforting
lexy
saddened
by
her
depravity
i
had
no
idea
you
had
any
feeling
against
morell
proserpine
indignantly
i
have
no
feeling
against
her
she
very
nice
very
i
very
fond
of
her
and
can
appreciate
her
real
qualities
far
better
than
any
man
can
he
shakes
his
head
sadly
and
turns
to
the
bookcase
looking
along
the
shelves
for
a
volume
she
follows
him
with
intense
pepperiness
you
do
believe
me
he
turns
and
faces
her
she
pounces
at
him
with
spitfire
energy
you
think
jealous
oh
what
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
you
have
lexy
mill
how
well
you
know
the
weaknesses
of
woman
do
you
it
must
be
so
nice
to
be
a
man
and
have
a
fine
penetrating
intellect
instead
of
mere
emotions
like
us
and
to
know
that
the
reason
we
share
your
amorous
delusions
is
that
we
all
jealous
of
one
another
she
abandons
him
with
a
toss
of
her
shoulders
and
crosses
to
the
fire
to
warm
her
hands
lexy
ah
if
you
women
only
had
the
same
clue
to

that
you
have
to
his
weakness
miss
prossy
there
would
be
no
woman
question
proserpine
over
her
shoulder
as
she
stoops
holding
her
hands
to
the
blaze
where
did
you
hear
morell
say
that
you
did
invent
it
yourself
you
not
clever
enough
lexy
that
quite
true
i
am
not
ashamed
of
owing
him
that
as
i
owe
him
so
many
other
spiritual
truths
he
said
it
at
the
annual
conference
of
the
women
liberal
federation
allow
me
to
add
that
though
they
did
appreciate
it
i
a
mere
man
did
he
turns
to
the
bookcase
again
hoping
that
this
may
leave
her
crushed
proserpine
putting
her
hair
straight
at
the
little
panel
of
mirror
in
the
mantelpiece
well
when
you
talk
to
me
give
me
your
own
ideas
such
as
they
are
and
not
his
you
never
cut
a
poorer
figure
than
when
you
are
trying
to
imitate
him
lexy
stung
i
try
to
follow
his
example
not
to
imitate
him
proserpine
coming
at
him
again
on
her
way
back
to
her
work
yes
you
do
you
imitate
him
why
do
you
tuck
your
umbrella
under
your
left
arm
instead
of
carrying
it
in
your
hand
like
anyone
else
why
do
you
walk
with
your
chin
stuck
out
before
you
hurrying
along
with
that
eager
look
in
your
eyes
you
who
never
get
up
before
half
past
nine
in
the
morning
why
do
you
say
knoaledge
in
church
though
you
always
say
knolledge
in
private
conversation
bah
do
you
think
i
do
know
she
goes
back
to
the
typewriter
here
come
and
set
about
your
work
we
wasted
enough
time
for
one
morning
here
a
copy
of
the
diary
for
she
hands
him
a
memorandum
lexy
deeply
offended
thank
you
he
takes
it
and
stands
at
the
table
with
his
back
to
her
reading
it
she
begins
to
transcribe
her
shorthand
notes
on
the
typewriter
without
troubling
herself
about
his
feelings
burgess
enters
unannounced
he
is
a
man
of
sixty
made
coarse
and
sordid
by
the
compulsory
selfishness
of
petty
commerce
and
later
on
softened
into
sluggish
bumptiousness
by
overfeeding
and
commercial
success
a
vulgar
ignorant
guzzling
man
offensive
and
contemptuous
to
people
whose
labor
is
cheap
respectful
to
wealth
and
rank
and
quite
sincere
and
without
rancour
or
envy
in
both
attitudes
finding
him
without
talent
the
world
has
offered
him
no
decently
paid
work
except
ignoble
work
and
he
has
become
in
consequence
somewhat
hoggish
but
he
has
no
suspicion
of
this
himself
and
honestly
regards
his
commercial
prosperity
as
the
inevitable
and
socially
wholesome
triumph
of
the
ability
industry
shrewdness
and
experience
in
business
of
a
man
who
in
private
is
easygoing
affectionate
and
humorously
convivial
to
a
fault
corporeally
he
is
a
podgy
man
with
a
square
clean
shaven
face
and
a
square
beard
under
his
chin
dust
colored
with
a
patch
of
grey
in
the
centre
and
small
watery
blue
eyes
with
a
plaintively
sentimental
expression
which
he
transfers
easily
to
his
voice
by
his
habit
of
pompously
intoning
his
sentences
burgess
stopping
on
the
threshold
and
looking
round
they
told
me
morell
was
here
proserpine
rising
he
upstairs
i
fetch
him
for
you
burgess

boorishly
at
her

the
same
young
lady
as
used
to
typewrite
for
him
proserpine
no
burgess
assenting
no
she
was
younger
miss
garnett
stolidly
stares
at
him
then
goes
out
with
great
dignity
he
receives
this
quite
obtusely
and
crosses
to
the
where
he
turns
and
spreads
himself
with
his
back
to
the
fire
startin
on
your
rounds
mill
lexy
folding
his
paper
and
pocketing
it
yes

about

private
between

my
silk
handkerchief

a
cold
wind
away
with
you

up
and
goes
out

your
curates
as

mornin
when
i
pay
a

an
livin
depen
on
me

keep
him
in
his
place
morell
rather
shortly
i
always
keep
my
curates
in
their
places
as
my
helpers
and
comrades
if
you
get
as
much
work
out
of
your
clerks
and
warehousemen
as
i
do
out
of
my
curates
you
must
be
getting
rich
pretty
fast
will
you
take
your
old
chair
he
points
with
curt
authority
to
the
arm
chair
beside
the
fireplace
then
takes
the
spare
chair
from
the
table
and
sits
down
in
front
of
burgess
burgess
without
moving
just
the
same
as
hever
james
morell
when
you
last
called
it
was
about
three
years
ago
i
think
you
said
the
same
thing
a
little
more
frankly
your
exact
words
then
were
just
as
big
a
fool
as
ever
james
burgess
soothingly
well
perhaps
i
did
but
with
conciliatory
cheerfulness
i
meant
no
offence
by
it
a
clergyman
is
privileged
to
be
a
bit
of
a
fool
you
know
it
becomin
in
his
profession
that
he
should
anyhow
i
come
here
not
to
rake
up
hold
differences
but
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
suddenly
becoming
very
solemn
and
approaching
morell
james
three
year
ago
you
done
me
a
hill
turn
you
done
me
hout
of
a
contrac
an
when
i
gev
you
words
in
my
disappointment
you
turned
my
daughrter
again
me
well
i
come
to
act
the
part
of
a
cherischin
offering
his
hand
i
forgive
you
james
morell
starting
up
confound
your
impudence
burgess
retreating
with
almost
lachrymose
deprecation
of
this
treatment
is
that
becomin
language
for
a
clergyman
james
and
you
so
too
morell
hotly
no
sir
it
is
not
becoming
language
for
a
clergyman
i
used
the
wrong
word
i
should
have
said
damn
your
impudence
what
paul
or
any
honest
priest
would
have
said
to
you
do
you
think
i
have
forgotten
that
tender
of
yours
for
the
contract
to
supply
clothing
to
the
workhouse
burgess
in
a
paroxysm
of
public
spirit
i
acted
in
the
interest
of
the
ratepayers
james
it
was
the
lowest
tender
you
ca
deny
that
morell
yes
the
lowest
because
you
paid
worse
wages
than
any
other
employer
starvation
wages
aye
worse
than
starvation
wages
to
the
women
who
made
the
clothing
your
wages
would
have
driven
them
to
the
streets
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
getting
angrier
and
angrier
those
women
were
my
parishioners
i
shamed
the
guardians
out
of
accepting
your
tender
i
shamed
the
ratepayers
out
of
letting
them
do
it
i
shamed
everybody
but
you
boiling
over
how
dare
you
sir
come
here
and
offer
to
forgive
me
and
talk
about
your
daughter
and
burgess
easy

fluster
about

you
i
did
hear
you
burgess
of
course
i
did
i
hown
it
now
come
i
harsk
your
pardon
for
the
letter
i

morell
snapping
his
fingers
that

moddle
hemployer

the
work

done
by

hour
and
the
skilled
gits
the
trade
union
rate
proudly
what
you
to
say
to
me
now
morell
overwhelmed
is
it
possible
well
there
more
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
going
to
burgess
with
an
explosion
of
apologetic
cordiality
my
dear
burgess
i
most
heartily
beg
your
pardon
for
my
hard
thoughts
of
you
grasps
his
hand
and
now

feel
the
better
for
the
change
come
confess
you
happier

look
happier
burgess
ruefully
well
i
do
i
i
must
since
you
notice
it
at
all
events
i
git
my
contrax
asseppit
accepted
by
the
county
council
savagely
they
nothink
to
do
with
me
unless
i
paid
fair
wages
curse
for
a
parcel
o
meddlin
fools
morell
dropping
his
hand
utterly
discouraged
so
that
was
why
you
raised
the
wages
he
sits
down
moodily
burgess
severely
in
spreading
mounting
tones
why
else
should
i
do
it
what
does
it
lead
to
but
drink
and
huppishness
in
workin
men
he
seats
himself
magisterially
in
the
easy
chair
it
hall
very
well
for
you
james
it
gits
you
hinto
the
papers
and
makes
a
great
man
of
you
but
you
never
think
of
the
you
do
puttin
money
into
the
pockets
of
workin
men
that
they
do
know
to
spend
and
takin
it
from
people
that
might
be
makin
a
good
huse
on
it
morell
with
a
heavy
sigh
speaking
with
cold
politeness
what
is
your
business
with
me
this
morning
i
shall
not
pretend
to
believe
that
you
are
here
merely
out
of
family
sentiment
burgess
obstinately
yes
i
ham
just
family
sentiment
and
nothink
else
morell
with
weary
calm
i
do
believe
you
burgess
rising
threateningly
do
say
that
to
me
again
james
mavor
morell
morell
unmoved
i
say
it
just
as
often
as
may
be
necessary
to
convince
you
that
it
true
i
do
believe
you
burgess
collapsing
into
an
abyss
of
wounded
feeling
oh
well
if
you
determined
to
be
unfriendly
i
i
better
go
he
moves
reluctantly
towards
the
door
morell
makes
no
sign
he
lingers
i
did
hexpect
to
find
a
hunforgivin
spirit
in
you
james
morell
still
not
responding
he
takes
a
few
more
reluctant
steps
doorwards
then
he
comes
back
whining
we
huseter
git
on
well
enough
spite
of
our
different
opinions
why
are
you
so
changed
to
me
i
give
you
my
word
i
come
here
in
pyorr
pure
frenliness
not
wishin
to
be
on
bad
terms
with
my
hown
daughrter
come
james
be
a
cherishin
and
shake
he
puts
his
hand
sentimentally
on
morell
shoulder
morell
looking
up
at
him
thoughtfully
look
here
burgess
do
you
want
to
be
as
welcome
here
as
you
were
before
you
lost
that
contract
burgess
i
do
james
i
do
honest
morell
then
why
do
you
behave
as
you
did
then
burgess
cautiously
removing
his
hand
morell
i
tell
you
you
thought
me
a
young
fool
then
burgess
coaxingly
no
i
did
james
i
morell
cutting
him
short
yes
you
did
and
i
thought
you
an
old
scoundrel
burgess
most
vehemently
deprecating
this
gross
on
morell
part
no
you
did
james
now
you
do
yourself
a
hinjustice
morell
yes
i
did
well
that
did
not
prevent
our
getting
on
very
well
together
god
made
you
what
i
call
a
scoundrel
as
he
made
me
what
you
call
a
fool
the
effect
of
this
observation
on
burgess
is
to
remove
the
keystone
of
his
moral
arch
he
becomes
bodily
weak
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
morell
in
a
helpless
stare
puts
out
his
hand
apprehensively
to
balance
himself
as
if
the
floor
had
suddenly
sloped
under
him
morell
proceeds
in
the
same
tone
of
quiet
conviction
it
was
not
for
me
to
quarrel
with
his
handiwork
in
the
one
case
more
than
in
the
other
so
long
as
you
come
here
honestly
as
a
thorough
convinced
scoundrel
justifying
your
scoundrelism
and
proud
of
it
you
are
welcome
but
and
now
morell
tone
becomes
formidable
and
he
rises
and
strikes
the
back
of
the
chair
for
greater
emphasis
i
wo
have
you
here
snivelling
about
being
a
model
employer
and
a
converted
man
when
you
only
an
apostate
with
your
coat
turned
for
the
sake
of
a
county
council
contract
he
nods
at
him
to
enforce
the
point
then
goes
to
the
where
he
takes
up
a
comfortably
commanding
position
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
continues
no
i
like
a
man
to
be
true
to
himself
even
in
wickedness
come
now
either
take
your
hat
and
go
or
else
sit
down
and
give
me
a
good
scoundrelly
reason
for
wanting
to
be
friends
with
me
burgess
whose
emotions
have
subsided
sufficiently
to
be
expressed
by
a
dazed
grin
is
relieved
by
this
concrete
proposition
he
ponders
it
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
and
very
modestly
sits
down
in
the
chair
morell
has
just
left
right
now
out
with
it
burgess
chuckling
in
spite
of
himself
well
you
are
a
queer
bird
james
and
no
mistake
but
almost
enthusiastically
one
carnt
likin
you
besides
as
i
said
afore
of
course
one
do
take
all
a
clorgyman
says
seriously
or
the
world
could
go
on
could
it
now
he
composes
himself
for
graver
discourse
and
turning
his
eyes
on
morell
proceeds
with
dull
seriousness
well
i
do
mind
tellin
you
since
it
your
wish
we
should
be
free
with
one
another
that
i
did
think
you
a
bit
of
a
fool
once
but
i
beginnin
to
think
that
i
was
the
times
a
bit
morell
delighted
aha
you
finding
that
out
at
last
are
you
burgess
portentously
yes
times
changed
mor
i
could
a
believed
five
yorr
year
ago
no
sensible
man
would
a
thought
takin
up
with
your
ideas
i
hused
to
wonder
you
was
let
preach
at
all
why
i
know
a
clorgyman
that
bin
kep
hout
of
his
job
for
yorrs
by
the
bishop
of
london
although
the
pore
feller
not
a
bit
more
religious
than
you
are
but
if
henyone
was
to
offer
to
bet
me
a
thousan
poun
that
you
end
by
bein
a
bishop
yourself
i
venture
to
take
the
bet
you
and
yore
crew
are
gettin
hinfluential
i
can
see
that
they
to
give
you
something
someday
if
it
only
to
stop
yore
mouth
you
the
right
instinc
arter
all
james
the
line
you
took
is
the
payin
line
in
the
long
run
fur
a
man
o
your
sort
morell
decisively
offering
his
hand
shake
hands
burgess
now
you
talking
honestly
i
do
think
they
make
me
a
bishop
but
if
they
do
i
introduce
you
to
the
biggest
jobbers
i
can
get
to
come
to
my
dinner
parties
burgess
who
has
risen
with
a
sheepish
grin
and
accepted
the
hand
of
friendship
you
will
your
joke
james
our
quarrel
made
up
now
is
it
a
woman
voice
say
yes
james
startled
they
turn
quickly
and
find
that
candida
has
just
come
in
and
is
looking
at
them
with
an
amused
maternal
indulgence
which
is
her
characteristic
expression
she
is
a
woman
of
well
built
well
nourished
likely
one
guesses
to
become
matronly
later
on
but
now
quite
at
her
best
with
the
double
charm
of
youth
and
motherhood
her
ways
are
those
of
a
woman
who
has
found
that
she
can
always
manage
people
by
engaging
their
affection
and
who
does
so
frankly
and
instinctively
without
the
smallest
scruple
so
far
she
is
like
any
other
pretty
woman
who
is
just
clever
enough
to
make
the
most
of
her
sexual
attractions
for
trivially
selfish
ends
but
candida
serene
brow
courageous
eyes
and
well
set
mouth
and
chin
signify
largeness
of
mind
and
dignity
of
character
to
ennoble
her
cunning
in
the
affections
a
wisehearted
observer
looking
at
her
would
at
once
guess
that
whoever
had
placed
the
virgin
of
the
assumption
over
her
hearth
did
so
because
he
fancied
some
spiritual
resemblance
between
them
and
yet
would
not
suspect
either
her
husband
or
herself
of
any
such
idea
or
indeed
of
any
concern
with
the
art
of
titian
just
now
she
is
in
bonnet
and
mantle
laden
with
a
strapped
rug
with
her
umbrella
stuck
through
it
a
handbag
and
a
supply
of
illustrated
papers
morell
shocked
at
his
remissness
candida
why
looks
at
his
watch
and
is
horrified
to

the
train

time

engrossed
by
returning
to
her

forgot

penitent
emotion

a
little
shamefaced
and
doubtful
of
his
reception

compassionate
fervor

oh
eugene
one
of
james
discoveries
he
found
him
sleeping
on
the
embankment
last
june
have
you
noticed
our
new
picture
pointing
to
the
virgin
he
gave
us
that
burgess
incredulously
garn
mean
to
tell
me
your
hown
father
that
cab
touts
or
such
like
orf
the
embankment
buys
like
that
severely
do
deceive
me
candy
it
a
church
pictur
and
james
chose
it
hisself
candida
guess
again
eugene
is
a
cab
tout
burgess
then
wot
is
he
sarcastically
a
nobleman
i
candida
delighted
nodding
yes
his
uncle
a
peer
a
real
live
earl
burgess
not
daring
to
believe
such
good
news
no
candida
yes
he
had
a
seven
day
bill
for
pounds
in
his
pocket
when
james
found
him
on
the
embankment
he
thought
he
could
get
any
money
for
it
until
the
seven
days
were
up
and
he
was
too
shy
to
ask
for
credit
oh
he
a
dear
boy
we
are
very
fond
of
him
burgess
pretending
to
belittle
the
aristocracy
but
with
his
eyes
gleaming
hm
i
thort
you
would
git
a
piorr
peer
nevvy
visitin
in
victoria
park
unless
he
were
a
bit
of
a
flat
looking
again
at
the
picture
of
course
i
do
with
that
pictur
candy
but
still
it
a
class
fust
rate
work
of
art
i
can
see
that
be
sure
you
hintroduce
me
to
him
candy
he
looks
at
his
watch
anxiously
i
can
only
stay
about
two
minutes
morell
comes
back
with
eugene
whom
burgess
contemplates
with
enthusiasm
he
is
a
strange
shy
youth
of
eighteen
slight
effeminate
with
a
delicate
childish
voice
and
a
hunted
tormented
expression
and
shrinking
manner
that
show
the
painful
sensitiveness
that
very
swift
and
acute
apprehensiveness
produces
in
youth
before
the
character
has
grown
to
its
full
strength
yet
everything
that
his
timidity
and
frailty
suggests
is
contradicted
by
his
face
he
is
miserably
irresolute
does
not
know
where
to
stand
or
what
to
do
with
his
hands
and
feet
is
afraid
of
burgess
and
would
run
away
into
solitude
if
he
dared
but
the
very
intensity
with
which
he
feels
a
perfectly
commonplace
position
shows
great
nervous
force
and
his
nostrils
and
mouth
show
a
fiercely
petulant
wilfulness
as
to
the
quality
of
which
his
great
imaginative
eyes
and
fine
brow
are
reassuring
he
is
so
entirely
uncommon
as
to
be
almost
unearthly
and
to
prosaic
people
there
is
something
noxious
in
this
unearthliness
just
as
to
poetic
people
there
is
something
angelic
in
it
his
dress
is
anarchic
he
wears
an
old
blue
serge
jacket
unbuttoned
over
a
woollen
lawn
tennis
shirt
with
a
silk
handkerchief
for
a
cravat
trousers
matching
the
jacket
and
brown
canvas
shoes
in
these
garments
he
has
apparently
lain
in
the
heather
and
waded
through
the
waters
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
his
having
ever
brushed
them
as
he
catches
sight
of
a
stranger
on
entering
he
stops
and
edges
along
the
wall
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
morell
as
he
enters
come
along
you
can
spare
us
quarter
of
an
hour
at
all
events
this
is
my
burgess
marchbanks
marchbanks
nervously
backing
against
the
bookcase
glad
to
meet
you

burgess
crossing

with
great
heartiness
whilst
morell
joins
candida

to
splutter
with
laughter
candida
coming
to
the
rescue

train

if

do
go
at
once
come

in
the
afternoon

glee

bad

before
abashed
at
his
own
noisiness
morchbanks
i
know
yo
too
to
take
my
pleasantry
in
bad
part
he
again
offers
his
hand
marchbanks
taking
it
with
a
nervous
jerk
not
at
all
burgess
bye
bye
candy
i
look
in
again
later
on
so
long
james
morell
must
you
go
burgess
do
stir
he
goes
out
with
unabated
heartiness
morell
oh
i
see
you
out
he
follows
him
out
eugene
stares
after
them
apprehensively
holding
his
breath
until
burgess
disappears
candida
laughing
well
eugene
he
turns
with
a
start
and
comes
eagerly
towards
her
but
stops
irresolutely
as
he
meets
her
amused
look
what
do
you
think
of
my
father
marchbanks
i
i
hardly
know
him
yet
he
seems
to
be
a
very
nice
old
gentleman
candida
with
gentle
irony
and
you
go
to
the
freeman
founders
to
dine
with
him
wo
you
marchbanks
miserably
taking
it
quite
seriously
yes
if
it
will
please
you
candida
touched
do
you
know
you
are
a
very
nice
boy
eugene
with
all
your
queerness
if
you
had
laughed
at
my
father
i
should
have
minded
but
i
like
you
ever
so
much
better
for
being
nice
to
him
marchbanks
ought
i
to
have
laughed
i
noticed
that
he
said
something
funny
but
i
am
so
ill
at
ease
with
strangers
and
i
never
can
see
a
joke
i
very
sorry
he
sits
down
on
the
sofa
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
temples
between
his
fists
with
an
expression
of
hopeless
suffering
candida
bustling
him
goodnaturedly
oh
come
you
great
baby
you
you
are
worse
than
usual
this
morning
why
were
you
so
melancholy
as
we
came
along
in
the
cab
marchbanks
oh
that
was
nothing
i
was
wondering
how
much
i
ought
to
give
the
cabman
i
know
it
utterly
silly
but
you
do
know
how
dreadful
such
things
are
to
me
how
i
shrink
from
having
to
deal
with
strange
people
quickly
and
reassuringly
but
it
all
right
he
beamed
all
over
and
touched
his
hat
when
morell
gave
him
two
shillings
i
was
on
the
point
of
offering
him
ten
candida
laughs
heartily
morell
comes
back
with
a
few
letters
and
newspapers
which
have
come
by
the
midday
post
candida
oh
james
dear
he
was
going
to
give
the
cabman
ten
shillings
ten
shillings
for
a
three
minutes
drive
oh
dear
morell
at
the
table
glancing
through
the
letters
never
mind
her
marchbanks
the
overpaying
instinct
is
a
generous
one
better
than
the
underpaying
instinct
and
not
so
common
marchbanks
relapsing
into
dejection
no
cowardice
incompetence
morell
quite
right
candida
of
course
she
is
she
takes
up
her
handbag
and
now
i
must
leave
you
to
james
for
the
present
i
suppose
you
are
too
much
of
a
poet
to
know
the
state
a
woman
finds
her
house
in
when
she
been
away
for
three
weeks
give
me
my
rug
eugene
takes
the
strapped
rug
from
the
couch
and
gives
it
to
her
she
takes
it
in
her
left
hand
having
the
bag
in
her
right
now
hang
my
cloak
across
my
arm
he
obeys
now
my
hat
he
puts
it
into
the
hand
which
has
the
bag
now
open
the
door
for
me
he
hurries
up
before
her
and
opens
the
door
thanks
she
goes
out
and
marchbanks
shuts
the
door
morell
still
busy
at
the
table
you
stay
to
lunch
marchbanks
of
course
marchbanks
scared
i
must
he
glances
quickly
at
morell
but
at
once
avoids
his
frank
look
and
adds
with
obvious
disingenuousness
i
ca
morell
over
his
shoulder
you
mean
you
wo
marchbanks
earnestly
no
i
should
like
to
indeed
thank
you
very
much
but
but
morell
breezily
finishing
with
the
letters
and
coming
close
to
him
but
but
but
but
bosh
if
you
like
to
stay
stay
you
do
mean
to
persuade
me
you
have
anything
else
to
do
if
you
shy
go
and
take
a
turn
in
the
park
and
write
poetry
until
half
past
one
and
then
come
in
and
have
a
good
feed
marchbanks
thank
you
i
should
like
that
very
much
but
i
really
must
the
truth
is
morell
told
me
not
to
she
said
she
think
you
ask
me
to
stay
to
lunch
but
that
i
was
to
remember
if
you
did
that
you
did
really
want
me
to
plaintively
she
said
understand
but
i
do
please
do
tell
her
i
told
you
morell
drolly
oh
is
that
all
wo
my
suggestion
that
you
should
take
a
turn
in
the
park
meet
the
difficulty
marchbanks
how
morell
exploding
why
you
duffer
but
this
boisterousness
jars
himself
as
well
as
eugene
he
checks
himself
and
resumes
with
affectionate
seriousness
no
i
wo
put
it
in
that
way
my
dear
lad
in
a
happy
marriage
like
ours
there
is
something
very
sacred
in
the
return
of
the
wife
to
her
home
marchbanks
looks
quickly
at
him
half
anticipating
his
meaning
an
old
friend
or
a
truly
noble
and
sympathetic
soul
is
not
in
the
way
on
such
occasions
but
a
chance
visitor
is
the
hunted
expression
comes
out
with
sudden
vividness
in
eugene
face
as
he
understands
morell
occupied
with
his
own
thought
goes
on
without
noticing
it
candida
thought
i
would
rather
not
have
you
here
but
she
was
wrong
i
very
fond
of
you
my
boy
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
for
yourself
what
a
happy
thing
it
is
to
be
married
as
i
am
marchbanks
happy
your
marriage
you
think
that
you
believe
that
morell
buoyantly
i
know
it
my
lad
la
rochefoucauld
said
that
there
are
convenient
marriages
but
no
delightful
ones
you
do
know
the
comfort
of
seeing
through
and
through
a
thundering
liar
and
rotten
cynic
like
that
fellow
ha
ha
now
off
with
you
to
the
park
and
write
your
poem
half
past
one
sharp
mind
we
never
wait
for
anybody
marchbanks
wildly
no
stop
you
sha
i
force
it
into
the
light
morell
puzzled
eh
force
what
marchbanks
i
must
speak
to
you
there
is
something
that
must
be
settled
between
us
morell
with
a
whimsical
glance
at
the
clock
now
marchbanks
passionately
now
before
you
leave
this
room
he
retreats
a
few
steps
and
stands
as
if
to
bar
morell
way
to
the
door
morell
without
moving
and
gravely
perceiving
now
that
there
is
something
serious
the
matter
i
not
going
to
leave
it
my
dear
boy
i
thought
you
were
eugene
baffled
by
his
firm
tone
turns
his
back
on
him
writhing
with
anger
morell
goes
to
him
and
puts
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
strongly
and
kindly
disregarding
his
attempt
to
shake
it
off
come
sit
down
quietly
and
tell
me
what
it
is
and
remember
we
are
friends
and
need
not
fear
that
either
of
us
will
be
anything
but
patient
and
kind
to
the
other
whatever
we
may
have
to
say
marchbanks
twisting
himself
round
on
him
oh
i
am
not
forgetting
myself
i
am
only
covering
his
face
desperately
with
his
hands
full
of
horror
then
dropping
his
hands
and
thrusting
his
face
forward
fiercely
at
morell
he
goes
on
threateningly
you
shall
see
whether
this
is
a
time
for
patience
and
kindness
morell
firm
as
a
rock
looks
indulgently
at
him
do
look
at
me
in
that
way
you
think
yourself
stronger
than
i
am
but
i
shall
stagger
you
if
you
have
a
heart
in
your
breast
morell
powerfully
confident
stagger
me
my
boy
out
with
it
marchbanks
first
morell
first
marchbanks
i
love
your
wife
morell
recoils
and
after
staring
at
him
for
a
moment
in
utter
amazement
bursts
into
uncontrollable
laughter
eugene
is
taken
aback
but
not
disconcerted
and
he
soon
becomes
indignant
and
contemptuous
morell
sitting
down
to
have
his
laugh
out
why
my
dear
child
of
course
you
do
everybody
loves
her
they
ca
help
it
i
like
it
but
looking
up
whimsically
at
him
i
say
eugene
do
you
think
yours
is
a
case
to
be
talked
about
you
under
twenty
she
over
thirty
does
it
look
rather
too
like
a
case
of
calf
love
marchbanks
vehemently
you
dare
say
that
of
her
you
think
that
way
of
the
love
she
inspires
it
is
an
insult
to
her
morell
rising
quickly
in
an
altered
tone
to
her
eugene
take
care
i
have
been
patient
i
hope
to
remain
patient
but
there
are
some
things
i
wo
allow
do
force
me
to
show
you
the
indulgence
i
should
show
to
a
child
be
a
man
marchbanks
with
a
gesture
as
if
sweeping
something
behind
him
oh
let
us
put
aside
all
that
cant
it
horrifies
me
when
i
think
of
the
doses
of
it
she
has
had
to
endure
in
all
the
weary
years
during
which
you
have
selfishly
and
blindly
sacrificed
her
to
minister
to
your
you
turning
on
him
who
have
not
one
thought
one
sense
in
common
with
her
morell
philosophically
she
seems
to
bear
it
pretty
well
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
eugene
my
boy
you
are
making
a
fool
of
yourself
a
very
great
fool
of
yourself
there
a
piece
of
wholesome
plain
speaking
for
you
marchbanks
oh
do
you
think
i
do
know
all
that
do
you
think
that
the
things
people
make
fools
of
themselves
about
are
any
less
real
and
true
than
the
things
they
behave
sensibly
about
morell
gaze
wavers
for
the
first
time
he
instinctively
averts
his
face
and
stands
listening
startled
and
thoughtful
they
are
more
true
they
are
the
only
things
that
are
true
you
are
very
calm
and
sensible
and
moderate
with
me
because
you
can
see
that
i
am
a
fool
about
your
wife
just
as
no
doubt
that
old
man
who
was
here
just
now
is
very
wise
over
your
socialism
because
he
sees
that
you
are
a
fool
about
it
perplexity
deepens
markedly
eugene
follows
up
his
advantage
plying
him
fiercely
with
questions
does
that
prove

you
are
promise
of
higher
powers
than
i
can
ever
pretend
to
i
well
know
that
it
is
in
the
poet
that
the
holy
spirit
of
man
the
god
within
him
is
most
godlike
it
should
make
you
tremble
to
think
of
that
to
think
that
the
heavy
burthen
and
great
gift
of
a
poet
may
be
laid
upon
you
marchbanks
unimpressed
and
remorseless
his
boyish
crudity
of
assertion
telling
sharply
against
morell
oratory
it
does
not
make
me
tremble
it
is
the
want
of
it
in
others
that
makes
me
tremble
morell
redoubling
his
force
of
style
under
the
stimulus
of
his
genuine
feeling
and
eugene
obduracy
then
help
to
kindle
it
in
them
in
me
to
extinguish
it
in
the
future
when
you
are
as
happy
as
i
am
i
will
be
your
true
brother
in
the
faith
i
will
help
you
to
believe
that
god
has
given
us
a
world
that
nothing
but
our
own
folly
keeps
from
being
a
paradise
i
will
help
you
to
believe
that
every
stroke
of
your
work
is
sowing
happiness
for
the
great
harvest
that
all
even
the
humblest
shall
one
day
reap
and
last
but
trust
me
not
least
i
will
help
you
to
believe
that
your
wife
loves
you
and
is
happy
in
her
home
we
need
such
help
marchbanks
we
need
it
greatly
and
always
there
are
so
many
things
to
make
us
doubt
if
once
we
let
our
understanding
be
troubled
even
at
home
we
sit
as
if
in
camp
encompassed
by
a
hostile
army
of
doubts
will
you
play
the
traitor
and
let
them
in
on
me
marchbanks
looking
round
him
is
it
like
this
for
her
here
always
a
woman
with
a
great
soul
craving
for
reality
truth
freedom
and
being
fed
on
metaphors
sermons
stale
perorations
mere
rhetoric
do
you
think
a
woman
soul
can
live
on
your
talent
for
preaching
morell
stung
marchbanks
you
make
it
hard
for
me
to
control
myself
my
talent
is
like
yours
insofar
as
it
has
any
real
worth
at
all
it
is
the
gift
of
finding
words
for
divine
truth
marchbanks
impetuously
it
the
gift
of
the
gab
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
what
has
your
knack
of
fine
talking
to
do
with
the
truth
any
more
than
playing
the
organ
has
i
never
been
in
your
church
but
i
been
to
your
political
meetings
and
i
seen
you
do
called
rousing
the
meeting
to
enthusiasm
that
is
you
excited
them
until
they
behaved
exactly
as
if
they
were
drunk
and
their
wives
looked
on
and
saw
clearly
enough
what
fools
they
were
oh
it
an
old
story
you
find
it
in
the
bible
i
imagine
king
david
in
his
fits
of
enthusiasm
was
very
like
you
stabbing
him
with
the
words
but
his
wife
despised
him
in
her
heart
morell
wrathfully
leave
my
house
do
you
hear
he
advances
on
him
threateningly
marchbanks
shrinking
back
against
the
couch
let
me
alone
touch
me
morell
grasps
him
powerfully
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
he
cowers
down
on
the
sofa
and
screams
passionately
stop
morell
if
you
strike
me
i
kill
myself
i
wo
bear
it
almost
in
hysterics
let
me
go
take
your
hand
away
morell
with
slow
emphatic
scorn
you
little
snivelling
cowardly
whelp
releasing
him
go
before
you
frighten
yourself
into
a
fit
marchbanks
on
the
sofa
gasping
but
relieved
by
the
withdrawal
of
morell
hand
i
not
afraid
of
you
it
you
who
are
afraid
of
me
morell
quietly
as
he
stands
over
him
it
looks
like
it
does
it
marchbanks
with
petulant
vehemence
yes
it
does
morell
turns
away
contemptuously
eugene
scrambles
to
his
feet
and
follows
him
you
think
because
i
shrink
from
being
brutally
handled
because
with
tears
in
his
voice
i
can
do
nothing
but
cry
with
rage
when
i
am
met
with
violence
because
i
ca
lift
a
heavy
trunk
down
from
the
top
of
a
cab
like
you
because
i
ca
fight
you
for
your
wife
as
a
navvy
would
all
that
makes
you
think
that
i
afraid
of
you
but
you
wrong
if
i
have
got
what
you
call
british
pluck
i
have
british
cowardice
either
i
not
afraid
of
a
clergyman
ideas
i
fight
your
ideas
i
rescue
her
from
her
slavery
to
them
i
pit
my
own
ideas
against
them
you
are
driving
me
out
of
the
house
because
you
dare
let
her
choose
between
your
ideas
and
mine
you
are
afraid
to
let
me
see
her
again
morell
angered
turns
suddenly
on
him
he
flies
to
the
door
in
involuntary
dread
let
me
alone
i
say
i
going
morell
with
cold
scorn
wait
a
moment
i
am
not
going
to
touch
you
do
be
afraid
when
my
wife
comes
back
she
will
want
to
know
why
you
have
gone
and
when
she
finds
that
you
are
never
going
to
cross
our
threshold
again
she
will
want
to
have
that
explained
too
now
i
wish
to
distress
her
by
telling
her
that
you
have
behaved
like
a
blackguard
marchbanks
coming
back
with
renewed
vehemence
you
shall
you
must
if
you
give
any
explanation
but
the
true
one
you
are
a
liar
and
a
coward
tell
her
what
i
said
and
how
you
were
strong
and
manly
and
shook
me
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
and
how
i
shrank
and
was
terrified
and
how
you
called
me
a
snivelling
little
whelp
and
put
me
out
of
the
house
if
you
do
tell
her
i
will
i
write
to
her
morell
taken
aback
why
do
you
want
her
to
know
this
marchbanks
with
lyric
rapture
because
she
will
understand
me
and
know
that
i
understand
her
if
you
keep
back
one
word
of
it
from
her
if
you
are
not
ready
to
lay
the
truth
at
her
feet
as
i
am
then
you
will
know
to
the
end
of
your
days
that
she
really
belongs
to
me
and
not
to
you
going
morell
terribly
disquieted
stop
i
will
not
tell
her
marchbanks
turning
near
the
door
either
the
truth
or
a
lie
you
must
tell
her
if
i
go
morell
temporizing
marchbanks
it
is
sometimes
justifiable
marchbanks
cutting
him
short
i
know
to
lie
it
will
be
useless
clergyman
as
he
turns
finally
to
the
door
it
opens
and
candida
enters
in
housekeeping
attire
candida
are
you
going
eugene
looking
more
observantly
at
him
well
dear
me
just
look
at
you
going
out
into
the
street
in
that
state
you
are
a
poet
certainly
look
at
him
james
she
takes
him
by
the
coat
and
brings
him
forward
to
show
him
to
morell
look
at
his
collar
look
at
his
tie
look
at
his
hair
one
would
think
somebody
had
been
throttling
you
the
two
men
guard
themselves
against
betraying
their
consciousness
here
stand
still
she
buttons
his
collar
ties
his
neckerchief
in
a
bow
and
arranges
his
hair
there
now
you
look
so
nice
that
i
think
you
better
stay
to
lunch
after
all
though
i
told
you
you
must
it
will
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
she
puts
a
final
touch
to
the
bow
he
kisses
her
hand
do
be
silly
marchbanks
i
want
to
stay
of
course
unless
the
reverend
gentleman
your
husband
has
anything
to
advance
to
the
contrary
candida
shall
he
stay
james
if
he
promises
to
be
a
good
boy
and
to
help
me
to
lay
the
table
marchbanks
turns
his
head
and
looks
steadfastly
at
morell
over
his
shoulder
challenging
his
answer
morell
shortly
oh
yes
certainly
he
had
better
he
goes
to
the
table
and
pretends
to
busy
himself
with
his
papers
there
marchbanks
offering
his
arm
to
candida
come
and
lay
the
table
she
takes
it
and
they
go
to
the
door
together
as
they
go
out
he
adds
i
am
the
happiest
of
men
morell
so
was
i
an
hour
ago
act
ii
the
same
day
the
same
room
late
in
the
afternoon
the
spare
chair
for
visitors
has
been
replaced
at
the
table
which
is
if
possible
more
untidy
than
before
marchbanks
alone
and
idle
is
trying
to
find
out
how
the
typewriter
works
hearing
someone
at
the
door
he
steals
guiltily
away
to
the
window
and
pretends
to
be
absorbed
in
the
view
miss
garnett
carrying
the
notebook
in
which
she
takes
down
letters
in
shorthand
from
his
dictation
sits
down
at
the
typewriter
and
sets
to
work
transcribing
them
much
too
busy
to
notice
eugene
unfortunately
the
first
key
she
strikes
sticks
proserpine
bother
you
been
meddling
with
my
typewriter
marchbanks
and
there
not
the
least
use
in
your
trying
to
look
as
if
you
had
marchbanks
timidly
i
very
sorry
miss
garnett
i
only
tried
to
make
it
write
proserpine
well
you
made
this
key
stick
marchbanks
earnestly
i
assure
you
i
did
touch
the
keys
i
did
indeed
i
only
turned
a
little
wheel
he
points
irresolutely
at
the
tension
wheel
proserpine
oh
now
i
understand
she
sets
the
machine
to
rights
talking
volubly
all
the
time
i
suppose
you
thought
it
was
a
sort
of
nothing
to
do
but
turn
the
handle
and
it
would
write
a
beautiful
love
letter
for
you
straight
off
eh
marchbanks
seriously
i
suppose
a
machine
could
be
made
to
write
they
all
the
same
are
they
proserpine
somewhat
indignantly
any
such
discussion
except
by
way
of
pleasantry
being
outside
her
code
of
manners
how
do
i
know
why
do
you
ask
me
marchbanks
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
clever
people
people
who
can
do
business
and
write
letters
and
that
sort
of
thing
always
had
love
affairs
proserpine
rising
outraged
marchbanks
she
looks
severely
at
him
and
marches
with
much
dignity
to
the
bookcase
marchbanks
approaching
her
humbly
i
hope
i
have
offended
you
perhaps
i
should
have
alluded
to
your
love
affairs
proserpine
plucking
a
blue
book
from
the
shelf
and
turning
sharply
on
him
i
have
any
love
affairs
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
marchbanks
simply
really
oh
then
you
are
shy
like
me
is
that
so
proserpine
certainly
i
am
not
shy
what
do
you
mean
marchbanks
secretly
you
must
be
that
is
the
reason
there
are
so
few
love
affairs
in
the
world
we
all
go
about
longing
for
love
it
is
the
first
need
of
our
natures
the
loudest
cry
of
our
hearts
but
we
dare
not
utter
our
longing
we
are
too
shy
very
earnestly
oh
miss
garnett
what
would
you
not
give
to
be
without
fear
without
shame
proserpine
scandalized
well
upon
my
word
marchbanks
with
petulant
impatience
ah
do
say
those
stupid
things
to
me
they
do
deceive
me
what
use
are
they
why
are
you
afraid
to
be
your
real
self
with
me
i
am
just
like
you
proserpine
like
me
pray
are
you
flattering
me
or
flattering
yourself
i
do
feel
quite
sure
which
she
turns
to
go
back
to
the
typewriter
marchbanks
stopping
her
mysteriously
hush
i
go
about
in
search
of
love
and
i
find
it
in
unmeasured
stores
in
the
bosoms
of
others
but
when
i
try
to
ask
for
it
this
horrible
shyness
strangles
me
and
i
stand
dumb
or
worse
than
dumb
saying
meaningless
things
foolish
lies
and
i
see
the
affection
i
am
longing
for
given
to
dogs
and
cats
and
pet
birds
because
they
come
and
ask
for
it
almost
whispering
it
must
be
asked
for
it
is
like
a
ghost
it
can
not
speak
unless
it
is
first
spoken
to
at
his
normal
pitch
but
with
deep
melancholy
all
the
love
in
the
world
is
longing
to
speak
only
it
dare
not
because
it
is
shy
shy
shy
that
is
the
world
tragedy
with
a
deep
sigh
he
sits
in
the
spare
chair
and
buries
his
face
in
his
hands
proserpine
amazed
but
keeping
her
wits
about
her
her
point
of
honor
in
encounters
with
strange
young
men
wicked
people
get
over
that
shyness
occasionally
do
they
marchbanks
scrambling
up
almost
fiercely
wicked
people
means
people
who
have
no
love
therefore
they
have
no
shame
they
have
the
power
to
ask
love
because
they
do
need
it
they
have
the
power
to
offer
it
because
they
have
none
to
give
he
collapses
into
his
seat
and
adds
mournfully
but
we
who
have
love
and
long
to
mingle
it
with
the
love
of
others
we
can
not
utter
a
word
timidly
you
find
that
do
you
proserpine
look
here
if
you
do
stop
talking
like
this
i
leave
the
room
marchbanks
i
really
will
it
not
proper
she
resumes
her
seat
at
the
typewriter
opening
the
blue
book
and
preparing
to
copy
a
passage
from
it
marchbanks
hopelessly
nothing
that
worth
saying
is
proper
he
rises
and
wanders
about
the
room
in
his
lost
way
saying
i
understand
you
miss
garnett
what
am
i
to
talk
about
proserpine
snubbing
him
talk
about
indifferent
things
talk
about
the
weather
marchbanks
would
you
stand
and
talk
about
indifferent
things
if
a
child
were
by
crying
bitterly
with
hunger
proserpine
i
suppose
not
marchbanks
well
i
ca
talk
about
indifferent
things
with
my
heart
crying
out
bitterly
in
its
hunger
proserpine
then
hold
your
tongue
marchbanks
yes
that
is
what
it
always
comes
to
we
hold
our
tongues
does
that
stop
the
cry
of
your
heart
for
it
does
cry
does
it
it
must
if
you
have
a
heart
proserpine
suddenly
rising
with
her
hand
pressed
on
her
heart
oh
it
no
use
trying
to
work
while
you
talk
like
that
she
leaves
her
little
table
and
sits
on
the
sofa
her
feelings
are
evidently
strongly
worked
on
it
no
business
of
yours
whether
my
heart
cries
or
not
but
i
have
a
mind
to
tell
you
for
all
that
marchbanks
you
need
i
know
already
that
it
must
proserpine
but
mind
if
you
ever
say
i
said
so
i
deny
it
marchbanks
compassionately
yes
i
know
and
so
you
have
the
courage
to
tell
him
proserpine
bouncing
up
him
who
marchbanks
whoever
he
is
the
man
you
love
it
might
be
anybody
the
curate
mill
perhaps
proserpine
with
disdain
mr
mill
a
fine
man
to
break
my
heart
about
indeed
i
rather
have
you
than
mill
marchbanks
recoiling
no
really
i
very
sorry
but
you
think
of
that
i
proserpine
testily
crossing
to
the
fire
and
standing
at
it
with
her
back
to
him
oh
do
be
frightened
it
not
you
it
not
any
one
particular
person
marchbanks
i
know
you
feel
that
you
could
love
anybody
that
offered
proserpine
exasperated
anybody
that
offered
no
i
do
not
what
do
you
take
me
for
marchbanks
discouraged
no
use
you
wo
make
me
real
answers
only
those
things
that
everybody
says
he
strays
to
the
sofa
and
sits
down
disconsolately
proserpine
nettled
at
what
she
takes
to
be
a
disparagement
of
her
manners
by
an
aristocrat
oh
well
if
you
want
original
conversation
you
better
go
and
talk
to
yourself
marchbanks
that
is
what
all
poets
do
they
talk
to
themselves
out
loud
and
the
world
overhears
them
but
it
horribly
lonely
not
to
hear
someone
else
talk
sometimes
proserpine
wait
until
morell
comes

to
you
marchbanks
shudders

wry
faces
over
him

can
talk
better
than
you
with
temper
he
talk
your
little
head
off
she
is
going
back
angrily
to
her
place
when
suddenly
enlightened
he
springs
up
and
stops
her
marchbanks

now
proserpine
reddening
what
do

marchbanks

secret

woman
to

all
bounds

want
to
know

nothing
in
him
but

resolutions

people
call

that
proserpine
attempting
to
snub
him
by
an
air
of
cool
propriety
i
simply

about
i
do
understand
you
marchbanks
vehemently

for
a
woman

love
him
proserpine
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
yes
he
covers
his
face
with
his
hands
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
he
takes
down
his
hands
and
looks
at
her
frightened
at
the
tragic
mask
presented
to
her
she
hurries
past
him
at
the
utmost
possible
distance
keeping
her
eyes
on
his
face
until
he
turns
from
her
and
goes
to
the
child
chair
beside
the
hearth
where
he
sits
in
the
deepest
dejection
as
she
approaches
the
door
it
opens
and
burgess
enters
on
seeing
him
she
ejaculates
praise
heaven
here
somebody
and
sits
down
reassured
at
her
table
she
puts
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
into
the
typewriter
as
burgess
crosses
to
eugene
burgess
bent
on
taking
care
of
the
distinguished
visitor
well
so
this
is
the
way
they
leave
you
to
yourself
morchbanks
i
come
to
keep
you
company
marchbanks
looks
up
at
him
in
consternation
which
is
quite
lost
on
him
james
is
receivin
a
deppitation
in
the
dinin
room
and
candy
is
hupstairs
educatin
of
a
young
stitcher
gurl
she
hinterusted
in
she
settin
there
learnin

out
of
the
twins
condolingly
you
must
find
it
lonesome
here
with
no
one
but
the
typist
to
talk
to
he
pulls
round
the
easy
chair
above
fire
and
sits
down
proserpine
highly
incensed
he
be
all
right
now
that
he
has
the
advantage
of
your
polished
conversation
that
one
comfort
anyhow
she
begins
to
typewrite
with
clattering
asperity
burgess
amazed
at
her
audacity
hi
was
not
addressin
myself
to
you
young
woman
that
i
awerr
of
proserpine
tartly
to
marchbanks
did
you
ever
see
worse
manners
marchbanks
burgess
with
pompous
severity
morchbanks
is
a
gentleman
and
knows
his
place
which
is
more
than
some
people
do
proserpine
fretfully
it
well
you
and
i
are
not
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
talk
to
you
pretty
straight
if
marchbanks
here
she
pulls
the
letter
out
of
the
machine
so
crossly
that
it
tears
there
now
i
spoiled
this
letter
have
to
be
done
all
over
again
oh
i
ca
contain
myself
silly
old
fathead
burgess
rising
breathless
with
indignation
ho
i
a
silly
ole
fathead
am
i
ho
indeed
gasping
hall

my
gurl
hall
right
you
just
wait
till
i
tell
that
to
your
employer

i
teach
you

burgess
cutting
her
short
no

now
no
huse
to
me
i
let
you
know
who
i
am
proserpine
shifts
her
paper
carriage
with
a
defiant
bang
and
disdainfully
goes
on
with
her
work
do
you
take
no
notice
of
her
morchbanks
she
beneath
it
he
sits
down
again
loftily
marchbanks
miserably
nervous
and
disconcerted
had
we
better
change
the
subject
i
i
do
think
miss
garnett
meant
anything
proserpine
with
intense
conviction
oh
did
i
though
just
burgess
i
would
demean
myself
to
take
notice
on
her
an
electric
bell
rings
twice
proserpine
gathering
up
her
and
papers
that
for
me
she
hurries
out
burgess
calling
after
her
oh
we
can
spare
you
somewhat
relieved
by
the
triumph
of
having
the
last
word
and
yet
half
inclined
to
try
to
improve
on
it
he
looks
after
her
for
a
moment
then
subsides
into
his
seat
by
eugene
and
addresses
him
very
confidentially
now
alone
morchbanks
let
me
give
you
a
friendly
that
i
give
to
everybody
long
you
known
my
james
here
marchbanks
i
do
know
i
never
can
remember
dates
a
few
months
perhaps

queer
about
him

do
think

that
the
danger
in
it
well
he
mad
marchbanks
mad
burgess
mad
as
a
morch
you
take
notice
on
him
and
you
see
marchbanks
beginning
but
surely
that
is
only
because
his
opinions
burgess
touching
him
with
his
forefinger
on
his
knee
and
pressing
it
as
if
to
hold
his
attention
with
it
that
wot

when

to
hactin
on

go
on
he
looks
round
to
make
sure
that
they
are
alone
and
bends
over
to
eugene
ear
wot
do
you
think
he
says
to

this
mornin
in
this

drawers
burgess
oh

done
you
any
harm
that
the
question
for

dismisses
the
subject
by
going
to

table
and
setting
to
work
at
his
correspondence
burgess
aside
to
marchbanks

remonstrance
summat
pleasant
just

time
morell
takes
an
illustrated
paper
from
the
table
and
offers

he
accepts
it
humbly
thank

the
trouble
of

myself
in
the
morning
burgess
with
grave
disapproval
do

servant

james
morell
yes

she
is
a
slave
and
the
house
looks
as
if

to
lend
a
hand
it
not
a
bad
plan
prossy
and
i

after
breakfast
whilst
washing
up
washing
up
no
trouble
when
there
are
two
people
to
do
it
marchbanks
tormentedly
do
you
think
every
woman
is
as
as
miss
garnett
burgess
emphatically
that
quite
right
morchbanks
quite
right
she
is
morell
quietly
and
significantly
marchbanks
marchbanks
yes
morell
how
many
servants
does
your
father
keep
marchbanks
oh
i
do
know
he
comes
back
uneasily
to
the
sofa
as
if
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
morell
questioning
and
sits
down
in
great
agony
of
mind
thinking
of
the
paraffin
morell
very
gravely
so
many
that
you
do
know
more
aggressively
anyhow
when
there
anything
to
be
done
you
ring
the
bell
and
throw
it
on
to
somebody
else
eh
that
one
of
the
great
facts
in
your
existence
is
it
marchbanks
oh
do
torture
me
the
one
great
fact
now
is
that
your
wife
beautiful
fingers
are
dabbling
in
paraffin
oil
and
that
you
are
sitting
here
comfortably
preaching
about
it
everlasting
preaching
preaching
words
words
words
burgess
intensely
appreciating
this
retort
ha
ha
devil
a
better
radiantly
you
there
james
straight
candida
comes
in
well
aproned
with
a
reading
lamp
trimmed
filled
and
ready
for
lighting
she
places
it
on
the
table
near
morell
ready
for
use
candida
brushing
her
finger
tips
together
with
a
slight
twitch
of
her
nose
if

with
us
eugene
i
think
i
will
hand
over
the
lamps
to
you
marchbanks
i
will
stay
on
condition
that
you
hand
over
all
the
rough
work
to
me
candida
that
very
gallant
but
i
think
i
should
like
to
see
how

it
first
turning
to
morell
james
you

been
looking
after
the
house
properly
morell
what
have
i
done
or
not
done
my
love
candida
with
serious
vexation
my
own
particular
pet
scrubbing
brush
has
been
used
for
blackleading
a
wail
bursts
from
marchbanks
burgess
looks
round
amazed
candida
hurries
to
the
sofa
what
the
matter
are
you
ill
eugene
marchbanks
no
not
only
horror
horror
horror
he
bows
his
head
on
his
hands
burgess
shocked
what

the
morchbanks
oh
bad
at
your
age
you
must
leave
it
off
grajally
candida
reassured
nonsense
papa
it
only
poetic
horror
is
it
eugene
petting
him
burgess
abashed
oh
poetic
is
it
i
beg
your
pordon
shore
he
turns
to
the
fire
again
deprecating
his
hasty
conclusion
candida
what
is
it
eugene
the
scrubbing
brush
he
shudders
well
there
never
mind
she
sits
down
beside
him
would
you
like
to
present
me
with
a
nice
new
one
with
an
ivory
back
inlaid
with
marchbanks
softly
and
musically
but
sadly
and
longingly
no
not
a
scrubbing
brush
but
a
boat
a
tiny
shallop
to
sail
away
in
far
from
the
world
where
the
marble
floors
are
washed
by
the
rain
and
dried
by
the
sun
where
the
south
wind
dusts
the
beautiful
green
and
purple
carpets
or
a
chariot
to
carry
us
up
into
the
sky
where
the
lamps
are
stars
and
do
need
to
be
filled
with
paraffin
oil
every
day
morell
harshly
and
where
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
idle
selfish
and
useless
candida
jarred
oh
james
how
could
you
spoil
it
all
marchbanks
firing
up
yes
to
be
idle
selfish
and
useless
that
is
to
be
beautiful
and
free
and
happy
has
every
man
desired
that
with
all
his
soul
for
the
woman
he
loves
that
my
ideal
what
yours
and
that
of
all
the
dreadful
people
who

in
these
hideous
rows
of
houses
sermons
and
scrubbing
brushes

preach
the
sermon
and
your
wife
to
scrub
candida
quaintly

misgiving
over
his
new
and
alarming
experience

the
surer
he

of
his
moral

the
more
swiftly
and
effectively

burgess
not

an
attitude
of
the
haughtiest
disdain

of
asylum

to
take
care
of
him

goin
for
a
turn
in
the
garden
to
smoke
james
morell
brusquely
oh
all
right
all
right
burgess
goes
out
pathetically
in
the
character
of
the
weary
old
man
morell
stands
at
the
table
turning
over
his
papers
and
adding
across
to
proserpine
half
humorously
half
absently
well
miss
prossy
why
have
you
been
calling
my
names
proserpine
blushing
fiery
red
and
looking
quickly
up
at
him
half
scared
half
reproachful
i
she
bursts
into
tears
morell
with
tender
gaiety
leaning
across
the
table
towards
her
and
consoling
her
oh
come
come
come
never
mind
pross
he
is
a
silly
old
fathead
is
he
with
an
explosive
sob
she
makes
a
dash
at
the
door
and
vanishes
banging
it
morell
shaking
his
head
resignedly
sighs
and
goes
wearily
to
his
chair
where
he
sits
down
and
sets
to
work
looking
old
and
careworn
candida
comes
in
she
has
finished
her
household
work
and
taken
of
the
apron
she
at
once
notices
his
dejected
appearance
and
posts
herself
quietly
at
the
spare
chair
looking
down
at
him
attentively
but
she
says
nothing
morell
looking
up
but
with
his
pen
raised
ready
to
resume
his
work
well
where
is
eugene
candida
washing
his
hands
in
the
scullery
under
the
tap
he
will
make
an
excellent
cook
if
he
can
only
get
over
his
dread
of
maria
morell
shortly
ha
no
doubt
he
begins
writing
again
candida
going
nearer
and
putting
her
hand
down
softly
on
his
to
stop
him
as
she
says
come
here
dear
let
me
look
at
you
he
drops
his
pen
and
yields
himself
at
her
disposal
she
makes
him
rise
and
brings
him
a
little
away
from
the
table
looking
at
him
critically
all
the
time
turn
your
face
to
the
light
she
places
him
facing
the
window
my
boy
is
not
looking
well
has
he
been
overworking
morell
nothing
more
than
usual
candida
he
looks
very
pale
and
grey
and
wrinkled
and
old
his
melancholy
deepens
and
she
attacks
it
with
wilful
gaiety
here
pulling
him
towards
the
easy
chair
you
done
enough
writing
for
leave
prossy
to
finish
it
and
come
and
talk
to
me
morell
but
candida
yes
i
must
be
talked
to
sometimes
she
makes
him
sit
down
and
seats
herself
on
the
carpet
beside
his
knee
now
patting
his
hand
you
beginning
to
look
better
already
why
do
you
give
up
all
this
tiresome
overworking
going
out
every
night
lecturing
and
talking
of
course
what
you
say
is
all
very
true
and
very
right
but
it
does
no
good
they
do
mind
what
you
say
to
them
one
little
bit
of
course
they
agree
with
you
but
what
the
use
of
people
agreeing
with
you
if
they
go
and
do
just
the
opposite
of
what
you
tell
them
the
moment
your
back
is
turned
look
at
our
congregation
at
dominic
why
do
they
come
to
hear
you
talking
about
christianity
every
sunday
why
just
because
they
been
so
full
of
business
and
for
six
days
that
they
want
to
forget
all
about
it
and
have
a
rest
on
the
seventh
so
that
they
can
go
back
fresh
and
make
money
harder
than
ever
you
positively
help
them
at
it
instead
of
hindering
them
morell
with
energetic
seriousness
you
know
very
well
candida
that
i
often
blow
them
up
soundly
for
that
but
if
there
is
nothing
in
their
but
rest
and
diversion
why
do
they
try
something
more
amusing
more
there
must
be
some
good
in
the
fact
that
they
prefer
dominic
to
worse
places
on
sundays
candida
oh
the
worst
places
are
open
and
even
if
they
were
they
dare
be
seen
going
to
them
besides
james
dear
you
preach
so
splendidly
that
it
as
good
as
a
play
for
them
why
do
you
think
the
women
are
so
enthusiastic
morell
shocked
candida
candida
oh
know
you
silly
boy
you
think
it
your
socialism
and
your
religion
but
if
it
was
that
they
do
what
you
tell
them
instead
of
only
coming
to
look
at
you
they
all
have
prossy
complaint
morell
prossy
complaint
what
do
you
mean
candida
candida
yes
prossy
and
all
the
other
secretaries
you
ever
had
why
does
prossy
condescend
to
wash
up
the
things
and
to
peel
potatoes
and
abase
herself
in
all
manner
of
ways
for
six
shillings
a
week
less
than
she
used
to
get
in
a
city
office
she
in
love
with
you
james
the
reason
they
all
in
love
with
you
and
you
are
in
love
with
preaching
because
you
do
it
so
beautifully
and
you
think
it
all
enthusiasm
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
earth
and
so
do
they
you
dear
silly
morell
candida
what
dreadful
what
cynicism
are
you
jesting
or
can
it
be
are
you
jealous
candida
with
curious
thoughtfulness
yes
i
feel
a
little
jealous
sometimes
morell
incredulously
what
of
prossy
candida
laughing
no
no
no
no
not
jealous
of
anybody
jealous
for
somebody
else
who
is
not
loved
as
he
ought
to
be
morell
me
candida
you
why
you
spoiled
with
love
and
worship
you
get
far
more
than
is
good
for
you
no
i
mean
eugene
morell
startled
eugene
candida
it
seems
unfair
that
all
the
love
should
go
to
you
and
none
to
him
although
he
needs
it
so
much
more
than
you
do
a
convulsive
movement
shakes
him
in
spite
of
himself
what
the
matter
am
i
worrying
you
morell
hastily
not
at
all
looking
at
her
with
troubled
intensity
you
know
that
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
candida
candida
you
vain
thing
are
you
so
sure
of
your
irresistible
attractions
morell
candida
you
are
shocking
me
i
never
thought
of
my
attractions
i
thought
of
your
goodness
your
purity
that
is
what
i
confide
in
candida
what
a
nasty
uncomfortable
thing
to
say
to
me
oh
you
are
a
clergyman
james
a
thorough
clergyman
morell
turning
away
from
her
so
eugene
says
candida
with
lively
interest
leaning
over
to
him
with
her
arms
on
his
knee
eugene
always
right
he
a
wonderful
boy
i
have
grown
fonder
and
fonder
of
him
all
the
time
i
was
away
do
you
know
james
that
though
he
has
not
the
least
suspicion
of
it
himself
he
is
ready
to
fall
madly
in
love
with
me
morell
grimly
oh
he
has
no
suspicion
of
it
himself
has
he
candida
not
a
bit
she
takes
her
arms
from
his
knee
and
turns
thoughtfully
sinking
into
a
more
restful
attitude
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
some
day
he
will
know
when
he
is
grown
up
and
experienced
like
you
and
he
will
know
that
i
must
have
known
i
wonder
what
he
will
think
of
me
then
morell
no
evil
candida
i
hope
and
trust
no
evil
candida
dubiously
that
will
depend
morell
bewildered
depend
candida
looking
at
him
yes
it
will
depend
on
what
happens
to
him
he
look
vacantly
at
her
do
you
see
it
will
depend
on
how
he
comes
to
learn
what
love
really
is
i
mean
on
the
sort
of
woman
who
will
teach
it
to
him
morell
quite
at
a
loss
yes
no
i
do
know
what
you
mean
candida
explaining
if
he
learns
it
from
a
good
woman
then
it
will
be
all
right
he
will
forgive
me
morell
forgive
candida
but
suppose
he
learns
it
from
a
bad
woman
as
so
many
men
do
especially
poetic
men
who
imagine
all
women
are
angels
suppose
he
only
discovers
the
value
of
love
when
he
has
thrown
it
away
and
degraded
himself
in
his
ignorance
will
he
forgive
me
then
do
you
think
morell
forgive
you
for
what
candida
realizing
how
stupid
he
is
and
a
little
disappointed
though
quite
tenderly
so
do
you
understand
he
shakes
his
head
she
turns
to
him
again
so
as
to
explain
with
the
fondest
intimacy
i
mean
will
he
forgive
me
for
not
teaching
him
myself
for
abandoning
him
to
the
bad
women
for
the
sake
of
my
goodness
my
purity
as
you
call
it
ah
james
how
little
you
understand
me
to
talk
of
your
confidence
in
my
goodness
and
purity
i
would
give
them
both
to
poor
eugene
as
willingly
as
i
would
give
my
shawl
to
a
beggar
dying
of
cold
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
restrain
me
put
your
trust
in
my
love
for
you
james
for
if
that
went
i
should
care
very
little
for
your
sermons
mere
phrases
that
you
cheat
yourself
and
others
with
every
day
she
is
about
to
rise
morell
his
words
candida
checking
herself
quickly
in
the
act
of
getting
up
so
that
she
is
on
her
knees
but
upright
whose
words
morell
eugene
candida
delighted
he
is
always
right
he
understands
you
he
understands
me
he
understands
prossy
and
you
james
you
understand
nothing
she
laughs
and
kisses
him
to
console
him
he
recoils
as
if
stung
and
springs
up
morell
how
can
you
bear
to
do
that
when
oh
candida
with
anguish
in
his
voice
i
had
rather
you
had
plunged
a
grappling
iron
into
my
heart
than
given
me
that
kiss
candida
rising
alarmed
my
dear
what
the
matter
morell
frantically
waving
her
off
do
touch
me
candida
amazed
james
they
are
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
marchbanks
with
burgess
who
stops
near
the
door
staring
whilst
eugene
hurries
forward
between
them
marchbanks
is
anything
the
matter
morell
deadly
white
putting
an
iron
constraint
on
himself
nothing
but
this
that
either
you
were
right
this
morning
or
candida
is
mad
burgess
in
loudest
protest
wot
candy
mad
too
oh
come
come

he
crosses
the
room
to
the
fireplace
protesting
as
he
goes
and
knocks
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
on
the
bars
morell
sits
down
desperately
leaning
forward
to
hide
his
face
and
interlacing
his
fingers
rigidly
to
keep
them
steady
candida
to
morell
relieved
and
laughing
oh
you
only
shocked

that
all
how
conventional
all
you
unconventional
people
are
burgess
come
yourself
candy
what
morchbanks
think
of
you
candida
this
comes
of
james
teaching
me
to
think
for
myself
and
never
to
hold
back
out
of
fear
of
what
other
people
may
think
of
me
it
works
beautifully
as
long
as
i
think
the
same
things
as
he
does
but
now
because
i
have
just
thought
something
different
look
at
him
just

she
points
to
morell
greatly
amused
eugene
looks
and
instantly
presses
his
band
on
his
heart
as
if
some
deadly
pain
had
shot
through
it
and
sits
down
on
the
sofa
like
a
man
witnessing
a
tragedy
burgess
on
the
well

all
your
pardons
i
was
not
conscious
of
making
a
fuss
pulling
himself
together
well
well
well
well

he
goes
back
to
his
place
at
the
table
setting
to
work
at
his
papers
again
with
resolute
cheerfulness
candida
going
to
the
sofa
and
sitting
beside
marchbanks
still
in
a
bantering
humor
well
eugene
why

so
sad

the
onions

afraid
of

much
this
morning
well

how
much
afraid
i
am
by
leaving
him
here
in
your
custody
candida
marchbanks
to
himself
with
vivid
feeling
that
brave
beautiful
he
sits
down
again
listening
with
parted
lips
candida
with
anxious
misgiving
but
but
is
anything
the
matter
james
greatly
troubled
i
ca
understand
morell
ah
i
thought
it
was
i
who
could
understand
dear
he
takes
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
kisses
her
on
the
forehead
then
looks
round
quietly
at
marchbanks
act
iii
late
in
the
evening
past
ten
the
curtains
are
drawn
and
the
lamps
lighted
the
typewriter
is
in
its
case
the
large
table
has
been
cleared
and
tidied
everything
indicates
that
the
day
work
is
done
candida
and
marchbanks
are
seated
at
the
fire
the
reading
lamp
is
on
the
mantelshelf
above
marchbanks
who
is
sitting
on
the
small
chair
reading
aloud
from
a
manuscript
a
little
pile
of
manuscripts
and
a
couple
of
volumes
of
poetry
are
on
the
carpet
beside
him
candida
is
in
the
easy
chair
with
the
poker
a
light
brass
one
upright
in
her
hand
she
is
leaning
back
and
looking
at
the
point
of
it
curiously
with
her
feet
stretched
towards
the
blaze
and
her
heels
resting
on
the
fender
profoundly
unconscious
of
her
appearance
and
surroundings
marchbanks
breaking
off
in
his
recitation
every
poet
that
ever
lived
has
put
that
thought
into
a
sonnet
he
must
he
ca
help
it
he
looks
to
her
for
assent
and
notices
her
absorption
in
the
poker
have
you
been
listening
no
response
morell
candida
starting
eh
marchbanks
have
you
been
listening
candida
with
a
guilty
excess
of
politeness
oh
yes
it
very
nice
go
on
eugene
i
longing
to
hear
what
happens
to
the
angel
marchbanks
crushed
the
manuscript
dropping
from
his
hand
to
the
floor
i
beg
your
pardon
for
boring
you
candida
but
you
are
not
boring
me
i
assure
you
please
go
on
do
eugene
marchbanks
i
finished
the
poem
about
the
angel
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
i
read
you
several
things
since
candida
remorsefully
i
so
sorry
eugene
i
think
the
poker
must
have
fascinated
me
she
puts
it
down
marchbanks
it
made
me
horribly
uneasy
candida
why
did
you
tell
me
i
have
put
it
down
at
once
marchbanks
i
was
afraid
of
making
you
uneasy
too
it
looked
as
if
it
were
a
weapon
if
i
were
a
hero
of
old
i
should
have
laid
my
drawn
sword
between
us
if
morell
had
come
in
he
would
have
thought
you
had
taken
up
the
poker
because
there
was
no
sword
between
us
candida
wondering
what
with
a
puzzled
glance
at
him
i
quite
follow
that
those
sonnets
of
yours
have
perfectly
addled
me
why
should
there
be
a
sword
between
us
marchbanks
evasively
oh
never
mind
he
stoops
to
pick
up
the
manuscript
candida
put
that
down
again
eugene
there
are
limits
to
my
appetite
for
poetry
even
your
poetry
you
been
reading
to
me
for
more
than
two
hours
ever
since
james
went
out
i
want
to
talk
marchbanks
rising
scared
no
i
must
talk
he
looks
round
him
in
his
lost
way
and
adds
suddenly
i
think
i
go
out
and
take
a
walk
in
the
park
making
for
the
door
candida
nonsense
it
shut
long
ago
come
and
sit
down
on
the
and
talk
moonshine
as
you
usually
do
i
want
to
be
amused
do
you
want
to
marchbanks
in
half
terror
half
rapture
yes
candida
then
come
along
she
moves
her
chair
back
a
little
to
make
room
he
hesitates
then
timidly
stretches
himself
on
the
face
upwards
and
throws
back
his
head
across
her
knees
looking
up
at
her
marchbanks
oh
i
been
so
miserable
all
the
evening
because
i
was
doing
right
now
i
doing
wrong
and
i
happy
candida
tenderly
amused
at
him
yes
i
sure
you
feel
a
great
grown
up
wicked
deceiver
quite
proud
of
yourself
are
you
marchbanks
raising
his
head
quickly
and
turning
a
little
to
look
round
at
her
take
care
i
ever
so
much
older
than
you
if
you
only
knew
he
turns
quite
over
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
clasped
and
his
arms
on
her
lap
and
speaks
with
growing
impulse
his
blood
beginning
to
stir
may
i
say
some
wicked
things
to
you
candida
without
the
least
fear
or
coldness
quite
nobly
and
with
perfect
respect
for
his
passion
but
with
a
touch
of
her
maternal
humor
no
but
you
may
say
anything
you
really
and
truly
feel
anything
at
all
no
matter
what
it
is
i
am
not
afraid
so
long
as
it
is
your
real
self
that
speaks
and
not
a
mere
attitude
a
gallant
attitude
or
a
wicked
attitude
or
even
a
poetic
attitude
i
put
you
on
your
honor
and
truth
now
say
whatever
you
want
to
marchbanks
the
eager
expression
vanishing
utterly
from
his
lips
and
nostrils
as
his
eyes
light
up
with
pathetic
spirituality
oh
now
i
ca
say
anything
all
the
words
i
know
belong
to
some
attitude
or
other
all
except
one
candida
what
one
is
that
marchbanks
softly
losing
himself
in
the
music
of
the
name
candida
candida
candida
candida
candida
i
must
say
that
now
because
you
have
put
me
on
my
honor
and
truth
and
i
never
think
or
feel
morell
it
is
always
candida
candida
of
course
and
what
have
you
to
say
to
candida
marchbanks
nothing
but
to
repeat
your
name
a
thousand
times
you
feel
that
every
time
is
a
prayer
to
you
candida
does
it
make
you
happy
to
be
able
to
pray
marchbanks
yes
very
happy
candida
well
that
happiness
is
the
answer
to
your
prayer
do
you
want
anything
more
marchbanks
in
beatitude
no
i
have
come
into
heaven
where
want
is
unknown
morell
comes
in
he
halts
on
the
threshold
and
takes
in
the
scene
at
a
glance
morell
grave
and
i
hope
i
do
disturb
you
candida
starts
up
violently
but
without
the
smallest
embarrassment
laughing
at
herself
eugene
still
kneeling
saves
himself
from
falling
by
putting
his
hands
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
remains
there
staring
open
mouthed
at
morell
candida
as
she
rises
oh
james
how
you
startled
me
i
was
so
taken
up
with
eugene
that
i
did
hear
your
how
did
the
meeting
go
off
did
you
speak
well
morell
i
have
never
spoken
better
in
my
life
candida
that
was
first
rate
how
much
was
the
collection
morell
i
forgot
to
ask
candida
to
eugene
he
must
have
spoken
splendidly
or
he
would
never
have
forgotten
that
to
morell
where
are
all
the
others
morell
they
left
long
before
i
could
get
away
i
thought
i
should
never
escape
i
believe
they
are
having
supper
somewhere
candida
in
her
domestic
business
tone
oh
in
that
case
maria
may
go
to
bed
i
tell
her
she
goes
out
to
the
kitchen
morell
looking
sternly
down
at
marchbanks
well
marchbanks
squatting
on
the
and
actually
at
ease
with
morell
even
impishly
humorous
well
morell
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
marchbanks
only
that
i
have
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
here
in
private
whilst
you
have
been
making
a
fool
of
yourself
in
public
morell
hardly
in
the
same
way
i
think
marchbanks
scrambling
up
eagerly
the
very
very
very
same
way
i
have
been
playing
the
good
man
just
like
you
when
you
began
your
heroics
about
leaving
me
here
with
candida
morell
involuntarily
candida
marchbanks
oh
yes
i
got
that
far
heroics
are
infectious
i
caught
the
disease
from
you
i
swore
not
to
say
a
word
in
your
absence
that
i
would
not
have
said
a
month
ago
in
your
presence
morell
did
you
keep
your
oath
marchbanks
suddenly
perching
himself
grotesquely
on
the
easy
chair
i
was
ass
enough
to
keep
it
until
about
ten
minutes
ago
up
to
that
moment
i
went
on
desperately
reading
to
her
reading
my
own
poems
anybody
poems
to
stave
off
a
conversation
i
was
standing
outside
the
gate
of
heaven
and
refusing
to
go
in
oh
you
ca
think
how
heroic
it
was
and
how
uncomfortable
then
morell
steadily
controlling
his
suspense
then
marchbanks
prosaically
slipping
down
into
a
quite
ordinary
attitude
in
the
chair
then
she
could
bear
being
read
to
any
longer
morell
and
you
approached
the
gate
of
heaven
at
last
marchbanks
yes
morell
well
fiercely
speak
man
have
you
no
feeling
for
me
marchbanks
softly
and
musically
then
she
became
an
angel
and
there
was
a
flaming
sword
that
turned
every
way
so
that
i
could
go
in
for
i
saw
that
that
gate
was
really
the
gate
of
hell
morell
triumphantly
she
repulsed
you
marchbanks
rising
in
wild
scorn
no
you
fool
if
she
had
done
that
i
should
never
have
seen
that
i
was
in
heaven
already
repulsed
me
you
think
that
would
have
saved
me
virtuous
indignation
oh
you
are
not
worthy
to
live
in
the
same
world
with
her
he
turns
away
contemptuously
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
morell
who
has
watched
him
quietly
without
changing
his
place
do
you
think
you
make
yourself
more
worthy
by
reviling
me
eugene
marchbanks
here
endeth
the
thousand
and
first
lesson
morell
i
think
much
of
your
preaching
after
all
i
believe
i
could
do
it
better
myself
the
man
i
want
to
meet
is
the
man
that
candida
married
morell
the
man
that
do
you
mean
me
marchbanks
i
do
mean
the
reverend
james
mavor
morell
moralist
and
windbag
i
mean
the
real
man
that
the
reverend
james
must
have
hidden
somewhere
inside
his
black
coat
the
man
that
candida
loved
you
make
a
woman
like
candida
love
you
by
merely
buttoning
your
collar
at
the
back
instead
of
in
front
morell
boldly
and
steadily
when
candida
promised
to
marry
me
i
was
the
same
moralist
and
windbag
that
you
now
see
i
wore
my
black
coat
and
my
collar
was
buttoned
behind
instead
of
in
front
do
you
think
she
would
have
loved
me
any
the
better
for
being
insincere
in
my
profession
marchbanks
on
the
sofa
hugging
his
ankles
oh
she
forgave
you
just
as
she
forgives
me
for
being
a
coward
and
a
weakling
and
what
you
call
a
snivelling
little
whelp
and
all
the
rest
of
it
dreamily
a
woman
like
that
has
divine
insight
she
loves
our
souls
and
not
our
follies
and
vanities
and
illusions
or
our
collars
and
coats
or
any
other
of
the
rags
and
tatters
we
are
rolled
up
in
he
reflects
on
this
for
an
instant
then
turns
intently
to
question
morell
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
you
got
past
the
flaming
sword
that
stopped
me
morell
meaningly
perhaps
because
i
was
not
interrupted
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
marchbanks
taken
aback
what
morell
man
can
climb
to
the
highest
summits
but
he
can
not
dwell
there
long
marchbanks
it
false
there
can
he
dwell
for
ever
and
there
only
it
in
the
other
moments
that
he
can
find
no
rest
no
sense
of
the
silent
glory
of
life
where
would
you
have
me
spend
my
moments
if
not
on
the
summits
morell
in
the
scullery
slicing
onions
and
filling
lamps
marchbanks
or
in
the
pulpit
scrubbing
cheap
earthenware
souls
morell
yes
that
too
it
was
there
that
i
earned
my
golden
moment
and
the
right
in
that
moment
to
ask
her
to
love
me
i
did
not
take
the
moment
on
credit
nor
did
i
use
it
to
steal
another
man
happiness
marchbanks
rather
disgustedly
trotting
back
towards
the
fireplace
i
have
no
doubt
you
conducted
the
transaction
as
honestly
as
if
you
were
buying
a
pound
of
cheese
he
stops
on
the
brink
of
the
and
adds
thoughtfully
to
himself
with
his
back
turned
to
morell
i
could
only
go
to
her
as
a
beggar
morell
starting
a
beggar
dying
of
cold
asking
for
her
shawl
marchbanks
turning
surprised
thank
you
for
touching
up
my
poetry
yes
if
you
like
a
beggar
dying
of
cold
asking
for
her
shawl
morell
excitedly
and
she
refused
shall
i
tell
you
why
she
refused
i
can
tell
you
on
her
own
authority
it
was
because
of
marchbanks
she
did
refuse
morell
not
marchbanks
she
offered
me
all
i
chose
to
ask
for
her
shawl
her
wings
the
wreath
of
stars
on
her
head
the
lilies
in
her
hand
the
crescent
moon
beneath
her
feet
morell
seizing
him
out
with
the
truth
man
my
wife
is
my
wife
i
want
no
more
of
your
poetic
fripperies
i
know
well
that
if
i
have
lost
her
love
and
you
have
gained
it
no
law
will
bind
her
marchbanks
quaintly
without
fear
or
resistance
catch
me
by
the
shirt
collar
morell
she
will
arrange
it
for
me
afterwards
as
she
did
this
morning
with
quiet
rapture
i
shall
feel
her
hands
touch
me
morell
you
young
imp
do
you
know
how
dangerous
it
is
to
say
that
to
me
or
with
a
sudden
misgiving
has
something
made
you
brave
marchbanks
i
not
afraid
now
i
disliked
you
before
that
was
why
i
shrank
from
your
touch
but
i
saw
when
she
tortured
you
that
you
love
her
since
then
i
have
been
your
friend
you
may
strangle
me
if
you
like
morell
releasing
him
eugene
if
that
is
not
a
heartless
lie
if
you
have
a
spark
of
human
feeling
left
in
you
will
you
tell
me
what
has
happened
during
my
absence
marchbanks
what
happened
why
the
flaming
sword
morell
stamps
with
impatience
well
in
plain
prose
i
loved
her
so
exquisitely
that
i
wanted
nothing
more
than
the
happiness
of
being
in
such
love
and
before
i
had
time
to
come
down
from
the
highest
summits
you
came
in
morell
suffering
deeply
so
it
is
still
unsettled
still
the
misery
of
doubt
marchbanks
misery
i
am
the
happiest
of
men
i
desire
nothing
now
but
her
happiness
with
dreamy
enthusiasm
oh
morell
let
us
both
give
her
up
why
should
she
have
to
choose
between
a
wretched
little
nervous
disease
like
me
and
a
parson
like
you
let
us
go
on
a
pilgrimage
you
to
the
east
and
i
to
the
west

with
his
elbows
on

knees
and
his
head
propped
on
his
clenched
fists
marchbanks
snapping
his
fingers
wildly

silly
questions

petrified
candida
amazed
on
the
threshold
what
on
earth
are
you
at
eugene
marchbanks
oddly
james
and
i
are
having
a
preaching
match
and
he
is
getting
the
worst
of
it
candida
looks
quickly
round
at
morell
seeing
that
he
is
distressed
she
hurries
down
to
him
greatly
vexed
speaking
with
vigorous
reproach
to
marchbanks
candida
you
have
been
annoying
him
now
i
wo
have
it
eugene
do

wifely
tact

her
annoyance

be
worried

will
protect
him
morell
rising
proudly

candida

heeding
him
to
eugene

candida
eugene

marchbanks
piteously
i
mean
i
i
very
sorry

wo
do
it
again
indeed
i
wo
i
let
him
alone
morell
indignantly
with
an
aggressive
movement
towards
eugene
let
me
alone
you
young
candida
stopping
him
sh
no
let
me
deal
with
him
james
marchbanks
oh
you
not
angry
with
me
are
you
candida
severely
yes
i
am
very
angry
i
have
a
great
mind
to
pack
you
out
of
the
house
morell
taken
aback
by
candida
vigor
and
by
no
means
relishing
the
sense
of
being
rescued
by
her
from
another
man
gently
candida
gently
i
am
able
to
take
care
of
myself
candida
petting
him
yes
dear
of
course
you
are
but
you
must
be
annoyed
and
made
miserable
marchbanks
almost
in
tears
turning
to
the
door
i
go
candida
oh
you
need
go
i
ca
turn
you
out
at
this
time
of
night
vehemently
shame
on
you
for
shame
marchbanks
desperately
but
what
have
i
done
candida
i
know
what
you
have
done
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
here
all
the
time
oh
it
was
unworthy
you
are
like
a
child
you
can
not
hold
your
tongue
marchbanks
i
would
die
ten
times
over
sooner
than
give
you
a
pain
candida
with
infinite
contempt
for
this
puerility
much
good
your
dying
would
do
me
morell
candida
my
dear
this
altercation
is
hardly
quite
seemingly
it
is
a
matter
between
two
men
and
i
am
the
right
person
to
settle
it
candida
two
men
do
you
call
that
a
man
to
eugene
you
bad
boy
marchbanks
gathering
a
whimsically
affectionate
courage
from
the
scolding
if
i
am
to
be
scolded
like
this
i
must
make
a
boy
excuse
he
began
it
and
he
bigger
than
i
am
candida
losing
confidence
a
little
as
her
concern
for
morell
dignity
takes
the
alarm
that
ca
be
true
to
morell
you
did
begin
it
james
did
you
morell
contemptuously
no
marchbanks
indignant
oh
morell
to
eugene
you
began
it
this
morning
candida
instantly
connecting
this
with
his
mysterious
allusion
in
the
afternoon
to
something
told
him
by
eugene
in
the
morning
looks
quickly
at
him
wrestling
with
the
enigma
morell
proceeds
with
the
emphasis
of
offended
superiority
but
your
other
point
is
true
i
am
certainly
the
bigger
of
the
two
and
i
hope
the
stronger
candida
so
you
had
better
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
candida
again
soothing
him
yes
dear
but
troubled
i
understand
about
this
morning
morell
gently
snubbing
her
you
need
not
understand
my
dear
candida
but
james
i
the
street
bell
rings
oh
bother
here
they
all
come
she
goes
out
to
let
them
in
marchbanks
running
to
morell
oh
morell
is
it
dreadful
angry
with
us
she
hates
me
what
shall
i
do
morell
with
quaint
desperation
clutching
himself
by
the
hair
eugene
my
head
is
spinning
round
i
shall
begin
to
laugh
presently
he
walks
up
and
down
the
middle
of
the
room
marchbanks
following
him
anxiously
no
no
she
think
i
thrown
you
into
hysterics

boisterous
voices
and
laughter
are
heard
approaching
lexy
mill
his
eyes
sparkling
and
his
bearing
denoting
unwonted
elevation
of
spirit
enters
with
burgess
who
is
greasy
and
but
has
all
his
wits
about
him
miss
garnett
with
her
smartest
hat
and
jacket
on
follows
them
but
though
her
eyes
are
brighter
than
before
she
is
evidently
a
prey
to
misgiving
she
places
herself
with
her
back
to
her
typewriting
table
with
one
hand
on
it
to
rest
herself
passes
the
other
across
her
forehead
as
if
she
were
a
little
tired
and
giddy
marchbanks
relapses
into
shyness
and
edges
away
into
the
corner
near
the
window
where
morell
books
are
mill
exhilaratedly
morell
i

too
fast

by
throwing
her
angrily
beside

covering
a
lively
satisfaction

diplomatic
cunning

a
deprecatory
cough

a
terrible
scene

afraid
morell
not
in

courage
before
he
rises
timidly
and
puts
his
hand
appealingly
on
morell
forearm
stand
by
me
you
morell
casting
him
off
gently
but
resolutely
each
for
himself
eugene
she
must
choose
between
us
now
he
goes
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
candida
returns
eugene
sits
down
again
on
the
sofa
like
a
guilty
schoolboy
on
his
best
behaviour
candida
between
them
addressing
eugene
are
you
sorry
marchbanks
earnestly
yes
heartbroken
candida
well
then
you
are
forgiven
now
go
off
to
bed
like
a
good
little
boy
i
want
to
talk
to
james
about

rising
in
great
consternation
oh

ca
do
that
morell
i
must
be
here
i
not
go
away
tell
her
candida
with
quick
suspicion
tell
me
what
his
eyes
avoid
hers
furtively
she
turns
and
mutely
transfers
the
question
to
morell
morell
bracing
himself
for
the
catastrophe
i
have
nothing
to
tell
her
except
here
his
voice
deepens
to
a
measured
and
mournful
tenderness
that
she
is
my
greatest
treasure
on
earth
if
she
is
really
mine
candida
coldly
offended
by
his
yielding
to
his
orator
instinct
and
treating
her
as
if
she
were
the
audience
at
the
guild
of
matthew
i
am
sure
eugene
can
say
no
less
if
that
is
all
marchbanks
discouraged
morell
she
laughing
at
us
morell
with
a
quick
touch
of
temper
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
are
you
laughing
at
us
candida
candida
with
quiet
anger
eugene
is
very
james
i
hope
i
am
going
to
laugh
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
very
angry
she
goes
to
the
fireplace
and
stands
there
leaning
with
her
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
and
her
foot
on
the
fender
whilst
eugene
steals
to
morell
and
plucks
him
by
the
sleeve
marchbanks
whispering
stop
morell
do
let
us
say
anything
morell
pushing
eugene
away
without
deigning
to
look
at
him
i
hope
you
do
mean
that
as
a
threat
candida
candida
with
emphatic
warning
take
care
james
eugene
i
asked
you
to
go
are
you
going
morell
putting
his
foot
down
he
shall
not
go
i
wish
him
to
remain
marchbanks
i
go
i
do
whatever
you
want
he
turns
to
the
door
candida
stop
he
obeys
did
you
hear
james
say
he
wished
you
to
stay
james
is
master
here
do
you
know
that
marchbanks
flushing
with
a
young
poet
rage
against
tyranny
by
what
right
is
he
master
candida
quietly
tell
him
james
morell
taken
aback
my
dear
i
do
know
of
any
right
that
makes
me
master
i
assert
no
such
right
candida
with
infinite
reproach
you
do
know
oh
james
james
to
eugene
musingly
i
wonder
do
you
understand
eugene
no
you
too
young
well
i
give
you
leave
to
stay
to
stay
and
learn
she
comes
away
from
the
hearth
and
places
herself
between
them
now
james
what
the
matter
come
tell
me
marchbanks
whispering
tremulously
across
to
him
do
candida
come
out
with
it
morell
slowly
i
meant
to
prepare
your
mind
carefully
candida
so
as
to
prevent
misunderstanding
candida
yes
dear
i
am
sure
you
did
but
never
mind
i
misunderstand
morell
well
er
he
hesitates
unable
to
find
the
long
explanation
which
he
supposed
to
be
available
candida
well
morell
baldly
eugene
declares
that
you
are
in
love
with
him
marchbanks
frantically
no
no
no
no
never
i
did
not
morell
it
not
true
i
said
i
loved
you
and
that
he
did
i
said
that
i
understood
you
and
that
he
could
and
it
was
not
after
what
passed
there
before
the
fire
that
i
spoke
it
was
not
on
my
word
it
was
this
morning
candida
enlightened
this
morning
marchbanks
yes
he
looks
at
her
pleading
for
credence
and
then
adds
simply
that
was
what
was
the
matter
with
my
collar
candida
after
a
pause
for
she
does
not
take
in
his
meaning
at
once
his
collar
she
turns
to
morell
shocked
oh
james
did
you
she
stops
morell
ashamed
you
know
candida
that
i
have
a
temper
to
struggle
with
and
he
said
shuddering
that
you
despised
me
in
your
heart
candida
turning
quickly
on
eugene
did
you
say
that
marchbanks
terrified
no
candida
severely
then
james
has
just
told
me
a
falsehood
is
that
what
you
mean
marchbanks
no
no
i
i
blurting
out
the
explanation
desperately
it
was
david
wife
and
it
was
at
home
it
was
when
she
saw
him
dancing
before
all
the
people
morell
taking
the
cue
with
a
debater
adroitness
dancing
before
all
the
people
candida
and
thinking
he
was
moving
their
hearts
by
his
mission
when
they
were
only
suffering
from
prossy
complaint
she
is
about
to
protest
he
raises
his
hand
to
silence
her
exclaiming
try
to
look
indignant
candida
candida
interjecting
try
morell
continuing
eugene
was
right
as
you
told
me
a
few
hours
after
he
is
always
right
he
said
nothing
that
you
did
not
say
far
better
yourself
he
is
the
poet
who
sees
everything
and
i
am
the
poor
parson
who
understands
nothing
candida
remorsefully
do
you
mind
what
is
said
by
a
foolish
boy
because
i
said
something
like
it
again
in
jest
morell
that
foolish
boy
can
speak
with
the
inspiration
of
a
child
and
the
cunning
of
a
serpent
he
has
claimed
that
you
belong
to
him
and
not
to
me
and
rightly
or
wrongly
i
have
come
to
fear
that
it
may
be
true
i
will
not
go
about
tortured
with
doubts
and
suspicions
i
will
not
live
with
you
and
keep
a
secret
from
you
i
will
not
suffer
the
intolerable
degradation
of
jealousy
we
have
agreed
he
and
i
that
you
shall
choose
between
us
now
i
await
your
decision
candida
slowly
recoiling
a
step
her
heart
hardened
by
his
rhetoric
in
spite
of
the
sincere
feeling
behind
it
oh
i
am
to
choose
am
i
i
suppose
it
is
quite
settled
that
i
must
belong
to
one
or
the
other
morell

down

eyes
and
throat
fill
with
tears
the
orator
becomes
the
wounded
animal
i
ca
speak
candida
impulsively
going
to
him

wild
alarm

show
her
that
you

morell

rack

morell
rallying
all
his
forces

from
candida
candida

i

your
pardon

i
am
waiting
to
hear
your
bid
morell
with
proud
humility
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
my
strength
for
your
defence
my
honesty
of
purpose
for
your
surety
my
ability
and
industry
for
your
livelihood
and
my
authority
and
position
for

all
it
becomes
a
man
to
offer

a
woman
candida
quite
quietly
and
you
eugene
what
do
you
offer
marchbanks
my
weakness
my
desolation
my
heart
need
candida
impressed
that
a
good
bid
eugene
now
i
know
how
to
make
my
choice
she
pauses
and
looks
curiously
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
weighing
them
morell
whose
lofty
confidence
has
changed
into
heartbreaking
dread
at
eugene
bid
loses
all
power
of
concealing
his
anxiety
eugene
strung
to
the
highest
tension
does
not
move
a
muscle
morell
in
a
suffocated
voice
the
appeal
bursting
from
the
depths
of
his
anguish
candida
marchbanks
aside
in
a
flash
of
contempt
coward
candida
significantly
i
give
myself
to
the
weaker
of
the
two
eugene
divines
her
meaning
at
once
his
face
whitens
like
steel
in
a
furnace
that
can
not
melt
it
morell
bowing
his
head
with
the
calm
of
collapse
i
accept
your
sentence
candida
candida
do
you
understand
eugene
marchbanks
oh
i
feel
i
lost
he
can
not
bear
the
burden
morell
incredulously
raising
his
bead
with
prosaic
abruptness
do
you
mean
me
candida
candida
smiling
a
little
let
us
sit
and
talk
comfortably
over
it
like
three
friends
to
morell
sit
down
dear
morell
takes
the
chair
from
the
fireside
the
children
chair
bring
me
that
chair
eugene
she
indicates
the
easy
chair
he
fetches
it
silently
even
with
something
like
cold
strength
and
places
it
next
morell
a
little
behind
him
she
sits
down
he
goes
to
the
sofa
and
sits
there
still
silent
and
inscrutable
when
they
are
all
settled
she
begins
throwing
a
spell
of
quietness
on
them
by
her
calm
sane
tender
tone
you
remember
what
you
told
me
about
yourself
eugene
how
nobody
has
cared
for
you
since
your
old
nurse
died
how
those
clever
fashionable
sisters
and
successful
brothers
of
yours
were
your
mother
and
father
pets
how
miserable
you
were
at
eton
how
your
father
is
trying
to
starve
you
into
returning
to
oxford
how
you
have
had
to
live
without
comfort
or
welcome
or
refuge
always
lonely
and
nearly
always
disliked
and
misunderstood
poor
boy
marchbanks
faithful
to
the
nobility
of
his
lot
i
had
my
books
i
had
nature
and
at
last
i
met
you
candida
never
mind
that
just
at
present
now
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
other
boy
here
my
boy
spoiled
from
his
cradle
we
go
once
a
fortnight
to
see
his
parents
you
should
come
with
us
eugene
and
see
the
pictures
of
the
hero
of
that
household
james
as
a
baby
the
most
wonderful
of
all
babies
james
holding
his
first
school
prize
won
at
the
ripe
age
of
eight
james
as
the
captain
of
his
eleven
james
in
his
first
frock
coat
james
under
all
sorts
of
glorious
circumstances
you
know
how
strong
he
is
i
hope
he
did
hurt
you
how
clever
he
is
how
happy
with
deepening
gravity
ask
james
mother
and
his
three
sisters
what
it
cost
to
save
james
the
trouble
of
doing
anything
but
be
strong
and
clever
and
happy
ask
me
what
it
costs
to
be
mother
and
three
sisters
and
wife
and
mother
to
his
children
all
in
one
ask
prossy
and
maria
how
troublesome
the
house
is
even
when
we
have
no
visitors
to
help
us
to
slice
the
onions
ask
the
tradesmen
who
want
to
worry
james
and
spoil
his
beautiful
sermons
who
it
is
that
puts
them
off
when
there
is
money
to
give
he
gives
it
when
there
is
money
to
refuse
i
refuse
it
i
build
a
castle
of
comfort
and
indulgence
and
love
for
him
and
stand
sentinel
always
to
keep
little
vulgar
cares
out
i
make
him
master
here
though
he
does
not
know
it
and
could
not
tell
you
a
moment
ago
how
it
came
to
be
so
with
sweet
irony
and
when
he
thought
i
might
go
away
with
you
his
only
anxiety
was
what
should
become
of
me
and
to
tempt
me
to
stay
he
offered
me
leaning
forward
to
stroke
his
hair
caressingly
at
each
phrase
his
strength
for
my
defence
his
industry
for
my
livelihood
his
position
for
my
dignity
his
relenting
ah
i
am
mixing
up
your
beautiful
sentences
and
spoiling
them
am
i
not
darling
she
lays
her
cheek
fondly
against
his
morell
quite
overcome
kneeling
beside
her
chair
and
embracing
her
with
boyish
ingenuousness
it
all
true
every
word
what
i
am
you
have
made
me
with
the
labor
of
your
hands
and
the
love
of
your
heart
you
are
my
wife
my
mother
my
sisters
you
are
the
sum
of
all
loving
care
to
me
candida
in
his
arms
smiling
to
eugene
am
i
your
mother
and
sisters
to
you
eugene
marchbanks
rising
with
a
fierce
gesture
of
disgust
ah
never
out
then
into
the
night
with
me
candida
rising
quickly
and
intercepting
him
you
are
not
going
like
that
eugene
marchbanks
with
the
ring
of
a
man
voice
no
longer
a
boy
in
the
words
i
know
the
hour
when
it
strikes
i
am
impatient
to
do
what
must
be
done
morell
rising
from
his
knee
alarmed
candida
do
let
him
do
anything
rash
candida
confident
smiling
at
eugene
oh
there
is
no
fear
he
has
learnt
to
live
without
happiness
marchbanks
i
no
longer
desire
happiness
life
is
nobler
than
that
parson
james
i
give
you
my
happiness
with
both
hands
i
love
you
because
you
have
filled
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
loved
he
goes
towards
the
door
candida
one
last
word
he
stops
but
without
turning
to
her
how
old
are
you
eugene
marchbanks
as
old
as
the
world
now
this
morning
i
was
eighteen
candida
going
to
him
and
standing
behind
him
with
one
hand
caressingly
on
his
shoulder
eighteen
will
you
for
my
sake
make
a
little
poem
out
of
the
two
sentences
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
and
will
you
promise
to
repeat
it
to
yourself
whenever
you
think
of
me
marchbanks
without
moving
say
the
sentences
candida
when
i
am
thirty
she
will
be
when
i
am
sixty
she
will
be
marchbanks
turning
to
her
in
a
hundred
years
we
shall
be
the
same
age
but
i
have
a
better
secret
than
that
in
my
heart
let
me
go
now
the
night
outside
grows
impatient
candida
she
takes
his
face
in
her
hands
and
as
he
divines
her
intention
and
bends
his
knee
she
kisses
his
forehead
then
he
flies
out
into
the
night
she
turns
to
morell
holding
out
her
arms
to
him
ah
james
they
embrace
but
they
do
not
know
the
secret
in
the
poet
heart
