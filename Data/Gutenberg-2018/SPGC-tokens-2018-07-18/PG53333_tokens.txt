preface
who
of
us
care
to
be
present
at
the
accouchment
of
the
immortal
i
think
that
we
so
attend
who
are
first
to
take
this
book
in
our
hands
a
bold
assertion
truly
and
one
demonstrable
only
in
years
remote
from
these
wages
no
war
with
dust
but
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
i
should
most
like
to
come
back
and
because
he
has
lent
himself
the
more
innocently
to
the
whispers
of
his
subconscious
daemon
and
because
he
has
set
those
murmurs
to
purer
and
harder
crystal
than
we
others
by
so
much
the
longer
will
the
poems
of
clark
ashton
smith
endure
here
indeed
is
loot
against
the
forays
of
moth
and
rust
here
we
shall
find
none
or
little
of
the
sentimental
fat
with
which
so
much
of
our
literature
is
larded
rather
shall
one
in
imagination
s
misty
see
elfin
rubies
burn
at
his
feet
glow
in
the
nearer
cypresses
and
feel
upon
his
brow
a
wind
from
the
unknown
the
brave
hunters
of
on
art
s
cathedral
windows
will
find
little
here
for
their
trouble
and
both
the
stupid
and
the
would
best
stare
owlishly
and
pass
by
here
are
neither
kindergartens
nor
skyscrapers
but
let
him
who
is
worthy
by
reason
of
his
clear
eye
and
unjaded
heart
wander
across
these
borders
of
beauty
and
mystery
and
be
glad

arabesque
like
arabesques
of

the
cypresses
in
silhouette
fantastically
cleave
and
fret
a
moon
of
yellow
ivory
the
coldly
colored
rays
illume
a
leafy
pattern
manifold
and
all
the
field
is
overscrolled
with
curiously
figured
gloom
like
arabesques
of
ebony
or
like
arabian
lattices
forever
seem
the
cypresses
before
a
moon
of
ivory
beyond
the
great
wall
beyond
the
far
cathayan
wall
a
thousand
leagues
athwart
the
sky
the
scarlet
stars
and
mornings
die
the
gilded
moons
and
sunsets
fall
across
the
sands
with
bales
of
silk
the
camels
fare
harnessed
with
vermil
and
with
vair
into
the
blue
and
burning
lands
and
ah
the
song
the
drivers
sing
to
while
the
desert
leagues
a
song
they
sang
in
old
cathay
ere
youth
had
left
the
eldest
king
ere
love
and
beauty
both
grew
old
and
wonder
and
romance
were
flown
on
fiery
wings
to
worlds
unknown
to
stars
of
undiscovered
gold
and
i
their
alien
words
would
know
and
follow
past
the
lonely
wall
where
gilded
moons
and
sunsets
fall
as
in
a
song
of
long
ago
to
omar
khayyam
omar
within
thy
scented
when
passed
with
eventide
the
starward
incense
of
the
waning
too
fair
and
dear
and
precious
to
abide
after
the
glad
and
golden
death
of
omar
thou
heardest
then
above
the
world
of
men
the
mournful
rumour
of
an
iron
wing
the
sough
and
sigh
of
desolating
years
whereof
the
wind
is
as
the
winds
that
blow
out
of
a
lonesome
land
of
night
and
snow
where
ancient
winter
weeps
with
frozen
tears
and
in
thy
bodeful
ears
the
brief
and
tiny
lisp
of
petals
curled
and
crisp
fallen
at
eve
in
persia
s
mellow
clime
was
mingled
with
the
mighty
sound
of
time
omar
thou
knewest
well
how
the
fair
days
are
sorrowful
and
strange
with
time
s
inexorable
mystery
and
terror
ineluctable
of
change
upon
thine
eyes
the
bleak
and
bitter
spell
of
vision
thou
didst
see
as
in
a
magic
glass
the
moulded
mists
and
painted
shadows
the
ghostly
pomps
we
name
reality
and
lo
the
level
field
with
broken
fane
and
throne
and
dust
of
old
unfabled
cities
sown
in
unremembering
years
was
made
to
yield
from
out
the
shards
of
pow
r
the
pillars
frail
and
small
that
lift
for
capital
the
bubble
of
the
r
and
crowns
were
crumbled
for
the
airy
gold
the
crocus
and
the
daffodil
should
hold
as
inalienable
dow
r
before
thy
gaze
the
sad
unvaried
green
the
cypresses
like
robes
funereal
wear
was
woven
on
the
gradual
looms
of
air
from
threadbare
silk
and
tattered
sendaline
that
clothed
some
ancient
queen
and
from
the
spoilt
vermilion
of
her
mouth
the
myrtles
rose
and
from
her
ruined
hair
and
eyes
that
held
the
summer
s
ardent
drouth
in
blown
forgotten
bow
rs
and
amber
limbs
and
breast
through
ancient
nights
by
sleepless
love
oppressed
or
by
the
iron
flight
of
loveless
hours
knowing
the
weary
wisdom
of
the
years
the
empty
truth
of
tears
the
suns
of
june
that
with
some
great
excess
of
ardour
slay
the
unabiding
rose
and
winter
wan
and
fervourless
for
whom
no
flower
grows
seeing
the
scarlet
and
the
gold
that
pales
on
orient
snows
untrod
in
magic
morns
that
grant
across
a
land
of
common
green
and
gray
the
disenchanted
day
knowing
the
iron
veils
and
walls
of
adamant
that
ward
the
flaming
verities
of
knowing
these
things
ah
surely
thou
wert
wise
beneath
the
warm
and
skies
to
kiss
on
ardent
breast
and
avid
mouth
some
girl
whose
sultry
eyes
were
golden
with
the
to
pluck
the
rose
and
drain
the
wine
in
gardens
before
the
broken
cup
be
filled
and
covered
up
in
dusty
seas
of
everlasting
drouth
strangeness
o
love
thy
lips
are
bright
and
cold
like
jewels
carven
curiously
to
symbols
of
a
mystery
a
secret
dim
forgotten
old
like
woven
amber
finely
spun
thy
hair
enwoofed
with
golden
light
remembers
yet
the
flaming
flight
of
some
unknown
archaic
sun
thine
eyes
are
crystals
green
and
chill
wherein
as
in
a
shifting
sea
wan
fires
and
drowning
splendours
flee
to
stealthy
deeps
forever
still
fallen
across
thy
dreaming
face
the
dawn
is
made
a
secret
thing
like
flame
of
crimson
lamps
that
swing
at
midnight
in
a
thy
smile
is
like
the
furtive
gleam
of
fleeing
moons
a
traveller
sees
through
closing
arms
of
in
secret
realms
of
night
and
dream
unsolved
eternally
thy
beauty
s
riddle
doth
abide
and
love
hath
come
and
love
hath
died
striving
to
read
the
mystery
the
infinite
quest
in
years
no
vision
shall
aver
in
lands
no
dream
may
name
tow
rd
alien
things
what
longings
were
and
thence
what
languors
came
for
each
horizon
straightly
sought
with
fealty
to
the
stars
what
death
and
weariness
were
bought
what
bitterness
what
bars
i
waken
unto
years
afar
and
find
the
quest
made
new
in
earth
that
was
perchance
a
star
unto
my
former

as

marvels

amid

desolation
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
lived
alone
as
one
that
liveth
in
a
dream
as
light
on
coldest
marble
or
the
gleam
of
moons
eternal
on
a
land
of
stone
the
dawns
have
been
to
me
i
have
but
known
the
silence
of
a
frozen
land
a
sole
attending
silence
all
supreme
as
is
the
sea
s
enormous
monotone
upon
the
icy
desert
of
my
days
no
bright
mirages
are
but
iron
rays
of
dawn
relentless
and
the
bitter
light
of
noon
alone
i
crave
the
friendly
clasp
of
finite
arms
to
save
my

from
the
ravening
infinite
the
orchid
beauty
thou
orchid
of
immortal
bloom
sprung
from

spheres
how

thou
tall
in

autumnal
years
with
the
red
rain
of
immemorial
doom
and
fragrant
where
but
lesser
suns
illume
for
sustenance
of
life
s
forgotten
tears
ever
thy
splendour
and
thy
light
appears
like
dawn
from
out
the
midnight
of
the
tomb
colours
and
gleams
and
glamours
unrecalled
richly
thy
petals
intricate
revive
blossom
whose
roots
are
in
eternity
the
faithful
soul
the
sentience
darkly
thralled
in
dream
and
wonder
evermore
shall
strive
at
edens
lost
of
time
and
memory
a
fragment
autumn
in
memory
that
saw
the
crisping
myrtles
fade
aeons
agone
my
tomb
was
made
beside
the
sea
ah
wonderful
its
portals
were
with
carven
doors
of
chrysolite
and
walls
of
sombre
syenite
they
wrought
mine
olden
sepulchre

timeless

leagued
in
malign
omnipotent
wearing
the
guise
of

despair

forever
drove
through
ashen
fields

my
soul

long
in

morphean
close

on

ruined
rose
fell
lightly
and

leaves
were

alas
alas

love
is
overlate
alone
we

not
where

found
the
white
and
purple
poppies
fair
nor
heard
the
summer
pass
importunate
ah
love
can
we
forgive
thy

it

its

its
when

fall
the

only
to
winds
of
night

dawn
for
she
is
gone
the
crucifixion
of

because
of
thee
immortal

hath
died
because
thy

will
not

thy

mine
a

must
weave
a
thorny
crown
for

the
crucified
behold
how
beautiful
the
limbs
that
the
limbs
that
bleed
o
stubborn
heart
for
us
still
are
the
lids
so
softly
tremulous
and
mute
the
mouth
of
our
eternal
need
though
this
thy
fearful
lips
would
now
deny
love
is
divine
and
can
not
wholly
die
draw
forth
the
nails
thy
tender
hands
have
and
we
will
know
the
mercy
infinite
will
find
redemption
in
our
own
delight
and
in
each
other
s
heart
the
only
heaven
the
exile
against
my
heart
your
heart
is
closed
you
bid
me
go
what
ways
are
left
in
all
the
world
for
love
to
know
desolate
oceans
and
the
light
of
lonely
plains
dead
moons
that
wander
in
the
wastes
of
ice
and
these
these
i
fain
would
see
and
find
the
splendid
bourne
of
sunset
or
the
brazen
deserts
of
the
morn
that
i
might
lose
this
loneliness
in
vaster
solitude
and
love
be
less
forlorn
faring
to
seek
with
alien
sun
and
alien
star
the
strange
the
veiled
horizons
infinite
and
far
spaces
of
fire
and
night
the
skies
of

where
foamless

black

the
pale
and
sorrowful
desire
whose
eyes
have
looked
on

seen
deep
in
the

serene
their

vain
light
inverted
ashen
fire
with

lilies
late
and
languishing

barren
love
to
thee
and
from
the
grievous
springs
of

far
in
the
great
maremma
of
my
heart
i
proffer
thee
to
drink
and
on
thy
mouth
with
the
one
kiss
wherein
we
meet

leave
fire
and
dust
from
quenchless
leagues
of
drouth
solution
the
ghostly
fire
that
walks
the
fen
tonight
thine
only
light
shall
be
on
lethal
ways
thy
soul
shall
pass
and
prove
the
stealthy
coiled
morass
with
mocking
mists
for
company
on
roads
thou
goest
not
again
to
shores
where
thou
hast
never
gone
fare
onward
though
the
shuddering
queach
and
waters
reach
like
of
acheron
beside
thee
and
the
twisten
reeds
as
a
witch
s
net
enwind
thy
knees
and
cling
and
clutch
like
wreathing
adders
though
the
touch
of
the
blind
air
be
dank
and
wet
as
from
a
wounded
thing
that
bleeds
in
cloud
and
darkness
fare
onward
where
thy
dreams
of
yore
in
splendour
drape
the
fetid
shore
and
pestilential
waters
dead
and
though
the
toads
irrision
rise
as
grinding
of
satanic
racks
and
spectral
willows
gaunt
and
grey
gibber
along
thy
shrouded
way
where
vipers
lie
with
livid
backs
and
watch
thee
with
their
sulphurous
eyes
fare
onward
till
thy
feet
shall
slip
deep
in
the
sudden
pool
ordained
and
all
the
noisome
draught
be
drained
that
turns
to
lethe
on
the
lip
the
tears
of
lilith
o
lovely
demon
hemlock
and
hydromel
and
gall
honey
and
aconite
and
wine
mingle
to
make
that
mouth
of
thy
mouth
i
love
but
most
of
all
it
is
thy
tears
that
i
thy
tears
like
that
fall
in
gardens
red
satanical
or
like
the
tears
of
mist
and
fire
wept
by
the
moon
that
wizards
use
to
secret
runes
when
they

but
how
with
these

the
unseen
splendour
and

and
harmony
and
sound
the
heart
hath
felt
the
sense
hath
never
found
no
shining
words
of

these
shall
the
poet
seek
eternally
whose
lines
would
carve
the
mask
of

the
years
are
a
falling
of
snow
slow
but
without
cessation
on
hills
and
mountains
and
flowers
and
worlds
that
were
but
snow
and
the
crawling
night
wherein
it
fell
may
be
washed
away
in
one
swifter
hour
of
flame
thus
it
was
that
some
slant
of
sunset
in
the
chasms
of
pilèd
transient
mountains
that
made
a
new
horizon
uplifting
the
west
to
fantastic
smote
warm
in
a
buried
realm
of
the
spirit
till
the
snows
of
forgetfulness
were
gone
clear
in
the
vistas
of
memory
the
peaks
of
a
world
long
unremembered
soared
further
than
clouds
but
fell
not
based
on
hills
that
shook
not
nor
melted
with
that
burden
enormous
hardly
to
be
believed
rent
with
stupendous
chasms
full
of
an
umber
twilight
i
beheld
that
larger
world
bright
was
the
twilight
sharp
like
ethereal
wine
above
but
low
in
the
clefts
it
thickened
dull
as
with
duskier
tincture
like
whimsical
wings
outspread
but
unstirring
flowers
that
seemed
spirits
of
the
twilight
that
must
pass
with
its
too
fragile
for
day
or
for
darkness
fed
the
dusk
with
more
delicate
hues
than
its
own
stars
that
were
nearer
more
radiant
than
ours
quivered
and
pulsed
in
the
clear
thin
gold
of
the
sky
these
things
i
beheld
till
the
gold
was
shaken
with
flight
of
fantastical
wings
like
broken
shadows
forerunning
the
darkness
till
the
twilight
shivered
with
outcry
of
eldritch
voices
like
pain
s
last
cry
ere
oblivion
song
i
bring
my
weariness
to
thee
my
bitter
dreams
i
bring
love
with
a
wounded
wing
and
life
consumed
of
memory
i
bring
to
thee
the
haven
of
thy
happy
of
this
my
dreams
are
fain
for
all
my
weary
pain
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
rest
but
on
thy
breast
haunting
there
is
no
peace
amid
the
moonlight
and
the
pines
deep
in
the
windless
gloom
the
lamplike
thought
of
you
abides
and
ah
what
burning
memories
pursue
my
heart
among
the
pallid
marbles
night
assigns
your
silver
face
for
wardress
of
the
doors
of
sleep
beyond
the
wild
last
bourn
of
dreamland
lo
your
eyes
are
on
the
lonesome
ultimate
undiscovered
skies
moonlike
and
dim
you
wander
ever
in
the
deep
which
is
the
secret
innermost
unknown
abyss
of
my
own
soul
and
in
its
night
your
spirit
lives
shall
i
not
find
the
very
draught
that
lethe
gives
sweet
with
your
tears
and
warm
with
savour
of
your
kiss
the
hidden
paradise
our
passion
is
a
secret
eden
of
lotos
and
the
fruitful
date
with
silence
walled
and
held
undesecrate
by
man
or
prying
seraph
we
are
wise
as
any
god
and
goddess
who
have
wrung
from
roseal
fruitage
of
a
bough
forbidden
the
happy
wine
we
drink
we
drink
unchidden
deep
in
the
vales
where
vernal
leaves
are
young
and
the
first
poppies
loiter
though
the
breath
of
all
the
gods
a
bolted
storm
prepare
and
gloom
of
thunders
blind
the
sun
shall
we
not
turn
with
clinging
kisses
there
and
laughing
quaff
some
dreamless
wine
of
triumphant
still
in
mere
oblivion
cleopatra
thy
beauty
is
the
warmth
and
languor
and
passion
of
a
tropic
autumn
caressing
all
the
senses
with
light
from
skies
of
heavy
azure
with
perfume
from
hidden
orchids
that
burn
in
the
berylline
dusk
of
palms
with
the
balmy
kiss
of
tropic
wind
and
wave
and
the
songs
of
exotic
birds
that
pass
in
flight
from
isle
to
isle
on
a
cobalt
sea
o
sweetness
in
the
inmost
sense
as
of
golden
fruits
that
have
grown
by
the
waters
of
lethe
or
fragrance
of
purple
lilies
crushed
by
the
limbs
of
lovers
in
the
shadow
of
a
wood
of
cypress
thou
pervadest
me
with
thy
love
as
the
dawn
pervadeth
a
valley
among
mountains
or
as
opaline
sunset
filleth
the
sea
the
desire
of
thy
heart
is
upon
me
as
a
wind
from
the
isle
of
cythera
where
aphrodite
waits
for
adonis
lying
naked
among
the
flag
lilies
by
a
pool
of
chrysolite
i
inhale
thy
love
as
the
breath
of
hidden
gardens
of
purple
and
scarlet
where
circe
wanders
clad
in
a
trailing
gown
whose
colours
are
the
gold
of
flame
and
the
azure
of
the
skies
of
autumn
ecstasy
blind
with
your
softly
fallen
hair
i
turn
me
from
the
twilight
air
and
ah
the
wordless
tale
of
love
my
lips
upon
your
lips
declare
high
stars
are
on
the
shadowy
unseen
unknown
the
urgent
drouth
of
desert
years
in
one
deep
kiss
would
drain
the
sweetness
of
your
mouth
our
straining
arms
that
clasp
and
close
ache
with
an
ecstasy
that
grows
and
passion
in
our
secret
veins
like
burning
amber
glows
and
glows
this
love
is
sweet
to
have
and
hold
better
than
sandalwood
or
gold
after
the
barren
bitter
loves
the
mad
and
mournful
loves
of
old
this
love
is
fortunate
and
fair
behind
its
veil
of
fallen
hair
this
love
hath
soft
and
clinging
arms
and
a
kind
bosom
warm
and
bare
union
as
the
fumes
of
myrrh
that
mix
with
the
odour
of
sandalwood
in
a
temple
sacred
to
the
goddess
lakme
as
moonlight
mingled
with
starlight
in
the
lucent
azure
of
an
autumn
lake
as
the
of
gold
and
crimson
that
interlace
on
a
couch
of
purple
even
so
beloved
hath
my
love
mingled
with
even
so
our
souls
are
one
like
two
winds
that
meet
in
a
valley
of
rose
and
lotus
and
fall
to
rest
uniting
as
the
still
and
fragrant
air
that
lingers
on
a
bed
of
falling
petals
psalm
my
beloved
is
a
well
of
clear
waters
to
which
i
have
come
at
noontide
from
the
land
of
the
abomination
of
desolation
from
the
waste
where
nothing
dwelleth
but
the
inconsolable
crying
of
an
evil
wind
and
the
wandering
realms
and
cities
of
the
wide
mirage
where
no
one
passeth
except
the
sun
who
walked
like
a
terrible
god
through
the
hell
of
the
brazen
skies
and
the
dreadful
cohorts
of
the
constellations
who
pass
remote
in
alien
years
and
clad
with
icy
azures
of
unattainable
distance
my
beloved
is
a
singing
fountain
set
in
a
wide
oasis
between
the
frondage
of
the
fruitful
palm
and
the
branches
of
the
flowering
myrtle
the
wind
that
bloweth
thereon
hath
lain
in
a
vale
of
cassia
and
myrrh
and
caressed
the
vermilion
blossoms
of
the
pomegranate
whose
red
is
the
red
of
the
lips
of
astarte
a
thousand
nightingales
are
gathered
there
from
all
the
gardens
of
lost
romance
and
plots
of
purple
and
silver
lillies
more
beautiful
than
the
meadows
of
mirage
revive
the
flowers
of
sabean
queens
and
the
blossoms
worn
by
all
the
princesses
of
legend
ah
suffer
me
to
dwell
thereby
and
forget
the
gilded
cities
of
desire
the
domes
of
spectral
gold
that
fled
from
horizon
to
horizon
before
me
and
left
my
feet
in
the
sinking
vales
and
shifting
plains
of
the
desert
whose
waters
are
green
with
corruption
and
bitter
with
the
dust
and
ashes
of
death
ah
suffer
me
to
sleep
in
the
shadows
of
the
palm
and
myrtle
by
the
fountain
in
november
with
autumn
and
the
flaring
leaves
our
love
must
ere
flauntful
spring
shall
mock
thy
tears
and
my
despair
with
blossoms
red
or
pale
some
april
bride
may
wear
now
while
the
weary
grey
forgetful
heavens
bend
above
the
grief
and
languor
of
the
dying
lands
in
one
last
kiss
shall
meet
and
mingle
and
expire
the
muted
last
remembering
sighs
of
our
desire
and
on
my
face
the
burden
of
thy
hands
shall
rest
a
little
and
be
taken
tenderly
and
ah
how
lightly
hence
and
in
thy
golden
eyes
thy
love
and
all
the
ashen
glory
of
the
skies
shall
mingle
and
as
in
a
mirror
lie
for
me
symbols
no
more
of
gold
and
marble
nor
of
snow
and
sunlight
and
vermilion
would
i
make
my
vision
and
my
symbols
nor
would
take
the
auroral
flame
of
some
prismatic
floe
nor
iris
of
the
frail
and
lunar
bow
flung
on
the
shafted
waterfalls
that
wake
the
night
s
blue
slumber
in
a
shadowy
lake
to
body
forth
my
fantasies
and
show
communicable
mystery
i
would
find
in
adamantine
darkness
of
the
earth
metals
untouched
of
any
sun
and
bring
black
azures
of
the
nether
sea
to
or
fetch
the
secret
splendid
leaves
and
blind
blue
lilies
of
an
atlantean
spring
the
or
the
apocalypse
of
evil
bow
down
i
am
the
emperor
of
dreams
i
crown
me
with
the
sun
of
secret
worlds
incredible
and
take
their
trailing
skies
for
vestment
when
i
soar
throned
on
the
mounting
zenith
and
illume
the
horizons
infinite
like
rampant
monsters
roaring
for
their
glut
the
oceans
rise
and
rise
by
jealous
moons
maleficently
urged
to
follow
me
forever
mountains
horned
with
peaks
of
sharpest
adamant
and
mawed
with
volcanoes
usurp
the
skies
with
thunder
but
in
vain
and
continents
of
trees
with
slimy
trunks
that
lengthen
league
by
league
pursue
my
flight
through
ages
spurned
to
fire
by
that
supreme
ascendance
sorcerers
and
evil
kings
predominantly
armed
with
scrolls
of
fulvous
whereon
are
runes
of
flame
would
stay
me
and
the
sirens
of
the
stars
with
songs
from
silver
fragrance
wrought
would
lure
me
to
their
crystal
reefs
and
moons
where
senescent
devils
dwell
with
antic
gnomes
abominably
wise
heave
up
their
icy
horns
across
my
way
but
naught
deters
me
from
the
goal
ordained
by
suns
and
aeons
and
immortal
wars
and
sung
by
moons
and
motes
the
goal
whose
name
is
all
the
secret
of
forgotten
glyphs
by
sinful
gods
in
torrid
rubies
writ
for
ending
of
a
brazen
book
the
goal
whereat
my
soaring
ecstacy
may
stand
in
amplest
heavens
multiplied
to
hold
my
hordes
of
avatars
and
promethèan
armies
of
my
thought
that
brandish
claspèd
levins
there
i
call
my
memories
intolerably
clad
in
light
the
peaks
of
paradise
may
wear
and
lead
the
armageddon
of
my
dreams
whose
instant
shout
of
triumph
is
become
immensity
s
own
music
for
their
feet
are
founded
on
innumerable
worlds
remote
in
alien
epochs
and
their
arms
upraised
are
columns
potent
to
exalt
with
ease
ineffable
the
countless
thrones
of
all
the
gods
that
are
and
gods
to
be
or
bear
the
seats
of
asmadai
and
set
above
the
seventh
paradise
supreme
in
culminant
omniscience
manifold
and
served
by
senses
multitudinous
on
the
shifting
walls
of
time
with
eyes
that
roam
the
fields
of
utter
night
and
chaos
i
convoke
the
babel
of
their
visions
and
attend
at
once
their
myriad
witness
i
behold
in
ombos
where
the
fallen
titans
dwell
with
walls
and
gulfs
for
moat
the
secret
cleft
that
cunning
dwarves
have
dug
beneath
an
buttress
and
i
list
too
late
the
clang
of
adamantine
gongs
dinned
by
their
drowsy
guardians
whose
feet
have
felt
the
sting
of
little
knives
embrued
with
slobber
of
the
basilisk
or
juice
of
wounded
upas
and
i
see
in
gardens
of
a
world
the
sacred
flow
r
with
lips
of
purple
flesh
and
eyes
of
torpid
azure
whom
his
furtive
priests
at
moonless
eve
in
terror
seek
to
slay
with
bubbling
grails
of
sacrificial
blood
that
hide
a
hueless
poison
and
i
read
upon
the
tongue
of
a
forgotten
sphinx
the
annuling
word
a
spiteful
demon
wrote
with
gall
of
slain
chimeras
and
i
know
what
pentacles
the
lunar
wizards
use
that
once
allured
the
roc
with
ten
great
wings
of
furlèd
storm
to
pause
midmost
an
alabaster
mount
and
there
with
webs
of
dragons
uplift
by
cranes
a
captive
giant
built
they
wound
the
monstrous
bird
and
plucked
from
off
his
feet
uranian
sapphires
fast
in
frozen
blood
with
amethysts
from
mars
i
lean
to
read
with
mages
in
an
evil
star
the
monstrous
archives
of
a
war
that
ran
through
wasted
aeons
and
the
prophecy
of
wars
renewed
that
shall
commemorate
some
enmity
of
kings
even
to
the
brink
of
time
i
know
the
blooms
of
bluish
fungus
freaked
with
mercury
that
bloat
within
the
craters
of
the
moon
and
in
one
still
selenic
hour
have
shrunk
to
pools
of
slime
and
fetor
and
i
know
what
clammy
blossoms
blanched
and
are
proffered
in
uranus
to
their
gods
by
peoples
and
the
livid
seed
of
some
black
fruit
a
king
in
saturn
ate
which
cast
upon
his
tinkling
took
root
between
the
burnished
flags
and
now
hath
mounted
and
become
a
hellish
tree
whose
lithe
and
hairy
branches
lined
with
mouths
net
like
a
hundred
ropes
his
lurching
throne
and
strain
at
starting
pillars
i
behold
the
corals
that
usurp
some
harbour
of
a
sea
and
sun
them
on
the
wharves
of
bulks
of
enormous
crimson
and
lifting
up
as
crowns
the
octiremes
of
perished
emperors
and
galleys
fraught
with
royal
gems
that
sailed
from
a
haven
swifter
grow
the
visions
now
a
mighty
city
looms
hewn
from
a
hill
of
purest
cinnabar
to
domes
and
turrets
like
a
sunrise
thronged
with
tier
on
tier
of
captive
moons
in
shifting
erubescence
but
whose
hands
were
sculptors
of
its
doors
and
columns
wrought
to
semblance
of
prodigious
blooms
of
old
no
eremite
hath
lingered
there
to
say
and
no
man
comes
to
learn
for
long
ago
a
prophet
came
warning
its
timid
king
against
the
plague
of
lichens
that
had
crept
across
subverted
empires
and
the
sand
of
wastes
that
cyclopean
mountains
ward
which
slow
and
ineluctable
would
come
to
take
his
fiery
bastions
and
his
fanes
and
quench
his
domes
with
greenish
tetter
now
i
see
a
host
of
naked
giants
armed
with
horns
of
behemoth
and
unicorn
who
wander
blinded
by
the
clinging
spells
of
hostile
wizardry
and
stagger
on
to
forests
where
the
very
leaves
have
eyes
and
ebonies
like
wrathful
dragons
roar
to
teaks
in
the
loathly
gloom
where
coiled
lianas
lean
with
serried
fangs
from
writhing
palms
with
swollen
boles
that
moan
where
leeches
of
a
scarlet
moss
have
sucked
the
eyes
of
some
dead
monster
and
have
crawled
to
bask
upon
his
spine
where
blossoms
hiss
and
sing
or
yawn
with
mouths
that
drip
a
sluggish
dew
whose
touch
is
death
and
slow
corrosion
then
i
watch
a
war
of
pigmies
met
by
night
with
pitter
of
their
drums
of
parrot
s
hide
on
plains
with
no
horizon
where
a
god
might
lose
his
way
for
centuries
and
there
in
wreathèd
light
and
fulgors
all
convolved
a
rout
of
green
enormous
moons
ascend
with
rays
that
like
a
shivering
venom
run
on
swords
of
surveyed
from
this
my
throne
as
from
a
central
sun
the
pageantries
of
worlds
and
cycles
pass
forgotten
splendours
dream
by
dream
unfold
like
tapestry
and
vanish
violet
suns
or
suns
of
changeful
iridescence
bring
their
rays
about
me
like
the
coloured
lights
imploring
priests
might
lift
to
glorify
the
face
of
some
averted
god
the
songs
of
mystic
poets
in
a
purple
world
ascend
to
me
in
music
that
is
made
from
unconceivèd
perfumes
and
the
pulse
of
love
ineffable
the
whose
lutes
are
strung
with
gold
of
the
utmost
moon
call
forth
delicious
languors
never
known
save
to
their
golden
kings
the
sorcerers
of
hooded
stars
inscrutable
to
god
surrender
me
their
scrolls
inscribed
with
lore
of
monstrous
alchemies
and
awful
transformations
if
i
will
i
am
at
once
the
vision
and
the
seer
and
mingle
with
my
pomps
and
still
abide
their
suzerain
i
am
the
neophyte
who
serves
a
nameless
god
within
whose
fane
the
fanes
of
hecatompylos
were
arks
the
titan
worshippers
might
bear
or
flags
to
pave
the
threshold
or
i
am
the
god
himself
who
calls
the
fleeing
clouds
into
the
nave
where
suns
might
congregate
and
veils
the
darkling
mountain
of
his
face
with
fold
on
solemn
fold
for
whom
the
priests
amass
their
monthly
hecatomb
of
opals
that
are
a
load
and
monstrous
alabraundines
won
from
war
with
realms
of
hostile
serpents
which
arise
combustible
in
vapours
and
perfumes
it
is
i
the
king
who
holds
with
hand
the
helm
of
some
great
barge
of
chrysolite
sailing
upon
an
amethystine
sea
to
isles
of
timeless
summer
for
the
snows
of
hyperborean
winter
and
their
winds
sleep
in
his
capital
nor
any
charm
of
wizardry
nor
conjured
suns
may
rout
them
so
he
flees
with
captive
kings
to
urge
his
serried
oars
hopeful
of
dales
where
amaranthine
dawn
hath
never
left
the
faintly
sighing
lote
and
fields
of
lisping
moly
or
i
fare
impanoplied
with
azure
diamond
as
hero
of
a
quest
achernar
lights
to
deserts
filled
with
flames
that
feed
upon
the
sullen
marl
and
soar
to
wrap
the
slopes
of
mountains
and
to
leap
with
tongues
intolerably
lengthening
that
lick
the
blenchèd
heavens
but
there
lives
secure
as
in
a
garden
walled
from
wind
a
lonely
flower
by
a
placid
well
midmost
the
flaring
tumult
of
the
flames
that
roar
as
roars
the
sea
implacable
forever
and
within
that
simple
grail
the
blossom
lifts
there
lies
one
drop
of
an
incomparable
dew
which
heals
the
parchèd
weariness
of
kings
and
cures
the
wound
of
wisdom
i
am
page
to
an
emperor
who
reigns
ten
thousand
years
and
through
his
labyrinthine
through
courts
and
colonnades
and
balconies
wherein
immensity
itself
is
mazed
i
seek
the
golden
gorget
he
hath
lost
on
which
the
names
of
his
conniving
stars
are
writ
in
little
sapphires
and
i
roam
for
centuries
and
hear
the
brazen
clocks
innumerably
clang
with
such
a
sound
as
brazen
hammers
make
by
devils
dinned
on
tombs
of
all
the
dead
and
nevermore
i
find
the
gorget
but
at
length
i
find
a
sealèd
room
whose
nameless
prisoner
moans
with
a
nameless
torture
and
would
turn
to
hell
s
red
rack
as
to
a
lilied
couch
from
that
whereon
they
stretched
him
and
i
find
prostrate
upon
a
floor
the
loveliest
of
all
beloved
slaves
my
emperor
hath
and
from
her
pulseless
side
a
serpent
rises
whiter
than
the
root
of
some
venefic
bloom
in
darkness
grown
and
gazes
up
with
eyes
that
seem
like
drops
of
cold
congealing
poison
hark
what
word
was
whispered
in
a
tongue
unknown
in
crypts
of
some
impenetrable
world
whose
is
the
dark
dethroning
secrecy
i
can
not
share
though
i
am
king
of
suns
and
king
therewith
of
strong
eternity
whose
gnomons
with
their
swords
of
shadow
guard
my
gates
and
slay
the
intruder
silence
loads
the
wind
of
ether
and
the
worlds
are
still
to
hear
the
word
that
flees
me
all
my
dreams
fall
like
a
rack
of
fuming
vapours
raised
to
semblance
by
a
necromant
and
leave
spirit
and
sense
unthinkably
alone
above
a
universe
of
shrouded
stars
and
suns
that
wander
cowled
with
sullen
gloom
like
witches
to
a
sabbath
fear
is
born
in
crypts
below
the
nadir
and
hath
crawled
reaching
the
floor
of
space
and
waits
for
wings
to
lift
it
upward
like
a
hellish
worm
fain
for
the
flesh
of
seraphs
eyes
that
gleam
but
are
not
eyes
of
suns
or
galaxies
gather
and
throng
to
the
base
of
darkness
flame
behind
some
black
abysmal
curtain
burns
implacable
and
fanned
to
whitest
wrath
by
raisèd
wings
that
flail
the
whiffled
gloom
and
make
a
brief
and
broken
wind
that
moans
as
one
who
rides
a
throbbing
rack
there
is
a
thing
that
crouches
worlds
and
years
remote
whose
horns
a
demon
sharpens
rasping
forth
a
note
to
shatter
the
of
time
and
crack
the
sphere
of
crystal
all
is
dark
for
ages
and
my
tolling
heart
suspends
its
clamour
as
within
the
clutch
of
death
tightening
with
tense
hermetic
rigours
then
in
one
enormous
flame
the
stars
unveil
the
suns
remove
their
cowls
and
beam
to
their
responding
planets
time
is
mine
once
more
and
armies
of
its
dreams
rally
to
that
insuperable
throne
firmed
on
the
central
zenith
now
i
seek
the
meads
of
shining
moly
i
had
found
in
some
remoter
vision
by
a
stream
no
cloud
hath
ever
tarnished
where
the
sun
a
gold
narcissus
loiters
evermore
above
his
golden
image
but
i
find
a
corpse
the
ebbing
water
will
not
keep
with
eyes
like
sapphires
that
have
lain
in
hell
and
felt
the
hissing
embers
and
the
flow
rs
about
me
turn
to
hooded
serpents
swayed
by
flutes
of
devils
in
a
hellish
dance
meet
for
the
nod
of
satan
when
he
reigns
above
the
raging
sabbath
and
is
wooed
by
sarabands
of
witches
but
i
turn
to
mountains
guarding
with
their
horns
of
snow
the
source
of
that
befoulèd
rill
and
seek
a
pinnacle
where
none
but
eagles
climb
and
they
with
failing
pennons
but
in
vain
i
flee
for
on
that
pylon
of
the
sky
some
curse
hath
turned
the
unprinted
snow
to
red
fires
that
curl
and
cluster
to
my
tread
trying
the
summit
s
narrow
cirque
and
now
i
see
a
silver
python
far
vast
as
a
river
that
a
fiend
hath
witched
and
forced
to
flow
remèant
in
its
course
to
fountains
whence
it
issued
rapidly
it
winds
from
slope
to
crumbling
slope
and
fills
ravines
and
chasmal
gorges
till
the
crags
totter
with
coil
on
coil
incumbent
soon
it
hath
entwined
the
pinnacle
i
keep
and
gapes
with
a
fanged
unfathomable
maw
wherein
great
typhon
and
enceladus
were
orts
of
daily
glut
but
i
am
gone
for
at
my
call
a
hippogriff
hath
come
and
firm
between
his
wings
i
mount
the
sheer
cerulean
walls
of
noon
and
see
the
earth
a
spurnèd
pebble
fall
lost
in
the
fields
of
nether
seek
a
planet
where
the
outwearied
wings
of
time
might
pause
and
furl
for
respite
or
the
plumes
of
death
be
stayed
and
loiter
in
reprieve
above
some
deathless
lily
for
therein
beauty
hath
found
an
avatar
of
flow
blossoms
that
clothe
it
as
a
coloured
flame
from
peak
to
peak
from
pole
to
sullen
pole
and
turn
the
skies
to
perfume
there
i
find
a
lonely
castle
calm
and
unbeset
save
by
the
purple
spears
of
amaranth
and
iris
walls
upbuilt
of
flushèd
marble
wonderful
with
rose
and
domes
like
golden
bubbles
and
minarets
that
take
the
clouds
as
are
mine
for
voiceless
looms
the
peaceful
barbican
and
the
portcullis
hangs
aloft
as
if
to
smile
a
welcome
so
i
leave
my
hippogriff
to
crop
the
magic
meads
and
pass
into
a
court
the
lilies
hold
and
tread
them
to
a
fragrance
that
pursues
to
win
the
portico
whose
columns
carved
of
lazuli
and
amber
mock
the
palms
of
bright
aidennic
with
fronds
of
stone
fretted
to
airy
lace
enfolding
drupes
that
seem
as
tawny
clusters
of
breasts
of
unknown
houris
and
convolved
with
vines
of
shut
and
flow
rs
like
the
dropt
lids
of
women
that
endure
some
rapture
through
a
door
enlaid
with
lilies
twined
luxuriously
i
enter
dazed
and
blinded
with
the
sun
and
hear
in
gloom
that
changing
colours
cloud
a
chuckle
sharp
as
crepitating
ice
upheaved
and
cloven
by
shoulders
of
the
damned
who
strive
in
antenora
when
my
eyes
undazzle
and
the
cloud
of
colour
fades
i
find
me
in
a
room
where
marble
apes
with
wings
of
griffins
crowd
on
walls
an
evil
sculptor
wrought
and
beasts
wherein
the
sloth
and
unite
pendulous
by
their
toes
of
tarnished
bronze
usurp
the
shadowy
interval
of
lamps
that
hang
from
ebon
arches
like
a
ripple
borne
by
the
wind
from
pool
to
sluggish
pool
in
fields
where
wide
cocytus
flows
his
bound
a
crackling
smile
around
that
circle
runs
and
all
the
gibbons
stare
at
me
with
eyes
that
turn
to
glowing
coals
a
fear
that
found
no
name
in
babel
flings
me
on
breathless
and
faint
with
horror
to
a
hall
within
whose
weary
round
the
languid
curtains
heavier
than
palls
unnumerably
depict
a
weary
king
who
fain
would
cool
his
hands
in
lakes
of
emerald
evening
or
the
fields
of
dreamless
poppies
pure
with
rain
i
flee
onward
and
all
the
shadowy
curtains
shake
with
tremors
of
a
mirth
and
whispers
of
the
innumerable
king
breathing
a
tale
of
ancient
pestilence
whose
very
words
are
vile
contagion
then
i
reach
a
room
where
caryatids
carved
in
the
form
of
tall
voluptuous
titan
women
surround
a
throne
of
flowering
ebony
where
creeps
a
vine
of
crystal
on
the
throne
there
lolls
a
wan
enormous
worm
whose
bulk
tumid
with
all
the
rottenness
of
kings
o
erflows
its
arms
with
fold
on
creasèd
fold
of
fat
obscenely
bloating
he
leans
and
from
his
throat
a
score
of
tongues
depending
like
to
wreaths
of
torpid
vipers
drivel
with
phosphorescent
slime
that
runs
down
all
his
length
of
soft
and
monstrous
folds
and
creeping
among
the
flow
rs
of
ebony
lends
them
the
life
of
tiny
serpents
now
ere
the
horror
ope
those
red
and
lashless
slits
of
eyes
that
draw
the
gnat
and
midge
i
turn
and
follow
down
a
dusty
hall
whose
gloom
lined
by
the
statues
with
their
mighty
limbs
ends
in
a
balcony
sphering
the
flowered
horizon
ere
my
heart
hath
hushed
the
panic
tumult
of
its
pulses
i
listen
from
beyond
the
horizon
s
rim
a
mutter
faint
as
when
the
far
simoon
mounting
from
unknown
deserts
opens
forth
wide
as
the
waste
those
wings
of
torrid
night
that
fling
the
doom
of
cities
from
their
folds
and
musters
in
its
van
a
thousand
winds
that
with
disrooted
palms
for
besoms
rise
and
sweep
the
sands
to
fury
as
the
storm
approaching
mounts
and
loudens
to
the
ears
of
them
that
toil
in
fields
of
sesame
so
grows
the
mutter
and
a
shadow
creeps
above
the
gold
horizon
like
a
dawn
of
darkness
climbing
sunward
now
they
come
a
sabbath
of
abominable
shapes
led
by
the
fiends
and
lamiae
of
worlds
that
owned
my
sway
aforetime
cockatrice
python
tragelaphus
leviathan
chimera
martichoras
behemoth
geryon
and
sphinx
and
hydra
on
my
ken
arise
as
might
some
city
consummate
in
the
lifting
of
a
lash
with
thundrous
domes
and
sounding
obelisks
and
towers
of
night
and
fire
alternate
wings
of
stone
along
the
hissing
wind
bear
up
the
huge
and
beasts
of
hells
beyond
rutilicus
and
things
whose
lightless
length
would
mete
the
gyre
of
born
from
the
caverns
of
a
dying
sun
uncoil
to
the
very
zenith
half
disclosed
from
gulfs
below
the
horizon
octopi
like
blazing
moons
with
countless
arms
of
fire
climb
from
the
seas
of
flame
that
roll
and
roar
through
planets
unconsumed
beating
on
coasts
of
unknown
metals
beasts
that
range
the
mighty
worlds
of
alioth
rise
aforesting
the
heavens
with
multitudinous
horns
within
whose
maze
the
winds
are
lost
and
borne
on
brows
of
plunging
scolopendras
the
tow
rs
of
loom
and
gods
and
demons
throned
on
sable
dragons
and
the
cockodrills
that
bear
the
spleenful
pygmies
on
their
backs
and
wizards
from
the
worlds
of
saiph
on
whom
titanic
scorpions
fawn
and
armies
that
move
with
fronts
reverted
from
the
foe
and
strike
athwart
their
shoulders
at
the
shapes
their
shields
reflect
in
crystal
and
eidola
fashioned
within
unfathomable
caves
by
hands
of
eyeless
peoples
and
the
blind
and
monsters
of
a
sunless
world
with
krakens
from
the
ultimate
abyss
and
demogorgons
of
the
outer
dark
arising
shout
with
multitudinous
thunders
and
threatening
me
with
dooms
ineffable
in
words
whereat
the
heavens
leap
to
flame
advance
on
the
magic
palace
thrown
before
for
league
on
league
their
blasting
shadows
blight
and
eat
like
fire
the
amaranthine
meads
leaving
an
ashen
desert
in
the
palace
i
hear
the
apes
of
marble
shriek
and
howl
and
all
the
columns
moan
babbling
with
unknown
terror
in
my
fear
a
monstrous
dread
unnamed
in
any
hell
i
rise
and
flee
with
the
fleeing
wind
for
wings
and
in
a
trice
the
magic
palace
reels
and
spiring
to
a
single
tow
r
of
flame
goes
out
and
leaves
nor
shard
nor
ember
flown
beyond
the
world
upon
that
fleeing
wind
i
reach
the
gulf
s
irrespirable
verge
where
fails
the
strongest
storm
for
breath
and
fall
supportless
through
the
gloom
beyond
the
scope
and
vision
of
the
sun
to
other
skies
and
systems
in
a
world
with
the
fungi
that
soar
to
semblance
of
fantastic
palms
i
fall
as
falls
the
and
break
a
score
of
trunks
to
powder
all
unhurt
i
rise
and
through
the
illimitable
woods
among
the
trees
of
flimsy
opal
roam
and
see
their
tops
that
clamber
hour
by
hour
to
touch
the
suns
of
iris
things
unseen
whose
charnel
breath
informs
the
tideless
air
with
spreading
pools
of
fetor
follow
me
elusive
past
the
palms
and
pittering
moths
with
wide
and
ashen
wings
flit
on
before
and
insects
descending
hurtle
through
the
gorgeous
gloom
and
quench
themselves
in
crumbling
thickets
heard
the
roar
of
beasts
unknown
resounds
at
measured
intervals
of
time
shaking
the
riper
trees
to
dust
that
falls
in
clouds
of
acrid
perfume
stifling
me
beneath
a
pall
of
iris
now
the
palms
grow
far
apart
and
lessen
momently
to
shrubs
a
dwarf
might
topple
over
them
i
see
an
empty
desert
all
ablaze
with
amethysts
and
rubies
and
the
dust
of
garnets
or
carnelians
on
i
roam
treading
the
gorgeous
grit
that
dazzles
me
with
leaping
waves
of
endless
rutilance
whereby
the
air
is
turned
to
a
crimson
gloom
through
which
i
wander
blind
as
any
kobold
till
underfoot
the
griding
sands
give
place
to
stone
or
metal
with
a
massive
ring
more
welcome
to
mine
ears
than
golden
bells
or
tinkle
of
silver
fountains
when
the
gloom
of
crimson
lifts
i
stand
upon
the
edge
of
a
broad
black
plain
of
adamant
that
reaches
level
as
a
windless
water
to
the
verge
of
all
the
world
and
through
the
sable
plain
a
hundred
streams
of
shattered
marble
run
and
streams
of
broken
steel
and
streams
of
bronze
like
to
the
ruin
of
all
the
wars
of
time
to
plunge
with
clangour
of
timeless
cataracts
adown
the
gulfs
eternal
so
i
follow
between
a
river
of
steel
and
a
river
of
bronze
with
ripples
loud
and
tuneless
as
the
clash
of
a
million
lutes
and
come
to
the
precipice
from
which
they
fall
and
make
the
mighty
sound
of
a
million
swords
that
meet
a
million
shields
or
din
of
spears
and
armour
in
the
wars
of
all
the
worlds
and
aeons
far
beneath
they
fall
through
gulfs
and
cycles
of
the
void
and
vanish
like
a
stream
of
broken
stars
into
the
nether
darkness
nor
the
gods
of
any
sun
nor
demons
of
the
gulf
will
dare
to
know
what
everlasting
sea
is
fed
thereby
and
mounts
forevermore
with
mighty
tides
unebbing
lo
what
cloud
or
night
of
sudden
and
supreme
eclipse
is
on
the
suns
of
opal
at
my
side
the
rivers
rail
with
a
wan
and
ghostly
gleam
through
darkness
falling
as
the
night
that
falls
from
mighty
spheres
extinguished
turning
now
i
see
betwixt
the
desert
and
the
suns
the
poised
wings
of
all
the
in
black
occlusion
through
stars
and
deeps
and
devastated
worlds
upon
my
trail
of
terror
griffins
rocs
and
sluggish
dark
chimeras
after
the
ravin
of
dispeopled
lands
with
harpies
and
the
of
hot
from
abominable
feasts
and
fain
to
cool
their
beaks
and
talons
in
my
all
all
have
gathered
and
the
wingless
rear
with
rank
on
rank
of
foul
colossal
worms
like
pillars
of
embattled
night
and
flame
looms
on
the
wide
horizon
from
the
van
i
hear
the
shriek
of
wyvers
loud
and
shrill
as
tempests
in
a
broken
fane
and
roar
of
sphinxes
like
the
unrelenting
toll
of
bells
from
tow
rs
infernal
cloud
on
cloud
they
arch
the
zenith
and
a
dreadful
wind
falls
from
them
like
the
wind
before
the
storm
and
in
the
wind
my
cloven
garment
streams
and
flutters
in
the
face
of
all
the
void
even
as
flows
a
flaffing
spirit
lost
on
the
pit
s
undying
tempest
louder
grows
the
thunder
of
the
streams
of
stone
and
redoubled
with
the
roar
of
torrent
wings
inseparably
mingled
scarce
i
keep
my
footing
in
the
gulfward
winds
of
fear
and
mighty
thunders
beating
to
the
void
in
waves
incessant
and
would
flee
with
them
and
prove
the
night
where
fall
the
streams
of
ruin
but
when
i
reach
the
verge
and
seek
through
gloom
to
measure
with
my
gaze
the
dread
descent
i
see
a
tiny
star
within
the
a
light
that
stays
me
while
the
wings
of
doom
convene
their
thickening
thousands
for
the
star
increases
taking
to
its
hueless
orb
with
all
the
speed
of
dreams
the
light
as
of
a
million
million
moons
and
floating
up
through
gulfs
and
glooms
eclipsed
it
grows
and
grows
a
huge
white
eyeless
face
that
fills
the
void
and
fills
the
universe
and
bloats
against
the
limits
of
the
world
with
lips
of
flame
that
open
the
sorrow
of
the
winds
o
winds
that
pass
uncomforted
through
all
the
peacefulness
of
spring
and
tell
the
trees
your
sorrowing
that
they
must
mourn
till
ye
are
fled
think
ye
the
tyrian
distance
holds
the
crystal
of
unquestioned
sleep
that
those
forgetful
purples
keep
no
veiled
contentious
greens
and
golds
half
with
communicated
grief
half
that
they
are
not
free
to
pass
with
you
across
the
flickering
grass
mourns
each
inclined
bough
and
leaf
and
i
with
soul
disquieted
shall
find
within
the
haunted
spring
no
peace
till
your
strange
sorrowing
is
down
the
tyrian
distance
fled
artemis
in
the
green
and
flowerless
garden
i
have
dreamt
lying
beneath
perennial
moons
apart
whose
bowr
s
and
myrtles
none
shall
part
in
the
funereal
maze
of
larch
and
laurel
across
white
lawns
athwart
the
spectral
mountains
seen
through
the
sighing
haze
of
all
the
high
and
fountains
with
feet
enshaded
by
the
fruitless
green
of
summer
trees
that
bear
no
summer
blossom
with
wintry
lusters
laid
upon
the
mounded
marble
of
thy
bosom
thou
dost
await
o
mournful
enigmatic
image
of
artemis
whose
tender
lips
too
late
or
all
too
soon
have
sought
the
wounding
kiss
love

not
yours

it

the

through
which
our
pauseless

are
driven
into
the
vast
and
desert
noon
love
is
not
mine
love

not
yours
it
is
a
flying
fire
that
passes
perishing
on
the
blind
morasses
after
the
frail
and
perished
moon
the
city
in
the
desert
in
a
lost
land
that
only
dreams
have
known
where
flaming
suns
walk
naked
and
alone
among
horizons
bright
as
molten
brass
and
glowing
heavens
like
furnaces
of

it
rears
with
dome
and

manifold
rich
as
a
dawn
of
amarant
and
gold

gorgeous
as
the
phoenix
born
of
fire
and
soaring
from
an
opalescent
pyre

to
the
zenith

anademe
of

to
flame

the

dimly
down
through

from

in
those
waters
with

fear
where

autumnal
in

pleasances
where

was

blossom
the
mournful
immortelles
alone
the
fallen
roses
crumble
and
are
blown
a
snow
of
red
about
the
barren
sward
the
misty
sun
is
grown
a
dimmer
gold
only
the
leaves
the
leaves
forever
seem
to
tell
and
treasure
in
a
gorgeous
dream
the
aureate
fervour
of
the
dawns
of
old
only
for
us
remains
the
memory
of
sultry
moons
and
summer
suns
that
were
and
we
have
found
where
fallen
roses
stir
the
immortelles
that
flower
mournfully
chant
of
autumn
like
the
voice
of
a
golden
star
heard
from
afar
perishing
beauty
calls
out
of
the
mist
and
rain
like
the
song
of
a
silver
wind
when
the
night
is
blind
murmuring
music
falls
never
to
rise
again
voice
of
the
leaves
that
die
whisper
and
sigh
of
ruinous
gardens
waning
rose
by
ungathered
rose
dolour
of
pines
immortal
that
guard
the
portal
of
a
lonely
mead
retaining
blossoms
that
no
man
knows
voices
of
love
and
the
autumn
in
my
heart
ye
are
one
fairer
the
petals
that
fall
dearer
the
beauty
that
dies
and
the
pyres
of
autumn
burning
than
a
thousand
springs
returning
o
perishing
loves
that
call
in
my
heart
and
the
hollow
skies
echo
of
memnon
i
wandered
ere
the
dream
was
done
where
over
nilus
nenuphars
with
all
its
ears
of
quivering
stars
the
darkness
listened
for
the
sun
ere
shadows
were
ere
night
was
gone
i
found
the
one
whom
suns
had
sought
and
waiting
at
his
feet
methought
had
speech
with
memnon
in
the
dawn
sad
as
the
last
lamenting
star
he
sang
and
clear
as
morning
s
gold
unto
his
voice
i
saw
unfold
the
hesitant
pale
nenuphar
but
dolorous
like
the
peal
of
dooms
and
proclamation
of
the
night
the
waste
returned
that
voice
of
light
with
echo
from
its
hollow
tombs
twilight
on
the
snow
before
the
hill
s
high
altar
bowed
the
trees
are
druids
weird
and
white
facing
the
vision
of
the
light
with
ancient
lips
to
silence
vowed
no
certain
sound
the
woods
aver
nor
motion
save
of
formless
filled
with
faint
twilight
flutterings
with
thronging
gloom
and
and
hidden
in
a
hollow
dell
lie
all
the
winds
that
magic
trees
have
lulled
with
crystal
wizardries
and
bound
about
with
image
calm
as
a
marble
god
who
smiles
colossal
in
the
grim
serenity
of
stone
upon
the
broken
pillars
lying
all
alone
athwart
the
horizon
s
infinite
and
yellow
miles
whom
neither
desert
darkness
nor
the
desert
noon
nor
dawns
that
render
terrible
the
bare
dead
land
nor
winds
that
wrap
his
mighty
form
in
palls
of
sand
nor
the
medusa
of
the
dumb
and
stony
moon
shall
evermore
dismay
nor
lion
nor
the
lynx
with
claws
and
eyes
of
golden
glede
nor
any
griffin
from
the
gates
of
treasure
freed
to
roam
the
gulf
nor
any
wild
and
wandering
sphinx
even
thus
amid
the
waste
of
all
fair
things
that
were
of
high
marmoreal
dreams
immense
and
overthrown
i
wait
forever
and
about
my
face
is
blown
the
sand
of
crumbling
cenotaph
and
sepulcher
the
refuge
of
beauty
from
regions
of
the
sun
s
decay
all
day
the
cruel
rain
strikes
darkly
down
and
from
the
night
thy
fatal
stars
shall
beauty
wilt
thou
abide
this
night
and
day
roofless
at
portals
dark
and
desperate
wilt
thou
a
shelter
unrefused
implore
and
past
the
tomb
s
door
evade
thy
lover
in
eluding
hate
alas
for
what
have
i
to
offer
thee
chill
halls
of
mind
dark
rooms
of
memory
where
thou
shalt
dwell
with
woes
and
thoughts
infirm
this
citadel
of
sense
trembling
before
some
nameless
imminence
and
with
the
glutless
worm
nightmare
as
though
a
thousand
vampires
from
the
day
fleeing
unseen
oppressed
that
nightly
deep
the
straitening
and
darkened
skies
of
sleep
closed
on
the
dreamland
dale
in
which
i
lay
eternal
tensions
numbed
the
wings
of
time
while
through
the
unending
narrow
ways
i
sought
awakening
up
precipitous
gloom
i
thought
to
reach
the
dawn
sublime
rejected
at
the
closen
gates
of
light
i
turned
and
down
new
dreams
and
shadows
fled
where
beetling
shapes
of
veiled
colossal
dread
with
gothic
wings
enormous
arched
the
night
the
mummy
from
out
the
light
of
many
a
mightier
day
from
pharaonic
splendour
memphian
gloom
and
from
the
night
aeonian
of
the
tomb
they
brought
him
forth
to
meet
the
modern
ray
upon
his
brow
the
unbroken
seal
of
clay
while
gods
have
gone
to
a
forgotten
doom
and
desolation
and
the
dust
assume
temple
and
cot
immingling
in
decay
from
out
the
everlasting
womb
sublime
of
cyclopean
death
within
a
land
of
tombs
and
cities
rotting
in
the
sun
he
is
reborn
to
mock
the
might
of
time
while
kings
have
built
against
oblivion
with
walls
and
columns
of
the

sand
forgetfulness
my
life
is
less
than
any
broken
glass
my
long
and
weary
love
thy
lips
all
all
is
turned
to
mere
oblivion
with
the
grey
flowers
and
the
fallen
grass
of
yesteryear
and
on
the
winds
that
pass
thy
music
and
thy
memory
are
one
for
thy
wan
face
desired
above
the
sun
only
some
languid
echo
saith
alas
love
is
no
more
immemorably
flown
as
any
leaf
or
petal
to
me
the
very
fields
are
still
and
strange
and
lone
the
forest
and
the
garden
fail
for
breath
where
the
dumb
heavens
hold
implacably
an
autumn
like
the
marble
sleep
of
death
flamingoes
on
skies
of
tropic
evening
broad
and
above
a
tranquil
sea
of
molten
malachite
with
flare
of
scarlet
wings
in
long
and
level
flight
the
soundless
fleet
flamingoes
pass
to
isles
unseen
they
pass
and
disappear
where
darkening
palms
indent
the
horizon
underneath
some
high
and
tawny
lost
in
the
sunset
gulfs
of
glowing
cinnabar
where
sinks
the
painted
moon
with
prows
of
orpiment
the
chimaera

will
slay
the

chimaera

and
death
have
many
a

despite

though
thy

attain
the
lunar
peaks
of
ice
and

he
some
night
of
agonized
eternity
with
brazen
teeth
shall
gnaw
thy
fretted
brain
gorged
with
the
dust
of
thrones
and
fanes
with
lidless
eyes
like
moons
of
adamant
and
vaulted

emportalling
the

he
crouches
like

sphinx
before
some
temple

moves
to

like

grey
with

yellow
like
an

murmuring
across

ancient
affluence
about
the

of

and

the

of
evening
flee
and
slowly
now
and
solemnly
i
see
the
pomp
of
shadows
pass
often
beneath
some
fervid
moon
with
splendid
spells
i
vainly
strive
dead
loves
imperial
to
revive
and

ah
the

fail
the

fade
to
mist
and

the

of
my

are
dim
the

are
a
crownless
king
who
reigns
alone
i
live
within
this
ashen

where
winds
rebuild
from
wandering

my
columns
and
my
crumbled
throne
requiescat
in
pace

with
the

strew
and

pale

as

that
sleep
in

under

that

with
lulling
foam
the
sealed
extremer
lands
slumber
with
songless
birds
that
sang
and
sang
to
death
giving
their
gladder
breath
to
lonely
winds
in
one
melodious
pang
sleep
with
the
golden
queens
of
planets
long
forgot
whose

are
not

by

with
the

flown
from
ivory
lyre
and

of

string
left
mute
in

desolate
ere
the
dream
of

pass
with
the

sank
in

turned
to

on

with

pale

as
moonlight
on

knowing
the
weariness
of

days
and
nights
the
great
and
grievous
vanity
of
joy
and
pain
frail
loves
that
pass
where
languors
infinite
remain
fervours
and
long
despairs
and
desperate
brief
delights
knowing
how
in
the
witless
brains
of
them
that

the
drowsy
wiving
worm
hath
prospered
and
hath
died
knowing
that
evermore
by

abide
the
standing
glooms
made
stagnant
in
the
sepulchre
knowing
the
vacillant
leaves
that
tremble
flame
and
fall
the
sweetly
wasting

the

and

that
knowing
these
things
the

fain
of

not

the

beyond
the

of

the

circling
some
wild

outmost
in

on
me
this
unfathomed
wish
to
hark
what
central
sea
with
midnight
strewn
plangent
to
what
enormous
plenilune
that
lifts
in
silence
hinderless
and
stark
the
brazen

the

inclusion
of
the

all

is
the
hope

the

a
psalm
to
the
best
beloved
thou
comfortest
me
with
the
manna
of
thy
love
and
the
kisses
of
thy
mouth
are
wine

thy

are
grateful

in
lonely

by
the

grapes
on

that
confront
the
autumnal
desert

apples
that
the

thy

gazed
on
the

thy

a

fed
with
lethean

and
the

of
thy

is
like
to
the
savour
of
lotos
in
thy

is
a
perfume
of
ecstasy
and
a
perfume
of
sleep
between
thy

a

nay
it
is
none

that
i

forevermore
i
seek
the
city
and
the
land
of
my
former
home
in
the
quest
thereof
i
have
wandered
from
the
first
immemorable
years
of
my
youth
till
now
and
have
mingled
the
dust
of
many
realms
of
many
highways
in
my
garments
hem
i
have
seen
the
cities
greater
than
rome
and
the
fanes
more
white
than
the
clouds
of
summer
the
lands
unpeopled
and
unexplored

that
is
thronged
by
the
red
and
monstrous
lilies
even
the
far
aerial
walls
of
the
cities
of
mirage
and
the
saffron
meadows
of
sunset
i
have
seen
but
nevermore
the
city
and
land
of
my
former
where
lieth
the
land
of
thine
home
and
by
what
name
shall
we
know
it
and
distinguish
the
rumour
thereof
among
the
rumours
of
many
lands
alas
i
know
not
where
it
lieth
nor
in
the
broad
black
scrolls
of
geographers
and
the
charts
of
old
seamen
who
have
sailed
to
the
marge
of
the
seventh
sea
is
the
place
thereof
recorded
and
its
name
i
have
never
learned
howbeit
i
have
learned
the
name
of
empires
lying
beneath
stars
to
us
invisible
in
many
languages
have
i
spoken
in
barbarous
tongues
unknown
to
babel
and
i
have
heard
the
speech
of
many
men
even
of
them
that
inhabit
the
strange
isles
of
the
sea
of
fire
and
the
sea
of
snow
thunder
and
lutes
and
the
fine
unceasing
querulousness
of
gnats
and
the
stupendous
moaning
of
the
simoon
lyres
of
ebony
damascened
with
crystal
bells
of
malachite
with
golden
clappers
the
song
of
exotic
birds
that
sigh
like
women
or
sob
like
fountains
whispers
and
shoutings
of
fire
the
multitudinous
mutter
of
cities
asleep
the
manifold
tumult
of
cities
at
dawn
and
the
slow
and
weary
murmur
of
all
have
i
heard
but
never
in
any
place
from
any
tongue
a
sound
or
syllable
that
resembled

from
primeval
time
in
the
garden
of
the
kings
that
rule
an
equatorial
realm
of
the
planet
saturn
with
black
foliage
fine
and
intricate
as
the
web
of
some
enormous
spider
with
petals
of
livid
rose
and
purple
like
the
purple
of
putrefying
flesh
and
a
stem
rising
like
a
swart
and
hairy
wrist
from
a
bulb
so
old
so
encrusted
with
the
growth
of
centuries
that
it
resembles
an
urn
of
stone
the
monstrous
flower
holds
dominion
over
all
the
garden
in
this
flower
from
the
years
of
the
oldest
legend
an
evil
demon
has
demon
whose
name
and
whose
nativity
are
known
to
the
superior
magicians
and
mysteriarchs
of
the
kingdom
but
to
none
other
over
the
flowers
the
ophidian
orchids
that
coil
and
sting
the
lilies
that
open
their
ribbèd
petals
by
night
and
fasten
with
tiny
yellow
teeth
on
the
bodies
of
sleeping
dragonflies
the
carnivorous
cacti
that
yawn
with
green
lips
beneath
their
beards
of
poisonous
yellow
prickles
the
plants
that
palpitate
like
hearts
the
blossoms
that
pant

a
breath
of
venomous
all

supreme
in
its
malign
immortality
and
evil

to
strange
maleficence
fantastic
mischief
even
to
acts
of
rebellion
against
the
gardeners
who
proceed
about
their
duties
with
wariness
and
trepidation
since
more
than
one
of
them
has
been
bitten
even
unto
death
by
some
vicious
and
venefic
flower
in
places
the
garden
has
run
wild
from
lack
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
fearful
gardeners
and
has
become
a
monstrous
tangle
of
serpentine
creepers
and
plants
convolved
and
in
lethal
hate
or
venomous
love
and
horrible
as
a
rout
of
wrangling
vipers
and
pythons
and
like
his
innumerable
ancestors
before
him
the
king
dares
not
destroy
the
flower
for
fear
that
the
devil
driven
from
its
habitation
might
seek
a
new
home

body
of
one
of
the
king
s
even
the
heart
of
his
fairest
and
gentlest
and
most
beloved
queen
images
tears
thy
tears
are
not
as
mine
thou
weepest
as
a
green
fountain
among
palms
and
roses
with
lightly
falling
drops
that
bedew
the
flowery
turf
my
tears
are
like
a
rain
of
marah
in
the
desert
leaving
a
bitter
pool
whose
waters
are
fire
and
poison
the
secret
rose
my
soul
hath
dreamt
of
a
rose
whose
marvellous
and
secret
flower
fraught
with
an
unimaginable
perfume
hath
never
grown
in
any
garden
only
in
valleys
of
the
shifting
cloud
only
among
the
palms
and
fountains
of
a
land
of
mirage
only
in
isles
beyond
the
seas
of
sunset
it
blooms
for
a
moment
and
is
gone
but
ever
the
ghost
of
its
fragrance
haunts
the
hall
of
slumber
and
the
women
whom
i
meet
in
dreams
wear
always
its
blossom
for
coronal
the
wind
and
the
garden
to
thee
my
love
is
something
strange
and
fantastical
and
far
away
like
the
vast
and
desolate
sighing
of
the
desert
wind
to
one
who
dwells
in
a
garden
of
palm
and
rose
and
lotus
filled
by
no
louder
sound
than
the
mellow
lisp
of
a
breeze
of
perfume
or
the
sigh
of
silvering
fountains
offerings
before
thee
o
goddess
of
my
dreams
idol
of
my
desires
i
have
burnt
amber
and
myrrh
frankincense
and
all
the
strange
and
rich
perfumes
of
lands
a
thousand
leagues
beyond
araby
or
taprobane
strange
and
rich
offerings
have
i
brought
thee
the
gems
of
unknown
regions
and
the
spoil
of
cities
remoter
than
caydon
or
samarkand
but
these
delight
thee
not
only
the
flowers
of
spring
and
the
diamonds
and
opals
of
dew
strung
on
the
threads
of
the
spider
a
coronal
the
pale
and
flowerless
poppies
of
proserpine
the
cold
blind
lotus
of
lethe
and
the
strange
white
that
grow
from
the
lips
of
drowned
men
in
the
blue
darkness
of
the
nether
sea
have
i
woven
as
a
coronal
for
my
dead
love
the
black
lake
in
a
land
where
weirdness
and
mystery
had
strongly
leagued
themselves
with
eternal
desolation
the
lake
was
at
an
undiscoverable
date
of
elder
aeons
to
fill
some
fathomless
gulf
far
down
amid
the
shadows
of
snowless
volcanic
mountains
no
eye
not
even
the
sun
s
when
he
stared
vertically
upon
it
for
a
few
hours
at
midday
seemed
able
to
divine
its
depths
of
sullen
blackness
and
unrippled
silence
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
found
a
so
singular
pleasure
in
frequently
contemplating
the
strange
lake
sitting
for
i
knew
not
how
long
on
its
bleak
basaltic
shores
where
grew
but
a
few
fleshly
red
orchids
bent
above
the
waters
like
open
and
thirsty
mouths
i
would
peer
with
countless
fantastic
conjectures
and
shadowy
imaginings
into
the
alluring
mystery
of
its
unknown
and
inexplorable
gulf
it
was
at
an
hour
of
morning
before
the
sun
had
surmounted
the
rough
and
broken
rim
of
the
summits
when
i
first
came
and
clomb
down
through
the
shadows
which
filled
like
some
subtler
fluid
the
volcanic
basin
seen
at
the
bottom
of
that
stirless
tincture
of
air
and
twilight
the
lake
seemed
as
dregs
of
darkness
peering
for
the
first
time
after
the
deep
and
difficult
descent
into
the
so
dull
and
leaden
waters
i
was
at
length
aware
of
certain
small
and
scattered
gleams
of
silver
apparently
far
beneath
the
surface
and
fancying
them
the
metal
in
some
mysterious
ledge
or
the
glints
of
treasure
i
bent
closer
in
my
eagerness
and
finally
perceived
that
what
i
saw
was
but
the
reflection
of
the
stars
which
tho
the
day
was
full
upon
the
mountains
and
the
lands
without
were
yet
visible
in
the
depth
and
darkness
of
that
enshadowed
place
vignettes
beyond
the
mountains
surely
beyond
the
mountains
there
is
the
mountains
that
lie
so
blue
and
still
at
the
world
s
extreme
such
ancient
calm
such
infinite
quietude
is
upon
them
that
surely
no
toiling
cities
no
sea
whose
foam
a
ship
has
ever
cloven
can
lie
beyond
but
valleys
of
azure
silence
where
amaranthine
flowers
sleep
and
dream
untroubled
of
any
wind
by
the
hyalescense
of
tranquilly
flowing
streams
unbroken
as
the
surface
of
a
mirror
the
broken
lute
because
you
are
silent
to
my
lyric
prayers
deaf
to
the
melodies
i
have
made
from
the
sighs
and
murmurs
of
a
wounded
love
i
have
broken
my
golden
lute
and
cast
it
away
tarnished
and
unstrung
among
the
red
leaves
and
faded
roses
of
the
september
garden
silence
the
silver
dust
of
lilies
the
mournful
muted
wind
of
autumn
and
the
fitfully
drifting
leaves
have
claimed
it
for
their
own
seeing
it
there
as
you
pass
on
your
queenly
way
amid
the
crumbling
roses
will
you
not
echo
in
your
heart
one
sigh
of
the
many
sighs
which
as
a
music
for
your
pleasure
were
breathed
from
its
chords
during
the
summer
s
days
nostalgia
of
the
unknown
the
nostalgia
of
things
unknown
of
lands
forgotten
or
unfound
is
upon
me
at
times
often
i
long
for
the
gleam
of
yellow
suns
upon
terraces
of
translucent
azure
marble
mocking
the
windless
waters
of
lakes
unfathomably
calm
for
lost
legendary
palaces
of
serpentine
silver
and
ebony
whose
columns
are
green
stalactites
for
the
pillars
of
fallen
temples
standing
in
the
vast
purpureal
sunset
of
a
land
of
lost
and
marvellous
romance
i
sigh
for
the
depths
of
cedar
forests
through
whose
fantastically
woven
boughs
one
sees
at
intervals
an
unknown
tropic
ocean
like
gleams
of
blue
diamond
for
isles
of
palm
and
coral
that
fret
an
amber
morning
somewhere
beyond
cathay
or
taprobana
for
the
strange
and
hidden
cities
of
the
desert
with
burning
brazen
domes
and
slender
pinnacles
of
gold
and
copper
that
pierce
a
heaven
of
heated
lazuli
grey
sorrow
ofttimes
in
the
golden
sad
november
days
i
meet
among
the
dead
roses
of
the
garden
the
ghost
of
an
old
sorrow
grey
and
dim
as
the
mist
of
a
wandering
mist
that
was
once
a
rain
of
tears
there
through
the
long
decline
of
afternoon
i
walk
among
the
roses
with
the
ghost
of
my
sorrow
whose
form
becomes
dimmer
and
more
indistinct
till
i
know
its
face
no
longer
from
the
twilight
nor
its
voice
from
the
vesper
wind
the
hair
of
circe
i
am
afraid
of
thy
hair
lustrous
heavily
curled
it
suggests
the
coils
of
a
golden
snake
and
half
the
fascination
of
thy
painted
lips
of
thy
still
and
eyes
is
due
to
the
fear
that
it
may
awake
beneath
my
caresses
the
eyes
of
circe
thine
eyes
are
green
and
still
as
the
lakes
of
the
desert
they
awake
in
me
the
thirst
for
strange
and
bitter
mysteries
the
desire
of
secrets
that
are
deadly
and
sterile
a
dream
of
lethe
in
the
quest
of
her
whom
i
had
lost
i
came
at
length
to
the
shores
of
lethe
under
the
vault
of
an
immense
empty
ebon
sky
from
which
all
the
stars
had
vanished
one
by
one
proceeding
i
knew
not
whence
a
pale
elusive
light
as
of
the
waning
moon
or
the
phantasmal
phosphorescence
of
a
dead
sun
lay
dimly
and
without
lustre
on
the
sable
stream
and
on
the
black
flowerless
meadows
by
this
light
i
saw
many
wandering
souls
of
men
and
women
who
came
hesitantly
or
in
haste
to
drink
of
the
slow
unmurmuring
waters
but
among
all
these
there
were
none
who
departed
in
haste
and
many
who
stayed
to
watch
with
unseeing
eyes
the
calm
and
waveless
movement
of
the
stream
at
length
in
the
and
gracile
form
and
the
still
uplifted
face
of
a
woman
who
stood
apart
from
the
rest
i
saw
the
one
whom
i
had
sought
and
hastening
to
her
side
with
a
heart
wherein
old
memories
sang
like
a
nest
of
nightingales
was
fain
to
take
her
by
the
hand
but
in
the
pale
immutable
eyes
and
wan
unmoving
lips
that
were
raised
to
mine
i
saw
no
light
of
memory
nor
any
tremor
of
recognition
and
knowing
now
that
she
had
forgotten
i
turned
away
despairingly
and
finding
the
river
at
my
side
was
suddenly
aware
of
my
ancient
thirst
for
its
waters
a
thirst
i
had
once
thought
to
satisfy
at
many
diverse
springs
but
in
vain
stooping
hastily
i
drank
and
rising
again
perceived
that
the
light
had
died
or
disappeared
and
that
all
the
land
was
like
the
land
of
a
dreamless
slumber
wherein
i
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
faces
of
my
companions
nor
was
i
able
to
remember
any
longer
why
i
had
wished
to
drink
of
the
waters
of
oblivion
the
caravan
my
dreams
are
like
a
caravan
that
departed
long
ago
with
tumult
of
intrepid
banners
and
spears
and
the
clamour
of
bugles
and
brave
adventurous
songs
to
seek
the
horizons
of
perilous
untried
barbaric
lands
and
kingdoms
immense
and
vaguely
rumoured
with
cities
beautiful
and
opulent
as
the
cities
of
paradise
and
deep
edenic
vales
of
palm
and
cinnamon
and
myrrh
lying
beneath
skies
of
primeval
azure
silence
for
traffic
in
the
realms
of
mystery
and
wonder
in
the
marts
of
cities
and
metropoli
a
million
leagues
away
on
the
last
horizon
of
romance
my
dreams
departed
as
a
caravan
with
its
laden
camels
since
then
the
years
are
many
the
days
have
flown
as
the
flocks
of
southering
swallows
unnumbered
moons
have
multiplied
in
fugitive
silver
uncounted
suns
in
irretainable
gold
but
alas
my
dreams
have
not
returned
have
the
swirling
sands
engulfed
them
on
a
noon
of
storm
when
the
desert
rose
like
a
sea
and
rolled
its
tawny
billows
on
the
walled
gardens
of
the
green
and
fragrant
lands
or
perished
they
devoured
by
the
crimson
demons
of
thirst
and
the
ghouls
and
vultures
or
live
they
still
as
captives
in
alien
dungeons
not
to
be
ascertained
or
held
by
a
wizard
spell
in
palaces
and
cities
baroque
and
splendid
as
the
cities
in
a
tale
from
the
thousand
and
one
nights
the
princess
almeena
from
her
balcony
of
pearl
the
princess
almeena
clad
in
a
gown
of
irisated
silk
with
her
long
and
sable
locks
unbound
gazes
toward
the
sea
beyond
a
terrace
of
green
marble
that
peacocks
guard
below
in
the
tinted
light
fantastic
trees
whose
boles
are
serpentine
train
a
fine
and
foliage
mingling
with
the
leaves
of
enormous
lilies
reeds
cluster
about
the
pools
and
fountains
of
black
water
that
are
rimmed
with
carven
malachite
but
these
the
princess
does
not
heed
but
gazes
upon
the
seas
where
the
golden
ichors
of
the
sun
have
gathered
in
a
vast
lake
overflowing
the
horizon
ere
long
a
wind
from
the
west
from
islands
where
palm
trees
blossom
above
the
purple
foam
brings
in
its
breath
the
odour
of
unknown
flowers
to
mingle
with
the
balms
of
the
garden
and
the
sweet
suspiration
of
the
princess
who
dreams
listening
to
the
wind
that
her
lover
the
captain
of
the
emperor
s
most
redoubtable
trireme
of
war
sailing
the
seas
beyond
the
horizon
and
the
sunset
has
remembered
her
wild
and
royal
loveliness
and
has
breathed
in
his
heart
a
secret
sigh
ennui
in
the
alcove
whose
curtains
are
and
whose
pillars
are
fluted
sapphire
reclines
the
emperor
chan
on
his
couch
of
ebony
set
with
opals
and
rubies
and
cushioned
with
the
furs
of
unknown
and
gorgeous
beasts
with
implacable
and
weary
gaze
from
beneath
unmoving
lids
that
seem
carven
of
onyx
he
stares
at
the
crystal
windows
giving
upon
the
infinite
fiery
azures
of
a
tropic
sky
and
sea
oppressive
as
nightmare
a
formless
nameless
fatigue
heavier
than
any
burden
the
slaves
of
the
mines
must
bear
lies
forever
at
his
heart
all
deliriums
of
love
and
wine
the
agonizing
ecstasy
of
drugs
even
the
deepest
and
the
faintest
pulse
of
delight
or
are
proven
all
are
futile
for
the
outworn
but
insatiate
emperor
even
for
a
new
grief
or
a
subtler
pang
than
any
felt
before
he
thinks
lying
on
his
bed
of
ebony
that
he
would
give
the
silver
and
vermilion
of
all
his
mines
with
the
crowded
caskets
the
carcanets
and
crowns
that
lie
in
his
most
immemorial
vainly
with
the
verse
of
the
most
inventive
poets
the
fanciful
fabrics
of
the
subtlest
looms
the
unfamiliar
gems
and
minerals
from
the
uttermost
land
the
pallid
leaves
and
petals
of
a
rare
and
venomous
with
all
these
and
many
stranger
devices
wilder
more
wonderful
diversions
the
slaves
and
sultanas
have
sought
to
alleviate
the
iron
hours
one
by
one
he
has
dismissed
them
with
a
weary
gesture
and
now
in
the
silence
of
the
heavily
curtained
alcove
he
lies
alone
with
the
canker
of
ennui
at
his
heart
like
the
undying
mordant
worm
at
the
heart
of
the
dead
anon
from
between
the
curtains
at
the
head
of
his
couch
a
dark
and
slender
hand
is
slowly
extended
clasping
a
dagger
whose
blade
reflects
the
gold
of
the
curtain
in
a
thin
and
stealthily
wavering
gleam
slowly
in
silence
the
dagger
is
poised
then
rises
and
falls
like
a
splinter
of
lightning
the
emperor
cries
out
as
the
blade
piercing
his
loosely
folded
robe
wounds
him
slightly
in
the
side
in
a
moment
the
alcove
is
filled
with
armed
attendants
who
seize
and
drag
forth
the
slave
girl
the
princess
of
a
conquered
people
who
has
often
but
vainly
implored
her
freedom
from
the
emperor
pale
and
panting
with
terror
and
rage
she
faces
chan
and
the
guardsmen
while
stories
of
unimaginable
monstrous
tortures
of
dooms
unnameable
crowd
upon
her
memory
but
chan
aroused
and
startled
only
for
the
instant
feels
again
the
insuperable
weariness
more
strong
than
anger
or
fear
and
delays
to
give
the
expected
signal
and
then
momentarily
moved
perchance
by
some
ironical
emotion
to
for
the
brief
but
diverting
danger
which
has
served
to
alleviate
his
ennui
for
a
little
he
bids
them
free
the
princess
and
with
a
regal
courtesy
places
about
her
throat
his
own
necklace
of
pearls
and
emeralds
each
of
which
is
the
cost
of
an
army
the
statue
of
silence
i
saw
a
statue
carven
i
knew
not
from
what
substance
nor
with
what
form
or
feature
because
of
the
manifold
drapery
of
black
which
fell
about
it
as
a
veil
or
a
pall
turning
to
psyche
who
was
with
me
i
said
o
thou
who
knowest
by
name
and
form
the
eidola
of
all
things
pray
tell
me
what
thing
is
and
she
answered
the
name
of
it
is
silence
but
neither
god
nor
man
nor
demon
knoweth
the
form
thereof
nor
its
entity
the
seraphim
pause
often
before
it
waiting
the
day
when
the
shape
shall
be
unveiled
and
the
gods
and
demons
of
the
universe
are
mute
in
its
presence
the
time
when
these
lips
shall
speak
and
deliver
forth
one
dreameth
not
what
of
oracle
or
query
or
judgment
or
remoteness
there
are
days
when
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
is
dim
and
strange
when
the
sunlight
about
me
seems
to
fall
on
a
land
remoter
than
the
poles
of
the
moon
the
roses
in
the
garden
surprise
me
like
the
monstrous
orchids
of
unknown
colour
blossoming
in
planets
beyond
aldebaran
and
i
am
startled
by
the
yellow
and
purple
leaves
of
october
as
if
the
veil
of
some
tremendous
and
awful
mystery
were
for
a
moment
in
such
hours
as
these
o
heart
of
my
heart
i
fear
to
touch
thee
i
avoid
thy
caresses
dreading
that
thou
wilt
vanish
as
a
dream
at
dawn
or
that
i
shall
find
thee
a
phantom
the
spectre
of
one
who
died
and
was
forgotten
many
thousand
years
ago
in
a
land
on
which
the
sun
no
longer
shines
the
memnons
of
the
night
ringed
with
a
bronze
horizon
which
at
a
point
immensely
remote
seems
welded
with
the
blue
brilliance
of
a
sky
of
steel
they
oppose
the
black
splendour
of
their
porphyritic
forms
to
the
sun
s
insuperable
gaze
reared
in
the
morning
twilight
of
primeval
time
by
a
race
whose
towering
tombs
and
cities
are
one
with
the
dust
of
their
builders
in
the
slow
lapse
of
the
desert
they
abide
to
face
the
terrible
latter
dawns
that
move
abroad
in
a
starkness
of
fire
consuming
the
veils
of
night
on
the
vast
and
desolations
level
with
the
light
their
tenebrific
brows
preserve
a
pride
as
of
titan
kings
in
their
lidless
implacable
eyes
of
staring
stone
is
the
petrified
despair
of
those
who
have
gazed
too
long
on
the
infinite
mute
as
the
mountains
from
whose
iron
matrix
they
were
hewn
their
mouths
have
never
acknowledged
the
sovereignty
of
the
suns
that
pass
in
triumphal
flame
from
horizon
unto
horizon
of
the
prostrate
land
only
at
eve
when
the
west
is
like
a
brazen
furnace
and
the
mountains
smoulder
like
ruddy
gold
in
the
depth
of
the
heated
at
eve
when
the
east
grows
infinite
and
vague
and
the
shadows
of
the
waste
are
one
with
the
increasing
shadow
of
and
then
only
from
the
sullen
throats
of
stone
a
music
rings
to
the
bronze
strong
a
sombre
music
strange
and
sonorous
like
the
singing
of
black
stars
or
a
litany
of
gods
that
invoke
oblivion
a
music
that
thrills
the
desert
to
its
heart
of
adamant
and
trembles
in
the
granite
of
forgotten
tombs
till
the
last
echoes
of
its
jubilation
terrible
as
the
trumpets
of
doom
are
one
with
the
black
silence
of
infinity
the
garden
and
the
tomb
i
know
a
garden
of
lovely
and
multiform
as
the
orchids
of
far
exotic
the
flowers
of
manifold
petal
whose
colours
change
as
if
by
enchantment
in
the
alter
nation
of
the
triple
suns
flowers
like
tiger
lilies
from
the
garden
of
satan
like
the
paler
lilies
of
paradise
or
the
amaranths
on
whose
perfect
and
immortal
beauty
the
seraphim
so
often
ponder
flowers
fierce
and
splendid
like
the
crimson
or
golden
flowers
of
fire
flowers
bright
and
cold
as
the
crystal
flowers
of
snow
flowers
whereof
there
is
no
likeness
in
any
world
of
any
sun
which
have
no
symbol
in
heaven
or
in
hell
alas
in
the
heart
of
the
garden
is
a
tomb
so
trellised
and
embowered
with
vine
and
blossom
that
the
sunlight
reveals
the
ghastly
gleam
of
its
marble
to
no
careless
or
incurious
scrutiny
but
in
the
night
when
all
the
flowers
are
still
and
their
perfumes
are
faint
as
the
breathing
of
children
in
and
then
only
the
serpents
bred
of
corruption
crawl
from
the
tomb
and
trail
the
fetor
and
phosphorescence
of
their
from
end
to
end
of
the
garden
in
cocaigne
it
was
a
windless
afternoon
of
april
beneath
skies
that
were
tender
as
the
smile
of
love
when
we
went
forth
you
and
i
to
seek
the
fabulous
and
fortunate
realm
of
cocaigne
past
leafing
oaks
with
foliage
of
bronze
and
chrysolite
through
zones
of
yellow
and
white
and
red
and
purple
flowers
like
a
landscape
seen
through
a
prism
we
fared
with
hopeful
and
tremulous
hearts
forgetting
all
save
the
dream
we
had
cherished
at
last
we
came
to
the
lonely
woods
the
pines
with
their
depth
of
balmy
cool
compassionate
shadow
which
are
sacred
to
the
genius
of
that
land
there
for
the
first
time
i
was
bold
to
take
your
hand
in
mine
and
led
you
to
a
slope
where
the
woodland
lilies
with
petals
of
white
and
yellow
ivory
gleamed
among
the
fallen
needles
as
in
a
dream
i
found
that
my
arms
were
about
you
as
in
a
dream
i
kissed
your
yielding
lips
and
the
ardent
pallor
of
your
cheeks
and
throat
motionless
you
clung
to
me
and
a
flush
arose
beneath
my
kisses
like
a
delicate
stain
and
lingered
softly
your
eyes
deepened
to
my
gaze
like
the
brown
pools
of
the
forest
at
evening
and
far
within
them
as
in
immensity
itself
trembled
and
shone
the
steadfast
stars
of
your
love
as
a
ship
that
has
wandered
beneath
stormy
suns
and
disastrous
moons
but
comes
at
last
to
the
arms
of
the
shielding
harbour
my
head
lay
on
the
gentle
heaving
of
your
delicious
breast
and
i
knew
that
we
had
found
cocaigne
the
litany
of
the
seven
kisses
i
i
kiss
thy
hands
whose
fingers
are
delicate
and
pale
as
the
petals
of
the
white
lotus
ii
i
kiss
thy
hair
which
has
the
lustre
of
black
jewels
and
is
darker
than
lethe
flowing
by
midnight
through
the
moonless
slumber
of
lands
iii
i
kiss
thy
brow
which
resembles
the
rising
moon
in
a
valley
of
cedars
iv
i
kiss
thy
cheeks
where
lingers
a
faint
flush
like
the
reflection
of
a
rose
upheld
to
an
urn
of
alabaster
v
i
kiss
thine
eyelids
and
liken
them
to
the
flowers
that
close
beneath
the
oppression
of
a
tropic
evening
in
a
land
where
the
sunsets
are
bright
as
the
flames
of
burning
amber
vi
i
kiss
thy
throat
whose
ardent
pallor
is
the
pallor
of
marble
warmed
by
the
autumn
sun
vii
i
kiss
thy
mouth
which
has
the
savour
and
perfume
of
fruits
agleam
with
spray
from
a
magic
fountain
in
the
secret
paradise
that
we
alone
shall
find
a
paradise
whence
they
that
come
shall
nevermore
depart
for
the
waters
thereof
are
lethe
and
the
fruit
is
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
from
a
letter
you
not
join
me
in
atlantis
where
we
will
go
down
through
streets
of
blue
and
yellow
marble
to
the
wharves
of
orichalch
and
choose
us
a
galley
with
a
golden
eros
for
figurehead
and
sails
of
tyrian
sendal
with
mariners
that
knew
odysseus
and
beautiful
slaves
from
the
of
lemuria
we
will
lift
anchor
for
the
unknown
fortunate
isles
of
the
outer
sea
and
sailing
in
the
wake
of
an
opal
sunset
will
lose
that
ancient
land
in
the
glaucous
twilight
and
see
from
our
couch
of
ivory
and
satin
the
rising
of
unknown
stars
and
perished
planets
perhaps
we
will
not
return
but
will
follow
the
tropic
summer
from
isle
to
halcyon
isle
across
the
amaranthine
seas
of
myth
and
fable
we
will
eat
the
lotos
and
the
fruit
of
lands
whereof
odysseus
never
dreamt
and
drink
the
pallid
wines
of
faery
grown
in
a
vale
of
perpetual
moonlight
i
will
find
for
you
a
necklace
of
pearls
and
a
necklace
of
yellow
rubies
and
crown
you
with
precious
corals
that
have
the
semblance
of
blossoms
we
will
roam
in
the
marts
of
forgotten
cities
of
jasper
and
ports
beyond
cathay
and
i
will
buy
you
a
gown
of
peacock
azure
damascened
with
copper
and
gold
and
vermilion
and
a
gown
of
black
samite
with
runes
of
orange
woven
by
fantastic
sorcery
without
the
touch
of
hands
in
a
dim
land
of
spells
and
philtres
from
the
crypts
of
memory
aeons
of
aeons
ago
in
an
epoch
whose
marvelous
worlds
have
crumbled
and
whose
mighty
suns
are
less
than
shadow
i
dwelt
in
a
star
whose
course
decadent
from
the
high
irremeable
heavens
of
the
past
was
even
then
verging
upon
the
abyss
in
which
said
astronomers
its
immemorial
cycle
should
find
a
dark
and
disastrous
close
ah
strange
was
that
stranger
than
any
dream
of
dreamers
in
the
spheres
of
or
than
any
vision
that
hath
soared
upon
visionaries
in
their
retrospection
of
the
sidereal
past
there
through
cycles
of
a
history
whose
piled
and
records
were
hopeless
of
tabulation
the
dead
had
come
to
outnumber
infinitely
the
living
and
built
of
a
stone
that
was
indestructible
save
in
the
furnace
of
suns
their
cities
rose
beside
those
of
the
living
like
the
prodigious
metropli
of
titans
with
walls
that
overgloom
the
vicinal
villages
and
over
all
was
the
black
funereal
vault
of
the
cryptic
dome
of
infinite
shadows
where
the
dismal
sun
suspended
like
a
sole
enormous
lamp
failed
to
illumine
and
drawing
back
its
fires
from
the
face
of
the
irresolvable
ether
threw
a
baffled
and
despairing
beam
on
the
vague
remote
horizons
and
shrouded
vistas
illimitable
of
the
visionary
land
we
were
a
sombre
secret
who
dwelt
beneath
that
sky
of
eternal
twilight
pierced
by
the
towering
tombs
and
obelisks
of
the
past
in
our
blood
was
the
chill
of
the
ancient
night
of
time
and
our
pulses
flagged
with
a
creeping
prescience
of
the
lentor
of
lethe
over
our
courts
and
fields
like
invisible
sluggish
vampires
born
of
mausoleums
rose
and
hovered
the
black
hours
with
wings
that
distilled
a
malefic
languor
made
from
the
shadowy
woe
and
despair
of
perished
cycles
the
very
skies
were
fraught
with
oppression
and
we
breathed
beneath
them
as
in
a
sepulcher
forever
sealed
with
all
its
stagnancies
of
corruption
and
slow
decay
and
darkness
impenetrable
save
to
the
fretting
worm
vaguely
we
lived
and
loved
as
in
dim
and
mystic
dreams
that
hover
upon
the
verge
of
fathomless
sleep
we
felt
for
our
women
with
their
pale
and
spectral
beauty
the
same
desire
that
the
dead
may
feel
for
the
phantom
lilies
of
hadean
meads
our
days
were
spent
in
roaming
through
the
ruins
of
lone
and
immemorial
cities
whose
palaces
of
fretted
copper
and
streets
that
ran
between
lines
of
carven
golden
obelisks
lay
dim
and
ghastly
with
the
dead
light
or
were
drowned
forever
in
seas
of
stagnant
shadow
cities
whose
vast
and
fanes
preserved
their
gloom
of
primordial
mystery
and
awe
from
which
the
simulacra
of
gods
looked
forth
with
unalterable
eyes
to
the
hopeless
heavens
and
saw
the
ulterior
night
the
ultimate
oblivion
languidly
we
kept
our
gardens
whose
grey
lilies
concealed
a
necromantic
perfume
that
had
power
to
evoke
for
us
the
dead
and
spectral
dreams
of
the
past
or
wandering
through
ashen
fields
of
perennial
autumn
we
sought
the
rare
and
mystic
immorteles
with
sombre
leaves
and
pallid
petals
that
bloomed
beneath
willows
of
wan
and
veil
like
foliage
or
wept
with
a
sweet
and
dew
by
the
flowing
silence
of
acherontic
waters
and
one
by
one
we
died
and
were
lost
in
the
dust
of
accumulated
time
we
knew
the
years
as
a
passing
of
shadows
and
death
itself
as
the
yielding
of
twilight
unto
night
a
phantasy
i
have
dreamt
of
an
unknown
land
remote
in
ulterior
time
and
alien
space
not
ascertainable
the
desert
of
a
past
upon
which
has
settled
the
bleak
irrevocable
silence
of
infinitude
where
all
is
ruined
save
the
stone
of
tombs
and
cenotaphs
and
where
the
sole
peoples
are
the
kingless
uncounted
tribes
of
the
subterranean
dead
above
this
land
of
my
dream
citied
with
tombs
and
cenotaphs
a
red
and
smouldering
sun
maintains
a
spectral
day
in
alternation
with
an
ashen
moon
through
the
black
ether
where
the
stars
have
long
since
perished
and
through
the
hush
of
the
consummation
of
time
above
the
riven
monuments
and
crumbled
records
of
alien
history
flit
in
the
final
twilight
the
mysterious
wings
of
seraphim
sent
to
fulfill
ineffable
errands
or
confer
with
demons
of
the
abyss
and
black
gigantic
angels
newly
returned
from
missions
of
destruction
pause
amid
the
sepulchers
to
sift
from
their
gloomy
and
tremendous
vans
the
pale
ashes
of
annihilated
stars
the
demon
the
angel
and
beauty
of
the
demon
who
standeth
or
walketh
always
with
me
at
my
left
hand
i
asked
hast
thou
seen
beauty
her
that
was
the
mistress
of
my
soul
in
eternity
her
that
is
now
beyond
question
set
over
me
in
time
even
though
i
behold
her
not
and
it
may
be
have
never
beheld
nor
ever
shall
her
of
whose
aspect
i
am
ignorant
as
noon
is
concerning
any
star
her
of
whom
as
witness
and
testimony
i
have
found
only
the
hem
of
her
shadow
or
at
most
her
reflection
in
a
dim
and
troubled
water
answer
if
thou
canst
and
tell
me
is
she
like
pearls
or
like
stars
does
she
resemble
most
the
sunlight
that
is
transparent
and
unbroken
or
the
sunlight
divided
into
splendour
and
iris
is
she
the
heart
of
the
day
or
the
soul
of
the
night
to
which
the
demon
answered
after
as
i
thought
a
brief
space
of
meditation
concerning
this
beauty
i
can
tell
thee
but
little
beyond
that
which
thou
knowest
albeit
in
those
orbs
to
which
the
demons
of
my
rank
have
admission
there
be
greater
adumbrations
of
some
transcendent
mystery
than
here
yet
have
i
never
seen
that
mystery
itself
and
know
not
if
it
be
male
or
female
aeons
ago
when
i
was
young
and
incautious
when
the
world
was
new
and
bright
and
there
were
more
stars
than
now
i
too
was
attracted
by
this
mystery
and
sought
after
it
in
all
accessible
spheres
but
failing
to
find
the
thing
itself
i
soon
grew
weary
of
embracing
its
shadows
and
took
to
the
pursuit
of
illusions
less
insubstantial
now
i
am
become
grey
and
ashen
without
and
red
like
old
fire
within
who
was
fiery
and
all
through
back
in
the
aeons
of
which
i
speak
heed
me
for
i
am
as
wise
and
wary
and
ancient
as
the
and
sun
and
i
am
become
of
the
opinion
that
the
thing
beauty
itself
does
not
exist
doubtless
the
semblance
thereof
is
but
a
web
of
shadow
and
delusion
woven
by
the
crafty
hand
of
god
that
he
may
snare
demons
and
men
therewith
for
his
mirth
and
the
laughter
of
his
the
demon
ceased
and
took
to
watching
me
as
and
with
one
eye
that
is
more
red
than
aldebaran
and
inscrutable
as
the
gulfs
beyond
the
hyades
then
of
the
angel
who
walketh
or
standeth
always
with
me
at
my
right
hand
i
asked
hast
thou
seen
beauty
or
hast
thou
heard
any
assured
rumour
concerning
beauty
to
which
the
angel
answered
after
as
i
thought
a
moment
of
hesitation
as
to
this
beauty
i
can
tell
thee
but
little
beyond
that
which
thou
knowest
albeit
in
all
the
heavens
this
mystery
is
a
topic
of
the
most
frequent
and
sublime
speculation
among
the
archangels
and
a
perennial
theme
for
the
more
inspired
singers
and
harpists
of
the
despite
all
this
we
are
greatly
ignorant
as
to
its
true
nature
and
substance
and
attributes
but
sometimes
there
are
mighty
adumbrations
which
cover
even
the
superior
seraphim
from
above
their
and
make
unfamiliar
twilight
in
heaven
and
sometimes
there
is
an
echo
which
fills
the
empyrean
and
hushes
the
archangelic
harps
in
the
midst
of
their
praising
of
god
this
is
not
often
and
these
visitations
of
echo
and
shadow
spread
an
awe
over
the
assembled
thrones
and
splendours
and
dominations
which
at
other
times
accompanies
only
the
emanence
or
appearance
of
god
himself
thus
are
we
assured
as
to
the
reality
of
this
beauty
and
because
it
remains
a
mystery
to
us
to
whom
naught
else
is
mysterious
except
god
we
conjecture
that
it
is
the
thing
upon
which
god
meditateth
and
centred
and
because
of
which
he
hath
held
himself
immanifest
to
us
for
so
many
aeons
that
this
is
the
secret
which
god
keepeth
even
from
the
the
shadows
there
were
many
shadows
in
the
palace
of
augusthes
about
the
silver
throne
that
had
blackened
beneath
the
invisible
passing
of
ages
they
fell
from
pillar
and
broken
roof
and
fretted
window
in
multiformity
seeming
the
black
fantastic
spectres
of
doom
and
desolation
they
moved
through
the
palace
in
a
gradual
grave
and
imperceptible
dance
whose
music
was
the
change
and
motion
of
suns
and
moons
they
were
long
and
slender
like
all
other
shadows
before
the
early
light
and
behind
the
declining
sun
squat
and
intense
beneath
the
desert
noontide
and
faint
with
the
withered
moon
and
in
the
interlunar
darkness
they
were
as
myriad
tongues
hidden
behind
the
shut
and
silent
lips
of
night
one
came
daily
to
that
place
of
shadows
and
desolation
and
sate
upon
the
silver
throne
watching
the
shadows
that
were
of
desolation
king
nor
slave
disputed
him
there
in
the
palace
whose
kings
and
whose
slaves
were
powerless
alike
in
the
intangible
dungeon
of
centuries
the
tombs
of
unnumbered
and
forgotten
monarchs
were
white
upon
the
yellow
desert
roundabout
some
had
partly
rotted
away
and
showed
like
the
sunken
of
a
and
lidless
beneath
the
staring
heavens
others
still
retained
the
undesecrated
seal
of
death
and
were
as
the
closed
eyes
of
one
lately
dead
but
he
who
watched
the
shadows
from
the
silver
throne
heeded
not
these
nor
the
fleet
wind
that
dipt
to
the
broken
tombs
and
emerged
shrilly
its
unseen
hands
dark
with
the
dust
of
kings
he
was
a
philosopher
from
what
land
there
was
none
to
know
or
ask
nor
was
there
any
to
ask
what
knowledge
or
delight
he
sought
in
the
ruined
palace
with
eyes
alway
upon
the
moving
shadows
nor
what
were
the
thoughts
that
moved
through
his
mind
in
ghostly
unison
with
them
his
eyes
were
old
and
sad
with
meditation
and
wisdom
and
his
beard
was
long
and
white
upon
his
long
white
robe
for
many
days
he
came
with
the
dawn
and
departed
with
sunset
and
his
shadow
leaned
from
the
shadow
of
the
throne
and
moved
with
the
others
but
one
eve
he
departed
not
and
thereafter
his
shadow
was
one
with
the
shadow
of
the
silver
throne
death
found
and
left
him
there
where
he
dwindled
into
dust
that
was
as
the
dust
of
slaves
or
kings
but
the
ebb
and
refluence
of
shadows
went
on
in
the
days
that
were
before
the
end
ere
the
aged
world
astray
with
the
sun
in
strange
heavens
should
be
lost
in
the
cosmic
darkness
or
under
the
influence
of
other
and
conflicting
gravitations
should
crumble
apart
and
bare
its
granite
bones
to
the
light
of
strange
suns
and
the
granite
too
should
dissolve
and
be
as
of
the
dust
of
slaves
and
kings
noon
was
encircled
with
darkness
and
the
depths
of
were
chasmed
with
sunlight
change
there
was
none
other
than
this
for
the
earth
was
dead
and
stirred
not
to
the
tottering
feet
of
time
and
in
the
expectant
silence
before
the
twilight
of
the
sun
the
moving
shadows
seemed
but
a
mockery
of
change
a
meaningless
antic
phantasmagoria
of
things
that
were
an
afterfiguring
of
forgotten
time
and
now
the
sun
was
darkened
slowly
in
as
by
some
vast
and
invisible
bulk
and
twilight
hushed
the
shadows
in
the
palace
of
augusthes
as
the
world
itself
swung
down
toward
the
long
and
single
shadow
of
irretrievable
oblivion
