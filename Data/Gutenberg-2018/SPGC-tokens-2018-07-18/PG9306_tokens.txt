at

introduction
there
are
always
americas
to
be
discovered
the
most
interesting
in
europe
i
can
lay
no
claim
to
having
discovered
an
america
but
i
do
claim
to
have
discovered
a
columbus
his
name
is
benedetto
croce
and
he
dwells
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
at
naples
city
of

america
can
not
be
expressed
in
geographical
terms
it
is
more
important
than
any
space
of
mountain
and
river
of
forest
and
dale
it
belongs
to
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
and
has
many
provinces
that
province
which
most
interests
me
i
have
striven
in
the
following
pages
to
annex
to
the
possessions
of
the
race
an
act
which
can
not
be
blamed
as
predatory
since
it
may
be
said
of
philosophy
more
truly
than
of
love
that
to
divide
is
not
to
take
away
the
historical
summary
will
show
how
many
a
brave
adventurer
has
navigated
the
perilous
seas
of
speculation
upon
art
how
marvellous
insight
gave
him
glimpses
of
its
beauty
how
plato
threw
away
its
golden
fruit
how
baumgarten
sounded
the
depth
of
its
waters
kant
sailed
along
its
coast
without
landing
and
vico
hoisted
the
italian
flag
upon
its
shore
but
benedetto
croce
has
been
the
first
thoroughly
to
explore
it
cutting
his
way
inland
through
the
tangled
undergrowth
of
imperfect
thought
he
has
measured
its
length
and
breadth
marked
out
and
described
its
spiritual
features
with
minute
accuracy
the
country
thus
won
to
philosophy
will
always
bear
his
name
di
a
new
america
it
was
at
naples
in
the
winter
of
that
i
first
saw
the
philosopher
of
aesthetic
benedetto
croce
although
born
in
the
abruzzi
province
of
aquila
is
essentially
a
neapolitan
and
rarely
remains
long
absent
from
the
city
on
the
shore
of
that
magical
sea
where
once
ulysses
sailed
and
where
sometimes
yet
near
amalfi
we
may
hear
the
syrens
sing
their
song
but
more
wonderful
than
the
song
of
any
syren
seems
to
me
the
theory
of
aesthetic
as
the
science
of
expression
and
that
is
why
i
have
overcome
the
obstacles
that
stood
between
me
and
the
giving
of
this
theory
which
in
my
belief
is
the
truth
to
the
world
no
one
could
have
been
further
removed
than
myself
as
i
turned
over
at
naples
the
pages
of
from
any
idea
that
i
was
nearing
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
art
all
my
youth
it
had
haunted
me
as
an
undergraduate
at
oxford
i
had
caught
the
exquisite
cadence
of
walter
pater
speech
as
it
came
from
his
very
lips
or
rose
like
the
perfume
of
some
exotic
flower
from
the
ribbed
pages
of
the
seeming
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
sphinx
he
solved
it
not
only
delighted
with
pure
pleasure
of
poetry
and
of
subtle
thought
as
he
led
one
along
the
pathways
of
his
enchanted
garden
where
i
shall
always
love
to
tread
oscar
wilde
too
i
had
often
heard
at
his
best
the
most
brilliant
talker
of
our
time
his
wit
flashing
in
the
spring
sunlight
of
oxford
as
now
in
his
beautiful
writings
like
the
jewelled
rapier
of
mercutio
but
his
works
too
will
be
searched
in
vain
by
the
seeker
after
definite
aesthetic
truth
with
swinburne
i
had
sat
and
watched
the
lava
that
yet
flowed
from
those
lips
that
were
kissed
in
youth
by
all
the
muses
neither
from
him
nor
from
whistler
brilliant
aphorisms
on
art
could
be
gathered
anything
more
than
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
the
moment
the
of
the
great
pedagogues
i
had
known
but
never
sat
at
the
feet
of
jowett
whom
i
found
far
less
inspiring
than
any
of
the
great
men
above
mentioned
among
the
dead
i
had
studied
herbert
spencer
and
matthew
arnold
schopenhauer
nietzsche
and
guyau
i
had
conversed
with
that
living
anatole
france
the
modern
rousseau
and
had
enjoyed
the
marvellous
irony
and
eloquence
of
his
writings
which
while
they
delight
the
society
in
which
he
lives
may
well
be
one
of
the
causes
that
lead
to
its
eventual
destruction
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
aesthetic
is
not
in
the
gift
of
the
muses
to
return
to
naples
as
i
looked
over
those
pages
of
the
bound
volumes
of
i
soon
became
aware
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
mind
far
above
the
ordinary
level
of
literary
criticism
the
profound
studies
of
carducci
of
and
of
pascoli
to
name
but
three
in
which
those
writers
passed
before
me
in
all
their
strength
and
in
all
their
weakness
led
me
to
devote
several
days
to
the
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
was
convinced
that
i
had
made
a
discovery
and
wrote
to
the
philosopher
who
owns
and
edits
that
journal
in
response
to
his
invitation
i
made
my
way
on
a
sunny
day
in
november
past
the
little
shops
of
the
that
surround
like
a
necklace
the
rione
de
la
bellezza
and
wound
zigzag
along
the
toledo
i
knew
that
signor
croce
lived
in
the
old
part
of
the
town
but
had
hardly
anticipated
so
remarkable
a
change
as
i
experienced
on
passing
beneath
the
great
archway
and
finding
myself
in
old
naples
this
has
already
been
described
elsewhere
and
i
will
not
here
dilate
upon
this
world
within
a
world
having
so
much
of
greater
interest
to
tell
in
a
brief
space
i
will
merely
say
that
the
costumes
here
seemed
more
picturesque
the
dark
eyes
flashed
more
dangerously
than
elsewhere
there
was
a
quaint
life
an
animation
about
the
streets
different
from
anything
i
had
known
before
as
i
climbed
the
lofty
stone
steps
of
the
palazzo
to
the
floor
where
dwells
the
philosopher
of
aesthetic
i
felt
as
though
i
had
stumbled
into
the
eighteenth
century
and
were
calling
on
giambattista
vico
after
a
brief
inspection
by
a
young
man
with
the
appearance
of
a
secretary
i
was
told
that
i
was
expected
and
admitted
into
a
small
room
opening
out
of
the
hall
thence
after
a
few
moments
waiting
i
was
led
into
a
much
larger
room
the
walls
were
lined
all
round
with
bookcases
barred
and
numbered
filled
with
volumes
forming
part
of
the
philosopher
great
library
i
had
not
long
to
wait
a
door
opened
behind
me
on
my
left
and
a
rather
short
man
advanced
to
greet
me
and
pronouncing
my
name
at
the
same
time
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
asked
me
to
be
seated
beside
him
after
the
interchange
of
a
few
brief
formulae
of
politeness
in
french
our
conversation
was
carried
on
in
italian
and
i
had
a
better
opportunity
of
studying
my
host
air
and
manner
his
hands
he
held
clasped
before
him
but
frequently
released
them
to
make
those
vivid
gestures
with
which
neapolitans
frequently
clinch
their
phrase
his
most
remarkable
feature
was
his
eyes
of
a
greenish
grey
extraordinary
eyes
not
for
beauty
but
for
their
fathomless
depth
and
for
the
sympathy
which
one
felt
welling
up
in
them
from
the
soul
beneath
this
was
especially
noticeable
as
our
conversation
fell
upon
the
question
of
art
and
upon
the
many
problems
bound
up
with
it
i
do
not
know
how
long
that
first
interview
lasted
but
it
seemed
a
few
minutes
only
during
which
was
displayed
before
me
a
vast
panorama
of
unknown
height
and
headland
of
league
upon
league
of
forest
with
its
birds
of
thought
flying
from
tree
to
tree
down
the
long
avenues
into
the
dim
blue
vistas
of
the
unknown
i
returned
with
my
brain
awhirl
as
though
i
had
been
in
fairyland
and
when
i
looked
at
the
second
edition
of
the
with
his
inscription
i
was
sure
of
it
these
lines
will
suffice
to
show
how
the
translation
of
the
originated
from
the
acquaintance
thus
formed
which
has
developed
into
friendship
i
will
now
make
brief
mention
of
benedetto
croce

work
especially
in
so
far
as
it
throws
light
upon
the
for
this
purpose
besides
articles
in
italian
and
german
reviews
i
have
made
use
of
the
excellent
monograph
on
the
philosopher
by
g
prezzolini
first
then
it
will
be
well
to
point
out
that
the
forms
part
of
a
complete
philosophical
system
to
which
the
author
gives
the
general
title
of
philosophy
of
the
spirit
the
is
the
first
of
the
three
volumes
the
second
is
the
the
third
the
of
the
in
the
as
elsewhere
in
the
system
croce
combats
that
false
conception
by
which
natural
science
in
the
shape
of
psychology
makes
claim
to
philosophy
and
formal
logic
to
absolute
value
the
thesis
of
the
can
not
be
discussed
here
it
is
connected
with
the
logic
of
evolution
as
discovered
by
hegel
and
is
the
only
logic
which
contains
in
itself
the
interpretation
and
the
continuity
of
reality
bergson
in
his
deals
with
logic
in
a
somewhat
similar
manner
i
recently
heard
him
lecture
on
the
distinction
between
spirit
and
matter
at
the
collège
de
france
and
those
who
read
french
and
italian
will
find
that
both
croce
and
the
book
above
mentioned
by
the
french
philosopher
will
amply
repay
their
labour
the
conception
of
nature
as
something
lying
outside
the
spirit
which
informs
it
as
the
which
aspires
to
being
underlies
all
thought
and
we
find
constant
reference
to
it
throughout
his
philosophical
system
with
regard
to
the
third
volume
the
of
the
it
is
impossible
here
to
give
more
than
a
hint
of
its
treasures
i
merely
refer
in
passing
to
the
treatment
of
the
will
which
is
posited
as
a
unity
from
the
volitional
for
croce
there
is
no
difference
between
action
and
intention
means
and
end
they
are
one
thing
inseparable
as
the
of
aesthetic
the
of
the
is
a
logic
and
science
of
the
will
not
a
normative
science
just
as
in
aesthetic
the
individuality
of
expression
made
models
and
rules
impossible
so
in
practical
life
the
individuality
of
action
removes
the
possibility
of
catalogues
of
virtues
of
the
exact
application
of
laws
of
the
existence
of
practical
judgments
and
judgments
of
value
to
the
reader
will
probably
ask
here
but
what
then
becomes
of
morality
the
question
will
be
found
answered
in
the
of
and
i
will
merely
say
here
that
croce
thesis
of
the
of
the
practical
activity
economic
and
moral
is
one
of
the
greatest
contributions
to
modern
thought
just
as
it
is
proved
in
the
of
that
the
depends
upon
the
which
is
the
first
degree
the
primary
and
indispensable
thing
so
it
is
proved
in
the
of
the
that
or
depends
upon
which
is
the
degree
of
the
practical
activity
the
volitional
act
is
but
true
freedom
of
the
will
exists
and
consists
in
conforming
not
merely
to
economic
but
to
moral
conditions
to
the
human
spirit
which
is
greater
than
any
individual
here
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
ethics
of
christianity
to
which
croce
accords
all
honour
this
philosophy
of
the
spirit
is
symptomatic
of
the
happy
reaction
of
the
twentieth
century
against
the
crude
materialism
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
it
is
the
spirit
which
gives
to
the
work
of
art
its
value
not
this
or
that
method
of
arrangement
this
or
that
tint
or
cadence
which
can
always
be
copied
by
skilful
plagiarists
not
so
the
of
the
creator
in
england
we
hear
too
much
of
natural
science
which
has
usurped
the
very
name
of
philosophy
the
natural
sciences
are
very
well
in
their
place
but
discoveries
such
as
aviation
are
of
infinitely
less
importance
to
the
race
than
the
smallest
addition
to
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
empirical
science
with
the
collusion
of
positivism
has
stolen
the
cloak
of
philosophy
and
must
be
made
to
give
it
back
among
croce
other
important
contributions
to
thought
must
be
mentioned
his
definition
of
history
as
being
aesthetic
and
differing
from
art
solely
in
that
history
represents
the
art
the
in
connection
with
this
definition
and
its
proof
the
philosopher
recounts
how
he
used
to
hold
an
opposite
view
doing
everything
thoroughly
he
had
prepared
and
written
out
a
long
disquisition
on
this
thesis
which
was
already
in
type
when
suddenly
from
the
midst
of
his
meditations
truth
flashed
upon
he
saw
for
the
first
time
clearly
that
history
can
not
be
a
science
since
like
art
it
always
deals
with
the
particular
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
hastened
to
the
printers
and
bade
them
break
up
the
type
this
incident
is
illustrative
of
the
sincerity
and
good
faith
of
benedetto
croce
one
knows
him
to
be
severe
for
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
others
merciless
for
his
own
yet
though
severe
the
editor
of
is
uncompromisingly
just
and
would
never
allow
personal
dislike
or
jealousy
or
any
extrinsic
consideration
to
stand
in
the
way
of
fair
treatment
to
the
writer
concerned
many
superficial
english
critics
might
benefit
considerably
by
attention
to
this
quality
in
one
who
is
in
other
respects
also
so
immeasurably
their
superior
a
good
instance
of
this
impartiality
is
his
critique
of
schopenhauer
with
whose
system
he
is
in
complete
disagreement
yet
affords
him
full
credit
for
what
of
truth
is
contained
in
his
voluminous
writings
croce
education
was
largely
completed
in
germany
and
on
account
of
their
thoroughness
he
has
always
been
an
upholder
of
german
methods
one
of
his
complaints
against
the
italian
positivists
is
that
they
only
read
works
in
french
or
at
the
most
the
dilettante
booklets
published
in
such
profusion
by
the
press
this
tendency
towards
german
thought
especially
in
philosophy
depends
upon
the
fact
of
the
former
undoubted
supremacy
of
germany
in
that
field
but
croce
does
not
for
a
moment
admit
the
inferiority
of
the
races
and
adds
with
homely
humour
in
reference
to
germany
that
we
must
not
throw
away
the
baby
with
the
close
arduous
study
and
clear
thought
are
the
only
key
to
scientific
philosophical
truth
and
croce
never
begins
an
article
for
a
newspaper
without
the
complete
collection
of
the
works
of
the
author
to
be
criticized
and
his
own
elaborate
notes
on
the
table
before
him
schopenhauer
said
there
were
three
kinds
of
writers
those
who
write
without
thinking
the
great
majority
those
who
think
while
they
write
not
very
numerous
those
who
write
after
they
have
thought
very
rare
croce
certainly
belongs
to
the
last
division
and
as
i
have
said
always
feeds
his
thought
upon
complete
erudition
the
bibliography
of
the
works
consulted
for
the
alone
as
printed
at
the
end
of
the
italian
edition
extends
to
many
pages
and
contains
references
to
works
in
any
way
dealing
with
the
subject
in
all
the
european
languages
for
instance
croce
has
studied
bosanquet
eclectic
works
on
aesthetic
largely
based
upon
german
sources
and
by
no
means
without
value
but
he
takes
exception
to
bosanquet
statement
that
has
consulted
all
works
of
importance
on
the
subject
of
aesthetic
as
a
matter
of
fact
bosanquet
reveals
his
ignorance
of
the
greater
part
of
the
contribution
to
aesthetic
made
by
the
races
which
the
reader
of
this
book
will
recognize
as
of
importance
this
thoroughness
it
is
which
gives
such
importance
to
the
literary
and
philosophical
criticisms
of
croce
method
is
always
historical
and
his
object
in
approaching
any
work
of
art
is
to
classify
the
spirit
of
its
author
as
expressed
in
that
work
there
are
he
maintains
but
two
things
to
be
considered
in
criticizing
a
book
these
are
what
is
its
in
what
way
is
it
singular
how
is
it
differentiated
from
other
works
what
is
its
degree
of
purity
that
is
to
what
extent
has
its
author
kept
himself
free
from
all
considerations
alien
to
the
perfection
of
the
work
as
an
expression
as
a
lyrical
intuition
with
the
answering
of
these
questions
croce
is
satisfied
he
does
not
care
to
know
if
the
author
keep
a
like
maeterlinck
or
prefer
to
walk
on
putney
heath
like
swinburne
this
amounts
to
saying
that
all
works
of
art
must
be
judged
by
their
own
standard
how
far
has
the
author
succeeded
in
doing
what
he
intended
croce
is
far
above
any
personal
animus
although
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
those
he
criticizes
these
like
whose
limitations
he
points
out
his
egoism
his
lack
of
human
sympathy
are
often
very
bitter
and
accuse
the
penetrating
critic
of
want
of
courtesy
this
seriousness
of
purpose
runs
like
a
golden
thread
through
all
work
the
flimsy
superficial
remarks
on
poetry
and
fiction
which
too
often
pass
for
criticism
in
england
scotland
is
a
good
deal
more
thorough
are
put
to
shame
by
the
study
of
which
i
commend
to
all
readers
who
read
or
wish
to
read
italian
they
will
find
in
its
back
numbers
a
complete
picture
of
a
century
of
italian
literature
besides
a
of
philosophical
criticism
the
and
are
our
only
journals
which
can
be
compared
to
and
they
are
less
exhaustive
on
the
philosophical
side
we
should
have
to
add
to
these
and
the
to
get
even
an
approximation
to
the
scope
of
the
italian
review
as
regards
croce
general
philosophical
position
it
is
important
to
understand
that
he
is
a
hegelian
in
the
sense
of
being
a
close
follower
of
that
philosopher
one
of
his
last
works
is
that
in
which
he
deals
in
a
masterly
manner
with
the
philosophy
of
hegel
the
title
may
be
translated
what
is
living
and
what
is
dead
of
the
philosophy
of
hegel
here
he
explains
to
us
the
hegelian
system
more
clearly
than
that
wondrous
edifice
was
ever
before
explained
and
we
realize
at
the
same
time
that
croce
is
quite
as
independent
of
hegel
as
of
kant
of
vico
as
of
spinoza
of
course
he
has
made
use
of
the
best
of
hegel
just
as
every
thinker
makes
use
of
his
predecessors
and
is
in
his
turn
made
use
of
by
those
that
follow
him
but
it
is
incorrect
to
accuse
of
hegelianism
the
author
of
an
of
a
where
hegel
is
only
half
accepted
and
of
a
of
the
which
contains
hardly
a
trace
of
hegel
i
give
an
instance
if
the
great
conquest
of
hegel
be
the
dialectic
of
opposites
his
great
mistake
lies
in
the
confusion
of
opposites
with
things
which
are
distinct
but
not
opposite
if
says
croce
we
take
as
an
example
the
application
of
the
hegelian
triad
that
formulates
becoming
affirmation
negation
and
synthesis
we
find
it
applicable
for
those
opposites
which
are
true
and
false
good
and
evil
being
and
but
to
things
which
are
distinct
but
not
opposite
such
as
art
and
philosophy
beauty
and
truth
the
useful
and
the
moral
these
confusions
led
hegel
to
talk
of
the
death
of
art
to
conceive
as
possible
a
philosophy
of
history
and
to
the
application
of
the
natural
sciences
to
the
absurd
task
of
constructing
a
philosophy
of
nature
croce
has
cleared
away
these
difficulties
by
shewing
that
if
from
the
meeting
of
opposites
must
arise
a
superior
synthesis
such
a
synthesis
can
not
arise
from
things
which
are
distinct
not
since
the
former
are
connected
together
as
superior
and
inferior
and
the
inferior
can
exist
without
the
superior
but
vice
thus
we
see
how
philosophy
can
not
exist
without
art
while
art
occupying
the
lower
place
can
and
does
exist
without
philosophy
this
brief
example
reveals
croce
independence
in
dealing
with
hegelian
problems
i
know
of
no
philosopher
more
generous
than
croce
in
praise
and
elucidation
of
other
workers
in
the
same
field
past
and
present
for
instance
and
apart
from
hegel
has
to
thank
him
for
drawing
attention
to
the
marvellous
excellence
of
the
of
generally
neglected
in
favour
of
the
critiques
of
reason
and
of
practical
for
drawing
the
attention
of
the
world
to
his
obscure
name
and
for
reprinting
his
latin
thesis
in
which
the
word
occurs
for
the
first
time
and
for
the
tributes
paid
to
his
neglected
genius
in
the
history
of
aesthetic
too
is
full
of
generous
appreciation
of
contemporaries
by
croce
and
by
that
profound
thinker
gentile
but
it
is
not
only
philosophers
who
have
reason
to
be
grateful
to
croce
for
his
untiring
zeal
and
diligence
historians
economists
poets
actors
and
writers
of
fiction
have
been
rescued
from
their
undeserved
limbo
by
this
valiant
red
cross
knight
and
now
shine
with
due
brilliance
in
the
circle
of
their
peers
it
must
also
be
admitted
that
a
large
number
of
false
lights
popular
will
o
the
wisps
have
been
ruthlessly
extinguished
with
the
same
breath
for
instance
karl
marx
the
socialist
theorist
and
agitator
finds
in
croce
an
exponent
of
his
views
in
so
far
as
they
are
based
upon
the
truth
but
where
he
blunders
his
critic
immediately
reveals
the
origin
and
nature
of
his
mistakes
croce
studies
in
economic
are
chiefly
represented
by
his
work
the
title
of
which
may
be
translated
historical
materialism
and
marxist
economic
to
indicate
the
breadth
and
variety
of
croce
work
i
will
mention
the
further
monograph
on
the
sixteenth
century
neapolitan
pulcinella
the
original
of
our
punch
and
the
personage
of
the
neapolitan
in
comedy
a
monument
of
erudition
and
of
acute
and
of
lively
dramatic
criticism
that
would
alone
have
occupied
an
ordinary
man
activity
for
half
a
lifetime
one
must
remember
however
that
croce
average
working
day
is
of
ten
hours
his
interest
is
concentrated
on
things
of
the
mind
and
although
he
sits
on
several
royal
commissions
such
as
those
of
the
archives
of
all
italy
and
of
the
monument
to
king
victor
emmanuel
he
has
taken
no
university
degree
and
much
dislikes
any
affectation
of
academic
superiority
he
is
ready
to
meet
any
one
on
equal
terms
and
try
with
them
to
get
at
the
truth
on
any
subject
be
it
historical
literary
or
philosophical
truth
he
says
is
democratic
and
i
can
testify
that
the
search
for
it
in
his
company
is
very
stimulating
as
is
well
said
by
prezzolini
he
has
a
new
word
for
all
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
great
value
of
croce
work
as
an
and
if
we
are
to
judge
of
a
philosophical
system
by
its
action
on
others
then
we
must
place
the
of
the
very
high
it
may
be
said
with
perfect
truth
that
since
the
death
of
the
poet
carducci
there
has
been
no
influence
in
italy
to
compare
with
that
of
benedetto
croce
his
dislike
of
academies
and
of
all
forms
of
prejudice
runs
parallel
with
his
breadth
and
sympathy
with
all
forms
of
thought
his
activity
in
the
present
is
only
equalled
by
his
reverence
for
the
past
naples
he
loves
with
the
blind
love
of
the
child
for
its
parent
and
he
has
been
of
notable
assistance
to
such
neapolitan
talent
as
is
manifested
in
the
works
of
salvatore
di
giacomo
whose
best
poems
are
written
in
the
dialect
of
naples
or
rather
in
a
dialect
of
his
own
which
croce
had
difficulty
in
persuading
the
author
always
to
retain
the
original
jet
of
inspiration
having
been
in
dialect
it
is
clear
that
to
amend
this
inspiration
at
the
suggestion
of
wiseacres
at
the
café
would
have
been
to
ruin
it
altogether
of
the
popularity
that
his
system
and
teaching
have
already
attained
we
may
judge
by
the
fact
that
the
despite
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
is
already
in
its
third
edition
in
italy
where
owing
to
its
influence
philosophy
sells
better
than
fiction
while
the
french
and
germans
not
to
mention
the
czechs
have
long
had
translations
of
the
earlier
editions
his
is
on
the
point
of
appearing
in
its
second
edition
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
of
the
will
eventually
equal
these
works
in
popularity
importance
and
value
of
italian
thought
have
been
too
long
neglected
in
great
where
as
in
benedetto
croce
we
get
the
clarity
of
vision
of
the
latin
joined
to
the
thoroughness
and
erudition
of
the
best
german
tradition
we
have
a
combination
of
rare
power
and
effectiveness
which
can
by
no
means
be
neglected
the
philosopher
feels
that
he
has
a
great
mission
which
is
nothing
less
than
the
leading
back
of
thought
to
belief
in
the
spirit
deserted
by
so
many
for
crude
empiricism
and
positivism
his
view
of
philosophy
is
that
it
sums
up
all
the
higher
human
activities
including
religion
and
that
in
proper
hands
it
is
able
to
solve
any
problem
but
there
is
no
finality
about
problems
the
solution
of
one
leads
to
the
posing
of
another
and
so
on
man
is
the
maker
of
life
and
his
spirit
ever
proceeds
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
perfection
connected
with
this
view
of
life
is
croce
dislike
of
modernism
when
once
a
problem
has
been
correctly
solved
it
is
absurd
to
return
to
the
same
problem
roman
catholicism
can
not
march
with
the
times
it
can
only
exist
by
being
conservative
its
only
logic
is
to
be
illogical
therefore
croce
is
opposed
to
loisy
and
and
supports
the
encyclical
against
modernism
the
catholic
religion
with
its
great
stores
of
myth
and
morality
which
for
many
centuries
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
is
still
there
for
those
who
are
unable
to
assimilate
other
food
another
instance
of
his
dislike
for
modernism
is
his
criticism
of
pascoli
whose
attempts
to
reveal
enigmas
in
the
writings
of
dante
he
looks
upon
as
useless
we
do
not
he
says
read
dante
in
the
twentieth
century
for
his
hidden
meanings
but
for
his
revealed
poetry
i
believe
that
croce
will
one
day
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
very
few
great
teachers
of
humanity
at
present
he
is
not
appreciated
at
nearly
his
full
value
one
rises
from
a
study
of
his
philosophy
with
a
sense
of
having
been
all
the
time
as
it
were
in
personal
touch
with
the
truth
which
is
very
far
from
the
case
after
the
perusal
of
certain
other
philosophies
croce
has
been
called
the
and
if
we
take
philosophy
as
novalis
understood
it
certainly
croce
does
belong
to
the
poets
though
not
to
the
formal
category
of
those
who
write
in
verse
croce
is
at
any
rate
a
born
philosopher
and
as
every
trade
tends
to
make
its
object
prosaic
so
does
every
vocation
tend
to
make
it
poetic
yet
no
one
has
toiled
more
earnestly
than
croce
thorough
might
well
be
his
motto
and
if
he
is
admitted
to
be
a
classic
without
the
stiffness
one
connects
with
that
term
be
sure
he
has
well
merited
the
designation
his
name
stands
for
the
best
that
italy
has
to
give
the
world
of
serious
stimulating
thought
i
know
nothing
to
equal
it
elsewhere
secure
in
his
strength
croce
will
often
introduce
a
joke
or
some
amusing
illustration
from
contemporary
life
in
the
midst
of
a
most
profound
and
serious
argument
this
spirit
of
mirth
is
a
sign
of
superiority
he
who
is
not
sure
of
himself
can
spare
no
energy
for
the
making
of
mirth
croce
loves
to
laugh
at
his
enemies
and
with
his
friends
so
the
philosopher
of
naples
sits
by
the
blue
gulf
and
explains
the
universe
to
those
who
have
ears
to
hear
one
can
philosophize
anywhere
he
says
but
he
remains
significantly
at
naples
thus
i
conclude
these
brief
remarks
upon
the
author
of
the
confident
that
those
who
give
time
and
attention
to
its
study
will
be
grateful
for
having
placed
in
their

i
intuition
and
expression
sidenote
human
knowledge
has
two
forms
it
is
either
intuitive
knowledge
or
logical
knowledge
knowledge
obtained
through
the
imagination
or
knowledge
obtained
through
the
intellect
knowledge
of
the
individual
or
knowledge
of
the
universal
of
individual
things
or
of
the
relations
between
them
it
is
in
fact
productive
either
of
images
or
of
concepts
in
ordinary
life
constant
appeal
is
made
to
intuitive
knowledge
it
is
said
to
be
impossible
to
give
expression
to
certain
truths
that
they
are
not
demonstrable
by
syllogisms
that
they
must
be
learnt
intuitively
the
politician
finds
fault
with
the
abstract
reasoner
who
is
without
a
lively
knowledge
of
actual
conditions
the
pedagogue
insists
upon
the
necessity
of
developing
the
intuitive
faculty
in
the
pupil
before
everything
else
the
critic
in
judging
a
work
of
art
makes
it
a
point
of
honour
to
set
aside
theory
and
abstractions
and
to
judge
it
by
direct
intuition
the
practical
man
professes
to
live
rather
by
intuition
than
by
reason
but
this
ample
acknowledgment
granted
to
intuitive
knowledge
in
ordinary
life
does
not
meet
with
an
equal
and
adequate
acknowledgment
in
the
field
of
theory
and
of
philosophy
there
exists
a
very
ancient
science
of
intellective
knowledge
admitted
by
all
without
discussion
namely
logic
but
a
science
of
intuitive
knowledge
is
timidly
and
with
difficulty
admitted
by
but
a
few
logical
knowledge
has
appropriated
the
lion
share
and
if
she
does
not
quite
slay
and
devour
her
companion
yet
yields
to
her
with
difficulty
the
humble
little
place
of
maidservant
or
doorkeeper
what
it
says
is
intuitive
knowledge
without
the
light
of
intellective
knowledge
it
is
a
servant
without
a
master
and
though
a
master
find
a
servant
useful
the
master
is
a
necessity
to
the
servant
since
he
enables
him
to
gain
his
livelihood
intuition
is
blind
intellect
lends
her
eyes
sidenote
independence
in
respect
to
intellective
now
the
first
point
to
be
firmly
fixed
in
the
mind
is
that
intuitive
knowledge
has
no
need
of
a
master
nor
to
lean
upon
any
one
she
does
not
need
to
borrow
the
eyes
of
others
for
she
has
most
excellent
eyes
of
her
own
doubtless
it
is
possible
to
find
concepts
mingled
with
intuitions
but
in
many
other
intuitions
there
is
no
trace
of
such
a
mixture
which
proves
that
it
is
not
necessary
the
impression
of
a
moonlight
scene
by
a
painter
the
outline
of
a
country
drawn
by
a
cartographer
a
musical
motive
tender
or
energetic
the
words
of
a
sighing
lyric
or
those
with
which
we
ask
command
and
lament
in
ordinary
life
may
well
all
be
intuitive
facts
without
a
shadow
of
intellective
relation
but
think
what
one
may
of
these
instances
and
admitting
further
that
one
may
maintain
that
the
greater
part
of
the
intuitions
of
civilized
man
are
impregnated
with
concepts
there
yet
remains
to
be
observed
something
more
important
and
more
conclusive
those
concepts
which
are
found
mingled
and
fused
with
the
intuitions
are
no
longer
concepts
in
so
far
as
they
are
really
mingled
and
fused
for
they
have
lost
all
independence
and
autonomy
they
have
been
concepts
but
they
have
now
become
simple
elements
of
intuition
the
philosophical
maxims
placed
in
the
mouth
of
a
personage
of
tragedy
or
of
comedy
perform
there
the
function
not
of
concepts
but
of
characteristics
of
such
personage
in
the
same
way
as
the
red
in
a
painted
figure
does
not
there
represent
the
red
colour
of
the
physicists
but
is
a
characteristic
element
of
the
portrait
the
whole
it
is
that
determines
the
quality
of
the
parts
a
work
of
art
may
be
full
of
philosophical
concepts
it
may
contain
them
in
greater
abundance
and
they
may
be
there
even
more
profound
than
in
a
philosophical
dissertation
which
in
its
turn
may
be
rich
to
overflowing
with
descriptions
and
intuitions
but
notwithstanding
all
these
concepts
it
may
contain
the
result
of
the
work
of
art
is
an
intuition
and
notwithstanding
all
those
intuitions
the
result
of
the
philosophical
dissertation
is
a
concept
the
contains
copious
ethical
observations
and
distinctions
but
it
does
not
for
that
reason
lose
in
its
total
effect
its
character
of
simple
story
of
intuition
in
like
manner
the
anecdotes
and
satirical
effusions
which
may
be
found
in
the
works
of
a
philosopher
like
schopenhauer
do
not
remove
from
those
works
their
character
of
intellective
treatises
the
difference
between
a
scientific
work
and
a
work
of
art
that
is
between
an
intellective
fact
and
an
intuitive
fact
lies
in
the
result
in
the
diverse
effect
aimed
at
by
their
respective
authors
this
it
is
that
determines
and
rules
over
the
several
parts
of
each
sidenote
and
but
to
admit
the
independence
of
intuition
as
regards
concept
does
not
suffice
to
give
a
true
and
precise
idea
of
intuition
another
error
arises
among
those
who
recognize
this
or
who
at
any
rate
do
not
make
intuition
explicitly
dependent
upon
the
intellect
this
error
obscures
and
confounds
the
real
nature
of
intuition
by
intuition
is
frequently
understood
the
or
knowledge
of
actual
reality
the
apprehension
of
something
as
certainly
perception
is
intuition
the
perception
of
the
room
in
which
i
am
writing
of
the
and
paper
that
are
before
me
of
the
pen
i
am
using
of
the
objects
that
i
touch
and
make
use
of
as
instruments
of
my
person
which
if
it
write
therefore
exists
these
are
all
intuitions
but
the
image
that
is
now
passing
through
my
brain
of
a
me
writing
in
another
room
in
another
town
with
different
paper
pen
and
ink
is
also
an
intuition
this
means
that
the
distinction
between
reality
and
is
extraneous
secondary
to
the
true
nature
of
intuition
if
we
assume
the
existence
of
a
human
mind
which
should
have
intuitions
for
the
first
time
it
would
seem
that
it
could
have
intuitions
of
effective
reality
only
that
is
to
say
that
it
could
have
perceptions
of
nothing
but
the
real
but
if
the
knowledge
of
reality
be
based
upon
the
distinction
between
real
images
and
unreal
images
and
if
this
distinction
does
not
originally
exist
these
intuitions
would
in
truth
not
be
intuitions
either
of
the
real
or
of
the
unreal
but
pure
intuitions
where
all
is
real
nothing
is
real
the
child
with
its
difficulty
of
distinguishing
true
from
false
history
from
fable
which
are
all
one
to
childhood
can
furnish
us
with
a
sort
of
very
vague
and
only
remotely
approximate
idea
of
this
ingenuous
state
intuition
is
the
indifferentiated
unity
of
the
perception
of
the
real
and
of
the
simple
image
of
the
possible
in
our
intuitions
we
do
not
oppose
ourselves
to
external
reality
as
empirical
beings
but
we
simply
objectify
our
impressions
whatever
they
be
sidenote
and
the
concepts
of
space
and
those
therefore
who
look
upon
intuition
as
sensation
formed
and
arranged
simply
according
to
the
categories
of
space
and
time
would
seem
to
approximate
more
nearly
to
the
truth
space
and
time
they
say
are
the
forms
of
intuition
to
have
intuitions
is
to
place
in
space
and
in
temporal
sequence
intuitive
activity
would
then
consist
in
this
double
and
concurrent
function
of
spatiality
and
temporality
but
for
these
two
categories
must
be
repeated
what
was
said
of
intellectual
distinctions
found
mingled
with
intuitions
we
have
intuitions
without
space
and
without
time
a
tint
of
sky
and
a
tint
of
sentiment
an
ah
of
pain
and
an
effort
of
will
objectified
in
consciousness
these
are
intuitions
which
we
possess
and
with
their
making
space
and
time
have
nothing
to
do
in
some
intuitions
spatiality
may
be
found
without
temporality
in
others
this
without
that
and
even
where
both
are
found
they
are
perceived
by
posterior
reflexion
they
can
be
fused
with
the
intuition
in
like
manner
with
all
its
other
elements
that
is
they
are
in
it
and
not
as
ingredients
and
not
as
essentials
who
without
a
similar
act
of
interruptive
reflexion
is
conscious
of
temporal
sequence
while
listening
to
a
story
or
a
piece
of
music
that
which
intuition
reveals
in
a
work
of
art
is
not
space
and
time
but
character
individual
physiognomy
several
attempts
may
be
noted
in
modern
philosophy
which
confirm
the
view
here
exposed
space
and
time
far
from
being
very
simple
and
primitive
functions
are
shown
to
be
intellectual
constructions
of
great
complexity
and
further
even
in
some
of
those
who
do
not
altogether
deny
to
space
and
time
the
quality
of
forming
or
of
categories
and
functions
one
may
observe
the
attempt
to
unify
and
to
understand
them
in
a
different
manner
from
that
generally
maintained
in
respect
of
these
categories
some
reduce
intuition
to
the
unique
category
of
spatiality
maintaining
that
time
also
can
only
be
conceived
in
terms
of
space
others
abandon
the
three
dimensions
of
space
as
not
philosophically
necessary
and
conceive
the
function
of
spatiality
as
void
of
every
particular
spatial
determination
but
what
could
such
a
spatial
function
be
that
should
control
even
time
may
it
not
be
a
residuum
of
criticisms
and
of
negations
from
which
arises
merely
the
necessity
to
posit
a
generic
intuitive
activity
and
is
not
this
last
truly
determined
when
one
unique
function
is
attributed
to
it
not
spatializing
nor
temporalizing
but
characterizing
or
better
when
this
is
conceived
as
itself
a
category
or
function
which
gives
knowledge
of
things
in
their
concretion
and
individuality
sidenote
and
having
thus
freed
intuitive
knowledge
from
any
suggestion
of
intellectualism
and
from
every
posterior
and
external
adjunct
we
must
now
make
clear
and
determine
its
limits
from
another
side
and
from
a
different
kind
of
invasion
and
confusion
on
the
other
side
and
before
the
inferior
boundary
is
sensation
formless
matter
which
the
spirit
can
never
apprehend
in
itself
in
so
far
as
it
is
mere
matter
this
it
can
only
possess
with
form
and
in
form
but
postulates
its
concept
as
precisely
a
limit
matter
in
its
abstraction
is
mechanism
passivity
it
is
what
the
spirit
of
man
experiences
but
does
not
produce
without
it
no
human
knowledge
and
activity
is
possible
but
mere
matter
produces
animality
whatever
is
brutal
and
impulsive
in
man
not
the
spiritual
dominion
which
is
humanity
how
often
do
we
strive
to
understand
clearly
what
is
passing
within
us
we
do
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
but
this
does
not
appear
to
the
mind
as
objectified
and
formed
in
such
moments
it
is
that
we
best
perceive
the
profound
difference
between
matter
and
form
these
are
not
two
acts
of
ours
face
to
face
with
one
another
but
we
assault
and
carry
off
the
one
that
is
outside
us
while
that
within
us
tends
to
absorb
and
make
its
own
that
without
matter
attacked
and
conquered
by
form
gives
place
to
concrete
form
it
is
the
matter
the
content
that
differentiates
one
of
our
intuitions
from
another
form
is
constant
it
is
spiritual
activity
while
matter
is
changeable
without
matter
however
our
spiritual
activity
would
not
leave
its
abstraction
to
become
concrete
and
real
this
or
that
spiritual
content
this
or
that
definite
intuition
it
is
a
curious
fact
characteristic
of
our
times
that
this
very
form
this
very
activity
of
the
spirit
which
is
essentially
ourselves
is
so
easily
ignored
or
denied
some
confound
the
spiritual
activity
of
man
with
the
metaphorical
and
mythological
activity
of
nature
which
is
mechanism
and
has
no
resemblance
to
human
activity
save
when
we
imagine
with
aesop
that
loquuntur
non
tantum
some
even
affirm
that
they
have
never
observed
in
themselves
this
miraculous
activity
as
though
there
were
no
difference
or
only
one
of
quantity
between
sweating
and
thinking
feeling
cold
and
the
energy
of
the
will
others
certainly
with
greater
reason
desire
to
unify
activity
and
mechanism
in
a
more
general
concept
though
admitting
that
they
are
specifically
distinct
let
us
however
refrain
for
the
moment
from
examining
if
such
a
unification
be
possible
and
in
what
sense
but
admitting
that
the
attempt
may
be
made
it
is
clear
that
to
unify
two
concepts
in
a
third
implies
a
difference
between
the
two
first
and
here
it
is
this
difference
that
is
of
importance
and
we
set
it
in
relief
sidenote
and
intuition
has
often
been
confounded
with
simple
sensation
but
since
this
confusion
is
too
shocking
to
good
sense
it
has
more
frequently
been
attenuated
or
concealed
with
a
phraseology
which
seems
to
wish
to
confuse
and
to
distinguish
them
at
the
same
time
thus
it
has
been
asserted
that
intuition
is
sensation
but
not
so
much
simple
sensation
as
of
sensations
the
equivoque
arises
precisely
from
the
word
association
association
is
understood
either
as
memory
mnemonic
association
conscious
recollection
and
in
that
case
is
evident
the
absurdity
of
wishing
to
join
together
in
memory
elements
which
are
not
intuified
distinguished
possessed
in
some
way
by
the
spirit
and
produced
by
consciousness
or
it
is
understood
as
association
of
unconscious
elements
in
this
case
we
remain
in
the
world
of
sensation
and
of
nature
further
if
with
certain
associationists
we
speak
of
an
association
which
is
neither
memory
nor
flux
of
sensations
but
is
a
association
formative
constructive
distinguishing
then
we
admit
the
thing
itself
and
deny
only
its
name
in
truth
productive
association
is
no
longer
association
in
the
sense
of
the
sensualists
but
that
is
to
say
spiritual
activity
synthesis
may
be
called
association
but
with
the
concept
of
productivity
is
already
posited
the
distinction
between
passivity
and
activity
between
sensation
and
intuition
sidenote
and
other
psychologists
are
disposed
to
distinguish
from
sensation
something
which
is
sensation
no
longer
but
is
not
yet
intellective
concept
representation
or
what
is
the
difference
between
their
representation
or
image
and
our
intuitive
knowledge
the
greatest
and
none
at
all
representation
too
is
a
very
equivocal
word
if
by
representation
be
understood
something
detached
and
standing
out
from
the
psychic
base
of
the
sensations
then
representation
is
intuition
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
conceived
as
a
complex
sensation
a
return
is
made
to
simple
sensation
which
does
not
change
its
quality
according
to
its
richness
or
poverty
operating
alike
in
a
rudimentary
or
in
a
developed
organism
full
of
traces
of
past
sensations
nor
is
the
equivoque
remedied
by
defining
representation
as
a
psychic
product
of
secondary
order
in
relation
to
sensation
which
should
occupy
the
first
place
what
does
secondary
order
mean
here
does
it
mean
a
qualitative
a
formal
difference
if
so
we
agree
representation
is
elaboration
of
sensation
it
is
intuition
or
does
it
mean
greater
complexity
and
complication
a
quantitative
material
difference
in
that
case
intuition
would
be
again
confused
with
simple
sensation
sidenote
and
and
yet
there
is
a
sure
method
of
distinguishing
true
intuition
true
representation
from
that
which
is
inferior
to
it
the
spiritual
fact
from
the
mechanical
passive
natural
fact
every
true
intuition
or
representation
is
also
that
which
does
not
objectify
itself
in
expression
is
not
intuition
or
representation
but
sensation
and
naturality
the
spirit
does
not
obtain
intuitions
otherwise
than
by
making
forming
expressing
he
who
separates
intuition
from
expression
never
succeeds
in
reuniting
them
activity
possesses
intuitions
to
the
extent
that
it
expresses
should
this
expression
seem
at
first
paradoxical
that
is
chiefly
because
as
a
general
rule
a
too
restricted
meaning
is
given
to
the
word
expression
it
is
generally
thought
of
as
restricted
to
verbal
expression
but
there
exist
also
expressions
such
as
those
of
line
colour
and
sound
to
all
of
these
must
be
extended
our
affirmation
the
intuition
and
expression
together
of
a
painter
are
pictorial
those
of
a
poet
are
verbal
but
be
it
pictorial
or
verbal
or
musical
or
whatever
else
it
be
called
to
no
intuition
can
expression
be
wanting
because
it
is
an
inseparable
part
of
intuition
how
can
we
possess
a
true
intuition
of
a
geometrical
figure
unless
we
possess
so
accurate
an
image
of
it
as
to
be
able
to
trace
it
immediately
upon
paper
or
on
a
slate
how
can
we
have
an
intuition
of
the
contour
of
a
region
for
example
of
the
island
of
sicily
if
we
are
not
able
to
draw
it
as
it
is
in
all
its
meanderings
every
one
can
experience
the
internal
illumination
which
follows
upon
his
success
in
formulating
to
himself
his
impressions
and
sentiments
but
only
so
far
as
he
is
able
to
formulate
them
sentiments
or
impressions
then
pass
by
means
of
words
from
the
obscure
region
of
the
soul
into
the
clarity
of
the
contemplative
spirit
in
this
cognitive
process
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
intuition
from
expression
the
one
is
produced
with
the
other
at
the
same
instant
because
they
are
not
two
but
one
sidenote
as
to
their
the
principal
reason
which
makes
our
theme
appear
paradoxical
as
we
maintain
it
is
the
illusion
or
prejudice
that
we
possess
a
more
complete
intuition
of
reality
than
we
really
do
one
often
hears
people
say
that
they
have
in
their
minds
many
important
thoughts
but
that
they
are
not
able
to
express
them
in
truth
if
they
really
had
them
they
would
have
coined
them
into
beautiful
ringing
words
and
thus
expressed
them
if
these
thoughts
seem
to
vanish
or
to
become
scarce
and
poor
in
the
act
of
expressing
them
either
they
did
not
exist
or
they
really
were
scarce
and
poor
people
think
that
all
of
us
ordinary
men
imagine
and
have
intuitions
of
countries
figures
and
scenes
like
painters
of
bodies
like
sculptors
save
that
painters
and
sculptors
know
how
to
paint
and
to
sculpture
those
images
while
we
possess
them
only
within
our
souls
they
believe
that
anyone
could
have
imagined
a
madonna
of
raphael
but
that
raphael
was
raphael
owing
to
his
technical
ability
in
putting
the
madonna
upon
the
canvas
nothing
can
be
more
false
than
this
view
the
world
of
which
as
a
rule
we
have
intuitions
is
a
small
thing
it
consists
of
little
expressions
which
gradually
become
greater
and
more
ample
with
the
increasing
spiritual
concentration
of
certain
moments
these
are
the
sort
of
words
which
we
speak
within
ourselves
the
judgments
that
we
tacitly
express
here
is
a
man
here
is
a
horse
this
is
heavy
this
is
hard
this
pleases
me
etc
it
is
a
medley
of
light
and
colour
which
could
not
pictorially
attain
to
any
more
sincere
expression
than
a
haphazard
splash
of
colours
from
among
which
would
with
difficulty
stand
out
a
few
special
distinctive
traits
this
and
nothing
else
is
what
we
possess
in
our
ordinary
life
this
is
the
basis
of
our
ordinary
action
it
is
the
index
of
a
book
the
labels
tied
to
things
take
the
place
of
the
things
themselves
this
index
and
labels
which
are
themselves
expressions
suffice
for
our
small
needs
and
small
actions
from
time
to
time
we
pass
from
the
index
to
the
book
from
the
label
to
the
thing
or
from
the
slight
to
the
greater
intuitions
and
from
these
to
the
greatest
and
most
lofty
this
passage
is
sometimes
far
from
being
easy
it
has
been
observed
by
those
who
have
best
studied
the
psychology
of
artists
that
when
after
having
given
a
rapid
glance
at
anyone
they
attempt
to
obtain
a
true
intuition
of
him
in
order
for
example
to
paint
his
portrait
then
this
ordinary
vision
that
seemed
so
precise
so
lively
reveals
itself
as
little
better
than
nothing
what
remains
is
found
to
be
at
the
most
some
superficial
trait
which
would
not
even
suffice
for
a
caricature
the
person
to
be
painted
stands
before
the
artist
like
a
world
to
discover
michael

with

but
with

brain
leonardo
shocked
the
prior
of
the
convent
delle
grazie
by
standing
for
days
together
opposite
the
last
supper
without
touching
it
with
the
brush
he
remarked
of
this
attitude
that
men
of
the
most
lofty
genius
when
they
are
doing
the
least
work
are
then
the
most
active
seeking
invention
with
their
minds
the
painter
is
a
painter
because
he
sees
what
others
only
feel
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
but
do
not
see
we
think
we
see
a
smile
but
in
reality
we
have
only
a
vague
impression
of
it
we
do
not
perceive
all
the
characteristic
traits
from
which
it
results
as
the
painter
perceives
them
after
his
internal
meditations
which
thus
enable
him
to
fix
them
on
the
canvas
even
in
the
case
of
our
intimate
friend
who
is
with
us
every
day
and
at
all
hours
we
do
not
possess
intuitively
more
than
at
the
most
certain
traits
of
his
physiognomy
which
enable
us
to
distinguish
him
from
others
the
illusion
is
less
easy
as
regards
musical
expression
because
it
would
seem
strange
to
everyone
to
say
that
the
composer
had
added
or
attached
notes
to
the
motive
which
is
already
in
the
mind
of
him
who
is
not
the
composer
as
if
ninth
symphony
were
not
his
own
intuition
and
his
own
intuition
the
ninth
symphony
thus
just
as
he
who
is
deceived
as
to
his
material
wealth
is
confuted
by
arithmetic
which
states
its
exact
amount
so
is
he
confuted
who
nourishes
delusions
as
to
the
wealth
of
his
own
thoughts
and
images
he
is
brought
back
to
reality
when
he
is
obliged
to
cross
the
bridge
of
asses
of
expression
we
say
to
the
former
count
to
the
latter
speak
here
is
a
pencil
draw
express
yourself
we
have
each
of
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
little
of
the
poet
of
the
sculptor
of
the
musician
of
the
painter
of
the
prose
writer
but
how
little
as
compared
with
those
who
are
so
called
precisely
because
of
the
lofty
degree
in
which
they
possess
the
most
universal
dispositions
and
energies
of
human
nature
how
little
does
a
painter
possess
of
the
intuitions
of
a
poet
how
little
does
one
painter
possess
those
of
another
painter
nevertheless
that
little
is
all
our
actual
patrimony
of
intuitions
or
representations
beyond
these
are
only
impressions
sensations
feelings
impulses
emotions
or
whatever
else
one
may
term
what
is
outside
the
spirit
not
assimilated
by
man
postulated
for
the
convenience
of
exposition
but
effectively
inexistent
if
existence
be
also
a
spiritual
fact
sidenote
of
intuition
and
we
may
then
add
this
to
the
verbal
variants
descriptive
of
intuition
noted
at
the
beginning
intuitive
knowledge
is
expressive
knowledge
independent
and
autonomous
in
respect
to
intellectual
function
indifferent
to
discriminations
posterior
and
empirical
to
reality
and
to
unreality
to
formations
and
perceptions
of
space
and
time
even
when
posterior
intuition
or
representation
is
distinguished
as
form
from
what
is
felt
and
suffered
from
the
flux
or
wave
of
sensation
or
from
psychic
material
and
this
form
this
taking
possession
of
is
expression
to
have
an
intuition
is
to
express
it
is
nothing
else
nothing
more
but
nothing
less
than
ii
intuition
and
art
sidenote
and
before
proceeding
further
it
seems
opportune
to
draw
certain
consequences
from
what
has
been
established
and
to
add
some
explanation
sidenote
of
art
and
intuitive
we
have
frankly
identified
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
with
the
aesthetic
or
artistic
fact
taking
works
of
art
as
examples
of
intuitive
knowledge
and
attributing
to
them
the
characteristics
of
intuition
and
but
our
identification
is
combated
by
the
view
held
even
by
many
philosophers
who
consider
art
to
be
an
intuition
of
an
altogether
special
sort
let
us
admit
they
say
that
art
is
intuition
but
intuition
is
not
always
art
artistic
intuition
is
of
a
distinct
species
differing
from
intuition
in
general
by
something
sidenote
specific
but
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
indicate
of
what
this
something
more
consists
it
has
sometimes
been
thought
that
art
is
not
a
simple
intuition
but
an
intuition
of
an
intuition
in
the
same
way
as
the
concept
of
science
has
been
defined
not
as
the
ordinary
concept
but
as
the
concept
of
a
concept
thus
man
should
attain
to
art
by
objectifying
not
his
sensations
as
happens
with
ordinary
intuition
but
intuition
itself
but
this
process
of
raising
to
a
second
power
does
not
exist
and
the
comparison
of
it
with
the
ordinary
and
scientific
concept
does
not
imply
what
is
wished
for
the
good
reason
that
it
is
not
true
that
the
scientific
concept
is
the
concept
of
a
concept
if
this
comparison
imply
anything
it
implies
just
the
opposite
the
ordinary
concept
if
it
be
really
a
concept
and
not
a
simple
representation
is
a
perfect
concept
however
poor
and
limited
science
substitutes
concepts
for
representations
it
adds
and
substitutes
other
concepts
larger
and
more
comprehensive
for
those
that
are
poor
and
limited
it
is
ever
discovering
new
relations
but
its
method
does
not
differ
from
that
by
which
is
formed
the
smallest
universal
in
the
brain
of
the
humblest
of
men
what
is
generally
called
art
by
antonomasia
collects
intuitions
that
are
wider
and
more
complex
than
those
which
we
generally
experience
but
these
intuitions
are
always
of
sensations
and
impressions
art
is
the
expression
of
impressions
not
the
expression
of
expressions
sidenote
difference
of
for
the
same
reason
it
can
not
be
admitted
that
intuition
which
is
generally
called
artistic
differs
from
ordinary
intuition
as
to
intensity
this
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
to
operate
differently
on
the
same
matter
but
since
artistic
function
is
more
widely
distributed
in
different
fields
but
yet
does
not
differ
in
method
from
ordinary
intuition
the
difference
between
the
one
and
the
other
is
not
intensive
but
extensive
the
intuition
of
the
simplest
popular
which
says
the
same
thing
or
very
nearly
as
a
declaration
of
love
such
as
issues
at
every
moment
from
the
lips
of
thousands
of
ordinary
men
may
be
intensively
perfect
in
its
poor
simplicity
although
it
be
extensively
so
much
more
limited
than
the
complex
intuition
of
a
by
leopardi
sidenote
difference
is
extensive
and
the
whole
difference
then
is
quantitative
and
as
such
indifferent
to
philosophy
certain
men
have
a
greater
aptitude
a
more
frequent
inclination
fully
to
express
certain
complex
states
of
the
soul
these
men
are
known
in
ordinary
language
as
artists
some
very
complicated
and
difficult
expressions
are
more
rarely
achieved
and
these
are
called
works
of
art
the
limits
of
the
expressions
and
intuitions
that
are
called
art
as
opposed
to
those
that
are
vulgarly
called
are
empirical
and
impossible
to
define
if
an
epigram
be
art
why
not
a
single
word
if
a
story
why
not
the
occasional
note
of
the
journalist
if
a
landscape
why
not
a
topographical
sketch
the
teacher
of
philosophy
in
molière
comedy
was
right
whenever
we
speak
we
create
prose
but
there
will
always
be
scholars
like
monsieur
jourdain
astonished
at
having
created
prose
for
forty
years
without
knowing
it
and
who
will
have
difficulty
in
persuading
themselves
that
when
they
call
their
servant
john
to
bring
their
slippers
they
have
spoken
nothing
less
than
prose
we
must
hold
firmly
to
our
identification
because
among
the
principal
reasons
which
have
prevented
aesthetic
the
science
of
art
from
revealing
the
true
nature
of
art
its
real
roots
in
human
nature
has
been
its
separation
from
the
general
spiritual
life
the
having
made
of
it
a
sort
of
special
function
or
aristocratic
circle
no
one
is
astonished
when
he
learns
from
physiology
that
every
cellule
is
an
organism
and
every
organism
a
cellule
or
synthesis
of
cellules
no
one
is
astonished
at
finding
in
a
lofty
mountain
the
same
chemical
elements
that
compose
a
small
stone
or
fragment
there
is
not
one
physiology
of
small
animals
and
one
of
large
animals
nor
is
there
a
special
chemical
theory
of
stones
as
distinct
from
mountains
in
the
same
way
there
is
not
a
science
of
lesser
intuition
distinct
from
a
science
of
greater
intuition
nor
one
of
ordinary
intuition
distinct
from
artistic
intuition
there
is
but
one
aesthetic
the
science
of
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
which
is
the
aesthetic
or
artistic
fact
and
this
aesthetic
is
the
true
analogy
of
logic
logic
includes
as
facts
of
the
same
nature
the
formation
of
the
smallest
and
most
ordinary
concept
and
the
most
complicated
scientific
and
philosophical
system
sidenote
nor
can
we
admit
that
the
word
or
artistic
genius
as
distinct
from
the
of
the
ordinary
man
possesses
more
than
a
quantitative
signification
great
artists
are
said
to
reveal
us
to
ourselves
but
how
could
this
be
possible
unless
there
be
identity
of
nature
between
their
imagination
and
ours
and
unless
the
difference
be
only
one
of
quantity
it
were
well
to
change
into
nascitur
some
men
are
born
great
poets
some
small
the
cult
and
superstition
of
the
genius
has
arisen
from
this
quantitative
difference
having
been
taken
as
a
difference
of
quality
it
has
been
forgotten
that
genius
is
not
something
that
has
fallen
from
heaven
but
humanity
itself
the
man
of
genius
who
poses
or
is
represented
as
distant
from
humanity
finds
his
punishment
in
becoming
or
appearing
somewhat
ridiculous
examples
of
this
are
the
of
the
romantic
period
and
the
of
our
time
but
it
is
well
to
note
here
that
those
who
claim
unconsciousness
as
the
chief
quality
of
an
artistic
genius
hurl
him
from
an
eminence
far
above
humanity
to
a
position
far
below
it
intuitive
or
artistic
genius
like
every
form
of
human
activity
is
always
conscious
otherwise
it
would
be
blind
mechanism
the
only
thing
that
may
be
wanting
to
the
artistic
genius
is
the
consciousness
the
superadded
consciousness
of
the
historian
or
critic
which
is
not
essential
to
artistic
genius
sidenote
and
form
in
the
relation
between
matter
and
form
or
between
and
as
it
is
generally
called
is
one
of
the
most
disputed
questions
in
aesthetic
does
the
aesthetic
fact
consist
of
content
alone
or
of
form
alone
or
of
both
together
this
question
has
taken
on
various
meanings
which
we
shall
mention
each
in
its
place
but
when
these
words
are
taken
as
signifying
what
we
have
above
defined
and
matter
is
understood
as
emotivity
not
aesthetically
elaborated
that
is
to
say
impressions
and
form
elaboration
intellectual
activity
and
expression
then
our
meaning
can
not
be
doubtful
we
must
therefore
reject
the
thesis
that
makes
the
aesthetic
fact
to
consist
of
the
content
alone
that
is
of
the
simple
impressions
in
like
manner
with
that
other
thesis
which
makes
it
to
consist
of
a
junction
between
form
and
content
that
is
of
impressions
plus
expressions
in
the
aesthetic
fact
the
aesthetic
activity
is
not
added
to
the
fact
of
the
impressions
but
these
latter
are
formed
and
elaborated
by
it
the
impressions
reappear
as
it
were
in
expression
like
water
put
into
a
filter
which
reappears
the
same
and
yet
different
on
the
other
side
the
aesthetic
fact
therefore
is
form
and
nothing
but
form
from
this
it
results
not
that
the
content
is
something
superfluous
it
is
on
the
contrary
the
necessary
point
of
departure
for
the
expressive
fact
but
that
is
no
between
the
quality
of
the
content
and
that
of
the
form
it
has
sometimes
been
thought
that
the
content
in
order
to
be
aesthetic
that
is
to
say
transformable
into
form
should
possess
some
determinate
or
determinable
quality
but
were
that
so
then
form
and
content
expression
and
impression
would
be
the
same
thing
it
is
true
that
the
content
is
that
which
is
convertible
into
form
but
it
has
no
determinable
qualities
until
this
transformation
takes
place
we
know
nothing
of
its
nature
it
does
not
become
aesthetic
content
at
once
but
only
when
it
has
been
effectively
transformed
aesthetic
content
has
also
been
defined
as
what
is
that
is
not
an
untrue
statement
it
is
merely
void
of
meaning
what
then
is
interesting
expressive
activity
certainly
the
expressive
activity
would
not
have
raised
the
content
to
the
dignity
of
form
had
it
not
been
interested
the
fact
of
its
having
been
interested
is
precisely
the
fact
of
its
raising
the
content
to
the
dignity
of
form
but
the
word
interesting
has
also
been
employed
in
another
not
illegitimate
sense
which
we
shall
explain
further
on
sidenote
of
the
imitation
of
nature
and
of
the
artistic
the
proposition
that
art
is
of
has
also
several
meanings
now
truth
has
been
maintained
or
at
least
shadowed
with
these
words
now
error
more
frequently
nothing
definite
has
been
thought
one
of
the
legitimate
scientific
meanings
occurs
when
imitation
is
understood
as
representation
or
intuition
of
nature
a
form
of
knowledge
and
when
this
meaning
has
been
understood
by
placing
in
greater
relief
the
spiritual
character
of
the
process
the
other
proposition
becomes
also
legitimate
namely
that
art
is
the
or
imitation
of
nature
but
if
by
imitation
of
nature
be
understood
that
art
gives
mechanical
reproductions
more
or
less
perfect
duplicates
of
natural
objects
before
which
the
same
tumult
of
impressions
caused
by
natural
objects
begins
over
again
then
the
proposition
is
evidently
false
the
painted
wax
figures
that
seem
to
be
alive
and
before
which
we
stand
astonished
in
the
museums
where
such
things
are
shown
do
not
give
aesthetic
intuitions
illusion
and
hallucination
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
calm
domain
of
artistic
intuition
if
an
artist
paint
the
interior
of
a
museum
or
if
an
actor
give
a
burlesque
portrait
of
a
on
the
stage
we
again
have
spiritual
labour
and
artistic
intuition
finally
if
photography
have
anything
in
it
of
artistic
it
will
be
to
the
extent
that
it
transmits
the
intuition
of
the
photographer
his
point
of
view
the
pose
and
the
grouping
which
he
has
striven
to
attain
and
if
it
be
not
altogether
art
that
is
precisely
because
the
element
of
nature
in
it
remains
more
or
less
insubordinate
and
ineradicable
do
we
ever
indeed
feel
complete
satisfaction
before
even
the
best
of
photographs
would
not
an
artist
vary
and
touch
up
much
or
little
remove
or
add
something
to
any
of
them
sidenote
of
art
conceived
as
a
sentimental
not
a
theoretical
fact
aesthetic
appearance
and
the
statements
repeated
so
often
with
others
similar
that
art
is
not
knowledge
that
it
does
not
tell
the
truth
that
it
does
not
belong
to
the
world
of
theory
but
to
the
world
of
feeling
arise
from
the
failure
to
realize
exactly
the
theoretic
character
of
the
simple
intuition
this
simple
intuition
is
quite
distinct
from
intellectual
knowledge
as
it
is
distinct
from
the
perception
of
the
real
the
belief
that
only
the
intellective
is
knowledge
or
at
the
most
also
the
perception
of
the
real
also
arises
from
the
failure
to
grasp
the
theoretic
character
of
the
simple
intuition
we
have
seen
that
intuition
is
knowledge
free
of
concepts
and
more
simple
than
the
perception
of
the
real
since
art
is
knowledge
and
form
it
does
not
belong
to
the
world
of
feeling
and
of
psychic
material
the
reason
why
so
many
aestheticians
have
so
often
insisted
that
art
is
is
precisely
because
they
have
felt
the
necessity
of
distinguishing
it
from
the
more
complex
fact
of
perception
by
maintaining
its
pure
intuitivity
for
the
same
reason
it
has
been
claimed
that
art
is
in
fact
if
the
concept
as
content
of
art
and
historical
reality
as
such
be
excluded
there
remains
no
other
content
than
reality
apprehended
in
all
its
ingenuousness
and
immediateness
in
the
vital
effort
in
that
is
to
say
pure
intuition
sidenote
of
theory
of
aesthetic
the
theory
of
the
has
also
arisen
from
the
failure
to
establish
or
from
having
lost
to
view
the
character
of
the
expression
as
distinct
from
the
impression
of
the
form
as
distinct
from
the
matter
as
has
just
been
pointed
out
this
reduces
itself
to
the
error
of
wishing
to
seek
a
passage
from
the
quality
of
the
content
to
that
of
the
form
to
ask
in
fact
what
the
aesthetic
senses
may
be
implies
asking
what
sensible
impressions
may
be
able
to
enter
into
aesthetic
expressions
and
what
must
of
necessity
do
so
to
this
we
must
at
once
reply
that
all
impressions
can
enter
into
aesthetic
expressions
or
formations
but
that
none
are
bound
to
do
so
dante
raised
to
the
dignity
of
form
not
only
the
sweet
colour
of
the
oriental
sapphire
visual
impression
but
also
tactile
or
thermic
impressions
such
as
the
thick
air
and
the
fresh
rivulets
which
parch
all
the
more
the
throat
of
the
thirsty
the
belief
that
a
picture
yields
only
visual
impressions
is
a
curious
illusion
the
bloom
of
a
cheek
the
warmth
of
a
youthful
body
the
sweetness
and
freshness
of
a
fruit
the
cutting
of
a
sharpened
blade
are
not
these
also
impressions
that
we
have
from
a
picture
maybe
they
are
visual
what
would
a
picture
be
for
a
hypothetical
man
deprived
of
all
or
many
of
his
senses
who
should
in
an
instant
acquire
the
sole
organ
of
sight
the
picture
we
are
standing
opposite
and
believe
we
see
only
with
our
eyes
would
appear
to
his
eyes
as
little
more
than
the
palette
of
a
painter
some
who
hold
firmly
to
the
aesthetic
character
of
given
groups
of
impressions
for
example
the
visual
the
auditive
and
exclude
others
admit
however
that
if
visual
and
auditive
impressions
enter
into
the
aesthetic
fact
those
of
the
other
senses
also
enter
into
it
but
only
as
but
this
distinction
is
altogether
arbitrary
aesthetic
expression
is
a
synthesis
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
direct
and
indirect
all
impressions
are
by
it
placed
on
a
level
in
so
far
as
they
are
aestheticised
he
who
takes
into
himself
the
image
of
a
picture
or
of
a
poem
does
not
experience
as
it
were
a
series
of
impressions
as
to
this
image
some
of
which
have
a
prerogative
or
precedence
over
others
and
nothing
is
known
of
what
happens
prior
to
having
received
it
for
the
distinctions
made
after
reflexion
have
nothing
to
do
with
art
the
theory
of
the
aesthetic
senses
has
also
been
presented
in
another
way
that
is
to
say
as
the
attempt
to
establish
what
physiological
organs
are
necessary
for
the
aesthetic
fact
the
physiological
organ
or
apparatus
is
nothing
but
a
complex
of
cellules
thus
and
thus
constituted
thus
and
thus
disposed
that
is
to
say
it
is
merely
physical
and
natural
fact
or
concept
but
expression
does
not
recognize
physiological
facts
expression
has
its
point
of
departure
in
the
impressions
and
the
physiological
path
by
which
these
have
found
their
way
to
the
mind
is
to
it
altogether
indifferent
one
way
or
another
amounts
to
the
same
thing
it
suffices
that
they
are
impressions
it
is
true
that
the
want
of
given
organs
that
is
of
given
complexes
of
cells
produces
an
absence
of
given
impressions
when
these
are
not
obtained
by
another
path
by
a
kind
of
organic
compensation
the
man
born
blind
can
not
express
or
have
the
intuition
of
light
but
the
impressions
are
not
conditioned
solely
by
the
organ
but
also
by
the
stimuli
which
operate
upon
the
organ
thus
he
who
has
never
had
the
impression
of
the
sea
will
never
be
able
to
express
it
in
the
same
way
as
he
who
has
never
had
the
impression
of
the
great
world
or
of
the
political
conflict
will
never
express
the
one
or
the
other
this
however
does
not
establish
a
dependence
of
the
expressive
function
on
the
stimulus
or
on
the
organ
it
is
the
repetition
of
what
we
know
already
expression
presupposes
impression
therefore
given
expressions
imply
given
impressions
besides
every
impression
excludes
other
impressions
during
the
moment
in
which
it
dominates
and
so
does
every
expression
sidenote
and
indivisibility
of
the
work
of
another
corollary
of
the
conception
of
expression
as
activity
is
the
of
the
work
of
art
every
expression
is
a
unique
expression
activity
is
a
fusion
of
the
impressions
in
an
organic
whole
a
desire
to
express
this
has
always
prompted
the
affirmation
that
the
world
of
art
should
have
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
in
expression
is
a
synthesis
of
the
various
the
multiple
in
the
one
the
fact
that
we
divide
a
work
of
art
into
parts
as
a
poem
into
scenes
episodes
similes
sentences
or
a
picture
into
single
figures
and
objects
background
foreground
may
seem
to
be
an
objection
to
this
affirmation
but
such
division
annihilates
the
work
as
dividing
the
organism
into
heart
brain
nerves
muscles
and
so
on
turns
the
living
being
into
a
corpse
it
is
true
that
there
exist
organisms
in
which
the
division
gives
place
to
more
living
things
but
in
such
a
case
and
if
we
transfer
the
analogy
to
the
aesthetic
fact
we
must
conclude
for
a
multiplicity
of
germs
of
life
that
is
to
say
for
a
speedy
of
the
single
parts
into
new
single
expressions
it
will
be
observed
that
expression
is
sometimes
based
on
other
expressions
there
are
simple
and
there
are
expressions
one
must
admit
some
difference
between
the
with
which
archimedes
expressed
all
his
joy
after
his
discovery
and
the
expressive
act
indeed
all
the
five
acts
of
a
regular
tragedy
not
in
the
least
expression
is
always
directly
based
on
impressions
he
who
conceives
a
tragedy
puts
into
a
crucible
a
great
quantity
so
to
say
of
impressions
the
expressions
themselves
conceived
on
other
occasions
are
fused
together
with
the
new
in
a
single
mass
in
the
same
way
as
we
can
cast
into
a
smelting
furnace
formless
pieces
of
bronze
and
most
precious
statuettes
those
most
precious
statuettes
must
be
melted
in
the
same
way
as
the
formless
bits
of
bronze
before
there
can
be
a
new
statue
the
old
expressions
must
descend
again
to
the
level
of
impressions
in
order
to
be
synthetized
in
a
new
single
expression
sidenote
as
the
by
elaborating
his
impressions
man
himself
from
them
by
objectifying
them
he
removes
them
from
him
and
makes
himself
their
superior
the
liberating
and
purifying
function
of
art
is
another
aspect
and
another
formula
of
its
character
of
activity
activity
is
the
deliverer
just
because
it
drives
away
passivity
this
also
explains
why
it
is
customary
to
attribute
to
artists
alike
the
maximum
of
sensibility
or
and
the
maximum
insensibility
or
olympic
both
qualifications
agree
for
they
do
not
refer
to
the
same
object
the
sensibility
or
passion
relates
to
the
rich
material
which
the
artist
absorbs
into
his
psychic
organism
the
insensibility
or
serenity
to
the
form
with
which
he
subjugates
and
dominates
the
tumult
of
the
feelings
and
of
the
passions
iii
art
and
philosophy
sidenote
of
intellective
from
intuitive
the
two
forms
of
knowledge
aesthetic
and
intellectual
or
conceptual
are
indeed
diverse
but
this
does
not
amount
altogether
to
separation
and
disjunction
as
we
find
with
two
forces
going
each
its
own
way
if
we
have
shown
that
the
aesthetic
form
is
altogether
independent
of
the
intellectual
and
suffices
to
itself
without
external
support
we
have
not
said
that
the
intellectual
can
stand
without
the
aesthetic
this
would
not
be
true
what
is
knowledge
by
concepts
it
is
knowledge
of
relations
of
things
and
those
things
are
intuitions
concepts
are
not
possible
without
intuitions
just
as
intuition
is
itself
impossible
without
the
material
of
impressions
intuitions
are
this
river
this
lake
this
brook
this
rain
this
glass
of
water
the
concept
is
water
not
this
or
that
appearance
and
particular
example
of
water
but
water
in
general
in
whatever
time
or
place
it
be
realized
the
material
of
infinite
intuitions
but
of
one
single
and
constant
concept
however
the
concept
the
universal
if
it
be
no
longer
intuition
in
one
respect
is
in
another
respect
intuition
and
can
not
fail
of
being
intuition
for
the
man
who
thinks
has
impressions
and
emotions
in
so
far
as
he
thinks
his
impression
and
emotion
will
not
be
love
or
hate
but
effort
of
his
thought
with
the
pain
and
the
joy
the
love
and
the
hate
joined
to
it
this
effort
can
not
but
become
intuitive
in
form
in
becoming
objective
to
the
mind
to
speak
is
not
to
think
logically
but
to
is
at
the
same
time
to
sidenote
of
the
negations
of
this
that
thought
can
not
exist
without
speech
is
a
truth
generally
admitted
the
negations
of
this
thesis
are
all
founded
on
equivoques
and
errors
the
first
of
the
equivoques
is
implied
by
those
who
observe
that
one
can
likewise
think
with
geometrical
figures
algebraical
numbers
ideographic
signs
without
a
single
word
even
pronounced
silently
and
almost
insensibly
within
one
they
also
affirm
that
there
are
languages
in
which
the
word
the
phonetic
sign
expresses
nothing
unless
the
written
sign
also
be
looked
at
but
when
we
said
speech
we
intended
to
employ
a
synecdoche
and
that
expression
generically
should
be
understood
for
expression
is
not
only
verbal
expression
as
we
have
already
noted
it
may
be
admitted
that
certain
concepts
may
be
thought
without
phonetic
manifestations
but
the
very
examples
adduced
to
show
this
also
prove
that
those
concepts
never
exist
without
expressions
others
maintain
that
animals
or
certain
animals
think
or
reason
without
speaking
now
as
to
how
whether
and
what
animals
think
whether
they
be
rudimentary
men
resisting
civilization
rather
than
physiological
machines
as
the
old
spiritualists
would
have
it
are
questions
that
do
not
concern
us
here
when
the
philosopher
talks
of
animal
brutal
impulsive
instinctive
nature
and
the
like
he
does
not
base
himself
on
conjectures
as
to
these
facts
concerning
dogs
or
cats
lions
or
ants
but
upon
observations
of
what
is
called
animal
and
brutal
in
man
of
the
boundary
or
animal
basis
of
what
we
feel
in
ourselves
if
individual
animals
dogs
or
cats
lions
or
ants
possess
something
of
the
activity
of
man
so
much
the
better
or
so
much
the
worse
for
them
this
means
that
as
regards
them
also
we
must
talk
not
of
their
nature
as
a
whole
but
of
its
animal
basis
as
being
perhaps
larger
and
more
strong
than
the
animal
basis
of
man
and
if
we
suppose
that
animals
think
and
form
concepts
what
is
there
in
the
line
of
conjecture
to
justify
the
admission
that
they
do
so
without
corresponding
expressions
the
analogy
with
man
the
knowledge
of
the
spirit
human
psychology
which
is
the
instrument
of
all
our
conjectures
as
to
animal
psychology
would
oblige
us
to
suppose
that
if
they
think
in
any
way
they
also
have
some
sort
of
speech
it
is
from
human
psychology
that
is
literary
psychology
that
comes
the
other
objection
to
the
effect
that
the
concept
can
exist
without
the
word
because
it
is
true
that
we
all
know
books
that
are
thought
and
badly
that
is
to
say
a
thought
which
remains
thought
the
expression
the
imperfect
expression
but
when
we
talk
of
books
well
thought
and
badly
written
we
can
not
mean
other
than
that
in
those
books
are
parts
pages
periods
or
propositions
well
thought
out
and
well
written
and
other
parts
perhaps
the
least
important
ill
thought
out
and
badly
written
not
truly
thought
out
and
therefore
not
truly
expressed
where
vico
is
really
ill
written
it
is
also
ill
thought
out
if
we
pass
from
the
consideration
of
big
books
to
a
short
proposition
the
error
or
the
imprecision
of
this
statement
will
be
recognized
at
once
how
could
a
proposition
be
clearly
thought
and
confusedly
written
out
all
that
can
be
admitted
is
that
sometimes
we
possess
thoughts
concepts
in
an
intuitive
form
or
in
an
abbreviated
or
better
peculiar
expression
sufficient
for
us
but
not
sufficient
to
communicate
it
with
ease
to
another
or
other
definite
individuals
hence
people
say
inaccurately
that
we
have
the
thought
without
the
expression
whereas
it
should
properly
be
said
that
we
have
indeed
the
expression
but
in
a
form
that
is
not
easy
of
social
communication
this
however
is
a
very
variable
and
altogether
relative
fact
there
are
always
people
who
catch
our
thought
on
the
wing
and
prefer
it
in
this
abbreviated
form
and
would
be
displeased
with
the
greater
development
of
it
necessary
for
other
people
in
other
words
the
thought
considered
abstractly
and
logically
will
be
the
same
but
aesthetically
we
are
dealing
with
two
different
into
both
of
which
enter
different
psychological
elements
the
same
argument
suffices
to
destroy
that
is
to
interpret
correctly
the
altogether
empirical
distinction
between
an
and
an
language
sidenote
and
the
most
lofty
manifestations
the
summits
of
intellectual
and
of
intuitive
knowledge
shining
from
afar
are
called
as
we
know
art
and
science
art
and
science
then
are
different
and
yet
linked
together
they
meet
on
one
side
which
is
the
aesthetic
side
every
scientific
work
is
also
a
work
of
art
the
aesthetic
side
may
remain
little
noticed
when
our
mind
is
altogether
taken
up
with
the
effort
to
understand
the
thought
of
the
man
of
science
and
to
examine
its
truth
but
it
is
no
longer
concealed
when
we
pass
from
the
activity
of
understanding
to
that
of
contemplation
and
behold
that
thought
either
developed
before
us
limpid
exact
without
superfluous
words
without
lack
of
words
with
appropriate
rhythm
and
intonation
or
confused
broken
embarrassed
tentative
great
thinkers
are
sometimes
termed
great
writers
while
other
equally
great
thinkers
remain
more
or
less
fragmentary
writers
if
indeed
their
fragments
are
scientifically
to
be
compared
with
harmonious
coherent
and
perfect
works
sidenote
and
form
another
meaning
prose
and
we
pardon
thinkers
and
men
of
science
their
literary
mediocrity
the
fragments
console
us
for
the
failure
of
the
whole
for
it
is
far
more
easy
to
recover
the
composition
from
the
fragmentary
work
of
genius
than
to
achieve
the
discovery
of
genius
but
how
can
we
pardon
mediocre
expression
in
pure
artists
esse
poetis
non
di
non
homines
non
concessere
the
poet
or
painter
who
lacks
form
lacks
everything
because
he
lacks
poetical
material
permeates
the
soul
of
all
the
expression
alone
that
is
to
say
the
form
makes
the
poet
and
here
appears
the
truth
of
the
thesis
which
denies
to
art
all
content
as
content
being
understood
just
the
intellectual
concept
in
this
sense
when
we
take
content
as
equal
to
concept
it
is
most
true
not
only
that
art
does
not
consist
of
content
but
also
that
has
no
in
the
same
way
the
distinction
between
and
can
not
be
justified
save
in
that
of
art
and
science
it
was
seen
in
antiquity
that
such
distinction
could
not
be
founded
on
external
elements
such
as
rhythm
and
metre
or
on
the
freedom
or
the
limitation
of
the
form
that
it
was
on
the
contrary
altogether
internal
poetry
is
the
language
of
sentiment
prose
of
the
intellect
but
since
the
intellect
is
also
sentiment
in
its
concretion
and
reality
so
all
prose
has
a
poetical
side
sidenote
relation
of
first
and
second
the
relation
between
intuitive
knowledge
or
expression
and
intellectual
knowledge
or
concept
between
art
and
science
poetry
and
prose
can
not
be
otherwise
defined
than
by
saying
that
it
is
one
of
the
first
degree
is
the
expression
the
second
the
concept
the
first
can
exist
without
the
second
but
the
second
can
not
exist
without
the
first
there
exists
poetry
without
prose
but
not
prose
without
poetry
expression
indeed
is
the
first
affirmation
of
human
activity
poetry
is
the
maternal
language
of
the
human
race
the
first
men
were
by
nature
sublime
poets
we
also
admit
this
in
another
way
when
we
observe
that
the
passage
from
soul
to
mind
from
animal
to
human
activity
is
effected
by
means
of
language
and
this
should
be
said
of
intuition
or
expression
in
general
but
to
us
it
appears
somewhat
inaccurate
to
define
language
or
expression
as
an
link
between
nature
and
humanity
as
though
it
were
a
mixture
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
where
humanity
appears
the
rest
has
already
disappeared
the
man
who
expresses
himself
certainly
emerges
from
the
state
of
nature
but
he
really
does
emerge
he
does
not
stand
half
within
and
half
without
as
the
use
of
the
phrase
intermediate
link
would
imply
sidenote
of
other
forms
of
the
cognitive
intellect
has
no
form
other
than
these
two
expression
and
concept
exhaust
it
completely
the
whole
speculative
life
of
man
is
spent
in
passing
from
one
to
the
other
and
back
again
sidenote
its
identity
with
and
difference
from
is
incorrectly
held
to
be
a
third
theoretical
form
history
is
not
form
but
content
as
form
it
is
nothing
but
intuition
or
aesthetic
fact
history
does
not
seek
for
laws
nor
form
concepts
it
employs
neither
induction
nor
deduction
it
is
directed
narrandum
non
ad
it
does
not
construct
universals
and
abstractions
but
posits
intuitions
the
this
the
that
the
omni
modo
is
its
kingdom
as
it
is
the
kingdom
of
art
history
therefore
is
included
under
the
universal
concept
of
art
faced
with
this
proposition
and
with
the
impossibility
of
conceiving
a
third
mode
of
knowledge
objections
have
been
brought
forward
which
would
lead
to
the
affiliation
of
history
to
intellective
or
scientific
knowledge
the
greater
portion
of
these
objections
is
dominated
by
the
prejudice
that
in
refusing
to
history
the
character
of
conceptual
science
something
of
its
value
and
dignity
has
been
taken
from
it
this
really
arises
from
a
false
idea
of
art
conceived
not
as
an
essential
theoretic
function
but
as
an
amusement
a
superfluity
a
frivolity
without
reopening
a
long
debate
which
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
finally
closed
we
will
mention
here
one
sophism
which
has
been
and
still
is
widely
repeated
it
is
intended
to
show
the
logical
and
scientific
nature
of
history
the
sophism
consists
in
admitting
that
historical
knowledge
has
for
its
object
the
individual
but
not
the
representation
it
is
added
so
much
as
the
concept
of
the
individual
from
this
it
is
argued
that
history
is
also
a
logical
or
scientific
form
of
knowledge
history
in
fact
should
elaborate
the
concept
of
a
personage
such
as
charlemagne
or
napoleon
of
an
epoch
like
the
renaissance
or
the
reformation
of
an
event
such
as
the
french
revolution
and
the
unification
of
italy
this
it
is
held
to
do
in
the
same
way
as
geometry
elaborates
the
concepts
of
spatial
form
or
aesthetic
those
of
expression
but
all
this
is
untrue
history
can
not
do
otherwise
than
represent
napoleon
and
charlemagne
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
the
french
revolution
and
the
unification
of
italy
as
individual
facts
with
their
individual
physiognomy
that
is
in
the
same
way
as
logicians
state
that
one
can
not
have
a
concept
of
an
individual
but
only
a
representation
the
concept
of
the
individual
is
always
a
universal
or
general
concept
full
of
details
very
rich
if
you
will
but
however
rich
it
be
yet
incapable
of
attaining
to
that
individuality
to
which
historical
knowledge
as
aesthetic
knowledge
alone
attains
let
us
rather
show
how
the
content
of
history
comes
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
art
the
distinction
is
secondary
its
origin
will
be
found
in
what
has
already
been
observed
as
to
the
ideal
character
of
the
intuition
or
first
perception
in
which
all
is
real
and
therefore
nothing
is
real
the
mind
forms
the
concepts
of
external
and
internal
at
a
later
stage
as
it
does
those
of
what
has
happened
and
of
what
is
desired
of
object
and
subject
and
the
like
thus
it
distinguishes
historical
from
intuition
the
from
the
real
fancy
from
pure
fancy
even
internal
facts
what
is
desired
and
imagined
castles
in
the
air
and
countries
of
cockagne
have
their
reality
the
soul
too
has
its
history
his
illusions
form
part
of
the
biography
of
every
individual
but
the
history
of
an
individual
soul
is
history
because
in
it
is
always
active
the
distinction
between
the
real
and
the
unreal
even
when
the
real
is
the
illusions
themselves
but
these
distinctive
concepts
do
not
appear
in
history
as
do
scientific
concepts
but
rather
like
those
that
we
have
seen
dissolved
and
melted
in
the
aesthetic
intuitions
although
they
stand
out
in
history
in
an
altogether
new
relief
history
does
not
construct
the
concepts
of
the
real
and
unreal
but
makes
use
of
them
history
in
fact
is
not
the
theory
of
history
mere
conceptual
analysis
is
of
no
use
in
realizing
whether
an
event
in
our
lives
were
real
or
imaginary
it
is
necessary
to
reproduce
the
intuitions
in
the
mind
in
the
most
complete
form
as
they
were
at
the
moment
of
production
in
order
to
recognize
the
content
historicity
is
distinguished
in
the
concrete
from
pure
imagination
only
as
one
intuition
is
distinguished
from
another
in
the
memory
sidenote
sidenote
where
this
is
not
possible
owing
to
the
delicate
and
fleeting
shades
between
the
real
and
unreal
intuitions
which
confuse
the
one
with
the
other
we
must
either
renounce
for
the
time
at
least
the
knowledge
of
what
really
happened
and
this
we
often
do
or
we
must
fall
back
upon
conjecture
verisimilitude
probability
the
principle
of
verisimilitude
and
of
probability
dominates
in
fact
all
historical
criticism
examination
of
the
sources
and
of
authority
is
directed
toward
establishing
the
most
credible
evidence
and
what
is
the
most
credible
evidence
save
that
of
the
best
observers
that
is
of
those
who
best
remember
and
be
it
understood
have
not
desired
to
falsify
nor
had
interest
in
falsifying
the
truth
of
things
from
this
it
follows
that
intellectual
scepticism
finds
it
easy
to
deny
the
certainty
of
any
history
for
the
certainty
of
history
is
never
that
of
science
historical
certainty
is
composed
of
memory
and
of
authority
not
of
analyses
and
of
demonstration
to
speak
of
historical
induction
or
demonstration
is
to
make
a
metaphorical
use
of
these
expressions
which
bear
quite
a
different
meaning
in
history
to
that
which
they
bear
in
science
the
conviction
of
the
historian
is
the
undemonstrable
conviction
of
the
juryman
who
has
heard
the
witnesses
listened
attentively
to
the
case
and
prayed
heaven
to
inspire
him
sometimes
without
doubt
he
is
mistaken
but
the
mistakes
are
in
a
negligible
minority
compared
with
the
occasions
when
he
gets
hold
of
the
truth
that
is
why
good
sense
is
right
against
the
intellectualists
in
believing
in
history
which
is
not
a
fable
agreed
upon
but
that
which
the
individual
and
humanity
remember
of
their
past
we
strive
to
enlarge
and
to
render
as
precise
as
possible
this
record
which
in
some
places
is
dim
in
others
very
clear
we
can
not
do
without
it
such
as
it
is
and
taken
as
a
whole
it
is
rich
in
truth
in
a
spirit
of
paradox
only
can
one
doubt
if
there
ever
were
a
greece
or
a
rome
an
alexander
or
a
caesar
a
feudal
europe
overthrown
by
a
series
of
revolutions
that
on
the
of
november
the
theses
of
luther
were
seen
fixed
to
the
door
of
the
church
of
wittenberg
or
that
the
bastile
was
taken
by
the
people
of
paris
on
the
of
july
what
proof
givest
thou
of
all
this
asks
the
sophist
ironically
humanity
replies
i
remember
sidenote
as
perfect
science
the
natural
sciences
and
their
the
world
of
what
has
happened
of
the
concrete
of
history
is
the
world
that
is
called
real
natural
including
in
this
definition
the
reality
that
is
called
physical
as
well
as
that
which
is
called
spiritual
and
human
all
this
world
is
intuition
historical
intuition
if
it
be
realistically
shown
as
it
is
or
imaginary
intuition
artistic
in
the
strict
sense
if
shown
under
the
aspect
of
the
possible
that
is
to
say
of
the
imaginable
science
true
science
which
is
not
intuition
but
concept
not
individuality
but
universality
can
not
be
anything
but
a
science
of
the
spirit
that
is
of
what
is
universal
in
reality
philosophy
if
natural
be
spoken
of
apart
from
philosophy
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
these
are
not
perfect
sciences
they
are
complexes
of
knowledge
arbitrarily
abstracted
and
fixed
the
natural
sciences
themselves
recognize
in
fact
that
they
are
surrounded
by
limitations
these
limitations
are
nothing
more
than
historical
and
intuitive
data
they
calculate
measure
establish
equalities
regularity
create
classes
and
types
formulate
laws
show
in
their
own
way
how
one
fact
arises
out
of
other
facts
but
in
their
progress
they
are
always
met
with
facts
which
are
known
intuitively
and
historically
even
geometry
now
states
that
it
rests
altogether
on
hypotheses
since
space
is
not
or
euclidean
but
this
assumption
is
made
use
of
by
preference
because
it
is
more
convenient
what
there
is
of
truth
in
the
natural
sciences
is
either
philosophy
or
historical
fact
what
they
contain
proper
to
themselves
is
abstract
and
arbitrary
when
the
natural
sciences
wish
to
form
themselves
into
perfect
sciences
they
must
issue
from
their
circle
and
enter
the
philosophical
circle
this
they
do
when
they
posit
concepts
which
are
anything
but
natural
such
as
those
of
the
atom
without
extension
in
space
of
ether
or
vibrating
matter
of
vital
force
of
space
beyond
the
reach
of
intuition
and
the
like
these
are
true
and
proper
philosophical
efforts
when
they
are
not
mere
words
void
of
meaning
the
concepts
of
natural
science
are
without
doubt
most
useful
but
one
can
not
obtain
from
them
that
which
belongs
only
to
the
spirit
these
historical
and
intuitive
assumptions
which
can
not
be
separated
from
the
natural
sciences
furthermore
explain
not
only
how
in
the
progress
of
knowledge
that
which
was
once
considered
to
be
truth
descends
gradually
to
the
grade
of
mythological
beliefs
and
imaginary
illusions
but
also
how
among
natural
scientists
there
are
some
who
term
all
that
serves
as
basis
of
argument
in
their
teaching
facts
verbal
or
the
naturalists
and
mathematicians
who
approach
the
study
of
the
energies
of
the
spirit
without
preparation
are
apt
to
carry
thither
these
mental
habits
and
to
speak
in
philosophy
of
such
and
such
conventions
as
arranged
by
man
they
make
conventions
of
truth
and
morality
and
their
supreme
convention
is
the
spirit
itself
however
if
there
are
to
be
conventions
something
must
exist
about
which
there
is
no
convention
to
be
made
but
which
is
itself
the
agent
of
the
convention
this
is
the
spiritual
activity
of
man
the
limitation
of
the
natural
sciences
postulates
the
illimitation
of
philosophy
sidenote
phenomenon
and
the
these
explications
have
firmly
established
that
the
pure
or
fundamental
forms
of
knowledge
are
two
the
intuition
and
the
concept
art
and
science
or
philosophy
with
these
are
to
be
included

which
is
as
it
were
the
product
of
intuition
placed
in
contact
with
the
concept
that
is
of

receiving
in
itself
philosophic
distinctions
while
remaining
concrete
and
individual
all
the
other
forms
natural

and
mathematics
are
impure

mingled
with
extraneous
elements
of

and

these
relations
between
intuitive
or
aesthetic
knowledge
and
the
other
fundamental
or
derivative
forms
of
knowledge
having
been
definitely
established
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
reveal
the
errors
of
a
series
of
theories
which
have
been
or
are
presented
as
theories
of
aesthetic
sidenote
of
verisimilitude
and
of
from
the
confusion
between
the
exigencies
of
art
in
general
and
the
particular
exigencies
of
history
has
arisen
the
theory
which
has
lost
ground
but
used
to
dominate
in
the
past
of
as
the
object
of
art
as
is
generally
the
case
with
erroneous
propositions
the
intention
of
those
who
employed
and
employ
the
concept
of
verisimilitude
has
no
doubt
often
been
much
more
reasonable
than
the
definition
given
of
the
word
by
verisimilitude
used
to
be
meant
the
artistic
of
the
representation
that
is
to
say
its
completeness
and
effectiveness
if
verisimilar
be
translated
by
coherent
a
most
exact
meaning
will
often
be
found
in
the
discussions
examples
and
judgments
of
the
critics
an
improbable
personage
an
improbable
ending
to
a
comedy
are
really
personages
endings
happenings
without
artistic
motive
it
has
been
said
with
reason
that
even
fairies
and
sprites
must
have
verisimilitude
that
is
to
say
be
really
sprites
and
fairies
coherent
artistic
intuitions
sometimes
the
word
possible
has
been
used
instead
of
verisimilar
as
we
have
already
remarked
in
passing
this
word
possible
is
synonymous
with
that
which
is
imaginable
or
may
be
known
intuitively
everything
which
is
really
that
is
to
say
coherently
imagined
is
possible
but
formerly
and
especially
by
the
theoreticians
by
verisimilar
was
understood
historical
credibility
or
that
historical
truth
which
is
not
demonstrable
but
conjecturable
not
true
but
verisimilar
it
has
been
sought
to
impose
a
like
character
upon
art
who
does
not
recall
the
great
part
played
in
literary
history
by
the
criticism
of
the
verisimilar
for
example
the
fault
found
with
the
based
upon
the
history
of
the
crusades
or
of
the
homeric
poems
upon
that
of
the
verisimilitude
of
the
costume
of
the
emperors
and
kings
at
other
times
has
been
imposed
upon
art
the
duty
of
the
aesthetic
reproduction
of
historical
reality
this
is
another
of
the
erroneous
significations
assumed
by
the
theory
concerning
imitation
of
verism
and
naturalism
have
since
afforded
the
spectacle
of
a
confusion
of
the
aesthetic
fact
with
the
processes
of
the
natural
sciences
by
aiming
at
some
sort
of
drama
or
romance
sidenote
of
ideas
in
art
of
theses
in
art
and
of
the
the
confusions
between
the
methods
of
art
and
those
of
the
philosophical
sciences
have
been
far
more
frequent
thus
it
has
often
been
held
to
be
within
the
competence
of
art
to
develop
concepts
to
unite
the
intelligible
with
the
sensible
to
represent
or
putting
art
in
the
place
of
science
that
is
confusing
the
artistic
function
in
general
with
the
particular
case
in
which
it
becomes
the
theory
of
art
as
supporting
can
be
reduced
to
the
same
error
as
can
be
the
theory
of
art
considered
as
individual
representation
exemplifying
scientific
laws
the
example
in
so
far
as
it
is
an
example
stands
for
the
thing
exemplified
and
is
thus
an
exposition
of
the
universal
that
is
to
say
a
form
of
science
more
or
less
popular
or
vulgarized
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
aesthetic
theory
of
the
when
by
type
is
understood
as
it
frequently
is
just
the
abstraction
or
the
concept
and
it
is
affirmed
that
art
should
make
species
shine
in
the
if
by
typical
be
here
understood
the
individual
here
too
we
have
a
merely
verbal
variation
to
typify
would
signify
in
this
case
to
characterize
that
is
to
determine
and
to
represent
the
individual
don
quixote
is
a
type
but
of
whom
is
he
a
type
if
not
of
all
don
quixotes
a
type
that
is
to
say
of
himself
certainly
he
is
not
a
type
of
abstract
concepts
such
as
the
loss
of
the
sense
of
reality
or
of
the
love
of
glory
an
infinite
number
of
personages
can
be
thought
of
under
these
concepts
who
are
not
don
quixote
in
other
words
we
find
our
own
impressions
fully
determined
and
verified
in
the
expression
of
a
poet
for
example
in
a
poetical
personage
we
call
that
expression
typical
which
we
might
call
simply
aesthetic
poetical
or
artistic
universals
have
been
spoken
of
in
like
manner
in
order
to
show
that
the
artistic
product
is
altogether
spiritual
and
ideal
in
itself
sidenote
of
the
symbol
and
of
the
continuing
to
correct
these
errors
or
to
make
clear
equivoques
we
will
note
that
the
has
sometimes
been
given
as
essence
of
art
now
if
the
symbol
be
given
as
inseparable
from
the
artistic
intuition
it
is
the
synonym
of
the
intuition
itself
which
always
has
an
ideal
character
there
is
no
to
art
but
one
only
in
art
all
is
symbolical
because
all
is
ideal
but
if
the
symbol
be
looked
upon
as
separable
if
on
the
one
side
can
be
expressed
the
symbol
and
on
the
other
the
thing
symbolized
we
fall
back
again
into
the
intellectualist
error
that
pretended
symbol
is
the
exposition
of
an
abstract
concept
it
is
an
it
is
science
or
art
that
apes
science
but
we
must
be
just
toward
the
allegorical
also
in
some
cases
it
is
altogether
harmless
given
the
the
allegory
was
imagined
afterwards
given
the
of
marino
the
poet
of
the
lascivious
insinuated
afterwards
that
it
was
written
to
show
how
immoderate
indulgence
ends
in
pain
given
a
statue
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
sculptor
can
write
on
a
card
that
the
statue
represents
or
this
allegory
linked
to
a
finished
work
does
not
change
the
work
of
art
what
is
it
then
it
is
an
expression
externally
to
another
expression
a
little
page
of
prose
is
added
to
the
expressing
another
thought
of
the
poet
a
verse
or
a
strophe
is
added
to
the
expressing
what
the
poet
would
like
to
make
a
part
of
his
public
swallow
while
to
the
statue
nothing
more
than
the
single
word
is
added
or
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
but
the
greatest
triumph
of
the
intellectualist
error
lies
in
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
which
still
has
vogue
in
literary
treatises
and
disturbs
the
critics
and
the
historians
of
art
let
us
observe
its
genesis
the
human
mind
can
pass
from
the
aesthetic
to
the
logical
just
because
the
former
is
a
first
step
in
respect
to
the
latter
it
can
destroy
the
expressions
that
is
the
thought
of
the
individual
with
the
thought
of
the
universal
it
can
reduce
expressive
facts
to
logical
relations
we
have
already
shown
that
this
operation
in
its
turn
becomes
concrete
in
an
expression
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
first
expressions
have
not
been
destroyed
they
have
yielded
their
place
to
the
new
expressions
when
we
are
on
the
second
step
we
have
left
the
first
he
who
enters
a
or
who
reads
a
series
of
poems
may
after
he
has
looked
and
read
go
further
he
may
seek
out
the
relations
of
the
things
there
expressed
thus
those
pictures
and
compositions
each
of
which
is
an
individual
inexpressible
by
logic
are
resolved
into
universals
and
abstractions
such
as
landscapes
portraits
domestic
life
battles
animals
flowers
fruit
seascapes
lakes
deserts
tragic
comic
piteous
cruel
lyrical
epic
dramatic
knightly
idyllic
and
the
like
they
are
often
also
resolved
into
merely
quantitative
categories
such
as
picture
picture
statuette
group
madrigal
song
sonnet
garland
of
sonnets
poetry
poem
story
and
the
like
when
we
think
the
concept
or
or
or
or
any
other
quantitative
concept
the
individual
expressive
fact
from
which
we
started
is
abandoned
from
aesthetes
that
we
were
we
have
been
changed
into
logicians
from
contemplators
of
expression
into
reasoners
certainly
no
objection
can
be
made
to
such
a
process
in
what
other
way
could
science
be
born
which
if
aesthetic
expressions
be
assumed
in
it
yet
has
for
function
to
go
beyond
them
the
logical
or
scientific
form
as
such
excludes
the
aesthetic
form
he
who
begins
to
think
scientifically
has
already
ceased
to
contemplate
aesthetically
although
his
thought
will
assume
of
necessity
in
its
turn
an
aesthetic
form
as
has
already
been
said
and
as
it
would
be
superfluous
to
repeat
the
error
begins
when
we
try
to
deduce
the
expression
from
the
concept
and
to
find
in
the
thing
substituting
the
laws
of
the
thing
substituted
when
the
difference
between
the
second
and
the
first
step
has
not
been
observed
and
when
in
consequence
we
declare
that
we
are
standing
on
the
first
step
when
we
are
really
standing
on
the
second
this
error
is
known
as
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
what
is
the
aesthetic
form
of
domestic
life
of
knighthood
of
the
idyll
of
cruelty
and
so
forth
how
should
these
contents
be
such
is
the
absurd
problem
implied
in
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
it
is
in
this
that
consists
all
search
after
laws
or
rules
of
styles
domestic
life
knighthood
idyll
cruelty
and
the
like
are
not
impressions
but
concepts
they
are
not
contents
but
forms
you
can
not
express
the
form
for
it
is
already
itself
expression
and
what
are
the
words
cruelty
idyll
knighthood
domestic
life
and
so
on
but
the
expression
of
those
concepts
even
the
most
refined
of
these
distinctions
those
that
have
the
most
philosophic
appearance
do
not
resist
criticism
as
for
instance
when
works
of
art
are
divided
into
the
subjective
and
the
objective
styles
into
lyric
and
epic
into
works
of
feeling
and
works
of
design
it
is
impossible
to
separate
in
aesthetic
analysis
the
subjective
from
the
objective
side
the
lyric
from
the
epic
the
image
of
feeling
from
that
of
things
sidenote
derived
from
this
theory
appearing
in
judgments
on
from
the
theory
of
the
artistic
and
literary
classes
derive
those
erroneous
modes
of
judgment
and
of
criticism
thanks
to
which
instead
of
asking
before
a
work
of
art
if
it
be
expressive
and
what
it
expresses
whether
it
speak
or
stammer
or
be
silent
altogether
it
is
asked
if
it
be
obedient
to
the
of
the
epic
poem
or
to
those
of
tragedy
to
those
of
historical
portraiture
or
to
those
of
landscape
painting
artists
however
while
making
a
verbal
pretence
of
agreeing
or
yielding
a
feigned
obedience
to
them
have
really
always
disregarded
these
of
every
true
work
of
art
has
violated
some
established
class
and
upset
the
ideas
of
the
critics
who
have
thus
been
obliged
to
enlarge
the
number
of
classes
until
finally
even
this
enlargement
has
proved
too
narrow
owing
to
the
appearance
of
new
works
of
art
which
are
naturally
followed
by
new
scandals
new
upsettings
enlargements
from
the
same
theory
come
the
prejudices
owing
to
which
at
one
time
and
is
it
really
passed
people
used
to
lament
that
italy
had
no
tragedy
until
a
poet
arose
who
gave
to
italy
that
wreath
which
was
the
only
thing
wanting
to
her
glorious
hair
nor
france
the
epic
poem
until
the
which
slaked
the
thirsty
throats
of
the
critics
eulogies
accorded
to
the
inventors
of
new
styles
are
connected
with
these
prejudices
so
much
so
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
invention
of
the
poem
seemed
an
important
event
and
the
honour
of
it
was
disputed
as
though
it
were
the
discovery
of
america
but
the
works
adorned
with
this
name
the
and
the
degli
were
because
their
authors
a
slight
had
nothing
new
or
original
to
say
mediocrities
racked
their
brains
to
invent
artificially
new
styles
the
eclogue
was
added
to
the
and
then
finally
the
eclogue
the
was
bathed
and
became
the
finally
there
have
been
historians
of
art
and
literature
so
much
fascinated
with
these
ideas
of
classes
that
they
claimed
to
write
the
history
not
of
single
and
effective
literary
and
artistic
works
but
of
their
classes
those
empty
phantoms
they
have
claimed
to
portray
not
the
evolution
of
the
but
the
of
the
philosophical
condemnation
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
is
found
in
the
formulation
and
demonstration
of
what
artistic
activity
has
ever
sought
and
good
taste
ever
recognized
what
is
to
be
done
if
good
taste
and
the
real
fact
put
into
formulas
sometimes
assume
the
air
of
paradoxes
sidenote
sense
of
the
divisions
of
now
if
we
talk
of
tragedies
comedies
dramas
romances
pictures
of
everyday
life
landscapes
seascapes
poems
versicles
lyrics
and
the
like
if
it
be
only
with
a
view
to
be
understood
and
to
draw
attention
in
general
and
approximatively
to
certain
groups
of
works
to
which
for
one
reason
or
another
it
is
desired
to
draw
attention
in
that
case
no
scientific
error
has
been
committed
we
employ
and
we
do
not
establish
and
the
mistake
arises
when
the
weight
of
a
scientific
definition
is
given
to
a
word
when
we
ingenuously
let
ourselves
be
caught
in
the
meshes
of
that
phraseology
pray
permit
me
a
comparison
it
is
necessary
to
arrange
the
books
in
a
library
in
one
way
or
another
this
used
generally
to
be
done
by
means
of
a
rough
classification
by
subjects
among
which
the
categories
of
miscellaneous
and
eccentric
were
not
wanting
they
are
now
generally
arranged
by
sizes
or
by
publishers
who
can
deny
the
necessity
and
the
utility
of
these
groupings
but
what
should
we
say
if
some
one
began
seriously
to
seek
out
the
literary
laws
of
miscellanies
and
of
eccentricities
from
the
aldine
or
bodonian
collection
from
size
a
or
size
b
that
is
to
say
from
these
altogether
arbitrary
groupings
whose
sole
object
has
been
their
practical
use
well
whoever
should
undertake
an
enterprise
such
as
this
would
be
doing
neither
more
nor
less
than
those
who
seek
out
the
aesthetic
laws
of
literary
and
artistic
classes
v
analogous
errors
in
historic
and
logic
the
better
to
confirm
these
criticisms
it
will
be
opportune
to
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
analogous
and
opposite
errors
born
of
ignorance
as
to
the
true
nature
of
art
and
of
its
relation
to
history
and
to
science
these
errors
have
injured
alike
the
theory
of
history
and
of
science
of
historic
or
historiology
and
of
logic
sidenote
of
the
philosophy
of
historical
intellectualism
has
been
the
cause
of
the
many
researches
which
have
been
made
especially
during
the
last
two
centuries
researches
which
continue
for
philosophy
of
for
an
for
a
for
a
or
however
may
be
otherwise
entitled
or
described
a
science
whose
object
is
to
extract
from
history
universal
laws
and
concepts
of
what
kind
must
be
these
laws
these
universals
historical
laws
and
historical
concepts
in
that
case
an
elementary
criticism
of
knowledge
suffices
to
make
clear
the
absurdity
of
the
attempt
when
such
expressions
as
a
a
are
not
simply
metaphors
colloquially
employed
they
are
true
contradictions
in
terms
the
adjective
is
as
unsuitable
to
the
substantive
as
in
the
expressions
or
history
means
concretion
and
individuality
law
and
concept
mean
abstraction
and
universality
if
on
the
other
hand
the
attempt
to
draw
from
history
historical
laws
and
concepts
be
abandoned
and
it
be
merely
desired
to
draw
from
it
laws
and
concepts
the
attempt
is
certainly
not
frivolous
but
the
science
thus
obtained
will
be
not
a
philosophy
of
history
but
rather
according
to
the
case
either
philosophy
in
its
various
specifications
of
ethic
logic
or
empirical
science
in
its
infinite
divisions
and
subdivisions
thus
are
sought
out
either
those
philosophical
concepts
which
are
as
has
already
been
observed
at
the
bottom
of
every
historical
construction
and
separate
perception
from
intuition
historical
intuition
from
pure
intuition
history
from
art
or
already
formed
historical
intuitions
are
collected
and
reduced
to
types
and
classes
which
is
exactly
the
method
of
the
natural
sciences
great
thinkers
have
sometimes
donned
the
unsuitable
cloak
of
the
philosophy
of
history
and
notwithstanding
the
covering
they
have
conquered
philosophical
truths
of
the
greatest
magnitude
the
cloak
has
been
dropped
the
truth
has
remained
modern
sociologists
are
rather
to
be
blamed
not
so
much
for
the
illusion
in
which
they
are
involved
when
they
talk
of
an
impossible
science
of
sociology
as
for
the
infecundity
which
almost
always
accompanies
their
illusion
it
is
but
a
small
evil
that
aesthetic
should
be
termed
sociological
aesthetic
or
logic
social
logic
the
grave
evil
is
that
their
aesthetic
is
an
expression
of
sensualism
their
logic
verbal
and
incoherent
the
philosophical
movement
to
which
we
have
referred
has
borne
two
good
fruits
in
relation
to
history
first
of
all
has
been
felt
the
desire
to
construct
a
theory
of
historiography
that
is
to
understand
the
nature
and
the
limits
of
history
a
theory
which
in
conformity
with
the
analyses
made
above
can
not
obtain
satisfaction
save
in
a
general
science
of
intuition
in
an
aesthetic
from
which
historic
would
be
separated
under
a
special
head
by
means
of
the
intervention
of
the
universals
furthermore
concrete
truths
relating
to
historical
events
have
often
been
expressed
beneath
the
false
and
presumptuous
cloak
of
a
philosophy
of
history
canons
and
empirical
advice
have
been
formulated
by
no
means
superfluous
to
students
and
critics
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
deny
this
utility
to
the
most
recent
of
philosophies
of
history
to
historical
materialism
which
has
thrown
a
very
vivid
light
upon
many
sides
of
social
life
formerly
neglected
or
ill
understood
sidenote
invasions
into
the
principle
of
authority
of
the
is
an
invasion
of
historicity
into
the
domains
of
science
and
philosophy
which
has
raged
in
the
schools
this
substitutes
for
introspection
and
philosophical
analyses
this
or
that
evidence
document
or
authoritative
statement
with
which
history
certainly
can
not
dispense
but
logic
the
science
of
thought
and
of
intellectual
knowledge
has
suffered
the
most
grave
and
destructive
disturbances
and
errors
of
all
through
the
imperfect
understanding
of
the
aesthetic
fact
how
indeed
could
it
be
otherwise
if
logical
activity
come
after
and
contain
in
itself
aesthetic
activity
an
inexact
aesthetic
must
of
necessity
drag
after
it
an
inexact
logic
whoever
opens
logical
treatises
from
the
of
aristotle
to
the
moderns
must
admit
that
they
all
contain
a
haphazard
mixture
of
verbal
facts
and
facts
of
thought
of
grammatical
forms
and
of
conceptual
forms
of
aesthetic
and
of
logic
not
that
attempts
have
been
wanting
to
escape
from
verbal
expression
and
to
seize
thought
in
its
effective
nature
aristotelian
logic
itself
did
not
become
mere
syllogistic
and
verbalism
without
some
stumbling
and
oscillation
the
especially
logical
problem
was
often
touched
upon
in
the
middle
ages
by
the
nominalists
realists
and
conceptualists
in
their
disputes
with
galileo
and
with
bacon
the
natural
sciences
gave
an
honourable
place
to
induction
vico
combated
formalist
and
mathematical
logic
in
favour
of
inventive
methods
kant
called
attention
to
syntheses
the
absolute
idealists
despised
the
aristotelian
logic
the
followers
of
herbart
bound
to
aristotle
on
the
other
hand
set
in
relief
those
judgments
which
they
called
narrative
which
are
of
a
character
altogether
different
from
other
logical
judgments
finally
the
linguists
insisted
upon
the
irrationality
of
the
word
in
relation
to
the
concept
but
a
conscious
sure
and
radical
movement
of
reform
can
find
no
base
or
save
in
the
science
of
aesthetic
sidenote
in
its
in
a
logic
suitably
reformed
on
this
basis
it
will
be
fitting
to
proclaim
before
all
things
this
truth
and
to
draw
from
it
all
its
consequences
the
logical
fact
only
logical
is
the
universal
the
spirit
that
forms
and
in
so
far
as
it
forms
the
universal
and
if
be
understood
by
induction
as
has
sometimes
been
understood
the
formation
of
universals
and
by
deduction
the
verbal
development
of
these
then
it
is
clear
that
true
logic
can
be
nothing
but
inductive
logic
but
since
by
the
word
deduction
has
been
more
frequently
understood
the
special
processes
of
mathematics
and
by
the
word
induction
those
of
the
natural
sciences
it
will
be
advisable
to
avoid
the
one
and
the
other
denomination
and
to
say
that
true
logic
is
the
logic
of
the
concept
the
logic
of
the
concept
adopting
a
method
which
is
at
once
induction
and
deduction
will
adopt
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
exclusively
that
is
will
adopt
the
speculative
method
which
is
intrinsic
to
it
the
concept
the
universal
is
in
itself
abstractly
considered
no
word
is
proper
to
it
so
true
is
this
that
the
logical
concept
remains
always
the
same
notwithstanding
the
variation
of
verbal
forms
in
respect
to
the
concept
expression
is
a
simple
or
there
must
be
an
expression
it
can
not
fail
but
what
it
is
to
be
this
or
that
is
determined
by
the
historical
and
psychological
conditions
of
the
individual
who
is
speaking
the
quality
of
the
expression
is
not
deducible
from
the
nature
of
the
concept
there
does
not
exist
a
true
logical
sense
of
words
he
who
forms
a
concept
bestows
on
each
occasion
their
true
meaning
on
the
words
sidenote
between
logical
and
this
being
established
the
only
truly
logical
that
is
propositions
the
only
rigorously
logical
judgments
can
be
nothing
but
those
whose
proper
and
exclusive
content
is
the
determination
of
a
concept
these
propositions
or
judgments
are
the
science
itself
is
nothing
but
a
complex
of
definitions
unified
in
a
supreme
definition
a
system
of
concepts
or
chief
concept
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
exclude
from
logic
all
those
propositions
which
do
not
affirm
universals
narrative
judgments
not
less
than
those
termed
by
aristotle
such
as
the
expression
of
desires
are
not
properly
logical
judgments
they
are
either
purely
aesthetic
propositions
or
historical
propositions
peter
is
passing
it
is
raining
i
am
sleepy
i
want
to
read
these
and
an
infinity
of
propositions
of
the
same
kind
are
nothing
but
either
a
mere
enclosing
in
words
the
impression
of
the
fact
that
peter
is
passing
of
the
falling
rain
of
my
organism
inclining
to
sleep
and
of
my
will
directed
to
reading
or
they
are
existential
affirmation
concerning
those
facts
they
are
expressions
of
the
real
or
of
the
unreal
of
historical
or
of
pure
imagination
they
are
certainly
not
definitions
of
universals
sidenote
this
exclusion
can
not
meet
with
great
difficulties
it
is
already
almost
an
accomplished
fact
and
the
only
thing
required
is
to
render
it
explicit
decisive
and
coherent
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
all
that
part
of
human
experience
which
is
called
consisting
of
judgments
and
reasonings
which
are
based
on
concepts
what
is
syllogistic
is
it
to
be
looked
down
upon
from
above
with
contempt
as
something
useless
as
has
so
often
been
done
in
the
reaction
of
the
humanists
against
scholasticism
in
absolute
idealism
in
the
enthusiastic
admiration
of
our
times
for
the
methods
of
observation
and
experiment
of
the
natural
sciences
syllogistic
reasoning
is
not
a
discovery
of
truth
it
is
the
art
of
exposing
debating
disputing
with
oneself
and
others
proceeding
from
concepts
already
formed
from
facts
already
observed
and
making
appeal
to
the
persistence
of
the
true
or
of
thought
such
is
the
meaning
of
the
principle
of
identity
and
contradiction
it
infers
consequences
from
these
data
that
is
it
represents
what
has
already
been
discovered
therefore
if
it
be
an
per
from
the
point
of
view
of
invention
it
is
most
efficacious
as
a
teaching
and
an
exposition
to
reduce
affirmations
to
the
syllogistic
scheme
is
a
way
of
controlling
one
own
thought
and
of
criticizing
that
of
others
it
is
easy
to
laugh
at
syllogisers
but
if
syllogistic
has
been
born
and
retains
its
place
it
must
have
good
roots
of
its
own
satire
applied
to
it
can
concern
only
its
abuses
such
as
the
attempt
to
prove
syllogistically
questions
of
fact
observation
and
intuition
or
the
neglect
of
profound
meditation
and
unprejudiced
investigation
of
problems
for
syllogistic
formality
and
if
can
sometimes
aid
us
in
our
attempt
to
remember
with
ease
to
manipulate
the
results
of
our
own
thought
let
us
welcome
this
form
of
the
syllogism
also
long
prophesied
by
leibnitz
and
essayed
by
many
even
in
our
days
but
precisely
because
syllogistic
is
the
art
of
exposing
and
of
debating
its
theory
can
not
hold
the
first
place
in
a
philosophical
logic
usurping
that
belonging
to
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
which
is
the
central
and
dominating
doctrine
to
which
is
reduced
everything
logical
in
syllogistic
without
leaving
a
residuum
relations
of
concepts
subordination
identification
and
so
on
nor
must
it
ever
be
forgotten
that
the
concept
the
logical
judgment
and
the
syllogism
do
not
occupy
the
same
position
the
first
alone
is
the
logical
fact
the
second
and
third
are
the
forms
in
which
the
first
manifests
itself
these
in
so
far
as
they
are
forms
can
not
be
examined
save
aesthetically
grammatically
in
so
far
as
they
possess
logical
content
only
by
neglecting
the
forms
themselves
and
passing
to
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
sidenote
logic
and
true
this
shows
the
truth
of
the
ordinary
remark
to
the
effect
that
he
who
reasons
ill
also
speaks
and
writes
ill
that
exact
logical
analysis
is
the
basis
of
good
expression
this
truth
is
a
tautology
for
to
reason
well
is
in
fact
to
express
oneself
well
because
the
expression
is
the
intuitive
possession
of
one
own
logical
thought
the
principle
of
contradiction
itself
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
the
aesthetic
principle
of
coherence
it
will
be
said
that
starting
from
erroneous
concepts
it
is
possible
to
write
and
to
speak
exceedingly
well
as
it
is
also
possible
to
reason
well
that
some
who
are
dull
at
research
may
yet
be
most
limpid
writers
that
is
precisely
because
to
write
well
depends
upon
having
a
clear
intuition
of
one
own
thought
even
if
it
be
erroneous
that
is
to
say
not
of
its
scientific
but
of
its
aesthetic
truth
since
it
is
this
truth
itself
a
philosopher
like
schopenhauer
can
imagine
that
art
is
a
representation
of
the
platonic
ideas
this
doctrine
is
absolutely
false
scientifically
yet
he
may
develop
this
false
knowledge
in
excellent
prose
aesthetically
most
true
but
we
have
already
replied
to
these
objections
when
we
observed
that
at
that
precise
point
where
a
speaker
or
a
writer
enunciates
an
concept
he
is
at
the
same
time
speaking
ill
and
writing
ill
he
may
however
afterwards
recover
himself
in
the
many
other
parts
of
his
thought
which
consist
of
true
propositions
not
connected
with
the
preceding
errors
and
lucid
expressions
may
with
him
follow
upon
turbid
expressions
sidenote
all
enquiries
as
to
the
forms
of
judgments
and
of
syllogisms
on
their
conversion
and
on
their
various
relations
which
still
encumber
treatises
on
logic
are
therefore
destined
to
become
less
to
be
transformed
to
be
reduced
to
something
else
the
doctrine
of
the
concept
and
of
the
organism
of
the
concepts
of
definition
of
system
of
philosophy
and
of
the
various
sciences
and
the
like
will
fill
the
place
of
these
and
will
constitute
the
only
true
and
proper
logic
those
who
first
had
some
suspicion
of
the
intimate
connexion
between
aesthetic
and
logic
and
conceived
aesthetic
as
a
of
sensible
were
strangely
addicted
to
applying
logical
categories
to
the
new
knowledge
talking
of
concepts
aesthetic
judgments
aesthetic
and
so
on
we
are
less
superstitious
as
regards
the
solidity
of
the
traditional
logic
of
the
schools
and
better
informed
as
to
the
nature
of
aesthetic
we
do
not
recommend
the
application
of
logic
to
aesthetic
but
the
liberation
of
logic
from
aesthetic
forms
these
have
given
rise
to
forms
or
categories
of
logic
due
to
the
following
of
altogether
arbitrary
and
crude
distinctions
logic
thus
reformed
will
always
be
logic
it
will
study
the
true
form
or
activity
of
thought
the
concept
excluding
single
and
particular
concepts
the
old
logic
is
ill
called
formal
it
were
better
to
call
it
or
formal
logic
will
drive
out
formalistic
logic
to
attain
this
object
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
have
recourse
as
some
have
done
to
a
real
or
material
logic
which
is
not
a
science
of
thought
but
thought
itself
in
the
act
not
only
a
logic
but
the
complex
of
philosophy
in
which
logic
also
is
included
the
science
of
thought
logic
is
that
of
the
concept
as
that
of
fancy
aesthetic
is
the
science
of
expression
the
of
both
sciences
lies
in
exactly
following
in
every
particular
the
distinction
between
the
two
domains
vi
theoretic
and
practical
activity
the
intuitive
and
intellective
forms
exhaust
as
we
have
said
all
the
theoretic
form
of
the
spirit
but
it
is
not
possible
to
know
them
thoroughly
nor
to
criticize
another
series
of
erroneous
aesthetic
theories
without
first
establishing
clearly
their
relations
with
another
form
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
form
sidenote
this
form
or
practical
activity
is
the
we
do
not
employ
this
word
here
in
the
sense
of
any
philosophical
system
in
which
the
will
is
the
foundation
of
the
universe
the
principle
of
things
and
the
true
reality
nor
do
we
employ
it
in
the
ample
sense
of
other
systems
which
understand
by
will
the
energy
of
the
spirit
the
spirit
or
activity
in
general
making
of
every
act
of
the
human
spirit
an
act
of
will
neither
such
metaphysical
nor
such
metaphorical
meaning
is
ours
for
us
the
will
is
as
generally
accepted
that
activity
of
the
spirit
which
differs
from
the
mere
theoretical
contemplation
of
things
and
is
productive
not
of
knowledge
but
of
actions
action
is
really
action
in
so
far
as
it
is
voluntary
it
is
not
necessary
to
remark
that
in
the
will
to
do
is
included
in
the
scientific
sense
also
what
is
vulgarly
called
the
will
to
resist
to
reject
the
prometheutic
will
is
also
action
sidenote
will
as
an
ulterior
stage
in
respect
to
man
understands
things
with
the
theoretical
form
with
the
practical
form
he
changes
them
with
the
one
he
appropriates
the
universe
with
the
other
he
creates
it
but
the
first
form
is
the
basis
of
the
second
and
the
relation
of
which
we
have
already
found
existing
between
aesthetic
and
logical
activity
is
repeated
between
these
two
on
a
larger
scale
knowledge
independent
of
the
will
is
thinkable
will
independent
of
knowledge
is
unthinkable
blind
will
is
not
will
true
will
has
eyes
how
can
we
will
without
having
before
us
historical
intuitions
perceptions
of
objects
and
knowledge
of
logical
relations
which
enlighten
us
as
to
the
nature
of
those
objects
how
can
we
really
will
if
we
do
not
know
the
world
which
surrounds
us
and
the
manner
of
changing
things
by
acting
upon
them
sidenote
and
it
has
been
objected
that
men
of
action
practical
men
in
the
eminent
sense
are
the
least
disposed
to
contemplate
and
to
theorize
their
energy
is
not
delayed
in
contemplation
it
rushes
at
once
into
will
and
conversely
that
contemplative
men
philosophers
are
often
very
mediocre
in
practical
matters
weak
willed
and
therefore
neglected
and
thrust
aside
in
the
tumult
of
life
it
is
easy
to
see
that
these
distinctions
are
merely
empirical
and
quantitative
certainly
the
practical
man
has
no
need
of
a
philosophical
system
in
order
to
act
but
in
the
spheres
where
he
does
act
he
starts
from
intuitions
and
concepts
which
are
most
clear
to
him
otherwise
he
could
not
will
the
most
ordinary
actions
it
would
not
be
possible
to
will
to
feed
oneself
for
instance
without
knowledge
of
the
food
and
of
the
link
of
cause
and
effect
between
certain
movements
and
certain
organic
sensations
rising
gradually
to
the
more
complex
forms
of
action
for
example
to
the
political
how
could
we
will
anything
politically
good
or
bad
without
knowing
the
real
conditions
of
society
and
consequently
the
means
and
expedients
to
be
adopted
when
the
practical
man
feels
himself
in
the
dark
about
one
or
more
of
these
points
or
when
he
is
seized
with
doubt
action
either
does
not
begin
or
stops
it
is
then
that
the
theoretical
moment
which
in
the
rapid
succession
of
human
actions
is
hardly
noticed
and
rapidly
forgotten
becomes
important
and
occupies
consciousness
for
a
longer
time
and
if
this
moment
be
prolonged
then
the
practical
man
may
become
hamlet
divided
between
desire
for
action
and
his
small
amount
of
theoretical
clarity
as
regards
the
situation
and
the
means
to
be
employed
and
if
he
develop
a
taste
for
contemplation
and
discovery
and
leave
willing
and
acting
to
a
more
or
less
great
extent
to
others
there
is
formed
in
him
the
calm
disposition
of
the
artist
of
the
man
of
science
or
of
the
philosopher
who
are
sometimes
unpractical
or
altogether
blameworthy
these
observations
are
all
obvious
their
exactitude
can
not
be
denied
let
us
however
repeat
that
they
are
founded
on
quantitative
distinctions
and
do
not
disprove
but
confirm
the
fact
that
an
action
however
slight
it
be
can
not
really
be
an
action
that
is
an
action
that
is
willed
unless
it
be
preceded
by
cognoscitive
activity
sidenote
of
practical
judgments
or
judgments
of
some
psychologists
on
the
other
hand
place
before
practical
action
an
altogether
special
class
of
judgments
which
they
call
judgments
or
judgments
they
say
that
in
order
to
resolve
to
perform
an
action
it
is
necessary
to
have
judged
this
action
is
useful
this
action
is
good
and
at
first
sight
this
seems
to
have
the
testimony
of
consciousness
on
its
side
but
he
who
observes
better
and
analyses
with
greater
subtlety
discovers
that
such
judgments
follow
instead
of
preceding
the
affirmation
of
the
will
they
are
nothing
but
the
expression
of
the
already
exercised
volition
a
good
or
useful
action
is
an
action
that
is
willed
it
will
always
be
impossible
to
distil
from
the
objective
study
of
things
a
single
drop
of
usefulness
or
goodness
we
do
not
desire
things
because
we
know
them
to
be
good
or
useful
but
we
know
them
to
be
good
and
useful
because
we
desire
them
here
too
the
rapidity
with
which
the
facts
of
consciousness
follow
one
another
has
given
rise
to
an
illusion
practical
action
is
preceded
by
knowledge
but
not
by
practical
knowledge
or
better
by
the
practical
to
obtain
this
it
is
first
necessary
to
have
practical
action
the
third
moment
therefore
of
practical
judgments
or
judgments
of
value
is
altogether
imaginary
it
does
not
come
between
the
two
moments
or
degrees
of
theory
and
practice
that
is
why
there
exist
no
normative
sciences
in
general
which
regulate
or
command
discover
and
indicate
values
to
the
practical
activity
because
there
is
none
for
any
other
activity
assuming
every
science
already
realized
and
that
activity
developed
which
it
afterwards
takes
as
its
object
sidenote
of
the
practical
from
the
these
distinctions
established
we
must
condemn
as
erroneous
every
theory
which
confuses
aesthetic
with
practical
activity
or
introduces
the
laws
of
the
second
into
the
first
that
science
is
theory
and
art
practice
has
been
many
times
affirmed
those
who
make
this
statement
and
look
upon
the
aesthetic
fact
as
a
practical
fact
do
not
do
so
capriciously
or
because
they
are
groping
in
the
void
but
because
they
have
their
eye
on
something
which
is
really
practical
but
the
practical
which
they
are
looking
at
is
not
aesthetic
nor
within
aesthetic
it
is
and
beside
and
although
they
are
often
found
united
they
are
not
necessarily
united
that
is
to
say
by
the
bond
of
identity
of
nature
the
aesthetic
fact
is
altogether
completed
in
the
expressive
elaboration
of
the
impressions
when
we
have
conquered
the
word
within
us
conceived
definitely
and
vividly
a
figure
or
a
statue
or
found
a
musical
motive
expression
is
born
and
is
complete
there
is
no
need
for
anything
else
if
after
this
we
should
open
our
mouths
and
to
open
them
to
speak
or
our
throats
to
sing
and
declare
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
extended
throat
what
we
have
completely
said
or
sung
to
ourselves
or
if
we
should
stretch
out
and
to
stretch
out
our
hands
to
touch
the
notes
of
the
piano
or
to
take
up
the
brushes
and
the
chisel
making
thus
in
detail
those
movements
which
we
have
already
done
rapidly
and
doing
so
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
more
or
less
durable
traces
this
is
all
an
addition
a
fact
which
obeys
quite
different
laws
to
the
first
and
with
these
laws
we
have
not
to
occupy
ourselves
for
the
moment
let
us
however
here
recognize
that
this
second
movement
is
a
production
of
things
a
fact
or
a
fact
of
it
is
customary
to
distinguish
the
internal
from
the
external
work
of
art
the
terminology
seems
here
to
be
infelicitous
for
the
work
of
art
the
aesthetic
work
is
always
and
that
which
is
called
is
no
longer
a
work
of
art
others
distinguish
between
fact
and
fact
meaning
by
the
second
the
external
or
practical
stage
which
may
and
generally
does
follow
the
first
but
in
this
case
it
is
simply
a
case
of
linguistic
usage
doubtless
permissible
although
perhaps
not
opportune
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
end
of
art
and
of
the
choice
of
the
for
the
same
reasons
the
search
for
the
of
is
ridiculous
when
it
is
understood
of
art
as
art
and
since
to
fix
an
end
is
to
choose
the
theory
that
the
content
of
art
must
be
is
another
form
of
the
same
error
a
selection
from
among
impressions
and
sensations
implies
that
these
are
already
expressions
otherwise
how
can
a
selection
be
made
among
what
is
continuous
and
indistinct
to
choose
is
to
will
to
will
this
and
not
to
will
that
and
this
and
that
must
be
before
us
they
must
be
expressed
practice
follows
it
does
not
precede
theory
expression
is
free
inspiration
the
true
artist
in
fact
finds
himself
big
with
his
theme
he
knows
not
how
he
feels
the
moment
of
birth
drawing
near
but
he
can
not
will
it
or
not
will
it
if
he
were
to
wish
to
act
in
opposition
to
his
inspiration
to
make
an
arbitrary
choice
if
born
anacreon
he
were
to
wish
to
sing
of
atreus
and
of
alcides
his
lyre
would
warn
him
of
his
mistake
echoing
only
of
venus
and
of
love
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
sidenote
innocence
of
the
theme
or
content
can
not
therefore
be
practically
or
morally
charged
with
epithets
of
praise
or
of
blame
when
critics
of
art
remark
that
a
theme
is
in
cases
where
that
observation
has
a
just
foundation
it
is
a
question
of
blaming
not
the
selection
of
the
theme
which
would
be
absurd
but
the
manner
in
which
the
artist
has
treated
it
the
expression
has
failed
owing
to
the
contradictions
which
it
contains
and
when
the
same
critics
rebel
against
the
theme
or
the
content
as
being
unworthy
of
art
and
blameworthy
in
respect
to
works
which
they
proclaim
to
be
artistically
perfect
if
these
expressions
really
are
perfect
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
advise
the
critics
to
leave
the
artists
in
peace
for
they
can
not
get
inspiration
save
from
what
has
made
an
impression
upon
them
the
critics
should
think
rather
of
how
they
can
effect
changes
in
nature
and
in
society
in
order
that
those
impressions
may
not
exist
if
ugliness
were
to
vanish
from
the
world
if
universal
virtue
and
felicity
were
established
there
perhaps
artists
would
no
longer
represent
perverse
or
pessimistic
sentiments
but
sentiments
that
are
calm
innocent
and
joyous
like
arcadians
of
a
real
arcady
but
so
long
as
ugliness
and
turpitude
exist
in
nature
and
impose
themselves
on
the
artist
it
is
not
possible
to
prevent
the
expression
of
these
things
also
and
when
it
has
arisen
infectum
fieri
we
speak
thus
entirely
from
the
aesthetic
point
of
view
and
from
that
of
pure
aesthetic
criticism
we
do
not
delay
to
pass
here
in
review
the
damage
which
the
criticism
of
choice
does
to
artistic
production
with
the
prejudices
which
it
produces
or
maintains
among
the
artists
themselves
and
with
the
contrast
which
it
occasions
between
artistic
impulse
and
critical
exigencies
it
is
true
that
sometimes
it
seems
to
do
some
good
also
by
assisting
the
artists
to
discover
themselves
that
is
their
own
impressions
and
their
own
inspiration
and
to
acquire
consciousness
of
the
task
which
is
as
it
were
imposed
upon
them
by
the
historical
moment
in
which
they
live
and
by
their
individual
temperament
in
these
cases
criticism
of
choice
merely
recognizes
and
aids
the
expressions
which
are
already
being
formed
it
believes
itself
to
be
the
mother
where
at
most
it
is
only
the
midwife
sidenote
independence
of
the
impossibility
of
choice
of
content
completes
the
theorem
of
the
of
and
is
also
the
only
legitimate
meaning
of
the
expression
for
art
art
is
thus
independent
of
science
as
it
is
of
the
useful
and
the
moral
let
it
not
be
feared
that
thus
may
be
justified
art
that
is
frivolous
or
cold
since
that
which
is
truly
frivolous
or
cold
is
so
because
it
has
not
been
raised
to
expression
or
in
other
words
frivolity
and
frigidity
come
always
from
the
form
of
the
aesthetic
elaboration
from
the
lack
of
a
content
not
from
the
material
qualities
of
the
content
sidenote
of
the
saying
the

is
the
can
also
not
be
completely
criticized
save
by
starting
from
the
distinction
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
and
from
the
theoretic
character
of
the
aesthetic
activity
man
is
not
simply
knowledge
and
contemplation
he
is
also
will
which
contains
in
it
the
cognoscitive
moment
now
the
saying
is
either
altogether
void
as
when
it
is
understood
that
the
man
is
the
style
in
so
far
as
he
is
style
that
is
to
say
the
man
but
only
in
so
far
as
he
is
an
expression
of
activity
or
it
is
erroneous
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
deduce
from
what
a
man
has
seen
and
expressed
that
which
he
has
done
and
willed
inferring
thereby
that
there
is
a
necessary
link
between
knowing
and
willing
many
legends
in
the
biographies
of
artists
have
sprung
from
this
erroneous
identification
since
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
man
who
gives
expression
to
generous
sentiments
should
not
be
a
noble
and
generous
man
in
practical
life
or
that
the
dramatist
who
gives
a
great
many
stabs
in
his
plays
should
not
himself
have
given
a
few
at
least
in
real
life
vainly
do
the
artists
protest
est
nobis
pagina
vita
they
are
merely
taxed
in
addition
with
lying
and
hypocrisy
o
you
poor
women
of
verona
how
far
more
subtle
you
were
when
you
founded
your
belief
that
dante
had
really
descended
to
hell
upon
his
dusky
countenance
yours
was
at
any
rate
a
historical
conjecture
sidenote
of
the
concept
of
sincerity
in
finally
imposed
upon
the
artist
as
a
duty
this
law
of
ethics
which
they
say
is
also
a
law
of
aesthetic
arises
from
another
equivoke
for
by
sincerity
is
meant
either
the
moral
duty
not
to
deceive
one
neighbour
and
in
that
case
is
foreign
to
the
artist
for
he
in
fact
deceives
no
one
since
he
gives
form
to
what
is
already
in
his
mind
he
would
deceive
only
if
he
were
to
betray
his
duty
as
an
artist
by
a
lesser
devotion
to
the
intrinsic
necessity
of
his
task
if
lies
and
deceit
are
in
his
mind
then
the
form
which
he
gives
to
these
things
can
not
be
deceit
or
lies
precisely
because
it
is
aesthetic
the
artist
if
he
be
a
charlatan
a
liar
or
a
miscreant
purifies
his
other
self
by
reflecting
it
in
art
or
by
sincerity
is
meant
fulness
and
truth
of
expression
and
it
is
clear
that
this
second
sense
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ethical
concept
the
law
which
is
at
once
ethical
and
aesthetic
reveals
itself
in
this
case
in
a
word
employed
alike
by
ethic
and
aesthetic
vii
analogy
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical

two
forms
of

the

activity
aesthetic
and

has
an
important
parallel
in
the
practical

which
has
not
yet
been
placed
in
due
relief
the
practical
activity
is
also
divided
into
a
first
and
second
degree
the
second
implying
the
first
the
first
practical
degree
is
the
simply
or
activity
the
second
the

economy
is
as
it
were
the

of
practical
life
morality
its
logic
sidenote
economically
if
this
has
not
been
clearly
seen
by
philosophers
if
its
suitable
place
in
the
system
of
the
mind
has
not
been
given
to
the
economic
activity
and
it
has
been
left
to
wander
in
the
prolegomena
to
treatises
on
political
economy
often
uncertain
and
but
slightly
elaborated
this
is
due
among
other
reasons
to
the
fact
that
the
useful
or
economic
has
been
confused
now
with
the
concept
of
now
with
that
of
the
sidenote
between
the
useful
and
the
is
certainly
not
a
special
activity
of
the
spirit
technique
is
knowledge
or
better
it
is
knowledge
itself
in
general
that
takes
this
name
as
we
have
seen
in
so
far
as
it
serves
as
basis
for
practical
action
knowledge
which
is
not
followed
or
is
presumed
to
be
not
easily
followed
by
practical
action
is
called
pure
the
same
knowledge
if
effectively
followed
by
action
is
called
applied
if
it
is
presumed
that
it
can
be
easily
followed
by
the
same
action
it
is
called
technical
or
applied
this
word
then
indicates
a
in
which
knowledge
already
is
or
easily
can
be
found
not
a
special
form
of
knowledge
so
true
is
this
that
it
would
be
altogether
impossible
to
establish
whether
a
given
order
of
knowledge
were
intrinsically
pure
or
applied
all
knowledge
however
abstract
and
philosophical
one
may
imagine
it
to
be
can
be
a
guide
to
practical
acts
a
theoretical
error
in
the
ultimate
principles
of
morals
can
be
reflected
and
always
is
reflected
in
some
way
in
practical
life
one
can
only
speak
roughly
and
unscientifically
of
truths
that
are
pure
and
of
others
that
are
applied
the
same
knowledge
which
is
called
technical
can
also
be
called
but
the
word
useful
in
conformity
with
the
criticism
of
judgments
of
value
made
above
is
to
be
understood
as
used
here
in
a
linguistic
or
metaphorical
sense
when
we
say
that
water
is
useful
for
putting
out
fire
the
word
useful
is
used
in
a
sense
water
thrown
on
the
fire
is
the
cause
of
its
going
out
this
is
the
knowledge
that
serves
for
basis
to
the
action
let
us
say
of
firemen
there
is
a
link
not
of
nature
but
of
simple
succession
between
the
useful
action
of
the
person
who
extinguishes
the
conflagration
and
this

useful
sidenote
between
the
useful
and
the
some
economists
identify
utility
with
that
is
to
say
with
merely
economical
action
or
desire
with
that
which
is
profitable
to
the
individual
in
so
far
as
individual
without
regard
to
and
indeed
in
complete
opposition
to
the
moral
law
the
egoistic
is
the
immoral
in
this
case
economy
would
be
a
very
strange
science
standing
not
beside
but
facing
ethic
like
the
devil
facing
god
or
at
least
like
the
in
the
processes
of
canonization
such
a
conception
of
it
is
altogether
inadmissible
the
science
of
immorality
is
implied
in
that
of
morality
as
the
science
of
the
false
is
implied
in
the
science
of
the
true
and
a
science
of
ineffectual
expression
in
aesthetic
the
science
of
successful
expression
if
then
economy
were
the
scientific
treatment
of
egoism
it
would
be
a
chapter
of
ethic
or
ethic
itself
because
every
moral
determination
implies
at
the
same
time
a
negation
of
its
contrary
further
conscience
tells
us
that
to
conduct
oneself
economically
is
not
to
conduct
oneself
egoistically
that
even
the
most
morally
scrupulous
man
must
conduct
himself
usefully
economically
if
he
does
not
wish
to
be
inconclusive
and
therefore
not
truly
moral
if
utility
were
egoism
how
could
it
be
the
duty
of
the
altruist
to
behave
like
an
egoist
sidenote
will
and
moral
if
we
are
not
mistaken
the
difficulty
is
solved
in
a
manner
perfectly
analogous
to
that
in
which
is
solved
the
problem
of
the
relations
between
the
expression
and
the
concept
between
aesthetic
and
logic
to
will
economically
is
to
an
to
will
morally
is
to
the
rational
but
whoever
wills
and
acts
morally
can
not
but
will
and
act
usefully
economically
how
could
he
will
the
unless
he
willed
it
also
his
particular
sidenote
the
reciprocal
is
not
true
as
it
is
not
true
in
aesthetic
science
that
the
expressive
fact
must
of
necessity
be
linked
with
the
logical
fact
it
is
possible
to
will
economically
without
willing
morally
and
it
is
possible
to
conduct
oneself
with
perfect
economic
coherence
while
pursuing
an
end
which
is
objectively
irrational
immoral
or
better
an
end
which
would
be
so
judged
in
a
superior
grade
of
consciousness
examples
of
the
economic
without
the
moral
character
are
the
prince
of
machiavelli
caesar
borgia
or
the
iago
of
shakespeare
who
can
help
admiring
their
strength
of
will
although
their
activity
is
only
economic
and
is
opposed
to
what
we
hold
moral
who
can
help
admiring
the
ser
ciappelletto
of
boccaccio
who
even
on
his
pursues
and
realizes
his
ideal
of
the
perfect
rascal
making
the
small
and
timid
little
thieves
who
are
present
at
his
burlesque
confession
exclaim
what
manner
of
man
is
this
whose
perversity
neither
age
nor
infirmity
nor
the
fear
of
death
which
he
sees
at
hand
nor
the
fear
of
god
before
whose
he
must
stand
in
a
little
while
have
been
able
to
remove
nor
to
cause
that
he
should
not
wish
to
die
as
he
has
lived
sidenote
economic
side
of
the
moral
man
unites
with
the
pertinacity
and
fearlessness
of
a
caesar
borgia
of
an
iago
or
of
a
ser
ciappelletto
the
good
will
of
the
saint
or
of
the
hero
or
better
good
will
would
not
be
will
and
consequently
not
good
if
it
did
not
possess
in
addition
to
the
side
which
makes
it
also
that
which
makes
it
thus
a
logical
thought
which
does
not
succeed
in
expressing
itself
is
not
thought
but
at
the
most
a
confused
presentiment
of
a
thought
yet
to
come
it
is
not
correct
then
to
conceive
of
the
amoral
man
as
also
the
man
or
to
make
of
morality
an
element
of
coherence
in
the
acts
of
life
and
therefore
of
economicity
nothing
prevents
us
from
conceiving
an
hypothesis
which
is
verified
at
least
during
certain
periods
and
moments
if
not
during
whole
lifetimes
a
man
altogether
without
moral
conscience
in
a
man
thus
organized
what
for
us
is
immorality
is
not
so
for
him
because
it
is
not
so
felt
the
consciousness
of
the
contradiction
between
what
is
desired
as
a
rational
end
and
what
is
pursued
egoistically
can
not
be
born
in
him
this
contradiction
is
immoral
conduct
becomes
also
only
in
the
man
who
possesses
moral
conscience
the
moral
remorse
which
is
the
proof
of
this
is
also
economical
remorse
that
is
to
say
pain
at
not
having
known
how
to
will
completely
and
to
attain
to
that
moral
ideal
which
was
willed
at
the
first
moment
but
was
afterwards
perverted
by
the
passions
meliora
proboque
deteriora
the
and
the
are
here
an
initial
will
immediately
contradicted
and
passed
over
in
the
man
deprived
of
moral
sense
we
must
admit
a
remorse
which
is
like
that
of
a
thief
or
of
an
assassin
who
should
be
attacked
when
on
the
point
of
robbing
or
of
assassinating
and
should
abstain
from
doing
so
not
owing
to
a
conversion
of
his
being
but
owing
to
his
impressionability
and
bewilderment
or
even
owing
to
a
momentary
awakening
of
the
moral
consciousness
when
he
has
come
back
to
himself
that
thief
or
assassin
will
regret
and
be
ashamed
of
his
inconsequence
his
remorse
will
not
be
due
to
having
done
wrong
but
to
not
having
done
it
his
remorse
is
therefore
economic
not
moral
since
the
latter
is
excluded
by
hypothesis
however
a
lively
moral
conscience
is
generally
found
among
the
majority
of
men
and
its
total
absence
is
a
rare
and
perhaps
monstrosity
it
may
therefore
be
admitted
that
morality
coincides
with
economicity
in
the
conduct
of
life
sidenote
merely
economic
and
the
error
of
the
morally
there
need
be
no
fear
lest
the
parallelism
affirmed
by
us
should
introduce
afresh
into
the
category
of
the
of
that
which
is
in
truth
action
and
volition
but
is
neither
moral
nor
immoral
the
category
in
sum
of
the
and
of
the
which
has
always
been
the
cause
or
mirror
of
ethical
corruption
as
is
the
case
with
jesuitical
morality
in
which
it
dominated
it
remains
quite
certain
that
indifferent
moral
actions
do
not
exist
because
moral
activity
pervades
and
must
pervade
every
least
volitional
movement
of
man
but
this
far
from
upsetting
the
parallelism
confirms
it
do
there
exist
intuitions
which
science
and
the
intellect
do
not
pervade
and
analyse
resolving
them
into
universal
concepts
or
changing
them
into
historical
affirmations
we
have
already
seen
that
true
science
philosophy
knows
no
external
limits
which
bar
its
way
as
happens
with
the
natural
sciences
science
and
morality
entirely
dominate
the
one
the
aesthetic
intuitions
the
other
the
economic
volitions
of
man
although
neither
of
them
can
appear
in
the
concrete
save
in
the
intuitive
form
as
regards
the
one
in
the
economic
as
regards
the
other
sidenote
of
utilitarianism
and
the
reform
of
ethic
and
of
this
combined
identity
and
difference
of
the
useful
and
of
the
moral
of
the
economic
and
of
the
ethic
explains
the
fortune
enjoyed
now
and
formerly
by
the
utilitarian
theory
of
ethic
it
is
in
fact
easy
to
discover
and
to
show
a
utilitarian
side
in
every
moral
action
as
it
is
easy
to
show
an
aesthetic
side
of
every
logical
proposition
the
criticism
of
ethical
utilitarianism
can
not
escape
by
denying
this
truth
and
seeking
out
absurd
and
inexistent
examples
of
moral
actions
it
must
admit
the
utilitarian
side
and
explain
it
as
the
concrete
form
of
morality
which
consists
of
what
is
this
form
utilitarians
do
not
see
this
within
this
is
not
the
place
for
a
more
ample
development
of
such
ideas
ethic
and
economic
can
not
but
be
gainers
as
we
have
said
of
logic
and
aesthetic
by
a
more
exact
determination
of
the
relations
that
exist
between
them
economic
science
is
now
rising
to
the
animating
concept
of
the
useful
as
it
strives
to
pass
beyond
the
mathematical
phase
in
which
it
is
still
entangled
a
phase
which
when
it
superseded
historicism
was
in
its
turn
a
progress
destroying
a
series
of
arbitrary
distinctions
and
false
theories
of
economic

in
the
confusion
of
the
theoretical
with
the
historical
with
this
conception
it
will
be
easy
on
the
one
hand
to
absorb
and
to
verify
the
theories
of
pure
economy
and
on
the
other
by
the
introduction
of
successive
complications
and
additions
and
by
passing
from
the
philosophical
to
the
empirical
or
naturalistic
method
to
include
the
particular
theories
of
the
political
or
national
economy

perhaps
defines
the
essence
of

with
the
least
impropriety

of

sidenote
system
of
the
in
this
summary
sketch
that
we
have
given
of
the
entire
philosophy
of
the
spirit
in
its
fundamental
moments
the
spirit
is
conceived
as
consisting
of
four
moments
or
grades
disposed
in
such
a
way
that
the
theoretical
activity
is
to
the
practical
as
is
the
first
theoretical
grade
to
the
second
theoretical
and
the
first
practical
grade
to
the
second
practical
the
four
moments
imply
one
another
regressively
by
their
concretion
the
concept
can
not
be
without
expression
the
useful
without
the
one
and
the
other
and
morality
without
the
three
preceding
grades
if
the
aesthetic
fact
is
alone
independent
and
the
others
more
or
less
dependent
then
the
logical
is
the
least
so
and
the
moral
will
the
most
moral
intention
operates
on
given
theoretic
bases
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
save
by
that
absurd
practice
the
jesuitical
of
here
people
pretend
to
themselves
not
to
know
what
at
bottom
they
know
perfectly
well
sidenote
forms
of
if
the
forms
of
human
activity
are
four
four
also
are
the
forms
of
genius
geniuses
in
art
in
science
in
moral
will
or
heroes
have
certainly
always
been
recognized
but
the
genius
of
pure
economic
has
met
with
opposition
it
is
not
altogether
without
reason
that
a
category
of
bad
geniuses
or
of
of
has
been
created
the
practical
merely
economic
genius
which
is
not
directed
to
a
rational
end
can
not
but
excite
an
admiration
mingled
with
alarm
it
would
be
a
mere
question
of
words
were
we
to
discuss
whether
the
word
genius
should
be
applied
only
to
creators
of
aesthetic
expression
or
also
to
men
of
scientific
research
and
of
action
to
observe
on
the
other
hand
that
genius
of
whatever
kind
it
be
is
always
a
quantitative
conception
and
an
empirical
distinction
would
be
to
repeat
what
has
already
been
explained
as
regards
artistic
genius
sidenote
of
a
fifth
form
of
activity
law
a
fifth
form
of
spiritual
activity
does
not
exist
it
would
be
easy
to
demonstrate
how
all
the
other
forms
either
do
not
possess
the
character
of
activity
or
are
verbal
variants
of
the
activities
already
examined
or
are
complex
and
derived
facts
in
which
the
various
activities
are
mingled
or
are
filled
with
special
contents
and
contingent
data
the
fact
for
example
considered
as
what
is
called
objective
law
is
derived
both
from
the
economic
and
from
the
logical
activities
law
is
a
rule
a
formula
whether
oral
or
written
matters
little
here
in
which
is
contained
an
economic
relation
willed
by
an
individual
or
by
a
collectivity
this
economic
side
at
once
unites
it
with
and
distinguishes
it
from
moral
activity
take
another
example
sociology
among
the
many
meanings
the
word
bears
in
our
times
is
sometimes
conceived
as
the
study
of
an
original
element
which
is
called
now
what
is
it
that
distinguishes
sociality
or
the
relations
which
are
developed
in
a
meeting
of
men
not
of
subhuman
beings
if
it
be
not
just
the
various
spiritual
activities
which
exist
among
the
former
and
which
are
supposed
not
to
exist
or
to
exist
only
in
a
rudimentary
degree
among
the
latter
sociality
then
far
from
being
an
original
simple
irreducible
conception
is
very
complex
and
complicated
this
could
be
proved
by
the
impossibility
generally
recognized
of
enunciating
a
single
sociological
law
properly
those
that
are
improperly
called
by
that
name
are
revealed
as
either
empirical
historical
observations
or
spiritual
laws
that
is
to
say
judgments
into
which
are
translated
the
conceptions
of
the
spiritual
activities
when
they
are
not
simply
empty
and
indeterminate
generalizations
like
the
law
of
evolution
sometimes
too
nothing
more
is
understood
by
sociality
than
social
rule
and
so
law
and
thus
sociology
is
confounded
with
the
science
or
theory
of
law
itself
law
sociality
and
like
terms
are
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
mode
analogous
to
that
employed
by
us
in
the
consideration
of
historicity
and
technique
sidenote
it
may
seem
fitting
to
form
a
different
judgment
as
to
activity
but
religion
is
nothing
but
knowledge
and
does
not
differ
from
its
other
forms
and
subforms
for
it
is
in
truth
and
in
turn
either
the
expression
of
practical
and
ideal
aspirations
religious
ideals
or
historical
narrative
legend
or
conceptual
science
dogma
it
can
therefore
be
maintained
with
equal
truth
both
that
religion
is
destroyed
by
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
and
that
it
is
always
present
there
their
religion
was
the
whole
patrimony
of
knowledge
of
primitive
peoples
our
patrimony
of
knowledge
is
our
religion
the
content
has
been
changed
bettered
refined
and
it
will
change
and
become
better
and
more
refined
in
the
future
also
but
its
function
is
always
the
same
we
do
not
know
what
use
could
be
made
of
religion
by
those
who
wish
to
preserve
it
side
by
side
with
the
theoretic
activity
of
man
with
his
art
with
his
criticism
and
with
his
philosophy
it
is
impossible
to
preserve
an
imperfect
and
inferior
kind
of
knowledge
like
religion
side
by
side
with
what
has
surpassed
and
disproved
it
catholicism
which
is
always
coherent
will
not
tolerate
a
science
a
history
an
ethic
in
contradiction
to
its
views
and
doctrines
the
rationalists
are
less
coherent
they
are
disposed
to
allow
a
little
space
in
their
souls
for
a
religion
which
is
in
contradiction
with
their
whole
theoretic
world
these
affectations
and
religious
susceptibilities
of
the
rationalists
of
our
times
have
their
origin
in
the
superstitious
cult
of
the
natural
sciences
these
as
we
know
and
as
is
confessed
by
the
mouth
of
their
chief
adepts
are
all
surrounded
by
science
having
been
wrongly
identified
with
the
natural
sciences
it
could
be
foreseen
that
the
remainder
would
be
asked
of
religion
that
remainder
with
which
the
human
spirit
can
not
dispense
we
are
therefore
indebted
to
materialism
to
positivism
to
naturalism
for
this
unhealthy
and
often
disingenuous
reflowering
of
religious
exaltation
such
things
are
the
business
of
the
hospital
when
they
are
not
the
business
of
the
politician
sidenote
philosophy
withdraws
from
religion
all
reason
for
existing
because
it
substitutes
itself
for
religion
as
the
science
of
the
spirit
it
looks
upon
religion
as
a
phenomenon
a
transitory
historical
fact
a
psychic
condition
that
can
be
surpassed
philosophy
shares
the
domain
of
knowledge
with
the
natural
disciplines
with
history
and
with
art
it
leaves
to
the
first
narration
measurement
and
classification
to
the
second
the
chronicling
of
what
has
individually
happened
to
the
third
the
individually
possible
there
is
nothing
left
to
share
with
religion
for
the
same
reason
philosophy
as
the
science
of
the
spirit
can
not
be
philosophy
of
the
intuitive
datum
nor
as
has
been
seen
of
history
nor
philosophy
of
and
therefore
there
can
not
be
a
philosophic
science
of
what
is
not
form
and
universal
but
material
and
particular
this
amounts
to
affirming
the
impossibility
of

the
philosophy
of

gnoseology

the
conceptions

it
be

to
affirm
the

and
classificatory
function

and
the

in
order
to
maintain
itself
side
by
side
with
the

of

spirit
metaphysic
has
been
obliged
to
assert
the
existence
of
a
specific
spiritual
activity
of
which
it
would
be
the
product
this
activity
which
in
antiquity
was
called
or
superior
and
in
modern
times
more
often
intellect
or
intellectual
would
unite
in
an
altogether
special
form
the
characters
of
imagination
and
of
intellect
it
would
provide
the
method
of
passing
by
deduction
or
dialectically
from
the
infinite
to
the
finite
from
form
to
matter
from
the
concept
to
the

from

to

operating
by
a
method
which
should
be
at
once
unity
and
compenetration
of
the
universal
and
the
particular
of
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
of
intuition
and
of
intellect
a
faculty
marvellous
indeed
and
delightful
to
possess
but
we
who
do
not
possess
it
have
no
means
of
proving
its
existence
sidenote
intellectual
intuition
has
sometimes
been
considered
as
the
true
aesthetic
activity
at
others
a
not
less
marvellous
aesthetic
activity
has
been
placed
beside
below
or
above
it
a
faculty
altogether
different
from
simple
intuition
the
glories
of
this
faculty
have
been
sung
and
to
it
have
been
attributed
the
fact
of
art
or
at
the
least
certain
groups
of
artistic
production
arbitrarily
chosen
art
religion
and
philosophy
have
seemed
in
turn
one
only
or
three
distinct
faculties
of
the
spirit
now
one
now
another
of
these
being
superior
in
the
dignity
assigned
to
each
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
various
attitudes
assumed
by
this
conception
of
aesthetic
which
we
will
call
we
are
here
in
the
kingdom
not
of
the
science
of
imagination
but
of
imagination
itself
which
creates
its
world
with
the
varying
elements
of
the
impressions
and
of
the
feelings
let
it
suffice
to
mention
that
this
mysterious
faculty
has
been
conceived
now
as
practical
now
as
a
mean
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
at
others
again
as
a
theoretic
grade
together
with
philosophy
and
religion
sidenote
and
immortality
of
the
immortality
of
art
has
sometimes
been
deduced
from
this
last
conception
as
belonging
with
its
sisters
to
the
sphere
of
absolute
spirit
at
other
times
on
the
other
hand
when
religion
has
been
looked
upon
as
mortal
and
as
dissolved
in
philosophy
then
the
mortality
even
the
actual
death
or
at
least
the
agony
of
art
has
been
proclaimed
these
questions
have
no
meaning
for
us
because
seeing
that
the
function
of
art
is
a
necessary
grade
of
the
spirit
to
ask
if
art
can
be
eliminated
is
the
same
thing
as
asking
if
sensation
or
intelligence
can
be
eliminated
but
metaphysic
in
the
above
sense
since
it
transplants
itself
to
an
arbitrary
world
is
not
to
be
criticized
in
detail
any
more
than
one
can
criticize
the
botany
of
the
garden
of
alcina
or
the
navigation
of
the
voyage
of
astolfo
criticism
can
only
be
made
by
refusing
to
join
the
game
that
is
to
say
by
rejecting
the
very
possibility
of
metaphysic
always
in
the
sense
above
indicated
as
we
do
not
admit
intellectual
intuition
in
philosophy
we
can
also
not
admit
its
shadow
or
equivalent
aesthetic
intellectual
intuition
or
any
other
mode
by
which
this
imaginary
function
may
be
called
and
represented
we
repeat
again
that
we
do
not
know
of
a
fifth
grade
beyond
the
four
grades
of
spirit
which
consciousness
reveals
to
us
ix
indivisibility
of
expression
into
modes
or
grades
and
critique
of
rhetoric
sidenote
characteristics
of
it
is
customary
to
give
long
enumerations
of
the
characteristics
of
art
having
reached
this
point
of
the
treatise
having
studied
the
artistic
function
as
spiritual
activity
as
theoretic
activity
and
as
special
theoretic
activity
intuitive
we
are
able
to
discern
that
those
various
and
copious
descriptions
mean
when
they
mean
anything
at
all
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
what
may
be
called
the
qualities
of
the
aesthetic
function
generic
specific
and
characteristic
to
the
first
of
these
are
referred
as
we
have
already
observed
the
characters
or
better
the
verbal
variants
of
and
of
in
those
also
of
of
and
so
on
to
the
second
of
these
the
characteristics
of
of
and
the
like
to
the
third
the
characteristics
of
of
of
of
of
of
the
words
may
vary
yet
more
but
they
will
not
contribute
anything
scientifically
new
the
results
which
we
have
shown
have
altogether
exhausted
the
analysis
of
expression
as
such
sidenote
of
modes
of
but
at
this
point
the
question
as
to
whether
there
be
various
or
of
expression
is
still
perfectly
legitimate
we
have
distinguished
two
grades
of
activity
each
of
which
is
subdivided
into
two
other
grades
and
there
is
certainly
so
far
no
visible
logical
reason
why
there
should
not
exist
two
or
more
modes
of
the
aesthetic
that
is
of
the
only
objection
is
that
these
modes
do
not
exist
for
the
present
at
least
it
is
a
question
of
simple
internal
observation
and
of
self
consciousness
one
may
scrutinize
aesthetic
facts
as
much
as
one
will
no
formal
differences
will
ever
be
found
among
them
nor
will
the
aesthetic
fact
be
divisible
into
a
first
and
a
second
degree
this
signifies
that
a
philosophical
classification
of
expressions
is
not
possible
single
expressive
facts
are
so
many
individuals
of
which
the
one
can
not
be
compared
with
the
other
save
generically
in
so
far
as
each
is
expression
to
use
the
language
of
the
schools
expression
is
a
species
which
can
not
in
its
turn
perform
the
functions
of
genus
impressions
that
is
to
say
contents
vary
every
content
differs
from
every
other
content
because
nothing
in
life
repeats
itself
and
the
continuous
variation
of
contents
follows
the
irreducible
variety
of
expressive
facts
the
aesthetic
syntheses
of
the
impressions
sidenote
of
a
corollary
of
this
is
the
impossibility
of
in
so
far
as
they
pretend
to
effect
the
transference
of
one
expression
into
another
like
a
liquid
poured
from
a
vase
of
a
certain
shape
into
a
vase
of
another
shape
we
can
elaborate
logically
what
we
have
already
elaborated
in
aesthetic
form
only
but
we
can
not
reduce
that
which
has
already
possessed
its
aesthetic
form
to
another
form
also
aesthetic
in
truth
every
translation
either
diminishes
and
spoils
or
it
creates
a
new
expression
by
putting
the
former
back
into
the
crucible
and
mixing
it
with
other
impressions
belonging
to
the
pretended
translator
in
the
former
case
the
expression
always
remains
one
that
of
the
original
the
translation
being
more
or
less
deficient
that
is
to
say
not
properly
expression
in
the
other
case
there
would
certainly
be
two
expressions
but
with
two
different
contents
ugly
faithful
ones
or
faithless
beauties
is
a
proverb
that
well
expresses
the
dilemma
with
which
every
translator
is
faced
in
aesthetic
translations
such
as
those
which
are
word
for
word
or
interlinear
or
paraphrastic
translations
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
simple
commentaries
on
the
original
sidenote
of
rhetorical
the
division
of
expressions
into
various
classes
is
known
in
literature
by
the
name
of
theory
of
or
of
but
similar
attempts
at
classification
in
the
other
forms
of
art
are
not
wanting
suffice
it
to
mention
the
and
symbolic
spoken
of
in
painting
and
sculpture
the
scientific
value
to
be
attached
in
aesthetic
and
in
aesthetic
criticism
to
these
distinctions
of
and
of
and
absence
of
of
and
of
and
of
and
of
and
of
the
fourteen
forms
of
metaphor
of
the
figures
of
and
of
and
further
of
of
of
of
of
and
and
so
on
is
or
altogether
negative
to
none
of
these
terms
and
distinctions
can
be
given
a
satisfactory
aesthetic
definition
those
that
have
been
attempted
when
they
are
not
obviously
erroneous
are
words
devoid
of
sense
a
typical
example
of
this
is
the
very
common
definition
of
metaphor
as
of
word
used
in
place
of
the
word
now
why
give
oneself
this
trouble
why
take
the
worse
and
longer
road
when
you
know
the
shorter
and
better
road
perhaps
as
is
generally
said
because
the
correct
word
is
in
certain
cases
not
so
as
the
incorrect
word
or
metaphor
but
in
that
case
the
metaphor
becomes
exactly
the
right
word
and
the
right
word
if
it
were
used
would
be
little
and
therefore
most
improper
similar
observations
of
elementary
good
sense
can
be
made
regarding
the
other
categories
as
for
example
the
generic
one
of
the
ornate
one
can
ask
oneself
how
an
ornament
can
be
joined
to
expression
externally
in
that
case
it
must
always
remain
separate
internally
in
that
case
either
it
does
not
assist
expression
and
mars
it
or
it
does
form
part
of
it
and
is
not
ornament
but
a
constituent
element
of
expression
indistinguishable
from
the
whole
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
harm
done
by
these
distinctions
rhetoric
has
often
been
declaimed
against
but
although
there
has
been
rebellion
against
its
consequences
its
principles
have
been
carefully
preserved
perhaps
in
order
to
show
proof
of
philosophic
coherence
rhetoric
has
contributed
if
not
to
make
dominant
in
literary
production
at
least
to
justify
theoretically
that
particular
mode
of
writing
ill
which
is
called
fine
writing
or
writing
according
to
rhetoric
sidenote
sense
of
the
rhetorical
the
terms
above
mentioned
would
never
have
gone
beyond
the
schools
where
we
all
of
us
learned
them
certain
of
never
finding
the
opportunity
of
using
them
in
strictly
aesthetic
discussions
or
even
of
doing
so
jocosely
and
with
a
comic
intention
save
when
occasionally
employed
in
one
of
the
following
significations
as
variants
the
aesthetic
concept
as
indications
of
the
or
finally
and
this
is
their
most
important
use
in
a
sense
which
is
no
longer
aesthetic
and
literary
merely
sidenote
of
these
categories
as
synonyms
of
the
aesthetic
expressions
are
not
divisible
into
classes
but
some
are
successful
others
others
failures
there
are
perfect
and
imperfect
complete
and
deficient
expressions
the
terms
already
cited
then
sometimes
indicate
the
successful
expression
sometimes
the
various
forms
of
the
failures
but
they
are
employed
in
the
most
inconstant
and
capricious
manner
for
it
often
happens
that
the
same
word
serves
now
to
proclaim
the
perfect
now
to
condemn
the
imperfect
an
instance
of
this
is
found
when
someone
criticizing
two
pictures
the
one
without
inspiration
in
which
the
author
has
copied
natural
objects
without
intelligence
the
other
inspired
but
without
obvious
likeness
to
existing
objects
calls
the
first
the
second
others
on
the
contrary
pronounce
the
word
about
a
strongly
felt
picture
representing
a
scene
of
ordinary
life
while
they
talk
of
in
reference
to
another
picture
representing
but
a
cold
allegory
it
is
evident
that
in
the
first
case
symbolic
means
artistic
and
realistic
inartistic
while
in
the
second
realistic
is
synonymous
with
artistic
and
symbolic
with
inartistic
how
then
can
we
be
astonished
when
some
hotly
maintain
that
the
true
art
form
is
the
symbolic
and
that
the
realistic
is
inartistic
others
that
the
realistic
is
the
artistic
and
the
symbolic
the
inartistic
we
can
not
but
grant
that
both
are
right
since
each
makes
use
of
the
same
words
in
senses
so
diverse
the
great
disputes
about
the
and
the
are
frequently
based
upon
such
equivokes
sometimes
the
former
was
understood
as
the
artistically
perfect
and
the
second
as
lacking
balance
and
imperfect
at
others
the
classic
was
cold
and
artificial
the
romantic
sincere
warm
efficacious
and
truly
expressive
thus
it
was
always
possible
to
take
the
side
of
the
classic
against
the
romantic
or
of
the
romantic
against
the
classic
the
same
thing
happens
as
regards
the
word
sometimes
it
is
affirmed
that
every
writer
should
have
style
here
style
is
synonymous
with
form
or
expression
sometimes
the
form
of
a
code
of
laws
or
of
a
mathematical
work
is
said
to
be
devoid
of
style
here
the
error
of
admitting
diverse
modes
of
expression
is
again
committed
of
admitting
an
ornate
and
a
naked
form
of
expression
because
since
style
is
form
the
code
and
the
mathematical
treatise
must
also
strictly
speaking
have
each
its
style
at
other
times
one
hears
the
critics
blaming
someone
for
having
too
much
style
or
for
writing
a
style
here
it
is
clear
that
style
signifies
not
the
form
nor
a
mode
of
it
but
improper
and
pretentious
expression
which
is
one
form
of
the
inartistic
sidenote
use
to
indicate
various
aesthetic
passing
to
the
second
not
altogether
insignificant
use
of
these
words
and
distinctions
we
sometimes
find
in
the
examination
of
a
literary
composition
such
remarks
as
follow
here
is
a
pleonasm
here
an
ellipse
there
a
metaphor
here
again
a
synonym
or
an
equivoke
this
means
that
in
one
place
is
an
error
consisting
of
using
a
larger
number
of
words
than
is
necessary
pleonasm
that
in
another
the
error
arises
from
too
few
having
been
used
ellipse
elsewhere
from
the
use
of
an
unsuitable
word
metaphor
or
from
the
use
of
two
words
which
seem
to
express
two
different
things
where
they
really
express
the
same
thing
synonym
or
that
on
the
contrary
it
arises
from
having
employed
one
which
seems
to
express
the
same
thing
where
it
expresses
two
different
things
equivoke
this
pejorative
and
pathological
use
of
the
terms
is
however
more
uncommon
than
the
preceding
sidenote
use
in
a
sense
transcending
aesthetic
in
the
service
of
finally
when
rhetorical
terminology
possesses
no
aesthetic
signification
similar
or
analogous
to
those
passed
in
review
and
yet
one
is
aware
that
it
is
not
void
of
meaning
and
designates
something
that
deserves
to
be
noted
it
is
then
used
in
the
service
of
logic
and
of
science
if
it
be
granted
that
a
concept
used
in
a
scientific
sense
by
a
given
writer
is
expressed
with
a
definite
term
it
is
natural
that
other
words
formed
by
that
writer
as
used
to
signify
the
same
concept
or
incidentally
made
use
of
by
him
become
respect
the
vocabulary
fixed
upon
by
him
as
true
metaphors
synecdoches
synonyms
elliptic
forms
and
the
like
we
too
in
the
course
of
this
treatise
have
several
times
made
use
of
and
intend
again
to
make
use
of
such
terms
in
order
to
make
clear
the
sense
of
the
words
we
employ
or
may
find
employed
but
this
proceeding
which
is
of
value
in
the
disquisitions
of
scientific
and
intellectual
criticism
has
none
whatever
in
aesthetic
criticism
for
science
there
exist
appropriate
words
and
metaphors
the
same
concept
may
be
psychologically
formed
in
various
circumstances
and
therefore
be
expressed
with
various
intuitions
when
the
scientific
terminology
of
a
given
writer
has
been
established
and
one
of
these
modes
has
been
fixed
as
correct
then
all
other
uses
of
it
become
improper
or
tropical
but
in
the
aesthetic
fact
exist
only
appropriate
words
the
same
intuition
can
only
be
expressed
in
one
way
precisely
because
it
is
an
intuition
and
not
a
concept
sidenote
in
the
some
while
they
admit
the
aesthetic
insufficiency
of
the
rhetorical
categories
yet
make
a
reserve
as
regards
their
utility
and
the
service
they
are
supposed
to
render
especially
in
schools
of
literature
we
confess
that
we
fail
to
understand
how
error
and
confusion
can
educate
the
mind
to
logical
clearness
or
aid
the
teaching
of
a
science
which
they
disturb
and
obscure
perhaps
it
may
be
desired
to
say
that
they
can
aid
memory
and
learning
as
empirical
classes
as
was
admitted
above
for
literary
and
artistic
styles
but
there
is
another
purpose
for
which
the
rhetorical
categories
should
certainly
continue
to
be
admitted
to
the
schools
to
be
criticized
there
we
can
not
simply
forget
the
errors
of
the
past
and
truth
can
not
be
kept
alive
save
by
making
it
fight
against
error
unless
a
notion
of
the
rhetorical
categories
be
given
accompanied
by
a
suitable
criticism
of
these
there
is
a
risk
of
their
springing
up
again
for
they
are
already
springing
up
with
certain
philologists
disguised
as
most
recent
discoveries
sidenote
resemblances
of
it
would
seem
as
though
we
wished
to
deny
all
bond
of
likeness
among
themselves
between
expressions
and
works
of
art
the
likenesses
exist
and
owing
to
them
works
of
art
can
be
arranged
in
this
or
that
group
but
they
are
likenesses
such
as
are
observed
among
individuals
and
can
never
be
rendered
with
abstract
definitions
that
is
to
say
these
likenesses
have
nothing
to
do
with
identification
subordination
and
the
other
relations
of
concepts
they
consist
wholly
in
what
is
called
a
and
are
connected
with
those
historical
conditions
existing
at
the
birth
of
the
various
works
or
in
an
affinity
of
soul
between
the
artists
sidenote
relative
possibility
of
it
is
in
these
resemblances
that
lies
the
possibility
of
translations
this
does
not
consist
of
the
reproduction
of
the
same
original
expressions
which
it
would
be
vain
to
attempt
but
in
the
measure
that
expressions
are
given
more
or
less
nearly
resembling
those
the
translation
that
passes
for
good
is
an
approximation
which
has
original
value
as
a
work
of
art
and
can
stand
by
itself
x
aesthetic
feelings
and
the
distinction
between
the
ugly
and
the
beautiful
passing
on
to
the
study
of
more
complex
concepts
where
the
aesthetic
activity
is
found
in
conjunction
with
other
orders
of
facts
and
showing
the
mode
of
this
union
or
complication
we
find
ourselves
at
once
face
to
face
with
the
concept
of
and
with
the
feelings
which
are
called
sidenote
significances
of
the
word
the
word
feeling
is
one
of
the
richest
in
meanings
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
meet
with
it
once
among
those
used
to
designate
the
spirit
in
its
passivity
the
matter
or
content
of
art
and
also
as
synonym
of
once
again
and
then
the
meaning
was
altogether
different
we
have
met
with
it
as
designating
the
and
character
of
the
aesthetic
fact
that
is
to
say
pure
intuition
a
form
of
truth
which
defines
no
concept
and
states
no
fact
sidenote
as
but
feeling
is
not
here
understood
in
either
of
these
two
senses
nor
in
the
others
in
which
it
has
nevertheless
been
used
to
designate
other
forms
of
spirit
its
meaning
here
is
that
of
a
special
activity
of
nature
but
possessing
its
two
poles
positive
and
negative
in
and
this
activity
has
always
greatly
embarrassed
philosophers
who
have
attempted
either
to
deny
it
as
an
activity
or
to
attribute
it
to
and
to
exclude
it
from
spirit
both
solutions
bristle
with
difficulties
and
these
are
of
such
a
kind
that
the
solutions
prove
themselves
finally
unacceptable
to
anyone
who
examines
them
with
care
for
of
what
could
a
activity
consist
an
of
when
we
have
no
other
knowledge
of
activity
save
as
spiritual
and
of
spirituality
save
as
activity
nature
is
in
this
case
by
definition
the
merely
passive
inert
mechanical
and
material
on
the
other
hand
the
negation
of
the
character
of
activity
to
feeling
is
energetically
disproved
by
those
very
poles
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
which
appear
in
it
and
manifest
activity
in
its
concreteness
and
we
will
say
all
aquiver
sidenote
of
feeling
with
economic
this
critical
conclusion
ought
to
place
us
in
the
greatest
embarrassment
for
in
the
sketch
of
the
system
of
the
spirit
given
above
we
have
left
no
room
for
the
new
activity
of
which
we
are
now
obliged
to
recognize
the
existence
but
activity
of
feeling
if
it
be
activity
is
not
specially
new
it
has
already
had
its
place
assigned
to
it
in
the
system
which
we
have
sketched
where
however
it
has
been
indicated
under
another
name
as
activity
what
is
called
the
activity
of
feeling
is
nothing
but
that
more
elementary
and
fundamental
practical
activity
which
we
have
distinguished
from
ethical
activity
and
made
to
consist
of
the
appetite
and
desire
for
some
individual
end
without
any
moral
determination
sidenote
of
if
feeling
has
been
sometimes
considered
as
organic
or
natural
activity
this
has
happened
precisely
because
it
does
not
coincide
either
with
logical
aesthetic
or
ethical
activity
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
these
three
which
were
the
only
ones
admitted
it
has
seemed
to
lie
the
true
and
real
spirit
the
spirit
in
its
aristocracy
and
to
be
almost
a
determination
of
nature
and
of
the
soul
in
so
far
as
it
is
nature
thus
the
thesis
several
times
maintained
that
the
aesthetic
activity
like
the
ethical
and
intellectual
activities
is
not
feeling
becomes
at
once
completely
proved
this
thesis
was
inexpugnable
when
sensation
had
already
been
reduced
confusedly
and
implicitly
to
economic
volition
the
view
which
has
been
refuted
is
known
by
the
name
of
for
hedonism
all
the
various
forms
of
the
spirit
are
reduced
to
one
which
thus
itself
also
loses
its
own
distinctive
character
and
becomes
something
turbid
and
mysterious
like
the
shades
in
which
all
cows
are
black
having
effected
this
reduction
and
mutilation
the
hedonists
naturally
do
not
succeed
in
seeing
anything
else
in
any
activity
but
pleasure
and
pain
they
find
no
substantial
difference
between
the
pleasure
of
art
and
that
of
an
easy
digestion
between
the
pleasure
of
a
good
action
and
that
of
breathing
the
fresh
air
with
lungs
sidenote
as
a
concomitant
to
every
form
of
but
if
the
activity
of
feeling
in
the
sense
here
defined
must
not
be
substituted
for
all
the
other
forms
of
spiritual
activity
we
have
not
said
that
it
can
not
them
indeed
it
accompanies
them
of
necessity
because
they
are
all
in
close
relation
both
with
one
another
and
with
the
elementary
volitional
form
therefore
each
of
them
has
for
concomitants
individual
volitions
and
volitional
pleasures
and
pains
which
are
known
as
feeling
but
we
must
not
confound
what
is
concomitant
with
the
principal
fact
and
take
the
one
for
the
other
the
discovery
of
the
truth
or
the
satisfaction
of
a
moral
duty
fulfilled
produces
in
us
a
joy
which
makes
our
whole
being
vibrate
for
by
attaining
to
those
forms
of
spiritual
activity
it
attains
at
the
same
time
that
to
which
it
was
tending
as
to
its
end
during
the
effort
nevertheless
economic
or
hedonistic
satisfaction
ethical
satisfaction
aesthetic
satisfaction
intellectual
satisfaction
remain
always
distinct
even
when
in
union
thus
is
solved
at
the
same
time
the
question
which
has
seemed
not
wrongly
a
matter
of
life
or
death
for
aesthetic
science
namely
whether
the
feeling
and
the
pleasure
precede
or
follow
are
cause
or
effect
of
the
aesthetic
fact
we
must
enlarge
this
question
to
include
the
relation
between
the
various
spiritual
forms
and
solve
it
in
the
sense
that
in
the
unity
of
the
spirit
one
can
not
talk
of
cause
and
effect
and
of
what
comes
first
and
what
follows
it
in
time
and
once
the
relation
above
exposed
is
established
the
statements
which
it
is
customary
to
make
as
to
the
nature
of
aesthetic
moral
intellectual
and
even
as
is
sometimes
said
economic
feelings
must
also
fall
in
this
last
case
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
question
not
of
two
terms
but
of
one
and
the
quest
of
economic
feeling
can
be
but
that
same
one
concerning
the
economic
activity
but
in
the
other
cases
also
the
search
can
never
be
directed
to
the
substantive
but
to
the
adjective
aesthetic
morality
logic
explain
the
colouring
of
the
feelings
as
aesthetic
moral
and
intellectual
while
feeling
studied
alone
will
never
explain
those
refractions
sidenote
of
certain
ordinary
distinctions
of
a
further
consequence
is
that
we
can
free
ourselves
from
the
distinction
between
values
or
feelings
and
feelings
that
are
merely
hedonistic
and
also
from
other
similar
distinctions
like
those
between
feelings
and
feelings
between
and
the
others
that
are
not
but
simply
between
feelings
of
and
others
of
and
of
the
germans
those
distinctions
strove
hard
to
save
the
three
spiritual
forms
which
have
been
recognised
as
the
triad
of
the
the
and
the
from
confusion
with
the
fourth
form
still
unknown
yet
insidious
through
its
indeterminateness
and
mother
of
scandals
for
us
this
triad
has
finished
its
task
because
we
are
capable
of
reaching
the
distinction
far
more
directly
by
welcoming
even
the
selfish
subjective
merely
pleasurable
feelings
among
the
respectable
forms
of
the
spirit
and
where
formerly
antitheses
were
conceived
of
by
ourselves
and
others
between
value
and
feelings
as
between
spirituality
and
naturality
henceforth
we
see
nothing
but
difference
between
value
and
value
sidenote
and
disvalue
the
contraries
and
their
as
has
already
been
said
the
economic
feeling
or
activity
reveals
itself
as
divided
into
two
poles
positive
and
negative
pleasure
and
pain
which
we
can
now
translate
into
useful
and
useless
or
hurtful
this
bipartition
has
already
been
noted
above
as
a
mark
of
the
active
character
of
feeling
precisely
because
the
same
bipartition
is
found
in
all
forms
of
activity
if
each
of
these
is
a
each
has
opposed
to
it
or
absence
of
value
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
disvalue
but
activity
and
passivity
must
be
struggling
between
themselves
without
the
one
getting
the
better
of
the
other
hence
the
contradiction
and
the
disvalue
of
the
activity
that
is
embarrassed
contested
or
interrupted
value
is
activity
that
unfolds
itself
freely
disvalue
is
its
contrary
we
will
content
ourselves
with
this
definition
of
the
two
terms
without
entering
into
the
problem
of
the
relation
between
value
and
disvalue
that
is
between
the
problem
of
contraries
are
these
to
be
thought
of
dualistically
as
two
beings
or
two
orders
of
beings
like
ormuzd
and
ahriman
angels
and
devils
enemies
to
one
another
or
as
a
unity
which
is
also
contrariety
this
definition
of
the
two
terms
will
be
sufficient
for
our
purpose
which
is
to
make
clear
aesthetic
activity
in
particular
and
one
of
the
most
obscure
and
disputed
concepts
of
aesthetic
which
arises
at
this
point
the
concept
of
the
sidenote
beautiful
as
the
value
of
expression
or
expression
and
nothing
aesthetic
intellectual
economic
and
ethical
values
and
disvalues
are
variously
denominated
in
current
speech
true
good
useful
and
so
on
these
words
designate
the
free
development
of
spiritual
activity
action
scientific
research
artistic
production
when
they
are
successful
false
bad
useless
unbecoming
unjust
designate
embarrassed
activity
the
product
of
which
is
a
failure
in
linguistic
usage
these
denominations
are
being
continually
shifted
from
one
order
of
facts
to
another
and
from
this
to
that
for
instance
is
said
not
only
of
a
successful
expression
but
also
of
a
scientific
truth
of
an
action
successfully
achieved
and
of
a
moral
action
thus
we
talk
of
an
of
a
of
a
many
philosophers
especially
aestheticians
have
lost
their
heads
in
their
pursuit
of
these
most
varied
uses
they
have
entered
an
inextricable
and
impervious
verbal
labyrinth
for
this
reason
it
has
hitherto
seemed
convenient
studiously
to
avoid
the
use
of
the
word
beautiful
to
indicate
successful
expression
but
after
all
the
explanations
that
have
been
given
and
all
danger
of
misunderstanding
being
now
dissipated
and
since
on
the
other
hand
we
can
not
fail
to
recognize
that
the
prevailing
tendency
alike
in
current
speech
and
in
philosophy
is
to
limit
the
meaning
of
the
vocable
altogether
to
the
aesthetic
value
we
may
define
beauty
as
or
better
as
and
nothing
more
because
expression
when
it
is
not
successful
is
not
expression
sidenote
ugly
and
the
elements
of
beauty
which
compose
consequently
the
ugly
is
unsuccessful
expression
the
paradox
is
true
that
in
works
of
art
that
are
failures
the
beautiful
is
present
as
and
the
ugly
as
thus
with
regard
to
works
of
art
that
are
more
or
less
failures
we
talk
of
qualities
that
is
to
say
of
parts
of
them
that
are
we
do
not
talk
thus
of
perfect
works
it
is
in
fact
impossible
to
enumerate
their
qualities
or
to
designate
those
parts
of
them
that
are
beautiful
in
them
there
is
complete
fusion
they
have
but
one
quality
life
circulates
in
the
whole
organism
it
is
not
withdrawn
into
certain
parts
the
qualities
of
works
that
are
failures
may
be
of
various
degrees
they
may
even
be
very
great
the
beautiful
does
not
possess
degrees
for
there
is
no
conceiving
a
more
beautiful
that
is
an
expressive
that
is
more
expressive
an
adequate
that
is
more
than
adequate
ugliness
on
the
other
hand
does
possess
degrees
from
the
rather
ugly
or
almost
beautiful
to
the
extremely
ugly
but
if
the
ugly
were
that
is
to
say
without
any
element
of
beauty
it
would
for
that
very
reason
cease
to
be
ugly
because
in
it
would
be
absent
the
contradiction
which
is
the
reason
of
its
existence
the
disvalue
would
become
nonvalue
activity
would
give
place
to
passivity
with
which
it
is
not
at
war
save
when
there
effectively
is
war
sidenote
that
there
exist
expressions
which
are
neither
beautiful
nor
and
because
the
distinctive
consciousness
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
is
based
on
the
contrasts
and
contradictions
in
which
aesthetic
activity
is
developed
it
is
evident
that
this
consciousness
becomes
attenuated
to
the
point
of
disappearing
altogether
as
we
descend
from
the
more
complicated
to
the
more
simple
and
to
the
simplest
cases
of
expression
from
this
arises
the
illusion
that
there
are
expressions
which
are
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
those
which
are
obtained
without
sensible
effort
and
appear
easy
and
natural
being
so
considered
sidenote
aesthetic
feelings
and
concomitant
or
accidental
the
whole
mystery
of
the
and
the
is
reduced
to
these
henceforth
most
easy
definitions
should
any
one
object
that
there
exist
perfect
aesthetic
expressions
before
which
no
pleasure
is
felt
and
others
perhaps
even
failures
which
give
him
the
greatest
pleasure
it
is
necessary
to
advise
him
to
pay
great
attention
as
regards
the
aesthetic
fact
to
that
only
which
is
truly
aesthetic
pleasure
aesthetic
pleasure
is
sometimes
reinforced
by
pleasures
arising
from
extraneous
facts
which
are
only
casually
found
united
with
it
the
poet
or
any
other
artist
affords
an
instance
of
purely
aesthetic
pleasure
during
the
moment
in
which
he
sees
or
has
the
intuition
of
his
work
for
the
first
time
that
is
to
say
when
his
impressions
take
form
and
his
countenance
is
irradiated
with
the
divine
joy
of
the
creator
on
the
other
hand
a
mixed
pleasure
is
experienced
by
any
one
who
goes
to
the
theatre
after
a
day
work
to
witness
a
comedy
when
the
pleasure
of
rest
and
amusement
and
that
of
laughingly
snatching
a
nail
from
the
gaping
coffin
is
accompanied
at
a
certain
moment
by
real
aesthetic
pleasure
obtained
from
the
art
of
the
dramatist
and
of
the
actors
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
artist
who
looks
upon
his
labour
with
pleasure
when
it
is
finished
experiencing
in
addition
to
the
aesthetic
pleasure
that
very
different
one
which
arises
from
the
thought
of
satisfied
or
of
the
economic
gain
which
will
come
to
him
from
his
work
examples
could
be
multiplied
sidenote
of
apparent
a
category
of
aesthetic
feelings
has
been
formed
in
modern
aesthetic
these
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
aesthetic
sensations
of
pleasure
arising
from
the
form
that
is
to
say
from
the
work
of
art
on
the
contrary
they
arise
from
the
content
of
the
work
of
art
it
has
been
observed
that
artistic
representations
arouse
pleasure
and
pain
in
their
infinite
variety
and
gradations
we
tremble
with
anxiety
we
rejoice
we
fear
we
laugh
we
weep
we
desire
with
the
personages
of
a
drama
or
of
a
romance
with
the
figures
in
a
picture
or
with
the
melody
of
music
but
these
feelings
are
not
those
that
would
give
occasion
to
the
real
fact
outside
art
that
is
to
say
they
are
the
same
in
quality
but
they
are
quantitively
an
attenuation
aesthetic
and
pleasure
and
pain
are
slight
of
little
depth
and
changeable
we
have
no
need
to
treat
of
these
for
the
good
reason
that
we
have
already
amply
discussed
them
indeed
we
have
treated
of
them
alone
what
are
ever
feelings
that
become
apparent
or
manifest
but
feelings
objectified
intensified
expressed
and
it
is
natural
that
they
do
not
trouble
and
agitate
us
passionately
as
do
those
of
real
life
because
those
were
matter
these
are
form
and
activity
those
true
and
proper
feelings
these
intuitions
and
expressions
the
formula
then
of
is
nothing
but
a
tautology
the
best
that
can
be
done
is
to
run
the
pen
through
it
xi
critique
of
aesthetic
hedonism
as
we
are
opposed
to
hedonism
in
general
that
is
to
say
to
the
theory
which
is
based
on
the
pleasure
and
pain
intrinsic
to
economy
and
accompanies
every
other
form
of
activity
confounding
the
content
and
that
which
contains
it
and
fails
to
recognize
any
process
but
the
hedonistic
so
we
are
opposed
to
aesthetic
hedonism
in
particular
which
looks
upon
the
aesthetic
at
any
rate
if
not
also
upon
all
other
activities
as
a
simple
fact
of
feeling
and
confounds
the
of
which
is
the
beautiful
with
the
pleasurable
and
nothing
more
and
with
the
pleasurable
of
all
sorts
sidenote
of
the
beautiful
as
that
which
pleases
the
higher
the
point
of
view
has
been
presented
in
several
forms
one
of
the
most
ancient
conceives
the
beautiful
as
that
which
pleases
the
sight
and
hearing
that
is
to
say
the
superior
senses
when
analysis
of
aesthetic
facts
first
began
it
was
in
fact
difficult
to
avoid
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
a
picture
and
a
piece
of
music
are
impressions
of
sight
or
of
hearing
it
was
and
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
the
blind
man
does
not
enjoy
the
picture
nor
the
deaf
man
the
music
to
show
as
we
have
shown
that
the
aesthetic
fact
does
not
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
impressions
but
that
all
sensible
impressions
can
be
raised
to
aesthetic
expression
and
that
none
need
of
necessity
be
so
raised
is
an
idea
which
presents
itself
only
when
all
the
other
ways
out
of
the
difficulty
have
been
tried
but
whoso
imagines
that
the
aesthetic
fact
is
something
pleasing
to
the
eyes
or
to
the
hearing
has
no
line
of
defence
against
him
who
proceeds
logically
to
identify
the
beautiful
with
the
pleasurable
in
general
and
includes
cooking
in
aesthetic
or
as
some
positivist
has
done
the
viscerally
beautiful
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
theory
of
is
another
form
of
aesthetic
hedonism
the
conception
of
play
has
sometimes
helped
towards
the
realization
of
the
actifying
character
of
the
expressive
fact
man
it
has
been
said
is
not
really
man
save
when
he
begins
to
play
that
is
to
say
when
he
frees
himself
from
natural
and
mechanical
causality
and
operates
spiritually
and
his
first
game
is
art
but
since
the
word
also
means
that
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
expenditure
of
the
exuberant
energy
of
the
organism
that
is
to
say
from
a
practical
act
the
consequence
of
this
theory
has
been
that
every
game
has
been
called
an
aesthetic
fact
and
that
the
aesthetic
function
has
been
called
a
game
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
play
with
it
for
like
science
and
every
other
thing
aesthetic
can
be
made
part
of
a
game
but
morality
can
not
be
provoked
at
the
intention
of
playing
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
consent
on
the
contrary
it
dominates
and
regulates
the
act
of
playing
itself
sidenote
of
the
theories
of
sexuality
and
of
the
finally
there
have
been
some
who
have
tried
to
deduce
the
pleasure
of
art
from
the
reaction
of
the
sexual
organs
there
are
some
very
modern
aestheticians
who
place
the
genesis
of
the
aesthetic
fact
in
the
pleasure
of
of
or
as
others
add
in
the
desire
of
the
male
who
wishes
to
conquer
the
female
this
theory
is
seasoned
with
much
anecdotal
erudition
heaven
knows
of
what
degree
of
credibility
on
the
customs
of
savage
peoples
but
in
very
truth
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
important
aid
for
one
often
meets
in
ordinary
life
poets
who
adorn
themselves
with
their
poetry
like
cocks
that
raise
their
crests
or
turkeys
that
spread
their
tails
but
he
who
does
such
things
in
so
far
as
he
does
them
is
not
a
poet
but
a
poor
devil
of
a
cock
or
turkey
the
conquest
of
woman
does
not
suffice
to
explain
the
art
fact
it
would
be
just
as
correct
to
term
poetry
because
there
have
been
aulic
and
stipendiary
poets
and
there
are
poets
the
sale
of
whose
verses
helps
them
to
gain
their
livelihood
if
it
does
not
altogether
provide
it
however
this
definition
has
not
failed
to
win
over
some
zealous
neophytes
of
historical
materialism
sidenote
of
the
aesthetic
of
the
sympathetic
meaning
in
it
of
content
and
another
less
vulgar
current
of
thought
considers
aesthetic
to
be
the
science
of
the
of
that
with
which
we
sympathize
which
attracts
rejoices
gives
us
pleasure
and
excites
admiration
but
the
sympathetic
is
nothing
but
the
image
or
representation
of
what
pleases
and
as
such
it
is
a
complex
fact
resulting
from
a
constant
element
the
aesthetic
element
of
representation
and
from
a
variable
element
the
pleasing
in
its
infinite
forms
arising
from
all
the
various
classes
of
values
in
ordinary
language
there
is
sometimes
a
feeling
of
repugnance
at
calling
an
expression
beautiful
which
is
not
an
expression
of
the
sympathetic
hence
the
continual
contrast
between
the
point
of
view
of
the
aesthetician
or
of
the
art
critic
and
that
of
the
ordinary
person
who
can
not
succeed
in
persuading
himself
that
the
image
of
pain
and
of
turpitude
can
be
beautiful
or
at
least
can
be
beautiful
with
as
much
right
as
the
pleasing
and
the
good
the
opposition
could
be
solved
by
distinguishing
two
different
sciences
one
of
expression
and
the
other
of
the
sympathetic
if
the
latter
could
be
the
object
of
a
special
science
that
is
to
say
if
it
were
not
as
has
been
shown
a
complex
fact
if
predominance
be
given
to
the
expressive
fact
it
becomes
a
part
of
aesthetic
as
science
of
expression
if
to
the
pleasurable
content
we
fall
back
to
the
study
of
facts
which
are
essentially
hedonistic
utilitarian
however
complicated
they
may
appear
the
origin
also
of
the
connexion
between
content
and
form
is
to
be
sought
for
in
the
aesthetic
of
the
sympathetic
when
this
is
conceived
as
the
sum
of
two
values
sidenote
hedonism
and
in
all
the
doctrines
just
now
discussed
the
art
fact
is
posited
as
merely
hedonistic
but
this
view
can
not
be
maintained
save
by
uniting
it
with
a
philosophic
hedonism
that
is
complete
and
not
partial
that
is
to
say
with
a
hedonism
which
does
not
admit
any
other
form
of
value
hardly
has
this
hedonistic
conception
of
art
been
received
by
philosophers
who
admit
one
or
more
spiritual
values
of
truth
or
of
morality
than
the
following
question
must
necessarily
be
asked
what
should
be
done
with
art
to
what
use
should
it
be
put
should
a
free
course
be
allowed
to
its
pleasures
and
if
so
to
what
extent
the
question
of
the
of
which
in
the
aesthetic
of
expression
would
be
a
contradiction
of
terms
here
appears
in
place
and
altogether
logical
sidenote
rigoristic
negation
and
the
pedagogic
justification
of
now
it
is
evident
that
admitting
the
premisses
but
two
solutions
of
such
a
question
can
be
given
the
one
altogether
negative
the
other
restrictive
the
first
which
we
shall
call
or
appears
several
times
although
not
frequently
in
the
history
of
ideas
it
looks
upon
art
as
an
inebriation
of
the
senses
and
therefore
not
only
useless
but
harmful
according
to
this
theory
then
it
is
necessary
to
drive
it
with
all
our
strength
from
the
human
soul
which
it
troubles
the
other
solution
which
we
shall
call
or
admits
art
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
concurs
with
the
end
of
morality
in
so
far
as
it
assists
with
innocent
pleasure
the
work
of
him
who
leads
to
the
true
and
the
good
in
so
far
as
it
sprinkles
with
dulcet
balm
the
sides
of
the
vase
of
wisdom
and
of
morality
it
is
well
to
observe
that
it
would
be
an
error
to
divide
this
second
view
into
intellectualist
and
according
to
whether
the
end
of
leading
to
the
true
or
to
what
is
practically
good
be
assigned
to
art
the
task
of
instructing
which
is
imposed
upon
it
precisely
because
it
is
an
end
which
is
sought
after
and
advised
is
no
longer
merely
a
theoretical
fact
but
a
theoretical
fact
become
the
material
for
practical
action
it
is
not
therefore
intellectualism
but
pedagogism
and
practicism
nor
would
it
be
more
exact
to
subdivide
the
pedagogic
view
into
the
pure
utilitarian
and
the
because
those
who
admit
only
the
individually
useful
the
desire
of
the
individual
precisely
because
they
are
absolute
hedonists
have
no
motive
for
seeking
an
ulterior
justification
for
art
but
to
enunciate
these
theories
at
the
point
to
which
we
have
attained
is
to
confute
them
we
therefore
restrict
ourselves
to
observing
that
in
the
pedagogic
theory
of
art
is
to
be
found
another
of
the
reasons
why
it
has
been
erroneously
claimed
that
the
content
of
art
should
be
with
a
view
to
certain
practical
effects
sidenote
of
pure
the
thesis
by
the
artists
that
art
consists
of
has
often
been
brought
forward
against
hedonistic
and
pedagogic
aesthetic
heaven
places
all
our
joy
in
and
the
verse
is
everything
if
it
is
wished
that
this
should
be
understood
in
the
sense
that
art
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
sensual
pleasure
that
is
in
fact
with
utilitarian
practicism
nor
with
moralism
then
our
aesthetic
also
must
be
permitted
to
adorn
itself
with
the
title
of
of
pure
but
if
as
is
often
the
case
something
mystical
and
transcendental
be
meant
by
this
something
that
is
unknown
to
our
poor
human
world
or
something
spiritual
and
beatific
but
not
expressive
we
must
reply
that
while
applauding
the
conception
of
a
beauty
free
of
all
that
is
not
the
spiritual
form
of
expression
we
are
yet
unable
to
conceive
a
beauty
altogether
purified
of
expression
that
is
to
say
separated
from
itself
xii
the
aesthetic
of
the
sympathetic
and
concepts
sidenote

and
the

of
the
the
doctrine
of
the
sympathetic
very
often
animated
and
seconded
in
this
by
the
capricious
metaphysical
and
mystical
aesthetic
and
by
that
blind
tradition
which
assumes
an
intimate
connection
between
things
by
chance
treated
of
together
by
the
same
authors
and
in
the
same
books
has
introduced
and
rendered
familiar
in
systems
of
aesthetic
a
series
of
concepts
of
which
one
example
suffices
to
justify
our
resolute
expulsion
of
them
from
our
own
treatise
their
catalogue

long
not
to

horrible

dreadful
the
list
can
be
increased
at
will
since
that
doctrine
took
as
its
special
object
the
sympathetic
it
was
naturally
unable
to
neglect
any
of
the
varieties
of
this
or
any
of
the
combinations
or
gradations
which
lead
at
last
from
the
sympathetic
to
the
antipathetic
and
seeing
that
the
sympathetic
content
was
held
to
be
the
and
the
antipathetic
the
the
varieties
tragic
comic
sublime
pathetic
etc
constituted
for
it
the
shades
and
gradations
intervening
between
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
ugly
in
art
and
of
the
ugly
having
enumerated
and
defined
as
well
as
it
could
the
chief
among
these
varieties
the
aesthetic
of
the
sympathetic
set
itself
the
problem
of
the
place
to
be
assigned
to
the
in
this
problem
is
without
meaning
for
us
who
do
not
recognize
any
ugliness
save
the
or
inexpressive
which
can
never
form
part
of
the
aesthetic
fact
being
on
the
contrary
its
antithesis
but
the
question
for
the
doctrine
which
we
are
here
criticizing
was
to
reconcile
in
some
way
the
false
and
defective
idea
of
art
from
which
it
started
reduced
to
the
representation
of
the
agreeable
with
effective
art
which
occupies
a
far
wider
field
hence
the
artificial
attempt
to
settle
what
examples
of
the
ugly
antipathetic
could
be
admitted
in
artistic
representation
and
for
what
reasons
and
in
what
ways
the
answer
was
that
the
ugly
is
admissible
only
when
it
can
be
an
unconquerable
ugliness
such
as
the
or
the
being
altogether
excluded
further
that
the
duty
of
the
ugly
when
admitted
in
art
is
to
contribute
towards
heightening
the
effect
of
the
beautiful
sympathetic
by
producing
a
series
of
contrasts
from
which
the
pleasurable
shall
issue
more
efficacious
and
it
is
in
fact
a
common
observation
that
pleasure
is
more
vividly
felt
when
it
has
been
preceded
by
abstinence
or
by
suffering
thus
the
ugly
in
art
was
looked
upon
as
the
servant
of
the
beautiful
its
stimulant
and
condiment
that
special
theory
of
hedonistic
refinement
which
used
to
be
pompously
called
the
of
the
falls
with
the
general
theory
of
the
sympathetic
and
with
it
the
enumeration
and
the
definition
of
the
concepts
mentioned
above
remain
completely
excluded
from
aesthetic
for
aesthetic
does
not
recognize
the
sympathetic
or
the
antipathetic
in
their
varieties
but
only
the
spiritual
activity
of
the
representation
sidenote
concepts
belong
to
however
the
large
space
which
as
we
have
said
those
concepts
have
hitherto
occupied
in
aesthetic
treatises
makes
opportune
a
rather
more
copious
explanation
of
what
they
are
what
will
be
their
lot
as
they
are
excluded
from
aesthetic
in
what
other
part
of
philosophy
will
they
be
received
truly
in
none
all
those
concepts
are
without
philosophical
value
they
are
nothing
but
a
series
of
classes
which
can
be
bent
in
the
most
various
ways
and
multiplied
at
pleasure
to
which
it
is
sought
to
reduce
the
infinite
complications
and
shadings
of
the
values
and
disvalues
of
life
of
those
classes
there
are
some
that
have
an
especially
positive
significance
like
the
beautiful
the
sublime
the
majestic
the
solemn
the
serious
the
weighty
the
noble
the
elevated
others
have
a
significance
especially
negative
like
the
ugly
the
horrible
the
dreadful
the
tremendous
the
monstrous
the
foolish
the
extravagant
in
others
prevails
a
mixed
significance
as
is
the
case
with
the
comic
the
tender
the
melancholy
the
humorous
the
the
complications
are
infinite
because
the
individuations
are
infinite
hence
it
is
not
possible
to
construct
the
concepts
save
in
the
arbitrary
and
approximate
manner
of
the
natural
sciences
whose
duty
it
is
to
make
as
good
a
plan
as
possible
of
that
reality
which
they
can
not
exhaust
by
enumeration
nor
understand
and
surpass
speculatively
and
since
is
the
naturalistic
discipline
which
undertakes
to
construct
types
and
plans
of
the
spiritual
processes
of
man
of
which
in
fact
it
is
always
accentuating
in
our
day
the
merely
empirical
and
descriptive
character
these
concepts
do
not
appertain
to
aesthetic
nor
in
general
to
philosophy
they
must
simply
be
handed
over
to
psychology
sidenote
of
rigoristic
definitions
of
as
is
the
case
with
all
other
psychological
constructions
so
is
it
with
those
concepts
no
rigorous
definitions
are
possible
and
consequently
the
one
can
not
be
deduced
from
the
other
and
they
can
not
be
connected
in
a
system
as
has
nevertheless
often
been
attempted
at
great
waste
of
time
and
without
result
but
it
can
be
claimed
as
possible
to
obtain
apart
from
philosophical
definitions
recognised
as
impossible
empirical
definitions
universally
acceptable
as
true
since
there
does
not
exist
a
unique
definition
of
a
given
fact
but
innumerable
definitions
can
be
given
of
it
according
to
the
cases
and
the
objects
for
which
they
are
made
so
it
is
clear
that
if
there
were
only
one
and
that
the
true
one
this
would
no
longer
be
an
empirical
but
a
rigorous
and
philosophical
definition
speaking
exactly
every
time
that
one
of
the
terms
to
which
we
have
referred
has
been
employed
or
any
other
of
the
innumerable
series
a
definition
of
it
has
at
the
same
time
been
given
expressed
or
understood
and
each
one
of
these
definitions
has
differed
somewhat
from
the
others
in
some
particular
perhaps
of
very
small
importance
such
as
tacit
reference
to
some
individual
fact
or
other
which
thus
became
especially
an
object
of
attention
and
was
raised
to
the
position
of
a
general
type
so
it
happens
that
not
one
of
such
definitions
satisfies
him
who
hears
it
nor
does
it
satisfy
even
him
who
constructs
it
for
the
moment
after
this
same
individual
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
a
new
case
for
which
he
recognizes
that
his
definition
is
more
or
less
insufficient
and
in
need
of
remodelling
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
leave
writers
and
speakers
free
to
define
the
sublime
or
the
comic
the
tragic
or
the
humoristic
on
every
occasion
as
they
please
and
as
may
seem
suitable
to
their
purpose
and
if
you
insist
upon
obtaining
an
empirical
definition
of
universal
validity
we
can
but
submit
this
one
the
sublime
comic
tragic
humoristic
etc
is
that
is
or
will
be
so
by
those
who
have
employed
or
shall
employ
this
sidenote
definitions
of
the
sublime
the
comic
and
the
what
is
the
sublime
the
unexpected
affirmation
of
an
moral
force
that
is
one
definition
but
that
other
definition
is
equally
good
which
also
recognizes
the
sublime
where
the
force
which
declares
itself
is
an
but
immoral
and
destructive
will
both
remain
vague
and
assume
no
precise
form
until
they
are
applied
to
a
concrete
case
which
makes
clear
what
is
here
meant
by
and
what
by
they
are
quantitative
concepts
but
falsely
quantitative
since
there
is
no
way
of
measuring
them
they
are
at
bottom
metaphors
emphatic
phrases
or
logical
tautologies
the
humorous
will
be
laughter
mingled
with
tears
bitter
laughter
the
sudden
passage
from
the
comic
to
the
tragic
and
from
the
tragic
to
the
comic
the
comic
romantic
the
inverted
sublime
war
declared
against
every
attempt
at
insincerity
compassion
which
is
ashamed
to
lament
the
mockery
not
of
the
fact
but
of
the
ideal
itself
and
whatever
else
may
better
please
according
as
it
is
desired
to
get
a
view
of
the
physiognomy
of
this
or
that
poet
of
this
or
that
poem
which
is
in
its
uniqueness
its
own
definition
and
though
momentary
and
circumscribed
yet
the
sole
adequate
the
comic
has
been
defined
as
the
displeasure
arising
from
the
perception
of
a
deformity
immediately
followed
by
a
greater
pleasure
arising
from
the
relaxation
of
our
psychical
forces
which
were
strained
in
anticipation
of
a
perception
whose
importance
was
foreseen
while
listening
to
a
narrative
which
for
example
should
describe
the
magnificent
and
heroic
purpose
of
a
definite
person
we
anticipate
in
imagination
the
occurrence
of
an
action
both
heroic
and
magnificent
and
we
prepare
ourselves
to
receive
it
by
straining
our
psychic
forces
if
however
in
a
moment
instead
of
the
magnificent
and
heroic
action
which
the
premises
and
the
tone
of
the
narrative
had
led
us
to
expect
by
an
unexpected
change
there
occur
a
slight
mean
foolish
action
unequal
to
our
expectation
we
have
been
deceived
and
the
recognition
of
the
deceit
brings
with
it
an
instant
of
displeasure
but
this
instant
is
as
it
were
overcome
by
the
one
immediately
following
in
which
we
are
able
to
discard
our
strained
attention
to
free
ourselves
from
the
provision
of
psychic
energy
accumulated
and
henceforth
superfluous
to
feel
ourselves
reasonable
and
relieved
of
a
burden
this
is
the
pleasure
of
the
comic
with
its
physiological
equivalent
laughter
if
the
unpleasant
fact
that
has
occurred
should
painfully
affect
our
interests
pleasure
would
not
arise
laughter
would
be
at
once
choked
the
psychic
energy
would
be
strained
and
overstrained
by
other
more
serious
perceptions
if
on
the
other
hand
such
more
serious
perceptions
do
not
arise
if
the
whole
loss
be
limited
to
a
slight
deception
of
our
foresight
then
the
supervening
feeling
of
our
psychic
wealth
affords
ample
compensation
for
this
very
slight
this
stated
in
a
few
words
is
one
of
the
most
accurate
modern
definitions
of
the
comic
it
boasts
of
containing
justified
or
corrected
the
manifold
attempts
to
define
the
comic
from
hellenic
antiquity
to
our
own
day
it
includes
dictum
in
the
and
aristotle
which
is
more
explicit
the
latter
looks
upon
the
comic
as
an
without
it
contains
the
theory
of
hobbes
who
placed
it
in
the
feeling
of
of
kant
who
saw
in
it
a
of
and
those
of
other
thinkers
for
whom
it
was
contrast
between
great
and
small
between
the
finite
and
the
but
on
close
observation
the
analysis
and
definition
above
given
although
most
elaborate
and
rigorous
in
appearance
yet
enunciates
characteristics
which
are
applicable
not
only
to
the
comic
but
to
every
spiritual
process
such
as
the
succession
of
painful
and
agreeable
moments
and
the
satisfaction
arising
from
the
consciousness
of
force
and
of
its
free
development
the
differentiation
here
given
is
that
of
quantitative
determinations
to
which
limits
can
not
be
assigned
they
remain
vague
phrases
attaining
to
some
meaning
from
their
reference
to
this
or
that
single
comic
fact
if
such
definitions
be
taken
too
seriously
there
happens
to
them
what
jean
paul
richter
said
of
all
the
definitions
of
the
comic
namely
that
their
sole
merit
is
be
themselves
and
to
produce
in
reality
the
fact
which
they
vainly
try
to
define
logically
and
who
will
ever
determine
logically
the
dividing
line
between
the
comic
and
the
between
smiles
and
laughter
between
smiling
and
gravity
who
will
cut
into
clearly
divided
parts
that
continuity
into
which
life
melts
sidenote
between
those
concepts
and
aesthetic
the
facts
classified
as
well
as
possible
in
the
psychological
concepts
bear
no
relation
to
the
artistic
fact
beyond
the
generic
that
all
of
them
in
so
far
as
they
designate
the
material
of
life
can
be
represented
by
art
and
the
other
accidental
relation
that
aesthetic
facts
also
may
sometimes
enter
into
the
processes
described
as
in
the
impression
of
the
sublime
that
the
work
of
a
titanic
artist
such
as
dante
or
shakespeare
may
produce
and
that
of
the
comic
produced
by
the
effort
of
a
dauber
or
of
a
scribbler
the
process
is
external
to
the
aesthetic
fact
in
this
case
also
for
the
only
feeling
linked
with
that
is
the
feeling
of
aesthetic
value
and
disvalue
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
the
dantesque
farinata
is
aesthetically
beautiful
and
nothing
but
beautiful
if
in
addition
the
force
of
will
of
this
personage
appear
sublime
or
the
expression
that
dante
gives
him
by
reason
of
his
great
genius
seem
sublime
by
comparison
with
that
of
a
less
energetic
poet
all
this
is
not
a
matter
for
aesthetic
consideration
this
consists
always
and
only
in
adequation
to
truth
that
is
in
beauty
xiii
the
physically
beautiful
in
nature
and
art
sidenote
activity
and
physical
aesthetic
activity
is
distinct
from
practical
activity
but
when
it
expresses
itself
is
always
physical
accompanied
by
practical
activity
hence
its
utilitarian
or
hedonistic
side
and
the
pleasure
and
pain
which
are
as
it
were
the
practical
echo
of
aesthetic
values
and
disvalues
of
the
beautiful
and
of
the
ugly
but
this
practical
side
of
the
aesthetic
activity
has
also
in
its
turn
a
or
accompaniment
which
consists
of
sounds
tones
movements
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
and
so
on
does
it
possess
this
side
or
does
it
only
seem
to
possess
it
as
the
result
of
the
construction
which
we
raise
in
physical
science
and
of
the
useful
and
arbitrary
methods
which
we
have
shown
to
be
proper
to
the
empirical
and
abstract
sciences
our
reply
can
not
be
doubtful
that
is
it
can
not
be
affirmative
as
to
the
first
of
the
two
hypotheses
however
it
will
be
better
to
leave
it
at
this
point
in
suspense
for
it
is
not
at
present
necessary
to
prosecute
this
line
of
inquiry
any
further
the
mention
already
made
must
suffice
to
prevent
our
having
spoken
of
the
physical
element
as
of
something
objective
and
existing
for
reasons
of
simplicity
and
adhesion
to
ordinary
language
from
leading
to
hasty
conclusions
as
to
the
concepts
and
the
connexion
between
spirit
and
nature
sidenote
in
the
aesthetic
sense
and
expression
in
the
naturalistic
it
is
important
to
make
clear
that
as
the
existence
of
the
hedonistic
side
in
every
spiritual
activity
has
given
rise
to
the
confusion
between
the
aesthetic
activity
and
the
useful
or
pleasurable
so
the
existence
or
better
the
possibility
of
constructing
this
physical
side
has
generated
the
confusion
between
expression
and
expression
the
naturalistic
between
a
spiritual
fact
that
is
to
say
and
a
mechanical
and
passive
fact
not
to
say
between
a
concrete
reality
and
an
abstraction
or
fiction
in
common
speech
sometimes
it
is
the
words
of
the
poet
that
are
called
the
notes
of
the
musician
or
the
figures
of
the
painter
sometimes
the
blush
which
is
wont
to
accompany
the
feeling
of
shame
the
pallor
resulting
from
fear
the
grinding
of
the
teeth
proper
to
violent
anger
the
glittering
of
the
eyes
and
certain
movements
of
the
muscles
of
the
mouth
which
reveal
cheerfulness
a
certain
degree
of
heat
is
also
said
to
be
the
of
fever
as
the
falling
of
the
barometer
is
of
rain
and
even
that
the
height
of
the
rate
of
exchange
the
discredit
of
the
of
a
state
or
social
discontent
the
approach
of
a
revolution
one
can
well
imagine
what
sort
of
scientific
results
would
be
attained
by
allowing
oneself
to
be
governed
by
linguistic
usage
and
placing
in
one
sheaf
facts
so
widely
different
but
there
is
in
fact
an
abyss
between
a
man
who
is
the
prey
of
anger
with
all
its
natural
manifestations
and
another
man
who
expresses
it
aesthetically
between
the
aspect
the
cries
and
the
contortions
of
one
who
is
tortured
with
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
a
dear
one
and
the
words
or
song
with
which
the
same
individual
portrays
his
torture
at
another
moment
between
the
distortion
of
emotion
and
the
gesture
of
the
actor
darwin
book
on
the
expression
of
the
feelings
in
man
and
animals
does
not
belong
to
aesthetic
because
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
the
science
of
spiritual
expression
and
a
whether
it
be
medical
meteorological
political
physiognomic
or
chiromantic
expression
in
the
naturalistic
sense
simply
lacks
expression
in
the
spiritual
sense
that
is
to
say
the
characteristic
itself
of
activity
and
of
spirituality
and
therefore
the
bipartition
into
poles
of
beauty
and
of
ugliness
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
relation
between
cause
and
effect
fixed
by
the
abstract
intellect
the
complete
process
of
aesthetic
production
can
be
symbolized
in
four
steps
which
are
impressions
expression
or
spiritual
aesthetic
synthesis
hedonistic
accompaniment
or
pleasure
of
the
beautiful
aesthetic
pleasure
translation
of
the
aesthetic
fact
into
physical
phenomena
sounds
tones
movements
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
anyone
can
see
that
the
capital
point
the
only
one
that
is
properly
speaking
aesthetic
and
truly
real
is
in
that
which
is
lacking
to
the
mere
manifestation
or
naturalistic
construction
metaphorically
also
called
expression
the
expressive
process
is
exhausted
when
those
four
steps
have
been
taken
it
begins
again
with
new
impressions
a
new
aesthetic
synthesis
and
relative
accompaniments
sidenote
and
expressions
or
representations
follow
and
expel
one
another
certainly
this
passing
away
this
disassociation
is
not
perishing
it
is
not
total
elimination
nothing
of
what
is
born
dies
with
that
complete
death
which
would
be
identical
with
never
having
been
born
though
all
things
pass
away
yet
none
can
die
the
representations
which
we
have
forgotten
also
persist
in
some
way
in
our
spirit
for
without
them
we
could
not
explain
acquired
habits
and
capacities
thus
the
strength
of
life
lies
in
this
apparent
forgetting
one
forgets
what
has
been
absorbed
and
what
life
has
superseded
but
many
other
things
many
other
representations
are
still
efficacious
elements
in
the
actual
processes
of
our
spirit
and
it
is
incumbent
on
us
not
to
forget
them
or
to
be
capable
of
recalling
them
when
necessity
demands
them
the
will
is
always
vigilant
in
this
work
of
preservation
for
it
aims
at
preserving
so
to
say
the
greater
and
more
fundamental
part
of
all
our
riches
certainly
its
vigilance
is
not
always
sufficient
memory
we
know
leaves
or
betrays
us
in
various
ways
for
this
very
reason
the
vigilant
will
excogitates
expedients
which
help
memory
in
its
weakness
and
are
its
sidenote
production
of
aids
to
we
have
already
explained
how
these
aids
are
possible
expressions
or
representations
are
at
the
same
time
practical
facts
which
are
also
called
physical
facts
in
so
far
as
to
the
physical
belongs
the
task
of
classifying
them
and
reducing
them
to
types
now
it
is
clear
that
if
we
can
succeed
in
making
those
facts
in
some
way
permanent
it
will
always
be
possible
other
conditions
remaining
equal
to
reproduce
in
us
by
perceiving
it
the
already
produced
expression
or
intuition
if
that
in
which
the
practical
concomitant
acts
or
to
use
physical
terms
the
movements
have
been
isolated
and
made
in
some
sort
permanent
be
called
the
object
or
physical
stimulus
and
if
it
be
designated
by
the
letter
then
the
process
of
reproduction
will
take
place
in
the
following
order
the
physical
stimulus
perceptions
of
physical
facts
sounds
tones
mimic
combinations
of
lines
and
colours
etc
which
form
together
the
aesthetic
synthesis
already
produced
the
hedonistic
accompaniment
which
is
also
reproduced
and
what
are
those
combinations
of
words
which
are
called
poetry
prose
poems
novels
romances
tragedies
or
comedies
but
stimulants
of
the
stage
what
are
those
combinations
of
sound
which
are
called
operas
symphonies
sonatas
and
what
those
of
lines
and
of
colours
which
are
called
pictures
statues
architecture
the
spiritual
energy
of
memory
with
the
assistance
of
those
physical
facts
above
mentioned
makes
possible
the
preservation
and
the
reproduction
of
the
intuitions
produced
often
so
laboriously
by
ourselves
and
by
others
if
the
physiological
organism
and
with
it
memory
become
weakened
if
the
monuments
of
art
be
destroyed
then
all
the
aesthetic
wealth
the
fruit
of
the
labours
of
many
generations
becomes
lessened
and
rapidly
disappears
sidenote
physically
monuments
of
art
which
are
the
stimulants
of
aesthetic
reproduction
are
called
things
or
the
physically
this
combination
of
words
constitutes
a
verbal
paradox
because
the
beautiful
is
not
a
physical
fact
it
does
not
belong
to
things
but
to
the
activity
of
man
to
spiritual
energy
but
henceforth
it
is
clear
through
what
wanderings
and
what
abbreviations
physical
things
and
facts
which
are
simply
aids
to
the
reproduction
of
the
beautiful
end
by
being
called
elliptically
beautiful
things
and
physically
beautiful
and
now
that
we
have
made
the
existence
of
this
ellipse
clear
we
shall
ourselves
make
use
of
it
without
hesitation
sidenote
and
form
another
the
intervention
of
the
physically
beautiful
serves
to
explain
another
meaning
of
the
words
and
as
employed
by
aestheticians
some
call
content
the
internal
fact
or
expression
which
is
for
us
already
form
and
they
call
form
the
marble
the
colours
the
rhythm
the
sounds
for
us
form
no
longer
thus
they
look
upon
the
physical
fact
as
the
form
which
may
or
may
not
be
joined
to
the
content
this
serves
to
explain
another
aspect
of
what
is
called
aesthetic
ugliness
he
who
has
nothing
definite
to
express
may
try
to
hide
his
internal
emptiness
with
a
flood
of
words
with
sounding
verse
with
deafening
polyphony
with
painting
that
dazzles
the
eye
or
by
collocating
great
architectonic
masses
which
arrest
and
disturb
although
at
bottom
they
convey
nothing
ugliness
then
is
the
arbitrary
the
charlatanesque
and
in
reality
if
the
practical
will
do
not
intervene
in
the
theoretic
function
there
may
be
absence
of
beauty
but
never
effective
presence
of
the
ugly
sidenote
and
artificial
physical
beauty
is
wont
to
be
divided
into
and
beauty
thus
we
reach
one
of
the
facts
which
has
given
great
labour
to
thinkers
beautiful
in
these
words
often
designate
simply
facts
of
practical
pleasure
he
alludes
to
nothing
aesthetic
who
calls
a
landscape
beautiful
where
the
eye
rests
upon
verdure
where
bodily
motion
is
easy
and
where
the
warm
envelops
and
caresses
the
limbs
but
it
is
nevertheless
indubitable
that
on
other
occasions
the
adjective
beautiful
applied
to
objects
and
scenes
existing
in
nature
has
a
completely
aesthetic
signification
it
has
been
observed
that
in
order
to
enjoy
natural
objects
aesthetically
we
should
withdraw
them
from
their
external
and
historical
reality
and
separate
their
simple
appearance
or
origin
from
existence
that
if
we
contemplate
a
landscape
with
our
head
between
our
legs
in
such
a
way
as
to
remove
ourselves
from
our
wonted
relations
with
it
the
landscape
appears
as
an
ideal
spectacle
that
nature
is
beautiful
only
for
him
who
contemplates
her
the
eye
of
the
that
zoologists
and
botanists
do
not
recognize
beautiful
animals
and
flowers
that
natural
beauty
is
and
examples
of
discovery
are
the
points
of
view
pointed
out
by
men
of
taste
and
imagination
and
to
which
more
or
less
aesthetic
travellers
and
excursionists
afterwards
have
recourse
in
pilgrimage
whence
a
more
or
less
collective
that
the
aid
of
the
no
part
of
nature
is
beautiful
and
that
with
such
aid
the
same
natural
object
or
fact
is
now
expressive
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
soul
now
insignificant
now
expressive
of
one
definite
thing
now
of
another
sad
or
glad
sublime
or
ridiculous
sweet
or
laughable
finally
that
which
an
artist
would
not
some
extent
correct
does
not
all
these
observations
are
most
just
and
confirm
the
fact
that
natural
beauty
is
simply
a
to
aesthetic
reproduction
which
presupposes
previous
production
without
preceding
aesthetic
intuitions
of
the
imagination
nature
can
not
arouse
any
at
all
as
regards
natural
beauty
man
is
like
the
mythical
narcissus
at
the
fountain
they
show
further
that
since
this
stimulus
is
accidental
it
is
for
the
most
part
imperfect
or
equivocal
leopardi
said
that
natural
beauty
is
rare
scattered
and
fugitive
every
one
refers
the
natural
fact
to
the
expression
which
is
in
his
mind
one
artist
is
as
it
were
carried
away
by
a
laughing
landscape
another
by
a
another
by
the
pretty
face
of
a
young
girl
another
by
the
squalid
countenance
of
an
old
ruffian
perhaps
the
first
will
say
that
the
and
the
ugly
face
of
the
old
ruffian
are
the
second
that
the
laughing
landscape
and
the
face
of
the
young
girl
are
they
may
dispute
for
ever
but
they
will
never
agree
save
when
they
have
supplied
themselves
with
a
sufficient
dose
of
aesthetic
knowledge
which
will
enable
them
to
recognize
that
they
are
both
right
beauty
created
by
man
is
a
much
more
ductile
and
efficacious
aid
to
reproduction
sidenote
in
addition
to
these
two
classes
aestheticians
also
sometimes
talk
in
their
treatises
of
a
beauty
of
what
is
it
a
mixture
just
of
natural
and
artificial
whoso
fixes
and
externalizes
operates
with
natural
materials
which
he
does
not
create
but
combines
and
transforms
in
this
sense
every
artificial
product
is
a
mixture
of
nature
and
artifice
and
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
speak
of
a
mixed
beauty
as
of
a
special
category
but
it
happens
that
in
certain
cases
combinations
already
given
in
nature
can
be
used
a
great
deal
more
than
in
others
as
for
instance
when
we
design
a
beautiful
garden
and
include
in
our
design
groups
of
trees
or
ponds
which
are
already
there
on
other
occasions
externalization
is
limited
by
the
impossibility
of
producing
certain
effects
artificially
thus
we
may
mix
the
colouring
matters
but
we
can
not
create
a
powerful
voice
or
a
personage
and
an
appearance
appropriate
to
this
or
that
personage
of
a
drama
we
must
therefore
seek
for
them
among
things
already
existing
and
make
use
of
them
when
we
find
them
when
therefore
we
adopt
a
great
number
of
combinations
already
existing
in
nature
such
as
we
should
not
be
able
to
produce
artificially
if
they
did
not
exist
the
result
is
called
beauty
sidenote
we
must
distinguish
from
artificial
beauty
those
instruments
of
reproduction
called
such
as
alphabets
musical
notes
hieroglyphics
and
all
from
the
language
of
flowers
and
flags
to
the
language
of
patches
so
much
the
vogue
in
the
society
of
the
eighteenth
century
writings
are
not
physical
facts
which
arouse
directly
impressions
answering
to
aesthetic
expressions
they
are
simple
of
what
must
be
done
in
order
to
produce
such
physical
facts
a
series
of
graphic
signs
serves
to
remind
us
of
the
movements
which
we
must
execute
with
our
vocal
apparatus
in
order
to
emit
certain
definite
sounds
if
through
practice
we
become
able
to
hear
the
words
without
opening
our
mouths
and
what
is
much
more
difficult
to
hear
the
sounds
by
running
the
eye
down
the
page
of
the
music
all
this
does
not
alter
anything
of
the
nature
of
the
writings
which
are
altogether
different
from
direct
physical
beauty
no
one
calls
the
book
which
contains
the
or
the
portfolio
which
contains
beautiful
in
the
same
sense
as
the
block
of
marble
which
contains
michael
angelo
or
the
piece
of
coloured
wood
which
contains
the
are
metaphorically
called
beautiful
both
serve
for
the
reproduction
of
the
beautiful
but
the
former
by
a
far
longer
and
far
more
indirect
route
than
the
latter
sidenote
beautiful
as
free
and
not
another
division
of
the
beautiful
which
is
still
found
in
treatises
is
that
into
and
not
by
beauties
that
are
not
free
are
understood
those
objects
which
have
to
serve
a
double
purpose
and
aesthetic
stimulants
of
intuitions
and
since
it
appears
that
the
first
purpose
limits
and
impedes
the
second
the
beautiful
object
resulting
therefrom
has
been
considered
as
a
beauty
that
is
not
free
architectural
works
are
especially
cited
and
precisely
for
this
reason
has
architecture
often
been
excluded
from
the
number
of
the
fine
arts
a
temple
must
be
above
all
things
adapted
to
the
use
of
a
cult
a
house
must
contain
all
the
rooms
requisite
for
commodity
of
living
and
they
must
be
arranged
with
a
view
to
this
commodity
a
fortress
must
be
a
construction
capable
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
certain
armies
and
the
blows
of
certain
instruments
of
war
it
is
therefore
held
that
the
architect
field
is
limited
he
may
be
able
to
to
some
extent
the
temple
the
house
the
fortress
but
his
hands
are
bound
by
the
of
these
buildings
and
he
can
only
manifest
that
part
of
his
vision
of
beauty
in
their
construction
which
does
not
impair
their
extrinsic
but
fundamental
objects
other
examples
are
taken
from
what
is
called
art
applied
to
industry
plates
glasses
knives
guns
and
combs
can
be
made
beautiful
but
it
is
held
that
their
beauty
must
not
so
far
exceed
as
to
prevent
our
eating
from
the
plate
drinking
from
the
glass
cutting
with
the
knife
firing
off
the
gun
or
combing
one
hair
with
the
comb
the
same
is
said
of
the
art
of
printing
a
book
should
be
beautiful
but
not
to
the
extent
of
its
being
difficult
or
impossible
to
read
it
sidenote
of
the
beautiful
that
is
not
in
respect
to
all
this
we
must
observe
in
the
first
place
that
the
external
purpose
precisely
because
it
is
such
does
not
of
necessity
limit
or
trammel
the
other
purpose
of
being
a
stimulus
to
aesthetic
reproduction
nothing
therefore
can
be
more
erroneous
than
the
thesis
that
architecture
for
example
is
by
its
nature
not
free
and
imperfect
since
it
must
also
fulfil
other
practical
objects
beautiful
architectural
works
however
themselves
undertake
to
deny
this
by
their
simple
presence
in
the
second
place
not
only
are
the
two
objects
not
necessarily
in
opposition
but
we
must
add
the
artist
always
has
the
means
of
preventing
this
contradiction
from
taking
place
in
what
way
by
taking
as
the
material
of
his
intuition
and
aesthetic
externalization
precisely
the
of
the
object
which
serves
a
practical
end
he
will
not
need
to
add
anything
to
the
object
in
order
to
make
it
the
instrument
of
aesthetic
intuitions
it
will
be
so
if
perfectly
adapted
to
its
practical
purpose
rustic
dwellings
and
palaces
churches
and
barracks
swords
and
ploughs
are
beautiful
not
in
so
far
as
they
are
embellished
and
adorned
but
in
so
far
as
they
express
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
made
a
garment
is
only
beautiful
because
it
is
quite
suitable
to
a
given
person
in
given
conditions
the
sword
bound
to
the
side
of
the
warrior
rinaldo
by
the
amorous
armida
was
not
beautiful
so
adorned
that
it
seemed
a
useless
ornament
not
the
warlike
instrument
of
a
warrior
it
was
beautiful
if
you
will
in
the
eyes
and
imagination
of
the
sorceress
who
loved
her
lover
in
this
effeminate
way
the
aesthetic
fact
can
always
accompany
the
practical
fact
because
expression
is
truth
it
can
not
however
be
denied
that
aesthetic
contemplation
sometimes
hinders
practical
use
for
instance
it
is
a
quite
common
experience
to
find
certain
new
things
so
well
adapted
to
their
purpose
and
yet
so
beautiful
that
people
occasionally
feel
scruples
in
maltreating
them
by
using
after
contemplating
them
which
amounts
to
consuming
them
it
was
for
this
reason
that
king
frederick
william
of
prussia
evinced
repugnance
to
ordering
his
magnificent
grenadiers
so
well
suited
for
war
to
endure
the
strain
of
battle
but
his
less
aesthetic
son
frederick
the
great
obtained
from
them
excellent
services
sidenote
stimulants
of
it
might
be
objected
to
the
explanation
of
the
physically
beautiful
as
a
simple
adjunct
for
the
reproduction
of
the
internally
beautiful
that
is
to
say
of
expressions
that
the
artist
creates
his
expressions
by
painting
or
by
sculpturing
by
writing
or
by
composing
and
that
therefore
the
physically
beautiful
instead
of
following
sometimes
precedes
the
aesthetically
beautiful
this
would
be
a
somewhat
superficial
mode
of
understanding
the
procedure
of
the
artist
who
never
makes
a
stroke
with
his
brush
without
having
previously
seen
it
with
his
imagination
and
if
he
has
not
yet
seen
it
he
will
make
the
stroke
not
in
order
to
externalize
his
expression
which
does
not
yet
exist
but
as
though
to
have
a
rallying
point
for
ulterior
meditation
and
for
internal
concentration
the
physical
point
on
which
he
leans
is
not
the
physically
beautiful
instrument
of
reproduction
but
what
may
be
called
a
pedagogic
means
similar
to
retiring
into
solitude
or
to
the
many
other
expedients
frequently
very
strange
adopted
by
artists
and
philosophers
who
vary
in
these
according
to
their
various
idiosyncrasies
the
old
aesthetician
baumgarten
advised
poets
to
ride
on
horseback
as
a
means
of
inspiration
to
drink
wine
in
moderation
and
provided
they
were
chaste
to
look
at
beautiful
women
xiv
mistakes
arising
from
the
confusion
between
physic
and
aesthetic
it
is
necessary
to
mention
a
series
of
scientific
mistakes
which
have
arisen
from
the
failure
to
understand
the
purely
external
relation
between
the
aesthetic
fact
or
artistic
vision
and
the
physical
fact
or
instrument
which
serves
as
an
aid
to
reproduce
it
we
must
here
indicate
the
proper
criticism
which
derives
from
what
has
already
been
said
sidenote
of
aesthetic
that
form
of
associationism
which
identifies
the
aesthetic
fact
with
the
of
images
finds
a
place
among
these
errors
by
what
path
has
it
been
possible
to
arrive
at
such
a
mistake
against
which
our
aesthetic
consciousness
which
is
a
consciousness
of
perfect
unity
never
of
duality
rebels
just
because
the
physical
and
the
aesthetic
facts
have
been
considered
separately
as
two
distinct
images
which
enter
the
spirit
the
one
drawn
forth
from
the
other
the
one
first
and
the
other
afterwards
a
picture
is
divided
into
the
image
of
the
and
the
image
of
the
of
the
picture
a
poem
into
the
image
of
the
words
and
the
image
of
the
of
the
words
but
this
dualism
of
images
is
the
physical
fact
does
not
enter
the
spirit
as
an
image
but
causes
the
reproduction
of
the
image
the
only
image
which
is
the
aesthetic
fact
in
so
far
as
it
blindly
stimulates
the
psychic
organism
and
produces
an
impression
answering
to
the
aesthetic
expression
already
produced
the
efforts
of
the
associationists
the
usurpers
of
in
the
field
of
aesthetic
to
emerge
from
the
difficulty
and
to
reaffirm
in
some
way
the
unity
which
has
been
destroyed
by
their
principle
of
associationism
are
highly
instructive
some
maintain
that
the
image
called
back
again
is
unconscious
others
leaving
unconsciousness
alone
hold
that
on
the
contrary
it
is
vague
vaporous
confused
thus
reducing
the
of
the
aesthetic
fact
to
the
of
bad
memory
but
the
dilemma
is
inexorable
either
keep
association
and
give
up
unity
or
keep
unity
and
give
up
association
no
third
way
out
of
the
difficulty
exists
sidenote
of
aesthetic
from
the
failure
to
analyze
natural
beauty
thoroughly
and
to
recognize
that
it
is
simply
an
incident
of
aesthetic
reproduction
and
from
having
on
the
contrary
looked
upon
it
as
given
in
nature
is
derived
all
that
portion
of
treatises
upon
aesthetic
which
is
entitled
beautiful
in
nature
or
aesthetic
sometimes
even
subdivided
save
the
mark
into
aesthetic
mineralogy
botany
and
zoology
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
such
treatises
contain
many
just
remarks
and
are
sometimes
themselves
works
of
art
in
so
far
as
they
represent
beautifully
the
imaginings
and
fantasies
that
is
the
impressions
of
their
authors
but
we
must
state
that
it
is
scientifically
false
to
ask
oneself
if
the
dog
be
beautiful
and
the
ornithorhynchus
ugly
if
the
lily
be
beautiful
and
the
artichoke
ugly
indeed
the
error
is
here
double
on
one
hand
aesthetic
physic
falls
back
into
the
equivoke
of
the
theory
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
by
attempting
to
determine
aesthetically
the
abstractions
of
our
intellect
on
the
other
fails
to
recognize
as
we
said
the
true
formation
of
natural
beauty
for
which
the
question
as
to
whether
some
given
individual
animal
flower
or
man
be
beautiful
or
ugly
is
altogether
excluded
what
is
not
produced
by
the
aesthetic
spirit
or
can
not
be
referred
to
it
is
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
the
aesthetic
process
arises
from
the
ideal
relations
in
which
natural
objects
are
arranged
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
beauty
of
the
human
the
double
error
can
be
exemplified
by
the
question
upon
which
whole
volumes
have
been
written
as
to
the
of
the
human
here
it
is
necessary
above
all
things
to
urge
those
who
discuss
this
subject
from
the
abstract
toward
the
concrete
by
asking
what
do
you
mean
by
the
human
body
that
of
the
male
of
the
female
or
of
the
androgyne
let
us
assume
that
they
reply
by
dividing
the
inquiry
into
two
distinct
inquiries
as
to
the
virile
and
feminine
beauty
there
really
are
writers
who
seriously
discuss
whether
man
or
woman
is
the
more
beautiful
and
let
us
continue
masculine
or
feminine
beauty
but
of
what
race
of
men
the
white
the
yellow
or
the
black
and
whatever
others
there
may
be
according
to
the
division
of
races
let
us
assume
that
they
limit
themselves
to
the
white
race
and
let
us
continue
what
of
the
white
race
and
when
we
have
restricted
them
gradually
to
one
section
of
the
white
world
that
is
to
say
to
the
italian
tuscan
siennese
or
porta
camollia
section
we
will
continue
very
good
but
at
what
age
of
the
human
body
and
in
what
condition
and
state
of
development
that
of
the
babe
of
the
child
of
the
boy
of
the
adolescent
of
the
man
of
middle
age
and
so
on
and
is
the
man
at
rest
or
at
work
or
is
he
occupied
as
is
paul
potter
cow
or
the
ganymede
of
rembrandt
having
thus
arrived
by
successive
reductions
at
the
individual
or
better
at
the
man
pointed
out
with
the
finger
it
will
be
easy
to
expose
the
other
error
by
recalling
what
has
been
said
about
the
natural
fact
which
is
now
beautiful
now
ugly
according
to
the
point
of
view
according
to
what
is
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
artist
finally
if
the
gulf
of
naples
have
its
detractors
and
if
there
be
artists
who
declare
it
inexpressive
preferring
the
gloomy
firs
the
clouds
and
perpetual
north
winds
of
the
northern
seas
let
it
be
believed
if
possible
that
such
relativity
does
not
exist
for
the
human
body
source
of
the
most
various
suggestions
sidenote
of
the
beauty
of
geometric
the
question
of
the
of
geometrical
is
connected
with
aesthetic
physic
but
if
by
geometrical
figures
be
understood
the
concepts
of
geometry
the
concept
of
the
triangle
the
square
the
cone
these
are
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
they
are
concepts
if
on
the
other
hand
by
such
figures
be
understood
bodies
which
possess
definite
geometrical
forms
these
will
be
ugly
or
beautiful
like
every
natural
fact
according
to
the
ideal
connexions
in
which
they
are
placed
some
hold
that
those
geometrical
figures
are
beautiful
which
point
upwards
since
they
give
the
suggestion
of
firmness
and
of
force
it
is
not
denied
that
such
may
be
the
case
but
neither
must
it
be
denied
that
those
also
which
give
the
impression
of
instability
and
of
being
crushed
down
may
possess
their
beauty
where
they
represent
just
the
and
the
crushed
and
that
in
these
last
cases
the
firmness
of
the
straight
line
and
the
lightness
of
the
cone
or
of
the
equilateral
triangle
would
on
the
contrary
seem
elements
of
ugliness
certainly
such
questions
as
to
the
beauty
of
nature
and
the
beauty
of
geometry
like
the
others
analogous
of
the
historically
beautiful
and
of
human
beauty
seem
less
absurd
in
the
aesthetic
of
the
sympathetic
which
means
at
bottom
by
the
words
aesthetic
beauty
the
representation
of
what
is
pleasing
but
the
pretension
to
determine
scientifically
what
are
the
sympathetic
contents
and
what
are
the
irremediably
antipathetic
is
none
the
less
erroneous
even
in
the
sphere
of
that
doctrine
and
after
the
laying
down
of
those
premises
one
can
only
answer
such
questions
by
repeating
with
an
infinitely
long
postscript
the
of
the
first
ode
of
the
first
book
of
horace
and
the
of
leopardi
letter
to
carlo
pepoli
to
each
man
his
beautiful
sympathetic
as
to
each
man
his
fair
one
philography
is
not
a
science
sidenote
of
another
aspect
of
the
imitation
of
the
artist
sometimes
has
naturally
existing
facts
before
him
in
producing
the
artificial
instrument
or
physically
beautiful
these
are
called
his
bodies
stuffs
flowers
and
so
on
let
us
run
over
the
sketches
the
studies
and
the
notes
of
the
artists
leonardo
noted
down
in
his
when
he
was
working
on
the
last
supper
giovannina
fantastic
appearance
is
at
catherine
at
the
hospital
cristofano
di
castiglione
is
at
the
pietà
he
has
a
fine
head
christ
giovan
conte
is
of
the
suite
of
cardinal
mortaro
and
so
on
from
this
comes
the
illusion
that
the
artist
when
it
would
perhaps
be
more
exact
to
say
that
nature
imitates
the
artist
and
obeys
him
the
theory
that
imitates
has
sometimes
been
grounded
upon
and
found
sustenance
in
this
illusion
as
also
its
variant
more
easily
to
be
defended
which
makes
art
the
of
this
last
theory
presents
the
process
in
a
disorderly
manner
indeed
inversely
to
the
true
order
for
the
artist
does
not
proceed
from
extrinsic
reality
in
order
to
modify
it
by
approaching
it
to
the
ideal
but
he
proceeds
from
the
impression
of
external
nature
to
expression
that
is
to
say
to
his
ideal
and
from
this
he
passes
to
the
natural
fact
which
he
employs
as
the
instrument
of
reproduction
of
the
ideal
fact
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
elementary
forms
of
the
another
consequence
of
the
confusion
between
the
aesthetic
and
the
physical
fact
is
the
theory
of
the
forms
of
the
if
expression
if
the
beautiful
be
indivisible
the
physical
fact
in
which
it
externalizes
itself
can
well
be
divided
and
subdivided
for
example
a
painted
surface
into
lines
and
colours
groups
and
curves
of
lines
kinds
of
colours
and
so
on
a
poem
into
strophes
verses
feet
syllables
a
piece
of
prose
into
chapters
paragraphs
headings
periods
phrases
words
and
so
on
the
parts
thus
obtained
are
not
aesthetic
facts
but
smaller
physical
facts
cut
up
in
an
arbitrary
manner
if
this
path
were
followed
and
the
confusion
persisted
in
we
should
end
by
concluding
that
the
true
forms
of
the
beautiful
are
the
aesthetic
law
several
times
promulgated
that
beauty
must
have
could
be
invoked
against
the
atoms
it
can
not
be
the
imperceptibility
of
the
too
small
nor
the
unapprehensibility
of
the
too
large
but
a
bigness
which
depends
upon
perceptibility
not
measurement
derives
from
a
concept
widely
different
from
the
mathematical
for
what
is
called
imperceptible
and
incomprehensible
does
not
produce
an
impression
because
it
is
not
a
real
fact
but
a
concept
the
requisite
of
bulk
in
the
beautiful
is
thus
reduced
to
the
effective
reality
of
the
physical
fact
which
serves
for
the
reproduction
of
the
beautiful
sidenote
of
the
search
for
the
objective
conditions
of
the
continuing
the
search
for
the
or
for
the
conditions
of
the
it
has
been
asked
to
what
physical
facts
does
the
beautiful
correspond
to
what
the
ugly
to
what
unions
of
tones
colours
sizes
mathematically
determinable
such
inquiries
are
as
if
in
political
economy
one
were
to
seek
for
the
laws
of
exchange
in
the
physical
nature
of
the
objects
exchanged
the
constant
infecundity
of
the
attempt
should
have
at
once
given
rise
to
some
suspicion
as
to
its
vanity
in
our
times
especially
has
the
necessity
for
an
aesthetic
been
often
proclaimed
of
an
aesthetic
starting
which
should
proceed
like
natural
science
and
not
hasten
its
conclusions
inductive
but
aesthetic
has
always
been
both
inductive
and
deductive
like
every
philosophical
science
induction
and
deduction
can
not
be
separated
nor
can
they
separately
avail
to
characterize
a
true
science
but
the
word
inductive
was
not
here
pronounced
accidentally
and
without
special
intention
it
was
wished
to
imply
by
its
use
that
the
aesthetic
fact
is
nothing
at
bottom
but
a
physical
fact
which
should
be
studied
by
applying
to
it
the
methods
proper
to
the
physical
and
natural
sciences
with
such
a
presupposition
and
in
such
a
faith
did
inductive
aesthetic
or
aesthetic
of
the
inferior
what
pride
in
this
modesty
begin
its
labours
it
has
conscientiously
begun
by
making
a
collection
of
for
example
of
a
great
number
of
envelopes
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
and
has
asked
which
of
these
give
the
impression
of
the
beautiful
and
which
of
the
ugly
as
was
to
be
expected
the
inductive
aestheticians
speedily
found
themselves
in
a
difficulty
for
the
same
objects
that
appeared
ugly
in
one
aspect
would
appear
beautiful
in
another
a
yellow
coarse
envelope
which
would
be
extremely
ugly
for
the
purpose
of
enclosing
a
is
however
just
what
is
wanted
for
a
writ
served
by
process
on
stamped
paper
this
in
its
turn
would
look
very
bad
or
seem
at
any
rate
an
irony
if
enclosed
in
a
square
english
envelope
such
considerations
of
simple
common
sense
should
have
sufficed
to
convince
inductive
aestheticians
that
the
beautiful
has
no
physical
existence
and
cause
them
to
remit
their
vain
and
ridiculous
quest
but
no
they
have
had
recourse
to
an
expedient
as
to
which
we
would
find
it
difficult
to
say
how
far
it
belongs
to
natural
science
they
have
sent
their
envelopes
round
from
one
to
the
other
and
opened
a
thus
striving
to
decide
by
the
votes
of
the
majority
in
what
consists
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
we
will
not
waste
time
over
this
argument
because
we
should
seem
to
be
turning
ourselves
into
narrators
of
comic
anecdotes
rather
than
expositors
of
aesthetic
science
and
of
its
problems
it
is
an
actual
fact
that
the
inductive
aestheticians
have
not
yet
discovered
single
sidenote
of
he
who
dispenses
with
doctors
is
prone
to
abandon
himself
to
charlatans
thus
it
has
befallen
those
who
have
believed
in
the
natural
laws
of
the
beautiful
artists
sometimes
adopt
empirical
canons
such
as
that
of
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
or
of
the
golden
section
that
is
to
say
of
a
line
divided
into
two
parts
in
such
a
manner
that
the
less
is
to
the
greater
as
is
the
greater
to
the
whole
line
such
canons
easily
become
their
superstitions
and
they
attribute
to
such
the
success
of
their
works
thus
michael
angelo
left
as
a
precept
to
his
disciple
marco
del
pino
of
siena
that
he
should
always
make
a
pyramidal
serpentine
figure
multiplied
by
one
two
three
a
precept
which
did
not
enable
marco
di
siena
to
emerge
from
that
mediocrity
which
we
can
yet
observe
in
his
many
works
here
in
naples
others
extracted
from
the
sayings
of
michael
angelo
the
precept
that
serpentine
undulating
lines
were
the
true
of
whole
volumes
have
been
composed
on
these
laws
of
beauty
on
the
golden
section
and
on
the
undulating
and
serpentine
lines
these
should
in
our
opinion
be
looked
upon
as
the
of
xv
the
activity
of
externalization
technique
and
the
theory
of
the
arts
sidenote
practical
activity
of
the
fact
of
the
production
of
the
physically
beautiful
implies
as
has
already
been
remarked
a
vigilant
will
which
persists
in
not
allowing
certain
visions
intuitions
or
representations
to
be
lost
such
a
will
must
be
able
to
act
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
as
it
were
instinctively
and
also
be
capable
of
long
and
laborious
deliberations
thus
and
only
thus
does
the
practical
activity
enter
into
relations
with
the
aesthetic
that
is
to
say
in
effecting
the
production
of
physical
objects
which
are
aids
to
memory
here
it
is
not
merely
a
concomitant
but
really
a
distinct
moment
of
the
aesthetic
activity
we
can
not
will
or
not
will
our
aesthetic
vision
we
can
however
will
or
not
will
to
externalize
it
or
better
to
preserve
and
communicate
or
not
to
others
the
externalization
produced
sidenote
technique
of
this
volitional
fact
of
externalization
is
preceded
by
a
complex
of
various
kinds
of
knowledge
these
are
known
as
like
all
knowledge
which
precedes
the
practical
activity
thus
we
talk
of
an
artistic
technique
in
the
same
metaphorical
and
elliptic
manner
that
we
talk
of
the
physically
beautiful
that
is
to
say
in
more
precise
language
employed
by
the
practical
activity
engaged
in
producing
stimuli
to
aesthetic
in
place
of
employing
so
lengthy
a
phrase
we
shall
here
avail
ourselves
of
the
vulgar
terminology
since
we
are
henceforward
aware
of
its
true
meaning
the
possibility
of
this
technical
knowledge
at
the
service
of
artistic
reproduction
has
caused
people
to
imagine
the
existence
of
an
aesthetic
technique
of
internal
expression
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
doctrine
of
the
means
of
internal
which
is
altogether
inconceivable
and
we
know
well
the
reason
why
it
is
inconceivable
expression
considered
in
itself
is
primary
theoretic
activity
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
this
it
precedes
the
practical
activity
and
the
intellectual
knowledge
which
illumines
the
practical
activity
and
is
thus
independent
alike
of
the
one
and
of
the
other
it
also
helps
to
illumine
the
practical
activity
but
is
not
illuminated
by
it
expression
does
not
employ
because
it
has
not
an
it
has
intuitions
of
things
but
does
not
will
them
and
is
thus
indivisible
into
means
and
end
thus
if
it
be
said
as
sometimes
is
the
case
that
a
certain
writer
has
invented
a
new
technique
of
fiction
or
of
drama
or
that
a
painter
has
discovered
a
new
mode
of
distribution
of
light
the
word
is
used
in
a
false
sense
because
the
technique
is
really
that
romance
itself
or
that
new
itself
the
distribution
of
light
belongs
to
the
vision
itself
of
the
picture
as
the
technique
of
a
dramatist
is
his
dramatic
conception
itself
on
other
occasions
the
word
technique
is
used
to
designate
certain
merits
or
defects
in
a
work
which
is
a
failure
and
it
is
said
euphemistically
that
the
conception
is
bad
but
the
technique
good
or
that
the
conception
is
good
and
the
technique
bad
on
the
other
hand
when
the
different
ways
of
painting
in
oils
or
of
etching
or
of
sculpturing
in
alabaster
are
discussed
then
the
word
technique
is
in
its
place
but
in
such
a
case
the
adjective
artistic
is
used
metaphorically
and
if
a
dramatic
technique
in
the
artistic
sense
be
impossible
a
theatrical
technique
is
not
impossible
that
is
to
say
processes
of
externalization
of
certain
given
aesthetic
works
when
for
instance
women
were
introduced
on
the
stage
in
italy
in
the
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
place
of
men
dressed
as
women
this
was
a
true
and
real
discovery
in
theatrical
technique
such
too
was
the
perfecting
in
the
following
century
by
the
impresarios
of
venice
of
machines
for
the
rapid
changing
of
the
scenes
sidenote
theoretic
techniques
of
the
individual
the
collection
of
technical
knowledge
at
the
service
of
artists
desirous
of
externalizing
their
expressions
can
be
divided
into
groups
which
may
be
entitled
of
the
thus
is
born
a
theory
of
architecture
comprising
mechanical
laws
information
relating
to
the
weight
or
to
the
resistance
of
the
materials
of
construction
or
of
fortification
manuals
relating
to
the
method
of
mixing
chalk
or
stucco
a
theory
of
sculpture
containing
advice
as
to
the
instruments
to
be
used
for
sculpturing
the
various
sorts
of
stone
for
obtaining
a
successful
fusion
of
bronze
for
working
with
the
chisel
for
the
exact
copying
of
the
model
in
chalk
or
plaster
for
keeping
chalk
damp
a
theory
of
painting
on
the
various
techniques
of
tempera
of
of
of
pastel
on
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
on
the
laws
of
perspective
a
theory
of
oratory
with
precepts
as
to
the
method
of
producing
of
exercising
and
of
strengthening
the
voice
of
mimic
and
gesture
a
theory
of
music
on
the
combinations
and
fusions
of
tones
and
sounds
and
so
on
such
collections
of
precepts
abound
in
all
literatures
and
since
it
soon
becomes
impossible
to
say
what
is
useful
and
what
useless
to
know
books
of
this
sort
become
very
often
a
sort
of
encyclopaedias
or
catalogues
of
desiderata
vitruvius
in
his
treatise
on
architecture
claims
for
the
architect
a
knowledge
of
letters
of
drawing
of
geometry
of
arithmetic
of
optic
of
history
of
natural
and
moral
philosophy
of
jurisprudence
of
medicine
of
astrology
of
music
and
so
on
everything
is
worth
knowing
learn
the
art
and
lay
it
aside
it
should
be
evident
that
such
empirical
collections
are
not
reducible
to
a
science
they
are
composed
of
notions
taken
from
various
sciences
and
teachings
and
their
philosophical
and
scientific
principles
are
to
be
found
in
them
to
undertake
the
construction
of
a
scientific
theory
of
the
different
arts
would
be
to
wish
to
reduce
to
the
single
and
homogeneous
what
is
by
nature
multiple
and
heterogeneous
to
wish
to
destroy
the
existence
as
a
collection
of
what
was
put
together
precisely
to
form
a
collection
were
we
to
give
a
scientific
form
to
the
manuals
of
the
architect
the
painter
or
the
musician
it
is
clear
that
nothing
would
remain
in
our
hands
but
the
general
principles
of
mechanic
optic
or
acoustic
or
if
the
especially
artistic
observations
disseminated
through
it
be
extracted
and
isolated
and
a
science
be
made
of
them
then
the
sphere
of
the
individual
art
is
deserted
and
that
of
aesthetic
entered
upon
for
aesthetic
is
always
general
aesthetic
or
better
it
can
not
be
divided
into
general
and
special
this
last
case
that
is
the
attempt
to
furnish
a
technique
of
aesthetic
is
found
when
men
possessing
strong
scientific
instincts
and
a
natural
tendency
to
philosophy
set
themselves
to
work
to
produce
such
theories
and
technical
manuals
sidenote
of
the
aesthetic
theories
of
the
individual
but
the
confusion
between
physic
and
aesthetic
has
attained
to
its
highest
degree
when
aesthetic
theories
of
the
different
arts
are
imagined
to
answer
such
questions
as
what
are
the
of
each
art
what
can
be
represented
with
colours
and
what
with
sounds
what
with
simple
monochromatic
lines
and
what
with
touches
of
various
colours
what
with
notes
and
what
with
metres
and
rhymes
what
are
the
limits
between
the
figurative
and
the
auditional
arts
between
painting
and
sculpture
poetry
and
music
this
translated
into
scientific
language
is
tantamount
to
asking
what
is
the
connexion
between
acoustic
and
aesthetic
expression
what
between
the
latter
and
optic
and
the
like
now
if
is
no
from
the
physical
fact
to
the
aesthetic
how
could
there
be
from
the
aesthetic
to
particular
groups
of
aesthetic
facts
such
as
the
phenomena
of
optic
or
of
acoustic
sidenote
of
the
classifications
of
the
the
things
called
have
no
aesthetic
limits
because
in
order
to
have
them
they
would
need
to
have
also
aesthetic
existence
and
we
have
demonstrated
the
altogether
empirical
genesis
of
those
divisions
consequently
any
attempt
at
an
aesthetic
classification
of
the
arts
is
absurd
if
they
be
without
limits
they
are
not
exactly
determinable
and
consequently
can
not
be
philosophically
classified
all
the
books
dealing
with
classifications
and
systems
of
the
arts
could
be
burned
without
any
loss
whatever
we
say
this
with
the
utmost
respect
to
the
writers
who
have
expended
their
labours
upon
them
the
impossibility
of
such
classifications
finds
as
it
were
its
proof
in
the
strange
methods
to
which
recourse
has
been
had
to
carry
them
out
the
first
and
most
common
classification
is
that
into
arts
of
and
as
if
eyes
ears
and
imagination
were
on
the
same
level
and
could
be
deduced
from
the
same
logical
variable
as
foundation
of
the
division
others
have
proposed
the
division
into
arts
of
and
and
arts
of
and
as
if
the
concepts
of
space
time
rest
and
motion
could
determine
special
aesthetic
forms
or
have
anything
in
common
with
art
as
such
finally
others
have
amused
themselves
by
dividing
them
into
and
or
into
classic
and
thereby
conferring
the
value
of
scientific
concepts
on
simple
historical
denominations
or
adopting
those
pretended
partitions
of
expressive
forms
already
criticized
above
or
by
talking
of
arts
can
only
be
seen
from
one
like
painting
and
of
arts
can
be
seen
from
all
like
sculpture
and
similar
extravagances
which
exist
neither
in
heaven
nor
on
the
earth
the
theory
of
the
limits
of
the
arts
was
perhaps
at
the
time
when
it
was
put
forward
a
beneficial
critical
reaction
against
those
who
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
flowing
of
one
expression
into
another
as
of
the
or
of
into
a
series
of
paintings
and
thus
held
a
poem
to
be
of
greater
or
lesser
value
according
as
it
could
or
could
not
be
translated
into
pictures
by
a
painter
but
if
the
rebellion
were
reasonable
and
victorious
this
does
not
mean
that
the
arguments
adopted
and
the
theories
made
as
required
were
sound
sidenote
of
the
theory
of
the
union
of
the
another
theory
which
is
a
corollary
to
that
of
the
limits
of
the
arts
falls
with
them
that
of
the
of
the
granted
different
arts
distinct
and
limited
the
questions
were
asked
which
is
the
most
powerful
do
we
not
obtain
more
powerful
effects
by
uniting
several
we
know
nothing
of
this
we
know
only
in
each
individual
case
that
certain
given
artistic
intuitions
have
need
of
definite
physical
means
for
their
reproduction
and
that
other
artistic
intuitions
have
need
of
other
physical
means
we
can
obtain
the
effect
of
certain
dramas
by
simply
reading
them
others
need
declamation
and
scenic
display
some
artistic
intuitions
for
their
full
extrinsication
need
words
song
musical
instruments
colours
statuary
architecture
actors
while
others
are
beautiful
and
complete
in
a
single
delicate
sweep
of
the
pen
or
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pencil
but
it
is
false
to
suppose
that
declamation
and
scenic
effects
and
all
the
other
things
we
have
mentioned
together
are
than
simply
reading
or
than
the
simple
stroke
with
the
pen
and
with
the
pencil
because
each
of
these
facts
or
groups
of
facts
has
so
to
say
a
different
object
and
the
power
of
the
different
means
employed
can
not
be
compared
when
the
objects
are
different
sidenote
of
the
activity
of
externalization
with
utility
and
finally
it
is
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
clear
and
rigorous
distinction
between
the
true
and
proper
aesthetic
activity
and
the
practical
activity
of
externalization
that
we
can
solve
the
involved
and
confused
questions
as
to
the
relations
between
and
and
and
that
art
as
art
is
independent
alike
of
utility
and
of
morality
as
also
of
every
volitional
form
we
have
above
demonstrated
without
this
independence
it
would
not
be
possible
to
speak
of
an
intrinsic
value
of
art
nor
indeed
to
conceive
an
aesthetic
science
which
demands
the
autonomy
of
the
aesthetic
fact
as
a
necessity
of
its
existence
but
it
would
be
erroneous
to
maintain
that
this
independence
of
the
vision
or
intuition
or
internal
expression
of
the
artist
should
be
at
once
extended
to
the
practical
activity
of
externalization
and
of
communication
which
may
or
may
not
follow
the
aesthetic
fact
if
art
be
understood
as
the
externalization
of
art
then
utility
and
morality
have
a
perfect
right
to
deal
with
it
that
is
to
say
the
right
one
possesses
to
deal
with
one
own
household
we
do
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
externalize
and
fix
all
of
the
many
expressions
and
intuitions
which
we
form
in
our
mind
we
do
not
declare
our
every
thought
in
a
loud
voice
or
write
down
or
print
or
draw
or
colour
or
expose
it
to
the
public
gaze
from
the
crowd
of
intuitions
which
are
formed
or
at
least
sketched
within
us
and
the
selection
is
governed
by
selection
of
the
economic
conditions
of
life
and
of
its
moral
direction
therefore
when
we
have
formed
an
intuition
it
remains
to
decide
whether
or
no
we
should
communicate
it
to
others
and
to
whom
and
when
and
how
all
of
which
considerations
fall
equally
under
the
utilitarian
and
ethical
criterion
thus
we
find
the
concepts
of
of
the
of
of
an
of
to
some
extent
justified
although
these
can
in
no
wise
be
justified
as
imposed
upon
art
as
art
and
we
have
ourselves
denounced
them
in
pure
aesthetic
error
always
contains
an
element
of
truth
he
who
formulated
those
erroneous
aesthetic
propositions
had
his
eye
on
practical
facts
which
attach
themselves
externally
to
the
aesthetic
fact
in
economic
and
moral
life
by
all
means
be
partisans
of
a
yet
greater
liberty
in
the
vulgarization
of
the
means
of
aesthetic
reproduction
we
are
of
the
same
opinion
and
let
us
leave
the
proposals
for
legislative
measures
and
for
actions
to
be
instigated
against
immoral
art
to
hypocrites
to
the
ingenuous
and
to
idlers
but
the
proclamation
of
this
liberty
and
the
fixation
of
its
limits
how
wide
soever
they
be
is
always
the
affair
of
morality
and
it
would
in
any
case
be
out
of
place
to
invoke
that
highest
principle
that
which
is
the
independence
of
art
in
order
to
deduce
from
it
the
guiltlessness
of
the
artist
who
in
the
externalization
of
his
imaginings
should
calculate
upon
the
unhealthy
tastes
of
his
readers
or
that
licenses
should
be
granted
to
the
hawkers
who
sell
obscene
statuettes
in
the
streets
this
last
case
is
the
affair
of
the
police
the
first
must
be
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
the
moral
conscience
the
aesthetic
judgment
on
the
work
of
art
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
morality
of
the
artist
in
so
far
as
he
is
a
practical
man
nor
with
the
precautions
to
be
taken
that
art
may
not
be
employed
for
evil
purposes
alien
to
its
essence
which
is
pure
theoretic
contemplation
xvi
taste
and
the
reproduction
of
art
sidenote
judgment
its
identity
with
aesthetic
when
the
entire
aesthetic
and
externalizing
process
has
been
completed
when
a
beautiful
expression
has
been
produced
and
fixed
in
a
definite
physical
material
what
is
meant
by
reproduce
it
in
answer
the
critics
of
art
almost
with
one
voice
very
good
let
us
try
thoroughly
to
understand
this
fact
and
with
that
object
in
view
let
us
represent
it
schematically
the
individual
a
is
seeking
the
expression
of
an
impression
which
he
feels
or
has
a
presentiment
of
but
has
not
yet
expressed
behold
him
trying
various
words
and
phrases
which
may
give
the
expression
which
must
exist
but
which
he
does
not
know
he
tries
the
combination
but
rejects
it
as
unsuitable
inexpressive
incomplete
ugly
he
tries
the
combination
with
a
like
result
does
not
see
anything
or
he
does
not
see
the
expression
still
flies
from
him
after
other
vain
attempts
during
which
he
sometimes
approaches
sometimes
leaves
the
sign
that
offers
itself
all
of
a
sudden
almost
as
though
formed
spontaneously
of
itself
he
creates
the
expression
and
facta
he
enjoys
for
an
instant
aesthetic
pleasure
or
the
pleasure
of
the
beautiful
the
ugly
with
its
correlative
displeasure
was
the
aesthetic
activity
which
had
not
succeeded
in
conquering
the
obstacle
the
beautiful
is
the
expressive
activity
which
now
displays
itself
triumphant
we
have
taken
this
example
from
the
domain
of
speech
as
being
nearer
and
more
accessible
and
because
we
all
talk
though
we
do
not
all
draw
or
paint
now
if
another
individual
whom
we
shall
term
b
desire
to
judge
this
expression
and
decide
whether
it
be
beautiful
or
ugly
he
of
necessity
place
himself
at
a
point
of
and
go
through
the
whole
process
again
with
the
help
of
the
physical
sign
supplied
to
him
by
a
if
a
has
seen
clearly
then
b
who
has
placed
himself
at
point
of
view
will
also
see
clearly
and
will
find
this
expression
beautiful
if
a
has
not
seen
clearly
then
b
also
will
not
see
clearly
and
will
find
the
expression
more
or
less
ugly
as
a
sidenote
of
it
may
be
observed
that
we
have
not
taken
into
consideration
two
other
cases
that
of
a
having
a
clear
and
b
an
obscure
vision
and
that
of
a
having
an
obscure
and
b
a
clear
vision
philosophically
speaking
these
two
cases
are
spiritual
activity
precisely
because
it
is
activity
is
not
a
caprice
but
a
spiritual
necessity
and
it
can
not
solve
a
definite
aesthetic
problem
save
in
one
way
which
is
the
right
way
doubtless
certain
facts
may
be
adduced
which
appear
to
contradict
this
deduction
thus
works
which
seem
beautiful
to
artists
are
judged
to
be
ugly
by
the
critics
while
works
with
which
the
artists
were
displeased
and
judged
imperfect
or
failures
are
held
to
be
beautiful
and
perfect
by
the
critics
but
this
does
not
mean
anything
save
that
one
of
the
two
is
wrong
either
the
critics
or
the
artists
or
in
one
case
the
artist
and
in
another
the
critic
in
fact
the
producer
of
an
expression
does
not
always
fully
realize
what
has
happened
in
his
soul
haste
vanity
want
of
reflexion
theoretic
prejudices
make
people
say
and
sometimes
others
almost
believe
that
works
of
ours
are
beautiful
which
if
we
were
truly
to
turn
inwards
upon
ourselves
we
should
see
ugly
as
they
really
are
thus
poor
don
quixote
when
he
had
mended
his
helmet
as
well
as
he
could
with
cardboard
the
helmet
that
had
showed
itself
to
possess
but
the
feeblest
force
of
resistance
at
the
first
encounter
took
good
care
not
to
test
it
again
with
a
but
simply
declared
and
maintained
it
to
be
says
the
author
celada
finisima
de
and
in
other
cases
the
same
reasons
or
opposite
but
analogous
ones
trouble
the
consciousness
of
the
artist
and
cause
him
to
disapprove
of
what
he
has
successfully
produced
or
to
strive
to
undo
and
do
again
worse
what
he
has
done
well
in
his
artistic
spontaneity
an
example
of
this
is
the
in
the
same
way
haste
laziness
want
of
reflexion
theoretic
prejudices
personal
sympathies
or
animosities
and
other
motives
of
a
similar
sort
sometimes
cause
the
critics
to
proclaim
beautiful
what
is
ugly
and
ugly
what
is
beautiful
were
they
to
eliminate
such
disturbing
elements
they
would
feel
the
work
of
art
as
it
really
is
and
would
not
leave
to
posterity
that
more
diligent
and
more
dispassionate
judge
to
award
the
palm
or
to
do
that
justice
which
they
have
refused
sidenote
of
taste
and
it
is
clear
from
the
preceding
theorem
that
the
judicial
activity
which
criticizes
and
recognizes
the
beautiful
is
identical
with
that
which
produces
it
the
only
difference
lies
in
the
diversity
of
circumstances
since
in
the
one
case
it
is
a
question
of
aesthetic
production
in
the
other
of
reproduction
the
judicial
activity
is
called
the
productive
activity
is
called
genius
and
taste
are
therefore
substantially
the
common
remark
that
the
critic
should
possess
some
of
the
genius
of
the
artist
and
that
the
artist
should
possess
taste
reveals
a
glimpse
of
this
identity
or
that
there
exists
an
active
productive
taste
and
a
passive
reproductive
taste
but
a
denial
of
this
is
contained
in
other
equally
common
remarks
as
when
people
speak
of
taste
without
genius
or
of
genius
without
taste
these
last
observations
are
meaningless
unless
they
be
taken
as
alluding
to
quantitative
differences
in
this
case
those
would
be
called
geniuses
without
taste
who
produce
works
of
art
inspired
in
their
culminating
parts
and
neglected
and
defective
in
their
secondary
parts
and
those
men
of
taste
without
genius
who
succeed
in
obtaining
certain
isolated
or
secondary
effects
but
do
not
possess
the
power
necessary
for
a
vast
artistic
synthesis
analogous
explanations
can
easily
be
given
of
other
similar
propositions
but
to
posit
a
substantial
difference
between
genius
and
taste
between
artistic
production
and
reproduction
would
render
communication
and
judgment
alike
inconceivable
how
could
we
judge
what
remained
extraneous
to
us
how
could
that
which
is
produced
by
a
given
activity
be
judged
by
a
different
activity
the
critic
will
be
a
small
genius
the
artist
a
great
genius
the
one
will
have
the
strength
of
ten
the
other
of
a
hundred
the
former
in
order
to
raise
himself
to
the
altitude
of
the
latter
will
have
need
of
his
assistance
but
the
nature
of
both
must
be
the
same
in
order
to
judge
dante
we
must
raise
ourselves
to
his
level
let
it
be
well
understood
that
empirically
we
are
not
dante
nor
dante
we
but
in
that
moment
of
judgment
and
contemplation
our
spirit
is
one
with
that
of
the
poet
and
in
that
moment
we
and
he
are
one
single
thing
in
this
identity
alone
resides
the
possibility
that
our
little
souls
can
unite
with
the
great
souls
and
become
great
with
them
in
the
universality
of
the
spirit
sidenote
with
the
other
let
us
remark
in
passing
that
what
has
been
said
of
the
aesthetic
holds
good
equally
for
every
other
activity
and
for
every
other
judgment
and
that
scientific
economic
and
ethical
criticism
is
effected
in
a
like
manner
to
limit
ourselves
to
this
last
it
is
only
if
we
place
ourselves
ideally
in
the
same
conditions
in
which
he
who
took
a
given
resolution
found
himself
that
we
can
form
a
judgment
as
to
whether
his
resolution
were
moral
or
immoral
an
action
would
otherwise
remain
incomprehensible
and
therefore
impossible
to
judge
a
homicide
may
be
a
rascal
or
a
hero
if
this
be
within
limits
indifferent
as
regards
the
safety
of
society
which
condemns
both
to
the
same
punishment
it
is
not
indifferent
to
him
who
wishes
to
distinguish
and
to
judge
from
the
moral
point
of
view
and
we
can
not
dispense
with
studying
again
the
individual
psychology
of
the
homicide
in
order
to
determine
the
true
nature
of
his
deed
not
merely
in
its
judicial
but
also
in
its
moral
aspect
in
ethic
a
moral
taste
or
tact
is
sometimes
referred
to
which
answers
to
what
is
generally
called
moral
conscience
that
is
to
say
to
the
activity
itself
of
sidenote
of
absolutism
intellectualism
and
of
aesthetic
the
explanation
above
given
of
aesthetic
judgment
or
reproduction
at
once
affirms
and
denies
the
position
of
the
absolutists
and
relativists
of
those
that
is
to
say
who
affirm
and
of
those
who
deny
the
existence
of
an
absolute
taste
the
absolutists
who
affirm
that
they
can
judge
of
the
beautiful
are
right
but
the
theory
on
which
they
found
their
affirmation
is
not
maintainable
they
conceive
of
the
beautiful
that
is
of
aesthetic
value
as
of
something
placed
outside
the
aesthetic
activity
as
if
it
were
a
model
or
a
concept
which
an
artist
realizes
in
his
work
and
of
which
the
critic
avails
himself
afterwards
in
order
to
judge
the
work
itself
concepts
and
models
alike
have
no
existence
in
art
for
by
proclaiming
that
every
art
can
be
judged
only
in
itself
and
has
its
own
model
in
itself
they
have
attained
to
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
objective
models
of
beauty
whether
they
be
intellectual
concepts
or
ideas
suspended
in
the
metaphysical
sky
in
proclaiming
this
the
adversaries
the
relativists
are
perfectly
right
and
accomplish
a
progress
however
the
initial
rationality
of
their
thesis
becomes
in
its
turn
a
false
theory
repeating
the
old
adage
that
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
they
believe
that
aesthetic
expression
is
of
the
same
nature
as
the
pleasant
and
the
unpleasant
which
every
one
feels
in
his
own
way
and
as
to
which
there
is
no
disputing
but
we
know
that
the
pleasant
and
the
unpleasant
are
utilitarian
and
practical
facts
thus
the
relativists
deny
the
peculiarity
of
the
aesthetic
fact
again
confounding
expression
with
impression
the
theoretic
with
the
practical
the
true
solution
lies
in
rejecting
alike
relativism
or
psychologism
and
false
absolutism
and
in
recognizing
that
the
criterion
of
taste
is
absolute
but
absolute
in
a
different
way
from
that
of
the
intellect
which
is
developed
by
reason
the
criterion
of
taste
is
absolute
with
the
intuitive
absoluteness
of
the
imagination
thus
every
act
of
expressive
activity
which
is
so
really
will
be
recognized
as
beautiful
and
every
fact
in
which
expressive
activity
and
passivity
are
found
engaged
with
one
another
in
an
unfinished
struggle
will
be
recognized
as
ugly
sidenote
of
relative
there
lies
between
absolutists
and
relativists
a
third
class
which
may
be
called
that
of
the
relative
relativists
these
affirm
the
existence
of
absolute
values
in
other
fields
such
as
logic
and
ethic
but
deny
their
existence
in
the
field
of
aesthetic
to
them
it
appears
natural
and
justifiable
to
dispute
about
science
and
morality
because
science
rests
on
the
universal
common
to
all
men
and
morality
on
duty
which
is
also
a
law
of
human
nature
but
how
they
say
can
one
dispute
about
art
which
rests
on
imagination
not
only
however
is
the
imaginative
activity
universal
and
belongs
to
human
nature
like
the
logical
concept
and
practical
duty
but
we
must
oppose
a
capital
objection
to
this
intermediary
thesis
if
the
absolute
nature
of
the
imagination
were
denied
we
should
be
obliged
to
deny
also
that
of
intellectual
or
conceptual
truth
and
implicitly
of
morality
does
not
morality
presuppose
logical
distinctions
how
could
these
be
known
otherwise
than
by
expressions
and
words
that
is
to
say
in
imaginative
form
if
the
absoluteness
of
the
imagination
were
removed
spiritual
life
would
tremble
to
its
base
one
individual
would
no
longer
understand
another
nor
indeed
his
own
self
of
a
moment
before
which
when
considered
a
moment
after
is
already
another
individual
sidenote
founded
on
the
variation
of
the
stimulus
and
on
the
psychic
nevertheless
variety
of
judgments
is
an
indisputable
fact
men
are
at
variance
in
their
logical
ethical
and
economical
appreciations
and
they
are
equally
or
even
more
at
variance
in
their
aesthetic
appreciations
if
certain
reasons
detailed
by
us
above
such
as
haste
prejudices
passions
may
be
held
to
lessen
the
importance
of
this
disagreement
they
do
not
thereby
annul
it
we
have
been
cautious
when
speaking
of
the
stimuli
of
reproduction
for
we
said
that
reproduction
takes
place
all
the
other
conditions
remain
do
they
remain
equal
does
the
hypothesis
correspond
to
reality
it
would
appear
not
in
order
to
reproduce
several
times
an
impression
by
employing
a
suitable
physical
stimulus
it
is
necessary
that
this
stimulus
be
not
changed
and
that
the
organism
remain
in
the
same
psychical
conditions
as
those
in
which
was
experienced
the
impression
that
it
is
desired
to
reproduce
now
it
is
a
fact
that
the
physical
stimulus
is
continually
changing
and
in
like
manner
the
psychological
conditions
oil
paintings
grow
dark
frescoes
pale
statues
lose
noses
hands
and
legs
architecture
becomes
totally
or
partially
a
ruin
the
tradition
of
the
execution
of
a
piece
of
music
is
lost
the
text
of
a
poem
is
corrupted
by
bad
copyists
or
bad
printing
these
are
obvious
instances
of
the
changes
which
daily
occur
in
objects
or
physical
stimuli
as
regards
psychological
conditions
we
will
not
dwell
upon
the
cases
of
deafness
or
blindness
that
is
to
say
upon
the
loss
of
entire
orders
of
psychical
impressions
these
cases
are
secondary
and
of
less
importance
compared
with
the
fundamental
daily
inevitable
and
perpetual
changes
of
the
society
around
us
and
of
the
internal
conditions
of
our
individual
life
the
phonic
manifestations
that
is
the
words
and
verses
of
the
dantesque
must
produce
a
very
different
impression
on
a
citizen
engaged
in
the
politics
of
the
third
rome
to
that
experienced
by
a
and
intimate
contemporary
of
the
poet
the
madonna
of
cimabue
is
still
in
the
church
of
santa
maria
novella
but
does
she
speak
to
the
visitor
of
as
she
spoke
to
the
florentines
of
the
thirteenth
century
even
though
she
were
not
also
darkened
by
time
would
not
the
impression
be
altogether
different
and
finally
how
can
a
poem
composed
in
youth
make
the
same
impression
on
the
same
individual
poet
when
he
it
in
his
old
age
with
his
psychic
dispositions
altogether
changed
sidenote
of
the
division
of
signs
into
natural
and
it
is
true
that
certain
aestheticians
have
attempted
a
distinction
between
stimuli
and
stimuli
between
and
signs
they
would
grant
to
the
former
a
constant
effect
on
all
to
the
latter
only
on
a
limited
circle
in
their
belief
signs
employed
in
painting
are
natural
while
the
words
of
poetry
are
conventional
but
the
difference
between
the
one
and
the
other
is
only
of
degree
it
has
often
been
affirmed
that
painting
is
a
language
which
all
understand
while
with
poetry
it
is
otherwise
here
for
example
leonardo
placed
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
his
art
which
hath
not
need
of
interpreters
of
different
languages
as
have
letters
and
in
it
man
and
brute
find
satisfaction
he
relates
the
anecdote
of
that
portrait
of
the
father
of
a
family
which
the
little
grandchildren
were
wont
to
caress
while
they
were
still
in
and
the
dogs
and
cats
of
the
house
in
like
manner
but
other
anecdotes
such
as
those
of
the
savages
who
took
the
portrait
of
a
soldier
for
a
boat
or
considered
the
portrait
of
a
man
on
horseback
as
furnished
with
only
one
leg
are
apt
to
shake
faith
in
the
understanding
of
painting
by
sucklings
dogs
and
cats
fortunately
no
arduous
researches
are
necessary
to
convince
oneself
that
pictures
poetry
and
every
work
of
art
produce
no
effects
save
on
souls
prepared
to
receive
them
natural
signs
do
not
exist
because
they
are
all
conventional
in
a
like
manner
or
to
speak
with
greater
exactitude
all
are
sidenote
surmounting
of
this
being
so
how
are
we
to
succeed
in
causing
the
expression
to
be
reproduced
by
means
of
the
physical
object
how
obtain
the
same
effect
when
the
conditions
are
no
longer
the
same
would
it
not
rather
seem
necessary
to
conclude
that
expressions
can
not
be
reproduced
despite
the
physical
instruments
made
by
man
for
the
purpose
and
that
what
is
called
reproduction
consists
in
ever
new
expressions
such
would
indeed
be
the
conclusion
if
the
variety
of
physical
and
psychic
conditions
were
intrinsically
unsurmountable
but
since
the
insuperability
has
none
of
the
characteristics
of
necessity
we
must
on
the
contrary
conclude
that
the
reproduction
always
occurs
when
we
can
replace
ourselves
in
the
conditions
in
which
the
stimulus
physical
beauty
was
produced
not
only
can
we
replace
ourselves
in
these
conditions
as
an
abstract
possibility
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
so
continually
individual
life
which
is
communion
with
ourselves
with
our
past
and
social
life
which
is
communion
with
our
like
would
not
otherwise
be
possible
sidenote
and
historical
as
regards
the
physical
object
paleographers
and
philologists
who
to
texts
their
original
physiognomy
of
pictures
and
of
statues
and
similar
categories
of
workers
exert
themselves
to
preserve
or
to
give
back
to
the
physical
object
all
its
primitive
energy
these
efforts
certainly
do
not
always
succeed
or
are
not
completely
successful
for
never
or
hardly
ever
is
it
possible
to
obtain
a
restoration
complete
in
its
smallest
details
but
the
unsurmountable
is
only
accidentally
present
and
can
not
cause
us
to
fail
to
recognize
the
favourable
results
which
are
nevertheless
obtained
likewise
labours
to
reintegrate
in
us
historical
conditions
which
have
been
altered
in
the
course
of
history
it
revives
the
dead
completes
the
fragmentary
and
affords
us
the
opportunity
of
seeing
a
work
of
art
a
physical
object
as
its
author
saw
it
at
the
moment
of
production
a
condition
of
this
historical
labour
is
tradition
with
the
help
of
which
it
is
possible
to
collect
the
scattered
rays
and
cause
them
to
converge
on
one
centre
with
the
help
of
memory
we
surround
the
physical
stimulus
with
all
the
facts
among
which
it
arose
and
thus
we
make
it
possible
for
it
to
react
upon
us
as
it
acted
upon
him
who
produced
it
when
the
tradition
is
broken
interpretation
is
arrested
in
this
case
the
products
of
the
past
remain
for
us
thus
the
expressions
contained
in
the
etruscan
or
messapian
inscriptions
are
unattainable
thus
we
still
hear
discussions
among
ethnographers
as
to
certain
products
of
the
art
of
savages
whether
they
be
pictures
or
writings
thus
archaeologists
and
prehistorians
are
not
always
able
to
establish
with
certainty
whether
the
figures
found
on
the
ceramic
of
a
certain
region
and
on
other
instruments
employed
be
of
a
religious
or
of
a
profane
nature
but
the
arrest
of
interpretation
as
that
of
restoration
is
never
a
definitely
unsurmountable
barrier
and
the
daily
discoveries
of
historical
sources
and
of
new
methods
of
better
exploiting
antiquity
which
we
may
hope
to
see
ever
improving
link
up
broken
tradition
we
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
erroneous
historical
interpretation
produces
at
times
what
we
may
term
new
expressions
imposed
upon
the
antique
artistic
imaginings
instead
of
historical
reproductions
the
fascination
of
the
past
depends
in
part
upon
these
expressions
of
ours
which
we
weave
into
historical
expressions
thus
in
hellenic
plastic
art
has
been
discovered
the
calm
and
serene
intuition
of
life
of
those
peoples
who
feel
nevertheless
so
poignantly
the
universality
of
sorrow
thus
has
recently
been
discerned
on
the
faces
of
the
byzantine
saints
the
terror
of
the
millennium
a
terror
which
is
an
equivoke
or
an
artificial
legend
invented
by
modern
scholars
but
tends
precisely
to
circumscribe
and
to
establish
with
exactitude
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
must
look
thus
we
live
in
communication
with
other
men
of
the
present
and
of
the
past
and
we
must
not
conclude
because
sometimes
and
indeed
often
we
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
the
unknown
or
the
badly
known
that
when
we
believe
we
are
engaged
in
a
dialogue
we
are
always
speaking
a
monologue
nor
that
we
are
unable
even
to
repeat
the
monologue
which
in
the
past
we
held
with
ourselves

sometimes
the
depreciatory
or
negative
judgment
refers
to
the
presumed
or
proved
uselessness
of
many
researches
made
to
recover
the
correct
meaning
of
artistic
works
but
it
must
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
historical
research
does
not
only
fulfil
the
task
of
helping
to
reproduce
and
judge
artistic
works
the
biography
of
a
writer
or
of
an
artist
for
example
and
the
study
of
the
costume
of
a
period
also
possess
their
own
interest
foreign
to
the
history
of
art
but
not
foreign
to
other
forms
of
history
if
allusion
be
made
to
those
researches
which
do
not
appear
to
have
interest
of
any
kind
nor
to
fulfil
any
purpose
it
must
be
replied
that
the
historical
student
must
often
reconcile
himself
to
the
useful
but
little
glorious
office
of
a
cataloguer
of
facts
these
facts
remain
for
the
time
being
formless
incoherent
and
insignificant
but
they
are
preserves
or
mines
for
the
historian
of
the
future
and
for
whomsoever
may
afterwards
want
them
for
any
purpose
in
the
same
way
books
which
nobody
asks
for
are
placed
on
the
shelves
and
are
noted
in
the
catalogues
because
they
may
be
asked
for
at
some
time
or
other
certainly
in
the
same
way
that
an
intelligent
librarian
gives
the
preference
to
the
acquisition
and
to
the
cataloguing
of
those
books
which
he
foresees
may
be
of
more
or
better
service
so
do
intelligent
students
possess
the
instinct
as
to
what
is
or
may
more
probably
be
useful
from
among
the
mass
of
facts
which
they
are
investigating
others
on
the
other
hand
less
less
intelligent
or
more
hasty
in
producing
accumulate
useless
selections
rejections
and
erasures
and
lose
themselves
in
refinements
and
gossipy
discussions
but
this
appertains
to
the
economy
of
research
and
is
not
our
affair
at
the
most
it
is
the
affair
of
the
master
who
selects
the
subjects
of
the
publisher
who
pays
for
the
printing
and
of
the
critic
who
is
called
upon
to
praise
or
to
blame
the
students
for
their
researches
on
the
other
hand
it
is
evident
that
historical
research
directed
to
illuminate
a
work
of
art
by
placing
us
in
a
position
to
judge
it
does
not
alone
suffice
to
bring
it
to
birth
in
our
spirit
taste
and
an
imagination
trained
and
awakened
are
likewise
presupposed
the
greatest
historical
erudition
may
accompany
a
taste
in
part
gross
or
defective
a
lumbering
imagination
or
as
it
is
generally
phrased
a
cold
hard
heart
closed
to
art
which
is
the
lesser
evil
great
erudition
and
defective
taste
or
natural
good
taste
and
great
ignorance
the
question
has
often
been
asked
and
perhaps
it
will
be
best
to
deny
its
possibility
because
one
can
not
tell
which
of
two
evils
is
the
less
or
what
exactly
that
means
the
merely
learned
man
never
succeeds
in
entering
into
communication
with
the
great
spirits
and
keeps
wandering
for
ever
about
the
outer
courts
the
staircases
and
the
antechambers
of
their
palaces
but
the
gifted
ignoramus
either
passes
by
masterpieces
which
are
to
him
inaccessible
or
instead
of
understanding
the
works
of
art
as
they
really
are
he
invents
others
with
his
imagination
now
the
labour
of
the
former
may
at
least
serve
to
enlighten
others
but
the
ingenuity
of
the
latter
remains
altogether
sterile
how
then
can
we
fail
to
prefer
the
conscientious
learned
man
to
the
inconclusive
man
of
talent
who
is
not
really
talented
if
he
resign
himself
and
in
so
far
as
he
resigns
himself
to
come
to
no
conclusion
sidenote
and
artistic
history
its
distinction
from
historical
criticism
and
from
artistic
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
accurately
history
of
art
and
from
those
historical
labours
which
make
use
of
works
of
art
but
for
extraneous
purposes
such
as
biography
civil
religious
and
political
history
etc
and
also
from
historical
erudition
whose
object
is
preparation
for
the
aesthetic
synthesis
of
reproduction
the
difference
between
the
first
of
these
is
obvious
the
history
of

and

has
the
works

themselves
for
principal
subject

of
art
but
only
as
witnesses
from
which
to
discover
the
truth
of
facts
which
are
not
aesthetic
the
second
difference
to
which
we
have
referred
may
seem
less
profound
however
it
is
very
great
erudition
devoted
to
rendering
clear
again
the
understanding
of
works
of
art
aims
simply
at
making
appear
a
certain
internal
fact
an
aesthetic
reproduction
artistic
and
literary
history
on
the
other
hand
does
not
appear
until
such
reproduction
has
been
obtained
it
demands
therefore
further
labour
like
all
other
history
its
object
is
to
record
precisely
such
facts
as
have
really
taken
place
that
is
artistic
and
literary
facts
a
man
who
after
having
acquired
the
requisite
historical
erudition
reproduces
in
himself
and
tastes
a
work
of
art
may
remain
simply
a
man
of
taste
or
express
at
the
most
his
own
feeling
with
an
exclamation
of
beautiful
or
ugly
this
does
not
suffice
for
the
making
of
a
historian
of
literature
and
art
there
is
further
need
that
the
simple
act
of
reproduction
be
followed
in
him
by
a
second
internal
operation
what
is
this
new
operation
it
is
in
its
turn
an
expression
the
expression
of
the
reproduction
the
historical
description
exposition
or
representation
there
is
this
difference
then
between
the
man
of
taste
and
the
historian
the
first
merely
reproduces
in
his
spirit
the
work
of
art
the
second
after
having
reproduced
it
represents
it
historically
thus
applying
to
it
those
categories
by
which
as
we
know
history
is
differentiated
from
pure
art
artistic
and
literary
history
is
therefore
historical
work
of
art
founded
upon
one
or
more
works
of
the
denomination
of
artistic
or
literary
critic
is
used
in
various
senses
sometimes
it
is
applied
to
the
student
who
devotes
his
services
to
literature
sometimes
to
the
historian
who
reveals
the
works
of
art
of
the
past
in
their
reality
more
often
to
both
by
critic
is
sometimes
understood
in
a
more
restricted
sense
he
who
judges
and
describes
contemporary
literary
works
and
by
historian
he
who
is
occupied
with
less
recent
works
these
are
but
linguistic
usages
and
empirical
distinctions
which
may
be
neglected
because
the
true
difference
lies
the
learned
man
the
man
of
taste
and
the
historian
of
these
words
designate
as
it
were
three
successive
stages
of
work
of
which
each
is
relatively
independent
of
the
one
that
follows
but
not
of
that
which
precedes
as
we
have
seen
a
man
may
be
simply
learned
yet
possess
little
capacity
for
understanding
works
of
art
he
may
indeed
be
both
learned
and
possess
taste
yet
be
unable
to
write
a
page
of
artistic
and
literary
history
but
the
true
and
complete
historian
while
containing
in
himself
as
necessary
both
the
learned
man
and
the
man
of
taste
must
add
to
their
qualities
the
gift
of
historical
comprehension
and
representation
sidenote
method
of
artistic
and
literary
the
method
of
artistic
and
literary
history
presents
problems
and
difficulties
some
common
to
all
historical
method
others
peculiar
to
it
because
they
derive
from
the
concept
of
art
itself
sidenote
of
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
history
is
wont
to
be
divided
into
the
history
of
man
the
history
or
nature
and
the
mixed
history
of
both
the
preceding
without
examining
here
the
question
of
the
solidity
of
this
division
it
is
clear
that
artistic
and
literary
history
belongs
in
any
case
to
the
first
since
it
concerns
a
spiritual
activity
that
is
to
say
an
activity
proper
to
man
and
since
this
activity
is
its
subject
the
absurdity
of
propounding
the
historical
of
the
origin
of
becomes
at
once
evident
we
should
note
that
by
this
formula
many
different
things
have
in
turn
been
included
on
many
different
occasions
has
often
meant
or
of
the
artistic
fact
and
here
was
a
real
scientific
or
philosophic
problem
the
very
problem
in
fact
which
our
treatise
has
tried
to
solve
at
other
times
by
origin
has
been
understood
the
ideal
genesis
the
search
for
the
reason
of
art
the
deduction
of
the
artistic
fact
from
a
first
principle
containing
in
itself
both
spirit
and
nature
this
is
also
a
philosophical
problem
and
it
is
complementary
to
the
preceding
indeed
it
coincides
with
it
though
it
has
sometimes
been
strangely
interpreted
and
solved
by
means
of
an
arbitrary
and
metaphysic
but
when
it
has
been
sought
to
discover
further
exactly
in
what
way
the
artistic
function
was
this
has
resulted
in
the
absurdity
to
which
we
have
referred
if
expression
be
the
first
form
of
consciousness
how
can
the
historical
origin
be
sought
of
what
is
not
to
be
a
product
of
nature
and
of
human
history
how
can
we
find
the
historical
genesis
of
that
which
is
a
category
by
means
of
which
every
historical
genesis
and
fact
are
understood
the
absurdity
has
arisen
from
the
comparison
with
human
institutions
which
have
in
fact
been
formed
in
the
course
of
history
and
which
have
disappeared
or
may
disappear
in
its
course
there
exists
between
the
aesthetic
fact
and
a
human
institution
such
as
monogamic
marriage
or
the
fief
a
difference
to
some
extent
comparable
with
that
between
simple
and
compound
bodies
in
chemistry
it
is
impossible
to
indicate
the
formation
of
the
former
otherwise
they
would
not
be
simple
and
if
this
be
discovered
they
cease
to
be
simple
and
become
compound
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
art
historically
understood
is
only
justified
when
it
is
proposed
to
seek
not
for
the
formation
of
the
function
but
where
and
when
art
has
appeared
for
the
first
time
appeared
that
is
to
say
in
a
striking
manner
at
what
point
or
in
what
region
of
the
globe
and
at
what
point
or
epoch
of
its
history
when
that
is
to
say
not
the
origin
of
art
but
its
most
antique
or
primitive
history
is
the
object
of
research
this
problem
forms
one
with
that
of
the
appearance
of
human
civilization
on
the
earth
data
for
its
solution
are
certainly
wanting
but
there
yet
remains
the
abstract
possibility
and
certainly
attempts
and
hypotheses
for
its
solution
abound
sidenote
and
the
criterion
of
every
form
of
human
history
has
the
concept
of
for
foundation
but
by
progress
must
not
be
understood
the
imaginary
and
metaphysical
of
which
should
lead
the
generations
of
man
with
irresistible
force
to
some
unknown
destiny
according
to
a
providential
plan
which
we
can
logically
divine
and
understand
a
supposed
law
of
this
sort
is
the
negation
of
history
itself
of
that
accidentality
that
empiricity
that
contingency
which
distinguish
the
concrete
fact
from
the
abstraction
and
for
the
same
reason
progress
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
of
if
evolution
mean
the
concrete
fact
of
reality
which
evolves
that
is
which
is
reality
it
is
not
a
law
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
a
law
it
becomes
confounded
with
the
law
of
progress
in
the
sense
just
described
the
progress
of
which
we
speak
here
is
nothing
but
the
of
human
activity
which
working
upon
the
material
supplied
to
it
by
nature
conquers
obstacles
and
bends
nature
to
its
own
ends
such
conception
of
progress
that
is
to
say
of
human
activity
applied
to
a
given
material
is
the
of
of
the
historian
of
humanity
no
one
but
a
mere
collector
of
stray
facts
a
simple
seeker
or
an
incoherent
chronicler
can
put
together
the
smallest
narrative
of
human
deeds
unless
he
have
a
definite
point
of
view
that
is
to
say
an
intimate
personal
conviction
regarding
the
conception
of
the
facts
which
he
has
undertaken
to
relate
the
historical
work
of
art
can
not
be
achieved
among
the
confused
and
discordant
mass
of
crude
facts
save
by
means
of
this
point
of
view
which
makes
it
possible
to
carve
a
definite
figure
from
that
rough
and
incoherent
mass
the
historian
of
a
practical
action
should
know
what
is
economy
and
what
morality
the
historian
of
mathematics
what
are
mathematics
the
historian
of
botany
what
is
botany
the
historian
of
philosophy
what
is
philosophy
but
if
he
do
not
really
know
these
things
he
must
at
least
have
the
illusion
of
knowing
them
otherwise
he
will
never
be
able
to
delude
himself
that
he
is
writing
history
we
can
not
delay
here
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
and
the
inevitability
of
this
subjective
criterion
in
every
narrative
of
human
affairs
we
will
merely
say
that
this
criterion
is
compatible
with
the
utmost
objectivity
impartiality
and
scrupulosity
in
dealing
with
data
and
indeed
forms
a
constitutive
element
of
such
subjective
criterion
it
suffices
to
read
any
book
of
history
to
discover
at
once
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
if
he
be
a
historian
worthy
of
the
name
and
know
his
own
business
there
exist
liberal
and
reactionary
rationalist
and
catholic
historians
who
deal
with
political
or
social
history
for
the
history
of
philosophy
there
are
metaphysical
empirical
sceptical
idealist
and
spiritualist
historians
absolutely
historical
historians
do
not
and
can
not
exist
can
it
be
said
that
thucydides
and
polybius
livy
and
tacitus
machiavelli
and
guicciardini
giannone
and
voltaire
were
without
moral
and
political
views
and
in
our
time
guizot
or
thiers
macaulay
or
balbo
ranke
or
mommsen
and
in
the
history
of
philosophy
from
hegel
who
was
the
first
to
raise
it
to
a
great
elevation
to
ritter
zeller
cousin
lewes
and
our
spaventa
was
there
one
who
did
not
possess
his
conception
of
progress
and
criterion
of
judgment
is
there
one
single
work
of
any
value
in
the
history
of
aesthetic
which
has
not
been
written
from
this
or
that
point
of
view
with
this
or
that
bias
hegelian
or
herbartian
from
a
sensualist
or
from
an
eclectic
point
of
view
and
so
on
if
the
historian
is
to
escape
from
the
inevitable
necessity
of
taking
a
side
he
must
become
a
political
and
scientific
eunuch
and
history
is
not
the
business
of
eunuchs
they
would
at
most
be
of
use
in
compiling
those
great
tomes
of
not
useless
erudition
atque
which
are
called
not
without
reason
monkish
if
then
the
concept
of
progress
the
point
of
view
the
criterion
be
inevitable
the
best
to
be
done
is
not
to
try
and
escape
from
them
but
to
obtain
the
best
possible
everyone
strives
for
this
end
when
he
forms
his
own
convictions
seriously
and
laboriously
historians
who
profess
to
wish
to
interrogate
the
facts
without
adding
anything
of
their
own
to
them
are
not
to
be
believed
this
at
the
most
is
the
result
of
ingenuousness
and
illusion
on
their
part
they
will
always
add
what
they
have
of
personal
if
they
be
truly
historians
though
it
be
without
knowing
it
or
they
will
believe
that
they
have
escaped
doing
so
only
because
they
have
referred
to
it
by
innuendo
which
is
the
most
insinuating
and
penetrative
of
methods
sidenote
of
a
unique
line
of
progress
in
artistic
and
literary
artistic
and
literary
history
can
not
dispense
with
the
criterion
of
progress
any
more
easily
than
other
history
we
can
not
show
what
a
given
work
of
art
is
save
by
proceeding
from
a
conception
of
art
in
order
to
fix
the
artistic
problem
which
the
author
of
such
work
of
art
had
to
solve
and
by
determining
whether
or
no
he
have
solved
it
or
by
how
much
and
in
what
way
he
has
failed
to
do
so
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
criterion
of
progress
assumes
a
different
form
in
artistic
and
literary
history
to
that
which
it
assumes
or
is
believed
to
assume
in
the
history
of
science
the
whole
history
of
knowledge
can
be
represented
by
one
single
line
of
progress
and
regress
science
is
the
universal
and
its
problems
are
arranged
in
one
single
vast
system
or
complex
problem
all
thinkers
weary
themselves
over
the
same
problem
as
to
the
nature
of
reality
and
of
knowledge
contemplative
indians
and
greek
philosophers
christians
and
mohammedans
bare
heads
and
heads
with
turbans
wigged
heads
and
heads
with
the
black
berretta
as
heine
said
and
future
generations
will
weary
themselves
with
it
as
ours
has
done
it
would
take
too
long
to
inquire
here
if
this
be
true
or
not
of
science
but
it
is
certainly
not
true
of
art
art
is
intuition
and
intuition
is
individuality
and
individuality
is
never
repeated
to
conceive
of
the
history
of
the
artistic
production
of
the
human
race
as
developed
along
a
single
line
of
progress
and
regress
would
therefore
be
altogether
erroneous
at
the
most
and
working
to
some
extent
with
generalizations
and
abstractions
it
may
be
admitted
that
the
history
of
aesthetic
products
shows
progressive
cycles
but
each
cycle
has
its
own
problem
and
is
progressive
only
in
respect
to
that
problem
when
many
are
at
work
on
the
same
subject
without
succeeding
in
giving
to
it
the
suitable
form
yet
drawing
always
more
nearly
to
it
there
is
said
to
be
progress
when
he
who
gives
to
it
definite
form
appears
the
cycle
is
said
to
be
complete
progress
ended
a
typical
example
of
this
would
be
the
progress
in
the
elaboration
of
the
mode
of
using
the
of
chivalry
during
the
italian
renaissance
from
pulci
to
ariosto
if
this
instance
be
made
use
of
excessive
simplification
of
it
must
be
excused
nothing
but
repetition
and
imitation
could
be
the
result
of
employing
that
same
material
after
ariosto
the
result
was
repetition
or
imitation
diminution
or
exaggeration
a
spoiling
of
what
had
already
been
achieved
in
sum
decadence
the
ariostesque
epigoni
prove
this
progress
begins
with
the
commencement
of
a
new
cycle
cervantes
with
his
more
open
and
conscious
irony
is
an
instance
of
this
in
what
did
the
general
decadence
of
italian
literature
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
consist
simply
in
having
nothing
more
to
say
and
in
repeating
and
exaggerating
motives
already
found
if
the
italians
of
this
period
had
even
been
able
to
express
their
own
decadence
they
would
not
have
been
altogether
failures
but
have
anticipated
the
literary
movement
of
the
renaissance
where
the
is
not
the
same
a
progressive
cycle
does
not
exist
shakespeare
does
not
represent
a
progress
as
regards
dante
nor
goethe
as
regards
shakespeare
dante
however
represents
a
progress
in
respect
to
the
visionaries
of
the
middle
ages
shakespeare
to
the
elizabethan
dramatists
goethe
with
and
the
first
part
of
in
respect
to
the
writers
of
the
und
this
mode
of
presenting
the
history
of
poetry
and
art
contains
however
as
we
have
remarked
something
of
abstract
of
merely
practical
and
is
without
rigorous
philosophical
value
not
only
is
the
art
of
savages
not
inferior
as
art
to
that
of
civilized
peoples
provided
it
be
correlative
to
the
impressions
of
the
savage
but
every
individual
indeed
every
moment
of
the
spiritual
life
of
an
individual
has
its
artistic
world
and
all
those
worlds
are
artistically
incomparable
with
one
another
sidenote
committed
in
respect
to
this
many
have
sinned
and
continue
to
sin
against
this
special
form
of
the
criterion
of
progress
in
artistic
and
literary
history
some
for
instance
talk
of
the
infancy
of
italian
art
in
giotto
and
of
its
maturity
in
raphael
or
in
titian
as
though
giotto
were
not
quite
perfect
and
complete
in
respect
to
his
psychic
material
he
was
certainly
incapable
of
drawing
a
figure
like
raphael
or
of
colouring
it
like
titian
but
was
raphael
or
titian
by
any
chance
capable
of
creating
the
di
san
francesco
con
la
or
the
di
san
the
spirit
of
giotto
had
not
felt
the
attraction
of
the
body
beautiful
which
the
renaissance
studied
and
raised
to
a
place
of
honour
but
the
spirits
of
raphael
and
of
titian
were
no
longer
curious
of
certain
movements
of
ardour
and
of
tenderness
which
attracted
the
man
of
the
fourteenth
century
how
then
can
a
comparison
be
made
where
there
is
no
comparative
term
the
celebrated
divisions
of
the
history
of
art
suffer
from
the
same
defect
they
are
as
follows
an
oriental
period
representing
a
disequilibrium
between
idea
and
form
with
prevalence
of
the
second
a
classical
representing
an
equilibrium
between
idea
and
form
a
romantic
representing
a
new
disequilibrium
between
idea
and
form
with
prevalence
of
the
idea
there
are
also
the
divisions
into
oriental
art
representing
imperfection
of
form
classical
perfection
of
form
romantic
or
modern
perfection
of
content
and
of
form
thus
classic
and
romantic
have
also
received
among
their
many
other
meanings
that
of
progressive
or
regressive
periods
in
respect
to
the
realization
of
some
indefinite
artistic
ideal
of
humanity
sidenote
meanings
of
the
word
progress
in
respect
to
there
is
no
such
thing
then
as
an
progress
of
humanity
however
by
aesthetic
progress
is
sometimes
meant
not
what
the
two
words
coupled
together
really
signify
but
the
accumulation
of
our
historical
knowledge
which
makes
us
able
to
sympathize
with
all
the
artistic
products
of
all
peoples
and
of
all
times
or
as
is
said
to
make
our
taste
more
catholic
the
difference
appears
very
great
if
the
eighteenth
century
so
incapable
of
escaping
from
itself
be
compared
with
our
own
time
which
enjoys
alike
hellenic
and
roman
art
now
better
understood
byzantine
mediaeval
arabic
and
renaissance
art
the
art
of
the
cinque
cento
baroque
art
and
the
art
of
the
seventeenth
century
egyptian
babylonian
etruscan
and
even
prehistoric
art
are
more
profoundly
studied
every
day
certainly
the
difference
between
the
savage
and
civilized
man
does
not
lie
in
the
human
faculties
the
savage
has
speech
intellect
religion
and
morality
in
common
with
civilized
man
and
he
is
a
complete
man
the
only
difference
lies
in
that
civilized
man
penetrates
and
dominates
a
larger
portion
of
the
universe
with
his
theoretic
and
practical
activity
we
can
not
claim
to
be
more
spiritually
alert
than
for
example
the
contemporaries
of
pericles
but
no
one
can
deny
that
we
are
richer
than
they
rich
with
their
riches
and
with
those
of
how
many
other
peoples
and
generations
besides
our
own
by
aesthetic
progress
is
also
meant
in
another
sense
which
is
also
improper
the
greater
abundance
of
artistic
intuitions
and
the
smaller
number
of
imperfect
or
decadent
works
which
one
epoch
produces
in
respect
to
another
thus
it
may
be
said
that
there
was
aesthetic
progress
an
artistic
awakening
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
or
of
the
fifteenth
centuries
finally
aesthetic
progress
is
talked
of
with
an
eye
to
the
refinement
and
to
the
psychical
complications
exhibited
in
the
works
of
art
of
the
most
civilized
peoples
as
compared
with
those
of
less
civilized
peoples
barbarians
and
savages
but
in
this
case
the
progress
is
that
of
the
complex
conditions
of
society
not
of
the
artistic
activity
to
which
the
material
is
indifferent
these
are
the
most
important
points
concerning
the
method
of
artistic
and
literary
history
xviii
conclusion
identity
of
linguistic
and
aesthetic
sidenote
of
the
a
glance
over
the
path
traversed
will
show
that
we
have
completed
the
entire
programme
of
our
treatise
we
have
studied
the
nature
of
intuitive
or
expressive
knowledge
which
is
the
aesthetic
or
artistic
fact
and
ii
and
we
have
described
the
other
form
of
knowledge
namely
the
intellectual
with
the
secondary
complications
of
its
forms
having
done
this
it
became
possible
to
criticize
all
erroneous
theories
of
art
which
arise
from
the
confusion
between
the
various
forms
and
from
the
undue
transference
of
the
characteristics
of
one
form
to
those
of
another
iv
and
in
so
doing
to
indicate
the
inverse
errors
which
are
found
in
the
theory
of
intellectual
knowledge
and
of
historiography
passing
on
to
examine
the
relations
between
the
aesthetic
activity
and
the
other
spiritual
activities
no
longer
theoretic
but
practical
we
have
indicated
the
true
character
of
the
practical
activity
and
the
place
which
it
occupies
in
respect
to
the
theoretic
activity
which
it
follows
hence
the
critique
of
the
invasion
of
aesthetic
theory
by
practical
concepts
we
have
also
distinguished
the
two
forms
of
the
practical
activity
as
economic
and
ethic
vii
adding
to
this
the
statement
that
there
are
no
other
forms
of
the
spirit
beyond
the
four
which
we
have
analyzed
hence
viii
the
critique
of
every
metaphysical
aesthetic
and
seeing
that
there
exist
no
other
spiritual
forms
of
equal
degree
therefore
there
are
no
original
subdivisions
of
the
four
established
and
in
particular
of
aesthetic
from
this
arises
the
impossibility
of
classes
of
expressions
and
the
critique
of
rhetoric
that
is
of
the
partition
of
expressions
into
simple
and
ornate
and
of
their
subclasses
but
by
the
law
of
the
unity
of
the
spirit
the
aesthetic
fact
is
also
a
practical
fact
and
as
such
occasions
pleasure
and
pain
this
led
us
to
study
the
feelings
of
value
in
general
and
those
of
aesthetic
value
or
of
the
beautiful
in
particular
x
to
criticize
aesthetic
hedonism
in
all
its
various
manifestations
and
complications
xi
and
to
expel
from
the
system
of
aesthetic
the
long
series
of
concepts
which
had
been
introduced
into
it
proceeding
from
aesthetic
production
to
the
facts
of
reproduction
we
began
by
investigating
the
mode
of
fixing
externally
the
aesthetic
expression
with
the
view
of
reproduction
this
is
the
physically
beautiful
whether
it
be
natural
or
artificial
we
then
derived
from
this
distinction
the
critique
of
the
errors
which
arise
from
confounding
the
physical
with
the
aesthetic
side
of
things
we
indicated
the
meaning
of
artistic
technique
that
which
is
the
technique
serving
for
reproduction
thus
criticizing
the
divisions
limits
and
classifications
of
the
individual
arts
and
establishing
the
connections
between
art
economy
and
morality
because
the
existence
of
the
physical
objects
does
not
suffice
to
stimulate
to
the
full
aesthetic
reproduction
and
because
in
order
to
obtain
this
result
it
is
necessary
to
recall
the
conditions
in
which
the
stimulus
first
operated
we
have
also
studied
the
function
of
historical
erudition
directed
toward
the
end
of
our
communication
with
the
works
of
the
past
and
toward
the
creation
of
a
base
for
aesthetic
judgment
we
have
closed
our
treatise
by
showing
how
the
reproduction
thus
obtained
is
afterwards
elaborated
by
the
intellectual
categories
that
is
to
say
by
an
excursus
on
the
method
of
literary
and
artistic
history
the
aesthetic
fact
has
thus
been
considered
both
in
itself
and
in
its
relations
with
the
other
spiritual
activities
with
the
feelings
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
with
the
facts
that
are
called
physical
with
memory
and
with
historical
elaboration
it
has
passed
from
the
position
of
to
that
of
that
is
to
say
from
the
moment
of
until
gradually
it
becomes
changed
for
the
spirit
into
our
treatise
may
appear
to
be
somewhat
meagre
when
compared
with
the
great
volumes
usually
consecrated
to
aesthetic
but
it
will
not
seem
so
when
it
is
observed
that
these
volumes
as
regards
of
their
contents
are
full
of
matter
which
does
not
appertain
to
aesthetic
such
as
definitions
either
psychical
or
metaphysical
of
concepts
of
the
sublime
the
comic
the
tragic
the
humorous
etc
or
of
the
exposition
of
the
supposed
zoology
botany
and
mineralogy
of
aesthetic
and
of
universal
history
judged
from
the
aesthetic
standpoint
the
whole
history
of
concrete
art
and
literature
has
also
been
dragged
into
those
aesthetics
and
generally
mangled
they
contain
judgments
upon
homer
and
dante
upon
ariosto
and
shakespeare
upon
beethoven
and
rossini
michelangelo
and
raphael
when
all
this
has
been
deducted
from
them
our
treatise
will
no
longer
be
held
to
be
too
meagre
but
on
the
contrary
far
more
copious
than
ordinary
treatises
for
these
either
omit
altogether
or
hardly
touch
at
all
the
greater
part
of
the
difficult
problems
proper
to
aesthetic
which
we
have
felt
it
to
be
our
duty
to
study
sidenote
of
linguistic
and
aesthetic
then
as
the
science
of
expression
has
been
here
studied
by
us
from
every
point
of
view
but
there
yet
remains
to
justify
the
which
we
have
joined
to
the
title
of
our
book
and
to
state
and
make
clear
the
thesis
that
the
science
of
art
is
that
of
language
aesthetic
and
linguistic
in
so
far
as
they
are
true
sciences
are
not
two
different
sciences
but
one
single
science
not
that
there
is
a
special
linguistic
but
the
linguistic
science
sought
for
general
linguistic
so
far
as
what
it
contains
is
reducible
to
is
nothing
but
aesthetic
whoever
studies
general
linguistic
that
is
to
say
philosophical
linguistic
studies
aesthetic
problems
and
of
language
and
philosophy
of
art
are
the
same
were
linguistic
a
science
from
aesthetic
it
should
not
have
expression
which
is
the
essentially
aesthetic
fact
for
its
object
this
amounts
to
saying
that
it
must
be
denied
that
language
is
expression
but
an
emission
of
sounds
which
expresses
nothing
is
not
language
language
is
articulate
limited
organized
sound
employed
in
expression
if
on
the
other
hand
language
were
a
science
in
respect
to
aesthetic
it
would
necessarily
have
for
its
object
a
of
expressions
but
the
inexistence
of
classes
of
expression
is
a
point
which
we
have
already
demonstrated
sidenote
formulization
of
linguistic
problems
nature
of
the
problems
which
linguistic
serves
to
solve
and
the
errors
with
which
linguistic
strives
and
has
striven
are
the
same
that
occupy
and
complicate
aesthetic
if
it
be
not
always
easy
it
is
on
the
other
hand
always
possible
to
reduce
the
philosophic
questions
of
linguistic
to
their
aesthetic
formula
the
disputes
as
to
the
nature
of
the
one
find
their
parallel
in
those
as
to
the
nature
of
the
other
thus
it
has
been
disputed
whether
linguistic
be
a
scientific
or
a
historical
discipline
and
the
scientific
having
been
distinguished
from
the
historical
it
has
been
asked
whether
it
belong
to
the
order
of
the
natural
or
of
the
psychological
sciences
by
the
latter
being
understood
empirical
psychology
as
much
as
the
science
of
the
spirit
the
same
has
happened
with
aesthetic
which
some
have
looked
upon
as
a
natural
science
confounding
aesthetic
expression
with
physical
expression
others
have
looked
upon
it
as
a
psychological
science
confounding
expression
in
its
universality
with
the
empirical
classification
of
expressions
others
again
denying
the
very
possibility
of
a
science
of
such
a
subject
have
looked
upon
it
as
a
collection
of
historical
facts
finally
it
has
been
realized
that
it
belongs
to
the
sciences
of
activity
or
of
values
which
are
the
spiritual
sciences
linguistic
expression
or
speech
has
often
seemed
to
be
a
fact
of
which
belongs
to
the
physical
expressions
of
the
feelings
common
alike
to
men
and
animals
but
it
was
soon
admitted
that
an
abyss
yawns
between
the
ah
which
is
a
physical
reflex
of
pain
and
a
word
as
also
between
that
ah
of
pain
and
the
ah
employed
as
a
word
the
theory
of
the
interjection
being
abandoned
jocosely
termed
the
ah
ah
theory
by
german
linguists
the
theory
of
or
appeared
this
theory
was
refuted
by
the
same
objection
which
destroyed
aesthetic
associationism
in
general
speech
is
unity
not
multiplicity
of
images
and
multiplicity
does
not
explain
but
presupposes
the
existence
of
the
expression
to
explain
a
variant
of
linguistic
associationism
is
the
imitative
that
is
to
say
the
theory
of
the
onomatopoeia
which
the
same
philologists
deride
under
the
name
of
the
theory
after
the
imitation
of
the
dog
bark
which
according
to
the
onomatopoeists
gives
its
name
to
the
dog
the
most
usual
theory
of
our
times
as
regards
language
apart
from
mere
crass
naturalism
consists
of
a
sort
of
eclecticism
or
mixture
of
the
various
theories
to
which
we
have
referred
it
is
assumed
that
language
is
in
part
the
product
of
interjections
and
in
part
of
onomatopes
and
conventions
this
doctrine
is
altogether
worthy
of
the
scientific
and
philosophic
decadence
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
sidenote
of
language
and
its
we
must
here
note
a
mistake
into
which
have
fallen
those
very
philologists
who
have
best
penetrated
the
active
nature
of
language
these
although
they
admit
that
language
was
a
spiritual
yet
maintain
that
it
was
largely
increased
later
by
but
the
distinction
does
not
prevail
for
origin
in
this
case
can
not
mean
anything
but
nature
or
essence
if
therefore
language
be
a
spiritual
creation
it
will
always
be
a
creation
if
it
be
association
it
will
have
been
so
from
the
beginning
the
mistake
has
arisen
from
not
having
grasped
the
general
principle
of
aesthetic
which
we
have
noted
namely
that
expressions
already
produced
must
redescend
to
the
rank
of
impressions
before
they
can
give
rise
to
new
impressions
when
we
utter
new
words
we
generally
transform
the
old
ones
varying
or
enlarging
their
meaning
but
this
process
is
not
associative
it
is
creative
although
the
creation
has
for
material
the
impressions
not
of
the
hypothetical
primitive
man
but
of
man
who
has
lived
long
ages
in
society
and
who
has
so
to
say
stored
so
many
things
in
his
psychic
organism
and
among
them
so
much
language
sidenote
between
grammar
and
the
question
of
the
distinction
between
the
aesthetic
and
the
intellectual
fact
has
appeared
in
linguistic
as
that
of
the
relations
between
grammar
and
logic
this
question
has
found
two
solutions
which
are
partially
true
that
of
the
indissolubility
of
logic
and
grammar
and
that
of
their
dissolubility
the
complete
solution
is
this
if
the
logical
form
be
indissoluble
from
the
grammatical
aesthetic
the
grammatical
is
dissoluble
from
the
logical
sidenote
classes
or
parts
of
if
we
look
at
a
picture
which
for
example
portrays
a
man
walking
on
a
country
road
we
can
say
this
picture
represents
a
fact
of
movement
which
if
conceived
as
volitional
is
called
and
because
every
movement
implies
and
every
action
a
being
that
acts
this
picture
also
represents
either
or
a
but
this
movement
takes
place
in
a
definite
place
which
is
a
part
of
a
given
the
earth
and
precisely
in
that
part
of
it
which
is
called
and
more
properly
in
a
part
of
it
that
is
wooded
and
covered
with
grass
which
is
called
cut
naturally
or
artificially
in
a
manner
which
is
called
now
there
is
only
one
example
of
that
given
star
which
is
called
earth
earth
is
an
but
are
or
because
there
are
other
other
countries
other
roads
and
it
would
be
possible
to
continue
for
a
while
with
similar
considerations
by
substituting
a
phrase
for
the
picture
that
we
have
imagined
for
example
one
to
this
effect
peter
is
walking
on
a
country
road
and
by
making
the
same
remarks
we
obtain
the
concepts
of
motion
or
action
of
matter
or
agent
of
of
and
so
on
what
have
we
done
in
both
cases
neither
more
nor
less
than
to
submit
to
logical
elaboration
what
was
first
elaborated
only
aesthetically
that
is
to
say
we
have
destroyed
the
aesthetical
by
the
logical
but
as
in
general
aesthetic
error
begins
when
it
is
wished
to
return
from
the
logical
to
the
aesthetical
and
it
is
asked
what
is
the
expression
of
movement
action
matter
being
of
the
general
of
the
individual
etc
thus
in
like
manner
with
language
error
begins
when
motion
or
action
are
called
verb
being
or
matter
noun
or
substantive
and
when
linguistic
categories
or
of
are
made
of
all
these
noun
and
verb
and
so
on
the
theory
of
parts
of
speech
is
at
bottom
altogether
the
same
as
that
of
artistic
and
literary
classes
already
criticized
in
the
aesthetic
it
is
false
to
say
that
the
verb
or
the
noun
is
expressed
in
definite
words
truly
distinguishable
from
others
expression
is
an
indivisible
whole
noun
and
verb
do
not
exist
in
themselves
but
are
abstractions
made
by
our
destroying
the
sole
linguistic
reality
which
is
this
last
is
to
be
understood
not
in
the
usual
mode
of
grammarians
but
as
an
organism
expressive
of
a
complete
meaning
from
an
exclamation
to
a
poem
this
sounds
paradoxical
but
is
nevertheless
a
most
simple
truth
and
as
in
aesthetic
the
artistic
productions
of
certain
peoples
have
been
looked
upon
as
imperfect
owing
to
the
error
above
mentioned
because
the
supposed
kinds
have
seemed
still
to
be
indiscriminate
or
absent
with
them
so
in
linguistic
the
theory
of
the
parts
of
speech
has
caused
the
analogous
error
of
dividing
languages
into
formed
and
unformed
according
to
whether
there
appear
in
them
or
not
some
of
those
supposed
parts
of
speech
for
example
the
verb
sidenote
individuality
of
speech
and
the
classification
of
linguistic
also
discovered
the
irreducible
individuality
of
the
aesthetic
fact
when
it
affirmed
that
the
word
is
what
is
really
spoken
and
that
two
truly
identical
words
do
not
exist
thus
were
synonyms
and
homonyms
destroyed
and
thus
was
shown
the
impossibility
of
really
translating
one
word
into
another
from
dialect
into
language
and
from
a
into
a
foreign
tongue
but
the
attempt
to
classify
languages
agrees
ill
with
this
correct
view
languages
have
no
reality
beyond
the
propositions
and
complexes
of
propositions
really
written
and
pronounced
by
given
peoples
for
definite
periods
that
is
to
say
they
have
no
existence
outside
the
works
of
art
in
which
they
exist
concretely
what
is
the
art
of
a
given
people
but
the
complex
of
all
its
artistic
products
what
is
the
character
of
an
art
say
hellenic
art
or
provençal
literature
but
the
complex
physiognomy
of
those
products
and
how
can
such
a
question
be
answered
save
by
giving
the
history
of
their
art
of
their
literature
that
is
to
say
of
their
language
in
action
it
will
seem
that
this
argument
although
possessing
value
as
against
many
of
the
wonted
classifications
of
languages
yet
is
without
any
as
regards
that
queen
of
classifications
the
that
glory
of
comparative
philology
and
this
is
certainly
true
but
why
precisely
because
the
method
is
not
a
classification
he
who
writes
history
does
not
classify
and
the
philologists
themselves
have
hastened
to
say
that
the
languages
which
can
be
arranged
in
a
historical
series
those
whose
series
have
been
traced
are
not
distinct
and
definite
species
but
a
complex
of
facts
in
the
various
phases
of
its
development
sidenote
of
a
normative
language
has
sometimes
been
looked
upon
as
an
act
of
volition
or
of
choice
but
others
have
discovered
the
impossibility
of
creating
language
artificially
by
an
act
of
will
caesar
civitatem
dare
potes
homini
verbo
non
poles
was
once
said
to
the
roman
emperor
the
aesthetic
and
therefore
theoretic
nature
of
expression
supplies
the
method
of
correcting
the
scientific
error
which
lies
in
the
conception
of
a
normative
containing
the
rules
of
speaking
well
good
sense
has
always
rebelled
against
this
error
an
example
of
such
rebellion
is
the
so
much
the
worse
for
grammar
of
voltaire
but
the
impossibility
of
a
normative
grammar
is
also
recognized
by
those
who
teach
it
when
they
confess
that
to
write
well
can
not
be
learned
by
rules
that
there
are
no
rules
without
exceptions
and
that
the
study
of
grammar
should
be
conducted
practically
by
reading
and
by
examples
which
form
the
literary
taste
the
scientific
reason
of
this
impossibility
lies
in
what
we
have
already
proved
that
a
technique
of
the
theoretical
amounts
to
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
what
could
a
normative
grammar
be
but
just
a
technique
of
linguistic
expression
that
is
to
say
of
a
theoretic
fact
sidenote
the
case
in
which
grammar
is
understood
merely
as
an
empirical
discipline
that
is
to
say
as
a
collection
of
groups
useful
for
learning
languages
without
any
claim
whatever
to
philosophic
truth
is
quite
different
even
the
abstractions
of
the
parts
of
speech
are
in
this
case
both
admissible
and
of
assistance
many
books
entitled
treatises
of
linguistic
have
a
merely
didactic
purpose
they
are
simply
scholastic
manuals
we
find
in
them
in
truth
a
little
of
everything
from
the
description
of
the
vocal
apparatus
and
of
the
artificial
machines
phonographs
which
can
imitate
it
to
summaries
of
the
most
important
results
obtained
by
semitic
coptic
chinese
or
other
philologies
from
philosophic
generalizations
on
the
origin
or
nature
of
language
to
advice
on
calligraphy
and
the
arrangement
of
schedules
for
philological
spoils
but
this
mass
of
notions
which
is
here
taught
in
a
fragmentary
and
incomplete
manner
as
regards
the
language
in
its
essence
the
language
as
expression
resolves
itself
into
notions
of
aesthetic
nothing
exists
outside
which
gives
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
language
and
which
is
a
pedagogic
expedient
save
the
of
in
their
living
reality
that
is
the
history
of
concrete
literary
productions
which
is
substantially
identical
with
the
of
sidenote
linguistic
facts
or
the
same
mistake
of
confusing
the
physical
with
the
aesthetic
from
which
the
elementary
forms
of
the
beautiful
originate
is
made
by
those
who
seek
for
elementary
aesthetic
facts
decorating
with
that
name
the
divisions
of
the
longer
series
of
physical
sounds
into
shorter
series
syllables
vowels
and
consonants
and
the
series
of
syllables
called
words
which
give
no
definite
sense
when
taken
alone
are
not
facts
of
language
but
simple
physical
concepts
of
sounds
another
mistake
of
the
same
sort
is
that
of
roots
to
which
the
most
able
philologists
now
accord
but
a
very
limited
value
having
confused
physical
with
linguistic
or
expressive
facts
and
observing
that
in
the
order
of
ideas
the
simple
precedes
the
complex
they
necessarily
ended
by
thinking
that
physical
facts
were
more
hence
the
imaginary
necessity
that
the
most
antique
primitive
languages
had
been
monosyllabic
and
that
the
progress
of
historical
research
must
lead
to
the
discovery
of
monosyllabic
roots
but
to
follow
up
the
imaginary
hypothesis
the
first
expression
that
the
first
man
conceived
may
also
have
had
a
mimetic
not
a
phonic
reflex
it
may
have
been
exteriorised
not
in
a
sound
but
in
a
gesture
and
assuming
that
it
was
exteriorised
in
a
sound
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
sound
to
have
been
monosyllabic
rather
than
plurisyllabic
philologists
frequently
blame
their
own
ignorance
and
impotence
if
they
do
not
always
succeed
in
reducing
plurisyllabism
to
monosyllabism
and
they
trust
in
the
future
but
their
faith
is
without
foundation
as
their
blame
of
themselves
is
an
act
of
humility
arising
from
an
erroneous
presumption
furthermore
the
limits
of
syllables
as
those
of
words
are
altogether
arbitrary
and
distinguished
as
well
as
may
be
by
empirical
use
primitive
speech
or
the
speech
of
the
uncultured
man
is
unaccompanied
by
any
reflex
consciousness
of
the
divisions
of
the
word
and
of
the
syllables
which
are
taught
at
school
no
true
law
of
linguistic
can
be
founded
on
such
divisions
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
confession
of
linguists
that
there
are
no
truly
phonetic
laws
of
the
hiatus
of
cacophony
of
diaeresis
of
synaeresis
but
merely
laws
of
taste
and
convenience
that
is
to
say
laws
and
what
are
the
laws
of
which
are
not
at
the
same
time
laws
of
sidenote
judgment
and
the
model
the
search
for
a
or
for
a
method
of
reducing
linguistic
usage
to
arises
from
the
misconception
of
a
rationalistic
measurement
of
the
beautiful
from
the
concept
which
we
have
termed
that
of
false
aesthetic
absoluteness
in
italy
we
call
this
question
that
of
the
of
the
language
is
perpetual
creation
what
has
been
linguistically
expressed
can
not
be
repeated
save
by
the
reproduction
of
what
has
already
been
produced
the
impressions
give
rise
to
continuous
changes
of
sounds
and
of
meanings
that
is
to
expressions
to
seek
the
model
language
then
is
to
seek
the
immobility
of
motion
every
one
speaks
and
should
speak
according
to
the
echoes
which
things
arouse
in
his
soul
that
is
according
to
his
impressions
it
is
not
without
reason
that
the
most
convinced
supporter
of
any
one
of
the
solutions
of
the
problem
of
the
unity
of
language
be
it
by
the
use
of
latin
of
italian
or
of
florentine
feels
a
repugnance
in
applying
his
theory
when
he
is
speaking
in
order
to
communicate
his
thoughts
and
to
make
himself
understood
the
reason
for
this
is
that
he
feels
that
were
he
to
substitute
latin
italian
or
florentine
speech
for
that
of
a
different
origin
but
which
answers
to
his
impressions
he
would
be
falsifying
the
latter
he
would
become
a
vain
listener
to
himself
instead
of
a
speaker
a
pedant
in
place
of
a
serious
man
a
histrion
instead
of
a
sincere
person
to
write
according
to
a
theory
is
not
really
to
write
at
the
most
it
is
the
question
of
the
unity
of
language
is
always
reappearing
because
put
as
it
is
there
can
be
no
solution
to
it
owing
to
its
being
based
upon
a
false
conception
of
what
language
is
language
is
not
an
arsenal
of
arms
and
it
is
not
which
in
so
far
as
it
is
thought
of
as
progressive
and
in
living
use
is
always
a
cemetery
containing
corpses
more
or
less
well
embalmed
that
is
to
say
a
collection
of
abstractions
our
mode
of
settling
the
question
of
the
model
language
or
of
the
unity
of
the
language
may
seem
somewhat
abrupt
and
yet
we
would
not
wish
to
appear
otherwise
than
respectful
towards
the
long
line
of
literary
men
who
have
debated
this
question
in
italy
for
centuries
but
those
ardent
debates
were
at
bottom
debates
upon
aestheticity
not
upon
aesthetic
science
upon
literature
rather
than
upon
literary
theory
upon
effective
speaking
and
writing
not
upon
linguistic
science
their
error
consisted
in
transforming
the
manifestation
of
a
want
into
a
scientific
thesis
the
need
of
understanding
one
another
more
easily
among
a
people
dialectically
divided
in
the
philosophic
search
for
a
language
which
should
be
one
or
ideal
such
a
search
was
as
absurd
as
that
other
search
for
a
with
the
immobility
of
the
concept
and
of
the
abstraction
the
social
need
for
a
better
understanding
of
one
another
can
not
be
satisfied
save
by
universal
culture
by
the
increase
of
communications
and
by
the
interchange
of
thought
among
men
sidenote
these
observations
must
suffice
to
show
that
all
the
scientific
problems
of
linguistic
are
the
same
as
those
of
aesthetic
and
that
the
truths
and
errors
of
the
one
are
the
truths
and
errors
of
the
other
if
linguistic
and
aesthetic
appear
to
be
two
different
sciences
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
people
think
of
the
former
as
grammar
or
as
a
mixture
between
philosophy
and
grammar
that
is
an
arbitrary
mnemonic
scheme
they
do
not
think
of
it
as
a
rational
science
and
as
a
pure
philosophy
of
speech
grammar
or
something
grammatical
also
causes
the
prejudice
in
people
minds
that
the
reality
of
language
lies
in
isolated
and
combinable
words
not
in
living
discourse
among
expressive
organisms
rationally
indivisible
those
linguists
or
glottologists
with
philosophical
endowments
who
have
best
fathomed
questions
of
language
resemble
to
employ
a
worn
but
efficacious
figure
workmen
piercing
a
tunnel
at
a
certain
point
they
must
hear
the
voices
of
their
companions
the
philosophers
of
aesthetic
who
have
been
piercing
it
from
the
other
side
at
a
certain
stage
of
scientific
elaboration
linguistic
in
so
far
as
it
is
philosophy
must
be
merged
in
aesthetic
and
indeed
it
is
merged
in
it
without
leaving
a
residue
historical
summary
i
aesthetic
ideas
in
antiquity
the
question
as
to
whether
aesthetic
should
be
looked
upon
as
ancient
or
modern
has
often
been
discussed
the
answer
will
depend
upon
the
view
taken
of
the
nature
of
aesthetic
benedetto
croce
has
proved
that
aesthetic
is
science
of
expressive
but
this
knowledge
can
not
be
reached
until
has
been
defined
the
nature
of
imagination
of
representation
of
expression
or
whatever
we
may
term
that
faculty
which
is
theoretic
but
not
intellectual
which
gives
knowledge
of
the
individual
but
not
of
the
universal
now
the
deviations
from
this
the
correct
theory
may
arise
in
two
ways
by
or
by
negation
of
the
special
aesthetic
activity
or
of
its
autonomy
is
an
instance
of
the
former
this
amounts
to
a
mutilation
of
the
reality
of
the
spirit
of
the
latter
the
substitution
or
superposition
of
another
mysterious
and
activity
is
an
example
these
errors
each
take
several
forms
that
which
errs
by
defect
may
be
pure
hedonism
which
looks
upon
art
as
merely
sensual
pleasure
rigoristic
hedonism
agreeing
with
but
adding
that
art
is
irreconcilable
with
the
loftiest
activities
of
man
moralistic
or
pedagogic
hedonism
which
admits
with
the
two
former
that
art
is
mere
sensuality
but
believes
that
it
may
not
only
be
harmless
but
of
some
service
to
morals
if
kept
in
proper
subjection
and
obedience
the
error
by
excess
also
assumes
several
forms
but
these
are
indeterminable
this
view
is
fully
dealt
with
under
the
name
of
in
the
theory
and
in
the
appendix
antiquity
was
occupied
with
the
problem
in
all
these
forms
in
greece
the
problem
of
art
and
of
the
artistic
faculty
arose
for
the
first
time
after
the
sophistic
movement
as
a
result
of
the
socratic
polemic
with
the
appearance
of
the
word
or
we
have
a
first
attempt
at
grouping
the
arts
and
the
expression
allegoric
or
its
equivalent
used
in
defence
of
homer
poetry
reminds
us
of
what
plato
called
the
old
quarrel
between
philosophy
and
poetry
but
when
internal
facts
were
all
looked
upon
as
mere
phenomena
of
opinion
or
feeling
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
of
illusion
or
of
arbitrary
caprice
there
could
be
no
question
of
beautiful
or
ugly
of
difference
between
the
true
and
the
beautiful
or
between
the
beautiful
and
the
good
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
art
assumes
as
solved
those
problems
concerning
the
difference
between
rational
and
irrational
material
and
spiritual
bare
fact
and
value
etc
this
was
first
done
in
the
socratic
period
and
therefore
the
aesthetic
problem
could
only
arise
after
socrates
and
in
fact
it
does
arise
with
plato
author
of
the
only
great
negation
of
art
which
appears
in
the
history
of
is
art
rational
or
irrational
does
it
belong
to
the
noble
region
of
the
soul
where
dwell
philosophy
and
virtue
or
does
it
cohabit
with
sensuality
and
with
crude
passion
in
the
lower
regions
this
was
the
question
that
plato
asked
and
thus
was
the
aesthetic
problem
stated
for
the
first
time
his
gorgias
remarks
with
sceptical
acumen
that
tragedy
is
a
deception
which
brings
honour
alike
to
deceived
and
to
deceiver
and
therefore
it
is
blameworthy
not
to
know
how
to
deceive
and
not
to
allow
oneself
to
be
deceived
this
suffices
for
gorgias
but
plato
the
philosopher
must
resolve
the
doubt
if
it
be
in
fact
deception
down
with
tragedy
and
the
other
arts
if
it
be
not
deception
then
what
is
the
place
of
tragedy
in
philosophy
and
in
the
righteous
life
his
answer
was
that
art
or
mimetic
does
not
realize
the
ideas
or
the
truth
of
things
but
merely
reproduces
natural
or
artificial
things
which
are
themselves
mere
shadows
of
the
ideas
art
then
is
but
a
shadow
of
a
shadow
a
thing
of
degree
the
artificer
fashions
the
object
which
the
painter
paints
the
artificer
copies
the
divine
idea
and
the
painter
copies
him
art
therefore
does
not
belong
to
the
rational
but
to
the
irrational
sensual
sphere
of
the
soul
it
can
serve
but
for
sensual
pleasure
which
disturbs
and
obscures
therefore
must
mimetic
poetry
and
poets
be
excluded
from
the
perfect
republic
plato
observed
with
truth
that
imitation
does
not
rise
to
the
logical
or
conceptual
sphere
of
which
poets
and
painters
as
such
are
in
fact
ignorant
but
he
to
that
there
could
be
any
form
of
knowledge
other
than
the
intellectual
we
now
know
that
intuition
lies
on
this
side
or
outside
the
intellect
from
which
it
differs
as
much
as
it
does
from
passion
and
sensuality
plato
with
his
fine
aesthetic
sense
would
have
been
grateful
to
anyone
who
could
have
shown
him
how
to
place
art
which
he
loved
and
practised
so
supremely
himself
among
the
lofty
activities
of
the
spirit
but
in
his
day
no
one
could
give
him
such
assistance
his
conscience
and
his
reason
saw
that
art
makes
the
false
seem
the
true
and
therefore
he
resolutely
banished
it
to
the
lower
regions
of
the
spirit
the
tendency
among
those
who
followed
plato
in
time
was
to
find
some
means
of
retaining
art
and
of
depriving
it
of
the
baleful
influence
which
it
was
believed
to
exercise
life
without
art
was
to
the
greek
an
impossibility
although
he
was
equally
conscious
of
the
demands
of
reason
and
of
morality
thus
it
happened
that
art
which
on
the
purely
hedonistic
hypothesis
had
been
treated
as
a
beautiful
courtezan
became
in
the
hands
of
the
moralist
a
pedagogue
aristophanes
and
strabo
and
above
all
aristotle
dwell
upon
the
didactic
and
moralistic
possibility
of
poetry
for
plutarch
poetry
seems
to
have
been
a
sort
of
preparation
for
philosophy
a
twilight
to
which
the
eyes
should
grow
accustomed
before
emerging
into
the
full
light
of
day
among
the
romans
we
find
lucretius
comparing
the
beauties
of
his
great
poem
to
the
sweet
yellow
honey
with
which
doctors
are
wont
to
anoint
the
rim
of
the
cup
containing
their
bitter
drugs
horace
as
so
frequently
takes
his
inspiration
from
the
greek
when
he
offers
the
double
view
of
art
as
courtezan
and
as
pedagogue
in
his
occur
the
passages
in
which
we
find
mingled
with
the
poetic
function
that
of
the
orator
the
practical
and
the
aesthetic
was
virgil
a
poet
or
an
orator
the
triple
duty
of
pleasing
moving
and
teaching
was
imposed
upon
the
poet
then
with
a
thought
for
the
supposed
meretricious
nature
of
their
art
the
ingenious
horace
remarks
that
both
must
employ
the
seductions
of
form
the
view
of
art
appeared
only
in
late
antiquity
with
plotinus
the
curious
error
of
looking
upon
plato
as
the
head
of
this
school
and
as
the
father
of
aesthetic
assumes
that
he
who
felt
obliged
to
banish
art
altogether
from
the
domain
of
the
higher
functions
of
the
spirit
was
yet
ready
to
yield
to
it
the
highest
place
there
the
mystical
view
of
aesthetic
accords
a
lofty
place
indeed
to
aesthetic
placing
it
even
above
philosophy
the
enthusiastic
praise
of
the
beautiful
to
be
found
in
the
and
is
responsible
for
this
misunderstanding
but
it
is
well
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
the
beautiful
of
which
plato
discourses
in
those
dialogues
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
beautiful
nor
with
the
mysticism
of
the
yet
the
thinkers
of
antiquity
were
aware
that
a
problem
lay
in
the
direction
of
aesthetic
and
xenophon
records
the
sayings
of
socrates
that
the
beautiful
is
that
which
is
fitting
and
answers
to
the
end
required
elsewhere
he
says
it
is
that
which
is
loved
plato
likewise
vibrates
between
various
views
and
offers
several
solutions
sometimes
he
appears
almost
to
confound
the
beautiful
with
the
true
the
good
and
the
divine
at
others
he
leans
toward
the
utilitarian
view
of
socrates
at
others
he
distinguishes
between
what
is
beautiful
in
itself
and
what
possesses
but
a
relative
beauty
at
other
times
again
he
is
a
hedonist
and
makes
it
to
consist
of
pure
pleasure
that
is
of
pleasure
with
no
shadow
of
pain
or
he
finds
it
in
measure
and
proportion
or
in
the
very
sound
the
very
colour
itself
the
reason
for
all
this
vacillation
of
definition
lay
in
plato
exclusion
of
the
artistic
or
mimetic
fact
from
the
domain
of
the
higher
spiritual
activities
the
expresses
this
uncertainty
more
completely
than
any
of
the
other
dialogues
what
is
the
beautiful
that
is
the
question
asked
at
the
beginning
and
left
unanswered
at
the
end
the
platonic
socrates
and
hippias
propose
the
most
various
solutions
one
after
another
but
always
come
out
by
the
gate
by
which
they
entered
in
is
the
beautiful
to
be
found
in
ornament
no
for
gold
embellishes
only
where
it
is
in
keeping
is
the
beautiful
that
which
seems
ugly
to
no
man
but
it
is
a
question
of
being
not
of
seeming
is
it
their
fitness
which
makes
things
seem
beautiful
but
in
that
case
the
fitness
which
makes
them
appear
beautiful
is
one
thing
the
beautiful
another
if
the
beautiful
be
the
useful
or
that
which
leads
to
an
end
then
evil
would
also
be
beautiful
because
the
useful
may
also
end
evilly
is
the
beautiful
the
helpful
that
which
leads
to
the
good
no
for
in
that
case
the
good
would
not
be
beautiful
nor
the
beautiful
good
because
cause
and
effect
are
different
thus
they
argued
in
the
platonic
dialogues
and
when
we
turn
to
the
pages
of
aristotle
we
find
him
also
uncertain
and
inclined
to
vary
his
definitions
sometimes
for
him
the
good
and
pleasurable
are
the
beautiful
sometimes
it
lies
in
actions
at
others
in
things
motionless
or
in
bulk
and
order
or
is
altogether
undefinable
antiquity
also
established
canons
of
the
beautiful
and
the
famous
canon
of
polycleitus
on
the
proportions
of
the
human
body
fitly
compares
with
that
of
later
times
on
the
golden
line
and
with
the
ciceronian
phrase
from
the
tusculan
disputations
but
these
are
all
of
them
mere
empirical
observations
mere
happy
remarks
and
verbal
substitutions
which
lead
to
unsurmountable
difficulties
when
put
to
philosophical
test
one
important
identification
is
absent
in
all
those
early
attempts
at
truth
the
beautiful
is
never
identified
with
art
and
the
artistic
fact
is
always
clearly
distinguished
from
beauty
mimetic
from
its
content
plotinus
first
identified
the
two
and
with
him
the
beautiful
and
art
are
dissolved
together
in
a
passion
and
mystic
elevation
of
the
spirit
the
beauty
of
natural
objects
is
the
archetype
existing
in
the
soul
which
is
the
fountain
of
all
natural
beauty
thus
was
plato
he
said
in
error
when
he
despised
the
arts
for
imitating
nature
for
nature
herself
imitates
the
idea
and
art
also
seeks
her
inspiration
directly
from
those
ideas
whence
nature
proceeds
we
have
here
with
plotinus
and
with
neoplatonism
the
first
appearance
in
the
world
of
mystical
aesthetic
destined
to
play
so
important
a
part
in
later
aesthetic
theory
aristotle
was
far
more
happy
in
his
attempts
at
defining
aesthetic
as
the
science
of
representation
and
of
expression
than
in
his
definitions
of
the
beautiful
he
felt
that
some
element
of
the
problem
had
been
overlooked
and
in
attempting
in
his
turn
a
solution
he
had
the
advantage
over
plato
of
looking
upon
the
ideas
as
simple
concepts
not
as
hypostases
of
concepts
or
of
abstractions
thus
reality
was
more
vivid
for
aristotle
it
was
the
synthesis
of
matter
and
form
he
saw
that
art
or
mimetic
was
a
theoretic
fact
or
a
mode
of
contemplation
but
if
poetry
be
a
theoretic
fact
in
what
way
is
it
to
be
distinguished
from
science
and
from
historical
knowledge
thus
magnificently
does
the
great
philosopher
pose
the
problem
at
the
commencement
of
his
and
thus
alone
can
it
be
posed
successfully
we
ask
the
same
question
in
the
same
words
but
the
problem
is
difficult
and
the
masterly
statement
of
it
was
not
equalled
by
the
method
of
solution
then
available
he
made
an
excellent
start
on
his
voyage
of
discovery
but
stopped
half
way
irresolute
and
perplexed
poetry
he
says
differs
from
history
by
portraying
the
possible
while
history
deals
with
what
has
really
happened
poetry
like
philosophy
aims
at
the
universal
but
in
a
different
way
which
the
philosopher
indicates
as
something
more
tha
which
differentiates
poetry
from
history
occupied
with
the
particular
tha
kath
what
then
is
the
possible
the
something
more
and
the
particular
of
poetry
aristotle
immediately
falls
into
error
and
confusion
when
he
attempts
to
define
these
words
since
art
has
to
deal
with
the
absurd
and
with
the
impossible
it
can
not
be
anything
rational
but
a
mere
imitation
of
reality
in
accordance
with
the
platonic
theory
a
fact
of
sensual
pleasure
aristotle
does
not
however
attain
to
so
precise
a
definition
as
plato
whose
erroneous
definition
he
does
not
succeed
in
supplanting
the
truth
is
that
he
failed
of
his
task
he
failed
to
discern
the
true
nature
of
aesthetic
although
he
restated
and
the
problem
with
such
marvellous
acumen
after
aristotle
there
comes
a
lull
in
the
discussion
until
plotinus
the
were
generally
little
studied
and
the
admirable
statement
of
the
problem
generally
neglected
by
later
writers
antique
psychology
knew
the
fancy
or
imagination
as
preserving
or
reproducing
sensuous
impressions
or
as
an
intermediary
between
the
concepts
and
feeling
its
autonomous
productive
activity
was
not
yet
understood
in
the
of
apollonius
of
philostratus
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
make
clear
the
difference
between
mimetic
and
creative
imagination
but
this
does
not
in
reality
differ
from
the
aristotelian
mimetic
which
is
concerned
not
only
with
the
real
but
also
with
the
possible
cicero
too
before
philostratus
speaks
of
a
kind
of
exquisite
beauty
lying
hidden
in
the
soul
of
the
artist
which
guides
his
hand
and
art
antiquity
seems
generally
to
have
been
entrammelled
in
the
meshes
of
the
belief
in
mimetic
or
the
duplication
of
natural
objects
by
the
artist
philostratus
and
the
other
protagonists
of
the
imagination
may
have
meant
to
combat
this
error
but
the
shadows
lie
heavy
until
we
reach
plotinus
we
find
already
astir
among
the
sophists
the
question
as
to
the
nature
of
language
admitting
that
language
is
a
sign
are
we
to
take
that
as
signifying
a
spiritual
necessity
or
as
a
psychological
convention
aristotle
made
a
valuable
contribution
to
this
difficult
question
when
he
spoke
of
a
kind
of
proposition
other
than
those
which
predicate
truth
or
falsehood
that
is
logic
with
him
is
the
term
proper
to
designate
desires
and
aspirations
which
are
the
vehicle
of
poetry
and
of
oratory
it
must
be
remembered
that
for
aristotle
words
like
poetry
belonged
to
mimetic
the
profound
remark
about
the
third
mode
of
proposition
would
one
would
have
thought
have
led
naturally
to
the
separation
of
linguistic
from
logic
and
to
its
classification
with
poetry
and
art
but
the
aristotelian
logic
assumed
a
verbal
and
formal
character
which
set
back
the
attainment
of
this
position
by
many
hundred
years
yet
the
genius
of
epicurus
had
an
intuition
of
the
truth
when
he
remarked
that
the
diversity
of
names
for
the
same
things
arose
not
from
arbitrary
caprice
but
from
the
diverse
impression
derived
from
the
same
object
the
stoics
too
seem
to
have
had
an
inkling
of
the
nature
of
speech
but
their
use
of
the
word
leaves
it
doubtful
whether
they
distinguished
by
it
the
linguistic
representation
from
the
abstract
concept
or
rather
generically
the
meaning
from
the
sound
in
the
appendix
will
be
found
further
striking
quotations
from
and
references
to
ii
aesthetic
ideas
in
the
middle
age
and
in
the
renaissance
all
the
theories
of
antique
aesthetic
reappear
in
the
middle
ages

it
were
by
spontaneous
generation
duns

and
these
are
steps
in
the
stair
of
contemplation
of
the
creator
in
this
manner
speculation
began
to
be
diverted
from
the
art
fact
which
had
been
so
prominent
with
plotinus
thomas
aquinas
followed
aristotle
in
distinguishing
the
beautiful
from
the
good
and
applied
his
doctrine
of
imitation
to
the
beauty
of
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
quantum
est
imago
expressa
with
the
troubadours
we
may
find
traces
of
the
hedonistic
view
of
art
and
the
rigoristic
hypothesis
finds
in
tertullian
and
in
certain
fathers
of
the
church
staunch
upholders
the
retrograde
savonarola
occupied
the
same
position
at
a
later
period
but
the
narcotic
moralistic
or
pedagogic
view
mostly
prevailed
for
it
best
suited
an
epoch
of
relative
decadence
in
culture
it
suited
admirably
the
middle
age
offering
at
once
an
excuse
for
the
christian
art
and
for
those
works
of
classical
or
pagan
art
which
yet
survived
specimens
of
this
view
abound
all
through
the
middle
age
we
find
it
for
instance
in
the
criticism
of
virgil
to
whose
work
were
attributed
four
distinct
meanings
literal
allegorical
moral
and
anagogic
for
dante
poetry
was
aliud
quam
fictio
rhetorica
in
musicaque
if
the
vulgar
be
incapable
of
appreciating
my
inner
meaning
then
they
shall
at
least
incline
their
minds
to
the
perfection
of
my
beauty
if
from
me
ye
can
not
gather
wisdom
at
the
least
shall
ye
enjoy
me
as
a
pleasant
thing
thus
spoke
the
muse
of
dante
whose
is
an
attempt
to
aid
the
understanding
in
its
effort
to
grasp
the
moral
and
pedagogic
elements
of
verse
poetry
was
the
a
fiction
containing
many
useful
things
covered
or
veiled
it
would
be
inexact
to
identify
art
in
the
middle
age
with
philosophy
and
theology
its
pleasing
falsity
could
be
adapted
to
useful
ends
much
in
the
same
way
as
matrimony
excuses
love
and
sexual
union
this
however
implies
that
for
the
middle
age
the
ideal
state
was
celibacy
that
is
pure
knowledge
divorced
from
art
the
only
line
of
explanation
that
was
altogether
neglected
in
the
middle
age
was
the
right
one
the
of
aristotle
were
badly
rendered
into
latin
from
the
faulty
paraphrase
of
averroes
by
one
hermann
the
nominalist
and
realist
dispute
brought
again
into
the
arena
the
relations
between
thought
and
speech
and
we
find
duns
scotus
occupied
with
the
problem
in
his
modis
significandi
seu
grammatica
abelard
had
defined
sensation
as
and
with
the
importance
given
to

with
the
denomination
of
the

as
and
we
enter
upon
a
terminology
which
we
shall
see
appearing
again
big
with
results
at
the
commencement
of
modern
aesthetic
the
doctrine
of
the
middle
age
in
respect
to
art
and
letters
may
thus
be
regarded
as
of
interest
rather
to
the
history
of
culture
than
to
that
of
general
knowledge
a
like
remark
holds
good
of
the
renaissance
theories
of
antiquity
are
studied
countless
treatises
in
many
forms
are
written
upon
them
but
no
really
new
ideas
as
regards
aesthetic
science
appear
on
the
horizon
we
find
among
the
spokesmen
of
mystical
aesthetic
in
the
thirteenth
century
such
names
as
marsilio
ficino
and
pico
della
mirandola
bembo
and
many
others
wrote
on
the
beautiful
and
on
love
in
the
century

followed

in

by
a
spanish
jew
named

published

a
european
success
being
translated
into
many
languages
he
talks
of
the
universality
of
love
and
of
its
origin
of
beauty
that
is
grace
which
delights
the
soul
and
impels
it
to
love
knowledge
of
lesser
beauties
leads
to
loftier
spiritual
beauties
leone
called
these
remarks
petrarch
followers
versified
similar
intuitions
while
others
wrote
parodies
and
burlesques
of
this
style

to
give
rules

imparting

arithmetical
proportions
others

special
meanings
in
colours
while
the
platonicians
placed
the
seat
of
beauty
in
the
soul
the
aristotelians
in
physical
qualities
agostino
nifo
the
averroist
after
some
inconclusive
remarks
is
at
last
fortunate
enough
to
discover
where
natural
beauty
really
dwells
its
abode
is
the
body
of
giovanna
princess
of
tagliacozzo
to
whom
he
dedicates
his
book

the
speculations
of

with
those
of

his
looks
upon
the
beautiful
as
the
ugly
as
by
goodness
he
means
power
wisdom
and
love
campanella
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
erroneous
platonic
conception
of
the
beautiful
but
the
use
of
the
word
in
this
place
represents
progress
it
enabled
him
to
see
that
things
in
themselves
are
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
nothing
proves
more
clearly
that
the
renaissance
did
not
overstep
the
limits
of
aesthetic
theory
reached
in
antiquity
than
the
fact
that
the
pedagogic
theory
of
art
continued
to
prevail
in
the
face
of
translations
of
the
of
aristotle
and
of
the
diffuse
labours
expended
upon
that
work
this
theory
was
even
grafted
upon
the
where
one
is
surprised
to
find
it
there
are
a
few
hedonists
standing
out
from
the
general
trend
of
opinion
the
restatement
of
the
pedagogic
position
reinforced
with
examples
taken
from
antiquity
was
disseminated
throughout
europe
by
the
italians
of
the
renaissance
france
spain
england
and
germany
felt
its
influence
and
we
find
the
writers
of
the
period
of
louis
xiv
either
frankly
didactic
like
le

for
whom
the
first
object
of
the
poet
is
to
instruct
or
with
la

speaking
of
poetry
as
cette
science
agréable
qui
mêle
la

des

la

du
langage
for
the
former
of
these
critics
homer
was
the
author
of
two
didactic
manuals
relating
to
military
and
political
matters
the
and
the
didacticism
has
always
been
looked
upon
as
the
poetic
of
the
renaissance
although
the
didactic
is
not
mentioned
among
the
kinds
of
poetry
of
that
period
the
reason
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
for
the
renaissance
all
poetry
was
didactic
in
addition
to
any
other
qualities
which
it
might
possess
the
active
discussion
of
poetic
theory
the
criticism
of
aristotle
and
of
plato
exclusion
of
poetry
of
the
possible
and
of
the
verisimilar
if
it
did
not
contribute
much
original
material
to
the
theory
of
art
yet
at
any
rate
sowed
the
seeds
which
afterwards
germinated
and
bore
fruit
why
they
asked
with
aristotle
at
the
renaissance
does
poetry
deal
with
the
universal
history
with
the
particular
what
is
the
reason
for
poetry
being
obliged
to
seek
verisimilitude
what
does
raphael
mean
by
the
certain
idea
which
he
follows
in
his
painting
these
themes
and
others
cognate
were
dealt
with
by
italian
and
by
spanish
writers
who
occasionally
reveal
wonderful
acumen
as
when
francesco
patrizio
criticizing
aristotle
theory
of
imitation
remarks
all
languages
and
all
philosophic
writings
and
all
other
writings
would
be
poetry
because
they
are
made
of
words
and
words
are
imitations
but
as
yet
no
one
dared
follow
such
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
and
the
renaissance
closes
with
the
sense
of
a
mystery
yet
to
be
revealed
iii
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
the
seventeenth
century
is
remarkable
for
the
ferment
of
thought
upon
this
difficult
problem
such
words
as
genius
taste
imagination
or
fancy
and
feeling
appear
in
this
literature
and
deserve
a
passing
notice
as
regards
the
word
genius
we
find
the
italian
ingegno
opposed
to
the
intellect
and
dialectic
adorned
with
the
attributes
of
the
latter
while
rhetoric
has
the
advantage
of
ingegno
in
all
its
forms
such
as
concetti
and
acutezze
with
these
the
english
word
ingenious
has
an
obvious
connection
especially
in
its
earlier
use
as
applied
to
men
of
letters
the
french
worked
upon
the
word
ingegno
and
evolved
from
it
in
various
associations
the
expressions
esprit
beaux
esprits
the
manual
of
the
spanish
jesuit
baltasar
gracian
became
celebrated
throughout
europe
and
here
we
find
ingegno
described
as
the
truly
inventive
faculty
and
from
it
the
english
word
genius
the
italian
genio
the
french
génie
first
enter
into
general
use
the
word
gusto
or
taste
good
taste
in
its
modern
sense
also
sprang
into
use
about
this
time
taste
was
held
to
be
a
judicial
faculty
directed
to
the
beautiful
and
thus
to
some
extent
distinct
from
the
intellectual
judgment
it
was
further
bisected
into
active
and
passive
but
the
former
ran
into
the
definition
of
ingegno
the
latter
described
sterility
the
word
gusto
or
taste
as
judgment
was
in
use
in
italy
at
a
very
early
period
and
in
spain
we
find
lope
di
vega
and
his
contemporaries
declaring
that
their
object
is
to
delight
the
taste
of
their
public
these
uses
of
the
word
are
not
of
significance
as
regards
the
problem
of
art
and
we
must
return
to
baltasar
gracian
for
a
definition
of
taste
as
a
special
faculty
or
attitude
of
the
soul
italian
writers
of
the
period
echo
the
praises
of
this
laconic
moralist
who
when
he
spoke
of
a
man
of
taste
meant
to
describe
what
we
call
a
man
of
tact
in
the
conduct
of
life
the
first
use
of
the
word
in
a
strictly
aesthetic
sense
occurs
in
france
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
la
bruyère
writes
in
his
il
y
a
dans
un
point
de
perfection
comme
de
bonté
ou
de
maturité
dans
la
nature
celui
qui
le
sent
et
qui
a
le
goût
parfait
celui
qui
ne
le
sent
pas
et
qui
aime
au
deçà
ou
au
delà
a
le
goût
défectueux
il
y
a
donc
un
bon
et
un
mauvais
goût
et
dispute
des
goûts
avec
fondement
delicacy
and
variability
or
variety
were
appended
as
attributes
of
taste
this
french
definition
of
the
italian
word
was
speedily
adopted
in
england
where
it
became
good
taste
and
we
find
it
used
in
this
sense
in
italian
and
german
writers
of
about
this
period
the
words
imagination
and
fancy
were
also
passed
through
the
crucible
in
this
century
we
find
the
cardinal
blaming
those
who
look
for
truth
or
falsehood
for
the
verisimilar
or
for
historical
truth
in
poetry
poetry
he
holds
has
to
do
with
the
primary
apprehensions
which
give
neither
truth
nor
falsehood
thus
the
fancy
takes
the
place
of
the
verisimilar
of
certain
students
of
aristotle
the
cardinal
continues
his
eloquence
with
the
clinching
remark
that
if
the
intention
of
poetry
were
to
be
believed
true
then
its
real
end
would
be
falsehood
which
is
absolutely
condemned
by
the
law
of
nature
and
by
god
the
sole
object
of
poetic
fables
is
he
says
to
adorn
our
intellect
with
sumptuous
new
marvellous
and
splendid
imaginings
and
so
great
has
been
the
benefits
accruing
from
this
to
the
human
race
that
poets
have
been
rewarded
with
a
glory
superior
to
any
other
and
their
names
have
been
crowned
with
divine
honours
this
he
says
in
his
treatise
has
been
the
just
reward
of
poets
albeit
they
have
not
been
bearers
of
knowledge
nor
have
they
manifested
truth
this
throwing
of
the
bridle
on
the
neck
of
pegasus
seemed
to
muratori
sixty
years
later
to
be
altogether
too
risky
a
proceeding
although
advocated
by
a
prince
of
the
church
he
reinserts
the
bit
of
the
verisimilar
though
he
talks
with
admiration
of
the
fancy
that
inferior
apprehensive
faculty
which
is
content
to
represent
things
without
seeking
to
know
if
they
be
true
or
false
a
task
which
it
leaves
to
the
superior
apprehensive
faculty
of
the
intellect
the
severe
gravina
too
finds
his
heart
touched
by
the
beauty
of
poetry
when
he
calls
it
a
witch
but
wholesome
as
early
as
huarte
had
maintained
that
eloquence
is
the
work
of
the
imagination
not
of
the
intellect
in
england
bacon
attributed
knowledge
to
the
intellect
history
to
memory
and
poetry
to
the
imagination
or
fancy
hobbes
described
the
manifestations
of
the
latter
and
addison
devoted
several
numbers
of
the
to
the
analysis
of
the
pleasures
of
the
imagination
during
the
same
period
the
division
between
those
who
are
accustomed
à
juger
par
le
sentiment
and
those
who
raisonnent
par
les
principes
became
marked
in
france
du
bos
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
upholder
of
the
feelings
as
regards
the
production
of
art
indeed
there
is
in
his
view
no
other
criterion
and
the
feeling
for
art
is
a
sixth
sense
against
which
intellectual
argument
is
useless
this
french
school
of
thought
found
a
reflex
in
england
with
the
position
assigned
there
to
emotion
in
artistic
work
but
the
confusion
of
such
words
as
imagination
taste
feeling
wit
shows
that
at
this
time
there
was
a
suspicion
that
these
words
were
all
applicable
to
the
same
fact
alexander
pope
thus
distinguished
wit
and
judgment
for
wit
and
judgment
often
are
at
strife
though
meant
each
other
aid
like
man
and
wife
but
there
was
a
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
whether
the
latter
should
be
looked
upon
as
part
of
the
intellect
or
not
there
was
the
same
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
taste
and
intellectual
judgment
as
regards
the
former
the
opposition
to
the
intellectual
principle
was
reinforced
in
the
eighteenth
century
by
kant
in
his
der
but
voltaire
and
writers
anterior
to
him
frequently
fell
back
into
intellectualist
definitions
of
a
word
invented
precisely
to
avoid
them
dacier
writes
of
taste
as
une
harmonie
un
accord
de
et
de
la
raison
the
difficulties
surrounding
a
true
definition
led
to
the
creation
of
the
expression
so
or
ne
sais
or
se
which
throws
into
clear
relief
the
confusion
between
taste
and
intellectual
judgment
as
regards
imagination
and
feeling
or
sentiment
there
was
a
strong
tendency
to
sensualism
the
cardinal
talks
of
poetry
as
ignoring
alike
truth
or
falsehood
and
yet
delighting
the
senses
he
approves
of
the
remark
that
poetry
should
make
us
raise
our
eyebrows
but
in
later
life
this
prince
seems
to
have
fallen
back
from
the
brilliant
intuition
of
his
earlier
years
into
the
pedagogic
theory
muratori
was
convinced
that
fancy
was
entirely
sensual
and
therefore
he
posted
the
intellect
beside
it
to
refrain
its
wild
courses
like
a
friend
having
authority
gravina
practically
coincides
in
this
view
of
poetic
fancy
as
a
subordinate
faculty
incapable
of
knowledge
fit
only
to
be
used
by
moral
philosophy
for
the
introduction
into
the
mind
of
the
true
by
means
of
novelty
and
the
marvellous
in
england
also
bacon
held
poetry
to
belong
to
the
fancy
and
assigned
to
it
a
place
between
history
and
science
epic
poetry
he
awarded
to
the
former
parabolic
poetry
to
the
latter
elsewhere
he
talks
of
poetry
as
a
dream
and
affirms
that
it
is
to
be
held
rather
as
an
amusement
of
the
intelligence
than
as
a
science
for
him
music
painting
sculpture
and
the
other
arts
are
merely
addison
reduced
the
pleasures
of
the
imagination
to
those
caused
by
visible
objects
or
by
ideas
taken
from
them
these
pleasures
he
held
to
be
inferior
to
those
of
the
senses
and
less
refined
than
those
of
the
intellect
he
looked
upon
imaginative
pleasure
as
consisting
in
resemblances
discovered
between
imitations
and
things
imitated
between
copies
and
originals
an
exercise
adapted
to
sharpen
the
spirit
of
observation
the
sensualism
of
the
writers
headed
by
du
bos
who
looked
upon
art
as
a
mere
pastime
like
a
tournament
or
a
shows
that
the
truth
about
aesthetic
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
emerging
from
the
other
spiritual
activities
yet
the
new
words
and
the
new
views
of
the
seventeenth
century
have
great
importance
for
the
origins
of
aesthetic
they
were
the
direct
result
of
the
restatement
of
the
problem
by
the
writers
of
the
renaissance
who
themselves
took
it
up
where
antiquity
had
left
it
these
new
words
and
the
discussions
which
arose
from
them
were
the
demands
of
aesthetic
for
its
theoretical
justification
but
they
were
not
able
to
provide
this
justification
and
it
could
not
come
from
elsewhere
with
descartes
we
are
not
likely
to
find
much
sympathy
for
such
studies
as
relate
to
wit
taste
fancy
or
feelings
he
ignored
the
famous
so
he
abhorred
the
imagination
which
he
believed
to
result
from
the
agitation
of
the
animal
spirits
he
did
not
altogether
condemn
poetry
but
certainly
looked
upon
it
as
the
du
which
must
be
strictly
supervised
by
the
reason
boileau
is
the
aesthetic
equivalent
of
cartesian
intellectualism
boileau
la
raison
à
ses
règles
boileau
the
enthusiast
for
allegory
france
was
infected
with
the
mathematical
spirit
of
cartesianism
and
all
possibility
of
a
serious
consideration
of
poetry
and
of
art
was
thus
removed
witness
the
diatribes
of
malebranche
against
the
imagination
and
listen
to
the
italian
antonio
conti
writing
from
france
in
on
the
theme
of
the
literary
disputes
that
were
raging
at
the
time
they
have
introduced
the
method
of
descartes
into
they
judge
poetry
and
eloquence
independently
of
their
sensible
qualities
thus
they
also
confound
the
progress
of
philosophy
with
that
of
the
arts
the
abbé
terrasson
says
that
the
moderns
are
greater
geometricians
than
the
ancients
therefore
they
are
greater
orators
and
greater
poets
la
motte
fontenelle
boileau
and
malebranche
carried
on
this
battle
which
was
taken
up
by
the
encyclopaedists
and
when
du
bos
published
his
daring
book
jean
jacques
le
bel
published
a
reply
to
it
in
which
he
denied
to
sentiment
its
claim
to
judge
of
art
thus
cartesianism
could
not
possess
an
aesthetic
of
the
imagination
the
cartesian
de
crousaz
found
the
beautiful
to
consist
in
what
is
approved
of
and
thereby
reduced
it
to
ideas
ignoring
the
pleasing
and
sentiment
locke
was
as
intellectualist
in
the
england
of
this
period
as
was
descartes
in
france
he
speaks
of
wit
as
combining
ideas
in
an
agreeable
variety
which
strikes
the
imagination
while
the
intellect
or
judgment
seeks
for
differences
according
to
truth
the
wit
then
consists
of
something
which
is
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
truth
and
reason
for
shaftesbury
taste
is
a
sense
or
instinct
of
the
beautiful
of
order
and
proportion
identical
with
the
moral
sense
and
with
its
preconceptions
anticipating
the
recognition
of
reason
body
spirit
and
god
are
the
three
degrees
of
beauty
francis
hutcheson
proceeded
from
shaftesbury
and
made
popular
the
internal
sense
of
beauty
which
lies
somewhere
between
sensuality
and
rationality
and
is
occupied
with
discussing
unity
in
variety
concord
in
multiplicity
and
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
in
their
substantial
identity
hutcheson
allied
the
pleasure
of
art
with
this
sense
that
is
with
the
pleasure
of
imitation
and
of
the
likeness
of
the
copy
to
the
original
this
he
looked
upon
as
relative
beauty
to
be
distinguished
from
absolute
beauty
the
same
view
dominates
the
english
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
among
whom
may
be
mentioned
reid
the
head
of
the
scottish
school
and
adam
smith
with
far
greater
philosophical
vigour
leibnitz
in
germany
opened
the
door
to
that
crowd
of
psychic
facts
which
cartesian
intellectualism
had
rejected
with
horror
his
conception
of
reality
as
non
facit
left
room
for
imagination
taste
and
their
congeners
leibnitz
believed
that
the
scale
of
being
ascended
from
the
lowliest
to
god
what
we
now
term
aesthetic
facts
were
then
identified
with
what
descartes
and
leibnitz
had
called
confused
knowledge
which
might
become
clear
but
not
distinct
it
might
seem
that
when
he
applied
this
terminology
to
aesthetic
facts
leibnitz
had
recognized
their
peculiar
essence
as
being
neither
sensual
nor
intellectual
they
are
not
sensual
for
him
because
they
have
their
own
clarity
differing
from
pleasure
and
sensual
emotion
and
from
intellectual
distinctio
but
the
leibnitzian
law
of
continuity
and
intellectualism
did
not
permit
of
such
an
interpretation
obscurity
and
clarity
are
here
to
be
understood
as
quantitative
grades
of
a
form
of
knowledge
the
distinct
or
intellectual
toward
which
they
both
tend
and
reach
at
a
superior
grade
though
artists
judge
with
confused
perceptions
which
are
clear
but
not
distinct
these
may
yet
be
corrected
and
proved
true
by
intellective
knowledge
the
intellect
clearly
and
distinctly
knows
the
thing
which
the
imagination
knows
confusedly
but
clearly
this
view
of
leibnitz
amounts
to
saying
that
the
realization
of
a
work
of
art
can
be
perfected
by
intellectually
determining
its
concept
thus
leibnitz
held
that
there
was
only
one
true
form
of
knowledge
and
that
all
other
forms
could
only
reach
perfection
in
that
his
clarity
is
not
a
specific
difference
it
is
merely
a
partial
anticipation
of
his
intellective
distinction
to
have
posited
this
grade
is
an
important
achievement
but
the
view
of
leibnitz
is
not
fundamentally
different
from
that
of
the
creators
of
the
words
and
intuitions
already
studied
all
contributed
to
attract
attention
to
the
peculiarity
of
aesthetic
facts
speculation
on
language
at
this
period
revealed
an
equally
determined
intellectualist
attitude
grammar
was
held
to
be
an
exact
science
and
grammatical
variations
to
be
explainable
by
the
ellipse
by
abbreviation
and
by
failure
to
grasp
the
typical
logical
form
in
france
with
arnauld
we
have
the
rigorous
cartesian
intellectualism
leibnitz
and
locke
both
speculated
upon
this
subject
and
the
former
all
his
life
nourished
the
thought
of
a
universal
language
the
absurdity
of
this
is
proved
in
this
volume
a
complete
change
of
the
cartesian
system
upon
which
leibnitz
based
his
own
was
necessary
if
speculation
were
ever
to
surpass
the
leibnitzian
aesthetic
but
wolff
and
the
other
german
pupils
of
leibnitz
were
as
unable
to
shake
themselves
free
of
the
intellectualism
as
were
the
french
pupils
of
descartes
meanwhile
a
young
student
of
berlin
named
alexander
amedeus
baumgarten
was
studying
the
wolffian
philosophy
and
at
the
same
time
lecturing
in
poetry
and
latin
rhetoric
while
so
doing
he
was
led
to
rethink
and
pose
afresh
the
problem
of
how
to
reduce
the
precepts
of
rhetoric
to
a
rigorous
philosophical
system
thus
it
came
about
that
baumgarten
published
in
september
at
the
age
of
as
the
thesis
for
his
degree
of
doctor
an
opuscule
entitled
philosophicae
de
nonnullis
ad
poèma
and
in
it
we
find
written
the
first
the
word
aesthetic
as
the
name
of
a
special
science
baumgarten
ever
afterwards
attached
great
importance
to
his
juvenile
discovery
and
lectured
upon
it
by
request
in
at
and
again
in
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
in
this
way
emmanuel
kant
first
became
acquainted
with
the
theory
of
aesthetic
which
he
greatly
altered
when
he
came
to
treat
of
it
in
his
philosophy
in
baumgarten
published
the
first
volume
of
a
more
ample
treatise
and
a
second
part
in
but
illness
and
death
in
prevented
his
completing
his
work
what
is
aesthetic
for
baumgarten
it
is
the
science
of
sensible
knowledge
its
objects
are
the
sensible
facts
which
the
greeks
were
always
careful
to
distinguish
from
the
mental
facts
it
is
therefore
cognitionis
sensitivae
theoria
liberalium
artium
gnoseologia
inferior
ars
pulcre
cogitandi
ars
analogi
rhetoric
and
poetic
are
for
him
special
cases
of
aesthetic
which
is
a
general
science
embracing
both
its
laws
are
diffused
among
all
the
arts
like
the
mariner
star
and
they
must
be
always
referred
to
in
all
cases
for
they
are
universal
not
empirical
or
merely
inductive
regula
pejor
est
quam
aesthetic
must
not
be
confounded
with
psychology
which
supplies
only
suppositions
aesthetic
is
an
independent
science
which
gives
the
rules
for
knowing
sensibly
and
is
occupied
with
the
perfection
of
sensible
knowledge
which
is
beauty
its
contrary
is
ugliness
the
beauty
of
objects
and
of
matter
must
be
excluded
from
the
beauty
of
sensible
knowledge
because
beautiful
objects
can
be
badly
thought
and
ugly
objects
beautifully
thought
poetic
representations
are
those
which
are
confused
or
imaginative
distinction
and
intellectuality
are
not
poetic
the
greater
the
determination
the
greater
the
poetry
individuals
absolutely
determined
are
very
poetical
as
are
images
or
fancies
and
everything
which
refers
to
feeling
the
judgment
of
sensible
and
imaginative
representations
is
taste
such
are
in
brief
the
truths
which
baumgarten
stated
in
his
and
further
developed
and
exemplified
in
his
close
study
of
the
two
works
leads
to
the
conviction
that
baumgarten
did
not
succeed
in
freeing
himself
from
the
unity
of
the
leibnitzian
monadology
he
obtained
from
leibnitz
his
conception
of
the
poetic
as
consisting
of
the
confused
but
german
critics
are
wrong
in
believing
that
he
attributed
to
it
a
positive
not
a
negative
quality
had
he
really
done
this
he
would
have
broken
at
a
blow
the
unity
of
the
leibnitzian
monad
and
conquered
the
science
of
aesthetic
this
giant
step
he
did
not
take
he
failed
to
banish
the
contradictions
of
leibnitz
and
of
the
other
intellectualists
to
posit
a
did
not
suffice
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
it
against
the
of
leibnitz
and
to
proclaim
its
independence
of
all
intellectualism
aesthetic
truths
for
baumgarten
were
those
which
did
not
seem
altogether
false
or
altogether
true
in
fact
the
verisimilar
if
it
were
objected
to
baumgarten
that
one
should
not
occupy
oneself
with
what
like
poetry
he
defines
as
confused
and
obscure
he
would
reply
that
confusion
is
a
condition
of
finding
the
truth
that
we
do
not
pass
at
once
from
night
to
dawn
thus
he
did
not
surpass
the
thought
of
leibnitz
in
this
respect
poor
baumgarten
was
always
in
suspense
lest
he
should
be
held
to
occupy
himself
with
things
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
how
can
you
a
professor
of
philosophy
dare
to
praise
lying
and
the
mixture
of
truth
and
falsehood
he
imagined
that
some
such
reproach
might
be
addressed
to
him
on
account
of
his
purely
philosophical
speculations
and
true
enough
he
actually
received
a
criticism
of
his
theory
in
which
it
was
argued
that
if
poetry
consisted
of
sensual
perfection
then
it
was
a
bad
thing
for
mankind
baumgarten
contemptuously
replied
that
he
had
not
the
time
to
argue
with
those
capable
of
confounding
his
perfecta
with
an
perfecte
omnino
the
fact
about
baumgarten
is
that
apart
from
baptizing
the
new
science
aesthetic
and
apart
from
his
first
definitions
he
does
not
stray
far
from
the
old
ruts
of
scholastic
thought
the
excellent
baumgarten
with
all
his
ardour
and
all
his
convictions
is
a
sympathetic
and
interesting
figure
in
the
history
of
aesthetic
not
yet
formed
but
in
process
of
formation
the
revolutionary
who
set
aside
the
old
definitions
of
aesthetic
and
for
the
first
time
revealed
the
true
nature
of
art
and
poetry
is
the
italian
giambattista
vico
what
were
the
ideas
developed
by
vico
in
his
they
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
solution
of
the
problem
posed
by
plato
attempted
in
vain
by
aristotle
again
posed
and
again
unsolved
at
the
renaissance
is
poetry
a
rational
or
an
irrational
thing
is
it
spiritual
or
animal
if
it
be
spiritual
what
is
its
true
nature
and
in
what
way
does
it
differ
from
art
and
science
plato
we
know
banished
poetry
to
the
inferior
region
of
the
soul
among
the
animal
spirits
vico
on
the
contrary
raises
up
poetry
and
makes
of
it
a
period
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
since
vico
is
an
ideal
history
whose
periods
are
not
concerned
with
contingent
facts
but
with
spiritual
forms
he
makes
of
it
a
moment
of
the
ideal
history
of
the
spirit
a
form
of
knowledge
poetry
comes
before
the
intellect
but
feeling
plato
had
it
with
feeling
and
for
that
reason
banished
it
from
his
republic
men
says
vico
before
observing
then
they
observe
with
perturbation
of
the
soul
finally
they
reflect
with
the
pure
intellect
he
goes
on
to
say
that
poetry
being
composed
of
passion
and
of
feeling
the
nearer
it
approaches
to
the
the
more
it
is
while
exactly
the
reverse
is
true
of
philosophy
imagination
is
independent
and
autonomous
as
regards
the
intellect
not
only
does
the
intellect
fail
of
perfection
but
all
it
can
do
is
to
destroy
it
the
studies
of
poetry
and
metaphysic
are
poets
are
the
feeling
philosophers
the
intellect
of
the
human
race
the
weaker
the
reason
the
stronger
the
imagination
philosophy
he
says
deals
with
abstract
thought
or
universals
poetry
with
the
particular
painters
and
poets
differ
only
in
their
material
homer
and
the
great
poets
appear
in
barbaric
times
dante
for
instance
appeared
in
the
renewed
barbarism
of
italy
the
poetic
ages
preceded
the
philosophical
and
poetry
is
the
father
of
prose
by
necessity
of
nature
not
by
the
caprice
of
pleasure
fables
or
imaginary
universals
were
conceived
before
reasoned
or
philosophical
universals
to
homer
says
vico
belongs
wisdom
but
only
poetic
wisdom
his
beauties
are
not
those
of
a
spirit
softened
and
civilized
by
any
philosophy
if
any
one
make
poetry
in
epochs
of
reflexion
he
becomes
a
child
again
he
does
not
reflect
with
his
intellect
but
follows
his
fancy
and
dwells
upon
particulars
if
the
true
poet
make
use
of
philosophic
ideas
he
only
does
so
that
he
may
change
logic
into
imagination
here
we
have
a
profound
statement
of
the
line
of
demarcation
between
science
and
art
can
not
be
confused
his
statement
of
the
difference
between
poetry
and
history
is
a
trifle
less
clear
he
explains
why
to
aristotle
poetry
seemed
more
philosophical
than
history
and
at
the
same
time
he
refutes
error
that
poetry
deals
with
the
universal
history
with
the
particular
poetry
equals
science
not
because
it
is
occupied
with
the
intellectual
concept
but
because
like
science
it
is
ideal
a
good
poetical
fable
must
be
all
ideal
with
the
idea
the
poet
gives
their
being
to
things
which
are
without
it
poetry
is
all
fantastic
as
being
the
art
of
painting
the
idea
not
icastic
like
the
art
of
painting
portraits
that
is
why
poets
like
painters
are
called
divine
because
in
that
respect
they
resemble
god
the
creator
vico
ends
by
identifying
poetry
and
history
the
difference
between
them
is
posterior
and
accidental
but
as
it
is
impossible
to
impart
false
ideas
because
the
false
consists
of
a
vicious
combination
of
ideas
so
it
is
impossible
to
impart
a
tradition
which
though
it
be
false
has
not
at
first
contained
some
element
of
truth
thus
mythology
appears
for
the
first
time
not
as
the
invention
of
an
individual
but
as
the
spontaneous
vision
of
the
truth
as
it
appears
to
primitive
man
poetry
and
language
are
for
vico
substantially
identical
he
finds
in
the
origins
of
poetry
the
origins
of
languages
and
letters
he
believed
that
the
first
languages
consisted
in
mute
acts
or
acts
accompanied
by
bodies
which
had
natural
relations
to
the
ideas
that
it
was
desired
to
signify
with
great
cleverness
he
compared
these
pictured
languages
to
heraldic
arms
and
devices
and
to
hieroglyphs
he
observed
that
during
the
barbarism
of
the
middle
age
the
mute
language
of
signs
must
return
and
we
find
it
in
the
heraldry
and
blazonry
of
that
epoch
hence
come
three
kinds
of
languages
divine
silent
languages
heroic
emblematic
languages
and
speech
languages
formal
logic
could
never
satisfy
a
man
with
such
revolutionary
ideas
upon
poetry
and
language
he
describes
the
aristotelian
syllogism
as
a
method
which
explains
universals
in
their
particulars
rather
than
unites
particulars
to
obtain
universals
looks
upon
zeno
and
the
sorites
as
a
means
of
subtilizing
rather
than
sharpening
the
intelligence
and
concludes
that
bacon
is
a
great
philosopher
when
he
advocates
and
illustrates
which
has
been
followed
by
the
english
to
the
great
advantage
of
experimental
philosophy
hence
he
proceeds
to
criticize
mathematics
which
had
hitherto
always
been
looked
upon
as
the
type
of
the
vico
is
indeed
a
revolutionary
a
pioneer
he
knows
very
well
that
he
is
in
direct
opposition
to
all
that
has
been
thought
before
about
poetry
my
new
principles
of
poetry
upset
all
that
first
plato
and
then
aristotle
have
said
about
the
origin
of
poetry
all
that
has
been
said
by
the
patrizzi
by
the
scaligers
and
by
the
castelvetri
i
have
discovered
that
it
was
through
lack
of
human
reason
that
poetry
was
born
so
sublime
that
neither
the
arts
nor
the
poetics
nor
the
critiques
could
cause
another
equal
to
it
to
be
born
i
say
equal
and
not
superior
he
goes
as
far
as
to
express
shame
at
having
to
report
the
stupidities
of
great
philosophers
upon
the
origin
of
song
and
verse
he
shows
his
dislike
for
the
cartesian
philosophy
and
its
tendency
to
dry
up
the
imagination
by
denying
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
which
come
to
it
from
the
body
and
talks
of
his
own
time
as
of
one
which
freezes
all
the
generous
quality
of
the
best
poetry
and
thus
precludes
it
from
being
understood
as
regards
grammatical
forms
vico
may
be
described
as
an
adherent
of
the
great
reaction
of
the
renaissance
against
scholastic
verbalism
and
formalism
this
reaction
brought
back
as
a
value
the
experience
of
feeling
and
afterwards
with
romanticism
gave
its
right
place
to
the
imagination
vico
in
his
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
draw
attention
to
the
imagination
although
he
makes
many
luminous
remarks
on
history
and
the
development
of
poetry
among
the
greeks
his
work
is
not
really
a
history
but
a
science
of
the
spirit
or
of
the
ideal
it
is
not
the
ethical
logical
or
economic
moment
of
humanity
which
interests
him
but
the
moment
discovered
the
creative
and
it
may
almost
be
said
of
the
of
vico
that
it
is
aesthetic
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
of
a
new
mode
of
knowledge
this
was
the
contribution
of
the
genius
of
vico
to
the
progress
of
humanity
he
showed
aesthetic
to
be
an
autonomous
activity
it
remained
to
distinguish
the
science
of
the
spirit
from
history
the
modifications
of
the
human
spirit
from
the
historic
vicissitudes
of
peoples
aesthetic
from
homeric
civilization
but
although
goethe
herder
and
wolf
were
acquainted
with
the
the
importance
of
this
wonderful
book
did
not
at
first
dawn
upon
the
world
wolf
in
his
prolegomena
to
homer
thought
that
he
was
dealing
merely
with
an
ingenious
speculator
on
homeric
themes
he
did
not
realize
that
the
intellectual
stature
of
vico
far
surpassed
that
of
the
most
able
philologists
the
fortunes
of
aesthetic
after
vico
were
very
various
and
the
list
of
aestheticians
who
fell
back
into
the
old
pedagogic
definition
or
elaborated
the
mistakes
of
baumgarten
is
very
long
yet
with
heydenreich
in
germany
and
sulzer
in
switzerland
we
find
that
the
truths
contained
in
baumgarten
have
begun
to
bear
fruit
herder
was
more
important
than
these
and
he
placed
baumgarten
upon
a
pedestal
though
criticizing
his
pretension
of
creating
an
pulchre
instead
of
a
simple
de
pulchro
et
pulchris
philosophice
herder
admitted
baumgarten
definition
of
poetry
as
sensitiva
perfect
sensitived
speech
and
this
is
the
best
definition
of
poetry
that
has
ever
been
it
touches
the
real
essence
of
poetry
and
opens
to
thought
the
whole
of
the
philosophy
of
the
beautiful
herder
although
he
does
not
cite
vico
upon
aesthetic
questions
yet
praises
him
as
a
philosopher
his
remarks
about
poetry
as
the
maternal
language
of
humanity
as
the
garden
is
more
ancient
than
the
cultivated
field
painting
than
writing
song
than
declamation
exchange
than
commerce
are
replete
with
the
spirit
of
the
italian
philosopher
but
despite
similar
happy
phrases
herder
is
philosophically
the
inferior
of
the
great
italian
he
is
a
firm
believer
in
the
leibnitzian
law
of
continuity
and
does
not
surpass
the
conclusions
of
baumgarten
herder
and
his
friend
hamann
did
good
service
as
regards
the
philosophy
of
language
the
french
encyclopaedists
rousseau
and
many
others
of
this
period
were
none
of
them
able
to
get
free
of
the
idea
that
a
word
is
either
a
natural
mechanical
fact
or
a
sign
attached
to
a
thought
the
only
way
out
of
this
difficulty
is
to
look
upon
the
imagination
as
itself
active
and
expressive
in
and
language
as
the
language
of
not
of
the
intelligence
herder
talks
of
language
as
an
understanding
of
the
soul
with
itself
thus
language
begins
to
appear
not
as
an
arbitrary
invention
or
a
mechanical
fact
but
as
a
primitive
affirmation
of
human
activity
as
a
but
all
unconscious
of
the
discoveries
of
vico
the
great
mass
of
eighteenth
century
writers
try
their
hands
at
every
sort
of
solution
the
abbé
batteux
published
in
réduits
a
un
seul
which
is
a
perfect
little
bouquet
of
contradictions
the
abbé
finds
himself
confronted
with
difficulties
at
every
turn
but
with
un
peu
on
se
tire
de
tout
and
when
for
instance
he
has
to
explain
artistic
enjoyment
of
things
displeasing
he
remarks
that
the
imitation
never
being
perfect
like
reality
the
horror
caused
by
reality
disappears
but
the
french
were
equalled
and
indeed
surpassed
by
the
english
in
their
amateur
aesthetics
the
painter
hogarth
was
one
day
reading
in
italian
a
speech
about
the
beauty
of
certain
figures
attributed
to
michael
angelo
this
led
him
to
imagine
that
the
figurative
arts
depend
upon
a
principle
which
consists
of
conforming
to
a
given
line
in
he
produced
a
serpentine
line
as
frontispiece
of
his
collection
of
engravings
which
he
described
as
the
line
of
beauty
thus
he
succeeded
in
exciting
universal
curiosity
which
he
proceeded
to
satisfy
with
his
analysis
of
beauty
here
he
begins
by
rightly
combating
the
error
of
judging
paintings
by
their
subject
and
by
the
degree
of
their
imitation
instead
of
by
their
form
which
is
the
essential
in
art
he
gives
his
definition
of
form
and
afterwards
proceeds
to
describe
the
waving
lines
which
are
beautiful
and
those
which
are
not
and
maintains
that
among
them
all
there
is
but
one
that
is
really
worthy
to
be
called
the
line
of
beauty
and
one
definite

the
line

the
pig

they

burke
with
a
like
assurance
in
his
examples
was
equally
devoid
of
certainty
in
his
general
principles
he
declares
that
the
natural
properties
of
an
object
cause
pleasure
or
pain
to
the
imagination
but
that
the
latter
also
procures
pleasure
from
their
resemblance
to
the
original
he
does
not
speak
further
of
the
second
of
these
but
gives
a
long
list
of
the
natural
properties
of
the
sensible
beautiful
object
having
concluded
his
list
he
remarks
that
these
are
in
his
opinion
the
qualities
upon
which
beauty
depends
and
which
are
the
least
liable
to
caprice
and
confusion
but
comparative
smallness
delicate
structure
colouring
vivid
but
not
too
much
so
are
all
mere
empirical
observations
of
no
more
value
than
those
of
hogarth
with
whom
burke
must
be
classed
as
an
aesthetician
their
works
are
spoken
of
as
classics
classics
indeed
they
are
but
of
the
sort
that
arrive
at
no
conclusion
henry
home
lord
kaimes
is
on
a
level
a
trifle
above
the
two
just
mentioned
he
seeks
the
true
principles
of
the
in
order
to
transform
criticism
into
a
rational
science
he
selects
facts
and
experience
for
this
purpose
but
in
his
definition
of
beauty
which
he
divides
into
two
parts
relative
and
intrinsic
he
is
unable
to
explain
the
latter
save
by
a
final
cause
which
he
finds
in
the
almighty
such
theories
as
the
three
above
mentioned
defy
classification
because
they
are
not
composed
by
any
scientific
method
their
authors
pass
from
physiological
sensualism
to
moralism
from
imitation
of
nature
to
finalism
and
to
transcendental
mysticism
without
consciousness
of
the
incongruity
of
their
theses
at
variance
each
with
itself
the
german
ernest
platner
at
any
rate
did
not
suffer
from
a
like
confusion
of
thought
he
developed
his
researches
on
the
lines
of
hogarth
but
was
only
able
to
discover
a
prolongation
of
sexual
pleasure
in
aesthetic
facts
where
he
exclaims
is
there
any
beauty
that
does
not
come
from
the
feminine
figure
the
centre
of
all
beauty
the
undulating
line
is
beautiful
because
it
is
found
in
the
body
of
woman
essentially
feminine
movements
are
beautiful
the
notes
of
music
are
beautiful
when
they
melt
into
one
another
a
poem
is
beautiful
when
one
thought
embraces
another
with
lightness
and
facility
french
sensualism
shows
itself
quite
incapable
of
understanding
aesthetic
production
and
the
associationism
of
david
hume
is
not
more
fortunate
in
this
respect
the
dutchman
hemsterhuis
developed
an
ingenious
theory
mingling
mystical
and
sensualist
theory
with
some
just
remarks
which
afterwards
in
the
hands
of
jacobi
became
sentimentalism
hemsterhuis
believed
beauty
to
be
a
phenomenon
arising
from
the
meeting
by
the
sentimentalism
which
gives
multiplicity
with
the
internal
sense
which
tends
to
unity
consequently
the
beautiful
will
be
that
which
presents
the
greatest
number
of
ideas
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
to
man
is
denied
supreme
unity
but
here
he
finds
approximative
unity
hence
the
joy
arising
from
the
beautiful
which
has
some
analogy
with
the
joy
of
love
with
winckelmann
platonism
or
was
vigorously
renewed
the
creator
of
the
history
of
the
figurative
arts
saw
in
the
divine
indifference
and
more
than
human
elevation
of
the
works
of
greek
sculpture
a
beauty
which
had
descended
from
the
seventh
heaven
and
become
incarnate
in
them
mendelssohn
the
follower
of
baumgarten
had
denied
beauty
to
god
winckelmann
the
neoplatonician
gave
it
back
to
him
he
holds
that
perfect
beauty
is
to
be
found
only
in
god
the
conception
of
human
beauty
becomes
the
more
perfect
in
proportion
as
it
can
be
thought
as
in
agreement
with
the
supreme
being
who
is
distinguished
from
matter
by
his
unity
and
indivisibility
to
the
other
characteristics
of
supreme
beauty
winckelmann
adds
the
absence
of
any
sort
of
signification
unbezeichnung
lines
and
dots
can
not
explain
beauty
for
it
is
not
they
alone
which
form
it
its
form
is
not
proper
to
any
definite
person
it
expresses
no
sentiment
no
feeling
of
passion
for
these
break
up
unity
and
diminish
or
obscure
beauty
according
to
winckelmann
beauty
must
be
like
a
drop
of
pure
water
taken
from
the
spring
which
is
the
more
healthy
the
less
it
has
of
taste
because
it
is
purified
of
all
foreign
elements
a
special
faculty
is
required
to
appreciate
this
beauty
which
winckelmann
is
inclined
to
call
intelligence
or
a
delicate
internal
sense
free
of
all
instinctive
passions
of
pleasure
and
of
friendship
since
it
becomes
a
question
of
perceiving
something
immaterial
winckelmann
banishes
colour
to
a
secondary
place
true
beauty
he
says
is
that
of
form
a
word
which
describes
lines
and
contours
as
though
lines
and
contours
could
not
also
be
perceived
by
the
senses
or
could
appear
to
the
eye
without
any
colour
it
is
the
destiny
of
error
to
be
obliged
to
contradict
itself
when
it
does
not
decide
to
dwell
in
a
brief
aphorism
in
order
to
live
as
well
as
may
be
with
facts
and
concrete
problems
the
history
of
winckelmann
dealt
with
historic
concrete
facts
with
which
it
was
necessary
to
reconcile
the
idea
of
a
supreme
beauty
his
admission
of
the
contours
of
lines
and
his
secondary
admission
of
colours
is
a
compromise
he
makes
another
with
regard
to
the
principle
of
expression
since
there
is
no
intermediary
between
pain
and
pleasure
in
human
nature
and
since
a
human
being
without
these
feelings
is
inconceivable
we
must
place
the
human
figure
in
a
moment
of
action
and
of
passion
which
is
what
is
termed
expression
in
art
so
winckelmann
studied
expression
after
beauty
he
makes
a
third
compromise
between
his
one
indivisible
supreme
and
constant
beauty
and
individual
beauties
winckelmann
preferred
the
male
to
the
female
body
as
the
most
complete
incarnation
of
supreme
beauty
but
he
was
not
able
to
shut
his
eyes
to
the
indisputable
fact
that
there
also
exist
beautiful
bodies
of
women
and
even
of
animals
raphael
mengs
the
painter
was
an
intimate
friend
of
winckelmann
and
associated
himself
with
him
in
his
search
for
a
true
definition
of
the
beautiful
his
ideas
were
generally
in
accordance
with
those
of
winckelmann
he
defines
beauty
as
the
visible
idea
of
perfection
which
is
to
perfection
what
the
visible
is
to
the
mathematical
point
he
falls
under
the
influence
of
the
argument
from
design
the
creator
has
ordained
the
multiplicity
of
beauties
things
are
beautiful
according
to
our
ideas
of
them
and
these
ideas
come
from
the
creator
thus
each
beautiful
thing
has
its
own
type
and
a
child
would
appear
ugly
if
it
resembled
a
man
he
adds
to
his
remarks
in
this
sense
as
the
diamond
is
alone
perfect
among
stones
gold
among
metals
and
man
among
living
creatures
so
there
is
distinction
in
each
species
and
but
little
is
perfect
in
his
of
he
looks
upon
beauty
as
an
intermediate
disposition
which
contains
a
part
of
perfection
and
a
part
of
the
agreeable
and
forms
a
which
differs
from
the
other
two
and
deserves
a
special
name
he
names
four
sources
of
the
art
of
painting
beauty
significant
or
expressive
character
harmony
and
colouring
the
first
of
these
he
finds
among
the
ancients
the
second
with
raphael
the
third
with
correggio
the
fourth
with
titian
mengs
does
not
succeed
in
rising
above
this
empiricism
of
the
studio
save
to
declaim
about
the
beauty
of
nature
virtue
forms
and
proportions
and
indeed
everything
including
the
first
cause
which
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
name
of
lessing
is
well
known
to
all
concerned
with
art
problems
the
ideas
of
winckelmann
reappear
in
lessing
with
less
of
a
metaphysical
tinge
for
lessing
the
end
of
art
is
the
pleasing
and
since
this
is
a
superfluous
thing
he
thought
that
the
legislator
should
not
allow
to
art
the
liberty
indispensable
to
science
which
seeks
the
truth
necessary
to
the
soul
for
the
greeks
painting
was
as
it
should
always
be
imitation
of
beautiful
bodies
everything
disagreeable
or
should
be
excluded
from
painting
painting
as
clever
imitation
may
imitate
deformity
painting
as
a
fine
art
does
not
permit
this
he
was
more
inclined
to
admit
deformity
in
poetry
as
there
it
is
less
shocking
and
the
poet
can
make
use
of
it
to
produce
in
us
certain
feelings
such
as
the
ridiculous
or
the
terrible
in
his
lessing
followed
the
peripatetics
and
believed
that
the
rules
of
aristotle
were
as
absolute
as
the
theorems
of
euclid
his
polemic
against
the
french
school
is
chiefly
directed
to
claiming
a
place
in
poetry
for
the
verisimilar
as
against
absolute
historical
exactitude
he
held
the
universal
to
be
a
sort
of
mean
of
what
appears
in
the
individual
the
catharsis
was
in
his
view
a
transformation
of
the
passions
into
virtuous
dispositions
and
he
held
the
duty
of
poetry
to
be
inspiration
of
the
love
of
virtue
he
followed
winckelmann
in
believing
that
the
expression
of
physical
beauty
was
the
supreme
object
of
painting
this
beauty
exists
only
as
an
ideal
which
finds
its
highest
expression
in
man
animals
possess
it
to
a
slighter
extent
vegetable
and
inanimate
nature
not
at
all
those
mistaken
enough
to
occupy
themselves
with
depicting
the
latter
are
imitating
beauties
deprived
of
all
ideal
they
work
only
with
eye
and
hand
genius
has
little
if
any
share
in
their
productions
lessing
found
the
physical
ideal
to
reside
chiefly
in
form
but
also
in
the
ideal
of
colour
and
in
permanent
expression
mere
colouring
and
transitory
expression
were
for
him
without
ideal
because
nature
has
not
imposed
upon
herself
anything
definite
as
regards
them
at
bottom
he
does
not
care
for
colouring
finding
in
the
pen
drawings
of
artists
a
life
a
liberty
a
delicacy
lacking
to
their
pictures
he
asks
whether
even
the
most
wonderful
colouring
can
make
up
for
such
a
loss
and
whether
it
be
not
desirable
that
the
art
of
had
never
been
invented
this
ideal
beauty
wonderfully
constructed
from
divine
quintessence
and
subtle
pen
and
brush
strokes
this
academic
mystery
had
great
success
in
italy
it
was
much
discussed
in
the
environment
of
mengs
and
of
winckelmann
who
were
working
there
the
first
counterblast
to
their
aesthetic
came
from
an
italian
named
spalletti
and
took
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed
to
mengs
he
represents
the
as
the
true
principle
of
art
the
pleasure
obtained
from
beauty
is
intellectual
and
truth
is
its
object
when
the
soul
meets
with
what
is
characteristic
and
what
really
suits
the
object
to
be
represented
the
work
is
held
to
be
beautiful
a
man
with
a
woman
face
is
ugly
harmony
order
variety
proportion
these
are
elements
of
beauty
and
man
enjoys
the
widening
of
his
knowledge
before
disagreeable
things
characteristically
represented
spalletti
defines
beauty
as
that
modification
inherent
to
the
object
observed
which
presents
it
as
it
should
appear
with
an
infallible
characteristic
thus
the
aristotelian
thesis
found
a
supporter
in
italy
some
years
before
any
protestation
was
heard
in
germany
louis
hirt
the
historian
of
art
observed
that
ancient
monuments
represented
all
sorts
of
forms
from
the
most
beautiful
and
sublime
to
the
most
ugly
and
most
common
he
therefore
denied
that
ideal
beauty
was
the
principle
of
art
and
for
it
substituted
the
applicable
equally
to
gods
heroes
and
animals
wolfgang
goethe
in
forgetting
the
juvenile
period
during
which
he
had
dared
to
raise
a
hymn
to
gothic
architecture
now
began
seriously
to
seek
a
middle
term
between
beauty
and
expression
he
believed
that
he
had
found
it
in
certain
characteristic
contents
presenting
to
the
artist
beautiful
shapes
which
the
artist
would
then
develop
and
reduce
to
perfect
beauty
thus
for
goethe
at
this
period
the
characteristic
was
simply
the
or
framework
from
which
the
beautiful
arose
through
the
power
of
the
artist
but
these
writers
mentioned
after
vico
are
not
true
philosophers
winckelmann
mengs
hogarth
lessing
and
goethe
are
great
in
other
ways
meier
called
himself
a
historian
of
art
but
he
was
inferior
both
to
herder
and
to
hamann
from
vico
to
emmanuel
kant
european
thought
is
without
a
name
of
great
importance
as
regards
this
subject
kant
took
up
the
problem
where
vico
had
left
it
not
in
the
historical
but
in
the
ideal
sense
he
resembled
the
italian
philosopher
in
the
gravity
and
the
tenacity
of
his
studies
in
aesthetic
but
he
was
far
less
happy
in
his
solutions
which
did
not
attain
to
the
truth
and
to
which
he
did
not
succeed
in
giving
the
necessary
unity
and
systematization
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
kant
is
here
criticized
solely
as
an
aesthetician
his
other
conclusions
do
not
enter
directly
into
the
discussion
what
was
kant
idea
of
art
the
answer
is
the
same
in
substance
as
baumgarten
this
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
remember
his
sustained
polemic
against
wolf
and
the
conception
of
beauty
as
confused
perception
but
kant
always
thought
highly
of
baumgarten
he
calls
him
that
excellent
analyst
in
the
of
pure
and
he
used
baumgarten
text
for
his
university
lectures
on
metaphysic
kant
looked
upon
logic
and
aesthetic
as
cognate
studies
and
in
his
scheme
of
studies
for
and
in
the
of
pure
he
proposes
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
critique
of
taste
that
is
to
say
aesthetic
since
the
study
of
the
one
is
useful
for
the
other
and
they
are
mutually
illuminative
he
followed
meier
in
his
distinctions
between
logical
and
aesthetic
truth
he
even
quoted
the
instance
of
the
young
girl
whose
face
when
distinctly
seen
with
a
microscope
is
no
longer
beautiful
it
is
true
aesthetically
he
said
that
when
a
man
is
dead
he
can
not
come
to
life
although
this
be
opposed
both
to
logical
and
to
moral
truth
it
is
aesthetically
true
that
the
sun
plunges
into
the
sea
although
that
is
not
true
logically
or
objectively
no
one
even
among
the
greatest
can
yet
tell
to
what
extent
logical
truth
should
mingle
with
aesthetic
truth
kant
believed
that
logical
truth
must
wear
the
habit
of
aesthetic
in
order
to
become
this
habit
he
thought
was
discarded
only
by
the
rational
sciences
which
tend
to
depth
aesthetic
certainly
is
subjective
it
is
satisfied
with
authority
or
with
an
appeal
to
great
men
we
are
so
feeble
that
aesthetic
must
eke
out
our
thoughts
aesthetic
is
a
vehicle
of
logic
but
there
are
logical
truths
which
are
not
aesthetic
we
must
exclude
from
philosophy
exclamations
and
other
emotions
which
belong
to
aesthetic
truth
for
kant
poetry
is
the
harmonious
play
of
thought
and
sensation
differing
from
eloquence
because
in
poetry
thoughts
are
fitted
to
suggestions
in
eloquence
the
reverse
is
true
poetry
should
make
virtue
and
intellect
visible
as
was
done
by
pope
in
his
on
elsewhere
he
says
frankly
that
logical
perfection
is
the
foundation
of
all
the
rest
the
confirmation
of
this
is
found
in
his
of
which
schelling
looked
upon
as
the
most
important
of
the
three
and
which
hegel
and
other
metaphysical
idealists
always
especially
esteemed
for
kant
art
was
always
a
sensible
and
imaged
covering
for
an
intellectual
concept
he
did
not
look
upon
art
as
pure
beauty
without
a
concept
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
beauty
adherent
and
fixed
about
a
concept
the
work
of
genius
contains
two
elements
imagination
and
intelligence
to
these
must
be
added
taste
which
combines
the
two
art
may
even
represent
the
ugly
in
nature
for
artistic
beauty
is
not
a
beautiful
thing
but
a
beautiful
representation
of
a
thing
but
this
representation
of
the
ugly
has
its
limits
in
the
arts
here
kant
remembers
lessing
and
winckelmann
and
an
absolute
limit
in
the
disgusting
and
the
repugnant
which
kills
the
representation
itself
he
believes
that
there
may
be
artistic
productions
without
a
concept
such
as
are
flowers
in
nature
and
these
would
be
ornaments
to
frameworks
music
without
words
but
since
they
represent
nothing
reducible
to
a
definite
concept
they
must
be
classed
like
flowers
with
free
beauties
this
would
certainly
seem
to
exclude
them
from
aesthetic
which
according
to
kant
should
combine
imagination
and
intelligence
kant
is
shut
in
with
intellectualist
barriers
a
complete
definition
of
the
is
to
his
system
he
does
not
admit
that
the
imagination
belongs
to
the
powers
of
the
mind
he
relegates
it
to
the
facts
of
sensation
he
is
aware
of
the
reproductive
and
combinative
imagination
but
he
does
not
recognize
which
is
the
true
productive
imagination
yet
kant
was
aware
that
there
exists
an
activity
other
than
the
intellective
intuition
is
referred
to
by
him
as
preceding
intellective
activity
and
differing
from
sensation
he
does
not
speak
of
it
however
in
his
critique
of
art
but
in
the
first
section
of
the
of
pure
sensations
do
not
enter
the
mind
until
it
has
given
them
this
is
neither
sensation
nor
intelligence
it
is
the
sum
of
the
principles
of
sensibility
he
speaks
thus
there
must
then
exist
a
science
that
forms
the
first
part
of
the
transcendental
doctrine
of
the
elements
distinct
from
that
which
contains
the
principles
of
pure
thought
and
is
called
transcendental
logic
what
does
he
call
this
new
science
he
calls
it
and
refuses
to
allow
the
term
to
be
used
for
the
critique
of
taste
which
could
never
become
a
science
but
although
he
thus
states
so
clearly
the
necessity
of
a
science
of
the
form
of
the
sensations
that
is
of
kant
here
appears
to
fall
into
grave
error
this
arises
from
inexact
of
the
of
the
aesthetic
faculty
or
of
which
as
we
now
know
is
pure
intuition
he
conceives
the
form
of
sensibility
to
be
reducible
to
the
categories
of
space
and
benedetto
croce
has
shown
that
space
and
time
are
far
from
being
categories
or
functions
they
are
complex
posterior
formations
kant
however
looked
upon
density
colour
as
material
for
sensations
but
the
mind
only
observes
colour
or
hardness
when
it
has
given
a
form
to
its
sensations
sensations
in
so
far
as
they
are
are
the
mind
they
are
a
colour
hardness
density
are
intuitions
are
the
aesthetic
activity
in
its
rudimentary
characterizing
or
qualifying
imagination
that
is
should
therefore
the
place
occupied
by
the
study
of
space
and
in
the
of
pure
and
constitute
the
true
prologue
to
logic
had
kant
done
this
he
would
have
surpassed
leibnitz
and
baumgarten
he
would
have
equalled
vico
kant
did
not
identify
the
beautiful
with
art
he
established
what
he
called
the
four
moments
of
beauty
amounting
to
a
definition
of
it
the
two
negative
moments
are
that
is
beautiful
which
pleases
this
thesis
was
directed
against
the
sensualist
school
of
english
writers
with
whom
kant
had
for
a
time
agreed
and
that
is
beautiful
which
pleases
without
a
concept
directed
against
the
intellectualists
thus
he
affirmed
the
existence
of
a
spiritual
domain
distinct
from
that
of
organic
pleasure
of
the
useful
the
good
and
the
true
the
two
other
moments
are
that
is
beautiful
which
has
the
form
of
finality
without
the
representation
of
an
end
and
that
is
beautiful
which
is
the
object
of
universal
pleasure
what
is
this
disinterested
pleasure
that
we
experience
before
pure
colours
pure
sounds
and
flowers
benedetto
croce
replies
that
this
mysterious
domain
has
no
existence
that
the
instances
cited
represent
either
instances
of
organic
pleasure
or
are
artistic
facts
of
expression
kant
was
less
severe
with
the
neoplatonicians
than
with
the
two
schools
of
thought
above
mentioned
his
of
contains
some
curious
passages
in
one
of
which
he
gives
his
distinction
of
form
from
matter
in
music
the
melody
is
the
matter
harmony
the
form
in
a
flower
the
scent
is
the
matter
the
shape
or
configuration
the
form
in
the
other
arts
he
found
that
the
design
was
the
essential
not
what
pleases
in
sensation
but
what
is
approved
for
its
form
is
the
foundation
of
taste
in
his
pursuit
of
the
phantom
of
a
beauty
which
is
neither
that
of
art
nor
of
sensual
pleasure
exempt
alike
from
expression
and
from
enjoyment
he
became
enveloped
in
inextricable
contradictions
little
disposed
as
he
was
to
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
the
imagination
he
expressed
his
contempt
for
like
herder
and
kept
saying
and
unsaying
affirming
and
then
immediately
criticizing
his
own
affirmations
as
to
this
mysterious
beauty
the
truth
is
that
mystery
is
simply
his
own
individual
uncertainty
before
a
problem
which
he
could
not
owing
to
his
having
no
clear
idea
of
an
activity
of
sentiment
such
an
activity
represented
for
him
a
logical
contradiction
such
expressions
as
necessary
universal
pleasure
finality
without
the
idea
of
end
are
verbal
proofs
of
his
uncertainty
how
was
he
to
emerge
from
this
uncertainty
this
contradiction
he
fell
back
upon
the
concept
of
a
base
of
subjective
finality
as
the
base
of
the
judgment
of
taste
that
is
of
the
subjective
finality
of
nature
by
the
judgment
but
nothing
can
be
known
or
disclosed
to
the
object
by
means
of
this
concept
which
is
indeterminate
in
itself
and
not
adapted
for
knowledge
its
determining
reason
is
perhaps
situated
in
the
suprasensible
substratum
of
humanity
thus
beauty
becomes
a
symbol
of
morality
the
subjective
principle
alone
that
is
the
indeterminate
idea
of
the
suprasensible
in
us
can
be
indicated
as
the
sole
key
to
reveal
this
faculty
which
remains
unknown
to
us
in
its
origin
nothing
but
this
principle
can
make
that
hidden
faculty
comprehensible
kant
had
a
tendency
to
mysticism
which
this
statement
does
not
serve
to
conceal
but
it
was
a
mysticism
without
enthusiasm
a
mysticism
almost
against
the
grain
his
failure
to
penetrate
thoroughly
the
nature
of
the
aesthetic
activity
led
him
to
see
double
and
even
triple
on
several
occasions
art
being
unknown
to
him
in
its
essential
nature
he
invents
the
functions
of
and
and
terms
this
he
develops
the
theory
of
the
imaginative
beautifying
of
the
intellectual
concept
by
genius
he
is
finally
forced
to
admit
a
mysterious
power
of
feeling
intermediate
between
the
theoretic
and
the
practical
activity
this
power
is
cognoscitive
and
moral
and
indifferent
to
morality
agreeable
and
yet
detached
from
the
pleasure
of
the
senses
his
successors
hastened
to
make
use
of
this
mysterious
power
for
they
were
glad
to
be
able
to
find
some
sort
of
justification
for
their
bold
speculations
in
the
severe
philosopher
of
königsberg
in
addition
to
schelling
and
hegel
for
whom
as
has
been
said
the
of
seemed
the
most
important
of
the
three
critiques
we
must
now
mention
the
name
of
a
poet
who
showed
himself
as
great
in
philosophical
as
in
aesthetic
achievement
first
elaborated
that
portion
of
the
kantian
thought
contained
in
the
of
before
any
professional
philosopher
schiller
studied
that
sphere
of
activity
which
unites
feeling
with
reason
hegel
talks
with
admiration
of
this
artistic
genius
who
was
also
so
profoundly
philosophical
and
first
announced
the
principle
of
reconciliation
between
life
as
duty
and
reason
on
the
one
hand
and
the
life
of
the
senses
and
feeling
on
the
other
to
schiller
belongs
the
great
merit
of
having
opposed
the
subjective
idealism
of
kant
and
of
having
made
the
attempt
to
surpass
it
the
exact
relations
between
kant
and
schiller
and
the
extent
to
which
the
latter
may
have
been
influenced
by
leibnitz
and
herder
are
of
less
importance
to
the
history
of
aesthetic
than
the
fact
that
schiller
once
for
all
art
and
beauty
which
had
been
separated
by
kant
with
his
distinctions
between
adherent
and
pure
beauty
artistic
sense
must
doubtless
have
stood
him
here
in
good
stead
schiller
found
a
very
unfortunate
and
misleading
term
to
apply
to
the
aesthetic
sphere
he
called
it
the
sphere
of
spiel
he
strove
to
explain
that
by
this
he
did
not
mean
ordinary
games
nor
material
amusement
for
schiller
this
sphere
of
play
lay
intermediate
between
thought
and
feeling
necessity
in
art
gives
place
to
a
free
disposition
of
forces
mind
and
nature
matter
and
form
are
here
reconciled
the
beautiful
is
life
but
not
physiological
life
a
beautiful
statue
may
have
life
and
a
living
man
be
without
it
art
conquers
nature
with
form
the
great
artist
effaces
matter
with
form
the
less
we
are
sensible
of
the
material
in
a
work
of
art
the
greater
the
triumph
of
the
artist
the
soul
of
the
spectator
should
leave
the
magic
sphere
of
art
as
pure
and
as
perfect
as
when
it
left
the
hands
of
the
creator
the
most
frivolous
theme
should
be
so
treated
that
we
can
pass
at
once
from
it
to
the
most
rigorous
and
only
when
man
has
placed
himself
outside
the
world
and
contemplates
it
aesthetically
can
he
know
the
world
while
he
is
merely
the
passive
receiver
of
sensations
he
is
one
with
the
world
and
therefore
can
not
realize
it
art
is
indeterminism
with
the
help
of
art
man
delivers
himself
from
the
yoke
of
the
senses
and
is
at
the
same
time
free
of
any
rational
or
moral
duty
he
may
enjoy
for
a
moment
the
luxury
of
serene
contemplation
schiller
was
well
aware
that
the
moment
art
is
employed
to
teach
morals
directly
it
ceases
to
be
art
all
other
teachings
give
to
the
soul
a
special
imprint
art
alone
is
favourable
to
all
without
prejudice
owing
to
this
indifference
of
art
it
possesses
a
great
educative
power
by
opening
the
path
to
morality
without
preaching
or
persuasion
without
determining
it
produces
determinability
this
was
the
main
theme
of
the
celebrated
letters
on
the
aesthetic
education
of
man
which
schiller
wrote
to
his
patron
the
duke
of
here
and
in
his
lectures
at
the
university
of
jena
it
is
clear
that
schiller
addresses
himself
to
a
popular
audience
he
began
a
work
on
scientific
aesthetic
which
he
intended
to
entitle
kallias
but
unfortunately
died
without
completing
it
we
possess
only
a
few
fragments
contained
in
his
correspondence
with
his
friend
körner
körner
did
not
feel
satisfied
with
the
formula
of
schiller
and
asks
for
some
more
precise
and
objective
mark
of
the
beautiful
schiller
tells
him
that
he
has
found
it
but
what
he
had
found
we
shall
never
know
as
there
is
no
document
to
inform
us
the
fault
of
schiller
aesthetic
theory
was
its
lack
of
precision
his
artistic
faculty
enabled
him
to
give
unsurpassable
descriptions
of
the
catharsis
and
of
other
effects
of
art
but
he
fails
to
give
a
precise
definition
of
the
aesthetic
function
true
he
disassociates
it
from
morality
yet
admits
that
it
may
in
a
measure
be
associated
with
it
the
only
formal
activities
that
he
recognizes
are
the
moral
and
the
intellectual
and
he
denies
altogether
against
the
sensualists
that
art
can
have
anything
to
do
with
passion
or
sensuality
his
intellectual
world
consisted
only
of
the
logical
and
the
intellectual
leaving
out
the
imaginative
activity
what
is
art
for
schiller
he
admits
four
modes
of
relation
between
man
and
external
things
they
are
the
physical
the
logical
the
moral
and
the
aesthetic
he
describes
this
latter
as
a
mode
by
which
things
affect
the
whole
of
our
different
forces
without
being
a
definite
object
for
any
one
in
particular
thus
a
man
may
be
said
to
please
aesthetically
when
he
does
so
without
appealing
to
any
one
of
the
senses
directly
and
without
any
law
or
end
being
thought
of
in
connection
with
him
schiller
can
not
be
made
to
say
anything
more
definite
than
this
his
general
position
was
probably
much
like
kant
save
in
the
case
above
mentioned
where
he
made
a
happy
correction
and
he
probably
looked
upon
aesthetic
as
a
mingling
of
several
faculties
as
a
play
of
sentiment
schiller
was
faithful
to
kant
teaching
in
its
main
lines
and
his
uncertainty
was
largely
due
to
this
the
existence
of
a
uniting
form
and
matter
was
for
schiller
rather
an
ideal
conformable
to
reason
than
a
activity
it
was
supposititious
rather
than
effective
but
the
romantic
movement
in
literature
which
was
at
that
time
gaining
ground
with
its
belief
in
a
superhuman
faculty
called
imagination
in
genius
breaker
of
rules
found
no
such
need
for
restraint
modest
reserve
was
set
aside
and
with
richter
we
approach
a
mythology
of
the
imagination
many
of
his
observations
are
however
just
and
his
distinction
between
productive
and
reproductive
imagination
is
excellent
how
could
humanity
appreciate
works
of
genius
he
asks
were
it
without
some
common
measure
all
men
who
can
go
as
far
as
saying
this
is
beautiful
before
a
beautiful
thing
are
capable
of
the
latter
he
then
proceeds
to
establish
to
his
own
satisfaction
categories
of
the
imagination
leading
from
simple
talent
to
the
supreme
form
of
male
genius
in
which
all
faculties
flourish
together
a
faculty
of
faculties
the
romantic
conception
of
art
is
in
substance
that
of
idealist
german
philosophy
where
we
find
it
in
a
more
coherent
and
systematic
form
it
is
the
conception
of
schelling
solger
and
hegel
fichte
kant
first
great
pupil
can
not
be
included
with
these
for
his
view
of
aesthetic
largely
influenced
by
schiller
is
transformed
in
the
fichtian
system
to
a
moral
activity
to
a
representation
of
the
ethical
ideal
the
subjective
idealism
of
fichte
however
generated
an
aesthetic
that
of
irony
as
the
base
of
art
the
i
that
has
created
the
universe
can
also
destroy
it
the
universe
is
a
vain
appearance
smiled
at
by
the
ego
its
creator
who
surveys
it
as
an
artist
his
work
from
without
and
from
above
for
friedrich
schlegel
art
was
a
perpetual
farce
a
parody
of
itself
and
tieck
defined
irony
as
a
force
which
allows
the
poet
to
dominate
his
material
novalis
that
romantic
fichtian
dreamed
of
a
magical
idealism
an
art
of
creating
by
an
instantaneous
act
of
the
ego
but
schelling
system
of
transcendental
idealism
was
the
first
great
philosophical
affirmation
of
romanticism
and
of
conscious
reborn
in
aesthetic
schelling
has
obviously
studied
schiller
but
he
brings
to
the
problem
a
mind
more
purely
philosophical
and
a
method
more
exactly
scientific
he
even
takes
kant
to
task
for
faultiness
of
method
his
remarks
as
to
plato
position
are
curious
if
not
conclusive
he
says
that
plato
condemned
the
art
of
his
time
because
it
was
realistic
and
naturalistic
like
all
antique
art
it
exhibited
a
character
plato
judgment
would
have
been
quite
different
had
he
known
christian
art
of
which
the
character
is
schelling
held
firm
to
the
fusion
of
art
and
beauty
effected
by
schiller
but
he
combated
winckelmann
theory
of
abstract
beauty
with
its
negative
conception
of
the
characteristic
assigning
to
art
the
limits
of
the
individual
art
is
characteristic
beauty
it
is
not
the
individual
but
the
living
conception
of
the
individual
when
the
artist
recognizes
the
eternal
idea
in
an
individual
and
expresses
it
outwardly
he
transforms
the
individual
into
a
world
apart
into
a
species
into
an
eternal
idea
characteristic
beauty
is
the
fulness
of
form
which
slays
form
it
does
not
silence
passion
but
restrains
it
as
the
banks
of
a
river
the
waters
that
flow
between
them
but
do
not
overflow
schelling
is
the
criticism
of
teleological
judgment
as
stated
by
kant
in
his
third
critique
teleology
is
the
union
of
theoretic
with
practical
philosophy
but
the
system
would
not
be
complete
unless
we
could
show
the
identity
of
the
two
worlds
theoretic
and
practical
in
the
subject
itself
he
must
demonstrate
the
existence
of
an
activity
which
is
at
once
unconscious
as
nature
and
conscious
as
spirit
this
activity
we
find
in
aesthetic
which
is
therefore
the
general
organ
of
philosophy
the
keystone
of
the
whole
building
poetry
and
philosophy
alone
possess
the
world
of
the
ideal
in
which
the
real
world
vanishes
true
art
is
not
the
impression
of
the
moment
but
the
representation
of
infinite
life
it
is
transcendental
intuition
objectified
the
time
will
come
when
philosophy
will
return
to
poetry
which
was
its
source
and
on
the
new
philosophy
will
arise
a
new
mythology
philosophy
does
not
depict
real
things
but
their
ideas
so
too
art
those
same
ideas
of
which
real
things
are
as
philosophy
shows
the
imperfect
copies
reappear
in
art
objectified
as
ideas
and
therefore
in
their
perfection
art
stands
nearest
to
philosophy
which
itself
stands
nearest
to
the
idea
and
therefore
nearest
to
perfection
art
differs
from
philosophy
only
by
its
in
all
other
ways
it
is
the
ideal
world
in
its
most
complete
expression
the
three
ideas
of
truth
goodness
and
beauty
correspond
to
the
three
powers
of
the
ideal
and
of
the
real
world
beauty
is
not
the
universal
whole
which
is
truth
nor
is
it
the
only
reality
which
is
action
it
is
the
perfect
mingling
of
the
two
beauty
exists
where
the
real
or
particular
is
so
adequate
to
its
concept
that
this
infinite
thing
enters
into
the
finite
and
is
contemplated
in
the
concrete
philosophy
unites
truth
morality
and
beauty
in
what
they
possess
in
common
and
deduces
them
from
their
unique
source
which
is
god
if
philosophy
assume
the
character
of
science
and
of
truth
although
it
be
superior
to
truth
the
reason
for
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
science
and
truth
are
simply
the
formal
determination
of
philosophy
schelling
looked
upon
mythology
as
a
necessity
for
every
art
ideas
are
gods
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
reality
for
the
essence
of
each
is
equal
to
god
in
a
form
the
characteristics
of
all
gods
including
the
christian
are
limitation
and
absolute
minerva
has
wisdom
and
strength
but
lacks
womanly
tenderness
juno
has
power
and
wisdom
but
is
without
amorous
charm
which
she
borrows
with
the
girdle
of
venus
who
in
her
turn
is
without
the
wisdom
of
minerva
what
would
these
gods
become
without
their
limitations
they
would
cease
to
be
the
objects
of
fancy
fancy
is
a
faculty
apart
from
the
pure
intellect
and
from
the
reason
distinct
from
imagination
which
develops
the
products
of
art
fancy
has
intuitions
of
them
grasps
them
herself
and
herself
represents
them
fancy
is
to
imagination
as
intellectual
intuition
is
to
reason
fancy
then
is
intellectual
intuition
in
art
in
the
thought
of
schelling
fancy
the
new
or
artistic
intuition
sister
of
intellectual
intuition
came
to
dominate
alike
the
intellect
and
the
old
conception
of
the
fancy
and
the
imagination
in
a
system
for
which
reason
alone
did
not
suffice
solger
followed
schelling
and
agreed
with
him
in
finding
but
little
truth
in
the
theories
of
kant
and
especially
of
fichte
he
held
that
their
dialectic
had
failed
to
solve
the
difficulty
of
intellectual
intuition
he
too
conceived
of
fancy
as
distinct
from
imagination
and
divided
the
former
into
three
degrees
imagination
he
held
to
appertain
to
ordinary
knowledge
which
the
original
intuition
to
infinity
fancy
originates
from
the
original
antithesis
in
the
idea
and
so
operates
that
the
opposing
elements
which
are
separated
from
the
idea
become
perfectly
united
in
reality
by
means
of
fancy
we
are
able
to
understand
things
more
lofty
than
those
of
common
knowledge
and
in
them
we
recognize
the
idea
itself
as
real
in
art
fancy
is
the
faculty
of
transforming
the
idea
into
reality
for
solger
as
for
schelling
beauty
belongs
to
the
region
of
ideas
which
are
inaccessible
to
common
knowledge
art
is
nearly
allied
to
religion
for
as
religion
is
the
abyss
of
the
idea
into
which
our
consciousness
plunges
that
it
may
become
essential
so
art
and
the
beautiful
resolve
in
their
way
the
world
of
distinctions
the
universal
and
the
particular
artistic
activity
is
more
than
theoretical
it
is
practical
realized
and
perfect
and
therefore
belongs
to
practical
not
to
theoretic
philosophy
as
kant
wrongly
believed
since
art
must
touch
infinity
on
one
side
it
can
not
have
ordinary
nature
for
its
object
art
therefore
in
the
portrait
and
this
explains
why
the
ancients
generally
chose
gods
or
heroes
as
models
for
sculpture
every
deity
even
in
a
limited
and
particular
form
expresses
a
definite
modification
of
the
idea
hegel
gives
the
same
definition
of
art
as
solger
and
schelling
all
three
were
mystical
aestheticians
and
the
various
shades
of
mystical
aesthetic
presented
by
these
three
writers
are
not
of
great
interest
schelling
forced
upon
art
the
abstract
platonic
ideas
while
hegel
reduced
it
to
the
this
concrete
idea
was
for
hegel
the
first
and
lowest
of
the
three
forms
of
the
liberty
of
the
spirit
it
represented
immediate
sensible
objectified
knowledge
while
religion
filled
the
second
place
as
representative
consciousness
with
adoration
which
is
an
element
foreign
to
art
alone
the
third
place
was
of
course
occupied
by
philosophy
the
free
thought
of
the
absolute
spirit
beauty
and
truth
are
one
for
hegel
they
are
united
in
the
idea
the
beautiful
he
defined
as
sensible
appearance
of
the
some
writers
have
erroneously
believed
that
the
views
of
the
three
philosophers
above
mentioned
lead
back
to
those
of
baumgarten
but
that
is
not
correct
they
well
understood
that
art
can
not
be
made
a
medium
for
the
expression
of
philosophic
concepts
not
only
are
they
opposed
to
the
moralistic
and
intellectualistic
view
but
they
are
its
active
opponents
schelling
says
that
aesthetic
production
is
in
its
essence
absolutely
free
and
hegel
that
art
does
not
contain
the
universal
as
such
hegel
accentuated
the
character
of
art
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
we
have
seen
that
he
placed
it
with
philosophy
and
religion
in
the
sphere
of
the
absolute
spirit
but
he
does
not
allow
either
to
art
or
to
religion
any
difference
of
function
from
that
of
philosophy
which
occupies
the
highest
place
in
his
system
they
are
therefore
inferior
necessary
grades
of
the
spirit
of
what
use
are
they
of
none
whatever
or
at
best
they
merely
represent
transitory
and
historical
phases
of
human
life
thus
we
see
that
the
tendency
of
hegelianism
is
as
it
is
rationalistic
and
this
result
of
thought
was
a
strange
and
a
sad
thing
for
one
who
loved
art
so
fervently
as
hegel
our
memories
conjure
up
plato
who
also
loved
art
well
and
yet
found
himself
logically
obliged
to
banish
the
poet
from
his
ideal
republic
after
crowning
him
with
roses
but
the
german
philosopher
was
as
staunch
to
the
supposed
command
of
reason
as
the
greek
and
felt
himself
obliged
to
announce
the
death
of
art
art
he
says
occupies
a
lofty
place
in
the
human
spirit
but
not
the
most
lofty
for
it
is
limited
to
a
restricted
content
and
only
a
certain
grade
of
truth
can
be
expressed
in
art
such
are
the
hellenic
gods
who
can
be
transfused
in
the
sensible
and
appear
in
it
adequately
the
christian
conception
of
truth
is
among
those
which
can
not
be
so
expressed
the
spirit
of
the
modern
world
and
more
precisely
the
spirit
of
our
religion
and
rational
development
seem
to
have
gone
beyond
the
point
at
which
art
is
the
chief
way
of
apprehending
the
absolute
the
peculiarity
of
artistic
production
no
longer
satisfies
our
highest
needs
thought
and
reflexion
have
surpassed
art
the
beautiful
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
reason
generally
given
for
this
is
the
prevalence
of
material
and
political
interests
but
the
true
reason
is
the
inferiority
in
degree
of
art
as
compared
with
pure
thought
art
is
dead
and
philosophy
can
therefore
supply
its
complete
biography
hegel
über
amounts
therefore
to
a
funeral
oration
upon
art
romanticism
and
metaphysical
idealism
had
placed
art
sometimes
above
the
clouds
sometimes
within
them
and
believing
that
it
was
no
good
there
to
anyone
hegel
provided
a
decent
burial
nothing
perhaps
better
shows
how
well
this
fantastic
conception
of
art
suited
the
spirit
of
the
time
than
the
fact
that
even
the
adversaries
of
schelling
solger
and
hegel
either
admit
agreement
with
that
conception
or
find
themselves
involuntarily
in
agreement
with
it
while
believing
themselves
to
be
very
remote
they
too
are
mystical
aestheticians
we
all
know
with
what
virulence
arthur
schopenhauer
attacked
and
combated
schelling
hegel
and
all
the
charlatans
and
professors
who
had
divided
among
them
the
inheritance
of
kant
well
schopenhauer
theory
of
art
starts
just
like
hegel
from
the
difference
between
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
concept
which
is
the
schopenhauer
ideas
are
the
platonic
ideas
although
in
the
form
which
he
gives
to
them
they
have
a
nearer
resemblance
to
the
ideas
of
schelling
than
to
the
idea
of
hegel
schopenhauer
takes
much
trouble
to
differentiate
his
ideas
from
intellectual
concepts
he
calls
the
idea
unity
which
has
become
plurality
by
means
of
space
and
time
it
is
the
form
of
our
intuitive
apperception
the
concept
is
on
the
contrary
unity
extracted
from
plurality
by
means
of
abstraction
which
is
an
act
of
our
intellect
the
concept
may
be
called
post
the
idea
ante
the
origin
of
this
psychological
illusion
of
the
ideas
or
types
of
things
is
always
to
be
found
in
the
changing
of
the
empirical
classifications
created
for
their
own
purposes
by
the
natural
sciences
into
living
realities
thus
each
art
has
for
its
sphere
a
special
category
of
ideas
architecture
and
its
derivatives
gardening
and
strange
to
say
is
included
with
it
sculpture
and
historical
painting
and
the
higher
forms
of
sculpture
all
possess
their
special
ideas
poetry
chief
object
is
man
as
idea
music
on
the
contrary
does
not
belong
to
the
hierarchy
of
the
other
arts
schelling
had
looked
upon
music
as
expressing
the
rhythm
of
the
universe
itself
for
schopenhauer
music
does
not
express
ideas
but
the
the
analogies
between
music
and
the
world
between
fundamental
notes
and
crude
matter
between
the
scale
and
the
scale
of
species
between
melody
and
conscious
will
lead
schopenhauer
to
the
conclusion
that
music
is
not
only
an
arithmetic
as
it
appeared
to
leibnitz
but
indeed
a
metaphysic
the
occult
metaphysical
exercise
of
a
soul
not
knowing
that
it
philosophizes
for
schopenhauer
as
for
his
idealist
predecessors
art
is
beatific
it
is
the
flower
of
life
he
who
is
plunged
in
artistic
contemplation
ceases
to
be
an
individual
he
is
the
conscious
subject
pure
freed
from
will
from
pain
and
from
time
yet
in
schopenhauer
system
exist
elements
for
a
better
and
a
more
profound
treatment
of
the
problem
of
art
he
could
sometimes
show
himself
to
be
a
lucid
and
acute
analyst
for
instance
he
continually
remarks
that
the
categories
of
space
and
time
are
not
applicable
to
art
only
the
general
form
of
he
might
have
deduced
from
this
that
art
is
the
most
immediate
not
the
most
lofty
grade
of
consciousness
since
it
precedes
even
the
ordinary
perceptions
of
space
and
time
vico
had
already
observed
that
this
freeing
oneself
from
ordinary
perception
this
dwelling
in
imagination
does
not
really
mean
an
ascent
to
the
level
of
the
platonic
ideas
but
on
the
contrary
a
redescending
to
the
sphere
of
immediate
intuition
a
return
to
childhood
on
the
other
hand
schopenhauer
had
begun
to
submit
the
kantian
categories
to
impartial
criticism
and
finding
the
two
forms
of
intuition
insufficient
added
a
third
causality
he
also
drew
comparisons
between
art
and
history
and
was
more
successful
here
than
the
idealist
excogitators
of
a
philosophy
of
history
schopenhauer
rightly
saw
that
history
was
irreducible
to
concepts
that
it
is
the
contemplation
of
the
individual
and
therefore
not
a
science
having
proceeded
thus
far
he
might
have
gone
further
and
realized
that
the
material
of
history
is
always
the
particular
in
its
particularity
that
of
art
what
is
and
always
is
identical
but
he
preferred
to
execute
a
variation
on
the
general
motive
that
was
in
fashion
at
this
time
the
fashion
of
the
day
it
rules
in
philosophy
as
elsewhere
and
we
are
now
about
to
see
the
most
rigid
and
arid
of
analysts
the
leader
of
the
school
or
school
of
in
germany
in
the
nineteenth
century
plunge
headlong
into
aesthetic
mysticism
herbart
begins
his
aesthetic
by
freeing
it
from
the
discredit
attaching
to
metaphysic
and
to
psychology
he
declares
that
the
only
true
way
of
understanding
art
is
to
study
particular
examples
of
the
beautiful
and
to
note
what
they
reveal
as
to
its
essence
we
shall
now
see
what
came
of
herbart
analysis
of
these
examples
of
beauty
and
how
far
he
succeeded
in
remaining
free
of
metaphysic
for
herbart
beauty
consists
of
the
science
of
aesthetic
consists
of
an
enumeration
of
all
the
fundamental
relations
between
colours
lines
tones
thoughts
and
will
but
for
him
these
relations
are
not
empirical
or
physiological
they
can
not
therefore
be
studied
in
a
laboratory
because
thought
and
the
will
form
part
of
them
and
these
belong
as
much
to
ethics
as
to
the
external
world
but
herbart
explicitly
states
that
no
true
beauty
is
sensible
although
sensation
may
and
does
often
precede
and
follow
the
intuition
of
beauty
there
is
a
profound
distinction
between
the
beautiful
and
the
agreeable
or
pleasant
the
latter
does
not
require
a
representation
while
the
former
consists
in
representations
of
relations
which
are
immediately
followed
by
a
judgment
expressing
unconditioned
approval
thus
the
merely
pleasurable
becomes
more
and
more
indifferent
but
the
beautiful
appears
always
as
of
more
and
more
permanent
value
the
judgment
of
taste
is
universal
eternal
immutable
the
complete
representation
of
the
same
relations
always
carries
with
it
the
same
judgment
for
herbart
aesthetic
judgments
are
the
general
class
containing
the
of
ethical
judgments
the
five
ethical
ideas
of
internal
liberty
of
perfection
of
benevolence
of
equity
and
of
justice
are
five
aesthetic
ideas
or
better
they
are
aesthetic
concepts
applied
to
the
will
in
its
relations
herbart
looked
upon
art
as
a
complex
fact
composed
of
an
external
element
possessing
logical
or
psychological
value
the
content
and
of
a
true
aesthetic
element
which
is
the
form
entertainment
instruction
and
pleasure
of
all
sorts
are
mingled
with
the
beautiful
in
order
to
obtain
favour
for
the
work
in
question
the
aesthetic
judgment
calm
and
serene
in
itself
may
be
accompanied
by
all
sorts
of
psychic
emotions
foreign
to
it
but
the
content
is
always
transitory
relative
subject
to
moral
laws
and
judged
by
them
the
form
alone
is
perennial
absolute
and
free
the
true
catharsis
can
only
be
effected
by
separating
the
form
from
the
content
concrete
art
may
be
the
sum
of
two
values
the
aesthetic
fact
is
form
for
those
capable
of
penetrating
beneath
appearances
the
aesthetic
doctrines
of
herbart
and
of
kant
will
appear
very
similar
herbart
is
notable
as
insisting
in
the
manner
of
kant
on
the
distinction
between
free
and
adherent
beauty
or
adornment
as
sensuous
stimulant
on
the
existence
of
pure
beauty
object
of
necessary
and
universal
judgments
and
on
a
certain
mingling
of
ethical
with
his
aesthetic
theory
herbart
indeed
called
himself
a
kantian
but
of
the
year
aesthetic
theory
though
it
be
full
of
errors
yet
is
rich
in
fruitful
suggestions
kant
belongs
to
a
period
when
philosophy
is
still
young
and
pliant
herbart
came
later
and
is
dry
and
the
romantics
and
the
metaphysical
idealists
had
unified
the
theory
of
the
beautiful
and
of
art
herbart
restored
the
old
duality
and
mechanism
and
gave
us
an
absurd
unfruitful
form
of
mysticism
void
of
all
artistic
inspiration
herbart
may
be
said
to
have
taken
all
there
was
of
false
in
the
thought
of
kant
and
to
have
made
it
into
a
system
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
germany
is
notable
for
the
great
number
of
philosophical
theories
and
of
broached
and
rapidly
discussed
before
being
discarded
none
of
the
most
prominent
names
in
the
period
belong
to
philosophers
of
importance
though
they
made
so
much
stir
in
their
day
the
thought
of
friedrich
schleiermacher
was
obscured
and
misunderstood
amid
those
crowding
mediocrities
yet
it
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
noteworthy
of
the
period
schleiermacher
looked
upon
aesthetic
as
an
altogether
modern
form
of
thought
he
perceived
a
profound
difference
between
the
poetics
of
aristotle
not
yet
freed
from
empirical
precepts
and
the
tentative
of
baumgarten
in
the
eighteenth
century
he
praised
kant
as
having
been
the
first
to
include
aesthetic
among
the
philosophical
disciplines
he
admitted
that
with
hegel
it
had
attained
to
the
highest
pinnacle
being
connected
with
religion
and
with
philosophy
and
almost
placed
upon
their
level
but
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
absurdity
of
the
attempt
made
by
the
followers
of
baumgarten
to
construct
a
science
or
theory
of
sensuous
pleasure
he
disapproved
of
kant
view
of
taste
as
being
the
principle
of
aesthetic
of
fichte
art
as
moral
teaching
and
of
the
vague
conception
of
the
beautiful
as
the
centre
of
aesthetic
he
approved
of
schiller
marking
of
the
moment
of
spontaneity
in
productive
art
and
he
praised
schelling
for
having
drawn
attention
to
the
figurative
arts
as
being
less
liable
than
poetry
to
be
diverted
to
false
and
illusory
moralistic
ends
before
he
begins
the
study
of
the
place
due
to
the
artistic
activity
in
ethic
he
carefully
excludes
from
the
study
of
aesthetic
all
practical
rules
which
being
empirical
are
incapable
of
scientific
demonstration
for
schleiermacher
the
sphere
of
ethic
included
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
spirit
in
addition
to
morality
these
are
the
two
forms
of
human
activity
that
which
like
logic
is
the
same
in
all
men
and
is
called
activity
of
identity
and
the
activity
of
difference
or
individuality
there
are
activities
which
like
art
are
internal
or
immanent
and
individual
and
others
which
are
external
or
practical
true
work
of
art
is
the
internal
measure
is
what
differentiates
the
artist
portrayal
of
anger
on
the
stage
and
the
anger
of
a
really
angry
man
truth
is
not
sought
in
poetry
or
if
it
be
sought
there
it
is
truth
of
an
altogether
different
kind
the
truth
of
poetry
lies
in
coherent
presentation
likeness
to
a
model
does
not
compose
the
merit
of
a
picture
not
the
smallest
amount
of
knowledge
comes
from
art
which
expresses
only
the
truth
of
a
particular
consciousness
art
has
for
its
field
the
immediate
consciousness
of
self
which
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
thought
of
the
ego
this
last
is
the
consciousness
of
identity
in
the
diversity
of
moments
as
they
pass
the
immediate
consciousness
of
self
is
the
diversity
itself
of
the
moments
of
which
we
should
be
aware
for
life
is
nothing
but
the
development
of
consciousness
in
this
field
art
has
sometimes
been
confused
with
two
facts
which
accompany
it
there
these
are
sentient
consciousness
that
is
the
feelings
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
and
religion
schleiermacher
here
alludes
to
the
sensualistic
aestheticians
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
to
hegel
who
had
almost
identified
art
and
religion
he
refutes
both
points
of
view
by
pointing
out
that
sentient
pleasure
and
religious
sentiment
however
different
they
may
be
from
other
points
of
view
are
yet
both
determined
by
an
objective
fact
while
art
on
the
contrary
is
free
productivity
dream
is
the
best
parallel
and
proof
of
this
free
productivity
all
the
essential
elements
of
art
are
found
in
dream
which
is
the
result
of
free
thoughts
and
of
sensible
intuitions
consisting
simply
of
images
but
dream
as
compared
with
art
is
chaotic
when
measure
and
order
is
established
in
dream
it
becomes
art
thoughts
and
images
are
alike
essential
to
art
and
to
both
is
necessary
ponderation
reflexion
measure
and
unity
because
otherwise
every
image
would
be
confused
with
every
other
image
thus
the
moments
of
inspiration
and
of
ponderation
are
both
necessary
to
art
schleiermacher
thought
so
firm
and
lucid
up
to
this
point
begins
to
become
less
secure
with
the
discussion
of
typicity
and
of
the
extent
to
which
the
artist
should
follow
nature
he
says
that
ideal
figures
which
nature
would
give
were
she
not
impeded
by
external
obstacles
are
the
products
of
art
he
notes
that
when
the
artist
represents
something
really
given
such
as
a
portrait
or
a
landscape
he
renounces
freedom
of
production
and
adheres
to
the
real
in
the
artist
is
a
double
tendency
toward
the
perfection
of
the
type
and
toward
the
representation
of
natural
reality
he
should
not
fall
into
the
abstraction
of
the
type
nor
into
the
insignificance
of
empirical
reality
schleiermacher
feels
all
the
difficulty
of
such
a
problem
as
whether
there
be
one
or
several
ideals
of
the
human
figure
this
problem
may
be
transferred
to
the
sphere
of
art
and
we
may
ask
whether
the
poet
is
to
represent
only
the
ideal
or
whether
he
should
also
deal
with
those
obstacles
to
it
that
impede
nature
in
her
efforts
to
attain
both
views
contain
half
the
truth
to
art
belongs
the
representation
of
the
ideal
as
of
the
real
of
the
subjective
and
of
the
objective
alike
the
representation
of
the
comic
that
is
of
the
and
of
the
imperfect
ideal
belongs
to
the
domain
of
art
for
the
human
form
both
morally
and
physically
oscillates
between
the
ideal
and
caricature
he
arrives
at
a
most
important
definition
as
to
the
independence
of
art
in
respect
to
morality
the
nature
of
art
as
of
philosophic
speculation
excludes
moral
and
practical
effects
therefore
is
no
other
difference
between
works
of
art
than
their
respective
artistic
perfection
vollkommenheit
in
der
kunst
if
we
could
correctly
predicate
volitional
acts
in
respect
of
works
of
art
then
we
should
find
ourselves
admiring
only
those
works
which
stimulated
the
will
and
there
would
thus
be
established
a
difference
of
valuation
independent
of
artistic
perfection
the
true
work
of
art
depends
upon
the
degree
of
perfection
with
which
the
external
in
it
agrees
with
the
internal
schleiermacher
rightly
combats
schiller
view
that
art
is
in
any
sense
a
game
that
he
says
is
the
view
held
by
mere
men
of
business
to
whom
business
alone
is
serious
but
artistic
activity
is
universal
and
a
man
completely
deprived
of
it
unthinkable
although
the
difference
here
between
man
and
man
is
gigantic
ranging
from
the
simple
desire
to
taste
of
art
to
the
effective
tasting
of
it
and
from
this
by
infinite
gradations
to
productive
genius
the
regrettable
fact
that
schleiermacher
thought
has
reached
us
only
in
an
imperfect
form
may
account
for
certain
of
its
defects
such
as
his
failure
to
eliminate
aesthetic
classes
and
types
his
retention
of
a
certain
residue
of
abstract
formalism
his
definition
of
art
as
the
activity
of
difference
had
he
better
defined
the
moment
of
artistic
reproduction
realized
the
possibility
of
tasting
the
art
of
various
times
and
of
other
nations
and
examined
the
true
relation
of
art
to
science
he
would
have
seen
that
this
difference
is
merely
empirical
and
to
be
surmounted
he
failed
also
to
recognize
the
identity
of
the
aesthetic
activity
with
language
as
the
base
of
all
other
theoretic
activity
but
schleiermacher
merits
far
outweigh
these
defects
he
removed
from
aesthetic
its
character
he
distinguished
form
of
different
from
logical
thought
he
attributed
to
our
science
a
character
he
the
concept
of
the
beautiful
substituting
for
it
and
maintaining
the
aesthetic
equality
of
a
small
with
a
great
work
of
art
he
looked
upon
the
aesthetic
fact
as
an
exclusively
thus
schleiermacher
the
theologian
in
this
period
of
metaphysical
orgy
of
rapidly
constructed
and
as
rapidly
destroyed
systems
perceived
with
the
greatest
philosophical
acumen
what
is
really
characteristic
of
art
and
distinguished
its
properties
and
relations
even
where
he
fails
to
see
clearly
his
way
he
never
abandons
analysis
for
mere
schleiermacher
thus
exploring
the
obscure
region
of
the
or
of
the
aesthetic
fact
can
almost
be
heard
crying
out
to
his
straying
contemporaries
rhodus
hi
speculation
upon
the
origin
and
nature
of
language
was
rife
at
this
time
in
germany
many
theories
were
put
forward
among
the
most
curious
being
that
of
schelling
who
held
language
and
mythology
to
be
the
product
of
a
consciousness
allegorically
expressed
as
the
diabolic
suggestions
which
had
precipitated
the
ego
from
the
infinite
to
the
finite
even
wilhelm
von
humboldt
was
unable
to
free
himself
altogether
from
the
intellectualistic
prejudice
of
the
substantial
identity
and
the
merely
historical
and
accidental
diversity
of
logical
thought
and
language
he
speaks
of
a
language
broken
up
and
diminished
with
the
lesser
capacities
of
lesser
peoples
he
believed
that
language
is
something
standing
outside
the
individual
independent
of
him
and
capable
of
being
revived
by
use
but
there
were
two
men
in
humboldt
an
old
man
and
a
young
one
the
latter
was
always
suggesting
that
language
should
be
looked
upon
as
a
living
not
as
a
dead
thing
as
an
activity
not
as
a
word
this
duality
of
thought
sometimes
makes
his
writing
difficult
and
obscure
although
he
speaks
of
an
internal
form
of
speech
he
fails
to
identify
this
with
art
as
expression
the
reason
is
that
he
looks
upon
the
word
in
too
unilateral
a
manner
as
a
means
of
developing
logical
thought
and
his
ideas
of
aesthetic
are
too
vague
and
too
inexact
to
enable
him
to
discover
their
identity
despite
his
perception
of
the
profound
truth
that
poetry
precedes
prose
humboldt
gives
grounds
for
doubt
as
to
whether
he
had
clearly
recognized
and
firmly
grasped
the
fact
that
language
is
always
poetry
and
that
prose
science
is
a
distinction
not
of
aesthetic
form
but
of
content
that
is
of
logical
form
steinthal
the
greatest
follower
of
humboldt
solved
his
contradictions
and
in
sustained
successfully
against
the
hegelian
becker
the
thesis
that
words
are
necessary
for
thought
he
pointed
to
the
with
his
signs
to
the
mathematician
with
his
formulae
to
the
chinese
language
where
the
figurative
portion
is
an
essential
of
speech
and
declared
that
becker
was
wrong
in
believing
that
the
sanskrit
language
was
derived
from
twelve
cardinal
concepts
he
showed
effectively
that
the
concept
and
the
word
the
logical
judgment
and
the
proposition
are
not
comparable
the
proposition
is
not
a
judgment
but
the
representation
of
a
judgment
and
all
propositions
do
not
represent
logical
judgments
several
judgments
can
be
expressed
with
one
proposition
the
logical
divisions
of
judgments
the
relations
of
concepts
have
no
correspondence
in
the
grammatical
division
of
propositions
if
we
speak
of
a
logical
form
of
the
proposition
we
fall
into
a
contradiction
in
terms
not
less
complete
than
his
who
should
speak
of
the
angle
of
a
circle
or
of
the
periphery
of
a
triangle
he
who
speaks
in
so
far
as
he
speaks
has
not
thoughts
but
language
when
steinthal
had
several
times
solemnly
proclaimed
the
independence
of
language
as
regards
logic
and
that
it
produces
its
forms
in
complete
autonomy
he
proceeded
to
seek
the
origin
of
language
recognizing
with
humboldt
that
the
question
of
its
origin
is
the
same
as
that
of
its
nature
language
he
said
belongs
to
the
great
class
of
reflex
movements
but
this
only
shows
one
side
of
it
not
its
true
nature
animals
like
men
have
reflex
actions
and
sensations
though
nature
enters
the
animal
by
force
takes
it
by
assault
conquers
and
enslaves
it
with
man
is
born
language
because
he
is
resistance
to
nature
governance
of
his
own
body
and
liberty
language
is
liberation
even
we
feel
that
our
soul
becomes
lighter
and
frees
itself
from
a
weight
when
we
speak
man
before
he
attains
to
speech
must
be
conceived
of
as
accompanying
all
his
sensations
with
bodily
movements
mimetic
attitudes
gestures
and
particularly
with
articulate
sounds
what
is
still
lacking
to
him
that
he
may
attain
to
speech
the
connexion
between
the
reflex
movements
of
the
body
and
the
state
of
the
soul
if
his
sentient
consciousness
be
already
consciousness
then
he
lacks
the
consciousness
of
consciousness
if
it
be
already
intuition
then
he
lacks
the
intuition
of
intuition
in
sum
he
lacks
the
form
of
with
this
comes
speech
which
forms
the
connexion
man
does
not
choose
the
sound
of
his
speech
this
is
given
to
him
and
he
adopts
it
instinctively
when
we
have
accorded
to
steinthal
the
great
merit
of
having
rendered
coherent
the
ideas
of
humboldt
and
of
having
clearly
separated
linguistic
from
logical
thought
we
must
note
that
he
too
failed
to
perceive
the
of
the
internal
form
of
language
or
intuition
of
the
intuition
as
he
called
it
with
the
aesthetic
herbart
psychology
to
which
steinthal
adhered
did
not
afford
him
any
means
for
this
identification
herbart
separated
logic
from
psychology
calling
it
a
normative
science
he
failed
to
discern
the
exact
limits
between
feeling
and
spiritual
formation
psyche
or
soul
and
spirit
and
to
see
that
one
of
these
spiritual
formations
is
logical
thought
or
activity
which
is
not
a
code
of
laws
imposed
from
without
for
herbart
aesthetic
as
we
know
was
a
code
of
beautiful
formal
relations
thus
steinthal
following
herbart
in
psychology
was
bound
to
look
upon
art
as
a
beautifying
of
thought
linguistic
as
the
science
of
speech
rhetoric
and
aesthetic
as
the
science
of
beautiful
speech
steinthal
never
realized
that
to
speak
is
to
speak
well
or
beautifully
under
penalty
of
speaking
and
that
the
revolution
which
he
and
humboldt
had
effected
in
the
conception
of
language
must
inevitably
react
upon
and
transform
poetic
rhetoric
and
aesthetic
thus
despite
so
many
efforts
of
conscientious
analysis
on
the
part
of
humboldt
and
of
steinthal
the
unity
of
language
and
of
poetry
and
the
identification
of
the
science
of
language
and
the
science
of
poetry
still
found
its
least
imperfect
expression
in
the
prophetic
aphorisms
of
vico
the
philosophical
movement
in
germany
from
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
notwithstanding
its
many
errors
is
yet
so
notable
and
so
imposing
with
the
philosophers
already
considered
as
to
merit
the
first
place
in
the
european
thought
of
that
period
this
is
even
more
the
case
as
regards
aesthetic
than
as
regards
philosophy
in
general
france
was
the
prey
of
condillac
sensualism
and
therefore
incapable
of
duly
appreciating
the
spiritual
activity
of
art
we
hardly
get
a
glimpse
of
winckelmann
transcendental
spiritualism
in
quatremère
de
quincy
and
the
frigid
academics
of
victor
cousin
were
easily
surpassed
by
theodore
jouffroy
though
he
too
failed
of
isolating
the
aesthetic
fact
french
romanticism
defined
literature
as
the
expression
of
society
admired
under
german
influence
the
grotesque
and
the
characteristic
declared
the
independence
of
art
in
the
formula
of
art
for
art
sake
but
did
not
succeed
in
surpassing
philosophically
the
old
doctrine
of
the
imitation
of
nature
schlegel
and
solger
indeed
were
largely
responsible
for
the
romantic
movement
in
france
schlegel
with
his
belief
in
the
characteristic
or
as
the
principle
of
modern
art
which
led
him
to
admire
the
cruel
and
the
ugly
solger
with
his
dialectic
arrangement
whereby
the
finite
or
terrestrial
element
is
absorbed
and
annihilated
in
the
divine
and
thus
becomes
the
tragic
or
and
the
result
is
the
comic
rosenkranz
published
in
königsberg
an
aesthetic
of
the
ugly
and
the
works
of
vischer
and
zeising
abound
in
subtleties
relating
to
the
idea
and
to
its
expression
in
the
beautiful
and
sublime
these
writers
conceived
of
the
idea
as
the
knight
purebeautiful
constrained
to
abandon
his
tranquil
ease
through
the
machinations
of
the
ugly
the
ugly
leads
him
into
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
adventures
from
all
of
which
he
eventually
emerges
victorious
the
sublime
the
comic
the
humorous
and
so
on
are
his
marengo
austerlitz
and
jena
another
version
of
their
adventures
might
be
described
as
his
conquest
by
his
enemies
but
at
the
moment
of
conquest
he
transforms
and
irradiates
his
conquerors
to
such
a
mediocre
and
artificial
mythology
led
the
theory
of
the
modifications
of
the
beautiful
in
england
the
associationist
psychology
continued
to
hold
sway
and
showed
with
dugald
stewart
miserable
attempt
at
establishing
two
forms
of
association
its
incapacity
to
rise
to
the
conception
of
the
imagination
with
the
poet
coleridge
england
also
showed
the
influence
of
german
thought
and
coleridge
elaborated
with
wordsworth
a
more
correct
conception
of
poetry
and
of
its
difference
from
science
but
the
most
notable
contribution
in
english
at
that
period
came
from
another
poet
shelley
whose
of
contains
profound
though
unsystematic
views
as
to
the
distinction
between
reason
and
imagination
prose
and
poetry
on
primitive
language
and
on
the
poetic
power
of
objectification
in
italy
francesco
de
sanctis
gave
magnificent
expression
to
the
independence
of
art
he
taught
literature
in
naples
from
to
in
turin
and
zurich
from
to
and
after
he
was
a
professor
in
the
university
of
naples
his
della
letteratura
is
a
classic
and
in
it
and
in
monographs
on
individual
writers
he
exposed
his
doctrines
prompted
by
a
natural
love
of
speculation
he
began
to
examine
the
old
grammarians
and
rhetoricians
with
a
view
to
systematize
them
but
very
soon
he
proceeded
to
criticize
and
to
surpass
their
theories
the
cold
rules
of
reason
did
not
find
favour
with
him
and
he
advised
young
men
to
go
direct
to
the
original
works
the
philosophy
of
hegel
began
to
penetrate
italy
and
the
study
of
vico
was
again
taken
up
de
sanctis
translated
the
of
hegel
in
prison
where
the
bourbon
government
had
thrown
him
for
his
liberalism
benard
had
begun
his
translation
of
the
of
hegel
and
so
completely
in
harmony
was
de
sanctis
with
the
thought
of
this
master
that
he
is
said
to
have
guessed
from
a
study
of
the
first
volume
what
the
unpublished
volumes
must
contain
and
to
have
lectured
upon
them
to
his
pupils
traces
of
mystical
idealism
and
of
hegelianism
persist
even
in
his
later
works
and
the
distinction
which
he
always
maintained
between
imagination
and
fancy
certainly
came
to
him
from
hegel
and
schelling
he
held
fancy
alone
to
be
the
true
poetic
faculty
de
sanctis
absorbed
all
the
juice
of
hegel
but
rejected
the
husks
of
his
pedantry
of
his
formalism
of
his
apriority
fancy
for
de
sanctis
was
not
the
mystical
transcendental
apperception
of
the
german
philosophers
but
simply
the
faculty
of
poetic
synthesis
and
creation
opposed
to
the
imagination
which
reunites
details
and
always
has
something
mechanical
about
it
faith
and
poetry
he
used
to
say
are
not
dead
but
transformed
his
criticism
of
hegel
amounted
in
many
places
to
the
correction
of
hegel
and
as
regards
vico
he
is
careful
to
point
out
that
when
in
dealing
with
the
homeric
poems
vico
talks
of
generic
types
he
is
no
longer
the
critic
of
art
but
the
historian
of
civilization
de
sanctis
saw
that
achilles
must
always
be
achilles
never
a
force
or
an
abstraction
thus
de
sanctis
succeeded
in
keeping
himself
free
from
the
hegelian
domination
at
a
moment
when
hegel
was
the
acknowledged
master
of
speculation
but
his
criticism
extended
also
to
other
german
aestheticians
by
a
curious
accident
he
found
himself
at
zurich
in
the
company
of
theodore
vischer
that
ponderous
hegelian
who
laughed
disdainfully
at
the
mention
of
poetry
of
music
and
of
the
decadent
italian
race
de
sanctis
laughed
at
vischer
laughter
wagner
appeared
to
him
a
corrupter
of
music
and
nothing
in
the
world
more
unaesthetic
than
the
aesthetic
of
theodore
vischer
his
lectures
on
ariosto
and
petrarch
before
an
international
public
at
zurich
were
delivered
with
the
desire
of
correcting
the
errors
of
these
and
of
other
german
philosophers
and
learned
men
he
gave
his
celebrated
definitions
of
french
and
german
critics
the
french
critic
does
not
indulge
in
theories
one
feels
warmth
of
impression
and
sagacity
of
observation
in
his
argument
he
never
leaves
the
concrete
he
divines
the
quality
of
the
writer
genius
and
the
quality
of
his
work
and
studies
the
man
in
order
to
understand
the
writer
his
great
fault
is
shown
in
substituting
for
criticism
of
the
actual
art
work
a
historical
criticism
of
the
author
and
of
his
time
for
the
german
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
so
simple
that
he
does
not
contrive
to
distort
and
to
confuse
it
he
collects
shadows
around
him
from
which
shoot
vivid
rays
he
laboriously
brings
to
birth
that
morsel
of
truth
which
he
has
within
him
he
would
seize
and
define
what
is
most
fugitive
and
impalpable
in
a
work
of
art
although
nobody
talks
so
much
of
life
as
he
does
yet
no
one
so
much
delights
in
decomposing
and
generalizing
it
having
thus
destroyed
the
particular
he
is
able
to
show
you
as
the
result
of
this
process
final
in
appearance
but
in
reality
preconceived
and
apriorist
one
measurement
for
all
feet
one
garment
for
all
bodies
about
this
time
he
studied
schopenhauer
who
was
then
becoming
the
fashion
schopenhauer
said
of
this
criticism
of
de
sanctis
that
italian
has
absorbed
me
succum
et
what
weight
did
he
attach
to
schopenhauer
writings
on
art
having
exposed
the
theory
of
ideas
he
barely
refers
to
the
third
volume
which
contains
an
exaggerated
theory
of
aesthetic
in
his
criticism
of
petrarch
de
sanctis
finally
broke
with
metaphysical
aesthetic
saying
of
hegel
school
that
it
believed
the
beautiful
to
become
art
when
it
surpassed
form
and
revealed
the
concept
or
pure
idea
this
theory
and
the
subtleties
derived
from
it
far
from
characterizing
art
represent
its
contrary
the
impotent
velleity
for
art
which
can
not
slay
abstractions
and
come
in
contact
with
life
de
sanctis
held
that
outside
the
domain
of
art
all
is
shapeless
the
ugly
is
of
the
domain
of
art
if
art
give
it
form
is
there
anything
more
beautiful
than
iago
if
he
be
looked
upon
merely
as
a
contrast
to
othello
then
we
are
in
the
position
of
those
who
looked
upon
the
stars
as
placed
where
they
are
to
serve
as
candles
for
the
earth
form
was
for
de
sanctis
the
word
which
should
be
inscribed
over
the
entrance
to
the
temple
of
art
in
the
work
of
art
are
form
and
content
but
the
latter
is
no
longer
chaotic
the
artist
has
given
to
it
a
new
value
has
enriched
it
with
the
gift
of
his
own
personality
but
if
the
content
has
not
been
assimilated
and
made
his
own
by
the
artist
then
the
work
lacks
generative
power
it
is
of
no
value
as
art
or
literature
though
as
history
or
scientific
document
its
value
may
be
great
the
gods
of
homer
are
dead
but
the
remains
guelf
and
ghibelline
have
disappeared
from
italy
not
so
the
which
is
as
vigorous
as
when
dante
first
took
pen
in
hand
thus
de
sanctis
held
firmly
to
the
independence
of
art
but
he
did
not
accept
the
formula
of
art
for
art
sake
in
so
far
as
it
meant
separation
of
the
artist
from
life
mutilation
of
the
content
art
reduced
to
mere
dexterity
for
de
sanctis
form
was
identical
with
imagination
with
the
power
of
expressing
or
representing
his
artistic
vision
this
much
must
be
admitted
by
his
critics
but
he
never
attained
to
a
clear
definition
of
art
his
theory
of
aesthetic
always
remained
a
sketch
wonderful
indeed
but
not
clearly
developed
and
deduced
the
reason
for
this
was
de
sanctis
love
of
the
concrete
no
sooner
had
he
attained
from
general
ideas
a
sufficient
clarity
of
vision
for
his
own
purposes
than
he
plunged
again
into
the
concrete
and
particular
he
did
not
confine
his
activity
to
literature
but
was
active
also
in
politics
and
in
the
prosecution
and
encouragement
of
historical
studies
as
a
critic
of
literature
de
sanctis
is
far
superior
to
lessing
macaulay
or
taine
flaubert
genial
intuition
adumbrated
what
de
sanctis
achieved
in
one
of
his
letters
to
georges
sand
flaubert
speaks
of
the
lack
of
an
critic
in
laharpe
time
criticism
was
grammatical
in
the
time
of
and
of
taine
it
is
historical
they
analyse
with
great
subtlety
the
historical
environment
in
which
the
work
appeared
and
the
causes
which
have
produced
it
but
the
element
in
poetry
whence
does
it
come
and
composition
and
style
and
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
of
all
that
they
never
speak
for
such
a
critic
great
imagination
and
great
goodness
are
necessary
i
mean
an
faculty
of
enthusiasm
and
then
a
quality
so
rare
even
among
the
best
that
it
is
never
mentioned
de
sanctis
alone
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
flaubert
and
italy
has
in
his
writings
a
for
her
literature
unequalled
by
any
other
country
but
with
de
sanctis
the
philosopher
of
art
the
aesthetician
is
not
so
great
as
the
critic
of
literature
the
one
is
accessory
to
the
other
and
his
use
of
aesthetic
terminology
is
so
inconstant
that
a
lack
of
clearness
of
thought
might
be
found
in
his
work
by
anyone
who
had
not
studied
it
with
care
but
his
want
of
system
is
more
than
compensated
by
his
vitality
by
his
constant
citation
of
actual
works
and
by
his
intuition
of
the
truth
which
never
abandoned
him
his
writings
bear
the
further
charm
of
suggesting
new
kingdoms
to
conquer
new
mines
of
richness
to
explore
while
the
cry
of
down
with
metaphysic
was
resounding
in
germany
and
a
furious
reaction
had
set
in
against
the
sort
of
walpurgisnacht
to
which
the
later
hegelians
had
reduced
science
and
history
the
pupils
of
herbart
came
forward
and
with
an
insinuating
air
they
seemed
to
say
what
is
this
why
it
is
a
rebellion
against
metaphysic
the
very
thing
our
master
wished
for
and
tried
to
achieve
half
a
century
ago
but
here
we
are
his
heirs
and
successors
and
we
want
to
be
your
allies
an
understanding
between
us
will
be
easy
our
metaphysic
is
in
agreement
with
the
atomic
theory
our
psychology
with
mechanicism
our
ethic
and
aesthetic
with
hedonism
herbart
who
died
in
would
probably
have
disdained
and
rejected
his
followers
who
thus
courted
popularity
and
cheapened
metaphysic
putting
a
literal
interpretation
on
his
realities
his
ideas
and
representations
and
upon
all
his
most
lofty
excogitations
the
protagonist
of
these
was
robert
zimmermann
he
constructed
his
system
of
aesthetic
out
of
herbart
whom
he
perverted
to
his
own
uses
and
even
employed
the
hegelian
dialectic
in
order
to
introduce
modifications
of
the
beautiful
into
pure
beauty
the
beautiful
he
said
is
a
model
which
possesses
greatness
fulness
order
correction
and
definite
compensation
beauty
appears
to
us
in
a
characteristic
form
as
a
copy
of
this
model
vischer
against
whom
was
directed
this
work
of
zimmermann
found
it
easy
to
reply
he
ridiculed
zimmermann
meaning
of
the
symbol
as
the
object
around
which
are
clustered
beautiful
forms
does
an
artist
paint
a
fox
simply
that
he
may
depict
an
object
of
animal
nature
no
no
my
dear
sir
far
from
it
this
fox
is
a
symbol
because
the
painter
here
employs
lines
and
colours
in
order
to
express
something
different
from
lines
and
colours
think
i
am
a
fox
cries
the
painted
animal
are
mightily
mistaken
i
am
on
the
contrary
a
portmanteau
an
exhibition
by
the
painter
of
red
white
grey
and
yellow
tints
vischer
also
made
fun
of
zimmermann
enthusiasm
for
the
aesthetic
value
of
the
sense
of
touch
what
joy
it
must
be
to
touch
the
back
of
the
bust
of
hercules
in
repose
to
stroke
the
sinuous
limbs
of
the
venus
of
milo
or
of
the
faun
of
barberini
must
give
a
pleasure
to
the
hand
equal
to
that
of
the
ear
as
it
listens
to
the
puissant
fugues
of
bach
or
to
the
suave
melodies
of
mozart
vischer
defined
the
formal
aesthetic
of
zimmermann
as
a
queer
mixture
of
mysticism
and
mathematic
lotze
in
common
with
the
great
majority
of
thinkers
was
dissatisfied
with
zimmermann
but
could
only
oppose
his
formalism
with
a
variety
of
the
old
mystical
aesthetic
who
he
asked
could
believe
that
the
human
form
pleases
only
by
its
external
proportions
regardless
of
the
spirit
within
art
like
beauty
should
enclose
the
world
of
values
in
the
world
of
forms
this
struggle
between
the
aesthetic
of
the
content
and
the
aesthetic
of
the
form
attained
its
greatest
height
in
germany
between
and
with
zimmermann
vischer
and
lotze
as
protagonists
these
writers
were
followed
by
schmidt
who
in
ventured
to
say
that
both
lotze
and
zimmermann
had
failed
to
see
that
the
problem
of
aesthetic
concerned
not
the
beauty
or
ugliness
of
the
content
or
of
the
form
as
mathematical
relations
but
their
representation
köstlin
who
erected
an
immense
artificial
structure
with
the
materials
of
his
predecessors
modified
schasler
who
is
interesting
as
having
converted
the
old
vischer
to
his
thesis
of
the
importance
of
the
ugly
as
introducing
modifications
into
the
beautiful
and
being
the
principle
of
movement
there
vischer
confesses
that
at
one
time
he
had
followed
the
hegelian
method
and
believed
that
in
the
essence
of
beauty
is
born
a
disquietude
a
fermentation
a
struggle
the
idea
conquers
hurls
the
image
into
the
unlimited
and
the
sublime
is
born
but
the
image
offended
in
its
finitude
declares
war
upon
the
idea
and
the
comic
appears
thus
the
fight
is
finished
and
the
beautiful
returns
to
itself
as
the
result
of
these
struggles
but
now
he
says
schasler
has
persuaded
him
that
the
ugly
is
the
leaven
which
is
necessary
to
all
the
special
forms
of
the
beautiful
von
hartmann
is
in
close
relation
with
schasler
his
aesthetic
also
makes
great
use
of
the
ugly
since
he
insists
upon
appearance
as
a
necessary
characteristic
of
the
beautiful
he
considers
himself
justified
in
calling
his
theory
concrete
idealism
hartmann
considers
himself
in
opposition
to
the
formalism
of
herbart
inasmuch
as
he
insists
upon
the
idea
as
an
indispensable
and
determining
element
of
beauty
beauty
he
says
is
truth
but
it
is
not
historical
truth
nor
scientific
nor
reflective
truth
it
is
metaphysical
and
ideal
beauty
is
the
prophet
of
idealistic
truth
in
an
age
without
faith
hating
metaphysic
and
acknowledging
only
realistic
truth
aesthetic
truth
is
without
method
and
without
control
it
leaps
at
once
from
the
subjective
appearance
to
the
essence
of
the
ideal
but
in
compensation
for
this
it
possesses
the
fascination
of
conviction
which
immediate
intuition
alone
possesses
the
higher
philosophy
rises
the
less
need
has
she
of
passing
through
the
world
of
the
senses
and
of
science
she
approaches
ever
more
nearly
to
art
thus
philosophy
starts
on
the
voyage
to
the
ideal
like
baedeker
traveller
without
too
much
baggage
in
the
beautiful
is
immanent
logicity
the
microcosmic
idea
the
unconscious
by
means
of
the
unconscious
the
process
of
intellectual
intuition
takes
place
in
it
the
beautiful
is
a
mystery
because
its
root
is
in
the
unconscious
no
philosopher
has
ever
made
so
great
a
use
of
the
ugly
as
hartmann
he
divides
beauty
into
grades
of
which
the
one
below
is
ugly
as
compared
with
that
above
it
he
begins
with
the
mathematical
superior
to
the
sensibly
agreeable
which
is
unconscious
thence
to
formal
beauty
of
the
second
order
the
dynamically
agreeable
to
formal
beauty
of
the
third
order
the
passive
teleological
to
this
degree
belong
utensils
and
language
which
in
hartmann
view
is
a
dead
thing
inspired
with
seeming
life
only
at
the
moment
of
use
such
things
did
the
philosopher
of
the
unconscious
dare
to
print
in
the
country
of
a
humboldt
during
the
lifetime
of
a
steinthal
he
proceeds
in
his
list
of
things
beautiful
with
formal
beauty
of
the
fourth
degree
which
is
the
active
or
living
teleological
with
the
fifth
which
is
that
of
species
finally
he
reaches
concrete
beauty
or
the
individual
microcosm
the
highest
of
all
because
the
individual
idea
is
superior
to
the
specific
and
is
beauty
no
longer
formal
but
of
content
all
these
degrees
of
beauty
are
as
has
been
said
connected
with
one
another
by
means
of
the
ugly
and
even
in
the
highest
degree
which
has
nothing
superior
to
it
the
ugly
continues
its
office
of
beneficent
titillation
the
outcome
of
this
ultimate
phase
is
the
famous
theory
of
the
modifications
of
the
beautiful
none
of
these
modifications
can
occur
without
a
struggle
save
the
sublime
and
the
graceful
which
appear
without
conflict
at
the
side
of
supreme
beauty
hartmann
gives
four
instances
the
solution
is
either
immanent
logical
transcendental
or
combined
the
idyllic
the
melancholy
the
sad
the
glad
the
elegiac
are
instances
of
the
immanent
solution
the
comic
in
all
its
forms
is
the
logical
solution
the
tragic
is
the
transcendental
solution
the
combined
form
is
found
in
the
humorous
the
when
none
of
these
solutions
is
possible
we
have
the
ugly
and
when
an
ugliness
of
content
is
expressed
by
a
formal
ugliness
we
have
the
maximum
of
ugliness
the
true
aesthetic
devil
hartmann
is
the
last
noteworthy
representative
of
the
german
metaphysical
school
his
works
are
gigantic
in
size
and
appear
formidable
but
if
one
be
not
afraid
of
giants
and
venture
to
approach
near
one
finds
nothing
but
a
big
morgante
full
of
the
most
commonplace
prejudices
quite
easily
killed
with
the
bite
of
a
crab
during
this
period
aesthetic
had
few
representatives
in
other
countries
the
famous
conference
of
the
academy
of
moral
and
political
sciences
held
in
paris
in
gave
to
the
world
the
science
du
beau
of
lévèque
no
one
is
interested
in
it
now
but
it
is
amusing
to
note
that
lévèque
announced
himself
to
be
a
disciple
of
plato
and
went
on
to
attribute
eight
characteristics
to
the
beautiful
these
he
discovered
by
closely
examining
the
lily
no
wonder
he
was
crowned
with
laurels
he
proved
his
wonderful
theory
by
instancing
a
child
playing
with
its
mother
a
symphony
of
beethoven
and
the
life
of
socrates
one
of
his
colleagues
who
could
not
resist
making
fun
of
his
learned
friend
remarked
that
he
would
be
glad
to
know
what
part
was
played
in
the
life
of
a
philosopher
by
the
normal
vivacity
of
colour
thus
german
theory
made
no
way
in
france
and
england
proved
even
more
refractory
ruskin
showed
a
poverty
an
incoherence
and
a
lack
of
system
in
respect
to
aesthetic
which
puts
him
almost
out
of
court
his
was
the
very
reverse
of
the
philosophic
temperament
his
pages
of
brilliant
prose
contain
his
own
dreams
and
caprices
they
are
the
work
of
an
artist
and
should
be
enjoyed
as
such
being
without
any
value
for
philosophy
his
theoretic
faculty
of
the
beautiful
which
he
held
to
be
distinct
alike
from
the
intelligence
and
from
feeling
is
connected
with
his
belief
in
beauty
as
a
revelation
of
the
divine
intentions
the
seal
which
god
sets
upon
his
works
thus
the
natural
beauty
which
is
perceived
by
the
pure
heart
when
contemplating
some
object
untouched
by
the
hand
of
man
is
far
superior
to
the
work
of
the
artist
ruskin
was
too
little
capable
of
analysis
to
understand
the
complicated
process
taking
place
within
him
as
he
contemplated
some
streamlet
or
the
nest
of
some
small
bird
at
naples
flourished
between
and
antonio
tari
who
kept
himself
in
touch
with
the
movement
of
german
thought
and
followed
the
german
idealists
in
placing
aesthetic
in
a
sort
of
middle
kingdom
a
temperate
zone
between
the
glacial
inhabited
by
the
esquimaux
of
thought
and
the
torrid
dwelt
in
by
the
giants
of
action
he
dethroned
the
beautiful
and
put
aesthetic
in
its
place
for
the
beautiful
is
but
the
first
moment
the
later
ones
are
the
comic
the
humorous
and
the
dramatic
his
fertile
imagination
found
metaphors
and
similes
in
everything
for
instance
he
called
the
goat
the
devil
opposed
to
the
lamb
jesus
his
remarks
on
men
and
women
are
full
of
quaint
fancies
he
granted
to
women
grace
but
not
beauty
which
resides
in
equilibrium
this
is
proved
by
her
falling
down
so
easily
when
she
walks
by
her
bow
legs
which
have
to
support
her
wide
hips
made
for
gestation
by
her
narrow
shoulders
and
her
opulent
breast
she
is
therefore
a
creature
altogether
devoid
of
equilibrium
i
wish
that
it
were
possible
to
record
more
of
the
sayings
of
the
excellent
tari
the
last
joyous
priest
of
an
arbitrary
aesthetic
source
of
confusion
the
ground
lost
to
the
german
school
of
metaphysicians
was
occupied
during
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
evolutionary
and
positivist
metaphysicians
of
whom
herbert
spencer
is
the
most
notable
representative
the
peculiarity
of
this
school
lies
in
repeating
at
second
or
third
hand
certain
idealist
views
deprived
of
the
element
of
pure
philosophy
given
to
them
by
a
schelling
or
a
hegel
and
in
substituting
a
quantity
of
minute
facts
and
anecdotes
with
a
view
to
providing
the
positivist
varnish
these
theories
are
dear
to
vulgar
minds
because
they
correspond
to
inveterate
religious
beliefs
and
the
lustre
of
the
varnish
explains
the
good
fortune
of
spencerian
positivism
in
our
time
another
notable
trait
of
this
school
is
its
barbaric
contempt
for
history
especially
for
the
history
of
philosophy
and
its
consequent
lack
of
all
link
with
the
series
composed
of
the
secular
efforts
of
so
many
thinkers
without
this
link
there
can
be
no
fruitful
labour
and
no
possibility
of
progress
spencer
is
colossal
in
his
ignorance
of
all
that
has
been
written
or
thought
on
the
subject
of
aesthetic
to
limit
ourselves
to
this
branch
alone
he
actually
begins
his
work
on
the
philosophy
of
style
with
these
words
no
one
i
believe
has
ever
produced
a
complete
theory
of
the
art
of
writing
this
in
he
begins
his
chapter
on
aesthetic
feelings
in
the
of
by
admitting
that
he
has
heard
of
the
observation
made
by
a
german
author
whose
name
he
forgets
schiller
on
the
connexion
between
art
and
play
had
remarks
on
aesthetic
been
written
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
might
have
occupied
a
humble
place
among
the
first
rude
attempts
at
aesthetic
speculation
but
appearing
in
the
nineteenth
century
they
are
without
value
as
the
little
of
value
they
contain
had
been
long
said
by
others
in
his
of
spencer
looks
upon
aesthetic
feelings
as
arising
from
the
discharge
of
the
exuberant
energy
of
the
organism
this
he
divides
into
degrees
and
believes
that
we
attain
complete
enjoyment
when
these
degrees
are
all
working
satisfactorily
each
on
its
own
plane
and
when
what
is
painful
in
excessive
activity
has
been
avoided
his
degrees
are
sensation
sensation
accompanied
by
representative
elements
perception
accompanied
by
more
complex
elements
of
representation
then
emotion
and
that
state
of
consciousness
which
surpasses
sensations
and
perceptions
but
spencer
has
no
suspicion
of
what
art
really
is
his
views
oscillate
between
sensualism
and
moralism
and
he
sees
little
in
the
whole
art
of
antiquity
of
the
middle
ages
or
of
modern
times
which
can
be
looked
upon
as
otherwise
than
imperfect
the
physiology
of
aesthetics
has
also
had
its
votaries
in
great
britain
among
whom
may
be
mentioned
sully
bain
and
allen
these
at
any
rate
show
some
knowledge
of
the
concrete
fact
of
art
allen
harks
back
to
the
old
distinction
between
necessary
and
vital
activities
and
superfluous
activities
and
gives
a
physiological
definition
which
may
be
read
in
his
more
recent
writers
also
look
upon
the
physiological
fact
as
the
cause
of
the
pleasure
of
art
but
for
them
it
does
not
alone
depend
upon
the
visual
organ
and
the
muscular
phenomena
associated
with
it
but
also
on
the
participation
of
some
of
the
most
important
bodily
functions
such
as
respiration
circulation
equilibrium
intimate
muscular
accommodation
they
believe
that
art
owes
its
origin
to
the
pleasure
that
some
prehistoric
man
must
have
experienced
in
breathing
regularly
without
having
to
his
organs
when
he
traced
for
the
first
time
on
a
bone
or
on
clay
regular
lines
separated
by
regular
intervals
a
similar
order
of
researches
has
been
made
in
germany
under
the
auspices
of
helmholtz
brücke
and
stumpf
but
these
writers
have
succeeded
better
than
the
by
restricting
themselves
to
the
fields
of
optic
and
acoustic
and
have
supplied
information
as
to
the
physical
processes
of
artistic
technique
and
as
to
the
pleasure
of
visual
and
auditive
impressions
without
attempting
to
melt
aesthetic
into
physic
or
to
deprive
the
former
of
its
spiritual
character
they
have
even
occasionally
indicated
the
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
research
even
the
degenerate
herbartians
converting
the
metaphysical
forms
of
their
master
into
physiological
phenomena
made
soft
eyes
at
the
new
sensualists
and
the
natural
sciences
have
become
in
our
day
a
sort
of
superstition
allied
to
a
certain
perhaps
unconscious
hypocrisy
not
only
have
chemical
physical
and
physiological
laboratories
become
a
sort
of
sibylline
grots
where
resound
the
most
extraordinary
questions
about
everything
that
can
interest
the
spirit
of
man
but
even
those
who
really
do
prosecute
their
researches
with
the
old
inevitable
method
of
internal
observation
have
been
unable
to
free
themselves
from
the
illusion
that
they
are
on
the
contrary
employing
method
of
the
natural
hippolyte
taine
philosophy
of
art
represents
such
an
illusion
he
declares
that
when
we
have
studied
the
diverse
manifestations
of
art
in
all
peoples
and
at
all
epochs
we
shall
then
possess
a
complete
aesthetic
such
an
aesthetic
would
be
a
sort
of
botany
applied
to
the
works
of
man
this
mode
of
study
would
provide
moral
science
with
a
basis
equally
as
sure
as
that
which
the
natural
sciences
already
possess
taine
then
proceeds
to
define
art
without
regard
to
the
natural
sciences
by
analysing
like
a
simple
mortal
what
passes
in
the
human
soul
when
brought
face
to
face
with
a
work
of
art
but
what
analysis
and
what
definitions
art
he
says
is
imitation
but
of
a
sort
that
tries
to
express
an
essential
characteristic
thus
the
principal
characteristic
of
a
lion
is
to
be
a
great
carnivore
and
we
observe
this
characteristic
in
all
its
limbs
holland
has
for
essential
characteristic
that
of
being
a
land
formed
of
alluvial
soil
now
without
staying
to
consider
these
two
remarkable
instances
let
us
ask
what
is
this
essential
characteristic
of
taine
it
is
the
same
as
the
ideas
types
or
concepts
that
the
old
aesthetic
teaching
assigned
to
art
as
its
object
taine
himself
removes
all
doubt
as
to
this
by
saying
that
this
characteristic
is
what
philosophers
call
the
essence
of
things
and
for
that
reason
they
declare
that
the
purpose
of
art
is
to
manifest
things
he
declares
that
he
will
not
employ
the
word
essence
which
is
technical
but
he
accepts
and
employs
the
thought
that
the
word
expresses
he
believes
that
there
are
two
routes
by
which
man
can
attain
to
the
superior
life
science
and
art
by
the
first
he
apprehends
fundamental
laws
and
causes
and
expresses
them
in
abstract
terms
by
the
second
he
expresses
these
same
laws
and
causes
in
a
manner
comprehensible
to
all
by
appealing
to
the
heart
and
feeling
as
well
as
to
the
reason
of
man
art
is
both
superior
and
popular
it
makes
manifest
what
is
highest
and
makes
it
manifest
to
all
that
taine
here
falls
into
the
old
pedagogic
theory
of
aesthetic
is
evident
works
of
art
are
arranged
for
him
in
a
scale
of
values
as
for
the
aesthetic
metaphysicians
he
began
by
declaring
the
absurdity
of
all
judgment
of
taste
à
chacun
son
goût
but
he
ends
by
declaring
that
personal
taste
is
without
value
that
we
must
establish
a
common
measure
before
proceeding
to
praise
or
blame
his
scale
of
values
is
double
or
triple
we
must
first
fix
the
degree
of
importance
of
the
characteristic
that
is
the
greater
or
less
generality
of
the
idea
and
the
degree
of
good
in
it
that
is
to
say
its
greater
or
lesser
moral
value
these
he
says
are
two
degrees
of
the
same
thing
strength
seen
from
different
sides
we
must
also
establish
the
degree
of
convergence
of
the
effects
that
is
the
fulness
of
expression
the
harmony
between
the
idea
and
the
form
this
exposition
is
accompanied
with
the
usual
protestations
that
the
matter
in
hand
is
to
be
studied
methodically
analytically
as
the
naturalist
would
study
it
that
he
will
try
to
reach
a
law
not
a
hymn
as
if
these
protestations
could
abolish
the
true
nature
of
his
thought
taine
actually
went
so
far
as
to
attempt
dialectic
solutions
of
works
of
art
in
the
primitive
period
of
italian
art
we
find
the
soul
without
the
body
giotto
at
the
renaissance
with
verrocchio
and
his
school
we
find
the
body
without
the
soul
with
raphael
in
the
sixteenth
century
we
find
expression
and
anatomy
in
harmony
body
and
soul
thesis
antithesis
synthesis
with
fechner
we
find
the
like
protestations
and
the
like
procedure
he
will
study
aesthetic
inductively
from
beneath
he
seeks
clarity
not
loftiness
proceeding
thus
inductively
he
discovers
a
long
series
of
laws
or
principles
of
aesthetic
such
as
unity
in
variety
association
and
contrast
change
and
persistence
the
golden
mean
etc
he
exhibits
this
chaos
with
delight
at
showing
himself
so
much
of
a
physiologist
and
so
inconclusive
then
he
proceeds
to
describe
his
experiments
in
aesthetics
these
consist
of
attempts
to
decide
for
instance
by
methods
of
choice
which
of
certain
rectangles
of
cardboard
is
the
most
agreeable
and
which
the
most
disagreeable
to
a
large
number
of
people
arbitrarily
chosen
naturally
these
results
do
not
agree
with
others
obtained
on
other
occasions
but
fechner
knows
that
errors
correct
themselves
and
triumphantly
publishes
long
lists
of
these
valuable
experiments
he
also
communicates
to
us
the
shapes
and
measurements
of
a
large
number
of
pictures
in
museums
as
compared
with
their
respective
subjects
such
are
the
experiments
of
physiological
aestheticians
but
fechner
when
he
comes
to
define
what
beauty
and
what
art
really
are
is
like
everyone
else
obliged
to
fall
back
upon
introspection
but
his
definition
is
trivial
and
his
comparison
of
his
three
degrees
of
beauty
to
a
family
is
simply
grotesque
in
its
he
terms
this
theory
the
eudemonistic
theory
and
we
are
left
wondering
why
when
he
had
this
theory
all
cut
and
dried
in
his
mind
he
should
all
the
same
give
himself
the
immense
trouble
of
compiling
his
tables
and
of
enumerating
his
laws
and
principles
which
do
not
agree
with
his
theory
perhaps
it
was
all
a
pastime
for
him
like
playing
at
patience
or
collecting
another
example
of
superstition
in
respect
to
the
natural
sciences
is
afforded
by
ernest
grosse
grosse
abounds
in
contempt
for
what
he
calls
speculative
aesthetic
yet
he
desires
a
science
of
art
kunstwissenschaft
which
shall
formulate
its
laws
from
those
historical
facts
which
have
hitherto
been
collected
but
grosse
wishes
us
to
complete
the
collection
of
historical
evidence
with
ethnographical
and
prehistoric
materials
for
we
can
not
obtain
really
general
laws
of
art
from
the
exclusive
study
of
cultivated
peoples
just
as
a
theory
of
reproduction
exclusively
based
upon
the
form
it
takes
with
mammifers
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
he
is
however
aware
that
the
results
of
experiences
among
savages
and
prehistoric
races
do
not
alone
suffice
to
furnish
us
with
an
equipment
for
such
investigations
as
that
concerning
the
nature
of
art
and
like
any
ordinary
mortal
he
feels
obliged
to
interrogate
before
starting
the
spirit
of
man
he
therefore
proceeds
to
define
aesthetic
on
apriorist
principles
which
he
remarks
can
be
discarded
when
we
shall
have
obtained
the
complete
theory
in
like
manner
with
the
scaffolding
that
has
served
for
the
erection
of
a
house
words
words
vain
words
he
proceeds
to
define
aesthetic
as
the
activity
which
in
its
development
and
result
has
the
immediate
value
of
feeling
and
is
therefore
an
end
in
itself
art
is
the
opposite
of
practice
the
activity
of
games
stands
intermediate
between
the
two
having
also
its
end
in
its
own
activity
the
aesthetics
of
taine
and
of
grosse
have
been
called
sociological
seeing
that
any
true
definition
of
sociology
as
a
science
is
impossible
for
it
is
composed
of
psychological
elements
which
are
for
ever
varying
we
do
not
delay
to
criticize
the
futile
attempts
at
definition
but
pass
at
once
to
the
objective
results
attained
by
the
sociologists
this
superstition
like
the
naturalistic
takes
various
forms
in
practical
life
we
have
for
instance
proudhon
who
would
hark
back
to
platonic
aesthetic
class
the
aesthetic
activity
among
the
merely
sensual
and
command
the
arts
to
further
the
cause
of
virtue
on
pain
of
judicial
proceedings
in
case
of
contumacy
but
guyau
is
the
most
important
of
sociological
aestheticians
his
works
published
in
paris
toward
the
end
of
last
century
and
his
posthumous
work
entitled
problèmes
de
substitute
for
the
theory
of
play
that
of
and
the
posthumous
work
makes
it
evident
that
by
life
he
means
social
life
art
is
the
development
of
social
sympathy
but
the
whole
of
art
does
not
enter
into
sociology
art
has
two
objects
the
production
of
agreeable
sensations
colours
sounds
etc
and
of
phenomena
of
psychological
induction
which
include
ideas
and
feelings
of
a
more
complex
nature
than
the
foregoing
such
as
sympathy
for
the
personages
represented
interest
piety
indignation
etc
thus
art
becomes
the
expression
of
life
hence
arise
two
tendencies
one
for
harmony
consonance
for
all
that
delights
the
ear
and
eye
the
other
transforming
life
under
the
dominion
of
art
true
genius
is
destined
to
balance
these
two
tendencies
but
the
decadent
and
the
unbalanced
deprive
art
of
its
sympathetic
end
setting
aesthetic
sympathy
against
human
sympathy
if
we
translate
this
language
into
that
with
which
we
are
by
this
time
quite
familiar
we
shall
see
that
guyau
admits
an
art
that
is
merely
hedonistic
and
places
above
it
another
art
also
hedonistic
but
serving
the
ends
of
morality
nordau
wages
war
against
the
decadent
and
unbalanced
in
much
the
same
manner
as
guyau
he
assigns
to
art
the
function
of
the
integrity
of
life
so
much
broken
up
and
specialized
in
our
industrial
civilization
he
remarks
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
art
for
art
sake
the
simple
expression
of
the
internal
states
of
the
individual
but
it
is
the
art
of
the
lombroso
theory
of
genius
as
degeneration
may
be
grouped
with
the
naturalistic
theories
his
argument
is
in
essence
the
following
great
mental
efforts
and
total
absorption
in
one
dominant
thought
often
produce
physiological
disorders
or
atrophy
of
important
vital
functions
now
these
disorders
often
lead
to
madness
therefore
genius
may
be
identified
with
madness
this
proof
from
the
particular
to
the
general
does
not
follow
that
of
traditional
logic
but
with
lombroso
büchner
nordau
and
the
like
we
have
come
to
the
boundary
between
specious
and
vulgar
error
they
confuse
scientific
analysis
with
historical
research
such
inquiries
may
have
value
for
history
but
they
have
none
for
aesthetic
thus
too
lang
maintains
that
the
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
art
as
disinterested
expression
of
the
mimetic
faculty
is
not
confirmed
in
what
we
know
of
primitive
art
which
is
rather
decorative
than
expressive
but
primitive
art
which
is
a
given
fact
to
be
interpreted
can
not
ever
become
its
own
criterion
of
interpretation
the
naturalistic
misunderstanding
has
had
a
bad
effect
on
linguistic
researches
which
have
not
been
carried
out
on
the
lofty
plane
to
which
humboldt
and
steinthal
had
brought
them
max
müller
is
popular
and
exaggerated
he
fails
clearly
to
distinguish
thought
from
logical
thought
although
in
one
place
he
remarks
that
the
formation
of
names
has
a
more
intimate
connexion
with
wit
than
with
judgment
he
holds
that
the
science
of
language
is
not
historical
but
natural
because
language
is
not
the
invention
of
man
altogether
ignoring
the
science
of
the
spirit
philosophy
of
which
language
is
a
part
for
max
müller
the
natural
sciences
were
the
only
sciences
the
consciousness
of
the
science
of
the
spirit
becomes
ever
more
obscured
and
we
find
the
philologist
whitney
combating
max
miracles
and
maintaining
the
separability
of
thought
and
speech
with
hermann
paul
we
have
an
awakening
of
humboldt
spirit
paul
maintains
that
the
origin
of
language
is
the
speech
of
the
individual
man
and
that
a
language
has
its
origin
every
time
it
is
spoken
paul
also
showed
the
fallacies
contained
in
the
of
steinthal
and
lazarus
demonstrating
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
collective
soul
and
that
there
is
no
language
save
that
of
the
individual
wundt
on
the
other
hand
commits
the
error
of
connecting
language
with
ethnopsychology
and
other
sciences
and
actually
terms
the
glorious
doctrine
of
herder
and
of
humboldt
or
theory
of
miracle
accusing
them
of
mystical
obscurity
wundt
confuses
the
question
of
the
historical
appearance
of
language
with
that
of
its
internal
nature
and
genesis
he
looks
upon
the
theory
of
evolution
as
having
attained
to
its
complete
triumph
in
its
application
to
organic
nature
in
general
and
especially
to
man
he
has
no
suspicion
whatever
of
the
function
of
fancy
and
of
the
true
relation
between
thought
and
expression
between
expression
in
the
naturalistic
and
expression
in
the
spiritual
and
linguistic
sense
he
looks
upon
speech
as
a
specially
developed
form
of
vital
manifestations
of
expressive
animal
movements
language
is
developed
continuously
from
such
facts
and
thus
is
explained
how
beyond
the
general
concept
of
expressive
movement
there
is
no
specific
quality
which
delimits
language
in
a
manner
thus
the
philosophy
of
wundt
reveals
its
weak
side
showing
itself
incapable
of
understanding
the
spiritual
nature
of
language
and
of
art
in
the
of
the
same
author
aesthetic
facts
are
presented
as
a
mixture
of
logical
and
ethical
elements
a
special
normative
aesthetic
science
is
denied
and
aesthetic
is
merged
in
logic
and
ethic
the
and
movement
in
thought
was
not
able
to
maintain
the
concept
of
the
spirit
against
the
hedonistic
moralistic
and
psychological
views
of
aesthetic
in
vogue
from
about
the
middle
of
last
century
inherited
from
kant
his
view
as
to
the
slight
importance
of
the
creative
imagination
and
appears
indeed
to
have
been
ignorant
of
any
form
of
knowledge
other
than
the
intellective
kirchmann
was
one
of
the
early
adherents
to
psychological
aesthetic
defining
the
beautiful
as
the
idealized
image
of
pleasure
the
ugly
as
that
of
pain
for
him
the
aesthetic
fact
is
the
idealized
image
of
the
real
failing
to
apprehend
the
true
nature
of
the
aesthetic
fact
kirchmann
invented
a
new
psychological
category
of
ideal
or
apparent
feelings
which
he
thought
were
attenuated
images
from
those
of
real
life
the
aged
theodore
fischer
describes
aesthetic
in
his
as
the
union
of
mimetic
and
harmony
and
the
beautiful
as
the
harmony
of
the
universe
which
is
never
realized
in
fact
because
it
is
infinite
when
we
think
to
grasp
the
beautiful
we
experience
that
exquisite
illusion
which
is
the
aesthetic
fact
robert
fischer
son
of
the
foregoing
introduced
the
word
to
express
the
vitality
which
he
believed
that
man
inspired
into
things
with
the
help
of
the
aesthetic
process
siebeck
and
diez
the
former
writing
in
the
latter
in
unite
a
certain
amount
of
idealistic
influence
derived
from
kant
and
herbart
with
the
merely
empirical
and
psychological
views
that
have
of
late
been
the
fashion
diez
for
instance
would
explain
the
artistic
function
as
the
ideal
of
feeling
placing
it
parallel
to
science
the
ideal
of
thought
morality
the
ideal
of
will
and
religion
the
ideal
of
the
personality
but
this
ideal
of
feeling
escapes
definition
and
we
see
that
these
writers
have
not
had
the
courage
of
their
ideas
they
have
not
dared
to
push
their
thought
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
merely
psychological
and
associationist
view
finds
in
theodore
lipps
its
chief
exponent
he
criticizes
and
rejects
a
series
of
aesthetic
theories
such
as
those
of
play
of
pleasure
of
art
as
recognition
of
real
life
even
if
disagreeable
of
emotionality
of
syncretism
which
attaches
to
art
a
number
of
other
ends
in
addition
to
those
of
play
and
of
pleasure
the
theory
of
lipps
does
not
differ
very
greatly
from
that
of
jouffroy
for
he
assumes
that
artistic
beauty
is
the
sympathetic
our
ego
transplanted
objectified
and
recognized
in
others
is
the
object
of
sympathy
we
feel
ourselves
in
others
and
others
in
us
thus
the
aesthetic
pleasure
is
entirely
composed
of
sympathy
this
extends
even
to
the
pleasure
derived
from
architecture
geometrical
forms
etc
whenever
we
meet
with
the
positive
element
of
human
personality
we
experience
this
feeling
of
beatitude
which
is
the
aesthetic
emotion
but
the
value
of
the
personality
is
an
ethical
value
the
whole
sphere
of
ethic
is
included
in
it
therefore
all
artistic
or
aesthetic
pleasure
is
the
enjoyment
of
something
which
has
ethical
value
but
this
value
is
not
an
element
of
a
compound
but
the
object
of
aesthetic
intuition
thus
is
aesthetic
activity
deprived
of
all
autonomous
existence
and
reduced
to
a
mere
retainer
of
ethic
groos
shows
some
signs
of
recognizing
aesthetic
activity
as
a
theoretic
value
feeling
and
intellect
he
says
are
the
two
poles
of
knowledge
and
he
recognizes
the
aesthetic
fact
as
internal
imitation
everything
beautiful
belongs
to
aestheticity
but
not
every
aesthetic
fact
is
beautiful
the
beautiful
is
the
representation
of
sensible
pleasure
and
the
ugly
of
sensible
displeasure
the
sublime
is
the
representation
of
something
powerful
in
a
simple
form
the
comic
is
the
representation
of
an
inferiority
which
provokes
in
us
the
pleasurable
feeling
of
superiority
groos
very
wisely
makes
mock
of
the
supposed
function
of
the
ugly
which
hartmann
and
schasler
had
inherited
and
developed
from
a
long
tradition
lipps
and
groos
agree
in
denying
aesthetic
value
to
the
comic
but
lipps
although
he
gives
an
excellent
analysis
of
the
comic
is
nevertheless
in
the
trammels
of
his
moralistic
thesis
and
ends
by
sketching
out
something
resembling
the
doctrine
of
the
overcoming
of
the
ugly
by
means
of
which
may
be
attained
a
higher
aesthetic
and
sympathetic
value
labours
such
as
those
of
lipps
have
been
of
value
since
they
have
cleared
away
a
number
of
errors
that
blocked
the
way
and
restrained
speculation
to
the
field
of
the
internal
consciousness
similar
is
the
merit
of
véron
treatise
on
the
double
form
of
aesthetic
in
which
he
combats
the
academic
view
of
the
absolute
beauty
and
shows
that
taine
confuses
art
and
science
aesthetic
and
logic
he
acutely
remarks
that
if
the
object
of
art
were
to
reveal
the
essence
of
things
the
greatest
artists
would
be
those
who
best
succeeded
in
doing
this
and
the
greatest
works
would
all
be
whereas
we
know
that
the
very
opposite
is
the
case
véron
was
a
precursor
of
guyau
and
we
seek
for
scientific
system
in
vain
in
his
book
véron
looks
upon
art
as
two
things
the
one
pleasing
eye
and
ear
the
other
émue
de
la
personalité
humaine
he
thought
that
decorative
art
prevailed
in
antiquity
expressive
art
in
modern
times
we
can
not
here
dwell
upon
the
aesthetic
theories
of
men
of
letters
such
as
that
of
zola
developing
his
thesis
of
natural
science
and
history
mixed
which
is
known
as
that
of
the
human
document
or
as
the
experimental
theory
or
of
ibsen
and
the
moralization
of
the
art
problem
as
presented
by
him
and
by
the
scandinavian
school
perhaps
no
french
writer
has
written
more
profoundly
upon
art
than
gustave
flaubert
his
views
are
contained
in
his
correspondence
which
has
been
published
tolstoï
wrote
his
book
on
art
while
under
the
influence
of
véron
and
his
hatred
of
the
concept
of
the
beautiful
art
he
says
communicates
the
feelings
as
the
word
communicates
the
thoughts
but
his
way
of
understanding
this
may
be
judged
from
the
comparison
which
he
institutes
between
art
and
science
according
to
this
art
has
for
its
mission
to
make
assimilable
and
sensible
what
may
not
have
been
assimilated
in
the
form
of
argument
there
is
no
science
for
sake
no
art
for
art
sake
every
human
effort
should
be
directed
toward
increasing
morality
and
suppressing
violence
this
amounts
to
saying
that
all
the
art
that
the
world
has
hitherto
seen
is
false
aeschylus
sophocles
euripides
aristophanes
dante
tasso
milton
shakespeare
raphael
michael
angelo
bach
beethoven
are
all
according
to
tolstoï
false
reputations
made
by
the
critics
we
must
also
class
nietzsche
with
the
artists
rather
than
with
the
philosophers
we
should
do
him
an
injustice
as
with
ruskin
were
we
to
express
in
intellectual
terminology
his
aesthetic
affirmations
the
criticism
which
they
provoke
would
be
too
facile
nowhere
has
nietzsche
given
a
complete
theory
of
art
not
even
in
his
first
book
geburt
der
tragödie
oder
griechentum
und
what
seems
to
be
theory
there
is
really
the
confession
of
the
feelings
and
aspirations
of
the
writer
nietzsche
was
the
last
splendid
representative
of
the
romantic
period
he
was
therefore
deeply
preoccupied
with
the
art
problem
and
with
the
relation
of
art
to
natural
science
and
to
philosophy
though
he
never
succeeded
in
definitely
fixing
those
relations
from
romanticism
rather
than
from
schopenhauer
he
gathered
those
elements
of
thought
out
of
which
he
wove
his
conception
of
the
two
forms
of
art
the
apollonian
all
serene
contemplation
as
expressed
in
the
epic
and
in
sculpture
the
dionysaïc
all
tumult
and
agitation
as
expressed
in
music
and
the
drama
these
doctrines
are
not
rigorously
proved
and
their
power
of
resistance
to
criticism
is
therefore
but
slender
but
they
serve
to
transport
the
mind
to
a
more
lofty
spiritual
level
than
any
others
of
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
most
noteworthy
thought
on
aesthetic
of
this
period
is
perhaps
to
be
found
among
the
aestheticians
of
special
branches
of
the
arts
and
since
we
know
that
laws
relating
only
to
special
branches
are
not
conceivable
this
thought
may
be
considered
as
bearing
upon
the
general
theory
of
aesthetic
the
bohemian
critic
hanslick
is
perhaps
the
most
important
of
these
writers
his
work
musical
has
been
translated
into
several
languages
his
polemic
is
chiefly
directed
against
wagner
and
the
pretension
of
finding
in
music
a
determined
content
of
ideas
and
feelings
he
expresses
equal
contempt
for
those
sentimentalists
who
derive
from
music
merely
pathological
effects
passionate
excitement
or
stimulus
for
practical
activity
in
place
of
enjoying
the
musical
works
if
a
few
phrygian
notes
sufficed
to
instil
courage
into
the
soldier
facing
the
enemy
or
a
doric
melody
to
assure
the
fidelity
of
a
wife
whose
husband
was
absent
then
the
loss
of
greek
music
may
cause
pain
to
generals
and
to
husbands
but
aestheticians
and
composers
will
have
no
reason
to
deplore
it
if
every
requiem
every
lamenting
adagio
possessed
the
power
to
make
us
sad
who
would
be
able
to
support
existence
in
such
conditions
but
if
a
true
musical
work
look
upon
us
with
the
clear
and
brilliant
eyes
of
beauty
we
feel
ourselves
bound
by
its
invincible
fascination
though
its
theme
be
all
the
sorrows
of
the
century
for
hanslick
the
only
end
of
music
was
form
or
musical
beauty
the
followers
of
herbart
showed
themselves
very
tender
towards
this
unexpected
and
vigorous
ally
and
hanslick
not
to
be
behindhand
in
politeness
returned
their
compliments
by
referring
to
herbart
and
to
zimmermann
in
the
later
editions
of
his
work
as
having
completely
developed
the
great
aesthetic
principle
of
form
unfortunately
hanslick
meant
something
altogether
different
from
the
herbartians
by
his
use
of
the
word
form
symmetry
merely
acoustic
relations
and
the
pleasure
of
the
ear
did
not
constitute
the
musically
beautiful
for
him
mathematics
were
in
his
view
useless
in
the
aesthetic
of
music
sonorous
forms
are
not
empty
but
perfectly
full
they
can
not
be
compared
to
simple
lines
enclosing
a
space
they
are
the
spirit
which
takes
form
making
its
own
bodily
configuration
music
is
more
of
a
picture
than
is
an
arabesque
but
it
is
a
picture
of
which
the
subject
is
inexpressible
in
words
nor
is
it
to
be
enclosed
in
a
precise
concept
in
music
there
is
a
meaning
and
a
connexion
but
of
a
specially
musical
nature
it
is
a
language
which
we
speak
and
understand
but
which
it
is
impossible
to
translate
hanslick
admits
that
music
if
it
do
not
render
the
quality
of
sentiments
renders
their
tone
or
dynamic
side
it
renders
adjectives
if
it
fail
to
render
substantives
if
not
murmuring
tenderness
or
impetuous
courage
at
any
rate
the
murmuring
and
the
impetuous
the
essence
of
his
book
is
contained
in
the
negation
that
it
is
possible
to
separate
form
and
content
in
music
take
any
motive
you
will
and
say
where
form
begins
and
content
ends
are
we
to
call
the
sounds
content
very
good
but
they
have
already
received
form
what
are
we
to
call
form
sounds
again
but
they
are
already
form
filled
that
is
to
say
possessing
a
content
these
observations
testify
to
an
acute
penetration
of
the
nature
of
art
hanslick
belief
that
they
were
characteristics
peculiar
to
music
not
common
to
every
form
of
art
alone
prevented
him
from
seeing
further
fiedler
published
in
german
in
an
extremely
luminous
work
on
the
origin
of
artistic
activity
he
describes
eloquently
how
the
passive
spectator
seems
to
himself
to
grasp
all
reality
as
the
shows
of
life
pass
before
him
but
at
the
moment
that
he
tries
to
realize
this
artistically
all
disappears
and
leaves
him
with
the
emptiness
of
his
own
thoughts
yet
by
concentration
alone
do
we
attain
to
expression
art
is
a
language
that
we
gradually
learn
to
speak
artistic
activity
is
only
to
be
attained
by
limiting
ourselves
it
must
consist
of
forms
precisely
determined
tangible
sensibly
demonstrable
precisely
because
it
is
spiritual
art
does
not
imitate
nature
for
what
is
nature
but
that
vast
confusion
of
perceptions
and
representations
that
were
referred
to
above
yet
in
a
sense
art
does
imitate
nature
it
uses
nature
to
produce
values
of
a
kind
peculiar
to
itself
those
values
are
true
visibility
fiedler
views
correspond
with
those
of
his
predecessor
hanslick
but
are
more
rigorously
and
philosophically
developed
the
sculptor
hildebrand
may
be
mentioned
with
these
as
having
drawn
attention
to
the
nature
of
art
as
architectonic
rather
than
imitative
with
special
application
to
the
art
of
sculpture
what
we
miss
with
these
and
with
other
specialists
is
a
broad
view
of
art
and
language
as
one
and
the
same
thing
the
inheritance
of
all
humanity
not
of
a
few
persons
specially
endowed
bergson
in
his
book
on
laughter
falls
under
the
same
criticism
he
develops
his
theory
of
art
in
a
manner
analogous
to
fiedler
and
errs
like
him
in
looking
upon
it
as
something
different
and
exceptional
in
respect
to
the
language
of
every
moment
he
declares
that
in
life
the
individuality
of
things
escapes
us
we
see
only
as
much
as
suffices
for
our
practical
ends
the
influence
of
language
aids
this
rude
simplification
all
but
proper
names
are
abstractions
artists
arise
from
time
to
time
who
recover
the
riches
hidden
beneath
the
labels
of
ordinary
life
amid
the
ruin
of
idealist
metaphysics
is
to
be
desired
a
healthy
return
to
the
doctrine
of
baumgarten
corrected
and
enriched
with
the
discoveries
that
have
been
made
since
his
time
especially
by
romanticism
and
psychology
hermann
announced
this
return
but
his
book
is
a
hopeless
mixture
of
empirical
precepts
and
of
metaphysical
beliefs
regarding
logic
and
aesthetic
both
of
which
he
believes
deal
not
with
the
empirical
thought
and
experience
of
the
soul
but
with
the
pure
and
absolute
bosanquet
gives
the
following
definition
of
the
beautiful
as
that
which
has
a
characteristic
or
individual
expressivity
for
the
sensible
perception
or
for
the
imagination
subject
to
the
conditions
of
general
or
abstract
expressivity
for
the
same
means
the
problem
as
posed
by
this
writer
by
the
antithesis
of
the
two
german
schools
of
form
and
content
appears
to
us
insoluble
though
de
sanctis
left
no
school
in
italy
his
teaching
has
been
cleared
of
the
obscurities
that
had
gathered
round
it
during
the
last
ten
years
and
the
thesis
of
the
true
nature
of
history
and
of
its
nature
altogether
different
from
natural
science
has
been
also
dealt
with
in
germany
although
its
precise
relation
to
the
aesthetic
problem
has
not
been
made
clear
such
labours
and
such
discussions
constitute
a
more
favourable
ground
for
the
scientific
development
of
aesthetic
than
the
stars
of
mystical
metaphysic
or
the
stables
of
positivism
and
of
sensualism
we
have
now
reached
the
end
of
the
inquiry
into
the
history
of
aesthetic
speculation
and
we
are
struck
with
the
smallness
of
the
number
of
those
who
have
seen
clearly
the
nature
of
the
problem
no
doubt
amid
the
crowd
of
artists
critics
and
writers
on
other
subjects
many
have
incidentally
made
very
just
remarks
and
if
all
these
were
added
to
the
few
philosophers
they
would
form
a
gallant
company
but
if
as
schiller
truly
observed
the
rhythm
of
philosophy
consist
in
a
withdrawal
from
public
opinion
in
order
to
return
to
it
with
renewed
vigour
it
is
evident
that
this
withdrawal
is
essential
and
indeed
that
in
it
lies
the
whole
progress
of
philosophy
during
our
long
journey
we
have
witnessed
grave
aberrations
from
the
truth
which
were
at
the
same
time
attempts
to
reach
it
such
were
the
hedonism
of
the
sophists
and
rhetoricians
of
antiquity
of
the
sensualists
of
the
eighteenth
and
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
the
moralistic
hedonism
of
aristophanes
and
the
stoics
of
the
roman
eclectics
of
the
writers
of
the
middle
age
and
of
the
renaissance
the
ascetic
and
logical
hedonism
of
plato
and
the
fathers
of
the
church
the
aesthetic
mysticism
of
plotinus
reborn
to
its
greatest
triumphs
during
the
classic
period
of
german
thought
through
the
midst
of
these
variously
erroneous
theories
that
traverse
the
field
of
thought
in
all
directions
runs
a
tiny
rivulet
of
golden
truth
starting
from
the
subtle
empiricism
of
aristotle
it
flows
in
the
profound
penetration
of
vico
to
the
nineteenth
century
where
it
appears
again
in
the
masterly
analyses
of
schleiermacher
humboldt
and
de
sanctis
this
brief
list
shows
that
the
science
of
aesthetic
is
no
longer
to
be
discovered
but
it
also
shows
it
is
only
at
its
the
birth
of
a
science
is
like
the
birth
of
a
human
being
in
order
to
live
a
science
like
a
man
has
to
withstand
a
thousand
attacks
of
all
sorts
these
appear
in
the
form
of
errors
which
must
be
extirpated
if
the
science
is
not
to
perish
and
when
one
set
has
been
weeded
another
crops
up
when
these
have
been
dealt
with
the
former
errors
often
return
therefore
is
always
necessary
no
science
can
repose
on
its
laurels
complete
unchallenged
like
a
human
being
it
must
maintain
its
position
by
constant
efforts
constant
victories
over
error
the
general
errors
which
reveal
a
negation
of
the
very
concept
of
art
have
already
been
dealt
with
in
the
historical
summary
the
particular
errors
have
been
exposed
in
the
theory
they
may
be
divided
under
three
heads
i
errors
as
to
the
characteristic
quality
of
the
aesthetic
fact
or
ii
as
to
its
specific
quality
or
iii
as
to
its
generic
quality
these
are
contradictions
of
the
characteristics
of
intuition
of
theoretic
contemplation
and
of
spiritual
activity
which
constitute
the
aesthetic
fact
the
principal
bar
to
a
proper
understanding
of
the
true
nature
of
language
has
been
and
still
is
rhetoric
with
the
modern
form
it
has
assumed
as
style
the
rhetorical
categories
are
still
mentioned
in
treatises
and
often
referred
to
as
having
definite
existence
among
the
parts
of
speech
side
by
side
with
such
phrases
goes
that
of
the
double
form
or
metaphor
which
implies
that
there
are
two
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing
the
one
simple
the
other
ornate
kant
herbart
hegel
and
many
minor
personages
have
been
shown
to
be
victims
of
the
rhetorical
categories
and
in
our
own
day
we
have
writers
in
italy
and
in
germany
who
devote
much
attention
to
them
such
as
bonghi
and
gröber
the
latter
employs
a
phraseology
which
he
borrows
from
the
modern
schools
of
psychology
but
this
does
not
alter
the
true
nature
of
his
argument
de
sanctis
gave
perhaps
the
clearest
and
most
stimulating
advice
in
his
lectures
on
rhetoric
which
he
termed
but
even
he
failed
to
systematize
his
thought
and
we
may
say
that
the
true
critique
of
rhetoric
can
only
be
made
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
aesthetic
activity
which
is
as
we
know
and
therefore
does
not
give
rise
to
divisions
and
express
the
same
content
now
in
one
form
now
in
thus
only
can
we
drive
away
the
double
monster
of
naked
form
deprived
of
imagination
and
of
decorated
form
which
would
represent
something
more
than
imagination
the
same
remarks
apply
to
artistic
and
literary
styles
and
to
their
various
laws
or
rules
in
modern
times
they
have
generally
been
comprised
with
rhetoric
and
although
now
discredited
they
can
not
be
said
to
have
altogether
disappeared
scaliger
may
be
entitled
the
protagonist
of
the
unities
in
comparatively
modern
times
he
it
was
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
classical
bastille
and
supplied
tyrants
of
literature
like
boileau
with
some
of
their
best
weapons
lessing
opposed
the
french
rules
and
restrictions
with
german
rules
and
restrictions
giving
as
his
opinion
that
corneille
and
others
had
wrongly
interpreted
aristotle
whose
rules
did
not
really
prevent
shakespeare
from
being
included
among
correct
writers
lessing
undoubtedly
believed
in
intellectual
rules
for
poetry
aristotle
was
the
tyrant
father
of
tyrants
and
we
find
corneille
saying
est
aisé
de
avec
aristote
much
in
the
same
way
as
tartuffe
makes
his
accommodements
avec
le
ciel
in
the
next
century
several
additions
were
made
to
the
admitted
styles
as
for
instance
the
tragédie
bourgeoise
but
these
battles
of
the
rules
with
one
another
are
less
interesting
than
the
rebellion
against
all
the
rules
which
began
with
pietro
aretino
in
the
sixteenth
century
who
makes
mock
of
them
in
the
prologues
to
his
comedies
giordano
bruno
took
sides
against
the
makers
of
rules
saying
that
the
rules
came
from
the
poetry
and
therefore
there
are
as
many
genuses
and
species
of
true
rules
as
there
are
genuses
and
species
of
true
poets
when
asked
how
the
true
poets
are
to
be
known
he
replies
by
repeating
their
verses
which
either
cause
delight
or
profit
or
both
guarini
too
said
that
the
world
judges
poetry
and
its
sentence
is
without
appeal
strangely
enough
it
was
spain
that
all
through
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
led
the
van
of
revolt
against
the
rules
and
precepts
of
the
grammarians
while
torquato
tasso
remained
the
miserable
slave
of
grammarians
unworthy
to
lick
the
dust
from
his
feet
lope
de
vega
slyly
remarked
that
when
he
wrote
his
comedies
he
locked
up
the
givers
of
precepts
with
six
keys
that
they
might
not
reproach
him
marino
declared
that
he
knew
the
rules
better
than
all
the
pedants
in
the
world
but
the
true
rule
is
to
know
when
to
break
the
rules
in
accordance
with
the
manners
of
the
day
and
the
taste
of
the
age
among
the
most
acute
writers
of
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
to
be
mentioned
gravina
who
well
understood
that
a
work
of
art
must
be
its
own
criterion
and
said
so
clearly
when
praising
a
contemporary
for
a
work
which
did
not
enter
any
one
of
the
admitted
categories
unfortunately
gravina
did
not
clearly
formulate
his
views
france
of
the
eighteenth
century
produced
several
writers
like
du
bos
who
declared
that
men
will
always
prefer
the
poems
that
move
them
to
those
composed
according
to
rule
la
motte
combated
the
unities
of
place
and
time
and
batteux
showed
himself
liberal
in
respect
to
rules
voltaire
although
he
opposed
la
motte
and
described
the
three
unities
as
the
three
great
laws
of
good
sense
was
also
capable
of
declaring
that
all
styles
but
the
tiresome
are
good
and
that
the
best
style
is
that
which
is
best
used
in
england
we
find
home
in
his
of
deriding
the
critics
for
asserting
that
there
must
be
a
precise
criterion
for
distinguishing
epic
poetry
from
all
other
forms
of
composition
literary
compositions
he
held
melt
into
one
another
just
like
colours
the
literary
movement
of
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
attacked
rules
of
all
sorts
we
will
not
dwell
upon
the
many
encounters
of
these
periods
nor
record
the
names
of
those
that
conquered
gloriously
or
their
excesses
in
france
the
preface
to
the
of
hugo
in
italy
the
semiseria
di
were
clarions
of
rebellion
the
principle
first
laid
down
by
schlegel
that
the
form
of
compositions
must
be
organic
and
not
mechanic
resulting
from
the
nature
of
the
subject
from
its
internal
development
not
from
an
external
stamp
was
enunciated
in
italy
art
is
always
a
whole
a
synthesis
but
it
would
be
altogether
wrong
to
believe
that
this
empirical
defeat
of
the
styles
and
rules
implied
their
final
defeat
in
philosophy
even
writers
who
were
capable
of
dispensing
with
prejudice
when
judging
works
of
art
once
they
spoke
as
philosophers
were
apt
to
reassume
their
belief
in
those
categories
which
empirically
they
had
discarded
the
spectacle
of
these
literary
or
rhetorical
categories
raised
by
german
philosophers
to
the
honours
of
philosophical
deduction
is
even
more
amusing
than
that
which
afforded
amusement
to
home
the
truth
is
that
they
were
unable
to
free
their
aesthetic
systems
of
intellectualism
although
they
proclaimed
the
empire
of
the
mystic
idea
schelling
at
the
beginning
hartmann
at
the
end
of
the
century
furnish
a
good
example
of
this
head
and
tail
schelling
in
his
philosophy
of
art
declares
that
historically
speaking
the
first
place
in
the
styles
of
poetry
is
due
to
epic
but
scientifically
speaking
it
falls
to
lyric
in
truth
if
poetry
be
the
representation
of
the
infinite
in
the
finite
then
lyric
poetry
in
which
prevails
the
finite
must
be
its
first
moment
lyric
poetry
corresponds
to
the
first
of
the
ideal
series
to
reflection
to
knowledge
epic
poetry
corresponds
to
the
second
power
to
action
this
philosopher
finally
proceeds
to
the
unification
of
epic
and
lyric
poetry
and
from
their
union
he
deduces
the
dramatic
form
which
is
in
his
view
the
supreme
incarnation
of
the
essence
and
of
the
of
every
art
with
hartmann
poetry
is
divided
into
poetry
of
declamation
and
poetry
for
reading
the
first
is
subdivided
into
epic
lyric
and
dramatic
the
epic
is
divided
into
plastic
epic
proper
epic
pictorial
epic
and
lyrical
epic
lyric
is
divided
into
epical
lyric
lyrical
lyric
and
dramatic
lyric
dramatic
is
divided
into
lyrical
dramatic
epical
dramatic
and
dramatical
dramatic
the
second
readable
poetry
is
divided
into
poetry
which
is
chiefly
epical
lyrical
and
dramatic
with
the
tertiary
division
of
moving
comic
tragic
and
humoristic
and
poetry
which
can
all
be
read
at
once
like
a
short
story
or
that
requires
several
sittings
like
a
romance
these
brief
extracts
show
of
what
dialectic
pirouettes
and
sublime
trivialities
even
philosophers
are
capable
when
they
begin
to
treat
of
the
aesthetic
of
the
tragic
comic
and
humorous
such
false
distinctions
are
still
taught
in
the
schools
of
france
and
germany
and
we
find
a
french
critic
like
ferdinand
brunetière
devoting
a
whole
volume
to
the
evolution
of
literary
styles
or
classes
which
he
really
believes
to
constitute
literary
history
this
prejudice
less
frankly
stated
still
infests
many
histories
of
literature
even
in
italy
we
believe
that
the
falsity
of
these
rules
of
classes
should
be
scientifically
demonstrated
in
our
theory
of
aesthetic
we
have
shown
how
we
believe
that
it
should
be
demonstrated
the
proof
of
the
theory
of
the
limits
of
the
arts
has
been
credited
to
lessing
but
his
merit
should
rather
be
limited
to
having
been
the
first
to
draw
attention
to
the
problem
his
solution
was
false
but
his
achievement
nevertheless
great
in
having
posed
the
question
clearly
no
one
before
him
in
antiquity
in
the
middle
age
or
in
modern
times
had
seriously
asked
what
is
the
value
of
the
distinctions
between
the
arts
which
of
them
comes
first
which
second
leonardo
da
vinci
had
declared
his
personal
predilection
for
painting
michael
angelo
for
sculpture
but
the
question
had
not
been
philosophically
treated
before
lessing
lessing
attention
was
drawn
to
the
problem
through
his
desire
to
disprove
the
assertions
of
spence
and
of
the
comte
de
caylus
the
former
in
respect
to
the
close
union
between
poetry
and
painting
in
antiquity
the
latter
as
believing
that
a
poem
was
good
according
to
the
number
of
subjects
which
it
should
afford
the
painter
lessing
argued
thus
painting
manifests
itself
in
space
poetry
in
time
the
mode
of
manifestation
of
painting
is
through
objects
which
coexist
that
of
poetry
through
objects
which
are
consecutive
the
objects
which
coexist
or
whose
parts
are
coexistent
are
called
bodies
bodies
then
owing
to
their
visibility
are
the
true
objects
of
painting
objects
which
are
consecutive
or
whose
parts
are
consecutive
are
called
in
general
actions
actions
then
are
the
suitable
object
of
poetry
he
admitted
that
painting
might
represent
an
action
but
only
by
means
of
bodies
which
make
allusion
to
it
that
poetry
can
represent
bodies
but
only
by
means
of
actions
returning
to
this
theme
he
explained
the
action
or
movement
in
painting
as
added
by
our
imagination
lessing
was
greatly
preoccupied
with
the
naturalness
and
the
unnaturalness
of
signs
which
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
he
believed
each
art
to
be
strictly
limited
to
certain
modes
of
expression
which
are
only
overstepped
at
the
cost
of
coherency
in
the
appendix
to
his
he
quotes
plutarch
as
saying
that
one
should
not
chop
wood
with
a
key
or
open
the
door
with
an
axe
he
who
should
do
so
would
not
only
be
spoiling
both
those
utensils
but
would
also
be
depriving
himself
of
the
utility
of
both
he
believed
that
this
applied
to
the
arts
the
number
of
philosophers
and
writers
who
have
attempted
empirical
classifications
of
the
arts
is
enormous
it
ranges
in
comparatively
recent
times
from
lessing
by
way
of
schasler
solger
and
hartmann
to
richard
wagner
whose
theory
of
the
combination
of
the
arts
was
first
mooted
in
the
eighteenth
century
lotze
while
reflecting
upon
the
futility
of
these
attempts
himself
adopts
a
method
which
he
says
is
the
most
convenient
and
thereby
incurs
the
censure
of
schasler
this
method
is
in
fact
suitable
for
his
studies
in
botany
and
in
zoology
but
useless
for
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
thus
both
these
thinkers
maintained
lessing
wrong
principle
as
to
the
constancy
the
limits
and
the
peculiar
nature
of
each
art
who
among
aestheticians
has
criticized
this
principle
aristotle
had
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
when
he
refused
to
admit
that
the
distinction
between
prose
and
poetry
lay
in
an
external
fact
the
metre
schleiermacher
seems
to
have
been
the
only
one
who
was
thoroughly
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
in
analysis
indeed
he
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
what
the
arts
have
in
common
is
not
the
external
fact
which
is
an
element
of
diversity
and
connecting
such
an
observation
as
this
with
his
clear
distinction
between
art
and
what
is
called
technique
we
might
argue
that
schleiermacher
looked
upon
the
divisions
between
the
arts
as
but
he
does
not
make
this
logical
inference
and
his
thought
upon
the
problem
continues
to
be
wavering
and
undecided
nebulous
uncertain
and
contradictory
as
is
this
portion
of
schleiermacher
theory
he
has
yet
the
great
merit
of
having
doubted
lessing
theory
and
of
having
asked
himself
by
what
right
are
special
arts
held
to
be
distinct
in
art
schleiermacher
denied
the
existence
of
a
beautiful
in
and
praised
hegel
for
having
sustained
this
negation
hegel
did
not
really
deserve
this
praise
as
his
negation
was
rather
verbal
than
effective
but
the
importance
of
this
thesis
as
stated
by
schleiermacher
is
very
great
in
so
far
as
he
denied
the
existence
of
an
objective
natural
beauty
not
produced
by
the
spirit
of
man
this
theory
of
the
beautiful
in
nature
when
taken
in
a
metaphysical
sense
does
not
constitute
an
error
peculiar
to
aesthetic
science
it
forms
part
of
a
fallacious
general
theory
which
can
be
criticized
together
with
its
metaphysic
the
theory
of
aesthetic
senses
that
is
of
certain
superior
senses
such
as
sight
and
hearing
being
the
only
ones
for
which
aesthetic
impressions
exist
was
debated
as
early
as
plato
the
contains
a
discussion
upon
this
theme
which
socrates
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
exist
beautiful
things
which
do
not
reach
us
through
impressions
of
eye
or
ear
but
further
than
this
there
exist
things
which
please
the
eye
but
not
the
ear
and
therefore
the
reason
of
beauty
can
not
be
visibility
or
audibility
but
something
different
from
yet
common
to
both
perhaps
this
question
has
never
been
so
acutely
and
so
seriously
dealt
with
as
in
this
platonic
dialogue
home
herder
hegel
diderot
rousseau
berkeley
all
dealt
with
the
problem
but
in
a
more
or
less
arbitrary
manner
herder
for
instance
includes
touch
with
the
higher
aesthetic
senses
but
hegel
removes
it
as
having
immediate
contact
with
matter
as
such
and
with
its
immediate
sensible
qualities
schleiermacher
with
his
wonted
penetration
saw
that
the
problem
was
not
to
be
solved
so
easily
he
refuted
the
distinction
between
clear
and
confused
senses
he
held
that
the
superiority
of
sight
and
hearing
over
the
other
senses
lay
in
their
free
activity
in
their
capacity
of
an
activity
proceeding
from
within
and
able
to
create
forms
and
sounds
without
receiving
external
impressions
the
eye
and
the
ear
are
not
merely
means
of
perception
for
in
that
case
there
could
be
no
visual
and
no
auditive
arts
they
are
also
functions
of
voluntary
movements
which
fill
the
domain
of
the
senses
schleiermacher
however
considered
that
the
difference
was
rather
one
of
quantity
and
that
we
should
allow
to
the
other
senses
a
minimum
of
independence
the
sensualists
as
we
know
maintain
that
all
the
senses
are
aesthetic
that
is
the
hedonistic
hypothesis
which
has
been
dealt
with
and
disproved
in
this
book
we
have
shown
the
embarrassment
in
which
the
hedonists
find
themselves
when
they
have
dubbed
all
the
senses
aesthetic
or
have
been
obliged
to
differentiate
in
an
absurd
manner
some
of
the
senses
from
the
others
the
only
way
out
of
the
difficulty
lies
in
abandoning
the
attempt
to
unite
orders
of
facts
so
diverse
as
the
representative
form
of
the
spirit
and
the
conception
of
given
physical
organs
or
of
a
given
material
of
impressions
the
origin
of
classes
of
speech
and
of
grammatical
forms
is
to
be
found
in
antiquity
and
as
regards
the
latter
the
disputes
among
the
alexandrian
philosophers
the
analogists
and
the
anomalists
resulted
in
logic
being
identified
with
grammar
anything
which
did
not
seem
logical
was
excluded
from
grammar
as
a
deviation
the
analogists
however
did
not
have
it
all
their
own
way
and
grammar
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
is
a
compromise
between
these
extreme
views
that
is
it
contains
something
of
the
thought
of
chrysippus
who
composed
a
treatise
to
show
that
the
same
thing
can
be
expressed
with
different
sounds
and
of
apollonius
discolus
who
attempted
to
explain
what
the
rigorous
analogists
refused
to
admit
into
their
schemes
and
classifications
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
we
have
begun
to
emerge
from
the
superstitious
reverence
for
grammar
inherited
from
the
middle
age
such
writers
as
pott
in
his
introduction
to
humboldt
and
paul
in
his
have
done
good
service
in
throwing
doubt
upon
the
absolute
validity
of
the
parts
of
speech
if
the
old
superstitions
still
survive
tenaciously
we
must
attribute
this
partly
to
empirical
and
poetical
grammar
partly
to
the
venerable
antiquity
of
grammar
itself
which
has
led
the
world
to
forget
its
illegitimate
and
turbid
origin
the
theory
of
the
relativity
of
taste
is
likewise
ancient
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
whether
the
saying
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
could
be
traced
to
a
merely
gustatory
origin
in
this
sense
the
saying
would
be
quite
correct
as
it
is
when
applied
to
aesthetic
facts
the
eighteenth
century
writers
exhibit
a
piteous
perplexity
of
thought
on
this
subject
home
for
instance
after
much
debate
decides
upon
a
common
standard
of
taste
which
he
deduces
from
the
necessity
of
social
life
and
from
what
he
calls
a
final
cause
of
course
it
will
not
be
an
easy
matter
to
fix
this
standard
of
taste
as
regards
moral
conduct
we
do
not
seek
our
models
among
savages
so
with
regard
to
taste
we
must
have
recourse
to
those
few
whose
taste
has
not
been
corrupted
nor
spoilt
by
pleasure
who
have
received
good
taste
from
nature
and
have
perfected
it
by
education
and
by
the
practice
of
life
if
after
this
has
been
done
there
should
yet
arise
disputes
it
will
be
necessary
to
refer
to
the
principles
of
criticism
as
laid
down
in
his
book
by
the
said
home
we
find
similar
contradictions
and
vicious
circles
in
the
on
of
david
hume
we
search
his
writings
in
vain
for
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
the
man
of
taste
whose
judgments
should
be
final
although
he
asserts
that
the
general
principles
of
taste
are
universal
in
human
nature
and
admits
that
no
notice
should
be
accorded
to
perversions
and
ignorance
yet
there
exist
diversities
of
taste
that
are
irreconcilable
insuperable
and
blameless
but
the
criticism
of
the
sensualist
and
relativist
positions
can
not
be
made
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
who
proclaim
the
absolute
nature
of
taste
and
yet
place
it
among
the
intellectual
concepts
it
has
been
shown
to
be
impossible
to
escape
from
sensualism
and
relativity
save
by
falling
into
the
intellectualist
error
muratori
in
the
eighteenth
century
is
an
instance
of
this
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
maintain
the
existence
of
a
rule
of
taste
and
of
universal
beauty
andré
also
spoke
of
what
appears
beautiful
in
a
work
of
art
as
being
not
that
which
pleases
at
once
owing
to
certain
particular
dispositions
of
the
faculties
of
the
soul
and
of
the
organs
of
the
body
but
that
which
has
the
right
of
pleasing
the
reason
and
reflection
through
its
own
excellence
voltaire
admitted
an
universal
taste
which
was
intellectual
as
did
many
others
kant
appeared
and
condemned
alike
the
intellectualist
and
the
sensualistic
error
but
placing
the
beautiful
in
a
symbol
of
morality
he
failed
to
discover
the
imaginative
absoluteness
of
taste
later
speculative
philosophy
did
not
attach
importance
to
the
question
the
correct
solution
was
slow
in
making
its
way
it
lies
as
we
know
in
the
fact
that
to
judge
a
work
of
art
we
must
place
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
artist
at
the
time
of
production
and
that
to
judge
is
to
reproduce
alexander
pope
in
his
on
was
among
the
first
to
state
this
truth
a
perfect
judge
will
read
each
work
of
wit
with
the
same
spirit
that
its
author
writ
remarks
equally
luminous
were
made
by
antonio
conti
terrasson
and
heydenreich
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
latter
with
considerable
philosophical
development
de
sanctis
gave
in
his
adhesion
to
this
formula
but
a
true
theory
of
aesthetic
criticism
had
not
yet
been
given
because
for
such
was
necessary
not
only
an
exact
conception
of
nature
in
art
but
also
of
the
relations
between
the
aesthetic
fact
and
its
historical
conditions
in
more
recent
times
has
been
denied
the
possibility
of
aesthetic
criticism
it
has
been
looked
upon
as
merely
individual
and
capricious
and
historical
criticism
has
been
set
up
in
its
place
this
would
be
better
called
a
criticism
of
extrinsic
erudition
and
of
bad
philosophical
inspiration
positivist
and
materialist
the
true
history
of
literature
will
always
require
the
reconstruction
and
then
the
judgment
of
the
work
of
art
those
who
have
wished
to
react
against
such
emasculated
erudition
have
often
thrown
themselves
into
the
opposite
extreme
that
is
into
a
dogmatic
abstract
intellectualistic
or
moralistic
form
of
criticism
this
mention
of
the
history
of
certain
doctrines
relating
to
aesthetic
suffices
to
show
the
range
of
error
possible
in
the
theory
aesthetic
has
need
to
be
surrounded
by
a
vigilant
and
vigorous
critical
literature
which
shall
derive
from
it
and
be
at
once
its
safeguard
and
its
source
of
strength
appendix
i
here
add
as
an
appendix
at
the
request
of
the
author
a
translation
of
his
lecture
which
he
delivered
before
the
third
international
congress
of
philosophy
at
heidelberg
on
september
the
reader
will
find
that
it
throws
a
vivid
light
upon
benedetto
general
theory
of
aesthetic
pure
intuition
and
the
lyrical
character
of
art
lecture
delivered
at
heidelberg
at
the
second
general
session
of
the
third
international
congress
of
there
exists
an
aesthetic
which
although
it
admits
the
existence
of
facts
called
aesthetic
or
artistic
yet
holds
that
they
are
irreducible
to
a
single
principle
to
a
rigorous
philosophical
concept
it
wishes
to
limit
itself
to
collecting
as
many
of
those
facts
as
possible
and
in
the
greatest
possible
variety
thence
at
the
most
proceeding
to
group
them
together
in
classes
and
types
the
logical
ideal
of
this
school
as
declared
on
many
occasions
is
zoology
or
botany
this
aesthetic
when
asked
what
art
is
replies
by
indicating
successively
single
facts
and
by
saying
art
is
this
and
this
and
this
too
is
art
and
so
on
indefinitely
zoology
and
botany
renew
the
representatives
of
fauna
and
of
flora
in
the
same
way
they
calculate
that
the
species
renewed
amount
to
some
thousand
but
believe
that
they
might
easily
be
increased
to
twenty
or
a
hundred
thousand
or
even
to
a
million
or
to
infinity
there
is
another
aesthetic
which
has
been
called
hedonistic
utilitarian
moralistic
and
so
on
according
to
its
various
manifestations
its
complex
denomination
should
however
be
because
that
is
precisely
what
constitutes
its
essential
character
this
aesthetic
differs
from
the
preceding
in
the
belief
that
aesthetic
or
artistic
facts
are
not
a
merely
empirical
or
nominalistic
grouping
together
but
that
all
of
them
possess
a
common
foundation
its
foundation
is
placed
in
the
practical
form
of
human
activity
those
facts
are
therefore
considered
either
generically
as
manifestations
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
therefore
rather
as
economic
facts
or
more
particularly
as
a
special
class
of
those
manifestations
or
again
as
instruments
and
products
of
the
ethical
spirit
which
subdues
and
turns
to
its
own
ends
individual
hedonistic
and
economic
tendencies
there
is
a
third
aesthetic
the
which
while
also
recognizing
the
reducibility
of
aesthetic
facts
to
philosophical
treatment
explains
them
as
particular
cases
of
logical
thought
identifying
beauty
with
intellectual
truth
art
now
with
the
natural
sciences
now
with
philosophy
for
this
aesthetic
what
is
prized
in
art
is
what
is
learned
from
it
the
only
distinction
that
it
admits
between
art
and
science
or
art
and
philosophy
is
at
the
most
that
of
more
or
less
or
of
perfection
and
imperfection
according
to
this
aesthetic
art
would
be
the
whole
mass
of
easy
and
popular
truths
or
it
would
be
a
transitory
form
of
science
a
and
a
preparatory
to
the
superior
and
perfect
form
of
science
and
of
philosophy
a
fourth
aesthetic
there
is
which
may
be
called
it
springs
from
the
criticism
of
the
positions
just
now
indicated
and
being
guided
by
a
powerful
consciousness
of
the
truth
rejects
them
all
because
it
finds
them
too
evidently
false
and
because
it
is
too
loth
to
admit
that
art
is
a
simple
fact
of
pleasure
or
pain
an
exercise
of
virtue
or
a
fragmentary
sketch
of
science
and
philosophy
and
while
rejecting
them
it
discovers
at
the
same
time
that
art
is
not
now
this
and
now
that
of
those
things
or
of
other
things
indefinitely
but
that
it
has
its
own
principle
and
origin
however
it
is
not
able
to
say
what
this
principle
may
be
and
believes
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
this
aesthetic
knows
that
art
can
not
be
resolved
into
an
empirical
concept
knows
that
pleasure
and
pain
are
united
with
the
aesthetic
activity
only
in
an
indirect
manner
that
morality
has
nothing
to
do
with
art
that
it
is
impossible
to
rationalize
art
as
is
the
case
with
science
and
philosophy
and
to
prove
it
beautiful
or
ugly
with
the
aid
of
reason
here
this
aesthetic
is
content
to
stop
satisfied
with
a
knowledge
consisting
entirely
of
negative
terms
finally
there
is
an
aesthetic
which
i
have
elsewhere
proposed
to
call
this
aesthetic
avails
itself
of
those
negative
terms
to
define
art
as
a
spiritual
form
without
a
practical
character
because
it
is
theoretic
and
without
a
logical
or
intellective
form
because
it
is
a
theoretic
form
differing
alike
from
those
of
science
and
of
philosophy
and
superior
to
both
according
to
this
view
art
would
be
the
highest
pinnacle
of
knowledge
whence
what
is
seen
from
other
points
seems
narrow
and
partial
art
would
alone
reveal
the
whole
horizon
or
all
the
abysses
of
reality
now
the
five
aesthetics
so
far
mentioned
are
not
referable
to
contingent
facts
and
historical
epochs
as
are
on
the
other
hand
the
denominations
of
greek
and
mediaeval
aesthetic
of
renaissance
and
aesthetic
the
aesthetic
of
wolff
and
of
herbart
of
vico
and
of
hegel
these
five
are
on
the
contrary
mental
attitudes
which
are
found
in
all
periods
although
they
have
not
always
conspicuous
representatives
of
the
kind
that
are
said

historical
empirical
aesthetic
is

example

at

kant
in
the
eighteenth
century
mystic
aesthetic
is
called
neoplatonism
at
the
end
of
the
antique
world
romanticism
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
if
it
be
adorned
during
the
former
period
with
the
name
of
plotinus
in
the
latter
it
will
bear
the
name
of
schelling
or
of
solger
and
not
only
are
those
attitudes
and
mental
tendencies
common
to
all
epochs
but
they
are
also
all
found
to
some
extent
developed
or
indicated
in
every
thinker
and
even
in
every
man
thus
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
classify
philosophers
of
aesthetic
according
to
one
or
the
other
category
because
each
philosopher
also
enters
more
or
less
into
some
other
or
into
all
the
other
categories
nor
can
these
five
conceptions
and
points
of
view
be
looked
upon
as
increasable
to
ten
or
twenty
or
to
as
many
as
desired
or
that
i
have
placed
them
in
a
certain
order
but
that
they
could
be
capriciously
placed
in
another
order
if
this
were
so
they
would
be
altogether
heterogeneous
and
disconnected
among
themselves
and
the
attempt
to
examine
and
criticize
them
would
seem
altogether
desperate
as
also
would
be
that
of
comparing
one
with
the
other
or
of
stating
a
new
one
which
should
dominate
them
all
it
is
precisely
thus
that
ordinary
sceptics
look
upon
various
and
contrasting
scientific
views
they
group
them
all
in
the
same
plane
and
believing
that
they
can
increase
them
at
will
conclude
that
one
is
as
good
as
another
and
that
therefore
every
one
is
free
to
select
that
which
he
prefers
from
a
bundle
of
falsehoods
the
conceptions
of
which
we
speak
are
definite
in
number
and
appear
in
a
necessary
order
which
is
either
that
here
stated
by
me
or
another
which
might
be
proposed
better
than
mine
this
would
be
the
necessary
order
which
i
should
have
failed
to
realize
effectively
they
are
connected
one
with
the
other
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
view
which
follows
includes
in
itself
that
which
precedes
it
thus
if
the
last
of
the
five
doctrines
indicated
be
taken
which
may
be
summed
up
as
the
proposition
that
art
is
a
form
of
the
theoretic
spirit
superior
to
the
scientific
and
philosophic
form
and
if
it
be
submitted
to
analysis
it
will
be
seen
that
in
it
is
included
in
the
first
place
the
proposition
affirming
the
existence
of
a
group
of
facts
which
are
called
aesthetic
or
artistic
if
such
facts
did
not
exist
it
is
evident
that
no
question
would
arise
concerning
them
and
that
no
systematization
would
be
attempted
and
this
is
the
truth
of
empirical
aesthetic
but
there
is
also
contained
in
it
the
proposition
that
the
facts
examined
are
reducible
to
a
definite
principle
or
category
of
the
spirit
this
amounts
to
saying
that
they
belong
either
to
the
practical
spirit
or
to
the
theoretical
or
to
one
of
their
subforms
and
this
is
the
truth
of
practicist
aesthetic
which
is
occupied
with
the
enquiry
as
to
whether
these
ever
are
practical
facts
and
affirms
that
in
every
case
they
are
a
special
category
of
the
spirit
thirdly
there
is
contained
in
it
the
proposition
that
they
are
not
practical
facts
but
facts
which
should
rather
be
placed
near
the
facts
of
logic
or
of
thought
this
is
the
truth
of
intellectualistic
aesthetic
in
the
fourth
place
we
find
also
the
proposition
that
aesthetic
facts
are
neither
practical
nor
of
that
theoretic
form
which
is
called
logical
and
intellective
they
are
something
which
can
not
be
identified
with
the
categories
of
pleasure
nor
of
the
useful
nor
with
those
of
ethic
nor
with
those
of
logical
truth
they
are
something
of
which
it
is
necessary
to
find
a
further
definition
this
is
the
truth
of
that
aesthetic
which
is
termed
agnostic
or
negative
when
these
various
propositions
are
severed
from
their
connection
when
that
is
to
say
the
first
is
taken
without
the
second
the
second
without
the
third
and
so
on
and
when
each
thus
mutilated
is
confined
in
itself
and
the
enquiry
which
awaits
prosecution
is
arbitrarily
arrested
then
each
one
of
these
gives
itself
out
as
the
whole
of
them
that
is
as
the
completion
of
the
enquiry
in
this
way
each
becomes
error
and
the
truths
contained
in
empiricism
in
practicism
in
intellectualism
in
agnostic
and
in
mystical
aesthetic
become
respectively
falsity
and
these
tendencies
of
speculation
are
indicated
with
names
of
a
definitely
depreciative
colouring
empiria
becomes
empiricism
the
heuristic
comparison
of
the
aesthetic
activity
with
the
practical
and
logical
becomes
a
conclusion
and
therefore
practicism
and
intellectualism
the
criticism
which
rejects
false
definitions
and
is
itself
negative
affirms
itself
as
positive
and
definite
becoming
agnosticism
and
so
on
but
the
attempt
to
close
a
mental
process
in
an
arbitrary
manner
is
vain
and
of
necessity
causes
remorse
and
thus
it
comes
about
that
each
one
of
those
unilateral
and
erroneous
doctrines
continually
tends
to
surpass
itself
and
to
enter
the
stage
which
follows
it
thus
empiricism
for
example
assumes
that
it
can
dispense
with
any
philosophical
conception
of
art
but
since
it
severs
art
from
and
however
empirical
it
be
it
will
not
identify
a
sketch
and
a
table
of
logarithms
as
if
they
were
just
the
same
thing
or
a
painting
and
milk
or
blood
although
milk
and
blood
both
possess
colour
thus
empiricism
too
must
at
last
resort
to
some
kind
of
philosophical
concept
therefore
we
see
the
empiricists
becoming
turn
and
turn
about
hedonists
moralists
intellectualists
agnostics
mystics
and
sometimes
they
are
even
better
than
mystics
upholding
an
excellent
conception
of
art
which
can
only
be
found
fault
with
because
introduced
surreptitiously
and
without
justification
if
they
do
not
make
that
progress
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
speak
in
any
way
of
aesthetic
facts
they
must
return
as
regards
such
facts
to
that
indifference
and
to
that
silence
from
which
they
had
emerged
when
they
affirmed
the
existence
of
these
facts
and
began
to
consider
them
in
their
variety
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
other
unilateral
doctrines
they
are
all
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
advancing
or
of
going
back
and
in
so
far
as
they
do
not
wish
to
do
either
they
live
amid
contradictions
and
in
anguish
but
they
do
free
themselves
from
these
more
or
less
slowly
and
thus
are
compelled
to
advance
more
or
less
slowly
and
here
we
discover
why
it
is
so
difficult
and
indeed
impossible
exactly
to
identify
thinkers
philosophers
and
writers
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
doctrines
which
we
have
enunciated
because
each
one
of
them
rebels
when
he
finds
himself
limited
to
one
of
those
categories
and
it
seems
to
him
that
he
is
shut
up
in
prison
it
is
precisely
because
those
thinkers
try
to
shut
themselves
up
in
a
unilateral
doctrine
that
they
do
not
succeed
and
that
they
take
a
step
now
in
one
direction
now
in
another
and
are
conscious
of
being
now
on
this
side
now
on
the
other
of
the
criticisms
which
are
addressed
to
them
but
the
critics
fulfil
their
duty
by
putting
them
in
prison
thus
throwing
into
relief
the
absurdity
into
which
they
are
led
by
their
irresolution
or
their
resolution
not
to
resolve
and
from
this
necessary
connection
and
progressive
order
of
the
various
propositions
indicated
arise
also
the
resolve
the
counsel
the
exhortation
to
return
as
they
say
to
this
or
that
thinker
to
this
or
that
philosophical
school
of
the
past
certainly
such
returns
are
impossible
understood
literally
they
are
also
a
little
ridiculous
like
all
impossible
attempts
we
can
never
return
to
the
past
precisely
because
it
is
the
past
no
one
is
permitted
to
free
himself
from
the
problems
which
are
put
by
the
present
and
which
he
must
solve
with
all
the
means
of
the
present
which
includes
in
it
the
means
of
the
past
nevertheless
it
is
a
fact
that
the
history
of
philosophy
everywhere
resounds
with
cries
of
return
those
very
people
who
in
our
day
deride
the
return
to
hume
or
the
return
to
kant
proceed
to
advise
the
return
to
schelling
or
the
return
to
hegel
this
means
that
we
must
not
understand
those
returns
literally
and
in
a
material
way
in
truth
they
do
not
express
anything
but
the
necessity
and
the
ineliminability
of
the
logical
process
explained
above
for
which
the
affirmations
contained
in
philosophical
problems
appear
connected
with
one
another
in
such
a
way
that
the
one
follows
the
other
surpasses
it
and
includes
it
in
itself
empiricism
practicism
intellectualism
agnosticism
mysticism
are
stages
of
the
search
for
they
are
eternally
relived
and
rethought
in
the
truth
which
each
contains
thus
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
who
had
not
yet
turned
his
attention
to
aesthetic
facts
to
begin
by
passing
them
before
his
eyes
that
is
to
say
he
must
first
traverse
the
empirical
stage
about
equivalent
to
that
occupied
by
mere
men
of
letters
and
mere
amateurs
of
art
and
while
he
is
at
this
stage
he
must
be
aroused
to
feel
the
want
of
a
principle
of
explanation
by
making
him
compare
his
present
knowledge
with
the
facts
and
see
if
they
are
explained
by
it
that
is
to
say
if
they
be
utilitarian
and
moral
or
logical
and
intellective
then
we
should
drive
him
who
has
made
this
examination
to
the
conclusion
that
the
aesthetic
activity
is
something
different
from
all
known
forms
a
form
of
the
spirit
which
it
yet
remains
to
characterize
for
the
empiricists
of
aesthetic
intellectualism
and
moralism
represent
progress
for
the
intellectualists
hedonistic
and
moralistic
alike
agnosticism
is
progress
and
may
be
called
kant
but
for
kantians
who
are
real
kantians
and
not
progress
is
represented
by
the
mystical
and
romantic
point
of
view
not
because
this
comes
after
the
doctrine
of
kant
chronologically
but
because
it
surpasses
it
ideally
in
this
sense
and
in
this
sense
alone
we
should
now
return
to
the
romantic
aesthetic
we
should
return
to
it
because
it
is
ideally
superior
to
all
the
researches
in
aesthetic
made
in
the
studies
of
psychologists
of
and
of
of
the
universities
of
europe
and
of
america
it
is
ideally
superior
to
the
sociological
comparative
prehistoric
aesthetic
which
studies
especially
the
art
of
savages
of
children
of
madmen
and
of
idiots
it
is
ideally
superior
also
to
that
other
aesthetic
which
has
recourse
to
the
conceptions
of
the
genetic
pleasure
of
games
of
illusion
of
of
association
of
hereditary
habit
of
sympathy
of
social
efficiency
and
so
on
it
is
ideally
superior
to
the
attempts
at
logical
explanation
which
have
not
altogether
ceased
even
although
they
are
somewhat
rare
because
to
tell
the
truth
fanaticism
for
logic
can
not
be
called
the
failing
of
our
times
finally
it
is
ideally
superior
to
that
aesthetic
which
repeats
with
kant
that
the
beautiful
is
finality
without
the
idea
of
end
disinterested
pleasure
necessary
and
universal
which
is
neither
theoretical
nor
practical
but
participates
in
both
forms
or
combines
them
in
itself
in
an
original
and
ineffable
manner
but
we
should
return
to
it
bringing
with
us
the
experience
of
a
century
of
thought
the
new
facts
collected
the
new
problems
that
have
arisen
the
new
ideas
that
have
matured
thus
we
shall
return
again
to
the
stage
of
mystical
and
romantic
aesthetic
but
not
to
the
personal
and
historical
stage
of
its
representatives
for
in
this
matter
at
least
they
are
certainly
inferior
to
us
they
lived
a
century
ago
and
therefore
inherited
so
much
the
less
of
the
problems
and
of
the
results
of
thought
which
day
by
day
mankind
laboriously
accumulates
they
should
return
but
not
to
remain
there
because
if
a
return
to
the
romantic
aesthetic
be
advisable
for
the
kantians
while
the
idealists
should
not
be
advised
to
return
to
kant
that
is
to
say
to
a
lower
stage
which
represents
a
recession
so
those
who
come
over
or
already
find
themselves
on
the
ground
of
mystical
aesthetic
should
on
the
other
hand
be
advised
to
proceed
yet
further
in
order
to
attain
to
a
doctrine
which
represents
a
stage
above
it
this
doctrine
is
that
of
the
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
of
pure
expression
a
doctrine
which
also
numbers
representatives
in
all
times
and
which
may
be
said
to
be
immanent
alike
in
all
the
discourses
that
are
held
and
in
all
the
judgments
that
are
passed
upon
art
as
in
all
the
best
criticism
and
artistic
and
literary
history
this
doctrine
arises
logically
from
the
contradictions
of
mystical
aesthetic
i
say
because
it
contains
in
itself
those
contradictions
and
their
solution
although
and
this
point
does
not
at
present
concern
us
that
critical
process
be
not
always
comprehensible
explicit
and
apparent
mystical
aesthetic
which
makes
of
art
the
supreme
function
of
the
theoretic
spirit
or
at
least
a
function
superior
to
that
of
philosophy
becomes
involved
in
inextricable
difficulties
how
could
art
ever
be
superior
to
philosophy
if
philosophy
make
of
art
its
object
that
is
to
say
if
it
place
art
beneath
itself
in
order
to
analyse
and
define
it
and
what
could
this
new
knowledge
be
supplied
by
art
and
by
the
aesthetic
activity
appearing
when
the
human
spirit
has
come
full
circle
after
it
has
imagined
perceived
thought
abstracted
calculated
and
constructed
the
whole
world
of
thought
and
history
as
the
result
of
those
difficulties
and
contradictions
mystical
aesthetic
itself
also
exhibits
the
tendency
either
to
surpass
its
boundary
or
to
sink
below
its
proper
level
the
descent
takes
place
when
it
falls
back
into
agnosticism
affirming
that
art
is
art
that
is
a
spiritual
form
altogether
different
from
the
others
and
ineffable
or
worse
where
it
conceives
art
as
a
sort
of
repose
or
as
a
game
as
though
diversion
could
ever
be
a
category
and
the
spirit
know
repose
we
find
an
attempt
at
overpassing
its
proper
limit
when
art
is
placed
below
philosophy
as
inferior
to
it
but
this
overpassing
remains
a
simple
attempt
because
the
conception
of
art
as
instrument
of
universal
truth
is
always
firmly
held
save
that
this
instrument
is
declared
less
perfect
and
less
efficacious
than
the
philosophical
instrument
thus
they
fall
back
again
into
intellectualism
from
another
side
these
mistakes
of
mystical
aesthetic
were
manifested
during
the
romantic
period
in
some
celebrated
paradoxes
such
as
those
of
as
and
of
the
of
they
seemed
calculated
to
drive
philosophers
to
desperation
as
to
the
possibility
of
solving
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
art
since
every
path
of
solution
appeared
closed
indeed
whoever
reads
the
aestheticians
of
the
romantic
period
feels
strongly
inclined
to
believe
himself
at
the
heart
of
the
enquiry
and
to
nourish
a
confident
hope
of
immediate
discovery
of
the
truth
above
all
the
affirmation
of
the
theoretic
nature
of
art
and
of
the
difference
between
its
cognitive
method
and
that
of
science
and
of
logic
is
felt
as
a
definite
conquest
which
can
indeed
be
combined
with
other
elements
but
which
must
not
in
any
case
be
allowed
to
slip
between
the
fingers
and
further
it
is
not
true
that
all
ways
of
solution
are
closed
or
that
all
have
been
attempted
there
is
at
least
one
still
open
that
can
be
tried
and
it
is
precisely
that
for
which
we
resolutely
declare
ourselves
the
aesthetic
of
the
pure
intuition
this
aesthetic
reasons
as
follows
hitherto
in
all
attempts
to
define
the
place
of
art
it
has
been
sought
either
at
the
summit
of
the
theoretic
spirit
above
philosophy
or
at
least
in
the
circle
of
philosophy
itself
but
is
not
the
loftiness
of
the
search
the
reason
why
no
satisfactory
result
has
hitherto
been
obtained
why
not
invert
the
attempt
and
instead
of
forming
the
hypothesis
that
art
is
of
the
summits
or
the
highest
of
the
theoretic
spirit
form
the
very
opposite
hypothesis
namely
that
it
is
of
the
lower
or
the
lowest
of
all
perhaps
such
epithets
as
lower
and
lowest
are
irreconcilable
with
the
dignity
and
with
the
splendid
beauty
of
art
but
in
the
philosophy
of
the
spirit
such
words
as
lowest
weak
simple
elementary
possess
only
the
value
of
a
scientific
terminology
all
the
forms
of
the
spirit
are
necessary
and
the
higher
is
so
only
because
there
is
the
lower
and
the
lower
is
as
much
to
be
despised
or
less
to
be
valued
to
the
same
extent
as
the
first
step
of
a
stair
is
despicable
or
of
less
value
in
respect
to
the
topmost
step
let
us
compare
art
with
the
various
forms
of
the
theoretic
spirit
and
let
us
begin
with
the
sciences
which
are
called
or
the
aesthetic
of
pure
intuition
makes
it
clear
that
the
said
sciences
are
more
than
history
because
they
presuppose
historical
material
that
is
collections
of
things
that
have
happened
to
men
or
animals
to
the
earth
or
to
the
stars
they
submit
this
material
to
a
further
treatment
which
consists
in
the
abstraction
and
systematization
of
the
historical
facts
then
is
less
complex
than
the
natural
sciences
history
further
presupposes
the
world
of
the
imagination
and
the
pure
philosophical
concepts
or
categories
and
produces
its
judgments
or
historical
propositions
by
means
of
the
synthesis
of
the
imagination
with
the
concept
and
may
be
said
to
be
even
less
complex
than
history
in
so
far
as
it
is
distinguished
from
the
former
as
an
activity
whose
special
function
it
is
to
make
clear
the
categories
or
pure
concepts
neglecting
in
a
certain
sense
at
any
rate
the
world
of
phenomena
if
we
compare
with
the
three
forms
above
mentioned
it
must
be
declared
inferior
that
is
to
say
less
complex
than
the
in
so
far
as
it
is
altogether
without
abstractions
in
so
far
as
it
is
without
conceptual
determinations
and
does
not
distinguish
between
the
real
and
the
unreal
what
has
really
happened
and
what
has
been
dreamed
it
must
be
declared
inferior
to
in
so
far
as
it
fails
altogether
to
surpass
the
phenomenal
world
and
does
not
attain
to
the
definitions
of
the
pure
concepts
it
is
inferior
to
itself
it
is
also
inferior
to
assuming
that
religion
is
as
it
is
a
form
of
speculative
truth
standing
between
thought
and
imagination
art
is
governed
entirely
by
imagination
its
only
riches
are
images
art
does
not
classify
objects
nor
pronounce
them
real
or
imaginary
nor
qualify
them
nor
define
them
art
feels
and
represents
them
nothing
more
art
therefore
is
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
mode
of
knowledge
not
abstract
but
concrete
and
in
so
far
as
it
uses
the
real
without
changing
or
falsifying
it
in
so
far
as
it
apprehends
it
immediately
before
it
is
modified
and
made
clear
by
the
concept
it
must
be
called
the
strength
of
art
lies
in
being
thus
simple
nude
and
poor
its
strength
as
often
happens
in
life
arises
from
its
very
weakness
hence
its
fascination
if
to
employ
an
image
much
used
by
philosophers
for
various
ends
we
think
of
man
in
the
first
moment
that
he
becomes
aware
of
theoretical
life
with
mind
still
clear
of
every
abstraction
and
of
every
reflexion
in
that
first
purely
intuitive
instant
he
must
be
a
poet
he
contemplates
the
world
with
ingenuous
and
admiring
eyes
he
sinks
and
loses
himself
altogether
in
that
contemplation
by
creating
the
first
representations
and
by
thus
inaugurating
the
life
of
knowledge
art
continually
renews
within
our
spirit
the
aspects
of
things
which
thought
has
submitted
to
reflexion
and
the
intellect
to
abstraction
thus
art
perpetually
makes
us
poets
again
without
art
thought
would
lack
the
stimulus
the
very
material
for
its
hermeneutic
and
critical
labour
art
is
the
root
of
all
our
theoretic
life
to
be
the
root
not
the
flower
or
the
fruit
is
the
function
of
art
and
without
a
root
there
can
be
no
flower
and
no
fruit
ii
such
is
the
theory
of
art
as
pure
intuition
in
its
fundamental
conception
this
theory
then
takes
its
origin
from
the
criticism
of
the
loftiest
of
all
the
other
doctrines
of
aesthetic
from
the
criticism
of
mystical
or
romantic
aesthetic
and
contains
in
itself
the
criticism
and
the
truth
of
all
the
other
aesthetics
it
is
not
here
possible
to
allow
ourselves
to
illustrate
its
other
aspects
such
as
would
be
those
of
the
identity
which
it
lays
down
between
intuition
and
expression
between
art
and
language
suffice
it
to
say
as
regards
the
former
that
he
alone
who
divides
the
unity
of
the
spirit
into
soul
and
body
can
have
faith
in
a
pure
act
of
the
soul
and
therefore
in
an
intuition
which
should
exist
as
an
intuition
and
yet
be
without
its
body
expression
expression
is
the
actuality
of
intuition
as
action
is
of
will
and
in
the
same
way
as
will
not
exercised
in
action
is
not
will
so
an
intuition
unexpressed
is
not
an
intuition
as
regards
the
second
point
i
will
mention
in
passing
that
in
order
to
recognize
the
identity
of
art
and
language
it
is
needful
to
study
language
not
in
its
abstraction
and
in
grammatical
detail
but
in
its
immediate
reality
and
in
all
its
manifestations
spoken
and
sung
phonic
and
graphic
and
we
should
not
take
at
hazard
any
proposition
and
declare
it
to
be
aesthetic
because
if
all
propositions
have
an
aesthetic
side
precisely
because
intuition
is
the
elementary
form
of
knowledge
and
is
as
it
were
the
garment
of
the
superior
and
more
complex
forms
all
are
not
aesthetic
but
some
are
philosophical
historical
scientific
or
mathematical
some
in
fact
of
these
are
more
than
aesthetic
or
logical
they
are
aestheticological
aristotle
in
his
time
distinguished
between
semantic
and
apophantic
propositions
and
noted
that
if
all
propositions
be
not
all
are
language
is
art
not
in
so
far
as
it
is
apophantic
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
generically
semantic
it
is
necessary
to
note
in
it
the
side
by
which
it
is
expressive
and
nothing
but
expressive
it
is
also
well
to
observe
though
this
may
seem
superfluous
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reduce
the
theory
of
pure
intuition
as
has
been
sometimes
done
to
a
historical
fact
or
to
a
psychological
concept
because
we
recognize
in
poetry
as
it
were
the
ingenuousness
the
freshness
the
barbarity
of
the
spirit
it
is
not
therefore
necessary
to
limit
poetry
to
youth
and
to
barbarian
peoples
though
we
recognize
language
as
the
first
act
of
taking
possession
of
the
world
achieved
by
man
we
must
not
imagine
that
language
is
born
once
only
in
the
course
of
the
ages
and
that
later
generations
merely
adopt
the
ancient
instrument
applying
it
to
a
new
order
of
things
while
lamenting
its
slight
adaptability
to
the
usage
of
civilized
times
art
poetry
intuition
and
immediate
expression
are
the
moment
of
barbarity
and
of
ingenuousness
which
perpetually
recur
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
they
are
youth
that
is
not
chronological
but
ideal
there
exist
very
prosaic
barbarians
and
very
prosaic
youths
as
there
exist
poetical
spirits
of
the
utmost
refinement
and
civilization
the
mythology
of
those
proud
gigantic
patagonians
of
whom
our
vico
was
wont
to
discourse
or
of
those
who
were
lately
a
theme
of
conversation
must
be
looked
upon
as
for
ever
superseded
but
there
arises
an
apparently
very
serious
objection
to
the
aesthetic
of
pure
intuition
giving
occasion
to
doubt
whether
this
doctrine
if
it
represent
progress
in
respect
to
the
doctrines
which
have
preceded
it
yet
is
also
a
complete
and
definite
doctrine
as
regards
the
fundamental
concept
of
art
should
it
be
submitted
to
a
dialectic
by
means
of
which
it
must
be
surpassed
and
dissolved
into
a
more
lofty
point
of
view
the
doctrine
of
pure
intuition
makes
the
value
of
art
to
consist
of
its
power
of
intuition
in
such
a
manner
that
just
in
so
far
as
pure
and
concrete
intuitions
are
achieved
will
art
and
beauty
be
achieved
but
if
attention
be
paid
to
judgments
of
people
of
good
taste
and
of
critics
and
to
what
we
all
say
when
we
are
warmly
discussing
works
of
art
and
manifesting
our
praise
or
blame
of
them
it
would
seem
that
what
we
seek
in
art
is
something
quite
different
or
at
least
something
more
than
simple
force
and
intuitive
and
expressive
purity
what
pleases
and
what
is
sought
in
art
what
makes
beat
the
heart
and
enraptures
the
admiration
is
life
movement
emotion
warmth
the
feeling
of
the
artist
this
alone
affords
the
supreme
criterion
for
distinguishing
true
from
false
works
of
art
those
with
insight
from
the
failures
where
there
are
emotion
and
feeling
much
is
forgiven
where
they
are
wanting
nothing
can
make
up
for
them
not
only
are
the
most
profound
thoughts
and
the
most
exquisite
culture
incapable
of
saving
a
work
of
art
which
is
looked
upon
as
but
richness
of
imagery
ability
and
certainty
in
the
reproduction
of
the
real
in
description
characterization
and
composition
and
all
other
knowledge
only
serve
to
arouse
the
regret
that
so
great
a
price
has
been
paid
and
such
labours
endured
in
vain
we
do
not
ask
of
an
artist
instruction
as
to
real
facts
and
thoughts
nor
that
he
should
astonish
us
with
the
richness
of
his
imagination
but
that
he
should
have
a
in
contact
with
which
the
soul
of
the
hearer
or
spectator
may
be
heated
a
personality
of
any
sort
is
asked
for
in
this
case
its
moral
significance
is
excluded
let
it
be
sad
or
glad
enthusiastic
or
distrustful
sentimental
or
sarcastic
benignant
or
malign
but
it
must
be
a
soul
art
criticism
would
seem
to
consist
altogether
in
determining
if
there
be
a
personality
in
the
work
of
art
and
of
what
sort
a
work
that
is
a
failure
is
an
incoherent
work
that
is
to
say
a
work
in
which
no
single
personality
appears
but
a
number
of
disaggregated
and
jostling
personalities
that
is
really
none
there
is
no
further
correct
significance
than
this
in
the
researches
that
are
made
as
to
the
verisimilitude
the
truth
the
logic
the
necessity
of
a
work
of
art
it
is
true
that
many
protests
have
been
made
by
artists
critics
and
philosophers
by
profession
against
the
characteristic
of
it
has
been
maintained
that
the
bad
artist
leaves
traces
of
his
personality
in
the
work
of
art
whereas
the
great
artist
cancels
them
all
it
has
been
further
maintained
that
the
artist
should
portray
the
reality
of
life
and
that
he
should
not
disturb
it
with
the
opinions
judgments
and
personal
feelings
of
the
author
and
that
the
artist
should
give
the
tears
of
things
and
not
his
own
tears
hence
not
personality
has
been
proclaimed
to
be
the
characteristic
of
art
that
is
to
say
the
very
opposite
however
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
show
that
what
is
really
meant
by
this
opposing
formula
is
the
same
as
in
the
first
case
the
theory
of
impersonality
really
coincides
with
that
of
personality
in
every
point
the
opposition
of
the
artists
critics
and
philosophers
above
mentioned
was
directed
against
the
invasion
by
the
empirical
and
volitional
personality
of
the
artist
of
the
spontaneous
and
ideal
personality
which
constitutes
the
subject
of
the
work
of
art
for
instance
artists
who
do
not
succeed
in
representing
the
force
of
piety
or
of
love
of
country
add
to
their
colourless
imaginings
declamation
or
theatrical
effects
thinking
thus
to
arouse
such
feelings
in
like
manner
certain
orators
and
actors
introduce
into
a
work
of
art
an
emotion
extraneous
to
the
work
of
art
itself
within
these
limits
the
opposition
of
the
upholders
of
the
theory
of
impersonality
was
most
reasonable
on
the
other
hand
there
has
also
been
exhibited
an
altogether
irrational
opposition
to
personality
in
the
work
of
art
such
is
the
lack
of
comprehension
and
intolerance
evinced
by
certain
souls
for
others
differently
constituted
of
calm
for
agitated
souls
for
example
here
we
find
at
bottom
the
claim
of
one
sort
of
personality
to
deny
that
of
another
finally
it
has
been
possible
to
demonstrate
from
among
the
examples
given
of
impersonal
art
in
the
romances
and
dramas
called
naturalistic
that
in
so
far
and
to
the
extent
that
these
are
complete
artistic
works
they
possess
personality
this
holds
good
even
when
this
personality
lies
in
a
wandering
or
perplexity
of
thought
regarding
the
value
to
be
given
to
life
or
in
blind
faith
in
the
natural
sciences
and
in
modern
sociology
where
every
trace
of
personality
was
really
absent
and
its
place
taken
by
the
pedantic
quest
for
human
documents
the
description
of
certain
social
classes
and
the
generic
or
individual
process
of
certain
maladies
there
the
work
of
art
was
absent
a
work
of
science
of
more
or
less
superficiality
and
without
the
necessary
proofs
and
control
filled
its
place
there
is
no
upholder
of
impersonality
but
experiences
a
feeling
of
fatigue
for
a
work
of
the
utmost
exactitude
in
the
reproduction
of
reality
in
its
empirical
sequence
or
of
industrious
and
apathetic
combination
of
images
he
asks
himself
why
such
a
work
was
executed
and
recommends
the
author
to
adopt
some
other
profession
since
that
of
artist
was
not
intended
for
him
thus
it
is
without
doubt
that
if
pure
intuition
and
pure
expression
which
is
the
same
thing
are
indispensable
in
the
work
of
art
the
personality
of
the
artist
is
equally
indispensable
if
to
quote
the
celebrated
words
in
our
own
way
the
moment
of
perfect
representation
or
expression
be
necessary
for
the
work
of
art
the
moment
of
feeling
is
not
less
necessary
poetry
or
art
in
general
can
not
be
exclusively
or
it
must
be
both
ingenuous
and
sentimental
and
if
the
first
or
representative
moment
be
termed
and
the
second
which
is
sentimental
passionate
and
personal
be
termed
then
poetry
and
art
must
be
at
once
epic
and
lyric
or
if
it
please
you
better
we
use
these
words
here
not
at
all
in
their
empirical
and
intellectualist
sense
as
employed
to
designate
special
classes
of
works
of
art
exclusive
of
other
classes
but
in
that
of
elements
or
moments
which
must
of
necessity
be
found
united
in
every
work
of
art
how
diverse
soever
it
may
be
in
other
respects
now
this
irrefutable
conclusion
seems
to
constitute
exactly
that
apparently
serious
objection
to
the
doctrine
which
defines
art
as
pure
intuition
but
if
the
essence
of
art
be
merely
theoretic
and
it
is
can
it
on
the
other
hand
be
practical
that
is
to
say
feeling
personality
and
or
if
it
be
practical
how
can
it
be
theoretic
it
will
be
answered
that
feeling
is
the
intuibility
the
but
form
and
content
do
not
in
philosophy
constitute
a
duality
like
water
and
its
recipient
in
philosophy
content
is
form
and
form
is
content
here
on
the
other
hand
form
and
content
appear
to
be
different
from
one
another
the
content
is
of
one
quality
the
form
of
another
thus
art
appears
to
be
the
sum
of
two
qualities
or
as
herbart
used
to
say
in
his
time
of
accordingly
we
have
an
altogether
unmaintainable
aesthetic
as
is
clear
from
recent
largely
vulgarized
doctrines
of
aesthetic
as
operating
with
the
concept
of
the
here
we
find
on
the
one
hand
things
intuible
lying
dead
and
soulless
on
the
other
the
artist
feeling
and
personality
the
artist
is
then
supposed
to
put
himself
into
things
by
an
act
of
magic
to
make
them
live
and
palpitate
love
and
adore
but
if
we
start
with
the
we
can
never
again
reach
the
distinction
requires
an
intellectual
act
and
what
the
intellect
has
divided
intellect
or
reason
alone
not
art
or
imagination
can
reunite
and
synthetize
thus
the
aesthetic
of
infusion
or
transfusion
when
it
does
not
fall
into
the
antiquated
hedonistic
doctrines
of
agreeable
illusion
of
games
and
generally
of
what
affords
a
pleasurable
emotion
or
of
moral
doctrines
where
art
is
a
symbol
and
an
allegory
of
the
good
and
the
true
is
yet
not
able
despite
its
airs
of
modernity
and
its
psychology
to
escape
the
fate
of
the
doctrine
which
makes
of
art
a
conception
of
the
world
like
religion
the
process
that
it
describes
is
mythological
not
aesthetic
it
is
a
making
of
gods
or
of
idols
to
make
one
gods
is
an
unhappy
art
said
an
old
italian
poet
but
if
it
be
not
unhappy
certainly
it
is
not
poetic
and
not
aesthetic
the
artist
does
not
make
the
gods
because
he
has
other
things
to
do
another
reason
is
that
to
tell
the
truth
he
is
so
ingenuous
and
so
absorbed
in
the
image
that
attracts
him
that
he
can
not
perform
that
act
of
abstraction
and
conception
wherein
the
image
must
be
surpassed
and
made
the
allegory
of
a
universal
though
it
be
of
the
crudest
description
this
recent
theory
then
is
of
no
use
it
leads
back
to
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
admission
of
two
characteristics
of
art
and
not
unified
we
must
recognize
either
that
the
duality
must
be
destroyed
and
proved
illusory
that
we
must
proceed
to
a
more
ample
conception
of
art
in
which
that
of
pure
intuibility
would
remain
merely
secondary
or
particular
and
to
destroy
and
prove
it
illusory
must
consist
in
showing
that
here
too
form
is
content
and
that
pure
intuition
is
lyricism
now
the
truth
is
precisely
this
intuition
is
essentially
all
the
difficulties
concerning
this
question
arise
from
not
having
thoroughly
understood
that
concept
from
having
failed
to
penetrate
its
true
nature
and
to
explore
its
multiple
relations
when
we
consider
the
one
attentively
we
see
the
other
bursting
from
its
bosom
or
better
the
one
and
the
other
reveal
themselves
as
one
and
the
same
and
we
escape
from
the
desperate
trilemma
of
either
denying
the
lyrical
and
personal
character
of
art
or
of
asserting
that
it
is
adjunctive
external
and
accidental
or
of
excogitating
a
new
doctrine
of
aesthetic
which
we
do
not
know
where
to
find
in
fact
as
has
already
been
remarked
what
can
pure
intuition
mean
but
intuition
pure
of
every
abstraction
of
every
conceptual
element
and
for
this
reason
neither
science
history
nor
philosophy
this
means
that
the
content
of
the
pure
intuition
can
not
be
either
an
abstract
concept
or
a
speculative
concept
or
idea
or
a
conceptualized
that
is
historicized
representation
nor
can
it
be
a
perception
which
is
a
representation
intellectually
and
so
historically
discriminated
but
outside
logic
in
its
various
forms
and
blendings
no
other
psychic
content
remains
save
that
which
is
called
appetites
tendencies
feelings
and
will
these
things
are
all
the
same
and
constitute
the
practical
form
of
the
spirit
in
its
infinite
gradations
and
in
its
dialectic
pleasure
and
pain
pure
intuition
then
since
it
does
not
produce
concepts
must
represent
the
will
in
its
manifestations
that
is
to
say
it
can
represent
nothing
but
of
the
and
states
of
the
soul
are
passionality
feeling
personality
which
are
found
in
every
art
and
determine
its
lyrical
character
where
this
is
absent
art
is
absent
because
pure
intuition
is
and
we
have
at
the
most
in
exchange
for
it
philosophical
historical
or
scientific
in
the
last
of
these
passion
is
represented
not
immediately
but
mediately
or
to
speak
exactly
it
is
no
longer
represented
but
thought
thus
the
origin
of
language
that
is
its
true
nature
has
several
times
been
placed
in
thus
too
aristotle
when
he
wished
to
give
an
example
of
those
propositions
which
were
not
but
generically
we
should
say
not
logical
but
purely
aesthetic
and
did
not
predicate
the
logically
true
and
false
but
nevertheless
said
something
gave
as
example
invocation
or
prayer
he
added
that
these
propositions
do
not
appertain
to
logic
but
to
rhetoric
and
poetic
a
landscape
is
a
state
of
the
soul
a
great
poem
may
all
be
contained
in
an
exclamation
of
joy
of
sorrow
of
admiration
or
of
lament
the
more
objective
is
a
work
of
art
by
so
much
the
more
is
it
poetically
suggestive
if
this
deduction
of
lyricism
from
the
intimate
essence
of
pure
intuition
do
not
appear
easily
acceptable
the
reason
is
to
be
sought
in
two
very
prejudices
of
which
it
is
useful
to
indicate
here
the
genesis
the
first
concerns
the
nature
of
the
and
its
likenesses
to
and
differences
from
imagination
and
fancy
have
been
clearly
distinguished
thus
by
certain
aestheticians
and
among
them
de
sanctis
as
also
in
discussions
relating
to
concrete
art
they
have
held
fancy
not
imagination
to
be
the
special
faculty
of
the
poet
and
the
artist
not
only
does
a
new
and
bizarre
combination
of
images
which
is
vulgarly
called
not
constitute
the
artist
but
fait
rien
à
as
alceste
remarked
with
reference
to
the
length
of
time
expended
upon
writing
a
sonnet
great
artists
have
often
preferred
to
treat
groups
of
images
which
had
already
been
many
times
used
as
material
for
works
of
art
the
novelty
of
these
new
works
has
been
solely
that
of
art
or
form
that
is
to
say
of
the
new
which
they
have
known
how
to
give
to
the
old
material
of
the
new
way
in
which
they
have
and
therefore
it
thus
creating
upon
the
old
ones
these
remarks
are
all
obvious
and
universally
recognized
as
true
but
if
mere
imagination
as
such
has
been
excluded
from
art
it
has
not
therefore
been
excluded
from
the
theoretic
spirit
hence
the
disinclination
to
admit
that
a
pure
intuition
must
of
necessity
express
a
state
of
the
soul
whereas
it
may
also
consist
as
they
believe
of
a
pure
image
without
a
content
of
feeling
if
we
form
an
arbitrary
image
of
any
sort
pede
in
say
of
a
head
on
a
horse
body
would
not
this
be
an
intuition
a
pure
intuition
certainly
quite
without
any
content
of
reflexion
would
one
not
attain
to
a
work
of
art
in
this
way
or
at
any
rate
to
an
artistic
motive
certainly
not
for
the
image
given
as
an
instance
and
every
other
image
that
may
be
produced
by
the
imagination
not
only
is
not
a
pure
intuition
but
it
is
not
a
product
of
any
sort
it
is
a
product
of
as
was
observed
in
the
formula
used
by
our
opponents
and
choice
is
external
to
the
world
of
thought
and
contemplation
it
may
be
said
that
imagination
is
a
practical
artifice
or
game
played
upon
that
patrimony
of
images
possessed
by
the
soul
whereas
the
fancy
the
translation
of
practical
into
theoretical
values
of
states
of
the
soul
into
images
is
the
of
that
patrimony
itself
from
this
we
learn
that
an
image
which
is
not
the
expression
of
a
state
of
the
soul
is
not
an
image
since
it
is
without
any
theoretical
value
and
therefore
it
can
not
be
an
obstacle
to
the
identification
of
lyricism
and
intuition
but
the
other
prejudice
is
more
difficult
to
eradicate
because
it
is
bound
up
with
the
metaphysical
problem
itself
on
the
various
solutions
of
which
depend
the
various
solutions
of
the
aesthetic
problem
and
if
art
be
intuition
would
it
therefore
be
any
intuition
that
one
might
have
of
a
object
appertaining
to
if
i
open
my
eyes
and
look
at
the
first
object
that
they
fall
upon
a
chair
or
a
table
a
mountain
or
a
river
shall
i
have
performed
by
so
doing
an
aesthetic
act
if
so
what
becomes
of
the
lyrical
character
of
which
we
have
asserted
the
necessity
if
not
what
becomes
of
the
intuitive
character
of
which
we
have
affirmed
the
equal
necessity
and
also
its
identity
with
the
former
without
doubt
the
perception
of
a
physical
object
as
such
does
not
constitute
an
artistic
fact
but
precisely
for
the
reason
that
it
is
not
a
pure
intuition
but
a
judgment
of
perception
and
implies
the
application
of
an
abstract
concept
which
in
this
case
is
physical
or
belonging
to
external
nature
and
with
this
reflexion
and
perception
we
find
ourselves
at
once
outside
the
domain
of
pure
intuition
we
could
have
a
pure
perception
of
a
physical
object
in
one
way
only
that
is
to
say
if
physical
or
external
nature
were
a
metaphysical
reality
a
truly
real
reality
and
not
as
it
is
a
construction
or
abstraction
of
the
intellect
if
such
were
the
case
man
would
have
an
immediate
intuition
in
his
first
theoretical
moment
both
of
himself
and
of
external
nature
of
the
spiritual
and
of
the
physical
in
an
equal
degree
this
represents
the
dualistic
hypothesis
but
just
as
dualism
is
incapable
of
providing
a
coherent
system
of
philosophy
so
is
it
incapable
of
providing
a
coherent
aesthetic
if
we
admit
dualism
we
must
certainly
abandon
the
doctrine
of
art
as
pure
intuition
but
we
must
at
the
same
time
abandon
all
philosophy
but
art
on
its
side
tacitly
protests
against
metaphysical
dualism
it
does
so
because
being
the
most
immediate
form
of
knowledge
it
is
in
contact
with
activity
not
with
passivity
with
interiority
not
exteriority
with
spirit
not
with
matter
and
never
with
a
double
order
of
reality
those
who
affirm
the
existence
of
two
forms
of
intuition
the
one
external
or
physical
the
other
subjective
or
aesthetic
the
one
cold
and
inanimate
the
other
warm
and
lively
the
one
imposed
from
without
the
other
coming
from
the
inner
soul
attain
without
doubt
to
the
distinctions
and
oppositions
of
the
vulgar
or
dualistic
consciousness
but
their
aesthetic
is
vulgar
the
lyrical
essence
of
pure
intuition
and
of
art
helps
to
make
clear
what
we
have
already
observed
concerning
the
persistence
of
the
intuition
and
of
the
fancy
in
the
higher
grades
of
the
theoretical
spirit
why
philosophy
history
and
science
have
always
an
artistic
side
and
why
their
expression
is
subject
to
aesthetic
valuation
the
man
who
ascends
from
art
to
thought
does
not
by
so
doing
abandon
his
volitional
and
practical
base
and
therefore
he
too
finds
himself
in
a
particular
of
the
the
representation
of
which
is
intuitive
and
lyrical
and
accompanies
of
necessity
the
development
of
his
ideas
hence
the
various
styles
of
thinkers
solemn
or
jocose
troubled
or
gladsome
mysterious
and
involved
or
level
and
expansive
but
it
would
not
be
correct
to
divide
intuition
immediately
into
two
classes
the
one
of
the
other
of
or
intuitions
owing
to
the
persistence
of
the
artistic
element
in
logical
thought
because
the
relation
of
degrees
is
not
the
relation
of
classes
and
copper
is
copper
whether
it
be
found
alone
or
in
combination
as
bronze
further
this
close
connection
of
feeling
and
intuition
in
pure
intuition
throws
much
light
on
the
reasons
which
have
so
often
caused
art
to
be
separated
from
the
theoretic
and
confounded
with
the
practical
activity
the
most
celebrated
of
these
confusions
are
those
formulated
about
the
relativity
of
tastes
and
of
the
impossibility
of
reproducing
tasting
and
correctly
judging
the
art
of
the
past
and
in
general
the
art
of
others
a
life
lived
a
feeling
felt
a
volition
willed
are
certainly
impossible
to
reproduce
because
nothing
happens
more
than
once
and
my
situation
at
the
present
moment
is
not
that
of
any
other
being
nor
is
it
mine
of
the
moment
before
nor
will
be
of
the
moment
to
follow
but
art
remakes
ideally
and
ideally
expresses
my
momentary
situation
its
image
produced
by
art
becomes
separated
from
time
and
space
and
can
be
again
made
and
again
contemplated
in
its
from
every
point
of
time
and
space
it
belongs
not
to
the
but
to
the
not
to
the
flying
moment
but
to
eternity
thus
life
passes
but
art
endures
finally
we
obtain
from
this
relation
between
the
intuition
and
the
state
of
the
soul
the
criterion
of
exact
definition
of
the
required
of
artists
which
is
itself
also
an
essential
request
it
is
essential
precisely
because
it
means
that
the
artist
must
have
a
state
of
the
soul
to
express
which
really
amounts
to
saying
that
he
must
be
an
artist
his
must
be
a
state
of
the
soul
really
experienced
not
merely
imagined
because
imagination
as
we
know
is
not
a
work
of
truth
but
on
the
other
hand
the
demand
for
sincerity
does
not
go
beyond
asking
for
a
state
of
the
soul
and
that
the
state
of
soul
expressed
in
the
work
of
art
be
a
desire
or
an
action
it
is
altogether
indifferent
to
aesthetic
whether
the
artist
have
had
only
an
aspiration
or
have
realized
that
aspiration
in
his
empirical
life
all
that
is
quite
indifferent
in
the
sphere
of
art
here
we
also
find
the
confutation
of
that
false
conception
of
sincerity
which
maintains
that
the
artist
in
his
volitional
or
practical
life
should
be
at
one
with
his
dream
or
with
his
incubus
whether
or
no
he
have
been
so
is
a
matter
that
interests
his
biographer
not
his
critic
it
belongs
to
history
which
separates
and
qualifies
that
which
art
does
not
discriminate
but
represents
iii
this
attitude
of
indiscrimination
and
indifference
observed
by
art
in
respect
to
history
and
philosophy
is
also
foreshadowed
at
that
place
of
the
to
which
we
have
already
referred
to
obtain
thence
the
confirmation
of
the
thesis
of
the
identity
of
art
and
language
and
another
confirmation
that
of
the
identity
of
lyric
and
pure
intuition
it
is
a
really
admirable
passage
containing
many
profound
truths
in
a
few
short
simple
words
although
as
is
natural
without
full
consciousness
of
their
richness
aristotle
then
is
still
discussing
the
said
rhetorical
and
poetical
propositions
semantic
and
not
apophantic
and
he
remarks
that
in
them
there
rules
no
distinction
between
true
and
false
alaetheueion
hae
pseudeothai
ouk
art
in
fact
is
in
contact
with
palpitating
reality
but
does
not
know
that
it
is
so
in
contact
and
therefore
is
not
truly
in
contact
art
does
not
allow
itself
to
be
troubled
with
the
abstractions
of
the
intellect
and
therefore
does
not
make
mistakes
but
it
does
not
know
that
it
does
not
make
mistakes
if
art
then
to
return
to
what
we
said
at
the
beginning
be
the
first
and
most
ingenuous
form
of
knowledge
it
can
not
give
complete
satisfaction
to
man
need
to
know
and
therefore
can
not
be
the
ultimate
end
of
the
theoretic
spirit
art
is
the
dream
of
the
life
of
knowledge
its
complement
is
waking
lyricism
no
longer
but
the
concept
no
longer
the
dream
but
the
judgment
thought
could
not
be
without
fancy
but
thought
surpasses
and
contains
in
itself
the
fancy
transforms
the
image
into
perception
and
gives
to
the
world
of
dream
the
clear
distinctions
and
the
firm
contours
of
reality
art
can
not
achieve
this
and
however
great
be
our
love
of
art
that
can
not
raise
it
in
rank
any
more
than
the
love
one
may
have
for
a
beautiful
child
can
convert
it
into
an
adult
we
must
accept
the
child
as
a
child
the
adult
as
an
adult
therefore
the
aesthetic
of
pure
intuition
while
it
proclaims
energetically
the
autonomy
of
art
and
of
the
aesthetic
activity
is
at
the
same
time
averse
to
all
that
is
to
every
attempt
at
lowering
the
life
of
thought
in
order
to
elevate
that
of
fancy
the
origin
of
aestheticism
is
the
same
as
that
of
mysticism
both
proceed
from
a
rebellion
against
the
predominance
of
the
abstract
sciences
and
against
the
undue
abuse
of
the
principle
of
causation
in
metaphysic
when
we
pass
from
the
stuffed
animals
of
the
zoological
museums
from
anatomical
reconstructions
from
tables
of
figures
from
classes
and
constituted
by
means
of
abstract
characters
or
from
the
fixation
and
mechanization
of
life
for
the
ends
of
naturalistic
science
to
the
pages
of
the
poets
to
the
pictures
of
the
painters
to
the
melodies
of
the
composers
when
in
fact
we
look
upon
life
with
the
eye
of
the
artist
we
have
the
impression
that
we
are
passing
from
death
to
life
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
from
fiction
to
reality
we
are
inclined
to
proclaim
that
only
in
art
and
in
aesthetic
contemplation
is
truth
and
that
science
is
either
charlatanesque
pedantry
or
a
modest
practical
expedient
and
certainly
art
has
the
superiority
of
its
own
truth
simple
small
and
elementary
though
it
be
over
the
abstract
which
as
such
is
altogether
without
truth
but
in
violently
rejecting
science
and
frantically
embracing
art
that
very
form
of
the
theoretic
spirit
is
forgotten
by
means
of
which
we
can
criticize
science
and
recognize
the
nature
of
art
now
this
theoretic
spirit
since
it
criticizes
science
is
not
science
and
as
reflective
consciousness
of
art
is
not
art
philosophy
the
supreme
fact
of
the
theoretic
world
is
forgotten
this
error
has
been
renewed
in
our
day
because
the
consciousness
of
the
limits
of
the
natural
sciences
and
of
the
value
of
the
truth
which
belongs
to
intuition
and
to
art
have
been
renewed
but
just
as
a
century
ago
during
the
idealistic
and
romantic
period
there
were
some
who
reminded
the
fanatics
for
art
and
the
artists
who
were
transforming
philosophy
that
art
was
not
the
most
lofty
form
of
apprehending
the
absolute
so
in
our
day
it
is
necessary
to
awaken
the
consciousness
of
thought
and
one
of
the
means
for
attaining
this
end
is
an
exact
understanding
of
the
limits
of
art
that
is
the
construction
of
a
solid
aesthetic
the
end
