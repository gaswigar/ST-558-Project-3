parker
walked
through
the
dimly
lighted
newsroom
of
the
her
rubber
heels
making
no
sound
on
the
bare
freshly
scrubbed
floor
desks
were
deserted
for
the
final
night
edition
of
the
paper
had
gone
to
press
half
an
hour
earlier
and
only
the
cleaning
women
were
at
work
one
of
the
women
arrested
a
long
sweep
of
her
mop
just
in
time
to
avoid
splashing
the
girl
with
water
i
sorry
she
apologized
in
her
best
broken
english
i
no
look
for
someone
to
come
so
very
late
oh
curfew
never
rings
for
me
penny
laughed
side
stepping
a
puddle
of
water
i
likely
to
be
abroad
at
any
hour
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
room
a
light
glowed
behind
a
frosted
glass
door
marked
anthony
parker
editor
there
the
girl
paused
and
seeing
her
father
grotesque
shadow
opened
the
door
a
tiny
crack
to
rumble
in
a
deep
voice
hands
up
i
have
you
covered
taken
by
surprise
parker
swung
quickly
around
his
swivel
chair
squeaking
a
loud
protest
penny
i
wish
you
would
do
that
he
exclaimed
you
know
it
always
makes
me
jump
sorry
dad
penny
grinned
slumping
into
a
leather
chair
beside
her
father
desk
a
girl
has
to
have
some
amusement
you
know
did
three
hours
at
the
moving
picture
theatre
satisfy
you
oh
the
show
was
worse
than
awful
by
the
way
here
something
for
you
removing
a
sealed
yellow
envelope
from
her
purse
penny
flipped
it
carelessly
across
the
desk
i
met
a
western
union
boy
downstairs
she
explained
he
was
looking
for
you
i
paid
for
the
message
and
saved
him
a
trip
upstairs
two
dollars
and
ten
cents
if
you
do
mind
absently
parker
took
two
crisp
dollar
bills
from
his
pocket
and
reached
for
the
telegram
do
forget
the
dime
penny
reminded
him
it
may
seem
a
trifle
to
you
but
not
to
a
girl
who
has
to
live
on
a
weekly
allowance
for
lack
of
change
the
editor
tossed
over
a
quarter
which
his
daughter
pocketed
with
deep
satisfaction
ripping
open
the
envelope
he
scanned
the
telegram
but
as
he
read
his
face
darkened
why
dad
what
wrong
penny
asked
in
surprise
parker
crumpled
the
sheet
into
a
round
ball
and
hurled
it
toward
the
waste
paper
basket
your
aim
gets
worse
every
day
penny
chuckled
stooping
to
retrieve
the
paper
smoothing
the
corrugations
she
read
aloud
your
editorial
of
the
press
in
thursday
star
thoroughly
disgusted
this
reader
what
your
cheap
paper
needs
is
a
little
less
freedom
and
more
decency
if
our
forefathers
could
have
foreseen
the
yellow
press
of
today
they
would
have
regulated
it
not
made
it
free
why
do
you
take
that
american
flag
off
your
masthead
and
substitute
a
cash
register
fly
your
true
colors
and
the
parker
brand
of
hypocrisy
stop
it
do
read
another
line
the
editor
commanded
before
penny
had
half
finished
why
dad
you
poor
old
wounded
lion
she
chided
blue
eyes
dancing
with
mischief
i
thought
you
prided
yourself
that
uncomplimentary
opinions
never
disturbed
you
ca
you
take
it
any
more
i
do
mind
a
few
insults
parker
snapped
but
paying
for
them
is
another
matter
that
so
this
little
gem
of
literature
did
set
you
back
two
dollars
and
ten
cents
lucky
i
collected
before
you
opened
the
telegram
parker
slammed
his
desk
shut
with
a
force
which
rattled
the
office
windows
this
same
who
signs
himself
reader
or
bowman
or
whatever
name
suits
his
fancy
has
sent
me
six
telegrams
in
the
past
month
i
getting
fed
up
all
of
the
messages
collect
every
one
the
has
criticised
everything
from
the
comic
strips
to
the
advertising
columns
i
had
enough
of
it
then
why
not
do
something
about
it
penny
asked
soothingly
refuse
the
telegrams
it
not
that
easy
the
editor
growled
each
day
the
receives
a
large
number
of
messages
hot
news
tips
from
correspondents
and
from
reporters
who
try
to
sell
free
lance
stories
we
glad
to
pay
for
these
telegrams
this
fellow
who
keeps
bombarding
us
is
just
smart
enough
to
use
different
names
and
send
his
wires
from
various
places
sometimes
he
addresses
the
telegrams
to
me
and
then
perhaps
to
city
editor
dewitt
or
one
of
the
other
staff
members
in
that
case
i
afraid
you
out
of
luck
penny
said
teasingly
how
about
drowning
your
troubles
in
a
little
sleep
it
is
late
parker
admitted
glancing
at
his
watch
almost
midnight
time
we
starting
home
reaching
for
his
hat
parker
switched
off
the
light
locked
the
door
and
followed
penny
down
the
stairway
to
the
street
at
the
parking
lot
opposite
the
building
he
tramped
about
restlessly
while
waiting
for
an
attendant
to
bring
the
car
i
drive
penny
said
sliding
behind
the
steering
wheel
in
your
present
mood
you
might
inadvertently
pick
off
a
few
pedestrians
it
makes
my
blood
boil
parker
muttered
his
thoughts
reverting
to
the
telegram
call
my
paper
yellow
eh
and
that
crack
about
the
cash
register
oh
everyone
knows
the
is
the
best
paper
in
the
state
penny
said
trying
to
coax
him
into
a
better
mood
you
a
good
editor
too
and
a
pretty
fair
father
thanks
parker
responded
with
a
mock
bow
since
we
passing
out
compliments
you
not
so
bad
yourself
suddenly
relaxing
he
reached
out
to
touch
penny
hand
in
a
rare
expression
of
affection
tall
and
lean
a
newspaper
man
with
a
reputation
for
courage
and
fight
he
had
only
two
interests
in
life
his
paper
and
his
daughter
penny
mother
had
been
dead
many
years
but
at
times
he
saw
his
wife
again
in
the
girl
sparkling
blue
eyes
golden
hair
and
especially
in
the
way
she
smiled
hungry
dad
penny
asked
unexpectedly
intruding
upon
his
thoughts
i
know
a
dandy
new
hamburger
place
not
far
from
here
wonderful
coffee
too
well
all
right
parker
consented
it
pretty
late
though
the
big
clock
striking
midnight
as
the
car
halted
for
a
traffic
light
they
both
listened
to
the
musical
chimes
which
preceded
the
regularly
spaced
strokes
of
the
giant
clock
penny
turned
her
head
to
gaze
at
the
hubell
memorial
tower
a
grim
stone
building
which
rose
to
the
height
of
feet
erected
ten
years
before
as
a
monument
to
one
of
riverview
wealthy
citizens
its
chimes
could
be
heard
for
nearly
a
mile
on
a
still
night
on
one
side
its
high
narrow
windows
overlooked
the
city
while
on
the
other
the
cultivated
lands
of
truck
farmers
how
strange
penny
murmured
as
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
died
away
what
is
strange
parker
asked
gruffly
why
that
clock
struck
thirteen
times
instead
of
twelve
bunk
and
bosh
oh
but
it
did
penny
earnestly
insisted
i
counted
each
stroke
distinctly
and
one
of
them
twice
scoffed
her
father
or
are
you
spoofing
your
old
dad
oh
i
not
penny
maintained
as
the
car
moved
ahead
she
craned
her
neck
to
stare
up
at
the
stone
tower
i
know
i
counted
thirteen
why
dad
there
a
green
light
burning
in
one
of
the
windows
i
never
saw
that
before
what
can
it
mean
it
means
we
have
a
wreck
unless
you
watch
the
road
parker
cried
giving
the
steering
wheel
a
quick
turn
where
are
you
taking
me
anyhow
out
to
toni
reluctantly
penny
centered
her
full
attention
upon
the
highway
it
only
a
mile
into
the
country
we
wo
be
home
before
one
parker
complained
but
since
we
this
far
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
keep
on
dad
about
that
light
penny
said
thoughtfully
did
you
ever
notice
it
before
parker
turned
to
gaze
back
toward
the
stone
tower
there
no
green
light
he
answered
grimly
every
window
is
dark
but
i
saw
it
only
an
instant
ago
and
i
did
hear
the
clock
strike
thirteen
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
never
mind
the
dramatics
parker
cut
in
if
the
clock
struck
an
extra
time
which
it
did
something
could
have
gone
wrong
with
the
mechanism
do
try
to
build
up
a
mystery
out
of
your
imagination
the
car
rattled
over
a
bridge
and
passed
a
deserted
farm
house
that
formerly
had
belonged
to
a
queer
old
man
named
peter
fenestra
gaze
fastened
momentarily
upon
an
old
fashioned
storm
cellar
which
marred
the
appearance
of
the
front
yard
i
suppose
i
imagined
all
that
too
she
said
waving
her
hand
toward
the
disfiguring
cement
hump
old
peter
never
had
any
hidden
gold
he
never
had
a
secret
pact
with
tattooed
sailors
and
he
never
tried
to
burn
your
newspaper
plant
i
admit
you
did
a
nice
piece
of
detective
work
when
you
uncovered
that
story
her
father
acknowledged
likewise
you
brought
the
one
of
its
best
scoops
by
outwitting
slippery
al
gepper
and
entangling
him
in
his
own
do
forget
the
of
the
witch
either
penny
reminded
him
you
laughed
at
me
then
just
as
you
doing
now
i
not
laughing
denied
the
editor
i
merely
say
that
no
light
was
burning
in
the
tower
window
and
i
very
much
doubt
that
the
clock
struck
more
than
twelve
times
tomorrow
i
shall
go
to
the
tower
and
talk
with
the
caretaker
seth
mcguire
i
prove
to
you
that
i
was
right
if
you
do
i
treat
to
a
dish
of
ice
cream
decorated
with
nuts
make
it
five
gallons
of
gasoline
and
i
be
really
interested
she
countered
due
to
an
unusual
set
of
circumstances
penny
had
fallen
heir
to
two
automobiles
one
a
contraption
whose
battered
sides
bore
the
signature
of
nearly
every
young
person
in
riverview
the
other
a
handsome
maroon
sedan
had
been
the
gift
of
her
father
presented
in
gratitude
because
of
her
excellent
reporting
of
a
case
known
to
many
as
the
green
always
hard
pressed
for
funds
she
found
it
all
but
impossible
to
keep
two
automobiles
in
operation
and
her
financial
difficulties
were
a
constant
source
of
amusement
to
everyone
but
herself
soon
an
electric
sign
proclaiming
toni
in
huge
block
letters
loomed
up
penny
swung
into
the
parking
area
tooting
the
horn
for
service
immediately
a
waiter
brought
out
a
menu
coffee
and
two
hamburgers
penny
ordered
with
a
flourish
everything
on
one
and
everything
but
on
the
other
no
onions
for
the
little
lady
the
waiter
grinned
okay
i
have
right
out
while
waiting
penny
noticed
that
another
car
a
gray
sedan
had
drawn
up
close
to
the
building
although
the
two
men
who
occupied
the
front
seat
had
ordered
food
they
were
not
eating
it
instead
they
conversed
in
low
tones
as
they
appeared
to
watch
someone
inside
the
cafe
dad
notice
those
two
men
she
whispered
touching
his
arm
what
about
them
he
asked
but
before
she
could
reply
the
waiter
came
with
a
tray
of
sandwiches
which
he
hooked
over
the
car
door
not
bad
parker
praised
as
he
bit
into
a
hamburger
first
decent
cup
of
coffee
i
had
in
a
week
too
dad
watch
penny
reminded
him
the
restaurant
door
had
opened
and
a
man
of
early
middle
age
came
outside
immediately
the
couple
in
the
gray
sedan
stiffened
to
alert
attention
as
the
man
passed
their
car
they
lowered
their
heads
but
the
instant
he
had
gone
on
they
turned
to
peer
after
him
the
man
who
was
being
observed
so
closely
seemed
unaware
of
the
scrutiny
crossing
the
parking
lot
he
chose
a
trail
which
led
into
a
dense
grove
of
trees
now
our
chance
cried
one
of
the
men
in
the
gray
sedan
come
on
we
get
him
both
alighted
and
likewise
disappeared
into
the
woods
dad
did
you
hear
what
they
said
asked
penny
i
did
he
answered
grimly
tough
looking
customers
too
i
afraid
they
mean
to
rob
that
first
man
is
there
anything
we
can
do
parker
barely
hesitated
i
may
make
a
chump
of
myself
he
said
but
here
goes
i
tag
along
and
try
to
be
on
hand
if
anything
happens
dad
do
do
it
penny
pleaded
suddenly
frightened
lest
her
father
face
danger
you
might
get
hurt
parker
paid
no
heed
swinging
open
the
car
door
he
strode
across
the
parking
lot
and
entered
the
dark
woods
chapter
not
to
be
left
behind
penny
quickly
followed
her
father
overtaking
him
before
he
had
gone
very
far
into
the
forest
penny
you
should
have
come
he
said
sternly
there
may
be
trouble
and
i
not
have
you
taking
unnecessary
risks
i
do
want
you
to
do
it
either
she
insisted
which
way
did
the
men
go
that
what
i
wonder
parker
responded
listening
intently
hear
anything
not
a
sound
queer
that
all
three
of
them
could
disappear
so
quickly
the
editor
muttered
i
sure
there
been
no
attack
listen
what
was
that
it
sounded
like
a
car
being
started
penny
exclaimed
hastening
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
she
gazed
toward
the
parking
lot
the
parker
car
stood
where
it
had
been
abandoned
but
the
gray
sedan
was
missing
a
moving
tail
light
could
be
seen
far
down
the
road
there
go
our
friends
parker
commented
rather
irritably
their
sudden
departure
probably
saved
me
from
making
a
chump
of
myself
how
could
we
tell
they
did
mean
to
rob
that
other
man
penny
asked
in
an
injured
tone
you
thought
yourself
that
they
intended
to
harm
him
oh
i
not
blaming
you
the
editor
answered
starting
toward
the
parking
lot
i
annoyed
at
myself
this
is
a
graphic
example
of
what
we
were
talking
about
awhile
ago
imagination
decidedly
crestfallen
penny
followed
her
father
to
the
car
they
finished
their
hamburgers
which
had
grown
cold
and
after
the
tray
was
removed
started
home
i
could
do
with
a
little
sleep
parker
yawned
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
your
brand
of
night
life
is
a
bit
too
strenuous
for
me
selecting
a
route
to
riverview
penny
paid
strict
attention
to
the
road
for
the
narrow
pavement
had
been
patched
in
many
places
on
either
side
of
the
highway
stretched
truck
farms
with
row
upon
row
of
neatly
staked
tomatoes
and
other
crops
rounding
a
bend
penny
was
startled
to
see
tongues
of
flame
brightening
the
horizon
a
large
wooden
barn
situated
in
plain
view
on
a
slight
knoll
had
caught
fire
and
was
burning
rapidly
as
she
slammed
on
the
brake
parker
aroused
from
light
slumber
now
what
he
mumbled
drowsily
dad
unless
i
imagining
things
again
that
barn
is
on
fire
let
burn
he
mumbled
and
then
fully
aroused
swung
open
the
car
door
there
were
no
fire
fighters
on
the
scene
in
fact
the
only
person
visible
was
a
woman
in
dark
flannel
night
robe
who
stood
silhouetted
in
the
red
glare
as
penny
and
parker
reached
her
side
she
stared
at
them
almost
stupidly
we
lose
everything
she
said
tonelessly
our
entire
crop
of
melons
is
inside
the
barn
packed
for
shipment
and
my
husband
new
truck
have
you
called
a
fire
company
the
editor
asked
i
called
but
it
wo
do
any
good
she
answered
the
barn
will
be
gone
before
they
can
get
here
with
a
high
wind
whipping
the
flames
penny
and
her
father
knew
that
the
woman
spoke
the
truth
already
the
fire
had
such
a
start
that
even
had
water
been
available
the
barn
could
not
have
been
saved
maybe
i
can
get
out
the
truck
for
you
parker
offered
as
he
swung
open
the
barn
doors
a
wave
of
heat
rushed
into
his
face
coughing
and
choking
he
forced
his
way
into
the
smoke
filled
interior
unaware
that
penny
was
at
his
side
seeing
her
a
moment
later
he
tried
to
send
her
back
you
ca
get
the
truck
out
without
me
to
help
push
she
replied
refusing
to
retreat
come
on
we
can
do
it
the
shiny
red
truck
was
a
fairly
light
one
and
stood
on
an
inclined
cement
floor
which
sloped
toward
the
exit
nevertheless
although
penny
and
her
father
exerted
every
iota
of
their
combined
strength
they
could
not
start
it
moving
maybe
the
brake
is
on
parker
gasped
running
around
to
the
cab
yes
it
is
pushing
once
more
they
were
able
to
start
the
truck
rolling
once
in
motion
its
own
momentum
carried
it
down
the
runway
into
the
open
a
safe
distance
from
the
flames
how
about
the
crated
melons
penny
asked
breathing
hard
from
the
strenuous
exertion
not
a
chance
to
save
them
parker
answered
we
were
lucky
to
get
out
the
truck
driven
back
by
the
heat
penny
and
her
father
went
to
stand
beside
the
woman
in
dark
flannel
thanking
them
for
their
efforts
in
her
behalf
she
added
that
her
name
was
preston
and
that
her
husband
was
absent
john
went
to
riverview
and
has
come
back
yet
she
said
brokenly
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
shock
to
him
all
our
work
gone
up
in
smoke
did
you
have
the
barn
insured
the
editor
questioned
her
john
has
a
small
policy
preston
replied
it
covers
the
barn
but
not
the
melons
stored
inside
those
men
did
it
on
purpose
too
i
saw
one
of
riding
away
what
that
parker
demanded
wondering
if
he
had
understood
the
woman
correctly
you
do
mean
the
fire
deliberately
was
set
yes
it
was
the
woman
affirmed
angrily
i
was
sound
asleep
and
then
i
heard
a
horse
galloping
into
the
yard
i
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
the
rider
throw
a
lighted
torch
into
the
old
hay
loft
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
blaze
up
he
rode
off
was
the
man
anyone
you
knew
parker
asked
amazed
by
the
disclosure
were
you
able
to
see
his
face
hardly
preston
returned
with
a
short
laugh
he
wore
a
black
hood
it
covered
his
head
and
shoulders
a
black
hood
penny
exclaimed
why
dad
that
sounds
like
night
riders
preston
do
you
know
of
any
reason
why
you
and
your
husband
might
be
made
the
target
of
such
cowardly
action
the
newspaper
man
inquired
it
must
have
been
done
because
john
would
join
up
with
them
join
some
organization
you
mean
yes
they
kept
warning
him
something
like
this
would
happen
but
john
would
have
anything
to
do
with
i
do
blame
your
husband
said
the
editor
seeking
to
gather
more
information
tell
me
what
is
the
name
of
this
disreputable
organization
what
is
its
purpose
and
the
names
of
the
men
who
run
it
i
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
what
i
told
you
preston
replied
suddenly
becoming
john
never
said
much
about
it
to
me
are
you
afraid
to
tell
what
you
know
parker
asked
abruptly
it
does
pay
to
do
too
much
talking
you
act
real
friendly
and
you
did
me
a
good
turn
saving
my
truck
but
i
do
even
know
your
name
anthony
parker
owner
of
the
the
information
was
anything
but
reassuring
to
the
woman
you
not
aiming
to
write
up
anything
i
told
you
for
the
paper
she
asked
anxiously
not
unless
i
believe
that
by
doing
so
i
can
expose
these
night
riders
who
have
destroyed
your
barn
please
do
print
anything
in
the
paper
preston
pleaded
it
will
only
do
harm
those
men
will
turn
on
john
harder
than
ever
before
parker
could
reply
the
roof
of
the
storage
barn
collapsed
sending
up
a
shower
of
sparks
and
burning
brands
by
this
time
the
red
glare
in
the
sky
had
attracted
the
attention
of
neighbors
and
several
men
came
running
into
the
yard
realizing
that
he
could
not
hope
to
gain
additional
information
from
the
woman
parker
began
to
examine
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barn
looking
for
hoof
tracks
penny
asked
falling
into
step
beside
him
i
thought
we
might
find
some
providing
the
woman
told
a
straight
story
dad
did
you
ever
hear
of
an
organization
such
as
preston
mentioned
penny
inquired
her
gaze
on
the
ground
i
mean
around
riverview
of
course
parker
shook
his
head
i
never
did
penny
but
if
what
she
says
is
true
the
will
launch
an
investigation
we
have
no
night
riders
in
this
community
not
if
it
in
my
power
to
blast
them
out
here
your
first
clue
dad
excitedly
penny
pointed
to
a
series
of
hoof
marks
plainly
visible
in
the
soft
earth
the
tracks
led
toward
the
main
road
apparently
preston
told
the
truth
about
the
barn
being
fired
by
a
man
on
horseback
parker
declared
as
he
followed
the
trail
leading
out
of
the
yard
these
prints
have
been
made
very
long
dad
you
look
like
sherlock
holmes
scooting
along
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
penny
giggled
you
should
have
a
magnifying
glass
to
make
the
picture
perfect
never
mind
the
comedy
her
father
retorted
gruffly
this
may
mean
a
big
story
for
the
not
to
mention
a
worthwhile
service
to
the
community
oh
i
heartily
in
favor
of
your
welfare
work
penny
chuckled
in
fact
i
think
it
would
be
wonderfully
exciting
to
capture
a
night
rider
is
that
what
you
have
in
mind
we
may
as
well
follow
this
trail
as
far
as
we
can
apparently
the
fellow
rode
his
horse
just
off
the
main
highway
heading
toward
riverview
be
sure
you
do
follow
the
trail
backwards
penny
teased
that
would
absolutely
ruin
your
reputation
as
a
detective
jump
in
the
car
and
drive
while
i
stand
on
the
running
board
parker
ordered
ignoring
his
daughter
attempt
at
wit
keep
close
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
go
slowly
obeying
instructions
penny
drove
the
car
at
an
even
speed
due
to
a
recent
rain
which
had
made
the
ground
very
soft
it
was
possible
to
follow
the
trail
of
hoof
prints
without
difficulty
we
turn
left
here
parker
called
as
they
came
to
a
dirt
road
speed
up
a
bit
or
the
tires
may
stick
and
watch
sharp
for
soft
places
aye
aye
captain
penny
laughed
thoroughly
enjoying
the
adventure
soon
the
car
came
to
the
entrance
of
a
narrow
muddy
lane
and
there
parker
called
a
halt
we
come
to
the
end
of
the
trail
he
announced
have
the
tracks
ended
penny
asked
in
disappointment
as
she
applied
brakes
quite
the
contrary
they
turn
into
this
lane
both
parker
and
his
daughter
gazed
thoughtfully
toward
a
small
cabin
which
could
be
seen
far
back
among
the
trees
despite
the
late
hour
a
light
still
glowed
in
one
of
the
windows
the
man
who
set
the
fire
must
live
there
penny
exclaimed
what
our
next
move
dad
as
she
spoke
the
roar
of
a
fast
traveling
automobile
was
heard
far
up
the
road
approaching
from
the
direction
whence
they
had
just
come
pull
over
parker
instructed
and
flash
the
tail
light
we
want
to
risk
being
struck
barely
did
penny
have
time
to
obey
before
the
of
the
oncoming
car
illuminated
the
roadway
but
as
it
approached
the
automobile
suddenly
slackened
speed
finally
skidding
to
a
standstill
beside
the
parker
sedan
that
you
clem
davis
boomed
a
loud
voice
stand
where
you
are
and
do
make
any
false
moves
chapter
black
good
evening
sheriff
parker
said
evenly
as
he
recognized
the
man
who
stepped
from
a
county
automobile
i
afraid
mistaken
me
for
someone
else
this
time
sheriff
daniels
put
away
his
revolver
and
moved
into
the
beam
of
light
sorry
he
apologized
thought
you
might
be
clem
davis
and
i
taking
any
chances
you
parker
of
the
that
right
agreed
the
editor
looking
for
clem
davis
i
here
to
question
him
i
investigating
a
fire
which
was
set
at
the
preston
place
you
a
fast
worker
sheriff
parker
remarked
my
daughter
and
i
just
left
the
preston
farm
and
we
did
see
you
there
what
put
you
on
davis
trail
our
officer
received
an
anonymous
telephone
call
from
a
woman
she
reported
the
fire
and
said
that
i
find
my
man
here
could
it
have
been
preston
who
notified
you
parker
inquired
thoughtfully
it
was
preston
answered
the
sheriff
i
traced
the
call
to
the
riverview
exchange
thought
it
must
be
the
trick
of
a
crank
until
our
office
got
a
report
that
a
fire
actually
had
been
set
at
the
preston
farm
by
the
way
what
are
you
doing
around
here
parker
oh
just
prowling
the
editor
replied
and
explained
briefly
how
he
and
penny
had
chanced
to
be
at
the
scene
of
the
fire
if
you
followed
a
horseman
to
this
lane
there
may
be
something
to
that
anonymous
telephone
call
the
sheriff
declared
i
look
around
and
then
have
a
talk
with
davis
mind
if
we
accompany
you
inquired
parker
come
along
the
sheriff
invited
penny
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
step
with
the
two
men
as
they
strode
down
the
muddy
lane
a
light
glowed
in
the
window
of
the
cabin
and
a
woman
could
be
seen
sitting
at
a
table
the
sheriff
however
circled
the
house
following
the
trail
of
hoof
marks
he
went
directly
to
the
stable
quietly
opening
the
double
doors
once
inside
sheriff
daniels
switched
on
a
flashlight
the
bright
beam
revealed
six
stalls
all
empty
save
one
in
which
stood
a
handsome
black
mare
who
tugged
restlessly
at
her
tether
her
body
was
covered
with
sweat
and
she
shivered
this
horse
has
been
ridden
hard
the
sheriff
observed
reaching
to
throw
a
blanket
over
her
here
something
interesting
commented
parker
stooping
he
picked
up
a
dark
piece
of
cloth
lying
in
plain
view
on
the
cement
floor
it
had
been
sewed
in
the
shape
of
a
headgear
with
eye
holes
cut
in
the
front
side
a
black
hood
penny
shouted
in
awe
sheriff
daniels
took
the
cloth
from
the
editor
examining
it
closely
but
saying
very
little
ever
hear
of
any
night
riders
in
this
community
parker
asked
after
a
moment
his
tone
casual
never
did
the
sheriff
replied
emphatically
and
i
sure
hope
such
a
story
does
get
started
parker
fingered
the
black
mask
all
the
same
sheriff
you
just
laugh
off
a
thing
like
this
even
if
the
november
elections
far
away
i
not
worried
about
my
job
the
other
broke
in
so
far
as
i
know
there
no
underground
organization
in
this
county
all
this
mask
proves
is
that
clem
davis
may
be
the
man
who
set
the
preston
fire
the
officer
turned
to
leave
the
stable
before
he
could
reach
the
exit
the
double
doors
slowly
opened
a
woman
who
carried
a
lighted
lantern
peered
inside
who
there
she
called
in
a
loud
voice
sheriff
daniels
the
officer
answered
you
need
be
afraid
who
said
anything
about
bein
afraid
the
woman
belligerently
retorted
coming
into
the
stable
she
gazed
with
undisguised
suspicion
from
one
person
to
another
she
was
noticeably
thin
slightly
stooped
and
there
was
a
hard
set
to
her
jaw
you
mrs
davis
the
sheriff
inquired
and
as
she
nodded
he
asked
clem
around
here
no
he
ai
she
answered
defiantly
what
you
wanting
him
for
anyhow
oh
just
to
ask
a
few
questions
where
is
your
husband
mrs
davis
he
went
to
town
early
and
ai
been
back
what
you
aimin
to
lay
onto
him
sheriff
if
your
husband
has
been
here
since
early
evening
who
has
ridden
this
horse
the
sheriff
demanded
ignoring
the
question
davis
gaze
roved
to
the
stall
where
the
black
mare
noisily
crunched
an
ear
of
corn
why
sal
been
rid
she
exclaimed
as
if
genuinely
surprised
but
not
by
clem
he
went
to
town
in
the
flivver
and
he
ai
been
back
sorry
but
i
have
to
take
a
look
in
the
house
search
it
from
cellar
to
attic
the
woman
said
angrily
you
wo
find
clem
what
he
wanted
for
anyway
the
preston
barn
was
set
afire
tonight
and
your
husband
is
a
suspect
clem
never
did
it
why
the
prestons
are
good
friends
of
ours
somebody
just
tryin
to
make
a
peck
o
trouble
for
us
that
may
be
the
sheriff
admitted
you
say
clem
has
been
here
tonight
in
that
case
who
rode
the
mare
i
do
know
anything
about
it
the
woman
maintained
sullenly
did
you
hear
a
horse
come
into
the
yard
i
never
heard
a
sound
until
your
car
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
lane
i
suppose
you
never
saw
this
before
either
the
sheriff
held
up
the
black
hood
which
had
been
found
in
the
barn
davis
stared
blankly
at
the
cloth
i
tell
you
i
do
know
about
it
sheriff
you
ai
being
fair
if
you
try
to
hang
that
fire
onto
clem
and
you
wo
find
him
hidin
in
the
house
if
your
husband
is
here
i
wait
until
he
comes
you
may
have
a
long
wait
sheriff
the
woman
retorted
her
lips
parting
in
a
twisted
smile
you
can
come
in
though
and
look
around
not
caring
to
follow
the
sheriff
into
the
house
penny
and
her
father
bade
him
goodbye
a
moment
later
tramping
down
the
lane
to
their
parked
car
they
both
expressed
the
belief
that
clem
davis
would
not
be
arrested
during
the
night
obviously
the
woman
knows
a
lot
more
than
she
willing
to
tell
parker
remarked
sliding
into
the
car
seat
beside
penny
dad
do
you
think
it
was
clem
who
set
fire
to
the
preston
barn
we
have
no
reason
to
suspect
anyone
else
returned
the
editor
all
the
evidence
points
to
his
guilt
penny
backed
the
car
in
the
narrow
road
heading
toward
riverview
that
was
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
she
said
thoughtfully
does
it
seem
to
you
that
the
evidence
was
almost
too
plain
what
do
you
mean
penny
well
i
was
just
thinking
if
i
had
been
in
clem
davis
place
i
never
would
have
left
a
black
hood
lying
where
the
first
person
to
enter
the
barn
would
be
sure
to
see
it
that
so
it
was
a
bit
obvious
parker
admitted
the
horse
was
left
in
the
stable
and
the
hoof
tracks
leading
to
the
davis
place
were
easy
to
follow
all
true
parker
nodded
is
it
possible
that
someone
could
have
tried
to
throw
the
blame
on
clem
suggested
penny
anxiously
awaiting
her
father
reply
there
may
be
something
to
the
theory
parker
responded
still
davis
did
deny
that
the
mare
belonged
to
her
husband
she
claimed
that
she
had
heard
the
horse
come
into
the
stable
which
obviously
was
a
lie
furthermore
i
gathered
the
impression
that
clem
knew
the
sheriff
was
after
him
and
intends
to
hide
out
it
will
be
interesting
to
learn
if
daniels
makes
an
arrest
do
you
expect
to
print
anything
about
it
in
the
paper
only
routine
news
of
the
fire
parker
replied
there
may
be
much
more
to
this
little
incident
than
appears
on
the
surface
but
until
something
develops
we
must
wait
if
you
could
gain
proof
that
night
riders
are
operating
in
this
community
what
then
penny
suggested
eagerly
in
that
case
i
should
certainly
launch
a
vigorous
campaign
but
why
go
into
all
the
details
now
i
sure
i
not
assign
you
to
the
story
why
not
penny
asked
in
an
injured
tone
i
think
night
riders
would
be
especially
suited
to
my
journalistic
talents
i
could
gather
information
about
clem
davis
and
the
prestons
this
is
sheriff
daniel
baby
and
we
let
him
take
care
of
it
for
the
time
being
parker
interrupted
why
not
devote
yourself
to
the
great
mystery
of
the
hubell
clock
that
should
provide
a
safe
outlook
for
your
energies
the
car
was
drawing
close
to
riverview
as
it
approached
the
tall
stone
tower
penny
raised
her
eyes
to
the
dark
windows
just
then
the
big
clock
struck
twice
two
parker
observed
taking
a
quick
glance
at
his
watch
or
would
you
say
three
there
no
argument
about
it
this
time
dad
all
the
same
i
intend
to
prove
to
you
that
i
was
right
how
her
father
asked
covering
a
wide
yawn
i
do
know
penny
admitted
favoring
the
grim
tower
with
a
dark
scowl
but
just
you
wait
i
find
a
way
chapter
new
i
declare
getting
folks
up
becomes
a
harder
task
each
morning
declared
maud
weems
who
had
served
as
the
parker
housekeeper
for
eleven
years
as
she
brought
a
platter
of
bacon
and
eggs
to
the
breakfast
table
i
call
and
call
until
i
fairly
hoarse
and
all
i
get
in
response
is
a
few
sleepy
mutters
and
mumbles
the
food
is
stone
cold
it
good
all
the
same
praised
penny
pouring
herself
a
glass
of
orange
juice
there
not
a
woman
in
riverview
who
can
equal
your
cooking
i
in
no
mood
for
blarney
this
morning
the
housekeeper
warned
i
must
say
quite
frankly
that
i
do
approve
of
the
irregular
hours
in
this
house
penny
and
i
did
get
in
a
little
late
last
night
parker
admitted
winking
at
his
daughter
a
little
late
it
must
have
been
at
least
four
when
you
came
in
oh
i
heard
you
tiptoe
up
the
stairs
even
if
you
did
take
off
your
shoes
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
after
two
penny
corrected
i
sorry
though
that
we
awakened
you
i
had
been
asleep
weems
replied
somewhat
mollified
by
the
apology
i
sure
i
heard
every
stroke
of
the
clock
last
night
you
did
penny
exclaimed
with
sudden
interest
how
many
times
would
you
say
it
struck
at
midnight
i
mean
the
hubell
tower
clock
such
a
question
weems
protested
thoroughly
exasperated
it
a
very
important
one
penny
insisted
my
reputation
and
five
gallons
of
gas
are
at
stake
so
weigh
well
your
words
before
you
speak
the
clock
struck
twelve
of
course
there
you
see
penny
parker
grinned
triumphantly
does
that
satisfy
you
weems
penny
persisted
did
you
actually
count
the
strokes
certainly
not
why
should
i
the
clock
always
strikes
twelve
therefore
it
must
have
struck
that
number
last
night
i
regret
to
say
you
just
disqualified
yourself
as
a
witness
in
this
case
penny
said
helping
herself
to
the
last
strip
of
bacon
on
the
platter
i
must
search
farther
afield
for
proof
what
are
you
talking
about
anyhow
the
housekeeper
protested
it
does
make
sense
to
me
as
she
finished
breakfast
penny
explained
to
weems
how
the
disagreement
with
her
father
had
arisen
the
housekeeper
displayed
slight
interest
in
the
tale
of
the
clock
but
asked
many
questions
about
the
fire
at
the
preston
farm
that
reminds
me
parker
suddenly
exclaimed
before
penny
had
finished
the
story
i
want
to
sheriff
daniels
before
i
start
for
the
office
excuse
me
please
pushing
aside
his
chair
he
went
hurriedly
to
the
living
room
not
wishing
to
miss
any
news
which
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
penny
trailed
him
hovering
close
to
the
telephone
however
her
father
brief
comments
told
her
almost
nothing
what
did
you
learn
she
inquired
eagerly
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
was
clem
davis
arrested
last
night
no
it
turned
out
about
as
we
expected
apparently
davis
knew
the
sheriff
was
looking
for
him
anyway
he
never
returned
home
jamming
on
his
hat
parker
started
for
the
front
door
penny
pursued
him
to
the
garage
carrying
on
a
running
conversation
this
rather
explodes
my
theory
about
clem
not
being
guilty
she
remarked
ruefully
if
he
were
innocent
one
would
expect
him
to
face
the
sheriff
and
prove
an
alibi
davis
ca
be
far
away
parker
responded
getting
into
the
maroon
sedan
the
sheriff
will
nab
him
soon
penny
held
open
the
garage
doors
watching
as
her
father
backed
down
the
driveway
scraping
the
bark
of
a
tree
whose
gnarled
trunk
already
bore
many
scars
before
she
could
reenter
the
house
louise
sidell
a
slightly
plump
girl
who
was
penny
most
loyal
friend
sauntered
into
the
yard
hi
she
greeted
cheerily
about
ready
ready
for
what
penny
asked
her
face
blank
louise
regarded
her
indignantly
if
that
is
just
like
you
penny
parker
you
make
promises
and
then
forget
them
do
you
remember
telling
van
cleve
of
the
woman
club
that
we
would
help
sell
tags
today
for
the
orphans
home
summer
camp
now
that
you
remind
me
i
have
a
vague
recollection
how
many
are
we
to
sell
at
not
less
than
a
quarter
each
i
have
the
tags
but
have
to
work
fast
or
the
other
girls
will
sell
all
the
easy
customers
i
be
with
you
in
two
shakes
penny
promised
heading
for
the
house
wait
until
i
tell
weems
where
i
am
going
returning
a
moment
later
with
the
car
ignition
keys
she
found
louise
staring
disconsolately
at
the
empty
space
in
the
garage
what
became
of
your
new
car
asked
her
chum
dad
auto
is
in
the
garage
for
repairs
penny
explained
briefly
i
did
have
the
heart
to
make
him
walk
i
should
think
not
laughed
louise
imagine
having
three
cars
in
one
family
if
you
can
call
this
mess
of
junk
by
such
a
flattering
name
depreciatingly
she
kicked
the
patched
tire
of
a
battered
but
brightly
painted
flivver
which
had
seen
its
heyday
in
the
early
thirties
do
speak
so
disrespectfully
of
my
property
penny
chided
sliding
into
the
high
uncomfortable
seat
leaping
lena
is
a
good
car
even
if
she
is
a
bit
creaky
in
the
joints
she
still
takes
us
places
and
leaves
us
stranded
louise
added
with
a
sniff
oh
well
go
if
we
can
penny
stepped
on
the
starter
and
waited
expectantly
the
motor
sputtered
and
coughed
but
true
to
form
would
not
start
just
as
the
girls
were
convinced
that
they
must
walk
there
was
an
explosive
backfire
and
then
the
car
began
to
quiver
with
its
familiar
motion
you
should
sell
lena
to
the
government
for
a
cannon
louise
teased
as
they
rattled
down
the
street
what
do
you
burn
in
this
smoke
machine
kerosene
never
mind
the
slurs
where
do
we
start
our
business
operations
we
been
assigned
to
the
corner
of
madison
and
clark
streets
louise
answered
as
she
separated
the
yellow
benefit
tags
into
two
evenly
divided
piles
it
should
take
us
long
to
get
rid
of
these
neither
of
the
girls
regretted
their
promise
to
help
with
the
sale
for
the
cause
was
a
worthy
one
the
campaign
to
raise
sufficient
funds
with
which
to
purchase
and
equip
an
orphans
summer
camp
site
had
been
underway
many
weeks
and
was
headed
by
van
cleve
a
prominent
club
woman
parking
leaping
lena
at
the
designated
street
corner
the
girls
went
to
work
with
a
will
all
their
lives
they
had
lived
in
riverview
and
penny
in
particular
had
a
wide
acquaintance
accosting
nearly
everyone
who
passed
she
soon
disposed
of
all
her
tags
and
then
sold
many
for
her
chum
they
gone
fast
louise
declared
as
the
morning
wore
on
we
have
only
one
left
do
sell
that
tag
penny
said
impulsively
i
have
it
earmarked
for
a
certain
person
old
seth
mcguire
the
caretaker
at
the
hubell
clock
tower
louise
asked
in
astonishment
yes
he
always
liked
children
and
i
think
he
would
be
glad
to
help
but
why
drive
so
far
protested
louise
i
sure
we
could
dispose
of
it
right
here
and
much
quicker
oh
i
have
a
special
reason
for
going
to
see
seth
penny
answered
carelessly
i
tell
you
about
it
on
the
way
there
from
her
chum
manner
louise
deducted
that
something
interesting
lay
ahead
she
had
learned
frequently
to
her
sorrow
that
penny
enjoyed
interviewing
unusual
characters
and
engaging
in
amazing
activities
only
a
few
months
earlier
the
girls
had
operated
their
own
newspaper
in
an
abandoned
downtown
building
with
results
which
were
still
the
talk
of
riverview
another
time
they
had
attended
a
society
wedding
on
an
island
guarded
by
a
drawbridge
and
had
ended
by
using
the
drawbridge
as
a
means
of
capturing
a
boatload
of
crooks
in
fact
louise
took
delight
in
remarking
that
if
ever
her
chum
chose
to
write
an
autobiography
a
suitable
title
would
be
life
with
penelope
parker
never
a
dull
moment
what
up
now
penny
she
inquired
as
they
rattled
toward
the
hubell
tower
in
leaping
lena
just
a
little
argument
i
had
with
dad
last
night
i
maintain
that
the
big
clock
struck
thirteen
last
night
at
midnight
he
thinks
i
a
wee
bit
touched
in
the
head
which
you
must
be
retorted
louise
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
what
so
crazy
about
it
penny
asked
with
a
grimace
did
you
ever
hear
a
clock
strike
the
wrong
number
of
course
but
not
the
hubell
clock
why
the
works
were
purchased
in
europe
and
it
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
even
a
good
clock
can
make
a
mistake
i
guess
anyway
we
see
what
seth
mcguire
has
to
say
about
it
penny
brought
leaping
lena
to
a
quivering
halt
opposite
the
tall
hubell
tower
glancing
upward
at
the
clock
face
she
saw
that
the
hands
indicated
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
rather
an
awkward
time
to
call
she
remarked
swinging
open
the
car
door
but
seth
probably
wo
mind
as
the
girls
walked
toward
the
tower
entrance
they
noticed
that
the
grounds
surrounding
the
building
were
not
as
neat
as
when
last
they
had
viewed
them
the
shrubs
were
untrimmed
the
lawn
choked
with
weeds
and
old
newspapers
had
matted
against
the
hedge
i
wonder
if
mcguire
has
been
well
penny
commented
knocking
on
the
tower
door
he
always
took
pride
in
looking
after
the
yard
at
least
he
seems
to
be
up
and
around
louise
returned
in
a
low
tone
i
can
hear
someone
moving
about
inside
the
girls
waited
expectantly
for
the
door
to
open
when
there
was
no
response
to
their
knock
penny
tried
again
who
there
called
a
loud
and
not
very
friendly
voice
penny
knew
that
it
was
not
old
seth
who
spoke
for
the
tones
were
unmistakable
we
came
to
see
mcguire
she
called
through
the
panel
the
door
swung
back
and
the
girls
found
themselves
facing
a
stout
man
of
perhaps
forty
who
wore
a
soiled
suede
jacket
and
unpressed
corduroy
trousers
mcguire
not
here
any
more
he
informed
curtly
you
probably
find
him
at
his
farm
before
the
man
could
close
the
door
penny
quickly
asked
if
mcguire
had
given
up
his
position
as
caretaker
because
of
sickness
oh
he
was
getting
too
old
to
do
his
work
the
man
answered
with
a
shrug
i
charley
phelps
the
new
attendant
visiting
hours
are
from
two
to
four
each
afternoon
we
did
come
to
see
the
clock
persisted
penny
what
did
bring
you
here
then
the
man
demanded
gruffly
you
a
personal
friend
of
seth
not
exactly
penny
peered
beyond
the
caretaker
into
an
untidy
living
room
clouded
with
tobacco
smoke
we
thought
we
might
sell
him
one
of
these
tags
perhaps
you
would
like
to
contribute
to
the
orphans
camp
fund
she
extended
the
bit
of
yellow
cardboard
bestowing
upon
the
attendant
one
of
her
most
dazzling
smiles
no
thanks
sister
he
declined
refusing
to
take
the
tag
you
have
to
peddle
your
wares
somewhere
else
only
cents
i
not
interested
now
run
along
and
give
me
a
chance
to
eat
my
lunch
in
peace
sorry
to
have
bothered
you
penny
apologized
woodenly
without
moving
from
the
door
she
inquired
oh
by
the
way
what
happened
to
the
clock
last
night
nothing
happened
to
it
the
caretaker
retorted
what
mean
at
midnight
it
struck
thirteen
times
instead
of
twelve
you
must
have
dreamed
it
the
man
declared
say
what
are
you
trying
to
do
anyhow
start
stories
so
i
lose
my
job
why
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
penny
gasped
i
truly
believed
that
the
clock
did
strike
thirteen
well
you
were
wrong
and
i
thank
you
not
to
go
around
telling
folks
such
bunk
the
man
said
angrily
the
clock
has
struck
a
wrong
hour
since
the
day
it
was
installed
i
take
better
care
of
the
mechanism
than
seth
mcguire
ever
did
i
did
mean
to
intimate
that
you
were
careless
penny
began
she
did
not
complete
the
sentence
for
charley
phelps
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
chapter
well
penny
you
certainly
drew
lightning
that
time
louise
remarked
dryly
as
the
girls
retreated
to
leaping
lena
i
thought
phelps
was
going
to
throw
the
tower
at
you
how
could
i
know
he
was
so
touchy
penny
asked
in
a
grieved
tone
you
did
talk
as
if
you
thought
he
had
been
careless
in
taking
care
of
the
big
clock
i
never
meant
it
that
way
lou
anyway
he
could
have
been
more
polite
jerking
open
the
car
door
penny
slid
behind
the
steering
wheel
and
jammed
her
foot
on
the
starter
leaping
lena
apparently
realizing
that
her
young
mistress
was
in
no
mood
for
trifling
responded
with
instantaneous
action
i
guess
you
satisfied
now
that
the
clock
never
struck
thirteen
louise
teased
as
the
car
fairly
leaped
forward
i
should
say
not
penny
retorted
why
i
more
convinced
than
ever
that
something
went
wrong
with
the
mechanism
last
night
phelps
knew
it
too
and
for
that
reason
did
want
us
asking
questions
you
die
hard
penny
chuckled
louise
from
now
on
i
suppose
you
go
around
asking
everyone
you
meet
were
you
at
midnight
of
the
thirteenth
it
would
do
any
good
most
folks
just
take
things
for
granted
in
this
world
but
there
one
person
who
would
pay
attention
to
that
clock
who
why
old
seth
mcguire
we
drive
out
to
his
farm
and
ask
him
about
it
it
lunch
time
and
i
hungry
louise
protested
oh
you
can
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
eating
penny
overruled
her
business
before
pleasure
you
know
seth
mcguire
one
of
riverview
best
known
and
well
loved
characters
had
been
caretaker
at
the
hubell
clock
tower
from
the
day
of
its
erection
and
the
girls
could
not
but
wonder
why
he
had
been
relieved
of
his
post
the
old
man
had
personally
installed
the
complicated
machinery
caring
for
it
faithfully
over
the
years
in
fact
his
only
other
interest
in
life
was
his
farm
located
a
mile
from
the
city
limits
and
it
was
there
that
penny
hoped
to
find
him
watch
for
a
sign
hollow
she
instructed
mcguire
has
given
his
place
a
fancy
name
a
moment
later
louise
seeing
the
marker
cried
there
it
is
slow
down
penny
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
leaping
lena
responded
by
shivering
in
every
one
of
her
ancient
joints
louise
was
thrown
forward
barely
catching
herself
in
time
to
prevent
a
collision
with
the
windshield
why
do
you
join
a
stunt
circus
she
said
irritably
you
drive
like
demon
dan
we
here
replied
penny
cheerfully
nice
looking
place
is
it
the
car
had
pulled
up
near
a
small
cottage
framed
in
greenery
an
even
rich
green
lawn
was
highlighted
here
and
there
by
beds
of
bright
red
and
blue
flowers
after
admiring
the
grounds
the
girls
rang
the
front
bell
receiving
no
response
they
went
around
to
the
rear
pounding
on
the
kitchen
screen
door
mcguire
not
here
said
louise
just
another
wild
goose
chase
let
try
this
penny
suggested
indicating
a
long
low
structure
made
of
cement
building
blocks
which
was
roofed
with
tin
a
sign
dangling
above
the
door
proclaimed
that
it
was
the
foundry
and
machine
shop
of
one
seth
mcguire
maker
of
bells
and
clocks
as
the
girls
peered
through
the
open
door
an
arresting
sight
met
their
gaze
through
clouds
of
smoke
they
saw
a
spry
old
man
directing
the
movements
of
a
muscular
youth
who
pulled
a
large
crucible
of
molten
metal
on
an
overhead
pulley
track
are
you
seth
mcguire
penny
shouted
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
noise
of
running
machinery
the
old
man
turning
his
head
waved
them
back
do
come
in
here
now
he
warned
it
dangerous
wait
until
we
pour
the
bell
with
deft
sure
hands
the
old
fellow
pulled
control
chains
attached
to
the
crucible
the
container
twisted
and
finally
overturned
allowing
the
molten
metal
to
pour
into
a
mold
as
the
last
drops
ran
out
of
it
a
great
cloud
of
steam
arose
enveloping
both
the
old
man
and
his
helper
wo
they
be
burned
louise
murmured
in
alarm
moving
hastily
backwards
mcguire
seems
to
know
what
he
doing
penny
answered
watching
with
interest
in
a
moment
the
steam
cleared
away
and
the
old
man
motioned
that
the
girls
might
come
inside
you
have
to
excuse
my
manners
he
apologized
his
mild
blue
eyes
regarding
them
with
a
twinkle
pouring
a
bell
is
exacting
work
and
you
ca
stop
until
it
done
is
that
what
you
were
doing
penny
inquired
staring
at
the
steaming
mass
which
had
been
poured
into
the
mold
it
sort
of
like
making
a
gelatin
pudding
is
it
jake
and
me
never
thought
of
it
that
way
the
old
man
replied
i
learned
from
an
old
swiss
bell
maker
when
i
was
a
lad
and
i
apprenticed
under
a
master
you
may
be
sure
of
that
how
do
you
make
a
bell
anyway
louise
inquired
curiously
you
ca
tell
in
five
minutes
what
it
takes
a
lifetime
to
learn
the
old
man
answered
now
a
bell
like
this
one
i
making
for
the
methodist
church
at
blairstown
takes
a
heap
o
work
jake
and
me
have
worked
a
solid
week
getting
the
pattern
and
mold
ready
for
that
pouring
job
you
just
saw
do
you
ever
have
any
failures
penny
asked
seeking
to
draw
him
out
not
many
but
once
in
awhile
a
bell
cracks
the
old
fellow
said
modestly
that
happens
when
the
mold
is
damp
or
not
of
proper
temperature
if
gasses
collect
you
may
get
a
nice
healthy
explosion
too
does
it
take
a
long
while
to
finish
a
bell
after
it
been
poured
penny
pursued
the
subject
a
large
one
may
require
a
week
to
cool
but
i
have
this
fellow
out
of
the
mold
by
tomorrow
night
mcguire
returned
then
we
polish
her
off
put
in
the
clapper
and
attach
the
bell
to
a
sturdy
mounting
if
the
tone
is
right
she
be
ready
to
install
how
do
you
tell
about
the
tone
louise
questioned
in
perplexity
this
one
should
have
a
deep
low
tone
the
old
man
replied
other
things
being
equal
a
large
bell
gives
a
deeper
tone
than
a
small
one
pitch
depends
upon
diameter
and
timbre
upon
the
shape
and
the
alloy
used
i
never
realized
there
was
much
to
a
bell
besides
its
commented
penny
but
tell
me
mcguire
do
you
find
this
work
more
interesting
than
taking
care
of
the
clock
tower
looking
after
that
place
was
work
it
was
more
like
a
rest
cure
i
took
the
job
because
twelve
years
ago
when
the
tower
went
up
they
could
find
a
competent
man
to
look
after
the
clock
and
now
you
gone
back
to
your
old
trade
oh
i
liked
it
at
the
tower
old
seth
admitted
truthfully
i
a
bit
old
to
do
heavy
work
such
as
this
more
than
likely
i
have
gone
on
putting
in
my
time
if
blake
had
wanted
the
job
for
a
friend
of
his
mr
blake
penny
inquired
thoughtfully
do
you
mean
clyde
blake
the
real
estate
man
the
old
bell
maker
nodded
as
he
gazed
moodily
out
the
window
toward
the
distant
tower
which
could
be
seen
outlined
against
the
blue
sky
yes
it
was
blake
that
eased
me
out
of
that
job
he
has
a
lot
of
influence
and
he
uses
it
in
ways
some
might
say
is
always
proper
i
can
make
a
fair
living
as
long
as
i
have
my
health
so
i
not
complaining
we
met
the
new
caretaker
this
morning
penny
said
after
a
moment
he
was
very
polite
to
us
and
the
grounds
have
gone
to
wrack
and
ruin
did
you
notice
the
flower
beds
old
seth
asked
feeling
creeping
into
his
voice
half
choked
with
weeds
charley
phelps
has
turned
a
hand
since
he
took
over
there
six
weeks
ago
i
suppose
he
spends
most
of
his
time
looking
after
the
big
clock
penny
remarked
deliberately
leading
the
old
man
deeper
charley
phelps
spends
most
of
his
hours
smoking
that
vile
pipe
of
his
and
entertaining
his
roustabout
friends
old
seth
snapped
he
know
as
much
as
a
child
about
complicated
clock
machinery
what
he
take
care
of
with
an
oil
can
goes
unrepaired
the
conversation
had
moved
in
exactly
the
channel
which
penny
desired
no
doubt
that
explains
why
the
clock
has
always
been
striking
right
of
late
she
said
in
an
offhand
way
last
night
i
was
almost
sure
i
heard
it
strike
thirteen
instead
of
twelve
times
in
fact
i
had
a
little
argument
with
my
father
about
it
you
were
correct
the
old
man
assured
her
i
was
working
late
here
in
the
shop
and
heard
it
myself
there
you
see
louise
penny
cried
triumphantly
turning
to
her
chum
mcguire
what
would
cause
the
clock
to
strike
wrong
the
other
asked
i
was
wondering
myself
he
admitted
in
all
the
ten
years
i
was
at
the
tower
it
never
once
struck
an
incorrect
hour
i
think
that
there
must
have
been
something
wrong
with
the
striking
train
pardon
my
ignorance
laughed
penny
but
what
in
the
world
is
the
striking
train
oh
we
apply
that
name
to
the
center
section
of
the
mechanism
which
operates
the
clock
the
going
train
drives
the
hands
while
the
quarter
train
chimes
the
sounding
four
tuned
bells
just
as
clear
as
mud
sighed
louise
who
disliked
all
mechanical
things
does
the
clock
strike
wrong
every
night
last
night
was
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
it
add
a
stroke
mcguire
answered
i
be
listening
though
to
see
if
phelps
gets
it
fixed
penny
and
louise
had
accomplished
the
purpose
of
their
trip
and
so
after
looking
about
the
shop
for
a
few
minutes
left
without
trying
to
sell
the
old
man
a
tag
why
did
you
ask
him
to
take
one
louise
asked
as
she
and
her
chum
climbed
into
the
parked
car
oh
i
do
know
penny
answered
uncomfortably
it
just
came
over
me
that
old
seth
probably
does
have
much
money
now
that
he
out
of
steady
work
he
must
make
quite
a
lot
from
his
bells
but
how
often
does
he
get
an
order
penny
speculated
i
guess
not
once
in
three
months
if
that
often
it
a
pity
blake
had
to
push
mcguire
out
of
the
tower
job
louise
nodded
agreement
and
then
with
a
quick
change
of
subject
reminded
her
chum
that
they
had
had
no
lunch
it
too
late
to
go
home
said
penny
who
had
other
plans
i
treat
you
to
one
of
the
biggest
hamburger
sandwiches
you
ever
wrapped
your
teeth
around
how
that
i
take
anything
so
long
as
you
pay
for
it
louise
agreed
with
a
laugh
driving
on
to
toni
the
girls
lunched
there
without
incident
and
then
started
for
riverview
by
a
different
route
say
where
are
you
taking
me
anyway
louise
demanded
suspiciously
i
never
been
on
this
road
before
only
out
to
the
davis
farm
penny
responded
with
a
grin
we
have
a
little
detective
work
to
do
during
the
bumpy
ride
she
gave
her
chum
a
vivid
account
of
the
adventure
she
had
shared
with
her
father
the
previous
night
and
just
what
do
you
expect
to
learn
louise
inquired
at
the
conclusion
of
the
tale
are
we
expected
to
capture
clem
davis
with
our
bare
hands
and
turn
him
over
to
the
authorities
nothing
quite
so
startling
i
thought
possibly
davis
might
talk
with
us
she
seemed
to
know
a
lot
more
about
the
fire
than
she
would
tell
i
do
mind
tagging
along
louise
consented
reluctantly
it
seem
likely
though
that
the
woman
will
break
down
and
implicate
her
husband
just
because
you
want
a
story
for
the
undisturbed
by
her
chum
teasing
penny
parked
leaping
lena
at
the
entrance
to
the
lane
and
the
girls
walked
to
the
cabin
it
does
look
as
if
anyone
is
here
louise
remarked
rapping
for
the
second
time
on
the
oaken
door
i
sure
there
is
penny
replied
in
a
whisper
as
we
came
up
the
lane
i
saw
the
curtains
move
louise
knocked
a
third
time
so
hard
that
the
door
rattled
at
any
rate
no
one
is
going
to
answer
she
said
we
may
as
well
go
all
right
penny
agreed
although
it
was
not
her
nature
to
give
up
so
easily
the
girls
walked
down
the
lane
until
a
clump
of
bushes
screened
them
from
the
cabin
let
wait
here
penny
proposed
halting
i
have
a
hunch
davis
is
hiding
from
us
what
to
be
gained
by
waiting
grumbled
louise
nevertheless
she
crouched
beside
her
chum
watching
the
house
ten
minutes
elapsed
both
louise
and
penny
grew
very
weary
then
unexpectedly
the
cabin
door
opened
and
davis
peered
into
the
yard
seeing
no
one
she
took
a
wooden
water
bucket
and
started
with
it
to
the
pump
which
was
situated
midway
between
cabin
and
stable
now
our
chance
penny
whispered
eagerly
come
on
louise
we
cut
off
her
retreat
and
she
ca
avoid
meeting
us
chapter
hastening
up
the
lane
penny
and
louise
approached
the
pump
in
such
a
way
that
davis
could
not
return
to
the
house
without
meeting
them
not
until
the
woman
had
filled
the
water
bucket
and
was
starting
back
did
she
see
the
two
girls
well
she
demanded
defiantly
by
daylight
the
woman
appeared
much
younger
than
penny
had
taken
her
to
be
the
previous
night
not
more
than
she
wore
a
shapeless
faded
blue
dress
which
had
seen
many
washings
rather
attractive
brown
hair
had
been
drawn
back
into
a
tight
unbecoming
knot
that
made
her
face
seem
grotesquely
long
i
do
suppose
you
recognize
me
penny
began
diffidently
my
father
and
i
were
here
last
night
with
sheriff
daniels
i
remember
you
very
well
the
woman
retorted
what
do
you
want
why
i
should
like
to
buy
some
melons
penny
replied
the
idea
only
that
instant
occurring
to
her
have
you
any
for
sale
melons
the
woman
repeated
and
the
hard
line
of
her
mouth
relaxed
i
thought
you
came
to
pester
me
with
questions
sure
we
got
some
good
heart
o
gold
out
in
the
patch
how
many
do
you
want
about
three
i
guess
you
can
pick
out
yourself
if
you
want
to
davis
offered
setting
down
the
water
bucket
she
led
the
way
through
a
gate
to
a
melon
patch
behind
the
cabin
her
suspicions
not
entirely
allayed
she
demanded
sheriff
daniels
did
send
you
out
here
indeed
not
penny
assured
her
i
have
seen
him
since
last
night
it
all
right
then
davis
said
in
a
more
friendly
tone
she
stooped
to
examine
a
ripe
melon
i
figured
maybe
he
sent
you
to
find
out
what
became
of
my
husband
oh
no
did
davis
return
home
last
night
not
on
your
life
the
woman
answered
grimly
and
he
wo
be
back
either
not
while
sheriff
daniels
is
looking
for
him
from
davis
manner
of
speaking
penny
was
convinced
that
she
had
been
in
communication
with
her
husband
since
the
sheriff
visit
trying
to
keep
her
voice
casual
she
observed
do
you
think
it
would
be
wise
for
your
husband
to
give
himself
up
by
hiding
he
makes
it
appear
as
though
he
actually
did
set
fire
to
the
preston
barn
clem
would
be
a
fool
to
give
himself
up
now
why
they
be
sure
to
hang
the
fire
onto
him
even
though
he
was
within
a
mile
of
the
preston
place
then
could
he
prove
it
not
a
chance
the
woman
said
with
a
short
hard
laugh
clem
was
framed
he
never
rode
the
horse
last
night
and
that
black
hood
was
planted
in
the
stable
does
your
husband
have
any
enemies
sure
he
got
plenty
of
then
perhaps
you
can
name
a
person
who
might
have
tried
to
throw
blame
on
your
husband
i
could
tell
plenty
if
i
was
a
mind
to
the
woman
said
significantly
i
do
it
in
a
minute
only
it
would
make
things
worse
for
clem
penny
started
to
reply
then
remained
silent
as
she
saw
that
gaze
had
focused
upon
a
section
of
cornfield
which
fringed
the
melon
patch
the
tall
stalks
were
waving
in
an
agitated
manner
suggesting
that
someone
might
be
moving
among
them
here
are
your
melons
davis
said
nervously
thrusting
three
large
ones
into
penny
hands
that
will
be
a
quarter
as
the
girl
paid
her
she
abruptly
turned
and
hurried
toward
the
house
just
a
minute
davis
penny
called
if
you
only
talk
to
me
i
may
be
able
to
help
your
husband
the
woman
heard
but
paid
no
heed
picking
up
the
water
bucket
she
entered
the
cabin
closing
the
door
behind
her
well
we
gained
three
melons
and
that
all
louise
shrugged
our
next
move
i
think
davis
was
on
the
verge
of
telling
us
something
important
penny
declared
her
voice
low
then
she
saw
someone
out
there
in
the
corn
field
and
changed
her
mind
i
do
see
anyone
now
louise
said
staring
in
the
direction
her
chum
had
indicated
the
stalks
are
even
moving
they
were
a
moment
ago
clem
davis
may
be
hiding
out
there
lou
or
it
could
be
some
of
sheriff
davis
men
watching
the
cabin
or
an
indian
waiting
to
scalp
us
teased
louise
let
go
back
to
the
car
penny
shook
her
head
and
started
toward
the
corn
patch
reluctantly
louise
followed
overtaking
her
at
the
edge
of
the
field
sheriff
daniels
penny
called
through
cupped
hands
there
was
no
answer
only
a
gentle
rippling
of
the
corn
stalks
some
distance
from
them
whoever
the
person
is
he
sneaking
away
penny
whispered
come
on
let
stop
him
do
be
foolish
louise
protested
but
her
chum
had
vanished
into
the
forest
of
tall
corn
after
a
moment
of
indecision
she
too
entered
the
field
by
that
time
there
was
no
sign
of
penny
no
sound
to
guide
her
wandering
aimlessly
first
in
one
direction
then
another
she
soon
became
hopelessly
lost
penny
she
shouted
frantically
here
called
a
voice
not
far
away
tracing
the
sound
and
making
repeated
calls
louise
finally
came
face
to
face
with
her
chum
such
a
commotion
as
you
been
making
chided
penny
not
a
chance
to
catch
that
fellow
now
i
do
care
louise
retorted
crossly
her
hair
was
disarranged
stockings
matted
with
burs
if
we
can
get
out
of
this
dreadful
maze
i
want
to
go
to
the
car
we
at
the
edge
of
the
field
follow
me
and
i
pilot
you
to
safety
emerging
a
minute
later
at
the
end
of
the
corn
row
penny
saw
the
stable
only
a
few
yards
away
impulsively
she
proposed
to
louise
that
they
investigate
it
for
possible
clues
i
had
enough
detective
work
for
one
day
her
chum
complained
anyway
what
do
you
hope
to
discover
in
an
old
barn
maybe
i
can
induce
the
horse
to
talk
penny
chuckled
sal
must
know
all
the
answers
if
only
she
could
speak
you
have
to
give
her
the
third
degree
by
yourself
louise
decided
with
finality
i
shall
go
to
the
car
taking
the
melons
with
her
she
marched
stiffly
down
the
lane
and
climbed
into
leaping
lena
carefully
she
rearranged
her
hair
plucked
burs
and
then
grew
impatient
because
her
chum
did
not
come
fully
twenty
minutes
elapsed
before
penny
emerged
from
the
stable
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
so
long
lou
she
apologized
as
she
reached
the
car
see
what
i
found
penny
held
up
a
bright
silver
object
which
resembled
a
locket
save
that
it
was
smaller
what
is
it
louise
inquired
with
interest
a
man
watch
charm
it
has
a
picture
inside
too
with
her
fingernail
penny
pried
open
the
lid
flat
against
the
cover
had
been
fastened
the
photograph
of
a
boy
who
might
have
been
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
where
did
you
get
it
penny
i
found
it
lying
on
the
barn
floor
not
far
from
the
place
where
we
picked
up
the
black
hood
last
night
then
it
must
belong
to
clem
davis
it
may
penny
admitted
sliding
into
the
seat
beside
her
chum
still
i
do
believe
the
davis
have
any
children
what
will
you
do
with
the
charm
turn
it
over
to
the
sheriff
i
suppose
i
should
after
i
shown
it
to
dad
penny
replied
carefully
tying
the
trinket
into
the
corner
of
a
handkerchief
you
know
lou
since
finding
this
i
wonder
if
davis
may
not
have
told
the
truth
about
what
penny
she
said
that
her
husband
had
been
framed
then
you
think
this
watch
charm
was
left
in
the
barn
to
throw
suspicion
upon
clem
davis
penny
shook
her
head
no
this
is
my
theory
louise
perhaps
someone
hid
the
black
hood
there
and
rode
clem
horse
to
make
it
appear
he
was
the
guilty
person
inadvertently
that
same
person
lost
this
watch
charm
in
that
case
you
would
have
a
clue
which
might
solve
the
case
exactly
penny
grinned
in
triumph
get
ready
for
a
fast
ride
into
town
i
going
to
rush
this
evidence
straight
to
the
office
and
get
dad
opinion
chapter
blake
not
wishing
to
ride
to
the
building
louise
asked
her
chum
to
drop
her
off
at
the
sidell
home
accordingly
penny
left
her
there
and
then
drove
on
alone
to
her
father
office
the
news
room
hummed
with
activity
as
she
sauntered
through
to
the
private
office
just
a
minute
please
her
father
requested
waving
her
into
a
chair
he
completed
a
letter
he
was
dictating
dismissed
his
secretary
and
then
was
ready
to
listen
without
preliminary
ado
penny
laid
the
watch
charm
on
the
desk
explaining
where
she
had
found
it
dad
this
may
belong
to
clem
davis
but
i
do
think
so
she
announced
in
an
excited
voice
it
my
theory
that
the
person
who
planted
the
black
hood
in
the
stable
must
have
lost
it
parker
examined
the
charm
carefully
gazing
at
the
picture
of
the
little
boy
contained
within
it
very
interesting
he
commented
however
i
fear
you
are
allowing
your
imagination
to
take
you
for
a
ride
there
is
much
question
of
clem
davis
guilt
according
to
the
findings
of
the
sheriff
has
any
new
evidence
come
to
light
dad
yes
penny
the
sheriff
office
has
gained
possession
of
a
document
showing
beyond
question
that
clem
davis
is
a
member
of
a
renegade
band
known
as
the
black
hoods
where
did
they
get
their
proof
sheriff
davis
wo
disclose
the
source
of
his
information
however
our
star
reporter
jerry
livingston
is
working
on
the
case
and
something
may
develop
any
hour
then
you
intending
to
make
it
into
a
big
story
penny
asked
thoughtfully
i
am
an
underground
subversive
organization
no
matter
what
its
purpose
has
no
right
to
an
existence
the
will
expose
the
leaders
if
possible
and
break
up
the
group
since
the
hoods
apparently
burned
the
preston
storage
barn
their
purpose
ca
be
a
very
noble
one
penny
commented
nor
are
their
leaders
especially
clever
the
trail
led
as
plain
as
day
to
clem
davis
so
straight
in
fact
that
i
could
help
doubting
his
guilt
penny
i
keep
this
watch
charm
if
you
do
mind
parker
said
locking
the
trinket
into
a
drawer
i
put
jerry
to
work
on
it
and
he
may
be
able
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
little
boy
in
the
picture
abruptly
changing
the
subject
the
editor
inquired
regarding
his
daughter
success
in
selling
tags
i
have
only
one
left
penny
replied
presenting
it
with
a
flourish
cents
please
the
cause
is
a
worthy
one
i
double
the
amount
amiably
parker
flipped
a
half
dollar
across
the
desk
while
you
in
a
giving
mood
i
might
mention
that
my
allowance
is
due
penny
said
with
a
grin
also
you
owe
me
five
gallons
of
gasoline
i
saw
old
seth
mcguire
this
morning
and
he
agreed
with
me
that
the
hubell
clock
struck
thirteen
last
night
parker
had
no
opportunity
to
reply
for
just
then
his
secretary
the
office
to
say
that
clyde
blake
wished
to
see
him
i
suppose
that
means
you
want
me
to
evaporate
penny
remarked
gazing
questioningly
at
her
father
no
stay
if
you
like
it
probably
nothing
of
consequence
penny
welcomed
an
invitation
to
remain
after
her
talk
with
seth
mcguire
she
was
curious
to
see
the
man
who
had
caused
the
old
bell
maker
to
lose
his
position
at
the
hubell
tower
blake
probably
wants
to
ask
me
to
do
him
a
personal
favor
parker
confided
in
a
low
tone
he
a
pest
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
again
to
admit
the
real
estate
man
he
was
immaculately
dressed
and
the
only
defect
in
his
appearance
was
caused
by
a
right
arm
which
was
somewhat
shorter
than
the
left
good
afternoon
parker
he
said
expansively
and
is
this
your
charming
daughter
the
editor
introduced
penny
who
bowed
politely
and
retreated
to
a
chair
by
the
window
prejudiced
against
blake
she
had
no
desire
to
talk
to
him
what
may
i
do
for
you
parker
asked
the
caller
ah
this
time
it
is
i
who
shall
bestow
the
favor
blake
responded
taking
a
cheque
book
from
his
pocket
your
paper
has
been
campaigning
for
a
very
worthy
cause
namely
the
orphans
summer
camp
fund
it
wrings
my
heart
that
those
unfortunate
kiddies
have
been
denied
the
benefit
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
if
you
wish
to
make
a
donation
you
should
give
your
money
to
van
cleve
the
editor
cut
him
short
i
much
prefer
to
present
my
cheque
to
you
the
caller
insisted
shall
i
make
it
out
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
that
a
very
handsome
donation
said
parker
unable
to
hide
his
surprise
but
why
give
it
to
me
blake
coughed
in
embarrassment
i
thought
you
might
deem
the
offering
worthy
of
a
brief
mention
in
your
paper
oh
i
see
the
editor
responded
dryly
i
do
wish
publicity
for
myself
you
understand
but
only
for
the
real
estate
company
which
bears
my
name
i
quite
understand
blake
if
we
should
use
your
picture
that
will
be
very
acceptable
the
real
estate
man
responded
smiling
with
satisfaction
i
be
happy
to
oblige
you
by
posing
helping
himself
to
a
pen
he
wrote
out
the
cheque
and
presented
it
to
the
editor
penny
how
would
you
like
to
write
the
story
inquired
her
father
you
been
helping
miss
norton
with
the
publicity
i
believe
i
rather
bogged
down
with
work
penny
demurred
i
think
weems
wants
me
to
clean
the
attic
when
i
get
home
never
mind
the
attic
please
conduct
blake
to
the
photography
room
and
ask
one
of
the
boys
to
take
his
picture
penny
arose
obediently
but
as
the
real
estate
man
left
the
office
ahead
of
her
she
shot
her
father
a
black
look
she
considered
a
publicity
story
very
trivial
indeed
and
it
particularly
displeased
her
that
she
must
write
honeyed
words
about
a
man
she
did
not
admire
you
have
a
very
nice
building
here
very
nice
blake
patronizingly
remarked
as
he
was
escorted
toward
the
photographic
department
noticing
a
pile
of
freshly
printed
newspapers
lying
on
one
of
the
desks
he
helped
himself
to
a
copy
i
see
the
sheriff
has
captured
clem
davis
yet
he
commented
scanning
the
front
page
i
hope
they
get
him
it
a
disgrace
to
riverview
that
such
a
crime
could
be
perpetrated
and
the
scoundrel
go
unpunished
he
probably
be
caught
penny
replied
absently
but
i
wonder
if
the
guilty
person
what
that
blake
demanded
regarding
her
with
shrewd
interest
you
think
davis
did
burn
the
preston
barn
i
was
only
speculating
upon
it
reflecting
your
father
opinion
no
doubt
no
not
anyone
thought
but
my
own
your
father
seems
to
be
making
quite
a
story
of
it
blake
resumed
it
will
be
most
unfortunate
for
the
community
if
he
stirs
up
talk
about
underground
organizations
why
unfortunate
penny
asked
because
it
will
give
the
city
a
bad
reputation
i
doubt
there
is
anything
to
this
black
hood
talk
but
if
there
should
be
any
publicity
might
lead
to
an
investigation
by
state
authorities
a
very
good
thing
i
should
think
you
do
not
understand
blake
said
patiently
depredation
would
increase
innocent
persons
surely
would
suffer
with
riverview
known
unfavorably
throughout
the
country
we
would
gain
no
new
residents
penny
did
not
reply
but
opened
the
door
of
the
photographic
room
while
blake
wandered
about
inspecting
the
various
equipment
she
relayed
her
father
instructions
to
salt
sommers
one
of
the
staff
photographers
better
get
a
good
picture
of
blake
she
warned
him
he
be
irritated
if
you
do
i
do
my
best
salt
promised
but
i
ca
make
over
a
man
face
blake
proved
to
be
a
trying
subject
posed
on
a
stool
in
front
of
a
screen
he
immediately
froze
into
a
stiff
position
be
sure
to
make
it
only
a
head
and
shoulders
picture
if
you
please
he
ordered
salt
ca
you
relax
the
photographer
asked
wearily
unloosen
your
face
think
of
all
those
little
orphans
you
going
to
make
happy
blake
responded
with
a
smirk
which
was
painful
to
behold
nothing
that
salt
could
say
or
do
caused
him
to
become
natural
and
at
length
the
photographer
took
two
shots
which
he
knew
would
not
be
satisfactory
that
be
all
he
announced
blake
arose
drawing
a
deep
sigh
posing
is
a
great
ordeal
for
me
he
confessed
i
seldom
consent
to
having
my
picture
taken
but
this
is
a
very
special
occasion
completely
at
ease
again
the
real
estate
man
began
to
converse
with
penny
in
sudden
inspiration
salt
seized
a
candid
camera
from
a
glass
case
and
before
blake
was
aware
of
his
act
snapped
a
picture
there
that
more
like
it
he
said
i
caught
you
just
right
mr
blake
the
real
estate
man
turned
swiftly
his
eyes
blazing
anger
you
dared
to
take
a
picture
without
my
permission
he
demanded
not
have
it
destroy
the
film
at
once
or
i
shall
protest
to
mr
parker
chapter
by
the
real
estate
man
outburst
was
so
unexpected
that
penny
and
salt
could
only
stare
at
him
in
astonishment
it
a
good
full
length
picture
the
photographer
argued
much
better
than
those
other
shots
i
took
i
ca
allow
it
blake
answered
in
a
calmer
tone
he
touched
his
right
arm
you
see
i
am
sensitive
about
this
deformity
unreasonable
of
me
perhaps
but
i
must
insist
that
you
destroy
the
film
just
as
you
say
salt
shrugged
we
use
one
of
the
other
pictures
no
i
changed
my
mind
blake
said
shortly
i
do
care
for
any
picture
kindly
destroy
all
the
films
now
in
my
presence
why
mr
blake
penny
protested
i
thought
you
wanted
a
picture
to
accompany
the
story
i
am
to
write
you
may
write
the
article
but
i
have
no
picture
the
films
must
be
destroyed
okay
responded
salt
removing
two
plates
from
a
holder
he
exposed
them
to
the
light
he
started
to
take
the
film
from
the
candid
camera
but
did
not
complete
the
operation
blake
however
failed
to
notice
thank
you
young
man
he
said
bowing
i
am
sorry
to
have
taken
so
much
of
your
valuable
time
and
i
appreciate
your
efforts
nodding
in
penny
direction
blake
left
the
studio
closing
the
door
behind
him
queer
duck
commented
salt
his
picture
on
the
front
page
would
be
no
break
for
our
readers
i
ca
understand
why
blake
became
so
provoked
penny
said
thoughtfully
that
excuse
about
his
arm
seemed
a
flimsy
one
let
develop
the
film
and
see
what
it
looks
like
salt
suggested
starting
for
the
darkroom
it
was
just
an
ordinary
shot
though
penny
followed
the
young
photographer
into
the
developing
room
watching
as
he
ran
the
film
through
the
various
trays
in
exactly
six
minutes
the
picture
was
ready
and
he
held
it
beneath
the
ruby
light
for
her
to
see
nothing
unusual
about
it
he
repeated
blake
right
arm
looks
a
bit
shorter
than
the
left
but
we
could
have
blocked
that
off
salt
tossed
the
damp
picture
into
a
wastepaper
basket
only
to
have
penny
promptly
rescue
it
i
wish
you
would
save
this
she
requested
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
file
it
away
somewhere
in
the
office
what
the
big
idea
penny
oh
just
a
hunch
i
guess
someday
the
paper
may
want
a
picture
of
blake
in
a
hurry
and
this
one
would
serve
very
nicely
aware
that
time
was
fast
slipping
away
penny
returned
to
her
office
to
report
blake
strange
action
parker
well
versed
in
the
peculiarities
of
newspaper
patrons
shrugged
indifferently
blake
always
was
a
queer
fellow
he
commented
fingering
the
cheque
which
still
lay
on
his
desk
i
never
trusted
him
and
i
wish
i
accepted
this
money
how
could
you
have
refused
dad
i
could
very
well
all
the
same
i
have
a
feeling
i
regret
it
why
do
you
say
that
penny
asked
curiously
no
reason
perhaps
only
blake
is
the
man
to
give
something
for
nothing
he
aims
to
profit
by
this
affair
or
i
no
judge
of
human
nature
he
craves
publicity
that
certain
yes
but
there
more
to
it
than
that
parker
declared
oh
well
he
dismissed
the
subject
i
turn
the
cheque
over
to
the
camp
committee
and
let
someone
else
do
the
worrying
i
tell
you
why
i
dislike
blake
penny
said
with
feeling
he
caused
seth
mcguire
to
lose
his
job
at
the
hubell
tower
that
so
the
editor
asked
in
surprise
i
had
heard
about
it
blake
gave
the
position
to
a
special
friend
of
his
ca
you
do
something
about
it
dad
i
do
know
any
of
the
basic
facts
penny
why
should
i
interfere
in
a
matter
which
is
none
of
my
affair
at
least
let
not
give
blake
a
big
because
of
his
donation
the
story
must
be
written
parker
said
with
finality
i
always
keep
a
bargain
even
a
bad
one
then
you
might
write
the
story
penny
proposed
mischievously
i
spell
such
a
big
word
as
hypocrite
never
mind
parker
reproved
just
get
busy
and
see
that
you
handle
the
article
in
a
way
favorable
to
blake
with
a
deep
sigh
penny
took
herself
to
the
adjoining
newsroom
selecting
a
typewriter
she
pecked
listlessly
at
the
keys
presently
jerry
livingston
one
of
the
reporters
fired
a
paper
ball
at
her
your
story
must
be
a
masterpiece
he
teased
it
taken
you
long
enough
to
write
it
penny
jerked
the
sheet
of
copy
from
the
typewriter
roller
it
not
fair
she
complained
i
have
to
dish
out
soft
soap
while
you
handle
all
the
interesting
stories
there
should
be
a
law
against
it
learn
to
take
the
bitter
along
with
the
whipped
cream
chuckled
jerry
i
also
just
been
handed
an
assignment
that
not
to
my
liking
covering
the
preston
fire
i
suppose
nothing
that
spectacular
dewitt
sending
me
out
to
the
riverview
orphans
home
to
dig
up
human
interest
material
in
connection
with
the
campaign
want
to
ride
along
as
ballast
well
i
do
know
penny
debated
i
had
almost
enough
of
publicity
stories
for
one
day
oh
come
on
jerry
coaxed
taking
her
by
the
arm
you
can
talk
to
the
orphans
and
maybe
turn
up
a
lot
of
interesting
facts
for
you
to
write
she
added
ruefully
just
a
sister
friday
that
my
fate
in
this
office
actually
penny
welcomed
an
opportunity
to
accompany
jerry
for
she
liked
him
better
than
any
young
man
of
her
acquaintance
spearing
the
story
she
had
just
written
on
the
copy
desk
spindle
she
followed
the
reporter
to
the
parking
lot
jerry
helped
her
into
one
of
the
press
cars
and
they
expertly
drove
through
heavy
downtown
traffic
what
the
latest
on
the
preston
case
penny
inquired
clutching
her
hat
to
keep
it
from
blowing
out
the
window
no
latest
jerry
answered
briefly
the
prestons
wo
talk
davis
wo
talk
the
sheriff
wo
talk
so
far
it
totals
up
to
one
little
story
about
a
fire
dad
said
the
sheriff
had
learned
clem
davis
was
a
member
of
a
secret
organization
probably
known
as
the
black
hoods
sheriff
daniels
claims
he
has
documentary
proof
jerry
admitted
he
wo
produce
it
though
and
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
he
may
be
bluffing
then
you
think
he
wants
to
convict
clem
davis
whether
or
not
guilty
he
wants
to
end
the
case
just
as
quickly
as
he
can
penny
the
november
elections
are
far
away
if
this
night
rider
story
gets
a
start
the
dear
public
might
turn
on
him
demanding
action
or
his
job
do
you
think
there
actually
is
such
an
organization
as
the
black
hoods
jerry
i
do
he
returned
soberly
after
talking
with
the
prestons
and
davis
i
convinced
they
could
tell
quite
a
bit
about
it
if
they
were
willing
to
furnish
evidence
it
pleased
penny
that
jerry
opinion
so
nearly
coincided
with
her
own
eagerly
she
told
him
of
her
own
talk
with
davis
mentioning
that
someone
had
been
hiding
in
the
cornfield
near
the
cabin
what
time
was
that
jerry
asked
stopping
the
car
at
a
traffic
light
shortly
after
twelve
then
it
could
have
been
sheriff
daniels
or
his
deputies
the
reporter
declared
i
was
at
the
county
office
talking
to
them
about
that
same
time
it
might
have
been
clem
davis
penny
suggested
i
sure
his
wife
knows
where
he
is
hiding
as
the
car
sped
over
the
country
road
she
kept
the
discussion
alive
by
mentioning
the
watch
charm
which
she
had
picked
up
at
the
davis
stable
jerry
had
not
seen
the
picture
of
the
little
boy
but
promised
to
inspect
it
just
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
the
offices
clem
davis
has
no
children
he
assured
penny
so
it
unlikely
the
charm
ever
belonged
to
him
you
may
have
found
an
important
clue
i
only
wish
dad
would
officially
assign
me
to
the
story
she
grumbled
he
never
will
though
presently
the
car
approached
the
riverview
orphans
home
a
large
brick
building
set
back
some
distance
from
the
road
children
in
drab
blue
uniforms
could
be
seen
playing
in
the
front
yard
supervised
by
a
woman
official
poor
kids
jerry
said
with
honest
feeling
you
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
they
deserve
the
best
summer
camp
this
town
can
provide
the
project
is
certain
to
be
possible
now
penny
replied
cheque
put
the
campaign
over
the
top
jerry
gave
the
steering
wheel
an
expert
flip
turning
the
car
into
the
private
road
do
tell
me
that
old
bird
actually
parted
with
any
money
oh
he
did
jerry
he
donated
a
cheque
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
and
no
strings
attached
well
he
hinted
that
he
wanted
a
nice
about
himself
i
was
torturing
myself
with
the
story
when
you
interrupted
it
mighty
queer
the
reporter
muttered
leopards
do
change
their
spots
blake
must
expect
something
more
tangible
than
publicity
out
of
the
deal
his
mind
centering
on
what
penny
had
just
told
him
jerry
gave
no
thought
to
his
driving
handling
the
steering
wheel
skillfully
but
automatically
he
whirled
the
car
into
the
play
area
of
the
institution
drawing
up
with
a
loud
screeching
of
brakes
uncertain
that
the
reporter
could
stop
the
children
scattered
in
all
directions
one
little
girl
remained
squarely
in
front
of
the
car
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
began
to
scream
gosh
all
fish
hooks
jerry
exclaimed
in
dismay
i
did
mean
to
frighten
the
kid
jumping
from
the
coupe
he
and
penny
ran
to
the
child
you
all
right
jerry
said
stooping
beside
the
little
girl
the
car
did
come
within
a
mile
of
you
i
mighty
sorry
nothing
that
either
he
nor
penny
could
say
seemed
to
quiet
the
child
her
screams
did
not
subside
until
a
matron
appeared
and
took
her
by
the
hand
come
adelle
she
said
gently
we
go
into
the
house
i
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
jerry
apologized
doffing
his
hat
i
intend
to
drive
into
the
yard
so
fast
it
all
my
fault
the
attendant
smiled
to
set
him
at
ease
do
mind
she
said
quietly
adelle
is
very
easily
upset
i
explain
to
you
later
chapter
both
penny
and
jerry
regretted
the
incident
feeling
that
they
had
been
at
fault
because
they
had
driven
into
the
play
area
at
such
high
speed
maybe
i
can
send
the
kid
a
box
of
candy
or
make
it
up
to
her
in
some
way
the
reporter
remarked
roving
about
the
yard
he
and
penny
talked
to
many
of
the
orphans
nearly
all
of
the
children
answered
questions
and
had
little
to
say
we
not
get
much
of
a
story
here
jerry
commented
in
an
undertone
these
youngsters
are
as
much
alike
as
if
they
had
been
cut
from
one
pattern
adelle
was
different
penny
returned
with
a
smile
almost
too
much
so
in
a
short
while
miss
anderson
the
young
woman
who
had
taken
the
child
away
returned
to
the
play
yard
penny
and
jerry
immediately
inquired
about
the
little
girl
oh
she
is
quite
herself
again
the
young
woman
responded
the
upset
was
only
a
temporary
one
is
adelle
easily
frightened
penny
inquired
curiously
unfortunately
she
is
terrified
of
automobiles
responded
miss
anderson
i
am
afraid
it
is
becoming
a
complex
you
see
about
a
year
ago
both
of
her
parents
were
killed
in
a
motor
accident
how
dreadful
penny
gasped
adelle
was
in
the
car
but
escaped
with
a
broken
leg
the
young
woman
resumed
the
incident
made
a
very
deep
impression
upon
her
i
should
think
so
exclaimed
jerry
how
did
the
accident
occur
we
do
know
exactly
for
adelle
was
the
only
witness
according
to
her
story
the
hanover
automobile
was
crowded
off
the
road
by
another
motorist
who
drove
at
reckless
speed
without
lights
the
car
upset
pinning
the
occupants
beneath
it
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
that
story
jerry
said
thoughtfully
the
driver
never
was
caught
no
according
to
adelle
he
stopped
only
to
drive
on
again
when
he
saw
that
her
parents
were
beyond
help
the
man
must
have
been
heartless
penny
declared
indignantly
how
could
he
run
away
because
he
feared
the
consequences
miss
anderson
answered
had
he
been
apprehended
he
would
have
faced
charges
for
manslaughter
and
undoubtedly
would
have
been
assessed
heavy
damages
i
take
it
the
child
has
no
property
or
she
would
be
at
this
institution
jerry
said
soberly
adelle
is
penniless
her
parents
were
her
only
relatives
so
she
was
brought
to
us
it
a
shame
penny
declared
feelingly
was
there
any
clue
as
to
the
identity
of
the
man
who
caused
the
fatal
accident
no
worthwhile
ones
adelle
insists
that
she
saw
the
driver
face
plainly
and
could
recognize
him
again
however
she
never
was
able
to
give
a
very
good
description
nor
to
make
an
identification
having
heard
the
story
jerry
was
more
than
ever
annoyed
at
himself
because
he
had
caused
the
child
needless
suffering
miss
anderson
is
there
something
i
can
do
to
make
amends
he
asked
earnestly
what
would
the
little
girl
like
candy
toys
it
is
necessary
that
you
give
her
anything
i
want
to
do
it
jerry
insisted
in
that
case
why
not
make
some
small
bequest
to
the
institution
or
send
something
which
may
be
enjoyed
by
all
the
children
jerry
i
have
an
idea
cried
penny
impulsively
why
not
give
a
party
would
that
be
permissible
miss
anderson
indeed
yes
the
children
love
them
and
outings
away
from
the
institution
are
their
special
delight
let
give
a
watermelon
party
penny
proposed
immediately
considering
herself
jerry
partner
in
the
affair
we
could
take
the
children
to
a
nearby
farm
and
let
them
gorge
themselves
the
children
would
enjoy
it
i
sure
miss
anderson
smiled
can
transportation
be
arranged
we
have
sixty
boys
and
girls
i
take
care
of
everything
jerry
promised
suppose
we
set
tomorrow
afternoon
as
the
date
oh
ca
we
have
the
party
at
night
penny
pleaded
there
will
be
a
full
moon
a
watermelon
feast
would
be
much
fun
by
daylight
miss
anderson
replied
that
she
thought
the
children
might
be
allowed
to
attend
such
a
party
providing
it
were
held
early
in
the
evening
penny
and
jerry
talked
with
her
about
various
details
of
the
plan
and
then
drove
away
from
the
institution
well
you
certainly
got
me
into
something
jerry
chuckled
as
the
car
turned
into
the
main
road
where
are
we
going
to
throw
this
party
oh
any
melon
farmer
will
be
glad
to
let
the
children
invade
his
patch
providing
we
pay
for
the
privilege
penny
answered
carelessly
you
might
turn
in
at
the
next
farm
her
confidence
proved
to
be
for
kahler
the
farmer
whom
they
accosted
would
not
consider
the
proposition
the
children
will
trample
the
vines
and
do
a
lot
of
damage
he
declined
why
do
you
try
the
wentover
place
at
the
wentover
farm
jerry
and
penny
likewise
were
turned
down
no
one
wants
sixty
orphans
running
rampant
over
his
place
the
reporter
observed
in
discouragement
we
may
as
well
give
up
the
idea
it
possible
davis
would
allow
us
to
hold
a
muskmelon
party
at
her
farm
penny
replied
thoughtfully
now
that
her
husband
has
skipped
she
must
be
in
need
of
money
the
chance
of
success
seemed
unlikely
however
to
please
penny
jerry
drove
to
the
davis
property
to
their
surprise
they
found
the
place
humming
with
activity
professional
melon
pickers
were
at
work
in
the
patch
and
davis
dressed
in
overalls
was
personally
supervising
the
laborers
i
have
no
time
to
answer
questions
she
announced
to
jerry
before
he
could
speak
please
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
oh
i
not
here
in
an
official
capacity
this
time
the
reporter
grinned
we
want
to
make
you
a
business
proposition
he
then
explained
what
he
had
in
mind
davis
listened
attentively
but
with
suspicion
it
likely
some
trick
she
declared
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
davis
we
not
trying
to
deceive
you
penny
interposed
earnestly
we
tried
several
other
farms
before
we
came
here
no
one
is
willing
to
let
the
children
trample
the
vines
i
suppose
it
would
hurt
mine
the
woman
admitted
by
tomorrow
night
we
have
all
the
best
melons
picked
and
sorted
i
reckon
the
youngsters
can
have
what
left
in
the
patch
we
pay
you
well
for
the
privilege
jerry
promised
taking
out
his
wallet
i
do
want
your
money
the
woman
answered
shortly
just
see
to
it
that
the
youngsters
do
tear
up
the
place
neither
penny
nor
jerry
wished
to
accept
such
a
favor
but
davis
firmly
refused
to
take
pay
you
know
i
think
the
old
girl
has
a
tender
heart
beneath
a
hard
exterior
the
reporter
remarked
after
the
woman
had
gone
back
to
the
patch
down
under
she
a
pretty
decent
sort
for
a
time
penny
and
jerry
watched
the
laborers
at
their
work
heaping
baskets
of
melons
were
brought
from
the
patch
to
the
barn
there
they
were
sorted
stamped
and
packed
into
crates
which
were
loaded
into
a
truck
nice
looking
melons
the
reporter
remarked
davis
should
make
a
pretty
fair
profit
an
elderly
workman
who
was
sorting
melons
glanced
sideways
at
jerry
grinning
in
a
knowing
way
maybe
he
said
what
do
you
mean
by
that
jerry
questioned
him
sellin
melons
is
a
speculative
business
the
old
fellow
shrugged
you
ai
sure
o
anything
until
your
harvest
is
sold
and
you
get
the
money
in
your
fist
penny
and
jerry
watched
the
sorting
work
for
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
returned
to
the
car
you
know
for
a
minute
i
thought
that
old
duffer
was
hinting
at
something
the
reporter
remarked
he
acted
as
if
it
would
give
him
real
pleasure
to
see
something
happen
to
davis
melons
oh
i
did
take
it
that
way
penny
responded
he
was
only
waxing
philosophical
the
hour
was
late
knowing
that
he
might
be
wanted
at
the
office
jerry
drove
rather
fast
over
the
bumpy
road
as
the
press
car
sped
around
a
bend
a
man
who
stood
leaning
against
a
fence
post
quickly
retreated
into
the
woods
his
act
however
had
drawn
penny
attention
stop
the
car
jerry
she
cried
there
he
is
again
who
demanded
the
reporter
slamming
on
brakes
i
think
it
the
same
man
who
hid
in
the
cornfield
penny
exclaimed
excitedly
it
must
be
clem
davis
chapter
the
melon
which
way
did
the
fellow
go
jerry
demanded
bringing
the
car
to
a
standstill
into
the
woods
penny
answered
tersely
leaping
from
the
automobile
they
climbed
a
fence
and
reached
the
edge
of
the
woods
pausing
there
they
listened
intently
no
sound
could
be
heard
not
even
the
crackling
of
a
stick
this
timber
land
extends
for
miles
said
jerry
we
only
waste
time
playing
hide
and
seek
in
there
our
best
bet
is
to
notify
sheriff
daniels
and
let
him
throw
a
net
around
the
entire
section
i
guess
you
right
penny
acknowledged
regretfully
making
all
haste
to
riverview
they
stopped
briefly
at
the
office
to
make
their
report
penny
then
said
goodbye
to
jerry
and
went
to
the
newspaper
building
where
she
had
parked
leaping
lena
the
car
would
not
start
experienced
in
such
matters
penny
raised
the
hood
and
posed
beside
it
a
picture
of
a
young
lady
in
deep
distress
soon
a
cruised
along
having
trouble
sister
the
driver
asked
penny
slammed
down
the
hood
and
scrambled
into
leaping
lena
just
give
me
a
little
push
she
instructed
briskly
obligingly
the
taxi
driver
backed
into
position
behind
leaping
lena
after
the
two
cars
had
gathered
speed
penny
shifted
gears
lena
responded
with
an
ailing
cough
and
then
a
steady
chug
thanks
penny
shouted
waving
farewell
to
her
benefactor
i
return
the
favor
someday
not
with
that
mess
of
junk
the
taxi
man
laughed
by
keeping
the
motor
running
at
high
speed
penny
reached
home
without
mishap
her
father
had
arrived
ahead
of
her
she
noted
for
the
maroon
car
had
been
put
away
for
the
night
locking
the
garage
doors
penny
entered
the
house
by
way
of
the
kitchen
where
dad
she
asked
the
housekeeper
absently
helping
herself
to
a
freshly
baked
cookie
listen
and
i
think
you
can
tell
weems
answered
a
loud
hammering
noise
came
from
the
basement
inspired
by
an
advertisement
of
waldon
oak
paneling
parker
had
decided
to
wall
up
the
recreation
room
without
the
services
of
a
carpenter
much
of
his
spare
time
was
spent
carrying
on
a
personal
feud
with
boards
which
refused
to
fit
into
the
right
places
poor
dad
penny
grinned
as
she
heard
a
particularly
loud
exclamation
of
wrath
i
go
down
and
drip
a
few
consoling
words
descending
the
stairs
she
stood
watching
her
father
from
the
doorway
of
the
recreation
room
hello
penny
he
said
looking
over
his
shoulder
you
may
as
well
make
yourself
useful
hold
this
board
while
i
nail
it
in
place
all
right
but
be
careful
where
you
pound
remember
i
have
only
two
hands
and
i
prize
them
both
with
penny
holding
the
board
parker
nailed
it
to
the
underpinning
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
job
he
asked
standing
back
to
admire
his
work
as
a
carpenter
you
a
very
good
editor
penny
answered
with
exaggerated
politeness
are
walls
supposed
to
come
together
at
the
corners
i
made
a
little
mistake
in
my
calculations
later
on
i
may
build
a
corner
cupboard
to
cover
up
the
slight
gap
slight
penny
chuckled
dad
if
i
were
you
i
would
get
tangled
up
in
any
more
carpenter
jobs
it
too
hard
on
your
disposition
i
never
was
in
a
better
mood
in
my
life
parker
insisted
good
reason
too
at
last
i
got
the
best
of
ben
bowman
bowman
penny
inquired
in
a
puzzled
tone
that
crank
who
keeps
sending
me
collect
messages
oh
to
be
sure
i
forgotten
about
him
he
sent
another
telegram
today
parker
declared
smiling
grimly
i
suspected
it
came
from
him
and
refused
to
pay
for
it
bravo
penny
approved
i
knew
you
could
get
the
best
of
that
fellow
if
you
just
put
your
mind
to
it
on
the
floor
above
a
telephone
rang
but
neither
of
them
paid
any
heed
knowing
that
weems
would
answer
in
a
moment
the
housekeeper
called
down
the
stairway
telling
parker
he
was
wanted
on
the
it
dewitt
from
the
office
she
informed
him
putting
aside
his
hammer
parker
went
upstairs
soon
he
returned
to
the
basement
his
manner
noticeably
subdued
what
the
matter
dad
penny
inquired
curiously
you
look
as
if
you
had
just
received
a
stunning
blow
dewitt
telephoned
to
tell
me
the
lost
an
important
story
today
how
did
that
happen
dad
well
a
correspondent
wired
in
the
news
but
by
accident
the
message
never
reached
dewitt
desk
penny
regarded
her
father
shrewdly
ben
bowman
telegram
i
afraid
it
was
parker
admitted
the
message
came
to
two
dollars
i
did
know
dewitt
had
hired
a
correspondent
at
the
town
of
altona
naturally
i
jumped
to
conclusions
so
you
lost
a
news
story
because
you
refused
a
bona
fide
telegram
penny
said
shaking
her
head
ben
bowman
scores
again
you
see
what
i
up
against
the
editor
growled
i
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
be
rid
of
that
pest
you
really
mean
it
penny
demanded
with
interest
my
peace
of
mind
would
be
well
worth
the
price
in
that
case
i
may
apply
my
own
brain
to
the
task
i
could
use
a
hundred
dollars
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
weems
who
called
that
dinner
was
ready
as
parker
went
to
his
usual
place
at
the
dining
room
table
he
saw
a
yellow
envelope
lying
on
his
plate
what
this
he
demanded
sharply
a
telegram
explained
weems
it
came
only
a
moment
ago
i
paid
the
boy
how
much
was
the
message
the
editor
asked
his
face
grim
a
dollar
and
a
half
weems
regarded
her
employer
anxiously
did
i
do
anything
i
should
have
i
supposed
of
course
you
would
want
me
to
accept
the
message
this
is
just
too
too
good
penny
chuckled
thoroughly
enjoying
the
situation
everything
so
perfectly
timed
almost
as
if
it
were
a
play
i
do
understand
weems
murmured
i
done
something
i
should
it
was
not
your
fault
parker
assured
her
in
the
future
however
refuse
to
accept
any
collect
message
as
her
father
did
not
open
the
telegram
penny
seized
upon
it
this
is
from
a
man
who
calls
himself
isaac
fulterton
she
disclosed
glancing
at
the
bottom
of
the
typed
page
merely
one
of
ben
bowman
many
names
parker
sighed
ah
this
is
a
gem
penny
chuckled
and
read
aloud
is
a
suggestion
for
your
rotten
rag
why
not
print
it
on
yellow
paper
i
know
you
will
not
use
it
because
editors
think
they
know
everything
i
once
knew
a
reader
who
got
a
little
good
out
of
your
paper
he
used
it
to
clean
the
garbage
can
how
dreadful
weems
exclaimed
genuinely
shocked
penny
if
you
insist
upon
reading
another
line
i
shall
leave
the
table
parker
snapped
i
had
quite
enough
of
ben
bowman
i
sorry
dad
penny
apologized
slipping
the
message
into
her
pocket
i
can
appreciate
that
this
does
seem
very
funny
to
you
the
telegram
was
not
mentioned
again
nevertheless
parker
good
humor
had
given
way
to
moody
silence
contributing
no
cheer
to
the
evening
meal
weems
kept
glancing
uneasily
at
her
employer
wondering
if
she
had
offended
him
only
penny
whose
appetite
never
failed
seemed
thoroughly
at
ease
dad
she
said
suddenly
i
have
an
idea
how
ben
bowman
might
be
trailed
never
mind
telling
me
her
father
answered
i
prefer
not
to
hear
his
name
mentioned
as
you
like
she
shrugged
i
shroud
myself
in
mystery
and
silence
as
i
work
but
when
the
case
is
ended
i
present
my
bill
actually
penny
held
slight
hope
that
ever
she
would
be
able
to
turn
the
elusive
ben
bowman
over
to
the
police
the
wily
fellow
was
far
too
clever
ever
to
file
two
messages
from
the
same
telegraph
office
and
very
seldom
from
the
same
city
however
the
town
of
claymore
from
which
the
last
message
had
been
sent
was
only
miles
away
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
by
going
there
she
might
obtain
from
telegraph
officials
the
original
message
filed
in
that
way
i
at
least
have
ben
bowman
signature
she
reflected
while
it
would
be
much
it
represents
a
start
always
penny
greatest
problem
was
insufficient
time
greatly
as
she
desired
to
drive
to
claymore
she
knew
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
for
several
days
not
only
must
arrangements
for
the
orphans
melon
party
be
completed
but
other
interests
demanded
attention
temporarily
dismissing
ben
bowman
from
her
mind
penny
devoted
herself
to
plans
for
the
outing
cars
easily
were
obtained
and
the
following
night
sixty
excited
orphans
were
transported
to
the
davis
farm
with
shrieks
of
laughter
the
boys
and
girls
took
possession
of
the
melon
patch
pick
all
you
like
from
the
vines
penny
called
but
do
touch
any
of
the
crated
ones
in
the
yard
not
far
from
the
storage
barn
stood
a
truck
loaded
with
melons
which
were
ready
for
the
market
this
must
represent
the
cream
of
preston
crop
jerry
remarked
lifting
the
canvas
which
covered
the
load
maybe
she
be
luckier
than
her
neighbors
the
doolittles
what
happened
to
them
penny
asked
surprised
by
the
remark
do
you
ever
read
the
i
did
today
too
busy
tell
me
about
the
doolittles
jerry
doolittle
was
taking
a
load
of
melons
to
market
another
truck
brushed
him
on
the
river
road
the
melon
truck
upset
and
the
entire
shipment
was
lost
ca
he
get
damages
doolittle
did
learn
who
was
responsible
was
it
an
accident
or
done
deliberately
penny
asked
thoughtfully
sheriff
daniels
thinks
it
was
an
accident
i
inclined
to
believe
the
black
hoods
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
why
should
anyone
wish
to
make
trouble
for
doolittle
jerry
all
his
life
he
has
stayed
on
his
little
truck
farm
and
strictly
attended
to
his
own
affairs
there
only
one
possible
reason
so
far
as
i
know
the
reporter
answered
not
long
ago
doolittle
refused
to
join
the
holloway
county
cooperative
an
organization
that
markets
crops
for
the
truck
farmers
and
you
believe
the
hoods
may
be
connected
with
the
cooperative
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
jerry
replied
hastily
fact
is
the
holloway
cooperative
always
has
had
a
good
reputation
there
no
question
the
preston
barn
was
destroyed
by
the
hoods
penny
said
reflectively
although
the
evidence
pointed
to
clem
davis
never
felt
satisfied
he
was
guilty
same
here
agreed
jerry
another
thing
i
keep
mulling
over
what
that
melon
sorter
said
yesterday
you
mean
his
hint
that
something
might
happen
to
davis
crop
yeah
maybe
he
knew
more
than
he
let
on
the
hoods
will
have
to
work
fast
if
they
destroy
the
davis
melons
penny
rejoined
besides
did
the
sheriff
uncover
proof
that
clem
davis
is
a
member
of
the
organization
that
what
he
says
i
wonder
about
that
too
not
far
from
the
truck
was
a
small
pile
of
discarded
melons
culls
which
were
misshapen
or
selecting
one
jerry
tossed
it
into
the
air
and
caught
it
just
the
right
size
for
a
hand
grenade
he
remarked
watch
he
threw
the
melon
hard
against
the
barn
it
burst
against
the
siding
breaking
into
a
dozen
fragments
and
leaving
an
unsightly
blotch
of
oozing
seeds
jerry
you
should
do
that
penny
chided
davis
wo
like
it
okay
i
be
good
the
reporter
promised
the
temptation
was
just
too
strong
to
resist
by
this
time
the
hubbub
in
the
melon
patch
had
slightly
subsided
as
the
youngsters
gained
their
fill
of
cantaloupe
soon
institution
officials
began
to
pilot
the
children
to
the
waiting
cars
several
lads
protested
at
the
early
termination
of
the
party
do
let
the
boys
stay
awhile
longer
penny
pleaded
jerry
and
i
will
bring
them
back
in
a
few
minutes
very
well
the
matron
consented
but
do
allow
them
to
eat
so
many
melons
that
they
will
be
sick
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
six
orphans
weighed
heavily
upon
penny
after
the
cars
had
driven
away
she
and
jerry
patrolled
the
patch
trying
vainly
to
maintain
order
with
institution
authorities
no
longer
present
the
boys
proceeded
to
enjoy
themselves
they
ran
races
down
the
furrows
lassoed
one
another
with
vines
and
pelted
ripe
melons
against
the
fence
posts
hey
you
little
hoodlums
jerry
shouted
cut
it
out
or
you
go
back
to
the
home
pronto
says
who
mocked
one
saucy
little
fellow
in
a
piping
voice
quiet
everyone
commanded
penny
suddenly
listen
in
the
silent
night
could
be
heard
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
jerry
whirled
around
gazing
toward
the
entrance
to
the
lane
two
horsemen
black
hoods
covering
their
faces
rode
at
a
hard
gallop
toward
the
storage
barn
chapter
the
nightshirt
riders
jerry
exclaimed
duck
down
everyone
penny
and
the
six
lads
from
the
riverview
home
crouched
low
watching
the
approach
of
the
two
riders
one
of
those
men
may
be
clem
davis
but
i
doubt
it
muttered
jerry
they
here
to
destroy
the
crated
cantaloupes
jerry
we
ca
let
them
get
away
with
it
penny
exclaimed
why
not
pelt
them
with
melons
when
they
get
closer
okay
he
agreed
grimly
we
give
a
spoiled
cantaloupe
blitz
gather
your
ammunition
gang
and
get
ready
screened
from
the
approaching
horsemen
by
trees
and
bushes
the
young
people
hastily
collected
a
few
cantaloupes
which
were
small
enough
to
throw
with
accuracy
unaware
of
the
barrage
awaiting
them
the
two
hooded
men
rode
into
the
yard
now
jerry
gave
the
signal
let
have
it
taking
careful
aim
he
hurled
his
own
melon
with
all
his
strength
it
found
its
mark
striking
one
of
the
men
with
stunning
force
nearly
causing
him
to
fall
from
the
saddle
penny
and
the
boys
from
the
orphans
home
concentrated
their
efforts
on
the
other
horseman
while
many
of
their
shots
were
wild
a
few
went
true
one
struck
the
horse
which
reared
suddenly
on
her
hind
legs
unseating
the
rider
give
it
to
him
jerry
shouted
observing
that
the
fallen
man
was
unhurt
handicapped
by
lack
of
ammunition
there
followed
a
brief
lull
in
the
battle
as
the
young
people
sought
to
replenish
their
stock
seizing
the
opportunity
one
of
the
night
riders
galloped
away
the
other
man
who
had
lost
his
horse
scrambled
into
the
cab
of
the
loaded
melon
truck
he
going
to
drive
off
penny
cried
let
stop
him
she
and
jerry
ran
toward
the
truck
but
they
were
too
late
the
giant
motor
started
with
a
roar
and
the
heavy
vehicle
rolled
out
of
the
yard
just
then
davis
came
running
from
the
cabin
my
melons
she
screamed
they
taken
my
melons
oh
i
was
afraid
something
like
this
would
happen
maybe
i
can
overtake
that
fellow
jerry
called
to
her
ride
herd
on
these
kids
until
i
get
back
as
he
ran
toward
his
own
car
penny
was
close
at
his
heels
she
slid
into
the
seat
beside
him
and
they
raced
down
the
lane
which
way
did
the
truck
go
jerry
demanded
i
was
so
excited
i
forgot
to
notice
it
turned
right
no
sign
of
it
now
though
the
fellow
is
running
without
lights
to
make
it
harder
for
us
to
follow
him
jerry
and
penny
both
were
hopeful
that
they
could
overtake
the
truck
which
carried
a
heavy
load
however
they
had
been
delayed
several
minutes
in
getting
started
and
as
the
miles
fell
behind
them
they
caught
no
glimpse
of
the
man
they
pursued
he
must
have
turned
off
on
that
little
side
road
we
passed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
penny
declared
in
discouragement
switch
off
the
engine
a
minute
bringing
the
car
to
a
standstill
jerry
did
as
instructed
both
listened
intently
from
far
over
the
hills
they
thought
they
could
hear
the
muffled
roar
of
a
powerful
motor
you
right
penny
he
turned
off
at
that
side
road
jerry
exclaimed
backing
the
coupe
around
we
get
him
yet
retracing
their
route
they
started
down
the
narrow
rutty
highway
five
minutes
later
rounding
a
sharp
bend
they
caught
their
first
glimpse
of
the
truck
a
dark
object
silhouetted
in
the
moonlight
only
for
a
moment
did
it
remain
visible
and
then
descending
a
hill
was
lost
to
view
we
gaining
fast
jerry
said
in
satisfaction
it
wo
be
long
now
the
coupe
rattled
over
a
bridge
for
no
reason
at
all
it
began
to
bump
a
loud
pounding
noise
coming
from
the
rear
of
the
car
gracious
what
now
penny
exclaimed
a
flat
jerry
answered
tersely
just
our
luck
pulling
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
he
jumped
out
to
peer
at
the
tires
as
he
had
feared
the
left
rear
one
was
down
we
probably
lose
that
fellow
now
he
said
irritably
with
penny
holding
a
flashlight
the
reporter
worked
as
fast
as
he
could
to
change
the
tire
however
nearly
fifteen
minutes
elapsed
before
the
task
had
been
accomplished
we
may
as
well
turn
back
he
said
tossing
tools
into
the
back
of
the
car
how
about
it
oh
let
keep
on
a
little
farther
penny
pleaded
if
we
drive
fast
we
might
still
overtake
him
without
much
hope
they
resumed
the
pursuit
tires
whined
a
protest
as
they
swung
around
sharp
corners
and
the
motor
began
to
heat
this
old
bus
ca
take
it
any
more
jerry
declared
slackening
speed
again
no
sense
in
ruining
the
car
penny
had
been
watching
the
road
carefully
they
had
passed
no
bisecting
highways
so
she
felt
certain
that
the
truck
could
not
have
turned
off
on
either
side
of
the
unpaved
thoroughfare
were
lonely
stretches
of
swamp
and
woods
let
not
turn
back
yet
she
pleaded
we
still
have
a
chance
okay
jerry
consented
but
do
forget
we
have
six
orphans
waiting
for
us
at
the
davis
place
the
car
went
on
for
another
eight
miles
then
came
a
welcome
stretch
of
pavement
we
must
be
getting
near
the
state
line
jerry
remarked
yeah
there
it
is
directly
ahead
was
a
tiny
brick
building
with
an
official
waiting
to
inspect
cars
which
passed
beyond
that
point
a
series
of
markers
warned
the
motorist
to
halt
at
the
designated
place
as
jerry
drew
up
a
man
came
from
the
little
building
carrying
any
shrubs
plants
or
fruit
he
began
but
the
reporter
cut
him
short
we
following
a
stolen
truck
he
exclaimed
has
a
red
truck
loaded
with
cantaloupes
gone
through
here
tonight
i
checked
one
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
fifteen
minutes
jerry
groaned
that
finishes
us
the
trucker
could
have
reached
claymore
by
this
time
the
inspector
responded
once
in
the
city
you
would
have
much
chance
to
pick
him
up
i
have
the
truck
license
number
though
if
you
give
me
all
the
facts
i
make
a
report
to
claymore
police
there
was
no
point
in
pursuing
the
thief
farther
accordingly
penny
and
jerry
provided
the
requested
information
and
then
drove
to
the
davis
farm
regretfully
they
told
davis
of
their
failure
to
trace
the
melon
thief
i
lost
my
crop
the
truck
everything
she
said
in
a
crushed
voice
what
the
use
trying
anyhow
a
body
would
be
smarter
to
go
along
with
than
to
try
to
fight
i
take
it
you
have
a
pretty
fair
idea
who
it
was
that
came
here
tonight
jerry
said
shrewdly
who
are
these
hoods
i
do
dare
tell
you
the
woman
answered
fearfully
you
saw
what
they
did
tonight
they
threw
the
blame
of
the
preston
fire
on
clem
they
do
worse
things
if
i
do
keep
mum
you
want
to
help
your
husband
do
you
penny
inquired
of
course
i
do
but
i
know
better
than
to
talk
you
been
warned
jerry
pursued
the
subject
yes
i
have
now
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
i
told
you
too
much
already
i
just
want
to
know
one
thing
jerry
said
relentlessly
did
your
trouble
start
because
you
and
your
husband
refused
to
join
the
holloway
cooperative
maybe
it
did
the
woman
answered
her
voice
barely
above
a
whisper
i
ai
saying
it
was
apparent
to
jerry
and
penny
that
they
could
expect
no
assistance
from
davis
although
the
events
of
the
night
had
convinced
them
that
clem
davis
was
innocent
others
would
not
share
their
opinion
they
felt
that
by
shielding
the
guilty
parties
davis
was
adopting
a
very
stupid
attitude
come
along
penny
jerry
said
with
a
shrug
let
be
moving
six
reluctant
orphans
were
rounded
up
from
the
hay
loft
where
a
boisterous
game
of
hide
and
seek
was
in
progress
i
can
jam
four
into
my
coupe
if
you
can
handle
the
other
two
in
your
car
jerry
remarked
to
penny
if
they
make
you
any
trouble
just
toot
the
horn
twice
and
i
come
back
and
settle
with
oh
we
get
along
fine
she
smiled
come
along
boys
here
a
souvenir
to
remember
the
night
by
jerry
said
from
the
ground
he
picked
up
two
melons
which
he
handed
to
the
orphans
just
do
sock
the
matron
with
them
when
you
get
back
to
the
home
jerry
let
me
see
one
of
those
melons
penny
exclaimed
suddenly
they
fell
from
the
truck
did
they
i
guess
so
jerry
responded
surprised
by
her
display
of
interest
what
about
i
show
you
turning
on
the
dash
light
of
the
car
penny
held
the
melon
in
its
warm
glow
slowly
she
turned
it
in
her
hands
there
she
said
pointing
to
a
tiny
triangle
shaped
marking
on
the
cantaloupe
this
may
prove
a
clue
which
will
lead
to
the
capture
of
the
thief
i
do
get
it
answered
jerry
what
clue
why
this
stamping
on
the
melon
she
replied
excitedly
the
hoods
must
intend
to
sell
that
load
of
cantaloupes
if
they
do
we
may
be
able
to
trace
the
shipment
chapter
jerry
took
the
melon
from
penny
hand
to
examine
it
this
stamp
may
be
helpful
he
said
dubiously
but
i
doubt
it
the
hoods
never
would
be
so
stupid
as
to
sell
melons
which
could
be
traced
no
i
think
our
investigation
will
have
to
center
close
at
home
you
referring
to
the
holloway
cooperative
jerry
that
outfit
certainly
merits
an
investigation
in
the
morning
i
jog
out
to
their
packing
plant
and
talk
to
the
manager
hank
holloway
what
time
will
you
be
going
jerry
about
nine
probably
perhaps
i
meet
you
there
penny
said
thoughtfully
that
is
if
you
do
mind
glad
to
have
you
the
reporter
responded
in
a
hearty
voice
the
two
cars
soon
started
for
the
riverview
orphans
home
arriving
there
without
mishap
after
unloading
the
boys
entrusted
to
their
care
jerry
and
penny
then
went
to
their
respective
residences
i
glad
you
came
at
last
weems
remarked
as
the
girl
entered
the
house
you
to
telephone
miss
anderson
at
the
riverview
home
but
i
just
left
there
penny
protested
when
did
the
call
come
about
fifteen
minutes
ago
wondering
what
could
be
amiss
penny
went
to
the
telephone
in
a
moment
she
was
in
communication
with
miss
anderson
who
assisted
the
matron
of
the
institution
the
young
woman
voice
betrayed
agitation
as
she
disclosed
that
following
the
night
outing
an
orphan
had
been
discovered
missing
oh
goodness
penny
exclaimed
aghast
one
of
those
six
boys
miss
anderson
reply
slightly
reassured
her
no
the
missing
child
is
a
little
girl
who
was
not
permitted
to
attend
the
party
because
of
a
severe
cold
you
may
remember
her
adelle
indeed
i
do
miss
anderson
tell
me
how
i
may
help
we
already
organized
searching
parties
the
young
woman
returned
adelle
surely
will
be
found
within
a
few
hours
however
if
the
story
gets
out
it
will
do
the
institution
no
good
particularly
at
this
time
when
our
drive
for
funds
is
on
i
see
penny
murmured
you
would
like
the
news
kept
out
of
the
can
it
be
arranged
miss
anderson
asked
eagerly
if
you
will
talk
to
your
father
about
it
we
be
very
grateful
i
ask
him
not
to
print
the
story
penny
promised
none
too
pleased
by
the
request
i
do
hope
adelle
is
found
soon
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
institution
officials
seemed
far
more
worried
about
the
prospect
of
unfavorable
publicity
than
over
the
missing
child
welfare
saying
goodbye
to
miss
anderson
she
sought
her
father
who
was
reading
in
the
library
penny
you
know
i
do
like
to
grant
such
favors
parker
frowned
when
the
conversation
was
repeated
to
him
as
a
matter
of
principle
it
never
pays
to
withhold
information
unless
the
telling
will
harm
innocent
persons
in
this
case
it
will
damage
the
institution
penny
argued
quietly
besides
i
feel
more
or
less
responsible
what
started
out
as
a
nice
little
party
for
the
orphans
ended
in
a
regular
brawl
it
was
planned
primarily
for
adelle
and
then
she
ran
away
because
she
was
permitted
to
attend
starting
at
the
very
beginning
penny
told
her
father
everything
that
had
happened
during
the
night
the
tale
was
one
of
absorbing
interest
to
parker
when
she
had
finished
he
said
do
worry
about
the
affair
penny
i
am
as
interested
in
the
riverview
camp
fund
as
you
are
we
give
the
institution
no
unfavorable
publicity
oh
thanks
dad
she
cried
gratefully
wrapping
her
arms
about
his
neck
you
just
grand
weak
as
water
you
mean
he
corrected
with
a
chuckle
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
know
that
your
friend
blake
has
been
named
to
the
camp
fund
board
no
penny
exclaimed
how
did
that
happen
he
hinted
to
van
cleve
that
he
would
like
to
serve
naturally
after
his
handsome
donation
she
could
refuse
why
do
you
suppose
blake
has
taken
such
a
sudden
interest
in
the
home
i
wonder
myself
i
thought
from
the
first
that
he
up
to
something
so
far
i
not
been
able
to
figure
out
his
little
game
well
you
on
the
board
too
penny
declared
undisturbed
if
he
starts
any
monkey
business
you
can
put
a
quick
stop
to
it
i
fear
you
overestimate
my
talents
parker
responded
however
i
do
intend
to
see
that
blake
does
profit
too
much
by
his
donation
the
hour
was
late
and
penny
soon
went
to
bed
disturbed
by
disappearance
she
did
not
sleep
well
arising
early
she
telephoned
the
orphans
home
hoping
to
learn
that
the
child
had
been
found
no
such
good
news
awaited
her
searchers
have
looked
everywhere
between
here
and
the
davis
farm
miss
anderson
revealed
unless
the
child
is
found
by
noon
it
will
be
necessary
to
broadcast
a
general
alarm
and
that
certain
to
bring
unfavorable
attention
to
the
home
is
there
any
chance
she
could
have
been
kidnaped
penny
asked
thoughtfully
not
the
slightest
was
the
prompt
reply
adelle
took
most
of
her
clothes
with
her
it
a
plain
case
of
a
runaway
but
most
annoying
at
this
time
penny
ate
a
hasty
breakfast
and
then
remembering
her
appointment
with
jerry
drove
to
the
holloway
cooperative
the
buildings
were
of
modern
concrete
construction
located
three
and
a
half
miles
from
riverview
in
the
heart
of
the
truck
farming
district
jerry
livingston
had
not
yet
arrived
so
penny
waited
in
the
car
soon
his
coupe
swung
into
the
drive
and
pulled
up
alongside
leaping
lena
sorry
to
be
late
he
apologized
i
was
held
up
at
the
office
knowing
that
her
father
would
have
told
jerry
about
disappearance
penny
inquired
regarding
the
latest
news
so
far
there
not
a
trace
of
the
child
the
reporter
answered
your
father
sore
at
himself
for
promising
not
to
carry
the
story
it
may
develop
into
something
big
penny
walked
beside
jerry
to
the
entrance
of
the
cooperative
plant
no
one
seems
to
worry
much
about
adelle
she
remarked
the
institution
people
are
afraid
of
unfavorable
publicity
dad
alarmed
about
his
story
while
you
and
i
are
just
plain
indifferent
i
not
indifferent
jerry
denied
in
a
way
i
feel
responsible
for
that
kid
but
what
can
we
do
nothing
i
guess
acknowledged
penny
unwillingly
miss
anderson
said
they
had
enough
searchers
opening
the
door
of
the
building
they
stepped
into
a
huge
room
which
hummed
with
activity
girls
in
uniforms
stood
at
long
tables
inspecting
melons
which
moved
on
an
endless
belt
arrangement
before
them
sorted
as
to
quality
and
size
each
cantaloupe
was
stamped
and
packed
in
a
crate
which
was
then
borne
away
hank
holloway
around
here
jerry
asked
one
of
the
workers
over
there
the
girl
responded
pointing
to
a
burly
man
who
stood
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
jerry
and
penny
approached
the
manager
of
the
cooperative
good
morning
the
man
said
gruffly
gazing
at
them
critically
what
can
i
do
for
you
we
from
the
jerry
informed
do
you
mind
answering
a
few
questions
i
pretty
busy
hank
holloway
responded
frowning
what
do
you
want
to
know
there
a
rumor
going
the
rounds
that
this
cooperative
has
been
forcing
farmers
to
market
their
melons
through
your
organization
it
a
lie
the
manager
retorted
why
they
come
here
begging
us
to
take
their
stuff
we
get
better
prices
than
anyone
in
this
section
of
the
state
and
we
pass
the
profit
right
back
to
the
farmers
how
do
you
account
for
the
depredation
that
been
going
on
around
here
lately
who
would
you
say
is
behind
it
what
mean
depredation
hank
holloway
demanded
the
destruction
of
the
preston
barn
just
as
their
melons
were
ready
for
market
then
last
night
a
truck
of
cantaloupes
was
stolen
from
the
davis
place
that
so
the
manager
asked
had
heard
about
it
clem
davis
always
was
a
worthless
it
would
surprise
me
that
he
covered
his
harvest
with
plenty
of
insurance
and
then
arranged
the
snatch
so
he
could
collect
that
hardly
seems
reasonable
jerry
said
dryly
you
asked
for
my
opinion
and
i
giving
it
to
you
the
davis
melons
were
so
inferior
we
would
handle
them
at
the
cooperative
why
i
thought
their
cantaloupes
were
particularly
fine
ones
penny
protested
i
do
know
what
you
two
are
trying
to
get
at
hank
holloway
said
with
sudden
anger
the
cooperative
does
business
in
a
fair
and
square
way
our
books
are
open
for
inspection
at
any
time
now
you
have
to
excuse
me
for
i
got
work
to
do
with
a
curt
nod
he
turned
away
penny
and
jerry
wandered
about
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
watching
the
packers
they
did
not
much
blame
hank
holloway
for
showing
irritation
their
questions
had
been
very
pointed
and
the
man
had
immediately
guessed
that
their
purpose
was
to
uncover
facts
detrimental
to
the
cooperative
we
learned
about
as
much
as
i
expected
to
jerry
said
with
a
shrug
as
he
and
penny
finally
left
the
building
naturally
one
could
hope
break
down
and
confess
all
what
did
you
really
think
of
him
jerry
hard
to
say
the
reporter
answered
he
a
rough
and
ready
sort
but
that
not
against
him
there
no
real
reason
to
believe
crooked
just
a
hunch
of
mine
having
been
assigned
to
cover
a
board
meeting
jerry
hurriedly
said
goodbye
to
penny
left
to
herself
she
drove
slowly
toward
riverview
since
i
am
so
near
seth
mcguire
place
i
may
as
well
stop
for
a
minute
or
two
she
thought
impulsively
despite
many
exciting
events
penny
had
not
lost
interest
in
the
hubell
clock
although
it
seemed
reasonable
that
a
faulty
mechanism
had
caused
it
to
strike
thirteen
such
an
explanation
did
not
completely
satisfy
her
she
was
eager
to
learn
from
the
former
caretaker
if
the
difficulty
had
been
corrected
leaving
her
car
by
the
main
road
penny
went
directly
to
the
shop
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
however
as
she
turned
away
she
distinctly
heard
a
voice
inside
the
building
although
she
could
not
make
out
the
words
she
was
certain
that
a
child
had
called
who
is
it
she
shouted
help
let
me
out
came
the
plaintive
cry
from
inside
the
shop
penny
ran
to
the
window
and
peered
into
the
dark
interior
she
scarcely
was
able
to
believe
what
she
saw
a
little
girl
her
face
streaked
with
tears
and
dirt
pounded
fiercely
on
the
heavy
door
seeking
release
it
adelle
she
gasped
how
in
the
world
did
she
get
locked
in
mcguire
shop
chapter
extra
with
all
the
windows
and
the
door
of
the
shop
locked
penny
did
not
know
how
to
free
the
imprisoned
child
however
as
she
considered
the
problem
seth
mcguire
appeared
on
the
porch
of
the
cottage
good
morning
he
greeted
her
pleasantly
oh
mr
mcguire
penny
exclaimed
did
you
know
there
is
a
child
locked
inside
your
shop
a
child
the
old
man
exclaimed
coming
quickly
down
the
steps
why
bless
me
how
can
that
be
i
do
understand
how
she
got
inside
but
she
there
officials
of
the
riverview
orphans
home
have
been
searching
for
adelle
hanover
since
last
night
wait
until
i
get
my
key
the
old
man
said
in
an
agitated
voice
i
hope
you
do
think
i
locked
the
child
into
the
shop
knowing
mcguire
as
she
did
penny
entertained
no
such
thought
waving
encouragingly
to
adelle
through
the
window
she
waited
for
the
old
man
to
return
i
locked
the
door
about
eleven
last
night
he
explained
fumbling
nervously
with
the
key
the
little
girl
must
have
stolen
in
there
sometime
between
six
and
that
hour
the
old
man
hand
shook
so
that
he
could
not
unlock
the
door
taking
the
key
penny
did
it
for
him
adelle
her
hair
flying
wildly
about
her
face
stumbled
out
of
the
shop
i
hungry
she
sobbed
it
was
cold
in
there
and
a
big
rat
kept
running
around
why
did
you
lock
me
inside
why
bless
you
mcguire
murmured
i
never
dreamed
anyone
was
inside
the
shop
how
did
you
get
in
there
i
went
inside
last
night
and
hid
adelle
explained
in
a
calmer
voice
it
was
cold
outside
and
i
had
to
have
some
place
to
sleep
you
never
should
have
run
away
from
the
home
penny
reproved
why
did
you
do
it
because
i
do
like
it
there
the
child
answered
defiantly
never
be
adopted
like
the
other
children
why
how
silly
penny
answered
of
course
someone
will
adopt
you
adelle
shook
her
head
miss
anderson
says
i
wo
be
i
heard
her
tell
the
matron
it
on
account
of
a
nervous
i
afraid
of
things
cars
that
very
natural
everything
considered
penny
replied
thinking
of
the
story
miss
anderson
had
told
her
now
i
take
you
to
the
home
adelle
drew
away
and
as
if
seeking
protection
crowded
close
beside
mcguire
i
never
going
back
even
if
i
freeze
and
starve
she
announced
find
me
a
cave
and
live
on
berries
it
would
be
more
fun
than
being
an
orphan
penny
gazed
despairingly
at
the
old
bell
maker
with
a
chuckle
he
took
the
child
by
the
hand
and
led
her
toward
the
cottage
we
have
lunch
and
talk
things
over
he
proposed
how
will
that
be
i
awful
hungry
adelle
admitted
smiling
up
at
him
but
you
give
me
any
old
boiled
potatoes
will
you
we
have
every
single
day
at
the
home
no
potatoes
he
laughed
we
have
the
very
nicest
things
i
can
find
in
the
icebox
and
maybe
a
stick
of
candy
to
top
it
off
while
mcguire
pottered
about
the
kitchen
preparing
a
warm
meal
penny
washed
adelle
and
combed
her
tangled
hair
afterwards
she
telephoned
officials
of
the
home
telling
them
that
the
child
had
been
found
i
bring
her
there
within
an
hour
she
promised
just
as
soon
as
she
has
had
her
lunch
adelle
was
ravenous
she
was
not
a
pretty
child
but
her
face
had
an
elfin
quality
when
she
smiled
her
brown
eyes
roving
about
the
spick
and
span
little
dinette
took
in
every
detail
this
is
almost
as
nice
as
it
was
at
our
home
she
remarked
i
mean
my
real
home
when
daddy
and
mother
were
alive
you
have
a
nice
place
again
when
you
are
adopted
penny
assured
her
kindly
i
like
to
stay
here
adelle
said
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
old
man
would
your
wife
let
me
why
bless
you
i
have
a
wife
he
answered
in
embarrassment
i
a
bachelor
would
you
like
a
little
girl
adelle
persisted
i
could
do
your
dishes
for
you
and
sweep
the
floor
i
be
real
good
well
now
i
often
thought
i
would
like
a
nice
little
girl
he
replied
smiling
then
you
can
have
me
adelle
cried
jumping
up
from
her
chair
you
can
tell
the
home
i
wo
be
back
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
mcguire
said
hastily
i
like
a
little
girl
but
i
am
afraid
i
ca
afford
one
you
see
i
do
make
much
money
any
more
and
there
are
other
reasons
oh
i
wo
eat
much
adelle
promised
please
keep
me
mr
mcguire
the
old
man
was
so
distressed
that
penny
tried
to
come
to
his
rescue
however
despite
repeated
explanations
adelle
refused
to
understand
why
she
could
not
immediately
become
mcguire
little
girl
if
i
had
my
old
job
back
i
be
tempted
sorely
tempted
the
old
man
said
to
penny
i
always
wanted
someone
that
was
near
and
dear
to
me
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
as
things
are
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
worked
out
wo
you
keep
thinking
about
it
adelle
pleaded
anytime
you
want
me
i
come
right
away
yes
i
think
about
it
mcguire
promised
soberly
i
really
will
an
hour
later
penny
took
a
very
depressed
adelle
back
to
the
riverview
orphans
home
leaving
her
there
she
drove
on
into
town
chancing
to
see
her
chum
louise
sidell
on
the
street
signalling
her
with
a
toot
of
the
horn
penny
swung
wide
the
door
on
your
way
home
lou
she
inquired
no
just
wandering
around
in
a
daze
trying
to
do
a
bit
of
shopping
louise
answered
sharing
the
seat
the
stores
here
never
have
anything
i
want
then
why
not
go
to
claymore
penny
proposed
suddenly
i
would
if
i
could
get
there
i
take
you
penny
offered
i
need
to
go
to
claymore
on
special
business
and
i
like
to
have
someone
ride
along
well
i
do
know
louise
replied
dubiously
i
doubt
leaping
lena
would
stand
such
a
long
trip
oh
i
take
the
other
car
in
that
case
the
answer
is
louise
replied
instantly
penny
drove
directly
home
to
exchange
cars
and
tell
weems
where
she
was
going
louise
and
i
may
not
be
back
until
very
late
she
warned
it
barely
possible
we
attend
the
theatre
while
we
at
claymore
there
a
new
play
on
and
everyone
says
it
grand
if
you
drive
after
night
be
very
careful
the
housekeeper
responded
uneasily
there
are
so
many
accidents
these
days
a
brief
stop
was
made
at
the
sidell
residence
and
then
the
girls
took
to
the
road
deliberately
penny
selected
the
same
route
which
she
and
jerry
had
followed
the
previous
night
is
that
why
we
going
to
claymore
louise
inquired
curiously
as
she
heard
the
story
of
what
had
happened
to
the
davis
truck
you
intend
to
trace
those
stolen
melons
i
have
much
hope
of
doing
that
penny
answered
i
want
to
visit
the
telegraph
office
and
get
an
original
message
which
was
sent
to
dad
his
life
has
been
made
miserable
by
a
pest
who
keeps
sending
him
telegrams
and
i
out
to
catch
the
rascal
you
jump
around
from
one
thing
to
another
so
fast
i
ca
keep
track
of
your
enterprises
louise
sighed
i
concentrate
on
the
ones
which
offer
a
prospect
of
ready
cash
penny
rejoined
with
a
laugh
if
i
catch
ben
bowman
it
means
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
to
me
upon
reaching
claymore
the
girls
spent
two
hours
shopping
at
the
large
department
stores
penny
then
made
a
tour
of
the
telegraph
offices
finally
locating
the
one
from
which
mr
bowman
message
had
been
sent
after
explaining
why
she
wished
it
she
was
allowed
to
inspect
and
keep
the
original
copy
which
bore
the
sender
signature
i
turn
this
handwriting
over
to
the
police
she
explained
to
louise
they
may
be
able
to
trace
ben
bowman
by
means
of
it
providing
the
man
ever
comes
to
riverview
louise
said
skeptically
it
seems
like
a
forlorn
hope
to
me
before
leaving
the
office
penny
inquired
of
the
clerk
who
had
handled
the
message
if
a
description
of
ben
bowman
could
be
provided
i
really
do
remember
him
the
young
woman
answered
in
general
i
should
say
he
was
probably
about
years
of
age
not
much
to
go
on
penny
said
regretfully
thanks
anyhow
where
now
louise
asked
in
a
weary
voice
as
they
finally
left
the
telegraph
office
shall
we
buy
tickets
to
the
play
not
yet
said
penny
i
like
to
wander
around
the
market
district
a
bit
for
the
next
hour
they
did
exactly
that
selecting
a
section
of
the
city
where
farmers
brought
their
produce
to
sell
in
open
stalls
penny
went
from
one
counter
to
another
inspecting
cantaloupes
hoping
to
find
one
which
bore
the
davis
stamp
i
getting
tired
of
pawing
vegetables
louise
presently
complained
when
do
we
eat
all
right
we
may
as
well
call
it
a
day
penny
replied
reluctantly
in
the
downtown
section
of
the
city
the
girls
found
a
small
cafe
which
advertised
a
deluxe
dinner
for
one
dollar
treating
themselves
to
the
best
they
enjoyed
a
leisurely
meal
and
then
bought
theatre
tickets
penny
do
you
realize
what
all
this
is
costing
us
louise
began
to
worry
belatedly
oh
i
soon
make
it
up
penny
joked
wait
until
i
capture
ben
bowman
with
my
profit
from
him
we
paint
the
town
red
you
nothing
if
not
optimistic
louise
said
pityingly
the
play
was
an
excellent
one
and
when
the
curtain
fell
at
eleven
neither
girl
begrudged
the
money
paid
for
tickets
it
been
a
grand
day
louise
sighed
contentedly
as
they
left
the
theatre
let
get
home
now
as
quickly
as
we
can
the
drive
to
riverview
consumed
nearly
an
hour
as
the
girls
approached
the
hubell
tower
they
noted
by
the
illuminated
clock
face
that
the
hands
pointed
to
twelve
the
witching
hour
of
midnight
louise
remarked
do
you
still
think
that
mechanical
creature
has
supernatural
powers
quiet
penny
commanded
idling
the
car
as
the
big
clock
began
to
strike
i
going
to
count
the
strokes
i
do
it
too
just
so
you
ca
pull
a
fast
one
on
me
that
two
now
as
each
slow
note
sounded
louise
counted
it
aloud
reaching
twelve
she
paused
but
the
clock
did
not
there
was
a
slight
break
then
another
stroke
why
it
did
strike
thirteen
she
gasped
or
perhaps
i
became
mixed
up
you
made
no
mistake
penny
declared
easing
the
car
to
a
standstill
by
the
curb
it
struck
thirteen
and
that
last
stroke
was
like
the
others
it
did
seem
to
have
a
slightly
different
tone
i
wonder
why
someone
may
have
struck
the
bell
an
extra
tap
penny
answered
with
conviction
louise
do
you
see
it
must
be
a
signal
chapter
the
you
have
the
craziest
ideas
penny
louise
scoffed
i
admit
the
clock
struck
an
extra
time
but
it
must
have
been
because
something
is
wrong
with
the
mechanism
a
signal
my
eye
lowering
the
car
window
penny
peered
curiously
up
at
the
tower
which
was
shrouded
in
fog
and
mist
lou
there
someone
up
there
in
the
cupola
it
may
be
charley
phelps
you
ca
make
a
mystery
out
of
charley
yawned
louise
probably
trying
to
repair
the
clock
come
on
let
get
home
reluctantly
penny
raised
the
window
glass
before
she
could
drive
on
another
car
pulled
up
not
far
from
the
tower
the
driver
a
man
in
an
overcoat
swung
open
the
door
as
if
to
alight
however
observing
car
parked
close
by
he
seemed
to
change
his
mind
keeping
his
head
lowered
so
that
his
face
was
shadowed
he
drove
away
who
was
that
man
penny
demanded
suspiciously
i
afraid
i
neglected
to
inquire
louise
retorted
so
careless
of
me
whoever
he
was
he
intended
to
enter
the
tower
when
he
saw
us
here
he
became
nervous
and
drove
away
oh
penny
you
the
limit
maybe
i
am
but
i
know
what
i
think
the
striking
of
the
clock
was
a
signal
for
some
sort
of
meeting
at
the
tower
a
board
of
directors
confab
perhaps
teased
louise
listen
said
penny
ignoring
the
jibes
i
want
to
park
the
car
on
a
side
street
and
then
come
back
here
afoot
something
is
up
and
i
mean
to
find
out
about
it
oh
penny
louise
sighed
if
i
do
get
home
mother
never
will
allow
me
to
go
anywhere
with
you
again
do
you
realize
what
time
it
is
thirteen
penny
chuckled
it
may
never
be
that
again
so
i
must
strike
while
the
clock
strikes
so
to
speak
how
about
it
well
it
your
car
louise
replied
with
a
shrug
i
powerless
in
your
hands
penny
drove
around
a
block
parking
on
a
street
she
and
louise
then
approached
the
tower
afoot
not
wishing
to
be
seen
they
took
care
to
keep
close
to
a
high
hedge
which
edged
the
grounds
i
never
felt
more
silly
in
my
life
louise
complained
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
now
windows
were
made
to
look
through
penny
responded
coolly
let
see
what
charley
phelps
is
doing
inside
the
tower
circling
the
building
the
girls
placed
a
rock
beneath
one
of
the
rear
windows
from
that
unstable
perch
penny
was
able
to
peer
into
the
living
quarters
of
the
tower
well
what
do
you
see
sherlock
louise
demanded
impatiently
nothing
how
perfectly
amazing
louise
taunted
mischievously
what
do
you
make
of
it
charley
phelps
seems
to
be
reading
a
newspaper
baffling
it
must
have
some
deep
dark
significance
with
a
sigh
penny
stepped
down
from
the
rock
want
to
look
she
invited
i
do
not
then
i
guess
we
may
as
well
go
home
penny
said
reluctantly
as
she
spoke
both
girls
heard
an
automobile
pull
up
in
front
of
the
tower
with
reviving
hope
penny
placed
a
restraining
hand
on
arm
forcing
her
to
wait
in
the
shadow
of
the
building
a
minute
elapsed
and
then
the
front
door
of
the
tower
slammed
shut
without
the
slightest
hesitation
penny
once
more
moved
to
her
previous
position
beneath
the
window
charley
has
some
visitors
she
reported
in
a
whisper
four
men
i
never
saw
before
i
wish
i
could
hear
what
they
are
saying
why
not
smash
the
window
or
saw
a
hole
through
the
wall
louise
proposed
sarcastically
penny
stepped
from
the
rock
offering
the
place
to
her
chum
do
look
inside
she
urged
maybe
you
recognize
those
men
really
important
louise
unwillingly
did
as
requested
but
after
a
moment
moved
away
from
the
window
i
never
saw
any
of
them
either
she
said
they
must
be
friends
of
charley
phelps
it
a
special
meeting
penny
insisted
i
suspect
other
men
may
come
along
within
a
few
minutes
i
know
one
thing
louise
announced
flatly
i
not
be
here
to
see
them
if
you
not
ready
to
go
home
then
i
shall
walk
oh
all
right
i
go
penny
grumbled
it
seems
a
pity
though
just
when
we
might
have
learned
something
important
taking
care
to
remove
the
stone
from
beneath
the
tower
window
she
hastened
after
her
chum
in
silence
they
drove
to
the
sidell
home
where
louise
alighted
sorry
to
have
spoiled
your
fun
penny
she
apologized
as
she
said
goodnight
if
you
only
arrange
to
conduct
your
explorations
by
daylight
i
try
to
cooperate
arriving
at
her
own
home
a
few
minutes
later
penny
found
her
father
waiting
up
for
her
parker
had
attended
a
meeting
of
the
camp
fund
board
and
upon
returning
at
had
been
disturbed
to
find
his
daughter
absent
hold
it
hold
it
penny
greeted
him
before
he
could
speak
i
know
late
but
i
can
explain
everything
you
always
able
to
explain
too
well
the
editor
responded
dryly
weems
expected
that
you
would
be
home
not
later
than
eleven
well
one
thing
just
seemed
to
lead
to
another
dad
louise
and
i
saw
a
wonderful
show
i
obtained
a
copy
of
ben
bowman
signature
and
then
to
top
it
off
the
hubell
clock
struck
thirteen
again
which
in
your
estimation
explains
everything
i
wish
it
did
penny
said
neatly
changing
the
subject
dad
louise
and
i
saw
a
number
of
men
going
into
the
tower
tonight
obviously
they
were
summoned
there
by
the
striking
of
the
clock
tommyrot
oh
dad
you
have
a
scrap
of
imagination
penny
sighed
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
charley
phelps
may
be
connected
with
the
hoods
never
replied
parker
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
around
making
such
wild
suggestions
you
find
yourself
involved
in
serious
trouble
you
the
only
one
to
whom
i
confided
my
theory
dad
in
fact
it
only
this
minute
occurred
to
me
so
i
thought
penny
if
i
were
you
i
would
forget
the
hubell
clock
why
not
devote
yourself
to
something
worthwhile
for
instance
i
provide
an
interesting
job
i
been
asked
to
select
play
equipment
for
the
new
orphans
camp
i
be
happy
to
turn
the
task
over
to
you
do
you
think
i
could
do
it
penny
asked
dubiously
why
not
you
can
learn
from
the
matron
of
the
home
what
is
needed
and
then
make
your
selection
i
be
glad
to
do
it
dad
when
is
the
camp
to
open
the
actual
date
has
been
set
but
it
will
be
soon
that
is
unless
a
serious
disagreement
arises
about
the
camp
site
a
disagreement
penny
inquired
curiously
yes
blake
is
trying
to
influence
the
board
to
buy
a
track
of
land
which
he
controls
at
a
very
high
price
the
price
seems
to
be
fair
enough
i
personally
do
care
for
the
site
however
it
located
on
the
river
but
too
close
to
the
swamp
then
why
does
the
board
consider
it
blake
gave
a
very
generous
donation
you
remember
i
figured
at
the
time
he
would
expect
something
in
return
he
profit
by
the
sale
obviously
i
do
know
who
owns
the
land
but
blake
will
receive
a
commission
on
the
sale
the
board
also
is
considering
a
wooded
property
closer
to
riverview
and
i
favor
that
site
will
the
board
listen
to
you
dad
i
rather
doubt
it
my
objections
were
especially
vigorous
either
property
will
be
satisfactory
and
blake
price
is
a
trifle
more
attractive
with
a
yawn
parker
arose
and
locked
the
front
door
it
after
one
he
said
let
get
to
bed
penny
started
up
the
stairway
only
to
pause
as
the
telephone
rang
while
her
father
answered
it
she
waited
curiously
to
learn
who
would
be
calling
at
such
a
late
hour
in
a
moment
he
replaced
the
receiver
on
its
hook
that
was
the
night
editor
of
the
he
explained
briefly
has
a
big
story
broken
dad
another
storage
barn
was
burned
to
the
ground
about
ten
minutes
ago
the
night
editor
called
to
ask
how
i
wanted
the
story
handled
then
the
depredation
was
done
by
the
hoods
it
looks
that
way
penny
came
slowly
down
the
stairway
to
face
her
father
dad
if
the
fire
was
set
only
a
few
minutes
ago
does
that
support
my
theory
which
theory
you
have
so
many
i
mean
about
the
hubell
tower
penny
said
soberly
the
clock
struck
thirteen
on
the
night
the
preston
barn
was
destroyed
do
you
see
dad
the
hoods
hold
their
meetings
and
then
ride
forth
to
accomplish
their
underhanded
work
chapter
ben
penny
let
postpone
this
animated
discussion
until
morning
parker
said
wearily
reaching
to
switch
out
the
bridge
lamp
then
you
do
agree
with
me
that
the
caretaker
of
the
tower
may
have
some
connection
with
the
hoods
dad
she
asked
in
an
injured
tone
i
certainly
do
not
he
answered
firmly
now
if
you
excuse
me
going
to
bed
decidedly
crestfallen
penny
followed
her
father
upstairs
for
several
minutes
she
stood
by
the
window
of
her
room
gazing
toward
the
hubell
tower
whose
lights
could
be
dimly
seen
across
the
city
then
with
a
shrug
she
too
dismissed
the
subject
from
her
mind
and
gave
herself
to
slumber
parker
had
gone
to
the
office
by
the
time
penny
arose
the
next
morning
finding
a
discarded
newspaper
by
his
plate
she
eagerly
scanned
it
for
an
account
of
the
midnight
fire
to
her
disappointment
only
a
brief
item
appeared
on
the
front
page
the
story
merely
said
that
the
barn
of
john
hancock
truck
farmer
had
been
destroyed
by
a
blaze
of
unknown
origin
in
the
right
hand
column
was
another
news
item
to
the
effect
that
sheriff
daniels
had
made
no
progress
in
tracing
the
missing
clem
davis
tossing
aside
the
paper
penny
helped
with
the
breakfast
dishes
as
gently
as
possible
she
broke
the
news
to
weems
that
she
might
make
another
trip
to
claymore
why
bother
to
remain
home
even
for
meals
the
housekeeper
said
severely
i
declare
i
do
know
what
your
father
is
thinking
about
to
allow
you
such
liberties
when
i
was
a
girl
it
was
considered
very
daring
to
go
for
a
buggy
ride
without
a
chaperon
penny
completed
mischievously
now
i
very
sorry
about
last
night
louise
and
i
did
intend
to
remain
out
so
late
it
was
after
one
when
you
came
in
weems
replied
her
voice
stern
you
know
i
do
approve
of
such
hours
for
a
girl
of
your
age
i
promise
it
wo
happen
again
please
let
me
go
to
claymore
though
i
expected
to
buy
playground
equipment
for
the
riverview
orphans
new
camp
exerting
all
her
charm
penny
explained
the
necessity
for
the
trip
finally
convincing
weems
that
the
excuse
had
not
been
thought
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
was
granted
the
requested
permission
penny
next
move
was
to
induce
louise
sidell
to
accompany
her
on
the
excursion
both
girls
laid
siege
to
sidell
who
somewhat
dubiously
said
that
her
daughter
might
go
providing
she
would
be
home
by
nightfall
recalling
her
father
instructions
penny
called
at
the
riverview
orphans
home
to
talk
with
the
matron
there
she
obtained
a
list
of
playground
equipment
to
be
purchased
with
suggested
prices
for
each
item
as
the
girls
were
leaving
the
institution
they
met
miss
anderson
and
paused
to
inquire
about
adelle
the
child
seems
to
be
nervous
and
unhappy
the
young
woman
told
them
especially
so
since
she
ran
away
we
sincerely
hope
she
will
presently
become
adjusted
penny
asked
if
there
was
any
prospect
the
little
girl
would
be
adopted
not
very
soon
miss
anderson
answered
regretfully
in
fact
her
name
is
not
on
the
list
of
eligibles
we
never
allow
a
child
to
leave
the
home
until
we
feel
that
he
or
she
is
capable
of
adapting
himself
to
new
conditions
the
drive
to
claymore
was
an
enjoyable
one
and
by
eleven
the
girls
had
purchased
many
of
the
items
on
their
list
to
the
amusement
of
the
department
store
salesman
they
insisted
upon
testing
swings
and
even
the
slides
all
this
equipment
is
for
the
riverview
orphans
home
not
for
ourselves
penny
explained
the
committee
will
pay
for
it
very
well
we
send
the
merchandise
just
as
soon
as
a
cheque
is
received
the
salesman
promised
giving
her
an
itemized
bill
feeling
very
well
satisfied
with
their
purchases
penny
and
louise
wandered
into
another
department
of
the
store
the
delightful
aroma
of
food
drew
them
to
a
lunch
counter
and
from
there
they
went
to
the
main
floor
the
store
was
very
crowded
as
penny
was
inspecting
a
pair
of
gloves
on
a
counter
a
man
pushed
past
her
and
ran
toward
the
nearest
exit
in
surprise
she
turned
around
unintentionally
blocking
the
way
of
a
store
detective
shoving
past
her
he
pursued
the
first
man
only
to
lose
him
in
the
milling
crowd
near
the
front
door
that
fellow
must
have
been
a
shoplifter
penny
remarked
to
louise
i
think
he
got
away
too
the
unexpected
commotion
had
drawn
the
interest
of
many
shoppers
mingling
with
the
crowd
the
girls
heard
a
woman
tell
a
companion
that
the
man
who
had
escaped
was
wanted
for
attempting
to
pass
a
forged
cheque
a
moment
later
the
store
detective
came
striding
down
the
aisle
pausing
at
the
jewelry
counter
he
spoke
to
the
floorman
confirming
the
report
well
the
fellow
escaped
he
tried
to
pass
a
bum
cheque
for
fifty
dollars
what
name
did
he
use
the
floorman
inquired
ben
bowman
it
will
be
something
else
next
time
penny
had
heard
the
words
startled
by
the
name
she
moved
hastily
to
the
detective
side
excuse
me
she
addressed
him
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
ben
bowman
forged
a
cheque
that
correct
miss
the
detective
answered
staring
at
her
curiously
know
anything
about
the
man
i
think
i
may
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
see
the
cheque
the
detective
removed
it
from
a
vest
pocket
offering
the
signature
for
inspection
one
glance
satisfied
penny
that
the
cheque
had
been
signed
by
the
same
man
who
had
been
sending
her
father
crank
messages
at
home
i
have
a
telegram
which
i
sure
bears
this
identical
signature
she
revealed
i
never
seen
the
man
though
except
as
he
ran
through
the
store
the
store
detective
questioned
penny
at
length
about
her
knowledge
of
bowman
realizing
that
a
description
of
the
man
might
be
of
great
value
to
her
he
showed
her
a
small
card
which
bore
a
mounted
photograph
this
is
ben
bowman
he
assured
her
he
an
expert
forger
and
uses
any
number
of
names
think
you
can
remember
the
face
i
try
to
penny
replied
he
does
seem
to
have
any
distinguishing
features
though
his
angular
jaw
is
rather
noticeable
the
detective
pointed
out
brown
eyes
are
set
fairly
close
together
he
about
six
feet
two
and
dresses
well
penny
was
highly
elated
to
have
gained
a
description
of
bowman
and
especially
pleased
that
the
man
had
been
traced
to
claymore
the
fact
that
he
was
a
known
forger
encouraged
her
to
hope
that
police
soon
would
apprehend
him
that
one
hundred
dollars
dad
offered
for
bowman
capture
is
as
good
as
mine
already
she
boasted
gleefully
to
louise
as
they
left
the
store
all
i
need
to
do
is
wait
no
doubt
you
collect
louise
admitted
grudgingly
i
never
met
anyone
with
your
brand
of
luck
i
feel
especially
lucky
today
too
penny
said
with
a
gay
laugh
tell
you
what
let
make
another
tour
of
the
vegetable
markets
it
will
make
us
late
in
getting
home
the
time
is
sure
to
be
wasted
too
oh
come
along
penny
urged
seizing
her
by
the
arm
i
promise
to
have
you
in
riverview
no
later
than
three
in
driving
into
claymore
that
morning
the
girls
had
noticed
a
large
outdoor
market
near
the
outskirts
of
the
city
returning
to
it
penny
parked
the
car
and
with
her
chum
wandered
about
the
sales
area
a
nice
fat
chicken
a
farm
woman
asked
persuasively
holding
up
an
uninviting
specimen
fresh
eggs
we
looking
for
melons
penny
replied
breldway
has
some
nice
cantaloupes
the
woman
returned
he
got
a
truck
load
of
in
from
riverview
just
the
other
day
locating
breldway
place
of
business
louise
and
penny
began
to
inspect
the
melons
offered
for
sale
almost
at
once
they
came
upon
a
basket
of
cantaloupes
which
bore
a
blurred
stamp
louise
these
look
like
the
davis
crop
penny
cried
excitedly
would
you
say
someone
deliberately
had
blocked
out
the
old
marking
it
does
appear
that
way
maybe
we
can
find
just
one
melon
with
the
original
stamp
penny
dug
into
the
basket
with
both
hands
tossing
up
cantaloupes
for
louise
to
place
on
the
ground
their
activities
immediately
drew
the
attention
and
displeasure
of
breldway
if
you
looking
for
a
good
melon
let
me
help
you
he
said
hurrying
toward
them
penny
straightened
holding
up
a
cantaloupe
for
him
to
see
i
do
need
any
help
she
said
distinctly
i
found
the
melon
i
want
it
bears
the
davis
stamp
chapter
familiar
the
melon
you
have
selected
is
a
very
good
one
the
market
man
declared
not
understanding
the
significance
of
penny
remark
shall
i
put
it
in
a
sack
for
you
i
not
interested
in
the
melon
only
in
the
stamp
penny
replied
do
you
realize
that
you
may
be
liable
to
arrest
what
mean
liable
to
arrest
the
man
demanded
i
an
honest
dealer
and
i
have
a
license
look
at
these
melons
penny
held
up
one
which
bore
the
blurred
stamp
the
trade
name
has
been
altered
the
dealer
took
the
cantaloupe
from
her
examining
it
briefly
she
then
offered
him
the
single
melon
bearing
the
davis
stamp
well
what
about
it
he
asked
just
this
a
few
nights
ago
a
truck
load
of
melons
similar
to
these
was
stolen
from
the
davis
farm
near
riverview
the
thief
was
trailed
right
to
this
city
you
trying
to
say
that
i
sell
stolen
melons
i
not
making
any
direct
accusations
penny
replied
evenly
no
doubt
you
can
explain
where
you
got
the
melons
certainly
i
can
i
bought
a
truck
load
of
them
from
a
farmer
named
john
toby
the
melons
were
good
the
price
cheap
and
i
did
pay
any
attention
to
the
stamp
is
toby
a
regular
dealer
i
buy
from
him
now
and
then
when
his
prices
are
right
i
never
bothered
to
ask
any
questions
where
does
the
man
live
i
ca
tell
you
that
he
a
large
fellow
with
brown
hair
and
eyes
the
description
was
too
meagre
to
be
of
value
to
penny
does
toby
drive
a
red
truck
she
inquired
thoughtfully
he
did
this
last
time
it
was
a
red
truck
which
was
stolen
from
the
davis
farm
penny
said
quietly
i
sure
these
melons
came
from
there
too
i
paid
good
money
for
them
the
dealer
retorted
in
a
defiant
tone
so
far
as
i
knew
they
belonged
to
this
fellow
toby
i
ca
investigate
every
farmer
who
offers
me
produce
all
the
same
you
could
get
into
serious
trouble
for
selling
stolen
melons
penny
replied
of
course
i
have
no
intention
of
going
to
the
police
providing
you
are
willing
to
cooperate
what
mean
cooperate
the
dealer
inquired
suspiciously
only
this
will
you
see
john
toby
again
that
hard
to
tell
he
said
he
might
bring
in
another
load
of
melons
within
the
next
few
days
when
you
receive
the
next
shipment
will
you
notify
me
yes
i
willing
to
do
that
the
dealer
promised
if
toby
is
crooked
i
want
to
know
it
myself
penny
gave
the
man
her
name
address
and
telephone
number
knowing
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
reach
her
quickly
enough
she
instructed
him
to
detain
the
farmer
by
force
if
necessary
if
i
ca
get
in
touch
with
you
i
may
have
the
fellow
questioned
by
police
the
dealer
offered
i
do
want
to
put
myself
into
a
hole
penny
was
not
entirely
satisfied
that
the
market
man
would
keep
his
promise
however
she
hesitated
to
make
a
report
to
the
police
without
first
consulting
her
father
everything
considered
it
seemed
best
to
let
the
situation
work
out
as
it
would
well
your
luck
is
still
running
true
to
form
louise
said
jokingly
as
the
girls
drove
toward
riverview
do
you
have
any
idea
who
john
toby
may
be
not
the
slightest
penny
confessed
the
description
would
fit
hank
holloway
or
for
that
matter
any
one
of
a
dozen
men
i
know
the
girls
arrived
in
riverview
by
after
an
uneventful
trip
penny
dropped
louise
at
the
sidell
home
and
then
went
to
the
office
to
talk
with
her
father
parker
was
absent
from
his
desk
but
his
secretary
who
was
typing
letters
explained
that
he
would
return
in
a
moment
penny
sat
down
in
her
father
chair
to
wait
a
bulky
unsealed
envelope
lay
on
the
desk
peering
at
it
curiously
she
noted
that
it
bore
the
marking
property
deed
lots
and
what
this
she
asked
aloud
is
dad
buying
property
oh
no
the
secretary
replied
glancing
up
from
her
typewriter
that
is
the
deed
and
abstract
for
the
orphans
camp
site
i
wonder
which
property
it
is
the
land
blake
controls
i
believe
at
least
he
brought
the
papers
into
the
office
this
morning
for
your
father
inspection
i
heard
him
say
that
if
the
forms
are
satisfactory
the
deal
will
be
completed
at
once
penny
unfolded
one
of
the
lengthy
documents
shaking
her
head
as
she
scanned
the
legal
terms
i
do
see
how
dad
makes
anything
of
this
she
said
such
a
mess
of
words
and
names
i
imagine
parker
intends
to
turn
it
over
to
his
lawyer
the
secretary
smiled
the
editor
entered
the
office
at
that
moment
and
penny
directed
her
next
question
to
him
dad
is
it
all
settled
that
the
camp
board
will
purchase
land
practically
so
he
answered
if
my
lawyer
adams
approves
the
abstract
the
deal
will
be
completed
against
my
advice
van
cleve
already
has
given
blake
five
hundred
dollars
to
hold
an
option
why
did
she
do
that
dad
well
blake
convinced
her
he
had
another
buyer
for
the
property
the
old
story
competition
stimulates
interest
do
the
papers
seem
to
be
all
right
oh
i
not
looked
at
them
parker
replied
blake
is
a
good
real
estate
man
though
so
there
not
likely
to
be
any
flaw
who
actually
owns
the
property
dad
it
there
on
the
abstract
he
answered
why
not
look
it
up
for
yourself
too
much
like
doing
penny
grinned
but
she
spread
the
document
on
the
desk
and
began
to
read
various
names
aloud
and
harry
clark
to
lydia
goldwein
lydia
goldwein
to
benjamin
bowman
what
was
that
name
parker
demanded
sharply
benjamin
bowman
penny
peered
at
the
document
a
second
time
to
make
certain
she
had
made
no
mistake
that
the
truth
dad
who
knows
maybe
it
your
old
pal
ben
are
you
making
up
that
name
parker
asked
skeptically
penny
thrust
the
abstract
into
his
hand
here
read
it
for
yourself
dad
bowman
seems
to
be
the
present
owner
of
the
land
parker
rapidly
scanned
the
document
the
land
is
held
by
a
benjamin
bowman
he
admitted
frowning
a
strange
coincidence
i
never
heard
of
a
bowman
family
living
near
riverview
penny
remarked
reaching
for
a
telephone
book
did
you
no
but
bowman
is
a
fairly
common
name
turning
to
the
b
section
penny
went
through
the
telephone
list
there
only
one
bowman
here
she
said
penciling
a
circle
around
the
name
a
maud
bowman
the
name
maud
bowman
does
appear
on
the
abstract
parker
declared
as
he
studied
the
document
once
more
there
something
funny
about
this
blake
seemed
rather
eager
to
dispose
of
the
land
did
he
his
price
was
a
bit
low
which
surprised
me
parker
said
thinking
aloud
probably
everything
can
be
explained
satisfactorily
then
why
not
ask
blake
to
do
it
penny
proposed
he
should
be
able
to
tell
you
something
about
his
client
that
really
a
idea
parker
agreed
and
he
reached
for
a
telephone
i
ask
blake
to
come
here
at
once
chapter
blake
suave
completely
at
ease
sat
opposite
parker
and
penny
in
the
editor
private
office
i
came
as
soon
as
i
could
after
receiving
your
telephone
message
parker
he
said
pleasantly
now
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
perhaps
i
should
have
bothered
you
the
editor
apologized
however
in
glancing
over
the
abstract
for
the
orphans
camp
property
i
noticed
that
the
land
is
owned
by
a
man
named
benjamin
bowman
quite
true
i
am
acting
as
his
agent
it
happens
that
i
have
had
dealings
with
a
man
by
that
same
name
resumed
parker
rather
unpleasant
dealings
i
might
add
i
curious
to
learn
if
this
property
owner
is
the
same
fellow
very
unlikely
i
think
blake
shrugged
my
client
does
not
reside
in
riverview
nor
does
the
man
i
have
in
mind
can
you
tell
us
what
he
looks
like
penny
interposed
eagerly
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
ca
blake
returned
i
never
met
mr
bowman
yet
you
act
as
his
agent
parker
inquired
in
astonishment
all
our
dealings
have
been
by
mail
or
telephone
i
see
the
editor
commented
reflectively
well
at
least
you
can
provide
me
with
the
man
address
i
ca
do
that
either
blake
declined
benjamin
bowman
is
a
salesman
with
no
permanent
address
he
communicates
with
me
at
fairly
regular
intervals
but
until
i
hear
from
him
i
have
no
idea
where
he
will
be
the
following
week
your
description
seems
to
fit
the
man
of
my
acquaintance
parker
said
dryly
but
tell
me
how
do
you
expect
to
complete
this
deal
will
bowman
come
here
to
sign
the
necessary
papers
oh
that
wo
be
required
he
already
made
out
the
sales
documents
and
also
given
me
a
power
of
attorney
mr
bowman
seems
to
think
of
everything
parker
remarked
grimly
i
was
hoping
for
the
pleasure
of
meeting
him
i
really
do
see
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
the
sale
of
the
property
blake
reproved
in
a
mild
voice
you
feel
that
the
site
is
a
suitable
one
and
the
price
right
i
have
no
serious
objections
to
it
then
why
allow
your
personal
feelings
to
interfere
with
the
deal
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
parker
answered
then
if
you
give
your
approval
we
sign
the
final
papers
tomorrow
at
my
office
the
dedication
of
the
new
camp
has
been
set
for
the
tenth
of
the
month
and
that
means
no
time
can
be
lost
everything
seems
to
have
been
settled
without
my
approval
parker
said
smiling
however
if
you
do
mind
i
keep
this
abstract
a
little
longer
as
you
like
the
real
estate
man
shrugged
have
your
lawyer
go
over
the
records
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
he
find
no
flaws
anywhere
arising
blake
bowed
politely
and
left
the
office
penny
waited
until
she
knew
that
he
was
a
considerable
distance
from
the
door
before
seeking
her
father
opinion
of
the
interview
everything
may
be
on
the
level
he
conceded
frowning
i
no
reason
to
distrust
blake
and
yet
i
ca
help
feeling
that
there
something
peculiar
about
this
land
deal
blake
has
been
rushing
things
through
at
such
a
furious
rate
penny
nodded
another
thing
ben
bowman
is
a
forger
what
makes
you
think
that
the
editor
asked
alertly
any
real
information
penny
revealed
everything
she
had
learned
that
day
at
claymore
parker
listened
attentively
making
few
comments
until
she
had
finished
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
there
is
something
phoney
about
connection
with
this
affair
he
declared
grimly
we
see
what
my
lawyer
has
to
say
having
made
up
his
mind
that
the
transaction
merited
a
thorough
investigation
parker
personally
carried
the
questionable
abstract
to
a
reliable
law
firm
adams
and
mcpherson
the
report
came
back
late
in
the
afternoon
and
was
relayed
to
penny
at
the
dinner
table
adams
says
that
the
abstract
seems
to
be
drawn
up
correctly
the
editor
disclosed
he
could
find
no
flaw
in
it
or
in
any
of
the
records
at
the
court
house
then
apparently
we
jumped
too
hasty
to
conclusions
penny
remarked
in
disappointment
i
not
so
sure
adams
tells
me
that
the
ownership
of
the
property
is
a
very
muddled
affair
muddled
yes
it
has
changed
hands
many
times
in
the
past
year
and
oddly
none
of
the
buyers
or
sellers
seem
to
be
known
in
riverview
what
does
adams
think
about
that
dad
he
advises
that
the
records
be
inspected
very
carefully
it
will
take
weeks
though
for
they
are
quite
involved
i
suppose
that
will
hold
up
the
opening
of
the
camp
it
may
parker
acknowledged
however
it
seems
wise
to
take
every
precaution
even
if
the
camp
is
opened
this
year
too
much
money
is
involved
to
risk
paying
for
land
which
may
have
a
faulty
title
the
following
day
the
editor
conferred
with
members
of
the
camp
fund
board
telling
of
his
findings
to
his
chagrin
van
cleve
did
not
share
his
views
i
trust
blake
judgment
implicitly
she
insisted
i
am
sure
the
property
will
be
satisfactory
in
every
way
if
there
should
by
chance
be
any
flaw
in
the
title
he
would
make
it
good
we
ca
possibly
delay
the
dedication
another
week
added
another
feminine
member
of
the
board
the
summer
is
nearly
over
now
at
least
postpone
making
the
final
payment
until
after
i
have
had
another
report
from
my
lawyers
parker
pleaded
very
well
we
do
that
van
cleve
agreed
blake
is
so
obliging
i
am
sure
he
will
allow
us
to
set
up
equipment
on
the
land
even
though
we
do
actually
possess
title
the
entire
transaction
seemed
very
unbusinesslike
to
parker
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
force
his
opinion
upon
the
board
members
accordingly
plans
went
forward
for
the
grand
opening
of
the
camp
stories
appeared
regularly
in
the
playground
equipment
and
floored
tents
were
set
up
on
the
camp
site
and
the
actual
dedication
program
was
announced
you
might
know
blake
would
be
invited
to
make
the
main
speech
penny
remarked
disapprovingly
as
she
scanned
the
latest
story
of
the
coming
affair
every
day
in
every
way
he
gives
me
a
bigger
and
bigger
pain
throughout
the
week
both
she
and
louise
had
been
very
active
helping
out
at
the
new
camp
site
the
land
had
been
cleared
of
underbrush
trails
had
been
constructed
and
a
well
dug
while
supervising
the
of
slides
and
penny
upon
several
occasions
had
had
disagreements
with
blake
the
man
remained
at
the
site
almost
constantly
imposing
his
wishes
upon
everyone
a
great
deal
of
time
and
money
has
been
spent
getting
that
place
ready
for
the
dedication
penny
commented
to
her
father
if
anything
should
happen
that
the
final
papers
are
signed
it
would
be
a
pity
i
had
no
report
as
yet
parker
answered
my
lawyers
tell
me
they
never
delved
into
a
more
involved
case
what
does
blake
think
about
the
investigation
he
seems
to
be
agreeable
however
i
suspect
he
been
working
on
the
various
board
members
trying
to
get
them
to
conclude
the
deal
without
waiting
how
long
will
it
be
before
you
have
a
final
report
dad
i
do
know
he
admitted
i
expected
to
get
it
long
before
this
in
the
flurry
of
preparing
for
the
camp
dedication
penny
had
no
opportunity
to
give
much
thought
to
other
affairs
she
did
not
see
seth
mcguire
the
sheriff
had
nothing
to
disclose
concerning
clem
disappearance
and
the
black
hoods
seemed
to
have
become
an
extinct
organization
on
the
morning
of
the
designated
date
penny
was
abroad
early
she
and
louise
planned
to
drive
to
the
dedication
exercises
together
and
wished
to
arrive
before
the
grounds
were
congested
eating
breakfast
hurriedly
penny
scarcely
noticed
when
her
father
was
called
to
the
telephone
he
absented
himself
from
the
dining
room
nearly
fifteen
minutes
as
he
returned
to
the
table
penny
pushed
back
her
chair
ready
to
leave
well
i
see
you
at
the
camp
grounds
dad
she
said
lightly
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
the
dedication
responded
parker
in
a
sober
tone
by
rights
there
should
be
none
penny
stared
at
him
i
just
heard
from
my
lawyers
parker
explained
then
there
is
a
flaw
in
the
title
as
you
suspected
decidedly
it
a
very
mess
and
as
yet
we
not
sure
what
it
may
mean
tell
me
about
it
dad
penny
pleaded
sliding
back
into
her
chair
benjamin
bowman
whoever
he
may
be
does
own
the
camp
property
then
in
whose
name
is
it
the
property
does
belong
to
anyone
why
how
ridiculous
penny
exclaimed
does
every
piece
of
land
in
the
world
belong
to
someone
actually
the
heirs
of
rosanna
and
joseph
schulta
own
this
particular
property
but
there
are
no
heirs
what
you
say
does
make
sense
to
me
dad
the
whole
affair
is
very
involved
parker
explained
in
tracing
back
the
history
of
the
land
my
lawyers
found
that
originally
it
was
owned
by
rosanna
and
joseph
schulta
an
elderly
couple
who
had
no
known
relatives
they
sailed
for
germany
more
than
fifty
years
ago
the
ship
sank
and
presumably
they
were
lost
their
land
was
never
claimed
and
somehow
the
state
overlooked
the
case
but
i
thought
the
property
had
changed
hands
many
times
in
recent
years
only
theoretically
all
those
records
have
been
falsified
by
whom
dad
ben
bowman
my
lawyers
are
inclined
to
think
blake
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
is
a
very
shrewd
real
estate
man
and
in
examining
records
at
the
court
house
he
may
have
learned
about
this
floating
property
then
he
deliberately
tried
to
cheat
the
camp
fund
board
it
looks
that
way
neither
ben
bowman
nor
anyone
else
owns
the
property
had
you
not
noticed
his
name
on
the
abstract
it
unlikely
the
fraud
would
have
been
uncovered
for
quite
a
few
years
to
come
what
will
you
do
dad
penny
inquired
deeply
distressed
the
dedication
is
scheduled
to
start
within
an
hour
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
postponed
parker
said
soberly
it
will
have
to
go
on
according
to
schedule
afterwards
you
ask
for
blake
arrest
there
no
real
evidence
against
him
no
evidence
he
claims
to
be
a
mere
agent
of
ben
bowman
all
of
the
deeds
and
legal
papers
were
drawn
up
by
some
other
person
if
any
accusation
is
made
against
him
he
can
escape
by
maintaining
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
back
records
there
one
person
who
might
be
able
to
implicate
him
penny
exclaimed
ben
bowman
bowman
should
have
it
in
his
power
to
clear
up
some
of
the
mystery
parker
agreed
but
how
are
we
to
find
him
i
do
know
penny
admitted
it
looks
rather
hopeless
unless
the
police
just
present
him
to
us
wrapped
in
pink
ribbon
the
clock
struck
nine
daring
not
to
linger
any
longer
penny
hastily
bade
her
father
goodbye
and
left
the
house
driving
to
the
camp
site
with
louise
sidell
she
told
her
chum
of
the
latest
complications
blake
is
one
of
the
worst
hypocrites
in
the
world
she
declared
feelingly
he
pretends
he
wants
to
help
the
orphans
and
all
the
while
he
intends
to
trick
the
board
and
make
a
nice
profit
for
himself
your
father
wo
let
him
get
away
with
it
louise
returned
confidently
so
long
as
the
money
has
been
paid
over
there
no
need
to
worry
arriving
at
the
camp
site
the
girls
went
at
once
to
the
official
tent
to
their
surprise
blake
van
cleve
and
all
members
of
the
board
save
parker
were
there
on
the
table
lay
various
legal
papers
which
bore
signatures
still
moist
with
ink
penny
gazed
from
one
person
to
another
slowly
comprehending
the
scene
you
not
buying
this
property
she
exclaimed
in
protest
van
cleve
reply
stunned
her
it
seemed
unreasonable
to
keep
blake
waiting
the
woman
said
quietly
the
transaction
has
just
been
completed
chapter
oh
van
cleve
you
been
cheated
the
signing
of
the
papers
had
taken
penny
so
by
surprise
that
she
did
not
weigh
her
words
before
speaking
too
late
she
realized
that
her
father
never
would
approve
of
revealing
the
facts
in
such
blunt
fashion
however
having
said
so
much
she
was
determined
to
go
on
my
dear
what
do
you
mean
inquired
van
cleve
troubled
by
the
unexpected
accusation
any
money
paid
for
this
land
will
be
lost
my
father
has
just
learned
i
resent
such
loose
talk
blake
broke
in
irritably
mr
bowman
whom
i
represent
has
taken
a
substantial
loss
on
the
property
and
who
is
ben
bowman
penny
challenged
you
ca
produce
him
nor
prove
that
he
owns
the
land
the
title
is
faulty
neither
you
nor
ben
bowman
has
any
right
to
sell
it
this
is
true
van
cleve
asked
the
real
estate
man
certainly
not
you
may
be
sure
that
if
there
is
the
slightest
flaw
in
the
title
i
shall
return
your
cheque
perhaps
considering
the
uncertainty
it
might
be
wise
to
postpone
payment
until
i
have
talked
again
with
parker
van
cleve
said
diffidently
the
real
estate
man
made
no
attempt
to
hide
his
annoyance
my
dear
van
cleve
he
said
the
deal
already
has
been
completed
i
have
tried
to
remain
patient
but
really
this
is
too
much
on
the
table
lay
several
typewritten
papers
clipped
neatly
to
the
uppermost
one
was
the
cheque
endorsed
by
van
cleve
blake
reached
to
take
possession
of
it
but
his
move
was
deliberate
acting
impulsively
penny
darted
forward
and
seized
the
bit
of
paper
to
the
horror
of
everyone
in
the
tent
she
tore
the
cheque
into
a
dozen
pieces
and
tossed
them
into
the
air
there
she
announced
a
trifle
stunned
by
her
own
act
penelope
you
should
have
done
that
van
cleve
reproved
but
she
smiled
faintly
you
are
an
outrageous
child
blake
exclaimed
losing
his
temper
what
do
you
expect
to
accomplish
by
such
a
stupid
trick
van
cleve
will
merely
write
out
another
cheque
well
under
the
circumstance
it
might
be
better
to
wait
the
club
woman
demurred
i
really
should
have
acted
without
consulting
mr
parker
unless
the
transaction
is
completed
now
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
dedication
blake
declared
i
shall
decline
to
make
my
speech
penny
broad
grin
made
it
clear
that
she
thought
the
loss
would
not
be
a
great
one
furthermore
i
shall
ask
that
my
recent
donation
be
returned
blake
resumed
severely
i
shall
withdraw
this
property
for
sale
will
withdraw
it
penny
caught
him
up
i
thought
you
merely
were
acting
as
the
agent
for
benjamin
bowman
i
mean
i
shall
make
such
a
suggestion
to
him
the
real
estate
man
amended
penny
waited
anxiously
for
van
cleve
decision
to
her
relief
the
society
woman
seemed
annoyed
by
the
attitude
blake
had
taken
i
am
sorry
she
said
coldly
if
you
do
wish
to
make
the
dedication
speech
we
will
manage
to
do
without
your
services
as
for
the
cheque
i
can
not
make
out
another
until
i
have
discussed
the
situation
with
mr
parker
the
argument
went
on
but
penny
did
not
remain
to
hear
it
louise
took
her
forcibly
by
the
arm
fairly
pulling
her
outside
the
tent
have
you
caused
enough
trouble
she
demanded
disapprovingly
such
a
mess
as
everything
is
in
now
i
do
care
penny
replied
i
saved
the
camp
fund
money
van
cleve
was
glad
i
tore
up
the
cheque
too
she
just
did
dare
say
so
there
will
be
no
dedication
what
will
everyone
think
disconsolately
louise
gazed
toward
the
area
which
had
been
roped
off
for
cars
although
it
was
half
an
hour
before
the
formal
program
was
to
start
hundreds
of
persons
had
arrived
on
a
platform
built
especially
for
the
occasion
an
orchestra
played
spritely
selections
there
were
picnic
tables
and
a
stone
fireplace
for
outdoor
cooking
as
the
girls
wandered
slowly
toward
the
river
a
bus
loaded
with
orphans
arrived
from
the
riverview
home
with
shrieks
of
laughter
the
children
swarmed
over
the
grounds
taking
possession
of
swings
sand
pile
and
slides
it
seems
a
pity
louise
remarked
again
by
ten
the
grounds
were
jammed
with
visitors
penny
knew
that
her
father
must
have
arrived
for
the
exercises
but
although
she
searched
everywhere
she
could
not
find
him
in
roving
about
she
did
meet
blake
who
pretended
not
to
see
her
how
matters
had
been
arranged
the
girls
did
not
know
however
promptly
at
the
dedication
exercises
began
exactly
as
scheduled
blake
occupied
the
platform
with
other
members
of
the
board
and
at
the
proper
time
made
a
brief
and
rather
curt
speech
everything
seems
to
have
turned
out
rather
well
louise
remarked
in
relief
blake
may
not
be
such
a
bad
sort
after
all
do
you
believe
it
penny
returned
he
just
clever
enough
never
to
put
himself
in
a
bad
light
if
he
can
help
it
i
only
hope
van
cleve
did
give
in
to
him
and
sign
another
cheque
following
the
dedication
exercises
a
portion
of
the
crowd
dispersed
but
many
persons
remained
to
enjoy
picnic
lunches
penny
and
louise
ate
their
own
sandwiches
and
then
watched
the
orphans
at
play
the
new
camp
director
seems
very
efficient
louise
remarked
her
gaze
upon
a
young
man
who
supervised
the
children
presently
as
the
girls
watched
the
camp
supervisor
announced
that
he
would
take
several
boys
and
girls
for
a
sail
on
the
river
the
boat
a
dinghy
had
been
the
gift
of
a
riverview
department
store
owner
immediately
there
was
a
great
clamor
from
the
children
for
everyone
wanted
to
take
the
first
ride
only
six
may
go
the
director
said
and
called
off
the
names
penny
and
louise
wandered
down
to
the
water
edge
to
watch
the
loading
of
the
boat
adelle
had
been
one
of
the
orphans
chosen
and
they
waved
reassuringly
to
her
the
camp
director
shoved
off
and
quickly
raised
the
sail
there
were
squeals
of
delight
from
the
children
as
it
filled
causing
the
craft
to
heel
over
slightly
the
breeze
is
quite
uncertain
today
penny
remarked
anxiously
i
hope
that
young
man
knows
what
he
is
about
the
boat
sailed
a
diagonal
course
across
the
river
turned
and
came
back
on
another
tack
then
as
the
breeze
died
it
seemed
to
make
no
progress
at
all
losing
interest
penny
and
louise
started
to
walk
on
down
the
shore
scarcely
had
they
turned
away
than
they
were
startled
to
hear
screams
from
the
river
whirling
around
they
saw
that
the
camp
director
was
in
serious
trouble
a
sudden
puff
of
wind
had
caught
the
boat
when
it
did
not
have
steerage
way
unable
to
drive
ahead
it
slowly
tilted
sideways
it
going
over
louise
screamed
already
penny
had
kicked
off
her
shoes
without
waiting
for
the
inevitable
result
she
plunged
into
the
river
when
her
head
emerged
from
the
water
she
saw
the
boat
on
its
side
two
children
were
clinging
to
it
the
camp
director
was
frantically
trying
to
support
two
others
while
another
girl
and
boy
struggled
wildly
to
keep
from
sinking
swimming
as
rapidly
as
she
could
penny
reached
the
overturned
boat
her
first
act
was
to
help
the
camp
director
who
was
being
strangled
by
the
two
children
who
clung
to
him
drawing
the
trio
to
the
craft
she
then
seized
a
struggling
boy
by
the
hair
and
pulled
him
to
safety
adelle
the
camp
director
gasped
get
her
the
little
girl
had
been
carried
a
considerable
distance
from
the
boat
penny
started
to
swim
toward
her
but
she
saw
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
from
the
forest
close
by
had
emerged
an
unshaven
man
in
rough
soiled
clothing
diving
into
the
water
he
seized
adelle
and
swam
with
her
to
shore
penny
did
not
return
to
the
overturned
boat
for
several
men
had
waded
out
to
tow
it
to
land
concerned
regarding
adelle
she
followed
the
rescuer
the
man
bore
the
orphan
in
his
arms
to
a
grassy
spot
on
shore
stretching
her
out
there
he
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
before
the
crowd
could
surround
him
darted
quickly
away
toward
the
woods
wait
penny
shouted
wading
through
the
shallow
water
the
man
heard
but
paid
no
heed
he
entered
the
forest
and
was
lost
to
view
that
was
clem
davis
penny
thought
tensely
i
sure
of
it
before
she
could
reach
adelle
other
persons
had
gathered
around
the
child
clyde
blake
pushed
through
the
crowd
what
is
this
he
inquired
what
has
happened
as
the
man
bent
over
adelle
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
gazing
directly
into
his
face
for
a
moment
she
stared
at
him
in
a
bewildered
way
then
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
she
pointed
an
accusing
finger
you
are
the
one
she
whispered
shakily
you
the
man
whose
car
killed
my
mother
and
daddy
chapter
a
adelle
accusation
brought
a
murmur
of
consternation
and
shocked
surprise
from
the
crowd
blake
however
seemed
undisturbed
dropping
on
his
knees
he
supported
adelle
and
wrapped
his
coat
about
her
trembling
shoulders
there
there
my
poor
child
he
said
soothingly
you
are
quite
upset
and
for
good
reason
do
touch
me
adelle
shivered
cringing
away
you
mean
and
cruel
by
this
time
miss
anderson
and
other
officials
of
the
riverview
home
had
reached
the
scene
somewhat
sternly
they
tried
to
silence
the
child
she
does
know
what
she
is
saying
miss
anderson
apologized
to
blake
adelle
has
been
very
nervous
since
she
was
in
an
automobile
accident
i
quite
understand
the
real
estate
man
responded
the
child
must
have
a
change
of
clothing
and
no
doubt
medical
care
may
i
send
her
to
the
home
in
my
car
why
that
is
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
miss
anderson
said
gratefully
with
every
appearance
of
concern
blake
picked
adelle
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
away
penny
was
kept
busy
helping
bundle
up
the
other
children
who
had
been
rescued
from
the
water
none
the
worse
for
the
misadventure
they
too
were
taken
to
blake
car
here
put
on
my
coat
before
you
freeze
louise
said
anxiously
to
penny
after
the
automobile
had
sped
away
we
must
start
home
at
once
i
do
want
to
go
now
penny
protested
did
you
notice
that
man
who
pulled
adelle
from
the
water
he
looked
like
a
tramp
i
wonder
what
made
him
run
away
lou
i
think
that
man
was
clem
davis
by
rights
i
should
tell
the
sheriff
but
i
ca
bring
myself
to
do
it
not
after
the
way
he
saved
adelle
never
mind
all
that
now
louise
said
forcing
penny
toward
the
car
you
must
go
home
and
change
your
wet
clothes
but
i
want
to
find
clem
davis
and
talk
with
him
that
will
have
to
wait
you
going
home
taking
her
chum
firmly
by
the
arm
louise
pushed
her
into
the
car
at
the
parker
home
penny
changed
her
clothes
discussing
the
events
as
she
dried
her
hair
adelle
accusation
had
not
escaped
her
and
she
had
taken
it
more
seriously
than
did
others
in
the
crowd
perhaps
that
child
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
she
declared
to
louise
blake
car
may
have
been
the
one
which
killed
her
parents
oh
penny
you
so
hopelessly
prejudiced
against
the
man
her
chum
replied
maybe
i
am
but
adelle
is
the
only
person
who
can
identify
the
motorist
even
so
you
know
she
probably
is
not
a
reliable
witness
i
grant
that
her
accident
today
may
have
upset
her
emotionally
penny
conceded
after
she
recovers
i
curious
to
learn
what
have
to
say
the
hour
was
so
late
that
the
girls
did
not
return
to
the
camp
site
louise
soon
went
to
her
own
home
and
penny
was
left
alone
she
restlessly
wandered
about
polished
the
car
and
fretted
because
neither
her
father
nor
weems
came
home
at
length
for
want
of
another
occupation
she
motored
to
the
riverview
home
on
the
pretext
of
inquiring
about
the
condition
of
the
children
rescued
from
the
water
they
doing
just
fine
miss
anderson
assured
her
that
is
all
except
adelle
the
child
is
very
upset
has
she
said
anything
more
about
mr
blake
penny
inquired
she
does
know
his
name
but
she
keeps
insisting
he
was
the
man
whose
car
killed
her
parents
i
never
was
so
mortified
in
my
life
as
when
she
made
the
accusation
fortunately
blake
did
not
take
offense
penny
was
eager
to
talk
with
adelle
and
miss
anderson
said
that
she
might
do
so
for
a
few
minutes
the
little
girl
had
been
put
to
bed
but
seemed
quite
content
as
she
played
with
a
new
doll
mcguire
sent
me
this
she
said
holding
it
up
for
penny
to
see
i
named
her
imogene
miss
anderson
was
called
to
the
telephone
during
the
young
absence
penny
discreetly
questioned
adelle
about
the
motor
accident
in
which
her
parents
had
lost
their
lives
she
was
worried
lest
the
child
be
upset
again
but
to
her
relief
adelle
answered
in
a
tone
no
one
will
believe
me
the
little
girl
said
just
the
same
that
man
i
saw
today
was
the
one
who
ran
into
my
daddy
car
he
had
a
big
gray
automobile
with
a
horn
on
it
that
played
a
tune
a
gray
car
penny
repeated
thoughtfully
i
quite
sure
sedan
is
dark
blue
why
you
were
taken
home
in
his
automobile
this
afternoon
adelle
it
was
that
car
the
child
answered
he
must
have
another
one
miss
anderson
the
room
so
penny
did
not
ask
additional
questions
soon
leaving
the
home
she
motored
slowly
toward
the
camp
site
by
the
river
although
she
readily
understood
that
adelle
might
be
mistaken
a
conviction
was
growing
upon
her
that
clyde
blake
could
have
been
the
driver
even
if
he
does
drive
a
gray
car
that
proves
nothing
she
mused
he
easily
could
have
changed
it
during
the
past
year
penny
thought
that
she
might
find
her
father
or
some
of
the
camp
board
officials
still
at
the
river
however
as
she
drove
into
the
parking
area
she
observed
that
the
grounds
were
entirely
deserted
paper
plates
napkins
and
newspapers
had
been
blown
by
the
wind
picnic
tables
still
held
the
unsightly
remains
of
lunches
the
platform
had
been
torn
down
even
the
tents
were
gone
for
it
was
not
planned
to
make
practical
use
of
the
grounds
until
more
work
had
been
done
as
penny
was
starting
to
drive
away
she
noticed
a
lone
man
near
one
of
the
picnic
tables
he
was
dressed
in
rough
unpressed
garments
and
seemed
to
be
scavenging
food
which
had
been
left
behind
that
the
same
man
who
pulled
adelle
from
the
water
she
thought
alertly
leaping
from
the
car
penny
ran
toward
him
hearing
footsteps
the
man
turned
and
saw
her
almost
in
panic
he
started
for
the
woods
wait
penny
shouted
i
wo
turn
you
over
to
the
police
please
wait
the
man
hesitated
and
then
apparently
deciding
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
a
girl
paused
i
want
to
thank
you
for
saving
adelle
penny
said
breathlessly
why
did
you
run
away
well
i
do
know
the
man
answered
avoiding
her
gaze
i
never
liked
crowds
penny
decided
to
risk
a
direct
accusation
you
are
clem
davis
she
said
eyeing
him
steadily
that
a
laugh
the
man
retorted
starting
to
edge
away
my
name
is
thomas
ryan
now
please
do
run
away
again
penny
pleaded
sensing
his
intention
if
you
are
clem
davis
and
i
sure
you
are
i
want
to
help
you
how
could
you
help
me
by
exposing
the
men
who
framed
you
i
never
believed
that
you
set
fire
to
the
preston
barn
i
never
did
please
tell
me
about
it
penny
urged
seating
herself
at
one
of
the
picnic
benches
who
are
you
anyhow
the
man
asked
suspiciously
why
are
you
so
willing
to
help
me
as
you
say
i
penelope
parker
and
my
father
publishes
the
oh
i
see
you
after
a
story
no
that
part
is
only
incidental
penny
said
hurriedly
what
my
father
really
wants
to
do
is
to
expose
the
black
hoods
and
drive
them
out
of
existence
you
the
one
person
who
might
be
able
to
provide
evidence
which
would
convict
the
guilty
parties
i
could
tell
plenty
if
i
was
a
mind
to
do
it
no
one
would
believe
me
though
i
will
mr
davis
i
was
in
the
notion
of
going
to
the
grand
jury
at
one
time
the
man
said
slowly
that
what
brought
on
all
my
trouble
if
i
had
sense
enough
to
have
kept
my
mouth
shut
i
would
be
a
fugitive
now
what
connection
did
you
have
with
the
hoods
were
you
a
member
of
the
organization
yes
i
was
the
man
admitted
reluctantly
i
did
know
much
about
the
hoods
when
i
joined
then
i
tried
to
drop
out
and
that
what
turned
against
me
suppose
you
tell
me
all
about
it
what
is
the
real
purpose
of
the
organization
well
right
now
the
hoods
are
trying
to
force
every
truck
farmer
in
this
district
to
join
the
county
cooperative
then
hank
holloway
must
be
the
ring
leader
penny
exclaimed
startled
by
the
information
no
he
not
at
the
head
of
the
hoods
clem
davis
corrected
who
is
the
man
penny
questioned
eagerly
clem
davis
started
to
speak
then
hesitated
an
automobile
had
driven
into
the
parking
area
only
a
few
rods
away
several
workmen
who
had
been
assigned
to
clean
up
the
grounds
alighted
they
coming
this
way
clem
davis
said
uneasily
i
ca
risk
being
seen
abruptly
he
started
toward
the
sheltering
trees
wait
penny
pleaded
pursuing
him
you
have
told
me
half
enough
please
wait
i
not
going
to
risk
arrest
the
man
returned
over
his
shoulder
at
least
meet
me
here
again
okay
i
do
that
clem
davis
agreed
tomorrow
night
just
at
dusk
penny
said
quickly
and
please
do
fail
me
i
promise
i
help
you
chapter
davis
after
clem
davis
had
disappeared
into
the
woods
penny
wasted
no
more
time
in
the
vicinity
jumping
into
her
car
she
drove
home
in
a
daze
of
excitement
to
tell
her
father
the
amazing
story
meeting
that
man
was
wonderful
luck
she
assured
him
exultantly
why
if
only
he
reveals
what
he
knows
we
will
get
an
exclusive
story
for
the
we
expose
the
hoods
and
put
an
end
to
the
organization
as
easy
as
that
laughed
parker
seriously
though
i
think
we
are
on
the
verge
of
cracking
the
story
in
going
over
the
books
of
the
county
cooperative
jerry
has
discovered
any
number
of
discrepancies
i
always
thought
that
hank
holloway
might
be
connected
with
the
hoods
dad
i
believe
he
was
the
night
rider
who
made
off
with
davis
melons
any
idea
who
the
other
members
of
the
outfit
may
be
not
yet
but
i
expect
to
find
out
when
i
meet
clem
davis
tomorrow
i
go
with
you
parker
declared
maybe
i
should
take
sheriff
daniels
along
too
oh
dad
penny
protested
indignantly
i
promised
to
help
clem
not
turn
him
over
to
an
officer
i
am
afraid
that
unless
i
go
alone
not
even
show
himself
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
go
by
yourself
the
editor
admitted
learn
what
you
can
from
davis
and
make
an
appointment
for
him
to
see
me
another
matter
weighed
heavily
on
penny
mind
in
her
encounter
with
clyde
blake
that
morning
she
had
acted
in
a
manner
and
sooner
or
later
her
father
must
hear
about
the
cheque
episode
dad
i
have
a
confession
to
make
she
began
awkwardly
when
i
reached
the
camp
this
morning
i
found
that
blake
had
induced
the
board
members
to
buy
the
property
never
mind
parker
interrupted
i
already
heard
the
details
of
your
disgraceful
actions
from
van
cleve
i
thoroughly
ashamed
of
myself
penny
said
contritely
i
tore
up
the
cheque
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
was
a
foolish
rather
dramatic
thing
to
do
however
i
must
acknowledge
the
result
was
highly
pleasing
to
everyone
save
clyde
blake
what
does
he
have
to
say
dad
he
claims
that
he
acted
in
good
faith
for
benjamin
bowman
likewise
that
he
had
no
suspicion
the
title
was
faulty
naturally
he
would
take
such
an
attitude
i
asked
blake
to
produce
ben
bowman
parker
resumed
unless
he
can
do
so
and
prove
that
the
property
actually
is
owned
by
him
the
deal
is
off
do
you
think
blake
will
bring
the
man
to
riverview
i
doubt
it
very
much
the
editor
answered
i
suspect
he
bluff
and
finally
let
the
deal
go
by
default
it
will
be
an
easy
way
out
for
him
blake
always
seems
to
escape
his
misdeeds
i
wish
we
could
find
ben
bowman
ourselves
and
bring
the
two
men
together
that
would
be
interesting
finding
ben
bowman
would
serve
many
useful
purposes
parker
said
grimly
but
now
that
i
would
actually
welcome
a
communication
from
him
he
no
longer
pesters
me
eagerly
penny
awaited
the
hour
appointed
for
her
meeting
with
clem
davis
knowing
that
the
man
did
not
obtain
enough
to
eat
she
spent
considerable
time
the
next
afternoon
preparing
a
lunch
basket
of
substantial
food
taking
it
with
her
she
waited
at
the
camp
site
for
nearly
a
half
hour
finally
just
as
she
began
to
think
that
the
man
had
failed
her
he
appeared
i
brought
you
some
hot
coffee
penny
said
taking
the
plug
from
a
thermos
bottle
a
little
food
too
say
that
swell
the
man
murmured
gratefully
my
wife
slips
me
a
handout
whenever
she
can
but
lately
the
house
has
been
watched
so
closely
she
ca
get
away
seating
himself
at
the
picnic
table
clem
davis
drained
the
cup
of
coffee
in
a
few
swallows
and
greedily
devoured
a
sandwich
now
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
gruffly
parker
had
told
penny
exactly
what
questions
to
ask
she
began
with
the
most
important
one
davis
tell
me
who
is
the
head
man
of
the
hoods
i
do
know
myself
he
answered
promptly
at
the
meetings
the
master
always
wore
a
robe
and
a
black
hood
none
of
the
members
ever
were
permitted
to
see
his
face
you
have
no
idea
who
the
man
may
be
clem
davis
shook
his
head
as
he
bit
into
another
sandwich
i
doubt
there
are
more
than
one
or
two
members
of
the
order
who
know
his
identity
hank
holloway
might
or
maybe
charley
phelps
is
phelps
a
member
penny
asked
quickly
one
of
the
chief
ones
most
of
the
meetings
are
held
at
his
place
you
do
mean
at
the
hubell
tower
penny
pulse
had
stepped
up
to
a
faster
pace
for
the
information
was
of
the
greatest
value
furthermore
it
thrilled
her
that
her
own
theory
regarding
charley
phelps
was
receiving
support
sure
the
hoods
meet
at
the
tower
about
once
a
month
clem
davis
disclosed
usually
they
get
together
on
the
thirteenth
but
sometimes
they
have
extra
sessions
when
special
meetings
are
held
a
green
light
burns
on
the
tower
or
the
clock
strikes
thirteen
times
just
at
midnight
i
thought
so
penny
exclaimed
highly
elated
tell
me
why
did
you
decide
to
break
your
connection
with
the
hoods
i
joined
the
organization
before
i
knew
what
i
was
letting
myself
in
for
when
they
made
plans
to
burn
the
preston
barn
i
wanted
to
quit
the
hoods
threatened
me
and
to
get
even
planted
evidence
that
made
it
look
as
if
i
had
set
the
fire
penny
was
inclined
to
believe
that
clem
davis
had
told
a
straight
story
for
it
coincided
with
her
own
theories
always
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
evidence
pointing
to
his
guilt
had
been
entirely
too
plain
to
corroborate
her
conclusions
she
had
brought
from
home
the
watch
fob
found
at
the
davis
stable
hoping
that
he
might
identify
it
that
not
mine
he
said
promptly
when
she
showed
the
article
to
him
i
never
saw
it
before
penny
opened
the
tiny
case
displaying
the
child
picture
however
the
man
had
no
idea
who
the
little
boy
might
be
davis
she
said
quietly
replacing
the
watch
fob
in
her
pocket
i
believe
in
your
innocence
and
i
want
to
help
you
i
am
sure
i
can
providing
you
are
willing
to
cooperate
i
already
told
you
about
everything
i
know
you
given
me
splendid
information
penny
praised
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
talk
with
my
father
he
probably
ask
you
to
repeat
your
story
to
the
grand
jury
i
be
a
fool
to
do
that
clem
davis
responded
i
ca
prove
any
of
my
statements
the
preston
fire
would
be
pinned
on
me
and
the
hoods
might
try
to
harm
my
wife
why
they
ran
off
with
a
truck
load
of
our
melons
the
other
night
i
know
but
unless
someone
has
the
courage
to
speak
out
against
the
hoods
they
become
bolder
and
do
even
more
harm
supposing
you
were
promised
absolute
protection
then
would
you
go
before
the
grand
jury
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
but
who
can
guarantee
i
not
be
made
to
pay
i
think
my
father
can
penny
assured
him
will
you
meet
him
here
tomorrow
night
at
this
same
hour
okay
the
man
agreed
getting
up
from
the
table
you
seem
to
be
on
the
level
i
bring
more
food
tomorrow
penny
said
as
an
extra
inducement
you
must
have
had
a
hard
time
since
you
been
hiding
out
in
the
woods
oh
it
not
so
bad
once
you
get
used
to
it
the
man
shrugged
got
a
pretty
good
place
to
sleep
now
inside
a
building
penny
asked
curiously
an
automobile
the
man
grinned
someone
abandoned
it
in
the
swamp
and
i
taken
possession
an
old
one
i
suppose
not
so
old
clem
davis
answered
funny
thing
it
a
deluxe
model
with
good
upholstery
the
only
thing
i
can
see
wrong
with
it
is
that
the
front
grill
and
fenders
have
been
smashed
the
car
is
by
chance
a
gray
one
yes
it
is
the
man
admitted
how
did
you
guess
i
did
guess
penny
returned
soberly
i
have
a
suspicion
that
car
is
the
one
which
killed
two
people
about
a
year
ago
davis
you
must
take
me
to
it
at
once
chapter
broken
you
want
me
to
take
you
to
the
abandoned
car
now
clem
davis
echoed
in
surprise
it
located
deep
in
the
swamp
just
off
a
side
road
would
it
require
long
to
get
there
penny
asked
thoughtfully
a
half
hour
at
least
with
night
coming
on
you
would
be
able
to
see
a
thing
it
is
getting
dark
penny
admitted
regretfully
everything
considered
i
guess
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
tomorrow
but
in
the
meantime
i
wish
you
would
search
the
car
carefully
get
the
engine
number
anything
which
might
help
to
identify
the
owner
the
engine
number
has
been
filed
off
clem
answered
i
give
the
car
a
good
going
over
though
to
see
what
i
can
learn
thanks
for
the
food
raising
his
hand
in
a
semi
salute
the
man
started
into
the
woods
do
forget
to
meet
dad
and
me
tomorrow
night
penny
called
after
him
we
be
waiting
here
about
this
same
time
the
interview
with
the
fugitive
had
more
than
fulfilled
expectations
driving
straight
home
she
made
a
full
report
of
the
talk
to
her
father
breathlessly
she
revealed
that
the
hoods
held
monthly
meetings
at
the
hubell
tower
and
that
both
hank
holloway
and
charley
phelps
were
members
of
the
order
you
were
able
to
learn
the
name
of
the
head
man
parker
questioned
no
clem
did
know
it
himself
he
says
the
master
never
shows
himself
to
anyone
but
always
appears
in
mask
parker
began
to
pace
the
floor
a
habit
of
his
when
under
mental
stress
the
information
penny
had
acquired
was
of
utmost
importance
he
believed
it
to
be
authentic
but
he
dared
not
overlook
the
possibility
that
clem
davis
had
deliberately
lied
we
must
move
cautiously
on
this
story
he
said
aloud
should
we
make
false
accusations
against
innocent
persons
the
would
face
disastrous
lawsuits
you
not
going
to
withhold
the
information
from
the
public
penny
demanded
in
disappointment
for
the
present
i
must
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
try
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
head
man
any
news
published
in
the
would
only
serve
as
a
to
him
you
right
of
course
penny
agreed
after
a
moment
of
silence
now
that
we
have
such
a
splendid
start
it
should
be
easy
to
gain
additional
information
the
editor
resumed
you
say
the
meetings
usually
are
held
on
the
thirteenth
of
the
month
that
what
clem
davis
told
me
then
we
arrange
to
have
the
tower
watched
on
that
night
in
the
meantime
i
see
davis
and
learn
what
i
can
from
him
jerry
is
working
on
the
county
cooperative
angle
of
the
story
and
should
have
some
interesting
facts
soon
penny
knew
that
her
father
was
adopting
a
wise
policy
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
slightly
disappointed
always
eager
for
action
she
had
hoped
that
clem
davis
disclosures
would
lead
to
the
immediate
arrest
of
both
hank
holloway
and
charley
phelps
however
she
brightened
at
the
thought
that
at
least
additional
revelations
might
follow
her
meeting
with
the
fugitive
the
following
night
shortly
after
penny
and
parker
presented
themselves
at
the
orphans
camp
site
they
had
brought
a
basket
of
food
coffee
and
a
generous
supply
of
cigarettes
what
time
did
davis
promise
to
meet
you
parker
asked
impatiently
he
should
be
here
now
penny
returned
i
ca
imagine
why
he
late
another
half
hour
elapsed
and
still
the
fugitive
did
not
appear
parker
paced
restlessly
beside
the
picnic
table
becoming
increasingly
impatient
he
probably
waiting
until
after
dark
penny
declared
optimistically
another
hour
elapsed
the
shadows
deepened
and
a
chill
wind
blew
from
the
river
hungry
mosquitoes
kept
parker
more
than
occupied
as
he
sought
to
protect
himself
well
i
had
enough
of
this
he
announced
at
last
the
man
coming
oh
dad
let
wait
just
a
little
longer
penny
coaxed
i
sure
he
meant
to
keep
his
promise
perhaps
he
did
although
i
inclined
to
think
otherwise
at
any
rate
i
am
going
home
penny
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
her
father
to
the
car
she
could
not
understand
clem
davis
failure
to
appear
unless
he
had
feared
that
he
would
be
placed
under
arrest
while
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
man
might
come
to
the
picnic
grounds
the
following
night
she
was
afraid
she
would
never
see
him
again
i
half
expected
this
to
happen
parker
remarked
as
he
drove
toward
riverview
unless
we
can
get
davis
to
swear
to
his
story
we
have
a
scrap
of
real
evidence
against
the
hoods
we
may
learn
something
on
the
night
of
the
thirteenth
penny
said
hopefully
possibly
but
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
everything
davis
told
you
may
not
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
deception
he
seemed
sincere
i
ca
believe
he
deliberately
lied
to
me
submerged
in
gloom
penny
had
little
to
say
during
the
swift
ride
into
riverview
she
could
not
blame
her
father
for
feeling
annoyed
because
the
trip
had
cost
him
two
hours
of
valuable
time
clem
davis
failure
to
appear
undoubtedly
might
deprive
the
of
a
spectacular
scoop
never
mind
parker
said
to
comfort
her
it
was
your
fault
we
find
another
way
to
get
our
information
the
car
proceeded
slowly
through
the
downtown
section
of
riverview
turning
her
head
to
read
an
electric
sign
penny
attention
was
drawn
to
a
man
in
a
gray
suit
who
was
walking
close
to
the
curb
dad
stop
the
car
she
cried
seizing
his
arm
there
he
is
now
clem
davis
parker
demanded
swerving
the
automobile
toward
a
vacant
space
near
the
sidewalk
no
no
ben
bowman
i
sure
it
is
he
springing
from
the
car
penny
glanced
up
the
street
she
had
alighted
just
in
time
to
see
the
man
in
gray
enter
a
telegraph
office
what
nonsense
is
this
parker
inquired
impatiently
why
do
you
think
the
fellow
is
bowman
i
sure
he
the
same
man
i
saw
at
claymore
the
one
who
tried
to
pass
a
forged
cheque
oh
please
dad
we
ca
let
him
get
away
switching
off
the
car
ignition
parker
stepped
to
the
curb
if
it
should
prove
to
be
ben
bowman
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
nab
him
he
announced
grimly
but
if
you
made
a
mistake
come
on
penny
urged
seizing
his
hand
we
can
talk
about
it
later
through
the
huge
plate
glass
window
of
the
telegraph
office
the
man
in
gray
could
be
seen
standing
at
one
of
the
counters
his
back
was
to
the
street
and
he
appeared
to
be
writing
a
message
i
sure
it
ben
bowman
penny
said
again
why
not
go
inside
and
ask
him
if
that
his
name
i
shall
but
i
warning
you
again
if
you
made
one
of
your
little
mistakes
go
ahead
faint
heart
penny
chuckled
giving
him
a
tiny
push
stay
here
by
the
door
ready
to
stop
him
if
he
gets
by
you
with
no
appearance
of
haste
parker
sauntered
into
the
telegraph
office
deliberately
taking
a
place
at
the
counter
close
beside
the
man
in
gray
he
pretended
to
write
a
message
actually
he
studied
his
companion
and
attempted
to
read
the
lengthy
telegram
which
the
other
had
composed
before
he
could
do
so
the
man
handed
the
paper
to
a
girl
clerk
get
this
off
right
away
he
instructed
send
it
collect
the
clerk
examined
the
message
having
difficulty
in
reading
the
writing
this
night
letter
is
to
be
sent
to
anthony
parker
she
inquired
that
right
the
man
agreed
parker
waited
for
no
more
touching
the
man
on
the
arm
he
said
distinctly
i
save
you
the
trouble
of
sending
that
message
i
am
anthony
parker
the
man
whirled
around
his
face
plainly
showing
consternation
you
are
ben
bowman
i
assume
parker
said
coolly
i
long
looked
forward
to
meeting
you
you
got
me
mixed
up
with
someone
else
the
man
mumbled
edging
away
my
name
clark
edgewater
see
i
signed
it
to
this
telegram
as
proof
of
his
contention
he
pointed
to
the
lengthy
communication
which
lay
on
the
counter
one
glance
satisfied
parker
that
it
was
another
crank
message
i
do
care
how
you
sign
your
name
he
retorted
you
are
ben
bowman
we
have
a
few
matters
to
talk
over
the
man
gazed
uncertainly
at
parker
he
started
to
speak
then
changed
his
mind
turning
he
made
a
sudden
break
for
the
exit
stop
him
parker
shouted
do
let
him
get
away
penny
stood
close
to
the
door
as
the
man
rushed
toward
her
she
shot
a
bolt
into
place
not
quite
so
fast
mr
bowman
she
said
smiling
we
really
must
have
a
chat
with
you
chapter
man
in
with
the
door
locked
the
man
saw
that
he
could
not
hope
to
escape
accepting
the
situation
he
regarded
parker
and
penny
with
cold
disdain
all
right
my
name
is
ben
bowman
he
acknowledged
shrugging
so
what
you
the
man
who
has
been
sending
me
collect
messages
for
the
past
three
months
parker
accused
and
what
if
i
have
is
there
any
law
against
it
you
run
a
lousy
paper
and
as
a
reader
i
have
a
right
to
complain
but
not
at
my
expense
another
thing
i
want
to
know
what
connection
you
had
with
clyde
blake
never
heard
of
him
then
you
do
own
property
in
this
city
nor
anywhere
else
now
if
you
through
giving
me
the
third
degree
i
move
on
not
so
fast
interposed
penny
refusing
to
unbar
the
door
if
i
not
mistaken
you
the
same
man
who
is
wanted
at
claymore
for
forging
a
cheque
really
this
is
too
much
ben
bowman
exclaimed
angrily
unless
you
permit
me
to
pass
i
shall
protest
to
the
police
i
see
an
officer
just
across
the
street
parker
declared
penny
will
you
call
him
over
just
a
minute
ben
bowman
interposed
in
an
altered
tone
we
can
settle
this
ourselves
i
admit
i
was
hasty
in
sending
those
messages
just
a
way
to
let
off
steam
i
guess
if
you
willing
to
forget
about
it
repay
you
for
every
dollar
you
spent
i
afraid
i
ca
forget
that
easily
parker
retorted
no
unless
you
willing
to
come
clean
about
your
connection
with
clyde
blake
have
to
call
the
police
what
do
you
want
to
know
about
him
is
he
acting
as
your
real
estate
agent
certainly
not
you
do
know
the
man
i
done
a
little
work
for
him
did
he
pay
you
to
allow
him
to
use
your
name
on
a
deed
he
gave
me
dollars
to
make
out
some
papers
for
him
i
only
copied
what
he
told
me
to
write
that
all
i
want
to
know
parker
said
grimly
penny
call
the
policeman
see
here
bowman
protested
furiously
you
intimated
that
if
i
told
what
i
knew
about
blake
you
let
me
off
why
you
as
yellow
as
that
paper
you
run
i
make
no
deals
with
men
of
your
stamp
parker
retorted
as
penny
unlocked
the
door
ben
bowman
made
a
break
for
freedom
however
the
editor
was
entirely
prepared
seizing
the
man
he
held
him
until
penny
could
summon
the
policeman
still
struggling
bowman
was
loaded
into
a
patrol
wagon
and
taken
to
police
headquarters
i
guess
that
earns
me
a
nice
little
one
hundred
dollars
penny
remarked
as
she
and
her
father
went
to
their
own
car
thanks
dad
you
entirely
welcome
parker
grinned
i
never
took
greater
pleasure
in
acknowledging
a
debt
what
your
next
move
dad
will
you
expose
clyde
blake
in
i
tempted
to
do
it
penny
the
evidence
still
is
rather
flimsy
but
even
if
ben
bowman
denies
his
story
i
think
we
can
prove
our
charges
it
a
pity
you
ca
break
the
hood
yarn
in
the
same
edition
penny
said
musingly
what
a
front
page
that
would
make
it
certainly
would
be
a
good
three
pennies
worth
parker
agreed
unfortunately
it
will
be
many
days
before
the
hoods
are
supposed
to
hold
their
meeting
at
the
tower
but
why
wait
we
could
call
that
gathering
ourselves
just
how
simple
as
pie
all
we
would
need
to
do
would
be
to
have
the
clock
strike
thirteen
instead
of
twelve
penny
glanced
at
her
wrist
watch
and
added
persuasively
we
have
several
hours
in
which
to
work
you
completely
crazy
accused
parker
just
how
would
you
arrange
to
have
the
clock
strike
thirteen
i
take
care
of
that
part
dad
all
i
need
is
a
hammer
to
use
on
the
caretaker
charley
phelps
i
suppose
parker
remarked
ironically
oh
no
penny
corrected
i
propose
to
turn
all
the
work
over
to
you
and
your
gang
of
reporters
naturally
phelps
will
have
to
be
removed
from
the
scene
what
you
propose
is
absolutely
impossible
the
editor
declared
even
so
i
admit
that
i
find
your
idea
rather
fascinating
this
is
no
time
for
being
conservative
dad
why
the
hoods
must
know
you
are
out
to
break
up
their
organization
every
day
you
wait
lessens
your
chance
of
getting
the
story
i
realize
that
only
too
well
penny
i
pinned
quite
a
bit
of
hope
on
clem
davis
his
failure
to
appear
puts
everything
in
a
different
light
why
not
test
what
he
told
us
penny
argued
it
will
be
easy
to
learn
if
the
striking
of
the
clock
is
a
signal
to
call
the
hood
meeting
if
the
men
should
come
we
have
them
arrested
and
run
a
big
story
tomorrow
morning
coming
from
your
lips
it
sounds
so
very
simple
parker
smiled
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
if
we
fail
we
probably
breakfast
at
the
police
station
why
worry
about
that
grinned
penny
you
have
influence
parker
sat
for
several
minutes
lost
in
thought
you
know
i
always
been
lucky
penny
coaxed
i
feel
a
double
dose
of
it
coming
on
tonight
i
believe
in
hunches
myself
parker
chuckled
no
doubt
i
making
the
biggest
mistake
of
my
life
but
i
going
to
try
your
wild
scheme
crazy
as
it
is
it
may
work
then
let
go
laughed
penny
at
the
office
parker
hastily
summoned
a
special
staff
of
newspaper
men
warning
them
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
get
out
a
special
edition
on
short
notice
from
the
group
he
chose
salt
sommers
jerry
livingston
and
two
reporters
known
for
their
pugilistic
prowess
now
this
is
the
line
up
boys
he
revealed
we
going
to
kidnap
charley
phelps
from
the
tower
it
risky
business
unless
things
break
right
for
us
so
if
any
of
you
want
to
drop
out
now
this
is
your
chance
we
with
you
chief
declared
salt
sommers
tossing
a
pack
of
photographic
supplies
over
his
shoulder
sure
what
are
we
waiting
for
chimed
in
jerry
it
was
well
after
eleven
by
the
time
the
press
car
drew
up
not
far
from
the
hubell
tower
penny
parked
on
a
dark
side
street
and
jerry
was
sent
to
look
over
the
situation
soon
he
returned
with
his
report
charley
phelps
is
alone
in
the
tower
he
assured
the
editor
we
should
have
any
trouble
handling
him
okay
then
let
do
the
job
parker
returned
remember
if
we
muff
it
we
do
our
explaining
to
a
judge
separating
into
groups
so
that
they
would
not
attract
attention
penny
and
the
five
men
approached
the
tower
a
light
glowed
from
within
and
the
caretaker
could
be
seen
moving
about
in
the
tiny
living
room
tying
handkerchiefs
over
their
faces
salt
and
jerry
rapped
on
the
back
door
charley
phelps
opened
it
to
find
himself
gazing
into
the
blinding
light
of
two
flashlights
say
what
he
began
but
did
not
finish
jerry
and
salt
had
seized
his
arms
before
he
could
make
another
sound
they
shoved
a
gag
into
his
mouth
and
dragging
him
into
the
tower
closed
the
door
working
swiftly
they
trussed
his
hands
and
feet
and
pushed
him
into
a
machinery
room
nice
work
boys
parker
praised
listen
whispered
penny
who
had
followed
the
men
into
the
tower
the
clock
had
begun
to
strike
the
hour
of
midnight
get
up
there
quickly
and
do
your
stuff
her
father
commanded
not
much
time
two
steps
at
a
time
penny
raced
up
the
steep
iron
stairway
which
led
to
the
belfry
of
the
tower
anxiously
she
counted
the
strokes
as
they
pealed
forth
loud
and
clearly
eight
nine
ten
the
clock
had
never
seemed
to
strike
so
fast
before
desperately
she
wondered
if
she
could
reach
the
belfry
in
time
the
stairway
was
dark
the
footing
uncertain
in
her
nervousness
penny
stumbled
clutching
the
handrail
she
clung
to
it
a
moment
until
she
had
recovered
balance
but
in
that
interval
the
clock
had
kept
striking
and
she
was
no
longer
sure
of
the
count
it
must
be
eleven
she
thought
running
up
the
remaining
steps
the
next
stroke
will
be
the
last
penny
reached
the
great
bell
just
as
the
clapper
struck
against
the
metal
the
sound
was
deafening
now
she
thought
excitedly
this
is
the
moment
and
i
dare
not
fail
balancing
herself
precariously
penny
raised
a
hammer
high
above
her
head
with
all
her
strength
she
brought
it
down
hard
against
the
bell
chapter
trap
to
penny
sensitive
ears
the
sound
which
resulted
from
the
hammer
blow
seemed
weak
and
lacking
in
resonance
she
sagged
back
against
the
iron
railing
feeling
that
she
had
failed
that
was
swell
a
low
voice
said
in
her
ear
a
perfect
thirteenth
stroke
turning
around
penny
saw
that
jerry
livingston
had
followed
her
into
the
belfry
did
it
really
sound
all
right
she
inquired
anxiously
it
was
good
enough
to
fool
anyone
but
the
question
is
will
it
bring
the
hoods
here
in
the
room
far
below
parker
had
lowered
the
blinds
of
the
circular
windows
making
certain
that
charley
phelps
was
securely
bound
and
gagged
so
that
he
could
make
no
sound
he
opened
the
front
door
a
tiny
crack
and
left
it
that
way
how
about
the
lights
salt
sommers
asked
leave
them
on
shove
that
sound
apparatus
under
the
daybed
now
i
guess
everything
set
upstairs
everyone
parker
salt
and
the
two
reporters
joined
penny
and
jerry
on
the
iron
stairway
we
may
have
a
long
vigil
the
editor
warned
in
fact
this
whole
scheme
is
likely
to
turn
out
a
bust
few
words
were
spoken
during
the
next
twenty
minutes
penny
stirred
restlessly
and
finally
went
to
join
jerry
who
was
maintaining
a
watch
from
the
belfry
see
anyone
she
whispered
scanning
the
street
below
no
sign
of
anyone
yet
at
intervals
automobiles
whizzed
past
the
tower
and
presently
one
drew
up
not
far
from
the
building
immediately
jerry
and
penny
focused
their
attention
upon
it
the
headlights
were
turned
to
parking
then
a
man
alighted
and
came
toward
the
hubell
tower
who
is
he
jerry
whispered
can
you
tell
i
not
sure
penny
said
uncertainly
it
may
be
hank
holloway
as
the
man
stepped
into
the
light
they
both
saw
that
her
identification
had
been
correct
the
man
rapped
on
the
door
several
times
receiving
no
answer
he
finally
entered
charley
those
on
the
iron
stairway
heard
him
call
where
are
you
the
brilliantly
lighted
living
room
combined
with
the
absence
of
the
caretaker
seemed
to
mystify
the
newcomer
muttering
to
himself
he
moved
restlessly
about
for
a
few
minutes
finally
seating
himself
he
picked
up
a
newspaper
and
began
to
read
from
their
post
in
the
belfry
penny
and
jerry
soon
observed
two
other
men
approaching
the
tower
one
they
recognized
as
a
workman
who
had
sorted
melons
at
the
davis
farm
but
his
companion
was
unknown
to
them
without
rapping
they
too
entered
the
building
where
charley
inquired
one
of
the
men
that
what
i
was
wondering
hank
holloway
replied
tossing
aside
his
paper
for
that
matter
i
ca
figure
out
why
this
special
meeting
was
called
something
important
must
have
come
up
within
ten
minutes
three
other
men
had
arrived
jerry
was
able
to
identify
two
of
them
by
name
but
he
dared
not
risk
whispering
the
information
to
parker
who
crouched
on
the
stairway
there
something
mighty
queer
about
this
meeting
hank
holloway
growled
where
is
the
master
and
what
become
of
charley
from
the
machinery
room
in
which
the
caretaker
had
been
imprisoned
came
a
slight
thumping
sound
what
was
that
hank
demanded
suspiciously
i
did
hear
anything
answered
one
of
the
other
men
maybe
it
was
someone
at
the
door
hank
tramped
across
the
room
to
peer
out
into
the
night
as
the
door
swung
back
a
dark
figure
moved
swiftly
along
the
hedge
crouching
low
who
there
hank
called
sharply
quiet
you
fool
was
the
harsh
response
a
man
wearing
a
dark
robe
and
a
black
hood
which
completely
hid
his
face
brushed
past
holloway
and
entered
the
tower
living
room
close
the
door
he
ordered
holloway
hastened
to
obey
an
expectant
and
rather
tense
silence
had
fallen
upon
the
men
gathered
in
the
room
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
the
master
demanded
facing
the
group
who
called
this
meeting
why
did
you
holloway
asked
blankly
i
did
not
all
i
know
is
that
i
heard
the
clock
strike
an
extra
stroke
holloway
explained
i
thought
it
was
queer
to
be
having
another
meeting
so
soon
then
i
found
charley
was
here
charley
not
here
the
master
exclaimed
he
must
have
stepped
out
somewhere
the
lights
were
on
and
the
door
partly
open
i
do
like
this
the
master
said
his
voice
harsh
charley
has
no
right
to
call
a
meeting
without
a
special
order
from
me
it
is
becoming
increasingly
dangerous
for
us
to
gather
here
now
you
talking
holloway
nodded
anthony
parker
of
the
is
on
the
warpath
again
one
of
his
reporters
has
been
prying
into
the
books
of
the
county
cooperative
he
learn
nothing
from
that
source
i
trust
not
enough
to
do
any
harm
you
act
as
though
you
had
a
grievance
holloway
any
complaints
why
no
the
cooperative
has
made
a
lot
of
money
since
you
taken
over
we
want
to
go
along
with
you
if
your
flare
for
the
dramatic
does
get
us
in
too
deep
what
do
you
mean
by
that
holloway
this
night
riding
business
is
getting
risky
why
if
clem
davis
should
talk
we
not
through
with
him
yet
another
thing
most
of
us
never
did
approve
of
holding
meetings
here
at
the
tower
hank
holloway
went
on
it
too
public
a
place
and
sooner
or
later
someone
will
start
asking
questions
about
what
goes
on
anything
else
well
we
think
you
ought
to
show
yourself
let
us
know
who
you
are
we
all
in
this
together
and
we
ought
to
take
the
same
risks
been
carrying
the
heavy
end
that
settles
it
the
masked
man
said
with
finality
we
through
how
do
you
mean
holloway
asked
we
breaking
up
the
organization
now
tonight
there
no
call
to
do
that
holloway
you
do
a
lot
of
talking
and
not
much
thinking
the
other
snapped
this
will
be
our
last
meeting
we
divide
the
profits
and
for
a
time
at
least
remain
inactive
that
all
very
well
for
you
holloway
complained
you
step
out
of
it
without
anyone
even
knowing
who
you
are
but
some
of
us
are
tied
up
with
the
county
cooperative
if
there
any
investigation
we
take
the
rap
there
will
be
no
investigation
that
easy
to
say
holloway
argued
i
do
like
the
way
things
have
been
going
lately
if
we
breaking
up
we
have
a
right
to
know
who
you
are
sure
chimed
in
another
remove
your
mask
and
let
have
a
look
we
think
we
have
your
number
but
we
ai
positive
you
never
will
be
the
masked
man
returned
coolly
backing
toward
the
door
and
now
goodnight
oh
no
you
do
holloway
cried
trying
to
head
him
off
stand
back
ordered
the
master
harshly
from
beneath
his
robe
he
whipped
a
revolver
all
right
holloway
sneered
i
never
argue
when
i
looking
into
a
muzzle
before
the
master
could
retreat
there
was
another
disturbance
from
inside
the
machinery
room
unmistakably
the
door
rattled
someone
is
in
there
holloway
exclaimed
startled
the
master
postponed
his
flight
still
holding
the
revolver
he
tried
to
open
the
door
but
found
it
locked
for
those
hiding
on
the
stairway
the
situation
had
become
a
tense
one
in
another
moment
the
members
of
the
black
hoods
unquestionably
would
break
the
door
lock
and
find
charley
phelps
let
take
chief
whispered
jerry
who
was
eager
for
action
now
is
our
only
chance
all
set
parker
gave
the
signal
with
a
concerted
rush
the
four
young
men
leaped
down
the
stairway
hurling
themselves
on
holloway
and
the
masked
man
catching
the
latter
unaware
jerry
knocked
the
revolver
from
his
hand
and
it
went
spinning
over
the
floor
penny
started
down
the
stairway
but
parker
pushed
her
back
stay
where
you
are
he
ordered
as
he
too
joined
the
fray
penny
huddled
against
the
wall
watching
fearfully
her
father
and
the
reporters
outnumbered
their
opponents
by
one
man
but
the
hoods
were
all
strong
powerful
fellows
who
fought
desperately
a
chair
crashed
against
the
lamp
shattering
it
in
the
resulting
darkness
she
no
longer
could
see
what
was
happening
suddenly
a
figure
broke
away
from
the
general
tangle
of
bodies
and
darted
toward
the
circular
stairway
for
a
moment
penny
believed
that
he
must
be
one
of
the
reporters
then
she
saw
that
the
man
wore
a
hood
over
his
face
the
master
she
thought
chills
racing
down
her
spine
he
trying
to
get
away
and
i
got
to
stop
him
chapter
as
the
man
started
up
the
stairway
penny
attempted
to
block
his
path
failing
to
trip
him
she
seized
his
arms
and
held
fast
out
of
my
way
the
man
cried
giving
her
a
hard
push
penny
clung
tightly
and
struggled
to
reach
the
hood
which
covered
his
face
suddenly
the
man
jerked
free
and
darted
on
up
the
steep
circular
stairway
pursuing
him
penny
was
able
to
seize
the
long
flowing
black
robe
only
to
have
it
tear
loose
in
her
hands
gaining
the
first
landing
midway
to
the
belfry
the
man
did
not
hesitate
swinging
his
legs
through
an
open
window
he
leaped
to
the
ground
twenty
feet
below
he
be
killed
penny
thought
reaching
the
window
she
saw
the
man
lying
in
a
heap
at
the
base
of
the
tower
for
a
moment
he
remained
motionless
but
as
she
watched
he
slowly
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
staggered
off
until
the
man
ducked
behind
the
high
hedge
penny
saw
him
plainly
silhouetted
in
the
moonlight
although
his
black
hood
remained
in
place
his
body
no
longer
was
covered
by
the
dark
robe
i
know
him
she
thought
even
with
his
mask
on
i
sure
i
ca
be
wrong
fearing
to
attempt
the
hazardous
leap
penny
ran
down
the
iron
stairway
shouting
that
the
master
of
the
hoods
had
escaped
by
this
time
parker
crew
of
reporters
had
gained
the
upperhand
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
organization
which
way
did
the
fellow
go
the
editor
demanded
running
to
the
door
along
the
hedge
toward
the
street
penny
directed
leaving
jerry
salt
and
the
others
to
guard
the
prisoners
parker
and
his
daughter
hastened
outdoors
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tower
he
ca
be
far
away
penny
maintained
anyway
i
know
his
identity
you
saw
his
face
no
but
as
he
ran
across
the
yard
i
noticed
that
one
arm
was
much
shorter
than
the
other
clyde
blake
that
what
i
think
maybe
we
can
catch
him
at
his
home
if
blake
is
our
man
we
get
him
parker
said
tersely
we
may
need
help
though
reentering
the
tower
building
he
telephoned
police
headquarters
asking
that
a
patrol
wagon
be
sent
for
hank
holloway
charley
phelps
and
the
other
prisoners
send
a
squad
to
clyde
blake
home
he
added
crisply
i
meet
your
men
there
and
provide
all
the
evidence
they
need
to
make
the
arrests
jerry
salt
and
the
two
reporters
were
instructed
to
remain
at
the
tower
pending
the
arrival
of
the
patrol
wagon
there
was
slight
danger
that
any
of
the
prisoners
could
escape
for
all
the
captives
had
been
locked
into
the
machinery
room
delaying
only
long
enough
to
obtain
the
case
of
sound
equipment
hidden
beneath
the
daybed
parker
and
penny
hastened
to
the
waiting
press
car
dad
she
marveled
as
they
passed
near
a
street
light
you
should
see
your
eye
it
turning
black
someone
must
have
pasted
you
hard
never
mind
that
now
he
returned
indifferently
we
out
for
a
big
story
and
we
going
to
get
it
too
the
police
cruiser
which
had
been
summoned
was
not
in
sight
by
the
time
parker
and
penny
reached
the
blake
home
at
first
glance
the
house
seemed
to
be
dark
however
a
dim
light
glowed
from
the
windows
of
one
of
the
upstairs
rear
bedrooms
we
not
wait
for
the
police
parker
said
starting
up
the
walk
his
knock
at
the
door
went
unanswered
even
when
the
editor
pounded
with
his
fist
no
one
came
to
admit
him
someone
is
inside
penny
declared
peering
up
at
the
lighted
window
it
must
be
blake
parker
tried
the
door
and
finding
it
unlocked
stepped
boldly
into
the
living
room
blake
he
shouted
on
the
floor
above
parker
and
penny
heard
the
soft
pad
of
slippered
feet
the
real
estate
man
garbed
in
a
black
silk
dressing
gown
gazed
down
over
the
balustrade
who
is
there
he
called
anthony
parker
from
the
i
want
to
talk
with
you
slowly
clyde
blake
descended
the
stairway
his
gait
was
stiff
and
deliberate
you
seem
to
have
injured
your
leg
parker
said
significantly
i
stumbled
on
the
stairway
not
fifteen
minutes
ago
blake
answered
twisted
my
ankle
may
i
ask
why
i
am
honored
with
a
visit
at
this
hour
you
know
why
i
am
here
parker
retorted
reaching
to
switch
on
a
living
room
light
indeed
i
do
deliberately
blake
moved
away
from
the
bridge
lamp
into
the
shadow
but
not
before
both
penny
and
her
father
had
noted
a
long
ugly
scratch
across
his
cheek
it
no
use
to
pretend
parker
said
sharply
i
have
all
the
evidence
i
need
to
convict
you
of
being
a
ringleader
of
the
hoods
you
are
quite
mad
the
real
estate
man
sneered
parker
i
put
up
with
you
and
your
methods
quite
long
enough
you
queered
my
deal
with
the
orphans
camp
board
now
you
accuse
me
of
being
a
member
of
a
disreputable
organization
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
you
always
been
a
good
talker
blake
but
this
time
it
will
get
you
nowhere
my
reporters
were
at
the
hubell
tower
i
have
a
complete
sound
record
of
what
transpired
there
either
give
yourself
up
or
the
police
will
take
you
by
force
so
you
notified
the
police
i
have
in
that
case
blake
smile
was
tight
with
a
dextrousness
which
caught
penny
and
her
father
completely
off
guard
he
whipped
a
revolver
from
beneath
his
dressing
robe
in
that
case
he
completed
handle
it
this
way
raise
your
hands
if
you
please
your
politeness
quite
overpowers
me
the
editor
said
sarcastically
as
he
obeyed
now
turn
your
back
and
walk
to
the
telephone
blake
went
on
call
the
police
station
and
tell
the
chief
that
you
made
a
mistake
in
asking
for
my
arrest
this
will
get
you
nowhere
blake
do
as
i
say
parker
went
to
the
telephone
stalling
for
time
by
pretending
that
he
did
not
know
the
police
station
number
garfield
blake
supplied
say
exactly
what
i
tell
you
or
taste
one
of
my
little
bullets
the
real
estate
man
stood
with
his
back
to
the
darkened
dining
room
in
such
position
that
he
could
cover
both
parker
and
penny
as
the
editor
began
to
dial
the
phone
he
backed
a
step
nearer
the
archway
behind
him
the
dark
velvet
curtains
moved
slightly
penny
noted
the
movement
but
gave
no
indication
of
it
the
next
instant
a
muscular
arm
reached
through
the
velvet
folds
seizing
blake
from
the
rear
the
revolver
was
torn
from
his
hand
dropping
the
telephone
parker
snatched
up
the
weapon
and
covered
blake
all
right
it
your
turn
to
reach
he
said
as
blake
slowly
raised
his
hands
another
man
stepped
into
the
circle
of
light
he
wore
rough
garments
and
had
not
shaved
in
many
days
clem
davis
penny
exclaimed
i
came
here
to
get
blake
the
man
said
briefly
i
thought
for
a
long
time
he
was
the
person
responsible
for
all
my
trouble
tonight
when
the
clock
struck
thirteen
i
watched
the
hubell
tower
i
saw
blake
put
on
his
hood
and
robe
and
then
enter
the
building
so
i
knew
he
was
the
master
you
willing
to
testify
to
that
parker
asked
yes
clem
davis
nodded
i
been
thinking
things
over
i
ready
to
give
myself
up
and
tell
what
i
know
you
have
a
very
difficult
time
of
it
proving
your
absurd
charges
blake
said
scathingly
i
think
not
parker
corrected
ben
bowman
was
captured
tonight
and
he
already
confessed
his
part
in
the
real
estate
swindle
even
if
you
were
mixed
up
with
the
hoods
you
go
to
jail
for
that
blake
sagged
into
a
chair
for
the
first
time
looking
shaken
i
make
a
deal
with
you
parker
he
began
but
the
editor
cut
him
short
you
face
the
music
no
blake
you
ca
squeeze
out
of
it
this
time
a
car
had
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house
running
to
the
window
penny
saw
three
policemen
crossing
the
street
she
hurried
to
the
door
to
open
it
for
them
here
your
man
parker
said
as
the
policemen
tramped
into
the
living
room
turning
the
revolver
over
to
one
of
the
officers
he
disclosed
exactly
what
had
occurred
blake
was
immediately
placed
under
arrest
he
was
granted
ten
minutes
to
change
into
street
clothing
and
prepare
for
his
long
sojourn
in
jail
i
am
being
persecuted
he
whined
as
he
was
led
away
this
is
all
a
trick
to
build
up
circulation
for
the
if
there
is
such
an
organization
as
the
black
hoods
clem
davis
is
the
man
who
heads
it
penny
and
parker
felt
very
grateful
to
the
fugitive
who
had
come
to
their
aid
at
such
a
timely
moment
they
wished
to
help
him
if
they
could
but
they
knew
he
could
not
escape
arrest
clem
davis
realized
it
too
for
he
made
no
protest
when
told
that
sheriff
daniels
must
be
called
i
ready
to
give
myself
up
he
repeated
i
was
a
member
of
the
hoods
but
i
never
went
along
with
them
once
i
learned
that
they
meant
to
defraud
the
truck
farmers
i
hope
i
can
prove
my
innocence
within
a
few
minutes
sheriff
daniels
arrived
to
assume
charge
of
his
prisoner
entertaining
no
sympathy
for
the
man
he
told
penny
and
her
father
that
in
all
likelihood
davis
must
serve
a
long
sentence
he
wanted
for
setting
fire
to
the
preston
barn
the
sheriff
insisted
unless
he
can
prove
an
alibi
for
himself
he
has
a
chance
ca
you
tell
where
you
were
at
the
time
of
the
fire
parker
asked
the
man
i
was
at
a
place
called
toni
why
that
right
dad
penny
cried
do
you
remember
we
saw
davis
leave
the
place
and
he
was
followed
by
two
men
probably
members
of
the
hood
organization
we
saw
a
man
leave
there
shortly
after
midnight
parker
agreed
you
would
swear
he
was
clem
davis
the
sheriff
asked
i
not
sure
parker
admitted
truthfully
however
it
obvious
that
a
man
scarcely
could
have
gone
from
toni
at
that
time
and
still
set
fire
to
the
barn
my
daughter
and
i
drove
directly
there
and
when
we
arrived
the
building
had
been
burning
for
some
time
all
of
which
proves
nothing
unless
you
can
show
that
clem
davis
actually
was
at
toni
after
midnight
could
the
owner
of
the
place
identify
you
penny
thoughtfully
inquired
i
doubt
it
davis
answered
it
might
be
worth
a
try
though
perhaps
i
can
prove
that
you
were
near
the
preston
farm
at
midnight
penny
exclaimed
as
a
sudden
idea
came
to
her
clem
you
heard
the
hubell
clock
strike
the
hour
yes
i
did
how
many
strokes
were
there
thirteen
davis
answered
without
hesitation
i
counted
them
and
figured
the
hoods
were
having
one
of
their
what
is
this
the
sheriff
demanded
in
bewilderment
we
can
prove
that
the
hubell
clock
did
strike
thirteen
on
that
particular
night
penny
resumed
it
was
a
signal
used
by
the
hoods
but
that
not
the
point
what
are
you
getting
at
just
this
the
hubell
clock
ca
be
heard
at
the
preston
farm
true
one
can
still
hear
the
clock
at
toni
but
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
it
you
see
if
davis
heard
the
thirteenth
stroke
he
have
had
time
to
reach
the
preston
farm
and
set
the
fire
that
an
interesting
argument
the
sheriff
said
smiling
and
you
plead
clem
case
very
earnestly
i
tell
you
what
i
do
investigate
all
these
angles
you
brought
up
and
if
the
evidence
supports
your
theory
i
promise
he
go
free
that
fair
enough
declared
parker
the
sheriff
did
not
handcuff
his
prisoner
as
they
were
leaving
the
house
clem
davis
turned
to
thank
penny
for
her
interest
in
his
behalf
oh
i
almost
forgot
he
said
taking
a
rectangular
metal
object
from
beneath
his
baggy
coat
here
something
for
you
a
rusty
automobile
license
plate
penny
exclaimed
staring
at
it
found
it
in
the
swamp
not
far
from
that
abandoned
car
i
told
you
about
then
it
must
have
been
thrown
away
by
the
driver
of
the
car
that
how
i
figure
clem
davis
drawled
if
you
can
learn
the
owner
of
this
license
plate
you
know
who
killed
that
orphan
folks
chapter
lights
blazed
on
every
floor
of
the
building
proclaiming
to
all
who
passed
that
another
special
edition
was
in
the
process
of
birth
pressmen
industriously
oiled
the
big
rotaries
ready
for
a
big
run
of
papers
linotype
men
compositors
reporters
all
were
at
their
posts
having
been
hastily
summoned
from
comfortable
beds
in
the
editor
office
penny
sat
at
a
typewriter
hammering
out
copy
jerking
a
long
sheet
of
paper
from
beneath
the
roller
she
offered
it
to
her
father
my
contribution
on
the
hubell
clock
angle
she
said
with
a
flourish
parker
rapidly
scanned
the
story
making
a
number
of
corrections
with
a
blue
pencil
i
should
slug
this
material
he
remarked
with
a
grin
quite
a
plug
you
put
in
for
seth
mcguire
suggesting
that
he
be
given
back
his
old
job
as
caretaker
of
the
tower
well
do
you
think
it
a
good
idea
the
old
man
will
get
his
job
back
i
see
to
that
parker
promised
but
the
front
page
of
the
is
not
the
place
to
express
wishful
thinking
we
reserve
it
for
news
if
you
do
mind
crossing
out
several
lines
parker
placed
the
copy
in
a
pneumatic
tube
and
shot
it
directly
to
the
composing
room
he
glanced
at
his
watch
noting
aloud
that
in
exactly
seven
minutes
the
giant
presses
would
start
rolling
everything
certainly
has
turned
out
grand
penny
sighed
happily
hank
holloway
and
clyde
blake
are
sure
to
be
given
long
prison
sentences
for
their
black
hood
activities
you
promised
to
see
that
old
seth
gets
his
job
back
so
that
part
will
end
beautifully
he
adopt
adelle
and
i
wo
need
to
worry
about
her
any
more
what
makes
you
think
seth
will
adopt
the
orphan
parker
asked
curiously
why
he
wanted
to
do
it
from
the
first
he
hesitated
because
he
had
no
steady
work
and
not
enough
money
by
the
way
dad
how
long
will
it
take
to
learn
the
owner
of
that
automobile
license
plate
that
clem
davis
gave
us
jerry
is
trying
to
get
the
information
now
penny
all
the
registry
offices
are
closed
but
if
he
can
pull
some
official
out
of
bed
a
chance
he
may
obtain
the
data
tonight
i
not
counting
on
it
however
the
door
of
the
office
swung
back
and
city
editor
dewitt
hurried
into
the
room
everything
set
parker
inquired
we
need
a
picture
of
clyde
blake
there
nothing
in
the
morgue
salt
sommers
has
one
you
might
use
penny
cried
it
was
taken
when
blake
came
here
the
other
day
he
objected
to
it
because
it
showed
that
one
arm
was
shorter
than
the
other
just
what
we
need
dewitt
approved
i
rush
it
right
out
except
for
the
picture
the
front
page
is
all
made
up
the
door
closed
behind
the
city
editor
but
before
parker
could
settle
comfortably
into
his
chair
it
burst
open
again
jerry
livingston
breathless
from
running
up
several
flights
of
stairs
faced
his
chief
i
got
all
the
dope
he
announced
you
learned
who
drove
the
car
penny
demanded
eagerly
the
license
was
issued
in
clyde
blake
name
then
adelle
identification
at
the
picnic
was
correct
penny
exclaimed
write
your
story
jerry
but
make
it
brief
parker
said
tersely
we
make
over
the
front
page
calling
dewitt
he
gave
the
new
order
in
the
composing
room
headlines
were
jerked
and
a
story
of
minor
importance
was
pulled
from
the
form
to
make
room
for
the
new
material
we
roll
three
minutes
late
parker
said
glancing
at
his
watch
again
even
so
our
papers
will
make
all
the
trains
and
we
scoop
every
other
sheet
in
town
jerry
wrote
his
story
which
was
sent
paragraph
by
paragraph
to
the
composing
room
barely
had
he
typed
signifying
the
end
when
the
lights
of
the
room
dimmed
for
an
instant
there
go
the
presses
parker
declared
ceasing
his
restless
pacing
within
a
few
minutes
the
first
paper
still
fresh
with
ink
was
laid
upon
the
editor
desk
penny
peered
over
his
shoulder
to
read
the
headlines
announcing
the
arrest
of
blake
and
his
followers
there
not
much
here
about
ben
bowman
she
commented
after
a
moment
what
do
you
think
will
happen
to
him
dad
that
remains
to
be
seen
answered
the
editor
he
already
wanted
for
forgery
so
it
should
be
fairly
easy
to
prove
that
he
worked
with
blake
to
defraud
the
camp
board
i
worried
about
the
orphans
camp
so
much
money
has
been
spent
clearing
the
land
and
setting
up
equipment
probably
everything
can
be
settled
satisfactorily
in
the
end
parker
returned
it
may
take
time
and
litigation
but
there
no
reason
why
a
perfect
title
ca
be
obtained
to
the
land
penny
felt
very
well
pleased
at
the
way
everything
had
turned
out
only
one
small
matter
remained
unexplained
she
had
been
unable
to
learn
the
significance
of
the
watch
fob
found
in
clem
davis
stable
why
i
can
tell
you
about
that
jerry
livingston
assured
her
the
fob
belonged
