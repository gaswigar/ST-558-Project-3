handy
mandy
in
oz
on
many
a
day
had
handy
the
goat
girl
of
mern
pursued
her
goats
up
and
down
the
rocky
eminences
of
her
native
mountain
and
never
never
in
her
fourteen
or
so
years
experience
had
she
been
blown
up
by
a
mountain
spring
but
there
comes
in
every
experience
a
day
which
is
unlike
every
other
day
and
so
it
was
with
the
goat
girl
as
she
was
pursuing
her
favorite
goat
there
was
a
sudden
crash
a
whish
and
up
flew
the
slab
of
rock
on

she
was
standing
up

away
the
adventures

was

elements
of
wonder
in

life
around
them
to
realize
that
even

and

may
be
transformed
into

lore
if
only
we
have
sufficient
energy
and
vision
to
penetrate
to
their
significance
and
transform
them
to

mandy

high
and
clear
above
the
peaks
of
mt

floated
the
voice
of
the
goat
girl
calling
the
finest
fattest
but
most
troublesome
of
her
flock
all
the
other
goats
were
winding
obediently
down
toward
the
village
that
perched
precariously
on
the
edge
of
the
mountain
but
of
there
was
not
a
single
sign
nor
whisker
serves
me
right
for
spoiling
the
contrary
creature
panted
mandy
pushing
back
her
thick
yellow
braids
with
her
second
best
hand
always
wants
her
own
way
that
goat
so
she
does
i
say
come
down
here
this
instant
but
only
the
tantalizing
tinkle
of
the
goat
silver
bell
came
to
answer
her
for
was
climbing
up
not
down
and
there
was
nothing
for
mandy
to
do
but
go
after
her
muttering
dire
threats
which
she
was
much
too
soft
hearted
ever
to
carry
out
the
rosy
cheeked
mountain
lass
scrambled
over
crags
and
stones
pulling
herself
up
steep
precipices
the
goat
always
managing
to
keep
a
few
jumps
ahead
till
soon
they
were
almost
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
here
stopping
on
a
jutting
rock
to
catch
her
breath
and
remove
the
burrs
from
her
stockings
mandy
heard
a
dreadful
roar
and
felt
an
ominous
rumbling
beneath
her
feet
on
a
narrow
ledge
just
above
heard
it
too
and
cocked
her
head
anxiously
on
one
side
perhaps
she
had
best
jump
down
to
mandy
after
all
the
great
silly
girl
did
feed
and
pet
her
and
from
the
sound
of
things
a
storm
was
brewing
if
there
was
one
thing
the
goat
feared
more
than
another
it
was
a
so
rolling
her
eyes
as
innocently
as
if
she
had
not
dragged
mandy
all
over
the
mountain
she
stretched
her
nose
down
toward
her
weary
mistress
bah
bleated
affectionately
oh
yourself
fumed
mandy
making
an
angry
snatch
for
the
nanny
goat
beard
pets
and
children
are
all
alike
never
appreciate
a
body
till
they
have
a
stomach
ache
or
a
is
coming
now
then
be
quick
with
you
holding
out
her
strong
arms
mandy
made
ready
to
catch
the
goat
as
it
jumped
off
the
ledge
but
before
could
stir
there
was
a
perfectly
awful
crash
and
explosion
and
up
shot
the
slab
of
rock
on
which
mandy
was
standing
up
up
and
out
of
sight
entirely
where
the
mountain
girl
had
been
a
crystal
column
of
water
spurted
viciously
into
the
air
so
high
the
bulging
eyes
of
the
goat
could
see
no
end
to
it
rearing
up
on
her
hind
legs
turned
round
and
round
in
a
frantic
effort
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
vanishing
mistress
then
thinking
suddenly
what
would
happen
should
the
torrent
turn
and
fall
upon
her
the
goat
sprang
off
the
ledge
and
ran
madly
down
the
mountain
bleating
like
a
whole
herd
of
banshees
and
mandy
as
you
can
well
believe
was
as
frightened
as
and
with
twice
as
much
reason
the
first
upheaval
as
the
rock
left
the
earth
flung
her
flat
on
her
nose
grasping
the
edges
of
the
slab
with
all
hands
mandy
hung
on
for
dear
life
and
as
a
stinging
shower
of
icy
water
sprayed
her
from
head
to
foot
wondered
what
under
the
earth
was
happening
to
her
thorns
and
thistles
could
the
really
have
come
up
instead
of
down
certainly
it
was
raining
up
and
what
ever
was
carrying
her
aloft
with
such
terrible
force
and
relentlessness
how
could
the
goat
girl
know
that
a
turbulent
spring
pent
up
for
thousands
of
years
in
the
center
of
mt
mern
had
suddenly
burst
its
way
to
freedom
and
you
have
no
idea
of
the
tremendous
power
in
a
mountain
spring
once
it
uncoils
and
lets
itself
go
mandy
rock
might
just
as
well
have
been
shot
into
the
air
by
a
magic
cannon
first
it
tore
upward
as
if
it
meant
to
knock
a
hole
in
the
sky
then
still
travelling
at
incalculable
speed
began
to
arch
and
take
a
horizontal
course
over
the
mountains
hills
and
valleys
west
of
mern
all
poor
mandy
knew
was
that
she
was
hurtling
through
space
at
speed
with
nothing
to
save
or
stop
her
the
long
yellow
braids
of
the
goat
girl
streamed
out
like
pennants
while
her
striped
skirt
and
voluminous
petticoats
snapped
and
fluttered
like
banners
in
the
wind
oh
moaned
mandy
gazing
wildly
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
but
pshaw
what
was
the
use
of
calling
even
if
she
heard
could
not
fly
after
her
through
the
air
and
when
she
herself
came
down
not
even
her
own
goat
would
recognize
her
at
this
depressing
thought
mandy
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
and
began
to
weep
bitterly
for
she
was
quite
sure
she
would
never
see
her
friends
her
home
or
her
goats
again
but
the
rough
and
frugal
life
on
mt
mern
had
made
the
goat
girl
both
brave
and
resourceful
so
she
soon
dried
her
tears
and
as
the
rock
still
showed
no
signs
of
slowing
up
nor
dashing
down
she
began
to
take
heart
and
even
a
desperate
sort
of
interest
in
her
experience
slowly
and
cautiously
she
pulled
herself
to
a
sitting
position
and
still
clutching
the
edges
of
the
rock
dared
to
look
down
at
the
countries
and
towns
flashing
away
below
after
all
sniffed
the
reckless
maiden
nothing
very
dreadful
has
happened
yet
i
always
wanted
to
travel
and
now
i
am
travelling
not
many
people
have
flown
through
the
air
on
a
rock
why
it
really
a
rocket
decided
mandy
with
a
nervous
giggle
and
that
i
suppose
makes
me
the
first
rocket
rider
in
the
country
and
the
last
too
she
finished
soberly
as
she
measured
with
her
eye
the
distance
she
would
plunge
when
her
rock
started
earthward
now
if
we
just
come
down
in
that
blue
lake
below
i
might
have
a
chance
perhaps
i
should
jump
but
by
the
time
mandy
made
up
her
mind
to
jump
the
lake
was
far
behind
and
nothing
but
a
great
desert
of
smoking
sand
stretched
beneath
her
chapter
the
end
of
the
ride
the
sky
from
the
rosy
pink
of
late
afternoon
had
faded
to
a
depressing
grey
and
mandy
could
not
help
thinking
longingly
of
the
appetizing
little
supper
she
had
set
out
for
herself
before
going
up
to
call
the
goats
who
would
eat
it
now
or
even
know
she
was
flying
through
the
air
like
a
comet
no
one
she
concluded
drearily
for
mandy
was
an
orphan
and
lived
all
by
herself
in
a
small
cottage
on
mt
mern
high
above
the
village
of
fistikins
in
a
day
or
two
some
of
her
friends
in
the
village
might
search
the
cottage
and
find
her
gone
but
now
now
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
sit
tight
and
hope
for
the
best
mandy
next
glance
down
was
more
encouraging
instead
of
the
dangerous
looking
desert
she
was
sailing
over
misty
blue
hills
and
valleys
dotted
with
many
small
towns
and
villages
high
as
she
was
she
could
even
hear
the
church
bells
tolling
the
hour
and
this
made
mandy
feel
more
lost
and
lonely
than
ever
all
these
people
below
were
safely
at
home
and
about
to
eat
their
suppers
while
she
was
flying
high
and
far
from
everything
she
knew
and
loved
best
hungrily
the
goat
girl
cast
her
eyes
over
the
rock
she
was
riding
thinking
to
find
a
small
sprig
of
mountain
berries
or
even
a
blade
of
grass
to
nibble
at
first
glance
the
rock
seemed
bare
and
barren
then
sticking
up
out
of
a
narrow
crevice
mandy
spied
a
tiny
blue
flower
poor
little
posy
it
as
far
from
home
as
i
am
murmured
the
goat
girl
and
carefully
breaking
the
stem
she
lifted
the
blue
flower
to
her
nose
its
faint
fragrance
was
vaguely
comforting
and
mandy
had
just
begun
to
count
the
petals
when
the
rock
gave
a
sickening
lurch
and
started
to
pitch
down
so
fast
mandy
braids
snapped
like
jumping
ropes
and
her
skirts
bellied
out
like
a
parachute
in
a
gale
now
for
it
gasped
the
goat
girl
closing
her
eyes
and
clenching
her
teeth
oh
my
poor
little
shins
mandy
shins
were
both
stout
and
sturdy
but
even
so
we
can
not
blame
mandy
for
pitying
them
stouter
shins
than
hers
would
have
splintered
at
such
a
fall
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
doing
mandy
began
to
pull
the
petals
from
the
blue
flower
calling
in
an
agonized
voice
as
she
pulled
each
one
the
names
of
her
goats
and
friends
she
had
just
come
to
speckle
the
smallest
member
of
her
flock
when
the
end
came
kimmeny
jimmeny
was
this
all
opening
one
eye
the
goat
girl
looked
fearfully
about
her
she
was
sitting
on
top
of
a
haystack
no
not
a
haystack
but
a
heap
of
soft
blue
flower
petals
as
soft
as
down
opening
the
other
eye
she
saw
the
rock
on
which
she
had
travelled
so
far
bump
over
a
golden
fence
and
fall
with
a
satisfied
splash
into
a
shimmering
lake
but
what
lay
beyond
the
lake
made
mandy
forget
all
her
troubles
and
fairly
moan
with
surprise
and
pleasure
a
castle
exulted
the
goat
girl
putting
one
hand
above
her
heart
oh
i
always
wanted
to
see
a
castle
and
now
i
am
and
this
castle
let
me
tell
you
was
well
worth
anyone
seeing
a
castle
of
lacy
blue
marble
carved
and
decorated
with
precious
stones
in
a
way
to
astonish
the
eyes
of
a
simple
mountain
lass
from
the
tallest
tower
a
silken
pennant
floated
lazily
in
the
evening
breeze
mandy
spelled
out
slowly
sliding
off
the
heap
of
flower
petals
she
stood
for
a
long
delicious
moment
lost
in
admiration
then
giving
herself
a
businesslike
shake
to
be
sure
she
was
not
broken
or
bent
by
her
amazing
flight
and
tumble
mandy
turned
to
examine
the
rest
of
her
surroundings
when
she
looked
at
the
spot
on
which
she
had
fallen
the
stack
of
blue
petals
had
disappeared
but
there
twinkling
up
cheerfully
was
the
blue
flower
as
much
at
home
as
if
it
had
grown
there
in
the
first
place
thoroughly
puzzled
mandy
picked
the
little
flower
a
second
time
and
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
even
without
the
mystery
of
the
blue
flower
it
was
astonishing
enough
to
find
herself
in
the
stately
park
of
this
gorgeous
blue
castle
there
was
a
tree
lined
avenue
and
velvety
lawns
splashed
with
star
shaped
flower
beds
stretched
in
every
direction
only
the
small
patch
of
land
on
which
she
was
standing
was
bare
and
uncultivated
and
evidently
someone
was
at
work
here
for
a
great
white
ox
with
golden
horns
yoked
to
a
gold
plow
stood
with
his
back
to
mandy
dozing
cozily
in
the
pleasant
dusk
at
sight
of
the
ox
mandy
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
and
content
long
ago
an
old
mountain
woman
had
given
her
this
sensible
piece
of
advice
when
you
do
not
know
what
to
do
next
do
the
first
useful
piece
of
work
that
comes
to
hand
now
here
right
at
hand
was
a
useful
piece
of
work
and
while
she
was
trying
to
figure
out
the
whole
puzzle
of
the
flying
rock
and
strange
blue
flower
she
might
just
as
well
be
ploughing
then
when
the
owner
of
the
castle
saw
her
working
so
industriously
he
might
invite
her
to
supper
so
grasping
the
tail
of
the
ancient
plow
mandy
clicked
her
tongue
in
a
cheerful
signal
for
the
ox
to
start
the
white
ox
who
had
not
seen
nor
heard
the
goat
girl
till
this
minute
turned
his
head
in
a
lordly
fashion
and
gave
her
a
long
haughty
look
not
really
believing
what
he
saw
he
took
another
look
and
then
with
a
bellow
of
fright
and
outrage
went
charging
across
the
park
pulling
the
startled
goat
girl
behind
him
mandy
might
have
let
go
but
she
just
did
not
think
of
it
and
with
pounding
heart
and
flying
braids
held
fast
to
the
pitching
plough
as
it
tore
through
flower
beds
ripped
up
lawns
and
cut
fearful
furrows
in
the
pebbled
paths
clouds
of
earth
stones
and
whole
plants
uprooted
ruthlessly
from
their
beds
showered
round
her
ears
and
as
they
reached
the
palace
a
hard
metal
object
hit
her
squarely
between
the
eyes
putting
up
a
hand
mandy
caught
the
flying
missile
and
mechanically
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
and
the
next
instant
the
ox
lunging
through
an
open
french
window
dragged
her
into
the
magnificently
furnished
throne
room
of
the
castle
not
only
into
the
throne
room
mind
you
but
into
the
lap
of
royalty
itself
chapter
the
king
of
keretaria
the
white
ox
in
his
mad
dash
across
the
throne
room
had
run
violently
into
a
marble
pillar
hurling
mandy
straight
into
the
arms
of
a
very
tall
very
stern
and
very
blue
looking
monarch
pages
and
courtiers
tripped
and
fell
left
and
right
in
a
scramble
to
get
out
of
the
way
while
the
ox
snorting
and
trembling
looked
balefully
over
his
shoulder
at
the
goat
girl
is
the
meaning
of
this
panted
the
king
unhand
me
woman
remove
your
finger
from
my
eye
and
your
arms
your
arms
hi
hi
hi
the
king
sentence
ended
in
three
frightened
squeaks
is
it
a
girl
or
an
octopus
he
puffed
heaving
up
his
chest
in
an
endeavor
to
dislodge
mandy
hi
hi
hi
are
you
going
to
allow
this
clumping
savage
to
insult
my
majesty
in
this
er
manner
as
the
goat
girl
by
this
time
scarlet
from
anger
and
mortification
jumped
off
the
king
lap
three
very
high
officials
of
the
court
of
keretaria
darted
forward
the
high
the
imperial
persuader
and
the
lord
high
upper
dupper
of
the
realm
bawled
a
page
having
delivered
himself
of
this
impressive
announcement
the
page
bolted
back
of
a
curtain
and
from
there
peered
with
astonished
eyes
at
the
visitor
everyone
in
the
grand
blue
throne
room
looked
frightened
and
ready
to
run
at
a
notice
wondering
what
could
be
the
matter
with
them
all
mandy
with
many
misgivings
watched
the
counselors
of
keretaria
advance
in
a
threatening
row
now
then
not
a
move
thundered
the
high
tapping
her
sharply
on
the
shoulder
with
a
golden
staff
shaped
like
a
huge
interrogation
point
it
is
my
duty
to
question
all
strangers
who
ride
fall
fly
or
break
into
our
kingdom
and
you
the
haughty
nobleman
gave
mandy
a
cold
blue
stare
you
are
stranger
than
any
stranger
who
has
ever
come
to
keretaria
it
is
my
duty
to
persuade
you
to
do
as
his
majesty
commands
stated
the
imperial
persuader
raising
his
gold
spiked
club
and
it
is
my
duty
to
put
you
in
your
place
sniffed
the
lord
high
upper
dupper
rattling
a
bunch
of
keys
that
hung
from
his
belt
well
if
you
ask
me
puffed
the
ox
rolling
his
eyes
wildly
round
at
the
goat
girl
her
place
is
in
a
museum
and
the
sooner
you
lock
her
upper
dupper
the
better
now
mandy
was
so
astonished
to
hear
the
ox
actually
speaking
she
gave
a
loud
cry
and
flung
up
her
hands
every
single
seven
of
them
help
help
yelped
the
courtiers
scurrying
like
mice
into
corners
and
corridors
only
the
white
ox
the
king
and
his
counselors
kept
their
places
how
dare
you
come
into
a
king
presence
armed
in
this
barbarous
fashion
gasped
the
high
taking
a
step
toward
the
goat
girl
but
too
frightened
to
touch
her
pigs
cried
mandy
suddenly
losing
her
temper
can
i
help
my
seven
arms
all
of
us
on
mt
mern
have
seven
arms
and
hands
and
you
with
your
skinny
two
seem
far
funnier
than
i
am
mandy
the
goat
girl
as
anyone
in
his
senses
can
see
the
girl
is
right
observed
the
ox
gazing
more
attentively
at
mandy
and
now
speaking
quite
calmly
she
can
no
more
help
those
seven
arms
than
you
can
help
those
seven
warts
on
your
nose
questo
i
tell
you
this
maiden
is
a
real
curiosity
and
if
you
three
will
cease
rattling
your
teeth
and
your
clubs
perhaps
she
will
explain
why
she
has
come
to
keretaria
i
myself
shall
call
her
handy
mandy
why
the
beast
has
more
sense
than
its
masters
thought
the
goat
girl
in
surprise
well
rumbled
the
king
ungraciously
if
you
have
anything
to
say
before
we
lock
you
up
say
it
but
do
not
wave
your
arms
about
please
swallowing
nervously
clasping
four
of
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
stuffing
the
other
three
into
convenient
pockets
in
her
apron
mandy
began
to
speak
i
was
driving
my
goats
home
from
the
mountain
your
majesty
when
the
rock
on
which
i
was
standing
exploded
suddenly
into
the
air
flew
like
a
bird
over
hill
valley
and
desert
and
dropped
me
into
your
garden
and
not
a
bruise
nor
a
bump
to
show
for
it
grunted
the
imperial
persuader
elevating
his
nose
to
show
he
was
not
taken
in
by
such
a
tale
in
spite
of
his
suspicious
glance
mandy
decided
to
say
nothing
of
the
blue
flower
that
had
so
miraculously
softened
her
fall
and
since
when
have
rocks
flown
through
the
air
inquired
the
lord
high
upper
dupper
sarcastically
ahem
in
the
garden
continued
mandy
undaunted
by
the
two
interruptions
i
saw
this
great
white
ox
and
thinking
to
do
a
bit
of
honest
work
for
my
supper
grasped
the
plough
but
that
was
a
little
oxident
murmured
the
great
beast
in
a
jovial
voice
for
catching
sight
of
a
maiden
all
at
once
and
without
warning
i
took
to
my
heels
and
landed
her
in
her
present
unpleasant
predicament
is
that
not
so
looking
at
the
ox
with
round
eyes
mandy
nodded
but
she
still
has
not
explained
all
these
arms
complained
the
imperial
persuader
whoever
heard
of
a
maiden
i
have
asserted
mandy
stoutly
and
what
pray
is
there
to
explain
this
iron
hand
the
goat
girl
raised
it
slowly
and
thoughtfully
as
she
spoke
i
use
for
ironing
lifting
hot
pots
from
the
stove
and
all
horrid
sort
of
hard
work
this
leather
hand
i
keep
for
beating
rugs
dusting
sweeping
and
so
on
this
wooden
hand
i
use
for
churning
and
digging
in
the
garden
these
two
red
rubber
hands
for
dishwashing
and
scrubbing
and
my
two
fine
white
hands
i
keep
for
holding
and
braiding
my
hair
with
all
seven
hands
extended
before
her
mandy
smiled
engagingly
up
at
the
king
undoubtedly
a
witch
whispered
the
imperial
persuader
darkly
as
the
king
in
spite
of
himself
gazed
curiously
down
at
his
visitor
a
dangerous
character
your
majesty
hissed
the
high
shaking
his
head
disapprovingly
to
the
dungeons
with
her
rasped
the
lord
high
upper
dupper
rattling
his
keys
like
castanets
what
bawled
the
white
ox
stamping
all
of
his
gold
shod
feet
in
rapid
succession
you
mean
to
consign
this
marvel
of
skill
and
efficiency
to
a
dungeon
what
a
set
of
dunces
you
are
come
handy
i
myself
will
take
you
for
a
slave
out
of
my
way
dolts
swaggering
a
bit
and
with
the
golden
plough
still
clanking
and
bumping
behind
him
the
ox
ambled
at
a
dignified
pace
toward
the
door
mandy
though
she
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
becoming
his
slave
was
greatly
relieved
at
the
interest
the
ox
was
taking
in
her
case
but
before
following
him
she
looked
inquiringly
up
at
the
king
yes
go
commanded
his
majesty
harshly
i
hereby
give
you
into
the
care
and
service
of
nox
the
royal
ox
of
keretaria
harm
one
hair
of
his
head
and
you
will
pay
for
it
with
your
life
and
perish
i
promise
you
most
ignominiously
mercy
ercy
muttered
mandy
tiptoeing
nervously
after
her
new
master
does
the
fellow
know
any
short
words
how
queer
everything
is
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
people
with
only
two
arms
animals
talking
and
giving
orders
to
kings
suppose
the
goats
at
home
started
bossing
the
villagers
and
what
would
the
villagers
think
of
her
strange
flight
and
reception
in
keretaria
well
from
what
she
herself
had
seen
of
royalty
decided
the
goat
girl
she
much
preferred
her
goats
or
even
the
company
of
this
haughty
white
ox
stepping
briskly
beside
him
mandy
resolved
to
humor
the
creature
till
she
saw
a
bit
more
of
the
country
or
found
some
safe
way
back
to
her
mountain
nox
swinging
along
at
his
own
indolent
gait
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
goat
girl
but
when
they
reached
his
royal
quarters
which
to
mandy
looked
more
like
a
castle
than
a
stable
he
began
bawling
so
fiercely
for
the
stable
boys
she
decided
uncomfortably
that
being
his
slave
might
prove
both
unpleasant
and
dangerous
however
when
six
little
boys
dressed
in
blue
overalls
and
aprons
ran
out
the
royal
ox
addressed
them
quite
kindly
the
first
without
waiting
for
instructions
unhitched
the
plough
and
lifted
the
yoke
from
the
royal
shoulders
prepare
kerry
quarters
for
my
new
slave
directed
nox
turning
to
the
second
and
third
you
others
bring
dinner
for
two
and
mind
you
fetch
handy
mandy
everything
they
have
at
the
king
table
with
a
playful
lunge
nox
started
them
smartly
on
their
way
then
moved
grandly
into
the
huge
stone
stable
and
along
to
his
own
luxurious
stall
my
y
exclaimed
the
goat
girl
sinking
breathlessly
to
a
three
legged
stool
how
grand
and
elegant
you
are
here
my
y
i
wish
could
see
this
one
of
your
goats
murmured
nox
burying
his
nose
in
the
huge
marble
bowl
he
used
for
a
drinking
trough
mandy
nodded
i
wish
she
were
here
now
she
added
with
a
rapturous
little
sigh
well
i
do
deliberately
the
royal
ox
licked
the
water
from
his
lips
do
you
suppose
i
allow
a
miserable
goat
in
my
sapphire
trimmed
stall
miserable
squealed
mandy
springing
off
the
stool
the
smartest
goat
on
the
mountain
she
would
give
two
bleats
and
a
bah
for
an
old
hoopadoop
like
you
hoopadoop
repeated
the
ox
in
a
dazed
whisper
do
you
mean
to
stand
there
and
call
the
royal
ox
of
keretaria
a
hoopadoop
yes
said
mandy
firmly
but
backing
off
a
bit
as
she
spoke
what
makes
you
think
you
so
much
better
than
a
goat
even
if
you
do
talk
put
on
airs
and
have
golden
horns
well
and
to
mandy
surprise
and
relief
nox
cleared
his
throat
and
grinned
quite
amiably
after
all
i
am
the
royal
ox
you
know
more
precious
to
the
king
than
all
his
court
and
subjects
everyone
jumps
at
my
least
command
so
why
should
i
put
on
a
few
airs
besides
do
you
think
it
polite
to
call
me
an
old
hoopadoop
when
i
just
saved
you
from
a
dungeon
no
admitted
mandy
resuming
her
seat
thoughtfully
i
do
suppose
it
is
maybe
you
as
good
as
a
goat
she
added
with
a
little
burst
of
generosity
oh
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
through
half
closed
eyes
the
royal
ox
looked
quizzically
at
the
goat
girl
i
believe
we
shall
get
on
famously
famously
the
truth
is
you
amuse
me
no
end
and
so
long
as
you
amuse
me
everything
will
be
smooth
as
silk
but
of
course
if
you
bore
me
i
will
bore
you
oh
positively
lowering
his
head
nox
shook
his
horns
playfully
now
i
should
try
that
if
i
were
you
advised
mandy
raising
her
iron
hand
and
cracking
the
fingers
warningly
for
if
you
do
i
might
throw
things
ha
ha
i
believe
you
would
the
enormous
beast
charmed
by
so
much
spirit
and
independence
fairly
beamed
upon
his
new
slave
i
take
it
you
are
pretty
good
at
throwing
things
yes
and
at
catching
them
too
reaching
up
mandy
took
seven
of
the
dozen
brushes
off
the
shelf
above
her
head
tossing
them
all
into
the
air
with
three
of
her
hands
she
caught
them
easily
with
the
other
four
then
dragging
her
stool
closer
she
began
brushing
the
coat
of
her
royal
charge
so
hard
and
vigorously
he
blinked
with
pleasure
and
astonishment
will
you
have
your
tail
plain
curled
or
plaited
asked
mandy
in
a
businesslike
voice
er
er
plain
thank
you
with
admiration
and
some
alarm
nox
regarded
the
whirling
arms
of
the
goat
girl
but
the
four
little
stable
boys
appearing
at
that
moment
stared
at
her
in
glassy
eyed
fright
and
consternation
for
nox
they
had
brought
a
tray
heaped
high
with
corn
and
oats
and
another
with
fresh
sliced
apples
for
mandy
there
were
two
trays
of
gold
dishes
containing
a
sample
of
everything
from
the
royal
table
dropping
her
brushes
mandy
seized
all
the
trays
at
once
in
her
various
hands
which
so
frightened
the
stable
boys
they
took
to
their
heels
yelling
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
winking
at
the
royal
ox
mandy
set
his
supper
on
the
gold
stand
meant
for
that
purpose
then
dropping
to
the
floor
before
her
own
two
trays
began
her
first
dinner
in
a
strange
land
and
what
a
strange
land
mused
mandy
helping
herself
from
the
gold
dishes
with
first
one
hand
and
then
another
well
inquired
nox
daintily
nibbling
his
oats
and
apples
is
this
not
better
than
bread
and
water
in
a
dungeon
cell
too
full
for
utterance
mandy
rapturously
nodded
chapter
the
message
in
the
horn
after
the
goat
girl
had
finished
her
supper
and
the
stable
boys
had
hurried
off
with
the
trays
nox
showed
his
new
slave
to
her
quarters
handy
mandy
who
had
expected
nothing
better
than
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
corner
of
an
empty
stall
decided
that
for
a
slave
she
was
faring
pretty
well
a
small
but
complete
apartment
had
been
built
in
the
wing
next
to
nox
stall
with
not
only
a
comfortable
bedroom
and
bath
but
a
small
sitting
room
as
well
the
bed
was
a
huge
gold
four
poster
with
blue
silk
sheets
and
comforters
never
in
her
hard
and
simple
life
had
handy
dreamed
of
such
elegance
here
try
the
chairs
urged
nox
trotting
almost
briskly
into
the
sitting
room
this
mandy
was
only
too
willing
to
do
and
the
pretty
little
room
with
its
book
shelves
lamps
and
pictures
seemed
to
the
honest
goat
girl
much
more
desirable
than
the
palace
all
belonged
to
kerry
mumbled
the
royal
ox
settling
himself
largely
on
a
white
rug
beside
her
was
kerry
one
of
your
slaves
asked
mandy
rocking
herself
cheerfully
to
and
fro
with
all
her
hands
resting
quietly
in
her
lap
slave
the
ox
spoke
sharply
i
should
say
not
kerry
was
a
king
our
own
little
king
up
to
a
few
years
ago
and
what
a
lad
he
was
what
a
lad
was
exclaimed
mandy
why
what
happened
to
him
he
disappeared
nox
told
her
sadly
nobody
knows
how
or
where
just
disappeared
my
girl
on
a
hunting
trip
and
this
blue
nosed
scoundrel
who
claims
to
be
his
uncle
came
to
rule
over
keretaria
since
then
nox
lowered
his
voice
cautiously
everything
is
different
and
changed
the
people
are
treated
no
better
than
dogs
dogs
repeated
the
royal
ox
bitterly
of
course
this
fellow
can
not
interfere
with
me
nor
take
any
chances
for
there
is
a
prophecy
on
the
west
wall
of
the
castle
that
has
stood
for
a
thousand
years
what
does
it
say
asked
mandy
leaning
forward
and
clasping
the
arms
of
the
rocker
with
all
hands
impressively
nox
repeated
the
prophecy
so
long
as
the
royal
ox
of
keretaria
is
in
good
health
and
spirits
so
long
and
no
longer
shall
the
present
king
rule
over
the
land
but
who
wrote
it
mandy
rocker
stopped
with
a
surprised
squeak
nobody
knows
answered
nox
soberly
but
it
has
come
true
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
each
time
a
new
king
is
crowned
in
keretaria
a
new
ox
appears
mysteriously
at
the
royal
coronation
if
anything
happens
to
the
royal
ox
the
king
also
is
destroyed
my
y
the
goat
girl
now
rocked
very
fast
indeed
so
that
the
reason
they
take
such
good
care
of
you
old
toggins
but
tell
me
where
do
all
of
you
royal
oxen
come
from
in
the
first
place
and
how
is
it
you
can
speak
none
of
the
beasts
on
mount
mern
can
say
a
word
oh
that
the
royal
ox
lifted
his
head
lazily
keretaria
is
in
the
wonderful
land
of
oz
my
dear
handy
and
all
oz
creatures
can
talk
even
the
mice
and
squirrels
but
what
part
of
oz
we
white
oxen
really
come
from
i
myself
can
not
rightly
say
i
seem
to
remember
a
great
blue
forest
and
many
happy
days
there
then
one
evening
a
silver
cloth
was
thrown
over
my
head
and
i
fell
into
a
deep
and
immediate
slumber
when
i
awakened
i
was
here
in
keretaria
and
on
that
same
day
little
king
kerry
was
crowned
king
of
the
realm
from
the
attendants
and
courtiers
i
soon
learned
of
the
strange
prophecy
but
the
young
boy
king
was
so
devoted
to
me
and
i
to
him
i
did
not
miss
the
forest
or
my
former
freedom
to
be
near
me
kerry
had
this
apartment
built
in
the
stable
and
spent
more
than
half
of
his
time
in
my
company
my
life
being
easy
and
pleasant
i
gave
little
thought
to
the
past
or
to
the
future
but
spent
all
my
energies
enjoying
the
present
once
in
a
while
just
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
i
appeared
in
royal
processions
and
each
day
at
sundown
i
was
yoked
for
an
hour
to
the
golden
plough
and
required
to
stand
for
an
hour
in
the
royal
garden
but
i
never
did
any
real
work
or
ploughing
till
you
my
reckless
handy
came
along
today
but
what
about
the
little
king
begged
the
goat
girl
as
nox
lapsed
into
a
thoughtful
silence
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
her
he
disappeared
just
as
i
told
you
the
royal
ox
rolled
his
big
eyes
mournfully
upward
on
this
day
as
on
many
others
i
carried
him
on
my
back
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
there
mounting
his
favorite
steed
he
rode
away
with
the
royal
huntsmen
for
an
hour
sport
as
i
was
returning
to
the
castle
someone
struck
me
a
terrific
blow
that
felled
me
to
the
earth
where
i
lay
for
several
hours
in
complete
unconsciousness
whoever
struck
me
down
evidently
thought
i
was
finished
for
when
i
finally
did
regain
my
senses
i
was
buried
beneath
a
heap
of
loose
earth
and
leaves
still
dazed
and
hardly
knowing
what
i
was
about
i
struggled
out
and
staggered
back
to
the
courtyard
one
of
my
horns
had
been
bent
during
the
encounter
and
my
expression
was
so
wild
and
distracted
no
one
recognized
me
as
boz
the
royal
ox
of
little
king
kerry
the
whole
castle
was
in
an
uproar
for
a
new
king
had
taken
possession
of
the
throne
and
thinking
of
course
i
was
the
next
and
new
royal
ox
this
rascally
imposter
named
me
nox
the
keretarians
without
daring
to
inquire
what
had
become
of
their
former
ruler
crowned
me
with
daisies
and
laurel
and
hurried
to
do
the
bidding
of
their
new
ruler
why
the
big
said
handy
mandy
clenching
all
of
her
fists
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
nothing
has
been
heard
of
the
little
king
since
then
nothing
the
royal
ox
moved
his
head
drearily
from
side
to
side
the
people
think
the
royal
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
again
and
what
can
they
do
a
farmer
boy
brought
word
that
boz
the
royal
ox
had
been
struck
down
and
spirited
away
so
naturally
they
felt
sure
that
kerry
also
had
been
destroyed
or
taken
prisoner
then
no
one
suspects
you
are
really
boz
and
not
nox
questioned
the
goat
girl
now
on
the
very
edge
of
her
chair
oh
my
y
but
do
you
see
if
you
are
still
the
same
ox
who
came
to
keretaria
with
king
kerry
and
you
are
still
all
right
he
must
be
all
right
too
that
is
if
the
prophecy
means
sh
hh
warned
nox
looking
about
nervously
someone
might
hear
you
that
is
what
keeps
me
here
he
went
on
seriously
i
felt
if
i
stayed
quietly
in
my
place
kerry
would
some
day
return
claim
his
own
throne
and
drive
this
miserable
tyrant
out
of
the
country
stay
quietly
here
when
the
little
fellow
may
be
needing
you
cried
handy
aghast
oh
why
do
you
go
look
for
him
you
great
big
ox
you
come
on
what
are
we
waiting
for
why
i
drag
that
old
rascal
off
the
throne
with
my
own
hands
promised
the
goat
girl
indignantly
waving
her
arms
wait
stop
nox
sprang
up
with
surprising
lightness
for
one
usually
so
ponderous
and
slow
do
you
realize
that
i
am
treasured
and
watched
more
closely
than
the
crown
jewels
at
this
very
moment
twenty
guardsmen
stalk
round
and
round
the
stable
i
have
as
much
chance
of
leaving
keretaria
as
a
goldfish
has
of
flying
through
a
forest
as
if
to
prove
his
words
a
tall
soldier
in
a
blue
shako
thrust
his
head
suddenly
through
the
window
from
the
outside
is
everything
in
order
and
as
you
wish
your
highness
puffed
the
guard
looking
suspiciously
at
the
goat
girl
revolving
arms
everything
is
lovely
murmured
the
ox
in
a
sleepy
voice
my
slave
here
is
doing
her
exercises
and
when
she
finishes
she
will
polish
my
horns
at
his
warning
wink
handy
mandy
dropped
all
her
arms
at
her
side
well
well
a
pleasant
evening
to
you
mumbled
the
soldier
withdrawing
his
head
after
another
disapproving
look
at
the
goat
girl
for
a
moment
after
he
had
disappeared
neither
spoke
then
handy
mandy
snatching
a
silk
cover
from
one
of
the
pillows
fell
to
polishing
left
horn
for
very
dear
life
i
can
always
think
faster
when
i
working
she
observed
earnestly
think
away
replied
the
ox
closing
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
numerous
hands
flashing
past
his
nose
but
be
careful
what
you
say
and
do
if
you
rouse
the
suspicions
of
old
king
kerr
you
be
flung
into
a
dungeon
in
spite
of
all
my
influence
now
do
you
be
worrying
about
me
chortled
handy
with
a
little
wink
and
nod
i
been
taking
care
of
myself
and
a
flock
of
goats
for
ten
years
say
this
is
a
bend
for
sure
the
goat
girl
ran
her
rubber
fingers
curiously
along
the
curve
in
the
ox
left
horn
and
then
with
one
of
her
sudden
and
impulses
tried
to
straighten
the
quirk
with
a
quick
twist
of
her
wrist
imagine
then
if
you
can
her
horror
and
surprise
when
the
golden
horn
came
off
in
her
hand
oh
my
goats
and
my
goodness
shuddered
handy
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
what
i
do
where
some
glue
oh
my
igh
igh
mighty
sorry
sorry
gulped
the
royal
ox
glaring
at
the
goat
girl
with
rolling
eyes
and
lashing
tail
but
before
he
could
lunge
forward
as
he
certainly
intended
to
do
handy
gave
a
little
scream
of
excitement
oh
look
she
panted
pointing
all
fingers
at
the
base
of
nox
horn
oh
my
dear
ear
it
screws
on
there
are
regular
grooves
wait
i
have
it
back
in
a
jiffy
nox
who
could
possibly
see
the
top
of
his
own
head
merely
gave
a
grunt
but
handy
mandy
lifting
the
horn
in
her
wooden
hand
screamed
again
and
then
began
to
shake
the
horn
violently
at
her
second
shake
two
silver
balls
tumbled
out
and
rolled
away
into
a
corner
scrambling
after
them
with
nox
now
as
interested
as
she
the
goat
girl
recovered
them
both
and
dropped
breathlessly
on
a
sofa
on
closer
examination
handy
discovered
the
balls
would
open
as
easily
as
cardboard
easter
eggs
and
with
nox
head
resting
heavily
on
her
shoulder
she
gave
the
first
a
quick
turn
it
came
apart
at
once
and
in
the
hollow
center
lay
a
small
folded
paper
spreading
it
out
on
her
knees
handy
read
in
a
hoarse
whisper
go
to
the
silver
mountain
of
oz
silver
mountain
do
you
know
where
that
is
exclaimed
the
goat
girl
looking
wildly
round
at
nox
no
but
i
wager
my
head
it
has
something
to
do
with
kerry
quick
open
the
other
ball
with
the
trembling
fingers
of
her
good
white
hand
the
goat
girl
obeyed
inside
the
second
sphere
lay
a
small
silver
key
after
they
had
examined
this
and
read
the
message
all
over
again
handy
carefully
tucked
the
two
articles
back
in
the
silver
balls
and
returned
the
balls
to
the
golden
horn
then
hastily
screwing
the
horn
back
on
its
base
the
two
began
whispering
earnestly
together
mean
to
say
you
never
knew
your
horn
came
off
questioned
handy
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
of
this
silver
mountain
no
to
both
questions
answered
the
ox
with
an
anxious
little
sigh
but
now
that
we
know
we
must
start
off
at
once
to
search
for
it
and
see
for
ourselves
whether
kerry
is
imprisoned
there
by
his
enemies
though
how
we
escape
these
guards
or
ever
get
away
with
half
the
kingdom
watching
i
can
not
imagine
never
fear
we
manage
promised
handy
easily
why
with
your
horns
and
my
hands
it
will
take
an
army
to
stop
us
now
get
your
rest
ox
dear
and
in
the
morn
morning
we
be
journeying
you
right
breathed
the
ox
starting
obediently
toward
his
stall
i
more
than
half
believe
you
good
night
then
called
the
goat
girl
softly
do
talk
in
your
sleep
and
give
our
plans
away
chapter
out
of
keretaria
nox
was
asleep
on
a
heap
of
white
flower
petals
in
the
corner
of
his
stall
asleep
and
dreaming
of
the
silver
mountain
of
oz
when
a
sharp
tap
on
the
shoulder
rudely
awakened
him
come
whispered
an
urgent
voice
time
to
start
come
i
managed
everything
lurching
to
his
feet
and
still
in
a
daze
the
royal
ox
looked
askance
and
with
no
great
favor
at
the
goat
girl
why
it
not
even
light
he
moaned
feebly
of
course
not
admitted
handy
mandy
guardedly
but
i
poked
my
nose
out
the
door
a
moment
ago
and
saw
all
the
guards
were
a
bit
drowsyish
so
i
tapped
them
on
the
head
with
this
handy
mandy
raised
her
iron
hand
and
with
a
little
grimace
beckoned
for
nox
to
hurry
come
along
now
and
we
can
be
out
of
here
before
they
know
what
what
or
who
so
nox
with
a
regretful
look
round
his
comfortable
stall
and
a
sigh
for
his
morning
bath
and
breakfast
moved
quietly
after
her
while
the
royal
creature
had
spent
most
of
his
time
during
the
past
two
years
thinking
of
ways
to
rescue
his
young
master
now
that
he
was
actually
starting
out
he
was
filled
with
doubt
and
dismay
how
could
they
ever
find
this
silver
mountain
and
overcome
the
enemies
that
most
certainly
would
beset
them
the
sight
of
the
twenty
guards
lying
in
a
stiff
row
somewhat
reassured
the
downhearted
beast
and
in
the
dim
light
of
early
morning
he
looked
thoughtfully
up
at
the
sturdy
mountain
lass
stepping
so
resolutely
beside
him
in
each
hand
handy
carried
a
different
weapon
and
resting
on
her
broad
shoulders
was
a
rake
an
axe
one
guard
gun
another
guard
sword
a
spade
and
a
long
handled
broom
noting
his
astonished
glance
the
goat
girl
grinned
and
with
her
one
free
hand
touched
her
fingers
to
her
lips
so
silently
and
without
exchanging
a
word
the
two
crossed
the
stable
yard
the
royal
park
hurried
through
a
little
wood
and
came
out
on
a
dusty
blue
highway
now
said
handy
looking
up
and
down
the
road
to
make
sure
no
one
was
coming
now
we
can
talk
and
decide
which
direction
to
take
how
can
we
do
that
objected
nox
panting
a
little
from
the
unaccustomed
exertion
before
breakfast
when
neither
of
us
knows
where
this
silver
mountain
is
well
we
have
tongues
have
we
and
can
ask
ca
we
handy
mandy
rattled
her
weapons
impatiently
but
before
we
worry
about
the
silver
mountain
we
must
get
out
of
keretaria
which
is
the
quickest
way
to
the
border
oh
north
answered
nox
promptly
keretaria
is
in
the
upper
part
of
the
munchkin
country
of
oz
and
once
we
cross
the
northern
branch
of
the
munchkin
river
we
be
entirely
out
of
the
country
fine
then
we
go
north
and
what
lies
beyond
the
munchkin
river
inquired
the
goat
girl
shifting
the
axe
to
her
left
shoulder
i
never
crossed
myself
admitted
nox
moving
along
in
his
slow
and
dignified
manner
but
i
have
heard
there
are
many
mountains
and
if
we
go
far
enough
the
purple
land
of
the
gillikins
sounds
interesting
decided
handy
mandy
and
who
knows
among
all
those
mountains
we
may
find
the
one
we
are
looking
for
by
the
way
am
i
to
call
you
boz
nox
or
goldie
horns
but
i
believe
i
call
you
nox
for
somehow
i
like
nox
the
ox
best
anything
you
say
yawned
her
companion
switching
his
tail
negligently
but
i
shall
always
call
you
handy
mandy
it
suits
you
and
you
need
no
longer
consider
yourself
a
slave
ho
ho
i
never
did
roared
the
goat
girl
glancing
cheerfully
down
at
her
lordly
companion
that
was
just
a
joke
was
it
you
know
everything
in
this
land
of
oz
is
extremely
funny
and
peculiar
natives
animals
talking
kings
disappearing
and
mysterious
messages
and
prophecies
people
always
think
a
new
country
strange
observed
the
ox
philosophically
to
us
it
seems
quite
right
and
natural
but
i
daresay
if
i
were
to
find
myself
on
mt
mern
i
consider
everything
there
very
odd
and
upsetting
rocks
flying
through
the
air
for
instance
and
landing
one
soft
and
light
as
a
daisy
in
a
strange
king
garden
but
all
of
our
rocks
do
fly
in
fact
i
never
knew
one
to
do
such
a
thing
before
and
no
wonder
i
landed
as
soft
as
a
daisy
there
was
a
blue
daisy
under
me
or
i
have
been
splintered
to
smithereens
daisy
nox
licked
his
lips
hungrily
you
never
said
anything
about
a
daisy
oh
i
never
tell
all
i
know
confided
handy
especially
to
like
the
king
and
his
counselors
but
there
was
a
daisy
growing
on
the
rock
and
i
picked
it
as
i
started
to
fall
i
began
pulling
off
the
petals
and
when
i
landed
i
came
down
on
a
high
huge
pile
of
them
a
heap
as
high
as
a
haystack
continued
handy
mandy
dreamily
so
i
slid
off
the
stack
and
turned
to
look
at
the
castle
and
when
i
looked
again
the
petals
were
gone
but
there
was
the
daisy
itself
growing
up
as
pert
as
you
please
in
this
strange
garden
so
what
did
i
do
but
pick
it
again
and
here
it
is
triumphantly
handy
pulled
the
blue
flower
from
her
pocket
my
what
a
dear
little
daisy
murmured
the
ox
how
delicious
it
would
taste
no
no
cried
handy
as
nox
rolled
his
long
tongue
out
toward
the
flower
it
too
pretty
to
eat
nothing
too
pretty
to
eat
replied
the
ox
plaintively
funny
it
has
wilted
though
well
i
believe
it
magic
stated
the
goat
girl
with
a
positive
little
shake
of
her
head
as
she
returned
the
daisy
to
her
pocket
handy
felt
the
hard
metal
object
that
had
hit
her
in
the
forehead
when
she
and
nox
ploughed
through
the
king
garden
look
what
do
you
suppose
this
is
she
queried
tapping
the
ox
sharply
on
the
shoulder
for
he
was
walking
sleepily
along
with
his
eyes
closed
this
is
what
we
dug
up
when
we
rushed
through
the
garden
you
know
how
should
i
know
grunted
the
ox
indifferently
opening
one
eye
just
a
silver
hammer
is
it
maybe
we
can
trade
it
for
a
good
breakfast
when
we
cross
the
river
my
y
how
you
talk
scolded
handy
we
not
going
to
trade
it
at
all
see
there
an
initial
on
it
a
big
now
what
would
w
stand
for
who
what
which
where
oh
why
worry
mumbled
the
ox
plodding
resignedly
along
beside
her
well
anyway
it
will
make
a
splendid
potato
masher
concluded
the
goat
girl
returning
the
hammer
to
her
pocket
yes
if
we
had
any
potatoes
the
ox
sighed
heavily
as
he
spoke
looking
off
into
the
distance
with
such
a
mournful
eye
handy
mandy
laughed
a
little
all
to
herself
oh
cheer
up
sniffed
the
goat
girl
you
not
starved
yet
and
hurry
up
too
the
sun
going
higher
every
moment
and
we
better
pass
those
farms
before
the
people
waken
it
was
against
nox
nature
to
hurry
but
realizing
the
wisdom
of
the
goat
girl
advice
he
broke
into
an
awkward
gallop
in
spite
of
his
great
weight
the
royal
creature
was
light
as
a
daisy
on
his
feet
and
except
for
the
faint
rattle
of
handy
weapons
they
made
little
noise
as
they
ran
past
the
blue
houses
and
barns
of
the
munchkin
farmers
could
we
stop
for
a
few
greens
puffed
nox
looking
longingly
over
the
fence
at
a
field
of
cabbages
not
here
dear
ear
red
faced
and
breathless
the
goat
girl
ran
on
wait
till
we
cross
this
river
iver
but
i
not
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
complained
nox
peevishly
running
races
before
breakfast
on
an
empty
stomach
no
bath
no
brush
no
rub
down
well
here
your
brush
gasped
handy
picking
her
way
through
a
dense
thicket
as
the
highway
ended
in
a
small
wood
and
yonder
your
bath
mister
my
y
what
a
blue
river
everything
blue
in
the
munchkin
country
of
oz
nox
told
her
sulkily
as
sharp
briers
and
thorns
reached
out
to
scratch
his
satiny
hide
even
the
royal
ox
of
keretaria
hinted
handy
with
a
sly
wink
oh
the
river
blue
and
the
houses
are
blue
and
even
the
wind
blew
hoo
hoo
come
on
do
try
to
be
funny
with
heaving
sides
the
ox
stopped
on
the
edge
of
the
gleaming
blue
stream
do
try
to
be
funny
i
beg
oh
i
do
have
to
try
i
am
laughed
handy
flinging
the
axe
the
rake
the
spade
the
sword
the
gun
and
the
broomstick
across
the
river
wait
snorted
the
ox
as
handy
having
got
rid
of
her
load
raised
all
of
her
hands
above
her
head
and
prepared
to
dive
in
wait
can
you
swim
i
do
know
but
i
soon
find
out
cried
handy
and
before
nox
could
prevent
it
the
goat
girl
leapt
off
the
bank
and
disappeared
beneath
the
blue
waters
of
the
munchkin
river
for
once
nox
forgot
his
dignity
and
royal
station
and
plunged
frantically
after
his
reckless
companion
swimming
around
with
his
head
under
water
he
finally
located
handy
mandy
and
gripping
her
yellow
plaits
firmly
in
his
teeth
dragged
her
to
the
opposite
bank
the
goat
girl
was
so
full
of
water
she
had
little
to
say
and
lay
soggily
on
the
grass
while
nox
looked
down
at
her
with
mingled
admiration
and
concern
never
do
such
a
thing
again
he
wheezed
severely
as
handy
finally
sat
up
and
began
wringing
the
water
from
her
voluminous
skirts
swimming
is
an
art
and
must
be
learned
and
practiced
but
for
oat
sake
why
did
you
flap
all
those
arms
when
you
hit
the
water
he
finished
irritably
oh
is
that
what
you
supposed
to
do
this
way
before
nox
could
step
a
step
the
goat
girl
had
jumped
into
the
river
again
this
time
instead
of
going
down
she
splashed
and
whirled
her
seven
arms
so
fast
and
furiously
she
just
managed
to
keep
her
head
above
water
but
nox
now
thoroughly
annoyed
and
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
get
far
from
shore
waded
in
and
determinedly
dragged
her
back
to
dry
land
what
in
skyblue
onions
are
you
trying
to
do
he
sputtered
angrily
drown
yourself
no
i
trying
to
swim
coughed
the
goat
girl
struggling
to
get
away
from
the
angry
ox
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
let
this
munchkin
river
get
the
best
of
me
yes
and
while
you
are
swimming
or
rather
practicing
your
swimming
some
of
these
keretarians
will
come
and
capture
us
gurgled
nox
are
we
escaping
or
are
we
swimming
quick
now
make
up
your
mind
nox
earnest
words
brought
handy
quickly
to
her
senses
and
as
the
royal
ox
let
go
her
skirts
she
snatched
up
her
weapons
and
without
waiting
to
wring
out
her
clothes
started
briskly
across
the
meadows
never
mind
you
be
a
fine
swimmer
some
day
said
nox
trotting
more
amiably
beside
her
the
cool
river
water
had
refreshed
the
royal
creature
and
handy
mandy
determination
and
courage
made
him
a
little
ashamed
of
his
own
complaints
takes
a
little
practice
that
all
practice
repeated
handy
dripping
water
from
every
plait
and
pore
well
just
wait
till
we
come
to
the
next
river
i
show
you
but
look
here
are
more
blue
houses
so
we
must
still
be
in
the
munchkin
country
yes
but
we
out
of
keretaria
nox
reminded
her
cheerfully
that
signpost
say
my
girl
hurrying
forward
handy
squinted
up
at
the
rough
board
nailed
to
a
blue
spruce
and
then
began
to
clench
and
unclench
her
one
free
fist
turn
here
directed
the
sign
turn
here
and
go
straight
back
where
you
came
from
well
i
be
buttered
cried
the
goat
girl
throwing
down
every
one
of
her
weapons
i
be
churned
and
buttered
but
what
had
we
butter
do
muttered
the
royal
ox
so
taken
aback
by
the
saucy
message
that
even
his
tongue
was
twisted
why
we
go
straight
on
of
course
declared
handy
mandy
tossing
her
yellow
plaits
defiantly
who
are
whoever
they
are
to
tell
us
our
business
and
recovering
her
weapons
one
by
one
the
goat
girl
tramped
down
the
crooked
lane
directly
ahead
of
them
the
royal
ox
with
lifted
nose
and
horns
stepping
warily
behind
her
chapter
turn
town
determined
as
she
was
handy
found
it
impossible
to
go
straight
on
for
the
lane
curved
and
twisted
this
way
and
that
ending
finally
in
a
perfect
corkscrew
turn
the
trees
on
both
sides
were
now
so
dense
handy
and
the
royal
ox
could
not
have
left
the
road
even
had
they
wished
to
do
so
we
going
round
and
round
and
getting
nowhere
said
nox
in
an
abused
voice
of
all
the
roads
in
oz
why
did
we
have
to
pick
this
one
because
it
dared
us
i
suppose
hi
yi
exclaimed
handy
leaning
against
a
tree
to
rest
i
dizzy
as
a
bat
and
hungry
as
a
goat
too
bad
you
not
a
goat
murmured
nox
who
had
stopped
to
nibble
the
lower
branches
of
a
maple
these
leaves
are
quite
tender
well
i
may
come
to
them
sighed
handy
looking
at
him
enviously
but
shall
we
go
on
i
think
one
more
turn
will
bring
us
out
of
here
handy
was
right
for
one
more
round
brought
them
to
the
end
of
corkscrew
lane
but
only
to
find
themselves
facing
a
high
forbidding
wall
there
was
a
gate
and
turnstile
in
the
wall
and
beyond
the
goat
girl
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
confused
whirling
village
where
everything
seemed
to
be
turning
round
or
over
it
just
because
i
so
dizzy
thought
handy
clutching
her
head
with
her
one
free
hand
but
nox
peering
over
her
shoulder
gave
a
loud
and
indignant
bellow
as
a
house
on
the
corner
of
the
street
nearest
them
turned
completely
over
and
began
spinning
merrily
on
its
chimney
while
the
fence
running
round
the
bakery
shop
next
door
started
really
to
run
around
kicking
up
its
posts
with
great
glee
and
abandon
hu
what
kind
of
silly
place
is
this
rumbled
the
ox
backing
hastily
away
but
handy
mandy
had
seen
a
whole
row
of
little
pies
in
the
bakeshop
window
and
motioning
vigorously
for
nox
to
follow
stepped
over
the
stile
and
through
the
movable
gate
it
was
too
much
of
a
squeeze
for
nox
but
determined
not
to
be
left
behind
he
jumped
neatly
over
a
revolving
sign
on
one
of
the
large
public
buildings
caught
their
attention
at
once
but
as
the
building
was
going
one
way
and
the
sign
another
it
was
several
minutes
before
they
could
discover
what
it
said
turn
town
read
the
goat
girl
in
some
surprise
so
that
where
we
are
and
would
you
loo
ook
every
house
on
every
street
is
going
round
or
over
mercy
ercy
on
us
and
where
do
you
suppose
the
people
are
turning
over
and
over
in
their
beds
i
take
it
it
is
still
quite
early
you
know
whispered
the
royal
ox
speaking
cautiously
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
but
come
on
the
streets
are
not
turning
and
perhaps
if
we
hurry
we
can
go
through
before
they
waken
and
turn
on
us
hurry
hurry
what
are
you
waiting
for
food
sighed
handy
wistfully
i
thought
i
might
catch
us
a
few
pies
old
toggins
here
watch
my
stuff
and
i
bring
us
each
some
nox
looked
sharply
up
and
down
the
street
as
the
goat
girl
set
down
her
axe
rake
spade
gun
broom
and
sword
and
started
off
toward
the
bakery
not
only
the
fence
but
the
shop
itself
was
turning
now
handy
quite
cleverly
waited
till
the
gate
came
opposite
her
and
dashed
through
but
the
open
door
of
the
shop
kept
going
by
so
rapidly
she
was
knocked
down
several
times
before
she
finally
darted
inside
as
she
disappeared
nox
gave
an
uneasy
snort
but
cheered
up
as
the
shop
window
came
past
and
he
saw
handy
with
a
pie
in
every
hand
smile
at
him
reassuringly
but
alas
the
whirling
floor
of
the
shop
was
too
much
for
the
goat
girl
and
as
she
started
out
there
was
a
clatter
of
broken
china
and
falling
furniture
great
gazoo
what
she
done
now
moaned
nox
as
handy
leaped
through
the
door
and
fell
sprawling
in
the
little
garden
she
still
had
six
of
the
pies
clutched
in
her
various
hands
but
as
she
jumped
up
and
raced
through
the
garden
gate
windows
all
up
and
down
the
street
were
flung
open
from
the
right
side
up
ones
and
the
down
side
down
ones
kinky
black
heads
came
popping
out
by
the
hundred
turn
out
turn
out
topsies
turn
out
yelled
the
excited
citizens
their
voices
going
higher
and
higher
thieves
robbers
tramps
and
here
gasped
the
goat
girl
reaching
nox
in
one
bound
eat
these
quick
and
destroy
the
evidence
stuffing
one
of
the
tarts
into
her
own
mouth
handy
made
a
wry
face
ugh
turnips
choked
the
goat
girl
dropping
the
other
five
in
huge
disgust
whoever
heard
of
turnip
turnovers
i
eat
them
offered
nox
lapping
up
the
little
pies
in
his
stride
but
run
hurry
here
come
the
natives
but
before
handy
could
snatch
up
her
weapons
the
topsies
hurling
out
of
windows
and
doors
came
whirling
down
upon
them
startled
though
she
was
the
goat
girl
could
not
disguise
her
interest
and
curiosity
with
one
arm
round
nox
neck
and
the
other
six
stretched
stiffly
before
her
to
keep
back
the
screeching
crowd
she
stared
with
round
and
fascinated
eyes
and
no
wonder
the
topsies
were
about
as
tall
as
children
but
where
their
feet
should
have
been
they
had
sharp
horny
pegs
another
peg
of
the
same
description
sprung
from
each
kinky
head
with
their
plump
hands
the
small
black
and
blue
men
and
women
spun
themselves
along
by
cords
attached
to
their
round
little
middles
and
they
kept
reversing
themselves
spinning
first
on
one
end
and
then
another
in
a
manner
very
upsetting
and
confusing
to
their
visitors
the
hum
made
by
the
topsies
spinning
and
their
loud
raucous
cries
filled
the
early
morning
air
and
as
handy
tried
to
push
her
way
through
the
crowd
several
butted
her
with
their
sharp
pegs
ouch
stop
that
bellowed
nox
who
had
been
butted
too
keep
still
and
sooner
or
later
these
little
pests
will
run
down
turn
them
out
turn
them
in
turn
them
round
turn
them
over
shrieked
the
topsies
hysterically
in
the
midst
of
the
dreadful
confusion
a
topsy
taller
than
all
the
rest
came
zooming
down
the
middle
of
the
street
look
shouted
a
round
little
spinster
waving
both
arms
travelers
with
legs
instead
of
pegs
robbers
thieves
and
tramps
your
topjesty
yes
and
they
have
broken
into
my
shop
and
stolen
all
my
turnip
turnovers
screamed
the
topsy
baker
spinning
round
in
indignant
circles
aha
you
wait
here
comes
now
you
catch
it
you
you
turnover
snatchers
you
now
you
catch
it
shrilled
all
the
rest
of
the
topsies
spinning
faster
and
faster
till
handy
and
nox
were
dizzy
just
from
looking
at
them
except
for
his
size
and
a
flag
fluttering
from
the
peg
on
his
head
looked
just
like
his
subjects
spin
spin
he
whistled
angrily
what
do
you
mean
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
turn
town
do
you
realize
you
are
breaking
every
one
of
our
rotary
laws
why
are
you
here
did
you
come
to
do
us
a
good
turn
or
a
bad
turn
down
turn
out
turn
over
turn
round
insisted
the
townsmen
shrilly
between
the
revolving
houses
and
the
spinning
topsies
handy
mandy
scarcely
knew
which
foot
she
was
standing
on
as
for
nox
he
gave
a
great
groan
and
closing
his
eyes
left
everything
to
his
companion
handy
put
two
hands
over
her
ears
and
raising
all
the
others
addressed
in
a
firm
and
reasonable
manner
tell
your
people
to
stand
back
directed
the
goat
girl
calmly
all
we
wish
is
to
pass
quietly
through
your
city
and
never
return
never
she
repeated
emphatically
it
was
hard
to
speak
to
a
person
who
kept
going
round
and
round
but
at
every
third
turn
handy
managed
to
catch
eye
and
at
last
he
seemed
to
catch
her
idea
very
well
then
go
he
commanded
haughtily
and
at
once
but
when
handy
without
stopping
to
pick
up
her
weapons
started
forward
perfect
shrieks
of
anger
rose
on
all
sides
not
that
way
not
that
way
turn
turn
turn
yelled
the
topsies
and
getting
back
of
handy
and
the
royal
ox
they
tried
to
push
them
round
by
main
force
stop
stop
it
no
use
panted
as
nox
letting
out
a
frightful
bellow
laid
seven
topsies
by
the
pegs
with
his
left
hind
foot
and
handy
with
a
sweep
of
her
arms
swept
down
ten
more
all
made
wrong
fetch
the
turn
coat
drive
them
to
the
turning
point
and
we
turn
them
to
topsies
in
two
shakes
of
a
tent
pole
m
mmmmm
m
mmmmm
did
you
hear
what
i
heard
nox
peered
desperately
around
at
handy
who
was
now
spinning
dizzily
herself
as
she
was
flung
and
pushed
from
one
group
to
another
could
they
really
turn
us
to
topsies
i
do
know
i
do
know
oh
my
head
my
head
moaned
the
goat
girl
clutching
it
with
all
hands
it
going
round
and
round
fine
fine
that
the
way
cheered
the
topsies
heartily
you
be
spinning
circles
before
you
know
it
and
have
beautiful
wool
like
the
rest
of
us
wool
gasped
handy
who
was
extremely
proud
of
her
shining
yellow
braids
oh

wool

that
just
too
much
stand
back
you
little
buzzards
and
i
show

turn
uppins
who
seemed
next
in
importance
to
himself
it
your
turn
anyway
stand
back
topsies
and
let
this
waddling
whangus
show
us
what
she
can
do
at
a
signal
from
their
leader
the
turn
towners
fell
back
a
pace
and
spinning
in
a
loud
agitated
circle
impatiently
waited
for
the
goat
girl
to
take
her
turn
first
handy
shook
her
head
to
dispel
the
dizziness
then
with
a
loud
screech
she
flung
her
arms
and
heels
into
the
air
in
such
a
succession
of
hand
springs
that
even
the
topsies
were
impressed
the
seventh
brought
her
back
to
the
royal
ox
and
in
the
center
of
a
now
cheering
and
admiring
circle
she
turned
fifty
more
so
fast
that
she
looked
like
an
animated
cartwheel
with
arms
and
leg
for
spokes
a
loud
buzz
of
applause
went
up
as
handy
finally
fell
over
from
sheer
exhaustion
but
then
they
began
pointing
accusing
fingers
at
nox
look
look
at
the
stupid
gumflumox
why
he
has
turned
a
single
hair
how
about
turning
on
them
raged
nox
and
tossing
a
few
dozen
on
my
horns
hop
on
my
back
and
we
make
a
run
for
it
no
no
there
are
too
many
we
be
perfectly
punctured
worried
handy
as
seven
topsies
prodded
the
royal
ox
sharply
in
the
flank
we
might
run
right
into
that
turning
point
too
wait
wait
i
think
of
something
we
do
want
to
spin
on
here
forever
whatever
happens
whew
hewey
what
a
dust
the
little
pests
kick
up
i
give
my
best
hand
for
a
drink
i
choking
with
thirst
oh
oh
i
wish
i
were
in
a
river
right
this
minute
steadying
herself
by
holding
to
nox
right
horn
handy
faced
the
angry
multitude
turn
turn
take
your
turn
shouted
the
topsies
incessantly
you
even
turn
your
head
old
of
course
he
can
shouted
handy
mandy
clapping
six
of
her
hands
for
silence
not
only
his
head
but
his
horns
watch
this
my
friends
the
goat
girl
gave
the
horn
she
was
leaning
on
a
sharp
twist
not
that
one
not
that
one
fumed
the
ox
anxiously
quick
the
other
it
the
other
one
i
tell
you
oh
my
hide
hair
and
heavens
ulp
gurgle
ooooop
and
oooop
gurgle
ulp
it
was
with
everyone
for
at
handy
second
turn
nox
horn
came
completely
off
and
as
the
goat
girl
held
it
up
for
the
topsies
to
see
out
spurted
a
perfect
torrent
of
water
that
flooded
the
whole
city
till
every
turner
and
house
in
it
was
awash
or
afloat
in
wild
and
astonished
voices
the
kinky
headed
little
citizens
called
out
to
each
other
as
they
bobbed
up
and
down
like
corks
on
the
raging
tide
and
just
as
wet
and
surprised
as
the
topsies
the
goat
girl
and
nox
were
swept
along
by
the
impetuous
flood
chapter
a
horn
of
plenty
after
the
first
awful
ducking
handy
without
losing
a
second
began
to
practice
her
swimming
striking
out
with
strength
and
purpose
and
her
seven
good
arms
she
managed
to
keep
abreast
of
nox
who
was
moving
easily
along
in
the
center
of
the
torrent
bothersome
as
the
topsies
had
been
the
goat
girl
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
the
little
turn
towners
at
first
she
feared
they
would
all
go
down
but
they
just
spun
round
like
water
bugs
on
the
surface
and
while
they
made
no
progress
seemed
in
little
danger
of
drowning
in
fact
they
could
no
more
sink
than
corks
or
kindling
so
busy
with
her
own
struggles
handy
dismissed
them
from
her
mind
and
tried
to
figure
out
the
reason
for
the
sudden
and
overwhelming
rush
of
water
that
had
deluged
the
city
at
any
rate
it
was
fine
to
be
rid
of
the
topsies
she
reflected
philosophically
and
when
the
flood
did
recede
turn
town
would
be
good
as
new
and
twice
as
clean
the
current
was
racing
along
so
swiftly
now
the
last
topsy
had
long
since
disappeared
leaving
only
herself
and
nox
in
the
broad
tumbling
expanse
of
water
nox
had
not
uttered
a
word
since
his
first
outcry
when
the
flood
had
overtaken
them
but
he
looked
so
glum
and
disagreeable
that
handy
thrashing
along
beside
him
wondered
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
start
a
conversation
as
it
happened
the
royal
beast
saved
her
the
trouble
by
starting
one
himself
well
he
snorted
bitterly
i
see
you
still
have
it
what
gulped
the
goat
girl
forgetting
to
use
her
arms
for
a
moment
and
in
consequence
shipping
about
a
bucket
of
water
ulp
gulp
have
what
my
horn
horn
gurgled
nox
glaring
at
her
angrily
over
a
wave
and
if
in
the
future
you
will
keep
your
hands
all
of
them
off
my
horns
it
will
be
the
better
for
us
this
seemed
to
handy
a
very
unjust
and
unreasonable
attitude
for
nox
to
take
but
she
was
too
occupied
keeping
afloat
to
stop
and
argue
the
matter
swim
closer
and
i
screw
it
back
she
offered
obligingly
holding
up
the
wooden
hand
in
which
she
still
clutched
the
right
half
of
the
royal
headgear
but
at
this
poor
nox
was
deluged
by
a
robust
stream
that
still
poured
from
the
golden
horn
hastily
plunging
it
under
the
surface
again
handy
watched
her
fellow
adventurer
emerge
sputtering
and
furious
from
the
depths
well
of
all
the
stupid
tricks
gasped
the
ox
swimming
rapidly
away
from
her
stop
keep
off
do
you
dare
come
near
me
but
see
here
panted
handy
going
after
him
in
real
exasperation
after
all
it
is
your
horn
and
am
i
to
blame
if
there
is
a
river
inside
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
throw
it
away
no
no
bellowed
the
ox
stopping
short
and
looking
frantically
over
his
shoulder
if
you
throw
it
away
i
look
like
a
fool
if
you
keep
holding
it
we
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
swimming
round
in
this
torrent
if
you
screw
it
back
on
my
head
it
will
probably
give
me
water
on
the
brain
oh
blub
glub
what
shall
we
do
think
of
something
ca
you
before
we
both
drown
in
your
stupid
old
river
my
river
handy
mandy
was
so
indignant
that
for
a
moment
she
was
perfectly
speechless
yes
your
river
roared
nox
treading
water
angrily
did
you
wish
for
a
river
just
before
you
jerked
off
my
horn
well
this
is
it
and
i
hope
you
like
it
why
nox
how
clever
of
you
to
guess
bubbled
the
goat
girl
a
great
light
breaking
over
her
wet
head
i
remember
now
i
was
thirsty
and
wished
for
a
drink
then
a
whole
river
and
lo
a
river
was
here
you
mean
high
it
was
here
raged
nox
beginning
to
swim
again
but
look
cried
handy
beating
and
slapping
the
water
exultantly
with
her
many
hands
if
that
is
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
wish
it
away
again
i
still
holding
the
horn
and
there
magic
in
it
old
toddywax
magic
i
here
and
now
wish
this
river
away
handy
yelled
her
wish
in
a
booming
voice
that
almost
split
the
and
both
were
so
sure
the
wish
would
be
granted
they
stopped
swimming
so
both
had
a
fine
ducking
as
the
river
continued
to
rush
merrily
and
unconcernedly
over
their
heads
bosh
it
was
magic
after
all
my
y
if
i
ever
get
out
of
here
i
never
go
swimming
again
as
long
as
i
live
sobbed
handy
pushing
her
arms
and
legs
wearily
through
the
water
oh
i
think
i
just
sink
and
be
done
with
it
moaned
the
ox
churning
breathlessly
along
beside
her
you
think
you
sink
exclaimed
handy
popping
her
head
up
indignantly
do
you
dare
sink
and
leave
me
here
all
alone
besides
we
set
out
to
find
that
little
king
and
we
going
to
find
him
where
your
sporting
blood
watered
gurgled
the
royal
ox
in
a
faint
voice
goodbye
you
probably
did
it
all
for
the
best
it
seemed
to
the
goat
girl
that
nox
was
really
sinking
so
flinging
out
her
leather
hand
she
grasped
him
firmly
by
his
left
horn
then
acting
quickly
and
before
he
could
object
handy
pushed
his
head
under
water
and
quickly
screwed
his
right
horn
in
place
i
wish
this
dumb
river
would
go
straight
back
where
it
came
from
quavered
handy
as
nox
bellowing
and
bubbling
backed
indignantly
away
and
this
time
the
river
went
so
suddenly
and
completely
the
goat
girl
and
the
ox
were
dropped
forty
feet
to
the
bottom
of
a
rocky
gorge
through
which
the
torrent
had
been
tumbling
for
a
long
moment
they
lay
where
they
had
fallen
then
stiffly
they
arose
and
peered
anxiously
around
them
handy
thanks
to
her
voluminous
petticoats
was
saved
from
serious
injury
and
nox
who
had
landed
in
a
patch
of
brush
was
not
dangerously
hurt
either
but
they
both
were
so
shocked
shaken
and
worn
out
from
their
long
swim
they
were
perfectly
content
to
stay
where
they
were
you
see
sighed
handy
wringing
out
her
skirts
with
four
hands
and
smoothing
back
her
hair
with
the
other
three
the
magic
is
in
the
horn
and
only
works
when
you
are
wearing
it
as
soon
as
i
screwed
it
back
and
made
the
wish
everything
was
all
right
oh
was
it
scowling
round
at
his
scratched
flanks
and
skinned
shins
the
royal
ox
shook
his
head
dubiously
and
just
think
continued
the
goat
girl
brightly
if
your
horn
really
is
a
wishing
horn
as
soon
as
we
decide
where
we
want
to
go
all
we
have
to
do
is
wish
ourselves
there
no
no
absolutely
no
more
of
that
squealed
nox
lashing
his
tail
and
flashing
his
eyes
dangerously
your
last
wish
nearly
killed
me
and
if
any
more
wishing
is
to
be
done
i
attend
to
it
myself
but
how
can
you
unscrew
or
even
touch
your
own
horn
all
by
yourself
inquired
handy
reasonably
you
see
you
need
my
hands
and
i
need
your
horns
throwing
back
her
head
handy
burst
into
a
loud
chuckle
thinking
how
comical
she
would
look
if
she
actually
wore
nox
golden
headgear
oh
why
not
go
on
the
way
we
started
said
the
ox
querulously
rather
travel
on
my
feet
than
my
horns
any
day
and
had
you
noticed
handy
that
these
rocks
are
purple
your
river
has
carried
us
clear
into
the
gillikin
country
where
there
are
mountains
galore
and
even
a
silver
one
for
all
we
know
yes
but
is
there
anything
to
eat
asked
the
goat
girl
in
a
hollow
voice
if
those
rude
little
topsies
had
just
given
us
some
breakfast
i
expect
all
they
eat
is
spinach
or
turnips
sniffed
nox
and
you
would
not
have
cared
for
either
well
at
any
rate
we
even
you
certainly
turned
the
tide
on
them
nox
who
was
beginning
to
feel
more
cheerful
began
to
shake
all
over
i
wager
my
tail
they
be
more
polite
to
travellers
in
the
future
well
as
it
all
turned
out
so
well
let
make
another
wish
proposed
handy
mandy
practically
let
wish
ourselves
out
of
here
no
use
scrambling
over
all
these
rocks
when
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
wish
ourselves
to
the
spot
where
your
little
king
happens
to
be
mused
nox
half
closing
his
eyes
nothing
is
as
easy
as
that
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
neither
can
i
said
handy
and
stepping
briskly
up
to
the
royal
ox
she
gave
his
right
horn
a
determined
twist
at
the
same
time
saying
softly
i
wish
myself
and
nox
with
kerry
the
rightful
ruler
of
keretaria
nox
twitched
his
ears
nervously
as
his
horn
came
off
in
the
goat
girl
best
white
hand
and
handy
herself
with
all
her
arms
outspread
as
if
she
were
a
bird
about
to
take
flight
waited
in
rapturous
expectation
for
her
wish
to
take
effect
but
this
time
nothing
at
all
happened
neither
she
nor
the
ox
moved
an
inch
there
you
are
i
told
you
it
would
work
grumbled
nox
looking
at
her
crossly
it
probably
not
magic
at
all
oh
yes
it
is
insisted
handy
screwing
up
her
eye
and
peering
down
into
the
hollow
interior
it
gave
us
a
river
when
we
asked
for
it
and
you
ca
get
away
from
that
we
certainly
had
a
hard
enough
time
getting
away
from
it
agreed
her
companion
come
now
be
a
good
girl
screw
back
that
horn
and
let
be
starting
on
but
i
just
can
not
understand
why
it
grants
some
wishes
and
not
others
muttered
handy
discontentedly
when
i
was
thirsty
and
wished
for
a
river
i
got
a
river
i
have
it
this
horn
gives
you
things
but
does
not
take
you
places
now
let
see
what
do
we
need
the
most
breakfast
suggested
the
ox
in
an
interested
voice
oats
and
apples
for
me
eggs
rolls
and
coffee
for
you
but
for
goat
sake
be
careful
how
you
wish
we
do
want
too
much
even
of
a
good
thing
and
one
can
drown
in
coffee
or
smother
in
oats
remember
the
river
and
be
exact
as
to
size
and
quantity
my
y
this
wishing
is
dreadfully
complicated
rubbing
her
forehead
with
one
hand
after
the
other
handy
mandy
prepared
to
order
breakfast
first
she
screwed
the
right
horn
back
on
the
head
of
the
ox
then
pursing
her
lips
firmly
she
spoke
i
wish
for
nox
two
measures
of
oats
and
apples
for
myself
two
plates
of
eggs
and
rolls
and
one
cup
of
coffee
turning
the
horn
round
till
it
came
off
once
more
the
goat
girl
almost
held
her
breath
as
the
two
breakfasts
were
set
promptly
and
noiselessly
down
on
the
rock
at
her
feet
now
you
getting
the
idea
happily
nox
advanced
upon
his
breakfast
say
is
this
simply
manubious
cried
handy
snapping
her
fingers
for
sheer
joy
why
nox
your
horn
is
a
real
horn
of
plenty
and
plenty
of
trouble
if
you
do
watch
your
wishes
mumbled
her
partner
already
up
to
his
ears
in
oats
oh
i
be
careful
never
fear
promised
handy
screwing
the
horn
back
on
its
base
and
falling
upon
her
breakfast
with
a
right
good
will
and
appetite
wo
the
eyes
of
the
villagers
at
home
stick
out
when
i
tell
them
about
this
yes
provided
you
ever
get
home
observed
the
ox
who
seemed
always
to
take
a
dark
view
of
the
future
but
handy
mandy
popping
the
last
of
the
biscuits
into
her
mouth
scarcely
heard
him
now
that
they
need
no
longer
worry
about
provisions
for
the
journey
she
felt
that
they
would
safely
reach
the
silver
mountain
wherever
it
might
be
rescue
the
little
king
from
his
enemies
and
restore
him
to
his
throne
then
after
seeing
all
she
wished
of
the
marvelous
country
of
oz
she
would
return
to

startle
the
country

along
she
called
gaily
let
climb
out
of
here
with
some
astonishment
they
watched
the
empty
containers
and
dishes
vanish
away
and
then
saying
very
little
but
thinking
a
great
deal
the
two
adventurers
began
to
scramble
up
the
rocky
sides
of
the
gorge

learns
about

handy
who
had
climbed
up
and
down
mountains
all
her
life
reached
the
top
of
the
gorge
first
and
with
her
various
hands
tugged
nox
up
the
last
steep
incline
so
this
is
the
gillikin

panted
the
goat
girl
staring
away
over
the
heather
covered
highlands
now
about
the
natives
do
they
spin
bounce
or
tumble
that
i
really
could
say
gasped
nox
leaning
against
a
tree
to
regain
his
wind
but
as
you
can
see
my
girl
all
the
hills
trees
and
vegetation
shade
from
violet
to
purple
lovely
color

i
suppose
purple
would
appeal
to
a
royal

like
you
resting
her
hands
on
her
hips
handy
mandy
squinted
critically
about
her
now
as
for
me
i
prefer
the
more
cheerful
colors
red
yellow
or
green
for
instance
then
you
like
the
quadling

winkie

the

have
all
color
countries
in
oz
and
a
body
can
take
his
choice
oh
we
just
take
them
as
they
come
decided
the
goat
girl
sensibly
or
at
least
till
we
find
your
young
master

this

tell
me
nox
is
each

you

lifting
his
forefoot
complacently
and
what
have
you
four
triangles
answered
the
goat
girl
promptly
put
a
circle
in
the
center
where
all
the
triangles
meet
nox
fairly
radiated
pride
and
importance
as
his
geozophy
lesson
progressed
then
what
demanded
handy
the
stick
upraised
in
her
rubber
hand
that
all
tossing
back
his
horns
the
ox
surveyed
his
pupil
triumphantly
simple
is
it
that
triangle
on
the
west
is
the
blue
munchkin
country
we
have
just
left
the
triangle
to
the
north
is
the
purple
gillikin
country
we
are
just
entering
over
there
on
the
east
we
have
the
yellow
empire
of
the
winkies
and
to
the
south
the
red
lands
of
the
quadlings
in
the
circle
is
the
emerald
city
of
oz
and
surrounding
the
whole
kingdom
is
a
deadly
desert
of
burning
sand
my
y
marveled
the
goat
girl
clasping
all
her
hands
but
one
behind
her
back
the
desert
i
crossed
when
i
fell
in
keretaria
of
course
answered
nox
snapping
lazily
at
a
purple
dragon
fly
mt
mern
must
lie
to
the
west
of
oz
on
the
other
side
of
the
deadly
desert
there
are
many
countries
beyond
the
desert
but
i
know
very
little
about
them
as
there
are
only
oz
maps
in
the
castle
at
home
then
i
suppose
the
king
of
keretaria
is
king
of
the
munchkins
said
handy
looking
thoughtfully
down
at
her
map
oh
my
no
the
royal
ox
positively
chuckled
at
such
an
idea
keretaria
is
just
one
of
the
small
countries
of
the
west
cheeriobed
is
king
of
the
munchkins
and
he
lives
in
the
sapphire
city
seventy
leagues
below
our
southernmost
borderline
glinda
the
good
sorceress
rules
all
the
small
kingdoms
in
the
quadling
country
the
tin
woodman
of
oz
is
emperor
of
the
winkies
and
jo
king
governs
the
gillikins
besides
these
there
are
kings
queens
and
princes
galore
but
most
important
of
all
is
ozma
the
young
fairy
who
lives
in
the
emerald
city
for
ozma
is
supreme
sovereign
of
the
entire
kingdom
of
oz
dear
ear
what
a
lot
to
remember
groaned
the
goat
girl
and
all
these
other
kings
and
queens
have
to
do
what
ozma
says
however
does
she
keep
track
of
them
all
i
bet
they
worse
than
a
flock
of
goats
oh
she
manages
said
the
ox
beginning
to
move
slowly
forward
being
a
fairy
and
having
a
wizard
right
in
her
own
castle
ozma
knows
what
is
going
on
without
even
turning
her
head
even
where
we
are
going
exclaimed
handy
mandy
indignantly
hi
yi
what
a
little
i
just
know
i
wo
like
her
well
in
that
case
she
will
just
have
to
give
up
her
throne
and
throw
her
crown
out
of
the
window
i
suppose
better
have
a
care
you
speaking
of
a
powerful
fairy
you
know
nox
looked
so
stern
as
he
went
plowing
through
the
heather
handy
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
herself
but
how
could
a
fairy
in
the
center
of
oz
see
way
off
here
she
demanded
scornfully
magic
that
how
explained
nox
looking
very
calm
and
superior
in
her
castle
ozma
has
a
magic
picture
that
shows
her
everything
she
wishes
to
see
i
do
believe
it
scoffed
the
goat
girl
swinging
all
her
arms
recklessly
and
besides
why
would
she
wish
to
see
us
and
this
particular
piece
of
country
at
this
particular
minute
i
sure
i
do
know
said
the
royal
ox
haughtily
but
i
do
say
be
careful
there
what
did
i
tell
you
framed
in
the
woodwork
of
a
small
they
were
approaching
was
a
large
poster
you
are
now
in
the
land
of
oz
stated
the
poster
pleasantly
enough
be
good
to
us
and
we
be
good
to
you
keep
our
laws
and
practice
no
magic
either
for
good
or
evil
by
order
of
her
imperial
highness
queen
ozma
of
oz
below
was
the
bright
green
seal
of
oz
and
a
picture
of
its
pretty
dark
haired
ruler
why
she
nothing
but
a
little
girl
cried
handy
positively
aghast
at
such
a
state
of
affairs
how
could
a
little
mite
like
that
rule
a
whole
country
and
be
so
bossy
oh
hush
begged
nox
rolling
his
eyes
anxiously
mite
or
not
ozma
is
a
mighty
powerful
and
important
fairy
well
we
pretty
important
ourselves
sniffed
the
goat
girl
squinting
at
the
poster
with
all
her
arms
akimbo
and
besides
handy
lifted
her
chin
defiantly
we
broken
the
law
already
when
we
used
your
gold
horn
of
plenty
no
magic
hoh
what
does
she
expect
us
to
do
with
good
magic
right
at
hand
starve
but
ho
ho
we
can
get
around
that
old
toggins
after
all
we
are
not
practicing
magic
we
do
have
to
practice
it
our
magic
is
perfect
so
put
that
in
your
pipe
and
smoke
it
miss
ozma
to
bozma
snatching
up
a
rock
in
each
of
her
seven
hands
handy
flung
them
hilariously
over
a
clump
of
prune
trees
yes
prunes
already
wrinkled
grow
in
the
land
of
oz
there
was
an
uncomfortable
little
silence
after
handy
rash
outburst
then
a
perfect
tempest
of
shrieks
and
screeches
now
see
what
you
done
gulped
the
ox
switching
his
tail
nervously
quick
quick
jump
on
my
back
and
we
rush
by
these
chaps
look
dangerous
why
they
have
hook
noses
sputtered
handy
too
startled
to
move
as
a
band
of
kilted
highlanders
came
racing
down
toward
them
the
noses
of
these
singular
were
long
and
thin
curving
out
and
up
far
above
their
foreheads
on
these
hooks
hung
dangerous
looking
rings
almost
as
large
as
barrel
hoops
while
handy
was
wondering
what
they
could
be
for
the
nearest
hooker
pulled
a
ring
from
his
nose
and
flung
it
with
all
his
might
at
her
head
up
up
bellowed
nox
pawing
the
ground
in
his
agitation
are
you
going
to
stand
there
till
you
are
pegged
like
a
top
the
iron
ring
missed
handy
by
mere
inches
and
grasping
nox
horn
she
pulled
herself
to
his
back
there
were
about
sixty
of
the
hook
noses
and
swinging
to
the
left
nox
tried
to
skirt
the
tribe
but
they
were
too
quick
for
him
and
spreading
out
in
a
long
line
they
began
hurling
their
wicked
whizzing
weapons
one
caught
neatly
on
the
horn
of
the
royal
ox
another
hit
handy
a
horrid
blow
on
the
knee
and
as
nox
snorting
and
furious
turned
to
run
a
dozen
more
came
whanging
down
about
their
ears
dodging
left
and
right
handy
mandy
leaned
forward
and
began
to
unscrew
nox
right
horn
good
to
us
and
we
be
good
to
you
hoh
like
fun
you
will
muttered
the
goat
girl
catching
six
of
the
flying
missiles
in
her
clever
hands
and
tossing
them
back
with
all
her
might
take
that
and
these
and
them
and
those
pulling
off
the
ox
horn
with
the
only
hand
she
had
left
she
added
desperately
i
wish
a
barrel
of
molasses
over
the
head
of
each
hook
nose
in
this
band
cats
bats
and
billy
goats
they
got
me
and
they
had
too
for
just
as
handy
finished
her
wish
down
flashed
an
iron
ring
pinioning
her
arms
tightly
to
her
sides
still
grasping
the
precious
horn
handy
dug
her
heels
into
nox
hurt
grunted
the
ox
leaping
forward
not
hurt
just
hooked
and
humiliated
ca
move
a
muscle
raged
the
goat
girl
but
ha
ha
neither
can
they
look
nox
who
had
been
bellowing
too
hard
to
hear
handy
wish
or
miss
his
horn
glanced
back
hurriedly
why
what
come
over
them
he
wheezed
in
astonishment
who
snuffed
them
out
with
barrels
and
what
that
sticky
fluid
running
all
around
molasses
handy
told
him
with
extreme
satisfaction
as
she
tried
vainly
to
wriggle
out
of
her
ring
i
wished
barrels
of
molasses
on
their
heads
and
we
better
dash
on
while
they
stopped
and
stuck
with
it
then
you
been
breaking
the
law
again
reproached
nox
dodging
in
and
out
and
around
their
frantic
enemies
well
as
between
broken
heads
and
broken
laws
i
choose
the
laws
besides
look
what
they
did
to
me
exclaimed
the
goat
girl
indignantly
i
may
never
get
this
hoop
off
or
be
able
to
lift
a
hand
again
nice
people
you
have
in
oz
i
must
say
if
you
had
hit
them
with
stones
they
would
have
hit
us
with
hoops
nox
reminded
her
sternly
at
the
same
time
breaking
into
a
gallop
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
himself
and
the
troublesome
gillikins
a
few
had
managed
to
lift
the
barrels
from
their
heads
but
most
of
them
were
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
ground
half
choked
with
rage
and
molasses
when
we
stop
i
think
i
can
help
you
promised
nox
looking
anxiously
at
handy
who
was
now
quite
purple
in
the
face
from
her
struggles
with
the
hoop
just
forget
it
ca
you
and
think
of
the
interesting
people
we
are
meeting
i
wager
you
have
no
hook
noses
on
mt
mern
i
should
say
not
sputtered
the
goat
girl
in
disgust
and
then
realizing
she
was
making
no
progress
with
the
ring
sensibly
gave
up
the
attempt
to
free
herself
somewhat
comforted
by
the
thought
that
the
hook
noses
were
probably
as
uncomfortable
as
she
was
handy
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
natives
if
they
ran
into
any
more
she
wanted
to
be
sure
of
seeing
them
first
but
the
rocky
hills
and
glades
were
entirely
deserted
and
at
every
step
the
way
became
more
mountainous
and
lonely
nox
panting
and
wheezing
from
the
long
pull
slackened
his
pace
to
a
walk
handy
mandy
with
some
difficulty
managed
to
dismount
and
the
ox
slipping
his
horn
under
the
offending
ring
gently
forced
it
upward
till
the
goat
girl
was
able
to
wiggle
free
then
together
they
climbed
up
the
flinty
inclines
up
and
up
till
they
came
to
a
wide
ledge
and
a
sparkling
waterfall
here
they
had
a
drink
without
having
to
wish
for
one
nox
sticking
his
head
right
into
the
water
and
handy
cupping
three
pairs
of
her
hands
to
hold
enough
to
satisfy
her
thirst
ho
hum
sighed
the
ox
i
wonder
how
much
farther
we
have
to
go
before
we
can
find
anyone
who
can
direct
us
to
this
silver
mountain
i
sure
i
saw
some
castles
when
we
were
below
so
did
i
said
handy
screwing
his
right
horn
back
with
a
businesslike
flourish
my
y
seems
a
long
time
since
we
started
from
keretaria
do
you
suppose
they
have
missed
us
yet
probably
yawned
the
ox
scratching
his
back
against
a
rock
while
handy
suddenly
deciding
she
needed
another
drink
stepped
close
to
the
waterfall
but
instead
of
quenching
her
thirst
the
goat
girl
spilled
water
all
over
her
feet
nox
nox
she
screamed
jerking
all
her
thumbs
in
his
direction
come
look
here
there
a
big
hollow
behind
this
waterfall
a
high
wall
of
rock
with
a
door
in
it
i
can
see
it
well
sniffed
the
ox
rubbing
his
back
luxuriously
does
it
say
in
must
we
try
every
door
we
come
to
yes
handy
mandy
told
him
firmly
we
must
where
there
a
door
there
bound
to
be
a
or
at
least
someone
who
might
tell
us
where
we
are
now
then
i
jump
through
the
waterfall
first
and
knock
on
the
door
there
would
be
room
for
you
on
the
ledge
until
the
door
is
open
sounds
risky
objected
the
royal
ox
putting
back
his
ears
what
kind
of
people
would
live
behind
a
waterfall
ask
yourself
that
but
the
goat
girl
without
stopping
to
ask
herself
anything
had
already
plunged
through
the
misty
sheet
of
water
and
gasping
and
spluttering
was
hammering
on
the
door
with
all
seven
of
her
fists
chapter
the
magic
hammer
there
was
no
answer
to
handy
loud
knocks
and
pausing
to
catch
her
breath
and
blow
on
her
fingers
the
goat
girl
wondered
what
to
try
next
then
in
spite
of
nox
warning
bellow
she
began
to
shove
and
push
the
wet
planks
with
her
shoulder
but
that
did
no
good
either
so
she
felt
in
her
pocket
for
something
to
use
as
a
wedge
almost
at
once
her
fingers
closed
on
the
silver
hammer
they
had
ploughed
up
in
keretaria
while
the
hammer
would
not
do
for
a
wedge
it
would
at
least
save
her
knuckles
so
lifting
it
high
above
her
head
handy
mandy
brought
it
down
with
a
resounding
whack
a
shower
of
silver
sparks
followed
the
hammer
blow
and
nox
peering
through
the
waterfall
saw
a
gnarled
and
crooked
elf
with
a
purple
beard
dancing
madly
round
the
startled
girl
am
the
elf
of
the
hammer
who
must
do
whatever
you
ask
me
sang
the
elf
between
his
high
leaps
and
prances
then
open
this
door
directed
handy
spinning
round
in
a
circle
herself
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
little
fellow
my
y
how
funny
oz
is
magic
horns
topsies
hook
noses
and
now
do
tell
me
a
little
body
like
you
can
really
open
this
great
heavy
door
up
the
hammer
and
doubt
no
more
himself
the
elf
will
now
open
the
in
a
daze
handy
mandy
picked
up
the
hammer
and
put
it
back
in
her
pocket
and
nox
thunderstruck
by
the
whole
proceeding
thrust
his
head
through
the
waterfall
just
in
time
to
see
the
knobby
little
gnome
push
the
door
open
with
one
thump
of
his
brown
fist
quick
as
a
flash
handy
was
on
the
other
side
come
on
come
on
she
called
hoarsely
to
nox
ca
you
see
closing
oh
mercy
ercy
do
you
want
to
leave
me
here
all
alone
yes
snorted
nox
in
an
exasperated
voice
but
jumping
as
he
snorted
i
like
nothing
better
as
he
came
to
he
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
waterfall
and
skidded
through
the
open
door
into
the
mountain
he
had
just
time
to
tuck
in
his
tail
when
the
door
with
an
ominous
creak
slammed
shut
see
what
you
done
gasped
nox
eyeing
the
gloomy
interior
with
distaste
and
foreboding
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
a
help
to
me
and
all
puff
splutter
you
do
is
get
me
into
trouble
what
sort
of
place
is
this
anyway
a
quavered
handy
wrapping
all
her
arms
tightly
round
herself
my
y
it
so
high
igh
i
can
hardly
see
the
top
that
elf
gone
sighed
the
ox
taking
a
cautious
step
forward
but
i
expect
he
come
back
at
the
first
tap
of
that
hammer
all
very
puzzling
if
you
ask
me
well
shall
i
call
him
back
asked
handy
uneasily
it
kinda
lonely
in
here
and
maybe
himself
could
tell
us
where
we
are
better
wait
till
we
need
him
advised
the
ox
after
all
we
know
we
are
in
a
cave
seems
to
be
of
silver
rock
too
just
cast
your
eye
at
those
stalactites
so
that
what
you
call
the
goat
girl
glanced
curiously
up
at
the
silver
icicles
hanging
in
jagged
points
from
the
ceiling
we
have
caves
on
mt
mern
but
nothing
like
this
she
looked
apprehensively
round
the
silent
cavern
from
which
a
perfect
honeycomb
of
passageways
branched
off
in
all
directions
a
fine
place
to
get
lost
i
call
it
she
shivered
moving
as
close
as
she
could
to
her
companion
what
makes
this
lavender
light
i
see
no
lamps
jewels
confided
the
ox
in
a
hushed
voice
see
there
are
hundreds
of
amethysts
embedded
in
those
rocks
each
glowing
like
an
eye
finished
handy
nervously
and
all
watching
us
i
dare
say
my
y
do
you
suppose
anyone
lives
here
but
they
must
unwinding
her
arms
handy
suddenly
began
snapping
all
of
her
fingers
nox
nox
she
cried
excitedly
i
just
thought
of
something
ca
you
think
without
shouting
asked
the
ox
flashing
his
eyes
suspiciously
from
left
to
right
no
said
handy
triumphantly
for
this
is
something
to
shout
about
look
old
toggins
if
this
is
a
silver
cave
why
would
a
silver
mountain
be
on
top
all
we
have
to
do
is
open
that
door
and
start
climbing
again
as
i
remember
there
was
a
sheer
precipice
back
of
the
waterfall
how
could
we
climb
that
no
no
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
travel
down
one
of
the
passageways
and
hope
it
will
bring
us
out
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
itself
yes
but
which
one
demanded
the
goat
girl
there
are
about
a
hundred
it
seems
to
me
let
try
that
first
one
to
the
right
proposed
the
ox
judiciously
their
voices
echoed
and
reverberated
back
and
forth
so
uncannily
in
the
big
hollow
cavern
that
almost
without
realizing
it
they
began
to
talk
in
whispers
and
tread
as
softly
as
thieves
in
the
night
to
their
destination
they
stopped
rigid
with
horror
and
consternation
thumping
footsteps
were
coming
toward
them
from
the
labyrinth
on
the
left
someone
does
live
here
after
all
said
the
goat
girl
someone
who
weighs
a
ton
hark
to
that
watch
yourself
warned
nox
planting
all
four
feet
and
making
ready
to
charge
if
the
cave
dweller
proved
unfriendly
oh
my
aunt
a
giant
with
a
shrill
scream
handy
flung
all
her
arms
round
nox
neck
and
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
poor
nox
nearly
strangled
by
the
goat
girl
embrace
could
neither
move
nor
speak
and
could
scarcely
breathe
with
rolling
eyes
and
quaking
legs
he
watched
the
monster
approach
the
giant
body
almost
ten
times
the
size
of
a
grizzly
bear
was
encased
in
a
tight
purple
uniform
with
bells
instead
of
buttons
that
jingled
whenever
he
moved
he
wore
a
huge
silver
helmet
and
his
neck
almost
a
foot
long
kept
darting
up
and
down
as
he
shot
his
head
in
this
direction
and
that
ho
there
you
are
he
roared
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
two
travellers
trembling
together
in
the
center
of
the
cavern
how
dare
you
enter
the
cave
of
the
king
of
the
silver
mountain
without
invitation
or
permission
then
this
really
is
the
silver
mountain
marveled
handy
twisting
her
apron
nervously
in
her
wooden
fingers
of
course
yelled
the
giant
thumping
the
floor
with
an
enormous
silver
club
and
i
snorpus
the
mighty
am
keeper
of
the
hidden
door
i
am
outkeeper
for
this
whole
mountain
he
boasted
truculently
expanding
his
chest
and
looking
complacently
down
at
the
two
midgets
at
his
feet
but
something
in
his
manner
began
to
reassure
the
goat
girl
i
bet
he
dumb
as
he
big
she
confided
hurriedly
to
nox
then
raising
her
voice
and
all
of
her
arms
she
called
up
loudly
then
you
must
indeed
be
strong
and
sturdy
oh
i
am
bawled
the
giant
twirling
his
silver
moustache
and
fixing
handy
for
a
moment
with
his
glittering
eye
snorpus
the
door
keeper
is
strong
as
an
ox
there
was
something
very
peculiar
about
the
eye
of
the
giant
it
seemed
to
revolve
on
a
moving
belt
peering
out
as
it
passed
through
the
four
wide
open
lids
set
at
intervals
round
the
top
of
his
head
so
that
half
the
time
he
was
looking
the
other
way
did
you
ever
see
an
ox
inquired
handy
politely
as
the
eye
of
snorpus
again
flashed
by
no
but
i
like
to
admitted
the
giant
shooting
his
head
out
to
the
side
well
this
is
an
ox
cried
handy
tapping
the
anxious
beast
at
her
side
with
a
rubber
hand
and
if
you
are
strong
as
an
ox
you
are
strong
as
nox
and
nothing
much
can
stop
you
how
strong
is
he
asked
snorpus
lowering
himself
stiffly
to
one
knee
in
order
to
get
a
look
at
what
he
had
first
supposed
to
be
a
small
and
insignificant
animal
so
strong
explained
the
goat
girl
impressively
as
she
pointed
with
all
hands
to
the
side
of
the
cave
that
if
he
so
much
as
bumped
into
that
wall
yonder
this
whole
cavern
would
collapse
like
a
pack
of
cards
then
i
hope
he
be
very
careful
faltered
snorpus
taking
out
a
huge
silk
handkerchief
to
mop
his
forehead
it
would
annoy
the
king
frightfully
if
you
destroyed
his
cavern
and
i
might
even
lose
my
head
and
position
here
oh
he
be
careful
promised
handy
mandy
generously
he
being
an
ox
and
you
being
strong
as
an
ox
makes
us
all
friends
does
it
i
i
suppose
so
muttered
snorpus
tapping
his
knee
uncertainly
with
his
club
but
just
the
same
i
am
still
the
outkeeper
and
must
do
my
duty
at
all
hazards
at
all
hazards
he
shouted
standing
up
to
give
himself
courage
and
puffing
out
his
cheeks
like
a
porpoise
but
you
have
done
your
duty
bellowed
nox
in
a
voice
even
louder
than
the
door
keeper
if
we
were
outside
the
mountain
it
would
be
your
plain
duty
to
keep
us
there
but
since
we
are
already
inside
you
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
us
is
that
so
lowering
his
head
nox
made
a
little
lunge
at
the
giant
shins
and
backing
away
snorpus
gave
the
pair
several
long
puzzled
looks
well
then
he
decided
finally
if
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
you
had
best
come
along
to
the
king
that
is
exactly
what
we
wish
to
do
answered
the
goat
girl
promptly
my
you
brave
are
you
the
giant
eye
flashed
for
a
moment
in
real
admiration
upon
handy
mandy
then
picking
up
his
club
he
began
clumping
away
to
the
left
now
i
wonder
what
he
meant
by
that
puffed
nox
for
they
both
had
to
run
to
even
keep
the
giant
in
sight
i
do
know
gasped
handy
but
never
mind
what
he
means
we
still
have
your
golden
horn
and
the
silver
hammer
and
will
manage
somehow
but
imagine
getting
right
inside
the
silver
mountain
and
never
knowing
it
yes
and
we
may
go
out
the
same
way
predicted
the
royal
ox
gloomily
following
the
giant
down
the
wide
glittering
corridor
i
never
did
like
these
tunnely
places
or
people
chapter
the
king
of
the
silver
mountain
i
hear
water
worried
handy
as
snorpus
suddenly
vanished
round
a
bend
in
the
corridor
oh
dear
ear
i
do
hope
we
wo
have
to
go
swimming
again
then
mind
your
manners
warned
the
royal
ox
giving
his
horns
a
little
shake
remember
it
is
safer
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
kings
and
giants
and
if
we
are
to
learn
anything
about
kerry
we
must
be
extremely
patient
and
polite
a
loud
gasp
interrupted
nox
speech
for
handy
mandy
well
in
the
lead
had
also
stepped
round
the
bend
hastening
to
catch
up
with
her
the
ox
too
gave
an
involuntary
exclamation
of
wonder
and
astonishment
the
silver
corridor
had
brought
them
into
a
second
cavern
smaller
than
the
entrance
cave
but
so
light
and
lacy
so
bright
and
beautiful
for
once
handy
mandy
stood
perfectly
speechless
the
silver
sides
of
the
grotto
had
been
carved
to
show
all
the
historical
figures
and
characters
of
ancient
oz
wizards
giants
knights
witches
huntsmen
robbers
kings
queens
and
their
patient
subjects
marched
in
a
splendid
procession
round
the
walls
sparkling
lavender
sand
covered
the
floor
and
a
lake
of
shimmering
quicksilver
took
up
the
entire
center
lapping
the
shore
with
its
swift
soundless
waves
on
a
small
island
of
purest
amethyst
in
the
middle
of
this
lake
the
king
of
the
silver
mountain
reclined
at
ease
his
back
was
toward
the
newcomers
and
he
seemed
lost
in
some
deep
and
entirely
satisfactory
contemplation
a
king
if
i
ever
saw
one
breathed
nox
moistly
in
handy
ear
with
a
wordless
nod
the
goat
girl
agreed
for
in
this
long
indolent
yet
majestic
figure
handy
felt
she
was
seeing
royalty
for
the
first
time
the
unusual
height
of
the
silver
monarch
was
at
once
apparent
and
his
suit
of
deepest
purple
without
ornament
save
for
his
jeweled
belt
and
sword
set
off
his
handsome
figure
to
the
best
advantage
his
hair
of
an
astonishing
thickness
was
as
silver
as
his
cavern
when
he
turned
his
head
as
he
presently
did
at
a
little
cough
from
snorpus
handy
saw
that
his
eyes
were
of
a
clear
and
piercing
violet
quietly
and
without
hurry
the
silver
king
rose
and
picking
up
his
filigreed
crown
set
it
firmly
on
his
head
then
retrieving
a
pipe
from
a
crevice
in
the
rock
he
established
himself
in
a
seat
carved
from
the
amethyst
and
looked
inquiringly
across
at
his
visitors
so
he
whistled
his
eyes
sparkling
with
lively
interest
as
they
rested
for
a
long
moment
on
the
goat
girl
two
very
very
clever
travellers
why
do
you
say
that
blurted
out
handy
and
was
instantly
overcome
at
her
own
boldness
in
speaking
to
so
grand
a
person
the
fact
that
you
are
here
in
this
cavern
proves
you
are
clever
answered
the
king
leaning
over
to
fill
his
pipe
in
the
quicksilver
lake
you
have
opened
the
door
in
the
mountain
that
does
not
open
passed
the
impassable
guardian
and
keeper
of
that
door
snorpus
the
king
pleasant
voice
changed
so
quick
and
cruelly
handy
almost
lost
her
balance
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
you
lazy
bozwokel
roared
his
majesty
his
eyes
flashing
flinty
sparks
of
purple
have
you
potted
for
this
potted
and
reduced
to
a
smithering
smith
do
you
hear
poor
snorpus
who
could
not
have
helped
hearing
the
king
booming
sentence
dropped
to
his
knees
and
began
pleading
explaining
and
blubbering
all
in
the
same
breath
even
nox
startled
as
he
was
tried
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
him
but
the
muttering
monarch
paying
no
attention
to
any
of
them
had
lifted
his
silver
pipe
to
his
lips
and
an
enormous
bubble
was
rising
from
the
bowl
handy
with
chattering
teeth
watched
the
bubble
grow
larger
and
larger
float
off
the
pipe
and
hover
over
the
unlucky
head
of
the
giant
as
snorpus
tried
in
vain
to
dodge
the
bubble
broke
with
the
sound
like
a
doomsday
bell
enveloping
him
in
a
cloudy
mist
when
it
cleared
away
the
giant
was
indeed
reduced
coming
now
scarcely
to
handy
shoulder
how
about
it
shall
we
run
whispered
the
goat
girl
as
the
king
began
to
blow
another
bubble
boy
do
i
feel
a
draft
but
he
not
mad
at
us
answered
the
ox
ducking
nervously
as
the
second
bubble
soared
over
their
heads
wait
be
patient
remember
the
little
king
as
nox
finished
speaking
the
bubble
sailed
off
and
away
down
one
of
the
silver
corridors
leading
away
from
the
royal
cavern
presently
they
heard
a
bell
ringing
in
the
distance
as
the
bubble
broke
and
before
you
could
say
pop
robinson
seventy
little
bell
boys
came
trotting
into
the
cave
take
this
poor
failure
to
nifflepok
and
see
that
he
is
potted
directed
the
king
sternly
setting
down
his
bubble
pipe
have
timano
guard
the
mountain
door
and
see
that
i
am
not
disturbed
important
matters
have
come
up
this
morning
important
matters
yes
yes
your
highness
it
shall
be
done
your
excellency
mumbled
the
bell
boys
pushing
poor
snorpus
ahead
of
them
watch
yourselves
watch
yourselves
warned
the
little
giant
as
he
was
rudely
hustled
out
of
the
royal
presence
now
smiled
the
silver
king
positively
beaming
upon
his
visitors
now
we
can
proceed
with
our
conversation
sorry
to
trouble
you
with
this
small
matter
but
discipline
as
the
old
army
officers
will
tell
you
discipline
must
be
maintained
humph
sniffed
handy
mandy
under
her
breath
looking
with
dislike
and
disillusion
at
the
royal
figure
on
the
rocks
the
giant
was
right
you
a
fellow
who
bear
watching
fortunately
her
words
did
not
carry
and
lazily
glancing
at
them
through
his
long
purple
lashes
the
silver
king
continued
his
speech
since
you
have
so
easily
entered
my
mountain
he
observed
blandly
i
assume
you
have
some
powerful
magic
treasure
or
appliance
in
your
possession
am
i
right
at
the
sudden
forward
lurch
of
the
royal
ox
and
handy
mandy
surprised
expression
the
king
gave
a
satisfied
little
nod
fine
he
chuckled
rubbing
his
hands
together
briskly
and
now
let
us
waste
no
more
time
who
sent
you
what
have
you
to
offer
as
you
doubtless
know
the
wizard
of
wutz
pays
well
for
magic
treasures
and
formulas
wizard
choked
handy
mandy
carelessly
clapping
her
iron
hand
to
her
forehead
and
knocking
herself
over
backward
wizard
she
repeated
dazedly
picking
herself
up
but
i
thought
you
were
a
king
i
am
both
stated
the
owner
of
the
cavern
proudly
i
am
king
of
the
silver
mountain
and
also
the
wizard
of
wutz
second
in
importance
only
to
glinda
and
the
wizard
of
oz
and
ha
ha
it
wo
be
long
before
i
am
the
only
wizard
the
sole
supreme
and
only
wizard
of
oz
not
long
not
long
again
the
silver
king
rubbed
his
hands
exultantly
together
i
have
my
secret
agents
in
every
kingdom
in
this
country
and
even
in
the
emerald
city
of
oz
he
told
them
impressively
i
already
have
the
record
book
of
glinda
the
good
sorceress
and
many
more
of
the
magic
treasures
of
oz
and
soon
i
will
have
them
all
all
my
agents
are
clever
and
i
have
trained
them
well
but
i
thought
magic
was
against
the
law
cried
nox
with
an
outraged
snort
i
understood
no
one
was
allowed
to
practice
magic
but
ozma
glinda
and
the
wizard
of
oz
then
why
are
you
here
demanded
wutz
sternly
you
have
been
practicing
magic
or
you
could
not
have
entered
this
mountain
come
now
let
us
stop
all
this
nonsense
and
get
down
to
silver
tacks
and
business
what
have
you
to
offer
who
sent
you
three
six
nine
five
or
eleven
as
you
can
imagine
this
was
perfect
jargon
to
nox
and
the
goat
girl
but
handy
mandy
convinced
by
this
time
that
the
silver
king
was
both
sly
and
dangerous
resolved
to
fall
in
with
his
little
supposition
and
see
what
would
come
of
it
nine
sent
us
she
answered
boldly
while
nox
looked
across
at
her
in
perfect
stupefaction
you
do
say
i
rather
thought
you
came
from
the
munchkin
country
mused
the
wizard
something
in
the
way
the
ox
talked
though
you
yourself
are
not
a
native
ozian
no
handy
said
noncommittally
and
rather
pleased
she
had
chosen
nine
since
this
number
had
something
to
do
with
the
munchkins
did
nine
say
anything
about
the
silver
hammer
asked
the
king
twinkling
his
eyes
at
the
goat
girl
he
told
us
nothing
stated
handy
quite
truthfully
this
time
that
nine
for
you
fumed
the
king
discontentedly
he
the
slowest
and
most
unsatisfactory
agent
i
have
two
years
searching
for
that
hammer
and
no
report
yet
i
a
good
notion
to
kick
him
out
and
put
little
king
kerry
back
on
the
throne
a
bargain
a
bargain
and
kept
my
part
besides
i
got
to
have
that
hammer
before
i
can
make
myself
supreme
ruler
in
oz
why
it
the
second
most
important
magic
in
the
four
kingdoms
at
this
surprising
statement
handy
pricked
up
her
ears
what
did
you
say
about
kerry
panted
nox
almost
stepping
into
the
quicksilver
lake
at
mention
of
the
little
king
nothing
i
was
talking
about
nine
scowled
the
wizard
if
that
fellow
does
not
show
some
action
soon
i
i
the
king
clenched
his
fists
and
looked
so
terribly
angry
that
handy
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
blow
bubbles
again
but
instead
he
glared
across
the
lake
and
demanded
impatiently
well
if
you
did
bring
the
silver
hammer
what
did
you
bring
a
magic
flower
explained
the
goat
girl
hurriedly
and
before
nox
could
give
away
the
fact
that
they
did
have
the
silver
hammer
she
could
guess
from
the
expression
in
his
eye
that
he
was
about
to
offer
the
hammer
in
exchange
for
kerry
a
flower
bawled
wutz
his
face
turning
from
red
to
purple
my
caves
are
full
of
flowers
frosted
silver
lilies
sterling
roses
daisies
and
violets

you
take
up
my
time
with
a
flower
pah
go
back
and
tell
nine
he
had
better
look
out
he
flirting
with
dismissal
and
destruction
but
this
flower
saves
you
from
injury
when
you
fall
stammered
handy
heartily
wishing
she
had
never
got
herself
into
such
a
controversy
fall
sneered
the
silver
king
simply
bounding
off
his
throne
i
never
fall
and
had
hardly
finished
speaking
before
he
caught
his
toe
on
a
jutting
amethyst
and
pitched
headlong
to
the
rocks
horrified
and
without
waiting
for
the
irate
monarch
to
regain
his
feet
handy
and
nox
began
to
run
toward
one
of
the
outgoing
corridors
the
goat
girl
colliding
as
she
ran
with
a
plump
little
dignitary
in
a
jeweled
robe
and
high
hat
your
highness
your
highness
puffed
the
little
fat
man
stopping
long
enough
to
glare
at
handy
mandy
at
last
our
efforts
are
to
be
crowned
with
success
five
has
but
this
moment
arrived
with
with
with
what
demanded
the
king
springing
lightly
as
a
cat
to
his
feet
with
a
jug
exulted
the
little
fat
man
tossing
his
high
hat
into
the
air
with
a
jug
that
was
rug
and
the
magic
picture
of
queen
ozma
herself
ah
splendid
beamed
the
monarch
who
could
turn
his
smiles
and
rages
on
and
off
like
electric
lights
that
will
be
a
lesson
to
those
emerald
then
suddenly
remembering
handy
and
nox
and
his
undignified
fall
he
shouted
shrilly
stop
those
imposters
stop
them
nifflepok
and
lock
them
up
in
the
prison
pits
till
i
have
time
to
demolish
them
hah
we
pot
the
tongue
make
soup
of
his
tail
saddles
and
boots
of
his
hide
and
use
his
head
for
a
hat
rack
as
for
that
monstrosity
she
shall
work
in
the
polishing
caves
for
the
rest
of
her
stupid
life
i
polish
your
nose
first
promised
handy
shaking
all
her
fists
at
the
king
better
come
quiet
warned
nifflepok
looking
so
worried
handy
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
wutz
blow
bubbles
if
you
make
him
too
mad
and
that
be
much
worse
than
being
locked
up
you
know
oh
let
go
with
the
little
groaned
nox
blinking
his
eyes
at
handy
to
remind
her
they
still
had
his
horns
and
the
silver
hammer
for
my
part
i
like
a
little
peace
and
quiet
take
away
take
away
ordered
the
king
stamping
up
and
down
his
rocky
island
send
in
five
send
in
five
at
once
come
along
then
said
nifflepok
being
careful
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
nox
horns
come
give
me
your
hand
maiden
not
that
one
not
that
one
he
howled
dismally
as
the
goat
girl
clasped
his
outstretched
fingers
in
her
iron
hand
let
go
let
go
let
go
let
go
chuckled
handy
mandy
mischievously
and
squealing
with
pain
the
little
minister
hurried
them
down
a
long
dim
passageway
chapter
down
to
the
prisoners
pit
oh
oh
give
me
another
hand
and
i
do
my
best
to
help
you
sputtered
nifflepok
as
handy
mandy
ruthlessly
continued
to
squeeze
his
fingers
we
help
ourselves
thank
you
retorted
the
goat
girl
tartly
then
relenting
a
little
she
relaxed
her
hold
for
she
could
not
help
pitying
nifflepok
and
all
the
subjects
of
this
cruel
king
where
are
these
prison
pits
she
asked
impatiently
for
she
was
anxious
to
be
alone
with
nox
if
you
are
going
to
lock
us
up
do
hurry
along
with
it
yes
yes
absolutely
yes
moaned
nifflepok
glancing
nervously
over
his
shoulder
to
be
sure
the
white
ox
was
not
going
to
tread
on
his
heels
you
be
there
in
no
time
no
time
at
all
he
assured
them
earnestly
step
over
here
please
moving
a
sliding
door
in
the
wall
of
the
corridor
the
king
assistant
waved
them
toward
a
smooth
wheelless
silver
carriage
it
looked
to
handy
a
lot
like
an
sleigh
and
as
there
were
seats
in
front
and
a
space
in
back
large
enough
for
the
ox
she
let
go
nifflepok
hand
and
quite
willingly
climbed
aboard
nox
grunting
a
little
stepped
over
the
side
and
settled
himself
behind
her
well
goodbye
sniffed
nifflepok
rubbing
his
bruised
fingers
tenderly
you
find
everything
you
need
below
not
that
be
needing
anything
he
added
mournfully
as
he
pulled
out
a
silver
switch
goodbye
i
sorry
for
you
he
shouted
as
the
car
with
a
lurch
that
almost
loosened
handy
teeth
shot
down
a
sliding
runway
to
the
deep
pits
of
darkness
below
now
you
and
i
who
are
used
to
scenic
railways
and
have
enjoyed
the
thrills
of
chute
the
chutes
for
years
would
have
been
less
startled
by
the
wild
dizzy
leaps
the
swoops
curves
and
climbs
and
the
sickening
drops
of
the
silver
king
chariot
but
neither
the
goat
girl
nor
the
royal
ox
had
ever
heard
of
a
scenic
railway
much
less
ridden
in
one
and
the
underground
car
of
the
silver
monarch
was
more
like
a
chute
the
chutes
than
anything
else
sometimes
the
two
travellers
were
in
complete
darkness
at
other
times
they
whirled
by
the
narrow
ledges
of
a
queer
cave
city
where
the
subjects
of
the
mountain
king
lived
in
apertures
in
the
silver
rock
like
the
cliff
dwellers
of
old
then
without
warning
the
car
would
plunge
to
the
work
caverns
below
past
the
gloomy
shafts
of
the
silver
mines
or
dart
up
to
the
living
quarters
and
grottos
of
the
king
himself

so
lavishly
furnished
and
glowing
with
jewels

out

shrieks
of
astonishment
in

bathed
in
the
silver

their
lacy
branches

as
riotously
as
daisies
and

in

mountaineers
themselves
working
listless
with
pick
and
shovel
in
the
mines
or
walking
soberly
along
the
ledges
beside
their
little
cliff
dwellings
seemed
undersized
and
unhappy
to
the
goat
girl
not
that
she
caught
more
than
a
flying
glimpse
of
them
as
the
silver
car
tore
by
in
fact
she
was
so
frantically
busy
holding
on
to
the
front
rail
of
the
car
with
all
her
various
hands
and
catching
her
breath
after
each
dizzy
swoop
that
her
mind
was
in
a
perfect
whirl
the
groans
and
snorts
of
nox
were
far
from
reassuring
but
afraid
to
look
back
lest
she
herself
be
flung
out
handy
clung
desperately
to
the
rail
wondering
when
the
wild
ride
would
end
and
where
under
the
mountain
the
silver
car
was
taking
them
the
last
words
of
nifflepok
rang
unpleasantly
in
her
ears
and
as
they
raced
by
a
cave
marked
potters

the
goat
girl
positively
shuddered

out
in
vast
silver
pots
and
buried
to
their
chins
in
the
silver
earth
were
scores
of
the
king

a
gardener
was
watering
them
from
a
milk

and
from
the
hungry
way
they
lapped
up

drops
that
fell
to
them

that
this
was
probably
their
only

the
distracted

trying
to
collect
her
spinning

oh
my

going
to

oh
this
time
we
are
really
done
for
then
all
at
once
handy
good
common

began
to
assert
itself
and
as
their
strange
chariot
with
a
sudden
increase
of
speed
and
power
again
dashed
down
into
the
darkness
she
snatched
the
precious
blue
flower
from
her
pocket
and
at
the
exact
moment
the
silver
car
turned
over
and
flung
them
into
space
handy
began
pulling
the
petals
from
the
flower
and
letting
them
drift
down
ahead
of
her

falling

was
just

enough
for

to
see

with
bristling
horns
and
quivering
nostrils
fall
past
when
she
herself
started
to
turn
so
many
and
such
dizzy
somersaults
she
lost

of

and
distance
chapter
prisoners
of
the
wizard
what
seemed
to
be
hours
later
though
in
reality
it
was
only
a
few
moments
the
two
luckless
prisoners
found
themselves
side
by
side
on
a
heap
of
soft
blue
flower
petals
they
were
in
a
small
circular
pit
with
one
amethyst
burning
dimly
in
the
grating
that
covered
the
top
the
goat
girl
had
no
recollection
of
her
final
landing
and
gazing
up
at
the
grilled
ceiling
wondered
dully
how
they
had
come
through
without
being
cut
to
pieces
it
tilted
wheezed
the
royal
ox
answering
the
unspoken
question
in
handy
eyes
just
tilted
and
slid
us
down
a
fortunate
thing
you
kept
that
magic
flower
ha
rumph
weakly
and
still
trembling
in
every
limb
nox
tried
to
rise
but
his
legs
gave
way
beneath
him
and
for
a
good
fifteen
minutes
he
and
the
goat
girl
rested
on
the
flower
petals
saying
never
a
word
the
tapping
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
brought
handy
quickly
to
her
feet
and
as
nox
managed
to
heave
himself
upright
the
blue
petals
vanished
leaving
only
a
tiny
flower
on
the
floor
handy
had
just
time
to
stuff
it
into
her
pocket
when
an
invisible
door
in
the
side
of
the
pit
opened
and
twelve
depressed
workmen
in
silver
cloth
caps
and
overalls
stepped
inside
they
carried
brooms
mops
and
dust
pans
and
stood
staring
in
dismay
at
the
goat
girl
and
ox
we
we
were
sent
to
brush
up
stuttered
the
first
workman
touching
his
cap
uneasily
but
there
seems
to
be
nothing
to
brush
finished
handy
sarcastically
sorry
to
disappoint
you
now
get
out
ordered
the
goat
girl
furiously
and
seizing
buckets
brooms
and
mops
from
their
nerveless
fingers
handy
pummeled
them
left
and
right
with
her
seven
hands
get
out
and
do
come
back
till
christmas
she
panted
as
the
workmen
tumbling
over
one
another
clawed
open
the
door
and
banged
it
to
behind
them
the
knob
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
pit
and
not
even
the
edges
of
the
door
were
now
visible
what
a
place
groaned
handy
mandy
leaning
dejectedly
against
the
side
of
their
prison
what
a
king
and
he
looked
so
nice
grieved
the
goat
girl
sliding
down
to
a
sitting
position
and
holding
her
head
in
all
of
her
hands
never
mind
said
the
ox
settling
on
the
floor
beside
her
he
gotten
the
best
of
us
yet
it
was
pretty
clever
of
you
to
remember
that
flower
but
what
i
ca
understand
is
why
you
did
not
tell
him
at
once
that
we
have
this
silver
hammer
he
is
so
anxious
to
possess
then
we
could
have
traded
the
hammer
for
the
release
of
kerry
i
do
trust
him
answered
the
goat
girl
somberly
why
i
trust
that
wizard
as
far
as
a
goat
can
butt
did
you
hear
him
say
the
hammer
was
the
second
most
important
magic
in
oz
did
you
hear
him
say
he
was
stealing
and
planning
to
steal
the
best
magic
from
all
the
four
kingdoms
to
make
himself
supreme
ruler
of
oz
well
now
that
five
has
brought
him
this
or
whatever
it
is
and
ozma
own
magic
picture
he
probably
well
on
the
way
to
realizing
his
ambitions
but
he
not
going
to
get
our
silver
hammer
i
found
it
and
i
going
to
keep
it
for
it
far
safer
with
me
than
with
him
do
you
suppose
we
going
to
help
an
old
bozzywog
like
that
what
good
would
it
do
to
put
kerry
back
on
his
throne
if
wutz
is
to
be
ruler
of
oz
probably
pot
all
the
kings
and
keep
everything
for
himself
very
probably
agreed
nox
wagging
his
head
mournfully
but
what
are
we
to
do
are
we
an
army
to
fight
a
mountain
full
of
silver
moles
and
minions
are
we
magicians
to
risk
our
necks
with
this
wizard
besides
nox
face
grew
thin
and
anxious
if
wutz
has
treated
kerry
the
way
he
has
treated
us
the
boy
needs
us
right
now
and
this
very
minute
but
did
you
hear
him
say
he
put
kerry
back
on
the
throne
if
nine
did
not
soon
find
the
hammer
put
in
handy
patiently
that
proves
the
little
king
is
still
here
and
safe
of
course
we
must
find
him
and
get
him
out
of
this
miserable
mountain
but
we
not
going
to
give
wutz
our
hammer
or
any
help
at
all
and
he
can
put
that
in
his
silver
pipe
and
blow
bubbles
till
he
bursts
said
handy
vindictively
now
the
thing
to
do
is
to
rest
and
eat
and
then
set
ourselves
to
find
the
way
out
of
this
pit
and
this
mountain
wutz
and
nifflepok
think
we
all
swept
away
by
this
time
besides
they
be
too
busy
talking
with
five
to
bother
us
so
first
to
eat
and
then
to
think
proposed
handy
in
a
businesslike
manner
perhaps
you
right
sighed
the
ox
but
i
not
have
an
easy
moment
till
we
out
of
this
magic
mountain
that
ride
nox
lashed
his
tail
and
rolled
his
eyes
at
the
mere
thought
of
their
dash
down
the
underground
railway
did
you
ever
experience
anything
like
it
in
your
life
well
grinned
handy
it
one
way
of
seeing
the
country
i
suppose
but
let
not
look
back
old
toggins
let
look
ahead
remember
we
still
have
the
dwarf
of
the
hammer
on
our
side
and
when
we
are
ready
to
leave
he
surely
show
us
the
way
not
before
i
put
a
few
gores
in
that
wizard
pants
and
plans
rumbled
nox
belligerently
i
teach
him
to
take
liberties
with
the
royal
ox
of
keretaria
hi
yigh
that
the
old
oz
spirit
cheered
handy
reaching
out
to
touch
his
golden
horn
horn
dear
just
serve
two
dinners
and
no
fooling
unscrewing
nox
horn
of
plenty
as
she
spoke
the
goat
girl
held
it
quietly
in
her
wooden
hand
and
there
was
certainly
no
fooling
about
the
two
splendid
dinners
the
horn
delivered
in
answer
to
handy
wish
never
had
she
eaten
a
more
appetizing
repast
and
half
of
the
prison
pit
was
taken
up
by
the
fresh
hay
fruit
and
grains
brought
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
royal
ox
so
forgetting
for
a
time
their
awful
danger
and
their
disagreeable
imprisonment
the
two
adventurers
refreshed
themselves
and
after
the
dishes
and
containers
had
disappeared
settled
down
to
evolve
some
plan
to
outwit
the
wizard
of
wutz
chapter
in
the
emerald
city
of
oz
ten
days
before
the
goat
girl
left
mt
mern
a
weary
and
footsore
pilgrim
arrived
in
the
emerald
city
at
least
he
gave
that
impression
to
all
who
saw
him
shuffling
with
his
long
staff
and
beggar
cup
along
the
shining
streets
of
the
capital
the
man
head
was
clean
shaven
and
his
small
cap
coarse
belted
robe
and
sandals
marked
him
as
a
monk
of
some
old
and
ancient
order
he
nodded
gently
to
each
person
he
passed
and
seemed
in
spite
of
his
many
years
and
wrinkles
innocent
and
harmless
as
a
child
the
splendor
and
magnificence
of
the
capital
astonished
and
bewildered
the
old
gentleman
and
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
disbelief
he
stared
at
the
emerald
studded
streets
and
houses
and
gazed
up
at
the
lofty
peaks
and
spires
of
the
royal
palace
and
this
was
not
strange
for
of
all
the
fairy
cities
out
of
the
world
the
emerald
city
of
oz
is
the
most
dazzling
and
beautiful
but
its
citizens
are
kindly
and
simple
for
all
that
and
many
stopped
to
drop
emeralds
in
the
pilgrim
cup
and
ask
him
if
there
was
anything
else
that
he
needed
to
all
he
mumbled
in
a
strange
and
indistinguishable
tongue
and
seeing
that
he
was
bound
for
the
palace
and
sure
that
ozma
herself
would
know
best
how
to
deal
with
him
the
emerald
let
him
go
his
way
unmolested
the
afternoon
was
warm
and
pleasant
and
ozma
and
some
of
her
favorites
were
having
a
lazy
game
of
croquet
in
the
royal
garden
the
click
of
the
gold
mallets
as
they
tapped
the
gold
balls
presently
attracted
the
attention
of
the
old
wayfarer
who
paused
to
peer
curiously
over
the
hedge
the
simple
summer
dresses
of
the
girls
in
the
garden
seemed
out
of
all
keeping
with
their
majestic
surroundings
except
for
frock
which
was
longer
the
emerald
crown
on
her
dark
curls
and
the
golden
circlets
worn
by
her
three
companions
they
might
have
been
any
four
little
girls
playing
croquet
in
a
garden
but
all
around
were
the
unmistakable
signs
of
rank
and
royalty
at
ease
under
a
lime
tree
stood
a
tall
soldier
with
green
whiskers
leaning
on
his
gun
three
footmen
in
satin
uniforms
stood
stiffly
beside
an
emerald
topped
tea
table
ready
at
a
moment
notice
to
serve
ozade
and
frosted
cake
on
a
gold
bench
nearby
a
straw
stuffed
scarecrow
was
quietly
reading
the
paper
and
walking
arm
in
arm
down
a
little
path
talking
composedly
together
were
an
energetic
little
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
curious
fellow
who
seemed
to
be
constructed
entirely
of
copper
to
all
who
are
familiar
with
the
quaint
and
merry
folk
at
ozma
court
there
would
be
nothing
odd
about
a
live
scarecrow
or
a
mechanical
man
and
most
of
us
would
have
recognized
ozma
companions
at
once
as
dorothy
betsy
and
trot
three
mortal
girls
who
long
ago
came
to
live
in
the
royal
palace
it
was
dorothy
who
had
discovered
the
scarecrow
on
her
first
visit
to
oz
lifting
him
down
from
his
pole
and
traveling
in
his
gay
and
carefree
company
all
the
way
to
the
emerald
city
in
those
days
the
wizard
of
oz
had
been
ruler
of
the
country
he
himself
having
flown
in
a
balloon
from
omaha
astonished
by
the
circus
tricks
of
this
little
fellow
the
ozians
believing
him
to
be
a
real
wizard
made
him
their
sovereign
and
under
his
wise
rule
and
direction
built
the
now
famous
city
of
emeralds
the
sight
of
dorothy
had
made
the
humbug
wizard
homesick
and
after
presenting
the
scarecrow
with
a
fine
set
of
brains
he
flew
off
to
america
in
a
balloon
of
his
own
construction
leaving
the
straw
man
to
rule
in
his
place
afterward
when
ozma
was
disenchanted
and
proved
to
be
the
rightful
ruler
of
oz
the
scarecrow
had
cheerfully
resigned
but
he
still
spends
most
of
his
time
in
the
palace
and
is
one
of
ozma
most
trusted
friends
and
counselors
later
the
wizard
himself
returned
to
oz
and
this
time
took
up
the
study
of
magic
with
such
zeal
and
earnestness
he
was
soon
famous
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
this
made
him
exceedingly
valuable
to
the
young
fairy
ruler
and
he
like
the
scarecrow
is
an
old
and
honored
member
of
ozma
cabinet
it
was
the
wizard
who
was
now
talking
so
earnestly
to
tik
tok
the
metal
man
was
another
of
dorothy
discoveries
she
met
tik
tok
on
her
second
visit
to
oz
and
brought
him
to
the
emerald
city
for
safe
keeping
tik
tok
made
by
the
firm
of
smith
and
tinker
is
a
completely
mechanical
man
and
a
loyal
and
dependable
citizen
when
he
is
properly
wound
up
and
oiled
betsy
and
trot
like
dorothy
arrived
more
or
less
by
wind
wave
and
accident
in
the
land
of
oz
they
liked
it
so
well
and
proved
so
gay
and
amusing
ozma
begged
them
to
stay
with
her
and
dorothy
in
the
green
castle
and
help
rule
the
many
merry
kingdoms
that
make
up
her
wonderful
empire
this
they
were
only
too
happy
to
do
so
here
they
are
princesses
in
their
own
right
and
living
in
the
most
gorgeous
city
out
of
the
world
besides
the
celebrities
in
the
garden
there
are
numerous
other
important
people
at
ozma
court
for
instance
there
is
herby
the
medicine
man
whose
chest
is
really
a
medicine
chest
full
of
pills
cures
and
ointments
then
there
is
scraps
a
lively
girl
made
from
a
patchwork
quilt
by
a
wizard
wife
and
brought
to
life
by
the
wizard
and
there
pigasus
a
flying
pig
there
a
doubtful
dromedary
a
cowardly
lion
a
hungry
tiger
and
dorothy
little
dog
toto
a
glass
cat
belonging
to
scraps
a
wooden
saw
horse
belonging
to
ozma
an
iffin
whom
jack
pumpkinhead
discovered
near
the
land
of
barons
and
a
dozen
more
unique
and
unusual
characters
the
old
pilgrim
seemed
to
find
the
group
in
the
garden
surprising
enough
for
he
watched
them
closely
and
silently
for
almost
ten
minutes
cupping
his
hand
behind
his
ear
in
an
endeavor
to
catch
what
the
wizard
was
saying
it
is
just
as
i
have
told
you
the
little
wizard
was
remarking
earnestly
to
tik
tok
the
great
record
book
of
glinda
has
vanished
from
her
castle
without
trace
or
reason
and
even
with
my
powerful
searchlight
and
looking
glasses
i
have
been
unable
to
discover
any
signs
of
it
word
of
the
theft
came
yesterday
by
pigeon
post
has
it
for
no
good
answered
the
metal
man
solemnly
but
the
old
man
leaning
over
the
hedge
heard
none
of
this
for
the
two
were
conversing
in
low
and
guarded
tones
so
after
a
long
puzzled
look
at
the
scarecrow
the
pilgrim
took
up
his
staff
and
shuffled
along
the
gold
pebbled
path
to
the
palace
itself
a
pompous
footman
in
gold
and
green
came
to
answer
his
timid
knock
at
the
door
what
name
please
what
business
and
why
in
the
wood
does
a
fellow
like
you
come
begging
at
the
door
of
a
castle
inquired
the
footman
in
a
loud
displeased
voice
there
there
puffup
admonished
a
maid
in
a
ribboned
cap
and
apron
peering
around
the
wide
shoulders
of
the
footman
be
so
shouting
proud
you
frightened
the
old
gentleman
half
out
of
his
wits
ca
you
see
he
is
tired
and
hungry
and
probably
in
need
of
a
lunch
at
the
little
maid
kind
speech
the
pilgrim
bowed
at
least
a
dozen
times
nodding
his
head
energetically
to
show
that
she
was
perfectly
right
in
her
conjecture
come
along
with
you
urged
jellia
jamb
giving
him
a
friendly
wink
edging
nervously
past
the
muttering
footman
the
old
beggar
followed
jellia
into
the
castle
spacious
and
splendid
dining
hall
wait
right
here
and
i
bring
you
some
cake
and
apple
sauce
an
omelette
and
a
pot
of
tea
promised
the
obliging
girl
how
will
that
be
jellia
jamb
who
was
ozma
own
personal
maid
and
a
privileged
character
around
the
castle
grinned
cheerfully
at
her
ancient
visitor
and
though
the
old
monk
pretended
not
to
understand
a
word
that
she
said
he
nevertheless
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
with
round
eyes
watched
her
skip
through
the
swinging
door
into
the
pantry
no
sooner
had
jellia
disappeared
than
the
old
rascal
sprang
nimbly
to
his
feet
and
began
to
peer
eagerly
all
around
him
passing
hurriedly
over
a
rich
gold
service
on
the
sideboard
he
pounced
upon
an
earthen
jug
on
a
crystal
stand
and
tucking
it
under
his
robe
slipped
silently
as
a
shadow
out
of
the
dining
hall
up
the
green
carpeted
stairs
and
straight
into
the
private
sitting
room
of
ozma
of
oz
once
there
and
without
losing
a
moment
he
walked
to
the
west
wall
took
down
a
large
gold
framed
picture
blew
upon
it
with
a
small
glass
tube
till
it
was
no
larger
than
a
cake
of
chocolate
and
thrust
it
into
an
inner
pocket
then
holding
his
robe
high
above
his
skinny
shins
and
with
the
jug
clasped
tightly
in
his
arms
he
galloped
down
the
stairs
and
out
an
open
window
into
the
garden
reaching
a
large
clump
of
snowball
bushes
without
encountering
anyone
hiding
himself
well
in
the
bushes
he
tore
off
the
monk
robe
turned
it
inside
out
dragged
a
white
wig
from
his
sock
and
presently
emerged
as
dignified
and
plausible
an
old
grandmother
as
any
one
would
wish
to
see
the
other
side
of
his
robe
was
green
and
made
up
in
a
style
much
affected
by
old
ladies
in
the
capital
so
that
now
he
attracted
no
attention
whatever
the
jug
in
a
large
string
bag
dangled
carelessly
from
his
wrist
and
smiling
and
nodding
amiably
he
hurried
through
the
garden
passed
rapidly
down
one
street
and
another
through
the
high
city
gates
on
and
on
till
he
was
far
out
in
the
country
walking
faster
and
faster
and
less
like
a
monk
or
an
old
lady
at
every
step
chapter
the
robbery
is
discovered
prunes
and
peppermints
ejaculated
the
scarecrow
springing
up
from
his
bench
as
jellia
jamb
with
streaming
eyes
and
cap
ribbons
came
flying
across
the
garden
peanuts
and
pretzels
dorothy
about
to
hit
the
pole
and
win
the
game
dropped
her
mallet
at
jellia
fire
siren
screeches
while
ozma
and
the
others
swung
round
in
amazement
as
the
little
waiting
maid
sobbing
and
panting
rushed
into
their
midst
oh
that
beggar
oh
that
pilgrim
that
old
monk
or
whatever
he
was
wailed
jellia
wiping
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
her
apron
he
gone
and
stolen
the
jug
i
mean
rug
and
oz
knows
what
will
become
of
us
there
there
my
girl
stop
crying
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
us
just
what
happened
begged
the
scarecrow
patting
jellia
clumsily
on
the
shoulder
but
this
is
serious
very
serious
muttered
the
wizard
who
had
at
once
realized
the
importance
of
the
little
maid
news
if
ruggedo
is
released
from
that
jug
and
enchantment
he
be
up
to
his
old
tricks
in
no
time
and
doing
anything
in
his
power
to
hurt
and
destroy
us
but
who
could
have
known
we
turned
ruggedo
into
a
jug
or
where
the
jug
was
kept
and
why
would
anyone
steal
an
old
earthenware
pitcher
when
there
are
so
many
other
rare
and
beautiful
objects
in
the
palace
ozma
looking
anxious
and
troubled
seated
herself
on
the
bench
beside
the
scarecrow
the
same
person
who
knew
the
value
of
glinda
record
book
and
stole
that
answered
the
wizard
gloomily
dark
forces
are
at
work
in
oz
my
dear
dark
forces
just
how
did
this
rascal
look
jellia
like
an
old
monk
with
a
beggar
cup
said
the
little
maid
with
a
sorrowful
sniff
he
seemed
so
poor
and
hungry
i
went
off
to
get
him
something
to
eat
and
no
sooner
was
my
back
turned
than
he
grabbed
the
jug
and
ran
off
though
he
shuffled
slowly
enough
when
he
came
into
the
palace
disguised
of
course
observed
the
scarecrow
raising
one
eyebrow
and
no
more
a
monk
than
i
am
but
what
was
he
monkeying
round
here
for
and
what
could
he
want
with
that
jug
even
if
he
knew
it
was
the
old
gnome
king
really
you
know
you
should
let
perfect
strangers
into
the
palace
jellia
just
what
i
was
telling
her
wheezed
puffup
breathlessly
adding
himself
to
the
group
on
the
lawn
and
i
hopes
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
miss
if
we
just
knew
where
the
old
villain
came
from
worried
the
wizard
tapping
his
fingers
absently
on
tik
tok
copper
arm
or
where
he
was
going
finished
dorothy
pushing
back
her
crown
why
not
look
in
the
proposed
the
machine
man
calmly
the
would
show
us
where
he
is
now
of
course
it
would
ozma
rewarded
tik
tok
with
a
bright
smile
and
jumping
up
the
little
fairy
hurried
across
the
garden
and
into
the
palace
with
the
others
just
a
few
steps
behind
her
but
when
they
reached
the
small
sitting
room
where
the
magic
picture
was
hung
of
course
it
was
not
there
and
now
in
real
distress
and
consternation
they
all
sat
down
to
discuss
the
mysterious
forces
working
against
them
i
thought
ruggedo
was
the
only
enemy
i
had
left
sighed
ozma
leaning
wearily
back
in
her
satin
tufted
arm
chair
i
thought
when
we
turned
the
gnome
king
to
a
jug
all
our
troubles
would
be
over
stole
the
jug
knows
that
was
once
the
who
tried
and
to
oz
rasped
tik
tok
in
his
slow
and
precise
fashion
right
agreed
the
wizard
striding
up
and
down
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
whoever
stole
that
jug
and
the
magic
picture
plans
to
disenchant
the
gnome
king
and
learn
from
him
the
best
way
to
destroy
us
but
that
will
be
pretty
difficult
asserted
the
little
wizard
thrusting
out
his
chin
that
transformation
was
one
of
the
best
you
ever
made
my
dear
ozma
one
of
the
best
it
will
take
a
pretty
smart
wizard
to
turn
that
jug
back
to
rug
again
whoever
stole
the
jug
and
ozma
magic
picture
was
pretty
smart
betsy
bobbin
reminded
him
seriously
and
without
the
picture
how
we
going
to
find
out
who
it
is
ca
you
do
something
wiz
dear
or
do
we
just
have
to
sit
around
and
wait
to
be
conquered
i
shall
go
to
my
laboratory
at
once
decided
the
wizard
importantly
and
there
by
some
magic
means
i
try
to
discover
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
wretched
plotting
and
thievery
lock
up
the
magic
treasures
in
your
safe
ozma
especially
the
gnome
king
magic
belt
and
have
them
guarded
day
and
night
briskly
the
little
wizard
rushed
out
of
the
room
returning
in
a
moment
to
repeat
gloomily
day
and
night
and
i
go
and
drill
the
army
declared
the
scarecrow
stepping
recklessly
out
an
open
french
window
and
falling
flat
but
undaunted
in
a
flower
bed
below
and
i
better
call
tige
and
the
cowardly
lion
said
dorothy
who
had
always
found
the
lion
a
splendid
fighter
in
spite
of
his
cowardice
and
the
hungry
tiger
ready
at
the
drop
of
a
handkerchief
to
protect
his
royal
patrons
with
tooth
and
claw
they
can
sit
right
here
beside
the
safe
and
i
just
like
to
see
anyone
get
by
them
maybe
it
will
be
someone
they
can
not
see
shivered
betsy
peering
out
into
the
darkening
garden
oh
my
is
it
too
exciting
trot
bouncing
up
and
down
on
a
small
sofa
leaned
over
to
touch
ozma
on
the
knee
it
reminds
me
of
the
time
ugu
the
shoemaker
stole
all
the
magic
treasures
in
oz
remember
ozma
looking
at
the
space
where
her
magic
picture
had
hung
nodded
her
head
sorrowfully
saddened
and
sobered
by
the
thought
that
she
still
had
dangerous
and
unscrupulous
enemies
in
oz
chapter
the
pilgrim
returns
to
the
mountain
travelling
northward
by
foot
and
as
quickly
as
he
could
number
five

to

a

moments
after

in

by

to
appear

had
at
once
taken
five
to
the
den
where
wutz
carried
on
all
his
magic
experiments
and
kept
his
valuable
treasures
and
quite
sure
none
of
the
other
agents
had
been
as
successful
as
he
five
paced
impatiently
up
and
down
fancying
himself
already
with
the
wizard
in
oz
so
there
you
are
at
last
entering
from
an
invisible
door
in
the
back
of
his
work
shop
wutz
stared
coldly
at
five
well
what
trash
is
that
you
have
stolen
was
asked
finally
the
wizard
always
pretended
the
discoveries
of
his
agents
were
of
little
use
and
importance
and
when
five
completely
taken
aback
and
crestfallen
began
to
explain
the
wonderful
properties
of
the
magic
picture
and
the
fact
that
the
old
jug
had
once
been
the
powerful
king
of
the
gnomes
the
silver
monarch
cut
him
short
yes
yes
but
just
see
what

brought

told
him
gloatingly

a
trick
known
only
to
himself

stolen
and
transported
to
our
mountain
the
great
record
book
of

the
good
sorceress
following
the
direction
of

imperious
finger
five
gazed
jealously
at
a
huge
volume
chained
with
golden
chains
to
its
marble
stand
in
that
book
went
on
the
wizard
quickly
everything
that
ever
happened
in
oz
is
recorded
not
only
everything
that
has
happened
but
everything
that
is
happening
you
can
see
the
entries
appearing
at
this
very
minute
on
the
open
page
i
see
i
see
five
scarcely
glanced
at
the
record
book
but
this
magic
picture
shows
you
any
person
you
desire
to
look
at
with
this
picture
and
the
help
of
the
powerful
gnome
king
now
disguised
as
a
jug
we
can
soon
make
ourselves
rulers
of
oz
all
we
need
to
do
is
release
ruggedo
from
his
enchantment
i
have
been
told
by
people
in
the
emerald
city
that
ruggedo
is
familiar
with
all
the
magic
secrets
of
ozma
and
the
wizard
of
oz
and
is
besides
a
skilful
magician
himself
once
we
have
disenchanted
him
everything
will
be
easy
we
we
sneered
wutz
who
secretly
agreed
with
five
but
would
not
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it
well
put
the
picture
there
on
that
stand
so
i
can
examine
it
show
us
this
silly
ruler
of
oz
who
sets
herself
above
all
other
rulers
he
ordered
sharply
where
is
she
now
and
what
is
she
doing
then
though
the
wizard
and
five
and
nifflepok
who
had
come
noiselessly
into
the
workshop
gazed
into
the
canvas
till
their
eyes
stung
and
watered
not
a
single
figure
appeared
to
enlighten
them
hah
a
hoax
raged
the
silver
king
rushing
at
five
and
shaking
him
till
his
armor
rattled
how
dare
you
fool
me
in
this
dangerous
manner
but
it
not
a
hoax
screamed
five
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
it
worked
perfectly
well
in
the
castle
perhaps
it
was
hurt
when
you
reduced
it
to
carry
it
here
put
in
nifflepok
nervously
he
was
always
trying
to
keep
peace
between
the
cruel
king
and
his
subjects
perhaps
it
only
obeys
the
commands
of
ozma
its
rightful
owner
and
remember
you
still
have
the
jug
and
the
magic
record
book
the
record
book
might
even
explain
about
the
picture
he
suggested
hopefully
i
thought
so
it
says
here
magic
picture
and
rug
the
jug
have
been
stolen
from
the
castle
of
ozma
of
oz
by
an
agent
of
the
silver
king
there
exclaimed
five
brushing
himself
off
indignantly
i
told
you
it
was
the
one
and
only
picture
yes
but
what
good
is
it
to
me
if
it
does
work
scoffed
the
wizard
i
not
have
you
potted
this
time
five
but
next
time
bring
me
damaged
goods
and
old
jugs
bring
something
of
real
value
as
five
red
faced
and
furious
jerked
himself
out
of
the
king
presence
wutz
turned
joyfully
to
nifflepok
getting
on
old
tubbykins
getting
on
without
that
magic
picture
ozma
will
not
be
able
to
trace
her
stolen
property
and
without
the
record
book
glinda
will
not
be
able
to
help
her
so
who
to
stop
us
from
stealing
everything
everything
exulted
wutz
picking
up
the
earthen
jug
and
waving
it
over
his
head
but
do
you
think
it
wise
to
treat
our
agents
so
shabbily
sighed
nifflepok
they
might
betray
us
you
know
oh
no
they
wo
sniffed
the
wizard
grinning
broadly
at
his
anxious
little
assistant
the
way
i
treat
them
is
perfectly
all
right
keeps
them
on
their
toes
and
with
each
trying
to
outdo
the
other
we
get
the
best
results
well
i
hope
you
right
nifflepok
still
looked
unconvinced
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
out
of
your
line
niffy
just
leave
the
thinking
to
me
now
fetch
me
my
magic
blower
there
a
good
fellow
till
i
see
what
can
be
done
with
this
jug
it
may
take
some
time
and
doing
to
release
this
ugly
little
gnome
by
the
way
did
you
pulverize
those
meddling
munchkins
oh
yes
nifflepok
nodded
his
head
with
a
little
shudder
of
distaste
i
shot
them
down
into
the
prisoner
pit
just
as
your
majesty
commanded
that
strange
the
wizard
in
crossing
the
den
to
fetch
a
glass
test
tube
had
paused
for
a
moment
beside
the
book
of
records
it
says
here
goat
girl
from
mern
and
the
royal
ox
are
in
the
silver
king
mountain
planning
to
release
the
little
king
of
keretaria
so
that
what
brought
them
here
mused
the
wizard
softly
now
then
nifflepok
something
must
have
slipped
up
instead
of
down
if
your
prisoners
were
powdered
or
pulverized
how
could
they
be
planning
and
plotting
they
must
have
some
powerful
magic
to
help
them
muttered
nifflepok
or
how
could
they
have
survived
that
fall
better
find
out
my
dear
fellow
go
spy
on
those
munchkins
and
if
their
magic
is
important
or
worth
while
come
back
and
tell
me
and
in
the
future
be
more
careful
how
you
carry
out
my
orders
and
instructions
the
wizard
voice
was
still
low
and
pleasant
but
his
eyes
flashed
so
threateningly
nifflepok
rushed
out
of
the
royal
work
den
flung
himself
in
the
silver
car
and
went
speeding
down
to
the
prison
pits
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
chapter
the
wizard
bargain
while
nifflepok
had
been
interviewing
five
handy
and
nox
had
been
having
a
troublesome
conference
of
their
own
each
plan
they
devised
for
finding
the
little
king
and
escaping
from
the
silver
mountain
proved
impractical
to
summon
the
hammer
elf
to
release
them
from
the
prison
pit
would
probably
rouse
the
underground
guards
and
minions
of
the
wizard
and
give
wutz
himself
an
opportunity
to
steal
the
hammer
to
tap
the
hammer
lightly
and
ask
the
advice
of
himself
had
next
seemed
a
good
idea
but
as
nox
quickly
pointed
out
that
too
was
dangerous
in
a
wizard
den
like
this
anything
can
happen
groaned
the
ox
looking
around
with
a
gloomy
eye
how
do
we
know
we
are
not
being
watched
at
this
very
moment
if
you
so
much
as
show
that
hammer
somebody
may
pounce
in
here
and
snatch
it
away
which
will
leave
us
with
nothing
to
protect
ourselves
with
in
a
last
emergency
except
that
blue
flower
my
horns
and
your
hands
handy
did
not
like
the
sound
of
last
emergency
but
even
handy
realized
they
would
not
escape
from
the
mountain
without
some
sort
of
battle
to
the
free
and
mountain
girl
every
minute
underground
was
sheer
torture
she
longed
for
a
breath
of
the
pure
upper
air
and
the
unreal
light
and
pale
faces
of
wutz
underground
citizens
and
workers
filled
her
with
pity
and
loathing
of
course
no
matter
how
long
they
leave
us
here
your
horn
of
plenty
will
keep
us
from
starving
but
if
we
do
soon
find
some
way
out
i
believe
explode
she
choked
in
a
desperate
voice
let
look
at
the
message
in
that
silver
ball
again
suggested
nox
unexpectedly
are
you
sure
you
read
it
all
there
might
have
been
directions
on
the
other
side
i
do
think
so
said
handy
shaking
her
head
then
because
action
of
any
sort
was
a
relief
she
deftly
twisted
off
nox
left
horn
and
tilted
the
silver
balls
into
one
of
her
always
handy
palms
the
first
ball
when
she
opened
it
contained
nothing
further
than
the
silver
key
in
the
center
of
the
second
lay
the
same
folded
paper
but
this
time
when
handy
unfolded
the
paper
there
was
a
new
message
inside
wait
cautioned
the
little
slip
of
paper
in
small
blue
letters
do
nothing
until
the
wizard
appears
oh
breathed
the
royal
ox
touching
the
paper
gently
with
his
nose
someone
is
helping
us
then
i
better
keep
this
silver
ball
in
my
pocket
decided
the
goat
girl
where
i
can
easily
get
it
in
a
tight
corner
i
might
not
have
a
chance
to
unscrew
your
horn
dear
ear
how
puzzling
it
all
grows
so
we
to
hear
from
the
wizard
again
whist
what
was
that
as
handy
with
her
wooden
hand
slipped
the
first
ball
back
into
the
horn
with
her
leather
hand
screwed
the
horn
back
on
nox
head
and
with
one
of
her
best
white
hands
stuffed
the
second
ball
and
message
into
her
pocket
they
heard
agitated
footsteps
pattering
along
the
outside
corridor
after
a
tense
moment
however
they
died
away
and
exchanging
a
relieved
glance
nox
and
handy
settled
down
to
wait
for
the
wizard
the
footsteps
as
you
have
already
guessed
belonged
to
nifflepok
peering
in
at
them
through
an
invisible
window
the
king
messenger
had
been
just
in
time
to
see
handy
shaking
the
silver
balls
from
the
golden
horn
without
waiting
to
see
what
use
they
would
make
of
this
curious
magic
nifflepok
rushed
back
to
inform
his
master
they
are
wizards
he
panted
bursting
unceremoniously
into
the
silver
king
den
the
magic
is
in
the
ox
horn
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
the
maiden
shaking
silver
balls
from
his
horn
what
do
care
about
silver
balls
snarled
wutz
who
was
in
a
terrible
temper
if
i
had
them
here
i
bounce
you
over
the
head
with
them
the
den
was
full
of
sulphurous
smoke
but
the
earthenware
jug
still
stood
unchanged
on
the
table
before
him
the
magic
in
the
emerald
city
is
still
better
than
mine
hissed
the
silver
monarch
his
voice
quivering
with
anger
and
disappointment
i
tried
every
single
formula
in
my
book
of
incantations
every
straight
and
crooked
pass
in
the
magician
manual
every
powder
and
potion
on
my
shelves
and
this
ugly
jug
is
still
a
jug
and
nothing
but
a
jug
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
yelled
furiously
think
of
something
you
pig
i
must
have
the
help
of
this
little
gnome
king
but
how
i
going
to
get
him
out
of
the
jug
perhaps
with
a
little
more
time
faltered
nifflepok
twisting
his
high
hat
nervously
in
his
hands
time
time
exploded
the
wizard
when
did
time
ever
break
an
enchantment
snatching
up
a
pair
of
silver
pliers
he
flung
them
wrathfully
at
his
assistant
nifflepok
fortunately
for
his
head
caught
the
dangerous
missile
in
his
hat
and
darting
behind
a
tall
cabinet
looked
pleadingly
out
at
his
unreasonable
master
wait
wait
he
begged
earnestly
as
wutz
with
a
menacing
frown
took
up
his
silver
bubble
pipe
i
have
thought
of
something
make
these
munchkins
break
the
gnome
king
enchantment
they
have
passed
all
the
hazards
of
our
mountain
unharmed
undoubtedly
the
girl
is
a
sorceress
and
the
ox
a
powerful
magician
in
disguise
let
them
do
this
trifling
service
for
your
majesty
in
return
for
the
useless
captive
we
are
holding
for
number
nine
hm
mmmm
deliberately
the
silver
monarch
put
down
his
pipe
not
a
bad
idea
niffle
not
a
bad
idea
at
all
picking
up
the
jug
wutz
brushed
rudely
by
his
trembling
little
minister
and
hurried
out
of
his
workshop
a
few
minutes
later
he
stood
bowing
and
smiling
before
the
two
travelers
in
the
prisoner
pit
but
warned
by
the
message
in
the
silver
ball
his
entrance
through
the
invisible
door
neither
frightened
nor
impressed
handy
mandy
or
the
royal
ox
so
here
you
are
at
last
exclaimed
the
goat
girl
looking
the
silver
monarch
sternly
in
the
eye
and
about
time
too
how
dare
you
imprison
us
in
this
miserable
pit
for
no
reason
at
all
oh
yes
there
is
a
reason
stated
wutz
a
little
surprised
at
defiance
you
broke
into
my
mountain
without
invitation
or
permission
and
as
you
are
nothing
but
a
pair
of
trespassers
you
certainly
deserve
imprisonment
and
even
destruction
nonsense
snorted
the
royal
ox
lurching
forward
heavily
we
came
here
seeking
a
lost
boy
whom
you
are
unlawfully
holding
captive
as
soon
as
you
release
the
little
king
of
keretaria
we
will
take
him
and
leave
this
mountain
and
the
sooner
you
tell
us
where
he
is
the
better
added
handy
snapping
her
fingers
under
the
silver
king
nose
ah
you
think
so
sneered
wutz
well
nothing
is
ever
given
for
nothing
in
this
mountain
but
i
may
give
you
a
chance
to
earn
the
release
here
in
my
hand
is
a
jug
an
ordinary
enough
looking
jug
with
the
magic
you
have
in
your
possession
you
must
transform
this
jug
to
its
proper
shape
if
you
succeed
you
and
the
ox
and
the
boy
king
of
keretaria
may
leave
my
mountain
unharmed
if
you
fail
ha
ha
the
heartless
wizard
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
uproariously
if
you
fail
the
walls
of
this
pit
will
contract
until
you
are
well
shall
we
say
obliterated
to
keep
your
part
of
the
bargain
and
perform
this
slight
service
i
will
give
you
hour
here
is
the
jug
and
in
case
you
fail
good
gillikins
whistled
nox
as
the
wizard
strode
through
the
invisible
door
and
left
them
alone
what
does
that
fool
think
we
are
wizards
magicians
necromancers
groaning
and
snorting
he
began
to
gallop
round
and
round
the
hot
little
pit
look
out
look
out
you
break
the
jug
warned
handy
snatching
it
up
in
her
arms
and
for
goat
sake
stop
that
galloping
i
dizzy
enough
as
it
is
but
you
heard
what
he
said
lowed
the
ox
coming
to
a
trembling
stop
beside
her
what
are
we
to
do
we
know
nothing
of
magic
or
magic
transformations
in
their
distress
and
excitement
they
both
forgot
there
might
be
a
message
to
help
them
in
the
silver
ball
and
handy
taking
the
jug
in
one
of
her
white
hands
surveyed
it
with
horror
and
curiosity
it
so
old
and
ugly
now
said
the
goat
girl
slowly
i
bet
it
was
something
old
and
ugly
to
begin
with
did
nifflepok
mention
something
about
a
jug
that
was
a
rug
maybe
it
a
rug
though
more
likely
a
rogue
say
i
wonder
if
i
broke
the
jug
whether
that
would
not
break
the
enchantment
oh
no
no
no
do
do
that
begged
nox
rolling
his
eyes
in
terror
if
you
break
the
jug
the
wizard
will
be
furious
and
how
do
you
know
what
will
break
the
spell
here
let
me
look
at
it
passing
the
jug
rapidly
from
one
hand
to
another
handy
started
to
place
it
on
the
floor
under
nox
nose
with
her
seventh
and
last
hand
when
a
sudden
and
unexpected
scream
from
the
interior
made
her
drop
it
with
a
loud
crash
to
the
silver
stones
ouch
oh
stop
how
dare
you
bang
me
around
in
this
hateful
manner
up
from
the
flying
fragments
of
earthenware
at
handy
feet
sprang
a
fierce
little
gnome
with
a
long
ragged
beard
shaking
his
fists
and
howling
like
a
child
oh
my
y
i
actually
done
it
quavered
the
goat
girl
falling
over
against
nox
look
look
did
i
tell
you
it
would
be
old
and
ugly
the
gnome
at
handy
words
suddenly
stopped
howling
where
am
i
where
am
i
who
am
i
he
mumbled
in
a
frightened
voice
well
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
afraid
you
in
a
pretty
bad
place
said
handy
straightening
up
to
have
a
better
look
at
her
handiwork
you
in
the
underground
caverns
of
the
king
of
the
silver
mountain
if
you
must
know
caverns
beamed
the
gnome
his
face
breaking
into
a
wide
smile
what
the
matter
with
caverns
i
love
caverns
why
i
used
to
live
in
one
myself
and
who
did
you
say
i
was
we
do
know
who
you
are
explained
nox
in
a
cautious
voice
a
moment
ago
and
before
handy
took
you
in
hand
you
were
nothing
but
a
jug
a
jug
pondered
the
gnome
pulling
his
beard
thoughtfully
you
mean
to
say
i
was
a
jug
maybe
your
name
volunteered
the
goat
girl
now
quite
interested
in
her
transformation
no
not
but
something
like
a
jug
let
me
think
bug
hug
chug
mug
pug
that
it
that
my
name
shrieked
the
little
gnome
joyfully
and
now
i
know
who
i
am
well
who
are
you
inquired
the
ox
stretching
his
royal
nose
down
toward
the
whirling
gnome
i
why
am
the
most
important
king
on
the
other
side
of
the
desert
shouted
ruggedo
exultantly
i
am
the
one
and
only
metal
monarch
and
ruler
of
all
the
gnomes
my
caves
and
caverns
under
the
mountains
of
ev
sparkle
with
jewels
and
precious
stones
mined
by
my
faithful
workers
and
my
grand
army
of
gnomes
outnumbers
any
army
in
oz
proudly
the
ragged
little
king
thumped
himself
upon
the
chest
oh
my
oh
me
oh
mercy
ercy
if
you
as
powerful
as
all
that
maybe
you
help
us
cried
the
goat
girl
clasping
her
hands
eagerly
help
you
why
should
i
help
you
the
little
gnome
stared
scornfully
at
the
two
occupants
of
the
cave
because
she
broke
your
jug
and
enchantment
you
ungrateful
little
wretch
snorted
nox
lowering
his
horns
and
you
do
look
like
a
king
to
me
you
just
look
like
a
plain
ordinary
wicked
little
ragamuffin
a
rugamuffin
he
bellowed
angrily
chapter
out
of
the
prison
pit
nox
angry
words
had
a
strange
effect
on
the
boastful
gnome
king
leaning
dejectedly
against
the
side
of
the
pit
he
drew
his
hand
wearily
across
his
forehead
i
remember
now
he
told
them
hoarsely
i
once
was
the
powerful
metal
monarch
but
that
was
before
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
ozma
and
that
wicked
wizard
of
oz
so
it
was
ozma
who
turned
you
to
a
jug
exclaimed
handy
with
all
her
hands
on
her
hips
yes
and
before
that
she
deprived
me
of
my
kingdom
ducked
me
in
a
truth
pond
marooned
me
for
years
on
a
desert
island
struck
me
dumb
and
then
when
she
could
think
of
nothing
worse
turned
me
to
this
jug
screamed
ruggedo
kicking
at
the
fragments
of
broken
china
at
his
feet
you
and
ozma
have
been
enemies
for
a
long
time
then
observed
the
ox
looking
at
the
gnome
with
great
disfavor
yes
yes
ever
since
that
girl
dorothy
stole
my
magic
belt
and
gave
it
to
ozma
raged
ruggedo
stamping
furiously
up
and
down
and
every
time
i
try
to
recover
my
own
property
or
capture
those
wretched
girls
and
the
emerald
city
something
goes
wrong
and
they
conquer
me
the
last
time
ozma
turned
me
to
a
jug
cried
ruggedo
his
voice
rising
to
a
shrill
whistle
well
what
did
you
expect
inquired
handy
mandy
sharply
that
ozma
would
sit
calmly
on
her
throne
and
allow
you
to
conquer
her
my
y
such
goings
on
oh
then
you
are
friends
of
ozma
said
the
gnome
king
suspiciously
but
no
you
could
not
be
her
friends
or
you
would
not
have
broken
the
jug
who
are
you
the
ox
is
usual
enough
except
for
his
golden
horns
but
you
ruggedo
eyes
grew
round
and
anxious
as
he
looked
at
the
goat
girl
are
odd
are
you
no
she
not
odd
snapped
the
royal
ox
severely
he
had
been
through
so
much
with
the
sturdy
mountain
lass
he
felt
almost
as
if
they
were
related
handy
is
just
seven
times
as
smart
and
seven
times
as
handy
as
most
people
that
all
and
since
her
seven
hands
have
served
you
pretty
well
try
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
will
you
oh
all
right
ruggedo
scuffing
his
foot
looked
sulkily
from
one
to
the
other
much
obliged
i
sure
but
what
in
rockets
are
we
doing
in
this
miserable
hole
and
what
are
we
waiting
for
for
a
fellow
metal
monarch
and
wizard
answered
a
smooth
voice
and
appearing
as
quietly
as
he
had
vanished
wutz
stood
calmly
before
them
come
with
me
ruggedo
i
have
surprising
news
for
you
comrade
and
without
so
much
as
a
nod
or
thank
you
to
nox
and
handy
mandy
he
linked
his
arm
through
the
gnome
and
drew
him
through
the
invisible
door
slamming
it
viciously
behind
him
hi
yi
yelled
handy
mandy
indignantly
come
back
here
come
back
here
a
bargain
a
bargain
you
old
cheat
and
villain
we
kept
our
part
and
you
shall
keep
yours
where
have
you
hidden
the
little
king
of
keretaria
let
us
out
let
us
out
you
false
faced
rascal
nox
as
angry
as
handy
charged
forward
butting
his
head
against
the
exact
spot
where
the
wizard
had
disappeared
to
his
astonishment
and
joy
the
whole
section
of
wall
swung
outward
and
he
and
the
goat
girl
rushing
through
found
themselves
in
a
narrow
dimly
lit
silver
tunnel
to
think
to
think
we
could
have
got
out
any
time
gulped
the
royal
ox
in
a
vexed
voice
the
door
was
invisible
but
not
locked
imagine
that
oh
i
other
things
to
do
puffed
handy
peering
down
the
long
passageway
to
see
whether
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
two
kings
no
use
trying
to
imagine
anything
about
this
mountain
it
just
plain
bewitched
and
goblinish
but
that
wizard
made
us
a
promise
and
going
to
see
that
he
keeps
it
come
on
no
no
said
the
royal
ox
leaning
weakly
against
the
side
of
the
tunnel
i
could
bear
to
look
at
him
again
at
least
not
just
yet
wait
i
may
think
of
something
else
wait
bellowed
nox
as
handy
in
spite
of
his
pleas
started
off
on
a
run
there
now
you
dropped
something
out
of
your
pocket
that
silver
ball
muttered
handy
scooping
it
up
without
slackening
her
pace
the
ball
the
exclaimed
nox
galloping
breathlessly
to
catch
up
with
her
oh
what
muddle
heads
muddle
heads
it
told
us
to
wait
for
the
wizard
quick
see
what
it
says
now
well
a
lot
of
good
it
did
waiting
for
that
wizard
grumbled
the
goat
girl
but
nevertheless
she
stopped
and
opened
the
silver
ball
taking
out
the
folded
paper
she
held
it
up
toward
an
amethyst
gleaming
dully
in
the
side
of
the
tunnel
follow
me
directed
the
paper
rather
mysteriously
but
who
does
mean
asked
handy
as
nox
still
breathing
heavily
read
the
message
over
her
shoulder
i
do
see
any
me
do
you
beans
and
butternuts
if
you
had
stopped
me
i
have
caught
those
villains
by
this
time
and
what
good
would
that
have
done
sniffed
the
ox
impatiently
remember
there
are
two
of
them
now
and
that
little
gnome
is
worse
than
wutz
and
twice
as
dangerous
closing
his
eyes
in
an
effort
to
concentrate
nox
repeated
over
the
message
follow
me
follow
me
follow
me
why
of
course
it
as
plain
as
oats
he
snorted
joyfully
means
that
ball
put
the
message
back
in
the
ball
set
the
ball
down
and
then
see
what
happens
and
what
happened
was
amazing
enough
for
the
silver
ball
once
it
was
on
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
began
to
roll
rapidly
along
ahead
of
them
faster
and
faster
and
faster
till
handy
and
nox
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
it
in
sight
where
do
you
suppose
it
taking
us
gasped
the
goat
girl
thankful
that
so
far
the
tunnel
had
been
more
or
less
straight
and
fairly
well
lighted
to
kerry
said
the
royal
ox
positively
now
watch
that
turn
what
ahead
it
growing
so
dark
i
ca
even
see
my
own
shadow
it
a
flight
of
steps
whispered
handy
gazing
fearfully
into
the
deep
well
of
a
circular
stairway
winding
down
into
the
darkness
they
could
hear
the
chink
of
the
silver
ball
as
it
rolled
from
step
to
step
so
taking
her
courage
in
all
hands
the
goat
girl
herself
began
to
descend
nox
grunting
and
muttering
lugubriously
came
just
behind
her
steps
were
difficult
enough
for
the
ox
at
any
time
but
negotiating
a
flight
of
circular
steps
in
pitch
darkness
was
terrifying
and
dangerous
in
the
extreme
be
careful
warned
handy
looking
up
anxiously
do
slip
or
you
break
my
heart
more
than
that
i
afraid
quavered
the
royal
ox
setting
his
front
feet
cautiously
on
the
step
below
while
he
balanced
his
hind
quarters
perilously
on
the
one
above
chapter
wutz
and
the
gnome
king
leave
for
the
capital
meanwhile
wutz
and
ruggedo
had
shot
up
in
the
wizard
silver
car
and
were
now
in
earnest
conversation
together
how
in
suds
did
that
girl
break
your
enchantment
asked
wutz
dropping
irritably
to
his
silver
workbench
i
was
watching
her
every
minute
through
an
invisible
window
and
i
did
see
her
do
a
thing
but
break
the
jug
now
why
could
i
have
thought
of
that
oh
what
does
it
matter
ruggedo
settled
himself
with
a
joyful
little
wriggle
beside
the
silver
monarch
what
does
it
matter
so
long
as
i
am
free
and
able
to
help
you
so
you
really
think
you
can
make
yourself
ruler
of
oz
he
went
on
glancing
enviously
round
the
wizard
well
stocked
den
with
its
tables
full
of
magic
apparatus
and
its
shelves
and
shelves
of
dusty
volumes
of
wizard
and
witch
works
wutz
had
confided
his
plans
and
intentions
to
ruggedo
on
the
ride
up
say
exclaimed
the
gnome
king
suddenly
how
did
you
get
glinda
record
book
that
the
most
important
treasure
in
her
castle
of
course
lazily
the
wizard
reached
for
his
silver
pipe
well
a
long
story
rug
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
have
agents
working
in
every
kingdom
of
the
country
seven
who
was
assigned
to
the
quadling
country
brought
in
the
record
book
smallifying
it
in
order
to
steal
and
carry
it
here
and
restoring
it
to
proper
size
when
it
arrived
six
and
eleven
have
brought
me
useful
magic
from
the
winkies
and
gillikins
but
five
managed
to
steal
ozma
own
magic
picture
and
ha
ha
since
he
could
find
the
gnome
king
belt
he
brought
me
the
gnome
king
himself
pretty
clever
of
him
to
discover
you
were
a
jug
eh
sighed
ruggedo
as
wutz
paused
to
blow
a
silver
bubble
which
floated
out
of
the
work
den
breaking
somewhere
outside
with
a
tinkling
explosion
two
glasses
of
melted
silver
snapped
the
wizard
to
a
smart
looking
bell
boy
who
came
in
answer
to
this
singular
summons
now
continued
wutz
looking
at
the
gnome
king
through
half
closed
eyes
before
i
attempt
to
capture
the
emerald
city
i
must
have
one
of
two
things
either
the
silver
hammer
belonging
to
a
witch
of
the
west
or
the
magic
belt
that
once
belonged
to
you
so
far
none
of
my
agents
has
been
able
to
find
the
witch
locate
the
hammer
or
discover
where
ozma
now
keeps
your
magic
belt
but
you
its
rightful
owner
must
know
exactly
where
it
is
hidden
ruggedo
without
saying
anything
nodded
briefly
well
then
said
wutz
if
you
will
help
me
steal
the
magic
belt
which
i
understand
is
the
most
potent
and
powerful
magic
in
ev
or
oz
i
will
kick
kaliko
off
your
throne
restore
your
own
kingdom
and
give
you
besides
any
one
of
the
four
oz
kingdoms
you
may
fancy
oh
do
bother
me
with
any
of
the
oz
kingdoms
i
sick
of
the
place
frowned
the
gnome
wagging
his
beard
vindictively
all
i
want
is
my
own
old
kingdom
and
my
own
magic
belt
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
help
you
steal
this
belt
for
i
know
exactly
where
it
is
hidden
show
you
how
it
works
so
you
can
transform
ozma
and
all
her
friends
and
counselors
to
rocks
and
rubble
but
when
you
are
safely
established
as
supreme
wizard
of
oz
you
must
return
the
belt
to
me
oh
naturally
promised
the
wizard
chuckling
to
himself
as
he
thought
how
quickly
he
would
turn
ruggedo
to
a
rock
once
he
was
wearing
the
famous
belt
taking
a
glass
of
melted
silver
from
the
tray
the
boy
had
just
set
down
wutz
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
ruggedo
his
eyes
glittering
with
all
their
old
spitefulness
raised
his
own
glass
to
drink
to
the
wicked
bargain
come
he
sputtered
wiping
his
mouth
on
the
back
of
his
hand
when
do
we
start
what
magic
have
you
to
carry
us
to
the
capital
and
open
the
emerald
safe
where
the
magic
belt
and
other
important
treasures
of
ozma
are
hidden
but
wait
perhaps
we
had
better
look
in
the
magic
picture
and
see
where
ozma
and
the
wizard
of
oz
are
now
i
am
afraid
we
can
not
do
that
wutz
explained
regretfully
seven
spoiled
the
canvas
in
some
way
when
he
reduced
it
to
carry
it
here
it
does
show
anything
now
and
i
not
had
time
to
repair
the
damage
pshaw
that
too
bad
said
ruggedo
going
over
to
touch
the
picture
now
hanging
on
the
wizard
wall
but
the
record
book
still
working
i
suppose
oh
yes
said
the
wizard
stepping
up
to
the
marble
table
and
glancing
down
at
the
open
page
and
listen
to
this
it
says
roared
the
silver
king
holding
his
sides
and
simply
rocking
with
wicked
merriment
it
says
two
metal
monarchs
are
plotting
the
downfall
of
the
present
ruler
of
oz
what
else
does
it
say
inquired
the
gnome
king
who
had
had
more
experience
than
his
companion
in
dealing
with
the
magicians
of
the
emerald
city
it
says
and
her
counselors
have
gone
to
the
castle
of
glinda
the
good
wutz
told
him
complacently
closing
and
padlocking
the
big
volume
then
we
better
start
at
once
and
before
they
return
declared
ruggedo
for
as
soon
as
we
have
my
belt
we
can
change
them
to
rocks
wherever
they
are
the
most
important
thing
is
to
get
that
belt
before
they
know
we
are
after
it
but
how
are
we
going
to
get
to
the
emerald
city
and
how
we
going
to
open
that
safe
my
silver
blowpipe
will
reduce
the
safe
to
a
heap
of
ashes
without
injuring
the
contents
answered
the
wizard
and
reaching
the
capital
will
be
the
simplest
part
of
all
taking
a
silver
tube
from
a
high
shelf
wutz
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
reaching
for
his
bubble
pipe
he
began
to
blow
an
enormous
quicksilver
bubble
round
himself
and
the
gnome
king
slowly
and
with
both
kings
inside
the
bubble
rose
passed
in
a
silver
mist
out
of
the
den
up
through
the
honeycomb
of
caves
caverns
and
grottos
on
up
and
up
till
it
floated
right
out
of
the
top
of
the
silver
king
mountain
chapter
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
at
the
same
moment
the
silver
bubble
carrying
wutz
and
ruggedo
burst
out
of
the
top
of
the
mountain
handy
mandy
and
nox
reached
the
bottom
arriving
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
winding
stair
one
amethyst
burned
dimly
on
the
small
landing
and
crowded
uncomfortably
together
the
two
prisoners
found
themselves
facing
a
heavily
barred
door
private
lower
of
the
wizard
of
wutz
keep
out
announced
a
surly
sign
but
handy
and
nox
their
legs
still
quivering
from
the
long
downward
climb
were
in
no
humor
to
be
stopped
by
a
sign
lower
sniffed
handy
mandy
disgustedly
i
should
think
it
was
we
must
be
at
the
very
bottom
of
this
miserable
mountain
lower
indeed
well
i
expect
a
lower
is
the
opposite
of
a
tower
come
on
picking
up
the
silver
ball
handy
squinted
sharply
at
the
door
giving
it
a
quick
shove
to
see
whether
it
was
locked
or
fitted
with
an
invisible
moving
panel
but
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
this
door
and
nothing
on
it
except
a
very
small
silver
keyhole
which
at
once
recalled
to
the
goat
girl
the
key
she
had
been
carrying
around
ever
since
she
left
keretaria
oh
nox
i
believe
the
key
in
your
horn
will
fit
she
cried
excitedly
and
deftly
removing
the
left
prong
of
nox
headgear
she
shook
out
the
ball
then
while
nox
fairly
panting
with
impatience
looked
on
handy
took
the
key
from
the
ball
and
inserted
it
in
the
silver
lock
when
it
turned
easily
and
smoothly
she
was
almost
afraid
to
open
the
door
what
would
they
find
on
the
other
side
what
had
the
wizard
done
to
his
helpless
young
captive
as
handy
hesitated
nox
rushed
forward
banging
the
door
open
with
his
great
shoulder
kerry
kerry
wailed
the
faithful
ox
and
falling
to
his
knees
nox
began
to
snort
and
blubber
in
real
earnest
handy
hurrying
after
him
into
the
small
stuffy
cell
saw
a
handsome
boy
in
hunting
costume
standing
motionless
and
silent
as
a
statue
in
the
center
of
a
great
shimmering
violet
bubble
without
thinking
or
reasoning
or
even
stopping
to
consult
the
ox
the
goat
girl
flung
out
all
her
arms
toward
the
solitary
figure
her
iron
hand
puncturing
the
bubble
with
a
deafening
pop
why
hello
nox
the
little
king
stepped
calmly
out
of
the
misty
vapor
all
that
was
left
of
the
wizard
bubble
where
your
other
horn
and
who
is
this
jolly
looking
girl
who
indeed
there
was
so
much
to
be
told
and
explained
even
with
handy
and
nox
talking
as
fast
as
they
could
and
taking
turns
it
took
almost
an
hour
to
tell
the
story
of
their
journey
from
keretaria
to
the
silver
mountain
and
their
awful
experiences
with
the
wizard
of
wutz
kerry
himself
remembered
nothing
since
he
had
started
out
on
the
hunting
expedition
he
listened
with
angry
exclamations
and
bounces
as
nox
related
the
tale
of
king
kerr
treachery
and
the
sad
state
of
affairs
in
keretaria
and
i
been
shut
up
in
this
bubble
for
two
years
mourned
the
little
king
looking
round
the
dismal
cell
with
a
shudder
why
it
makes
my
head
ache
just
to
think
of
it
mine
too
agreed
handy
clapping
nox
left
horn
in
place
but
it
almost
over
now
my
lad
if
we
can
just
find
some
way
out
of
this
mountain
i
settle
old
king
kerr
and
his
high
boys
not
to
speak
of
this
woozling
wizard
placing
kerry
on
nox
back
handy
looked
nervously
out
the
door
of
the
lower
at
sight
of
the
winding
stair
nox
gave
a
great
groan
and
shudder
i
never
climb
those
steps
again
he
declared
planting
his
feet
stubbornly
never
where
that
silver
hammer
give
it
a
tap
and
see
what
the
dwarf
can
do
for
us
wutz
and
ruggedo
are
too
busy
with
their
wicked
plans
to
bother
us
now
i
would
be
too
sure
of
that
muttered
the
goat
girl
nevertheless
she
pulled
out
the
hammer
and
tapped
it
lightly
on
the
floor
well
what
wanted
yawned
himself
appearing
instantly
and
in
the
exact
spot
the
hammer
had
struck
we
want
to
get
out
of
here
cried
kerry
so
excited
and
delighted
with
the
purple
bearded
dwarf
he
instantly
forgot
all
his
troubles
with
a
crooked
smile
at
the
little
king
himself
looked
questioningly
at
handy
and
at
the
goat
girl
quick
nod
rapped
his
knuckles
on
the
north
wall
of
the
lower
at
once
a
small
panel
slipped
aside
revealing
an
elevator
its
door
invitingly
open
waving
all
her
hands
to
thank
himself
who
was
already
beginning
to
disappear
handy
stepped
inside
nox
with
kerry
still
perched
on
his
back
just
managed
to
squeeze
in
when
the
door
snapped
shut
and
the
elevator
sped
upward
carrying
its
three
passengers
in
double
quicksilver
time
to
the
work
den
of
the
wizard
handy
a
bit
disappointed
not
to
find
herself
on
top
of
the
mountain
stepped
out
first
as
nox
with
an
awkward
jump
followed
her
the
door
slammed
sharply
and
the
elevator
dropped
like
a
plummet
to
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
oh
this
must
be
where
wutz
works
all
his
magic
transformations
breathed
kerry
sliding
off
nox
back
and
gazing
around
with
deep
interest
and
curiosity
i
bet
he
blew
a
bubble
round
me
right
in
this
very
den
wonder
where
he
is
now
there
was
a
slight
cough
at
kerry
question
and
turning
they
saw
nifflepok
standing
uncertainly
in
the
doorway
ah
so
we
meet
again
cried
handy
doubling
up
all
her
fists
and
walking
grimly
toward
the
silver
king
fat
minister
where
is
that
rascally
master
of
yours
as
you
probably
know
by
this
time
we
kept
our
part
of
the
bargain
but
he
still
has
to
keep
his
indeed
you
are
fortunate
to
have
escaped
with
your
lives
muttered
wutz
taking
off
his
hat
and
looking
anxiously
inside
and
i
sorry
to
tell
you
the
wizard
of
wutz
never
keeps
his
bargains
no
matter
how
hard
we
work
or
try
to
please
him
sooner
or
later
we
are
all
shelved
or
potted
then
why
work
for
such
a
villain
snorted
the
royal
ox
gruffly
where
is
he
now
yes
where
is
he
now
asked
kerry
who
in
spite
of
the
terrible
stories
he
had
heard
hoped
to
get
a
look
at
the
wonderful
wizard
who
had
enchanted
him
gone
answer
nifflepok
putting
on
his
high
hat
and
giving
it
a
couple
of
taps
he
bubbled
off
with
the
gnome
king
to
conquer
oz
and
i
expect
by
this
time
they
bewitched
about
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
emerald
city
oh
what
a
shame
burst
out
kerry
bubbled
off
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
goat
girl
reached
out
with
all
her
arms
to
pull
the
silver
king
little
minister
closer
i
mean
bubbled
off
repeated
nifflepok
struggling
to
release
himself
from
handy
clutches
he
blew
a
quicksilver
bubble
and
he
and
ruggedo
sailed
away
in
it
if
that
any
plainer
oh
then
we
had
better
go
right
after
them
snorted
the
ox
in
an
anxious
voice
show
us
out
of
this
mountain
you
little
pudding
or
i
toss
you
higher
than
a
kite
oh
do
let
do
something
begged
kerry
who
being
young
was
quite
daring
and
absolutely
foolhardy
we
are
going
to
let
those
dreadful
kings
conquer
the
country
are
we
and
not
lift
a
hand
well
i
sure
i
lift
all
seven
if
it
would
do
any
good
mused
handy
mandy
in
a
depressed
voice
but
how
can
we
stop
them
wutz
and
rug
have
probably
stolen
all
the
magic
in
ozma
palace
by
this
time
the
thieving
rascals
but
surely
you
have
some
magic
ventured
nifflepok
who
had
finally
jerked
himself
free
or
you
could
never
have
disenchanted
that
gnome
or
found
the
wizard
lower
and
rescued
this
boy
and
if
you
have
he
warned
backing
rapidly
away
if
you
have
you
better
use
it
quick
when
wutz
finishes
conquering
oz
he
sure
to
remember
you
and
turn
you
to
rocks
and
rubble
he
going
to
turn
everyone
to
rocks
and
rubble
wailed
nifflepok
dashing
out
of
the
workshop
great
gazoo
what
shall
we
do
i
do
want
to
be
a
rock
snorted
nox
and
i
wo
be
a
rock
stormed
the
little
king
it
was
bad
enough
being
shut
up
in
a
bubble
and
missing
two
whole
years
oh
you
let
him
turn
us
to
rocks
will
you
handy
and
do
let
help
poor
ozma
before
it
too
late
kerry
looked
up
at
her
so
pleadingly
handy
against
all
her
inclinations
and
better
judgment
pulled
out
the
silver
hammer
again
the
hammer
will
be
better
than
the
ball
she
reasoned
quickly
for
the
ball
only
seems
to
help
keretarians
now
then
lifting
the
hammer
in
her
iron
hand
the
goat
girl
brought
it
down
sharply
on
the
marble
table
silver
sparks
flew
up
in
every
direction
and
out
of
the
very
middle
of
the
shower
stepped
the
yawning
dwarf
say
i
trying
to
take
a
nap
grumbled
himself
stretching
his
arms
up
sleepily
what
do
you
fellows
want
now
we
want
to
go
to
the
emerald
city
of
oz
and
save
ozma
from
wutz
and
the
gnome
king
explained
handy
in
one
breathless
sentence
my
all
that
stifling
another
yawn
himself
grinned
mischievously
at
the
goat
girl
then
stand
in
line
please
so
handy
placed
herself
in
front
of
the
royal
ox
and
kerry
stepped
behind
him
and
the
dwarf
seizing
the
hammer
brought
it
down
with
a
terrible
blow
just
behind
the
little
king
and
what
a
blow
it
was
you
can
readily
understand
when
i
tell
you
that
its
force
carried
the
three
travelers
clear
out
of
the
silver
king
mountain
and
all
the
way
to
the
emerald
city
itself
flying
along
for
a
moment
beside
them
himself
slipped
the
hammer
back
in
the
goat
girl
hand
and
then
with
another
tremendous
yawn
disappeared
chapter
just
in
time
in
ozma
palace
in
the
emerald
city
everything
was
very
quiet
and
still
not
surprising
when
you
consider
that
the
wizard
of
wutz
had
blown
his
patent
stupefying
powder
down
all
the
chimneys
before
he
and
ruggedo
dared
to
enter
then
mooring
the
silver
bubble
to
one
of
the
castle
spires
the
two
conspirators
had
slipped
through
an
open
window
and
proceeded
without
delay
or
interference
to
the
private
sitting
room
of
the
absent
ruler
there
ruggedo
with
a
spiteful
laugh
thrust
his
head
right
into
the
mouths
of
the
hungry
tiger
and
cowardly
lion
rigid
and
helpless
they
sat
before
ozma
safe
motionless
and
completely
stupefied
as
were
all
of
ozma
other
faithful
servants
and
retainers
reducing
the
safe
to
a
heap
of
green
ashes
was
the
work
of
but
a
moment
then
pulling
the
gnome
king
belt
from
the
sparkling
heap
of
treasures
wutz
sprang
to
his
feet
quick
how
does
it
work
he
cried
clasping
the
belt
round
his
thin
waist
we
not
have
a
second
safety
till
ozma
glinda
the
wizard
of
oz
and
all
those
girl
princesses
are
out
of
the
way
but
first
you
must
restore
my
kingdom
insisted
ruggedo
dancing
up
and
down
here
give
it
to
me
i
used
to
it
and
can
work
faster
first
i
wish
kaliko
off
my
throne
and
myself
back
in
my
underground
castle
then
oh
no
you
wo
declared
wutz
holding
the
bouncing
gnome
king
off
with
one
hand
how
do
i
know
what
you
will
do
once
you
reach
your
own
kingdom
why
i
might
never
see
this
belt
again
but
i
promise
to
send
it
back
to
you
hissed
ruggedo
his
eyes
snapping
real
sparks
i
rather
have
the
belt
than
the
promise
said
wutz
shaking
his
head
stubbornly
give
it
to
me
i
say
give
it
to
me
yelled
ruggedo
now
in
a
perfect
rage
how
do
i
know
what
you
will
do
when
you
know
the
trick
of
using
it
why
you
might
even
turn
me
to
a
rock
to
be
rid
of
me
what
change
my
dearest
friend
and
most
powerful
ally
to
a
rock
exclaimed
the
wizard
with
pretended
horror
by
the
left
horn
of
my
silver
cow
i
promise
to
return
this
belt
as
soon
as
i
am
ruler
of
oz
ruggedo
longed
to
snatch
his
belt
away
from
the
scheming
silver
monarch
but
as
he
was
neither
big
or
strong
enough
to
do
this
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
agree
to
the
wizard
terms
all
right
he
groaned
dismally
listen
then
but
as
wutz
bent
his
head
and
the
little
gnome
began
to
whisper
hoarse
directions
in
his
ear
there
was
a
dreadful
thump
and
clatter
behind
them
stop
commanded
the
goat
girl
the
first
to
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
landing
and
dear
knows
handy
should
have
been
used
to
sudden
landings
by
this
time
stop
whirling
round
with
a
howl
of
fury
wutz
sprang
straight
at
her
but
handy
who
still
clutched
the
silver
hammer
in
her
iron
hand
was
too
quick
for
him
and
brought
it
down
with
a
resounding
crack
on
the
top
of
his
head
take
away
take
away
cried
handy
hysterically
as
wutz
fell
over
backwards
and
himself
appearing
exactly
where
the
hammer
had
struck
leaped
off
the
wizard
head
to
save
himself
from
a
fall
but
first
we
must
have
that
magic
belt
chuckled
the
hammer
elf
giving
ruggedo
who
was
struggling
frantically
to
get
his
belt
from
around
the
silver
king
waist
a
quick
push
himself
unbuckled
the
clasps
and
tossed
the
magic
girdle
to
the
goat
girl
then
grabbing
the
howling
gnome
and
senseless
wizard
each
by
his
neck
the
efficient
dwarf
vanished
in
a
flash
of
lightning
and
a
crash
of
thunder
that
shook
the
castle
to
its
foundations
nox
dropped
to
his
knees
kerry
still
stunned
by
the
hammer
blow
that
had
carried
them
to
the
emerald
city
and
handy
herself
with
her
arms
still
upraised
stared
in
dumb
astonishment
at
the
quivering
vacuum
where
the
two
kings
and
himself
the
elf
had
been
whirling
a
moment
before
oh
handy
handy
you
really
done
it
shouted
kerry
finding
his
voice
at
last
why
you
saved
the
whole
of
ozma
kingdom
and
struck
only
one
blow
but
watch
out
are
those
beasts
alive
or
just
statues
statues
i
hope
grunted
the
royal
ox
lurching
dizzily
to
his
feet
well
here
we
are
in
the
capital
and
i
must
say
you
have
handled
everything
beautifully
beautifully
halt
who
goes
there
whoa
ho
halt
and
surrender
piped
a
frightened
voice
here
they
are
your
majesty
the
robbers
themselves
caught
in
the
act
of
robbing
our
royal
safe
red
white
and
blue
handed
if
you
ask
me
cried
the
patchwork
girl
blinking
her
shoe
button
eyes
at
the
red
rubber
hand
with
which
handy
grasped
the
gnome
king
belt
the
white
hand
she
had
reached
out
to
hold
on
to
kerry
the
iron
hand
still
clutching
the
silver
hammer
all
the
rest
of
her
hands
the
goat
girl
held
stiffly
before
her
brushing
aside
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
who
promptly
dived
behind
a
sofa
scraps
jerked
the
gnome
king
belt
out
of
rubber
hand
and
gave
her
a
shove
that
sent
her
flying
over
backwards
take
that
you
monster
yelled
scraps
well
sputtered
the
goat
girl
sprawling
flat
on
her
back
gratitude
for
you
how
dare
you
call
handy
a
monster
bellowed
nox
charging
angrily
after
the
patchwork
girl
oh
do
be
careful
called
ozma
with
a
little
scream
as
nox
almost
caught
up
with
scraps
and
kerry
began
to
belabor
the
soldier
with
green
whiskers
over
the
head
with
a
candlestick
oh
oh
my
poor
lion
my
poor
tiger
my
safe
why
i
just
ca
believe
it
wailed
the
little
fairy
ruler
staring
sorrowfully
down
at
the
goat
girl
who
had
made
no
attempt
to
rise
nor
explain
her
embarrassing
position
then
do
believe
it
cried
kerry
breathlessly
for
it
true
this
brave
girl
and
nox
have
got
the
best
of
wutz
and
the
gnome
king
and
saved
your
whole
bally
kingdom
and
here
you
gone
and
had
her
knocked
down
shame
on
you
get
away
from
me
you
cotton
stuffed
horror
screamed
the
little
king
as
scraps
eluding
the
ox
made
a
determined
jump
in
his
direction
quiet
quiet
the
scarecrow
who
with
glinda
the
wizard
dorothy
betsy
and
trot
now
came
hurrying
into
the
room
raised
both
arms
and
looked
around
pleadingly
the
whole
royal
party
traveling
in
swan
chariot
had
just
arrived
on
the
balcony
outside
but
ozma
scraps
and
the
soldier
with
green
whiskers
had
been
first
on
the
scene
of
action
the
boy
is
right
declared
glinda
crossing
slowly
to
a
green
sofa
i
can
see
by
her
face
and
hands
glinda
smiled
faintly
that
this
girl
is
both
honest
and
industrious
thanks
murmured
handy
as
the
scarecrow
ever
a
gentleman
bounded
forward
to
assist
her
to
her
feet
the
flimsy
straw
stuffed
fellow
lost
his
balance
in
the
attempt
but
his
little
act
of
gallantry
did
much
to
relieve
an
awkward
moment
you
see
puffed
the
scarecrow
seating
handy
with
a
flourish
for
the
last
ten
days
we
all
been
pretty
much
upset
around
here
and
you
have
to
excuse
scraps
for
jumping
at
conclusions
please
do
ozma
spoke
pleasantly
and
seriously
as
she
seated
herself
in
her
small
arm
chair
leaning
over
to
take
the
gnome
king
belt
from
scraps
but
if
some
of
you
kind
people
will
just
explain
the
little
fairy
looked
anxiously
from
the
stupefied
tiger
and
lion
to
her
pulverized
safe
her
eyes
coming
back
to
rest
on
the
goat
girl
the
great
white
ox
and
the
handsome
young
munchkin
chapter
the
hammer
elf
explains
go
ahead
and
explain
said
handy
closing
her
eyes
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
all
her
hands
hanging
limply
at
her
side
so
nox
a
bit
haughtily
and
tossing
his
head
proudly
from
time
to
time
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
all
that
had
happened
since
handy
mandy
had
flown
from
mt
mern
how
the
goat
girl
had
found
the
magic
in
his
horn
how
they
had
traveled
together
from
keretaria
to
the
silver
mountain
and
there
in
their
search
for
the
little
king
discovered
wutz
plot
to
make
himself
supreme
wizard
of
oz
and
last
of
all
he
explained
how
handy
with
the
help
of
the
silver
hammer
had
subdued
the
two
wicked
kings
well
it
certainly
was
very
kind
of
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
for
us
after
you
had
already
had
so
many
worries
of
your
own
sighed
ozma
as
nox
finishing
his
story
gazed
round
the
room
with
lordly
condescension
yes
was
it
handy
opened
her
eyes
and
thoughtfully
regarded
the
little
ruler
of
oz
still
i
glad
now
that
we
did
save
you
the
goat
girl
round
pleasant
face
was
suddenly
wreathed
in
smiles
i
did
think
i
was
going
to
like
you
but
i
do
she
admitted
cheerfully
i
believe
you
about
the
best
ruler
oz
could
have
and
besides
you
pretty
as
a
goat
as
a
goat
gasped
the
wizard
of
oz
while
dorothy
and
the
other
girls
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
from
laughing
right
out
loud
but
ozma
who
was
a
very
understanding
little
person
smiled
kindly
back
at
handy
mandy
goats
pretty
she
agreed
nodding
her
head
politely
and
since
you
must
miss
your
own
goats
very
much
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
send
you
back
to
mt
mern
after
you
seen
a
bit
of
the
capital
oh
handy
would
leave
us
snorted
the
royal
ox
moving
as
close
to
the
goat
girl
as
he
could
get
we
could
get
along
without
handy
mandy
your
majesty
oh
please
let
her
stay
in
keretaria
begged
the
little
king
adding
his
voice
to
that
of
his
royal
ox
you
will
live
with
us
in
the
palace
wo
you
handy
well
if
i
just
had
my
goats
considered
the
maiden
mt
mern
would
seem
rather
dull
after
oz
she
acknowledged
pensively
but
what
about
that
old
king
who
still
on
kerry
throne
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
silver
hammer
and
what
do
you
suppose
himself
has
done
with
wutz
and
ruggedo
yes
what
to
be
done
with
wutz
echoed
the
scarecrow
wrinkling
up
his
cotton
forehead
and
now
the
little
sitting
room
began
fairly
to
buzz
with
excited
questions
and
suggestions
for
there
was
still
a
lot
to
be
explained
and
settled
the
ozites
could
hardly
keep
their
eyes
off
the
goat
girl
the
handsome
young
ruler
of
keretaria
and
his
royal
ox
dorothy
longed
to
unscrew
his
horn
and
test
its
magic
power
for
herself
but
ozma
anxious
to
repair
all
the
damage
done
by
the
wicked
wizard
now
raised
her
scepter
for
silence
clasping
on
the
gnome
king
belt
ozma
first
brought
back
her
magic
picture
and
with
a
quick
wish
returned
glinda
book
of
records
to
her
castle
in
the
south
next
though
she
knew
neither
the
extent
nor
the
nature
of
the
wizard
other
thefts
she
caused
to
be
restored
to
their
rightful
owners
all
the
magic
appliances
in
the
silver
king
den
the
scarecrow
had
already
reported
the
stupefied
condition
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
palace
so
ozma
next
thought
was
to
restore
them
to
their
accustomed
selves
no
sooner
was
the
cowardly
lion
released
than
he
crawled
under
a
table
but
the
hungry
tiger
rushed
out
on
the
balcony
growling
and
lashing
his
tail
as
he
thought
of
the
indignity
he
had
suffered
after
a
short
conference
with
handy
mandy
ozma
freed
all
the
potted
prisoners
of
the
wicked
wizard
and
made
nifflepok
king
of
the
silver
mountain
she
moved
the
cliff
dwellings
of
the
people
to
the
outside
of
the
mountain
so
wutz
pale
subjects
could
enjoy
with
the
rest
of
the
gillikins
the
bright
sunshine
and
beneficent
climate
of
oz
the
magic
mountain
itself
with
all
its
dark
pits
and
jeweled
caverns
ozma
sealed
up
tightly
and
forever
the
wizard
agents
were
turned
to
moles
for
they
were
already
more
like
these
boring
little
animals
than
men
after
each
magic
wish
or
transformation
the
little
group
in
the
royal
sitting
room
would
look
in
the
magic
picture
which
ozma
had
immediately
repaired
and
in
each
case
handy
felt
that
the
ruler
of
oz
had
used
both
wisdom
and
good
judgment
nox
as
they
were
watching
the
wizard
agents
turn
to
moles
gave
a
snort
of
surprise
for
the
first
figure
shown
was
old
king
kerr
who
was
really
number
nine
as
the
wicked
impostor
changed
quickly
from
a
man
to
a
mole
and
scurried
off
the
throne
and
away
to
bury
himself
in
the
blue
forest
nox
and
handy
both
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
satisfaction
while
ozma
was
working
on
the
magic
safe
handy
deciding
to
try
a
little
of
her
own
magic
softly
tapped
the
silver
hammer
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
at
once
and
to
the
delight
and
interest
of
everyone
himself
the
elf
appeared
astride
the
arm
holding
a
small
cactus
plant
in
each
hand
i
wish
you
in
the
future
to
obey
the
summons
of
her
majesty
ozma
of
oz
smiled
the
goat
girl
placing
the
silver
hammer
as
she
spoke
in
ozma
lap
this
young
fairy
is
more
experienced
in
magic
than
i
and
will
know
how
to
use
the
hammer
to
best
advantage
oh
all
right
but
i
rather
liked
working
for
you
grinned
himself
and
say
i
tried
to
turn
these
rascals
to
plants
but
this
was
the
best
i
could
do
setting
the
two
pots
of
cactus
down
on
a
small
writing
desk
the
hammer
elf
bowed
first
to
handy
and
then
to
ozma
wait
do
go
begged
the
little
fairy
as
himself
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
disappearing
do
tell
us
about
this
silver
hammer
and
who
owned
it
first
it
belonged
to
wunchie
a
witch
of
the
west
who
lived
in
the
munchkin
mountains
for
about
a
thousand
years
and
used
it
to
control
as
many
of
the
munchkin
kings
as
she
could
explained
the
dwarf
balancing
himself
cleverly
on
an
ink
well
then
i
suppose
wunchie
was
responsible
for
the
prophecy
in
keretaria
surmised
nox
blinking
his
eyes
at
the
hammer
elf
the
dwarf
nodded
cheerfully
yes
wunchie
invented
that
prophecy
he
told
them
and
placed
her
own
white
oxen
in
the
country
each
time
she
had
trouble
forcing
the
king
to
do
as
she
wished
she
tapped
him
and
the
ox
on
the
head
with
her
hammer
but
i
took
rather
a
fancy
to
you
admitted
himself
looking
fondly
at
nox
so
when
she
ordered
me
to
tap
you
off
and
traded
little
king
kerry
to
wutz
for
a
basket
of
jumping
beans
and
put
wutz
agent
on
the
throne
of
keretaria
i
decided
to
take
a
hand
myself
so
i
gave
you
only
a
light
tap
and
at
the
same
time
i
stored
enough
magic
in
your
horns
to
help
you
find
kerry
and
with
the
help
of
this
handy
goat
girl
you
did
find
him
beamed
the
hammer
elf
i
knew
my
magic
was
good
you
ca
work
for
a
witch
without
learning
good
magic
but
now
since
everything
is
turning
out
so
splendidly
just
go
back
to
my
tree
stump
one
two
three
back
to
my
tree
but
what
became
of
the
witch
cried
ozma
catching
hold
of
the
purple
beard
for
his
head
had
already
vanished
ha
ha
she
exploded
and
popped
off
roared
a
voice
from
the
place
where
the
elf
head
had
been
i
told
her
not
to
eat
those
jumping
beans
and
after
that
i
buried
her
hammer
in
the
garden
of
keretaria
and
there
it
stayed
till
handy
ploughed
it
up
goodbye
all
and
the
body
of
the
hammer
elf
melted
into
nothing
and
was
gone
my
y
what
a
clever
fellow
chuckled
handy
so
now
wutz
and
ruggedo
are
a
couple
of
cactuses
mm
mmm
mmmm
mm
unpleasant
to
the
last
do
you
suppose
anyone
can
ever
disenchant
them
for
goatness
sake
be
careful
begged
handy
as
jellia
in
answer
to
her
ring
came
to
carry
the
plants
to
the
conservatory
whatever
you
do
do
drop
and
to
think
that
the
wizard
is
potted
himself
well
i
never
have
a
hand
in
breaking
his
enchantment
i
never
thought
anyone
could
ever
break
ruggedo
enchantment
confessed
ozma
when
i
changed
him
to
a
jug
i
commanded
him
to
keep
that
shape
till
he
was
broken
by
the
seventh
hand
of
a
traveling
mernite
and
at
that
time
i
did
not
even
know
there
was
such
a
place
as
mt
mern
or
a
clever
goat
girl
like
handy
but
are
you
glad
there
was
shouted
the
little
wizard
of
oz
tossing
up
his
hat
and
catching
it
on
his
nose
are
we
all
glad
to
know
handy
mandy
nox
and
this
jolly
young
king
long
live
the
royal
ox
and
the
little
king
of
keretaria
cried
the
cheering
ozites
long
live
handy
mandy
the
wonder
of
the
world
and
oz
and
of
course
they
will
live
long
everyone
lives
long
in
oz
but
even
if
handy
lives
to
be
a
hundred
she
will
never
forget
the
grand
banquet
given
that
evening
in
her
honor
besides
the
famous
people
she
already
knew
the
goat
girl
was
presented
to
all
the
other
celebrities
at
ozma
court
and
shaking
hands
with
them
heartily
and
seven
at
a
time
she
had
never
been
so
flattered
and
fussed
over
in
her
life
nox
and
kerry
came
in
for
their
share
of
honors
too
there
was
nothing
the
ozians
would
not
have
done
for
their
three
new
friends
and
rescuers
ozma
overwhelmed
by
handy
generosity
in
giving
her
the
silver
hammer
and
already
indebted
to
her
for
saving
the
kingdom
racked
her
brains
for
some
wonderful
gift
to
reward
the
brave
mountain
lass
but
it
was
nox
who
solved
the
difficulty
by
confiding
to
ozma
that
handy
desired
more
than
anything
else
a
set
of
gloves
for
her
hands
it
seemed
she
had
never
had
enough
gloves
for
more
than
two
at
a
time
so
smiling
secretly
to
herself
ozma
gave
the
goat
girl
seven
sets
of
fine
kid
gloves
and
an
emerald
necklace
that
wound
three
times
round
her
sturdy
neck
with
the
necklace
a
complete
new
outfit
and
her
gloves
handy
mandy
felt
herself
quite
ready
for
high
life
and
royal
society
though
you
really
should
wear
a
boxing
glove
on
that
iron
hand
whispered
the
scarecrow
as
handy
blushingly
resumed
her
seat
after
ozma
speech
of
presentation
stay
in
the
emerald
city
and
we
will
make
you
a
general
in
the
army
promised
the
straw
man
earnestly
but
handy
shook
her
head
with
tears
of
merriment
in
her
eyes
though
she
never
quite
forgave
scraps
for
pushing
her
over
she
and
the
scarecrow
were
already
as
friendly
and
easy
as
an
old
pair
of
shoes
handy
monday

thursday
friday
saturday
and
sunday
the
straw
man
had
nicknamed
her
because
she
had
a
hand
for
every
day
in
the
week
nox
had
insisted
on
himself
being
invited
to
the
banquet
and
the
clever
elf
added
much
to
the
pleasure
and
hilarity
of
that
memorable
occasion
indeed
many
times
afterward
when
she
felt
bored
or
lonely
ozma
would
summon
himself
just
to
amuse
and
cheer
her
up
the
silver
hammer
was
stored
away
with
the
other
important
magic
treasures
and
is
regarded
by
many
as
the
most
powerful
magic
in
the
castle
handy
mandy
kept
the
blue
flower
to
help
her
on
future
journeys
and
after
she
and
her
two
friends
had
spent
a
happy
week
in
the
emerald
city
ozma
reluctantly
wished
kerry
and
nox
to
keretaria
and
the
goat
girl
back
to
mt
mern
here
for
a
month
handy
mandy
astonished
the
villagers
with
the
story
of
her
travels
then
gathering
up
her
goats
she
took
herself
and
them
back
by
a
fast
wishing
pill
the
wizard
had
given
her
to
the
kingdom
of
keretaria
as
the
goat
girl
hands
retained
all
of
their
strength
and
willingness
and
nox
horns
all
their
magic
even
to
giving
wise
and
useful
messages
these
two
and
little
kerry
ruled
the
kingdom
between
them
with
such
skill
and
cleverness
everyone
was
enormously
happy
and
prosperous
