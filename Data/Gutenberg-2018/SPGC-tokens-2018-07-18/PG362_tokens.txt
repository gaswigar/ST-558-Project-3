calderwell
does
some
talking
calderwell
had
met
arkwright
in
london
through
a
common
friend
since
then
they
had
tramped
half
over
europe
together
in
a
comradeship
that
was
as
delightful
as
it
was
unusual
as
calderwell
put
it
in
a
letter
to
his
sister
belle
we
smoke
the
same
cigar
and
drink
the
same
tea
he
just
as
much
of
an
old
woman
on
that
subject
as
i
am
and
we
agree
beautifully
on
all
necessary
points
of
living
from
tipping
to
late
sleeping
in
the
morning
while
as
for
politics
and
religion
we
disagree
in
those
just
enough
to
lend
spice
to
an
otherwise
tame
farther
along
in
this
same
letter
calderwell
touched
upon
his
new
friend
again
i
admit
however
i
would
like
to
know
his
name
to
find
out
what
that
mysterious
j
stands
for
has
got
to
be
pretty
nearly
an
obsession
with
me
i
am
about
ready
to
pick
his
pocket
or
rifle
his
trunk
in
search
of
some
lurking
or
that
will
set
me
at
peace
as
it
is
i
confess
that
i
have
ogled
his
incoming
mail
and
his
outgoing
baggage
shamelessly
only
to
be
slapped
in
the
face
always
and
everlastingly
by
that
bland
j
i
got
my
revenge
now
though
to
myself
i
call
him
jane
and
his
six
feet
of
muscular
manhood
would
so
like
to
be
called
jane
by
the
way
belle
if
you
ever
hear
of
murder
and
sudden
death
in
my
direction
better
set
the
sleuths
on
the
trail
of
arkwright
six
to
one
you
find
i
called
him
jane
to
his
face
calderwell
was
thinking
of
that
letter
now
as
he
sat
at
a
small
table
in
a
paris
café
opposite
him
was
the
six
feet
of
muscular
manhood
broad
shoulders
pointed
brown
beard
and
all
and
he
had
just
addressed
it
inadvertently
as
mary
during
the
brief
sickening
moment
of
silence
after
the
name
had
left
his
lips
calderwell
was
conscious
of
a
whimsical
realization
of
the
lights
music
and
laughter
all
about
him
well
i
chose
as
safe
a
place
as
i
could
he
was
thinking
then
arkwright
spoke
how
long
since
you
been
in
correspondence
with
members
of
my
family
eh
arkwright
laughed
grimly
perhaps
you
thought
of
it
yourself
then
i
admit
you
capable
of
it
he
nodded
reaching
for
a
cigar
but
it
so
happens
you
hit
upon
my
family
favorite
name
for
jane
you
mean
they
actually
you
that
yes
bowed
the
big
fellow
calmly
as
he
struck
a
light
appropriate
do
you
think
calderwell
did
not
answer
he
thought
he
could
not
well
silence
gives
consent
they
say
laughed
the
other
anyhow
you
must
have
had
reason
for
calling
me
arkwright
what
j
stand
for
demanded
calderwell
oh
is
that
it
smiled
the
man
opposite
well
i
own
those
initials
have
been
something
of
a
puzzle
to
people
one
man
declares
they
jokes
but
another
not
so
friendly
says
they
stand
for
jealousy
of
more
fortunate
chaps
who
have
real
names
for
a
handle
my
small
brothers
and
sisters
discovering
with
the
usual
perspicacity
of
one
family
on
such
matters
that
i
never
signed
or
called
myself
anything
but
dubbed
me
jane
and
there
you
have
mary
jane
you
arkwright
smiled
oddly
oh
well
what
the
difference
would
you
deprive
them
of
their
innocent
amusement
and
they
do
so
love
that
jane
besides
what
in
a
name
anyway
he
went
on
eyeing
the
glowing
tip
of
the
cigar
between
his
fingers
rose
by
any
other
name
heard
that
probably
names
do
always
signify
my
dear
fellow
for
instance
i
know
a
but
he
a
calderwell
gave
a
sudden
start
you
do
mean
billy
neilson
the
other
turned
sharply
do
know
billy
neilson
calderwell
gave
his
friend
a
glance
from
scornful
eyes
do
i
know
billy
neilson
he
cried
does
a
fellow
usually
know
the
girl
he
proposed
to
regularly
once
in
three
months
oh
i
know
telling
tales
out
of
school
of
course
he
went
on
in
response
to
the
look
that
had
come
into
the
brown
eyes
opposite
but
what
the
use
everybody
knows
it
that
knows
us
billy
herself
got
so
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
refused
as
a
matter
of
course
too
just
as
she
would
refuse
a
serving
of
apple
pie
at
dinner
if
she
had
wanted
apple
pie
scouted
arkwright
calderwell
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
dear
fellow
you
do
seem
to
realize
it
but
for
the
last
six
months
you
have
been
assisting
at
the
obsequies
of
a
dead
indeed
and
is
it
buried
yet
oh
no
sighed
calderwell
cheerfully
i
shall
go
back
one
of
these
days
i
warrant
and
begin
the
same
old
game
again
though
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
last
refusal
was
so
very
decided
that
it
been
a
year
almost
since
i
received
it
i
think
i
was
really
convinced
for
a
while
that
that
she
did
want
that
apple
pie
he
finished
with
a
whimsical
lightness
that
did
not
quite
coincide
with
the
stern
lines
that
had
come
to
his
mouth
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
calderwell
spoke
again
where
did
you
know
miss
billy
oh
i
do
know
her
at
all
i
know
of
her
through
aunt
calderwell
sat
suddenly
erect
aunt
hannah
is
she
your
aunt
too
jove
this
a
little
old
world
after
all
is
it
she
is
my
aunt
she
my
mother
third
cousin
none
of
us
have
seen
her
for
years
but
she
writes
to
mother
occasionally
and
of
course
for
some
time
now
her
letters
have
been
running
over
full
of
billy
she
lives
with
her
i
believe
does
she
she
does
rejoined
calderwell
with
an
unexpected
chuckle
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
she
happened
to
live
with
her
at
why
no
i
reckon
not
what
do
you
mean
calderwell
chuckled
again
well
i
tell
you
you
being
a
jane
ought
to
appreciate
it
you
see
billy
was
named
for
one
william
henshaw
her
father
chum
who
promptly
forgot
all
about
her
at
eighteen
billy
being
left
quite
alone
in
the
world
wrote
to
william
and
asked
to
come
and
live
with
well
but
it
was
well
william
was
a
widower
who
lived
with
two
younger
brothers
an
old
butler
and
a
chinese
cook
in
one
of
those
funny
old
beacon
street
houses
in
boston
strata
bertram
called
it
bright
boy
bertram
the
strata
yes
i
wish
you
could
see
that
house
arkwright
it
a
regular
layer
cake
cyril
he
the
second
brother
must
be
or
five
now
lives
on
the
top
floor
in
a
rugless
curtainless
existence
just
a
plain
crank
below
him
comes
william
william
collects
things
everything
from
tenpenny
nails
to
teapots
i
should
say
and
they
all
there
in
his
rooms
farther
down
somewhere
comes
bertram
he
bertram
henshaw
you
understand
the
not
the
henshaw
the
same
only
of
course
four
years
ago
he
was
quite
so
well
known
as
he
is
now
well
to
resume
and
go
on
it
was
into
this
house
this
masculine
paradise
ruled
over
by
pete
and
dong
ling
in
the
kitchen
that
billy
naïve
request
for
a
home
great
scott
breathed
arkwright
appreciatively
yes
well
the
letter
was
signed
they
took
her
for
a
boy
naturally
and
after
something
of
a
struggle
they
agreed
to
let
come
for
his
particular
delectation
they
fixed
up
a
room
next
to
bertram
with
guns
and
fishing
rods
and
such
ladylike
specialties
and
william
went
to
the
station
to
meet
the
with
never
a
suspicion
with
never
a
gorry
well
came
and
conquered
i
guess
things
were
lively
for
a
while
though
oh
there
was
a
kitten
too
i
believe
who
added
to
the
gayety
of
but
what
did
the
henshaws
do
well
i
was
there
of
course
but
bertram
says
they
spun
around
like
tops
gone
mad
for
a
time
but
finally
quieted
down
enough
to
summon
a
married
sister
for
immediate
propriety
and
to
establish
aunt
hannah
for
permanency
the
next
so
that
how
it
happened
well
by
george
cried
arkwright
yes
nodded
the
other
so
you
see
there
are
untold
possibilities
just
in
a
name
remember
that
just
suppose
as
mary
jane
should
beg
a
home
in
a
feminine
household
say
in
miss
billy
for
instance
i
like
to
retorted
arkwright
with
sudden
warmth
calderwell
stared
a
little
the
other
laughed
shamefacedly
oh
it
only
that
i
happen
to
have
a
devouring
curiosity
to
meet
that
special
young
lady
i
sing
her
songs
you
know
she
written
some
dandies
i
heard
a
lot
about
her
and
i
seen
her
he
did
not
add
that
he
had
also
purloined
that
same
picture
from
his
mother
bureau
the
picture
being
a
gift
from
aunt
hannah
so
you
see
i
would
indeed
like
to
occupy
a
corner
in
the
fair
miss
household
i
could
write
to
aunt
hannah
and
beg
a
home
with
her
you
know
eh
of
course
why
do
you
jane
laughed
calderwell
take
you
all
right
she
had
a
little
miss
hawthorn
a
music
teacher
there
for
months
she
always
doing
stunts
of
that
sort
belle
writes
me
that
she
had
a
dozen
forlornites
there
all
this
last
summer
two
or
three
at
a
widows
lonesome
old
maids
and
crippled
kids
just
to
give
them
a
royal
good
time
so
you
see
she
take
you
without
a
doubt
jove
what
a
pair
you
make
miss
billy
and
mary
jane
you
drive
the
suffragettes
into
conniption
fits
just
by
the
sound
of
you
arkwright
laughed
quietly
then
he
frowned
but
how
about
it
he
asked
i
thought
she
was
keeping
house
with
aunt
hannah
did
she
stay
at
all
with
the
henshaws
oh
yes
a
few
months
i
never
knew
just
why
she
did
leave
but
i
fancied
from
something
billy
herself
said
once
that
she
discovered
she
was
creating
rather
too
much
of
an
upheaval
in
the
strata
so
she
took
herself
off
she
went
to
school
and
travelled
considerably
she
was
over
here
when
i
met
her
first
after
that
she
was
with
us
all
one
summer
on
the
yacht
a
couple
of
years
ago
or
so
she
went
back
to
boston
bought
a
house
and
settled
down
with
aunt
and
she
not
married
or
even
engaged
was
the
last
i
heard
i
have
seen
her
since
december
and
heard
from
her
only
indirectly
she
corresponds
with
my
sister
and
so
do
i
intermittently
i
heard
a
month
ago
from
belle
and
had
a
letter
from
billy
in
august
but
i
heard
nothing
of
any
how
about
the
henshaws
i
should
think
there
might
be
a
chance
there
for
a
romance
a
charming
girl
and
three
unattached
calderwell
gave
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
i
do
think
so
william
is
let
me
see
nearly
i
guess
by
this
time
and
he
is
a
marrying
man
he
buried
his
heart
with
his
wife
and
baby
years
ago
cyril
according
to
bertram
women
and
all
other
confusion
so
that
ought
to
let
him
out
as
for
bertram
himself
bertram
is
bertram
he
always
been
that
bertram
loves
girls
to
paint
but
i
ca
imagine
him
making
serious
love
to
any
one
it
would
always
be
the
tilt
of
a
chin
or
the
turn
of
a
cheek
that
he
was
admiring
to
paint
no
there
no
chance
for
a
romance
there
but
there
calderwell
eyebrows
rose
the
fraction
of
an
inch
oh
of
course
i
presume
january
or
february
will
find
me
back
there
he
admitted
with
a
sigh
and
a
shrug
then
a
little
bitterly
he
added
no
arkwright
i
shall
keep
away
if
i
can
i
there
no
chance
for
me
then
you
leave
me
a
clear
field
bantered
the
other
of
course
jane
retorted
calderwell
with
equal
lightness
thank
oh
you
need
laughed
calderwell
my
giving
you
the
right
of
way
does
insure
you
a
thoroughfare
for
yourself
there
are
others
you
know
billy
neilson
has
had
sighing
swains
about
i
her
i
imagine
since
she
could
walk
and
talk
she
is
a
wonderfully
fascinating
little
bit
of
femininity
and
she
has
a
heart
of
pure
gold
all
is
i
envy
the
man
who
wins
it
for
the
man
who
wins
that
wins
there
was
no
answer
arkwright
sat
with
his
eyes
on
the
moving
throng
outside
the
window
near
them
perhaps
he
had
not
heard
at
all
events
when
he
spoke
some
time
later
it
was
of
a
matter
far
removed
from
miss
billy
neilson
or
the
way
to
her
heart
nor
was
the
young
lady
mentioned
between
them
again
that
day
long
hours
later
just
before
parting
for
the
night
arkwright
said
calderwell
i
sorry
but
i
believe
after
all
i
ca
take
that
trip
to
the
lakes
with
you
i
i
going
home
next
home
hang
it
arkwright
i
counted
on
you
is
this
rather
sudden
yes
and
no
i
own
i
been
drifting
about
with
you
contentedly
enough
for
the
last
six
months
to
make
you
think
and
were
the
end
and
aim
of
my
existence
but
they
are
you
know
nonsense
at
heart
you
as
much
of
a
vagabond
as
i
am
and
you
know
perhaps
but
unfortunately
i
do
happen
to
carry
your
you
may
if
you
like
i
hand
it
over
any
time
grinned
calderwell
thanks
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
shrugged
the
other
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
calderwell
queried
arkwright
how
old
are
you
good
then
you
merely
travelling
to
supplement
your
education
see
oh
yes
i
see
but
something
besides
my
education
has
got
to
be
supplemented
now
i
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
was
an
almost
imperceptible
hesitation
then
a
little
shortly
came
the
answer
hit
the
trail
for
grand
opera
and
bring
up
probably
in
calderwell
smiled
appreciatively
you
sing
like
the
devil
he
admitted
thanks
returned
his
friend
with
uplifted
eyebrows
do
you
mind
calling
it
angel
just
for
this
occasion
oh
the
will
do
that
fast
enough
but
i
say
arkwright
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
initials
then
let
oh
no
you
wo
and
you
wo
be
jane
either
imagine
a
mary
jane
in
grand
opera
i
know
what
you
be
you
be
martini
johnini
arkwrightino
by
the
way
you
did
say
what
that
j
really
did
stand
for
hinted
calderwell
shamelessly
jokes
in
your
estimation
evidently
shrugged
the
other
but
my
going
is
a
joke
calderwell
i
really
going
and
i
going
to
but
how
shall
you
manage
time
will
calderwell
frowned
and
stirred
restlessly
in
his
chair
but
honestly
now
to
to
follow
that
trail
of
yours
will
take
money
and
er
a
faint
red
stole
to
his
forehead
do
they
have
er
patrons
for
these
young
and
budding
geniuses
why
ca
i
have
a
hand
in
this
trail
too
or
maybe
you
call
it
a
foot
eh
i
be
no
end
glad
to
thanks
old
the
red
was
duplicated
this
time
above
the
brown
silky
beard
that
was
mighty
kind
of
you
and
i
appreciate
it
but
it
wo
be
necessary
a
generous
but
perhaps
misguided
bachelor
uncle
left
me
a
few
thousands
a
year
or
so
ago
and
i
going
to
put
them
all
down
my
throat
or
rather
it
before
i
give
where
you
going
to
study
new
york
again
there
was
an
almost
imperceptible
hesitation
before
the
answer
came
i
not
quite
prepared
to
why
not
try
it
here
arkwright
shook
his
head
i
did
plan
to
when
i
came
over
but
i
changed
my
mind
i
believe
rather
work
while
longer
in
murmured
calderwell
there
was
a
brief
silence
followed
by
other
questions
and
other
answers
after
which
the
friends
said
good
night
in
his
own
room
as
he
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
calderwell
muttered
drowsily
by
george
i
have
found
out
yet
what
that
blamed
j
stands
for
chapter
ii
aunt
hannah
gets
a
letter
in
the
cozy
at
hillside
billy
neilson
pretty
home
on
corey
hill
billy
herself
sat
writing
at
the
desk
her
pen
had
just
traced
the
date
october
when
stetson
entered
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
writing
my
dear
then
do
let
me
disturb
she
turned
as
if
to
go
billy
dropped
her
pen
sprang
to
her
feet
flew
to
the
little
side
and
whirled
her
half
across
the
room
there
she
exclaimed
as
she
plumped
the
breathless
and
scandalized
aunt
hannah
into
the
biggest
easy
chair
i
feel
better
i
just
had
to
let
off
steam
some
way
it
so
lovely
you
came
in
just
when
you
did
indeed
i
i
not
so
sure
of
that
stammered
the
lady
dropping
the
letter
into
her
lap
and
patting
with
agitated
fingers
her
cap
her
curls
the
two
shawls
about
her
shoulders
and
the
lace
at
her
throat
my
grief
and
conscience
billy
you
grow
up
hope
not
purred
billy
cheerfully
dropping
herself
on
to
a
low
hassock
at
aunt
hannah
feet
but
my
dear
you
you
engaged
billy
bubbled
into
a
chuckling
laugh
as
if
i
did
know
that
when
i
just
written
a
dozen
notes
to
announce
it
and
oh
aunt
hannah
such
a
time
as
i
had
telling
what
a
dear
bertram
is
and
how
i
love
love
him
and
what
beautiful
eyes
he
has
and
a
nose
and
billy
aunt
hannah
was
sitting
erect
in
pale
horror
eh
billy
eyes
were
roguish
you
did
write
that
in
those
notes
write
it
oh
no
that
only
what
i
to
write
chuckled
billy
what
i
really
did
write
was
as
staid
and
proper
as
here
let
me
show
you
she
broke
off
springing
to
her
feet
and
running
over
to
her
desk
there
this
is
about
what
i
wrote
to
them
all
she
finished
whipping
a
note
out
of
one
of
the
unsealed
envelopes
on
the
desk
and
spreading
it
open
before
aunt
hannah
suspicious
eyes
that
is
very
good
for
you
admitted
the
lady
well
i
like
that
after
all
my
stern
and
to
keep
out
all
those
things
i
to
write
bridled
billy
besides
they
have
been
ever
so
much
more
interesting
reading
than
these
will
be
she
pouted
as
she
took
the
note
from
her
hand
i
do
doubt
it
observed
aunt
hannah
dryly
billy
laughed
and
tossed
the
note
back
on
the
desk
i
writing
to
belle
calderwell
now
she
announced
musingly
dropping
herself
again
on
the
hassock
i
suppose
she
tell
poor
boy
he
be
billy
sighed
but
she
uptilted
her
chin
a
little
he
ought
not
to
be
i
told
him
long
long
ago
the
very
first
time
that
that
i
i
know
dear
but
they
do
always
aunt
hannah
sighed
in
sympathy
with
the
hugh
calderwell
as
she
looked
down
at
the
bright
young
face
near
her
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
billy
gave
a
little
laugh
he
be
surprised
she
said
he
told
me
once
that
bertram
would
ever
care
for
any
girl
except
to
paint
to
paint
indeed
as
if
bertram
did
love
me
just
if
he
never
saw
another
tube
of
paint
i
think
he
does
my
again
there
was
silence
then
from
billy
lips
there
came
softly
just
think
we
been
engaged
almost
four
weeks
and
be
announced
i
so
glad
i
did
ever
announce
the
other
two
the
other
cried
aunt
hannah
billy
laughed
oh
i
forgot
you
did
know
about
cyril
oh
there
did
anybody
know
it
either
not
even
cyril
himself
dimpled
billy
mischievously
i
just
engaged
myself
to
him
in
imagination
you
know
to
see
how
i
like
it
i
did
like
it
but
it
did
last
anyhow
very
long
just
three
weeks
i
believe
then
i
broke
it
off
she
finished
with
unsmiling
mouth
but
dancing
eyes
billy
protested
aunt
hannah
feebly
but
i
glad
only
the
family
knew
about
my
engagement
to
uncle
william
oh
aunt
hannah
you
do
know
how
good
it
does
seem
to
call
him
again
it
was
always
slipping
out
anyhow
all
the
time
we
were
engaged
and
of
course
it
was
awful
that
only
goes
to
prove
my
dear
how
entirely
unsuitable
it
was
from
the
a
bright
color
flooded
billy
face
i
know
but
if
a
girl
think
a
man
is
asking
for
a
wife
when
all
he
wants
is
a
daughter
and
if
she
blandly
says
thank
you
marry
you
i
do
know
what
you
can
expect
you
can
expect
just
what
you
got
misery
and
almost
a
tragedy
retorted
aunt
hannah
severely
a
tender
light
came
into
billy
eyes
dear
uncle
william
what
a
jewel
he
was
all
the
way
through
and
have
marched
straight
to
the
altar
too
with
never
a
flicker
of
an
eyelid
i
know
martyr
that
he
was
martyr
bristled
aunt
hannah
with
extraordinary
violence
for
her
i
thinking
that
term
belonged
somewhere
else
a
month
ago
billy
neilson
you
did
not
look
as
if
you
live
out
half
your
days
but
i
suppose
have
gone
to
the
altar
too
with
never
a
flicker
of
an
eyelid
but
i
thought
i
had
to
protested
billy
i
could
grieve
uncle
william
so
after
hartwell
had
said
how
he
he
wanted
aunt
hannah
lips
grew
stern
at
the
corners
there
are
times
when
when
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
if
kate
hartwell
would
attend
to
her
own
affairs
aunt
hannah
voice
fairly
shook
with
wrath
hannah
reproved
billy
in
mischievous
horror
i
shocked
at
you
aunt
hannah
flushed
miserably
there
there
child
forget
i
said
it
i
ought
not
to
have
said
it
of
course
she
murmured
agitatedly
billy
laughed
you
should
have
heard
what
uncle
william
said
but
never
mind
we
all
found
out
the
mistake
before
it
was
too
late
and
everything
is
lovely
now
even
to
cyril
and
marie
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
beatifically
happy
as
that
couple
are
bertram
says
he
has
heard
a
dirge
from
cyril
rooms
for
three
weeks
and
that
if
anybody
else
played
the
kind
of
music
he
been
playing
it
would
be
just
common
garden
ragtime
music
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
that
makes
me
think
billy
if
not
actually
forgetting
what
i
came
in
here
for
cried
aunt
hannah
fumbling
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
for
the
letter
that
had
slipped
from
her
lap
i
had
word
from
a
young
niece
she
going
to
study
music
in
a
niece
well
not
really
you
know
she
calls
me
just
as
you
and
the
henshaw
boys
do
but
i
really
am
related
to
for
her
mother
and
i
are
third
cousins
while
it
was
my
husband
who
was
distantly
related
to
the
henshaw
what
her
name
jane
arkwright
where
is
that
letter
here
it
is
on
the
floor
reported
billy
were
you
going
to
read
it
to
me
she
asked
as
she
picked
it
up
yes
if
you
do
i
love
to
hear
then
i
read
it
it
it
rather
annoys
me
in
some
ways
i
thought
the
whole
family
understood
that
i
was
living
by
myself
any
longer
that
i
was
living
with
you
i
sure
i
thought
i
wrote
them
that
long
ago
but
this
sounds
almost
as
if
they
did
understand
it
at
least
as
if
this
girl
how
old
is
she
i
do
know
but
she
must
be
some
old
to
be
coming
here
to
boston
to
study
music
alone
singing
i
think
she
you
do
remember
her
then
aunt
hannah
frowned
and
paused
the
letter
half
withdrawn
from
its
envelope
no
but
that
is
strange
they
live
west
i
have
seen
any
of
them
for
years
i
know
there
are
several
children
and
i
suppose
i
been
told
their
names
i
know
there
a
boy
the
eldest
i
think
who
is
quite
a
singer
and
there
a
girl
who
paints
i
believe
but
i
seem
to
remember
a
jane
never
mind
suppose
we
let
mary
jane
speak
for
herself
suggested
billy
dropping
her
chin
into
the
small
pink
cup
of
her
hand
and
settling
herself
to
listen
very
well
sighed
aunt
hannah
and
she
opened
the
letter
and
began
to
read
dear
aunt
hannah
this
is
to
tell
you
that
i
coming
to
boston
to
study
singing
in
the
school
for
grand
opera
and
i
planning
to
look
you
up
do
you
object
i
said
to
a
friend
the
other
day
that
i
half
a
mind
to
write
to
aunt
hannah
and
beg
a
home
with
her
and
my
friend
retorted
do
you
mary
jane
but
that
of
course
i
should
not
think
of
doing
but
i
know
i
shall
be
lonesome
aunt
hannah
and
i
hope
you
let
me
see
you
once
in
a
while
anyway
i
plan
now
to
come
next
week
i
already
got
as
far
as
new
york
as
you
see
by
the
address
and
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
soon
all
the
family
would
send
love
i
know
m
grand
opera
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
cried
billy
yes
but
billy
do
you
think
she
is
expecting
me
to
invite
her
to
make
her
home
with
me
i
shall
have
to
write
and
explain
that
i
ca
if
she
does
of
billy
frowned
and
hesitated
why
it
sounded
a
little
that
way
but
suddenly
her
face
cleared
aunt
hannah
i
thought
of
the
very
thing
we
take
her
oh
billy
i
could
think
of
letting
you
do
that
demurred
aunt
hannah
you
very
kind
but
oh
no
not
that
why
not
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
and
we
can
just
as
well
as
not
after
marie
is
married
in
december
she
can
have
that
room
until
then
she
can
have
the
little
blue
room
next
to
but
but
we
do
know
anything
about
we
know
she
your
niece
and
she
lonesome
and
we
know
musical
i
shall
love
her
for
every
one
of
those
things
of
course
take
her
but
i
do
know
anything
about
her
all
the
more
reason
why
she
should
be
looked
out
for
then
retorted
billy
promptly
why
aunt
hannah
just
as
if
you
did
want
to
give
this
lonesome
unprotected
young
girl
a
home
oh
i
do
of
course
but
then
it
all
settled
interposed
billy
springing
to
her
feet
but
what
if
we
we
should
like
her
nonsense
what
if
she
should
like
us
laughed
billy
however
if
you
feel
better
just
ask
her
to
come
and
stay
with
us
a
month
we
shall
keep
her
all
right
afterwards
see
if
we
do
slowly
aunt
hannah
got
to
her
feet
very
well
dear
i
write
of
course
as
you
tell
me
to
and
lovely
of
you
to
do
it
now
i
leave
you
to
your
letters
hindered
you
far
too
long
as
it
you
rested
me
declared
billy
flinging
wide
her
arms
aunt
hannah
fearing
a
second
dizzying
whirl
impelled
by
those
same
young
arms
drew
her
shawls
about
her
shoulders
and
backed
hastily
toward
the
hall
door
billy
laughed
oh
i
wo
again
she
promised
merrily
then
as
the
lady
reached
the
arched
doorway
tell
mary
jane
to
let
us
know
the
day
and
train
and
we
meet
her
oh
and
aunt
hannah
tell
her
to
wear
a
pink
a
white
pink
and
tell
her
we
will
too
she
finished
gayly
chapter
iii
billy
and
bertram
bertram
called
that
evening
before
the
open
fire
in
the
he
found
a
pensive
billy
awaiting
him
a
billy
who
let
herself
be
kissed
it
is
true
and
who
even
kissed
back
shyly
adorably
but
a
billy
who
looked
at
him
with
wide
almost
frightened
eyes
why
darling
what
the
matter
he
demanded
his
own
eyes
growing
wide
and
frightened
bertram
it
done
what
done
what
do
you
mean
our
engagement
it
announced
i
wrote
stacks
of
notes
and
even
now
there
are
some
left
for
and
then
there
the
newspapers
bertram
right
away
now
will
know
her
voice
was
tragic
bertram
relaxed
visibly
a
tender
light
came
to
his
eyes
well
did
you
expect
everybody
would
know
it
my
dear
but
at
her
hesitation
the
tender
light
changed
to
a
quick
fear
billy
you
are
sorry
the
pink
glory
that
suffused
her
face
answered
him
before
her
words
did
sorry
oh
never
bertram
it
only
that
it
wo
be
ours
any
longer
that
is
it
wo
belong
to
just
our
two
selves
everybody
will
know
it
and
they
bow
and
smile
and
say
lovely
to
our
faces
and
you
ever
to
our
backs
oh
no
i
not
sorry
bertram
but
i
am
billy
billy
sighed
and
gazed
with
pensive
eyes
into
the
fire
across
bertram
face
swept
surprise
consternation
and
dismay
bertram
had
thought
he
knew
billy
in
all
her
moods
and
fancies
but
he
did
not
know
her
in
this
one
why
billy
he
breathed
billy
drew
another
sigh
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
bottoms
of
her
small
feet
well
i
am
you
bertram
henshaw
you
know
lots
and
lots
of
people
that
i
never
even
saw
and
they
come
and
stand
around
and
stare
and
lift
their
lorgnettes
and
say
that
the
one
dear
me
bertram
gave
a
relieved
laugh
nonsense
sweetheart
i
should
think
you
were
a
picture
i
painted
and
hung
on
a
i
shall
feel
as
if
i
were
with
all
those
friends
of
yours
bertram
what
if
they
do
like
it
her
voice
had
grown
tragic
again
it
yes
the
picture
me
i
they
ca
help
liking
it
he
retorted
with
the
prompt
certainty
of
an
adoring
lover
billy
shook
her
head
her
eyes
had
gone
back
to
the
fire
oh
yes
they
can
i
can
hear
them
bertram
wife
a
frivolous
inconsequential
billy
like
that
bertram
billy
turned
fiercely
despairing
eyes
on
her
lover
bertram
sometimes
i
wish
my
name
were
cordelia
or
maud
or
jane
anything
that
feminine
and
proper
bertram
ringing
laugh
brought
a
faint
smile
to
billy
lips
but
the
words
that
followed
the
laugh
and
the
caressing
touch
of
the
hands
sent
a
flood
of
shy
color
to
her
face
jane
indeed
as
if
i
exchange
my
billy
for
her
or
any
clarissa
or
arabella
that
ever
grew
i
adore
billy
flame
nature
and
and
naughtiness
put
in
billy
herself
yes
if
there
be
any
laughed
bertram
fondly
but
see
he
added
taking
a
tiny
box
from
his
pocket
see
what
i
brought
for
this
same
billy
to
wear
she
have
had
it
long
ago
if
she
had
insisted
on
waiting
for
this
announcement
oh
bertram
what
a
beauty
dimpled
billy
as
the
flawless
diamond
in
bertram
fingers
caught
the
light
and
sent
it
back
in
a
flash
of
flame
and
crimson
now
you
are
mine
really
mine
sweetheart
the
man
voice
and
hand
shook
as
he
slipped
the
ring
on
billy
outstretched
finger
billy
caught
her
breath
with
almost
a
sob
and
i
so
glad
to
be
yours
dear
she
murmured
brokenly
and
and
i
make
you
proud
that
i
am
yours
even
if
i
am
just
she
choked
oh
i
know
i
write
such
beautiful
beautiful
songs
the
man
drew
her
into
a
close
embrace
as
if
i
cared
for
that
he
scoffed
lovingly
billy
looked
up
in
quick
horror
why
bertram
you
do
mean
you
do
care
he
laughed
lightly
and
took
the
dismayed
little
face
between
his
two
hands
care
darling
of
course
i
care
you
know
how
i
love
your
music
i
care
about
everything
that
concerns
you
i
meant
that
i
proud
of
you
just
you
i
love
you
there
was
a
moment
pause
billy
eyes
as
they
looked
at
him
carried
a
curious
intentness
in
their
dark
depths
you
mean
you
like
the
turn
of
my
head
and
the
tilt
of
my
chin
she
asked
a
little
breathlessly
i
adore
them
came
the
prompt
answer
to
bertram
utter
amazement
billy
drew
back
with
a
sharp
cry
no
no
not
that
why
billy
laughed
unexpectedly
then
she
sighed
oh
it
all
right
of
course
she
assured
him
hastily
it
only
billy
stopped
and
blushed
billy
was
thinking
of
what
hugh
calderwell
had
once
said
to
her
that
bertram
henshaw
would
never
love
any
girl
seriously
that
it
would
always
be
the
turn
of
her
head
or
the
tilt
of
her
chin
that
he
loved
to
paint
well
only
what
demanded
bertram
billy
blushed
the
more
deeply
but
she
gave
a
light
laugh
nothing
only
something
hugh
calderwell
said
to
me
once
you
see
bertram
i
do
think
hugh
ever
thought
you
would
oh
did
he
bridled
bertram
well
that
only
goes
to
show
how
much
he
knows
about
it
er
did
you
announce
it
to
him
bertram
voice
was
almost
savage
now
billy
smiled
no
but
i
did
to
his
sister
and
she
tell
him
oh
bertram
such
a
time
as
i
had
over
those
notes
went
on
billy
with
a
chuckle
her
eyes
were
dancing
and
she
was
seeming
more
like
her
usual
self
bertram
thought
you
see
there
were
such
a
lot
of
things
i
wanted
to
say
about
what
a
dear
you
were
and
how
much
i
i
liked
you
and
that
you
had
such
lovely
eyes
and
a
nose
billy
this
time
it
was
bertram
who
was
sitting
erect
in
pale
horror
billy
threw
him
a
roguish
glance
goosey
you
are
as
bad
as
aunt
hannah
i
said
that
was
what
i
to
say
what
i
really
said
was
quite
another
matter
she
finished
with
a
saucy
uptilting
of
her
chin
bertram
relaxed
with
a
laugh
you
witch
his
admiring
eyes
still
lingered
on
her
face
billy
going
to
paint
you
sometime
in
just
that
pose
you
adorable
pooh
just
another
face
of
a
girl
teased
the
adorable
one
bertram
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
there
and
i
have
told
you
yet
guess
what
my
next
commission
to
paint
a
portrait
ca
who
is
it
j
winthrop
not
winthrop
the
oh
bertram
how
splendid
is
it
and
then
the
girl
herself
have
you
seen
her
but
you
have
i
know
unless
you
met
her
abroad
she
has
been
in
boston
for
years
until
no
i
have
seen
her
is
she
so
beautiful
billy
spoke
a
little
soberly
yes
and
the
artist
lifted
his
head
alertly
what
billy
called
his
painting
look
came
to
his
face
it
is
that
her
features
are
so
regular
though
her
mouth
and
chin
are
perfect
but
her
face
has
so
much
character
and
there
an
elusive
something
about
her
eyes
jove
if
i
can
only
catch
it
it
be
the
best
thing
yet
that
i
ever
done
will
it
i
so
glad
and
you
get
it
i
know
you
will
claimed
billy
clearing
her
throat
a
little
nervously
i
wish
i
felt
so
sure
sighed
bertram
but
it
be
a
great
thing
if
i
do
get
it
winthrop
daughter
you
know
besides
the
merit
of
the
likeness
yes
yes
indeed
billy
cleared
her
throat
again
you
seen
her
of
course
lately
oh
yes
i
was
there
half
the
morning
discussing
the
details
sittings
and
costume
and
deciding
on
the
did
you
find
one
to
suit
find
one
the
artist
made
a
despairing
gesture
i
found
a
dozen
that
i
wanted
the
trouble
was
to
tell
which
i
wanted
the
billy
gave
a
nervous
little
laugh
is
that
unusual
she
asked
bertram
lifted
his
eyebrows
with
a
quizzical
smile
well
they
are
all
marguerite
winthrops
he
reminded
her
marguerite
cried
billy
oh
is
her
name
marguerite
i
do
think
marguerite
is
the
dearest
name
billy
eyes
and
voice
were
wistful
i
do
not
the
oh
it
all
well
enough
of
course
but
it
ca
be
compared
for
a
moment
to
well
say
billy
smiled
but
she
shook
her
head
i
afraid
you
not
a
good
judge
of
names
she
objected
yes
i
am
though
for
that
matter
i
should
love
your
name
no
matter
what
it
even
if
was
jane
eh
bantered
billy
well
you
have
a
chance
to
find
out
how
you
like
that
name
pretty
quick
sir
we
going
to
have
one
you
going
to
have
a
mary
jane
here
do
you
mean
that
rosa
going
away
mercy
i
hope
not
shuddered
billy
you
do
find
a
rosa
in
every
kitchen
and
never
in
employment
agencies
my
mary
jane
is
a
niece
of
aunt
hannah
or
rather
a
cousin
she
coming
to
boston
to
study
music
and
i
invited
her
here
we
asked
her
for
a
month
though
i
presume
we
shall
keep
her
right
bertram
frowned
well
of
course
that
very
nice
for
he
sighed
with
meaning
emphasis
billy
laughed
do
worry
dear
she
wo
bother
us
oh
yes
she
will
sighed
bertram
she
be
lots
you
see
if
she
is
billy
i
think
sometimes
you
almost
too
kind
to
other
never
laughed
billy
besides
what
would
you
have
me
do
when
a
lonesome
young
girl
was
coming
to
boston
anyhow
not
the
one
to
talk
young
man
i
known
to
take
in
a
lonesome
girl
and
give
her
a
home
she
flashed
merrily
bertram
chuckled
jove
what
a
time
that
was
he
exclaimed
regarding
his
companion
with
fond
eyes
and
spunk
too
is
she
going
to
bring
a
spunk
not
that
i
heard
smiled
billy
but
she
going
to
wear
a
not
really
billy
of
course
she
is
i
told
her
to
how
do
you
suppose
we
could
know
her
when
we
saw
her
if
she
did
demanded
the
girl
indignantly
and
what
is
more
sir
there
will
be
pinks
worn
this
time
do
as
uncle
william
did
and
leave
off
my
pink
only
think
what
long
minutes
that
seemed
hours
of
misery
i
spent
waiting
there
in
that
just
because
i
did
know
which
man
was
my
uncle
william
bertram
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
your
mary
jane
wo
probably
turn
out
to
be
quite
such
a
bombshell
as
our
billy
did
unless
she
should
prove
to
be
a
boy
he
added
whimsically
oh
but
billy
she
turn
out
to
be
such
a
dear
treasure
finished
the
man
and
at
the
adoring
look
in
his
eyes
billy
blushed
deeply
and
promptly
forgot
all
about
mary
jane
and
her
pink
chapter
iv
for
mary
jane
i
have
a
letter
here
from
mary
jane
my
dear
announced
aunt
hannah
at
the
luncheon
table
one
day
have
you
billy
raised
interested
eyes
from
her
own
letters
what
does
she
say
she
will
be
here
thursday
her
train
is
due
at
the
south
station
at
she
seems
to
be
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
offer
to
let
her
come
right
here
for
a
month
but
she
says
she
afraid
you
realize
perhaps
just
what
you
are
doing
to
take
her
in
like
that
with
her
singing
and
nonsense
she
does
refuse
does
she
oh
no
she
does
refuse
but
she
does
accept
either
exactly
as
i
can
see
i
read
the
letter
over
twice
too
i
let
you
judge
for
yourself
by
and
by
when
you
have
time
to
read
billy
laughed
never
mind
i
do
want
to
read
it
she
just
a
little
shy
about
coming
that
all
she
stay
all
right
when
we
come
to
meet
her
what
time
did
you
say
it
was
thursday
half
past
four
south
thursday
at
half
past
four
let
me
see
that
the
day
of
the
carletons
home
is
it
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
yes
but
i
had
forgotten
it
what
shall
we
do
oh
that
will
be
easy
we
just
go
to
the
carletons
early
and
have
john
wait
then
take
us
from
there
to
the
south
station
meanwhile
make
sure
that
the
little
blue
room
is
all
ready
for
her
i
put
in
my
white
enamel
yesterday
and
that
pretty
little
blue
case
for
hairpins
and
curling
tongs
that
i
bought
at
the
fair
i
want
the
room
to
look
homey
to
her
you
as
if
it
could
look
any
other
way
if
had
anything
to
do
with
it
sighed
aunt
hannah
admiringly
billy
laughed
if
we
get
stranded
we
might
ask
the
henshaw
boys
to
help
us
out
aunt
hannah
they
probably
suggest
guns
and
swords
that
the
way
they
fixed
up
aunt
hannah
raised
shocked
hands
of
protest
as
if
we
would
mercy
what
a
time
that
was
billy
laughed
again
i
never
shall
forget
my
first
glimpse
of
that
room
when
hartwell
switched
on
the
lights
oh
aunt
hannah
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
before
they
took
out
those
guns
and
spiders
as
if
i
did
see
quite
enough
when
i
saw
william
face
that
morning
he
came
for
me
retorted
aunt
hannah
spiritedly
dear
uncle
william
what
an
old
saint
he
has
been
all
the
way
through
mused
billy
aloud
and
cyril
who
would
ever
have
believed
that
the
day
would
come
when
cyril
would
say
to
me
as
he
did
last
night
that
he
felt
as
if
marie
had
been
gone
a
month
it
been
just
seven
days
you
i
know
she
comes
does
she
yes
and
i
glad
i
shall
tell
marie
she
need
leave
cyril
on
hands
again
bertram
says
that
at
home
cyril
has
played
a
dirge
since
his
engagement
but
i
notice
that
up
here
where
marie
might
be
but
is
his
tunes
would
never
be
mistaken
for
ragtime
by
the
way
she
added
as
she
rose
from
the
table
that
another
surprise
in
store
for
hugh
calderwell
he
always
declared
that
cyril
was
a
marrying
man
either
any
more
than
bertram
you
know
he
said
bertram
only
cared
for
girls
to
paint
but
she
stopped
and
looked
inquiringly
at
rosa
who
had
appeared
at
that
moment
in
the
hall
doorway
it
the
telephone
miss
neilson
bertram
henshaw
wants
a
few
minutes
later
aunt
hannah
heard
billy
at
the
piano
for
fifteen
twenty
thirty
minutes
the
brilliant
scales
and
arpeggios
rippled
through
the
rooms
and
up
the
stairs
to
aunt
hannah
who
knew
by
the
very
sound
of
them
that
some
unusual
nervousness
was
being
worked
off
at
the
finger
tips
that
played
them
at
the
end
of
minutes
aunt
hannah
went
billy
my
dear
excuse
me
but
have
you
forgotten
what
time
it
is
were
you
going
out
with
bertram
billy
stopped
playing
at
once
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
her
fingers
busied
themselves
with
some
music
on
the
piano
we
are
going
aunt
hannah
she
said
bertram
well
he
did
want
to
so
of
course
i
said
not
to
he
been
painting
this
morning
on
a
new
portrait
and
she
said
he
might
stay
to
luncheon
and
keep
right
on
for
a
while
this
afternoon
if
he
liked
and
he
did
like
so
he
why
how
how
aunt
hannah
stopped
helplessly
oh
no
not
at
all
interposed
billy
lightly
he
told
me
all
about
it
the
other
night
it
going
to
be
a
very
wonderful
portrait
and
of
course
i
would
want
to
interfere
with
his
work
and
again
a
brilliant
scale
rippled
from
billy
fingers
after
a
crashing
chord
in
the
bass
slowly
aunt
hannah
turned
and
went
her
eyes
were
troubled
not
since
billy
engagement
had
she
heard
billy
play
like
that
bertram
did
not
find
a
pensive
billy
awaiting
him
that
evening
he
found
a
billy
who
let
herself
be
kissed
once
but
who
did
not
kiss
back
a
blithe
elusive
billy
who
played
tripping
little
melodies
and
sang
jolly
little
songs
instead
of
sitting
before
the
fire
and
talking
a
billy
who
at
last
turned
and
asked
tranquilly
well
how
did
the
picture
go
bertram
rose
then
crossed
the
room
and
took
billy
very
gently
into
his
arms
sweetheart
you
were
a
dear
this
noon
to
let
me
off
like
that
he
began
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
you
do
know
perhaps
exactly
what
you
did
you
see
i
was
nearly
wild
between
wanting
to
be
with
you
and
wanting
to
go
on
with
my
work
and
i
was
just
at
that
point
where
one
little
word
from
you
one
hint
that
you
wanted
me
to
come
anyway
and
i
should
have
come
but
you
did
say
it
nor
hint
it
like
the
brave
little
bit
of
inspiration
that
you
are
you
bade
me
stay
and
go
on
with
my
the
inspiration
head
drooped
a
little
lower
but
this
only
brought
a
wealth
of
soft
bronze
hair
to
just
where
bertram
could
lay
his
cheek
against
it
and
bertram
promptly
took
advantage
of
his
opportunity
and
so
i
stayed
billy
and
i
did
good
work
i
know
i
did
good
work
why
billy
bertram
stepped
back
now
and
held
billy
by
the
shoulders
at
arms
length
billy
that
going
to
be
the
best
work
i
ever
done
i
can
see
it
coming
even
now
under
my
billy
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
her
lover
face
his
eyes
were
glowing
his
cheeks
were
flushed
his
whole
countenance
was
aflame
with
the
soul
of
the
artist
who
sees
his
vision
taking
shape
before
him
and
billy
looking
at
him
felt
suddenly
ashamed
oh
bertram
i
proud
proud
of
you
she
breathed
come
let
go
over
to
the
talk
chapter
marie
speaks
her
mind
billy
with
john
and
peggy
met
marie
hawthorn
at
the
station
peggy
was
short
for
pegasus
and
was
what
billy
always
called
her
luxurious
touring
car
i
simply
wo
call
it
she
had
declared
when
she
bought
it
in
the
first
place
it
takes
too
long
to
say
it
and
in
the
second
place
i
do
want
to
add
one
more
to
the
nineteen
different
ways
to
pronounce
it
that
i
hear
all
around
me
every
day
now
as
for
calling
it
my
or
my
car
i
should
expect
to
see
a
pullman
or
one
of
those
huge
black
trucks
before
my
door
if
i
ordered
it
by
either
of
those
names
neither
will
i
insult
the
beautiful
thing
by
calling
it
a
its
name
is
pegasus
i
shall
call
it
and
peggy
she
called
it
john
sniffed
his
disdain
and
billy
friends
made
no
secret
of
their
amused
tolerance
but
in
an
astonishingly
short
time
half
the
automobile
owners
of
her
acquaintance
were
calling
their
own
cars
peggy
and
even
the
dignified
john
himself
was
heard
to
order
some
gasoline
for
peggy
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
when
marie
hawthorn
stepped
from
the
train
at
the
north
station
she
greeted
billy
with
affectionate
warmth
though
at
once
her
blue
eyes
swept
the
space
beyond
expectantly
and
eagerly
billy
lips
curved
in
a
mischievous
smile
no
he
did
come
she
said
he
did
want
to
a
little
marie
grew
actually
pale
did
to
she
stammered
billy
gave
her
a
spasmodic
hug
goosey
no
he
did
a
bit
but
he
did
a
great
bit
as
if
you
did
know
he
was
dying
to
come
marie
but
he
simply
could
something
about
his
concert
monday
night
he
told
me
over
the
telephone
but
between
his
joy
that
you
were
coming
and
his
rage
that
he
could
see
you
the
first
minute
you
did
come
i
could
quite
make
out
what
was
the
trouble
but
he
coming
to
dinner
so
doubtless
tell
you
all
about
marie
sighed
her
relief
oh
that
all
right
then
i
was
afraid
he
was
sick
when
i
did
see
billy
laughed
softly
no
he
is
sick
marie
but
you
need
go
away
again
before
the
wedding
not
to
leave
him
on
my
hands
i
would
have
believed
cyril
henshaw
confirmed
old
bachelor
and
avowed
could
have
acted
the
part
of
a
boy
as
he
has
the
last
week
or
the
on
marie
cheek
spread
to
the
roots
of
her
fine
yellow
hair
billy
dear
he
he
did
marie
dear
he
he
did
marie
laughed
she
did
not
say
anything
but
the
deepened
as
she
occupied
herself
very
busily
in
getting
her
from
the
little
hand
bag
she
carried
cyril
was
not
mentioned
again
until
the
two
girls
veils
tied
and
coats
buttoned
were
snugly
ensconced
in
the
tonneau
and
peggy
nose
was
turned
toward
home
then
billy
asked
have
you
settled
on
where
you
going
to
live
not
quite
we
going
to
talk
of
that
but
we
know
that
we
are
going
to
live
at
the
marie
marie
stirred
uneasily
at
the
obvious
disappointment
and
reproach
in
her
friend
voice
but
dear
it
would
be
wise
i
sure
she
argued
hastily
there
will
be
you
and
bertram
we
be
there
for
a
year
nearly
cut
in
billy
with
swift
promptness
besides
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
all
marie
smiled
but
she
shook
her
head
lovely
but
not
practical
billy
laughed
ruefully
i
know
you
worrying
about
those
puddings
of
yours
you
afraid
somebody
is
going
to
interfere
with
your
making
quite
so
many
as
you
want
to
and
cyril
is
worrying
for
fear
there
be
somebody
else
in
the
circle
of
his
shaded
lamp
besides
his
little
marie
with
the
light
on
her
hair
and
the
mending
basket
by
her
billy
what
are
you
talking
about
billy
threw
a
roguish
glance
into
her
friend
amazed
blue
eyes
oh
just
a
little
picture
cyril
drew
once
for
me
of
what
home
meant
for
him
a
room
with
a
table
and
a
shaded
lamp
and
a
little
woman
beside
it
with
the
light
on
her
hair
and
a
great
basket
of
sewing
by
her
marie
eyes
softened
did
he
say
that
yes
oh
he
declared
he
should
want
her
to
sit
under
that
lamp
all
the
time
of
course
but
he
hoped
she
like
that
sort
of
marie
threw
a
quick
glance
at
the
stolid
back
of
john
beyond
the
two
empty
seats
in
front
of
them
although
she
knew
he
could
not
hear
her
words
instinctively
she
lowered
her
voice
did
you
know
then
about
me
she
asked
with
heightened
color
no
only
that
there
was
a
girl
somewhere
who
he
hoped
would
sit
under
the
lamp
some
day
and
when
i
asked
him
if
the
girl
did
like
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
yes
he
thought
so
for
she
had
told
him
once
that
the
things
she
liked
best
of
all
to
do
were
to
mend
stockings
and
make
puddings
then
i
knew
of
course
was
you
for
i
heard
you
say
the
same
thing
so
i
sent
him
right
along
out
to
you
in
the
the
pink
flush
on
marie
face
grew
to
a
red
one
her
blue
eyes
turned
again
to
john
broad
back
then
drifted
to
the
long
imposing
line
of
windowed
walls
and
doorways
on
the
right
the
automobile
was
passing
smoothly
along
beacon
street
now
with
the
public
garden
just
behind
them
on
the
left
after
a
moment
marie
turned
to
billy
again
i
so
glad
he
wants
just
puddings
and
stockings
she
began
a
little
breathlessly
you
see
for
so
long
i
supposed
he
want
anything
but
a
very
brilliant
talented
wife
who
could
play
and
sing
beautifully
a
wife
he
be
proud
of
like
me
nonsense
laughed
billy
cyril
never
wanted
me
and
i
never
wanted
him
only
once
for
a
few
minutes
so
to
speak
when
i
thought
i
did
in
spite
of
our
music
we
are
a
mite
congenial
i
like
people
around
he
does
i
like
to
go
to
plays
he
does
he
likes
rainy
days
and
i
abhor
them
mercy
life
with
me
for
him
would
be
one
long
jangling
discord
my
love
while
with
you
it
be
one
long
sweet
song
marie
drew
a
deep
breath
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
point
far
ahead
up
the
curveless
street
i
hope
it
will
indeed
she
breathed
not
until
they
were
almost
home
did
billy
say
suddenly
oh
did
cyril
write
you
a
young
relative
of
aunt
hannah
is
coming
to
stay
a
while
at
the
er
yes
cyril
told
me
admitted
marie
billy
smiled
did
like
it
i
suppose
eh
she
queried
shrewdly
i
afraid
he
did
very
well
he
said
she
be
one
more
to
be
there
what
did
i
tell
you
dimpled
billy
you
can
see
what
coming
to
when
you
do
get
that
shaded
lamp
and
the
mending
basket
a
moment
later
coming
in
sight
of
the
house
billy
saw
a
tall
man
standing
on
the
porch
the
man
lifted
his
hat
and
waved
it
gayly
baring
a
slightly
bald
head
to
the
sun
it
uncle
william
bless
his
heart
cried
billy
they
all
coming
to
dinner
then
he
and
aunt
hannah
and
bertram
and
i
are
going
down
to
the
hollis
street
theatre
and
let
you
and
cyril
have
a
taste
of
what
that
shaded
lamp
is
going
to
be
i
hope
you
wo
be
lonesome
she
finished
mischievously
as
the
car
drew
up
before
the
door
chapter
vi
at
the
sign
of
the
pink
after
a
week
of
beautiful
autumn
weather
thursday
dawned
raw
and
cold
by
noon
an
east
wind
had
made
the
temperature
still
more
uncomfortable
at
two
aunt
hannah
tapped
at
billy
chamber
door
she
showed
a
troubled
face
to
the
girl
who
answered
her
knock
billy
you
mind
very
much
if
i
asked
you
to
go
alone
to
the
carletons
and
to
meet
mary
jane
she
inquired
anxiously
why
no
that
is
of
course
i
should
dear
because
i
always
like
to
have
you
go
to
places
with
me
but
it
is
necessary
you
are
sick
are
you
not
exactly
but
i
have
been
sneezing
all
the
morning
and
taking
camphor
and
sugar
to
break
it
up
if
it
is
a
cold
but
it
is
so
raw
and
novemberish
out
that
why
of
course
you
go
you
poor
dear
mercy
do
get
one
of
those
dreadful
colds
on
to
you
before
the
wedding
have
you
felt
a
draft
where
another
shawl
billy
turned
and
cast
searching
eyes
about
the
room
billy
always
kept
shawls
everywhere
for
aunt
shoulders
and
feet
bertram
had
been
known
to
say
indeed
that
a
room
according
to
aunt
hannah
was
not
fully
furnished
unless
it
contained
from
one
to
four
shawls
assorted
as
to
size
and
warmth
shawls
certainly
did
seem
to
be
a
necessity
with
aunt
hannah
as
she
usually
wore
from
one
to
three
at
the
same
time
which
again
caused
bertram
to
declare
that
he
always
counted
aunt
hannah
shawls
when
he
wished
to
know
what
the
thermometer
was
no
i
not
cold
and
i
have
felt
a
draft
said
aunt
hannah
now
i
put
on
my
thickest
gray
shawl
this
morning
with
the
little
pink
one
for
and
the
blue
one
for
breakfast
so
you
see
i
been
very
careful
but
i
sneezed
six
times
so
i
think
be
safer
not
to
go
out
in
this
east
wind
you
were
going
to
stop
for
granger
anyway
were
you
so
you
have
her
with
you
for
the
yes
dear
do
worry
i
take
your
cards
and
explain
to
carleton
and
her
and
of
course
as
far
as
mary
jane
is
concerned
i
do
know
her
any
more
than
you
do
so
i
could
be
any
help
there
sighed
aunt
hannah
not
a
bit
smiled
billy
cheerily
do
give
it
another
thought
my
dear
i
have
a
bit
of
trouble
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
look
for
a
girl
alone
with
a
pink
of
course
i
have
mine
on
too
and
she
be
watching
for
me
so
just
run
along
and
take
your
nap
dear
and
be
all
rested
and
ready
to
welcome
her
when
she
comes
finished
billy
stooping
to
give
the
soft
faintly
pink
cheek
a
warm
kiss
well
thank
you
my
dear
perhaps
i
will
sighed
aunt
hannah
drawing
the
gray
shawl
about
her
as
she
turned
away
contentedly
carleton
tea
that
afternoon
was
for
billy
not
an
occasion
of
unalloyed
joy
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
appeared
at
a
gathering
of
any
size
since
the
announcement
of
her
engagement
and
as
she
dolefully
told
bertram
afterwards
she
had
very
much
the
feeling
of
the
picture
hung
on
the
wall
and
they
put
up
their
lorgnettes
and
say
the
one
she
declared
and
i
know
some
of
them
finished
with
you
ever
too
she
sighed
but
billy
did
not
stay
long
in
carleton
rooms
at
ten
minutes
past
four
she
was
saying
to
a
group
of
friends
who
were
vainly
urging
her
to
remain
longer
i
ca
i
really
ca
she
declared
i
due
at
the
south
station
at
half
past
four
to
meet
a
miss
arkwright
a
young
cousin
of
aunt
hannah
whom
i
never
seen
before
we
to
meet
at
the
sign
of
the
pink
she
explained
smilingly
just
touching
the
single
flower
she
wore
her
hostess
gave
a
sudden
laugh
let
me
see
my
dear
if
i
remember
rightly
you
had
experience
before
meeting
at
this
sign
of
the
pink
at
least
i
have
a
very
vivid
recollection
of
william
henshaw
going
once
to
meet
a
with
a
pink
who
turned
out
to
be
a
girl
now
to
even
things
up
your
girl
should
turn
out
to
be
a
boy
billy
smiled
and
reddened
perhaps
but
i
do
think
will
strike
the
balance
she
retorted
backing
toward
the
door
this
young
lady
name
is
jane
and
i
leave
it
to
you
to
find
anything
very
masculine
in
that
it
was
a
short
drive
from
carleton
commonwealth
avenue
home
to
the
south
station
and
peggy
made
as
quick
work
of
it
as
the
narrow
congested
cross
streets
would
allow
in
ample
time
billy
found
herself
in
the
great
with
john
saying
respectfully
in
her
ear
the
man
says
the
train
comes
in
on
track
fourteen
miss
an
it
on
at
minutes
past
four
billy
left
her
seat
and
walked
down
the
platform
to
track
number
fourteen
she
had
pinned
the
pink
now
to
the
outside
of
her
long
coat
and
it
made
an
attractive
dash
of
white
against
the
velvet
billy
was
looking
particularly
lovely
framing
her
face
was
the
big
velvet
picture
hat
with
its
becoming
white
plumes
during
the
brief
minutes
wait
before
the
clanging
locomotive
puffed
into
view
far
down
the
long
track
billy
thoughts
involuntarily
went
back
to
that
other
watcher
beside
a
train
gate
not
quite
five
years
before
dear
uncle
william
she
murmured
tenderly
then
suddenly
she
laughed
so
nearly
aloud
that
a
man
behind
her
gave
her
a
covert
glance
from
curious
eyes
my
but
what
a
jolt
i
must
have
been
to
uncle
william
billy
was
thinking
the
next
minute
she
drew
nearer
the
gate
and
regarded
with
absorbed
attention
the
long
line
of
passengers
already
sweeping
up
the
narrow
aisle
between
the
cars
hurrying
men
came
first
with
long
strides
and
eyes
that
looked
straight
ahead
these
billy
let
pass
with
a
mere
glance
the
next
group
showed
a
sprinkling
of
women
women
whose
trig
hats
and
linen
collars
spelled
promptness
as
well
as
certainty
of
aim
and
accomplishment
to
these
also
billy
paid
scant
attention
couples
came
next
the
men
and
usually
walking
two
steps
ahead
of
their
companions
the
women
plainly
flustered
and
hurried
and
invariably
buttoning
gloves
or
gathering
up
trailing
ends
of
scarfs
or
boas
the
crowd
was
thickening
fast
now
and
billy
eyes
were
alert
children
were
appearing
and
young
women
walking
alone
one
of
these
wore
a
bunch
of
violets
billy
gave
her
a
second
glance
then
she
saw
a
pink
but
it
was
on
the
coat
lapel
of
a
tall
young
fellow
with
a
brown
beard
so
with
a
slight
frown
she
looked
beyond
down
the
line
old
men
came
now
and
old
women
fleshy
women
and
women
with
small
children
and
babies
couples
came
too
dawdling
couples
plainly
newly
married
the
men
were
not
two
steps
ahead
and
the
women
gloves
were
buttoned
and
their
furs
in
place
gradually
the
line
thinned
and
soon
there
were
left
only
an
old
man
with
a
cane
and
a
young
woman
with
three
children
yet
nowhere
had
billy
seen
a
girl
wearing
a
white
carnation
and
walking
alone
with
a
deeper
frown
on
her
face
billy
turned
and
looked
about
her
she
thought
that
somewhere
in
the
crowd
she
had
missed
mary
jane
and
that
she
would
find
her
now
standing
near
but
there
was
no
one
standing
near
except
the
young
fellow
with
the
little
pointed
brown
beard
who
as
billy
noticed
a
second
time
was
wearing
a
white
carnation
as
she
glanced
toward
him
their
eyes
met
then
to
billy
unbounded
amazement
the
man
advanced
with
uplifted
hat
i
beg
your
pardon
but
is
not
this
miss
neilson
billy
drew
back
with
just
a
touch
of
hauteur
she
murmured
i
thought
so
yet
i
was
expecting
to
see
you
with
aunt
hannah
i
am
arkwright
miss
for
a
brief
instant
billy
stared
dazedly
you
do
mean
mary
jane
she
gasped
i
afraid
i
his
lips
twitched
but
i
thought
we
were
expecting
she
stopped
helplessly
for
one
more
brief
instant
she
stared
then
suddenly
a
swift
change
came
to
her
face
her
eyes
danced
oh
oh
she
chuckled
how
perfectly
funny
you
evened
things
up
after
all
to
think
that
mary
jane
should
be
a
she
paused
and
flashed
almost
angrily
suspicious
eyes
into
his
face
but
mine
she
cried
your
name
is
really
mary
jane
i
am
often
called
his
brown
eyes
twinkled
but
they
did
not
swerve
from
their
direct
gaze
into
her
own
but
billy
hesitated
and
turned
her
eyes
away
she
saw
then
that
many
curious
glances
were
already
being
flung
in
her
direction
the
color
in
her
cheeks
deepened
with
an
odd
little
gesture
she
seemed
to
toss
something
aside
never
mind
she
laughed
a
little
hysterically
if
you
pick
up
your
bag
please
mary
jane
and
come
with
me
john
and
peggy
are
waiting
or
i
forgot
you
have
a
trunk
of
course
the
man
raised
a
protesting
hand
thank
you
but
miss
neilson
really
i
could
think
of
trespassing
on
your
hospitality
now
you
but
we
we
invited
you
stammered
billy
he
shook
his
head
you
invited
mary
billy
bubbled
into
low
laughter
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
funny
she
sighed
you
see
came
once
just
the
same
way
and
now
to
have
the
tables
turned
like
this
what
will
aunt
hannah
say
what
will
everybody
say
come
i
want
them
to
begin
to
say
it
she
chuckled
irrepressibly
thank
you
but
i
shall
go
to
a
hotel
of
course
later
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
call
and
explain
but
i
afraid
aunt
hannah
will
think
billy
stopped
abruptly
some
distance
away
she
saw
john
coming
toward
them
she
turned
hurriedly
to
the
man
at
her
side
her
eyes
still
danced
but
her
voice
was
mockingly
serious
really
mary
jane
i
afraid
you
have
to
come
to
dinner
then
you
can
settle
the
rest
with
aunt
hannah
john
is
almost
upon
us
and
do
want
to
make
explanations
do
you
john
she
said
airily
to
the
somewhat
dazed
chauffeur
who
had
been
told
he
was
to
meet
a
young
woman
take
arkwright
bag
please
and
show
him
where
peggy
is
waiting
it
will
be
five
minutes
perhaps
before
i
can
come
if
you
kindly
excuse
me
she
added
to
arkwright
with
a
flashing
glance
from
merry
eyes
i
have
some
telephoning
to
all
the
way
to
the
telephone
booth

was
trying
to
bring
order
out
of
the
chaos
of
her
mind
but
all
the
way
too
she
was
chuckling
to
think
that
this
thing
should
have
happened
to
she
said
almost
aloud
and
here
i
am
telephoning
just
like
uncle
william
bertram

due
course

had
aunt
hannah
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
aunt
hannah

but
it
happened
mary
jane

a
billy

a
dismayed
gasp
and
a
muttered
oh

grief
and
conscience
then
a
shaking
i
say
mary
jane

a
billy
was
enjoying
herself
hugely
a
yes

great
big
man
with
a
brown
beard
he
waiting
now
with
john
and
i
must
but
billy
i
do
understand
chattered
an
agitated
voice
over
the
line
he
he
called
himself
jane
he
has
any
business
to
be
a
big
man
with
a
brown
beard
what
shall

we
do

a
big
man
with
a
brown
beard

billy
laughed
roguishly
i
do
know
asked
him
how
he
will
like
that
little
blue
room
aunt
hannah
billy
voice
turned
suddenly
tragic
for
sake
take
out
those
curling
tongs
and
hairpins
and
the
i
hear
the
last
of
it
if
he
saw
those
i
know
he
just
that
kind
a
half
stifled
groan
came
over
the
wire
billy
he
ca
stay
billy
laughed
again
no
no
dear
he
wo
i
know
he
says
he
going
to
a
hotel
but
i
had
to
bring
him
home
to
dinner
there
was
no
other
way
under
the
circumstances
he
wo
stay
do
you
worry
but
i
must
go
those
curling
tongs
and
the
receiver
clicked
sharply
against
the
hook
in
the
automobile
some
minutes
later
billy
and
arkwright
were
speeding
toward
corey
hill
it
was
during
a
slight
pause
in
the
conversation
that
billy
turned
to
her
companion
with
a
demure
i
telephoned
aunt
hannah
arkwright
i
thought
she
ought
to
be
you
are
very
kind
what
did
she
say
if
i
may
there
was
a
brief
moment
of
hesitation
before
billy
answered
she
said
you
called
yourself
jane
and
that
you
had
any
business
to
be
a
big
man
with
a
brown
arkwright
laughed
i
afraid
i
owe
aunt
hannah
an
apology
he
said
he
hesitated
glanced
admiringly
at
the
glowing
face
near
him
then
went
on
decisively
he
wore
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
set
the
match
to
his
bridges
i
signed
both
letters
arkwright
but
in
the
first
one
i
quoted
a
remark
of
a
friend
and
in
that
remark
i
was
addressed
as
jane
i
did
not
know
but
aunt
hannah
knew
of
the
arkwright
was
speaking
a
little
slowly
now
as
if
weighing
his
words
but
when
she
answered
i
saw
that
she
did
not
for
from
something
she
said
i
realized
that
she
thought
i
was
a
real
mary
jane
for
the
joke
of
the
thing
i
let
it
pass
but
if
she
noticed
my
letter
carefully
she
saw
that
i
did
not
accept
your
kind
invitation
to
give
jane
a
yes
we
noticed
that
nodded
billy
merrily
but
we
did
think
you
meant
it
you
see
we
pictured
you
as
a
shy
young
thing
but
really
she
went
on
with
a
low
laugh
you
see
your
coming
as
a
masculine
jane
was
particularly
funny
for
me
for
though
perhaps
you
know
it
i
came
once
to
this
very
same
city
wearing
a
pink
and
was
expected
to
be
billy
a
boy
and
only
a
lady
warned
me
that
your
coming
might
even
things
up
but
i
did
believe
it
would
a
mary
jane
arkwright
laughed
again
he
hesitated
and
seemed
to
be
weighing
his
words
yes
i
heard
about
that
coming
of
yours
i
might
almost
say
that
why
i
let
the
mistake
pass
in
aunt
hannah
letter
he
said
billy
turned
with
reproachful
eyes
oh
how
could
you
but
then
it
was
a
temptation
she
laughed
suddenly
what
sinful
joy
you
must
have
had
watching
me
hunt
for
jane
i
did
acknowledged
the
other
with
unexpected
candor
i
felt
ashamed
and
when
i
saw
you
were
there
alone
without
aunt
hannah
i
came
very
near
not
speaking
at
all
until
i
realized
that
that
would
be
even
worse
under
the
of
course
it
would
smiled
billy
brightly
so
i
do
see
but
i
shall
have
to
forgive
you
after
all
and
here
we
are
at
home
mary
jane
by
the
way
what
did
you
say
that
j
did
stand
for
she
asked
as
the
car
came
to
a
stop
the
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
at
least
he
did
not
answer
he
was
helping
his
hostess
to
alight
a
moment
later
a
plainly
agitated
aunt
hannah
her
gray
shawl
topped
with
a
huge
black
one
opened
the
door
of
the
house
chapter
vii
old
friends
and
new
at
ten
minutes
before
six
on
the
afternoon
of
arkwright
arrival
billy
came
into
the
to
welcome
the
three
henshaw
brothers
who
as
was
frequently
the
case
were
dining
at
hillside
bertram
thought
billy
had
never
looked
prettier
than
she
did
this
afternoon
with
the
bronze
sheen
of
her
pretty
house
gown
bringing
out
the
bronze
lights
in
her
dark
eyes
and
in
the
soft
waves
of
her
beautiful
hair
her
countenance
too
carried
a
peculiar
something
that
the
artist
eye
was
quick
to
detect
and
that
the
artist
fingers
tingled
to
put
on
canvas
jove
billy
he
said
low
in
her
ear
as
he
greeted
her
i
wish
i
had
a
brush
in
my
hand
this
minute
i
have
a
of
a
girl
that
would
be
worth
while
billy
laughed
and
dimpled
her
appreciation
but
down
in
her
heart
she
was
conscious
of
a
vague
unrest
billy
wished
sometimes
that
she
did
not
so
often
seem
to
bertram
a
picture
she
turned
to
cyril
with
outstretched
hand
oh
yes
marie
coming
she
smiled
in
answer
to
the
quick
shifting
of
cyril
eyes
to
the
hall
doorway
and
aunt
hannah
too
and
mary
jane
demanded
william
a
little
anxiously
will
getting
nervous
volunteered
bertram
airily
he
wants
to
see
mary
jane
you
see
we
told
him
that
we
shall
expect
him
to
see
that
she
does
bother
us
four
too
much
you
know
he
expected
always
to
remove
her
quietly
but
effectually
whenever
he
sees
that
she
is
likely
to
interrupt
a
naturally
then
will
wants
to
see
mary
billy
began
to
laugh
hysterically
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
raised
both
her
hands
palms
outward
do
do
please
do
she
choked
or
i
shall
die
i
had
all
i
can
stand
all
you
can
stand
what
do
you
mean
is
she
so
impossible
this
last
was
from
bertram
spoken
softly
and
with
a
hurried
glance
toward
the
hall
billy
dropped
her
hands
and
lifted
her
head
by
heroic
effort
she
pulled
her
face
into
sobriety
all
but
her
eyes
and
announced
mary
jane
is
a
a
billy
three
masculine
forms
sat
suddenly
erect
yes
oh
uncle
william
i
know
now
just
how
you
felt
i
know
i
know
gurgled
billy
incoherently
there
he
stood
with
his
pink
just
as
i
did
only
he
had
a
brown
beard
and
he
did
have
spunk
and
i
had
to
telephone
to
prepare
folks
just
as
you
did
and
the
room
the
room
i
fixed
the
room
too
she
babbled
breathlessly
only
i
had
curling
tongs
and
hair
pins
in
it
instead
of
guns
and
spiders
child
child
what
you
talking
about
william
face
was
red
a
jane
cyril
was
merely
cross
billy
what
does
this
mean
bertram
had
grown
a
little
white
billy
began
to
laugh
again
yet
she
was
plainly
trying
to
control
herself
i
tell
you
i
must
tell
you
aunt
hannah
is
keeping
him
so
i
can
tell
you
she
panted
but
it
was
so
funny
when
i
expected
a
girl
you
know
to
see
him
with
his
brown
beard
and
he
was
so
tall
and
big
and
of
course
it
made
me
think
how
came
and
was
a
girl
when
you
expected
a
boy
and
carleton
had
just
said
that
maybe
this
girl
would
even
things
up
oh
it
was
so
funny
billy
dear
remonstrated
uncle
william
mildly
but
what
his
name
demanded
cyril
did
the
creature
sign
himself
jane
exploded
bertram
i
do
know
his
name
except
that
it
j
and
that
how
he
signed
the
letters
but
he
called
jane
sometimes
and
in
the
letter
he
quoted
somebody
speech
i
forgotten
just
how
but
in
it
he
was
called
jane
and
of
course
aunt
hannah
took
him
for
a
girl
explained
billy
grown
a
little
more
coherent
now
did
he
write
again
asked
william
well
why
did
he
correct
the
mistake
then
demanded
bertram
billy
chuckled
he
did
want
to
i
guess
he
thought
it
was
too
good
a
joke
scoffed
cyril
but
see
here
billy
he
is
going
to
live
here
now
voice
was
almost
savage
oh
no
he
is
going
to
live
here
now
interposed
smooth
tones
from
the
doorway
arkwright
breathed
billy
confusedly
three
men
sprang
to
their
feet
the
situation
for
a
moment
threatened
embarrassed
misery
for
all
concerned
but
arkwright
with
a
cheery
smile
advanced
straight
toward
bertram
and
held
out
a
friendly
hand
the
proverbial
fate
of
listeners
he
said
easily
but
i
do
blame
you
at
all
no
is
going
to
live
here
he
went
on
grasping
each
brother
hand
in
turn
as
billy
murmured
faint
introductions
and
what
is
more
he
hereby
asks
everybody
pardon
for
the
annoyance
his
little
joke
has
caused
he
might
add
that
he
of
himself
as
well
but
if
any
of
you
arkwright
turned
to
the
three
tall
men
still
standing
by
their
chairs
if
any
of
you
had
suffered
what
he
has
at
the
hands
of
a
swarm
of
youngsters
for
that
name
sake
you
would
blame
him
for
being
tempted
to
get
what
fun
he
could
out
of
mary
jane
if
there
ever
came
a
chance
naturally
after
this
there
could
be
nothing
stiff
or
embarrassing
billy
laughed
in
relief
and
motioned
arkwright
to
a
seat
near
her
william
said
of
course
of
course
and
shook
hands
again
bertram
and
cyril
laughed
shamefacedly
and
sat
down
somebody
said
but
what
does
the
j
stand
for
anyhow
nobody
answered
this
however
perhaps
because
aunt
hannah
and
marie
appeared
just
then
in
the
doorway
dinner
proved
to
be
a
lively
meal
in
the
newcomer
bertram
met
his
match
for
wit
and
satire
and
mr
mary
jane
as
he
was
promptly
called
by
every
one
but
aunt
hannah
was
found
to
be
a
most
entertaining
guest
after
dinner
somebody
suggested
music
cyril
frowned
and
got
up
abruptly
still
frowning
he
turned
to
a
bookcase
near
him
and
began
to
take
down
and
examine
some
of
the
books
bertram
twinkled
and
glanced
at
billy
which
is
it
cyril
he
called
with
cheerful
impertinence
stool
piano
or
audience
that
is
the
matter
only
a
shrug
from
cyril
answered
you
see
explained
bertram
jauntily
to
arkwright
whose
eyes
were
slightly
puzzled
cyril
never
plays
unless
the
piano
and
the
pedals
and
the
weather
and
your
ears
and
my
watch
and
his
fingers
are
just
right
nonsense
scorned
cyril
dropping
his
book
and
walking
back
to
his
chair
i
do
feel
like
playing
that
you
see
nodded
bertram
again
i
see
bowed
arkwright
with
quiet
amusement
i
believe
mary
jane
sings
observed
billy
at
this
point
demurely
why
yes
of
course
chimed
in
aunt
hannah
with
some
nervousness
that
what
she
i
mean
he
was
coming
to
boston
for
to
study
everybody
laughed
wo
you
sing
please
asked
billy
can
you
without
your
notes
i
have
lots
of
songs
if
you
want
for
a
moment
but
only
a
moment
arkwright
hesitated
then
he
rose
and
went
to
the
piano
with
the
easy
sureness
of
the
trained
musician
his
fingers
dropped
to
the
keys
and
slid
into
preliminary
chords
and
arpeggios
to
test
the
touch
of
the
piano
then
with
a
sweetness
and
purity
that
made
every
listener
turn
in
amazed
delight
a
tenor
began
the
the
leaves
the
night
winds
moving
of
schubert
serenade
cyril
chin
had
lifted
at
the
first
tone
he
was
listening
now
with
very
obvious
pleasure
bertram
too
was
showing
by
his
attitude
the
keenest
appreciation
william
and
aunt
hannah
resting
back
in
their
chairs
were
contentedly
nodding
their
approval
to
each
other
marie
in
her
corner
was
motionless
with
rapture
as
to
billy
billy
was
plainly
oblivious
of
everything
but
the
song
and
the
singer
she
seemed
scarcely
to
move
or
to
breathe
till
the
song
completion
then
there
came
a
low
oh
how
beautiful
through
her
parted
lips
bertram
looking
at
her
was
conscious
of
a
vague
irritation
arkwright
you
a
lucky
dog
he
declared
almost
crossly
i
wish
i
could
sing
like
that
i
wish
i
could
paint
a
of
a
girl
smiled
the
tenor
as
he
turned
from
the
piano
oh
but
arkwright
do
stop
objected
billy
springing
to
her
feet
and
going
to
her
music
cabinet
by
the
piano
there
a
little
song
of
nevin
i
want
you
to
sing
there
here
it
is
just
let
me
play
it
for
and
she
slipped
into
the
place
the
singer
had
just
left
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
after
nevin
came
de
koven
and
after
de
koven
gounod
then
came
nevin
again
billy
still
playing
the
accompaniment
next
followed
a
duet
billy
did
not
consider
herself
much
of
a
singer
but
her
voice
was
sweet
and
true
and
not
without
training
it
blended
very
prettily
with
the
clear
pure
tenor
william
and
aunt
hannah
still
smiled
contentedly
in
their
chairs
though
aunt
hannah
had
reached
for
the
pink
shawl
near
her
the
music
had
sent
little
shivers
down
her
spine
cyril
with
marie
had
slipped
into
the
little
across
the
hall
ostensibly
to
look
at
some
plans
for
a
house
although
as
everybody
knew
they
were
not
intending
to
build
for
a
year
bertram
still
sitting
stiffly
erect
in
his
chair
was
not
conscious
of
a
vague
irritation
now
he
was
conscious
of
a
very
real
and
a
very
decided
one
an
irritation
that
was
directed
against
himself
against
billy
and
against
this
man
arkwright
but
chiefly
against
music
he
hated
music
he
wished
he
could
sing
he
wondered
how
long
it
took
to
teach
a
man
to
sing
anyhow
and
he
wondered
if
a
man
could
sing
who
never
had
sung
at
this
point
the
duet
came
to
an
end
and
billy
and
her
guest
left
the
piano
almost
at
once
after
this
arkwright
made
his
very
graceful
adieus
and
went
off
with
his
to
the
hotel
where
as
he
had
informed
aunt
hannah
his
room
was
already
engaged
william
went
home
then
and
aunt
hannah
went
cyril
and
marie
withdrew
into
a
still
more
secluded
corner
to
look
at
their
plans
and
bertram
found
himself
at
last
alone
with
billy
he
forgot
then
in
the
blissful
hour
he
spent
with
her
before
the
open
fire
how
he
hated
music
though
he
did
say
just
before
he
went
home
that
night
billy
how
long
does
it
take
to
learn
to
sing
why
i
do
know
i
sure
replied
billy
abstractedly
then
with
sudden
fervor
oh
bertram
has
mary
jane
a
beautiful
voice
bertram
wished
then
he
had
not
asked
the
question
but
all
he
said
was
mary
jane
indeed
what
an
absurd
name
but
does
he
sing
beautifully
eh
oh
yes
he
sings
all
right
said
bertram
tongue
manner
said
oh
yes
anybody
can
chapter
viii
j
opens
the
game
on
the
morning
after
cyril
first
concert
of
the
season
billy
sat
sewing
with
aunt
hannah
in
the
little
at
the
end
of
the
hall
upstairs
aunt
hannah
wore
only
one
shawl
this
morning
which
meant
that
she
was
feeling
unusually
well
marie
ought
to
be
here
to
mend
these
stockings
remarked
billy
as
she
critically
examined
a
tiny
break
in
the
black
silk
mesh
stretched
across
the
in
her
hand
only
she
want
a
bigger
hole
she
does
so
love
to
make
a
beautiful
black
latticework
bridge
across
a
yawning
white
china
sea
and
you
think
the
safety
of
an
army
depended
on
the
way
each
plank
was
laid
too
she
concluded
aunt
hannah
smiled
tranquilly
but
she
did
not
speak
i
suppose
you
do
happen
to
know
if
cyril
does
wear
big
holes
in
his
socks
resumed
billy
after
a
moment
silence
if
you
believe
it
that
thought
popped
into
my
head
last
night
when
cyril
was
playing
that
concerto
so
superbly
it
did
actually
right
in
the
middle
of
the
adagio
movement
too
and
in
spite
of
my
joy
and
pride
in
the
music
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
nudging
marie
right
there
and
then
and
asking
her
whether
or
not
the
dear
man
was
hard
on
his
billy
gasped
the
shocked
aunt
hannah
but
the
gasp
broke
at
once
into
what
in
aunt
hannah
passed
for
a
chuckle
if
i
remember
rightly
when
i
was
there
at
the
house
with
you
at
first
my
dear
william
told
me
that
cyril
would
wear
any
sock
after
it
came
to
horrors
billy
waved
her
stocking
in
mock
despair
that
will
never
do
in
the
world
it
would
break
marie
heart
you
know
how
she
dotes
on
yes
i
know
smiled
aunt
hannah
by
the
way
where
is
she
this
morning
billy
raised
her
eyebrows
quizzically
gone
to
look
at
an
apartment
in
cambridge
i
believe
really
aunt
hannah
between
her
in
the
morning
and
her
hunting
in
the
afternoon
and
her
poring
over
in
the
evening
i
ca
get
her
to
attend
to
her
clothes
at
all
never
did
i
see
a
bride
so
utterly
indifferent
to
her
trousseau
as
marie
hawthorn
and
her
wedding
less
than
a
month
away
but
she
been
shopping
with
you
once
or
twice
since
she
came
back
has
she
and
she
said
it
was
for
her
billy
laughed
her
trousseau
oh
yes
it
was
i
tell
you
what
she
got
for
her
trousseau
that
first
day
we
started
out
to
buy
two
hats
some
lace
for
her
wedding
gown
some
crêpe
de
chine
and
net
for
a
little
dinner
frock
and
some
silk
for
a
couple
of
waists
to
go
with
her
tailored
suit
and
what
did
we
get
we
purchased
a
and
a
set
of
cake
tins
marie
got
into
the
kitchen
department
and
i
simply
could
get
her
out
of
it
but
the
next
day
i
was
not
to
be
inveigled
below
stairs
by
any
plaintive
prayer
for
a
or
a
soda
spoon
she
that
day
and
to
some
purpose
we
accomplished
aunt
hannah
looked
a
little
concerned
but
she
must
have
things
started
oh
she
has
everything
now
seen
to
that
of
course
her
outfit
is
very
simple
anyway
marie
has
much
money
you
know
and
she
simply
wo
let
me
do
half
what
i
want
to
still
she
had
saved
up
some
money
and
i
finally
convinced
her
that
a
trousseau
consist
of
and
cake
tins
and
that
cyril
would
want
her
to
look
pretty
that
name
will
fetch
her
every
time
and
i
learned
to
use
it
beautifully
i
think
if
i
told
her
cyril
approved
of
short
hair
and
she
i
cut
off
her
golden
locks
and
don
spectacles
on
the
aunt
hannah
laughed
softly
what
a
child
you
are
billy
besides
just
as
if
marie
were
the
only
one
in
the
house
who
is
ruled
by
a
magic
name
the
color
deepened
in
billy
cheeks
well
of
course
any
girl
cares
something
for
the
man
she
loves
just
as
if
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
i
could
for
bertram
oh
that
makes
me
think
who
was
that
young
woman
bertram
was
talking
with
last
evening
just
after
he
left
us
i
mean
miss
winthrop
miss
marguerite
winthrop
bertram
is
is
painting
her
portrait
you
oh
is
that
the
one
murmured
aunt
hannah
well
she
has
a
beautiful
yes
she
billy
spoke
very
cheerfully
she
even
hummed
a
little
tune
as
she
carefully
selected
a
needle
from
the
cushion
in
her
basket
there
a
peculiar
something
in
her
face
mused
aunt
hannah
aloud
the
little
tune
stopped
abruptly
ending
in
a
nervous
laugh
dear
me
i
wonder
how
it
feels
to
have
a
peculiar
something
in
your
face
bertram
too
says
she
has
it
he
trying
to
it
he
says
i
wonder
now
if
he
does
catch
it
does
she
lose
it
flippant
as
were
the
words
the
voice
that
uttered
them
shook
a
little
aunt
hannah
smiled
indulgently
aunt
hannah
had
heard
only
the
flippancy
not
the
shake
i
do
know
my
dear
you
might
ask
him
this
billy
made
a
sudden
movement
the
china
egg
in
her
lap
rolled
to
the
floor
oh
but
i
do
see
him
this
afternoon
she
said
lightly
as
she
stooped
to
pick
up
the
egg
why
i
sure
he
told
me
aunt
hannah
sentence
ended
in
a
questioning
pause
yes
i
know
nodded
billy
brightly
but
he
told
me
something
since
he
is
going
he
telephoned
me
this
morning
miss
winthrop
wanted
the
sitting
changed
from
to
this
afternoon
he
said
he
knew
i
why
yes
but
aunt
hannah
did
not
finish
her
sentence
the
whir
of
an
electric
bell
had
sounded
through
the
house
a
few
moments
later
rosa
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
it
arkwright
miss
he
said
as
how
he
had
brought
the
music
she
announced
tell
him
i
be
down
at
once
directed
the
mistress
of
hillside
as
the
maid
disappeared
billy
put
aside
her
work
and
sprang
lightly
to
her
feet
now
was
that
nice
of
him
we
were
talking
last
night
about
some
duets
he
had
and
he
said
he
bring
them
over
i
did
know
he
come
so
soon
billy
had
almost
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
when
a
low
familiar
strain
of
music
drifted
out
from
the
billy
caught
her
breath
and
held
her
foot
suspended
the
next
moment
the
familiar
strain
of
music
had
become
a
lullaby
one
of
billy
own
and
sung
now
by
a
melting
tenor
voice
that
lingered
caressingly
and
understandingly
on
every
tender
cadence
motionless
and
almost
breathless
billy
waited
until
the
last
low
vibrated
into
silence
then
with
shining
eyes
and
outstretched
hands
she
entered
the
oh
that
was
beautiful
she
breathed
arkwright
was
on
his
feet
instantly
his
eyes
too
were
alight
i
could
not
resist
singing
it
just
once
here
he
said
a
little
unsteadily
as
their
hands
met
but
to
hear
my
little
song
sung
like
that
i
could
believe
it
was
mine
choked
billy
still
plainly
very
much
moved
you
sang
it
as
never
heard
it
sung
arkwright
shook
his
head
slowly
the
inspiration
of
the
room
that
is
all
he
said
it
is
a
beautiful
song
all
of
your
songs
are
billy
blushed
rosily
thank
you
you
know
more
of
them
then
i
think
i
know
them
all
unless
you
have
some
new
ones
out
have
you
some
new
ones
lately
billy
shook
her
head
no
i
have
written
anything
since
last
but
you
going
to
she
drew
a
long
sigh
yes
oh
yes
i
know
that
with
a
swift
biting
of
her
lower
lip
billy
caught
herself
up
in
time
as
if
she
could
tell
this
man
this
stranger
what
she
had
told
bertram
that
night
by
the
fire
that
she
knew
that
now
she
would
write
beautiful
songs
with
his
love
and
his
pride
in
her
as
incentives
oh
yes
i
think
i
shall
write
more
one
of
these
days
she
finished
lightly
but
come
this
is
singing
duets
i
want
to
see
the
music
you
they
sang
then
one
after
another
of
the
duets
to
billy
the
music
was
new
and
interesting
to
billy
too
it
was
new
and
interesting
to
hear
her
own
voice
blending
with
another
so
perfectly
to
feel
herself
a
part
of
such
exquisite
harmony
oh
oh
she
breathed
ecstatically
after
the
last
note
of
a
particularly
beautiful
phrase
i
never
knew
before
how
lovely
it
was
to
sing
nor
i
replied
arkwright
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
arkwright
eyes
were
on
the
enraptured
face
of
the
girl
so
near
him
it
was
well
perhaps
that
billy
did
not
happen
to
turn
and
catch
their
expression
still
it
might
have
been
better
if
she
had
turned
after
all
but
billy
eyes
were
on
the
music
before
her
her
fingers
were
busy
with
the
fluttering
pages
searching
for
another
duet
did
you
she
murmured
abstractedly
i
supposed
sung
them
before
but
you
see
i
never
did
until
the
other
night
there
let
try
this
one
this
one
was
followed
by
another
and
another
then
billy
drew
a
long
breath
there
that
must
positively
be
the
last
she
declared
reluctantly
i
so
hoarse
now
i
can
scarcely
croak
you
see
i
do
pretend
to
sing
do
you
you
sing
far
better
than
some
who
do
anyhow
retorted
the
man
warmly
thank
you
smiled
billy
that
was
nice
of
you
to
say
so
for
my
sake
and
the
others
are
here
to
care
but
tell
me
of
yourself
i
have
had
a
chance
to
ask
you
yet
and
i
think
you
said
mary
jane
was
going
to
study
for
grand
arkwright
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
is
but
as
i
told
calderwell
she
quite
likely
to
bring
up
in
calderwell
do
you
mean
hugh
calderwell
billy
cheeks
showed
a
deeper
color
the
man
gave
an
embarrassed
little
laugh
he
had
not
meant
to
let
that
name
slip
out
just
yet
he
hesitated
then
plunged
on
recklessly
we
tramped
half
over
europe
together
last
did
you
billy
left
her
seat
at
the
piano
for
one
nearer
the
fire
but
this
is
telling
me
about
your
own
plans
she
hurried
on
a
little
precipitately
you
studied
before
of
course
your
voice
shows
oh
yes
i
studied
singing
several
years
and
i
had
a
year
or
two
of
church
work
besides
a
little
concert
practice
of
a
mild
have
you
begun
here
yet
i
had
my
voice
billy
sat
erect
with
eager
interest
they
liked
it
of
course
arkwright
laughed
i
not
saying
no
but
i
am
declared
billy
with
conviction
they
could
help
liking
arkwright
laughed
again
just
how
well
they
had
liked
it
he
did
not
intend
to
say
their
remarks
had
been
quite
too
flattering
to
repeat
even
to
this
very
plainly
interested
young
woman
delightful
and
as
was
this
same
show
of
interest
to
himself
thank
you
was
all
he
said
billy
gave
an
excited
little
bounce
in
her
chair
and
you
begin
to
learn
rôles
right
away
i
already
have
some
after
a
fashion
before
i
came
really
how
splendid
why
then
you
be
acting
them
next
right
on
the
boston
opera
house
stage
and
we
all
go
to
hear
you
how
perfectly
lovely
i
can
hardly
arkwright
laughed
but
his
eyes
glowed
with
pleasure
are
you
hurrying
things
a
little
he
ventured
but
they
do
let
the
students
appear
argued
billy
i
knew
a
girl
last
year
who
went
on
in
and
she
was
a
pupil
at
the
school
she
sang
first
in
a
sunday
concert
then
they
put
her
in
the
bill
for
a
saturday
night
she
did
splendidly
so
well
that
they
gave
her
a
chance
later
at
a
subscription
performance
oh
you
be
there
and
soon
too
thank
you
i
only
wish
the
powers
that
could
put
me
there
had
your
flattering
enthusiasm
on
the
matter
he
smiled
i
do
worry
any
nodded
billy
only
please
do
too
soon
not
before
the
wedding
you
know
she
added
jokingly
we
shall
be
too
busy
to
give
you
proper
attention
until
after
a
peculiar
look
crossed
arkwright
face
the
he
asked
a
little
faintly
yes
did
you
know
my
friend
miss
hawthorn
is
to
marry
cyril
henshaw
next
the
man
opposite
relaxed
visibly
oh
hawthorn
no
i
did
know
he
murmured
then
with
sudden
astonishment
he
added
and
to
cyril
the
musician
did
you
say
yes
you
seem
i
arkwright
paused
then
went
on
almost
defiantly
you
see
calderwell
was
telling
me
only
last
september
how
very
unmarriageable
all
the
henshaw
brothers
were
so
i
am
surprised
naturally
finished
arkwright
as
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
a
swift
crimson
stained
billy
face
but
surely
you
must
know
that
that
that
he
has
a
right
to
change
his
mind
of
course
supplemented
arkwright
smilingly
coming
to
her
rescue
in
the
evident
confusion
that
would
not
let
her
finish
her
sentence
but
calderwell
made
it
so
emphatic
you
see
about
all
the
brothers
he
said
that
william
had
lost
his
heart
long
ago
that
cyril
had
any
to
lose
and
that
bertram
but
arkwright
bertram
is
is
billy
had
moistened
her
lips
and
plunged
hurriedly
in
to
prevent
arkwright
next
words
but
again
was
she
unable
to
finish
her
sentence
and
again
was
she
forced
to
listen
to
a
very
different
completion
from
the
smiling
lips
of
the
man
at
her
side
is
an
artist
of
course
said
arkwright
that
what
calderwell
declared
that
it
would
always
be
the
tilt
of
a
chin
or
the
curve
of
a
cheek
that
the
artist
loved
to
billy
drew
back
suddenly
her
face
paled
as
if
she
could
tell
this
man
that
bertram
henshaw
was
engaged
to
her
he
would
find
it
out
soon
of
course
for
himself
and
perhaps
he
like
hugh
calderwell
would
think
it
was
the
curve
of
cheek
or
the
tilt
of
chin
billy
lifted
her
chin
very
defiantly
now
as
she
held
out
her
hand
in
chapter
ix
a
rug
a
picture
and
a
girl
afraid
thanksgiving
came
once
again
the
henshaw
brothers
invited
billy
and
aunt
hannah
to
spend
the
day
with
them
this
time
however
there
was
to
be
an
additional
guest
present
in
the
person
of
marie
hawthorn
and
what
a
day
it
was
for
everything
and
everybody
concerned
first
the
strata
itself
from
dong
ling
kitchen
in
the
basement
to
domain
on
the
top
floor
the
house
was
as
as
pete
eager
old
hands
could
make
it
in
the
and
in
bertram
den
and
studio
great
clusters
of
pink
roses
perfumed
the
air
and
brightened
the
sombre
richness
of
the
furnishings
before
the
open
fire
in
the
den
a
sleek
gray
cat
adorned
with
a
huge
ribbon
bow
the
exact
shade
of
the
roses
bertram
had
seen
to
that
winked
and
blinked
sleepy
yellow
eyes
in
bertram
studio
the
latest
face
of
a
girl
had
made
way
for
a
group
of
canvases
and
plaques
every
one
of
which
showed
billy
neilson
in
one
pose
or
another
where
william
chaos
of
treasures
filled
shelves
and
cabinets
the
place
of
honor
was
given
to
a
small
black
velvet
square
on
which
rested
a
pair
of
quaint
battersea
enamel
mirror
knobs
in
cyril
rooms
usually
so
austerely
bare
a
handsome
oriental
rug
and
several
chairs
hinted
at
purchases
made
at
the
instigation
of
a
taste
other
than
his
own
when
the
doorbell
rang
pete
admitted
the
ladies
with
a
promptness
that
was
suggestive
of
surreptitious
watching
at
some
window
on
face
the
dignity
of
his
high
office
and
the
delight
of
the
moment
were
fighting
for
mastery
the
dignity
held
firmly
through
friendly
greeting
but
it
fled
in
defeat
when
billy
neilson
stepped
over
the
threshold
with
a
cheery
good
morning
laws
but
it
good
to
be
seein
you
here
again
stammered
the
man
delight
now
in
sole
possession
she
be
coming
to
stay
one
of
these
days
pete
smiled
the
eldest
henshaw
hurrying
forward
i
wish
she
had
now
whispered
bertram
who
in
spite
of
quick
stride
had
reached
billy
side
first
from
the
stairway
came
the
patter
of
a
man
slippered
feet
the
rug
has
come
and
the
curtains
too
called
a
householder
sort
of
voice
that
few
would
have
recognized
as
belonging
to
cyril
henshaw
you
must
all
come
and
see
them
after
the
voice
apparently
spoke
to
everybody
but
the
eyes
of
the
owner
of
the
voice
plainly
saw
only
the
young
woman
who
stood
a
little
in
the
shadow
behind
billy
and
who
was
looking
about
her
now
as
at
something
a
little
fearsome
but
very
dear
you
know
i
never
been
where
you
live
before
explained
marie
hawthorn
in
a
low
vibrant
tone
when
cyril
bent
over
her
to
take
the
furs
from
her
shoulders
in
bertram
den
a
little
later
as
hosts
and
guests
advanced
toward
the
fire
the
sleek
gray
cat
rose
stretched
lazily
and
turned
her
head
with
majestic
condescension
well
spunkie
come
here
commanded
billy
snapping
her
fingers
at
the
creature
on
the
hearthrug
spunkie
when
i
am
your
mistress
you
have
to
change
either
your
name
or
your
nature
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
such
a
bunch
of
independent
moderation
as
you
masquerading
as
an
understudy
to
my
frisky
little
spunk
everybody
laughed
william
regarded
his
namesake
with
fond
eyes
as
he
said
spunkie
does
seem
to
be
the
cat
had
jumped
into
lap
with
a
air
that
was
unmistakable
and
to
bertram
adorable
bertram
eyes
as
they
rested
on
billy
were
even
fonder
than
were
his
brother
i
do
think
any
one
is
he
said
with
quiet
emphasis
billy
smiled
i
should
think
they
might
be
she
answered
only
think
how
dreadfully
upsetting
i
was
in
the
first
place
william
beaming
face
grew
a
little
stern
nobody
knew
it
but
kate
and
she
did
it
she
only
imagined
it
he
said
tersely
billy
shook
her
head
i
not
so
sure
she
demurred
as
i
look
back
at
it
now
i
think
i
can
discern
a
few
evidences
myself
that
i
was
upsetting
i
was
a
bother
to
bertram
in
his
painting
i
am
you
were
an
inspiration
corrected
bertram
think
of
the
posing
you
did
for
a
swift
something
like
a
shadow
crossed
billy
face
but
before
her
lover
could
question
its
meaning
it
was
gone
and
i
know
i
was
a
torment
to
billy
had
turned
to
the
musician
now
well
i
admit
you
were
a
little
upsetting
at
times
retorted
that
individual
with
something
of
his
old
imperturbable
rudeness
nonsense
cut
in
william
sharply
you
were
never
anything
but
a
comfort
in
the
house
billy
my
dear
and
you
never
will
thank
you
murmured
billy
demurely
i
remember
that
when
pete
and
i
disagree
about
the
table
decorations
and
dong
ling
does
like
the
way
i
want
my
soup
an
anxious
frown
showed
on
bertram
face
billy
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
the
others
laughed
at
her
sally
you
need
have
pete
nor
dong
ling
here
if
you
do
want
do
want
them
echoed
billy
indignantly
of
course
i
want
them
but
pete
old
and
yes
and
where
he
grown
old
for
whom
has
he
worked
the
last
fifty
years
while
he
been
growing
old
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
let
pete
leave
this
house
as
long
as
he
to
stay
as
for
dong
ling
a
sudden
movement
of
bertram
hand
arrested
her
words
she
looked
up
to
find
pete
in
the
doorway
dinner
is
served
sir
announced
the
old
butler
his
eyes
on
his
master
face
william
rose
with
alacrity
and
gave
his
arm
to
aunt
hannah
well
i
sure
we
ready
for
dinner
he
declared
it
was
a
good
dinner
and
it
was
well
served
it
could
scarcely
have
been
otherwise
with
dong
ling
in
the
kitchen
and
pete
in
the
doing
their
utmost
to
please
but
even
had
the
turkey
been
tough
instead
of
tender
and
even
had
the
pies
been
filled
with
sawdust
instead
of
with
delicious
mincemeat
it
is
doubtful
if
four
at
the
table
would
have
known
the
difference
cyril
and
marie
at
one
end
were
discussing
where
to
put
their
new
sideboard
in
their
and
bertram
and
billy
at
the
other
were
talking
of
the
next
thanksgiving
when
according
to
bertram
the
strata
would
have
the
dearest
little
mistress
that
ever
was
as
if
under
these
circumstances
the
tenderness
of
the
turkey
or
the
toothsomeness
of
the
mince
pie
mattered
to
aunt
hannah
and
william
in
the
centre
of
the
table
however
it
did
matter
so
it
was
well
of
course
that
the
dinner
was
a
good
one
and
now
said
cyril
when
dinner
was
over
suppose
you
come
up
and
see
the
in
compliance
with
this
suggestion
the
six
trailed
up
the
long
flights
of
stairs
then
billy
carrying
an
extra
shawl
for
aunt
hannah
rooms
were
always
cool
oh
yes
i
knew
we
should
need
it
she
nodded
to
bertram
as
she
picked
up
the
shawl
from
the
hall
stand
where
she
had
left
it
when
she
came
in
that
why
i
brought
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
cyril
how
you
stand
it
to
climb
stairs
like
this
panted
aunt
hannah
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
last
flight
and
dropped
breathlessly
into
the
nearest
chair
from
which
marie
had
rescued
a
curtain
just
in
time
well
i
not
sure
i
could
if
i
were
always
to
eat
a
thanksgiving
dinner
just
before
laughed
cyril
maybe
i
ought
to
have
waited
and
let
you
rest
an
hour
or
but
have
been
too
dark
then
to
see
the
rug
objected
marie
it
a
genuine
persian
a
kirman
you
know
and
i
so
proud
of
it
she
added
turning
to
the
others
i
wanted
you
to
see
the
colors
by
daylight
cyril
likes
it
better
anyhow
in
the
fancy
cyril
any
sort
of
a
rug
at
any
time
chuckled
bertram
his
eyes
on
the
rich
softly
blended
colors
of
the
rug
before
him
honestly
miss
marie
he
added
turning
to
the
little
bride
elect
how
did
you
ever
manage
to
get
him
to
buy
rug
he
wo
have
so
much
as
a
ravelling
on
the
floor
up
here
to
walk
a
startled
dismay
came
into
marie
blue
eyes
why
i
thought
he
wanted
rugs
she
faltered
i
sure
he
said
of
course
i
want
rugs
interrupted
cyril
irritably
i
want
them
everywhere
except
in
my
own
especial
den
you
do
suppose
i
want
to
hear
other
people
clattering
over
bare
floors
all
day
do
you
of
course
not
bertram
face
was
preternaturally
grave
as
he
turned
to
the
little
music
teacher
i
hope
miss
marie
that
you
wear
rubber
heels
on
your
shoes
he
observed
solicitously
even
cyril
laughed
at
this
though
all
he
said
was
come
come
i
got
you
up
here
to
look
at
the
bertram
however
was
not
to
be
silenced
and
another
thing
miss
marie
he
resumed
with
the
air
of
a
true
and
tried
adviser
just
let
me
give
you
a
pointer
i
lived
with
your
future
husband
a
good
many
years
and
i
know
what
i
talking
bertram
be
still
growled
cyril
bertram
refused
to
be
still
whenever
you
want
to
know
anything
about
cyril
listen
to
his
playing
for
instance
if
after
dinner
you
hear
a
dreamy
waltz
or
a
sleepy
nocturne
you
may
know
that
all
is
well
but
if
on
your
ears
there
falls
anything
like
a
dirge
or
the
wail
of
a
lost
spirit
gone
mad
better
look
to
your
soup
and
see
if
it
has
been
scorched
or
taste
of
your
pudding
and
see
if
you
did
put
in
salt
instead
of
bertram
will
you
be
still
cut
in
cyril
testily
again
after
all
judging
from
what
billy
tells
me
resumed
bertram
cheerfully
what
i
said
wo
be
so
important
to
you
for
you
the
kind
that
scorches
soups
or
uses
salt
for
sugar
so
maybe
i
better
put
it
to
you
this
way
if
you
want
a
new
sealskin
coat
or
an
extra
diamond
tiara
tackle
him
when
he
plays
like
this
and
with
a
swift
turn
bertram
dropped
himself
to
the
piano
stool
and
dashed
into
a
rollicking
melody
that
half
the
newsboys
of
boston
were
whistling
what
happened
next
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
bertram
very
much
as
if
he
were
a
naughty
little
boy
was
jerked
by
a
wrathful
brother
hand
off
the
piano
stool
the
next
moment
the
wrathful
brother
himself
sat
at
the
piano
and
there
burst
on
five
pairs
of
astonished
ears
a
crashing
dissonance
which
was
but
the
prelude
to
music
such
as
few
of
the
party
often
heard
spellbound
they
listened
while
rippling
runs
and
sonorous
harmonies
filled
the
room
to
overflowing
as
if
under
the
fingers
of
the
player
there
were
not
the
keyboard
of
a
piano
but
the
violins
flutes
cornets
trombones
bass
viols
and
kettledrums
of
a
full
orchestra
billy
perhaps
of
them
all
best
understood
she
knew
that
in
those
tripping
melodies
and
crashing
chords
were
cyril
joy
at
the
presence
of
marie
his
wrath
at
the
flippancy
of
bertram
his
ecstasy
at
that
for
which
the
rug
and
curtains
stood
the
little
woman
sewing
in
the
radiant
circle
of
a
shaded
lamp
billy
knew
that
all
this
and
more
were
finding
voice
at
cyril
finger
tips
the
others
too
understood
in
a
way
but
they
unlike
billy
were
not
in
the
habit
of
finding
on
a
few
score
bits
of
wood
and
ivory
a
vent
for
their
moods
and
fancies
the
music
was
softer
now
the
resounding
chords
and
purling
runs
had
become
a
melody
that
wound
itself
in
and
out
of
a
maze
of
exquisite
harmonies
now
hiding
now
coming
out
clear
and
unafraid
like
a
mountain
stream
emerging
into
a
sunlit
meadow
from
the
leafy
shadows
of
its
forest
home
in
a
breathless
hush
the
melody
quivered
into
silence
it
was
bertram
who
broke
the
pause
with
a
by
george
then
a
little
unsteadily
if
it
i
that
set
you
going
like
that
old
chap
i
come
up
and
play
ragtime
every
day
cyril
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
got
to
his
feet
if
you
seen
all
you
want
of
the
rug
we
go
he
said
nonchalantly
but
we
have
chorussed
several
indignant
voices
and
for
the
next
few
minutes
not
even
the
owner
of
the
beautiful
kirman
could
find
any
fault
with
the
quantity
or
the
quality
of
the
attention
bestowed
on
his
new
possession
but
billy
under
cover
of
the
chatter
said
reproachfully
in
his
ear
oh
cyril
to
think
you
can
play
like
that
and
wo
on
demand
i
ca
on
demand
shrugged
cyril
again
on
the
way
they
stopped
at
william
rooms
i
want
you
to
see
a
couple
of
batterseas
i
got
last
week
cried
the
collector
eagerly
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
black
velvet
square
they
fine
and
i
think
she
looks
like
you
he
finished
turning
to
billy
and
holding
out
one
of
the
knobs
on
which
was
a
beautifully
executed
miniature
of
a
young
girl
with
dark
dreamy
eyes
oh
how
pretty
exclaimed
marie
over
billy
shoulder
but
what
are
they
the
collector
turned
his
face
alight
mirror
knobs
i
got
lots
of
them
would
you
like
to
see
them
really
they
right
the
next
minute
marie
found
herself
looking
into
a
cabinet
where
lay
a
score
or
more
of
round
and
oval
discs
of
glass
porcelain
and
metal
framed
in
silver
gilt
and
brass
and
mounted
on
long
spikes
oh
how
pretty
cried
marie
again
but
how
how
queer
tell
me
about
them
william
drew
a
long
breath
his
eyes
glistened
william
loved
to
talk
when
he
had
a
curio
and
a
listener
i
will
our
used
them
you
know
to
support
their
mirrors
or
to
fasten
back
their
curtains
he
explained
ardently
now
here
another
battersea
enamel
but
it
is
so
good
as
my
new
ones
that
face
is
almost
a
but
what
a
beautiful
ship
on
that
round
one
exclaimed
marie
and
what
this
one
glass
yes
but
that
not
so
rare
as
the
others
still
it
pretty
enough
did
you
notice
this
one
with
the
bright
red
and
blue
and
green
on
the
white
background
regular
chinese
mode
of
decoration
that
er
any
time
william
began
bertram
mischievously
but
william
did
not
seem
to
hear
now
in
this
corner
he
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
are
the
enamelled
porcelains
they
were
probably
made
at
the
worcester
works
england
you
know
and
i
think
many
of
them
are
quite
as
pretty
as
the
batterseas
you
see
it
was
at
worcester
that
they
invented
that
variation
of
the
transfer
printing
process
that
they
called
bat
printing
where
they
used
oil
instead
of
ink
and
gelatine
instead
of
paper
now
engravings
for
that
kind
of
printing
were
usually
in
stipple
work
dots
you
know
so
the
prints
on
these
knobs
can
easily
be
distinguished
from
those
of
the
transfer
printing
see
now
this
one
is
er
of
course
william
any
time
interposed
bertram
again
his
eyes
twinkling
william
stopped
with
a
laugh
yes
i
know
is
time
i
talked
of
something
else
bertram
he
conceded
but
was
lovely
and
i
interested
really
claimed
marie
besides
there
are
such
a
lot
of
things
here
that
i
like
to
see
she
finished
turning
slowly
about
these
are
what
he
was
collecting
last
year
murmured
billy
hovering
over
a
small
cabinet
where
were
some
beautiful
specimens
of
antique
jewelry
brooches
necklaces
armlets
rajah
rings
and
anklets
gorgeous
in
color
and
exquisite
in
workmanship
well
here
is
something
you
enjoy
declared
bertram
with
an
airy
flourish
do
you
see
those
teapots
well
we
can
have
tea
every
day
in
the
year
and
not
use
one
of
them
but
five
times
i
counted
there
are
exactly
he
concluded
as
he
laughingly
led
the
way
from
the
room
how
about
leap
year
quizzed
billy
ho
trust
will
to
find
another
blue
or
a
treasure
of
a
black
basalt
by
that
time
shrugged
bertram
below
william
rooms
was
the
floor
once
bertram
but
afterwards
given
over
to
the
use
of
billy
and
aunt
hannah
the
rooms
were
open
and
were
bright
with
sunshine
and
roses
but
they
were
very
plainly
unoccupied
and
you
do
use
them
yet
remonstrated
billy
as
she
paused
at
an
open
door
no
these
are
bertram
henshaw
rooms
said
the
youngest
henshaw
brother
in
a
voice
that
made
billy
hurry
away
with
a
dimpling
blush
they
were
billy
and
they
can
never
seem
any
one
but
billy
now
declared
william
to
marie
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
and
now
for
the
den
and
some
good
stories
before
the
fire
proposed
bertram
as
the
six
reached
the
first
floor
again
but
we
have
seen
your
pictures
yet
objected
billy
bertram
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
there
nothing
much
he
began
but
he
stopped
at
once
with
an
odd
laugh
well
i
say
he
finished
flinging
open
the
door
of
his
studio
and
pressing
a
button
that
flooded
the
room
with
light
the
next
moment
as
they
stood
before
those
plaques
and
panels
and
canvases
on
each
of
which
was
a
pictured
billy
they
understood
the
change
in
his
sentence
and
they
laughed
appreciatively
indeed
exclaimed
william
oh
how
lovely
breathed
marie
my
grief
and
conscience
bertram
all
these
and
of
billy
i
knew
you
had
a
good
many
but
aunt
hannah
paused
impotently
her
eyes
going
from
bertram
face
to
the
pictures
again
but
how
when
did
you
do
them
queried
marie
some
of
them
from
memory
more
of
them
from
life
a
lot
of
them
were
just
sketches
that
i
did
when
she
was
here
in
the
house
four
or
five
years
ago
answered
bertram
like
this
for
and
he
pulled
into
a
better
light
a
picture
of
a
laughing
girl
holding
against
her
cheek
a
small
gray
kitten
with
alert
bright
eyes
the
original
and
only
spunk
he
announced
what
a
dear
little
cat
cried
marie
you
should
have
seen
it
in
the
flesh
remarked
cyril
dryly
no
paint
nor
painter
could
imprison
that
untamed
bit
of
satanic
mischief
on
any
canvas
that
ever
grew
everybody
laughed
everybody
but
billy
billy
indeed
of
them
all
had
been
strangely
silent
ever
since
they
entered
the
studio
she
stood
now
a
little
apart
her
eyes
were
wide
and
a
bit
frightened
her
fingers
were
twisting
the
corners
of
her
handkerchief
nervously
she
was
looking
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
everywhere
she
saw
herself
sometimes
it
was
her
full
face
sometimes
her
profile
sometimes
there
were
only
her
eyes
peeping
from
above
a
fan
or
peering
from
out
brown
shadows
of
nothingness
once
it
was
merely
the
back
of
her
head
showing
the
mass
of
waving
hair
with
its
high
lights
of
burnished
bronze
again
it
was
still
the
back
of
her
head
with
below
it
the
bare
slender
neck
and
the
shoulders
in
this
picture
the
curve
of
a
cheek
showed
plainly
and
in
the
background
was
visible
a
hand
holding
four
playing
cards
at
which
the
pictured
girl
was
evidently
looking
sometimes
it
was
a
merry
billy
with
dancing
eyes
sometimes
a
demure
billy
with
long
lashes
caressing
a
flushed
cheek
sometimes
it
was
a
wistful
billy
with
eyes
that
looked
straight
into
yours
with
peculiar
appeal
but
always
it
was
billy
there
i
think
the
tilt
of
this
chin
is
it
was
bertram
speaking
billy
gave
a
sudden
cry
her
face
whitened
she
stumbled
forward
no
no
bertram
you
you
did
mean
the
the
tilt
of
the
chin
she
faltered
wildly
the
man
turned
in
amazement
why
billy
he
stammered
billy
what
is
it
the
girl
fell
back
at
once
she
tried
to
laugh
lightly
she
had
seen
the
dismayed
questioning
in
her
lover
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
william
and
the
others
she
gesticulated
hurriedly
it
was
nothing
at
all
but
billy
it
bertram
eyes
were
still
troubled
was
it
the
picture
i
thought
you
liked
this
billy
laughed
again
this
time
more
naturally
bertram
i
ashamed
of
you
expecting
me
to
say
i
any
of
this
she
scolded
with
a
wave
of
her
hands
toward
the
omnipresent
billy
why
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
room
with
a
thousand
mirrors
and
that
i
been
discovered
putting
rouge
on
my
cheeks
and
lampblack
on
my
eyebrows
william
laughed
fondly
aunt
hannah
and
marie
gave
an
indulgent
smile
cyril
actually
chuckled
bertram
only
still
wore
a
puzzled
expression
as
he
laid
aside
the
canvas
in
his
hands
billy
examined
intently
a
sketch
she
had
found
with
its
back
to
the
wall
it
was
not
a
pretty
sketch
it
was
not
even
a
finished
one
and
billy
did
not
in
the
least
care
what
it
was
but
her
lips
cried
interestedly
oh
bertram
what
is
this
there
was
no
answer
bertram
was
still
engaged
apparently
in
putting
away
some
sketches
over
by
the
doorway
leading
to
the
den
marie
and
aunt
hannah
followed
by
william
and
cyril
were
just
disappearing
behind
a
huge
easel
in
another
minute
the
merry
chatter
of
their
voices
came
from
the
room
beyond
bertram
hurried
then
straight
across
the
studio
to
the
girl
still
bending
over
the
sketch
in
the
corner
bertram
gasped
billy
as
a
kiss
brushed
her
cheek
pooh
they
gone
besides
what
if
they
did
see
billy
what
was
the
matter
with
the
tilt
of
that
chin
billy
gave
an
hysterical
little
laugh
at
least
bertram
tried
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
a
laugh
though
it
had
sounded
almost
like
a
sob
bertram
if
you
say
another
word
about
about
the
tilt
of
that
chin
i
shall
she
panted
why
billy
with
a
nervous
little
movement
billy
turned
and
began
to
reverse
the
canvases
nearest
her
come
sir
she
commanded
gayly
billy
has
been
on
exhibition
quite
long
enough
it
is
high
time
she
was
turned
face
to
the
wall
to
meditate
and
grow
more
bertram
did
not
answer
neither
did
he
make
a
move
to
assist
her
his
ardent
gray
eyes
were
following
her
slim
graceful
figure
admiringly
billy
it
does
seem
true
yet
that
you
really
mine
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
voice
shaken
with
emotion
billy
turned
abruptly
a
peculiar
radiance
shone
in
her
eyes
and
glorified
her
face
as
she
stood
she
was
close
to
a
picture
on
an
easel
and
full
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
shaded
lights
above
it
then
you
want
me
she
began
just
not
to
she
stopped
short
the
man
opposite
had
taken
an
eager
step
toward
her
on
his
face
was
the
look
she
knew
so
well
the
look
she
had
come
almost
to
dread
the
painting
billy
stand
just
as
you
are
he
was
saying
do
move
jove
but
that
effect
is
perfect
with
those
dark
shadows
beyond
and
just
your
hair
and
face
and
throat
showing
i
declare
i
half
a
mind
to
sketch
but
billy
with
a
little
cry
was
gone
chapter
x
a
job
for
pete
and
for
bertram
the
early
days
in
december
were
busy
ones
certainly
in
the
little
house
on
corey
hill
marie
was
to
be
married
the
twelfth
it
was
to
be
a
home
wedding
and
a
very
simple
one
according
to
billy
and
according
to
what
marie
had
said
it
was
to
be
billy
still
serenely
spoke
of
it
as
a
simple
affair
but
marie
was
beginning
to
be
fearful
as
the
days
passed
bringing
with
them
more
and
more
frequent
evidences
either
tangible
or
intangible
of
orders
to
stationers
caterers
and
florists
her
fears
found
voice
in
a
protest
but
billy
it
was
to
be
a
wedding
she
cried
and
so
it
but
what
is
this
i
hear
about
a
breakfast
billy
chin
assumed
its
most
stubborn
squareness
i
do
know
i
sure
what
you
did
hear
she
retorted
calmly
billy
billy
laughed
the
chin
was
just
as
stubborn
but
the
smiling
lips
above
it
graced
it
with
an
air
of
charming
concession
there
there
dear
coaxed
the
mistress
of
hillside
do
fret
besides
i
sure
i
should
think
you
of
all
people
would
want
your
guests
but
this
is
so
elaborate
from
what
i
nonsense
not
a
bit
of
rosa
says
there
be
salads
and
cakes
and
ices
and
i
do
know
what
billy
looked
concerned
well
of
course
marie
if
you
have
oatmeal
and
doughnuts
she
began
with
kind
solicitude
but
she
got
no
farther
billy
besought
the
bride
elect
wo
you
be
serious
and
the
cake
in
wedding
boxes
i
know
but
boxes
are
so
much
easier
and
cleaner
than
just
fingers
apologized
an
anxiously
serious
voice
marie
answered
with
an
indignant
grieved
glance
and
hurried
on
and
the
flowers
roses
dozens
of
them
in
december
billy
i
ca
let
you
do
all
this
for
nonsense
dear
laughed
billy
why
i
love
to
do
it
besides
when
you
gone
just
think
how
lonesome
i
be
i
shall
have
to
adopt
somebody
else
then
now
that
mary
jane
has
proved
to
be
nothing
but
a
disappointing
man
instead
of
a
nice
little
girl
like
you
she
finished
whimsically
marie
did
not
smile
the
frown
still
lay
between
her
delicate
brows
and
for
my
trousseau
there
were
so
many
things
that
you
simply
would
buy
i
did
get
one
of
the
billy
reminded
her
anxiously
marie
smiled
now
but
she
shook
her
head
too
billy
i
can
not
have
you
do
all
this
for
why
not
at
the
unexpectedly
direct
question
marie
fell
back
a
little
why
because
i
i
ca
she
stammered
i
ca
get
them
for
myself
and
and
do
you
love
me
a
pink
flush
stole
to
marie
face
indeed
i
do
do
i
love
you
the
flush
deepened
i
i
hope
then
why
wo
you
let
me
do
what
i
want
to
and
be
happy
in
it
money
just
money
is
any
good
unless
you
can
exchange
it
for
something
you
want
and
just
now
i
want
pink
roses
and
ice
cream
and
lace
flounces
for
you
marie
billy
voice
trembled
a
little
i
never
had
a
sister
till
i
had
you
and
i
have
had
such
a
good
time
buying
things
that
i
thought
you
wanted
but
of
course
if
you
do
want
them
the
words
ended
in
a
choking
sob
and
down
went
billy
head
into
her
folded
arms
on
the
desk
before
her
marie
sprang
to
her
feet
and
cuddled
the
bowed
head
in
a
loving
embrace
but
i
do
want
them
dear
i
want
them
all
every
single
one
she
urged
now
promise
me
promise
me
that
you
do
them
all
just
as
you
planned
you
will
wo
you
there
was
the
briefest
of
hesitations
then
came
the
muffled
reply
yes
if
you
really
want
i
do
dear
indeed
i
do
i
love
pretty
weddings
and
i
i
always
hoped
that
i
could
have
one
if
i
ever
married
so
you
must
know
dear
how
i
really
do
want
all
those
things
declared
marie
fervently
and
now
i
must
go
i
promised
to
meet
cyril
at
park
street
at
three
and
she
hurried
from
the
room
and
not
until
she
was
to
her
destination
did
it
suddenly
occur
to
her
that
she
had
been
urging
actually
urging
miss
billy
neilson
to
buy
for
her
pink
roses
ice
cream
and
lace
flounces
her
cheeks
burned
with
shame
then
but
almost
at
once
she
smiled
now
was
that
just
like
billy
she
was
saying
to
herself
with
a
tender
glow
in
her
eyes
it
was
early
in
december
that
pete
came
one
day
with
a
package
for
marie
from
cyril
marie
was
not
at
home
and
billy
herself
went
downstairs
to
take
the
package
from
the
old
man
hands
mr
cyril
said
to
give
it
to
miss
hawthorn
stammered
the
old
servant
his
face
lighting
up
as
billy
entered
the
room
but
i
sure
he
would
mind
taking
i
afraid
i
have
to
take
it
pete
unless
you
want
to
carry
it
back
with
you
she
smiled
i
see
that
miss
hawthorn
has
it
the
very
first
moment
she
comes
thank
you
miss
it
does
my
old
eyes
good
to
see
your
bright
he
hesitated
then
turned
slowly
good
day
miss
billy
laid
the
package
on
the
table
her
eyes
were
thoughtful
as
she
looked
after
the
old
man
who
was
now
almost
to
the
door
something
in
his
bowed
form
appealed
to
her
strangely
she
took
a
quick
step
toward
him
you
miss
cyril
pete
she
said
pleasantly
the
old
man
stopped
at
once
and
turned
he
lifted
his
head
a
little
proudly
yes
miss
i
i
was
there
when
he
was
born
cyril
a
fine
indeed
he
is
perhaps
it
your
good
care
that
helped
some
to
make
him
so
smiled
the
girl
vaguely
wishing
that
she
could
say
something
that
would
drive
the
wistful
look
from
the
dim
old
eyes
before
her
for
a
moment
billy
thought
she
had
succeeded
the
old
servant
drew
himself
stiffly
erect
in
his
eyes
shone
the
loyal
pride
of
more
than
fifty
years
honest
service
almost
at
once
however
the
pride
died
away
and
the
wistfulness
returned
thank
ye
miss
but
i
do
lay
no
claim
to
that
of
course
he
said
mr
cyril
a
fine
man
and
we
shall
miss
him
but
i
changes
must
come
to
all
of
billy
brown
eyes
grew
a
little
misty
i
suppose
they
must
she
admitted
the
old
man
hesitated
then
as
if
impelled
by
some
hidden
force
he
plunged
on
yes
and
they
be
comin
to
you
one
of
these
days
miss
and
what
i
was
wantin
to
speak
to
ye
about
i
understand
of
course
that
when
you
get
there
you
be
wantin
younger
blood
to
serve
ye
my
feet
ai
so
spry
as
they
once
was
and
my
old
hands
blunder
sometimes
in
spite
of
what
my
head
bids
do
so
i
wanted
to
tell
ye
that
of
course
i
should
expect
to
stay
i
as
he
said
the
words
pete
stood
with
head
and
shoulders
erect
his
eyes
looking
straight
forward
but
not
at
billy
do
you
to
stay
the
girlish
voice
was
a
little
reproachful
pete
head
drooped
not
if
i
not
wanted
came
the
husky
reply
with
an
impulsive
movement
billy
came
straight
to
the
old
man
side
and
held
out
her
hand
pete
amazement
incredulity
and
a
look
that
was
almost
terror
crossed
the
old
man
face
then
a
flood
of
dull
red
blotted
them
all
out
and
left
only
worshipful
rapture
with
a
choking
cry
he
took
the
slim
little
hand
in
both
his
rough
and
twisted
ones
much
as
if
he
were
possessing
himself
of
a
treasured
bit
of
eggshell
china
miss
billy
pete
there
are
a
pair
of
feet
in
boston
nor
a
pair
of
hands
either
that
i
rather
have
serve
me
than
yours
no
matter
if
they
stumble
and
blunder
all
day
i
shall
love
stumbles
and
blunders
if
you
make
them
now
run
home
and
do
ever
let
me
hear
another
syllable
about
your
leaving
they
were
not
the
words
billy
had
intended
to
say
she
had
meant
to
speak
of
his
long
faithful
service
and
of
how
much
they
appreciated
it
but
to
her
surprise
billy
found
her
own
eyes
wet
and
her
own
voice
trembling
and
the
words
that
she
would
have
said
she
found
fast
shut
in
her
throat
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
stammer
out
something
anything
that
would
help
to
keep
her
from
yielding
to
that
absurd
and
awful
desire
to
fall
on
the
old
servant
neck
and
cry
not
another
syllable
she
repeated
sternly
miss
billy
choked
pete
again
then
he
turned
and
fled
with
anything
but
his
usual
dignity
bertram
called
that
evening
when
billy
came
to
him
in
the
her
slender
self
was
almost
hidden
behind
the
swirls
of
damask
linen
in
her
arms
bertram
eyes
grew
mutinous
do
you
expect
me
to
hug
all
that
he
demanded
billy
flashed
him
a
mischievous
glance
of
course
not
you
do
to
hug
anything
you
for
answer
he
impetuously
swept
the
offending
linen
into
the
nearest
chair
and
drew
the
girl
into
his
arms
oh
and
see
how
you
crushed
poor
marie
she
cried
with
reproachful
eyes
bertram
sniffed
imperturbably
i
not
sure
but
i
like
to
crush
marie
he
alleged
bertram
i
ca
help
it
see
here
he
loosened
his
clasp
and
held
the
girl
off
at
arm
length
regarding
her
with
stormy
eyes
it
marie
marie
marie
always
if
i
telephone
in
the
morning
you
gone
shopping
with
marie
if
i
want
you
in
the
afternoon
for
something
you
at
the
dressmaker
with
marie
if
i
call
in
the
evening
i
here
interrupted
billy
with
decision
oh
yes
you
here
admitted
bertram
aggrievedly
and
so
are
dozens
of
napkins
miles
of
and
yards
upon
yards
of
lace
and
flummydiddles
you
call
they
all
belong
to
marie
and
they
fill
your
arms
and
your
thoughts
full
until
there
is
an
inch
of
room
for
me
billy
when
is
this
thing
going
to
end
billy
laughed
softly
her
eyes
danced
the
twelfth
that
is
there
be
a
pause
well
i
thankful
if
eh
broke
off
the
man
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
what
do
you
mean
by
pause
billy
cast
down
her
eyes
demurely
well
of
course
ends
the
twelfth
with
marie
wedding
but
i
sort
of
regarded
it
as
an
understudy
for
one
that
coming
next
october
you
billy
you
darling
breathed
a
supremely
happy
voice
in
a
ear
billy
was
not
at
arm
length
now
billy
smiled
but
she
drew
away
with
gentle
firmness
and
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
sewing
she
said
bertram
arms
did
not
loosen
his
eyes
had
grown
mutinous
again
that
is
she
amended
i
must
be
practising
my
part
of
the
understudy
you
you
darling
breathed
bertram
again
this
time
however
he
let
her
go
but
honestly
is
it
all
necessary
he
sighed
despairingly
as
she
seated
herself
and
gathered
the
into
her
lap
do
you
have
to
do
so
much
of
it
all
i
do
smiled
billy
unless
you
want
your
brother
to
run
the
risk
of
leading
his
bride
to
the
altar
and
finding
her
robed
in
a
kitchen
apron
with
an
in
her
hand
for
a
bertram
laughed
is
it
so
bad
as
that
no
of
course
not
quite
but
never
have
i
seen
a
bride
so
utterly
oblivious
to
clothes
as
marie
was
till
one
day
in
despair
i
told
her
that
cyril
never
could
bear
a
dowdy
as
if
cyril
in
the
old
days
ever
could
bear
any
sort
of
woman
scoffed
bertram
merrily
i
know
but
i
did
mention
that
part
smiled
billy
i
just
singled
out
the
dowdy
did
it
work
billy
made
a
gesture
of
despair
did
it
work
it
worked
too
well
marie
gave
me
one
horrified
look
then
at
once
and
immediately
she
became
possessed
with
the
idea
that
she
a
dowdy
woman
and
from
that
day
to
this
she
has
pursued
every
lurking
wrinkle
and
every
fold
awry
until
her
dressmaker
life
worth
the
living
and
i
beginning
to
think
mine
is
either
for
i
have
to
assure
her
at
least
four
times
every
day
now
that
she
is
a
dowdy
you
poor
dear
laughed
bertram
no
wonder
you
do
have
time
to
give
to
me
a
peculiar
expression
crossed
billy
face
oh
but
i
not
the
one
who
at
times
is
otherwise
engaged
sir
she
reminded
him
what
do
you
mean
there
was
yesterday
and
last
monday
and
last
week
wednesday
and
oh
but
you
me
off
then
argued
bertram
anxiously
and
you
said
that
i
did
wish
to
interfere
with
your
work
which
was
quite
true
interrupted
billy
in
her
turn
smoothly
by
the
way
billy
was
examining
her
stitches
very
closely
now
how
is
miss
portrait
coming
on
splendidly
that
is
it
until
she
began
to
put
off
the
sittings
for
her
pink
teas
and
folderols
she
going
to
washington
next
week
too
to
be
gone
nearly
a
fortnight
finished
bertram
gloomily
are
you
putting
more
work
than
usual
into
this
one
and
more
sittings
well
yes
laughed
bertram
a
little
shortly
you
see
she
changed
the
pose
twice
changed
it
yes
was
satisfied
fancied
she
wanted
it
but
ca
you
do
you
have
something
to
say
about
it
oh
yes
of
course
and
she
claims
she
yield
to
my
judgment
anyhow
but
what
the
use
she
been
a
spoiled
darling
all
her
life
and
in
the
habit
of
having
her
own
way
about
everything
naturally
under
those
circumstances
i
ca
expect
to
get
a
satisfactory
portrait
if
out
of
tune
with
the
pose
besides
i
will
own
so
far
her
suggestions
have
made
for
improvement
probably
because
she
been
happy
in
making
them
so
her
expression
has
been
billy
wet
her
lips
i
saw
her
the
other
night
she
said
lightly
if
the
lightness
was
a
little
artificial
bertram
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
she
is
certainly
very
bertram
got
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
little
room
his
eyes
were
alight
on
his
face
the
painting
look
was
king
it
going
to
mean
a
lot
to
me
this
picture
billy
in
the
first
place
i
just
at
the
point
in
my
career
where
a
big
success
would
mean
a
lot
and
where
a
big
failure
would
mean
more
and
this
portrait
is
bound
to
be
one
or
the
other
from
the
very
nature
of
the
it
billy
voice
was
a
little
faint
yes
first
because
of
who
the
sitter
is
and
secondly
because
of
what
she
is
she
is
of
course
the
most
famous
subject
i
had
and
half
the
artistic
world
knows
by
this
time
that
marguerite
winthrop
is
being
done
by
henshaw
you
can
see
what
it
be
if
i
but
you
wo
fail
bertram
the
artist
lifted
his
chin
and
threw
back
his
shoulders
no
of
course
not
but
he
hesitated
frowned
and
dropped
himself
into
a
chair
his
eyes
studied
the
fire
moodily
you
see
he
resumed
after
a
moment
there
a
peculiar
elusive
something
about
her
expression
billy
stirred
restlessly
and
gave
her
thread
so
savage
a
jerk
that
it
broke
a
something
that
is
easily
caught
by
the
brush
anderson
and
fullam
big
fellows
both
of
them
did
catch
it
at
least
i
understood
that
neither
her
family
nor
her
friends
are
satisfied
with
portraits
and
to
succeed
where
anderson
and
fullam
failed
jove
billy
a
chance
like
that
does
come
to
a
fellow
twice
in
a
lifetime
bertram
was
out
of
his
chair
again
tramping
up
and
down
the
little
room
billy
tossed
her
work
aside
and
sprang
to
her
feet
her
eyes
too
were
alight
now
but
you
are
going
to
fail
dear
she
cried
holding
out
both
her
hands
you
going
to
succeed
bertram
caught
the
hands
and
kissed
first
one
then
the
other
of
their
soft
little
palms
of
course
i
am
he
agreed
passionately
leading
her
to
the
sofa
and
seating
himself
at
her
side
yes
but
you
must
really
it
she
urged
feel
the
in
yourself
you
have
to
to
doing
things
that
what
i
told
mary
jane
yesterday
when
he
was
running
on
about
what
wanted
to
do
in
his
singing
you
bertram
stiffened
a
little
a
quick
frown
came
to
his
face
mary
jane
indeed
of
all
the
absurd
names
to
give
a
man
billy
do
for
pity
sake
call
him
by
his
name
if
got
billy
broke
into
a
rippling
laugh
i
wish
i
could
dear
she
sighed
ingenuously
honestly
it
bothers
me
because
i
think
of
him
as
anything
but
jane
it
seems
so
silly
it
certainly
does
when
one
remembers
his
oh
he
shaved
that
off
now
he
looks
rather
better
bertram
turned
a
little
sharply
do
you
see
the
fellow
often
billy
laughed
merrily
no
he
about
as
disgruntled
as
you
are
over
the
way
the
wedding
monopolizes
everything
he
been
up
once
or
twice
to
see
aunt
hannah
and
to
get
acquainted
as
he
expresses
it
and
once
he
brought
up
some
music
and
we
sang
but
he
declares
the
wedding
has
given
him
half
a
indeed
well
that
a
pity
i
sure
rejoined
bertram
icily
billy
turned
in
slight
surprise
why
bertram
do
you
like
mary
jane
billy
for
heaven
sake
he
got
any
name
but
that
billy
clapped
her
hands
together
suddenly
there
that
makes
me
think
he
told
aunt
hannah
and
me
to
guess
what
his
name
was
and
we
never
hit
it
once
what
do
you
think
it
is
the
initials
are
i
could
say
i
sure
what
is
it
oh
he
did
tell
us
you
see
he
left
us
to
guess
did
he
yes
mused
billy
abstractedly
her
eyes
on
the
dancing
fire
the
next
minute
she
stirred
and
settled
herself
more
comfortably
in
the
curve
of
her
lover
arm
but
there
who
cares
what
his
name
is
i
sure
i
nor
i
echoed
bertram
in
a
voice
that
he
tried
to
make
not
too
fervent
he
had
not
forgotten
billy
surprised
why
bertram
you
like
mary
jane
and
he
did
not
like
to
call
forth
a
repetition
of
it
abruptly
therefore
he
changed
the
subject
by
the
way
what
did
you
do
to
pete
he
asked
laughingly
he
came
home
in
a
seventh
heaven
of
happiness
babbling
of
what
an
angel
straight
from
the
sky
miss
billy
was
naturally
i
agreed
with
him
on
that
point
but
what
did
you
do
to
him
billy
smiled
nothing
only
engaged
him
for
our
butler
for
oh
i
see
that
was
dear
of
you
as
if
i
do
anything
else
and
now
for
dong
ling
i
suppose
some
bertram
chuckled
well
maybe
i
can
help
you
there
he
hinted
you
see
his
celestial
majesty
came
to
me
himself
the
other
day
and
said
after
sundry
and
various
preliminaries
that
he
should
be
much
glad
when
the
missee
came
to
live
with
me
for
then
he
could
go
back
to
china
with
a
heart
at
rest
as
he
had
money
much
plenty
and
wish
to
be
man
any
dear
me
smiled
billy
what
a
happy
state
of
affairs
for
him
but
for
you
do
you
realize
young
man
what
that
means
for
you
a
new
wife
and
a
new
cook
all
at
once
and
you
know
i
not
marie
ho
i
not
worrying
retorted
bertram
with
a
contented
smile
besides
as
perhaps
you
noticed
it
was
marie
that
i
asked
to
marry
me
chapter
xi
a
clock
and
aunt
hannah
kate
hartwell
the
henshaw
brothers
sister
from
the
west
was
expected
on
the
tenth
her
husband
could
not
come
she
had
written
but
she
would
bring
with
her
little
kate
the
youngest
child
the
boys
paul
and
egbert
would
stay
with
their
father
billy
received
the
news
of
little
kate
coming
with
outspoken
delight
the
very
thing
she
cried
we
have
her
for
a
flower
girl
she
was
a
dear
little
creature
as
i
remember
aunt
hannah
gave
a
sudden
low
laugh
yes
i
remember
she
observed
kate
told
me
after
you
spent
the
first
day
with
her
that
you
graciously
informed
her
that
little
kate
was
almost
as
nice
as
spunk
kate
did
not
fully
appreciate
the
compliment
i
billy
made
a
wry
face
did
i
say
that
dear
me
i
a
terror
in
those
days
was
i
but
then
and
she
laughed
softly
really
aunt
hannah
that
was
the
prettiest
thing
i
knew
how
to
say
for
i
considered
spunk
the
of
i
think
i
should
have
liked
to
know
spunk
smiled
marie
from
the
other
side
of
the
sewing
table
he
was
a
dear
declared
billy
i
had
another
as
good
when
i
first
came
to
hillside
but
he
got
lost
for
a
time
it
seemed
as
if
i
never
wanted
another
but
i
about
come
to
the
conclusion
now
that
i
do
and
i
told
bertram
to
find
one
for
me
if
he
can
you
see
i
shall
be
lonesome
after
you
gone
marie
and
i
have
to
have
she
finished
mischievously
oh
i
do
mind
the
inference
as
long
as
i
know
your
admiration
of
cats
laughed
marie
let
me
see
kate
writes
she
is
coming
the
tenth
murmured
aunt
hannah
going
back
to
the
letter
in
her
hand
good
nodded
billy
that
will
give
time
to
put
little
kate
through
her
paces
as
flower
yes
and
it
will
give
big
kate
time
to
to
make
your
breakfast
a
supper
and
your
roses
pinks
or
sunflowers
cut
in
a
new
voice
dryly
cyril
chorussed
the
three
ladies
in
horror
adoration
and
amusement
according
to
whether
the
voice
belonged
to
aunt
hannah
marie
or
billy
cyril
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
but
rosa
said
you
were
in
here
sewing
and
i
told
her
not
to
bother
i
announce
myself
just
as
i
got
to
the
door
i
chanced
to
hear
billy
speech
and
i
resist
making
the
amendment
maybe
you
forgotten
kate
love
of
managing
but
i
have
he
finished
as
he
sauntered
over
to
the
chair
nearest
marie
no
i
have
forgotten
observed
billy
meaningly
nor
i
nor
anybody
else
declared
a
severe
voice
both
the
words
and
the
severity
being
most
extraordinary
as
coming
from
the
usually
gentle
aunt
hannah
oh
well
never
mind
spoke
up
billy
quickly
everything
all
right
now
so
let
forget
it
she
always
meant
it
for
kindness
i
even
when
she
told
you
in
the
first
place
what
a
er
torment
you
were
to
us
quizzed
cyril
yes
flashed
billy
she
was
being
kind
to
humph
vouchsafed
cyril
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
cyril
eyes
were
on
marie
who
was
nervously
trying
to
smooth
back
a
few
fluffy
wisps
of
hair
that
had
escaped
from
restraining
combs
and
pins
what
the
matter
with
the
hair
little
girl
asked
cyril
in
a
voice
that
was
caressingly
irritable
you
been
fussing
with
that
curl
for
the
last
five
minutes
marie
delicate
face
flushed
painfully
it
got
loose
my
hair
she
stammered
and
it
looks
so
dowdy
that
way
billy
dropped
her
thread
suddenly
she
sprang
for
it
at
once
before
cyril
could
make
a
move
to
get
it
she
had
to
dive
far
under
a
chair
to
capture
it
which
may
explain
why
her
face
was
so
very
red
when
she
finally
reached
her
seat
again
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
billy
marie
and
aunt
hannah
were
once
more
sewing
together
this
time
in
the
little
at
the
end
of
the
hall
billy
fingers
in
particular
were
flying
very
fast
i
told
john
to
have
peggy
at
the
door
at
eleven
she
said
after
a
time
but
i
think
i
can
finish
running
in
this
ribbon
before
then
i
have
much
to
do
to
get
ready
to
i
hope
kate
train
wo
be
late
worried
aunt
hannah
i
hope
not
replied
billy
but
i
told
rosa
to
delay
luncheon
anyway
till
we
get
here
i
she
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
a
listening
ear
toward
the
door
of
aunt
hannah
room
which
was
open
a
clock
was
striking
mercy
that
ca
be
eleven
now
she
cried
but
it
must
be
it
was
ten
before
i
came
she
got
to
her
feet
hurriedly
aunt
hannah
put
out
a
restraining
hand
no
no
dear
that
but
it
struck
yes
i
know
it
does
at
why
the
little
wretch
laughed
billy
dropping
back
into
her
chair
and
picking
up
her
work
again
the
idea
of
its
telling
fibs
like
that
and
frightening
people
half
out
of
their
lives
i
have
it
fixed
right
away
maybe
john
can
do
it
he
always
so
handy
about
such
but
i
do
want
it
fixed
demurred
aunt
hannah
billy
stared
a
little
you
do
want
it
fixed
maybe
you
like
to
have
it
strike
eleven
when
it
ten
billy
voice
was
merrily
sarcastic
i
do
stammered
the
lady
apologetically
you
see
i
i
worked
very
hard
to
fix
it
so
it
would
strike
that
hannah
well
i
did
retorted
the
lady
with
unexpected
spirit
i
wanted
to
know
what
time
it
was
in
the
night
i
awake
such
a
but
i
do
billy
eyes
were
perplexed
why
must
you
make
it
tell
fibs
in
order
to
to
find
out
the
truth
she
laughed
aunt
hannah
elevated
her
chin
a
little
because
that
clock
was
always
striking
one
yes
you
know
and
i
never
knew
which
it
but
it
must
strike
now
just
the
same
it
there
was
the
triumphant
ring
of
the
conqueror
in
aunt
hannah
voice
but
now
it
strikes
the
and
the
clock
in
the
hall
tells
me
what
time
it
is
so
i
do
for
one
more
brief
minute
billy
stared
before
a
sudden
light
of
understanding
illumined
her
face
then
her
laugh
rang
out
gleefully
oh
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
she
gurgled
if
bertram
call
you
the
limit
making
a
clock
strike
eleven
so
you
know
ten
aunt
hannah
colored
a
little
but
she
stood
her
ground
well
there
only
half
an
hour
anyway
now
that
i
do
know
what
time
it
is
she
maintained
for
one
or
the
other
of
those
clocks
strikes
the
hour
every
thirty
minutes
even
during
those
three
ones
that
strike
one
after
the
other
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
can
tell
now
for
the
hall
clock
has
a
different
sound
for
the
you
know
so
i
can
tell
whether
it
one
or
a
of
course
chuckled
billy
i
sure
i
think
it
a
splendid
idea
chimed
in
marie
valiantly
and
i
going
to
write
it
to
mother
cousin
jane
right
away
she
an
invalid
and
she
always
lying
awake
nights
wondering
what
time
it
is
the
doctor
says
actually
he
believes
she
get
well
if
he
could
find
some
way
of
letting
her
know
the
time
at
night
so
she
get
some
sleep
for
she
simply
ca
go
to
sleep
till
she
knows
she
ca
bear
a
light
in
the
room
and
it
wakes
her
all
up
to
turn
an
electric
switch
or
anything
of
that
why
does
she
have
one
of
those
phosphorous
things
questioned
billy
marie
laughed
quietly
she
did
i
sent
her
one
and
she
stood
it
just
one
stood
it
yes
she
declared
it
gave
her
the
creeps
and
that
she
would
have
the
spooky
thing
staring
at
her
all
night
like
that
so
it
got
to
be
something
she
can
hear
and
i
going
to
tell
her
stetson
plan
right
well
i
sure
i
wish
you
would
cried
that
lady
with
prompt
interest
and
she
like
it
i
sure
and
tell
her
if
she
can
hear
a
clock
strike
it
just
the
same
and
even
better
for
there
are
any
at
all
to
think
of
i
will
and
i
think
it
lovely
declared
marie
of
course
it
lovely
smiled
billy
rising
but
i
fancy
i
better
go
and
get
ready
to
meet
hartwell
or
the
thing
will
be
telling
me
that
it
eleven
and
she
tripped
laughingly
from
the
room
promptly
at
the
appointed
time
john
with
peggy
drew
up
before
the
door
and
billy
muffled
in
furs
stepped
into
the
car
which
with
its
protecting
top
and
sides
and
glass
was
in
its
winter
dress
yes
is
a
little
chilly
miss
said
john
in
answer
to
her
greeting
as
he
tucked
the
heavy
robes
about
her
oh
well
i
shall
be
very
comfortable
i
sure
smiled
billy
just
do
drive
too
rapidly
specially
coming
home
i
shall
have
to
get
a
limousine
i
think
when
my
ship
comes
in
john
grizzled
old
face
twitched
so
evident
were
the
words
that
were
not
spoken
that
billy
asked
laughingly
well
john
what
is
it
john
reddened
furiously
nothing
miss
i
was
only
thinkin
that
if
you
did
ter
in
so
many
other
folks
ships
yours
might
get
in
why
john
nonsense
i
i
love
to
haul
in
other
folks
ships
laughed
the
girl
embarrassedly
yes
miss
i
know
you
do
grunted
john
billy
colored
no
no
that
is
i
mean
i
do
do
it
very
much
she
stammered
john
did
not
answer
apparently
but
billy
was
sure
she
caught
a
indignant
much
as
he
snapped
the
door
shut
and
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
to
herself
she
laughed
softly
she
thought
she
possessed
the
secret
now
of
some
of
john
disapproving
glances
toward
her
humble
guests
of
the
summer
before
chapter
xii
sister
kate
at
the
station
hartwell
train
was
found
to
be
gratifyingly
on
time
and
in
due
course
billy
was
extending
a
cordial
welcome
to
a
tall
handsome
woman
who
carried
herself
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
assured
competence
accompanying
her
was
a
little
girl
with
big
blue
eyes
and
yellow
curls
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
both
smiled
billy
holding
out
a
friendly
hand
to
hartwell
and
stooping
to
kiss
the
round
cheek
of
the
little
girl
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
murmured
the
lady
but
are
you
alone
billy
where
are
the
boys
uncle
william
is
out
of
town
and
cyril
is
rushed
to
death
and
sent
his
excuses
bertram
did
mean
to
come
but
he
telephoned
this
morning
that
he
could
after
all
i
sorry
but
i
afraid
you
have
to
make
the
best
of
just
me
condoled
billy
they
be
out
to
the
house
this
evening
of
course
all
but
uncle
william
he
does
return
until
oh
does
he
murmured
the
lady
reaching
for
her
daughter
hand
billy
looked
down
with
a
smile
and
this
is
little
kate
i
suppose
she
said
whom
i
have
seen
for
such
a
long
long
time
let
me
see
you
are
how
old
now
i
eight
i
been
eight
six
billy
eyes
twinkled
and
you
do
remember
me
i
the
little
girl
shook
her
head
no
but
i
know
who
you
are
she
added
with
shy
eagerness
going
to
be
my
aunt
billy
and
you
going
to
marry
my
uncle
william
i
mean
my
uncle
billy
face
changed
color
hartwell
gave
a
despairing
gesture
kate
my
dear
i
told
you
to
be
sure
and
remember
that
it
was
your
uncle
bertram
now
you
see
she
added
in
a
discouraged
aside
to
billy
she
ca
seem
to
forget
the
first
one
but
then
what
can
you
expect
laughed
hartwell
a
little
disagreeably
such
abrupt
changes
from
one
brother
to
another
are
somewhat
disconcerting
you
billy
bit
her
lip
for
a
moment
she
said
nothing
then
a
little
constrainedly
she
rejoined
perhaps
still
let
us
hope
we
have
the
right
one
hartwell
raised
her
eyebrows
well
my
dear
i
not
so
confident
of
that
choice
has
been
and
always
will
be
billy
bit
her
lip
again
this
time
her
brown
eyes
flashed
a
little
is
that
so
but
you
see
after
all
are
making
the
the
billy
spoke
lightly
gayly
and
she
ended
with
a
bright
little
laugh
as
if
to
hide
any
intended
impertinence
it
was
hartwell
turn
to
bite
her
lip
and
she
did
it
so
it
seems
she
rejoined
frigidly
after
the
briefest
of
pauses
it
was
not
until
they
were
on
their
way
to
corey
hill
some
time
later
that
hartwell
turned
with
the
question
cyril
is
to
be
married
in
church
i
suppose
no
they
both
preferred
a
home
oh
what
a
pity
church
weddings
are
so
attractive
to
those
who
like
them
amended
billy
in
spite
of
herself
to
every
one
i
think
corrected
hartwell
positively
billy
laughed
she
was
beginning
to
discern
that
it
did
not
do
much
harm
nor
much
good
to
disagree
with
her
guest
it
in
the
evening
then
of
course
pursued
hartwell
no
at
oh
how
could
you
let
them
but
they
preferred
it
what
if
they
did
retorted
the
lady
sharply
ca
you
do
as
you
please
in
your
own
home
evening
weddings
are
so
much
prettier
we
change
now
of
course
with
the
guests
all
invited
that
is
i
suppose
you
do
have
guests
hartwell
voice
was
aggrievedly
despairing
oh
yes
smiled
billy
demurely
we
have
guests
invited
and
afraid
we
ca
change
the
no
of
course
not
but
it
too
bad
i
conclude
there
are
announcements
only
as
i
got
no
cards
announcements
only
bowed
billy
i
wish
cyril
had
consulted
a
little
about
this
billy
did
not
answer
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
just
then
cyril
words
of
two
days
before
were
in
her
ears
yes
and
it
will
give
big
kate
time
to
try
to
make
your
breakfast
supper
and
your
roses
pinks
or
in
a
moment
hartwell
spoke
again
of
course
a
noon
wedding
is
quite
pretty
if
you
darken
the
rooms
and
have
lights
you
going
to
do
that
i
suppose
billy
shook
her
head
slowly
i
afraid
not
hartwell
that
is
the
plan
not
darken
the
rooms
exclaimed
hartwell
why
it
wo
she
stopped
suddenly
and
fell
back
in
her
seat
the
look
of
annoyed
disappointment
gave
way
to
one
of
confident
relief
but
then
be
changed
she
finished
serenely
billy
opened
her
lips
but
she
shut
them
without
speaking
after
a
minute
she
opened
them
again
you
might
consult
cyril
about
that
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
yes
i
will
nodded
hartwell
brightly
she
was
looking
pleased
and
happy
again
i
love
weddings
do
you
you
can
so
much
with
them
can
you
laughed
billy
irrepressibly
yes
cyril
is
happy
of
course
still
i
ca
imagine
in
love
with
any
i
think
marie
i
suppose
so
i
do
seem
to
remember
her
much
still
i
think
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
when
i
was
on
last
june
music
teacher
was
she
yes
she
is
a
very
sweet
i
suppose
so
still
i
think
have
been
better
if
cyril
could
have
selected
some
one
that
musical
say
a
more
domestic
wife
he
so
terribly
unpractical
himself
about
household
billy
gave
a
ringing
laugh
and
stood
up
the
car
had
come
to
a
stop
before
her
own
door
do
you
just
you
wait
till
you
see
marie
trousseau
of
and
cake
tins
she
chuckled
hartwell
looked
blank
whatever
in
the
world
do
you
mean
billy
she
demanded
fretfully
as
she
followed
her
hostess
from
the
car
i
declare
are
you
ever
going
to
grow
beyond
making
those
absurd
remarks
of
yours
maybe
sometime
laughed
billy
as
she
took
little
kate
hand
and
led
the
way
up
the
steps
luncheon
in
the
cozy
at
hillside
that
day
was
not
entirely
a
success
at
least
there
were
not
present
exactly
the
harmony
and
tranquillity
that
are
conceded
to
be
the
best
sauce
for
one
food
the
wedding
of
course
was
the
topic
of
conversation
and
billy
between
aunt
hannah
attempts
to
be
polite
marie
to
be
hartwell
to
be
dictatorial
and
her
own
to
be
pacifying
as
well
as
firm
had
a
hard
time
of
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
two
or
three
diversions
created
by
little
kate
the
meal
would
have
been
indeed
a
dismal
failure
but
little
kate
most
of
the
time
the
personification
of
proper
had
a
disconcerting
faculty
of
occasionally
dropping
a
word
here
or
a
question
there
with
startling
effect
as
for
instance
when
she
asked
billy
who
going
to
boss
your
wedding
and
again
when
she
calmly
informed
her
mother
that
when
was
married
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
wedding
at
all
to
bother
with
anyhow
she
was
going
to
elope
and
she
should
choose
somebody
chauffeur
because
he
know
how
to
go
the
farthest
and
fastest
so
her
mother
could
catch
up
with
her
and
tell
her
how
she
ought
to
have
done
it
after
luncheon
aunt
hannah
went
for
rest
and
recuperation
marie
took
little
kate
and
went
for
a
brisk
walk
for
the
same
purpose
this
left
billy
alone
with
her
guest
perhaps
you
would
like
a
nap
too
hartwell
suggested
billy
as
they
passed
into
the
there
was
a
curious
note
of
almost
hopefulness
in
her
voice
hartwell
scorned
naps
and
she
said
so
very
emphatically
she
said
something
else
too
billy
why
do
you
always
call
me
hartwell
in
that
stiff
formal
fashion
you
used
to
call
me
kate
but
i
was
very
young
billy
voice
was
troubled
billy
had
been
trying
so
hard
for
the
last
two
hours
to
be
the
graciously
cordial
hostess
to
this
woman
bertram
sister
very
true
then
why
not
now
billy
hesitated
she
was
wondering
why
it
seemed
so
hard
to
call
hartwell
of
course
resumed
the
lady
when
you
bertram
wife
and
my
sister
why
of
course
cried
billy
in
a
sudden
flood
of
understanding
curiously
enough
she
had
never
before
thought
of
hartwell
as
sister
i
shall
be
glad
to
call
you
if
you
thank
you
i
shall
like
it
very
much
billy
nodded
the
other
cordially
indeed
my
dear
i
very
fond
of
you
and
i
was
delighted
to
hear
you
were
to
be
my
sister
if
only
it
could
have
stayed
william
instead
of
but
it
could
smiled
billy
it
was
william
that
i
but
it
so
absurd
the
smile
was
gone
now
yes
forgive
me
billy
but
i
was
about
as
much
surprised
to
hear
of
bertram
engagement
as
i
was
of
billy
grew
a
little
white
but
bertram
was
never
an
avowed
like
cyril
was
he
dear
me
no
he
was
a
always
as
if
his
eternal
of
a
girl
did
prove
that
bertram
has
always
loved
women
to
paint
but
as
for
his
ever
taking
them
seriously
why
billy
what
the
matter
billy
had
risen
suddenly
if
you
excuse
me
please
just
a
few
minutes
billy
said
very
quietly
i
want
to
speak
to
rosa
in
the
kitchen
i
be
back
in
the
kitchen
billy
spoke
to
rosa
she
wondered
afterwards
what
she
said
certainly
she
did
not
stay
in
the
kitchen
long
enough
to
say
much
in
her
own
room
a
minute
later
with
the
door
fast
closed
she
took
from
her
table
the
photograph
of
bertram
and
held
it
in
her
two
hands
talking
to
it
softly
but
a
little
wildly
i
did
listen
i
did
stay
do
you
hear
i
came
to
you
she
shall
not
say
anything
that
will
make
trouble
between
you
and
me
suffered
enough
through
her
already
and
she
does
she
know
before
and
she
does
now
she
only
imagining
i
will
not
not
believe
that
you
love
me
just
to
paint
no
matter
what
they
say
all
of
them
i
not
billy
put
the
photograph
back
on
the
table
then
and
went
to
her
guest
she
smiled
brightly
though
her
face
was
a
little
pale
i
wondered
if
perhaps
you
would
like
some
music
she
said
pleasantly
going
straight
to
the
piano
indeed
i
would
agreed
hartwell
billy
sat
down
then
and
played
played
as
hartwell
had
never
heard
her
play
before
why
billy
you
amaze
me
she
cried
when
the
pianist
stopped
and
whirled
about
i
had
no
idea
you
could
play
like
that
billy
smiled
enigmatically
billy
was
thinking
that
hartwell
would
indeed
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
known
that
in
that
playing
were
herself
the
ride
home
the
luncheon
bertram
and
the
girl
whom
bertram
not
love
only
to
paint
chapter
xiii
cyril
and
a
wedding
the
twelfth
was
a
beautiful
day
clear
frosty
air
set
the
blood
to
tingling
and
the
eyes
to
sparkling
even
if
it
were
not
your
wedding
day
while
if
it
were
it
marie
hawthorn
wedding
day
and
certainly
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
blood
tingled
as
she
threw
open
the
window
of
her
room
and
breathed
long
and
deep
of
the
fresh
morning
air
before
going
down
to
breakfast
they
say
is
the
bride
that
the
sun
shines
on
she
whispered
softly
to
an
english
sparrow
that
cocked
his
eye
at
her
from
a
neighboring
tree
branch
as
if
a
bride
would
be
happy
sun
or
no
sun
she
scoffed
tenderly
as
she
turned
to
go
as
it
happens
however
tingling
blood
and
sparkling
eyes
are
a
matter
of
more
than
weather
or
even
weddings
as
was
proved
a
little
later
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
kate
answered
the
ring
hullo
is
that
you
kate
called
a
despairing
voice
yes
good
morning
bertram
is
this
a
fine
day
for
the
wedding
fine
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
though
i
must
confess
i
have
noticed
it
and
you
would
if
you
had
a
lunatic
on
your
a
lunatic
yes
maybe
you
have
though
is
marie
rampaging
around
the
house
like
a
wild
creature
and
asking
ten
questions
and
making
twenty
threats
to
the
minute
certainly
not
do
be
absurd
bertram
what
do
you
mean
see
here
kate
that
show
comes
off
at
twelve
sharp
does
it
show
indeed
retorted
kate
indignantly
the
is
at
noon
sharp
as
the
best
man
should
know
very
all
right
then
tell
billy
please
to
see
that
it
is
sharp
or
i
answer
for
the
what
do
you
mean
what
is
the
matter
cyril
he
broken
loose
at
last
i
been
expecting
it
all
along
i
simply
marvelled
at
the
meekness
with
which
he
has
submitted
himself
to
be
tied
up
with
white
ribbons
and
topped
with
nonsense
bertram
well
it
amounts
to
that
anyhow
he
thinks
it
does
and
he
wild
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
the
thunderous
performance
on
his
piano
with
which
he
woke
me
up
this
morning
billy
says
he
plays
everything
his
past
present
and
future
all
is
if
he
was
playing
his
future
this
morning
i
pity
the
girl
who
got
to
live
it
with
bertram
bertram
chuckled
remorselessly
well
i
do
but
i
warrant
he
was
playing
his
future
this
morning
he
was
playing
his
present
the
wedding
you
see
he
just
waked
up
to
the
fact
that
it
be
a
perfect
orgy
of
women
and
other
confusion
and
he
does
like
it
all
the
samee
sic
i
had
to
assure
him
just
fourteen
times
this
morning
that
the
ring
the
license
the
carriage
the
minister
fee
and
my
sanity
are
all
when
he
is
asking
questions
he
making
threats
to
snake
the
parson
up
there
an
hour
ahead
of
time
and
be
off
with
marie
before
a
soul
what
an
absurd
idea
cyril
does
think
so
indeed
kate
i
had
a
hard
struggle
to
convince
him
that
the
guests
would
think
it
the
most
delightful
experience
of
their
lives
if
they
should
come
and
find
the
ceremony
over
with
and
the
bride
well
you
remind
cyril
please
that
there
are
other
people
besides
himself
concerned
in
this
wedding
observed
kate
icily
i
have
purred
bertram
and
he
says
all
right
let
them
have
it
then
he
gone
now
to
look
up
proxy
marriages
i
proxy
marriages
indeed
come
come
bertram
i
got
something
to
do
this
morning
besides
to
stand
here
listening
to
your
nonsense
see
that
you
and
cyril
get
here
on
time
that
all
and
she
hung
up
the
receiver
with
an
impatient
jerk
she
turned
to
confront
the
startled
eyes
of
the
bride
elect
what
is
it
is
anything
wrong
with
cyril
faltered
marie
kate
laughed
and
raised
her
eyebrows
slightly
nothing
but
a
little
stage
fright
my
stage
fright
yes
bertram
says
he
trying
to
find
some
one
to
play
his
rôle
i
believe
in
the
hartwell
at
the
look
of
dismayed
terror
that
came
into
marie
face
hartwell
laughed
reassuringly
there
there
dear
child
do
look
so
there
probably
never
was
a
man
yet
who
would
have
fled
from
the
wedding
part
of
his
marriage
if
he
could
and
you
know
how
cyril
hates
fuss
and
feathers
the
wonder
to
me
is
that
he
stood
it
as
long
as
he
has
i
thought
i
saw
it
coming
last
night
at
the
rehearsal
and
now
i
know
i
marie
still
looked
distressed
but
he
never
said
i
thought
she
stopped
helplessly
of
course
he
did
child
he
never
said
anything
but
that
he
loved
you
and
he
never
thought
anything
but
that
you
were
going
to
be
his
men
never
do
till
the
wedding
day
then
they
never
think
of
anything
but
a
place
to
run
she
finished
laughingly
as
she
began
to
arrange
on
a
stand
the
quantity
of
little
white
boxes
waiting
for
her
but
if
he
told
me
in
time
i
would
have
had
a
thing
but
the
minister
faltered
marie
and
when
you
think
so
much
of
a
pretty
wedding
too
nonsense
it
good
for
a
man
to
give
up
to
his
whims
like
that
marie
cheeks
grew
a
deeper
pink
her
nostrils
dilated
a
little
it
would
be
a
hartwell
and
i
should
be
to
give
up
she
said
with
decision
hartwell
laughed
again
her
amused
eyes
on
marie
face
dear
me
child
do
you
know
that
if
men
had
their
way
they
well
if
men
married
men
there
never
be
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
a
shower
bouquet
or
a
piece
of
wedding
cake
there
was
no
reply
a
little
precipitately
marie
turned
and
hurried
away
a
moment
later
she
was
laying
a
restraining
hand
on
billy
who
was
filling
tall
vases
with
superb
roses
in
the
kitchen
billy
please
she
panted
could
we
do
without
those
could
we
send
them
to
some
some
hospital
and
the
wedding
cake
too
and
the
wedding
cake
to
some
no
of
course
not
to
the
hospital
it
would
make
them
sick
to
eat
it
would
it
that
there
was
no
shadow
of
a
smile
on
marie
face
showed
how
desperate
indeed
was
her
state
of
mind
i
only
meant
that
i
did
want
them
myself
nor
the
shower
bouquet
nor
the
rooms
darkened
nor
little
kate
as
the
flower
girl
and
would
you
mind
very
much
if
i
asked
you
not
to
be
my
maid
of
honor
marie
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
and
began
to
sob
brokenly
so
there
was
nothing
for
billy
to
do
but
to
take
her
into
her
arms
with
soothing
little
murmurs
and
pettings
by
degrees
then
the
whole
story
came
out
billy
almost
laughed
but
she
almost
cried
too
then
she
said
dearie
i
do
believe
cyril
feels
or
acts
half
so
bad
as
bertram
and
kate
make
out
and
anyhow
if
he
did
it
too
late
now
to
to
send
the
wedding
cake
to
the
hospital
or
make
any
other
of
the
little
changes
you
billy
lips
puckered
into
a
but
her
eyes
were
grave
besides
there
are
your
music
pupils
trimming
the
this
minute
with
evergreen
there
little
kate
making
her
wreath
and
hartwell
stacking
cake
boxes
in
the
hall
to
say
nothing
of
rosa
gloating
over
the
best
china
in
the
and
aunt
hannah
putting
purple
bows
into
the
new
lace
cap
she
counting
on
wearing
only
think
how
disappointed
they
all
be
if
i
should
say
mind
stop
that
marie
just
going
to
have
a
minister
no
fuss
no
feathers
why
dearie
even
the
roses
are
hanging
their
heads
for
grief
she
went
on
mistily
lifting
with
gentle
fingers
one
of
the
pink
beauties
near
her
besides
there
your
oh
of
course
i
knew
i
could
really
sighed
marie
as
she
turned
to
go
all
the
light
and
joy
gone
from
her
face
billy
once
assured
that
marie
was
out
of
hearing
ran
to
the
telephone
bertram
answered
bertram
tell
cyril
i
want
to
speak
to
him
all
right
dear
but
go
easy
better
strike
up
your
tuning
fork
to
find
his
pitch
you
discover
it
a
high
one
all
a
moment
later
cyril
tersely
nervous
good
morning
billy
came
across
the
line
billy
drew
in
her
breath
and
cast
a
hurriedly
apprehensive
glance
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
marie
was
not
near
cyril
she
called
in
a
low
voice
if
you
care
a
shred
for
marie
for
heaven
sake
call
her
up
and
tell
her
that
you
dote
on
pink
roses
and
pink
ribbons
and
pink
breakfasts
and
pink
wedding
cake
but
i
oh
yes
you
do
you
would
if
you
could
see
marie
what
do
you
mean
nothing
only
she
overheard
part
of
bertram
nonsensical
talk
with
kate
a
little
while
ago
and
she
ready
to
cast
the
last
ravelling
of
white
satin
and
conventionality
behind
her
and
go
with
you
to
the
justice
of
the
sensible
girl
yes
but
she
ca
you
know
with
fifty
guests
coming
to
the
wedding
and
twice
as
many
more
to
the
reception
honestly
cyril
you
must
do
something
she
coming
and
the
receiver
clicked
sharply
into
place
five
minutes
later
marie
was
called
to
the
telephone
dejectedly
she
went
just
what
were
the
words
that
hummed
across
the
wire
into
the
pink
little
ear
of
the
billy
never
knew
but
a
marie
that
was
anything
but
and
dejected
left
the
telephone
a
little
later
and
was
heard
very
soon
in
the
room
above
trilling
merry
snatches
of
a
little
song
contentedly
then
billy
went
back
to
her
roses
it
was
a
pretty
wedding
a
very
pretty
wedding
every
one
said
that
the
pink
and
green
of
the
decorations
the
soft
lights
kate
had
had
her
way
about
darkening
the
rooms
the
pretty
frocks
and
smiling
faces
of
the
guests
all
helped
then
there
were
the
dainty
flower
girl
little
kate
the
charming
maid
of
honor
billy
the
stalwart
handsome
best
man
bertram
to
say
nothing
of
the
delicately
beautiful
bride
who
looked
like
some
fairy
visitor
from
another
world
in
the
floating
shimmer
of
her
gossamer
silk
and
tulle
there
was
too
not
quite
unnoticed
the
bridegroom
tall
of
distinguished
bearing
and
with
features
that
were
clear
cut
pale
then
came
the
reception
the
women
and
confusion
of
fears
followed
by
the
going
away
of
the
bride
and
groom
with
its
merry
warfare
of
confetti
and
old
shoes
at
four
however
with
only
william
and
bertram
remaining
for
guests
something
like
quiet
descended
at
last
on
the
little
house
well
it
over
sighed
billy
dropping
exhaustedly
into
a
big
chair
in
the
and
over
supplemented
aunt
hannah
covering
her
white
shawl
with
a
warmer
blue
one
yes
i
think
it
was
nodded
kate
it
was
really
a
very
pretty
with
your
help
kate
eh
teased
william
well
i
flatter
myself
i
did
do
some
good
bridled
kate
as
she
turned
to
help
little
kate
take
the
flower
wreath
from
her
head
even
if
you
did
hurry
into
my
room
and
scare
me
into
conniption
fits
telling
me
i
be
late
laughed
billy
kate
tossed
her
head
well
how
was
i
to
know
that
aunt
hannah
clock
only
meant
eleven
when
it
struck
twelve
she
retorted
everybody
laughed
oh
well
it
was
a
pretty
wedding
declared
william
with
a
long
sigh
it
do
for
an
understudy
said
bertram
softly
for
billy
ears
alone
only
the
added
color
and
the
swift
glance
showed
that
billy
heard
for
when
she
spoke
she
said
and
did
cyril
behave
beautifully
every
time
i
looked
at
him
he
was
talking
to
some
oh
no
he
was
begging
your
pardon
my
dear
objected
bertram
i
watched
him
too
even
more
closely
than
you
did
and
it
was
always
the
who
was
talking
to
billy
laughed
well
anyhow
she
maintained
he
listened
he
did
run
as
if
a
bridegroom
could
cried
kate
i
going
to
avowed
bertram
his
nose
in
the
air
pooh
scoffed
kate
then
she
added
eagerly
you
must
be
married
in
church
billy
and
in
the
bertram
nose
came
suddenly
out
of
the
air
his
eyes
met
squarely
billy
has
decided
yet
how
does
want
to
be
married
he
said
with
unnecessary
emphasis
billy
laughed
and
interposed
a
quick
change
of
subject
i
think
people
had
a
pretty
good
time
too
for
a
wedding
do
you
she
asked
i
was
sorry
mary
jane
could
be
here
have
been
such
a
good
chance
for
him
to
meet
our
as
jane
asked
bertram
a
little
stiffly
really
my
dear
murmured
aunt
hannah
i
think
it
be
more
respectful
to
call
him
by
his
by
the
way
what
is
his
name
questioned
william
that
what
we
do
know
laughed
billy
well
you
know
the
do
you
put
in
bertram
bertram
too
laughed
but
it
was
a
little
forcedly
i
suppose
if
you
knew
his
name
was
you
would
call
him
that
yet
would
you
billy
clapped
her
hands
and
threw
a
merry
glance
at
aunt
hannah
there
we
never
thought
of
she
gurgled
gleefully
maybe
it
now
john
you
see
he
told
us
to
try
to
guess
it
she
explained
turning
to
william
but
honestly
i
do
believe
whatever
it
is
i
ever
think
of
him
as
anything
but
jane
well
as
far
as
i
can
judge
he
has
nobody
but
himself
to
thank
for
that
so
he
ca
do
any
complaining
smiled
william
as
he
rose
to
go
well
how
about
it
bertram
i
suppose
you
going
to
stay
a
while
to
comfort
the
lonely
eh
boy
of
course
he
is
and
so
are
you
too
uncle
william
spoke
up
billy
with
affectionate
cordiality
as
if
i
let
you
go
back
to
a
forlorn
dinner
in
that
great
house
indeed
no
william
smiled
hesitated
and
sat
down
well
of
course
he
began
yes
of
course
finished
billy
quickly
i
telephone
pete
that
you
stay
here
both
of
it
was
at
this
point
that
little
kate
who
had
been
turning
interested
eyes
from
one
brother
to
the
other
interposed
a
clear
question
uncle
william
did
you
to
marry
my
billy
kate
gasped
her
mother
did
i
tell
you
her
voice
trailed
into
an
incoherent
murmur
of
remonstrance
billy
blushed
bertram
said
a
low
word
under
his
breath
aunt
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
was
almost
a
groan
william
laughed
lightly
well
my
little
lady
he
suggested
let
us
put
it
the
other
way
and
say
that
quite
probably
she
did
want
to
marry
does
she
want
to
marry
uncle
bertram
kate
gasped
billy
and
hartwell
together
this
time
fearful
of
what
might
be
coming
next
we
hope
so
nodded
uncle
william
speaking
in
a
cheerfully
voice
intended
to
discourage
curiosity
the
little
girl
frowned
and
pondered
her
elders
cast
about
in
their
minds
for
a
speedy
change
of
subject
but
their
somewhat
scattered
wits
were
not
quick
enough
it
was
little
kate
who
spoke
next
uncle
william
would
she
have
got
uncle
cyril
if
aunt
marie
nabbed
him
first
kate
the
word
was
a
chorus
of
dismay
this
time
hartwell
struggled
to
her
feet
come
come
kate
we
must
go
to
bed
she
stammered
the
little
girl
drew
back
indignantly
to
bed
why
mama
i
have
had
my
supper
yet
what
oh
sure
enough
the
lights
i
forgot
well
then
come
up
to
change
your
dress
finished
hartwell
as
with
a
despairing
look
and
gesture
she
led
her
young
daughter
from
the
room
chapter
xiv
j
makes
another
move
billy
came
on
the
thirteenth
of
december
to
find
everywhere
the
peculiar
flatness
that
always
follows
a
day
which
for
weeks
has
been
the
focus
of
one
aims
and
thoughts
and
labor
it
just
as
if
everything
had
stopped
at
marie
wedding
and
there
was
anything
more
to
do
she
complained
to
aunt
hannah
at
the
breakfast
table
everything
seems
so
queer
it
wo
long
dear
smiled
aunt
hannah
tranquilly
as
she
buttered
her
roll
specially
after
bertram
comes
back
how
long
does
he
stay
in
new
york
only
three
days
but
i
just
sure
it
going
to
seem
three
weeks
now
sighed
billy
but
he
simply
had
to
go
else
he
would
have
i
no
doubt
of
it
observed
aunt
hannah
and
at
the
meaning
emphasis
of
her
words
billy
laughed
a
little
after
a
minute
she
said
aggrievedly
i
had
supposed
that
i
could
at
least
have
a
sort
of
the
celebration
this
morning
picking
up
and
straightening
things
around
but
john
and
rosa
have
done
it
all
there
is
so
much
as
a
rose
leaf
anywhere
on
the
floor
of
course
most
of
the
flowers
went
to
the
hospital
last
night
anyway
as
for
marie
room
it
looks
as
as
if
it
had
never
seen
a
scrap
of
ribbon
or
an
inch
of
but
the
wedding
presents
all
carried
down
to
the
kitchen
and
half
packed
now
ready
to
go
over
to
the
new
home
john
says
he
take
them
over
in
peggy
this
afternoon
after
he
takes
hartwell
trunk
to
uncle
well
you
can
at
least
go
over
to
the
apartment
and
work
suggested
aunt
hannah
hopefully
humph
can
i
scoffed
billy
as
if
i
could
when
marie
left
strict
orders
that
not
one
thing
was
to
be
touched
till
she
got
here
they
arranged
everything
but
the
presents
before
the
wedding
anyway
and
marie
wants
to
fix
those
herself
after
she
gets
back
mercy
aunt
hannah
if
i
should
so
much
as
move
a
plate
one
inch
in
the
china
closet
marie
would
know
it
and
change
it
when
she
got
home
laughed
billy
as
she
rose
from
the
table
no
i
ca
go
to
work
over
but
there
your
music
my
dear
you
said
you
were
going
to
write
some
new
songs
after
the
i
was
sighed
billy
walking
to
the
window
and
looking
listlessly
at
the
bare
brown
world
outside
but
i
ca
write
songs
when
there
are
any
songs
in
my
head
to
no
of
course
not
but
they
come
dear
in
time
you
tired
now
soothed
aunt
hannah
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
it
the
reaction
of
course
murmured
aunt
hannah
to
herself
on
the
way
she
had
the
whole
thing
on
her
hands
dear
child
a
few
minutes
later
from
the
came
a
plaintive
little
minor
melody
billy
was
at
the
piano
kate
and
little
kate
had
the
night
before
gone
home
with
william
it
had
been
a
sudden
decision
brought
about
by
the
realization
that
bertram
trip
to
new
york
would
leave
william
alone
her
trunk
was
to
be
carried
there
and
she
would
leave
for
home
from
there
at
the
end
of
a
two
or
three
days
visit
it
began
to
snow
at
twelve
all
the
morning
the
sky
had
been
gray
and
threatening
and
the
threats
took
visible
shape
at
noon
in
myriads
of
white
snow
feathers
that
filled
the
air
to
the
blinding
point
and
turned
the
brown
bare
world
into
a
thing
of
fairylike
beauty
billy
however
with
a
rare
frown
upon
her
face
looked
out
upon
it
with
disapproving
eyes
i
going
in
town
and
i
believe
i
go
now
she
cried
do
dear
please
do
begged
aunt
hannah
see
the
flakes
are
smaller
now
and
the
wind
is
coming
up
we
in
for
a
blizzard
sure
we
are
and
you
know
you
have
some
cold
all
right
sighed
billy
then
it
me
for
the
knitting
work
and
the
fire
i
suppose
she
finished
with
a
whimsicality
that
did
not
hide
the
wistful
disappointment
of
her
voice
she
was
not
knitting
however
she
was
sewing
with
aunt
hannah
when
at
four
rosa
brought
in
the
card
billy
glanced
at
the
name
then
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
glad
little
cry
it
mary
jane
she
exclaimed
as
rosa
disappeared
now
was
he
a
dear
to
think
to
come
you
be
down
wo
you
aunt
hannah
smiled
even
while
she
frowned
oh
billy
she
remonstrated
yes
i
come
down
of
course
a
little
later
and
i
glad
came
she
said
with
reproving
emphasis
billy
laughed
and
threw
a
mischievous
glance
over
her
shoulder
all
right
she
nodded
i
go
and
tell
you
be
down
in
the
billy
greeted
her
visitor
with
a
frankly
cordial
hand
how
did
you
know
arkwright
that
i
was
feeling
specially
restless
and
lonesome
she
demanded
a
glad
light
sprang
to
the
man
dark
eyes
i
did
know
it
he
rejoined
i
only
knew
that
i
was
specially
restless
and
lonesome
arkwright
voice
was
not
quite
steady
the
unmistakable
friendliness
in
the
girl
words
and
manner
had
sent
a
quick
throb
of
joy
to
his
heart
her
evident
delight
in
his
coming
had
filled
him
with
rapture
he
could
not
know
that
it
was
only
the
chill
of
the
snowstorm
that
had
given
warmth
to
her
handclasp
the
dreariness
of
the
day
that
had
made
her
greeting
so
cordial
the
loneliness
of
a
maiden
whose
lover
is
away
that
had
made
his
presence
so
welcome
well
i
glad
you
came
anyway
sighed
billy
contentedly
though
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
sorry
that
you
were
lonesome
but
i
afraid
not
for
now
you
know
just
how
i
felt
so
you
wo
mind
if
i
a
little
wild
and
erratic
you
see
the
tension
has
snapped
she
added
laughingly
as
she
seated
herself
tension
the
wedding
you
know
for
so
many
weeks
we
been
seeing
just
december
twelfth
that
we
apparently
forgotten
all
about
the
thirteenth
that
came
after
it
so
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
felt
just
as
you
do
when
the
clock
has
stopped
ticking
but
it
was
a
lovely
wedding
arkwright
i
sorry
you
could
not
be
thank
you
so
am
i
though
usually
i
will
confess
i
not
much
good
at
attending
and
meeting
strangers
as
perhaps
guessed
miss
neilson
i
not
particularly
a
society
of
course
you
are
people
who
are
doing
things
real
things
seldom
are
but
we
are
the
society
kind
ourselves
you
know
not
the
capital
s
kind
we
like
sociability
which
is
vastly
different
from
liking
society
oh
we
have
friends
to
be
sure
who
dote
on
teas
and
purple
pageants
as
cyril
calls
them
and
we
even
go
ourselves
sometimes
but
if
you
had
been
here
yesterday
arkwright
you
have
met
lots
like
yourself
men
and
women
who
are
doing
things
singing
playing
painting
illustrating
writing
why
we
even
had
a
poet
sir
only
he
did
have
long
hair
so
he
did
look
the
part
a
bit
she
finished
laughingly
is
long
hair
necessary
for
poets
arkwright
smile
was
quizzical
dear
me
no
not
now
but
it
used
to
be
did
it
and
for
painters
too
but
now
they
look
just
like
arkwright
laughed
it
is
possible
that
you
are
sighing
for
the
velvet
coats
and
flowing
ties
of
the
past
is
it
miss
neilson
i
afraid
it
is
dimpled
billy
i
velvet
coats
and
flowing
ties
may
singers
wear
them
i
shall
don
them
at
once
anyhow
at
a
venture
declared
the
man
promptly
billy
smiled
and
shook
her
head
i
do
think
you
will
you
all
like
your
horrid
fuzzy
tweeds
and
worsteds
too
well
you
speak
with
feeling
one
would
almost
suspect
that
you
already
had
tried
to
bring
about
a
reform
and
failed
perhaps
cyril
now
or
bertram
arkwright
stopped
with
a
whimsical
smile
billy
flushed
a
little
as
it
happened
she
had
indeed
had
a
merry
tilt
with
bertram
on
that
very
subject
and
he
had
laughingly
promised
that
his
wedding
present
to
her
would
be
a
velvet
house
coat
for
himself
it
was
on
the
point
of
billy
tongue
now
to
say
this
to
arkwright
but
another
glance
at
the
provoking
smile
on
his
lips
drove
the
words
back
in
angry
confusion
for
the
second
time
in
the
presence
of
this
man
billy
found
herself
unable
to
refer
to
her
engagement
to
bertram
henshaw
though
this
time
she
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
that
arkwright
already
knew
of
it
with
a
little
gesture
of
playful
scorn
she
rose
and
went
to
the
piano
come
let
us
try
some
duets
she
suggested
that
lots
nicer
than
quarrelling
over
velvet
coats
and
aunt
hannah
will
be
down
presently
to
hear
us
before
she
had
ceased
speaking
arkwright
was
at
her
side
with
an
exclamation
of
eager
acquiescence
it
was
after
the
second
duet
that
arkwright
asked
a
little
diffidently
have
you
written
any
new
songs
lately
you
going
to
perhaps
if
i
find
one
to
you
mean
you
have
no
words
yes
and
no
i
have
some
words
both
of
my
own
and
other
people
but
i
have
found
in
any
one
of
them
yet
a
arkwright
hesitated
his
right
hand
went
almost
to
his
inner
coat
pocket
then
fell
back
at
his
side
the
next
moment
he
picked
up
a
sheet
of
music
are
you
too
tired
to
try
this
he
asked
a
puzzled
frown
appeared
on
billy
face
why
no
but
well
children
i
come
down
to
hear
the
music
announced
aunt
hannah
smilingly
from
the
doorway
only
billy
you
run
up
and
get
my
pink
shawl
too
this
room
colder
than
i
thought
and
there
only
the
white
one
down
of
course
cried
billy
rising
at
once
you
shall
have
a
dozen
shawls
if
you
like
she
laughed
as
she
left
the
room
what
a
cozy
time
it
was
the
hour
that
followed
after
billy
returned
with
the
pink
shawl
outside
the
wind
howled
at
the
windows
and
flung
the
snow
against
the
glass
in
sleety
crashes
inside
the
man
and
the
girl
sang
duets
until
they
were
tired
then
with
aunt
hannah
they
feasted
royally
on
the
buttered
toast
tea
and
frosted
cakes
that
rosa
served
on
a
little
table
before
the
roaring
fire
it
was
then
that
arkwright
talked
of
himself
telling
them
something
of
his
studies
and
of
the
life
he
was
living
after
all
you
see
there
just
this
difference
between
my
friends
and
yours
he
said
at
last
your
friends
doing
things
succeeded
mine
have
yet
they
only
but
they
will
succeed
cried
billy
some
of
them
amended
the
man
not
all
of
them
billy
looked
a
little
troubled
arkwright
shook
his
head
slowly
no
they
could
all
of
them
you
know
some
have
the
talent
some
have
the
perseverance
and
some
have
the
but
all
that
seems
such
a
they
tried
grieved
billy
it
is
a
pity
miss
neilson
disappointed
hopes
are
always
a
pity
are
they
sighed
the
girl
but
if
there
were
only
something
one
could
do
to
help
arkwright
eyes
grew
deep
with
feeling
but
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
purposely
light
i
afraid
that
would
be
quite
too
big
a
contract
for
even
your
generosity
miss
neilson
to
mend
all
the
broken
hopes
in
the
world
he
prophesied
i
have
known
great
good
to
come
from
great
disappointments
remarked
aunt
hannah
a
bit
didactically
so
have
i
laughed
arkwright
still
determined
to
drive
the
troubled
shadow
from
the
face
he
was
watching
so
intently
for
instance
a
fellow
i
know
was
feeling
all
cut
up
last
friday
because
he
was
just
too
late
to
get
into
symphony
hall
on
the
admission
half
an
hour
afterwards
his
disappointment
was
turned
to
joy
a
friend
who
had
an
orchestra
chair
could
use
his
ticket
that
day
and
so
handed
it
over
to
billy
turned
interestedly
what
are
those
tickets
to
the
symphony
then
you
do
know
not
exactly
i
heard
of
them
in
a
vague
then
you
missed
one
of
the
sights
of
boston
if
you
have
ever
seen
that
long
line
of
patient
waiters
at
the
door
of
symphony
hall
of
a
friday
morning
but
the
concert
is
till
afternoon
no
but
the
waiting
is
retorted
arkwright
you
see
those
admissions
are
limited
five
hundred
and
five
i
believe
and
they
rush
seats
at
that
first
come
first
served
and
if
you
too
late
you
served
at
all
so
the
first
arrival
comes
bright
and
early
i
heard
that
he
has
been
known
to
come
at
peep
of
day
when
there
a
paderewski
or
a
melba
for
a
drawing
card
but
i
got
my
doubts
of
that
anyhow
i
never
saw
them
there
much
before
eight
but
many
the
cold
stormy
day
i
seen
those
steps
in
front
of
the
hall
packed
for
hours
and
a
long
line
reaching
away
up
the
billy
eyes
widened
and
they
stand
all
that
time
and
wait
to
be
sure
they
will
you
see
each
pays
cents
at
the
door
until
the
limit
is
reached
then
the
rest
are
turned
away
naturally
they
do
want
to
be
turned
away
so
they
try
to
get
there
early
enough
to
be
among
the
fortunate
five
hundred
and
five
besides
the
earlier
you
are
the
better
seat
you
are
likely
to
but
only
think
of
all
that
time
oh
they
bring
camp
chairs
sometimes
i
heard
and
then
there
are
the
steps
you
do
know
what
a
really
fine
seat
a
stone
step
is
if
you
have
a
enough
bundle
of
newspapers
to
cushion
it
with
they
bring
their
luncheons
too
with
books
papers
and
knitting
work
for
fine
days
i
been
told
some
of
them
all
the
comforts
of
home
you
see
smiled
arkwright
why
how
how
dreadful
stammered
billy
oh
but
they
do
think
it
dreadful
at
all
corrected
arkwright
quickly
for
cents
they
can
hear
all
that
you
hear
down
in
your
orchestra
chair
for
which
you
paid
so
high
a
but
who
who
are
they
where
do
they
come
from
who
go
and
stand
hours
like
that
to
get
a
seat
questioned
billy
who
are
they
anybody
everybody
from
anywhere
everywhere
people
who
have
the
music
hunger
but
not
the
money
to
satisfy
it
he
rejoined
students
teachers
a
little
milliner
from
south
boston
a
little
dressmaker
from
chelsea
a
housewife
from
cambridge
a
stranger
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
maybe
a
widow
who
used
to
sit
or
a
professor
who
has
seen
better
days
really
to
know
that
line
you
should
see
it
for
yourself
miss
neilson
smiled
arkwright
as
he
reluctantly
rose
to
go
some
friday
however
before
you
take
your
seat
just
glance
up
at
that
packed
top
balcony
and
judge
by
the
faces
you
see
there
whether
their
owners
think
they
getting
their
worth
or
i
will
nodded
billy
with
a
smile
but
the
smile
came
from
her
lips
only
not
her
eyes
billy
was
wishing
at
that
moment
that
she
owned
the
whole
of
symphony
hall
to
give
away
but
that
was
like
billy
when
she
was
seven
years
old
she
had
proposed
to
her
aunt
ella
that
they
take
all
the
orphans
from
the
hampden
falls
orphan
asylum
to
live
with
them
so
that
little
sallie
cook
and
the
other
orphans
might
have
ice
cream
every
day
if
they
wanted
it
since
then
billy
had
always
been
trying
in
a
way
to
give
ice
cream
to
some
one
who
wanted
it
arkwright
was
almost
at
the
door
when
he
turned
abruptly
his
face
was
an
abashed
red
from
his
pocket
he
had
taken
a
small
folded
paper
do
you
suppose
in
this
you
might
find
that
melody
he
stammered
in
a
low
voice
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
having
left
in
billy
fingers
a
paper
upon
which
was
written
in
a
masculine
hand
six
stanzas
billy
read
them
at
once
hurriedly
then
more
carefully
why
they
beautiful
she
breathed
just
beautiful
where
did
he
get
them
i
wonder
it
a
love
song
and
such
a
pretty
one
i
believe
there
a
melody
in
it
she
exulted
pausing
to
hum
a
line
or
two
there
is
i
know
there
is
and
i
write
it
for
bertram
she
finished
crossing
joyously
to
the
piano
down
corey
hill
at
that
moment
arkwright
was
buffeting
the
wind
and
snow
he
too
was
thinking
joyously
of
those
stanzas
joyously
yet
at
the
same
time
fearfully
arkwright
himself
had
written
those
lines
though
not
for
bertram
chapter
xv
mr
billy
and
miss
mary
jane
on
the
fourteenth
of
december
billy
came
alert
interested
and
happy
she
had
received
a
dear
letter
from
bertram
mailed
on
the
way
to
new
york
the
sun
was
shining
and
her
fingers
were
fairly
tingling
to
put
on
paper
the
little
melody
that
was
now
surging
riotously
through
her
brain
emphatically
the
restlessness
of
the
day
before
was
gone
now
once
more
billy
clock
had
begun
to
after
breakfast
billy
went
straight
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
arkwright
even
one
side
of
the
conversation
aunt
hannah
did
not
hear
very
clearly
but
in
five
minutes
a
billy
danced
into
the
room
aunt
hannah
just
listen
only
think
mary
jane
wrote
the
words
himself
so
of
course
i
can
use
them
billy
dear
you
say
arkwright
pleaded
aunt
hannah
billy
laughed
and
gave
the
little
old
lady
an
impulsive
hug
of
course
i
say
majesty
if
you
like
dear
she
chuckled
but
did
you
hear
did
you
realize
they
his
own
words
so
there
no
question
of
rights
or
permission
or
anything
and
he
coming
up
this
afternoon
to
hear
my
melody
and
to
make
a
few
little
changes
in
the
words
maybe
oh
aunt
hannah
you
do
know
how
good
it
seems
to
get
into
my
music
again
yes
yes
dear
of
course
but
aunt
hannah
sentence
ended
in
a
vaguely
troubled
pause
billy
turned
in
surprise
why
aunt
hannah
are
you
glad
you
you
be
glad
yes
dear
and
i
am
very
glad
it
only
if
it
does
take
too
much
time
and
if
bertram
does
billy
flushed
she
laughed
a
little
bitterly
no
it
wo
take
too
much
time
i
fancy
and
so
far
as
bertram
is
concerned
if
what
sister
kate
says
is
true
aunt
hannah
he
be
glad
to
have
me
occupy
a
little
of
my
time
with
something
besides
fiddlededee
bristled
aunt
hannah
what
did
she
mean
by
that
billy
smiled
ruefully
well
probably
i
did
need
it
she
said
it
night
before
last
just
before
she
went
home
with
uncle
william
she
declared
that
i
seemed
to
forget
entirely
that
bertram
belonged
to
his
art
first
before
he
belonged
to
me
and
that
it
was
exactly
as
she
had
supposed
it
would
be
a
perfect
absurdity
for
bertram
to
think
of
marrying
fiddlededee
ejaculated
the
irate
aunt
hannah
even
more
sharply
i
hope
you
have
too
much
good
sense
to
mind
what
kate
says
yes
i
know
sighed
the
girl
but
of
course
i
can
see
some
things
for
myself
and
i
suppose
i
did
make
a
little
fuss
about
his
going
to
new
york
the
other
night
and
i
will
own
that
i
had
a
real
struggle
with
myself
sometimes
lately
not
to
mind
his
giving
so
much
time
to
his
portrait
painting
and
of
course
both
of
those
are
very
reprehensible
in
an
artist
wife
she
finished
a
little
tremulously
humph
well
i
do
think
i
should
worry
about
that
observed
aunt
hannah
with
grim
positiveness
no
i
do
mean
to
smiled
billy
wistfully
i
only
told
you
so
you
understand
that
it
was
just
as
well
if
i
did
have
something
to
take
up
my
mind
besides
bertram
and
of
course
music
would
be
the
most
natural
yes
of
course
agreed
aunt
hannah
and
it
seems
actually
almost
providential
that
mary
i
mean
arkwright
is
here
to
help
me
now
that
cyril
is
gone
went
on
billy
still
a
little
wistfully
yes
of
course
he
is
like
a
stranger
murmured
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
voice
sounded
as
if
she
were
trying
to
convince
herself
of
something
no
indeed
he
seems
just
like
one
of
the
family
to
me
almost
as
if
he
were
really
your
niece
mary
jane
laughed
billy
aunt
hannah
moved
restlessly
billy
she
hazarded
he
knows
of
course
of
your
engagement
why
of
course
he
does
aunt
hannah
everybody
does
billy
eyes
were
plainly
surprised
yes
yes
of
course
he
must
subsided
aunt
hannah
confusedly
hoping
that
billy
would
not
divine
the
hidden
reason
behind
her
question
she
was
relieved
when
billy
next
words
showed
that
she
had
not
divined
it
i
told
you
did
i
he
coming
up
this
afternoon
he
ca
get
here
till
five
though
but
he
so
interested
he
about
as
crazy
over
the
thing
as
i
am
and
it
going
to
be
fine
aunt
hannah
when
it
done
you
just
wait
and
see
she
finished
gayly
as
she
tripped
from
the
room
left
to
herself
aunt
hannah
drew
a
long
breath
i
glad
she
did
suspect
she
was
thinking
i
believe
consider
even
the
disloyal
to
bertram
dear
child
and
of
course
mary
aunt
hannah
corrected
herself
with
cheeks
aflame
i
mean
arkwright
does
it
was
just
here
however
that
aunt
hannah
was
mistaken
arkwright
did
not
know
he
had
not
reached
boston
when
the
engagement
was
announced
he
knew
none
of
billy
friends
in
town
save
the
henshaw
brothers
he
had
not
heard
from
calderwell
since
he
came
to
boston
the
very
evident
intimacy
of
billy
with
the
henshaw
brothers
he
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
knowing
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
and
the
fact
that
billy
was
william
henshaw
namesake
as
to
bertram
being
billy
lover
that
idea
had
long
ago
been
killed
at
birth
by
calderwell
emphatic
assertion
that
the
artist
would
never
care
for
any
girl
except
to
paint
since
coming
to
boston
arkwright
had
seen
little
of
the
two
together
his
work
his
friends
and
his
general
mode
of
life
precluded
that
because
of
all
this
therefore
arkwright
did
not
know
which
was
a
pity
for
arkwright
and
for
some
others
promptly
at
five
that
afternoon
arkwright
rang
doorbell
and
was
admitted
by
rosa
to
the
where
billy
was
at
the
piano
billy
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
joyous
word
of
greeting
i
so
glad
you
come
she
sighed
happily
i
want
you
to
hear
the
melody
your
pretty
words
have
sung
to
me
though
maybe
after
all
you
wo
like
it
you
know
she
finished
with
arch
wistfulness
as
if
i
could
help
liking
it
smiled
the
man
trying
to
keep
from
his
voice
the
ecstatic
delight
that
the
touch
of
her
hand
had
brought
him
billy
shook
her
head
and
seated
herself
again
at
the
piano
the
words
are
lovely
she
declared
sorting
out
two
or
three
sheets
of
manuscript
music
from
the
quantity
on
the
rack
before
her
but
one
place
the
rhythm
you
know
if
you
could
change
it
there
but
listen
first
i
going
to
play
it
straight
through
to
and
she
dropped
her
fingers
to
the
keyboard
the
next
moment
a
tenderly
sweet
melody
with
only
a
chord
now
and
then
for
accompaniment
filled
arkwright
soul
with
rapture
then
billy
began
to
sing
very
softly
the
words
no
wonder
arkwright
soul
was
filled
with
rapture
they
were
his
words
wrung
straight
from
his
heart
and
they
were
being
sung
by
the
girl
for
whom
they
were
written
they
were
being
sung
with
feeling
too
so
evident
a
feeling
that
the
man
pulse
quickened
and
his
eyes
flashed
a
sudden
fire
arkwright
could
not
know
of
course
that
billy
in
her
own
mind
was
singing
that
song
to
bertram
henshaw
the
fire
was
still
in
arkwright
eyes
when
the
song
was
ended
but
billy
very
plainly
did
not
see
it
with
a
frowning
sigh
and
a
murmured
there
she
began
to
talk
of
rhythm
and
accent
and
cadence
and
to
point
out
with
anxious
care
why
three
syllables
instead
of
two
were
needed
at
the
end
of
a
certain
line
from
this
she
passed
eagerly
to
the
accompaniment
and
arkwright
at
once
found
himself
lost
in
a
maze
of
minor
thirds
and
diminished
sevenths
until
he
was
forced
to
turn
from
the
singer
to
the
song
still
watching
her
a
little
later
he
noticed
her
absorbed
face
and
eager
enthusiasm
her
earnest
pursuance
of
an
elusive
harmony
and
he
wondered
did
she
or
did
she
not
sing
that
song
with
feeling
a
little
while
before
arkwright
had
not
settled
this
question
to
his
own
satisfaction
when
aunt
hannah
came
in
at
five
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
vague
disappointment
as
he
rose
to
greet
her
billy
however
turned
an
untroubled
face
to
the
newcomer
we
doing
finely
aunt
hannah
she
cried
then
suddenly
she
flung
a
laughing
question
to
the
man
how
about
it
sir
are
we
going
to
put
on
the
by
mary
jane
arkwright
or
will
you
unveil
the
mystery
for
us
now
have
you
guessed
it
he
bantered
no
unless
it
john
we
did
think
of
that
the
other
wrong
again
he
laughed
then
it
have
to
be
jane
retorted
billy
with
calm
naughtiness
refusing
to
meet
aunt
hannah
beseechingly
reproving
eyes
then
suddenly
she
chuckled
it
would
be
a
combination
would
it
by
mary
jane
arkwright
music
by
billy
neilson
we
have
sighing
swains
writing
to
miss
arkwright
telling
how
touching
were
words
and
lovelorn
damsels
thanking
neilson
for
music
billy
my
dear
remonstrated
aunt
hannah
faintly
yes
yes
i
know
that
was
bad
and
i
wo
again
truly
promised
billy
but
her
eyes
danced
and
the
next
moment
she
had
whirled
about
on
the
piano
stool
and
dashed
into
a
chopin
waltz
the
room
itself
then
seemed
to
be
full
of
the
twinkling
feet
of
elves
chapter
xvi
a
girl
and
a
bit
of
lowestoft
immediately
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
billy
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
oh
good
morning
uncle
william
she
called
in
answer
to
the
masculine
voice
that
replied
to
her
billy
are
you
very
busy
this
morning
no
indeed
not
if
you
want
well
i
do
my
uncle
william
voice
was
troubled

a
teapot

genuine
lowestoft

at
park
street
she
at
the
west
end
i
do
dare
to
put
it
off
for
fear
i
lose
it
harlow
says
others
will
have
to
know
of
it
of
course
you
see
she
just
made
up
her
mind
to
sell
it
and
asked
him
to
find
a
customer
i
would
trouble
you
but
he
says
they

the
daughter

careful
handling
that
why
i
wanted
you
though
i
wanted
you
to
see
the
too
it
be
yours
some
day
you
billy
all
alone
at
her
end
of
the
line
blushed
that
she
was
one
day
to
be
mistress
of
the
strata
and
all
it
contained
was
still
anything
but
common
to
her
i
love
to
see
it
and
i
come
gladly
but
i
afraid
i
wo
be
much
help
uncle
william
she
worried
i
take
the
risk
of
that
you
see
harlow
says
that
about
half
the
time
she
is
sure
she
wants
to
sell
it
after
why
how
funny
well
i

at

park
street

she

by
the
way
i
going
to
bring
you
home
to
luncheon
kate
leaves
this
afternoon
you
know
and
it
been
so
snowy
she
thought
best
to
try
to
get
over
to
the
house
maybe
aunt
hannah
would
come
too
for
luncheon
would
she
i
afraid
not
returned
billy
with
a
rueful
laugh
she
got
shawls
on
this
morning
and
you
know
that
always
means
that
she
felt
a
draft
somewhere
poor
dear
i
tell
her
though
and
see
you
at
eleven
finished
billy
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
promptly
at
the
appointed
time
billy
met
uncle
william
at
park
street
and
together
they
set
out
for
the
west
end
street
named
on
the
paper
in
his
pocket
but
when
the
shabby
house
on
the
narrow
little
street
was
reached
the
man
looked
about
him
with
a
troubled
frown
i
declare
billy
i
not
sure
but
we
better
turn
back
he
fretted
i
did
mean
to
take
you
to
such
a
place
as
billy
shivered
a
little
but
after
one
glance
at
the
man
disappointed
face
she
lifted
a
determined
chin
nonsense
uncle
william
of
course
you
wo
turn
back
i
mind
for
myself
but
only
think
of
the
people
whose
are
here
she
finished
just
above
her
breath
greggory
was
found
to
be
living
in
two
back
rooms
at
the
top
of
four
flights
of
stairs
up
which
william
henshaw
toiled
with
increasing
weariness
and
dismay
punctuating
each
flight
with
a
despairing
billy
really
i
think
we
should
turn
back
but
billy
would
not
turn
back
and
at
last
they
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
who
said
yes
she
was
greggory
yes
she
was
even
as
she
uttered
the
words
however
she
looked
fearfully
over
her
shoulders
as
if
expecting
to
hear
from
the
hall
behind
them
a
voice
denying
her
assertion
greggory
was
a
cripple
her
slender
little
body
was
poised
on
two
crutches
both
the
worn
places
on
the
crutches
and
the
skill
with
which
the
little
woman
swung
herself
about
the
room
testified
that
the
crippled
condition
was
not
a
new
one
billy
eyes
were
brimming
with
pity
and
dismay
mechanically
she
had
taken
the
chair
toward
which
greggory
had
motioned
her
she
had
tried
not
to
seem
to
look
about
her
but
there
was
not
one
detail
of
the
bare
little
room
from
its
faded
rug
to
the
patched
but
spotless
tablecloth
that
was
not
stamped
on
her
brain
greggory
had
seated
herself
now
and
william
henshaw
had
cleared
his
throat
nervously
billy
did
not
know
whether
she
herself
were
the
more
distressed
or
the
more
relieved
to
hear
him
stammer
we
er
i
came
from
harlow
greggory
he
gave
me
to
understand
you
had
an
er
teapot
that
er
with
his
eyes
on
the
cracked
white
crockery
pitcher
on
the
table
william
henshaw
came
to
a
helpless
pause
a
curious
expression
or
rather
series
of
expressions
crossed
greggory
face
terror
joy
dismay
and
relief
seemed
one
after
the
other
to
fight
for
supremacy
relief
in
the
end
conquered
though
even
yet
there
was
a
second
hurriedly
apprehensive
glance
toward
the
door
before
she
spoke
the
lowestoft
yes
i
so
glad
that
is
of
course
i
must
be
glad
i
get
her
voice
broke
as
she
pulled
herself
from
her
chair
there
was
only
despairing
sorrow
on
her
face
now
the
man
rose
at
once
but
madam
perhaps
do
let
me
i
he
began
stammeringly
of
course
billy
he
broke
off
in
an
entirely
different
voice
jove
what
a
beauty
greggory
had
thrown
open
the
door
of
a
small
cupboard
near
the
collector
chair
disclosing
on
one
of
the
shelves
a
beautifully
shaped
teapot
creamy
in
tint
and
exquisitely
decorated
in
a
rose
design
near
it
set
a
plate
of
the
same
ware
and
decoration
if
you
lift
it
down
please
yourself
motioned
greggory
i
do
like
to
with
these
she
explained
tapping
the
crutches
at
her
side
with
fingers
that
were
almost
reverent
in
their
appreciation
the
collector
reached
for
the
teapot
his
eyes
sparkled
billy
look
what
a
beauty
and
it
a
lowestoft
too
the
real
thing
the
genuine
true
soft
paste
and
there
the
tray
did
you
notice
he
exulted
turning
back
to
the
shelf
you
see
that
every
day
they
get
separated
most
generally
you
these
pieces
have
been
in
our
family
for
generations
said
greggory
with
an
accent
of
pride
you
find
them
quite
perfect
i
perfect
i
should
say
they
were
cried
the
man
they
are
then
valuable
greggory
voice
shook
indeed
they
are
but
you
must
know
i
have
been
told
so
yet
to
me
their
chief
value
of
course
lies
in
their
association
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
owned
that
teapot
again
her
voice
broke
william
henshaw
cleared
his
throat
but
madam
if
you
do
not
wish
to
sell
he
stopped
abruptly
his
longing
eyes
had
gone
back
to
the
enticing
bit
of
china
greggory
gave
a
low
cry
but
i
do
that
is
i
must
harlow
says
that
it
is
valuable
and
that
it
will
bring
in
money
and
we
need
she
threw
a
quick
glance
toward
the
hall
door
though
she
did
not
pause
in
her
remarks
i
ca
do
much
at
work
that
pays
i
sew
she
nodded
toward
the
machine
by
the
window
but
with
only
one
foot
to
make
it
go
you
see
the
other
is
is
inclined
to
shirk
a
little
she
finished
with
a
wistful
whimsicality
billy
turned
away
sharply
there
was
a
lump
in
her
throat
and
a
smart
in
her
eyes
she
was
conscious
suddenly
of
a
fierce
anger
against
she
did
not
know
what
exactly
but
she
fancied
it
was
against
the
teapot
or
against
uncle
william
for
wanting
the
teapot
or
for
wanting
it
if
he
did
not
buy
it
and
so
you
see
i
do
very
much
wish
to
greggory
said
then
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
it
would
be
worth
to
you
she
concluded
tremulously
the
collector
eyes
glowed
he
picked
up
the
teapot
with
careful
rapture
and
examined
it
then
he
turned
to
the
tray
after
a
moment
he
spoke
i
have
only
one
other
in
my
collection
as
rare
he
said
i
paid
a
hundred
dollars
for
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
the
same
for
this
greggory
started
visibly
a
hundred
dollars
so
much
as
that
she
cried
almost
joyously
why
nothing
else
that
we
had
has
brought
of
course
if
it
worth
that
to
you
she
paused
suddenly
a
quick
step
had
sounded
in
the
hall
outside
the
next
moment
the
door
flew
open
and
a
young
woman
who
looked
to
be
about
or
years
old
burst
into
the
room
mother
only
think
i
she
stopped
and
drew
back
a
little
her
startled
eyes
went
from
one
face
to
another
then
dropped
to
the
lowestoft
teapot
in
the
man
hands
her
expression
changed
at
once
she
shut
the
door
quickly
and
hurried
forward
mother
what
is
it
who
are
these
people
she
asked
sharply
billy
lifted
her
chin
the
least
bit
she
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
which
she
could
not
name
billy
was
not
used
to
being
called
these
people
in
precisely
that
tone
of
voice
william
henshaw
too
raised
his
chin
he
also
was
not
in
the
habit
of
being
referred
to
as
these
my
name
is
henshaw
miss
greggory
i
presume
he
said
quietly
i
was
sent
here
by
about
the
teapot
my
dear
you
know
stammered
greggory
wetting
her
lips
with
an
air
of
hurried
apology
and
conciliation
this
gentleman
says
he
will
be
glad
to
buy
it
er
my
daughter
alice
henshaw
she
hastened
on
in
embarrassed
introduction
and
miss
neilson
supplied
the
man
as
she
looked
at
billy
and
hesitated
a
swift
red
stained
alice
greggory
face
with
barely
an
acknowledgment
of
the
introductions
she
turned
to
her
mother
yes
dear
but
that
wo
be
necessary
now
as
i
started
to
tell
you
when
i
came
in
i
have
two
new
pupils
and
so
turning
to
the
man
again
i
thank
you
for
your
offer
but
we
have
decided
not
to
sell
the
teapot
at
as
she
finished
her
sentence
she
stepped
one
side
as
if
to
make
room
for
the
strangers
to
reach
the
door
william
henshaw
frowned
angrily
that
was
the
man
but
his
eyes
the
collector
eyes
sought
the
teapot
longingly
before
either
the
man
or
the
collector
could
speak
however
greggory
interposed
quick
words
of
remonstrance
but
alice
my
dear
she
almost
sobbed
you
did
wait
to
let
me
tell
you
henshaw
says
it
is
worth
a
hundred
dollars
to
him
he
will
give
us
a
hundred
a
hundred
dollars
echoed
the
girl
faintly
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
she
was
wavering
billy
watching
the
little
scene
with
mingled
emotions
saw
the
glance
with
which
the
girl
swept
the
bare
little
room
and
she
knew
that
there
was
not
a
patch
or
darn
or
poverty
spot
in
sight
or
out
of
sight
which
that
glance
did
not
encompass
billy
was
wondering
which
she
herself
desired
more
that
uncle
william
should
buy
the
lowestoft
or
that
he
should
not
she
knew
she
wished
greggory
to
have
the
hundred
dollars
there
was
no
doubt
on
that
point
then
uncle
william
spoke
his
words
carried
the
righteous
indignation
of
the
man
who
thinks
he
has
been
unjustly
treated
and
the
final
plea
of
the
collector
who
sees
a
coveted
treasure
slipping
from
his
grasp
i
am
very
sorry
of
course
if
my
offer
has
annoyed
you
he
said
stiffly
i
certainly
should
not
have
made
it
had
i
not
had
greggory
assurance
that
she
wished
to
sell
the
alice
greggory
turned
as
if
stung
to
sell
she
repeated
the
words
with
superb
disdain
she
was
plainly
very
angry
her
eyes
gleamed
with
scorn
and
her
whole
face
was
suffused
with
a
red
that
had
swept
to
the
roots
of
her
soft
hair
do
you
think
a
woman
to
sell
a
thing
that
treasured
all
her
life
a
thing
that
is
perhaps
the
last
visible
reminder
of
the
days
when
she
was
living
not
merely
existing
alice
alice
my
love
protested
the
cripple
agitatedly
i
ca
help
it
stormed
the
girl
hotly
i
know
how
much
you
think
of
that
teapot
that
was
grandmother
i
know
what
it
cost
you
to
make
up
your
mind
to
sell
it
at
all
and
then
to
hear
these
people
talk
about
your
to
sell
it
perhaps
they
think
too
we
to
live
in
a
place
like
this
that
we
to
have
rugs
that
are
darned
and
chairs
that
are
broken
and
garments
that
are
patches
instead
of
clothes
alice
gasped
greggory
in
dismayed
horror
with
a
little
outward
fling
of
her
two
hands
alice
greggory
stepped
back
her
face
had
grown
white
again
i
beg
your
pardon
of
course
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
bitterly
quiet
i
should
not
have
spoken
so
you
are
very
kind
henshaw
but
i
do
not
think
we
care
to
sell
the
lowestoft
both
words
and
manner
were
obviously
a
dismissal
and
with
a
puzzled
sigh
william
henshaw
picked
up
his
hat
his
face
showed
very
clearly
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
but
it
showed
too
as
clearly
that
he
longed
to
do
something
or
say
something
during
the
brief
minute
that
he
hesitated
however
billy
sprang
forward
mrs
greggory
please
wo
you
let
buy
the
teapot
and
then
wo
you
keep
it
for
me
here
i
have
the
hundred
dollars
with
me
but
i
send
it
right
away
you
will
let
me
do
it
wo
you
it
was
an
impulsive
speech
and
a
foolish
one
of
course
from
the
standpoint
of
sense
and
logic
and
reasonableness
but
it
was
one
that
might
be
expected
perhaps
from
billy
greggory
must
have
divined
in
a
way
the
spirit
that
prompted
it
for
her
eyes
grew
wet
and
with
a
choking
dear
child
she
reached
out
and
caught
billy
hand
in
both
her
own
even
while
she
shook
her
head
in
denial
not
so
her
daughter
alice
greggory
flushed
scarlet
she
drew
herself
proudly
erect
thank
you
she
said
with
crisp
coldness
but
distasteful
as
darns
and
patches
are
to
us
we
prefer
them
infinitely
to
charity
oh
but
please
i
did
mean
you
did
understand
faltered
billy
for
answer
alice
greggory
walked
deliberately
to
the
door
and
held
it
open
oh
alice
my
dear
pleaded
greggory
again
feebly
come
billy
we
bid
you
good
morning
ladies
said
william
henshaw
then
decisively
and
billy
with
a
little
wistful
pat
on
greggory
clasped
hands
went
once
down
the
long
four
flights
of
stairs
and
out
on
the
sidewalk
william
henshaw
drew
a
long
breath
well
by
jove
billy
the
next
time
i
take
you
curio
hunting
it
be
to
this
place
he
fumed
was
it
awful
choked
billy
awful
the
girl
was
the
most
stubborn
unreasonable
vixenish
little
puss
i
ever
saw
i
did
want
her
old
lowestoft
if
she
did
want
to
sell
it
but
to
practically
invite
me
there
and
then
treat
me
like
that
scolded
the
collector
his
face
growing
red
with
anger
still
i
was
sorry
for
the
poor
little
old
lady
i
wish
somehow
she
could
have
that
hundred
dollars
it
was
the
man
who
said
this
not
the
collector
so
do
i
rejoined
billy
dolefully
but
that
girl
was
so
so
queer
she
sighed
with
a
frown
billy
was
puzzled
for
the
first
time
perhaps
in
her
life
she
knew
what
it
was
to
have
her
proffered
ice
cream
disdainfully
refused
chapter
xvii
only
a
love
song
but
kate
and
little
kate
left
for
the
west
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifteenth
and
bertram
arrived
from
new
york
that
evening
notwithstanding
the
confusion
of
all
this
billy
still
had
time
to
give
some
thought
to
her
experience
of
the
morning
with
uncle
william
the
forlorn
little
room
with
its
furnishings
and
its
crippled
mistress
was
very
vivid
in
billy
memory
equally
vivid
were
the
flashing
eyes
of
alice
greggory
as
she
had
opened
the
door
at
the
last
for
as
billy
explained
to
bertram
that
evening
after
she
had
told
him
the
story
of
the
morning
adventure
you
see
dear
i
had
never
been
really
of
a
house
before
i
should
think
not
scowled
her
lover
indignantly
and
it
safe
to
say
you
never
will
again
the
impertinence
of
it
but
then
you
see
them
any
more
sweetheart
so
we
just
forget
forget
it
why
bertram
i
could
you
could
if
you
been
there
besides
of
course
i
shall
see
them
again
bertram
jaw
dropped
why
billy
you
do
mean
that
will
or
you
either
would
try
again
for
that
trumpery
teapot
of
course
not
flashed
billy
heatedly
it
is
the
teapot
that
dear
little
greggory
why
dearie
you
do
know
how
poor
they
are
everything
in
sight
is
so
old
and
thin
and
worn
it
enough
to
break
your
heart
the
rug
is
anything
but
darns
nor
the
tablecloth
either
except
patches
it
awful
bertram
i
know
darling
but
do
expect
to
buy
them
new
rugs
and
new
tablecloths
do
you
billy
gave
one
of
her
unexpected
laughs
mercy
she
chuckled
only
picture
miss
alice
face
if
i
try
to
buy
them
rugs
and
tablecloths
no
dear
she
went
on
more
seriously
i
do
that
of
course
though
i
like
to
but
i
shall
try
to
see
greggory
again
if
it
nothing
more
than
a
rose
or
a
book
or
a
new
magazine
that
i
can
take
to
or
a
smile
which
i
fancy
will
be
the
best
gift
of
the
lot
amended
bertram
fondly
billy
dimpled
and
shook
her
head
smiles
my
smiles
are
not
so
valuable
i
afraid
except
to
you
perhaps
she
laughed
facts
need
no
proving
retorted
bertram
well
and
what
else
has
happened
in
all
these
ages
i
been
away
billy
brought
her
hands
together
with
a
sudden
cry
oh
and
i
have
told
you
she
exclaimed
i
writing
a
new
song
a
love
song
mary
jane
wrote
the
words
they
bertram
stiffened
indeed
and
is
mary
jane
a
poet
with
all
the
rest
he
asked
with
affected
lightness
oh
no
of
course
not
smiled
billy
but
these
words
pretty
and
they
just
sang
themselves
into
the
dearest
little
melody
right
away
so
i
writing
the
music
for
lucky
mary
jane
murmured
bertram
still
with
a
lightness
that
he
hoped
would
pass
for
indifference
bertram
was
ashamed
of
himself
but
deep
within
him
was
a
growing
consciousness
that
he
knew
the
meaning
of
the
vague
irritation
that
he
always
felt
at
the
mere
mention
of
arkwright
name
and
will
the
say
by
mary
jane
arkwright
he
finished
that
what
i
asked
him
laughed
billy
i
even
suggested
john
for
a
change
oh
but
dearie
she
broke
off
with
shy
eagerness
i
just
want
you
to
hear
a
little
of
what
i
done
with
it
you
see
really
all
the
time
i
suspect
i
been
singing
it
to
you
she
confessed
with
an
endearing
blush
as
she
sprang
lightly
to
her
feet
and
hurried
to
the
piano
it
was
a
bad
ten
minutes
that
bertram
henshaw
spent
then
how
he
could
love
a
song
and
hate
it
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
understand
but
he
knew
that
he
was
doing
exactly
that
to
hear
billy
carol
sweetheart
my
sweetheart
with
that
joyous
tenderness
was
bliss
unspeakable
until
he
remembered
that
arkwright
wrote
the
sweetheart
my
sweetheart
then
it
was
even
in
his
thoughts
bertram
bit
the
word
off
short
he
was
not
a
swearing
man
when
he
looked
at
billy
now
at
the
piano
and
thought
of
her
singing
as
she
said
she
had
sung
that
song
to
him
all
through
the
last
three
days
his
heart
glowed
but
when
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
of
arkwright
who
had
made
possible
that
singing
his
heart
froze
with
terror
from
the
very
first
it
had
been
music
that
bertram
had
feared
he
could
not
forget
that
billy
herself
had
once
told
him
that
never
would
she
love
any
man
better
than
she
loved
her
music
that
she
was
not
going
to
marry
all
this
had
been
at
the
first
the
very
first
he
had
boldly
scorned
the
idea
then
and
had
said
so
it
music
a
cold
senseless
thing
of
spidery
marks
on
clean
white
paper
that
is
my
only
rival
he
had
said
too
that
he
was
going
to
win
and
he
had
won
but
not
until
after
long
weeks
of
fearing
hoping
striving
and
despairing
this
last
when
kate
blundering
had
nearly
made
her
william
wife
then
on
that
memorable
day
in
september
billy
had
walked
straight
into
his
arms
and
he
knew
that
he
had
indeed
won
that
is
he
had
supposed
that
he
knew
until
arkwright
came
very
sharply
now
as
he
listened
to
billy
singing
bertram
told
himself
to
be
reasonable
to
be
sensible
that
billy
did
indeed
love
him
was
she
not
according
to
her
own
dear
assertion
singing
that
song
to
him
but
it
was
arkwright
song
he
remembered
that
too
and
grew
faint
at
the
thought
true
he
had
won
when
his
rival
music
had
been
a
cold
senseless
thing
of
spidery
marks
on
paper
but
would
that
winning
stand
when
music
had
become
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
a
man
of
undeniable
charm
good
looks
and
winsomeness
a
man
whose
thoughts
aims
and
words
were
the
personification
of
the
thing
billy
in
the
long
ago
had
declared
she
loved
best
of
all
music
bertram
shivered
as
with
a
sudden
chill
then
billy
rose
from
the
piano
there
she
breathed
her
face
shyly
radiant
with
the
glory
of
the
song
did
you
like
it
bertram
did
his
best
but
in
his
state
of
mind
the
very
radiance
of
her
face
was
only
an
added
torture
and
his
tongue
stumbled
over
the
words
of
praise
and
appreciation
that
he
tried
to
say
he
saw
then
the
happy
light
in
billy
eyes
change
to
troubled
questioning
and
grieved
disappointment
and
he
hated
himself
for
a
jealous
brute
more
earnestly
than
ever
now
he
tried
to
force
the
ring
of
sincerity
into
his
voice
but
he
knew
that
he
had
miserably
failed
when
he
heard
her
falter
of
course
dear
i
i
have
got
it
nearly
perfected
yet
it
be
much
better
but
it
s
sic
fine
now
sweetheart
indeed
it
is
protested
bertram
hurriedly
well
of
course
i
glad
if
you
like
it
murmured
billy
but
the
glow
did
not
come
back
to
her
face
chapter
xviii
sugarplums
those
short
december
days
after
bertram
return
from
new
york
were
busy
ones
for
everybody
miss
winthrop
was
not
in
town
to
give
sittings
for
her
portrait
it
is
true
but
her
absence
only
afforded
bertram
time
and
opportunity
to
attend
to
other
work
that
had
been
more
or
less
delayed
and
neglected
he
was
often
at
hillside
however
and
the
lovers
managed
to
snatch
many
an
hour
of
quiet
happiness
from
the
rush
and
confusion
of
the
christmas
preparations
bertram
was
assuring
himself
now
that
his
jealous
fears
of
arkwright
were
groundless
billy
seldom
mentioned
the
man
and
as
the
days
passed
she
spoke
only
once
of
his
being
at
the
house
the
song
too
she
said
little
of
and
bertram
though
he
was
ashamed
to
own
it
to
himself
breathed
more
freely
the
real
facts
of
the
case
were
that
billy
had
told
arkwright
that
she
should
have
no
time
to
give
attention
to
the
song
until
after
christmas
and
her
manner
had
so
plainly
shown
him
that
she
considered
himself
synonymous
with
the
song
that
he
had
reluctantly
taken
the
hint
and
kept
away
i
make
her
care
for
me
sometime
for
something
besides
a
song
he
told
himself
with
fierce
consolation
but
billy
did
not
know
this
aside
from
bertram
christmas
filled
all
of
billy
thoughts
these
days
there
were
such
a
lot
of
things
she
wished
to
do
but
after
all
they
only
sugarplums
you
know
that
i
giving
dear
she
declared
to
bertram
one
day
when
he
had
remonstrated
with
with
her
for
so
taxing
her
time
and
strength
i
ca
really
do
much
scoffed
bertram
but
it
is
much
honestly
compared
to
what
there
is
to
do
argued
billy
you
see
dear
it
just
this
she
went
on
her
bright
face
sobering
a
little
there
are
such
a
lot
of
people
in
the
world
who
are
really
poor
that
is
they
have
bread
and
probably
meat
to
eat
and
enough
clothes
to
keep
them
warm
but
when
you
said
that
said
it
all
books
music
fun
and
frosting
on
their
cake
they
know
nothing
about
except
to
long
for
but
there
are
the
churches
and
the
charities
and
all
those
societies
i
thought
that
was
what
they
were
for
declared
bertram
still
a
little
aggrievedly
his
worried
eyes
on
billy
tired
face
oh
but
the
churches
and
charities
do
frost
cakes
nor
give
sugarplums
smiled
billy
and
it
right
that
they
should
too
she
added
quickly
they
have
more
than
they
can
do
now
with
the
roast
beef
and
coal
and
flannel
petticoats
that
are
really
and
so
it
just
frosting
and
sugarplums
is
it
these
books
and
magazines
and
concert
tickets
and
lace
collars
for
the
crippled
boy
the
spinster
lady
the
little
widow
and
all
the
rest
of
those
people
who
were
here
last
summer
billy
turned
in
confused
surprise
why
bertram
however
in
the
world
did
you
find
out
about
all
that
i
did
i
just
guessed
it
and
it
seems
boy
guessed
right
the
very
first
time
laughed
bertram
teasingly
but
with
a
tender
light
in
his
eyes
oh
and
i
suppose
you
be
sending
a
frosted
cake
to
the
lowestoft
lady
too
eh
billy
chin
rose
to
a
defiant
stubbornness
i
going
to
try
to
if
i
can
find
out
what
kind
of
frosting
she
how
about
the
alice
lady
or
perhaps
i
should
say
the
lady
alice
smiled
the
man
billy
relaxed
visibly
yes
i
know
she
sighed
there
is
the
lady
alice
but
anyhow
she
ca
call
a
christmas
present
not
if
it
only
a
little
bit
of
frosting
billy
chin
came
up
again
and
you
going
to
really
dare
to
send
her
something
yes
avowed
billy
i
going
down
there
one
of
these
days
in
the
morning
you
going
down
there
billy
not
alone
yes
why
not
but
dearie
you
must
it
was
a
horrid
place
will
so
it
was
horrid
to
live
in
it
was
everything
that
was
cheap
and
mean
and
forlorn
but
it
was
quiet
and
respectable
is
as
if
i
know
the
way
bertram
and
i
sure
that
where
that
poor
crippled
woman
and
daughter
are
safe
i
shall
be
greggory
is
a
lady
bertram
and
i
sure
and
that
the
pity
of
it
to
have
to
live
in
a
place
like
that
they
have
seen
better
days
i
know
those
pitiful
little
worn
crutches
of
hers
were
mahogany
i
sure
bertram
and
they
were
silver
bertram
made
a
restless
movement
i
know
dear
but
if
you
had
some
one
with
you
it
would
do
for
will
of
course
nor
me
under
the
circumstances
but
there
aunt
hannah
he
paused
hopefully
billy
chuckled
bless
your
dear
heart
aunt
hannah
would
call
for
a
dozen
shawls
in
that
place
if
she
had
breath
enough
to
call
for
any
after
she
got
to
the
top
of
those
four
flights
yes
i
suppose
so
rejoined
bertram
with
an
unwilling
smile
still
well
you
take
rosa
he
concluded
decisively
how
miss
alice
would
like
that
to
catch
me
going
with
my
maid
cried
billy
righteous
indignation
in
her
voice
honestly
bertram
i
think
even
gentle
greggory
would
stand
for
then
leave
rosa
outside
in
the
hall
planned
bertram
promptly
and
after
a
few
more
arguments
billy
finally
agreed
to
this
it
was
with
rosa
therefore
that
she
set
out
the
next
morning
for
the
little
room
up
four
flights
on
the
narrow
west
end
street
leaving
the
maid
on
the
top
stair
of
the
fourth
flight
billy
tapped
at
greggory
door
to
her
joy
greggory
herself
answered
the
knock
oh
why
why
good
morning
murmured
the
lady
in
evident
embarrassment
wo
you
come
m
thank
you
may
i
just
a
minute
smiled
billy
brightly
as
she
entered
the
room
billy
threw
a
hasty
look
about
her
there
was
no
one
but
themselves
present
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
therefore
the
girl
took
the
chair
greggory
offered
and
began
to
speak
i
was
down
this
way
that
is
i
came
this
way
this
morning
she
began
a
little
hastily
and
i
wanted
just
to
come
up
and
tell
you
how
sorry
i
was
about
about
that
teapot
the
other
day
we
did
want
it
of
course
if
you
did
want
us
to
have
a
swift
change
crossed
greggory
perturbed
face
oh
then
you
did
come
for
it
again
she
said
i
so
glad
i
did
want
to
refuse
indeed
i
did
come
for
it
and
we
again
do
worry
about
that
greggory
sighed
i
afraid
you
thought
me
very
rude
and
and
impossible
the
other
day
she
stammered
and
please
let
me
take
this
opportunity
right
now
to
apologize
for
my
daughter
she
was
overwrought
and
excited
she
know
what
she
was
saying
or
doing
i
sure
she
was
ashamed
i
think
after
you
billy
raised
a
quick
hand
of
protest
do
please
do
greggory
she
begged
but
it
was
our
fault
that
you
came
we
you
to
come
through
harlow
rejoined
the
other
hurriedly
and
henshaw
was
that
his
name
was
so
kind
in
every
way
i
glad
of
this
chance
to
tell
you
how
much
we
really
did
appreciate
it
and
offer
too
which
we
could
not
of
course
accept
she
finished
the
bright
color
flooding
her
delicate
face
again
billy
raised
a
protesting
hand
but
the
little
woman
in
the
opposite
chair
hurried
on
there
was
still
more
evidently
that
she
wished
to
say
i
hope
henshaw
did
not
feel
too
disappointed
about
the
lowestoft
we
did
want
to
let
it
go
if
we
could
help
it
and
we
hope
now
to
keep
of
course
murmured
billy
sympathetically
my
daughter
knew
you
see
how
much
i
have
always
thought
of
it
and
she
was
determined
that
i
should
not
give
it
up
she
said
i
should
have
that
much
left
anyway
you
see
my
daughter
is
very
unreconciled
still
to
things
as
they
are
and
no
wonder
perhaps
they
are
so
different
from
what
they
were
her
voice
broke
a
little
of
course
said
billy
again
and
this
time
the
words
were
tinged
with
impatient
indignation
if
only
there
were
something
one
could
do
to
help
thank
you
my
dear
but
there
is
indeed
there
is
rejoined
the
other
quickly
and
billy
looking
into
the
proudly
lifted
face
realized
suddenly
that
daughter
alice
had
perhaps
inherited
some
traits
from
mother
we
shall
get
along
very
well
i
am
sure
my
daughter
has
still
another
pupil
she
will
be
home
soon
to
tell
you
herself
billy
rose
with
a
haste
so
marked
it
was
almost
impolite
as
she
murmured
will
she
i
afraid
though
that
i
see
her
after
all
for
i
must
go
and
may
i
leave
these
please
she
added
hurriedly
unpinning
the
bunch
of
white
carnations
from
her
coat
it
seems
a
pity
to
let
them
wilt
when
you
can
put
them
in
water
right
her
studiously
casual
voice
gave
no
hint
that
those
particular
pinks
had
been
bought
less
than
half
an
hour
before
of
a
park
street
florist
so
that
greggory
put
them
in
water
right
there
oh
oh
how
lovely
breathed
greggory
her
face
deep
in
the
feathery
bed
of
sweetness
before
she
could
half
say
thank
you
however
she
found
herself
alone
chapter

alice
greggory
christmas
came
and
went
and
in
a
flurry
of
snow
and
sleet
january
arrived
the
holidays
over
matters
and
things
seemed
to
settle
down
to
the
winter
routine
miss
winthrop
had
prolonged
her
visit
in
washington
until
after
christmas
but
she
had
returned
to
boston
now
and
with
her
she
had
brought
a
idea
for
her
portrait
an
idea
that
caused
her
to
sweep
aside
with
superb
disdain
all
poses
and
costumes
and
sketches
to
date
and
announce
herself
with
disarming
winsomeness
as
all
ready
now
to
really
begin
bertram
henshaw
was
vexed
but
helpless
decidedly
he
wished
to
paint
miss
marguerite
winthrop
portrait
but
to
attempt
to
paint
it
when
all
matters
were
not
to
the
lady
liking
were
worse
than
useless
unless
he
wished
to
hang
this
portrait
in
the
gallery
of
failures
along
with
anderson
and
fullam
and
that
was
not
the
goal
he
had
set
for
it
as
to
the
sordid
money
part
of
the
affair
the
great
winthrop
himself
had
come
to
the
artist
and
in
one
terse
sentence
had
doubled
the
original
price
and
expressed
himself
as
hopeful
that
henshaw
would
put
up
with
the
child
it
was
the
old
financier
next
sentence
however
that
put
the
zest
of
real
determination
into
bertram
for
because
of
it
the
artist
saw
what
this
portrait
was
going
to
mean
to
the
stern
old
man
and
how
dear
was
the
original
of
it
to
a
heart
that
was
commonly
reported
on
the
street
to
be
made
of
stone
obviously
then
indeed
there
was
nothing
for
bertram
henshaw
to
do
but
to
begin
the
new
portrait
and
he
began
it
though
still
it
must
be
confessed
with
inward
questionings
before
a
week
had
passed
however
every
trace
of
irritation
had
fled
and
he
was
once
again
the
absorbed
artist
who
sees
the
vision
of
his
desire
taking
palpable
shape
at
the
end
of
his
brush
it
all
right
he
said
to
billy
then
one
evening
i
glad
she
changed
it
going
to
be
the
best
the
very
best
thing
i
ever
done
i
think
by
the
i
so
glad
exclaimed
billy
i
so
glad
the
repetition
was
so
vehement
that
it
sounded
almost
as
if
she
were
trying
to
convince
herself
as
well
as
bertram
of
something
that
was
not
true
but
it
was
true
billy
told
herself
very
indignantly
that
it
was
indeed
it
was
yet
the
very
fact
that
she
had
to
tell
herself
this
caused
her
to
know
how
perilously
near
she
was
to
being
actually
jealous
of
that
portrait
of
marguerite
winthrop
and
it
shamed
her
very
sternly
these
days
billy
reminded
herself
of
what
kate
had
said
about
bertram
belonging
first
to
his
art
she
thought
with
mortification
too
that
it
look
as
if
she
were
not
the
proper
wife
for
an
artist
if
she
were
going
to
feel
like
this
always
very
resolutely
then
billy
turned
to
her
music
this
was
all
the
more
easily
done
for
not
only
did
she
have
her
usual
concerts
and
the
opera
to
enjoy
but
she
had
become
interested
in
an
operetta
her
club
was
about
to
give
also
she
had
taken
up
the
new
song
again
christmas
being
over
arkwright
had
been
to
the
house
several
times
he
had
changed
some
of
the
words
and
she
had
improved
the
melody
the
work
on
the
accompaniment
was
progressing
finely
now
and
billy
was
so
glad
when
she
was
absorbed
in
her
music
she
forgot
sometimes
that
she
was
ever
so
unfit
an
artist
sweetheart
as
to
be
jealous
of
a
portrait
it
was
quite
early
in
the
month
that
the
usually
expected
january
thaw
came
and
it
was
on
a
comparatively
mild
friday
at
this
time
that
a
matter
of
business
took
billy
into
the
neighborhood
of
symphony
hall
at
about
eleven
in
the
morning
dismissing
john
and
the
car
upon
her
arrival
she
said
that
she
would
later
walk
to
the
home
of
a
friend
near
by
where
she
would
remain
until
it
was
time
for
the
symphony
concert
this
friend
was
a
girl
whom
billy
had
known
at
school
she
was
studying
now
at
the
conservatory
of
music
and
she
had
often
urged
billy
to
come
and
have
luncheon
with
her
in
her
tiny
apartment
which
she
shared
with
three
other
girls
and
a
widowed
aunt
for
housekeeper
on
this
particular
friday
it
had
occurred
to
billy
that
owing
to
her
business
appointment
at
eleven
and
the
symphony
concert
at
two
the
intervening
time
would
give
her
just
the
opportunity
she
had
been
seeking
to
enable
her
to
accept
her
friend
invitation
a
question
asked
and
enthusiastically
answered
in
the
affirmative
over
the
telephone
that
morning
therefore
had
speedily
completed
arrangements
and
she
had
agreed
to
be
at
her
friend
door
by
twelve
or
before
as
it
happened
business
did
not
take
quite
so
long
as
she
had
expected
and
eleven
found
her
well
on
her
way
to
miss
henderson
home
in
spite
of
the
warm
sunshine
and
the
slushy
snow
in
the
streets
there
was
a
cold
raw
wind
and
billy
was
beginning
to
feel
thankful
that
she
had
not
far
to
go
when
she
rounded
a
corner
and
came
upon
a
long
line
of
humanity
that
curved
itself
back
and
forth
on
the
wide
expanse
of
steps
before
symphony
hall
and
then
stretched
itself
far
up
the
avenue
why
what
she
began
under
her
breath
then
suddenly
she
understood
it
was
friday
a
pianist
was
to
play
with
the
symphony
orchestra
that
afternoon
this
must
be
the
line
of
patient
waiters
for
the
balcony
seats
that
arkwright
had
told
about
with
sympathetic
interested
eyes
then
billy
stepped
one
side
to
watch
the
line
for
a
moment
almost
at
once
two
girls
brushed
by
her
and
one
was
saying
what
a
shame
and
after
all
our
struggles
to
get
here
if
only
we
had
lost
that
other
train
we
too
late
you
no
need
to
hurry
the
other
wailed
shrilly
to
a
third
girl
who
was
hastening
toward
them
the
line
is
beyond
the
children
hospital
and
around
the
corner
now
and
the
ones
there
get
in
at
the
look
of
tragic
disappointment
that
crossed
the
third
girl
face
billy
heart
ached
her
first
impulse
of
course
was
to
pull
her
own
symphony
ticket
from
her
muff
and
hurry
forward
with
a
here
take
mine
but
that
hardly
do
she
knew
though
she
would
like
to
see
aunt
hannah
aghast
face
if
this
girl
in
the
red
sweater
and
white
should
suddenly
emerge
from
among
the
sumptuous
satins
and
furs
and
plumes
that
afternoon
and
claim
the
adjacent
orchestra
chair
but
it
was
out
of
the
question
of
course
there
was
only
one
seat
and
there
were
three
girls
besides
all
those
others
with
a
sigh
then
billy
turned
her
eyes
back
to
those
others
those
many
others
that
made
up
the
long
line
stretching
its
weary
length
up
the
avenue
there
were
more
women
than
men
yet
the
men
were
there
jolly
young
men
who
were
plainly
students
older
men
whose
refined
faces
and
threadbare
overcoats
hinted
at
cultured
minds
and
starved
bodies
other
men
who
showed
no
hollows
in
their
cheeks
nor
in
their
garments
it
seemed
to
billy
that
women
of
almost
all
sorts
were
there
young
old
and
students
in
tailored
suits
widows
in
crape
and
veil
girls
that
were
members
of
a
merry
party
women
that
were
plainly
forlorn
and
alone
some
in
the
line
shuffled
restlessly
some
stood
rigidly
quiet
one
had
brought
a
camp
stool
many
were
seated
on
the
steps
beyond
where
the
line
passed
an
open
lot
a
wooden
fence
afforded
a
convenient
prop
one
read
a
book
another
a
paper
three
were
studying
what
was
probably
the
score
of
the
symphony
or
of
the
concerto
they
expected
to
hear
that
afternoon
a
few
did
not
appear
to
mind
the
biting
wind
but
most
of
them
by
or
bent
heads
testified
to
the
contrary
not
far
from
billy
a
woman
nibbled
a
sandwich
furtively
while
beyond
her
a
group
of
girls
were
hilariously
merry
over
four
triangles
of
pie
which
they
held
up
where
all
might
see
many
of
the
faces
were
youthful
happy
and
alert
with
anticipation
but
others
carried
a
wistfulness
and
a
weariness
that
made
billy
heart
ache
her
eyes
indeed
filled
with
quick
tears
later
she
turned
to
go
and
it
was
then
that
she
saw
in
the
line
a
face
that
she
knew
a
face
that
drooped
with
such
a
white
misery
of
spent
strength
that
she
hurried
straight
toward
it
with
a
low
cry
miss
greggory
she
exclaimed
when
she
reached
the
girl
you
look
actually
are
you
ill
for
a
brief
second
only
dazed
questioning
stared
from
the
eyes
billy
knew
when
the
recognition
came
for
she
saw
the
painful
color
stain
the
white
face
red
thank
you
no
i
am
not
ill
miss
neilson
said
the
girl
coldly
but
you
look
so
tired
out
i
have
been
standing
here
some
time
that
is
billy
threw
a
hurried
glance
down
the
line
that
she
knew
had
formed
since
the
girl
two
tired
feet
had
taken
their
first
position
but
you
must
have
come
so
early
it
is
twelve
yet
she
faltered
a
slight
smile
curved
alice
greggory
lips
yes
it
was
early
she
rejoined
a
little
bitterly
but
it
had
to
be
you
know
i
wanted
to
hear
the
music
and
with
this
soloist
and
this
weather
i
knew
that
many
others
would
want
to
hear
the
music
but
you
look
so
white
how
much
longer
when
will
they
let
you
in
demanded
billy
raising
indignant
eyes
to
the
huge
building
before
her
much
as
if
she
would
pull
down
the
walls
if
she
could
and
make
way
for
this
tired
girl
at
her
side
miss
greggory
thin
shoulders
rose
and
fell
in
an
expressive
shrug
billy
gave
a
dismayed
cry
one
almost
two
hours
more
but
miss
greggory
you
ca
how
can
you
stand
it
till
then
you
shivered
three
times
since
i
came
and
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
faint
miss
greggory
shook
her
head
it
is
nothing
really
she
insisted
i
am
quite
well
it
is
only
i
did
happen
to
feel
like
eating
much
breakfast
this
morning
and
that
with
no
luncheon
she
let
a
gesture
finish
her
sentence
no
luncheon
why
oh
you
could
leave
your
place
of
course
frowned
billy
no
and
alice
greggory
lifted
her
head
a
little
proudly
i
do
not
care
to
eat
her
scornful
eyes
were
on
one
of
the
pieces
of
pie
down
the
line
no
longer
a
triangle
of
course
not
agreed
billy
promptly
she
paused
frowned
and
bit
her
lip
suddenly
her
face
cleared
there
the
very
thing
she
exulted
you
shall
have
my
ticket
this
afternoon
miss
greggory
then
you
wo
have
to
stay
here
another
minute
meanwhile
there
is
an
excellent
restaurant
thank
you
no
i
could
do
that
cut
in
the
other
sharply
but
in
a
low
voice
but
you
take
my
ticket
begged
billy
miss
greggory
shook
her
head
certainly
but
i
want
you
to
please
i
shall
be
very
unhappy
if
you
do
grieved
billy
the
other
made
a
peremptory
gesture
should
be
very
unhappy
if
i
did
she
said
with
cold
emphasis
really
miss
neilson
she
went
on
in
a
low
voice
throwing
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
man
ahead
who
was
apparently
absorbed
in
his
newspaper
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
let
me
go
on
in
my
own
way
you
are
very
kind
but
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
nothing
you
were
very
kind
too
of
course
to
send
the
book
and
the
flowers
to
mother
at
christmas
but
never
mind
that
please
interrupted
billy
hurriedly
billy
head
was
lifted
now
her
eyes
were
no
longer
pleading
her
round
little
chin
looked
square
and
determined
if
you
simply
will
not
take
my
ticket
this
afternoon
you
do
this
go
to
some
restaurant
near
here
and
get
a
good
luncheon
something
that
will
sustain
you
i
will
take
your
place
neilson
billy
smiled
radiantly
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
alice
greggory
haughtily
cold
reserve
break
into
anything
like
naturalness
the
astonished
incredulity
of
that
miss
neilson
was
plainly
straight
from
the
heart
so
too
were
the
amazed
words
that
followed
will
stand
certainly
i
will
keep
your
place
do
worry
you
lose
billy
spoke
with
a
smiling
indifference
that
was
meant
to
convey
the
impression
that
standing
in
line
for
a
seat
was
a
daily
habit
of
hers
there
a
restaurant
only
a
little
way
right
down
there
she
finished
and
before
the
dazed
alice
greggory
knew
quite
what
was
happening
she
found
herself
outside
the
line
and
the
other
in
her
place
but
miss
neilson
i
ca
you
must
she
stammered
then
because
of
something
in
the
unyieldingness
of
the
square
young
chin
above
the
sealskin
coat
and
because
she
could
not
she
knew
use
actual
force
to
drag
the
owner
of
that
chin
out
of
the
line
she
bowed
her
head
in
acquiescence
well
then
i
will
long
enough
for
some
coffee
and
maybe
a
sandwich
and
thank
you
she
choked
as
she
turned
and
hurried
away
billy
drew
the
deep
breath
of
one
who
has
triumphed
after
long
struggles
but
the
breath
broke
off
short
in
a
gasp
of
dismay
coming
straight
up
the
avenue
toward
her
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
billy
wished
least
to
see
at
that
moment
bertram
henshaw
billy
remembered
then
that
she
had
twice
lately
heard
her
lover
speak
of
calling
at
the
boston
opera
house
concerning
a
commission
to
paint
an
ideal
head
to
represent
music
for
some
decorative
purpose
the
opera
house
was
only
a
short
distance
up
the
avenue
doubtless
he
was
on
his
way
there
now
he
was
very
near
by
this
time
and
billy
held
her
breath
suspended
there
was
a
chance
of
course
that
he
might
not
notice
her
and
billy
was
counting
on
that
chance
until
a
gust
of
wind
whirled
a
loose
of
newspaper
from
the
hands
of
the
man
in
front
of
her
and
naturally
attracted
bertram
eyes
to
its
vicinity
and
to
hers
the
next
moment
he
was
at
her
side
and
his
dumfounded
but
was
in
her
ears
billy
bubbled
into
low
laughter
there
were
such
a
lot
of
funny
situations
in
the
world
and
of
them
all
this
one
was
about
the
drollest
she
thought
yes
i
know
she
gurgled
you
do
have
to
say
face
is
saying
even
more
than
your
tongue
this
is
just
for
a
girl
i
know
i
keeping
her
bertram
frowned
he
looked
as
if
he
were
meditating
picking
billy
up
and
walking
off
with
her
but
billy
he
protested
just
above
his
breath
this
is
sugarplums
nor
frosting
it
plain
suicide
standing
out
in
this
wind
like
this
besides
he
stopped
with
an
angrily
despairing
glance
at
her
surroundings
yes
i
know
she
nodded
a
little
soberly
understanding
the
look
and
answering
that
first
it
is
pleasant
nor
comfortable
in
lots
of
ways
but
had
it
all
the
morning
as
for
the
cold
i
as
warm
as
toast
it
wo
be
long
anyway
she
just
gone
to
get
something
to
eat
then
i
going
to
may
henderson
for
bertram
sighed
impatiently
and
opened
his
lips
only
to
close
them
with
the
words
unsaid
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
and
he
had
already
said
too
much
he
thought
with
a
savage
glance
at
the
man
ahead
who
still
had
enough
of
his
paper
left
to
serve
for
a
pretence
at
reading
as
bertram
could
see
however
the
man
was
not
reading
a
word
he
was
too
acutely
conscious
of
the
handsome
young
woman
in
the
long
sealskin
coat
behind
him
billy
was
already
the
cynosure
of
dozens
of
eyes
and
bertram
knew
that
his
own
arrival
on
the
scene
had
not
lessened
the
interest
of
the
owners
of
those
eyes
he
only
hoped
devoutly
that
no
one
in
the
line
knew
him
ar
billy
and
that
no
one
quite
knew
what
had
happened
he
did
not
wish
to
see
himself
and
his
fiancée
the
subject
of
headlines
in
some
evening
paper
figuring
as
talented
young
composer
and
her
famous
artist
lover
take
poor
place
in
a
ticket
he
shivered
at
the
thought
are
you
cold
worried
billy
if
you
are
do
stand
here
please
he
shook
his
head
silently
his
eyes
were
searching
the
street
for
the
only
one
whose
coming
could
bring
him
relief
it
must
have
been
but
a
luncheon
for
the
girl
for
soon
she
came
the
man
surmised
that
it
was
she
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
and
stepped
back
at
once
he
had
no
wish
for
introductions
a
moment
later
the
girl
was
in
billy
place
and
billy
herself
was
at
his
side
that
was
alice
greggory
bertram
she
told
him
as
they
walked
on
swiftly
and
bertram
she
was
actually
almost
when
she
took
my
humph
well
i
should
think
she
better
be
growled
bertram
perversely
pooh
it
did
hurt
me
any
dearie
laughed
billy
with
a
conciliatory
pat
on
his
arm
as
they
turned
down
the
street
upon
which
her
friend
lived
and
now
can
you
come
in
and
see
may
a
minute
i
afraid
not
regretted
bertram
i
wish
i
could
but
i
busier
than
busy
and
i
was
to
be
already
late
when
i
saw
you
jove
billy
i
just
could
believe
my
eyes
you
looked
it
twinkled
billy
it
was
worth
a
farm
just
to
see
your
face
i
want
the
farm
if
i
was
going
through
that
again
retorted
the
man
grimly
bertram
was
still
seeing
that
newspaper
heading
but
billy
only
laughed
again
chapter
xx
arkwright
tells
a
story
arkwright
called
monday
afternoon
by
appointment
and
together
he
and
billy
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
new
song
it
was
when
with
aunt
hannah
they
were
having
tea
before
the
fire
a
little
later
that
billy
told
of
her
adventure
the
preceding
friday
afternoon
in
front
of
symphony
hall
you
knew
the
girl
of
course
i
think
you
said
you
knew
the
girl
ventured
arkwright
oh
yes
she
was
alice
greggory
i
met
her
with
uncle
william
first
over
a
lowestoft
teapot
maybe
you
like
to
know
i
met
her
smiled
billy
alice
greggory
arkwright
eyes
showed
a
sudden
interest
i
used
to
know
an
alice
greggory
but
it
is
the
same
one
probably
her
mother
was
a
billy
gave
a
little
cry
why
it
is
it
must
be
alice
greggory
mother
is
a
cripple
oh
do
you
know
them
really
well
it
does
look
like
it
rejoined
arkwright
showing
even
deeper
interest
i
have
seen
them
for
four
or
five
years
they
used
to
live
in
our
town
the
mother
was
a
little
woman
with
young
eyes
and
prematurely
white
that
describes
my
greggory
exactly
cried
billy
eager
voice
and
the
daughter
alice
why
as
i
said
it
been
four
years
since
i
seen
a
touch
of
constraint
had
come
into
arkwright
voice
which
billy
keen
ear
was
quick
to
detect
she
was
nineteen
then
and
very
about
my
height
and
with
hair
and
big
eyes
that
look
steely
cold
when
she
angry
questioned
billy
i
reckon
that
about
it
acknowledged
the
man
with
a
faint
smile
then
they
the
ones
declared
the
girl
plainly
excited
that
splendid
now
we
can
know
them
and
perhaps
do
something
for
them
i
love
that
dear
little
mother
already
and
i
think
i
should
the
daughter
if
she
did
put
out
so
many
prickers
that
i
could
get
near
her
but
tell
us
about
them
how
did
they
come
here
why
did
you
know
they
were
here
are
you
good
at
answering
a
dozen
questions
at
once
asked
aunt
hannah
turning
smiling
eyes
from
billy
to
the
man
at
her
side
well
i
can
try
he
offered
to
begin
with
they
are
judge
widow
and
daughter
they
belong
to
fine
families
on
both
sides
and
they
used
to
be
well
off
really
wealthy
for
a
small
town
but
the
judge
was
better
at
than
he
was
at
and
when
he
came
to
die
his
income
stopped
of
course
and
his
estate
was
found
to
be
in
bad
shape
through
reckless
loans
and
worthless
investments
that
was
eight
years
ago
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
then
until
there
was
almost
nothing
i
knew
there
was
some
such
story
as
that
back
of
them
declared
billy
but
how
do
you
suppose
they
came
here
to
get
away
from
everybody
i
suspect
replied
arkwright
that
would
be
like
them
they
were
very
proud
and
it
is
easy
you
know
to
be
nobody
where
you
been
somebody
it
does
hurt
quite
so
hard
to
be
nobody
where
you
never
been
anything
but
i
suppose
so
sighed
billy
still
they
must
have
had
they
did
of
course
but
when
the
love
of
one
friends
becomes
highly
seasoned
with
pity
it
does
make
a
pleasant
morsel
to
swallow
specially
if
you
do
like
the
taste
of
the
pity
and
there
are
people
who
do
you
know
the
greggorys
were
that
kind
they
were
morbidly
so
from
their
cheap
little
cottage
where
they
did
their
own
work
they
stepped
out
in
their
shabby
garments
and
hats
with
heads
even
more
proudly
erect
than
in
the
old
days
when
their
home
and
their
gowns
and
their
doings
were
the
admiration
and
envy
of
the
town
you
see
they
did
want
that
i
see
cried
billy
her
face
aglow
with
sudden
understanding
and
i
do
believe
pity
would
be
nice
her
own
chin
was
held
high
as
she
spoke
it
must
have
been
hard
indeed
murmured
aunt
hannah
with
a
sigh
as
she
set
down
her
teacup
it
was
nodded
arkwright
of
course
greggory
with
her
crippled
foot
could
do
nothing
to
bring
in
any
money
except
to
sew
a
little
it
all
depended
on
alice
and
when
matters
got
to
their
worst
she
began
to
teach
she
was
fond
of
music
and
could
play
the
piano
well
and
of
course
she
had
had
the
best
instruction
she
could
get
from
city
teachers
only
twenty
miles
away
from
our
home
town
young
as
she
was
about
seventeen
when
she
began
to
teach
i
think
she
got
a
few
beginners
right
away
and
in
two
years
she
had
worked
up
quite
a
class
meanwhile
keeping
on
with
her
own
studies
herself
they
might
have
carried
the
thing
through
maybe
continued
arkwright
and
never
known
that
the
existed
if
it
had
been
for
some
ugly
rumors
that
suddenly
arose
attacking
the
judge
honesty
in
an
old
matter
that
somebody
raked
up
that
was
too
much
under
this
last
straw
their
courage
broke
utterly
alice
dismissed
every
pupil
sold
almost
all
their
remaining
goods
they
had
lots
of
quite
valuable
heirlooms
i
suspect
that
where
your
lowestoft
teapot
came
in
and
with
the
money
thus
gained
they
left
town
until
they
could
go
they
scarcely
showed
themselves
once
on
the
street
they
were
never
at
home
to
callers
and
they
left
without
telling
one
soul
where
they
were
going
so
far
as
we
could
ever
why
the
poor
dears
cried
billy
how
they
must
have
suffered
but
things
will
be
different
now
you
go
to
see
them
of
course
and
at
the
look
that
came
into
arkwright
face
she
stopped
in
surprise
you
forget
they
would
wish
to
see
me
demurred
the
man
and
again
billy
noticed
the
odd
constraint
in
his
voice
but
they
would
mind
argued
billy
i
afraid
they
would
in
fact
i
sure
they
refuse
entirely
to
see
billy
eyes
grew
determined
but
they
ca
refuse
if
i
bring
about
a
meeting
just
casually
you
know
she
challenged
arkwright
laughed
well
i
wo
pretend
to
say
as
to
the
consequences
of
that
he
rejoined
rising
to
his
feet
but
they
might
be
disastrous
was
it
you
yourself
who
were
telling
me
a
few
minutes
ago
how
steely
cold
miss
alice
eyes
got
when
she
was
angry
billy
knew
by
the
way
the
man
spoke
that
for
some
reason
he
did
not
wish
to
prolong
the
subject
of
his
meeting
the
greggorys
she
made
a
quick
shift
therefore
to
another
phase
of
the
matter
but
tell
me
please
before
you
go
how
did
those
rumors
come
out
about
judge
greggory
honesty
i
mean
why
i
never
knew
exactly
frowned
arkwright
musingly
yet
it
seems
too
that
mother
did
say
in
one
letter
while
i
was
in
paris
that
some
of
the
accusations
had
been
found
to
be
false
and
that
there
was
a
prospect
that
the
judge
good
name
might
be
saved
after
oh
i
wish
it
might
sighed
billy
think
what
it
would
mean
to
those
women
mean
everything
cried
arkwright
warmly
and
i
write
to
mother
i
will
and
find
out
just
what
there
is
to
anything
then
you
can
tell
them
he
finished
a
little
stiffly
yes
or
you
nodded
billy
lightly
and
because
she
began
at
once
to
speak
of
something
else
the
first
part
of
her
sentence
passed
without
comment
the
door
had
scarcely
closed
behind
arkwright
when
billy
turned
to
aunt
hannah
a
beaming
face
aunt
hannah
did
you
notice
she
cried
how
mary
jane
looked
and
acted
whenever
alice
greggory
was
spoken
of
there
was
something
between
them
i
sure
there
was
and
they
quarrelled
why
no
dear
i
did
see
anything
unusual
murmured
the
elder
lady
well
i
did
and
i
going
to
be
the
fairy
godmother
that
straightens
everything
all
out
too
see
if
i
not
they
make
a
splendid
couple
aunt
hannah
i
going
right
down
there
billy
my
dear
exclaimed
the
more
conservative
old
lady
you
taking
things
a
little
too
much
for
granted
maybe
they
do
wish
for
for
a
fairy
godmother
oh
wo
know
i
a
fairy
godmother
not
one
of
them
and
of
course
i
would
mention
even
a
hint
to
anybody
laughed
billy
just
going
down
to
get
acquainted
with
the
greggorys
that
all
only
think
aunt
hannah
what
they
must
have
suffered
and
look
at
the
place
they
living
in
now
gentlewomen
like
them
yes
yes
poor
things
poor
things
sighed
aunt
hannah
i
hope
i
find
out
that
she
really
good
at
teaching
i
mean
the
daughter
resumed
billy
after
a
moment
pause
if
she
is
one
thing
i
can
do
to
help
anyhow
i
can
get
some
of
marie
old
pupils
for
her
i
some
of
them
have
begun
with
a
new
teacher
yet
and
carleton
told
me
last
friday
that
neither
she
nor
her
sister
was
at
all
satisfied
with
the
one
their
girls
taken
change
i
know
in
a
minute
at
my
recommendation
that
is
of
course
if
i
can
the
recommendation
continued
billy
with
a
troubled
frown
anyhow
i
going
down
to

a
matter
of
straight
business
true
to
her
assertion
billy
went
down
to
the
greggorys
the
next
day
this
time
she
did
not
take
rosa
with
her
even
aunt
hannah
conceded
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
she
had
not
been
gone
ten
minutes
however
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
and
rosa
came
to
say
that
bertram
henshaw
wanted
to
speak
with
stetson
rosa
says
that
billy
not
there
called
bertram
aggrieved
voice
when
aunt
hannah
had
said
good
morning
my
dear
me
no
bertram
she
in
a
fever
of
excitement
this
morning
she
probably
tell
you
all
about
it
when
you
come
out
here
you
coming
out
are
you
yes
oh
yes
but
what
is
it
where
she
gone
aunt
hannah
laughed
softly
well
she
gone
down
to
the
the
greggorys
what
again
oh
you
might
as
well
get
used
to
it
bertram
bantered
aunt
hannah
for
there
be
a
good
many
i
why
aunt
hannah
what
do
you
mean
bertram
voice
was
not
quite
pleased
oh
she
tell
you
it
only
that
the
greggorys
have
turned
out
to
be
old
friends
of
of
arkwright
bertram
voice
was
decidedly
displeased
now
yes
and
there
quite
a
story
to
it
all
as
well
billy
is
wildly
excited
as
you
know
she
would
be
you
hear
all
about
it
of
yes
of
course
echoed
bertram
but
there
was
no
ring
of
enthusiasm
in
his
voice
neither
then
nor
when
he
said
a
moment
later
billy
meanwhile
on
her
way
to
the
greggory
home
was
as
aunt
hannah
had
said
wildly
it
seemed
so
strange
and
wonderful
and
delightful
the
whole
affair
that
she
should
have
found
them
because
of
a
lowestoft
teapot
that
arkwright
should
know
them
and
that
there
should
be
the
chance
now
that
she
might
help
them
in
some
way
though
this
last
she
knew
could
be
accomplished
only
through
the
exercise
of
the
greatest
tact
and
delicacy
she
had
not
forgotten
that
arkwright
had
told
her
of
their
hatred
of
pity
in
the
sober
second
thought
of
the
morning
billy
was
not
sure
now
of
a
possible
romance
in
connection
with
arkwright
and
the
daughter
alice
but
she
had
by
no
means
abandoned
the
idea
and
she
meant
to
keep
her
eyes
open
and
if
there
should
be
a
chance
to
bring
such
a
thing
about
meanwhile
of
course
she
should
not
mention
the
matter
even
to
bertram
just
what
would
be
her
method
of
procedure
this
first
morning
billy
had
not
determined
the
pretty
potted
azalea
in
her
hand
would
be
excuse
for
her
entrance
into
the
room
after
that
circumstances
must
decide
for
themselves
greggory
was
found
to
be
alone
at
home
as
before
and
billy
was
glad
she
would
rather
begin
with
one
than
two
she
thought
the
little
woman
greeted
her
cordially
gave
thanks
for
the
beautiful
plant
and
also
for
billy
kind
thoughtfulness
friday
afternoon
from
that
she
was
very
skilfully
led
to
talk
more
of
the
daughter
and
soon
billy
was
getting
just
the
information
she
wanted
information
concerning
the
character
aims
and
daily
life
of
alice
greggory
you
see
we
have
some
money
a
very
little
explained
greggory
after
a
time
though
to
get
it
we
have
had
to
sell
all
our
treasures
but
the
lowestoft
with
a
quick
glance
into
eyes
we
need
not
perhaps
live
in
quite
so
poor
a
place
but
we
prefer
just
now
to
spend
the
little
money
we
have
for
something
other
than
imitation
comfort
lessons
for
instance
and
an
occasional
concert
my
daughter
is
studying
even
while
she
is
teaching
she
hopes
to
train
herself
for
an
accompanist
and
for
a
teacher
she
does
not
aspire
to
concert
solo
work
she
understands
her
but
she
is
probably
very
good
at
billy
hesitated
a
little
she
is
very
good
she
has
the
best
of
a
little
proudly
greggory
gave
the
names
of
two
boston
pianists
names
that
would
carry
weight
anywhere
unconsciously
billy
relaxed
she
did
not
know
until
that
moment
how
she
had
worried
for
fear
she
could
not
conscientiously
recommend
this
alice
greggory
of
course
resumed
the
mother
alice
pupils
are
few
and
they
pay
low
prices
but
she
is
gaining
she
goes
to
the
houses
of
course
she
herself
practises
two
hours
a
day
at
a
house
up
on
pinckney
street
she
gives
lessons
to
a
little
girl
in
i
see
nodded
billy
brightly
and
i
been
thinking
greggory
maybe
i
know
of
some
pupils
she
could
get
i
have
a
friend
who
has
just
given
hers
up
owing
to
her
marriage
sometime
soon
i
going
to
talk
to
your
daughter
if
i
may
and
and
here
she
is
right
now
interposed
greggory
as
the
door
opened
under
a
hurried
hand
billy
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
she
was
disturbed
and
disappointed
she
did
not
particularly
wish
to
see
alice
greggory
just
then
she
wished
even
less
to
see
her
when
she
noted
the
swift
change
that
came
to
the
girl
face
at
sight
of
herself
oh
morning
miss
neilson
murmured
miss
greggory
with
a
smile
so
forced
that
her
mother
hurriedly
looked
to
the
azalea
in
search
of
a
possible
peacemaker
my
dear
see
she
stammered
what
miss
neilson
has
brought
me
and
it
so
full
of
blossoms
too
and
she
says
it
remain
so
for
a
long
long
time
if
we
only
keep
it
alice
greggory
murmured
a
low
something
a
something
that
she
tried
evidently
very
hard
to
make
politely
appropriate
and
appreciative
yet
her
manner
as
she
took
off
her
hat
and
coat
and
sat
down
so
plainly
said
you
are
very
kind
of
course
but
i
wish
you
would
keep
yourself
and
your
plants
at
home
that
greggory
began
a
hurried
apology
much
as
if
the
words
had
indeed
been
spoken
my
daughter
is
really
ill
this
morning
you
must
mind
that
is
afraid
you
think
you
see
she
took
cold
last
week
a
bad
cold
and
she
is
over
it
yet
finished
the
little
woman
in
painful
embarrassment
of
course
she
took
cold
standing
all
those
hours
in
that
horrid
wind
friday
cried
billy
indignantly
a
quick
red
flew
to
alice
greggory
face
billy
saw
it
at
once
and
fervently
wished
she
had
spoken
of
anything
but
that
friday
afternoon
it
looked
almost
as
if
she
were
them
of
what
she
had
done
that
day
in
her
confusion
and
in
her
anxiety
to
say
something
anything
that
would
get
their
minds
off
that
idea
she
uttered
now
the
first
words
that
came
into
her
head
as
it
happened
they
were
the
last
words
that
sober
second
thought
would
have
told
her
to
say
never
mind
greggory
we
have
her
all
well
and
strong
soon
never
fear
just
wait
till
i
send
peggy
and
mary
jane
to
take
her
out
for
a
drive
one
of
these
mild
sunny
days
you
have
no
idea
how
much
good
it
will
do
her
alice
greggory
got
suddenly
to
her
feet
her
face
was
very
white
now
her
eyes
had
the
steely
coldness
that
billy
knew
so
well
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
low
and
sternly
controlled
miss
neilson
you
will
think
me
rude
of
course
especially
after
your
great
kindness
to
me
the
other
day
but
i
ca
help
it
it
seems
to
me
best
to
speak
now
before
it
goes
any
alice
dear
remonstrated
greggory
extending
a
frightened
hand
the
girl
did
not
turn
her
head
nor
hesitate
but
she
caught
the
extended
hand
and
held
it
warmly
in
both
her
own
with
gentle
little
pats
while
she
went
on
speaking
i
sure
mother
agrees
with
me
that
it
is
best
for
the
present
that
we
keep
quite
to
ourselves
i
can
not
question
your
kindness
of
course
after
your
somewhat
unusual
favor
the
other
day
but
i
am
very
sure
that
your
friends
miss
peggy
and
miss
mary
jane
have
no
real
desire
to
make
my
acquaintance
nor
if
you
pardon
me
have
i
under
the
circumstances
any
wish
to
make
oh
alice
alice
began
the
little
mother
in
dismay
but
a
rippling
laugh
from
their
visitor
brought
an
angry
flush
even
to
her
gentle
face
billy
understood
the
flush
and
struggled
for
please
please
forgive
me
she
choked
but
you
see
you
could
of
course
know
that
mary
jane
and
peggy
are
they
just
a
man
and
an
automobile
an
unwilling
smile
trembled
on
alice
greggory
lips
but
she
still
stood
her
ground
after
all
girls
or
men
and
automobiles
miss
neilson
it
makes
little
difference
they
charity
and
it
not
so
long
that
we
been
objects
of
charity
that
we
quite
really
enjoy
it
there
was
a
moment
hush
billy
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
i
never
even
charity
said
billy
so
gently
that
a
faint
red
stole
into
the
white
cheeks
opposite
for
a
tense
minute
alice
greggory
held
herself
erect
then
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
and
voice
she
released
her
mother
hand
dropped
into
her
own
chair
again
and
said
wearily
i
know
you
did
miss
neilson
it
all
my
foolish
pride
of
course
it
only
that
i
was
thinking
how
dearly
i
would
love
to
meet
girls
again
just
as
but
i
no
longer
have
any
business
with
pride
of
course
i
shall
be
pleased
i
sure
she
went
on
dully
to
accept
anything
you
may
do
for
us
from
automobile
rides
to
to
red
flannel
billy
almost
but
not
quite
laughed
still
the
laugh
would
have
been
near
to
a
sob
had
it
been
given
surprising
as
was
the
quick
transition
in
the
girl
manner
and
absurd
as
was
the
juxtaposition
of
automobiles
and
red
flannel
petticoats
the
white
misery
of
alice
greggory
face
and
the
weary
despair
of
her
attitude
were
tragic
specially
to
one
who
knew
her
story
as
did
billy
neilson
and
it
was
because
billy
did
know
her
story
that
she
did
not
make
the
mistake
now
of
offering
pity
instead
she
said
with
a
bright
smile
and
a
casual
manner
that
gave
no
hint
of
studied
labor
well
as
it
happens
miss
greggory
what
i
want
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
automobiles
or
red
flannel
petticoats
it
a
matter
of
straight
how
billy
blessed
the
thought
that
had
so
suddenly
come
to
her
your
mother
tells
me
you
play
accompaniments
now
a
girls
club
of
which
i
am
a
member
is
getting
up
an
operetta
for
charity
and
we
need
an
accompanist
there
is
no
one
in
the
club
who
is
able
and
at
the
same
time
willing
to
spend
the
amount
of
time
necessary
for
practice
and
rehearsals
so
we
had
decided
to
hire
one
outside
and
i
have
been
given
the
task
of
finding
one
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
you
would
be
willing
to
undertake
it
for
us
would
you
billy
knew
at
once
from
the
quick
change
in
the
other
face
and
manner
that
she
had
taken
exactly
the
right
course
to
relieve
the
strain
of
the
situation
despair
and
lassitude
fell
away
from
alice
greggory
almost
like
a
garment
her
countenance
became
alert
and
interested
indeed
i
would
i
should
be
glad
to
do
good
then
can
you
come
out
to
my
home
sometime
and
go
over
the
music
with
me
rehearsals
will
not
begin
until
next
week
but
i
can
give
you
the
music
and
tell
you
something
of
what
we
are
planning
to
yes
i
could
come
at
ten
in
the
morning
for
an
hour
or
at
three
in
the
afternoon
for
two
hours
or
more
replied
miss
greggory
after
a
moment
hesitation
suppose
we
call
it
in
the
afternoon
then
smiled
billy
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
now
i
must
go
and
here
my
address
she
finished
taking
out
her
card
and
laying
it
on
the
table
near
her
for
reasons
of
her
own
billy
went
away
that
morning
without
saying
anything
more
about
the
proposed
new
pupils
new
pupils
were
not
automobile
rides
nor
petticoats
to
be
sure
but
she
did
not
care
to
risk
disturbing
the
present
interested
happiness
of
alice
face
by
mentioning
anything
that
might
be
construed
as
too
officious
an
assistance
on
the
whole
billy
felt
well
pleased
with
her
morning
work
to
aunt
hannah
upon
her
return
she
expressed
herself
thus
it
splendid
even
better
than
i
hoped
i
shall
have
a
chance
of
course
to
see
for
myself
just
how
well
she
plays
and
all
that
i
pretty
sure
though
from
what
i
hear
that
that
part
will
be
all
right
then
the
operetta
will
give
us
a
chance
to
see
a
good
deal
of
her
and
to
bring
about
a
natural
meeting
between
her
and
mary
jane
oh
aunt
hannah
i
could
have
it
better
and
there
the
whole
thing
just
tumbled
into
my
hands
i
knew
it
had
the
minute
i
remembered
about
the
operetta
you
know
i
chairman
and
they
left
me
to
get
the
accompanist
and
like
a
flash
it
came
to
me
when
i
was
wondering
to
say
or
do
to
get
her
out
of
that
awful
state
she
was
in
her
to
be
your
accompanist
and
i
did
and
i
so
glad
i
did
oh
aunt
hannah
it
coming
out
lovely
i
know
it
chapter

plans
and
plottings
to
billy
alice
greggory
first
visit
to
hillside
was
in
every
way
a
delight
and
a
satisfaction
to
alice
it
was
even
more
than
that
for
the
first
time
in
years
she
found
herself
welcomed
into
a
home
of
wealth
culture
and
refinement
as
an
equal
and
the
frank
cordiality
and
naturalness
of
her
hostess
evident
expectation
of
meeting
a
congenial
companion
was
like
balm
to
a
sensitive
soul
rendered
morbid
by
long
years
of
superciliousness
and
snubbing
no
wonder
that
under
the
cheery
friendliness
of
it
all
alice
cold
reserve
vanished
and
that
in
its
place
came
something
very
like
her
old
ease
and
charm
of
manner
by
the
time
aunt
hannah
according
to
previous
agreement
came
into
the
room
the
two
girls
were
laughing
and
chatting
over
the
operetta
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
for
years
much
to
billy
delight
alice
greggory
as
a
musician
proved
to
be
eminently
satisfactory
she
was
quick
at
sight
reading
and
accurate
she
played
easily
and
with
good
expression
particularly
was
she
a
good
accompanist
possessing
to
a
marked
degree
that
happy
faculty
of
a
singer
which
means
that
she
neither
led
the
way
nor
lagged
behind
being
always
exactly
in
sympathetic
step
than
which
nothing
is
more
to
the
singer
it
was
after
the
music
for
the
operetta
had
been
and
discussed
that
alice
greggory
chanced
to
see
one
of
billy
own
songs
lying
near
her
with
a
pleased
smile
she
picked
it
up
oh
you
know
this
too
she
cried
i
played
it
for
a
lady
only
the
other
day
it
so
pretty
i
think
all
of
hers
are
that
i
have
seen
billy
neilson
is
a
girl
you
know
they
say
in
spite
of
she
stopped
abruptly
her
eyes
grew
wide
and
questioning
miss
neilson
it
be
you
do
mean
is
your
name
it
you
she
finished
joyously
as
the
telltale
color
dyed
billy
face
the
next
moment
her
own
cheeks
burned
scarlet
and
to
think
of
my
letting
stand
in
line
for
a
admission
she
scorned
nonsense
laughed
billy
it
did
hurt
me
any
more
than
it
did
you
come
in
looking
about
for
a
quick
something
to
take
her
attention
billy
eyes
fell
on
the
manuscript
copy
of
her
new
song
bearing
arkwright
name
yielding
to
a
daring
impulse
she
drew
it
hastily
forward
here
a
new
one
a
one
not
even
printed
yet
do
you
think
the
words
are
pretty
she
asked
as
she
had
hoped
alice
greggory
eyes
after
they
had
glanced
through
the
first
page
sought
the
name
at
the
left
side
below
the
title
by
m
there
was
a
visible
start
and
a
pause
before
the
was
uttered
in
a
slightly
different
tone
billy
noted
both
the
start
and
the
pause
and
gloried
in
them
yes
the
words
are
by
arkwright
she
said
with
smooth
unconcern
but
with
a
covert
glance
at
the
other
face
ever
hear
of
him
alice
greggory
gave
a
short
little
laugh
probably
not
this
one
i
used
to
know
an
arkwright
long
ago
but
he
was
a
poet
so
far
as
i
know
she
finished
with
a
little
catch
in
her
breath
that
made
billy
long
to
take
her
into
a
warm
embrace
alice
greggory
turned
then
to
the
music
she
had
much
to
say
of
this
very
much
but
she
had
nothing
more
whatever
to
say
of
arkwright
in
spite
of
the
tempting
conversation
bait
that
billy
dropped
so
freely
after
that
rosa
brought
in
tea
and
toast
and
the
little
frosted
cakes
that
were
always
such
a
favorite
with
billy
guests
then
alice
greggory
said
her
eyes
full
of
tears
that
billy
pretended
not
to
see
there
breathed
billy
as
soon
as
she
had
aunt
hannah
to
herself
again
what
did
i
tell
you
did
you
see
miss
greggory
start
and
blush
and
hear
her
sigh
just
over
the
of
arkwright
just
as
if
now
i
want
them
to
meet
only
it
must
be
casual
aunt
hannah
casual
and
i
rather
wait
till
mary
jane
hears
from
his
mother
if
possible
so
if
there
anything
good
to
tell
the
poor
girl
he
can
tell
yes
of
course
dear
child
i
hope
he
can
murmured
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
had
ceased
now
trying
to
make
billy
refrain
from
the
reprehensible
mary
in
fact
if
the
truth
were
known
aunt
hannah
herself
in
her
thoughts
and
sometimes
in
her
words
called
him
mary
but
indeed
my
dear
i
did
see
anything
stiff
or
or
repelling
about
miss
greggory
as
you
said
there
there
was
smiled
billy
honestly
aunt
hannah
i
should
never
have
known
her
for
the
same
girl
who
showed
me
the
door
that
first
morning
she
finished
merrily
as
she
turned
to
go
it
was
the
next
day
that
cyril
and
marie
came
home
from
their
honeymoon
they
went
directly
to
their
pretty
little
apartment
on
beacon
street
brookline
within
easy
walking
distance
of
billy
own
cozy
home
cyril
intended
to
build
in
a
year
or
two
meanwhile
they
had
a
very
pretty
convenient
home
which
was
according
to
bertram
electrified
to
within
an
inch
of
its
life
and
equipped
with
everything
that
was
fireless
smokeless
dustless
and
in
it
marie
had
a
spotlessly
white
kitchen
where
she
might
make
puddings
to
her
content
marie
had
again
according
to
bertram
a
visiting
acquaintance
with
a
in
other
words
a
stout
woman
was
engaged
to
come
two
days
in
the
week
to
wash
iron
and
scrub
also
to
come
in
each
night
to
wash
the
dinner
dishes
thus
leaving
marie
evenings
free
for
the
shaded
lamp
billy
said
marie
had
not
arrived
at
this
to
her
delightful
arrangement
of
a
visiting
acquaintance
without
some
opposition
from
her
friends
even
billy
had
stood
somewhat
aghast
but
my
dear
wo
it
be
hard
for
you
to
do
so
much
she
argued
one
day
you
know
you
are
very
i
know
but
it
wo
be
hard
as
i
planned
it
replied
marie
specially
when
i
been
longing
for
years
to
do
this
very
thing
why
billy
if
i
had
to
stand
by
and
watch
a
maid
do
all
these
things
i
want
to
do
myself
i
should
feel
just
like
like
a
hungry
man
who
sees
another
man
eating
up
his
dinner
oh
of
course
she
added
plaintively
after
billy
laughter
had
subsided
i
do
it
always
i
expect
to
of
course
when
we
have
a
house
i
not
sure
then
though
that
i
dress
up
the
maid
and
order
her
to
receive
the
calls
and
go
to
the
pink
teas
while
i
make
her
puddings
she
finished
saucily
as
billy
began
to
laugh
again
the
bride
and
groom
as
was
proper
were
soon
after
their
arrival
invited
to
dine
at
both
william
and
billy
then
until
marie
at
homes
should
begin
the
devoted
couple
settled
down
to
quiet
days
by
themselves
with
only
occasional
visits
from
the
family
to
interrupt
interrupt
was
bertram
word
not
marie
though
it
is
safe
to
say
it
was
not
far
different
from
the
one
cyril
used
in
his
thoughts
bertram
himself
these
days
was
more
than
busy
besides
working
on
miss
winthrop
portrait
and
on
two
or
three
other
commissions
he
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
four
pictures
which
he
was
to
show
in
the
exhibition
soon
to
be
held
by
a
prominent
art
club
of
which
he
was
the
acknowledged
star
member
naturally
therefore
his
time
was
well
occupied
naturally
too
billy
knowing
this
lashed
herself
more
sternly
than
ever
into
a
daily
reminder
of
kate
assertion
that
he
belonged
first
to
his
art
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
billy
was
careful
to
see
that
no
engagement
with
herself
should
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
artist
work
and
that
no
word
of
hers
should
attempt
to
keep
him
at
her
side
when
art
called
billy
always
spelled
that
word
now
in
her
mind
with
tall
black
letters
the
way
it
had
sounded
when
it
fell
from
kate
lips
that
these
tactics
on
her
part
were
beginning
to
fill
her
lover
with
vague
alarm
and
a
very
definite
unrest
she
did
not
once
suspect
eagerly
therefore
even
with
conscientious
delight
she
welcomed
the
new
that
arkwright
brought
they
would
give
her
something
else
to
take
up
her
time
and
attention
she
welcomed
them
also
for
another
reason
they
would
bring
arkwright
more
often
to
the
house
and
this
would
of
course
lead
to
that
casual
meeting
between
him
and
alice
greggory
when
the
rehearsals
for
the
operetta
should
commence
which
would
be
very
soon
now
and
billy
did
so
long
to
bring
about
that
meeting
to
billy
all
this
was
but
occupying
her
mind
and
playing
assistant
to
a
worthy
young
couple
torn
cruelly
apart
by
an
unfeeling
fate
to
bertram
to
bertram
it
was
terror
and
woe
and
all
manner
of
torture
for
in
it
bertram
saw
only
a
growing
fondness
on
the
part
of
billy
for
arkwright
arkwright
music
arkwright
words
and
arkwright
friends
the
first
rehearsal
for
the
operetta
came
on
wednesday
evening
there
would
be
another
on
thursday
afternoon
billy
had
told
alice
greggory
to
arrange
her
pupils
so
that
she
could
stay
wednesday
night
at
hillside
if
the
crippled
mother
could
get
along
alone
and
she
could
alice
had
said
thursday
forenoon
therefore
alice
greggory
would
in
all
probability
be
at
hillside
specially
as
there
would
doubtless
be
an
appointment
or
two
for
private
rehearsal
with
some
nervous
soloist
whose
part
was
not
progressing
well
such
being
the
case
billy
had
a
plan
she
meant
to
carry
out
she
was
highly
pleased
therefore
when
thursday
morning
came
and
everything
apparently
was
working
exactly
to
her
mind
alice
was
there
she
had
an
appointment
at
quarter
of
eleven
with
the
leading
tenor
and
another
later
with
the
alto
after
breakfast
therefore
billy
said
decisively
now
if
you
please
miss
greggory
i
going
to
put
you
on
the
couch
in
the
for
a
but
i
just
got
up
remonstrated
miss
greggory
i
know
you
have
smiled
billy
but
you
were
very
late
to
bed
last
night
and
you
got
a
hard
day
before
you
i
insist
upon
your
resting
you
will
be
absolutely
undisturbed
there
and
you
must
shut
the
door
and
not
come
till
i
send
for
you
johnson
is
due
till
quarter
of
eleven
is
he
then
come
with
me
directed
billy
leading
the
way
there
now
do
come
down
till
i
call
you
she
went
on
when
they
had
reached
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
i
going
to
leave
aunt
hannah
door
open
so
you
have
good
air
she
is
in
there
writing
letters
in
my
room
now
here
a
book
and
you
read
but
i
should
prefer
you
to
sleep
she
nodded
brightly
as
she
went
out
and
shut
the
door
quietly
then
like
the
guilty
conspirator
she
was
she
went
to
wait
for
arkwright
it
was
a
fine
plan
arkwright
was
due
at
ten
billy
had
specially
asked
him
to
come
at
that
hour
he
would
not
know
of
course
that
alice
greggory
was
in
the
house
but
soon
after
his
arrival
billy
meant
to
excuse
herself
for
a
moment
slip
and
send
alice
greggory
down
for
a
book
a
pair
of
scissors
a
shawl
for
aunt
hannah
anything
would
do
for
a
pretext
anything
so
that
the
girl
might
walk
into
the
and
find
arkwright
waiting
for
her
alone
and
then
what
happened
next
was
in
billy
mind
very
vague
but
very
attractive
as
a
nucleus
for
one
thoughts
nevertheless
all
this
was
indeed
a
fine
plan
but
if
only
fine
plans
would
not
so
often
have
a
but
in
billy
case
the
but
had
to
do
with
things
so
apparently
unrelated
as
were
aunt
hannah
clock
and
a
negro
coal
wagon
the
clock
struck
eleven
at
ten
and
the
wagon
dumped
itself
to
destruction
directly
in
front
of
a
trolley
car
in
which
sat
arkwright
hurrying
to
keep
his
appointment
with
miss
billy
neilson
it
was
almost
ten
when
arkwright
finally
rang
the
bell
at
hillside
billy
greeted
him
so
eagerly
and
at
the
same
time
with
such
evident
disappointment
at
his
late
arrival
that
heart
sang
with
joy
but
there
a
rehearsal
at
quarter
of
eleven
exclaimed
billy
in
answer
to
his
hurried
explanation
of
the
delay
and
this
gives
so
little
time
for
for
so
little
time
you
know
she
finished
in
confusion
casting
frantically
about
in
her
mind
for
an
excuse
to
hurry
and
send
alice
greggory
down
before
it
should
be
quite
too
late
no
wonder
that
arkwright
noting
the
sparkle
in
her
eye
the
agitation
in
her
manner
and
the
embarrassed
red
in
her
cheek
took
new
courage
for
so
long
had
this
girl
held
him
at
the
end
of
a
major
third
or
a
diminished
seventh
for
so
long
had
she
blithely
accepted
his
every
word
and
act
as
devotion
to
music
not
herself
for
so
long
had
she
done
all
this
that
he
had
come
to
fear
that
never
would
she
do
anything
else
no
wonder
then
that
now
in
the
soft
radiance
of
the
strange
new
light
on
her
face
his
own
face
glowed
ardently
and
that
he
leaned
forward
with
an
impetuous
rush
of
eager
words
but
there
is
time
miss
billy
if
you
give
me
leave
to
say
i
afraid
i
kept
you
waiting
interrupted
the
hurried
voice
of
alice
greggory
from
the
hall
doorway
i
was
asleep
i
think
when
a
clock
somewhere
striking
eleven
why
arkwright
not
until
alice
greggory
had
nearly
crossed
the
room
did
she
see
that
the
man
standing
by
her
hostess
was
not
the
tenor
she
had
expected
to
find
but
an
old
acquaintance
then
it
was
that
the
tremulous
fell
from
her
lips
billy
and
arkwright
had
turned
at
her
first
words
at
her
last
arkwright
with
a
glance
at
billy
stepped
forward
miss
greggory
you
miss
alice
greggory
i
am
sure
he
said
pleasantly
at
the
first
opportunity
billy
murmured
a
hasty
excuse
and
left
the
room
to
aunt
hannah
she
flew
with
a
woebegone
face
oh
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
she
wailed
half
laughing
half
crying
that
wretched
little
of
a
clock
of
yours
spoiled
it
all
spoiled
it
spoiled
what
child
my
first
meeting
between
mary
jane
and
miss
greggory
i
had
it
all
arranged
that
they
were
to
have
it
but
that
miserable
little
fibber
struck
eleven
at
ten
and
miss
greggory
heard
it
and
thought
she
was
fifteen
minutes
late
so
down
she
hurried
half
awake
and
spoiled
all
my
plans
now
she
sitting
in
there
with
him
in
chairs
the
length
of
the
room
apart
discussing
the
snowstorm
last
night
or
the
moonrise
this
morning
or
some
other
such
silly
thing
and
i
had
it
so
beautifully
planned
well
well
dear
i
sorry
i
sure
smiled
aunt
hannah
but
i
ca
think
any
real
harm
is
done
did
mary
jane
have
anything
to
tell
her
about
her
father
i
mean
only
the
faintest
flicker
of
billy
eyelid
testified
that
the
everyday
accustomedness
of
that
mary
jane
on
aunt
hannah
lips
had
not
escaped
her
no
nothing
definite
yet
there
was
a
little
friends
are
still
trying
to
clear
his
name
and
i
believe
are
meeting
with
increasing
success
i
do
know
of
course
whether
he
say
anything
about
it
to
think
i
had
to
be
right
round
under
foot
like
that
when
they
met
went
on
billy
indignantly
i
should
have
been
in
a
minute
more
though
i
was
just
trying
to
think
up
an
excuse
to
come
up
and
send
down
miss
greggory
when
mary
jane
began
to
tell
me
something
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
then
appeared
and
it
was
all
over
and
there
the
doorbell
and
the
tenor
i
suppose
so
of
course
it
all
over
now
she
sighed
rising
to
go
as
it
chanced
however
it
was
not
the
tenor
but
a
message
from
him
a
message
that
brought
dire
consternation
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
arrangements
the
tenor
had
thrown
up
his
part
he
could
not
take
it
it
was
too
difficult
he
felt
that
this
should
be
told
at
once
rather
than
to
worry
along
for
another
week
or
two
and
then
give
up
so
he
had
told
it
but
what
shall
we
do
miss
greggory
appealed
billy
it
a
hard
part
you
know
but
if
tobey
ca
take
it
i
do
know
who
can
we
do
want
to
hire
a
singer
for
it
if
we
can
help
it
the
profits
are
to
go
to
the
home
for
crippled
children
you
know
she
explained
turning
to
arkwright
and
we
decided
to
hire
only
the
an
odd
expression
flitted
across
miss
greggory
face
mr
arkwright
used
to
sing
tenor
she
observed
quietly
as
if
he
did
now
a
perfectly
glorious
tenor
retorted
billy
but
as
if
would
take
for
only
a
brief
moment
did
arkwright
hesitate
then
blandly
he
suggested
suppose
you
try
him
and
billy
sat
suddenly
erect
would
you
really
you
take
the
time
and
all
she
cried
yes
i
think
i
would
under
the
circumstances
he
smiled
i
think
i
could
too
though
i
might
not
be
able
to
attend
all
the
rehearsals
still
if
i
find
i
have
to
ask
permission
i
endeavor
to
convince
the
that
singing
in
this
operetta
will
be
just
the
i
need
to
success
in
grand
oh
if
you
only
would
take
it
breathed
billy
we
be
so
glad
well
said
arkwright
his
eyes
on
billy
frankly
delighted
face
as
i
said
before
under
the
circumstances
i
think
i
thank
you
then
it
all
beautifully
settled
rejoiced
billy
with
a
happy
sigh
and
unconsciously
she
gave
alice
greggory
hand
near
her
a
little
pat
in
billy
mind
the
circumstances
of
arkwright
acceptance
of
the
part
were
alice
greggory
and
her
position
as
accompanist
of
course
billy
would
have
been
surprised
indeed
and
dismayed
had
she
known
that
in
arkwright
mind
the
circumstances
were
herself
and
the
fact
that
she
too
had
a
part
in
the
operetta
necessitating
her
presence
at
rehearsals
and
hinting
at
a
delightful
comradeship
impossible
perhaps
otherwise
chapter
xxiii
the
cause
and
bertram
february
came
the
operetta
for
which
billy
was
working
so
hard
was
to
be
given
the
twentieth
the
art
exhibition
for
which
bertram
was
preparing
his
four
pictures
was
to
open
the
sixteenth
with
a
private
view
for
specially
invited
friends
the
evening
before
on
the
eleventh
day
of
february
greggory
and
her
daughter
arrived
at
hillside
for
a
visit
not
until
after
a
great
deal
of
pleading
and
argument
however
had
billy
been
able
to
bring
this
about
but
my
dears
both
of
you
billy
had
at
last
said
to
them
just
listen
we
shall
have
numberless
rehearsals
during
those
last
ten
days
before
the
thing
comes
off
they
will
be
at
all
hours
and
of
all
lengths
you
miss
greggory
will
have
to
be
on
hand
for
them
all
of
course
and
will
have
to
stay
all
night
several
times
probably
you
greggory
ought
not
to
be
alone
down
here
there
is
no
sensible
valid
reason
why
you
should
not
both
come
out
to
the
house
for
those
ten
days
and
i
shall
feel
seriously
hurt
and
offended
if
you
do
not
consent
to
do
but
my
pupils
alice
greggory
had
demurred
you
can
go
in
town
from
my
home
at
any
time
to
give
your
lessons
and
a
little
shifting
about
and
arranging
for
those
ten
days
will
enable
you
to
set
the
hours
conveniently
one
after
another
i
am
sure
so
you
can
attend
to
several
on
one
trip
meanwhile
your
mother
will
be
having
a
lovely
time
teaching
aunt
hannah
how
to
knit
a
new
shawl
so
you
have
to
be
worrying
about
after
all
it
had
been
the
great
good
and
pleasure
which
the
visit
would
bring
to
greggory
that
had
been
the
final
straw
to
tip
the
scales
on
the
eleventh
of
february
therefore
in
the
company
of
the
once
scorned
peggy
and
mary
jane
alice
greggory
and
her
mother
had
arrived
at
hillside
ever
since
the
first
meeting
of
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
billy
had
been
sorely
troubled
by
the
conduct
of
the
two
young
people
she
had
as
she
mournfully
told
herself
been
able
to
make
nothing
of
it
the
two
were
civility
itself
to
each
other
but
very
plainly
they
were
not
at
ease
in
each
other
company
and
billy
much
to
her
surprise
had
to
admit
that
arkwright
did
not
appear
to
appreciate
the
circumstances
now
that
he
had
them
the
pair
called
each
other
ceremoniously
mr
arkwright
and
miss
greggory
but
then
that
of
course
did
not
signify
billy
declared
to
herself
i
suppose
you
do
ever
call
him
jane
she
said
to
the
girl
a
little
mischievously
one
day
jane
arkwright
no
i
do
rejoined
miss
greggory
with
an
odd
smile
then
after
a
moment
she
added
i
believe
his
brothers
and
sisters
used
to
yes
i
know
laughed
billy
we
thought
he
was
a
real
mary
jane
and
she
told
the
story
of
his
arrival
so
you
see
she
finished
when
alice
greggory
had
done
laughing
over
the
tale
he
always
will
be
jane
to
us
by
the
way
what
is
his
name
miss
greggory
looked
up
in
surprise
why
it
she
stopped
short
her
eyes
questioning
why
has
he
ever
told
you
she
queried
billy
lifted
her
chin
no
he
told
us
to
guess
it
and
we
have
guessed
everything
we
can
think
of
even
up
to
john
but
he
says
we
have
hit
it
john
indeed
laughed
the
other
merrily
well
i
sure
that
a
nice
solid
name
defended
billy
her
chin
still
at
a
challenging
tilt
if
it
is
john
what
is
it
then
but
alice
greggory
shook
her
head
she
too
it
seemed
could
be
firm
on
occasion
and
though
she
smiled
brightly
all
she
would
say
was
if
he
has
told
you
i
you
have
to
go
to
oh
well
i
can
still
call
him
jane
retorted
billy
with
airy
disdain
all
this
however
so
far
as
billy
could
see
was
not
in
the
least
helping
along
the
cause
that
had
become
so
dear
to
her
the
reuniting
of
a
pair
of
lovers
it
occurred
to
her
then
one
day
that
perhaps
after
all
they
were
not
lovers
and
did
not
wish
to
be
reunited
at
this
disquieting
thought
billy
decided
suddenly
to
go
almost
to
headquarters
she
would
speak
to
greggory
if
ever
the
opportunity
offered
great
was
her
joy
therefore
when
a
day
or
two
after
the
greggorys
arrived
at
the
house
greggory
chance
reference
to
arkwright
and
her
daughter
gave
billy
the
opportunity
she
sought
they
used
to
know
each
other
long
ago
arkwright
tells
me
billy
began
warily
the
quietly
polite
monosyllable
was
not
very
encouraging
to
be
sure
but
billy
secure
in
her
conviction
that
her
cause
was
a
righteous
one
refused
to
be
daunted
i
think
it
was
so
romantic
their
running
across
each
other
like
this
greggory
she
murmured
and
there
a
romance
was
there
i
have
just
felt
in
my
bones
that
there
was
a
romance
billy
held
her
breath
it
was
what
she
had
meant
to
say
but
now
that
she
had
said
it
the
words
seemed
very
fearsome
indeed
to
say
to
greggory
then
billy
remembered
her
cause
and
took
heart
billy
was
spelling
it
now
with
a
capital
for
a
long
minute
greggory
did
not
answer
for
so
long
a
minute
that
billy
breath
dropped
into
a
fluttering
sigh
and
her
cause
became
suddenly
impertinence
spelled
in
black
capitals
then
greggory
spoke
slowly
a
little
sadly
i
do
mind
saying
to
you
that
i
did
hope
once
that
there
would
be
a
romance
there
they
were
the
best
of
friends
and
they
were
to
each
other
in
tastes
and
temperament
i
think
indeed
that
the
romance
was
well
under
way
though
there
was
never
an
engagement
when
greggory
paused
and
wet
her
lips
her
voice
when
she
resumed
carried
the
stern
note
so
familiar
to
billy
in
her
first
acquaintance
with
this
woman
and
her
daughter
as
i
presume
arkwright
has
told
you
we
have
met
with
many
changes
in
our
life
changes
which
necessitated
a
new
home
and
a
new
mode
of
living
naturally
under
those
circumstances
old
friends
and
old
romances
must
change
but
greggory
stammered
billy
i
sure
arkwright
would
want
an
hand
silenced
her
peremptorily
mr
arkwright
was
very
kind
and
a
gentleman
always
interposed
the
lady
coldly
but
judge
greggory
daughter
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
placed
where
apologies
for
her
father
would
be
necessary
there
please
dear
miss
neilson
let
us
not
talk
of
it
any
more
begged
greggory
brokenly
no
indeed
of
course
not
cried
billy
but
her
heart
rejoiced
she
understood
it
all
now
arkwright
and
alice
greggory
had
been
almost
lovers
when
the
charges
against
the
judge
honor
had
plunged
the
family
into
despairing
humiliation
then
had
come
the
time
when
according
to
arkwright
own
story
the
two
women
had
shut
themselves
indoors
refused
to
see
their
friends
and
left
town
as
soon
as
possible
thus
had
come
the
breaking
of
whatever
tie
there
was
between
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
not
to
have
broken
it
would
have
meant
for
alice
the
placing
of
herself
in
a
position
where
sometime
apologies
must
be
made
for
her
father
this
was
what
greggory
had
meant
and
again
as
billy
thought
of
it
billy
heart
rejoiced
was
not
her
way
clear
now
before
her
did
she
not
have
it
in
her
power
possibly
even
probably
to
bring
happiness
where
only
sadness
was
before
as
if
it
would
not
be
a
simple
thing
to
rekindle
the
old
flame
to
make
these
two
estranged
hearts
beat
as
one
again
not
now
was
the
cause
an
impertinence
in
tall
black
letters
it
was
instead
a
shining
beacon
in
letters
of
flame
guiding
straight
to
victory
billy
went
to
sleep
that
night
making
plans
for
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
to
be
thrown
together
naturally
just
as
a
matter
of
course
you
know
she
said
drowsily
to
herself
all
in
the
dark
some
three
or
four
miles
away
down
beacon
street
at
that
moment
bertram
henshaw
in
the
strata
was
as
it
happened
not
falling
asleep
he
was
lying
broadly
and
unhappily
awake
bertram
very
frequently
lay
broadly
and
unhappily
awake
these
days
or
rather
nights
he
told
himself
on
these
occasions
that
it
was
perfectly
natural
indeed
it
was
that
billy
should
be
with
arkwright
and
his
friends
the
greggorys
so
much
there
were
the
new
songs
and
the
operetta
with
its
rehearsals
as
a
cause
for
it
all
at
the
same
time
deep
within
his
fearful
soul
was
the
consciousness
that
arkwright
the
greggorys
and
the
operetta
were
but
music
music
the
spectre
that
from
the
first
had
dogged
his
footsteps
with
billy
behavior
toward
himself
bertram
could
find
no
fault
she
was
always
her
sweet
loyal
lovable
self
eager
to
hear
of
his
work
earnestly
solicitous
that
it
should
be
a
success
she
even
as
he
sometimes
remembered
had
once
told
him
that
she
realized
he
belonged
to
art
before
he
did
to
himself
and
when
he
had
indignantly
denied
this
she
had
only
laughed
and
thrown
a
kiss
at
him
with
the
remark
that
he
ought
to
hear
his
sister
kate
opinion
of
that
matter
as
if
he
wanted
kate
opinion
on
that
or
anything
else
that
concerned
him
and
billy
once
torn
by
jealousy
and
exasperated
at
the
frequent
interruptions
of
their
quiet
hours
together
he
had
complained
openly
actually
billy
it
worse
than
marie
wedding
he
declared
it
was
tablecloths
and
napkins
that
could
be
dumped
in
a
chair
it
a
girl
who
wants
to
rehearse
or
a
woman
that
wants
a
different
wig
or
a
telephone
message
that
the
sopranos
have
quarrelled
again
i
loathe
that
operetta
billy
laughed
but
she
frowned
too
i
know
dear
i
do
like
that
part
i
wish
they
let
me
alone
when
i
with
you
but
as
for
the
operetta
it
is
really
a
good
thing
dear
and
you
say
so
when
you
see
it
it
going
to
be
a
great
success
i
can
say
that
because
my
part
is
only
a
small
one
you
know
we
shall
make
lots
of
money
for
the
home
too
i
but
you
wearing
yourself
all
out
with
it
dear
scowled
bertram
nonsense
i
like
it
besides
when
i
doing
this
i
not
telephoning
you
to
come
and
amuse
me
just
think
what
a
lot
of
extra
time
you
have
for
your
work
do
want
it
avowed
bertram
but
the
may
retorted
billy
showing
all
her
dimples
never
mind
though
it
all
be
over
after
the
twentieth
is
an
understudy
like
marie
wedding
you
know
she
finished
demurely
thank
heaven
for
that
bertram
had
breathed
fervently
but
even
as
he
said
the
words
he
grew
sick
with
fear
what
if
after
all
this
an
understudy
to
what
was
to
come
later
when
music
his
rival
had
really
conquered
bertram
knew
that
however
secure
might
seem
billy
affection
for
himself
there
was
still
in
his
own
mind
a
horrid
fear
lest
underneath
that
security
were
an
unconscious
growing
fondness
for
something
he
could
not
give
for
some
one
that
he
was
not
a
fondness
that
would
one
day
cause
billy
to
awake
as
bertram
in
his
morbid
fancy
pictured
it
he
realized
only
too
well
what
that
awakening
would
mean
to
himself
chapter
xxiv
the
artist
and
his
art
the
private
view
of
the
paintings
and
drawings
of
the
brush
and
pencil
club
on
the
evening
of
the
fifteenth
was
a
great
success
society
sent
its
fairest
women
in
frocks
that
were
pictures
in
themselves
art
sent
its
severest
critics
and
its
most
ardent
devotees
the
press
sent
reporters
that
the
world
might
know
what
art
and
society
were
doing
and
how
they
did
it
before
the
canvases
signed
with
bertram
henshaw
name
there
was
always
to
be
found
an
admiring
group
representing
both
art
and
society
with
the
press
on
the
outskirts
to
report
william
henshaw
coming
unobserved
upon
one
such
group
paused
a
moment
to
smile
at
the
various
more
or
less
disconnected
comments
what
a
lovely
blue
marvellous
color
sense
now
those
shadows
are
he
gets
his
high
lights
so
i
declare
she
looks
just
like
blanche
payton
every
line
there
is
full
of
i
suppose
it
very
fine
but
now
i
say
henshaw
is
is
this
by
the
man
that
painting
margy
winthrop
portrait
it
idealism
man
idealism
i
going
to
have
a
dress
just
that
shade
of
is
that
just
too
sweet
now
for
realism
i
consider
henshaw
there
are
many
with
his
sensitive
brilliant
oh
what
a
pretty
picture
william
moved
on
then
billy
was
rapturously
proud
of
bertram
that
evening
he
was
of
course
the
centre
of
congratulations
and
hearty
praise
at
his
side
billy
with
sparkling
eyes
welcomed
each
smiling
congratulation
and
gloried
in
every
commendatory
word
she
heard
oh
bertram
is
it
splendid
i
so
proud
of
you
she
whispered
softly
when
a
moment
lull
gave
her
opportunity
they
all
words
words
idle
words
he
laughed
but
his
eyes
shone
just
as
if
they
were
all
true
she
bridled
turning
to
greet
william
who
came
up
at
that
moment
is
it
fine
uncle
william
she
beamed
and
are
we
proud
of
him
we
are
indeed
smiled
the
man
but
if
you
and
bertram
want
to
get
the
real
opinion
of
this
crowd
you
should
go
and
stand
near
one
of
his
pictures
five
minutes
as
a
sort
of
crazy
quilt
criticism
it
ca
be
i
know
laughed
bertram
i
done
it
in
days
long
bertram
not
really
cried
billy
sure
as
if
every
young
artist
at
the
first
did
don
goggles
or
a
false
mustache
and
study
the
pictures
on
either
side
of
his
own
till
he
could
paint
them
with
his
eyes
shut
and
what
did
you
hear
demanded
the
girl
what
did
i
hear
laughed
her
lover
but
i
did
do
it
but
once
or
twice
i
lost
my
head
one
day
and
began
to
argue
the
question
of
perspective
with
a
couple
of
old
codgers
who
were
criticizing
a
bit
of
foreshortening
that
was
my
special
pet
i
forgot
my
goggles
and
sailed
in
the
game
was
up
then
of
course
and
i
never
put
them
on
again
but
it
was
worth
a
farm
to
see
their
faces
when
i
stood
as
the
serves
you
right
sir
listening
like
that
scolded
billy
bertram
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
it
cured
me
anyhow
i
have
done
it
since
he
declared
it
was
some
time
later
on
the
way
home
that
bertram
said
it
was
gratifying
of
course
billy
and
i
liked
it
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
i
did
like
the
many
pleasant
words
of
apparently
sincere
appreciation
i
heard
but
i
could
help
thinking
of
the
next
time
always
the
next
the
next
time
billy
eyes
were
slightly
puzzled
that
i
exhibit
i
mean
the
bohemian
ten
hold
their
exhibition
next
month
you
know
i
shall
show
just
one
picture
the
portrait
of
miss
oh
bertram
it
be
bertram
then
dear
if
it
is
a
success
he
sighed
i
do
believe
you
realize
yet
what
that
thing
is
going
to
mean
for
well
i
should
think
i
might
retorted
billy
a
little
tremulously
after
all
i
heard
about
it
i
should
think
knew
you
were
doing
it
bertram
actually
i
not
sure
marie
wo
ask
me
some
day
how
bertram
picture
is
coming
on
that
the
dickens
of
it
in
a
way
sighed
bertram
with
a
faint
smile
i
am
amazed
and
a
little
frightened
i
admit
at
the
universality
of
the
interest
you
see
the
winthrops
have
been
pleased
to
spread
it
for
one
reason
or
another
and
of
course
many
already
know
of
the
failures
of
anderson
and
fullam
that
why
if
i
should
fail
but
you
are
going
to
fail
interposed
the
girl
resolutely
no
i
know
i
not
i
only
said
fenced
the
man
his
voice
not
quite
steady
there
is
going
to
be
any
settled
billy
now
tell
me
when
is
the
exhibition
march
twentieth
the
private
view
winthrop
is
not
only
willing
but
anxious
that
i
show
it
i
was
sure
that
he
want
me
to
in
an
exhibition
but
it
seems
he
does
his
daughter
says
he
has
every
confidence
in
the
portrait
and
wants
everybody
to
see
that
where
he
shows
his
good
sense
declared
billy
then
with
just
a
touch
of
constraint
she
asked
and
how
is
the
new
latest
pose
coming
on
very
well
i
think
answered
bertram
a
little
hesitatingly
had
so
many
many
interruptions
though
that
it
is
surprising
how
slow
it
is
moving
in
the
first
place
miss
winthrop
is
gone
more
than
half
the
time
she
goes
again
for
a
week
and
in
this
portrait
i
not
painting
a
stroke
without
my
model
before
me
i
mean
to
take
no
chances
you
see
and
miss
winthrop
is
perfectly
willing
to
give
me
all
the
sittings
i
wish
for
of
course
if
she
had
changed
the
pose
and
costume
so
many
times
it
would
have
been
done
long
ago
and
she
knows
of
course
she
knows
it
murmured
billy
a
little
faintly
but
with
a
peculiar
intonation
in
her
voice
and
so
you
see
sighed
bertram
what
the
twentieth
of
march
is
going
to
mean
for
it
going
to
mean
a
splendid
triumph
asserted
billy
and
this
time
her
voice
was
not
faint
and
it
carried
only
a
ring
of
loyal
confidence
you
blessed
comforter
murmured
bertram
giving
with
his
eyes
the
caress
that
his
lips
would
so
much
have
preferred
to
give
under
more
propitious
circumstances
chapter
xxv
the
operetta
the
sixteenth
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
of
february
were
for
billy
and
for
all
concerned
in
the
success
of
the
operetta
days
of
hurry
worry
and
feverish
excitement
as
was
to
be
expected
of
course
each
afternoon
and
every
evening
saw
rehearsals
in
whole
or
in
parts
a
friend
of
the
woman
whose
husband
was
stage
manager
of
a
boston
theatre
had
consented
to
come
and
coach
the
performers
at
her
appearance
the
performers
promptly
thrown
into
nervous
spasms
by
this
fearsome
nearness
to
the
real
thing
forgot
half
their
cues
and
conducted
themselves
generally
like
frightened
school
children
on
piece
day
much
to
their
own
and
every
one
despair
then
on
the
evening
of
the
nineteenth
came
the
final
dress
rehearsal
on
the
stage
of
the
pretty
little
hall
that
had
been
engaged
for
the
performance
of
the
operetta
the
dress
rehearsal
like
most
of
its
kind
was
for
every
one
nothing
but
a
nightmare
of
discord
discouragement
and
disaster
nerves
were
on
edge
everybody
was
sure
the
thing
would
be
a
flat
the
soprano
sang
off
the
key
the
alto
forgot
to
shriek
beware
beware
until
it
was
so
late
there
was
nothing
to
beware
of
the
basso
stepped
on
billy
trailing
frock
and
tore
it
even
the
tenor
arkwright
himself
seemed
to
have
lost
every
bit
of
vim
from
his
acting
the
chorus
sang
oh
be
joyful
with
solemnity
and
danced
as
if
legs
and
feet
were
made
of
wood
the
lovers
after
the
fashion
of
amateur
actors
from
time
immemorial
made
love
like
billy
when
the
dismal
thing
had
dragged
its
way
through
the
final
note
sat
down
front
crying
softly
in
the
while
she
was
waiting
for
alice
greggory
to
run
it
through
just
once
more
with
a
pair
of
fairies
who
could
learn
that
a
duet
meant
a
not
two
solos
independently
hurried
or
retarded
as
one
fancy
for
the
moment
dictated
to
billy
just
then
life
did
not
look
to
be
even
half
worth
the
living
her
head
ached
her
throat
was
her
shoe
hurt
and
her
dress
the
trailing
frock
that
had
been
under
the
basso
foot
could
not
possibly
be
decently
repaired
before
night
she
was
sure
bad
as
these
things
were
however
they
were
only
the
intimate
immediate
woes
beyond
and
around
them
lay
others
many
others
to
be
sure
bertram
and
happiness
were
supposed
to
be
somewhere
in
the
dim
and
uncertain
future
but
between
her
and
them
lay
all
these
other
woes
chief
of
which
was
the
unutterable
tragedy
of
night
it
was
to
be
a
failure
of
course
billy
had
calmly
made
up
her
mind
to
that
now
but
then
she
was
used
to
failures
she
told
herself
was
she
not
plainly
failing
every
day
of
her
life
to
bring
about
even
friendship
between
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
did
they
not
emphatically
and
systematically
refuse
to
be
thrown
together
either
naturally
or
unnaturally
and
yet
whenever
again
could
she
expect
such
opportunities
to
further
her
cause
as
had
been
hers
the
past
few
weeks
through
the
operetta
and
its
rehearsals
certainly
never
again
it
had
been
a
failure
like
all
the
rest
like
the
operetta
in
particular
billy
did
not
mean
that
any
one
should
know
she
was
crying
she
supposed
that
all
the
performers
except
herself
and
the
two
fairies
by
the
piano
with
alice
greggory
were
gone
she
knew
that
john
with
peggy
was
probably
waiting
at
the
door
outside
and
she
hoped
that
soon
the
fairies
would
decide
to
go
home
and
go
to
bed
and
let
other
people
do
the
same
for
her
part
she
did
not
see
why
they
were
struggling
so
hard
anyway
why
need
they
go
ahead
and
sing
their
duet
like
two
solos
if
they
wanted
to
as
if
a
little
thing
like
that
could
make
a
feather
weight
of
difference
in
the
grand
total
of
wretchedness
when
the
final
curtain
should
have
been
rung
down
on
their
shame
miss
neilson
you
are
crying
exclaimed
a
low
voice
and
billy
turned
to
find
arkwright
standing
by
her
side
in
the
dim
light
oh
no
yes
well
maybe
i
was
a
little
stammered
billy
trying
to
speak
very
unconcernedly
how
warm
it
is
in
here
do
you
think
going
to
rain
that
is
outdoors
of
course
i
arkwright
dropped
into
the
seat
behind
billy
and
leaned
forward
his
eyes
striving
to
read
the
girl
face
if
billy
had
turned
she
would
have
seen
that
arkwright
own
face
showed
white
and
a
little
in
the
feeble
rays
from
the
light
by
the
piano
but
billy
did
not
turn
she
kept
her
eyes
steadily
averted
and
she
went
on
speaking
airy
inconsequential
words
dear
me
if
those
girls
only
pull
together
but
then
the
difference
i
supposed
you
had
gone
home
long
ago
miss
neilson
you
crying
arkwright
voice
was
low
and
vibrant
as
if
anything
or
anybody
in
the
world
make
cry
please
you
have
only
to
command
me
and
i
will
sally
forth
at
once
to
slay
the
his
words
were
light
but
his
voice
still
shook
with
emotion
billy
gave
an
hysterical
little
giggle
angrily
she
brushed
the
persistent
tears
from
her
eyes
all
right
then
i
dub
you
my
sir
knight
she
faltered
but
warn
you
you
have
your
hands
full
you
have
to
slay
my
headache
and
my
and
my
shoe
that
hurts
and
the
man
who
stepped
on
my
dress
and
and
everybody
in
the
operetta
including
everybody
in
the
operetta
arkwright
did
look
a
little
startled
at
this
wholesale
slaughter
yes
did
you
ever
see
such
an
awful
awful
thing
as
that
was
moaned
the
girl
arkwright
face
relaxed
oh
so
what
it
is
he
laughed
lightly
then
it
only
a
bogy
of
fear
that
i
got
to
slay
after
all
and
i
despatch
that
right
now
with
a
single
blow
dress
rehearsals
always
go
like
that
i
been
in
a
dozen
and
i
never
yet
saw
one
go
half
decent
do
you
worry
the
worse
the
rehearsal
the
better
the
performance
every
time
billy
blinked
off
the
tears
and
essayed
a
smile
as
she
retorted
well
if
that
so
then
ours
night
ought
to
be
a
a
a
corker
helped
out
arkwright
promptly
and
it
will
be
too
you
poor
child
you
worn
out
and
no
wonder
but
do
worry
another
bit
about
the
operetta
now
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
anything
else
i
can
slay
billy
laughed
tremulously
thank
you
not
that
you
can
slay
i
fancy
she
sighed
that
is
not
that
you
she
amended
wistfully
with
a
sudden
remembrance
of
the
cause
for
which
he
might
do
so
much
if
he
only
would
arkwright
bent
a
little
nearer
his
breath
stirred
the
loose
curling
hair
behind
billy
ear
his
eyes
had
flashed
into
sudden
fire
but
you
do
know
what
i
do
if
i
could
he
murmured
unsteadily
if
you
let
me
tell
you
if
you
only
knew
the
wish
that
has
lain
closest
to
my
heart
for
miss
neilson
please
called
the
despairing
voice
of
one
of
the
fairies
miss
neilson
you
there
are
you
yes
i
right
here
answered
billy
wearily
arkwright
answered
too
but
not
aloud
which
was
wise
oh
dear
you
tired
i
know
wailed
the
fairy
but
if
you
would
please
come
and
help
us
just
a
minute
could
you
why
yes
of
billy
rose
to
her
feet
still
wearily
arkwright
touched
her
arm
she
turned
and
saw
his
face
it
was
very
white
so
white
that
her
eyes
widened
in
surprised
questioning
as
if
answering
the
unspoken
words
the
man
shook
his
head
i
ca
now
of
course
he
said
but
there
something
i
want
to
say
a
story
i
want
to
tell
you
after
perhaps
may
i
to
billy
the
tremor
of
his
voice
the
suffering
in
his
eyes
and
the
story
he
was
begging
to
tell
could
have
but
one
interpretation
alice
greggory
her
face
therefore
was
a
glory
of
tender
sympathy
as
she
reached
out
her
hand
in
farewell
of
course
you
may
she
cried
come
any
time
after
night
please
she
smiled
encouragingly
as
she
turned
toward
the
stage
behind
her
arkwright
stumbled
twice
as
he
walked
up
the
incline
toward
the
outer
door
stumbled
not
because
of
the
of
the
little
theatre
but
because
of
the
blinding
radiance
of
a
girl
illumined
face
which
he
had
a
moment
before
read
all
unknowingly
exactly
wrong
a
little
more
than
hours
later
billy
neilson
in
her
own
room
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
it
was
twelve
on
the
night
of
the
twentieth
and
the
operetta
was
over
to
billy
life
was
eminently
worth
living
her
head
did
not
ache
her
throat
was
not
sore
her
shoe
did
not
hurt
her
dress
had
been
mended
so
successfully
by
aunt
hannah
and
with
such
comforting
celerity
that
long
before
night
one
would
never
have
suspected
the
filmy
thing
had
known
the
devastating
tread
of
any
man
foot
better
yet
the
soprano
had
sung
exactly
to
key
the
alto
had
shrieked
beware
to
thrilling
purpose
arkwright
had
shown
all
his
old
charm
and
vim
and
the
chorus
had
been
prodigies
of
joyousness
and
marvels
of
lightness
even
the
lovers
had
lost
their
stiffness
while
the
two
fairies
of
the
night
before
had
found
so
amiable
a
meeting
point
that
their
solos
sounded
to
the
uninitiated
very
like
indeed
a
duet
the
operetta
was
in
short
a
glorious
and
gratifying
success
both
artistically
and
financially
nor
was
this
all
that
to
billy
made
life
worth
the
living
arkwright
had
begged
permission
that
evening
to
come
up
the
following
afternoon
to
tell
her
his
story
and
billy
who
was
so
joyously
confident
that
this
story
meant
the
final
crowning
of
her
cause
with
victory
had
given
happy
consent
bertram
was
to
come
up
in
the
evening
and
billy
was
anticipating
that
too
particularly
it
had
been
so
long
since
they
had
known
a
really
free
comfortable
evening
together
with
nothing
to
interrupt
doubtless
too
after
arkwright
visit
of
the
afternoon
she
would
be
in
a
position
to
tell
bertram
the
story
of
the
suspended
romance
between
arkwright
and
miss
greggory
and
perhaps
something
also
of
her
own
efforts
to
bring
the
couple
together
again
on
the
whole
life
did
indeed
look
decidedly
worth
the
living
as
billy
with
a
contented
sigh
turned
over
to
go
to
sleep
chapter
xxvi
arkwright
tells
another
story
promptly
at
the
suggested
hour
on
the
day
after
the
operetta
arkwright
rang
billy
neilson
doorbell
promptly
too
billy
herself
came
into
the
to
greet
him
billy
was
in
white
a
soft
creamy
white
wool
with
a
touch
of
black
velvet
at
her
throat
and
in
her
hair
the
man
thought
she
had
never
looked
so
lovely
arkwright
was
still
under
the
spell
wrought
by
the
soft
radiance
of
billy
face
the
two
times
he
had
mentioned
his
until
the
night
before
the
operetta
arkwright
had
been
more
than
doubtful
of
the
way
that
story
would
be
received
should
he
ever
summon
the
courage
to
tell
it
since
then
his
fears
had
been
changed
to
rapturous
hopes
it
was
very
eagerly
therefore
that
he
turned
now
to
greet
billy
as
she
came
into
the
room
suppose
we
do
have
any
music
suppose
we
give
the
whole
time
up
to
the
story
she
smiled
brightly
as
she
held
out
her
hand
arkwright
heart
leaped
but
almost
at
once
it
throbbed
with
a
vague
uneasiness
he
would
have
preferred
to
see
her
blush
and
be
a
little
shy
over
that
story
still
there
was
a
chance
of
course
that
she
did
not
know
what
the
story
was
but
if
that
were
the
case
what
of
the
radiance
in
her
face
what
of
finding
himself
in
a
tangled
labyrinth
that
led
apparently
only
to
disappointment
and
disaster
arkwright
pulled
himself
up
with
a
firm
hand
you
are
very
kind
he
murmured
as
he
relinquished
her
fingers
and
seated
himself
near
her
you
are
sure
then
that
you
wish
to
hear
the
story
very
sure
smiled
billy
arkwright
hesitated
again
he
longed
to
see
a
little
embarrassment
in
the
bright
face
opposite
suddenly
it
came
to
him
however
that
if
billy
knew
what
he
was
about
to
say
it
would
manifestly
not
be
her
part
to
act
as
if
she
knew
with
a
lighter
heart
then
he
began
his
story
you
want
it
from
the
beginning
by
all
means
i
never
dip
into
books
nor
peek
at
the
ending
i
think
it
fair
to
the
then
i
will
indeed
begin
at
the
beginning
smiled
arkwright
for
i
specially
anxious
that
you
shall
be
even
more
than
to
his
voice
shook
a
little
but
he
hurried
on
there
a
girl
in
it
a
very
dear
lovely
of
course
if
it
a
nice
story
twinkled
billy
and
there
a
man
too
it
a
love
story
you
again
of
course
if
it
billy
laughed
mischievously
but
she
flushed
a
little
still
the
man
does
amount
to
much
after
all
perhaps
i
might
as
well
own
up
at
the
beginning
i
the
that
will
do
for
you
to
say
as
long
as
you
telling
the
story
smiled
billy
we
let
it
pass
for
proper
modesty
on
your
part
but
i
shall
say
the
personal
touch
only
adds
to
the
arkwright
drew
in
his
breath
we
hope
it
really
be
so
he
murmured
there
was
a
moment
silence
arkwright
seemed
to
be
hesitating
what
to
say
well
prompted
billy
with
a
smile
we
have
the
hero
and
the
heroine
now
what
happens
next
do
you
know
she
added
i
have
always
thought
that
part
must
bother
the
to
get
the
couple
to
doing
interesting
things
after
they
got
them
arkwright
sighed
perhaps
on
paper
but
you
see
my
story
has
been
so
far
so
it
quite
very
well
then
what
did
happen
smiled
billy
i
was
trying
to
think
of
the
first
thing
you
see
it
began
with
a
picture
a
photograph
of
the
girl
mother
had
it
i
saw
it
and
wanted
it
and
arkwright
had
started
to
say
and
took
but
he
stopped
with
the
last
two
words
unsaid
it
was
not
time
yet
he
deemed
to
tell
this
girl
how
much
that
picture
had
been
to
him
for
so
many
months
past
he
hurried
on
a
little
precipitately
you
see
i
had
heard
about
this
girl
a
lot
and
i
liked
what
i
you
mean
you
did
know
her
at
the
first
billy
eyes
were
surprised
billy
had
supposed
that
arkwright
had
always
known
alice
greggory
no
i
did
know
the
girl
till
afterwards
before
that
i
was
always
dreaming
and
wondering
what
she
would
be
oh
billy
subsided
into
her
chair
still
with
the
puzzled
questioning
in
her
eyes
then
i
met
yes
and
she
was
everything
and
more
than
i
had
pictured
and
you
fell
in
love
at
once
billy
voice
had
grown
confident
again
oh
i
was
already
in
love
sighed
arkwright
i
simply
sank
breathed
billy
sympathetically
and
the
girl
she
did
care
or
know
for
a
long
time
i
not
really
sure
she
cares
or
knows
even
arkwright
eyes
were
wistfully
fixed
on
billy
face
oh
but
you
ca
tell
always
about
girls
murmured
billy
hurriedly
a
faint
pink
had
stolen
to
her
forehead
she
was
thinking
of
alice
greggory
and
wondering
if
indeed
alice
did
care
and
if
she
billy
might
dare
to
assure
this
man
what
she
believed
to
be
true
that
his
sweetheart
was
only
waiting
for
him
to
come
to
her
and
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
arkwright
saw
the
color
sweep
to
billy
forehead
and
took
sudden
courage
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
a
tender
light
came
to
his
eyes
the
expression
on
his
face
was
unmistakable
billy
do
you
mean
really
that
there
is
hope
for
me
he
begged
brokenly
billy
gave
a
visible
start
a
quick
something
like
shocked
terror
came
to
her
eyes
she
drew
back
and
would
have
risen
to
her
feet
had
the
thought
not
come
to
her
that
twice
before
she
had
supposed
a
man
was
making
love
to
her
when
subsequent
events
proved
that
she
had
been
mortifyingly
mistaken
once
when
cyril
had
told
her
of
his
love
for
marie
and
again
when
william
had
asked
her
to
come
back
as
a
daughter
to
the
house
she
had
left
desolate
telling
herself
sternly
now
not
to
be
for
the
third
time
a
foolish
little
simpleton
she
summoned
all
her
wits
forced
a
cheery
smile
to
her
lips
and
said
well
really
arkwright
of
course
i
ca
answer
for
the
girl
so
i
not
the
one
to
give
hope
and
but
you
are
the
one
interrupted
the
man
passionately
you
the
only
one
as
if
from
the
very
first
i
had
loved
you
and
no
no
not
that
not
that
i
mistaken
i
not
understanding
what
you
mean
pleaded
a
voice
billy
was
on
her
feet
now
holding
up
two
protesting
hands
palms
outward
miss
neilson
you
do
mean
that
you
have
known
all
this
time
that
it
was
you
the
man
now
was
on
his
feet
his
eyes
hurt
and
unbelieving
looking
into
hers
billy
paled
she
began
slowly
to
back
away
her
eyes
still
fixed
on
his
carried
the
shrinking
terror
of
one
who
sees
a
horrid
vision
but
you
know
you
know
that
i
am
not
yours
to
win
she
reproached
him
sharply
i
to
be
bertram
henshaw
from
billy
shocked
young
lips
the
word
dropped
with
a
ringing
force
that
was
at
once
accusatory
and
prohibitive
it
was
as
if
by
the
mere
utterance
of
the
word
wife
she
had
drawn
a
sacred
circle
about
her
and
placed
herself
in
sanctuary
from
the
blazing
accusation
in
her
eyes
arkwright
fell
back
wife
you
are
to
be
bertram
henshaw
wife
he
exclaimed
there
was
no
mistaking
the
amazed
incredulity
on
his
face
billy
caught
her
breath
the
righteous
indignation
in
her
eyes
fled
and
a
terrified
appeal
took
its
place
you
do
mean
that
you
know
she
faltered
there
was
a
moment
silence
a
power
quite
outside
herself
kept
eyes
on
arkwright
face
and
forced
her
to
watch
the
change
there
from
unbelief
to
belief
and
from
belief
to
set
misery
no
i
did
not
know
said
the
man
then
dully
as
he
turned
rested
his
arm
on
the
mantel
behind
him
and
half
shielded
his
face
with
his
hand
billy
sank
into
a
low
chair
her
fingers
fluttered
nervously
to
her
throat
her
piteous
beseeching
eyes
were
on
the
broad
back
and
bent
head
of
the
man
before
her
but
i
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
helped
knowing
she
stammered
at
last
i
do
see
how
such
a
thing
could
have
happened
that
you
should
know
i
been
trying
to
think
myself
returned
the
man
still
in
a
dull
emotionless
voice
it
been
so
so
much
a
matter
of
course
i
supposed
everybody
knew
it
maintained
billy
perhaps
that
just
it
that
it
was
so
much
a
matter
of
course
rejoined
the
man
you
see
i
know
very
few
of
your
friends
anyway
who
would
be
apt
to
mention
it
to
but
the
announcements
oh
you
were
here
then
moaned
billy
but
you
must
have
known
that
that
he
came
here
a
good
deal
that
we
were
together
so
much
to
a
certain
extent
yes
sighed
arkwright
but
i
took
your
friendship
with
him
and
his
brothers
as
as
a
matter
of
course
was
of
course
you
see
he
went
on
bitterly
i
knew
you
were
william
henshaw
namesake
and
calderwell
had
told
me
the
story
of
your
coming
to
them
when
you
were
left
alone
in
the
world
calderwell
had
said
too
that
arkwright
paused
then
hurried
on
a
little
constrainedly
well
he
said
something
that
led
me
to
think
bertram
henshaw
was
not
a
marrying
man
billy
winced
and
changed
color
she
had
noticed
the
pause
and
she
knew
very
well
what
it
was
that
calderwell
had
said
to
occasion
that
pause
must
she
be
reminded
that
no
one
expected
bertram
henshaw
to
love
any
girl
except
to
paint
but
but
calderwell
must
know
about
the
engagement
now
she
stammered
very
likely
but
i
have
not
happened
to
hear
from
him
since
my
arrival
in
boston
we
do
not
there
was
a
long
silence
then
arkwright
spoke
again
i
think
i
understand
now
many
things
i
wonder
i
did
not
see
them
before
but
i
never
thought
of
bertram
henshaw
being
if
calderwell
had
said
again
arkwright
stopped
with
his
sentence
half
complete
and
again
billy
winced
i
been
a
blind
fool
i
was
so
intent
on
my
own
i
been
a
blind
fool
that
all
repeated
arkwright
with
a
break
in
his
voice
billy
tried
to
speak
but
instead
of
words
there
came
only
a
choking
sob
arkwright
turned
sharply
miss
neilson
do
please
he
begged
there
is
no
need
that
you
should
suffer
but
i
am
so
ashamed
that
such
a
thing
happen
she
faltered
i
sure
some
way
i
must
be
to
blame
but
i
never
thought
i
was
blind
too
i
was
wrapped
up
in
my
own
affairs
i
never
suspected
i
never
even
to
suspect
i
thought
of
course
you
knew
it
was
just
the
music
that
brought
us
together
i
supposed
and
you
were
just
like
one
of
the
family
anyway
i
always
thought
of
you
as
aunt
hannah
she
stopped
with
a
vivid
blush
as
aunt
hannah
niece
mary
jane
of
course
supplied
arkwright
bitterly
turning
back
to
his
old
position
and
that
was
my
own
fault
too
my
name
miss
neilson
is
michael
jeremiah
he
went
on
wearily
after
a
moment
hesitation
his
voice
showing
his
utter
abandonment
to
despair
when
a
boy
at
school
i
got
heartily
sick
of
the
and
the
and
the
even
worse
and
jerry
that
my
young
friends
delighted
in
so
as
soon
as
possible
i
sought
obscurity
and
peace
in
j
much
to
my
surprise
and
annoyance
the
initials
proved
to
be
little
better
for
they
became
at
once
the
biggest
sort
of
whet
to
curiosity
naturally
the
more
determined
persistent
inquirers
were
to
know
the
name
the
more
determined
i
became
that
they
should
all
very
silly
and
very
foolish
of
course
certainly
it
seems
so
now
he
finished
billy
was
silent
she
was
trying
to
find
something
to
say
when
arkwright
began
speaking
again
still
in
that
dull
hopeless
voice
that
billy
thought
would
break
her
heart
as
for
the
jane
that
was
another
foolishness
of
course
my
small
brothers
and
sisters
originated
it
others
followed
on
occasion
even
calderwell
perhaps
you
did
not
know
but
he
was
the
friend
who
by
his
laughing
question
do
you
mary
jane
put
into
my
head
the
crazy
scheme
of
writing
to
aunt
hannah
and
letting
her
think
i
was
a
real
mary
jane
you
see
what
i
stooped
to
do
miss
neilson
for
the
chance
of
meeting
and
knowing
billy
gave
a
low
cry
she
had
suddenly
remembered
the
beginning
of
arkwright
story
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
he
had
been
talking
then
about
herself
not
alice
greggory
but
you
do
mean
that
you
cared
that
i
was
the
she
could
not
finish
arkwright
turned
from
the
mantel
with
a
gesture
of
utter
despair
yes
i
cared
then
i
had
heard
of
you
i
had
sung
your
songs
i
was
determined
to
meet
you
so
i
came
and
met
you
after
that
i
was
more
determined
than
ever
to
win
you
perhaps
you
see
now
why
i
was
so
blind
to
to
any
other
possibility
but
it
does
do
any
good
to
talk
like
this
i
understand
now
only
please
do
blame
yourself
he
begged
as
he
saw
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
billy
had
turned
away
and
was
crying
softly
so
she
did
not
see
him
go
chapter
xxvii
the
thing
that
was
the
truth
bertram
called
that
evening
billy
had
no
story
now
to
tell
nothing
of
the
interrupted
romance
between
alice
greggory
and
arkwright
billy
carefully
indeed
avoided
mentioning
arkwright
name
ever
since
the
man
departure
that
afternoon
billy
had
been
frantically
trying
to
assure
herself
that
she
was
not
to
blame
that
she
would
not
be
supposed
to
know
he
cared
for
her
that
it
had
all
been
as
he
said
it
was
his
foolish
blindness
but
even
when
she
had
partially
comforted
herself
by
these
assertions
she
could
not
by
any
means
escape
the
haunting
vision
of
the
man
suffering
face
as
she
had
seen
it
that
afternoon
nor
could
she
keep
from
weeping
at
the
memory
of
the
words
he
had
said
and
at
the
thought
that
never
again
could
their
pleasant
friendship
be
quite
the
same
if
indeed
there
could
be
any
friendship
at
all
between
them
but
if
billy
expected
that
her
red
eyes
pale
cheeks
and
generally
troubled
appearance
and
unquiet
manner
were
to
be
passed
unnoticed
by
her
lover
keen
eyes
that
evening
she
found
herself
much
mistaken
sweetheart
what
the
matter
demanded
bertram
resolutely
at
last
when
his
more
indirect
questions
had
been
evasively
turned
aside
you
ca
make
me
think
there
is
something
the
trouble
because
i
know
there
is
well
then
there
is
dear
smiled
billy
tearfully
but
please
just
do
let
us
talk
of
it
i
i
want
to
forget
it
truly
i
but
i
want
to
know
so
can
forget
it
persisted
bertram
what
is
it
maybe
i
could
she
shook
her
head
with
a
little
frightened
cry
no
no
you
ca
help
but
sweetheart
you
do
know
perhaps
i
could
wo
you
me
about
it
billy
looked
distressed
i
ca
dear
truly
you
see
it
is
quite
mine
to
not
yours
not
but
it
makes
you
feel
bad
yes
then
ca
i
know
that
part
oh
no
no
indeed
no
you
see
it
would
be
fair
to
the
bertram
stared
a
little
then
his
mouth
set
into
stern
lines
billy
what
are
you
talking
about
seems
to
me
i
have
a
right
to
billy
hesitated
to
her
mind
a
girl
who
would
tell
of
the
unrequited
love
of
a
man
for
herself
was
unspeakably
base
to
tell
bertram
arkwright
love
story
was
therefore
impossible
yet
in
some
way
she
must
set
bertram
mind
at
rest
dearest
she
began
slowly
her
eyes
wistfully
pleading
just
what
it
is
i
ca
tell
you
in
a
way
it
another
secret
and
i
do
feel
that
i
have
the
right
to
tell
it
it
just
something
that
i
learned
this
but
it
has
made
you
cry
yes
it
made
me
feel
very
then
it
was
something
you
could
help
to
bertram
surprise
the
face
he
was
watching
so
intently
flushed
scarlet
no
i
could
help
it
now
though
i
might
have
billy
spoke
this
last
just
above
her
breath
then
she
went
on
beseechingly
bertram
please
please
do
talk
of
it
any
more
it
it
just
spoiling
our
happy
evening
together
bertram
bit
his
lip
and
drew
a
long
sigh
all
right
dear
you
know
best
of
course
since
i
do
know
about
it
he
finished
a
little
stiffly
billy
began
to
talk
then
very
brightly
of
aunt
hannah
and
her
shawls
and
of
a
visit
she
had
made
to
cyril
and
marie
that
morning
and
do
you
know
aunt
hannah
clock
done
a
good
turn
at
last
and
justified
its
existence
listen
she
cried
gayly
marie
had
a
letter
from
her
mother
cousin
jane
cousin
jane
could
sleep
nights
because
she
was
always
lying
awake
to
find
out
just
what
time
it
was
so
marie
had
written
her
about
aunt
hannah
clock
and
now
this
cousin
jane
has
fixed
clock
and
she
sleeps
like
a
top
just
because
she
knows
there
never
be
but
half
an
hour
that
she
does
know
what
time
it
is
bertram
smiled
and
murmured
a
polite
well
i
sure
that
fine
but
the
words
were
plainly
abstracted
and
the
frown
had
not
left
his
brow
nor
did
it
quite
leave
till
some
time
later
when
billy
in
answer
to
a
question
of
his
about
another
operetta
cried
with
a
shudder
mercy
i
hope
not
dear
i
do
want
to
the
word
again
for
a
year
bertram
smiled
then
broadly
he
too
would
be
quite
satisfied
not
to
hear
the
word
operetta
for
a
year
operetta
to
bertram
meant
interruptions
interferences
and
the
constant
presence
of
arkwright
the
greggorys
and
innumerable
creatures
who
wished
to
rehearse
or
to
change
wigs
all
of
which
bertram
abhorred
no
wonder
therefore
that
he
smiled
and
that
the
frown
disappeared
from
his
brow
he
thought
he
saw
ahead
serene
blissful
days
for
billy
and
himself
as
the
days
however
began
to
pass
one
by
one
bertram
henshaw
found
them
to
be
anything
but
serene
and
blissful
the
operetta
with
its
rehearsals
and
its
interruptions
was
gone
certainly
but
he
was
becoming
seriously
troubled
about
billy
billy
did
not
act
natural
sometimes
she
seemed
like
her
old
self
and
he
breathed
more
freely
telling
himself
that
his
fears
were
groundless
then
would
come
the
haunting
shadow
to
her
eyes
the
droop
to
her
mouth
and
the
nervousness
to
her
manner
that
he
so
dreaded
worse
yet
all
this
seemed
to
be
connected
in
some
strange
way
with
arkwright
he
found
this
out
by
accident
one
day
she
had
been
talking
and
laughing
brightly
about
something
when
he
chanced
to
introduce
arkwright
name
by
the
way
where
is
mary
jane
these
days
he
asked
then
i
do
know
i
sure
he
has
been
here
lately
murmured
billy
reaching
for
a
book
on
the
table
at
a
peculiar
something
in
her
voice
he
had
looked
up
quickly
only
to
find
to
his
great
surprise
that
her
face
showed
a
painful
flush
as
she
bent
over
the
book
in
her
hand
he
had
said
nothing
more
at
the
time
but
he
had
not
forgotten
several
times
after
that
he
had
introduced
the
man
name
and
never
had
it
failed
to
bring
a
rush
of
color
a
biting
of
the
lip
or
a
quick
change
of
position
followed
always
by
the
troubled
eyes
and
nervous
manner
that
he
had
learned
to
dread
he
noticed
then
that
never
of
her
own
free
will
did
she
herself
mention
the
man
never
did
she
speak
of
him
with
the
old
frank
lightness
as
mary
by
casual
questions
asked
from
time
to
time
bertram
had
learned
that
arkwright
never
came
there
now
and
that
the
together
had
been
given
up
curiously
enough
this
discovery
which
would
once
have
filled
bertram
with
joy
served
now
only
to
deepen
his
distress
that
there
was
anything
inconsistent
in
the
fact
that
he
was
more
frightened
now
at
the
man
absence
than
he
had
been
before
at
his
presence
did
not
occur
to
him
he
knew
only
that
he
was
frightened
and
badly
frightened
bertram
had
not
forgotten
the
evening
after
the
operetta
and
face
on
that
occasion
he
dated
the
whole
thing
in
fact
from
that
evening
he
fell
to
wondering
one
day
if
that
too
had
anything
to
do
with
arkwright
he
determined
then
to
find
out
shamelessly
for
the
good
of
the
cause
he
set
a
trap
for
billy
unwary
feet
very
adroitly
one
day
he
led
the
talk
straight
to
arkwright
then
he
asked
abruptly
where
is
the
chap
i
wonder
why
he
has
shown
up
once
since
the
operetta
has
he
billy
always
truthful
and
just
now
always
embarrassed
when
arkwright
name
was
mentioned
walked
straight
into
the
trap
oh
yes
well
he
was
here
once
the
day
after
the
operetta
i
seen
him
bertram
answered
a
light
something
but
his
face
grew
a
little
white
now
that
the
trap
had
been
sprung
and
the
victim
caught
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
not
set
any
trap
at
all
he
knew
now
it
was
true
arkwright
had
been
with
billy
the
day
after
the
operetta
and
her
tears
and
her
distress
that
evening
had
been
caused
by
something
arkwright
had
said
it
was
arkwright
secret
that
she
could
not
tell
it
was
arkwright
to
whom
she
must
be
fair
it
was
sorrow
that
she
could
not
help
naturally
with
these
tools
in
his
hands
and
aided
by
days
of
brooding
and
nights
of
sleeplessness
it
did
not
take
bertram
long
to
fashion
the
thing
that
finally
loomed
before
him
as
the
truth
he
understood
it
all
now
music
had
conquered
billy
and
arkwright
had
found
that
they
loved
each
other
on
the
day
after
the
operetta
they
had
met
and
had
had
some
sort
of
scene
together
doubtless
arkwright
had
declared
his
love
that
was
the
secret
that
billy
could
not
tell
and
be
billy
of
course
loyal
little
soul
that
she
was
had
sent
him
away
at
once
was
her
hand
not
already
pledged
that
was
why
she
could
not
help
bertram
writhed
in
agony
at
the
thought
since
that
meeting
arkwright
had
not
been
near
the
house
billy
had
found
however
that
her
heart
had
gone
with
arkwright
hence
the
shadow
in
her
eyes
the
nervousness
in
her
manner
and
the
embarrassment
that
she
always
showed
at
the
mention
of
his
name
that
billy
was
still
outwardly
loyal
to
himself
and
that
she
still
kept
to
her
engagement
did
not
surprise
bertram
in
the
least
that
was
like
billy
bertram
had
not
forgotten
how
less
than
a
year
before
this
same
billy
had
held
herself
loyal
and
true
to
an
engagement
with
william
because
a
wretched
mistake
all
around
had
caused
her
to
give
her
promise
to
be
william
wife
under
the
impression
that
she
was
carrying
out
william
dearest
wish
bertram
remembered
her
face
as
it
had
looked
all
those
long
summer
days
while
her
heart
was
being
slowly
broken
and
he
thought
he
could
see
that
same
look
in
her
eyes
now
all
of
which
only
goes
to
prove
with
what
woeful
skill
bertram
had
fashioned
this
thing
that
was
looming
before
him
as
the
truth
the
exhibition
of
the
bohemian
ten
was
to
open
with
a
private
view
on
the
evening
of
the
twentieth
of
march
bertram
henshaw
one
contribution
was
to
be
his
portrait
of
miss
marguerite
winthrop
the
piece
of
work
that
had
come
to
mean
so
much
to
him
the
piece
of
work
upon
which
already
he
felt
the
focus
of
multitudes
of
eyes
miss
winthrop
was
in
boston
now
and
it
was
during
these
early
march
days
that
bertram
was
supposed
to
be
putting
in
his
best
work
on
the
portrait
but
unfortunately
it
was
during
these
same
early
march
days
that
he
was
engaged
also
in
fashioning
the
thing
and
the
two
did
not
harmonize
the
thing
indeed
was
a
jealous
creature
and
would
brook
no
rival
she
filled
his
eyes
with
horrid
visions
and
his
brain
with
sickening
thoughts
between
him
and
his
model
she
flung
a
veil
of
fear
and
she
set
his
hand
to
trembling
and
his
brush
to
making
blunders
with
the
paints
on
his
palette
bertram
saw
the
thing
and
saw
too
the
grievous
result
of
her
presence
despairingly
he
fought
against
her
and
her
work
but
the
thing
had
become
full
grown
now
and
was
the
truth
hence
she
was
not
to
be
banished
she
even
in
a
taunting
way
seemed
sometimes
to
be
justifying
her
presence
for
she
reminded
him
after
all
what
the
difference
what
do
you
care
for
this
or
anything
again
if
billy
is
lost
to
you
but
the
artist
told
himself
fiercely
that
he
did
care
that
he
must
care
for
his
work
and
he
struggled
how
he
struggled
to
ignore
the
horrid
visions
and
the
sickening
thoughts
and
to
pierce
the
veil
of
fear
so
that
his
hand
might
be
steady
and
his
brush
regain
its
skill
and
so
he
worked
sometimes
he
let
his
work
remain
sometimes
one
hour
saw
only
the
erasing
of
what
the
hour
before
had
wrought
sometimes
the
elusive
something
in
marguerite
winthrop
face
seemed
right
at
the
tip
of
his
brush
on
the
canvas
even
he
saw
success
then
so
plainly
that
for
a
moment
it
almost
but
not
quite
blotted
out
the
thing
at
other
times
that
elusive
something
on
the
face
of
his
model
was
a
veritable
refusing
to
be
caught
and
held
even
in
his
eye
the
artist
knew
then
that
his
picture
would
be
hung
with
and
fullam
but
the
portrait
was
irrefutably
nearing
completion
and
it
was
to
be
exhibited
the
twentieth
of
the
month
bertram
knew
these
for
facts
chapter
xxviii
billy
takes
her
turn
if
for
billy
those
first
twenty
days
of
march
did
not
carry
quite
the
tragedy
they
contained
for
bertram
they
were
nevertheless
not
really
happy
ones
she
was
vaguely
troubled
by
a
curious
something
in
behavior
that
she
could
not
name
she
was
grieved
over
sorrow
and
she
was
constantly
probing
her
own
past
conduct
to
see
if
anywhere
she
could
find
that
she
was
to
blame
for
that
sorrow
she
missed
too
undeniably
arkwright
cheery
presence
and
the
charm
and
inspiration
of
his
music
nor
was
she
finding
it
easy
to
give
satisfactory
answers
to
the
questions
aunt
hannah
william
and
bertram
so
often
asked
her
as
to
where
mary
jane
was
even
her
music
was
little
comfort
to
her
these
days
she
was
not
writing
anything
there
was
no
song
in
her
heart
to
tempt
her
to
write
arkwright
new
words
that
he
had
brought
her
were
out
of
the
question
of
course
they
had
been
put
away
with
the
manuscript
of
the
completed
song
which
had
not
fortunately
gone
to
the
publishers
billy
had
waited
intending
to
send
them
together
she
was
so
glad
now
that
she
had
waited
just
once
since
arkwright
last
call
she
had
tried
to
sing
that
song
but
she
had
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
first
two
lines
the
full
meaning
of
those
words
as
coming
from
arkwright
had
swept
over
her
then
and
she
had
snatched
up
the
manuscript
and
hidden
it
under
the
bottom
pile
of
music
in
her
cabinet
and
she
had
presumed
to
sing
that
love
song
to
bertram
arkwright
had
written
billy
once
a
kind
courteous
manly
note
that
had
made
her
cry
he
had
begged
her
again
not
to
blame
herself
and
he
had
said
that
he
hoped
he
should
be
strong
enough
sometime
to
wish
to
call
occasionally
if
she
were
willing
and
renew
their
pleasant
hours
with
their
music
but
for
the
present
he
knew
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
stay
away
he
had
signed
himself
michael
jeremiah
arkwright
and
to
billy
that
was
the
most
pathetic
thing
in
the
letter
it
sounded
so
hopeless
and
dreary
to
one
who
knew
the
jaunty
m
alice
greggory
billy
saw
frequently
billy
and
aunt
hannah
were
great
friends
with
the
greggorys
now
and
had
been
ever
since
the
visit
at
hillside
the
cheery
little
cripple
with
the
gentle
tap
tap
tap
of
her
crutches
had
won
everybody
heart
the
very
first
day
and
alice
was
scarcely
less
of
a
favorite
after
the
sunny
friendliness
of
hillside
had
thawed
her
stiff
reserve
into
naturalness
billy
had
little
to
say
to
alice
greggory
of
arkwright
billy
was
no
longer
trying
to
play
cupid
assistant
the
cause
for
which
she
had
so
valiantly
worked
had
been
felled
by
arkwright
own
hand
but
that
there
were
still
some
faint
stirrings
of
life
in
it
was
evidenced
by
billy
secret
delight
when
one
day
alice
greggory
chanced
to
mention
that
arkwright
had
called
the
night
before
upon
her
and
her
mother
he
brought
us
news
of
our
old
home
she
explained
a
little
hurriedly
to
billy
he
had
heard
from
his
mother
and
he
thought
some
things
she
said
would
be
interesting
to
of
course
murmured
billy
carefully
excluding
from
her
voice
any
hint
of
the
delight
she
felt
but
hoping
all
the
while
that
alice
would
continue
the
subject
alice
however
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
billy
was
left
in
entire
ignorance
of
what
the
news
was
that
arkwright
had
brought
she
suspected
though
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
father
certainly
she
hoped
that
it
had
for
if
arkwright
had
called
to
tell
it
it
must
be
good
billy
had
found
a
new
home
for
the
greggorys
although
at
first
they
had
drawn
sensitively
back
and
had
said
that
they
preferred
to
remain
where
they
were
they
had
later
gratefully
accepted
it
a
little
couple
from
south
boston
to
whom
billy
had
given
a
two
weeks
outing
the
summer
before
had
moved
into
town
and
taken
a
flat
in
the
south
end
they
had
two
extra
rooms
which
they
had
told
billy
they
would
like
to
let
for
light
if
only
they
knew
just
the
right
people
to
take
into
such
close
quarters
with
themselves
billy
at
once
thought
of
the
greggorys
and
spoke
of
them
the
little
couple
were
delighted
and
the
greggorys
were
scarcely
less
so
when
they
at
last
became
convinced
that
only
a
very
little
more
money
than
they
were
already
paying
would
give
themselves
a
much
pleasanter
home
and
would
at
the
same
time
be
a
real
boon
to
two
young
people
who
were
trying
to
meet
expenses
so
the
change
was
made
and
general
happiness
all
round
had
resulted
so
much
so
that
bertram
had
said
to
billy
when
he
heard
of
it
it
looks
as
if
this
was
a
case
where
your
cake
is
frosted
on
both
nonsense
this
is
frosting
it
business
billy
had
laughed
and
the
new
pupils
you
have
found
for
miss
alice
they
business
too
i
suppose
certainly
retorted
billy
with
decision
then
she
had
given
a
low
laugh
and
said
mercy
if
alice
greggory
thought
it
was
anything
business
i
verily
believe
she
would
refuse
every
one
of
the
new
pupils
and
begin
to
carry
back
the
tables
and
chairs
herself
to
those
wretched
rooms
she
left
last
month
bertram
had
smiled
but
the
smile
had
been
a
fleeting
one
and
the
brooding
look
of
gloom
that
billy
had
noticed
so
frequently
of
late
had
come
back
to
his
eyes
billy
was
not
a
little
disturbed
over
bertram
these
days
he
did
not
seem
to
be
his
natural
cheery
self
at
all
he
talked
little
and
what
he
did
say
seldom
showed
a
trace
of
his
usually
whimsical
way
of
putting
things
he
was
kindness
itself
to
her
and
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
please
her
in
every
way
but
she
frequently
found
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
a
sombre
questioning
that
almost
frightened
her
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
she
wondered
what
the
question
was
that
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
and
whether
it
was
of
herself
or
himself
that
he
would
ask
it
if
he
did
dare
then
with
benumbing
force
one
day
a
possible
solution
of
the
mystery
came
to
her
he
had
found
out
that
it
was
true
what
all
his
friends
had
declared
of
him
he
did
not
really
love
any
girl
except
to
paint
the
minute
this
thought
came
to
her
billy
thrust
it
indignantly
away
it
was
disloyal
to
bertram
and
unworthy
of
herself
even
to
think
such
a
thing
she
told
herself
then
that
it
was
only
the
portrait
of
miss
winthrop
that
was
troubling
him
she
knew
that
he
was
worried
over
that
he
had
confessed
to
her
that
actually
sometimes
he
was
beginning
to
fear
his
hand
had
lost
its
cunning
as
if
that
were
not
enough
to
bring
the
gloom
to
any
man
face
to
any
artist
no
sooner
however
had
billy
arrived
at
this
point
in
her
mental
argument
than
a
new
element
entered
her
old
lurking
jealousy
of
which
she
was
heartily
ashamed
but
which
she
had
never
yet
been
able
quite
to
subdue
her
jealousy
of
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
beautiful
name
not
billy
whose
portrait
had
needed
so
much
time
and
so
many
sittings
to
finish
what
if
bertram
had
found
that
he
loved
what
if
that
were
why
his
hand
had
lost
its
cunning
because
though
loving
her
he
realized
that
he
was
bound
to
another
billy
herself
this
thought
too
billy
cast
from
her
at
once
as
again
disloyal
and
unworthy
but
both
thoughts
having
once
entered
her
brain
had
made
for
themselves
roads
over
which
the
second
passing
was
much
easier
than
the
first
as
billy
found
to
her
sorrow
certainly
as
the
days
went
by
and
as
bertram
face
and
manner
became
more
and
more
a
tragedy
of
suffering
billy
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
keep
those
thoughts
from
wearing
their
roads
of
suspicion
into
horrid
deep
ruts
of
certainty
only
with
william
and
marie
now
could
billy
escape
from
it
all
with
william
she
sought
new
curios
and
catalogued
the
old
with
marie
she
beat
eggs
and
whipped
cream
in
the
shining
kitchen
and
tried
to
think
that
nothing
in
the
world
mattered
except
that
the
cake
in
the
oven
should
not
fall
chapter
xxix
kate
writes
a
letter
bertram
feared
that
he
knew
before
the
portrait
was
hung
that
it
was
a
failure
he
was
sure
that
he
knew
it
on
the
evening
of
the
twentieth
when
he
encountered
the
swiftly
averted
eyes
of
some
of
his
artist
friends
and
saw
the
perplexed
frown
on
the
faces
of
others
but
he
knew
afterwards
that
he
did
not
really
know
it
till
he
read
the
newspapers
during
the
next
few
days
there
was
praise
oh
yes
the
faint
praise
that
kills
there
was
some
adverse
criticism
too
but
it
was
of
the
light
insincere
variety
that
is
given
to
mediocre
work
by
unimportant
artists
then
here
and
there
appeared
the
signed
critiques
of
the
men
whose
opinion
counted
and
bertram
knew
that
he
had
failed
neither
as
a
work
of
art
nor
as
a
likeness
was
the
portrait
the
success
that
henshaw
former
work
would
seem
to
indicate
that
it
should
have
been
indeed
as
one
caustic
pen
put
it
if
this
were
to
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
what
was
to
follow
then
the
famous
originator
of
the
face
of
a
girl
had
a
most
distinguished
future
behind
seldom
if
ever
before
had
an
exhibited
portrait
attracted
so
much
attention
as
bertram
had
said
uncounted
eyes
were
watching
for
it
before
it
was
hung
because
it
was
a
portrait
of
the
noted
beauty
marguerite
winthrop
and
because
two
other
artists
had
failed
where
he
bertram
henshaw
was
hoping
to
succeed
after
it
was
hung
and
the
uncounted
eyes
had
seen
it
either
literally
or
through
the
eyes
of
the
critics
interest
seemed
rather
to
grow
than
to
lessen
for
other
uncounted
eyes
wanted
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
anyway
and
when
these
eyes
had
seen
their
owners
talked
nor
did
they
by
any
means
all
talk
against
the
portrait
some
were
as
loud
in
its
praise
as
were
others
in
its
condemnation
all
of
which
of
course
but
helped
to
attract
more
eyes
to
the
cause
of
it
all
for
bertram
and
his
friends
these
days
were
naturally
trying
ones
william
finally
dreaded
to
open
his
newspaper
it
had
become
the
fashion
when
murders
and
divorces
were
scarce
occasionally
to
feature
somebody
opinion
of
the
henshaw
portrait
on
the
first
page
something
that
had
almost
never
been
known
to
happen
before
cyril
according
to
marie
played
perfectly
awful
things
on
his
piano
every
day
aunt
hannah
had
said
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
so
many
times
that
it
melted
now
into
a
wordless
groan
whenever
a
new
unfriendly
criticism
of
the
portrait
met
her
indignant
eyes
of
all
bertram
friends
billy
perhaps
not
unnaturally
was
the
angriest
not
only
did
she
after
a
time
refuse
to
read
the
papers
but
she
refused
even
to
allow
certain
ones
to
be
brought
into
the
house
foolish
and
unreasonable
as
she
knew
this
to
be
as
to
the
artist
himself
bertram
face
showed
drawn
lines
and
his
eyes
sombre
shadows
but
his
words
and
manner
carried
a
stolid
indifference
that
to
billy
was
at
once
heartbreaking
and
maddening
but
bertram
why
do
you
do
something
why
do
you
say
something
why
do
you
act
something
she
burst
out
one
day
the
artist
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
my
dear
what
can
i
say
or
do
or
act
he
asked
i
do
know
of
course
sighed
billy
but
i
know
what
i
like
to
do
i
should
like
to
go
out
and
fight
somebody
so
fierce
were
words
and
manner
coupled
as
they
were
with
a
pair
of
gentle
eyes
ablaze
and
two
soft
little
hands
doubled
into
menacing
fists
that
bertram
laughed
what
a
fiery
little
champion
it
is
to
be
sure
he
said
tenderly
but
as
if
fighting
could
do
any
good
in
this
case
billy
tense
muscles
relaxed
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
no
i
do
suppose
it
would
she
choked
beginning
to
cry
so
that
bertram
had
to
turn
comforter
come
come
dear
he
begged
do
take
it
so
to
heart
it
not
so
bad
after
all
i
still
my
good
right
hand
left
and
we
hope
there
something
in
it
yet
that
be
worth
but
one
is
bad
stormed
billy
it
splendid
i
sure
i
think
it
a
portrait
and
i
do
see
people
mean
by
talking
so
about
it
bertram
shook
his
head
his
eyes
grew
sombre
again
thank
you
dear
but
i
know
and
you
know
really
that
it
is
a
splendid
portrait
i
done
lots
better
work
than
then
why
do
they
look
at
those
and
let
this
alone
wailed
billy
with
indignation
because
i
deliberately
put
up
this
for
them
to
see
smiled
the
artist
wearily
billy
sighed
and
twisted
in
her
chair
what
does
winthrop
say
she
asked
at
last
in
a
faint
voice
bertram
lifted
his
head
mr
winthrop
been
a
trump
all
through
dear
he
already
insisted
on
paying
for
this
and
he
ordered
another
yes
the
old
fellow
never
minces
his
words
as
you
may
know
he
came
to
me
one
day
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
tersely
you
give
me
another
same
terms
go
in
boy
and
win
show
i
lost
the
first
ten
thousand
i
made
i
did
the
next
that
all
he
said
before
i
could
even
choke
out
an
answer
he
was
gone
gorry
talk
about
his
having
a
of
stone
i
do
believe
another
man
in
the
country
would
have
done
that
and
done
it
in
the
way
he
did
in
the
face
of
all
this
talk
finished
bertram
his
eyes
luminous
with
feeling
billy
hesitated
perhaps
his
daughter
influenced
him
perhaps
nodded
bertram
she
too
has
been
very
kind
all
the
way
billy
hesitated
again
but
i
thought
it
was
going
so
splendidly
she
faltered
in
a
voice
so
it
was
at
the
then
what
ailed
it
at
the
last
do
you
suppose
billy
was
holding
her
breath
till
he
should
answer
the
man
got
to
his
feet
billy
do
do
ask
me
he
begged
please
do
let
talk
of
it
any
more
it
ca
do
any
good
i
just
flunked
that
all
my
hand
failed
me
maybe
i
tried
too
hard
maybe
i
was
tired
maybe
something
troubled
me
never
mind
dear
what
it
was
it
can
do
no
good
even
to
think
of
that
now
so
just
let
drop
it
please
dear
he
finished
his
face
working
with
emotion
and
billy
dropped
it
so
far
as
words
were
concerned
but
she
could
not
drop
it
from
her
thoughts
specially
after
kate
letter
came
kate
letter
was
addressed
to
billy
and
it
said
after
speaking
of
various
other
matters
and
now
about
poor
bertram
billy
frowned
in
presence
no
one
was
allowed
to
say
bertram
failure
but
a
letter
has
a
most
annoying
privilege
of
saying
what
it
pleases
without
let
or
hindrance
unless
one
tears
it
up
and
a
letter
destroyed
unread
remains
always
such
a
tantalizing
mystery
of
possibilities
so
billy
let
the
letter
talk
of
course
we
have
heard
of
it
away
out
here
i
do
wish
if
bertram
paint
such
famous
people
he
would
manage
to
flatter
them
up
in
the
painting
i
mean
of
course
enough
so
that
it
might
pass
for
a
success
the
technical
part
of
all
this
criticism
i
do
pretend
to
understand
in
the
least
but
from
what
i
hear
and
read
he
must
indeed
have
made
a
terrible
mess
of
it
and
of
course
i
very
sorry
and
some
surprised
too
for
usually
he
paints
such
pretty
pictures
still
on
the
other
hand
billy
i
not
surprised
william
says
that
bertram
has
been
completely
out
of
fix
over
something
and
as
gloomy
as
an
owl
for
weeks
past
and
of
course
under
those
circumstances
the
poor
boy
could
not
be
expected
to
do
good
work
now
william
being
a
man
is
not
supposed
to
understand
what
the
trouble
is
but
i
being
a
woman
can
see
through
a
pane
of
glass
when
it
held
right
up
before
me
and
i
can
guess
of
course
that
a
woman
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
she
always
is
and
that
you
being
his
special
fancy
at
the
moment
billy
almost
did
tear
the
letter
now
but
not
quite
are
that
woman
now
billy
you
do
like
such
frank
talk
of
course
but
on
the
other
hand
i
know
you
do
not
want
to
ruin
the
dear
boy
career
so
for
heaven
sake
if
you
two
have
been
having
one
of
those
quarrels
that
lovers
so
delight
in
do
please
for
the
good
of
the
cause
make
up
quick
or
else
quarrel
harder
and
break
it
off
entirely
which
honestly
would
be
the
better
way
i
think
all
around
there
there
my
dear
child
do
bristle
up
i
am
very
fond
of
you
and
would
dearly
love
to
have
you
for
a
sister
if
you
only
take
william
as
you
should
but
as
you
very
well
know
i
never
did
approve
of
this
last
match
at
all
for
either
of
your
sakes
he
ca
make
you
happy
my
dear
and
you
ca
make
him
happy
bertram
never
was
and
never
will
be
a
marrying
man
he
too
temperamental
too
thoroughly
wrapped
up
in
his
art
girls
have
never
meant
anything
to
him
but
a
beautiful
picture
to
paint
and
they
never
will
they
ca
he
made
that
way
listen
i
can
prove
it
to
you
up
to
this
winter
he
always
been
a
happy
jolly
fellow
and
you
what
beautiful
work
he
has
done
never
before
has
he
tied
himself
to
any
one
girl
till
last
fall
then
you
two
entered
into
this
absurd
engagement
now
what
has
it
been
since
william
wrote
me
himself
not
a
fortnight
ago
that
he
been
worried
to
death
over
bertram
for
weeks
past
he
been
so
moody
so
irritable
so
fretted
over
his
work
so
unlike
himself
and
his
picture
has
dismally
of
course
william
does
understand
but
i
do
i
know
you
probably
quarrelled
or
something
you
know
how
flighty
and
unreliable
you
can
be
sometimes
billy
and
i
do
say
that
to
mean
anything
against
you
either
way
you
just
as
temperamental
in
your
art
music
as
bertram
is
in
his
you
utterly
unsuited
to
him
if
bertram
is
to
marry
it
should
be
some
quiet
staid
sensible
girl
who
would
be
a
to
him
but
when
i
think
of
you
two
flyaway
flutterbudgets
marrying
now
for
heaven
sake
billy
make
up
or
something
and
do
it
now
do
for
pity
sake
let
bertram
ever
put
out
another
such
a
piece
of
work
to
shame
us
all
like
this
do
you
want
to
ruin
his
career
faithfully
yours
kate
hartwell
p
think
william
the
one
for
you
he
devoted
to
you
and
his
quiet
sensible
affection
is
just
what
your
temperament
needs
i
thought
william
was
the
one
for
you
think
it
over
p
no
you
can
see
by
the
above
that
it
is
you
i
objecting
to
my
dear
it
just
chapter
xxx
i
hindered
him
billy
was
shaking
with
anger
and
terror
by
the
time
she
had
finished
reading
kate
letter
anger
was
uppermost
at
the
moment
and
with
one
sweeping
wrench
of
her
trembling
fingers
she
tore
the
closely
written
sheets
straight
through
the
middle
and
flung
them
into
the
little
wicker
basket
by
her
desk
then
she
went
and
played
her
noisiest
merriest
tarantella
and
tried
to
see
how
fast
she
could
make
her
fingers
fly
but
billy
could
not
of
course
play
tarantellas
all
day
and
even
while
she
did
play
them
she
could
not
forget
that
and
the
horror
it
contained
the
anger
was
still
uppermost
but
the
terror
was
prodding
her
at
every
turn
and
demanding
to
know
just
what
it
was
that
kate
had
written
in
that
letter
anyway
it
is
not
strange
then
perhaps
that
before
two
hours
passed
billy
went
took
the
letter
from
the
basket
matched
together
the
torn
and
forced
her
shrinking
eyes
to
read
every
word
to
satisfy
that
terror
which
would
not
be
silenced
at
the
end
of
the
second
reading
billy
reminded
herself
with
stern
calmness
that
it
was
only
kate
after
all
that
nobody
ought
to
mind
what
kate
said
that
certainly
billy
ought
not
after
the
experience
she
had
already
had
with
her
unpleasant
interference
kate
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
anyway
this
was
only
another
case
of
her
trying
to
she
did
so
love
to
manage
everything
at
this
point
billy
got
out
her
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
to
kate
it
was
a
formal
cold
little
letter
not
at
all
the
sort
that
friends
usually
received
it
thanked
kate
for
her
advice
and
for
her
kind
willingness
to
have
billy
for
a
sister
but
it
hinted
that
perhaps
kate
did
not
realize
that
as
long
as
billy
was
the
one
who
would
have
to
with
the
chosen
man
it
would
be
pleasanter
to
take
the
one
billy
loved
which
happened
in
this
case
to
be
bertram
not
william
as
for
any
quarrel
being
the
cause
of
whatever
fancied
trouble
there
was
with
the
new
picture
the
letter
scouted
that
idea
in
no
uncertain
terms
there
had
been
no
suggestion
of
a
quarrel
even
once
since
the
engagement
then
billy
signed
her
name
and
took
the
letter
out
to
post
immediately
for
the
first
few
minutes
after
the
letter
had
been
dropped
into
the
green
box
at
the
corner
billy
held
her
head
high
and
told
herself
that
the
matter
was
now
closed
she
had
sent
kate
a
courteous
dignified
conclusive
effectual
answer
and
she
thought
with
much
satisfaction
of
the
things
she
had
said
very
soon
however
she
began
to
think
not
so
much
of
what
had
said
but
of
what
kate
had
said
many
of
kate
sentences
were
unpleasantly
vivid
in
her
mind
they
seemed
indeed
to
stand
out
in
letters
of
flame
and
they
began
to
burn
and
burn
and
burn
these
were
some
of
them
william
says
that
bertram
has
been
completely
out
of
fix
over
something
and
as
gloomy
as
an
owl
for
weeks
a
woman
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
you
are
that
you
ca
make
him
bertram
never
was
and
never
will
be
a
marrying
girls
have
never
meant
anything
to
him
but
a
beautiful
picture
to
paint
and
they
never
up
to
this
winter
he
always
been
a
carefree
happy
jolly
fellow
and
you
what
beautiful
work
he
has
done
never
before
has
he
tied
himself
to
any
one
girl
until
last
now
what
has
it
been
since
he
been
so
moody
so
irritable
so
fretted
over
his
work
so
unlike
himself
and
his
picture
has
failed
do
you
want
to
ruin
his
career
billy
began
to
see
now
that
she
had
not
really
answered
kate
letter
at
all
the
matter
was
not
closed
her
reply
had
been
perhaps
courteous
and
dignified
but
it
had
not
been
conclusive
nor
effectual
billy
had
reached
home
now
and
she
was
crying
bertram
acted
strangely
of
late
bertram
seemed
troubled
over
something
his
picture
with
a
little
shudder
billy
tossed
aside
these
thoughts
and
dug
at
her
teary
eyes
with
a
determined
hand
fiercely
she
told
herself
that
the
matter
settled
very
scornfully
she
declared
that
it
was
only
kate
after
all
and
that
she
let
kate
make
her
unhappy
again
forthwith
she
picked
up
a
current
magazine
and
began
to
read
as
it
chanced
however
even
here
billy
found
no
peace
for
the
first
article
she
opened
to
was
headed
in
huge
black
type
marriage
and
the
artistic
with
a
little
cry
billy
flung
the
magazine
far
from
her
and
picked
up
another
but
even
the
elusiveness
of
chopin
which
she
found
here
could
not
keep
her
thoughts
nor
her
eyes
from
wandering
to
the
discarded
thing
in
the
corner
lying
ignominiously
face
down
with
crumpled
leaves
billy
knew
that
in
the
end
she
should
go
over
and
pick
that
magazine
up
and
read
that
article
from
beginning
to
end
she
was
not
surprised
therefore
when
she
did
it
but
she
was
not
any
the
happier
for
having
done
it
the
writer
of
the
article
did
not
approve
of
marriage
and
the
artistic
temperament
he
said
the
artist
belonged
to
his
art
and
to
posterity
through
his
art
the
essay
fairly
bristled
with
words
and
phrases
few
of
which
billy
really
understood
she
did
understand
enough
however
to
feel
guiltily
when
the
thing
was
finished
that
already
she
had
married
bertram
and
by
so
doing
had
committed
a
crime
she
had
slain
art
stifled
ambition
destroyed
inspiration
and
been
a
nuisance
generally
in
consequence
of
which
bertram
would
henceforth
and
forevermore
be
doomed
to
littleness
naturally
in
this
state
of
mind
and
with
this
vision
before
her
billy
was
anything
but
her
bright
easy
self
when
she
met
bertram
an
hour
or
two
later
naturally
too
bertram
still
the
tormented
victim
of
the
bugaboo
his
jealous
fears
had
fashioned
was
just
in
the
mood
to
place
the
worst
possible
construction
on
his
sweetheart
very
evident
unhappiness
with
sighs
unspoken
questions
and
frequently
averted
eyes
therefore
the
wretched
evening
passed
a
pitiful
misery
to
them
both
during
the
days
that
followed
billy
thought
that
the
world
itself
must
be
in
league
with
kate
so
often
did
she
encounter
kate
letter
masquerading
under
some
thin
disguise
she
did
not
stop
to
realize
that
because
she
was
so
afraid
she
find
it
she
find
it
in
the
books
she
read
in
the
plays
she
saw
in
the
chance
words
she
heard
spoken
by
friend
or
stranger
always
there
was
something
to
feed
her
fears
in
one
way
or
another
even
in
a
yellowed
newspaper
that
had
covered
the
top
shelf
in
her
closet
she
found
one
day
a
symposium
on
whether
or
not
an
artist
wife
should
be
an
artist
and
she
shuddered
but
she
read
every
opinion
given
some
writers
said
no
and
some
yes
and
some
said
it
all
depended
on
the
artist
and
his
wife
billy
found
much
food
for
thought
some
for
amusement
and
a
little
that
made
for
peace
of
mind
on
the
whole
it
opened
up
a
new
phase
of
the
matter
perhaps
at
all
events
upon
finishing
it
she
almost
sobbed
one
would
think
that
just
because
i
write
a
song
now
and
then
i
was
going
to
let
bertram
starve
and
go
with
holes
in
his
socks
and
no
buttons
on
his
clothes
it
was
that
afternoon
that
billy
went
to
see
marie
but
even
there
she
did
not
escape
for
the
gentle
marie
all
unknowingly
added
her
mite
to
the
woeful
whole
billy
found
marie
in
tears
why
marie
she
cried
in
dismay
warned
marie
turning
agonized
eyes
toward
the
closed
door
of
cyril
den
but
dear
what
is
it
begged
billy
with
no
less
dismay
but
with
greater
caution
admonished
marie
again
on
tiptoe
then
she
led
the
way
to
a
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
tiny
apartment
once
there
she
explained
in
a
more
natural
tone
of
voice
cyril
at
work
on
a
new
piece
for
the
well
what
if
he
is
demanded
billy
that
need
make
you
cry
need
it
oh
no
no
indeed
demurred
marie
in
a
shocked
voice
well
then
what
is
it
marie
hesitated
then
with
the
abandon
of
a
hurt
child
that
longs
for
sympathy
she
sobbed
it
it
just
that
i
afraid
after
all
that
i
not
good
enough
for
billy
stared
frankly
not
enough
marie
henshaw
whatever
in
the
world
do
you
mean
well
not
good
him
then
listen
i
know
in
lots
of
ways
i
must
have
disappointed
him
first
he
put
on
some
socks
that
darned
they
were
the
first
since
our
marriage
that
i
found
to
darn
and
i
been
so
proud
and
and
happy
while
i
darning
them
but
but
he
took
off
right
after
breakfast
and
threw
in
a
corner
then
he
put
on
a
new
pair
and
said
that
i
i
need
darn
any
more
that
it
made
bunches
billy
darns
bunches
marie
face
and
voice
were
tragic
nonsense
dear
do
let
that
fret
you
comforted
billy
promptly
trying
not
to
laugh
too
hard
it
was
darns
it
was
just
darns
anybody
darns
cyril
wo
wear
darned
socks
aunt
hannah
told
me
so
long
ago
and
i
said
then
there
be
a
tragedy
when
found
it
out
so
do
worry
over
oh
but
that
is
all
moaned
marie
listen
you
know
how
quiet
he
must
have
everything
when
he
composing
and
he
ought
to
have
it
too
but
i
forgot
this
morning
and
put
on
some
old
shoes
that
did
have
any
rubber
heels
and
i
ran
the
carpet
sweeper
and
i
rattled
tins
in
the
kitchen
but
i
never
thought
a
thing
until
he
opened
his
door
and
asked
me
to
change
my
shoes
and
let
the
the
confounded
dirt
go
and
did
i
have
any
dishes
in
the
house
but
what
were
made
of
that
abominable
tin
she
finished
in
a
wail
of
misery
billy
burst
into
a
ringing
laugh
but
marie
aghast
face
and
upraised
hand
speedily
reduced
it
to
a
convulsive
giggle
you
dear
child
cyril
always
like
that
when
he
composing
soothed
billy
i
supposed
you
knew
it
dear
do
you
fret
run
along
and
make
him
his
favorite
pudding
and
by
night
both
of
you
will
have
forgotten
there
ever
were
such
things
in
the
world
as
tins
and
shoes
and
carpet
sweepers
that
marie
shook
her
head
her
dismal
face
did
not
relax
you
do
understand
she
moaned
it
myself
i
him
she
brought
out
the
word
with
an
agony
of
slow
horror
and
only
i
look
she
faltered
going
to
the
table
and
picking
up
with
shaking
hands
a
magazine
billy
recognized
it
by
the
cover
at
once
another
like
it
had
been
flung
not
so
long
ago
by
her
own
hand
into
the
corner
she
was
not
surprised
therefore
to
see
very
soon
at
the
end
of
marie
trembling
finger
marriage
and
the
artistic
billy
did
not
give
a
ringing
laugh
this
time
she
gave
an
involuntary
little
shudder
though
she
tried
valiantly
to
turn
it
all
off
with
a
light
word
of
scorn
and
a
cheery
pat
on
marie
heaving
shoulders
but
she
went
home
very
soon
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
her
visit
to
marie
had
not
brought
her
peace
billy
knew
kate
letter
by
heart
now
both
in
the
original
and
in
its
different
versions
and
she
knew
that
despite
her
struggles
she
was
being
forced
straight
toward
kate
own
verdict
that
she
billy
the
cause
in
some
way
of
the
deplorable
change
in
appearance
manner
and
work
before
she
would
quite
surrender
to
this
belief
however
she
determined
to
ask
bertram
himself
falteringly
but
resolutely
therefore
one
day
she
questioned
him
bertram
once
you
hinted
that
the
picture
did
not
go
right
because
you
were
troubled
over
something
and
i
been
wondering
was
it
about
me
in
any
way
that
you
were
troubled
billy
had
her
answer
before
the
man
spoke
she
had
it
in
the
quick
terror
that
sprang
to
his
eyes
and
the
dull
red
that
swept
from
his
neck
to
his
forehead
his
reply
so
far
as
words
went
did
not
count
for
it
evaded
everything
and
told
nothing
but
billy
knew
without
words
she
knew
too
what
she
must
do
for
the
time
being
she
took
evasive
answer
as
he
so
evidently
wished
it
to
be
taken
but
that
evening
after
he
had
gone
she
wrote
him
a
little
note
and
broke
the
engagement
so
heartbroken
was
she
and
so
fearful
was
she
that
he
should
suspect
this
that
her
note
when
completed
was
a
cold
little
thing
of
few
words
which
carried
no
hint
that
its
very
coldness
was
but
the
in
the
disguise
of
pride
this
was
like
billy
in
all
ways
billy
had
she
lived
in
the
days
of
the
christian
martyrs
would
have
been
the
first
to
walk
with
head
erect
into
the
arena
of
sacrifice
the
arena
now
was
just
everyday
living
the
lions
were
her
own
devouring
misery
and
the
cause
was
bertram
best
good
from
bertram
own
self
she
had
it
now
that
she
had
been
the
cause
of
his
being
troubled
so
she
could
doubt
no
longer
the
only
part
that
was
uncertain
was
the
reason
why
he
had
been
troubled
whether
his
bond
to
her
had
become
irksome
because
of
his
love
for
another
or
because
of
his
love
for
no
girl
except
to
paint
billy
did
not
know
but
that
it
was
irksome
she
did
not
doubt
now
besides
as
if
she
were
going
to
slay
his
art
stifle
his
ambition
destroy
his
inspiration
and
be
a
nuisance
generally
just
so
that
might
be
happy
indeed
no
hence
she
broke
the
engagement
this
was
the
letter
dear
bertram
you
wo
make
the
move
so
i
must
i
knew
from
the
way
you
spoke
that
it
about
me
that
you
were
troubled
even
though
you
generously
tried
to
make
me
think
it
was
not
and
so
the
picture
did
not
go
well
now
dear
we
have
not
been
happy
together
lately
you
have
seen
it
so
have
i
fear
our
engagement
was
a
mistake
so
i
going
to
send
back
your
ring
and
i
writing
this
letter
please
do
try
to
see
me
just
yet
you
what
i
am
doing
is
best
all
round
always
your
friend
chapter
xxxi
flight
billy
feared
if
she
did
not
mail
the
letter
at
once
she
would
not
have
the
courage
to
mail
it
at
all
so
she
slipped
very
quietly
and
went
herself
to
the
post
box
a
little
way
down
the
street
then
she
came
back
and
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
though
not
until
after
she
had
sobbed
awake
for
long
hours
of
wretchedness
when
she
awoke
in
the
morning
and
unrested
there
came
to
her
first
the
vague
horror
of
some
shadow
hanging
over
her
then
the
sickening
consciousness
of
what
that
shadow
was
for
one
wild
minute
billy
felt
that
she
must
run
to
the
telephone
summon
bertram
and
beseech
him
to
return
unread
the
letter
he
would
receive
from
her
that
day
then
there
came
to
her
the
memory
of
bertram
face
as
it
had
looked
the
night
before
when
she
had
asked
him
if
she
were
the
cause
of
his
being
troubled
there
came
too
the
memory
of
kate
scathing
do
you
want
to
ruin
his
career
even
the
hated
magazine
article
and
marie
tragic
i
him
added
their
mite
and
billy
knew
that
she
should
not
go
to
the
telephone
nor
summon
bertram
the
one
fatal
mistake
now
would
be
to
let
bertram
see
her
own
distress
if
once
he
should
suspect
how
she
suffered
in
doing
this
thing
there
would
be
a
scene
that
billy
felt
she
had
not
the
courage
to
face
she
must
therefore
manage
in
some
way
not
to
see
bertram
not
to
let
him
see
her
until
she
felt
more
sure
of
her
no
matter
what
he
said
the
easiest
way
to
do
this
was
of
course
to
go
away
but
where
how
she
must
think
meanwhile
for
these
first
few
hours
she
would
not
tell
any
one
even
aunt
hannah
what
had
happened
there
must
speak
to
her
of
it
yet
that
she
could
not
endure
aunt
hannah
would
of
course
shiver
groan
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
and
call
for
another
shawl
and
billy
just
now
felt
as
if
she
should
scream
if
she
heard
aunt
hannah
say
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
over
that
billy
went
down
to
breakfast
therefore
with
a
determination
to
act
exactly
as
usual
so
that
aunt
hannah
should
not
know
yet
when
people
try
to
act
exactly
as
usual
they
generally
end
in
acting
quite
the
opposite
and
billy
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
hence
her
attempted
cheerfulness
became
flippantness
and
her
laughter
giggles
that
rang
too
frequently
to
be
quite
sincere
though
from
aunt
hannah
it
all
elicited
only
an
affectionate
smile
at
the
dear
child
high
a
little
later
when
aunt
hannah
was
glancing
over
the
morning
paper
now
no
longer
barred
from
the
door
she
gave
a
sudden
cry
billy
just
listen
to
this
she
exclaimed
reading
from
the
paper
in
her
hand
new
tenor
in
the
girl
of
the
golden
appearance
of
arkwright
at
the
boston
opera
house
owing
to
the
sudden
illness
of
dubassi
who
was
to
have
taken
the
part
of
johnson
tonight
an
exceptional
opportunity
has
come
to
a
young
tenor
singer
one
of
the
most
promising
pupils
at
the
conservatory
school
arkwright
is
said
to
have
a
fine
voice
a
particularly
good
stage
presence
and
a
purity
of
tone
and
smoothness
of
execution
that
few
of
his
age
and
experience
can
show
only
a
short
time
ago
he
appeared
as
the
duke
at
one
of
the
saturday
night
performances
of
rigoletto
and
his
extraordinary
success
on
that
occasion
coupled
with
his
familiarity
with
and
fitness
for
the
part
of
johnson
in
the
girl
of
the
golden
west
led
to
his
being
chosen
to
take
dubassi
place
his
performance
is
awaited
with
the
greatest
of
interest
now
is
that
splendid
for
mary
jane
i
so
glad
beamed
aunt
hannah
of
course
we
glad
cried
billy
and
did
it
come
just
in
time
this
is
the
last
week
of
opera
anyway
you
but
it
says
he
sang
before
on
a
saturday
night
declared
aunt
hannah
going
back
to
the
paper
in
her
hand
now
would
you
have
thought
have
heard
of
it
or
read
of
it
and
would
you
have
thought
he
have
told
us
oh
well
maybe
he
did
happen
to
see
us
so
he
could
tell
us
returned
billy
with
elaborate
carelessness
i
know
it
but
it
so
funny
he
seen
us
contended
aunt
hannah
frowning
you
know
how
much
he
used
to
be
billy
colored
and
hurried
into
the
fray
oh
but
he
must
have
been
so
busy
with
all
this
you
know
and
of
course
we
did
see
it
in
the
paper
because
we
did
have
any
paper
at
that
time
probably
oh
yes
that
my
fault
i
know
she
laughed
and
i
was
silly
i
own
but
we
make
up
for
it
now
we
go
of
course
i
wish
it
had
been
on
our
regular
night
but
i
fancy
we
can
get
seats
somewhere
and
i
going
to
ask
alice
greggory
and
her
mother
too
i
go
down
there
this
morning
to
tell
them
and
to
get
the
tickets
i
got
it
all
billy
had
indeed
got
it
all
she
had
been
longing
for
something
that
would
take
her
away
from
the
house
and
if
possible
away
from
herself
this
would
do
the
one
easily
and
might
help
on
the
other
she
rose
at
once
i
go
right
away
she
said
but
my
dear
frowned
aunt
hannah
anxiously
i
do
believe
i
can
go
though
i
love
to
but
why
not
i
tired
and
half
sick
with
a
headache
this
morning
i
did
sleep
and
i
taken
cold
somewhere
sighed
the
lady
pulling
the
top
shawl
a
little
higher
about
her
throat
why
you
poor
dear
what
a
shame
wo
bertram
go
asked
aunt
hannah
billy
shook
her
head
but
she
did
not
meet
aunt
hannah
eyes
oh
no
i
even
ask
him
he
said
last
night
he
had
a
banquet
on
for
one
of
his
art
clubs
i
billy
voice
was
casualness
itself
but
you
have
the
greggorys
that
is
greggory
go
she
inquired
aunt
hannah
oh
yes
i
sure
she
can
nodded
billy
you
know
she
went
to
the
operetta
and
this
is
just
the
same
only
yes
yes
i
know
murmured
aunt
hannah
dear
me
how
can
she
get
about
so
on
those
two
wretched
little
sticks
she
a
perfect
marvel
to
she
is
to
me
too
sighed
billy
as
she
hurried
from
the
room
billy
was
indeed
in
a
hurry
to
herself
she
said
she
wanted
to
get
away
away
and
she
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
she
had
her
plans
all
made
she
would
go
first
to
the
greggorys
and
invite
them
to
attend
the
opera
with
her
that
evening
then
she
would
get
the
tickets
just
what
she
would
do
with
the
rest
of
the
day
she
did
not
know
she
knew
only
that
she
would
not
go
home
until
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
the
opera
she
did
not
tell
aunt
hannah
this
however
when
she
left
the
house
she
planned
to
telephone
it
from
somewhere
down
town
later
she
told
herself
that
she
stay
all
day
under
the
sharp
eyes
of
aunt
hannah
but
she
managed
nevertheless
to
bid
that
lady
a
particularly
blithe
and
billy
had
not
been
long
gone
when
the
telephone
bell
rang
aunt
hannah
answered
it
why
bertram
is
that
you
she
called
in
answer
to
the
words
that
came
to
her
across
the
wire
why
i
hardly
knew
your
voice
did
you
well
is
is
billy
there
no
she
is
she
gone
down
to
see
alice
oh
so
evident
was
the
disappointment
in
the
voice
that
aunt
hannah
added
hastily
i
so
sorry
she
has
been
gone
ten
minutes
but
is
there
any
message
no
thank
you
there
no
the
voice
hesitated
then
went
on
a
little
constrainedly
how
how
is
billy
this
morning
she
she
all
right
is
she
aunt
hannah
laughed
in
obvious
amusement

your
dear
heart

it

such
a
time
since
last
evening
when
you

i
was
thinking
at
the
breakfast
table
how
pretty
she
looked
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
her
bright
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
in
such
high
an
inarticulate
something
that
aunt
hannah
could
not
quite
catch
came
across
the
line
then
a
somewhat
hurried
all
right
thank

the
next
time

to
the

little
i
that
good
wo
you
repent
and
go
too
no
oh
no
indeed
all
right
then
i
sorry
so
sighed
aunt
hannah
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
away
it
was
after
five
when
billy
got
home
and
so
hurried
were
the
dressing
and
the
dinner
that
aunt
hannah
forgot
to
mention
telephone
call
till
just
as
billy
was
ready
to
start
for
the
greggorys
there
and
i
forgot
she
confessed
bertram
called
you
up
just
after
you
left
this
morning
my
did
he
billy
face
was
turned
away
but
aunt
hannah
did
not
notice
that
yes
oh
he
did
want
anything
special
smiled
the
lady
only
well
he
did
ask
if
you
were
all
right
this
morning
she
finished
with
quiet
mischief
did
he
murmured
billy
again
this
time
there
was
a
little
sound
after
the
words
which
aunt
hannah
would
have
taken
for
a
sob
if
she
had
not
known
that
it
must
have
been
a
laugh
then
billy
was
gone
at
eight
the
doorbell
rang
and
a
minute
later
rosa
came
up
to
say
that
bertram
henshaw
was
and
wished
to
see
stetson
stetson
went
down
at
once
why
my
dear
boy
she
exclaimed
as
she
entered
the
room
billy
said
you
had
a
banquet
on
for
yes
i
know
but
i
did
bertram
face
was
pale
and
drawn
his
voice
did
not
sound
natural
why
bertram
you
look
ill
you
ill
the
man
made
an
impatient
gesture
no
no
i
not
ill
i
not
ill
at
all
rosa
says
billy
not
no
she
gone
to
the
opera
with
the
the
there
was
a
grieved
hurt
in
bertram
voice
that
aunt
hannah
quite
misunderstood
she
hastened
to
give
an
apologetic
explanation
yes
she
would
have
told
you
she
would
have
asked
you
to
join
them
i
sure
but
she
said
you
were
going
to
a
banquet
i
she
said
yes
i
did
tell
her
so
last
night
nodded
bertram
dully
aunt
hannah
frowned
a
little
still
more
anxiously
she
endeavored
to
explain
to
this
disappointed
lover
why
his
sweetheart
was
not
at
home
to
greet
him
well
then
of
course
my
boy
she
never
think
of
your
coming
here
and
when
she
found
arkwright
was
going
to
sing
arkwright
there
was
no
listlessness
in
bertram
voice
or
manner
now
yes
did
you
see
it
in
the
paper
such
a
splendid
chance
for
him
his
picture
was
there
no
i
did
see
then
you
do
know
about
it
of
course
smiled
aunt
hannah
but
to
take
the
part
of
johnson
in
girl
of
the
golden
west
is
that
splendid
i
so
glad
and
billy
was
too
she
hurried
right
off
this
morning
to
get
the
tickets
and
to
ask
the
oh
bertram
got
to
his
feet
a
little
abruptly
and
held
out
his
hand
well
then
i
might
as
well
say
then
i
suppose
he
suggested
with
a
laugh
that
aunt
hannah
thought
was
a
bit
forced
before
she
could
remind
him
again
though
that
billy
was
really
not
to
blame
for
not
being
there
to
welcome
him
he
was
gone
and
aunt
hannah
could
only
go
and
meditate
on
the
unreasonableness
of
lovers
in
general
and
of
bertram
in
particular
aunt
hannah
had
gone
to
bed
but
she
was
still
awake
when
billy
came
home
so
she
heard
the
automobile
come
to
a
stop
before
the
door
and
she
called
to
billy
when
the
girl
came
upstairs
billy
dear
come
in
here
i
awake
i
want
to
hear
about
it
was
it
good
billy
stopped
in
the
doorway
the
light
from
the
hall
struck
her
face
there
was
no
brightness
in
her
eyes
now
no
pink
in
her
cheeks
oh
yes
it
was
good
very
good
she
replied
listlessly
why
billy
how
queer
you
answer
what
was
the
matter
was
mary
jane
all
right
mary
jane
oh
oh
yes
he
was
very
good
aunt
good
indeed
echoed
the
lady
indignantly
he
must
have
been
when
you
speak
as
if
you
actually
forgotten
that
he
sang
at
all
anyway
billy
had
forgotten
almost
billy
had
found
that
in
spite
of
her
getting
away
from
the
house
she
had
not
got
away
from
herself
once
all
day
she
tried
now
however
to
summon
her
acting
powers
of
the
morning
but
it
was
splendid
really
aunt
hannah
she
cried
with
some
show
of
animation
and
they
clapped
and
cheered
and
gave
him
any
number
of
curtain
calls
we
were
so
proud
of
him
but
you
see
i
tired
she
broke
off
wearily
you
poor
child
of
course
you
are
and
you
look
like
a
ghost
i
keep
you
another
minute
run
along
to
bed
oh
bertram
did
go
to
that
banquet
after
all
he
came
here
she
added
as
billy
turned
to
go
bertram
the
girl
wheeled
sharply
yes
he
wanted
you
of
course
i
found
i
did
do
at
all
chuckled
aunt
hannah
did
you
suppose
i
would
there
was
no
answer
billy
had
gone
in
the
long
night
watches
billy
fought
it
out
with
herself
billy
had
always
fought
things
out
with
herself
she
must
go
away
she
knew
that
already
bertram
had
telephoned
and
called
he
evidently
meant
to
see
her
and
she
could
not
see
him
she
dared
not
if
she
did
billy
knew
now
how
pitifully
little
it
would
take
to
make
her
actually
to
slay
bertram
art
stifle
his
ambition
destroy
his
inspiration
and
be
a
nuisance
generally
if
only
she
could
have
bertram
while
she
was
doing
it
all
sternly
then
she
asked
herself
if
she
had
no
pride
if
she
had
forgotten
that
it
was
because
of
her
that
the
winthrop
portrait
had
not
been
a
success
because
of
her
either
for
the
reason
that
he
loved
now
miss
winthrop
or
else
that
he
loved
no
girl
except
to
paint
very
early
in
the
morning
a
billy
appeared
at
aunt
hannah
bedside
billy
exclaimed
aunt
hannah
plainly
appalled
billy
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
aunt
hannah
she
began
in
a
monotonous
voice
as
if
she
were
reciting
a
lesson
she
had
learned
by
heart
please
listen
and
please
try
not
to
be
too
surprised
you
were
saying
the
other
day
that
you
would
like
to
visit
your
old
home
town
well
i
think
that
a
very
nice
idea
if
you
do
mind
we
go
aunt
hannah
pulled
herself
half
erect
in
bed
child
yes
nodded
billy
unsmilingly
we
shall
have
to
go
somewhere
and
i
thought
you
would
like
that
place
but
billy
what
does
this
mean
billy
sighed
heavily
yes
i
understand
you
have
to
know
the
rest
of
course
i
broken
my
engagement
i
do
want
to
see
bertram
that
why
i
going
aunt
hannah
fell
nervelessly
back
on
the
pillow
her
teeth
fairly
chattered
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
wo
you
please
pull
up
that
blanket
she
moaned
billy
what
do
you
mean
billy
shook
her
head
and
got
to
her
feet
i
ca
tell
any
more
now
really
aunt
hannah
please
do
ask
me
and
do
talk
you
go
with
me
wo
you
and
aunt
hannah
with
her
terrified
eyes
on
billy
piteously
agitated
face
nodded
her
head
and
choked
why
of
course
i
go
anywhere
with
you
billy
but
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
do
it
a
little
later
billy
in
her
own
room
wrote
this
note
to
bertram
dear
bertram
i
going
away
that
be
best
all
around
you
agree
to
that
i
sure
please
do
try
to
see
me
and
please
do
write
it
would
make
either
one
of
us
any
happier
you
must
know
that
as
ever
your
friend
bertram
when
he
read
it
grew
only
a
shade
more
white
a
degree
more
sick
at
heart
then
he
kissed
the
letter
gently
and
put
it
away
with
the
other
to
bertram
the
thing
was
very
clear
billy
had
come
now
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
give
herself
where
she
could
not
give
her
heart
and
in
this
he
agreed
with
her
bitter
as
it
was
for
him
certainly
he
did
not
want
billy
if
billy
did
not
want
him
he
told
himself
he
would
now
of
course
accede
to
her
request
he
would
not
write
to
her
and
make
her
suffer
more
but
to
bertram
at
that
moment
it
seemed
that
the
very
sun
in
the
heavens
had
gone
out
chapter
xxxii
pete
to
the
rescue
one
by
one
the
weeks
passed
and
became
a
month
then
other
weeks
became
other
months
it
was
july
when
billy
homesick
and
weary
came
back
to
hillside
with
aunt
hannah
home
looked
wonderfully
good
to
billy
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
so
dreaded
to
see
it
billy
had
made
up
her
mind
however
that
come
sometime
she
must
she
could
not
of
course
stay
always
away
perhaps
too
it
would
be
just
as
easy
at
home
as
it
was
away
certainly
it
could
not
be
any
harder
she
was
convinced
of
that
besides
she
did
not
want
bertram
to
think
billy
had
received
only
meagre
news
from
boston
since
she
went
away
bertram
had
not
written
at
all
william
had
written
twice
hurt
grieved
puzzled
questioning
letters
that
were
very
hard
to
answer
from
marie
too
had
come
letters
of
much
the
same
sort
by
far
the
cheeriest
epistles
had
come
from
alice
greggory
they
contained
indeed
about
the
only
comfort
billy
had
known
for
weeks
for
they
showed
very
plainly
to
billy
that
arkwright
heart
had
been
caught
on
the
rebound
and
that
in
alice
greggory
he
was
finding
the
sweetest
sort
of
balm
for
his
wounded
feelings
from
these
letters
billy
learned
too
that
judge
greggory
honor
had
been
wholly
vindicated
and
as
billy
told
aunt
hannah
anybody
could
put
two
and
two
together
and
make
four
it
was
eight
on
a
rainy
july
evening
that
billy
and
aunt
hannah
arrived
at
hillside
and
it
was
only
a
little
past
eight
that
aunt
hannah
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
when
she
came
back
to
billy
she
was
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
billy
sprang
to
her
feet
why
aunt
hannah
what
is
it
what
the
matter
she
demanded
aunt
hannah
sank
into
a
chair
still
wringing
her
hands
oh

billy

can
i
tell
you
how
can

tell
you

moaned

to
what
is
it
aunt
hannah
it
bertram
billy
face
grew
ashen
quick
quick
what
do
you
mean
for
answer
aunt
hannah
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
began
to
sob
aloud
billy
almost
beside
herself
now
with
terror
and
anxiety
dropped
on
her
knees
and
tried
to
pull
away
the
shaking
hands
aunt
hannah
you
must
tell
me
you
must
you
must
i
ca
billy
it
bertram
he
choked
aunt
hannah
hysterically
hurt
how
i
do
know
pete
told
pete
yes
rosa
had
told
him
we
were
coming
and
he
called
me
up
he
said
maybe
i
could
do
something
so
he
told
yes
yes
but
told
you
what
that
he
was
how
i
could
hear
all
but
i
think
was
an
accident
automobile
and
billy
billy
pete
says
it
his
arm
his
right
arm
and
that
maybe
he
ca
ever
again
billy
fell
back
as
if
the
words
had
been
a
blow
not
that
aunt
hannah
not
that
that
what
pete
said
i
could
get
all
of
it
but
i
got
that
and
billy
he
been
out
of
his
head
though
he
is
now
pete
says
and
and
and
he
been
calling
for
for
a
swift
change
came
to
billy
face
yes
over
and
over
again
he
called
for
you
while
he
was
crazy
you
know
that
why
pete
told
me
he
said
he
did
rightly
understand
what
the
trouble
was
but
he
did
believe
there
was
any
trouble
between
you
two
anyway
that
you
would
think
there
was
if
you
could
hear
him
and
know
how
he
wanted
you
and
why
billy
billy
was
on
her
feet
now
her
fingers
were
on
the
electric
that
would
summon
rosa
her
face
was
illumined
the
next
moment
rosa
appeared
tell
john
to
bring
peggy
to
the
door
at
once
please
directed
her
mistress
billy
gasped
aunt
hannah
again
as
the
maid
disappeared
billy
was
tremblingly
putting
on
the
hat
she
had
but
just
taken
off
billy
what
are
you
going
to
do
billy
turned
in
obvious
surprise
why
i
going
to
bertram
of
to
bertram
but
it
nearly
eight
child
and
it
rains
and
everything
but
bertram

exclaimed
billy
as
if
i
mind
rain
or
time
or
anything
else
but
but
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
groaned
aunt
hannah
beginning
to
wring
her
hands
again
billy
reached
for
her
coat
aunt
hannah
stirred
into
sudden
action
but
billy
if
you
only
wait
till
she
quavered
putting
out
a
feebly
restraining
hand
the
young
voice
rang
with
supreme
scorn
do
you
think
wait
till
after
all
this
i
say
bertram
billy
picked
up
her
gloves
but
you
broke
it
off
dear
you
said
you
did
and
to
go
down
there
like
this
billy
lifted
her
head
her
eyes
shone
her
whole
face
was
a
glory
of
love
and
pride
that
was
before
i
did
know
he
me
aunt
hannah
did
you
hear
he
me
and
now
i
wo
even
hinder
him
if
he
ca
again
billy
voice
broke
the
glory
left
her
face
her
eyes
brimmed
with
tears
but
her
head
was
still
bravely
uplifted
going
to
bertram
blindly
aunt
hannah
got
to
her
feet
still
more
blindly
she
reached
for
her
bonnet
and
cloak
on
the
chair
near
her
oh
will
you
go
too
asked
billy
abstractedly
hurrying
to
the
window
to
look
for
the
motor
car
will
i
go
too
burst
out
aunt
hannah
indignant
voice
do
you
think
i
let
you
go
alone
and
at
this
time
of
night
on
such
a
chase
as
this
i
do
know
i
sure
murmured
billy
still
abstractedly
peering
out
into
the
rain
do
know
indeed
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
groaned
aunt
hannah
setting
her
bonnet
hopelessly
askew
on
top
of
her
agitated
head
but
billy
did
not
even
answer
now
her
face
was
pressed
hard
against
the
chapter
xxxiii
bertram
takes
the
reins
with
stiffly
pompous
dignity
pete
opened
the
door
the
next
moment
he
fell
back
in
amazement
before
the
impetuous
rush
of
a
young
woman
who
demanded
where
is
he
pete
miss
billy
gasped
the
old
man
then
he
saw
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
with
her
bonnet
askew
her
awry
one
hand
bare
and
the
other
half
covered
with
a
glove
wrong
side
out
aunt
hannah
cheeks
too
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
starry
but
with
dismay
and
anger
the
last
because
she
did
not
like
the
way
pete
had
said
miss
billy
name
it
was
one
matter
for
her
to
object
to
this
thing
billy
was
doing
but
quite
another
for
pete
to
do
it
of
course
it
she
retorted
aunt
hannah
testily
as
if
you
yourself
did
bring
her
here
with
your
crazy
messages
at
this
time
of
night
pete
where
is
he
interposed
billy
tell
bertram
i
am
here
or
wait
i
go
right
in
and
surprise
this
time
it
was
aunt
hannah
who
gasped
her
name
pete
had
recovered
himself
by
now
but
he
did
not
even
glance
toward
aunt
hannah
his
face
was
beaming
and
his
old
eyes
were
shining
miss
billy
miss
billy
you
an
angel
straight
from
heaven
you
are
you
are
oh
i
so
glad
you
came
it
be
all
right
now
all
right
he
in
the
den
miss
billy
turned
eagerly
but
before
she
could
take
so
much
as
one
step
toward
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
aunt
hannah
indignant
voice
arrested
her
you
not
an
angel
you
a
young
woman
and
a
crazy
one
at
that
whatever
angels
do
young
women
do
go
unannounced
and
unchaperoned
into
young
men
rooms
pete
go
tell
your
master
that
are
here
and
ask
if
he
will
receive
pete
lips
twitched
the
emphatic
we
and
us
were
not
lost
on
him
but
his
face
was
preternaturally
grave
when
he
spoke
mr
bertram
is
up
and
dressed
he
in
the
den
i
speak
to
pete
once
again
the
punctilious
butler
stalked
to
the
door
of
bertram
den
and
threw
it
wide
open
opposite
the
door
on
a
low
couch
lay
bertram
his
head
bandaged
and
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
his
face
was
turned
toward
the
door
but
his
eyes
were
closed
he
looked
very
white
and
his
features
were
pitifully
drawn
with
suffering
mr
bertram
began
pete
but
he
got
no
further
a
flying
figure
brushed
by
him
and
fell
on
its
knees
by
the
couch
with
a
low
cry
bertram
eyes
flew
open
across
his
face
swept
such
a
radiant
look
of
unearthly
joy
that
pete
sobbed
audibly
and
fled
to
the
kitchen
dong
ling
found
him
there
a
minute
later
polishing
a
silver
teaspoon
with
a
fringed
napkin
that
had
been
spread
over
bertram
tray
in
the
hall
above
aunt
hannah
was
crying
into
william
gray
linen
duster
that
hung
on
the
aunt
hannah
handkerchief
was
on
the
floor
back
at
hillside
in
the
den
neither
billy
nor
bertram
knew
or
cared
what
had
become
of
aunt
hannah
and
pete
there
were
just
two
people
in
their
world
two
people
and
unutterable
incredible
overwhelming
rapture
and
peace
then
very
gradually
it
dawned
over
them
that
there
was
after
all
something
strange
and
unexplained
in
it
all
but
dearest
what
does
it
mean
you
here
like
this
asked
bertram
then
as
if
to
make
sure
that
she
was
here
like
this
he
drew
her
even
closer
bertram
was
so
thankful
that
he
did
have
one
arm
that
was
usable
billy
on
her
knees
by
the
couch
snuggled
into
the
curve
of
the
one
arm
with
a
contented
little
sigh
well
you
see
just
as
soon
as
i
found
out
that
you
wanted
me
i
came
she
said
you
darling
that
was
bertram
stopped
suddenly
a
puzzled
frown
showed
below
the
fantastic
bandage
about
his
head
soon
as
he
quoted
then
scornfully
were
you
ever
by
any
possible
chance
thinking
i
want
you
billy
eyes
widened
a
little
why
bertram
dear
do
you
see
when
you
were
so
troubled
that
the
picture
did
go
well
and
i
found
out
it
was
about
me
you
were
troubled
i
well
bertram
voice
was
a
little
strained
why
of
of
course
stammered
billy
i
could
help
thinking
that
maybe
you
had
found
out
you
want
want
you
groaned
bertram
his
tense
muscles
relaxing
may
i
ask
why
billy
blushed
i
was
quite
sure
why
she
faltered
only
of
course
i
thought
of
of
miss
winthrop
you
know
or
that
maybe
it
was
because
you
care
for
girl
only
to
paint
oh
oh
bertram
pete
told
us
she
broke
off
wildly
beginning
to
sob
pete
told
you
that
i
did
care
for
any
girl
only
to
paint
demanded
bertram
angry
and
mystified
no
no
sobbed
billy
not
that
it
was
all
the
others
that
told
me
that
pete
told
aunt
hannah
about
the
accident
you
know
and
he
said
he
said
oh
bertram
i
say
it
but
that
one
of
the
things
that
made
me
know
i
come
now
you
see
because
i
i
would
hinder
you
nor
slay
your
art
nor
any
other
of
those
dreadful
things
if
if
you
could
ever
again
finished
billy
in
an
uncontrollable
burst
of
grief
there
there
dear
comforted
bertram
patting
the
head
on
his
breast
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
you
talking
about
except
the
last
but
i
know
there
be
anything
that
ought
to
make
you
cry
like
that
as
for
my
not
painting
again
you
understand
pete
dearie
that
was
what
they
were
afraid
of
at
first
that
i
lose
my
arm
but
that
danger
is
all
past
now
loads
better
of
course
i
going
to
paint
again
and
better
than
ever
before
billy
lifted
her
head
a
look
that
was
almost
terror
came
to
her
eyes
she
pulled
herself
half
away
from
bertram
encircling
arm
why
billy
cried
the
man
in
pained
surprise
you
do
mean
to
say
you
i
going
to
paint
again
no
no
oh
no
bertram
never
that
she
faltered
still
regarding
him
with
fearful
eyes
it
only
for
you
know
i
go
back
now
and
not
have
you
after
this
even
if
i
do
hinder
you
and
me
what
are
you
talking
about
billy
billy
drew
a
quivering
sigh
well
to
begin
with
kate
said
good
heavens
is
kate
in
too
bertram
voice
was
savage
now
well
she
wrote
a
i
warrant
she
did
great
scott
billy
do
you
know
kate
by
this
time
i
said
so
too
but
bertram
what
she
wrote
was
true
i
found
it
everywhere
afterwards
in
magazines
and
papers
and
even
in
humph
well
dearie
i
do
know
yet
what
you
found
but
i
do
know
you
would
have
found
it
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
kate
and
i
wish
i
had
her
here
this
minute
billy
giggled
hysterically
i
do
not
here
she
cooed
nestling
comfortably
against
her
lover
arm
but
you
see
dear
she
never
approved
of
the
well
who
doing
the
marrying
she
or
i
that
what
i
said
too
only
in
another
way
sighed
billy
but
she
called
us
flyaway
flutterbudgets
and
she
said
i
ruin
your
career
if
i
did
marry
well
i
can
tell
you
right
now
billy
you
will
ruin
it
if
you
do
declared
bertram
that
what
ailed
me
all
the
time
i
was
painting
that
miserable
portrait
i
was
so
worried
for
fear
i
lose
lose
me
why
bertram
henshaw
what
do
you
mean
a
shamed
red
crept
to
the
man
forehead
well
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
own
up
now
as
any
time
i
was
scared
blue
billy
with
jealousy
of
billy
laughed
gayly
but
she
shifted
her
position
and
did
not
meet
her
lover
eyes
arkwright
nonsense
she
cried
why
he
going
to
marry
alice
greggory
i
know
he
is
i
can
see
it
as
plain
as
day
in
her
letters
he
there
a
and
you
never
did
think
for
a
minute
billy
that
you
cared
for
him
bertram
gaze
searched
billy
face
a
little
fearfully
he
had
not
been
slow
to
mark
that
swift
lowering
of
her
eyelids
but
billy
looked
him
now
straight
in
the
face
it
was
a
level
frank
gaze
of
absolute
truth
never
dear
she
said
firmly
billy
was
so
glad
bertram
had
turned
the
question
on
love
instead
of
arkwright
there
has
never
really
been
any
one
but
thank
god
for
that
breathed
bertram
as
he
drew
the
bright
head
nearer
and
held
it
close
after
a
minute
billy
stirred
and
sighed
happily
are
lovers
the
for
imagining
things
she
murmured
they
certainly
you
see
i
was
in
love
with
i
see
i
and
and
you
did
care
for
for
miss
winthrop
eh
well
no
exploded
bertram
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
billy
put
a
soft
finger
on
his
lips
er
who
live
in
you
know
she
reminded
him
with
roguish
eyes
bertram
kissed
the
finger
and
subsided
humph
he
commented
there
was
a
long
silence
then
a
little
breathlessly
billy
asked
and
you
do
after
all
love
me
just
to
paint
well
what
is
that
is
that
kate
too
demanded
bertram
grimly
billy
laughed
no
oh
she
said
it
all
right
but
you
see
said
that
to
me
bertram
and
that
what
made
me
so
so
worried
sometimes
when
you
talked
about
the
tilt
of
my
chin
and
all
well
by
jove
breathed
bertram
there
was
another
silence
then
suddenly
bertram
stirred
billy
i
going
to
marry
you
he
announced
decisively
billy
lifted
her
head
and
sat
back
in
palpitating
dismay
bertram
what
an
absurd
idea
well
i
am
i
do
as
i
can
trust
you
out
of
my
sight
till
you
read
something
or
hear
something
or
get
a
letter
from
kate
after
breakfast
morning
that
will
set
you
again
and
i
do
want
to
be
saved
that
way
i
going
to
marry
you
i
get
he
stopped
short
with
a
sudden
frown
confound
that
law
i
forgot
great
scott
billy
i
have
to
trust
you
five
days
after
all
there
a
new
law
about
the
license
we
to
wait
five
days
and
maybe
more
counting
in
the
notice
and
billy
laughed
softly
five
days

i
wonder
if
you
think
i
can
get
ready
to
be
married
in
five

you
to
get
ready
retorted
bertram
promptly
i
saw
marie
get
ready
and
i
had
all
i
wanted
of
it
if
you
really
must
have
all
those
miles
of
tablecloths
and
napkins
and
doilies
and
lace
rufflings
we
do
it
afterwards
not
but
besides
i
you
to
take
care
of
me
cut
in
bertram
craftily
bertram
do
you
really
the
tender
glow
on
billy
face
told
its
own
story
and
bertram
eager
eyes
were
not
slow
to
read
it
sweetheart
see
here
dear
he
cried
softly
tightening
his
good
left
arm
and
forthwith
he
began
to
tell
her
how
much
he
did
indeed
need
her
billy
my
dear
it
was
aunt
hannah
plaintive
voice
at
the
doorway
a
little
later
we
must
go
home
and
william
is
here
too
and
wants
to
see
billy
rose
at
once
as
aunt
hannah
entered
the
room
yes

hannah

she
glanced
at
bertram
mischievously
i
shall

the
time

to
prepare
for
my
your
wedding
you
mean

aunt
hannah
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
uncertainly
something
in
their
smiling
faces
sent
a
quick
suspicion
to
her
eyes
yes
nodded
billy
demurely

bertram
airily
we
wanted
it
but
we
had
to
wait
on
account
of
the
new
license
law
otherwise
it
would
have
been
so
long
and
but
aunt
hannah
was
gone
with
a
long
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
she
had
fled
through
the
hall
door
well
it
long
maintained
bertram
with
tender
eyes
as
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
say
