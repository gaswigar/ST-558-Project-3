this
little
book
is
inscribed
with
feelings

thorough
respect
and
esteem
prefatory
note
in
its
earlier
abridged
form
this
address
was
given
as
a
phi
beta
kappa
oration
at
brown
university
and
as
a
lecture
at
new
york
boston
new
haven
ann
arbor
and
elsewhere
in
that
form
substantially
it
was
published
in
the
popular
science
monthly
i
have
now
given
it
careful
revision
correcting
some
errors
and
extending
it
largely
by
presenting
new
facts
and
developing
various
points
of
interest
in
the
general
discussion
among
the
subjects
added
or
rewrought
are
in
astronomy
the
struggle
of
galileo
and
the
retreat
of
the
church
after
its
victory
in
chemistry
and
physics
the
compromise
between
science
and
theology
made
by
thomas
aquinas
and
the
unfortunate
route
taken
by
science
in
consequence
in
anatomy
and
medicine
the
earlier
growth
of
ecclesiastical
distrust
of
these
sciences
in
scientific
education
the
dealings
of
various
european
universities
with
scientific
studies
in
political
and
social
science
a
more
complete
statement
of
the
opposition
of
the
church
on
scriptural
grounds
to
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
and
in
the
conclusion
a
more
careful
summing
up
if
i
have
seemed
to
encumber
the
text
with
notes
it
has
been
in
the
intention
to
leave
no
important
assertion
unsupported
and
in
the
hope
that
others
less
engrossed
with
administrative
care
than
myself
may
find
in
them
indications
for
more
extended
studies
in
various
parts
of
the
struggle
which
i
have
but
sketched
cornell
university
the
warfare
of
science
i
purpose
to
present
an
outline
of
the
great
sacred
struggle
for
the
liberty
of
science
a
struggle
which
has
lasted
for
so
many
centuries
and
which
yet
continues
a
hard
contest
it
has
been
a
war
waged
longer
with
battles
fiercer
with
sieges
more
persistent
with
strategy
more
shrewd
than
in
any
of
the
comparatively
transient
warfare
of
cæsar
or
napoleon
or
moltke
i
shall
ask
you
to
go
with
me
through
some
of
the
most
protracted
sieges
and
over
some
of
the
of
this
war
we
will
look
well
at
the
combatants
we
will
listen
to
the
we
will
note
the
strategy
of
leaders
the
cut
and
thrust
of
champions
the
weight
of
missiles
the
temper
of
weapons
we
will
look
also
at
the
truces
and
treaties
and
note
the
delusive
impotency
of
all
compromises
in
which
the
warriors
for
scientific
truth
have
consented
to
receive
direction
or
bias
from
the
best
of
men
uninspired
by
the
scientific
spirit
or
unfamiliar
with
scientific
methods
my
thesis
which
by
an
historical
study
of
this
warfare
i
expect
to
develop
is
the
following
all
modern
history
interference
with
science
in
the
supposed
interest
of
religion
no
matter
how
conscientious
such
interference
may
have
been
has
resulted
in
the
direst
evils
both
to
religion
and
to
science
and
invariably
and
on
the
other
hand
all
untrammeled
scientific
investigation
no
matter
how
dangerous
to
religion
some
of
its
stages
may
have
seemed
for
the
time
to
be
has
invariably
resulted
in
the
highest
good
of
religion
and
of
i
say
invariably
i
mean
exactly
that
it
is
a
rule
to
which
history
shows
not
one
exception
it
would
seem
logically
that
this
statement
can
not
be
gainsaid
god
truths
must
agree
whether
discovered
by
looking
within
upon
the
soul
or
without
upon
the
world
a
truth
written
upon
the
human
heart
in
its
full
play
of
emotions
or
passions
can
not
be
at
any
real
variance
even
with
a
truth
written
upon
a
fossil
whose
poor
life
ebbed
forth
millions
of
years
ago
this
being
so
it
would
also
seem
a
truth
irrefragable
that
the
search
for
each
of
these
kinds
of
truth
must
be
followed
out
on
its
own
lines
by
its
own
methods
to
its
own
results
without
any
interference
from
investigators
on
other
lines
or
by
other
methods
and
it
would
also
seem
logical
to
work
on
in
absolute
confidence
that
whatever
at
any
moment
may
seem
to
be
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
different
bands
of
workers
they
must
at
last
come
together
for
truth
is
one
but
logic
is
not
history
history
is
full
of
interferences
which
have
cost
the
earth
dear
strangest
of
all
some
of
the
direst
of
them
have
been
made
by
the
best
of
men
actuated
by
the
purest
motives
and
seeking
the
noblest
results
these
interferences
and
the
struggle
against
them
make
up
the
warfare
of
science
one
statement
more
to
clear
the
ground
you
will
not
understand
me
at
all
to
say
that
religion
has
done
nothing
for
science
it
has
done
much
for
it
the
work
of
christianity
has
been
mighty
indeed
through
these
two
thousand
years
despite
the
waste
of
its
energies
on
all
the
things
its
blessed
founder
most
earnestly
condemned
on
fetich
and
subtlety
and
war
and
pomp
it
has
undermined
servitude
mitigated
tyranny
given
hope
to
the
hopeless
comfort
to
the
afflicted
light
to
the
blind
bread
to
the
starving
joy
to
the
dying
and
this
work
continues
and
its
work
for
science
too
has
been
great
it
has
fostered
science
often
nay
it
has
nourished
that
feeling
of
for
human
good
which
has
nerved
some
of
the
bravest
men
for
these
battles
unfortunately
a
devoted
army
of
good
men
started
centuries
ago
with
the
idea
that
independent
scientific
investigation
is
unsafe
that
theology
must
intervene
to
superintend
its
methods
and
the
biblical
record
as
an
historical
compendium
and
scientific
treatise
be
taken
as
a
standard
to
determine
its
results
so
began
this
great
modern
war
geography
the
first
typical
to
which
i
would
refer
is
that
of
geography
the
simplest
elementary
doctrine
of
the
earth
shape
and
surface
among
the
legacies
of
thought
left
by
the
ancient
world
to
the
modern
were
certain
ideas
of
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
these
ideas
were
vague
they
were
mixed
with
absurdities
but
they
were
and
after
the
barbarian
storm
which
ushered
in
the
modern
world
had
begun
to
clear
away
these
germ
ideas
began
to
bud
and
bloom
in
the
minds
of
a
few
thinking
men
and
these
men
hazarded
the
suggestion
that
the
earth
is
round
is
a
globe
the
greatest
and
most
earnest
men
of
the
time
took
fright
at
once
to
them
the
idea
of
the
earth
rotundity
seemed
fraught
with
dangers
to
scripture
by
which
of
course
they
meant
of
scripture
among
the
first
who
took
up
arms
against
the
new
thinkers
was
eusebius
he
endeavored
to
turn
off
these
ideas
by
bringing
science
into
contempt
and
by
making
the
innovators
understand
that
he
and
the
fathers
of
the
church
despised
all
such
inquiries
speaking
of
the
innovations
in
physical
science
he
said
it
is
not
through
ignorance
of
the
things
admired
by
them
but
through
contempt
of
their
useless
labor
that
we
think
little
of
these
matters
turning
our
souls
to
better
things
lactantius
asserted
the
ideas
of
those
studying
astronomy
to
be
mad
and
senseless
but
the
attempt
to
flank
the
little
phalanx
of
thinkers
did
not
succeed
of
course
even
such
men
as
lactantius
and
eusebius
can
not
down
a
new
scientific
idea
the
little
band
of
thinkers
went
on
and
the
doctrine
of
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
naturally
led
to
the
consideration
of
the
tenants
of
the
earth
surface
and
another
germ
idea
was
warmed
into
life
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
the
idea
of
the
existence
of
countries
and
men
on
the
hemisphere
opposite
to
ours
at
this
the
waxed
hot
those
great
and
good
men
determined
to
fight
to
all
of
them
such
doctrines
seemed
dangerous
to
most
of
them
they
seemed
damnable
st
basil
and
ambrose
were
tolerant
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
might
be
saved
who
believed
the
earth
to
be
round
and
inhabited
on
its
opposite
sides
but
the
great
majority
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
utterly
denied
the
possibility
of
salvation
to
such
misbelievers
lactantius
asks
is
there
any
one
so
senseless
as
to
believe
that
there
are
men
whose
footsteps
are
higher
than
their
heads
that
the
crops
and
trees
grow
downward
that
the
rains
and
snow
and
hail
fall
upward
toward
the
earth
but
if
you
inquire
from
those
who
defend
these
marvelous
fictions
why
all
things
do
not
fall
into
that
lower
part
of
the
heaven
they
reply
that
such
is
the
nature
of
things
that
heavy
bodies
are
borne
toward
the
middle
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
while
light
bodies
such
as
clouds
smoke
and
fire
tend
from
the
centre
toward
the
heavens
on
all
sides
now
i
am
at
loss
what
to
say
of
those
who
when
they
have
once
erred
steadily
persevere
in
their
folly
and
defend
one
vain
thing
by
another
augustine
seems
inclined
to
yield
a
little
in
regard
to
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
but
he
fights
the
idea
that
men
exist
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
saying
that
scripture
speaks
of
no
such
descendants
of
adam
but
this
did
not
avail
to
check
the
idea
what
may
be
called
the
flank
movement
as
represented
by
eusebius
had
failed
the
direct
battle
given
by
lactantius
augustine
and
others
had
failed
in
the
sixth
century
therefore
the
opponents
of
the
new
ideas
built
a
great
fortress
and
retired
into
that
it
was
well
built
and
well
braced
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
complete
theory
of
the
world
based
upon
the
literal
interpretation
of
texts
of
scripture
and
its
author
was
cosmas
indicopleustes
according
to
cosmas
the
earth
is
a
parallelogram
flat
and
surrounded
by
four
great
seas
at
the
outer
edges
of
these
seas
rise
immense
walls
closing
in
the
whole
structure
these
walls
support
the
vault
of
the
heavens
whose
edges
are
cemented
to
the
walls
walls
and
vault
shut
in
the
earth
and
all
the
heavenly
bodies
the
whole
of
this
theologic
scientific
fortress
was
built
most
carefully
and
as
was
then
thought
most
scripturally
starting
with
the
expression
ἁγιον
applied
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
hebrews
to
the
tabernacle
in
the
desert
he
insists
with
other
interpreters
of
his
time
that
it
gives
a
key
to
the
whole
construction
of
the
world
the
universe
is
therefore
made
on
the
plan
of
the
jewish
tabernacle
and
oblong
coming
to
details
he
quotes
those
grand
words
of
isaiah
it
is
he
that
sitteth
upon
the
circle
of
the
earth
that
stretcheth
out
the
heavens
like
a
curtain
and
spreadeth
them
out
like
a
tent
to
dwell
in
and
the
passage
in
job
which
speaks
of
the
pillars
of
heaven
he
turns
all
that
splendid
and
precious
poetry
into
a
prosaic
statement
and
gathers
therefrom
as
he
thinks
treasures
for
science
this
vast
box
is
then
divided
into
two
compartments
one
above
the
other
in
the
first
of
these
men
live
and
stars
move
and
it
extends
up
to
the
first
solid
vault
or
firmament
where
live
the
angels
a
main
part
of
whose
business
it
is
to
push
and
pull
the
sun
and
planets
to
and
fro
next
he
takes
the
text
let
there
be
a
firmament
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
and
let
it
divide
the
waters
from
the
waters
and
other
texts
from
genesis
to
these
he
adds
the
text
from
the
psalms
praise
him
ye
heaven
of
heavens
and
ye
waters
that
be
above
the
heavens
casts
that
outburst
of
poetry
into
his
crucible
with
the
other
texts
and
after
subjecting
them
to
sundry
peculiar
processes
brings
out
the
theory
that
over
this
first
vault
is
a
vast
cistern
containing
the
waters
he
then
takes
the
expression
in
genesis
regarding
the
windows
of
heaven
and
establishes
a
doctrine
regarding
the
regulation
of
the
rain
which
is
afterward
supplemented
by
the
doctrine
that
the
angels
not
only
push
and
pull
the
heavenly
bodies
to
light
the
earth
but
also
open
and
close
the
windows
of
heaven
to
water
it
to
find
the
character
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
cosmas
studies
the
table
of
in
the
tabernacle
the
dimensions
of
that
table
prove
to
him
that
the
earth
is
flat
and
twice
as
long
as
broad
the
four
corners
of
the
table
symbolize
the
four
seasons
to
account
for
the
movement
of
the
sun
cosmas
suggests
that
at
the
north
of
the
earth
is
a
great
mountain
and
that
at
night
the
sun
is
carried
behind
this
but
some
of
the
commentators
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
here
they
thought
that
the
sun
was
pushed
into
a
great
pit
at
night
and
was
pulled
out
in
the
morning
nothing
can
be
more
touching
in
its
simplicity
than
cosmas
closing
of
his
great
argument
he
bursts
forth
in
raptures
declaring
that
moses
the
prophets
evangelists
and
apostles
agree
to
the
truth
of
his
doctrine
such
was
the
fortress
built
against
human
science
in
the
sixth
century
by
cosmas
and
it
stood
the
innovators
attacked
it
in
vain
the
greatest
minds
in
the
church
devoted
themselves
to
buttressing
it
with
new
texts
and
throwing
out
new
outworks
of
theologic
reasoning
it
stood
firm
for
two
hundred
years
when
a
bishop
virgilius
of
salzburg
asserts
his
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
it
happened
that
there
then
stood
in
germany
in
the
first
years
of
the
eighth
century
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
of
men
boniface
his
learning
was
of
the
best
then
known
in
labors
he
was
a
worthy
successor
to
the
apostles
his
genius
for
christian
work
made
him
unwillingly
primate
of
germany
his
devotion
afterward
led
him
willingly
to
martyrdom
there
sat
too
at
that
time
on
the
papal
throne
a
great
christian
statesman
pope
zachary
boniface
immediately
declares
against
the
revival
of
such
a
terrible
heresy
as
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
he
declares
that
it
amounts
to
the
declaration
that
there
are
men
on
the
earth
beyond
the
reach
of
the
means
of
salvation
he
attacks
virgilius
he
calls
on
zachary
for
aid
effective
measures
are
taken
and
we
hear
no
more
of
virgilius
or
his
doctrine
six
hundred
years
pass
away
and
in
the
fourteenth
century
two
men
publicly
assert
the
doctrine
the
first
of
these
peter
of
abano
escapes
punishment
by
natural
death
the
second
known
as
cecco
a
man
of
seventy
years
is
burned
alive
nor
was
that
all
the
punishment
that
great
painter
orcagna
whose
terrible
works
you
may
see
on
the
walls
of
the
campo
santa
at
pisa
immortalized
cecco
by
representing
him
in
the
flames
of
hell
still
the
idea
lived
and
moved
and
a
hundred
years
later
we
find
the
theologian
tostatus
protesting
against
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
as
unsafe
he
has
invented
a
new
missile
the
following
syllogism
the
apostles
were
commanded
to
go
into
all
the
world
and
to
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
they
did
not
go
to
any
such
part
of
the
world
as
the
antipodes
they
did
not
preach
to
any
creatures
there
no
antipodes
exist
this
is
just
before
the
time
of
columbus
columbus
is
the
next
warrior
the
world
has
heard
of
his
battles
how
the
bishop
of
ceuta
worsted
him
in
portugal
how
at
the
junta
of
salamanca
the
theologians
overwhelmed
him
with
quotations
from
the
psalms
from
paul
and
from
st
augustine
and
even
after
columbus
was
triumphant
and
after
his
voyage
had
greatly
strengthened
the
theory
of
the
earth
sphericity
the
church
by
its
highest
authority
was
again
solemnly
committed
to
the
theory
of
the
flatness
in
pope
alexander
vi
issues
a
bull
laying
down
a
line
of
demarkation
upon
the
earth
as
a
flat
disk
this
line
was
drawn
from
north
to
south
west
of
the
azores
and
canary
islands
and
the
pope
in
the
plenitude
of
his
knowledge
and
powers
declared
that
all
lands
discovered
east
of
this
line
should
belong
to
the
portuguese
and
all
discovered
west
of
it
should
belong
to
the
spaniards
this
was
hailed
as
an
exercise
of
divinely
illuminated
power
in
the
church
but
in
a
few
years
difficulties
arose
the
portuguese
claimed
brazil
and
of
course
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
it
could
be
reached
by
sailing
to
the
east
of
the
line
provided
the
sailing
were
sufficiently
the
bull
of
pope
alexander
quietly
passed
into
the
catalogue
of
ludicrous
errors
but
in
science
gains
a
crushing
victory
magalhaens
makes
his
famous
voyages
he
proves
the
earth
to
be
round
for
his
great
expedition
circumnavigates
it
he
proves
the
doctrine
of
the
antipodes
for
he
sees
the
men
of
the
antipodes
but
even
this
does
not
end
the
war
many
earnest
and
good
men
oppose
the
doctrine
for
two
hundred
years
longer
then
the
french
astronomers
make
their
measurements
of
degrees
in
equatorial
and
polar
regions
and
add
to
other
proofs
that
of
the
lengthened
pendulum
when
this
was
done
when
the
deductions
of
science
were
seen
to
be
established
by
the
simple
test
of
measurement
beautifully
perfectly
then
and
then
only
this
war
of
twelve
centuries
ended
and
now
what
was
the
result
of
this
war
the
efforts
of
eusebius
and
lactantius
to
deaden
scientific
thought
the
efforts
of
augustine
to
combat
it
the
efforts
of
cosmas
to
stop
it
by
dogmatism
the
efforts
of
boniface
and
zachary
and
others
to
stop
it
by
force
conscientious
as
they
all
were
had
resulted
in
what
simply
in
forcing
into
many
noble
minds
this
most
unfortunate
conviction
that
science
and
religion
are
enemies
simply
in
driving
away
from
religion
hosts
of
the
best
men
in
all
those
centuries
the
result
was
wholly
bad
no
optimism
can
change
that
verdict
on
the
other
hand
what
was
gained
by
the
warriors
of
science
for
religion
simply
a
far
more
ennobling
conception
of
the
world
and
a
far
truer
conception
of
him
who
made
and
who
sustains
it
which
is
the
more
consistent
with
a
great
true
religion
the
cosmography
of
cosmas
or
that
of
isaac
newton
which
presents
the
nobler
food
for
religious
thought
the
diatribes
of
lactantius
or
the
astronomical
discourses
of
thomas
chalmers
astronomy
the
next
great
battle
was
fought
on
a
question
relating
to
the
of
the
earth
among
the
heavenly
on
one
side
the
great
body
of
conscientious
religious
men
planted
themselves
firmly
on
the
geocentric
doctrine
the
doctrine
that
the
earth
is
the
centre
and
that
the
sun
and
planets
revolve
about
it
the
doctrine
was
old
and
of
the
highest
respectability
the
very
name
ptolemaic
theory
carried
weight
it
had
been
elaborated
until
it
accounted
well
for
the
phenomena
exact
textual
interpreters
of
scripture
cherished
it
for
it
agreed
with
the
letter
of
the
sacred
text
but
most
important
of
all
it
was
stamped
with
the
seal
of
thomas
aquinas
the
sainted
theologian
the
glory
of
the
mediæval
church
the
angelic
doctor
he
to
whom
it
was
believed
an
image
of
the
crucified
had
spoken
words
praising
his
writings
had
shown
in
his
treatise
on
the
heaven
and
earth
by
philosophy
theology
and
revelation
that
the
position
of
the
earth
must
be
in
the
centre
still
the
germs
of
the
heliocentric
theory
had
been
planted
long
before
and
well
planted
it
had
seemed
ready
even
to
bloom
forth
in
the
fifth
century
from
the
mind
of
martianus
capella
and
in
the
fifteenth
from
the
mind
of
cardinal
de
cusa
but
it
could
not
be
forgotten
that
thomas
had
elaborated
the
opposite
view
the
chill
of
dogmatism
was
still
over
the
earth
and
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
there
had
come
to
this
great
truth
neither
bloom
nor
fruitage
quietly
however
the
soil
was
receiving
enrichment
and
the
air
warmth
the
processes
of
mathematics
were
constantly
improved
the
heavenly
bodies
were
steadily
though
silently
observed
and
at
length
appeared
afar
off
from
the
centres
of
thought
on
the
borders
of
poland
a
plain
scholar
who
first
fairly
uttered
to
the
world
the
truth
now
so
commonplace
then
so
astounding
that
the
sun
and
planets
do
not
revolve
about
the
earth
but
that
the
earth
and
planets
revolve
about
the
sun
and
that
man
was
nicholas
kopernik
kopernik
had
been
a
professor
at
rome
but
as
this
truth
grew
within
him
he
seemed
to
feel
that
at
rome
he
was
no
longer
safe
to
publish
this
thought
was
dangerous
indeed
and
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
lay
slumbering
in
the
minds
of
kopernik
and
the
friends
to
whom
he
had
privately
intrusted
it
at
last
he
prepares
his
great
work
on
the
of
the
heavenly
and
dedicates
it
to
the
pope
himself
he
next
seeks
a
place
of
publication
he
dares
not
send
it
to
rome
for
there
are
the
rulers
of
the
older
church
ready
to
seize
it
he
dares
not
send
it
to
wittenberg
for
there
are
the
leaders
of
protestantism
no
less
hostile
it
is
therefore
intrusted
to
osiander
of
nuremberg
but
at
the
last
moment
osiander
courage
fails
him
he
dares
not
launch
the
new
thought
boldly
he
writes
a
groveling
preface
endeavors
to
excuse
kopernik
for
his
novel
idea
he
inserts
the
apologetic
lie
that
kopernik
propounds
the
doctrine
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
not
as
a
but
as
an
he
declares
that
it
is
lawful
for
an
astronomer
to
indulge
his
and
that
this
is
what
kopernik
has
done
thus
was
the
greatest
and
most
ennobling
perhaps
of
scientific
truths
a
truth
not
less
ennobling
to
religion
than
to
science
forced
in
coming
into
the
world
to
sneak
and
crawl
on
the
of
may
the
book
first
arrived
at
the
house
of
kopernik
it
was
put
into
his
hands
but
he
was
on
his
a
few
hours
later
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
those
mistaken
conscientious
men
whose
consciences
would
have
blotted
his
reputation
and
perhaps
have
destroyed
his
life
yet
not
wholly
beyond
their
reach
even
death
could
not
be
trusted
to
shield
him
there
seems
to
have
been
fear
of
vengeance
upon
his
corpse
for
on
his
tombstone
was
placed
no
record
of
his
labors
no
mention
of
his
great
discovery
there
were
graven
upon
it
affecting
words
which
may
be
thus
simply
translated
i
ask
not
the
grace
accorded
to
paul
not
that
given
to
peter
give
me
only
the
favor
which
thou
didst
show
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
not
till
thirty
years
after
did
a
friend
dare
write
on
his
tombstone
a
memorial
of
his
discovery
the
book
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
proper
authorities
in
due
time
it
was
solemnly
condemned
to
read
it
was
to
risk
damnation
and
the
world
accepted
the
decree
the
earnest
theologians
of
the
period
immediately
wheeled
their
batteries
of
sacred
learning
to
support
the
church
in
its
effort
to
beat
back
the
terrible
doctrine
that
the
earth
revolves
about
the
sun
among
the
most
vigorous
of
them
in
northern
europe
was
fromundus
from
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
of
antwerp
he
sent
forth
his
famous
treatise
the
full
of
the
strongest
arguments
against
the
new
theory
his
very
was
a
contemptuous
insult
to
the
memory
of
kopernik
since
it
paraded
the
assumption
that
the
new
truth
was
only
an
old
and
exploded
theory
of
aristarchus
he
declares
that
sacred
scripture
fights
against
the
copernicans
to
prove
that
the
sun
revolves
about
the
earth
he
cites
the
passage
in
the
psalms
which
speaks
of
the
sun
which
cometh
forth
as
a
bridegroom
out
of
his
chamber
to
prove
that
the
earth
stands
still
he
quotes
the
passage
from
ecclesiastes
the
earth
standeth
fast
forever
to
show
the
utter
futility
of
the
copernican
ideas
he
indulges
in
scientific
reasoning
as
he
understands
it
declaring
that
if
the
hated
theory
were
true
the
wind
would
constantly
blow
from
the
east
we
should
with
great
difficulty
hear
sounds
against
such
a
wind
that
buildings
and
the
earth
itself
would
fly
off
with
such
a
rapid
motion
and
greatest
weapon
of
all
he
works
up
by
the
use
of
aristotle
and
thomas
aquinas
a
demonstration
from
theology
and
science
combined
that
the
earth
must
stand
in
the
centre
and
that
the
sun
must
revolve
about
it
doubtless
many
will
at
once
exclaim
against
the
roman
catholic
church
for
this
justice
compels
me
to
say
that
the
founders
of
protestantism
were
no
less
zealous
against
the
new
scientific
doctrine
said
martin
luther
people
gave
ear
to
an
upstart
astrologer
who
strove
to
show
that
the
earth
revolves
not
the
heavens
or
the
firmament
the
sun
and
the
moon
whoever
wishes
to
appear
clever
must
devise
some
new
system
which
of
all
systems
is
of
course
the
very
best
this
fool
wishes
to
reverse
the
entire
science
of
astronomy
but
sacred
scripture
tells
us
that
joshua
commanded
the
sun
to
stand
still
and
not
the
earth
melanchthon
mild
as
he
was
was
not
behind
luther
in
condemning
kopernik
in
his
treatise
doctrinæ
he
says
the
eyes
are
witnesses
that
the
heavens
revolve
in
the
space
of
hours
but
certain
men
either
from
the
love
of
novelty
or
to
make
a
display
of
ingenuity
have
concluded
that
the
earth
moves
and
they
maintain
that
neither
the
eighth
sphere
nor
the
sun
revolves
now
it
is
a
want
of
honesty
and
decency
to
assert
such
notions
publicly
and
the
example
is
pernicious
it
is
the
part
of
a
good
mind
to
accept
the
truth
as
revealed
by
god
and
to
acquiesce
in
it
melanchthon
then
cites
passages
from
the
psalms
and
from
ecclesiastes
which
he
declares
assert
positively
and
clearly
that
the
earth
stands
fast
and
that
the
sun
moves
around
it
and
adds
eight
other
proofs
of
his
proposition
that
the
earth
can
be
nowhere
if
not
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
protestant
people
were
not
a
whit
behind
catholic
in
following
out
these
teachings
the
people
of
elbing
made
themselves
merry
over
a
farce
in
which
kopernik
was
the
main
object
of
ridicule
the
people
of
nuremberg
a
great
protestant
centre
caused
a
medal
to
be
struck
with
inscriptions
ridiculing
the
philosopher
and
his
theory
then
was
tried
also
one
piece
of
strategy
very
common
formerly
in
battles
between
theologians
themselves
it
consists
in
loud
shoutings
that
the
doctrine
attacked
is
outworn
and
already
refuted
that
various
distinguished
gentlemen
have
proved
it
false
that
it
is
not
a
living
truth
but
a
detected
lie
that
if
the
world
listens
to
it
that
is
simply
because
the
world
is
ignorant
this
strategy
was
brought
to
bear
on
kopernik
it
was
shown
that
his
doctrine
was
simply
a
revival
of
the
pythagorean
notion
which
had
been
thoroughly
exploded
fromundus
as
we
have
seen
in
his
and
throughout
his
book
delights
in
referring
to
the
doctrine
of
the
revolution
of
the
planets
around
the
sun
as
that
pythagorean
notion
this
mode
of
warfare
was
imitated
by
the
lesser
opponents
and
produced
for
some
time
considerable
effect
but
the
new
truth
could
neither
be
laughed
down
nor
forced
down
many
minds
had
received
it
only
one
tongue
dared
utter
it
this
new
warrior
was
that
strange
mortal
giordano
bruno
he
was
hunted
from
land
to
land
until
at
last
he
turns
on
his
pursuers
with
fearful
invectives
for
this
he
is
imprisoned
six
years
then
burned
alive
and
his
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds
still
the
new
truth
lived
on
it
could
not
be
killed
within
ten
years
after
the
martyrdom
of
bruno
after
a
world
of
troubles
and
persecutions
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
of
kopernik
was
established
by
the
telescope
of
galileo
herein
was
fulfilled
one
of
the
most
touching
of
prophecies
years
before
the
enemies
of
kopernik
had
said
to
him
if
your
doctrines
were
true
venus
would
show
phases
like
the
moon
kopernik
answered
you
are
right
i
know
not
what
to
say
but
god
is
good
and
will
in
time
find
an
answer
to
this
objection
the
answer
came
when
the
rude
telescope
of
galileo
showed
the
phases
of
venus
on
this
new
champion
galileo
the
war
was
long
and
bitter
the
supporters
of
what
was
called
sound
learning
declared
his
discoveries
deceptions
and
his
announcements
blasphemy
professors
endeavoring
to
curry
favor
with
the
church
attacked
him
with
sham
science
earnest
preachers
attacked
him
with
perverted
scripture
i
shall
present
this
warfare
at
some
length
because
so
far
as
i
can
find
no
careful
outline
of
it
has
been
given
in
our
language
since
the
whole
history
was
placed
in
a
new
light
by
the
revelation
of
the
trial
documents
in
the
vatican
library
published
for
the
first
time
by
de
in
the
first
important
attack
on
galileo
began
when
he
announced
that
his
telescope
had
revealed
the
moons
of
the
planet
jupiter
the
enemy
saw
that
this
strengthened
the
copernican
theory
and
gave
battle
immediately
the
whole
theory
was
denounced
as
impossible
and
impious
professors
bred
in
the
mixed
science
favored
by
the
church
argued
that
the
bible
clearly
showed
by
all
applicable
types
that
there
could
be
only
seven
planets
that
this
was
proved
by
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
of
the
apocalypse
by
the
candlestick
of
the
tabernacle
and
by
the
seven
churches
of
asia
theologians
showed
the
destructive
consequences
which
must
logically
result
to
fundamental
christian
truths
bishops
and
priests
uttered
impressive
warnings
to
their
flocks
and
multitudes
of
the
faithful
besought
the
inquisition
to
protect
the
fold
by
dealing
speedily
and
sharply
with
the
heretic
in
vain
did
galileo
try
to
save
the
great
truths
he
had
discovered
by
his
letters
to
the
benedictine
castelli
and
the
christine
in
which
he
argued
that
literal
biblical
interpretation
should
not
be
applied
to
science
it
was
declared
that
by
making
such
an
argument
his
heresy
was
only
rendered
more
detestable
that
he
was
worse
than
luther
or
calvin
in
vain
did
he
try
to
prove
the
existence
of
satellites
by
showing
them
to
the
doubters
through
his
telescope
they
either
declared
it
impious
to
look
or
if
they
did
see
them
denounced
them
as
illusions
from
the
devil
good
father
clavius
declared
that
to
see
satellites
of
jupiter
men
had
to
make
an
instrument
which
would
create
them
the
war
on
the
copernican
theory
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
carried
on
quietly
now
flamed
forth
it
was
declared
that
the
doctrine
was
proved
false
by
the
standing
still
of
the
sun
for
joshua
by
the
declarations
that
the
foundations
of
the
earth
are
fixed
so
firm
that
they
can
not
be
moved
and
that
the
sun
runneth
about
from
one
end
of
heaven
to
the
other
the
dominican
father
caccini
preached
a
sermon
from
the
text
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven
and
this
wretched
pun
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
sharper
weapons
for
before
caccini
finishes
he
insists
that
geometry
is
of
the
devil
and
that
mathematicians
should
be
banished
as
the
authors
of
all
heresies
and
for
this
the
church
authorities
gave
caccini
promotion
father
lorini
proved
that
the
doctrine
was
not
only
heretical
but
atheistic
and
besought
the
inquisition
to
intervene
the
bishop
of
fiesole
screamed
in
rage
against
the
copernican
system
and
proposed
to
denounce
galileo
to
the
the
archbishop
of
pisa
secretly
sought
to
entrap
galileo
and
deliver
him
to
the
inquisition
at
rome
the
archbishop
of
florence
solemnly
condemned
the
doctrines
of
kopernik
and
galileo
as
unscriptural
but
by
far
the
most
terrible
champion
who
appeared
against
him
was
bellarmin
one
of
the
greatest
of
theologians
and
one
of
the
poorest
of
scientists
he
was
earnest
sincere
learned
but
made
the
fearful
mistake
for
the
world
of
applying
to
science
direct
literal
interpretation
of
scripture
the
weapons
which
men
of
bellarmin
stamp
used
were
theological
they
held
up
before
the
world
the
dreadful
consequences
which
must
result
to
christian
theology
were
the
doctrine
to
prevail
that
the
heavenly
bodies
revolve
about
the
sun
and
not
about
the
earth
their
most
tremendous
theologic
engine
against
galileo
was
the
idea
that
his
pretended
discovery
vitiated
the
whole
christian
plan
of
salvation
father
lecazre
declared
that
it
cast
suspicion
on
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
others
declared
that
it
upset
the
whole
basis
of
theology
that
if
the
earth
is
a
planet
and
one
among
several
planets
it
can
not
be
that
any
such
great
things
have
been
done
especially
for
it
as
the
christian
doctrine
teaches
if
there
are
other
planets
since
god
makes
nothing
in
vain
they
must
be
inhabited
but
how
can
these
inhabitants
be
descended
from
adam
how
can
they
trace
back
their
origin
to
noah
ark
how
can
they
have
been
redeemed
by
the
saviour
nor
was
this
argument
confined
to
the
theologians
of
the
roman
church
melanchthon
protestant
as
he
was
had
already
used
it
in
his
attacks
upon
the
ideas
of
kopernik
and
his
school
in
addition
to
this
prodigious
engine
of
war
there
was
kept
up
a
terrific
fire
of
smaller
artillery
in
the
shape
of
texts
and
scriptural
extracts
but
the
little
telescope
of
galileo
still
swept
the
heavens
and
the
next
revelation
announced
was
the
system
of
mountains
and
valleys
in
the
moon
this
was
a
signal
for
another
attack
it
was
declared
that
this
coupled
with
the
statement
that
the
moon
shines
by
light
reflected
from
the
sun
was
a
contradiction
of
the
statement
in
genesis
that
the
moon
is
a
great
light
like
the
sun
to
make
the
matter
worse
a
painter
placing
the
moon
in
a
religious
picture
in
its
usual
position
beneath
the
feet
of
the
blessed
virgin
outlined
on
its
surface
mountains
and
valleys
this
was
denounced
as
a
sacrilege
logically
resulting
from
the
astronomer
heresy
the
next
struggle
was
aroused
when
the
hated
telescope
revealed
spots
upon
the
sun
and
their
motion
which
indicated
the
sun
rotation
monsignor
elci
head
of
the
university
of
pisa
forbade
the
professor
of
astronomy
castelli
to
mention
these
spots
father
busaeus
at
the
university
of
innspruck
forbade
the
astronomer
scheiner
to
allow
the
new
discovery
to
be
known
there
at
the
college
of
douay
and
the
university
of
louvain
it
was
expressly
placed
under
the
ban
and
this
became
the
general
rule
among
the
catholic
universities
and
colleges
of
europe
the
spanish
universities
were
specially
intolerant
of
this
and
similar
ideas
and
up
to
a
recent
period
they
were
strictly
forbidden
in
the
most
important
university
of
all
that
of
salamanca
in
the
abbé
settele
professor
at
the
college
of
rome
having
announced
a
work
on
optics
and
astronomy
the
master
of
the
sacred
palace
under
the
authority
of
the
old
decrees
against
the
teachings
of
kopernik
and
galileo
forbade
the
publication
and
it
was
not
until
that
pope
pius
vii
sanctioned
a
decision
of
the
inquisition
permitting
such
teachings
such
are
the
consequences
of
placing
the
instruction
of
men
minds
in
the
hands
of
those
mainly
absorbed
in
the
work
of
saving
souls
nothing
could
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
idea
recently
put
forth
by
the
bishop
of
montpellier
that
the
church
is
alone
fully
empowered
to
promulgate
scientific
truth
or
direct
university
instruction
but
science
gained
the
victory
here
also
news
came
of
observations
of
the
solar
spots
not
only
from
galileo
in
italy
but
from
fabricius
in
holland
father
scheiner
then
endeavors
to
make
the
usual
treaty
he
promulgates
a
theory
a
statement
based
on
a
religious
science
which
only
provokes
derision
but
the
war
grew
more
and
more
bitter
and
the
principal
weapons
in
it
are
worth
examining
they
are
very
easily
examined
you
may
pick
them
up
on
any
of
the
of
science
but
on
that
field
they
were
used
with
more
effect
than
on
almost
any
other
these
weapons
are
two
epithets
infidel
and
atheist
the
of
science
are
thickly
strewn
with
these
they
have
been
used
against
almost
every
man
who
has
ever
done
anything
new
for
his
the
list
of
those
who
have
been
denounced
as
infidel
and
atheist
includes
almost
all
great
men
of
science
general
scholars
inventors
philanthropists
the
deepest
christian
life
the
most
noble
christian
character
have
not
availed
to
shield
combatants
christians
like
isaac
newton
and
pascal
and
john
locke
and
john
milton
and
even
howard
and
fénelon
have
had
these
weapons
hurled
against
them
of
all
proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
god
those
of
descartes
have
been
wrought
most
thoroughly
into
the
minds
of
modern
men
and
yet
the
protestant
theologians
of
holland
sought
to
bring
him
to
torture
and
to
death
by
the
charge
of
atheism
and
the
roman
catholic
theologians
of
france
prevented
the
rendering
of
any
due
honors
to
him
at
his
burial
these
epithets
can
hardly
be
classed
with
civilized
weapons
they
are
burning
arrows
they
set
fire
to
great
masses
of
popular
prejudices
smoke
rises
to
obscure
the
real
questions
fire
bursts
forth
at
times
to
destroy
the
attacked
party
they
are
poisoned
they
go
to
the
hearts
of
loving
women
they
alienate
dear
children
they
injure
the
man
after
life
is
ended
for
they
leave
poisoned
wounds
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
loved
him
best
fears
for
his
eternal
happiness
dread
of
the
divine
displeasure
of
course
in
these
days
these
weapons
though
often
effective
in
disturbing
good
men
and
in
scaring
good
women
are
somewhat
blunted
indeed
they
not
unfrequently
injure
assailants
more
than
assailed
so
it
was
not
in
the
days
of
galileo
they
were
then
in
all
their
sharpness
and
venom
yet
far
more
vile
than
the
use
even
of
these
weapons
vile
indeed
beyond
belief
was
the
attack
by
the
archbishop
of
pisa
it
is
a
remark
made
by
one
of
the
most
moderate
and
judicially
fair
of
modern
philosophic
historians
that
of
all
organizations
this
world
has
known
the
roman
church
has
caused
most
undeserved
woe
and
shed
most
innocent
blood
but
in
the
whole
terrible
succession
of
torquemadas
and
arbues
and
granvilles
the
vilest
enemy
of
the
human
race
is
probably
this
same
archbishop
of
pisa
this
man
whose
cathedral
is
more
truly
consecrated
by
the
remembrance
of
galileo
observation
of
the
lamp
swinging
before
its
altar
than
by
all
the
church
services
of
a
thousand
years
began
a
siege
against
the
great
philosopher
galileo
after
his
discoveries
had
been
denounced
as
contrary
to
scripture
had
been
induced
to
write
to
the
duchess
christine
and
to
his
friend
castelli
two
letters
to
show
that
his
discoveries
might
be
reconciled
to
scripture
the
archbishop
saw
his
opportunity
he
determined
to
get
hold
of
these
letters
and
exhibit
them
as
proofs
that
galileo
had
uttered
heretical
views
of
theology
and
the
scriptures
and
thus
to
bring
the
astronomer
hopelessly
into
the
clutch
of
the
inquisition
the
archbishop
begs
castelli
therefore
to
let
him
see
the
original
letter
in
the
handwriting
of
galileo
castelli
declines
the
archbishop
then
while
as
is
now
revealed
writing
constantly
and
bitterly
to
the
inquisitors
against
galileo
professes
to
castelli
the
greatest
admiration
of
galileo
genius
and
a
sincere
desire
to
know
more
of
his
discoveries
castelli
is
seduced
by
this
but
galileo
sturdily
forbids
sending
the
letter
and
the
archbishop
is
obliged
to
resort
to
open
attack
the
whole
struggle
to
crush
galileo
and
to
save
him
would
be
amusing
were
it
not
so
fraught
with
evil
there
were
intrigues
and
plots
and
lying
and
spying
and
in
the
thickest
of
this
seething
squabbling
screaming
mass
priests
bishops
archbishops
cardinals
and
even
the
future
pope
urban
viii
himself
it
is
most
suggestive
to
see
in
this
crisis
of
the
church
on
the
eve
of
the
greatest
errors
in
church
policy
the
world
has
known
in
all
the
efforts
and
deliberations
of
these
consecrated
leaders
of
the
church
at
the
tomb
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
no
more
sign
of
the
guidance
or
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
than
in
a
caucus
of
new
york
politicians
but
the
opposing
powers
were
too
strong
in
galileo
is
summoned
by
the
inquisition
to
rome
and
the
mine
which
had
been
so
long
preparing
was
sprung
pope
paul
and
the
cardinal
inquisitors
order
eleven
theologians
of
the
inquisition
to
examine
these
two
propositions
which
had
been
extracted
from
galileo
letters
on
the
solar
spots
that
the
sun
does
not
move
about
the
earth
that
the
earth
does
move
about
the
sun
the
eleven
theologians
solemnly
considered
these
points
and
in
about
a
month
rendered
a
solemn
decision
that
the
first
proposition
the
sun
is
the
centre
and
does
not
revolve
about
the
earth
is
foolish
absurd
false
in
theology
and
heretical
because
expressly
contrary
to
holy
scripture
and
that
the
second
proposition
that
the
earth
is
not
the
centre
but
revolves
about
the
sun
is
absurd
false
in
philosophy
and
from
a
theological
point
of
view
at
least
opposed
to
the
true
the
pope
himself
paul
now
intervenes
he
orders
that
galileo
be
brought
before
the
inquisition
then
the
great
man
of
science
in
that
age
is
brought
face
to
face
with
the
greatest
theologian
galileo
is
confronted
by
cardinal
bellarmin
bellarmin
shows
galileo
the
error
of
his
opinion
and
orders
him
to
renounce
it
de
lauda
fortified
by
a
letter
from
the
pope
ordering
the
astronomer
to
be
placed
in
the
dungeon
of
the
inquisition
should
he
refuse
to
yield
commands
him
to
entirely
the
opinion
that
the
sun
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
that
the
earth
and
to
abstain
from
sustaining
teaching
or
defending
that
opinion
in
any
manner
whatever
orally
or
by
writing
galileo
bowed
to
this
order
was
allowed
to
retire
and
the
whole
proceeding
was
kept
secret
about
ten
days
later
on
march
the
congregation
of
the
index
moved
thereto
as
we
have
seen
and
as
the
letters
and
documents
now
brought
to
light
show
by
pope
paul
solemnly
rendered
their
decree
that
the
doctrine
of
the
double
movement
of
the
earth
about
its
axis
and
about
the
sun
is
and
entirely
contrary
to
holy
that
this
opinion
must
neither
be
taught
nor
defended
the
same
decree
condemned
the
writings
of
kopernik
and
writings
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
the
great
work
of
kopernik
was
interdicted
until
corrected
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
inquisition
and
the
works
of
galileo
and
kepler
though
not
mentioned
by
name
were
included
among
those
implicitly
condemned
as
affirming
the
motion
of
the
earth
the
condemnations
were
inscribed
upon
the
and
to
the
index
was
prefixed
the
usual
papal
bull
giving
its
monitions
the
papal
sanction
to
teach
or
even
read
the
works
denounced
or
passages
condemned
was
to
risk
persecution
in
this
world
and
damnation
in
the
next
human
science
had
apparently
lost
the
great
decisive
battle
for
some
time
galileo
remained
at
rome
perfectly
submissive
pope
paul
petted
him
and
all
seemed
happy
in
the
ending
of
the
long
war
but
returning
to
florence
something
of
his
old
scientific
ardor
stirred
within
him
and
at
last
cardinal
barberini
who
had
seemed
liberal
and
friendly
having
been
made
pope
under
the
name
of
urban
galileo
conceived
new
hopes
and
again
in
a
published
work
alluded
favorably
to
the
copernican
system
new
troubles
ensued
galileo
was
induced
to
visit
rome
again
and
pope
urban
tried
to
cajole
him
into
silence
and
personally
took
the
trouble
to
try
to
show
the
astronomer
his
errors
by
argument
other
opponents
were
less
considerate
works
appeared
attacking
his
ideas
works
all
the
more
unmanly
since
their
authors
knew
how
galileo
was
restrained
by
force
from
defending
himself
and
as
if
to
accumulate
proofs
of
the
fitness
of
the
church
to
take
charge
of
advanced
instruction
his
salary
as
professor
at
the
university
of
pisa
was
taken
from
him
sapping
and
mining
began
just
as
the
archbishop
of
pisa
some
years
before
had
tried
to
betray
galileo
with
honeyed
words
to
the
inquisition
so
now
father
grassi
tried
it
and
after
various
attempts
to
draw
him
out
by
flattery
suddenly
denounced
his
scientific
ideas
as
leading
to
a
denial
of
the
real
presence
in
the
eucharist
and
here
science
again
loses
ground
galileo
had
announced
his
intention
of
writing
upon
the
theory
of
the
tides
but
he
retreated
and
thus
was
lost
a
great
treatise
to
the
world
for
the
final
assault
the
park
of
heavy
artillery
was
at
last
wheeled
into
place
you
see
it
on
all
the
scientific
it
consists
of
general
denunciation
and
father
melchior
inchofer
of
the
jesuits
brought
his
artillery
to
bear
well
on
galileo
with
this
declaration
that
the
opinion
of
the
earth
motion
is
of
all
heresies
the
most
abominable
the
most
pernicious
the
most
scandalous
that
the
immobility
of
the
earth
is
thrice
sacred
that
argument
against
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
creator
the
incarnation
should
be
tolerated
sooner
than
an
argument
to
prove
that
the
earth
moves
but
this
state
of
things
could
not
be
endured
forever
urged
beyond
forbearance
galileo
prepares
a
careful
treatise
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
exhibiting
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
copernican
and
ptolemaic
systems
he
then
offers
to
submit
to
any
conditions
the
church
tribunals
may
impose
if
they
will
but
allow
it
to
be
printed
at
last
they
consent
imposing
the
most
humiliating
condition
of
all
which
was
a
preface
written
by
father
ricciardi
and
signed
by
galileo
in
which
the
whole
work
was
virtually
exhibited
as
a
play
of
the
imagination
and
not
at
all
as
opposed
to
the
truth
laid
down
in
by
the
inquisition
the
new
work
met
with
prodigious
success
it
put
new
weapons
into
the
hands
of
the
supporters
of
the
copernican
theory
the
preface
only
embittered
the
contest
it
was
laughed
at
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
as
ironical
this
aroused
the
enemy
the
jesuits
dominicans
and
the
great
majority
of
the
clergy
returned
to
the
attack
more
violent
than
ever
and
pope
urban
his
personal
pride
being
touched
after
some
halting
joined
the
clerical
forces
the
first
important
piece
of
strategy
was
to
forbid
the
sale
of
the
work
but
the
first
edition
had
already
been
exhausted
and
spread
throughout
europe
urban
now
became
angry
and
both
galileo
and
his
works
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
inquisition
in
vain
did
the
good
benedictine
castelli
urge
that
galileo
was
entirely
respectful
to
the
church
in
vain
did
he
say
that
nothing
that
could
be
done
could
now
hinder
the
earth
from
revolving
he
was
dismissed
and
galileo
was
forced
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
the
dread
tribunal
without
defender
or
adviser
there
as
was
so
long
concealed
but
as
is
now
fully
revealed
he
was
menaced
with
torture
by
express
order
of
pope
urban
and
as
is
now
thoroughly
established
by
documentary
evidence
forced
to
abjure
under
threats
and
subjected
to
imprisonment
by
command
of
urban
the
inquisition
deferring
in
the
most
servile
manner
to
the
papal
authority
the
rest
of
the
story
the
world
knows
by
heart
none
of
the
recent
attempts
have
succeeded
in
mystifying
it
the
whole
world
will
remember
forever
how
galileo
was
subjected
certainly
to
indignity
and
imprisonment
equivalent
to
physical
torture
how
he
was
at
last
forced
to
pronounce
publicly
and
on
his
knees
his
recantation
as
follows
i
galileo
being
in
my
seventieth
year
being
a
prisoner
and
on
my
knees
and
before
your
eminences
having
before
my
eyes
the
holy
gospel
which
i
touch
with
my
hands
abjure
curse
and
detest
the
error
and
the
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
he
was
vanquished
indeed
for
he
had
been
forced
in
the
face
of
all
coming
ages
to
perjure
himself
and
to
complete
his
dishonor
he
was
obliged
to
swear
to
denounce
to
the
inquisition
any
other
man
of
science
whom
he
should
discover
to
be
supporting
heresy
the
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
nor
was
this
all
to
the
end
of
his
life
nay
after
his
life
was
ended
this
bitter
persecution
was
continued
on
the
supposition
that
the
great
truths
he
revealed
were
hurtful
to
religion
after
a
brief
stay
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
he
was
kept
in
exile
from
family
friends
all
his
noble
employments
and
held
rigidly
to
his
promise
not
even
to
speak
of
his
theory
when
in
the
midst
of
intense
bodily
sufferings
from
disease
and
mental
sufferings
from
calamities
in
his
family
he
besought
some
little
liberty
he
was
met
with
threats
of
a
recommittal
to
his
dungeon
when
at
last
a
special
commissioner
had
reported
to
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
that
galileo
had
become
blind
and
wasted
away
with
disease
and
sorrow
he
was
allowed
but
little
more
liberty
and
that
little
tempered
by
the
close
surveillance
of
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
he
was
forced
to
bear
contemptible
attacks
on
himself
and
on
his
works
in
silence
he
lived
to
see
his
ideas
carefully
weeded
out
from
all
the
church
colleges
and
universities
in
europe
and
when
in
a
scientific
work
he
happened
to
be
spoken
of
as
renowned
the
inquisition
ordered
the
substitution
of
the
word
notorious
nor
did
the
persecution
cease
with
his
death
galileo
had
begged
to
be
buried
in
his
family
tomb
in
santa
croce
the
request
was
denied
his
friends
wished
to
erect
a
monument
over
him
this
too
was
refused
pope
urban
said
to
the
embassador
niccolini
that
it
would
be
an
evil
example
for
the
world
if
such
honors
were
rendered
to
a
man
who
had
been
brought
before
the
roman
inquisition
for
an
opinion
so
false
and
erroneous
who
had
communicated
it
to
many
others
and
who
had
given
so
great
a
scandal
to
christendom
in
accordance
therefore
with
the
wish
of
the
pope
and
the
orders
of
the
inquisition
galileo
was
buried
ignobly
apart
from
his
family
without
fitting
ceremony
without
monument
without
epitaph
not
until
forty
years
after
did
pierozzi
dare
to
write
his
epitaph
not
until
a
hundred
years
after
did
nelli
dare
transfer
his
remains
to
santa
croce
and
erect
above
them
a
suitable
monument
even
then
the
old
conscientious
hostility
burst
out
the
inquisition
was
besought
to
prevent
such
honors
to
a
man
condemned
for
notorious
errors
and
that
tribunal
refused
to
allow
any
epitaph
to
be
placed
above
him
which
had
not
first
been
submitted
to
its
censorship
nor
has
that
old
conscientious
consistency
in
hatred
yet
fully
relented
hardly
a
generation
since
has
not
seen
some
marini
or
de
bonald
or
rallaye
or
de
gabriac
suppressing
evidence
or
torturing
expressions
or
inventing
theories
to
blacken
the
memory
of
galileo
and
save
the
reputation
of
the
church
the
action
of
the
church
authorities
corresponded
well
to
the
spirit
thus
exhibited
not
until
over
one
hundred
years
after
his
condemnation
was
it
removed
and
then
secretly
not
until
over
two
hundred
years
after
his
condemnation
was
the
record
of
it
expunged
from
the
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
only
important
part
of
this
history
hardly
less
important
for
one
who
wishes
to
understand
the
character
of
the
warfare
of
science
is
it
to
go
back
over
those
two
hundred
years
between
that
fearful
crime
and
its
acknowledgment
and
study
the
great
retreat
of
the
army
of
the
church
after
its
disastrous
victory
over
galileo
having
gained
this
victory
the
conscientious
believers
in
the
bible
as
a
compendium
of
history
and
of
science
exulted
greatly
loud
was
the
rejoicing
that
the
heresy
the
infidelity
the
atheism
involved
in
believing
that
the
earth
revolves
about
its
axis
and
moves
around
the
sun
had
been
crushed
by
the
great
tribunal
of
the
church
acting
in
strict
obedience
to
the
expressed
will
of
one
pope
and
the
written
order
of
another
but
soon
men
saw
that
this
victory
was
a
disaster
from
all
sides
came
proofs
that
kopernik
and
galileo
were
right
and
although
pope
urban
and
the
inquisition
held
galileo
in
strict
seclusion
not
allowing
him
even
to
regarding
the
double
motion
of
the
earth
and
although
the
condemnation
of
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
was
kept
on
the
index
and
although
the
colleges
and
universities
under
church
control
were
compelled
to
teach
the
opposite
doctrine
it
was
seen
that
the
position
gained
by
the
victory
over
galileo
could
not
be
maintained
for
ever
so
began
the
great
retreat
the
retreat
of
the
army
of
church
apologists
through
two
centuries
of
sophistry
trickery
and
falsehood
the
first
important
move
in
the
retreat
was
a
falling
back
upon
the
statement
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
because
he
affirmed
the
motion
of
the
earth
but
because
he
supported
it
from
scripture
for
a
considerable
time
this
falsehood
served
its
purpose
even
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
galileo
condemnation
it
was
renewed
by
the
protestant
mallet
du
pan
in
his
wish
to
gain
favor
from
the
older
church
but
the
slightest
critical
examination
of
the
original
documents
recently
revealed
show
this
position
utterly
untenable
the
letters
of
galileo
to
castelli
and
the
christine
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
copernican
theory
as
reconcilable
with
scripture
were
not
published
until
after
the
condemnation
and
although
the
archbishop
of
pisa
had
endeavored
to
use
them
against
him
they
were
but
casually
mentioned
in
and
entirely
left
out
of
view
in
what
was
condemned
in
as
absurd
false
in
theology
and
heretical
because
absolutely
contrary
to
holy
scripture
was
the
proposition
that
sun
is
the
centre
about
which
the
earth
and
what
was
condemned
as
absurd
false
in
philosophy
and
from
a
theologic
point
of
view
at
least
opposed
to
the
true
faith
was
the
proposition
that
earth
is
not
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
immovable
but
has
a
diurnal
what
galileo
was
made
by
express
order
of
pope
urban
and
by
the
action
of
the
inquisition
under
threat
of
torture
to
abjure
was
error
and
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
what
the
prefaced
by
papal
bulls
binding
its
contents
upon
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
for
two
hundred
years
steadily
condemned
were
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
not
one
of
these
condemnations
was
directed
against
galileo
private
letters
to
castelli
and
christine
affirming
the
possibility
of
reconciling
his
ideas
to
scripture
having
been
dislodged
from
this
point
the
church
apologists
sought
cover
under
the
statement
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
for
heresy
but
for
contumacy
and
for
wanting
in
respect
for
the
pope
as
to
the
first
point
the
very
language
of
the
various
sentences
shows
the
falsehood
of
the
assertion
they
speak
of
heresy
and
never
of
contumacy
as
to
the
last
point
the
display
of
the
original
documents
settled
that
forever
it
was
proved
by
them
that
from
first
to
last
he
had
been
toward
the
pope
most
patient
and
submissive
he
had
indeed
expressed
his
anger
at
times
against
his
traducers
but
to
hold
this
the
cause
of
the
judgment
against
him
is
to
degrade
the
whole
proceeding
and
to
convict
the
pope
bellarmin
the
theologians
and
the
inquisition
of
direct
falsehood
since
they
assigned
entirely
different
reasons
for
their
conduct
from
this
therefore
the
apologists
hastily
retreated
the
next
rally
was
made
about
the
statement
that
the
persecution
of
galileo
was
the
result
of
a
quarrel
between
aristotelian
professors
on
one
side
and
professors
favoring
the
experimental
method
on
the
other
and
that
at
first
pope
urban
favored
galileo
but
this
position
was
attacked
and
carried
by
a
very
simple
statement
if
the
divine
guidance
of
the
church
is
such
a
sham
that
it
can
be
dragged
into
a
professional
squabble
and
the
pope
made
the
tool
of
a
faction
in
bringing
about
a
most
disastrous
condemnation
of
a
proven
truth
how
does
the
church
differ
from
any
human
organization
sunk
into
decrepitude
managed
by
simpletons
and
controlled
by
schemers
if
the
argument
be
true
the
condition
of
the
church
is
worse
than
its
enemies
have
declared
it
amid
the
jeers
of
an
unfeeling
world
the
apologists
sought
new
shelter
the
next
point
at
which
a
stand
was
made
was
the
assertion
that
the
condemnation
of
galileo
was
provisory
but
this
proved
a
more
treacherous
shelter
than
the
other
when
doctrines
have
been
solemnly
declared
as
those
of
galileo
were
solemnly
declared
contrary
to
the
sacred
scriptures
opposed
to
the
true
faith
and
false
and
absurd
in
theology
and
philosophy
to
say
that
such
declarations
are
provisory
is
to
say
that
the
truth
held
by
the
church
is
not
immutable
from
this
then
the
apologists
retreated
while
this
retreat
was
going
on
there
was
a
constant
discharge
of
in
the
shape
of
innuendoes
hints
and
small
sophistries
by
small
writers
every
effort
was
made
to
blacken
galileo
private
character
the
irregularities
of
his
early
life
were
dragged
forth
and
stress
was
laid
on
breaches
of
etiquette
but
this
succeeded
so
poorly
that
in
it
was
thought
necessary
by
the
roman
court
to
cover
their
retreat
by
some
more
careful
strategy
the
original
documents
of
the
trial
of
galileo
had
during
the
storms
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
been
transferred
to
paris
but
after
several
years
in
they
were
returned
to
rome
by
the
french
government
on
the
express
promise
by
the
papal
authorities
that
the
decisions
should
be
published
after
various
delays
on
various
pretexts
in
the
publication
appeared
the
ecclesiastic
charged
with
presenting
them
to
the
world
was
monsignor
marini
this
ecclesiastic
was
of
a
kind
which
has
too
often
afflicted
the
weary
earth
in
cunning
in
treachery
despite
the
solemn
promise
of
the
papal
court
the
wily
marini
became
the
instrument
of
the
roman
authority
in
evading
the
promise
by
suppressing
a
document
here
and
interpolating
a
statement
there
he
managed
to
give
plausible
for
nearly
every
important
sophistry
ever
broached
to
save
the
reputation
of
the
church
and
destroy
the
reputation
of
galileo
he
it
was
who
supported
the
idea
that
galileo
was
condemned
not
for
heresy
but
for
contumacy
and
various
other
assertions
as
groundless
the
first
effect
of
monsignor
marini
book
seemed
favorable
in
covering
the
retreat
of
the
church
aided
by
him
such
vigorous
writers
as
ward
were
able
to
throw
up
temporary
intrenchments
between
the
church
and
the
indignation
of
the
world
but
some
time
later
came
an
investigator
very
different
from
wily
monsignor
marini
this
man
was
a
frenchman
de
like
marini
de
was
devoted
to
the
church
but
unlike
marini
he
could
not
lie
having
obtained
access
in
to
the
galileo
documents
at
the
vatican
he
published
fully
all
those
of
importance
without
suppression
or
manipulation
this
made
all
the
intrenchments
based
upon
marini
statements
untenable
another
retreat
had
to
be
made
and
now
was
made
the
most
desperate
effort
of
all
the
apologistic
army
reviving
an
idea
which
popes
and
church
had
spurned
declared
that
the
pope
had
never
condemned
the
doctrines
of
kopernik
and
galileo
that
he
had
condemned
them
as
a
man
simply
that
therefore
the
church
had
never
been
committed
to
them
that
they
were
condemned
by
the
cardinals
of
the
inquisition
and
index
and
that
the
pope
had
evidently
been
restrained
from
signing
their
condemnation
by
providence
nothing
could
show
the
desperation
of
the
retreating
party
better
than
jugglery
like
this
the
facts
are
that
from
pope
urban
downward
among
the
church
authorities
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
decision
was
spoken
of
as
made
by
the
pope
and
the
church
urban
viii
spoke
of
that
of
as
made
by
pope
paul
and
the
church
and
of
that
of
as
made
by
himself
and
the
church
when
gassendi
attempted
to
raise
the
point
that
the
decision
was
not
sanctioned
by
the
church
as
such
a
great
theological
authority
father
lecazre
rector
of
the
college
of
dijon
publicly
contradicted
him
and
declared
that
it
was
not
certain
cardinals
but
the
supreme
authority
of
the
church
that
had
condemned
galileo
and
to
this
statement
the
pope
and
the
church
gave
consent
either
openly
or
by
silence
the
suspected
thinkers
like
descartes
and
others
who
attempted
to
raise
the
same
point
were
treated
with
contempt
father
castelli
who
had
devoted
himself
to
galileo
and
knew
to
his
cost
just
what
the
condemnation
meant
and
who
made
it
takes
it
for
granted
in
his
letter
to
the
papal
authorities
that
it
was
made
by
the
church
cardinal
querenghi
in
his
letters
the
embassador
guicciardini
in
his
dispatches
the
historian
viviani
in
his
biography
of
galileo
all
writing
under
church
inspection
at
the
time
take
the
view
that
the
church
condemned
galileo
the
inquisition
itself
backed
by
the
greatest
theologian
of
the
time
bellarmin
took
the
same
view
and
if
this
were
not
enough
we
have
the
roman
index
containing
the
condemnation
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
prefaced
by
a
solemn
bull
of
the
reigning
pope
binding
the
condemnation
on
the
consciences
of
the
whole
church
and
reiterating
year
after
year
the
condemnation
of
all
books
which
affirm
the
motion
of
the
earth
as
damnable
to
attempt
to
face
all
this
added
to
the
fact
that
the
inquisition
condemned
galileo
and
required
his
abjuration
of
the
heresy
of
the
movement
of
the
earth
by
written
order
of
the
pope
was
soon
seen
to
be
impossible
in
spite
then
of
all
the
casuistry
of
de
and
all
the
special
pleadings
of
martin
the
sturdy
of
the
world
proved
too
strong
and
now
comes
to
view
the
most
astounding
defense
of
all
that
hinted
at
by
viscount
de
bonald
and
developed
in
the
this
was
nothing
less
than
an
attempt
to
retreat
under
a
charge
of
deception
against
the
almighty
himself
the
argument
is
as
follows
but
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
the
church
did
retard
the
progress
of
scientific
truth
what
retarded
it
was
the
circumstance
that
god
has
thought
fit
to
express
many
texts
of
scripture
in
words
which
have
every
appearance
of
denying
the
earth
motion
but
it
is
god
who
did
this
not
the
church
and
moreover
since
he
thought
fit
so
to
act
as
to
retard
the
progress
of
scientific
truth
it
would
be
little
to
her
discredit
even
if
it
were
true
that
she
had
followed
his
example
with
this
the
retreat
of
the
army
of
apologists
is
complete
further
than
this
through
mazes
of
sophistry
and
into
depths
of
contempt
they
could
not
go
do
not
understand
me
here
as
casting
blame
on
the
roman
church
at
large
it
must
in
fairness
be
said
that
some
of
its
best
men
tried
to
stop
this
great
mistake
even
pope
urban
himself
would
have
been
glad
at
one
time
to
stop
it
but
the
current
was
too
strong
and
he
weakly
yielded
becoming
a
bitter
persecutor
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
was
at
fault
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
and
not
any
particular
part
of
it
it
was
not
the
fault
of
religion
it
was
the
fault
of
the
views
which
men
are
ever
prone
to
mix
in
with
religion
and
to
insist
are
religion
but
the
losses
to
the
earth
in
the
long
war
against
galileo
were
followed
by
losses
not
less
unfortunate
in
other
quarters
there
was
then
in
europe
one
of
the
greatest
thinkers
ever
given
to
mankind
réné
descartes
mistaken
though
many
of
his
theories
were
they
were
fruitful
in
truths
the
scientific
warriors
had
stirred
new
life
in
him
and
he
was
working
over
and
summing
up
in
his
mighty
mind
all
the
researches
of
his
time
the
result
must
make
an
epoch
in
history
his
aim
was
to
combine
all
knowledge
and
thought
into
a
treatise
on
the
world
his
earnestness
he
proved
by
the
eleven
years
which
he
gave
to
the
study
of
anatomy
alone
petty
persecution
he
had
met
often
but
the
fate
of
galileo
robbed
him
of
all
hope
of
all
energy
the
battle
seemed
lost
he
gave
up
his
great
plan
forever
but
champions
pressed
on
campanella
full
of
vagaries
as
he
was
wrote
his
pro
though
for
that
and
other
heresies
religious
and
political
he
seven
times
underwent
torture
and
kepler
comes
he
leads
science
on
to
greater
victories
kopernik
great
as
he
was
could
not
disentangle
his
scientific
reasoning
entirely
from
the
theological
bias
the
doctrines
of
aristotle
and
thomas
aquinas
as
to
the
necessary
superiority
of
the
circle
had
vitiated
the
minor
features
of
his
system
and
left
breaches
in
it
through
which
the
enemy
was
not
slow
to
enter
kepler
sees
these
errors
and
by
wonderful
genius
in
insight
and
vigor
in
thought
he
brings
to
the
world
the
three
laws
which
bear
his
name
and
this
fortress
of
science
is
complete
he
thinks
and
speaks
as
one
inspired
his
battle
is
severe
he
is
sometimes
abused
sometimes
ridiculed
sometimes
imprisoned
protestants
in
styria
and
at
tübingen
catholics
at
rome
press
upon
him
but
newton
halley
bradley
and
the
other
great
leaders
follow
and
to
science
remains
the
victory
and
yet
the
war
did
not
wholly
end
during
the
seventeenth
century
in
all
france
after
all
the
splendid
proofs
added
by
kepler
no
one
dared
openly
teach
the
copernican
theory
and
cassini
the
great
astronomer
never
declared
it
in
father
riccioli
a
jesuit
declared
that
there
were
precisely
arguments
for
the
copernican
theory
and
against
it
so
that
there
remained
reasons
for
preferring
the
orthodox
theory
toward
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
after
the
demonstration
of
sir
isaac
newton
even
bossuet
the
eagle
of
meaux
among
the
loftiest
of
religious
thinkers
declared
for
the
ptolemaic
theory
as
the
scriptural
theory
and
in
john
hutchinson
published
in
england
his
maintaining
that
the
hebrew
scriptures
are
a
perfect
system
of
natural
philosophy
and
are
opposed
to
the
newtonian
theory
of
gravitation
in
boscovich
the
great
mathematician
of
the
jesuits
used
these
words
as
for
me
full
of
respect
for
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
decree
of
the
holy
inquisition
i
regard
the
earth
as
immovable
nevertheless
for
simplicity
in
explanation
i
will
argue
as
if
the
earth
moves
for
it
is
proved
that
of
the
two
hypotheses
the
appearances
favor
that
idea
and
even
at
a
date
far
within
our
own
nineteenth
century
the
authorities
of
the
spanish
universities
vigorously
excluded
the
newtonian
system
and
the
greatest
of
them
all
the
university
of
salamanca
held
it
under
the
ban
until
a
very
recent
period
nor
has
the
opposition
failed
even
in
our
own
time
on
the
of
may
a
great
multitude
assembled
at
warsaw
to
do
honor
to
the
memory
of
kopernik
and
to
unveil
thorwaldsen
statue
of
him
kopernik
had
lived
a
pious
christian
life
he
was
well
known
for
unostentatious
christian
charity
with
his
religious
belief
no
fault
had
ever
been
found
he
was
a
canon
of
the
church
of
frauenberg
and
over
his
grave
had
been
written
the
most
touching
of
christian
epitaphs
naturally
then
the
people
expected
a
religious
service
all
was
understood
to
be
arranged
for
it
the
procession
marched
to
the
church
and
waited
the
hour
passed
and
no
priest
appeared
none
could
be
induced
to
appear
kopernik
simple
charitable
pious
one
of
the
noblest
gifts
of
god
to
the
service
of
religion
as
well
as
science
was
still
held
to
be
a
reprobate
five
years
after
that
his
book
was
still
standing
on
the
index
of
books
prohibited
to
christians
and
although
in
under
benedict
the
congregation
of
the
index
had
secretly
allowed
the
ideas
of
kopernik
and
galileo
to
be
simply
tolerated
it
was
not
until
as
we
have
seen
that
pius
vii
allowed
the
publishing
of
them
at
rome
and
not
until
did
the
prohibition
of
them
fully
disappear
from
the
index
the
protestantism
of
england
was
little
better
in
sailed
the
famous
english
expedition
for
scientific
discovery
under
cook
the
greatest
by
far
of
all
the
scientific
authorities
chosen
to
accompany
it
was
priestley
sir
joseph
banks
had
especially
invited
him
but
the
clergy
of
oxford
and
cambridge
intervened
priestley
was
considered
unsound
in
his
views
of
the
trinity
it
was
suspected
that
this
would
vitiate
his
astronomical
observations
he
was
rejected
and
the
expedition
crippled
nor
has
the
warfare
against
dead
champions
of
science
been
carried
on
only
by
the
older
church
on
the
of
may
was
buried
alexander
von
humboldt
his
labors
were
among
the
greatest
glories
of
the
century
and
his
funeral
one
of
the
most
imposing
that
berlin
had
ever
seen
among
those
who
honored
themselves
by
their
presence
was
the
prince
regent
the
present
emperor
but
of
the
clergy
it
was
observed
that
none
were
present
save
the
officiating
clergyman
and
a
few
regarded
as
unorthodox
nor
have
attempts
to
renew
the
battle
been
wanting
in
these
latter
days
the
attempt
in
the
church
of
england
in
to
fetter
science
which
was
brought
to
ridicule
by
herschel
bowring
and
de
morgan
the
lutheran
assemblage
at
berlin
in
to
protest
against
science
falsely
so
called
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
pastor
knak
denouncing
the
copernican
theory
the
syllabus
the
greatest
mistake
of
the
roman
church
are
all
examples
of
this
and
now
what
has
been
won
by
either
party
in
this
long
and
terrible
war
the
party
which
would
subordinate
the
methods
and
aims
of
science
to
those
of
theology
though
in
general
obedient
to
deep
convictions
had
given
to
christianity
a
series
of
the
worst
blows
it
had
ever
received
they
had
made
large
numbers
of
the
best
men
in
europe
hate
it
why
did
ricetto
and
bruno
and
vanini
when
the
crucifix
was
presented
to
them
in
their
hours
of
martyrdom
turn
from
that
blessed
image
with
loathing
simply
because
christianity
had
been
made
to
them
identical
with
the
most
horrible
oppression
of
the
mind
worse
than
that
the
defenders
of
the
faith
had
wrought
into
the
very
fibre
of
the
european
heart
that
most
unfortunate
of
all
ideas
the
idea
that
there
is
a
necessary
antagonism
between
science
and
religion
like
the
landsman
who
lashes
himself
to
the
anchor
of
the
sinking
ship
they
had
attached
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
christianity
by
the
strongest
cords
of
logic
which
they
could
spin
to
these
mistaken
ideas
in
science
and
the
advance
of
knowledge
had
wellnigh
engulfed
them
on
the
other
hand
what
had
science
done
for
religion
simply
this
kopernik
escaping
persecution
only
by
death
giordano
bruno
burned
alive
as
a
monster
of
impiety
galileo
imprisoned
and
humiliated
as
the
worst
of
misbelievers
kepler
hunted
alike
by
protestant
and
catholic
had
given
to
religion
great
new
foundations
great
new
ennobling
conceptions
a
great
new
revelation
of
the
might
of
god
under
the
old
system
we
have
that
princely
astronomer
alfonso
of
castile
seeing
the
poverty
of
the
ptolemaic
system
yet
knowing
no
other
startling
europe
with
the
blasphemy
that
if
he
had
been
present
at
creation
he
could
have
suggested
a
better
ordering
of
the
heavenly
bodies
under
the
new
system
you
have
kepler
filled
with
a
religious
spirit
exclaiming
i
do
think
the
thoughts
of
god
the
difference
in
religious
spirit
between
these
two
men
marks
the
conquest
made
in
this
even
by
science
for
religion
but
we
can
not
leave
the
subject
of
astronomy
without
noticing
the
most
recent
warfare
especially
interesting
is
it
because
at
one
period
the
battle
seemed
utterly
lost
and
then
was
won
beautifully
thoroughly
by
a
legitimate
advance
in
scientific
knowledge
i
speak
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
the
sacred
writings
of
the
jews
which
we
have
inherited
speak
literally
of
the
creation
of
the
heavenly
bodies
by
direct
intervention
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
earth
this
was
the
view
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
was
transmitted
through
the
great
doctors
in
theology
more
than
that
it
was
crystallized
in
art
so
have
i
seen
over
the
portal
of
the
cathedral
of
freiburg
a
representation
of
the
almighty
making
and
placing
numbers
of
suns
moons
and
stars
and
at
the
centre
of
all
and
largest
of
all
the
earth
the
lines
on
the
creator
face
show
that
he
is
obliged
to
contrive
the
lines
of
his
muscles
show
that
he
is
obliged
to
toil
naturally
then
did
sculptors
and
painters
of
the
mediæval
and
early
modern
period
represent
the
almighty
as
weary
after
labor
and
enjoying
dignified
repose
these
ideas
more
or
less
gross
in
their
accompaniments
passed
into
the
popular
creed
of
the
modern
period
but
about
the
close
of
the
last
century
bruno
having
guessed
the
fundamental
fact
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
and
kant
having
reasoned
out
its
foundation
idea
laplace
developed
it
showing
the
reason
for
supposing
that
our
own
solar
system
in
its
sun
planets
satellites
with
their
various
motions
distances
and
magnitudes
is
a
natural
result
of
the
diminishing
heat
of
a
nebulous
mass
a
result
obeying
natural
laws
there
was
an
outcry
at
once
against
the
atheism
of
the
scheme
the
war
raged
fiercely
laplace
claimed
that
there
were
in
the
heavens
many
nebulous
patches
yet
in
the
gaseous
form
and
pointed
them
out
he
showed
by
laws
of
physics
and
mathematical
demonstration
that
his
hypothesis
accounted
in
a
most
striking
manner
for
the
great
body
of
facts
and
despite
clamor
was
gaining
ground
when
the
improved
telescopes
resolved
some
of
the
patches
of
nebulous
matter
into
multitudes
of
stars
the
opponents
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
were
overjoyed
they
sang
pæans
to
astronomy
because
as
they
said
it
had
proved
the
truth
of
scripture
they
had
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
all
nebulæ
must
be
alike
that
if
are
made
up
of
systems
of
stars
must
be
so
made
up
that
none
can
be
masses
of
attenuated
gaseous
matter
because
some
are
not
science
for
a
time
halted
the
accepted
doctrine
became
this
that
the
only
reason
why
all
the
nebulæ
are
not
resolved
into
distinct
stars
is
because
our
telescopes
are
not
sufficiently
powerful
but
in
time
came
that
wonderful
discovery
of
the
spectroscope
and
spectrum
analysis
and
this
was
supplemented
by
fraunhofer
discovery
that
the
spectrum
of
an
ignited
gaseous
body
is
discontinuous
with
interrupting
lines
and
this
in
by
draper
discovery
that
the
spectrum
of
an
ignited
solid
is
continuous
with
no
interrupting
lines
and
now
the
spectroscope
was
turned
upon
the
nebulæ
and
about
of
them
were
found
to
be
gaseous
again
the
nebular
hypothesis
comes
forth
stronger
than
ever
the
beautiful
experiment
of
plateau
on
the
rotation
of
a
fluid
globe
comes
in
to
strengthen
if
not
to
confirm
it
but
what
was
likely
to
be
lost
in
this
simply
a
poor
conception
of
the
universe
what
to
be
gained
a
far
more
worthy
idea
of
that
vast
power
which
works
in
the
universe
in
all
things
by
law
and
in
none
by
caprice
chemistry
and
physics
the
great
series
of
battles
to
which
i
next
turn
with
you
were
fought
on
those
fields
occupied
by
such
sciences
as
chemistry
and
natural
philosophy
even
before
these
sciences
were
out
of
their
childhood
while
yet
they
were
tottering
mainly
toward
childish
objects
and
by
childish
steps
the
champions
of
that
same
old
mistaken
conception
of
rigid
scriptural
interpretation
began
the
war
the
catalogue
of
chemists
and
physicists
persecuted
or
thwarted
would
fill
volumes
the
first
entrance
of
these
sciences
as
a
force
into
the
modern
world
began
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
the
thirteenth
century
was
marked
by
a
revival
of
religious
fervor
to
this
day
the
greatest
and
best
works
of
the
are
memorials
of
its
depth
and
strength
out
of
this
religious
fervor
naturally
came
a
great
growth
of
theological
thought
and
ecclesiastical
power
and
the
spirit
of
inquiry
was
soon
obliged
to
take
account
of
this
influence
first
among
the
distinguished
men
who
in
that
century
laid
foundations
for
modern
science
was
albert
of
bollstadt
better
known
as
albert
the
great
the
most
renowned
scholar
of
germany
fettered
though
he
was
by
the
absurd
methods
of
his
time
led
astray
as
he
was
by
the
scholastic
spirit
he
had
conceived
ideas
of
better
methods
and
aims
his
eye
pierces
the
mists
of
scholasticism
he
sees
the
light
and
draws
the
world
toward
it
he
stands
among
the
great
pioneers
of
modern
physical
and
natural
science
he
aids
in
giving
foundations
to
botany
and
chemistry
and
humboldt
finds
in
his
works
the
germ
of
the
comprehensive
science
of
physical
geography
the
conscience
of
the
time
acting
as
it
supposed
in
defense
of
religion
brought
out
a
missile
which
it
hurled
with
deadly
effect
you
see
those
mediæval
scientific
strewed
with
such
it
was
the
charge
of
sorcery
of
unlawful
compact
with
the
devil
this
missile
was
effective
you
find
it
used
against
every
great
investigator
of
nature
in
those
times
and
for
centuries
after
the
list
of
great
men
charged
with
magic
as
given
by
naudé
is
astounding
it
includes
every
man
of
real
mark
and
the
most
thoughtful
of
the
popes
sylvester
ii
gerbert
stands
in
the
midst
of
them
it
seemed
to
be
the
received
idea
that
as
soon
as
a
man
conceived
a
wish
to
study
the
works
of
god
his
first
step
must
be
a
league
with
the
devil
this
missile
was
hurled
against
albert
he
was
condemned
by
the
authorities
of
the
dominican
order
subjected
to
suspicion
and
indignity
and
only
escaped
persecution
by
yielding
to
the
ecclesiastical
spirit
of
the
time
and
working
mainly
in
theological
channels
by
scholastic
methods
it
was
a
sad
loss
to
the
earth
and
certainly
of
all
organizations
that
have
reason
to
lament
the
pressure
of
those
ecclesiastical
forces
which
turned
albert
the
great
from
the
path
of
experimental
philosophy
foremost
of
all
in
regret
should
be
the
christian
church
and
especially
the
roman
branch
of
it
had
the
church
of
the
thirteenth
century
been
so
full
of
faith
as
to
accept
the
truths
in
natural
science
brought
by
albert
and
his
compeers
and
to
have
encouraged
their
growth
this
faith
and
this
encouragement
would
to
this
day
have
formed
the
greatest
argument
for
proving
the
church
directly
under
divine
guidance
they
would
have
been
the
brightest
jewels
in
her
crown
the
loss
to
the
church
by
this
want
of
faith
and
courage
has
proved
in
the
even
greater
than
the
loss
to
science
the
next
great
man
of
that
age
whom
the
theological
and
ecclesiastical
forces
of
the
time
turn
from
the
right
path
is
vincent
of
beauvais
vincent
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
nature
in
several
of
her
most
interesting
fields
to
astronomy
mineralogy
botany
and
chemistry
he
gave
much
thought
but
especially
did
he
devote
himself
to
the
preparation
of
a
full
account
of
the
universe
had
he
taken
the
path
of
experimental
research
the
world
would
have
been
enriched
with
most
precious
discoveries
but
the
impulse
followed
by
albert
of
bollstadt
backed
as
it
was
by
the
whole
ecclesiastical
power
of
his
time
was
too
strong
and
in
all
the
of
vincent
nothing
appears
of
any
permanent
value
he
built
a
structure
which
careless
observation
of
facts
literal
interpretation
of
scripture
and
theological
subtilizing
combined
to
make
one
of
the
most
striking
monuments
of
human
error
but
the
theological
ecclesiastical
spirit
of
the
thirteenth
century
gained
its
greatest
victory
in
the
work
of
the
most
renowned
of
all
thinkers
of
his
time
thomas
aquinas
in
him
was
the
theological
spirit
of
his
age
incarnate
although
he
yielded
somewhat
at
one
period
to
love
of
studies
in
natural
science
it
was
he
who
finally
made
that
great
treaty
or
compromise
which
for
ages
subjected
science
entirely
to
theology
he
it
was
whose
thought
reared
the
most
enduring
barrier
against
those
who
in
that
age
and
in
succeeding
ages
labored
to
open
for
science
the
path
by
its
own
legitimate
method
toward
its
own
noble
ends
through
the
earlier
systems
of
philosophy
as
they
were
then
known
and
through
the
earlier
theologic
thought
he
had
gone
with
great
labor
and
vigor
he
had
been
a
pupil
of
albert
of
bollstadt
and
from
him
had
gained
inspiration
in
science
all
his
mighty
powers
thus
disciplined
and
cultured
he
brought
to
bear
in
making
a
treaty
or
truce
giving
to
theology
the
supremacy
over
science
the
experimental
method
had
already
been
practically
initiated
albert
of
bollstadt
and
roger
bacon
had
begun
their
work
in
accordance
with
its
methods
but
thomas
aquinas
gave
all
his
thoughts
to
bringing
science
again
under
the
sway
of
the
theological
bias
metaphysical
methods
and
ecclesiastical
control
he
gave
to
the
world
a
striking
example
of
what
his
method
could
be
made
to
produce
in
his
commentary
upon
treatise
upon
heaven
and
earth
he
illustrates
all
the
evils
of
such
a
combination
of
theological
reasoning
and
literal
interpretation
of
the
scriptural
with
scientific
facts
as
then
understood
and
it
remains
to
this
day
a
prodigious
monument
to
human
genius
and
human
folly
the
ecclesiastical
power
of
the
time
hailed
him
as
a
deliverer
it
was
claimed
that
striking
miracles
were
vouchsafed
showing
that
the
blessing
of
heaven
rested
upon
his
labors
among
the
legends
embodying
the
church
spirit
of
that
period
is
that
given
by
the
bollandists
and
immortalized
by
a
renowned
painter
the
great
philosopher
and
saint
is
represented
in
the
habit
of
his
order
with
book
and
pen
in
hand
kneeling
before
the
image
of
christ
crucified
and
as
he
kneels
the
image
thus
addresses
him
thomas
thou
hast
written
well
concerning
me
what
price
wilt
thou
receive
for
thy
labor
to
this
day
the
greater
ecclesiastical
historians
of
the
roman
church
like
the
abbé
rohrbacher
and
the
minor
historians
of
science
who
find
it
convenient
to
propitiate
the
church
like
pouchet
dilate
upon
the
glories
of
thomas
aquinas
in
thus
making
a
treaty
of
alliance
between
religious
and
scientific
thought
and
laying
the
foundations
for
a
sanctified
science
but
the
unprejudiced
historian
can
not
indulge
in
this
enthusiastic
view
the
results
both
for
the
church
and
for
the
progress
of
science
have
been
most
unfortunate
it
was
a
wretched
step
backward
the
first
result
of
this
great
man
great
compromise
was
to
close
that
new
path
in
science
which
alone
leads
to
discoveries
of
value
the
experimental
method
and
to
reopen
the
old
path
of
mixed
theology
and
science
which
as
hallam
declares
after
three
or
four
hundred
years
had
not
untied
a
single
knot
or
added
one
unequivocal
truth
to
the
domain
of
philosophy
the
path
which
as
all
modern
history
proves
has
ever
since
led
only
to
delusion
and
evil
the
path
thus
unfortunately
opened
by
these
strong
men
became
the
main
path
in
science
for
ages
and
it
led
the
world
farther
and
farther
from
any
fruitful
fact
or
hopeful
method
roger
bacon
investigations
were
virtually
forgotten
worthless
mixtures
of
literal
interpretation
of
scripture
with
imperfectly
authenticated
physical
facts
took
their
place
every
age
since
has
been
full
of
examples
of
this
but
out
of
them
i
will
take
just
one
and
it
shall
be
no
other
than
that
francis
bacon
who
more
than
any
other
man
led
the
modern
world
out
of
the
path
opened
by
aquinas
and
back
into
the
path
trod
by
roger
bacon
strange
as
it
may
at
first
seem
francis
bacon
whose
keenness
of
sight
revealed
the
delusions
of
the
old
path
and
the
promises
of
the
new
that
man
whose
boldness
in
thought
did
so
much
to
turn
the
world
from
the
old
path
into
the
new
presents
in
his
own
writings
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
the
strength
of
the
evil
he
did
so
much
to
destroy
the
considering
the
time
when
it
came
from
his
pen
is
doubtless
one
of
the
greatest
exhibitions
of
genius
in
the
history
of
human
thought
this
treatise
it
was
which
showed
the
modern
world
the
way
out
of
the
scholastic
method
and
reverence
for
dogma
into
the
experimental
method
and
reverence
for
demonstrated
fact
in
the
course
of
it
occur
many
passages
which
show
that
the
great
philosopher
was
fully
alive
to
the
danger
both
to
religion
and
to
science
arising
from
their
mixture
early
in
his
argument
he
says
but
the
corruption
of
philosophy
from
superstition
and
admixture
of
theology
separates
altogether
more
widely
and
introduces
the
greatest
amount
of
evil
both
into
whole
systems
of
philosophy
and
into
their
parts
and
a
little
later
he
says
some
moderns
have
indulged
this
vanity
with
the
greatest
carelessness
and
have
endeavored
to
found
a
natural
philosophy
on
the
first
of
genesis
and
the
book
of
job
and
other
sacred
scriptures
so
the
dead
among
the
living
and
by
so
much
the
more
is
this
vanity
to
be
restrained
and
coerced
because
their
expressions
form
an
unwholesome
mixture
of
things
human
and
divine
not
merely
fantastic
philosophy
but
heretical
religion
and
so
it
is
very
salutary
that
with
due
sobriety
of
mind
those
things
only
be
rendered
to
faith
which
are
faith
still
later
in
his
treatise
bacon
returns
to
the
charge
yet
more
strongly
he
says
nor
is
it
to
be
overlooked
that
natural
philosophy
has
in
all
ages
had
a
troublesome
and
stubborn
adversary
in
superstition
and
the
blind
and
immoderate
zeal
for
religion
thus
it
has
been
among
the
greeks
that
they
who
first
proposed
to
the
yet
unprepared
ears
of
men
the
natural
causes
of
lightning
and
tempests
were
condemned
on
that
head
for
impiety
toward
the
gods
nor
by
some
of
the
old
fathers
of
the
christian
religion
were
those
much
better
received
who
laid
it
down
from
the
most
sure
demonstrations
such
as
no
one
in
his
senses
could
nowadays
contradict
that
the
earth
is
round
and
asserted
in
consequence
that
there
must
be
antipodes
furthermore
as
things
are
now
the
condition
of
discourses
on
nature
is
made
severe
and
more
rigorous
in
consequence
of
the
summaries
and
methods
of
scholastic
theologians
who
while
they
have
as
far
as
they
could
reduced
theology
to
order
and
have
fashioned
it
into
the
form
of
an
art
have
besides
succeeded
in
mingling
far
more
than
was
right
of
the
quarrelsome
and
thorny
philosophy
of
aristotle
with
the
body
of
religion
the
fictions
too
of
those
who
have
not
feared
to
deduce
and
confirm
from
the
principles
and
authority
of
philosophies
the
true
christian
religion
have
the
same
tendency
though
in
a
different
way
these
celebrated
the
wedding
of
faith
and
sense
as
though
it
were
lawful
with
much
pomp
and
solemnity
and
soothed
the
minds
of
men
with
a
grateful
variety
of
things
but
meanwhile
mingled
the
divine
with
the
human
in
state
and
in
mixtures
like
this
of
theology
with
natural
philosophy
those
things
only
which
are
now
received
in
philosophy
are
included
while
novelties
though
they
be
changes
for
the
better
are
all
banished
and
driven
out
and
again
bacon
says
lastly
you
may
find
thanks
to
the
unskillfulness
of
some
divines
the
approach
to
any
kind
of
philosophy
however
improved
entirely
closed
up
some
indeed
in
their
simplicity
are
rather
afraid
lest
perhaps
a
deeper
inquiry
into
nature
should
penetrate
beyond
the
allowed
limits
of
sobriety
still
further
on
bacon
penetrates
into
the
very
heart
of
the
question
in
a
vigorous
way
and
says
others
more
craftily
conjecture
and
consider
that
if
the
means
be
unknown
each
single
thing
can
be
referred
more
easily
to
the
hand
and
rod
of
god
a
matter
as
they
think
of
very
great
importance
to
religion
and
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
wishing
to
god
by
a
and
finally
he
says
whereas
if
one
considers
the
matter
rightly
natural
philosophy
is
after
god
word
the
surest
medicine
for
superstition
and
also
the
most
approved
nourishment
of
faith
no
man
who
has
thought
much
upon
the
annals
of
his
race
can
without
a
feeling
of
awe
come
into
the
presence
of
such
inspired
clearness
of
insight
and
boldness
of
utterance
the
first
thought
of
the
reader
is
that
of
all
men
this
francis
bacon
is
the
most
free
from
the
unfortunate
bias
he
condemns
he
certainly
can
not
be
deluded
into
the
old
path
but
as
we
go
on
through
the
treatise
we
are
surprised
to
find
that
the
strong
arm
of
aquinas
had
been
stretched
over
the
intervening
ages
and
had
laid
hold
upon
this
of
the
sixteenth
century
only
a
few
chapters
further
along
we
find
bacon
after
alluding
to
the
then
recent
voyage
of
columbus
speaking
of
the
prophecy
of
daniel
regarding
the
latter
days
that
many
shall
run
to
and
fro
and
knowledge
be
increased
as
clearly
signifying
that
it
is
in
the
fates
in
providence
that
the
circumnavigation
of
the
world
which
through
so
many
lengthy
voyages
seems
to
be
entirely
complete
or
in
course
of
completion
and
the
increase
of
science
should
happen
in
the
same
age
here
then
we
have
this
great
man
indulging
in
that
very
mixture
of
literal
scriptural
interpretation
and
scientific
thought
which
he
had
condemned
and
therefrom
evidently
deducing
the
conclusion
that
these
great
voyages
and
discoveries
which
were
the
beginning
of
a
new
world
in
thought
and
action
were
the
end
of
all
things
but
in
his
great
work
on
advancement
of
the
firm
grip
which
the
methods
he
condemned
held
upon
him
is
shown
yet
more
clearly
in
his
first
book
he
shows
how
that
excellent
book
of
job
if
it
be
revolved
with
diligence
it
will
be
found
pregnant
and
swelling
with
natural
philosophy
and
endeavors
to
show
that
the
roundness
of
the
world
the
fixing
of
the
stars
ever
standing
at
equal
distance
the
depression
of
the
southern
pole
matter
of
generation
and
matter
of
minerals
are
with
great
elegancy
noted
but
curiously
enough
he
uses
to
support
some
of
these
truths
the
very
texts
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
used
to
destroy
them
and
those
for
which
he
finds
scriptural
warrant
most
clearly
are
such
as
science
has
since
disproved
so
too
he
says
that
solomon
was
enabled
by
donation
of
god
in
his
proverbs
to
compile
a
natural
history
of
all
verdure
certainly
no
more
striking
examples
of
the
strength
of
the
evil
which
he
had
all
along
been
denouncing
could
be
exhibited
than
these
in
his
own
writings
after
this
we
cease
to
wonder
at
his
blindness
to
the
discoveries
of
kopernik
and
the
experiments
of
gilbert
i
pass
from
the
legions
of
those
who
from
that
day
to
this
have
stumbled
into
similar
errors
by
degrading
our
sacred
volume
into
a
compendium
of
history
or
a
of
science
and
turn
next
to
a
far
more
serious
class
of
effects
arising
from
the
great
mediæval
compromise
between
science
and
theology
we
have
considered
the
wrong
road
into
which
so
many
were
led
or
driven
we
will
now
look
at
the
war
brought
against
those
men
of
science
who
persevered
in
the
right
road
the
first
great
thinker
who
in
spite
of
some
stumbling
into
theologic
pitfalls
persevered
in
this
true
path
was
roger
bacon
his
life
and
works
seem
until
recently
to
have
been
generally
misunderstood
he
has
been
ranked
as
a
superstitious
alchemist
who
stumbled
upon
some
inventions
but
more
recent
investigation
has
revealed
him
to
be
one
of
the
great
masters
in
human
progress
the
advance
of
sound
historical
judgment
seems
likely
to
bring
nearer
to
equality
the
fame
of
the
two
who
bear
the
name
of
bacon
bacon
of
the
chancellorship
and
the
may
not
wane
but
bacon
of
the
and
the
steadily
approaches
him
in
brightness
more
than
three
centuries
before
francis
bacon
advocated
the
experimental
method
roger
bacon
practised
it
and
the
results
as
now
revealed
are
wonderful
he
wrought
with
power
in
philosophy
and
in
all
sciences
and
his
knowledge
was
sound
and
exact
by
him
more
than
by
any
other
man
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
world
put
on
the
most
fruitful
paths
of
science
the
paths
which
have
led
to
the
most
precious
inventions
among
them
are
clocks
lenses
burning
specula
telescopes
which
were
given
by
him
to
the
world
directly
or
indirectly
in
his
writings
are
found
formulæ
for
extracting
phosphorus
manganese
and
bismuth
it
is
even
claimed
with
much
appearance
of
justice
that
he
investigated
the
power
of
steam
he
seems
to
have
very
nearly
reached
also
some
of
the
principal
doctrines
of
modern
chemistry
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
his
method
of
investigation
was
even
greater
than
these
vast
results
in
the
age
when
metaphysical
subtilizing
was
alone
thought
to
give
the
title
of
scholar
he
insisted
on
reasoning
and
the
aid
of
natural
science
by
mathematics
in
an
age
when
experimenting
was
sure
to
cost
a
man
his
reputation
and
was
likely
to
cost
him
his
life
he
insisted
on
experiment
and
braved
all
its
risks
few
greater
men
have
lived
as
we
read
the
sketch
given
by
whewell
of
bacon
process
of
reasoning
regarding
the
refraction
of
light
he
seems
fairly
inspired
on
this
man
came
the
brunt
of
the
battle
the
most
conscientious
men
of
his
time
thought
it
their
duty
to
fight
him
and
they
did
it
too
well
it
was
not
that
he
disbelieved
in
christianity
was
never
charged
against
him
his
orthodoxy
was
perfect
he
was
attacked
and
condemned
in
the
words
of
his
opponents
quasdam
novitates
he
was
attacked
first
of
all
with
that
goodly
old
missile
which
with
the
epithets
infidel
and
atheist
has
decided
the
fate
of
so
many
battles
the
charge
of
magic
and
compact
with
satan
he
defended
himself
with
a
most
unfortunate
weapon
a
weapon
which
exploded
in
his
hands
and
injured
him
more
than
the
enemy
for
he
argued
against
the
idea
of
compacts
with
satan
and
showed
that
much
which
is
ascribed
to
demons
results
from
natural
means
this
added
fuel
to
the
flame
to
limit
the
power
of
satan
was
deemed
hardly
less
impious
than
to
limit
the
power
of
god
the
most
powerful
protectors
availed
him
little
his
friend
guy
foulkes
having
been
made
pope
bacon
was
for
a
time
shielded
but
the
fury
of
the
enemy
was
too
strong
in
an
unpublished
letter
blackstone
declares
that
when
on
one
occasion
bacon
was
about
to
perform
a
few
experiments
for
some
friends
all
oxford
was
in
an
uproar
it
was
believed
that
satan
was
let
loose
everywhere
were
priests
fellows
and
students
rushing
about
their
garments
streaming
in
the
wind
and
everywhere
resounded
the
cry
down
with
the
conjurer
and
this
cry
down
with
the
conjurer
resounded
from
cell
to
cell
and
hall
to
hall
but
the
attack
took
a
shape
far
more
terrible
the
two
great
religions
orders
franciscan
and
dominican
vied
with
each
other
in
fighting
the
new
thought
in
chemistry
and
philosophy
dominic
sincere
as
he
was
solemnly
condemned
research
by
experiment
and
observation
the
general
of
the
franciscan
order
took
similar
grounds
in
the
dominicans
solemnly
interdicted
every
member
of
their
order
from
the
study
of
medicine
and
natural
philosophy
and
in
this
interdiction
was
extended
to
the
study
of
chemistry
in
the
authorities
of
the
franciscan
order
assembled
at
paris
solemnly
condemned
bacon
teachings
another
weapon
began
to
be
used
upon
the
of
that
time
with
much
effect
the
arabs
had
made
noble
discoveries
in
science
averroès
had
among
many
divided
the
honors
with
thomas
aquinas
these
facts
gave
the
new
missile
it
was
the
epithet
mahometan
this
too
was
flung
with
effect
at
bacon
bacon
was
at
last
conquered
he
was
imprisoned
for
fourteen
years
at
the
age
of
eighty
years
he
was
released
from
prison
but
death
alone
took
him
beyond
the
reach
of
his
enemies
how
deeply
the
struggle
had
racked
his
mind
may
be
gathered
from
that
last
affecting
declaration
of
his
would
that
i
had
not
given
myself
so
much
trouble
for
the
love
of
science
sad
is
it
to
think
of
what
this
great
man
might
have
given
to
the
world
had
the
world
not
refused
the
gift
he
held
the
key
of
treasures
which
would
have
freed
mankind
from
ages
of
error
and
misery
with
his
discoveries
as
a
basis
with
his
method
as
a
guide
what
might
not
the
world
have
gained
nor
was
the
wrong
done
to
that
age
alone
it
was
done
to
this
age
also
the
nineteenth
century
was
robbed
at
the
same
time
with
the
thirteenth
but
for
that
interference
with
science
the
nineteenth
century
would
without
doubt
be
enjoying
discoveries
which
will

true
of

is
just
beginning
to

inkling
put
together
all
the
efforts
of
all
the
atheists
who
have
ever
lived
and
they
have
not
done
so
much
harm
to
christianity
and
the
world
as
has
been
done
by
the
conscientious
men
who
persecuted
roger
bacon
and
closed
the
path
which
he
gave
his
life
to
open
but
despite
the
persecution
of
bacon
and
the
defection
of
those
who
ought
to
have
followed
him
champions
of
natural
science
and
the
experimental
method
arose
from
time
to
time
during
the
succeeding
centuries
we
know
little
of
them
personally
our
main
knowledge
of
their
efforts
is
derived
from
the
efforts
of
their
opponents
and
persecutors
in
pope
john
xxii
issued
his
bull
nominally
leveled
at
the
alchemists
but
really
dealing
a
terrible
blow
at
the
beginnings
of
the
science
of
chemistry
in
charles
of
france
carried
out
the
same
policy
and
even
forbade
the
possession
of
furnaces
and
apparatus
necessary
for
chemical
processes
under
this
law
the
chemist
john
barillon
for
possessing
chemical
furnaces
and
apparatus
was
thrown
into
prison
and
it
was
only
by
the
greatest
effort
that
his
life
was
saved
in
henry
iv
of
england
issued
a
decree
of
the
same
sort
and
in
the
republic
of
venice
followed
the
example
of

somewhat
later
john
baptist
porta
began
his
investigations
despite
many
absurdities
his
work
was
most
fruitful
his
book
on
meteorology
was
the
first
in
which
sound
ideas
were
broached
his
researches
in
optics
gave
the
world
the
camera
obscura
and
possibly
the
telescope
in
chemistry
he
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
show
how
to
reduce
the
metallic
oxides
and
thus
to
have
laid
the
foundation
of
all
those
industries
based
upon
the
staining
and
coloring
of
glass
and
enamels
and
last
of
all
he
did
much
to
change
natural
philosophy
from
a
black
art
to
a
vigorous
open
science
he
encountered
the
same
old
policy
of
conscientious
men
the
society
founded
by
him
for
physical
research
i
secreti
was
broken
up
and
he
was
summoned
to
rome
and
censured
in
some
young
chemists
of
paris

taught
the
experimental
method
and

the

sitting

the
del
at
florence
under
the
presidency
of
prince
leopold
dei
medici
this
academy
promised
great
things
for
science
it
was
open
to
all
talent
its
only
fundamental
law
was
the
repudiation
of
any
favorite
system
or
sect
of
philosophy
and
the
obligation
to
investigate
nature
by
the
pure
light
of
experiment
the
new
academy
entered
into
scientific
investigations
with
energy
borelli
in
mathematics
redi
in
natural
history
and
many
others
pushed
on
the
boundaries
of
knowledge
heat
light
magnetism
electricity
projectiles
digestion
the
incompressibility
of
water
were
studied
by
the
right
method
and
with
results
that
enriched
the
world
the
academy
was
a
fortress
of
science
and
siege
was
soon
laid
to
it
the
votaries
of
scholastic
learning
denounced
it
as
irreligious
quarrels
were
fomented
leopold
was
bribed
with
a
cardinal
hat
and
drawn
away
to
rome
and
after
ten
years
of
beleaguering
the
fortress
fell
borelli
was
left
a
beggar
oliva
killed
himself
in
despair
still
later
just
before
the
great
discoveries
by
stahl
we
find
his
predecessor
becher
opposed
with
the
following
syllogism
king
solomon
according
to
the
scriptures
possessed
the
united
wisdom
of
heaven
and
earth
but
king
solomon
sent
his
vessels
to
ophir
to
seek
gold
and
he
levied
taxes
upon
his
subjects
now
if
solomon
had
known
anything
about
alchemy
he
would
not
have
done
this
therefore
solomon
did
not
know
anything
about
alchemy
or
chemistry
in
the
form
which
then
existed
therefore
alchemy
or
chemistry
has
no
reality
or
truth
and
we
find
that
becher
is
absolutely
turned
away
from
his
labors
and
obliged
to
devote
himself
to
proving
that
solomon
used
more
money
than
he
possibly
could
have
obtained
from
ophir
or
his
subjects
and
therefore
that
he
must
have
possessed
a
knowledge
of
chemical
methods
and
the
philosopher
stone
as
the
result
of
them
and
in
our
time
joseph
de
maistre
uttering
his
hatred
of
physical
sciences
declaring
that
man
has
paid
too
dearly
for
them
asserting
that
they
must
be
subjected
to
theology
likening
them
to
fire
good
when
confined
but
fearful
when
scattered
about
this
brilliant
thinker
has
been
the
centre
of
a
great
opposing
camp
an
army
of
good
men
who
can
not
relinquish
the
idea
that
the
bible
is
a
of
science
anatomy
and
medicine
i
pass
now
to
fields
of
more
immediate
importance
to
us
to
anatomy
and
medicine
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
votaries
of
sciences
like
these
would
be
suffered
to
escape
attack
unfortunately
they
have
had
to
stand
in
the
thickest
of
the
battle
the
church
even
in
its
earliest
centuries
seems
to
have
developed
a
distrust
of
them
tertullian
in
his
treatise
upon
the
soul
stigmatizes
the
surgeon
herophilus
as
a
butcher
and
evidently
on
account
of
his
skill
in
his
profession
rather
than
on
account
of
his
want
of
it
augustine
in
his
great
treatise
on
the
city
of
god
which
remains
to
this
day
one
of
the
treasures
of
the
church
speaks
with
some
bitterness
of
medical
men
who
are
called
anatomists
and
says
that
with
a
cruel
zeal
for
science
they
have
dissected
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
sometimes
of
sick
persons
who
have
died
under
their
knives
and
have
inhumanly
pried
into
the
secrets
of
the
human
body
to
learn
the
nature
of
disease
and
its
exact
seat
and
how
it
might
be
cured
but
it
was
not
until
the
mixture
of
theology
and
science
had
begun
to
ferment
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
ecclesiastical
power
had
been
aroused
in
behalf
of
this
sacred
mixture
that
the
feeling
against
medical
science
broke
into
open
war
about
the
beginning
of
that
century
pope
innocent
iii
forbade
surgical
operations
by
priests
deacons
or
subdeacons
pope
honorius
went
still
further
and
forbade
medicine
to
be
practised
by
archdeacons
priests
or
deacons
in
the
dominican
authorities
banished
books
on
medicine
from
their
monasteries
somewhat
later
pope
boniface
viii
interdicted
dissection
as
sacrilege
toward
the
close
of
that
great
religious
century
came
a
battle
which
serves
to
show
the
spirit
of
the
time
the
great
physician
and
chemist
of
the
day
was
arnold
de
villa
nova
although
he
has
been
overrated
by
some
modern
historians
as
a
votary
of
the
experimental
method
and
by
others
as
a
votary
of
alchemy
the
sober
judgment
of
the
most
thoughtful
has
acknowledged
him
as
one
of
the
most
useful
forerunners
of
modern
masters
in
medical
and
chemical
science
the
missile
usual
in
such
cases
was
hurled
at
him
he
was
charged
with
sorcery
and
dealings
with
the
devil
the
archbishop
of
tarragona
first
excommunicated
him
and
drove
him
from
spain
next
he
was
driven
from
paris
and
took
refuge
at
montpellier
thence
too
he
was
driven
finally
every
place
in
france
was
closed
against
him
and
he
became
an
outcast
such
seemed
the
fate
of
men
in
that
field
who
gained
even
a
glimmer
of
new
scientific
truth
even
men
like
cardan
and
paracelsus
and
porta
who
yielded
much
to
popular
superstitions
were
at
once
set
upon
if
they
ventured
upon
any
other
than
the
path
which
the
church
thought
sound
the
insufficient
path
of
aristotelian
investigation
we
have
seen
that
the
weapons
used
against
the
astronomers
were
mainly
the
epithets
infidel
and
atheist
we
have
also
seen
that
the
missiles
used
against
the
chemists
and
physicians
were
the
epithets
sorcerer
and
leaguer
with
the
devil
and
we
have
picked
up
on
various
another
effective
weapon
the
epithet
mohammedan
on
the
heads
of
the
anatomists
and
physicians
were
concentrated
these
missiles
the
charge
of
atheism
ripened
into
a
proverb
sunt
tres
medici
ibi
sunt
duo
magic
seemed
so
common
a
charge
that
many
of
the
physicians
seemed
to
believe
it
themselves
mohammedanism
and
averroism
became
almost
synonymous
with
medicine
and
petrarch
stigmatized
averroists
as
men
who
deny
genesis
and
bark
at
christ
not
to
weary
you
with
the
details
of
earlier
struggles
i
will
select
a
great
benefactor
of
mankind
and
champion
of
scientific
truth
at
the
period
of
the
revival
of
learning
and
the
reformation
andreas
vesalius
the
founder
of
the
modern
science
of
anatomy
the
battle
waged
by
this
man
is
one
of
the
glories
of
our
race
the
old
methods
were
soon
exhausted
by
his
early
fervor
and
he
sought
to
advance
science
by
truly
scientific
means
by
patient
investigation
and
by
careful
recording
of
results
from
the
outset
vesalius
proved
himself
a
master
in
the
search
for
real
knowledge
he
braved
the
most
terrible
dangers
before
his
time
the
dissection
of
the
human
subject
was
thought
akin
to
sacrilege
occasionally
an
anatomist
like
mundinus
had
given
some
little
display
with
such
a
subject
but
for
the
purposes
of
such
dissection
was
forbidden
as
we
have
already
seen
even
such
men
in
the
early
church
as
tertullian
and
augustine
held
anatomy
in
abhorrence
and
boniface
viii
interdicted
dissection
as
sacrilege
through
this
sacred
conventionalism
vesalius
broke
without
fear
braving
ecclesiastical
censure
and
popular
fury
he
studied
his
science
by
the
only
method
that
could
give
useful
results
no
peril
daunted
him
to
secure
the
material
for
his
investigations
he
haunted
gibbets
and
in
this
search
he
risked
alike
the
fires
of
the
inquisition
and
the
virus
of
the
plague
first
of
all
men
he
began
to
place
the
science
of
human
anatomy
on
its
solid
modern
foundations
on
careful
examination
and
observation
of
the
human
body
this
was
his
first
great
sin
and
it
was
soon
aggravated
by
one
considered
even
greater
perhaps
the
most
unfortunate
thing
that
has
ever
been
done
for
christianity
is
the
tying
it
to
forms
of
science
which
are
doomed
and
gradually
sinking
just
as
in
the
time
of
roger
bacon
excellent
but
mistaken
men
devoted
all
their
energies
to
binding
christianity
to
aristotle
just
as
in
the
time
of
reuchlin
and
erasmus
they
insisted
on
binding
christianity
to
thomas
aquinas
so
in
the
time
of
vesalius
such
men
made
every
effort
to
link
christianity
to
galen
the
cry
has
been
the
same
in
all
ages
it
is
the
same
which
we
hear
in
this
age
for
curbing
scientific
studies
the
cry
for
what
is
called
sound
learning
whether
standing
for
aristotle
against
bacon
or
aquinas
against
erasmus
or
galen
against
vesalius
or
making
mechanical
greek
verses
at
eton
instead
of
studying
the
handiwork
of
the
almighty
or
reading
euripides
with
translations
instead
of
lessing
and
goethe
in
the
original
the
cry
always
is
for
sound
learning
the
idea
always
is
that
these
studies
are
at
years
of
age
vesalius
gave
to
the
world
his
great
work
on
human
anatomy
with
it
ended
the
old
and
began
the
new
its
researches
by
their
thoroughness
were
a
triumph
of
science
its
illustrations
by
their
fidelity
were
a
triumph
of
art
to
shield
himself
as
far
as
possible
in
the
battle
which
he
foresaw
must
come
vesalius
prefaced
the
work
by
a
dedication
to
the
emperor
charles
in
this
dedicatory
preface
he
argues
for
his
method
and
against
the
parrot
repetitions
of
the
mediæval
he
also
condemns
the
wretched
anatomical
preparations
and
specimens
made
by
physicians
who
utterly
refused
to
advance
beyond
the
ancient
master
the
repeaters
of
galen
gave
battle
at
once
after
the
manner
of
their
time
their
first
missiles
were
epithets
and
the
almost
infinite
magazine
of
these
having
been
exhausted
they
began
to
use
sharper
weapons
weapons
theologic
at
first
the
theologic
weapons
failed
a
conference
of
divines
having
been
asked
to
decide
whether
dissection
of
the
human
body
is
sacrilege
gave
a
decision
in
the
negative
the
reason
is
simple
charles
had
made
vesalius
his
physician
and
could
not
spare
him
but
on
the
accession
of
philip
ii
of
spain
the
whole
scene
changed
that
most
bitter
of
bigots
must
of
course
detest
the
great
innovator
a
new
weapon
was
now
forged
vesalius
was
charged
with
dissecting
living
men
and
either
from
direct
persecution
as
the
great
majority
of
authors
assert
or
from
indirect
influences
as
the
recent
apologists
for
philip
ii
allow
vesalius
became
a
wanderer
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
to
atone
for
his
sin
he
was
shipwrecked
and
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
strength
he
was
lost
to
this
world
and
yet
not
lost
in
this
century
he
again
stands
on
earth
the
painter
hamann
has
again
given
him
to
us
by
the
magic
of
hamann
pencil
we
look
once
more
into
vesalius
cell
its
windows
and
doors
bolted
and
barred
within
betoken
the
storm
of
bigotry
which
rages
without
the
crucifix
toward
which
he
turns
his
eyes
symbolizes
the
spirit
in
which
he
labors
the
corpse
of
the
over
which
he
bends
ceases
to
be
repulsive
his
very
soul
seems
to
send
forth
rays
from
the
canvas
which
strengthen
us
for
the
good
fight
in
this
age
he
was
hunted
to
death
by
men
who
conscientiously
supposed
he
was
injuring
religion
his
poor
blind
foes
destroyed
one
of
greatest
apostles
what
was
his
influence
on
religion
he
substituted
for
repetition
by
rote
of
theories
of
dead
men
conscientious
and
reverent
searching
into
the
works
of
the
living
god
he
substituted
for
representations
of
the
human
structure
pitiful
and
unreal
truthful
representations
revealing
the
creator
power
and
goodness
in
every
line
i
hasten
now
to
the
most
singular
struggle
and
victory
of
medical
science
between
the
sixteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
early
in
the
last
century
boyer
presented
inoculation
as
a
preventive
of
in
france
thoughtful
physicians
in
england
led
by
lady
montagu
and
maitland
followed
his
example
theology
took
fright
at
once
on
both
sides
of
the
channel
the
french
theologians
of
the
sorbonne
solemnly
condemned
the
practice
english
theologians
were
most
loudly
represented
by
the
rev
edward
massy
who
in
preached
a
sermon
in
which
he
declared
that
job
distemper
was
probably
confluent
and
that
he
had
been
doubtless
inoculated
by
the
devil
that
diseases
are
sent
by
providence
for
the
punishment
of
sin
and
that
the
proposed
attempt
to
prevent
them
is
a
diabolical
operation
this
sermon
was
entitled
the
dangerous
and
sinful
practice
of
inoculation
not
less
absurd
was
the
sermon
of
the
rev
delafaye
entitled
inoculation
an
indefensible
practice
thirty
years
later
the
struggle
was
still
going
on
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
one
great
churchman
maddox
bishop
of
worcester
giving
battle
on
the
side
of
right
reason
but
as
late
as
we
have
the
rector
of
canterbury
denouncing
inoculation
from
his
pulpit
in
the
primatial
city
and
many
of
his
brethren
following
his
example
among
the
most
common
weapons
hurled
by
churchmen
at
the
supporters
of
inoculation
during
all
this
long
war
were
charges
of
sorcery
and
atheism
nor
did
jenner
blessed
discovery
of
vaccination
escape
opposition
on
similar
grounds
in
an
society
was
formed
by
clergymen
and
physicians
calling
on
the
people
of
england
to
suppress
vaccination
as
bidding
defiance
to
heaven
itself
even
to
the
will
of
god
and
declaring
that
the
law
of
god
prohibits
the
practice
in
the
rev
ramsden
thundered
against
it
in
a
sermon
before
the
university
of
cambridge
mingling
texts
of
scripture
with
calumnies
against
jenner
but
plumptre
in
england
waterhouse
in
america
and
a
host
of
other
good
men
and
true
press
forward
to
jenner
side
and
at
last
science
humanity
and
right
reason
gain
the
victory
but
i
pass
to
one
typical
conflict
in
our
days
in
james
young
simpson
a
scotch
physician
of
eminence
advocated
the
use
of
anæsthetics
in
obstetrical
cases
immediately
a
storm
arose
from
pulpit
after
pulpit
such
a
use
of
chloroform
was
denounced
as
impious
it
was
declared
contrary
to
holy
writ
and
texts
were
cited
abundantly
the
ordinary
declaration
was
that
to
use
chloroform
was
to
avoid
one
part
of
the
primeval
curse
on
woman
simpson
wrote
pamphlet
after
pamphlet
to
defend
the
blessing
which
he
brought
into
use
but
the
battle
seemed
about
to
be
lost
when
he
seized
a
new
weapon
my
opponents
forget
said
he
the
verse
of
the
second
chapter
of
genesis
that
is
the
record
of
the
first
surgical
operation
ever
performed
and
that
text
proves
that
the
maker
of
the
universe
before
he
took
the
rib
from
adam
side
for
the
creation
of
eve
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
fall
on
adam
this
was
a
stunning
blow
but
it
did
not
entirely
kill
the
opposition
they
had
strength
left
to
maintain
that
the
deep
sleep
of
adam
took
place
before
the
introduction
of
pain
into
the
world
in
the
state
of
innocence
but
now
a
new
champion
intervened
thomas
chalmers
with
a
few
pungent
arguments
he
scattered
the
enemy
forever
and
the
greatest
battle
of
science
against
suffering
was
won
but
was
not
the
victory
won
also
for
religion
go
to
yonder
monument
in
boston
to
one
of
the
discoverers
of
anæsthesia
read
this
inscription
from
our
sacred
volume
this
also
cometh
from
the
lord
of
hosts
which
is
wonderful
in
counsel
and
excellent
in
working
geology
i
now
ask
you
to
look
at
another
part
of
the
great
warfare
and
i
select
it
because
it
shows
more
clearly
than
any
other
how
protestant
nations
and
in
our
own
time
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
led
into
the
same
errors
that
have
wrought
injury
to
religion
and
science
in
other
times
we
will
look
very
briefly
at
the
of
geology
from
the
first
lispings
of
this
science
there
was
war
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
the
church
was
that
in
the
beginning
god
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
that
all
things
were
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
that
to
say
that
stones
and
fossils
have
been
made
since
the
beginning
is
contrary
to
scripture
the
theological
substitutes
for
scientific
explanations
ripened
into
such
as
these
that
the
fossils
are
sports
of
nature
or
creations
of
plastic
force
or
results
of
a
seminal
air
acting
upon
rocks
or
models
made
by
the
creator
before
he
had
fully
decided
upon
the
best
manner
of
creating
various
beings
but
while
some
latitude
was
allowed
among
these
explanations
it
was
held
essential
to
believe
that
they
were
placed
in
all
the
strata
on
one
of
the
by
the
hand
of
the
almighty
and
that
this
was
done
for
some
mysterious
purpose
of
his
own
probably
for
the
trial
of
human
faith
in
the
sixteenth
century
fracastoro
and
palissy
broached
the
true
idea
but
produced
little
effect
near
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
de
clave
bitaud
and
de
villon
revived
it
the
theologic
faculty
of
paris
protested
against
the
doctrine
as
unscriptural
destroyed
the
offending
treatises
banished
the
authors
from
paris
and
forbade
them
to
live
in
towns
or
enter
places
of
public
resort
at
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
buffon
made
another
attempt
to
state
simple
and
fundamental
geological
truths
the
theological
faculty
of
the
sorbonne
immediately
dragged
him
from
his
high
position
forced
him
to
recant
ignominiously
and
to
print
his
recantation
it
required
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
for
science
to
carry
the
day
fairly
against
this
single
preposterous
theory
the
champion
who
dealt
it
the
deadly
blow
was
scilla
and
his
weapons
were
facts
revealed
by
the
fossils
of
calabria
but
the
advocates
of
tampering
with
scientific
reasoning
now
retired
to
a
new
position
it
was
strong
for
it
was
apparently
based
on
scripture
though
as
the
whole
world
now
knows
an
utterly
false
interpretation
of
scripture
the
new
position
was
that
the
fossils
were
produced
by
the
deluge
of
noah
in
vain
had
it
been
shown
by
such
devoted
christians
as
bernard
palissy
that
this
theory
was
utterly
untenable
in
vain
did
good
men
protest
against
the
injury
sure
to
result
to
religion
by
tying
it
to
a
scientific
theory
sure
to
be
exploded
the
doctrine
that
fossils
were
the
remains
of
animals
drowned
at
the
flood
continued
to
be
upheld
by
the
great
majority
as
sound
doctrine
and
as
a
blessed
means
of
reconciling
science
with
scripture
to
sustain
this
scriptural
view
so
called
efforts
were
put
forth
absolutely
herculean
both
by
catholics
and
protestants
mazurier
declared
certain
fossil
remains
of
a
mammoth
discovered
in
france
to
be
bones
of
giants
mentioned
in
scripture
father
torrubia
did
the
same
thing
in
spain
increase
mather
sent
similar
remains
discovered
in
america
to
england
with
a
similar
statement
scheuchzer
made
parade
of
the
bones
of
a
great
lizard
discovered
in
germany
as
the
diluvii
the
fossil
man
proving
the
reality
of
the
deluge
in
the
midst
of
this
appears
an
episode
very
comical
but
very
instructive
for
it
shows
that
the
attempt
to
shape
the
deductions
of
science
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
theology
may
mislead
heterodoxy
as
absurdly
as
orthodoxy
about
the
year
news
of
the
discovery
of
marine
fossils
in
various
elevated
districts
of
europe
reached
voltaire
he
too
had
a
theologic
system
to
support
though
his
system
was
opposed
to
that
of
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
he
feared
that
these
new
discoveries
might
be
used
to
support
the
mosaic
accounts
of
the
deluge
all
his
wisdom
and
wit
therefore
were
compacted
into
arguments
to
prove
that
the
fossil
fishes
were
remains
of
fishes
intended
for
food
but
spoiled
and
thrown
away
by
travelers
that
the
fossil
shells
were
accidentally
dropped
by
crusaders
and
pilgrims
returning
from
the
holy
land
and
that
sundry
fossil
bones
found
between
paris
and
étampes
were
parts
of
a
skeleton
belonging
to
the
cabinet
of
some
ancient
philosopher
through
chapter
after
chapter
voltaire
obeying
the
supposed
necessities
of
his
theology
fights
desperately
the
growing
results
of
the
geologic
investigations
of
his
time
but
far
more
widespread
and
disastrous
was
the
effort
on
the
other
side
to
show
that
the
fossils
were
caused
by
the
deluge
of
noah
no
supposition
was
too
violent
to
support
a
theory
which
was
considered
vital
to
the
bible
sometimes
it
was
claimed
that
the
tail
of
a
comet
had
produced
the
deluge
sometimes
by
a
prosaic
rendering
of
the
expression
regarding
the
breaking
up
of
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
a
theory
was
started
that
the
earth
contained
a
great
cistern
from
which
the
waters
came
and
to
which
they
retired
by
taking
sacred
poetry
as
prose
and
by
giving
a
literal
interpretation
of
it
thomas
burnet
in
his
sacred
theory
of
the
earth
whiston
in
his
theory
of
the
deluge
and
others
like
them
built
up
systems
which
bear
to
real
geology
much
the
same
relation
that
the
christian
topography
of
cosmas
bears
to
real
geography
in
vain
were
exhibited
the
absolute
geological
zoölogical
astronomical
proofs
that
no
universal
deluge
or
deluge
covering
any
great
extent
of
the
earth
had
taken
place
within
the
last
six
thousand
or
sixty
thousand
years
in
vain
did
bishop
clayton
declare
that
the
deluge
could
not
have
taken
place
save
in
that
district
where
noah
lived
before
the
flood
in
vain
was
it
shown
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
universal
deluge
the
fossils
were
not
produced
by
it
the
only
answers
were
the
citation
of
the
text
and
all
the
high
mountains
which
were
under
the
whole
heaven
were
covered
and
denunciations
of
infidelity
in
england
france
and
germany
belief
that
the
fossils
were
produced
by
the
deluge
of
noah
was
insisted
upon
as
part
of
that
faith
essential
to
salvation
it
took
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
for
the
searchers
of
god
truth
as
revealed
in
nature
such
men
as
buffon
linnæus
whitehurst
and
daubenton
to
push
their
works
under
these
mighty
fabrics
of
error
and
by
statements
which
could
not
be
resisted
to
explode
them
strange
as
it
may
at
first
seem
the
war
on
geology
was
waged
more
fiercely
in
protestant
countries
than
in
catholic
the
older
church
had
learned
by
her
earlier
wretched
mistakes
what
dangers
to
her
claim
of
infallibility
lay
in
meddling
with
a
growing
science
in
italy
then
entirely
under
papal
control
little
open
opposition
was
made
and
of
all
countries
england
furnished
the
most
bitter
opponents
to
geology
at
first
and
the
most
active
negotiators
in
patching
up
a
truce
on
a
basis
of
sham
science
afterward
you
have
noted
already
that
there
are
generally
two
sorts
of
attack
on
a
new
science
first
there
is
the
attack
by
pitting
against
science
some
great
doctrine
in
theology
you
saw
this
in
astronomy
when
bellarmin
and
others
insisted
that
the
doctrine
of
the
earth
revolving
about
the
sun
is
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
so
now
against
geology
it
was
urged
that
the
scientific
doctrine
that
the
fossils
represented
animals
which
died
before
adam
was
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
adam
fall
and
that
death
entered
the
world
by
sin
then
there
is
the
attack
by
literal
interpretation
of
texts
based
upon
the
idea
that
the
bible
is
a
compendium
of
history
or
a
of
natural
science
which
serves
a
better
purpose
generally
in
rousing
prejudices
toward
the
close
of
the
last
century
in
england
the
opponents
of
geology
on
biblical
grounds
seemed
likely
to
sweep
all
before
them
cramping
our
sacred
volume
within
the
rules
of
an
historical
compend
they
showed
the
terrible
dangers
arising
from
the
revelations
of
geology
which
make
the
earth
older
than
the
six
thousand
years
required
by
archbishop
usher
interpretation
of
the
old
testament
nor
was
this
panic
confined
to
ecclesiastics
williams
a
thoughtful
layman
declared
that
such
researches
led
to
infidelity
and
atheism
and
are
nothing
less
than
to
depose
the
almighty
creator
of
the
universe
from
his
office
the
poet
cowper
one
of
the
mildest
of
men
was
also
roused
by
these
dangers
and
in
his
most
elaborate
poem
wrote
some
drill
and
bore
the
solid
earth
and
from
the
strata
there
extract
a
register
by
which
we
learn
that
he
who
made
it
and
revealed
its
date
to
moses
was
mistaken
in
its
age
and
difficult
as
it
is
to
realize
it
now
within
the
memory
of
many
of
us
the
battle
was
still
raging
most
fiercely
in
england
and
both
kinds
of
artillery
usually
brought
against
a
new
science
were
in
full
play
and
filling
the
civilized
world
with
their
roar
about
thirty
years
ago
the
rev
mellor
brown
the
rev
henry
cole
and
others
were
hurling
at
all
geologists
alike
and
especially
at
such
christian
divines
as
buckland
and
dean
conybeare
and
pye
smith
and
such
religious
scholars
as
sedgwick
the
epithets
of
infidel
impugner
of
the
sacred
record
and
assailant
of
the
volume
of
god
their
favorite
weapon
was
the
charge
that
these
men
were
attacking
the
truth
of
god
forgetting
that
they
were
simply
opposing
the
mistaken
interpretations
of
brown
cole
and
others
like
them
inadequately
informed
they
declared
geology
not
a
subject
of
lawful
inquiry
denouncing
it
as
a
dark
art
as
dangerous
and
disreputable
as
a
forbidden
province
as
infernal
artillery
and
as
an
awful
evasion
of
the
testimony
of
revelation
this
attempt
to
scare
men
from
the
science
having
failed
various
other
means
were
taken
to
say
nothing
about
england
it
is
humiliating
to
human
nature
to
remember
the
annoyances
and
even
trials
to
which
the
pettiest
and
narrowest
of
men
subjected
such
christian
scholars
in
our
own
country
as
benjamin
silliman
and
edward
hitchcock
and
louis
agassiz
but
it
is
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
to
state
here
that
one
great
christian
scholar
did
honor
to
religion
and
to
himself
by
standing
up
for
the
claims
of
science
despite
all
these
clamors
that
man
was
nicholas
wiseman
better
known
afterward
as
cardinal
wiseman
the
conduct
of
this
pillar
of
the
roman
catholic
church
contrasts
nobly
with
that
of
timid
protestants
who
were
filling
england
with
shrieks
and
denunciations
and
here
let
me
note
that
one
of
the
prettiest
skirmishes
in
this
war
was
made
in
new
england
stuart
of
andover
justly
honored
as
a
hebrew
scholar
virtually
declared
that
geology
was
becoming
dangerous
that
to
speak
of
six
periods
of
time
for
the
creation
was
flying
in
the
face
of
scripture
that
genesis
expressly
speaks
of
six
days
each
made
up
of
an
evening
and
a
morning
and
not
six
periods
of
time
to
him
replied
a
professor
in
yale
college
james
kingsley
in
an
article
admirable
for
keen
wit
and
kindly
temper
he
showed
that
genesis
speaks
just
as
clearly
of
a
solid
firmament
as
of
six
ordinary
days
and
that
if
stuart
had
got
over
one
difficulty
and
accepted
the
copernican
theory
he
might
as
well
get
over
another
and
accept
the
revelations
of
geology
the
encounter
was
quick
and
decisive
and
the
victory
was
with
science
and
our
own
honored
yale
but
perhaps
the
most
singular
attempt
against
geology
was
made
by
a
fine
specimen
of
the
english
don
dean
cockburn
of
york
to
its
champions
out
of
the
field
without
apparently
the
simplest
elementary
knowledge
of
geology
he
opened
a
battery
of
abuse
he
gave
it
to
the
world
at
large
by
pulpit
and
press
he
even
inflicted
it
upon
leading
statesmen
by
private
letters
from
his
pulpit
in
york
minster
mary
somerville
was
denounced
coarsely
by
name
for
those
studies
in
physical
geography
which
have
made
her
honored
throughout
the
world
but
these
weapons
did
not
succeed
they
were
like
chinese
gongs
and
against
rifled
cannon
buckland
pye
smith
lyell
silliman
hitchcock
murchison
agassiz
dana
and
a
host
of
noble
champions
besides
press
on
and
the
battle
for
truth
is
won
and
was
it
won
merely
for
men
of
science
the
whole
civilized
world
declares
that
it
was
won
for
religion
that
thereby
was
infinitely
increased
the
knowledge
of
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
political
economy
from
the
many
questions
on
which
the
supporters
of
right
reason
in
political
and
social
science
have
only
conquered
conscientious
opposition
after
centuries
of
war
i
select
the
taking
of
interest
on
loans
in
hardly
any
struggle
has
rigid
adherence
to
the
bible
as
a
scientific
been
more
prolonged
or
injurious
certainly
if
the
criterion
of
truth
as
regards
any
doctrine
be
that
it
has
been
believed
in
the
church
always
everywhere
and
by
all
then
on
no
point
may
a
christian
of
these
days
be
more
sure
than
that
every
every
loan
and
trust
company
every
bank
every
loan
of
capital
by
an
individual
every
means
by
which
accumulated
capital
has
been
lawfully
lent
even
at
the
most
moderate
interest
to
make
the
masses
of
men
workers
rather
than
paupers
is
based
on
deadly
sin
the
fathers
of
the
christian
church
received
from
the
ancient
world
a
strong
prejudice
against
any
taking
of
interest
whatever
in
greece
aristotle
had
condemned
it
in
rome
it
was
regarded
during
many
generations
as
a
crime
but
far
greater
in
the
early
church
was
the
influence
of
certain
texts
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
citations
from
leviticus
deuteronomy
the
psalms
ezekiel
and
luke
were
universally
held
to
condemn
all
loans
at
interest
on
these
texts
the
doctrine
and
legislation
of
the
universal
church
as
regards
interest
for
money
were
based
and
developed
the
fathers
of
the
eastern
church
and
among
them
st
basil
chrysostom
and
gregory
nazianzen
the
fathers
of
the
western
church
and
among
them
tertullian
ambrose
augustine
and
jerome
joined
most
earnestly
in
this
condemnation
chrysostom
says
what
can
be
more
unreasonable
than
to
sow
without
land
without
rain
without
ploughs
all
those
who
give
themselves
up
to
this
damnable
agriculture
shall
reap
only

let
us
cut
off
these
monstrous
births
of
gold
and
silver
let
us
stop
this
execrable
fecundity
jerome
threw
the
argument
into
the
form
of
a
dilemma
which
was
used
as
a
weapon
against
for
centuries
this
entire
agreement
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
led
to
the
crystallization
of
the
hostility
to
loans
into
numberless
decrees
of
popes
and
councils
and
kings
and
legislatures
throughout
christendom
during
more
than
fifteen
hundred
years
and
the
canon
law
was
shaped
in
accordance
with
these
in
the
ninth
century
alfred
in
england
confiscated
the
estates
of
and
denied
them
burial
in
consecrated
ground
and
similar
decrees
were
made
in
other
parts
of
europe
in
the
twelfth
century
the
greek
church
seems
to
have
relaxed
its
strictness
somewhat
but
the
roman
church
only
grew
more
and
more
severe
bernard
reviving
religious
earnestness
in
the
church
was
especially
strenuous
in
denouncing
loans
at
interest
and
in
the
third
council
of
the
lateran
decreed
that
every
impenitent
should
be
excluded
from
the
altar
from
absolution
in
the
hour
of
death
and
from
christian
burial
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
mistaken
idea
was
still
more
firmly
knit
into
the
thought
of
the
church
by
thomas
aquinas
hostility
to
loans
at
interest
had
been
poured
into
his
mind
not
only
from
the
scriptures
but
from
aristotle
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
council
of
vienne
presided
over
by
pope
clement
declared
that
if
any
one
shall
pertinaciously
presume
to
affirm
that
the
taking
of
interest
for
money
is
not
a
sin
we
decree
him
to
be
a
heretic
fit
for
punishment
the
economical
and
social
results
of
this
conscientious
policy
were
exceedingly
unfortunate
money
could
only
be
loaned
in
most
countries
at
the
risk
of
incurring
odium
in
this
world
and
damnation
in
the
next
hence
there
was
but
little
capital
and
few
lenders
hence
came
enormous
rates
of
interest
thereby
were
commerce
manufactures
and
general
enterprise
dwarfed
while
pauperism
flourished
but
even
worse
than
this
were
the
moral
results
for
nations
to
do
what
they
believe
is
evil
is
only
second
in
bad
consequences
to
their
doing
what
is
really
evil
all
lending
and
borrowing
even
for
the
most
legitimate
purposes
and
at
the
most
reasonable
rates
tended
to
debase
the
character
of
both
borrower
and
lender
and
these
moral
evils
took
more
definite
shapes
than
might
at
first
be
thought
possible
sismondi
one
of
the
most
thoughtful
of
modern
political
philosophers
and
historians
declares
that
the
prohibition
of
interest
for
the
use
of
money
in
continental
europe
did
very
much
to
promote
a
passion
for
luxury
and
to
discourage
economy
the
rich
who
were
not
engaged
in
business
finding
no
easy
way
of
employing
their
savings
productively
these
evils
became
so
manifest
when
trade
began
to
revive
throughout
europe
in
the
fifteenth
century
that
most
earnest
efforts
were
made
to
induce
the
church
to
change
its
position
the
first
important
effort
of
this
kind
was
made
by
john
gerson
his
general
learning
had
made
him
chancellor
of
the
university
of
paris
his
sacred
learning
made
him
the
leading
theologian
and
orator
at
the
council
of
constance
his
piety
led
men
to
attribute
to
him
the
imitation
of
christ
shaking
off
theological
shackles
he
declared
better
is
it
to
lend
money
at
reasonable
interest
and
thus
to
give
aid
to
the
poor
than
to
see
them
reduced
by
poverty
to
steal
waste
their
goods
and
sell
at
a
low
price
their
personal
and
real
property
but
this
idea
was
at
once
suppressed
by
the
church
buried
beneath
citations
from
scripture
the
fathers
councils
popes
and
the
canon
law
even
in
the
most
active
countries
there
seemed
no
hope
in
england
under
henry
cardinal
morton
the
addressed
parliament
asking
them
to
take
into
consideration
loans
of
money
at
interest
and
the
result
was
a
law
which
imposed
on
lenders
at
interest
a
fine
of
a
hundred
pounds
besides
the
annulment
of
the
loan
and
to
show
that
there
was
an
offence
against
religion
involved
there
was
added
a
clause
reserving
to
the
church
notwithstanding
this
punishment
the
correction
of
their
souls
according
to
the
laws
of
the
same
similar
enactments
were
made
by
civil
authority
in
various
parts
of
europe
and
as
a
climax
just
as
the
trade
and
commerce
and
manufactures
of
the
modern
epoch
had
received
an
immense
impulse
from
the
great
series
of
voyages
of
discovery
by
such
as
columbus
vasco
de
gama
magellan
and
the
cabots
this
barrier
against
enterprise
was
strengthened
by
a
decree
from
pope
leo
x
but
this
mistaken
policy
was
not
confined
to
the
older
church
the
reformed
church
was
led
by
luther
and
several
of
his
associates
into
the
same
line
of
thought
and
practice
said
luther
to
exchange
anything
with
any
one
and
gain
by
the
exchange
is
not
to
do
a
charity
but
to
steal
every
usurer
is
a
thief
worthy
of
the
gibbet
i
call
those
usurers
who
lend
money
at
five
or
six
per
cent
the
english
reformers
showed
the
same
tendency
under
henry
the
law
of
henry
vii
against
taking
interest
had
been
modified
but
the
revival
of
religious
feeling
under
edward
vi
caused
in
the
passage
of
the
bill
of
usury
in
this
it
is
said
forasmuch
as
usury
is
by
the
word
of
god
utterly
prohibited
as
a
vice
most
odious
and
detestable
as
in
divers
places
of
the
holy
scriptures
it
is
evident
to
be
seen
which
thing
by
no
godly
teachings
and
persuasions
can
sink
into
the
hearts
of
divers
greedy
uncharitable
and
covetous
persons
of
this
realm
nor
yet
by
any
terrible
threatenings
of
god
wrath
and
vengeance
it
is
enacted
that
whosoever
shall
thereafter
lend
money
for
any
manner
of
usury
increase
lucre
gain
or
interest
to
be
had
received
or
hoped
for
shall
forfeit
principal
and
interest
and
suffer
imprisonment
and
fine
at
the
pleasure
but
most
fortunately
it
happened
that
calvin
turned
in
the
right
direction
and
there
was
developed
among
protestants
the
serviceable
fiction
that
usury
means
or
interest
under
cover
of
this
fiction
commerce
and
trade
revived
rapidly
in
protestant
countries
though
with
occasional
checks
from
exact
interpreters
of
scripture
but
in
the
older
church
the
more
correct
though
less
fortunate
interpretation
of
the
sacred
texts
relating
to
interest
continued
when
it
was
attempted
in
france
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
argue
that
usury
means
oppressive
interest
the
theological
faculty
of
the
sorbonne
declared
that
usury
is
the
taking
of
any
interest
at
all
no
matter
how
little
and
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
ezekiel
was
cited
to
clinch
this
judgment
another
attempt
to
ease
the
burden
on
industry
and
commerce
was
made
by
declaring
that
usury
means
interest
demanded
not
as
matter
of
favor
but
as
matter
of
right
this
too
was
solemnly
condemned
by
pope
innocent
xi
again
the
army
of
right
reason
pressed
forward
declaring
that
usury
is
interest
greater
than
the
law
allows
this
too
was
condemned
and
the
declaration
that
usury
is
interest
on
loans
not
for
a
fixed
time
was
condemned
by
pope
alexander
vii
still
the
attacking
forces
pressed
on
and
among
them
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
france
was
richard
simon
he
attempts
to
gloss
over
the
strict
interpretation
of
scripture
in
this
matter
by
an
elaborate
treatise
he
is
immediately
confronted
by
bossuet
it
seems
hardly
possible
that
one
of
the
greatest
intellects
of
a
period
so
near
us
could
have
been
so
doubly
deceived
yet
bossuet
the
glory
of
the
french
church
one
of
the
keenest
and
strongest
of
thinkers
not
only
mingled
scripture
with
astronomy
and
opposed
the
copernican
theory
but
also
mingled
scripture
with
political
economy
and
denounced
the
lending
of
money
at
interest
he
declared
that
the
scriptures
the
councils
of
the
church
from
the
beginning
the
popes
the
fathers
all
interpreted
the
prohibition
of
usury
to
be
a
prohibition
of
any
lending
at
interest
and
bossuet
demonstrated
this
interpretation
as
the
true
one
simon
was
put
to
confusion
and
his
book
condemned
there
was
but
too
much
reason
for
bossuet
interpretation
the
prohibition
of
this
one
of
the
most
simple
and
beneficial
principles
in
political
and
economical
science
was
affirmed
not
only
by
the
fathers
but
by
councils
of
the
church
six
of
them
general
councils
and
by
seventeen
popes
to
say
nothing
of
innumerable
doctors
in
theology
and
canon
law
but
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
evil
could
be
endured
no
longer
a
way
of
escape
be
found
the
army
opposed
to
the
church
had
become
so
formidable
that
the
roman
authorities
saw
that
a
concession
must
be
made
in
appeared
of
the
in
it
were
concentrated
twenty
years
study
and
thought
of
a
great
thinker
on
the
necessities
of
the
world
about
him
in
eighteen
months
it
went
through
editions
and
it
was
translated
into
every
civilized
language
this
work
attacked
among
other
abuses
the
position
of
the
church
regarding
interest
for
money
the
church
authorities
had
already
taken
the
alarm
benedict
xiv
saw
that
the
best
thing
for
him
nay
the
only
thing
was
a
surrender
under
form
of
a
compromise
in
a
brief
he
declared
substantially
that
the
law
of
the
church
was
opposed
to
the
taking
of
interest
on
loans
and
then
after
sundry
and
ambiguous
statements
he
hinted
that
there
were
possible
exceptions
to
the
rule
like
the
casuistry
of
boscovich
in
using
the
copernican
theory
for
convenience
in
argument
while
acquiescing
in
its
condemnation
by
the
church
this
casuistry
of
benedict
broke
the
spell
turgot
adam
smith
bentham
and
their
disciples
pressed
on
and
science
won
for
mankind
another
great
victory
yet
in
this
case
as
in
others
insurrections
against
the
sway
of
scientific
truth
appeared
among
some
religionists
when
the
sorbonne
having
retreated
from
its
old
position
armed
itself
with
sundry
new
casuistries
against
those
who
held
to
its
earlier
decisions
provincial
doctors
in
theology
protested
indignantly
making
the
old
citations
from
the
scriptures
fathers
saints
doctors
popes
councils
and
canonists
and
even
as
late
as
when
the
roman
court
though
declining
to
commit
itself
on
the
doctrine
involved
decreed
that
confessors
should
no
longer
disquiet
lenders
of
money
at
legal
interest
the
old
weapons
were
again
furbished
and
hurled
by
the
abbé
laborde
vicar
of
the
metropolitan
archdiocese
of
auch
and
by
the
abbé
dennavit
professor
of
theology
at
lyons
good
abbé
dennavit
declared
that
he
refused
absolution
to
those
who
took
interest
and
to
priests
who
pretend
that
the
sanction
of
the
civil
law
is
sufficient
but
the
peace
on
this
question
is
too
profound
to
be
disturbed
by
such
outcries
the
torlonia
family
at
rome
with
its
palaces
chapels
intermarriages
affiliations
and
papal
favor
all
won
by
lending
money
at
interest
and
by
devotion
to
the
roman
see
is
a
growth
on
ramparts
long
since
surrendered
and
deserted
industrial
sciences
did
time
permit
we
might
go
over
other
no
less
instructive
than
those
we
have
seen
we
might
go
over
the
of
agricultural
progress
and
note
how
by
a
most
curious
perversion
of
a
text
of
scripture
many
of
the
peasantry
of
russia
were
prevented
from
raising
and
eating
potatoes
and
how
in
scotland
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
use
of
for
winnowing
grain
was
denounced
as
contrary
to
the
text
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
as
leaguing
with
satan
who
is
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
and
as
sufficient
cause
for
excommunication
from
the
scotch
church
we
might
go
over
the
of
civil
engineering
and
note
how
the
introduction
of
railways
into
france
was
declared
by
an
archbishop
to
be
an
evidence
of
the
divine
displeasure
against
country
innkeepers
who
set
meat
before
their
guests
on
and
now
were
punished
by
seeing
travelers
carried
by
their
doors
and
how
railroad
and
telegraph
were
denounced
from
noted
pulpits
as
heralds
of
and
then
we
might
pass
to
protestant
england
and
recall
the
sermon
of
the
curate
of
rotherhithe
at
the
breaking
in
of
the
thames
tunnel
so
destructive
to
life
and
property
declaring
that
it
was
but
a
just
judgment
upon
the
presumptuous
aspirations
of
mortal
man
various
sciences
we
might
go
over
the
of
ethnology
and
note
how
a
few
years
since
an
honored
american
investigator
proposing
in
a
learned
society
the
discussion
of
the
question
between
the
origin
of
the
human
race
from
a
single
pair
and
from
many
pairs
was
called
to
order
and
silenced
as
atheistic
by
a
protestant
divine
whose
memory
is
justly
dear
to
thousands
of
us
interesting
would
it
be
to
look
over
the
field
of
meteorology
beginning
with
the
conception
supposed
to
be
scriptural
of
angels
opening
and
shutting
the
windows
of
heaven
and
letting
out
the
waters
that
be
above
the
firmament
upon
the
earth
continuing
through
the
battle
of
fromundus
and
bodin
down
to
the
onslaught
upon
lecky
in
our
own
time
for
drawing
a
logical
and
scientific
conclusion
from
the
doctrine
that
meteorology
is
obedient
to
laws
we
might
go
over
the
of
cartography
and
see
how
at
one
period
on
account
of
expressions
in
ezekiel
any
map
of
the
world
which
did
not
place
jerusalem
in
the
centre
was
looked
on
as
impious
we
might
go
over
the
of
social
science
in
protestant
countries
and
note
the
opposition
of
conscientious
men
to
the
taking
of
the
census
in
sweden
and
in
the
united
states
on
account
of
the
terms
in
which
the
numbering
of
israel
is
spoken
of
in
the
old
testament
and
we
might
also
see
how
on
similar
grounds
religious
scruples
have
been
avowed
against
so
beneficial
a
thing
as
life
insurance
scientific
instruction
but
an
outline
of
this
kind
would
be
too
meagre
without
some
sketch
of
the
warfare
on
instruction
in
science
not
without
profit
would
it
be
to
note
more
at
length
how
instruction
in
the
copernican
theory
was
kept
out
of
the
church
universities
in
every
great
catholic
country
of
europe
how
they
concealed
the
discovery
of
the
spots
on
the
sun
how
many
of
them
excluded
the
newtonian
demonstrations
how
down
to
the
present
time
the
two
great
universities
of
protestant
england
and
nearly
all
her
intermediate
colleges
under
clerical
supervision
have
excluded
the
natural
and
physical
sciences
as
far
as
possible
and
how
from
probably
of
the
universities
and
colleges
of
the
united
states
the
students
are
graduated
with
either
no
knowledge
or
with
clerically
emasculated
knowledge
of
the
most
careful
modern
thought
on
the
most
important
problems
in
the
various
sciences
in
history
and
in
criticism
from
the
dismissal
of
the
scientific
professors
from
the
university
of
salamanca
by
ferdinand
vii
of
spain
in
the
beginning
of
this
century
down
to
sundry
dealings
with
scientific
men
in
our
own
land
and
time
we
might
study
another
interesting
phase
of
the
same
warfare
but
passing
all
this
i
shall
simply
present
a
few
typical
conflicts
that
have
occurred
within
the
last
ten
years
during
the
years
and
the
war
which
had
been
long
smouldering
in
france
between
the
church
and
the
whole
system
of
french
advanced
education
came
to
an
outbreak
toward
the
end
of
the
last
century
after
the
church
had
held
possession
of
advanced
instruction
in
france
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
had
so
far
as
it
was
able
made
experimental
science
contemptible
and
after
the
church
authorities
had
deliberately
resisted
and
wrecked
turgot
noble
plans
for
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
public
schools
the
french
nation
decreed
the
establishment
of
the
most
thorough
and
complete
system
of
the
higher
public
instruction
then
known
it
was
kept
under
lay
control
and
became
one
of
the
great
glories
of
france
but
emboldened
by
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
the
church
began
to
undermine
the
hated
system
and
in
had
made
such
progress
that
all
was
ready
for
an
assault
foremost
among
the
leaders
of
the
besieging
party
was
the
bishop
of
orleans
dupanloup
a
man
of
much
buzzing
vigor
in
various
ways
and
especially
in
an
open
letter
he
had
fought
the
materialism
of
the
school
of
medicine
at
paris
and
especially
were
his
attacks
leveled
at
professors
vulpian
and
see
and
the
minister
of
public
instruction
duruy
a
man
of
great
merit
whose
only
crime
was
a
quiet
resistance
to
clerical
control
in
these
writings
bishop
dupanloup
stigmatized
darwin
huxley
lyell
and
others
as
authors
of
shameful
theories
and
made
especial
use
of
the
recent
phrase
of
a
naturalist
that
it
is
more
glorious
to
be
a
monkey
perfected
than
an
adam
degenerated
the
direct
attack
was
made
in
the
french
senate
and
the
storming
party
in
that
body
was
led
by
a
venerable
and
conscientious
prelate
cardinal
de
bonnechose
it
was
charged
by
archbishop
de
bonnechose
and
his
party
that
the
tendencies
of
the
teachings
of
these
professors
were
fatal
to
religion
and
morality
a
heavy
artillery
of
phrases
was
hurled
such
as
sapping
the
foundations
breaking
down
the
bulwarks
and
withal
a
new
missile
was
used
with
much
effect
the
epithet
of
materialist
the
result
can
be
easily
guessed
crowds
came
to
the
of
these
professors
and
the
of
see
the
chief
offender
was
crowded
to
suffocation
a
siege
was
begun
in
due
form
a
young
physician
was
sent
by
the
cardinal
party
into
the
heterodox
camp
as
a
spy
having
heard
one
lecture
of
see
he
returned
with
information
that
seemed
to
promise
easy
victory
to
the
besieging
party
he
brought
a
terrible
statement
one
that
seemed
enough
to
overwhelm
see
vulpian
duruy
and
the
whole
hated
system
of
public
instruction
in
france
good
cardinal
bonnechose
seized
the
tremendous
weapon
rising
in
his
place
in
the
senate
he
launched
a
most
eloquent
invective
against
the
minister
of
state
who
could
protect
such
a
fortress
of
impiety
as
the
college
of
medicine
and
as
a
climax
he
asserted
on
the
evidence
of
his
spy
fresh
from
see
that
the
professor
had
declared
in
his
lecture
of
the
day
before
that
so
long
as
he
had
the
honor
to
hold
his
professorship
he
would
combat
the
false
idea
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
the
weapon
seemed
resistless
and
the
wound
fatal
but
duruy
rose
and
asked
to
be
heard
his
statement
was
simply
that
he
held
in
his
hand
documentary
proofs
that
see
never
made
such
a
declaration
he
held
the
notes
used
by
see
in
his
lecture
see
it
appeared
belonged
to
a
school
in
medical
science
which
combated
the
idea
of
an
art
in
medicine
the
inflamed
imagination
of
the
cardinal
too
eager
emissary
had
as
the
lecture
notes
proved
led
him
into
a
sad
mistake
as
to
words
and
thoughts
and
had
exhibited
see
as
treating
a
theological
when
he
was
discussing
a
purely
scientific
questions
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
the
professor
had
said
nothing
the
forces
of
the
enemy
were
immediately
turned
they
retreated
in
confusion
amid
the
laughter
of
all
france
and
a
quiet
dignified
statement
as
to
the
rights
of
scientific
instructors
by
wurtz
the
dean
of
the
faculty
completed
their
discomfiture
thus
a
attempt
to
check
what
was
feared
might
be
dangerous
in
science
simply
ended
in
bringing
ridicule
on
religion
and
thrusting
still
deeper
into
the
minds
of
thousands
of
men
that
most
mistaken
of
all
mistaken
ideas
the
conviction
that
religion
and
science
are
enemies
but
justice
forbids
our
raising
an
outcry
against
roman
catholicism
alone
for
this
in
a
number
of
excellent
men
in
england
drew
up
a
declaration
to
be
signed
by
students
in
the
natural
sciences
expressing
sincere
regret
that
researches
into
scientific
truth
are
perverted
by
some
in
our
time
into
occasion
for
casting
doubt
upon
the
truth
and
authenticity
of
the
holy
scriptures
of
the
leading
scientific
men
of
england
refused
to
sign
it
nor
was
this
the
worst
sir
john
herschel
sir
john
bowring
and
sir
hamilton
administered
through
the
press
castigations
which
roused
general
indignation
against
the
proposers
of
the
circular
and
de
morgan
by
a
parody
covered
memorial
and
memorialists
with
ridicule
it
was
the
old
mistake
and
the
old
result
followed
in
the
minds
of
multitudes
of
thoughtful
young
men
and
in
yet
another
protestant
country
this
same
wretched
mistake
was
made
in
several
excellent
churchmen
in
prussia
thought
it
their
duty
to
meet
for
the
denunciation
of
science
falsely
so
called
two
results
followed
upon
the
great
majority
of
these
really
men
whose
first
utterances
showed
crass
ignorance
of
the
theories
they
attacked
there
came
quiet
and
widespread
contempt
upon
pastor
knak
who
stood
forth
and
proclaimed
views
of
the
universe
which
he
thought
scriptural
but
which
most
schoolboys
knew
to
be
childish
came
a
burst
of
derision
from
every
quarter
of
the
german
nation
warfare
of
this
sort
against
science
seems
petty
indeed
but
it
is
to
be
guarded
against
in
protestant
countries
not
less
than
in
catholic
it
breaks
out
in
america
not
less
than
in
europe
i
might
exhibit
many
proofs
of
this
do
conscientious
roman
bishops
in
france
labor
to
keep
all
advanced
scientific
instruction
under
their
own
control
in
their
own
universities
and
colleges
so
do
very
many
not
less
conscientious
protestant
clergymen
in
our
own
country
insist
that
advanced
education
in
science
and
literature
shall
be
kept
under
control
of
their
own
sectarian
universities
and
colleges
wretchedly
in
their
development
and
miserably
inadequate
in
their
equipment
did
a
leading
spanish
university
until
a
recent
period
exclude
professors
holding
the
newtonian
theory
so
does
a
leading
american
college
exclude
professors
holding
the
darwinian
theory
have
catholic
colleges
in
italy
rejected
excellent
candidates
for
professorships
on
account
of
unsafe
views
regarding
the
immaculate
conception
so
are
protestant
colleges
in
america
every
day
rejecting
excellent
candidates
on
account
of
unsafe
views
regarding
the
apostolic
succession
or
the
incarnation
or
baptism
or
the
perseverance
of
the
saints
and
how
has
all
this
system
resulted
in
the
older
nations
by
natural
reaction
these
colleges
under
strict
ecclesiastical
control
have
sent
forth
the
most
bitter
enemies
the
christian
church
has
ever
known
of
whom
voltaire
and
renan
and
are
types
and
there
are
many
signs
that
the
same
causes
are
producing
the
same
result
in
our
own
country
i
might
allude
to
another
in
our
own
land
and
time
i
might
show
how
an
attempt
to
meet
the
great
want
in
the
state
of
new
york
of
an
institution
providing
scientific
instruction
has
been
met
with
loud
outcries
from
many
excellent
men
who
fear
injury
thereby
to
religion
i
might
picture
to
you
the
strategy
which
has
been
used
to
keep
earnest
young
men
from
an
institution
which
it
is
declared
can
not
be
christian
because
it
is
not
sectarian
i
might
lay
before
you
wonderful
lines
of
argument
which
have
been
made
to
show
the
dangerous
tendencies
of
a
plan
which
gives
to
scientific
studies
the
same
weight
as
to
classical
studies
and
which
lays
no
less
stress
on
modern
history
and
literature
than
on
ancient
history
and
literature
i
might
show
how
it
has
been
denounced
by
the
friends
and
agents
of
denominational
colleges
and
in
many
sectarian
journals
how
the
most
preposterous
charges
have
been
made
and
believed
by
good
men
how
the
epithets
of
godless
infidel
irreligious
unreligious
atheistic
have
been
hurled
against
a
body
of
christian
trustees
professors
and
students
and
with
little
practical
result
save
arousing
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
large
bodies
of
thoughtful
young
men
that
the
churches
dread
scientific
studies
untrammeled
by
sectarianism
summary
you
have
now
gone
over
the
greater
struggles
in
the
long
war
between
ecclesiasticism
and
science
and
have
glanced
at
the
lesser
fields
you
have
seen
the
conflicts
in
physical
geography
as
to
the
form
of
the
earth
in
astronomy
as
to
the
place
of
the
earth
in
the
universe
and
the
evolution
of
stellar
systems
in
accordance
with
law
in
chemistry
and
physics
in
anatomy
and
medicine
in
geology
in
meteorology
in
cartography
in
the
industrial
and
agricultural
sciences
in
political
economy
and
social
science
and
in
scientific
instruction
and
each
of
these
when
fully
presented
has
shown
the
following
results
in
every
case
whether
the
war
has
been
long
or
short
forcible
or
feeble
science
has
at
last
gained
the
victory
in
every
case
interference
with
science
in
the
supposed
interest
of
religion
has
brought
dire
evils
on
both
in
every
case
while
this
interference
during
its
continuance
has
tended
to
divorce
religion
from
the
most
vigorous
thinking
of
the
world
and
to
make
it
odious
to
multitudes
of
the
most
earnest
thinkers
the
triumph
of
science
has
led
its
former
conscientious
enemies
to
make
new
interpretations
and
lasting
adjustments
which
have
proved
a
blessing
to
religion
ennobling
its
conceptions
and
bettering
its
methods
and
in
addition
to
these
points
there
should
be
brought
out
distinctly
a
which
is
that
science
must
be
studied
by
its
own
means
and
to
its
own
ends
unmixed
with
the
means
and
unbiased
by
the
motives
of
investigators
in
other
fields
and
uncontrolled
by
consciences
unenlightened
by
itself
the
very
finger
of
the
almighty
seems
to
have
written
the
proofs
of
this
truth
on
human
history
no
one
can
gainsay
it
it
is
decisive
for
it
is
this
has
never
been
a
scientific
theory
framed
from
the
use
of
scriptural
texts
wholly
or
partially
which
has
been
made
to
such
attempts
have
only
subjected
their
authors
to
derision
and
christianity
to
suspicion
from
cosmas
finding
his
plan
of
the
universe
in
the
jewish
tabernacle
to
increase
mather
sending
mastodon
bones
to
england
as
the
remains
of
giants
mentioned
in
scripture
from
bellarmin
declaring
that
the
sun
can
not
be
the
centre
of
the
universe
because
such
an
idea
vitiates
the
whole
scriptural
plan
of
salvation
to
a
recent
writer
declaring
that
an
evolution
theory
can
not
be
true
because
paul
says
that
all
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
the
result
has
always
been
the
same
such
facts
show
that
scientific
hypothesis
will
be
established
or
refuted
by
scientific
men
and
scientific
methods
alone
and
that
no
conscientious
citation
of
texts
or
outcries
as
to
consequences
of
scientific
truths
from
any
other
quarter
can
do
any
thing
save
retard
truth
and
cause
needless
anxiety
such
facts
show
too
that
the
sacred
books
of
the
world
were
not
given
for
any
such
purpose
as
that
to
which
so
many
men
have
endeavored
to
wrest
them
the
purpose
served
by
compends
of
history
and
of
science
is
skepticism
feared
all
history
shows
that
the
only
skepticism
which
does
permanent
harm
is
skepticism
as
to
the
value
and
safety
of
truth
as
truth
no
skepticism
has
proved
so
corrosive
to
religion
none
so
cancerous
in
the
human
brain
and
heart
is
faith
cherished
all
history
shows
that
the
first
article
of
a
saving
faith
for
any
land
or
time
is
faith
that
there
is
a
power
in
this
universe
strong
enough
to
make
safe
and
good
enough
to
make
useful
may
we
not
then
hope
that
the
greatest
and
best
men
in
the
church
the
men
standing
at
centres
of
thought
will
insist
with
power
more
and
more
that
religion
be
no
longer
tied
to
so
injurious
a
policy
as
that
which
this
warfare
reveals
that
searchers
for
truth
whether
in
theology
or
natural
science
work
on
as
friends
sure
that
no
matter
how
much
at
variance
they
may
at
times
seem
to
be
the
truths
they
reach
shall
finally
be
fused
into
each
other
the
dominant
religious
conceptions
of
the
world
will
doubtless
be
greatly
modified
by
science
in
the
future
as
they
have
been
in
the
past
and
the
part
of
any
wisely
religious
person
at
any
centre
of
influence
is
to
see
that
in
his
generation
this
readjustment
of
religion
to
science
be
made
as
quietly
and
speedily
as
possible
no
one
needs
fear
the
result
no
matter
whether
science
shall
complete
her
demonstration
that
man
has
been
on
the
earth
not
merely
six
thousand
years
or
six
millions
of
years
no
matter
whether
she
reveals
new
ideas
of
the
creator
or
startling
relations
between
his
creatures
no
matter
how
many
more
gyves
and
clamps
upon
the
spirit
of
christianity
she
destroys
the
result
when
fully
thought
out
will
serve
and
strengthen
religion
not
less
than
science
what
science
can
do
for
the
world
is
shown
not
by
those
who
have
labored
to
concoct
palatable
mixtures
of
theology
and
science
men
like
cosmas
and
torrubia
and
burnet
and
whiston
but
by
men
who
have
fought
the
good
fight
of
faith
in
truth
for
truth
sake
men
like
roger
bacon
and
vesalius
and
palissy
and
galileo
what
christianity
can
do
for
the
world
is
shown
not
by
men
who
have
stood
on
the
high
places
screaming
in
wrath
at
the
advance
of
science
not
by
men
who
have
retreated
in
terror
into
the
sacred
caves
and
refused
to
look
out
upon
the
universe
as
it
is
but
by
men
who
have
preached
and
practised
the
righteousness
of
the
prophets
and
the
aspirations
of
the
psalmist
and
the
blessed
sermon
on
the
mount
and

first
great
commandment
and
the
second
which
is

it
and
james
definition
of
pure
religion

the

that
