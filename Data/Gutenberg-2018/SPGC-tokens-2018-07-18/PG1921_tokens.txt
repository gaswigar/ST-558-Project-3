i
an
ambuscade
early
in
the
year
at
the
beginning
of
vendemiaire
or
to
conform
to
our
own
calendar
towards
the
close
of
september
a
hundred
or
so
of
peasants
and
a
large
number
of
citizens
who
had
left
fougeres
in
the
morning
on
their
way
to
mayenne
were
going
up
the
little
mountain
of
la
pelerine
between
fougeres
and
ernee
a
small
town
where
travellers
along
that
road
are
in
the
habit
of
resting
this
company
divided
into
groups
that
were
more
or
less
numerous
presented
a
collection
of
such
fantastic
costumes
and
a
mixture
of
individuals
belonging
to
so
many
and
diverse
localities
and
professions
that
it
will
be
well
to
describe
their
characteristic
differences
in
order
to
give
to
this
history
the
vivid
local
coloring
to
which
so
much
value
is
attached
in
these
days
though
some
critics
do
assert
that
it
injures
the
representation
of
sentiments
many
of
the
peasants
in
fact
the
greater
number
were
barefooted
and
wore
no
other
garments
than
a
large
goatskin
which
covered
them
from
the
neck
to
the
knees
and
trousers
of
white
and
very
coarse
linen
the
texture
of
which
betrayed
the
slovenly
industrial
habits
of
the
region
the
straight
locks
of
their
long
hair
mingling
with
those
of
the
goatskin
hid
their
faces
which
were
bent
on
the
ground
so
completely
that
the
garment
might
have
been
thought
their
own
skin
and
they
themselves
mistaken
at
first
sight
for
a
species
of
the
animal
which
served
them
as
clothing
but
through
this
tangle
of
hair
their
eyes
were
presently
seen
to
shine
like
in
a
thicket
and
their
glances
full
of
human
intelligence
caused
fear
rather
than
pleasure
to
those
who
met
them
their
heads
were
covered
with
a
dirty
of
red
flannel
not
unlike
the
phrygian
cap
which
the
republic
had
lately
adopted
as
an
emblem
of
liberty
each
man
carried
over
his
shoulder
a
heavy
stick
of
knotted
oak
at
the
end
of
which
hung
a
linen
bag
with
little
in
it
some
wore
over
the
red
cap
a
coarse
felt
hat
with
a
broad
brim
adorned
by
a
sort
of
woollen
chenille
of
many
colors
which
was
fastened
round
it
others
were
clothed
entirely
in
the
coarse
linen
of
which
the
trousers
and
wallets
of
all
were
made
and
showed
nothing
that
was
distinctive
of
the
new
order
of
civilization
their
long
hair
fell
upon
the
collar
of
a
round
jacket
with
square
pockets
which
reached
to
the
hips
only
a
garment
peculiar
to
the
peasantry
of
western
france
beneath
this
jacket
which
was
worn
open
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
linen
with
large
buttons
was
visible
some
of
the
company
marched
in
wooden
shoes
others
by
way
of
economy
carried
them
in
their
hand
this
costume
soiled
by
long
usage
blackened
with
sweat
and
dust
and
less
original
than
that
of
the
other
men
had
the
historic
merit
of
serving
as
a
transition
between
the
goatskins
and
the
brilliant
almost
sumptuous
dress
of
a
few
individuals
dispersed
here
and
there
among
the
groups
where
they
shone
like
flowers
in
fact
the
blue
linen
trousers
of
these
last
and
their
red
or
yellow
waistcoats
adorned
with
two
parallel
rows
of
brass
buttons
and
not
unlike
stood
out
as
vividly
among
the
white
linen
and
shaggy
skins
of
their
companions
as
the
and
poppies
in
a
some
of
them
wore
wooden
shoes
which
the
peasants
of
brittany
make
for
themselves
but
the
greater
number
had
heavy
hobnailed
boots
and
coats
of
coarse
cloth
cut
in
the
fashion
of
the
old
regime
the
shape
of
which
the
peasants
have
religiously
retained
even
to
the
present
day
the
collars
of
their
shirts
were
held
together
by
buttons
in
the
shape
of
hearts
or
anchors
the
wallets
of
these
men
seemed
to
be
better
than
those
of
their
companions
and
several
of
them
added
to
their
marching
outfit
a
flask
probably
full
of
brandy
slung
round
their
necks
by
a
bit
of
twine
a
few
burgesses
were
to
be
seen
in
the
midst
of
these
as
if
to
show
the
extremes
of
civilization
in
this
region
wearing
round
hats
or
flapping
brims
or
caps
boots
or
shoes
and
gaiters
they
exhibited
as
many
and
as
remarkable
differences
in
their
costume
as
the
peasants
themselves
about
a
dozen
of
them
wore
the
republican
jacket
known
by
the
name
of
la
others
mechanics
no
doubt
were
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
one
color
those
who
had
most
pretension
to
their
dress
wore
coats
or
surtouts
of
blue
or
green
cloth
more
or
less
defaced
these
last
evidently
characters
marched
in
boots
of
various
kinds
swinging
heavy
canes
with
the
air
and
manner
of
those
who
take
heart
under
misfortune
a
few
heads
carefully
powdered
and
some
queues
tolerably
well
braided
showed
the
sort
of
care
which
a
beginning
of
education
or
prosperity
inspires
a
casual
spectator
observing
these
men
all
surprised
to
find
themselves
in
one
another
s
company
would
have
thought
them
the
inhabitants
of
a
village
driven
out
by
a
conflagration
but
the
period
and
the
region
in
which
they
were
gave
an
altogether
different
interest
to
this
body
of
men
any
one
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
civil
discords
which
were
then
agitating
the
whole
of
france
could
easily
have
distinguished
the
few
individuals
on
whose
fidelity
the
republic
might
count
among
these
groups
almost
entirely
made
up
of
men
who
four
years
earlier
were
at
war
with
her
one
other
and
rather
noticeable
sign
left
no
doubt
upon
the
opinions
which
divided
the
detachment
the
republicans
alone
marched
with
an
air
of
gaiety
as
to
the
other
individuals
of
the
troop
if
their
clothes
showed
marked
differences
their
faces
at
least
and
their
attitudes
wore
a
uniform
expression
of
citizens
and
peasantry
their
faces
all
bore
the
imprint
of
deepest
melancholy
their
silence
had
something
sullen
in
it
they
all
seemed
crushed
under
the
yoke
of
a
single
thought
terrible
no
doubt
but
carefully
concealed
for
their
faces
were
impenetrable
the
slowness
of
their
gait
alone
betraying
their
inward
communings
from
time
to
time
a
few
of
them
noticeable
for
the
rosaries
hanging
from
their
necks
dangerous
as
it
was
to
carry
that
sign
of
a
religion
which
was
suppressed
rather
than
abolished
shook
their
long
hair
and
raised
their
heads
defiantly
they
covertly
examined
the
woods
and
paths
and
masses
of
rock
which
flanked
the
road
after
the
manner
of
a
dog
with
his
nose
to
the
wind
trying
to
scent
his
game
and
then
hearing
nothing
but
the
monotonous
tramp
of
the
silent
company
they
lowered
their
heads
once
more
with
the
old
expression
of
despair
like
criminals
on
their
way
to
the
galleys
to
live
or
die
the
march
of
this
column
upon
mayenne
the
heterogeneous
elements
of
which
it
was
composed
and
the
divers
sentiments
which
evidently
pervaded
it
will
explain
the
presence
of
another
troop
which
formed
the
head
of
the
detachment
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
with
arms
and
baggage
marched
in
the
advance
commanded
by
the
of
a
we
may
mention
here
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
did
not
witness
the
drama
of
the
revolution
that
this
title
was
made
to
supersede
that
of
colonel
proscribed
by
patriots
as
too
aristocratic
these
soldiers
belonged
to
a
of
infantry
quartered
at
mayenne
during
these
troublous
times
the
inhabitants
of
the
west
of
france
called
all
the
soldiers
of
the
republic
this
nickname
came
originally
from
their
blue
and
red
uniforms
the
memory
of
which
is
still
so
fresh
as
to
render
a
description
superfluous
a
detachment
of
the
blues
was
therefore
on
this
occasion
escorting
a
body
of
recruits
or
rather
conscripts
all
displeased
at
being
taken
to
mayenne
where
military
discipline
was
about
to
force
upon
them
the
uniformity
of
thought
clothing
and
gait
which
they
now
lacked
entirely
this
column
was
a
contingent
slowly
and
with
difficulty
raised
in
the
district
of
fougeres
from
which
it
was
due
under
the
levy
ordered
by
the
executive
directory
of
the
republic
on
the
preceding
messidor
the
government
had
asked
for
a
hundred
million
of
francs
and
a
hundred
thousand
men
as
immediate
reinforcements
for
the
armies
then
fighting
the
austrians
in
italy
the
prussians
in
germany
and
menaced
in
switzerland
by
the
russians
in
whom
suwarow
had
inspired
hopes
of
the
conquest
of
france
the
departments
of
the
west
known
under
the
name
of
la
vendee
brittany
and
a
portion
of
lower
normandy
which
had
been
tranquil
for
the
last
three
years
thanks
to
the
action
of
general
hoche
after
a
struggle
lasting
nearly
four
seemed
to
have
seized
this
new
occasion
of
danger
to
the
nation
to
break
out
again
in
presence
of
such
aggressions
the
republic
recovered
its
pristine
energy
it
provided
in
the
first
place
for
the
defence
of
the
threatened
departments
by
giving
the
responsibility
to
the
loyal
and
patriotic
portion
of
the
inhabitants
in
fact
the
government
in
paris
having
neither
troops
nor
money
to
send
to
the
interior
evaded
the
difficulty
by
a
parliamentary
gasconade
not
being
able
to
send
material
aid
to
the
faithful
citizens
of
the
insurgent
departments
it
gave
them
its
possibly
the
government
hoped
that
this
measure
by
arming
the
insurgents
against
each
other
would
stifle
the
insurrection
at
its
birth
this
ordinance
the
cause
of
future
fatal
reprisals
was
thus
worded
independent
companies
of
troops
shall
be
organized
in
the
western
this
impolitic
step
drove
the
west
as
a
body
into
so
hostile
an
attitude
that
the
directory
despaired
of
immediately
subduing
it
consequently
it
asked
the
assemblies
to
pass
certain
special
measures
relating
to
the
independent
companies
authorized
by
the
ordinance
in
response
to
this
request
a
new
law
had
been
promulgated
a
few
days
before
this
history
begins
organizing
into
regular
legions
the
various
weak
and
scattered
companies
these
legions
were
to
bear
the
names
of
the
departments
sarthe
orne
mayenne
morbihan
and
these
legions
said
the
law
will
be
specially
employed
to
fight
the
chouans
and
can
not
under
any
pretence
be
sent
to
the
the
foregoing
irksome
details
will
explain
both
the
weakness
of
the
directory
and
the
movement
of
this
troop
of
men
under
escort
of
the
blues
it
may
not
be
superfluous
to
add
that
these
finely
patriotic
directorial
decrees
had
no
realization
beyond
their
insertion
among
the
statutes
no
longer
restrained
as
formerly
by
great
moral
ideas
by
patriotism
nor
by
terror
which
enforced
their
execution
these
later
decrees
of
the
republic
created
millions
and
drafted
soldiers
without
the
slightest
benefit
accruing
to
its
exchequer
or
its
armies
the
mainspring
of
the
revolution
was
by
clumsy
handling
and
the
application
of
the
laws
took
the
impress
of
circumstances
instead
of
controlling
them
the
departments
of
mayenne
and
were
at
this
time
under
the
command
of
an
old
officer
who
judging
on
the
spot
of
the
measures
that
were
most
opportune
to
take
was
anxious
to
wring
from
brittany
every
one
of
her
contingents
more
especially
that
of
fougeres
which
was
known
to
be
a
of
he
hoped
by
this
means
to
weaken
its
strength
in
these
formidable
districts
this
devoted
soldier
made
use
of
the
illusory
provisions
of
the
new
law
to
declare
that
he
would
equip
and
arm
at
once
all
recruits
and
he
announced
that
he
held
at
their
disposal
the
one
month
s
advanced
pay
promised
by
the
government
to
these
exceptional
levies
though
brittany
had
hitherto
refused
all
kinds
of
military
service
under
the
republic
the
levies
were
made
under
the
new
law
on
the
faith
of
its
promises
and
with
such
promptness
that
even
the
commander
was
startled
but
he
was
one
of
those
wary
old
who
are
hard
to
catch
napping
he
no
sooner
saw
the
contingents
arriving
one
after
the
other
than
he
suspected
some
secret
motive
for
such
prompt
action
possibly
he
was
right
in
ascribing
it
to
the
fact
of
getting
arms
at
any
rate
no
sooner
were
the
fougeres
recruits
obtained
than
without
delaying
for
laggards
he
took
immediate
steps
to
fall
back
towards
alencon
so
as
to
be
near
a
loyal
neighborhood
though
the
growing
disaffection
along
the
route
made
the
success
of
this
measure
problematical
this
old
officer
who
under
instruction
of
his
superiors
kept
secret
the
disasters
of
our
armies
in
italy
and
germany
and
the
disturbing
news
from
la
vendee
was
attempting
on
the
morning
when
this
history
begins
to
make
a
forced
march
on
mayenne
where
he
was
resolved
to
execute
the
law
according
to
his
own
good
pleasure
and
fill
the
companies
of
his
own
brigade
with
his
breton
conscripts
the
word
conscript
which
later
became
so
celebrated
had
just
now
for
the
first
time
taken
the
place
in
the
government
decrees
of
the
word
hitherto
applied
to
all
republican
recruits
before
leaving
fougeres
the
chief
secretly
issued
to
his
own
men
ample
supplies
of
ammunition
and
sufficient
rations
of
bread
for
the
whole
detachment
so
as
to
conceal
from
the
conscripts
the
length
of
the
march
before
them
he
intended
not
to
stop
at
ernee
the
last
stage
before
mayenne
where
the
men
of
the
contingent
might
find
a
way
of
communicating
with
the
chouans
who
were
no
doubt
hanging
on
his
flanks
the
dead
silence
which
reigned
among
the
recruits
surprised
at
the
manoeuvring
of
the
old
republican
and
their
lagging
march
up
the
mountain
excited
to
the
very
utmost
the
distrust
and
watchfulness
of
the
chief
whose
name
was
hulot
all
the
striking
points
in
the
foregoing
description
had
been
to
him
matters
of
the
keenest
interest
he
marched
in
silence
surrounded
by
five
young
officers
each
of
whom
respected
the
evident
preoccupation
of
their
leader
but
just
as
hulot
reached
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
he
turned
his
head
as
if
by
instinct
to
inspect
the
anxious
faces
of
the
recruits
and
suddenly
broke
silence
the
slow
advance
of
the
bretons
had
put
a
distance
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
between
themselves
and
their
escort
hulot
s
face
contorted
after
a
fashion
peculiar
to
himself
what
the
devil
are
those
dandies
up
to
he
exclaimed
in
a
sonorous
voice
creeping
instead
of
marching
i
call
at
his
first
words
the
officers
who
accompanied
him
turned
spasmodically
as
if
startled
out
of
sleep
by
a
sudden
noise
the
sergeants
and
corporals
followed
their
example
and
the
whole
company
paused
in
its
march
without
receiving
the
wished
for
halt
though
the
officers
cast
a
first
look
at
the
detachment
which
was
creeping
like
an
elongated
tortoise
up
the
mountain
of
la
pelerine
these
young
men
all
dragged
like
many
others
from
important
studies
to
defend
their
country
and
in
whom
war
had
not
yet
smothered
the
sentiment
of
art
were
so
much
struck
by
the
scene
which
lay
spread
before
their
eyes
that
they
made
no
answer
to
their
chief
s
remark
the
real
significance
of
which
was
unknown
to
them
though
they
had
come
from
fougeres
where
the
scene
which
now
presented
itself
to
their
eyes
is
also
visible
but
with
certain
differences
caused
by
the
change
of
perspective
they
could
not
resist
pausing
to
admire
it
again
like
those
dilettanti
who
enjoy
all
music
the
more
when
familiar
with
its
construction
from
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
the
traveller
s
eye
can
range
over
the
great
valley
of
couesnon
at
one
of
the
farthest
points
of
which
along
the
horizon
lay
the
town
of
fougeres
from
here
the
officers
could
see
to
its
full
extent
the
basin
of
this
intervale
as
remarkable
for
the
fertility
of
its
soil
as
for
the
variety
of
its
aspects
mountains
of
gneiss
and
slate
rose
on
all
sides
like
an
ampitheatre
hiding
their
ruddy
flanks
behind
forests
of
oak
and
forming
on
their
declivities
other
and
lesser
valleys
full
of
dewy
freshness
these
rocky
heights
made
a
vast
enclosure
circular
in
form
in
the
centre
of
which
a
meadow
lay
softly
stretched
like
the
lawn
of
an
english
garden
a
number
of
evergreen
hedges
defining
irregular
pieces
of
property
which
were
planted
with
trees
gave
to
this
carpet
of
verdure
a
character
of
its
own
and
one
that
is
somewhat
unusual
among
the
landscapes
of
france
it
held
the
teeming
secrets
of
many
beauties
in
its
various
contrasts
the
effects
of
which
were
fine
enough
to
arrest
the
eye
of
the
most
indifferent
spectator
at
this
particular
moment
the
scene
was
brightened
by
the
fleeting
glow
with
which
nature
delights
at
times
in
heightening
the
beauty
of
her
imperishable
creations
while
the
detachment
was
crossing
the
valley
the
rising
sun
had
slowly
scattered
the
fleecy
mists
which
float
above
the
meadows
of
a
september
morning
as
the
soldiers
turned
to
look
back
an
invisible
hand
seemed
to
lift
from
the
landscape
the
last
of
these
veils
a
delicate
vapor
like
a
diaphanous
gauze
through
which
the
glow
of
precious
jewels
excites
our
curiosity
not
a
cloud
could
be
seen
on
the
wide
horizon
to
mark
by
its
silvery
whiteness
that
the
vast
blue
arch
was
the
firmament
it
seemed
on
the
contrary
a
dais
of
silk
held
up
by
the
summits
of
the
mountains
and
placed
in
the
atmosphere
to
protect
that
beautiful
assemblage
of
fields
and
meadows
and
groves
and
brooks
the
group
of
young
officers
paused
to
examine
a
scene
so
filled
with
natural
beauties
the
eyes
of
some
roved
among
the
copses
which
the
sterner
tints
of
autumn
were
already
enriching
with
their
russet
tones
contrasting
the
more
with
the
of
the
meadows
in
which
they
grew
others
took
note
of
a
different
contrast
made
by
the
ruddy
fields
where
the
buckwheat
had
been
cut
and
tied
in
sheaves
like
stands
of
arms
around
a
bivouac
adjoining
other
fields
of
rich
ploughed
land
from
which
the
rye
was
already
harvested
here
and
there
were
dark
slate
roofs
above
which
puffs
of
white
smoke
were
rising
the
glittering
silver
threads
of
the
winding
brooks
caught
the
eye
here
and
there
by
one
of
those
optic
lures
which
render
the
soul
one
knows
not
how
or
why
perplexed
and
dreamy
the
fragrant
freshness
of
the
autumn
breeze
the
stronger
odors
of
the
forest
rose
like
a
waft
of
incense
to
the
admirers
of
this
beautiful
region
who
noticed
with
delight
its
rare
its
vigorous
vegetation
and
its
verdure
worthy
of
england
the
very
word
being
common
to
the
two
languages
a
few
cattle
gave
life
to
the
scene
already
so
dramatic
the
birds
sang
filling
the
valley
with
a
sweet
vague
melody
that
quivered
in
the
air
if
a
quiet
imagination
will
picture
to
itself
these
rich
fluctuations
of
light
and
shade
the
vaporous
outline
of
the
mountains
the
mysterious
perspectives
which
were
seen
where
the
trees
gave
an
opening
or
the
streamlets
ran
or
some
coquettish
little
glade
fled
away
in
the
distance
if
memory
will
color
as
it
were
this
sketch
as
fleeting
as
the
moment
when
it
was
taken
the
persons
for
whom
such
pictures
are
not
without
charm
will
have
an
imperfect
image
of
the
magic
scene
which
delighted
the
still
impressionable
souls
of
the
young
officers
thinking
that
the
poor
recruits
must
be
leaving
with
regret
their
own
country
and
their
beloved
customs
to
die
perhaps
in
foreign
lands
they
involuntarily
excused
a
tardiness
their
feelings
comprehended
then
with
the
generosity
natural
to
soldiers
they
disguised
their
indulgence
under
an
apparent
desire
to
examine
into
the
military
position
of
the
land
but
hulot
whom
we
shall
henceforth
call
the
commandant
to
avoid
giving
him
the
inharmonious
title
of
chief
of
a
was
one
of
those
soldiers
who
in
critical
moments
can
not
be
caught
by
the
charms
of
a
landscape
were
they
even
those
of
a
terrestrial
paradise
he
shook
his
head
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
contracted
the
thick
black
eyebrows
which
gave
so
stern
an
expression
to
his
face
why
the
devil
don
t
they
come
up
he
said
for
the
second
time
in
a
hoarse
voice
roughened
by
the
toils
of
war
you
ask
why
replied
a
voice
hearing
these
words
which
seemed
to
issue
from
a
horn
such
as
the
peasants
of
the
western
valleys
use
to
call
their
flocks
the
commandant
turned
sharply
round
as
if
pricked
by
a
sword
and
beheld
close
behind
him
a
personage
even
more
fantastic
in
appearance
than
any
of
those
who
were
now
being
escorted
to
mayenne
to
serve
the
republic
this
unknown
man
short
and
in
figure
and
had
a
head
like
a
bull
to
which
in
fact
he
bore
more
than
one
resemblance
his
nose
seemed
shorter
than
it
was
on
account
of
the
thick
nostrils
his
full
lips
drawn
from
the
teeth
which
were
white
as
snow
his
large
and
round
black
eyes
with
their
shaggy
brows
his
hanging
ears
and
tawny
hair
seemed
to
belong
far
less
to
our
fine
caucasian
race
than
to
a
breed
of
herbivorous
animals
the
total
absence
of
all
the
usual
characteristics
of
the
social
man
made
that
bare
head
still
more
remarkable
the
face
bronzed
by
the
sun
its
angular
outlines
presenting
a
sort
of
vague
likeness
to
the
granite
which
forms
the
soil
of
the
region
was
the
only
visible
portion
of
the
body
of
this
singular
being
from
the
neck
down
he
was
wrapped
in
a
sarrau
or
smock
a
sort
of
russet
linen
blouse
coarser
in
texture
than
that
of
the
trousers
of
the
less
fortunate
conscripts
this
sarrau
in
which
an
antiquary
would
have
recognized
the
saye
or
the
sayon
of
the
gauls
ended
at
his
middle
where
it
was
fastened
to
two
leggings
of
goatskin
by
slivers
or
thongs
of
wood
roughly
cut
some
of
them
still
covered
with
their
peel
or
bark
these
hides
of
the
to
give
them
the
name
by
which
they
were
known
to
the
peasantry
covered
his
legs
and
thighs
and
masked
all
appearance
of
human
shape
enormous
sabots
hid
his
feet
his
long
and
shining
hair
fell
straight
like
the
goat
s
hair
on
either
side
of
his
face
being
parted
in
the
centre
like
the
hair
of
certain
statues
of
the
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
our
cathedrals
in
place
of
the
knotty
stick
which
the
conscripts
carried
over
their
shoulders
this
man
held
against
his
breast
as
though
it
were
a
musket
a
heavy
whip
the
lash
of
which
was
closely
braided
and
seemed
to
be
twice
as
long
as
that
of
an
ordinary
whip
the
sudden
apparition
of
this
strange
being
seemed
easily
explained
at
first
sight
some
of
the
officers
took
him
for
a
recruit
or
conscript
the
words
were
used
indiscriminately
who
had
outstripped
the
column
but
the
commandant
himself
was
singularly
surprised
by
the
man
s
presence
he
showed
no
alarm
but
his
face
grew
thoughtful
after
looking
the
intruder
well
over
he
repeated
mechanically
as
if
preoccupied
with
anxious
thought
yes
why
don
t
they
come
on
do
you
know
you
because
said
the
gloomy
apparition
with
an
accent
which
proved
his
difficulty
in
speaking
french
there
maine
begins
pointing
with
his
huge
rough
hand
towards
ernee
and
bretagne
then
he
struck
the
ground
sharply
with
the
handle
of
his
heavy
whip
close
to
the
commandant
s
feet
the
impression
produced
on
the
spectators
by
the
laconic
harangue
of
the
stranger
was
like
that
of
a
in
the
midst
of
tender
music
but
the
word
harangue
is
insufficient
to
reproduce
the
hatred
the
desires
of
vengeance
expressed
by
the
haughty
gesture
of
the
hand
the
brevity
of
the
speech
and
the
look
of
sullen
and
energy
on
the
countenance
of
the
speaker
the
coarseness
and
roughness
of
the
man
chopped
out
as
it
seemed
by
an
axe
with
his
rough
bark
still
left
on
him
and
the
stupid
ignorance
of
his
features
made
him
seem
for
the
moment
like
some
demigod
he
stood
in
a
prophetic
attitude
as
though
he
were
the
genius
of
brittany
rising
from
a
slumber
of
three
years
to
renew
a
war
in
which
victory
could
only
be
followed
by
twofold
mourning
a
pretty
fellow
this
thought
hulot
he
looks
to
me
like
the
emissary
of
men
who
mean
to
argue
with
their
having
growled
these
words
between
his
teeth
the
commandant
cast
his
eyes
in
turn
from
the
man
to
the
valley
from
the
valley
to
the
detachment
from
the
detachment
to
the
steep
acclivities
on
the
right
of
the
road
the
ridges
of
which
were
covered
with
the
broom
and
gorse
of
brittany
then
he
suddenly
turned
them
full
on
the
stranger
whom
he
subjected
to
a
mute
interrogation
which
he
ended
at
last
by
roughly
demanding
where
do
you
come
from
his
eager
piercing
eye
strove
to
detect
the
secrets
of
that
impenetrable
face
which
never
changed
from
the
vacant
torpid
expression
in
which
a
peasant
when
doing
nothing
wraps
himself
from
the
country
of
the
gars
replied
the
man
without
showing
any
uneasiness
your
name
why
do
you
call
yourself
by
your
chouan
name
in
defiance
of
the
law
to
use
the
name
he
gave
to
himself
looked
at
the
commandant
with
so
genuine
an
air
of
stupidity
that
the
soldier
believed
the
man
had
not
understood
him
do
you
belong
to
the
recruits
from
fougeres
to
this
inquiry
replied
by
the
bucolic
i
don
t
know
the
hopeless
imbecility
of
which
puts
an
end
to
all
inquiry
he
seated
himself
by
the
roadside
drew
from
his
smock
a
few
pieces
of
thin
black
a
national
delicacy
the
dismal
delights
of
which
none
but
a
breton
can
understand
and
began
to
eat
with
stolid
indifference
there
seemed
such
a
total
absence
of
all
human
intelligence
about
the
man
that
the
officers
compared
him
in
turn
to
the
cattle
browsing
in
the
valley
pastures
to
the
savages
of
america
or
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
deceived
by
his
behavior
the
commandant
himself
was
about
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
his
own
misgivings
when
casting
a
last
prudence
glance
on
the
man
whom
he
had
taken
for
the
herald
of
an
approaching
carnage
he
suddenly
noticed
that
the
hair
the
smock
and
the
goatskin
leggings
of
the
stranger
were
full
of
thorns
scraps
of
leaves
and
bits
of
trees
and
bushes
as
though
this
chouan
had
lately
made
his
way
for
a
long
distance
through
thickets
and
underbrush
hulot
looked
significantly
at
his
adjutant
gerard
who
stood
beside
him
pressed
his
hand
firmly
and
said
in
a
low
voice
we
came
for
wool
but
we
shall
go
back
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
silently
in
astonishment
it
is
necessary
here
to
make
a
digression
or
the
fears
of
the
commandant
will
not
be
intelligible
to
those
persons
who
are
in
the
habit
of
doubting
everything
because
they
have
seen
nothing
and
who
might
therefore
deny
the
existence
of
and
the
peasantry
of
the
west
whose
conduct
in
the
times
we
are
speaking
of
was
often
sublime
the
word
gars
pronounced
ga
is
a
relic
of
the
celtic
language
it
has
passed
from
low
breton
into
french
and
the
word
in
our
present
speech
has
more
ancient
associations
than
any
other
the
gais
was
the
principal
weapon
of
the
gauls
gaisde
meant
armed
gais
courage
gas
force
the
word
has
an
analogy
with
the
latin
word
vir
man
the
root
of
virtus
strength
courage
the
present
dissertation
is
excusable
as
of
national
interest
besides
it
may
help
to
restore
the
use
of
such
words
as
gars
garcon
garconette
garce
garcette
now
discarded
from
our
speech
as
unseemly
whereas
their
origin
is
so
warlike
that
we
shall
use
them
from
time
to
time
in
the
course
of
this
history
she

a
famous
garce
was
a
compliment
little
understood
by
madame
de
stael
when
it
was
paid
to

little
village

her
exile
brittany
is
the
region
in
all
france
where
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
gauls
have
left
their
strongest
imprint
that
portion
of
the
province
where
even
to
our
own
times
the
savage
life
and
superstitious
ideas
of
our
rude
ancestors
still
continue

we
may
use

country

when
a

district
is
inhabited

has
just
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
inhabitants
call
them
the
gars
of
such
or
such
a
this
classic
name
is
a
reward
for
the
fidelity
with
which
they
struggle
to
preserve
the
traditions
of
the
language
and
manners
of
their
gaelic
ancestors
their
lives
show
to
this
day
many
remarkable
and
deeply
embedded
vestiges
of
the
beliefs
and
superstitious
practices
of
those
ancient
times
feudal
customs
are
still
maintained
antiquaries
find
druidic
monuments
still
standing
the
genius
of
modern
civilization
shrinks
from
forcing
its
way
through
those
impenetrable
primordial
forests
an
ferociousness
a
brutal
obstinacy
but
also
a
regard
for
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
a
complete
ignoring
of
our
laws
our
customs
our
dress
our
modern
coins
our
language
but
withal
a
patriarchal
simplicity
and
virtues
that
are
heroic
unite
in
keeping
the
inhabitants
of
this
region
more
impoverished
as
to
all
intellectual
knowledge
than
the
redskins
but
also
as
proud
as
crafty
and
as
enduring
as
they
the
position
which
brittany
occupies
in
the
centre
of
europe
makes
it
more
interesting
to
observe
than
canada
surrounded
by
light
whose
beneficent
warmth
never
reaches
it
this
region
is
like
a
frozen
coal
left
black
in
the
middle
of
a
glowing
fire
the
efforts
made
by
several
noble
minds
to
win
this
glorious
part
of
france
so
rich
in
neglected
treasures
to
social
life
and
to
prosperity
have
all
even
when
sustained
by
government
come
to
nought
against
the
inflexibility
of
a
population
given
over
to
the
habits
of
immemorial
routine
this
unfortunate
condition
is
partly
accounted
for
by
the
nature
of
the
land
broken
by
ravines
mountain
torrents
lakes
and
marshes
and
bristling
with
hedges
or
which
make
a
sort
of
citadel
of
every
field
without
roads
without
canals
and
at
the
mercy
of
prejudices
which
scorn
our
modern
agriculture
these
will
further
be
shown
with
all
their
dangers
in
our
present
history
the
picturesque
lay
of
the
land
and
the
superstitions
of
the
inhabitants
prevent
the
formation
of
communities
and
the
benefits
arising
from
the
exchange
and
comparison
of
ideas
there
are
no
villages
the
rickety
buildings
which
the
people
call
homes
are
sparsely
scattered
through
the
wilderness
each
family
lives
as
in
a
desert
the
only
meetings
among
them
are
on
sundays
and
in
the
parish
church
these
silent
assemblies
under
the
eye
of
the
rector
the
only
ruler
of
these
rough
minds
last
some
hours
after
listening
to
the
awful
words
of
the
priest
they
return
to
their
noisome
hovels
for
another
week
they
leave
them
only
to
work
they
return
to
them
only
to
sleep
no
one
ever
visits
them
unless
it
is
the
rector
consequently
it
was
the
voice
of
the
priesthood
which
roused
brittany
against
the
republic
and
sent
thousands
of
men
five
years
before
this
history
begins
to
the
support
of
the
first
chouannerie
the
brothers
cottereau
whose
name
was
given
to
that
first
uprising
were
bold
smugglers
plying
their
perilous
trade
between
laval
and
fougeres
the
insurrections
of
brittany
had
nothing
fine
or
noble
about
them
and
it
may
be
truly
said
that
if
la
vendee
turned
its
brigandage
into
a
great
war
brittany
turned
war
into
a
brigandage
the
proscription
of
princes
the
destruction
of
religion
far
from
inspiring
great
sacrifices
were
to
the
chouans
pretexts
for
mere
pillage
and
the
events
of
this
intestine
warfare
had
all
the
savage
moroseness
of
their
own
natures
when
the
real
defenders
of
the
monarchy
came
to
recruit
men
among
these
ignorant
and
violent
people
they
vainly
tried
to
give
for
the
honor
of
the
white
flag
some
grandeur
to
the
enterprises
which
had
hitherto
rendered
the
brigands
odious
the
chouans
remain
in
history
as
a
memorable
example
of
the
danger
of
uprousing
the
uncivilized
masses
of
the
nation
the
sketch
here
made
of
a
breton
valley
and
of
the
breton
men
in
the
detachment
of
recruits
more
especially
that
of
the
gars
who
so
suddenly
appeared
on
the
summit
of
mont
pelerine
gives
a
brief
but
faithful
picture
of
the
province
and
its
inhabitants
a
trained
imagination
can
by
the
help
of
these
details
obtain
some
idea
of
the
theatre
of
the
war
and
of
the
men
who
were
its
instruments
the
flowering
hedges
of
the
beautiful
valleys
concealed
the
combatants
each
field
was
a
fortress
every
tree
an
ambush
the
hollow
trunk
of
each
old
willow
hid
a
stratagem
the
place
for
a
fight
was
everywhere
sharpshooters
were
lurking
at
every
turn
for
the
blues
whom
laughing
young
girls
unmindful
of
their
perfidy
attracted
within
range
for
had
they
not
made
pilgrimages
with
their
fathers
and
their
brothers
imploring
to
be
taught
wiles
and
receiving
absolution
from
their
wayside
virgin
of
rotten
wood
religion
or
rather
the
fetichism
of
these
ignorant
creatures
absolved
such
murders
of
remorse
thus
when
the
struggle
had
once
begun
every
part
of
the
country
was
dangerous
in
fact
all
things
were
full
of
peril
sound
as
well
as
silence
attraction
as
well
as
fear
the
family
hearth
or
the
open
country
treachery
was
everywhere
but
it
was
treachery
from
conviction
the
people
were
savages
serving
god
and
the
king
after
the
fashion
of
red
indians
to
make
this
sketch
of
the
struggle
exact
and
true
at
all
points
the
historian
must
add
that
the
moment
hoche
had
signed
his
peace
the
whole
country
subsided
into
smiles
and
friendliness
families
who
were
rending
each
other
to
pieces
over
night
were
supping
together
without
danger
the
next
day
the
very
moment
that
commandant
hulot
became
aware
of
the
secret
treachery
betrayed
by
the
hairy
skins
of
he
was
convinced
that
this
peace
due
to
the
genius
of
hoche
the
stability
of
which
he
had
always
doubted
was
at
an
end
the
civil
war
he
felt
was
about
to
be
renewed
doubtless
more
terrible
than
ever
after
a
cessation
of
three
years
the
revolution
mitigated
by
the
events
of
the
thermidor
would
doubtless
return
to
the
old
terrors
which
had
made
it
odious
to
sound
minds
english
gold
would
as
formerly
assist
in
the
national
discords
the
republic
abandoned
by
young
bonaparte
who
had
seemed
to
be
its
tutelary
genius
was
no
longer
in
a
condition
to
resist
its
enemies
from
without
and
from
within
the
worst
and
most
cruel
of
whom
were
the
last
to
appear
the
civil
war
already
threatened
by
various
partial
uprisings
would
assume
a
new
and
far
more
serious
aspect
if
the
chouans
were
now
to
attack
so
strong
an
escort
such
were
the
reflections
that
filled
the
mind
of
the
commander
though
less
succinctly
formulated
as
soon
as
he
perceived
in
the
condition
of
s
clothing
the
signs
of
an
ambush
carefully
planned
the
silence
which
followed
the
prophetic
remark
of
the
commandant
to
gerard
gave
hulot
time
to
recover
his
the
old
soldier
had
been
shaken
he
could
not
hinder
his
brow
from
clouding
as
he
felt
himself
surrounded
by
the
horrors
of
a
warfare
the
atrocities
of
which
would
have
shamed
even
cannibals
captain
merle
and
the
adjutant
gerard
could
not
explain
to
themselves
the
evident
dread
on
the
face
of
their
leader
as
he
looked
at
eating
his
bread
by
the
side
of
the
road
but
hulot
s
face
soon
cleared
he
began
to
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
to
fight
for
the
republic
and
he
joyously
vowed
to
escape
being
the
dupe
of
the
chouans
and
to
fathom
the
wily
and
impenetrable
being
whom
they
had
done
him
the
honor
to
employ
against
him
before
taking
any
resolution
he
set
himself
to
study
the
position
in
which
it
was
evident
the
enemy
intended
to
surprise
him
observing
that
the
road
where
the
column
had
halted
was
about
to
pass
through
a
sort
of
gorge
short
to
be
sure
but
flanked
with
woods
from
which
several
paths
appeared
to
issue
he
frowned
heavily
and
said
to
his
two
friends
in
a
low
voice
of
some
emotion
we
re
in
a
devil
of
a
wasp
what
do
you
fear
asked
gerard
fear
yes
that
s
it
returned
the
commandant
i
have
always
had
a
fear
of
being
shot
like
a
dog
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
without
a
chance
of
crying
out
who
goes
there
pooh
said
merle
laughing
who
goes
there
is
all
are
we
in
any
real
danger
asked
gerard
as
much
surprised
by
hulot
s
coolness
as
he
was
by
his
evident
alarm
hush
said
the
commandant
in
a
low
voice
we
are
in
the
jaws
of
the
wolf
it
is
as
dark
as
a
pocket
and
we
must
get
some
light
luckily
we
ve
got
the
upper
end
of
the
slope
so
saying
he
moved
with
his
two
officers
in
a
way
to
surround
who
rose
quickly
pretending
to
think
himself
in
the
way
stay
where
you
are
vagabond
said
hulot
keeping
his
eye
on
the
apparently
indifferent
face
of
the
breton
and
giving
him
a
push
which
threw
him
back
on
the
place
where
he
had
been
sitting
friends
continued
hulot
in
a
low
voice
speaking
to
the
two
officers
it
is
time
i
should
tell
you
that
it
is
all
up
with
the
army
in
paris
the
directory
in
consequence
of
a
disturbance
in
the
assembly
has
made
another
clean
sweep
of
our
affairs
those
pentarchs
puppets
i
call
them
those
directors
have
just
lost
a
good
blade
bernadotte
has
abandoned
who
will
take
his
place
asked
gerard
eagerly
an
old
blockhead
a
pretty
time
to
choose
to
let
fools
sail
the
ship
english
rockets
from
all
the
headlands
and
those
cursed
chouan
cockchafers
in
the
air
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
some
one
behind
those
puppets
pulled
the
wire
when
they
saw
we
were
getting
the
worst
of
how
getting
the
worst
of
it
our
armies
are
beaten
at
all
points
replied
hulot
sinking
his
voice
still
lower
the
chouans
have
intercepted
two
couriers
i
only
received
my
despatches
and
last
orders
by
a
private
messenger
sent
by
bernadotte
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
ministry
luckily
friends
have
written
me
confidentially
about
this
crisis
fouche
has
discovered
that
the
tyrant
louis
xviii
has
been
advised
by
traitors
in
paris
to
send
a
leader
to
his
followers
in
la
vendee
it
is
thought
that
barras
is
betraying
the
republic
at
any
rate
pitt
and
the
princes
have
sent
a
man
a
vigorous
daring
full
of
talent
who
intends
by
uniting
the
chouans
with
the
vendeans
to
pluck
the
cap
of
liberty
from
the
head
of
the
republic
the
fellow
has
lately
landed
in
the
morbihan
i
was
the
first
to
hear
of
it
and
i
sent
the
news
to
those
knaves
in
paris
the
gars
is
the
name
he
goes
by
all
those
beasts
he
added
pointing
to
stick
on
names
which
would
give
a
to
honest
patriots
if
they
bore
them
the
gars
is
now
in
this
district
the
presence
of
that
fellow
and
again
he
signed
to
as
good
as
tells
me
he
is
on
our
back
but
they
can
t
teach
an
old
monkey
to
make
faces
and
you
ve
got
to
help
me
to
get
my
birds
safe
into
their
cage
and
as
quick
as
a
flash
too
a
pretty
fool
i
should
be
if
i
allowed
that
who
dares
to
come
from
london
with
his
british
gold
to
trap
me
like
a
crow
on
learning
these
secret
circumstances
and
being
well
aware
that
their
leader
was
never
unnecessarily
alarmed
the
two
officers
saw
the
dangers
of
the
position
gerard
was
about
to
ask
some
questions
on
the
political
state
of
paris
some
details
of
which
hulot
had
evidently
passed
over
in
silence
but
a
sign
from
his
commander
stopped
him
and
once
more
drew
the
eyes
of
all
three
to
the
chouan
gave
no
sign
of
disturbance
at
being
watched
the
curiosity
of
the
two
officers
who
were
new
to
this
species
of
warfare
was
greatly
excited
by
this
beginning
of
an
affair
which
seemed
to
have
an
almost
romantic
interest
and
they
began
to
joke
about
it
but
hulot
stopped
them
at
once
god
s
thunder
he
cried
don
t
smoke
upon
the
wasting
courage
for
nothing
is
like
carrying
water
in
a
basket
gerard
he
added
in
the
ear
of
his
adjutant
get
nearer
by
degrees
to
that
fellow
and
watch
him
at
the
first
suspicious
action
put
your
sword
through
him
as
for
me
i
must
take
measures
to
carry
on
the
ball
if
our
unseen
adversaries
choose
to
open
the
chouan
paid
no
attention
to
the
movements
of
the
young
officer
and
continued
to
play
with
his
whip
and
fling
out
the
lash
of
it
as
though
he
were
fishing
in
the
ditch
meantime
the
commandant
was
saying
to
merle
in
a
low
voice
give
ten
picked
men
to
a
sergeant
and
post
them
yourself
above
us
on
the
summit
of
this
slope
just
where
the
path
widens
to
a
ledge
there
you
ought
to
see
the
whole
length
of
the
route
to
ernee
choose
a
position
where
the
road
is
not
flanked
by
woods
and
where
the
sergeant
can
overlook
the
country
take
he
is
very
intelligent
this
is
no
laughing
matter
i
wouldn
t
give
a
farthing
for
our
skins
if
we
don
t
turn
the
odds
in
our
favor
at
while
merle
was
executing
this
order
with
a
rapidity
of
which
he
fully
understood
the
importance
the
commandant
waved
his
right
hand
to
enforce
silence
on
the
soldiers
who
were
standing
at
ease
and
laughing
and
joking
around
him
with
another
gesture
he
ordered
them
to
take
up
arms
when
quiet
was
restored
he
turned
his
eyes
from
one
end
of
the
road
to
the
other
listened
with
anxious
attention
as
though
he
hoped
to
detect
some
stifled
sound
some
echo
of
weapons
or
steps
which
might
give
warning
of
the
expected
attack
his
black
eye
seemed
to
pierce
the
woods
to
an
extraordinary
depth
perceiving
no
indications
of
danger
he
next
consulted
like
a
savage
the
ground
at
his
feet
to
discover
if
possible
the
trail
of
the
invisible
enemies
whose
daring
was
well
known
to
him
desperate
at
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
to
justify
his
fears
he
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
ascended
not
without
difficulty
one
or
two
hillocks
the
other
officers
and
the
soldiers
observing
the
anxiety
of
a
leader
in
whom
they
trusted
and
whose
worth
was
known
to
them
knew
that
his
extreme
watchfulness
meant
danger
but
not
suspecting
its
imminence
they
merely
stood
still
and
held
their
breaths
by
instinct
like
dogs
endeavoring
to
guess
the
intentions
of
a
huntsman
whose
orders
are
incomprehensible
to
them
though
they
faithfully
obey
him
the
soldiers
gazed
in
turn
at
the
valley
at
the
woods
by
the
roadside
at
the
stern
face
of
their
leader
endeavoring
to
read
their
fate
they
questioned
each
other
with
their
eyes
and
more
than
one
smile
ran
from
lip
to
lip
when
hulot
returned
to
his
men
with
an
anxious
look
a
young
sergeant
who
passed
for
the
wit
of
his
company
remarked
in
a
low
voice
where
the
deuce
have
we
poked
ourselves
that
an
old
trooper
like
hulot
should
pull
such
a
gloomy
face
he
s
as
solemn
as
a
council
of
hulot
gave
the
speaker
a
stern
look
silence
being
ordered
in
the
ranks
in
the
hush
that
ensued
the
lagging
steps
of
the
conscripts
on
the
creaking
sand
of
the
road
produced
a
recurrent
sound
which
added
a
sort
of
vague
emotion
to
the
general
excitement
this
indefinable
feeling
can
be
understood
only
by
those
who
have
felt
their
hearts
beat
in
the
silence
of
the
night
from
a
painful
expectation
heightened
by
some
noise
the
monotonous
recurrence
of
which
seems
to
distil
terror
into
their
minds
drop
by
drop
the
thought
of
the
commandant
as
he
returned
to
his
men
was
can
i
be
mistaken
he
glanced
with
a
concentrated
anger
which
flashed
like
lightning
from
his
eyes
at
the
stolid
immovable
chouan
a
look
of
savage
irony
which
he
fancied
he
detected
in
the
man
s
eyes
warned
him
not
to
relax
in
his
precautions
just
then
captain
merle
having
obeyed
hulot
s
orders
returned
to
his
side
we
did
well
captain
said
the
commandant
to
put
the
few
men
whose
patriotism
we
can
count
upon
among
those
conscripts
at
the
rear
take
a
dozen
more
of
our
own
bravest
fellows
with
lebrun
at
their
head
and
make
a
of
them
they
ll
support
the
patriots
who
are
there
already
and
help
to
shove
on
that
flock
of
birds
and
close
up
the
distance
between
us
i
ll
wait
for
the
captain
disappeared
the
commander
s
eye
singled
out
four
men
on
whose
intelligence
and
quickness
he
knew
he
might
rely
and
he
beckoned
to
them
silently
with
the
friendly
gesture
of
moving
the
right
forefinger
rapidly
and
repeatedly
toward
the
nose
they
came
to
him
you
served
with
me
under
hoche
he
said
when
we
brought
to
reason
those
brigands
who
call
themselves
chasseurs
du
roi
you
know
how
they
hid
themselves
to
swoop
down
on
the
at
this
commendation
of
their
intelligence
the
four
soldiers
nodded
with
significant
grins
their
heroically
martial
faces
wore
that
look
of
careless
resignation
to
fate
which
evidenced
the
fact
that
since
the
struggle
had
begun
between
france
and
europe
the
ideas
of
the
private
soldiers
had
never
passed
beyond
the
on
their
backs
or
the
bayonets
in
front
of
them
with
their
lips
drawn
together
like
a
purse
when
the
strings
are
tightened
they
looked
at
their
commander
attentively
with
inquiring
eyes
you
know
continued
hulot
who
possessed
the
art
of
speaking
picturesquely
as
soldier
to
soldiers
that
it
won
t
do
for
old
hares
like
us
to
be
caught
napping
by
the
chouans
of
whom
there
are
plenty
all
round
us
or
my
name
s
not
hulot
you
four
are
to
march
in
advance
and
beat
up
both
sides
of
this
road
the
detachment
will
hang
fire
here
keep
your
eyes
about
you
don
t
get
picked
off
and
bring
me
news
of
what
you
find
quick
so
saying
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
suspected
heights
along
the
road
the
four
men
by
way
of
thanks
raised
the
backs
of
their
hands
to
their
battered
old
hats
discolored
by
rain
and
ragged
with
age
and
bent
their
bodies
double
one
of
them
named
larose
a
corporal
to
hulot
remarked
as
he
clicked
his
musket
we
ll
play
em
a
tune
on
the
clarinet
they
started
two
to
right
and
two
to
left
of
the
road
and
it
was
not
without
some
excitement
that
their
comrades
watched
them
disappear
the
commandant
himself
feared
that
he
had
sent
them
to
their
deaths
and
an
involuntary
shudder
seized
him
as
he
saw
the
last
of
them
officers
and
soldiers
listened
to
the
gradually
lessening
sound
of
their
footsteps
with
feelings
all
the
more
acute
because
they
were
carefully
hidden
there
are
occasions
when
the
risk
of
four
lives
causes
more
excitement
and
alarm
than
all
the
slain
at
jemmapes
the
faces
of
those
trained
to
war
have
such
various
and
fugitive
expressions
that
a
painter
who
has
to
describe
them
is
forced
to
appeal
to
the
recollections
of
soldiers
and
to
leave
civilians
to
imagine
these
dramatic
figures
for
scenes
so
rich
in
detail
can
not
be
rendered
in
writing
except
at
interminable
length
just
as
the
bayonets
of
the
four
men
were
finally
lost
to
sight
captain
merle
returned
having
executed
the
commandant
s
orders
with
rapidity
hulot
with
two
or
three
sharp
commands
put
his
troop
in
line
of
battle
and
ordered
it
to
return
to
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
where
his
little
were
stationed
walking
last
himself
and
looking
backward
to
note
any
changes
that
might
occur
in
a
scene
which
nature
had
made
so
lovely
and
man
so
terrible
as
he
reached
the
spot
where
he
had
left
the
chouan
who
had
seen
with
apparent
indifference
the
various
movements
of
the
commander
but
who
was
now
watching
with
extraordinary
intelligence
the
two
soldiers
in
the
woods
to
the
right
suddenly
gave
the
shrill
and
piercing
cry
of
the
or
the
three
famous
smugglers
already
mentioned
were
in
the
habit
of
using
the
various
intonations
of
this
cry
to
warn
each
other
of
danger
or
of
any
event
that
might
concern
them
from
this
came
the
nickname
of
chuin
which
means
or
owl
in
the
dialect
of
that
region
this
corrupted
word
came
finally
to
mean
the
whole
body
of
those
who
in
the
first
uprising
imitated
the
tactics
and
the
signals
of
the
smugglers
when
hulot
heard
that
suspicious
sound
he
stopped
short
and
examined
the
man
intently
then
he
feigned
to
be
taken
in
by
his
stupid
air
wishing
to
keep
him
by
him
as
a
barometer
which
might
indicate
the
movements
of
the
enemy
he
therefore
checked
gerard
whose
hand
was
on
his
sword
to
despatch
him
but
he
placed
two
soldiers
beside
the
man
he
now
felt
to
be
a
spy
and
ordered
them
in
a
loud
clear
voice
to
shoot
him
at
the
next
sound
he
made
in
spite
of
his
imminent
danger
showed
not
the
slightest
emotion
the
commandant
who
was
studying
him
took
note
of
this
apparent
insensibility
and
remarked
to
gerard
that
fool
is
not
so
clever
as
he
means
to
be
it
is
far
from
easy
to
read
the
face
of
a
chouan
but
the
fellow
betrays
himself
by
his
anxiety
to
show
his
nerve
ha
ha
if
he
had
only
pretended
fear
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
stupid
brute
he
and
i
might
have
made
a
pair
i
came
very
near
falling
into
the
trap
yes
we
shall
undoubtedly
be
attacked
but
let
em
come
i
m
all
ready
as
he
said
these
words
in
a
low
voice
rubbing
his
hands
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
he
looked
at
the
chouan
with
a
jeering
eye
then
he
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
and
stood
in
the
road
with
his
favorite
officers
beside
him
awaiting
the
result
of
his
arrangements
certain
that
a
fight
was
at
hand
he
looked
at
his
men
composedly
there
ll
be
a
row
said
to
his
comrades
in
a
low
voice
see
the
commandant
is
rubbing
his
in
critical
situations
like
that
in
which
the
detachment
and
its
commander
were
now
placed
life
is
so
clearly
at
stake
that
men
of
nerve
make
it
a
point
of
honor
to
show
coolness
and
these
are
the
moments
in
which
to
judge
men
s
souls
the
commandant
better
informed
of
the
danger
than
his
two
officers
took
pride
in
showing
his
tranquillity
with
his
eyes
moving
from
to
the
road
and
thence
to
the
woods
he
stood
expecting
not
without
dread
a
general
volley
from
the
chouans
whom
he
believed
to
be
hidden
like
brigands
all
around
him
but
his
face
remained
impassible
knowing
that
the
eyes
of
the
soldiers
were
turned
upon
him
he
wrinkled
his
brown
cheeks
pitted
with
the
screwed
his
upper
lip
and
winked
his
right
eye
a
grimace
always
taken
for
a
smile
by
his
men
then
he
tapped
gerard
on
the
shoulder
and
said
now
that
things
are
quiet
tell
me
what
you
wanted
to
say
just
i
wanted
to
ask
what
this
new
crisis
means
commandant
was
the
reply
it
is
not
new
said
hulot
all
europe
is
against
us
and
this
time
she
has
got
the
whip
hand
while
those
directors
are
fighting
together
like
horses
in
a
stable
without
any
oats
and
letting
the
government
go
to
bits
the
armies
are
left
without
supplies
or
reinforcements
we
are
getting
the
worst
of
it
in
italy
we
ve
evacuated
mantua
after
a
series
of
disasters
on
the
trebia
and
joubert
has
just
lost
a
battle
at
novi
i
only
hope
massena
may
be
able
to
hold
the
swiss
passes
against
suwarow
we
re
done
for
on
the
rhine
the
directory
have
sent
moreau
the
question
is
can
he
defend
the
frontier
i
hope
he
may
but
the
coalition
will
end
by
invading
us
and
the
only
general
able
to
save
the
nation
is
unluckily
down
in
that
devilish
egypt
and
how
is
he
ever
to
get
back
with
england
mistress
of
the
mediterranean
bonaparte
s
absence
doesn
t
trouble
me
commandant
said
the
young
adjutant
gerard
whose
intelligent
mind
had
been
developed
by
a
fine
education
i
am
certain
the
revolution
can
not
be
brought
to
naught
ha
we
soldiers
have
a
double
mission
not
merely
to
defend
french
territory
but
to
preserve
the
national
soul
the
generous
principles
of
liberty
independence
and
rights
of
human
reason
awakened
by
our
assemblies
and
gaining
strength
as
i
believe
from
day
to
day
france
is
like
a
traveller
bearing
a
light
he
protects
it
with
one
hand
and
defends
himself
with
the
other
if
your
news
is
true
we
have
never
the
last
ten
years
been
so
surrounded
with
people
trying
to
blow
it
out
principles
and
nation
are
in
danger
of
perishing
alas
yes
said
hulot
sighing
those
clowns
of
directors
have
managed
to
quarrel
with
all
the
men
who
could
sail
the
ship
bernadotte
carnot
all
of
them
even
talleyrand
have
deserted
us
there
s
not
a
single
good
patriot
left
except
friend
fouche
who
holds
em
through
the
police
there
s
a
man
for
you
it
was
he
who
warned
me
of
a
coming
insurrection
and
here
we
are
sure
enough
caught
in
a
if
the
army
doesn
t
take
things
in
hand
and
manage
the
government
said
gerard
those
lawyers
in
paris
will
put
us
back
just
where
we
were
before
the
revolution
a
parcel
of
ninnies
what
do
they
know
about
governing
i
m
always
afraid
they
ll
treat
with
the
bourbons
said
hulot
thunder
if
they
did
a
pretty
pass
we
should
be
in
we
soldiers
no
no
commandant
it
won
t
come
to
that
said
gerard
the
army
as
you
say
will
raise
its
voice
and
provided
it
doesn
t
choose
its
words
from
pichegru
s
vocabulary
i
am
persuaded
we
have
not
hacked
ourselves
to
pieces
for
the
last
ten
years
merely
to
manure
the
flax
and
let
others
spin
the
well
interposed
captain
merle
what
we
have
to
do
now
is
to
act
as
good
patriots
and
prevent
the
chouans
from
communicating
with
la
vendee
for
if
they
once
come
to
an
understanding
and
england
gets
her
finger
into
the
pie
i
wouldn
t
answer
for
the
cap
of
the
republic
one
and
as
he
spoke
the
cry
of
an
owl
heard
at
a
distance
interrupted
the
conversation
again
the
commander
examined
whose
impassible
face
still
gave
no
sign
the
conscripts
their
ranks
closed
up
by
an
officer
now
stood
like
a
herd
of
cattle
in
the
road
about
a
hundred
feet
distant
from
the
escort
which
was
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
behind
them
stood
the
of
soldiers
and
patriots
picked
men
commanded
by
lieutenant
lebrun
hulot
cast
his
eyes
over
this
arrangement
of
his
forces
and
looked
again
at
the
picket
of
men
posted
in
advance
upon
the
road
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
he
was
about
to
give
the
order
to
march
when
the
tricolor
cockades
of
the
two
soldiers
he
had
sent
to
beat
the
woods
to
the
left
caught
his
eye
he
waited
therefore
till
the
two
others
who
had
gone
to
the
right
should
reappear
perhaps
the
ball
will
open
over
there
he
said
to
his
officers
pointing
to
the
woods
from
which
the
two
men
did
not
emerge
while
the
first
two
made
their
report
hulot
s
attention
was
distracted
momentarily
from
the
chouan
at
once
sent
his
owl
to
an
apparently
vast
distance
and
before
the
men
who
guarded
him
could
raise
their
muskets
and
take
aim
he
had
struck
them
a
blow
with
his
whip
which
felled
them
and
rushed
away
a
terrible
discharge
of
from
the
woods
just
above
the
place
where
the
chouan
had
been
sitting
brought
down
six
or
eight
soldiers
at
whom
several
men
had
fired
without
touching
him
vanished
into
the
woods
after
climbing
the
slope
with
the
agility
of
a
as
he
did
so
his
sabots
rolled
into
the
ditch
and
his
feet
were
seen
to
be
shod
with
the
thick
hobnailed
boots
always
worn
by
the
chouans
at
the
first
cries
uttered
by
the
chouans
the
conscripts
sprang
into
the
woods
to
the
right
like
a
flock
of
birds
taking
flight
at
the
approach
of
a
man
fire
on
those
scoundrels
cried
hulot
the
company
fired
but
the
conscripts
knew
well
how
to
shelter
themselves
behind
trees
and
before
the
soldiers
could
reload
they
were
out
of
sight
what
s
the
use
of
levies
in
the
departments
said
hulot
it
is
only
such
idiots
as
the
directory
who
would
expect
any
good
of
a
draft
in
this
region
the
assembly
had
much
better
stop
voting
more
shoes
and
money
and
ammunition
and
see
that
we
get
what
belongs
to
at
this
moment
the
two
skirmishers
sent
out
on
the
right
were
seen
returning
with
evident
difficulty
the
one
that
was
least
wounded
supported
his
comrade
whose
blood
was
moistening
the
earth
the
two
poor
fellows
were
down
the
slope
when
showed
his
ugly
face
and
took
so
true
an
aim
that
both
blues
fell
together
and
rolled
heavily
into
the
ditch
the
chouan
s
monstrous
head
was
no
sooner
seen
than
thirty
muzzles
were
levelled
at
him
but
like
a
figure
in
a
pantomime
he
disappeared
in
a
second
among
the
tufts
of
gorse
these
events
which
have
taken
so
many
words
to
tell
happened
instantaneously
and
in
another
moment
the
of
patriots
and
soldiers
had
joined
the
main
body
of
the
escort
forward
cried
hulot
the
company
moved
quickly
to
the
higher
and
more
open
ground
on
which
the
picket
guard
was
already
stationed
there
the
commander
formed
his
troop
once
more
into
line
of
battle
but
as
the
chouans
made
no
further
hostile
demonstrations
he
began
to
think
that
the
deliverance
of
the
conscripts
might
have
been
the
sole
object
of
the
ambuscade
their
cries
he
said
to
his
two
friends
prove
that
they
are
not
numerous
we
ll
advance
at
a
quick
step
and
possibly
we
may
be
able
to
reach
ernee
without
getting
them
on
our
these
words
were
overheard
by
one
of
the
patriot
conscripts
who
stepped
from
the
ranks
and
said
respectfully
general
i
have
already
fought
the
chouans
may
i
be
allowed
a
word
a
lawyer
whispered
hulot
to
merle
they
always
want
to
harangue
argue
away
he
said
to
the
young
man
general
the
chouans
have
no
doubt
brought
arms
for
those
escaped
recruits
now
if
we
try
to
outmarch
them
they
will
catch
us
in
the
woods
and
shoot
every
one
of
us
before
we
can
get
to
ernee
we
must
argue
as
you
call
it
with
cartridges
during
the
skirmish
which
will
last
more
time
than
you
think
for
some
of
us
ought
to
go
back
and
fetch
the
national
guard
and
the
militia
from
then
you
think
there
are
a
good
many
chouans
judge
for
yourself
citizen
he
led
hulot
to
a
place
where
the
sand
had
been
stirred
as
with
a
rake
then
he
took
him
to
the
opening
of
a
where
the
leaves
were
scattered
and
trampled
into
the
earth
unmistakable
signs
of
the
passage
of
a
large
body
of
men
those
were
the
gars
from
vitre
said
the
man
who
came
himself
from
fougeres
they
are
on
their
way
to
lower
what
is
your
name
asked
hulot
gudin
well
then
gudin
i
make
you
a
corporal
you
seem
to
me
trustworthy
select
a
man
to
send
to
fougeres
but
stay
yourself
with
me
in
the
first
place
however
take
two
or
three
of
your
comrades
and
bring
in
the
muskets
and
ammunition
of
the
poor
fellows
those
brigands
have
rolled
into
the
ditch
these
bretons
added
hulot
to
gerard
will
make
famous
infantry
if
they
take
to
gudin
s
emissary
started
on
a
run
to
fougeres
by
a
to
the
left
the
soldiers
looked
to
their
arms
and
awaited
an
attack
the
commandant
passed
along
their
line
smiling
to
them
and
then
placed
himself
with
his
officers
a
little
in
front
of
it
silence
fell
once
more
but
it
was
of
short
duration
three
hundred
or
more
chouans
their
clothing
identical
with
that
of
the
late
recruits
burst
from
the
woods
to
the
right
with
actual
howls
and
planted
themselves
without
any
semblance
of
order
on
the
road
directly
in
front
of
the
feeble
detachment
of
the
blues
the
commandant
thereupon
ranged
his
soldiers
in
two
equal
parts
each
with
a
front
of
ten
men
between
them
he
placed
the
twelve
recruits
to
whom
he
hastily
gave
arms
putting
himself
at
their
head
this
little
centre
was
protected
by
the
two
wings
of
men
each
which
manoeuvred
on
either
side
of
the
road
under
the
orders
of
merle
and
gerard
their
object
being
to
catch
the
chouans
on
the
flank
and
prevent
them
from
posting
themselves
as
among
the
trees
where
they
could
pick
off
the
blues
without
risk
to
themselves
for
in
these
wars
the
republican
troops
never
knew
where
to
look
for
an
enemy
these
arrangements
hastily
made
gave
confidence
to
the
soldiers
and
they
advanced
in
silence
upon
the
chouans
at
the
end
of
a
few
seconds
each
side
fired
with
the
loss
of
several
men
at
this
moment
the
two
wings
of
the
republicans
to
whom
the
chouans
had
nothing
to
oppose
came
upon
their
flanks
and
with
a
close
quick
volley
sent
death
and
disorder
among
the
enemy
this
manoeuvre
very
nearly
equalized
the
numerical
strength
of
the
two
parties
but
the
chouan
nature
was
so
intrepid
their
will
so
firm
that
they
did
not
give
way
their
losses
scarcely
staggered
them
they
simply
closed
up
and
attempted
to
surround
the
dark
and
little
party
of
the
blues
which
covered
so
little
ground
that
it
looked
from
a
distance
like
a
surrounded
by
the
swarm
the
chouans
might
have
carried
the
day
at
this
moment
if
the
two
wings
commanded
by
merle
and
gerard
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
in
two
volleys
which
took
them
diagonally
on
their
rear
the
blues
of
the
two
wings
ought
to
have
remained
in
position
and
continued
to
pick
off
in
this
way
their
terrible
enemies
but
excited
by
the
danger
of
their
little
main
body
then
completely
surrounded
by
the
chouans
they
flung
themselves
headlong
into
the
road
with
fixed
bayonets
and
made
the
battle
even
for
a
few
moments
both
sides
fought
with
a
stubbornness
intensified
by
the
cruelty
and
fury
of
the
partisan
spirit
which
made
this
war
exceptional
each
man
observant
of
danger
was
silent
the
scene
was
gloomy
and
cold
as
death
itself
nothing
was
heard
through
the
clash
of
arms
and
the
grinding
of
the
sand
under
foot
but
the
moans
and
exclamations
of
those
who
fell
either
dead
or
badly
wounded
the
twelve
loyal
recruits
in
the
republican
main
body
protected
the
commandant
who
was
guiding
his
men
and
giving
orders
with
such
courage
that
more
than
once
several
soldiers
called
out
bravo
conscripts
hulot
imperturbable
and
with
an
eye
to
everything
presently
remarked
among
the
chouans
a
man
who
like
himself
was
evidently
surrounded
by
picked
men
and
was
therefore
no
doubt
the
leader
of
the
attacking
party
he
was
eager
to
see
this
man
distinctly
and
he
made
many
efforts
to
distinguish
his
features
but
in
vain
they
were
hidden
by
the
red
caps
and
hats
of
those
about
him
hulot
did
however
see
beside
this
leader
repeating
his
orders
in
a
hoarse
voice
his
own
carbine
meanwhile
being
far
from
inactive
the
commandant
grew
impatient
at
being
thus
baffled
waving
his
sword
he
urged
on
the
recruits
and
charged
the
centre
of
the
chouans
with
such
fury
that
he
broke
through
their
line
and
came
close
to
their
chief
whose
face
however
was
still
hidden
by
a
felt
hat
with
a
white
cockade
but
the
invisible
leader
surprised
at
so
bold
an
attack
retreated
a
step
or
two
and
raised
his
hat
abruptly
thus
enabling
hulot
to
get
a
hasty
idea
of
his
appearance
he
was
young
hulot
thought
him
to
be
about
he
wore
a
of
green
cloth
and
a
white
belt
containing
pistols
his
heavy
shoes
were
hobnailed
like
those
of
the
chouans
leather
leggings
came
to
his
knees
covering
the
ends
of
his
breeches
of
very
coarse
drilling
and
completing
a
costume
which
showed
off
a
slender
and
figure
of
medium
height
furious
that
the
blues
should
thus
have
approached
him
he
pulled
his
hat
again
over
his
face
and
sprang
towards
them
but
he
was
instantly
surrounded
by
and
several
chouans
hulot
thought
he
perceived
between
the
heads
which
clustered
about
this
young
leader
a
broad
red
ribbon
worn
across
his
chest
the
eyes
of
the
commandant
caught
by
this
royal
decoration
then
almost
forgotten
by
republicans
turned
quickly
to
the
young
man
s
face
which
however
he
soon
lost
sight
of
under
the
necessity
of
controlling
and
protecting
his
own
little
troop
though
he
had
barely
time
to
notice
a
pair
of
brilliant
eyes
the
color
of
which
escaped
him
fair
hair
and
delicate
features
bronzed
by
the
sun
he
was
much
struck
by
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
the
neck
relieved
by
a
black
cravat
carelessly
knotted
the
fiery
attitude
of
the
young
leader
proved
him
to
be
a
soldier
of
the
stamp
of
those
who
bring
a
certain
conventional
poesy
into
battle
his
hand
waved
above
his
head
a
sword
which
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
his
whole
person
gave
an
impression
both
of
elegance
and
strength
an
air
of
passionate
enhanced
by
the
charms
of
youth
and
distinguished
manners
made
this
a
graceful
image
of
the
french
he
presented
a
strong
contrast
to
hulot
who
ten
feet
distant
from
him
was
quite
as
vivid
an
image
of
the
vigorous
republic
for
which
the
old
soldier
was
fighting
his
stern
face
his
blue
uniform
with
its
shabby
red
facings
and
its
blackened
epaulettes
hanging
back
of
his
shoulders
being
visible
signs
of
its
needs
and
character
the
graceful
attitude
and
expression
of
the
young
man
were
not
lost
on
the
commandant
who
exclaimed
as
he
pressed
towards
him
come
on
come
on
and
let
me
crush
you
the
royalist
leader
provoked
by
his
momentary
disadvantage
advanced
with
an
angry
movement
but
at
the
same
moment
the
men
who
were
about
him
rushed
forward
and
flung
themselves
with
fury
on
the
blues
suddenly
a
soft
clear
voice
was
heard
above
the
din
of
battle
saying
here
died
shall
we
not
avenge
him
at
the
magic
words
the
efforts
of
the
chouans
became
terrible
and
the
soldiers
of
the
republic
had
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
themselves
without
breaking
their
little
line
of
battle
if
he
wasn
t
a
young
man
thought
hulot
as
he
retreated
step
by
step
we
shouldn
t
have
been
attacked
in
this
way
who
ever
heard
of
the
chouans
fighting
an
open
battle
well
all
the
better
they
won
t
shoot
us
off
like
dogs
along
the
then
raising
his
voice
till
it
echoed
through
the
woods
he
exclaimed
come
on
my
men
shall
we
let
ourselves
be
by
those
brigands
the
word
here
given
is
but
a
feeble
equivalent
of
the
one
the
brave
commandant
used
but
every
veteran
can
substitute
the
real
one
which
was
far
more
soldierly
in
character
gerard
merle
added
hulot
call
in
your
men
form
them
into
a
battalion
take
the
rear
fire
upon
those
dogs
and
let
s
make
an
end
of
this
the
order
was
difficult
to
obey
for
the
young
chief
hearing
hulot
s
voice
cried
out
by
saint
anne
of
auray
don
t
let
them
get
away
spread
out
spread
out
my
lads
and
each
of
the
two
wings
of
the
blues
was
followed
by
chouans
who
were
fully
as
obstinate
and
far
superior
in
numbers
the
republicans
were
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
goatskins
uttering
their
savage
cries
which
were
more
like
howls
hold
your
tongues
gentlemen
cried
we
can
t
hear
ourselves
be
this
jest
revived
the
courage
of
the
blues
instead
of
fighting
only
at
one
point
the
republicans
spread
themselves
to
three
different
points
on
the
of
la
pelerine
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
woke
all
the
echoes
of
the
valleys
hitherto
so
peaceful
beneath
it
victory
might
have
remained
doubtful
for
many
hours
or
the
fight
might
have
come
to
an
end
for
want
of
combatants
for
blues
and
chouans
were
equally
brave
and
obstinate
each
side
was
growing
more
and
more
incensed
when
the
sound
of
a
drum
in
the
distance
told
that
the
body
of
men
must
be
crossing
the
valley
of
couesnon
there
s
the
national
guard
of
fougeres
cried
gudin
in
a
loud
voice
my
man
has
brought
the
words
reached
the
ears
of
the
young
leader
of
the
chouans
and
his
ferocious
and
the
royalists
made
a
hasty
retrograde
movement
checked
however
by
a
brutal
shout
from
after
two
or
three
orders
given
by
the
leader
in
a
low
voice
and
transmitted
by
in
the
breton
dialect
the
chouans
made
good
their
retreat
with
a
cleverness
which
disconcerted
the
republicans
and
even
the
commandant
at
the
first
word
of
command
they
formed
in
line
presenting
a
good
front
behind
which
the
wounded
retreated
and
the
others
reloaded
their
guns
then
suddenly
with
the
agility
already
shown
by
the
wounded
were
taken
over
the
brow
of
the
eminence
to
the
right
of
the
road
while
half
the
others
followed
them
slowly
to
occupy
the
summit
where
nothing
could
be
seen
of
them
by
the
blues
but
their
bold
heads
there
they
made
a
rampart
of
the
trees
and
pointed
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
on
the
republicans
who
were
rapidly
reformed
under
reiterated
orders
from
hulot
and
turned
to
face
the
remainder
of
the
chouans
who
were
still
before
them
in
the
road
the
latter
retreated
slowly
disputing
the
ground
and
wheeling
so
as
to
bring
themselves
under
cover
of
their
comrades
fire
when
they
reached
the
broad
ditch
which
bordered
the
road
they
scaled
the
high
bank
on
the
other
side
braving
the
fire
of
the
republicans
which
was
sufficiently
to
fill
the
ditch
with
dead
bodies
the
chouans
already
on
the
summit
answered
with
a
fire
that
was
no
less
deadly
at
that
moment
the
national
guard
of
fougeres
reached
the
scene
of
action
at
a
quick
step
and
its
mere
presence
put
an
end
to
the
affair
the
guard
and
some
of
the
soldiers
crossed
the
road
and
began
to
enter
the
woods
but
the
commandant
called
to
them
in
his
martial
voice
do
you
want
to
be
annihilated
over
there
the
victory
remained
to
the
republicans
though
not
without
heavy
loss
all
the
battered
old
hats
were
hung
on
the
points
of
the
bayonets
and
the
muskets
held
aloft
while
the
soldiers
shouted
with
one
voice
vive
la
republique
even
the
wounded
sitting
by
the
roadside
shared
in
the
general
enthusiasm
and
hulot
pressing
gerard
s
hand
exclaimed
ha
ha
those
are
what
i
call
merle
was
directed
to
bury
the
dead
in
a
ravine
while
another
party
of
men
attended
to
the
removal
of
the
wounded
the
carts
and
horses
of
the
neighborhood
were
put
into
requisition
and
the
suffering
men
were
carefully
laid
on
the
clothing
of
the
dead
before
the
little
column
started
the
national
guard
of
fougeres
turned
over
to
hulot
a
chouan
dangerously
wounded
whom
they
had
captured
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
up
which
his
comrades
had
escaped
and
where
he
had
fallen
from
weakness
thanks
for
your
help
citizens
said
the
commandant
god
s
thunder
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
we
should
have
had
a
pretty
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
take
care
of
yourselves
the
war
has
begun
adieu
then
turning
to
the
prisoner
he
asked
what
s
the
name
of
your
general
the
who
no
the
where
does
the
gars
come
from
to
this
question
the
prisoner
whose
face
was
convulsed
with
suffering
made
no
reply
he
took
out
his
beads
and
began
to
say
his
prayers
the
gars
is
no
doubt
that
young
with
the
black
cravat
sent
by
the
tyrant
and
his
allies
pitt
and
at
that
words
the
chouan
raised
his
head
proudly
and
said
sent
by
god
and
the
king
he
uttered
the
words
with
an
energy
which
exhausted
his
strength
the
commandant
saw
the
difficulty
of
questioning
a
dying
man
whose
countenance
expressed
his
gloomy
fanaticism
and
he
turned
away
his
head
with
a
frown
two
soldiers
friends
of
those
whom
had
so
brutally
killed
with
the
butt
of
his
whip
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
took
aim
at
the
chouan
whose
fixed
eyes
did
not
blink
at
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
fired
at
short
range
and
brought
him
down
when
they
approached
the
dead
body
to
strip
it
the
dying
man
found
strength
to
cry
out
loudly
vive
le
roi
yes
yes
you
canting
hypocrite
cried
go
and
make
your
report
to
that
virgin
of
yours
didn
t
he
shout
in
our
faces
vive
le
roi
when
we
thought
him
cooked
here
are
his
papers
commandant
said
ho
ho
cried
come
all
of
you
and
see
this
minion
of
the
good
god
with
colors
on
his
stomach
hulot
and
several
soldiers
came
round
the
body
now
entirely
naked
and
saw
upon
its
breast
a
blue
tattooing
in
the
form
of
a
swollen
heart
it
was
the
sign
of
initiation
into
the
brotherhood
of
the
sacred
heart
above
this
sign
were
the
words
marie
lambrequin
no
doubt
the
man
s
name
look
at
that
said
it
would
take
you
a
hundred
years
to
find
out
what
that
accoutrement
is
good
what
should
i
know
about
the
pope
s
uniform
replied
scornfully
you
worthless
you
ll
never
learn
anything
retorted
don
t
you
see
that
they
ve
promised
that
poor
fool
that
he
shall
live
again
and
he
has
painted
his
gizzard
in
order
to
find
himself
at
this
sally
which
was
not
without
some
foundation
even
hulot
joined
in
the
general
hilarity
at
this
moment
merle
returned
and
the
burial
of
the
dead
being
completed
and
the
wounded
placed
more
or
less
comfortably
in
two
carts
the
rest
of
the
late
escort
formed
into
two
lines
round
the
improvised
ambulances
and
descended
the
slope
of
the
mountain
towards
maine
where
the
beautiful
valley
of
la
pelerine
a
rival
to
that
of
couesnon
lay
before
it
hulot
with
his
two
officers
followed
the
troop
slowly
hoping
to
get
safely
to
ernee
where
the
wounded
could
be
cared
for
the
fight
we
have
just
described
which
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
midst
of
the
greater
events
which
were
soon
to
occur
was
called
by
the
name
of
the
mountain
on
which
it
took
place
it
obtained
some
notice
at
the
west
where
the
inhabitants
observant
of
this
second
uprising
noticed
on
this
occasion
a
great
change
in
the
manner
in
which
the
chouans
now
made
war
in
earlier
days
they
would
never
have
attacked
so
large
a
detachment
according
to
hulot
the
young
royalist
whom
he
had
seen
was
undoubtedly
the
gars
the
new
general
sent
to
france
by
the
princes
who
following
the
example
of
the
other
royalist
chiefs
concealed
his
real
name
and
title
under
one
of
those
pseudonyms
called
noms
de
this
circumstance
made
the
commandant
quite
as
uneasy
after
his
melancholy
victory
as
he
had
been
before
it
while
expecting
the
attack
he
turned
several
times
to
consider
the
of
la
pelerine
which
he
was
leaving
behind
him
across
which
he
could
still
hear
faintly
at
intervals
the
drums
of
the
national
guard
descending
into
the
valley
of
couesnon
at
the
same
time
that
the
blues
were
descending
into
that
of
la
pelerine
can
either
of
you
he
said
to
his
two
friends
guess
the
motives
of
that
attack
of
the
chouans
to
them
fighting
is
a
matter
of
business
and
i
can
t
see
what
they
expected
to
gain
by
this
attack
they
have
lost
at
least
a
hundred
men
and
we
he
added
screwing
up
his
right
cheek
and
winking
by
way
of
a
smile
have
lost
only
sixty
god
s
thunder
i
don
t
understand
that
sort
of
speculation
the
scoundrels
needn
t
have
attacked
us
we
might
just
as
well
have
been
allowed
to
pass
like
letters
through
the
post
no
i
don
t
see
what
good
it
has
done
them
to
our
men
he
added
with
a
sad
shake
of
his
head
toward
the
carts
perhaps
they
only
intended
to
say
to
but
they
carried
off
our
recruits
commander
said
merle
the
recruits
could
have
skipped
like
frogs
into
the
woods
at
any
time
and
we
should
never
have
gone
after
them
especially
if
those
fellows
had
fired
a
single
volley
returned
hulot
no
no
there
s
something
behind
all
again
he
turned
and
looked
at
la
pelerine
see
he
cried
see
there
though
they
were
now
at
a
long
distance
from
the
fatal
plateau
they
could
easily
distinguish
and
several
chouans
who
were
again
occupying
it
march
cried
hulot
to
his
men
open
your
compasses
and
trot
the
steeds
faster
than
that
are
your
legs
frozen
these
words
drove
the
little
troop
into
a
rapid
motion
there
s
a
mystery
and
it
s
hard
to
make
out
continued
hulot
speaking
to
his
friends
god
grant
it
isn
t
explained
by
muskets
at
ernee
i
m
very
much
afraid
that
we
shall
find
the
road
to
mayenne
cut
off
by
the
king
s
the
strategical
problem
which
troubled
the
commandant
was
causing
quite
as
much
uneasiness
to
the
persons
whom
he
had
just
seen
on
the
summit
of
mont
pelerine
as
soon
as
the
drums
of
the
national
guard
were
out
of
hearing
and
had
seen
the
blues
at
the
foot
of
the
declivity
he
gave
the
owl
s
cry
joyously
and
the
chouans
reappeared
but
their
numbers
were
less
some
were
no
doubt
busy
in
taking
care
of
the
wounded
in
the
little
village
of
la
pelerine
situated
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
which
looks
toward
the
valley
of
couesnon
two
or
three
chiefs
of
what
were
called
the
chasseurs
du
roi
clustered
about
a
few
feet
apart
sat
the
young
noble
called
the
gars
on
a
granite
rock
absorbed
in
thoughts
excited
by
the
difficulties
of
his
enterprise
which
now
began
to
show
themselves
screened
his
forehead
with
his
hand
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
looked
gloomily
at
the
road
by
which
the
blues
were
crossing
the
valley
of
la
pelerine
his
small
black
eyes
could
see
what
was
happening
on
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
the
blues
will
intercept
the
messenger
said
the
angry
voice
of
one
of
the
leaders
who
stood
near
him
by
saint
anne
of
auray
exclaimed
another
why
did
you
make
us
fight
was
it
to
save
your
own
skin
from
the
blues
darted
a
venomous
look
at
his
questioner
and
struck
the
ground
with
his
heavy
carbine
am
i
your
leader
he
asked
then
after
a
pause
he
added
pointing
to
the
remains
of
hulot
s
detachment
if
you
had
all
fought
as
i
did
not
one
of
those
blues
would
have
escaped
and
the
coach
could
have
got
here
they
d
never
have
thought
of
escorting
it
or
holding
it
back
if
we
had
let
them
go
by
without
a
fight
no
you
wanted
to
save
your
precious
skin
and
get
out
of
their
hands
he
has
bled
us
for
the
sake
of
his
own
snout
continued
the
orator
and
made
us
lose
twenty
thousand
francs
in
good
snout
yourself
cried
retreating
three
steps
and
aiming
at
his
aggressor
it
isn
t
that
you
hate
the
blues
but
you
love
the
gold
die
without
confession
and
be
damned
for
you
haven
t
taken
the
sacrament
for
a
this
insult
so
incensed
the
chouan
that
he
turned
pale
and
a
low
growl
came
from
his
chest
as
he
aimed
in
turn
at
the
young
chief
sprang
between
them
and
struck
their
weapons
from
their
hands
with
the
barrel
of
his
own
carbine
then
he
demanded
an
explanation
of
the
dispute
for
the
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
the
breton
dialect
an
idiom
with
which
he
was
not
familiar
monsieur
le
marquis
said
as
he
ended
his
account
of
the
quarrel
it
is
all
the
more
unreasonable
in
them
to
find
fault
with
me
because
i
have
left
behind
me
he
ll
know
how
to
save
the
coach
for
what
exclaimed
the
young
man
angrily
are
you
waiting
here
all
of
you
to
pillage
that
coach
a
parcel
of
cowards
who
couldn
t
win
a
victory
in
the
first
fight
to
which
i
led
you
but
why
should
you
win
if
that
s
your
object
the
defenders
of
god
and
the
king
are
thieves
are
they
by
saint
anne
of
auray
i
d
have
you
know
we
are
making
war
against
the
republic
and
not
robbing
travellers
those
who
are
guilty
in
future
of
such
shameful
actions
shall
not
receive
absolution
nor
any
of
the
favors
reserved
for
the
faithful
servants
of
the
a
murmur
came
from
the
group
of
chouans
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
authority
of
the
new
chief
was
about
to
be
disputed
the
young
man
on
whom
this
effect
of
his
words
was
by
no
means
lost
was
thinking
of
the
best
means
of
maintaining
the
dignity
of
his
command
when
the
trot
of
a
horse
was
heard
in
the
vicinity
all
heads
turned
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
a
lady
appeared
sitting
astride
of
a
little
breton
horse
which
she
put
at
a
gallop
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
young
leader
so
as
to
reach
the
group
of
chouans
as
quickly
as
possible
what
is
the
matter
she
said
looking
first
at
the
chouans
and
then
at
their
chief
could
you
believe
it
madame
they
are
waiting
to
rob
the
diligence
from
mayenne
to
fougeres
when
we
have
just
had
a
skirmish
in
order
to
release
the
conscripts
of
fougeres
which
has
cost
us
a
great
many
men
without
defeating
the
well
where
s
the
harm
of
that
asked
the
young
lady
to
whom
the
natural
shrewdness
of
a
woman
explained
the
whole
scene
you
have
lost
men
but
there
s
no
lack
of
others
the
coach
is
bringing
gold
and
there
s
always
a
lack
of
that
we
bury
men
who
go
to
heaven
and
we
take
money
which
goes
into
the
pockets
of
heroes
i
don
t
see
the
the
chouans
approved
of
her
speech
by
unanimous
smiles
do
you
see
nothing
in
all
that
to
make
you
blush
said
the
young
man
in
a
low
voice
are
you
in
such
need
of
money
that
you
must
pillage
on
the
i
am
so
eager
for
it
marquis
that
i
should
put
my
heart
in
pawn
if
it
were
not
already
captured
she
said
smiling
coquettishly
but
where
did
you
get
the
strange
idea
that
you
could
manage
chouans
without
letting
them
rob
a
few
blues
here
and
there
don
t
you
know
the
saying
thieving
as
an
owl
and
that
s
a
chouan
besides
she
said
raising
her
voice
to
be
heard
by
the
men
it
is
just
haven
t
the
blues
seized
the
property
of
the
church
and
our
own
another
murmur
very
different
from
the
growl
with
which
the
chouans
had
answered
their
leader
greeted
these
words
the
young
man
s
face
grew
darker
he
took
the
young
lady
aside
and
said
in
the
annoyed
tone
of
a
man
will
those
gentlemen
be
at
la
vivetiere
on
the
appointed
day
yes
she
replied
all
of
them
the
claimant
and
perhaps
then
allow
me
to
return
there
i
can
not
sanction
such
robbery
yes
madame
i
call
it
robbery
there
may
be
honor
in
being
robbed
but
well
well
she
said
interrupting
him
then
i
shall
have
your
share
of
the
booty
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
giving
it
up
to
me
the
extra
sum
will
be
extremely
useful
for
my
mother
has
delayed
sending
me
money
so
that
i
am
almost
adieu
cried
the
marquis
he
turned
away
but
the
lady
ran
after
him
why
won
t
you
stay
with
me
she
said
giving
him
the
look
with
which
women
who
have
a
right
to
a
man
s
respect
let
him
know
their
wishes
you
are
going
to
pillage
that
coach
pillage
what
a
word
she
said
let
me
explain
to
you
explain
nothing
he
said
taking
her
hand
and
kissing
it
with
the
superficial
gallantry
of
a
courtier
listen
to
me
he
added
after
a
short
pause
if
i
were
to
stay
here
while
they
capture
that
diligence
our
people
would
kill
me
for
i
should
certainly
not
kill
them
she
said
quickly
for
they
would
bind
your
hands
with
all
the
respect
that
is
due
to
your
rank
then
having
levied
the
necessary
contribution
for
their
equipment
subsistence
and
munitions
from
our
enemies
they
would
unbind
you
and
obey
you
and
you
wish
me
to
command
such
men
under
such
circumstances
if
my
life
is
necessary
to
the
cause
which
i
defend
allow
me
at
any
rate
to
save
the
honor
of
my
position
if
i
withdraw
now
i
can
ignore
this
base
act
i
will
return
in
order
to
escort
so
saying
he
rapidly
disappeared
the
young
lady
listened
to
his
receding
steps
with
evident
displeasure
when
the
sound
on
the
dried
leaves
ceased
she
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
confounded
then
she
hastily
returned
to
the
chouans
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
she
said
to
who
helped
her
to
dismount
that
young
man
wants
to
make
regular
war
on
the
republic
ah
well
he
ll
get
over
that
in
a
few
days
how
he
treated
me
she
thought
presently
she
seated
herself
on
the
rock
where
the
marquis
had
been
sitting
and
silently
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
coach
it
was
one
of
the
phenomena
of
the
times
and
not
the
least
of
them
that
this
young
and
noble
lady
should
be
flung
by
violent
partisanship
into
the
struggle
of
monarchies
against
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
be
driven
by
the
strength
of
her
feelings
into
actions
of
which
it
may
almost
be
said
she
was
not
conscious
in
this
she
resembled
others
of
her
time
who
were
led
away
by
an
enthusiasm
which
was
often
productive
of
noble
deeds
like
her
many
women
played
heroic
or
blameworthy
parts
in
the
fierce
struggle
the
royalist
cause
had
no
emissaries
so
devoted
and
so
active
as
these
women
but
none
of
the
heroines
on
that
side
paid
for
mistaken
devotion
or
for
actions
forbidden
to
their
sex
with
a
greater
expiation
than
did
this
lady
when
seated
on
that
wayside
rock
she
was
forced
to
admire
the
young
leader
s
noble
disdain
and
loyalty
to
principle
insensibly
she
dropped
into
reverie
bitter
memories
made
her
long
for
the
innocence
of
her
early
years
and
regret
that
she
had
escaped
being
a
victim
of
the
revolution
whose
victorious
march
could
no
longer
be
arrested
by
feeble
hands
the
coach
which
as
we
now
see
had
much
to
do
with
the
attack
of
the
chouans
had
started
from
the
little
town
of
ernee
a
few
moments
before
the
skirmishing
began
nothing
pictures
a
region
so
well
as
the
state
of
its
social
material
from
this
point
of
view
the
coach
deserves
a
mention
the
revolution
itself
was
powerless
to
destroy
it
in
fact
it
still
rolls
to
this
present
day
when
turgot
bought
up
the
privileges
of
a
company
obtained
under
louis
for
the
exclusive
right
of
transporting
travellers
from
one
part
of
the
kingdom
to
another
and
instituted
the
lines
of
coaches
called
the
turgotines
all
the
old
vehicles
of
the
former
company
flocked
into
the
provinces
one
of
these
shabby
coaches
was
now
plying
between
mayenne
and
fougeres
a
few
objectors
called
it
the
turgotine
partly
to
mimic
paris
and
partly
to
deride
a
minister
who
attempted
innovations
this
turgotine
was
a
wretched
cabriolet
on
two
high
wheels
in
the
depths
of
which
two
persons
if
rather
fat
could
with
difficulty
have
stowed
themselves
the
narrow
quarters
of
this
rickety
machine
not
admitting
of
any
crowding
and
the
box
which
formed
the
seat
being
kept
exclusively
for
the
postal
service
the
travellers
who
had
any
baggage
were
forced
to
keep
it
between
their
legs
already
tortured
by
being
squeezed
into
a
sort
of
little
box
in
shape
like
a
bellows
the
original
color
of
coach
and
was
an
insoluble
enigma
two
leather
curtains
very
difficult
to
adjust
in
spite
of
their
long
service
were
supposed
to
protect
the
occupants
from
cold
and
rain
the
driver
perched
on
a
plank
seat
like
those
of
the
worst
parisian
coucous
shared
in
the
conversation
by
reason
of
his
position
between
his
victims
biped
and
quadruped
the
equipage
presented
various
fantastic
resemblances
to
decrepit
old
men
who
have
gone
through
a
goodly
number
of
catarrhs
and
apoplexies
and
whom
death
respects
it
moaned
as
it
rolled
and
squeaked
spasmodically
like
a
traveller
overtaken
by
sleep
it
rocked
alternately
forward
and
back
as
though
it
tried
to
resist
the
violent
action
of
two
little
breton
horses
which
dragged
it
along
a
road
which
was
more
than
rough
this
monument
of
a
past
era
contained
three
travellers
who
on
leaving
ernee
where
they
had
changed
horses
continued
a
conversation
begun
with
the
driver
before
reaching
the
little
town
what
makes
you
think
the
chouans
are
hereabouts
said
the
coachman
the
ernee
people
tell
me
that
commandant
hulot
has
not
yet
started
from
ho
ho
friend
driver
said
the
youngest
of
the
travellers
you
risk
nothing
but
your
own
carcass
if
you
had
a
thousand
francs
about
you
as
i
have
and
were
known
to
be
a
good
patriot
you
wouldn
t
take
it
so
you
are
pretty
free
with
your
tongue
any
way
said
the
driver
shaking
his
head
count
your
lambs
and
the
wolf
will
eat
them
remarked
another
of
the
travellers
this
man
who
was
dressed
in
black
seemed
to
be
about
forty
years
old
and
was
probably
the
rector
of
some
parish
in
the
neighborhood
his
chin
rested
on
a
double
fold
of
flesh
and
his
florid
complexion
indicated
a
priest
though
short
and
fat
he
displayed
some
agility
when
required
to
get
in
or
out
of
the
vehicle
perhaps
you
are
both
chouans
cried
the
man
of
the
thousand
francs
whose
ample
goatskin
covering
trousers
of
good
cloth
and
a
clean
waistcoat
bespoke
a
rich
farmer
by
the
soul
of
saint
robespierre
i
swear
you
shall
be
roughly
he
turned
his
gray
eyes
from
the
driver
to
his
and
showed
them
a
pistol
in
his
belt
bretons
are
not
afraid
of
that
said
the
rector
disdainfully
besides
do
we
look
like
men
who
want
your
money
every
time
the
word
money
was
mentioned
the
driver
was
silent
and
the
rector
had
wit
enough
to
doubt
whether
the
patriot
had
any
at
all
and
to
suspect
that
the
driver
was
carrying
a
good
deal
are
you
well
laden
coupiau
he
asked
oh
no
monsieur
gudin
replied
the
coachman
i
m
carrying
next
to
the
priest
watched
the
faces
of
the
patriot
and
coupiau
as
the
latter
made
this
answer
and
both
were
imperturbable
so
much
the
better
for
you
remarked
the
patriot
i
can
now
take
measures
to
save
my
property
in
case
of
such
despotic
assumption
nettled
coupiau
who
answered
gruffly
i
am
the
master
of
my
own
carriage
and
so
long
as
i
drive
you
are
you
a
patriot
or
are
you
a
chouan
said
the
other
sharply
interrupting
him
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
replied
coupiau
i
m
a
postilion
and
what
is
more
a
breton
consequently
i
fear
neither
blues
nor
noble
thieves
cried
the
patriot
ironically
they
only
take
back
what
was
stolen
from
them
said
the
rector
vehemently
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
the
whites
of
their
eyes
if
we
may
use
a
phrase
so
colloquial
sitting
back
in
the
vehicle
was
a
third
traveller
who
took
no
part
in
the
discussion
and
preserved
a
deep
silence
the
driver
and
the
patriot
and
even
gudin
paid
no
attention
to
this
mute
individual
he
was
in
truth
one
of
those
uncomfortable
unsocial
travellers
who
are
found
sometimes
in
a
like
a
patient
calf
that
is
being
carried
bound
to
the
nearest
market
such
travellers
begin
by
filling
their
legal
space
and
end
by
sleeping
without
the
smallest
respect
for
their
on
a
neighbor
s
shoulder
the
patriot
gudin
and
the
driver
had
let
him
alone
thinking
him
asleep
after
discovering
that
it
was
useless
to
talk
to
a
man
whose
stolid
face
betrayed
an
existence
spent
in
measuring
yards
of
linen
and
an
intellect
employed
in
selling
them
at
a
good
percentage
above
cost
this
fat
little
man
in
his
corner
opened
his
eyes
every
now
and
then
and
looked
at
each
speaker
with
a
sort
of
terror
he
appeared
to
be
afraid
of
his
and
to
care
very
little
about
the
chouans
when
he
looked
at
the
driver
however
they
seemed
to
be
a
pair
of
just
then
the
first
volley
of
musketry
was
heard
on
la
pelerine
coupiau
frightened
stopped
the
coach
oh
oh
said
the
priest
as
if
he
had
some
means
of
judging
it
is
a
serious
engagement
there
are
many
the
trouble
for
us
monsieur
gudin
cried
coupiau
is
to
know
which
side
will
the
faces
of
all
became
unanimously
anxious
let
us
put
up
the
coach
at
that
inn
which
i
see
over
there
said
the
patriot
we
can
hide
it
till
we
know
the
result
of
the
the
advice
seemed
so
good
that
coupiau
followed
it
the
patriot
helped
him
to
conceal
the
coach
behind
a
the
abbe
seized
the
occasion
to
pull
coupiau
aside
and
say
to
him
in
a
low
voice
has
he
really
any
money
hey
monsieur
gudin
if
it
gets
into
the
pockets
of
your
reverence
they
won
t
be
weighed
down
with
when
the
blues
marched
by
after
the
encounter
on
la
pelerine
they
were
in
such
haste
to
reach
ernee
that
they
passed
the
little
inn
without
halting
at
the
sound
of
their
hasty
march
gudin
and
the
innkeeper
stirred
by
curiosity
went
to
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
to
watch
them
suddenly
the
fat
ecclesiastic
rushed
to
a
soldier
who
was
lagging
in
the
rear
gudin
he
cried
you
fellow
have
you
joined
the
blues
my
lad
you
are
surely
not
in
earnest
yes
uncle
answered
the
corporal
i
ve
sworn
to
defend
unhappy
boy
you
ll
lose
your
soul
said
the
uncle
trying
to
rouse
his
nephew
to
the
religious
sentiments
which
are
so
powerful
in
the
breton
breast
uncle
said
the
young
man
if
the
king
had
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
armies
i
don
t
say
but
what
fool
who
is
talking
to
you
about
the
king
does
your
republic
give
abbeys
no
it
has
upset
everything
how
do
you
expect
to
get
on
in
life
stay
with
us
sooner
or
later
we
shall
triumph
and
you
ll
be
counsellor
to
some
parliaments
said
young
gudin
in
a
mocking
tone
you
sha
n
t
have
a
penny
at
my
death
cried
his
uncle
in
a
rage
i
ll
disinherit
thank
you
uncle
said
the
republican
as
they
parted
the
fumes
of
the
cider
which
the
patriot
copiously
bestowed
on
coupiau
during
the
passage
of
the
little
troop
had
somewhat
dimmed
the
driver
s
perceptions
but
he
roused
himself
joyously
when
the
innkeeper
having
questioned
the
soldiers
came
back
to
the
inn
and
announced
that
the
blues
were
victorious
he
at
once
brought
out
the
coach
and
before
long
it
was
wending
its
way
across
the
valley
when
the
blues
reached
an
acclivity
on
the
road
from
which
the
plateau
of
la
pelerine
could
again
be
seen
in
the
distance
hulot
turned
round
to
discover
if
the
chouans
were
still
occupying
it
and
the
sun
glinting
on
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
showed
them
to
him
each
like
a
dazzling
spot
giving
a
last
glance
to
the
valley
of
la
pelerine
before
turning
into
that
of
ernee
he
thought
he
saw
coupiau
s
vehicle
on
the
road
he
had
just
traversed
isn
t
that
the
mayenne
coach
he
said
to
his
two
officers
they
looked
at
the
venerable
turgotine
and
easily
recognized
it
but
said
hulot
how
did
we
fail
to
meet
it
merle
and
gerard
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
another
enigma
cried
the
commandant
but
i
begin
to
see
the
meaning
of
it
at
the
same
moment
who
also
knew
the
turgotine
called
his
comrades
attention
to
it
and
the
general
shout
of
joy
which
they
sent
up
roused
the
young
lady
from
her
reflections
she
advanced
a
little
distance
and
saw
the
coach
which
was
beginning
the
ascent
of
la
pelerine
with
fatal
rapidity
the
luckless
vehicle
soon
reached
the
plateau
the
chouans
who
had
meantime
hidden
themselves
swooped
on
their
prey
with
hungry
celerity
the
silent
traveller
slipped
to
the
floor
of
the
carriage
bundling
himself
up
into
the
semblance
of
a
bale
well
done
cried
coupiau
from
his
wooden
perch
pointing
to
the
man
in
the
goatskin
you
must
have
scented
this
patriot
who
has
lots
of
gold
in
his
pouch
the
chouans
greeted
these
words
with
roars
of
laughter
crying
out
hey
amid
the
laughter
to
which
responded
like
an
echo
coupiau
came
down
from
his
seat
quite
crestfallen
when
the
famous
cibot
otherwise
called
helped
his
neighbor
to
get
out
of
the
coach
a
respectful
murmur
was
heard
among
the
chouans
it
is
the
abbe
gudin
cried
several
voices
at
this
respected
name
every
hat
was
off
and
the
men
knelt
down
before
the
priest
as
they
asked
his
blessing
which
he
gave
solemnly
here
could
trick
saint
peter
and
steal
the
keys
of
paradise
said
the
rector
slapping
that
worthy
on
the
shoulder
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
the
blues
would
have
intercepted
then
noticing
the
lady
the
abbe
went
to
speak
to
her
apart
who
had
meantime
briskly
opened
the
boot
of
the
cabriolet
held
up
to
his
comrades
with
savage
joy
a
bag
the
shape
of
which
betrayed
its
contents
to
be
rolls
of
coin
it
did
not
take
long
to
divide
the
booty
each
chouan
received
his
share
so
carefully
apportioned
that
the
division
was
made
without
the
slightest
dispute
then
went
to
the
lady
and
the
priest
and
offered
them
each
about
six
thousand
francs
can
i
conscientiously
accept
this
money
monsieur
gudin
said
the
lady
feeling
a
need
of
justification
why
not
madame
in
former
days
the
church
approved
of
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
protestants
and
there
s
far
more
reason
for
confiscating
that
of
these
revolutionists
who
deny
god
destroy
chapels
and
persecute
the
abbe
then
joined
example
to
precept
by
accepting
without
the
slightest
scruple
the
novel
sort
of
tithe
which
offered
to
him
besides
he
added
i
can
now
devote
all
i
possess
to
the
service
of
god
and
the
king
for
my
nephew
has
joined
the
blues
and
i
disinherit
coupiau
was
bemoaning
himself
and
declaring
that
he
was
ruined
join
us
said
and
you
shall
have
your
they
ll
say
i
let
the
coach
be
robbed
on
purpose
if
i
return
without
signs
of
oh
is
that
all
exclaimed
he
gave
a
signal
and
a
shower
of
bullets
riddled
the
turgotine
at
this
unexpected
volley
the
old
vehicle
gave
forth
such
a
lamentable
cry
that
the
chouans
superstitious
by
nature
recoiled
in
terror
but
caught
sight
of
the
pallid
face
of
the
silent
traveller
rising
from
the
floor
of
the
coach
you
ve
got
another
fowl
in
your
coop
he
said
in
a
low
voice
to
coupiau
yes
said
the
driver
but
i
make
it
a
condition
of
my
joining
you
that
i
be
allowed
to
take
that
worthy
man
safe
and
sound
to
fougeres
i
m
pledged
to
it
in
the
name
of
saint
anne
of
who
is
he
asked
that
i
can
t
tell
you
replied
coupiau
let
him
alone
said
shoving
with
his
elbow
he
has
vowed
by
saint
anne
of
auray
and
he
must
keep
his
very
good
said
addressing
coupiau
but
mind
you
don
t
go
down
the
mountain
too
fast
we
shall
overtake
you
a
good
reason
why
i
want
to
see
the
cut
of
your
traveller
and
give
him
his
just
then
the
gallop
of
a
horse
coming
rapidly
up
the
slopes
of
la
pelerine
was
heard
and
the
young
chief
presently
reappeared
the
lady
hastened
to
conceal
the
bag
of
plunder
which
she
held
in
her
hand
you
can
keep
that
money
without
any
scruple
said
the
young
man
touching
the
arm
which
the
lady
had
put
behind
her
here
is
a
letter
for
you
which
i
have
just
found
among
mine
which
were
waiting
for
me
at
la
vivetiere
it
is
from
your
then
looking
at
the
chouans
who
were
disappearing
into
the
woods
and
at
the
turgotine
which
was
now
on
its
way
to
the
valley
of
couesnon
he
added
after
all
my
haste
i
see
i
am
too
late
god
grant
i
am
deceived
in
my
suspicions
it
was
my
poor
mother
s
money
cried
the
lady
after
opening
her
letter
the
first
lines
of
which
drew
forth
her
exclamation
a
smothered
laugh
came
from
the
woods
and
the
young
man
himself
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
saw
the
lady
holding
in
her
hand
the
bag
containing
her
share
in
the
pillage
of
her
own
money
she
herself
began
to
laugh
well
well
marquis
god
be
praised
this
time
at
least
you
can
t
blame
me
she
said
smiling
levity
in
everything
even
your
remorse
said
the
young
man
she
colored
and
looked
at
the
marquis
with
so
genuine
a
contrition
that
he
was
softened
the
abbe
politely
returned
to
her
with
an
equivocal
manner
the
sum
he
had
received
then
he
followed
the
young
leader
who
took
the
through
which
he
had
come
before
following
them
the
lady
made
a
sign
to
who
came
to
her
advance
towards
mortagne
she
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
i
know
that
the
blues
are
constantly
sending
large
sums
of
money
in
coin
to
alencon
to
pay
for
their
supplies
of
war
if
i
allow
you
and
your
comrades
to
keep
what
you
captured
it
is
only
on
condition
that
you
repay
it
later
but
be
careful
that
the
gars
knows
nothing
of
the
object
of
the
expedition
he
would
certainly
oppose
it
in
case
of
i
will
pacify
madame
said
the
marquis
after
she
had
rejoined
him
and
had
mounted
his
horse
giving
her
own
to
the
abbe
my
friends
in
paris
write
me
to
be
very
careful
of
what
we
do
the
republic
they
say
is
preparing
to
fight
us
with
spies
and
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
plan
she
replied
they
have
clever
ideas
those
fellows
i
could
take
part
in
that
sort
of
war
and
find
i
don
t
doubt
it
cried
the
marquis
pichegru
advises
me
to
be
cautious
and
watchful
in
my
friendships
and
relations
of
every
kind
the
republic
does
me
the
honor
to
think
me
more
dangerous
than
all
the
vendeans
put
together
and
counts
on
certain
of
my
weaknesses
to
lay
hands
upon
surely
you
will
not
distrust
me
she
said
striking
his
heart
with
the
hand
by
which
she
held
to
him
are
you
a
traitor
madame
he
said
bending
towards
her
his
forehead
which
she
kissed
in
that
case
said
the
abbe
referring
to
the
news
fouche
s
police
will
be
more
dangerous
for
us
than
their
battalions
of
recruits
and
yes
true
enough
father
replied
the
marquis
ah
ah
cried
the
lady
fouche
means
to
send
women
against
you
does
he
i
shall
be
ready
for
them
she
added
in
a
deeper
tone
of
voice
and
after
a
slight
pause
at
a
distance
of
three
or
four
gunshots
from
the
plateau
now
abandoned
a
little
scene
was
taking
place
which
was
not
uncommon
in
those
days
on
the
after
leaving
the
little
village
of
la
pelerine
and
again
stopped
the
turgotine
at
a
dip
in
the
road
coupiau
got
off
his
seat
after
making
a
faint
resistance
the
silent
traveller
extracted
from
his
hiding
place
by
the
two
chouans
found
himself
on
his
knees
in
a
furze
bush
who
are
you
asked
in
a
threatening
voice
the
traveller
kept
silence
until
put
the
question
again
and
enforced
it
with
the
butt
end
of
his
gun
i
am
jacques
pinaud
he
replied
with
a
glance
at
coupiau
a
poor
coupiau
made
a
sign
in
the
negative
not
considering
it
an
infraction
of
his
promise
to
saint
anne
the
sign
enlightened
who
took
aim
at
the
luckless
traveller
while
laid
before
him
categorically
a
terrible
ultimatum
you
are
too
fat
to
be
poor
if
you
make
me
ask
you
your
name
again
here
s
my
friend
who
will
obtain
the
gratitude
and
of
your
heirs
in
a
second
who
are
you
he
added
after
a
pause
i
am
d
orgemont
of
ah
ah
cried
the
two
chouans
i
didn
t
tell
your
name
monsieur
d
orgemont
said
coupiau
the
holy
virgin
is
my
witness
that
i
did
my
best
to
protect
inasmuch
as
you
are
monsieur
d
orgemont
of
fougeres
said
with
an
air
of
ironical
respect
we
shall
let
you
go
in
peace
only
as
you
are
neither
a
good
chouan
nor
a
true
blue
thought
it
was
you
who
bought
the
property
of
the
abbey
de
juvigny
you
will
pay
us
three
hundred
crowns
of
six
francs
each
for
your
ransom
neutrality
is
worth
that
at
three
hundred
crowns
of
six
francs
each
chorussed
the
luckless
banker
and
coupiau
in
three
different
tones
alas
my
good
friend
continued
d
orgemont
i
m
a
ruined
man
the
last
forced
loan
of
that
devilish
republic
for
a
hundred
millions
sucked
me
dry
taxed
as
i
was
how
much
did
your
republic
get
out
of
you
a
thousand
crowns
my
dear
man
replied
the
banker
with
a
piteous
air
hoping
for
a
reduction
if
your
republic
gets
forced
loans
out
of
you
for
such
big
sums
as
that
you
must
see
that
you
would
do
better
with
us
our
government
would
cost
you
less
three
hundred
crowns
do
you
call
that
dear
for
your
skin
where
am
i
to
get
them
out
of
your
said
and
mind
that
the
money
is
forthcoming
or
we
ll
singe
you
how
am
i
to
pay
it
to
you
asked
d

your

not
far
from
gibarry
s
farm
where
my
cousin
otherwise
called
cibot
lives

can
pay

money
to
him
said
that
s
not
said
d
orgemont
what
do
we
care
for
that
said
but
mind
you
remember
that
if
that
money
is
not
paid
to
within
two
weeks
we
shall
pay
you
a
little
visit
which
will
cure
your
gout
as
for

coupiau
added
your
name
in
future
is
to
be
so
saying
the
two
chouans
departed
the
traveller
returned
to
the
vehicle
which
thanks
to
coupiau
s
whip
now
made
rapid
progress
to
fougeres
if
you
d
only
been
armed
said
coupiau
we
might
have
made
some
idiot
cried
d
orgemont
pointing
to
his
heavy
shoes
i
have
ten
thousand
francs
in
those
soles
do
you
think
i
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
fight
with
that
sum
about
me
scratched
his
ear
and
looked
behind
him
but
his
new
comrades
were
out
of
sight
hulot
and
his
command
stopped
at
ernee
long
enough
to
place
the
wounded
in
the
hospital
of
the
little
town
and
then
without
further
hindrance
they
reached
mayenne
there
the
commandant
cleared
up
his
doubts
as
to
the
action
of
the
chouans
for
on
the
following
day
the
news
of
the
pillage
of
the
turgotine
was
received
a
few
days
later
the
government
despatched
to
mayenne
so
strong
a
force
of
patriotic
conscripts
that
hulot
was
able
to
fill
the
ranks
of
his
brigade
disquieting
rumors
began
to
circulate
about
the
insurrection
a
rising
had
taken
place
at
all
the
points
where
during
the
late
war
the
chouans
and
bretons
had
made
their
chief
centres
of
insurrection
the
little
town
of
between
pontorson
and
fougeres
was
occupied
by
them
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
for
the
time
being
a
headquarters
of
operations
and
supplies
from
there
they
were
able
to
communicate
with
normandy
and
the
morbihan
without
risk
their
subaltern
leaders
roamed
the
three
provinces
roused
all
the
partisans
of
monarchy
and
gave
consistence
and
unity
to
their
plans
these
proceedings
coincided
with
what
was
going
on
in
la
vendee
where
the
same
intrigues
under
the
influence
of
four
famous
leaders
the
abbe
vernal
the
comte
de
fontaine
de
chatillon
and
suzannet
were
agitating
the
country
the
chevalier
de
valois
the
marquis
d
esgrignon
and
the
troisvilles
were
it
was
said
corresponding
with
these
leaders
in
the
department
of
the
orne
the
chief
of
the
great
plan
of
operations
which
was
thus
developing
slowly
but
in
formidable
proportions
was
really
the
gars
a
name
given
by
the
chouans
to
the
marquis
de
montauran
on
his
arrival
from
england
the
information
sent
to
hulot
by
the
war
department
proved
correct
in
all
particulars
the
marquis
gained
after
a
time
sufficient
ascendancy
over
the
chouans
to
make
them
understand
the
true
object
of
the
war
and
to
persuade
them
that
the
excesses
of
which
they
were
guilty
brought
disgrace
upon
the
cause
they
had
adopted
the
daring
nature
the
nerve
coolness
and
capacity
of
this
young
nobleman
awakened
the
hopes
of
all
the
enemies
of
the
republic
and
suited
so
thoroughly
the
grave
and
even
solemn
enthusiasm
of
those
regions
that
even
the
least
zealous
partisans
of
the
king
did
their
part
in
preparing
a
decisive
blow
in
behalf
of
the
defeated
monarchy
hulot
received
no
answer
to
the
questions
and
the
frequent
reports
which
he
addressed
to
the
government
in
paris
but
the
news
of
the
almost
magical
return
of
general
bonaparte
and
the
events
of
the
brumaire
were
soon
current
in
the
air
the
military
commanders
of
the
west
understood
then
the
silence
of
the
ministers
nevertheless
they
were
only
the
more
impatient
to
be
released
from
the
responsibility
that
weighed
upon
them
and
they
were
in
every
way
desirous
of
knowing
what
measures
the
new
government
was
likely
to
take
when
it
was
known
to
these
soldiers
that
general
bonaparte
was
appointed
first
consul
of
the
republic
their
joy
was
great
they
saw
for
the
first
time
one
of
their
own
profession
called
to
the
management
of
the
nation
france
which
had
made
an
idol
of
this
young
hero
quivered
with
hope
the
vigor
and
energy
of
the
nation
revived
paris
weary
of
its
long
gloom
gave
itself
up
to
fetes
and
pleasures
of
which
it
had
been
so
long
deprived
the
first
acts
of
the
consulate
did
not
diminish
any
hopes
and
liberty
felt
no
alarm
the
first
consul
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
west
the
eloquent
allocutions
addressed
to
the
masses
which
bonaparte
had
as
it
were
invented
produced
effects
in
those
days
of
patriotism
and
miracle
that
were
absolutely
startling
his
voice
echoed
through
the
world
like
the
voice
of
a
prophet
for
none
of
his
proclamations
had
as
yet
been
belied
by
defeat
inhabitants
an
impious
war
again
inflames
the
west
the
makers
of
these
troubles
are
traitors
sold
to
the
english
or
brigands
who
seek
in
civil
war
opportunity
and
license
for
misdeeds
to
such
men
the
government
owes
no
forbearance
nor
any
declaration
of
its
principles
but
there
are
citizens
dear
to
france
who
have
been
misled
by
their
wiles
it
is
so
such
that
truth
and
light
are
due
unjust
laws
have
been
promulgated
and
executed
arbitrary
acts
have
threatened
the
safety
of
citizens
and
the
liberty
of
consciences
mistaken
entries
on
the
list
of
imperil
citizens
the
great
principles
of
social
order
have
been
violated
the
consuls
declare
that
liberty
of
worship
having
been
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
the
law
of
prairial
year
which
gives
the
use
of
edifices
built
for
religious
worship
to
all
citizens
shall
be
executed
the
government
will
pardon
it
will
be
merciful
to
repentance
its
mercy
will
be
complete
and
absolute
but
it
will
punish
whosoever
after
this
declaration
shall
dare
to
resist
the
national
sovereignty
well
said
hulot
after
the
public
reading
of
this
consular
manifesto
isn
t
that
paternal
enough
but
you
ll
see
that
not
a
single
royalist
brigand
will
be
changed
by
the
commandant
was
right
the
proclamation
merely
served
to
strengthen
each
side
in
their
own
convictions
a
few
days
later
hulot
and
his
colleagues
received
reinforcements
the
new
minister
of
war
notified
them
that
general
brune
was
appointed
to
command
the
troops
in
the
west
of
france
hulot
whose
experience
was
known
to
the
government
had
provisional
control
in
the
departments
of
the
orne
and
mayenne
an
unusual
activity
began
to
show
itself
in
the
government
offices
circulars
from
the
minister
of
war
and
the
minister
of
police
gave
notice
that
vigorous
measures
entrusted
to
the
military
commanders
would
be
taken
to
stifle
the
insurrection
at
its
birth
but
the
chouans
and
the
vendeans
had
profited
by
the
inaction
of
the
directory
to
rouse
the
whole
region
and
virtually
take
possession
of
it
a
new
consular
proclamation
was
therefore
issued
this
time
it
was
the
general
speaking
to
his
troops
soldiers
there
are
none
but
brigands
and
hirelings
of
england
now
remaining
in
the
west
the
army
is
composed
of
more
than
fifty
thousand
brave
men
let
me
speedily
hear
from
them
that
the
rebel
chiefs
have
ceased
to
live
glory
is
won
by
toil
alone
if
it
could
be
had
by
living
in
barracks
in
a
town
all
would
have
it
soldiers
whatever
be
the
rank
you
hold
in
the
army
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
awaits
you
to
be
worthy
of
it
you
must
brave
the
inclemencies
of
weather
ice
snow
and
the
excessive
coldness
of
the
nights
you
must
surprise
your
enemies
at
daybreak
and
exterminate
those
wretches
the
disgrace
of
france
make
a
short
and
sure
campaign
be
inexorable
to
those
brigands
and
maintain
strict
discipline
national
guards
join
the
strength
of
your
arms
to
that
of
the
line
if
you
know
among
you
any
men
who
fraternize
with
the
brigands
arrest
them
let
them
find
no
refuge
pursue
them
if
traitors
dare
to
harbor
and
defend
them
let
them
perish
together
what
a
man
cried
hulot
it
is
just
as
it
was
in
the
army
of
italy
he
rings
in
the
mass
and
he
says
it
himself
don
t
you
call
that
talking
hey
yes
but
he
speaks
by
himself
and
in
his
own
name
said
gerard
who
began
to
feel
alarmed
at
the
possible
results
of
the
brumaire
and
where
s
the
harm
since
he
s
a
soldier
said
merle
a
group
of
soldiers
were
clustered
at
a
little
distance
before
the
same
proclamation
posted
on
a
wall
as
none
of
them
could
read
they
gazed
at
it
some
with
a
careless
eye
others
with
curiosity
while
two
or
three
hunted
about
for
a
citizen
who
looked
learned
enough
to
read
it
to
them
now
you
tell
us
what
that
rag
of
a
paper
says
cried
in
a
saucy
tone
to
his
comrade
easy
to
guess
replied
at
these
words
the
other
men
clustered
round
the
pair
who
were
always
ready
to
play
their
parts
look
there
continued
pointing
to
a
coarse
woodcut
which
headed
the
proclamation
and
represented
a
pair
of
compasses
which
had
lately
superseded
the
level
of
it
means
that
the
troops
that
s
us
are
to
march
firm
don
t
you
see
the
compasses
are
open
both
legs
apart
that
s
an
such
much
for
your
learning
my
lad
it
isn
t
an
emblem
it
s
called
a
problem
i
ve
served
in
the
artillery
continued
and
problems
were
meat
and
drink
to
my
i
say
it
s
an
it
s
a
what
will
you
bet
your
german
pipe
done
by
your
leave
adjutant
isn
t
that
thing
an
emblem
and
not
a
problem
said
following
gerard
who
was
thoughtfully
walking
away
it
is
both
he
replied
gravely
the
adjutant
was
making
fun
of
you
said
that
paper
means
that
our
general
in
italy
is
promoted
consul
which
is
a
fine
grade
and
we
are
to
get
shoes
and
ii
one
of
fouche
s
ideas
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
brumaire
just
as
hulot
was
exercising
his
brigade
now
by
order
of
his
superiors
wholly
concentrated
at
mayenne
a
courier
arrived
from
alencon
with
despatches
at
the
reading
of
which
his
face
betrayed
extreme
annoyance
forward
then
he
cried
in
an
angry
tone
sticking
the
papers
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
two
companies
will
march
with
me
towards
mortagne
the
chouans
are
there
you
will
accompany
me
he
said
to
merle
and
gerard
may
be
i
created
a
nobleman
if
i
can
understand
one
word
of
that
despatch
perhaps
i
m
a
fool
well
anyhow
forward
march
there
s
no
time
to
commandant
by
your
leave
said
merle
kicking
the
cover
of
the
ministerial
despatch
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
what
is
there
so
exasperating
in
that
god
s
thunder
nothing
at
all
except
that
we
are
when
the
commandant
gave
vent
to
this
military
oath
an
object
it
must
be
said
of
republican
atheistical
remonstrance
it
gave
warning
of
a
storm
the
diverse
intonations
of
the
words
were
degrees
of
a
thermometer
by
which
the
brigade
could
judge
of
the
patience
of
its
commander
the
old
soldier
s
frankness
of
nature
had
made
this
knowledge
so
easy
that
the
veriest
little
knew
his
hulot
by
heart
simply
by
observing
the
variations
of
the
grimace
with
which
the
commander
screwed
up
his
cheek
and
snapped
his
eyes
and
vented
his
oath
on
this
occasion
the
tone
of
smothered
rage
with
which
he
uttered
the
words
made
his
two
friends
silent
and
circumspect
even
the
pits
of
the
which
dented
that
veteran
face
seemed
deeper
and
the
skin
itself
browner
than
usual
his
broad
queue
braided
at
the
edges
had
fallen
upon
one
of
his
epaulettes
as
he
replaced
his
hat
and
he
flung
it
back
with
such
fury
that
the
ends
became
untied
however
as
he
stood
his
hands
clenched
his
arms
crossed
tightly
over
his
breast
his
mustache
bristling
gerard
ventured
to
ask
him
presently
are
we
to
start
at
once
yes
if
the
men
have
they
shoulder
arms
left
wheel
forward
march
cried
gerard
at
a
sign
from
the
commandant
the
marched
at
the
head
of
the
two
companies
designated
by
gerard
at
the
first
roll
of
the
drums
the
commandant
who
still
stood
plunged
in
thought
seemed
to
rouse
himself
and
he
left
the
town
accompanied
by
his
two
officers
to
whom
he
said
not
a
word
merle
and
gerard
looked
at
each
other
silently
as
if
to
ask
how
long
is
he
going
to
keep
us
in
suspense
and
as
they
marched
they
cautiously
kept
an
observing
eye
on
their
leader
who
continued
to
vent
rambling
words
between
his
teeth
several
times
these
vague
phrases
sounded
like
oaths
in
the
ears
of
his
soldiers
but
not
one
of
them
dared
to
utter
a
word
for
they
all
when
occasion
demanded
maintained
the
stern
discipline
to
which
the
veterans
who
had
served
under
bonaparte
in
italy
were
accustomed
the
greater
part
of
them
had
belonged
like
hulot
to
the
famous
battalions
which
capitulated
at
mayenne
under
a
promise
not
to
serve
again
on
the
frontier
and
the
army
called
them
les
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
leaders
and
men
who
more
thoroughly
understood
each
other
at
dawn
of
the
day
after
their
departure
hulot
and
his
troop
were
on
the
to
alencon
about
three
miles
from
that
town
towards
mortagne
at
a
part
of
the
road
which
leads
through
pastures
watered
by
the
sarthe
a
picturesque
vista
of
these
meadows
lay
to
the
left
while
the
woodlands
on
the
right
which
flank
the
road
and
join
the
great
forest
of
serve
as
a
foil
to
the
delightful
aspect
of
the
the
narrow
causeway
is
bordered
on
each
side
by
ditches
the
soil
of
which
being
constantly
thrown
out
upon
the
fields
has
formed
high
banks
covered
with
furze
the
name
given
throughout
the
west
to
this
prickly
gorse
this
shrub
which
spreads
itself
in
thorny
masses
makes
excellent
fodder
in
winter
for
horses
and
cattle
but
as
long
as
it
was
not
cut
the
chouans
hid
themselves
behind
its
breastwork
of
dull
green
these
banks
bristling
with
gorse
signifying
to
travellers
their
approach
to
brittany
made
this
part
of
the
road
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
as
dangerous
as
it
was
beautiful
it
was
these
dangers
which
compelled
the
hasty
departure
of
hulot
and
his
soldiers
and
it
was
here
that
he
at
last
let
out
the
secret
of
his
wrath
he
was
now
on
his
return
escorting
an
old
drawn
by
which
the
weariness
of
his
soldiers
after
their
forced
march
was
compelling
to
advance
at
a
snail
s
pace
the
company
of
blues
from
the
garrison
at
mortagne
who
had
escorted
the
rickety
vehicle
to
the
limits
of
their
district
where
hulot
and
his
men
had
met
them
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
on
their
way
back
to
their
quarters
like
so
many
black
specks
one
of
hulot
s
companies
was
in
the
rear
the
other
in
advance
of
the
carriage
the
commandant
who
was
marching
with
merle
and
gerard
between
the
advance
guard
and
the
carriage
suddenly
growled
out
ten
thousand
thunders
would
you
believe
that
the
general
detached
us
from
mayenne
to
escort
two
petticoats
but
commandant
remarked
gerard
when
we
came
up
just
now
and
took
charge
i
observed
that
you
bowed
to
them
not
ha
that
s
the
infamy
of
it
those
dandies
in
paris
ordered
the
greatest
attention
paid
to
their
damned
females
how
dare
they
dishonor
good
and
brave
patriots
by
trailing
us
after
petticoats
as
for
me
i
march
straight
and
i
don
t
choose
to
have
to
do
with
other
people
s
zigzags
when
i
saw
danton
taking
mistresses
and
barras
too
i
said
to
them
citizens
when
the
republic
called
you
to
govern
it
was
not
that
you
might
authorize
the
vices
of
the
old
regime
you
may
tell
me
that
women
oh
yes
we
must
have
women
that
s
all
right
good
soldiers
of
course
must
have
women
and
good
women
but
in
times
of
danger
no
besides
where
would
be
the
good
of
sweeping
away
the
old
abuses
if
patriots
bring
them
back
again
look
at
the
first
consul
there
s
a
man
no
women
for
him
always
about
his
business
i
d
bet
my
left
mustache
that
he
doesn
t
know
the
fool
s
errand
we
ve
been
sent
on
but
commandant
said
merle
laughing
i
have
seen
the
of
the
nose
of
the
young
lady
and
i
ll
declare
the
whole
world
needn
t
be
ashamed
to
feel
an
itch
as
i
do
to
revolve
round
that
carriage
and
get
up
a
bit
of
a
look
out
merle
said
gerard
the
veiled
beauties
have
a
man
accompanying
them
who
seems
wily
enough
to
catch
you
in
a
who
that
whose
little
eyes
are
ferretting
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
as
if
he
saw
chouans
the
fellow
seems
to
have
no
legs
the
moment
his
horse
is
hidden
by
the
carriage
he
looks
like
a
duck
with
its
head
sticking
out
of
a
pate
if
that
booby
can
hinder
me
from
kissing
the
pretty
linnet
duck
linnet
oh
my
poor
merle
you
have
taken
wings
indeed
but
don
t
trust
the
duck
his
green
eyes
are
as
treacherous
as
the
eyes
of
a
snake
and
as
sly
as
those
of
a
woman
who
forgives
her
husband
i
distrust
the
chouans
much
less
than
i
do
those
lawyers
whose
faces
are
like
bottles
of
pooh
cried
merle
gaily
i
ll
risk
it
with
the
commandant
s
permission
that
woman
has
eyes
like
stars
and
it
s
worth
playing
any
stakes
to
see
caught
poor
fellow
said
gerard
to
the
commandant
he
is
beginning
to
talk
nonsense
hulot
made
a
face
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
before
he
swallows
the
soup
i
advise
him
to
smell
bravo
merle
said
gerard
judging
by
his
friend
s
lagging
step
that
he
meant
to
let
the
carriage
overtake
him
isn
t
he
a
happy
fellow
he
is
the
only
man
i
know
who
can
laugh
over
the
death
of
a
comrade
without
being
thought
he
s
the
true
french
soldier
said
hulot
in
a
grave
tone
just
look
at
him
pulling
his
epaulets
back
to
his
shoulders
to
show
he
is
a
captain
cried
gerard
laughing
as
if
his
rank
mattered
the
coach
toward
which
the
officer
was
pivoting
did
in
fact
contain
two
women
one
of
whom
seemed
to
be
the
servant
of
the
other
such
women
always
run
in
couples
said
hulot
a
lean
and
little
man
ambled
his
horse
sometimes
before
sometimes
behind
the
carriage
but
though
he
was
evidently
accompanying
these
privileged
women
no
one
had
yet
seen
him
speak
to
them
this
silence
a
proof
either
of
respect
or
contempt
as
the
case
might
be
the
quantity
of
baggage
belonging
to
the
lady
whom
the
commandant
sneeringly
called
the
princess
everything
even
to
the
clothes
of
her
attendant
squire
stirred
hulot
s
bile
the
dress
of
the
unknown
man
was
a
good
specimen
of
the
fashions
of
the
day
then
being
caricatured
as
incroyable
unbelievable
unless
seen
imagine
a
person
trussed
up
in
a
coat
the
front
of
which
was
so
short
that
five
or
six
inches
of
the
waistcoat
came
below
it
while
the
skirts
were
so
long
that
they
hung
down
behind
like
the
tail
of
a
cod
the
term
then
used
to
describe
them
an
enormous
cravat
was
wound
about
his
neck
in
so
many
folds
that
the
little
head
which
protruded
from
that
muslin
labyrinth
certainly
did
justify
captain
merle
s
comparison
the
stranger
also
wore
trousers
and
suwaroff
boots
a
huge
cameo
pinned
his
shirt
two
hung
from
his
belt
his
hair
worn
in
ringlets
on
each
side
of
his
face
concealed
nearly
the
whole
forehead
and
for
a
last
adornment
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
that
of
his
coat
came
so
high
that
his
head
seemed
enveloped
like
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
a
horn
of
paper
add
to
these
queer
accessories
which
were
combined
in
utter
want
of
harmony
the
burlesque
contradictions
in
color
of
yellow
trousers
scarlet
waistcoat
cinnamon
coat
and
a
correct
idea
will
be
gained
of
the
supreme
good
taste
which
all
dandies
blindly
obeyed
in
the
first
years
of
the
consulate
this
costume
utterly
uncouth
seemed
to
have
been
invented
as
a
final
test
of
grace
and
to
show
that
there
was
nothing
too
ridiculous
for
fashion
to
consecrate
the
rider
seemed
to
be
about
thirty
years
old
but
he
was
really
perhaps
he
owed
this
appearance
of
age
to
debauchery
possibly
to
the
perils
of
the
period
in
spite
of
his
preposterous
dress
he
had
a
certain
elegance
of
manner
which
proved
him
to
be
a
man
of
some
breeding
when
the
captain
had
dropped
back
close
to
the
carriage
the
dandy
seemed
to
fathom
his
design
and
favored
it
by
checking
his
horse
merle
who
had
flung
him
a
sardonic
glance
encountered
one
of
those
impenetrable
faces
trained
by
the
vicissitudes
of
the
revolution
to
hide
all
even
the
most
insignificant
emotion
the
moment
the
curved
end
of
the
old
triangular
hat
and
the
captain
s
epaulets
were
seen
by
the
occupants
of
the
carriage
a
voice
of
angelic
sweetness
said
monsieur
l
officier
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
tell
us
at
what
part
of
the
road
we
now
are
there
is
some
inexpressible
charm
in
the
question
of
an
unknown
traveller
if
a
woman
a
world
of
adventure
is
in
every
word
but
if
the
woman
asks
for
assistance
or
information
proving
her
weakness
or
ignorance
of
certain
things
every
man
is
inclined
to
construct
some
impossible
tale
which
shall
lead
to
his
happiness
the
words
monsieur
l
officier
and
the
polite
tone
of
the
question
stirred
the
captain
s
heart
in
a
manner
hitherto
unknown
to
him
he
tried
to
examine
the
lady
but
was
cruelly
disappointed
for
a
jealous
veil
concealed
her
features
he
could
barely
see
her
eyes
which
shone
through
the
gauze
like
onyx
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
you
are
now
three
miles
from
alencon
madame
he
replied
alencon
already
and
the
lady
threw
herself
or
rather
she
gently
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
and
said
no
more
alencon
said
the
other
woman
apparently
waking
up
then
you
ll
see
it
she
caught
sight
of
the
captain
and
was
silent
merle
disappointed
in
his
hope
of
seeing
the
face
of
the
beautiful
incognita
began
to
examine
that
of
her
companion
she
was
a
girl
about
years
of
age
fair
with
a
pretty
figure
and
the
sort
of
complexion
fresh
and
white
and
which
characterizes
the
women
of
valognes
bayeux
and
the
environs
of
alencon
her
blue
eyes
showed
no
great
intelligence
but
a
certain
firmness
mingled
with
tender
feeling
she
wore
a
gown
of
some
common
woollen
stuff
the
fashion
of
her
hair
done
up
closely
under
a
norman
cap
without
any
pretension
gave
a
charming
simplicity
to
her
face
her
attitude
without
of
course
having
any
of
the
conventional
nobility
of
society
was
not
without
the
natural
dignity
of
a
modest
young
girl
who
can
look
back
upon
her
past
life
without
a
single
cause
for
repentance
merle
knew
her
at
a
glance
for
one
of
those
wild
flowers
which
are
sometimes
taken
from
their
native
fields
to
parisian
where
so
many
blasting
rays
are
concentrated
without
ever
losing
the
purity
of
their
color
or
their
rustic
simplicity
the
naive
attitude
of
the
girl
and
her
modest
glance
showed
merle
very
plainly
that
she
did
not
wish
a
listener
in
fact
no
sooner
had
he
withdrawn
than
the
two
women
began
a
conversation
in
so
low
a
tone
that
only
a
murmur
of
it
reached
his
ear
you
came
away
in
such
a
hurry
said
the
that
you
hardly
took
time
to
dress
a
sight
you
are
now
if
we
are
going
beyond
alencon
you
must
really
make
your
oh
oh
francine
cried
the
lady
what
is
it
this
is
the
third
time
you
have
tried
to
make
me
tell
you
the
reasons
for
this
journey
and
where
we
are
have
i
said
one
single
word
which
deserves
that
reproach
oh
i
ve
noticed
your
manoeuvring
simple
and
truthful
as
you
are
you
have
learned
a
little
cunning
from
me
you
are
beginning
to
hold
questioning
in
horror
and
right
enough
too
for
of
all
the
known
ways
of
getting
at
a
secret
questions
are
to
my
mind
the
well
said
francine
since
nothing
escapes
you
you
must
admit
marie
that
your
conduct
would
excite
the
curiosity
of
a
saint
yesterday
without
a
penny
your
hands
are
full
of
gold
at
mortagne
they
give
you
the
which
was
pillaged
and
the
driver
killed
with
government
troops
to
protect
you
and
you
are
followed
by
a
man
whom
i
regard
as
your
evil
who
corentin
said
the
young
lady
accenting
the
words
by
two
inflections
of
her
voice
expressive
of
contempt
a
sentiment
which
appeared
in
the
gesture
with
which
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
rider
listen
francine
she
said
do
you
remember
patriot
the
monkey
i
taught
to
imitate
danton
yes
well
were
you
afraid
of
him
he
was
and
corentin
is
muzzled
my
we
used
to
play
with
patriot
by
the
hour
said
francine
i
know
that
but
he
always
ended
by
serving
us
some
bad
so
saying
francine
threw
herself
hastily
back
close
to
her
mistress
whose
hands
she
caught
and
kissed
in
a
coaxing
way
saying
in
a
tone
of
deep
affection
you
know
what
i
mean
marie
but
you
will
not
answer
me
how
can
you
after
all
that
sadness
which
did
so
grieve
me
oh
indeed
it
grieved
me
how
can
you
in
hours
change
about
and
become
so
gay
you
who
talked
of
suicide
why
have
you
changed
i
have
a
right
to
ask
these
questions
of
your
soul
it
is
mine
my
claim
to
it
is
before
that
of
others
for
you
will
never
be
better
loved
than
you
are
by
me
speak
why
francine
don
t
you
see
all
around
you
the
secret
of
my
good
spirits
look
at
the
yellowing
tufts
of
those
distant
not
one
is
like
another
as
we
look
at
them
from
this
distance
don
t
they
seem
like
an
old
bit
of
tapestry
see
the
hedges
from
behind
which
the
chouans
may
spring
upon
us
at
any
moment
when
i
look
at
that
gorse
i
fancy
i
can
see
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
every
time
the
road
is
shady
under
the
trees
i
fancy
i
shall
hear
firing
and
then
my
heart
beats
and
a
new
sensation
comes
over
me
it
is
neither
the
shuddering
of
fear
nor
an
emotion
of
pleasure
no
it
is
better
than
either
it
is
the
stirring
of
everything
within
me
it
is
life
why
shouldn
t
i
be
gay
when
a
little
excitement
is
dropped
into
my
monotonous
existence
ah
you
are
telling
me
nothing
cruel
girl
holy
virgin
added
francine
raising
her
eyes
in
distress
to
heaven
to
whom
will
she
confess
herself
if
she
denies
the
truth
to
me
francine
said
the
lady
in
a
grave
tone
i
can
t
explain
to
you
my
present
enterprise
it
is
why
do
wrong
when
you
know
it
to
be
wrong
how
can
i
help
it
i
catch
myself
thinking
as
if
i
were
fifty
and
acting
as
if
i
were
still
fifteen
you
have
always
been
my
better
self
my
poor
francine
but
in
this
affair
i
must
stifle
conscience
and
she
added
after
a
pause
i
can
not
therefore
how
can
you
expect
me
to
take
a
confessor
as
stern
as
you
and
she
patted
the
girl
s
hand
when
did
i
ever
blame
your
actions
cried
francine
evil
is
so
mixed
with
good
in
your
nature
yes
saint
anne
of
auray
to
whom
i
pray
to
save
you
will
absolve
you
for
all
you
do
and
marie
am
i
not
here
beside
you
without
so
much
as
knowing
where
you
go
and
she
kissed
her
hands
with
effusion
but
replied
marie
you
may
yet
desert
me
if
your
conscience
hush
hush
mademoiselle
cried
francine
with
a
hurt
expression
but
surely
you
will
tell
me
nothing
said
the
young
lady
in
a
resolute
voice
only
and
i
wish
you
to
know
it
i
hate
this
enterprise
even
more
than
i
hate
him
whose
gilded
tongue
induced
me
to
undertake
it
i
will
be
rank
and
own
to
you
that
i
would
never
have
yielded
to
their
wishes
if
i
had
not
foreseen
in
this
ignoble
farce
a
mingling
of
love
and
danger
which
tempted
me
i
can
not
bear
to
leave
this
empty
world
without
at
least
attempting
to
gather
the
flowers
that
it
owes
me
whether
i
perish
in
the
attempt
or
not
but
remember
for
the
honor
of
my
memory
that
had
i
ever
been
a
happy
woman
the
sight
of
their
great
knife
ready
to
fall
upon
my
neck
would
not
have
driven
me
to
accept
a
part
in
this
tragedy
for
it
is
a
tragedy
but
now
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
if
it
were
countermanded
i
should
instantly
fling
myself
into
the
sarthe
it
would
not
be
destroying
life
for
i
have
never
oh
saint
anne
of
auray
forgive
her
what
are
you
so
afraid
of
you
know
very
well
that
the
dull
round
of
domestic
life
gives
no
opportunity
for
my
passions
that
would
be
bad
in
most
women
i
admit
but
my
soul
is
made
of
a
higher
sensibility
and
can
bear
great
tests
i
might
have
been
perhaps
a
gentle
being
like
you
why
why
have
i
risen
above
or
sunk
beneath
the
level
of
my
sex
ah
the
wife
of
bonaparte
is
a
happy
woman
yes
i
shall
die
young
for
i
am
gay
as
you
say
gay
at
this
where
there
is
blood
to
drink
as
that
poor
danton
used
to
say
there
there
forget
what
i
am
saying
it
is
the
woman
of
fifty
who
speaks
thank
god
the
girl
of
fifteen
is
still
within
the
young
shuddered
she
alone
knew
the
fiery
impetuous
nature
of
her
mistress
she
alone
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
a
soul
rich
with
enthusiasm
into
the
secret
emotions
of
a
being
who
up
to
this
time
had
seen
life
pass
her
like
a
shadow
she
could
not
grasp
eager
as
she
was
to
do
so
after
sowing
broadcast
with
full
hands
and
harvesting
nothing
this
woman
was
still
virgin
in
soul
but
irritated
by
a
multitude
of
baffled
desires
weary
of
a
struggle
without
an
adversary
she
had
reached
in
her
despair
to
the
point
of
preferring
good
to
evil
if
it
came
in
the
form
of
enjoyment
evil
to
good
if
it
offered
her
some
poetic
emotion
misery
to
mediocrity
as
something
nobler
and
higher
the
gloomy
and
mysterious
future
of
present
death
to
a
life
without
hopes
or
even
without
sufferings
never
in
any
heart
was
so
much
powder
heaped
ready
for
the
spark
never
were
so
many
riches
for
love
to
feed
on
no
daughter
of
eve
was
ever
moulded
with
a
greater
mixture
of
gold
in
her
clay
francine
like
an
angel
of
earth
watched
over
this
being
whose
perfections
she
adored
believing
that
she
obeyed
a
celestial
mandate
in
striving
to
bring
that
spirit
back
among
the
choir
of
seraphim
whence
it
was
banished
for
the
sin
of
pride
there
is
the
of
alencon
said
the
horseman
riding
up
to
the
carriage
i
see
it
replied
the
young
lady
in
a
cold
tone
ah
well
he
said
turning
away
with
all
the
signs
of
servile
submission
in
spite
of
his
disappointment
go
faster
said
the
lady
to
the
postilion
there
is
no
longer
any
danger
go
at
a
fast
trot
or
even
a
gallop
if
you
can
we
are
almost
into
as
the
carriage
passed
the
commandant
she
called
out
to
him
in
a
sweet
voice
we
will
meet
at
the
inn
commandant
come
and
see
yes
yes
growled
the
commandant
the
inn
come
and
see
me
is
that
how
you
speak
to
an
officer
in
command
of
the
army
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
carriage
which
was
now
rolling
rapidly
along
the
road
don
t
be
vexed
commandant
she
has
got
your
rank
as
general
up
her
sleeve
said
corentin
laughing
as
he
endeavored
to
put
his
horse
into
a
gallop
to
overtake
the
carriage
i
sha
n
t
let
myself
be
fooled
by
any
such
folks
as
they
said
hulot
to
his
two
friends
in
a
growling
tone
i
d
rather
throw
my
general
s
coat
into
that
ditch
than
earn
it
out
of
a
bed
what
are
these
birds
after
have
you
any
idea
either
of
you
yes
said
merle
i
ve
an
idea
that
that
s
the
handsomest
women
i
ever
saw
i
think
you
re
reading
the
riddle
all
wrong
perhaps
she
s
the
wife
of
the
first
pooh
the
first
consul
s
wife
is
old
and
this
woman
is
young
said
hulot
besides
the
order
i
received
from
the
minister
gives
her
name
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
she
is
a
don
t
i
know
em
they
all
plied
one
trade
before
the
revolution
and
any
man
could
make
himself
a
major
or
a
general
in
time
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
say
dear
heart
to
them
now
and
while
each
soldier
opened
his
compasses
as
the
commandant
was
wont
to
say
the
miserable
vehicle
which
was
then
used
as
the
drew
up
before
the
inn
of
the
trois
maures
in
the
middle
of
the
main
street
of
alencon
the
sound
of
the
wheels
brought
the
landlord
to
the
door
no
one
in
alencon
could
have
expected
the
arrival
of
the
at
the
trois
maures
for
the
murderous
attack
upon
the
coach
at
mortagne
was
already
known
and
so
many
people
followed
it
along
the
street
that
the
two
women
anxious
to
escape
the
curiosity
of
the
crowd
ran
quickly
into
the
kitchen
which
forms
the
inevitable
antechamber
to
all
western
inns
the
landlord
was
about
to
follow
them
after
examining
the
coach
when
the
postilion
caught
him
by
the
arm
attention
citizen
brutus
he
said
there
s
an
escort
of
the
blues
behind
us
but
it
is
i
who
bring
you
these
female
citizens
they
ll
pay
like
princesses
therefore
therefore
we
ll
drink
a
glass
of
wine
together
presently
my
lad
said
the
landlord
after
glancing
about
the
kitchen
blackened
with
smoke
and
noticing
a
table
bloody
from
raw
meat
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
flew
into
the
next
room
with
the
celerity
of
a
bird
for
she
shuddered
at
the
sight
and
smell
of
the
place
and
feared
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
a
dirty
and
a
fat
little
woman
who
examined
her
attentively
what
are
we
to
do
wife
said
the
landlord
who
the
devil
could
have
supposed
we
would
have
so
many
on
our
hands
in
these
days
before
i
serve
her
a
decent
breakfast
that
woman
will
get
impatient
stop
an
idea
evidently
she
is
a
person
of
quality
i
ll
propose
to
put
her
with
the
one
we
have
upstairs
what
do
you
think
when
the
landlord
went
to
look
for
the
new
arrival
he
found
only
francine
to
whom
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
taking
her
to
the
farther
end
of
the
kitchen
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
if
the
ladies
wish
he
said
to
be
served
in
private
as
i
have
no
doubt
they
wish
to
do
i
have
a
very
nice
breakfast
all
ready
for
a
lady
and
her
son
and
i
dare
say
wouldn
t
mind
sharing
it
with
you
they
are
persons
of
condition
he
added
mysteriously
he
had
hardly
said
the
words
before
he
felt
a
tap
on
his
back
from
the
handle
of
a
whip
he
turned
hastily
and
saw
behind
him
a
short
man
who
had
noiselessly
entered
from
a
side
room
an
apparition
which
seemed
to
terrify
the
hostess
the
cook
and
the
scullion
the
landlord
turned
pale
when
he
saw
the
intruder
who
shook
back
the
hair
which
concealed
his
forehead
and
eyes
raised
himself
on
the
points
of
his
toes
to
reach
the
other
s
ears
and
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
you
know
the
cost
of
an
imprudence
or
a
betrayal
and
the
color
of
the
money
we
pay
it
in
we
are
generous
in
that
he
added
a
gesture
which
was
like
a
horrible
commentary
to
his
words
though
the
rotundity
of
the
landlord
prevented
francine
from
seeing
the
stranger
who
stood
behind
him
she
caught
certain
words
of
his
threatening
speech
and
was
thunderstruck
at
hearing
the
hoarse
tones
of
a
breton
voice
she
sprang
towards
the
man
but
he
seeming
to
move
with
the
agility
of
a
wild
animal
had
already
darted
through
a
side
door
which
opened
on
the
courtyard
utterly
amazed
she
ran
to
the
window
through
its
panes
yellowed
with
smoke
she
caught
sight
of
the
stranger
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
stable
before
doing
so
however
he
turned
a
pair
of
black
eyes
to
the
upper
story
of
the
inn
and
thence
to
the
in
the
yard
as
if
to
call
some
friend
s
attention
to
the
vehicle
in
spite
of
his
muffling
goatskin
and
thanks
to
this
movement
which
allowed
her
to
see
his
face
francine
recognized
the
chouan
with
his
heavy
whip
she
saw
him
indistinctly
in
the
obscurity
of
the
stable
fling
himself
down
on
a
pile
of
straw
in
a
position
which
enabled
him
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
that
happened
at
the
inn
curled
himself
up
in
such
a
way
that
the
cleverest
spy
at
any
distance
far
or
near
might
have
taken
him
for
one
of
those
huge
dogs
that
drag
the
lying
asleep
with
his
muzzle
on
his
paws
the
behavior
of
the
chouan
proved
to
francine
that
he
had
not
recognized
her
under
the
hazardous
circumstances
which
she
felt
her
mistress
to
be
in
she
scarcely
knew
whether
to
regret
or
to
rejoice
in
this
unconsciousness
but
the
mysterious
connection
between
the
landlord
s
offer
not
uncommon
among
innkeepers
who
can
thus
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
the
chouan
s
threats
piqued
her
curiosity
she
left
the
dirty
window
from
which
she
could
see
the
formless
heap
which
she
knew
to
be
and
returned
to
the
landlord
who
was
still
standing
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
who
feels
he
has
made
a
blunder
and
does
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
the
chouan
s
gesture
had
petrified
the
poor
fellow
no
one
in
the
west
was
ignorant
of
the
cruel
refinements
of
torture
with
which
the
chasseurs
du
roi
punished
those
who
were
even
suspected
of
indiscretion
the
landlord
felt
their
knives
already
at
his
throat
the
cook
looked
with
a
shudder
at
the
iron
stove
on
which
they
often
warmed
chauffaient
the
feet
of
those
they
suspected
the
fat
landlady
held
a
knife
in
one
hand
and
a
potato
in
the
other
and
gazed
at
her
husband
with
a
stupefied
air
even
the
scullion
puzzled
himself
to
know
the
reason
of
their
speechless
terror
francine
s
curiosity
was
naturally
excited
by
this
silent
scene
the
principal
actor
of
which
was
visible
to
all
though
departed
the
girl
was
gratified
at
the
evident
power
of
the
chouan
and
though
by
nature
too
simple
and
humble
for
the
tricks
of
a
lady
s
maid
she
was
also
far
too
anxious
to
penetrate
the
mystery
not
to
profit
by
her
advantages
on
this
occasion
mademoiselle
accepts
your
proposal
she
said
to
the
landlord
who
jumped
as
if
suddenly
awakened
by
her
words
what
proposal
he
asked
with
genuine
surprise
what
proposal
asked
corentin
entering
the
kitchen
what
proposal
asked
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
returning
to
it
what
proposal
asked
a
fourth
individual
on
the
lower
step
of
the
staircase
who
now
sprang
lightly
into
the
kitchen
why
the
breakfast
with
your
persons
of
distinction
replied
francine
impatiently
distinction
said
the
ringing
and
ironical
voice
of
the
person
who
had
just
come
down
the
stairway
my
good
fellow
that
strikes
me
as
a
very
poor
inn
joke
but
if
it
s
the
company
of
this
young
female
citizen
that
you
want
to
give
us
we
should
be
fools
to
refuse
it
in
my
mother
s
absence
i
accept
he
added
striking
the
astonished
innkeeper
on
the
shoulder
the
charming
heedlessness
of
youth
disguised
the
haughty
insolence
of
the
words
which
drew
the
attention
of
every
one
present
to
the
the
landlord
at
once
assumed
the
countenance
of
pilate
washing
his
hands
of
the
blood
of
that
just
man
he
slid
back
two
steps
to
reach
his
wife
s
ear
and
whispered
you
are
witness
if
any
harm
comes
of
it
that
it
is
not
my
fault
but
anyhow
he
added
in
a
voice
that
was
lower
still
go
and
tell
monsieur
what
has
the
traveller
who
was
a
young
man
of
medium
height
wore
a
dark
blue
coat
and
high
black
gaiters
coming
above
the
knee
and
over
the
breeches
which
were
also
of
blue
cloth
this
simple
uniform
without
epaulets
was
that
of
the
pupils
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
beneath
this
plain
attire
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
could
distinguish
at
a
glance
the
elegant
shape
and
nameless
that
tells
of
natural
nobility
the
face
of
the
young
man
which
was
rather
ordinary
at
first
sight
soon
attracted
the
eye
by
the
conformation
of
certain
features
which
revealed
a
soul
capable
of
great
things
a
bronzed
skin
curly
fair
hair
sparkling
blue
eyes
a
delicate
nose
motions
full
of
ease
all
disclosed
a
life
guided
by
noble
sentiments
and
trained
to
the
habit
of
command
but
the
most
characteristic
signs
of
his
nature
were
in
the
chin
which
was
dented
like
that
of
bonaparte
and
in
the
lower
lip
which
joined
the
upper
one
with
a
graceful
curve
like
that
of
an
acanthus
leaf
on
the
capital
of
a
corinthian
column
nature
had
given
to
these
two
features
of
his
face
an
irresistible
charm
this
young
man
has
singular
distinction
if
he
is
really
a
republican
thought
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
see
all
this
at
a
glance
to
brighten
at
the
thought
of
pleasing
to
bend
her
head
softly
and
smile
coquettishly
and
cast
a
soft
look
able
to
revive
a
heart
that
was
dead
to
love
to
veil
her
long
black
eyes
with
lids
whose
curving
lashes
made
shadows
on
her
cheeks
to
choose
the
melodious
tones
of
her
voice
and
give
a
penetrating
charm
to
the
formal
words
monsieur
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
all
this
charming
took
less
time
than
it
has
taken
to
describe
it
after
this
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
addressing
the
landlord
asked
to
be
shown
to
a
room
saw
the
staircase
and
disappeared
with
francine
leaving
the
stranger
to
discover
whether
her
reply
was
intended
as
an
acceptance
or
a
refusal
who
is
that
woman
asked
the
polytechnique
student
in
an
airy
manner
of
the
landlord
who
still
stood
motionless
and
bewildered
that
s
the
female
citizen
verneuil
replied
corentin
sharply
looking
jealously
at
the
questioner
a
what
is
she
to
you
the
stranger
who
was
humming
a
revolutionary
tune
turned
his
head
haughtily
towards
corentin
the
two
young
men
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
like
cocks
about
to
fight
and
the
glance
they
exchanged
gave
birth
to
a
hatred
which
lasted
forever
the
blue
eye
of
the
young
soldier
was
as
frank
and
honest
as
the
green
eye
of
the
other
man
was
false
and
malicious
the
manners
of
the
one
had
native
grandeur
those
of
the
other
were
insinuating
one
was
eager
in
his
advance
the
other
deprecating
one
commanded
respect
the
other
sought
it
is
the
citizen
du
gua
here
said
a
peasant
entering
the
kitchen
at
that
moment
what
do
you
want
of
him
said
the
young
man
coming
forward
the
peasant
made
a
low
bow
and
gave
him
a
letter
which
the
young
cadet
read
and
threw
into
the
fire
then
he
nodded
his
head
and
the
man
withdrew
no
doubt
you
ve
come
from
paris
citizen
said
corentin
approaching
the
stranger
with
a
certain
ease
of
manner
and
a
pliant
affable
air
which
seemed
intolerable
to
the
citizen
du
gua
yes
he
replied
shortly
i
suppose
you
have
been
graduated
into
some
grade
of
the
artillery
no
citizen
into
the
ah
then
you
are
going
to
brest
said
corentin
interrogatively
but
the
young
sailor
turned
lightly
on
the
heels
of
his
shoes
without
deigning
to
reply
and
presently
disappointed
all
the
expectations
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
based
on
the
charm
of
his
appearance
he
applied
himself
to
ordering
his
breakfast
with
the
eagerness
of
a
boy
questioned
the
cook
and
the
landlady
about
their
receipts
wondered
at
provincial
customs
like
a
parisian
just
out
of
his
shell
made
as
many
objections
as
any
fine
lady
and
showed
the
more
lack
of
mind
and
character
because
his
face
and
manner
had
seemed
to
promise
them
corentin
smiled
with
pity
when
he
saw
the
face
he
made
on
tasting
the
best
cider
of
normandy
heu
he
cried
how
can
you
swallow
such
stuff
as
that
it
is
meat
and
drink
both
i
don
t
wonder
the
republic
distrusts
a
province
where
they
knock
their
harvest
from
trees
with
poles
and
shoot
travellers
from
the
ditches
pray
don
t
put
such
medicine
as
that
on
the
table
give
us
some
good
bordeaux
white
and
red
and
above
all
do
see
if
there
is
a
good
fire
upstairs
these
are
so
backward
in
civilization
he
added
alas
he
sighed
there
is
but
one
paris
in
the
world
what
a
pity
it
is
i
can
t
transport
it
to
sea
heavens
he
suddenly
cried
out
to
the
cook
what
makes
you
put
vinegar
in
that
fricassee
when
you
have
lemons
and
madame
he
added
you
gave
me
such
coarse
sheets
i
couldn
t
close
my
eyes
all
then
he
began
to
twirl
a
huge
cane
executing
with
a
silly
sort
of
care
a
variety
of
evolutions
the
greater
or
less
precision
and
agility
of
which
were
considered
proofs
of
a
young
man
s
standing
in
the
class
of
the
incroyables
and
it
is
with
such
dandies
as
that
said
corentin
to
the
landlord
confidentially
watching
his
face
that
the
republic
expects
to
improve
her
navy
that
man
said
the
young
sailor
to
the
landlady
in
a
low
voice
is
a
spy
of
fouche
s
he
has
police
stamped
on
his
face
and
i
ll
swear
that
spot
he
has
got
on
his
chin
is
paris
mud
well
set
a
thief
to
catch
just
then
a
lady
to
whom
the
young
sailor
turned
with
every
sign
of
outward
respect
entered
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
my
dear
mamma
he
said
i
am
glad
you
ve
come
i
have
recruited
some
guests
in
your
guests
she
replied
what
folly
it
is
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
he
said
in
a
low
voice
she
perished
on
the
scaffold
after
the
affair
of
savenay
she
went
to
mans
to
save
her
brother
the
prince
de
loudon
returned
his
mother
rather
brusquely
you
are
mistaken
madame
said
corentin
gently
emphasizing
the
word
madame
there
are
two
demoiselles
de
verneuil
all
great
houses
as
you
know
have
several
the
lady
surprised
at
this
freedom
drew
back
a
few
steps
to
examine
the
speaker
she
turned
her
black
eyes
upon
him
full
of
the
keen
sagacity
so
natural
to
women
seeking
apparently
to
discover
in
what
interest
he
stepped
forth
to
explain
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
birth
corentin
on
the
other
hand
who
was
studying
the
lady
cautiously
denied
her
in
his
own
mind
the
joys
of
motherhood
and
gave
her
those
of
love
he
refused
the
possession
of
a
son
of
twenty
to
a
woman
whose
dazzling
skin
and
arched
eyebrows
and
lashes
still
unblemished
were
the
objects
of
his
admiration
and
whose
abundant
black
hair
parted
on
the
forehead
into
simple
bands
bought
out
the
youthfulness
of
an
intelligent
head
the
slight
lines
of
the
brow
far
from
indicating
age
revealed
young
passions
though
the
piercing
eyes
were
somewhat
veiled
it
was
either
from
the
fatigue
of
travelling
or
the
too
frequent
expression
of
excitement
corentin
remarked
that
she
was
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
english
material
and
that
the
shape
of
her
hat
foreign
no
doubt
did
not
belong
to
any
of
the
styles
called
greek
which
ruled
the
parisian
fashions
of
the
period
corentin
was
one
of
those
beings
who
are
compelled
by
the
bent
of
their
natures
to
suspect
evil
rather
than
good
and
he
instantly
doubted
the
citizenship
of
the
two
travellers
the
lady
who
on
her
side
had
made
her
observations
on
the
person
of
corentin
with
equal
rapidity
turned
to
her
son
with
a
significant
look
which
may
be
faithfully
translated
into
the
words
who
is
this
queer
man
is
he
of
our
stripe
to
this
mute
inquiry
the
youth
replied
by
an
attitude
and
a
gesture
which
said
faith
i
can
t
tell
but
i
distrust
then
leaving
his
mother
to
fathom
the
mystery
he
turned
to
the
landlady
and
whispered
try
to
find
out
who
that
fellow
is
and
whether
he
is
really
accompanying
the
young
lady
and
so
said
madame
du
gua
looking
at
corentin
you
are
quite
sure
citizen
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
is
living
she
is
living
in
flesh
and
blood
as
surely
as
the
citizen
du
gua
this
answer
contained
a
sarcasm
the
hidden
meaning
of
which
was
known
to
none
but
the
lady
herself
and
any
one
but
herself
would
have
been
disconcerted
by
it
her
son
looked
fixedly
at
corentin
who
coolly
pulled
out
his
watch
without
appearing
to
notice
the
effect
of
his
answer
the
lady
uneasy
and
anxious
to
discover
at
once
if
the
speech
meant
danger
or
was
merely
accidental
said
to
corentin
in
a
natural
tone
and
manner
how
little
security
there
is
on
these
roads
we
were
attacked
by
chouans
just
beyond
mortagne
my
son
came
very
near
being
killed
he
received
two
balls
in
his
hat
while
protecting
is
it
possible
madame
were
you
in
the
which
those
brigands
robbed
in
spite
of
the
escort
the
one
we
have
just
come
by
you
must
know
the
vehicle
well
they
told
me
at
mortagne
that
the
chouans
numbered
a
couple
of
thousands
and
that
every
one
in
the
coach
was
killed
even
the
travellers
that
s
how
history
is
written
alas
madame
he
continued
if
they
murder
travellers
so
near
to
paris
you
can
fancy
how
unsafe
the
roads
are
in
brittany
i
shall
return
to
paris
and
not
risk
myself
any
is
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
young
and
handsome
said
the
lady
to
the
hostess
struck
suddenly
with
an
idea
just
then
the
landlord
interrupted
the
conversation
in
which
there
was
something
of
an
angry
element
by
announcing
that
breakfast
was
ready
the
young
sailor
offered
his
hand
to
his
mother
with
an
air
of
false
familiarity
that
confirmed
the
suspicions
of
corentin
to
whom
the
youth
remarked
as
he
went
up
the
stairway
citizen
if
you
are
travelling
with
the
female
citizen
de
verneuil
and
she
accepts
the
landlord
s
proposal
you
can
come
though
the
words
were
said
in
a
careless
tone
and
were
not
inviting
corentin
followed
the
young
man
squeezed
the
lady
s
hand
when
they
were
five
or
six
steps
above
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
now
you
see
the
dangers
to
which
your
imprudent
enterprises
which
have
no
glory
in
them
expose
us
if
we
are
discovered
how
are
we
to
escape
and
what
a
contemptible
role
you
force
me
to
play
all
three
reached
a
large
room
on
the
upper
floor
any
one
who
has
travelled
in
the
west
will
know
that
the
landlord
had
on
such
an
occasion
brought
forth
his
best
things
to
do
honor
to
his
guests
and
prepared
the
meal
with
no
ordinary
luxury
the
table
was
carefully
laid
the
warmth
of
a
large
fire
took
the
dampness
from
the
room
the
linen
glass
and
china
were
not
too
dingy
corentin
saw
at
once
that
the
landlord
had
as
they
say
familiarly
cut
himself
into
quarters
to
please
the
strangers
consequently
thought
he
these
people
are
not
what
they
pretend
to
be
that
young
man
is
clever
i
took
him
for
a
fool
but
i
begin
to
believe
him
as
shrewd
as
the
sailor
his
mother
and
corentin
awaited
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whom
the
landlord
went
to
summon
but
the
handsome
traveller
did
not
come
the
youth
expected
that
she
would
make
difficulties
and
he
left
the
room
humming
the
popular
song
guard
the
nation
s
safety
and
went
to
that
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
prompted
by
a
keen
desire
to
get
the
better
of
her
scruples
and
take
her
back
with
him
perhaps
he
wanted
to
solve
the
doubts
which
filled
his
mind
or
else
to
exercise
the
power
which
all
men
like
to
think
they
wield
over
a
pretty
woman
may
i
be
hanged
if
he
s
a
republican
thought
corentin
as
he
saw
him
go
he
moves
his
shoulders
like
a
courtier
and
if
that
s
his
mother
he
added
mentally
looking
at
madame
du
gua
i
m
the
pope
they
are
chouans
and
i
ll
make
sure
of
their
the
door
soon
opened
and
the
young
man
entered
holding
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whom
he
led
to
the
table
with
an
air
of
that
was
nevertheless
courteous
the
devil
had
not
allowed
that
hour
which
had
elapsed
since
the
lady
s
arrival
to
be
wasted
with
francine
s
assistance
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
armed
herself
with
a
more
dangerous
perhaps
than
any
attire
its
simplicity
had
precisely
that
attraction
which
comes
of
the
skill
with
which
a
woman
handsome
enough
to
wear
no
ornaments
reduces
her
dress
to
the
position
of
a
secondary
charm
she
wore
a
green
gown
elegantly
cut
the
jacket
of
which
braided
and
frogged
defined
her
figure
in
a
manner
that
was
hardly
suitable
for
a
young
girl
allowing
her
supple
waist
and
rounded
bust
and
graceful
motions
to
be
fully
seen
she
entered
the
room
smiling
with
the
natural
amenity
of
women
who
can
show
a
fine
set
of
teeth
transparent
as
porcelain
between
rosy
lips
and
dimpling
cheeks
as
fresh
as
those
of
childhood
having
removed
the
close
hood
which
had
almost
concealed
her
head
at
her
first
meeting
with
the
young
sailor
she
could
now
employ
at
her
ease
the
various
little
artifices
apparently
so
artless
with
which
a
woman
shows
off
the
beauties
of
her
face
and
the
grace
of
her
head
and
attracts
admiration
for
them
a
certain
harmony
between
her
manners
and
her
dress
made
her
seem
so
much
younger
than
she
was
that
madame
du
gua
thought
herself
beyond
the
mark
in
supposing
her
over
twenty
the
coquetry
of
her
apparel
evidently
worn
to
please
was
enough
to
inspire
hope
in
the
young
man
s
breast
but
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
bowed
to
him
as
she
took
her
place
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
and
without
looking
at
him
putting
him
aside
with
an
apparently
carelessness
which
disconcerted
him
this
coolness
might
have
seemed
to
an
observer
neither
caution
nor
coquetry
but
indifference
natural
or
feigned
the
candid
expression
on
the
young
lady
s
face
only
made
it
the
more
impenetrable
she
showed
no
consciousness
of
her
charms
and
was
apparently
gifted
with
the
pretty
manners
that
win
all
hearts
and
had
already
duped
the
natural
of
the
young
sailor
thus
baffled
the
youth
returned
to
his
own
seat
with
a
sort
of
vexation
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
took
francine
who
accompanied
her
by
the
hand
and
said
in
a
caressing
voice
turning
to
madame
de
gua
madame
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
allow
this
young
girl
who
is
more
a
friend
than
a
servant
to
me
to
sit
with
us
in
these
perilous
times
such
devotion
as
hers
can
only
be
repaid
by
the
heart
indeed
that
is
very
nearly
all
that
is
left
to
madame
du
gua
replied
to
the
last
words
which
were
said
half
aside
with
a
rather
unceremonious
bow
that
betrayed
her
annoyance
at
the
beauty
of
the
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
to
her
son
perilous
times
devotion
madame
servant
that
is
not
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
it
is
some
girl
sent
here
by
the
guests
were
about
to
sit
down
when
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
noticed
corentin
who
was
still
employed
in
a
close
scrutiny
of
the
mother
and
son
who
were
showing
some
annoyance
at
his
glances
citizen
she
said
to
him
you
are
no
doubt
too
well
bred
to
dog
my
steps
the
republic
when
it
sent
my
parents
to
the
scaffold
did
not
magnanimously
provide
me
with
a
guardian
though
you
have
from
extreme
and
chivalric
gallantry
accompanied
me
against
my
will
to
this
place
she
sighed
i
am
quite
resolved
not
to
allow
your
protecting
care
to
become
a
burden
to
you
i
am
safe
now
and
you
can
leave
she
gave
him
a
fixed
and
contemptuous
look
corentin
understood
her
he
repressed
the
smile
which
almost
curled
the
corners
of
his
wily
lips
as
he
bowed
to
her
respectfully
citoyenne
he
said
it
is
always
an
honor
to
obey
you
beauty
is
the
only
queen
a
republican
can
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
eyes
as
she
watched
him
depart
shone
with
such
natural
pleasure
she
looked
at
francine
with
a
smile
of
intelligence
which
betrayed
so
much
real
satisfaction
that
madame
du
gua
who
grew
prudent
as
she
grew
jealous
felt
disposed
to
relinquish
the
suspicions
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
great
beauty
had
forced
into
her
mind
it
may
be
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
after
all
she
whispered
to
her
son
but
that
escort
answered
the
young
man
whose
vexation
at
the
young
lady
s
indifference
allowed
him
to
be
cautious
is
she
a
prisoner
or
an
emissary
a
friend
or
an
enemy
of
the
government
madame
du
gua
made
a
sign
as
if
to
say
that
she
would
soon
clear
up
the
mystery
however
the
departure
of
corentin
seemed
to
lessen
the
young
man
s
distrust
and
he
began
to
cast
on
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
certain
looks
which
betrayed
an
immoderate
admiration
for
women
rather
than
the
respectful
warmth
of
a
dawning
passion
the
young
girl
grew
more
and
more
reserved
and
gave
all
her
attentions
to
madame
du
gua
the
youth
angry
with
himself
tried
in
his
vexation
to
turn
the
tables
and
seem
indifferent
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
appeared
not
to
notice
this
manoeuvre
she
continued
to
be
simple
without
shyness
and
reserved
without
prudery
this
chance
meeting
of
personages
who
apparently
were
not
destined
to
become
intimate
awakened
no
agreeable
sympathy
on
either
side
there
was
even
a
sort
of
vulgar
embarrassment
an
awkwardness
which
destroyed
all
the
pleasure
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
the
young
sailor
had
begun
by
expecting
but
women
have
such
wonderful
conventional
tact
they
are
so
intimately
allied
with
each
other
or
they
have
such
keen
desires
for
emotion
that
they
always
know
how
to
break
the
ice
on
such
occasions
suddenly
as
if
the
two
beauties
had
the
same
thought
they
began
to
tease
their
solitary
knight
in
a
playful
way
and
were
soon
vying
with
each
other
in
the
jesting
attention
which
they
paid
to
him
this
unanimity
of
action
left
them
free
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
two
women
already
secret
enemies
were
apparently
the
best
of
friends
the
young
man
then
discovered
that
he
felt
as
angry
with
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
for
her
friendliness
and
freedom
as
he
had
been
with
her
reserve
in
fact
he
was
so
annoyed
by
it
that
he
regretted
with
a
sort
of
dumb
anger
having
allowed
her
to
breakfast
with
them
madame
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
is
your
son
always
as
gloomy
as
he
is
at
this
moment
mademoiselle
he
replied
i
ask
myself
what
is
the
good
of
a
fleeting
happiness
the
secret
of
my
gloom
is
the
evanescence
of
my
that
is
a
madrigal
she
said
laughing
which
rings
of
the
court
rather
than
the
my
son
only
expressed
a
very
natural
thought
mademoiselle
said
madame
du
gua
who
had
her
own
reasons
for
placating
the
stranger
then
laugh
while
you
may
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
smiling
at
the
young
man
how
do
you
look
when
you
have
really
something
to
weep
for
if
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
a
happiness
makes
you
so
dismal
this
smile
accompanied
by
a
provoking
glance
which
destroyed
the
consistency
of
her
reserve
revived
the
youth
s
feelings
but
inspired
by
her
nature
which
often
impels
a
woman
to
do
either
too
much
or
too
little
under
such
circumstances
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
having
covered
the
young
man
with
that
brilliant
look
full
of
love
s
promises
immediately
withdrew
from
his
answering
expression
into
a
cold
and
severe
modesty
a
conventional
performance
by
which
a
woman
sometimes
hides
a
true
emotion
in
a
moment
a
single
moment
when
each
expected
to
see
the
eyelids
of
the
other
lowered
they
had
communicated
to
one
another
their
real
thoughts
but
they
veiled
their
glances
as
quickly
as
they
had
mingled
them
in
that
one
flash
which
convulsed
their
hearts
and
enlightened
them
confused
at
having
said
so
many
things
in
a
single
glance
they
dared
no
longer
look
at
each
other
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
withdrew
into
cold
politeness
and
seemed
to
be
impatient
for
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
mademoiselle
you
must
have
suffered
very
much
in
prison
said
madame
du
gua
alas
madame
i
sometimes
think
that
i
am
still
is
your
escort
sent
to
protect
you
mademoiselle
or
to
watch
you
are
you
still
suspected
by
the
republic
mademoiselle
felt
instinctively
that
madame
du
gua
had
no
real
interest
in
her
and
the
question
alarmed
her
madame
she
replied
i
really
do
not
know
myself
the
exact
nature
of
my
relations
to
the
perhaps
it
fears
you
said
the
young
man
rather
satirically
we
must
respect
her
secrets
interposed
madame
du
gua
oh
madame
the
secrets
of
a
young
girl
who
knows
nothing
of
life
but
its
misfortunes
are
not
but
answered
madame
du
gua
wishing
to
continue
a
conversation
which
might
reveal
to
her
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
the
first
consul
seems
to
have
excellent
intentions
they
say
that
he
is
going
to
remove
the
disabilities
of
the
that
is
true
madame
she
replied
with
rather
too
much
eagerness
and
if
so
why
do
we
rouse
brittany
and
la
vendee
why
bring
civil
war
into
france
this
eager
cry
in
which
she
seemed
to
share
her
own
reproach
made
the
young
sailor
quiver
he
looked
earnestly
at
her
but
was
unable
to
detect
either
hatred
or
love
upon
her
face
her
beautiful
skin
the
delicacy
of
which
was
shown
by
the
color
beneath
it
was
impenetrable
a
sudden
and
invincible
curiosity
attracted
him
to
this
strange
creature
to
whom
he
was
already
drawn
by
violent
desires
madame
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
after
a
pause
may
i
ask
if
you
are
going
to
mayenne
yes
mademoiselle
replied
the
young
man
with
a
questioning
look
then
madame
she
continued
as
your
son
serves
the
republic
she
said
the
words
with
an
apparently
indifferent
air
but
she
gave
her
companions
one
of
those
furtive
glances
the
art
of
which
belongs
to
women
and
diplomatists
you
must
fear
the
chouans
and
an
escort
is
not
to
be
despised
we
are
now
almost
travelling
companions
and
i
hope
you
will
come
with
me
to
mother
and
son
hesitated
and
seemed
to
consult
each
other
s
faces
i
am
not
sure
mademoiselle
said
the
young
man
that
it
is
prudent
in
me
to
tell
you
that
interests
of
the
highest
importance
require
our
presence
in
the
neighborhood
of
fougeres
and
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
a
means
of
conveyance
but
women
are
so
naturally
generous
that
i
am
ashamed
not
to
confide
in
you
nevertheless
he
added
before
putting
ourselves
in
your
hands
i
ought
to
know
whether
we
shall
get
out
of
them
safe
and
sound
in
short
mademoiselle
are
you
the
sovereign
or
the
slave
of
your
republican
escort
pardon
my
frankness
but
your
position
does
not
seem
to
me
exactly
natural
we
live
in
times
monsieur
when
nothing
takes
place
naturally
you
can
accept
my
proposal
without
anxiety
above
all
she
added
emphasizing
her
words
you
need
fear
no
treachery
in
an
offer
made
by
a
woman
who
has
no
part
in
political
a
journey
thus
made
is
not
without
danger
he
said
with
a
look
which
gave
significance
to
that
commonplace
remark
what
is
it
you
fear
she
answered
smiling
sarcastically
i
see
no
peril
for
any
is
this
the
woman
who
a
moment
ago
shared
my
desires
in
her
eyes
thought
the
young
man
what
a
tone
in
her
voice
she
is
laying
a
trap
for
at
that
instant
a
shrill
cry
of
an
owl
which
appeared
to
have
perched
on
the
chimney
top
vibrated
in
the
air
like
a
warning
what
does
that
mean
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
our
journey
together
will
not
begin
under
favorable
auspices
do
owls
in
these
woods
screech
by
daylight
she
added
with
a
surprised
gesture
sometimes
said
the
young
man
coolly
mademoiselle
he
continued
we
may
bring
you
you
are
thinking
of
that
i
am
sure
we
had
better
not
travel
these
words
were
said
with
a
calmness
and
reserve
which
puzzled
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
monsieur
she
replied
with
truly
aristocratic
insolence
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
compel
you
pray
let
us
keep
the
little
liberty
the
republic
leaves
us
if
madame
were
alone
i
should
insist
the
heavy
step
of
a
soldier
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
the
commandant
hulot
presently
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
frowning
brow
come
here
colonel
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
smiling
and
pointing
to
a
chair
beside
her
let
us
talk
over
the
affairs
of
state
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
are
there
chouans
here
the
commandant
stood
speechless
on
catching
sight
of
the
young
man
at
whom
he
looked
with
peculiar
attention
mamma
will
you
take
some
more
hare
mademoiselle
you
are
not
eating
said
the
sailor
to
francine
seeming
busy
with
the
guests
but
hulot
s
astonishment
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
close
observation
had
something
too
dangerously
serious
about
them
to
be
ignored
what
is
it
citizen
said
the
young
man
abruptly
do
you
know
me
perhaps
i
do
replied
the
republican
you
are
right
i
remember
you
at
the
i
never
went
to
any
school
said
the
soldier
roughly
what
school
do
you
mean
the
ha
ha
those
barracks
where
they
expect
to
make
soldiers
in
dormitories
said
the
veteran
whose
aversion
for
officers
trained
in
that
nursery
was
insurmountable
to
what
arm
do
you
belong
i
am
in
the
ha
cried
hulot
smiling
vindictively
how
many
of
your
are
in
the
navy
don
t
you
know
he
added
in
a
serious
tone
that
none
but
the
artillery
and
the
engineers
graduate
from
there
the
young
man
was
not
disconcerted
an
exception
was
made
in
my
favor
on
account
of
the
name
i
bear
he
answered
we
are
all
naval
men
in
our
what
is
the
name
of
your
family
citizen
asked
hulot
du
gua
then
you
were
not
killed
at
mortagne
he
came
very
near
being
killed
said
madame
du
gua
quickly
my
son
received
two
balls
in
where
are
your
papers
asked
hulot
not
listening
to
the
mother
do
you
propose
to
read
them
said
the
young
man
cavalierly
his
blue
eye
keen
with
suspicion
studied
alternately
the
gloomy
face
of
the
commandant
and
that
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
a
stripling
like
you
to
pretend
to
fool
me
come
produce
your
papers
or
la
la
citizen
i
m
not
such
a
babe
as
i
look
to
be
why
should
i
answer
you
who
are
you
the
commander
of
this
department
answered
hulot
oh
then
of
course
the
matter
is
serious
i
am
taken
with
arms
in
my
hand
and
he
held
a
glass
full
of
bordeaux
to
the
soldier
i
am
not
thirsty
said
hulot
come
your
at
that
instant
the
rattle
of
arms
and
the
tread
of
men
was
heard
in
the
street
hulot
walked
to
the
window
and
gave
a
satisfied
look
which
made
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
tremble
that
sign
of
interest
on
her
part
seemed
to
fire
the
young
man
whose
face
had
grown
cold
and
haughty
after
feeling
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
he
drew
forth
an
elegant
portfolio
and
presented
certain
papers
to
the
commandant
which
the
latter
read
slowly
comparing
the
description
given
in
the
passport
with
the
face
and
figure
of
the
young
man
before
him
during
this
prolonged
examination
the
owl
s
cry
rose
again
but
this
time
there
was
no
difficulty
whatever
in
recognizing
a
human
voice
the
commandant
at
once
returned
the
papers
to
the
young
man
with
a
scoffing
look
that
s
all
very
fine
he
said
but
i
don
t
like
the
music
you
will
come
with
me
to
why
do
you
take
him
there
asked
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
in
a
tone
of
some
excitement
my
good
lady
replied
the
commandant
with
his
usual
grimace
that
s
none
of
your
irritated
by
the
tone
and
words
of
the
old
soldier
but
still
more
at
the
sort
of
humiliation
offered
to
her
in
presence
of
a
man
who
was
under
the
influence
of
her
charms
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
rose
abandoning
the
simple
and
modest
manner
she
had
hitherto
adopted
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
shone
as
she
said
in
a
quiet
tone
but
with
a
trembling
voice
tell
me
has
this
young
man
met
all
the
requirements
of
the
law
yes
apparently
said
hulot
ironically
then
i
desire
that
you
will
leave
him
alone
she
said
are
you
afraid
he
will
escape
you
you
are
to
escort
him
with
me
to
mayenne
he
will
be
in
the
coach
with
his
mother
make
no
objection
it
is
my
will
well
what
she
added
noticing
hulot
s
grimace
do
you
suspect
him
still
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
him
oh
nothing
balance
his
head
with
a
little
lead
perhaps
he
s
a
said
the
commandant
ironically
are
you
joking
colonel
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
come
said
the
commandant
nodding
to
the
young
man
make
haste
let
us
be
at
this
impertinence
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
became
calm
and
smiling
do
not
go
she
said
to
the
young
man
protecting
him
with
a
gesture
that
was
full
of
dignity
oh
what
a
beautiful
head
said
the
youth
to
his
mother
who
frowned
heavily
annoyance
and
many
other
sentiments
aroused
and
struggled
with
did
certainly
bring
fresh
beauties
to
the
young
woman
s
face
francine
madame
du
gua
and
her
son
had
all
risen
from
their
seats
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
hastily
advanced
and
stood
between
them
and
the
commandant
who
smiled
amusedly
then
she
rapidly
unfastened
the
frogged
fastenings
of
her
jacket
acting
with
that
blindness
which
often
seizes
women
when
their
is
threatened
and
they
are
anxious
to
show
their
power
as
a
child
is
impatient
to
play
with
a
toy
that
has
just
been
given
to
it
she
took
from
her
bosom
a
paper
and
presented
it
to
hulot
read
that
she
said
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
then
she
turned
to
the
young
man
and
gave
him
in
the
excitement
of
her
triumph
a
look
in
which
mischief
was
mingled
with
an
expression
of
love
their
brows
cleared
joy
flushed
each
agitated
face
and
a
thousand
contradictory
thoughts
rose
in
their
hearts
madame
du
gua
noted
in
that
one
look
far
more
of
love
than
of
pity
in
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
intervention
and
she
was
right
the
handsome
creature
blushed
beneath
the
other
woman
s
gaze
understanding
its
meaning
and
dropped
her
eyelids
then
as
if
aware
of
some
threatening
accusation
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
defied
all
eyes
the
commandant
petrified
returned
the
paper
countersigned
by
ministers
which
enjoined
all
authorities
to
obey
the
orders
of
this
mysterious
lady
having
done
so
he
drew
his
sword
laid
it
across
his
knees
broke
the
blade
and
flung
away
the
pieces
mademoiselle
you
probably
know
what
you
are
about
but
a
republican
has
his
own
ideas
and
his
own
dignity
i
can
not
serve
where
women
command
the
first
consul
will
receive
my
resignation
others
who
are
not
of
my
stripe
may
obey
you
i
do
not
understand
my
orders
and
therefore
i
stop
short
all
the
more
because
i
am
supposed
to
understand
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
but
it
was
soon
broken
by
the
young
lady
who
went
up
to
the
commandant
and
held
out
her
hand
saying
colonel
though
your
beard
is
somewhat
long
you
may
kiss
my
hand
you
are
indeed
a
man
i
flatter
myself
i
am
mademoiselle
he
replied
depositing
a
kiss
upon
the
hand
of
this
singular
young
woman
rather
awkwardly
as
for
you
friend
he
said
threatening
the
young
man
with
his
finger
you
have
had
a
narrow
escape
this
commandant
said
the
youth
it
is
time
all
this
nonsense
should
cease
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
if
you
like
to
and
bring
your
invisible
owl
who
is
asked
the
young
man
showing
all
the
signs
of
genuine
surprise
didn
t
he
hoot
just
now
what
did
that
hooting
have
to
do
with
me
i
should
like
to
know
i
supposed
it
was
your
soldiers
letting
you
know
of
their
nonsense
you
did
not
think
yes
i
did
but
do
drink
that
glass
of
bordeaux
the
wine
is
surprised
at
the
natural
behaviour
of
the
youth
and
also
by
the
frivolity
of
his
manners
and
the
youthfulness
of
his
face
made
even
more
juvenile
by
the
careful
curling
of
his
fair
hair
the
commandant
hesitated
in
the
midst
of
his
suspicions
he
noticed
that
madame
du
gua
was
intently
watching
the
glances
that
her
son
gave
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
he
asked
her
abruptly
how
old
are
you
ah
monsieur
l
officier
she
said
the
rules
of
the
republic
are
very
severe
must
i
tell
you
that
i
am
may
i
be
shot
if
i
believe
it
is
here
it
was
he
who
gave
that
cry
you
are
chouans
in
disguise
god
s
thunder
i
ll
search
the
inn
and
make
sure
of
it
just
then
a
hoot
somewhat
like
those
that
preceded
it
came
from
the
courtyard
the
commandant
rushed
out
and
missed
seeing
the
pallor
that
covered
madame
du
gua
s
face
as
he
spoke
hulot
saw
at
once
that
the
sound
came
from
a
postilion
harnessing
his
horses
to
the
coach
and
he
cast
aside
his
suspicions
all
the
more
because
it
seemed
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
chouans
would
risk
themselves
in
alencon
he
returned
to
the
house
confounded
i
forgive
him
now
but
later
he
shall
pay
dear
for
the
anxiety
he
has
given
us
said
the
mother
to
the
son
in
a
low
voice
as
hulot
the
room
the
brave
old
officer
showed
on
his
worried
face
the
struggle
that
went
on
in
his
mind
betwixt
a
stern
sense
of
duty
and
the
natural
kindness
of
his
heart
he
kept
his
gruff
air
partly
perhaps
because
he
fancied
he
had
deceived
himself
but
he
took
the
glass
of
bordeaux
and
said
excuse
me
comrade
but
your
polytechnique
does
send
such
young
officers
the
chouans
have
younger
ones
said
the
youth
laughing
for
whom
did
you
take
my
son
asked
madame
du
gua
for
the
gars
the
leader
sent
to
the
chouans
and
the
vendeans
by
the
british
cabinet
his
real
name
is
marquis
de
the
commandant
watched
the
faces
of
the
suspected
pair
who
looked
at
each
other
with
a
puzzled
expression
that
seemed
to
say
do
you
know
that
name
no
do
you
what
is
he
talking
about
he
s
the
sudden
change
in
the
manner
of
marie
de
verneuil
and
her
torpor
as
she
heard
the
name
of
the
royalist
general
was
observed
by
no
one
but
francine
the
only
person
to
whom
the
least
shade
on
that
young
face
was
visible
completely
routed
the
commandant
picked
up
the
bits
of
his
broken
sword
looked
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whose
ardent
beauty
was
beginning
to
find
its
way
to
his
heart
and
said
as
for
you
mademoiselle
i
take
nothing
back
and
these
fragments
of
my
sword
will
reach
bonaparte
unless
pooh
what
do
i
care
for
bonaparte
or
your
republic
or
the
king
or
the
gars
she
cried
scarcely
repressing
an
explosion
of
temper
a
mysterious
emotion
the
passion
of
which
gave
to
her
face
a
dazzling
color
showed
that
the
whole
world
was
nothing
to
the
girl
the
moment
that
one
individual
was
all
in
all
to
her
but
she
suddenly
subdued
herself
into
forced
calmness
observing
like
a
trained
actor
that
the
spectators
were
watching
her
the
commandant
rose
hastily
and
went
out
anxious
and
agitated
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
followed
him
stopped
him
in
the
corridor
and
said
in
an
almost
solemn
tone
have
you
any
good
reason
to
suspect
that
young
man
of
being
the
gars
god
s
thunder
mademoiselle
that
fellow
who
rode
here
with
you
came
back
to
warn
me
that
the
travellers
in
the
had
all
been
murdered
by
the
chouans
i
knew
that
but
what
i
didn
t
know
was
the
name
of
the
murdered
persons
it
was
gua
de
oh
if
corentin
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
nothing
surprises
me
she
cried
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
the
commandant
went
his
way
without
daring
to
look
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whose
dangerous
beauty
began
to
affect
him
if
i
had
stayed
two
minutes
longer
i
should
have
committed
the
folly
of
taking
back
my
sword
and
escorting
her
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
as
madame
du
gua
watched
the
young
man
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
through
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
passed
she
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
you
are
incorrigible
you
will
perish
through
a
woman
a
doll
can
make
you
forget
everything
why
did
you
allow
her
to
breakfast
with
us
who
is
a
demoiselle
de
verneuil
escorted
by
the
blues
who
accepts
a
breakfast
from
strangers
and
disarms
an
officer
with
a
piece
of
paper
hidden
in
the
bosom
of
her
gown
like
a
she
is
one
of
those
contemptible
creatures
by
whose
aid
fouche
expects
to
lay
hold
of
you
and
the
paper
she
showed
the
commandant
ordered
the
blues
to
assist
her
against
eh
madame
he
replied
in
a
sharp
tone
which
went
to
the
lady
s
heart
and
turned
her
pale
her
generous
action
disproves
your
supposition
pray
remember
that
the
welfare
of
the
king
is
the
sole
bond
between
us
you
who
have
had
charette
at
your
feet
must
find
the
world
without
him
empty
are
you
not
living
to
avenge
him
the
lady
stood
still
and
pensive
like
one
who
sees
from
the
shore
the
wreck
of
all
her
treasures
and
only
the
more
eagerly
longs
for
the
vanished
property
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
room
the
young
man
exchanged
a
smile
with
her
and
gave
her
a
glance
full
of
gentle
meaning
however
uncertain
the
future
might
seem
however
ephemeral
their
union
the
promises
of
their
sudden
love
were
only
the
more
endearing
to
them
rapid
as
the
glance
was
it
did
not
escape
the
sagacious
eye
of
madame
du
gua
who
instantly
understood
it
her
brow
clouded
and
she
was
unable
to
wholly
conceal
her
jealous
anger
francine
was
observing
her
she
saw
the
eyes
glitter
the
cheeks
flush
she
thought
she
perceived
a
diabolical
spirit
in
the
face
stirred
by
some
sudden
and
terrible
revulsion
but
lightning
is
not
more
rapid
nor
death
more
prompt
than
this
brief
exhibition
of
inward
emotion
madame
du
gua
recovered
her
lively
manner
with
such
immediate
that
francine
fancied
herself
mistaken
nevertheless
having
once
perceived
in
this
woman
a
violence
of
feeling
that
was
fully
equal
to
that
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
she
trembled
as
she
foresaw
the
clash
with
which
such
natures
might
come
together
and
the
girl
shuddered
when
she
saw
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
go
up
to
the
young
man
with
a
passionate
look
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
draw
him
close
beside
her
and
into
the
light
with
a
coquettish
glance
that
was
full
of
witchery
now
she
said
trying
to
read
his
eyes
own
to
me
that
you
are
not
the
citizen
du
gua
yes
i
am
but
he
and
his
mother
were
killed
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
he
replied
laughing
however
that
may
be
i
am
none
the
less
under
a
great
obligation
to
you
for
which
i
shall
always
feel
the
deepest
gratitude
and
only
wish
i
could
prove
it
to
i
thought
i
was
saving
an
but
i
love
you
better
as
a
the
words
escaped
her
lips
as
it
were
impulsively
she
became
confused
even
her
eyes
blushed
and
her
face
bore
no
other
expression
than
one
of
exquisite
simplicity
of
feeling
she
softly
released
the
young
man
s
hand
not
from
shame
at
having
pressed
it
but
because
of
a
thought
too
weighty
it
seemed
for
her
heart
to
bear
leaving
him
drunk
with
hope
suddenly
she
appeared
to
regret
this
freedom
permissible
as
it
might
be
under
the
passing
circumstances
of
a
journey
she
recovered
her
conventional
manner
bowed
to
the
lady
and
her
son
and
taking
francine
with
her
left
the
room
when
they
reached
their
own
chamber
francine
wrung
her
hands
and
tossed
her
arms
as
she
looked
at
her
mistress
saying
ah
marie
what
a
crowd
of
things
in
a
moment
of
time
who
but
you
would
have
such
adventures
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
sprang
forward
and
clasped
francine
round
the
neck
ah
this
is
life
indeed
i
am
in
heaven
or
hell
retorted
francine
yes
hell
if
you
like
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
here
give
me
your
hand
feel
my
heart
how
it
beats
there
s
fever
in
my
veins
the
whole
world
is
now
a
mere
nothing
to
me
how
many
times
have
i
not
seen
that
man
in
my
dreams
oh
how
beautiful
his
head
is
how
his
eyes
sparkle
will
he
love
you
said
the
simple
in
a
quivering
voice
her
face
full
of
sad
foreboding
how
can
you
ask
me
that
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
but
francine
tell
me
she
added
throwing
herself
into
a
pose
that
was
half
serious
half
comic
will
it
be
very
hard
to
love
me
no
but
will
he
love
you
always
replied
francine
smiling
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
speechless
francine
at
revealing
so
much
knowledge
of
life
and
marie
at
the
perception
which
now
came
to
her
for
the
first
time
of
a
future
of
happiness
in
her
passion
she
seemed
to
herself
hanging
over
a
gulf
of
which
she
had
wanted
to
know
the
depth
and
listening
to
the
fall
of
the
stone
she
had
flung
at
first
heedlessly
into
it
well
it
is
my
own
affair
she
said
with
the
gesture
of
a
gambler
i
should
never
pity
a
betrayed
woman
she
has
no
one
but
herself
to
blame
if
she
is
abandoned
i
shall
know
how
to
keep
either
living
or
dead
the
man
whose
heart
has
once
been
mine
but
she
added
with
some
surprise
and
after
a
moment
s
silence
where
did
you
get
your
knowledge
of
love
francine
mademoiselle
said
the
hastily
hush
i
hear
steps
in
the
ah
not
steps
said
marie
listening
but
you
are
evading
an
answer
well
well
i
ll
wait
for
it
or
guess
francine
was
right
however
three
taps
on
the
door
interrupted
the
conversation
captain
merle
appeared
after
receiving
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
permission
to
enter
with
a
military
salute
to
the
lady
whose
beauty
dazzled
him
the
soldier
ventured
on
giving
her
a
glance
but
he
found
nothing
better
to
say
than
mademoiselle
i
am
at
your
then
you
are
to
be
my
protector
in
place
of
the
commander
who
retires
is
that
so
no
my
superior
is
the
gerard
who
has
sent
me
your
commandant
must
be
very
much
afraid
of
me
she
said
beg
pardon
mademoiselle
hulot
is
afraid
of
nothing
but
women
you
see
are
not
in
his
line
it
ruffled
him
to
have
a
general
in
a
and
yet
continued
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
it
was
his
duty
to
obey
his
superiors
i
like
subordination
and
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
allow
no
one
to
disobey
that
would
be
difficult
replied
merle
gallantly
let
us
consult
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
you
can
get
fresh
troops
here
and
accompany
me
to
mayenne
which
i
must
reach
this
evening
shall
we
find
other
soldiers
there
so
that
i
might
go
on
at
once
without
stopping
at
mayenne
the
chouans
are
quite
ignorant
of
our
little
expedition
if
we
travel
at
night
we
can
avoid
meeting
any
number
of
them
and
so
escape
an
attack
do
you
think
this
feasible
yes
what
sort
of
road
is
it
between
mayenne
and
fougeres
rough
all
up
and
down
a
regular
well
let
us
start
at
once
as
we
have
nothing
to
fear
near
alencon
you
can
go
before
me
we
ll
join
you
one
would
think
she
had
seen
ten
years
service
thought
merle
as
he
departed
hulot
is
mistaken
that
young
girl
is
not
earning
her
living
out
of
a
ten
thousand
carriages
if
i
want
to
be
i
mustn
t
be
such
a
fool
as
to
mistake
for
the
during
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
conference
with
the
captain
francine
had
slipped
out
for
the
purpose
of
examining
through
a
window
of
the
corridor
the
spot
in
the
courtyard
which
had
excited
her
curiosity
on
arriving
at
the
inn
she
watched
the
stable
and
the
heaps
of
straw
with
the
absorption
of
one
who
was
saying
her
prayers
to
the
virgin
and
she
presently
saw
madame
du
gua
approaching
with
the
precaution
of
a
cat
that
dislikes
to
wet
its
feet
when
the
chouan
caught
sight
of
the
lady
he
rose
and
stood
before
her
in
an
attitude
of
deep
respect
this
singular
circumstance
aroused
francine
s
curiosity
she
slipped
into
the
courtyard
and
along
the
walls
avoiding
madame
du
gua
s
notice
and
trying
to
hide
herself
behind
the
stable
door
she
walked
on
tiptoe
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
and
succeeded
in
posting
herself
close
to
without
exciting
his
attention
if
after
all
this
information
the
lady
was
saying
to
the
chouan
it
proves
not
to
be
her
real
name
you
are
to
fire
upon
her
without
pity
as
you
would
on
a
mad
agreed
said
the
lady
left
him
the
chouan
replaced
his
red
woollen
cap
upon
his
head
remained
standing
and
was
scratching
his
ear
as
if
puzzled
when
francine
suddenly
appeared
before
him
apparently
by
magic
saint
anne
of
auray
he
exclaimed
then
he
dropped
his
whip
clasped
his
hands
and
stood
as
if
in
ecstasy
a
faint
color
illuminated
his
coarse
face
and
his
eyes
shone
like
diamonds
dropped
on
a
is
it
really
the
brave
girl
from
cottin
he
muttered
in
a
voice
so
smothered
that
he
alone
heard
it
you
fine
he
said
after
a
pause
using
the
curious
word
godaine
a
superlative
in
the
dialect
of
those
regions
used
by
lovers
to
express
the
combination
of
fine
clothes
and
beauty
i
daren
t
touch
you
added
putting
out
his
big
hand
nevertheless
as
if
to
weigh
the
gold
chain
which
hung
round
her
neck
and
below
her
waist
you
had
better
not
pierre
replied
francine
inspired
by
the
instinct
which
makes
a
woman
despotic
when
not
oppressed
she
drew
back
haughtily
after
enjoying
the
chouan
s
surprise
but
she
compensated
for
the
harshness
of
her
words
by
the
softness
of
her
glance
saying
as
she
once
more
approached
him
pierre
that
lady
was
talking
to
you
about
my
young
mistress
wasn
t
she
was
silent
his
face
struggled
like
the
dawn
between
clouds
and
light
he
looked
in
turn
at
francine
at
the
whip
he
had
dropped
and
at
the
chain
which
seemed
to
have
as
powerful
an
attraction
for
him
as
the
breton
girl
herself
then
as
if
to
put
a
stop
to
his
own
uneasiness
he
picked
up
his
whip
and
still
kept
silence
well
it
is
easy
to
see
that
that
lady
told
you
to
kill
my
mistress
resumed
francine
who
knew
the
faithful
discretion
of
the
peasant
and
wished
to
relieve
his
scruples
lowered
his
head
significantly
to
the
cottin
girl
that
was
answer
enough
very
good
pierre
she
said
if
any
evil
happens
to
her
if
a
hair
of
her
head
is
injured
you
and
i
will
have
seen
each
other
for
the
last
time
for
i
shall
be
in
heaven
and
you
will
go
to
the
possessed
of
devils
whom
the
church
in
former
days
used
to
exorcise
with
great
pomp
were
not
more
shaken
and
agitated
than
at
this
prophecy
uttered
with
a
conviction
that
gave
it
certainty
his
glance
which
at
first
had
a
character
of
savage
tenderness
counteracted
by
a
fanaticism
as
powerful
in
his
soul
as
love
suddenly
became
surly
as
he
felt
the
imperious
manner
of
the
girl
he
had
long
since
chosen
francine
interpreted
his
silence
in
her
own
way
won
t
you
do
anything
for
my
sake
she
said
in
a
tone
of
reproach
at
these
words
the
chouan
cast
a
glance
at
his
mistress
from
eyes
that
were
black
as
a
crow
s
wing
are
you
free
he
asked
in
a
growl
that
francine
alone
could
have
understood
should
i
be
here
if
i
were
not
she
replied
indignantly
but
you
what
are
you
doing
here
still
playing
bandit
still
roaming
the
country
like
a
mad
dog
wanting
to
bite
oh
pierre
if
you
were
wise
you
would
come
with
me
this
beautiful
young
lady
who
i
ought
to
tell
you
was
nursed
when
a
baby
in
our
home
has
taken
care
of
me
i
have
two
hundred
francs
a
year
from
a
good
investment
and
mademoiselle
has
bought
me
my
uncle
thomas
s
big
house
for
fifteen
hundred
francs
and
i
have
saved
two
thousand
but
her
smiles
and
the
announcement
of
her
wealth
fell
dead
before
the
dogged
immovability
of
the
chouan
the
priests
have
told
us
to
go
to
war
he
replied
every
blue
we
shoot
earns
one
but
suppose
the
blues
shoot
you
he
answered
by
letting
his
arms
drop
at
his
sides
as
if
regretting
the
poverty
of
the
offering
he
should
thus
make
to
god
and
the
king
what
will
become
of
me
exclaimed
the
young
girl
sorrowfully
looked
at
her
stupidly
his
eyes
seemed
to
enlarge
tears
rolled
down
his
hairy
cheeks
upon
the
goatskin
which
covered
him
and
a
low
moan
came
from
his
breast
saint
anne
of
auray
pierre
is
this
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
after
a
parting
of
seven
years
you
have
changed
i
love
you
the
same
as
ever
said
the
chouan
in
a
gruff
voice
no
she
whispered
the
king
is
if
you
look
at
me
like
that
i
shall
go
he
said
well
then
adieu
she
replied
sadly
adieu
he
repeated
he
seized
her
hand
wrung
it
kissed
it
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
rushed
into
the
stable
like
a
dog
who
fears
that
his
bone
will
be
taken
from
him
he
said
to
his
comrade
where
s
your
ho
what
a
fine
chain
cried
fumbling
in
a
pocket
constructed
in
his
goatskin
then
he
held
out
to
the
little
horn
in
which
bretons
put
the
finely
powdered
tobacco
which
they
prepare
themselves
during
the
long
winter
nights
the
chouan
raised
his
thumb
and
made
a
hollow
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
after
the
manner
in
which
an
invalide
takes
his
tobacco
then
he
shook
the
horn
the
small
end
of
which
had
unscrewed
a
fine
powder
fell
slowly
from
the
little
hole
pierced
in
the
point
of
this
breton
utensil
went
through
the
same
process
seven
or
eight
times
silently
as
if
the
powder
had
power
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
suddenly
he
flung
the
horn
to
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
caught
up
a
gun
which
was
hidden
in
the
straw
seven
or
eight
shakes
at
once
i
suppose
you
think
that
costs
nothing
said
the
stingy
forward
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
there
s
work
before
thirty
or
more
chouans
who
were
sleeping
in
the
straw
under
the
mangers
raised
their
heads
saw
on
his
feet
and
disappeared
instantly
through
a
door
which
led
to
the
garden
from
which
it
was
easy
to
reach
the
fields
when
francine
left
the
stable
she
found
the
ready
to
start
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
her
new
were
already
in
it
the
girl
shuddered
as
she
saw
her
young
mistress
sitting
side
by
side
with
the
woman
who
had
just
ordered
her
death
the
young
man
had
taken
his
seat
facing
marie
and
as
soon
as
francine
was
in
hers
the
heavy
vehicle
started
at
a
good
pace
the
sun
had
swept
away
the
gray
autumnal
mists
and
its
rays
were
brightening
the
gloomy
landscape
with
a
look
of
youth
and
holiday
many
lovers
fancy
that
such
chance
accidents
of
the
sky
are
premonitions
francine
was
surprised
at
the
strange
silence
which
fell
upon
the
travellers
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
recovered
her
cold
manner
and
sat
with
her
eyes
lowered
her
head
slightly
inclined
and
her
hands
hidden
under
a
sort
of
mantle
in
which
she
had
wrapped
herself
if
she
raised
her
eyes
it
was
only
to
look
at
the
passing
scenery
certain
of
being
admired
she
rejected
admiration
but
her
apparent
indifference
was
evidently
more
coquettish
than
natural
purity
which
gives
such
harmony
to
the
diverse
expressions
by
which
a
simple
soul
reveals
itself
could
lend
no
charm
to
a
being
whose
every
instinct
predestined
her
to
the
storms
of
passion
yielding
himself
up
to
the
pleasures
of
this
dawning
intrigue
the
young
man
did
not
try
to
explain
the
contradictions
which
were
obvious
between
the
coquetry
and
the
enthusiasm
of
this
singular
young
girl
her
assumed
indifference
allowed
him
to
examine
at
his
ease
a
face
which
was
now
as
beautiful
in
its
calmness
as
it
had
been
when
agitated
like
the
rest
of
us
he
was
not
disposed
to
question
the
sources
of
his
enjoyment
it
is
difficult
for
a
pretty
woman
to
avoid
the
glances
of
her
companions
in
a
carriage
when
their
eyes
fasten
upon
her
as
a
visible
distraction
to
the
monotony
of
a
journey
happy
therefore
in
being
able
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
his
dawning
passion
without
offence
or
avoidance
on
the
part
of
its
object
the
young
man
studied
the
pure
and
brilliant
lines
of
the
girl
s
head
and
face
to
him
they
were
a
picture
sometimes
the
light
brought
out
the
transparent
rose
of
the
nostrils
and
the
double
curve
which
united
the
nose
with
the
upper
lip
at
other
times
a
pale
glint
of
sunshine
illuminated
the
tints
of
the
skin
pearly
beneath
the
eyes
and
round
the
mouth
rosy
on
the
cheeks
and
about
the
temples
and
throat
he
admired
the
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
caused
by
the
masses
of
black
hair
surrounding
her
face
and
giving
it
an
ephemeral
grace
for
all
is
fleeting
in
a
woman
her
beauty
of
is
often
not
that
of
yesterday
fortunately
for
herself
perhaps
the
young
man
who
was
still
at
an
age
when
youth
delights
in
the
nothings
which
are
the
all
of
love
watched
eagerly
for
each
movement
of
the
eyelids
and
the
seductive
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
as
she
breathed
sometimes
he
fancied
suiting
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
that
he
could
see
a
meaning
in
the
expression
of
the
eyes
and
the
imperceptible
inflection
of
the
lips
every
gesture
betrayed
to
him
the
soul
every
motion
a
new
aspect
of
the
young
girl
if
a
thought
stirred
those
mobile
features
if
a
sudden
blush
suffused
the
cheeks
or
a
smile
brought
life
into
the
face
he
found
a
fresh
delight
in
trying
to
discover
the
secrets
of
this
mysterious
creature
everything
about
her
was
a
snare
to
the
soul
and
a
snare
to
the
senses
even
the
silence
that
fell
between
them
far
from
raising
an
obstacle
to
the
understanding
of
their
hearts
became
the
common
ground
for
mutual
thoughts
but
after
a
while
the
many
looks
in
which
their
eyes
encountered
each
other
warned
marie
de
verneuil
that
the
silence
was
compromising
her
and
she
turned
to
madame
du
gua
with
one
of
those
commonplace
remarks
which
open
the
way
to
conversation
but
even
in
so
doing
she
included
the
young
man
madame
she
said
how
could
you
put
your
son
into
the
navy
have
you
not
doomed
yourself
to
perpetual
anxiety
mademoiselle
the
fate
of
women
of
mothers
i
should
say
is
to
tremble
for
the
safety
of
their
dear
your
son
is
very
like
do
you
think
so
mademoiselle
the
smile
with
which
the
young
man
listened
to
these
remarks
increased
the
vexation
of
his
pretended
mother
her
hatred
grew
with
every
passionate
glance
he
turned
on
marie
silence
or
conversation
all
increased
the
dreadful
wrath
which
she
carefully
concealed
beneath
a
cordial
manner
mademoiselle
said
the
young
man
you
are
quite
mistaken
naval
men
are
not
more
exposed
to
danger
than
soldiers
women
ought
not
to
dislike
the
navy
we
sailors
have
a
merit
beyond
that
of
the
military
we
are
faithful
to
our
oh
from
necessity
replied
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
laughing
but
even
so
it
is
fidelity
said
madame
du
gua
in
a
deep
voice
the
conversation
grew
lively
touching
upon
subjects
that
were
interesting
to
none
but
the
three
travellers
for
under
such
circumstances
intelligent
persons
given
new
meanings
to
commonplace
talk
but
every
word
insignificant
as
it
might
seem
was
a
mutual
interrogation
hiding
the
desires
hopes
and
passions
which
agitated
them
marie
s
cleverness
and
quick
perception
for
she
was
fully
on
her
guard
showed
madame
du
gua
that
calumny
and
treachery
could
alone
avail
to
triumph
over
a
rival
as
formidable
through
her
intellect
as
by
her
beauty
the
presently
overtook
the
escort
and
then
advanced
more
slowly
the
young
man
seeing
a
long
hill
before
them
proposed
to
the
young
lady
that
they
should
walk
the
friendly
politeness
of
his
offer
decided
her
and
her
consent
flattered
him
is
madame
of
our
opinion
she
said
turning
to
madame
du
gua
will
she
walk
too
coquette
said
the
lady
to
herself
as
she
left
the
coach
marie
and
the
young
man
walked
together
but
a
little
apart
the
sailor
full
of
ardent
desires
was
determined
to
break
the
reserve
that
checked
him
of
which
however
he
was
not
the
dupe
he
fancied
that
he
could
succeed
by
dallying
with
the
young
lady
in
that
tone
of
courteous
amiability
and
wit
sometimes
frivolous
sometimes
serious
which
characterized
the
men
of
the
exiled
aristocracy
but
the
smiling
parisian
beauty
parried
him
so
mischievously
and
rejected
his
frivolities
with
such
disdain
evidently
preferring
the
stronger
ideas
and
enthusiasms
which
he
betrayed
from
time
to
time
in
spite
of
himself
that
he
presently
began
to
understand
the
true
way
of
pleasing
her
the
conversation
then
changed
he
realized
the
hopes
her
expressive
face
had
given
him
yet
as
he
did
so
new
difficulties
arose
and
he
was
still
forced
to
suspend
his
judgment
on
a
girl
who
seemed
to
take
delight
in
thwarting
him
a
siren
with
whom
he
grew
more
and
more
in
love
after
yielding
to
the
seduction
of
her
beauty
he
was
still
more
attracted
to
her
mysterious
soul
with
a
curiosity
which
marie
perceived
and
took
pleasure
in
exciting
their
intercourse
assumed
insensibly
a
character
of
intimacy
far
removed
from
the
tone
of
indifference
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
endeavored
in
vain
to
give
to
it
though
madame
du
gua
had
followed
the
lovers
the
latter
had
unconsciously
walked
so
much
more
rapidly
than
she
that
a
distance
of
several
hundred
feet
soon
separated
them
the
charming
pair
trod
the
fine
sand
beneath
their
feet
listening
with
childlike
delight
to
the
union
of
their
footsteps
happy
in
being
wrapped
by
the
same
ray
of
a
sunshine
that
seemed
in
breathing
with
the
same
breath
autumnal
perfumes
laden
with
vegetable
odors
which
seemed
a
nourishment
brought
by
the
breezes
to
their
dawning
love
though
to
them
it
may
have
been
a
mere
circumstance
of
their
fortuitous
meeting
yet
the
sky
the
landscape
the
season
of
the
year
did
communicate
to
their
emotions
a
tinge
of
melancholy
gravity
which
gave
them
an
element
of
passion
they
praised
the
weather
and
talked
of
its
beauty
then
of
their
strange
encounter
of
the
coming
rupture
of
an
intercourse
so
delightful
of
the
ease
with
which
in
travelling
friendships
lost
as
soon
as
made
are
formed
after
this
last
remark
the
young
man
profited
by
what
seemed
to
be
a
tacit
permission
to
make
a
few
tender
confidences
and
to
risk
an
avowal
of
love
like
a
man
who
was
not
unaccustomed
to
such
situations
have
you
noticed
mademoiselle
he
said
how
little
the
feelings
of
the
heart
follow
the
old
conventional
rules
in
the
days
of
terror
in
which
we
live
everything
about
us
bears
the
stamp
of
suddenness
we
love
in
a
day
or
we
hate
on
the
strength
of
a
single
glance
we
are
bound
to
each
other
for
life
in
a
moment
or
we
part
with
the
celerity
of
death
itself
all
things
are
hurried
like
the
convulsions
of
the
nation
in
the
midst
of
such
dangers
as
ours
the
ties
that
bind
should
be
stronger
than
under
the
ordinary
course
of
life
in
paris
during
the
terror
every
one
came
to
know
the
full
meaning
of
a
clasp
of
the
hand
as
men
do
on
a
people
felt
the
necessity
of
living
fast
and
ardently
she
answered
for
they
had
little
time
to
then
with
a
glance
at
her
companion
which
seemed
to
tell
him
that
the
end
of
their
short
intercourse
was
approaching
she
added
maliciously
you
are
very
well
informed
as
to
the
affairs
of
life
for
a
young
man
who
has
just
left
the
ecole
polytechnique
what
are
you
thinking
of
me
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
tell
me
frankly
without
you
wish
to
acquire
the
right
to
speak
to
me
of
myself
she
said
laughing
you
do
not
answer
me
he
went
on
after
a
slight
pause
take
care
silence
is
sometimes
do
you
think
i
can
not
guess
all
that
you
would
like
to
say
to
me
good
heavens
you
have
already
said
oh
if
we
understand
each
other
he
replied
smiling
i
have
obtained
more
than
i
dared
hope
she
smiled
in
return
so
graciously
that
she
seemed
to
accept
the
courteous
struggle
into
which
all
men
like
to
draw
a
woman
they
persuaded
themselves
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
that
they
never
could
be
more
to
each
other
than
they
were
at
that
moment
the
young
man
fancied
therefore
he
might
give
reins
to
a
passion
that
could
have
no
future
the
young
woman
felt
she
might
smile
upon
it
marie
suddenly
struck
her
foot
against
a
stone
and
stumbled
take
my
arm
said
her
companion
it
seems
i
must
she
replied
you
would
be
too
proud
if
i
refused
you
would
fancy
i
feared
ah
mademoiselle
he
said
pressing
her
arm
against
his
heart
that
she
might
feel
the
beating
of
it
you
flatter
my
pride
by
granting
such
a
well
the
readiness
with
which
i
do
so
will
cure
your
do
you
wish
to
save
me
from
the
danger
of
the
emotions
you
cause
stop
stop
she
cried
do
not
try
to
entangle
me
in
such
boudoir
riddles
i
don
t
like
to
find
the
wit
of
fools
in
a
man
of
your
character
see
here
we
are
beneath
the
glorious
sky
in
the
open
country
before
us
above
us
all
is
grand
you
wish
to
tell
me
that
i
am
beautiful
do
you
not
well
your
eyes
have
already
told
me
so
besides
i
know
it
i
am
not
a
woman
whom
mere
compliments
can
please
but
perhaps
you
would
like
this
with
satirical
emphasis
to
talk
about
your
do
you
think
me
so
simple
as
to
believe
that
sudden
sympathies
are
powerful
enough
to
influence
a
whole
life
through
the
recollections
of
one
morning
not
the
recollections
of
a
morning
he
said
but
those
of
a
beautiful
woman
who
has
shown
herself
you
forget
she
retorted
laughing
half
my
attractions
a
mysterious
woman
with
everything
odd
about
her
name
rank
situation
freedom
of
thought
and
you
are
not
mysterious
to
me
he
exclaimed
i
have
fathomed
you
there
is
nothing
that
could
be
added
to
your
perfections
except
a
little
more
faith
in
the
love
you
ah
my
poor
child
of
eighteen
what
can
you
know
of
love
she
said
smiling
well
well
so
be
it
she
added
it
is
a
fair
subject
of
conversation
like
the
weather
when
one
pays
a
visit
you
shall
find
that
i
have
neither
false
modesty
nor
petty
fears
i
can
hear
the
word
love
without
blushing
it
has
been
so
often
said
to
me
without
one
echo
of
the
heart
that
i
think
it
quite
unmeaning
i
have
met
with
it
everywhere
in
books
at
the
theatre
in
society
yes
everywhere
and
never
have
i
found
in
it
even
a
semblance
of
its
magnificent
did
you
seek
that
ideal
the
word
was
said
with
such
perfect
ease
and
freedom
that
the
young
man
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
looked
at
marie
fixedly
as
if
he
had
suddenly
changed
his
opinion
on
her
character
and
real
position
mademoiselle
he
said
with
devotion
are
you
maid
or
wife
angel
or
devil
all
she
replied
laughing
isn
t
there
something
diabolic
and
also
angelic
in
a
young
girl
who
has
never
loved
does
not
love
and
perhaps
will
never
love
do
you
think
yourself
happy
thus
he
asked
with
a
free
and
easy
tone
and
manner
as
though
already
he
felt
less
respect
for
her
oh
happy
no
she
replied
when
i
think
that
i
am
alone
hampered
by
social
conventions
that
make
me
deceitful
i
envy
the
privileges
of
a
man
but
when
i
also
reflect
on
the
means
which
nature
has
bestowed
on
us
women
to
catch
and
entangle
you
men
in
the
invisible
meshes
of
a
power
which
you
can
not
resist
then
the
part
assigned
to
me
in
the
world
is
not
displeasing
to
me
and
then
again
suddenly
it
does
seem
very
petty
and
i
feel
that
i
should
despise
a
man
who
allowed
himself
to
be
duped
by
such
vulgar
seductions
no
sooner
do
i
perceive
our
power
and
like
it
than
i
know
it
to
be
horrible
and
i
abhor
it
sometimes
i
feel
within
me
that
longing
towards
devotion
which
makes
my
sex
so
nobly
beautiful
and
then
i
feel
a
desire
which
consumes
me
for
dominion
and
power
perhaps
it
is
the
natural
struggle
of
the
good
and
the
evil
principle
in
which
all
creatures
live
here
below
angel
or
devil
you
have
expressed
it
ah
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
recognized
my
double
nature
but
we
women
understand
better
than
you
men
can
do
our
own
shortcomings
we
have
an
instinct
which
shows
us
a
perfection
in
all
things
to
which
nevertheless
we
fail
to
attain
but
she
added
sighing
as
she
glanced
at
the
sky
that
which
enhances
us
in
your
eyes
is
is
what
he
said
that
we
are
all
struggling
more
or
less
she
answered
against
a
thwarted
mademoiselle
why
should
we
part
ah
she
replied
smiling
at
the
passionate
look
which
he
gave
her
let
us
get
into
the
carriage
the
open
air
does
not
agree
with
marie
turned
abruptly
the
young
man
followed
her
and
pressed
her
arm
with
little
respect
but
in
a
manner
that
expressed
his
imperious
admiration
she
hastened
her
steps
seeing
that
she
wished
to
escape
an
importune
declaration
he
became
the
more
ardent
being
determined
to
win
a
first
favor
from
this
woman
he
risked
all
and
said
looking
at
her
meaningly
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
yes
quickly
if
it
concerns
i
am
not
in
the
service
of
the
republic
where
are
you
going
i
shall
follow
at
the
words
marie
trembled
violently
she
withdrew
her
arm
and
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
to
hide
either
the
flush
or
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
then
she
suddenly
uncovered
her
face
and
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
then
you
began
as
you
would
have
ended
by
deceiving
me
yes
he
said
at
this
answer
she
turned
again
from
the
carriage
which
was
now
overtaking
them
and
began
to
almost
run
along
the
road
i
thought
he
said
following
her
that
the
open
air
did
not
agree
with
you
oh
it
has
changed
she
replied
in
a
grave
tone
continuing
to
walk
on
a
prey
to
agitating
thoughts
you
do
not
answer
me
said
the
young
man
his
heart
full
of
the
soft
expectation
of
coming
pleasure
oh
she
said
in
a
strained
voice
the
tragedy
what
tragedy
he
asked
she
stopped
short
looked
at
the
young
student
from
head
to
foot
with
a
mingled
expression
of
fear
and
curiosity
then
she
concealed
her
feelings
that
were
agitating
her
under
the
mask
of
an
impenetrable
calmness
showing
that
for
a
girl
of
her
age
she
had
great
experience
of
life
who
are
you
she
said
but
i
know
already
when
i
first
saw
you
i
suspected
it
you
are
the
royalist
leader
whom
they
call
the
gars
the
of
autun
was
right
in
saying
we
should
always
believe
in
presentiments
which
give
warning
of
what
interest
have
you
in
knowing
the
gars
what
interest
has
he
in
concealing
himself
from
me
who
have
already
saved
his
life
she
began
to
laugh
but
the
merriment
was
forced
i
have
wisely
prevented
you
from
saying
that
you
love
me
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
that
i
abhor
you
i
am
republican
you
are
royalist
i
would
deliver
you
up
if
you
were
not
under
my
protection
and
if
i
had
not
already
saved
your
life
and
if
she
stopped
these
violent
extremes
of
feeling
and
the
inward
struggle
which
she
no
longer
attempted
to
conceal
alarmed
the
young
man
who
tried
but
in
vain
to
observe
her
calmly
let
us
part
here
at
once
i
insist
upon
it
farewell
she
said
she
turned
hastily
back
made
a
few
steps
and
then
returned
to
him
no
no
she
continued
i
have
too
great
an
interest
in
knowing
who
you
are
hide
nothing
from
me
tell
me
the
truth
who
are
you
for
you
are
no
more
a
pupil
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
than
you
are
eighteen
years
i
am
a
sailor
ready
to
leave
the
ocean
and
follow
you
wherever
your
imagination
may
lead
you
if
i
have
been
so
lucky
as
to
rouse
your
curiosity
in
any
particular
i
shall
be
very
careful
not
to
lessen
it
why
mingle
the
serious
affairs
of
real
life
with
the
life
of
the
heart
in
which
we
are
beginning
to
understand
each
other
our
souls
might
have
understood
each
other
she
said
in
a
grave
voice
but
i
have
no
right
to
exact
your
confidence
you
will
never
know
the
extent
of
your
obligations
to
me
i
shall
not
explain
they
walked
a
few
steps
in
silence
my
life
does
interest
you
said
the
young
man
monsieur
i
implore
you
tell
me
your
name
or
else
be
silent
you
are
a
child
she
added
with
an
impatient
movement
of
her
shoulders
and
i
feel
a
pity
for
the
obstinacy
with
which
she
insisted
on
knowing
his
name
made
the
pretended
sailor
hesitate
between
prudence
and
love
the
vexation
of
a
desired
woman
is
powerfully
attractive
her
anger
like
her
submission
is
imperious
many
are
the
fibres
she
touches
in
a
man
s
heart
penetrating
and
subjugating
it
was
this
scene
only
another
aspect
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
coquetry
in
spite
of
his
sudden
passion
the
unnamed
lover
had
the
strength
to
distrust
a
woman
thus
bent
on
forcing
from
him
a
secret
of
life
and
death
why
has
my
rash
indiscretion
which
sought
to
give
a
future
to
our
present
meeting
destroyed
the
happiness
of
it
he
said
taking
her
hand
which
she
left
in
his
unconsciously
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
seemed
to
be
in
real
distress
was
silent
how
have
i
displeased
you
he
said
what
can
i
do
to
soothe
you
tell
me
your
he
made
no
reply
and
they
walked
some
distance
in
silence
suddenly
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
stopped
short
like
one
who
has
come
to
some
serious
determination
monsieur
le
marquis
de
montauran
she
said
with
dignity
but
without
being
able
to
conceal
entirely
the
nervous
trembling
of
her
features
i
desire
to
do
you
a
great
service
whatever
it
may
cost
me
we
part
here
the
coach
and
its
escort
are
necessary
for
your
protection
and
you
must
continue
your
journey
in
it
fear
nothing
from
the
republicans
they
are
men
of
honor
and
i
shall
give
the
adjutant
certain
orders
which
he
will
faithfully
execute
as
for
me
i
shall
return
on
foot
to
alencon
with
my
maid
and
take
a
few
of
the
soldiers
with
me
listen
to
what
i
say
for
your
life
depends
on
it
if
before
you
reach
a
place
of
safety
you
meet
that
odious
man
you
saw
in
my
company
at
the
inn
escape
at
once
for
he
will
instantly
betray
you
as
for
me
she
paused
as
for
me
i
fling
myself
back
into
the
miseries
of
life
farewell
monsieur
may
you
be
happy
she
made
a
sign
to
captain
merle
who
was
just
then
reaching
the
brow
of
the
hill
behind
her
the
marquis
was
taken
unawares
by
her
sudden
action
stop
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
despair
that
was
well
acted
this
singular
caprice
of
a
girl
for
whom
he
would
at
that
instant
have
thrown
away
his
life
so
surprised
him
that
he
invented
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
fatal
fiction
by
which
to
hide
his
name
and
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
his
companion
you
have
almost
guessed
the
truth
he
said
i
am
an
condemned
to
death
and
my
name
is
vicomte
de
bauvan
love
of
my
country
has
brought
me
back
to
france
to
join
my
brother
i
hope
to
be
taken
off
the
list
of
through
the
influence
of
madame
de
beauharnais
now
the
wife
of
the
first
consul
but
if
i
fail
in
this
i
mean
to
die
on
the
soil
of
my
native
land
fighting
beside
my
friend
montauran
i
am
now
on
my
way
secretly
by
means
of
a
passport
he
has
sent
me
to
learn
if
any
of
my
property
in
brittany
is
still
while
the
young
man
spoke
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
examined
him
with
a
penetrating
eye
she
tried
at
first
to
doubt
his
words
but
being
by
nature
confiding
and
trustful
she
slowly
regained
an
expression
of
serenity
and
said
eagerly
monsieur
are
you
telling
me
the
exact
truth
yes
the
exact
truth
replied
the
young
man
who
seemed
to
have
no
conscience
in
his
dealings
with
women
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
gave
a
deep
sigh
like
a
person
who
returns
to
life
ah
she
exclaimed
i
am
very
then
you
hate
that
poor
montauran
no
she
said
but
i
could
not
make
you
understand
my
meaning
i
was
not
willing
that
should
meet
the
dangers
from
which
i
will
try
to
protect
him
since
he
is
your
who
told
you
that
montauran
was
in
danger
ah
monsieur
even
if
i
had
not
come
from
paris
where
his
enterprise
is
the
one
thing
talked
of
the
commandant
at
alencon
said
enough
to
show
his
then
let
me
ask
you
how
you
expect
to
save
him
from
suppose
i
do
not
choose
to
answer
she
replied
with
the
haughty
air
that
women
often
assume
to
hide
an
emotion
what
right
have
you
to
know
my
secrets
the
right
of
a
man
who
loves
already
she
said
no
you
do
not
love
me
i
am
only
an
object
of
passing
gallantry
to
you
that
is
all
i
am
did
i
not
penetrate
your
disguise
at
once
a
woman
who
knows
anything
of
good
society
could
not
be
misled
in
these
days
by
a
pupil
of
the
polytechnique
who
uses
choice
language
and
conceals
as
little
as
you
do
the
manners
of
a
under
the
mask
of
a
republican
there
is
a
trifle
of
powder
left
in
your
hair
and
a
fragrance
of
nobility
clings
to
you
which
a
woman
of
the
world
can
not
fail
to
detect
therefore
fearing
that
the
man
whom
you
saw
accompanying
me
who
has
all
the
shrewdness
of
a
woman
might
make
the
same
discovery
i
sent
him
away
monsieur
let
me
tell
you
that
a
true
republican
officer
just
from
the
polytechnique
would
not
have
made
love
to
me
as
you
have
done
and
would
not
have
taken
me
for
a
pretty
adventuress
allow
me
monsieur
de
bauvan
to
preach
you
a
little
sermon
from
a
woman
s
point
of
view
are
you
too
juvenile
to
know
that
of
all
the
creatures
of
my
sex
the
most
difficult
to
subdue
is
that
same
adventuress
she
whose
price
is
ticketed
and
who
is
weary
of
pleasure
that
sort
of
woman
requires
they
tell
me
constant
seduction
she
yields
only
to
her
own
caprices
any
attempt
to
please
her
argues
i
should
suppose
great
conceit
on
the
part
of
a
man
but
let
us
put
aside
that
class
of
women
among
whom
you
have
been
good
enough
to
rank
me
you
ought
to
understand
that
a
young
woman
handsome
brilliant
and
of
noble
birth
for
i
suppose
you
will
grant
me
those
advantages
does
not
sell
herself
and
can
only
be
won
by
the
man
who
loves
her
in
one
way
you
understand
me
if
she
loves
him
and
is
willing
to
commit
a
folly
she
must
be
justified
by
great
and
heroic
reasons
forgive
me
this
logic
rare
in
my
sex
but
for
the
sake
of
your
happiness
and
my
own
she
added
dropping
her
head
i
will
not
allow
either
of
us
to
deceive
the
other
nor
will
i
permit
you
to
think
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
angel
or
devil
maid
or
wife
is
capable
of
being
seduced
by
commonplace
mademoiselle
said
the
marquis
whose
surprise
though
he
concealed
it
was
extreme
and
who
at
once
became
a
man
of
the
great
world
i
entreat
you
to
believe
that
i
take
you
to
be
a
very
noble
person
full
of
the
highest
sentiments
or
a
charming
girl
as
you
i
don
t
ask
all
that
she
said
laughing
allow
me
to
keep
my
incognito
my
mask
is
better
than
yours
and
it
pleases
me
to
wear
it
if
only
to
discover
whether
those
who
talk
to
me
of
love
are
sincere
therefore
beware
of
me
monsieur
she
cried
catching
his
arm
vehemently
listen
to
me
if
you
were
able
to
prove
that
your
love
is
true
nothing
no
human
power
could
part
us
yes
i
would
fain
unite
myself
to
the
noble
destiny
of
some
great
man
and
marry
a
vast
ambition
glorious
hopes
noble
hearts
are
never
faithless
for
constancy
is
in
their
fibre
i
should
be
forever
loved
forever
happy
i
would
make
my
body
a
by
which
to
raise
the
man
who
loved
me
i
would
sacrifice
all
things
to
him
bear
all
things
from
him
and
love
him
forever
even
if
he
ceased
to
love
me
i
have
never
before
dared
to
confess
to
another
heart
the
secrets
of
mine
nor
the
passionate
enthusiasms
which
exhaust
me
but
i
tell
you
something
of
them
now
because
as
soon
as
i
have
seen
you
in
safety
we
shall
part
part
never
he
cried
electrified
by
the
tones
of
that
vigorous
soul
which
seemed
to
be
fighting
against
some
overwhelming
thought
are
you
free
she
said
with
a
haughty
glance
which
subdued
him
free
yes
except
for
the
sentence
of
death
which
hangs
over
she
added
presently
in
a
voice
full
of
bitter
feeling
if
all
this
were
not
a
dream
a
glorious
life
might
indeed
be
ours
but
i
have
been
talking
folly
let
us
beware
of
committing
any
when
i
think
of
all
you
would
have
to
be
before
you
could
rate
me
at
my
proper
value
i
doubt
everything
i
doubt
nothing
if
you
will
only
grant
me
hush
she
cried
hearing
a
note
of
true
passion
in
his
voice
the
open
air
is
decidedly
disagreeing
with
us
let
us
return
to
the
that
vehicle
soon
came
up
they
took
their
places
and
drove
on
several
miles
in
total
silence
both
had
matter
for
reflection
but
henceforth
their
eyes
no
longer
feared
to
meet
each
now
seemed
to
have
an
equal
interest
in
observing
the
other
and
in
mutually
hiding
important
secrets
but
for
all
that
they
were
drawn
together
by
one
and
the
same
impulse
which
now
as
a
result
of
this
interview
assumed
the
dimensions
of
a
passion
they
recognized
in
each
other
qualities
which
promised
to
heighten
all
the
pleasures
to
be
derived
from
either
their
contest
or
their
union
perhaps
both
of
them
living
a
life
of
adventure
had
reached
the
singular
moral
condition
in
which
either
from
weariness
or
in
defiance
of
fate
the
mind
rejects
serious
reflection
and
flings
itself
on
chance
in
pursuing
an
enterprise
precisely
because
the
issues
of
chance
are
unknown
and
the
interest
of
expecting
them
vivid
the
moral
nature
like
the
physical
nature
has
its
abysses
into
which
strong
souls
love
to
plunge
risking
their
future
as
gamblers
risk
their
fortune
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
the
young
marquis
had
obtained
a
revelation
of
each
other
s
minds
as
a
consequence
of
this
interview
and
their
intercourse
thus
took
rapid
strides
for
the
sympathy
of
their
souls
succeeded
to
that
of
their
senses
besides
the
more
they
felt
fatally
drawn
to
each
other
the
more
eager
they
were
to
study
the
secret
action
of
their
minds
the
vicomte
de
bauvan
surprised
at
the
seriousness
of
the
strange
girl
s
ideas
asked
himself
how
she
could
possibly
combine
such
acquired
knowledge
of
life
with
so
much
youth
and
freshness
he
thought
he
discovered
an
extreme
desire
to
appear
chaste
in
the
modesty
and
reserve
of
her
attitudes
he
suspected
her
of
playing
a
part
he
questioned
the
nature
of
his
own
pleasure
and
ended
by
choosing
to
consider
her
a
clever
actress
he
was
right
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
like
other
women
of
the
world
grew
the
more
reserved
the
more
she
felt
the
warmth
of
her
own
feelings
assuming
with
perfect
naturalness
the
appearance
of
prudery
beneath
which
such
women
veil
their
desires
they
all
wish
to
offer
themselves
as
virgins
on
love
s
altar
and
if
they
are
not
so
the
deception
they
seek
to
practise
is
at
least
a
homage
which
they
pay
to
their
lovers
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
the
mind
of
the
young
man
and
gratified
him
in
fact
for
both
this
mutual
examination
was
an
advance
in
their
intercourse
and
the
lover
soon
came
to
that
phase
of
passion
in
which
a
man
finds
in
the
defects
of
his
mistress
a
reason
for
loving
her
the
more
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
thoughtful
perhaps
her
imagination
led
her
over
a
greater
extent
of
the
future
than
that
of
the
young
who
was
merely
following
one
of
the
many
impulses
of
his
life
as
a
man
whereas
marie
was
considering
a
lifetime
thinking
to
make
it
beautiful
and
to
fill
it
with
happiness
and
with
grand
and
noble
sentiments
happy
in
such
thoughts
more
in
love
with
her
ideal
than
with
the
actual
reality
with
the
future
rather
than
with
the
present
she
desired
now
to
return
upon
her
steps
so
as
to
better
establish
her
power
in
this
she
acted
instinctively
as
all
women
act
having
agreed
with
her
soul
that
she
would
give
herself
wholly
up
she
wished
if
we
may
so
express
it
to
dispute
every
fragment
of
the
gift
she
longed
to
take
back
from
the
past
all
her
words
and
looks
and
acts
and
make
them
more
in
harmony
with
the
dignity
of
a
woman
beloved
her
eyes
at
times
expressed
a
sort
of
terror
as
she
thought
of
the
interview
just
over
in
which
she
had
shown
herself
aggressive
but
as
she
watched
the
face
before
her
instinct
with
power
and
felt
that
a
being
so
strong
must
also
be
generous
she
glowed
at
the
thought
that
her
part
in
life
would
be
nobler
than
that
of
most
women
inasmuch
as
her
lover
was
a
man
of
character
a
man
condemned
to
death
who
had
come
to
risk
his
life
in
making
war
against
the
republic
the
thought
of
occupying
such
a
soul
to
the
exclusion
of
all
rivals
gave
a
new
aspect
to
many
matters
between
the
moment
only
five
hours
earlier
when
she
composed
her
face
and
toned
her
voice
to
allure
the
young
man
and
the
present
moment
when
she
was
able
to
convulse
him
with
a
look
there
was
all
the
difference
to
her
between
a
dead
world
and
a
living
one
in
the
condition
of
soul
in
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
now
existed
external
life
seemed
to
her
a
species
of
phantasmagoria
the
carriage
passed
through
villages
and
valleys
and
mounted
hills
which
left
no
impressions
on
her
mind
they
reached
mayenne
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
were
changed
merle
spoke
to
her
she
replied
they
crossed
the
whole
town
and
were
again
in
the
open
country
but
the
faces
houses
streets
landscape
men
swept
past
her
like
the
figments
of
a
dream
night
came
and
marie
was
travelling
beneath
a
diamond
sky
wrapped
in
soft
light
and
yet
she
was
not
aware
that
darkness
had
succeeded
day
that
mayenne
was
passed
that
fougeres
was
near
she
knew
not
even
where
she
was
going
that
she
should
part
in
a
few
hours
from
the
man
she
had
chosen
and
who
she
believed
had
chosen
her
was
not
for
her
a
possibility
love
is
the
only
passion
which
looks
to
neither
past
nor
future
occasionally
her
thoughts
escaped
in
broken
words
in
phrases
devoid
of
meaning
though
to
her
lover
s
ears
they
sounded
like
promises
of
love
to
the
two
witnesses
of
this
birth
of
passion
she
seemed
to
be
rushing
onward
with
fearful
rapidity
francine
knew
marie
as
well
as
madame
du
gua
knew
the
marquis
and
their
experience
of
the
past
made
them
await
in
silence
some
terrible
finale
it
was
indeed
not
long
before
the
end
came
to
the
drama
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
called
without
perhaps
imagining
the
truth
of
her
words
a
tragedy
when
the
travellers
were
about
three
miles
beyond
mayenne
they
heard
a
horseman
riding
after
them
with
great
rapidity
when
he
reached
the
carriage
he
leaned
towards
it
to
look
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
recognized
corentin
that
offensive
personage
made
her
a
sign
of
intelligence
the
familiarity
of
which
was
deeply
mortifying
then
he
turned
away
after
chilling
her
to
the
bone
with
a
look
full
of
some
base
meaning
the
young
seemed
painfully
affected
by
this
circumstance
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
his
pretended
mother
but
marie
softly
touched
him
seeming
by
her
eyes
to
take
refuge
in
his
heart
as
thought
it
were
her
only
haven
his
brow
cleared
at
this
proof
of
the
full
extent
of
his
mistress
s
attachment
coming
to
him
as
it
were
by
accident
an
inexplicable
fear
seemed
to
have
overcome
her
coyness
and
her
love
was
visible
for
a
moment
without
a
veil
unfortunately
for
both
of
them
madame
du
gua
saw
it
all
like
a
miser
who
gives
a
feast
she
seemed
to
count
the
morsels
and
begrudge
the
wine
absorbed
in
their
happiness
the
lovers
arrived
without
any
consciousness
of
the
distance
they
had
traversed
at
that
part
of
the
road
which
passed
through
the
valley
of
ernee
there
francine
noticed
and
showed
to
her
companions
a
number
of
strange
forms
which
seemed
to
move
like
shadows
among
the
trees
and
gorse
that
surrounded
the
fields
when
the
carriage
came
within
range
of
these
shadows
a
volley
of
musketry
the
balls
of
which
whistled
above
their
heads
warned
the
travellers
that
the
shadows
were
realities
the
escort
had
fallen
into
a
trap
captain
merle
now
keenly
regretted
having
adopted
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
idea
that
a
rapid
journey
by
night
would
be
a
safe
one
an
error
which
had
led
him
to
reduce
his
escort
from
mayenne
to
sixty
men
he
at
once
under
gerard
s
orders
divided
his
little
troop
into
two
columns
one
on
each
side
of
the
road
which
the
two
officers
marched
at
a
quick
step
among
the
gorse
hedges
eager
to
meet
the
assailants
though
ignorant
of
their
number
the
blues
beat
the
thick
bushes
right
and
left
with
rash
intrepidity
and
replied
to
the
chouans
with
a
steady
fire
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
first
impulse
was
to
jump
from
the
carriage
and
run
back
along
the
road
until
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
battle
but
ashamed
of
her
fears
and
moved
by
the
feeling
which
impels
us
all
to
act
nobly
under
the
eyes
of
those
we
love
she
presently
stood
still
endeavoring
to
watch
the
combat
coolly
the
marquis
followed
her
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
on
his
breast
i
was
afraid
she
said
smiling
but
now
just
then
her
terrified
maid
cried
out
marie
take
care
but
as
she
said
the
words
francine
who
was
springing
from
the
carriage
felt
herself
grasped
by
a
strong
hand
the
sudden
weight
of
that
enormous
hand
made
her
shriek
violently
she
turned
and
was
instantly
silenced
on
recognizing
twice
i
owe
to
chance
said
the
marquis
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
revelation
of
the
sweetest
secrets
of
the
heart
thanks
to
francine
i
now
know
you
bear
the
gracious
name
of
marie
marie
the
name
i
have
invoked
in
my
distresses
marie
a
name
i
shall
henceforth
speak
in
joy
and
never
without
sacrifice
mingling
religion
and
love
there
can
be
no
wrong
where
prayer
and
love
go
they
clasped
hands
looked
silently
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
the
excess
of
their
emotion
took
away
from
them
the
power
to
express
it
there
s
no
danger
for
rest
of
was
saying
roughly
to
francine
giving
to
his
hoarse
and
guttural
voice
a
reproachful
tone
and
emphasizing
his
last
words
in
a
way
to
stupefy
the
innocent
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
saw
ferocity
in
that
face
the
moonlight
seemed
to
heighten
the
effect
of
it
the
savage
breton
holding
his
cap
in
one
hand
and
his
heavy
carbine
in
the
other
dumpy
and
thickset
as
a
gnome
and
bathed
in
that
white
light
the
shadows
of
which
give
such
fantastic
aspects
to
forms
seemed
to
belong
more
to
a
world
of
goblins
than
to
reality
this
apparition
and
its
tone
of
reproach
came
upon
francine
with
the
suddenness
of
a
phantom
he
turned
rapidly
to
madame
du
gua
with
whom
he
exchanged
a
few
eager
words
which
francine
who
had
somewhat
forgotten
the
dialect
of
lower
brittany
did
not
understand
the
lady
seemed
to
be
giving
him
a
series
of
orders
the
short
conference
ended
by
an
imperious
gesture
of
the
lady
s
hand
pointing
out
to
the
chouan
the
lovers
standing
a
little
distance
apart
before
obeying
glanced
at
francine
whom
he
seemed
to
pity
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
and
the
girl
was
aware
that
his
silence
was
compulsory
the
rough
and
sunburnt
skin
of
his
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
eyebrows
were
drawn
violently
together
did
he
think
of
disobeying
a
renewed
order
to
kill
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
contortion
of
his
face
made
him
all
the
more
hideous
to
madame
du
gua
but
to
francine
the
flash
of
his
eye
seemed
almost
gentle
for
it
taught
her
to
feel
intuitively
that
the
violence
of
his
savage
nature
would
yield
to
her
will
as
a
woman
and
that
she
reigned
next
to
god
in
that
rough
heart
the
lovers
were
interrupted
in
their
tender
interview
by
madame
du
gua
who
ran
up
to
marie
with
a
cry
and
pulled
her
away
as
though
some
danger
threatened
her
her
real
object
however
was
to
enable
a
member
of
the
royalist
committee
of
alencon
whom
she
saw
approaching
them
to
speak
privately
to
the
gars
beware
of
the
girl
you
met
at
the
hotel
in
alencon
she
will
betray
you
said
the
chevalier
de
valois
in
the
young
man
s
ear
and
immediately
he
and
his
little
breton
horse
disappeared
among
the
bushes
from
which
he
had
issued
the
firing
was
heavy
at
that
moment
but
the
combatants
did
not
come
to
close
quarters
adjutant
said
isn
t
it
a
sham
attack
to
capture
our
travellers
and
get
a
the
devil
is
in
it
but
i
believe
you
are
right
replied
gerard
darting
back
towards
the
highroad
just
then
the
chouan
fire
slackened
for
in
truth
the
whole
object
of
the
skirmish
was
to
give
the
chevalier
an
opportunity
to
utter
his
warning
to
the
gars
merle
who
saw
the
enemy
disappearing
across
the
hedges
thought
best
not
to
follow
them
nor
to
enter
upon
a
fight
that
was
uselessly
dangerous
gerard
ordered
the
escort
to
take
its
former
position
on
the
road
and
the
convoy
was
again
in
motion
without
the
loss
of
a
single
man
the
captain
offered
his
hand
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
replace
her
in
the
coach
for
the
young
nobleman
stood
motionless
as
if
thunderstruck
marie
amazed
at
his
attitude
got
into
the
carriage
alone
without
accepting
the
politeness
of
the
republican
she
turned
her
head
towards
her
lover
saw
him
still
motionless
and
was
stupefied
at
the
sudden
change
which
had
evidently
come
over
him
the
young
man
slowly
returned
his
whole
manner
betraying
deep
disgust
was
i
not
right
said
madame
du
gua
in
his
ear
as
she
led
him
to
the
coach
we
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
creature
who
is
trafficking
for
your
head
but
since
she
is
such
a
fool
as
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
behave
like
a
boy
pretend
to
love
her
at
least
till
we
reach
la
vivetiere
once
there
but
she
thought
to
herself
seeing
the
young
man
take
his
place
with
a
dazed
air
as
if
bewildered
can
it
be
that
he
already
loves
her
the
coach
rolled
on
over
the
sandy
road
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
eyes
all
seemed
changed
death
was
gliding
beside
her
love
perhaps
it
was
only
fancy
but
to
a
woman
who
loves
fancy
is
as
vivid
as
reality
francine
who
had
clearly
understood
from
s
glance
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
fate
over
which
she
had
commanded
him
to
watch
was
in
other
hands
than
his
looked
pale
and
haggard
and
could
scarcely
restrain
her
tears
when
her
mistress
spoke
to
her
to
her
eyes
madame
du
gua
s
female
malignancy
was
scarcely
concealed
by
her
treacherous
smiles
and
the
sudden
changes
which
her
obsequious
attentions
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
made
in
her
manners
voice
and
expression
was
of
a
nature
to
frighten
a
watchful
observer
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
herself
shuddered
instinctively
asking
herself
why
should
i
fear
she
is
his
then
she
trembled
in
every
limb
as
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
is
she
really
his
mother
an
abyss
suddenly
opened
before
her
and
she
cast
a
look
upon
the
mother
and
son
which
finally
enlightened
her
that
woman
loves
him
she
thought
but
why
has
she
begun
these
attentions
after
showing
me
such
coolness
am
i
lost
or
is
she
afraid
of
me
as
for
the
young
man
he
was
flushed
and
pale
by
turns
but
he
kept
a
quiet
attitude
and
lowered
his
eyes
to
conceal
the
emotions
which
agitated
him
the
graceful
curve
of
his
lips
was
lost
in
their
close
compression
and
his
skin
turned
yellow
under
the
struggle
of
his
stormy
thoughts
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
unable
to
decide
whether
any
love
for
her
remained
in
his
evident
anger
the
road
flanked
by
woods
at
this
particular
point
became
darker
and
more
gloomy
and
the
obscurity
prevented
the
eyes
of
the
silent
travellers
from
questioning
each
other
the
sighing
of
the
wind
the
rustling
of
the
trees
the
measured
step
of
the
escort
gave
that
almost
solemn
character
to
the
scene
which
quickens
the
pulses
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
could
not
long
try
in
vain
to
discover
the
reason
of
this
change
the
recollection
of
corentin
came
to
her
like
a
flash
and
reminded
her
suddenly
of
her
real
destiny
for
the
first
time
since
the
morning
she
reflected
seriously
on
her
position
until
then
she
had
yielded
herself
up
to
the
delight
of
loving
without
a
thought
of
the
past
or
of
the
future
unable
to
bear
the
agony
of
her
mind
she
sought
with
the
patience
of
love
to
obtain
a
look
from
the
young
man
s
eyes
and
when
she
did
so
her
paleness
and
the
quiver
in
her
face
had
so
penetrating
an
influence
over
him
that
he
wavered
but
the
softening
was
momentary
are
you
ill
mademoiselle
he
said
but
his
voice
had
no
gentleness
the
very
question
the
look
the
gesture
all
served
to
convince
her
that
the
events
of
this
day
belonged
to
a
mirage
of
the
soul
which
was
fast
disappearing
like
mists
before
the
wind
am
i
ill
she
replied
with
a
forced
laugh
i
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
i
supposed
you
understood
each
other
remarked
madame
du
gua
with
specious
kindliness
neither
the
young
man
nor
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
replied
the
girl
doubly
insulted
was
angered
at
feeling
her
powerful
beauty
powerless
she
knew
she
could
discover
the
cause
of
the
present
situation
the
moment
she
chose
to
do
so
but
for
the
first
time
perhaps
a
woman
recoiled
before
a
secret
human
life
is
sadly
fertile
in
situations
where
as
a
result
of
either
too
much
meditation
or
of
some
catastrophe
our
thoughts
seem
to
hold
to
nothing
they
have
no
substance
no
point
of
departure
and
the
present
has
no
hooks
by
which
to
hold
to
the
past
or
fasten
on
the
future
this
was
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
condition
at
the
present
moment
leaning
back
in
the
carriage
she
sat
there
like
an
uprooted
shrub
silent
and
suffering
she
looked
at
no
one
wrapped
herself
in
her
grief
and
buried
herself
so
completely
in
the
unseen
world
the
refuge
of
the
miserable
that
she
saw
nothing
around
her
crows
crossed
the
road
in
the
air
above
them
cawing
but
although
like
all
strong
hearts
hers
had
a
superstitious
corner
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
omen
the
party
travelled
on
in
silence
already
parted
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
saying
to
herself
yet
no
one
about
us
has
uttered
one
word
could
it
be
corentin
it
is
not
his
interest
to
speak
who
can
have
come
to
this
spot
and
accused
me
just
loved
and
already
abandoned
i
sow
attraction
and
i
reap
contempt
is
it
my
perpetual
fate
to
see
happiness
and
ever
lose
it
pangs
hitherto
unknown
to
her
wrung
her
heart
for
she
now
loved
truly
and
for
the
first
time
yet
she
had
not
so
wholly
delivered
herself
to
her
lover
that
she
could
not
take
refuge
from
her
pain
in
the
natural
pride
and
dignity
of
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
the
secret
of
her
love
a
secret
often
kept
by
women
under
torture
itself
had
not
escaped
her
lips
presently
she
rose
from
her
reclining
attitude
ashamed
that
she
had
shown
her
passion
by
her
silent
sufferings
she
shook
her
head
with
a
action
and
showed
a
face
or
rather
a
mask
that
was
gay
and
smiling
then
she
raised
her
voice
to
disguise
the
quiver
of
it
where
are
we
she
said
to
captain
merle
who
kept
himself
at
a
certain
distance
from
the
carriage
about
six
miles
from
fougeres
we
shall
soon
be
there
shall
we
not
she
went
on
to
encourage
a
conversation
in
which
she
might
show
some
preference
for
the
young
captain
a
breton
mile
said
merle
much
delighted
has
the
disadvantage
of
never
ending
when
you
are
at
the
top
of
one
hill
you
see
a
valley
and
another
hill
when
you
reach
the
summit
of
the
slope
we
are
now
ascending
you
will
see
the
plateau
of
mont
pelerine
in
the
distance
let
us
hope
the
chouans
won
t
take
their
revenge
there
now
in
going
up
hill
and
going
down
hill
one
doesn
t
make
much
headway
from
la
pelerine
you
will
still
see
the
young
made
a
movement
at
the
name
which
marie
alone
noticed
what
is
la
pelerine
she
asked
hastily
interrupting
the
captain
s
description
of
breton
topography
it
is
the
summit
of
a
mountain
said
merle
which
gives
its
name
to
the
maine
valley
through
which
we
shall
presently
pass
it
separates
this
valley
from
that
of
couesnon
at
the
end
of
which
is
the
town
of
fougeres
the
chief
town
in
brittany
we
had
a
fight
there
last
vendemiaire
with
the
gars
and
his
brigands
we
were
escorting
breton
conscripts
who
meant
to
kill
us
sooner
than
leave
their
own
land
but
hulot
is
a
rough
christian
and
he
gave
them
did
you
see
the
gars
she
asked
what
sort
of
man
is
he
her
keen
malicious
eyes
never
left
the
vicomte
s
face
well
mademoiselle
replied
merle
nettled
at
being
always
interrupted
he
is
so
like
citizen
du
gua
that
if
your
friend
did
not
wear
the
uniform
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
i
could
swear
it
was
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
looked
fixedly
at
the
cold
impassible
young
man
who
had
scorned
her
but
she
saw
nothing
in
him
that
betrayed
the
slightest
feeling
of
alarm
she
warned
him
by
a
bitter
smile
that
she
had
now
discovered
the
secret
so
treacherously
kept
then
in
a
jesting
voice
her
nostrils
dilating
with
pleasure
and
her
head
so
turned
that
she
could
watch
the
young
man
and
yet
see
merle
she
said
to
the
republican
that
new
leader
gives
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
to
the
first
consul
he
is
very
daring
they
say
but
he
has
the
weakness
of
rushing
headlong
into
adventures
especially
with
we
are
counting
on
that
to
get
even
with
him
said
the
captain
if
we
catch
him
for
only
an
hour
we
shall
put
a
bullet
in
his
head
he
ll
do
the
same
to
us
if
he
meets
us
so
oh
said
the
we
have
nothing
to
fear
your
soldiers
can
not
go
as
far
as
la
pelerine
they
are
tired
and
if
you
consent
we
can
all
rest
a
short
distance
from
here
my
mother
stops
at
la
vivetiere
the
road
to
which
turns
off
a
few
rods
farther
on
these
ladies
might
like
to
stop
there
too
they
must
be
tired
with
their
long
drive
from
alencon
without
resting
and
as
mademoiselle
he
added
with
forced
politeness
has
had
the
generosity
to
give
safety
as
well
as
pleasure
to
our
journey
perhaps
she
will
deign
to
accept
a
supper
from
my
mother
and
i
think
captain
he
added
addressing
merle
the
times
are
not
so
bad
but
what
we
can
find
a
barrel
of
cider
for
your
men
the
gars
can
t
have
taken
all
at
least
my
mother
thinks
not
your
mother
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
interrupting
him
in
a
tone
of
irony
and
making
no
reply
to
his
invitation
does
my
age
seem
more
improbable
to
you
this
evening
mademoiselle
said
madame
du
gua
unfortunately
i
was
married
very
young
and
my
son
was
born
when
i
was
are
you
not
mistaken
madame
when
you
were
thirty
madame
du
gua
turned
livid
as
she
swallowed
the
sarcasm
she
would
have
liked
to
revenge
herself
on
the
spot
but
was
forced
to
smile
for
she
was
determined
at
any
cost
even
that
of
insult
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
feelings
that
actuated
the
young
girl
she
therefore
pretended
not
to
have
understood
her
the
chouans
have
never
had
a
more
cruel
leader
than
the
gars
if
we
are
to
believe
the
stories
about
him
she
said
addressing
herself
vaguely
to
both
francine
and
her
mistress
oh
as
for
cruel
i
don
t
believe
that
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
he
knows
how
to
lie
but
he
seems
rather
credulous
himself
the
leader
of
a
party
ought
not
to
be
the
plaything
of
do
you
know
him
asked
the
quietly
no
she
replied
with
a
disdainful
glance
but
i
thought
i
oh
mademoiselle
he
s
a
yes
a
said
captain
merle
shaking
his
head
and
giving
with
an
expressive
gesture
the
peculiar
meaning
to
the
word
which
it
had
in
those
days
but
has
since
lost
those
old
families
do
sometimes
send
out
vigorous
shoots
he
has
just
returned
from
a
country
where
they
say
the
didn
t
find
life
too
easy
and
men
ripen
like
medlars
in
the
straw
if
that
fellow
is
really
clever
he
can
lead
us
a
pretty
dance
he
has
already
formed
companies
of
light
infantry
who
oppose
our
troops
and
neutralize
the
efforts
of
the
government
if
we
burn
a
royalist
village
he
burns
two
of
ours
he
can
hold
an
immense
tract
of
country
and
force
us
to
spread
out
our
men
at
the
very
moment
when
we
want
them
on
one
spot
oh
he
knows
what
he
is
he
is
cutting
his
country
s
throat
said
gerard
in
a
loud
voice
interrupting
the
captain
then
said
the
if
his
death
would
deliver
the
nation
why
don
t
you
catch
him
and
shoot
him
as
he
spoke
he
tried
to
look
into
the
depths
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
soul
and
one
of
those
voiceless
scenes
the
dramatic
vividness
and
fleeting
sagacity
of
which
can
not
be
reproduced
in
language
passed
between
them
in
a
flash
danger
is
always
interesting
the
worst
criminal
threatened
with
death
excites
pity
though
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
now
certain
that
the
lover
who
had
cast
her
off
was
this
very
leader
of
the
chouans
she
was
not
ready
to
verify
her
suspicions
by
giving
him
up
she
had
quite
another
curiosity
to
satisfy
she
preferred
to
doubt
or
to
believe
as
her
passion
led
her
and
she
now
began
deliberately
to
play
with
peril
her
eyes
full
of
scornful
meaning
bade
the
young
chief
notice
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
by
thus
presenting
to
his
mind
triumphantly
an
image
of
his
danger
she
made
him
feel
that
his
life
depended
on
a
word
from
her
and
her
lips
seemed
to
quiver
on
the
verge
of
pronouncing
it
like
an
american
indian
she
watched
every
muscle
of
the
face
of
her
enemy
tied
as
it
were
to
the
stake
while
she
brandished
her
tomahawk
gracefully
enjoying
a
revenge
that
was
still
innocent
and
torturing
like
a
mistress
who
still
loves
if
i
had
a
son
like
yours
madame
she
said
to
madame
du
gua
who
was
visibly
frightened
i
should
wear
mourning
from
the
day
when
i
had
yielded
him
to
danger
i
should
know
no
peace
of
no
answer
was
made
to
this
speech
she
turned
her
head
repeatedly
to
the
escort
and
then
suddenly
to
madame
du
gua
without
detecting
the
slightest
secret
signal
between
the
lady
and
the
gars
which
might
have
confirmed
her
suspicions
on
the
nature
of
their
intimacy
which
she
longed
to
doubt
the
young
chief
calmly
smiled
and
bore
without
flinching
the
scrutiny
she
forced
him
to
undergo
his
attitude
and
the
expression
of
his
face
were
those
of
a
man
indifferent
to
danger
he
even
seemed
to
say
at
times
this
is
your
chance
to
avenge
your
wounded
vanity
take
it
i
have
no
desire
to
lessen
my
contempt
for
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
began
to
study
the
young
man
from
the
of
her
position
with
coolness
and
dignity
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
admired
his
courage
and
tranquillity
happy
in
discovering
that
the
man
she
loved
bore
an
ancient
title
the
distinctions
of
which
please
every
woman
she
also
found
pleasure
in
meeting
him
in
their
present
situation
where
as
champion
of
a
cause
ennobled
by
misfortune
he
was
fighting
with
all
the
faculties
of
a
strong
soul
against
a
republic
that
was
constantly
victorious
she
rejoiced
to
see
him
brought
face
to
face
with
danger
and
still
displaying
the
courage
and
bravery
so
powerful
on
a
woman
s
heart
again
and
again
she
put
him
to
the
test
obeying
perhaps
the
instinct
which
induces
a
woman
to
play
with
her
victim
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
by
virtue
of
what
law
do
you
put
the
chouans
to
death
she
said
to
merle
that
of
the
of
last
fructidor
which
outlaws
the
insurgent
departments
and
proclaims
martial
law
replied
the
republican
may
i
ask
why
i
have
the
honor
to
attract
your
eyes
she
said
presently
to
the
young
chief
who
was
attentively
watching
her
because
of
a
feeling
which
a
man
of
honor
can
not
express
to
any
woman
no
matter
who
she
is
replied
the
marquis
de
montauran
in
a
low
voice
bending
down
to
her
we
live
in
times
he
said
aloud
when
women
do
the
work
of
the
executioner
and
wield
the
axe
with
even
better
she
looked
at
de
montauran
fixedly
then
delighted
to
be
attacked
by
the
man
whose
life
she
held
in
her
hands
she
said
in
a
low
voice
smiling
softly
your
head
is
a
very
poor
one
the
executioner
does
not
want
it
i
shall
keep
it
the
marquis
looked
at
the
inexplicable
girl
whose
love
had
overcome
all
even
insult
and
who
now
avenged
herself
by
forgiving
that
which
women
are
said
never
to
forgive
his
eyes
grew
less
stern
less
cold
a
look
of
sadness
came
upon
his
face
his
love
was
stronger
than
he
suspected
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
satisfied
with
these
faint
signs
of
a
desired
reconciliation
glanced
at
him
tenderly
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
kiss
then
she
leaned
back
once
more
in
the
carriage
determined
not
to
risk
the
future
of
this
happy
drama
believing
she
had
assured
it
with
her
smile
she
was
so
beautiful
she
knew
so
well
how
to
conquer
all
obstacles
to
love
she
was
so
accustomed
to
take
all
risks
and
push
on
at
all
hazards
she
loved
the
unexpected
and
the
tumults
of
life
why
should
she
fear
before
long
the
carriage
under
the
young
chief
s
directions
left
the
highway
and
took
a
road
cut
between
banks
planted
with
more
like
a
ditch
than
a
roadway
which
led
to
la
vivetiere
the
carriage
now
advanced
rapidly
leaving
the
escort
to
follow
slowly
towards
the
the
gray
roofs
of
which
appeared
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
some
of
the
men
lingered
on
the
way
to
knock
the
stiff
clay
of
the
from
their
shoes
this
is
devilishly
like
the
road
to
paradise
remarked
thanks
to
the
impatience
of
the
postilion
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
soon
saw
the
chateau
of
la
vivetiere
this
house
standing
at
the
end
of
a
sort
of
promontory
was
protected
and
surrounded
by
two
deep
lakelets
and
could
be
reached
only
by
a
narrow
causeway
that
part
of
the
little
peninsula
on
which
the
house
and
gardens
were
placed
was
still
further
protected
by
a
moat
filled
with
water
from
the
two
lakes
which
it
connected
the
house
really
stood
on
an
island
that
was
impregnable
an
invaluable
retreat
for
a
chieftain
who
could
be
surprised
there
only
by
treachery
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
put
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
as
she
heard
the
rusty
hinges
of
the
great
gates
open
to
give
entrance
to
an
arched
portal
which
had
been
much
injured
during
the
late
war
the
gloomy
colors
of
the
scene
which
met
her
eyes
almost
extinguished
the
thoughts
of
love
and
coquetry
in
which
she
had
been
indulging
the
carriage
entered
a
large
courtyard
that
was
nearly
square
bordered
on
each
side
by
the
steep
banks
of
the
lakelets
those
sterile
shores
washed
by
water
which
was
covered
with
large
green
patches
had
no
other
ornament
than
aquatic
trees
devoid
of
foliage
the
twisted
trunks
and
hoary
heads
of
which
rising
from
the
reeds
and
rushes
gave
them
a
certain
grotesque
likeness
to
gigantic
marmosets
these
ugly
growths
seemed
to
waken
and
talk
to
each
other
when
the
frogs
deserted
them
with
much
croaking
and
the
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
wheels
flew
low
upon
the
surface
of
the
pools
the
courtyard
full
of
rank
and
seeded
grasses
reeds
and
shrubs
either
dwarf
or
parasite
excluded
all
impression
of
order
or
of
splendor
the
house
appeared
to
have
been
long
abandoned
the
roof
seemed
to
bend
beneath
the
weight
of
the
various
vegetations
which
grew
upon
it
the
walls
though
built
of
the
smooth
slaty
stone
which
abounds
in
that
region
showed
many
rifts
and
chinks
where
ivy
had
fastened
its
rootlets
two
main
buildings
joined
at
the
angle
by
a
tall
tower
which
faced
the
lake
formed
the
whole
of
the
chateau
the
doors
and
swinging
rotten
shutters
rusty
balustrades
and
broken
windows
of
which
seemed
ready
to
fall
at
the
first
tempest
the
north
wind
whistled
through
these
ruins
to
which
the
moon
with
her
indefinite
light
gave
the
character
and
outline
of
a
great
spectre
but
the
colors
of
those
granites
mingling
with
the
black
and
tawny
schists
must
have
been
seen
in
order
to
understand
how
vividly
a
spectral
image
was
suggested
by
the
empty
and
gloomy
carcass
of
the
building
its
disjointed
stones
and
paneless
windows
the
battered
tower
and
broken
roofs
gave
it
the
aspect
of
a
skeleton
the
birds
of
prey
which
flew
from
it
shrieking
added
another
feature
to
this
vague
resemblance
a
few
tall
standing
behind
the
house
waved
their
dark
foliage
above
the
roof
and
several
yews
cut
into
formal
shapes
at
the
angles
of
the
building
festooned
it
gloomily
like
the
ornaments
on
a
hearse
the
style
of
the
doors
the
coarseness
of
the
decorations
the
want
of
harmony
in
the
architecture
were
all
characteristic
of
the
feudal
manors
of
which
brittany
was
proud
perhaps
justly
proud
for
they
maintained
upon
that
gaelic
ground
a
species
of
monumental
history
of
the
nebulous
period
which
preceded
the
establishment
of
the
french
monarchy
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
whose
imagination
the
word
chateau
brought
none
but
its
conventional
ideas
was
affected
by
the
funereal
aspect
of
the
scene
she
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
stood
apart
gazing
at
in
terror
and
debating
within
herself
what
action
she
ought
to
take
francine
heard
madame
du
gua
give
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
felt
herself
in
safety
beyond
reach
of
the
blues
an
exclamation
escaped
her
when
the
gates
were
closed
and
she
saw
the
carriage
and
its
occupants
within
the
walls
of
this
natural
fortress
the
marquis
de
montauran
turned
hastily
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
divining
the
thoughts
that
crowded
in
her
mind
this
chateau
he
said
rather
sadly
was
ruined
by
the
war
just
as
my
plans
for
our
happiness
have
been
ruined
by
how
ruined
she
asked
in
surprise
are
you
indeed
beautiful
brilliant
and
of
noble
birth
he
asked
ironically
repeating
the
words
she
had
herself
used
in
their
former
conversation
who
has
told
you
to
the
contrary
friends
in
whom
i
put
faith
who
care
for
my
safety
and
are
on
the
watch
against
treachery
she
exclaimed
in
a
sarcastic
tone
have
you
forgotten
hulot
and
alencon
already
you
have
no
memory
a
dangerous
defect
in
the
leader
of
a
party
but
if
friends
she
added
with
increased
sarcasm
are
so
in
your
heart
keep
your
friends
nothing
is
comparable
to
the
joys
of
friendship
adieu
neither
i
nor
the
soldiers
of
the
republic
will
stop
she
turned
towards
the
gateway
with
a
look
of
wounded
pride
and
scorn
and
her
motions
as
she
did
so
displayed
a
dignity
and
also
a
despair
which
changed
in
an
instant
the
thoughts
of
the
young
man
he
felt
that
the
cost
of
relinquishing
his
desires
was
too
great
and
he
gave
himself
up
deliberately
to
imprudence
and
credulity
he
loved
and
the
lovers
had
no
desire
now
to
quarrel
with
each
other
say
but
one
word
and
i
will
believe
you
he
said
in
a
supplicating
voice
one
word
she
answered
closing
her
lips
tightly
not
a
single
word
not
even
a
at
least
be
angry
with
me
he
entreated
trying
to
take
the
hand
she
withheld
from
him
that
is
if
you
dare
to
be
angry
with
the
leader
of
the
rebels
who
is
now
as
sad
and
distrustful
as
he
was
lately
happy
and
marie
gave
him
a
look
that
was
far
from
angry
and
he
added
you
have
my
secret
but
i
have
not
the
alabaster
brow
appeared
to
darken
at
these
words
she
cast
a
look
of
annoyance
on
the
young
chieftain
and
answered
hastily
tell
you
my
secret
never
in
love
every
word
every
glance
has
the
eloquence
of
the
moment
but
on
this
occasion
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
exclamation
revealed
nothing
and
clever
as
montauran
might
be
its
secret
was
impenetrable
to
him
though
the
tones
of
her
voice
betrayed
some
extraordinary
and
unusual
emotion
which
piqued
his
curiosity
you
have
a
singular
way
of
dispelling
suspicion
he
said
do
you
still
suspect
me
she
replied
looking
him
in
the
eye
as
if
to
say
what
rights
have
you
over
me
mademoiselle
said
the
young
man
in
a
voice
that
was
submissive
and
yet
firm
the
authority
you
exercise
over
republican
troops
this
escort
ah
that
reminds
me
my
escort
and
i
she
asked
in
a
slightly
satirical
tone
your
protectors
in
short
will
they
be
safe
here
yes
on
the
word
of
a
gentleman
whoever
you
be
you
and
your
party
have
nothing
to
fear
in
my
the
promise
was
made
with
so
loyal
and
generous
an
air
and
manner
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
felt
absolutely
secure
as
to
the
safety
of
the
republican
soldiers
she
was
about
to
speak
when
madame
du
gua
s
approach
silenced
her
that
lady
had
either
overheard
or
guessed
part
of
their
conversation
and
was
filled
with
anxiety
at
no
longer
perceiving
any
signs
of
animosity
between
them
as
soon
as
the
marquis
caught
sight
of
her
he
offered
his
hand
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
led
her
hastily
towards
the
house
as
if
to
escape
an
undesired
companion
i
am
in
their
way
thought
madame
du
gua
remaining
where
she
was
she
watched
the
lovers
walking
slowly
towards
the
portico
where
they
stopped
as
if
satisfied
to
have
placed
some
distance
between
themselves
and
her
yes
yes
i
am
in
their
way
she
repeated
speaking
to
herself
but
before
long
that
creature
will
not
be
in
mine
the
lake
god
willing
shall
have
her
i
ll
help
him
keep
his
word
as
a
gentleman
once
under
the
water
she
has
nothing
to
fear
what
can
be
safer
than
that
she
was
looking
fixedly
at
the
still
mirror
of
the
little
lake
to
the
right
when
suddenly
she
heard
a
rustling
among
the
rushes
and
saw
in
the
moonlight
the
face
of
rising
behind
the
gnarled
trunk
of
an
old
willow
none
but
those
who
knew
the
chouan
well
could
have
distinguished
him
from
the
tangle
of
branches
of
which
he
seemed
a
part
madame
du
gua
looked
about
her
with
some
distrust
she
saw
the
postilion
leading
his
horses
to
a
stable
in
the
wing
of
the
chateau
which
was
opposite
to
the
bank
where
was
hiding
francine
with
her
back
to
her
was
going
towards
the
two
lovers
who
at
that
moment
had
forgotten
the
whole
earth
madame
du
gua
with
a
finger
on
her
lip
to
demand
silence
walked
towards
the
chouan
who
guessed
rather
than
heard
her
question
how
many
of
you
are
here
they
are
i
counted
good
said
the
savage
with
sullen
satisfaction
attentive
to
all
francine
s
movements
the
chouan
disappeared
behind
the
willow
as
he
saw
her
turn
to
look
for
the
enemy
over
whom
she
was
keeping
an
instinctive
watch
six
or
eight
persons
attracted
by
the
noise
of
the
came
out
on
the
portico
shouting
it
is
the
gars
it
is
he
here
he
is
on
this
several
other
men
ran
out
and
their
coming
interrupted
the
lovers
the
marquis
de
montauran
went
hastily
up
to
them
making
an
imperative
gesture
for
silence
and
pointing
to
the
farther
end
of
the
causeway
where
the
republican
escort
was
just
appearing
at
the
sight
of
the
blue
uniforms
with
red
facings
and
the
glittering
bayonets
the
amazed
conspirators
called
out
hastily
you
have
surely
not
betrayed
us
if
i
had
i
should
not
warn
you
said
the
marquis
smiling
bitterly
those
blues
he
added
after
a
pause
are
the
escort
of
this
young
lady
whose
generosity
has
delivered
us
almost
miraculously
from
a
danger
we
were
in
at
alencon
i
will
tell
you
about
it
later
mademoiselle
and
her
escort
are
here
in
safety
on
my
word
as
a
gentleman
and
we
must
all
receive
them
as
madame
du
gua
and
francine
were
now
on
the
portico
the
marquis
offered
his
hand
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
group
of
gentlemen
parted
in
two
lines
to
allow
them
to
pass
endeavoring
as
they
did
so
to
catch
sight
of
the
young
lady
s
features
for
madame
du
gua
who
was
following
behind
excited
their
curiosity
by
secret
signs
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
saw
with
surprise
that
a
large
table
was
set
in
the
first
hall
for
about
twenty
guests
the
opened
into
a
vast
salon
where
the
whole
party
were
presently
assembled
these
rooms
were
in
keeping
with
the
dilapidated
appearance
of
the
outside
of
the
house
the
walnut
panels
polished
by
age
but
rough
and
coarse
in
design
and
badly
executed
were
loose
in
their
places
and
ready
to
fall
their
dingy
color
added
to
the
gloom
of
these
apartments
which
were
barren
of
curtains
and
mirrors
a
few
venerable
bits
of
furniture
in
the
last
stages
of
decay
alone
remained
and
harmonized
with
the
general
destruction
marie
noticed
maps
and
plans
stretched
out
upon
long
tables
and
in
the
corners
of
the
room
a
quantity
of
weapons
and
stacked
carbines
these
things
bore
witness
though
she
did
not
know
it
to
an
important
conference
between
the
leaders
of
the
vendeans
and
those
of
the
chouans
the
marquis
led
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
a
large
and
armchair
placed
beside
the
fireplace
francine
followed
and
stood
behind
her
mistress
leaning
on
the
back
of
that
ancient
bit
of
furniture
you
will
allow
me
for
a
moment
to
play
the
part
of
master
of
the
house
he
said
leaving
the
two
women
and
mingling
with
the
groups
of
his
other
guests
francine
saw
the
gentlemen
hasten
after
a
few
words
from
montauran
to
hide
their
weapons
maps
and
whatever
else
might
arouse
the
suspicions
of
the
republican
officers
some
took
off
their
broad
leather
belts
containing
pistols
and
the
marquis
requested
them
to
show
the
utmost
prudence
and
went
himself
to
see
to
the
reception
of
the
troublesome
guests
whom
fate
had
bestowed
upon
him
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
had
raised
her
feet
to
the
fire
and
was
now
warming
them
did
not
turn
her
head
as
montauran
left
the
room
thus
disappointing
those
present
who
were
anxious
to
see
her
francine
alone
saw
the
change
produced
upon
the
company
by
the
departure
of
the
young
chief
the
gentlemen
gathered
hastily
round
madame
du
gua
and
during
a
conversation
carried
on
in
an
undertone
between
them
they
all
turned
several
times
to
look
curiously
at
the
stranger
you
know
montauran
madame
du
gua
said
to
them
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
that
worthless
girl
and
as
you
can
easily
understand
he
thinks
all
my
warnings
selfish
our
friends
in
paris
messieurs
de
valois
and
d
esgrignon
have
warned
him
of
a
trap
set
for
him
by
throwing
some
such
creature
at
his
head
but
in
spite
of
this
he
allows
himself
to
be
fooled
by
the
first
woman
he
meets
a
girl
who
if
my
information
is
correct
has
stolen
a
great
name
only
to
disgrace
the
speaker
in
whom
our
readers
have
already
recognized
the
lady
who
instigated
the
attack
on
the
turgotine
may
be
allowed
to
keep
the
name
which
she
used
to
escape
the
dangers
that
threatened
her
in
alencon
the
publication
of
her
real
name
would
only
mortify
a
noble
family
already
deeply
afflicted
at
the
misconduct
of
this
woman
whose
history
by
the
bye
has
already
been
given
on
another
scene
the
curiosity
manifested
by
the
company
of
men
soon
became
impertinent
and
almost
hostile
a
few
harsh
words
reached
francine
s
ear
and
after
a
word
said
to
her
mistress
the
girl
retreated
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
marie
rose
turned
towards
the
insolent
group
and
gave
them
a
look
full
of
dignity
and
even
disdain
her
beauty
the
elegance
of
her
manners
and
her
pride
changed
the
behavior
of
her
enemies
and
won
her
the
flattering
murmur
which
escaped
their
lips
two
or
three
men
whose
outward
appearance
seemed
to
denote
the
habits
of
polite
society
and
the
gallantry
acquired
in
courts
came
towards
her
but
her
propriety
of
demeanor
forced
them
to
respect
her
and
none
dared
speak
to
her
so
that
instead
of
being
herself
arraigned
by
the
company
it
was
she
who
appeared
to
judge
of
them
these
chiefs
of
a
war
undertaken
for
god
and
the
king
bore
very
little
resemblance
to
the
portraits
her
fancy
had
drawn
of
them
the
struggle
really
great
in
itself
shrank
to
mean
proportions
as
she
observed
these
provincial
noblemen
all
with
one
or
two
vigorous
exceptions
devoid
of
significance
and
virility
having
made
to
herself
a
poem
of
such
heroes
marie
suddenly
awakened
to
the
truth
their
faces
expressed
to
her
eyes
more
a
love
of
scheming
than
a
love
of
glory
had
evidently
put
arms
into
their
hands
still
it
must
be
said
that
these
men
did
become
heroic
when
brought
into
action
the
loss
of
her
illusions
made
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
unjust
and
prevented
her
from
recognizing
the
real
devotion
which
rendered
several
of
these
men
remarkable
it
is
true
that
most
of
those
now
present
were
commonplace
a
few
original
and
marked
faces
appeared
among
them
but
even
these
were
belittled
by
the
artificiality
and
the
etiquette
of
aristocracy
if
marie
generously
granted
intellect
and
perception
to
the
latter
she
also
discerned
in
them
a
total
absence
of
the
simplicity
the
grandeur
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
among
the
triumphant
men
of
the
republic
this
nocturnal
assemblage
in
the
old
ruined
castle
made
her
smile
the
scene
seemed
symbolic
of
the
monarchy
but
the
thought
came
to
her
with
delight
that
the
marquis
at
least
played
a
noble
part
among
these
men
whose
only
remaining
merit
in
her
eyes
was
devotion
to
a
lost
cause
she
pictured
her
lover
s
face
upon
the
background
of
this
company
rejoicing
to
see
it
stand
forth
among
those
paltry
and
puny
figures
who
were
but
the
instruments
of
his
great
designs
the
footsteps
of
the
marquis
were
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
instantly
the
company
separated
into
little
groups
and
the
whisperings
ceased
like
schoolboys
who
have
plotted
mischief
in
the
master
s
absence
they
hurriedly
became
silent
and
orderly
montauran
entered
marie
had
the
happiness
of
admiring
him
among
his
fellows
of
whom
he
was
the
youngest
the
handsomest
and
the
chief
like
a
king
in
his
court
he
went
from
group
to
group
distributing
looks
and
nods
and
words
of
encouragement
or
warning
with
pressure
of
the
hands
and
smiles
doing
his
duty
as
leader
of
a
party
with
a
grace
and
hardly
to
be
expected
in
the
young
man
whom
marie
had
so
lately
accused
of
heedlessness
the
presence
of
the
marquis
put
an
end
to
the
open
curiosity
bestowed
on
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
but
madame
du
gua
s
scandalous
suggestions
bore
fruit
the
baron
du
guenic
familiarly
called
l
intime
who
by
rank
and
name
had
the
best
right
among
those
present
to
treat
montauran
familiarly
took
the
young
leader
by
the
arm
and
led
him
apart
my
dear
marquis
he
said
we
are
much
disturbed
at
seeing
you
on
the
point
of
committing
an
amazing
what
do
you
mean
by
that
do
you
know
where
that
girl
comes
from
who
she
is
and
what
her
schemes
about
you
are
don
t
trouble
yourself
my
dear
intime
between
you
and
me
my
fancy
for
her
will
be
over
yes
but
suppose
that
creature
betrays
you
i
ll
answer
that
when
you
tell
me
why
she
has
not
done
it
already
said
montauran
assuming
with
a
laugh
an
air
of
conceit
my
dear
fellow
look
at
that
charming
girl
watch
her
manners
and
dare
to
tell
me
she
is
not
a
woman
of
distinction
if
she
gave
you
a
few
favorable
looks
wouldn
t
you
feel
at
the
bottom
of
your
soul
a
respect
for
her
a
certain
lady
has
prejudiced
you
i
will
tell
you
this
if
she
were
the
lost
creature
our
friends
are
trying
to
make
her
out
i
would
after
what
she
and
i
have
said
to
each
other
kill
her
do
you
suppose
said
madame
du
gua
joining
them
that
fouche
is
fool
enough
to
send
you
a
common
prostitute
out
of
the
streets
he
has
provided
seductions
according
to
your
deserts
you
may
choose
to
be
blind
but
your
friends
are
keeping
their
eyes
open
to
protect
madame
replied
the
gars
his
eyes
flashing
with
anger
be
warned
take
no
steps
against
that
lady
nor
against
her
escort
if
you
do
nothing
shall
save
you
from
my
vengeance
i
choose
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
is
to
be
treated
with
the
utmost
respect
and
as
a
lady
belonging
to
my
family
we
are
i
believe
related
to
the
de
the
opposition
the
marquis
was
made
to
feel
produced
the
usual
effect
of
such
obstacles
on
all
young
men
though
he
had
apparently
treated
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
rather
lightly
and
left
it
to
be
supposed
that
his
passion
for
her
was
a
mere
caprice
he
now
from
a
feeling
of
pride
made
immense
strides
in
his
relation
to
her
by
openly
protecting
her
his
honor
became
concerned
in
compelling
respect
to
her
person
and
he
went
from
group
to
group
assuring
his
friends
in
the
tone
of
a
man
whom
it
was
dangerous
to
contradict
that
the
lady
was
really
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
doubts
and
gossip
ceased
at
once
as
soon
as
montauran
felt
that
harmony
was
restored
and
anxiety
allayed
he
returned
to
his
mistress
eagerly
saying
in
a
low
voice
those
mischievous
people
have
robbed
me
of
an
hour
s
i
am
glad
you
have
come
back
to
me
she
said
smiling
i
warn
you
that
i
am
inquisitive
therefore
you
must
not
get
tired
of
my
questions
tell
me
in
the
first
place
who
is
that
worthy
in
a
green
cloth
jacket
that
is
the
famous
major
brigaut
a
man
from
the
marais
a
comrade
of
the
late
mercier
called
la
and
that
fat
priest
with
the
red
face
to
whom
he
is
talking
at
this
moment
about
me
she
went
on
do
you
want
to
know
what
they
are
saying
do
i
want
to
know
it
what
a
useless
question
but
i
could
not
tell
it
without
offending
if
you
allow
me
to
be
insulted
in
your
house
without
avenging
me
marquis
adieu
she
said
i
will
not
stay
another
moment
i
have
some
qualms
already
about
deceiving
these
poor
republicans
loyal
and
confiding
as
they
are
she
made
a
few
hasty
steps
the
marquis
followed
her
dear
marie
listen
to
me
on
my
honor
i
have
silenced
their
evil
speaking
without
knowing
whether
it
was
false
or
true
but
placed
as
i
am
if
friends
whom
we
have
in
all
the
ministries
in
paris
warn
me
to
beware
of
every
woman
i
meet
and
assure
me
that
fouche
has
employed
against
me
a
judith
of
the
streets
it
is
not
unnatural
that
my
best
friends
here
should
think
you
too
beautiful
to
be
an
honest
as
he
spoke
the
marquis
plunged
a
glance
into
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
eyes
she
colored
and
was
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
i
deserve
these
insults
she
said
i
wish
you
really
thought
me
that
despicable
creature
and
still
loved
me
then
indeed
i
could
no
longer
doubt
you
i
believed
in
you
when
you
were
deceiving
me
and
you
will
not
believe
me
now
when
i
am
true
let
us
make
an
end
of
this
monsieur
she
said
frowning
but
turning
pale
as
death
adieu
she
rushed
towards
the
with
a
movement
of
despair
marie
my
life
is
yours
said
the
young
marquis
in
her
ear
she
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
no
no
she
said
i
will
be
generous
farewell
in
coming
with
you
here
i
did
not
think
of
my
past
nor
of
your
future
i
was
beside
you
can
not
mean
that
you
will
leave
me
now
when
i
offer
you
my
life
you
offer
it
in
a
moment
of
passion
of
i
offer
it
without
regret
and
forever
he
replied
she
returned
to
the
room
they
had
left
hiding
his
emotions
the
marquis
continued
the
conversation
that
fat
priest
whose
name
you
asked
is
the
abbe
gudin
a
jesuit
obstinate
enough
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
devoted
enough
to
remain
in
france
in
spite
of
the
decree
of
which
banished
his
order
he
is
the
firebrand
of
the
war
in
these
regions
and
a
propagandist
of
the
religious
association
called
the
trained
to
use
religion
as
an
instrument
he
persuades
his
followers
that
if
they
are
killed
they
will
be
brought
to
life
again
and
he
knows
how
to
rouse
their
fanaticism
by
shrewd
sermons
you
see
it
is
necessary
to
work
upon
every
man
s
selfish
interests
to
attain
a
great
end
that
is
the
secret
of
all
political
and
that
vigorous
muscular
old
man
with
the
repulsive
face
who
is
he
i
mean
the
one
in
the
ragged
gown
of
a
barrister
he
aspires
to
be
considered
a
did
you
never
hear
of
de
longuy
is
that
he
exclaimed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
horrified
you
employ
such
men
as
that
hush
he
ll
hear
you
do
you
see
that
other
man
in
malignant
conversation
with
madame
du
gua
the
one
in
black
who
looks
like
a
judge
that
is
one
of
our
la
billardiere
son
of
a
councillor
to
the
breton
parliament
whose
real
name
is
something
like
flamet
he
is
in
close
correspondence
with
the
and
his
neighbor
the
one
who
is
just
putting
up
his
white
clay
pipe
and
uses
all
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
to
snap
the
box
like
a
by
jove
you
are
right
he
was
to
the
deceased
husband
of
that
lady
and
now
commands
one
of
the
companies
i
send
against
the
republican
militia
he
and
are
the
two
most
conscientious
vassals
the
king
has
but
she
who
is
she
charette
s
last
mistress
replied
the
marquis
she
wields
great
influence
over
all
these
is
she
faithful
to
his
memory
for
all
answer
the
marquis
gave
a
dubious
smile
do
you
think
well
of
her
you
are
very
she
is
my
enemy
because
she
can
no
longer
be
my
rival
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
laughing
i
forgive
her
her
past
errors
if
she
forgives
mine
who
is
that
officer
with
the
long
moustache
permit
me
not
to
name
him
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
first
consul
by
assassination
whether
he
succeeds
or
not
you
will
hear
of
him
he
is
certain
to
become
and
you
have
come
here
to
command
such
men
as
these
she
exclaimed
in
horror
are
they
king
s
defenders
where
are
the
gentlemen
and
the
great
lords
where
said
the
marquis
coolly
they
are
in
all
the
courts
of
europe
who
else
should
win
over
kings
and
cabinets
and
armies
to
serve
the
bourbon
cause
and
hurl
them
at
that
republic
which
threatens
monarchies
and
social
order
with
death
and
destruction
ah
she
said
with
generous
emotion
be
to
me
henceforth
the
source
from
which
i
draw
the
ideas
i
must
still
acquire
about
your
cause
i
consent
but
let
me
still
remember
that
you
are
the
only
noble
who
does
his
duty
in
fighting
france
with
frenchmen
without
the
help
of
foreigners
i
am
a
woman
i
feel
that
if
my
child
struck
me
in
anger
i
could
forgive
him
but
if
he
saw
me
beaten
by
a
stranger
and
consented
to
it
i
should
regard
him
as
a
you
shall
remain
a
republican
said
the
marquis
in
the
ardor
produced
by
the
generous
words
which
confirmed
his
hopes
republican
no
i
am
that
no
longer
i
could
not
now
respect
you
if
you
submitted
to
the
first
consul
she
replied
but
neither
do
i
like
to
see
you
at
the
head
of
men
who
are
pillaging
a
corner
of
france
instead
of
making
war
against
the
whole
republic
for
whom
are
you
fighting
what
do
you
expect
of
a
king
restored
to
his
throne
by
your
efforts
a
woman
did
that
great
thing
once
and
the
liberated
king
allowed
her
to
be
burned
such
men
are
the
anointed
of
the
lord
and
there
is
danger
in
meddling
with
sacred
things
let
god
take
care
of
his
own
and
place
displace
and
replace
them
on
their
purple
seats
but
if
you
have
counted
the
cost
and
seen
the
poor
return
that
will
come
to
you
you
are
tenfold
greater
in
my
eyes
than
i
thought
you
ah
you
are
bewitching
don
t
attempt
to
indoctrinate
my
followers
or
i
shall
be
left
without
a
if
you
would
let
me
convert
you
only
you
she
said
we
might
live
happily
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
all
these
men
whom
you
seem
to
despise
said
the
marquis
in
a
graver
tone
will
know
how
to
die
when
the
struggle
comes
and
all
their
misdeeds
will
be
forgotten
besides
if
my
efforts
are
crowned
with
some
success
the
laurel
leaves
of
victory
will
hide
i
see
no
one
but
you
who
is
risking
you
are
mistaken
i
am
not
the
only
one
he
replied
with
true
modesty
see
over
there
the
new
leaders
from
la
vendee
the
first
whom
you
must
have
heard
of
as
le
grand
jacques
is
the
comte
de
fontain
the
other
is
la
billardiere
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
just
have
you
forgotten
quiberon
where
la
billardiere
played
so
equivocal
a
part
she
said
struck
by
a
sudden
recollection
la
billardiere
took
a
great
deal
upon
himself
serving
princes
is
far
from
lying
on
a
bed
of
ah
you
make
me
shudder
cried
marie
marquis
she
continued
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
indicate
some
mysterious
personal
reticence
a
single
instant
suffices
to
destroy
illusions
and
to
betray
secrets
on
which
the
life
and
happiness
of
many
may
depend
she
stopped
as
though
she
feared
she
had
said
too
much
then
she
added
in
another
tone
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
that
those
republican
soldiers
were
in
i
will
be
prudent
he
said
smiling
to
disguise
his
emotion
but
say
no
more
about
your
soldiers
have
i
not
answered
for
their
safety
on
my
word
as
a
gentleman
and
after
all
she
said
what
right
have
i
to
dictate
to
you
be
my
master
henceforth
did
i
not
tell
you
it
would
drive
me
to
despair
to
rule
a
slave
monsieur
le
marquis
said
major
brigaut
respectfully
interrupting
the
conversation
how
long
are
the
blues
to
remain
here
they
will
leave
as
soon
as
they
are
rested
said
marie
the
marquis
looked
about
the
room
and
noticed
the
agitation
of
those
present
he
left
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
his
place
beside
her
was
taken
at
once
by
madame
du
gua
whose
smiling
and
treacherous
face
was
in
no
way
disconcerted
by
the
young
chief
s
bitter
smile
just
then
francine
standing
by
the
window
gave
a
stifled
cry
marie
noticing
with
amazement
that
the
girl
left
the
room
looked
at
madame
du
gua
and
her
surprise
increased
as
she
saw
the
pallor
on
the
face
of
her
enemy
anxious
to
discover
the
meaning
of
francine
s
abrupt
departure
she
went
to
the
window
where
madame
du
gua
followed
her
no
doubt
to
guard
against
any
suspicions
which
might
arise
in
her
mind
they
returned
together
to
the
chimney
after
each
had
cast
a
look
upon
the
shore
and
the
lake
marie
without
seeing
anything
that
could
have
caused
francine
s
flight
madame
du
gua
seeing
that
which
satisfied
her
she
was
being
obeyed
the
lake
at
the
edge
of
which
had
shown
his
head
where
madame
du
gua
had
seen
him
joined
the
moat
in
misty
curves
sometimes
broad
as
ponds
in
other
places
narrow
as
the
artificial
streamlets
of
a
park
the
steep
bank
washed
by
its
waters
lay
a
few
rods
from
the
window
francine
watching
on
the
surface
of
the
water
the
black
lines
thrown
by
the
willows
noticed
carelessly
at
first
the
uniform
trend
of
their
branches
caused
by
a
light
breeze
then
prevailing
suddenly
she
thought
she
saw
against
the
glassy
surface
a
figure
moving
with
the
spontaneous
and
irregular
motion
of
life
the
form
vague
as
it
was
seemed
to
her
that
of
a
man
at
first
she
attributed
what
she
saw
to
the
play
of
the
moonlight
upon
the
foliage
but
presently
a
second
head
appeared
then
several
others
in
the
distance
the
shrubs
upon
the
bank
were
bent
and
then
violently
straightened
and
francine
saw
the
long
hedge
undulating
like
one
of
those
great
indian
serpents
of
fabulous
size
and
shape
here
and
there
among
the
gorse
and
taller
brambles
points
of
light
could
be
seen
to
come
and
go
the
girl
s
attention
redoubled
and
she
thought
she
recognized
the
foremost
of
the
dusky
figures
indistinct
as
its
outlines
were
the
beating
of
her
heart
convinced
her
it
was
no
other
than
her
lover
eager
to
know
if
this
mysterious
approach
meant
treachery
she
ran
to
the
courtyard
when
she
reached
the
middle
of
its
grass
plot
she
looked
alternately
at
the
two
wings
of
the
building
and
along
the
steep
shores
without
discovering
on
the
inhabited
side
of
the
house
any
sign
of
this
silent
approach
she
listened
attentively
and
heard
a
slight
rustling
like
that
which
might
be
made
by
the
footfalls
of
some
wild
animal
in
the
silence
of
the
forest
she
quivered
but
did
not
tremble
though
young
and
innocent
her
anxious
curiosity
suggested
a
ruse
she
saw
the
coach
and
slipped
into
it
putting
out
her
head
to
listen
with
the
caution
of
a
hare
giving
ear
to
the
sound
of
the
distant
hunters
she
saw
come
out
of
the
stable
accompanied
by
two
peasants
all
three
carrying
bales
of
straw
these
they
spread
on
the
ground
in
a
way
to
form
a
long
bed
of
litter
before
the
inhabited
wing
of
the
house
parallel
with
the
bank
bordered
by
dwarf
trees
you
re
spreading
straw
as
if
you
thought
they
d
sleep
here
enough
enough
said
a
low
gruff
voice
which
francine
recognized
and
won
t
they
sleep
here
returned
with
a
laugh
i
m
afraid
the
gars
will
be
angry
he
added
too
low
for
francine
to
hear
well
let
him
said
in
the
same
tone
we
shall
have
killed
the
blues
anyway
here
s
that
coach
which
you
and
i
had
better
put
pulled
the
carriage
by
the
pole
and
pushed
it
by
one
of
the
wheels
with
such
force
that
francine
was
in
the
barn
and
about
to
be
locked
up
before
she
had
time
to
reflect
on
her
situation
went
out
to
fetch
the
barrel
of
cider
which
the
marquis
had
ordered
for
the
escort
and
was
passing
along
the
side
of
the
coach
to
leave
the
barn
and
close
the
door
when
he
was
stopped
by
a
hand
which
caught
and
held
the
long
hair
of
his
goatskin
he
recognized
a
pair
of
eyes
the
gentleness
of
which
exercised
a
power
of
magnetism
over
him
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
under
their
spell
francine
sprang
from
the
carriage
and
said
in
the
nervous
tone
of
an
excited
woman
pierre
what
news
did
you
give
to
that
lady
and
her
son
on
the
road
what
is
going
on
here
why
are
you
hiding
i
must
know
these
words
brought
a
look
on
the
chouan
s
face
which
francine
had
never
seen
there
before
the
breton
led
his
innocent
mistress
to
the
door
there
he
turned
her
towards
the
blanching
light
of
the
moon
and
answered
as
he
looked
in
her
face
with
terrifying
eyes
yes
by
my
damnation
francine
i
will
tell
you
but
not
until
you
have
sworn
on
these
beads
and
he
pulled
an
old
chaplet
from
beneath
his
goatskin
on
this
relic
which
know
he
continued
to
answer
me
truly
one
francine
colored
as
she
saw
the
chaplet
which
was
no
doubt
a
token
of
their
love
it
was
on
that
he
added
much
agitated
that
you
swore
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
the
young
girl
placed
her
hand
on
the
lips
of
her
savage
lover
and
silenced
him
need
i
swear
she
said
he
took
his
mistress
gently
by
the
hand
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
said
is
the
lady
you
are
with
really
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
francine
stood
with
hanging
arms
her
eyelids
lowered
her
head
bowed
pale
and
speechless
she
is
a
strumpet
cried
in
a
terrifying
voice
at
the
word
the
pretty
hand
once
more
covered
his
lips
but
this
time
he
sprang
back
violently
the
girl
no
longer
saw
a
lover
he
had
turned
to
a
wild
beast
in
all
the
fury
of
its
nature
his
eyebrows
were
drawn
together
his
lips
drew
apart
and
he
showed
his
teeth
like
a
dog
which
defends
its
master
i
left
you
pure
and
i
find
you
muck
ha
why
did
i
ever
leave
you
you
are
here
to
betray
us
to
deliver
up
the
gars
these
sentences
sounded
more
like
roars
than
words
though
francine
was
frightened
she
raised
her
angelic
eyes
at
this
last
accusation
and
answered
calmly
as
she
looked
into
his
savage
face
i
will
pledge
my
eternal
safety
that
that
is
false
that
s
an
idea
of
the
lady
you
are
he
lowered
his
head
then
she
took
his
hand
and
nestling
to
him
with
a
pretty
movement
said
pierre
what
is
all
this
to
you
and
me
i
don
t
know
what
you
understand
about
it
but
i
can
t
make
it
out
recollect
one
thing
that
noble
and
beautiful
young
lady
has
been
my
benefactress
she
is
also
yours
we
live
together
like
two
sisters
no
harm
must
ever
come
to
her
where
we
are
you
and
i
in
our
lifetime
at
least
swear
it
i
trust
no
one
here
but
i
don
t
command
here
said
the
chouan
in
a
surly
tone
his
face
darkened
she
caught
his
long
ears
and
twisted
them
gently
as
if
playing
with
a
cat
at
least
she
said
seeing
that
he
looked
less
stern
promise
me
to
use
all
the
power
you
have
to
protect
our
he
shook
his
head
as
if
he
doubted
of
success
and
the
motion
made
her
tremble
at
this
critical
moment
the
escort
was
entering
the
courtyard
the
tread
of
the
soldiers
and
the
rattle
of
their
weapons
awoke
the
echoes
and
seemed
to
put
an
end
to
s
indecision
perhaps
i
can
save
her
he
said
if
you
make
her
stay
in
the
house
and
mind
he
added
whatever
happens
you
must
stay
with
her
and
keep
silence
if
not
no
i
promise
it
she
replied
in
terror
very
good
then
go
in
go
in
at
once
and
hide
your
fears
from
every
one
even
your
she
pressed
his
hand
he
stood
for
a
moment
watching
her
with
an
almost
paternal
air
as
she
ran
with
the
lightness
of
a
bird
up
the
portico
then
he
slipped
behind
the
bushes
like
an
actor
darting
behind
the
scenes
as
the
curtain
rises
on
a
tragedy
do
you
know
merle
said
gerard
as
they
reached
the
chateau
that
this
place
looks
to
me
like
a
mousetrap
so
i
think
said
the
captain
anxiously
the
two
officers
hastened
to
post
sentinels
to
guard
the
gate
and
the
causeway
then
they
examined
with
great
distrust
the
precipitous
banks
of
the
lakes
and
the
surroundings
of
the
chateau
pooh
said
merle
we
must
do
one
of
two
things
either
trust
ourselves
in
this
barrack
with
perfect
confidence
or
else
not
enter
it
at
come
let
s
go
in
replied
gerard
the
soldiers
released
at
the
word
of
command
hastened
to
stack
their
muskets
in
conical
sheaves
and
to
form
a
sort
of
line
before
the
litter
of
straw
in
the
middle
of
which
was
the
promised
barrel
of
cider
they
then
divided
into
groups
to
whom
two
peasants
began
to
distribute
butter
and
the
marquis
appeared
in
the
portico
to
welcome
the
officers
and
take
them
to
the
salon
as
gerard
went
up
the
steps
he
looked
at
both
ends
of
the
portico
where
some
venerable
larches
spread
their
black
branches
and
he
called
up
and
you
will
each
reconnoitre
the
gardens
and
search
the
bushes
and
post
a
sentry
before
your
may
we
light
our
fire
before
starting
adjutant
asked
gerard
nodded
there
you
see
said
the
adjutant
s
wrong
to
run
himself
into
this
wasp
if
hulot
was
in
command
we
shouldn
t
be
cornered
here
in
a
saucepan
what
a
stupid
you
are
replied
haven
t
you
guessed
you
knave
of
tricks
that
this
is
the
home
of
the
beauty
our
jovial
merle
has
been
whistling
round
he
ll
marry
her
to
a
certainty
that
s
as
clear
as
a
bayonet
a
woman
like
that
will
do
honor
to
the
true
for
you
replied
and
you
may
add
that
she
gives
pretty
good
cider
but
i
can
t
drink
it
in
peace
till
i
know
what
s
behind
those
devilish
hedges
i
always
remember
poor
larose
and
rolling
down
the
ditch
at
la
pelerine
i
shall
recollect
larose
s
queue
to
the
end
of
my
days
it
went
hammering
down
like
the
knocker
of
a
front
my
friend
you
have
too
much
imagination
for
a
soldier
you
ought
to
be
making
songs
at
the
national
if
i
ve
too
much
imagination
retorted
you
haven
t
any
it
will
take
you
some
time
to
get
your
degree
as
a
general
laugh
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
for
found
no
suitable
reply
in
his
pouch
with
which
to
floor
his
adversary
come
and
make
our
rounds
i
ll
go
to
the
right
said
very
good
i
ll
take
the
left
replied
his
comrade
but
stop
one
minute
i
must
have
a
glass
of
cider
my
throat
is
glued
together
like
the
of
hulot
s
best
the
left
bank
of
the
gardens
which
thus
delayed
searching
at
once
was
unhappily
the
dangerous
slope
where
francine
had
seen
the
moving
line
of
men
all
things
go
by
chance
in
war
as
gerard
entered
the
salon
and
bowed
to
the
company
he
cast
a
penetrating
eye
on
the
men
who
were
present
suspicions
came
forcibly
to
his
mind
and
he
went
at
once
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
think
you
had
better
leave
this
place
immediately
we
are
not
safe
what
can
you
fear
while
i
am
with
you
she
answered
laughing
you
are
safer
here
than
you
would
be
at
a
woman
answers
for
her
lover
in
good
faith
the
two
officers
were
reassured
the
party
now
moved
into
the
after
some
discussion
about
a
guest
apparently
of
some
importance
who
had
not
appeared
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
able
thanks
to
the
silence
which
always
reigns
at
the
beginning
of
a
meal
to
give
some
attention
to
the
character
of
the
assemblage
which
was
curious
enough
under
existing
circumstances
one
thing
struck
her
with
surprise
the
republican
officers
seemed
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
assembly
by
reason
of
their
dignified
appearance
their
long
hair
tied
behind
in
a
queue
drew
lines
beside
their
foreheads
which
gave
in
those
days
an
expression
of
great
candor
and
nobleness
to
young
heads
their
threadbare
blue
uniforms
with
the
shabby
red
facings
even
their
epaulets
flung
back
behind
their
shoulders
a
sign
throughout
the
army
even
among
the
leaders
of
a
lack
of
overcoats
all
these
things
brought
the
two
republican
officers
into
strong
relief
against
the
men
who
surrounded
them
oh
they
are
the
nation
and
that
means
liberty
thought
marie
then
with
a
glance
at
the
royalists
she
added
on
the
other
side
is
a
man
a
king
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
admiring
merle
so
thoroughly
did
that
gay
soldier
respond
to
the
ideas
she
had
formed
of
the
french
trooper
who
hums
a
tune
when
the
balls
are
whistling
and
jests
when
a
comrade
falls
gerard
was
more
imposing
grave
and
he
seemed
to
have
one
of
those
truly
republican
spirits
which
in
the
days
of
which
we
write
crowded
the
french
armies
and
gave
them
by
means
of
these
noble
individual
devotions
an
energy
which
they
had
never
before
possessed
that
is
one
of
my
men
with
great
ideals
thought
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
relying
on
the
present
which
they
rule
they
destroy
the
past
for
the
benefit
of
the
the
thought
saddened
her
because
she
could
not
apply
it
to
her
lover
towards
whom
she
now
turned
to
discard
by
a
different
admiration
these
beliefs
in
the
republic
she
was
already
beginning
to
dislike
looking
at
the
marquis
surrounded
by
men
who
were
bold
enough
fanatical
enough
and
sufficiently
as
to
the
future
to
give
battle
to
a
victorious
republic
in
the
hope
of
restoring
a
dead
monarchy
a
proscribed
religion
fugitive
princes
and
lost
privileges
he
thought
she
has
no
less
an
aim
than
the
others
clinging
to
those
fragments
he
wants
to
make
a
future
from
the
her
mind
thus
grasped
by
conflicting
images
hesitated
between
the
new
and
the
old
wrecks
her
conscience
told
her
that
the
one
was
fighting
for
a
man
the
other
for
a
country
but
she
had
now
reached
through
her
feelings
the
point
to
which
reason
will
also
bring
us
namely
to
a
recognition
that
the
king
the
nation
the
steps
of
a
man
echoed
in
the
adjoining
room
and
the
marquis
rose
from
the
table
to
greet
him
he
proved
to
be
the
expected
guest
and
seeing
the
assembled
company
he
was
about
to
speak
when
the
gars
made
him
a
hasty
sign
which
he
concealed
from
the
republicans
to
take
his
place
and
say
nothing
the
more
the
two
officers
analyzed
the
faces
about
them
the
more
their
suspicions
increased
the
clerical
dress
of
the
abbe
gudin
and
the
singularity
of
the
chouan
garments
were
so
many
warnings
to
them
they
redoubled
their
watchfulness
and
soon
discovered
many
discrepancies
between
the
manners
of
the
guests
and
the
topics
of
their
conversation
the
republicanism
of
some
was
quite
as
exaggerated
as
the
aristocratic
bearing
of
others
was
unmistakable
certain
glances
which
they
detected
between
the
marquis
and
his
guests
certain
words
of
double
meaning
imprudently
uttered
but
above
all
the
fringe
of
beard
which
was
round
the
necks
of
several
of
the
men
and
was
very
by
their
cravats
brought
the
officers
at
last
to
a
full
conviction
of
the
truth
which
flashed
upon
their
minds
at
the
same
instant
they
gave
each
other
one
look
for
madame
du
gua
had
cleverly
separated
them
and
they
could
only
impart
their
thoughts
by
their
eyes
such
a
situation
demanded
the
utmost
caution
they
did
not
know
whether
they
and
their
men
were
masters
of
the
situation
or
whether
they
had
been
drawn
into
a
trap
or
whether
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
the
dupe
or
the
accomplice
of
this
inexplicable
state
of
things
but
an
unforeseen
event
precipitated
a
crisis
before
they
had
fully
recognized
the
gravity
of
their
situation
the
new
guest
was
one
of
those
solid
men
who
are
square
at
the
base
and
square
at
the
shoulders
with
ruddy
skins
men
who
lean
backward
when
they
walk
seeming
to
displace
much
atmosphere
about
them
and
who
appear
to
think
that
more
than
one
glance
of
the
eye
is
needful
to
take
them
in
notwithstanding
his
rank
he
had
taken
life
as
a
joke
from
which
he
was
to
get
as
much
amusement
as
possible
and
yet
although
he
knelt
at
his
own
shrine
only
he
was
kind
polite
and
witty
after
the
fashion
of
those
noblemen
who
having
finished
their
training
at
court
return
to
live
on
their
estates
and
never
suspect
that
they
have
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
grown
rusty
men
of
this
type
fail
in
tact
with
imperturbable
coolness
talk
folly
wittily
distrust
good
with
extreme
shrewdness
and
take
incredible
pains
to
fall
into
traps
when
by
a
play
of
his
knife
and
fork
which
proclaimed
him
a
good
feeder
he
had
made
up
for
lost
time
he
began
to
look
round
on
the
company
his
astonishment
was
great
when
he
observed
the
two
republican
officers
and
he
questioned
madame
du
gua
with
a
look
while
she
for
all
answer
showed
him
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
in
the
same
way
when
he
saw
the
siren
whose
demeanor
had
silenced
the
suspicions
madame
du
gua
had
excited
among
the
guests
the
face
of
the
stout
stranger
broke
into
one
of
those
insolent
ironical
smiles
which
contain
a
whole
history
of
scandal
he
leaned
to
his
next
neighbor
and
whispered
a
few
words
which
went
from
ear
to
ear
and
lip
to
lip
passing
marie
and
the
two
officers
until
they
reached
the
heart
of
one
whom
they
struck
to
death
the
leaders
of
the
vendeans
and
the
chouans
assembled
round
that
table
looked
at
the
marquis
de
montauran
with
cruel
curiosity
the
eyes
of
madame
du
gua
flashing
with
joy
turned
from
the
marquis
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
was
speechless
with
surprise
the
republican
officers
uneasy
in
mind
questioned
each
other
s
thoughts
as
they
awaited
the
result
of
this
extraordinary
scene
in
a
moment
the
forks
remained
inactive
in
every
hand
silence
reigned
and
every
eye
was
turned
to
the
gars
a
frightful
anger
showed
upon
his
face
which
turned
waxen
in
tone
he
leaned
towards
the
guest
from
whom
the
rocket
had
started
and
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
muffled
in
crape
death
of
my
soul
count
is
that
true
on
my
honor
said
the
count
bowing
gravely
the
marquis
lowered
his
eyes
for
a
moment
then
he
raised
them
and
looked
fixedly
at
marie
who
watchful
of
his
struggle
knew
that
look
to
be
her
i
would
give
my
life
he
said
in
a
low
voice
for
revenge
on
the
madame
du
gua
understood
the
words
from
the
mere
movement
of
the
young
man
s
lips
and
she
smiled
upon
him
as
we
smile
at
a
friend
whose
regrets
are
about
to
cease
the
scorn
felt
for
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
shown
on
every
face
brought
to
its
height
the
growing
indignation
of
the
two
republicans
who
now
rose
hastily
do
you
want
anything
citizens
asked
madame
du
gua
our
swords
said
gerard
sarcastically
you
do
not
need
them
at
table
said
the
marquis
coldly
no
but
we
are
going
to
play
at
a
game
you
know
very
well
replied
gerard
this
is
la
pelerine
over
the
whole
party
seemed
dumfounded
just
then
a
volley
fired
with
terrible
regularity
echoed
through
the
courtyard
the
two
officers
sprang
to
the
portico
there
they
beheld
a
hundred
or
so
of
chouans
aiming
at
the
few
soldiers
who
were
not
shot
down
at
the
first
discharge
these
they
fired
upon
as
upon
so
many
hares
the
bretons
swarmed
from
the
bank
where
had
posted
them
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
for
after
the
last
volley
and
mingling
with
the
cries
of
the
dying
several
chouans
were
heard
to
fall
into
the
lake
where
they
were
lost
like
stones
in
a
gulf
took
aim
at
gerard
held
merle
at
his
mercy
captain
said
the
marquis
to
merle
repeating
to
the
republican
his
own
words
you
see
that
men
are
like
medlars
they
ripen
on
the
he
pointed
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
the
entire
escort
of
the
blues
lying
on
the
bloody
litter
where
the
chouans
were
despatching
those
who
still
breathed
and
rifling
the
dead
bodies
with
incredible
rapidity
i
was
right
when
i
told
you
that
your
soldiers
will
not
get
as
far
as
la
pelerine
i
think
moreover
that
your
head
will
fill
with
lead
before
mine
what
say
you
montauran
felt
a
horrible
necessity
to
vent
his
rage
his
bitter
sarcasm
the
ferocity
even
the
treachery
of
this
military
execution
done
without
his
orders
but
which
he
now
accepted
satisfied
in
some
degree
the
craving
of
his
heart
in
his
fury
he
would
fain
have
annihilated
france
the
dead
blues
the
living
officers
all
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
demanded
vengeance
were
to
him
the
cards
by
which
a
gambler
cheats
his
despair
i
would
rather
perish
than
conquer
as
you
are
conquering
said
gerard
then
seeing
the
naked
and
bloody
corpses
of
his
men
he
cried
out
murdered
basely
in
cold
blood
that
was
how
you
murdered
louis
monsieur
said
the
marquis
monsieur
replied
gerard
haughtily
there
are
mysteries
in
a
king
s
trial
which
you
could
never
do
you
dare
to
accuse
the
king
exclaimed
the
marquis
do
you
dare
to
fight
your
country
retorted
gerard
folly
said
the
marquis
parricide
exclaimed
the
republican
well
well
cried
merle
gaily
a
pretty
time
to
quarrel
at
the
moment
of
your
true
said
gerard
coldly
turning
to
the
marquis
monsieur
if
it
is
your
intention
to
put
us
to
death
at
least
have
the
goodness
to
shoot
us
at
ah
that
s
like
you
gerard
said
merle
always
in
a
hurry
to
finish
things
but
if
one
has
to
travel
far
and
can
t
breakfast
on
the
morrow
at
least
we
might
gerard
sprang
forward
without
a
word
towards
the
wall
covered
him
glancing
as
he
did
so
at
the
motionless
marquis
whose
silence
he
took
for
an
order
and
the
fell
like
a
tree
ran
to
share
the
fresh
booty
with
like
two
hungry
crows
they
disputed
and
clamored
over
the
still
warm
body
if
you
really
wish
to
finish
your
supper
captain
you
can
come
with
me
said
the
marquis
to
merle
the
captain
followed
him
mechanically
saying
in
a
low
voice
it
is
that
devil
of
a
strumpet
that
caused
all
this
what
will
hulot
say
strumpet
cried
the
marquis
in
a
strangled
voice
then
she
is
one
the
captain
seemed
to
have
given
montauran
a
for
he
the
house
with
a
staggering
step
pale
haggard
and
undone
another
scene
had
meanwhile
taken
place
in
the
which
assumed
in
the
marquis
s
absence
such
a
threatening
character
that
marie
alone
without
her
protector
might
well
fancy
she
read
her
in
the
eyes
of
her
rival
at
the
noise
of
the
volley
the
guests
all
sprang
to
their
feet
but
madame
du
gua
remained
seated
it
is
nothing
she
said
our
men
are
despatching
the
then
seeing
the
marquis
outside
on
the
portico
she
rose
mademoiselle
whom
you
here
see
she
continued
with
the
calmness
of
concentrated
fury
came
here
to
betray
the
gars
she
meant
to
deliver
him
up
to
the
i
could
have
done
so
twenty
times
and
yet
i
saved
his
life
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
madame
du
gua
sprang
upon
her
rival
like
lightning
in
her
blind
excitement
she
tore
apart
the
fastenings
of
the
young
girl
s
spencer
the
stuff
the
embroidery
the
corset
the
chemise
and
plunged
her
savage
hand
into
the
bosom
where
as
she
well
knew
a
letter
lay
hidden
in
doing
this
her
jealousy
so
bruised
and
tore
the
palpitating
throat
of
her
rival
taken
by
surprise
at
the
sudden
attack
that
she
left
the
bloody
marks
of
her
nails
feeling
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
making
her
submit
to
so
degrading
a
prostitution
in
the
feeble
struggle
which
marie
made
against
the
furious
woman
her
hair
became
unfastened
and
fell
in
undulating
curls
about
her
shoulders
her
face
glowed
with
outraged
modesty
and
tears
made
their
burning
way
along
her
cheeks
heightening
the
brilliancy
of
her
eyes
as
she
quivered
with
shame
before
the
looks
of
the
assembled
men
the
hardest
judge
would
have
believed
in
her
innocence
when
he
saw
her
sorrow
hatred
is
so
uncalculating
that
madame
du
gua
did
not
perceive
she
had
overshot
her
mark
and
that
no
one
listened
to
her
as
she
cried
triumphantly
you
shall
now
see
gentlemen
whether
i
have
slandered
that
horrible
not
so
horrible
said
the
bass
voice
of
the
guest
who
had
thrown
the
first
stone
but
for
my
part
i
like
such
here
continued
the
cruel
woman
is
an
order
signed
by
laplace
and
by
dubois
minister
of
at
these
names
several
heads
were
turned
to
her
listen
to
the
wording
of
it
she
went
on
the
military
citizen
commanders
of
all
grades
the
district
administrators
the
et
cetera
of
the
insurgent
departments
and
particularly
those
of
the
localities
in
which
the
marquis
de
montauran
leader
of
the
brigands
and
otherwise
known
as
the
gars
may
be
found
are
hereby
commanded
to
give
aid
and
assistance
to
the
marie
verneuil
and
to
obey
the
orders
which
she
may
give
them
at
her
a
worthless
hussy
takes
a
noble
name
to
soil
it
with
such
treachery
added
madame
du
gua
a
movement
of
astonishment
ran
through
the
assembly
the
fight
is
not
even
if
the
republic
employs
such
pretty
women
against
us
said
the
baron
du
guenic
gaily
especially
women
who
have
nothing
to
lose
said
madame
du
gua
nothing
cried
the
chevalier
du
vissard
mademoiselle
has
a
property
which
probably
brings
her
in
a
pretty
good
the
republic
must
like
a
joke
to
send
strumpets
for
ambassadors
said
the
abbe
gudin
unfortunately
mademoiselle
seeks
the
joys
that
kill
said
madame
du
gua
with
a
horrible
expression
of
pleasure
at
the
end
she
foresaw
then
why
are
you
still
living
said
her
victim
rising
to
her
feet
after
repairing
the
disorder
of
her
clothes
this
bitter
sarcasm
excited
a
sort
of
respect
for
so
brave
a
victim
and
silenced
the
assembly
madame
du
gua
saw
a
satirical
smile
on
the
lips
of
the
men
which
infuriated
her
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
marquis
and
merle
who
were
entering
the
room
she
called
to
the
chouan
who
followed
them
she
said
pointing
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
take
her
she
is
my
share
of
the
booty
and
i
turn
her
over
to
you
do
what
you
like
with
at
these
words
the
whole
assembly
shuddered
for
the
hideous
heads
of
and
appeared
behind
the
marquis
and
the
punishment
was
seen
in
all
its
horror
francine
was
standing
with
clasped
hands
as
though
paralyzed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
before
the
danger
that
threatened
her
cast
a
look
of
contempt
at
the
assembled
men
snatched
the
letter
from
madame
du
gua
s
hand
threw
up
her
head
with
a
flashing
eye
and
darted
towards
the
door
where
merle
s
sword
was
still
leaning
there
she
came
upon
the
marquis
cold
and
motionless
as
a
statue
nothing
pleaded
for
her
on
his
fixed
firm
features
wounded
to
the
heart
life
seemed
odious
to
her
the
man
who
had
pledged
her
so
much
love
must
have
heard
the
odious
jests
that
were
cast
upon
her
and
stood
there
silently
a
witness
of
the
infamy
she
had
been
made
to
endure
she
might
perhaps
have
forgiven
him
his
contempt
but
she
could
not
forgive
his
having
seen
her
in
so
humiliating
a
position
and
she
flung
him
a
look
that
was
full
of
hatred
feeling
in
her
heart
the
birth
of
an
unutterable
desire
for
vengeance
with
death
beside
her
the
sense
of
impotence
almost
strangled
her
a
whirlwind
of
passion
and
madness
rose
in
her
head
the
blood
which
boiled
in
her
veins
made
everything
about
her
seem
like
a
conflagration
instead
of
killing
herself
she
seized
the
sword
and
thrust
it
though
the
marquis
but
the
weapon
slipped
between
his
arm
and
side
he
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
dragged
her
from
the
room
aided
by
who
had
flung
himself
upon
the
furious
creature
when
she
attacked
his
master
francine
shrieked
aloud
pierre
pierre
pierre
she
cried
in
tones
as
she
followed
her
mistress
the
marquis
closed
the
door
on
the
astonished
company
when
he
reached
the
portico
he
was
still
holding
the
woman
s
wrist
which
he
clasped
convulsively
while
had
almost
crushed
the
bones
of
her
arm
with
his
iron
fingers
but
marie
felt
only
the
burning
hand
of
the
young
leader
you
hurt
me
she
said
for
all
answer
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
have
you
some
base
revenge
to
take
like
that
woman
she
said
then
seeing
the
dead
bodies
on
the
heap
of
straw
she
cried
out
shuddering
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
ha
ha
ha
with
a
frightful
laugh
she
added
ha
the
glorious
day
yes
he
said
a
day
without
a
he
let
go
her
hand
and
took
a
long
last
look
at
the
beautiful
creature
he
could
scarcely
even
then
renounce
neither
of
these
proud
natures
yielded
the
marquis
may
have
looked
for
a
tear
but
the
eyes
of
the
girl
were
dry
and
scornful
then
he
turned
quickly
and
left
the
victim
to
god
will
hear
me
marquis
she
called
i
will
ask
him
to
give
you
a
glorious
day
without
a
not
a
little
embarrassed
with
so
rich
a
prize
dragged
her
away
with
some
gentleness
and
a
mixture
of
respect
and
scorn
the
marquis
with
a
sigh
the
his
face
like
that
of
a
dead
man
whose
eyes
have
not
been
closed
merle
s
presence
was
inexplicable
to
the
silent
spectators
of
this
tragedy
they
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
their
eyes
questioned
each
other
merle
saw
their
amazement
and
true
to
his
native
character
he
said
with
a
smile
gentlemen
you
will
scarcely
refuse
a
glass
of
wine
to
a
man
who
is
about
to
make
his
last
it
was
just
as
the
company
had
calmed
down
under
the
influence
of
these
words
said
with
a
true
french
carelessness
which
pleased
the
vendeans
that
montauran
returned
his
face
pale
his
eyes
fixed
now
you
shall
see
said
merle
how
death
can
make
men
ah
said
the
marquis
with
a
gesture
as
if
suddenly
awaking
here
you
are
my
dear
councillor
of
war
and
he
passed
him
a
bottle
of
de
oh
thanks
citizen
marquis
replied
merle
now
i
can
divert
at
this
sally
madame
du
gua
turned
to
the
other
guests
with
a
smile
saying
let
us
spare
him
the
that
is
a
very
cruel
vengeance
madame
he
said
you
forget
my
murdered
friend
who
is
waiting
for
me
i
never
miss
an
captain
said
the
marquis
throwing
him
his
glove
you
are
free
that
s
your
passport
the
chasseurs
du
roi
know
that
they
must
not
kill
all
the
so
much
the
better
for
me
replied
merle
but
you
are
making
a
mistake
we
shall
come
to
close
quarters
before
long
and
i
ll
not
let
you
off
though
your
head
can
never
pay
for
gerard
s
i
want
it
and
i
shall
have
it
adieu
i
could
drink
with
my
own
assassins
but
i
can
not
stay
with
those
of
my
friend
and
he
disappeared
leaving
the
guests
astonished
at
his
coolness
well
gentlemen
what
do
you
think
of
the
lawyers
and
surgeons
and
bailiffs
who
manage
the
republic
said
the
gars
coldly
god
marquis
replied
the
comte
de
bauvan
they
have
shocking
manners
that
fellow
presumed
to
be
impertinent
it
seems
to
the
captain
s
hasty
retreat
had
a
motive
the
despised
humiliated
woman
who
was
even
then
perhaps
being
put
to
death
had
so
won
upon
him
during
the
scene
of
her
degradation
that
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
the
room
if
she
is
a
prostitute
she
is
not
an
ordinary
one
and
i
ll
marry
he
felt
so
sure
of
being
able
to
rescue
her
from
the
savages
that
his
first
thought
when
his
own
life
was
given
to
him
was
to
save
hers
unhappily
when
he
reached
the
portico
he
found
the
courtyard
deserted
he
looked
about
him
listened
to
the
silence
and
could
hear
nothing
but
the
distant
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
chouans
who
were
drinking
in
the
gardens
and
dividing
their
booty
he
turned
the
corner
to
the
fatal
wing
before
which
his
men
had
been
shot
and
from
there
he
could
distinguish
by
the
feeble
light
of
a
few
stray
lanterns
the
different
groups
of
the
chasseurs
du
roi
neither
nor
nor
the
girl
were
visible
but
he
felt
himself
gently
pulled
by
the
flap
of
his
uniform
and
turning
round
saw
francine
on
her
knees
where
is
she
he
asked
i
don
t
know
pierre
drove
me
back
and
told
me
not
to
stir
from
which
way
did
they
go
that
way
she
replied
pointing
to
the
causeway
the
captain
and
francine
then
noticed
in
that
direction
a
line
of
strong
shadows
thrown
by
the
moonlight
on
the
lake
and
among
them
that
of
a
female
figure
it
is
she
cried
francine
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
seemed
to
be
standing
as
if
resigned
in
the
midst
of
other
figures
whose
gestures
denoted
a
debate
there
are
several
said
the
captain
well
no
matter
let
us
go
to
you
will
get
yourself
killed
uselessly
said
francine
i
have
been
killed
once
before
he
said
gaily
they
both
walked
towards
the
gloomy
gateway
which
led
to
the
causeway
there
francine
suddenly
stopped
short
no
she
said
gently
i
ll
go
no
farther
pierre
told
me
not
to
meddle
i
believe
in
him
if
we
go
on
we
shall
spoil
all
do
as
you
please
officer
but
leave
me
if
pierre
saw
us
together
he
would
kill
just
then
appeared
in
the
gateway
and
called
to
the
postilion
who
was
left
in
the
stable
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
the
captain
and
covered
him
with
his
musket
shouting
out
by
saint
anne
of
auray
the
rector
was
right
enough
in
telling
us
the
blues
had
signed
a
compact
with
the
devil
i
ll
bring
you
to
life
i
will
stop
my
life
is
sacred
cried
merle
seeing
his
danger
there
s
the
glove
of
your
gars
and
he
held
it
out
ghosts
lives
are
not
sacred
replied
the
chouan
and
i
sha
n
t
give
you
yours
ave
maria
he
fired
and
the
ball
passed
through
his
victim
s
head
the
captain
fell
when
francine
reached
him
she
heard
him
mutter
the
words
i
d
rather
die
with
them
than
return
without
the
chouan
sprang
upon
the
body
to
strip
it
saying
there
s
one
good
thing
about
ghosts
they
come
to
life
in
their
then
recognizing
the
gars
glove
that
sacred
safeguard
in
the
captain
s
hand
he
stopped
short
terrified
i
wish
i
wasn
t
in
the
skin
of
my
mother
s
son
he
exclaimed
as
he
turned
and
disappeared
with
the
rapidity
of
a
bird
to
understand
this
scene
so
fatal
to
poor
merle
we
must
follow
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
after
the
marquis
in
his
fury
and
despair
had
abandoned
her
to
francine
had
caught
by
the
arm
and
reminded
him
with
sobs
of
the
promise
he
had
made
her
was
already
dragging
away
his
victim
like
a
heavy
bundle
marie
her
head
and
hair
hanging
back
turned
her
eyes
to
the
lake
but
held
as
she
was
in
a
grasp
of
iron
she
was
forced
to
follow
the
chouan
who
turned
now
and
then
to
hasten
her
steps
and
each
time
that
he
did
so
a
jovial
thought
brought
a
hideous
smile
upon
his
face
isn
t
she
a
morsel
he
cried
with
a
coarse
laugh
hearing
the
words
francine
recovered
speech
pierre
well
what
he
ll
kill
not
at
then
she
ll
kill
herself
she
will
never
submit
and
if
she
dies
i
shall
die
then
you
love
her
too
much
and
she
shall
die
said
pierre
if
we
are
rich
and
happy
we
owe
it
all
to
her
but
whether
or
no
you
promised
me
to
save
well
i
ll
try
but
you
must
stay
here
and
don
t
francine
at
once
let
go
his
arm
and
waited
in
horrible
suspense
in
the
courtyard
where
merle
found
her
meantime
joined
his
comrade
at
the
moment
when
the
latter
after
dragging
his
victim
to
the
barn
was
compelling
her
to
get
into
the
coach
called
to
him
to
help
in
pulling
out
the
vehicle
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
all
that
asked
the
grande
garce
gave
me
the
woman
and
all
that
belongs
to
her
is
the
coach
will
put
a
sou
or
two
in
your
pocket
but
as
for
the
woman
she
ll
scratch
your
eyes
out
like
a
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
then
i
ll
tie
her
up
and
take
her
home
he
answered
very
good
suppose
we
harness
the
horses
said
a
few
moments
later
who
had
left
his
comrade
mounting
guard
over
his
prey
led
the
coach
from
the
stable
to
the
causeway
where
got
into
it
beside
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
not
perceiving
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
spring
into
the
lake
i
say
cried
what
i
ll
buy
all
your
are
you
joking
asked
the
other
catching
his
prisoner
by
the
petticoat
as
a
butcher
catches
a
calf
that
is
trying
to
escape
him
let
me
see
her
and
i
ll
set
a
the
unfortunate
creature
was
made
to
leave
the
coach
and
stand
between
the
two
chouans
who
each
held
a
hand
and
looked
at
her
as
the
elders
must
have
looked
at
susannah
will
you
take
thirty
francs
in
good
coin
said
with
a
groan
really
done
said
holding
out
his
hand
yes
done
i
can
get
plenty
of
breton
girls
for
that
and
choice
morsels
too
but
the
coach
whose
is
that
asked
beginning
to
reflect
upon
his
bargain
mine
cried
in
a
terrible
tone
of
voice
which
showed
the
sort
of
superiority
his
ferocious
character
gave
him
over
his
companions
but
suppose
there
s
money
in
the
coach
didn
t
you
say
done
yes
i
said
very
good
then
go
and
fetch
the
postilion
who
is
gagged
in
the
stable
over
but
if
there
s
money
in
the
is
there
any
asked
roughly
shaking
marie
by
the
arm
yes
about
a
hundred
the
two
chouans
looked
at
each
other
well
well
friend
said
we
won
t
quarrel
for
a
female
blue
let
s
pitch
her
into
the
lake
with
a
stone
around
her
neck
and
divide
the
i
ll
give
you
that
money
as
my
share
in
d
orgemont
s
ransom
said
smothering
a
groan
caused
by
such
sacrifice
uttered
a
sort
of
hoarse
cry
as
he
started
to
find
the
postilion
and
his
glee
brought
death
to
merle
whom
he
met
on
his
way
hearing
the
shot
rushed
in
the
direction
where
he
had
left
francine
and
found
her
praying
on
her
knees
with
clasped
hands
beside
the
poor
captain
whose
murder
had
deeply
horrified
her
run
to
your
mistress
said
the
chouan
she
is
he
ran
himself
to
fetch
the
postilion
returning
with
all
speed
and
as
he
repassed
merle
s
body
he
noticed
the
gars
glove
which
was
still
convulsively
clasped
in
the
dead
hand
oho
he
cried
has
blundered
horribly
he
won
t
live
to
spend
his
he
snatched
up
the
glove
and
said
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
was
already
in
the
coach
with
francine
here
take
this
glove
if
any
of
our
men
attack
you
on
the
road
call
out
ho
the
gars
show
the
glove
and
no
harm
can
happen
to
you
francine
he
said
turning
towards
her
and
seizing
her
violently
you
and
i
are
quits
with
that
woman
come
with
me
and
let
the
devil
have
you
can
t
ask
me
to
abandon
her
just
at
this
moment
cried
francine
in
distress
scratched
his
ear
and
forehead
then
he
raised
his
head
and
his
mistress
saw
the
ferocious
expression
of
his
eyes
you
are
right
he
said
i
leave
you
with
her
one
week
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
don
t
come
with
me
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
but
he
slapped
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
after
making
the
gesture
of
taking
aim
at
her
he
disappeared
without
waiting
for
her
reply
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
a
voice
which
seemed
to
issue
from
the
lake
called
in
a
muffled
tone
madame
madame
the
postilion
and
the
two
women
shuddered
for
several
corpses
were
floating
near
them
a
blue
hidden
behind
a
tree
cautiously
appeared
let
me
get
up
behind
the
coach
or
i
m
a
dead
man
that
damned
cider
which
would
stop
to
drink
cost
more
than
a
pint
of
blood
if
he
had
done
as
i
did
and
made
his
round
our
poor
comrades
there
wouldn
t
be
floating
dead
in
the
while
these
events
were
taking
place
outside
the
chateau
the
leaders
sent
by
the
vendeans
and
those
of
the
chouans
were
holding
a
council
of
war
with
their
glasses
in
their
hands
under
the
presidency
of
the
marquis
de
montauran
frequent
libations
of
bordeaux
animated
the
discussion
which
however
became
more
serious
and
important
at
the
end
of
the
meal
after
the
general
plan
of
military
operations
had
been
decided
on
the
royalists
drank
to
the
health
of
the
bourbons
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
shot
which
killed
merle
was
heard
like
an
echo
of
the
disastrous
war
which
these
gay
and
noble
conspirators
were
about
to
make
against
the
republic
madame
du
gua
quivered
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
she
was
freed
from
her
rival
the
guests
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
the
marquis
rose
from
the
table
and
went
out
he
loved
her
said
madame
du
gua
sarcastically
follow
him
monsieur
de
fontaine
and
keep
him
company
he
will
be
as
irritating
as
a
fly
if
we
let
him
she
went
to
a
window
which
looked
on
the
courtyard
to
endeavor
to
see
marie
s
body
there
by
the
last
gleams
of
the
sinking
moon
she
caught
sight
of
the
coach
being
rapidly
driven
down
the
avenue
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
veil
was
fluttering
in
the
wind
madame
du
gua
furious
at
the
sight
left
the
room
hurriedly
the
marquis
standing
on
the
portico
absorbed
in
gloomy
thought
was
watching
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
chouans
who
having
divided
their
booty
in
the
gardens
were
now
returning
to
finish
the
cider
and
the
provided
for
the
blues
these
soldiers
of
a
new
species
on
whom
the
monarchy
was
resting
its
hopes
dispersed
into
groups
some
drank
the
cider
others
on
the
bank
before
the
portico
amused
themselves
by
flinging
into
the
lake
the
dead
bodies
of
the
blues
to
which
they
fastened
stones
this
sight
joined
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
strange
scene
the
fantastic
dress
the
savage
expressions
of
the
barbarous
and
uncouth
was
so
new
and
so
amazing
to
monsieur
de
fontaine
accustomed
to
the
nobler
and
appearance
of
the
vendean
troops
that
he
seized
the
occasion
to
say
to
the
marquis
de
montauran
what
do
you
expect
to
do
with
such
brutes
not
very
much
my
dear
count
replied
the
gars
will
they
ever
be
fit
to
manoeuvre
before
the
enemy
can
they
understand
or
execute
an
order
then
what
good
will
they
be
to
you
they
will
help
me
to
plunge
my
sword
into
the
entrails
of
the
republic
replied
the
marquis
in
a
thundering
voice
they
will
give
me
fougeres
in
three
days
and
all
brittany
in
ten
monsieur
he
added
in
a
gentler
voice
start
at
once
for
la
vendee
if
d
auticamp
suzannet
and
the
abbe
bernier
will
act
as
rapidly
as
i
do
if
they
ll
not
negotiate
with
the
first
consul
as
i
am
afraid
they
will
here
he
wrung
the
hand
of
the
vendean
chief
we
shall
be
within
reach
of
paris
in
a
but
the
republic
is
sending
sixty
thousand
men
and
general
brune
against
sixty
thousand
men
indeed
cried
the
marquis
with
a
scoffing
laugh
and
how
will
bonaparte
carry
on
the
italian
campaign
as
for
general
brune
he
is
not
coming
the
first
consul
has
sent
him
against
the
english
in
holland
and
general
hedouville
friend
of
our
friend
takes
his
place
here
do
you
understand
as
monsieur
de
fontaine
heard
these
words
he
gave
montauran
a
look
of
keen
intelligence
which
seemed
to
say
that
the
marquis
had
not
himself
understood
the
real
meaning
of
the
words
addressed
to
him
the
two
leaders
then
comprehended
each
other
perfectly
and
the
gars
replied
with
an
undefinable
smile
to
the
thoughts
expressed
in
both
their
eyes
monsieur
de
fontaine
do
you
know
my
arms
our
motto
is
persevere
unto
the
comte
de
fontaine
took
montauran
s
hand
and
pressed
it
saying
i
was
left
for
dead
at
therefore
you
need
never
doubt
me
but
believe
in
my
experience
times
have
yes
said
la
billardiere
who
now
joined
them
you
are
young
marquis
listen
to
me
your
property
has
not
yet
been
sold
ah
cried
montauran
can
you
conceive
of
devotion
without
sacrifice
do
you
really
know
the
king
i
then
i
admire
your
the
king
replied
the
young
chieftain
is
the
priest
i
am
fighting
not
for
the
man
but
for
the
they
parted
the
vendean
leader
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
yielding
to
circumstances
and
keeping
his
beliefs
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
la
billardiere
to
return
to
his
negotiations
in
england
and
montauran
to
fight
savagely
and
compel
the
vendeans
by
the
victories
he
expected
to
win
to
in
his
enterprise
the
events
of
the
day
had
excited
such
violent
emotions
in
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
whole
being
that
she
lay
back
almost
fainting
in
the
carriage
after
giving
the
order
to
drive
to
fougeres
francine
was
as
silent
as
her
mistress
the
postilion
dreading
some
new
disaster
made
all
the
haste
he
could
to
reach
the
and
was
soon
on
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
through
the
thick
white
mists
of
morning
marie
de
verneuil
crossed
the
broad
and
beautiful
valley
of
couesnon
where
this
history
began
scarcely
able
to
distinguish
the
slaty
rock
on
which
the
town
of
fougeres
stands
from
the
slopes
of
la
pelerine
they
were
still
eight
miles
from
it
shivering
with
cold
herself
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
recollected
the
poor
soldier
behind
the
carriage
and
insisted
against
his
remonstrances
in
taking
him
into
the
carriage
beside
francine
the
sight
of
fougeres
drew
her
for
a
time
out
of
her
reflections
the
sentinels
stationed
at
the
porte
refused
to
allow
ingress
to
the
strangers
and
she
was
therefore
obliged
to
exhibit
the
ministerial
order
this
at
once
gave
her
safety
in
entering
the
town
but
the
postilion
could
find
no
other
place
for
her
to
stop
at
than
the
poste
inn
madame
said
the
blue
whose
life
she
had
saved
if
you
ever
want
a
sabre
to
deal
some
special
blow
my
life
is
yours
i
am
good
for
that
my
name
is
jean
falcon
otherwise
called
sergeant
of
the
first
company
of
hulot
s
veterans
nicknamed
les
excuse
my
vanity
i
can
only
offer
you
the
soul
of
a
sergeant
but
that
s
at
your
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
whistling
the
lower
one
goes
in
social
life
said
marie
bitterly
the
more
we
find
generous
feelings
without
display
a
marquis
returns
death
for
life
and
a
poor
sergeant
but
enough
of
when
the
weary
woman
was
at
last
in
a
warm
bed
her
faithful
francine
waited
in
vain
for
the
affectionate
to
which
she
was
accustomed
but
her
mistress
seeing
her
still
standing
and
evidently
uneasy
made
her
a
sign
of
distress
this
is
called
a
day
francine
she
said
but
i
have
aged
ten
years
in
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
she
had
risen
corentin
came
to
see
her
and
she
admitted
him
francine
she
exclaimed
my
degradation
is
great
indeed
for
the
thought
of
that
man
is
not
disagreeable
to
still
when
she
saw
him
she
felt
once
more
for
the
hundredth
time
the
instinctive
repulsion
which
two
years
intercourse
had
increased
rather
than
lessened
well
he
said
smiling
i
felt
certain
you
were
succeeding
was
i
mistaken
did
you
get
hold
of
the
wrong
man
corentin
she
replied
with
a
dull
look
of
pain
never
mention
that
affair
to
me
unless
i
speak
of
it
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
casting
oblique
glances
at
her
endeavoring
to
guess
the
secret
thoughts
of
the
singular
woman
whose
mere
glance
had
the
power
of
discomfiting
at
times
the
cleverest
men
i
foresaw
this
check
he
replied
after
a
moment
s
silence
if
you
would
be
willing
to
establish
your
headquarters
in
this
town
i
have
already
found
a
suitable
place
for
you
we
are
in
the
very
centre
of
chouannerie
will
you
stay
here
she
answered
with
an
affirmative
sign
which
enabled
corentin
to
make
conjectures
partly
correct
as
to
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
i
can
hire
a
house
for
you
a
bit
of
national
property
still
unsold
they
are
behind
the
age
in
these
parts
no
one
has
dared
buy
the
old
barrack
because
it
belonged
to
an
who
was
thought
to
be
harsh
it
is
close
to
the
church
of
saint
leonard
and
on
my
word
of
honor
the
view
from
it
is
delightful
something
can
really
be
made
of
the
old
place
will
you
try
it
yes
at
once
she
cried
i
want
a
few
hours
to
have
it
cleaned
and
put
in
order
for
you
so
that
you
may
like
what
matter
she
said
i
could
live
in
a
cloister
or
a
prison
without
caring
however
see
that
everything
is
in
order
before
night
so
that
i
may
sleep
there
in
perfect
solitude
go
leave
me
your
presence
is
intolerable
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
francine
she
is
better
for
me
than
my
own
company
perhaps
adieu
go
go
i
these
words
said
volubly
with
a
mingling
of
coquetry
despotism
and
passion
showed
she
had
entirely
recovered
her
sleep
had
no
doubt
classified
the
impressions
of
the
preceding
day
and
reflection
had
determined
her
on
vengeance
if
a
few
reluctant
signs
appeared
on
her
face
they
only
proved
the
ease
with
which
certain
women
can
bury
the
better
feelings
of
their
souls
and
the
cruel
dissimulation
which
enables
them
to
smile
sweetly
while
planning
the
destruction
of
a
victim
she
sat
alone
after
corentin
had
left
her
thinking
how
she
could
get
the
marquis
still
living
into
her
toils
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
this
woman
had
lived
according
to
her
inmost
desires
but
of
that
life
nothing
remained
but
one
craving
that
of
vengeance
vengeance
complete
and
infinite
it
was
her
one
thought
her
sole
desire
francine
s
words
and
attentions
were
unnoticed
marie
seemed
to
be
sleeping
with
her
eyes
open
and
the
long
day
passed
without
an
action
or
even
a
gesture
that
bore
testimony
to
her
thoughts
she
lay
on
a
couch
which
she
had
made
of
chairs
and
pillows
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
a
few
words
escaped
her
as
if
involuntarily
my
child
she
said
to
francine
i
understood
yesterday
what
it
was
to
live
for
love
i
know
what
it
means
to
die
for
vengeance
yes
i
will
give
my
life
to
seek
him
wherever
he
may
be
to
meet
him
seduce
him
make
him
mine
if
i
do
not
have
that
man
who
dared
to
despise
me
at
my
feet
humble
and
submissive
if
i
do
not
make
him
my
lackey
and
my
slave
i
shall
indeed
be
base
i
shall
not
be
a
woman
i
shall
not
be
the
house
which
corentin
now
hired
for
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
offered
many
gratifications
to
the
innate
love
of
luxury
and
elegance
that
was
part
of
this
girl
the
capricious
creature
took
possession
of
it
with
regal
composure
as
of
a
thing
which
already
belonged
to
her
she
appropriated
the
furniture
and
arranged
it
with
intuitive
sympathy
as
though
she
had
known
it
all
her
life
this
is
a
vulgar
detail
but
one
that
is
not
unimportant
in
sketching
the
character
of
so
exceptional
a
person
she
seemed
to
have
been
already
familiarized
in
a
dream
with
the
house
in
which
she
now
lived
on
her
hatred
as
she
might
have
lived
on
her
love
at
least
she
said
to
herself
i
did
not
rouse
insulting
pity
in
him
i
do
not
owe
him
my
life
oh
my
first
my
last
my
only
love
what
an
end
to
it
she
sprang
upon
francine
who
was
terrified
do
you
love
a
man
oh
yes
yes
i
remember
you
do
i
am
glad
i
have
a
woman
here
who
can
understand
me
ah
my
poor
francette
man
is
a
miserable
being
ha
he
said
he
loved
me
and
his
love
could
not
bear
the
slightest
test
but
i
if
all
men
had
accused
him
i
would
have
defended
him
if
the
universe
rejected
him
my
soul
should
have
been
his
refuge
in
the
old
days
life
was
filled
with
human
beings
coming
and
going
for
whom
i
did
not
care
it
was
sad
and
dull
but
not
horrible
but
now
now
what
is
life
without
him
he
will
live
on
and
i
not
near
him
i
shall
not
see
him
speak
to
him
feel
him
hold
him
press
him
ha
i
would
rather
strangle
him
myself
in
his
sleep
francine
horrified
looked
at
her
in
silence
kill
the
man
you
love
she
said
in
a
soft
voice
yes
yes
if
he
ceases
to
love
but
after
those
ruthless
words
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sat
down
silently
the
next
day
a
man
presented
himself
without
being
announced
his
face
was
stern
it
was
hulot
followed
by
corentin
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
looked
at
the
commandant
and
trembled
you
have
come
she
said
to
ask
me
to
account
for
your
friends
they
are
i
know
it
he
replied
and
not
in
the
service
of
the
for
me
and
by
me
she
said
you
preach
the
nation
to
me
can
the
nation
bring
to
life
those
who
die
for
her
can
she
even
avenge
them
but
i
i
will
avenge
them
she
cried
the
awful
images
of
the
catastrophe
filled
her
imagination
suddenly
and
the
graceful
creature
who
held
modesty
to
be
the
first
of
women
s
wiles
forgot
herself
in
a
moment
of
madness
and
marched
towards
the
amazed
commandant
brusquely
in
exchange
for
a
few
murdered
soldiers
she
said
i
will
bring
to
the
block
a
head
that
is
worth
a
million
heads
of
other
men
it
is
not
a
woman
s
business
to
wage
war
but
you
old
as
you
are
shall
learn
good
stratagems
from
me
i
ll
deliver
a
whole
family
to
your
bayonets
him
his
ancestors
his
past
his
future
i
will
be
as
false
and
treacherous
to
him
as
i
was
good
and
true
yes
commandant
i
will
bring
that
little
noble
to
my
arms
and
he
shall
leave
them
to
go
to
death
i
have
no
other
rival
the
wretch
himself
pronounced
his
doom
day
without
a
your
republic
and
i
shall
be
avenged
the
republic
she
cried
in
a
voice
the
strange
intonations
of
which
horrified
hulot
is
he
to
die
for
bearing
arms
against
the
nation
shall
i
suffer
france
to
rob
me
of
my
vengeance
ah
what
a
little
thing
is
life
death
can
expiate
but
one
crime
he
has
but
one
head
to
fall
but
i
will
make
him
know
in
one
night
that
he
loses
more
than
life
commandant
you
who
will
kill
him
and
she
sighed
see
that
nothing
betrays
my
betrayal
he
must
die
convinced
of
my
fidelity
i
ask
that
of
you
let
him
know
only
me
me
and
my
caresses
she
stopped
but
through
the
crimson
of
her
cheeks
hulot
and
corentin
saw
that
rage
and
delirium
had
not
entirely
smothered
all
sense
of
shame
marie
shuddered
violently
as
she
said
the
words
she
seemed
to
listen
to
them
as
though
she
doubted
whether
she
herself
had
said
them
and
she
made
the
involuntary
movement
of
a
woman
whose
veil
is
falling
from
her
but
you
had
him
in
your
power
said
corentin
very
why
did
you
stop
me
when
i
had
him
asked
hulot
i
did
not
know
what
he
would
prove
to
be
she
cried
then
suddenly
the
excited
woman
who
was
walking
up
and
down
with
hurried
steps
and
casting
savage
glances
at
the
spectators
of
the
storm
calmed
down
i
do
not
know
myself
she
said
in
a
man
s
tone
why
talk
i
must
go
and
find
go
and
find
him
said
hulot
my
dear
woman
take
care
we
are
not
yet
masters
of
this
part
of
the
country
if
you
venture
outside
of
the
town
you
will
be
taken
or
killed
before
you
ve
gone
a
hundred
there
s
never
any
danger
for
those
who
seek
vengeance
she
said
driving
from
her
presence
with
a
disdainful
gesture
the
two
men
whom
she
was
ashamed
to
face
what
a
woman
cried
hulot
as
he
walked
away
with
corentin
a
queer
idea
of
those
police
fellows
in
paris
to
send
her
here
but
she
ll
never
deliver
him
up
to
us
he
added
shaking
his
head
oh
yes
she
will
replied
corentin
don
t
you
see
she
loves
him
said
hulot
that
s
just
why
she
will
besides
looking
at
the
amazed
commandant
i
am
here
to
see
that
she
doesn
t
commit
any
folly
in
my
opinion
comrade
there
is
no
love
in
the
world
worth
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
she
ll
make
out
of
when
the
police
diplomatist
left
the
soldier
the
latter
stood
looking
after
him
and
as
the
sound
of
the
man
s
steps
died
away
he
gave
a
sigh
muttering
to
himself
it
may
be
a
good
thing
after
all
to
be
such
a
dullard
as
i
am
god
s
thunder
if
i
meet
the
gars
i
ll
fight
him
hand
to
hand
or
my
name
s
not
hulot
for
if
that
fox
brings
him
before
me
in
any
of
their
councils
of
war
my
honor
will
be
as
soiled
as
the
shirt
of
a
young
trooper
who
is
under
fire
for
the
first
the
massacre
at
la
vivetiere
and
the
desire
to
avenge
his
friends
had
led
hulot
to
accept
a
reinstatement
in
his
late
command
in
fact
the
new
minister
berthier
had
refused
to
accept
his
resignation
under
existing
circumstances
to
the
official
despatch
was
added
a
private
letter
in
which
without
explaining
the
mission
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
minister
informed
him
that
the
affair
was
entirely
outside
of
the
war
and
not
to
interfere
with
any
military
operations
the
duty
of
the
commanders
he
said
was
limited
to
giving
assistance
to
that
honorable
if
occasion
arose
learning
from
his
scouts
that
the
movements
of
the
chouans
all
tended
towards
a
concentration
of
their
forces
in
the
neighborhood
of
fougeres
hulot
secretly
and
with
forced
marches
brought
two
battalions
of
his
brigade
into
the
town
the
nation
s
danger
his
hatred
of
aristocracy
whose
partisans
threatened
to
convulse
so
large
a
section
of
country
his
desire
to
avenge
his
murdered
friends
revived
in
the
old
veteran
the
fire
of
his
youth
so
this
is
the
life
i
craved
exclaimed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
when
she
was
left
alone
with
francine
no
matter
how
fast
the
hours
go
they
are
to
me
like
centuries
of
suddenly
she
took
francine
s
hand
and
her
voice
soft
as
that
of
the
first
singing
after
a
storm
slowly
gave
sound
to
the
following
words
try
as
i
will
to
forget
them
i
see
those
two
delicious
lips
that
chin
just
raised
those
eyes
of
fire
i
hear
the
hue
of
the
postilion
i
dream
i
dream
why
then
such
hatred
on
awakening
she
drew
a
long
sigh
rose
and
then
for
the
first
time
looked
out
upon
the
country
delivered
over
to
civil
war
by
the
cruel
leader
whom
she
was
plotting
to
destroy
attracted
by
the
scene
she
wandered
out
to
breathe
at
her
ease
beneath
the
sky
and
though
her
steps
conducted
her
at
a
venture
she
was
surely
led
to
the
promenade
of
the
town
by
one
of
those
occult
impulses
of
the
soul
which
lead
us
to
follow
hope
irrationally
thoughts
conceived
under
the
dominion
of
that
spell
are
often
realized
but
we
then
attribute
their
to
a
power
we
call
presentiment
an
inexplicable
power
but
a
real
one
which
our
passions
find
accommodating
like
a
flatterer
who
among
his
many
lies
does
sometimes
tell
the
truth
iii
a
day
without
a
morrow
the
preceding
events
of
this
history
having
been
greatly
influenced
by
the
formation
of
the
regions
in
which
they
happened
it
is
desirable
to
give
a
minute
description
of
them
without
which
the
closing
scenes
might
be
difficult
of
comprehension
the
town
of
fougeres
is
partly
built
upon
a
slate
rock
which
seems
to
have
slipped
from
the
mountains
that
hem
in
the
broad
valley
of
couesnon
to
the
west
and
take
various
names
according
to
their
localities
the
town
is
separated
from
the
mountains
by
a
gorge
through
which
flows
a
small
river
called
the
nancon
to
the
east
the
view
is
the
same
as
from
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
to
the
west
the
town
looks
down
into
the
tortuous
valley
of
the
nancon
but
there
is
a
spot
from
which
a
section
of
the
great
valley
and
the
picturesque
windings
of
the
gorge
can
be
seen
at
the
same
time
this
place
chosen
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
for
their
promenade
and
to
which
the
steps
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
were
now
turned
was
destined
to
be
the
theatre
on
which
the
drama
begun
at
la
vivetiere
was
to
end
therefore
however
picturesque
the
other
parts
of
fougeres
may
be
attention
must
be
particularly
given
to
the
scenery
which
meets
the
eye
from
this
terrace
to
give
an
idea
of
the
rock
on
which
fougeres
stands
as
seen
on
this
side
we
may
compare
it
to
one
of
those
immense
towers
circled
by
saracen
architects
with
balconies
on
each
story
which
were
reached
by
spiral
stairways
to
add
to
this
effect
the
rock
is
capped
by
a
gothic
church
the
small
spires
and
buttresses
of
which
make
its
shape
almost
precisely
that
of
a
before
the
portal
of
this
church
which
is
dedicated
to
is
a
small
irregular
square
where
the
soil
is
held
up
by
a
buttressed
wall
which
forms
a
balustrade
and
communicates
by
a
flight
of
steps
with
the
promenade
this
public
walk
like
a
second
cornice
extends
round
the
rock
a
few
rods
below
the
square
of
it
is
a
broad
piece
of
ground
planted
with
trees
and
it
joins
the
fortifications
of
the
town
about
ten
rods
below
the
walls
and
rocks
which
support
this
promenade
due
to
a
happy
combination
of
indestructible
slate
and
patient
industry
another
circular
road
exists
called
the
queen
s
staircase
this
is
cut
in
the
rock
itself
and
leads
to
a
bridge
built
across
the
nancon
by
anne
of
brittany
below
this
road
which
forms
a
third
cornice
gardens
descend
terrace
after
terrace
to
the
river
like
shelves
covered
with
flowers
parallel
with
the
promenade
on
the
other
side
of
the
nancon
and
across
its
narrow
valley
high
called
the
heights
of
follow
the
stream
and
descend
in
gentle
slopes
to
the
great
valley
where
they
turn
abruptly
to
the
north
towards
the
south
where
the
town
itself
really
ends
and
the
faubourg
begins
the
fougeres
rock
makes
a
bend
becomes
less
steep
and
turns
into
the
great
valley
following
the
course
of
the
river
which
it
hems
in
between
itself
and
the
heights
of
forming
a
sort
of
pass
through
which
the
water
escapes
in
two
streamlets
to
the
couesnon
into
which
they
fall
this
pretty
group
of
rocky
hills
is
called
the
the
little
vale
they
surround
is
the
val
de
gibarry
the
rich
pastures
of
which
supply
the
butter
known
to
epicures
as

to
this
square
erection
against
the
side
of
which
the
house
now
occupied
by
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
rested
is
a
wall
partly
built
by
hands
and
partly
formed
of

it
offered
a
smooth
surface

stands
a
gateway

ancient
castle

enormous
erections

with
lofty
walls
fifteen
feet
thick
protected
on
the
east
by
a
pond
from
which
flows
the

the
waters
of

its
moats
and
on
the
west
by
the
inaccessible
granite
rock
on
which
it
stands

from

promenade
this
magnificent
relic
of
the
middle
ages
wrapped

huge
horseshoe
lined
with
precipices
on
which
the

have
in

of
ages
cut
various
narrow
footways

its

bottom
of
this
vast
funnel
the
little
river

through
meadows
that
are
always
cool
and
green
lying
softly
like
a

beneath

among
the

boulders
is
a
church
dedicated
to
whose
name
is
given
to
the
suburb
which
lies
across
the
nancon
this
suburb
flung
as
it
were
to
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
and
its
church
the
spire
of
which
does
not
rise
to
the
height
of
the

which
threaten
to
crush
it
are
picturesquely
watered
by
several
affluents
of

by

by

the
whole

surrounded
by
the
heights
of
rille
which
form
part
of
a
general
range
of
mountains
enclosing
the
broad
valley
of
couesnon
such
are
the
chief
features
of
this
landscape
the
principal
characteristic
of
which
is
a
rugged
wildness
softened
by
smiling
accidents
by
a
happy
blending
of
the
finest
works
of
men
s
hands
with
the
capricious
lay
of
a
land
full
of
unexpected
contrasts
by
a
something
hardly
to
be
explained
which
surprises
astonishes
and
puzzles
in
no
other
part
of
france
can
the
traveller
meet
with
such
grandiose
contrasts
as
those
offered
by
the
great
basin
of
the
couesnon
and
the
valleys
hidden
among
the
rocks
of
fougeres
and
the
heights
of
rille
their
beauty
is
of
that
unspeakable
kind
in
which
chance
triumphs
and
all
the
harmonies
of
nature
do
their
part
the
clear
limpid
flowing
waters
the
mountains
clothed
with
the
vigorous
vegetation
of
those
regions
the
sombre
rocks
the
graceful
buildings
the
fortifications
raised
by
nature
and
the
granite
towers
built
by
man
combined
with
all
the
artifices
of
light
and
shade
with
the
contrasts
of
the
varieties
of
foliage
with
the
groups
of
houses
where
an
active
population
swarms
with
the
lonely
barren
places
where
the
granite
will
not
suffer
even
the
lichen
to
fasten
on
its
surface
in
short
with
all
the
ideas
we
ask
a
landscape
to
possess
grace
and
awfulness
poesy
with
its
renascent
magic
sublime
pictures
delightful
ruralities
all
these
are
here
it
is
brittany
in
bloom
the
tower
called
the
papegaut
against
which
the
house
now
occupied
by
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
rested
has
its
base
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
precipice
and
rises
to
the
esplanade
which
forms
the
cornice
or
terrace
before
the
church
of
from
marie
s
house
which
was
open
on
three
sides
could
be
seen
the
horseshoe
which
begins
at
the
tower
itself
the
winding
valley
of
the
nancon
and
the
square
of
it
is
one
of
a
group
of
wooden
buildings
standing
parallel
with
the
western
side
of
the
church
with
which
they
form
an
the
farther
end
of
which
opens
on
a
steep
street
skirting
the
church
and
leading
to
the
gate
of
along
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
now
made
her
way
marie
naturally
avoided
entering
the
square
of
the
church
which
was
then
above
her
and
turned
towards
the
promenade
the
magnificence
of
the
scene
which
met
her
eyes
silenced
for
a
moment
the
tumult
of
her
passions
she
admired
the
vast
trend
of
the
valley
which
her
eyes
took
in
from
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
to
the
plateau
where
the
main
road
to
vitry
passes
then
her
eyes
rested
on
the
and
the
winding
gorges
of
the
val
de
gibarry
the
crests
of
which
were
bathed
in
the
misty
glow
of
the
setting
sun
she
was
almost
frightened
by
the
depth
of
the
valley
of
the
nancon
the
tallest
poplars
of
which
scarcely
reached
to
the
level
of
the
gardens
below
the
queen
s
staircase
at
this
time
of
day
the
smoke
from
the
houses
in
the
suburbs
and
in
the
valleys
made
a
vapor
in
the
air
through
which
the
various
objects
had
a
bluish
tinge
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
day
were
beginning
to
fade
the
firmament
took
a
pearly
tone
the
moon
was
casting
its
veil
of
light
into
the
ravine
all
things
tended
to
plunge
the
soul
into
reverie
and
bring
back
the
memory
of
those
beloved
in
a
moment
the
scene
before
her
was
powerless
to
hold
marie
s
thoughts
in
vain
did
the
setting
sun
cast
its
and
its
crimson
sheets
to
the
depths
of
the
river
and
along
the
meadows
and
over
the
graceful
buildings
strewn
among
the
rocks
she
stood
immovable
gazing
at
the
heights
of
the
mont
the
frantic
hope
which
had
led
her
to
the
promenade
was
miraculously
realized
among
the
gorse
and
bracken
which
grew
upon
those
heights
she
was
certain
that
she
recognized
in
spite
of
the
goatskins
which
they
wore
a
number
of
the
guests
at
la
vivetiere
and
among
them
the
gars
whose
every
moment
became
vivid
to
her
eyes
in
the
softened
light
of
the
sinking
sun
a
few
steps
back
of
the
ground
of
men
she
distinguished
her
enemy
madame
du
gua
for
a
moment
marie
fancied
that
she
dreamed
but
her
rival
s
hatred
soon
proved
to
her
that
the
dream
was
a
living
one
the
attention
she
was
giving
to
the
least
little
gesture
of
the
marquis
prevented
her
from
observing
the
care
with
which
madame
du
gua
aimed
a
musket
at
her
but
a
shot
which
woke
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
and
a
ball
that
whistled
past
her
warned
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
of
her
rival
s
determination
she
sends
me
her
card
thought
marie
smiling
instantly
a
qui
vive
echoing
from
sentry
to
sentry
from
the
castle
to
the
porte
proved
to
the
chouans
the
alertness
of
the
blues
inasmuch
as
the
least
accessible
of
their
ramparts
was
so
well
guarded
it
is
she
and
he
muttered
marie
to
herself
to
seek
the
marquis
follow
his
steps
and
overtake
him
was
a
thought
that
flashed
like
lightning
through
her
mind
i
have
no
weapon
she
cried
she
remembered
that
on
leaving
paris
she
had
flung
into
a
trunk
an
elegant
dagger
formerly
belonging
to
a
sultana
which
she
had
jestingly
brought
with
her
to
the
theatre
of
war
as
some
persons
take
in
which
to
jot
down
their
travelling
ideas
she
was
less
attracted
by
the
prospect
of
shedding
blood
than
by
the
pleasure
of
wearing
a
pretty
weapon
studded
with
precious
stones
and
playing
with
a
blade
that
was
stainless
three
days
earlier
she
had
deeply
regretted
having
put
this
dagger
in
a
trunk
when
to
escape
her
enemies
at
la
vivetiere
she
had
thought
for
a
moment
of
killing
herself
she
now
returned
to
the
house
found
the
weapon
put
it
in
her
belt
wrapped
a
large
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
a
black
lace
scarf
about
her
hair
and
covered
her
head
with
one
of
those
hats
distinctive
of
chouans
which
belonged
to
a
servant
of
the
house
then
with
the
presence
of
mind
which
excited
passions
often
give
she
took
the
glove
which
had
given
her
as
a
safeguard
and
saying
in
reply
to
francine
s
terrible
looks
i
would
seek
him
in
hell
she
returned
to
the
promenade
the
gars
was
still
at
the
same
place
but
alone
by
the
direction
of
his
telescope
he
seemed
to
be
examining
with
the
careful
attention
of
a
commander
the
various
paths
across
the
nancon
the
queen
s
staircase
and
the
road
leading
through
the
porte
and
round
the
church
of
that
name
where
it
meets
the
under
range
of
the
guns
at
the
castle
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
took
one
of
the
little
paths
made
by
goats
and
their
keepers
leading
down
from
the
promenade
reached
the
staircase
then
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
crossed
the
nancon
and
the
suburb
and
divining
like
a
bird
in
the
desert
her
right
course
among
the
dangerous
precipices
of
the
mont
she
followed
a
slippery
track
defined
upon
the
granite
and
in
spite
of
the
prickly
gorse
and
reeds
and
loose
stones
which
hindered
her
she
climbed
the
steep
ascent
with
an
energy
greater
perhaps
than
that
of
a
man
the
energy
momentarily
possessed
by
a
woman
under
the
influence
of
passion
night
overtook
her
as
she
endeavored
by
the
failing
moonlight
to
make
out
the
path
the
marquis
must
have
taken
an
obstinate
quest
without
reward
for
the
dead
silence
about
her
was
sufficient
proof
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
chouans
and
their
leader
this
effort
of
passion
collapsed
with
the
hope
that
inspired
it
finding
herself
alone
after
nightfall
in
a
hostile
country
she
began
to
reflect
and
hulot
s
advice
together
with
the
recollection
of
madame
du
gua
s
attempt
made
her
tremble
with
fear
the
stillness
of
the
night
so
deep
in
mountain
regions
enabled
her
to
hear
the
fall
of
every
leaf
even
at
a
distance
and
these
slight
sounds
vibrated
on
the
air
as
though
to
give
a
measure
of
the
silence
or
the
solitude
the
wind
was
blowing
across
the
heights
and
sweeping
away
the
clouds
with
violence
producing
an
alternation
of
shadows
and
light
the
effect
of
which
increased
her
fears
and
gave
fantastic
and
terrifying
semblances
to
the
most
harmless
objects
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
houses
of
fougeres
where
the
domestic
lights
were
burning
like
so
many
earthly
stars
and
she
presently
saw
distinctly
the
tower
of
papegaut
she
was
but
a
very
short
distance
from
her
own
house
but
within
that
space
was
the
ravine
she
remembered
the
declivities
by
which
she
had
come
and
wondered
if
there
were
not
more
risk
in
attempting
to
return
to
fougeres
than
in
following
out
the
purpose
which
had
brought
her
she
reflected
that
the
marquis
s
glove
would
surely
protect
her
from
the
chouans
and
that
madame
du
gua
was
the
only
enemy
to
be
really
feared
with
this
idea
in
her
mind
marie
clasped
her
dagger
and
tried
to
find
the
way
to
a
country
house
the
roofs
of
which
she
had
noticed
as
she
climbed
but
she
walked
slowly
for
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
majestic
solemnity
which
oppresses
a
solitary
being
in
the
night
time
in
the
midst
of
wild
scenery
where
lofty
mountains
nod
their
heads
like
assembled
giants
the
rustle
of
her
gown
caught
by
the
brambles
made
her
tremble
more
than
once
and
more
than
once
she
hastened
her
steps
only
to
slacken
them
again
as
she
thought
her
last
hour
had
come
before
long
matters
assumed
an
aspect
which
the
boldest
men
could
not
have
faced
without
alarm
and
which
threw
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
into
the
sort
of
terror
that
so
affects
the
very
springs
of
life
that
all
things
become
excessive
weakness
as
well
as
strength
the
feeblest
beings
will
then
do
deeds
of
amazing
power
the
strongest
go
mad
with
fear
marie
heard
at
a
short
distance
a
number
of
strange
sounds
distinct
yet
vague
indicative
of
confusion
and
tumult
fatiguing
to
the
ear
which
tried
to
distinguish
them
they
came
from
the
ground
which
seemed
to
tremble
beneath
the
feet
of
a
multitude
of
marching
men
a
momentary
clearness
in
the
sky
enabled
her
to
perceive
at
a
little
distance
long
files
of
hideous
figures
waving
like
ears
of
corn
and
gliding
like
phantoms
but
she
scarcely
saw
them
for
darkness
fell
again
like
a
black
curtain
and
hid
the
fearful
scene
which
seemed
to
her
full
of
yellow
dazzling
eyes
she
turned
hastily
and
ran
to
the
top
of
a
bank
to
escape
meeting
three
of
these
horrible
figures
who
were
coming
towards
her
did
you
see
it
said
one
i
felt
a
cold
wind
as
it
rushed
past
me
replied
a
hoarse
voice
i
smelt
a
damp
and
graveyard
smell
said
the
third
was
it
white
asked
the
first
why
should
only
come
back
out
of
all
those
we
left
dead
at
la
pelerine
said
the
second
why
indeed
replied
the
third
why
do
the
men
have
the
preference
well
at
any
rate
i
d
rather
die
without
confession
than
wander
about
as
he
does
without
eating
or
drinking
and
no
blood
in
his
body
or
flesh
on
his
ah
this
exclamation
or
rather
this
fearful
cry
issued
from
the
group
as
the
three
chouans
pointed
to
the
slender
form
and
pallid
face
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
fled
away
with
terrified
rapidity
without
a
sound
here
he
is
there
he
is
where
there
he
s
gone
no
yes
can
you
see
him
these
cries
reverberated
like
the
monotonous
murmur
of
waves
upon
a
shore
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
walked
bravely
in
the
direction
of
the
house
she
had
seen
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
a
number
of
persons
who
all
fled
away
at
her
approach
with
every
sign
of
panic
fear
she
felt
impelled
to
advance
by
a
mysterious
power
which
coerced
her
the
lightness
of
her
body
which
seemed
to
herself
inexplicable
was
another
source
of
terror
these
forms
which
rose
in
masses
at
her
approach
as
if
from
the
ground
on
which
she
trod
uttered
moans
which
were
scarcely
human
at
last
she
reached
not
without
difficulty
a
trampled
garden
the
hedges
and
fences
of
which
were
broken
down
stopped
by
a
sentry
she
showed
the
glove
the
moon
lighted
her
face
and
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
already
pointed
at
her
was
dropped
by
the
chouan
who
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
which
echoed
through
the
place
she
now
saw
large
buildings
where
a
few
lighted
windows
showed
the
rooms
that
were
occupied
and
presently
reached
the
walls
without
further
hindrance
through
the
window
into
which
she
looked
she
saw
madame
du
gua
and
the
leaders
who
were
convoked
at
la
vivetiere
bewildered
at
the
sight
also
by
the
conviction
of
her
danger
she
turned
hastily
to
a
little
opening
protected
by
iron
bars
and
saw
in
a
long
vaulted
hall
the
marquis
alone
and
gloomy
within
six
feet
of
her
the
reflection
of
the
fire
before
which
he
was
sitting
in
a
clumsy
chair
lighted
his
face
with
a
vacillating
ruddy
glow
that
gave
the
character
of
a
vision
to
the
scene
motionless
and
trembling
the
girl
stood
clinging
to
the
bars
to
catch
his
words
if
he
spoke
seeing
him
so
depressed
disheartened
and
pale
she
believed
herself
to
be
the
cause
of
his
sadness
her
anger
changed
to
pity
her
pity
to
tenderness
and
she
suddenly
knew
that
it
was
not
revenge
alone
which
had
brought
her
there
the
marquis
rose
turned
his
head
and
stood
amazed
when
he
saw
as
if
in
a
cloud
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
face
then
he
shook
his
head
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
contempt
exclaiming
must
i
forever
see
the
face
of
that
devil
even
when
awake
this
utter
contempt
for
her
forced
a
laugh
from
the
unhappy
girl
which
made
the
young
leader
quiver
he
sprang
to
the
window
but
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
gone
she
heard
the
steps
of
a
man
behind
her
which
she
supposed
to
be
those
of
the
marquis
and
to
escape
him
she
knew
no
obstacles
she
would
have
scaled
walls
and
flown
through
air
she
would
have
found
and
followed
a
path
to
hell
sooner
than
have
seen
again
in
flaming
letters
on
the
forehead
of
that
man
i
despise
you
words
which
an
inward
voice
sounded
in
her
soul
with
the
noise
of
a
trumpet
after
walking
a
short
distance
without
knowing
where
she
went
she
stopped
conscious
of
a
damp
exhalation
alarmed
by
the
sound
of
voices
she
went
down
some
steps
which
led
into
a
cellar
as
she
reached
the
last
of
them
she
stopped
to
listen
and
discover
the
direction
her
pursuers
might
take
above
the
sounds
from
the
outside
which
were
somewhat
loud
she
could
hear
within
the
lugubrious
moans
of
a
human
being
which
added
to
her
terror
rays
of
light
coming
down
the
steps
made
her
fear
that
this
retreat
was
only
too
well
known
to
her
enemies
and
to
escape
them
she
summoned
fresh
energy
some
moments
later
after
recovering
her
composure
of
mind
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
conceive
by
what
means
she
had
been
able
to
climb
a
little
wall
in
a
recess
of
which
she
was
now
hidden
she
took
no
notice
at
first
of
the
cramped
position
in
which
she
was
but
before
long
the
pain
of
it
became
intolerable
for
she
was
bending
double
under
the
arched
opening
of
a
vault
like
the
crouching
venus
which
ignorant
persons
attempt
to
squeeze
into
too
narrow
a
niche
the
wall
which
was
rather
thick
and
built
of
granite
formed
a
low
partition
between
the
stairway
and
the
cellar
whence
the
groans
were
issuing
presently
she
saw
an
individual
clothed
in
a
goatskin
enter
the
cave
beneath
her
and
move
about
without
making
any
sign
of
eager
search
impatient
to
discover
if
she
had
any
chance
of
safety
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
waited
with
anxiety
till
the
light
brought
by
the
lighted
the
whole
cave
where
she
could
partly
distinguish
a
formless
but
living
mass
which
was
trying
to
reach
a
part
of
the
wall
with
violent
and
repeated
jerks
something
like
those
of
a
carp
lying
out
of
water
on
a
shore
a
small
pine
torch
threw
its
blue
and
hazy
light
into
the
cave
in
spite
of
the
gloomy
poetic
effects
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
imagination
cast
about
this
vaulted
chamber
which
was
echoing
to
the
sounds
of
a
pitiful
prayer
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
place
was
nothing
more
than
an
underground
kitchen
evidently
long
abandoned
when
the
formless
mass
was
distinguishable
it
proved
to
be
a
short
and
very
fat
man
whose
limbs
were
carefully
bound
before
he
had
been
left
lying
on
the
damp
stone
floor
of
the
kitchen
by
those
who
had
seized
him
when
he
saw
the
approach
him
with
a
torch
in
one
hand
and
a
fagot
of
sticks
in
the
other
the
captive
gave
a
dreadful
groan
which
so
wrought
upon
the
sensibilities
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
that
she
forgot
her
own
terror
and
despair
and
the
cramped
position
of
her
limbs
which
were
growing
numb
but
she
made
a
great
effort
and
remained
still
the
chouan
flung
the
sticks
into
the
fireplace
after
trying
the
strength
of
an
old
crane
which
was
fastened
to
a
long
iron
bar
then
he
set
fire
to
the
wood
with
his
torch
marie
saw
with
terror
that
the
man
was
the
same
to
whom
her
rival
had
delivered
her
and
whose
figure
illuminated
by
the
flame
was
like
that
of
the
little
boxwood
men
so
grotesquely
carved
in
germany
the
moans
of
his
prisoner
produced
a
broad
grin
upon
features
that
were
ribbed
with
wrinkles
and
tanned
by
the
sun
you
see
he
said
to
his
victim
that
we
christians
keep
our
promises
which
you
don
t
that
fire
is
going
to
thaw
out
your
legs
and
tongue
and
hands
hey
hey
i
don
t
see
a
to
put
under
your
feet
they
are
so
fat
the
grease
may
put
out
the
fire
your
house
must
be
badly
furnished
if
it
can
t
give
its
master
all
he
wants
to
warm
the
victim
uttered
a
sharp
cry
as
if
he
hoped
someone
would
hear
him
through
the
ceiling
and
come
to
his
assistance
ho
sing
away
monsieur
d
orgemont
they
are
all
asleep
upstairs
and
is
just
behind
me
he
ll
shut
the
cellar
while
speaking
was
sounding
with
the
of
his
musket
the
of
the
chimney
the
tiles
of
the
floor
the
walls
and
the
ovens
to
discover
if
possible
where
the
miser
hid
his
gold
this
search
was
made
with
such
adroitness
that
d
orgemont
kept
silence
as
if
he
feared
to
have
been
betrayed
by
some
frightened
servant
for
though
he
trusted
his
secrets
to
no
one
his
habits
gave
plenty
of
ground
for
logical
deductions
turned
several
times
sharply
to
look
at
his
victim
as
children
do
when
they
try
to
guess
by
the
conscious
expression
of
the
comrade
who
has
hidden
an
article
whether
they
are
nearer
to
or
farther
away
from
it
d
orgemont
pretended
to
be
alarmed
when
the
chouan
tapped
the
ovens
which
sounded
hollow
and
seemed
to
wish
to
play
upon
his
eager
credulity
just
then
three
other
chouans
rushed
down
the
steps
and
entered
the
kitchen
seeing
among
them
discontinued
his
search
after
casting
upon
d
orgemont
a
look
that
conveyed
the
wrath
of
his
balked
covetousness
marie
lambrequin
has
come
to
life
cried
proclaiming
by
his
manner
that
all
other
interests
were
of
no
account
beside
this
great
piece
of
news
i
m
not
surprised
said
he
took
the
sacrament
so
often
the
good
god
belonged
to
ha
ha
observed
that
didn
t
stand
him
in
anything
at
his
death
he
hadn
t
received
absolution
before
the
affair
at
la
pelerine
he
had
cheapened
goguelu
s
daughter
and
was
living
in
mortal
sin
the
abbe
gudin
said
he
d
have
to
roam
round
two
months
as
a
ghost
before
he
could
come
to
life
we
saw
him
pass
us
he
was
pale
he
was
cold
he
was
thin
he
smelt
of
the
and
his
reverence
says
that
if
a
ghost
gets
hold
of
a
living
man
he
can
force
him
to
be
his
companion
said
the
fourth
chouan
the
grotesque
appearance
of
this
last
speaker
drew
from
the
pious
reflections
he
had
been
making
on
the
accomplishment
of
this
miracle
of
coming
to
life
which
according
to
the
abbe
gudin
would
happen
to
every
true
defender
of
religion
and
the
king
you
see
he
said
to
the
fourth
man
gravely
what
comes
of
omitting
even
the
smallest
duty
commanded
by
our
holy
religion
it
is
a
warning
to
us
given
by
saint
anne
of
auray
to
be
rigorous
with
ourselves
for
the
slightest
sin
your

asked

voice
which
made

added
turning

with

in

curt
tone
don

happen
in

or
i
ll
cut

in

like
a

as
to
the
emissaries
of

but
since
that
affair
at
la
vivetiere
the
grande
garce
has
added
a
green
ribbon
to
pille
miche
nudged
his
comrade
by
the
elbow
and
showed
him
d
orgemont
who
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
but
and
both
knew
by
experience
that
no
one
ever
slept
by
the
corner
of
their
fire
and
though
the
last
words
said
to
were
almost
whispered
they
must
have
been
heard
by
the
victim
and
the
four
chouans
looked
at
him
fixedly
thinking
perhaps
that
fear
had
deprived
him
of
his
senses
suddenly
at
a
slight
sign
from
pulled
off
d
orgemont
s
shoes
and
stockings
and
seized
him
round
the
body
and
carried
him
to
the
fire
then
took
one
of
the
thongs
that
tied
the
fagots
and
fastened
the
miser
s
feet
to
the
crane
these
actions
and
the
horrible
celerity
with
which
they
were
done
brought
cries
from
the
victim
which
became
when
gathered
the
burning
sticks
under
his
legs
my
friends
my
good
friends
screamed
d
orgemont
you
hurt
me
you
kill
me
i
m
a
christian
like
you
lie
in
your
throat
replied
your
brother
denied

and
as
for
you
you
bought
the
abbey
of
juvigny
the
abbe
gudin
says
we
can
roast
apostates
when
we

but
my
brothers
in

i
don

gave
you
two
weeks
and
it
is
now
two
months
and
here
hasn
t
received
the
haven
t
you
received
any
of
it
asked
the
miser
in
despair
none
of
it
monsieur
d
orgemont
replied
frightened
the
cries
which
had
sunk
into
groans
continuous
as
the
rattle
in
a
dying
throat
now
began
again
with
dreadful
violence
accustomed
to
such
scenes
the
four
chouans
looked
at
d
orgemont
who
was
twisting
and
howling
so
coolly
that
they
seemed
like
travellers
watching
before
an
inn
fire
till
the
roast
meat
was
done
enough
to
eat
i
m
dying
i
m
dying
cried
the
victim
and
you
won
t
get
my
in
spite
of
these
agonizing
cries
saw
that
the
fire
did
not
yet
scorch
the
skin
he
drew
the
sticks
cleverly
together
so
as
to
make
a
slight
flame
on
this
d
orgemont
called
out
in
a
quavering
voice
my
friends
unbind
me
how
much
do
you
want
a
hundred
crowns
a
thousand
crowns
ten
thousand
crowns
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
i
offer
you
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
the
voice
became
so
lamentable
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
forgot
her
own
danger
and
uttered
an
exclamation
who
spoke
asked
the
chouans
looked
about
them
with
terrified
eyes
these
men
so
brave
in
fight
were
unable
to
face
a
ghost
alone
continued
to
listen
to
the
promises
which
the
flames
were
now
extracting
from
his
victim
five
hundred
thousand
crowns
yes
i
ll
give
them
cried
the
victim
well
where
are
they
answered
tranquilly
under
the
first
holy
virgin
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
to
the
left
you
are
brigands
thieves
ah
i
m
dying
there
s
ten
thousand
francs
francs
we
don
t
want

said
those
republican
coins

pagan
figures
which

are
not

they
are
good
louis
d
or
but
oh
undo
me
unbind
me
i
ve
told
you
where
my
life
is
my
the
four
chouans
looked
at
each
other
as
if
thinking
which
of
their
number
they
could
trust
sufficiently
to
disinter
the
money
the
cannibal
cruelty
of
the
scene
so
horrified
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
that
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
though
doubtful
whether
the
role
of
ghost
which
her
pale
face
and
the
chouan
superstitions
evidently
assigned
to
her
would
carry
her
safely
through
the
danger
she
called
out
courageously
do
you
not
fear
god
s
anger
unbind
him
brutes
the
chouans
raised
their
heads
and
saw
in
the
air
above
them
two
eyes
which
shone
like
stars
and
they
fled
terrified
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
sprang
into
the
kitchen
ran
to
d
orgemont
and
pulled
him
so
violently
from
the
crane
that
the
thong
broke
then
with
the
blade
of
her
dagger
she
cut
the
cords
which
bound
him
when
the
miser
was
free
and
on
his
feet
the
first
expression
of
his
face
was
a
painful
but
sardonic
grin
yes
go
to
the
you
brigands
he
said
ho
ho
this
is
the
second
time
i
ve
fooled
them
they
won
t
get
a
third
chance
at
so
saying
he
caught
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
hand
drew
her
under
the
to
the
back
of
the
hearth
in
a
way
to
avoid
disturbing
the
fire
which
covered
only
a
small
part
of
it
then
he
touched
a
spring
the
iron
back
was
lifted
and
when
their
enemies
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
heavy
door
of
the
had
already
fallen
noiselessly
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
then
understood
the
movements
she
had
seen
the
miser
making
the
ghost
has
taken
the
blue
with
him
cried
the
voice
of
the
fright
of
the
chouans
must
have
been
great
for
the
words
were
followed
by
a
stillness
so
profound
that
d
orgemont
and
his
companion
could
hear
them
muttering
to
themselves
ave
sancta
anna
auriaca
gratia
plena
dominus
tecum
etc
they
are
praying
the
fools
cried
d
orgemont
hush
are
you
not
afraid
they
will
discover
us
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
checking
her
companion
the
old
man
s
laugh
dissipated
her
fears
that
iron
back
is
set
in
a
wall
of
granite
two
feet
thick
he
said
we
can
hear
them
but
they
can
t
hear
then
he
took
the
hand
of
his
preserver
and
placed
it
near
a
crevice
through
which
a
current
of
fresh
air
was
blowing
she
then
perceived
that
the
opening
was
made
in
the
shaft
of
the
chimney
ai
ai
cried
d
orgemont
the
devil
how
my
legs
smart
the
chouans
having
finished
their
prayer
departed
and
the
old
miser
again
caught
the
hand
of
his
companion
and
helped
her
to
climb
some
narrow
winding
steps
cut
in
the
granite
wall
when
they
had
mounted
some
twenty
of
these
steps
the
gleam
of
a
lamp
dimly
lighted
their
heads
the
miser
stopped
turned
to
his
companion
examined
her
face
as
if
it
were
a
bank
note
he
was
doubtful
about
cashing
and
heaved
a
heavy
sigh
by
bringing
you
here
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
i
have
paid
you
in
full
for
the
service
you
did
me
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
give
you
monsieur
i
ask
nothing
of
you
she
said
these
words
and
also
perhaps
the
disdainful
expression
on
the
beautiful
face
reassured
the
old
man
for
he
answered
not
without
a
sigh
ah
if
you
take
it
that
way
i
have
gone
too
far
not
to
continue
he
politely
assisted
marie
to
climb
a
few
more
steps
rather
strangely
constructed
and
half
willingly
half
reluctantly
ushered
her
into
a
small
closet
about
four
feet
square
lighted
by
a
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
miser
had
made
preparations
to
spend
more
than
one
day
in
this
retreat
if
the
events
of
the
civil
war
compelled
him
to
hide
himself
don
t
brush
against
that
wall
you
might
whiten
yourself
said
d
orgemont
suddenly
as
he
hurriedly
put
his
hand
between
the
girl
s
shawl
and
the
stones
which
seemed
to
have
been
lately
whitewashed
the
old
man
s
action
produced
quite
another
effect
from
that
he
intended
marie
looked
about
her
and
saw
in
one
corner
a
sort
of
projection
the
shape
of
which
forced
from
her
a
cry
of
terror
for
she
fancied
it
was
that
of
a
human
being
standing
erect
and
mortared
into
the
wall
d
orgemont
made
a
violent
sign
to
her
to
hold
her
tongue
and
his
little
eyes
of
a
porcelain
blue
showed
as
much
fear
as
those
of
his
companion
fool
do
you
think
i
murdered
him
it
is
the
body
of
my
brother
and
the
old
man
gave
a
lugubrious
sigh
he
was
the
first
priest
and
this
was
the
only
asylum
where
he
was
safe
against
the
fury
of
the
chouans
and
the
other
priests
he
was
my
elder
brother
and
he
alone
had
the
patience
to
each
me
the
decimal
calculus
oh
he
was
a
good
priest
he
was
economical
and
laid
by
money
it
is
four
years
since
he
died
i
don
t
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
perhaps
it
was
that
priests
are
so
in
the
habit
of
kneeling
down
to
pray
that
he
couldn
t
get
accustomed
to
standing
upright
here
as
i
do
i
walled
him
up
there
have
dug
him
up
elsewhere
some
day
perhaps
i
can
put
him
in
holy
ground
as
he
used
to
call
it
poor
man
he
only
took
the
oath
out
of
a
tear
rolled
from
the
hard
eyes
of
the
little
old
man
whose
rusty
wig
suddenly
seemed
less
hideous
to
the
girl
and
she
turned
her
eyes
respectfully
away
from
his
distress
but
in
spite
of
these
tender
reminiscences
d
orgemont
kept
on
saying
don
t
go
near
the
wall
you
might
his
eyes
never
ceased
to
watch
hers
hoping
thus
to
prevent
her
from
examining
too
closely
the
walls
of
the
closet
where
the
close
air
was
scarcely
enough
to
inflate
the
lungs
marie
succeeded
however
in
getting
a
sufficiently
good
look
in
spite
of
her
argus
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
strange
protuberances
in
the
walls
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
sacks
of
coin
which
the
miser
had
placed
there
and
plastered
up
old
d
orgemont
was
now
in
a
state
of
almost
grotesque
bewilderment
the
pain
in
his
legs
the
terror
he
felt
at
seeing
a
human
being
in
the
midst
of
his
hoards
could
be
read
in
every
wrinkle
of
his
face
and
yet
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
expressed
with
unaccustomed
fire
a
lively
emotion
excited
in
him
by
the
presence
of
his
liberator
whose
white
and
rosy
cheek
invited
kisses
and
whose
velvety
black
eye
sent
waves
of
blood
to
his
heart
so
hot
that
he
was
much
in
doubt
whether
they
were
signs
of
life
or
of
death
are
you
married
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
no
she
said
smiling
i
have
a
little
something
he
continued
heaving
a
sigh
though
i
am
not
so
rich
as
people
think
for
a
young
girl
like
you
must
love
diamonds
trinkets
carriages
money
i
ve
got
all
that
to
give
after
my
death
hey
if
you
will
the
old
man
s
eyes
were
so
shrewd
and
betrayed
such
calculation
in
this
ephemeral
love
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
as
she
shook
her
head
in
sign
of
refusal
felt
that
his
desire
to
marry
her
was
solely
to
bury
his
secret
in
another
himself
money
she
said
with
a
look
of
scorn
which
made
him
satisfied
and
angry
both
money
is
nothing
to
me
you
would
be
three
times
as
rich
as
you
are
if
you
had
all
the
gold
that
i
have
refused
she
stopped
suddenly
don
t
go
near
that
wall
or
but
i
hear
a
voice
she
said
it
echoes
through
that
wall
a
voice
that
is
more
to
me
than
all
your
before
the
miser
could
stop
her
marie
had
laid
her
hand
on
a
small
colored
engraving
of
louis
xv
on
horseback
to
her
amazement
it
turned
and
she
saw
in
a
room
beneath
her
the
marquis
de
montauran
who
was
loading
a
musket
the
opening
hidden
by
a
little
panel
on
which
the
picture
was
gummed
seemed
to
form
some
opening
in
the
ceiling
of
the
adjoining
chamber
which
no
doubt
was
the
bedroom
of
the
royalist
general
d
orgemont
closed
the
opening
with
much
precaution
and
looked
at
the
girl
sternly
don
t
say
a
word
if
you
love
your
life
you
haven
t
thrown
your
on
a
worthless
building
do
you
know
that
the
marquis
de
montauran
is
worth
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
from
lands
which
have
not
yet
been
confiscated
and
i
read
in
the
primidi
de
l
a
decree
of
the
consuls
putting
an
end
to
confiscation
ha
ha
you
ll
think
the
gars
a
prettier
fellow
than
ever
won
t
you
your
eyes
are
shining
like
two
new
louis
d
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
face
was
indeed
keenly
excited
when
she
heard
that
voice
so
near
her
since
she
had
been
standing
there
erect
in
the
midst
as
it
were
of
a
silver
mine
the
spring
of
her
mind
held
down
by
these
strange
events
recovered
itself
she
seemed
to
have
formed
some
sinister
resolution
and
to
perceive
a
means
of
carrying
it
out
there
is
no
return
from
such
contempt
she
was
saying
to
herself
and
if
he
can
not
love
me
i
will
kill
him
no
other
woman
shall
have
no
abbe
no
cried
the
young
chief
in
a
loud
voice
which
was
heard
through
the
panel
it
must
be
monsieur
le
marquis
replied
the
abbe
gudin
haughtily
you
will
scandalize
all
brittany
if
you
give
that
ball
at
saint
james
it
is
preaching
not
dancing
which
will
rouse
our
villagers
take
guns
not
abbe
you
have
sense
enough
to
know
that
it
is
not
in
a
general
assembly
of
our
partisans
that
i
can
learn
to
know
these
people
or
judge
of
what
i
may
be
able
to
undertake
with
them
a
supper
is
better
for
examining
faces
than
all
the
spying
in
the
world
of
which
by
the
bye
i
have
a
horror
they
can
be
made
to
talk
with
glasses
in
their
marie
quivered
as
she
listened
and
conceived
the
idea
of
going
to
the
ball
and
there
avenging
herself
do
you
take
me
for
an
idiot
with
your
sermon
against
dancing
continued
montauran
wouldn
t
you
yourself
dance
a
reed
if
it
would
restore
your
order
under
its
new
name
of
fathers
of
the
faith
don
t
you
know
that
bretons
come
away
from
the
mass
and
go
to
dancing
are
you
aware
that
messieurs
hyde
de
neuville
and
d
andigne
had
a
conference
five
days
ago
with
the
first
consul
on
the
question
of
restoring
his
majesty
louis
ah
monsieur
the
princes
are
deceived
as
to
the
true
state
of
france
the
devotions
which
uphold
them
are
solely
those
of
rank
abbe
if
i
have
set
my
feet
in
blood
at
least
i
will
not
go
into
it
to
my
middle
without
full
knowledge
of
what
i
do
i
am
devoted
to
the
king
but
not
to
four
not
to
a
man
crippled
with
debt
like
rifoel
not
to
chauffeurs
not
to
say
frankly
monsieur
not
to
abbes
who
force
contributions
on
the
highway
to
carry
on
the
war
retorted
the
abbe
gudin
why
should
i
not
say
it
replied
the
marquis
sharply
and
i
ll
say
further
that
the
great
and
heroic
days
of
la
vendee
are
monsieur
le
marquis
we
can
perform
miracles
without
yes
like
that
of
marie
lambrequin
whom
i
hear
you
have
brought
to
life
said
the
marquis
smiling
come
come
let
us
have
no
rancor
abbe
i
know
that
you
run
all
risks
and
would
shoot
a
blue
as
readily
as
you
say
an
god
willing
i
hope
to
make
you
assist
with
a
mitre
on
your
head
at
the
king
s
this
last
remark
must
have
had
some
magic
power
for
the
click
of
a
musket
was
heard
as
the
abbe
exclaimed
i
have
fifty
cartridges
in
my
pocket
monsieur
le
marquis
and
my
life
is
the
king
he
s
a
debtor
of
mine
whispered
the
usurer
to
marie
i
don
t
mean
the
five
or
six
hundred
crowns
he
has
borrowed
but
a
debt
of
blood
which
i
hope
to
make
him
pay
he
can
never
suffer
as
much
evil
as
i
wish
him
the
damned
jesuit
he
swore
the
death
of
my
brother
and
raised
the
country
against
him
why
because
the
poor
man
was
afraid
of
the
new
then
after
applying
his
ear
to
another
part
of
his
he
added
they
are
all
decamping
those
brigands
i
suppose
they
are
going
to
do
some
other
miracle
elsewhere
i
only
hope
they
won
t
bid
me
as
they
did
the
last
time
by
setting
fire
to
my
after
the
lapse
of
about
half
an
hour
during
which
time
the
usurer
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
looked
at
each
other
as
if
they
were
studying
a
picture
the
coarse
gruff
voice
of
was
heard
saying
in
a
muffled
tone
there
s
no
longer
any
danger
monsieur
d
orgemont
but
this
time
you
must
allow
that
i
have
earned
my
thirty
my
dear
said
the
miser
to
marie
swear
to
shut
your
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
placed
one
hand
over
her
eyelids
but
for
greater
security
d
orgemont
blew
out
the
lamp
took
his
liberator
by
the
hand
and
helped
her
to
make
seven
or
eight
steps
along
a
difficult
passage
at
the
end
of
some
minutes
he
gently
removed
her
hand
and
she
found
herself
in
the
very
room
the
marquis
de
montauran
had
just
quitted
and
which
was
in
fact
the
miser
s
own
bedroom
my
dear
girl
said
the
old
man
you
can
safely
go
now
don
t
look
about
you
that
way
i
dare
say
you
have
no
money
with
you
here
are
ten
crowns
they
are
a
little
shaved
but
they
ll
pass
when
you
leave
the
garden
you
will
see
a
path
that
leads
straight
to
the
town
or
as
they
say
now
the
district
but
the
chouans
will
be
at
fougeres
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
you
can
t
get
back
there
at
once
you
may
want
some
safe
place
to
hide
in
remember
what
i
say
to
you
but
don
t
make
use
of
it
unless
in
some
great
emergency
you
will
see
on
the
road
which
leads
to
through
the
val
de
gibarry
a
farmhouse
belonging
to
cibot
otherwise
called
go
in
and
say
to
his
wife
becaniere
and
barbette
will
hide
you
if
discovers
you
he
will
either
take
you
for
the
ghost
if
it
is
dark
or
ten
crowns
will
master
him
if
it
is
light
adieu
our
account
is
squared
but
if
you
choose
he
added
waving
his
hand
about
him
all
this
is
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
gave
the
strange
old
man
a
look
of
thanks
and
succeeded
in
extracting
a
sigh
from
him
expressing
a
variety
of
emotions
you
will
of
course
return
me
my
ten
crowns
and
please
remark
that
i
ask
no
interest
you
can
pay
them
to
my
credit
with
maitre
patrat
the
notary
at
fougeres
who
would
draw
our
marriage
contract
if
you
consented
to
be
mine
adieu
she
said
smiling
and
waving
her
hand
if
you
ever
want
money
he
called
after
her
i
ll
lend
it
to
you
at
five
per
cent
yes
only
five
did
i
say
five
why
she
s
gone
that
girl
looks
to
me
like
a
good
one
nevertheless
i
ll
change
the
secret
opening
of
my
then
he
took
a
loaf
and
a
ham
and
returned
to
his
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
walked
through
the
country
she
seemed
to
breathe
a
new
life
the
freshness
of
the
night
revived
her
after
the
fiery
experience
of
the
last
few
hours
she
tried
to
follow
the
path
explained
to
her
by
d
orgemont
but
the
darkness
became
so
dense
after
the
moon
had
gone
down
that
she
was
forced
to
walk
blindly
presently
the
fear
of
falling
down
some
precipice
seized
her
and
saved
her
life
for
she
stopped
suddenly
fancying
the
ground
would
disappear
before
her
if
she
made
another
step
a
cool
breeze
lifting
her
hair
the
murmur
of
the
river
and
her
instinct
all
combined
to
warn
her
that
she
was
probably
on
the
verge
of
the
rocks
she
slipped
her
arm
around
a
tree
and
waited
for
dawn
with
keen
anxiety
for
she
heard
a
noise
of
arms
and
horses
and
human
voices
she
was
grateful
to
the
darkness
which
saved
her
from
the
chouans
who
were
evidently
as
the
miser
had
said
surrounding
fougeres
like
fires
lit
at
night
as
signals
of
liberty
a
few
gleams
faintly
crimsoned
began
to
show
upon
the
summits
while
the
bases
of
the
mountains
still
retained
the
bluish
tints
which
contrasted
with
the
rosy
clouds
that
were
floating
in
the
valley
soon
a
ruby
disk
rose
slowly
on
the
horizon
and
the
skies
greeted
it
the
varied
landscape
the
of
the
rocks
the
meadows
buried
in
shadow
all
insensibly
reappeared
and
the
trees
on
the
summits
were
defined
against
the
skies
in
the
rising
glow
the
sun
freed
itself
with
a
graceful
spring
from
the
ribbons
of
flame
and
ochre
and
sapphire
its
vivid
light
took
level
lines
from
hill
to
hill
and
flowed
into
the
vales
the
dusk
dispersed
day
mastered
nature
a
sharp
breeze
crisped
the
air
the
birds
sang
life
wakened
everywhere
but
the
girl
had
hardly
time
to
cast
her
eyes
over
the
whole
of
this
wondrous
landscape
before
by
a
phenomenon
not
infrequent
in
these
cool
regions
the
mists
spread
themselves
in
sheets
filled
the
valleys
and
rose
to
the
tops
of
the
mountains
burying
the
great
valley
beneath
a
mantle
of
snow
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
fancied
for
a
moment
she
saw
a
de
like
those
of
the
alps
then
the
vaporous
atmosphere
rolled
like
the
waves
of
ocean
lifted
impenetrable
billows
which
softly
swayed
undulated
and
were
violently
whirled
catching
from
the
sun
s
rays
a
vivid
rosy
tint
and
showing
here
and
there
in
their
depths
the
transparencies
of
a
lake
of
molten
silver
suddenly
the
north
wind
swept
this
phantasmagoric
scene
and
scattered
the
mists
which
laid
a
dew
full
of
oxygen
on
the
meadows
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
now
able
to
distinguish
a
dark
mass
of
men
on
the
rocks
of
fougeres
seven
or
eight
hundred
chouans
were
running
like
ants
through
the
suburb
of
the
sleeping
town
would
certainly
have
been
overpowered
in
spite
of
its
fortifications
and
its
old
gray
towers
if
hulot
had
not
been
alert
a
battery
concealed
on
a
height
at
the
farther
end
of
the
basin
formed
by
the
ramparts
replied
to
the
first
fire
of
the
chouans
by
taking
them
diagonally
on
the
road
to
the
castle
the
balls
swept
the
road
then
a
company
of
blues
made
a
sortie
from
the
gate
profited
by
the
surprise
of
the
royalists
to
form
in
line
upon
the
and
poured
a
murderous
fire
upon
them
the
chouans
made
no
attempt
to
resist
seeing
that
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
were
covered
with
soldiers
and
that
the
guns
of
the
fortress
sufficiently
protected
the
republican
advance
meantime
however
other
chouans
masters
of
the
little
valley
of
the
nancon
had
swarmed
up
the
rocks
and
reached
the
promenade
which
was
soon
covered
with
goatskins
giving
it
to
marie
s
eyes
the
appearance
of
a
thatched
roof
brown
with
age
at
the
same
moment
loud
reports
were
heard
from
the
part
of
the
town
which
overlooks
the
valley
of
couesnon
evidently
fougeres
was
attacked
on
all
sides
and
completely
surrounded
flames
rising
on
the
western
side
of
the
rock
showed
that
the
chouans
were
setting
fire
to
the
suburbs
but
these
soon
ceased
and
a
column
of
black
smoke
which
succeeded
them
showed
that
the
fire
was
extinguished
brown
and
white
clouds
again
hid
the
scene
from
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
but
they
were
clouds
of
smoke
from
the
fire
and
powder
which
the
wind
dispersed
the
republican
commander
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
first
orders
admirably
executed
changed
the
direction
of
his
battery
so
as
to
sweep
successively
the
valley
of
the
nancon
the
queen
s
staircase
and
the
base
of
the
rock
of
fougeres
two
guns
posted
at
the
gate
of
scattered
the
of
chouans
who
had
seized
that
position
and
the
national
guard
of
the
town
rushing
in
haste
to
the
square
before
the
church
succeeded
in
dislodging
the
enemy
the
fight
lasted
only
half
an
hour
and
cost
the
blues
a
hundred
men
the
chouans
beaten
on
all
sides
retreated
under
orders
from
the
gars
whose
bold
attempt
failed
although
he
did
not
know
this
in
consequence
of
the
massacre
at
la
vivetiere
which
had
brought
hulot
secretly
and
in
all
haste
to
fougeres
the
artillery
had
arrived
only
that
evening
and
the
news
had
not
reached
montauran
otherwise
he
would
certainly
have
abandoned
an
enterprise
which
if
it
failed
could
only
have
bad
results
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
guns
the
marquis
knew
it
would
be
madness
to
continue
out
of
mere
pride
a
surprise
which
had
missed
fire
therefore
not
to
lose
men
uselessly
he
sent
at
once
to
all
points
of
the
attack
ordering
an
immediate
retreat
the
commandant
seeing
his
adversary
on
the
rocks
of
surrounded
by
a
council
of
men
endeavored
to
pour
a
volley
upon
him
but
the
spot
was
cleverly
selected
and
the
young
leader
was
out
of
danger
in
a
moment
hulot
now
changed
parts
with
his
opponent
and
became
the
aggressor
at
the
first
sign
of
the
gars
intention
the
company
stationed
under
the
walls
of
the
castle
were
ordered
to
cut
off
the
chouans
retreat
by
seizing
the
upper
outlet
of
the
valley
of
the
nancon
notwithstanding
her
desire
for
revenge
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
sympathies
were
with
the
men
commanded
by
her
lover
and
she
turned
hastily
to
see
if
the
other
end
of
the
valley
were
clear
for
them
but
the
blues
conquerors
no
doubt
on
the
opposite
side
of
fougeres
were
returning
from
the
valley
of
couesnon
and
taking
possession
of
the
and
that
portion
of
the
rocks
which
overhang
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
of
the
nancon
the
chouans
thus
hemmed
in
to
the
narrow
fields
of
the
gorge
seemed
in
danger
of
perishing
to
the
last
man
so
cleverly
and
sagaciously
were
the
commandant
s
measures
taken
but
hulot
s
cannon
were
powerless
at
these
two
points
and
here
the
town
of
fougeres
being
quite
safe
began
one
of
those
desperate
struggles
which
denoted
the
character
of
chouan
warfare
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
now
comprehended
the
presence
of
the
masses
of
men
she
had
seen
as
she
left
the
town
the
meeting
of
the
leaders
at
d
orgemont
s
house
and
all
the
other
events
of
the
night
wondering
how
she
herself
had
escaped
so
many
dangers
the
attack
prompted
by
desperation
interested
her
so
keenly
that
she
stood
motionless
watching
the
living
pictures
as
they
presented
themselves
to
her
sight
presently
the
struggle
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
had
a
deeper
interest
for
her
seeing
the
blues
almost
masters
of
the
chouans
the
marquis
and
his
friends
rushed
into
the
valley
of
the
nancon
to
support
their
men
the
rocks
were
now
covered
with
straggling
groups
of
furious
combatants
deciding
the
question
of
life
or
death
on
a
ground
and
with
weapons
that
were
more
favorable
to
the
goatskins
slowly
this
moving
arena
widened
the
chouans
recovering
themselves
gained
the
rocks
thanks
to
the
shrubs
and
bushes
which
grew
here
and
there
among
them
for
a
moment
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
felt
alarmed
as
she
saw
rather
late
her
enemies
swarming
over
the
summit
and
defending
the
dangerous
paths
by
which
alone
she
could
descend
every
issue
on
the
mountain
was
occupied
by
one
or
other
of
the
two
parties
afraid
of
encountering
them
she
left
the
tree
behind
which
she
had
been
sheltering
and
began
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
which
d
orgemont
had
mentioned
to
her
after
running
some
time
on
the
slope
of
which
overlooks
the
valley
of
couesnon
she
saw
a
in
the
distance
and
thought
it
must
belong
to
the
house
of
who
had
doubtless
left
his
wife
at
home
and
alone
during
the
fight
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
hoped
to
be
able
to
pass
a
few
hours
in
this
retreat
until
it
was
possible
for
her
to
return
to
fougeres
without
danger
according
to
all
appearance
hulot
was
to
triumph
the
chouans
were
retreating
so
rapidly
that
she
heard
firing
all
about
her
and
the
fear
of
being
shot
made
her
hasten
to
the
cottage
the
chimney
of
which
was
her
landmark
the
path
she
was
following
ended
at
a
sort
of
shed
covered
with
a
supported
by
four
stout
trees
with
the
bark
still
on
them
a
mud
wall
formed
the
back
of
this
shed
under
which
were
a
a
flail
to
thresh
buckwheat
and
several
agricultural
implements
she
stopped
before
one
of
the
posts
unwilling
to
cross
the
dirty
bog
which
formed
a
sort
of
courtyard
to
the
house
which
in
her
parisian
ignorance
she
had
taken
for
a
stable
the
cabin
protected
from
the
north
wind
by
an
eminence
towering
above
the
roof
which
rested
against
it
was
not
without
a
poetry
of
its
own
for
the
tender
shoots
of
elms
heather
and
various
wreathed
it
with
garlands
a
rustic
staircase
constructed
between
the
shed
and
the
house
enabled
the
inhabitants
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
rock
and
breathe
a
purer
air
on
the
left
the
eminence
sloped
abruptly
down
giving
to
view
a
series
of
fields
the
first
of
which
belonged
no
doubt
to
this
farm
these
fields
were
like
bowers
separated
by
banks
which
were
planted
with
trees
the
road
which
led
to
them
was
barred
by
the
trunk
of
an
old
tree
a
breton
method
of
enclosure
the
name
of
which
may
furnish
further
on
a
digression
which
will
complete
the
characterization
of
this
region
between
the
stairway
cut
in
the
schist
rock
and
the
path
closed
by
this
old
tree
in
front
of
the
marsh
and
beneath
the
overhanging
rock
several
granite
blocks
roughly
hewn
and
piled
one
upon
the
other
formed
the
four
corners
of
the
cottage
and
held
up
the
planks
cobblestones
and
pitch
amalgam
of
which
the
walls
were
made
the
fact
that
one
half
of
the
roof
was
covered
with
furze
instead
of
thatch
and
the
other
with
shingles
or
bits
of
board
cut
into
the
form
of
slates
showed
that
the
building
was
in
two
parts
one
half
with
a
broken
hurdle
for
a
door
served
as
a
stable
the
other
half
was
the
dwelling
of
the
owner
though
this
hut
owed
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
town
a
few
improvements
which
were
wholly
absent
from
such
buildings
that
were
five
or
six
miles
further
off
it
showed
plainly
enough
the
instability
of
domestic
life
and
habits
to
which
the
wars
and
customs
of
feudality
had
reduced
the
serf
even
to
this
day
many
of
the
peasants
of
those
parts
call
a
seignorial
chateau
the
while
examining
the
place
with
an
astonishment
we
can
readily
conceive
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
noticed
here
and
there
in
the
filth
of
the
courtyard
a
few
bits
of
granite
so
placed
as
to
form
to
the
house
hearing
the
sound
of
musketry
that
was
evidently
coming
nearer
she
jumped
from
stone
to
stone
as
if
crossing
a
rivulet
to
ask
shelter
the
house
was
closed
by
a
door
opening
in
two
parts
the
lower
one
of
wood
heavy
and
massive
the
upper
one
a
shutter
which
served
as
a
window
in
many
of
the
smaller
towns
of
france
the
shops
have
the
same
type
of
door
though
far
more
decorated
the
lower
half
possessing
a
the
door
in
question
opened
with
a
wooden
latch
worthy
of
the
golden
age
and
the
upper
part
was
never
closed
except
at
night
for
it
was
the
only
opening
through
which
daylight
could
enter
the
room
there
was
to
be
sure
a
clumsy
window
but
the
glass
was
thick
like
the
bottom
of
a
bottle
and
the
lead
which
held
the
panes
in
place
took
so
much
room
that
the
opening
seemed
intended
to
intercept
the
light
rather
than
admit
it
as
soon
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
turned
the
creaking
hinges
of
the
lower
door
she
smelt
an
intolerable
ammoniacal
odor
and
saw
that
the
beasts
in
the
stable
had
kicked
through
the
inner
partition
which
separated
the
stable
from
the
dwelling
the
interior
of
the
farmhouse
for
such
it
was
did
not
belie
its
exterior
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
asking
herself
how
it
was
possible
for
human
beings
to
live
in
such
habitual
filth
when
a
ragged
boy
about
eight
or
nine
years
old
suddenly
presented
his
fresh
and
rosy
face
with
a
pair
of
fat
cheeks
lively
eyes
ivory
teeth
and
a
mass
of
fair
hair
which
fell
in
curls
upon
his
shoulders
his
limbs
were
vigorous
and
his
attitude
had
the
charm
of
that
amazement
and
naive
curiosity
which
widens
a
child
s
eyes
the
little
fellow
was
a
picture
of
beauty
where
is
your
mother
said
marie
in
a
gentle
voice
stooping
to
kiss
him
between
the
eyes
after
receiving
her
kiss
the
child
slipped
away
like
an
eel
and
disappeared
behind
a
which
was
piled
at
the
top
of
a
mound
between
the
path
and
the
house
for
like
many
breton
farmers
who
have
a
system
of
agriculture
that
is
all
their
own
put
his
manure
in
an
elevated
spot
so
that
by
the
time
it
was
wanted
for
use
the
rains
had
deprived
it
of
all
its
virtue
alone
for
a
few
minutes
marie
had
time
to
make
an
inventory
the
room
in
which
she
waited
for
barbette
was
the
whole
house
the
most
obvious
and
sumptuous
object
was
a
vast
fireplace
with
a
of
blue
granite
the
etymology
of
that
word
was
shown
by
a
strip
of
green
serge
edged
with
a
ribbon
cut
in
scallops
which
covered
and
overhung
the
whole
shelf
on
which
stood
a
colored
plaster
cast
of
the
holy
virgin
on
the
pedestal
of
the
statuette
were
two
lines
of
a
religious
poem
very
popular
in
brittany
i
am
the
mother
of
god
protectress
of
the
behind
the
virgin
a
hideous
image
daubed
with
red
and
blue
under
pretence
of
painting
represented
a
green
serge
bed
of
the
shape
called
tomb
a
clumsy
cradle
a
common
chairs
and
a
carved
chest
on
which
lay
utensils
were
about
the
whole
of
s
domestic
possessions
in
front
of
the
window
stood
a
chestnut
table
flanked
by
two
benches
of
the
same
wood
to
which
the
sombre
light
coming
through
the
thick
panes
gave
the
tone
of
mahogany
an
immense
cask
of
cider
under
the
bung
of
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
noticed
a
pool
of
yellow
mud
which
had
decomposed
the
flooring
although
it
was
made
of
scraps
of
granite
conglomerated
in
clay
proved
that
the
master
of
the
house
had
a
right
to
his
chouan
name
and
that
the
pints
galloped
down
either
his
own
throat
or
that
of
his
friends
two
enormous
jugs
full
of
cider
stood
on
the
table
marie
s
attention
caught
at
first
by
the
innumerable
spider
which
hung
from
the
roof
was
fixing
itself
on
these
pitchers
when
the
noise
of
fighting
growing
more
and
more
distinct
impelled
her
to
find
a
without
waiting
for
the
woman
of
the
house
who
however
appeared
at
that
moment
becaniere
said
marie
restraining
a
smile
at
the
appearance
of
a
person
who
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
heads
which
architects
attach
to
ha
you
come
from
d
orgemont
answered
barbette
in
a
tone
that
was
far
from
cordial
yes
where
can
you
hide
me
for
the
chouans
are
close
by
there
replied
barbette
as
much
amazed
at
the
beauty
as
by
the
strange
apparel
of
a
being
she
could
hardly
believe
to
be
of
her
own
sex
there
in
the
priest
s
she
took
her
to
the
head
of
the
bed
and
was
putting
her
behind
it
when
they
were
both
startled
by
the
noise
of
a
man
springing
into
the
courtyard
barbette
had
scarcely
time
to
drop
the
curtain
of
the
bed
and
fold
it
about
the
girl
before
she
was
face
to
face
with
a
fugitive
chouan
where
can
i
hide
old
woman
i
am
the
comte
de
bauvan
said
the
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
quivered
as
she
recognized
the
voice
of
the
belated
guest
whose
words
still
a
secret
to
her
brought
about
the
catastrophe
of
la
vivetiere
alas
monseigneur
don
t
you
see
i
have
no
place
what
i
d
better
do
is
to
keep
outside
and
watch
that
no
one
gets
in
if
the
blues
come
i
ll
let
you
know
if
i
stay
here
and
they
find
me
with
you
they
ll
burn
my
house
barbette
left
the
hut
feeling
herself
incapable
of
settling
the
interests
of
two
enemies
who
in
virtue
of
the
double
role
her
husband
was
playing
had
an
equal
right
to
her
i
ve
only
two
shots
left
said
the
count
in
despair
it
will
be
very
unlucky
if
those
fellows
turn
back
now
and
take
a
fancy
to
look
under
this
he
placed
his
gun
gently
against
the
headboard
behind
which
marie
was
standing
among
the
folds
of
the
green
serge
and
stooped
to
see
if
there
was
room
for
him
under
the
bed
he
would
infallibly
have
seen
her
feet
but
she
rendered
desperate
by
her
danger
seized
his
gun
jumped
quickly
into
the
room
and
threatened
him
the
count
broke
into
a
peal
of
laughter
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
for
in
order
to
hide
herself
marie
had
taken
off
her
chouan
hat
and
her
hair
was
escaping
in
heavy
curls
from
the
lace
scarf
which
she
had
worn
on
leaving
home
don
t
laugh
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
my
prisoner
if
you
make
the
least
movement
you
shall
know
what
an
offended
woman
is
capable
of
as
the
count
and
marie
stood
looking
at
each
other
with
differing
emotions
confused
voices
were
heard
without
among
the
rocks
calling
out
save
the
gars
spread
out
spread
out
save
the
gars
barbette
s
voice
calling
to
her
boy
was
heard
above
the
tumult
with
very
different
sensations
by
the
two
enemies
to
whom
barbette
was
really
speaking
instead
of
to
her
son
don
t
you
see
the
blues
she
cried
sharply
come
here
you
little
scamp
or
i
shall
be
after
you
do
you
want
to
be
shot
come
hide
quick
while
these
things
took
place
rapidly
a
blue
jumped
into
the
marshy
courtyard
exclaimed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
hearing
her
voice
rushed
into
the
cottage
and
aimed
at
the
count
aristocrat
he
cried
don
t
stir
or
i
ll
demolish
you
in
a
wink
like
the
monsieur
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
in
a
persuasive
voice
you
will
be
answerable
to
me
for
this
prisoner
do
as
you
like
with
him
now
but
you
must
return
him
to
me
safe
and
sound
at
enough
madame
is
the
road
to
fougeres
clear
yes
it
s
safe
enough
unless
the
chouans
come
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
picked
up
the
count
s
gun
gaily
and
smiled
satirically
as
she
said
to
her
prisoner
adieu
monsieur
le
comte
au
revoir
then
she
darted
down
the
path
having
replaced
the
broad
hat
upon
her
head
i
have
learned
too
late
said
the
count
not
to
joke
about
the
virtue
of
a
woman
who
has
aristocrat
cried
sternly
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
send
you
to
your
paradise
you
will
not
say
a
word
against
that
beautiful
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
returned
to
fougeres
by
the
paths
which
connect
the
rocks
of
with
the
when
she
reached
the
latter
height
and
had
threaded
the
winding
way
cut
in
its
rough
granite
she
stopped
to
admire
the
pretty
valley
of
the
nancon
lately
so
turbulent
and
now
so
tranquil
seen
from
that
point
the
vale
was
like
a
street
of
verdure
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
town
by
the
porte
the
inhabitants
still
uneasy
about
the
fighting
which
judging
by
the
distant
firing
was
still
going
on
were
waiting
the
return
of
the
national
guard
to
judge
of
their
losses
seeing
the
girl
in
her
strange
costume
her
hair
dishevelled
a
gun
in
her
hand
her
shawl
and
gown
whitened
against
the
walls
soiled
with
mud
and
wet
with
dew
the
curiosity
of
the
people
was
keenly
excited
all
the
more
because
the
power
beauty
and
singularity
of
this
young
parisian
had
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
francine
full
of
dreadful
fears
had
waited
for
her
mistress
throughout
the
night
and
when
she
saw
her
she
began
to
speak
but
marie
with
a
kindly
gesture
silenced
her
i
am
not
dead
my
child
she
said
ah
she
added
after
a
pause
i
wanted
emotions
when
i
left
paris
and
i
have
had
them
francine
asked
if
she
should
get
her
some
food
observing
that
she
must
be
in
great
need
of
it
no
no
a
bath
a
bath
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
i
must
dress
at
francine
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
her
mistress
required
her
to
unpack
the
most
elegant
of
the
dresses
she
had
brought
with
her
having
bathed
and
breakfasted
marie
made
her
toilet
with
all
the
minute
care
which
a
woman
gives
to
that
important
act
when
she
expects
to
meet
the
eyes
of
her
lover
in
a
francine
could
not
explain
to
herself
the
mocking
gaiety
of
her
mistress
it
was
not
the
joy
of
love
a
woman
never
mistakes
that
it
was
rather
an
expression
of
concentrated
maliciousness
which
to
francine
s
mind
boded
evil
marie
herself
drew
the
curtains
of
the
window
from
which
the
glorious
panorama
could
be
seen
then
she
moved
the
sofa
to
the
chimney
corner
turning
it
so
that
the
light
would
fall
becomingly
on
her
face
then
she
told
francine
to
fetch
flowers
that
the
room
might
have
a
festive
air
and
when
they
came
she
herself
directed
their
arrangement
in
a
picturesque
manner
giving
a
last
glance
of
satisfaction
at
these
various
preparations
she
sent
francine
to
the
commandant
with
a
request
that
he
would
bring
her
prisoner
to
her
then
she
lay
down
luxuriously
on
a
sofa
partly
to
rest
and
partly
to
throw
herself
into
an
attitude
of
graceful
weakness
the
power
of
which
is
irresistible
in
certain
women
a
soft
languor
the
seductive
pose
of
her
feet
just
seen
below
the
drapery
of
her
gown
the
plastic
ease
of
her
body
the
curving
of
the
throat
all
even
the
droop
of
her
slender
fingers
as
they
hung
from
the
pillow
like
the
buds
of
a
bunch
of
jasmine
combined
with
her
eyes
to
produce
seduction
she
burned
certain
perfumes
to
fill
the
air
with
those
subtle
emanations
which
affect
men
s
fibres
powerfully
and
often
prepare
the
way
for
conquests
which
women
seek
to
make
without
seeming
to
desire
them
presently
the
heavy
step
of
the
old
soldier
resounded
in
the
adjoining
room
well
commandant
where
is
my
captive
she
said
i
have
just
ordered
a
picket
of
twelve
men
to
shoot
him
being
taken
with
arms
in
his
why
have
you
disposed
of
my
prisoner
she
asked
listen
to
me
commandant
surely
if
i
can
trust
your
face
the
death
of
a
man
a
fight
is
no
particular
satisfaction
to
you
well
then
give
my
chouan
a
reprieve
for
which
i
will
be
responsible
and
let
me
see
him
i
assure
you
that
aristocrat
has
become
essential
to
me
and
he
can
be
made
to
further
the
success
of
our
plans
besides
to
shoot
a
mere
amateur
in
chouannerie
would
be
as
absurd
as
to
fire
on
a
balloon
when
a
pinprick
would
disinflate
it
for
heaven
s
sake
leave
cruelty
to
the
aristocracy
republicans
ought
to
be
generous
wouldn
t
you
and
yours
have
forgiven
the
victims
of
quiberon
come
send
your
twelve
men
to
patrol
the
town
and
dine
with
me
and
bring
the
prisoner
there
is
only
an
hour
of
daylight
left
and
don
t
you
see
she
added
smiling
that
if
you
are
too
late
my
toilet
will
have
lost
its
effect
but
mademoiselle
said
the
commandant
amazed
well
what
but
i
know
what
you
mean
don
t
be
anxious
the
count
shall
not
escape
sooner
or
later
that
big
butterfly
will
burn
himself
in
your
the
commandant
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
forced
to
obey
whether
he
will
or
no
the
commands
of
a
pretty
woman
and
he
returned
in
about
half
an
hour
followed
by
the
comte
de
bauvan
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
feigned
surprise
and
seemed
confused
that
the
count
should
see
her
in
such
a
negligent
attitude
then
after
reading
in
his
eyes
that
her
first
effect
was
produced
she
rose
and
busied
herself
about
her
guests
with
courtesy
there
was
nothing
studied
or
forced
in
her
motions
smiles
behavior
or
voice
nothing
that
betrayed
premeditation
or
purpose
all
was
harmonious
no
part
was
an
observer
could
not
have
supposed
that
she
affected
the
manners
of
a
society
in
which
she
had
not
lived
when
the
royalist
and
the
republic
were
seated
she
looked
sternly
at
the
count
he
on
his
part
knew
women
sufficiently
well
to
feel
certain
that
the
offence
he
had
committed
against
this
woman
was
equivalent
to
a
sentence
of
death
but
in
spite
of
this
conviction
and
without
seeming
either
gay
or
gloomy
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
did
not
take
such
serious
results
into
consideration
in
fact
he
really
thought
it
ridiculous
to
fear
death
in
presence
of
a
pretty
woman
marie
s
stern
manner
roused
ideas
in
his
mind
who
knows
thought
he
whether
a
count
s
coronet
wouldn
t
please
her
as
well
as
that
of
her
lost
marquis
montauran
is
as
lean
as
a
nail
while
i
and
he
looked
himself
over
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
at
any
rate
i
should
save
my
these
diplomatic
revelations
were
wasted
the
passion
the
count
proposed
to
feign
for
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
became
a
violent
caprice
which
the
dangerous
creature
did
her
best
to
heighten
monsieur
le
comte
she
said
you
are
my
prisoner
and
i
have
the
right
to
dispose
of
you
your
execution
can
not
take
place
without
my
consent
and
i
have
too
much
curiosity
to
let
them
shoot
you
at
and
suppose
i
am
obstinate
enough
to
keep
silence
he
replied
gaily
with
an
honest
woman
perhaps
but
with
a
woman
of
the
town
no
no
monsieur
le
comte
impossible
these
words
full
of
bitter
sarcasm
were
hissed
as
sully
says
in
speaking
of
the
duchesse
de
beaufort
from
so
sharp
a
beak
that
the
count
amazed
merely
looked
at
his
antagonist
but
she
continued
with
a
scornful
glance
not
to
contradict
you
if
i
am
a
creature
of
that
kind
i
will
act
like
one
here
is
your
gun
and
she
offered
him
his
weapon
with
a
mocking
air
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
mademoiselle
ah
she
said
interrupting
him
i
have
had
enough
of
the
honor
of
gentlemen
it
was
on
the
faith
of
that
that
i
went
to
la
vivetiere
your
leader
had
sworn
to
me
that
i
and
my
escort
should
be
safe
what
an
infamy
cried
hulot
contracting
his
brows
the
fault
lies
with
monsieur
le
comte
said
marie
addressing
hulot
i
have
no
doubt
the
gars
meant
to
keep
his
word
but
this
gentleman
told
some
calumny
about
me
which
confirmed
those
that
charette
s
mistress
had
already
invented
mademoiselle
said
the
count
much
troubled
with
my
head
under
the
axe
i
would
swear
that
i
said
nothing
but
the
in
saying
what
that
you
were
the
say
the
word
mistress
of
the
marquis
de
lenoncourt
the
present
duke
a
friend
of
mine
replied
the
count
now
i
can
let
you
go
to
execution
she
said
without
seeming
at
all
agitated
by
the
outspoken
reply
of
the
count
who
was
amazed
at
the
real
or
pretended
indifference
with
which
she
heard
his
statement
however
she
added
laughing
you
have
not
wronged
me
more
than
that
friend
of
whom
you
suppose
me
to
have
been
the
fie
monsieur
le
comte
surely
you
used
to
visit
my
father
the
duc
de
verneuil
yes
well
then
evidently
considering
hulot
one
too
many
for
the
confidence
she
was
about
to
make
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
motioned
the
count
to
her
side
and
said
a
few
words
in
her
ear
monsieur
de
bauvan
gave
a
low
ejaculation
of
surprise
and
looked
with
bewilderment
at
marie
who
completed
the
effect
of
her
words
by
leaning
against
the
chimney
in
the
artless
and
innocent
attitude
of
a
child
mademoiselle
cried
the
count
i
entreat
your
forgiveness
unworthy
as
i
am
of
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
she
replied
you
have
no
more
ground
for
repentance
than
you
had
for
the
insolent
supposition
you
proclaimed
at
la
vivetiere
but
this
is
a
matter
beyond
your
comprehension
only
remember
this
monsieur
le
comte
the
daughter
of
the
duc
de
verneuil
has
too
generous
a
spirit
not
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
your
even
after
i
have
insulted
you
said
the
count
with
a
sort
of
regret
some
are
placed
so
high
that
insult
can
not
touch
them
monsieur
le
comte
i
am
one
of
as
she
said
the
words
the
girl
assumed
an
air
of
pride
and
nobility
which
impressed
the
prisoner
and
made
the
whole
of
this
strange
intrigue
much
less
clear
to
hulot
than
the
old
soldier
had
thought
it
he
twirled
his
moustache
and
looked
uneasily
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
made
him
a
sign
as
if
to
say
she
was
still
carrying
out
her
plan
now
continued
marie
after
a
pause
let
us
discuss
these
matters
francine
my
dear
bring
she
adroitly
led
the
conversation
to
the
times
which
had
now
within
a
few
short
years
become
the
ancien
she
brought
back
that
period
to
the
count
s
mind
by
the
liveliness
of
her
remarks
and
sketches
and
gave
him
so
many
opportunities
to
display
his
wit
by
cleverly
throwing
repartees
in
his
way
that
he
ended
by
thinking
he
had
never
been
so
charming
and
that
idea
having
rejuvenated
him
he
endeavored
to
inspire
this
seductive
young
woman
with
his
own
good
opinion
of
himself
the
malicious
creature
practised
in
return
every
art
of
her
coquetry
upon
him
all
the
more
adroitly
because
it
was
mere
play
to
her
sometimes
she
let
him
think
he
was
making
rapid
progress
and
then
as
if
surprised
at
the
sentiment
she
was
feeling
she
showed
a
sudden
coolness
which
charmed
him
and
served
to
increase
imperceptibly
his
impromptu
passion
she
was
like
a
fisherman
who
lifts
his
line
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
the
fish
is
biting
the
poor
count
allowed
himself
to
be
deceived
by
the
innocent
air
with
which
she
accepted
two
or
three
neatly
turned
compliments
emigration
brittany
the
republic
and
the
chouans
were
far
indeed
from
his
thoughts
hulot
sat
erect
and
silent
as
the
god
thermes
his
want
of
education
made
him
quite
incapable
of
taking
part
in
a
conversation
of
this
kind
he
supposed
that
the
talking
pair
were
very
witty
but
his
efforts
at
comprehension
were
limited
to
discovering
whether
they
were
plotting
against
the
republic
in
covert
language
montauran
the
count
was
saying
has
birth
and
breeding
he
is
a
charming
fellow
but
he
doesn
t
understand
gallantry
he
is
too
young
to
have
seen
versailles
his
education
is
deficient
instead
of
diplomatically
defaming
he
strikes
a
blow
he
may
be
able
to
love
violently
but
he
will
never
have
that
fine
flower
of
breeding
in
his
gallantry
which
distinguished
lauzun
adhemar
coigny
and
so
many
others
he
hasn
t
the
winning
art
of
saying
those
pretty
nothings
to
women
which
after
all
they
like
better
than
bursts
of
passion
which
soon
weary
them
yes
though
he
has
undoubtedly
had
many
he
has
neither
the
grace
nor
the
ease
that
should
belong
to
i
have
noticed
that
myself
said
marie
ah
thought
the
count
there
s
an
inflection
in
her
voice
and
a
look
in
her
eye
which
shows
me
plainly
i
shall
soon
be
with
her
and
faith
to
get
her
i
ll
believe
all
she
wants
me
he
offered
her
his
hand
for
dinner
was
now
announced
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
did
the
honors
with
a
politeness
and
tact
which
could
only
have
been
acquired
by
the
life
and
training
of
a
court
leave
us
she
whispered
to
hulot
as
they
left
the
table
you
will
only
frighten
him
whereas
if
i
am
alone
with
him
i
shall
soon
find
out
all
i
want
to
know
he
has
reached
the
point
where
a
man
tells
me
everything
he
thinks
and
sees
through
my
eyes
but
afterwards
said
hulot
evidently
intending
to
claim
the
prisoner
afterwards
he
is
to
be
free
free
as
air
she
replied
but
he
was
taken
with
arms
in
his
no
she
said
making
one
of
those
sophistical
jokes
with
which
women
parry
unanswerable
arguments
i
had
disarmed
him
count
she
said
turning
back
to
him
as
hulot
departed
i
have
just
obtained
your
liberty
but
nothing
for
nothing
she
added
laughing
with
her
head
on
one
side
as
if
to
interrogate
him
ask
all
even
my
name
and
my
honor
he
cried
intoxicated
i
lay
them
at
your
he
advanced
to
seize
her
hand
trying
to
make
her
take
his
passion
for
gratitude
but
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
not
a
woman
to
be
thus
misled
so
smiling
in
a
way
to
give
some
hope
to
this
new
lover
she
drew
back
a
few
steps
and
said
you
might
make
me
regret
my
the
imagination
of
a
young
girl
is
more
rapid
than
that
of
a
woman
he
answered
laughing
a
young
girl
has
more
to
lose
than
a
true
those
who
carry
a
treasure
ought
to
be
let
us
quit
such
conventional
language
she
said
and
talk
seriously
you
are
to
give
a
ball
at
i
hear
that
your
headquarters
arsenals
and
base
of
supplies
are
there
when
is
the
ball
to
be
you
will
not
be
surprised
if
a
slandered
woman
desires
with
a
woman
s
obstinacy
to
obtain
a
public
reparation
for
the
insults
offered
to
her
in
presence
of
those
who
witnessed
them
i
shall
go
to
your
ball
i
ask
you
to
give
me
your
protection
from
the
moment
i
enter
the
room
until
i
leave
it
i
ask
nothing
more
than
a
promise
she
added
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
i
abhor
oaths
they
are
too
like
precautions
tell
me
only
that
you
engage
to
protect
my
person
from
all
dangers
criminal
or
shameful
promise
to
repair
the
wrong
you
did
me
by
openly
acknowledging
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
duc
de
verneuil
but
say
nothing
of
the
trials
i
have
borne
in
being
illegitimate
this
will
pay
your
debt
to
me
ha
two
hours
attendance
on
a
woman
in
a
is
not
so
dear
a
ransom
for
your
life
is
it
you
are
not
worth
a
ducat
her
smile
took
the
insult
from
her
words
what
do
you
ask
for
the
gun
said
the
count
laughing
oh
more
than
i
do
for
what
is
it
secrecy
believe
me
my
dear
count
a
woman
is
never
fathomed
except
by
a
woman
i
am
certain
that
if
you
say
one
word
of
this
i
shall
be
murdered
on
my
way
to
that
ball
yesterday
i
had
warning
enough
yes
that
woman
is
quick
to
act
ah
i
implore
you
she
said
contrive
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
me
at
the
you
will
be
there
under
my
protection
said
the
count
proudly
but
he
added
with
a
doubtful
air
are
you
coming
for
the
sake
of
montauran
you
wish
to
know
more
than
i
know
myself
she
answered
laughing
now
go
she
added
after
a
pause
i
will
take
you
to
the
gate
of
the
town
myself
for
this
seems
to
me
a
cannibal
then
you
do
feel
some
interest
in
me
exclaimed
the
count
ah
mademoiselle
permit
me
to
hope
that
you
will
not
be
insensible
to
my
friendship
for
that
sentiment
must
content
me
must
it
not
he
added
with
a
conceited
air
ah
diviner
she
said
putting
on
the
gay
expression
a
woman
assumes
when
she
makes
an
avowal
which
compromises
neither
her
dignity
nor
her
secret
sentiments
then
having
slipped
on
a
pelisse
she
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
when
they
reached
the
end
of
the
path
she
said
monsieur
be
absolutely
silent
on
all
this
even
to
the
marquis
and
she
laid
her
finger
on
both
lips
the
count
emboldened
by
so
much
kindness
took
her
hand
she
let
him
do
so
as
though
it
were
a
great
favor
and
he
kissed
it
tenderly
oh
mademoiselle
he
cried
on
knowing
himself
beyond
all
danger
rely
on
me
for
life
for
death
though
i
owe
you
a
gratitude
equal
to
that
i
owe
my
mother
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
restrain
my
feelings
to
mere
he
sprang
into
the
narrow
pathway
after
watching
him
till
he
reached
the
rocks
of
marie
nodded
her
head
in
sign
of
satisfaction
saying
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
that
fat
fellow
has
given
me
more
than
his
life
for
his
life
i
can
make
him
my
creator
at
a
very
little
cost
creature
or
creator
that
s
all
the
difference
there
is
between
one
man
and
another
she
did
not
finish
her
thought
but
with
a
look
of
despair
she
turned
and
the
porte
where
hulot
and
corentin
were
awaiting
her
two
more
days
she
cried
and
then
she
stopped
observing
that
they
were
not
alone
he
shall
fall
under
your
guns
she
whispered
to
hulot
the
commandant
recoiled
a
step
and
looked
with
a
jeering
contempt
impossible
to
render
at
the
woman
whose
features
and
expression
gave
no
sign
whatever
of
relenting
there
is
one
thing
remarkable
about
women
they
never
reason
about
their
blameworthy
actions
feeling
carries
them
off
their
feet
even
in
their
dissimulation
there
is
an
element
of
sincerity
and
in
women
alone
crime
may
exist
without
baseness
for
it
often
happens
that
they
do
not
know
how
it
came
about
that
they
committed
it
i
am
going
to
to
a
ball
the
chouans
give
night
and
but
said
corentin
interrupting
her
that
is
fifteen
miles
distant
had
i
not
better
accompany
you
you
think
a
great
deal
too
much
of
something
i
never
think
of
at
all
she
replied
and
that
is
marie
s
contempt
for
corentin
was
extremely
pleasing
to
hulot
who
made
his
grimace
as
she
turned
away
in
the
direction
of
her
own
house
corentin
followed
her
with
his
eyes
letting
his
face
express
a
consciousness
of
the
fatal
power
he
knew
he
could
exercise
over
the
charming
creature
by
working
upon
the
passions
which
sooner
or
later
he
believed
would
give
her
to
him
as
soon
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
reached
home
she
began
to
deliberate
on
her
francine
accustomed
to
obey
without
understanding
her
mistress
s
motives
opened
the
trunks
and
suggested
a
greek
costume
the
republican
fashions
of
those
days
were
all
greek
in
style
marie
chose
one
which
could
be
put
in
a
box
that
was
easy
to
carry
francine
my
dear
i
am
going
on
an
excursion
into
the
country
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
or
will
you
stay
behind
stay
behind
exclaimed
francine
then
who
would
dress
you
where
have
you
put
that
glove
i
gave
you
this
morning
here
it
sew
this
green
ribbon
into
it
and
above
all
take
plenty
of
then
noticing
that
francine
was
taking
out
a
number
of
the
new
republican
coins
she
cried
out
not
those
they
would
get
us
murdered
send
jeremie
to
corentin
no
stay
the
wretch
would
follow
me
send
to
the
commandant
ask
him
from
me
for
some
with
the
feminine
sagacity
which
takes
in
the
smallest
detail
she
thought
of
everything
while
francine
was
completing
the
arrangements
for
this
extraordinary
trip
marie
practised
the
art
of
imitating
an
owl
and
so
far
succeeded
in
rivalling
that
the
illusion
was
a
good
one
at
midnight
she
left
fougeres
by
the
gate
of
took
the
little
path
to
and
started
followed
by
francine
to
cross
the
val
de
gibarry
with
a
firm
step
under
the
impulse
of
that
strong
will
which
gives
to
the
body
and
its
bearing
such
an
expression
of
force
to
leave
a
with
sufficient
care
to
avoid
a
cold
is
an
important
affair
to
the
health
of
a
woman
but
let
her
have
a
passion
in
her
heart
and
her
body
becomes
adamant
such
an
enterprise
as
marie
had
now
undertaken
would
have
floated
in
a
bold
man
s
mind
for
a
long
time
but
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
no
sooner
thought
of
it
than
its
dangers
became
to
her
attractions
you
are
starting
without
asking
god
to
bless
you
said
francine
turning
to
look
at
the
tower
of
the
pious
breton
stopped
clasped
her
hands
and
said
an
ave
to
saint
anne
of
auray
imploring
her
to
bless
their
expedition
during
which
time
her
mistress
waited
pensively
looking
first
at
the
artless
attitude
of
her
maid
who
was
praying
fervently
and
then
at
the
effects
of
the
vaporous
moonlight
as
it
glided
among
the
traceries
of
the
church
building
giving
to
the
granite
all
the
delicacy
of
filagree
the
pair
soon
reached
the
hut
of
light
as
their
steps
were
they
roused
one
of
those
huge
on
whose
fidelity
the
bretons
rely
putting
no
fastening
to
their
doors
but
a
simple
latch
the
dog
ran
to
the
strangers
and
his
bark
became
so
threatening
that
they
were
forced
to
retreat
a
few
steps
and
call
for
help
but
no
one
came
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
then
gave
the
owl
s
cry
and
instantly
the
rusty
hinges
of
the
door
made
a
creaking
sound
and
who
had
risen
hastily
put
out
his
head
i
wish
to
go
to
said
marie
showing
the
gars
glove
monsieur
le
comte
de
bauvan
told
me
that
you
would
take
me
there
and
protect
me
on
the
way
therefore
be
good
enough
to
get
us
two
riding
donkeys
and
make
yourself
ready
to
go
with
us
time
is
precious
for
if
we
do
not
get
to
before
night
i
can
neither
see
the
ball
nor
the
completely
bewildered
took
the
glove
and
turned
it
over
and
over
after
lighting
a
pitch
candle
about
a
finger
thick
and
the
color
of
gingerbread
this
article
of
consumption
imported
into
brittany
from
the
north
was
only
one
more
proof
to
the
eyes
in
this
strange
country
of
a
utter
ignorance
of
all
commercial
principles
even
the
commonest
after
seeing
the
green
ribbon
staring
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
scratching
his
ear
and
drinking
a
beaker
of
cider
having
first
offered
a
glass
to
the
beautiful
lady
left
her
seated
before
the
table
and
went
to
fetch
the
required
donkeys
the
violet
gleam
cast
by
the
pitch
candle
was
not
powerful
enough
to
counteract
the
fitful
moonlight
which
touched
the
dark
floor
and
furniture
of
the
cottage
with
luminous
points
the
little
boy
had
lifted
his
pretty
head
inquisitively
and
above
it
two
cows
were
poking
their
rosy
muzzles
and
brilliant
eyes
through
the
holes
in
the
stable
wall
the
big
dog
whose
countenance
was
by
no
means
the
least
intelligent
of
the
family
seemed
to
be
examining
the
strangers
with
as
much
curiosity
as
the
little
boy
a
painter
would
have
stopped
to
admire
the
night
effects
of
this
scene
but
marie
not
wishing
to
enter
into
conversation
with
barbette
who
sat
up
in
bed
and
began
to
show
signs
of
amazement
at
recognizing
her
left
the
hovel
to
escape
its
fetid
air
and
the
questions
of
its
mistress
she
ran
quickly
up
the
stone
staircase
behind
the
cottage
admiring
the
vast
details
of
the
landscape
the
aspect
of
which
underwent
as
many
changes
as
spectators
made
steps
either
upward
to
the
summits
or
downward
to
the
valleys
the
moonlight
was
now
enveloping
like
a
luminous
mist
the
valley
of
couesnon
certainly
a
woman
whose
heart
was
burdened
with
a
despised
love
would
be
sensitive
to
the
melancholy
which
that
soft
brilliancy
inspires
in
the
soul
by
the
weird
appearance
it
gives
to
objects
and
the
colors
with
which
it
tints
the
streams
the
silence
was
presently
broken
by
the
braying
of
a
donkey
marie
went
quickly
back
to
the
hut
and
the
party
started
armed
with
a
gun
wore
a
long
goatskin
which
gave
him
something
the
look
of
robinson
crusoe
his
blotched
face
seamed
with
wrinkles
was
scarcely
visible
under
the
hat
which
the
breton
peasants
still
retain
as
a
tradition
of
the
olden
time
proud
to
have
won
after
their
servitude
the
right
to
wear
the
former
ornament
of
seignorial
heads
this
nocturnal
caravan
protected
by
a
guide
whose
clothing
attitudes
and
person
had
something
patriarchal
about
them
bore
no
little
resemblance
to
the
flight
into
egypt
as
we
see
it
represented
by
the
sombre
brush
of
rembrandt
carefully
avoided
the
and
guided
the
two
women
through
the
labyrinth
of
which
intersect
brittany
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
then
understood
the
chouan
warfare
in
threading
these
complicated
paths
she
could
better
appreciate
the
condition
of
a
country
which
when
she
saw
it
from
an
elevation
had
seemed
to
her
so
charming
but
into
which
it
was
necessary
to
penetrate
before
the
dangers
and
inextricable
difficulties
of
it
could
be
understood
round
each
field
and
from
time
immemorial
the
peasants
have
piled
mud
walls
about
six
feet
high
and
prismatic
in
shape
on
the
top
of
which
grow
chestnuts
oaks
and
beeches
the
walls
thus
planted
are
called
hedges
norman
hedges
and
the
long
branches
of
the
trees
sweeping
over
the
pathways
arch
them
sunken
between
these
walls
made
of
a
clay
soil
the
paths
are
like
the
covered
ways
of
a
fortification
and
where
the
granite
rock
which
in
these
regions
comes
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
does
not
make
a
sort
of
rugged
natural
pavement
they
become
so
impracticable
that
the
smallest
vehicles
can
only
be
drawn
over
them
by
two
pairs
of
oxen
or
breton
horses
which
are
small
but
usually
vigorous
these
are
so
swampy
that
have
gradually
by
long
usage
made
other
paths
beside
them
on
the
which
are
called
rotes
and
these
begin
and
end
with
each
division
into
fields
in
order
to
cross
from
one
field
to
another
it
is
necessary
to
climb
the
clay
banks
by
means
of
steps
which
are
often
very
slippery
after
a
rain
travellers
have
many
other
obstacles
to
encounter
in
these
intricate
paths
thus
surrounded
each
field
is
closed
by
what
is
called
in
the
west
an
that
is
a
trunk
or
stout
branch
of
a
tree
one
end
of
which
being
pierced
is
fitted
to
an
upright
post
which
serves
as
a
pivot
on
which
it
turns
one
end
of
the
projects
far
enough
beyond
the
pivot
to
hold
a
weight
and
this
singular
rustic
gate
the
post
of
which
rests
in
a
hole
made
in
the
bank
is
so
easy
to
work
that
a
child
can
handle
it
sometimes
the
peasants
economize
the
stone
which
forms
the
weight
by
lengthening
the
trunk
or
branch
beyond
the
pivot
this
method
of
enclosure
varies
with
the
genius
of
each
proprietor
sometimes
it
consists
of
a
single
trunk
or
branch
both
ends
of
which
are
embedded
in
the
bank
in
other
places
it
looks
like
a
gate
and
is
made
of
several
slim
branches
placed
at
regular
distances
like
the
steps
of
a
ladder
lying
horizontally
the
form
turns
like
the
on
a
pivot
these
hedges
and
give
the
region
the
appearance
of
a
huge
each
field
forming
a
square
perfectly
isolated
from
the
rest
closed
like
a
fortress
and
protected
by
ramparts
the
gate
which
is
very
easy
to
defend
is
a
dangerous
spot
for
assailants
the
breton
peasant
thinks
he
improves
his
fallow
land
by
encouraging
the
growth
of
gorse
a
shrub
so
well
treated
in
these
regions
that
it
soon
attains
the
height
of
a
man
this
delusion
worthy
of
a
population
which
puts
its
manure
on
the
highest
spot
in
the
courtyard
has
covered
the
soil
to
a
proportion
of
one
fourth
with
masses
of
gorse
in
the
midst
of
which
a
thousand
men
might
ambush
also
there
is
scarcely
a
field
without
a
number
of
old
the
fruit
being
used
for
cider
which
kill
the
vegetation
wherever
their
branches
cover
the
ground
now
if
the
reader
will
reflect
on
the
small
extent
of
open
ground
within
these
hedges
and
large
trees
whose
hungry
roots
impoverish
the
soil
he
will
have
an
idea
of
the
cultivation
and
general
character
of
the
region
through
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
now
passing
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
object
of
these
enclosures
is
to
avoid
all
disputes
of
possession
or
whether
the
custom
is
a
lazy
one
of
keeping
the
cattle
from
straying
without
the
trouble
of
watching
them
at
any
rate
such
formidable
barriers
are
permanent
obstacles
which
make
these
regions
impenetrable
and
ordinary
warfare
impossible
there
lies
the
whole
secret
of
the
chouan
war
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
saw
plainly
the
necessity
the
republic
was
under
to
strangle
the
disaffection
by
means
of
police
and
by
negotiation
rather
than
by
a
useless
employment
of
military
force
what
could
be
done
in
fact
with
a
people
wise
enough
to
despise
the
possession
of
towns
and
hold
to
that
of
an
open
country
already
furnished
with
indestructible
fortifications
surely
nothing
except
negotiate
especially
as
the
whole
active
strength
of
these
deluded
peasants
lay
in
a
single
able
and
enterprising
leader
she
admired
the
genius
of
the
minister
who
sitting
in
his
study
had
been
able
to
grasp
the
true
way
of
procuring
peace
she
thought
she
understood
the
considerations
which
act
on
the
minds
of
men
powerful
enough
to
take
a
bird
view
of
an
empire
men
whose
actions
criminal
in
the
eyes
of
the
masses
are
the
outcome
of
a
vast
and
intelligent
thought
there
is
in
these
terrible
souls
some
mysterious
blending
of
the
force
of
fate
and
that
of
destiny
some
prescience
which
suddenly
elevates
them
above
their
fellows
the
masses
seek
them
for
a
time
in
their
own
ranks
then
they
raise
their
eyes
and
see
these
lordly
souls
above
them
such
reflections
as
these
seemed
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
justify
and
even
to
ennoble
her
thoughts
of
vengeance
this
travail
of
her
soul
and
its
expectations
gave
her
vigor
enough
to
bear
the
unusual
fatigues
of
this
strange
journey
at
the
end
of
each
property
made
the
women
dismount
from
their
donkeys
and
climb
the
obstructions
then
mounting
again
they
made
their
way
through
the
boggy
paths
which
already
felt
the
approach
of
winter
the
combination
of
tall
trees
sunken
paths
and
enclosed
places
kept
the
soil
in
a
state
of
humidity
which
wrapped
the
travellers
in
a
mantle
of
ice
however
after
much
wearisome
fatigue
they
managed
to
reach
the
woods
of
marignay
by
sunrise
the
journey
then
became
less
difficult
and
led
by
a
broad
footway
through
the
forest
the
arch
formed
by
the
branches
and
the
great
size
of
the
trees
protected
the
travellers
from
the
weather
and
the
many
difficulties
of
the
first
half
of
their
way
did
not
recur
they
had
hardly
gone
a
couple
of
miles
through
the
woods
before
they
heard
a
confused
noise
of
distant
voices
and
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
the
silvery
tones
of
which
did
not
have
the
monotonous
sound
given
by
the
movements
of
cattle
listened
with
great
attention
as
he
walked
along
to
this
melody
presently
a
puff
of
wind
brought
several
chanted
words
to
his
ear
which
seemed
to
affect
him
powerfully
for
he
suddenly
turned
the
wearied
donkeys
into
a
which
led
away
from
paying
no
attention
to
the
remonstrances
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whose
fears
were
increased
by
the
darkness
of
the
forest
path
along
which
their
guide
now
led
them
to
right
and
left
were
enormous
blocks
of
granite
laid
one
upon
the
other
of
whimsical
shape
across
them
huge
roots
had
glided
like
monstrous
serpents
seeking
from
afar
the
juicy
nourishment
enjoyed
by
a
few
beeches
the
two
sides
of
the
road
resembled
the
subterranean
grottos
that
are
famous
for
stalactites
immense
festoons
of
stone
where
the
darkling
verdure
of
ivy
and
holly
allied
itself
to
the
patches
of
the
moss
and
lichen
hid
the
precipices
and
the
openings
into
several
caves
when
the
three
travellers
had
gone
a
few
steps
through
a
very
narrow
path
a
most
surprising
spectacle
suddenly
unfolded
itself
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
eyes
and
made
her
understand
the
obstinacy
of
her
chouan
guide
a
basin
of
granite
blocks
formed
an
ampitheatre
on
the
rough
tiers
of
which
rose
tall
black
pines
and
yellowing
chestnuts
one
above
the
other
like
a
vast
circus
where
the
wintry
sun
shed
its
pale
colors
rather
than
poured
its
light
and
autumn
had
spread
her
tawny
carpet
of
fallen
leaves
about
the
middle
of
this
hall
which
seemed
to
have
had
the
deluge
for
its
architect
stood
three
enormous
druid
stones
a
vast
altar
on
which
was
raised
an
old
about
a
hundred
men
kneeling
with
bared
heads
were
praying
fervently
in
this
natural
enclosure
where
a
priest
assisted
by
two
other
ecclesiastics
was
saying
mass
the
poverty
of
the
sacerdotal
vestments
the
feeble
voice
of
the
priest
which
echoed
like
a
murmur
through
the
open
space
the
praying
men
filled
with
conviction
and
united
by
one
and
the
same
sentiment
the
bare
cross
the
wild
and
barren
temple
the
dawning
day
gave
the
primitive
character
of
the
earlier
times
of
christianity
to
the
scene
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
struck
with
admiration
this
mass
said
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
this
worship
driven
back
by
persecution
to
its
sources
the
poesy
of
ancient
times
revived
in
the
midst
of
this
weird
and
romantic
nature
these
armed
and
unarmed
chouans
cruel
and
praying
men
yet
children
all
these
things
resembled
nothing
that
she
had
ever
seen
or
yet
imagined
she
remembered
admiring
in
her
childhood
the
pomps
of
the
roman
church
so
pleasing
to
the
senses
but
she
knew
nothing
of
god
his
cross
on
the
altar
his
altar
the
earth
in
place
of
the
carved
foliage
of
a
gothic
cathedral
the
autumnal
trees
upheld
the
sky
instead
of
a
thousand
colors
thrown
through
stained
glass
windows
the
sun
could
barely
slide
its
ruddy
rays
and
dull
reflections
on
altar
priest
and
people
the
men
present
were
a
fact
a
reality
and
not
a
system
it
was
a
prayer
not
a
religion
but
human
passions
the
momentary
repression
of
which
gave
harmony
to
the
picture
soon
reappeared
on
this
mysterious
scene
and
gave
it
powerful
vitality
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
reached
the
spot
the
reading
of
the
gospel
was
just
over
she
recognized
in
the
officiating
priest
not
without
fear
the
abbe
gudin
and
she
hastily
slipped
behind
a
granite
block
drawing
francine
after
her
she
was
however
unable
to
move
from
the
place
he
had
chosen
and
from
which
he
intended
to
share
in
the
benefits
of
the
ceremony
but
she
noticed
the
nature
of
the
ground
around
her
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
evade
the
danger
by
getting
away
when
the
service
was
over
before
the
priests
through
a
large
fissure
of
the
rock
that
hid
her
she
saw
the
abbe
gudin
mounting
a
block
of
granite
which
served
him
as
a
pulpit
where
he
began
his
sermon
with
the
words
nomine
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
all
present
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
my
dear
friends
continued
the
abbe
let
us
pray
in
the
first
place
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
jean
cochegrue
nicalos
laferte
joseph
brouet
francois
parquoi
sulpice
coupiau
all
of
this
parish
and
dead
of
wounds
received
in
the
fight
on
mont
pelerine
and
at
the
siege
of
fougeres
etc
the
psalm
was
recited
according
to
custom
by
the
congregation
and
the
priests
taking
verses
alternately
with
a
fervor
which
augured
well
for
the
success
of
the
sermon
when
it
was
over
the
abbe
continued
in
a
voice
which
became
gradually
louder
and
louder
for
the
former
jesuit
was
not
unaware
that
vehemence
of
delivery
was
in
itself
a
powerful
argument
with
which
to
persuade
his
hearers
these
defenders
of
our
god
christians
have
set
you
an
example
of
duty
he
said
are
you
not
ashamed
of
what
will
be
said
of
you
in
paradise
if
it
were
not
for
these
blessed
ones
who
have
just
been
received
with
open
arms
by
all
the
saints
our
lord
might
have
thought
that
your
parish
is
inhabited
by
mahometans
do
you
know
men
what
is
said
of
you
in
brittany
and
in
the
king
s
presence
what
you
don
t
know
then
i
shall
tell
you
they
say
behold
the
blues
have
cast
down
altars
and
killed
priests
and
murdered
the
king
and
queen
they
mean
to
make
the
parish
folk
of
brittany
blues
like
themselves
and
send
them
to
fight
in
foreign
lands
away
from
their
churches
where
they
run
the
risk
of
dying
without
confession
and
going
eternally
to
hell
and
yet
the
gars
of
marignay
whose
churches
they
have
burned
stand
still
with
folded
arms
oh
oh
this
republic
of
damned
souls
has
sold
the
property
of
god
and
that
of
the
nobles
at
auction
it
has
shared
the
proceeds
with
the
blues
it
has
decreed
in
order
to
gorge
itself
with
money
as
it
does
with
blood
that
a
crown
shall
be
only
worth
three
francs
instead
of
six
and
yet
the
gars
of
marignay
haven
t
seized
their
weapons
and
driven
the
blues
from
brittany
ha
paradise
will
be
closed
to
them
they
can
never
save
their
souls
that
s
what
they
say
of
you
in
the
king
s
presence
it
is
your
own
salvation
christians
which
is
at
stake
your
souls
are
to
be
saved
by
fighting
for
religion
and
the
king
saint
anne
of
auray
herself
appeared
to
me
yesterday
at
two
o
clock
and
she
said
to
me
these
very
words
which
i
now
repeat
to
you
are
you
a
priest
of
marignay
yes
madame
ready
to
serve
i
am
saint
anne
of
auray
aunt
of
god
after
the
manner
of
brittany
i
have
come
to
bid
you
warn
the
people
of
marignay
that
they
must
not
hope
for
salvation
if
they
do
not
take
arms
you
are
to
refuse
them
absolution
for
their
sins
unless
they
serve
god
bless
their
guns
and
those
who
gain
absolution
will
never
miss
the
blues
because
their
guns
are
she
disappeared
leaving
an
odor
of
incense
behind
her
i
marked
the
spot
it
is
under
the
oak
of
the
patte
d
oie
just
where
that
beautiful
wooden
virgin
was
placed
by
the
rector
of
to
whom
the
crippled
mother
of
pierre
leroi
otherwise
called
came
to
pray
and
was
cured
of
all
her
pains
because
of
her
son
s
good
deeds
you
see
her
there
in
the
midst
of
you
and
you
know
that
she
walks
without
assistance
it
was
a
miracle
a
miracle
intended
like
the
resurrection
of
marie
lambrequin
to
prove
to
you
that
god
will
never
forsake
the
breton
cause
so
long
as
the
people
fight
for
his
servants
and
for
the
king
therefore
my
dear
brothers
if
you
wish
to
save
your
souls
and
show
yourselves
defenders
of
god
and
the
king
you
will
obey
all
the
orders
of
the
man
whom
god
has
sent
to
us
and
whom
we
call
the
gars
then
indeed
you
will
no
longer
be
mahometans
you
will
rank
with
all
the
gars
of
brittany
under
the
flag
of
god
you
can
take
from
the
pockets
of
the
blues
the
money
they
have
stolen
from
you
for
if
the
fields
have
to
go
uncultivated
while
you
are
making
war
god
and
the
king
will
deliver
to
you
the
spoils
of
your
enemies
shall
it
be
said
christians
that
the
gars
of
marignay
are
behind
the
gars
of
the
morbihan
the
gars
of
of
vitre
or
antrain
who
are
all
faithful
to
god
and
the
king
will
you
let
them
get
all
the
spoils
will
you
stand
like
heretics
with
your
arms
folded
when
other
bretons
are
saving
their
souls
and
saving
their
king
forsake
all
and
follow
me
says
the
gospel
have
we
not
forsaken
our
tithes
we
priests
and
you
i
say
to
you
forsake
all
for
this
holy
war
you
shall
be
like
the
maccabees
all
will
be
forgiven
you
you
will
find
the
priests
and
curates
in
your
midst
and
you
will
conquer
pay
attention
to
these
words
christians
he
said
as
he
ended
for
this
day
only
have
we
the
power
to
bless
your
guns
those
who
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
saint
s
favor
will
not
find
her
merciful
she
will
not
forgive
them
or
listen
to
them
as
she
did
in
the
last
this
appeal
enforced
by
the
power
of
a
loud
voice
and
by
many
gestures
the
vehemence
of
which
bathed
the
orator
in
perspiration
produced
apparently
very
little
effect
the
peasants
stood
motionless
their
eyes
on
the
speaker
like
statues
but
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
presently
noticed
that
this
universal
attitude
was
the
result
of
a
spell
cast
by
the
abbe
on
the
crowd
he
had
like
great
actors
held
his
audience
as
one
man
by
addressing
their
passions
and
he
had
absolved
excesses
before
committal
and
broken
the
only
bonds
which
held
these
boorish
men
to
the
practice
of
religious
and
social
precepts
he
had
prostituted
his
sacred
office
to
political
interests
but
it
must
be
said
that
in
these
times
of
revolution
every
man
made
a
weapon
of
whatever
he
possessed
for
the
benefit
of
his
party
and
the
pacific
cross
of
jesus
became
as
much
an
instrument
of
war
as
the
peasant
s
seeing
no
one
with
whom
to
advise
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
turned
to
look
for
francine
and
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
see
that
she
shared
in
the
rapt
enthusiasm
and
was
devoutly
saying
her
chaplet
over
some
beads
which
had
probably
given
her
during
the
sermon
francine
she
said
in
a
low
voice
are
you
afraid
of
being
a
mahometan
oh
mademoiselle
replied
the
girl
just
see
pierre
s
mother
she
is
walking
francine
s
whole
attitude
showed
such
deep
conviction
that
marie
understood
at
once
the
secret
of
the
homily
the
influence
of
the
clergy
over
the
rural
masses
and
the
tremendous
effect
of
the
scene
which
was
now
beginning
the
peasants
advanced
one
by
one
and
knelt
down
presenting
their
guns
to
the
preacher
who
laid
them
upon
the
altar
offered
his
old
the
three
priests
sang
the
hymn
veni
creator
while
the
celebrant
wrapped
the
instruments
of
death
in
bluish
clouds
of
incense
waving
the
smoke
into
shapes
that
appeared
to
interlace
one
another
when
the
breeze
had
dispersed
the
vapor
the
guns
were
returned
in
due
order
each
man
received
his
own
on
his
knees
from
the
hands
of
the
priests
who
recited
a
latin
prayer
as
they
returned
them
after
the
men
had
regained
their
places
the
profound
enthusiasm
of
the
congregation
mute
till
then
broke
forth
and
resounded
in
a
formidable
manner
salvum
fac
was
the
prayer
which
the
preacher
intoned
in
an
echoing
voice
and
was
then
sung
vehemently
by
the
people
the
cry
had
something
savage
and
warlike
in
it
the
two
notes
of
the
word
readily
interpreted
by
the
peasants
were
taken
with
such
energy
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
thoughts
reverted
almost
tenderly
to
the
exiled
bourbon
family
these
recollections
awakened
those
of
her
past
life
her
memory
revived
the
fetes
of
a
court
now
dispersed
in
which
she
had
once
a
share
the
face
of
the
marquis
entered
her
reverie
with
the
natural
mobility
of
a
woman
s
mind
she
forgot
the
scene
before
her
and
reverted
to
her
plans
of
vengeance
which
might
cost
her
her
life
or
come
to
nought
under
the
influence
of
a
look
seeing
a
branch
of
holly
the
trivial
thought
crossed
her
mind
that
in
this
decisive
moment
when
she
wished
to
appear
in
all
her
beauty
at
the
ball
she
had
no
decoration
for
her
hair
and
she
gathered
a
tuft
of
the
prickly
leaves
and
shining
berries
with
the
idea
of
wearing
them
ho
ho
my
gun
may
miss
fire
on
a
duck
but
on
a
blue
never
cried
nodding
his
head
in
sign
of
satisfaction
marie
examined
her
guide
s
face
attentively
and
found
it
of
the
type
of
those
she
had
just
seen
the
old
chouan
had
evidently
no
more
ideas
than
a
child
a
naive
joy
wrinkled
his
cheeks
and
forehead
as
he
looked
at
his
gun
but
a
pious
conviction
cast
upon
that
expression
of
his
joy
a
tinge
of
fanaticism
which
brought
into
his
face
for
an
instant
the
signs
of
the
vices
of
civilization
presently
they
reached
a
village
or
rather
a
collection
of
huts
like
that
of
where
the
rest
of
the
congregation
arrived
before
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
finished
the
milk
and
bread
and
butter
which
formed
the
meal
this
irregular
company
was
led
by
the
abbe
who
held
in
his
hand
a
rough
cross
draped
with
a
flag
followed
by
a
gars
who
was
proudly
carrying
the
parish
banner
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
compelled
to
mingle
with
this
detachment
which
was
on
its
way
like
herself
to
and
would
naturally
protect
her
from
all
danger
as
soon
as
informed
them
that
the
gars
glove
was
in
her
possession
provided
always
that
the
abbe
did
not
see
her
towards
sunset
the
three
travellers
arrived
safely
at
a
little
town
which
owes
its
name
to
the
english
by
whom
it
was
built
in
the
fourteenth
century
during
their
occupation
of
brittany
before
entering
it
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
witness
of
a
strange
scene
of
this
strange
war
to
which
however
she
gave
little
attention
she
feared
to
be
recognized
by
some
of
her
enemies
and
this
dread
hastened
her
steps
five
or
six
thousand
peasants
were
camping
in
a
field
their
clothing
was
not
in
any
degree
warlike
in
fact
this
tumultuous
assembly
resembled
that
of
a
great
fair
some
attention
was
needed
to
even
observe
that
these
bretons
were
armed
for
their
goatskins
were
so
made
as
to
hide
their
guns
and
the
weapons
that
were
chiefly
visible
were
the
scythes
with
which
some
of
the
men
had
armed
themselves
while
awaiting
the
distribution
of
muskets
some
were
eating
and
drinking
others
were
fighting
and
quarrelling
in
loud
tones
but
the
greater
part
were
sleeping
on
the
ground
an
officer
in
a
red
uniform
attracted
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
attention
and
she
supposed
him
to
belong
to
the
english
service
at
a
little
distance
two
other
officers
seemed
to
be
trying
to
teach
a
few
chouans
more
intelligent
than
the
rest
to
handle
two
cannon
which
apparently
formed
the
whole
artillery
of
the
royalist
army
shouts
hailed
the
coming
of
the
gars
of
marignay
who
were
recognized
by
their
banner
under
cover
of
the
tumult
which
the
and
the
priests
excited
in
the
camp
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
able
to
make
her
way
past
it
and
into
the
town
without
danger
she
stopped
at
a
inn
not
far
from
the
building
where
the
ball
was
to
be
given
the
town
was
so
full
of
strangers
that
she
could
only
obtain
one
miserable
room
when
she
was
safely
in
it
brought
francine
the
box
which
contained
the
ball
dress
and
having
done
so
he
stood
in
an
attitude
of
indescribable
irresolution
at
any
other
time
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
would
have
been
much
amused
to
see
what
a
breton
peasant
can
be
like
when
he
leaves
his
native
parish
but
now
she
broke
the
charm
by
opening
her
purse
and
producing
four
crowns
of
six
francs
each
which
she
gave
him
take
it
she
said
and
if
you
wish
to
oblige
me
you
will
go
straight
back
to
fougeres
without
entering
the
camp
or
drinking
any
the
chouan
amazed
at
her
liberality
looked
first
at
the
crowns
which
he
had
taken
and
then
at
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
but
she
made
him
a
sign
with
her
hand
and
he
disappeared
how
could
you
send
him
away
mademoiselle
said
francine
don
t
you
see
how
the
place
is
surrounded
we
shall
never
get
away
and
who
will
protect
you
here
you
have
a
protector
of
your
own
said
marie
maliciously
giving
in
an
undertone
s
owl
cry
which
she
was
constantly
practising
francine
colored
and
smiled
rather
sadly
at
her
mistress
s
gaiety
but
who
is
yours
she
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
plucked
out
her
dagger
and
showed
it
to
the
frightened
girl
who
dropped
on
a
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
what
have
you
come
here
for
marie
she
cried
in
a
supplicating
voice
which
asked
no
answer
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
busily
twisting
the
branches
of
holly
which
she
had
gathered
i
don
t
know
whether
this
holly
will
be
becoming
she
said
a
brilliant
skin
like
mine
may
possibly
bear
a
dark
wreath
of
this
kind
what
do
you
think
francine
several
remarks
of
the
same
kind
as
she
dressed
for
the
ball
showed
the
absolute
and
coolness
of
this
strange
woman
whoever
had
listened
to
her
then
would
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
in
the
gravity
of
a
situation
in
which
she
was
risking
her
life
an
indian
muslin
gown
rather
short
and
clinging
like
damp
linen
revealed
the
delicate
outlines
of
her
shape
over
this
she
wore
a
red
drapery
numerous
folds
of
which
gradually
lengthening
as
they
fell
by
her
side
took
the
graceful
curves
of
a
greek
peplum
this
voluptuous
garment
of
the
pagan
priestesses
lessened
the
indecency
of
the
rest
of
the
attire
which
the
fashions
of
the
time
suffered
women
to
wear
to
soften
its
immodesty
still
further
marie
threw
a
gauze
scarf
over
her
shoulders
left
bare
and
far
too
low
by
the
red
drapery
she
wound
the
long
braids
of
her
hair
into
the
flat
irregular
cone
above
the
nape
of
the
neck
which
gives
such
grace
to
certain
antique
statues
by
an
artistic
elongation
of
the
head
while
a
few
stray
locks
escaping
from
her
forehead
fell
in
shining
curls
beside
her
cheeks
with
a
form
and
head
thus
dressed
she
presented
a
perfect
likeness
of
the
noble
masterpieces
of
greek
sculpture
she
smiled
as
she
looked
with
approval
at
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
which
brought
out
the
beauties
of
her
face
while
the
scarlet
berries
of
the
holly
wreath
which
she
laid
upon
it
repeated
charmingly
the
color
of
the
peplum
as
she
twisted
and
turned
a
few
leaves
to
give
capricious
diversity
to
their
arrangement
she
examined
her
whole
costume
in
a
mirror
to
judge
of
its
general
effect
i
am
horrible
she
said
as
though
she
were
surrounded
by
flatterers
i
look
like
a
statue
of
she
placed
the
dagger
carefully
in
her
bosom
leaving
the
rubies
in
the
hilt
exposed
their
ruddy
reflections
attracting
the
eye
to
the
hidden
beauties
of
her
shape
francine
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
her
mistress
when
marie
was
ready
she
made
various
pretexts
to
follow
her
she
must
help
her
to
take
off
her
mantle
and
the
overshoes
which
the
mud
and
muck
in
the
streets
compelled
her
to
wear
though
the
roads
had
been
sanded
for
this
occasion
also
the
gauze
veil
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
thrown
over
her
head
to
conceal
her
features
from
the
chouans
who
were
collecting
in
the
streets
to
watch
the
company
the
crowd
was
in
fact
so
great
that
they
were
forced
to
make
their
way
through
two
hedges
of
chouans
francine
no
longer
strove
to
detain
her
mistress
and
after
giving
a
few
last
touches
to
a
costume
the
greatest
charm
of
which
was
its
exquisite
freshness
she
stationed
herself
in
the
courtyard
that
she
might
not
abandon
this
beloved
mistress
to
her
fate
without
being
able
to
fly
to
her
succor
for
the
poor
girl
foresaw
only
evil
in
these
events
a
strange
scene
was
taking
place
in
montauran
s
chamber
as
marie
was
on
her
way
to
the
ball
the
young
marquis
who
had
just
finished
dressing
was
putting
on
the
broad
red
ribbon
which
distinguished
him
as
first
in
rank
of
the
assembly
when
the
abbe
gudin
entered
the
room
with
an
anxious
air
monsieur
le
marquis
come
quickly
he
said
you
alone
can
quell
a
tumult
which
has
broken
out
i
don
t
know
why
among
the
leaders
they
talk
of
abandoning
the
king
s
cause
i
think
that
devil
of
a
rifoel
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
such
quarrels
are
always
caused
by
some
mere
nonsense
madame
du
gua
reproached
him
so
i
hear
for
coming
to
the
ball
that
woman
must
be
crazy
cried
the
marquis
to
try
to
rifoel
retorted
continued
the
abbe
interrupting
his
chief
that
if
you
had
given
him
the
money
promised
him
in
the
king
s
name
enough
enough
i
understand
it
all
now
this
scene
has
all
been
arranged
and
you
are
put
forward
as
ambassador
i
monsieur
le
marquis
said
the
abbe
again
interrupting
him
i
am
supporting
you
vigorously
and
you
will
i
hope
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
the
restoration
of
our
altars
in
france
and
that
of
the
king
upon
the
throne
of
his
fathers
are
far
more
powerful
incentives
to
my
humble
labors
than
the
bishopric
of
rennes
which
you
the
abbe
dared
say
no
more
for
the
marquis
smiled
bitterly
at
his
last
words
however
the
young
chief
instantly
repressed
all
expression
of
feeling
his
brow
grew
stern
and
he
followed
the
abbe
gudin
into
a
hall
where
the
worst
of
the
clamor
was
echoing
i
recognize
no
authority
here
rifoel
was
saying
casting
angry
looks
at
all
about
him
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sabre
do
you
recognize
that
of
asked
the
marquis
coldly
the
young
chevalier
de
vissard
better
known
under
his
patronymic
of
rifoel
was
silent
before
the
general
of
the
catholic
armies
what
is
all
this
about
gentlemen
asked
the
marquis
examining
the
faces
round
him
this
monsieur
le
marquis
said
a
famous
smuggler
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
man
of
the
people
who
long
remains
under
the
yoke
of
respect
to
a
great
lord
though
he
admits
no
barriers
after
he
has
once
jumped
them
and
regards
the
aristocrat
as
an
equal
only
he
said
and
you
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
to
hear
it
i
am
no
speaker
of
gilded
phrases
and
i
shall
say
things
plainly
i
commanded
five
hundred
men
during
the
late
war
since
we
have
taken
up
arms
again
i
have
raised
a
thousand
heads
as
hard
as
mine
for
the
service
of
the
king
it
is
now
seven
years
that
i
have
risked
my
life
in
the
good
cause
i
don
t
blame
you
but
i
say
that
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
now
to
begin
with
i
demand
that
i
be
called
monsieur
de
cottereau
i
also
demand
that
the
rank
of
colonel
shall
be
granted
me
or
i
send
in
my
adhesion
to
the
first
consul
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
le
marquis
my
men
and
i
have
a
devilishly
importunate
creditor
who
must
be
satisfied
he
s
here
he
added
striking
his
stomach
have
the
musicians
come
said
the
marquis
in
a
contemptuous
tone
turning
to
madame
du
gua
but
the
smuggler
had
dealt
boldly
with
an
important
topic
and
the
calculating
ambitious
minds
of
those
present
had
been
too
long
in
suspense
as
to
what
they
might
hope
for
from
the
king
to
allow
the
scorn
of
their
new
leader
to
put
an
end
to
the
scene
rifoel
hastily
blocked
the
way
before
montauran
and
seized
his
hand
to
oblige
him
to
remain
take
care
monsieur
le
marquis
he
said
you
are
treating
far
too
lightly
men
who
have
a
right
to
the
gratitude
of
him
whom
you
are
here
to
represent
we
know
that
his
majesty
has
sent
you
with
full
powers
to
judge
of
our
services
and
we
say
that
they
ought
to
be
recognized
and
rewarded
for
we
risk
our
heads
upon
the
scaffold
daily
i
know
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
the
rank
of
you
mean
no
monsieur
le
marquis
charette
made
me
a
colonel
the
rank
i
mention
can
not
be
denied
me
i
am
not
arguing
for
myself
i
speak
for
my
brave
whose
services
ought
to
be
recorded
your
signature
and
your
promise
will
suffice
them
for
the
present
though
he
added
in
a
low
voice
i
must
say
they
are
satisfied
with
very
little
but
he
continued
raising
his
voice
when
the
sun
rises
on
the
chateau
of
versailles
to
glorify
the
return
of
the
monarchy
after
the
faithful
have
conquered
france
for
the
king
will
they
obtain
favors
for
their
families
pensions
for
widows
and
the
restitution
of
their
confiscated
property
i
doubt
it
but
monsieur
le
marquis
we
must
have
certified
proof
of
our
services
when
that
time
comes
i
will
never
distrust
the
king
but
i
do
distrust
those
cormorants
of
ministers
and
courtiers
who
tingle
his
ears
with
talk
about
the
public
welfare
the
honor
of
france
the
interests
of
the
crown
and
other
crochets
they
will
sneer
at
a
loyal
vendean
or
a
brave
chouan
because
he
is
old
and
the
sword
he
drew
for
the
good
cause
dangles
on
his
withered
legs
palsied
with
exposure
can
you
say
that
we
are
wrong
in
feeling
thus
you
talk
well
monsieur
du
vissard
but
you
are
over
hasty
replied
the
marquis
listen
marquis
said
the
comte
de
bauvan
in
a
whisper
rifoel
has
really
on
my
word
told
the
truth
you
are
sure
yourself
to
have
the
ear
of
the
king
while
the
rest
of
us
only
see
him
at
a
distance
and
from
time
to
time
i
will
own
to
you
that
if
you
do
not
give
me
your
word
as
a
gentleman
that
i
shall
in
due
course
of
time
obtain
the
place
of
master
of
woods
and
waters
in
france
the
devil
take
me
if
i
will
risk
my
neck
any
longer
to
conquer
normandy
for
the
king
is
not
an
easy
matter
and
i
demand
the
order
for
it
but
he
added
coloring
there
s
time
enough
to
think
of
that
god
forbid
that
i
should
imitate
these
poor
mercenaries
and
harass
you
speak
to
the
king
for
me
and
that
s
each
of
the
chiefs
found
means
to
let
the
marquis
know
in
a
more
or
less
ingenious
manner
the
exaggerated
price
they
set
upon
their
services
one
modestly
demanded
the
governorship
of
brittany
another
a
barony
this
one
a
promotion
that
one
a
command
and
all
wanted
pensions
well
baron
said
the
marquis
to
monsieur
du
guenic
don
t
you
want
anything
these
gentlemen
have
left
me
nothing
but
the
crown
of
france
marquis
but
i
might
manage
to
put
up
with
that
gentlemen
cried
the
abbe
gudin
in
a
loud
voice
remember
that
if
you
are
too
eager
you
will
spoil
everything
in
the
day
of
victory
the
king
will
then
be
compelled
to
make
concessions
to
the
to
those
jacobins
shouted
the
smuggler
ha
if
the
king
would
let
me
have
my
way
i
d
answer
for
my
thousand
men
we
d
soon
wring
their
necks
and
be
rid
of
monsieur
cottereau
said
the
marquis
i
see
some
of
our
invited
guests
arriving
we
must
all
do
our
best
by
attention
and
courtesy
to
make
them
share
our
sacred
enterprise
you
will
agree
i
am
sure
that
this
is
not
the
moment
to
bring
forward
your
demands
however
just
they
may
so
saying
the
marquis
went
to
the
door
as
if
to
meet
certain
of
the
country
nobles
who
were
entering
the
room
but
the
bold
smuggler
barred
his
way
in
a
respectful
manner
no
no
monsieur
le
marquis
excuse
me
he
said
the
jacobins
taught
me
too
well
in
that
it
is
not
he
who
sows
and
reaps
who
eats
the
bread
sign
this
bit
of
paper
for
me
and
i
ll
bring
you
fifteen
hundred
gars
if
not
i
ll
treat
with
the
first
looking
haughtily
about
him
the
marquis
saw
plainly
that
the
boldness
of
the
old
partisan
and
his
resolute
air
were
not
displeasing
to
any
of
the
spectators
of
this
debate
one
man
alone
sitting
by
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
appeared
to
take
no
part
in
the
scene
and
to
be
chiefly
occupied
in
filling
his
pipe
the
contemptuous
air
with
which
he
glanced
at
the
speakers
his
modest
demeanor
and
a
look
of
sympathy
which
the
marquis
encountered
in
his
eyes
made
the
young
leader
observe
the
man
whom
he
then
recognized
as
major
brigaut
and
he
went
suddenly
up
to
him
and
you
what
do
you
want
he
said
oh
monsieur
le
marquis
if
the
king
comes
back
that
s
all
i
but
for
yourself
for
myself
are
you
joking
the
marquis
pressed
the
horny
hand
of
the
breton
and
said
to
madame
du
gua
who
was
near
them
madame
i
may
perish
in
this
enterprise
before
i
have
time
to
make
a
faithful
report
to
the
king
on
the
catholic
armies
of
brittany
i
charge
you
in
case
you
live
to
see
the
restoration
not
to
forget
this
honorable
man
nor
the
baron
du
guenic
there
is
more
devotion
in
them
than
in
all
those
other
men
put
he
pointed
to
the
chiefs
who
were
waiting
with
some
impatience
till
the
marquis
should
reply
to
their
demands
they
were
all
holding
papers
in
their
hands
on
which
no
doubt
their
services
were
recorded
over
the
signatures
of
the
various
generals
of
the
former
war
and
all
were
murmuring
the
abbe
gudin
the
comte
de
bauvan
and
the
baron
du
guenic
were
consulting
how
best
to
help
the
marquis
in
rejecting
these
extravagant
demands
for
they
felt
the
position
of
the
young
leader
to
be
extremely
delicate
suddenly
the
marquis
ran
his
blue
eyes
gleaming
with
satire
over
the
whole
assembly
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
gentlemen
i
do
not
know
whether
the
powers
which
the
king
has
graciously
assigned
to
me
are
such
that
i
am
able
to
satisfy
your
demands
he
doubtless
did
not
foresee
such
zeal
such
devotion
on
your
part
you
shall
judge
yourselves
of
the
duties
put
upon
me
duties
which
i
shall
know
how
to
so
saying
he
left
the
room
and
returned
immediately
holding
in
his
hand
an
open
letter
bearing
the
royal
seal
and
signature
these
are
the
in
virtue
of
which
you
are
to
obey
me
he
said
they
authorize
me
to
govern
the
provinces
of
brittany
normandy
maine
and
anjou
in
the
king
s
name
and
to
recognize
the
services
of
such
officers
as
may
distinguish
themselves
in
his
a
movement
of
satisfaction
ran
through
the
assembly
the
chouans
approached
the
marquis
and
made
a
respectful
circle
round
him
all
eyes
fastened
on
the
king
s
signature
the
young
chief
who
was
standing
near
the
chimney
suddenly
threw
the
letters
into
the
fire
and
they
were
burned
in
a
second
i
do
not
choose
to
command
any
cried
the
young
man
but
those
who
see
a
king
in
the
king
and
not
a
prey
to
prey
upon
you
are
free
gentlemen
to
leave
madame
du
gua
the
abbe
gudin
major
brigaut
the
chevalier
du
vissard
the
baron
du
guenic
and
the
comte
de
bauvan
raised
the
cry
of
vive
le
roi
for
a
moment
the
other
leaders
hesitated
then
carried
away
by
the
noble
action
of
the
marquis
they
begged
him
to
forget
what
had
passed
assuring
him
that
or
not
he
must
always
be
their
leader
come
and
dance
cried
the
comte
de
bauvan
and
happen
what
will
after
all
he
added
gaily
it
is
better
my
friends
to
pray
to
god
than
the
saints
let
us
fight
first
and
see
what
comes
of
ha
that
s
good
advice
said
brigaut
i
have
never
yet
known
a
day
s
pay
drawn
in
the
the
assembly
dispersed
about
the
rooms
where
the
guests
were
now
arriving
the
marquis
tried
in
vain
to
shake
off
the
gloom
which
darkened
his
face
the
chiefs
perceived
the
unfavorable
impression
made
upon
a
young
man
whose
devotion
was
still
surrounded
by
all
the
beautiful
illusions
of
youth
and
they
were
ashamed
of
their
action
however
a
joyous
gaiety
soon
enlivened
the
opening
of
the
ball
at
which
were
present
the
most
important
personages
of
the
royalist
party
who
unable
to
judge
rightly
in
the
depths
of
a
rebellious
province
of
the
actual
events
of
the
revolution
mistook
their
hopes
for
realities
the
bold
operations
already
begun
by
montauran
his
name
his
fortune
his
capacity
raised
their
courage
and
caused
that
political
intoxication
the
most
dangerous
of
all
excitements
which
does
not
cool
till
torrents
of
blood
have
been
uselessly
shed
in
the
minds
of
all
present
the
revolution
was
nothing
more
than
a
passing
trouble
to
the
kingdom
of
france
where
to
their
belated
eyes
nothing
was
changed
the
country
belonged
as
it
ever
did
to
the
house
of
bourbon
the
royalists
were
the
lords
of
the
soil
as
completely
as
they
were
four
years
earlier
when
hoche
obtained
less
a
peace
than
an
armistice
the
nobles
made
light
of
the
revolutionists
for
them
bonaparte
was
another
but
more
fortunate
marceau
so
gaiety
reigned
the
women
had
come
to
dance
a
few
only
of
the
chiefs
who
had
fought
the
blues
knew
the
gravity
of
the
situation
but
they
were
well
aware
that
if
they
talked
of
the
first
consul
and
his
power
to
their
benighted
companions
they
could
not
make
themselves
understood
these
men
stood
apart
and
looked
at
the
women
with
indifference
madame
du
gua
who
seemed
to
do
the
honors
of
the
ball
endeavored
to
quiet
the
impatience
of
the
dancers
by
dispensing
flatteries
to
each
in
turn
the
musicians
were
tuning
their
instruments
and
the
dancing
was
about
to
begin
when
madame
du
gua
noticed
the
gloom
on
de
montauran
s
face
and
went
hurriedly
up
to
him
i
hope
it
is
not
that
vulgar
scene
you
have
just
had
with
those
clodhoppers
which
depresses
you
she
said
she
got
no
answer
the
marquis
absorbed
in
thought
was
listening
in
fancy
to
the
prophetic
reasons
which
marie
had
given
him
in
the
midst
of
the
same
chiefs
at
la
vivetiere
urging
him
to
abandon
the
struggle
of
kings
against
peoples
but
the
young
man
s
soul
was
too
proud
too
lofty
too
full
perhaps
of
conviction
to
abandon
an
enterprise
he
had
once
begun
and
he
decided
at
this
moment
to
continue
it
boldly
in
the
face
of
all
obstacles
he
raised
his
head
haughtily
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
madame
du
gua
was
speaking
to
him
your
mind
is
no
doubt
at
fougeres
she
remarked
bitterly
seeing
how
useless
her
efforts
to
attract
his
attention
had
been
ah
monsieur
i
would
give
my
life
to
put
within
your
power
and
see
you
happy
with
then
why
have
you
done
all
you
could
to
kill
her
because
i
wish
her
dead
or
in
your
arms
yes
i
may
have
loved
the
marquis
de
montauran
when
i
thought
him
a
hero
but
now
i
feel
only
a
pitying
friendship
for
him
i
see
him
shorn
of
all
his
glory
by
a
fickle
love
for
a
worthless
as
for
love
said
the
marquis
in
a
sarcastic
tone
you
judge
me
wrong
if
i
loved
that
girl
madame
i
might
desire
her
less
if
it
were
not
for
you
perhaps
i
should
not
think
of
her
at
here
she
is
exclaimed
madame
du
gua
abruptly
the
haste
with
which
the
marquis
looked
round
went
to
the
heart
of
the
woman
but
the
clear
light
of
the
wax
candles
enabled
her
to
see
every
change
on
the
face
of
the
man
she
loved
so
violently
and
when
he
turned
back
his
face
smiling
at
her
woman
s
trick
she
fancied
there
was
still
some
hope
of
recovering
him
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
the
comte
de
bauvan
at
a
which
has
burst
interposed
madame
du
gua
gaily
the
marquis
if
we
are
now
to
believe
him
is
astonished
that
his
heart
ever
beat
the
faster
for
that
girl
who
presumes
to
call
herself
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
you
know
who
i
that
girl
echoed
the
count
madame
the
author
of
a
wrong
is
bound
to
repair
it
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
she
is
really
the
daughter
of
the
duc
de
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
marquis
in
a
changed
voice
which
of
your
statements
am
i
to
believe
that
of
la
vivetiere
or
that
now
made
the
loud
voice
of
a
servant
at
the
door
announced
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
count
sprang
forward
instantly
offered
his
hand
to
the
beautiful
woman
with
every
mark
of
profound
respect
and
led
her
through
the
inquisitive
crowd
to
the
marquis
and
madame
du
gua
believe
the
one
now
made
he
replied
to
the
astonished
young
leader
madame
du
gua
turned
pale
at
the
unwelcome
sight
of
the
girl
who
stood
for
a
moment
glancing
proudly
over
the
assembled
company
among
whom
she
sought
to
find
the
guests
at
la
vivetiere
she
awaited
the
forced
salutation
of
her
rival
and
without
even
looking
at
the
marquis
she
allowed
the
count
to
lead
her
to
the
place
of
honor
beside
madame
du
gua
whose
bow
she
returned
with
an
air
that
was
slightly
protecting
but
the
latter
with
a
woman
s
instinct
took
no
offense
on
the
contrary
she
immediately
assumed
a
smiling
friendly
manner
the
extraordinary
dress
and
beauty
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
caused
a
murmur
throughout
the
ballroom
when
the
marquis
and
madame
du
gua
looked
towards
the
late
guests
at
la
vivetiere
they
saw
them
in
an
attitude
of
respectful
admiration
which
was
not
assumed
each
seemed
desirous
of
recovering
favor
with
the
misjudged
young
woman
the
enemies
were
in
presence
of
each
other
this
is
really
magic
mademoiselle
said
madame
du
gua
there
is
no
one
like
you
for
surprises
have
you
come
all
alone
all
alone
replied
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
so
you
have
only
one
to
kill
be
merciful
said
madame
du
gua
i
can
not
express
to
you
the
pleasure
i
have
in
seeing
you
again
i
have
truly
been
overwhelmed
by
the
remembrance
of
the
wrongs
i
have
done
you
and
am
most
anxious
for
an
occasion
to
repair
as
for
those
wrongs
madame
i
readily
pardon
those
you
did
to
me
but
my
heart
bleeds
for
the
blues
whom
you
murdered
however
i
excuse
all
in
return
for
the
service
you
have
done
madame
du
gua
lost
countenance
as
she
felt
her
hand
pressed
by
her
beautiful
rival
with
insulting
courtesy
the
marquis
had
hitherto
stood
motionless
but
he
now
seized
the
arm
of
the
count
you
have
shamefully
misled
me
he
said
you
have
compromised
my
honor
i
am
not
a
geronte
of
comedy
and
i
shall
have
your
life
or
you
will
have
marquis
said
the
count
haughtily
i
am
ready
to
give
you
all
the
explanations
you
they
passed
into
the
next
room
the
witnesses
of
this
scene
even
those
least
initiated
into
the
secret
began
to
understand
its
nature
so
that
when
the
musicians
gave
the
signal
for
the
dancing
to
begin
no
one
moved
mademoiselle
what
service
have
i
rendered
you
that
deserves
a
return
said
madame
du
gua
biting
her
lips
in
a
sort
of
rage
did
you
not
enlighten
me
as
to
the
true
character
of
the
marquis
de
montauran
madame
with
what
utter
indifference
that
man
allowed
me
to
go
to
my
death
i
give
him
up
to
you
willingly
then
why
are
you
here
asked
madame
du
gua
eagerly
to
recover
the
respect
and
consideration
you
took
from
me
at
la
vivetiere
madame
as
for
all
the
rest
make
yourself
easy
even
if
the
marquis
returned
to
me
you
know
very
well
that
a
return
is
never
madame
du
gua
took
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
hand
with
that
affectionate
touch
and
motion
which
women
practise
to
each
other
especially
in
the
presence
of
men
well
my
poor
dear
child
she
said
i
am
glad
to
find
you
so
reasonable
if
the
service
i
did
you
was
rather
harsh
she
added
pressing
the
hand
she
held
and
feeling
a
desire
to
rend
it
as
her
fingers
felt
its
softness
and
delicacy
it
shall
at
least
be
thorough
listen
to
me
i
know
the
character
of
the
gars
he
meant
to
deceive
you
he
neither
can
nor
will
marry
any
woman
except
ah
yes
mademoiselle
he
has
accepted
his
dangerous
mission
to
win
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
d
uxelles
a
marriage
to
which
his
majesty
has
promised
his
ah
ah
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
added
not
a
word
to
that
scornful
ejaculation
the
young
and
handsome
chevalier
du
vissard
eager
to
be
forgiven
for
the
joke
which
had
led
to
the
insults
at
la
vivetiere
now
came
up
to
her
and
respectfully
invited
her
to
dance
she
placed
her
hand
in
his
and
they
took
their
places
in
a
quadrille
opposite
to
madame
du
gua
the
gowns
of
the
royalist
women
which
recalled
the
fashions
of
the
exiled
court
and
their
creped
and
powdered
hair
seemed
absurd
as
soon
as
they
were
contrasted
with
the
attire
which
republican
fashions
authorized
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
to
wear
this
attire
which
was
elegant
rich
and
yet
severe
was
loudly
condemned
but
inwardly
envied
by
all
the
women
present
the
men
could
not
restrain
their
admiration
for
the
beauty
of
her
natural
hair
and
the
adjustment
of
a
dress
the
charm
of
which
was
in
the
proportions
of
the
form
which
it
revealed
at
that
moment
the
marquis
and
the
count
the
ballroom
behind
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
did
not
turn
her
head
if
a
mirror
had
not
been
there
to
inform
her
of
montauran
s
presence
she
would
have
known
it
from
madame
du
gua
s
face
which
scarcely
concealed
under
an
apparently
indifferent
air
the
impatience
with
which
she
awaited
the
conflict
which
must
sooner
or
later
take
place
between
the
lovers
though
the
marquis
talked
with
the
count
and
other
persons
he
heard
the
remarks
of
all
the
dancers
who
from
time
to
time
in
the
mazes
of
the
quadrille
took
the
place
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
her
partner
positively
madame
she
came
alone
said
one
she
must
be
a
bold
woman
replied
the
lady
if
i
were
dressed
like
that
i
should
feel
myself
naked
said
another
woman
oh
the
gown
is
not
decent
certainly
replied
her
partner
but
it
is
so
becoming
and
she
is
so
i
am
ashamed
to
look
at
such
perfect
dancing
for
her
sake
isn
t
it
exactly
that
of
an
opera
girl
said
the
envious
woman
do
you
suppose
that
she
has
come
here
to
intrigue
for
the
first
consul
said
another
a
joke
if
she
has
replied
the
partner
well
she
can
t
offer
innocence
as
a
dowry
said
the
lady
laughing
the
gars
turned
abruptly
to
see
the
lady
who
uttered
this
sarcasm
and
madame
du
gua
looked
at
him
as
if
to
say
you
see
what
people
think
of
madame
said
the
count
laughing
so
far
it
is
only
women
who
have
taken
her
innocence
away
from
the
marquis
privately
forgave
the
count
when
he
ventured
to
look
at
his
mistress
whose
beauty
was
like
that
of
most
women
brought
into
relief
by
the
light
of
the
wax
candles
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
as
she
resumed
her
place
and
went
on
talking
to
her
partner
in
a
way
to
let
the
marquis
hear
the
sweetest
and
most
caressing
tones
of
her
voice
the
first
consul
sends
dangerous
ambassadors
her
partner
was
saying
monsieur
she
replied
you
all
said
that
at
la
you
have
the
memory
of
a
king
replied
he
disconcerted
at
his
own
awkwardness
to
forgive
injuries
one
must
needs
remember
them
she
said
quickly
relieving
his
embarrassment
with
a
smile
are
we
all
included
in
that
amnesty
said
the
marquis
approaching
her
but
she
darted
away
in
the
dance
with
the
gaiety
of
a
child
leaving
him
without
an
answer
he
watched
her
coldly
and
sadly
she
saw
it
and
bent
her
head
with
one
of
those
coquettish
motions
which
the
graceful
lines
of
her
throat
enabled
her
to
make
omitting
no
movement
or
attitude
which
could
prove
to
him
the
perfection
of
her
figure
she
attracted
him
like
hope
and
eluded
him
like
a
memory
to
see
her
thus
was
to
desire
to
possess
her
at
any
cost
she
knew
that
and
the
sense
it
gave
her
of
her
own
beauty
shed
upon
her
whole
person
an
inexpressible
charm
the
marquis
felt
the
storm
of
love
of
rage
of
madness
rising
in
his
heart
he
wrung
the
count
s
hand
violently
and
left
the
room
is
he
gone
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
returning
to
her
place
the
count
gave
her
a
glance
and
passed
into
the
next
room
from
which
he
presently
returned
accompanied
by
the
gars
he
is
mine
she
thought
observing
his
face
in
the
mirror
she
received
the
young
leader
with
a
displeased
air
and
said
nothing
but
she
smiled
as
she
turned
away
from
him
he
was
so
superior
to
all
about
him
that
she
was
proud
of
being
able
to
rule
him
and
obeying
an
instinct
which
sways
all
women
more
or
less
she
resolved
to
let
him
know
the
value
of
a
few
gracious
words
by
making
him
pay
dear
for
them
as
soon
as
the
quadrille
was
over
all
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
at
la
vivetiere
surrounded
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
wishing
by
their
flattering
attentions
to
obtain
her
pardon
for
the
mistake
they
had
made
but
he
whom
she
longed
to
see
at
her
feet
did
not
approach
the
circle
over
which
she
now
reigned
a
queen
he
thinks
i
still
love
him
she
thought
and
does
not
wish
to
be
confounded
with
mere
she
refused
to
dance
again
then
as
if
the
ball
were
given
for
her
she
walked
about
on
the
arm
of
the
comte
de
bauvan
to
whom
she
was
pleased
to
show
some
familiarity
the
affair
at
la
vivetiere
was
by
this
time
known
to
all
present
thanks
to
madame
du
gua
and
the
lovers
were
the
object
of
general
attention
the
marquis
dared
not
again
address
his
mistress
a
sense
of
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
and
the
violence
of
his
returning
passion
made
her
seem
to
him
actually
terrible
on
her
side
marie
watched
his
apparently
calm
face
while
she
seemed
to
be
observing
the
ball
it
is
fearfully
hot
here
she
said
to
the
count
take
me
to
the
other
side
where
i
can
breathe
i
am
stifling
and
she
motioned
towards
a
small
room
where
a
few
were
assembled
the
marquis
followed
her
he
ventured
to
hope
she
had
left
the
crowd
to
receive
him
and
this
supposed
favor
roused
his
passion
to
extreme
violence
for
his
love
had
only
increased
through
the
resistance
he
had
made
to
it
during
the
last
few
days
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
still
tormented
him
her
eyes
so
soft
and
velvety
for
the
count
were
hard
and
stern
when
as
if
by
accident
they
met
his
montauran
at
last
made
a
painful
effort
and
said
in
a
muffled
voice
will
you
never
forgive
me
love
forgives
nothing
or
it
forgives
all
she
said
coldly
but
she
added
noticing
his
joyful
look
it
must
be
she
took
the
count
s
arm
once
more
and
moved
forward
into
a
small
boudoir
which
adjoined
the
cardroom
the
marquis
followed
her
will
you
not
hear
me
he
said
one
would
really
think
monsieur
she
replied
that
i
had
come
here
to
meet
you
and
not
to
vindicate
my
own
if
you
do
not
cease
this
odious
pursuit
i
shall
leave
the
ah
he
cried
recollecting
one
of
the
crazy
actions
of
the
last
duc
de
lorraine
let
me
speak
to
you
so
long
as
i
can
hold
this
live
coal
in
my
he
stooped
to
the
hearth
and
picking
up
a
brand
held
it
tightly
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
flushed
took
her
arm
from
that
of
the
count
and
looked
at
the
marquis
in
amazement
the
count
softly
withdrew
leaving
them
alone
together
so
crazy
an
action
shook
marie
s
heart
for
there
is
nothing
so
persuasive
in
love
as
courageous
folly
you
only
prove
to
me
she
said
trying
to
make
him
throw
away
the
brand
that
you
are
willing
to
make
me
suffer
cruelly
you
are
extreme
in
everything
on
the
word
of
a
fool
and
the
slander
of
a
woman
you
suspected
that
one
who
had
just
saved
your
life
was
capable
of
betraying
yes
he
said
smiling
i
have
been
very
cruel
to
you
but
nevertheless
forget
it
i
shall
never
forget
it
hear
me
i
have
been
shamefully
deceived
but
so
many
circumstances
on
that
fatal
day
told
against
you
and
those
circumstances
were
stronger
than
your
love
he
hesitated
she
made
a
motion
of
contempt
and
rose
oh
marie
i
shall
never
cease
to
believe
in
you
then
throw
that
fire
away
you
are
mad
open
your
hand
i
insist
upon
he
took
delight
in
still
resisting
the
soft
efforts
of
her
fingers
but
she
succeeded
in
opening
the
hand
she
would
fain
have
kissed
what
good
did
that
do
you
she
said
as
she
tore
her
handkerchief
and
laid
it
on
the
burn
which
the
marquis
covered
with
his
glove
madame
du
gua
had
stolen
softly
into
the
cardroom
watching
the
lovers
with
furtive
eyes
but
escaping
theirs
adroitly
it
was
however
impossible
for
her
to
understand
their
conversation
from
their
actions
if
all
that
they
said
of
me
was
true
you
must
admit
that
i
am
avenged
at
this
moment
said
marie
with
a
look
of
malignity
which
startled
the
marquis
what
feeling
brought
you
here
he
asked
do
you
suppose
my
dear
friend
that
you
can
despise
a
woman
like
me
with
impunity
i
came
here
for
your
sake
and
for
my
own
she
continued
after
a
pause
laying
her
hand
on
the
hilt
of
rubies
in
her
bosom
and
showing
him
the
blade
of
her
dagger
what
does
all
that
mean
thought
madame
du
gua
but
she
continued
you
still
love
me
at
any
rate
you
desire
me
and
the
folly
you
have
just
committed
she
added
taking
his
hand
proves
it
to
me
i
will
again
be
that
i
desired
to
be
and
i
return
to
fougeres
happy
love
absolves
everything
you
love
me
i
have
regained
the
respect
of
the
man
who
represents
to
me
the
whole
world
and
i
can
then
you
still
love
me
said
the
marquis
have
i
said
so
she
replied
with
a
scornful
look
delighting
in
the
torture
she
was
making
him
endure
i
have
run
many
risks
to
come
here
i
have
saved
monsieur
de
bauvan
s
life
and
he
more
grateful
than
others
offers
me
in
return
his
fortune
and
his
name
you
have
never
even
thought
of
doing
the
marquis
bewildered
by
these
words
stifled
the
worst
anger
he
had
ever
felt
supposing
that
the
count
had
played
him
false
he
made
no
answer
ah
you
reflect
she
said
bitterly
mademoiselle
replied
the
young
man
your
doubts
justify
let
us
leave
this
room
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
catching
sight
of
a
corner
of
madame
du
gua
s
gown
and
rising
but
the
wish
to
reduce
her
rival
to
despair
was
too
strong
and
she
made
no
further
motion
to
go
do
you
mean
to
drive
me
to
hell
cried
the
marquis
seizing
her
hand
and
pressing
it
violently
did
you
not
drive
me
to
hell
five
days
ago
are
you
not
leaving
me
at
this
very
moment
uncertain
whether
your
love
is
sincere
or
not
but
how
do
i
know
whether
your
revenge
may
not
lead
you
to
obtain
my
life
to
tarnish
it
instead
of
killing
me
ah
you
do
not
love
me
you
think
of
yourself
and
not
of
me
she
said
angrily
shedding
a
few
tears
the
coquettish
creature
well
knew
the
power
of
her
eyes
when
moistened
by
tears
well
then
he
cried
beside
himself
take
my
life
but
dry
those
oh
my
love
my
love
she
exclaimed
in
a
stifled
voice
those
are
the
words
the
accents
the
looks
i
have
longed
for
to
allow
me
to
prefer
your
happiness
to
mine
but
she
added
i
ask
one
more
proof
of
your
love
which
you
say
is
so
great
i
wish
to
stay
here
only
so
long
as
may
be
needed
to
show
the
company
that
you
are
mine
i
will
not
even
drink
a
glass
of
water
in
the
house
of
a
woman
who
has
twice
tried
to
kill
me
who
is
now
perhaps
plotting
mischief
against
us
and
she
showed
the
marquis
the
floating
corner
of
madame
du
gua
s
drapery
then
she
dried
her
eyes
and
put
her
lips
to
the
ear
of
the
young
man
who
quivered
as
he
felt
the
caress
of
her
warm
breath
see
that
everything
is
prepared
for
my
departure
she
said
you
shall
take
me
yourself
to
fougeres
and
there
only
will
i
tell
you
if
i
love
you
for
the
second
time
i
trust
you
will
you
trust
me
a
second
time
ah
marie
you
have
brought
me
to
a
point
where
i
know
not
what
i
do
i
am
intoxicated
by
your
words
your
looks
by
you
by
you
and
i
am
ready
to
obey
well
then
make
me
for
an
instant
very
happy
let
me
enjoy
the
only
triumph
i
desire
i
want
to
breathe
freely
to
drink
of
the
life
i
have
dreamed
to
feed
my
illusions
before
they
are
gone
forever
come
come
into
the
ballroom
and
dance
with
they
the
room
together
and
though
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
as
completely
satisfied
in
heart
and
vanity
as
any
woman
ever
could
be
the
unfathomable
gentleness
of
her
eyes
the
demure
smile
on
her
lips
the
rapidity
of
the
motions
of
a
gay
dance
kept
the
secret
of
her
thoughts
as
the
sea
swallows
those
of
the
criminal
who
casts
a
weighted
body
into
its
depths
but
a
murmur
of
admiration
ran
through
the
company
as
circling
in
each
other
s
arms
voluptuously
interlaced
with
heavy
heads
and
dimmed
sight
they
waltzed
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
dreaming
of
the
pleasures
they
hoped
to
find
in
a
future
union
a
few
moments
later
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
the
marquis
were
in
the
latter
s
drawn
by
four
horses
surprised
to
see
these
enemies
hand
in
hand
and
evidently
understanding
each
other
francine
kept
silence
not
daring
to
ask
her
mistress
whether
her
conduct
was
that
of
treachery
or
love
thanks
to
the
darkness
the
marquis
did
not
observe
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
agitation
as
they
neared
fougeres
the
first
flush
of
dawn
showed
the
towers
of
in
the
distance
at
that
moment
marie
was
saying
to
herself
i
am
going
to
my
as
they
ascended
the
first
hill
the
lovers
had
the
same
thought
they
left
the
carriage
and
mounted
the
rise
on
foot
in
memory
of
their
first
meeting
when
marie
took
the
young
man
s
arm
she
thanked
him
by
a
smile
for
respecting
her
silence
then
as
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
looked
at
fougeres
she
threw
off
her
reverie
don
t
come
any
farther
she
said
my
authority
can
not
save
you
from
the
blues
montauran
showed
some
surprise
she
smiled
sadly
and
pointed
to
a
block
of
granite
as
if
to
tell
him
to
sit
down
while
she
herself
stood
before
him
in
a
melancholy
attitude
the
rending
emotions
of
her
soul
no
longer
permitted
her
to
play
a
part
at
that
moment
she
would
have
knelt
on
coals
without
feeling
them
any
more
than
the
marquis
had
felt
the
he
had
taken
in
his
hand
to
prove
the
strength
of
his
passion
it
was
not
until
she
had
contemplated
her
lover
with
a
look
of
the
deepest
anguish
that
she
said
to
him
at
last
all
that
you
have
suspected
of
me
is
the
marquis
started
ah
i
pray
you
she
said
clasping
her
hands
listen
to
me
without
interruption
i
am
indeed
the
daughter
of
the
duc
de
verneuil
but
his
natural
daughter
my
mother
a
demoiselle
de
casteran
who
became
a
nun
to
escape
the
reproaches
of
her
family
expiated
her
fault
by
fifteen
years
of
sorrow
and
died
at
seez
where
she
was
abbess
on
her
she
implored
for
the
first
time
and
only
for
me
the
help
of
the
man
who
had
betrayed
her
for
she
knew
she
was
leaving
me
without
friends
without
fortune
without
a
future
the
duke
accepted
the
charge
and
took
me
from
the
roof
of
francine
s
mother
who
had
hitherto
taken
care
of
me
perhaps
he
liked
me
because
i
was
beautiful
possibly
i
reminded
him
of
his
youth
he
was
one
of
those
great
lords
of
the
old
regime
who
took
pride
in
showing
how
they
could
get
their
crimes
forgiven
by
committing
them
with
grace
i
will
say
no
more
he
was
my
father
but
let
me
explain
to
you
how
my
life
in
paris
injured
my
soul
the
society
of
the
duc
de
verneuil
to
which
he
introduced
me
was
bitten
by
that
scoffing
philosophy
about
which
all
france
was
then
enthusiastic
because
it
was
wittily
professed
the
brilliant
conversations
which
charmed
my
ear
were
marked
by
subtlety
of
perception
and
by
witty
contempt
for
all
that
was
true
and
spiritual
men
laughed
at
sentiments
and
pictured
them
all
the
better
because
they
did
not
feel
them
their
satirical
epigrams
were
as
fascinating
as
the
humor
with
which
they
could
put
a
whole
adventure
into
a
word
and
yet
they
had
sometimes
too
much
wit
and
wearied
women
by
making
love
an
art
and
not
a
matter
of
feeling
i
could
not
resist
the
tide
and
yet
my
soul
was
too
ardent
forgive
this
pride
not
to
feel
that
their
minds
had
withered
their
hearts
and
the
life
i
led
resulted
in
a
perpetual
struggle
between
my
natural
feelings
and
beliefs
and
the
vicious
habits
of
mind
which
i
there
contracted
several
superior
men
took
pleasure
in
developing
in
me
that
liberty
of
thought
and
contempt
for
public
opinion
which
do
tear
from
a
woman
her
modesty
of
soul
robbed
of
which
she
loses
her
charm
alas
my
subsequent
misfortunes
have
failed
to
lessen
the
faults
i
learned
through
opulence
my
father
she
continued
with
a
sigh
the
duc
de
verneuil
died
after
duly
recognizing
me
as
his
daughter
and
making
provisions
for
me
by
his
will
which
considerably
reduced
the
fortune
of
my
brother
his
legitimate
son
i
found
myself
one
day
without
a
home
and
without
a
protector
my
brother
contested
the
will
which
made
me
rich
three
years
of
my
late
life
had
developed
my
vanity
by
satisfying
all
my
fancies
my
father
had
created
in
my
nature
a
need
of
luxury
and
given
me
habits
of
of
which
my
own
mind
young
and
artless
as
it
then
was
could
not
perceive
either
the
danger
or
the
tyranny
a
friend
of
my
father
the
marechal
duc
de
lenoncourt
then
seventy
years
old
offered
to
become
my
guardian
and
i
found
myself
soon
after
the
termination
of
the
odious
suit
in
a
brilliant
home
where
i
enjoyed
all
the
advantages
of
which
my
brother
s
cruelty
had
deprived
me
every
evening
the
old
marechal
came
to
sit
with
me
and
comfort
me
with
kind
and
consoling
words
his
white
hair
and
the
many
proofs
he
gave
me
of
paternal
tenderness
led
me
to
turn
all
the
feelings
of
my
heart
upon
him
and
i
felt
myself
his
daughter
i
accepted
his
presents
hiding
none
of
my
caprices
from
him
for
i
saw
how
he
loved
to
gratify
them
i
heard
one
fatal
evening
that
all
paris
believed
me
the
mistress
of
the
poor
old
man
i
was
told
that
it
was
then
beyond
my
power
to
recover
an
innocence
thus
gratuitously
denied
me
they
said
that
the
man
who
had
abused
my
inexperience
could
not
be
lover
and
would
not
be
my
husband
the
week
in
which
i
made
this
horrible
discovery
the
duke
left
paris
i
was
shamefully
ejected
from
the
house
where
he
had
placed
me
and
which
did
not
belong
to
him
up
to
this
point
i
have
told
you
the
truth
as
though
i
stood
before
god
but
now
do
not
ask
a
wretched
woman
to
give
account
of
sufferings
which
are
buried
in
her
heart
the
time
came
when
i
found
myself
married
to
danton
a
few
days
later
the
storm
uprooted
the
mighty
oak
around
which
i
had
thrown
my
arms
again
i
was
plunged
into
the
worst
distress
and
i
resolved
to
kill
myself
i
don
t
know
whether
love
of
life
or
the
hope
of
wearying
and
of
finding
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
the
happiness
which
had
always
escaped
me
were
unconsciously
to
myself
my
advisers
or
whether
i
was
fascinated
by
the
arguments
of
a
young
man
from
vendome
who
for
the
last
two
years
has
wound
himself
about
me
like
a
serpent
round
a
tree
in
short
i
know
not
how
it
is
that
i
accepted
for
a
payment
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
the
odious
mission
of
making
an
unknown
man
fall
in
love
with
me
and
then
betraying
him
i
met
you
i
knew
you
at
once
by
one
of
those
presentiments
which
never
mislead
us
yet
i
tried
to
doubt
my
recognition
for
the
more
i
came
to
love
you
the
more
the
certainty
appalled
me
when
i
saved
you
from
the
hands
of
hulot
i
abjured
the
part
i
had
taken
i
resolved
to
betray
the
slaughterers
and
not
their
victim
i
did
wrong
to
play
with
men
with
their
lives
their
principles
with
myself
like
a
thoughtless
girl
who
sees
only
sentiments
in
this
life
i
believed
you
loved
me
i
let
myself
cling
to
the
hope
that
my
life
might
begin
anew
but
all
things
have
revealed
my
past
even
i
myself
perhaps
for
you
must
have
distrusted
a
woman
so
passionate
as
you
have
found
me
alas
is
there
no
excuse
for
my
love
and
my
deception
my
life
was
like
a
troubled
sleep
i
woke
and
thought
myself
a
girl
i
was
in
alencon
where
all
my
memories
were
pure
and
chaste
i
had
the
mad
simplicity
to
think
that
love
would
baptize
me
into
innocence
for
a
moment
i
thought
myself
pure
for
i
had
never
loved
but
last
night
your
passion
seemed
to
me
true
and
a
voice
cried
to
me
do
not
deceive
monsieur
le
marquis
she
said
in
a
guttural
voice
which
haughtily
challenged
condemnation
know
this
i
am
a
dishonored
creature
unworthy
of
you
from
this
hour
i
accept
my
fate
as
a
lost
woman
i
am
weary
of
playing
a
part
the
part
of
a
woman
to
whom
you
had
brought
back
the
sanctities
of
her
soul
virtue
is
a
burden
to
me
i
should
despise
you
if
you
were
weak
enough
to
marry
me
the
comte
de
bauvan
might
commit
that
folly
but
you
you
must
be
worthy
of
your
future
and
leave
me
without
regret
a
courtesan
is
too
exacting
i
should
not
love
you
like
the
simple
artless
girl
who
felt
for
a
moment
the
delightful
hope
of
being
your
companion
of
making
you
happy
of
doing
you
honor
of
becoming
a
noble
wife
but
i
gather
from
that
futile
hope
the
courage
to
return
to
a
life
of
vice
and
infamy
that
i
may
put
an
eternal
barrier
between
us
i
sacrifice
both
honor
and
fortune
to
you
the
pride
i
take
in
that
sacrifice
will
support
me
in
my
wretchedness
fate
may
dispose
of
me
as
it
will
i
will
never
betray
you
i
shall
return
to
paris
there
your
name
will
be
to
me
a
part
of
myself
and
the
glory
you
win
will
console
my
grief
as
for
you
you
are
a
man
and
you
will
forget
me
she
darted
away
in
the
direction
of
the
gorges
of
and
disappeared
before
the
marquis
could
rise
to
detain
her
but
she
came
back
unseen
hid
herself
in
a
cavity
of
the
rocks
and
examined
the
young
man
with
a
curiosity
mingled
with
doubt
presently
she
saw
him
walking
like
a
man
overwhelmed
without
seeming
to
know
where
he
went
can
he
be
weak
she
thought
when
he
had
disappeared
and
she
felt
she
was
parted
from
him
will
he
understand
me
she
quivered
then
she
turned
and
went
rapidly
towards
fougeres
as
though
she
feared
the
marquis
might
follow
her
into
the
town
where
certain
death
awaited
him
francine
what
did
he
say
to
you
she
asked
when
the
faithful
girl
rejoined
her
ah
marie
how
i
pitied
him
you
great
ladies
stab
a
man
with
your
how
did
he
seem
when
he
came
up
to
you
as
if
he
saw
me
not
at
all
oh
marie
he
loves
you
yes
he
loves
me
or
he
does
not
love
me
there
is
heaven
or
hell
for
me
in
that
she
answered
between
the
two
extremes
there
is
no
spot
where
i
can
set
my
after
thus
carrying
out
her
resolution
marie
gave
way
to
grief
and
her
face
beautified
till
then
by
these
conflicting
sentiments
changed
for
the
worse
so
rapidly
that
in
a
single
day
during
which
she
floated
incessantly
between
hope
and
despair
she
lost
the
glow
of
beauty
and
the
freshness
which
has
its
source
in
the
absence
of
passion
or
the
ardor
of
joy
anxious
to
ascertain
the
result
of
her
mad
enterprise
hulot
and
corentin
came
to
see
her
soon
after
her
return
she
received
them
smiling
well
she
said
to
the
commandant
whose
face
had
a
questioning
expression
the
fox
is
coming
within
range
of
your
guns
you
will
soon
have
a
glorious
triumph
over
what
happened
asked
corentin
carelessly
giving
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
one
of
those
oblique
glances
with
which
diplomatists
of
his
class
spy
on
thought
ah
she
said
the
gars
is
more
in
love
than
ever
i
made
him
come
with
me
to
the
gates
of
your
power
seems
to
have
stopped
there
remarked
corentin
the
fears
of
your
are
greater
than
the
love
you
you
judge
him
by
yourself
she
replied
with
a
contemptuous
look
well
then
said
he
unmoved
why
did
you
not
bring
him
here
to
your
own
house
commandant
she
said
to
hulot
with
a
coaxing
smile
if
he
really
loves
me
would
you
blame
me
for
saving
his
life
and
getting
him
to
leave
france
the
old
soldier
came
quickly
up
to
her
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
a
sort
of
enthusiasm
then
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
and
said
in
a
gloomy
tone
you
forget
my
two
friends
and
my
ah
commandant
she
cried
with
all
the
naivete
of
passion
he
was
not
accountable
for
that
he
was
deceived
by
a
bad
woman
charette
s
mistress
who
would
i
do
believe
drink
the
blood
of
the
come
marie
said
corentin
don
t
tease
the
commandant
he
does
not
understand
such
hold
your
tongue
she
answered
and
remember
that
the
day
when
you
displease
me
too
much
will
have
no
morrow
for
i
see
mademoiselle
said
hulot
without
bitterness
that
i
must
prepare
for
a
you
are
not
strong
enough
my
dear
colonel
i
saw
more
than
six
thousand
men
at
regular
troops
artillery
and
english
officers
but
they
can
not
do
much
unless
leads
them
i
agree
with
fouche
his
presence
is
the
head
and
front
of
are
we
to
get
his
head
that
s
the
point
said
corentin
impatiently
i
don
t
know
she
answered
carelessly
english
officers
cried
hulot
angrily
that
s
all
that
was
wanting
to
make
a
regular
brigand
of
him
ha
ha
i
ll
give
him
english
i
will
it
seems
to
me
said
hulot
to
corentin
after
the
two
had
taken
leave
and
were
at
some
distance
from
the
house
that
you
allow
that
girl
to
send
you
to
the
when
she
it
is
quite
natural
for
you
commandant
replied
corentin
with
a
thoughtful
air
to
see
nothing
but
fighting
in
what
she
said
to
us
you
soldiers
never
seem
to
know
there
are
various
ways
of
making
war
to
use
the
passions
of
men
and
women
like
wires
to
be
pulled
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
to
keep
the
of
the
great
machine
we
call
government
in
good
order
and
fasten
to
it
the
desires
of
human
nature
like
baited
traps
which
it
is
fun
to
watch
i
call
creating
a
world
like
god
and
putting
ourselves
at
the
centre
of
it
you
will
please
allow
me
to
prefer
my
calling
to
yours
said
the
soldier
curtly
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
your
i
recognize
no
authority
but
that
of
the
minister
of
war
i
have
my
orders
i
shall
take
the
field
with
veterans
who
don
t
skulk
and
face
an
enemy
you
want
to
catch
oh
you
can
fight
if
you
want
to
replied
corentin
from
what
that
girl
has
dropped
as
you
think
she
is
i
can
tell
you
that
you
ll
have
to
skirmish
about
and
i
myself
will
give
you
the
pleasure
of
an
interview
with
the
gars
before
how
so
asked
hulot
moving
back
a
step
to
get
a
better
view
of
this
strange
individual
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
is
in
love
with
him
replied
corentin
in
a
thick
voice
and
perhaps
he
loves
her
a
marquis
a
knight
of
young
brilliant
perhaps
rich
what
a
list
of
temptations
she
would
be
foolish
indeed
not
to
look
after
her
own
interests
and
try
to
marry
him
rather
than
betray
him
the
girl
is
attempting
to
fool
us
but
i
saw
hesitation
in
her
eyes
they
probably
have
a
rendezvous
perhaps
they
ve
met
already
well
i
shall
have
him
by
the
forelock
yesterday
he
was
nothing
more
than
the
enemy
of
the
republic
he
is
mine
and
i
tell
you
this
every
man
who
has
been
so
rash
as
to
come
between
that
girl
and
me
has
died
upon
the
so
saying
corentin
dropped
into
a
reverie
which
hindered
him
from
observing
the
disgust
on
the
face
of
the
honest
soldier
as
he
discovered
the
depths
of
this
intrigue
and
the
mechanism
of
the
means
employed
by
fouche
hulot
resolved
on
the
spot
to
thwart
corentin
in
every
way
that
did
not
conflict
essentially
with
the
success
of
the
government
and
to
give
the
gars
a
fair
chance
of
dying
honorably
sword
in
hand
before
he
could
fall
a
prey
to
the
executioner
for
whom
this
agent
of
the
detective
police
acknowledged
himself
the
purveyor
if
the
first
consul
would
listen
to
me
thought
hulot
as
he
turned
his
back
on
corentin
he
would
leave
those
foxes
to
fight
aristocrats
and
send
his
solders
on
other
corentin
looked
coldly
after
the
old
soldier
whose
face
had
brightened
at
the
resolve
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
sardonic
expression
which
showed
the
mental
superiority
of
this
subaltern
machiavelli
give
an
ell
of
blue
cloth
to
those
fellows
and
hang
a
bit
of
iron
at
their
waists
he
said
to
himself
and
they
ll
think
there
s
but
one
way
to
kill
then
after
walking
up
and
down
awhile
very
slowly
he
exclaimed
suddenly
yes
the
time
has
come
that
woman
shall
be
mine
for
five
years
i
ve
been
drawing
the
net
round
her
and
i
have
her
now
with
her
i
can
be
a
greater
man
in
the
government
than
fouche
himself
yes
if
she
loses
the
only
man
she
has
ever
loved
grief
will
give
her
to
me
body
and
soul
but
i
must
be
on
the
watch
night
and
a
few
moments
later
the
pale
face
of
this
man
might
have
been
seen
through
the
window
of
a
house
from
which
he
could
observe
all
who
entered
the
formed
by
the
line
of
houses
running
parallel
with
one
of
those
houses
being
that
now
occupied
by
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
with
the
patience
of
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
corentin
was
there
in
the
same
place
on
the
following
morning
attentive
to
the
slightest
noise
and
subjecting
the
to
the
closest
examination
the
day
that
was
now
beginning
was
a
although
in
these
calamitous
times
the
peasants
rarely
risked
themselves
in
the
towns
corentin
presently
noticed
a
small
man
with
a
gloomy
face
wrapped
in
a
goatskin
and
carrying
on
his
arm
a
small
flat
basket
he
was
making
his
way
in
the
direction
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
house
casting
careless
glances
about
him
corentin
watched
him
enter
the
house
then
he
ran
down
into
the
street
meaning
to
waylay
the
man
as
he
left
but
on
second
thoughts
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
called
unexpectedly
on
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
he
might
surprise
by
a
single
glance
the
secret
that
was
hidden
in
the
basket
of
the
emissary
besides
he
had
already
learned
that
it
was
impossible
to
extract
anything
from
the
inscrutable
answers
of
bretons
and
normans
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
when
francine
brought
the
man
to
her
does
he
love
me
she
murmured
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
the
instinctive
hope
sent
a
brilliant
color
to
her
cheeks
and
joy
into
her
heart
looked
alternately
from
the
mistress
to
the
maid
with
evident
distrust
of
the
latter
but
a
sign
from
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
reassured
him
madame
he
said
about
two
o
clock
will
be
at
my
house
waiting
for
emotion
prevented
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
from
giving
any
other
reply
than
a
movement
of
her
head
but
the
man
understood
her
meaning
at
that
moment
corentin
s
step
was
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
but
showed
no
uneasiness
though
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
look
and
shudder
warned
him
of
danger
and
as
soon
as
the
spy
had
entered
the
room
the
chouan
raised
his
voice
to
an
tone
ha
ha
he
said
to
francine
i
tell
you
there
s
breton
butter
breton
butter
you
want
the
gibarry
kind
and
you
won
t
give
more
than
eleven
sous
a
pound
then
why
did
you
send
me
to
fetch
it
it
is
good
butter
that
he
added
uncovering
the
basket
to
show
the
pats
which
barbette
had
made
you
ought
to
be
fair
my
good
lady
and
pay
one
sou
his
hollow
voice
betrayed
no
emotion
and
his
green
eyes
shaded
by
thick
gray
eyebrows
bore
corentin
s
piercing
glance
without
flinching
nonsense
my
good
man
you
are
not
here
to
sell
butter
you
are
talking
to
a
lady
who
never
bargained
for
a
thing
in
her
life
the
trade
you
run
old
fellow
will
shorten
you
by
a
head
in
a
very
few
days
and
corentin
with
a
friendly
tap
on
the
man
s
shoulder
added
you
can
t
keep
up
being
a
spy
of
the
blues
and
a
spy
of
the
chouans
very
needed
all
his
presence
of
mind
to
subdue
his
rage
and
not
deny
the
accusation
which
his
avarice
had
made
a
just
one
he
contented
himself
with
saying
monsieur
is
making
game
of
corentin
turned
his
back
on
the
chouan
but
while
bowing
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
whose
heart
stood
still
he
watched
him
in
the
mirror
behind
her
unaware
of
this
gave
a
glance
to
francine
to
which
she
replied
by
pointing
to
the
door
and
saying
come
with
me
my
man
and
we
will
settle
the
matter
between
nothing
escaped
corentin
neither
the
fear
which
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
could
not
conceal
under
a
smile
nor
her
color
and
the
contraction
of
her
features
nor
the
chouan
s
sign
and
francine
s
reply
he
had
seen
all
convinced
that
was
sent
by
the
marquis
he
caught
the
man
by
the
long
hairs
of
his
goatskin
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
turned
him
round
to
face
him
and
said
with
a
keen
look
where
do
you
live
my
man
i
want
butter
my
good
monsieur
said
the
chouan
all
fougeres
knows
where
i
live
i
am
corentin
exclaimed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
interrupting
why
do
you
come
here
at
this
time
of
day
i
am
scarcely
dressed
let
that
peasant
alone
he
does
not
understand
your
tricks
any
more
than
i
understand
the
motive
of
them
you
can
go
my
hesitated
a
moment
the
indecision
real
or
feigned
of
the
poor
devil
who
knew
not
which
to
obey
deceived
even
corentin
but
the
chouan
finally
after
an
imperative
gesture
from
the
lady
left
the
room
with
a
dragging
step
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
corentin
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
this
time
marie
s
limpid
eyes
could
not
endure
the
gleam
of
cruel
fire
in
the
man
s
look
the
resolute
manner
in
which
the
spy
had
forced
his
way
into
her
room
an
expression
on
his
face
which
marie
had
never
seen
there
before
the
deadened
tones
of
his
shrill
voice
his
whole
demeanor
all
these
things
alarmed
her
she
felt
that
a
secret
struggle
was
about
to
take
place
between
them
and
that
he
meant
to
employ
against
her
all
the
powers
of
his
evil
influence
but
though
she
had
at
this
moment
a
full
and
distinct
view
of
the
gulf
into
which
she
was
plunging
she
gathered
strength
from
her
love
to
shake
off
the
icy
chill
of
these
presentiments
corentin
she
said
with
a
sort
of
gayety
i
hope
you
are
going
to
let
me
make
my
toilet
marie
he
said
yes
permit
me
to
call
you
so
you
don
t
yet
know
me
listen
a
much
less
sagacious
man
than
i
would
see
your
love
for
the
marquis
de
montauran
i
have
several
times
offered
you
my
heart
and
hand
you
have
never
thought
me
worthy
of
you
and
perhaps
you
are
right
but
however
much
you
may
feel
yourself
too
high
too
beautiful
too
superior
for
me
i
can
compel
you
to
come
down
to
my
level
my
ambition
and
my
maxims
have
given
you
a
low
opinion
of
me
frankly
you
are
mistaken
men
are
not
worth
even
what
i
rate
them
at
and
that
is
next
to
nothing
i
shall
certainly
attain
a
position
which
will
gratify
your
pride
who
will
ever
love
you
better
or
make
you
more
absolutely
mistress
of
yourself
and
of
him
than
the
man
who
has
loved
you
now
for
five
years
though
i
run
the
risk
of
exciting
your
suspicions
for
you
can
not
conceive
that
any
one
should
renounce
an
idolized
woman
out
of
excessive
love
i
will
now
prove
to
you
the
unselfishness
of
my
passion
if
the
marquis
loves
you
marry
him
but
before
you
do
so
make
sure
of
his
sincerity
i
could
not
endure
to
see
you
deceived
for
i
do
prefer
your
happiness
to
my
own
my
resolution
may
surprise
you
lay
it
to
the
prudence
of
a
man
who
is
not
so
great
a
fool
as
to
wish
to
possess
a
woman
against
her
will
i
blame
myself
not
you
for
the
failure
of
my
efforts
to
win
you
i
hoped
to
do
so
by
submission
and
devotion
for
i
have
long
as
you
well
know
tried
to
make
you
happy
according
to
my
lights
but
you
have
never
in
any
way
rewarded
i
have
suffered
you
to
be
near
me
she
said
haughtily
add
that
you
regret
after
involving
me
in
this
infamous
enterprise
do
you
think
that
i
have
any
thanks
to
give
you
when
i
proposed
to
you
an
enterprise
which
was
not
exempt
from
blame
to
timid
minds
he
replied
audaciously
i
had
only
your
own
prosperity
in
view
as
for
me
whether
i
succeed
or
fail
i
can
make
all
results
further
my
ends
if
you
marry
montauran
i
shall
be
delighted
to
serve
the
bourbons
in
paris
where
i
am
already
a
member
of
the
clichy
club
now
if
circumstances
were
to
put
me
in
correspondence
with
the
princes
i
should
abandon
the
interests
of
the
republic
which
is
already
on
its
last
legs
general
bonaparte
is
much
too
able
a
man
not
to
know
that
he
can
t
be
in
england
and
in
italy
at
the
same
time
and
that
is
how
the
republic
is
about
to
fall
i
have
no
doubt
he
made
the
brumaire
to
obtain
greater
advantages
over
the
bourbons
when
it
came
to
treating
with
them
he
is
a
fellow
and
very
keen
but
the
politicians
will
get
the
better
of
him
on
their
own
ground
the
betrayal
of
france
is
another
scruple
which
men
of
superiority
leave
to
fools
i
won
t
conceal
from
you
that
i
have
come
here
with
the
necessary
authority
to
open
negotiations
with
the
chouans
to
further
their
destruction
as
the
case
may
be
for
fouche
my
patron
is
deep
he
has
always
played
a
double
part
during
the
terror
he
was
as
much
for
robespierre
as
for
danton
whom
you
basely
abandoned
she
said
nonsense
he
is
dead
forget
him
replied
corentin
come
speak
honestly
to
me
i
have
set
you
the
example
old
hulot
is
deeper
than
he
looks
if
you
want
to
escape
his
vigilance
i
can
help
you
remember
that
he
holds
all
the
valleys
and
will
instantly
detect
a
rendezvous
if
you
make
one
in
fougeres
under
his
very
eyes
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
his
patrols
see
how
quickly
he
knew
that
this
chouan
had
entered
your
house
his
military
sagacity
will
show
him
that
your
movements
betray
those
of
the
gars
if
montauran
loves
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
never
listened
to
a
more
affectionate
voice
corentin
certainly
seemed
sincere
and
spoke
confidingly
the
poor
girl
s
heart
was
so
open
to
generous
impressions
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
her
secret
to
the
serpent
who
had
her
in
his
folds
when
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
no
proof
beyond
his
own
words
of
his
sincerity
and
she
felt
no
scruple
in
blinding
him
yes
she
said
you
are
right
corentin
i
do
love
the
marquis
but
he
does
not
love
me
at
least
i
fear
so
i
can
t
help
fearing
that
the
appointment
he
wishes
me
to
make
with
him
is
a
but
you
said
yesterday
that
he
came
as
far
as
fougeres
with
you
returned
corentin
if
he
had
meant
to
do
you
bodily
harm
you
wouldn
t
be
here
you
ve
a
cold
heart
corentin
you
can
draw
shrewd
conclusions
as
to
the
ordinary
events
of
human
life
but
not
on
those
of
passion
perhaps
that
is
why
you
inspire
me
with
such
repulsion
as
you
are
so
you
may
be
able
to
tell
me
why
a
man
from
whom
i
separated
myself
violently
two
days
ago
now
wishes
me
to
meet
him
in
a
house
at
florigny
on
the
road
to
at
this
avowal
which
seemed
to
escape
her
with
a
recklessness
that
was
not
unnatural
in
so
passionate
a
creature
corentin
flushed
for
he
was
still
young
but
he
gave
her
a
sidelong
penetrating
look
trying
to
search
her
soul
the
girl
s
artlessness
was
so
well
played
however
that
she
deceived
the
spy
and
he
answered
with
crafty
shall
i
accompany
you
at
a
distance
i
can
take
a
few
solders
with
me
and
be
ready
to
help
and
obey
very
good
she
said
but
promise
me
on
your
honor
no
i
don
t
believe
in
it
by
your
salvation
but
you
don
t
believe
in
god
by
your
soul
but
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
any
what
pledge
you
give
me
of
your
fidelity
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
trust
you
and
put
more
than
my
life
my
love
my
vengeance
into
your
hands
the
slight
smile
which
crossed
the
pallid
lips
of
the
spy
showed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
danger
she
had
just
escaped
the
man
whose
nostrils
contracted
instead
of
dilating
took
the
hand
of
his
victim
kissed
it
with
every
mark
of
the
deepest
respect
and
left
the
room
with
a
bow
that
was
not
devoid
of
grace
three
hours
after
this
scene
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
who
feared
the
man
s
return
left
the
town
furtively
by
the
porte
and
made
her
way
through
the
labyrinth
of
paths
to
the
cottage
of
led
by
the
dream
of
at
last
finding
happiness
and
also
by
the
purpose
of
saving
her
lover
from
the
danger
that
threatened
him
during
this
time
corentin
had
gone
to
find
the
commandant
he
had
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
hulot
when
he
found
him
in
a
little
square
where
he
was
busy
with
certain
military
preparations
the
brave
veteran
had
made
a
sacrifice
the
full
merit
of
which
may
be
difficult
to
appreciate
his
queue
and
his
moustache
were
cut
off
and
his
hair
had
a
sprinkling
of
powder
he
had
changed
his
uniform
for
a
goatskin
wore
hobnailed
shoes
a
belt
full
of
pistols
and
carried
a
heavy
carbine
in
this
costume
he
was
reviewing
about
two
hundred
of
the
natives
of
fougeres
all
in
the
same
kind
of
dress
which
was
fitted
to
deceive
the
eye
of
the
most
practised
chouan
the
warlike
spirit
of
the
little
town
and
the
breton
character
were
fully
displayed
in
this
scene
which
was
not
at
all
uncommon
here
and
there
a
few
mothers
and
sisters
were
bringing
to
their
sons
and
brothers
gourds
filled
with
brandy
or
forgotten
pistols
several
old
men
were
examining
into
the
number
and
condition
of
the
cartridges
of
these
young
national
guards
dressed
in
the
guise
of
chouans
whose
gaiety
was
more
in
keeping
with
a
hunting
expedition
than
the
dangerous
duty
they
were
undertaking
to
them
such
encounters
with
chouannerie
where
the
breton
of
the
town
fought
the
breton
of
the
country
district
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
chivalric
tournaments
this
patriotic
enthusiasm
may
possibly
have
been
connected
with
certain
purchases
of
the
national
still
the
benefits
of
the
revolution
which
were
better
understood
and
appreciated
in
the
towns
party
spirit
and
a
certain
national
delight
in
war
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
their
ardor
hulot
much
gratified
was
going
through
the
ranks
and
getting
information
from
gudin
on
whom
he
was
now
bestowing
the
confidence
and
he
had
formerly
shown
to
merle
and
gerard
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
stood
about
watching
the
preparations
and
comparing
the
conduct
of
their
tumultuous
contingent
with
the
regulars
of
hulot
s
brigade
motionless
and
silent
the
blues
were
awaiting
under
control
of
their
officers
the
orders
of
the
commandant
whose
figure
they
followed
with
their
eyes
as
he
passed
from
rank
to
rank
of
the
contingent
when
corentin
came
near
the
old
warrior
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
him
he
looked
like
a
portrait
that
has
little
or
no
resemblance
to
the
original
what
s
all
this
asked
corentin
come
with
us
under
fire
and
you
ll
find
out
replied
hulot
oh
i
m
not
a
fougeres
man
said
corentin
easy
to
see
that
citizen
retorted
gudin
a
few
contemptuous
laughs
came
from
the
nearest
ranks
do
you
think
said
corentin
sharply
that
the
only
way
to
serve
france
is
with
bayonets
then
he
turned
his
back
to
the
laughers
and
asked
a
woman
beside
him
if
she
knew
the
object
of
the
expedition
hey
my
good
man
the
chouans
are
at
florigny
they
say
there
are
more
than
three
thousand
and
they
are
coming
to
take
florigny
cried
corentin
turning
white
then
the
rendezvous
is
not
there
is
florigny
on
the
road
to
mayenne
he
asked
there
are
not
two
florignys
replied
the
woman
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
summit
of
la
pelerine
are
you
going
in
search
of
the
marquis
de
montauran
said
corentin
to
hulot
perhaps
i
am
answered
the
commandant
curtly
he
is
not
at
florigny
said
corentin
send
your
troops
there
by
all
means
but
keep
a
few
of
those
imitation
chouans
of
yours
with
you
and
wait
for
he
is
too
malignant
not
to
know
what
he
s
about
thought
hulot
as
corentin
made
off
rapidly
he
s
the
king
of
hulot
ordered
the
battalion
to
start
the
republican
soldiers
marched
without
drums
and
silently
through
the
narrow
suburb
which
led
to
the
mayenne
forming
a
blue
and
red
line
among
the
trees
and
houses
the
disguised
guard
followed
them
but
hulot
detaining
gudin
and
about
a
score
of
the
smartest
young
fellows
of
the
town
remained
in
the
little
square
awaiting
corentin
whose
mysterious
manner
had
piqued
his
curiosity
francine
herself
told
the
astute
spy
whose
suspicions
she
changed
into
certainty
of
her
mistress
s
departure
inquiring
of
the
post
guard
at
the
porte
he
learned
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
had
passed
that
way
rushing
to
the
promenade
he
was
unfortunately
in
time
to
see
her
movements
though
she
was
wearing
a
green
dress
and
hood
to
be
less
easily
distinguished
the
rapidity
of
her
almost
distracted
step
enabled
him
to
follow
her
with
his
eye
through
the
leafless
hedges
and
to
guess
the
point
towards
which
she
was
hurrying
ha
he
cried
you
said
you
were
going
to
florigny
but
you
are
in
the
valley
of
gibarry
i
am
a
fool
she
has
tricked
me
no
matter
i
can
light
my
lamp
by
day
as
well
as
by
corentin
satisfied
that
he
knew
the
place
of
the
lovers
rendezvous
returned
in
all
haste
to
the
little
square
which
hulot
resolved
not
to
wait
any
longer
was
just
quitting
to
rejoin
his
troops
halt
general
he
cried
to
the
commandant
who
turned
round
he
then
told
hulot
the
events
relating
to
the
marquis
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
showed
him
the
scheme
of
which
he
held
a
thread
hulot
struck
by
his
perspicacity
seized
him
by
the
arm
god
s
thunder
citizen
you
are
right
he
cried
the
brigands
are
making
a
false
attack
over
there
to
keep
the
coast
clear
but
the
two
columns
i
sent
to
scour
the
environs
between
antrain
and
vitre
have
not
yet
returned
so
we
shall
have
plenty
of
reinforcements
if
we
need
them
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
for
the
gars
is
not
such
a
fool
as
to
risk
his
life
without
a
bodyguard
of
those
damned
owls
gudin
he
added
go
and
tell
captain
lebrun
that
he
must
rub
those
fellows
noses
at
florigny
without
me
and
come
back
yourself
in
a
flash
you
know
the
paths
i
ll
wait
till
you
return
and
we
ll
avenge
those
murders
at
la
vivetiere
thunder
how
he
runs
he
added
seeing
gudin
disappear
as
if
by
magic
gerard
would
have
loved
on
his
return
gudin
found
hulot
s
little
band
increased
in
numbers
by
the
arrival
of
several
soldiers
taken
from
the
various
posts
in
the
town
the
commandant
ordered
him
to
choose
a
dozen
of
his
compatriots
who
could
best
counterfeit
the
chouans
and
take
them
out
by
the
porte
so
as
to
creep
round
the
side
of
the
rocks
which
overlooks
the
valley
of
couesnon
and
on
which
was
the
hovel
of
hulot
himself
went
out
with
the
rest
of
his
troop
by
the
porte
to
reach
the
summit
of
the
same
rocks
where
according
to
his
calculations
he
ought
to
meet
the
men
under
whom
he
meant
to
use
as
a
line
of
sentinels
from
the
suburb
of
to
the
corentin
satisfied
with
having
delivered
over
the
fate
of
the
gars
to
his
implacable
enemies
went
with
all
speed
to
the
promenade
so
as
to
follow
with
his
eyes
the
military
arrangements
of
the
commandant
he
soon
saw
gudin
s
little
squad
issuing
from
the
valley
of
the
nancon
and
following
the
line
of
the
rocks
to
the
great
valley
while
hulot
creeping
round
the
castle
of
fougeres
was
mounting
the
dangerous
path
which
leads
to
the
summit
of
the
two
companies
were
therefore
advancing
on
parallel
lines
the
trees
and
shrubs
draped
by
the
rich
arabesques
of
the
hoarfrost
threw
whitish
reflections
which
enabled
the
watcher
to
see
the
gray
lines
of
the
squads
in
motion
when
hulot
reached
the
summit
of
the
rocks
he
detached
all
the
soldiers
in
uniform
from
his
main
body
and
made
them
into
a
line
of
sentinels
each
communicating
with
the
other
the
first
with
gudin
the
last
with
hulot
so
that
no
shrub
could
escape
the
bayonets
of
the
three
lines
which
were
now
in
a
position
to
hunt
the
gars
across
field
and
mountain
the
sly
old
wolf
thought
corentin
as
the
shining
muzzle
of
the
last
gun
disappeared
in
the
bushes
the
gars
is
done
for
if
marie
had
only
betrayed
that
damned
marquis
she
and
i
would
have
been
united
in
the
strongest
of
all
bonds
a
vile
deed
but
she
s
mine
in
any
the
twelve
young
men
under
gudin
soon
reached
the
base
of
the
rocks
of
here
gudin
himself
left
the
road
with
six
of
them
jumping
the
stiff
hedge
into
the
first
field
of
gorse
that
he
came
to
while
the
other
six
by
his
orders
did
the
same
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
gudin
advanced
to
an
which
happened
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
field
hearing
the
rustle
of
this
movement
through
the
gorse
seven
or
eight
men
at
the
head
of
whom
was
hastily
hid
behind
some
which
topped
the
bank
of
this
particular
field
gudin
s
men
did
not
see
them
in
spite
of
the
white
reflections
of
the
and
their
own
practised
sight
hush
here
they
are
said
cautiously
putting
out
his
head
the
brigands
have
more
men
than
we
but
we
have
em
at
the
muzzles
of
our
guns
and
we
mustn
t
miss
them
or
by
the
lord
we
are
not
fit
to
be
soldiers
of
the
by
this
time
gudin
s
keen
eyes
had
discovered
a
few
muzzles
pointing
through
the
branches
at
his
little
squad
just
then
eight
voices
cried
in
derision
qui
vive
and
eight
shots
followed
the
balls
whistled
round
gudin
and
his
men
one
fell
another
was
shot
in
the
arm
the
five
others
who
were
safe
and
sound
replied
with
a
volley
and
the
cry
friends
then
they
marched
rapidly
on
their
assailants
so
as
to
reach
them
before
they
had
time
to
reload
we
did
not
know
how
true
we
spoke
cried
gudin
as
he
recognized
the
uniforms
and
the
battered
hats
of
his
own
brigade
well
we
behaved
like
bretons
and
fought
before
the
other
men
were
stupefied
on
recognizing
the
little
company
who
the
devil
would
have
known
them
in
those
goatskins
cried
dismally
it
is
a
misfortune
said
gudin
but
we
are
all
innocent
if
you
were
not
informed
of
the
sortie
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
a
dozen
of
those
chouans
are
amusing
themselves
by
picking
us
off
and
we
are
getting
away
as
best
we
can
like
poisoned
rats
but
by
dint
of
scrambling
over
these
hedges
and
rocks
may
the
lightning
blast
em
our
compasses
have
got
so
rusty
we
are
forced
to
take
a
rest
i
think
those
brigands
are
now
somewhere
near
the
old
hovel
where
you
see
that
good
cried
gudin
you
he
added
to
and
his
men
fall
back
towards
the
rocks
through
the
fields
and
join
the
line
of
sentinels
you
ll
find
there
you
can
t
go
with
us
because
you
are
in
uniform
we
mean
to
make
an
end
of
those
curs
now
the
gars
is
with
them
i
can
t
stop
to
tell
you
more
to
the
right
march
and
don
t
administer
any
more
shots
to
our
own
goatskins
you
ll
know
ours
by
their
cravats
which
they
twist
round
their
necks
and
don
t
gudin
left
his
two
wounded
men
under
the
and
marched
towards
s
cottage
which
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
serving
as
a
guide
while
the
young
officer
was
thus
closing
in
upon
the
chouans
the
little
detachment
under
hulot
had
reached
a
point
still
parallel
with
that
at
which
gudin
had
arrived
the
old
soldier
at
the
head
of
his
men
was
silently
gliding
along
the
hedges
with
the
ardor
of
a
young
man
he
jumped
them
from
time
to
time
actively
enough
casting
his
wary
eyes
to
the
heights
and
listening
with
the
ear
of
a
hunter
to
every
noise
in
the
third
field
to
which
he
came
he
found
a
woman
about
thirty
years
old
with
bent
back
hoeing
the
ground
vigorously
while
a
small
boy
with
a
sickle
in
his
hand
was
knocking
the
hoarfrost
from
the
rushes
which
he
cut
and
laid
in
a
heap
at
the
noise
hulot
made
in
jumping
the
hedge
the
boy
and
his
mother
raised
their
heads
hulot
mistook
the
young
woman
for
an
old
one
naturally
enough
wrinkles
coming
long
before
their
time
furrowed
her
face
and
neck
she
was
clothed
so
grotesquely
in
a
goatskin
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
dirty
yellow
petticoat
a
distinctive
mark
of
sex
hulot
would
hardly
have
known
the
gender
she
belonged
to
for
the
meshes
of
her
long
black
hair
were
twisted
up
and
hidden
by
a
red
worsted
cap
the
tatters
of
the
little
boy
did
not
cover
him
but
left
his
skin
exposed
ho
old
woman
called
hulot
in
a
low
voice
approaching
her
where
is
the
gars
the
twenty
men
who
accompanied
hulot
now
jumped
the
hedge
hey
if
you
want
the
gars
you
ll
have
to
go
back
the
way
you
came
said
the
woman
with
a
suspicious
glance
at
the
troop
did
i
ask
you
the
road
to
fougeres
old
carcass
said
hulot
roughly
by
of
auray
have
you
seen
the
gars
go
by
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
replied
the
woman
bending
over
her
hoe
you
damned
garce
do
you
want
to
have
us
eaten
up
by
the
blues
who
are
after
us
at
these
words
the
woman
raised
her
head
and
gave
another
look
of
distrust
at
the
troop
as
she
replied
how
can
the
blues
be
after
you
i
have
just
seen
eight
or
ten
of
them
who
were
going
back
to
fougeres
by
the
lower
one
would
think
she
meant
to
stab
us
with
that
nose
of
hers
cried
hulot
here
look
you
old
and
he
showed
her
in
the
distance
three
or
four
of
his
sentinels
whose
hats
guns
and
uniforms
it
was
easy
to
recognize
are
you
going
to
let
those
fellows
cut
the
throats
of
men
who
are
sent
by
to
protect
the
gars
he
cried
angrily
ah
beg
pardon
said
the
woman
but
it
is
so
easy
to
be
deceived
what
parish
do
you
belong
to
replied
two
or
three
of
the
men
in
the
breton
patois
and
we
are
dying
of
well
there
said
the
woman
do
you
see
that
smoke
down
there
that
s
my
house
follow
the
path
to
the
right
and
you
will
come
to
the
rock
above
it
perhaps
you
ll
meet
my
man
on
the
way
is
sure
to
be
on
watch
to
warn
the
gars
he
is
spending
the
day
in
our
house
she
said
proudly
as
you
seem
to
thank
you
my
good
woman
replied
hulot
forward
march
god
s
thunder
we
ve
got
him
he
added
speaking
to
his
men
the
detachment
followed
its
leader
at
a
quick
step
through
the
path
pointed
out
to
them
the
wife
of
turned
pale
as
she
heard
the
oath
of
the
chouan
she
looked
at
the
gaiters
and
goatskins
of
his
men
then
she
caught
her
boy
in
her
arms
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
saying
may
the
holy
virgin
of
auray
and
the
ever
blessed
have
pity
upon
us
those
men
are
not
ours
their
shoes
have
no
nails
in
them
run
down
by
the
lower
road
and
warn
your
father
you
may
save
his
head
she
said
to
the
boy
who
disappeared
like
a
deer
among
the
bushes
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
met
no
one
on
her
way
neither
blues
nor
chouans
seeing
the
column
of
blue
smoke
which
was
rising
from
the
chimney
of
s
melancholy
dwelling
her
heart
was
seized
with
a
violent
palpitation
the
rapid
sonorous
beating
of
which
rose
to
her
throat
in
waves
she
stopped
rested
her
hand
against
a
tree
and
watched
the
smoke
which
was
serving
as
a
beacon
to
the
foes
as
well
as
to
the
friends
of
the
young
chieftain
never
had
she
felt
such
overwhelming
emotion
ah
i
love
him
too
much
she
said
with
a
sort
of
despair
perhaps
i
shall
no
longer
be
mistress
of
myself
she
hurried
over
the
distance
which
separated
her
from
the
cottage
and
reached
the
courtyard
the
filth
of
which
was
now
stiffened
by
the
frost
the
big
dog
sprang
up
barking
but
a
word
from
silenced
him
and
he
wagged
his
tail
as
she
entered
the
house
marie
gave
a
look
which
included
everything
the
marquis
was
not
there
she
breathed
more
freely
and
saw
with
pleasure
that
the
chouan
had
taken
some
pains
to
clean
the
dirty
and
only
room
in
his
hovel
he
now
took
his
bowed
silently
to
his
guest
and
left
the
house
followed
by
his
dog
marie
went
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
watched
him
as
he
took
the
path
to
the
right
of
his
hut
from
there
she
could
overlook
a
series
of
fields
the
curious
openings
to
which
formed
a
perspective
of
gates
for
the
leafless
trees
and
hedges
were
no
longer
a
barrier
to
a
full
view
of
the
country
when
the
chouan
s
broad
hat
was
out
of
sight
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
turned
round
to
look
for
the
church
at
fougeres
but
the
shed
concealed
it
she
cast
her
eyes
over
the
valley
of
the
couesnon
which
lay
before
her
like
a
vast
sheet
of
muslin
the
whiteness
of
which
still
further
dulled
a
gray
sky
laden
with
snow
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
nature
seems
dumb
and
noises
are
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
therefore
though
the
blues
and
their
contingent
were
marching
through
the
country
in
three
lines
forming
a
triangle
which
drew
together
as
they
neared
the
cottage
the
silence
was
so
profound
that
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
overcome
by
a
presentiment
which
added
a
sort
of
physical
pain
to
her
mental
torture
misfortune
was
in
the
air
at
last
in
a
spot
where
a
little
curtain
of
wood
closed
the
perspective
of
gates
she
saw
a
young
man
jumping
the
barriers
like
a
squirrel
and
running
with
astonishing
rapidity
it
is
he
she
thought
the
gars
was
dressed
as
a
chouan
with
a
musket
slung
from
his
shoulder
over
his
goatskin
and
would
have
been
quite
disguised
were
it
not
for
the
grace
of
his
movements
marie
withdrew
hastily
into
the
cottage
obeying
one
of
those
instinctive
promptings
which
are
as
little
explicable
as
fear
itself
the
young
man
was
soon
beside
her
before
the
chimney
where
a
bright
fire
was
burning
both
were
voiceless
fearing
to
look
at
each
other
or
even
to
make
a
movement
one
and
the
same
hope
united
them
the
same
doubt
it
was
agony
it
was
joy
monsieur
said
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
at
last
in
a
trembling
voice
your
safety
alone
has
brought
me
my
safety
he
said
bitterly
yes
she
answered
so
long
as
i
stay
at
fougeres
your
life
is
threatened
and
i
love
you
too
well
not
to
leave
it
i
go
leave
me
ah
dear
love
i
shall
follow
follow
me
the
blues
dear
marie
what
have
the
blues
got
to
do
with
our
love
but
it
seems
impossible
that
you
can
stay
with
me
in
france
and
still
more
impossible
that
you
should
leave
it
with
is
there
anything
impossible
to
those
who
love
ah
true
true
all
is
possible
have
i
not
the
courage
to
resign
you
for
your
what
you
could
give
yourself
to
a
hateful
being
whom
you
did
not
love
and
you
refuse
to
make
the
happiness
of
a
man
who
adores
you
whose
life
you
fill
who
swears
to
be
yours
and
yours
only
hear
me
marie
do
you
love
me
yes
she
said
then
be
you
forget
the
infamous
career
of
a
lost
woman
i
return
to
it
i
leave
you
yes
that
i
may
not
bring
upon
your
head
the
contempt
that
falls
on
mine
without
that
fear
perhaps
but
if
i
fear
nothing
can
i
be
sure
of
that
i
am
distrustful
who
could
be
otherwise
in
a
position
like
mine
if
the
love
we
inspire
can
not
last
at
least
it
should
be
complete
and
help
us
to
bear
with
joy
the
injustice
of
the
world
but
you
what
have
you
done
for
me
you
desire
me
do
you
think
that
lifts
you
above
other
men
suppose
i
bade
you
renounce
your
ideas
your
hopes
your
king
who
will
perhaps
laugh
when
he
hears
you
have
died
for
him
while
i
would
die
for
you
with
sacred
joy
or
suppose
i
should
ask
you
to
send
your
submission
to
the
first
consul
so
that
you
could
follow
me
to
paris
or
go
with
me
to
america
away
from
the
world
where
all
is
vanity
suppose
i
thus
tested
you
to
know
if
you
loved
me
for
myself
as
at
this
moment
i
love
you
to
say
all
in
a
word
if
i
wished
instead
of
rising
to
your
level
that
you
should
fall
to
mine
what
would
you
do
hush
marie
be
silent
do
not
slander
yourself
he
cried
poor
child
i
comprehend
you
if
my
first
desire
was
passion
my
passion
now
is
love
dear
soul
of
my
soul
you
are
as
noble
as
your
name
i
know
it
as
great
as
you
are
beautiful
i
am
noble
enough
i
feel
myself
great
enough
to
force
the
world
to
receive
you
is
it
because
i
foresee
in
you
the
source
of
endless
incessant
pleasure
or
because
i
find
in
your
soul
those
precious
qualities
which
make
a
man
forever
love
the
one
woman
i
do
not
know
the
cause
but
this
i
know
that
my
love
for
you
is
boundless
i
know
i
can
no
longer
live
without
you
yes
life
would
be
unbearable
unless
you
are
ever
with
ever
with
you
ah
marie
will
you
not
understand
me
you
think
to
flatter
me
by
the
offer
of
your
hand
and
name
she
said
with
apparent
haughtiness
but
looking
fixedly
at
the
marquis
as
if
to
detect
his
inmost
thought
how
do
you
know
you
would
love
me
six
months
hence
and
then
what
would
be
my
fate
no
a
mistress
is
the
only
woman
who
is
sure
of
a
man
s
heart
duty
law
society
the
interests
of
children
are
poor
auxiliaries
if
her
power
lasts
it
gives
her
joys
and
flatteries
which
make
the
trials
of
life
endurable
but
to
be
your
wife
and
become
a
drag
upon
you
rather
than
that
i
prefer
a
passing
love
and
a
true
one
though
death
and
misery
be
its
end
yes
i
could
be
a
virtuous
mother
a
devoted
wife
but
to
keep
those
instincts
firmly
in
a
woman
s
soul
the
man
must
not
marry
her
in
a
rush
of
passion
besides
how
do
i
know
that
you
will
please
me
no
i
will
not
bring
evil
upon
you
i
leave
brittany
she
said
observing
hesitation
in
his
eyes
i
return
to
fougeres
now
where
you
can
not
come
to
me
i
can
and
if
you
see
smoke
on
the
rocks
of
you
will
know
that
i
shall
be
with
you
at
night
your
lover
your
husband
what
you
will
that
i
be
to
you
i
brave
all
ah
alphonse
you
love
me
well
she
said
passionately
to
risk
your
life
before
you
give
it
to
he
did
not
answer
he
looked
at
her
and
her
eyes
fell
but
he
read
in
her
ardent
face
a
passion
equal
to
his
own
and
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
a
sort
of
madness
overcame
her
and
she
let
herself
fall
softly
on
his
breast
resolved
to
yield
to
him
and
turn
this
yielding
to
great
results
staking
upon
it
her
future
happiness
which
would
become
more
certain
if
she
came
victorious
from
this
crucial
test
but
her
head
had
scarcely
touched
her
lover
s
shoulder
when
a
slight
noise
was
heard
without
she
tore
herself
from
his
arms
as
if
suddenly
awakened
and
sprang
from
the
cottage
her
coolness
came
back
to
her
and
she
thought
of
the
situation
he
might
have
accepted
me
and
scorned
me
she
reflected
ah
if
i
could
think
that
i
would
kill
him
but
not
yet
she
added
catching
sight
of
to
whom
she
made
a
sign
which
the
soldier
was
quick
to
understand
he
turned
on
his
heel
pretending
to
have
seen
nothing
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
the
cottage
putting
her
finger
to
her
lips
to
enjoin
silence
they
are
there
she
whispered
in
a
frightened
voice
who
the
ah
must
i
die
without
one
kiss
take
it
she
said
he
caught
her
to
him
cold
and
unresisting
and
gathered
from
her
lips
a
kiss
of
horror
and
of
joy
for
while
it
was
the
first
it
might
also
be
the
last
then
they
went
together
to
the
door
and
looked
cautiously
out
the
marquis
saw
gudin
and
his
men
holding
the
paths
leading
to
the
valley
then
he
turned
to
the
line
of
gates
where
the
first
rotten
trunk
was
guarded
by
five
men
without
an
instant
s
pause
he
jumped
on
the
barrel
of
cider
and
struck
a
hole
through
the
thatch
of
the
roof
from
which
to
spring
upon
the
rocks
behind
the
house
but
he
drew
his
head
hastily
back
through
the
gap
he
had
made
for
hulot
was
on
the
height
his
retreat
was
cut
off
in
that
direction
the
marquis
turned
and
looked
at
his
mistress
who
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
for
she
heard
the
tramp
of
the
three
detachments
near
the
house
go
out
first
he
said
you
shall
save
hearing
the
words
to
her
she
went
out
and
stood
before
the
door
the
marquis
loaded
his
musket
measuring
with
his
eye
the
space
between
the
door
of
the
hut
and
the
old
rotten
trunk
where
seven
men
stood
the
gars
fired
into
their
midst
and
sprang
forward
instantly
forcing
a
passage
through
them
the
three
troops
rushed
towards
the
opening
through
which
he
had
passed
and
saw
him
running
across
the
field
with
incredible
celerity
fire
fire
a
thousand
devils
you
re
not
frenchmen
fire
i
say
called
hulot
as
he
shouted
these
words
from
the
height
above
his
men
and
gudin
s
fired
a
volley
which
was
fortunately
the
marquis
reached
the
gate
of
the
next
field
but
as
he
did
so
he
was
almost
caught
by
gudin
who
was
close
upon
his
heels
the
gars
redoubled
his
speed
nevertheless
he
and
his
pursuer
reached
the
next
barrier
together
but
the
marquis
dashed
his
musket
at
gudin
s
head
with
so
good
an
aim
that
he
stopped
his
rush
it
is
impossible
to
depict
the
anxiety
betrayed
by
marie
or
the
interest
of
hulot
and
his
troops
as
they
watched
the
scene
they
all
unconsciously
or
silently
repeated
the
gestures
which
they
saw
the
runners
making
the
gars
and
gudin
reached
the
little
wood
together
but
as
they
did
so
the
latter
stopped
and
darted
behind
a
tree
about
twenty
chouans
afraid
to
fire
at
a
distance
lest
they
should
kill
their
leader
rushed
from
the
copse
and
riddled
the
tree
with
balls
hulot
s
men
advanced
at
a
run
to
save
gudin
who
being
without
arms
retreated
from
tree
to
tree
seizing
his
opportunity
as
the
chouans
reloaded
his
danger
was
soon
over
hulot
and
the
blues
met
him
at
the
spot
where
the
marquis
had
thrown
his
musket
at
this
instant
gudin
perceived
his
adversary
sitting
among
the
trees
and
out
of
breath
and
he
left
his
comrades
firing
at
the
chouans
who
had
retreated
behind
a
lateral
hedge
slipping
round
them
he
darted
towards
the
marquis
with
the
agility
of
a
wild
animal
observing
this
manoeuvre
the
chouans
set
up
a
cry
to
warn
their
leader
then
having
fired
on
the
blues
and
their
contingent
with
the
gusto
of
poachers
they
boldly
made
a
rush
for
them
but
hulot
s
men
sprang
through
the
hedge
which
served
them
as
a
rampart
and
took
a
bloody
revenge
the
chouans
then
gained
the
road
which
skirted
the
fields
and
took
to
the
heights
which
hulot
had
committed
the
blunder
of
abandoning
before
the
blues
had
time
to
reform
the
chouans
were
entrenched
behind
the
rocks
where
they
could
fire
with
impunity
on
the
republicans
if
the
latter
made
any
attempt
to
dislodge
them
while
hulot
and
his
soldiers
went
slowly
towards
the
little
wood
to
meet
gudin
the
men
from
fougeres
busied
themselves
in
rifling
the
dead
chouans
and
dispatching
those
who
still
lived
in
this
fearful
war
neither
party
took
prisoners
the
marquis
having
made
good
his
escape
the
chouans
and
the
blues
mutually
recognized
their
respective
positions
and
the
uselessness
of
continuing
the
fight
so
that
both
sides
prepared
to
retreat
ha
ha
cried
one
of
the
fougeres
men
busy
about
the
bodies
here
s
a
bird
with
yellow
and
he
showed
his
companions
a
purse
full
of
gold
which
he
had
just
found
in
the
pocket
of
a
stout
man
dressed
in
black
what
s
this
said
another
pulling
a
breviary
from
the
dead
man
s
coat
communion
bread
he
s
a
priest
cried
the
first
man
flinging
the
breviary
on
the
ground
here
s
a
wretch
cried
a
third
finding
only
two
crowns
in
the
pockets
of
the
body
he
was
stripping
a
cheat
but
he
s
got
a
fine
pair
of
shoes
said
a
soldier
beginning
to
pull
them
off
you
can
t
have
them
unless
they
fall
to
your
share
said
the
fougeres
man
dragging
the
dead
feet
away
and
flinging
the
boots
on
a
heap
of
clothing
already
collected
another
chouan
took
charge
of
the
money
so
that
lots
might
be
drawn
as
soon
as
the
troops
were
all
assembled
when
hulot
returned
with
gudin
whose
last
attempt
to
overtake
the
gars
was
useless
as
well
as
perilous
he
found
about
a
score
of
his
own
men
and
thirty
of
the
contingent
standing
around
eleven
of
the
enemy
whose
naked
bodies
were
thrown
into
a
ditch
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
soldiers
cried
hulot
sternly
i
forbid
you
to
share
that
clothing
form
in
line
quick
commandant
said
a
soldier
pointing
to
his
shoes
at
the
points
of
which
five
bare
toes
could
be
seen
on
each
foot
all
right
about
the
money
but
those
boots
motioning
to
a
pair
of
hobnailed
boots
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
would
fit
me
like
a
do
you
want
to
put
english
shoes
on
your
feet
retorted
hulot
but
said
one
of
the
fougeres
men
respectfully
we
ve
divided
the
booty
all
through
the
i
don
t
prevent
you
civilians
from
following
your
own
ways
replied
hulot
roughly
here
gudin
here
s
a
purse
with
three
louis
said
the
officer
who
was
distributing
the
money
you
have
run
hard
and
the
commandant
won
t
prevent
your
taking
hulot
looked
askance
at
gudin
and
saw
that
he
turned
pale
it
s
my
uncle
s
purse
exclaimed
the
young
man
exhausted
as
he
was
with
his
run
he
sprang
to
the
mound
of
bodies
and
the
first
that
met
his
eyes
was
that
of
his
uncle
but
he
had
hardly
recognized
the
rubicund
face
now
furrowed
with
blue
lines
and
seen
the
stiffened
arms
and
the
gunshot
wound
before
he
gave
a
stifled
cry
exclaiming
let
us
be
off
the
blues
started
hulot
gave
his
arm
to
his
young
friend
god
s
thunder
he
cried
never
mind
it
is
no
great
but
he
is
dead
said
gudin
dead
he
was
my
only
relation
and
though
he
cursed
me
still
he
loved
me
if
the
king
returns
the
neighborhood
will
want
my
head
and
my
poor
uncle
would
have
saved
what
a
fool
gudin
is
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
stayed
behind
to
share
the
spoils
his
uncle
was
rich
and
he
hasn
t
had
time
to
make
a
will
and
disinherit
the
division
over
the
men
of
fougeres
rejoined
the
little
battalion
of
the
blues
on
their
way
to
the
town
towards
midnight
the
cottage
of
hitherto
the
scene
of
life
without
a
care
was
full
of
dread
and
horrible
anxiety
barbette
and
her
little
boy
returned
at
the
one
with
her
heavy
burden
of
rushes
the
other
carrying
fodder
for
the
cattle
entering
the
hut
they
looked
about
in
vain
for
the
miserable
chamber
never
looked
to
them
as
large
so
empty
was
it
the
fire
was
out
and
the
darkness
the
silence
seemed
to
tell
of
some
disaster
barbette
hastened
to
make
a
blaze
and
to
light
two
the
name
given
to
candles
made
of
pitch
in
the
region
between
the
villages
of
amorique
and
the
upper
loire
and
still
used
beyond
amboise
in
the
vendomois
districts
barbette
did
these
things
with
the
slowness
of
a
person
absorbed
in
one
overpowering
feeling
she
listened
to
every
sound
deceived
by
the
whistling
of
the
wind
she
went
often
to
the
door
of
the
hut
returning
sadly
she
cleaned
two
beakers
filled
them
with
cider
and
placed
them
on
the
long
table
now
and
again
she
looked
at
her
boy
who
watched
the
baking
of
the
buckwheat
cakes
but
did
not
speak
to
him
the
lad
s
eyes
happened
to
rest
on
the
nails
which
usually
held
his
father
s
and
barbette
trembled
as
she
noticed
that
the
gun
was
gone
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
lowing
of
a
cow
or
the
splash
of
the
cider
as
it
dropped
at
regular
intervals
from
the
bung
of
the
cask
the
poor
woman
sighed
while
she
poured
into
three
brown
earthenware
porringers
a
sort
of
soup
made
of
milk
biscuit
broken
into
bits
and
boiled
chestnuts
they
must
have
fought
in
the
field
next
to
the
berandiere
said
the
boy
go
and
see
replied
his
mother
the
child
ran
to
the
place
where
the
fighting
had
as
he
said
taken
place
in
the
moonlight
he
found
the
heap
of
bodies
but
his
father
was
not
among
them
and
he
came
back
whistling
joyously
having
picked
up
several
pieces
trampled
in
the
mud
and
overlooked
by
the
victors
his
mother
was
sitting
on
a
stool
beside
the
fire
employed
in
spinning
flax
he
made
a
negative
sign
to
her
and
then
ten
o
clock
having
struck
from
the
tower
of
he
went
to
bed
muttering
a
prayer
to
the
holy
virgin
of
auray
at
dawn
barbette
who
had
not
closed
her
eyes
gave
a
cry
of
joy
as
she
heard
in
the
distance
a
sound
she
knew
well
of
hobnailed
shoes
and
soon
after
s
scowling
face
presented
itself
thanks
to
he
said
to
whom
i
owe
a
candle
the
gars
is
safe
don
t
forget
that
we
now
owe
three
candles
to
the
he
seized
a
beaker
of
cider
and
emptied
it
at
a
draught
without
drawing
breath
when
his
wife
had
served
his
soup
and
taken
his
gun
and
he
himself
was
seated
on
the
wooden
bench
he
said
looking
at
the
fire
i
can
t
make
out
how
the
blues
got
here
the
fighting
was
at
florigny
who
the
devil
could
have
told
them
that
the
gars
was
in
our
house
no
one
knew
it
but
he
and
the
handsome
garce
and
we
barbette
turned
white
they
made
me
believe
they
were
the
gars
of
she
said
trembling
it
was
i
who
told
them
the
gars
was
turned
pale
himself
and
dropped
his
porringer
on
the
table
i
sent
the
boy
to
warn
you
said
barbette
frightened
didn
t
you
meet
him
the
chouan
rose
and
struck
his
wife
so
violently
that
she
dropped
pale
as
death
upon
the
bed
you
cursed
woman
he
said
you
have
killed
me
then
seized
with
remorse
he
took
her
in
his
arms
barbette
he
cried
barbette
holy
virgin
my
hand
was
too
heavy
do
you
think
she
said
opening
her
eyes
that
will
hear
of
it
the
gars
will
certainly
inquire
who
betrayed
will
he
tell
it
to
and
were
both
at
barbette
breathed
a
little
easier
if
they
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
she
cried
i
ll
rinse
their
glasses
with
ah
i
can
t
eat
said
anxiously
his
wife
set
another
pitcher
full
of
cider
before
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
it
two
big
tears
rolled
from
the
woman
s
eyes
and
moistened
the
deep
furrows
of
her
withered
face
listen
to
me
wife
morning
you
must
gather
fagots
on
the
rocks
of
to
the
right
and
and
set
fire
to
them
that
is
a
signal
agreed
upon
between
the
gars
and
the
old
rector
of
who
is
to
come
and
say
mass
for
is
the
gars
going
to
fougeres
yes
to
see
his
handsome
garce
i
have
been
sent
here
and
there
all
day
about
it
i
think
he
is
going
to
marry
her
and
carry
her
off
for
he
told
me
to
hire
horses
and
have
them
ready
on
the
road
to
thereupon
who
was
tired
out
went
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
again
departed
later
on
the
following
morning
he
returned
having
carefully
fulfilled
all
the
commissions
entrusted
to
him
by
the
gars
finding
that
and
had
not
appeared
at
the
cottage
he
relieved
the
apprehensions
of
his
wife
who
went
off
reassured
to
the
rocks
of
where
she
had
collected
the
night
before
several
piles
of
fagots
now
covered
with
hoarfrost
the
boy
went
with
her
carrying
fire
in
a
broken
wooden
shoe
hardly
had
his
wife
and
son
passed
out
of
sight
behind
the
shed
when
heard
the
noise
of
men
jumping
the
successive
barriers
and
he
could
dimly
see
through
the
fog
which
was
growing
thicker
the
forms
of
two
men
like
moving
shadows
it
is
and
he
said
mentally
then
he
shuddered
the
two
chouans
entered
the
courtyard
and
showed
their
gloomy
faces
under
the
hats
which
made
them
look
like
the
figures
which
engravers
introduce
into
their
landscapes
said
gravely
monsieur
replied
the
other
humbly
will
you
come
in
and
drink
a
drop
i
ve
some
cold
buckwheat
cake
and
that
s
not
to
be
refused
cousin
said
the
two
chouans
entered
the
cottage
so
far
there
was
nothing
alarming
for
the
master
of
the
house
who
hastened
to
fill
three
beakers
from
his
huge
cask
of
cider
while
and
sitting
on
the
polished
benches
on
each
side
of
the
long
table
cut
the
cake
and
spread
it
with
the
rich
yellow
butter
from
which
the
milk
spurted
as
the
knife
smoothed
it
placed
the
beakers
full
of
frothing
cider
before
his
guests
and
the
three
chouans
began
to
eat
but
from
time
to
time
the
master
of
the
house
cast
glances
at
as
he
drank
his
cider
lend
me
your
said
to
having
shaken
several
pinches
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
breton
inhaled
the
tobacco
like
a
man
who
is
making
ready
for
serious
business
it
is
cold
said
rising
to
shut
the
upper
half
of
the
door
the
daylight
already
dim
with
fog
now
entered
only
through
the
little
window
and
feebly
lighted
the
room
and
the
two
seats
the
fire
however
gave
out
a
ruddy
glow
refilled
the
beakers
but
his
guests
refused
to
drink
again
and
throwing
aside
their
large
hats
looked
at
him
solemnly
their
gestures
and
the
look
they
gave
him
terrified
who
fancied
he
saw
blood
in
the
red
woollen
caps
they
wore
fetch
your
axe
said
but
monsieur
what
do

want
it
for
come

well
said
pocketing
his
which
returned
to
him

two
chouans

together
and
took
their
guns
monsieur
i
never
said
one
word
about
the
gars
i
told
you
to
fetch
your
axe
said
the
hapless
man
knocked
against
the
wooden
bedstead
of
his
son
and
several
pieces
rolled
on
the
floor
picked
them
up
ho
ho
the
blues

in
new
money
cried
as
true
as

image

the
fougeres
men
for

at
a
sign
from
his
companion
helped
to
seize
the
victim
finding
himself
in
their
grasp
lost
all
power
and
fell
on
his
knees
holding
up
his
hands
to
his
slayers
in
desperation
my
friends
my
good
friends
my
cousin
he
said
what
will
become
of
my
little
boy
i
will
take
charge
of

my
good
comrades
cried
the
victim
turning
livid
i
am
not

to
die
don

make
me
go
without
confession
you

the
right
to
take
my
life

no
right
to
make
me
lose
a
blessed
that
is
true
said
addressing
the
two
chouans
waited
a
moment
in
much
uncertainty
unable
to
decide
this
case
of
conscience
listened
to
the
rustling
of
the
wind
as
though
he
still
had
hope
suddenly
took
him
by
the
arm
into
a
corner
of
the
hut
confess
your
sins
to
me
he
said
and
i
will
tell
them
to
a
priest
of
the
true
church
and
if
there
is
any
penance
to
do
i
will
do
it
for
obtained
some
respite
by
the
way
in
which
he
confessed
his
sins
but
in
spite
of
their
number
and
the
circumstances
of
each
crime
he
came
finally
to
the
end
of
them
cousin
he
said
imploringly
since
i
am
speaking
to
you
as
i
would
to
my
confessor
i
do
assure
you
by
the
holy
name
of
god
that

to
reproach
myself
with
except
for

and
then
buttered
my
bread
on
both
sides
and
i
call
on
who
is
there
over
the
to
witness
that
i
have
never
said
one
word
about
the
gars

my
good
friends
i
have
not
betrayed

good
that

behave
like
a
breton
and
be
done
with
the
two
chouans
seized
him
again
and
threw
him
on
the
bench
where
he
gave
no
other
sign
of
resistance
than
the
instinctive
and
convulsive
motions
of
an
animal
uttering
a
few
smothered
groans
which
ceased
when
the
axe
fell
the
head
was
off
at
the
first
blow
took
it
by
the
hair
left
the
room
sought
and
found
a
large
nail
in
the
rough
casing
of
the
door
and
wound
the
hair
about
it
leaving
the
bloody
head
the
eyes
of
which
he
did
not
even
close
to
hang
there
the
two
chouans
then
washed
their
hands
without
the
least
haste
in
a
pot
full
of
water
picked
up
their
hats
and
guns
and
jumped
the
gate
whistling
the
ballad
of
the
began
to
sing
in
a
hoarse
voice
as
he
reached
the
field
the
last
verses
of
that
rustic
song
their
melody
floating
on
the
breeze
at
the
first
town
her
lover
dressed
her
all
in
white
satin
at
the
next
town
her
lover
dressed
her
in
gold
and
silver
so
beautiful
was
she
they
gave
her
veils
to
wear
in
the
the
tune
became
gradually
indistinguishable
as
the
chouans
got
further
away
but
the
silence
of
the
country
was
so
great
that
several
of
the
notes
reached
barbette
s
ear
as
she
neared
home
holding
her
boy
by
the
hand
a
never
listens
coldly
to
that
song
so
popular
is
it
in
the
west
of
france
and
barbette
began
unconsciously
to
sing
the
first
verses
come
let
us
go
my
girl
let
us
go
to
the
war
let
us
go
it
is
time
brave
captain
let
it
not
trouble
you
but
my
daughter
is
not
for
you
you
shall
not
have
her
on
earth
you
shall
not
have
her
at
sea
unless
by
treachery
the
father
took
his
daughter
he
unclothed
her
and
flung
her
out
to
sea
the
captain
wiser
still
into
the
waves
he
jumped
and
to
the
shore
he
brought
her
come
let
us
go
my
girl
let
us
go
to
the
war
let
us
go
it
is
time
at
the
first
town
her
lover
dressed
her
etc
as
barbette
reached
this
verse
of
the
song
where
had
begun
it
she
was
entering
the
courtyard
of
her
home
her
tongue
suddenly
stiffened
she
stood
still
and
a
great
cry
quickly
repressed
came
from
her
gaping
lips
what
is
it
mother
said
the
child
walk
alone
she
cried
pulling
her
hand
away
and
pushing
him
roughly
you
have
neither
father
nor
the
child
who
was
rubbing
his
shoulder
and
weeping
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
thing
on
the
nail
his
childlike
face
kept
the
nervous
convulsion
his
crying
had
caused
but
he
was
silent
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
gazed
at
the
head
of
his
father
with
a
stupid
look
which
betrayed
no
emotion
then
his
face
brutalized
by
ignorance
showed
savage
curiosity
barbette
again
took
his
hand
grasped
it
violently
and
dragged
him
into
the
house
when
and
threw
their
victim
on
the
bench
one
of
his
shoes
dropping
off
fell
on
the
floor
beneath
his
neck
and
was
afterward
filled
with
blood
it
was
the
first
thing
that
met
the
widow
s
eye
take
off
your
shoe
said
the
mother
to
her
son
put
your
foot
in
that
good
remember
she
cried
in
a
solemn
voice
your
father
s
shoe
never
put
on
your
own
without
remembering
how
the
chouans
filled
it
with
his
blood
and
the
she
swayed
her
head
with
so
convulsive
an
action
that
the
meshes
of
her
black
hair
fell
upon
her
neck
and
gave
a
sinister
expression
to
her
face
i
call
to
witness
she
said
that
i
vow
you
to
the
blues
you
shall
be
a
soldier
to
avenge
your
father
kill
kill
the
and
do
as
i
do
ha
they
ve
taken
the
head
of
my
man
and
i
am
going
to
give
that
of
the
gars
to
the
she
sprang
at
a
bound
on
the
bed
seized
a
little
bag
of
money
from
a
took
the
hand
of
the
astonished
little
boy
and
dragged
him
after
her
without
giving
him
time
to
put
on
his
shoe
and
was
on
her
way
to
fougeres
rapidly
without
once
turning
her
head
to
look
at
the
home
she
abandoned
when
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
rocks
of
barbette
set
fire
to
the
pile
of
fagots
and
the
boy
helped
her
to
pile
on
the
green
gorse
damp
with
hoarfrost
to
make
the
smoke
more
dense
that
fire
will
last
longer
than
your
father
longer
than
i
longer
than
the
gars
said
barbette
in
a
savage
voice
while
the
widow
of
and
her
son
with
his
bloody
foot
stood
watching
the
one
with
a
gloomy
expression
of
revenge
the
other
with
curiosity
the
curling
of
the
smoke
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
same
rock
trying
but
in
vain
to
see
her
lover
s
signal
the
fog
which
had
thickened
buried
the
whole
region
under
a
veil
its
gray
tints
obscuring
even
the
outlines
of
the
scenery
that
was
nearest
the
town
she
examined
with
tender
anxiety
the
rocks
the
castle
the
buildings
which
loomed
like
shadows
through
the
mist
near
her
window
several
trees
stood
out
against
this
background
the
sun
gave
a
dull
tone
as
of
tarnished
silver
to
the
sky
its
rays
colored
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
where
a
few
last
leaves
were
fluttering
with
a
dingy
red
but
too
many
dear
and
delightful
sentiments
filled
marie
s
soul
to
let
her
notice
the
of
a
scene
so
out
of
harmony
with
the
joys
she
was
tasting
in
advance
for
the
last
two
days
her
ideas
had
undergone
a
change
the
fierce
undisciplined
vehemence
of
her
passions
had
yielded
under
the
influence
of
the
equable
atmosphere
which
a
true
love
gives
to
life
the
certainty
of
being
loved
sought
through
so
many
perils
had
given
birth
to
a
desire
to
those
social
conditions
which
sanction
love
and
which
despair
alone
had
made
her
leave
to
love
for
a
moment
only
now
seemed
to
her
a
species
of
weakness
she
saw
herself
lifted
from
the
dregs
of
society
where
misfortune
had
driven
her
to
the
high
rank
in
which
her
father
had
meant
to
place
her
her
vanity
repressed
for
a
time
by
the
cruel
alternations
of
hope
and
misconception
was
awakened
and
showed
her
all
the
benefits
of
a
great
position
born
in
a
certain
way
to
rank
marriage
to
a
marquis
meant
to
her
mind
living
and
acting
in
the
sphere
that
belonged
to
her
having
known
the
chances
and
changes
of
an
adventurous
life
she
could
appreciate
better
than
other
women
the
grandeur
of
the
feelings
which
make
the
family
marriage
and
motherhood
with
all
their
cares
seemed
to
her
less
a
task
than
a
rest
she
loved
the
calm
and
virtuous
life
she
saw
through
the
clouds
of
this
last
storm
as
a
woman
weary
of
virtue
may
sometimes
covet
an
illicit
passion
virtue
was
to
her
a
new
seduction
perhaps
she
thought
leaving
the
window
without
seeing
the
signal
on
the
rocks
of
i
have
been
too
coquettish
with
him
but
i
knew
he
loved
me
francine
it
is
not
a
dream
i
shall
be
marquise
de
montauran
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
perfect
happiness
oh
i
love
him
and
love
alone
is
love
s
reward
and
yet
i
think
god
means
to
recompense
me
for
taking
heart
through
all
my
misery
he
means
me
to
forget
my
sufferings
for
you
know
francine
i
have
marquise
de
montauran
you
marie
ah
until
it
is
done
i
can
not
believe
it
who
has
told
him
your
true
goodness
dear
child
he
has
more
than
his
handsome
eyes
to
see
me
with
he
has
a
soul
if
you
had
seen
him
as
i
have
in
danger
oh
he
knows
how
to
love
he
is
so
brave
if
you
really
love
him
why
do
you
let
him
come
to
fougeres
we
had
no
time
to
say
one
word
to
each
other
when
the
blues
surprised
us
besides
his
coming
is
a
proof
of
love
can
i
ever
have
proofs
enough
and
now
francine
do
my
but
she
pulled
it
down
a
score
of
times
with
motions
that
seemed
electric
as
though
some
stormy
thoughts
were
mingling
still
with
the
arts
of
her
coquetry
as
she
rolled
a
curl
or
smoothed
the
shining
plaits
she
asked
herself
with
a
remnant
of
distrust
whether
the
marquis
were
deceiving
her
but
treachery
seemed
to
her
impossible
for
did
he
not
expose
himself
to
instant
vengeance
by
entering
fougeres
while
studying
in
her
mirror
the
effects
of
a
sidelong
glance
a
smile
a
gentle
frown
an
attitude
of
anger
or
of
love
or
disdain
she
was
seeking
some
woman
s
wile
by
which
to
probe
to
the
last
instant
the
heart
of
the
young
leader
you
are
right
francine
she
said
i
wish
with
you
that
the
marriage
were
over
this
is
the
last
of
my
cloudy
days
it
is
big
with
death
or
happiness
oh
that
fog
is
dreadful
she
went
on
again
looking
towards
the
heights
of
which
were
still
veiled
in
mist
she
began
to
arrange
the
silk
and
muslin
curtains
which
draped
the
window
making
them
intercept
the
light
and
produce
in
the
room
a
voluptuous
francine
she
said
take
away
those
on
the
mantelpiece
leave
only
the
clock
and
the
two
dresden
vases
i
ll
fill
those
vases
myself
with
the
flowers
corentin
brought
me
take
out
the
chairs
i
want
only
this
sofa
and
a
fauteuil
then
sweep
the
carpet
so
as
to
bring
out
the
colors
and
put
wax
candles
in
the
sconces
and
on
the
marie
looked
long
and
carefully
at
the
old
tapestry
on
the
walls
guided
by
her
innate
taste
she
found
among
the
brilliant
tints
of
these
hangings
the
shades
by
which
to
connect
their
antique
beauty
with
the
furniture
and
accessories
of
the
boudoir
either
by
the
harmony
of
color
or
the
charm
of
contrast
the
same
thought
guided
the
arrangement
of
the
flowers
with
which
she
filled
the
twisted
vases
which
decorated
her
chamber
the
sofa
was
placed
beside
the
fire
on
either
side
of
the
bed
which
filled
the
space
parallel
to
that
of
the
chimney
she
placed
on
gilded
tables
tall
dresden
vases
filled
with
foliage
and
flowers
that
were
sweetly
fragrant
she
quivered
more
than
once
as
she
arranged
the
folds
of
the
green
damask
above
the
bed
and
studied
the
fall
of
the
drapery
which
concealed
it
such
preparations
have
a
secret
ineffable
happiness
about
them
they
cause
so
many
delightful
emotions
that
a
woman
as
she
makes
them
forgets
her
doubts
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
forgot
hers
there
is
in
truth
a
religious
sentiment
in
the
multiplicity
of
cares
taken
for
one
beloved
who
is
not
there
to
see
them
and
reward
them
but
who
will
reward
them
later
with
the
approving
smile
these
tender
preparations
always
so
fully
understood
obtain
women
as
they
make
them
love
in
advance
and
there
are
few
indeed
who
would
not
say
to
themselves
as
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
now
thought
i
shall
be
happy
that
soft
hope
lies
in
every
fold
of
silk
or
muslin
insensibly
the
harmony
the
woman
makes
about
her
gives
an
atmosphere
of
love
in
which
she
breathes
to
her
these
things
are
beings
witnesses
she
has
made
them
the
sharers
of
her
coming
joy
every
movement
every
thought
brings
that
joy
within
her
grasp
but
presently
she
expects
no
longer
she
hopes
no
more
she
questions
silence
the
slightest
sound
is
to
her
an
omen
doubt
hooks
its
claws
once
more
into
her
heart
she
burns
she
trembles
she
is
grasped
by
a
thought
which
holds
her
like
a
physical
force
she
alternates
from
triumph
to
agony
and
without
the
hope
of
coming
happiness
she
could
not
endure
the
torture
a
score
of
times
did
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
raise
the
hoping
to
see
the
smoke
rising
above
the
rocks
but
the
fog
only
took
a
grayer
tone
which
her
excited
imagination
turned
into
a
warning
at
last
she
let
fall
the
curtain
impatiently
resolving
not
to
raise
it
again
she
looked
gloomily
around
the
charming
room
to
which
she
had
given
a
soul
and
a
voice
asking
herself
if
it
were
done
in
vain
and
this
thought
brought
her
back
to
her
preparations
francine
she
said
drawing
her
into
a
little
which
adjoined
her
chamber
and
was
lighted
through
a
small
round
window
opening
on
a
dark
corner
of
the
fortifications
where
they
joined
the
rock
terrace
of
the
promenade
put
everything
in
order
as
for
the
salon
you
can
leave
that
as
it
is
she
added
with
a
smile
which
women
reserve
for
their
nearest
friends
the
delicate
sentiment
of
which
men
seldom
understand
ah
how
sweet
you
are
exclaimed
the
little
maid
a
lover
is
our
beauty
foolish
women
that
we
are
she
replied
gaily
francine
left
her
lying
on
the
ottoman
and
went
away
convinced
that
whether
her
mistress
were
loved
or
not
she
would
never
betray
montauran
are
you
sure
of
what
you
are
telling
me
old
woman
hulot
was
saying
to
barbette
who
had
sought
him
out
as
soon
as
she
had
reached
fougeres
have
you
got
eyes
look
at
the
rocks
of
there
my
good
man
to
the
right
of
corentin
who
was
with
hulot
looked
towards
the
summit
in
the
direction
pointed
out
by
barbette
and
as
the
fog
was
beginning
to
lift
he
could
see
with
some
distinctness
the
column
of
white
smoke
the
woman
told
of
but
when
is
he
coming
old
woman
or
this
evening
my
good
man
said
barbette
i
don
t
why
do
you
betray
your
own
side
said
hulot
quickly
having
drawn
her
out
of
hearing
of
corentin
ah
general
see
my
boy
s
foot
that
s
washed
in
the
blood
of
my
man
whom
the
chouans
have
killed
like
a
calf
to
punish
him
for
the
few
words
you
got
out
of
me
the
other
day
when
i
was
working
in
the
fields
take
my
boy
for
you
ve
deprived
him
of
his
father
and
his
mother
make
a
blue
of
him
my
good
man
teach
him
to
kill
chouans
here
there
s
two
hundred
crowns
keep
them
for
him
if
he
is
careful
they
ll
last
him
long
for
it
took
his
father
twelve
years
to
lay
them
hulot
looked
with
amazement
at
the
pale
and
withered
woman
whose
eyes
were
dry
but
you
mother
he
said
what
will
become
of
you
you
had
better
keep
the
i
she
replied
shaking
her
head
sadly
i
don
t
need
anything
in
this
world
you
might
bolt
me
into
that
highest
tower
over
there
pointing
to
the
battlements
of
the
castle
and
the
chouans
would
contrive
to
come
and
kill
she
kissed
her
boy
with
an
awful
expression
of
grief
looked
at
him
wiped
away
her
tears
looked
at
him
again
and
disappeared
commandant
said
corentin
this
is
an
occasion
when
two
heads
are
better
than
one
we
know
all
and
yet
we
know
nothing
if
you
surrounded
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
house
now
you
will
only
warn
her
neither
you
nor
i
nor
your
blues
and
your
battalions
are
strong
enough
to
get
the
better
of
that
girl
if
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
save
the
the
fellow
is
brave
and
consequently
wily
he
is
a
young
man
full
of
daring
we
can
never
get
hold
of
him
as
he
enters
fougeres
perhaps
he
is
here
already
domiciliary
visit
absurdity
that
s
no
good
it
will
only
give
them
well
said
hulot
impatiently
i
shall
tell
the
sentry
on
the
place
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
house
and
pass
word
along
the
other
sentinels
if
a
young
man
enters
it
as
soon
as
the
signal
reaches
me
i
shall
take
a
corporal
and
four
men
and
and
said
corentin
interrupting
the
old
soldier
if
the
young
man
is
not
the
marquis
or
if
the
marquis
doesn
t
go
in
by
the
front
door
or
if
he
is
already
there
if
if
if
what
then
corentin
looked
at
the
commandant
with
so
insulting
an
air
of
superiority
that
the
old
soldier
shouted
out
god
s
thousand
thunders
get
out
of
here
citizen
of
hell
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
your
intrigues
if
that
cockchafer
buzzes
into
my
i
shall
shoot
him
if
i
hear
he
is
in
a
house
i
shall
surround
that
house
and
take
him
when
he
leaves
it
and
shoot
him
but
may
the
devil
get
me
if
i
soil
my
uniform
with
any
of
your
commandant
the
order
of
the
ministers
states
that
you
are
to
obey
mademoiselle
de
let
her
come
and
give
them
to
me
herself
and
i
ll
see
about
well
citizen
said
corentin
haughtily
she
shall
come
she
shall
tell
you
herself
the
hour
at
which
she
expects
the
possibly
she
won
t
be
easy
till
you
do
post
the
sentinels
round
the
the
devil
is
made
man
thought
the
old
leader
as
he
watched
corentin
hurrying
up
the
queen
s
staircase
at
the
foot
of
which
this
scene
had
taken
place
he
means
to
deliver
montauran
bound
hand
and
foot
with
no
chance
to
fight
for
his
life
and
i
shall
be
harrassed
to
death
with
a
however
he
added
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
gars
certainly
is
an
enemy
of
the
republic
and
he
killed
my
poor
gerard
and
his
death
will
make
a
noble
the
less
the
devil
take
him
he
turned
on
the
heels
of
his
boots
and
went
off
whistling
the
marseillaise
to
inspect
his
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
absorbed
in
one
of
those
meditations
the
mysteries
of
which
are
buried
in
the
soul
and
prove
by
their
thousand
contradictory
emotions
to
the
woman
who
undergoes
them
that
it
is
possible
to
have
a
stormy
and
passionate
existence
between
four
walls
without
even
moving
from
the
ottoman
on
which
her
very
life
is
burning
itself
away
she
had
reached
the
final
scene
of
the
drama
she
had
come
to
enact
and
her
mind
was
going
over
and
over
the
phases
of
love
and
anger
which
had
so
powerfully
stirred
her
during
the
ten
days
which
had
now
elapsed
since
her
first
meeting
with
the
marquis
a
man
s
step
suddenly
sounded
in
the
adjoining
room
and
she
trembled
the
door
opened
she
turned
quickly
and
saw
corentin
you
little
cheat
said
the
when
will
you
stop
deceiving
ah
marie
marie
you
are
playing
a
dangerous
game
by
not
taking
me
into
your
confidence
why
do
you
play
such
tricks
without
consulting
me
if
the
marquis
escapes
his
fate
it
won
t
be
your
fault
will
it
she
replied
sarcastically
monsieur
she
continued
in
a
grave
voice
by
what
right
do
you
come
into
my
house
your
house
he
exclaimed
you
remind
me
she
answered
coldly
that
i
have
no
home
perhaps
you
chose
this
house
deliberately
for
the
purpose
of
committing
murder
i
shall
leave
it
i
would
live
in
a
desert
to
get
away
from
spies
say
the
word
interrupted
corentin
but
this
house
is
neither
yours
nor
mine
it
belongs
to
the
government
and
as
for
leaving
it
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
added
giving
her
a
diabolical
look
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
rose
indignantly
made
a
few
steps
to
leave
the
room
but
stopped
short
suddenly
as
corentin
raised
the
curtain
of
the
window
and
beckoned
her
with
a
smile
to
come
to
him
do
you
see
that
column
of
smoke
he
asked
with
the
calmness
he
always
kept
on
his
livid
face
however
intense
his
feelings
might
be
what
has
my
departure
to
do
with
that
burning
brush
she
asked
why
does
your
voice
tremble
he
said
you
poor
thing
he
added
in
a
gentle
voice
i
know
all
the
marquis
is
coming
to
fougeres
this
evening
and
it
is
not
with
any
intention
of
delivering
him
to
us
that
you
have
arranged
this
boudoir
and
the
flowers
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
turned
pale
for
she
saw
her
lover
s
death
in
the
eyes
of
this
tiger
with
a
human
face
and
her
love
for
him
rose
to
frenzy
each
hair
on
her
head
caused
her
an
acute
pain
she
could
not
endure
and
she
fell
on
the
ottoman
corentin
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
with
his
arms
folded
half
pleased
at
inflicting
a
torture
which
avenged
him
for
the
contempt
and
the
sarcasms
this
woman
had
heaped
upon
his
head
half
grieved
by
the
sufferings
of
a
creature
whose
yoke
was
pleasant
to
him
heavy
as
it
was
she
loves
him
he
muttered
loves
him
she
cried
ah
what
are
words
corentin
he
is
my
life
my
soul
my
breath
she
flung
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
man
whose
silence
terrified
her
soul
of
vileness
she
cried
i
would
rather
degrade
myself
to
save
his
life
than
degrade
myself
by
betraying
him
i
will
save
him
at
the
cost
of
my
own
blood
speak
what
price
must
i
pay
you
corentin
quivered
i
came
to
take
your
orders
marie
he
said
raising
her
yes
marie
your
insults
will
not
hinder
my
devotion
to
your
wishes
provided
you
will
promise
not
to
deceive
me
again
you
must
know
by
this
time
that
no
one
dupes
me
with
if
you
want
me
to
love
you
corentin
help
me
to
save
at
what
hour
is
he
coming
asked
the
spy
endeavoring
to
ask
the
question
calmly
alas
i
do
not
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
i
am
lost
thought
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
she
is
deceiving
me
thought
corentin
marie
he
continued
i
have
two
maxims
one
is
never
to
believe
a
single
word
a
woman
says
to
me
that
s
the
only
means
of
not
being
duped
the
other
is
to
find
what
interest
she
has
in
doing
the
opposite
of
what
she
says
and
behaving
in
contradiction
to
the
facts
she
pretends
to
confide
to
me
i
think
that
you
and
i
understand
each
other
perfectly
replied
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
you
want
proofs
of
my
good
faith
but
i
reserve
them
for
the
time
when
you
give
me
some
of
adieu
mademoiselle
said
corentin
coolly
nonsense
said
the
girl
smiling
sit
down
and
pray
don
t
sulk
but
if
you
do
i
shall
know
how
to
save
the
marquis
without
you
as
for
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
which
are
always
spread
before
your
eyes
i
will
give
them
to
you
in
good
gold
as
soon
as
the
marquis
is
corentin
rose
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
and
looked
at
marie
you
have
grown
rich
in
a
very
short
time
he
said
in
a
tone
of
bitterness
montauran
she
continued
will
make
you
a
better
offer
still
for
his
ransom
now
then
prove
to
me
that
you
have
the
means
of
guaranteeing
him
from
all
danger
and
can
t
you
send
him
away
the
moment
he
arrives
cried
corentin
suddenly
hulot
does
not
know
he
is
coming
and
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
said
too
much
but
how
absurd
that
you
should
ask
me
how
to
play
a
trick
he
said
with
an
easy
laugh
now
listen
marie
i
do
feel
certain
of
your
loyalty
promise
me
a
compensation
for
all
i
lose
in
furthering
your
wishes
and
i
will
make
that
old
fool
of
a
commandant
so
unsuspicious
that
the
marquis
will
be
as
safe
at
fougeres
as
at
yes
i
promise
it
said
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
solemnity
no
not
in
that
way
he
said
swear
it
by
your
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
shuddered
raising
a
trembling
hand
she
made
the
oath
required
by
the
man
whose
tone
to
her
had
changed
so
suddenly
you
can
command
me
he
said
don
t
deceive
me
again
and
you
shall
have
reason
to
bless
me
i
will
trust
you
corentin
cried
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
much
moved
she
bowed
her
head
gently
towards
him
and
smiled
with
a
kindness
not
unmixed
with
surprise
as
she
saw
an
expression
of
melancholy
tenderness
on
his
face
what
an
enchanting
creature
thought
corentin
as
he
left
the
house
shall
i
ever
get
her
as
a
means
to
fortune
and
a
source
of
delight
to
fling
herself
at
my
feet
oh
yes
the
marquis
shall
die
if
i
can
t
get
that
woman
in
any
other
way
than
by
dragging
her
through
the
mud
i
ll
sink
her
in
it
at
any
rate
he
thought
as
he
reached
the
square
unconscious
of
his
steps
she
no
longer
distrusts
me
three
hundred
thousand
francs
down
she
thinks
me
grasping
either
the
offer
was
a
trick
or
she
is
already
married
to
corentin
buried
in
thought
was
unable
to
come
to
a
resolution
the
fog
which
the
sun
had
dispersed
at
was
now
rolling
thicker
and
thicker
so
that
he
could
hardly
see
the
trees
at
a
little
distance
that
s
another
piece
of
he
muttered
as
he
turned
slowly
homeward
it
is
impossible
to
see
ten
feet
the
weather
protects
the
lovers
how
is
one
to
watch
a
house
in
such
a
fog
who
goes
there
he
cried
catching
the
arm
of
a
boy
who
seemed
to
have
clambered
up
the
dangerous
rocks
which
made
the
terrace
of
the
promenade
it
is
i
said
a
childish
voice
ah
the
boy
with
the
bloody
foot
do
you
want
to
revenge
your
father
said
corentin
yes
said
the
child
very
good
do
you
know
the
gars
good
again
now
don
t
leave
me
except
to
do
what
i
bid
you
and
you
will
obey
your
mother
and
earn
some
big
sous
do
you
like
sous
you
like
sous
and
you
want
to
kill
the
gars
who
killed
your
father
well
i
ll
take
care
of
you
ah
marie
he
muttered
after
a
pause
you
yourself
shall
betray
him
as
you
engaged
to
do
she
is
too
violent
to
suspect
me
passion
never
reflects
she
does
not
know
the
marquis
s
writing
yes
i
can
set
a
trap
into
which
her
nature
will
drive
her
headlong
but
i
must
first
see
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
and
francine
were
deliberating
on
the
means
of
saving
the
marquis
from
the
more
than
doubtful
generosity
of
corentin
and
hulot
s
bayonets
i
could
go
and
warn
him
said
the
breton
girl
but
we
don
t
know
where
he
is
replied
marie
even
i
with
the
instincts
of
love
could
never
find
after
making
and
rejecting
a
number
of
plans
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
exclaimed
when
i
see
him
his
danger
will
inspire
she
thought
like
other
ardent
souls
to
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
trusting
to
her
star
or
to
that
instinct
of
adroitness
which
rarely
if
ever
fails
a
woman
perhaps
her
heart
was
never
so
wrung
at
times
she
seemed
stupefied
her
eyes
were
fixed
and
then
at
the
least
noise
she
shook
like
a
tree
which
the
woodsman
drags
with
a
rope
to
hasten
its
fall
suddenly
a
loud
report
from
a
dozen
guns
echoed
from
a
distance
marie
turned
pale
and
grasped
francine
s
hand
i
am
dying
she
cried
they
have
killed
him
the
heavy
footfall
of
a
man
was
heard
in
the
antechamber
francine
went
out
and
returned
with
a
corporal
the
man
making
a
military
salute
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
produced
some
letters
the
covers
of
which
were
a
good
deal
soiled
receiving
no
acknowledgment
the
blue
said
as
he
withdrew
madame
they
are
from
the
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
a
prey
to
horrible
presentiments
read
a
letter
written
apparently
in
great
haste
by
hulot
mademoiselle
a
party
of
my
men
have
just
caught
a
messenger
from
the
gars
and
have
shot
him
among
the
intercepted
letters
is
one
which
may
be
useful
to
you
and
i
transmit
it
thank
god
it
was
not
he
they
shot
she
exclaimed
flinging
the
letter
into
the
fire
she
breathed
more
freely
and
took
up
the
other
letter
enclosed
by
hulot
it
was
apparently
written
to
madame
du
gua
by
the
marquis
no
my
angel
the
letter
said
i
can
not
go
to
la
vivetiere
you
must
lose
your
wager
with
the
count
i
triumph
over
the
republic
in
the
person
of
their
beautiful
emissary
you
must
allow
that
she
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
one
night
it
will
be
my
only
victory
in
this
campaign
for
i
have
received
the
news
that
la
vendee
surrenders
i
can
do
nothing
more
in
france
let
us
go
back
to
england
but
we
will
talk
of
all
this
the
letter
fell
from
marie
s
hands
she
closed
her
eyes
and
was
silent
leaning
backward
with
her
head
on
a
cushion
after
a
long
pause
she
looked
at
the
clock
which
then
marked
four
in
the
afternoon
my
lord
keeps
me
waiting
she
said
with
savage
irony
oh
god
grant
he
may
not
come
cried
francine
if
he
does
not
come
said
marie
in
a
stifled
tone
i
shall
go
to
him
no
no
he
will
soon
be
here
francine
do
i
look
well
you
are
very
ah
continued
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
glancing
about
her
this
perfumed
room
the
flowers
the
lights
this
intoxicating
air
it
is
full
of
that
celestial
life
of
which
i
dreamed
marie
what
has
happened
i
am
betrayed
deceived
insulted
fooled
i
will
kill
him
i
will
tear
him
bit
by
bit
yes
there
was
always
in
his
manner
a
contempt
he
could
not
hide
and
which
i
would
not
see
oh
i
shall
die
of
this
fool
that
i
am
she
went
on
laughing
he
is
coming
i
have
one
night
in
which
to
teach
him
that
married
or
not
the
man
who
has
possessed
me
can
not
abandon
me
i
will
measure
my
vengeance
by
his
offence
he
shall
die
with
despair
in
his
soul
i
did
believe
he
had
a
soul
of
honor
but
no
it
is
that
of
a
lackey
ah
he
has
cleverly
deceived
me
for
even
now
it
seems
impossible
that
the
man
who
abandoned
me
to
should
sink
to
such
tricks
it
is
so
base
to
deceive
a
loving
woman
for
it
is
so
easy
he
might
have
killed
me
if
he
chose
but
lie
to
me
to
me
who
held
him
in
my
thoughts
so
high
the
scaffold
the
scaffold
ah
could
i
only
see
him
guillotined
am
i
cruel
he
shall
go
to
his
death
covered
with
caresses
with
kisses
which
might
have
blessed
him
for
a
lifetime
marie
said
francine
gently
be
the
victim
of
your
lover
like
other
women
not
his
mistress
and
his
betrayer
keep
his
memory
in
your
heart
do
not
make
it
an
anguish
to
you
if
there
were
no
joys
in
hopeless
love
what
would
become
of
us
poor
women
that
we
are
god
of
whom
you
never
think
marie
will
reward
us
for
obeying
our
vocation
on
this
earth
to
love
and
dear
replied
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
taking
francine
s
hand
and
patting
it
your
voice
is
very
sweet
and
persuasive
reason
is
attractive
from
your
lips
i
should
like
to
obey
you
but
you
will
forgive
him
you
will
not
betray
him
hush
never
speak
of
that
man
again
compared
with
him
corentin
is
a
noble
being
do
you
hear
me
she
rose
hiding
beneath
a
face
that
was
horribly
calm
the
madness
of
her
soul
and
a
thirst
for
vengeance
the
slow
and
measured
step
with
which
she
left
the
room
conveyed
the
sense
of
an
irrevocable
resolution
lost
in
thought
hugging
her
insults
too
proud
to
show
the
slightest
suffering
she
went
to
the
at
the
porte
and
asked
where
the
commandant
lived
she
had
hardly
left
her
house
when
corentin
entered
it
oh
monsieur
corentin
cried
francine
if
you
are
interested
in
this
young
man
save
him
mademoiselle
has
gone
to
give
him
up
because
of
this
wretched
corentin
took
the
letter
carelessly
and
asked
which
way
did
she
go
i
don
t
yes
he
said
i
will
save
her
from
her
own
he
disappeared
taking
the
letter
with
him
when
he
reached
the
street
he
said
to
s
boy
whom
he
had
stationed
to
watch
the
door
which
way
did
a
lady
go
who
left
the
house
just
now
the
boy
went
with
him
a
little
way
and
showed
him
the
steep
street
which
led
to
the
porte
that
way
he
said
at
this
moment
four
men
entered
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
house
unseen
by
either
the
boy
or
corentin
return
to
your
watch
said
the
latter
play
with
the
handles
of
the
blinds
and
see
what
you
can
inside
look
about
you
everywhere
even
on
the
corentin
darted
rapidly
in
the
direction
given
him
and
thought
he
recognized
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
through
the
fog
he
did
in
fact
overtake
her
just
as
she
reached
the
where
are
you
going
he
said
you
are
pale
what
has
happened
is
it
right
for
you
to
be
out
alone
take
my
where
is
the
commandant
she
asked
hardly
had
the
words
left
her
lips
when
she
heard
the
movement
of
troops
beyond
the
porte
and
distinguished
hulot
s
gruff
voice
in
the
tumult
god
s
thunder
he
cried
i
never
saw
such
fog
as
this
for
a
reconnaissance

mademoiselle
de
verneuil
grasping
his
arm
the
fog
will
cover
vengeance
as
well
as
perfidy

she
added
in
a
low
voice
you
must
take
measures
at
once
so
that
the
gars
may
not
escape
is
he
at
your
house
he
asked
in
a
tone
which
showed
his
amazement
not
yet
she
replied
but

me
a
safe
man
and
i
will
send
him
to
you
when
the
marquis
that

a
mistake
said

mademoiselle

fog
which
you
are
cursing

surround
my
house

soldiers
everywhere
place
a
guard
in
the
church
to
command
the
esplanade
on
which
the
windows
of
my
salon
open
post
men
on
the
promenade
for
though
the
windows
of
my
bedroom
are
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
despair
does
sometimes
give
a
man
the
power
to
jump
even
greater
distances
safely
listen
to
what
i
say
i
shall
probably
send
this
gentleman
out
of
the
door
of
my
house
therefore
see
that
only
brave
men
are
there
to
meet
him
for
she
added
with
a
sigh
no
one
denies
him
courage
he
will
assuredly
defend
gudin
called
the
commandant
listen
my
lad
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
when
the
young
man
joined
him
this
devil
of
a
girl
is
betraying
the
gars
to
us
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
why
but
that
s
no
matter
take
ten
men
and
place
yourself
so
as
to
hold
the
in
which
the
house
stands
be
careful
that
no
one
sees
either
you
or
your
yes
commandant
i
know
the
very
good
said
hulot
i
ll
send
to
let
you
know
when
to
play
your
sabres
try
to
meet
the
marquis
yourself
and
if
you
can
manage
to
kill
him
so
that
i
sha
n
t
have
to
shoot
him
judicially
you
shall
be
a
lieutenant
in
a
fortnight
or
my
name
s
not
gudin
departed
with
a
dozen
soldiers
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
said
corentin
to
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
in
a
low
voice
she
made
no
answer
but
looked
with
a
sort
of
satisfaction
at
the
men
who
were
starting
under
command
of
the
for
the
promenade
while
others
following
the
next
orders
given
by
hulot
were
to
post
themselves
in
the
shadows
of
the
church
of
there
are
houses
adjoining
mine
she
said
you
had
better
surround
them
all
don
t
lay
up
regrets
by
neglecting
a
single
she
is
mad
thought
hulot
was
i
not
a
prophet
asked
corentin
in
his
ear
as
for
the
boy
i
shall
send
with
her
he
is
the
little
gars
with
a
bloody
foot
therefore
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
for
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
by
a
sudden
movement
darted
in
the
direction
of
her
house
whither
he
followed
her
whistling
like
a
man
supremely
satisfied
when
he
overtook
her
she
was
already
at
the
door
of
her
house
where
s
little
boy
was
on
the
watch
mademoiselle
said
corentin
take
the
lad
with
you
you
can
not
have
a
more
innocent
or
active
emissary
boy
he
added
when
you
have
seen
the
gars
enter
the
house
come
to
me
no
matter
who
stops
you
you
ll
find
me
at
the
and
i
ll
give
you
something
that
will
make
you
eat
cake
for
the
rest
of
your
at
these
words
breathed
rather
than
said
in
the
child
s
ear
corentin
felt
his
hand
squeezed
by
that
of
the
little
breton
who
followed
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
into
the
house
now
my
good
friends
you
can
come
to
an
explanation
as
soon
as
you
like
cried
corentin
when
the
door
was
closed
if
you
make
love
my
little
marquis
it
will
be
on
your
but
corentin
could
not
bring
himself
to
let
that
fatal
house
completely
out
of
sight
and
he
went
to
the
promenade
where
he
found
the
commandant
giving
his
last
orders
by
this
time
it
was
night
two
hours
went
by
but
the
sentinels
posted
at
intervals
noticed
nothing
that
led
them
to
suppose
the
marquis
had
evaded
the
triple
line
of
men
who
surrounded
the
three
sides
by
which
the
tower
of
papegaut
was
accessible
twenty
times
had
corentin
gone
from
the
promenade
to
the
always
to
find
that
his
little
emissary
had
not
appeared
sunk
in
thought
the
spy
paced
the
promenade
slowly
enduring
the
martyrdom
to
which
three
passions
terrible
in
their
clashing
subject
a
man
love
avarice
and
ambition
eight
o
clock
struck
from
all
the
towers
in
the
town
the
moon
rose
late
fog
and
darkness
wrapped
in
impenetrable
gloom
the
places
where
the
drama
planned
by
this
man
was
coming
to
its
climax
he
was
able
to
silence
the
struggle
of
his
passions
as
he
walked
up
and
down
his
arms
crossed
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
windows
which
rose
like
the
luminous
eyes
of
a
phantom
above
the
rampart
the
deep
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
rippling
of
the
nancon
by
the
regular
and
lugubrious
tolling
from
the
belfries
by
the
heavy
steps
of
the
sentinels
or
the
rattle
of
arms
as
the
guard
was
hourly
relieved
the
night
s
as
thick
as
a
wolf
s
jaw
said
the
voice
of
go
on
growled
and
don
t
talk
more
than
a
dead
i
m
hardly
breathing
said
the
chouan
if
the
man
who
made
that
stone
roll
down
wants
his
heart
to
serve
as
the
scabbard
for
my
knife
he
ll
do
it
again
said
in
a
low
voice
scarcely
heard
above
the
flowing
of
the
river
it
was
i
said
well
then
old
down
on
your
stomach
said
the
other
and
wriggle
like
a
snake
through
a
hedge
or
we
shall
leave
our
carcasses
behind
us
sooner
than
we
hey
said
the
incorrigible
who
was
using
his
hands
to
drag
himself
along
on
his
stomach
and
had
reached
the
level
of
his
comrade
s
ear
if
the
is
to
be
believed
there
ll
be
a
fine
booty
will
you
go
shares
with
me
look
here
said
stopping
short
on
the
flat
of
his
stomach
the
other
chouans
who
were
accompanying
the
two
men
did
the
same
so
wearied
were
they
with
the
difficulties
they
had
met
with
in
climbing
the
precipice
i
know
you
continued
for
a
jack
who
would
rather
give
blows
than
receive
them
when
there
s
nothing
else
to
be
done
we
have
not
come
here
to
grab
dead
men
s
shoes
we
are
devils
against
devils
and
sorrow
to
those
whose
claws
are
too
short
the
has
sent
us
here
to
save
the
gars

is
up
there

your
dog
s
nose
and
see
that
window
above
the
midnight
was
striking
the
moon
rose
giving
the
appearance
of
white
smoke
to
the
fog
squeezed
s
arm
and
silently
showed
him
on
the
terrace
just
above
them
the
triangular
iron
of
several
shining
bayonets
the
blues
are
there
already
said
we
sha
n
t
gain
anything
by
patience
replied
if
i
examined
right
this
morning
we
must
be
at
the
foot
of
the
papegaut
tower
between
the
ramparts
and
the
promenade
that
place
where
they
put
the
manure
it
is
like
a
to
fall
if
remarked
would
only
change
into
cider
the
blood
we
shall
shed
the
citizens
might
lay
in
a
good
stock
laid
his
large
hand
over
his
friend
s
mouth
then
an
order
muttered
by
him
went
from
rank
to
rank
of
the
chouans
suspended
as
they
were
in
among
the
brambles
of
the
slate
rocks
corentin
walking
up
and
down
the
esplanade
had
too
practiced
an
ear
not
to
hear
the
rustling
of
the
shrubs
and
the
light
sound
of
pebbles
rolling
down
the
sides
of
the
precipice
who
seemed
to
possess
the
gift
of
seeing
in
darkness
and
whose
senses
continually
in
action
were
acute
as
those
of
a
savage
saw
corentin
like
a
trained
dog
he
had
scented
him
fouche
s
diplomatist
listened
but
heard
nothing
he
looked
at
the
natural
wall
of
rock
and
saw
no
signs
if
the
confusing
gleam
of
the
fog
enabled
him
to
see
here
and
there
a
crouching
chouan
he
took
him
no
doubt
for
a
fragment
of
rock
for
these
human
bodies
had
all
the
appearance
of
inert
nature
this
danger
to
the
invaders
was
of
short
duration
corentin
s
attention
was
diverted
by
a
very
distinct
noise
coming
from
the
other
end
of
the
promenade
where
the
rock
wall
ended
and
a
steep
descent
leading
down
to
the
queen
s
staircase
began
when
corentin
reached
the
spot
he
saw
a
figure
gliding
past
it
as
if
by
magic
putting
out
his
hand
to
grasp
this
real
or
fantastic
being
who
was
there
he
supposed
with
no
good
intentions
he
encountered
the
soft
and
rounded
figure
of
a
woman
the
devil
take
you
he
exclaimed
if
any
one
else
had
met
you
you
d
have
had
a
ball
through
your
head
what
are
you
doing
and
where
are
you
going
at
this
time
of
night
are
you
dumb
it
certainly
is
a
woman
he
said
to
himself
the
silence
was
suspicious
but
the
stranger
broke
it
by
saying
in
a
voice
which
suggested
extreme
fright
ah
my
good
man
i
m
on
my
way
back
from
a
it
is
the
pretended
mother
of
the
marquis
thought
corentin
i
ll
see
what
she
s
about
well
go
that
way
old
woman
he
replied
feigning
not
to
recognize
her
keep
to
the
left
if
you
don
t
want
to
be
he
stood
quite
still
then
observing
that
madame
du
gua
was
making
for
the
papegaut
tower
he
followed
her
at
a
distance
with
diabolical
caution
during
this
fatal
encounter
the
chouans
had
posted
themselves
on
the
manure
towards
which
had
guided
them
there
s
the
thought
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
against
the
tower
wall
like
a
bear
we
are
here
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
good
she
replied
there
s
a
ladder
in
the
garden
of
that
house
about
six
feet
above
the
manure
find
it
and
the
gars
is
saved
do
you
see
that
small
window
up
there
it
is
in
the
you
must
get
to
it
this
side
of
the
tower
is
the
only
one
not
watched
the
horses
are
ready
if
you
can
hold
the
passage
over
the
nancon
a
quarter
of
an
hour
will
put
him
out
of
danger
in
spite
of
his
folly
but
if
that
woman
tries
to
follow
him
stab
corentin
now
saw
several
of
the
forms
he
had
hitherto
supposed
to
be
stones
moving
cautiously
but
swiftly
he
went
at
once
to
the
at
the
porte
where
he
found
the
commandant
fully
dressed
and
sound
asleep
on
a
camp
bed
let
him
alone
said
roughly
he
has
only
just
lain
the
chouans
are
here
cried
corentin
in
hulot
s
ear
impossible
but
so
much
the
better
cried
the
old
soldier
still
half
asleep
then
he
can
when
hulot
reached
the
promenade
corentin
pointed
out
to
him
the
singular
position
taken
by
the
chouans
they
must
have
deceived
or
strangled
the
sentries
i
placed
between
the
castle
and
the
queen
s
staircase
ah
what
a
devil
of
a
fog
however
patience
i
ll
send
a
squad
of
men
under
a
lieutenant
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
there
is
no
use
attacking
them
where
they
are
for
those
animals
are
so
hard
they
d
let
themselves
roll
down
the
precipice
without
breaking
a
the
cracked
clock
of
the
belfry
was
ringing
two
when
the
commandant
got
back
to
the
promenade
after
giving
these
orders
and
taking
every
military
precaution
to
seize
the
chouans
the
sentries
were
doubled
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
s
house
became
the
centre
of
a
little
army
hulot
found
corentin
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
window
which
overlooked
the
tower
citizen
said
the
commandant
i
think
the
has
fooled
us
there
s
nothing
he
is
there
cried
corentin
pointing
to
the
window
i
have
seen
a
man
s
shadow
on
the
curtain
but
i
can
t
think
what
has
become
of
that
boy
they
must
have
killed
him
or
locked
him
up
there
commandant
don
t
you
see
that
there
s
a
man
s
shadow
come
come
on
i
sha
n
t
seize
him
in
bed
thunder
of
god
he
will
come
out
if
he
went
in
gudin
won
t
miss
him
cried
hulot
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
waiting
till
the
gars
could
defend
himself
commandant
i
enjoin
you
in
the
name
of
the
law
to
proceed
at
once
into
that
you
re
a
fine
scoundrel
to
try
to
make
me
do
without
showing
any
resentment
at
the
commandant
s
language
corentin
said
coolly
you
will
obey
me
here
is
an
order
in
good
form
signed
by
the
minister
of
war
which
will
force
you
to
do
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
do
you
suppose
we
are
such
fools
as
to
leave
that
girl
to
do
as
she
likes
we
are
endeavoring
to
suppress
a
civil
war
and
the
grandeur
of
the
purpose
covers
the
pettiness
of
the
i
take
the
liberty
citizen
of
sending
you
to
you
understand
me
enough
to
the
march
let
me
alone
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
but
read
that
persisted
corentin
don
t
bother
me
with
your
functions
cried
hulot
furious
at
receiving
orders
from
a
man
he
regarded
as
contemptible
at
this
instant
s
boy
suddenly
appeared
among
them
like
a
rat
from
a
hole
the
gars
has
started
he
cried
which
way
the
rue
said
hulot
in
a
whisper
to
the
corporal
who
was
near
him
go
and
tell
your
lieutenant
to
draw
in
closer
round
the
house
and
make
ready
to
fire
left
wheel
forward
on
the
tower
the
rest
of
you
he
shouted
to
understand
the
conclusion
of
this
fatal
drama
we
must
the
house
with
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
when
she
returned
to
it
after
denouncing
the
marquis
to
the
commandant
when
passions
reach
their
crisis
they
bring
us
under
the
dominion
of
far
greater
intoxication
than
the
petty
excitements
of
wine
or
opium
the
lucidity
then
given
to
ideas
the
delicacy
of
the
senses
produce
the
most
singular
and
unexpected
effects
some
persons
when
they
find
themselves
under
the
tyranny
of
a
single
thought
can
see
with
extraordinary
distinctness
objects
scarcely
visible
to
others
while
at
the
same
time
the
most
palpable
things
become
to
them
almost
as
if
they
did
not
exist
when
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
hurried
after
reading
the
marquis
s
letter
to
prepare
the
way
for
vengeance
just
as
she
had
lately
been
preparing
all
for
love
she
was
in
that
stage
of
mental
intoxication
which
makes
real
life
like
the
life
of
a
somnambulist
but
when
she
saw
her
house
surrounded
by
her
own
orders
with
a
triple
line
of
bayonets
a
sudden
flash
of
light
illuminated
her
soul
she
judged
her
conduct
and
saw
with
horror
that
she
had
committed
a
crime
under
the
first
shock
of
this
conviction
she
sprang
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
stood
there
irresolute
striving
to
think
yet
unable
to
follow
out
her
reasoning
she
knew
so
vaguely
what
had
happened
that
she
tried
in
vain
to
remember
why
she
was
in
the
antechamber
and
why
she
was
leading
a
strange
child
by
the
hand
a
million
of
stars
were
floating
in
the
air
before
her
like
tongues
of
fire
she
began
to
walk
about
striving
to
shake
off
the
horrible
torpor
which
laid
hold
of
her
but
like
one
asleep
no
object
appeared
to
her
under
its
natural
form
or
in
its
own
colors
she
grasped
the
hand
of
the
little
boy
with
a
violence
not
natural
to
her
dragging
him
along
with
such
precipitate
steps
that
she
seemed
to
have
the
motions
of
a
madwoman
she
saw
neither
persons
nor
things
in
the
salon
as
she
crossed
it
and
yet
she
was
saluted
by
three
men
who
made
way
to
let
her
pass
that
must
be
she
said
one
of
them
she
is
very
handsome
exclaimed
another
who
was
a
priest
yes
replied
the
first
but
how
pale
and
agitated
and
beside
herself
said
the
third
she
did
not
even
see
at
the
door
of
her
own
room
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
saw
the
smiling
face
of
francine
who
whispered
to
her
he
is
here
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
awoke
reflected
looked
at
the
child
whose
hand
she
held
remembered
all
and
replied
to
the
girl
shut
up
that
boy
if
you
wish
me
to
live
do
not
let
him
escape
as
she
slowly
said
the
words
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
of
her
bedroom
and
there
they
continued
fastened
with
so
dreadful
a
fixedness
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
saw
her
victim
through
the
wooden
panels
then
she
gently
opened
it
passed
through
and
closed
it
behind
her
without
turning
round
for
she
saw
the
marquis
standing
before
the
fireplace
his
dress
without
being
too
choice
had
the
look
of
careful
arrangement
which
adds
so
much
to
the
admiration
which
a
woman
feels
for
her
lover
all
her
came
back
to
her
at
the
sight
of
him
her
lips
rigid
although
showed
the
enamel
of
her
white
teeth
and
formed
a
smile
that
was
fixed
and
terrible
rather
than
voluptuous
she
walked
with
slow
steps
toward
the
young
man
and
pointed
with
her
finger
to
the
clock
a
man
who
is
worthy
of
love
is
worth
waiting
for
she
said
with
deceptive
gaiety
then
overcome
with
the
violence
of
her
emotions
she
dropped
upon
the
sofa
which
was
near
the
fireplace
dear
marie
you
are
so
charming
when
you
are
angry
said
the
marquis
sitting
down
beside
her
and
taking
her
hand
which
she
let
him
take
and
entreating
a
look
which
she
refused
him
i
hope
he
continued
in
a
tender
caressing
voice
that
my
wife
will
not
long
refuse
a
glance
to
her
loving
hearing
the
words
she
turned
abruptly
and
looked
into
his
eyes
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
dreadful
look
he
said
laughing
but
your
hand
is
burning
oh
my
love
what
is
it
your
love
she
repeated
in
a
dull
changed
voice
yes
he
said
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
taking
her
two
hands
which
he
covered
with
kisses
yes
my
love
i
am
thine
for
she
pushed
him
violently
away
from
her
and
rose
her
features
contracted
she
laughed
as
mad
people
laugh
and
then
she
said
to
him
you
do
not
mean
one
word
of
all
you
are
saying
base
man
baser
than
the
lowest
she
sprang
to
the
dagger
which
was
lying
beside
a
and
let
it
sparkle
before
the
eyes
of
the
amazed
young
marquis
bah
she
said
flinging
it
away
from
her
i
do
not
respect
you
enough
to
kill
you
your
blood
is
even
too
vile
to
be
shed
by
soldiers
i
see
nothing
fit
for
you
but
the
the
words
were
painfully
uttered
in
a
low
voice
and
she
moved
her
feet
like
a
spoilt
child
impatiently
the
marquis
went
to
her
and
tried
to
clasp
her
don
t
touch
me
she
cried
recoiling
from
him
with
a
look
of
horror
she
is
mad
said
the
marquis
in
despair
mad
yes
she
repeated
but
not
mad
enough
to
be
your
dupe
what
would
i
not
forgive
to
passion
but
to
seek
to
possess
me
without
love
and
to
write
to
that
woman
to
whom
have
i
written
he
said
with
an
astonishment
which
was
certainly
not
feigned
to
that
chaste
woman
who
sought
to
kill
the
marquis
turned
pale
with
anger
and
said
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
until
he
broke
it
if
madame
du
gua
has
committed
some
dastardly
wrong
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
looked
for
the
letter
not
finding
it
she
called
to
francine
where
is
that
letter
she
asked
monsieur
corentin
took
corentin
ah
i
understand
it
all
he
wrote
the
letter
he
has
deceived
me
with
diabolical
art
as
he
alone
can
with
a
piercing
cry
she
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
tears
rushing
from
her
eyes
doubt
and
confidence
were
equally
dreadful
now
the
marquis
knelt
beside
her
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
saying
again
and
again
the
only
words
he
was
able
to
utter
why
do
you
weep
my
darling
there
is
no
harm
done
your
reproaches
were
all
love
do
not
weep
i
love
you
i
shall
always
love
suddenly
he
felt
her
press
him
with
almost
supernatural
force
do
you
still
love
me
she
said
amid
her
sobs
can
you
doubt
it
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
was
almost
melancholy
she
abruptly
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
and
fled
as
if
frightened
and
confused
to
a
little
distance
do
i
doubt
it
she
exclaimed
but
a
smile
of
gentle
meaning
was
on
her
lover
s
face
and
the
words
died
away
upon
her
lips
she
let
him
take
her
by
the
hand
and
lead
her
to
the
salon
there
an
altar
had
been
hastily
arranged
during
her
absence
the
priest
was
robed
in
his
officiating
vestments
the
lighted
tapers
shed
upon
the
ceiling
a
glow
as
soft
as
hope
itself
she
now
recognized
the
two
men
who
had
bowed
to
her
the
comte
de
bauvan
and
the
baron
du
guenic
the
witnesses
chosen
by
montauran
you
will
not
still
refuse
said
the
marquis
but
at
the
sight
she
stopped
stepped
backward
into
her
chamber
and
fell
on
her
knees
raising
her
hands
towards
the
marquis
she
cried
out
pardon
pardon
pardon
her
voice
died
away
her
head
fell
back
her
eyes
closed
and
she
lay
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
and
francine
as
if
dead
when
she
opened
her
eyes
they
met
those
of
the
young
man
full
of
loving
tenderness
marie
patience
this
is
your
last
trial
he
said
the
last
she
exclaimed
bitterly
francine
and
the
marquis
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
but
she
silenced
them
by
a
gesture
call
the
priest
she
said
and
leave
me
alone
with
they
did
so
and
withdrew
my
father
she
said
to
the
priest
so
suddenly
called
to
her
in
my
childhood
an
old
man
like
yourself
used
to
tell
me
that
god
would
grant
all
things
to
those
who
had
faith
is
that
true
it
is
true
replied
the
priest
all
things
are
possible
to
him
who
created
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
with
incredible
enthusiasm
oh
my
god
she
cried
in
ecstasy
my
faith
in
thee
is
equal
to
my
love
for
him
inspire
me
do
here
a
miracle
or
take
my
life
your
prayer
will
be
granted
said
the
priest
marie
returned
to
the
salon
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
venerable
old
man
a
deep
and
secret
emotion
brought
her
to
the
arms
of
her
lover
more
brilliant
than
on
any
of
her
past
days
for
a
serenity
like
that
which
painters
give
to
the
martyrs
added
to
her
face
an
imposing
dignity
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
marquis
and
together
they
advanced
to
the
altar
and
knelt
down
the
marriage
was
about
to
be
celebrated
beside
the
nuptial
bed
the
altar
hastily
raised
the
cross
the
vessels
the
chalice
secretly
brought
thither
by
the
priest
the
fumes
of
incense
rising
to
the
ceiling
the
priest
himself
who
wore
a
stole
above
his
cassock
the
tapers
on
an
altar
in
a
salon
all
these
things
combined
to
form
a
strange
and
touching
scene
which
typified
those
times
of
saddest
memory
when
civil
discord
overthrew
all
sacred
institutions
religious
ceremonies
then
had
the
savor
of
the
mysteries
children
were
baptized
in
the
chambers
where
the
mothers
were
still
groaning
from
their
labor
as
in
the
olden
time
the
saviour
went
poor
and
lowly
to
console
the
dying
young
girls
received
their
first
communion
in
the
home
where
they
had
played
since
infancy
the
marriage
of
the
marquis
and
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
was
now
solemnized
like
many
other
unions
by
a
service
contrary
to
the
recent
legal
enactments
in
after
years
these
marriages
mostly
celebrated
at
the
foot
of
oaks
were
scrupulously
recognized
and
considered
legal
the
priest
who
thus
preserved
the
ancient
usages
was
one
of
those
men
who
hold
to
their
principles
in
the
height
of
the
storm
his
voice
which
never
made
the
oath
exacted
by
the
republic
uttered
no
word
throughout
the
tempest
that
did
not
make
for
peace
he
never
incited
like
the
abbe
gudin
to
fire
and
sword
but
like
many
others
he
devoted
himself
to
the
still
more
dangerous
mission
of
performing
his
priestly
functions
for
the
souls
of
faithful
catholics
to
accomplish
this
perilous
ministry
he
used
all
the
pious
deceptions
necessitated
by
persecution
and
the
marquis
when
he
sought
his
services
on
this
occasion
had
found
him
in
one
of
those
excavated
caverns
which
are
known
even
to
the
present
day
by
the
name
of
the
priest
s
the
mere
sight
of
that
pale
and
suffering
face
was
enough
to
give
this
worldly
room
a
holy
aspect
all
was
now
ready
for
the
act
of
misery
and
of
joy
before
beginning
the
ceremony
the
priest
asked
in
the
dead
silence
the
names
of
the
bride
daughter
of
mademoiselle
blanche
de
casteran
abbess
deceased
of
de
seez
and
duc
de
where
born
at
la
chasterie
near
i
never
supposed
said
the
baron
in
a
low
voice
to
the
count
that
montauran
would
have
the
folly
to
marry
her
the
natural
daughter
of
a
duke
horrid
if
it
were
of
the
king
well
and
good
replied
the
comte
de
bauvan
smiling
however
it
is
not
for
me
to
blame
him
i
like
charette
s
mistress
full
as
well
and
i
shall
transfer
the
war
to
her
though
she
s
not
one
to
bill
and
the
names
of
the
marquis
had
been
filled
in
previously
and
the
two
lovers
now
signed
the
document
with
their
witnesses
the
ceremony
then
began
at
that
instant
marie
and
she
alone
heard
the
sound
of
muskets
and
the
heavy
tread
of
soldiers
no
doubt
relieving
the
guard
in
the
church
which
she
had
herself
demanded
she
trembled
violently
and
raised
her
eyes
to
the
cross
on
the
altar
a
saint
at
last
said
francine
in
a
low
voice
give
me
such
saints
and
i
ll
be
devilishly
devout
added
the
count
in
a
whisper
when
the
priest
made
the
customary
inquiry
of
mademoiselle
de
verneuil
she
answered
by
a
yes
uttered
with
a
deep
sigh
bending
to
her
husband
s
ear
she
said
you
will
soon
know
why
i
have
broken
the
oath
i
made
never
to
marry
after
the
ceremony
all
present
passed
into
the
where
dinner
was
served
and
as
they
took
their
places
jeremie
marie
s
footman
came
into
the
room
terrified
the
poor
bride
rose
and
went
to
him
francine
followed
her
with
one
of
those
pretexts
which
never
fail
a
woman
she
begged
the
marquis
to
do
the
honors
for
a
moment
and
went
out
taking
jeremie
with
her
before
he
could
utter
the
fatal
words
ah
francine
to
be
dying
a
thousand
deaths
and
not
to
die
she
cried
this
absence
might
well
be
supposed
to
have
its
cause
in
the
ceremony
that
had
just
taken
place
towards
the
end
of
the
dinner
as
the
marquis
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
marie
returned
in
all
the
pomp
of
a
bridal
robe
her
face
was
calm
and
joyful
while
that
of
francine
who
followed
her
had
terror
imprinted
on
every
feature
so
that
the
guests
might
well
have
thought
they
saw
in
these
two
women
a
fantastic
picture
by
salvator
rosa
of
life
and
death
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
gentlemen
said
marie
to
the
priest
the
baron
and
the
count
you
are
my
guests
for
the
night
i
find
you
can
not
leave
fougeres
it
would
be
dangerous
to
attempt
it
my
good
maid
has
instructions
to
make
you
comfortable
in
your
apartments
no
you
must
not
rebel
she
added
to
the
priest
who
was
about
to
speak
i
hope
you
will
not
thwart
a
woman
on
her
an
hour
later
she
was
alone
with
her
husband
in
the
room
she
had
so
joyously
arranged
a
few
hours
earlier
they
had
reached
that
fatal
bed
where
like
a
tomb
so
many
hopes
are
wrecked
where
the
waking
to
a
happy
life
is
all
uncertain
where
love
is
born
or
dies
according
to
the
natures
that
are
tried
there
marie
looked
at
the
clock
six
hours
to
live
she
murmured
can
i
have
slept
she
cried
toward
morning
wakening
with
one
of
those
sudden
movements
which
rouse
us
when
we
have
made
ourselves
a
promise
to
wake
at
a
certain
hour
yes
i
have
slept
she
thought
seeing
by
the
light
of
the
candles
that
the
hands
of
the
clock
were
pointing
to
two
in
the
morning
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
sleeping
marquis
lying
like
a
child
with
his
head
on
one
hand
the
other
clasping
his
wife
s
hand
his
lips
half
smiling
as
though
he
had
fallen
asleep
while
she
kissed
him
ah
she
whispered
to
herself
he
sleeps
like
an
infant
he
does
not
distrust
me
me
to
whom
he
has
given
a
happiness
without
a
she
touched
him
softly
and
he
woke
continuing
to
smile
he
kissed
the
hand
he
held
and
looked
at
the
wretched
woman
with
eyes
so
sparkling
that
she
could
not
endure
their
light
and
slowly
lowered
her
large
eyelids
her
husband
might
justly
have
accused
her
of
coquetry
if
she
were
not
concealing
the
terrors
of
her
soul
by
thus
evading
the
fire
of
his
looks
together
they
raised
their
charming
heads
and
made
each
other
a
sign
of
gratitude
for
the
pleasures
they
had
tasted
but
after
a
rapid
glance
at
the
beautiful
picture
his
wife
presented
the
marquis
was
struck
with
an
expression
on
her
face
which
seemed
to
him
melancholy
and
he
said
in
a
tender
voice
why
sad
dear
love
poor
alphonse
she
answered
do
you
know
to
what
i
have
led
you
to
to
death
shuddering
with
horror
she
sprang
from
the
bed
the
marquis
astonished
followed
her
his
wife
motioned
him
to
a
window
and
raised
the
curtain
pointing
as
she
did
so
to
a
score
of
soldiers
the
moon
had
scattered
the
fog
and
was
now
casting
her
white
light
on
the
muskets
and
the
uniforms
on
the
impassible
corentin
pacing
up
and
down
like
a
jackal
waiting
for
his
prey
on
the
commandant
standing
still
his
arms
crossed
his
nose
in
the
air
his
lips
curling
watchful
and
displeased
come
marie
leave
them
and
come
back
to
why
do
you
smile
i
placed
them
you
are
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
the
marquis
divined
the
whole
truth
and
he
took
her
in
his
arms
no
matter
he
said
i
love
you
all
is
not
lost
cried
marie
it
can
not
be
alphonse
she
said
after
a
pause
there
is
at
this
moment
they
distinctly
heard
the
owl
s
cry
and
francine
entered
from
the
pierre
has
come
she
said
with
a
joy
that
was
like
delirium
the
marquise
and
francine
dressed
montauran
in
chouan
clothes
with
that
amazing
rapidity
that
belongs
only
to
women
as
soon
as
marie
saw
her
husband
loading
the
gun
francine
had
brought
in
she
slipped
hastily
from
the
room
with
a
sign
to
her
faithful
maid
francine
then
took
the
marquis
to
the
adjoining
the
the
young
man
seeing
a
large
number
of
sheets
knotted
firmly
together
perceived
the
means
by
which
the
girl
expected
him
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
soldiers
i
can
t
get
through
there
he
said
examining
the
bull
window
at
that
instant
it
was
darkened
by
a
thickset
figure
and
a
hoarse
voice
known
to
francine
said
in
a
whisper
make
haste
general
those
rascally
blues
are
oh
one
more
kiss
said
a
trembling
voice
beside
him
the
marquis
whose
feet
were
already
on
the
liberating
ladder
though
he
was
not
wholly
through
the
window
felt
his
neck
clasped
with
a
despairing
pressure
seeing
that
his
wife
had
put
on
his
clothes
he
tried
to
detain
her
but
she
tore
herself
roughly
from
his
arms
and
he
was
forced
to
descend
in
his
hand
he
held
a
fragment
of
some
stuff
which
the
moonlight
showed
him
was
a
piece
of
the
waistcoat
he
had
worn
the
night
before
halt
fire
these
words
uttered
by
hulot
in
the
midst
of
a
silence
that
was
almost
horrible
broke
the
spell
which
seemed
to
hold
the
men
and
their
surroundings
a
volley
of
balls
coming
from
the
valley
and
reaching
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
succeeded
the
discharges
of
the
blues
posted
on
the
promenade
not
a
cry
came
from
the
chouans
between
each
discharge
the
silence
was
frightful
but
corentin
had
heard
a
fall
from
the
ladder
on
the
precipice
side
of
the
tower
and
he
suspected
some
ruse
none
of
those
animals
are
growling
he
said
to
hulot
our
lovers
are
capable
of
fooling
us
on
this
side
and
escaping
themselves
on
the
the
spy
to
clear
up
the
mystery
sent
for
torches
hulot
understanding
the
force
of
corentin
s
supposition
and
hearing
the
noise
of
a
serious
struggle
in
the
direction
of
the
porte
rushed
to
the
exclaiming
that
s
true
they
won
t
his
head
is
commandant
said
who
was
the
first
to
meet
him
but
he
killed
gudin
and
wounded
two
men
ha
the
savage
he
got
through
three
ranks
of
our
best
men
and
would
have
reached
the
fields
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
sentry
at
the
gate
who
spitted
him
on
his
the
commandant
rushed
into
the
and
saw
on
a
camp
bedstead
a
bloody
body
which
had
just
been
laid
there
he
went
up
to
the
supposed
marquis
raised
the
hat
which
covered
the
face
and
fell
into
a
chair
i
suspected
it
he
cried
crossing
his
arms
violently
she
kept
him
cursed
thunder
too
the
soldiers
stood
about
motionless
the
commandant
himself
unfastened
the
long
black
hair
of
a
woman
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
tramp
of
men
and
corentin
entered
the
guardroom
preceding
four
soldiers
who
bore
on
their
guns
crossed
to
make
a
litter
the
body
of
montauran
who
was
shot
in
the
thighs
and
arms
they
laid
him
on
the
bedstead
beside
his
wife
he
saw
her
and
found
strength
to
clasp
her
hand
with
a
convulsive
gesture
the
dying
woman
turned
her
head
recognized
her
husband
and
shuddered
with
a
spasm
that
was
horrible
to
see
murmuring
in
a
voice
almost
extinct
a
day
without
a
morrow
god
heard
me
too
well
commandant
said
the
marquis
collecting
all
his
strength
and
still
holding
marie
s
hand
i
count
on
your
honor
to
send
the
news
of
my
death
to
my
young
brother
who
is
now
in
london
write
him
that
if
he
wishes
to
obey
my
last
injunction
he
will
never
bear
arms
against
his
country
neither
must
he
abandon
the
king
s
it
shall
be
done
said
hulot
pressing
the
hand
of
the
dying
man
take
them
to
the
nearest
hospital
cried
corentin
hulot
took
the
spy
by
the
arm
with
a
grip
that
left
the
imprint
of
his
fingers
on
the
flesh
out
of
this
camp
he
cried
your
business
is
done
here
look
well
at
the
face
of
commander
hulot
and
never
find
yourself
again
in
his
way
if
you
don
t
want
your
belly
to
be
the
scabbard
of
his
blade
and
the
older
soldier
flourished
his
sabre
that
s
another
of
the
honest
men
who
will
never
make
their
way
said
corentin
to
himself
when
he
was
some
distance
from
the
the
marquis
was
still
able
to
thank
his
gallant
adversary
by
a
look
marking
the
respect
which
all
soldiers
feel
for
loyal
enemies
in
an
old
man
accompanied
by
his
wife
was
buying
cattle
in
the
of
fougeres
few
persons
remembered
that
he
had
killed
a
hundred
or
more
men
and
that
his
former
name
was
a
person
to
whom
we
owe
important
information
about
all
the
personages
of
this
drama
saw
him
there
leading
a
cow
and
was
struck
by
his
simple
ingenuous
air
which
led
her
to
remark
that
must
be
a
worthy
as
for
cibot
otherwise
called
we
already
know
his
end
it
is
likely
that
made
some
attempt
to
save
his
comrade
from
the
scaffold

he
was
in
the
square
at
